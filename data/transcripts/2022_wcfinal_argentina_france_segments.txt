[0.00 - 2.00] P:1664.99 E:0.094941 |  Their key players into the game.
[2.80 - 7.52] P:1787.74 E:0.109163 |  Messi with Di Maria on that right-hand side, up against Southern McConnell.
[7.52 - 9.52] P:1832.04 E:0.095874 |  And Hernandez could be the key batter.
[10.24 - 14.88] P:1941.30 E:0.115978 |  Well, 29 days ago, this Winter World Cup was under way.
[15.52 - 18.32] P:1919.45 E:0.101753 |  And now here we are, match 64.
[18.64 - 21.68] P:1770.18 E:0.090793 |  And what a final it is in prospect.
[23.04 - 25.04] P:1825.40 E:0.104640 |  Messi against Mbappe.
[25.36 - 28.32] P:1909.72 E:0.106682 |  A footballing oasis in the desert.
[29.12 - 32.40] P:1863.42 E:0.114736 |  And it is certainly a real dip.
[32.40 - 36.00] P:1742.96 E:0.108808 |  Being created by a mass of jumping.
[36.00 - 39.36] P:1588.64 E:0.110356 |  Argentinian supporters in the end away towards RL.
[40.48 - 42.64] P:1631.71 E:0.113745 |  I think it's fair to say they're excited.
[42.64 - 46.48] P:1748.86 E:0.111581 |  It is. And just looking at the Argentine set up.
[46.48 - 49.28] P:1719.02 E:0.112112 |  Di Maria started on that left-hand side.
[49.28 - 52.32] P:1675.43 E:0.110666 |  I think we all thought he was going to start on the right-hand side.
[52.88 - 55.28] P:1670.93 E:0.112067 |  And De Paul will be the one helping out Molina.
[55.92 - 57.92] P:1723.48 E:0.090918 |  And doubling up on Mbappe.
[58.40 - 60.16] P:1729.59 E:0.101508 |  They narrow off the right.
[60.16 - 63.44] P:1789.79 E:0.106489 |  So Argentina are playing from left to right as we look.
[64.32 - 69.44] P:1666.27 E:0.114504 |  Here in the banks of the media tribute in this very impressive stadium in the city of Lusail.
[69.44 - 72.72] P:1660.08 E:0.087798 |  Nine miles north of Doha.
[72.72 - 77.92] P:1741.46 E:0.102196 |  And the other thing to say as well is that this will be the highest attendance for a World Cup final.
[77.92 - 83.76] P:1639.70 E:0.106111 |  Since 1994, when there are over 94,000 watching Brazil against Italy.
[84.16 - 87.76] P:1861.68 E:0.107765 |  In the United States.
[89.44 - 92.08] P:1748.76 E:0.105471 |  It's going to take some time to settle down.
[92.08 - 94.16] P:1747.52 E:0.093034 |  Back to Emi Martinez.
[94.16 - 95.12] P:1608.42 E:0.109753 |  All in green.
[95.12 - 96.08] P:1685.94 E:0.099471 |  He clears it away.
[96.72 - 98.80] P:1740.19 E:0.106387 |  Teo Hernandez controls the ball.
[98.80 - 101.76] P:1779.15 E:0.105630 |  Rabio plays it out towards Hernandez on this near side.
[102.32 - 104.96] P:1846.13 E:0.112904 |  And now back to Abumacano.
[104.96 - 108.40] P:1802.05 E:0.111933 |  As De Paul just running into Rabio.
[108.40 - 109.68] P:1786.98 E:0.100543 |  And the referee quickly.
[110.40 - 113.20] P:1878.70 E:0.115822 |  Polish referee Marciniak wanting to stamp that out.
[113.76 - 116.40] P:1846.81 E:0.117632 |  Just a little nudge in the back there from De Paul and Rabio.
[116.96 - 119.36] P:1878.61 E:0.111465 |  A bit of a silly shove from De Paul.
[119.36 - 125.44] P:1756.80 E:0.106066 |  The position he's playing is going to have to engage in Mbappe on numerous occasions and help out Molina.
[125.44 - 129.12] P:1687.99 E:0.101456 |  So what he want is an early cheat booking.
[129.76 - 134.72] P:1711.68 E:0.121812 |  Just a little wag of the index finger from the De Paul referee.
[135.60 - 138.40] P:1880.83 E:0.106695 |  And quite clearly the message whilst to cut it out is.
[138.40 - 141.12] P:1748.62 E:0.102051 |  Argentina take a throw on the left hand side.
[141.20 - 142.56] P:1748.40 E:0.096085 |  McAllister to Messi.
[142.56 - 143.60] P:1698.44 E:0.101984 |  Central area.
[143.60 - 146.72] P:1802.71 E:0.105509 |  Plays the ball left footed out towards Demiria.
[146.72 - 149.60] P:1795.56 E:0.101732 |  Demiria hooks over the cross on the volley.
[149.60 - 150.24] P:1665.13 E:0.105098 |  Messi waits.
[150.24 - 151.52] P:1680.41 E:0.106159 |  Rabio with a header away.
[151.52 - 153.28] P:1787.05 E:0.085036 |  De Paul back towards Messi.
[153.28 - 154.96] P:1780.04 E:0.104788 |  To De Paul outside the area.
[154.96 - 156.08] P:1886.98 E:0.108669 |  Scoops the ball forward.
[156.08 - 157.36] P:1809.05 E:0.108255 |  Alvarez is there.
[157.36 - 157.92] P:1791.92 E:0.096137 |  Flags up.
[157.92 - 158.72] P:1663.10 E:0.100957 |  It was a late play.
[159.92 - 160.56] P:1826.93 E:0.115204 |  Has good call.
[161.60 - 162.88] P:1950.77 E:0.115884 |  Just straight a yard offside.
[162.88 - 165.36] P:1806.67 E:0.097994 |  Was expecting the ball from De Paul a little bit quicker.
[166.16 - 170.64] P:1763.97 E:0.089199 |  Just timed his run so that it was a fraction too early from Alvarez.
[170.72 - 171.60] P:1652.38 E:0.082566 |  Bucks bright.
[171.60 - 172.96] P:1732.50 E:0.093947 |  They're getting Messi on the ball.
[172.96 - 174.56] P:1809.66 E:0.101423 |  Getting him in around the penalty area.
[176.24 - 182.56] P:1742.48 E:0.100714 |  Argentina have scored first in all six of their World Cup matches here in Qatar.
[183.44 - 187.12] P:1750.44 E:0.117851 |  Hugo Larisse all in yellow away towards our right hand side.
[187.12 - 188.88] P:1595.28 E:0.107492 |  Strikes it away downfield.
[190.32 - 191.28] P:1653.55 E:0.128373 |  Jiru with a flick.
[191.28 - 192.88] P:1636.13 E:0.103480 |  Heder Griezmann was also there.
[193.60 - 196.80] P:1619.31 E:0.107645 |  Brought under control and then played back towards Romero.
[196.80 - 199.44] P:1627.99 E:0.095056 |  Lifted long into the centre circle.
[199.52 - 202.08] P:1789.03 E:0.105645 |  Towering header from Upper Mercano.
[202.08 - 203.52] P:1851.97 E:0.096806 |  But he's come through the back of Messi.
[203.52 - 205.04] P:1817.19 E:0.104459 |  Says the Polish referee.
[205.04 - 206.56] P:1861.38 E:0.087076 |  Free kick to Argentina.
[206.56 - 207.76] P:1733.24 E:0.100386 |  That's slightly harsh.
[207.76 - 210.32] P:1739.92 E:0.089657 |  That was a straight ball clipped up and
[211.52 - 214.80] P:1732.70 E:0.103037 |  Upper Mercano is always going to be Messi in the air.
[214.80 - 216.80] P:1716.90 E:0.075947 |  He does catch him.
[217.36 - 221.36] P:1789.54 E:0.102467 |  I think Didier Deschamps is overly pleased with that decision.
[222.16 - 224.32] P:1780.44 E:0.104617 |  It's a World Cup record for Lionel Messi.
[226.32 - 228.24] P:1637.63 E:0.116887 |  His 26th appearance.
[229.44 - 234.16] P:1614.79 E:0.105181 |  At a World Cup for what is likely to be his fifth and final World Cup finals.
[236.80 - 240.00] P:1723.57 E:0.102903 |  Beating the record set by Lota Mateos.
[241.52 - 246.16] P:1667.52 E:0.095730 |  And in those previous 25 11 goals and eight assists.
[247.52 - 248.48] P:1765.01 E:0.123036 |  As Argentina.
[250.16 - 252.80] P:1737.15 E:0.098290 |  Attack on that far side the left.
[252.80 - 255.52] P:1730.68 E:0.115989 |  Di Maria trying to come in between two French players.
[256.48 - 259.52] P:1698.24 E:0.116756 |  Kunde and Dembele out of play it will go for a throw.
[259.52 - 261.76] P:1652.40 E:0.092591 |  Talia Fico will take it quickly.
[262.56 - 264.16] P:1620.29 E:0.080911 |  Looking for it to settle.
[264.16 - 270.24] P:1898.94 E:0.098992 |  And Bafé comes into the central area to get the ball back for the dark shirts of France.
[270.24 - 271.76] P:1861.83 E:0.125505 |  Teo Hernandez is giving away.
[271.76 - 272.88] P:1844.09 E:0.102533 |  Straight towards Messi.
[272.88 - 273.76] P:1857.05 E:0.092446 |  Lays it off.
[273.76 - 274.96] P:1764.03 E:0.113372 |  De Paul driving forward.
[274.96 - 277.60] P:1768.72 E:0.100493 |  McAllister making the run through the middle ahead of it.
[277.60 - 281.04] P:1738.77 E:0.099196 |  He went out wide towards the left towards Di Maria.
[281.04 - 282.24] P:1769.40 E:0.102178 |  And Kunde will clear.
[282.96 - 284.08] P:1714.35 E:0.127278 |  France are giving the ball away.
[284.08 - 285.76] P:1826.23 E:0.113735 |  They made another error here.
[285.76 - 287.36] P:1836.54 E:0.118071 |  Shot comes in from distance.
[287.36 - 290.88] P:1819.92 E:0.108250 |  The real tile driver as well from McAllister.
[290.88 - 294.88] P:1786.40 E:0.100099 |  But Leriz with his body behind the ball made a comfortable save.
[294.88 - 296.64] P:1873.70 E:0.101122 |  As a nervy start from France.
[296.64 - 297.68] P:1787.35 E:0.090892 |  Number of mistakes.
[298.40 - 300.24] P:1605.19 E:0.112129 |  Leriz straight into the mid-riff.
[300.24 - 301.60] P:1764.87 E:0.096673 |  Great ball for the catch.
[301.60 - 304.00] P:1729.80 E:0.104842 |  But France has got to get a foot on the ball.
[304.00 - 304.72] P:1831.19 E:0.107458 |  Get a hold of it.
[304.72 - 305.68] P:1861.81 E:0.102936 |  Get a feel of it.
[305.68 - 306.48] P:1902.39 E:0.103408 |  Get into the game.
[307.20 - 310.00] P:1723.36 E:0.114578 |  Just as a reminder this is live on BBC One.
[310.08 - 313.76] P:1805.55 E:0.102972 |  You can watch and listen through World Cup Extra on the iPlayer.
[313.76 - 316.40] P:1784.97 E:0.112100 |  To listen to the five live commentary if you so wish.
[316.40 - 321.04] P:1707.09 E:0.103171 |  We have Chris Sutton and Rob Green with us here in Lusail.
[321.04 - 321.60] P:1600.90 E:0.114328 |  Nil Nil.
[323.04 - 324.72] P:1605.50 E:0.108671 |  The ball is played back.
[324.72 - 325.68] P:1790.69 E:0.100882 |  Just need to settle it.
[325.68 - 328.56] P:1678.21 E:0.107634 |  Don't they the reigning champions do look nervy?
[329.44 - 330.16] P:1559.46 E:0.110006 |  Yes they do.
[330.16 - 333.60] P:1664.63 E:0.105793 |  It was a Griezmann who's had such a good tournament.
[333.60 - 335.04] P:1724.89 E:0.111779 |  Carelessly giving the ball away.
[336.40 - 338.40] P:1725.30 E:0.120603 |  Just outside his own 18-yard box.
[338.40 - 340.40] P:1735.47 E:0.105988 |  Which allowed the shot from McAllister.
[340.40 - 342.16] P:1648.19 E:0.112340 |  But just trying to get a foothold now.
[342.16 - 343.12] P:1631.54 E:0.087431 |  France in the game.
[343.12 - 344.16] P:1641.10 E:0.109180 |  Make a few passes.
[345.28 - 348.24] P:1797.03 E:0.112759 |  What is interesting is that Argentina have...
[348.24 - 350.64] P:1757.51 E:0.106533 |  This is their fifth match that they played here in Lusail.
[351.76 - 354.08] P:1850.47 E:0.118077 |  Saudi Arabia and Mexico in the group stages.
[354.08 - 356.72] P:1865.19 E:0.106227 |  Netherlands in the Croatia in the knockout stages.
[357.36 - 364.16] P:1808.94 E:0.084005 |  This is the first visit to Lusail for France here in this World Cup final.
[365.28 - 366.40] P:1625.10 E:0.093938 |  Six minutes play.
[366.40 - 368.00] P:1526.61 E:0.089198 |  Dembele right hand side.
[368.40 - 369.44] P:1481.72 E:0.097151 |  Back with Kunde.
[370.24 - 372.00] P:1682.79 E:0.085118 |  Now to Verran.
[372.00 - 374.64] P:1752.78 E:0.100496 |  One of the players who's recovered from illness.
[374.64 - 379.36] P:1745.29 E:0.097196 |  Another one is Ufa Macano as the two central defenders exchange passes.
[379.36 - 380.88] P:1648.07 E:0.109393 |  Just outside the centre circle.
[381.68 - 383.84] P:1798.20 E:0.117065 |  Verran now with Ufa Macano.
[383.84 - 386.40] P:1839.49 E:0.118169 |  Lionel Scoloni is out in that technical area.
[388.16 - 388.96] P:1757.32 E:0.129011 |  Back with Verran.
[388.96 - 390.40] P:1760.81 E:0.111159 |  Not really going anywhere at the moment.
[390.40 - 392.72] P:1724.13 E:0.107055 |  If anything they've been crossed slightly backwards here France.
[393.60 - 396.32] P:1766.95 E:0.112939 |  This message just runs towards Ufa Macano.
[396.32 - 397.92] P:1697.69 E:0.105309 |  And he passes the ball out wide.
[398.40 - 401.52] P:1696.79 E:0.101784 |  Talia Fico with interception before it could reach Dembele.
[401.52 - 402.80] P:1648.80 E:0.107650 |  Griezmann now takes over.
[402.80 - 405.68] P:1809.06 E:0.112971 |  Tchoua many runs through the centre circle on the halfway line.
[407.20 - 412.72] P:1859.51 E:0.117128 |  Alvarez who was in pursuit is just pulled back at the arm of Rabio.
[412.72 - 413.76] P:1694.04 E:0.102676 |  And it gives away a free kick.
[413.76 - 414.40] P:1795.91 E:0.070954 |  Rob.
[414.40 - 417.68] P:1776.36 E:0.090863 |  Yeah it's interesting that France when they get the ball.
[417.68 - 420.24] P:1875.54 E:0.101183 |  Teo Landa as we know he's likely to go up high.
[420.24 - 422.88] P:1773.23 E:0.082174 |  They get converted to a flatback three almost.
[422.88 - 424.96] P:1754.64 E:0.098821 |  And that lends itself to Argentina.
[425.68 - 427.04] P:1781.26 E:0.096919 |  Pressing man for man.
[427.04 - 431.12] P:1834.82 E:0.105446 |  And they're not moving the ball quick enough to cause Argentina problems.
[433.52 - 434.24] P:1540.55 E:0.140909 |  In the midfield.
[435.04 - 436.64] P:1798.37 E:0.108209 |  Now with Messi for Argentina.
[436.64 - 438.88] P:1761.34 E:0.116886 |  Threads a lovely ball through towards McAllister.
[438.88 - 441.04] P:1829.20 E:0.110952 |  McAllister has Demiria ahead of him.
[441.04 - 442.88] P:1793.96 E:0.112297 |  Streaking away on the left hand side.
[442.88 - 443.84] P:1735.09 E:0.096328 |  Alvarez waits.
[443.84 - 446.00] P:1750.65 E:0.090663 |  DePaul just on the edge of the area.
[446.00 - 446.48] P:1601.06 E:0.104772 |  Held up.
[446.48 - 448.08] P:1728.62 E:0.109157 |  There is Demiria on the left.
[448.08 - 449.92] P:1723.79 E:0.078588 |  McAllister back inside.
[449.92 - 451.28] P:1503.21 E:0.082581 |  This is Fernandez.
[451.28 - 453.52] P:1736.84 E:0.098428 |  Short tackle ball cut out by Griezmann.
[453.52 - 454.80] P:1662.28 E:0.113697 |  It'll break to Alvarez.
[454.80 - 455.44] P:1698.39 E:0.114772 |  Ever alert.
[455.44 - 456.64] P:1748.75 E:0.103696 |  Lays it up towards Demiria.
[456.64 - 458.24] P:1750.88 E:0.103313 |  Left hand side of the penalty area.
[458.24 - 461.12] P:1792.63 E:0.105800 |  With the cut back edge of the area to DePaul.
[461.12 - 462.08] P:1873.67 E:0.113364 |  DePaul with a shot.
[462.08 - 464.32] P:1791.39 E:0.095856 |  Texting reflection of the legs of Iran.
[464.32 - 466.40] P:1800.16 E:0.121774 |  And behind it goes for a corner kick.
[466.40 - 467.20] P:1855.73 E:0.095698 |  0-0.
[467.20 - 470.64] P:1771.73 E:0.103871 |  Yeah really positive start from Argentina.
[470.64 - 473.52] P:1650.69 E:0.103522 |  Demiria causing problems on that left hand side.
[473.52 - 475.44] P:1675.92 E:0.104427 |  Balls across back to DePaul.
[475.44 - 477.68] P:1668.03 E:0.101516 |  He's got 20 yards out who hammers the shot.
[477.68 - 479.52] P:1692.75 E:0.104209 |  It was actually going well wide.
[479.52 - 482.08] P:1598.30 E:0.107632 |  Off for Rams left shin and behind.
[482.88 - 484.24] P:1603.08 E:0.117856 |  With corner to Argentina.
[484.96 - 487.84] P:1611.35 E:0.107554 |  Argentina have made the better start.
[489.04 - 490.56] P:1538.85 E:0.112855 |  Within playing for eight minutes.
[494.48 - 499.52] P:1576.88 E:0.114207 |  Messi waits just adjust the ball in the in the quadrant down below.
[500.64 - 502.96] P:1645.30 E:0.111198 |  Corner kick on this near side the right.
[502.96 - 505.76] P:1483.00 E:0.103949 |  For Argentina playing from left to right.
[507.52 - 509.04] P:1593.93 E:0.111268 |  Messi delivers it low.
[509.04 - 510.72] P:1595.28 E:0.105923 |  Cleared by Griezmann at the near post.
[510.72 - 512.96] P:1586.16 E:0.091913 |  DePaul plays it back out towards Messi.
[513.04 - 514.32] P:1708.67 E:0.109758 |  Controls it first time.
[514.32 - 515.60] P:1684.92 E:0.104517 |  Looks to try and run at Griezmann.
[515.60 - 516.56] P:1716.92 E:0.105947 |  They doubled up on it.
[516.56 - 518.48] P:1621.49 E:0.097338 |  And Bapé was helping out Griezmann.
[518.48 - 521.12] P:1676.57 E:0.108594 |  DePaul now will send over an arcing cross.
[521.12 - 523.04] P:1778.12 E:0.107520 |  Plenty of Navy shirts are back there.
[523.04 - 524.40] P:1597.07 E:0.113365 |  It goes high in the air.
[524.40 - 525.84] P:1748.35 E:0.115638 |  Rabiot goes to ground.
[525.84 - 527.44] P:1800.07 E:0.118446 |  Larise can't get on the end of it.
[527.44 - 528.88] P:1823.61 E:0.100662 |  Referee's blown his whistle.
[528.88 - 530.88] P:1855.21 E:0.108994 |  There was a foul on Larise who's down.
[530.88 - 532.72] P:1806.04 E:0.111470 |  No I'm not a goalkeeping expert.
[532.72 - 536.08] P:1884.78 E:0.116739 |  We've got Rob who is but that's that ball goes up in the air.
[536.08 - 537.84] P:1867.36 E:0.106194 |  Initially the Rabiot head up.
[537.84 - 539.52] P:1872.41 E:0.103488 |  I think Larise has to come for that.
[539.52 - 542.40] P:1803.86 E:0.107226 |  It's a really difficult one going up in the nice sky.
[543.04 - 544.00] P:1740.89 E:0.123342 |  Swirling around.
[544.72 - 547.04] P:1677.49 E:0.103064 |  But you look and you think, can I catch it?
[547.92 - 551.12] P:1655.10 E:0.109465 |  As you told him to do in the past, just catch it Larise.
[551.76 - 555.20] P:1609.02 E:0.110128 |  I think it's such a high ball and there's so many bodies
[555.20 - 557.04] P:1612.47 E:0.091609 |  it can't make that clean claim.
[557.04 - 558.72] P:1567.49 E:0.107993 |  He then gets caught by Romero.
[559.60 - 561.04] P:1709.11 E:0.100131 |  I think that's his casing point.
[562.32 - 563.44] P:1390.38 E:0.120832 |  Just like the supporters.
[563.44 - 566.80] P:1731.49 E:0.096651 |  It's been a lively start from the Argentinian players for something.
[567.52 - 568.40] P:1615.68 E:0.101156 |  Oh it has been.
[568.40 - 570.16] P:1495.74 E:0.090870 |  The team on the front foot.
[570.56 - 572.40] P:1602.13 E:0.078029 |  Worrying for Didier Deschamps.
[572.40 - 573.28] P:1709.24 E:0.103106 |  Larise down.
[573.28 - 576.80] P:1638.85 E:0.084094 |  Took one and the ribs from his top and team mate.
[578.16 - 581.68] P:1922.67 E:0.104825 |  Just interesting that he's touched on it before Chris.
[581.68 - 583.68] P:2010.14 E:0.112954 |  How Argentina have set up.
[583.68 - 586.64] P:2024.38 E:0.105912 |  We thought that he, Maria, start on the right.
[586.64 - 590.16] P:1968.05 E:0.106071 |  He's very, very high, very, very wide on the left.
[590.16 - 592.16] P:1844.40 E:0.101539 |  And they're looking for him early.
[592.16 - 594.00] P:1884.92 E:0.095744 |  And a big switch to get out there.
[594.00 - 597.20] P:1785.71 E:0.093366 |  And from there you then say get bodies around it.
[597.20 - 598.32] P:1675.37 E:0.099037 |  And that's what they've done well.
[598.32 - 602.00] P:1691.67 E:0.100196 |  Has to be concerned though here for Hugo Larise.
[602.00 - 604.00] P:1697.22 E:0.072800 |  Romero it was who caught it.
[606.00 - 608.72] P:1517.43 E:0.087398 |  I think in fairness to Romero, as the ball goes up in the air,
[608.72 - 615.68] P:1564.34 E:0.099011 |  Upa Magano shoves Romero who then flies into Larise.
[615.68 - 621.04] P:1571.64 E:0.097786 |  The longer he's down, he's sitting up now which is an encouraging sign.
[622.64 - 626.08] P:1550.98 E:0.105859 |  Lent the stoppage though for the French captain.
[626.24 - 629.20] P:1574.91 E:0.088073 |  Started five of the six games out here in Qatar.
[629.20 - 632.24] P:1552.27 E:0.110978 |  Excellent against England and Morocco.
[632.24 - 634.80] P:1594.62 E:0.101403 |  Interesting that he kept three clean sheets in sixth
[634.80 - 638.24] P:1714.31 E:0.101715 |  when they won the World Cup four years ago in Russia.
[638.24 - 640.80] P:1708.21 E:0.098961 |  He's only kept the one clean sheet so far.
[640.80 - 642.80] P:1738.99 E:0.102342 |  But at least he looks able to continue.
[643.92 - 646.08] P:1807.80 E:0.099515 |  Gold keepers have gone soft, haven't they?
[646.08 - 649.44] P:1660.69 E:0.085796 |  Staying down from that challenge like that.
[649.44 - 651.44] P:1715.89 E:0.093842 |  Do you want to respond to that, Rob?
[651.44 - 653.44] P:1823.04 E:0.114703 |  It's not nice getting out there.
[653.60 - 655.60] P:1756.72 E:0.108748 |  Do you want to respond to that, Rob?
[655.60 - 659.60] P:1804.02 E:0.102082 |  It's not nice getting a dig in the ribs in any sense.
[662.40 - 667.60] P:1800.86 E:0.105904 |  He's alright after a lengthy stoppage here on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[668.96 - 672.88] P:1590.65 E:0.094632 |  Larise clears it long downfield left footed.
[672.88 - 674.88] P:1627.42 E:0.100289 |  Giroud tries to get on the end of it.
[675.44 - 678.48] P:1507.20 E:0.103146 |  Headed away by Talia Fico, the left back for Argentina.
[678.48 - 680.56] P:1477.08 E:0.104417 |  Rabio with a ponytail, heads it forward.
[681.52 - 683.52] P:1728.01 E:0.115342 |  Griswold tries to win it back.
[683.52 - 686.56] P:1615.13 E:0.099709 |  There was DePaul, McAllister turns out towards Di Maria,
[686.56 - 687.92] P:1662.94 E:0.092250 |  far side the left.
[687.92 - 691.68] P:1603.87 E:0.109292 |  Talia Fico plays the ball back and Argentina will go all the way back to there.
[691.68 - 693.68] P:1771.02 E:0.112364 |  Gold keeper, Emi Martinez.
[694.64 - 698.96] P:1705.61 E:0.107933 |  The first Aston Villa player to appear in a World Cup final.
[701.28 - 704.48] P:1738.71 E:0.110120 |  Ball sent forward by Fernandez.
[704.48 - 705.84] P:1738.97 E:0.109458 |  Alvarez will give chase.
[705.84 - 707.84] P:1757.03 E:0.117372 |  Verrante is up towards Larise.
[707.84 - 709.84] P:1854.41 E:0.119455 |  Clears it away first time left footed.
[710.32 - 712.56] P:1843.22 E:0.118193 |  12 minutes played, still goal is here in the sail.
[713.68 - 719.28] P:1698.76 E:0.108839 |  DePaul, Molina not had chance to get forward so far on this right hand side, the right back.
[719.84 - 724.64] P:1788.43 E:0.107168 |  Di Maria controls the ball left hand side, pulls it back, cut out by Tua Menek.
[724.64 - 726.80] P:1766.13 E:0.099266 |  Almost reached Messi, still lay attack.
[726.80 - 730.32] P:1760.12 E:0.103293 |  DePaul messes on the stretch and then cleared away.
[730.32 - 734.72] P:1747.53 E:0.102886 |  Alvarez charges it down from Talia, Hernandez attempted clearance.
[734.72 - 736.32] P:1722.65 E:0.109655 |  That's what he gives you Alvarez.
[736.32 - 741.36] P:1752.34 E:0.101867 |  It's not just his goal threat and his pace, his work rate.
[741.36 - 744.80] P:1587.22 E:0.103447 |  We've seen it in the quarter final and the 75.
[744.80 - 746.08] P:1568.51 E:0.103583 |  He's been brilliant.
[746.72 - 751.20] P:1609.16 E:0.113416 |  Well, the Argentinian team have started with great intensity.
[752.32 - 758.08] P:1541.55 E:0.106827 |  Doesn't give the French defenders the moments peace there and that run just moments before that.
[758.08 - 763.60] P:1619.92 E:0.097871 |  He'll do that all evening, stretch that French back line that allows Messi to come into
[764.56 - 768.64] P:1636.89 E:0.101709 |  those little spaces that are created to get on the ball and do his thing.
[769.52 - 772.00] P:1959.41 E:0.113722 |  Here is Verran midway through his own half.
[772.00 - 774.40] P:2012.84 E:0.113274 |  France are in all maybe playing from right to left.
[774.40 - 776.16] P:2008.92 E:0.113267 |  This is five-liever, it's still 0-0.
[776.80 - 779.76] P:1920.51 E:0.107685 |  Kunde to Dembele, quickly closed down.
[779.76 - 786.48] P:1843.75 E:0.111243 |  Dembele though will wriggle free, plays the ball to Tehanandes.
[786.48 - 789.68] P:1876.38 E:0.114172 |  Now with a Bapé, a Bapé left corner of the area.
[789.68 - 793.20] P:1899.98 E:0.116079 |  First real chance we've had of a Bapé in this game so far to Rabiot.
[793.28 - 796.08] P:1882.96 E:0.114873 |  The return ball and Bapé's pace tries to get in there.
[797.28 - 803.12] P:1840.54 E:0.106476 |  But the anticipation from Eni Martinez, he was quick to accelerate off his line
[803.12 - 806.16] P:1660.05 E:0.081477 |  and he goes down to ground and makes a smothering say.
[806.16 - 808.00] P:1647.43 E:0.091302 |  He's quick, he's not that quick.
[808.00 - 813.68] P:1711.86 E:0.099114 |  Once it gets beyond the defender, he knows he's got that time to come out.
[813.68 - 818.08] P:1790.94 E:0.103109 |  But all of a sudden the intensity of the game just raised once and Bapé got the ball.
[819.20 - 821.44] P:1626.07 E:0.109615 |  At the back, cleared away by Romero.
[822.32 - 825.36] P:1728.83 E:0.091145 |  Alvarez and Messi exchange a couple of headers.
[825.36 - 830.08] P:1752.55 E:0.101624 |  It will run through to McAllister, who quickly sprays it out towards the left.
[830.08 - 835.04] P:1757.99 E:0.108009 |  De Maria is attacking on that far side, coming in field now towards Messi.
[835.04 - 839.04] P:1777.67 E:0.112570 |  Messi on the edge of the area tries to play the return ball towards De Maria.
[839.04 - 842.00] P:1790.72 E:0.100170 |  Coming back from an offside position, sure, yes he was.
[842.00 - 843.68] P:1780.58 E:0.099604 |  And that will be a free kick to France.
[844.88 - 849.68] P:1729.08 E:0.099573 |  Just wondered there, Messi 25 yards out,
[849.68 - 852.80] P:1707.84 E:0.087725 |  whether he was going to get a shot off himself.
[852.80 - 857.12] P:1753.23 E:0.097286 |  But he saw the run of De Maria, unfortunately for Argentina.
[858.16 - 861.20] P:1837.41 E:0.107738 |  Messi just proceeded the pass of all straight to Kunday.
[862.80 - 864.80] P:1773.51 E:0.117373 |  Been playing for nearly a quarter of an hour.
[865.36 - 867.36] P:1707.36 E:0.099110 |  Argentina against France.
[869.36 - 873.52] P:1720.42 E:0.108479 |  The backdrop of 50,000 Argentinians in this World Cup final.
[874.24 - 878.00] P:1719.55 E:0.106044 |  It will sound slightly different on Tuesday night for the first of three
[878.08 - 879.36] P:1654.07 E:0.091467 |  successive nights of league.
[879.36 - 883.60] P:1709.44 E:0.105087 |  They're back to play you on Five Live when we're at MK Don's against Leicester City.
[884.80 - 887.52] P:1672.30 E:0.094207 |  That's for next week as our live football will continue.
[888.40 - 890.72] P:1678.06 E:0.109020 |  Wherever you can go though, always remember,
[890.72 - 893.36] P:1669.92 E:0.105517 |  BBC Sounds is the place to take Five Live with you.
[893.36 - 898.72] P:1728.09 E:0.091539 |  But here we are in Lusseo and it's with Fernandez out towards Molina.
[898.72 - 902.64] P:1776.45 E:0.099664 |  Attack minded right back, who plays it now towards Romero.
[903.36 - 908.56] P:1722.55 E:0.112978 |  Otter Mendi carries the ball over the halfway line out towards De Maria.
[910.08 - 915.36] P:1587.53 E:0.103680 |  Talia Fico. Fernandez left at the centre circle.
[917.04 - 922.24] P:1679.66 E:0.105063 |  Fernandez just linking up the play with the central defenders as Romero takes over.
[922.24 - 927.12] P:1671.02 E:0.104376 |  Indeed Fernandez now drops in between the two central defenders as the pullbacks are pushed off.
[927.68 - 929.60] P:1623.19 E:0.104492 |  And as Talia Fico makes a run in field,
[929.68 - 933.52] P:1660.89 E:0.100970 |  De Maria drops just over the halfway line on that left-hand side.
[933.52 - 937.52] P:1688.18 E:0.103524 |  And at a walking pace, Argentina are controlling this game.
[937.52 - 940.40] P:1788.76 E:0.107099 |  And then Molina tries to make that darting going forward
[940.40 - 943.92] P:1681.87 E:0.103149 |  with the ambitious ball, it's too far ahead of him, and it goes out for a France throw.
[943.92 - 944.48] P:1466.18 E:0.095855 |  Rob Green.
[944.48 - 945.44] P:1750.03 E:0.098450 |  Yeah, it's interesting.
[945.44 - 948.64] P:1634.37 E:0.098904 |  Griezmann's the comfort blanket for France when they haven't got the ball.
[948.64 - 952.16] P:1604.16 E:0.104136 |  When they want to go and press and risk it a little bit, he steps up out the line.
[952.72 - 955.28] P:1764.57 E:0.096102 |  There, they really haven't quite got the game right yet.
[955.28 - 957.36] P:1704.33 E:0.094117 |  They haven't tactically got this right yet.
[957.36 - 961.92] P:1738.62 E:0.097910 |  So he dropped a lot deeper into midfield and said, right, you've got to play around us.
[961.92 - 966.32] P:1790.30 E:0.095002 |  The game slows down, they win the ball back and get a little bit of control again.
[966.32 - 970.64] P:1900.97 E:0.110299 |  When they last met at a World Cup in Kazan four years ago, it was the last 16,
[970.64 - 972.24] P:1865.21 E:0.117140 |  there'd already been a goal at this stage.
[972.88 - 977.04] P:1809.14 E:0.113091 |  It was a Griezmann penalty as the loose ball is picked up by Argentina.
[977.04 - 979.52] P:1852.24 E:0.122463 |  Messi to the ball, pullback towards Messi.
[979.52 - 981.84] P:1791.88 E:0.120743 |  It'll fall to De Maria and he's skied it.
[982.40 - 986.40] P:1743.92 E:0.105789 |  Just inside the penalty area, central position, right footed,
[986.40 - 988.72] P:1796.99 E:0.097881 |  couldn't keep it down, goal kick, no, no.
[988.72 - 992.08] P:1705.90 E:0.105177 |  Once again, sloppy play this time from Amanda, the French left back,
[992.08 - 996.32] P:1672.96 E:0.094756 |  and as the ball is fed in field, Messi picks the ball up and pops it.
[996.96 - 1001.04] P:1718.61 E:0.095610 |  Out to the right-hand side, De Paul feeds across in.
[1001.68 - 1005.28] P:1675.68 E:0.111221 |  De Maria on his weaker right foot, it just bobbles up slightly.
[1005.28 - 1007.36] P:1708.89 E:0.107682 |  Was he 16 yards out centrally?
[1008.08 - 1012.16] P:1666.83 E:0.104824 |  It's a really poor connection well over the bar,
[1012.16 - 1016.48] P:1712.61 E:0.100095 |  but I think Scoloni will be happy with this start from his Argentinian team.
[1017.52 - 1018.80] P:1724.52 E:0.111774 |  He's playing on the wrong side, isn't he?
[1018.80 - 1019.92] P:1718.33 E:0.108523 |  He should have been coming on his left.
[1021.76 - 1024.56] P:1683.58 E:0.107668 |  Rob Green and Chris Sutton with his 17 minutes played,
[1024.56 - 1025.76] P:1789.82 E:0.107304 |  we're still awaiting the goal.
[1025.76 - 1027.44] P:1829.02 E:0.096866 |  Indeed, you were in that game in Kazan, weren't you?
[1027.44 - 1029.84] P:1800.77 E:0.099157 |  And you went trans-one by four goals to three.
[1029.84 - 1033.60] P:1713.48 E:0.094366 |  In the cooking pot in Kazan and took over that Griezmann penalty,
[1033.60 - 1038.64] P:1663.61 E:0.100099 |  it was that game from a run from Mbappe, the length of the field to win the penalty,
[1038.64 - 1041.28] P:1663.90 E:0.100625 |  but he's barely had a kick so far.
[1041.84 - 1045.52] P:1815.20 E:0.102773 |  And the cooking pot in Kazan to the cauldron of noise in Lusail.
[1046.96 - 1052.08] P:1811.79 E:0.099765 |  Here is Mbappe, near side the left for France, back to Hernandez,
[1052.08 - 1057.04] P:1786.60 E:0.096692 |  goes further back to Upper Meccano, goes square across the back now towards Verran.
[1057.76 - 1061.36] P:1791.32 E:0.097810 |  Verran right at the centre circle, approaches the halfway line.
[1062.16 - 1065.04] P:1655.41 E:0.105899 |  Gunde plays it forward, Dembele now links up with Gunde,
[1065.04 - 1067.60] P:1737.14 E:0.113932 |  but the return ball, Dembele will get there with his face.
[1068.56 - 1070.88] P:1873.32 E:0.119850 |  Although the Argentinian support behind that goal
[1070.88 - 1073.76] P:1833.90 E:0.105742 |  thought that it actually got out of play, we're too far away to tell.
[1073.76 - 1075.52] P:1826.83 E:0.102807 |  France have got to throw right hand side.
[1077.44 - 1082.24] P:1771.64 E:0.096596 |  But we've hardly seen much of France as an attacking force in these opening 18 minutes.
[1082.80 - 1086.96] P:1696.71 E:0.095629 |  As Gunde goes back to Verran, almost midway through the Argentinian half.
[1087.60 - 1091.04] P:1865.76 E:0.103399 |  Now with Upper Meccano, to this near side now to Teo Hernandez.
[1092.72 - 1097.04] P:1840.60 E:0.097098 |  Here is Mbappe, flicks the ball forward, Hernandez goes to ground,
[1097.12 - 1098.64] P:1711.15 E:0.112053 |  referee will give the free kick.
[1100.40 - 1102.80] P:1809.35 E:0.102963 |  Free kick to France in a very dangerous position,
[1102.80 - 1105.60] P:1778.98 E:0.092534 |  about six yards up from the byline, left of the penalty area.
[1105.60 - 1108.96] P:1612.32 E:0.084512 |  Yeah, I think he's better going forward than Hernandez, and he is defensively.
[1110.56 - 1114.24] P:1799.09 E:0.106461 |  He just draws the foul from Romero,
[1114.24 - 1117.92] P:1750.61 E:0.093658 |  the right centre half for Argentina, comes out and brings him down.
[1118.72 - 1123.12] P:1720.70 E:0.108480 |  Clever little touch to get past him, and now this is an opportunity
[1124.08 - 1129.44] P:1910.41 E:0.112539 |  for France. Griezmann wanders over, that wander of a left foot.
[1130.40 - 1134.64] P:1960.01 E:0.110899 |  The French tricolours are flying away towards our right,
[1134.64 - 1139.44] P:1812.73 E:0.104417 |  but our eyes are cast to the left, because that's where Griezmann has placed the ball down.
[1140.00 - 1144.24] P:1824.66 E:0.108664 |  Argentina have everybody back inside their own penalty area.
[1145.36 - 1148.72] P:1913.40 E:0.110877 |  It's Griezmann, left foot, it thinks it's towards the far post,
[1148.80 - 1153.68] P:1898.44 E:0.101882 |  and it was Olivier Giroud, who threw himself at that six yards out,
[1154.72 - 1158.16] P:1687.26 E:0.089012 |  and couldn't keep it down, and it will be a goal kick.
[1158.72 - 1163.84] P:1653.16 E:0.099074 |  Free kick awarded anyway. I don't think Giroud does a lot wrong there.
[1164.40 - 1168.32] P:1762.58 E:0.084308 |  It's above his defender. Jumps early, that's the key.
[1168.32 - 1175.60] P:1768.39 E:0.094043 |  We saw the issues that the Argentinian centre halves had with the Dutch, Giroud.
[1175.84 - 1180.56] P:1692.95 E:0.084868 |  A specialist in the air, scores Romero and Otamende,
[1180.56 - 1184.16] P:1569.21 E:0.097763 |  all sorts of problems if he gets the right service.
[1184.16 - 1188.56] P:1729.25 E:0.090393 |  He's become in this tournament the all-time top scorer for France,
[1188.56 - 1194.40] P:1816.73 E:0.093539 |  and he was looking for what actually would have taken him level with Mbappe and Messi
[1194.40 - 1200.00] P:1645.31 E:0.094113 |  on five goals in order to try and maybe win the Golden Boot here in Qatar.
[1200.00 - 1202.80] P:1649.64 E:0.093514 |  20 minutes play, still 0-0.
[1203.12 - 1206.56] P:1602.29 E:0.095963 |  What have you made of the 20-minute drop-green?
[1206.56 - 1209.68] P:1748.54 E:0.098431 |  Well, I think that chance just sums up France, doesn't it?
[1209.68 - 1213.28] P:1772.50 E:0.098675 |  They don't play well, they look like they've got the game together,
[1213.28 - 1219.28] P:1672.23 E:0.091164 |  then all of a sudden they pop up two passes, a good free kick and an opportunity for Giroud.
[1220.24 - 1221.68] P:1651.47 E:0.097750 |  Just how France play.
[1222.32 - 1226.72] P:1756.16 E:0.094719 |  Here is Messi, collecting the ball midway through the France half.
[1227.28 - 1232.16] P:1654.54 E:0.083577 |  Molina is the outlet on the right-hand side, back with De Paul.
[1232.80 - 1234.80] P:1648.03 E:0.104208 |  France have everybody back behind the ball.
[1235.60 - 1237.68] P:1737.29 E:0.108257 |  Now it is with Otamende.
[1239.36 - 1243.92] P:1692.06 E:0.111092 |  Fernandez closed down by Griezmann, Romero inside the centre-circle as it goes back.
[1244.56 - 1246.96] P:1692.14 E:0.111572 |  De Paul on the halfway line, plays it forward.
[1246.96 - 1250.64] P:1793.35 E:0.099981 |  Fernandez is able to turn, runs through towards McAllister,
[1250.64 - 1255.12] P:1798.58 E:0.099931 |  they play it out towards the left, quickly feeding it towards De Maria.
[1255.12 - 1257.52] P:1847.40 E:0.119018 |  De Maria cuts inside, De Maria is done well.
[1257.52 - 1260.56] P:1829.71 E:0.119495 |  De Maria goes down and the referee gives the penalty.
[1260.80 - 1263.44] P:1823.04 E:0.120907 |  They've bundled over from behind.
[1265.12 - 1266.32] P:1749.77 E:0.126333 |  And you know what this means.
[1267.52 - 1272.16] P:1828.26 E:0.116778 |  But little Messi will have the opportunity to give Argentina the lead.
[1275.20 - 1279.84] P:1740.54 E:0.113984 |  It's brilliant play on the byline from De Maria, shapes across the ball in, left-footed,
[1279.84 - 1285.60] P:1785.81 E:0.101739 |  and he drives inside Dembélé, and there is contact from Dembélé.
[1285.60 - 1288.80] P:1716.46 E:0.100229 |  It's a clumsy challenge from him.
[1289.52 - 1293.28] P:1732.84 E:0.108810 |  We know De Maria doesn't need a second invitation to go down.
[1294.96 - 1295.84] P:1716.12 E:0.123284 |  He goes down.
[1297.04 - 1300.40] P:1861.75 E:0.115877 |  It'll be checked by Thomas Wietkowski, the Polish VAR.
[1302.40 - 1306.80] P:1783.13 E:0.112826 |  Well, it won't get overturned because he's got the wrong side of him and he makes contact.
[1306.80 - 1309.76] P:1767.28 E:0.111486 |  It's so, so soft from a France point of view.
[1309.76 - 1314.32] P:1733.87 E:0.103544 |  Dembélé sells himself out wide and then just makes the faintest of contact.
[1314.96 - 1318.40] P:1755.04 E:0.109813 |  De Maria looked up, knew that there was no options in the penalty area,
[1318.40 - 1320.80] P:1725.94 E:0.097177 |  and was like, please, just make contact.
[1320.80 - 1322.88] P:1828.42 E:0.109353 |  I'm going to go down and he duly applies.
[1325.12 - 1327.36] P:1755.08 E:0.119556 |  Little Messi's already scored three penalties.
[1328.08 - 1334.08] P:1818.82 E:0.107845 |  He did, of course, miss against Poland, but he's only missed on four occasions
[1336.00 - 1339.36] P:1786.85 E:0.110562 |  in his international career out of 28 attempts.
[1340.32 - 1346.08] P:1792.13 E:0.109561 |  Lionel Messi to what would be his sixth goal of this tournament.
[1346.72 - 1349.60] P:1840.31 E:0.119711 |  Runs up now, left-footed, and scores.
[1351.60 - 1353.52] P:1786.56 E:0.125400 |  The little man for the big occasion.
[1355.36 - 1359.60] P:1769.14 E:0.124207 |  And Lionel Messi is absolutely swamped by his teammates.
[1361.84 - 1365.84] P:1689.45 E:0.123523 |  We all know what the missing piece is in his illustrious career,
[1366.72 - 1368.64] P:1726.31 E:0.124499 |  and he has got the breakthrough goal.
[1370.08 - 1374.32] P:1673.44 E:0.116338 |  And Argentina lead France by a goal to nil.
[1374.32 - 1376.64] P:1713.80 E:0.115554 |  He was never going to miss. One nil.
[1377.44 - 1378.72] P:1710.51 E:0.120999 |  Listen to this noise.
[1379.52 - 1381.28] P:1646.68 E:0.120313 |  You're right, he was never going to miss.
[1382.96 - 1385.68] P:1736.57 E:0.119836 |  Just slows his run up down a little bit.
[1385.68 - 1392.56] P:1749.47 E:0.110872 |  Larisse goes to his right-hand side with Messi is watching him all the way,
[1393.12 - 1394.96] P:1753.83 E:0.115021 |  just tops it in the other corner.
[1396.24 - 1399.28] P:1729.71 E:0.119952 |  Cool as you like, the coolest man inside the stadium.
[1401.12 - 1402.80] P:1689.55 E:0.125131 |  Great start for Argentina.
[1403.92 - 1405.76] P:1650.02 E:0.112508 |  We have work to do.
[1405.76 - 1407.84] P:1826.13 E:0.115695 |  We are midway through the first half.
[1407.84 - 1411.44] P:1747.05 E:0.112954 |  You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.
[1412.00 - 1415.76] P:1685.08 E:0.105702 |  And to take you through the halftime, here's that correspondent John Murray.
[1416.40 - 1417.28] P:1587.43 E:0.113504 |  Well, thanks, Ian.
[1417.84 - 1422.72] P:1572.26 E:0.101792 |  And Lionel Messi now crosses the halfway line,
[1423.44 - 1426.32] P:1747.48 E:0.106097 |  having just scored in a World Cup final.
[1427.28 - 1431.12] P:1653.55 E:0.104888 |  He's just done something that Diego Maradona did not do.
[1432.08 - 1435.84] P:1705.17 E:0.108763 |  And as you walk back from the celebrations,
[1435.84 - 1439.12] P:1781.82 E:0.104449 |  the frenzied celebrations down close to the corner flag,
[1440.24 - 1443.12] P:1793.64 E:0.108828 |  he just raised his fist and punched the air.
[1444.08 - 1447.36] P:1832.49 E:0.101410 |  And Argentina have the edge over France.
[1449.60 - 1451.68] P:1782.35 E:0.107373 |  Argentina on the back foot now,
[1451.68 - 1455.52] P:1788.98 E:0.113066 |  but the noise inside the Luce El Stadium here, all around us.
[1455.52 - 1458.88] P:1797.70 E:0.099230 |  Yes, and Bapes slips the ball into the penalty area,
[1458.88 - 1460.72] P:1777.30 E:0.099394 |  but he doesn't find a teammate.
[1460.72 - 1464.32] P:1722.02 E:0.111874 |  And now Argentina break again, Alvarez,
[1464.32 - 1468.32] P:1700.34 E:0.094813 |  and then a back heel flick from McAllister knocks it back down into the left-back position,
[1468.32 - 1470.72] P:1758.02 E:0.110882 |  where Talia Fico plays it out of play.
[1470.72 - 1474.40] P:1762.69 E:0.108741 |  Off the man who conceded the penalty, Dempale.
[1475.92 - 1481.92] P:1740.47 E:0.100450 |  So Lionel Messi scores his 97th international goal.
[1482.80 - 1487.28] P:1739.16 E:0.101136 |  And that is his 12th at World Cups,
[1487.28 - 1493.52] P:1732.65 E:0.108783 |  which means that he now moves alongside Pelle in terms of the total number of goals scored
[1493.52 - 1495.28] P:1733.43 E:0.100280 |  at World Cup finals tournaments.
[1496.16 - 1500.16] P:1622.74 E:0.100855 |  Everything he does, there is a milestone attached to it,
[1500.16 - 1503.60] P:1642.65 E:0.100743 |  but what he really wants is that golden trophy in his hands.
[1504.24 - 1508.16] P:1634.97 E:0.097866 |  And with that penalty, he's put Argentina in full position.
[1508.16 - 1510.72] P:1730.80 E:0.096978 |  Rob Green, well, the way that they've started,
[1510.72 - 1514.64] P:1752.06 E:0.090389 |  and how poor France have been really sitting in this open course of the game,
[1514.64 - 1516.16] P:1668.24 E:0.105567 |  there's an opportunity for more,
[1516.16 - 1520.64] P:1783.26 E:0.096851 |  we saw against Croatia that they almost ran away with the game once they crowd got up,
[1520.64 - 1523.44] P:1686.36 E:0.090450 |  once they got lifted, Croatia couldn't respond.
[1523.44 - 1526.08] P:1764.49 E:0.104822 |  France have got to up it now because this could run away.
[1526.88 - 1529.04] P:1681.04 E:0.098813 |  They've been the better team, now they have the lead.
[1529.52 - 1534.08] P:1759.21 E:0.095841 |  Argentina looking to win the World Cup for the first time since 1986.
[1534.64 - 1536.96] P:1759.86 E:0.108518 |  And France though winning the ball back, here's Giroux,
[1536.96 - 1539.20] P:1785.61 E:0.095554 |  but Giroux quite strongly challenged.
[1539.20 - 1544.00] P:1865.70 E:0.090515 |  He was by the Argentine defender, came in at pace.
[1544.00 - 1547.60] P:1854.47 E:0.088530 |  Giroux went down Chris Sutton, France have a free kick and a good position.
[1547.60 - 1551.36] P:1731.58 E:0.099129 |  Yes, about what? 30 yards out, Ramero, strong challenge.
[1552.24 - 1554.08] P:1589.92 E:0.096454 |  Into the back of Giroux.
[1554.08 - 1556.88] P:1743.69 E:0.097487 |  I mean, what the Argentinian goal might do,
[1557.04 - 1560.72] P:1747.96 E:0.102602 |  should do, you think, is liven this French team up a little bit.
[1561.60 - 1567.12] P:1687.36 E:0.103993 |  They have been way off the pace this opening, 25, 26 minutes.
[1569.20 - 1572.00] P:1776.86 E:0.108713 |  Well, it is a free kick after Ramero's challenge,
[1572.00 - 1576.88] P:1799.64 E:0.104827 |  so that was Tottenham on the former Arsenal Chelsea man Giroux free kick.
[1576.88 - 1579.20] P:1900.62 E:0.105425 |  Griezmann's going to take it, but referee Marciniac says,
[1579.20 - 1581.68] P:1739.35 E:0.097384 |  hang on a minute, hang on, blows his whistle because
[1582.72 - 1585.36] P:1847.15 E:0.103337 |  there's been a collision on the edge of the box.
[1585.36 - 1589.52] P:1860.31 E:0.097785 |  Giroux is trying to help up the player who went down,
[1589.52 - 1591.12] P:1844.53 E:0.099019 |  who is Enzo Fernandez.
[1591.12 - 1595.52] P:1943.73 E:0.092375 |  And Enzo Fernandez wasn't for the hand of friendship there, Chris,
[1595.52 - 1598.72] P:1832.83 E:0.100476 |  as it was offered by Giroux very gallantly.
[1600.72 - 1602.96] P:1622.66 E:0.109215 |  Well, there's not going to be too many hands of friendship,
[1602.96 - 1604.48] P:1690.43 E:0.090212 |  it's coming together.
[1604.48 - 1609.76] P:1754.94 E:0.098038 |  Giroux catches Fernandez who stooped down, Giroux catches him with his forearm.
[1610.32 - 1611.68] P:1813.99 E:0.107309 |  And he's still at him Giroux.
[1611.68 - 1614.48] P:1821.39 E:0.108484 |  Now, as Griezmann will take it, left footed into the penalty area,
[1614.48 - 1616.24] P:1837.22 E:0.105571 |  but that's effectively headed away.
[1616.24 - 1618.48] P:1799.76 E:0.113816 |  Then nodded back over the top by Theo Hernandez.
[1619.04 - 1623.28] P:1870.92 E:0.109736 |  He was caught late, I think in fact he's a judge to have committed the foul.
[1623.28 - 1625.92] P:1827.49 E:0.108808 |  Theo Hernandez, and it's the Argentine players down,
[1625.92 - 1630.40] P:1809.36 E:0.104583 |  and the referee's immediately called for the medical people to come on
[1630.40 - 1631.76] P:1802.43 E:0.099917 |  because it was a clash of heads.
[1632.56 - 1634.48] P:1744.27 E:0.105433 |  Between, well, Messi, it's not a clash of heads,
[1634.48 - 1636.48] P:1672.99 E:0.106735 |  he's been caught on the side of his shoulder, I would say.
[1637.60 - 1640.32] P:1707.93 E:0.103363 |  So, and that is guilty of winning a header.
[1640.32 - 1642.32] P:1753.02 E:0.112440 |  And that's it, it's an incredible decision.
[1642.88 - 1646.08] P:1814.95 E:0.102371 |  I would take a punt that if that wasn't Messi going down,
[1646.08 - 1649.28] P:1740.76 E:0.105204 |  the referee wouldn't have given a free kick to Argentine.
[1649.28 - 1653.44] P:1709.24 E:0.109462 |  And what a position the free kick would have been in for France.
[1654.56 - 1658.08] P:1595.39 E:0.108728 |  But you can't give free kicks against Lionel Messi.
[1661.12 - 1662.80] P:1735.31 E:0.112197 |  Free kick given to Argentina.
[1662.80 - 1667.28] P:1771.91 E:0.102232 |  Argentina lead France by Juan Goultonel in this FIFA World Cup final,
[1667.84 - 1672.00] P:1723.59 E:0.107290 |  here in Doha, on actually what feels like quite a cool
[1672.00 - 1675.76] P:1689.99 E:0.112264 |  evening. And it feels like there's a breeze blowing around the ground.
[1675.76 - 1678.56] P:1727.84 E:0.100931 |  But that's the air conditioning inside this stadium.
[1678.56 - 1680.56] P:1828.32 E:0.103923 |  It's actually a very pleasant evening outside.
[1680.56 - 1683.28] P:1759.46 E:0.098844 |  I'm not even sure they would necessarily need to have switched it on.
[1683.84 - 1686.64] P:1818.42 E:0.101584 |  But the temperatures are cool inside.
[1686.64 - 1689.28] P:1746.45 E:0.102978 |  But this World Cup final is warming up.
[1689.28 - 1693.84] P:1793.33 E:0.092957 |  And certainly that moment, that Lionel Messi goal-scoring moment.
[1694.56 - 1696.48] P:1778.69 E:0.093367 |  Even though it's from the penalty spot,
[1696.48 - 1700.16] P:1803.01 E:0.103346 |  that's what all of these Argentina fans were dreaming of when they came here.
[1700.24 - 1701.84] P:1738.15 E:0.120521 |  Hugo Lloris set the wrong way, Rob.
[1702.48 - 1704.56] P:1801.99 E:0.105898 |  Yep, it's an awful one for a goalkeeper.
[1704.56 - 1707.04] P:1814.42 E:0.099631 |  Just the pause, the weight and the look.
[1707.04 - 1708.96] P:1861.31 E:0.108005 |  And you know as soon as he looks at you,
[1709.52 - 1712.40] P:1728.61 E:0.104485 |  any ink in, any flinch, he's going the other way.
[1712.40 - 1714.40] P:1757.68 E:0.110210 |  Here he is now, Messi down the right-hand side.
[1714.40 - 1718.00] P:1832.77 E:0.114255 |  But in comes the challenge from Teo Hernandez to block it behind for
[1719.12 - 1720.64] P:1770.12 E:0.113736 |  another corner to Argentina.
[1720.64 - 1721.84] P:1792.35 E:0.108895 |  Almost half an hour play.
[1721.84 - 1725.52] P:1706.11 E:0.099736 |  This is five-live from the BBC.
[1727.12 - 1729.36] P:1565.92 E:0.111021 |  Listeners well via BBC sounds.
[1729.44 - 1733.52] P:1730.56 E:0.108859 |  There's still time to take the World Cup with you on BBC sounds.
[1733.52 - 1736.80] P:1776.37 E:0.110726 |  And we're also across Africa on the World Service.
[1737.36 - 1738.32] P:1580.33 E:0.118549 |  And it is a corner.
[1739.36 - 1741.60] P:1676.61 E:0.117424 |  Lionel Messi way down in the corner.
[1741.60 - 1742.80] P:1698.43 E:0.114277 |  A little bearded figure.
[1744.00 - 1746.80] P:1627.77 E:0.112548 |  Those shorts that come right down to his knees,
[1746.80 - 1748.96] P:1610.56 E:0.115176 |  left it into the near post and it's headed away.
[1748.96 - 1751.84] P:1699.90 E:0.101011 |  Jiru actually in between two Argentinians.
[1751.84 - 1757.12] P:1730.09 E:0.095123 |  And then the offside flag is up as Messi takes the ball under control.
[1757.20 - 1759.76] P:1658.29 E:0.093657 |  And it's a free kick to France in their own left-back position.
[1759.76 - 1760.72] P:1574.47 E:0.113797 |  Argentina won.
[1761.28 - 1762.24] P:1719.72 E:0.089832 |  France, Nile.
[1762.24 - 1762.96] P:1689.44 E:0.090648 |  Chris Sutton.
[1762.96 - 1765.60] P:1607.36 E:0.105310 |  Yes, really good defending from Jiru.
[1765.60 - 1767.68] P:1707.51 E:0.094796 |  Good ball in from Messi.
[1767.68 - 1768.80] P:1697.61 E:0.113705 |  They put it in, swing up.
[1769.76 - 1772.40] P:1606.02 E:0.114593 |  Jiru good in the air in both boxes.
[1774.72 - 1776.48] P:1690.36 E:0.126271 |  So it is a free kick for France.
[1777.12 - 1780.48] P:1814.96 E:0.116582 |  Lionel Messi incidentally as well becomes the first man to score
[1780.48 - 1785.44] P:1664.29 E:0.105018 |  in a World Cup final for Argentina since 1986.
[1785.44 - 1786.72] P:1652.46 E:0.104439 |  Since they last won it.
[1787.44 - 1790.80] P:1701.55 E:0.108753 |  The last goal was scored by Jorge Borrechaaga
[1791.36 - 1797.04] P:1806.06 E:0.104590 |  who scored the third goal when they won 3-2 against the then West Germany.
[1797.04 - 1799.04] P:1587.42 E:0.101369 |  That was Diego Maradona's team as I say.
[1799.04 - 1800.40] P:1785.29 E:0.102175 |  He didn't score in that final.
[1800.40 - 1803.52] P:1738.37 E:0.094898 |  It was Lota Mateos who was looking after him.
[1803.52 - 1806.72] P:1738.89 E:0.106302 |  All of his teammates stepped up and Argentina won it.
[1806.72 - 1807.92] P:1686.97 E:0.097054 |  And they're winning this one.
[1807.92 - 1809.92] P:1773.26 E:0.110607 |  And he has Di Maria with the cross from the left hand side
[1809.92 - 1811.60] P:1797.12 E:0.111208 |  but it's good for the two on that.
[1811.60 - 1814.32] P:1820.31 E:0.112777 |  And it's out of play for a throwing in the left-back position.
[1814.32 - 1816.32] P:1780.57 E:0.107043 |  That was the wild card selection.
[1816.32 - 1819.12] P:1673.63 E:0.101979 |  If you want to call it that from Lionel Scaloni.
[1820.32 - 1823.76] P:1734.49 E:0.104053 |  See Di Maria over there put his hands on his head in anguish.
[1823.76 - 1826.80] P:1689.95 E:0.105597 |  But he brought him in to start and he started him on the left hand side
[1826.80 - 1827.76] P:1621.97 E:0.106267 |  and Messi on the right.
[1827.76 - 1832.80] P:1721.60 E:0.108079 |  Yeah and he's a full ball in but what it does do is make the pitch a lot bigger
[1832.80 - 1833.76] P:1789.73 E:0.106017 |  for Argentina.
[1833.76 - 1834.80] P:1582.50 E:0.120349 |  Him holding out wide.
[1835.44 - 1837.60] P:1646.39 E:0.107091 |  Then they've got the options to find other players.
[1837.60 - 1839.68] P:1811.88 E:0.099354 |  And France haven't come up with an answer yet.
[1840.32 - 1840.96] P:1594.10 E:0.101831 |  No they haven't.
[1841.60 - 1846.00] P:1684.98 E:0.101799 |  And it is Argentina in the famous blue and white striped
[1846.00 - 1848.96] P:1654.32 E:0.099550 |  shirts, white shorts, white socks who have the ball
[1848.96 - 1850.56] P:1578.50 E:0.092272 |  and it's played back into central defence.
[1851.20 - 1853.20] P:1425.69 E:0.110230 |  And Otomendi and Romero are there.
[1853.20 - 1856.16] P:1596.36 E:0.092718 |  Nicholas Otomendi the former Manchester City man tonight.
[1856.16 - 1860.00] P:1681.61 E:0.098475 |  Incidentally winning his 100th cap in the World Cup final.
[1860.64 - 1862.32] P:1720.54 E:0.091543 |  Doesn't get much better than that.
[1862.32 - 1864.48] P:1835.39 E:0.102009 |  Particularly if you go on to win it.
[1864.48 - 1865.84] P:1764.41 E:0.099447 |  And they are one nil up.
[1865.84 - 1867.84] P:1742.75 E:0.105797 |  And here is DePaul on the right hand side.
[1867.84 - 1870.00] P:1806.02 E:0.107533 |  The joker in the pack they call it.
[1870.00 - 1871.36] P:1877.11 E:0.112620 |  Plays it back to Messi.
[1871.36 - 1872.72] P:1774.60 E:0.108651 |  Messi now through the middle.
[1872.72 - 1874.00] P:1810.22 E:0.097772 |  Alvarez is there.
[1874.00 - 1874.72] P:1793.48 E:0.092814 |  Back to Messi.
[1874.72 - 1876.16] P:1600.87 E:0.101350 |  This is middle of the heart.
[1876.16 - 1878.32] P:1769.46 E:0.103436 |  Messi turns away from Griezmann.
[1878.32 - 1880.80] P:1735.69 E:0.103995 |  And now with his right foot, clips the ball out.
[1880.80 - 1882.48] P:1806.96 E:0.107050 |  DeMaria is going to do well to reach that.
[1883.28 - 1884.64] P:1794.47 E:0.097371 |  The ball bounced up.
[1884.64 - 1887.60] P:1816.27 E:0.107050 |  The assistant says he did manage to get under control
[1887.60 - 1889.28] P:1730.60 E:0.099507 |  before it bounced over the line.
[1889.28 - 1890.48] P:1742.49 E:0.091515 |  Back it comes to McAllister.
[1890.48 - 1893.04] P:1619.68 E:0.098163 |  The Brighton man's made a very good start to this game.
[1893.04 - 1893.92] P:1718.06 E:0.086238 |  I must say it.
[1893.92 - 1895.36] P:1655.54 E:0.099029 |  Here he is again on the left hand side.
[1895.36 - 1899.84] P:1671.36 E:0.094569 |  The first Brighton and Hall-Valbyan player to play in a World Cup final.
[1899.84 - 1902.40] P:1818.34 E:0.112221 |  And it's come back to him but he rather snatched at the shot.
[1902.40 - 1904.24] P:1786.03 E:0.112668 |  And it's bounced out of play way over here.
[1904.72 - 1906.56] P:1745.40 E:0.110376 |  On the right hand side for a throw in to France.
[1906.56 - 1907.28] P:1692.47 E:0.116452 |  Chris Sutton.
[1907.28 - 1908.88] P:1646.68 E:0.105247 |  Bit of a commentator's curse there.
[1908.88 - 1910.48] P:1615.48 E:0.097563 |  John Haslubal came back to him.
[1910.48 - 1911.76] P:1653.47 E:0.111139 |  25 yards out.
[1911.76 - 1912.96] P:1656.34 E:0.094965 |  Left hand side of the box.
[1913.60 - 1918.00] P:1678.60 E:0.102394 |  Slashes the ball out wildly for a throw in on the far side of the pitch.
[1918.00 - 1920.24] P:1736.64 E:0.096713 |  We're all guilty of that.
[1920.24 - 1921.44] P:1619.19 E:0.106392 |  But one time or another.
[1922.00 - 1926.08] P:1750.11 E:0.098215 |  As you may know, Chris by the way will be hosting 606 tonight.
[1926.08 - 1930.00] P:1779.70 E:0.091354 |  A Doha Sulford edition of 606.
[1930.00 - 1932.08] P:1695.93 E:0.089399 |  Robbie Sandwich and Chris Sutton taking it calls.
[1932.08 - 1932.88] P:1661.42 E:0.094756 |  He has Messi.
[1932.88 - 1934.40] P:1746.44 E:0.109552 |  Messi now just outside the area.
[1934.40 - 1935.52] P:1772.27 E:0.098697 |  Moving from right to left.
[1935.52 - 1938.08] P:1698.12 E:0.105358 |  Upa Mercano went with him and put in the challenge.
[1938.08 - 1939.12] P:1698.50 E:0.095019 |  Went to ground.
[1939.12 - 1939.92] P:1697.18 E:0.091395 |  He had to make it.
[1939.92 - 1940.56] P:1570.55 E:0.088480 |  He did.
[1940.56 - 1942.48] P:1664.00 E:0.094349 |  Could tackle from Upa Mercano.
[1942.48 - 1945.36] P:1674.78 E:0.085344 |  Now it's back with Argentina again.
[1945.36 - 1946.72] P:1686.47 E:0.096855 |  DePaul on the right hand side.
[1946.72 - 1948.08] P:1689.11 E:0.099857 |  Right foot across to the back post.
[1948.08 - 1950.88] P:1654.91 E:0.097743 |  Kunde heads that out to the edge of the area in Dempale.
[1950.88 - 1952.72] P:1825.13 E:0.119178 |  Is able to flick it further away.
[1952.72 - 1954.48] P:1881.23 E:0.106070 |  France just can't get out.
[1955.36 - 1957.68] P:1605.83 E:0.106063 |  And Argentina having taken the lead.
[1958.48 - 1961.20] P:1737.63 E:0.106755 |  They are right on top.
[1961.28 - 1965.44] P:1794.84 E:0.111227 |  They've not taken the foot off the accelerator pedal since they took the lead.
[1965.44 - 1967.52] P:1754.61 E:0.114355 |  Here's McCullis for a game they'll have you touch with him.
[1967.52 - 1969.04] P:1841.65 E:0.112246 |  And the pressure from Choumény.
[1969.04 - 1970.64] P:1826.06 E:0.109394 |  And it's out for a throw in for France.
[1970.64 - 1975.76] P:1791.65 E:0.098421 |  Yeah, McCullis has had a really good start to this game.
[1975.76 - 1977.20] P:1467.82 E:0.098650 |  Making some good forward runs.
[1978.00 - 1982.80] P:1643.52 E:0.096814 |  They're on that inside left with Maria just hanging out on the touch line.
[1982.80 - 1983.92] P:1709.62 E:0.104291 |  And causing problems.
[1983.92 - 1987.84] P:1726.45 E:0.091399 |  All the talk before the game about Messi, Vy and Bapay.
[1987.84 - 1989.20] P:1476.13 E:0.103321 |  Bapay's barely touched the ball.
[1989.44 - 1997.44] P:1718.27 E:0.103262 |  Yeah, it's just seen really the only odd glimpse of what Kille and Bapay might be able to do.
[1998.64 - 2004.40] P:1785.33 E:0.103635 |  If it was a contest between Messi and Bapay, then it is Messi who's winning that one.
[2005.52 - 2007.12] P:1908.77 E:0.119765 |  France have got it all to do.
[2007.12 - 2010.96] P:1834.17 E:0.103203 |  They just, moments, they're just smashing the ball anywhere.
[2010.96 - 2012.96] P:1761.75 E:0.102143 |  There's no control in there moments ago.
[2013.68 - 2015.44] P:1652.81 E:0.104373 |  They had that throwing in their own half.
[2015.44 - 2018.48] P:1772.03 E:0.095087 |  And within two passes, Messi was taking a shot on goal.
[2018.56 - 2020.08] P:1664.35 E:0.091043 |  And it's just from their own throwing.
[2020.08 - 2022.40] P:1592.74 E:0.092461 |  It's basic stuff for France at the moment.
[2023.28 - 2024.96] P:1627.57 E:0.103541 |  They just can't get it right.
[2026.08 - 2029.04] P:1825.14 E:0.112906 |  They're looking around Choumény, doesn't know where he should be playing.
[2029.04 - 2031.44] P:1789.50 E:0.108872 |  Griezmann's having to drop in to help him out.
[2031.44 - 2033.84] P:1753.47 E:0.109609 |  And in turn, they just can't get out their own half.
[2033.84 - 2039.12] P:1743.00 E:0.103918 |  Argentina won France nil with just over 10 minutes to go to halftime.
[2039.76 - 2041.68] P:1662.07 E:0.108461 |  And it is Argentina with the ball.
[2042.24 - 2047.28] P:1737.07 E:0.101470 |  Here is DuPaule with those socks disappearing around his calves.
[2047.28 - 2049.92] P:1703.16 E:0.106335 |  Back in the central defence, the men DuPaule takes it again.
[2049.92 - 2053.28] P:1657.84 E:0.112794 |  He's got no one in a deep blue shirt anywhere near him.
[2053.28 - 2055.20] P:1759.69 E:0.097359 |  So he gives it to Messi to his right.
[2055.20 - 2056.24] P:1751.06 E:0.089931 |  Why wouldn't you?
[2056.24 - 2061.04] P:1693.64 E:0.102134 |  Messi clips it left footed right across field to Di Maria with those two wristbands on.
[2061.04 - 2063.36] P:1666.94 E:0.105789 |  Di Maria now back to Messi just outside the area.
[2063.36 - 2069.12] P:1569.47 E:0.089780 |  Rabiot put in the challenge and that men bounced away back towards Fernandez.
[2069.12 - 2070.40] P:1600.15 E:0.106527 |  Closer to the halfway line.
[2070.40 - 2072.32] P:1627.88 E:0.085961 |  Fernandez receives it again.
[2072.32 - 2075.12] P:1506.03 E:0.091112 |  Benfica man, another hot property.
[2075.20 - 2077.44] P:1630.54 E:0.099208 |  Benfica who made this undeaten start of the season.
[2077.44 - 2078.96] P:1494.78 E:0.102680 |  That's where Autumn Endi is playing now.
[2079.60 - 2082.24] P:1569.45 E:0.106139 |  So two Benfica players in this Argentine side.
[2082.24 - 2084.24] P:1698.00 E:0.104270 |  And it goes back into the centre circle.
[2084.24 - 2087.12] P:1623.16 E:0.097069 |  Argentina dominating possession as well as everything else.
[2087.12 - 2090.00] P:1723.88 E:0.107640 |  And actually it goes all the way back to the Aston Villa man, Martinez,
[2090.00 - 2092.24] P:1722.60 E:0.101422 |  who's barely been tested yet.
[2092.96 - 2096.08] P:1632.25 E:0.101343 |  And they're knocking the ball around with some confidence.
[2096.08 - 2096.80] P:1672.35 E:0.106109 |  Argentina.
[2097.60 - 2100.24] P:1794.80 E:0.101320 |  It looked so comfortable and they got space.
[2100.24 - 2100.80] P:1755.32 E:0.083260 |  They got...
[2100.80 - 2102.56] P:1950.91 E:0.118209 |  Well, John, you've done it again.
[2102.56 - 2103.36] P:1732.62 E:0.105825 |  Uh-huh. Yes.
[2104.08 - 2104.64] P:1797.55 E:0.094085 |  Yes.
[2104.64 - 2108.00] P:1663.67 E:0.105624 |  As the ball was played to the right hand side to Molina with some pace.
[2108.00 - 2112.08] P:1815.86 E:0.106143 |  Now Mbappe takes on the right side to defender Romero.
[2112.08 - 2115.76] P:1813.00 E:0.104487 |  Went past him but the cover was there and Argentina were able to clear it.
[2115.76 - 2119.36] P:1812.70 E:0.102931 |  Scaloni urging his team on from the edge of the coaching area.
[2119.36 - 2122.96] P:1762.02 E:0.110432 |  So up on McCona put in the challenge but Argentina running rings around.
[2122.96 - 2126.64] P:1867.01 E:0.109046 |  France and Alvarez plays it forward and McAllister hits it across.
[2126.64 - 2128.08] P:1868.30 E:0.116735 |  And Di Maria is there!
[2130.24 - 2131.68] P:1915.71 E:0.125330 |  Two-nil Argentina!
[2133.36 - 2139.68] P:1750.70 E:0.112995 |  France lost it on the halfway line and Argentina were absolutely ruthless.
[2139.68 - 2142.88] P:1712.71 E:0.112199 |  And it's Di Maria, the man for the big occasion.
[2143.52 - 2146.24] P:1705.16 E:0.111777 |  The man Scaloni brought back in for the final.
[2148.00 - 2152.32] P:1710.77 E:0.118851 |  Who gives his team a two-nil lead before halftime.
[2153.28 - 2154.32] P:1708.62 E:0.116292 |  Argentina too.
[2155.12 - 2156.48] P:1784.46 E:0.116522 |  The holders, France, Niel.
[2157.36 - 2159.36] P:1783.10 E:0.109467 |  Absolutely ruthless.
[2159.36 - 2160.40] P:1842.43 E:0.119027 |  Argentina there.
[2161.28 - 2162.40] P:1732.12 E:0.085930 |  There was a ball.
[2163.20 - 2165.76] P:1845.80 E:0.095582 |  Helped onto Messi and two quick touches.
[2165.76 - 2168.40] P:1777.18 E:0.108018 |  Fixed the ball up left footed outside of the left boot.
[2168.40 - 2170.72] P:1835.10 E:0.092541 |  And then McAllister's away.
[2171.52 - 2172.88] P:1850.31 E:0.083929 |  Makes a forward run.
[2172.88 - 2177.36] P:1818.43 E:0.100480 |  And on the right hand side of the box could have taken a shot on himself.
[2177.36 - 2184.48] P:1776.19 E:0.101838 |  But had the awareness, had the composure to find Di Maria and waits the ball perfectly.
[2184.48 - 2189.60] P:1676.17 E:0.104895 |  It allows Di Maria to just move onto the ball seamlessly.
[2190.24 - 2194.32] P:1722.82 E:0.100259 |  And he actually, I think he chokes the ball down into the floor over Larisse.
[2194.32 - 2196.00] P:1875.67 E:0.112288 |  Maybe gets a little bit lucky.
[2196.00 - 2199.52] P:1773.87 E:0.102005 |  Otherwise that's absolutely genius from Di Maria.
[2200.16 - 2203.52] P:1743.01 E:0.105772 |  But Argentina are blowing this French team away.
[2204.56 - 2205.36] P:1859.81 E:0.081841 |  It's brilliant.
[2205.36 - 2207.68] P:1844.82 E:0.100759 |  Counter-attack in one touch, football.
[2207.68 - 2209.52] P:1790.95 E:0.102137 |  And it is a brilliant finish.
[2209.52 - 2216.80] P:1821.84 E:0.100680 |  It's Neza Urzalesc playing back in the Arsenal days where he deliberately bumps it into the ground and over Larisse.
[2216.88 - 2221.52] P:1651.15 E:0.108878 |  Complete wave of blue and white to our left in front of us.
[2221.52 - 2222.40] P:1904.63 E:0.101127 |  Just went up.
[2223.44 - 2225.44] P:1798.56 E:0.099959 |  That's the comfort that they needed.
[2225.44 - 2227.92] P:1859.71 E:0.111473 |  That's the one that they deserve from this first half.
[2227.92 - 2236.80] P:1770.81 E:0.104080 |  Because France have not thrown a punch to Nill to Argentina in the 2022 World Cup final.
[2236.80 - 2241.68] P:1767.55 E:0.100855 |  And all of these Argentine supporters who've come here in their thousands.
[2242.00 - 2248.56] P:1630.85 E:0.096377 |  They reckon 50,000 Argentina fans are here in Doha, in Qatar to witness this.
[2248.56 - 2254.16] P:1666.21 E:0.097801 |  What they hope would be their first World Cup triumph since 1986.
[2254.16 - 2258.16] P:1725.11 E:0.097999 |  And with this scoreline, it looks very possible that it will be.
[2258.16 - 2261.20] P:1753.67 E:0.094021 |  The holders have got an awful lot to do from here.
[2261.20 - 2267.12] P:1737.18 E:0.098595 |  Well, I'm baffled by Deschamps that it's 37 minutes into the game and he's not changed it.
[2267.12 - 2268.16] P:1728.14 E:0.114411 |  We're set up here.
[2268.16 - 2269.36] P:1742.06 E:0.101816 |  Everyone can see it.
[2269.36 - 2270.56] P:1750.07 E:0.105825 |  It's just not working.
[2270.56 - 2272.08] P:1642.94 E:0.101260 |  What they're doing isn't working.
[2272.08 - 2273.36] P:1704.11 E:0.106019 |  It needs to change.
[2273.36 - 2275.52] P:1708.66 E:0.103863 |  They're sleeping, walking their way to defeat.
[2275.52 - 2277.28] P:1662.55 E:0.108873 |  They could have already lost it by now.
[2277.28 - 2279.36] P:1766.27 E:0.115062 |  And what a scene we have.
[2279.36 - 2286.88] P:1635.22 E:0.096567 |  Down to our left behind the goal that Ami Martinez is defending.
[2286.88 - 2288.40] P:1691.70 E:0.096929 |  What a scene.
[2288.40 - 2291.52] P:1593.72 E:0.089119 |  Blue and white of Argentina.
[2291.52 - 2293.60] P:1695.92 E:0.100538 |  So many of them on their feet.
[2293.60 - 2295.60] P:1632.97 E:0.092280 |  They couldn't sit down for this.
[2296.56 - 2298.56] P:1685.73 E:0.090593 |  They couldn't sit down for this.
[2298.56 - 2299.84] P:1737.45 E:0.096144 |  And they are singing.
[2299.84 - 2300.56] P:1798.64 E:0.101667 |  They're cheering.
[2300.56 - 2302.16] P:1652.98 E:0.086231 |  They're waving their flags.
[2302.16 - 2306.56] P:1748.69 E:0.095328 |  And at the front of that section as well, so many blue and white Argentina flags
[2306.56 - 2310.80] P:1781.48 E:0.097206 |  and so many images of the face as well of Diego Maradona.
[2310.80 - 2314.40] P:1805.29 E:0.105778 |  And now the ball is played up for France, but in steps from Aero.
[2314.40 - 2316.48] P:1810.85 E:0.102351 |  And Argentina will come forward again.
[2316.48 - 2317.76] P:1852.90 E:0.099007 |  And it's played for Messi.
[2317.76 - 2322.16] P:1755.67 E:0.104114 |  And Messi up against Obamacano, who is rather caught out incidentally for the second goal.
[2322.16 - 2324.64] P:1762.66 E:0.103888 |  Obamacano dived in on the halfway line.
[2324.72 - 2326.24] P:1779.46 E:0.087449 |  Was caught out of position.
[2326.24 - 2327.84] P:1675.25 E:0.097806 |  France were all over the place.
[2327.84 - 2330.48] P:1684.46 E:0.092245 |  And Argentina really took advantage of the space.
[2330.48 - 2331.76] P:1696.91 E:0.116743 |  He's the one who gave it away as well.
[2332.64 - 2334.16] P:1758.16 E:0.105438 |  Desperation just to win it back.
[2334.96 - 2338.40] P:1678.16 E:0.102705 |  You knew as soon as he did that, they were away.
[2338.40 - 2340.96] P:1720.18 E:0.089806 |  Whether they could be clinical, they were.
[2342.00 - 2343.28] P:1690.53 E:0.106355 |  Argentina too.
[2343.28 - 2344.32] P:1743.36 E:0.096808 |  France, 0.
[2344.32 - 2345.36] P:1648.22 E:0.112281 |  Halftime approaching.
[2346.64 - 2353.20] P:1653.96 E:0.105521 |  And the world champions, France, are going to have to pull something truly
[2353.20 - 2354.80] P:1727.35 E:0.106929 |  traumatic out to turn this around.
[2355.60 - 2357.52] P:1607.56 E:0.099076 |  Messi, still plenty of time though.
[2357.52 - 2361.60] P:1552.08 E:0.101821 |  Messi inside his own half, just taps the ball back into central defence.
[2361.60 - 2364.16] P:1688.63 E:0.107074 |  And Ottenenbi gives it out to the left-hand side.
[2364.16 - 2366.00] P:1743.09 E:0.116242 |  And it looks as though France are going to make a change.
[2366.00 - 2369.52] P:1672.15 E:0.105150 |  Marcus Turand has been called forward by Didier Deschamps.
[2370.24 - 2373.44] P:1662.57 E:0.103909 |  The son of his old teammate, Lillian Turand.
[2374.16 - 2378.40] P:1755.27 E:0.104829 |  And that change is going to be made before halftime.
[2378.40 - 2380.64] P:1673.48 E:0.109896 |  You said it, the two of you, that he had to be proactive.
[2380.64 - 2382.24] P:1624.22 E:0.107618 |  He had to do something, Didier Deschamps.
[2382.24 - 2384.40] P:1694.91 E:0.096957 |  And he's not going to wait until halftime.
[2384.40 - 2387.12] P:1723.29 E:0.100187 |  And it looks as though it's going to be a double change he's going to make.
[2387.12 - 2392.40] P:1853.97 E:0.103415 |  So desperate times calling for desperate measures for the World Cup holders.
[2392.40 - 2394.08] P:1806.95 E:0.079968 |  Argentina are in possession.
[2394.08 - 2396.00] P:1718.25 E:0.091400 |  Argentina with it on the right-hand side.
[2396.00 - 2399.44] P:1650.04 E:0.078251 |  Molina, but then Chumeni is able to hook it forward.
[2399.44 - 2401.12] P:1804.13 E:0.098346 |  But there's no one there in a dark blue shirt.
[2401.12 - 2402.56] P:1770.19 E:0.085284 |  Giroud will chase it.
[2402.56 - 2404.08] P:1700.24 E:0.102815 |  But it's played forward by Romero.
[2404.80 - 2409.76] P:1853.80 E:0.099525 |  And now Molina again to De Paul, who will go back into central defence.
[2409.76 - 2411.28] P:1826.10 E:0.110897 |  So a double change for something.
[2411.28 - 2415.84] P:1700.77 E:0.099712 |  Yeah, Turand came on and he'll play off the left-hand side.
[2415.84 - 2416.96] P:1849.12 E:0.117410 |  So it looks...
[2416.96 - 2418.48] P:1752.00 E:0.115678 |  Called by Kunde on the far side.
[2418.48 - 2421.92] P:1769.61 E:0.111791 |  It looks as if Mbappe will go and play centre-forward.
[2421.92 - 2427.12] P:1746.61 E:0.098351 |  And Mouane, the goal scorer, came off the bench to score against Morocco.
[2428.08 - 2429.36] P:1705.97 E:0.112827 |  He'll go on the right-hand side.
[2429.36 - 2432.08] P:1694.10 E:0.103630 |  So it looks like Dembele will be the one to make way.
[2432.08 - 2434.48] P:1726.78 E:0.095212 |  And Olivia Giroud, I think.
[2434.48 - 2435.92] P:1836.71 E:0.091707 |  Yep, that's right. It is.
[2435.92 - 2437.68] P:1765.18 E:0.098883 |  The red number nine is up.
[2437.68 - 2443.28] P:1936.03 E:0.091722 |  So Giroud and Dembele off before half-time in the World Cup final.
[2443.28 - 2444.40] P:1863.07 E:0.095986 |  What a disappointment.
[2444.40 - 2446.40] P:1840.93 E:0.106339 |  And for Olivier Giroud, 36.
[2446.96 - 2450.48] P:1891.28 E:0.106331 |  You know, he almost certainly never got an opportunity like this again.
[2450.48 - 2452.08] P:1975.74 E:0.106488 |  And he's not last at the first half.
[2452.64 - 2455.20] P:2013.05 E:0.113887 |  And four goals at this World Cup.
[2455.20 - 2459.20] P:2004.85 E:0.114718 |  Such a totem for them as well when they won four years ago.
[2459.20 - 2461.20] P:2048.23 E:0.112095 |  And that's it. It's Nikes Auber, ruthless.
[2462.16 - 2463.92] P:1992.00 E:0.111798 |  Remarkable decision that.
[2463.92 - 2467.28] P:1957.05 E:0.106832 |  Taking off the all-time leading goal scorer.
[2467.36 - 2469.68] P:1842.28 E:0.101608 |  And when the one thing that you do need is goals.
[2470.88 - 2475.52] P:1701.70 E:0.096582 |  Just watching there, there was a little acknowledgement between Deschamps and Giroud.
[2476.48 - 2478.32] P:1637.85 E:0.096526 |  And France have been so flat.
[2478.32 - 2481.84] P:1828.06 E:0.098263 |  I mean, listen, we've talked as well over the last few days about this virus
[2481.84 - 2483.84] P:1867.55 E:0.096621 |  that has run through the French squad.
[2484.40 - 2488.48] P:1783.21 E:0.089555 |  I think you have to consider whether that is a factor in what we're witnessing here.
[2489.12 - 2490.80] P:1588.39 E:0.103747 |  Because they have been so flat.
[2490.80 - 2494.40] P:1644.80 E:0.090239 |  But then again, this is not completely out of keeping
[2494.40 - 2496.16] P:1689.96 E:0.109823 |  with the way that they've played up this World Cup.
[2496.24 - 2498.40] P:1743.64 E:0.092184 |  Argentina have just dominated them.
[2498.40 - 2499.44] P:1768.56 E:0.111851 |  So a double change.
[2500.24 - 2505.60] P:1650.66 E:0.098456 |  And Turand and Colomboani have come on.
[2506.48 - 2509.68] P:1646.02 E:0.099257 |  And Bapé is now playing through the middle.
[2509.68 - 2512.80] P:1653.17 E:0.099999 |  But a free kick has been conceded by the French.
[2514.24 - 2515.84] P:1718.99 E:0.115100 |  Brafowl over there on the far side.
[2515.84 - 2519.52] P:1648.68 E:0.104810 |  So it's a free kick to the team that lead by two goals to Nile.
[2519.52 - 2525.68] P:1744.90 E:0.091583 |  So two of the most experienced men in World Football have scored the goals.
[2525.68 - 2528.80] P:1591.85 E:0.097083 |  Lionel Messi from the penalty spot with the opener.
[2528.80 - 2532.32] P:1639.24 E:0.083168 |  So he now leads the top scoring standings.
[2532.32 - 2533.84] P:1711.35 E:0.106560 |  Six goals at this World Cup.
[2534.56 - 2540.96] P:1629.35 E:0.098066 |  So Messi scoring the opening goal as he wins his 172nd cap.
[2541.52 - 2545.36] P:1683.73 E:0.111917 |  And Angel Di Maria as he wins his 130th.
[2546.16 - 2552.56] P:1685.07 E:0.106221 |  And it is Argentina who are backed by this Geffrin and Coris from their supporters.
[2552.56 - 2554.40] P:1581.18 E:0.104515 |  Di Maria on the left hand side.
[2554.48 - 2556.16] P:1692.53 E:0.106452 |  Di Maria taking on Cundé.
[2556.16 - 2558.08] P:1704.22 E:0.092333 |  Fences off the French right back.
[2558.08 - 2560.64] P:1777.99 E:0.093806 |  He's just able to get to it and play it forward.
[2560.64 - 2563.04] P:1798.97 E:0.101970 |  But Colomboani is caught in possession.
[2563.04 - 2567.84] P:1823.34 E:0.108408 |  But the tackle actually causes the ball to run back over the dead ball line.
[2567.84 - 2571.60] P:1840.69 E:0.096330 |  And it is a goal kick to France.
[2571.60 - 2572.00] P:1615.48 E:0.087951 |  Rob.
[2573.52 - 2577.28] P:1781.43 E:0.105760 |  You're looking at France now and you're looking at whether they've changed shape or great deal.
[2578.48 - 2582.16] P:1800.95 E:0.111008 |  And it's Turand who's holding higher on the left hand side.
[2583.12 - 2586.64] P:1768.58 E:0.102341 |  Realistically, they've got two minutes to get through to half time.
[2586.64 - 2590.72] P:1790.59 E:0.090439 |  And Deschamps will have to have the team talk of his life to get anything.
[2591.36 - 2592.80] P:1686.14 E:0.108868 |  Any semblance out of this.
[2595.36 - 2598.64] P:1697.42 E:0.114483 |  So Argentina looking good.
[2600.56 - 2603.92] P:1798.94 E:0.105359 |  Playing the ball out and it bounces off Alparez.
[2603.92 - 2607.20] P:1770.50 E:0.103871 |  Trumani, that's a nice piece of footwork from him.
[2607.28 - 2608.24] P:1783.98 E:0.116403 |  It's a rabbi-off.
[2608.24 - 2610.80] P:1900.20 E:0.117761 |  But Argentina are tigerish.
[2610.80 - 2613.68] P:1858.10 E:0.106387 |  And De Paul is into the tackle on Turand.
[2613.68 - 2615.52] P:1792.13 E:0.102985 |  And the ball's deflected out of play for a throw.
[2615.52 - 2618.40] P:1747.93 E:0.110159 |  And the tail of Hernandez is going to take to Trumani.
[2619.52 - 2622.48] P:1652.68 E:0.112842 |  I mean, their tails are up.
[2622.48 - 2623.52] P:1543.62 E:0.099568 |  They're confident.
[2623.52 - 2626.16] P:1715.72 E:0.104590 |  They're not allowing France to settle on the ball.
[2626.16 - 2629.12] P:1627.51 E:0.108020 |  And it really looks from the position that they're in here.
[2629.12 - 2632.00] P:1515.29 E:0.112820 |  That there is that absolute hunger here.
[2632.00 - 2634.00] P:1727.31 E:0.096723 |  Not to give France a sniff.
[2634.00 - 2635.52] P:1480.70 E:0.094510 |  Not to give them a glimmer.
[2635.60 - 2638.80] P:1620.30 E:0.097069 |  And the French have been forced back halfway into their own half.
[2638.80 - 2642.40] P:1578.45 E:0.105319 |  Here is Verran, who will carry the ball forward towards the halfway line.
[2642.40 - 2645.92] P:1624.34 E:0.105649 |  He was one of the players who was doubtful because of that virus.
[2646.88 - 2649.20] P:1762.34 E:0.107903 |  Obama-Cano as well, coming back into the team.
[2649.20 - 2652.00] P:1781.37 E:0.102243 |  Canate is among the substitutes, incidentally.
[2652.00 - 2655.36] P:1746.49 E:0.116686 |  As the ball is played forward through the middle to Bafé.
[2655.36 - 2658.96] P:1702.64 E:0.101413 |  And the challenge that came in on him from Romero just caught him.
[2658.96 - 2661.28] P:1843.44 E:0.088604 |  Referee Marciniak gives the pre-cate France his way.
[2661.28 - 2662.80] P:1815.52 E:0.108459 |  He's playing on the edge, Romero.
[2663.60 - 2666.00] P:1795.90 E:0.106137 |  Tottenham fans won't be surprised by me saying that.
[2666.00 - 2670.96] P:1735.12 E:0.097169 |  That's about three or four in this half that he's been a little bit reckless
[2670.96 - 2675.92] P:1555.39 E:0.105663 |  and gone in a little bit rash and fortunate not to get booked so far.
[2677.12 - 2678.48] P:1646.06 E:0.118634 |  Pre-cate taken by France.
[2678.48 - 2680.64] P:1670.90 E:0.098627 |  We're in the last minute of the first half.
[2680.64 - 2683.68] P:1652.21 E:0.103442 |  Five live on the World Service from the BBC.
[2683.68 - 2685.36] P:1675.34 E:0.101794 |  Listen as well on BBC Sounds.
[2685.36 - 2686.80] P:1832.66 E:0.115542 |  Ball played through the...
[2686.80 - 2688.96] P:1765.32 E:0.105168 |  And Bafé, that in comes the challenge.
[2688.96 - 2692.00] P:1638.59 E:0.106227 |  And Argentina have got it again, but it's given away.
[2692.00 - 2694.72] P:1800.56 E:0.110420 |  This is, essentially, with Mouane.
[2695.28 - 2697.44] P:1725.06 E:0.102865 |  That in comes the challenge this time.
[2697.44 - 2700.16] P:1686.33 E:0.097742 |  Again from Romero, comes back at the Argentine defence.
[2700.16 - 2701.76] P:1684.00 E:0.091077 |  That's cleared away by Molina.
[2701.76 - 2704.16] P:1694.18 E:0.110616 |  And there's Messi, half-reinside his own half.
[2704.80 - 2707.84] P:1790.90 E:0.109080 |  Just working the ball back to Molina on the right-hand side.
[2707.84 - 2710.56] P:1695.06 E:0.100829 |  Molina turns it infield. Turan was there as well.
[2710.56 - 2714.56] P:1881.08 E:0.110844 |  Fourth official way down below just flashes the number on the electronic board.
[2714.56 - 2717.20] P:1764.50 E:0.096509 |  Now he can see it's seven minutes of added time.
[2718.56 - 2720.56] P:1788.35 E:0.108079 |  Not sure what we've seen in the first half.
[2720.64 - 2722.16] P:1750.35 E:0.107036 |  Particularly married seven minutes.
[2722.16 - 2723.68] P:1737.79 E:0.117213 |  So, of course, we had the stoppage for Maurice.
[2723.68 - 2725.52] P:1833.88 E:0.115848 |  Yeah, Maurice was down for a while, wasn't he?
[2725.52 - 2728.40] P:1869.78 E:0.104823 |  But actually a couple at the other end as well.
[2728.40 - 2734.16] P:1742.94 E:0.096721 |  Just defensively, Argentina defending with so much greater intensity.
[2735.04 - 2736.64] P:1607.26 E:0.112366 |  That battle in the middle of the park,
[2737.76 - 2740.00] P:1564.23 E:0.112235 |  Argentina really dominant there.
[2741.20 - 2743.84] P:1716.43 E:0.122124 |  As the ball is played over the top 10, the left-hand side.
[2744.40 - 2748.88] P:1720.39 E:0.104437 |  I think what we heard there was Angel Di Maria screaming for a free kick.
[2748.88 - 2749.84] P:1753.01 E:0.094834 |  He went down.
[2749.84 - 2752.80] P:1705.44 E:0.104418 |  I think it was either that or one of those children's toys.
[2752.80 - 2757.68] P:1656.73 E:0.110308 |  It was a scream of a thought of having to run another 50 yards after 45 minutes of football.
[2757.68 - 2759.12] P:1657.45 E:0.102292 |  It's Kunde with the challenge.
[2759.12 - 2762.32] P:1714.88 E:0.097693 |  And Di Maria went down, as Chris suggested.
[2762.96 - 2766.80] P:1559.52 E:0.111790 |  Sometimes he goes down, but there's not an awful lot wrong with him.
[2766.80 - 2768.24] P:1767.64 E:0.112036 |  But he's been pivotal, hasn't he?
[2768.24 - 2772.24] P:1553.98 E:0.108407 |  He's won the penalty and he scored the second goal Di Maria having bought.
[2772.24 - 2777.20] P:1498.44 E:0.089528 |  Being brought back in by the coach, Lionel Scoloni.
[2778.96 - 2780.00] P:1788.87 E:0.140879 |  And he's watching on.
[2780.00 - 2783.92] P:1808.12 E:0.109288 |  He's been there right on the edge of the coaching area the full-time.
[2783.92 - 2784.88] P:1805.12 E:0.094657 |  Track suit manager.
[2785.52 - 2787.52] P:1783.44 E:0.112532 |  Track suit bottoms, trainers on.
[2787.52 - 2790.48] P:1867.73 E:0.112703 |  Watching the ball being played forward, which deflects out to Mbappe,
[2790.48 - 2793.60] P:1877.66 E:0.110402 |  who has actually come out to the left-hand side, looks for Turan.
[2793.60 - 2797.92] P:1929.66 E:0.109090 |  The long legs of Marcus Turan, takes it on down the line, tries to work it back.
[2797.92 - 2800.88] P:1747.13 E:0.113996 |  But there are two, three Argentine players, and then there's a high foot
[2801.52 - 2804.56] P:1719.42 E:0.107145 |  from Teo Hernandez onto Paul, who went straight down.
[2804.56 - 2805.84] P:1785.61 E:0.093636 |  referee will come across.
[2805.84 - 2807.68] P:1762.86 E:0.093306 |  I think that's a final warning for Teo Hernandez,
[2807.68 - 2812.24] P:1734.19 E:0.093651 |  who actually throws the ball away in disgust as he's sent on his way by the referee.
[2812.24 - 2814.96] P:1779.54 E:0.087615 |  Three-kick Argentina, they lead 2-0.
[2814.96 - 2817.36] P:1689.21 E:0.091278 |  They've absolutely dominated the first half of this World Cup.
[2817.92 - 2818.96] P:1620.03 E:0.118056 |  Yep, absolutely.
[2819.52 - 2824.00] P:1455.61 E:0.100021 |  And they don't have to defend ferociously, don't they?
[2824.00 - 2826.00] P:1646.87 E:0.105596 |  They fight, they scrap, they harry.
[2826.00 - 2827.52] P:1644.37 E:0.092138 |  They do everything ferociously, Chris.
[2828.56 - 2830.00] P:1594.77 E:0.119983 |  They absolutely do, but.
[2830.00 - 2831.92] P:1698.86 E:0.087272 |  Did you listen to them sing the national anthem?
[2831.92 - 2832.56] P:1707.02 E:0.106260 |  Ferocious.
[2833.36 - 2834.24] P:1802.34 E:0.113042 |  Well, passionate.
[2834.24 - 2836.24] P:1552.13 E:0.103145 |  Is there a difference, John, a little bit?
[2836.24 - 2838.48] P:1557.34 E:0.105994 |  Passion, bordering on ferocity.
[2840.00 - 2841.92] P:1596.40 E:0.113762 |  They've been the dominant team, haven't they?
[2842.64 - 2845.36] P:1671.54 E:0.094149 |  They've out-thought, out-worked, out-thought.
[2846.40 - 2851.20] P:1694.53 E:0.097890 |  The French team, and as Rob said, Tidio de Chomp has made a couple of changes already, but
[2852.96 - 2860.72] P:1467.68 E:0.098322 |  you're going to have to have a drastic turnaround, a halftime, to try and somehow get back into this game.
[2860.72 - 2865.76] P:1638.52 E:0.092870 |  It's going to have to be transformational, what they do in this match.
[2865.84 - 2868.88] P:1649.72 E:0.102371 |  To turn this around from two-nil down in a World Cup final,
[2869.44 - 2872.56] P:1696.08 E:0.087314 |  when they have just been bossed, as they say.
[2872.56 - 2875.92] P:1750.17 E:0.086135 |  Here is Molina playing it through.
[2875.92 - 2878.72] P:1732.97 E:0.103342 |  Sebrechaan's Argentina might have gotten another one before halftime.
[2878.72 - 2882.40] P:1872.53 E:0.110381 |  It's played through for Alvarez, but Veran comes across and puts it out of play.
[2883.04 - 2886.00] P:1729.80 E:0.103900 |  And it's a throwing full Argentina down the right-hand side.
[2886.56 - 2890.96] P:1524.12 E:0.102457 |  Argentina, who don't forget are the reigning South American champions winning that last year.
[2890.96 - 2894.88] P:1651.58 E:0.091854 |  That was Messi's first senior international title.
[2895.52 - 2900.64] P:1667.86 E:0.102518 |  And how that was celebrated, winning it as they did in the Maracanar against Brazil.
[2901.20 - 2906.16] P:1599.81 E:0.103001 |  And then beat the European champions Italy in that one-off finalissima earlier this year.
[2906.72 - 2911.28] P:1787.78 E:0.099685 |  And now they're dominating the World Champions, the World Cup holders, France.
[2913.12 - 2915.76] P:1852.08 E:0.106228 |  At the moment, it looks as though it is going to be Argentina,
[2915.76 - 2919.76] P:1722.67 E:0.086700 |  not France, who will get that third star on their shirts.
[2920.72 - 2923.04] P:1536.39 E:0.096756 |  Ball is with Otramendi at the back.
[2923.76 - 2928.32] P:1702.62 E:0.100384 |  You might have thought that these days in the big time were finished when he left Manchester City,
[2928.32 - 2932.48] P:1623.91 E:0.093229 |  34 years old now, but as I say, Benfica doing great things.
[2932.48 - 2934.48] P:1497.34 E:0.106667 |  And here he is on the verge of winning a World Cup.
[2935.52 - 2937.20] P:1707.20 E:0.103613 |  France coming forward.
[2937.20 - 2941.84] P:1735.19 E:0.102150 |  We've had almost four minutes of added time at the end of this first half.
[2942.64 - 2944.24] P:1424.41 E:0.116141 |  And it's Veran in the orange boots.
[2944.96 - 2946.64] P:1687.96 E:0.108652 |  He looks forward, but goes square.
[2947.60 - 2949.36] P:1788.14 E:0.093895 |  They look bereft, France.
[2949.36 - 2950.64] P:1737.38 E:0.107266 |  They look short on ideas.
[2951.60 - 2952.64] P:1678.66 E:0.104033 |  Turan.
[2953.68 - 2956.80] P:1741.27 E:0.100748 |  Turan tries to dance in field, but they're there again.
[2956.80 - 2961.20] P:1790.13 E:0.092260 |  Those ferocious Argentines, two men on him in dives.
[2961.92 - 2964.96] P:1601.24 E:0.098718 |  Molina with the challenge, gets a bit of the ball, got a bit of the man as well.
[2964.96 - 2966.40] P:1713.59 E:0.096439 |  He won't worry about that.
[2966.40 - 2970.72] P:1714.10 E:0.088819 |  And then France take the throwing back to Obamacano and across to Veran in the centre circle.
[2970.72 - 2972.64] P:1743.02 E:0.092124 |  He plays it across to Kunde.
[2972.64 - 2973.36] P:1819.70 E:0.105944 |  Kunde looks up.
[2973.36 - 2974.64] P:1848.70 E:0.102283 |  Griezmann's another one.
[2974.64 - 2976.48] P:1825.01 E:0.093339 |  We're talking about him before the game.
[2976.48 - 2977.84] P:1745.46 E:0.111118 |  Maybe the player of the World Cup.
[2978.56 - 2979.84] P:1921.87 E:0.094289 |  He's not featured in the final.
[2980.16 - 2980.88] P:1953.13 E:0.097604 |  Anonymous.
[2980.88 - 2983.52] P:1920.24 E:0.104527 |  And that's France's performance in total.
[2983.52 - 2986.88] P:1743.90 E:0.097835 |  It's been anonymous and just bereft of ideas.
[2986.88 - 2989.52] P:1622.05 E:0.100340 |  And really, they're making it up as they go along now.
[2989.52 - 2992.96] P:1816.28 E:0.096350 |  The shape's gone, the team's gone, the pattern of play's gone.
[2992.96 - 2995.68] P:1851.90 E:0.106797 |  They're just looking at someone saying, please turn up.
[2997.36 - 3001.44] P:1790.78 E:0.095648 |  Argentina are leading France by two goals to nil.
[3002.32 - 3004.48] P:1601.03 E:0.099506 |  And the ball's out of play for throwing on the far side.
[3005.12 - 3005.92] P:1528.45 E:0.094982 |  And again, those...
[3006.96 - 3009.68] P:1428.30 E:0.109446 |  I mean, what a scene we have here in this stadium.
[3010.16 - 3015.04] P:1660.89 E:0.103673 |  And I know so much has been said and written about the construction of these stadiums.
[3015.68 - 3022.88] P:1517.48 E:0.089472 |  But in terms of the visual site, as you look around it,
[3022.88 - 3026.16] P:1700.41 E:0.088769 |  with all of the gold lettering and gold trimming,
[3026.16 - 3029.60] P:1538.31 E:0.087512 |  and the way that it undulates around the top, those curving lines,
[3029.60 - 3036.16] P:1622.42 E:0.076834 |  and the roof above our heads, it is a fitting scene for a World Cup final.
[3036.96 - 3040.80] P:1557.14 E:0.090227 |  As the throwing is taken over on the far side by Argentina.
[3040.80 - 3043.60] P:1539.91 E:0.089304 |  It's cleared away on the edge of the box by Upe McCarno.
[3044.32 - 3045.92] P:1658.58 E:0.088662 |  Comes back for Argentina.
[3045.92 - 3050.64] P:1652.73 E:0.108083 |  Griezmann slides in against Di Maria and is able to get the ball away.
[3050.64 - 3053.92] P:1750.42 E:0.103746 |  And then Cunde puts in the challenge, and that comes off the Frenchman.
[3053.92 - 3058.48] P:1748.51 E:0.096987 |  And it's out of play for a throw in to Argentina down the left-hand side.
[3059.12 - 3063.12] P:1535.98 E:0.087331 |  In the sixth minute of added time at the end of the first half.
[3063.60 - 3070.48] P:1559.31 E:0.084095 |  Messi just knocks it back centrally and all the way back now into the centre circle.
[3070.48 - 3074.88] P:1586.37 E:0.086526 |  Where Christian Romero looks up, finds the pass to Di Maria.
[3074.88 - 3077.84] P:1518.59 E:0.097633 |  No, it's over his head and out of play for a throw in to France.
[3077.84 - 3079.28] P:1712.44 E:0.097612 |  Ten yards inside the run.
[3079.28 - 3080.64] P:1619.86 E:0.096436 |  But that's their outball.
[3080.64 - 3082.96] P:1747.15 E:0.110381 |  They've always known, they've always got that,
[3082.96 - 3084.96] P:1860.39 E:0.097719 |  and they play with the comfort of knowing that.
[3084.96 - 3086.88] P:1669.24 E:0.105540 |  Culembroani now is able to dart forward,
[3086.88 - 3089.44] P:1731.54 E:0.102232 |  income the Argentinians, one of them got a touch on him.
[3089.44 - 3091.04] P:1743.26 E:0.091945 |  It's given us a free kick.
[3091.28 - 3092.08] P:1708.50 E:0.106810 |  Here we go.
[3092.08 - 3098.48] P:1732.81 E:0.080114 |  And Argentinian player has dropped to the ground on the far side.
[3098.48 - 3100.56] P:1599.57 E:0.097614 |  And it was played past him by Culembroani.
[3101.20 - 3102.96] P:1665.87 E:0.094592 |  And Fernandez has gone down.
[3103.52 - 3107.52] P:1660.06 E:0.089400 |  And it was played past him whether there was contact there as Culembroani was trying to
[3108.88 - 3109.92] P:1682.74 E:0.109382 |  wriggle away through.
[3110.48 - 3111.68] P:1706.90 E:0.093197 |  Sure, there's an awful lot on that.
[3112.48 - 3114.56] P:1632.38 E:0.103175 |  He went down Culembroani, won the free kick,
[3114.56 - 3117.20] P:1664.74 E:0.087220 |  and then Fernandez went down and he's not good up yet.
[3117.20 - 3120.88] P:1591.76 E:0.105622 |  And referee Marciniac is not allowed the physios onto the field
[3120.88 - 3122.80] P:1712.39 E:0.089086 |  a lot, I think as he does that.
[3122.80 - 3127.04] P:1777.91 E:0.098769 |  It's a yellow card for him, for Fernandez, for putting in the challenge.
[3127.04 - 3129.44] P:1894.30 E:0.106443 |  It should have been Otamenda who was booked.
[3129.44 - 3131.04] P:1848.39 E:0.107715 |  I thought he was the one who made the challenge,
[3131.04 - 3133.36] P:1544.06 E:0.100557 |  but then Fernandez, embarrassing from him.
[3134.96 - 3138.08] P:1584.34 E:0.109878 |  I think he was claiming he was struck by Muani.
[3139.76 - 3142.64] P:1677.10 E:0.104514 |  He's up on his feet now, but that's shocking from him.
[3143.28 - 3144.00] P:1817.63 E:0.112050 |  Free kick then.
[3144.56 - 3149.20] P:1852.17 E:0.100718 |  Well, this is our chance for France to try and pull something out of the fire.
[3149.20 - 3153.44] P:1889.42 E:0.100141 |  Griezmann plays it in all the way towards the back post, but Baran couldn't get there.
[3154.24 - 3157.44] P:1972.12 E:0.111538 |  It was well beyond him, and it's all the way through for the goal kick.
[3157.44 - 3162.80] P:1848.73 E:0.111819 |  Of course, in this sort of position now, there is no Elidia Giroud having been substituted
[3163.44 - 3166.48] P:1826.62 E:0.108227 |  in the A-Dacion, feeling that he had to make that double change
[3167.60 - 3172.88] P:1699.04 E:0.101619 |  in what, the 41st minute, just because of the way that the whole thing was running away from the
[3173.68 - 3177.12] P:1742.96 E:0.095286 |  Demboulian Giroud off the halftime whistle goes.
[3177.12 - 3180.80] P:1772.10 E:0.087974 |  What a half of World Cup final football for Argentina.
[3180.80 - 3182.40] P:1658.94 E:0.096914 |  They were actually surrounding the referee.
[3182.40 - 3186.48] P:1676.82 E:0.097579 |  Martinez, the goalkeeper, has gone there and his teammates have pushed him away.
[3186.48 - 3189.52] P:1793.59 E:0.095779 |  And actually the referee says to him, just go on, off you go.
[3189.52 - 3193.52] P:1833.70 E:0.088134 |  Go to the dressing room, and it will be an extremely satisfied
[3193.52 - 3195.68] P:1712.76 E:0.097180 |  Argentina dressing room at halftime.
[3195.68 - 3200.40] P:1747.38 E:0.094514 |  They lead through the Lionel Messi penalty, and that goal from Angel Di Maria,
[3200.40 - 3204.88] P:1729.64 E:0.077317 |  the blister encounter attack, and it really, you think,
[3204.88 - 3207.68] P:1722.16 E:0.093788 |  can that possibly be a way back for France?
[3207.68 - 3211.68] P:1845.01 E:0.100178 |  The only hope that you're looking at now is that Didier Deschamps turned around.
[3211.68 - 3214.32] P:1825.91 E:0.088347 |  It's like, we can't play any worse.
[3214.32 - 3216.40] P:1885.72 E:0.082166 |  Just go, just go for it.
[3216.40 - 3219.92] P:1832.85 E:0.091656 |  One goal, we saw what happened against the Netherlands with Argentina.
[3219.92 - 3225.52] P:1822.54 E:0.085512 |  With this backing, it might get nervous, but they just look so comfortable,
[3225.52 - 3227.92] P:1949.75 E:0.098656 |  and France have looked so short of ideas.
[3228.48 - 3230.32] P:1861.80 E:0.075224 |  It's been a walk in the park from...
[3230.32 - 3232.32] P:1868.82 E:0.081136 |  Thank you, Rob Green. Thank you, Chris Sutton.
[3232.32 - 3234.00] P:1813.13 E:0.094734 |  Halftime here in Lusail.
[3234.80 - 3237.68] P:1839.84 E:0.080919 |  Argentina 2, France 0.
[3239.04 - 3240.96] P:1632.00 E:0.100127 |  Chris Sutton, stat man's tweeted to say,
[3240.96 - 3244.40] P:1671.24 E:0.097635 |  Di Maria going in at left wing has been a masterclass from Scoloni.
[3244.40 - 3246.96] P:1775.70 E:0.089569 |  First manager to properly target Cundes.
[3246.96 - 3248.56] P:1576.07 E:0.093186 |  It's not where we were expecting him to play.
[3249.52 - 3252.48] P:1786.67 E:0.098770 |  No, absolutely. We thought it'd start on that right-hand side.
[3252.48 - 3255.92] P:1909.18 E:0.087315 |  He didn't, and it was a, you know, you'd say you'd say,
[3255.92 - 3258.48] P:1827.49 E:0.088360 |  tactical genius at this moment in time.
[3258.48 - 3263.20] P:1826.15 E:0.093907 |  I think where the half was won for the Argentinians, though,
[3263.20 - 3266.56] P:1762.90 E:0.103814 |  in that central midfield area, they were getting overloads in there.
[3266.56 - 3269.12] P:1720.71 E:0.083456 |  Messi was dropping deep and getting on the halftime.
[3269.12 - 3273.04] P:1771.45 E:0.093621 |  They were trying to feed the ball out left to the left to Di Maria.
[3273.84 - 3275.92] P:1798.31 E:0.099403 |  But France have been really out of work.
[3275.92 - 3280.24] P:1829.14 E:0.080638 |  Second balls, the Argentinians have been picking up all the time.
[3280.24 - 3284.64] P:1846.12 E:0.084863 |  And as Rob said, it's been a really flat French performance.
[3284.64 - 3288.64] P:1937.37 E:0.085425 |  I mean, talk about illness in the camp this week, but there's, you know,
[3288.64 - 3292.24] P:1846.13 E:0.099551 |  I mean, maybe that is an excuse, but Argentina have blown them away.
[3292.24 - 3294.08] P:1783.93 E:0.102230 |  And when they lose possession,
[3294.08 - 3296.80] P:1898.99 E:0.089775 |  they've actually gone after the French team as well
[3296.80 - 3299.76] P:1594.20 E:0.094232 |  and pressed them fairly high, but they have been so dominant.
[3299.76 - 3304.16] P:1857.93 E:0.086094 |  And at this moment in time, it's hard to see Argentina letting this game slip.
[3305.20 - 3307.68] P:1616.55 E:0.108612 |  I mean, the stats, aside from the score line,
[3307.68 - 3310.40] P:1784.71 E:0.089449 |  just emphasise how dominant Argentina have been.
[3310.40 - 3314.96] P:1694.45 E:0.083608 |  They've been 59% possession compared to 41% for the French.
[3314.96 - 3318.00] P:1896.18 E:0.087439 |  Six shots for Argentina, none for the French.
[3318.00 - 3321.20] P:1825.12 E:0.088153 |  Three of those on target, three off target,
[3321.20 - 3326.64] P:1877.68 E:0.087990 |  nearly 300 passes for Argentina, just over 200 passes for France.
[3326.64 - 3330.24] P:1895.43 E:0.095289 |  Julien Laurent has joined us at halftime.
[3330.24 - 3335.20] P:1912.19 E:0.089529 |  I'm fairly sure that you mailed, as you came to put your headphones on
[3335.20 - 3338.16] P:1903.09 E:0.085041 |  and take the microphone, all that was bad at me.
[3339.12 - 3341.92] P:1896.64 E:0.106012 |  That was bad, yeah. I don't think they'd be crashing any parties tonight.
[3341.92 - 3346.08] P:1919.43 E:0.094593 |  If we get invited, we'll be lucky to the post match Argentina party.
[3348.16 - 3351.44] P:1801.69 E:0.097315 |  I mean, I think it was almost perfect from the Argentines, I have to say.
[3351.44 - 3352.64] P:1812.83 E:0.093239 |  I heard what Cristus said.
[3352.64 - 3355.20] P:1682.30 E:0.090794 |  I think they've been so good in everything they've done.
[3355.20 - 3357.44] P:1821.89 E:0.081924 |  They've lost the midfield, they win the second ball,
[3357.44 - 3360.24] P:1955.51 E:0.093172 |  they press really well. Alvarez is a machine.
[3360.88 - 3362.72] P:1861.07 E:0.099349 |  They're good on the counterattack on the second goal.
[3362.72 - 3364.32] P:1853.05 E:0.093017 |  They're very good in possession.
[3364.32 - 3366.56] P:1914.30 E:0.091790 |  Of course, it's a mistake by Dembele on the first goal,
[3367.20 - 3369.44] P:1878.70 E:0.088917 |  who should not fail Demaria.
[3369.44 - 3371.84] P:1821.84 E:0.101752 |  And by the way, we were thinking Demaria would play on the right.
[3372.40 - 3375.20] P:1764.75 E:0.097842 |  He plays on the left and a coup de deux to the sword.
[3375.20 - 3376.96] P:1986.45 E:0.082228 |  So, well done to Argentina.
[3376.96 - 3380.16] P:1846.52 E:0.078542 |  I mean, Deschamps has never subbed one player,
[3380.16 - 3382.08] P:1987.48 E:0.104049 |  let alone two players so early in the game ever,
[3382.08 - 3384.24] P:1810.94 E:0.079012 |  in the 10 years that he's been in charge of this team.
[3384.24 - 3386.80] P:1746.54 E:0.096584 |  And I think when you change two players after 40 minutes,
[3386.80 - 3387.92] P:1684.14 E:0.101793 |  there's really something wrong.
[3387.92 - 3390.16] P:1729.67 E:0.085025 |  And I don't know if they can come back in this game.
[3390.16 - 3391.76] P:1662.92 E:0.100202 |  I mean, the Dutch came back, but it was a...
[3392.64 - 3394.08] P:1865.36 E:0.096056 |  They look so dominant in Argentina.
[3394.16 - 3395.28] P:1475.58 E:0.081296 |  I can see that.
[3395.28 - 3397.20] P:1722.05 E:0.099300 |  France have got no...
[3399.04 - 3400.32] P:1636.59 E:0.102082 |  They look all over the place.
[3400.32 - 3402.88] P:1712.94 E:0.101567 |  I see they look all over the place without a plan.
[3403.52 - 3407.68] P:1680.07 E:0.094293 |  And actually on the ball, they are making mistake after mistake after second.
[3407.68 - 3409.20] P:1662.66 E:0.101730 |  And I think we all take your point that
[3409.20 - 3411.36] P:1668.99 E:0.098977 |  Argentina repressed them and they've harried them
[3411.36 - 3413.12] P:1679.68 E:0.099184 |  and they haven't given them any time on it.
[3413.68 - 3415.20] P:1758.60 E:0.114962 |  But even towards the end there,
[3415.20 - 3417.36] P:1662.25 E:0.097452 |  the ball was passed back to Verano one point,
[3417.36 - 3418.96] P:1764.84 E:0.103015 |  and he just let it go under his foot
[3418.96 - 3421.28] P:1709.76 E:0.101583 |  and had to go back 20 yards to go and get it,
[3421.76 - 3423.68] P:1676.34 E:0.095963 |  to then restart the move.
[3423.68 - 3425.44] P:1655.18 E:0.087737 |  It's been sloppy.
[3425.44 - 3426.08] P:1657.69 E:0.098941 |  Very sloppy.
[3426.08 - 3429.12] P:1628.61 E:0.099660 |  I think sloppy is the word in possession with Storch Griezmann.
[3429.12 - 3430.88] P:1633.94 E:0.100625 |  Even before the penalty,
[3430.88 - 3433.60] P:1721.94 E:0.101349 |  there are few balls that are in the last 30 yards
[3433.60 - 3435.92] P:1475.80 E:0.092117 |  where it's a bad pass, it's a bad touch,
[3435.92 - 3436.96] P:1571.12 E:0.094718 |  the ball comes again.
[3439.52 - 3442.32] P:1629.86 E:0.104666 |  It happens in the worst game that could happen in this tournament.
[3442.32 - 3442.88] P:1631.22 E:0.076308 |  That's the thing.
[3442.88 - 3446.24] P:1668.67 E:0.087025 |  And I think Argentina has to have forced those mistakes,
[3446.24 - 3447.20] P:1725.08 E:0.101471 |  of course, but you're right.
[3447.20 - 3449.76] P:1752.43 E:0.087820 |  The French just didn't turn up in time.
[3450.32 - 3452.24] P:1753.73 E:0.087775 |  And I think now they can regret it
[3452.24 - 3454.24] P:1730.88 E:0.090579 |  because there could even be three or four downs.
[3455.12 - 3456.72] P:1801.91 E:0.100563 |  They don't have an identity,
[3456.72 - 3458.80] P:1688.96 E:0.099535 |  a style of player brand of football.
[3458.80 - 3460.80] P:1873.70 E:0.094846 |  That's the way it looks throughout this tournament.
[3460.80 - 3462.24] P:1872.84 E:0.087824 |  You know, going into the game,
[3462.24 - 3464.48] P:1847.43 E:0.092357 |  I think we all thought it was going to be,
[3464.48 - 3466.72] P:1844.66 E:0.086982 |  you know, certain moments in this game.
[3467.28 - 3470.64] P:1873.12 E:0.097632 |  I don't think any of us saw one team would dominate
[3470.64 - 3472.48] P:1874.05 E:0.090265 |  as much as they have in this first half.
[3472.48 - 3476.32] P:1827.56 E:0.088393 |  But Argentina are just dictating this whole game so far.
[3476.40 - 3480.32] P:1849.01 E:0.087527 |  It's difficult to see France actually responding
[3480.32 - 3482.80] P:1835.19 E:0.094552 |  in the second half because they have no defined style.
[3482.80 - 3485.60] P:1748.67 E:0.098376 |  And now the panic has set in and Bafé has ascended forward.
[3485.60 - 3487.20] P:1759.64 E:0.087186 |  But how are you going to feed him?
[3487.20 - 3489.20] P:1850.23 E:0.081923 |  They can't get the ball to Griezmann.
[3489.20 - 3491.36] P:1778.05 E:0.100099 |  They can't get the ball to Rabiot on the half-turn
[3491.36 - 3492.80] P:1772.47 E:0.083714 |  and Slide passes in.
[3492.80 - 3493.60] P:1701.24 E:0.103912 |  I mean, that's the problem.
[3493.60 - 3494.16] P:1634.79 E:0.117597 |  Yeah, you're right.
[3494.16 - 3497.76] P:1825.94 E:0.095328 |  And we said we highlighted Griezmann before the start of the game.
[3497.76 - 3500.48] P:1795.65 E:0.084598 |  And we said that if they have a plan against him
[3500.48 - 3503.20] P:1827.53 E:0.090986 |  and if they can keep him away from the game,
[3503.20 - 3505.44] P:1821.61 E:0.092485 |  then I think they will dominate that midfield.
[3505.44 - 3508.64] P:1784.41 E:0.097045 |  And after that, this is where we can't really react.
[3508.64 - 3509.76] P:1709.32 E:0.087724 |  And that's exactly what happens.
[3510.48 - 3512.00] P:1819.09 E:0.096605 |  But the identity was never...
[3512.00 - 3513.52] P:1811.72 E:0.090987 |  It's not so much a problem of identity.
[3513.52 - 3516.08] P:1814.29 E:0.091480 |  It's before we've been ruthless.
[3516.08 - 3520.56] P:1827.87 E:0.087211 |  And that mistake by Dembele on the first goal
[3520.56 - 3522.80] P:1864.23 E:0.094894 |  is a terrible mistake that he should not be making.
[3522.80 - 3525.12] P:1818.79 E:0.095622 |  And they haven't made those mistakes before.
[3525.12 - 3528.32] P:1892.68 E:0.099276 |  On the second goal, I think should let the ball go out.
[3528.32 - 3529.36] P:1939.84 E:0.090163 |  The ball is for us.
[3529.36 - 3532.48] P:1959.11 E:0.089244 |  I don't know why he's trying to control the ball by the touchline
[3532.48 - 3534.08] P:1822.70 E:0.091848 |  and then trying these very difficult passes.
[3534.08 - 3535.52] P:1775.55 E:0.087401 |  And after that, the counterattack is on.
[3535.52 - 3537.20] P:1787.43 E:0.092190 |  And it's an amazing counterattack.
[3537.20 - 3538.72] P:1665.01 E:0.091079 |  Nothing away from the Argentines,
[3538.72 - 3541.60] P:1833.99 E:0.076167 |  but help massively by the French again
[3541.60 - 3544.48] P:1778.82 E:0.077456 |  and how poor they were, even tactically,
[3544.48 - 3546.80] P:1647.48 E:0.092023 |  how they set up on that pitch for the second goal.
[3546.80 - 3550.24] P:1691.25 E:0.082344 |  If the France haven't had a shot on goal, I mean, that's...
[3550.24 - 3552.32] P:1833.41 E:0.092149 |  So, you know, you're saying it's not about identity,
[3552.32 - 3554.72] P:1812.13 E:0.083031 |  but it sort of is in a way,
[3554.72 - 3556.56] P:1790.72 E:0.076267 |  because they don't look like threatening the...
[3556.56 - 3557.84] P:1426.25 E:0.115822 |  Yeah, no, no, one man by that.
[3557.84 - 3560.32] P:1889.47 E:0.097437 |  Usually Griezmann is at the heart of everything.
[3560.32 - 3561.84] P:1926.31 E:0.102501 |  The ball goes wide, he'll go on there,
[3561.84 - 3563.68] P:1964.59 E:0.084659 |  and Kylian on the left-hand side.
[3564.16 - 3565.76] P:1846.24 E:0.101344 |  He crosses in, Dembélé.
[3566.48 - 3568.40] P:1657.04 E:0.098337 |  But there's nothing of that tonight.
[3568.40 - 3570.80] P:1881.35 E:0.101166 |  And I think, again, this is the wrong time,
[3570.80 - 3573.04] P:1824.83 E:0.073534 |  the worst time to have an off there.
[3573.04 - 3575.68] P:1726.95 E:0.098096 |  So what are we going to expect from Muane then?
[3575.68 - 3578.48] P:1699.79 E:0.087194 |  Because he's a player who I've not seen so much.
[3578.48 - 3581.84] P:1628.59 E:0.088467 |  But what are they going to get different from Dembélé off that side?
[3581.84 - 3584.40] P:1562.29 E:0.091608 |  Well, the thing is, Chris, he's a centre-forward.
[3584.40 - 3588.56] P:1769.19 E:0.078810 |  That's playing wide now, which I am a bit struggling.
[3588.56 - 3590.72] P:1877.32 E:0.094134 |  Giroud, I can understand why you're taking him off.
[3590.72 - 3592.32] P:1809.80 E:0.090605 |  Dembélé, I'm a bit more struggling,
[3592.32 - 3596.56] P:1963.45 E:0.078545 |  unless you thought that mistake just took him out of the game.
[3596.56 - 3598.96] P:1808.87 E:0.103182 |  For Colomani, the pace is going forward.
[3598.96 - 3600.24] P:1931.54 E:0.094661 |  He's going to take on defenders.
[3600.24 - 3601.28] P:1826.46 E:0.084820 |  He's a young kid.
[3602.16 - 3603.36] P:1890.46 E:0.113195 |  He was not supposed to be here.
[3603.36 - 3604.72] P:1712.27 E:0.103234 |  He's only here because of injuries.
[3604.72 - 3606.80] P:1797.27 E:0.100246 |  He was in Japan on holidays when they called him and said,
[3606.80 - 3607.92] P:1829.80 E:0.084179 |  could we go injured?
[3607.92 - 3609.12] P:1912.39 E:0.069054 |  Please come back.
[3609.12 - 3612.24] P:1765.59 E:0.097706 |  He's here, and he will play with that kind of...
[3612.24 - 3613.84] P:1815.99 E:0.093810 |  Not really thinking and going for it.
[3613.84 - 3615.52] P:1741.09 E:0.098031 |  Same with Marcus Turham on the other side.
[3616.08 - 3617.60] P:1934.65 E:0.095992 |  I just don't think he's seen enough right now
[3617.60 - 3621.28] P:1794.45 E:0.083120 |  against the team as dominant and as experienced as this Argentine team.
[3622.40 - 3624.00] P:1758.60 E:0.121771 |  Michael Richards is also with us.
[3624.00 - 3625.84] P:1806.48 E:0.093393 |  Michael, you thought this one might be feisty,
[3625.84 - 3628.08] P:1871.95 E:0.091913 |  and certainly towards the end of the first half,
[3628.08 - 3630.96] P:1810.10 E:0.094726 |  Tempest came a little bit close to bubbling over,
[3630.96 - 3633.12] P:1787.82 E:0.091025 |  but it's been a really flat performance from France
[3633.12 - 3634.64] P:1666.97 E:0.096493 |  as we've just been discussing with Jules.
[3635.20 - 3637.12] P:1846.20 E:0.105265 |  What did Argentina do right here?
[3637.12 - 3641.12] P:1843.47 E:0.098777 |  And obviously, there was the unexpected positioning of Demarie on the left
[3641.12 - 3643.36] P:1778.98 E:0.091137 |  rather than on the right, and it seems to work for them.
[3644.56 - 3648.64] P:1906.55 E:0.088959 |  I just think the first goal killed the game.
[3648.64 - 3650.00] P:1805.56 E:0.101651 |  I don't think it was a penalty.
[3650.40 - 3653.44] P:1852.91 E:0.090806 |  I know, I think the majority of you lot think it was.
[3653.44 - 3657.52] P:1903.84 E:0.090851 |  It was already going down, and then Messi goes and scores.
[3657.52 - 3659.44] P:1991.83 E:0.090488 |  Argentina built confidence.
[3659.44 - 3661.36] P:1958.80 E:0.095422 |  They could go in a low block at times
[3661.36 - 3664.08] P:1948.05 E:0.094889 |  and then counterattack like they did for the second goal.
[3664.08 - 3667.20] P:1989.72 E:0.088551 |  I think the first goal just absolutely killed the game,
[3667.20 - 3669.68] P:1924.96 E:0.098437 |  but in fairness, Argentina in the midfield.
[3669.68 - 3670.80] P:1544.93 E:0.099528 |  We talked about Griezmann,
[3670.80 - 3674.96] P:1873.50 E:0.088696 |  the man who should nullify the space that Griezmann can get on their ace.
[3674.96 - 3676.40] P:1793.07 E:0.095487 |  He's been trying to drop deep,
[3676.40 - 3679.52] P:1766.29 E:0.077753 |  but what's happened normally with France is,
[3679.52 - 3681.04] P:1811.05 E:0.101389 |  they're using Griezmann today.
[3681.04 - 3682.40] P:1859.14 E:0.089324 |  Everything is going through Messi.
[3682.40 - 3687.52] P:1780.09 E:0.085490 |  Messi is the person who's dictating the flow and the rhythm of the game.
[3687.52 - 3692.48] P:1778.89 E:0.093551 |  That midfield three-miker for Argentina has absolutely dominated it.
[3692.48 - 3696.88] P:1832.43 E:0.092841 |  It's dominated it out of possession, and it's dominated it in possession.
[3696.88 - 3703.20] P:1901.29 E:0.091807 |  Statman senses the Alexis McAllister first half numbers, 92% pass accuracy,
[3703.20 - 3706.32] P:1933.97 E:0.091392 |  37 touches, 4 out of 5.
[3706.32 - 3708.16] P:1884.17 E:0.100446 |  I mean, he's put ground, Jules won.
[3708.80 - 3710.32] P:1969.52 E:0.098420 |  Tackles to you and me.
[3711.12 - 3715.52] P:1904.75 E:0.094056 |  1 out of 1 dribble completed, 1 key pass, 1 big chance created.
[3715.52 - 3717.76] P:1886.02 E:0.098713 |  He's run that midfield, really.
[3717.76 - 3720.32] P:1883.93 E:0.096478 |  And Rodrigo de Poz probably had his best game of the tournament.
[3721.04 - 3722.88] P:1761.36 E:0.108053 |  It's been brilliant to see, because what they're doing,
[3722.88 - 3726.08] P:1839.00 E:0.087557 |  they're all played in that, and we thought Ferreiras was going to play.
[3726.08 - 3726.88] P:1621.52 E:0.094497 |  It was a big decision.
[3726.88 - 3728.48] P:1778.01 E:0.089096 |  We have to, I've already mentioned it before,
[3728.48 - 3730.64] P:1886.45 E:0.098531 |  but to bring Dima here, and he's playing the other side,
[3730.64 - 3732.08] P:1860.66 E:0.081398 |  it'd be outstanding.
[3732.08 - 3735.28] P:1891.74 E:0.090664 |  But what has allowed the other three is to just hold their positions,
[3735.28 - 3736.80] P:1797.23 E:0.096369 |  and in batting, can't get in the game.
[3736.80 - 3740.72] P:1816.03 E:0.097283 |  Every time a batting gets the ball, De Paul is going out there,
[3740.72 - 3742.64] P:1813.76 E:0.079002 |  and blocking the pass into it.
[3742.64 - 3745.20] P:1909.19 E:0.084018 |  Then Fernandez is picking up the pieces,
[3745.20 - 3749.12] P:1843.51 E:0.100293 |  and occupying the space where Griezmann would normally get in the ball.
[3749.12 - 3751.12] P:1808.13 E:0.090971 |  And the McAllister's popping up in areas where...
[3751.76 - 3753.20] P:1833.94 E:0.092259 |  McAllister's at Brighton.
[3753.20 - 3755.92] P:1993.26 E:0.091273 |  He looks like he's a real Madrid player.
[3757.04 - 3757.76] P:1858.15 E:0.103095 |  I'm actually...
[3757.76 - 3760.80] P:1861.06 E:0.101801 |  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3760.80 - 3764.16] P:1899.64 E:0.095180 |  Brighton have played some very, very good football this season.
[3764.16 - 3765.20] P:1758.59 E:0.076481 |  No, no, no, no.
[3765.20 - 3766.32] P:1807.93 E:0.099285 |  Brighton have.
[3766.32 - 3768.40] P:1868.12 E:0.088522 |  But no, Brighton played good football for years.
[3768.40 - 3770.08] P:1909.69 E:0.096300 |  I'm not saying that, but I'm saying,
[3770.08 - 3772.72] P:1984.87 E:0.087551 |  he looks like he's played at a level that...
[3773.36 - 3775.60] P:1965.95 E:0.101699 |  The top level for three or four years?
[3775.60 - 3777.44] P:1996.25 E:0.096072 |  He's been absolutely outrageous.
[3778.24 - 3779.84] P:1925.16 E:0.073384 |  I think what they've done well there,
[3779.84 - 3781.60] P:1922.85 E:0.099715 |  and what Liam Elmessi has done well,
[3781.60 - 3783.92] P:1840.39 E:0.082630 |  is that he stood in front of Teo and Ernest,
[3783.92 - 3785.44] P:1995.54 E:0.064611 |  and just...
[3785.44 - 3787.52] P:1931.30 E:0.093744 |  It's taken Rabio out of the game,
[3787.52 - 3790.88] P:1899.69 E:0.098455 |  that he's had to stand in front and protect that ball in.
[3791.44 - 3793.52] P:1739.24 E:0.090374 |  And Teo Mane's looked lost in there, hasn't he?
[3793.52 - 3795.52] P:1835.29 E:0.087143 |  Because it's such a hard task against that.
[3795.52 - 3797.28] P:1726.65 E:0.112030 |  Yeah, completely, and I think Julian Alvarez,
[3797.28 - 3798.80] P:1902.70 E:0.080501 |  who again we mentioned,
[3798.80 - 3800.48] P:1828.03 E:0.094143 |  slightly quickly before the game,
[3800.48 - 3802.32] P:1950.64 E:0.098048 |  is doing an amazing job on Truamene,
[3802.32 - 3803.44] P:1844.82 E:0.097636 |  cutting those passes.
[3804.08 - 3806.24] P:1757.69 E:0.086063 |  And the runs and the press,
[3806.24 - 3808.24] P:1834.15 E:0.091518 |  I don't know if people can see on television,
[3808.24 - 3809.28] P:1592.70 E:0.093668 |  for them watching on television,
[3809.28 - 3811.68] P:1860.18 E:0.091339 |  but from here, Alvarez is just a machine,
[3811.68 - 3813.44] P:1716.15 E:0.091549 |  he's incredible, and everything,
[3813.44 - 3814.64] P:1683.99 E:0.095283 |  every time someone has the ball,
[3814.64 - 3816.96] P:1842.33 E:0.091686 |  there's not a second before Alvarez comes,
[3816.96 - 3820.24] P:1824.69 E:0.087311 |  and presses and hassles him, and it's just fantastic,
[3820.24 - 3821.60] P:1799.43 E:0.102325 |  and he does exactly that on Truamene,
[3821.60 - 3824.24] P:1902.01 E:0.085017 |  and I think Truamene didn't expect it.
[3824.24 - 3825.52] P:1526.98 E:0.089807 |  And that's the thing again,
[3825.52 - 3828.56] P:1755.29 E:0.096118 |  we thought maybe Messi and Alvarez would play on their run-up front,
[3828.56 - 3830.08] P:1757.51 E:0.100449 |  and there would be a bit more time for Truamene,
[3830.08 - 3832.08] P:1871.99 E:0.092028 |  but the fact that they play with the front three,
[3832.08 - 3835.12] P:1931.60 E:0.089339 |  and Alvarez is clearly sticking on Truamene,
[3835.12 - 3836.24] P:1700.14 E:0.091008 |  is a big problem for us.
[3836.24 - 3838.48] P:1871.86 E:0.115139 |  But are we being harsh on Teo Mane?
[3838.48 - 3841.28] P:1985.66 E:0.097254 |  But because he's getting exposed in there,
[3841.28 - 3842.80] P:1816.04 E:0.103690 |  but they're getting outnumbered in there,
[3842.80 - 3845.76] P:1817.15 E:0.099468 |  McAllister made that good run for the goal on the right-hand side,
[3845.76 - 3848.64] P:1849.57 E:0.097029 |  but he's playing quite high up on the left-hand side.
[3848.64 - 3851.20] P:1843.54 E:0.094598 |  Couldn't they can't come in with McAllister,
[3851.20 - 3853.04] P:1845.51 E:0.104640 |  because he has to occupy Di Maria,
[3853.04 - 3854.72] P:1824.77 E:0.090583 |  so that's the French problem.
[3854.72 - 3856.80] P:1801.22 E:0.087730 |  And then two minutes getting dragged.
[3856.80 - 3859.52] P:1798.49 E:0.105724 |  OK, we're going to be harsh on the newsreader in a minute,
[3859.52 - 3862.48] P:1871.59 E:0.095656 |  because we won't get the news in before the second half starts.
[3862.48 - 3863.76] P:1949.19 E:0.100951 |  By the way, just one thing,
[3863.76 - 3867.44] P:1911.91 E:0.094789 |  when Kelly talked about it getting feisty towards the end of the first half,
[3867.44 - 3869.52] P:1880.25 E:0.097137 |  she was actually talking about up here,
[3869.52 - 3871.68] P:1850.14 E:0.091433 |  because that French commentator in front of us,
[3871.68 - 3874.64] P:1942.34 E:0.090910 |  she has stood up for the whole 45 minutes,
[3874.64 - 3877.84] P:1928.52 E:0.087290 |  and Kelly's close to chining her at the moment,
[3877.84 - 3878.96] P:1801.73 E:0.105959 |  I'll be honest with you.
[3878.96 - 3879.52] P:1763.31 E:0.085485 |  Oh, I'm with you.
[3879.52 - 3881.28] P:1782.95 E:0.112812 |  She's like our very own Paredes.
[3881.76 - 3883.60] P:1743.09 E:0.108153 |  I can't see who that is.
[3883.60 - 3885.12] P:1910.81 E:0.096609 |  Well, I love the words.
[3885.12 - 3886.16] P:2031.40 E:0.065499 |  Thanks, Jules.
[3886.16 - 3886.64] P:1775.35 E:0.091414 |  Merci.
[3887.84 - 3891.36] P:1743.65 E:0.091195 |  He's spreading vicious and untrue rumors about me.
[3891.36 - 3894.16] P:1814.56 E:0.103538 |  I'll be in touch with HR at the end of this one.
[3894.16 - 3896.00] P:1751.98 E:0.100575 |  I'll share, as they call it in France.
[3899.04 - 3900.32] P:1625.62 E:0.121734 |  Alexis McAllister is there,
[3900.32 - 3902.16] P:1608.71 E:0.100006 |  taking up a lot of the conversation this halftime.
[3902.16 - 3904.08] P:1797.45 E:0.081853 |  He becomes the first Brighton player
[3904.08 - 3905.52] P:1709.96 E:0.100966 |  to play at the World Cup final,
[3905.52 - 3907.28] P:1731.58 E:0.093648 |  and Sy Lloyd tweeted to say,
[3907.28 - 3910.64] P:1760.40 E:0.098270 |  I haven't seen a McAllister with so much freedom at this time of year,
[3910.72 - 3913.44] P:1724.28 E:0.103241 |  since Kevin's family decided to spend Christmas in Paris.
[3914.24 - 3916.08] P:1766.55 E:0.108119 |  We'll bring you the second half with Argentina,
[3916.08 - 3919.20] P:1612.82 E:0.102154 |  two nil up against France in the World Cup final after the BBC News.
[3920.40 - 3922.96] P:1408.49 E:0.125256 |  Listen on BBC Sounds.
[3922.96 - 3925.92] P:1497.75 E:0.123205 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3926.56 - 3927.04] P:1868.72 E:0.056734 |  Thank you, Kelly.
[3927.04 - 3928.64] P:1595.71 E:0.087818 |  With the headlines, I'm Stuart Clarkson.
[3928.64 - 3930.96] P:1709.19 E:0.105573 |  A man has been charged with an immigration offence
[3930.96 - 3932.00] P:1283.38 E:0.097558 |  after four people died
[3932.00 - 3935.28] P:1823.08 E:0.094219 |  when their dinghy capsized in the English Channel on Wednesday.
[3935.28 - 3938.40] P:1810.50 E:0.098401 |  19-year-old Ibrahima Barr is due in court in Folkestone.
[3938.40 - 3940.56] P:1691.27 E:0.092429 |  Tomorrow, detectives are still working to identify
[3940.72 - 3941.76] P:2034.18 E:0.066676 |  the victims.
[3941.76 - 3944.80] P:1889.65 E:0.112455 |  A child body has been found during a search for human remains
[3944.80 - 3946.32] P:1818.44 E:0.106374 |  at a house in Birmingham.
[3946.32 - 3948.56] P:1793.28 E:0.100170 |  Police have been excavating a garden in Hansworth
[3948.56 - 3951.60] P:1700.08 E:0.103172 |  after receiving information about a possible death two years ago.
[3951.60 - 3954.88] P:1936.30 E:0.090580 |  A man and a woman in their early 40s have been charged with neglect.
[3954.88 - 3956.64] P:1904.50 E:0.095546 |  The government has rejected the latest calls
[3956.64 - 3958.96] P:1798.57 E:0.090674 |  to increase public sector pay above inflation
[3958.96 - 3960.56] P:2098.28 E:0.092647 |  ahead of more strikes this week.
[3960.56 - 3962.00] P:1847.45 E:0.094280 |  Members of the Royal College of Nursing
[3962.00 - 3963.84] P:1594.35 E:0.103815 |  are due to walk out again in England, Wales,
[3963.84 - 3965.68] P:1896.00 E:0.105029 |  and Northern Ireland on Tuesday.
[3965.68 - 3969.76] P:1799.08 E:0.101744 |  Ministers say the 19% pay rise demanded is unaffordable
[3969.76 - 3972.56] P:1905.90 E:0.085641 |  and that they have a duty to keep finances under control.
[3972.56 - 3973.76] P:1917.33 E:0.099662 |  And the head of the armed forces,
[3973.76 - 3976.40] P:1674.00 E:0.117293 |  meanwhile, says military personnel should not be regarded
[3976.40 - 3978.72] P:1968.65 E:0.092267 |  as spare capacity for striking workers.
[3978.72 - 3980.80] P:1864.66 E:0.083941 |  The government has confirmed that 1,200 troops
[3980.80 - 3983.12] P:1867.33 E:0.087771 |  and 1,000 civil servants will be drafted in
[3983.12 - 3986.56] P:1790.45 E:0.086481 |  to cover for striking ambulance and border force staff around Christmas.
[3987.20 - 3990.80] P:1207.71 E:0.132413 |  BBC Five Live, The FIFA World Cup,
[3990.80 - 3995.12] P:1285.37 E:0.124826 |  Qatar 2022 with Mark Chapman and Kelly Cates.
[3996.00 - 3997.52] P:1698.75 E:0.105793 |  Teams are back out for the second half.
[3997.52 - 3999.36] P:1817.07 E:0.095928 |  Just a couple of other quick bits of news.
[3999.36 - 4002.80] P:1772.66 E:0.091922 |  The FA have confirmed that Kara Saaket will continue as England manager
[4002.80 - 4005.20] P:1892.29 E:0.087236 |  until after Euro 2024.
[4005.20 - 4009.04] P:1787.01 E:0.091116 |  And Pakistan ended day two of the third test on 21 without loss.
[4009.04 - 4012.32] P:1825.93 E:0.089617 |  England earlier scored 354.
[4012.32 - 4018.72] P:1853.35 E:0.086989 |  Said a lead by 29 runs commentary on our sports section from 4.45 tomorrow morning.
[4018.72 - 4021.12] P:1829.32 E:0.092284 |  If you go to the iPlayer, you can find World Cup extra.
[4021.12 - 4023.92] P:1828.08 E:0.086018 |  You can watch the pictures from BBC One,
[4023.92 - 4027.76] P:1775.47 E:0.088748 |  but listen to our commentary and you'll be very pleased to know
[4027.76 - 4034.08] P:1827.71 E:0.085986 |  that a diplomatic incident was avoided thanks to the negotiating skills
[4034.08 - 4036.24] P:1811.33 E:0.080667 |  bizarrely of Chris Sutton.
[4036.24 - 4041.60] P:1818.05 E:0.086387 |  The commentator in front has indeed Assein Foud.
[4042.32 - 4043.04] P:1615.65 E:0.116048 |  Ian Dennis.
[4044.72 - 4046.64] P:1727.56 E:0.097283 |  Thank you, Mark. About to get underway.
[4046.64 - 4049.68] P:1709.80 E:0.097672 |  Another side has made a change at the start then of this second half
[4049.68 - 4054.32] P:1762.48 E:0.086854 |  where Argentina are leading by two goals to nil.
[4055.04 - 4058.64] P:1657.36 E:0.098785 |  And if you recall when they played the Netherlands in the quarterfinals,
[4058.64 - 4062.56] P:1726.29 E:0.091089 |  that was the first time that Argentina when they were two up
[4062.56 - 4064.32] P:1765.75 E:0.097450 |  and they were pegged back by the Dutch.
[4065.20 - 4068.24] P:1749.25 E:0.098068 |  That was the first time in World Cup history that they failed to win.
[4068.24 - 4074.64] P:1676.10 E:0.083941 |  So that gives you the size and the task that a face is France here in Lussel.
[4075.44 - 4080.48] P:1639.06 E:0.093965 |  Although of course the success to the Dutch was to leave on the big or bring on the big man in
[4080.56 - 4086.96] P:1711.53 E:0.097602 |  Valtvegghorst and France have taken off their big man in Olivier Giroud
[4087.60 - 4091.92] P:1656.47 E:0.093515 |  with a couple of changes that they made in the in the first half.
[4091.92 - 4097.92] P:1760.65 E:0.103690 |  But Argentina well worth a 2-0 lead as Alvarez picks up the ball and runs forward from Messi's pass.
[4097.92 - 4102.00] P:1725.51 E:0.102599 |  It goes out towards to Paul just outside the penalty area back towards Alvarez,
[4102.00 - 4103.04] P:1638.52 E:0.098563 |  right corner of the box.
[4103.68 - 4106.64] P:1683.11 E:0.108601 |  Now he goes into a central area played forward by Fernandez,
[4106.64 - 4111.36] P:1805.88 E:0.110596 |  but Cališta was almost there and Hugo Lloris diving forward all in yellow.
[4111.36 - 4113.84] P:1791.44 E:0.087028 |  Haven't even had chance to give you the two teams.
[4113.84 - 4117.04] P:1683.93 E:0.101252 |  Emi Martinez is in goal for Argentina.
[4117.04 - 4119.76] P:1685.84 E:0.096142 |  Molina Romero, Ottoman Italy Fico,
[4119.76 - 4126.88] P:1889.60 E:0.110744 |  McAllister Fernandez to Paul and Di Maria, Alvarez and Messi and France have Lloris in goal.
[4126.88 - 4134.32] P:1800.30 E:0.094618 |  Cunde Uppamikano, Veram Teo Hernandez, Griezmann, Schuemeni Rabio and Bafi Tiram and Kohler Muwadi.
[4134.56 - 4140.00] P:1711.42 E:0.093904 |  I would have thought at halftime, did he, the shot would have read the French team the right act
[4140.00 - 4143.04] P:1678.51 E:0.091277 |  and talked about starting fast and Cunde switched off there.
[4143.84 - 4145.92] P:1557.28 E:0.107882 |  And McAllister nearly got on the end of it.
[4146.80 - 4149.68] P:1643.08 E:0.091716 |  Fernandez pass from the central area.
[4151.36 - 4157.52] P:1744.34 E:0.100492 |  Also with the Giroud departure, it means that the record of Nils Lidholm of Sweden
[4158.32 - 4163.04] P:1650.96 E:0.101030 |  remains intact to become the oldest ever goal scorer in a World Cup final.
[4165.20 - 4169.76] P:1722.30 E:0.105109 |  As Tuer Mene, back with Veram, but they've got it all to do, France, and they've got to
[4170.88 - 4174.64] P:1548.03 E:0.100390 |  they've got to really put in a vastly improved display in this second period, Rob Green.
[4174.64 - 4177.28] P:1681.03 E:0.102254 |  Yeah, we can talk about tactics, you can talk about whatever you want,
[4177.28 - 4181.52] P:1717.26 E:0.093100 |  but they sleptwalk through that first half to a 2-0 deficit.
[4181.52 - 4184.24] P:1626.17 E:0.099419 |  They've just got to wake up, they've got to liven up,
[4184.24 - 4190.32] P:1794.86 E:0.100993 |  they've got to ask a different question and Bap is now demanding it off his player, shouting his teammate.
[4190.32 - 4192.80] P:1771.08 E:0.103444 |  He's got to get on the ball and get in the game.
[4193.36 - 4196.16] P:1683.91 E:0.102224 |  Here is Veram, to Upper McCarno.
[4197.04 - 4200.08] P:1735.08 E:0.107581 |  The noise levels haven't changed, we're still surrounded by
[4201.60 - 4206.88] P:1747.12 E:0.103218 |  joyous Argentinians as a lot of the the corporate seats are still yet to be filled over on that
[4207.44 - 4213.68] P:1749.10 E:0.094705 |  far side, but Argentina leading by two goals to nil.
[4213.68 - 4217.60] P:1704.14 E:0.095465 |  And the second goal as well was just a goal of pure beauty.
[4217.60 - 4221.60] P:1630.06 E:0.099120 |  McAllister to Messi who just tickled it around the corner to Alvarez.
[4221.60 - 4227.84] P:1742.31 E:0.098969 |  McAllister continued his run breaking through and then unselfishly spread the ball to Dimaria.
[4229.12 - 4236.24] P:1611.71 E:0.101967 |  It was a stunning second goal from Argentina and early in the second half here on BBC Radio 5 Live
[4236.24 - 4242.48] P:1823.91 E:0.101310 |  and BBC Sounds or indeed taking up the option that Mark Chapman had said to watch on BBC One
[4242.48 - 4249.04] P:1781.30 E:0.097906 |  and listen to the 5 Live commentary that is also available to you through World Cup Extra on the
[4249.36 - 4254.64] P:1618.15 E:0.098664 |  iPlayer, but Argentina in their white and sky blue striped shirts and white shorts are playing
[4254.64 - 4258.88] P:1630.34 E:0.090516 |  from right to left and were four minutes into the second half.
[4259.52 - 4264.56] P:1670.67 E:0.102036 |  It's a direct throw and now it falls to the feet of around the edge of the area back towards
[4264.56 - 4266.72] P:1647.18 E:0.107713 |  Larisse, clears it away all in yellow.
[4267.36 - 4274.56] P:1794.11 E:0.093002 |  Talia Fico will get there first before Colin Mouane who tries to get some support from
[4275.52 - 4276.32] P:1888.10 E:0.106763 |  Kunde.
[4278.24 - 4283.52] P:1857.19 E:0.109136 |  Babbling for every loose ball but it's Kunde who brings it away and goes inside but stepping forward
[4283.52 - 4288.88] P:1735.35 E:0.104715 |  with Romero. Excellent defending there towards Messi and now towards Dimaria, left corner of the
[4288.88 - 4294.48] P:1762.00 E:0.107838 |  area. Dimaria crosses it, go into the ground with DePaul right footed saved by Larisse.
[4294.48 - 4296.16] P:1903.20 E:0.105095 |  The next goal is crucial in this game.
[4296.56 - 4302.64] P:1701.26 E:0.097692 |  Oh absolutely, Argentina get it, it's absolutely game over as in what a spot from D. Maria
[4303.60 - 4307.76] P:1748.27 E:0.107833 |  to DePaul, 16 yards out of the angle, choked his ball into the floor.
[4308.56 - 4312.72] P:1837.87 E:0.096896 |  And Bapé picks it up, slides forward, helped out by Griezmann,
[4314.32 - 4319.28] P:1817.93 E:0.112665 |  but the desire levels from Argentina you can see they do not want to give
[4319.84 - 4321.92] P:1643.96 E:0.101278 |  Francis Sniff of getting back into this game.
[4321.92 - 4323.84] P:1618.67 E:0.093527 |  No, they must have just heard you don't know.
[4323.84 - 4326.64] P:1654.21 E:0.100768 |  That next goal being so important but I'd love to see
[4327.20 - 4330.56] P:1691.24 E:0.103848 |  Stapman Dave call some ground duels where they are on the pitch because
[4331.28 - 4334.56] P:1655.54 E:0.103424 |  the majority nearly all are in the France half.
[4334.56 - 4338.48] P:1585.52 E:0.095468 |  They're on the front foot, they're stepping forward into the opponent's half whether they've
[4338.48 - 4342.00] P:1573.27 E:0.091424 |  got the ball or not. It's been so aggressive with them without the ball.
[4342.88 - 4347.20] P:1700.02 E:0.111056 |  At the Calico International Stadium yesterday for the third place playoff there was a number of
[4347.20 - 4352.00] P:1667.57 E:0.102271 |  players both in Croatia and Morocco that were going down in the end with muscle injuries.
[4352.00 - 4357.36] P:1759.30 E:0.108423 |  Just the fatigue back at the end of what has been a really intense 29 day period.
[4358.00 - 4363.44] P:1676.63 E:0.108482 |  And when you think that Messi was feeling his hamstring in the semi-final he's still
[4363.44 - 4368.96] P:1728.56 E:0.099944 |  charging around here. No one was going to want to come off this field for the Argentinian course.
[4368.96 - 4374.88] P:1467.37 E:0.097083 |  Can you believe we've just had a foul throw from Rabiot World Cup final.
[4375.92 - 4377.28] P:1532.21 E:0.096155 |  A little bit embarrassing isn't it?
[4378.40 - 4379.84] P:1481.34 E:0.124507 |  What you're going to say is better than that.
[4380.88 - 4381.38] P:1439.71 E:0.115191 |  Yes.
[4381.94 - 4386.90] P:1726.00 E:0.097292 |  Here is Telya Ficke up left hand side forward looking towards
[4386.90 - 4391.78] P:1725.36 E:0.100487 |  McAllister. There is McAllister what a fine game he's had for Brighton and
[4391.78 - 4397.78] P:1794.84 E:0.105617 |  Hobalby. For Argentinian and Hobalby in the field there is Mbappe now but there is Fernandez
[4397.78 - 4403.46] P:1828.13 E:0.108165 |  running back tracking him every move. The last touch came off Fernandez he's on a yellow card.
[4403.46 - 4408.98] P:1726.33 E:0.103046 |  Words are just being said there between Romero and Mbappe. The Polish referee is quickly on hand
[4408.98 - 4415.62] P:1771.21 E:0.102112 |  on that. The diplomatic incident might have to be we might have to go back for a second round of talks
[4416.42 - 4421.46] P:1995.33 E:0.108006 |  because the French commentators decided to sit stand up once again as Griesman
[4422.42 - 4429.86] P:1873.37 E:0.110471 |  with the corner kick on this near side. Griesman it's an in-swinger. Good hands from Mbappe Martinez-Rov.
[4430.42 - 4436.66] P:1737.00 E:0.096483 |  Beautiful ball for Akipa to take into the path. Nice height. The power of everyone's head nice and
[4436.66 - 4443.46] P:1658.94 E:0.091278 |  clearly can set the ball away straight away. Argentina on the attack. Argentina with Messi plays
[4443.46 - 4450.02] P:1797.04 E:0.106730 |  the ball out towards De Paul. De Paul can't get past the sliding challenge of Teo Hernandez
[4451.78 - 4460.02] P:1689.76 E:0.110148 |  and it will be is it a corner or a throw over on that far side in front of the
[4460.02 - 4467.70] P:1734.15 E:0.097336 |  mass hordes of Argentinian support. They're not sitting down. They're standing up the cheering the
[4467.70 - 4474.66] P:1626.03 E:0.105411 |  jumping and waving anything that is white or sky blue. It's a throw down by the corner flag.
[4474.66 - 4479.94] P:1566.99 E:0.097677 |  Molina is going to take it seven minutes into the second half five live and BBC sounds here
[4479.94 - 4489.30] P:1719.65 E:0.107074 |  and now indeed they do get a corner kick. It's so superior. De Paul he's had a tremendous game so far
[4490.02 - 4498.50] P:1674.29 E:0.115138 |  he's all action isn't he. He's narrow off that right hand side. I think they're to nullify the
[4498.50 - 4502.58] P:1650.93 E:0.112289 |  threat of Mbappe in that first half playing off the left but Mbappe barely saw the ball.
[4504.02 - 4509.54] P:1630.13 E:0.112698 |  Argentina at the start of this second half or seven eight minutes in still the dominant team.
[4511.62 - 4517.38] P:1643.95 E:0.106569 |  Corner kick then that Messi is going to take in front of his adoring supporters
[4517.62 - 4524.26] P:1671.89 E:0.103131 |  in all areas of the stadium here in Lusail. He moves a little sound bike in preparation to
[4524.26 - 4530.10] P:1693.40 E:0.102181 |  take the corner kick far side the right wraps it in low headed out by Griezmann at that near post
[4531.30 - 4538.42] P:1650.45 E:0.097421 |  and Messi is ambling to take the throw. They are in no hurry and in fact he's just going to leave
[4538.42 - 4544.02] P:1802.09 E:0.112721 |  it for somebody else to take. They've got all the time in the world to soak up the atmosphere
[4544.74 - 4550.02] P:1839.69 E:0.109708 |  and soak in a score line that means they're heading for what would be a third World Cup triumph
[4550.02 - 4558.66] P:1704.72 E:0.098560 |  from their first since 1986. The throw is eventually taken. Alvarez tries to lay the ball back
[4559.54 - 4567.30] P:1622.76 E:0.098721 |  cleared away by the French defence picked up though by Otter Mending passes the ball back out
[4567.30 - 4575.54] P:1737.27 E:0.109254 |  towards Depaul to Mimartinez. Oh he sliced it come right out of his penalty area he's now
[4576.58 - 4580.82] P:1712.82 E:0.110863 |  screaming at Depaul he was midway through his own half and it was a complete miss kick
[4580.82 - 4585.14] P:1717.05 E:0.109091 |  but France were unable to take advantage. Up a Meccano now in the centre circle
[4587.22 - 4594.10] P:1802.26 E:0.111661 |  Rabiot takes over, Tua Mene lays it off to Upper Meccano and Mbappe's deep and he wants the ball
[4594.10 - 4600.26] P:1843.89 E:0.113404 |  to be beaten here he is. Nine minutes into the second half closed down by Messi breaks towards
[4600.26 - 4606.50] P:1697.23 E:0.103024 |  Tua Mene out towards that far side de l'air Teo Hernandez. That's a Tua Mene looking for the
[4606.50 - 4614.34] P:1753.35 E:0.109679 |  return ball cut out by Depaul. That's probably one of the first mistakes as Depaul was caught by
[4614.34 - 4620.66] P:1807.21 E:0.110643 |  Rabiot and the Polish referee Marciniak is going for a yellow and the French would feel that
[4620.74 - 4627.38] P:1739.08 E:0.110782 |  his books moment of fortune for Martinez in goal it came a long way
[4628.34 - 4632.66] P:1696.72 E:0.113505 |  it's just a collision in front of him that took his eye off the ball and he sliced it but
[4633.38 - 4638.10] P:1671.56 E:0.114271 |  when you tune him up those are the things that go for you tune him down and go against you.
[4639.54 - 4646.34] P:1541.77 E:0.110780 |  Here's Lucky Enzo Fernandez was loitering in the right area Fernandez to think he didn't start
[4646.34 - 4654.90] P:1590.67 E:0.092072 |  the first two games in this competition Scoloni put him into the team and he's playing in that sort
[4654.90 - 4661.70] P:1656.06 E:0.104118 |  of quarterback position as Depaul has stayed down really reckless challenge from Rabiot
[4663.30 - 4668.58] P:1617.87 E:0.110484 |  but want to lose him to Paul. Well he had been carrying a bit of a knock I think it was going
[4668.58 - 4674.34] P:1605.94 E:0.099815 |  into the the Netherlands game in the quarter finals the Atletico Madrid player but Enzo Fernandez
[4674.34 - 4678.10] P:1721.52 E:0.106008 |  has been linked with with Liverpool as you say started the last four games
[4679.38 - 4685.62] P:1736.91 E:0.105258 |  has appeared in every game at this tournament the 21 year old midfielder but has really become a
[4686.98 - 4693.30] P:1670.33 E:0.106752 |  a key player in that midfield for for Argentina with Depaul and McAllister and then Dymariah
[4694.02 - 4697.94] P:1740.87 E:0.111843 |  who's going to retire from the international stage after the world cup scored the winning
[4697.94 - 4704.50] P:1687.76 E:0.103714 |  goal against Brazil in the Coppa America and it's his goal that gives Argentina a cushion.
[4705.70 - 4710.58] P:1637.54 E:0.106977 |  A world cup incident that has never been won by winners of the Coppa America that could all

[4720.02 - 4726.74] P:1756.08 E:0.106539 |  as there was a challenge from Talia Fico on Colin Muani
[4727.46 - 4732.42] P:1805.36 E:0.102110 |  he's back to his feet but they're looking for a spark and at the minute that spark is not forthcoming.
[4732.42 - 4736.98] P:1788.41 E:0.101843 |  Well you look at Argentina you say we don't have to do anything spectacular at all we just need to
[4736.98 - 4744.74] P:1630.62 E:0.101811 |  sit tight and not make any mistakes because as you say they're absolutely void of any form of
[4745.22 - 4751.06] P:1676.53 E:0.101757 |  any form of cohesion on the ball and any form of pressure off it.
[4751.94 - 4753.38] P:1700.70 E:0.108502 |  It's been the French misconnection.
[4756.02 - 4756.90] P:1638.51 E:0.136273 |  Here is Cunde.
[4759.62 - 4764.34] P:1828.10 E:0.114131 |  Coming forward on this near side the right Dymariah goes to ground and slides Cunde tries to
[4764.34 - 4768.50] P:1751.21 E:0.108024 |  the middle of the cross closed down though by McAllister Dymariah keeps the ball in play
[4769.30 - 4774.10] P:1774.84 E:0.113490 |  Colin Muani now for France tries to get round the back strong challenge that was
[4774.18 - 4779.38] P:1794.68 E:0.112860 |  by Talia Fico there was no way that he was getting past the at the left back
[4780.26 - 4785.78] P:1661.14 E:0.111846 |  and France have got a throw that Cunde wants to take as we approach the hour mark here on BBC

[4817.22 - 4822.98] P:1558.76 E:0.099959 |  and Marcini at the referee will just want to have a word. That's the difference the urgency

[4836.42 - 4840.98] P:1761.47 E:0.114508 |  you're looking at France and how they're attacking then they're doing it as individuals

[4845.22 - 4850.50] P:1631.63 E:0.102707 |  he's just he's just running with the ball on his own there's no there's no options there to pass

[4959.06 - 4964.58] P:1688.57 E:0.113062 |  enabled it to to run through towards Messi that could have been the goal to seal it
[4965.30 - 4970.18] P:1610.05 E:0.115142 |  oh they're playing with such swag as such confidence de Maria down that left hand side a couple of

[5017.30 - 5024.10] P:1675.30 E:0.102960 |  caused a few late nerves we know what the Dutch did when they scrambled and salvaged it from 2-0

[5045.86 - 5051.14] P:1757.21 E:0.096039 |  minute and there's very little to come off the bench now for France now that they've made the
[5051.14 - 5057.46] P:1821.01 E:0.101662 |  two attacking subs but they didn't have it they don't have an identity France but
[5058.42 - 5062.34] P:1795.03 E:0.105307 |  they haven't really got any fire in the belly where's the France fire Deno
[5063.54 - 5067.30] P:1856.79 E:0.108733 |  but at the moment it hasn't even been lit as Ravio comes forward
[5069.22 - 5075.78] P:1832.73 E:0.103047 |  and now it's an opportunity for Turan to Griezmann out to and to Mbappe and Mbappe left

[5112.74 - 5117.62] P:1772.00 E:0.108856 |  and there was lens into him preventing him from getting the shot away
[5118.34 - 5125.06] P:1721.30 E:0.097734 |  that was it wasn't quite the same but that was a little bit like the uh the Hernandez one on

[5136.66 - 5141.30] P:1623.69 E:0.116814 |  it was a risk but the fact that play is already underway means that BAR would have had a look
[5141.30 - 5148.26] P:1675.43 E:0.105775 |  and they quickly dismissed it 63 minutes play Argentina still lead two goals to nil Ravio

[5318.26 - 5324.58] P:1630.48 E:0.110008 |  grabio out to Griezmann Griezmann delivers the cross and it was a dangerous ball to from that left

[5337.06 - 5341.78] P:1835.65 E:0.093857 |  and then it's dug out by the Callister that really was a wicked ball Chris
[5341.78 - 5348.50] P:1746.16 E:0.102641 |  up brilliant from Griezmann out on that left hand touch line whipped the ball in left footed
[5349.06 - 5356.42] P:1756.11 E:0.100222 |  and Durand and Mouane on the heels didn't gamble weren't proactive the ball

[5365.70 - 5371.30] P:1705.95 E:0.109066 |  so really well we never know Griezmann back out towards the left hand side another dangerous

[5378.02 - 5386.26] P:1804.78 E:0.111353 |  France have that corner on the left hand side which Griezmann is going to take

[5393.94 - 5398.42] P:1764.68 E:0.109949 |  but they are now in comes the corner and it goes out of play for a gold kick
[5398.50 - 5403.78] P:1746.05 E:0.103086 |  we're midway through the second half don't go anywhere just to save the atmosphere
[5403.78 - 5410.58] P:1688.07 E:0.104316 |  even if there are no more goals it's Argentina 2, Frans Niel live on five life and here's that

[5421.46 - 5426.82] P:1682.16 E:0.106326 |  and France are going to make another double change if you weren't listening earlier did he a day shop
[5427.38 - 5433.22] P:1709.07 E:0.101206 |  so serious was the situation for his team he made a double change in the 41st minute
[5433.22 - 5439.38] P:1635.39 E:0.098892 |  and now he's going to bring on Jung Kammervinger the Real Madrid midfielder or left back as he's
[5440.02 - 5446.50] P:1775.15 E:0.095215 |  been for France here and also Kingsley Coleman is coming on as Chris suggested he might do
[5446.50 - 5452.18] P:1676.54 E:0.097198 |  although Coleman has been one of the players who was named as struggling with this virus that's
[5452.18 - 5459.78] P:1706.37 E:0.100313 |  been in the french squad this week so it is Argentina 2, Frans Niel and we have less than a
[5459.78 - 5467.62] P:1597.33 E:0.097098 |  quarter of this world cup final here in Qatar to go and here is Messi playing it back into his own
[5467.62 - 5475.38] P:1686.44 E:0.104691 |  half and the two frenchmen are limbering up on the halfway line I noticed as well that the referee
[5475.38 - 5481.62] P:1796.50 E:0.097899 |  has actually told the Argentine substitute to are on the bench to calm down good luck with that
[5484.34 - 5489.38] P:1800.07 E:0.106588 |  France win a free kick 10 yards inside the the Argentine half they were going to make a change
[5489.38 - 5493.22] P:1747.92 E:0.103452 |  there but they're taking a quick free kick everything is so urgent now for France. Teo
[5493.22 - 5498.34] P:1715.73 E:0.092803 |  Hernandez with a cross on the left hand side but cleared away by Romero unflappable clearance from
[5498.34 - 5504.98] P:1683.68 E:0.106711 |  the top defender and Alvarez is dispossessed on the halfway line France have improved in the
[5504.98 - 5511.38] P:1731.02 E:0.097041 |  second half but but they have to and now Turan down the line Marcus Turan into the full back
[5511.38 - 5518.50] P:1809.19 E:0.109003 |  position Molina puts in the challenge in comes support as well from to Paul and the ball's
[5518.50 - 5524.18] P:1735.16 E:0.106124 |  caught up as he goes to ground and Teo Hernandez was in there but Argentina have come out with it
[5524.18 - 5530.10] P:1833.79 E:0.103204 |  and to Paul raises forward but the the defender is there to play it all the way back to goalkeeper
[5530.10 - 5533.86] P:1763.73 E:0.105234 |  Loris this is five live we have Rob Green and Chris Sutton with us here in the commentary
[5533.86 - 5539.06] P:1733.28 E:0.091053 |  position in the stadium Rob yeah just Argentina levels have dropped and it's understandable
[5539.06 - 5546.18] P:1622.49 E:0.080624 |  they've been going 70 minutes now and everything on the line and eventually France have managed to
[5546.18 - 5550.10] P:1709.05 E:0.097364 |  string some passes together get some bodies forward and get them together in numbers
[5550.66 - 5556.66] P:1691.52 E:0.095042 |  reasonable to try and define spaces that he was so quiet in the first half but Argentina
[5556.66 - 5562.42] P:1617.48 E:0.096579 |  were just dominant and they lead through those two first half goals the messy penalty and the goal
[5562.50 - 5570.26] P:1754.45 E:0.105333 |  the counterattack from Di Maria France could still be interesting but Mbappe does so well
[5570.26 - 5577.06] P:1937.08 E:0.099181 |  and shoots right footed from just inside the box a dancing run from Mbappe we've seen so little
[5577.06 - 5581.78] P:1958.78 E:0.097500 |  of that that the shot was high over the top of the crossbar Chris Sutton yeah Larm Bells
[5582.98 - 5589.38] P:1669.54 E:0.097201 |  Argentina the first time Mbappe off that left hand side moved out there in this second half
[5589.70 - 5596.66] P:1599.22 E:0.098377 |  drove on the inside but on that devastating right foot of his but just off balance and
[5596.66 - 5605.06] P:1710.08 E:0.093635 |  scooped his shot 18 yards over the bar and that's it the Griezmann Griezmann's been substituted
[5605.06 - 5610.74] P:1697.41 E:0.095638 |  so it's Geru and Dan Bally off in the first half Griezmann off in the second and Theo Hernandez
[5611.38 - 5616.90] P:1645.26 E:0.092408 |  also makes way so Camel Vinga has gone across to play it left back again he is not left back
[5616.90 - 5623.14] P:1591.91 E:0.092952 |  he is an excellent sensory fielder a real prospect but for a man who's had such a fantastic
[5623.14 - 5629.78] P:1775.72 E:0.088293 |  tournament it's been such a difficult performance tonight starved of any form of ball any form of
[5629.78 - 5637.70] P:1725.22 E:0.090783 |  support for Griezmann Argentina coming forward so Corman and Camel Vinga along as a second four
[5637.70 - 5642.26] P:1722.99 E:0.098948 |  years time when we're watching the World Cup all being well that Camel Vinga will be operating in
[5642.26 - 5648.98] P:1831.82 E:0.100094 |  the middle of the French midfield he has Messi on the left hand side Messi little steps still going
[5648.98 - 5654.26] P:1805.38 E:0.102603 |  turns away from Kunde gives it back Fernandez right foot shot the too close to Laurie's who
[5654.26 - 5660.66] P:1777.29 E:0.087916 |  was able to quickly step to his left and pat the ball then yes sorry I was in the stadium he scored
[5660.66 - 5668.90] P:1753.65 E:0.094116 |  an absolute snonker against Mexico bent it into the far top corner from a more central position
[5668.98 - 5674.90] P:1664.96 E:0.093139 |  there but maybe just got them all stuck under his right foot a little bit trying to aim for that
[5674.90 - 5680.90] P:1741.38 E:0.099673 |  far corner but ended up just clipping it straight at Laurie's who was central so what are France
[5680.90 - 5690.42] P:1692.56 E:0.093637 |  doing now then with those changes Corman is on the right Rob and then Touran has taken up a forward
[5691.22 - 5697.22] P:1611.52 E:0.092778 |  position to the right of Mbappe and then Colomouane he's gone over to the left hand side
[5697.86 - 5704.18] P:1826.07 E:0.084798 |  basically four to four as many players forward as you can and hope if something comes off because
[5704.18 - 5711.62] P:1752.96 E:0.100712 |  that's all that's been so far is just hope well at 2-0 and it's been so comfortable for Argentina and
[5712.18 - 5717.94] P:1637.51 E:0.093710 |  and they've threatened quite regularly to get a third goal in the second half but it is still 2-0
[5717.94 - 5724.82] P:1744.83 E:0.095717 |  and we've got just over 15 minutes to play France get a goal well Martinez hasn't got shirt dirty
[5724.82 - 5731.30] P:1687.73 E:0.093421 |  yet he hasn't had to make the save in any form so I'll make two notes Rob for for France the
[5731.30 - 5735.54] P:1752.17 E:0.091943 |  header that Giroud put over early on in the match which was actually given as a foul against him
[5735.54 - 5738.90] P:1589.34 E:0.093270 |  which I didn't think was the right decision and then that Mbappe running from the left
[5738.90 - 5747.62] P:1716.53 E:0.097641 |  and the shot over the top that's it France with up on the car now carries the ball for it takes it
[5747.62 - 5751.78] P:1778.74 E:0.101953 |  on but then in steps Romero in Argentina as France tried to press forward and he's been
[5751.78 - 5756.74] P:1787.01 E:0.095968 |  fouled actually Romero as the challenge came in and from Colomouane I think it is and it's a
[5756.74 - 5764.02] P:1709.27 E:0.084814 |  free kick to Argentina and sensing Argentina the fact that France are setting themselves for a bit
[5764.02 - 5768.98] P:1655.31 E:0.092874 |  of an offensive here Argentina very clever here just to break things up slow things down
[5770.58 - 5778.58] P:1686.45 E:0.096051 |  and slow the game down no rush see it through I was toppling up John because I'm a little bit of
[5778.66 - 5784.02] P:1596.68 E:0.100748 |  a banana rack at times and I've been lonely this week with that Ali Bruce ball topping up shots on
[5784.66 - 5791.62] P:1630.20 E:0.093291 |  the Argentinian goal in this tournament only eight shots on their goal Martinez has been well
[5791.62 - 5796.02] P:1577.33 E:0.090131 |  protected there was just that period wasn't there in the in the game against the Netherlands where
[5796.02 - 5802.34] P:1545.19 E:0.084359 |  the Netherlands made a brutal brand of football went very direct put the young on and they're
[5802.34 - 5808.26] P:1465.42 E:0.097661 |  course on where they really struggled defensively rather than that Martinez has been protected
[5808.98 - 5817.06] P:1650.70 E:0.090647 |  superbly free kick Martinez to take this downfield five live from the BBC Argentina to France
[5817.06 - 5822.10] P:1781.76 E:0.097506 |  nil France come back with it and here is a mbappe down the left hand side trying to trying to use
[5822.10 - 5827.70] P:1793.02 E:0.103601 |  that pace that we know so well but across comes Romero and just takes the ball off his toe and
[5827.70 - 5834.02] P:1769.85 E:0.096479 |  Argentina can bring the ball forward with the ball and now he has one for alvarez to chase and
[5834.02 - 5838.18] P:1712.21 E:0.092877 |  alvarez is on to this defender is there with him up on mccano he's forced him out into the
[5838.18 - 5841.30] P:1746.83 E:0.097041 |  fullback position I thought for a moment there he was going to be past him but
[5841.30 - 5846.50] P:1746.76 E:0.087931 |  open mccano did well actually and recovered and was able to to snuff out that danger yeah really
[5846.50 - 5851.78] P:1805.74 E:0.106858 |  good defending in the end but alvarez was on his own so even if he had got there first and got clear
[5851.78 - 5857.30] P:1796.45 E:0.089290 |  there's a tight angle and very very difficult to make something of it from there as France
[5857.86 - 5863.54] P:2005.90 E:0.110992 |  passes the ball out of play and french heads go down again by the way if you aren't like

[6243.70 - 6250.50] P:1693.99 E:0.111729 |  from nowhere where has this come from and bapet has barely had a kick and it was messy who was
[6250.50 - 6254.98] P:1652.20 E:0.106034 |  robbed of the ball i think from coman they worked the ball into a central position
[6255.14 - 6264.42] P:1628.40 E:0.100133 |  and then i think it's a i think it's a bit of a give and go the ball's fed to rabeo opens his body
[6264.42 - 6272.10] P:1720.43 E:0.104490 |  up feeds it to him bapet you heads the ball down i think it's to to ram who then lifts the ball over

[6293.94 - 6300.02] P:1641.44 E:0.099078 |  two minutes but brought these games alive they were cruising every single little one of france
[6300.02 - 6306.18] P:1747.96 E:0.096404 |  subs has to be booked because they all sprinted across the pitch to celebrate with him bapet
[6306.66 - 6312.50] P:1703.62 E:0.099999 |  well referee martiniak ticked off the argentina bench he can't go and book all of the french
[6312.50 - 6319.22] P:1748.58 E:0.097210 |  substitutes they've all they're all gathering themselves didier daschamps reaction was incredible
[6319.22 - 6327.62] P:1714.15 E:0.096072 |  well what a world cup finals this has turned out to be two two an extra time decking and what did
[6327.62 - 6332.42] P:1632.55 E:0.096893 |  we say about argentina against the netherlands but we couldn't see it happening in this game
[6333.38 - 6339.78] P:1710.93 E:0.090910 |  but it just has we said do something different and there was nothing different about it but
[6339.78 - 6346.82] P:1660.61 E:0.097631 |  the softest of soft penalties and all of a sudden the dynamic change the belief changed in both things
[6347.70 - 6354.58] P:1690.15 E:0.101959 |  within 90 seconds i saw between the two goals the ambapé penalty and then his seventh at this
[6354.58 - 6360.90] P:1643.29 E:0.097555 |  world cup ambapé now leads the standings and kelly and ambapé have certainly stepped into
[6360.90 - 6365.30] P:1699.43 E:0.107256 |  this world cup and here's a kudnia on the left hand side for argentina and finanda shoots and that's
[6365.30 - 6371.30] P:1616.92 E:0.096520 |  blocked by upa mccano on the edge of the box and it looks like argentina if they're going to win it
[6371.30 - 6375.46] P:1545.33 E:0.104066 |  if they're going to take this world cup back to brenner sary's they're going to have to win this
[6375.46 - 6382.82] P:1767.03 E:0.102171 |  world cup final all over again and actually now the holders have got their tails up all the changes
[6382.82 - 6389.78] P:1730.12 E:0.100620 |  that didier daschamps made i mean it improved france but we did not see that coming well they're all
[6389.78 - 6394.26] P:1685.46 E:0.101173 |  over the place now tactically the shape's completely gone they've thrown everything to the win but
[6394.74 - 6400.74] P:1796.77 E:0.112094 |  and bapé's tail is up he's on a hat trick but at the moment the ball is being carried forward
[6400.74 - 6405.70] P:1785.19 E:0.110549 |  through the middle and it's given out to ambapé on the left hand side who crosses to the back post but
[6405.70 - 6416.18] P:1713.21 E:0.108772 |  it's just all to the top of paula and wani and behind for a gulkin to argentina what an incredible
[6416.90 - 6423.14] P:1665.83 E:0.105489 |  incredible match this is how france are back in this i really don't know you think about the
[6423.70 - 6429.22] P:1651.89 E:0.111788 |  the automand hesitation though to allow the ball to baron smuani to get the other side
[6430.02 - 6435.78] P:1615.13 E:0.107880 |  and then mesi who's been brilliant all evening hasn't he giving the ball away it's robbed of the ball
[6437.70 - 6444.18] P:1646.44 E:0.101289 |  but it's moments isn't it it's been a world cup of moments magic moments and ambapé's finish
[6444.98 - 6451.78] P:1719.42 E:0.100134 |  was absolutely stunning france win a free kick inside their own half it looked as though france
[6451.78 - 6456.26] P:1707.49 E:0.098921 |  were meekly heading to defeat we were talking about the virus that's bothered them all week
[6456.26 - 6462.10] P:1739.88 E:0.102428 |  didier daschamps made his changes and it looks as though didier daschamps changes might just have
[6462.10 - 6468.98] P:1704.36 E:0.101837 |  come up trumps chris yeah the last time i saw didier daschamps as excited as that job
[6469.78 - 6478.26] P:1643.40 E:0.103348 |  was when he turned over the king of hearts in a westland and hotel room there you go
[6479.78 - 6484.74] P:1682.74 E:0.105082 |  and you couldn't believe you look and you said didier you're better than that
[6486.26 - 6495.62] P:1707.76 E:0.105239 |  argentina to france too and he raised an eyebrow and he took the spoils and he might just he might
[6495.62 - 6500.02] P:1540.63 E:0.107645 |  just do it again he may have been thinking of me in that moment maybe he was chris
[6502.02 - 6508.42] P:1710.72 E:0.106265 |  well kunde now on the right hand side and it's ale la blaire inside the le sale stadium here and
[6508.42 - 6514.50] P:1808.99 E:0.097778 |  that's a foul by mccalista suddenly argentina are on the back foot france winner free kick there's no
[6514.50 - 6519.86] P:1851.01 E:0.101710 |  greasement on the field now though in terms of the set pieces there's two balls on the pitch and no
[6519.86 - 6525.62] P:1796.00 E:0.106957 |  was noticed that's um while this game is at the moment it's all instinctive from france they're
[6525.62 - 6532.34] P:1717.30 E:0.102500 |  just doing it on the hoop and just going for it and it's coming off he's all of a sudden a threat
[6532.34 - 6538.42] P:1761.60 E:0.099982 |  from everywhere well when they did win that world cup last time it was three two free kick is taken
[6538.42 - 6542.66] P:1691.46 E:0.101199 |  by france kunde and then bat eight the gatherer bounces to the edge of the argentina bot then
[6542.66 - 6548.18] P:1805.30 E:0.115542 |  headed forward by colo moane oh that could be a penalty no it's giving us a free kick the other way
[6548.18 - 6554.82] P:1759.93 E:0.104704 |  it's giving us a free kick to argentina and a yellow card is shown to rabbi oh well i mean the
[6555.38 - 6559.06] P:1696.91 E:0.111284 |  referee marchin that was was waving that card around it might have been to ram
[6560.10 - 6564.74] P:1708.96 E:0.099412 |  yeah to ram it was who i guess has been yellow carded but throwing himself down
[6566.10 - 6572.74] P:1717.26 E:0.099773 |  yep well the referee seemed pretty sure let's have a look yeah i think he's on his way down there
[6572.82 - 6579.38] P:1777.50 E:0.103380 |  to ram is he caught no he's better than that trace six oh six tonight oh yeah you don't need to
[6579.38 - 6584.90] P:1768.96 E:0.098041 |  worry about the simulation game there marcus two rams got that wrapped up oh i tell you what the
[6584.90 - 6590.74] P:1775.38 E:0.098020 |  water moment i think we initially thought he was caught but watching it back good decision
[6590.74 - 6597.38] P:1604.72 E:0.100783 |  from the referee the referee held his nerve well done referee marchin yeah very good decision
[6597.38 - 6605.30] P:1648.18 E:0.096043 |  very good spot the first tollish man to referee a world cup final and he's uh he's got a big tick
[6605.30 - 6610.58] P:1562.91 E:0.091801 |  in the book for that one and then there's been a clash of heads now on the far time far side that's a
[6610.58 - 6616.90] P:1658.66 E:0.091327 |  a stoppage in play and we will have the significant amount of time added on at the end of this match
[6617.54 - 6626.90] P:1652.90 E:0.098074 |  which almost goes without saying at this world cup it was raviol and alvarez who have come together
[6626.90 - 6634.34] P:1641.75 E:0.092956 |  so we'll have a stoppage now but what a what a 15 minutes that was it's incredible couple of
[6634.34 - 6641.94] P:1740.84 E:0.091893 |  moments and just feel these as christ touched on the first penalty the demaria penalty it was so soft
[6642.42 - 6648.26] P:1615.71 E:0.096040 |  that it kind of set marchin here the referee up to have to give that one because there was contact
[6648.26 - 6652.90] P:1720.86 E:0.096319 |  because he was the wrong side we're talking to premier league about a higher bar being in the
[6652.90 - 6658.26] P:1590.80 E:0.089040 |  penalty area it's not the case for either of those but there's no arguing about that second
[6658.26 - 6663.78] P:1633.81 E:0.105342 |  and bat a goal wow kelly and on bat payers very much come to the party and here he is walking
[6663.78 - 6668.34] P:1678.22 E:0.100650 |  across now and he's telling the french families actually behind the dugout to raise themselves
[6668.34 - 6673.54] P:1662.21 E:0.091439 |  and and give it give it some noise against all of these argentines and those two goals that he
[6673.54 - 6678.98] P:1680.26 E:0.093444 |  scored and bat is there's seven goals at this world cup but that for him now that's 11 goals
[6678.98 - 6688.42] P:1755.71 E:0.079650 |  at world cup so he's become the youngest to score 10 goals or more in world cup tournaments
[6688.42 - 6697.06] P:1678.89 E:0.092788 |  and he's also become the youngest man to score in two world cup finals scored in moscow in the
[6697.06 - 6702.58] P:1706.27 E:0.102843 |  four two win against creuisha four years ago and two goals in this world cup final and that was his
[6702.58 - 6711.30] P:1712.75 E:0.100783 |  two goals in kazan in the cooking pot which did for argentina at the last world cup
[6713.38 - 6716.02] P:1689.78 E:0.113859 |  so raviol just looking at him bat pay there what's going on there
[6718.10 - 6723.38] P:1610.68 E:0.110469 |  there's a little bit of something going on with uh remearo
[6724.34 - 6731.38] P:1674.37 E:0.107692 |  and finandes but that's calm down for the time being oh that's a that's a bit of a challenge
[6731.38 - 6736.90] P:1697.53 E:0.099111 |  by remearo isn't it on turan on the edge of the box and that's a free kick that is a free kick
[6736.90 - 6743.30] P:1705.42 E:0.090988 |  to france two or three paces outside the penalty out but he was awarded a free kick but he's not
[6743.30 - 6747.78] P:1722.43 E:0.093358 |  he's changed his mind throwing is taken full comes into the argentina penalty area and that's headed
[6747.78 - 6755.30] P:1670.34 E:0.095847 |  away by otamendi comes back for france and bat pay swings it high across the penalty area colman
[6755.30 - 6759.30] P:1717.99 E:0.103280 |  while he was limping he looked as though he might not be able to continue that's when it was two nil
[6760.02 - 6763.78] P:1649.07 E:0.103184 |  but things have changed since then and colman continues and we've got eight minutes of added
[6763.78 - 6770.90] P:1693.80 E:0.095661 |  time so could the extra time in the world cup final two two argentina would two nil up with
[6770.90 - 6776.26] P:1634.14 E:0.095173 |  ten minutes to play and france and bat pay have changed all that and colman now inland the challenge
[6776.26 - 6782.74] P:1728.25 E:0.095086 |  with mccallister roll bounces away up on mccarno forward a flick through the middle and bat pay
[6782.74 - 6787.54] P:1698.60 E:0.086717 |  gives it back to turan but and bat pay had come back from an offside position and it is a free
[6787.54 - 6793.70] P:1592.67 E:0.098737 |  kick to argentina for every ball into the argentina box now your heart's in your mouth you just think
[6794.66 - 6802.18] P:1530.26 E:0.102751 |  they're at sixes and sevens it just the game slowed down but the jeopardy is a knife edge now

[6909.78 - 6914.66] P:1678.01 E:0.105759 |  control in his shiny black shoes demonstrates that he was a little more than a water carrier
[6915.22 - 6920.90] P:1648.83 E:0.102301 |  and it's a throw in to argentina inside their own heart it's going to be a very interesting

[7027.86 - 7033.62] P:1632.48 E:0.100515 |  and uh he is saying that someone on the french bench i want you to come forward now
[7034.58 - 7040.34] P:1777.13 E:0.111509 |  and he shows him the yellow card it's jiru it's Olivier jiru who was called forward

[7063.06 - 7067.46] P:1826.79 E:0.114184 |  and now it is france coming forward and um bapme plays it through the middle and
[7067.46 - 7071.54] P:1811.86 E:0.107618 |  in comes the challenge on colum wanny and advances back to him bapme in the box on the
[7071.54 - 7076.74] P:1756.22 E:0.111782 |  left hand side ball rattling around they can't get it clear colum wanny goes down in the area
[7076.74 - 7084.58] P:1781.32 E:0.099476 |  and the referee says no penalty no penalty but last ditch last ditch heart in mouth
[7084.58 - 7091.46] P:1742.75 E:0.105421 |  defending from argentina there chris oh it was it somehow scrambled the ball to safety it looked
[7091.46 - 7097.38] P:1742.57 E:0.101265 |  like on a couple of occasions bwanny was going to break through he is messy at the other end though
[7097.38 - 7104.26] P:1760.74 E:0.095874 |  middle of a half still two minutes close to play akunya out to the left hand side the ball played
[7104.26 - 7110.10] P:1789.15 E:0.106749 |  in from the left flank from what a mendee of all people blocked inside the area then rabios
[7110.82 - 7115.70] P:1747.47 E:0.096368 |  and that was a desperate foul because argentina thought that france could be aware and chalia
[7115.70 - 7120.98] P:1755.08 E:0.095797 |  fico is quite fortunate not to be yellow carded for that oh all the shape has gone from this game
[7120.98 - 7126.34] P:1774.97 E:0.100432 |  and it feels completely gone it's just being bypassed which is great from our point of view
[7126.34 - 7133.22] P:1628.13 E:0.103452 |  suits and bapme down to the ground he is just saving himself waiting for those bursts those
[7133.22 - 7139.86] P:1640.17 E:0.103588 |  moments of energy those moments of just instinctive play between him and his teammates ball headed in
[7139.86 - 7146.42] P:1736.38 E:0.103817 |  field for france but cleared away by otter mendee argentina coming forward now argentina dominated
[7146.42 - 7153.62] P:1695.26 E:0.101380 |  the game for 80 minutes really akunya he has alvarez on the left hand side the manchester city
[7153.62 - 7159.94] P:1828.85 E:0.110446 |  youngster to depot and now square to messy and messy on the edge of the d leford shot saved by loris
[7159.94 - 7165.86] P:1762.69 E:0.105903 |  leaping to his right what a moment that was and it was kept out by the flying french captain
[7166.82 - 7173.78] P:1715.81 E:0.101556 |  it's a corner and that was the moment i think once messy drops inside two french defenders
[7173.78 - 7181.38] P:1732.63 E:0.092592 |  and gets the ball onto his left foot you're thinking goal what a save from loris romp flying to his
[7181.38 - 7188.90] P:1651.93 E:0.102077 |  right hand side big left hand he's just had a little bit of deeper last minute moment movement
[7188.90 - 7195.62] P:1687.21 E:0.100021 |  to his left hand side it's caught the left wrist as it's gone over the bar but everyone was up
[7195.94 - 7202.90] P:1728.93 E:0.093465 |  commentators are out crowd are off loris was up as well what a world cup final this is turning out
[7202.90 - 7209.94] P:1693.68 E:0.091288 |  to be how dramatic how unexpectedly dramatic it's two two we're heading into extra time but
[7209.94 - 7214.98] P:1790.43 E:0.103059 |  argentina have a corner messy plays it in it's headed away in the opposed and now colman is fouled
[7214.98 - 7220.02] P:1834.67 E:0.105782 |  colman is fouled as he was bringing it forward that has to be a yellow card it is for akunya
[7220.02 - 7225.14] P:1686.99 E:0.095894 |  and that was blatant from him and uh france have a free kick but they would have been away
[7226.42 - 7233.22] P:1685.32 E:0.095828 |  they was 3v3 with him batting away and no one was catching him that is the best foul of this world cup
[7236.26 - 7242.10] P:1806.93 E:0.112686 |  two two five live from the bbc all those argentina fans are sitting rather
[7242.10 - 7247.06] P:1739.81 E:0.108398 |  uncomfortably as the spectator first is sitting quite uncomfortably as well the only man who
[7247.06 - 7251.46] P:1735.85 E:0.104244 |  have scored a hat trick in a world cup final here's colman down the right hand side colman's
[7251.46 - 7256.50] P:1788.73 E:0.097289 |  away from the callister colman with the cross it takes a double bounce of argentina players inside
[7256.50 - 7261.30] P:1678.14 E:0.098503 |  their own penalty area but bounces out of the box and messy now takes it up inside his own half
[7261.30 - 7266.18] P:1886.38 E:0.112415 |  deep inside his own half finds a brilliant pass forward to alvarez down the left wing
[7266.18 - 7271.06] P:1792.62 E:0.095602 |  trench defenders getting back alvarez into the box now and then flicks it back to the edge of the
[7271.06 - 7276.42] P:1772.89 E:0.105703 |  area to messy and messy with camovinga is able to hook it across to paul with the head earth and
[7276.42 - 7283.30] P:1790.37 E:0.109943 |  that's not it away on the edge of the pot and that's it that is it the 90 minutes plus are up
[7284.02 - 7292.02] P:1811.17 E:0.099415 |  and we will have extra time here at the end of this world cup final in catta after a two two draw
[7293.30 - 7302.10] P:1735.13 E:0.083089 |  argentina two france two a match that france had to transform and did chris sultan
[7302.34 - 7309.38] P:1758.94 E:0.098181 |  amazing amazing second half france just were not in it and then all of a sudden muhane
[7310.02 - 7317.86] P:1772.99 E:0.080140 |  breaks beyond otamendi they win the penalty and bapé has the balls pops it in and then
[7317.86 - 7326.26] P:1850.82 E:0.087962 |  moments later gets a wonderful wonderful second goal nobody saw that coming two two extra time
[7326.34 - 7333.22] P:1708.82 E:0.089900 |  you're sort of fancy france an extra time don't you i have no idea what to make of this next half
[7333.22 - 7339.70] P:1804.24 E:0.095274 |  an hour because that made no sense whatsoever and then from there well that's why we've got you here rob
[7342.10 - 7347.78] P:1841.49 E:0.113283 |  oh look look who's look who's suddenly arrived very quickly at the end of full time hello jules
[7348.58 - 7352.34] P:1874.11 E:0.102962 |  you arrived a much quicker at full time than at half time didn't you
[7353.30 - 7359.06] P:1898.87 E:0.104383 |  i found the way much easier this time and and i met myself at kelly dis where was killing
[7359.06 - 7365.62] P:1899.96 E:0.093725 |  em bapé for 80 minutes unbelievable i don't know no shots at all until the 70th minute
[7366.18 - 7371.38] P:1927.54 E:0.098130 |  and then those two goals back to back the penalty first and then the second goal is a thing of
[7371.38 - 7377.46] P:1955.44 E:0.094376 |  beauty the whole big the one two with torami i lost my voice because because i shot it so much on
[7377.46 - 7383.14] P:1852.75 E:0.091205 |  a second goal but i just don't know when they find where they found the the resources to come and
[7383.14 - 7388.42] P:1747.46 E:0.101061 |  and go at them again the changes worked in a way i thought i thought command is doing really well
[7388.42 - 7395.46] P:1657.80 E:0.091773 |  to ram as well um and this came out of nowhere literally nowhere i mean i think it's fair to
[7395.46 - 7399.94] P:1546.20 E:0.098276 |  say the virus has run its course through this team but when you look at what france did after
[7399.94 - 7404.82] P:1558.27 E:0.092584 |  80 minutes you're right to point out the effect because it was commonly won the ball off off messy
[7404.82 - 7409.86] P:1766.56 E:0.093494 |  to start the move for the goal wasn't it but you can't put that down to any kind of tactical
[7409.86 - 7415.46] P:1723.88 E:0.090631 |  brilliance that was just a couple of minutes of absolute chaos and then the game was descended
[7415.46 - 7420.82] P:1697.67 E:0.090771 |  into an uncontrolled i wouldn't say mess because it's been brilliant to watch but it has been
[7420.82 - 7425.14] P:1796.37 E:0.099043 |  uncontrolled yeah that's right but if you if you remember the argentina game against australia
[7425.14 - 7429.62] P:1802.52 E:0.091637 |  they lost control a bit the last 20 minutes against the dutch they lost control as well
[7429.62 - 7434.74] P:1884.54 E:0.093783 |  maybe physically they're a bit tired because they were so good for the first hour and i think
[7434.98 - 7438.50] P:1892.62 E:0.104400 |  the the substitution from deshawn that's all he could do that's the only players really can bring
[7438.50 - 7442.50] P:1713.03 E:0.104256 |  on so are you saying france played for the chaos at the end of the game that they knew was going to
[7442.50 - 7447.38] P:1785.71 E:0.099700 |  come from argentina and actually this is all pre-planned genius exactly we just wait
[7449.62 - 7454.10] P:1685.88 E:0.106061 |  i'm i'm i can't take it anymore i don't know what's going to happen the next half an hour there
[7454.10 - 7458.58] P:1844.65 E:0.094639 |  it's going to be incredible well it'll be interesting won't it because they they left
[7458.58 - 7464.58] P:1948.58 E:0.087650 |  themselves open at the back as well and argentina had chances towards the end so if they
[7464.58 - 7470.26] P:1922.19 E:0.091607 |  continue extra time like they finished the last 10 minutes of normal time both sides
[7470.26 - 7474.26] P:1804.92 E:0.094545 |  we're going to have plenty more chances yeah you're right i mean let's not forget that eduardo
[7474.26 - 7479.70] P:1816.73 E:0.095288 |  camavinga is 19 this is the second game of his life i left back and he's the world cup final and
[7479.70 - 7485.46] P:1796.60 E:0.090237 |  he's gone messy in front of him and i mean i don't know what camavinga is going to do for the next
[7485.46 - 7490.42] P:1825.75 E:0.091814 |  half hour but this this is probably the most important half hour in his whole life to play
[7490.42 - 7494.82] P:1853.99 E:0.097770 |  completely out of position against the greatest player of all time but this is why he's down too
[7494.82 - 7500.74] P:1822.51 E:0.090102 |  now those 11 players on the pitch will have to to find a way of trying to win this gordon you
[7500.74 - 7507.94] P:1876.16 E:0.098968 |  don't retake your seat as messi and lorice do the coin toss for ends and kickoff for extra time
[7507.94 - 7514.74] P:1887.67 E:0.085474 |  chris myself and kelly would would when the referee didn't play advantage right at the end we said
[7515.38 - 7520.34] P:1900.93 E:0.093415 |  kelly said to me that's the first mistake he's made and he has he's had considering the pressure
[7520.34 - 7525.06] P:1745.57 E:0.102500 |  in our own analysis we are yeah let's not bring guests in no and we thought we analyzed not very
[7525.06 - 7530.98] P:1731.25 E:0.099663 |  well yeah who needs commentators and summarizers when we have you to uh that was though it was a
[7530.98 - 7535.46] P:1766.56 E:0.090300 |  it was a prep that's when france when this game has opened up that's when france look at their
[7535.46 - 7541.54] P:1823.68 E:0.090308 |  most dangerous you know they have that pace now and that power uh and and that guile up top but
[7541.54 - 7549.14] P:1842.60 E:0.082460 |  that was the first mistake what was that 87 88 minutes that's quite good isn't it so they
[7549.14 - 7552.42] P:1631.06 E:0.099318 |  toss the coin to the south go on i was going to say they've tossed the coin to decide which
[7552.42 - 7556.02] P:1676.58 E:0.093239 |  end they're going to play at the commentators have tossed the coin to decide who's going to
[7556.02 - 7560.58] P:1697.94 E:0.092482 |  start this period of extra time it is with chris sotman roggreen you just got a sneak peek of him
[7560.58 - 7565.70] P:1844.46 E:0.094202 |  there ian denis thank you kelly you know when john said earlier we were talking about what's jammy in
[7565.70 - 7571.70] P:1778.52 E:0.087742 |  french what's plummets in french because i honestly didn't think i'd be coming back on and when john
[7571.70 - 7577.94] P:1751.26 E:0.091442 |  said i'd have all his voice again well there you go because i don't think anybody anybody could see
[7577.94 - 7586.82] P:1778.69 E:0.089696 |  france coming back in to this world cup final and yet they have a bolt from the blues as we're

[8985.38 - 8991.22] P:1722.49 E:0.105321 |  and everyone from the bench everyone behind the goal was up
[8993.14 - 8998.02] P:1631.78 E:0.109506 |  and credit to argentina as well you know moment like that they had three men in blue and white

[9017.86 - 9024.18] P:1659.24 E:0.106338 |  just like it was when they last won the world cup in 1986 that finished three two to diegel

[9037.78 - 9044.26] P:1691.57 E:0.092584 |  he was off his foot not his chin he was offside in the build up but it was did go to him and that
[9044.26 - 9054.18] P:1681.57 E:0.095243 |  was just a bit of fortune they needed so messey now moves back alongside umbatte on seven goals
[9055.14 - 9062.98] P:1808.23 E:0.099604 |  at this world cup france aren't finished yet though and he has two ram on the left hand side
[9062.98 - 9067.46] P:1717.82 E:0.108233 |  nice footwork from him but it's smacked the way downfield by argentina verand with a header

[9090.82 - 9098.74] P:1827.71 E:0.101351 |  the ball bounces to akunye here akunye just gets to it before it rolls over the white line
[9099.46 - 9104.18] P:1748.95 E:0.107750 |  la tarah martinez is chasing this verand is watching the ball down into the full back position
[9104.18 - 9109.14] P:1810.49 E:0.110532 |  and he's stumbled as he passed the ball out of play i think he's suggesting that he got a shove
[9109.14 - 9114.58] P:1724.97 E:0.100745 |  but la tarah martinez didn't seem to be close enough to him no he's just absolutely shattered
[9115.30 - 9121.38] P:1649.04 E:0.102750 |  completely broken physically chasing that ball and remember verand was one of the players who
[9121.38 - 9127.22] P:1601.21 E:0.102857 |  affected by the illness this week and uh he's on his knees and i don't think he's going to be able
[9127.22 - 9132.90] P:1582.53 E:0.104021 |  to continue one of the john one of the argentinian substitutes picked the ball up and volleyed it

[9147.14 - 9156.34] P:1671.92 E:0.097464 |  was done double quick by uh by giggy a deshaun so ibrahim akunate of leberpool is is on the field
[9157.30 - 9163.62] P:1600.09 E:0.100038 |  in the world cup final where argentina lead france by three goals to two and now time is running out

[9208.02 - 9214.90] P:1486.35 E:0.093988 |  players on the field are involved in that but it's calmed down very quickly i think montiel knew what

[9326.42 - 9333.14] P:1731.19 E:0.111283 |  that's blocked in the area the referee seen a handball two argentine defenders threw them in the
[9333.14 - 9339.46] P:1738.25 E:0.099233 |  way threw themselves in the way of that shot from him bhabé the referee was instant he pointed to
[9339.46 - 9345.70] P:1808.55 E:0.112255 |  the spot and he's seen the outstretched arm it's the right decision it's montiel and it's a penalty
[9345.78 - 9352.02] P:1810.39 E:0.100902 |  and then bhabé will have a chance to become the second man to score a penalty to become the
[9352.02 - 9357.46] P:1815.71 E:0.091351 |  second man to score a hat trick in a world cup final chris Sutton i don't think we could have
[9357.46 - 9365.70] P:1727.91 E:0.093789 |  any more drama i thought that was it de mary in tears on the bench for argentina bhabé has to
[9365.70 - 9370.98] P:1614.01 E:0.099117 |  pop this one in i thought it was a penalty yep i thought the arm was out as montiel just turned
[9370.98 - 9377.78] P:1662.94 E:0.089095 |  his back slightly and bhabé hammered the shot trying to find that far top corner what a moment
[9380.02 - 9386.34] P:1881.97 E:0.110200 |  what a moment indeed now he is up against the arch penalty saver from aston villa
[9387.38 - 9393.22] P:1987.32 E:0.117095 |  ameliano martinez who very nearly got the earlier penalty that he scored in this match
[9393.22 - 9399.30] P:1990.95 E:0.113970 |  but this a moment of history in a world cup final only sujeb perce to score a hat trick
[9400.98 - 9408.90] P:1959.98 E:0.107323 |  on the greatest stage of all but now killion and bhabé in the golden boots from the penalty spot
[9408.90 - 9415.70] P:1893.88 E:0.114316 |  attempting to score his second spot and the final it's there he said martinez the wrong way
[9416.42 - 9425.38] P:1747.13 E:0.118837 |  and france have now made it three three and killion and bhabé joins sujeb perce as a world
[9425.86 - 9435.38] P:1687.20 E:0.109558 |  cup final hat trick scorer what amazing drama we have witnessed here in doha in this world cup
[9435.38 - 9447.46] P:1741.07 E:0.101468 |  final and it's not over yet and bhabé now eight goals at this tournament three three well and bhabé
[9447.54 - 9456.42] P:1766.73 E:0.100861 |  golden balls what courage what belief what confidence to slot that in martinez dived left
[9457.86 - 9463.86] P:1777.39 E:0.103247 |  but the pace the accuracy from and bhabé actually think he slipped his foot gives away slightly
[9464.98 - 9468.10] P:1872.01 E:0.114929 |  but finds the corner this is going to go all the way
[9469.94 - 9476.66] P:1729.60 E:0.101988 |  messy scores in extra time and bhabé scores in extra time and now argentina are breaking forward
[9477.22 - 9480.90] P:1698.36 E:0.100504 |  and the ball almost bounces for messy 25 yards out but it's cleared away
[9482.10 - 9491.54] P:1759.39 E:0.108115 |  argentina three france three what a storyline and now messy picks up the ball and sets off
[9491.54 - 9495.54] P:1776.50 E:0.104390 |  running at the french defense defenders throw themselves in on the edge of the d and are able
[9495.54 - 9503.14] P:1777.78 E:0.087060 |  to block it away comes back for argentina out to the left hand side those argentina fans trying
[9503.14 - 9508.10] P:1711.83 E:0.110814 |  to suck this in akunya with the cross comes off kunday and spins away behind wider than the
[9508.10 - 9513.94] P:1781.63 E:0.104464 |  opposing behind for an argentina corner rob gree well let's start the game he said it's not all
[9513.94 - 9523.22] P:1731.62 E:0.105741 |  about messing and bhabé i'll take it all back by in fairness dimaria did score one of the goals
[9525.46 - 9531.06] P:1712.69 E:0.101265 |  so messy to take the corner from the left hand side what chance they both score a hat trick in
[9531.06 - 9536.10] P:1712.89 E:0.097245 |  the final not from here it's a corner that is whipped into the edge of the d france are able
[9536.10 - 9540.82] P:1751.53 E:0.108427 |  to clear it bounces down for kunday and he clears it out on the far side well we're in the last
[9540.82 - 9546.50] P:1699.70 E:0.097260 |  minute now of extra time there's added time to come you would guess two or three minutes judging
[9546.50 - 9552.34] P:1669.93 E:0.096193 |  by the standards of this world cup but it looks like there will be that extra drama at the penalty
[9552.34 - 9560.42] P:1757.93 E:0.097435 |  shootout and you've got to give france so much credit for digging themselves out of
[9561.38 - 9567.70] P:1741.45 E:0.112008 |  hole after hole and here they come now with him bhabé on the left hand side and then bhabé right
[9567.70 - 9579.54] P:1721.85 E:0.106439 |  foot across and a stretching head and it's just wide oh my goodness oh what drama well this is
[9579.62 - 9584.10] P:1674.42 E:0.107357 |  this is sensational from him bhabé because as the ball goes out to the left hand side
[9584.66 - 9588.18] P:1734.74 E:0.104963 |  naturally i think we're all thinking he's going to run at the argentinian back line
[9588.82 - 9595.94] P:1635.19 E:0.096939 |  but he gets his head up and whips in a tantalising ball and muwani what eight yards out i don't
[9595.94 - 9603.38] P:1713.69 E:0.098669 |  think he gets any contact on the header but it goes agonisingly past the far post and martinez
[9603.38 - 9610.34] P:1586.63 E:0.097674 |  was a full stretch i don't think i don't think he got anything on it france making another change
[9610.34 - 9618.10] P:1667.38 E:0.093489 |  de sassy the monocle defender is coming on for kunde and argentina also going to make a change
[9618.10 - 9624.42] P:1613.51 E:0.091988 |  it's debala coming on palo de bala is barely been involved in this world cup came on as a late
[9624.42 - 9629.70] P:1655.36 E:0.091885 |  substitute in the semifinal has had an injury coming into this but clearly debala coming on with
[9629.70 - 9639.54] P:1705.83 E:0.097325 |  penalties in mind and he is taking the place of tallya fecal that took an eternity to go wide
[9639.54 - 9647.14] P:1656.52 E:0.102536 |  it just drifted and bounced and slowly no one knew no one knew whether that was going in or not
[9648.26 - 9654.34] P:1724.09 E:0.092662 |  what game we've had haven't we just the club has been too many better world cup finals than this
[9654.42 - 9660.66] P:1750.83 E:0.096301 |  i remember a time when they were very often a let down world cup finals but not this one
[9662.90 - 9670.42] P:1708.37 E:0.091080 |  so three three when it looks as though only the third world cup final to go to penalties
[9670.42 - 9675.30] P:1570.65 E:0.085550 |  will be the outcome here in doha what a finale it's been
[9678.02 - 9684.10] P:1673.90 E:0.104320 |  ball is with argentina three minutes of time have been added at the end of this second period of
[9684.10 - 9694.58] P:1769.83 E:0.095120 |  extra time so there are still 90 seconds to play time for one last twist perhaps which is what kune
[9694.58 - 9700.18] P:1664.90 E:0.103151 |  is doing now twisting and playing the ball forward and debala is able to get a touch on that lutarro
[9700.98 - 9706.58] P:1529.92 E:0.099283 |  martinez can't get there france clear canate to the halfway line finandez plays it through the middle
[9706.58 - 9711.62] P:1873.22 E:0.120091 |  nessie plays it over the top lutarro martinez is in might have been fouled still going defender
[9712.34 - 9719.38] P:1789.76 E:0.096416 |  it comes out and the offside flag is up against lutarro martinez yeah it was offside
[9719.38 - 9727.14] P:1837.59 E:0.089710 |  it was never onside at any point so it was a clear offside and just the way these games
[9727.14 - 9733.54] P:1691.60 E:0.094241 |  can't you just never know well 40 seconds to play a chris sutton 40 seconds 606 to kune with you
[9733.54 - 9738.82] P:1631.15 E:0.100428 |  and robby savage you'll have plenty to talk about after this yeah i'm not quite thinking about 606
[9738.82 - 9749.94] P:1717.99 E:0.099469 |  just at this moment job so penalty shootout seconds away france played over the top moine is in
[9749.94 - 9757.14] P:1844.39 E:0.112996 |  oh what a save by martinez stuck out a left leg came out get a star jump and moine's shot
[9757.14 - 9763.78] P:1829.94 E:0.112919 |  hit that left leg and now the final attack it's argentina and it's played forward into the area
[9763.78 - 9770.66] P:1732.29 E:0.113396 |  on the right flick the cross oh the header is wide from lutarro martinez from ten yards
[9771.78 - 9778.74] P:1751.59 E:0.107957 |  what a finish what a finish and the header well weighed he got it all wrong actually
[9778.74 - 9784.90] P:1680.89 E:0.102496 |  it was weighed by probably 10 yards he did but what a chance but the earlier one from
[9784.90 - 9791.78] P:1633.87 E:0.107474 |  moine the ball just helped up all over the back line of the argentinian defense and moine one on one
[9792.34 - 9797.94] P:1683.83 E:0.104408 |  just how crucial could that save be for martinez who only just went for power is thinking i'm
[9797.94 - 9805.62] P:1756.66 E:0.101327 |  going to put my foot through it and martinez spread himself brilliantly wrong huge huge save huge moment
[9806.90 - 9811.70] P:1792.05 E:0.106344 |  it was just he just made himself as big as he could was still playing i don't think the referee
[9811.70 - 9817.06] P:1789.25 E:0.110698 |  wants this to finish i don't think any of us do here's some babby who's set away by turemeni
[9817.14 - 9822.58] P:1724.25 E:0.108825 |  but down into the full back position babby taking on montiel one way and the other beats him again
[9822.58 - 9827.46] P:1777.37 E:0.119770 |  beats him again and babby's still going oh the cross comes to covering challenge between them
[9831.62 - 9833.70] P:1660.83 E:0.106669 |  if he'd scored that i would have walked out
[9835.86 - 9843.46] P:1812.33 E:0.107510 |  and that's it what a world cup final one of the best argentina three france three
[9844.02 - 9851.62] P:1768.30 E:0.103206 |  and everyone everyone on their feet inside this lucel stadium here in doha to give them
[9852.66 - 9860.58] P:1731.29 E:0.102622 |  a standing ovation what entertainment tristan yeah crazy crazy end to this game what has been a
[9860.58 - 9867.54] P:1636.74 E:0.096737 |  crazy game overall hasn't it somehow france dig deep again i've got to say i thought it was a penalty
[9867.54 - 9874.34] P:1392.58 E:0.097625 |  when it looked like messi had got the winning goal from a yard or two for argentina but that's
[9874.34 - 9881.46] P:1483.45 E:0.103722 |  saved from martinez i just wonder whether that could be the biggest moment in this game because
[9881.46 - 9889.38] P:1445.51 E:0.099069 |  moani should have scored but that's huge martinez at one end martinez at the other end and it's
[9889.38 - 9897.14] P:1508.47 E:0.093713 |  finished argentina three france three and baffe hatrig two from messi one from tim maria what a
[9897.14 - 9906.18] P:1499.05 E:0.086959 |  match pedal these become kelly and marg rob what a 120 minutes plus plenty of injury time as we've
[9906.18 - 9912.50] P:1541.92 E:0.092469 |  seen throughout this world cup it's been and as john said at the end of the 120 minutes everybody in
[9912.50 - 9918.42] P:1526.26 E:0.095209 |  the stadium on their feet bar a good percentage of the players who were on the pitch getting treatment
[9918.42 - 9923.62] P:1517.52 E:0.099696 |  for cramp it's taken everything out of everyone yeah me and chris were under the table as well
[9923.70 - 9930.82] P:1694.65 E:0.092255 |  absolutely exhausted it's just been a game of has had everything other than a red card i think and
[9930.82 - 9936.98] P:1679.56 E:0.084494 |  i won't write that off just yet but it's it's one way yeah france you have to give them so much
[9936.98 - 9943.06] P:1705.77 E:0.085797 |  credit for just picking themselves up off the floor continuously because you just could not give them
[9943.06 - 9949.62] P:1674.02 E:0.089695 |  a prayer after an hour they looked for lawn they just snapped your hands off now for penalties
[9949.62 - 9956.34] P:1564.68 E:0.084226 |  then for penalties now if you're going into a penalty shootout and you're the team that's
[9956.34 - 9959.86] P:1569.85 E:0.100220 |  come back from two nil down if you're the team that's come back from three two down
[9960.50 - 9964.42] P:1422.14 E:0.099883 |  which of them mentally do you think is in a better look you're both pulling faces that
[9964.42 - 9972.26] P:1618.10 E:0.096239 |  because if to say neither of them fine that's a valid answer yeah i'm with that one i i don't i really
[9972.26 - 9978.66] P:1727.44 E:0.098866 |  don't think it matters this is look it's a team game but this is so individual now these moments
[9978.66 - 9986.50] P:1669.38 E:0.097009 |  it's about uh belief and courage in your conviction now don't lose your nerve if you're a you're a
[9986.50 - 9992.58] P:1696.53 E:0.094402 |  player but it's easier said than done i mean this is as intense as it will get i've just i've just
[9992.58 - 9998.82] P:1779.52 E:0.095427 |  got a feeling for argentina with these penalties i normally get things wrong just because of that
[9998.82 - 10005.62] P:1736.17 E:0.090103 |  save at the end i thought that's such a significant save from martinez but who knows i just watching
[10006.58 - 10010.82] P:1751.10 E:0.097984 |  i was going to say but his head had chance as well rob two two minutes before he was
[10010.82 - 10017.78] P:1741.87 E:0.086520 |  cleaned through colin mearni his his head had chance as well it was two chances that if they
[10017.78 - 10023.38] P:1786.93 E:0.091035 |  fell to unbapate the game would have been gone it was done it was sealed the the the hour the second
[10023.38 - 10030.50] P:1757.94 E:0.088662 |  hour that unbapes had is it would have been finished it but they didn't but even still unbapate had
[10030.50 - 10036.26] P:1751.27 E:0.081384 |  the chance himself and didn't you so there's just so many twists and turns in this game can
[10036.26 - 10042.26] P:1785.88 E:0.101627 |  line up to something as well from me and rob when and when to take the penalty we both said martinez
[10042.26 - 10047.06] P:1746.29 E:0.098333 |  would save it we said and bapay would miss that how wrong were we well at bernie moe we've had a
[10047.06 - 10051.94] P:1782.27 E:0.093556 |  lot of discussions about the order of who takes penalties chris and i know you think it's utterly
[10051.94 - 10057.14] P:1756.01 E:0.093845 |  irrelevant messi went first in argentina's last shootout you would expect him to go first again
[10057.14 - 10062.34] P:1764.22 E:0.093922 |  and then imbapay to go first for the french and the penalties by the way are going to take place
[10062.34 - 10069.14] P:1699.93 E:0.093386 |  away to our left in front of the thousands and thousands of argentina fans behind that goal
[10069.14 - 10074.82] P:1692.43 E:0.092314 |  so the penalties are away to our left but messi and then imbapay or and bapay and then messi
[10074.82 - 10080.50] P:1725.80 E:0.094036 |  depending on who who's going first you're not bothered i i don't know i don't i don't think it
[10080.50 - 10086.74] P:1627.47 E:0.087714 |  matters the order at all okay i mean i would suggest that imbapay goes first wouldn't you kelly
[10086.74 - 10090.74] P:1671.87 E:0.105855 |  certainly if it was france i would suggest that it was going to be a bapay who would go first
[10091.86 - 10097.94] P:1830.28 E:0.106317 |  with you for the penalties and this is real playground stuff this is what kids do around
[10097.94 - 10103.70] P:1967.36 E:0.102718 |  the world they take penalties in the playground to win the world cup final for their country
[10103.70 - 10110.66] P:1973.48 E:0.099058 |  john marie and rob green but first of all ian denis and chris sutton thank you kelly thank you mark
[10110.66 - 10116.10] P:1928.74 E:0.100204 |  it'll be france to go first emi martinez remembers save the first two penalties
[10116.10 - 10123.06] P:1963.04 E:0.104101 |  against the dutch and it is and bapay who comes first you'd imagine that messi will follow suit
[10123.06 - 10129.94] P:1934.14 E:0.112096 |  he did against the nedelunds it's imbapay he scored a hat trick and he scored the first penalty
[10129.94 - 10135.62] P:1750.57 E:0.107837 |  right footed left hand side i think emi martinez got a hand on it well he's gone the same way
[10136.98 - 10142.66] P:1764.99 E:0.101079 |  every penalty he just backs himself it's a brilliant penalty i tell you what martinez
[10142.98 - 10150.18] P:1809.97 E:0.097712 |  yes flying to his right hand side left fingertips to the ball but enough power
[10151.86 - 10156.98] P:1762.67 E:0.101320 |  interesting choice that as well remember imbapay had the penalty saved against switzerland at the
[10156.98 - 10163.70] P:1788.05 E:0.097712 |  euros last year which was the decisive penalty this time imbapay took the first one and it is
[10163.70 - 10170.18] P:1776.17 E:0.098161 |  leon ol messi then messi who's already scored a penalty past loris in this match in normal
[10170.18 - 10179.06] P:1832.91 E:0.107464 |  time in the first half that was the opening goal so messi against loris tick two left foot oh loris
[10179.94 - 10185.86] P:1754.88 E:0.108225 |  went the wrong way but still had time to adjust but couldn't get there and it's in it's 1-1 in the
[10185.86 - 10194.10] P:1787.28 E:0.103001 |  shootout i don't think i've ever seen someone hit one so slowly and it's still going that is backing

[10858.10 - 10864.98] P:1766.22 E:0.092740 |  physically completely shattered from the game and they're all just so discombobulated as a team
[10864.98 - 10870.66] P:1736.04 E:0.097413 |  that they just had to do their own thing at their own moment and it manifested itself in this chaotic
[10870.66 - 10877.86] P:1715.61 E:0.100809 |  team which is brilliant but you think about the pressure from the start of the tournament on one
[10877.86 - 10884.34] P:1880.61 E:0.103643 |  player in particular but throughout that team who had to provide for him and how they must have
[10884.34 - 10890.66] P:1815.85 E:0.090256 |  felt throughout the tournament building up to it and then to finally get there and get that moment

[10925.22 - 10930.26] P:1697.92 E:0.101934 |  that gave that to well you can see it chris i mean that's a rubbish quiz and they're giving it to
[10930.34 - 10936.26] P:1742.66 E:0.097163 |  leonard messi i mean anyone of argentinian midfielders could really have claimed to take
[10936.26 - 10942.02] P:1756.65 E:0.095059 |  the player of the match but it's gone to messi but you look you look at the the bonds that have been
[10942.02 - 10947.38] P:1743.46 E:0.097350 |  created through through this team in these players and there will also chris there but there must be a
[10947.38 - 10953.70] P:1759.11 E:0.098313 |  sense of relief amongst them that they have managed to deliver it for the man who has won player of

[10959.54 - 10966.58] P:1780.78 E:0.096823 |  game i mean we can't lavish enough praise on on the manager as well you know when he took over
[10967.38 - 10975.06] P:1771.09 E:0.099373 |  it was a job nobody really wanted you know went out in the last 16 at the last world cup
[10975.06 - 10981.86] P:1816.32 E:0.098708 |  in russia and you know huge pressure taking over a job of such such magnitude but he's found a way
[10981.86 - 10986.98] P:1835.68 E:0.094370 |  and so of this argentinian team throughout this world cup you know it's been it's been little
[10986.98 - 10992.02] P:1817.23 E:0.100429 |  moments magical moments and then today you just wondered you know they get themselves in front
[10992.02 - 10995.70] P:1629.73 E:0.101591 |  they let it slip badly as they did against the netherlands they got over the line that
[10996.42 - 11001.86] P:1717.37 E:0.096219 |  night but then once and back they get to three all you're thinking you know maybe this could go
[11001.86 - 11009.38] P:1689.08 E:0.097531 |  against argentina but it's job done and i think most people around the world you know would feel that
[11010.18 - 11016.02] P:1707.75 E:0.099726 |  it is i mean rob rob's words were great you know it's this is a fitting end for leonard messi who has been

[11021.86 - 11026.90] P:1766.93 E:0.093298 |  it does seem fitting it does seem right that he leaves with winning the big one
[11028.82 - 11033.94] P:1759.34 E:0.100498 |  question that in bapain now does that count as scoring four in the final and still losing
[11034.42 - 11039.38] P:1681.76 E:0.102058 |  in a penalty shootout you don't get it you don't get the fourth with the penalty shootout but yeah

[11095.78 - 11101.46] P:1338.89 E:0.092398 |  villain someone has to fail but i thought it was an awful way to get what on the day was was the
[11101.46 - 11109.54] P:1367.34 E:0.088643 |  right results uh we wondered about the the team selection before and scoloni with his team selection
[11109.54 - 11115.30] P:1199.12 E:0.096573 |  what he said was my team is more important than the opposition i'm not going to go with the three
[11115.30 - 11121.22] P:1383.40 E:0.088677 |  centre backs and and and wait on the basis that their team is more important than mine i'm going
[11121.22 - 11126.18] P:1152.72 E:0.117315 |  to prove that our team is more important and it worked wonderfully well didn't it while demaria
[11126.18 - 11132.02] P:1276.14 E:0.094923 |  was on the field they played the three across the front it was very bold there with alvarez between
[11132.02 - 11137.70] P:1270.04 E:0.100975 |  messi and and demaria wide left they they gave france problems playing out they outnumbered
[11137.70 - 11143.78] P:1261.61 E:0.092707 |  france in midfield they amplified the space that the french midfield had to cover it was the first
[11143.78 - 11151.78] P:1306.11 E:0.103590 |  time that grisman as a midfielder became a problem argentina made grisman as a midfielder a problem
[11151.78 - 11156.10] P:1190.77 E:0.109991 |  and while demaria was on the field and has there ever been a world-class player with less ego than
[11156.10 - 11161.38] P:1304.06 E:0.108299 |  demaria whatever you need him to do he does he hasn't got a set role if you wanted to play
[11161.38 - 11165.06] P:1160.31 E:0.111842 |  wide right if you want him to play wide left if you want him to play him in the midfield three he'll
[11165.06 - 11172.10] P:1407.71 E:0.093630 |  do that fantastic performance from him but once he went off the game started to change and you wonder
[11172.10 - 11177.70] P:1357.39 E:0.094528 |  because every time the argentina defensive unit has been really priced under pressure it's almost
[11177.78 - 11182.26] P:1241.19 E:0.104115 |  as if the presence of the fans in the stadium becomes an inhibiting factor they're all having
[11182.26 - 11186.58] P:1310.77 E:0.106124 |  a collective nervous breakdown the fans are making the players nervous the players are making the
[11186.58 - 11191.78] P:1264.74 E:0.095717 |  fans nervous and as soon as france got one you thought they're going to get two here and anything
[11191.78 - 11197.22] P:1276.71 E:0.096494 |  could have happened in the the crazy last few minutes of normal time argentina i thought rallied
[11197.22 - 11201.78] P:1197.35 E:0.089599 |  really really well in extra time but it could have gone against them right at the last but i think
[11201.78 - 11207.70] P:1528.79 E:0.071751 |  in a horrible way we've had the right results they're still building the stage here in lucella
[11207.70 - 11213.14] P:1528.94 E:0.071828 |  it's taken them a long time to do that the argentina players don't mind they are celebrating with
[11213.14 - 11218.82] P:1580.44 E:0.069781 |  their fans whilst a few of them do interviews for television there's a great big drum on the pitch
[11218.82 - 11223.70] P:1472.52 E:0.070996 |  as well that one of the backroom staff is beating at the moment as they dance and sing in front of
[11223.70 - 11229.38] P:1517.33 E:0.075771 |  their fans gilya and lara has come up to join us as well i feel like i ought to give you a hug but
[11229.38 - 11235.54] P:1594.14 E:0.082019 |  then that might make it worse really i don't know for you and there will be a just a sense of
[11236.50 - 11241.62] P:1591.75 E:0.069708 |  what if for france really on on various different levels over the course of that game
[11242.26 - 11246.90] P:1545.69 E:0.074757 |  yeah you are i mean they show great character to come back not just once but the twice
[11248.02 - 11251.86] P:1621.89 E:0.088237 |  three two in extra time i thought all of us thought it was over and then kelly and still
[11251.86 - 11258.66] P:1582.04 E:0.075594 |  manages to find a way of scoring the other penalty and i mean i think it's cruel to lose like this of
[11258.66 - 11264.66] P:1562.25 E:0.080160 |  course and everybody in front would be hardworking the players crying on the bench right now with
[11264.66 - 11270.10] P:1536.84 E:0.084573 |  somebody again dizzy with kelly and embappé my own children crying as well at home which is normal
[11270.10 - 11275.94] P:1586.54 E:0.079807 |  i guess because you were so close and yet and yet just for a couple of penalties two really
[11275.94 - 11280.82] P:1543.11 E:0.076553 |  really good save one really good save and one miss and they will learn a lot from it and i don't
[11280.82 - 11284.50] P:1381.80 E:0.096362 |  know who will be there in germany or the euros who will be there in the next world cup in last
[11284.58 - 11291.06] P:1724.34 E:0.059068 |  world but this should also be like a big learning curve macron is actually or has been down on the
[11291.06 - 11297.14] P:1755.03 E:0.063155 |  field trying to go soul killing embappé as well i go back to euro 96 with england and honestly
[11297.70 - 11304.82] P:1704.03 E:0.058962 |  they show that gaza uh champs right to the end where he just misses his toe and it goes to penalties
[11304.82 - 11312.42] P:1709.48 E:0.060254 |  i sense in france you will see cola moani's header and actually his chance later on as well over
[11312.50 - 11317.78] P:1693.42 E:0.074276 |  and over and over again for the next years and cola moani will wake up i would imagine in his
[11317.78 - 11323.78] P:1726.71 E:0.066025 |  sleep seeing certainly the head well both of those chances yeah you're right for such a young player
[11323.78 - 11328.18] P:1532.02 E:0.078714 |  i mean you will have to deal with it of course and not that he would be blamed for it but it's a
[11328.18 - 11333.78] P:1618.07 E:0.075962 |  huge chance what at the end it's an amazing save i don't he could have done it differently but it's
[11333.78 - 11341.38] P:1615.54 E:0.075660 |  it's not it's i mean christ is looking at me with big eyes no i think with the header he was a little
[11341.38 - 11346.90] P:1696.41 E:0.082352 |  bit unlucky i don't know whether the ball was too far you know it was all a blur i'd love to see
[11346.90 - 11351.54] P:1836.35 E:0.070081 |  that again i think that the chance at the end he just rushed rushed this shot he could have actually
[11351.54 - 11357.14] P:1797.84 E:0.076431 |  composed himself and lifted it because martinez had just committed and was flying out of the only
[11357.14 - 11361.62] P:1680.16 E:0.090332 |  way he went low didn't he yeah he could have actually lifted it look it's easy to say no no
[11361.62 - 11367.86] P:1644.23 E:0.072262 |  sitting up here but that's one that he will not forget yeah no you're right and it's a situation
[11367.86 - 11373.38] P:1580.01 E:0.076183 |  where your best players are on the bench as well you know giro and grisman and it's the kids turam
[11373.38 - 11380.42] P:1455.30 E:0.060095 |  colomani the command is not so much of a kid but who for fanatron in midfield who carried you out of
[11380.42 - 11386.58] P:1599.09 E:0.088221 |  this incredible poor first hour and it's incredible the deserve credit is it's sad to lose that way
[11386.58 - 11390.98] P:1466.91 E:0.072477 |  it's very cruel but you have to give credit to messy in argentina as well because they were still
[11390.98 - 11395.06] P:1416.78 E:0.094153 |  fantastic and and probably the better side of all over the whole of the world in tournaments
[11395.78 - 11399.62] P:1563.24 E:0.101864 |  the huge cheer is because leonard messy has been out with a microphone
[11399.62 - 11404.74] P:1529.17 E:0.079735 |  in the middle of the pitch addressing the argentina supporters and the cheer was just
[11404.74 - 11408.82] P:1364.30 E:0.094320 |  because he spoke not because they could hear a word of what he was saying but he ended with a
[11408.82 - 11416.50] P:1299.63 E:0.088032 |  huge famos i don't know if it's coming through but they are chanting messy's name every single one
[11416.50 - 11422.18] P:1324.30 E:0.092075 |  of them chanting for leonard messy they're making the kind of we're not worthy arms as he as he kind
[11422.18 - 11427.94] P:1409.99 E:0.080257 |  of makes his way around the pitch and shows his appreciation for the supporters as well but it's
[11427.94 - 11434.02] P:1451.09 E:0.070001 |  hard to convey because we're trying to fight with this kind of canned music it's hard to convey just
[11434.02 - 11438.58] P:1445.95 E:0.070138 |  how much noise and how much emotion is coming out of those argentina fans but the fact that messy came
[11438.58 - 11444.26] P:1413.36 E:0.075383 |  out and spoke to them and presumably said his goodbyes this will be his final game he has said
[11444.26 - 11449.06] P:1357.55 E:0.066462 |  in an argentina shirt he's changed his name before but why not go out on the high of winning the
[11449.06 - 11453.86] P:1534.75 E:0.057812 |  world cup i mean i'm not sure they could hear him either really just the fact that he he had the
[11453.86 - 11459.30] P:1527.26 E:0.065381 |  microphone and was on the big screen was enough to send them cheering there are kids in that crowd
[11459.30 - 11463.14] P:1463.57 E:0.064250 |  with the fake at least i hope that's the fake world cup otherwise they managed to nick that from
[11463.14 - 11468.98] P:1537.37 E:0.064841 |  somewhere with the fake world cup at the front of the crowd the ultras the argentina ultras who
[11468.98 - 11474.50] P:1511.68 E:0.068958 |  have been there since two hours before kickoff and they don't they don't sit in their seats they don't
[11474.50 - 11480.18] P:1525.87 E:0.073054 |  even stand in front of their seats the front row and mike has joined us as well the front row
[11480.18 - 11488.02] P:1491.57 E:0.065166 |  actually stands on on the wall basically between the pitch and the seats and they have been there
[11488.66 - 11493.94] P:1484.83 E:0.080141 |  from two hours before the game all the way through the 90 minutes they might have sat down for 10
[11493.94 - 11498.10] P:1599.29 E:0.072602 |  minutes when it got a little bit scary towards the end of the second half just for a breather
[11498.10 - 11507.30] P:1577.95 E:0.067615 |  but the the scenes are like nothing we we have seen before no it's been absolutely fantastic
[11507.30 - 11511.62] P:1626.76 E:0.068642 |  i mean where you guys were sitting i was actually sitting to the right use and i there was about
[11511.62 - 11517.62] P:1594.15 E:0.066413 |  i don't know 100 argentina fans just in front of me and the noise and the support that they gave
[11517.62 - 11524.18] P:1610.58 E:0.058366 |  was amazing but these alters just behind the goal they've been fantastic i can only compare it to the
[11524.18 - 11531.38] P:1668.97 E:0.062391 |  morocco fans they were brilliant too but these have been here for for hours and they've really
[11531.38 - 11536.26] P:1703.23 E:0.058025 |  made the atmosphere in the game and this is what we that's what we come here to see i know it's
[11536.26 - 11543.62] P:1771.78 E:0.056018 |  probably been said loads of times already but that is the best game of football i have ever seen ever
[11544.58 - 11551.70] P:1748.37 E:0.068387 |  undoubtedly i was honestly out my emotions were like a wreck i was up i was down one minute i was
[11551.70 - 11556.34] P:1681.97 E:0.070664 |  a killing and bapu thunder that was a messy fun and it was just a great game of football wow
[11558.50 - 11564.66] P:1544.63 E:0.090063 |  it was a fantastic game of football but in the end there had to be a winner only one team are
[11564.66 - 11571.22] P:1530.56 E:0.089277 |  going to go and lift the world cup at the end of all of this and it went down to penalties it swung
[11571.22 - 11577.06] P:1669.18 E:0.091624 |  each way at the beginning argentina two nail up they looked like they were coasting on 80 minutes
[11577.06 - 11583.54] P:1671.74 E:0.074711 |  killing and bapu got a penalty to bring it back to 2-1 then a fantastic finish to make it to all
[11583.54 - 11588.82] P:1544.16 E:0.091310 |  it goes into extra time leon al messi of course with a goal that we'd looked at it by the bar to
[11588.82 - 11594.18] P:1552.66 E:0.089389 |  see whether or not it was offside he was given onside was that it but with 10 minutes to go of
[11594.18 - 11600.98] P:1665.79 E:0.073665 |  extra time killing bapu again brought fans level with a penalty and that took it to penalties
[11600.98 - 11608.34] P:1540.03 E:0.089700 |  the winning penalty for argentina was scored by guanzalo montiel this is how it sounded in argentina
[11630.98 - 11638.34] P:1352.52 E:0.086608 |  oh
[11639.70 - 11642.26] P:1733.26 E:0.071225 |  tamed it how fishermen's friends in argentina
[11645.78 - 11649.78] P:1281.47 E:0.108239 |  yeah and he's uh he's going to be gargling with pebbles for a fair while i think tomorrow that
[11649.78 - 11655.78] P:1591.09 E:0.084903 |  that one isn't it but isn't there some beautiful poetry in the fact that the fellow who takes the
[11655.78 - 11660.74] P:1355.51 E:0.091135 |  last the decisive kick is probably the least glamorous one on the field you know gonzalo
[11660.74 - 11667.78] P:1598.51 E:0.084945 |  montiel he's the reserve right back uh and it just highlights that this is a collective sport so i
[11667.78 - 11672.10] P:1475.74 E:0.097874 |  think there's there's lovely poetry in that it could have been messy no but messes out there
[11672.10 - 11679.22] P:1579.40 E:0.089009 |  taking the first one and it's the least glamorous player who puts it in and confirms the triumph
[11679.22 - 11685.22] P:1557.65 E:0.092825 |  for argentina which i think i think sends out a lovely message but it's it's never just about one
[11685.22 - 11691.46] P:1557.99 E:0.092240 |  player no the the basic rule of football is that the star shines when the team is right
[11692.26 - 11698.10] P:1583.20 E:0.082504 |  and the argentina after that desperately shocking opening day defeat to saudi arabia
[11698.10 - 11702.26] P:1501.17 E:0.090294 |  they've had to put things right they've had to tinker here they've had to tinker there
[11702.26 - 11709.46] P:1610.83 E:0.082179 |  and messi has had a supporting cast in his last world cup which is worthy of him and the last dance
[11709.46 - 11714.34] P:1627.76 E:0.061498 |  has been the best dance i'm so sorry that the story has to end but let it end this way
[11714.98 - 11719.14] P:1757.58 E:0.067613 |  the last time he was in the world cup final pablo zabaleta was one of his teammates
[11719.14 - 11723.78] P:1758.97 E:0.069918 |  he's been part of our coverage throughout the world cup on bbc radio and bbc television he's

[11797.86 - 11802.90] P:1099.54 E:0.084041 |  to appreciate it's not that long ago of course we retired from international football because of
[11802.90 - 11807.94] P:1129.01 E:0.086288 |  the defeat in the cop america the third one that they had in the final he was distraught he couldn't

[11846.90 - 11852.10] P:1485.73 E:0.069448 |  just try and give us some context to that starting with it being the first world cup that
[11852.10 - 11858.18] P:1477.72 E:0.078426 |  diego maradona wasn't around for the the the shadow if you like that they cast or the light that he
[11858.18 - 11863.46] P:1403.89 E:0.074071 |  shines on on this argentina team the fact that it is mesi's last tournament probably mesi's last
[11863.46 - 11868.74] P:1441.44 E:0.081246 |  ever game that there have been people like pablo zabaleta and teammates throughout the years who've
[11868.74 - 11874.74] P:1405.88 E:0.086942 |  tried to deliver this for leo mesi and that finally at the last possible moment they've been able to
[11874.74 - 11879.86] P:1359.04 E:0.078801 |  do it and we can hear them a chacha song which brings all of that into context that's it that's
[11879.86 - 11885.94] P:1234.44 E:0.087932 |  it yeah that that's stolen my line they're they're singing it for you no they're singing about all
[11885.94 - 11891.70] P:1182.43 E:0.092199 |  those finals that we lost and all those years that that that i cried but now now it now it's all
[11891.70 - 11896.66] P:1341.33 E:0.075256 |  over that's because they won the cop america last year and i don't think they'd won this world cup
[11896.66 - 11901.38] P:1511.55 E:0.072927 |  had they not won the cop america last year that took some of the responsibility off it made the
[11901.46 - 11908.26] P:1421.64 E:0.085470 |  atmosphere a little bit lighter because that was their first senior title since 1993 it's 28 years
[11908.26 - 11913.70] P:1242.01 E:0.085715 |  and when you have as many cop americas as south america does an argentina are one of the big two
[11913.70 - 11918.50] P:1432.71 E:0.083100 |  you expect to win titles much more and much more frequently than that but they felt jinxed i mean
[11918.50 - 11924.74] P:1460.18 E:0.088215 |  mesi when he retired briefly in 2016 from international football he said that it was because
[11924.74 - 11930.34] P:1582.70 E:0.080606 |  that he was he was feeling jinxed and that there's lots of players who are part of this process
[11930.42 - 11936.98] P:1390.71 E:0.076012 |  zabaleta is one and i remember i've told you this many times but seeing mesi for the first time

[11947.78 - 11952.98] P:1369.29 E:0.085725 |  he's he's he's been part of the process mesi's old mate sergio aguero he's on the pitch now
[11952.98 - 11958.18] P:1312.27 E:0.080097 |  he's been part of the process many of them they couldn't quite get over the line this generation
[11958.18 - 11962.98] P:1344.93 E:0.078304 |  have got over the line it's the best team in a collective sense that mesi's been part of in
[11962.98 - 11968.50] P:1307.27 E:0.090126 |  argentina he's joined the group the group of join him he's surrounded by his disciples if you like

[11977.14 - 11986.02] P:1544.68 E:0.068045 |  the process of the world cup trophy presentation there are various awards that get handed out
[11986.58 - 11993.22] P:1649.77 E:0.069224 |  obviously the french players have to take their pick up their runners-up medals as well it's going
[11993.22 - 11999.54] P:1647.46 E:0.062130 |  to be a fairly lengthy process is this it's actually been brutal jewels for the french players for
[11999.54 - 12005.70] P:1681.57 E:0.057356 |  the last five ten minutes and so they've come back out onto the field and because of the the way this
[12005.70 - 12012.26] P:1629.83 E:0.071383 |  is being staged they've been put very very close to the celebrating argentina players
[12013.22 - 12017.78] P:1490.37 E:0.087496 |  yeah i think it's probably even worse than actually losing the game because now they're all standing there
[12018.90 - 12024.50] P:1444.13 E:0.078622 |  they clearly in front of them like i don't know 10 yards out the argentine players celebrating with
[12024.50 - 12030.10] P:1592.77 E:0.064962 |  their families you see the children running around the wives the parents all the photographers are
[12030.10 - 12035.14] P:1515.38 E:0.066248 |  not far and then they have to stand there clearly miserable of course just waiting for their turn
[12035.14 - 12040.50] P:1462.70 E:0.064973 |  to go and get a medal that they don't want and and and still thinking about the chances that they missed
[12040.58 - 12046.42] P:1559.90 E:0.065980 |  the penalties that they missed it's cruel we said it is brutal that they can only be one winner
[12046.42 - 12051.22] P:1395.42 E:0.067368 |  and when you lose that way and i was there in 06 as well when they lost on penalties in a very very
[12051.22 - 12056.66] P:1462.68 E:0.064889 |  different game of course no rollercoaster of emotion but the zidane red cards and that that hurt
[12057.70 - 12064.10] P:1603.09 E:0.066618 |  jules you said last night in a way you could win both ways because either you get to see fans win
[12064.10 - 12068.58] P:1434.87 E:0.071591 |  the world cup or you're there for leon on messy winning the world cup in his last ever game
[12069.22 - 12075.54] P:1437.44 E:0.065269 |  that's how you felt last night it might even be how you felt on 79 minutes but once france got back
[12075.54 - 12080.66] P:1554.68 E:0.056567 |  into that game once there was a taste of it is that when it changed it changed completely
[12080.66 - 12085.94] P:1698.09 E:0.086028 |  Kelly you're right you're so i mean this is history that we're witnessing we're very lucky all of us
[12085.94 - 12090.58] P:1467.22 E:0.062819 |  here from five live and all the people the 80 000 people in the stadium to see this happening and to
[12090.58 - 12096.34] P:1612.13 E:0.068266 |  see messy lifting this trophy of course this is this is something very very special very emotional
[12096.34 - 12101.46] P:1485.77 E:0.074659 |  but i'm i'm good i won't lie and at two in a we said at halftime there will be no party for the
[12101.46 - 12106.98] P:1482.07 E:0.076230 |  french and then we believed again and this team is wonderful and what we said last night is that
[12106.98 - 12112.50] P:1488.68 E:0.086645 |  they went all this way by cutting the emotions off of all their games and today of all games
[12113.62 - 12117.54] P:1508.56 E:0.090506 |  the rollercoaster of emotions that they went through was just a bit too much and they just
[12117.54 - 12121.94] P:1464.18 E:0.073655 |  couldn't do that because argentina were great because it's a final it's the world cup and in
[12121.94 - 12126.34] P:1533.83 E:0.079422 |  the end i think the penalties were too much and i could have told you before that martinez who
[12126.90 - 12131.94] P:1540.85 E:0.084212 |  is the master of man games of trash talking we saw it even the referee didn't really know what to
[12131.94 - 12138.10] P:1422.56 E:0.078002 |  do with him but this is part of the game and i knew there will be only one winner and anyway as
[12138.10 - 12142.10] P:1501.78 E:0.075466 |  i think rob all chris was saying is is fitting that it's a little messy for everything that's
[12142.10 - 12146.82] P:1552.53 E:0.074679 |  done for this game is it part of the game rob green what martinez was doing at the end
[12147.38 - 12153.46] P:1540.85 E:0.058317 |  he pushed it to the limit didn't he he got booked and he should have been booked before that so he
[12153.46 - 12157.62] P:1624.59 E:0.076424 |  was going to go until he got booked and i think if the referee was on it a bit more could have
[12157.62 - 12163.78] P:1846.66 E:0.067043 |  done it earlier but that's the game and that's part of it and chris pointed out just give them
[12163.78 - 12168.10] P:1783.91 E:0.082515 |  time to think and that they will make a mistake and that's all you have as a goalkeeper because if
[12168.10 - 12172.10] P:1711.35 E:0.100058 |  they hit a penalty well you're not going to save it so you need them to make an error
[12172.66 - 12178.18] P:1799.18 E:0.080098 |  your your guess is as good as mine what's going on down here at the moment because
[12178.74 - 12186.82] P:1787.95 E:0.077026 |  the playing surface is plunged into darkness bar the stage big white stage the medals have
[12186.82 - 12192.66] P:1749.13 E:0.083465 |  just been carried on the sort of mixed reaction you may have heard was gianni in fantino leading out
[12193.62 - 12199.86] P:1732.43 E:0.071304 |  the presentation party i'm sure in the middle of that are some of the ruling members of the
[12199.86 - 12208.42] P:1569.97 E:0.055802 |  catari family as well president macron is involved in that party too um john murray maybe we should
[12208.42 - 12212.66] P:1681.02 E:0.057113 |  or ian denis one of you maybe we should have had this discussion before we came on air how are we
[12212.66 - 12218.42] P:1744.45 E:0.053093 |  doing this john will do the ceremony but just to quickly say this has been a record world cup
[12219.30 - 12225.78] P:1681.17 E:0.073988 |  the six goals here today we've now witnessed more goals than any other world cup 172 here in catar
[12226.42 - 12232.42] P:1583.45 E:0.074373 |  it was previously brazil 2014 in france 98 where they'd witnessed the joint record of 171
[12232.42 - 12237.38] P:1509.49 E:0.076648 |  so we've had the biggest attendance for a final since 94 and a record number of goals
[12237.38 - 12243.78] P:1528.12 E:0.075632 |  out here in catar in the last 29 days which micah is quite surprising because towards the
[12243.78 - 12248.34] P:1567.81 E:0.090413 |  end of the group stages we thought we were close to getting a record number of nil nil draws in this
[12248.34 - 12255.22] P:1592.11 E:0.057230 |  tournament that's just the games we were working on yeah maybe it was yeah i don't know you were
[12255.22 - 12263.62] P:1623.88 E:0.085450 |  watching i had a lovely time go mark and micah go do the tv one that gary doesn't want to do that was
[12263.62 - 12270.98] P:1785.41 E:0.087787 |  it was my favorite close another nil nil but look at this deno said it has now been a record
[12270.98 - 12276.50] P:1883.30 E:0.089824 |  goal scoring world cup it has been a world cup in which being on messy is is going to very shortly
[12276.58 - 12282.82] P:1786.67 E:0.072689 |  be able to lift the trophy killing and bap a getting to the the final we've seen stars like neymar
[12282.82 - 12287.86] P:1509.86 E:0.076743 |  we've seen someone like christiana ronaldo almost certainly bring his international career to an
[12287.86 - 12292.82] P:1508.10 E:0.068759 |  end we saw it with robert levin dotsky almost certainly bringing his international career to an
[12292.82 - 12299.14] P:1565.17 E:0.066495 |  end there have been huge moments in this deno in this world cup and it's been significant in in many
[12299.14 - 12306.02] P:1552.74 E:0.065931 |  ways and for individuals as well as teams very much so obviously the first african side to
[12306.02 - 12311.14] P:1740.77 E:0.072912 |  reach the last four huge from oracle first time ever in a world cup that all five nations from
[12311.14 - 12316.82] P:1732.41 E:0.062663 |  africa have won at least one game i think the first time since 2002 that you've had three
[12317.46 - 12322.74] P:1793.11 E:0.067979 |  different sides from different kind of confederations reaching the semi finals and obviously moving
[12322.74 - 12328.98] P:1759.46 E:0.073011 |  forward the format is going to change when we go to mexico canada and the united states in four years
[12328.98 - 12335.38] P:1736.28 E:0.063945 |  time but for for argentina to get their first trophy since 36 years and i just think as well of
[12335.38 - 12341.30] P:1673.26 E:0.051307 |  the final just a great final wasn't it just just pure entertainment drama it had everything
[12341.30 - 12347.70] P:1570.91 E:0.069157 |  and uh it's going to live live long in the memory it is difficult to think of a better final john moray
[12347.70 - 12355.94] P:1709.76 E:0.070094 |  isn't it it is i think you know there have been some gold packed finals over the years some one
[12355.94 - 12360.82] P:1857.09 E:0.070906 |  sided finals and as i mentioned during the commentary actually there was this period we went through
[12360.82 - 12366.74] P:1796.49 E:0.065644 |  where there were some pretty turgid ones as well you know time after time but this will go down this
[12366.74 - 12373.06] P:1750.69 E:0.078929 |  will go down as an absolute classic you're probably looking back to 1970 you know in terms of great
[12373.06 - 12381.06] P:1522.86 E:0.090540 |  world cup finals you know that famous the brazilian win and carlos alberto's goal but uh this is right up
[12381.30 - 12390.74] P:1717.96 E:0.079873 |  there so how they went for creuatia 2 in 2018 six goals was the most since 1958 when brazil
[12390.74 - 12397.14] P:1750.95 E:0.073345 |  beat sweden 5 2 and we've just had another six goals here so what they do now here on the stage
[12397.14 - 12401.46] P:1549.62 E:0.073214 |  is they're going to present all the individual awards then we'll get the runners-up medals
[12402.18 - 12408.42] P:1502.37 E:0.078594 |  and then we will get argentina getting their medals and finally finally finally at the end of all of
[12408.42 - 12415.70] P:1467.21 E:0.076159 |  that leonel messi will lift the world cup trophy so the first award has just been handed out and
[12415.70 - 12421.22] P:1487.44 E:0.090070 |  that's the fifa young player award and that has gone to you can hear the argentina asking enzo
[12421.22 - 12430.50] P:1565.30 E:0.069454 |  enzo so that has gone to enzo finandez who let's not forget chris didn't actually start that first
[12430.50 - 12436.18] P:1599.32 E:0.067546 |  game did he again sadio rapid no that's that's right and then he came on in the second game against
[12436.18 - 12442.02] P:1606.35 E:0.078984 |  mexico and scored that wonderful goal from just inside the just the corner of the 18-yard box
[12442.02 - 12447.06] P:1593.10 E:0.088732 |  fired it into the far top corner and then he's been an ever-present ever since they the next game
[12447.06 - 12452.26] P:1647.39 E:0.088089 |  against coland and he's been he's been really important scoloni thinking on his feet you know
[12452.26 - 12457.86] P:1562.32 E:0.089378 |  didn't start the competition but he's been a really big player for that uh for the argentinian team
[12457.86 - 12463.54] P:1616.78 E:0.071169 |  playing in that pivot roll um screening the back line uh the argentinian back line who have been
[12463.62 - 12470.82] P:1540.79 E:0.060285 |  to purple tournament uh and uh i i get why has won that award it's hard to think of of other
[12470.82 - 12476.02] P:1527.91 E:0.047910 |  candidates right now it's been that sort of afternoon and evening but i mean he has been top draw hasn't
[12476.02 - 12482.98] P:1435.26 E:0.067257 |  he the golden glove award rob green goes to emi martinez and it could have been given to him just
[12482.98 - 12487.38] P:1453.04 E:0.070041 |  for his penalty shootout exploits but it's not it's about keeping the most glee sheets
[12487.38 - 12492.74] P:1523.37 E:0.064908 |  continuing the fewest goals across this tournament yeah and it's been interesting hasn't it chris pointed
[12492.74 - 12498.26] P:1643.03 E:0.069878 |  it out we we had a look at the amount of saves he's actually made and it's not many they have been
[12498.26 - 12504.66] P:1681.69 E:0.060888 |  crucial saves one at the end of this this game one against australia as well when it was tight when
[12504.66 - 12511.38] P:1569.27 E:0.061231 |  it's two one in injury time and then the penalty saves as well so you look at it we're all going
[12511.38 - 12517.06] P:1672.86 E:0.057640 |  to talk about the great man messi and the team that's been built around it but he's played a
[12517.06 - 12525.22] P:1812.23 E:0.083339 |  huge part of the success and this is hard next the golden boot award goes to kylian and bapé who
[12525.22 - 12532.26] P:1779.07 E:0.092978 |  has to go up on his own with all the disappointment and losing the world cup final despite scoring
[12532.26 - 12540.82] P:1749.26 E:0.068425 |  a hat trick he has to talk to all the dignitaries president macron gives him the golden boot
[12540.82 - 12544.98] P:1674.80 E:0.068836 |  there are a few whistles and then they turn to cheers because as we keep saying this is a
[12544.98 - 12551.46] P:1584.23 E:0.055099 |  mostly argentina crowd jewels yeah i mean he won't be happy with that because that's not really
[12551.46 - 12556.34] P:1508.13 E:0.055980 |  the trophy that's the trophy he wanted but not not the only one and i think you could see with
[12556.34 - 12560.66] P:1566.70 E:0.080987 |  his body language still three goals in a world cup final the only player to do that research of
[12560.66 - 12566.02] P:1679.25 E:0.077543 |  first of course in 66 he's got four goals in world cup finals more than anybody else now
[12566.02 - 12572.42] P:1748.45 E:0.085705 |  more than tolay more than jago more than leo more than all the greatest of all time so for him
[12572.42 - 12577.30] P:1599.54 E:0.085072 |  he's been a very good world cup that he will obviously be disappointed i love the fight that
[12577.30 - 12581.22] P:1538.79 E:0.070213 |  he took the first penalty because remember at the euro's 18 months ago against switzerland he

[13443.78 - 13449.38] P:1397.88 E:0.092887 |  he's not a catalan anymore and i think even this is calculated you know even the vocabulary that he
[13449.38 - 13456.98] P:1444.43 E:0.096991 |  uses uh i think he really is he sat down and thought what do i have to do how can i become more
[13456.98 - 13465.54] P:1477.62 E:0.076735 |  argentine and he's uh in that quiet self-contained methodical way he's gone about everything he
[13465.54 - 13470.58] P:1438.41 E:0.085318 |  needed to do surrounded by it as i say this group of disciples and i actually think it's
[13470.58 - 13475.38] P:1470.93 E:0.098677 |  beautiful poetry that the least glamorous player in the squad the reserve right back montiel
[13475.38 - 13482.90] P:1538.55 E:0.088481 |  is the one whose kick will always be remembered as clinching the 2022 world cup and in the in the
[13482.90 - 13490.42] P:1661.98 E:0.077913 |  middle of there at the moment is Sergio Aguero who who has put on a number 19 i think he had a 19 shirt
[13490.42 - 13496.50] P:1682.30 E:0.066377 |  on did he did he take a spare off the mendy shirt i don't know but he he had a 19 shirt on and he's
[13496.50 - 13503.06] P:1707.63 E:0.060250 |  raised it as well because you know this is a squad this is a backroom staff team that very much
[13503.06 - 13509.54] P:1647.42 E:0.066140 |  relies on former players former internationals there are several of them there and pablo's
[13509.54 - 13516.10] P:1652.05 E:0.064348 |  abaleta was telling us pre-match how much this has helped this current squad no doubt about it but
[13516.10 - 13521.22] P:1477.75 E:0.092368 |  the aguero thing is interesting because when scoloni took over four years ago he didn't want to pick
[13521.30 - 13527.46] P:1579.78 E:0.084559 |  aguero and aguero was flying at the time with man city that was because there was a feeling
[13527.46 - 13532.98] P:1471.87 E:0.091829 |  that messi only ever talked to his old mate aguero so it was a way of trying to force him
[13532.98 - 13538.82] P:1463.62 E:0.093046 |  to be more outgoing and talk to other people so that there was that problem that was identified
[13539.62 - 13544.10] P:1578.39 E:0.090139 |  if messi doesn't imagine if you're a young player called up to the argentine national squad
[13544.10 - 13548.02] P:1566.82 E:0.086062 |  all you want to do in training is win his respect and if he doesn't talk to you if you don't know
[13548.02 - 13552.98] P:1549.58 E:0.079106 |  where you stand with him you maybe doesn't rate me that was having an inhibiting effect on the
[13552.98 - 13560.42] P:1561.06 E:0.078513 |  younger players so messi has changed his behavior and aguero there is representing not only himself
[13560.42 - 13565.14] P:1468.20 E:0.082025 |  but aguero is representing all of those players like pablo's abaleta who have been part of the
[13565.14 - 13569.62] P:1493.81 E:0.075460 |  messi years and who couldn't quite get their hands on the silverware i think that's something that's
[13569.62 - 13575.38] P:1691.38 E:0.074068 |  useful to see tim a word on the future for argentina because there were times during this tournament
[13575.38 - 13580.42] P:1395.45 E:0.091916 |  that we've seen what that might look like without leon on messi both in terms of the way that they
[13580.42 - 13586.34] P:1499.87 E:0.070365 |  will play going forward and in terms of the people that might take on that mantle yeah that link up
[13586.34 - 13591.62] P:1457.56 E:0.078681 |  between enzo bananas and hulin hulin alvarez former club mates at river plate that that looks very
[13591.62 - 13598.02] P:1528.07 E:0.090083 |  very important indeed uh and there are some good players coming through perhaps defense is a little
[13598.02 - 13603.22] P:1467.46 E:0.086527 |  bit of a worry and it won't be the same it can't be the same it wasn't the same without dig on
[13603.22 - 13607.06] P:1630.78 E:0.107056 |  maradona they were always trying to get him to come back even when he really shouldn't have come
[13607.06 - 13611.94] P:1508.23 E:0.098931 |  back and he got himself in in problems in the world cup 94 because of that they were always
[13611.94 - 13618.10] P:1666.44 E:0.094178 |  looking for the saviour well now once messi has gone he's gone you've got to look beyond him it's
[13618.10 - 13623.06] P:1638.92 E:0.092188 |  not going to be the same it's not going to be what we enjoy today but there there there are there's
[13623.06 - 13629.06] P:1602.88 E:0.095359 |  no reason to to despair and this group i think will have gained considerable self-esteem from the
[13629.06 - 13634.50] P:1543.74 E:0.083554 |  fact that they had to dig so deep and a number of times during the championship to get themselves
[13634.50 - 13639.94] P:1469.53 E:0.100870 |  over the line so it's it's it's not going to be anything like as beautiful as as global as it is
[13639.94 - 13645.38] P:1468.46 E:0.093702 |  with with messi because even here in brazil i think more people were supporting argentina than
[13645.38 - 13650.50] P:1638.47 E:0.081130 |  supporting france and that's extraordinary and a lot of that is down to messi it's not going to be
[13650.50 - 13656.74] P:1603.38 E:0.080908 |  like this again but it's not going to be a disaster tim vickery for the final time for this world cup
[13656.74 - 13662.82] P:1683.03 E:0.087264 |  thank you so much for joining us it's been an absolute pleasure as leon on messy brings his
[13662.82 - 13669.06] P:1678.98 E:0.086251 |  children on to the pitch here at the sales stadium to celebrate becoming a world champion and in
[13669.06 - 13674.02] P:1649.61 E:0.085056 |  fact talked earlier about Sergio Aguero's shirt whether it had otamendi's number 19 or not doesn't
[13674.02 - 13680.58] P:1708.44 E:0.091516 |  matter anymore they are now all wearing argentina shirts with campiones del mundo on the back of
[13680.66 - 13687.54] P:1714.52 E:0.083768 |  it they are the world champions we have about five minutes left jules is still here johnny and
[13687.54 - 13697.14] P:1671.17 E:0.060888 |  rob christ just a final a final thought from you jules on this whole experience yeah i mean it's been
[13697.14 - 13702.02] P:1642.60 E:0.075632 |  great once again to be with that french team to be with them every day to follow them you feel
[13702.02 - 13706.74] P:1639.80 E:0.082518 |  part of the adventure of course and and then that's why he hurts so much as well because it's hard to
[13706.74 - 13713.46] P:1672.92 E:0.069684 |  detach yourself from being part of it in a way but they've done the country proud a country that was
[13713.46 - 13719.62] P:1731.63 E:0.078774 |  full of skepticism when we start when we flew over here a squad that lost so many talented players
[13720.34 - 13725.62] P:1698.24 E:0.079776 |  so many of them missing so many starters as well and yet to reach this height and go that far was
[13725.62 - 13730.10] P:1656.59 E:0.084339 |  amazing to show the heart and the character that it shows for kelly ann and batte to score three goals
[13730.10 - 13734.66] P:1507.40 E:0.069337 |  in this final but it was written in the stars somewhere that this was always going to be leo
[13734.66 - 13739.54] P:1590.06 E:0.062945 |  mrs walk up and and it happened thank you for everything you've done with us thank you so much

[13745.06 - 13750.34] P:1703.97 E:0.078123 |  as you learn along with us rob let and let me start with you what as far as the football is
[13750.34 - 13759.14] P:1751.48 E:0.053307 |  concerned what has stood out for you i think for me it's been uh a real lesson of keeping the group
[13759.14 - 13764.10] P:1699.99 E:0.063485 |  of four in the group stages there's talk of it losing it for the next tournament going back to a
[13764.10 - 13770.26] P:1734.68 E:0.058823 |  three i don't think that works i think the every group stage had something on it by the end and
[13770.26 - 13776.26] P:1671.30 E:0.052572 |  that i think that was brilliant as a spectacle and then from there just the stories that have come
[13776.26 - 13782.58] P:1723.84 E:0.047963 |  from it for individual teams the history that's been made and the entertainment that's been there
[13782.58 - 13787.78] P:1732.28 E:0.051624 |  we've been had world cups that have had stodgy games defensive games and we've gone into these
[13787.78 - 13793.54] P:1698.51 E:0.055628 |  games going oh this could be keiji but it wasn't it was anything but so it's been a brilliant
[13793.54 - 13797.94] P:1604.31 E:0.067803 |  experience and it's been brilliant to work with everyone here and uh yeah what a great four weeks
[13799.14 - 13802.34] P:1278.34 E:0.092353 |  yeah been great to work with you too rob is that what you're is that what you were fishing for there
[13802.34 - 13806.98] P:1650.57 E:0.081622 |  yes there was a lot of silence obviously to do with you sorry big thanks yeah yep there was a lot of
[13806.98 - 13812.98] P:1543.83 E:0.074364 |  silence and also that must be sincere because you said it's sitting next to ian denis deno thoughts
[13812.98 - 13820.26] P:1728.60 E:0.064408 |  on the on the tournament well the football has been terrific cap by an incredibly dramatic
[13820.26 - 13825.14] P:1770.73 E:0.062929 |  wonderful remarkable final thrilling but i think the other thing is as well is that logistically
[13825.78 - 13830.02] P:1814.44 E:0.062460 |  i wondered how they're going to pull it off when you had eight stadiums in the space of
[13830.02 - 13838.50] P:1836.86 E:0.054219 |  like 46 miles and logistically they have pulled it off so uh the debate will go on about kata's legacy
[13839.30 - 13844.66] P:1918.52 E:0.055975 |  and and all the issues that surrounded it coming into the tournament but i do think that they have
[13844.66 - 13851.30] P:1839.38 E:0.058903 |  pulled it off very very well with 64 games in such a close proximity and we've had a record
[13851.30 - 13857.86] P:1810.84 E:0.053383 |  world cup with the amount of goals so um yeah that was what i would say it it's a world cup
[13857.86 - 13862.58] P:1692.19 E:0.060690 |  in a city and that's never happened before and there were as you say there were huge doubts
[13863.46 - 13870.90] P:1747.09 E:0.051311 |  about that and it may be something that they they look at again because it has changed the atmosphere
[13871.46 - 13877.94] P:1789.23 E:0.059225 |  of a world cup you know a winter world cup has caused a number of problems with the schedule
[13877.94 - 13882.82] P:1764.21 E:0.068613 |  and the calendar and what have you and it has been in Pep Guardiola's words and in set this is an
[13882.82 - 13888.66] P:1851.69 E:0.054122 |  insane season kata i think will now look towards the olympics but i think what they've shown with
[13888.66 - 13894.26] P:1858.32 E:0.056772 |  this world cup is that logistically they can certainly pull that off john moray the football
[13894.26 - 13900.26] P:1781.76 E:0.064461 |  has been great the best match was probably saved till last actually of memorable games this is
[13900.66 - 13906.26] P:1830.35 E:0.052293 |  probably being the most memorable um i still think we should always ask the question and we
[13906.26 - 13915.14] P:1727.05 E:0.059608 |  have asked this before when leaving south africa when leaving brazil when leaving russia what happens
[13915.14 - 13925.94] P:1781.19 E:0.050378 |  when the world cup party leaves and that is as relevant as and as important now as it has ever
[13925.94 - 13931.70] P:1755.91 E:0.048188 |  been well maybe what's happened here over the course of the last four weeks has actually
[13932.34 - 13938.26] P:1819.41 E:0.057616 |  changed the opinion and made people who live here think about things and how life is how the world
[13938.26 - 13945.46] P:1877.02 E:0.055433 |  works etc etc i think it's been it's been a fascinating month and i don't know about you all
[13945.46 - 13952.26] P:1829.40 E:0.056826 |  but i do feel conflicting emotions about what we've experienced over the course of of the last
[13952.74 - 13960.02] P:1706.79 E:0.049745 |  month some things here have been great you know a real really much better than than expected when
[13960.02 - 13966.66] P:1766.74 E:0.052611 |  we came here with some trepidation but you still have those reservations and and everything that
[13966.66 - 13971.86] P:1849.34 E:0.060968 |  was said in the build-up to this you know our our superb sports news team at the bbc and all of the
[13971.86 - 13976.74] P:1856.03 E:0.064246 |  other journalists who who worked and have asked questions about this world cup all of that still
[13976.74 - 13982.74] P:1823.59 E:0.056691 |  applies all of that applies and you know point people towards the there's a special bbc sports
[13982.74 - 13987.70] P:1776.69 E:0.056639 |  desk podcast at the moment which is all about how this world cup will be remembered what the legacy
[13987.70 - 13994.10] P:1759.65 E:0.054635 |  was will be and as ian says you know those questions remain and that debate must continue you know and
[13994.10 - 14001.86] P:1786.12 E:0.048963 |  the light has to continue to be to be shone here as well but um you know from a inner footballing
[14001.86 - 14010.74] P:1696.44 E:0.035870 |  sense there've been some brilliant memories brilliant experiences and um you know it's not
[14010.74 - 14017.22] P:1677.08 E:0.059001 |  been it's not been quite what we expected at all and and i think as you say mark it'll be very
[14017.22 - 14024.98] P:1788.46 E:0.034095 |  interesting i think as time goes by to see how we look back and think of this world cup
