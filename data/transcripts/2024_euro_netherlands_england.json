  "transcript": " And just before we get underway, Alan Shearer, just your thoughts, just before kick-off. Oh, that's not weird. I want England to show real intent right from the first off. I want to see energy, I want to see them try again and push high up the pitch and press out the pitch and show the Dutch that they're in for one LLB game tonight. And the World Service join us as England kick-off here in Dortmund in the second European Championship semi-final of the tournament. For the right to play Spain in Berlin on Sunday night. England fire it forward towards Harry Kane and the captain with the heaviest touch. Gatbal then collides with Walker and the much-talked-about German referee Felix Speyer. That's dominated the headlines this week. He gives an early free kick the way of the Dutch. Carroll's Southgate last night. I actually saw him greet the referee and the officials down in the tunnel area. It was all smiles, happiness, very, very friendly. I'm not sure that's going to be an issue tonight, Alan. It shouldn't be an issue. The players wouldn't want to get into entertaining that and certainly Gareth wouldn't want to either. It was always going to be all smiles if he did see him. Well, quite so. So the Dutch with the ball on the edge of the wrong pad at the area. These two very experienced central defenders Van Dijk and De Vrij. Both 32 years old. Van Dijk is just won the title again with Inter in Italy. Now he has done three on the right-hand side. Hits a long pass for Marl into chase. But he just dropped too early and the offside flag was up. I'm not sure he would have reached it anyway, but it's a free kick to England. Just looking at the system, it's pretty much what we expected. You can see when the Dutch had the ball there and Saka taking his right-wing back position up and helping his defenders out. So England's infosession in front of their own penalty area. England who have never reached a final on foreign soil. And here we are in a semi-final with England for the third time. In the four major tournaments that Gareth Southgate has been the manager for. Actually, if you had the Nations League back in 2019 when they lost to the Netherlands, it's four semi-finals. England with Walker, heavy touch. Walker though just touches it past Gakpo. Now Saka in field to Menu. Menu then, little ball to his left. Tud Balingam just dwelt on it. And as a result, he was closed down by Siemens. And now Declan Rice is able to muscle his way ahead of Marlon. And England have got possession back. And what is currently a dry evening here, it's nothing like as warm as it was last night. The thunderstorms have just eased the temperatures. But we have had some very heavy showers in the build-up to kick off. So, John Stones. John Stones just bringing the ball forward. Stones tonight, winning his 78th cap, which brings him level with two of the fine defenders, Stuart Pierce and John Terry. And now he's won ahead of the great Terry Butcher. Here is Rice on the halfway line. Declan Rice just takes it on a little further. Then there's a first touch over there on the far side from Tripp yet. Comes back in field towards the 19-year-old. Cobbie Menu is slipped by Fordham. As the challenge came in, he was nudged over in the free kick. After the challenge by Shelton, goes England's way. They've done really well, those two midfielders, for the Dutch Shelton and Reinders. And that's going to be a huge responsibility on those two tonight, particularly with the positions that Fordham and Bellingham will want to get into. You can see them now, they've just actually either understood on them. Yeah, they've been consistent selections. In advance of the tournament, you would have thought Frankie De Jong and Coop Miners, maybe Martin De Ronde would have been in there, so they've done very well, these two. Here's Fordham as England moving through the middle, but then the recovering De Pryde just takes it away from him. And Van Dijk goes back to Per Proggen, who Fordham goes all over. He had to be very sharp there. The 21-year-old, Dutch goalkeeper, all in yellow. And England playing it out to the white headband of De Pryde. Now you can hear the orange. Simon's ball through to Marlon on the edge of the penalty area, but a very good challenge from Walker, coming across, timed it well, and the ball was just deflected back to Pickham. That was really good play from the Dutch, the way they moved it back from the goalkeeper, through to the midfield and then into De Pryde, and then trying to get the ball forward quickly into Marlon. Want to watch that one. Early thoughts, Matt Upsum? Yeah, it just shows you back. I mean, England really went hard on the press there, didn't they? Foden went all the way into the keypun. And Holland played through really well. He is spelling him now. Striding from deep, plays it to his right, the Harry Kane. Now Saka, right side of the penalty area. Saka, up against Nathan Ackie, kills it in left foot, it's towards the back post. Red defy, got his head to it, didn't clear the penalty area. Trippie is there, he's able to get the ball down. Rice, this is the first real pressure that we've seen from either side. And England testing the Dutch defence. Rice, now Phil Fordham, still waiting for his first. Toss it with involvement in terms of goal or assist at the tournament that his pass forward found Trippie in an offside position and it's a free kick for the Dutch. It shouldn't be offside there, Trippie. He's looking right across the line. In his defence, he did want the ball played to him that little bit earlier because he'd gone and wanted it, but because it didn't and there's a little bit of delay on it, he then ran into an offside position. So Netherlands, Nail, England, Nail. The Dutch intercession on the edge of their own penalty area, the Dutch, who themselves have not been in a World Cup or European Championship semi-final for 10 years, not for 20 years in this competition since Euro 2004. Here's Van Dijk, who missed the last Euros. Remember when England went so close at Wendley? De Vrij, very, very patient. And then Schaapten back to Van Dijk. And here is Nathan Ackie. Nathan Ackie with his club mate, Phil Forden, closest to him. Now it's worked here to Reinders, Gackpaw, one of the joint top scorers, dis-possessed by Saka. And Saka making ground quickly up to Harry Kane, gives it back to Saka. Kane might have been felled, but the referee waves the advantage. Although Saka is actually just weaving from right to left, but England retained possession. Rice goes back to Stones and then Walker a little ball in for him to Bellingham. Maynou's just back to A to the right-hand side. You see Ronald Kuhmann for the first time down there since the start of the match with his still-blonde hair, dressed in black, England's all-adversary. As Trippier sends one forward for Bellingham to chase, but that will just bounce through to Verbrogan. It's a really good tackle from Saka, wasn't it, when the Dutch were trying to get the ball into Gackpaw? It was one of those where... I'm just going to let you know I'm here in the first few minutes of the game. He timed it to perfection, Saka, that tackle. Yes, he did. 0-0. And De Vrij. And Van Dijk again with the ball halfway inside their own half. Harry Kane comes to him. And so Van Dijk plays it to Dumfries over there on the right-hand side. The other inter-man, his pass for Mark Gay back in the team as well. The Rea just gets to it. Rice is robbed by Simon. Simon shoots and scores! What a super strike that was from Simon from the edge of the penalty area. It arrowed beyond the dive of Pikvijd. I said Pikvijd as well has just collided with one of the Dutch players. But it is 1-0 to the Netherlands and a goal in the seventh minute and the Dutch are ahead in the semifinal. Wow, what a strike. He couldn't have hit it any better. It just opened up for him and the shot was so inviting that he wasn't going to turn it down. What was it, 20-23 yards out? And it pinged into the right-hand side of the net. Pikvijd had no chance. Did really well in winning the tackle. Takes the ball off of Rice, I think it is, in there. Then it just opens up. There's no pressure on the ball. What a strike, what a goal. It's not often you see Declan Rice, dispossessed in that area of the pitch. Simon's really was aggressive. He wanted the ball and he took it. And then from then on, the positivity, he just saw the hole. It's a funny technique, the way he hits it. He's almost kind of sliding into the shot, strikes it really straight on, but hits it really flush. Sweet into the top corner, super shot. So there we are, a big early setback for England. And Fagaris Southgate as Savi Simons of PSG scores in front of the now-orange wall. He has Bellingham on the edge of the penalty area. So once again, England are going to have to come from behind. Bellingham's attempted cross, that's blocked. Came from behind in the round of 16, came from behind in the quarter-final. And here today, they are behind early in the seventh minute. Simons, what a goal it was. Brilliantly struck. Just his second-friest country and it flew past Pickford. There is a foul for Marlins' challenge on Bellingham who was caught about the face. And it's a free kick to England near the left corner of the penalty area. I think they just battled for the ball and you may have just took one on the face with Shouten, I think it was, wasn't it? The little clash of heads, isn't it? And Bellingham, actually, Kieran Trippier saying to them, the England medical people who ran onto the field, Kieran Trippier is actually standing over him and saying, go on, actually no, we don't need you. And they've just run off the field on the far side. Bellingham's OK, but actually now the Dutch medical people have been called on because Shouten, who did collide, he is going to be looked at. And it is a knock-up head, so understandable. But in England's set piece, what a goal that was to score in a semi-final. I see one striker was, he won many better than that in his career. It was really impressive the way he robbed the rice of the ball and then thought, you know what, I'm going to have a pop here. It just flew into the top corner. But England here have got a free kick in a really promising position. Last night, France went ahead early against the Spanish. And great goal that was here by Simon. So I don't think it was quite as good as Lameen Yamal's last night, which I think will have to be the goal of the tournament. Alan? Yeah, that was an incredible strike as well. From a 16-year-old, Johnny's 17, isn't he, on Saturday. So, yeah, what a goal. What a goal we've seen this evening. And actually, Bellingham has just gone off the field. They're just having a look at him, or has he just gone for... Actually, the referee's just gone over there to Jude Bellingham. The history they've got between them, just a little word between the two. I think he needs both of them to stay off the pitch because the trainers have both come on, so both players have to go off. They came on the field, so, yeah. So it's a free kick then, and both playing with 10 men and actually shouting, sitting down on the far side. Trippie, no, it's going to be Foden to take this free kick in, which is headed away by Ake, who did well, won that header commandingly. Seen him do that so often from Manchester City. Saka wins the ball back, the man who scored the equaliser. And the quarter-final, Saka is bungled into by Gatko, so sends him flying, and it's a free kick that the Dutch don't like, but shoulder into the back. He's had a good start to the game, Saka. You know, he's made a couple of really good tackles and trying to force his way down that right-hand side and trying to put the pressure back on them. He just switched on to us late. Alan Shearer is with us here on 5-Live tonight for the commentary, and the highlights will be on BBC One tonight after the news, and it's a free kick to England, England trailing to that early goal from Savvy, Simon's, and Trippie and Foden trying to work something again. England have created so little from set pieces without the Harry Maguire threat at this tournament. He's been a big miss in that regard. Free kick that Trippie at will come up and strike now, curling it in towards the back post. Rice is there, tries to work it across, and Kim was on the edge of the six-yard box, but Van Dijk got there to lash it out and play into the England fans over on the far side. You mentioned the lack of chances from set pieces. There's actually been a lack of chances in all of the games that they've played. It's been one of the big disappointments, with the forward talent that they've got. They just haven't created anywhere near enough. Yeah, it is perplexing, actually, as Rice gets the ball back with the referee spotting him in the fringe. They played it back to Trippie, who was then in an offside position, so it's a free kick to the Dutch. For the second time, Trippie, again, he's looking right across the line. And he is offside, he can't have any complaints. It is the Dutch who take the free kick, and Bellingham and Schouten are both back on the field. I think, yes, there is Schouten down there, the number 24. Great noise from the Dutch as England try to respond. Here is Manu, going between two Dutch players, gives it to Trippie. Bellingham's out there, Bellingham picks out Kane. On his right foot, Kane shoots and for Brogdon has to go down and save that, the shot from probably 25 yards plus, and it's out for a throw on the far side. Yeah, why not have a pop? Very much like it did for Siemens, it opened up for him. He didn't need a second invitation, it was a decent save. Keep it down to his right-hand side. So that's England do have an attempt on target, and for Brogdon had to make a decent save down to his right, had a good sight of it. England, as they play from left to right here as we look, behind already, Rice back to Gay. Now here's Trippie, over on the far side, comes back to Mark Gay, who will just steer it all the way back to Jordan Pickler. So let's bring in Matt Upsson, again, thoughts, Matt? He has an interest in Parry, wasn't it, from the Brogdon? He made it look easy, but he parried it all the way out for a throw. It's a really good piece of play from the goalkeeper, but Harry Kane just dropping into that pocket, England with good possession, he found some space and got a shot off. Bellingham passes intercepted, but into the path of Kane. Now the Saka, Saka, under his left foot, trying to find a position, still going, Saka shoots, it's blocked, then Kane! Over the top of the crossbar and Kane's been caught in there. As Kane hit that, he's clutching his right foot and he's in some pain as the shot flew over the top of the crossbar. Well, the England players are looking to the referee, they think there was a collision. Saka does really well, he runs into the traffic, but then the ball falls, kindly for Kane. I think it's just Dumfries that comes in with that challenge. He does connect with him, you know. As he came in, Dumfries, Kane had already hit the shot. And let's bring in Izzy, this is at your end Izzy, so you were 10-12 yards away from it. Yeah, if that, John, I mean, it's a wonderful strike from Harry Kane, he does so well to generate the power and I thought it was in. And it sailed over the bar, but there was some power behind it and he went down, Harry Kane, in a lot of pain. And he did catch him late, didn't he, Dumfries? I know that you guys can see the monitor up there, but Kane's shot earlier to that as well was fantastic, because he hit it into the ground and Vibrugan has had to really, really watch that, because that's how to score, is to hit into the ground and watch the ball fizz off the surface. The referee is saying to Vibrugan, do not take this goal kick because there is a check, there's a VAR check and I can understand why, Alan. Absolutely, he does get a good strike on it, but there's no doubt about it, Dumfries comes in for the challenge, doesn't get anywhere near the ball, but it's a... There's the square, the referee's being called over to have a look, and we know what this means, it's going to be a penalty to England. There was no contact at all with the ball from Dumfries, he actually collects with Harry, even more that he had to follow through, but there's no doubt that he boots up high and Harry does get the ball, but he also, with a full follow through, then connects with him. Pat, as the defender... I mean, is it hard to see whether he gets a touch of the ball, Dumfries? I don't think he gets a tone on the ball, therefore the follow through of Kane, he does raise his foot and he studs her up, Dumfries, which is why Harry Kane's in so much pain, he's actually struggling to shrug off the knock on the top of his foot. I mean, it's a fair challenge for the ball and he's a little bit late. It's a penalty. VAR, the German video assistant referee, in conjunction with Felix Weier, they decided it's a spot kick for England. And Kane, who took this knock on his right foot, and I think there was concern from Garas Southgate, he sent Pukaj Osaka over to see Harry Kane, to see if he was all right to take this penalty. What do you think the answer is, Alan? No, Harry's got to take the penalty, I think he's up there, he might be in some pain, but believe you me, when you get a penalty, that pain wears off. Yeah. So, Harry Kane, now... I think he's just booked Dumfries as well for that, John, which is... I mean, it's pretty harsh. I mean, he's genuinely gone to block the shot, I don't think he's lashed out at Harry Kane, I think he's got a little bit carried away there, the referee. The yellow card for Dumfries, and Virgil van Dijk was in long discussions with referee Zweiher. Memphis de Pijen was going in for there as well. But here we are, another penalty at Euro 2024, and this time, Harry Kane from 12 yards. In front of the England fans, it should be said, this is the North End, where the England fans all are. Kane, the man who scored more penalties for England than anyone else. But remember the miss in the quarterfinal in Qatar. Kane stands one foot in front of the other, and waits and waits. Final, big, deep breath, and Kane is up to score! Into the bottom corner! The broken went the right way down to his right, but Harry Kane can celebrate here in Dortmund. He's got his third goal of the tournament, and he's now the joint-leading scorer. And it's Netherlands won, England won, and down to you, is he, Christensen? Unbelievable penalty from Harry Kane. He looks so confident. He controlled every single person in this stadium. He took a big, big, deep breath, and he just slots it into this bottom corner, right in front of my eyes. I was watching Keir and Trippie throughout that whole process. Him and Jude Bellingham were just guarding Harry Kane, keeping him safe for many distractions. He looks so focused, clean from the penalty spot for Harry Kane. Really, really calm. And he hits it to perfection. He has to, because the goalkeeper goes the right way, to his right-hand side. Having said that, he's not stopping it. Went right in the corner, right in the side netting. I mean, it doesn't matter how well the goalkeeper dives at that one, because he hits it that hard and that low, it sneaks just inside the post at the bottom. Nearly impossible for any keeper to save. Top penalty from Harry Kane. Netherlands won, England won, and England equalising from the penalty spot through Harry Kane's 22nd penalty for England, out of the now 66 goals that he has scored for his country. England's record score-ups. The ball goes back to Thurbroggen, who went the right way, Alan, he wasn't too far away from it. I would have guessed he would have gone that way as well, very much like the goalkeeper, when you hit it as sweetly as that. It's where he wanted to put it, it's where he practices on the keeper, can go away every once, he's not stopping it. So back on level terms. The Dutch lead lasted for 11 minutes. And with that goal now, Alan, that is 15 for Harry Kane at either World Cup or European Championship Tournament. And he's drawn level at Euros with a certain Eishira. Seven goals. Let's hope we beat it tonight then. Is that a good start to this game, you know? He has. He had the shot from 20 or 25 yards, which he'd keep the save. He then had the shot which got the penalty, and then it caused the penalty. So that's the voice of the now joint leading scorer at the Euros for England, Alan Shearer. As De Pymis controls the ball out of play. Important door for England to make a quick response. Yeah, absolutely. I thought their response was really good, actually, because they were the initial threat from the Dutch. And England just settled themselves down. I think the Dutch will feel hard done by with that penalty. Because I agree with Matt when the defender goes in there. There was no intent to keep him in. He didn't really make the contact. It was the follow-through which Harry Kane generated with his shot. He has Foulden bringing it forward, gives it to Bellingham. Bellingham just turns, passes it to Trippier, just took a moment to get it under control. Foulden wants it, gets it. Now back to Declan Rice, who was just caught out for that opening goal. I think he slipped, actually, didn't he, when Simon's got the ball and took it away from a gay back in the side tonight for Konza, who's a little unfortunate, Esri Konza, because he put in such an impressive performance against Switzerland in the quarter-final. But he has Menu now in the pink boots, turns, faces the play, gives it to John Stones, takes it towards the halfway line and then Stones goes back across to Mark Gay. Brilliant atmosphere inside the ground. I mean, all of the stands, all of the spectators, close to the action as Menu chips it over the top cut. Phil Foulden, it bounces away. Trippier's going to leave that to Harry Kane, who's out there on the left-hand side. Kane now with the right foot crossed, it's a high-high one, right across the field, the Walker, who pulls that down, tried to lay it back to Menu on the edge of the box. They'd only succeeded in giving it to Reinders, who will pass it away to De Pauw. I think might have been given a shove in the back by Kyle Walker, but in any case, it's ever played for a throw into the Dutch. He did give a little shove, didn't he? I thought I didn't know whether Reff was going to give a free kick or at the throwing for the Dutch, but he's given a throwing. It's a proper match, isn't it? It's a really good start. It was a bright start from both teams, but then that fantastic strike from Siemens, it's a close to West to England. What are you going to offer? The Dutch tried to work it away through the middle, but Trippier comes across the right foot and pulls forward towards. Dalingham is in the centre-circle. Dalingham, this is former home as well, remember? Jude Dalingham, Foden, back to Kane, and he'll give it back towards the half-way line. Walker finds Foden, folding a little pass in field towards Manu. Kane wants it, but Manu up to the edge of the area. Slip it into Foden, Foden could be through, very tight. Oh, and the shot is blocked on the line. Incredibly by Dumfries. Brilliant footwork from Foden. How he found space in amongst all of that and got the shot in from the tightest of angles, and yet Dumfries right on the line stopped it. Well, we're not sure how it hasn't gone in, but all of us are looking to the referee to see whether the ball had crossed the line. Manu did really, really well in getting the ball to Foden, but then Foden's quick feet. He then goes to the goalkeeper and saw the slots it passed him. Saka, now left-footed ball. Trippier's got so much space on the left, Trippier's ball all the way across, a stretch and away by Defraie. The Dutch really stretch there. Now, they're trying again in England. There's two balls on the field. So the referee's have to stop play. How on earth did that happen? England, great momentum there. Two balls on the field. Well, we've seen 23 minutes of great football. I really encourage the way England have come back into this game, the way they're moving the ball around, the way Bellingham and Foden and Manu are controlling now that midfield and creating chances. Back down pitch side, is he? There's a beautiful weave from Foden, wasn't it? How many times have we seen him do that for Manchester City? He just takes on so many players. The way he got the shot off in the end, and it was a brilliant clearance from Dumfries on the line. Everyone behind me obviously thought it had gone over, but from my angle, to be honest, it definitely didn't cross the line. But it was unbelievable, unbelievable from Foden. It was immediately the referee's fire said, no, it hasn't crossed the line. We've not had a chance to see it again, but actually I need to see it again, because Foden's feet were almost quicker than the human eye. Rice with the pass to Walker on the right-hand side, now Foden, Manu back to Phil Foden, who, well, after that, goodness me, he certainly looks like he's in the mood to, like the rest of this England side, confound the critics, walk his ball into the edge of the area. It's 1-1 if you've just switched on. Siemens scoring the early goal, further touch, and Harry Kane with a penalty to equalise at the stadium, where he's now scored six goals in five competitive appearances. Harry Kane here is Saka, he's able to get the ball and run from 30 yards, goal-wards, Kane tries to turn, I thought he might have been caught there. Siemens is in there, and Siemens is able to play it back to Foghagen, who will clear up towards the halfway line, where Rice is underneath that, the headed, and it will bounce for Harry Kane, who pulls it down. Kane sets off on a run, and he's eased over by Dumfries. Has no free kick. I think Kane will be questioning that. Oh, but Foden almost in, but to Rice, he nipped the ball away from Dumfries, and Foden is saying that he was impeded there. I think he was, I think he definitely clipped the back of his heels. Foden really, really well and managed to nick the ball, but then when he's starting to run towards goal, he did, he just clipped his heels. So it's an impressive last 10 or 15 minutes from England, you know, the way, the move in the ball. However, here's one for Marlon to chase through the middle, that's headed away by Gay, now Rinders. Siemens gets that down, might have been a handball. Siemens' ball is blocked on the edge of the box by Rice, comes out to Rinders, who's very, very neat, shiny black boots. Sharp side parting. Again, Rinders back out to the right-hand side. Here is the cross that is blocked by Dumfries, and bounces out of play off Trippier for a throw over on the far side. Netherlands won, England won. I would say, Alan, that's the best period of play that we've seen from England. Absolutely, I said about moving the ball quicker, that's what we've been watching from Spain, where the vast majority of this tournament, for the last 10 or 15 minutes, England have done that. And to sink confirmation on our little screen here in the commentary box, that it was, the ball was about one-half way over the line, when it was stopped by Dumfries. Close, but not close enough, and here is Rinders, the number 14. Here's Gatpole, hardly been in the match. Gatpole, Gatpole back to Ney Den Ake, and now Gatpole, once again with his three goals. As I say, Harry Kane now joins that group. It's now six players who are all tied on three goals, as the joint top scorers at the tournament, with Harry Kane much more lined, being one of them. Can't be too bad if you're the joint top scorer at the tournament. He always will score goals, John, you know that. We all know that, that's why he's in the team. We know that we want a little bit more from him, so maybe off the ball, but the one thing he will guarantee is goals. Yeah, quite so. Here is De Vrij, who just carries it forward, and then Dumfries goes back to De Vrij again, through the middle, and attempt to click from the tie. It's blocked away, then Bellingham's onto base, Bellingham lovely footwork from him as well. And he releases Saka down the right-hand side. Saka again, sticking to the right wing here. He's drawing Nathan Ake into him, then plays the pass to Manu, who was challenged by Gatpo, but it bounces to Walker. Manu again, now he has Foden again in that dangerous position, a flick to his left, Bellingham, but then came the challenge, which took it back to Gorky for Berkeren. Yeah, again, but England passing it well. It's a really interesting battle going down this right-hand side for England. The Dutch left-hand side with Gatpo and Saka, and Saka certainly winning that battle at the minute. He just switched on to us, five-lives World Service from the BBC. It is Netherlands won, England won in the semifinal, with almost half an hour play for Berkeren. Long downfield from him, Hart Gage is underneath that, up against Marlon to head it forward for England. Rice keeps it in, over on the left wing, tried to play it in, field towards Bellingham. Now it's forward towards De Pye, who's got some space here, Rice out of position, De Pye, then towards the edge of the box. To Marlon, who hits the shot, that the defenders came together, and Gage put in the block, which deflected it wide of the goal and behind for a Dutch corner. The first corner of the match, Matt. This lad can run. Marlon, he's got some serious pace on that right-hand side. Every time a central player has the ball, he makes his starting run from out to in. He gets the wrong side of the trip here, but Walker reads it so early, gets across. He actually anticipates, it goes to the ground, he just wipes everything out. It's top-defended from Karl Walker, but it's got to be alert to that run. It's a dangerous one for the Dutch. Well, we know that the Dutch can be a threat from set pieces, most certainly. De Pye took the ball out to the right-hand side, but it's actually going to be taken, this corner, this right-sided corner, by Zabby Siemens. Reises his left arm. That noise comes out of the orange wall behind him. An outswinger, which is headed onto the top of the crossbar by Dungfries, and over the top of the bar. Pickford dived up, whether he had that cover or not, I'm not sure, hit the top of the bar and over anyway. Well, the carrier grit, the strength in there, the Dutch with Van Dijk in there, and De Vrij, and we're shouting in there, and of course with Dungfries, who actually gets ahead of it, he climbs really, really well, and I don't think Pickford's getting that. So, 1-1. In England, take the goal kick, Pickford, out to Nenu. And Nenu, the Manchester United teenager, sets off, gives it to Thoden. Now it's all the way out on the left-hand side to Tripier, and then back to Reis. Gloomy skies above the stadium here in Dortmund, as Nenu flicks it to his right to Wauke, and now down the line, Sacher again in a very, very wide position. Nathan Ackett gets tight on it, so Walker is involved. So is Ménu as well, and England are forced by the Dutch back into their own half. And then actually from Marke, it goes all the way back towards. He'll keep that Pickford. I can't tell you how much we enjoy in Kobe Ménu's performance. I have to say, he looks so confident when he gets the ball. His first touch, his pass, and he's driving at players. It's been a top performance from him so far. Here's John Stones carrying the ball forward, lays it out to the left-hand side from the halfway line. Here in Tripier, who lost here with Newcastle United in the Champions League this season. That was a very impressive Brutia Dortmund performance that night. He has folded, then in field towards Ménu. Ménu then picks out Harry Kane, 25 yards out. Kane drives it into the box, cleared away by Van Dijk. Ménu slides in there to win it back for England against Gatpole. Now Sacher on the right-hand side goes for the byline, chips it across the back post, there's no-one there. Tripier's trying to get there against Marlon. The two of them shoulder-to-shoulder, Tripier did well actually to get there ahead of the Shaven-headed Dutchman. Now Rice again, Rice trying to pick out that pass to his club mate Sacher. It bounces up, Sacher's able to chest it down. They've got two men on him now, it goes towards Foden. They want Foden to shoot, and he hits the post! The top-left corner, just needed a little more bend on it. It was so similar to your Mal last night, wasn't it? Identical position, again it opens up. He doesn't need a second invitation, he looks, and he can see the spot and he spots it, and the connection is great. And he's just watching it all the way, and we're thinking, come on, come on, dip, dip, a little bit quicker. Just didn't hit the post and bar. Izzy, you must have had your eyes on that, it was heading right at you. Absolutely superb again for Foden. How much joy is he getting, by the way, off that right-hand side coming in? And it opened up perfectly for him, and there's Strat, I mean, I thought it was Neslin in that. It was a superb strike, you could feel the noise from behind with the England fans urging him to shoot as soon as it opened up. Wonderful effort from him. So Foden strikes the frame of the goal again. I think that's the second time at the tournament. Had the ball in the net, ruled out for offside. He's getting close, Alan. He's playing well, I think they're certainly causing the Dutch problems in there with Maynou and Foden and Bellingham, with their movement in there. Foden trying to get in the hole, and Van Dyke doesn't really know whether to go in tight on Maynou on that occasion there, or sit and try and mark Harry Kane. They're getting joy in there. One-one the score. Here is Foden through the middle. He's leaned into by Rinders, the referee says play on. Maynou's able to take it on, he's up against Van Dyke, and he chips it forward for Cain, but Cain was on his heels, and the ball runs through to Brogan. And with Foden, De Pij is actually sitting down in the middle of the field, so the referee will stop play for a moment or two with the score. Netherlands won, England won, but for Phil Foden, after the season that he's had with the 27 goals that he scored for Manchester City and the 11 assists, he's also had the attempt that was stopped on the line here. He's hit the frame of the goal twice, he's had the ball in the net at the Zoonerman, ruled out for offside, and he's had one stopped on the line. Yeah, he's looked really sharp tonight, much more like Phil Foden, he's getting the ball in really tight positions, and turning and running towards that Dutch defence, and he's really, really unlucky there with that effort. What a great strike it was. He's got the ability, I wasn't... The freedom to pick the ball up in that area where you want it. He's on the right-hand side, which suits him, gets it out of his feet, that left foot curler, and it's just a brilliant hit, but not quite there, and he's just picking up... You can tell he's enjoying being on the pitch more in this role than out wide on the left. Alan, what's your good feeling about what we've seen so far here tonight? I'm really encouraged. I think there's been an energy about their performance, particularly the way they responded after going 1-0 down. They've certainly had that in their game, their pass-ins being crisper, it's being quicker, and they've created chances, so yeah, I'm very encouraged. So 1-1 after Siemens opened the scoring in the seventh minute, and Harry Kane with the equaliser from the penalty spot. Harry Kane, who has now scored 15 goals in his last 19 England appearances. And the Dutch are going to make a change now. Well, it's going to be... Memphis Depaille is not going to be able to continue. So, Joy Vierman of PSV, the Dutch champions, is going to come on into that midfield, so he's taken off Depaille, looks like Marlon's going to go through the middle for the time being, and Ronald Koeman is putting Vierman in there with Reinders and Schouten. So, sort of three-man central midfield, which they have played during the course of the tournament, but that's clearly a reaction, despite the injury to Memphis Depaille. That's clearly a reaction to the way the game is going, the floor of the game. As England have it on the edge of their own penalty area, and Trippier plays it back to Pickford. So that's it for Memphis Depaille, disappointing for it, the end for him after what, 33, 35 minutes on the clock. Here's Mark Gaye for England on the left-hand side. The England fans making themselves heard now. They sense they know that it is England who are on top, despite the fact they went behind in this match. Stones just carries the ball into Dutch territory, drags it back, is looking for the options, goes back to Rice, who quickly works it to Mark Gaye, and he is going to bring the ball forward and give it to Jude Bellingham, and Bellingham now gets his head down and begins to glide out towards the left-hand side, where Trippier will return it to the Real Madrid man, and now Gaye and Detland Rice, and here is Walker in the centre-circle, Kyle Walker, winning his 89th cap tonight, so that's as many as Michael Owen for Kyle Walker. Rice to the left-hand side. Mark Gaye is actually going to carry the ball deep into Dutch territory, and he gives it to Bellingham, and Bellingham now turns back onto his left foot, that uses his right to play it behind Trippier, and he's caught, they hit there, or at least he made it look like he'd been caught there, Bellingham, but the referee was having none of that, and it's out for a throw. I think what he's done as well is put Seamones on the right-hand side and put Veerman in the middle there, just to try and show that midfield up, because England were having so much success in there, as I said, with Ford and Bellingham, and with Meenu. Yeah, they started with this midfield three against Austria in the group when they lost the match, but it is Gakpo now, for the Dutch. Gakpo, but Meenu slides in to cut that pass out, and Seamones was an option there, and actually Declan Rice is going to run away with the ball for England. Just gives it to Bellingham to his left. Dinglenstern side their own half. Fordon, Crossfield pass from him, which bounces up. Sack is able to get it down on the ground. That mention of that defeat to Austria does remind you that the Dutch did finish third in their group, yet are in the semi-finals, and received a good deal of criticism for not doing better than that. But they did recover in the knockout stages with the convincing win against Romania, and the come-from-behind win against Turkey. And my Dutch friends are telling me that Kuhmen's team are very adept at coming from behind. Here is Meenu, picks out a pass. That's stuck to Fordon's right boot, like the proverbial clue. Fordon, though, has Reinders right there with him, so Meenu. Back to Fordon again, he's seen lots and lots of the ball in these openings, 37 minutes, and a little bit more. Rice again, a match level at all square. Rice will just knock it across into the path of John Stones, and then Stones back towards Declan Rice. And then out on the left-hand side, Phil Fordon again, who's stayed out there for the time being. Fordon leaves it to Trippia. Trippia, Kane comes short. So no one inside the penalty area for England, so actually they go all the way back to Gay, who's got the ball halfway inside his own half, in Pickford. They'll actually say to Gay, you know, just let it run. So it's out to Stones, who goes for the crossfield pass. Trippia again, is all on his own out there, Dumfries standing well open. Fordon says, give it to me, and then Fordon runs towards the edge of the penalty area. Meenu, Meenu, over the top two, Walker, Walker chests it down, but had to twist the do-so. Got it right side of the box, gap ball with him, back to Meenu. Meenu puts his foot on it, the flick infield towards Fordon, on his left foot, Fordon, they're all shot, and Krupperman goes down, and makes the save. Actually just stops it, and then holds onto it, counter-he's right. They're playing some really good footballing, the movement is fantastic. They can't handle it at the moment, the Dutch, and the pace of the passing. When someone gets into an area, they're actually firing the ball into them with great confidence. Phil Fordon is really, really enjoying himself out there. I think Meenu is as well, isn't he? Unbelievable stuff from Kobe Meenu, clever. He's winning tackles, he's turning over the ball, he's driving with it, lovely little flick there, just to slip, Fordon in to get his shot off. I mean, he's been outstanding the young Manchester United Central midfield player. Yes, when you see him playing like this, in a match like this, I mean, it's a little bit like La Mignamal last night, as a teenager, as a 16-year-old with Meenu at 19. You wonder why we had that debate for such a long time about who would play alongside Ryze, but a long pass forward for the Dutch, but it's headed down by John Stones, and England could start again, Ryze makes himself available. Fordon wants it in the centre-circle, he's calling for it. Still, Ryze says, yeah, I'll give it to you, but then back to Gae in central defence. Yeah, at the tournament, England obviously tried Trent Alexander-Arnold in there, then it was Gallagher next, and then it was Meenu, but he's certainly catching the eye tonight, the Manchester United man. He is Gae, back towards Harry Kane, who's all the way in the centre-circle now, back towards John Stones. Kane says, yeah, I'll take it, and then Kane hits a pass right for it. That's the trippier to chase, the trippier with the flick. Back to Bellingham, Bellingham is onto this ball. Trippier makes himself available, wider to the left-hand side. Now it's back to Kane again. Kane curls it into the box, that's headed away by Van Dijk. Meenu tries to get there, he does get there. He just possesses Gakpo, and then Meenu blasts the shot straight into the chest of Nathan Acky, and it bounces out of play for a throw down the right. No, he's so bright and so alert, Meenu. I'll tell you what, you mentioned before, we didn't mention the great tackle he put in on the edge of his own box. He's now at the other side, having a pop-it goal from 18 yards out as well. So it's a throw for England, and Walker is going to take... Walker takes the throw down into the ground, bounces up, and as it was played forward, Meenu is in an offside position, but actually the referee says, I'm going to play the advantage here, because the Dutch are coming forward, although Seamans actually played it back towards the edge of his own penalty area. We've got quite a mix in front of us, the orange wall is to the left behind the goal, but there's a real mix of Dutch and English fans down in front of us. As Seamans plays it to the right, he's got too much on that, and it just rolls out of play for an England throw. I can see a woman down there just adjusting her. Probably an airline pilot's hat. Bright orange glitter on the front of it, and on the peak of the cap, she's got it set at a jaunty angle, I noticed. You're going to say something else from that, Joe? Well, she was actually about half an hour before we kicked off, carrying six pints down, not a three-one. No wonder it's at a jaunty angle, then, Alan. Here is Kane, got the ball inside his own heart, just clips it across into the path of Walker. Kara Southgate just appears in that cream shirt down there, and applauds the incentive of the England players. For all of the good play, and all of the near things that England have had in this first half, there is just the penalty to show from it, and in an absolutely ideal world, when they're playing like this in the first half, I'm sure Southgate and all England followers would like to see them ahead before the break. Walker, back towards Rice, Rice just sticks out his chest, uses Jude Bellingham, who will tap it back to John Stones. Maynou, in a very advanced position now, actually wanted the ball from Stones, but here's Thornton, who takes it up on the right-hand side, and then moves in field, gives it back to Stones. Then over the halfway line to Rice. Rice Bellingham says that he wants it. Actually, it goes to Gay, then back to Rice again. There's a much better temple about the England players. We so often say for England, these players, you do feel that moving the ball quickly is so important. Rice back out to Gay on the left-hand side. Trippie, Bellingham makes the run down into the pullback position. He's leaned into by De Vrij, keeps his feet. Bellingham then wins the pullback. Bellingham now whips it into the box, but Van Dijk is able to step forward and clear it away to the halfway line. Good again. Good running in behind from Bellingham. I think they're really controlling the midfield in there, and their movement is causing them all sorts of problems. Kyle Walker now it is, just forward and right of the centre-circle. Suddenly, we get a cooler breeze just blowing around the stadium. And a pinky sunset as well on those dark clouds above the yellow metalwork of this famous arena. Here is Declan Rice. Now, Rice through the middle of the folding. Folding with a scamper. Now, Bellingham turns near the corner of the penalty area. Gives it out to the left-hand side. Trippie is there. Trippie has ball across. Bellingham is just intercepted, but England back in possession. Again, it's Declan Rice, 30 yards from goal. England trying to crank up the pressure. The Dutch lying behind the ball. Bellingham again out there on the left-hand side. Up against Reinders, takes him on, drops the shoulder, goes back towards the byline, then pulls it back to Trippie. Then Rice makes himself available. It's coming square to Walker. It's coming square again to Kane. There's only Kane out there, so he has to chase after it. The England captain Kane under this, to Picayo Saka just outside the right corner of the penalty area. Walker makes the run. Saka, though, keeps possession. Takes it on past Beerman. Beerman still going with him. Saka then over to Bellingham. Now, Trippie on the overlap. Trippie across, but into the clubs of the broken, who makes the catch? That's just what you lose with not having the left footer on the left side in Keir and Trippie, because about 30 seconds before that, there was a ball that was crying out to be put in with the left foot, but he didn't. He didn't come back inside, but then the ball eventually goes back out to him, rather than actually whipping it across, he tries to chip it straight into the keeper's arms. Now the Dutch come forward, a rare attack for them, and it's being brought forward over, just in front of us by Beerman. Three minutes of added time at the end of the first half. And then, Shouten back to Reinders. And the pace just slows with the Dutch in possession. One-one is the score. Here's Nathan Ackie on the left-hand side. The threat is there. Certainly from the set piece, remember the Dumfries header that came off the top of the crossbar. But the Dutch just knocking it around in the central third, probably just enjoying a feel of the ball and some possession. Actually, we haven't seen this for some time in the match. So Beerman will use the captain, Virgil Van Dijk. And then Van Dijk just put the ball back towards the goalkeeper for Brogan. Half-time approaching, we'll have more on the events at Lourdes in the first test. Test match special will be back on air in the morning on Five Lives Sports Extra, with England having a dominant day. And on the subject of England, the rugby union team, you'll be able to hear the commentary live from Eden Park on the second test live from New Zealand on Saturday morning. And a rugby union daily podcast all this week with Chris Jones in New Zealand. And then Simon Seymons for the Dutch, giving it out to Ake on the left-hand side. Nathan Ake, head-loving behind him, Seymons, who set the ball rolling really. I think the goal that he scored almost helped to set the tone for the first half. Such a good finish that it was. Reinders back to De Vrij. And now Marlon out to the right. It goes to Dumfries. Dumfries with Tripp here in front of him. Probably the longest spell of possession that we've seen from the Dutch in the match so far. With still 90 seconds of the first 45 minutes to play. 45 minutes plus. Here's Dumfries. Dumfries up against Tripp here, who steps in, puts in the challenge. And then once again, it is the Dutch who go back to Githrae and Van Dijk, tied up tightly at the back of his head, the Liverpool captain. And then Reinders back to De Vrij again. Into the last minute of added time at the end of the first half. Not sure the Dutch are actually going to go anywhere with this. Let's see as they play it forward to Simon, who's here on the left flank. Nathan Ackie is there as well. Simon has a little flick for the outside of his heel to Ackie. Ackie wants it back. Simon curls it to him. Ackie in with the challenge. Walker as well. And then Walker does well. Bull still in play though. Walker had to be very careful there. Gakpo plays it back towards the ball into the penalty area. Glans on from Ackie, but that will drop beyond the far post and wide. And it's a gold kick. And it remains 1-1 Alan Shearer. It was a good spell of possession for the Dutch one. They just moved it from right to left and then back to left to right. And then they eventually saw the opener and did really well to keep the ball in. And the balls then whipped into Ackie, who just got too much on it, didn't he? Then it was no problem. Just let it go out for the gold kick. I'd imagine that would be half-time then. Matt, a nice little tussle there, right from off there. That plush Manchester City training ground. Walker and Ackie. I'm surprised he kept it. He did really well to get his leg round and keep the ball in play. And there we have it, half-time in the semi-final. Netherlands won. England won as a great orange wave with people rise to their feet in front of us. And he's holding up his blazer as well with the Dutch lying on it. And somebody's giving you a bit of stick, Alan. Short thoughts on the first half? Very encouraged, very promising from England. I think their energy has been much better. Their presence has been really good. And they've created some really good chances, which we haven't seen in the previous game. So, yeah, I'm happy. Yes, extremely happy for me. I thought it was a top performance. Players that have shown up, we're talking about players like Foden. We're talking about Harry Kane. No, we're not talking about Mark Geh, he's been exceptional. He's been a real focus of the early games. But really, you want to be talking about the players at the end of the pitch performing. And I think there's two or three names there that have just been excellent. The first one is Zach has been excellent, drove it right from the off. And Kobe Maynou for me. Wow, what a first 45 minutes he's had. So, a half-time here in Dortmund. Zabby Siemens gave Netherlands the lead. Harry Kane equalised with the penalty. And it is Netherlands won, England won at the brick. I mean, the first thing to say is, I'm not sure who you fly with if you think that's an airline pilot's hat. Village people airways? Let's get down to Izzy Christy. You've been thinking about that, haven't you? Is he Christy? That thing was best 45 minutes at this tournament. Oh, some fantastic football being played there by England. I mean, they were zipping the ball around, they were piercing through the Dutch defence in the middle of it when it was the right time. Foden's come to life, he's been an absolute joy to watch. It's like he's wearing a Man City shirt again. And you've also got to give credit to the Dutch, because I think John just said it there in commentary. They set the tempo for the game, and they brought that side out of England because they conceded so early on to that fantastic goal by Zabby Siemens. But I think England, the fact that we've not mentioned Kodi Gappo is a massive plus, and I think Alan's also just mentioned it there. I was thinking the same, he must have read my mind. This game is crying out for Luke Schaarge. Trip has been fine, he's been absolutely fine, but the amount of crossing opportunities that we're missing and Bellingham going out there, get himself in the box, get Harry Kane inside the box and get the ball whipped in. England's right side, Matt, as you've mentioned, have bossed this. And we've seen, I think in previous games, we've seen evidence of a partnership between Foden and Manu when they are in a similar area of the field. You can see it tenfold tonight. He's fed in the ball a lot, I have to say, that they seem to be on a little wavelength, whether or not it's this side of the pitch, Bellingham tends to peel out to the left a little bit, but Foden, who's sitting more central and to the right, every time Manu drives forward with the ball, it seems to make a little run in, when he slipped him in for his quick feet, and really the ball, I thought it was in, and bang on the middle of the centre of the line. Such a great chance to create it, but between them, they've linked up probably three or four times in this first half to really good effect. He has an amazing awareness, Manu, doesn't he, of when to give it and when to run with it. And there was an example earlier in the first half, it may have been even before the England goal, where he turned inside his own box, and let the ball come across in Manu, and moved 20 yards with it, and took the Dutch press out of it. Yeah, he's aware of everything around him, you know, and what's also impressive is not when he passes, but how he passes it with the pace on it, so it enables to get there, because I said it last night on TV about the Spanish, what they do very well is they move it quickly, but they move it with pace, and when someone pings the ball into you as a player with pace, it's far easier to control. He's been brilliant at that in the first half. He's got a real casual style as well, hasn't he? He's got this relaxed body language, that looks nothing his face. I mean, you wouldn't know that he had any tension, or felt nervous at all. He's got this lovely, relaxed, super powerful when he's on the ball. If the Dutch had got a penalty from that challenge, do you think you would be... ...agreed about it? And also, from that defender's point of view, where he kind of just went... I mean, he sort of went to block it, not challenge it. Kane kicked him, and I know he's got his foot up, right, so you leave yourself vulnerable, but Harry Kane's follow-through has followed his... has volleyed his boot. I'm sure they look at that in the Premier League in overturn. I think if you give it either way, you'd be happy, but I don't think VAR needs to look at that and get into fear with the on-field decision. It was one of them for me. The referee could call it either way, you'd accept it, but he called it as no penalty, stay out of it. I think it's hard to then pull it to pieces on a slow-mo, and then give a foul and a yellow card with ridiculous. Look, there's no doubt that there's contact, but the contact isn't made from the defender. He's actually trying to block the ball and putting his foot up, which he has to do. The then-the-follow-through from Harry, because of the strike, makes the connection. I didn't think that was an absolute howler for it to be turned over. No. Alan, do you think Harry Kane's played the dark arts a bit there with his reaction? Well, do you know what, Izzy? I'm not playing him one little bit, but he's got up and he's taken the penalty, so he's OK, isn't he? I was going to ask you that, because you will have had eyes on him all the way through that, because he was very near you, and he hobbled, and he hobbled, and he hobbled all the way through the referee going to the screen. And by the time he'd done the square, he had the ball of the spot. Yeah, but that's fine. He might have hurt his foot. I mean, there was connection, but the connection was through no fault of the defenders. He's just gone to block the ball. The connection was because of the follow-through, so he might have hurt his boot, but I think it's a harsh decision and giving turning that over. I think they're a bit naughty sometimes when you do kick the bottom of someone's studs. It can be quite painful, right? Maybe. Maybe there's a little element of I'll ham it up a little bit, because he did stay down for quite a while. But the review took some time, didn't it? It was a long, old review to have a look at. One all here in Dortmund, then. Netherlands won, England won, interestingly. On the pitch down below, there is one England sub warming up, and that is Luke Shaw. We will see if he comes on for the second half, but at 5-9. Let's get the latest BBC News. Here's John McKenzie. The Voice of the UK. And the home of the Euros and Wimbledon. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Police have found the man suspected of killing three women in Hertfordshire last night. The victims are the family of BBC 5 Live's racing commentator, John Hunt. His wife, Carol, and two of their daughters, Hannah and Louise, were found with serious injuries at a house in Bushey and couldn't be saved. 26-year-old Kyle Clifford was captured in Enfield in North London this afternoon and is now receiving medical treatment. Hertfordshire police say no shots were fired by officers. World leaders, including Sakiya Stammer, are attending the second day of the NATO summit in Washington. The US says it started transferring F-16 fighter planes to Ukraine. President Zelensky says the aircraft will bring the lasting peace closer. And President Biden has again said that he'll stay in the presidential race after George Clooney said he should stand down. The actor is a long-standing Democratic donor and supporter, but said the party can't win the election with Joe Biden as its candidate. As we know, Jimmy will be hanging up his spikes. We wanted to mark this for the proper sit-down, meticulously researched and planned interview with Jimmy. Are you up for it? 1-0 here at Halftime Endortment between England and the Netherlands. Luke Shaw continuing to warm up the only England sub who is out there warming up. At the moment, let's focus on the first test at Lord England. Close the opening day on 189 for three. So that's already enough for a lead of 68 over the West Indies. Jimmy Anderson playing this last test match, got the final wicket of the Tourists innings. They were bowled out for just 121. But it was fellow for the West Indies. They were bowled out for just 121. But it was fellow fast bowler and debutant Gus Atkinson, who took 7 for 45 to grab the headlines. It was pretty special. I obviously nerves this morning, but once I got the first wicket out of the way, I could sort of go from there and it went pretty well. What was your plan for that opening over, given that you took a wicket with your second delivery and test cricket? Just to get it down there in a good area. Got the wicket. I wanted to bowl it, but it came off well, so can't complain. What was the feeling at the point you got your first test wicket? A bit of relief, to be honest. Nice to get the first one out of the way quickly. So, yeah, as I said, relief and then went from there. There are some more details on the opening day, with former England captain Michael Vaughan and Jonathan Acre. Close the play of the first day, and England very much in control of this first test match. They lead West Indies by 68. They're 189 for three. Having bundled West Indies out for 121. They were 61 for three. They lost 7 for 60 after lunch, including 6 for 18 at one stage, and four wickets with a score on 88. A bit of a disaster there, as Atkinson in his first test match took three wickets in one over. He got his first wicket in test cricket, but just his second ball, a loose shot from Brathwick, the West Indian captain. He chopped the ball into his stumps, and that got Atkinson away. He finishes 7 for 45. The second-best England figures ever by a debutant, and the best in the first innings. And Jimmy Anderson really reduced to the role of an admiring onlooker at mid-on. He took 1 for 26. That was the number 11 from 10.4. It was a wicket for Wokes, who actually bowed rather better than that. 11-0 was 1 for 29. He beat the bat a lot, moved the ball around. Ben Stokes actually was encouraging too. He found some swing. He took 1 for 14. There were some terrific catches in there. Harry Brooks, that is Miss Louis on his debut for 27, a wonderful catch. At third slip, and then Oli Pope as well to catch a hodgepack with points off Wokes. I mentioned a ball really well. Probably the worst ballie ball all day. Cut hard. Should have gone for 4. Pope took a superb catch. So for England, Ducat fell cheaply for 3. Crawley, 76. Pope, 57. At the close, Route 15, Brook, 25. We'll come back tomorrow for some more of the lead-on 68. Michael, your summation of what you've seen today. That's a perfect day from an England perspective. Ben Stokes won the toss. No surprise that he decided to bowl first. The West Indies made a quite good start. It was a nerve, it was, wasn't it? Jimmy Anderson, obviously in his last game, you could tell that there was a little bit of nerves around. The West Indies made a good start. And suddenly when they started to lose one or two, you could see the inexperience, you could see the lack of game time required to play in these conditions. And I will say that if we want the West Indies and these teams to come to the UK to compete, they're not at the standard of what we see from an England side in these conditions. Obviously, I just think they've got to have more game time. Agreed. I just look at that game they played last week. It was against the first-class caret. A lot of young, talented players. Just one game. You look at Schermart and it's not down to the bowlers today. The batter's like the West Indies down to be bowled out for 121 on that surface. Of course, Atkinson, absolutely magnificent. But I just look at the preparation of this West Indies side. I think, couldn't you have come an extra week and couldn't you have given your players two games, at least to get ready for these kind of conditions against the quality that they're going to be up against in the next few weeks? They probably will get better over the course of this Test Match series. But, you know, we really want the West Indies and these sides to come to this. You're shulanchoring a few weeks time to really be competitive and give us a spectacle. It's time schedule. They've got the Caribbean T20. They want the players back for that. I mean, all these things have to be crammed in. I just feel sorry for the players that they just don't seem to get the right preparation for the conditions that they're going to go and play in. You know, we want to see them do very well, but we also want to see a contest. I don't like seeing it. It's been great to see Gorsak and Sinon debut. It looks a real dearly bowl grape. But I don't like seeing days like we've seen today where it just looks so one-sided and we arrive now on day two, which pretty much, let's be honest, we know the result of the Test Match already. And it was just down to the ball didn't do a great deal. It did just enough and it was down to, if you can say to me, there was a jaffa, a genuine jaffa that was bowl today that a West Indian batter couldn't do anything about. I haven't seen it. I just saw a mistake after mistake after mistake. And you have to say that this West Indies side just look ill-prepared to play in these conditions against the quality that they're up against. Michael Vaughan and Jonathan Ang, you've played some more on the TMS pod on BBC Sounds and the team back on air from Lord's at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning on Sports Extra. The team at Wimbledon back on air at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon here on Five Live. Both sets of substitutes now warming up here in Dormund, although Matt Upsons has been keeping a specific eye on Luke Shorin as a warm-up. And look, he's being taped up at the moment. He's coming on. But even based on the warm-up, you said that's someone who's coming on a hard time. Proper warm-up. Lots of sprints, lots of change of directions, movement at the ball, one-on-one with one of the trainers. That is an oncoming-on-to-play warm-up. And yeah, I think he's just getting sorted now. That's an aggressive, I mean, actually, it looks like that Vaghaurs is coming on for the Dutch as well. But from the England point of view, Alan, that's an aggressive substitution. It's like we can do this in 90 minutes here with a bit more width on the left. Yeah, it's a positive substitute because there were two or three times when Kieran Trippier got out there and the ball should have come in. It should have come in quickly. But because he didn't, he was reluctant to use his left foot. He came back on his right and then they went pass, pass, pass over to the right-hand side. On the one occasion where he did try to cross it with a left foot, it goes straight into the goalkeeper's hands. So you're absolutely right. It's a positive substitution. I mean, as a centre forward, there's nothing more frustrating when you've got a great crossing opportunity. You're in the box and it's not getting delivered. I mean, you pull your air out, wouldn't you? If I hadn't, he... And the other thing, just from the Dutch point of view, as he Chris has said, is that Valkvegg-Horse changes things for them, as we have seen in previous games. He's so effective at what he does. It'd be interesting to see who he stands on. If he stands on gay, you're stones, or whether he mixes and matches, depending on where the ball is. But he's a threat and he knows what he's doing. And when the ball's looked into the box, he's so intelligent with the way he nods it down into space for his teammates to run onto. So that is something we definitely have to keep an eye on. Right, John Murray, all yours. Thanks, Mark. So, Vekhorst is on for Marlon. So Marlon's taken off, Matt. Surprised by that? Surprised, because you'd feel that Marlon's almost the perfect foil to be running off of Vekhorst with his pace. I mean, he's had put a lot of energy into that first half, but it's an interesting tap. They really did look like they'd ran out of a little bit of attacking ideas in that passage of play towards the end of the first half. So it doesn't surprise me that Kuhmann's made a change up top. And so, Vekhorst, the Burnley man. Well, I'm not sure we'll see him play for Burnley again, but he's on loan here in Germany with Hopperheim this season. He is on. He's come on as a substitute in every game. And indeed, he came on at halftime in the last match in the quarter-final against Turkey when the Dutch came from behind. And yes, Luxo is on for his 33rd cap after coming on in the 78th minute in the quarter-final against Switzerland. Now he is on at halftime and has both Alan Shearer and Matt Uppsen and Izzy Christensen down behind the goal of said this. It feels like a positive move. The second half begins here under darkening skies. Netherlands won, England won, England in the second half attacking from right to left. So they're attacking towards the mass of orange in the stands here, over 60,000 people. And the majority, I think, are Dutch supporters. Lots of empty seats still at the start of the second half as John Stones is hacked down by Vekhorst. What you're also seeing is Bellingham is playing more on the left-hand side as well, which has then given them more space in that middle for like we saw in the first half in Manu and Phil Ford. And so you'll see a switch, have no doubt, from playing a three and then playing a four at the back with Luxo. I know he's in the forward position at the moment, but he could also play in the four as well, which will free someone else up further forward. This is five-live BBC Sounds. BBC World Service are with us as well. Welcome to you wherever you're listening on what is actually a very pleasant night now. It's a little coolish tinge in the air here, dry at the moment. Manu, very impressive in the first half, plays the full forward, but it's blocked out of play for a throw into England, half inside their own heart. So the Netherlands now, the brookening goal, still the same back four, Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk and Ake. And then in midfield, Schouten, Reinders and Vierman. And then Siemens, Bijkhorst and Gackpul, it is now. And Ronald Koeman used two of his substitutes. And England with Pickford and Gull, Walker-Stones and Gay, Sakaran, Shaw in the wide areas, Manu and Rice in the middle, Fordon, Bellingham and Keane. That was Kara Southgate's first change of the night. Here is Luxo, into the action, having not played since the middle of February. Shaw clips one for it for Bellingham to chase. De Vrij has gone with him, and the ball is bouncing through off the England man for a goal kick to the Dutch and a huge cheer from all of those people behind that goal. I don't mind that though, at least the defenders running towards his own goal, we haven't seen enough of that in any way, in the previous games. It's good to see. So a goal kick that will be tapped square by Van Dijk to Februggen. And then Virgil Van Dijk kicks it away. And the ball is hit forward for the Dutch, but that will just bounce all the way through to Pickford. You're thinking that they've gone to a three. I think England have gone, I think, more to a four at the back, which has certainly pushed Sakaran into a really wide forward position and Bellingham's come to the left of Harry Keane. Yeah, here is Gay with the ball in his back, just taps it forward towards Rice, and then across it goes to John Stones. Again, Stones has been closed down by Begg Horst. Stones gave him a right glare when Begg Horst put in that early challenge on Stones. Begg Horst, before the match came out, he was the first man out, the Dutch players, he went straight to the Orange Wall, he was leading the cheering, as the ball is thrown forward for Sakaran. Sakar pulls it back across the penalty area, but it lands first, shouting. Begg Horst has come back into his own half, Simon's was caught out of position, but he was caught the wrong side of the ball, but then Shaw put in the challenge, took him over, and it's a free kick for the Dutch. I don't think any of the England players thought or expected Sakar to get that ball, because none of them attacked it into the box. He did really well in keeping it in and pulling it back towards the penalty spot. So the Dutch take their quick free kick, and there is Dumfries, who hit the post, the top of the post with a header from the corner in the first half, and then De Vrij, as the root hullet lookalike just walks past us, remarkably like root hullet. Here is Shouten, now to Simon's on the right-hand side, Shaw is able to intercept that pass, Ballinger gives it back to Luke Shaw, England in the white shirts, blue shorts and white socks tonight, and then a nice pass, and then a nice pass to De Vrij, still deep inside his own half-wings, a throw-in of Dumfries. I think you can buy those weeks down there, John, those root hullet ones. Yeah, but he had the moustache as well. Yeah, it might be a nice little addition at some point. Do you think so? Do you think he's come to that stage? Alan? You and Al. We'll get two for the two, but at the base of one, John. Not sure I could see Alan Shearer in a root hullet, but he's got a nice little bit of a strike now. Yeah, Netherlands won, England won, and Orange splashed all around the stands, here in Dortmund, blood light's taking effect. Mark Gay now with the ball at his feet, Harry Kane comes short, Harry Kane equalising in the first half with his 66th goal for England, Long and Ford from Gay looking for the run of Luke Shaw, but that's dealt with by the head of Dumfries, and then Shouten in field, Rice is chasing, and gets a header forward, Forden stretching for it, and then Forden is a judge, who is actually in an offside position, so it's a free kick to the Dutch off inside their own half. Not quite had the flow in the second half, and those changes that Ronald Koumen has made, they were given at times a little bit of a chasing by England in the first half, so it's a tactical response by the wily Ronald Koumen in his second spell as coach in the Netherlands side, and the 20 finals means as he was gleefully pointing out himself that a clause in his contract has been triggered, which means that he'll be coach until 2026 in the World Cup in North America, Northern Central America. Here's Dumfries, left put a ball forward to Beckhorst. Stones allowed it to bounce into him, but Stones takes it away, had to be quick there, then was clipped by Reinders, that kept his feet, and John Stones still with the ball, goes back towards the edge of the penalty area. Such an important man for Garis Southgate over these four tournaments, started every single match, World Cup Euros, World Cup Euros, and here they are again, England, in the semifinal, World Cup, in the semifinal, three years ago, the Euros, remember, England went behind in that match as well, to that excellent free kick from Damsegaard, and eventually against the Danes, won it an extra time when Harry Kane scored from the penalty that was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Here's Rice, then back to Rice again from Shaw, that semifinal victory, England's first tournament semifinal victory since 1966. Rice, across to Gay, England in possession, enjoying the possession, Walker, then out to Sacher on the right-hand side, Sacher again, very, very wide, noticeably wide, Nathan Ackicows with him, so the pass is back to Mark Gay, who will pick out Bellingham, drop a little deeper there, Bellingham receives it, and then sets off, plays the ball in field towards Thoden, Thoden trying to find a position, gives it to Shaw, Shaw's ball across, that's blocked by Gunn-Free, throw nice into play from Thoden, Bellingham, Shaw. That's where you want to get Luke Shaw, he tries to put it in first time, but it's just blocked. Makes England look almost totally different, in terms of the balance, that all tournament. Here's Rice, now to Thoden, again, who is over here to the left-hand side, goes back into the England half, Rice, the England supporters, getting their opportunity to pick out the Dutch fans, Kane bounces to Begg host, and now Reinders will bring that forward, he was took back there by Rice, Reinders though, kept his feet, played it forward to Simon, Simon's the man who scored the opening goal and the semi-final, Reinders then passes between Gunn-Free and Seamhams, and the three of them have a right going each other, out of play for a throw. Begg host wants the ball in early, that's what he demands, Seamhams tries to go around Geary, but there's just no way around him. So it's a throw into England, Begg host certainly has a presence, isn't he, 6'6\". He also, we noticed, had an absolutely massive earring hanging off his right lop, it's like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean, throwing, the shore is going to take, shore up to Kane, but it's headed forward by Diveraille, chested down by Luke Shaw, and followed forward, Bellingham brings that down, Cuman says that was a handball, the referee didn't see it, and then Manu receives it, in a very tight area here, Seamhams puts in the challenge, and Kobe Manu knocks it down the line, to the Dutch half-windside, the score still 1-1, Matt Upsen. Interesting, I think England are close to this 60% possession in this game, which tells you how well we have played, we've been in a different animal with the ball, the confidence, the way the players are zipping it around, the changing information has had an impact, you feel, it is balanced with Luke Shaw, but it hasn't quite got that fluency of the first half, but the Dutch are really sitting in, unless there's a breakaway in that piece, that for me is the only way they can be a threat at the moment. So it is Dumfries, who will just knock the ball back to De Bruy on the edge of his penalty area, and indeed all the way back to Verbruggen, who's made a couple of decent saves, could save from Harry Kane in the early stages, kept out Phil Forden as well, Forden hit the post, had a ball stopped on the line as well, after a brilliant piece of play, the highlights of this tonight, by the way, on BBC One after the news, on the iPlayer, hope you've been enjoying all of our coverage from here in Germany of the Euros, across the various BBC platforms, and here's Rice, just in front of where Garry Southgate is, is watching, the ball is just touched out of play for a throw in that Luke Shaw will take back to Mark Gay, who gets it down, all of the reaction to whatever happens on the football daily at the Euros, when Runeys Euro 2004 on there as well, here is Gay across the stones, now to the right-hand side, to walk out, walk out with a long pass that Ackie gets his thigh to, Kane in on the challenge and Ackie just kept possession, and then used to Vry on the edge of the box, dumb free, says England, press them in there, but up it goes towards Beggos, John Stones with his hands in the back, with the big man, but Beggos does well, Siemens then curves it forward, but Shaw is able to pass it, and then John Stones takes it up again. Yeah, it was good hold of play from Beggos, that's one of the reasons why he's brought in into the game, but there's not enough runners that were going in behind and England had it covered. They've certainly had more possession without carrying that threat that they had in the first half. So England begin to move forward again. Here is the tall figure, Jude Dillingham with those big gaping holes in the back of his right sops, Dillingham again, just 21 to Luke Shaw, then back to Mark Gay, Cobby Manu comes short, still in the central third, then Declan Rice just adjusts himself, and passes it to Foden, who's dropped deep here, Foden looking up, with Thiem in front of him, still Foden, back it goes, and now England try to start again down the right-hand side, Walker actually gets his head down and sets up on a run, and then has to check back, and then back into his own half it goes. They've certainly become more solid, haven't they, the Dutch in the second half. Dillman came on towards the edge of the first period for DePy, Mark Gay, there's a deafening noise that's coming out of the Dutch fans. Now down the right-hand side with the cross from Walker, that is Bob Block bounces away, Cobby Manu gets that down to his feet, Manu, and England again go back towards the central defenders. I think Mark Gay says, just roll it to me, which he does, and Mark Gay is going to take it on through the middle, Cain comes deep, he's the middle of the half at the moment, the England captain, with his yellow boots playing the fall out towards Walker, and out of the right-hand side to Foden, who just moves away from Gatpole, Foden again, with that quick slick footwork that we've seen from the Manchester City fan, player to such great effect in this match. Cain is then challenged by DeVry, who enjoyed that, and it's out of play on the half-way line. Good defending from DeVry, it's the right ball in so Cain just tries to hold him off and then just clip the ball around, but DeVry's having none of it, he's tight and not leaving him at all, it's a good block. Yeah, they're a really experienced pair, those two aren't they, Van Dijk and Stefan DeVry, now Luke Shaw, just down in front of us, White Sox, just three-quarters of the way down his calves, Mark Gay, the Crystal Palace man, such a foot to Foden, Foden on the turn, that's how England and Manchester said he liked to see him play, using Dalligham to his left, now it's Cain, Cain's challenge goes down, DeVry put in that challenge, but took the ball, and even though Cain was on the ground, DeVry said, yeah, play on, and DeVry played for it, towards Dumfries, but that will just bounce out of play for a throw-in to England on the half-way line, Matt. Dumfries just having a complain there, Luke Shaw just checked his run, it was a good ball over the top from the Bruggen, actually, the Dutch winning the ball back, but they just can't seem to keep holding the ball at all, I mean, it's difficult for them, you just feel as time goes on in this game, you can't keep dropping deeper and deeper and defending how they are, I mean, they're packing out the midfield, very much three, sat in their veg horse up on his own, and they haven't got too much of an outlet, so England win the ball back, and then just building another wave of attacks to have to defend, it's very much the pattern in this second half so far. Yeah, the Dutch are sitting in here, a couple of my broadcasting friends who follow the Netherlands I saw them first, and I've seen the Netherlands live at this tournament, so first time I've seen them, asked them what they were thinking about the team, and they said, Kuman, he's such a conservative coach, rolling their eyes, so I think that give you an idea of the sort of reaction that there's been to the Dutch performance during the course of this tournament. Well, it's... Seen the rig of Bell somewhere? Yeah, he said everything when he brought Vierman on for the Pied, and how he looked at it, he thought it was an opportunity to shore things up as opposed to be more offensive, but it might be the smart move, because England, for me, are better. Here they are though, the Dutch trying to break with Gakpo, Gakpo, that's such a good tournament, then plays it to Dung Fries on the right hand side, Gakpo into the penalty area, the Dutch do have shirts in there, in from the left hand side, but he's got far too much on that. And the England fans cheer as it just drifts away beyond the far post, gulking. That's the threat they carry, both with Gakpo and with Seaman's either side of Veghoast, the both of those two either side that have got pace, and then they hope to get into danger areas and then put it into the box for the big man in Veghoast. We're all ready into the last half hour of this semi-final. So, just as I say that, thoughts begin to turn to what they might be after 90 minutes. Here's Foden, Foden inside his own half with Viermans sticking closely to him. Foden there just turns and there's a little bit of a reaction from him, bit of arms flailing from Foden, as if to say didn't have the options that I wanted there. Walker, now Rice makes himself available on the half way line. Rice just moving it from right to left, and then still coming forward. And now here is Mark Gay who's joined the attack from the left-hand side. Foden is available but the Dutch have got everyone apart from Veghoast behind the ball. England are going to have to find a way to take away through this. Bellingham, two Foden, now Shaw back towards Rice again who looks over his shoulder. Rice, now down the left-hand side. Luke Shaw with Seaman's very close quarters to Declan Rice. Foden is there as well in comes the challenge from Shouten but Rice was very quickly in and the referee says that Foden impeded Shouten and it's a pretty good kick to the Dutch half way inside the one half. We're yet to see an attempt on goal, Alan, from either side in the second goal. Yeah, I think England were knocking it around in Shaw and Foden and Declan Rice here down on England's left-hand side but they're actually going nowhere and the Dutch were quite happy to let them press and then on the goal they get the ball back and see Harry Kane just chatting away to the German referee Felix Speyer after that Bellingham might have been caught by a hand by Shouten but Shouten was able to play it back to the Brogdon and now here's Beeman and Seaman's and then Seaman's will knock it back into central defence to Van Dijk I mean they're cancelling each other out for the moment in the second half Shouten back to Deverey Nothing like the thrills and spills and creativity that was still in the first half but here it goes, Shouten with a pass down the right-hand side for Seaman but Pickford will pass it out so Declan Rice has come back almost into the left-back position Declan Rice back to Gey, he just chips it forward out of play and forced error and the Dutch supporters have taken real positivity from that and actually getting it to their feet and cheering their team on so Van Basten's shirt down there as well Pullut and Van Basten who scored the two goals when the Dutch won the Euros here in Germany back in 1988 Gey in with a challenge from behind on Seaman's who goes down and wins the set piece on the right It's just two minutes of sloppy play we set up here on the left-hand side when they're in forward positions, now we've seen it in the defensive area where the ball can go quicker and earlier they get caught on the ball they give it out for a throw and it then comes back in and they give a foul away, it's unnecessary in a dangerous position It feels like it's a dangerous period of play this for England because the momentum they had in the first half has not been carried on into the second and the Dutch now with this set piece that Vierman is going to take from the right-hand side just the bottom of his boots is stood raises his right arm England holding their line just outside of the penalty area referee's in there talking to one of the Dutch players on the edge of the box, it's Van Dijk actually Van Dijk who's standing next to Kyle Walker who I think might be talking away to the Liverpool captain there Kyle Walker Vierman plays this in that's a lovely looking ball and it's Stab Goldich and saved by Pittford what a good save that was have to confess that looked like from Nathan Ackie that it was Goldbound and Pittford leaping to his left pushed it away wide come off death and right you know what I do know is it was a wonderful ball in real hard ball for the defenders and the goalkeeper to handle, but Pittford did really well and pushing it out for the corner Vierman to take this from the right-hand side first big chance at the second half still won the score after that excellent delivery with the free-kick and it comes in a tennered up and over by Dumfries at the near post and it's a goal kick to England you just can't afford to give them any chances you can't afford to try and let them get back into the game and England have done that themselves by giving silly fouls away and silly balls out for Throyens and just giving the encouragement that they may need down to Izzy who's behind that goal yeah the England fans are like called springs actually because they're just waiting for the next moment from England but I blame Ronald Koeman for that because he's been pretty negative hasn't he the way he set the team up in the second half it's kind of just nullified England but we've got to keep believing and staying in it because the fans are firmly behind them that's for sure I suppose headed back to Vogue Brogan on the edge of his penalty area and the Dutch goalkeeper is able to get it away first time downfield and Veg Horst is penalised for his physical challenge on John Stones who goes down Ronald Koeman can't believe it but it's a free kick to England I'm still not sure who that actually came off from the save from Pickford might have been Van Dyke, might have been Rice the two of them together but anyway free kick to England free kick to England and all this is a long ball up the goalkeeper Brogan had to get rid of it but in doing so it's a long ball up and he's trying to fight for it Veg Horst and Stones and at this level international football you're not going to get away with that when you're trying to, your arms are that high Alan England have not been able to get Saka into the game at all in the second half No, they've had a lot of possession but they've done very very little with it hardly ever been in the 18-yard box that caused a threat Here's Rice though, receives it from that free kick takes the ball through the middle, he has Bellingham now squared from him to Kobe Manu Manu, out to the right, Saka just backs away, I think the floodlights were in his eyes there for a moment Saka however was able to control it, Walker back to Manu, puts his foot on the ball Saka in field, Jordan tried to bring that down got away from him, cleared by De Vrij to Veg Horst, Veg Horst all action Stones is in on the challenge, gets the ball takes it away from him however that was straight back to the Dutch and to Shelton who was able to play to the left-hand side but the Dutch just actually almost pulled the handbrake on there instead of continuing to go forward back they go to the half-way line again, a pattern is emerging Here's Simon with Reinders just next to him but he's got a little bit of a backhand Dijk just gets the ball under control on the half-way line and taps it forward towards Reinders Reinders with a little shimmy Harry Kane goes with him, now Dumfries on the right-hand side back to De Vrij and then the fair-head, Shelton again, Nathan Ackie has got some space over there on the left-hand side and now Cody Gatpole on the left wing right foot across deep to the back post Pickford comes, gets his gloves to it there were two Dutch players at the back post but Pickford's touch takes it behind for Kornan Just in the defensive situation England did go back to the back five there and no surprise at all at every opportunity now, the Dutch on the left-hand side or the right-hand side their main aim is to fire balls into the box for the big man Kornan then from the right-hand side yeah it was Van Dijk who got the contact that forced to save from Jordan Pickford two or three minutes ago so one-one the score this is right in the balance again and referee Sviere is again right in the thick of it group of players there and here comes the Kornan the Dutch raise the volume Fierman it's a deep one this time headed goal with Bayer Kepert the whistle had already gone the referee gave him fair warning and I think he's just saying to Pickford what's he saying to Pickford anyway it's a free kick to England it was Fair Corson and Rice that were wrestling at the far post, they had each other by the neck really and as soon as the ref saw that he'd give a free kick for England and rightly so he twisted his head off Fair Corson has certainly put himself about as a friendly embrace very nice very much 50-50 but like Al mentioned I think the referee just looked at it and thought well he's had too high around Rice, Rice was hugging him as well and I think England have to do that on that set place, we've got to be clever I think it's a big problem in those corners and England have to defend them well and be physical, match up against some really good headers of the ball, De Vij, Van Dijk we've got Veghoff standing out, OK done there's some good head in power in that team that's a concern Stones with a long pass there for Belling Chase but it was shabbarded behind by Shouten just watching on the field now over there on the far side, Phil Foulden talking to Pekai Osaka if we're thinking another change by Gareth Southgate, what's the change that is going to swing this back England's way in terms of the domination well because what the Dutch have done they're sitting right back and they've got so many bodies back there, it's very difficult to get the space Shouten's giving it away but Rice's pass forward is harmless way beyond anyone and through to the goalkeeper I was just wondering whether the legs of Watkins would do, you know in terms of running behind, I mean Bellingham's done it once or twice, I know there's not a lot of space in there because they're sitting back but we haven't caused them anywhere near enough problems in this second half compared to what we did in the first half Matt, what do you think, subsoice? I would think Ivan Tony and play two up and you'd have to take somebody out in the middle whether it be Foulden Bellingham or Maynou very difficult to pick who you'd take off but I think Ivan Tony or Watkins like Alimentian but Tony for me I think he's a real threat. It's 1-1 BBC Radio 5 Live, semi-final night here in Dortmund for the right to meet Spain in Berlin on Sunday, we'll have that fully covered for you across the BBC it's live on BBC television and of course here on 5 Live, here is Reinders Reinders back to Siemens, now it's England who are parked inside their own heart Siemens to Ake Virgil van Dijk just turns to his right rolls the pass through the middle to Siemens, that's a little short to De Vrij and Bellingham in on the slide there that's naughty, in on De Vrij and a yellow card comes out for Jude Bellingham and I did wonder for a moment there whether the referee you know, he needs to be really careful because I saw him a minute ago look over to the bench at Gareth and sort of throw his arms in the air, as if to say this is not working Do you not think that when we go to that for one of them has to play this, it's the old issue isn't it, one having to play out on the left Bellingham's been out in here second half He's not comfortable doing it isn't he? And he doesn't look like, you know, it's not where he's at his best and he knows it and he kind of expresses that to be honest So the referee that Jude Bellingham once called out two or three years ago shows him a yellow card here But really, it was a simple decision right decision I think if he's going to do that then he's also got the option of Eze and Gordon as well as he on the left hand side Here is Manu, Manu has challenged illegally so by Gakpo so it's a free kick, Manu very quickly up to his feet there he wasn't staying down and England leave it for the free kick to be taken Yeah, not the dazzling play as it was at times in the first half from England and therefore it's 1-1 and with the play that it is at the moment the pattern that it is, it would not be in the least surprising where this match to go into extra time Manu moving from right to left all the way the pass comes to Luke Shaw, Bellingham makes the run but Shaw goes back towards Rice and there were Mark Gay, Stones Fordham wants it over there on the right hand side, Fordham putting his arms apart on the right flank he wanted that more quickly you can see there his arm goes up again, Fordham Are you a bit surprised the shape's changed from the first half because it's a straight swap for Trippie you think it'd just be more balanced and more aggressive going forwards, it's really surprised me that we have really gone back to our back four Here now, Saka takes on Ake but Ake is able to play that via the England man and it's through for a goal kick and Phil Fordham is not happy he says something to the referee as he walks past him with his hands on his hips Van Dyke says something to the referee Saka is still down, maybe he just got his toe in stood on by Ake but it's a goal kick to the Dutch When you compare in the first half to the second half what we said about all the positives about the quick passing, about the energy and all of those things that were so good we haven't hardly seen any of it in the second half up to now right, thick horse with Gage, might have pulled his shirt there however, Siemens then to Gackporn, then Kyle Walker in with the challenge I think it was the 50-50 the Dutch are in the stands saying that they felt that was a foul but I think it was well timed by Walker Here's Bellingham, gets his head to it on the left hand side but can't keep the ball in play so that's a throw in to the Dutch Bellingham had to be careful there, he's on a yellow card and he passed the ball away he's just got to watch himself in these circumstances a red card I mean that could be pivotal in terms of the way that a match that is poised like this goes Gareth needs to be careful here because he's got a frustrated young football out there on the left who doesn't really want to be there he's just been yellow carded for a tackle he's moaning to the manager to see it's not working at the minute he needs to be careful and have a think about taking him off Now here's Gackporn as the Dutch come forward the game has changed in the second half Reinders Gackporn again running at Bukai Osaka it's back in position it's part of the defence for the time being Reinders, square from him to Schouten and then back to De Vrij with just over 15 minutes to play Dumfries Reinders again who's appeared on the right hand side they're a very industrious three this midfield that the Dutch now have on the field with German coming on in the first half the other one Schouten now to Dumfries Schouten again back into the central area now through the middle Reinders wants it, Siemens the Dutch knocking the ball about as is their traditional style Van Dijk now back to Schouten again Siemens finds a little space on the right hand side Siemens a little dart forward towards the edge of the penalty area from him and then Reinders back to the German and then Schouten with Siemens and still the Dutch just knocking it close passes 10 yards then back towards Van Dijk now out to the left hand side Nathan Ake Gackporn is there as well with his heels on the white line now he's running it Ake is trusted to the area that's headed away by Declan Rice Harry Kane racing for it but can't get there Schouten comfortably there first and the Dutch their spirits are rising here because they're dominating the possession right now in the match and England are on the back foot they've dropped 20 yards further back and they're the one that are soaking up the pressure now they're the ones that are sitting back now England so it is again the Dutch with Schouten De Vrij then is able to come forward and then just tap it square again Reinders turns but Cobby Maynou comes across in front of him Nathan Ake and it is Viamen again in quite a deep lying position chips it out towards the left hand side where Gackporn is up against Walker this time Gackporn's ball in right footed into the penalty area might bounce down for the shot from Seamon's into the ground and then it bounces up and Pikvid is able to hold it comfortably well it's good for Gackporn 1v1 Kyle Walker who decides to come back inside on his right and whip it in there for Begost again and it falls well for Seamon but he just can't get his volley away hits it into the ground which is straight up Pikvid so down pitch side behind that goal to Izzy yeah a really long bit of play with that England had to just withstand and soak up the pressure didn't they Dutch moving the ball really well side to side it was a comfortable save in the end for Pikvid but the Dutch you can see just growing in enthusiasm getting that shot off will bring them confidence without a doubt but how much match is it the way that England are playing that is helping the Dutch confidence yes it's just we've not had the rhythm and then because the Dutch are getting back into it Beghorst has been a brilliant focal point I have to say he's relieving pressure not only getting hold of the ball he's then laying his teammates in and the Dutch have managed to get up the pitch and ride the storm whenever that ball goes in the box they're just looking for crossing opportunities Gackpo one on one he'll shift it onto his right foot and he will whip that in every time knowing that Beghorst and Seamon's are just waiting in the box room the race gave it away but it bounces back for England Parma and Watkins are going to come on for England here's Shaw Shaw now left for the ball across the box headed away by Van Gaik that'll come out to Rice he just has a look to see where Gackpo is and draws him and then gives it to Walker Walker makes ground up the right hand side then back towards Rice yeah it's really had the feel that England needed freshening up they needed substitutes and it is Watkins as you suggested Alan is going to come on and Parma as well so we're going to see a double change the question is who's coming up Forden now, Forden towards the edge of the area now to Walker, Walker's ball in Bacchia Saka to one England offside flag goes up and the goal is ruled out agony for England for the third time at the tournament they've had the ball in the net and the goals ruled out for offside on the one occasion that they do threaten down the right hand side oh that is very very tight that is so tight with Kyle Walker there and he picks out Bacchia Saka in the middle there and he finishes it really really well it's a tight call that is let's just see if it is confirmed yeah confirmed offside the goal is ruled out it remains Netherlands one England one but there we are I mean that's what England have been crying out for for the second half and who's coming off it is going to be Harry Kane so that's it Harry Kane taken off in the 80th minute today and the other I'm not sure if the number has actually gone up so it is Ford and Ford comes off interesting to see what the body language is like here Garry Southgate does go across to him Cole Palmer comes on Garry Southgate has a clasp of hands he puts his arm around him there's a little word between them Harry Kane as well gets a a hug a pat on the back the man who scored the equaliser from the penalty spot so there we are Watkins and Palmer let's see what they can bring Alan yeah well he'll certainly bring fresh legs he'll certainly bring someone who's willing to run in behind which he haven't had that at all other than that one occasion where Walker was just offside and someone who'll chase down and put them under pressure at the back we haven't had that at all well that's what he's doing now Watkins herring around the Aston Villa Top Scorer Bellingham now slides in but De Vrij hit that long Beko's got up and out to the Seamons but Luke Shaw was in and now Mark Gay back to goalkeeper Pickford so Cole Palmer has taken up a position over there on the right side of the midfield on the right side of the midfield and Mark Gay just playing it forward towards Covey Manu they've got less than 10 minutes to go Interesting Bellingham still out on this left hand side isn't it I mean he's operated here but he doesn't look particularly like he's in the zone or that interested in what he needs to do and he's made those two changes but he's still sitting over on this left hand side not really having much impact I have to say I do feel fulfilled Forden and he had a super first half and again he's done everything but score there and then his frustration drew in the second period and it probably was going to be either him or Bellingham in the end it was it was Forden Cole goes back to Pickford then Mark Gay and actually Bellingham has dropped all the way back into the back line almost to receive the ball from Pickford John Stones little ball over the half where line Palmer's first touches assured well struck back to Bellingham into the last 10 minutes reaching the stage of this match where now with the score level at 1-1 on 5 live and the World Service next goal might be enough to take the team into the final whoever is able to score it shouting then back to Reinders Watkins just patrolling the area next to him Palmer as well now Watkins again is putting shouting under pressure and then DeVry goes back to Van Dijk Virgil Van Dijk gets the ball back from shouting and Dijk just stares forward ball at his feet back it comes to the captain shouting virtually part of the back line as England put the press on Shaw didn't quite work there England press again Reiss it is now on DeVry and then on the goalkeeper for Brogan who puts his foot on the ball Cole Palmer over there to Van Dijk trying to play around this Reinders, Palmer chasing after him Reinders still going down the left wing in field that's lovely Ake Reinders now down the right still Reinders his ball across Vogue Veghorst is there excellent challenge from Gea you just put himself in there next to Veghorst and the ball bounce down for Pickford brilliant play from the Dutch the way they move it the way they pass it with base from the goalkeeper right through to defence to the midfield and then into England's back into the defensive area of England and they're looking to get the ball in for Vogue and he just can't get the connection what he wants but it was brilliant passing from the Dutch Netherlands best move of the match one-one the score England have not tested for Brogan in the second half but for all the chances they had in the first period when there was lots of positivity brought Luke Shaw on at half time it felt like that was a positive move but the changes that Ronald Kuhmann made have made it more difficult more awkward for England they've become more difficult opponents to play against Stones long pass from inside his own half Watkins on the chase it's headed away a little slip from Bellingham so Shouten gets there first Bellingham tries to step in in front of that Bellingham goes again now Luke Shaw with Dumfries leans into him Bellingham's there with a flick Shaw is there as well bounces up to Veghorst and the free kick has given England's way Bellingham wins the free kick Seymons is absolutely rating about that you can see why as well that was never a free kick I never thought that was a free kick at all that was a fair challenge however Bellingham reacted by trying to raise the England fans many of whom are down in the stand in front of us here so free kick set piece Shaw actually takes it short to game we're in the 85th minute so extra time not too far away he has Manu Rice stretching and Manu into the challenge the referee says the duch are in possession so he plays the advantage Seymons now clips it out to Gakpo over there on the far side Walker turning in field a challenge by Bukayo Saka sent him flying Gakpo to free kick and Bukayo Saka might be fortunate not to be booked for that set piece he just shoves him in the back doesn't he Gakpo that's their threat there's no doubt about it I said it earlier about Gakpo and Seymons either side of Veghorst and Seymons picking the ball up and he has the options of either Veghorst to his right or to the left Gakpo he picks him out this is a really dangerous area again on the left hand side and you know what's going to happen there's going to be whipped in with pace trying to find one of the big centre halves that would both come up it is a yellow card for Saka felt as though it had to be so we're going to see Theamon playing this free kick again he's proved already in this match that he has a very dangerous delivery the Dutch number 16 standing out towards the left hand side England have got a two man wall there with the delivery into the box lots of movement Theamon plays it in van Dijk on the stretch couldn't get there and it's all the way through Veghorst van Dijk and the referee says goal kick and van Dijk is hopping there and there's a yellow card I presume to be the Dutch captain van Dijk for his reaction to that I understand his reaction because it should have been the corner it was John Storn's that flipped it by referee got it wrong again I'm really surprised with the delivery there actually after seeing his last ball in he just kind of like chips this one up to the back post it was hard to if you're going to get any contact on this it's hard to score with the ball with so little pace on it and he's shown he's got the ability to whip that with real fierce kind of speed to the ball I thought that was going to be the delivery that Theamon was going to put in Are you ready for more extra time with England again Matt? Always John always ready Just though it's heading that way it's John Storn's I must say it's been very good tonight John Storn's Pickford receives it from him and then over arms it out three minutes to go plus added time Gareth Southgate stands down there impassively If it goes England's way over the course of the next half hour you'll become the first man to take England to a final overseas but it feels like it's still quite a long way away Bellingham back to Rice now Oli Watkins Mark Gayne here at the centre circle Walker with a pass out towards the figure of Bukai Osaka challenged by Nathan Aki and then Sakai just sees an opening so he takes it on left foot of Bokai towards the left hand side Shaw is there, gets the ball under control Shaw's ball across Watkins on the stretch Parma shoots across goal wildly sliced it really low fives between Van Dijk and De Vries It's a really good ball from the left hand side from Rookshaw, they switch the play the long ball across and he takes the touch Shaw just puts it into the middle hoping that Watkins is going to get it on the end of it but he makes his run just that little bit too quick and it goes past him but falls to Parma just can't get it on target So goal kick it is and there's just a little lull in the noise around this cavernous stadium brilliant setting I remember watching the Germany-Italy World Cup semi-final in this stadium, that was an epic that went to extra time as well before the Italians shocked and knocked out the hosts this one level up 1-1 Gage is eased over by Gatko, again the Dutch fans are furious that's not a foul no chance, is that a foul I can see why they're furious, the players are Well there's been a feeling among the Dutch fans that this was a bad appointment because of the history so it's in their heads already goal kick then free kick then, England played out towards the right-handside Walker, who's again, as the vice-captain Kyle Walker taking the arm band after Harry Kane went off and certainly Oli Watkins as you suggested would be the case Alan, you know, there is certainly he's brought something to England up front, the movement that he has as Parma is being chased back into his own half, gives it back towards Walker Walker all the way back to Pickford Pickford just allows the ball to roll onto his left foot and then passes it out to Mark Gay almost in the left back position, Gay is being pressed by Simon so plays it back to the goalkeeper, now John Stones receives it from him we're in the 90th minute the score is still 1-1 John Stones Declan Rice comes short and then a stretch by Manu, Parma is able to take up possession of the ball, Parma, lovely ball to Watkins inside the area, Watkins Oli scored Watkins from an impossible angle across for Brogan and into the far bottom corner what a strike that is Ramon Oli Watkins big part in this England squad but the hero of the semifinal in Dortmund what a finish, Netherlands won, England 2 and we're into added time in the semifinal, it seems England are set for Berlin thanks to Oli Watkins that is a sensational finish that's what he offers, he ran in behind, he wanted the ball delivered it was delivered, he took the touch what a turn, what a finish, the keeper's got no chance, he finds the bottom of the net that's what you want when you put a substitute on, you need him to impact the game that's what he brought him on for, for that run, for that touch and for that finish from the England fans in the stands the players on the pitch racing to Oli Watkins and also all of the coaches, Harry Kane the substitutes running down the line some of them came onto the pitch Izzy down pitch side, what was the reaction like from the England fans in the stands Oh my word, they have gone into absolute overdrive the arms, the shirts everything is in the air waving, so many of them are climbing upon the barriers, unbelievable the scenes and there's a red flag going on the Dutch, Ronald Koeman, what an agonising moment that was for him the goal going in just as we moved into added time Oli Watkins well with question Matt you and I when we've been commentating on England matches, whether he had it at international level, he had it there he's answered that question I mean, how quick did he take it, it was like a lovely swivel and hit all in one I just think it caught De Vrij out it was the covering defender going across with that diagonal running to the side of the box, but the speed in which he's turned and hit it it's just caught him off guard right through his legs and it's just nestled just inside the post it's absolutely inch perfect that finish, what a goal listen, there's a rash of substitutions being made now, Saka's coming off, Konza's coming on what you need to know by the way, we haven't said it yet, there are only two minutes of added time of being added on the Dutch are making changes they're going to bring on Zerkse as well, who we might see at Manchester United next season it's a double change, also the young Ajax striker Brian Robby is going to come on, this is his first appearance of the tournament, so Simon's comes off and Colin Gallagat came on for Cobby Mayn who into the midfield we know where this is Bola's going back to the goalkeeper and straight up front England now just trying to organise themselves Konza has gone to the right side of the three so it is very much a back five now for England and I already, we're in the fourth minute of added time now so it's all up to referee Felix Weier how long will be added on, the score, Netherlands England two, Beckholz tries to flick this ball on, Rice now with a stretch, Rice gets it down Rice takes it away to the half-way line past Ake, Col Parma is almost in on this Parma is on this but can't play it square and the Dutch back in possession Konza Gallagat chasing that ball, gets there ahead of Zerkse and deflects it out of play, three and a half minutes of added time have been played there's a yellow card coming out for someone on the England bench who's out of our sight underneath the roof of the dugout difficult to know who that was not sure it was Garry Southgate I think it was someone who was left anyway, we're only seconds away now England seconds away from a place in the final Shaw, heading it forward, another late show for England here with a truly stunning strike a surprising strike from Oli Watkins, Parma gives it away Zerkse through the middle, Zerkse tall, huge pair to Ake, now Gagbo on the left Gagbo's high ball into the England punch of the area to the back post, he's headed across the box, but chested down by Bellingham and Bellingham will just take this away downfield, we're now in the fifth minute of added time, depends how long the referee is going to add on here as Bellingham draws the foul winter free kick in front of the dugout and actually three of the England substitutes, Ramsdale, Gordon and Kieran Trippier come in applaud Bellingham for winning the free kick like that free kick to England they're almost there what a finish Alan what a finish, what a substitution that's what he offers what Harry hasn't been doing Harry has brought different qualities, we know that, he's stuck the penalty away really well but that's the one thing that he can do, that's why he brought him on to upset the defence and it's won the game for England there it is, the final whistle here in Dortmund and Harry Kane races onto the pitch and everyone's running to Olly Watkins the match winner perhaps the unlikely match winner Garas Southgate and his coaches celebrate Jimmy Floyd's hassle bank down there the Englishman against his Dutch nation they go across to Ronald Koeman and they are going to Berlin England are going to Berlin to the final and for the first time England will play in a final on foreign soil what a dramatic finish yet again from England Alan Shearer they had to suffer for large periods in that second half because of the switch that Ronald Koeman made, he got men behind the ball they just couldn't find a way and it was crying out for a substitute crying out for someone that could run behind and ask different questions of the two centre halves because they hadn't done that at all in the second half that man was Olly Watkins and he did it perfectly well the ball into him was brilliant but the touch and the finish were still flying, the keeper had no chance into the corner of the net and it's the England fans that you can hear they might have been outnumbered by the Dutch wall and all of this orange, great disappointment for them and Ronald Koeman who have fallen short here after he changed things quite significantly at half time but Olly Watkins, Matt Upsen has won the day that's unbelievable John to be honest I mean there were moments in that second half where you just felt we're in a bit of trouble here there was probably a ten minute spell where the Dutch really got on top put the ball in the box, a few set plays looked threatening we lost our rhythm credit to Gareth Southgate the changes that he made, how he adjusted it has just worked perfectly and the goal was just a thing of beauty from a centre-four perspective I mean the movement and the swivel and the turn and the hit all in one, it was so super sharp that it was just worthy of a winning goal, it was a cracking finish from Watkins Gareth Southgate just going around all of his players out there there's a huge hook for Cobby Nainu who had such a strong performance in the first half and there we are England have confounded the critics again they will be in Berlin on Sunday finalists runners up at Euro 2020 now finalists again at Euro 2024 and on Sunday night we will have Spain against England for you final score here Netherlands won England two first half and on Sunday night we are going to have a knock-champion again England coming up with drama and tension and Ollie Watkins is on his own in front of the England fans first of all before some of the England players go and join him and the England players let him have that moment in front of the England fans don't the easy he was there on his own for a little bit he was tapping his chest where the England crest is Alan called it in commentary didn't he bring on Watkins but just come on and do that and spoken about in the five live coverage about everybody in this tournament everybody at the place for England and that's Ollie Watkins moment Trent Alexander Arnold had his moment against Switzerland with that winning penalty and to take it and to be ready for it when you need it it's just an unbelievable level of character and resilience and a sense of calm in a moment and the country needed him and Gower Southgate he is owed a lot of credit for the way that he managed that game I'll tell you that they've given Ollie Watkins player of the match they didn't they didn't need to do that John I'm sure he's going to do as many interviews as he gets asked for he doesn't have to do the requisite player of the match one they've sent him again on his own and he's now the singing and dancing down there he's the man who's closest to the stand and really it's taken a while for Ollie Watkins as I was saying for Ollie Watkins you know this is his 14th cap it is his fourth goal but we've never been sure we've never been sure about him in an England show he's never looked quite like the player who's looked so good for Aston Diller who's the collective we there when we've talked about him playing for England yeah but you know he is he's put what he's very very good at it was crying out for that it was crying out for the energy not only just to put the centre hearts under pressure when they had the ball but more importantly for someone to run in behind those two centre hearts are not quick on the turn so when England had the ball in and around it wasn't just the long balls when they had the ball in and around the 18 yard box they needed to turn the defenders and that's what he is brilliant at he's been superb at doing that this season and he needed to do it once and that once is one Englander game that second half I think was really interesting because the Dutch brought on Venkhorst and he gave he gave them an option and Watkins came on to give England an option as well but a different type of option yeah absolutely completely different and Venkhorst I have to say was super effective at what he did and the Dutch found him brilliantly he was a good release when the pressure was on and he played his part but the two centre backs the two Dutch centre backs they loved getting tight the amount of times he gambled to get tight and win the ball or a tight pressure to a player's first touch when they got the back to goal and he was in front when he's running back the other way he's not as happy at all and it showed in that one moment that Oli Watkins exposed it showed and at this level it just needs that one moment and took advantage of it it's so clinical what Watkins did and like Alan said that is his trademark in that sense that kind of run I just watched as well at Southgate going to John Stones Alan didn't he in the second half against Venkhorst and I thought they had an excellent night stones well I think maybe Alan Matt is here you go first Alan probably sums up the two halves the first half you're thinking well Kobe Maynard and Phil Foden are probably England's two England's two players in the match based on the second half you might go Stones actually two very different halves we said it half time about the energy and the confidence and Phil Foden getting in that 10 rolling close and all sorts of problems without doubt it was England's best 45 minutes but it was very different second half because of the change that Ronald Coombs made because everyone sat back and there was no space everything was congested and it was tight and there was a slight change to the system where they went forward the back it was a little bit of surprise and there's no doubt Bellion wasn't as happy as he was in the first half or second half or third without any joy and I was just wondering when the changes wouldn't happen whether it was going to be on 20 minutes to go, 15 minutes to go they had to happen the changes were right and the changes were perfect and that change was Oli Watkins and what a night for him and what a night for England I was struggling with the back the change of formation because we looked so fluid in that first half it was a brilliant performance so many players excelled and we just couldn't hit that rhythm with the back four and bellied him on the left are you alright mate? I'm choking up Chappers, can I just come in there we've been most animated I've ever seen Garos Southgate right in front of me and we'll probably see it later we definitely will see it later on the highlights but we've seen him animated after the previous game against Switzerland he's just taken up another ten notches because there just seemed to be this deep, deep strength within him and he just was fainting to the crowd he was a lit red in me, he said one more to the crowd and the crowd responded to him and there just seemed to be so much that came out of him within that moment and he got he got it spot on, he got it spot on because he recognised, like Ellen described the weakness of the Dutch centre backs the strength then, how do we get on top of that Oli Watkins, he's the man and what did he do, he went on and won the game and it didn't go to extra time happy days well, you don't blame him though, Dizzy is he, you don't blame you don't blame him I mean, two weeks ago they were throwing big plastic skips at him and so on and so forth they've given him stick and by the way that's not just a fan, that's a media thing as well of which role parts are some more stronger in their criticism of him than others but I don't blame him for giving it back, to be honest I'd be giving it back 10 volts to some other people of course I think I'm not sure who's giving it back, I think he was actually enjoying it I think and so he should do he's made a huge decision tonight in terms of the substitution and it's worked perfectly for him, at times yet he's been criticised and rightly so because England haven't performed as they could have and should have in that first half tonight I thought that was absolutely magnificent it was more like what we wanted and then the second half it had to be a different performance he deserves all the credit I've done that you can kind of underestimate what that pressure valve is at this moment in time when you feel a certain way you feel very really passionate or you wanted to prove something wrong and then you do it it's an amazing feeling and I think that that valve just gets open and then that comes out in terms of just relieving that stress and letting people know what you're about and I think he's done that Garry Salker certainly in this game Alan said the decisions that he's made how the team have settled and just weathered that storm early on in this competition I think is you have to give a lot of credit to what that is some lovely moments here at the moment because the England friends and family are just down below us they're above the England dugout which is still got it's still wet on the top I'm assuming that's from all the rain earlier and not from beer that's been thrown over the course of the 90 minutes just on the substitutions in all of this Alan, is that not only was it walking to the finish it was Palmer with the assist it worked perfectly for them I mean those two as I said when you put on as a substitute you either put on to try and save the game or impact the game in a different way we know why Palmer was brought on to try and get that little bit of quality on the ball which we couldn't find in the second half but we also know why Watkins was brought on to upset the defenders to run behind the defenders making use of himself and when he got a chance to put it away he couldn't get any better than that does it these are special moments for these England players and the England staff as well they're not really wanted to leave in front of the dugout with all their family and friends down below us and then what will happen now is that some of those the players will try and go into the tunnel the staff will as well and they'll want the ground just to quiet in a little bit and then they'll be able to come out and spend some time with their family and friends although I would say given by what's going on behind Izzy at the moment the fans aren't leaving the ground for the moment let's go down to the tunnel Gary Flint off what's going on down there a real contrast down here Mark we've got the England players coming in I mean literally they can hardly believe that they've managed to win this game right at the end actually said by Song who's obviously done a bit of work on five lives over the years just giving Kyle Walker a huge bear hook and a big hug for Harry Kane as well but on the other side just saw Virgil van Dijk come through basically his head in his shirt and I think it's safe to say the majority of those Dutch players are absolutely shell shocked they can't believe it they thought it was going to extra time and yet are they Watkins? and the answer for England well look I think we have to be brutally honest as well here for all the celebration and all the joy if we were doing Dutch radio tonight we would be going straight in on the referee wouldn't we certainly for me and he was awful from that point of view I mean certainly towards the end there was a couple of really dubious free kicks that he gave he actually broke up the play or broke up the Dutch winning the ball back and then attacking but I mean the huge talking point is the penalty I just think Dumfries is so hard done by he doesn't actually kick out into the challenge he just puts his foot up and Kane kicks through for me it shouldn't go to the VAR review and it should just be the on field decision I thought it was a real poor use of VAR I'm a Dutch player I'm Ronald Koeman then I'm absolutely seated if you remember when they brought it out they told it was sort of blinding obvious and they're not going to re-referee games that for me was a classic way of re-referring it the referee didn't give anything on the pitch he didn't think it was a penalty I didn't think it was a penalty so then for him to be sent there and overturn it I was really surprised I didn't even see it was being checked to be honest I didn't see it come up on the screen and I didn't assume there was either the other thing that you would say on that though I don't know if you felt it down there is he pitch side is that they allowed themselves to get wound up by those decisions and it's very easy for me to say sitting in the stand but maybe they could have done with the calm head or two in that last ten minutes the Dutch yes yeah you're right absolutely but I think they've got reasons to feel aggrieved because there was a few little challenges where I think it was Codegapo down on that right hand side in the second half he just nicked the ball I think Coby Maynou and he was away and then the referee pulled it back for a free kick and you know the England fans here are not complaining one little bit but that's another reason why the Dutch can feel that way and they'll definitely be going home you know feeling like they were hard done by but that's the presence of England and sometimes that happens and England in the end they played some fantastic football in the first half but we've got to remember we were drawing one all at half time and then it's actually the second half when they didn't play as well England but then we went on and won the game so it's just funny how things work but this team is in a fantastic position now to go and play Spain we will I'm sure look ahead to that final this evening I think we're going to spend a lot of the next few days looking ahead to that final as well let's hear from the player of the match let the winning goal scorer Oli Watkins and in his player of the match interview with Gabriel Clark unbelievable I've been waiting for that moment for weeks you know it's taken a lot of hard work to get to where I am today and grateful that I got the opportunity and I grabbed it with both hands and I'm delighted talk us through the goal I swear on my life my kids life I said to Cole Palmer we're coming on today and you're going to set me up and that's why I was so happy with Cole I knew as soon as he got the ball he was going to play me and you got to be greedy touch and finish and when I've seen it go in the bottom corner it's the best feeling ever and the manager's had a bit of criticism for not making substitutions early enough he's got it dead right tonight look there's been a lot of criticism but at the end of the day we're in the final and that's all that matters we're in the final and to sum it up for this team now you've seen last minute overhead kick equalises, penalties a last minute winner tonight something feels special here yeah exactly we've got that kind of bounce back factor you know going to go behind but we seem to it seems to kick us into gear and we never give up and we've won on penalties we've come from behind yeah one more game now one more game yeah ready maybe let him celebrate first of all the lines are open 4-6-0-6 Chris and Robbie on the way 0-8-0-8-5-9-0-9-6-9-3 I like Holly Watkins predictions there Matt Upsson the confidence but that's what we've seen I suppose during this tournament haven't we? we've seen England's subs come on and change the game I'll be honest I think one of the big things about this group is I think we've got a real a bit of a cocky arrogance about us in a good way not too much but you can't surmise back to the game against the French in the World Cup and that arrogance and belief that they feel they're better and that they can win I think this group has just kind of developed that over the last 18 months we've got a few individuals that are exceeding you know huge levels of performance in top teams across the world and across the board I think we are really confident as a group and it shows in the penalties and it shows in moments like that where we're just doing the right things hitting the right note at the right time in massive moments in games and if you're going to do that and you play well and you've got the players you've got a great chance of winning this thing Alan I feel drained I feel as if I've been out there myself it's a great night I mean at times you know we have to suffer international football it's not ever going to be easy I thought we really dominated the first half particularly after they scored it was a great response they upped their game they passed it in that great energy as I said and then the second half when it got really really tough they had to come up with different answers and they had to defend really well and they had to find a way again and this team has done that without playing spectacular football for four or five of the games they've just done enough when it really really mattered and they're into the final and they've got an incredible chance of winning it tonight for England to celebrate Izzy over the course of the next few days there will be obviously so much preview of the final against Spain which is a nine o'clock kickoff local time in Berlin eight o'clock in the UK we'll have all the build up full commentary course here on 5 Live watch it on BBC television as well and there will be a lot of analysis of England first half England second half and also of other games in this tournament where maybe they've gone off well and then dropped back a bit for that analysis to be fully in depth and fully fair tonight do you actually have to give the Dutch credit and Ronald Koeman credit for how he changed things as well it's not just a one way street is it no it's not and I think the first half we spoke about it before the game didn't we and we've got a lot of build up about the way that the Netherlands plays probably actually going to bring the best out of England because they went for it and I think one of the key moments in the match was Memphis Copaigo and off injured and it forced the Dutch to change their shape a little bit they'd obviously addressed that at half time brought on Valtveggors to essentially they looked like a 4-4-2 from where I'm sat and then just dropped off because previous teams in the tournament have had a success playing 4-4-2 against England they've completely slowed down England's rhythm and they're passing and frustrated us but what we did was we responded to that and I think the previous experiences of playing through this tournament against a 4-4-2 actually helped England in that second half because all we needed was a moment and that happened because of the intelligence of the substitutes that came on and then the impact that they made so it's going to be a completely different ball game against Spain and of course we're not going to go into that now there'll be loads obviously like you say Chappers because Spain's at the ball England might perform at the same level that they did in the first half tonight which is really exciting for the England fans Olly Watkins winner was timed at 89 minutes and 59 seconds which is the latest women's goal scored in a semi-finals at the Euros at all World Cup apparently excluding extra time but it was also England's only shot on target in the second half of this match I mean there might not have been brilliant performances in this but we've had drama haven't we? We can't deny that I mean back to Bellingham's overhead kick penalties that goal it just feels like it's going to be the time I'm going to say it's got that feeling like it's going to happen Naebon the trophy that's how it feels it just I can't explain why when England come would you be as a player and all the superstitions that you have and everything would you be thinking name on the trophy? If I would been through what these players have been through together and come to this point and still be standing absolutely I would because they should and then you're still an England player and someone looks like me interviews you in the billboard to the final says so much you get the names of the trophy Yeah, love that question don't you? I don't get that question from from numbs like you but it just feels right at every moment they've been doubted it's just a great story to this point and why shouldn't it go on? A new lot will happen at media than I saying settle down when I said this post game Whoa Come on Well I don't remember that As I often I don't remember John was definitely laughing at you absolutely laughing at you he's not here to defend himself so we'll have a go at John and I'll wait, I'll wait 5, 9, 9, 6, I'll 3 if you want to get in touch and here is John now he won't defend himself instead he'll talk to Kobe Manu Yes, I won't do that in front of Kobe Manu who's part of an England team that has reached a final on foreign soil for the first time it's an undescribable feeling we're all buzzing it's been such a journey to get here I feel like we've built on all the performances that we've had leading to this point and I feel like the only way is up time to put ourselves into history Feel the first half performance was the best you've shown yet Yeah, I feel like in the first half it was clicking with the whole team everyone was getting on the ball, me, Phil, Decker, Jude we had to feel like we had the game under control in the middle of the park and I feel like the second half we just had to grind out it was tough, but the whole squad was a help the impact of the bench room Cole and Oli, I mean what a finish what a way to end it, so we're just buzzing Yeah, that finish from Oli Watkins that was the man who causes havoc at Aston Villa, wasn't it? Yeah, 100% we've seen what we've done in the season this season so it was the time was coming for him to score like that I knew I could feel it and he did that Kobe, it seems like five minutes sitting down with you in March where you had been catapulted into the senior squad and here we are now Yeah, it's happened quick, but I've just been taking it day by day, game by game and now we're in the European Championship Final so, yeah, buzzing, buzzing What about taking on that Spanish team? Yeah, you know, everyone's seen they're a good side taking on some big teams but we'll be ready for that I feel like we're built up so much now building on the performances and now we're going to be ready for that and give it everything Listen off you go and enjoy it, thanks Kobe Cheers Thank you, Joe buzzing Some kid, isn't he Alan? I mean, just, just, not only as a player but just how he conducts himself how he talks how he takes everything in his strike class, I think everything about him isn't it just the way he sort of handles everything it's, um it's so impressive, he played a huge part particularly in the first half with his, with his passing and his pace of his passing nothing faces him, does it? at all, he just looks so comfortable and at home and everything that he's doing He added an, I don't know if I don't think he said that to John there but he added this when he spoke to TV earlier we're not just here to get to the final and call it quits, we've got a job to do Well, he was my player of the match I, I, I would go with him if I had to pick one out of an England team across the 90 minutes averaging out I thought he was absolutely superb he showed every side to his game tonight he was tackling, intercepting the ball getting into position what he did with the ball he's got this lovely way of letting the ball roll across or he puts his foot on top of it and he sees the space and he just rolls it quickly when he's gone he opens, he's got this kind of big stride he moves up the ground and then he's at the back and then he's slipping passes off he was absolutely superb and that, that kind of body language that he has he looks just, just completely relaxed but for, for player's age I mean he doesn't bear the the, the size of the occasion at all on his shoulder his, his stats is he tonight 51 touches 36 passes completed 2 chances created 100% long balls completed 100% of his jewels won 2 interceptions 2 tackles and that, and that's the other thing and that and Alan I think mentioned it a half time 2 or 3 times in that first half defensively he saved England yeah, yeah those stats are brilliant I was really actually thinking then when you were speaking I'd love to know his stats so thanks for filling that void chappers he, he, he's good for something hang on, is he, is he hold it hold it and just go back down to the tunnel next for John Murray Jude Bellingham yeah it's, it's Jude Bellingham and Jude the, the story goes on and I, I told you last time we lived to fight another day that we, you know, another late goal it'd be nice to score first at some point and have that kind of peace of mind but when you know that you have players coming off the bench are in the starting 11 now, going to go right to the end it really doesn't matter and we know we're always in the game, we know we're going to fight with each other till the end and you know the rewards come if you do the right things and we did that tonight it had a lot of different sides to it that game didn't it? Yeah definitely you know I think even when they scored the first goal I didn't think we were playing badly to be honest it's one of those things where ball turns over and it's a good finish to be fair and yeah we didn't even really take a dip after we conceded it felt like we got straight back into the rhythm of the game and that's probably why it took so quick to get back into it and yeah really happy really proud of the boys, the reaction again the attitude, the mentality the quality is one thing but those kind of characteristics you can't learn in everyday training you get it from experience and each other you know and really proud that it's rubbing off on each other I'm feeling the euphoria here you know England players, Garosław Skic, just to our left but you're here to win the whole thing aren't you? Yeah that's it and you know at the start of the tournament you look at it after a long season you think seven games, oh my god seven games and I think that's the way I've approached it and the game that's gone by whether it's positive negative it's one more down till we get to Berlin and now it's one more game and we're tired you know it's been a long season but it's one more last push for our country for our families for each other and for history really so we'll give it everything And for you it's Spain Yeah one season, the old club in the Champions League final and then the country that are playing in the European Championship final so yeah a weird one obviously you know a lot of the players well had an amazing tournament but you know I'm always confident in the ability and the characters that we have in our change room so it'll be interesting to get them to go toe to toe Jude well done, we'll see you in Berlin See you in Berlin mate Something very amusing about Jude Bellingham calling John Murray mate at the end of that interview I tell you what if Jude Bellingham finds himself at the start of that game on the left hand side I would imagine his teammate at Real Madrid, Danny Carver-Hall might give him an early little hello He may well do and I'm not too sure if Jude will like playing wide out on the left in that game, that was another feature of that second half that you could see that he wasn't too happy but he's happy to do it for the team and he'll do it to the best that he can but whether or not that really does slot in properly I think there is certainly something there but I mean he talks so well doesn't he, he's got such an amazing head on his shoulders for what he's done in such a short space of time and you know that again that belief of this group is going to win it it's just oozing out of the interviews at the moment after the game Is he trying to go back to your clubby menu point? Well yeah I mean just what stood out to me was the two interceptions in that first half really crucial reading of the game there was one that sustained an attack in the attacking third I think the Dutch had cleared the ball and he just slid and just kept the attack alive which I thought was fantastic and there was a defensive one as well in the first half and those were moments where you could feel the Dutch were turning the screw a little bit and for him just to read the game so well and to play with that intensity and that kind of awareness of when to release the ball, when to hold on to it a little bit longer it's just unbelievable for a 19 year old Let's see if we have a positive 606 trail Chris Sutton Oh yeah I mean what a result I'm absolutely delighted Mark especially for Gareth because normally 606s throughout this tournament it's been Gareth has got this wrong, Gareth has got that wrong, Gareth should be sacked I mean but tonight I thought his substitutions were first class taking off Harry Kane you know think about that it's been the main goal scorer for England for however long but being brave enough to take him off getting Watkins on and you made the point Mark about it was a cold Palmer who slipped the pass to him and he deserves a lot of credit for that and I'm with Izzy you didn't listen to Izzy and a lot of people haven't listened to me in this tournament it's not you start the tournament it's how you finish it I'm delighted for Gareth When did you say that? When did you say that? Well as you know Mark I'm always consistent with my opinions Mark and I've been saying the same thing all the way along now Oh yeah but when did you say it? I've said it all along OK Do you think anybody will ring in and find fault somewhere? No OK I've really really how can they find fault in what England have actually done they've got to you know a final I think listening to John Murray the first time England reached a final on foreign soil I've already had a message from one of my friends I haven't got many friends Oh God I'm just looking for a recipe for humble pie and he's one of thousands across the country who have doubted Gareth Southgate and Gareth Southgate has proven them wrong 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 if you want to talk to Chris and Robbie they'll be on their way surely we should get Gareth Southgate at some moment we've done a lot of these games Matt Allen Izzy where we've sat by the family and friends as they wait for players to come out after what has not been a very good evening there are a lot of smiles down there at the moment they've got to embrace it they've got to enjoy it what an occasion and I hope they can they know when we heard from Jude didn't they and said there's one to go but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy tonight because they're under huge pressure and you have to be able to enjoy these moments that's what you're in the game for but also understand they've got one one big game to go it is really important they enjoy tonight actually it is and I'll take that back to the comments Gareth made before the the game and that it's not normal it's not normal that you keep achieving back you know back to back finals or semi-finals I mean these are big moments in any players career from any country but this group of players are doing it consistently we're now in another final to absolutely take a step back and see your family enjoy it embrace it you know they're amazing memories aren't they for these lads and you've got to make the most of it more reaction Harry Kane Inglard Cubs and with Kelly Somers Harry you England players have given them fans some memorable nights over the years but this one's up there isn't it 100% I mean another another semi-final win it doesn't get more special than that so yeah unbelievable tournament so far we've had to show unbelievable character resilience physical strength mental strength which we've shown it all but there's still one more to go and we spoke a lot after the last final about being back here being back to where we belong and going that one step further now we have the opportunity on Sunday it'll be a really tough game of course but you know we can just take the belief that we from the last knockout games into that final now Talk me through the composure you showed for that penalty Yeah it was a it was a long wait obviously with the VAR now we're just waiting to see first if you're getting the penalty and then obviously it takes a bit of time to clear everyone out of the way but I practice them a lot you know it's something that can have a big impact on the game some people just assume they're easy or assume you just get on with it but they take a lot of practice a lot of mental strength as well and yeah of course I was really happy to see that one going Happy for Ollie I imagine as well we noticed that you went over to celebrate and with them pretty quickly Yeah look we're a team all 26 of us we did deep we talked a lot before the tournament about everyone being ready whether you play one minute five minutes whether you don't play at all you can have an impact on this team you can have an impact on this tournament and Ollie was the prime example he's been training well of course he's been itching to get on everyone wants to play everyone wants to get on but we got a world class world class squad so you have to be patient and when your opportunity comes you have to take it like he did today I mean what an unbelievable finish and I mean that moment will live with him forever See you on Sunday Harry Kay with Kelly Southerly with these friends and family because there are some who to a certain extent have been there before in their experience to this you know England obviously have made a final before on on home soil and you know Phil Foden or Declan Rice and you know their family and friends they've been there and seen it Adam Wharton's family and friends over there look like they're having a ride party and I don't blame them Yeah exactly They must think is it always like this Yeah you've got people that are like kind of raising their eyes like oh here again and they're ones that are like wow what's going on all got a fresh round in having a little bit of a dance is pretty I mean honestly I mean what I know he hasn't gone on there but even a penny for his thoughts where he's your former club Alan's starting his season there and now he's in the thick of this Unbelievable What a night where's that guy going that's carrying that thing on his back with us selling the paints We need him here Adam Wharton's friends and family are just keeping him round there he ain't moving Send him over here guys Let's get some final thoughts from everybody Izzy I'll start with you because we should have listened to you all along Don't go there Chappie I remember saying it and I have to have a little word with John Murray if he was shaking his head out me but no I think that was a super performance a lot in it that England can take forward and I mean I'm so happy for Olly Watkins I keep speaking about it it's about moments and you know when you spoke about it there everyone's got a role to play and whatever that is and you've just got to buy into the project and you've got to be ready you've got to be sharp and Watkins comes on he's got one chance and he does it and look who's going to Bill in now Matt the stars are aligning aren't they things are happening this tournament's been like that at the right moment the right thing has happened whether it be a decision an amazing individual piece of skill or somebody's done something the manager's made the right choice it's just all slotting into place and it's building momentum and the performances are getting more assured the confidence and the arrogance on the pitch is there it feels good I just want to before we hear from Alan I just want to go back down to the tunnel have you got with you John mate well well I've got I've got the man who's become the first England manager to take a team to two finals Gareth Southgate congratulations thank you John it's a very special night and hopefully a special night for everybody at home went through the ringer again well I suppose in terms of a late goal but I thought our performance was really good best yet definitely we showed some signs of that in the last game with the ball and tonight we felt that you knew with the Netherlands that they have more quality so they can punish you like they did but maybe a little bit more opportunity to play and I thought our midfield players full folding especially just kept finding the space getting on the ball we had a lot of freedom to play and they had to keep changing what they were doing which meant we then had to keep changing what we were doing so very tactical wasn't it? it was a very complicated game particularly defensively you know Bacchio did an immense job for us he started as a wing back he covered into midfield he defended as a winger at times it was one of those nights where everybody had to be really flexible but the players made so many good decisions on the pitch and on the subject of good decisions substitutions you bring on those two guys Palmer and Watkins and they combined for a stunning goal really no it was I mean we were happy with how Phil and Harry were playing Harry had definitely had the knock in the first half but we've got a good bench we had freshness and we know that Oli can make those little runs down the side which at the beginning of a game can be a problem but definitely at the end can be an even bigger problem and Cole has been showing those moments as well so in many respects there's no way Phil deserved to come off but we just thought a bit of freshness and worth going through it before extra time really and so it's a final in Berlin on Sunday against Spain first time England have been to a final on foreign soil but I'm sensing here in the dressing room area the England players we've spoken to that there is a determination no question I mean this is what we came here to do and we've been building for two years towards this you know we've got to enjoy tonight because you have to enjoy nights like this but equally it's such a quick turn around and we've got a day less than the team we've been the best in the tournament so far so it's going to be a very very tough game but you wouldn't expect to get to a final and it not be so yeah it's fabulous for everybody at home to look forward to where we'll see you in Berlin then thanks Gareth congratulations again some lovely moments down below as well as the England players start to come out Phil Fodos come out to see his friends and family down below as John Soans has one of his children in his arms and assuming he also then gave a big hug to his mom while",
