[0.00 - 5.52] P:1013.83 E:0.090512 |  Central defenders, Toloibre, Bernucci and Achebe, then Di Lorenzo on the right, Di Marco on the left,
[5.52 - 10.40] P:1027.57 E:0.106010 |  Giorgio Ginho with Varela and Cristante, then Raspidori and Scamica of West Ham,
[10.96 - 17.92] P:1610.20 E:0.094925 |  and the England side tonight, Nick Pope, Walker, Dyer and Maguire, James Rice, Bellingham and Saka,
[17.92 - 24.08] P:1585.90 E:0.102925 |  Foden, Sterling and Kane. There was a lovely touch when the national anthem was being played,
[24.88 - 32.08] P:1193.96 E:0.101814 |  that the huge screen on the opposite side of the ground showed an image of Queen Elizabeth
[32.08 - 40.00] P:1141.02 E:0.041321 |  tinged in black and we will have a minute's silence before the game.
[54.08 - 75.36] P:1359.40 E:0.054896 |  Respectfully observed and the Italians also wearing black armbands tonight
[76.08 - 81.92] P:1610.16 E:0.102380 |  and on the subject of armbands as you might be aware the one love armband is being won by Harry Kane
[81.92 - 89.12] P:1477.12 E:0.104398 |  for the first time tonight and he will be wearing it in catap as well along with the captains of
[89.12 - 95.20] P:1340.32 E:0.112653 |  nine other European nations. So it is Italy against England, you're with us here live in Milan
[95.84 - 101.44] P:941.64 E:0.110241 |  at San Siro, England are going to play from left to right in the first half with these new white
[101.44 - 107.28] P:1237.40 E:0.101787 |  shirts with the blue shoulder trim, blue shorts, white socks, there's the whistle from the Spanish
[107.28 - 113.04] P:1462.72 E:0.101785 |  referee, Jesus Kiel Manzanoff and England play it straight back to Eric Dyer who gets his first
[113.04 - 117.76] P:1240.12 E:0.097625 |  touch in international football for almost two years, Rice heads it forward towards Sterling
[117.76 - 122.64] P:1335.39 E:0.093897 |  and the referee spotted an infringement and it's a great kick to Italy who are wearing all
[122.64 - 128.88] P:1241.03 E:0.098016 |  as Uri Blue, the Savoy Blue of Italy, loved the way that they all swayed together, the team
[128.88 - 135.52] P:1021.53 E:0.093740 |  while the anthem was being sung. So Italy in possession the ball played away from the back
[135.52 - 140.48] P:1122.24 E:0.092931 |  towards the halfway line, Kyle Walker wins the header, Harry Kane gets a touch on that,
[140.48 - 146.56] P:1364.78 E:0.096548 |  it's been chased by Foden and the pass back to Donoromak is forced but the big man, the player
[146.56 - 151.28] P:1367.42 E:0.098029 |  of the tournament at the Euros is able to clear it away left footed but England back in possession
[151.28 - 156.80] P:1200.71 E:0.097418 |  on the halfway line. For those who've just switched on, Matt Upsham, just a word on how you feel
[156.80 - 161.04] P:1071.16 E:0.099122 |  about this team that's been picked by Garrett Southgate tonight. I'm excited about it, John,
[161.04 - 165.20] P:1481.13 E:0.101176 |  looking at it when I rode it down and looked at the formation and started to picture how they're
[165.28 - 170.00] P:1450.96 E:0.107592 |  going to play. I think it's a really exciting team, I mean Declan Rice has started really
[170.00 - 174.56] P:1513.75 E:0.099140 |  sharply in the midfield, won an early header, snapped into a tackle, I think the players are
[174.56 - 180.00] P:1422.34 E:0.097225 |  going to be really on the front foot in this game. Italy nil, England nil, three kick to England on
[180.00 - 186.56] P:1164.09 E:0.091786 |  the halfway line, a foul on Phil Foden, just a high foot on him that came in from Tristanse,
[186.56 - 192.48] P:1082.88 E:0.097685 |  so three kick to England. The Minutas-Salons by the way also remembering the victims of the recent
[192.56 - 198.88] P:1146.27 E:0.088660 |  flood in Italy which killed at least 10 people and England take the free kick, square and actually
[198.88 - 206.08] P:1054.83 E:0.097776 |  go back into their own half back to Eric Dyer. So here is a first touch for the Manchester United
[206.08 - 212.00] P:1248.79 E:0.102240 |  captain Harry Maguire, they'll be great, scrutiny on how he fares tonight out on the far side,
[212.00 - 216.96] P:1111.41 E:0.094170 |  left side of the central defensive three, plays it back into Dyer and then back to Walker and
[217.04 - 222.08] P:1477.79 E:0.096231 |  Flail Walker is pointing to Eric Dyer but goes back to Nick Paulp who gets his first touch
[222.64 - 227.68] P:1408.04 E:0.104325 |  or just the one cap for him last season but his first match, England's first match as a
[228.24 - 232.32] P:1314.80 E:0.110235 |  with him as a Newcastle United player and he's in the team so a big night for Nick Paulp as well
[232.32 - 236.96] P:1672.30 E:0.106535 |  tonight than the England goal match. Yeah I think he's got a show that is composed and calm enough
[236.96 - 242.16] P:1376.09 E:0.098266 |  with the ball at his feet, I think he's had a really good season so far, great with his hands and
[242.24 - 246.72] P:1553.94 E:0.120407 |  climbing crosses, a big lad but having the ball at the feet is where he's got to really improve at.
[247.28 - 252.48] P:1399.25 E:0.110903 |  Nice from Scamaca in the centre circle, Borralla now with some space but he over hits the pass,
[252.48 - 257.60] P:1536.14 E:0.108591 |  that is way over the head of DiMarco, the blonde head, the dyed blonde head DiMarco and it's out
[257.60 - 262.24] P:1499.27 E:0.093599 |  for a thrill to England, 10 yards away from their own corner flag which is taken by James back to
[262.24 - 268.88] P:1396.94 E:0.089556 |  Walker, long right footed ball from him looking for Kane but it comes off the head, an Italian
[268.88 - 276.40] P:1341.18 E:0.095189 |  head and through to Benucci who's winning his 117th cap tonight, the great Leonardo Benucci
[276.40 - 283.36] P:1299.60 E:0.100022 |  of Juventus which means that he is now equal with the equally great Giorgio Chiellini and Benucci
[283.36 - 290.00] P:1456.90 E:0.111914 |  sends this pass downfield and Maguire in a poor position and the shot from Raspidori is saved by
[290.00 - 295.52] P:1565.28 E:0.102640 |  Paulp down to his right but actually the offside flag was up and if Raspidori had been able to
[295.52 - 301.44] P:1574.27 E:0.096734 |  find the net it wouldn't have counted but that was uncertain from Maguire. Yeah he was just really
[301.44 - 307.92] P:1419.56 E:0.093675 |  trying to claw him back, I don't think he quite saw the run of Raspidori until it was too late
[307.92 - 312.48] P:1324.65 E:0.102180 |  and Harry Maguire just got the wrong side, yes Linesman's got his flag up so he's offside but
[312.48 - 318.96] P:1297.10 E:0.092681 |  just a little early warning shot you know when you're not really that tuned in in terms of game
[318.96 - 322.96] P:1413.45 E:0.096257 |  ready and having played week in week out it's going to take a little bit of time just to get
[323.04 - 328.88] P:1224.30 E:0.099869 |  that awareness and distance right. That's a let-off for Harry Maguire, yeah I mean yes he was offside
[329.52 - 335.04] P:1534.64 E:0.107137 |  so it wouldn't have stood but you know if it had been valid you know what the marital would have been
[335.04 - 339.76] P:1599.90 E:0.113075 |  and now here is Raspidori again on the edge of the penalty area but Rice was quickly across to
[339.76 - 344.64] P:1721.13 E:0.104417 |  block the shot and the ball ricocheted away out of play for a throw in down the left hand side
[344.64 - 348.40] P:1745.25 E:0.099070 |  near the corner flag. It will be uncertain from Rhys James and Karl Walker there, they've had a
[348.40 - 353.36] P:1530.09 E:0.096623 |  couple of words so far, Karl Walker really remonstrate and I just I think it's too often that
[354.16 - 358.80] P:1535.26 E:0.105099 |  those two players have maybe played together in that kind of situation but I think he's looking
[358.80 - 362.40] P:1656.31 E:0.106284 |  for for Rhys James to get a little bit higher up the pitch and be a little bit more progressive
[362.40 - 367.60] P:1424.28 E:0.115553 |  and look forward with the ball. To Marco River, cross towards the back post and the back post header
[367.60 - 373.52] P:1679.02 E:0.105192 |  from Scammercat was pushed away by Tope it was going in you know and he's got a hand to it and
[373.52 - 378.00] P:1752.63 E:0.102278 |  made a push it onto the crossbar and it was scrambled behind for a corner. Well great run
[378.00 - 384.48] P:1720.34 E:0.099704 |  and leap from Scammercat, this is exactly what he's all about, big target man good in the air,
[384.48 - 387.92] P:1626.52 E:0.102005 |  gets up really well, he has a run on Harry Maguire who's backfelling and I don't even know
[388.72 - 391.76] P:1575.31 E:0.103633 |  if he realises he's going to come and head that ball there, Harry Maguire,
[391.76 - 398.80] P:1535.16 E:0.092685 |  he's had a really difficult opening period in this game. Scammercat has yet to score for Italy,
[398.80 - 403.44] P:1342.58 E:0.105607 |  this is his eighth cap, here's the corner, it comes in, Benucci swings the leg, it was up at
[403.44 - 407.76] P:1429.89 E:0.100103 |  waist high, missed it though, Maguire was there, another cross comes in from the left hand side
[407.76 - 413.44] P:1494.19 E:0.094332 |  from DeMarco, it takes a flick of a head driven back across, only half cleared by Saka and now it
[413.44 - 420.56] P:1670.20 E:0.097551 |  is volleyed away, volleyed away to comparative safety by Harry Kane who is back there inside the
[420.56 - 425.76] P:1787.33 E:0.094092 |  penalty area. What a cross it was from DeMarco though on the left hand side. Well it's just the
[425.76 - 429.68] P:1667.22 E:0.100101 |  type of ball that you know you can cross when you have a player like Scammercat in the box,
[430.24 - 434.56] P:1483.89 E:0.100366 |  I mean his movement was good, he just peeled onto that back post area, he had one or two
[434.56 - 439.36] P:1338.08 E:0.105355 |  strides on Harry Maguire who was backfelling and he just didn't really get off the ground,
[439.36 - 445.12] P:1347.51 E:0.107483 |  Harry Maguire and Scammercat really got up high and above him, he's a good head up, decent save from
[445.12 - 451.60] P:1388.43 E:0.108895 |  Pope. Well Harry Maguire's got a lot of improving to do, if the early stages are anything to go
[451.60 - 457.04] P:1501.46 E:0.108555 |  behind here, Scammercat now, the West Hand man takes it on and shoots from, well best part of 30 yards
[457.12 - 462.56] P:1602.61 E:0.094309 |  and he had options ahead of him to his right and to his left but he went for goal.
[462.56 - 468.64] P:1443.71 E:0.086028 |  And there's a lot of space, a couple of times now Scammercat has dropped into that area and there's
[468.64 - 473.84] P:1368.53 E:0.087160 |  not a centre back that's gone with him and that is the, you know one of the things I thought when I
[473.84 - 479.36] P:1514.80 E:0.082118 |  saw the selection is playing Dyer and Maguire together, it was quite an interesting selection
[479.36 - 484.72] P:1411.02 E:0.093175 |  from Garry Southgate because they're both a little bit similar in kind of the way they play and move
[484.72 - 488.96] P:1478.99 E:0.090507 |  and just a couple of times maybe more reluctant to want to go all the way in tight and leave that
[488.96 - 496.32] P:1240.72 E:0.091714 |  space in behind. If you're wondering John Stones is suspended, he was sent off against Hungary
[497.04 - 503.52] P:1416.22 E:0.098289 |  on that forgettable night for England, forgettable but in many ways unforgettable. England's
[503.52 - 509.92] P:1478.06 E:0.088969 |  heaviest home defeat for almost a century and they've got a lot of improving to do themselves as a
[509.92 - 514.88] P:1556.83 E:0.092557 |  team after what happened that day. He has Walker for England, turns and plays it back to Nick Poulth
[514.88 - 521.76] P:1390.26 E:0.083594 |  who's already had to make that one save, now passes it out to Walker, will also be looking to see
[522.40 - 527.20] P:1652.81 E:0.101740 |  Nick Poulth playing in the absence of the injured Jordan Pickford, what his footwork is like,
[527.84 - 532.48] P:1709.10 E:0.103854 |  he is such a good shot stopper probably in the form of his career. I spoke to him earlier this week
[532.48 - 538.40] P:1578.01 E:0.084892 |  Nick Poulth as Italy play the ball out from the back, DiMarco up towards Walker though for England,
[538.40 - 544.24] P:1478.43 E:0.092150 |  lifts a high one forward towards Harry Kane who pulls it down against Georginho, Tottenham and Chelsea
[544.24 - 549.84] P:1572.71 E:0.103033 |  there and then it goes back from the edge of the area from a chair-beat to the huge figure of the
[549.84 - 556.88] P:1503.53 E:0.090553 |  Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Donnarumma. Now there was a suggestion that he might get a hostile
[556.88 - 562.48] P:1410.64 E:0.095135 |  welcome Donnarumma because of the way that he left AC Milan who of course played our home matches here
[562.48 - 567.44] P:1308.73 E:0.095914 |  at San Siro and I did notice some whistles there from the crowd for the home goalkeeper when he
[567.52 - 572.56] P:1499.97 E:0.105560 |  had a touch of the ball. Here's Jude Bellingham sent a field but he shoved over, challenge from
[572.56 - 578.64] P:1602.76 E:0.103905 |  Raspidori for the Raspidori, sent Jude Bellingham down to free kick, the home fans didn't like that.
[578.64 - 584.24] P:1562.72 E:0.095184 |  No not at all just caught him from behind Raspidori but Jude Bellingham looking to make those runs from
[584.24 - 588.96] P:1503.18 E:0.101424 |  midfield, when the ball gets played wide into the wing back area Bellingham is generally the player
[588.96 - 594.24] P:1419.50 E:0.091159 |  who's on on the move looking to get in that space, drive forwards with the ball, something that England
[594.24 - 600.16] P:1528.95 E:0.092678 |  needs to do better in this game. England with a ball inside their own heart, Italy nil, England nil.
[600.16 - 605.84] P:1726.43 E:0.094562 |  Choice of listening tonight by the way the Bath-Wasks Premiership match is over on Sports Extra on your
[605.84 - 611.60] P:1563.06 E:0.100304 |  digital radio via BBC Sounds. Sterling allows the ball to pass through his legs, Kane was looking to
[611.60 - 616.80] P:1477.65 E:0.099175 |  run on to it but it's tidied up by Benucci who turns it back to Donnarumma, there are definitely whistles
[617.36 - 622.80] P:1492.59 E:0.100622 |  for the Italian goalkeeper, it was rather acrimonious the way that he left,
[624.16 - 630.00] P:1461.49 E:0.094817 |  Italy played forward but Gair is able to step forward and heads away, the attempted pass forward
[630.00 - 637.76] P:1469.68 E:0.090346 |  by Barella, Bellingham gets the ball back, awkward bouncing so he gives it to Sacher on the far side
[637.76 - 641.76] P:1181.52 E:0.093149 |  who takes it down, Declan Rice is there back, it goes to McGuire and McGuire is just going to
[641.92 - 647.12] P:1416.90 E:0.103162 |  knock it across the England penalty area to the man all in yellow, short sleeved yellow shirt,
[647.12 - 654.32] P:1296.31 E:0.085574 |  Nick Polk who passes it back to the Manchester United captain Harry McGuire who has lost his place
[654.32 - 659.92] P:1340.49 E:0.100480 |  in the Manchester United Premier League starting line up and now Italy have the ball back on the
[659.92 - 665.52] P:1448.07 E:0.109650 |  right hand side played forward by Di Lorenzo, now blue shirt four and four, here's the cross but
[665.52 - 670.24] P:1467.12 E:0.104654 |  far too close to Nick Polk, he's there to make a routine catch into his mid-riff.
[671.12 - 675.84] P:1347.93 E:0.102563 |  Interesting start in the game isn't it, Italy really pressing high whenever the ball's loose
[675.84 - 680.00] P:1602.46 E:0.102407 |  and England player gets on it in their own half, there's a swarm of blue shirts really trying to
[680.00 - 684.56] P:1543.64 E:0.093977 |  win it back straight away but England not quite hit their stride yet in terms of with the ball,
[684.56 - 690.00] P:1316.77 E:0.085893 |  the confidence and the passing, you can tell that they've got more intensity about them
[690.00 - 693.92] P:1449.32 E:0.098334 |  but just that little bit of belief and quality and hopefully just come into their game.
[694.72 - 700.32] P:1690.00 E:0.114384 |  That was interesting as well, that last Italian move involving Toloi who's playing as a right-sided
[700.32 - 706.08] P:1611.09 E:0.110219 |  central defender and Di Lorenzo, the Toloi can play as a right back and the two of them working
[706.08 - 712.16] P:1572.78 E:0.101380 |  well together, Di Lorenzo, the Napoli captain and Toloi of Atalanta, England coming forward though
[712.16 - 717.68] P:1414.04 E:0.094726 |  and winning a free kick fell on Sterling halfway inside the Italian half. Well this is an area as
[717.68 - 723.12] P:1431.00 E:0.078831 |  well when you look at the team selection we've got good headers of the ball in the team, you've
[723.12 - 729.28] P:1450.94 E:0.084725 |  got targets like Dyer and Maguire, Harry Kane and I think set pieces is something that could be a
[729.28 - 737.28] P:1419.44 E:0.086328 |  real strength of England's. Well let's see, it's going to be Foden to take this, the Manchester City
[737.28 - 745.68] P:1705.43 E:0.091011 |  man, from, it'll be 35 yards out given the angle over towards the left hand side, England, Kane making
[745.68 - 750.16] P:1646.63 E:0.104904 |  movement towards the penalty spot in it comes from Foden, Bellingham stuck out a leg, it's cleared
[750.16 - 755.28] P:1494.65 E:0.105412 |  away by Di Marco, comes back for Foden, Foden goes through one challenge, Sterling in the box,
[755.28 - 760.80] P:1387.71 E:0.088982 |  takes it out into the full back position and then Sterling, little ball in field, Bellingham
[760.80 - 765.76] P:1308.82 E:0.098802 |  stretches, gives it to his midfield partner Rice and now back again on the left hand side to Raheem
[765.76 - 773.04] P:1385.92 E:0.082712 |  Sterling, Sterling winning his 78th cap tonight, the most capped player in this England starting
[773.04 - 777.76] P:1326.01 E:0.096116 |  line-up, Sterling with it again, his first match for England as a Chelsea man, right foot ball into
[777.76 - 783.12] P:1583.79 E:0.108648 |  the box and there's a back post header actually from Harry Maguire who is still up there, he was
[783.12 - 788.24] P:1640.18 E:0.097084 |  under pressure, he managed to head it on target but it was an easy catch really, it just dropped
[788.24 - 792.72] P:1618.13 E:0.090150 |  into the clubs of Donnarumma. Yeah I like the way he stayed up there, Harry Maguire didn't just drop
[792.72 - 798.24] P:1589.44 E:0.086634 |  back into his centre back position, Raheem Sterling got his head up on the left hand side, shifted
[798.24 - 804.48] P:1823.69 E:0.094028 |  it onto his right foot, saw Maguire and just thought a chip of all over to that back post area
[804.96 - 808.48] P:1675.75 E:0.095562 |  and Harry Maguire like he said won the header but it's a good challenge from
[809.28 - 812.08] P:1355.65 E:0.101736 |  the Italian defender that just didn't allow him a clean contact.
[813.28 - 818.16] P:1204.58 E:0.099211 |  Yeah so it just dropped very gently into the clubs of Donnarumma, looked like he was catching a
[818.16 - 824.48] P:1412.86 E:0.090225 |  tennis ball didn't it with those great big clubs at his, such a huge man all in red tonight which
[824.48 - 830.24] P:1374.86 E:0.089755 |  I think makes him look even bigger, 11 minutes played, 12 minutes played now, Italy nil, England
[830.88 - 835.60] P:1527.19 E:0.092693 |  and England playing it out from the back, England lose tonight they will be relegated from this group
[835.60 - 841.36] P:1552.69 E:0.101962 |  to the second tier of the nation's league but a draw and they were still just about being with
[841.36 - 849.52] P:1778.01 E:0.096710 |  a chance of avoiding that ignominie, England with the ball on the left hand side inside the Italian
[849.52 - 854.48] P:1474.72 E:0.092344 |  heart. Sharp into the tackle at the moment Italy, really are you know when the ball's any second
[854.56 - 860.24] P:1551.77 E:0.088476 |  ball there's a lot of flat out running commitment trying to get to the ball tackling, winning
[860.24 - 866.40] P:1573.59 E:0.082548 |  anything that's dropping in that midfield area. Well they made a strong start, Italy those, the
[866.40 - 871.76] P:1406.61 E:0.091134 |  crosses from the left hand side from DiMarco, you mentioned it to us before the game Matt,
[871.76 - 876.96] P:1561.34 E:0.099046 |  you know that's a real threat that they have but England in possession in the centre circle with
[876.96 - 882.48] P:1757.21 E:0.092463 |  Eric Gaiac just gets the ball back, puts his foot on it, last time he played for England it was also
[882.48 - 887.20] P:1674.90 E:0.103867 |  in this back three with Walker to his right and Maguire to his left in the November of 2020
[887.20 - 892.16] P:1729.93 E:0.103828 |  that's a pure ball across from Reis, beyond Walker and it's out of play for a throw on the halfway
[892.16 - 897.44] P:1449.18 E:0.091376 |  lane, he's better than that. He is, puts his hand up in acknowledgement to his teammate to say yep
[898.32 - 903.04] P:1549.67 E:0.098620 |  that one's on me but I'm liking the look of Eric Dyer on the ball in the middle of that three John
[903.04 - 907.84] P:1570.10 E:0.109705 |  Stirling does well, wins the ball centre field, takes it onto the edge of the box gives it to
[908.32 - 912.56] P:1557.01 E:0.107393 |  right side of the area, Kane goes for the shot it's deflected up in the air forward and jumping for
[912.56 - 919.20] P:1588.26 E:0.108668 |  it but Italy are able to clear and get it towards Scamica on the halfway line, Bellingham puts in
[919.20 - 923.52] P:1356.72 E:0.106623 |  the challenge but Reis is able to cut out the attempted forward pass and now Harry Kane in some
[923.52 - 929.12] P:1438.34 E:0.099277 |  space 30 yards out, Kane goes past Giorgino in into the box and then there is a final line of defence
[929.12 - 933.92] P:1472.64 E:0.103754 |  in Toloi but they haven't cleared it and Bellingham was very nearly onto that but the ball ran to
[933.92 - 939.76] P:1437.41 E:0.109017 |  DeMarco just outside the penalty area in Italy do come forward, Barela now but Barela over hits
[939.76 - 944.56] P:1345.76 E:0.094999 |  the pass, Gronz from the home supporters and Nick Paul has got the ball. That's the second time
[944.56 - 949.52] P:1303.66 E:0.099325 |  Barela has hit that ball, signalling to Scamica, he wants him to peel out, he wants him to come
[949.52 - 955.44] P:1291.15 E:0.089855 |  wide as opposed to to central but I mean if moment of the go is I think it was just taken off
[955.44 - 960.40] P:1276.54 E:0.105878 |  Jude Bellingham's toe wasn't it by Cristante, just got a toe on the ball I felt Bellingham was really
[960.40 - 964.40] P:1739.75 E:0.100983 |  going to get there if he won that ball his first touch was into that kind of D on the edge of the
[964.40 - 971.04] P:1810.62 E:0.088867 |  box and it was a certain shooting opportunity. Italy Nail, England Nail, it's Matthew Upsen
[971.04 - 977.36] P:1329.33 E:0.083429 |  with us here on Five Live inside the San Siro, Matt who played for England at the World Cup and in
[978.00 - 983.92] P:1200.35 E:0.096694 |  eight weeks time Matt will be there, eight weeks today it'll be the week before the World Cup,
[983.92 - 990.40] P:1231.79 E:0.101235 |  England will be there and we will bring you comprehensive coverage, the usual service that
[990.40 - 996.32] P:1331.91 E:0.101825 |  you would expect from a World Cup on BBC Radio Five Live. Sterling is challenged on the halfway
[996.32 - 1002.72] P:1562.43 E:0.101749 |  line by Tolloi and now he has Raspidori and the 22 year old Raspidori turns infield and gives it to
[1002.72 - 1008.72] P:1500.34 E:0.107290 |  Barela on the right hand side, Saka just came across in court his ankles he went down it's a
[1008.72 - 1012.80] P:1650.32 E:0.098889 |  free kick to Italy in a good position out to the right near the corner of the penalty area.
[1012.80 - 1017.68] P:1609.18 E:0.086804 |  Yes definitely a foul from Bacchio Saka just hung his leg out well he was recovering back into
[1017.68 - 1023.36] P:1672.32 E:0.093229 |  position but again the ball given away by Raheem Sterling really nice progressive pass from Eric
[1023.36 - 1029.52] P:1678.17 E:0.080915 |  Dyer I think it was into his feet but England just aren't quite clicking in their passing and movement
[1029.52 - 1032.88] P:1493.65 E:0.088139 |  and support at that moment he's going into the front and they're not really seeing that pass
[1032.88 - 1036.48] P:1530.62 E:0.087900 |  just to offload the ball and the Italians are really getting around them quickly.
[1037.20 - 1041.52] P:1545.02 E:0.096876 |  Free kick on the right so Raspidori is there but also DiMarco has gone across as well
[1042.32 - 1048.32] P:1645.87 E:0.085723 |  those green boots of his green boots blonde hair and he'll be looking to whip this in with
[1048.32 - 1054.96] P:1796.06 E:0.091087 |  his left foot so it'll be dipping into Nick Pope. England have just got a one-man wall Saka
[1054.96 - 1061.36] P:1842.23 E:0.090096 |  forward and is standing three or four yards to the right so Nick Pope has got a good line of sight
[1061.36 - 1067.36] P:1612.10 E:0.098460 |  on this it is DiMarco actually leaves it for Raspidori it's a routine and then it comes back
[1067.36 - 1073.52] P:1480.68 E:0.096230 |  again to DiMarco who does eventually take it it was like something out of the May Day celebrations
[1073.52 - 1078.32] P:1416.99 E:0.085445 |  there I thought it was round and round the the May poll almost like a bit of acting it was like
[1078.32 - 1084.24] P:1507.52 E:0.088903 |  nothing to do with me oh yep now I'm gonna take it DiMarco ran round the ball past the ball
[1084.88 - 1090.96] P:1590.96 E:0.092285 |  then Raspidori ran up to the ball stopped and DiMarco continued his run around in a circle and
[1090.96 - 1097.28] P:1790.48 E:0.097423 |  then hit it in they've won a corner after all of that 0-0 the score five life from the BBC corner
[1097.28 - 1102.88] P:1778.59 E:0.093825 |  from the right hand side here it is it's an out swing at the words the back post and the referee
[1102.88 - 1107.44] P:1421.49 E:0.088381 |  says I think it went did it go out of play before it curled back in or did he spot a push in there
[1108.48 - 1113.12] P:1380.54 E:0.093467 |  it's not entirely clear too short I think it may have been an infringement yeah because it's going
[1113.12 - 1117.36] P:1017.99 E:0.100470 |  to be taken the free kick between the six yard box and the edge of the penalty area so Italy
[1117.36 - 1122.08] P:1112.51 E:0.089290 |  nil England nil um just over quarter runnel a play what have you thought so far that's
[1122.08 - 1127.60] P:1385.07 E:0.086572 |  I think England looked much fresher bit brighter you can see the intent of what they want but
[1127.60 - 1132.40] P:1513.90 E:0.096336 |  just that that quality and the the timing of the movement and the support when the ball goes forward
[1132.40 - 1137.36] P:1588.60 E:0.093068 |  has to be right just there Pope again with a pass just too many misplaced passes at the moment
[1138.56 - 1145.60] P:1668.71 E:0.087015 |  that was um too close for comfort that pass out from Nick Pope just past Raspidori but we've seen
[1145.60 - 1151.84] P:1768.27 E:0.075987 |  a few of those haven't we you know all over the pitch it is ninth captain I think Pope as I say
[1151.84 - 1161.12] P:1802.58 E:0.086251 |  so far in his previous eight caps he's conceded just the one goal that was when England won against
[1161.12 - 1165.76] P:1769.52 E:0.096164 |  Poland and actually it was a it was a poor ball out if you remember when Nick Pope played at the
[1165.76 - 1173.36] P:1623.23 E:0.099353 |  John Stones and Jakob Morda scored for Poland in that qualifier that England eventually won 2-1
[1173.36 - 1178.64] P:1538.22 E:0.101348 |  Italy nil England nil Bellingham has fouled on the halfway line we've got a name for the soprano
[1178.64 - 1188.16] P:1733.99 E:0.083859 |  Matt you'll be very excited it was Carly Paula Carly Pauly who was the the wonderful singer of the
[1188.16 - 1194.72] P:1601.46 E:0.079021 |  Italian and indeed the England national anthem go back on sounds and hear it again it was incredible
[1194.72 - 1200.80] P:1452.97 E:0.101606 |  here is Reese James James being put under pressure by Di Marco but Kyle Walker was there as a second
[1200.80 - 1205.76] P:1407.11 E:0.083989 |  line of defense and it finds its way back to Eric Dyer in the middle of the England half as they
[1205.76 - 1210.00] P:1351.12 E:0.088473 |  come out Maguire is again peeled right over there to the left hand side but he's quickly closed down
[1210.00 - 1216.72] P:1338.18 E:0.083992 |  by Borella so has to come by Scamaker so has to come back in field to Eric Dyer forward from him
[1216.72 - 1220.88] P:1421.58 E:0.094856 |  Phil Forden just gets away from him but James was there and gives it back to Phil Forden
[1221.68 - 1225.28] P:1159.89 E:0.102160 |  such an important player for England for Garis Southgate England team Phil Forden
[1225.84 - 1231.92] P:1229.25 E:0.097591 |  he needs to get the best out of him and he's not scored in his last 13 appearances for England
[1231.92 - 1237.92] P:1356.94 E:0.098245 |  Phil Forden here's Harry Kane on the far side he is challenged he is fouled by Benucci and it is a
[1237.92 - 1243.36] P:1435.81 E:0.095321 |  free kick to England seven or eight yards inside the Italian half in the other match in this group
[1243.36 - 1251.92] P:1402.33 E:0.085599 |  the leaders Hungary have taken the lead in Leipzig against Germany Adam Shalli has scored and it is
[1251.92 - 1258.80] P:1378.13 E:0.090565 |  Germany 0 Hungary 1 goal in the 17th minute England trying to find a pass through to Saka that is
[1258.88 - 1264.48] P:1444.66 E:0.095620 |  intercepted but England have got it back now Saka is it distilling but it comes to challenge on him
[1264.48 - 1269.92] P:1347.45 E:0.105489 |  from Toloi and then Declan Rice slides in and advances out of play in the end for what is given
[1269.92 - 1274.88] P:1579.99 E:0.104778 |  as an England throw referee says the final touches off Borelli he doesn't like that palms apart shaking
[1274.88 - 1279.36] P:1514.08 E:0.090692 |  his head towards the Spanish referee but England take the throw it's very honest from Borella to
[1279.36 - 1284.56] P:1326.77 E:0.088089 |  stay on his feet there Declan Rice comes sliding in doesn't get a piece of the ball at all maybe
[1284.56 - 1289.60] P:1327.31 E:0.098703 |  just a tiny slice of it but not enough to to suggest that he wins the ball and Borelli just
[1289.60 - 1294.24] P:1334.85 E:0.082043 |  manages to almost don't know how he does it actually just misses the contact from Declan Rice he really
[1294.24 - 1299.52] P:1632.94 E:0.085906 |  went to ground and threw everything at that challenge he caught man and not ball yeah that was red
[1299.52 - 1306.56] P:1390.56 E:0.076394 |  card territory but he didn't so uh England in possession inside their own half passing it back
[1306.56 - 1314.72] P:1251.17 E:0.087591 |  to Nick Taub Italy Nell England Nell Taub long ball from him on this occasion but it's right under
[1314.72 - 1320.96] P:1459.34 E:0.085845 |  the chest of Toloi wearing the number four tonight they do wear these golden numbers on their shirts
[1320.96 - 1327.44] P:1440.39 E:0.093524 |  the blue shirts the the Italians the European champions as we cannot forget that they are European
[1327.44 - 1332.80] P:1644.97 E:0.082687 |  champions but have failed to qualify for the World Cup and indeed have failed now to qualify for the
[1332.80 - 1339.52] P:1661.50 E:0.082447 |  last two World Cups. Gareth Southgate just watching down there on the edge of the coaching
[1339.52 - 1346.00] P:1666.72 E:0.094801 |  area he's going for a chocolate brown suit tonight I notice on fashion week in Milan the ball comes
[1346.00 - 1353.12] P:1513.06 E:0.087483 |  back to Walker who turns it to Pope inside the penalty area Pope delays and then plays it long
[1353.12 - 1357.84] P:1365.88 E:0.098491 |  towards Stirling but he's beaten in the air by Toloi and Italy come again but passes somewhere
[1357.92 - 1363.36] P:1411.30 E:0.089921 |  behind DeMarco and it bounces out of play for a throw in to uh to England they're not really
[1363.36 - 1368.40] P:1601.14 E:0.096276 |  building up too much from the back Italy are they it's all very much reactive in terms of turnover
[1368.40 - 1373.44] P:1531.78 E:0.089534 |  winning the ball and then trying to find those passes as quick as they can and catch England out
[1374.16 - 1379.44] P:1525.67 E:0.087514 |  is England really who are having a lot more time on the ball at the back across their back three
[1379.44 - 1387.36] P:1417.17 E:0.084458 |  Eric Dyer seen a lot of the ball so far in this game. Italy Nell England Nell is the score with
[1387.92 - 1393.04] P:1317.41 E:0.098533 |  just over 20 minutes on the clock James scooping the ball forward for Bellingham who's made a run
[1393.04 - 1398.32] P:1411.87 E:0.094289 |  forward gets the ball down under pressure from Benucci think Benucci just had a little word with
[1398.32 - 1402.24] P:1272.26 E:0.101239 |  Reese James off the ball there I don't know what that was about Bellingham now on the right hand
[1402.24 - 1408.32] P:1414.29 E:0.089587 |  side Belling drops his shoulder goes left then goes right gives it to James and then Reese James
[1408.32 - 1414.64] P:1234.64 E:0.087495 |  passing it back towards Kyle Walker who goes to Eric Dyer in the centre circle he's got a kind of
[1414.64 - 1421.36] P:1324.65 E:0.087149 |  it's like a reddish streak in his yeah Reese James yeah reminds me of Dickie Davis world of sport
[1422.16 - 1428.24] P:1324.14 E:0.093049 |  many many years ago what's another one fashion week they're all at it here's Dyer and then Walker
[1428.24 - 1432.16] P:1422.87 E:0.086299 |  goes back to the edge of the penalty area it's actually quite a throwback to see two managers
[1432.16 - 1438.08] P:1230.32 E:0.087982 |  in suits yeah you're very very rarely see that these days I suppose Garo Southgate knowing it's
[1438.08 - 1443.92] P:1574.34 E:0.092464 |  Mancini knowing that it is fashion week Mancini very light gray suit to be the softest Italian wool
[1443.92 - 1449.92] P:1303.24 E:0.089590 |  no doubt as he sets off and sits down on his seat England playing the ball inside their own half
[1449.92 - 1453.84] P:1517.30 E:0.106799 |  not really going anywhere but that's good from Gordon to Bellingham and now down the right hand
[1453.84 - 1457.92] P:1398.67 E:0.107490 |  side to James and Kane's waiting in the middle and here's the cross from James but it's cut out
[1457.92 - 1463.52] P:1569.05 E:0.099443 |  that the knee opposed by a chair he doesn't go out of play it's hiked away by DiMarco and then
[1463.52 - 1468.00] P:1708.44 E:0.104642 |  Bellingham puts in the challenge and it's out for a throw to Italy halfway inside their own
[1468.00 - 1472.56] P:1701.13 E:0.091403 |  half a pause from Garo Southgate down there for that well that's the move that I think's on all day
[1472.64 - 1478.72] P:1608.72 E:0.092790 |  if England managed to get three or four passes off and maneuver that space Rhys James in behind
[1478.72 - 1484.32] P:1506.60 E:0.089406 |  there with his pace is on all day I mean a chairby's not going to want to come out of that area and
[1484.32 - 1488.56] P:1490.23 E:0.087468 |  try and deal with that he's in the box he just gets his cross wrong Rhys James it's kind of in
[1488.56 - 1494.40] P:1386.94 E:0.103362 |  between takes it really early you need to whip that across the face in between Donnarumma and
[1494.40 - 1498.40] P:1476.14 E:0.091493 |  the Italian defenders would have caused the problem but he just doesn't get the right contact on the
[1498.40 - 1505.12] P:1490.94 E:0.084101 |  cross. Scamica is fouled by Dianne of the halfway line so that's a free kick it's interesting here
[1505.12 - 1511.20] P:1521.96 E:0.088443 |  James Horncastle suggesting that if Tiro and Morbillet of Lazio had been fit then it would have
[1511.20 - 1515.60] P:1508.98 E:0.092213 |  been a back four tonight and basically because he's injured they've changed the system. I can totally
[1515.60 - 1520.40] P:1685.13 E:0.090668 |  see that I mean it when we got the team we looked at it and it was very much raised eyebrows as the
[1520.40 - 1526.56] P:1487.65 E:0.088402 |  first time he's played a back three as it as the Italian manager isn't it I think he said so that
[1526.56 - 1530.72] P:1522.30 E:0.101154 |  just shows you how unusual it is. Good from Kane in the centre circle gives it to Foden Foden now
[1530.72 - 1534.96] P:1572.02 E:0.097489 |  nicely rolls the pass to the left hand side to Sterling Sterling now into the pan of the area
[1534.96 - 1539.60] P:1422.65 E:0.101749 |  but two Italians challenge and then Sterling also puts in the challenge in the referee who's just a
[1539.60 - 1546.40] P:1707.82 E:0.091361 |  few yards away so that was a foul on Borrella who went down like a flash but it was a foul
[1546.40 - 1550.88] P:1670.13 E:0.082803 |  yeah disputed by Sterling but it's a free kick to Sterling. Well Borrella really got got his work
[1550.88 - 1556.64] P:1835.21 E:0.082372 |  done early then got in from a midfield position to support Gugginio and Rahim Sterling was it
[1557.28 - 1561.52] P:1672.05 E:0.096302 |  just didn't really make his mind up early enough how he wanted to offload that ball there were two
[1561.52 - 1565.84] P:1518.52 E:0.087518 |  Italian players he wasn't going to go past both of them and just got the ball caught under his feet.
[1566.72 - 1572.08] P:1545.35 E:0.093162 |  As I say the Friday night premiership match is on Sports Extra the score currently Bath Nill Wasps
[1572.08 - 1579.28] P:1455.44 E:0.091317 |  11 and in the United rugby championship Glasgow 7 Cardiff 7 and Lenster 14 Benetton 3 are later
[1579.28 - 1585.60] P:1704.96 E:0.089282 |  scores. Italy Nill England Nill that's a reminder that it is a Friday night here in Milan
[1586.40 - 1593.28] P:1605.54 E:0.089705 |  and indeed everyone else as the ball is played back to Donnarumma inside the penalty area passes it
[1593.28 - 1603.12] P:1527.92 E:0.090748 |  out to Bonucci famously scorer of the equalising goal at Wembley on that unforgettable night for
[1603.12 - 1609.36] P:1298.88 E:0.098508 |  many many reasons at Wembley last year and then Borrella over hits that pass again for no that was
[1609.36 - 1614.00] P:1479.44 E:0.090424 |  Georgino let him off it was Georgino he hit that pass downfield way beyond anyone in a blue shirt
[1614.00 - 1619.20] P:1430.71 E:0.091859 |  so England have got it back Nill Nill. Yes interesting with with Scamica he's held the ball up really
[1619.20 - 1623.92] P:1665.86 E:0.086582 |  well when he's come into him but I just got quite on the same wavelength as the midfield players at
[1623.92 - 1627.52] P:1537.44 E:0.090181 |  the moment in terms of the movement is making a couple of times I've expected him to go somewhere
[1627.60 - 1632.72] P:1752.19 E:0.093729 |  and he's gone in the opposite direction or drop deep when he they thought he was going to go long
[1632.72 - 1638.64] P:1548.52 E:0.100297 |  it's not quite awkward from pulp inside the penalty area with the ball gave it to Dyer he did not
[1638.64 - 1643.60] P:1630.80 E:0.098399 |  look comfortable at all but England have been able to survive that and Rice is carrying the ball away
[1643.60 - 1647.68] P:1550.36 E:0.103003 |  he was being fouled there but England are still coming forward so the advantage has been played
[1647.68 - 1653.12] P:1565.77 E:0.095082 |  Foden now still inside his own half Foden moving from right to left gets it back from Maguire
[1653.12 - 1658.32] P:1523.32 E:0.106547 |  Foden still going low towards Saka but as he peeled away it just took a touch with his right
[1658.32 - 1663.44] P:1483.11 E:0.103393 |  instep that showed it to Italy and now Italy are coming forward on the half way line Tristante
[1663.44 - 1668.08] P:1549.79 E:0.110833 |  finds the ball to the right hand side to Borrella and Borrella's ball into the middle oh that's a
[1668.08 - 1674.80] P:1497.43 E:0.096409 |  poor touch by Raspidori near the penalty spot slightly awkward for him but his first touch it
[1674.80 - 1680.80] P:1464.45 E:0.093630 |  bounced well away from him in England cleared and that was a let-off well Saka was high and narrow
[1680.96 - 1686.48] P:1541.76 E:0.089810 |  when he gave the ball away that reaction from that position when you're playing Wimbach has to be
[1687.36 - 1691.92] P:1655.13 E:0.101163 |  quicker to get back in position because that whole left side was open Italy work it wide there
[1691.92 - 1698.88] P:1594.18 E:0.087908 |  and very nearly created a goal scoring opportunity still goalless here in the Giuseppe Miata Germany
[1698.88 - 1706.16] P:1619.90 E:0.097997 |  0 hungry 1 there's the latest score in Leipzig and the other match in the group and later we'll have
[1706.16 - 1713.76] P:1669.98 E:0.098300 |  news of the tennis the big night for Roger Federer tonight playing his final match before retirement
[1713.76 - 1718.72] P:1494.87 E:0.092642 |  playing in the doubles at the Labour Cup Ruffel Fuller will join us to tell us more about that later
[1718.72 - 1723.44] P:1485.07 E:0.107370 |  here is Giorgio Gigno Giorgio Gigno low ball through the middle to Raspidori telling him in
[1723.44 - 1728.40] P:1573.66 E:0.102200 |  with the tackle on him got more of man than he did of ball and that's given us a free kick
[1729.04 - 1734.88] P:1388.22 E:0.087019 |  around about halfway between the centre circle and the edge of the England penalty area it's a bad
[1736.16 - 1740.48] P:1509.01 E:0.099141 |  challenge from from Bellingham in the sense that it's given a free kick away and a dangerous area
[1740.48 - 1746.40] P:1598.00 E:0.089095 |  didn't need to go out and commit himself Raspidori was always going to have his body in between Bellingham
[1746.40 - 1752.72] P:1750.73 E:0.086158 |  and the ball just looking at the replay of his touch there Raspidori just he had just controlled
[1752.72 - 1756.32] P:1663.66 E:0.101078 |  that with his left foot off that cross it was a real good goal scoring opportunity
[1757.84 - 1765.20] P:1844.61 E:0.102888 |  some more news on Carly Pauli in a minute or two so uh brace yourself for that impressed by that
[1765.20 - 1769.28] P:1709.42 E:0.098556 |  John wouldn't you yeah but first Italy have got this free kick that Raspidori plays out to the
[1769.28 - 1773.68] P:1382.91 E:0.096928 |  right hand side Barella though was quickly closed down by Fordon so he had to give it back to DiMarco
[1773.68 - 1778.24] P:1311.25 E:0.094055 |  groans you can hear the groans from the Italian supporters they wanted that delivered in to
[1778.24 - 1784.80] P:1509.17 E:0.092663 |  Scamaca and that's what DiMarco is looking to do now towards the back post it's pulled back but then
[1784.80 - 1791.68] P:1821.74 E:0.089718 |  Harry Kane was actually in position to to cut out the ball that was volleyed back from the dead
[1791.68 - 1797.92] P:1604.35 E:0.086286 |  ball line by DiLorenzo and the England captain was able to clear it it's still nil nil
[1800.32 - 1806.08] P:1598.18 E:0.095584 |  England's penultimate match before the World Cup Italy playing the ball out towards the right
[1806.08 - 1812.16] P:1365.69 E:0.088192 |  hand side DiLorenzo's onto this and then Napoli captain was able to look for support out there
[1812.16 - 1816.08] P:1267.48 E:0.097050 |  from Barella and then he gets it back but England are forcing him back towards the halfway line and
[1816.08 - 1822.96] P:1300.54 E:0.087901 |  he plays it to the captain that fluorescent green armband Leonardo Benucci. It's certainly got the
[1822.96 - 1828.96] P:1362.96 E:0.091133 |  feel of both teams not quite being at their best hasn't it you know in terms of the quality the
[1828.96 - 1833.04] P:1398.04 E:0.100635 |  pass just in a pass here from the Tristan team perfectly illustrated by the pass from Tristan
[1833.04 - 1838.64] P:1400.23 E:0.093120 |  to get it out of his feet long diagonal I mean it's not particularly difficult passing for a player
[1838.64 - 1843.04] P:1530.11 E:0.099569 |  of his quality and he bashes it straight out into touch and we've seen quite a lot of those
[1843.04 - 1846.80] P:1445.48 E:0.093336 |  instances two or three times he's gone up to Raheem Sterling he's not got hold of the ball
[1846.80 - 1851.04] P:1619.63 E:0.094086 |  it's bounced off him or he's tried to play it first time around the corner and got it wrong and
[1851.04 - 1858.08] P:1851.49 E:0.087728 |  the quality in this game hasn't quite lived up to the opening. The game's really being played
[1858.08 - 1862.88] P:1658.86 E:0.096108 |  mainly between the penalty areas yeah so we've seen the the header from Scamica the back post
[1862.88 - 1867.92] P:1568.13 E:0.100028 |  header that was saved by Pope I think he pushed it up onto the crossbar we've not seen it again
[1867.92 - 1872.80] P:1480.90 E:0.111425 |  here's DiMarco now down the left hand side dangerous again swings the ball in but it comes off James
[1872.80 - 1876.88] P:1639.73 E:0.101973 |  who's only seven or eight yards away and it's behind for what is a corner to Italy from the
[1876.88 - 1883.20] P:1438.88 E:0.091445 |  left hand side this time for England really there's only that Harry Maguire header I think that's it
[1883.20 - 1889.12] P:1439.49 E:0.092443 |  isn't it promising stuff around the edge of the penalty area but it's not no chances really no
[1890.56 - 1895.92] P:1437.07 E:0.095416 |  so a corner for DiMarco to take and he stepped back up the line and then swings it in left
[1895.92 - 1902.32] P:1471.33 E:0.082170 |  foot a bit straight into the gloves of Nick Pope who caught the ball it stuck to his gloves like
[1902.32 - 1908.88] P:1450.03 E:0.082945 |  balloons. He can swing a ball in can't he DiMarco it's got it's got the swerve and that dip as well
[1908.88 - 1913.52] P:1387.89 E:0.088740 |  he hits it quite I don't know kind of kind of flat it's got quite a unique style but he really does
[1913.52 - 1920.08] P:1539.36 E:0.079181 |  get plenty of swerve on the ball difficult to to judge. One of the new internationals made his
[1920.08 - 1924.72] P:1453.57 E:0.097474 |  first appearances in the nation's league in June so this is his fifth cab and this is his home ground
[1924.72 - 1935.04] P:1486.76 E:0.086971 |  plays for Inter does the left back left wing back Federico DiMarco. England with Stirling who goes down
[1936.00 - 1941.60] P:1421.29 E:0.099398 |  and wins the free kick but this is seven or eight yards inside the penalty area it was Toloi who is
[1941.60 - 1949.60] P:1508.45 E:0.084732 |  tight on Stirling but down he went and won the free kick and England played short his Foden
[1950.48 - 1956.48] P:1302.93 E:0.097343 |  Foden followed all the way by Achirby the central defender who now drops back into position as
[1956.48 - 1963.60] P:1474.72 E:0.087591 |  England crossed the halfway line Declan Rice black hair bobbin Stirling now with his white shirt
[1963.60 - 1970.48] P:1482.35 E:0.090310 |  outside these very dark blue shorts goes back to Eric Dyer in the centre circle Dyer looks up
[1971.04 - 1976.64] P:1525.24 E:0.097937 |  Dyer goes long but that's too long for England and Don Gerome just holds out an arm and taps the
[1976.64 - 1981.60] P:1478.22 E:0.106299 |  ball down and still no no I liked it I think it was on and he signaled with his hand to Raheem
[1981.60 - 1986.16] P:1553.41 E:0.104453 |  Stirling and he he put his head in his hands after Dyer because I think he knows he could have hit
[1986.16 - 1991.36] P:1556.74 E:0.098301 |  that ball with the right weight he just over hit it by about 10 yards but he's got the quality just
[1991.36 - 1996.16] P:1435.83 E:0.101004 |  to drop that ball in there it was a straight ball and a straight run which is quite unusually but
[1996.16 - 2003.68] P:1251.68 E:0.094753 |  the space was there between I think it's Toloi and Benucci so Italy playing the ball out from the
[2003.76 - 2007.68] P:1059.75 E:0.101764 |  back it's just in front of their own penalty area played out to Toloi on the right hand side but
[2007.68 - 2014.64] P:1206.25 E:0.090319 |  back it comes to Benucci and Carly Pauly Matt was actually born and raised in Mansfield but her
[2014.64 - 2023.28] P:1402.21 E:0.091644 |  mother's family are from the Elecce so she had the proverbial foot in both caps and boy did she take
[2023.28 - 2029.04] P:1312.68 E:0.091462 |  advantage of that that was the opera singer who sang the anthems before the game Italy Nill England
[2029.04 - 2036.48] P:1190.13 E:0.086921 |  Nill it's been it has been the highlight of the night so far because it's an interesting match
[2036.48 - 2042.08] P:1342.55 E:0.094917 |  but it is not full of thrills and spills no not that's a poor touch as well by
[2043.04 - 2047.04] P:1302.27 E:0.097431 |  by a cheer being the ball bounces out for a throw to England not when you see it on paper
[2047.04 - 2050.80] P:1279.62 E:0.103720 |  and I think you're looking at paper to think oh yeah this this could be quite a good run high
[2050.80 - 2056.40] P:1329.09 E:0.099536 |  quality I know Italy have got a lot of players out but yeah it's not quite lived up to the standards
[2056.40 - 2062.40] P:1273.72 E:0.106343 |  in terms of passing and touch quality so far Walker playing the ball back to Dyer seem an awful
[2062.40 - 2068.80] P:1308.63 E:0.099659 |  lot of the ball on his England return Eric Dyer 46th cap tonight here's Maguire now receiving it on
[2068.80 - 2073.44] P:1248.17 E:0.100777 |  the left hand side and you see Phil Foulden's dropping deeper and deeper all the time to get the
[2073.44 - 2078.00] P:1215.17 E:0.093814 |  ball and try and influence the match and now Sterling doing the same thing as well actually
[2078.00 - 2082.08] P:1041.09 E:0.095254 |  coming back into his own half at England ended up going back to Nick Pope yeah well they're both
[2082.08 - 2086.56] P:1476.11 E:0.097847 |  quite well matched up aren't they in terms of formations and Italy as we said touched on earlier
[2087.20 - 2091.36] P:1329.59 E:0.103930 |  out of possession have been really pressing they've been really getting after England anything in the
[2091.36 - 2097.84] P:1336.83 E:0.094652 |  midfield scammer cut is getting for a lot of work in that front line Roberto Mancini has actually
[2097.84 - 2104.64] P:1369.70 E:0.097921 |  gone with a 5 3 2 which you do not often see these days no Sterling is challenged but that is very
[2104.64 - 2110.08] P:1260.14 E:0.100977 |  tight there very tight the marking from Tolloy on Sterling the ball still in play on the far side
[2110.08 - 2115.76] P:1235.04 E:0.101030 |  and De Lorenzo has got to be careful and Sterling is quickly on to him and Sterling's won a free kick
[2116.72 - 2120.96] P:1267.49 E:0.107400 |  after De Lorenzo with it with a heavy touch there wins the free kick and England have it on the
[2120.96 - 2128.08] P:1315.02 E:0.105671 |  left hand side and when I say it's 5 3 2 Raspidori is either up alongside Scammercourt or he's then
[2128.08 - 2132.40] P:1457.13 E:0.107998 |  dropping very quickly back into the midfield isn't he yeah he's playing to it I think when you play
[2132.40 - 2137.84] P:1317.41 E:0.103467 |  as a centre forward like Scammercourt probably does make sense to play one up alongside him
[2137.84 - 2142.56] P:1266.79 E:0.101805 |  because he's going to hold the ball up really well with knockdowns flick-ons and to have a player
[2142.56 - 2147.60] P:1461.55 E:0.104390 |  running off him could be a real asset free kick wide on the left but England have sent the big man up
[2148.40 - 2152.96] P:1458.91 E:0.110764 |  and here is the delivery from Thornton in towards the penalty spot Kane got his head to it but glanced
[2152.96 - 2158.40] P:1371.16 E:0.106611 |  it across the box it comes out to James who shoots and the deflection takes it right across the penalty
[2158.40 - 2163.44] P:1465.42 E:0.100066 |  area I think it shook your corner we had a great view of that yeah actually we saw that it took a
[2163.44 - 2168.96] P:1408.29 E:0.099153 |  touch off an Italian leg or body on its way behind but the referee didn't have that angle no
[2168.96 - 2174.48] P:1263.95 E:0.100255 |  and he's guessed basically he has guessed it's given a goal kick I like the fact that I think it was a
[2174.48 - 2179.44] P:1370.83 E:0.098802 |  Christanti put his foot out and it clearly just came off a bit you know significant deflection off
[2179.44 - 2186.08] P:1371.12 E:0.097537 |  of him but I like the way that Rhys James had his first touch and wanted to to shoot in that situation
[2186.08 - 2190.88] P:1201.99 E:0.095301 |  we've seen him hit balls from that area of the pitch before and be really successful scored some
[2190.88 - 2195.20] P:1253.83 E:0.098412 |  really good goals from just outside the box Rhys James yes he has not scored for England yet this
[2195.20 - 2201.68] P:1120.63 E:0.101462 |  is his 14th cap but it's Matt's six goals for Chelsea last season Italy nail England nail
[2202.24 - 2206.32] P:1166.94 E:0.103378 |  England could really do with winning this game and they certainly can't afford to lose it otherwise
[2206.32 - 2210.08] P:1412.11 E:0.106730 |  they'd be relegated for the second tier of the nation's league Bellingham as England have it on the
[2210.08 - 2214.64] P:1470.06 E:0.107646 |  right hand side into Kane Kane plays it into Benuccio and there is Shins and it bounces behind
[2214.64 - 2220.48] P:1609.71 E:0.093415 |  and this is a corner for England their first of the match yeah I didn't quite want to miss Benuccio
[2220.48 - 2224.64] P:1382.06 E:0.101495 |  there really Harry Kane there was enough distance between them Benuccio came out and
[2225.44 - 2230.80] P:1264.94 E:0.100392 |  tried to block the most obvious angle across the box but I thought Kane maybe just going to pull
[2230.80 - 2235.36] P:1349.12 E:0.107036 |  that one back a little bit onto the penalty spot area for any England player arriving in the box
[2236.16 - 2240.00] P:1446.43 E:0.108478 |  Rhys James has come across to take this corner this is at the end where the England fans are
[2240.00 - 2246.88] P:1472.85 E:0.108895 |  right up near the the spotlight under the roof a good couple of thousand of them up there with
[2247.68 - 2252.40] P:1338.35 E:0.105906 |  the flags James takes the corner it's headed by Dyer across the box cleared by Italy comes out to
[2252.40 - 2258.32] P:1457.90 E:0.103727 |  Foden nice footwork it's played by Maguire back out to James James Cross is intercepted by the
[2258.32 - 2262.88] P:1632.65 E:0.109378 |  outstretched left foot of DiMarco and that is behind for another England corner good from England
[2262.88 - 2269.28] P:1535.87 E:0.096824 |  yeah lovely little lift of the ball from Phil Foden he had his touch it was so tight no space
[2269.28 - 2273.92] P:1320.67 E:0.101626 |  a tour and an Italian player came out and he just lifted the ball over his feet lovely
[2274.48 - 2278.72] P:1412.18 E:0.105399 |  got him behind him and then another cross from Rhys James it was blocked so a second
[2278.72 - 2283.76] P:1336.23 E:0.098316 |  almost second consecutive corner from the right James raises his right arm and it goes to the
[2283.76 - 2288.00] P:1388.07 E:0.096846 |  near post Rhys tries to flick it it's blocked by the man behind him and then it's sort of
[2288.00 - 2293.04] P:1598.80 E:0.101553 |  hiked back in by Bellingham but it was a bouncing effort and it just bounced through harmlessly
[2293.04 - 2299.28] P:1399.72 E:0.111836 |  to Donna Rummer and Italy looked to play it away quickly oh and that's Harry Maguire putting in the
[2299.28 - 2304.56] P:1460.03 E:0.097295 |  challenge on Barela but he got the ball committed himself got the ball and put it out only just
[2304.56 - 2309.68] P:1312.51 E:0.093280 |  I mean Barela came from the wrong side of him didn't he Harry Maguire already kind of launched
[2309.68 - 2316.08] P:1354.82 E:0.094352 |  himself into the sliding challenge and just got there before Barela literally at the same time
[2317.52 - 2322.96] P:1264.27 E:0.106560 |  as uh England now could open up here for Sterling four to the centre circle Sterling
[2322.96 - 2327.76] P:1466.22 E:0.104153 |  absolutely rattles it onto the chest of Kane who did well to control that but then the attempted
[2327.84 - 2334.56] P:1553.98 E:0.108380 |  past James was cut out by DiMarco and Italy now come forward with purpose Scammercat back to Barela
[2335.20 - 2340.56] P:1281.86 E:0.098884 |  Rhys is with him though so just checks his progress and then Christante receives it from him in
[2340.56 - 2346.40] P:1276.21 E:0.098351 |  England a very quickly back in position behind the ball nil nil the score five life from the BBC
[2346.40 - 2351.20] P:1298.53 E:0.104901 |  on a Friday night five life sport tomorrow the headline act tomorrow commentary on the grand
[2351.20 - 2356.72] P:1261.41 E:0.098926 |  final the St. Helens Leeds grand final from six o'clock but we also have commentary tomorrow
[2356.72 - 2361.36] P:1334.07 E:0.105237 |  on the Arsenal Topham game in the women's super league as the balls played over the top for Italy
[2361.36 - 2366.16] P:1339.58 E:0.102999 |  and it comes back to the edge of the box the initial intention was Scammercat there but it
[2366.16 - 2370.40] P:1365.35 E:0.097396 |  came back to Christante on the edge of the area he tried it an effort but that was blocked on the
[2370.40 - 2374.48] P:1492.47 E:0.106468 |  edge of the area and England were able to clear it to the halfway line Italy take up possession
[2374.48 - 2379.76] P:1391.58 E:0.101569 |  again though here is Giorgio and he gets it back in the centre circle turns the full 360 degrees
[2379.76 - 2385.68] P:1288.27 E:0.098958 |  and actually a little bit more than that and then now finds a chairby and the central defenders
[2385.68 - 2391.76] P:1254.22 E:0.090752 |  left footed crosses headed down and away by Dyer and then Nick Puld is able to clear it after
[2391.76 - 2399.76] P:1121.53 E:0.099583 |  it was tapped back to him by Rhys James still nil nil but Declan Rice putting in the challenge
[2400.56 - 2409.12] P:1663.15 E:0.099047 |  centre field Italy on the move again with Christante forward to Raspidori and then Christante finds
[2409.68 - 2416.56] P:1347.49 E:0.091249 |  Kyle Walker arriving so Italy go back to Toloi again now here is Giorgio Giorgio
[2416.56 - 2422.00] P:1117.89 E:0.095646 |  squared at Christante Rice puts in the challenge and that means that England have been able to
[2422.00 - 2426.16] P:1289.03 E:0.105544 |  get it back and clear the halfway line but Italy take possession again and England just on the
[2426.16 - 2429.92] P:1459.69 E:0.089343 |  back foot at the moment Matt Upton. Scammercat can't get hold of the ball I mean it's been
[2430.80 - 2434.96] P:1504.90 E:0.103674 |  what we've touched on the pass it hasn't been up to the level for me in this game from England
[2434.96 - 2440.24] P:1798.38 E:0.107780 |  has been too many misplaced passes not enough assurance when they're moving the ball and Italy
[2440.80 - 2444.64] P:1829.81 E:0.113490 |  just keep winning the ball back and then getting back in possession having their spells
[2445.92 - 2450.88] P:1832.07 E:0.110467 |  it's really like you say they've been played very much in the central area of the pitch and not a
[2450.88 - 2458.32] P:1666.41 E:0.095056 |  lot of penalty box action in this game. No there's no and it was an issue lack of goals
[2459.12 - 2463.28] P:1309.98 E:0.097971 |  put it very simply in those matches in the Nations League in June just the one penalty
[2463.36 - 2471.68] P:1216.88 E:0.101773 |  in Munich from Harry Kane and created so little when you consider that they scored the 39 goals
[2471.68 - 2476.48] P:1229.69 E:0.098372 |  in the group which was a record in a qualifying group for England but against the better opposition
[2476.48 - 2482.24] P:1261.31 E:0.094358 |  that's the concern England have struggled in the Nations League to create chances Italy coming
[2482.24 - 2487.36] P:1227.42 E:0.098125 |  forward trying to create chances of their own but it's cleared away by Dyer and then folding his
[2488.32 - 2493.84] P:1772.38 E:0.105868 |  box and it's a free kick to England. The photo just using his body well gets between
[2494.64 - 2499.04] P:1632.16 E:0.103601 |  the ball and a chair beat I think it is he's gone all the way up the pitch from the left side
[2499.04 - 2508.24] P:1425.10 E:0.092302 |  centre back position to win the win the foul but England just not really gelling in terms of movement
[2508.24 - 2515.20] P:1534.41 E:0.093895 |  and passing it has to be said it's just that that's the key for me in this game any piece of
[2515.20 - 2518.88] P:1474.05 E:0.096362 |  quality when they have got three or four passes off they've created something there's been a bit
[2518.88 - 2523.20] P:1611.71 E:0.097657 |  of space there's then been a runner they're not short in in running energy are there when you look
[2523.20 - 2529.92] P:1766.39 E:0.094295 |  up likes of Walker James Bellingham Sacker all in kind of midfield or defensive roles there's so
[2529.92 - 2534.40] P:1568.40 E:0.102132 |  much energy in this team if they just get the passing going on they can really create something
[2535.12 - 2540.24] P:1597.57 E:0.102668 |  they have to use the old phrase cancelled each other out Sterling to Kane just forward of the
[2540.24 - 2544.88] P:1538.52 E:0.101739 |  centre circle Foulden gives it back to Kane now here's James on the right-hand side James
[2545.20 - 2550.40] P:1539.97 E:0.101170 |  into the box now puts his foot on the ball drags it back still going Reese James he's got Kyle Walker
[2550.40 - 2556.24] P:1592.50 E:0.102026 |  behind him Walker takes a touch and then plays the ball through tried to thread it through the gap
[2556.24 - 2562.00] P:1694.59 E:0.102925 |  for James to run on to the walkers pass was overhead and it's a goal kick and it comes to nothing
[2562.56 - 2566.88] P:1574.51 E:0.106373 |  and I think Reese James ever really wanted that pass in there Walker wanted to play that ball
[2566.88 - 2570.16] P:1623.96 E:0.102410 |  it was the most aggressive pass that straight ball in behind the fallback
[2571.12 - 2575.52] P:1544.67 E:0.100295 |  but Reese James never really committed to that run and it was always going to run out of play
[2577.28 - 2587.76] P:1491.96 E:0.103932 |  so it remains Italy Nail England Nail official figure incidentally is 4451 England fans are here
[2588.40 - 2595.68] P:1569.52 E:0.104450 |  and they've brought probably over a hundred England flags across the St George up there in the in the
[2595.68 - 2600.80] P:1528.19 E:0.106699 |  gobs Italy coming for it Tristan he plays it across but it's behind Scamaca Toloi now joins
[2600.80 - 2604.80] P:1282.25 E:0.113939 |  the attack but Sterling went with him and England have been able to win the ball back from Italian
[2604.80 - 2610.48] P:1470.05 E:0.105963 |  from Toloi and Saka gives it to Harry Kane and Harry Kane runs from the centre circle and Kane
[2610.48 - 2616.00] P:1687.22 E:0.105764 |  shoots but it whizzes away over the top of the crossbar by four or five yards well for one of the
[2616.00 - 2620.72] P:1853.44 E:0.111236 |  first times in this game the Italians really did commit themselves forward and leave himself a
[2620.88 - 2626.16] P:1689.65 E:0.090725 |  bit open at the back Harry Kane is just traveling with the ball and I think he thought
[2626.16 - 2630.56] P:1393.20 E:0.095421 |  they're just going to keep backing off I'm going to hit one but it's always harder for me to hit
[2630.56 - 2635.92] P:1383.41 E:0.094702 |  the ball to get that clean strike when the ball's rolling away from you at pace and he was always
[2635.92 - 2642.72] P:1444.31 E:0.092811 |  stretching for the strike and the ball was always rising so it is still Nail Nail
[2643.20 - 2645.20] P:1662.35 E:0.112220 |  Nail
[2646.88 - 2652.32] P:1546.80 E:0.099721 |  goes down and that's a free kick to England half inside the Italian half yes Harry Kane doesn't
[2652.32 - 2656.16] P:1308.83 E:0.100952 |  score too many goals from outside of the penalty area for England I remember the one in Warsaw
[2656.16 - 2663.36] P:1501.58 E:0.081022 |  that was a cracking goal the late goal in Warsaw a couple of years ago but it's a free kick now
[2663.36 - 2666.72] P:1462.33 E:0.094489 |  England have already had one from this sort of position Folden's going to take this from the
[2666.72 - 2672.00] P:1478.04 E:0.097053 |  left hand side so again Italy are holding their line three or four yards outside of the penalty
[2672.00 - 2679.20] P:1823.14 E:0.095867 |  area down to our right Folden waiting over there one foot slightly in front of the other
[2679.92 - 2684.48] P:1667.64 E:0.111314 |  up goes the right arm here's the delivery from Folden looking for rice but I think Benucci
[2684.48 - 2690.08] P:1464.26 E:0.099584 |  got his head to it first and the ball bounces out of play and the referee says is he giving a free
[2690.08 - 2695.44] P:1567.82 E:0.093741 |  kick Eric Dyer has run towards the referee on his way back to the halfway line or did he just
[2695.44 - 2699.52] P:1412.84 E:0.094113 |  give the goal I think it's for a shove sure if you had his in the back I think it's a free kick
[2699.52 - 2706.32] P:1547.49 E:0.089968 |  for a shove but good delivery into the box the Italians defended it well Benucci Declan rice
[2706.32 - 2713.12] P:1664.93 E:0.088281 |  was kind of between Benucci and and Tolloi Benucci just won that ball but it's for a shove
[2714.16 - 2721.20] P:1561.00 E:0.091113 |  on the edge of the box I think so it's still nil nil the official attendance has come through
[2721.20 - 2728.88] P:1511.19 E:0.091317 |  which is 50,640 which is swelled by as I say almost four and a half thousand England fans
[2729.76 - 2736.48] P:1463.52 E:0.098568 |  but that means that it's sort of getting towards two-thirds full the San Siro so we can see lots
[2736.48 - 2743.04] P:1307.71 E:0.095540 |  of the coloured seats empty around the place as England with Walker played out to James but
[2743.04 - 2748.40] P:1369.43 E:0.104648 |  DeMarco is able to get the challenge in and then Walker DeMarco is there with him DeMarco saying
[2748.40 - 2754.08] P:1481.91 E:0.096458 |  the final touch was off Walker which took it behind but referee Manzano says no goal kick
[2754.08 - 2758.96] P:1342.15 E:0.097450 |  England's it's been a little bit uncertain this right hand side isn't it Walker and James have not
[2758.96 - 2766.32] P:1359.46 E:0.086876 |  really been on the same wavelength with the ball it's hard to kind of see where that that's heading
[2766.32 - 2770.56] P:1355.45 E:0.096580 |  at the moment I mean James is pulling quite wide but they're a little bit on top of each other and
[2770.56 - 2774.88] P:1185.73 E:0.101366 |  whether or not there's not quite the same support because on the other side Sack has come and really
[2774.88 - 2780.48] P:1149.30 E:0.106592 |  narrowed into that position more so and James is staying wide on this side Foden's a little bit
[2780.48 - 2784.96] P:1279.81 E:0.099122 |  higher than him they're just a little bit on that same line up and down this right hand side and need
[2784.96 - 2789.68] P:1374.15 E:0.102179 |  to come off the angle a little bit to create some space the crowd getting onto Nick Paul because he
[2789.68 - 2796.72] P:1372.53 E:0.093149 |  takes that goal kick and Benucci back headed to the goalkeeper at the other end nil nil so England
[2796.72 - 2804.40] P:1482.51 E:0.095869 |  in November those three group matches against Iran USA and then Wales so that is the 21st of
[2804.40 - 2810.40] P:1499.17 E:0.105566 |  November the 25th of November and the 29th of November and there is the halftime whistle here
[2810.40 - 2816.80] P:1428.38 E:0.100757 |  in September and it's nil nil at halftime and I think it deserves to be that upset yeah not quite
[2816.80 - 2821.20] P:1499.77 E:0.100823 |  the game I was picturing all member saying to you when I saw the team lines up I'm looking forward
[2821.20 - 2827.28] P:1485.31 E:0.090681 |  to this game this could be one of those real high quality matches but it hasn't been that and I think
[2827.28 - 2832.96] P:1313.53 E:0.099523 |  both teams you can't lack the willingness and and almost like that the endeavor that they're showing
[2832.96 - 2837.36] P:1340.88 E:0.094105 |  to want to be sharp to want to be on the front foot but that just hasn't been matched by the
[2837.36 - 2841.84] P:1240.34 E:0.098583 |  quality with the ball whether it's nerves whether it's a little bit of lack of confidence in the
[2841.84 - 2848.32] P:1357.07 E:0.096517 |  system or with each other who knows but it's not quite delivering what it should do at this stage
[2848.32 - 2854.96] P:1238.12 E:0.096696 |  at halftime no it is not and I think really it can only improve first half of very few chances
[2854.96 - 2861.36] P:1171.73 E:0.099506 |  and here in Milan at the break it is Italy nil England nil I think the excitement peaked
[2861.36 - 2866.08] P:1262.41 E:0.109572 |  pre-kickoff with the soprano singers isn't it John it all kind of went a bit downhill from there
[2867.28 - 2874.24] P:1554.61 E:0.093054 |  Carly was a real star yes I assume I should bring her on for the second half yeah and I
[2874.24 - 2879.52] P:1400.74 E:0.098214 |  there's got to be something in that just in the Garisouth gate does or says at halftime because
[2879.52 - 2884.96] P:1514.12 E:0.095858 |  Matt you said specifically about the passing in this England side and whether it was potentially
[2884.96 - 2889.20] P:1429.77 E:0.103756 |  an issue with confidence or nerves but that's a bit of a worry isn't it two months out for a
[2889.20 - 2893.04] P:1340.06 E:0.093835 |  well cut well I just think it's yeah that the quality hasn't been in the game I think it's
[2893.04 - 2899.04] P:1628.09 E:0.088945 |  been both sides to be honest but but England certainly haven't got hold of the ball and
[2899.04 - 2903.68] P:1743.31 E:0.095217 |  passed with the quality that we know they have I think Eric Dyer has has made a difference in
[2903.68 - 2908.72] P:1691.46 E:0.091709 |  that central road is but is very composed as comfortable with the ball and I think he's passed
[2908.72 - 2914.40] P:1596.40 E:0.096194 |  it pretty well but in terms of receiving skills in the midfield areas and higher up the pitch in
[2914.48 - 2919.84] P:1606.42 E:0.094489 |  terms of sacca and sterling it hasn't quite been at that level that you'd want because there's such
[2919.84 - 2924.16] P:1338.65 E:0.088634 |  impact players and they play so quickly when they're in sync and the touch is good and they'll
[2924.16 - 2929.12] P:1439.77 E:0.090750 |  play quickly round the corner one touch two touch and it's great to watch so you know it hasn't quite
[2929.12 - 2934.40] P:1517.79 E:0.087581 |  been there yet Matt John we'll be back with you with the second half shortly before we go to the
[2934.40 - 2938.80] P:1484.43 E:0.097607 |  news though let's bring in Everton winger Andros Townsend Andros would you make that 45?
[2938.80 - 2946.16] P:1501.30 E:0.092881 |  I think the boys covered most of it I think focusing on the positive really like the back
[2946.16 - 2951.76] P:1561.64 E:0.094270 |  three especially Eric Dyer that the way Matt touched on really composed really calm as a real
[2951.76 - 2956.80] P:1448.10 E:0.093245 |  figure communicating well with the two next to him he's the one who's looking to break lines forward
[2956.80 - 2965.84] P:1352.90 E:0.082414 |  always looking to get England's attack started and Declan Rice as well covering Akiah Sacher when
[2965.84 - 2972.00] P:1447.30 E:0.094071 |  he goes forward Sacher finds more natural midfield position as opposed to a wing back so there are
[2972.00 - 2976.80] P:1372.74 E:0.077618 |  positives obviously that watching that burst off there are a lot of things to work on as well I'm

[3221.84 - 3226.40] P:1728.00 E:0.082314 |  It's really hard for me to make a judgment and accurate judgment on that because I like I don't
[3226.40 - 3231.92] P:1633.88 E:0.065101 |  know what was happening previous and you know I believe there was a lot of good things happening
[3232.16 - 3237.04] P:1697.46 E:0.070258 |  and there was a good roster and a good bunch of people but for whatever reason it just hadn't
[3237.60 - 3243.68] P:1628.19 E:0.071607 |  clicked and so I came in with you know open eyes and ready to be adaptable and listen and you
[3243.68 - 3248.72] P:1761.94 E:0.081197 |  know make some changes in some areas that I thought you know just suited me and my style
[3248.72 - 3253.52] P:1654.91 E:0.070634 |  but also that would suit our players as well. With the way that we played and also just the
[3253.52 - 3258.00] P:1652.06 E:0.080542 |  way things were around the environment so it's hard to say what's you know different to earlier
[3258.00 - 3262.08] P:1820.34 E:0.076069 |  in the year I've just guess I've tried to be myself and tried to be adaptable to the group
[3262.08 - 3265.68] P:1356.83 E:0.071834 |  I'm working with. And there's obviously a Smith thing going on here because I mean your uncle
[3266.40 - 3271.76] P:1513.94 E:0.073530 |  two leads to their first grand final win in something like 30 odd years and that was you know
[3271.76 - 3276.32] P:1545.43 E:0.090233 |  a revelation and what you've done here is a revelation. Have you spoken much to Uncle Tony this week?
[3277.20 - 3281.76] P:1709.93 E:0.080080 |  Not this week we've had a couple of messages and he sort of reminded me about enjoying the week and
[3282.32 - 3286.48] P:1749.16 E:0.076236 |  obviously he's been here and done that a lot so to have that reminder was a good one to
[3286.96 - 3291.84] P:1791.10 E:0.061738 |  to make sure you know enjoy it rather than you know stress too much about the yet potential
[3291.84 - 3296.24] P:1893.86 E:0.067590 |  outcome and just just enjoy the week and as we have done for the last few months it's been an
[3296.24 - 3300.32] P:1421.38 E:0.083687 |  enjoyable place to be and we've built a bit of momentum and there's a good vibe around and a
[3300.32 - 3306.48] P:1788.71 E:0.047894 |  belief in the group so it's good to have Tony there to have a chat too but yeah I think I just
[3306.48 - 3311.52] P:1865.28 E:0.074094 |  got to try and be myself that's the main thing. That was leads Rhinos head coach Ron Smith chatting
[3311.52 - 3316.24] P:1844.23 E:0.086271 |  to Dave Woods there. His counterpart tomorrow Christian Wolth takes charge of St Helens for
[3316.24 - 3321.52] P:1771.57 E:0.084203 |  the final time. It'll mark the end of a three-year stay that has seen his side win three successive
[3321.52 - 3327.76] P:1652.31 E:0.076489 |  super league grand finals now on the verge of an unprecedented fourth so will this one mean the most?
[3327.76 - 3332.80] P:1716.09 E:0.085061 |  They're all special they all come with challenges you know I think about how I felt after the 2021
[3332.80 - 3336.72] P:1669.33 E:0.085514 |  I would have said that was the most special at that time I'm pretty sure and probably would have
[3336.72 - 3340.96] P:1692.26 E:0.087892 |  done the same last year and I've got no doubt I feel that way if we can get to that sort of result
[3340.96 - 3346.40] P:1817.60 E:0.079229 |  this weekend but I think we have had to overcome more challenges this year in different ways and
[3347.12 - 3351.92] P:1730.61 E:0.086169 |  we've had different challenges in 2020 and 2021 but there are more around off-field stuff whereas
[3352.48 - 3356.64] P:1872.59 E:0.077722 |  challenges this year have come on-field and you know not just the number of injuries or the
[3356.64 - 3361.76] P:1816.00 E:0.074497 |  number of suspensions the amount of chop and change but who those players have been as well and
[3361.76 - 3365.36] P:1741.46 E:0.071612 |  there've been some of the best players in the competition in their position and you know the
[3365.36 - 3370.08] P:1753.57 E:0.084761 |  guys we play without this week you know Al Worms, Lewis Dodd, Regan Grace, they're three players
[3370.08 - 3373.68] P:1469.22 E:0.089155 |  that will play in any team and you know make a big influence in any team and certainly make a big
[3373.68 - 3378.80] P:1788.02 E:0.074182 |  influence in a grand final and with Al Worms you've got a case there to say that he's one of the best
[3378.80 - 3383.28] P:1768.26 E:0.076771 |  in his position in the world not just in this competition as well so I think we have had to
[3383.28 - 3387.28] P:1805.76 E:0.074505 |  overcome you know some big obstacles this year and I've been really proud of how the group's
[3387.28 - 3391.52] P:1804.50 E:0.067474 |  gone about that and you know what makes them such a special group is the way they want to compete,
[3391.52 - 3396.00] P:1721.07 E:0.073578 |  the way they want to fight, the way they want to overcome adversity and that's what this year's been
[3396.00 - 3401.28] P:1803.81 E:0.068890 |  about and for those reasons the fact that we're here I'm extremely proud of the group and if we
[3401.28 - 3407.28] P:1698.75 E:0.074108 |  could go ahead and win it I think I would be more proud than other years and you know the other thing
[3407.28 - 3411.92] P:1615.88 E:0.070579 |  that I've got to add to that is it becomes a little bit harder every year to have that same fight,
[3411.92 - 3416.72] P:1681.62 E:0.076577 |  have that same hunger, the opposition get better and to get to where we are there's been a challenge
[3416.72 - 3421.12] P:1674.22 E:0.080570 |  in those ways as well and I'd be extremely proud that's for sure if we can go and lift the trophy
[3421.12 - 3428.72] P:1745.28 E:0.078365 |  at the end of it. And it's day one of the Lever Cup at the O2 Arena in London our tennis correspondent
[3428.72 - 3433.76] P:1759.55 E:0.081916 |  Russell Fuller is with us and Andy Murray is in action Russ but the main attraction still to come.
[3435.52 - 3440.40] P:1857.35 E:0.089908 |  Yes Roger Federer and Raphael Nadal teaming up to play doubles in what will be Federer's final
[3440.40 - 3446.16] P:1879.83 E:0.085973 |  match as a professional to come after Andy Murray against Alex Diminor and Murray for team Europe
[3446.16 - 3451.92] P:1788.07 E:0.079005 |  against Diminor for Team World has just taken the first set which lasted 81 minutes by seven games
[3451.92 - 3456.80] P:1795.66 E:0.072439 |  to five he's playing some wonderfully creative shots against the man who is the higher ranked player
[3456.80 - 3462.24] P:1820.48 E:0.070283 |  Alex Diminor just outside the world's top 20. The Lever Cup feed is currently providing pictures of
[3462.24 - 3467.44] P:1743.41 E:0.081312 |  that match and also they have a camera on the various team rooms and if you look at the European
[3467.44 - 3472.08] P:1758.79 E:0.072445 |  team room at least a few minutes ago you could have seen Raphael Nadal and Roger Federer sitting
[3472.08 - 3476.48] P:1684.66 E:0.075704 |  around the dining room table chatting in Federer by the looks of things enjoying a bowl of fruit
[3476.48 - 3484.88] P:1728.03 E:0.070732 |  salad. Wow what a group of players at the O2 Arena in London tonight it won't be much longer we can
[3484.88 - 3489.20] P:1580.94 E:0.083547 |  talk about all those names in the same sense it's certainly not competing against each other
[3489.20 - 3495.76] P:1642.70 E:0.083087 |  anyway so that's all the action and the latest from the Lever Cup at London's O2 Arena.
[3496.48 - 3502.48] P:1581.35 E:0.086569 |  Our focus though certainly until 10 o'clock this evening here on Five Live Sport is on the football
[3502.48 - 3508.32] P:1576.67 E:0.077942 |  England and Italy currently goalless in Milan at San Siro won't be long until we're back with our
[3508.32 - 3513.04] P:1542.13 E:0.084565 |  commentary team John Murray and Matt Upton but for the time bringing being let's bring back in
[3513.04 - 3521.12] P:1701.79 E:0.085146 |  Andros Townsend. Andros it does seem to be this lack of cohesion on the pitch doesn't there across
[3521.12 - 3525.44] P:1722.60 E:0.079053 |  the entire thing they're really struggling to stitch together certainly the attacking players
[3525.52 - 3530.08] P:1351.91 E:0.093283 |  they're likes to fold in they're really having to drop a bit deeper aren't they so what's the plan
[3530.08 - 3536.16] P:1400.90 E:0.078507 |  how do we get them more into the game? I think first and foremost that the two wingers folding
[3536.16 - 3541.76] P:1544.92 E:0.097304 |  sterling need to work better with Harry Kane if Harry Kane drops in like he likes to do we need runners
[3541.76 - 3547.12] P:1574.55 E:0.090949 |  in behind we need runners stretching the Italian back three so then Harry Kane can either drop off
[3547.12 - 3552.56] P:1622.74 E:0.085676 |  and get on the ball and get space and get turned or we can we can stretch them and get our our quick
[3552.56 - 3558.56] P:1417.00 E:0.089950 |  players in against their back three but I think our defensive third have done very well like I
[3558.56 - 3564.00] P:1491.37 E:0.087511 |  spoke about before the back three Declan Rice in particular in particular marshalling well that
[3564.00 - 3570.64] P:1657.68 E:0.084427 |  left hand side and Saka does get forward but needed just a bit more creativity a bit more freedom a
[3570.64 - 3575.52] P:1453.23 E:0.088411 |  bit more ideas not even in the final third but we're barely getting there in the middle third
[3575.68 - 3582.56] P:1556.94 E:0.077994 |  Do you sense nerves out there Matt said he seemed to sense it when he was watching on it in commentary
[3582.56 - 3586.08] P:1464.47 E:0.093600 |  but do you think that might be part of the problem when it comes to this lack of fluidity between
[3586.08 - 3592.72] P:1600.47 E:0.078463 |  the players so far? I wouldn't put it down to nerves I think maybe the first five ten minutes
[3592.72 - 3598.80] P:1499.73 E:0.083534 |  you saw a few rest decisions where normally players would have the confidence to bring the ball down
[3598.80 - 3604.32] P:1608.65 E:0.082499 |  from the sky and get playing but I think it's just been the lack of ideas I think it's always
[3604.40 - 3610.16] P:1581.25 E:0.081973 |  difficult to play against Italians they play a low block they do very well they're notoriously
[3610.16 - 3614.48] P:1477.33 E:0.086928 |  hard to break down but we're making it easier for them where we're standing up against them
[3614.48 - 3619.76] P:1474.24 E:0.085414 |  there's no runners off and there's no interchanging when they've got the ball at the back and Georginio's
[3619.76 - 3624.16] P:1460.22 E:0.090498 |  dropping off to get in it there's no real pressure on the ball and I don't think that's the problem
[3624.16 - 3629.20] P:1495.72 E:0.074285 |  with the front three it's because we're so deep defensively that the front three can't get up to
[3629.20 - 3633.28] P:1575.22 E:0.093075 |  the ball can't get any real pressure on the ball I think collectively as a team we need to get higher
[3633.36 - 3639.44] P:1558.08 E:0.081800 |  up the pitch to allow our front three to really start defending from the front like we see the
[3639.44 - 3645.92] P:1565.35 E:0.080814 |  players do from when they're playing for their clubs. Do you expect to see any changes in personnel
[3646.56 - 3653.20] P:1603.55 E:0.077145 |  coming out of the break? Initially no I think Gareth would trust his players that he has on
[3653.20 - 3659.60] P:1779.76 E:0.073576 |  the pitch to try and change it themselves try and find a way to fake them down but of course as soon
[3659.60 - 3664.48] P:1813.81 E:0.094846 |  as you start hitting 55-60 minutes the name that springs to me immediately is Jack Rielish
[3664.48 - 3669.44] P:1695.80 E:0.094141 |  he's the game changer can he get on can he he will get on the ball he will get on the ball in
[3669.44 - 3674.32] P:1564.62 E:0.087123 |  the middle third he will commit players and he hopefully he'll get closer to Harry Kane and get
[3674.32 - 3680.32] P:1599.13 E:0.087926 |  Harry Kane in the game. Well already there's lots for us to talk about and just Townsend's going to
[3680.32 - 3686.48] P:1473.89 E:0.091126 |  be back with us again after the game but a big second 45 coming up for England just to bring
[3686.56 - 3691.04] P:1437.21 E:0.085802 |  you up to speed with what else is going on in the nation's league this evening. The other teams
[3691.04 - 3700.00] P:1586.37 E:0.091012 |  in that group A3 Hungary still ahead 1-0 against Germany so Hungary still leading Germany by
[3700.00 - 3707.68] P:1514.32 E:0.093779 |  Goltenil in the other game still goalless though at San Siro the players have emerged for the second
[3707.68 - 3713.60] P:1541.21 E:0.090640 |  half so I'll hand you back to our commentary team out there in Milan this evening is John Murray
[3713.60 - 3719.92] P:1591.28 E:0.091999 |  alongside Matt Upsett. Thanks Emma yes welcome back to Milan just watching Gareth Southgate in
[3719.92 - 3725.36] P:1719.34 E:0.100619 |  that dark brown suit making his way under the perspex top of the dugout no changes from him at
[3725.36 - 3730.16] P:1627.32 E:0.101272 |  halftime it's the same England team they're out there already Italy are just emerging now so the
[3730.16 - 3737.44] P:1319.43 E:0.110684 |  England team Pope Walker Dyer and Maguire James Rice Bellingham and Saka and Foden and Sterling
[3737.44 - 3743.36] P:1354.43 E:0.098384 |  either side of Kane Matthew Upsett who do you want to see more from from England in the second
[3743.36 - 3748.96] P:1280.01 E:0.116016 |  half well I think we could see more from our wing bats certainly I don't think we've seen the best
[3748.96 - 3754.80] P:1530.08 E:0.109044 |  of Saka and Rice James in that first half but also I think Drew Bellingham as well can get
[3754.80 - 3759.44] P:1794.23 E:0.090244 |  forwards and make those runs I thought the point that Andros made was was bang on in that there's
[3759.44 - 3764.96] P:1603.09 E:0.092757 |  just not enough movement stretching the pitch asking questions of the Italian team who do defend
[3764.96 - 3769.92] P:1392.94 E:0.096402 |  very well there has to be more questions asked in this second half yeah Andros Townsend with this
[3769.92 - 3774.88] P:1555.39 E:0.097320 |  turn out we'll hear from him again at halftime he's watching from back in the UK but Matthew Upsett
[3774.88 - 3780.00] P:1239.76 E:0.107897 |  will play with Englanders here alongside me up in the second tier on the dressing room side
[3780.56 - 3786.16] P:1356.44 E:0.106991 |  Giuseppe Miata stadium Italy are out as well their run changed so as they started the match with
[3786.16 - 3791.44] P:1295.05 E:0.113149 |  Donoroma in goal Toloi, Bernucci and a Cherby the three central defenders Dilerenzo on the right
[3791.44 - 3797.52] P:1464.00 E:0.099234 |  DiMarco on the left then Giorgio with Barela and Cristante either side of him and Raspidori
[3797.52 - 3804.96] P:1357.14 E:0.096106 |  and Scamaca up front second half begins the score Italy nil England nil disappointing first half
[3805.60 - 3810.00] P:1393.38 E:0.105109 |  not many thrills and spilled at all and then Bernucci now at the start of the second half it's a
[3810.00 - 3815.44] P:1345.49 E:0.099238 |  pass that was right out of the first half playbook he hit it straight out of play England take the
[3815.44 - 3822.32] P:1407.28 E:0.099146 |  throw but Sterling is surrounded by Italian blue and so the home side have it back and now Brian
[3822.32 - 3829.12] P:1398.79 E:0.099233 |  Cristante of Roma Giorgio Zemrinho's Roma his ball for that's cleared away by England and Italy
[3829.12 - 3834.16] P:1285.62 E:0.102198 |  have it again with Giorgio inside his own heart and Bernucci just works it out towards the left
[3834.16 - 3840.24] P:1418.57 E:0.101525 |  hand side and then a Cherby a high pass over the top James was underneath that for England though
[3840.24 - 3845.04] P:1510.23 E:0.100199 |  a Cherby was trying to find DiMarco down the left hand side England in the new white shirts
[3846.40 - 3852.24] P:1507.50 E:0.098980 |  tried to find Sterling with the pass but that went astray and it's the same same old thing
[3852.24 - 3858.40] P:1315.81 E:0.092181 |  that we saw in the first half misplaced passes not a good start to the second half two or three
[3858.40 - 3865.68] P:1372.70 E:0.093605 |  things it just aren't quite at it Raheem Sterling doesn't look quite at it for me at the moment
[3865.68 - 3870.96] P:1376.59 E:0.095127 |  to be honest in terms of of having the ball and when he's bitten he's been smothered out he's got
[3870.96 - 3874.32] P:1454.69 E:0.097540 |  to try and offload it a little bit quicker there's two or three players around him there has to be
[3875.28 - 3879.92] P:1354.95 E:0.103531 |  he'll try and find a pass out it's just the Italian players are getting all around him and
[3879.92 - 3883.92] P:1417.38 E:0.108787 |  just smothering him out of the game Bellingham slides into the challenge and misses the ball
[3883.92 - 3888.08] P:1537.86 E:0.117684 |  and Italy move it out to the left DiMarco's ball into the middle cleared away by Dià
[3888.80 - 3893.76] P:1428.42 E:0.112963 |  and he had to get there because Cristante was arriving and he must have been millimeters away
[3893.76 - 3899.20] P:1566.58 E:0.102505 |  with that outstretched foot Cristante from getting a touch but Dià just cleared it well
[3899.20 - 3903.60] P:1539.29 E:0.113211 |  you're absolutely right he was so close to getting on the end of that Cristante but here is Sterling
[3903.60 - 3908.08] P:1501.45 E:0.112754 |  now breaking from inside his own half takes the ball under the edge of the area Benucci with
[3908.08 - 3913.76] P:1528.31 E:0.114139 |  the challenge he caught him Sterling went down and it's a yellow card for the Italian captain for
[3913.76 - 3918.56] P:1621.06 E:0.107430 |  that challenge on the edge of the box on Raheem Sterling but sent him flying down and actually
[3918.56 - 3923.84] P:1550.69 E:0.110948 |  fell into the penalty area but the free kick is just outside well Benucci really protesting strongly
[3923.84 - 3928.72] P:1419.17 E:0.111750 |  with the referee feels he got a piece of the ball and it ricocheted off Sterling but that's just so
[3928.72 - 3933.28] P:1451.52 E:0.115050 |  much better from Raheem Sterling it's not complicated it's just direct it's confident driving at a
[3933.28 - 3938.40] P:1404.40 E:0.112870 |  centre back in that position trying to go past him he's asking the question of Benucci here
[3939.04 - 3944.48] P:1313.16 E:0.106827 |  who for me doesn't get enough of the ball sticks a leg out to lunge into the tackle and Sterling
[3944.48 - 3950.56] P:1355.06 E:0.102445 |  goes over it and wins a free kick right on the edge of the 18-yard box yellow card for Benucci
[3950.56 - 3955.68] P:1500.71 E:0.102781 |  I'm not sure how much contact there was you know on Sterling maybe not maybe not but but he's lured
[3955.68 - 3963.12] P:1547.79 E:0.097352 |  the leg out from Benucci to put that across him and he's just gone over it he's lured
[3964.00 - 3971.84] P:1556.86 E:0.100995 |  he's lured the leg and then Sterling Sterling falling sharply there not for the first time today
[3972.88 - 3977.76] P:1704.15 E:0.115854 |  great position this isn't it James with the free kick we were talking about what he might be capable
[3977.76 - 3984.00] P:1823.74 E:0.117775 |  of they've got a man lying down behind the wall to form an Italian wall chance for Rhys James here
[3984.00 - 3990.56] P:1800.45 E:0.116078 |  from the free kick left of centre two yards outside the box James hits it up and over the wall
[3990.56 - 3996.88] P:1646.78 E:0.112035 |  and high over the bar and he's been mocked by those Italian fans in the lower tier behind the goal
[3996.88 - 4003.04] P:1526.67 E:0.101665 |  who almost I think they are actually doing mock laughter at him way over the top didn't threaten
[4003.04 - 4008.56] P:1546.83 E:0.097510 |  the goal well he's tried to strike it in that manner that you would see a player try and strike
[4008.56 - 4014.24] P:1703.38 E:0.094864 |  the ball if if it was a 10 15 yards further out you know that flat strike where you get that dip on
[4014.24 - 4018.48] P:1766.44 E:0.100879 |  the ball to bounce in front of the goalkeeper he's never going to get it up and down hitting it from
[4018.48 - 4023.52] P:1741.66 E:0.106065 |  that range it was only a yard outside the 18 yard box it needed you know much more finesse
[4024.64 - 4032.00] P:1692.17 E:0.106691 |  on that kind of free kick from that kind of range it's Lee Nell England Nell BBC Radio 5 Live
[4032.88 - 4039.36] P:1543.56 E:0.110314 |  it's a not a Friday night spectacular this by any means here's DeMarco down the left hand side
[4039.36 - 4044.88] P:1708.87 E:0.113586 |  James into the challenge they wanted a free kick the home supporters you can you can hear that but
[4044.96 - 4050.16] P:1596.72 E:0.105889 |  referee Manzano from Spain is unmoved and England have the ball inside the penalty area
[4050.16 - 4054.72] P:1598.01 E:0.110275 |  England in the second half playing from right to left as we look these new white shirts vivid white
[4054.72 - 4062.16] P:1557.52 E:0.104863 |  shirts with the two-tone blue areas on the shoulders dark blue shorts and Harry Kane winning the ball
[4062.16 - 4067.36] P:1523.68 E:0.112289 |  back from Toloy on the halfway line and Harry Kane now approaching the penalty area the angle is
[4067.36 - 4073.04] P:1579.68 E:0.112286 |  against him he shoots and it comes off Benucci and bounces away and behind and Benucci comes
[4073.04 - 4079.36] P:1607.25 E:0.102365 |  across and he cuddles Toloy and he um jeez up his fellow defenders there Cornette Winger
[4079.36 - 4084.96] P:1577.35 E:0.092350 |  well Benucci does well but I have to say I thought Harry Kane could have just flipped this ball
[4084.96 - 4090.40] P:1651.32 E:0.097322 |  across the box early Phil Foden really got on his bike at the back post throws his hands up in the
[4090.40 - 4095.84] P:1526.26 E:0.095400 |  air Foden almost saying he's just got to put the ball across the box and he's in for a strike on
[4095.84 - 4099.60] P:1560.06 E:0.097320 |  goal but he opts to shoot Harry Kane and Benucci just narrowed that angle.
[4099.76 - 4105.44] P:1295.65 E:0.097928 |  James has come across to take out that it's a red streak isn't it it's a sort of reddish pink
[4106.32 - 4109.36] P:1487.61 E:0.105520 |  ready sort of pinky so it's a couple of colors in here.
[4110.32 - 4115.28] P:1581.05 E:0.105176 |  Streak in his hair James with the corner for England towards the back post came as after it
[4115.28 - 4120.08] P:1611.23 E:0.107323 |  the Toloy stood up hard stood up strong and I think he might actually have headed the back of
[4120.08 - 4128.40] P:1722.50 E:0.110026 |  Toloy's head Harry Kane and he's ended up on his front flat on his face he is moving but he's got
[4128.40 - 4134.80] P:1493.13 E:0.102755 |  his hands up to his face and the referee is indicating that the medical people need to come
[4134.80 - 4140.00] P:1552.92 E:0.104593 |  on because he's taken a bash in the face. Yeah whether it's his nose or a part of his face I think
[4140.00 - 4147.12] P:1501.19 E:0.094232 |  as he tried to hit that ball Toloy was there and he just headed almost the side of his head
[4147.12 - 4155.76] P:1433.37 E:0.091054 |  with his face and Harry Kane still laying face down in the grass. Just being handed my pass to go

[4162.32 - 4166.72] P:1547.16 E:0.103191 |  for me to have something to ask questions about and he was just caught he was just caught on the
[4166.72 - 4171.04] P:1531.38 E:0.087933 |  side of the face we're seeing on the replayer I don't think there's any blood there but they'll
[4171.04 - 4176.96] P:1587.39 E:0.099388 |  have to go through the usual check so Italy nil England nil match a few chances it's good opportunity
[4176.96 - 4181.68] P:1351.40 E:0.098611 |  good position that for the James free kick but he just didn't just skyed it really over the crossbar.
[4181.68 - 4187.68] P:1547.56 E:0.089243 |  Just smashed it so hard and you've got a wall in front of you with with a player laying on the
[4187.68 - 4193.04] P:1535.74 E:0.093053 |  floor it needed to be placed somewhere do you know what I mean to get it up and down or to hit it
[4193.04 - 4196.56] P:1570.89 E:0.096820 |  that hard you've even got hit it and the wall breaking you might get a shot on target but it's
[4196.56 - 4200.72] P:1411.37 E:0.095449 |  always going to go over the bar. If you don't hear the interviews tonight and you can't wait

[4244.24 - 4251.84] P:1567.62 E:0.090261 |  Benetton 10. No action being missed because Kane is still being looked at. He's got a bang to the
[4251.84 - 4256.96] P:1660.94 E:0.092060 |  mouth he's got a bit of a bloodied mouth Harry Kane I think that was the part of his face that
[4256.96 - 4264.88] P:1703.70 E:0.095638 |  struck the side of Toloi's head. Tammy Abraham's warming up down here. Matt but I think Harry
[4264.88 - 4269.20] P:1782.35 E:0.099431 |  Kane is going to come back under the field. Yeah it'd be okay he's just kind of wiped himself down
[4269.20 - 4273.84] P:1675.04 E:0.082490 |  and got on with it but you're right the physio had to check everything. Steve Holland
[4274.72 - 4280.24] P:1561.39 E:0.095067 |  he's got a south gate assistant in his tracksuit he's just come out of the technical area as well
[4280.24 - 4284.08] P:1635.32 E:0.097234 |  just to check and see that Kane is okay he's reached the halfway line and he will be able to come
[4284.08 - 4291.04] P:1596.60 E:0.085832 |  back on. He can currently play with just the 10 men with Kane off the field Italy nil nil Italy
[4291.04 - 4296.72] P:1619.97 E:0.093326 |  with Toloi. Toloi gives it back to Giorgio and the Chelsea manager shuffles forward and then checks
[4296.72 - 4300.64] P:1548.01 E:0.104291 |  back and plays it back to Toloi behind him England have got everyone back behind the ball with Kane
[4300.64 - 4307.12] P:1608.12 E:0.101807 |  off the field and the fourth official I think is not letting Kane back on as Italy play the ball
[4307.12 - 4312.24] P:1497.27 E:0.101085 |  over the top for an easy catch for Pope who comes out of his six yard box and I think the fourth
[4312.24 - 4317.76] P:1507.37 E:0.096210 |  official is saying that there's still blood on his face therefore he can't come back on to the field
[4317.76 - 4323.52] P:1410.24 E:0.093165 |  well he's just been handed loads of different pieces of tissue basically just to keep wiping
[4323.52 - 4328.48] P:1409.23 E:0.098061 |  the blood away I think he's got a cut inside his mouth and obviously it's continuously bleeding
[4330.08 - 4333.44] P:1331.57 E:0.111131 |  so he's still not on the field England are still playing with 10 men but Bellingham now that's
[4333.44 - 4337.84] P:1512.45 E:0.105982 |  strong from him shrugs off Giorgio Bellingham takes it towards the edge of the box gives it to
[4337.84 - 4343.60] P:1401.83 E:0.095461 |  Foden Foden though has three Italians around him gives it back to James square from him to Rice but
[4343.60 - 4349.84] P:1280.30 E:0.098701 |  Rice passes behind Saka the England left wing back tonight the Arsenal man and now Harry Maguire
[4350.48 - 4359.20] P:1572.14 E:0.090575 |  back to Walker and still Kane is not allowed to come back onto the field Foden back to Rice England
[4359.20 - 4365.60] P:1532.92 E:0.111198 |  with it on the far side still Kane is being handed tissues he's got tissues in both hands
[4365.60 - 4371.84] P:1784.84 E:0.112629 |  the fourth official is saying he still can't come back onto the field well I mean there's going to
[4371.84 - 4376.48] P:1671.86 E:0.112993 |  come a point where they're going to say well can he can he come back into play I mean he's been
[4376.48 - 4382.24] P:1543.77 E:0.092405 |  stood there now for quite some time Nick Pulp has hit the ball straight out of play on the halfway
[4382.24 - 4388.64] P:1289.57 E:0.093613 |  line and the referee's raced across now just to give Kane the knot well that was a bit didn't make
[4388.64 - 4393.52] P:1489.22 E:0.087046 |  sense because the referee came over had one look and went what you did come on come on yeah he was
[4393.52 - 4399.36] P:1541.21 E:0.103075 |  already four or five yards on yeah Italy nil England nil oh that's a nice touch from Scamica
[4399.36 - 4403.68] P:1594.19 E:0.110322 |  Harry Maguire comes towards him Scamica turns gives it to the edge of the penalty area it might
[4403.68 - 4409.04] P:1623.48 E:0.103672 |  break for Raspidore but he ran into white England shirts and England clear through Maguire who just
[4409.04 - 4414.08] P:1527.63 E:0.098142 |  puts his left foot through the ball and waxes at a way downfield still nil nil 10 minutes played
[4414.08 - 4422.96] P:1435.28 E:0.095796 |  of the second half and the longer this match goes on the chances increase of a fifth consecutive draw
[4422.96 - 4430.80] P:1475.60 E:0.090790 |  in internationals between Italy and England four draws in a row of course one of them ended up in a
[4430.80 - 4438.08] P:1565.53 E:0.089771 |  penalty shootout victory for Italy at Wendley last year but they are they're very well matched
[4438.08 - 4445.60] P:1437.64 E:0.093217 |  there's really not much between them on the field tonight and it is Italy with Benucci the 35 year
[4445.60 - 4451.76] P:1597.03 E:0.111455 |  old Benucci still going strong craggy as ever ball played from him over the top of Raspidore
[4451.76 - 4457.68] P:1599.57 E:0.115572 |  who puts in DeMarco who plays it across and the offside flag was up actually against Borella who
[4457.68 - 4461.84] P:1516.55 E:0.102432 |  in any case couldn't slide it into the net full stretch on the edge of the six yard box
[4461.84 - 4467.52] P:1649.52 E:0.102345 |  he slid it wide yeah I mean I'm not sure if it was Borella all the the pass before that to DeMarco
[4468.24 - 4476.16] P:1608.06 E:0.096611 |  that was just delayed I think Borella had won it extra touch and then slid the ball wide to DeMarco
[4476.40 - 4483.12] P:1588.03 E:0.095010 |  yeah I think it's the first one from from DeMarco who's trying to hold his run he puts the ball
[4483.12 - 4489.20] P:1411.69 E:0.092748 |  across I mean it is a bad miss I think he was quite quite delighted to see the flag go up if I'm
[4489.20 - 4493.76] P:1553.88 E:0.102140 |  honest he's got to hit the target there. Borella yeah Italy nil England nil remains the score
[4493.76 - 4498.80] P:1633.60 E:0.105997 |  bounce back for Italy against Scamica Scamica who is very good actually as involvement in that last
[4498.80 - 4504.96] P:1669.63 E:0.117290 |  Italy move and then he's basically hauled over by Bellingham oh and now to England
[4504.96 - 4508.24] P:1782.96 E:0.113654 |  he's getting it in the end as well he's getting a foul to England doesn't he
[4508.24 - 4514.16] P:1820.03 E:0.107434 |  can you explain that to me well the only thing I can think of is whether or not Bellingham got his
[4514.16 - 4521.28] P:1602.74 E:0.107684 |  his body across for the ball and then obviously the tangle the referee's
[4521.28 - 4526.56] P:1460.09 E:0.111936 |  interpreted it was was was the fault of Scamica that's a strange one it is I mean I can understand
[4526.56 - 4530.48] P:1548.46 E:0.106295 |  Italy's frustration but yeah they're not giving the ball back to England and Phil Foghren was trying
[4530.48 - 4536.16] P:1371.39 E:0.102756 |  to get it back and he was pushed away shoved away and then DeMarco sat down on the far side
[4536.80 - 4546.24] P:1282.22 E:0.109481 |  so disjointed yeah it's a really poor game actually yeah neither team has has been fluid at all John
[4546.24 - 4553.20] P:1332.16 E:0.101931 |  have they in terms of I can't really say what England's game plan is in possession here what
[4553.20 - 4557.68] P:1492.83 E:0.099434 |  we're trying to what we're trying to achieve and nor Italy either like you said it has to be said
[4557.68 - 4562.80] P:1520.18 E:0.091854 |  both teams are looking a little bit out of sorts I think that are going to have a lot to do against
[4562.80 - 4568.16] P:1652.17 E:0.104159 |  Germany on Monday night to to convince in their last match before the World Cup at this rate
[4568.80 - 4576.08] P:1578.21 E:0.104374 |  but we've still got half an hour and more to play and Bucaio Saca concedes a throw in on the halfway
[4576.08 - 4580.16] P:1551.89 E:0.093845 |  line just bounced back into him and out of play so to throw in I think Italy are going to make the
[4580.16 - 4588.08] P:1339.71 E:0.085308 |  first change Roberto Mancini is I see with his assistant with that distinctive mustache the two
[4588.08 - 4592.00] P:1349.84 E:0.105066 |  of them in discussions they've got the files out but England have won it back on the halfway line
[4592.00 - 4596.64] P:1498.74 E:0.104869 |  Sterling plays it forward Bellingham now runs away from Giorgio Bellingham gives it to Foden on the
[4596.64 - 4601.76] P:1671.23 E:0.100962 |  left Foden chips it across Keynes arriving but a chair he got there first with his head
[4603.12 - 4608.40] P:1727.53 E:0.093648 |  but the offside flag is up against Foden I think and it's a free kick to Italy no no
[4608.40 - 4614.00] P:1726.94 E:0.086055 |  yeah it shouldn't be offside there Phil Foden I mean Italy's line must have been really good
[4614.00 - 4619.52] P:1631.15 E:0.092343 |  Bellingham the ball ricocheted off off Harry Kane and Bellingham was driving at the back four but
[4620.64 - 4627.12] P:1399.21 E:0.097059 |  I think it was Tonali Toloy who just stepped up didn't he caught Foden offside by half a yard
[4628.08 - 4635.04] P:1450.21 E:0.092662 |  Italy nail England 0 almost 15 minutes played in the second half so half an hour to go Italy
[4635.04 - 4640.80] P:1663.70 E:0.097707 |  take the short goal kick out Dona Roma gets it back and then Dona Roma right goes along
[4641.36 - 4648.08] P:1759.63 E:0.095415 |  but straight to James and James actually will give it back to Eric Dyer so England substitutes
[4648.80 - 4653.44] P:1606.34 E:0.100306 |  they're out warming up Grealish is down there Matt looks sure as well I can see Ward Prouse
[4653.44 - 4657.68] P:1533.48 E:0.101316 |  and Mason Mount but England on the field coming forward and the ball to the right hand side Kane
[4657.68 - 4663.52] P:1617.25 E:0.108361 |  whips it across and it came off Toloy who very nearly it was about a foot away from scoring an
[4663.52 - 4668.80] P:1515.41 E:0.098055 |  own goal in fact he defended it well and with his left in step put it beyond the far post and behind
[4668.80 - 4675.12] P:1416.79 E:0.097979 |  best passenger play from England by far and it was so so simple but just executed with quality
[4675.12 - 4681.84] P:1598.21 E:0.091734 |  great play from Eric Dyer he passes the ball through and it's that one touch ball round the corner
[4681.84 - 4686.72] P:1556.02 E:0.099279 |  from Raheem Sterling and Drew Bellingham was making that run from midfield straight into his path
[4686.72 - 4691.36] P:1532.43 E:0.099299 |  Kane peels wide then we get the cross in the box and it was much much better the type of move you
[4691.36 - 4695.84] P:1417.56 E:0.097816 |  want to see from this England team he has James corner it's a very deep one Maguire got there
[4695.84 - 4700.88] P:1412.52 E:0.106206 |  headed it back Bellingham heads it into the box Kane hooks it goalwards but it was at an awkward
[4700.88 - 4706.56] P:1446.93 E:0.099529 |  height Bellingham's taken a bang on the head actually as he was able to foul isn't it it's got to be a
[4706.56 - 4711.92] P:1570.48 E:0.101630 |  foul that John surely what you're suggesting that might be a penalty well I think the initial
[4711.92 - 4718.08] P:1593.74 E:0.093054 |  contact was outside the box but whoever that was was it Barela I don't know who it was who was
[4718.08 - 4723.36] P:1434.27 E:0.101667 |  Kane charging it was Barela really clattered into Drew Bellingham got his head to it we're seeing
[4723.36 - 4730.24] P:1404.24 E:0.092630 |  it again now and it was just outside the penalty area and as he got to it the Italian player made
[4730.24 - 4736.16] P:1409.01 E:0.092109 |  contact with Bellingham sent him sprawling down into the box I think it was outside the area
[4736.16 - 4743.20] P:1583.56 E:0.091189 |  the point of contact as you said so now we've got a stoppage for to do the appropriate checks on
[4743.28 - 4750.40] P:1604.24 E:0.093569 |  Drew Bellingham so Italy nil England nil so who's going to be called forward for England then
[4750.40 - 4756.72] P:1722.13 E:0.096745 |  we've got half an hour left obviously you know multiple substitutions can be made the five changes
[4756.72 - 4761.44] P:1545.53 E:0.092298 |  I mentioned Grealish Mount I would be very surprised if we don't see them coming onto the pitch what do
[4761.44 - 4767.36] P:1595.61 E:0.094192 |  you think yeah I think you can either yeah but possibly look at Tammy Abraham whether he's going
[4767.36 - 4773.84] P:1380.84 E:0.101992 |  to get on and get some minutes and and take Harry Kane off possibly I mean I'm really not sure John
[4773.84 - 4779.68] P:1366.30 E:0.107737 |  it's one of those where it's a difficult one to gauge what a manager would be thinking and who he
[4779.68 - 4786.88] P:1524.35 E:0.105238 |  needs to change all I know is that the move building up to that situation that forced that corner
[4786.88 - 4792.08] P:1385.21 E:0.096966 |  was exactly the type of play that you want to see from England it was slick it was one touch the
[4792.08 - 4795.92] P:1598.55 E:0.102468 |  timing of the movement and the running was good it was Bellingham driving through from midfield
[4795.92 - 4800.16] P:1643.18 E:0.097167 |  everything that you picture when you look down at that team sheet and you look at the formation
[4800.16 - 4804.56] P:1477.06 E:0.091232 |  and see how the players can move and play off each other Italy are actually going to make the
[4804.56 - 4811.36] P:1436.93 E:0.092029 |  changes first I see Tomasso Pobega of Milan AC Milan is going to come on to win his second cap
[4811.36 - 4817.76] P:1463.68 E:0.091301 |  into the midfield so he's the number six and also down there I think that's Wilfried
[4818.88 - 4823.28] P:1444.82 E:0.112124 |  and Jonto of Leeds United the new Leeds United man who's not yet played for Leeds actually after
[4823.28 - 4828.96] P:1503.11 E:0.099721 |  his move right at the end of the transfer window so that's it for Scamica who actually showed some
[4828.96 - 4835.04] P:1653.06 E:0.102379 |  nice touches yeah in the in the second half but again you know that's now eight appearances for
[4835.04 - 4839.84] P:1195.06 E:0.109271 |  him still waiting for his first goal for Italy the West Ham man so and Jonto is on for him
[4841.04 - 4848.72] P:1420.76 E:0.102460 |  and it is Barella who is being replaced by Tomasso Pobega
[4849.28 - 4857.20] P:1463.56 E:0.092530 |  so a double change from Roberto Mancini I think the England changes won't be far away in that
[4858.64 - 4862.88] P:1490.33 E:0.115083 |  no I wouldn't have thought so but I agree with you I thought Scamica had a decent game
[4863.52 - 4869.52] P:1653.30 E:0.101378 |  but he played well showed better touch than what I thought he had a couple times he brought the ball
[4869.52 - 4872.64] P:1574.77 E:0.093917 |  down and showed good good soft touch with his feet
[4873.04 - 4878.48] P:1338.64 E:0.108364 |  England replace number eight so two changes for Italy Italy Nail England Nail five live
[4879.04 - 4884.56] P:1579.41 E:0.090656 |  from the BBC Daya gets up and heads away a long ball on the edge of the penalty area
[4884.56 - 4890.88] P:1548.02 E:0.089851 |  Italy headed forward he has and Jonto with his first touch a little forward number 11 on his back
[4891.76 - 4897.68] P:1472.63 E:0.093691 |  and Toloi and it's threaded forward by Giorgio Gigno now on the right hand side with Cristante
[4897.76 - 4904.16] P:1585.11 E:0.110106 |  Harry Maguire just leans into the challenge and down goes Di Lorenzo that's a free kick free kick
[4904.16 - 4909.52] P:1660.84 E:0.094998 |  to Italy in a good position right corner of the penalty area it's clumsy from Harry Maguire I don't
[4909.52 - 4915.60] P:1484.86 E:0.101702 |  know why he tries to creep around the side of of Di Lorenzo that the danger is along the other side
[4915.60 - 4919.44] P:1525.62 E:0.091115 |  of Di Lorenzo that's straight past down the line where it's going to get slipped in there his
[4919.44 - 4925.04] P:1529.75 E:0.093274 |  position is poor Harry Maguire he tries to anticipate and step in front and and has to shove him to the
[4925.04 - 4932.40] P:1655.89 E:0.093726 |  floor and this is a dangerous situation just wide of the 18-yard box so a free kick to Italy
[4933.52 - 4937.36] P:1538.03 E:0.106261 |  in the end two hour right the four and a half thousand England fans looking down on this
[4938.96 - 4943.04] P:1531.41 E:0.107712 |  I think it's going to be Di Marco well it's Di Marco standing to the right of the ball
[4943.04 - 4946.88] P:1537.12 E:0.106109 |  if he's going to whip it in it's this routine again it is Di Marco and it goes comes off an
[4946.88 - 4951.28] P:1460.19 E:0.100050 |  England head he's well headed away actually it was Walker who was in there he did very well
[4951.36 - 4954.96] P:1485.83 E:0.117475 |  because it was a dangerous delivery England have cleared the penalty area but there's a back
[4954.96 - 4959.28] P:1524.23 E:0.113652 |  heel flick and now the ball across from the right hand side from Raspidori is beaten away
[4959.28 - 4964.80] P:1745.08 E:0.102177 |  beaten behind the near post by Nick Paulp and it's a corner it's a great header from Karl Walker
[4964.80 - 4969.36] P:1748.64 E:0.098753 |  initially we were right along the line of that John and it was I think that was just about curling
[4969.36 - 4973.84] P:1664.48 E:0.098211 |  into that far post we're certainly going to hit the post and maybe go in and Karl Walker
[4975.04 - 4978.64] P:1564.98 E:0.103492 |  just gets his neck around the ball and manages to head it outwards as well
[4978.80 - 4983.60] P:1665.57 E:0.100215 |  here's the corner Raspidori to the near post attempted flake that was blocked away and
[4983.60 - 4990.24] P:1648.44 E:0.103162 |  Janjon to hitch the shot but that comes off Harry Kane from his head high across the penalty area
[4990.24 - 4994.72] P:1594.68 E:0.107565 |  and behind the far post for another Italian corner from the left hand side Milner well England
[4994.72 - 5000.24] P:1814.80 E:0.105867 |  really under fire at the moment the Italians two or three efforts on the goal back to back really
[5000.24 - 5008.56] P:1697.13 E:0.096468 |  starting to apply a little bit of pressure so a corner this time from the left hand side
[5009.52 - 5016.88] P:1543.22 E:0.104123 |  so DeMarco has made his way over there and there is the option of taking it short
[5017.68 - 5021.12] P:1372.53 E:0.102231 |  the referee is just blowing his whistle because I think there's a bit of pushing and shoving
[5021.76 - 5026.00] P:1388.17 E:0.104979 |  and you're not going to believe this but I think Leonardo Benucci might be involved in it
[5027.04 - 5032.88] P:1469.21 E:0.097434 |  Eric Dyer as well the two of them so the referee sport into them both and then Benucci immediately
[5032.88 - 5038.80] P:1399.36 E:0.102677 |  proceeds to put himself all over the day in it comes to the near post pop comes get a one-handed
[5038.80 - 5043.76] P:1412.82 E:0.103759 |  punch on that doesn't clear the penalty area edge of the box Bellingham who's back on the field
[5043.76 - 5049.12] P:1625.39 E:0.115138 |  obviously is fouled and it's a free kick to England just outside the penalty area Harry Kane
[5049.12 - 5053.36] P:1635.30 E:0.105396 |  trained to win get the ball back to take a quick free kick and he was blocked and he's complaining
[5053.36 - 5059.04] P:1442.65 E:0.104261 |  for the referee it's that sort of night yeah it is niggly it is niggly and it's getting into that
[5059.04 - 5064.80] P:1391.72 E:0.101002 |  stage in the game where you really got to roll your sleeves up and try and produce that piece of
[5064.80 - 5070.24] P:1407.87 E:0.103565 |  calm that that cold piece of quality that's going to have a defining moment on this game I still
[5070.24 - 5075.68] P:1355.01 E:0.101340 |  feel that that's the way it's going to go Drew Bellingham does really well in that situation
[5076.32 - 5081.20] P:1443.39 E:0.098906 |  shows good anticipation to defensively to win that ball and draw the tackle on the edge of his own
[5081.52 - 5090.88] P:1654.56 E:0.090352 |  box but midway through the second half Italy nil England nil or italia ingletera as it says on
[5090.88 - 5097.76] P:1279.53 E:0.084422 |  that hoarding above the the entrance on the far side of the stadium good accent John well I'm a
[5097.76 - 5105.20] P:1395.46 E:0.096197 |  natural yeah very it's authentic it's the it's the fashion week effect that it's had on me but at
[5105.20 - 5109.04] P:1398.33 E:0.100222 |  least I know what what we're going to be wearing next year now did you think about that before
[5109.04 - 5113.68] P:1534.44 E:0.103159 |  you packed the suitcase there you better bring your best the funny thing about coming because I've
[5113.68 - 5119.04] P:1595.30 E:0.099027 |  been to Milan in fashion week before I've been to Paris in fashion week as well what four fashion
[5119.04 - 5127.28] P:1759.60 E:0.093003 |  week not four fashion week yes working for horse and hound here's Giorgio bringing the ball forward
[5127.28 - 5131.76] P:1796.69 E:0.102319 |  towards the halfway line plays it back though to Benucci behind him and the funny thing is you can
[5131.76 - 5136.16] P:1706.27 E:0.112342 |  actually spot people all over the place who are here for fashion week Benucci or hits it down that's
[5136.16 - 5141.28] P:1659.11 E:0.110108 |  a lovely touch from raspidori inside the box back onto his right foot shoots that's an excellent
[5141.28 - 5149.76] P:1548.39 E:0.116878 |  goal and it'll take the lead and England are behind here in Milan a super finish from jacka
[5149.76 - 5158.64] P:1488.58 E:0.109923 |  moe raspidori it was a real rasp and pulp diving to his left couldn't get there and England are
[5158.64 - 5165.60] P:1476.87 E:0.114653 |  facing defeat again in the nations league and facing relegation Italy won England nil that right there
[5166.16 - 5172.88] P:1527.13 E:0.112467 |  was that piece of cold quality I was talking about just a few minutes ago it was going to be
[5172.88 - 5178.96] P:1510.93 E:0.111677 |  something like that that was going to define this game and steal it for either side and raspidori
[5178.96 - 5184.48] P:1610.88 E:0.105961 |  well is turned up with a piece of real quality not just to finish the initial touch from the long ball
[5184.48 - 5189.76] P:1705.80 E:0.104345 |  from Benucci was absolutely majestic the way he's just brought it down over his shoulder but it's
[5189.76 - 5195.76] P:1480.63 E:0.105132 |  one thing here with Karl Walker the moment he's got raspidori facing out wide to the left hand side
[5196.16 - 5202.08] P:1467.19 E:0.112355 |  he cannot allow him back on his right foot his whole body shape car walker has to force him
[5202.08 - 5207.12] P:1431.29 E:0.105280 |  wide he's in a great position it's almost like I've done the work I've got back I've dealt with it
[5207.12 - 5212.64] P:1447.97 E:0.106682 |  but then his distance just backs off gives him at half a yard or more two yards shifts it onto his
[5212.64 - 5217.84] P:1590.54 E:0.099416 |  right foot and absolutely buries it in the bottom corner past Pope's left hand it's a great strike
[5217.84 - 5226.96] P:1485.88 E:0.093093 |  but should have been prevented by Karl Walker Italy won England nil great celebration as well
[5226.96 - 5231.52] P:1298.09 E:0.108394 |  he ran away did the heart sign with his hands and ran away to the halfway line actually back
[5231.52 - 5237.12] P:1406.67 E:0.114008 |  towards Mancini it actually had a little bit of tar deli about it from the world cup final
[5237.68 - 5245.20] P:1495.57 E:0.112940 |  the 82 world cup final that wasn't emotional it was but the finish as well actually had a little
[5245.20 - 5251.12] P:1583.70 E:0.101279 |  bit of a touch of that about it right well England have got to respond now England have to find
[5251.12 - 5257.84] P:1644.22 E:0.098979 |  their first goal from open play in this nation's league competition this time round and Jack Dreylich
[5257.84 - 5266.08] P:1479.62 E:0.093729 |  is is going to be sent on and also look sure as well but England now with Foden to James on the
[5266.08 - 5271.04] P:1423.46 E:0.106444 |  right hand side Foden has a look over his shoulder England facing defeat and facing relegation here
[5271.76 - 5277.36] P:1438.12 E:0.106046 |  Bellingham back to Walker and then Walker is left on the ground and that's an illegal challenge
[5278.16 - 5283.52] P:1625.56 E:0.105298 |  from the newly arrived Pope Gap so free kick to England out towards the right hand side I think
[5283.52 - 5289.92] P:1431.56 E:0.093798 |  they're going to get the changes made first of all sure as well isn't it Luke Shaw yep and uh
[5291.68 - 5295.68] P:1491.05 E:0.103836 |  just waiting for the board to be raised well it was raised there and I think we saw the number
[5295.68 - 5303.44] P:1615.77 E:0.089358 |  of Saka Bukayo Saka coming off so that is it for um no I think there might be a change of mind
[5303.44 - 5307.44] P:1539.53 E:0.097538 |  and maybe the changes aren't going to be made just yet England are going to take the free kick
[5307.44 - 5312.40] P:1467.46 E:0.091337 |  first so Saka who's almost to the halfway line is sent back you could time to score now wouldn't
[5312.40 - 5318.64] P:1406.91 E:0.097136 |  it for Bukayo Saka when he knows he's about to be substituted so England one nil down James to
[5318.64 - 5323.68] P:1544.73 E:0.110941 |  take this free kick James curls it in Daya was underneath that with the head up it sends it
[5323.68 - 5327.68] P:1790.12 E:0.114007 |  high over the top he's been challenged by a chairbeat who got in his way to Golpe
[5328.08 - 5333.12] P:1728.92 E:0.102515 |  this is so far far out you're not going to score with a header from the edge of the penalty box are
[5333.12 - 5337.68] P:1604.90 E:0.099047 |  you in the balls that narrow the cross from from Reese James was just too far out no one's going
[5337.68 - 5347.52] P:1641.62 E:0.110915 |  to be able to get any kind of parallel direction on that yeah so Bukayo Saka is off and uh Jack
[5347.52 - 5358.16] P:1753.95 E:0.096808 |  Greelish is on for his 24th cap and Luke Shaw is also coming on to the field so Shaw presumably
[5358.16 - 5364.96] P:1622.66 E:0.096266 |  you would think is going to take over as the uh as the left wing back but it's Kyle Walker yeah
[5364.96 - 5373.60] P:1391.07 E:0.097731 |  who's been taken off so Saka and Walker are off and Shaw comes on Reese James to right side
[5373.60 - 5382.64] P:1408.75 E:0.085601 |  centre back where Walker was and or back for now possibly possibly let's just see how it's no I
[5382.64 - 5388.32] P:1592.32 E:0.084145 |  think you're right John yeah I think as they've now got in position it's a back four with Eric Dyer
[5388.32 - 5394.08] P:1664.24 E:0.085167 |  and Harry Maguire centre backs Reese James at right back Luke Shaw at left back and a midfield
[5394.08 - 5400.16] P:1562.03 E:0.090563 |  of Rice Greelish and Bellingham so Rice sitting as the one in front and Bellingham and Greelish a
[5400.16 - 5404.48] P:1494.86 E:0.096420 |  little bit higher up so we've now got the two England men who can't get into the Manchester
[5404.48 - 5409.52] P:1424.16 E:0.097318 |  United Premier League starting line up at the moment on the field for England yeah Maguire and
[5409.52 - 5415.92] P:1476.55 E:0.095171 |  Shaw playing next to one another Italy leading 1-0 that fine finish from Raspidori in the 69th
[5416.48 - 5425.92] P:1486.43 E:0.099008 |  minute 68th minute I say it has been timed as and um Bukayo Saka so the left wing back how did
[5426.08 - 5433.12] P:1422.35 E:0.088233 |  you think that that worked tonight for Saka not particularly good no um has to be said there was
[5434.08 - 5442.32] P:1441.90 E:0.094963 |  not a lot of uh input into the game in terms of effecting the play um it just didn't didn't work
[5442.32 - 5447.20] P:1632.34 E:0.096695 |  out did it at all there was no no real threat from that side of the pitch just trying to work out how
[5447.20 - 5453.44] P:1538.43 E:0.094935 |  this is operating for England now with with Sterling and Greelish and Kane on the field
[5454.40 - 5459.52] P:1660.82 E:0.112530 |  so Greelish has uh pulled out to a left-sided position here Donna Rummer has been put into
[5459.52 - 5464.56] P:1432.11 E:0.109797 |  pressure by Kane but that was lovely dragged the ball back and beat Harry Kane sent him the wrong way
[5465.76 - 5470.56] P:1552.08 E:0.097625 |  and cleared it away it's composure for you wouldn't it yeah I think I think Rice and Bellingham have
[5470.56 - 5477.04] P:1654.50 E:0.099927 |  now gone to a two so it's a four two three one with Jack Greelish out on on the left hand side
[5477.04 - 5483.84] P:1615.12 E:0.088499 |  and Raheem Sterling just looks to be playing off of Harry Kane yeah Sterling is well he is wearing
[5483.84 - 5488.16] P:1401.30 E:0.099655 |  the number 10 tonight and he's actually now in the number 10 position Raheem Sterling
[5490.00 - 5495.92] P:1387.41 E:0.094642 |  right so that that's quite a significant change having gone a goal behind and uh
[5498.80 - 5504.88] P:1460.15 E:0.102050 |  and really we're into the last 20 minutes now 74th minute Italy one England nil
[5505.68 - 5510.00] P:1449.94 E:0.112719 |  dia stretching for it but it bounces through to Nyonto McGuire comes in with the challenge
[5510.00 - 5517.52] P:1670.93 E:0.104696 |  and Nyonto goes down no free kick McGuire plays it to James still inside the England half
[5518.24 - 5523.36] P:1482.80 E:0.096169 |  James back to Luxor on the left hand side and then Joel long short long and forward for Kane who
[5523.36 - 5527.52] P:1500.81 E:0.092081 |  allows it to run because he knew he was coming from an offside position but Greelish can't get there
[5527.52 - 5533.92] P:1452.71 E:0.098392 |  and it's just played across by Toloi Tagolki by Donna Rummer it is by the way still Germany nil
[5533.92 - 5543.04] P:1613.65 E:0.091465 |  Hungary one so Hungary would go to 10 points in the group Italy would go second in the table with
[5543.04 - 5547.52] P:1548.67 E:0.100566 |  eight points and England would be relegated with the scores as they are now but Hungary have got a
[5547.52 - 5552.64] P:1316.18 E:0.102343 |  very good chance if it stays like that unbelievable isn't it and German this would be Germany's first
[5552.64 - 5559.60] P:1328.84 E:0.105211 |  defeat under Hansi Flick England Germany on Monday night just picturing Zolt Nodsch score the winner
[5559.68 - 5567.36] P:1570.13 E:0.089892 |  in the final job well remembered here's McGuire plays the ball back to Polp Nick Polp has been
[5567.36 - 5573.60] P:1578.45 E:0.089043 |  unconvincing with his his footwork tonight I think that's another thing that we've taken from this
[5573.60 - 5578.08] P:1623.05 E:0.100899 |  evening and Polp now playing it out across the back line and actually sure can't keep that in and
[5578.08 - 5583.36] P:1710.20 E:0.105964 |  just as I mentioned that no poor poor piece of footwork a poor delivery then clearance from
[5583.36 - 5589.52] P:1531.12 E:0.090380 |  Nick Polp out for a throw it is but I'm not seeing that many white shirts really moving into
[5589.52 - 5593.12] P:1507.79 E:0.107707 |  space to want to receive that ball so in that case you better off just putting your foot through it
[5595.44 - 5599.68] P:1478.31 E:0.101093 |  this Italian attack breaks down on the edge of the box came to nothing 15 minutes to go
[5601.44 - 5607.28] P:1474.31 E:0.094211 |  and Dingland now in a position where it feels like it's a it's a desperate bid to salvage
[5607.28 - 5611.60] P:1526.89 E:0.092100 |  something from this match I mean they're not going to get the performance tonight
[5611.68 - 5616.16] P:1482.16 E:0.087756 |  that the hope was from England supporters that they would see something to encourage them
[5616.16 - 5621.52] P:1466.43 E:0.087567 |  eight weeks away from the World Cup but that's not happened and it's been an Italy side it's been a
[5621.52 - 5627.84] P:1554.96 E:0.090193 |  stodgy sort of game it's not been the kind of match where you would expect to see a sparkling
[5627.84 - 5632.96] P:1567.74 E:0.089862 |  performance but that certainly has not materialised for England Kane that's good nice touch to
[5632.96 - 5637.84] P:1491.57 E:0.103155 |  Fordham Fordham's away Vanuci's out of position now Fordham to his Manchester City teammate
[5637.84 - 5642.08] P:1614.69 E:0.102634 |  Grealish Grealish with a touch but Italy are back in position Shaw joins in now on the left
[5642.08 - 5646.56] P:1455.38 E:0.107759 |  low ball right across the penalty area cleared away by Italy comes out to Rice Rice Square to
[5646.56 - 5651.28] P:1524.99 E:0.108301 |  Birmingham Birmingham just outside the D stabs it to Kane Kane drives it from the angle comes back
[5651.28 - 5657.28] P:1612.99 E:0.109428 |  to him shoots again and that's a double save from Donorumma both efforts more or less at him but
[5657.28 - 5662.56] P:1530.14 E:0.106057 |  hit well by Kane Kane plays it in again from the right hand side Giorgio Stretches to block that
[5662.56 - 5667.44] P:1434.91 E:0.113482 |  and Italy are able to take it away and run it away with DiMarco but there we are England finally
[5667.44 - 5674.48] P:1466.78 E:0.106744 |  creating something and now Fordham again Fordham stabbing it back Shaw Shaw his cross by the way
[5674.48 - 5678.72] P:1384.49 E:0.102927 |  Luke Shaw that was just good banking for someone to put it into the net but there was no one there
[5678.72 - 5683.68] P:1414.74 E:0.110029 |  in white and now Sterling goes between two men to the edge of the penalty area Vanuci though stands
[5683.68 - 5689.04] P:1555.33 E:0.112041 |  up strong takes the ball off him and England now finally one nil down in the last 15 minutes have
[5689.04 - 5695.36] P:1549.65 E:0.095177 |  come to life all of a sudden England just look far far better the lovely passage of play nice
[5695.36 - 5699.68] P:1548.79 E:0.114537 |  movement running off the ball one and two touch again very similar to that one that was earlier
[5699.68 - 5703.92] P:1694.66 E:0.097173 |  and I mean how big is Donorumma in goal you can just smash the ball at the goal he's just
[5704.56 - 5709.04] P:1656.15 E:0.101007 |  it's just so he just fills the whole net doesn't he as Harry Kane really put his foot through that
[5709.04 - 5715.04] P:1609.03 E:0.098604 |  strike England pinning Italy back now Bellingham to left hand side of the corner of the box Shaw
[5715.04 - 5719.36] P:1401.34 E:0.107305 |  back to Rice again Rice is going to have a go no he beats and Yonzo and then turns it back to
[5719.76 - 5726.00] P:1709.80 E:0.109271 |  behind him Italy it's all hands to the pump now the games changed completely Italy went ahead but
[5726.00 - 5730.96] P:1567.42 E:0.117601 |  now England are all over them Vanuci puts in the challenge on Grealish but not enough for a penalty
[5730.96 - 5736.16] P:1780.83 E:0.108274 |  Grealish went down but Donorumma as the ball went between them was able to drop on it
[5737.52 - 5743.44] P:1873.20 E:0.095250 |  I mean when Kane pulled wide for that effort I don't know if maybe just firing that ball back
[5743.44 - 5747.68] P:1595.13 E:0.100271 |  across there was a lot of bodies in that six-yard box weren't there he elects to strike at Donorumma
[5748.32 - 5753.36] P:1645.27 E:0.091536 |  from quite a narrow angle and so hard to score pass I think he's just hoping that he was going
[5753.36 - 5757.52] P:1598.49 E:0.093761 |  to maybe deflect off a couple of bodies on the way through and wind up in the back of the net
[5757.52 - 5764.72] P:1492.19 E:0.081562 |  but he struck it so cleanly the big Italian goalkeeper was more than a match for it that's Matt Upson
[5764.72 - 5771.36] P:1508.83 E:0.102675 |  this is five live from the BBC England heading to defeat here in Milan one nil down Giacomo
[5771.36 - 5776.40] P:1641.95 E:0.104231 |  Raspidori but England with the change of formation changed her back for the fact that Italy are
[5776.40 - 5782.16] P:1708.87 E:0.091518 |  leading so they're trying to preserve what they've got that Grealish has brought a bit of life
[5782.16 - 5787.68] P:1659.89 E:0.099436 |  to England and we're seeing Foden in the right sort of areas now and Harry Kane forcing those two
[5787.68 - 5792.00] P:1632.67 E:0.095980 |  saves from Donorumma. I mean another player has been quite ineffective Phil Foden has he in this
[5792.00 - 5797.12] P:1463.03 E:0.104849 |  game by his standards he's not really just not in the right areas no he's not been had the space or
[5797.12 - 5801.68] P:1455.37 E:0.094809 |  the ability to to get on the ball and all of a sudden now he's looking far more threatening
[5801.68 - 5807.44] P:1384.90 E:0.108699 |  Sterling that's better and he also has been enlivened in that number 10 role Dallin and
[5807.44 - 5813.12] P:1511.70 E:0.112533 |  Nog loses it and then actually commits a foul and also writes two and that is a free kick to Italy
[5813.68 - 5818.88] P:1449.27 E:0.096634 |  and they'll be in no hurry whatsoever to take this the Italians with the
[5818.88 - 5823.36] P:1577.33 E:0.091064 |  with the one nil lead that they have we will have more from Andros Townsend once the match
[5823.36 - 5829.36] P:1564.74 E:0.087720 |  is finished he'll be joining us from back in the UK for the last 20 minutes of the program
[5829.36 - 5835.92] P:1564.63 E:0.086105 |  five live sport on air till 10 tonight but time running out for England here time running out
[5835.92 - 5840.40] P:1643.59 E:0.087510 |  in the top tier of the nation's league and everything that comes from that I mean it will
[5840.40 - 5845.92] P:1580.21 E:0.089949 |  affect the the seeding for the European Championship draw so it means that England will have a tougher
[5845.92 - 5851.92] P:1537.35 E:0.090551 |  group than they've become accustomed to but the match is still being played and where there's life
[5851.92 - 5856.96] P:1453.96 E:0.107455 |  McGuire to Kane and now here is Grealish on the left hand side Giorgio in with the challenge
[5856.96 - 5860.64] P:1440.68 E:0.116139 |  Giorgio on the net that looked like a foul from Di Lorenzo and Grealish it was
[5861.68 - 5867.20] P:1496.70 E:0.111722 |  free kick to England and a yellow card for Di Lorenzo for that challenge on the Manchester City man
[5867.20 - 5871.68] P:1641.49 E:0.105725 |  I mean I've got to say it is the one part about the Italian game that has really impressed me
[5871.68 - 5877.76] P:1467.38 E:0.103407 |  tonight their ability to hunt as a group in small groups twos and threes and fours when they've lost
[5877.76 - 5884.16] P:1445.19 E:0.093811 |  that ball the recovery they have for the the supporting team player is absolutely been brilliant
[5884.16 - 5887.44] P:1386.99 E:0.102469 |  that I think that's been a real problem for England whenever they've gotten that ball there's
[5887.44 - 5891.92] P:1508.26 E:0.103748 |  no time whatsoever to get your head up and have a look you've got shirts all around you and
[5892.80 - 5897.84] P:1517.31 E:0.097772 |  Di Lorenzo just a little bit too much they're crossed the line and made that foul and got a yellow
[5897.84 - 5905.20] P:1524.39 E:0.107151 |  card for it the goal scorer is being substituted Giacomo Raspidori is being replaced by none other
[5905.20 - 5913.20] P:1647.35 E:0.101127 |  than Manolo Gabiadini the former Southampton man now with Sampdoria who is winning his first cap
[5913.20 - 5921.28] P:1416.34 E:0.096444 |  since 2017 30 years old now and the last time he played was when Italy failed to qualify for the
[5921.28 - 5926.16] P:1503.51 E:0.095789 |  World Cup and lost here in this stadium to Sweden in the playoff England with a free kick James plays
[5926.16 - 5932.16] P:1525.06 E:0.094118 |  it in but spread at Donoroma who touches it away that was not far away from Dyer but the goalkeeper
[5932.16 - 5940.16] P:1472.10 E:0.089280 |  got his gloves to it it's that Donoroma again the scourge of England at the European Championship
[5940.16 - 5947.84] P:1388.41 E:0.097787 |  and now James has it on the left hand side Grealish Grealish was challenged there by
[5947.84 - 5953.28] P:1371.00 E:0.102897 |  Inyanto and that's a foul as well on Jack Grealish Cristante was involved in that as well by the way
[5953.28 - 5958.72] P:1373.07 E:0.100115 |  that that coming together for England and Italy Giorgino and Grealish just a few moments ago remember
[5958.72 - 5965.68] P:1609.89 E:0.087505 |  extra time in the Euro final a Giorgino challenge that might have been a red card yeah here's Rice
[5966.32 - 5972.48] P:1733.25 E:0.099034 |  to the right hand side into the last 10 minutes now we're in the 82nd minute of the match as it
[5972.48 - 5978.56] P:1796.85 E:0.107626 |  says on the huge absolutely massive screen on the far side of the ground with the two crests of the
[5978.56 - 5985.60] P:1817.23 E:0.101177 |  two countries and up there as well under the Italian crest 68 Raspidori the only goal that we've seen
[5986.24 - 5994.64] P:1708.83 E:0.093210 |  Maguire still deep inside his own half Rice he has Luke Shaw substitute Shaw plays it to
[5995.20 - 5999.84] P:1501.04 E:0.108911 |  Ken the Ken's still inside his own half Benicio's gone all the way there with him and Benicio's now
[5999.84 - 6005.84] P:1589.55 E:0.116017 |  on the right wing and Benicio plays it infield it's away from Gaby Agini but Tobega takes it onto
[6005.84 - 6011.20] P:1498.62 E:0.102448 |  the edge of the box but England put the challenge in it's actually Eric Dyer and James has now
[6011.20 - 6017.52] P:1447.53 E:0.092858 |  taken the ball away to the halfway line Stirling is there Stirling tightly watched by a chairbeam
[6018.72 - 6023.12] P:1543.20 E:0.098406 |  Grealish in the central area the three centre backs have stepped that well for Italy as well one of
[6023.12 - 6028.72] P:1576.14 E:0.094004 |  those wide ones whenever it's gone short they've gone all the way in very Italian style and you've
[6028.72 - 6035.44] P:1781.96 E:0.100496 |  got Benucci in between the pair of them just orchestrating things communicating really directing
[6035.44 - 6040.96] P:1751.75 E:0.098108 |  the play either side of him well Italy under Mancini have kept just the one clean sheet
[6040.96 - 6045.76] P:1519.04 E:0.095322 |  in our last seven matches but Mancini's made the change of system tonight going to three at the
[6045.76 - 6051.92] P:1642.12 E:0.087881 |  back to match up England and a clean sheet this evening which would be their second in the nation's
[6051.92 - 6056.24] P:1571.58 E:0.099318 |  league remember the nil nil draw against Wolves their second against England in the nation's league
[6056.24 - 6060.00] P:1429.89 E:0.103494 |  would get them the win he has Dallingham though outside the box under his left foot should put
[6060.00 - 6066.32] P:1696.29 E:0.109924 |  wildly wide but thanks to his face the 19 year old Tolloy was with him and forced him to shoot
[6066.32 - 6074.96] P:1529.92 E:0.090170 |  wide it's a tough tough effort leaning on his left foot always falling to the side just probably
[6076.48 - 6081.68] P:1580.21 E:0.095819 |  almost that desperation to want to get a shot off on goal I mean that for me John is one of the
[6081.68 - 6087.04] P:1485.10 E:0.090216 |  most concerning things for him at the moment is the lack of goal opportunity in this game and in
[6087.04 - 6093.20] P:1546.11 E:0.093604 |  previous matches it's now starting to really become an issue yes yes you know the two or three
[6093.20 - 6097.92] P:1563.20 E:0.095988 |  games in a row you can't go okay but we're now talking what five six matches where the goals
[6097.92 - 6103.04] P:1391.24 E:0.091694 |  haven't really all the chances aren't really being created yeah problem is as I say you know having
[6103.04 - 6107.84] P:1397.44 E:0.091730 |  racked up the goals in the qualifiers against the weaker teams that were in England's qualifying
[6107.84 - 6112.96] P:1661.68 E:0.089033 |  group for the World Cup scoring all of those goals that what's going to be directed at England now
[6112.96 - 6120.64] P:1598.11 E:0.080964 |  is that you're not up to it against the better teams and that's what the the facts that we're
[6120.64 - 6124.96] P:1621.71 E:0.109324 |  witnessing back up well that's what the nation's league exposes Paul played through the Gabbiadini
[6124.96 - 6130.48] P:1529.33 E:0.109908 |  there's no flag yet Gabbiadini through the top save with his legs and the ball bounces out to the
[6130.48 - 6135.28] P:1527.80 E:0.104561 |  edge of the box still no flags so he was given on side Gabbiadini now to the left hand side to
[6135.28 - 6140.56] P:1489.72 E:0.109069 |  DeMarco plays it across top couldn't get there in the middle and sliding in at the back post
[6140.56 - 6145.76] P:1564.88 E:0.103012 |  I mean it came at pace DeLorenzo arriving and he couldn't direct it on target and the ball
[6145.76 - 6150.48] P:1713.36 E:0.107646 |  eventually bounces out of play for a throw to Italy near the corner flag well the ball pinged
[6150.48 - 6154.88] P:1749.35 E:0.103203 |  right off the off the post and it came straight into lucho's feet I mean I don't think you knew
[6154.88 - 6160.64] P:1655.25 E:0.096249 |  you didn't know anything about it whatsoever but I mean that was quite loose the way Gabbiadini
[6160.64 - 6165.60] P:1671.23 E:0.095116 |  managed to get through here on goal and it was a poor finish for me actually it was a real one
[6165.60 - 6170.08] P:1628.11 E:0.093282 |  on one with with Pope and if he just picks a corner out he probably scores and it's two nil but
[6170.40 - 6175.28] P:1591.35 E:0.096070 |  I think it actually hit the foot of the post from DeMarco's cross yeah so deep pulp hit the foot
[6175.28 - 6181.84] P:1571.44 E:0.091437 |  of the post and DeLorenzo diving in sliding in as you say it had rebounded to shore who was able
[6181.84 - 6189.04] P:1576.71 E:0.085811 |  to clear it away so it is still one nil to Italy could easily have been two nil that yeah for sure
[6189.04 - 6193.52] P:1656.02 E:0.089823 |  I mean that was a great opportunity for Gabbiadini he should score he's one on one with Pope and
[6194.24 - 6195.28] P:1712.08 E:0.109903 |  should pick a corner
[6199.12 - 6202.80] P:1598.54 E:0.101328 |  so throwing Italy wants to make another change but the throwing is taken
[6203.44 - 6208.72] P:1557.70 E:0.100583 |  and Nyonto that's a nice turn shore puts in the challenge and Nyonto shrugged off it
[6208.72 - 6213.20] P:1671.18 E:0.094334 |  Grealish flicks it to shore shore plays it back to Grealish near the edge of his own box he was
[6213.20 - 6218.08] P:1630.95 E:0.097734 |  fouled Jack Grealish and the referee is going to bring it back for the free kick that England take
[6218.08 - 6222.80] P:1532.49 E:0.085988 |  quickly England urgency now we're into the last five minutes
[6226.48 - 6230.16] P:1256.38 E:0.109959 |  security announcements come out hello English fans
[6234.56 - 6237.84] P:1561.56 E:0.114804 |  well they're getting their instructions the four and a half thousand England fans I don't
[6237.84 - 6243.84] P:1271.99 E:0.100292 |  know how many of them are going to cat at but it's been another performance that raises many many
[6243.84 - 6248.80] P:1352.75 E:0.097208 |  doubts about what England will be capable of when it comes to the World Cup in two months time
[6248.80 - 6253.92] P:1484.05 E:0.094429 |  Sterling ball played forward to him the challenge came in and he was left on the ground looked
[6253.92 - 6259.84] P:1555.89 E:0.088439 |  to foul didn't it I think it's only been given as a throw in yeah whether or not the linesman
[6259.84 - 6263.68] P:1605.22 E:0.097442 |  was looking right at it and didn't flag whether or not he felt that Raheem Sterling went down a
[6263.68 - 6269.36] P:1281.66 E:0.098226 |  little bit too easy I think there was some contact as the ball was bouncing up around Raheem Sterling's
[6269.36 - 6272.72] P:1220.57 E:0.106235 |  chest but maybe not enough contact to warrant him going over
[6276.08 - 6278.48] P:1259.97 E:0.112797 |  so it is a throw in for Italy
[6284.16 - 6290.48] P:1226.96 E:0.107114 |  which is pulled up the line by a chirby, Maguire nods it forward Maguire is able to
[6291.28 - 6294.96] P:1366.36 E:0.114337 |  to find batting him batting him on the stretch Maguire has to come into the rescue
[6295.92 - 6299.92] P:1525.26 E:0.098534 |  paper planes are now being thrown from the the top tiers of the stand that's why you can hear the
[6299.92 - 6304.00] P:1476.20 E:0.094909 |  cheers from the supporters who are cheering when the paper planes reach the playing surface
[6305.60 - 6312.48] P:1555.95 E:0.092338 |  it's been a poor match decided by a very good finish actually from Raspidori unless England
[6312.48 - 6318.88] P:1521.98 E:0.092072 |  can come up with a late equaliser, Pobega leaves it for DiMarco the moment though it's Italy who
[6318.88 - 6322.48] P:1542.21 E:0.107098 |  are coming forward it's Italy on the attack and the ball is played through to the edge of the box
[6322.48 - 6327.12] P:1495.05 E:0.095033 |  it might come back to DiMarco on the edge of the area but Reiss just got there there's another
[6327.12 - 6333.28] P:1555.33 E:0.105270 |  paper aeroplane appears from above our heads Durlorezzo now just outside the area he gives
[6333.28 - 6338.88] P:1495.05 E:0.105088 |  it square Cristante with the shot but that's up and over the top left corner and into the Italian
[6338.88 - 6345.68] P:1559.57 E:0.093150 |  fans behind the fence great chance Cristante receives the ball on his left foot first touch
[6345.68 - 6351.52] P:1627.14 E:0.092588 |  across his body and he's just leaning back and blasts it over the bar if he just goes cold on
[6351.60 - 6356.00] P:1505.53 E:0.091023 |  it and just places it in the corner with a side foot I think he would have scored
[6356.64 - 6362.00] P:1482.46 E:0.095060 |  and England looking a little bit vulnerable again and the Italians having a bit of a surge late on
[6363.12 - 6365.84] P:1558.34 E:0.108133 |  and Roberto Mancini is going to make his final two changes
[6369.92 - 6372.72] P:1829.01 E:0.110092 |  Federico DiMarco is coming off
[6373.28 - 6376.40] P:1729.60 E:0.116931 |  a lovely round of applause from him
[6379.20 - 6385.20] P:1508.08 E:0.106388 |  Emerson is coming on the West Ham man to replace DiMarco
[6388.32 - 6392.80] P:1625.38 E:0.101610 |  and also leaving the field Giorgio Gigno of Chelsea that's the end of his evening
[6394.00 - 6402.24] P:1490.97 E:0.107346 |  and it will be the number seven Davide Fratesi who is actually a late call into this squad
[6402.32 - 6412.56] P:1563.22 E:0.091638 |  to replace the injured Verratti of PSG Fratesi winning his fourth cap tonight the day after his
[6412.56 - 6418.08] P:1477.17 E:0.086608 |  23rd birthday so Giorgio Gigno is off the field he's just done his thing tonight Giorgio Gigno
[6418.08 - 6423.04] P:1440.20 E:0.092247 |  this is his sort of game this one yeah yeah just keeps it ticking over sits in front of the the back
[6423.04 - 6431.20] P:1413.14 E:0.088993 |  three wins fouls passes it simple he's had a decent game but it's hard to pick any player that's really
[6432.08 - 6436.16] P:1430.26 E:0.093231 |  stood out and you've gone wow I mean it certainly from an attacking sense I thought
[6436.16 - 6440.16] P:1456.92 E:0.099160 |  DiMarco has been as good as anyone yeah DiMarco's been good I think Eric Dyer has had a pretty good
[6440.16 - 6445.92] P:1544.17 E:0.086632 |  game if I'm honest and I think he's been very good with the ball yeah I think um as England
[6445.92 - 6450.48] P:1442.69 E:0.098771 |  take a throw in deep inside their own territory we are now in the 90th minute Garas Southgate's
[6450.48 - 6457.60] P:1560.68 E:0.087006 |  made just the two changes tonight with uh with Grealish and Shaw coming on so no Mason Mount this
[6457.60 - 6464.00] P:1511.52 E:0.084706 |  evening back it comes to Rice but it's going to come for England it's going to come late
[6464.80 - 6469.52] P:1583.01 E:0.107982 |  James low ball to Sterling edge of the area there's a little bit of space for him tries to play it to
[6469.52 - 6475.36] P:1471.95 E:0.112578 |  belly him in the box but Italy did well stepped up it was actually Di Lorenzo and Di Lorenzo now
[6475.36 - 6480.08] P:1466.31 E:0.109040 |  is leading the counter attack and the ball bounces out to Inyanto on the left hand side he keeps it
[6480.08 - 6485.12] P:1480.11 E:0.113998 |  in blue shirts pouring forward even though they've got a one in a lead and Inyanto into the area
[6485.68 - 6491.28] P:1638.39 E:0.110879 |  beats James and then shoots from the angle into the back of Eric Dyer's legs and it bounces out
[6491.28 - 6496.24] P:1466.89 E:0.109707 |  for throwing on the far side and the spectators jumping over the holdings trying to get onto the
[6496.24 - 6503.36] P:1435.92 E:0.119790 |  field but he's he actually has he has jumped over the holders and he's running onto the field
[6504.08 - 6507.76] P:1442.89 E:0.107511 |  just keeping my eye on him because he seems so determined to get onto the pitch
[6508.40 - 6513.20] P:1518.78 E:0.109607 |  he's got a bit of place as well John yeah I did worry about what he might be doing but I do think
[6513.20 - 6520.08] P:1471.97 E:0.106134 |  he's just a yeah he is it's just another one of those crowd it's just another one of those pitch
[6520.08 - 6526.96] P:1520.24 E:0.096102 |  invaders and of course you know now certainly in the UK if you do this you are facing a long
[6526.96 - 6530.40] P:1478.74 E:0.100278 |  ban you're not going to another football match for a long long time and actually you're going to have
[6530.40 - 6539.28] P:1549.70 E:0.082645 |  criminal proceedings taken against you so after that it's going to be a throw in for Italy we're
[6539.28 - 6545.76] P:1371.77 E:0.090869 |  well into added time seven minutes was it six six minutes of added time to play so England
[6545.76 - 6549.84] P:1441.50 E:0.101130 |  have got six minutes less than six minutes now to come up with this equaliser otherwise it's going
[6549.84 - 6555.20] P:1718.48 E:0.098328 |  to be relegation tonight from the nation's league Grealish on the edge of his own penalty area
[6555.20 - 6562.16] P:1646.84 E:0.085040 |  plays the ball intricately inside his own box between two Italians and um and England still
[6562.16 - 6566.00] P:1558.38 E:0.097088 |  haven't cleared it from their own defensive third here he is again Grealish but he's at the wrong
[6566.00 - 6569.84] P:1551.76 E:0.092384 |  end of the pitch here he's not going to affect things at the other end England have got to get
[6569.84 - 6573.44] P:1623.50 E:0.095155 |  forward and they've got to get forward quickly and that's what they're doing with Harry Maguire
[6573.44 - 6579.60] P:1413.71 E:0.088915 |  Maguire opens his legs and takes it over the halfway line but then shore and rice now Bellingham
[6579.60 - 6586.16] P:1404.07 E:0.099189 |  Bellingham and Jontopoets arrives on him Thoden Thoden turns infield he's on his left foot
[6586.16 - 6592.56] P:1654.79 E:0.100409 |  square from him to shore Luke Shaw just outside the box back to Thoden Thoden didn't have too many
[6592.56 - 6597.36] P:1501.88 E:0.117724 |  options there and might have been fouled no he wasn't fouled Italy could break away but rice
[6597.36 - 6602.72] P:1321.49 E:0.104186 |  comes in and is able to play it over the top James now juggles the ball Sterling has it on the right
[6602.72 - 6608.88] P:1425.99 E:0.099539 |  hand side Raheem Sterling two Italians in front of him he's in the full back position uses his now
[6608.88 - 6616.32] P:1578.75 E:0.089489 |  Chelsea clubmate Rhys James Grealish out there as well Sterling takes it up once again but Italy
[6616.32 - 6619.92] P:1466.55 E:0.106837 |  have got everyone back behind the ball trying to defend this one-nil lead that they have
[6620.72 - 6626.72] P:1694.64 E:0.105158 |  back it goes for England into the centre circle shore to rice forward to rice rice is going to
[6626.72 - 6632.88] P:1663.83 E:0.112575 |  shoot down it goes but Donnarumma is able to drop onto it and clutch it very safely and securely
[6632.88 - 6639.12] P:1710.75 E:0.103666 |  into his chest that shot from Declan Rice from outside the box solid goalkeeping from Donnarumma
[6639.12 - 6644.64] P:1588.05 E:0.098421 |  had a bit of sting on that shot from Rice and it bounced awkwardly right in front of the goalkeeper
[6645.28 - 6650.24] P:1620.88 E:0.101243 |  had a bit of real swerve and dip on it but he really kept his eye on it very solid piece of
[6650.24 - 6658.72] P:1571.14 E:0.093042 |  handling from Donnarumma two and a half minutes of the six about a time have gone already Jack
[6658.72 - 6667.20] P:1577.27 E:0.114359 |  Grealish is unhappy and he's been yellow carded speaking out of turn to the referee I think he's
[6667.20 - 6671.76] P:1432.00 E:0.108796 |  frustrated by the the treatment that he's had since he's come onto the field Jack Grealish
[6671.76 - 6676.32] P:1398.66 E:0.101925 |  it's been fouled a lot he has been fouled a lot which he always is because he's that type of player
[6676.32 - 6680.00] P:1453.76 E:0.097665 |  but that reaction I'm afraid means that he's going to be suspended from Monday night right
[6680.64 - 6687.84] P:1441.88 E:0.084461 |  so he's out of the Germany game Jack Grealish well that is costly then yeah I mean you know
[6688.88 - 6692.40] P:1541.87 E:0.111848 |  he'll be in the World Cup squad I don't think there's any doubt about that is that
[6693.68 - 6698.88] P:1481.30 E:0.097987 |  but no but from his perspective yeah it's you know to miss a game because of that yeah it's not on
[6698.88 - 6703.84] P:1630.79 E:0.095555 |  yeah it's just frustration and he's so close to the referee he's right in his face and that's why

[6955.76 - 6962.96] P:1581.58 E:0.099913 |  rubbing salt into the wound really it's more for me about the performance or the lack of
[6963.04 - 6970.48] P:1471.78 E:0.097030 |  performance it has to be said in terms of as a team being able to be creative be cohesive

[6981.44 - 6986.00] P:1646.84 E:0.096454 |  scoring opportunities you know you can always take some positives from the game I thought there was

[6991.44 - 6997.92] P:1604.75 E:0.094719 |  centre backs for selection at the moment I thought he had a pretty steady game and looks to be
[6997.92 - 7001.68] P:1651.81 E:0.102487 |  more willing and comfortable to try and get on the ball and break lines with the pass and
[7002.32 - 7007.44] P:1459.00 E:0.100683 |  and try and create something from that position but it's just a pretty negative night for England
[7007.44 - 7010.96] P:1655.39 E:0.108421 |  yeah it is Harry Kane just leaving the field the reaction of the England players on the final
[7010.96 - 7015.04] P:1579.06 E:0.101186 |  whistle many of them dropped to the ground I think that was a reflection of the fact that they know
