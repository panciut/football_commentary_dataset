[191.12 - 192.92] P:1829.40 E:0.027004 |  So let's join our commentary team them
[192.92 - 199.24] P:1750.45 E:0.032236 |  We're gonna hear from Graham Taylor throughout the match the England manager at Euro 92 from Terry Butcher England captain

[217.16 - 219.56] P:1808.35 E:0.030605 |  Well for me, this is where it starts
[220.48 - 227.96] P:1726.47 E:0.027228 |  Yeah, the group games are very important and let's face it most expected defeat by France and most expected wins against
[228.44 - 232.80] P:1733.38 E:0.028283 |  Switzerland and Croatia, but this is the game that sorts out
[233.48 - 238.44] P:1663.00 E:0.029326 |  Success from failure and these are the lineups England goalkeeper James
[239.04 - 244.08] P:1679.14 E:0.030383 |  Defenders Neville Terry Campbell and Cole midfielder Beckham Gerard lampart in schools

[250.12 - 252.12] P:1748.26 E:0.031195 |  Portugal's team has only one change
[252.72 - 259.64] P:1841.05 E:0.031880 |  Nuno Gomez into the suspended and totally ineffectual car letter their goalkeeper is Ricardo their defenders are Miguel
[260.52 - 265.32] P:1769.62 E:0.028909 |  Ricardo Caballo and Rade and Nuno Valente a midfield of Castigna
[265.68 - 273.00] P:1685.18 E:0.028829 |  Manish and then three ahead of them Figo Deco Ronaldo and the one-eyed striker Nuno Gomez the referee is a good one

[281.16 - 287.32] P:1802.27 E:0.027138 |  Portugal in red shirts green shorts and red socks Ersmire just checked with both linesman
[287.52 - 293.20] P:1700.95 E:0.027317 |  The temperature is a little more than we'd have liked it in the mid 80s and humidity is up as well
[293.72 - 300.20] P:1769.29 E:0.028271 |  But there can be no excuses the pitch is perfect the arena is superb and the atmosphere is passionate
[300.80 - 306.04] P:1742.96 E:0.031101 |  England against Portugal for a place in the semi-finals of Euro 2004
[306.04 - 309.80] P:1803.60 E:0.035559 |  We're underway England defending the goal to our left in the first half
[310.20 - 315.64] P:2028.94 E:0.029038 |  And not only for the first time in the tournament to the England that the England fans respect the opposition national anthem
[315.76 - 317.76] P:1936.63 E:0.025184 |  For the first time the right number
[317.96 - 320.36] P:1880.53 E:0.021131 |  I'm not not really surprised Terry
[320.84 - 325.80] P:1685.75 E:0.028335 |  No, it's not it's great great occasion great atmosphere. This is what it's all about. You saying it's right
[325.80 - 329.52] P:1552.49 E:0.028753 |  This is where the tournament starts it does separate the men from the boys here any ambitions
[329.52 - 334.56] P:1758.43 E:0.031608 |  They've got to get through it now here's that Rooney onto all on his offside the flag is quickly up
[335.64 - 341.56] P:1749.21 E:0.026324 |  Worrying black-armed bands this evening in memory of the England fan who was starved to death
[342.40 - 344.40] P:1880.50 E:0.028514 |  here in Lisbon
[344.52 - 346.52] P:1946.70 E:0.029482 |  It's a free kick to Portugal
[346.84 - 351.56] P:1842.52 E:0.035017 |  Ricardo with a gray goalkeeper in Jersey outside of his shorts
[352.96 - 355.52] P:1769.54 E:0.026957 |  They supposed to be a penalty expert Ricardo
[356.16 - 358.76] P:1593.09 E:0.024044 |  Heaven help us if he's employed later in the game
[359.64 - 365.48] P:1688.04 E:0.029832 |  Remember a silver goal or penalties and necessary will settle this quarter final tie
[365.80 - 368.32] P:1744.79 E:0.025704 |  If scores a level at the end of 90 minutes
[368.48 - 373.84] P:1558.33 E:0.025489 |  The ball is played down the right back and run into the defender and run a but it's headed away
[374.40 - 376.84] P:1747.14 E:0.033178 |  Here's Ronaldo and immediately Gary Neville gets in a good
[377.84 - 381.76] P:1764.21 E:0.026156 |  John Terry gets in a good aggressive challenge and the ball's out of play
[381.76 - 385.60] P:1520.77 E:0.022627 |  It's gonna be a throw-in to Portugal new to go new to Valenti one of five
[386.44 - 389.44] P:1672.10 E:0.026193 |  Champions League winners from Porter in this Portuguese side
[389.96 - 391.56] P:1603.60 E:0.020345 |  here's
[391.56 - 395.56] P:1508.15 E:0.025905 |  Ronaldo left for Deco perhaps Chelsea bound Deco
[396.00 - 402.36] P:1595.54 E:0.026244 |  To the left of the England penalty here and he gets the cross in low simple clearance by Terry to Gerard and Gerard hits it
[402.40 - 408.92] P:1610.29 E:0.023002 |  Towards the halfway line England quite deep there Terry are you expecting a fairly cautious approach over the first 15 minutes?
[408.92 - 412.68] P:1529.79 E:0.027495 |  Yeah, they haven't really settled down yet England and past the ball. It's been all Portugal
[412.68 - 416.24] P:1744.40 E:0.028211 |  I think just showing a few signs of nerves there trying to get the ball down and playing
[416.24 - 419.24] P:1882.47 E:0.029157 |  I think the Portuguese system is gonna frustrate England
[419.36 - 424.12] P:1683.60 E:0.029424 |  But already we saw early on Owen just offside from a pass from Rooney. He's playing on the last
[425.04 - 428.68] P:1629.74 E:0.029326 |  Defender is playing on the shoulder of the last defender. There is space behind that Portugal back for
[429.08 - 432.72] P:1848.68 E:0.029782 |  Interesting the costina is sticking pretty close to Wayne really at the moment
[432.84 - 438.60] P:1844.56 E:0.031909 |  Here's Sol Campbell for England to Gerard back to Campbell England with the one to 11
[438.60 - 442.92] P:1927.05 E:0.029908 |  I there's any been the one change that was of course when lampard was injured
[443.36 - 447.12] P:1924.31 E:0.029027 |  For the first game. It's hit outfield now by David James
[458.68 - 464.44] P:1717.66 E:0.034960 |  And the international threat and after just two minutes he puts England in front
[464.44 - 469.76] P:1808.43 E:0.030300 |  It was a true striker finish wonderfully slip the smash past Ricardo
[470.16 - 472.16] P:1751.68 E:0.031451 |  England won Portugal now
[472.36 - 478.32] P:1598.94 E:0.035062 |  Well, well, well is this scripted? I can't believe it. It was actually flicked on into Michael Owens path by Castigna
[478.32 - 482.48] P:1700.15 E:0.031749 |  Trying to do a job on Rooney. He only flicked it past the two center defenders
[482.48 - 485.04] P:1623.15 E:0.034502 |  It was awkward for Michael Owen to take he had to do a
[485.56 - 491.72] P:1608.29 E:0.034072 |  360 degree turn and flick it with the outside of his right foot which he did it flew past Ricardo Ricardo no chance
[491.72 - 496.12] P:1529.40 E:0.034516 |  And that's the goal we've all been waiting for has taken four games to get there Michael Owen
[496.56 - 502.04] P:1475.63 E:0.030711 |  Fantastic finish to one opportunity. He's had in the game. I think it may have been his first touch in the match. It's one nil England
[502.88 - 504.08] P:1492.42 E:0.024167 |  Well
[504.08 - 508.16] P:1625.71 E:0.027147 |  It was instinct. He didn't have time to think about it. I think that was a great thing about it
[508.32 - 511.36] P:1622.59 E:0.028506 |  Terry you know earlier chances that I might have fallen his way in this tournament
[511.36 - 516.96] P:1689.95 E:0.025619 |  He's had too much time to think about it. He has like a little confidence. That was pure instinct and
[517.48 - 523.84] P:1685.75 E:0.025837 |  The only data have my mind is that as my kingdom reminds me Paul schools scored early on in I'm hoping
[524.08 - 530.16] P:1569.37 E:0.026782 |  Against Portugal similar time. Yeah, well, do you look at Christ's score out against England as well and that only inspired England to come back
[530.16 - 536.08] P:1671.73 E:0.029281 |  Let's hope it doesn't inspire Portugal Deco looking for Nuno Gomez good header back by Gary Neville to David James
[536.08 - 540.84] P:1803.33 E:0.026613 |  And oh by the way has created a little bit of English history because he's become the first
[541.56 - 545.04] P:1744.94 E:0.027026 |  England international to score in four successive
[545.96 - 550.44] P:1632.97 E:0.026853 |  Championship finals whether it's a World Cup or a European Championship Jeff first. It's going in three
[550.76 - 556.76] P:1630.29 E:0.028052 |  Owen makes it forward. It's his 20 second goal for England Gerard looking for Owen again
[556.76 - 560.34] P:1726.44 E:0.030312 |  That's intercepted by Nuno Valente and how will Portugal respond?
[560.64 - 567.00] P:1725.42 E:0.030613 |  Ronaldo comes forward Gerard gets there Gerard aggressively in and fairly wins the ball puts you putting it out of play
[567.00 - 573.12] P:1574.78 E:0.025849 |  I'll bring in Grand Taylor in just a moment, but here's a throw in for Portugal taken by Ronaldo headed down by Figo on by
[573.12 - 579.48] P:1718.33 E:0.029046 |  Maniche and then Beckham's in there Beckham gives it away though who is club colleague a Figo Figo runs it out of play
[579.48 - 581.48] P:1929.81 E:0.030758 |  And it's a thing of throwing Graham
[582.12 - 584.12] P:1912.78 E:0.030444 |  Can you hear me Graham?
[584.12 - 586.12] P:1724.83 E:0.037781 |  I can just hear you say
[586.56 - 593.72] P:1726.62 E:0.033527 |  All I can say is that isn't that the fella that some people saying shouldn't have been dropped should not be in this
[594.32 - 597.24] P:1712.33 E:0.034046 |  It was always on a tremendous finish by him
[601.00 - 606.12] P:1644.89 E:0.029561 |  So skulls to score to no one scored and that really's only hit forward lap part two
[606.36 - 611.44] P:1689.71 E:0.029124 |  Here's Figo for Portugal stung by that early blow but Figo does well gets the cross into the penalty
[611.44 - 616.24] P:1735.76 E:0.033107 |  Ronaldo's there, Ronaldo's right foot shot hits an offender and James punches on the ball
[616.24 - 617.72] P:1802.66 E:0.030679 |  There was a good cross from Figo
[617.72 - 621.60] P:1666.19 E:0.033852 |  He managed to wriggle past Gary Neville got the cross to win all the way across the six yard line
[621.60 - 626.96] P:1700.27 E:0.031080 |  I think we went to Ronaldo his first shot was blocked by Ashley Cole the fell to me had to spin and hit it on the turn
[626.96 - 627.76] P:1532.05 E:0.031416 |  And there was Campbell
[627.76 - 631.08] P:1511.12 E:0.032324 |  There was to Cole as well to go and block the shot the ball going through the David James
[631.08 - 636.48] P:1718.16 E:0.026775 |  That's the second file by Deco and Gerard and this time our smile allowed it to go unchecked
[636.96 - 642.36] P:1673.59 E:0.025449 |  And that's hit forward by Gary Neville towards Wayne Rooney left of the Portuguese penalty area
[642.36 - 646.36] P:1638.77 E:0.027014 |  Our Cavalio goes with him Rooney is the ball Rooney checks on to his left foot
[646.68 - 650.40] P:1797.74 E:0.024869 |  Yes the cross ended they can flexion no it didn't it's behind for a goal kick
[650.40 - 653.76] P:1805.72 E:0.031285 |  I'll tell you what Gerard is very key. He's the one that's sitting on Deco
[653.76 - 658.84] P:1490.03 E:0.029554 |  He's the one that's gonna patrol in front of his back for whenever the wide applies by getting the ball into the lamp
[658.84 - 662.72] P:1524.23 E:0.027991 |  Part or is Gerard that's coming out to try and make it a 2v1 situation
[663.20 - 666.60] P:1597.46 E:0.029137 |  That Mike's reminding me of all the things I don't want to be reminded of
[667.16 - 672.28] P:1620.83 E:0.028036 |  He's just said of course Owen did score to put us in front against Brazil and the World Cup quarter
[672.28 - 677.32] P:1736.21 E:0.025387 |  Will you just sit there and just don't even concentrate you come on when you're in commentary
[677.88 - 680.52] P:1633.63 E:0.021961 |  Honest to goodness. She don't want to hear anything like that to you Terry
[680.88 - 682.96] P:1729.29 E:0.025330 |  No, you certainly don't have to be a help, you know
[683.12 - 687.00] P:1399.22 E:0.027133 |  Well, we're in the one and up against France and one and up against Brazil and lost those matches
[687.00 - 691.88] P:1548.88 E:0.023681 |  But you know it's sometimes a goal when you score a goal very early on yes
[691.88 - 694.00] P:1537.88 E:0.023992 |  I can tell you down but can inspire the opposition
[694.00 - 698.20] P:1610.80 E:0.027202 |  So even they've got to just settle down now make some passes look for the long ball through to Owen
[698.20 - 702.16] P:1634.63 E:0.026130 |  Who's on the back on the shoulder that asked to defend is now still don't write this defensive pair at all
[702.16 - 706.02] P:1537.86 E:0.026763 |  Owen and Rooney are running off them into space because the two fullbacks push on all the time
[706.28 - 707.68] P:1743.68 E:0.022398 |  St. Michael
[707.68 - 713.92] P:1815.02 E:0.027069 |  The ball is with skulls on the far side of the field doesn't he look sparky since he got the goal in the last game
[714.88 - 719.16] P:1534.21 E:0.018913 |  It's coming right for England now. What about David Beckham? Come on Beckham. We start well
[719.16 - 720.32] P:1353.01 E:0.026712 |  I think he started off well
[720.32 - 724.60] P:1517.04 E:0.027978 |  He's having to do a more defensive job at the moment is still frenetic is still frantic in them
[724.68 - 727.60] P:1515.07 E:0.034034 |  What happens is the the Portuguese fullbacks are pushing down?
[728.24 - 730.32] P:1551.68 E:0.034676 |  Miguel pushing down on the skulls on the other side
[730.32 - 735.56] P:1532.24 E:0.031997 |  Who never went is pushing down on to onto Beckham sometimes leaving space for Michael Owen in behind the fullback area
[735.56 - 741.00] P:1599.23 E:0.032856 |  Well, Castein is following and Rooney everywhere never with a throwing towards the goal scorer Michael on and Dranny
[741.40 - 745.06] P:1594.20 E:0.032755 |  Aggressively in but on holds them off. You see what a goal will do for you
[745.28 - 746.40] P:1564.92 E:0.017114 |  Owen
[746.40 - 750.32] P:1595.18 E:0.027708 |  Into lampard and back to Gary Neville. There's no width on the England left
[750.32 - 755.92] P:1784.33 E:0.026460 |  So it's staying on the right side Beckham into own Gerard's available and in room Gerard comes forward
[755.92 - 757.36] P:1900.28 E:0.029835 |  Try to squeeze it through to Rooney
[757.36 - 760.72] P:1707.10 E:0.027053 |  It was a block back to senior and then lampard gets in a tackle
[760.72 - 764.76] P:1649.23 E:0.029356 |  But it's run away by Miguel on the far side of the field England leading one
[764.76 - 770.44] P:1605.79 E:0.030115 |  No, the goal from Michael Owen after two and a half minutes and you're listening to five live on the BBC
[771.32 - 777.40] P:1715.31 E:0.028669 |  The ball given away by Miguel should have been cut out by Beckham taken up by Louis Figo nearly eight minutes played
[777.40 - 781.44] P:1623.48 E:0.030282 |  Figo cuts in field looks for no no Gomez the battle back from the new Gomez was bruer
[781.88 - 785.64] P:1834.20 E:0.031818 |  Manish should skipping just over the crossbar and I think James got a finger to it
[785.64 - 788.84] P:1769.16 E:0.029584 |  It's behind for a corner. Yeah, the ball just breaking to money
[788.84 - 794.48] P:1672.10 E:0.033585 |  So I think it was just outside the box and decided to hit it first time a swerving right footer just underneath the crossbar
[794.48 - 796.76] P:1609.47 E:0.029714 |  I think David James got the corner my thing
[796.76 - 800.72] P:1750.79 E:0.031814 |  So it's a corner to support to go corner taking short swing it towards the near post goes a long way
[800.72 - 806.80] P:1698.40 E:0.031321 |  Scalpel there social now though Ronaldo falls over going for a penalty not given by Ersmire. I told you's a good referee
[807.68 - 810.92] P:1714.10 E:0.028802 |  Balls at a play on the far side of the field and it will be a throw into England
[810.92 - 813.40] P:1383.20 E:0.026884 |  That's a problem the ball comes in on the corner, and I think it's
[814.20 - 818.44] P:1539.79 E:0.025732 |  Hit that thing was actually cold just seems to bounce off his knees in the box
[818.44 - 821.12] P:1625.04 E:0.029856 |  I think it was sold caramel that blocked the shot from Ronaldo, but
[821.56 - 822.96] P:1893.62 E:0.024943 |  It's plenty defending for me
[822.96 - 828.04] P:1817.15 E:0.031183 |  They just got to be more authoritative when it comes to set pieces and when it comes to defending just get rid of the ball
[828.04 - 831.84] P:1743.71 E:0.027687 |  Get it out be professional call with a throw in towards the halfway line Miguel
[831.84 - 838.00] P:1574.87 E:0.023683 |  Knucks it high into the air Gerard jumps heads it into the center circle, but here come Portugal again
[838.16 - 844.40] P:1609.17 E:0.023993 |  It's with no Valentino forward to Ronaldo down the near touch line the Portuguese left and he cuts in field
[844.40 - 850.08] P:1663.82 E:0.022936 |  Then he checks again clicks it wide to do the valente now to Maniche midway inside England's half
[850.20 - 857.28] P:1705.26 E:0.027895 |  The run by Deco Maniche should slow instead headed away by Terry and schools has the ball schools sort of the halfway line
[857.28 - 861.44] P:1721.06 E:0.026198 |  But there's quite a gap between midfield and attack at the moment for England schools ready for support
[861.44 - 866.76] P:1720.57 E:0.031446 |  They caught a possession a tackle takes it up tackle launches it to Figo into the penalty area right side
[870.52 - 872.52] P:1670.39 E:0.028584 |  Corner must contain an affliction
[872.64 - 878.00] P:1587.32 E:0.035672 |  Well Paul's goals took an eternity in the middle of the park didn't know where to play the ball across coming in from Maniche
[878.00 - 883.36] P:1607.82 E:0.033101 |  And it came off I think it came off Deco for a goal kick with the referees given a corner this time the left hand side second
[883.36 - 890.36] P:1694.42 E:0.026091 |  One to Portugal England didn't really protest very much nearly 10 minutes gone England need 1-0 the goal from Michael Owen
[891.64 - 895.04] P:1728.72 E:0.024620 |  Corner take it played in good punch by David James
[895.20 - 898.16] P:1837.70 E:0.026538 |  That's the way you want to see the goalkeeper fist the ball away to save deep
[898.16 - 901.20] P:1611.50 E:0.028328 |  It went 50 yards and I had a plate for a throw in figure came short
[901.20 - 906.04] P:1591.85 E:0.026656 |  There was still five in in the box the ball was our it in in Swinger right foot from the left hand side James came out
[906.04 - 911.28] P:1649.50 E:0.029819 |  Got a good fist to it the ball went out for a throw and that's what you want to see exactly right England just a little deep Terry
[911.92 - 916.00] P:1685.81 E:0.029023 |  It's worrying me is it because Portugal are pressing the back or England are playing deep well
[916.00 - 919.24] P:1531.11 E:0.030510 |  I've got a reaction from Portugal didn't we I mean about eight minutes ago England scored
[919.32 - 922.60] P:1511.67 E:0.028447 |  It has been a positive reaction from Portugal forced a couple of corners
[922.60 - 928.72] P:1650.08 E:0.030861 |  Oh Campbell put Cole into but above of there, but Cole did well finding his arsenal colleague once more and now forward to Michael
[928.72 - 933.60] P:1770.45 E:0.030913 |  Oh, and if Rooney's gonna be mark on will have room on over the halfway line and then oh
[933.60 - 935.40] P:1692.27 E:0.032311 |  I don't know what he was thinking there Michael
[935.40 - 941.00] P:1753.79 E:0.026189 |  But his first touch was poor and the ball is back with none of a lent it into Figo well done
[941.00 - 945.20] P:1693.06 E:0.028905 |  Frank lamp are taking the ball off figure and then I think he thought there three kickers gonna be awarded
[945.20 - 951.88] P:1770.58 E:0.034834 |  The ball squats away to on on in towards Rooney Rooney into the penalty block three kicking them come on David Beckham
[952.84 - 956.68] P:1670.09 E:0.036840 |  Our blocking Rooney then the ball luckily broke to Michael on on the right hand side
[956.68 - 960.32] P:1680.71 E:0.033051 |  He had one thought in his mind to play Rooney his strike partner dead center of goal
[960.32 - 964.40] P:1671.32 E:0.028616 |  Rooney's touch was to the to the left hand side Cavalaro came out and blocked him
[964.40 - 970.56] P:1627.73 E:0.026911 |  He's protesting that he wasn't foul or didn't foul when Rooney, but it's Beckham territory. It's right of center about
[971.16 - 973.16] P:1614.03 E:0.026999 |  24 25 yards out
[973.84 - 981.48] P:1809.66 E:0.026691 |  Ricardo beware he's leaning against up one of the uprights trying to organize the Portuguese wall
[982.04 - 989.04] P:1900.47 E:0.028602 |  Ersmire will try to make sure that it's back fully ten yards loose Figo's just standing four or five yards away from Israel Madrid Colley
[989.04 - 993.60] P:1888.15 E:0.026803 |  And Beckham is saying the wall is not ten yards back and of course, it's not ten yards back
[993.76 - 998.84] P:1954.96 E:0.028721 |  Well, you can't be because you gave you by the cuts of the grass don't you the way the grass is cut at like six yards six meters
[999.16 - 1001.16] P:1958.57 E:0.028960 |  Still not back ten ten yards
[1001.36 - 1006.00] P:1923.00 E:0.032636 |  Well, actually what happened there was the Beckham actually moved the ball back to give himself a little bit more room and new
[1006.00 - 1012.52] P:1971.96 E:0.029359 |  Novalendi at the nerve to complain so it's a long time before this free kick is taken nearly 12 minutes gone England
[1012.52 - 1017.76] P:1872.99 E:0.032103 |  The goal up through Michael own it's Beckham territory that the wall is nowhere near ten yards away
[1017.76 - 1023.80] P:1956.05 E:0.026382 |  I don't even take yards clear Beckham's gonna take the free kick anyway right footed sorting in takes an affection
[1023.84 - 1028.04] P:1770.21 E:0.032765 |  Rune's there really shot blocked by the goalkeeper Ricardo and behind for a corner
[1028.64 - 1033.04] P:1569.83 E:0.034441 |  Yeah, ball played Wayne really the boat up in there. You're right. The wall was never ten yards away
[1033.04 - 1035.04] P:1761.14 E:0.027293 |  No, he fight it in it in close to game
[1035.52 - 1040.56] P:1731.80 E:0.034277 |  Beckham shot was blocked in the felt a Rooney, but it was really wide on the right hand side Ricardo came out
[1040.56 - 1046.32] P:1873.83 E:0.030887 |  Well to block it right on the goal line corner England. I mean, there's no excuse for the referee not knowing that wasn't ten yards
[1047.16 - 1052.36] P:1833.04 E:0.025607 |  Beckham to take the corner from the right hand side five white shirts to aim at inside the penalty
[1052.36 - 1057.76] P:1726.77 E:0.028550 |  It's played in deep lamp or is there so to his combo ball breaks to Michael on left edge of the penalty here
[1057.76 - 1062.58] P:1624.25 E:0.027677 |  He's tackling beaten by Ronaldo Ronaldo back to Castigna and Castigna waves it upfield
[1062.58 - 1066.20] P:1765.13 E:0.027159 |  But straight out of play and it's a throw into England on the far side of the field
[1066.20 - 1068.32] P:1601.69 E:0.022813 |  You think the referee looks a bit like Richard Branson?
[1069.80 - 1071.92] P:1531.42 E:0.021056 |  No, no, I think he does all right
[1072.64 - 1075.60] P:1569.98 E:0.023594 |  Trust you. I think your referees like Richard Branson as well at times
[1076.48 - 1078.32] P:1725.26 E:0.025080 |  Now listen just lay off them, you know
[1078.32 - 1084.60] P:1666.59 E:0.028773 |  We don't want to antagonize them even from this distance skulls in the far side well played skulls into lampard lampard then
[1085.04 - 1090.36] P:1722.13 E:0.026767 |  Rather loose with possession and it's cleared away to none of Gomez back to Deco and Deco
[1090.64 - 1094.76] P:1669.80 E:0.027696 |  Hit the ball to the left hand side brilliantly brought done by the right five Manish
[1094.76 - 1099.20] P:1743.97 E:0.026924 |  Who's inside the center circle line stepping away from Rooney Manish forward to Deco?
[1099.20 - 1100.80] P:1685.97 E:0.025495 |  Deco's getting a lot of room
[1100.80 - 1104.64] P:1645.36 E:0.031504 |  Deco now has Ronaldo ahead of him plays it behind the United York sir
[1104.68 - 1106.56] P:1766.98 E:0.028501 |  And it's I just play for a throw it
[1106.56 - 1108.32] P:1725.61 E:0.030539 |  I think there's good coverage on the England midfield
[1108.32 - 1112.00] P:1469.32 E:0.031138 |  They're forming a good screen in front of their back for the back for really up for it tonight
[1112.20 - 1118.20] P:1401.87 E:0.029788 |  Anything I would say is very difficult to build it from the back and when England do get their wide midfield players and skulls and Beckham on the ball
[1118.28 - 1121.20] P:1460.64 E:0.026401 |  They've got to keep it better because that's the space on the plant
[1122.12 - 1124.64] P:1709.79 E:0.029387 |  Well, no country has ever lost the
[1125.08 - 1129.76] P:1640.48 E:0.028046 |  Sorry, only one country's lost the first game the European Championship and come back to win it
[1129.76 - 1133.80] P:1804.60 E:0.027751 |  That was Holland in 1988. Well, both these countries lost their opening game
[1134.68 - 1142.04] P:1604.86 E:0.029416 |  Obviously both of them have a clear chance in Euro 2004 England leading by one goal to nil Ronaldo was dying
[1143.04 - 1149.52] P:1788.49 E:0.026937 |  Filed by Ashley Cole according to the linesman who's only a couple of yards away nice set pieces Terry set pieces
[1149.52 - 1153.96] P:1637.32 E:0.028745 |  Yeah, it's a free kickers never a free kick as well. He really died for that did Ronaldo
[1153.96 - 1158.32] P:1635.01 E:0.031977 |  But it's convinced the lines and it's convinced the referee. This is where England. This is there Achilles heel
[1158.32 - 1159.68] P:1629.60 E:0.029312 |  They've got to defend this well
[1159.68 - 1164.12] P:1802.50 E:0.027667 |  It's a couple of yards in from the right corner fly Deco takes it it's rolled in
[1164.12 - 1169.00] P:1698.44 E:0.029548 |  I comes James absolutely nowhere and it's headed behind by John Terry for another corner
[1169.00 - 1172.36] P:1603.68 E:0.027306 |  Well, don't mind that it's virtually the same sort of free kick or corner situation
[1172.36 - 1175.60] P:1434.97 E:0.026938 |  The the free kick was about a yard inside his two balls on the pitch at the moment
[1175.84 - 1181.64] P:1453.50 E:0.026688 |  But now it's a corner well played John Terry gets his head to the ball be positive clear your lines and then deal with it after that
[1181.64 - 1187.44] P:1699.37 E:0.028723 |  Deco from the right once more and he swirls it behind the goal. Thank you very much Deco. That's great stuff
[1188.44 - 1191.24] P:1731.54 E:0.020089 |  We'll take that. Yeah, I don't mind that at least yeah
[1191.24 - 1195.08] P:1372.91 E:0.025975 |  I mean I would imagine Scolari down the sideline on the touch line is gone bananas because
[1195.36 - 1198.52] P:1740.52 E:0.031680 |  It's all about England not particularly strong on set piece defending
[1198.52 - 1201.84] P:1764.15 E:0.033986 |  The last thing you want is a corner taker to put the ball behind for a goal kick
[1201.84 - 1206.08] P:1882.92 E:0.032478 |  But it gives a chance for England to settle down a little bit get their shape get a bit of a breather
[1206.28 - 1208.28] P:1954.33 E:0.024768 |  And then so I'm worked the way up the pitch
[1208.68 - 1212.68] P:1548.42 E:0.028454 |  Quarter of an hour gone only five more quarters of an hour to go
[1213.48 - 1215.16] P:1690.60 E:0.020358 |  Seems a long time
[1215.36 - 1219.40] P:1667.46 E:0.024708 |  Beckham trying to find really down the right side and hits that I had a play
[1219.40 - 1225.88] P:1628.24 E:0.023769 |  It's gonna be a throw in to Portugal and you know Valente the left back to take it Figo shows Figo and
[1226.44 - 1233.40] P:1663.77 E:0.030049 |  Ronaldo switch flanks at the moment Figo's down the left and Figo has the ball new to Valente in support Figo cutting in towards Gary
[1233.40 - 1235.28] P:1634.82 E:0.029356 |  Never guess the cross end, but thank you very much
[1235.28 - 1236.80] P:1805.15 E:0.030542 |  That's straight into the under David James
[1236.80 - 1241.92] P:1675.22 E:0.032041 |  There's still only one in the box isn't there when Figo crossed the ball Beckham and Gary now will did a good job like we were
[1241.96 - 1247.76] P:1550.18 E:0.026711 |  Before pushed the wide player wide so his cross came in and there's only one Portuguese player in a box and David James made an easy
[1247.76 - 1251.84] P:1688.56 E:0.026400 |  Cat cherry this is the third time I've seen Portugal in Euro 2004
[1251.84 - 1255.76] P:1694.44 E:0.027350 |  They don't get players into the box team in the end had lots of chances against Spain
[1255.76 - 1259.28] P:1747.88 E:0.026682 |  But only because Spain were frantically searching for an equalizer
[1260.32 - 1265.02] P:1712.59 E:0.028852 |  So let's see how they do when they're a goal down well played Ashley Cole
[1265.72 - 1270.84] P:1584.72 E:0.025760 |  Tackling Ronaldo on the far side of the field. They've got to be tight on Ronaldo make him feel uncomfortable
[1271.28 - 1278.80] P:1680.18 E:0.025103 |  Physically uncomfortable Maniche for the next one crossfield pass to the left side and Nunavallente Nunavallente just over the halfway line
[1279.12 - 1283.26] P:1740.89 E:0.024835 |  Into Castigna Castigna now to Maniche once more Maniche
[1283.96 - 1289.16] P:1713.49 E:0.028283 |  Prefer to petite in this Portuguese 11 much more attack minded and they may need him now
[1289.24 - 1293.56] P:1664.67 E:0.028863 |  Good pass to the left once more to Nunavallente Nunavallente moving forward
[1293.56 - 1300.72] P:1676.38 E:0.026482 |  Then he leaves it for Luis Figo faced by David Beckham Beckham gets a boot there as the cross was played and the lampard plays
[1300.76 - 1305.46] P:1648.47 E:0.028163 |  It away to Beckham once more back to lampard old careless from Frank lampard England
[1305.84 - 1310.88] P:1807.65 E:0.029077 |  Concealing possession on occasion as usual too easily Nunavallente with a cross very deep
[1310.88 - 1316.44] P:1767.43 E:0.027907 |  Ronaldo brings it down right edge of the penalty area call is watching it's played back Miguel with a shot
[1316.44 - 1321.16] P:1761.99 E:0.032682 |  But that was not only over the crossbar. It was also worldwide and it's another goal kick to England
[1321.16 - 1322.56] P:1755.03 E:0.033882 |  There were still only two players in the box
[1322.56 - 1326.88] P:1549.57 E:0.031668 |  It was a lovely glorious pass from Figo the left wing right across to Ronaldo on the right hand side
[1326.88 - 1329.88] P:1564.18 E:0.030801 |  Ashley Cole closed him down well again. I think Ashley Cole's been told
[1330.12 - 1333.80] P:1672.87 E:0.030461 |  Threaten Ronaldo's first touch very long crossfield passes threatened the first touch
[1333.80 - 1335.48] P:1709.65 E:0.029337 |  She don't allow him to get a run at you
[1335.48 - 1339.44] P:1618.32 E:0.030369 |  But he laid it back to Miguel who plays over the bar from like 25 yards at a slight angle
[1339.44 - 1343.48] P:1667.85 E:0.026678 |  So, you know, I would think it's good defending from England so far Michael on his score
[1343.48 - 1346.28] P:1783.41 E:0.028561 |  He's that 20 sixth goal in an England shirt tonight
[1346.84 - 1352.76] P:1554.32 E:0.023484 |  That's why England lead 1-0 and Michael on has moved into the top 10 of England goal scorers
[1353.48 - 1356.88] P:1713.60 E:0.027255 |  On after the ball and keeping it in play and he does very well
[1356.88 - 1361.76] P:1764.10 E:0.029933 |  Get it back. He's there inside the penalty. We go reacts brilliantly back. I'm as there back
[1361.76 - 1367.84] P:1703.16 E:0.033078 |  I'm careful inner forward cross in from Beckham takes an affection lifts over the cost bar corner and that all came from Michael on
[1368.40 - 1371.80] P:1687.88 E:0.029333 |  He's having an absolute blind Michael on so far. He's chasing balls
[1371.80 - 1377.12] P:1742.10 E:0.031096 |  There's lots of space behind this Portuguese defense. We said that before and it's happening now corner team quickly back
[1377.12 - 1384.04] P:1873.78 E:0.024854 |  To Owen just to the right of the penalty here back to Beckham and Beckham crosses right footed good header away
[1384.32 - 1391.08] P:1647.36 E:0.026088 |  There are appeals by the Portuguese defenders that there was a foul by Rooney not given another good ball by Beckham finding Jarrod on the
[1391.08 - 1396.00] P:1741.66 E:0.034043 |  Skull and towards all on the outside over the crossbar just over the crossbar
[1396.44 - 1398.16] P:1746.99 E:0.028140 |  Well, the Spice is there again
[1398.16 - 1402.90] P:1565.75 E:0.031295 |  It was a ball from Beckham to the on the right hand side going back towards his own goal played the ball to Jarrod
[1402.90 - 1406.40] P:1641.74 E:0.030906 |  Jarrod played the first time to Skulls who lifted over the top of the Portuguese defense
[1406.44 - 1411.36] P:1674.91 E:0.032234 |  Michael on was in and if Michael on could have squared it when really had a tap in but Michael on was pressed
[1411.76 - 1414.92] P:1666.93 E:0.028165 |  That he fender came across pretty quickly could only lift it just over the crossbar
[1414.92 - 1415.72] P:1803.04 E:0.031667 |  But you know something cherry
[1415.72 - 1421.16] P:1720.52 E:0.026094 |  I think that's a good sign because I think the Michael on of the last month or so might have been looking to lay it off
[1421.44 - 1424.00] P:1680.85 E:0.027326 |  Reluctant to take the responsibility himself now
[1424.04 - 1426.40] P:1776.77 E:0.023345 |  He feels that he can take that responsibility
[1426.64 - 1433.00] P:1741.56 E:0.026546 |  He is scored tonight after two and a half minutes and here in the Estadio deluz England lead Portugal the host by a
[1433.04 - 1439.12] P:1666.44 E:0.028077 |  Goldenell and they're playing well now Beckham back to never Neville drives it forward own chases after it
[1439.12 - 1445.62] P:1692.44 E:0.024148 |  Ricardo out to the edge of his penalty area and Ricardo has the ball in both hands and we played 19 frantic minutes
[1446.04 - 1449.94] P:1479.23 E:0.024952 |  Has been frantic. It's been good from England's point of view. They've set the stall out very well
[1450.24 - 1454.40] P:1627.37 E:0.029726 |  Oh, what was Gary Neville thinking off? I think he slipped there just trying to head it forward
[1454.40 - 1460.36] P:1730.33 E:0.026964 |  But slipped in the right back area has conceded a corner which figure will take and once more
[1460.60 - 1464.72] P:1711.28 E:0.025726 |  I don't like this tactic everything on player back defending it's played short though to Deco
[1464.72 - 1467.44] P:1684.46 E:0.030745 |  Deco dinks the cross towards the far post costiniers there
[1467.44 - 1470.96] P:1663.90 E:0.025771 |  But he can't guide the header back into the danger area which behind for a goal
[1470.96 - 1475.68] P:1421.02 E:0.028524 |  Yeah, he's just a bit uncertain about that and just a little bit worried that saying then haven't picked the players up as
[1475.68 - 1480.20] P:1467.14 E:0.026378 |  Enough in the bodies back there to pick up the Portuguese who don't generally put a lot of men into the box
[1480.28 - 1485.72] P:1775.86 E:0.028339 |  But but Christina came around the back Deco tried to think the ball from left to right with a little diagonal
[1485.76 - 1488.76] P:1877.62 E:0.026587 |  The focus to you, but he couldn't got his head back across the box
[1488.76 - 1492.56] P:1698.93 E:0.025425 |  But that's four corners that England have conceded that's been a bit sloppy on that occasion
[1492.56 - 1495.16] P:1405.79 E:0.024152 |  But they're defending I would say has been better on set pieces
[1495.16 - 1500.14] P:1393.09 E:0.022647 |  But you know if they're gonna consider a lot then you know time might time may tell and they still need one nil
[1500.14 - 1504.84] P:1620.89 E:0.028670 |  Oh and heads the ball out to the right side Graham tether coming on in a moment to give us his thoughts
[1505.28 - 1506.52] P:1732.25 E:0.027508 |  Rooney
[1506.52 - 1510.32] P:1714.76 E:0.031731 |  Crosses and it hits none of the land he's left foot and that's behind for an England corner
[1510.32 - 1513.24] P:1523.72 E:0.030318 |  There's a good pace to the game as well and England you know they won the lap
[1513.24 - 1518.24] P:1642.32 E:0.028006 |  Haven't got to go and chase it what you don't want to see is England drop deep but they did against France and against other teams as well
[1518.24 - 1521.28] P:1714.31 E:0.031448 |  When they have been one they're up they've got to keep and pass the ball very well
[1521.28 - 1524.56] P:1842.44 E:0.032967 |  We're talking they're doing and they're finding out in superlative form tonight
[1524.56 - 1527.76] P:1835.01 E:0.033083 |  And they'll look they've also got the threat of Rooney who's been close once or twice as well
[1529.12 - 1534.12] P:1927.42 E:0.027474 |  David Beckham to take the corner from the right-hand side we played 20 and a half minutes
[1534.12 - 1540.36] P:1863.59 E:0.027510 |  You're listening to five line on the BBC sport on five taken short to Gary Neville edge of the penalty Neville dinks in across
[1540.48 - 1542.48] P:1594.13 E:0.034990 |  Campbell's there
[1544.00 - 1549.48] P:1608.07 E:0.030566 |  Yeah, but a bit of improvisation from England's point of view the left one-on-one at the back of English deco against Ashley Cole
[1549.48 - 1554.04] P:1565.52 E:0.027423 |  Very brave from England's point of view Gary Neville came late Beckham laid it into him took a touch Gary Neville
[1554.04 - 1560.64] P:1581.83 E:0.026635 |  Dinked it into the box and there was Campbell coming in about eight yards out a free header virtually under pressure a little bit from a
[1560.64 - 1566.16] P:1608.14 E:0.031875 |  Portuguese defender, but he put his header over the ball. That was a good chance Graham. Yeah, well, this is an end-to-end game
[1566.20 - 1568.72] P:1702.96 E:0.031713 |  It's been like that for the first 20 minutes
[1568.88 - 1574.24] P:1693.75 E:0.030440 |  Neither team has settled and dominated the roles of Gerard and Costini are very interesting
[1574.24 - 1576.24] P:1571.76 E:0.030966 |  Because they're looking for the players in the home
[1576.24 - 1581.40] P:1668.07 E:0.027924 |  But I have to say since his mistake Costini has looked very unsettled Rooney's after the ball
[1581.72 - 1588.72] P:1671.26 E:0.028019 |  Right side of the Portuguese penalty here, and then he played off on Friday and what's the complaint here a foul by Rooney?
[1589.28 - 1591.28] P:1712.70 E:0.027726 |  Not sure about that at all Graham
[1592.28 - 1594.28] P:1853.82 E:0.035398 |  Anyway, I don't know what
[1594.60 - 1601.80] P:1855.02 E:0.030239 |  Where does it say in the rulebook that you get penalized for losing your foot? Is that it? Oh that I mean that's clearly breaking the law
[1602.96 - 1608.96] P:1657.88 E:0.025764 |  And we left it is boot and clattered it into the face of Andrade while I would understand what boots what what boots does
[1609.56 - 1612.00] P:1727.12 E:0.027169 |  When Rooney, well, I think it's Nike boots
[1613.24 - 1615.24] P:1669.88 E:0.029381 |  Perhaps my has got to deal with Nike
[1616.24 - 1620.52] P:1727.95 E:0.021434 |  Okay, I'm well after say that no, but you did it as usual
[1621.04 - 1627.76] P:1807.48 E:0.030719 |  Ronaldo to Miguel skull slips Miguel up to the edge of the penalty are cuts inside and that wasn't that clever
[1627.76 - 1634.08] P:1687.99 E:0.024382 |  Is he ran straight into Ashley Cole who clears it to Michael on on the far side Owen back to Cole and
[1635.08 - 1642.68] P:1716.95 E:0.025406 |  Cole's clearance that not an effective one collected by Deco Deco to the right and Miguel first time cross by Miguel
[1642.92 - 1648.80] P:1710.44 E:0.026795 |  Terry jump didn't connect with his head and it's lifted away to safety by Gary Neville over the halfway line
[1648.92 - 1653.76] P:1616.96 E:0.020311 |  We've played 22 and a half minutes Michael Rooney struggling
[1654.24 - 1657.48] P:1702.29 E:0.025186 |  Wayne Rooney struggling always sitting down now Michael
[1658.20 - 1661.28] P:1765.62 E:0.027853 |  Well, I hope it's just that he can't get his boot back on again
[1661.28 - 1665.12] P:1827.77 E:0.029980 |  But anyway, we'll just watch what happens at the moment Rooney sitting down and
[1666.44 - 1669.96] P:1730.01 E:0.031485 |  Gary Lewin is waiting to come on so Wayne Rooney's got a problem
[1670.24 - 1678.12] P:1770.88 E:0.029521 |  England have the ball and they need to give get that David Beckham santa lampard get the ball out of play so that Rooney can receive attention well
[1679.16 - 1681.16] P:1889.09 E:0.024826 |  After all the headlines
[1681.20 - 1684.80] P:1801.36 E:0.025793 |  Let's hope this isn't an injury headline now around Wayne Rooney
[1685.48 - 1690.64] P:1870.62 E:0.032245 |  He's back up on his feet again and the referee is my is saying that he's gonna have to leave the pitch to receive attention
[1690.64 - 1692.68] P:2012.75 E:0.033180 |  It's his right leg and he's hobbling off Terry
[1692.68 - 1698.60] P:1931.17 E:0.032117 |  What do you think I don't know if that came when the challenge when he lost his boot in the Portuguese penalty area whether he was stood on
[1699.04 - 1703.40] P:1463.26 E:0.025680 |  The Portuguese defender stood on his foot. I mean, I mean, he's obviously accidental when his boot came off
[1703.40 - 1706.20] P:1703.97 E:0.024205 |  But he's just receiving treatment there. I wonder if it's a
[1707.88 - 1711.00] P:1640.06 E:0.028324 |  Saunas to his foot that he just needs a little bit of treatment
[1711.00 - 1715.56] P:1674.74 E:0.027383 |  Right spending your now it's showing a bit of a concern and he's just gone forward and spoken to
[1716.32 - 1719.64] P:1562.74 E:0.031881 |  Rooney and the physio England at the moment down to 10 men
[1720.16 - 1725.30] P:1614.96 E:0.032438 |  England leading by one goal to know you're listening to five live Michael Owen getting it inside the first three minutes
[1725.34 - 1732.02] P:1707.13 E:0.030477 |  He told us in an interview yesterday that he thought he was getting better in the tournament and inevitably he scored his first goal
[1732.02 - 1733.54] P:1962.17 E:0.023998 |  but now there's
[1733.54 - 1738.98] P:1788.14 E:0.032194 |  Concern about Wayne Rooney. He's off the pitch Ronaldo's got the ball can Portugal take advantage here
[1739.26 - 1745.06] P:1650.05 E:0.034343 |  Ronaldo turning around Ashley Cole edge of the area gives the ball back to Figo Ronaldo's gone down following the challenge
[1745.26 - 1747.26] P:1761.79 E:0.034172 |  Figo lays it forward looking for Deco
[1747.38 - 1751.30] P:1573.46 E:0.034497 |  Deco's gonna try and pull this one back pulls it back headed away well by John Terry
[1751.34 - 1756.42] P:1578.19 E:0.031699 |  Rooney's gonna come back into the game and you'll get a great ovation from the England fans as soon as they see it back on
[1756.42 - 1763.18] P:1634.96 E:0.035096 |  The pitch in the meantime lampard loses the ball over on the far side takes an effliction James has dropped it and then gets it second time round
[1763.98 - 1767.34] P:1650.69 E:0.032003 |  It's a very open game too open really from England's point of view
[1768.14 - 1771.18] P:1717.73 E:0.032088 |  They're trying to attract the referee's attention now so that Rooney
[1771.70 - 1777.22] P:1713.45 E:0.029915 |  Can come back into this quarterfinal here comes Wayne Rooney England with 11 men back on the field
[1777.22 - 1780.06] P:1582.16 E:0.033196 |  He's not running well though Wayne Rooney and he's gonna have to
[1780.50 - 1787.50] P:1687.57 E:0.032330 |  Maybe leave this game here come Portugal Luis Figo edge of the penalty area tackled by Skoles Figo gets it back again
[1787.70 - 1792.78] P:1695.03 E:0.033640 |  Drama surrounding Wayne Rooney Rooney at the moment watching the ball in the air headed wide
[1793.38 - 1797.66] P:1656.33 E:0.032042 |  By Portugal doesn't look good about Rooney here Terry doesn't look good at all
[1797.66 - 1801.66] P:1601.81 E:0.033372 |  No, no Gomez heading the ball wide there bit of a half chance for Portugal good cross
[1801.82 - 1805.86] P:1651.12 E:0.032796 |  But in the Valencia on the left hand side really struggling he's struggling he's limping
[1806.86 - 1809.74] P:1625.08 E:0.034854 |  Just about on the on the halfway line towards the center circle
[1810.22 - 1812.58] P:1623.27 E:0.030590 |  I think he's similar to the Benish to say well hang on a minute
[1812.58 - 1818.18] P:1549.19 E:0.029823 |  This is not this is not right and the Spenny or Harrison talking to Gary Loon talking to the physios Ray Clemens is out there as well
[1818.18 - 1822.58] P:1561.72 E:0.025961 |  I think they're just gonna give him five minutes to see what he can do if it's right or not
[1823.14 - 1829.10] P:1701.24 E:0.028790 |  So much of his game of course is about blistering pace, but at the moment he's virtually a passenger and of course
[1830.38 - 1832.38] P:1586.70 E:0.028570 |  Thinking ahead if England can get to the semi-final
[1832.46 - 1838.78] P:1604.92 E:0.030286 |  That's in six days time, but they will not want to take any risk now with the player of their tournament so far Wayne Rooney
[1839.26 - 1842.54] P:1698.07 E:0.030022 |  We may have to have Heskey or Vasello on soon for Rooney
[1842.54 - 1846.14] P:1666.21 E:0.030142 |  Who's just been given two or three minutes to see whether he can run off the injury?
[1846.70 - 1851.74] P:1600.91 E:0.030264 |  Daria Darius Vasello will be the replacement we think in just a moment for Wayne Rooney
[1852.66 - 1855.42] P:1792.66 E:0.036347 |  for goals in the last two games
[1856.42 - 1862.74] P:1954.00 E:0.037791 |  Portugal have detailed a player to look after Wayne Rooney, but it looks like this quarter final is only gonna last 26 minutes
[1863.22 - 1867.30] P:1929.38 E:0.035649 |  Rooney will be replaced by Darius Vasello of Aston Villa
[1868.26 - 1873.62] P:1835.06 E:0.031642 |  But not yet the fourth officials not and I don't kind of understand why the change couldn't have been made then
[1874.22 - 1876.82] P:1873.86 E:0.031633 |  How much of a disruption is this going to be for England Terry?
[1876.82 - 1882.78] P:1784.80 E:0.030550 |  He can't get them on yet because the fourth official is telling the tucky shirt in are you sure he's having a laugh that fourth official
[1883.54 - 1886.06] P:1691.24 E:0.031058 |  Rooney can't even challenge for that long ball and
[1886.74 - 1890.06] P:1554.90 E:0.034378 |  Portugal now in central midfield whistles gone for handball and
[1890.58 - 1896.54] P:1768.52 E:0.028901 |  Now just tell us how much you think this is going to affect England Rooney coming off to be replaced by Vasello
[1896.66 - 1900.82] P:1665.89 E:0.033708 |  Well, Michael Owen just going over to get a drink as well might get some instructions from Steve McClann
[1900.82 - 1903.34] P:1813.53 E:0.035339 |  I think it is it's obviously a blow from England's point of view
[1903.34 - 1905.58] P:1767.22 E:0.033774 |  But Vasello is a good sub to have to come on now
[1905.58 - 1908.66] P:1772.71 E:0.034266 |  He normally comes on for 20 minutes or about 15 minutes towards the end of the match
[1908.82 - 1913.94] P:1855.93 E:0.033740 |  He's obviously a striker. He's done well in the championship so far. He's done well for England and he's in the career
[1914.46 - 1916.46] P:1798.34 E:0.030152 |  but he's you know, it's it's it's a
[1916.62 - 1920.50] P:1714.24 E:0.029765 |  It's a challenge for him as a challenge from Michael Owen up front to forge a new partnership
[1920.50 - 1924.30] P:1469.27 E:0.030376 |  It's not what England wanted but they won them up and Vasello is a good man to come on
[1924.66 - 1929.90] P:1650.12 E:0.031016 |  Symbolically, of course, it's a big loss because everything has been revolving around Rooney England have had so much confidence
[1930.54 - 1935.90] P:1684.20 E:0.029647 |  As a result of his form the cell tries to make a challenge on Cavalio Cavalio clears
[1936.06 - 1941.62] P:1661.26 E:0.029148 |  Nuno Gomez all in his own soul Campbell hits it back to David James. What do you think he's done Wayne Rooney?
[1941.62 - 1943.74] P:1675.89 E:0.032920 |  What do you think the injury is? I think what his boot came off?
[1943.74 - 1947.10] P:1568.85 E:0.028610 |  I'm not too sure if the defender andrade stood on his foot. He may have just done that
[1947.10 - 1949.62] P:1437.03 E:0.027182 |  But look there's oh when the when the boot came off
[1950.26 - 1953.14] P:1558.01 E:0.034188 |  Obviously the referee pulled him back but then he couldn't carry on after that
[1953.14 - 1956.54] P:1652.52 E:0.030487 |  So you may have had a maybe my been stood on England must get on with it
[1956.54 - 1961.78] P:1686.13 E:0.034550 |  They must concentrate as Deco the Portuguese danger man looks to filter the ball through to Ronaldo Ashley goal doesn't clear
[1961.86 - 1966.10] P:1680.84 E:0.029512 |  But then it comes back luckily to David James in the England goal away to our left
[1966.10 - 1972.30] P:1685.40 E:0.026981 |  You're listening to five live England getting off to a fly here through Michael Owen scoring inside the first three minutes
[1972.30 - 1981.58] P:1739.65 E:0.028559 |  It's 26 international goal. He's now level with Brian Robson 26 goals for England next in line with 27 is David Platt
[1982.38 - 1987.90] P:1684.69 E:0.032533 |  England give the ball away a little easily. It's Figo now for Portugal side stepping Gary Neville
[1987.90 - 1995.10] P:1644.83 E:0.032438 |  He's got Valente down this near side the field Figo going forward lays it into Ronaldo Ronaldo shot and it's blocked by soul Campbell
[1995.10 - 2000.18] P:1643.43 E:0.033814 |  Oh in his back inside his own half and of course a feature of England's play with Rooney as Ronaldo goes forward now
[2000.50 - 2002.50] P:1698.69 E:0.039612 |  And he's brought down on the edge of the area
[2003.10 - 2009.54] P:1804.23 E:0.035471 |  Precisely the sort of thing that England have got to avoid in these games against sides like Portugal with their set pieces
[2009.54 - 2014.54] P:1717.55 E:0.033615 |  Of course a feature of Rooney's play is he's been dropping deep and helping out the midfield players as well
[2014.54 - 2019.62] P:1598.91 E:0.031794 |  And now Michael Owen is going to have to do that. I'd say what a dive that was what an absolute dive
[2019.62 - 2022.38] P:1485.30 E:0.033080 |  That was on the edge of the box is a con man and I'll do a net case
[2022.38 - 2026.42] P:1651.08 E:0.031025 |  It is con the referee is given the free kick danger for England here real danger
[2027.18 - 2031.10] P:1728.94 E:0.033959 |  Louis Figo who got Portugal back into the game against England four years ago
[2031.94 - 2038.10] P:1717.60 E:0.032223 |  He's announced his retirement of course from international football in Portugal don't win tonight. This will be his last game
[2038.14 - 2040.64] P:1647.08 E:0.031123 |  Here he is in Lisbon edge of the penalty area
[2040.74 - 2045.62] P:1735.05 E:0.030899 |  David James is ready England have conceded a free kick Louis Figo over the bar
[2046.34 - 2047.74] P:1670.25 E:0.033468 |  And the goal kick for England
[2047.74 - 2052.50] P:1719.98 E:0.031466 |  I'll have it with that because the wall stood strong a stood tall Figo came up to it and shaped
[2052.74 - 2055.42] P:1555.60 E:0.026854 |  Perhaps on the wrong side if anything for Figo
[2055.42 - 2061.10] P:1536.67 E:0.029096 |  But the referee's got to be stronger when it comes to an elder because he pushed the ball past Ashley Cole and then just
[2061.10 - 2064.74] P:1650.74 E:0.030047 |  Clattered into him. He knew he wasn't gonna get the ball the other side the referee gave the free kick
[2065.10 - 2068.82] P:1638.22 E:0.030002 |  There's a slight reversal in the roles now for cell is the one that's pushed further forward
[2068.82 - 2071.66] P:1484.94 E:0.033830 |  I think Michael Owen is doing that really role and just coming off
[2072.34 - 2074.74] P:1707.17 E:0.033621 |  Ball headed on by the cell looking for Michael Owen
[2075.30 - 2077.30] P:1877.26 E:0.035080 |  Took it early and Ricardo
[2077.86 - 2085.34] P:1789.62 E:0.033494 |  Makes the save and produces a corner fantastic right footer there from Michael Owen with real sting and Ricardo can seize a corner kick
[2085.34 - 2090.62] P:1762.80 E:0.032259 |  It was a good save as well Ricardo the left-hand side that was going just inside the post the cell flicked it on
[2090.62 - 2094.14] P:1809.58 E:0.031386 |  Owen was the one that went for the other side good save from Ricardo
[2094.94 - 2097.46] P:1919.93 E:0.026642 |  David Beckham replaces a couple of divots
[2097.86 - 2102.50] P:1883.35 E:0.028398 |  Down by the corner flag near side the field the England right to corner kick to England
[2102.50 - 2106.58] P:1717.30 E:0.033333 |  There's a short corner to lampard lampard lifts it into the far post with too much pace
[2106.62 - 2109.30] P:1641.78 E:0.032292 |  Terry might get that over on the far side by the corner flag
[2109.30 - 2111.46] P:1684.81 E:0.029362 |  But all he's done is set it up for the fullback Miguel
[2111.62 - 2116.78] P:1732.42 E:0.027952 |  Skulls now picks up the loose ball for England far side the left turn back well by Campbell to Ashley Cole
[2116.78 - 2122.26] P:1748.88 E:0.029584 |  Who's been having an outstanding tournament Skulls gets the ball away and now tries to recover it and then fouls
[2122.66 - 2125.46] P:1779.04 E:0.026022 |  The Portuguese player Figo in the process
[2126.10 - 2130.94] P:1626.35 E:0.031294 |  England leading by one goal to nil free kick to Portugal here comes a danger man now from Portugal Deco
[2130.94 - 2137.30] P:1747.24 E:0.030521 |  Cross comes Gary Neville and Steven Gerrard who's playing very deep players long for England looking for the pace of derisive cell
[2137.30 - 2139.68] P:1560.98 E:0.030684 |  The cell lets it bounce a couple of times and then try they
[2140.30 - 2143.40] P:1600.11 E:0.035400 |  I thought climbed all over him at the free kick has been given
[2144.70 - 2147.46] P:1810.53 E:0.031076 |  mystifyingly to Portugal in the left back position
[2147.46 - 2149.46] P:1842.35 E:0.025511 |  I'm a little I mean like
[2150.06 - 2154.94] P:1619.45 E:0.029802 |  Soldiers stood there and grand is all over him the referee gives the free kick against myself just for standing there
[2155.18 - 2156.58] P:1356.07 E:0.017349 |  don't have political
[2156.58 - 2160.82] P:1609.77 E:0.027927 |  In just ten days Wayne Rooney has become an icon here with England
[2160.94 - 2163.88] P:1661.59 E:0.031614 |  But England are gonna have to win this quarterfinal now without him
[2163.88 - 2167.82] P:1625.69 E:0.030400 |  We played half an hour of the game still an hour to go here in Lisbon where
[2168.26 - 2174.10] P:1617.43 E:0.032216 |  Portugal haven't lost a game for 17 years Portugal have the ball far side the field laid forward Paul Markey by England
[2174.10 - 2179.38] P:1631.42 E:0.035425 |  No no Gomez unmarked on the edge of the area now Ronaldo, but it's taken away from him at the last minute by David Beckham
[2179.94 - 2185.66] P:1663.31 E:0.030574 |  Beckham all he can do is knock it straight back to Portugal and England are being stretched at times and Rade the defender
[2185.82 - 2190.86] P:1630.14 E:0.028616 |  Onto costiña who's now not having to mark Wayne Rooney anymore Figo in the center circle
[2191.50 - 2197.38] P:1698.83 E:0.031666 |  Portugal building slowly from the back and again Deco has too much room in midfield the ball breaks to Nuno Gomez
[2197.50 - 2205.02] P:1668.94 E:0.030487 |  Back again to Figo Figo lifts the ball forward headed sideways by Deco and cleared by Seoul Campbell England leading 1-0
[2205.02 - 2208.94] P:1745.58 E:0.032314 |  The sellers come on for Rooney England at the moment had just lost it a little bit in midfield
[2208.94 - 2211.26] P:1445.82 E:0.029834 |  They haven't got a great control on the game at the moment
[2211.26 - 2215.86] P:1566.24 E:0.030508 |  But Michael Owen a fantastic effort just two or three minutes ago Portugal building again left-hand side
[2216.14 - 2221.90] P:1620.56 E:0.029477 |  David Beckham's there in the right back position Beckham down the line trying to play it into Vercel and Rade's there and
[2222.30 - 2228.38] P:1701.91 E:0.028396 |  Andrade clears now Nuno Valente the left back costiña all porto there because now
[2228.54 - 2234.42] P:1725.22 E:0.033268 |  Deco's got it and the crowd emerging in forward Deco the danger man the Brazilian born player shoots wide and here
[2234.70 - 2237.10] P:1817.29 E:0.029206 |  After 32 minutes is Graham Taylor
[2237.38 - 2240.38] P:1834.79 E:0.034096 |  What an open game this is although in the last few minutes
[2240.90 - 2244.42] P:1628.71 E:0.030956 |  Portugal have certainly had much more possession and are looking dangerous
[2244.42 - 2247.70] P:1593.27 E:0.030150 |  But what I think what I'd like to say in the opening half hour
[2247.70 - 2252.18] P:1600.75 E:0.030866 |  I don't think you could have asked for a better performance from a frontman than Michael Owen
[2252.18 - 2257.02] P:1878.51 E:0.032351 |  Not only has he scored the goals, but he's come short. He's looked wide behind the full backs
[2257.02 - 2259.02] P:1858.31 E:0.031244 |  He's worked hard when out of possession
[2259.02 - 2263.74] P:1760.18 E:0.030802 |  He really has had an absolutely first-class opening half hour to this game
[2264.42 - 2268.46] P:1668.47 E:0.027391 |  Thank you Graham that Michael Owens had to change his role now in this game it to a certain extent
[2268.46 - 2272.78] P:1598.21 E:0.026316 |  He's not able to play off the last defender anymore Vercel's got that job with his pace
[2272.78 - 2274.78] P:1709.76 E:0.022082 |  Owen's having to tuck in behind him having
[2275.42 - 2280.50] P:1773.40 E:0.025890 |  Lost Rooney in this game after 26 minutes, but England have the lead by one goal to nil
[2280.50 - 2284.98] P:1696.81 E:0.029922 |  They were always likely to score in this game the question mark was of course could they control midfield?
[2285.02 - 2290.22] P:1696.51 E:0.028708 |  Could they get it right at the back? Owen very deep for him on to Gerard Gerard gets it away look
[2290.66 - 2294.42] P:1782.43 E:0.033299 |  Didn't really look to see where the cell was goals comes in with a sliding challenge
[2294.42 - 2297.06] P:1768.13 E:0.031687 |  And Owen again is tucking in in midfield to help out
[2297.38 - 2302.42] P:1693.88 E:0.029955 |  Gary Neville slides it to Ashley Cole down the England left and England now need a little bit of possession on the ball
[2302.58 - 2307.70] P:1634.42 E:0.029272 |  Played forward long by Lampard Cavalos there up against a rise for cell the cell may get this
[2307.70 - 2314.50] P:1640.94 E:0.027510 |  It's bouncing awkwardly for him the Aston Villa man is there still derives for cell and the end Portugal get a clearance Miguel up against
[2314.50 - 2317.38] P:1706.90 E:0.030733 |  Skulls goals tigerishly comes in but can't get the ball
[2318.14 - 2324.30] P:1712.73 E:0.028798 |  Portugal now setting up a counter attack for them until Deco gives it away Lampard's there and now it's
[2324.78 - 2330.22] P:1814.99 E:0.030790 |  Steven Gerard and Gerard turns and Gerard approaches the half wayline Michael Owen to his right
[2330.58 - 2336.50] P:1680.22 E:0.030155 |  The cell to the left. It's a great ball to the fullback Gary Neville now David Beckett chips it forward looking for Gary Neville
[2336.50 - 2338.54] P:1596.85 E:0.030754 |  Gary Neville should get this by the corner flag
[2338.54 - 2345.38] P:1684.32 E:0.031470 |  What's the cross line and it goes flicked header from Michael Owen and it's taken a deflection off the defender and England responding well here
[2345.86 - 2350.10] P:1679.21 E:0.030270 |  They have a corner over on the far side the left Michael Owen's like a magnet for the ball
[2350.10 - 2353.22] P:1533.67 E:0.032115 |  Whatever the whenever the ball comes into the box or whatever the balls play forward
[2353.22 - 2355.54] P:1557.62 E:0.031201 |  It goes straight to Michael Owen and Grains exactly right
[2355.54 - 2359.26] P:1648.04 E:0.031920 |  He's leading this line by example by work right by touch by vision
[2359.66 - 2364.22] P:1647.88 E:0.031060 |  He's having a fantastic match and even then Gary Neville going down the right hand side crossed the ball to the near post
[2364.22 - 2366.86] P:1709.84 E:0.033023 |  Who is making the run? It was Michael Owen good glancing header
[2366.86 - 2370.34] P:1719.64 E:0.031799 |  I think it hit Cavalaro went over the ball went over the bar
[2370.66 - 2375.82] P:1873.77 E:0.030979 |  Brignan's fifth corner the England are to advance in this tournament. They must hope that Rooney has bruising only
[2376.38 - 2382.54] P:1779.48 E:0.029017 |  Nothing broken with the foot here comes an in swinging corner from David Beckham and that's headed away and over
[2383.10 - 2387.34] P:1657.15 E:0.026690 |  Comfortably wide by Derias Vassal and it's going to be a goal kick for Ricardo
[2387.34 - 2392.94] P:1586.42 E:0.025872 |  This is five live in England ten minutes away from halftime lead one nil. It's amazing that Vassal actually wins the header
[2392.94 - 2394.70] P:1556.06 E:0.022991 |  It does come off the defender
[2394.70 - 2398.66] P:1411.29 E:0.029793 |  Comes off Cavalaro I think or Valenti for the for a corner the referee doesn't give it
[2398.70 - 2402.38] P:1469.44 E:0.028717 |  It's amazing that for selling Owen I wouldn't head us in the box when they've got big center halves
[2402.38 - 2408.34] P:1600.01 E:0.027206 |  What's a name he could make for himself tonight derisive cell having come on earlier than he would have anticipated for Wayne Rooney
[2408.46 - 2410.86] P:1478.11 E:0.027579 |  He was always likely to play a part in the second half
[2411.18 - 2418.66] P:1622.04 E:0.026080 |  Now soul Campbell to John Terry and Terry just smashes the ball rather aimlessly back into the Portugal half England need better build up than that from
[2418.66 - 2424.22] P:1619.17 E:0.024738 |  The back it's andrade the former Porto player now with de Portivo la Carunier in Spain
[2425.06 - 2431.74] P:1701.13 E:0.028420 |  Costinia the man of course who scored a villa park against England and also scored late on to deny Manchester United in the Champions League
[2431.90 - 2436.74] P:1714.07 E:0.029004 |  Skulls and he's lost out and it's Deco now for Portugal winning a corner kick. It's end-to-end
[2437.46 - 2439.22] P:1828.82 E:0.028832 |  Portugal have a corner
[2439.22 - 2440.74] P:1758.34 E:0.026280 |  far side the right
[2440.74 - 2442.74] P:1771.21 E:0.026019 |  Figo to take it and
[2443.26 - 2452.10] P:1726.58 E:0.029378 |  Cavalio and andrade the two centre backs both go forward and these are more testing moments for David James and his defenders
[2452.74 - 2457.66] P:1729.83 E:0.031160 |  Corner kick to Portugal far side the right and it goes and it's headed away and wide
[2458.54 - 2463.10] P:1685.18 E:0.027099 |  Even wider than the cells effort that was costinia and that's a goal kick to David James
[2463.10 - 2467.98] P:1659.99 E:0.035045 |  Yeah, but boss is worrying for Portugal that myself wins headers from corners is also worrying that Christina
[2468.02 - 2473.10] P:1916.98 E:0.035444 |  Will wings headers from corners as well and because Terry and lampard that were going towards the ball
[2473.10 - 2475.30] P:1828.08 E:0.033966 |  And Christine had the free head up from about ten yards
[2475.30 - 2478.62] P:1854.06 E:0.030197 |  But they're never gonna get it on target for England go have to defend better
[2478.66 - 2483.22] P:1659.73 E:0.028754 |  It says one of those ones are you not waiting for Portugal to score you're gonna try and get the ball and keep it
[2483.22 - 2488.90] P:1522.12 E:0.031196 |  But it's difficult to build it up from the back because both England's full backs are plugged now here come Portugal once more through Deco Deco
[2489.62 - 2491.62] P:1779.55 E:0.037428 |  tackle from behind
[2492.74 - 2494.74] P:1857.00 E:0.039197 |  Stephen Gerard gets a yellow card
[2495.58 - 2502.06] P:1689.75 E:0.033363 |  referee Ersmire shows a yellow card to perhaps England's most important player Stephen Gerard that's his first of the tournament
[2502.58 - 2505.34] P:1663.00 E:0.030340 |  but Gerard now is on a yellow card in this game and
[2506.34 - 2511.02] P:1662.77 E:0.030225 |  Portugal have a free kick at least 30 yards away from David James's goal we have
[2511.66 - 2513.98] P:1623.44 E:0.026997 |  played 37 minutes of
[2514.46 - 2517.70] P:1643.99 E:0.031232 |  The very entertaining perhaps to entertaining first half from Sven
[2517.82 - 2521.02] P:1905.06 E:0.031192 |  You're an Ericsson's point of view England in front in the first three minutes
[2521.06 - 2525.44] P:1969.75 E:0.030710 |  They have lost Wayne Rooney through an injury the cell has come on
[2525.94 - 2530.74] P:1718.06 E:0.026604 |  Deco man of the match against Spain man of the match in the Champions League final for Porto
[2530.86 - 2534.78] P:1784.68 E:0.025775 |  He's got Maniche to the right and Deco now hands-on hips
[2535.30 - 2541.14] P:1738.82 E:0.031339 |  Prepares to lash this one towards David James guard. It's dreadful. It's into the crowd for a goal kick
[2542.26 - 2546.16] P:1643.95 E:0.029251 |  Yeah, it was Figo that took the van Nisteloi roll just in front of David James
[2546.66 - 2552.30] P:1401.32 E:0.028401 |  About four or five yards offside but came back on but the free kick was never gonna trouble David James miles over the bar. Thankfully
[2552.98 - 2558.02] P:1580.36 E:0.030435 |  Well now Gerard of course has to be careful on a yellow card in this game and England give it away again
[2558.06 - 2561.82] P:1558.22 E:0.029118 |  Too simply Deco's on the ball looks for Miguel down the right-hand side
[2562.02 - 2566.82] P:1633.45 E:0.028381 |  It's out of playing them as trying get to half time here with this one-nil lead
[2567.54 - 2569.06] P:1605.53 E:0.018420 |  Both of these
[2569.06 - 2572.10] P:1600.76 E:0.025433 |  countries of course coached by an overseas coach
[2572.62 - 2579.10] P:1574.52 E:0.026885 |  No team has ever won a European Championship with an overseas coach Scolaria of Portugal Ericsson of England and Ericsson's England
[2579.10 - 2583.10] P:1652.84 E:0.025678 |  Are just in front here through Michael Owens goal inside the first three minutes
[2583.46 - 2586.66] P:1606.86 E:0.027198 |  Portugal have had good possession as Maniche finds Figo
[2587.46 - 2593.10] P:1497.47 E:0.032881 |  With two or three England players around him finds Miguel down the right-hand side and that's a poor delivery from him and
[2593.34 - 2595.14] P:1585.21 E:0.032875 |  England will hope for more of the same
[2595.14 - 2599.08] P:1790.32 E:0.028221 |  Never goal kick for David James away to our left. We've got
[2599.82 - 2601.86] P:1599.71 E:0.025929 |  About seven minutes left of the first half
[2601.86 - 2606.10] P:1436.36 E:0.029719 |  I'm not that concerned when the ball goes out to the wide players because the full backs are doing an excellent job
[2606.10 - 2609.50] P:1514.32 E:0.027530 |  And midfield players are coming back to screen defenders are picking up well in the box
[2609.62 - 2613.98] P:1495.09 E:0.031331 |  So I think from that point of view even to doing very well and remember Scolari was a manager for Brazil
[2614.50 - 2619.42] P:1415.72 E:0.033198 |  Brazil were one-nil down in the one-nil up courtesy of a Michael Owen goal in the quarter finals of the World Cup
[2619.66 - 2624.26] P:1542.59 E:0.031502 |  And a bit of magic from the Brazilians got themselves back into the game at this moment in time
[2624.78 - 2628.82] P:1483.29 E:0.035557 |  I'm doing a good job defensively and not keeping the ball as well as Ericsson would like I think
[2628.98 - 2635.82] P:1625.73 E:0.034625 |  Brazil got back into the game crucially just before half time. Here's Michael Owen by the corner flag near side of the field winning a throw in against a
[2637.46 - 2642.42] P:1686.84 E:0.030117 |  Calvary, oh, it's the throw to England and they're taking their time Gary Neville showing his experience
[2642.66 - 2649.70] P:1746.61 E:0.027847 |  Paul Scoles the Salon. Oh, you know the three England players in the area Gerard and Lampard lurking Gary Neville looks like he's gonna try and
[2650.34 - 2656.38] P:1764.83 E:0.028485 |  Find some distance with this throwing David Beckham at the moment by the near post one-nil to England in goes a throw in towards Beckham
[2656.38 - 2660.90] P:1734.45 E:0.029645 |  And it's well caught by Ricardo and he clears quickly and Terry is there before
[2661.50 - 2667.08] P:1580.74 E:0.024269 |  Nuno Gomez can threaten Gerard heads the ball back to Campbell and Campbell Campbell looks at the back past
[2667.40 - 2670.16] P:1787.94 E:0.026512 |  James there and that's a reasonable clearance by James
[2670.16 - 2675.64] P:1576.84 E:0.024880 |  It goes a long way in the air when it comes down both players miss it the cell now up against and Rade and
[2676.12 - 2682.32] P:1563.35 E:0.030843 |  Ball played forward looking for Lampard across comes Kavayo who's quick at the back the Porto man and Kavayo clears
[2682.32 - 2687.44] P:1642.54 E:0.027864 |  Figo can't take it and Terry will knock it sideways to Gary Neville who again shows his experience
[2688.16 - 2696.08] P:1812.00 E:0.028830 |  Finding James James to Scoles beautiful layoff from Scoles to Ashley Cole Michael Owen trying to stay on site Cole up against
[2696.20 - 2701.08] P:1670.65 E:0.035186 |  Costinia but he's lost the ball to Miguel and now he's out of position as Portugal come on the counterattack
[2701.08 - 2707.52] P:1669.26 E:0.032557 |  Here's the danger man Cristiano Ronaldo as Cole tries to get back Deco to Ronaldo challenge comes in from Campbell
[2707.52 - 2714.20] P:1730.54 E:0.036564 |  It was super and Gerard now may get caught in possession Beckham and Gerard game opening up once more Gerard goes past Kavayo
[2714.24 - 2718.64] P:1701.23 E:0.034887 |  He's got the cell to the right and now into the left still Gerard to Beckham down the right
[2718.64 - 2721.72] P:1586.44 E:0.035036 |  Oh in scoring for it. Oh, but Beckham doesn't get the cross in
[2722.16 - 2728.84] P:1686.22 E:0.034081 |  Peel the handball against her and Rade and again the game opens up now as Portugal take the ball inside the England half
[2728.84 - 2733.00] P:1702.24 E:0.030027 |  And it's with Deco the little midfield man Deco against Frank Lampard
[2733.52 - 2737.52] P:1733.00 E:0.034178 |  The referee has given the free kick against Lampard
[2737.52 - 2741.60] P:1697.89 E:0.031815 |  And this one is even nearer now the England goal 25 yards out
[2741.84 - 2745.12] P:1704.39 E:0.032778 |  Free kick to Portugal in the last five minutes of this first half
[2745.12 - 2748.92] P:1467.34 E:0.028730 |  This is more Figo Terrage on the left-hand side this referees having a nightmare Lampard
[2748.92 - 2753.80] P:1575.24 E:0.031416 |  They never so well Deco pushed the ball Lampard got his body in the way the referee deemed it to be a foul
[2754.24 - 2759.56] P:1642.05 E:0.033526 |  Diabolical decision once again, and you feel sometimes as well when it comes to that quarterfinal in Chisauka
[2759.84 - 2764.88] P:1643.55 E:0.032556 |  There's a bit of Brazilian magic this time it may be something from the referee England need to get a half time in the lead
[2765.12 - 2769.76] P:1701.86 E:0.031891 |  It's going to be Lewis Figo with the free kick. It's a big high one and James gets his hand to it as
[2770.32 - 2774.84] P:1719.66 E:0.029552 |  Miguel came racing in and it'll be a corner down the far side the right-hand side
[2774.84 - 2777.92] P:1620.42 E:0.029402 |  Well, I suppose for the neutral it's all action this quarterfinal
[2778.20 - 2783.88] P:1614.35 E:0.029679 |  But England will need to try and close the game down. They may need people like Hargreaves in the second half
[2783.88 - 2785.88] P:1673.97 E:0.034686 |  They've been forced into one substitution already
[2786.40 - 2792.28] P:1556.18 E:0.032785 |  Bringing on the cell for the injured Rooney corner kick to Portugal well dealt with by Gary Neville
[2792.56 - 2794.56] P:1675.23 E:0.033890 |  Portugal coming back once more with Maniche
[2795.00 - 2801.28] P:1710.98 E:0.031663 |  Maniche now center of the field the cells there good tackle from the cell England need to clear they haven't cleared it back to
[2801.28 - 2803.28] P:1801.41 E:0.037106 |  Maniche Maniche shot chance here
[2803.60 - 2805.44] P:1826.56 E:0.035270 |  Straight at David James
[2805.48 - 2807.96] P:1748.10 E:0.035104 |  Surely a hand ball as well by Portuguese player
[2808.68 - 2811.68] P:1680.09 E:0.028672 |  Earth's Maya has he given the free kick yes, yes, he has
[2812.28 - 2815.84] P:1464.11 E:0.030140 |  One thing he's got last he gets a free get to England the ball came in from a niche
[2816.20 - 2822.84] P:1708.34 E:0.030017 |  It was presented to me nice back into the the center of midfield about 25 26 yards out of the shot here Ronaldo
[2822.84 - 2825.64] P:1606.02 E:0.032016 |  If anything else Ronaldo's a lot of shippers a hamble or not
[2825.64 - 2830.04] P:1779.97 E:0.030957 |  I definitely made contact with his arm ball then squirting through to David James free kick for England
[2830.04 - 2833.64] P:1726.85 E:0.030227 |  No threat of Rooney anymore the cells trying to take over the mantle
[2834.56 - 2840.80] P:1672.40 E:0.031670 |  Filled so effectively by Wayne Rooney in this tournament and England must hope if they get through that the news isn't serious
[2841.20 - 2845.68] P:1629.21 E:0.030635 |  About the young Everton player and now Lampard steps in as Figo is a bit sluggish
[2845.68 - 2851.76] P:1734.20 E:0.034936 |  Then he's brought down by Costinia now that has to be surely if the referee is going to be consistent a yellow card
[2851.76 - 2855.24] P:1749.98 E:0.029677 |  It was virtually the same kind of offense as Steven Gerrard's a few moments ago
[2855.24 - 2858.92] P:1712.32 E:0.027118 |  But there's no yellow card for Costinia and can you tell me why there's a shock now?
[2858.92 - 2863.48] P:1493.07 E:0.030366 |  I can't see real if anything you'd say that Deco is bearing down more towards England golems further forward
[2863.64 - 2866.60] P:1494.24 E:0.025542 |  And he deemed it to be a far worthy of a yellow card
[2866.60 - 2871.20] P:1491.39 E:0.028565 |  But there are the Portuguese players around Lampard, but that was a crunching tackle from Costinia
[2871.20 - 2874.96] P:1636.79 E:0.031379 |  Two minutes plus added time left in his first half as Beckham's waste the free kick
[2875.24 - 2879.92] P:1631.08 E:0.029478 |  He looked for skulls over on the far side. It was very obvious one and England have a throw in and
[2880.88 - 2884.32] P:1736.95 E:0.029449 |  Ashley Cole is sticking to his guns over on the left-hand side
[2885.28 - 2887.28] P:1572.02 E:0.028484 |  doing quite well against
[2887.76 - 2892.56] P:1620.00 E:0.034756 |  Whenever it's Figo or Ronaldo, they're into changing all the time. He's done very well. That's the call. He's having a great game
[2892.60 - 2898.24] P:1766.59 E:0.036095 |  So the all the England back for and the middle field in fact everyone is having a good game so far as a great great team performance
[2899.08 - 2901.34] P:1786.91 E:0.036591 |  England taking their time then the ball is delivered
[2901.48 - 2905.68] P:1742.32 E:0.035569 |  But not accurately enough to the cell the cell now the referee's whistle is going to go again
[2905.68 - 2912.04] P:1733.52 E:0.029708 |  The cells been penalized and Portugal what they cannot take the free kick from there the referee now makes them go
[2912.80 - 2918.96] P:1920.48 E:0.028324 |  Some 15 yards sideways the kick is taken and now it's Maneesh approaching the halfway line
[2919.32 - 2921.88] P:1755.50 E:0.033096 |  Maneesh onto Nuno Gomez fouled by John Terry and
[2923.08 - 2927.80] P:1790.80 E:0.027142 |  They have to be more careful than that doing them. They mustn't just present the Portuguese with these kicks
[2927.80 - 2933.12] P:1671.66 E:0.027865 |  We've got about a minute and 15 seconds plus time to be added on as the balls laid into the England area Terry's here
[2933.12 - 2937.20] P:1751.09 E:0.038143 |  It's a bit far from Terry Ronaldo on the edge of the area another free kick
[2938.20 - 2941.92] P:1784.11 E:0.036656 |  Gary Neville has been shown a yellow card now by Ersmire
[2942.28 - 2946.04] P:1770.52 E:0.035541 |  So Gary Neville and Stephen Gerrard are on yellow cards for the rest of this tournament
[2946.28 - 2950.08] P:1764.82 E:0.028095 |  And here's a free kick right on the edge of the area with
[2950.68 - 2957.96] P:1749.80 E:0.028275 |  55 seconds left of this first half plus time to be added on and this is Portugal's opportunity
[2958.88 - 2964.08] P:1785.20 E:0.031094 |  To get back in the game right on half time and to change the atmosphere in this stadium
[2964.92 - 2968.72] P:1721.86 E:0.035958 |  Figo over the ball Deco is not very far away Ersmire
[2969.60 - 2972.28] P:1837.26 E:0.033480 |  Marches the 10 yards takes the England wall back
[2973.16 - 2978.56] P:1768.94 E:0.028126 |  And Luis Figo and Deco two of the great set-piece players in the world
[2979.04 - 2983.36] P:1700.04 E:0.027179 |  Prepare to get Portugal back into this quarterfinal. This is dangerous for England
[2983.52 - 2989.76] P:1709.96 E:0.033763 |  They conceded yet another free kick on the edge of the area and Figo hits it high wide
[2990.32 - 2992.32] P:1799.73 E:0.028338 |  And not handsome at all
[2992.68 - 2995.08] P:1589.24 E:0.032971 |  That's gone wide and Englander let off though Terry
[2995.08 - 2998.80] P:1505.26 E:0.030103 |  Yeah, once again Ronaldo is just touched and goes down very easy on the edge of the box
[2998.84 - 3002.88] P:1574.47 E:0.028399 |  They've had Portugal about two or three really good free kicks in good positions
[3002.88 - 3008.56] P:1546.31 E:0.030089 |  And I'll take you back to February when it was Paul Leto that scored my free kick in a very similar position against England to equalize
[3008.92 - 3012.76] P:1460.94 E:0.029095 |  Ledley King's opener that you know Palato. He was at a wretched tournament
[3012.76 - 3016.32] P:1427.50 E:0.027323 |  He may have been the man that could have got Portugal back into the match. It's a great suspended
[3016.32 - 3019.72] P:1544.03 E:0.031754 |  It's a great scoreline that it's not been a perfect half for England losing the injured Rooney
[3019.72 - 3025.04] P:1633.14 E:0.030455 |  I'm picking up yellow cards for Gary Neville and Stephen Gerrard ball played forward to hastily there by Lampard and
[3025.28 - 3027.28] P:1573.36 E:0.028822 |  Dreades there I haven't seen the fourth official
[3027.40 - 3032.52] P:1690.93 E:0.027849 |  But we surely are now playing time added on as Gary Neville looks for the cell the cells want a free kick
[3032.80 - 3034.80] P:1718.90 E:0.032426 |  Will there be time to take it?
[3034.80 - 3039.72] P:1742.35 E:0.031918 |  Have you seen the fourth official? Well, I've seen him he's just patrolling like a schoolmaster on the sidelines there
[3039.72 - 3041.72] P:1674.42 E:0.025928 |  He's bothered a bit of board up
[3042.68 - 3050.30] P:1774.41 E:0.031736 |  Free kick taken by England headed away by Calvier. We've just got news about Wayne Rooney kicked on the foot apparently and we must hope there's no
[3051.30 - 3055.30] P:1869.47 E:0.035602 |  Bones broken and that it's just simply bruising that can be dealt with
[3055.78 - 3061.02] P:1800.04 E:0.029284 |  With ice treatment and all sorts of stuff like that. Anyway, Rooney's off the game out of the game
[3061.06 - 3065.22] P:1699.56 E:0.030622 |  We're playing time added on here in Lisbon England leading through Michael Owens goal
[3065.22 - 3068.30] P:1669.06 E:0.030402 |  And this might be Portugal's last chance to equalize before halftime
[3068.82 - 3071.62] P:1735.70 E:0.032796 |  Ronaldo now down the right-hand side Figo down the left
[3072.14 - 3076.14] P:1756.84 E:0.035195 |  Ersmire the referee sends the players to the dressing room for halftime
[3076.38 - 3083.26] P:1849.31 E:0.032082 |  And of course this was the way that it was in England's opening game England led France one day at halftime through Frank Lampard's goal
[3083.78 - 3087.22] P:1848.25 E:0.033151 |  Tonight they struck after only three minutes through Michael Owen
[3087.58 - 3094.66] P:1816.95 E:0.031906 |  They lost Wayne Rooney halfway through the first half having been kicked on the foot. They have picked up yellow cards to two of their
[3095.42 - 3098.30] P:1762.98 E:0.028604 |  Very important players Stephen Gerrard and Gary Neville
[3098.50 - 3105.66] P:1782.46 E:0.029648 |  But at least England have the lead and apparently the the last word on Rooney at the moment is no word at all the football association
[3105.78 - 3110.90] P:1909.84 E:0.027614 |  Don't know as yet how bad the Rooney injury is so the halftime score line here
[3111.42 - 3115.86] P:1841.98 E:0.026397 |  England one Portugal no Graham Taylor England manager Euro 92
[3115.86 - 3120.34] P:1766.35 E:0.030183 |  It's an astonishingly open game. Does that suit England or not only if they score
[3120.86 - 3127.34] P:1566.03 E:0.029883 |  I would say it has been so open and one has to say that Portugal have had more of that possession
[3127.70 - 3132.98] P:1621.26 E:0.026755 |  As the game has progressed, but you've always got the feeling that England can get a second goal
[3133.06 - 3139.90] P:1618.99 E:0.027178 |  It says Terry Butcher said earlier that in fact the two Portuguese full-backs do push on and there is that space in behind them
[3139.90 - 3145.66] P:1587.93 E:0.027396 |  As I said earlier, I think Michael Owen has had an absolutely terrific game a little bit disturb us about John Terry
[3145.66 - 3151.50] P:1426.81 E:0.027926 |  I've seen John Terry have have a better game than he's had at the moment and the quick interpassing of the Portuguese players
[3151.58 - 3155.78] P:1460.46 E:0.024889 |  Can put a cause problems one nil up have a look at the halftime
[3156.26 - 3160.30] P:1554.10 E:0.027519 |  Just get a breather get yourself together again and then come out
[3160.34 - 3164.02] P:1537.25 E:0.030220 |  But if we're gonna see the second half like the first half mark
[3164.14 - 3168.70] P:1733.69 E:0.029284 |  We're really gonna be on the edge of our seats. How have England changed as an attacking force
[3169.46 - 3172.90] P:1605.71 E:0.026656 |  Because of Rooney going off and the cell coming on if they have at all
[3172.90 - 3177.66] P:1680.16 E:0.028892 |  Well, I don't think they've changed too much. We say that you know Michaels Owen has coming back into the hole
[3177.66 - 3182.78] P:1691.32 E:0.033280 |  He was actually I'd picked up early that in Rooney were sharing that role
[3182.78 - 3188.70] P:1629.11 E:0.030444 |  That's what I felt early on but I think now with the cell coming on then the cell is a front man
[3188.70 - 3191.34] P:1682.13 E:0.030686 |  I mean, I'm as I say having worked with the dress
[3191.34 - 3194.38] P:1657.21 E:0.032342 |  He can come off but not in the way that Rooney does
[3194.66 - 3202.54] P:1630.41 E:0.032321 |  Vaselle is on the edge of people very powerful very strong and he now has a great opportunity to make his mark and then Owen will
[3202.54 - 3206.78] P:1661.25 E:0.028989 |  Take that responsibility. I've seen him talking to Vaselle and he'll take the responsibility
[3206.78 - 3211.54] P:1627.51 E:0.031463 |  I honestly I can't speak too highly about Michael Owen's performance in this first half
[3211.54 - 3217.34] P:1656.73 E:0.027815 |  I think it's been absolutely first class. How have England in your opinion dealt with Figo and particularly Ronaldo
[3217.54 - 3223.26] P:1662.02 E:0.032059 |  Well, Ronaldo is difficult to to deal with because one has to say that he does get fouled
[3223.26 - 3228.54] P:1654.41 E:0.032767 |  But also he does fall to the ground very easily and so one has to watch that in the main
[3228.70 - 3230.62] P:1612.02 E:0.031173 |  They've handled it reasonably well
[3230.62 - 3235.22] P:1663.31 E:0.030183 |  I'm just a bit concerned about the openness of the game and the room that sometimes
[3235.22 - 3242.22] P:1668.61 E:0.028733 |  Deco gets to be able to provide the passing and finally just before we go to the news is it valid to have a conversation about the referee or not
[3243.10 - 3246.06] P:1869.26 E:0.031392 |  I mean in other words, it's you know, it will leave in itself out
[3246.06 - 3248.06] P:1825.37 E:0.033231 |  He's given a few stinking decisions in the first half

[3906.10 - 3910.90] P:1445.71 E:0.040300 |  Well, I don't know. It's very tense. I was trying to kiss people with that goal, but they were running away from me
[3910.98 - 3915.94] P:1577.47 E:0.033989 |  What's the matter with them here? I'm not surprised. I'm not blaming them. Let's talk to graham taylor about the michael owing goal
[3915.94 - 3920.42] P:1744.63 E:0.028076 |  We actually haven't discussed the goal as yet. We discussed how well he's played his all-round performance
[3920.58 - 3925.38] P:1712.14 E:0.031047 |  But it's amazing to keep his head and it was a it's a fabulous pirouette through pretty well a full revolution
[3925.38 - 3930.02] P:1677.72 E:0.031285 |  Yeah, but he'd read it. I mean the two centre backs of portugal really they gave no information
[3930.26 - 3935.70] P:1572.97 E:0.028360 |  To costina in front of them allowed him to backpedal and had it blindly back to the keeper
[3936.02 - 3941.86] P:1739.58 E:0.032457 |  And in fact, uh, I think it was car value had let michael owing run and then it was a great finish for him because you know
[3942.02 - 3944.10] P:1968.05 E:0.036971 |  He took it early you ask any goalkeeper
[3944.10 - 3947.86] P:1942.22 E:0.035546 |  They don't want they don't want the early strike because they can't position themselves
[3948.26 - 3953.06] P:1813.16 E:0.035708 |  And just recently michael has been taken an extra touch because of that lack of confidence
[3953.38 - 3956.90] P:1801.32 E:0.037215 |  But here whipped it in over in a very very good finish
[3957.30 - 3963.22] P:1893.54 E:0.032377 |  If you're on the road for the next 45 minutes, please drive carefully if you're at home remove anything breakable
[3963.70 - 3968.74] P:1830.25 E:0.031719 |  Within arms reach it could be a roller coaster ride. It seems to back out the referee is back out
[3968.74 - 3972.34] P:1723.01 E:0.023653 |  And alan green here we go again
[3974.74 - 3976.74] P:1471.22 E:0.033840 |  England need another goal
[3977.22 - 3978.98] P:1423.11 E:0.037177 |  I don't think um
[3978.98 - 3980.98] P:1589.09 E:0.038492 |  This game that is so open
[3981.54 - 3983.54] P:1576.98 E:0.038774 |  I can't see portugal not scoring
[3984.74 - 3986.74] P:1664.72 E:0.039143 |  We'll see no further changes
[3986.98 - 3991.38] P:1361.82 E:0.042465 |  Um, so portugal's lineup is as follows. Ricardo is the goalkeeper the defenders on michael
[3991.86 - 3994.34] P:1373.89 E:0.040362 |  covalho andrade and mila valente
[3994.90 - 3997.46] P:1534.77 E:0.041784 |  And midfield of costinia and maniche
[3997.70 - 4002.66] P:1565.40 E:0.041029 |  They're the defensive ones ahead of them figo deco and rinaldo and the lone striker nuna gomez
[4003.30 - 4008.10] P:1788.16 E:0.038572 |  England have had to make the one change of course really off engine up to 26 minutes for cell on
[4008.50 - 4014.98] P:1725.55 E:0.038081 |  So it's james and goal defenders neville terry camber cole midfield beckham jerrod lampard scores
[4015.70 - 4022.02] P:1696.13 E:0.035317 |  And the striker is now on the goal scorer after less than three minutes and the cell who will be furthest forward
[4022.42 - 4025.14] P:1628.26 E:0.024426 |  Um, I'd like to see a bit more from beckham
[4026.34 - 4029.46] P:1430.82 E:0.035110 |  But that's been true of the whole of euro 2004 so far
[4030.10 - 4033.30] P:1500.25 E:0.030013 |  lampard flicks the ball to ashley cole cole
[4033.94 - 4038.74] P:1614.60 E:0.030520 |  beaten by the tackle from miguel and deco has certainly been the danger man deco
[4039.46 - 4042.02] P:1725.18 E:0.034361 |  Oh, wow. He gets another soft free kick
[4042.66 - 4045.86] P:1755.02 E:0.030432 |  So many soft free kicks being um won by deco
[4046.50 - 4051.94] P:1587.86 E:0.032761 |  Or at least awarded by ursmire the referee it's taken and it's forward to nuna gomez and nuna gomez
[4052.18 - 4056.42] P:1740.14 E:0.031250 |  To figure on the far side the portuguese left just to the left of england's penalty
[4056.90 - 4061.54] P:1778.50 E:0.032855 |  Checks onto his right foot not once but twice plays it back shot a chip in straight into the arms of james
[4061.94 - 4066.66] P:1823.86 E:0.033506 |  It was munich who lashed it in there was a good strike on the outside of his right foot. It's an inside left channel
[4067.22 - 4072.58] P:1610.97 E:0.033111 |  Comfortably saved by david james, but so straight away. You see that deco has gone on and played in a more advanced role
[4072.66 - 4074.66] P:1581.61 E:0.034568 |  Just going up alongside nuna gomez as well
[4074.98 - 4078.10] P:1673.15 E:0.031818 |  And i'm going forward without the try and push men forward to try and win it back
[4078.10 - 4080.74] P:1613.96 E:0.030895 |  And hopefully that might leave a bit of spice for viselle and ferroan
[4081.14 - 4086.02] P:1772.55 E:0.033092 |  england and their white shirts attacking the goal to our left in this second half
[4086.42 - 4090.82] P:1706.95 E:0.032158 |  And we'll play by nuna valentino the far side and then it's backed by munich to his goalkeeper
[4090.90 - 4091.70] P:1723.88 E:0.028450 |  rickardo
[4091.70 - 4096.50] P:1702.51 E:0.035964 |  Tell me this to goalkeepers escape this rule about tucking in the shirts then terry because the fourth official was
[4096.98 - 4101.94] P:1743.96 E:0.032367 |  Incredibly pedantic when viselle came on and rickardo has his shirt outside his shorts
[4102.74 - 4105.06] P:1697.19 E:0.034350 |  Nazi level empty on the far side the left back you know
[4105.06 - 4111.54] P:1682.47 E:0.034140 |  See the five live in the bbc england lead portugal by a golden ale and the quarter final of euro 2004
[4112.10 - 4115.94] P:1742.43 E:0.038062 |  It's back and it's with figo and there's danger figo's shot though was well wide
[4116.58 - 4118.18] P:1751.57 E:0.035552 |  And he's disappointed
[4118.18 - 4122.18] P:1755.73 E:0.033671 |  You know, i just see gary neville then talking to his two central midfield players that tuck across
[4122.50 - 4125.78] P:1397.12 E:0.036156 |  You've got to get across if the balls are going out wide david beckham goes out wide
[4126.02 - 4128.02] P:1709.29 E:0.030987 |  Then it's up to gerard to get out
[4128.10 - 4130.58] P:1633.47 E:0.037063 |  And it's up to lampard to slide across as well and skulls
[4130.90 - 4136.34] P:1648.37 E:0.038101 |  That england midfielder's got to slide across and leave the least dangerous player, which is the opposite wide midfield player
[4136.82 - 4142.10] P:1730.00 E:0.037060 |  David james who made one worrying fumble in the first half had got away with it takes the goal kick
[4142.50 - 4146.74] P:1719.65 E:0.030859 |  Here's gerard can't control that header and it's with nuna gomez
[4147.38 - 4154.42] P:1716.97 E:0.034447 |  Who finds munich and munich looking to the right side and rinaldo cold comes short good play by rinaldo into deco
[4154.50 - 4158.82] P:1772.69 E:0.036657 |  Onto rinaldo again actually called excellent tackle though. He has to put it behind for a corner
[4159.30 - 4162.58] P:1611.32 E:0.034370 |  He had to get you had to make the tackle because it was just about inside the box
[4162.58 - 4166.42] P:1559.70 E:0.035976 |  And it was uh, going to go right on to rinaldo to put it into the box and uh
[4166.66 - 4173.22] P:1750.74 E:0.037100 |  Actually cold got back in time good good tackle first corner of the second half of portugal deco to take it from the right hand side
[4174.26 - 4178.90] P:1736.33 E:0.036750 |  And here it comes the corner for portugal deep and james punches it when he could easily have got that
[4179.22 - 4182.90] P:1670.12 E:0.032797 |  It was a good punch in the end one bounce in the title playing the far side of the field
[4183.70 - 4188.90] P:1652.04 E:0.028885 |  My direction sometimes soon think of a defensive midfield player to look after deco
[4190.50 - 4194.58] P:1383.98 E:0.032308 |  Yeah, you may have to but uh, we wouldn't take anybody off at the moment the balance of the team is not bad
[4194.58 - 4197.78] P:1447.02 E:0.031635 |  But uh, minglin just camped in their own half. They can't get out of the moment
[4198.98 - 4200.98] P:1678.50 E:0.037764 |  England holding on to one nil
[4201.46 - 4206.74] P:1721.26 E:0.034684 |  And they think how much they held on to one nil in the opening game of their group against france
[4206.74 - 4208.74] P:1720.67 E:0.034783 |  And then it all went wrong and stop each time
[4209.54 - 4212.98] P:1583.07 E:0.034700 |  The throw into portugal on the far side level with the edge of the england penalty area
[4213.30 - 4215.30] P:1928.72 E:0.032121 |  It goes back to maniche and maniche
[4215.86 - 4217.86] P:1678.24 E:0.033044 |  Hits it into the center circle in cavalia
[4217.86 - 4222.82] P:1578.76 E:0.035222 |  There's not an england player within 15 yards of the halfway line now miguel the right back and it's starved forward
[4223.06 - 4225.46] P:1665.67 E:0.038175 |  And here's the dangerous deco deco though
[4226.18 - 4228.82] P:1632.61 E:0.038412 |  That was a poor touch from him and cold hits it off the
[4229.46 - 4233.46] P:1699.66 E:0.039313 |  Brazilian stroke portuguese has had a play for a throw into england hold to take it
[4234.42 - 4240.98] P:1573.06 E:0.040419 |  And we've only played three and a half minutes in a long time to go good ball by deco and ronaldo but ronaldo was slowly react
[4241.38 - 4246.10] P:1606.55 E:0.035439 |  And it goes beyond him and behind for a goal kick. I mean is it really 41 minutes to go?
[4247.70 - 4252.66] P:1654.04 E:0.036160 |  I think we went down this road quite a few times and pretty recently as well, but uh, even though they fend him pretty well
[4254.10 - 4258.10] P:1868.67 E:0.035909 |  The danger is deco if he gets the ball in and around the edge of that box if he touching is down
[4258.74 - 4261.94] P:1782.58 E:0.034439 |  And uh, portuguese they just got to get more men into the box if possible
[4262.34 - 4265.70] P:1825.23 E:0.031666 |  James takes the goal kick towards the right side beckon this time's his jump
[4266.02 - 4269.62] P:1809.60 E:0.030640 |  Here's figo the other number seven back to maniche figo again
[4269.62 - 4275.06] P:1669.37 E:0.031751 |  They put a lot of the ball in this second half for jubo figo to the left side and nuno valente
[4275.62 - 4278.98] P:1589.12 E:0.035184 |  And nuno gomez is the only portuguese player looking in the edge of the penalty area
[4279.14 - 4280.74] P:1715.94 E:0.029928 |  They see a lot of the ball
[4280.74 - 4282.74] P:1604.44 E:0.031087 |  And in the middle of the england half
[4283.06 - 4286.34] P:1648.69 E:0.030928 |  Have they got the penetration that will find them an equalizer?
[4286.82 - 4292.02] P:1710.12 E:0.029777 |  Costinha why turn into valente figo makes the break and lampar was slow to go with him
[4292.10 - 4297.06] P:1725.24 E:0.030824 |  Figo gets the pass from nuno valente why turn into valente again who checks beckham is facing up
[4297.70 - 4301.86] P:1745.76 E:0.033831 |  Deep inside the england half valente gets the cross in james hoy fumbles again
[4302.82 - 4308.58] P:1862.89 E:0.031160 |  Goodness gracious that it's behind for well, maybe it's a free kick no excuse no excuse at all
[4309.54 - 4314.02] P:1536.60 E:0.032462 |  No valente actually crossed the ball right on the touch line the ball was houring towards the the near post
[4314.02 - 4318.58] P:1782.96 E:0.033924 |  David james comes terrible. I think the ball actually might have just struck the post and then david james named
[4318.58 - 4322.82] P:1970.68 E:0.037704 |  It was one of those ones where david james couldn't go through the post the post was in his way dropped it
[4323.06 - 4326.66] P:1970.50 E:0.036540 |  In the referee deemed that it was a foul on david james. I think it was gomez
[4327.14 - 4330.10] P:1881.95 E:0.036956 |  That fouled him when he was going for the rebound that was uh, that was pretty scary
[4330.74 - 4336.26] P:1797.70 E:0.033264 |  You know, I don't make many notes about players, but alongside david james name. I've got mistake waiting to happen

[4350.98 - 4354.50] P:1742.49 E:0.036214 |  Campbell retrieves his earlier mistake clears it to gerard and here's lampard
[4355.14 - 4358.98] P:1646.97 E:0.030100 |  Gerard again gerard and gary neville both booked in the first half

[4377.30 - 4379.62] P:1645.20 E:0.036539 |  Nunavalante in the fire this watch has got to be wrong
[4381.22 - 4382.66] P:1924.96 E:0.029391 |  Here's manish
[4382.66 - 4385.14] P:1656.25 E:0.034444 |  Manish left of the center circle to nunavalante
[4385.70 - 4387.70] P:1695.49 E:0.035165 |  Deco's down the left flank at the moment
[4387.94 - 4388.82] P:1753.01 E:0.031648 |  and
[4388.82 - 4395.14] P:1698.78 E:0.031885 |  Nunavalante cuts infield he's midway inside the england half and now it's to deco gary neville comes close
[4395.54 - 4401.22] P:1724.37 E:0.030780 |  Deco moving to his right finds figo figo checks and then he's well tackled by lampard
[4401.30 - 4405.30] P:1693.22 E:0.037573 |  Will the ball break hard enough towards owen it doesn't it's well played by miguel
[4406.10 - 4408.10] P:1881.19 E:0.035008 |  and the portuguese fans
[4408.42 - 4414.18] P:1676.72 E:0.034026 |  Sense that the momentum is with their team even though they trailing them by golden elv scored by michael owen
[4414.66 - 4420.02] P:1741.00 E:0.033555 |  With less than three minutes played in this the first of the quarter finals in euro 2004

[4422.18 - 4428.98] P:1678.85 E:0.032130 |  To portugal miguel takes it and plays it to manish and manish whips the pass quickly to the far side the left flank and nunavalante
[4429.46 - 4432.10] P:1659.58 E:0.032607 |  Technically, they're very good. Have they got the penetration?
[4432.42 - 4436.58] P:1635.79 E:0.035656 |  Figo comes forward again a couple of stepovers from in we know where we're now lou learned it from
[4436.66 - 4442.74] P:1713.48 E:0.034983 |  Here's renauld edge of the penalty here his shot blocked well blocked by ashley coal and that rebounds out of play on the halfway line
[4442.82 - 4444.26] P:1658.27 E:0.033862 |  Yeah, it's typical portuguese players
[4444.26 - 4449.46] P:1543.64 E:0.034341 |  Isn't it they have all the ball they spread the play from left to right about nine or ten passes and then get to the edge of the box
[4449.54 - 4451.94] P:1492.15 E:0.033930 |  And they don't get a shot they don't get a shot on target
[4451.94 - 4455.22] P:1579.85 E:0.033266 |  They don't get any real chances, but they have a lot of possession which is worrying
[4455.86 - 4460.66] P:1666.63 E:0.032722 |  Graham taylor is alongside me the former england captain and graham and others said amongst england substitutes that
[4461.06 - 4464.34] P:1543.56 E:0.031536 |  Limbering up on this touchliner fill neville and no one hargues

[4469.38 - 4473.38] P:1662.56 E:0.034203 |  I mean portugal having so much of the possession at the present time that it is worrying
[4473.70 - 4480.02] P:1866.41 E:0.037076 |  And that it probably you know sooner or later. I think spend garen erickson will have to probably consider making that change
[4480.74 - 4482.58] P:1905.98 E:0.037347 |  Lampard towards cold under left side
[4482.58 - 4486.98] P:1696.00 E:0.033952 |  He's tackled and I thought he was fired by renauld but renauld gets away with it and then he plays it off

[4494.10 - 4496.10] P:1782.33 E:0.025893 |  But he doesn't afford
[4496.18 - 4500.34] P:1739.13 E:0.028772 |  A great deal of defensive support to ashley coal down this england left flank terry
[4500.42 - 4505.14] P:1668.53 E:0.034530 |  While he's sliding across well on the balls across the other side england they're very very good in two terms of two banks of
[4505.14 - 4508.66] P:1650.58 E:0.032747 |  four stopping portugal really getting into the box and making chances but
[4509.46 - 4515.06] P:1597.88 E:0.033718 |  Still giving portugal a lot of possession. Here's nunagomas. He's supposed to be the furthest form of player for portugal
[4515.38 - 4516.98] P:1664.36 E:0.030076 |  And he wins a throw in
[4516.98 - 4518.34] P:1815.12 E:0.025717 |  An outrageous decision
[4518.34 - 4522.50] P:1593.34 E:0.029898 |  Well, the referee actually pointed to the lines and saying I think it's for for england and the lines went no
[4522.50 - 4525.62] P:1442.88 E:0.031764 |  I think it's for portugal so the referee says okay, then it's for portugal. Why not then?
[4526.02 - 4528.82] P:1618.70 E:0.033129 |  Eight and a half minutes gone on the second half england one portugal no

[4535.78 - 4541.70] P:1730.32 E:0.034605 |  Bucket goes to andrade and drady stabs it wickedly out of play. Thank you very much. We'll take that
[4542.34 - 4546.18] P:1636.40 E:0.031465 |  Throw in on the halfway line to england a little bit of the pace has gone out of the game
[4546.18 - 4549.70] P:1585.63 E:0.032028 |  Yeah, they've had a good sort of start to the second half at portugal a lot of possession
[4549.78 - 4551.78] P:1706.18 E:0.028111 |  no chances apart from that sort
[4551.94 - 4554.66] P:1544.34 E:0.032645 |  Slip by david james at the near post but they've had a lot of possession
[4554.66 - 4557.46] P:1574.73 E:0.031539 |  There's been nine minutes and he said sometimes you think well, they may just want out of steam
[4557.86 - 4562.18] P:1706.60 E:0.036183 |  Here's michael oan right of the pen here michael oan into the box and then the defender did an exceptionally well
[4563.06 - 4564.50] P:1791.51 E:0.031890 |  That was Carvalho
[4564.50 - 4566.98] P:1709.94 E:0.036124 |  He held off michael oan didn't like oan's protest
[4567.46 - 4570.66] P:1744.30 E:0.032555 |  But play continues it was well defended and there's michael
[4570.82 - 4576.10] P:1784.67 E:0.034356 |  He's got a possession goal can he find goals can't quite find goals ball taken off him by rinaldo
[4576.90 - 4578.90] P:1637.06 E:0.030167 |  Just a half chance for oan there
[4579.30 - 4581.30] P:1539.58 E:0.029145 |  Who had an absolutely fantastic first half?
[4582.26 - 4584.26] P:1770.62 E:0.031086 |  Now on the far side
[4584.42 - 4588.02] P:1725.48 E:0.038361 |  Figo the skipper once more the last of the golden generation
[4588.42 - 4593.14] P:1724.03 E:0.035552 |  And his international career might finish here tonight in lisbon if england win this game
[4593.54 - 4598.66] P:1775.92 E:0.032371 |  Figo's not finished crosses into the penalty here. Thank goodness this time. It was a clean catch by james
[4598.74 - 4600.34] P:1715.50 E:0.035741 |  Like I say england are defending well
[4600.34 - 4605.22] P:1420.09 E:0.035554 |  They're doubling up beckham and garrion evill on the figure the cross coming in right on the goal line towards an ear post
[4605.54 - 4610.02] P:1770.58 E:0.036376 |  One person in the box for portugal gomez well marked with a two-cent and a half james to a comfortable catch
[4610.26 - 4612.02] P:1880.10 E:0.034768 |  10 minutes gone in the second half
[4612.02 - 4617.06] P:1748.14 E:0.036104 |  The ball might break to oan and it does break to a good run by lampard forward for cells also inside the penalty area
[4617.54 - 4621.78] P:1763.65 E:0.031952 |  oan plays it to lampard and lampard looking to lay it off towards goals
[4621.86 - 4626.82] P:1709.99 E:0.028795 |  And that's a good tackle by miguel ball breaks away david beckham very deep on the far side and beckham
[4627.06 - 4630.58] P:1668.69 E:0.030425 |  Flicks it over at nudival empty and then that's over hit that pass from beckham
[4630.82 - 4634.02] P:1653.39 E:0.033199 |  And it's through to ricardo michael oan was in wasn't in the inside right channel
[4634.10 - 4637.54] P:1478.07 E:0.029628 |  And beckham tried to play it through the middle to the cell comfortable take by ricardo
[4638.26 - 4644.10] P:1681.23 E:0.031810 |  Well graham taylor um rightly said the other day in the creation match what you need are eight or nine players to play really well
[4644.82 - 4650.18] P:1742.30 E:0.036261 |  David beckham is yet to play but he's won a free kick here. There was a foul and it's a yellow card
[4650.66 - 4652.66] P:1961.84 E:0.035272 |  hooray
[4653.22 - 4654.02] P:2042.88 E:0.031144 |  Costina
[4654.02 - 4661.14] P:1913.03 E:0.031790 |  But I don't really say hooray because I think the referee has been exceptionally lenient with the portuguese players and not so with england
[4661.22 - 4664.50] P:1583.03 E:0.030254 |  I can't believe christina goes up to beckham and says you dived there, but uh
[4665.22 - 4670.02] P:1650.76 E:0.035324 |  I would say to costina you ever wear the one or two of your players particularly your forward very deco in ronaldo and say
[4670.26 - 4675.70] P:1748.10 E:0.033020 |  Hang on a minute. Is i think his pot calling the kettle black here on that situation. I've got a crystal ball here's fill level on for skulls
[4676.34 - 4680.34] P:1908.70 E:0.032444 |  I told you it's too open and deco's being afforded too much room
[4681.14 - 4686.02] P:1696.68 E:0.029542 |  Well he is and uh, it's interesting to see here what uh, if jared comes out to the left hand side
[4686.50 - 4691.06] P:1506.78 E:0.031319 |  Fill level yes jared come to the left hand side fill never going alongside frank lampard in the heart of that
[4691.22 - 4692.42] P:1776.80 E:0.022278 |  Even defense
[4692.42 - 4697.06] P:1791.37 E:0.029337 |  Uh, it's too much as I thought it's too far out this free kick for a shot from david beckham
[4697.14 - 4698.34] P:1874.93 E:0.025682 |  You would think
[4698.34 - 4701.54] P:1878.95 E:0.028429 |  40 yards outside so he takes a short to skulls back to beckham
[4701.62 - 4706.82] P:1793.24 E:0.032250 |  jared's made the run into the left edge of the penalty area and the ball is played by beckham to jared jared controls it
[4707.14 - 4710.82] P:1710.99 E:0.034650 |  He said back to ashley call well done call that was another foul challenge by nunagomas
[4711.06 - 4714.18] P:1818.31 E:0.034190 |  Cole continues crosses into the penalty area and basel jumped
[4714.58 - 4719.30] P:1680.56 E:0.032718 |  But not before ricardo would caught the ball there's a comfortable take but basel gets up pretty quickly
[4719.30 - 4722.02] P:1540.56 E:0.030928 |  I'm pleased that jared to be fair is out to his left hand side
[4722.02 - 4726.26] P:1591.30 E:0.032603 |  We saw it again switzerland when he went out here when he scored from this position as well that he's he's athletic
[4726.26 - 4732.02] P:1573.55 E:0.033631 |  He's quick and he gives him the sort of extra dimension down as that's like cold. They help cold. Well, yeah, miguel
[4732.66 - 4734.18] P:1836.85 E:0.039623 |  hits it forward
[4734.18 - 4737.14] P:1871.41 E:0.037481 |  Cole and uh, rinaldo collided
[4738.10 - 4740.10] P:1882.89 E:0.034952 |  The referee has decided it's a free kick
[4740.74 - 4742.26] P:1996.04 E:0.029941 |  to portugal
[4742.26 - 4745.22] P:1821.78 E:0.030382 |  And scolari looked as if he wanted ashley Cole booked
[4745.46 - 4748.58] P:1706.15 E:0.025076 |  Well, it was one of those ones rinaldo just plays it
[4748.58 - 4749.38] P:1682.44 E:0.032397 |  It was a fire
[4749.38 - 4755.54] P:1525.42 E:0.031817 |  He plays it inside and then Cole's come to win the ball is committed rinaldo plays it on the move tries to get the other side of ashley
[4755.54 - 4757.86] P:1485.10 E:0.027496 |  Cole ashley Cole says no you're not pulls him down free kick
[4758.02 - 4761.06] P:1661.78 E:0.032527 |  Chalvin it's played in the second half england won portugal little here
[4761.62 - 4766.10] P:1799.81 E:0.031866 |  In the study of the lutz in lisbon and now portugal have a corner after
[4766.66 - 4768.50] P:1742.34 E:0.029422 |  Tackled by cambo on
[4768.50 - 4770.26] P:1691.91 E:0.025812 |  the uh, beagle

[4774.42 - 4779.94] P:1698.84 E:0.031482 |  And then have everybody back inside the penalty again. There it goes didn't beat the first uh defender
[4780.02 - 4782.02] P:1619.90 E:0.030623 |  Who was david beckham beckham's headed away?
[4782.18 - 4784.18] P:1662.23 E:0.027261 |  Deco uh was alert to the
[4784.74 - 4788.34] P:1679.88 E:0.032318 |  Presence of all now he flicks it over on and he tried to flick it into the penalty here
[4788.34 - 4790.34] P:1554.17 E:0.026530 |  It's headed out of play by phil neville
[4790.34 - 4793.70] P:1583.96 E:0.028026 |  Figo with a throw in to deco once more neville comes close
[4794.10 - 4800.10] P:1717.48 E:0.029565 |  It's forward to feagle feagle to deco first time cross into the penalty here towards the far post towards christina
[4800.34 - 4802.82] P:1583.02 E:0.038232 |  Headed into ronaldo ronaldo heads at howling white
[4803.46 - 4806.34] P:1596.37 E:0.034375 |  Well in the first game against greece a corner came in from the far side
[4806.34 - 4810.10] P:1524.17 E:0.032384 |  It was ronaldo that got his head to the ball, but he's had two chances since that match
[4810.42 - 4812.58] P:1585.22 E:0.030017 |  One against spain when the ball came in from the left hand side
[4812.58 - 4817.30] P:1546.65 E:0.031415 |  Which he put over the bar once then a header back across to great header back across and it was ronaldo
[4817.30 - 4820.18] P:1580.65 E:0.036987 |  They got in front of sol cambo. It was a difficult chance in a way
[4820.18 - 4824.66] P:1600.72 E:0.038379 |  You have to really sort of crane his neck right along the six yard line right level with the near post put it over the bar
[4825.22 - 4830.42] P:1888.50 E:0.037811 |  Each time he's played for the starter he's come on ronaldo has been a serious aerial threat
[4831.14 - 4835.54] P:1695.08 E:0.036897 |  To every other defense. He's a big lad, isn't he? He's quite big, you know, he's like piresse
[4836.90 - 4839.94] P:1590.88 E:0.033940 |  He's big and once you get alongside him and see him against the other players
[4839.94 - 4845.30] P:1671.71 E:0.029892 |  He's very tall england fans aware that the pressure is on try to encourage the side
[4845.86 - 4847.94] P:1512.44 E:0.034781 |  england leading by a goal to nil and we've got
[4848.74 - 4851.30] P:1767.22 E:0.027525 |  That's sick and we've played 59 minutes
[4852.90 - 4854.50] P:1768.78 E:0.023070 |  Oh
[4854.98 - 4857.62] P:1803.35 E:0.028303 |  It's hard work when it's this much pressure
[4858.34 - 4859.78] P:1732.17 E:0.024282 |  Miguel
[4859.78 - 4861.46] P:1715.88 E:0.023557 |  back to deco
[4861.46 - 4862.58] P:1662.77 E:0.023244 |  deco
[4862.58 - 4867.46] P:1602.96 E:0.033901 |  Slips the ball to his left to andrade andrade up to the halfway line and nunavalante
[4867.86 - 4870.18] P:1518.95 E:0.037826 |  Overwhelmingly the game being played in the england half
[4870.18 - 4876.10] P:1704.57 E:0.038458 |  It's it for ronaldo's switch banks with figo and ronaldo heads it behind for a goal kick and it's the nerve to complain
[4878.10 - 4880.58] P:1747.33 E:0.035505 |  That was a definite goal kick well played gary neville
[4880.58 - 4883.46] P:1491.90 E:0.036206 |  It was one of those ones giving go where ronaldo laid the ball back
[4884.10 - 4888.18] P:1509.74 E:0.037044 |  And then went for the for the ball over to top in the left wing area gary neville actually headed the ball against ronaldo
[4888.42 - 4890.42] P:1758.95 E:0.036708 |  Ronaldo had the cheek to claim the corner
[4890.82 - 4892.82] P:1826.02 E:0.036509 |  Graham taylor to my right Graham
[4893.38 - 4896.50] P:1765.29 E:0.041514 |  The right move to bring on full level. Well, I think it is because
[4897.06 - 4902.82] P:1651.86 E:0.039289 |  I think they've got to try to stop deco playing to sort of they can so they can get a foot into the game because
[4903.14 - 4905.14] P:1608.95 E:0.038320 |  Really in this half we've done so little for
[4906.02 - 4909.46] P:1543.17 E:0.032355 |  Going forward having said that we have we've defended well
[4909.54 - 4915.46] P:1548.41 E:0.035671 |  We've restricted the opportunities that portugal have and that's very importantly continue to do that
[4915.54 - 4917.54] P:1697.45 E:0.036625 |  But I think he's made a right decision
[4917.86 - 4918.50] P:1801.56 E:0.027448 |  interesting
[4918.50 - 4924.50] P:1620.93 E:0.034219 |  Samal will be coming on shortly for portugal now wonder will that be for ronaldo or will it be another attacking threat for portugal
[4924.58 - 4927.22] P:1753.94 E:0.036242 |  It's hit forward towards figo who was falling gamble
[4927.46 - 4932.10] P:1671.20 E:0.032327 |  But gamble did well enough to find co here's phil neville the brother gary in the far side
[4932.58 - 4938.74] P:1588.06 E:0.030249 |  Back to phil and and neville this neville the younger neville heads it towards the halfway line where it's headed back by nunavalante
[4939.06 - 4942.10] P:1715.88 E:0.033104 |  And picked up by nunavalante who's dropped very deep. He gives it away
[4942.42 - 4946.18] P:1701.59 E:0.032430 |  Ashley Cole slides it forward oan is there cavalos with him oan
[4946.50 - 4953.38] P:1708.56 E:0.031175 |  Holes the ball up very well well played michael oan. He's having an exceptional game back to phil neville into beckham inside the center circle
[4953.54 - 4954.74] P:1694.77 E:0.037763 |  Vacell peels away
[4954.74 - 4959.30] P:1798.64 E:0.028158 |  But beckham decides safety first just a little bit of his right to gary neville back to beckham
[4959.78 - 4964.82] P:1827.65 E:0.032703 |  And then into the center circle it goes once more good footfall from england cambo to jerrod and jerrod
[4965.06 - 4967.54] P:1794.86 E:0.034126 |  While he he hurried that pass forward to oan
[4967.78 - 4970.18] P:1727.11 E:0.028639 |  He could have just beat the defender and kept the ball
[4970.90 - 4976.26] P:1788.70 E:0.032366 |  As it is he conceded possession, but it's one back now by terry and terry trying to squeeze it through to oan
[4976.34 - 4980.02] P:1749.68 E:0.029410 |  And again doesn't hit the pass from lean up here's figo down the right side
[4980.18 - 4983.30] P:1500.42 E:0.031820 |  Who would somal come on in your book for terry possibly figo
[4984.02 - 4988.02] P:1675.31 E:0.033952 |  Figo well that would be fascinating here is figo who's tackled by lampar
[4988.42 - 4991.54] P:1639.21 E:0.034929 |  And the ball breaks away to the far side to the halfway line and deco
[4992.02 - 4996.74] P:1609.14 E:0.034793 |  Deco being hustled by pacell can only find the head of back in the heads that had a plan here is the chain
[4996.82 - 5000.82] P:1707.82 E:0.039061 |  Or is it not quite yet? Oh, you got a turkey shirt in
[5001.54 - 5006.02] P:1839.19 E:0.035472 |  Yeah, pull up your socks. Yeah, pull up your socks took a shirt in. Oh, he's not telling him to tuck his shirt in
[5006.10 - 5008.10] P:1670.79 E:0.030268 |  Brush your head. It only applies to england players. Maybe
[5009.06 - 5014.98] P:1795.29 E:0.033813 |  Here's nuno gumis a good ball left from maniche taken up again by nuno gumis the shot was fiebel
[5015.70 - 5016.90] P:1941.00 E:0.030528 |  Easily safe

[5873.30 - 5876.82] P:1559.17 E:0.032253 |  So the slope round the pitch came off the pitch straight down a tunnel didn't go to the bench

[5916.02 - 5919.94] P:1554.07 E:0.033022 |  I think the man who really ran the game four years ago in einhoven

[5922.50 - 5928.10] P:1726.94 E:0.034047 |  Is going to come on in a moment for portugal another great hero of course in this country like figo now beckham

[5930.90 - 5935.62] P:1667.87 E:0.036186 |  Rani on the halfway line as lampard lifts it too wide, but oen will give up the chase. I think eventually
[5936.50 - 5940.10] P:1729.26 E:0.030953 |  And it's going to be a portugal throw. They haven't made the change yet
[5940.42 - 5944.10] P:1247.96 E:0.030379 |  No, you know why because they haven't got the piece of paper. I think for the fourth official
[5944.42 - 5947.30] P:1358.08 E:0.030885 |  It's got to be correct. There's got to be a the most decent handover
[5947.94 - 5950.26] P:1441.23 E:0.033547 |  Is I think the fourth official just gone through ruy cost
[5950.26 - 5954.50] P:1524.92 E:0.031173 |  They just made sure that the teeth are okay. The hair's fine and everything's all set deco for portugal
[5954.82 - 5957.62] P:1675.11 E:0.033665 |  Looking for ronaldo down the far side great challenge from gary neville

[5970.34 - 5973.94] P:1666.90 E:0.028954 |  And here come portugal now with deco with 12 minutes to go
[5974.74 - 5979.94] P:1687.50 E:0.033869 |  It's a real onslaught here from the home side chasing the game england really not producing much threat at the other end
[5979.94 - 5981.94] P:1762.90 E:0.031442 |  But they're defending superbly
[5981.94 - 5987.14] P:1788.94 E:0.034449 |  Sven Jorn Ericsson said a few days ago that he wouldn't change his back for for any of the other backfors in this tournament
[5987.62 - 5990.58] P:1917.09 E:0.034162 |  Well now portugal have to absolutely go for it here
[5991.06 - 5995.46] P:1883.85 E:0.034870 |  They're bringing on creative players. They're taking off the defender miguel the right back
[5996.18 - 5999.22] P:1703.66 E:0.034399 |  And ruy costo, but he won't play right back. Well, let's just see how they're going to
[5999.70 - 6003.78] P:1784.21 E:0.031122 |  Adjust here now. I think deco has just come out to the right-hand side ruy costo maniche
[6004.26 - 6005.06] P:1735.13 E:0.034646 |  Or in the middle
[6005.06 - 6007.30] P:1687.81 E:0.032079 |  They've virtually got a three-man attack with samar
[6007.70 - 6011.78] P:1594.07 E:0.035954 |  With nuno Gomez and with postiga up front ronaldo just drifting into the midfield
[6012.26 - 6017.94] P:1697.19 E:0.031590 |  So the original shape has been scrapped here by scolari in the second half of this game england are
[6018.58 - 6022.66] P:1381.03 E:0.035014 |  11 and a half minutes away from a semi-final. We'll hear from graham taylor in a moment
[6023.14 - 6027.86] P:1531.47 E:0.032989 |  It's a throw to england over on the far side. They just need now some moments on the ball
[6028.42 - 6031.14] P:1503.89 E:0.036276 |  It's a throw to portugal wide on the left far side of the field
[6031.86 - 6036.18] P:1508.61 E:0.037462 |  It'll be taken by the fullback valente gives ruy costo his first touch
[6036.66 - 6039.06] P:1485.36 E:0.039397 |  england know all about the danger from ruy costo
[6039.70 - 6041.70] P:1669.31 E:0.034581 |  Portugal now with

[6043.54 - 6047.30] P:1664.08 E:0.035603 |  It comes to deco down this near side. Ashley Cole's got deco up against him now
[6048.42 - 6054.82] P:1701.09 E:0.035454 |  It's a ruy costa trying to impose himself in the game settles into the rhythm of the match straight away offside is given
[6055.62 - 6057.62] P:1820.03 E:0.035555 |  And graham taylor, let's hear from you
[6058.18 - 6059.70] P:1845.21 E:0.030189 |  well
[6059.70 - 6063.78] P:1672.14 E:0.038582 |  I'm struggling at the moment to come to terms with what scolari has done to his team shape
[6064.26 - 6066.82] P:1732.21 E:0.039513 |  He has made all of a sudden the three substitutions
[6067.30 - 6071.86] P:1812.96 E:0.038844 |  And it's I think he's almost saying go on you're gonna have to play which I can understand to a degree
[6072.26 - 6078.34] P:1754.84 E:0.034077 |  He's left himself very short with I think the chance that england can break at them and can get that second goal
[6078.74 - 6084.98] P:1519.49 E:0.034586 |  I would say that defensively england have played very well against a lot of possession that the portuguese side have had
[6085.70 - 6089.38] P:1678.21 E:0.028943 |  But the ball is coming back constantly at the england team
[6089.86 - 6093.46] P:1752.82 E:0.032445 |  10 minutes away from winning this game the ball is now with nuno gomes

[6098.26 - 6101.06] P:1803.07 E:0.034466 |  Still a lot of work for spenior and arikson's team to do here
[6102.58 - 6106.10] P:1647.93 E:0.037234 |  england inviting portugal onto them at times in goes across james will say that

[6132.90 - 6139.30] P:1657.63 E:0.032576 |  But the clearance only drops to nuno valente and portugal have the initiative once more postigas there up against terry

[6246.74 - 6253.30] P:1714.37 E:0.039629 |  And the problem was it had been coming for a long time as england was forced to keep portugal of equalized
[6254.26 - 6258.74] P:1563.90 E:0.041926 |  Well, would you believe that what a substitution from scolari is virtually playing with four forwards
[6258.98 - 6262.26] P:1578.14 E:0.039087 |  Simao got the ball the first cross was blocked by david beckham
[6262.26 - 6265.38] P:1580.48 E:0.038292 |  It fell to his right foot and he just picked postiga out
[6265.46 - 6270.26] P:1657.11 E:0.039233 |  He had the simplest of headers and six yards unmarked in the box over the top of john terry
[6270.26 - 6277.30] P:1627.67 E:0.037391 |  Sol camble had a man ashley kohl had a man the spare man was postiga and he just glanced it past david james no chance

[6283.86 - 6285.86] P:1699.30 E:0.034628 |  Not quite as dramatic as the french game
[6286.82 - 6288.82] P:1837.05 E:0.033893 |  But england had been stung
[6288.98 - 6291.70] P:1884.17 E:0.035683 |  And now england have to do it all over again
[6292.98 - 6296.74] P:1742.55 E:0.036498 |  And the possibility of extra time starts to loom and england are looking tired

[6333.14 - 6336.34] P:1622.22 E:0.036727 |  Sven Jörn-Eriksen played against portugal the friendlies ended 1-1
[6337.54 - 6339.78] P:1730.80 E:0.033540 |  This one now locked on the same score line
[6340.74 - 6342.74] P:1742.28 E:0.033434 |  It's a portugal free kick
[6343.14 - 6347.38] P:1751.40 E:0.036112 |  And they've got schemao who of course was so instrumental in the goal
[6347.94 - 6349.94] P:1680.83 E:0.039274 |  They've got ruy costar as well
[6350.50 - 6352.50] P:1690.00 E:0.036231 |  And they've got postigo waiting in the airing

[6369.54 - 6375.78] P:1737.16 E:0.038012 |  And it's out of play for portugal throwing. We just over five minutes to go of normal time
[6376.58 - 6378.58] P:1727.29 E:0.037280 |  england won portugal one
[6378.74 - 6380.74] P:1641.30 E:0.037698 |  ball with portugal inevitably

[6389.46 - 6391.70] P:1680.22 E:0.041045 |  He's got no one into sport and then he's fouled
[6392.34 - 6398.02] P:1851.87 E:0.031367 |  By deco and deco will get a yellow card for that. It's a free kick to england and here's graham taylor
[6399.06 - 6400.42] P:1738.14 E:0.028850 |  Well, I
[6400.42 - 6402.02] P:1632.82 E:0.036136 |  One could argue that has been coming
[6402.02 - 6404.02] P:1619.33 E:0.037320 |  But the way it came was a surprise
[6404.34 - 6407.22] P:1743.99 E:0.037945 |  Once the first cross had been put out in the second cross
[6407.78 - 6412.90] P:1849.87 E:0.038888 |  In the penalty box the england defenders had plenty of time to assess what was round about them
[6413.30 - 6419.14] P:1779.31 E:0.038131 |  They weren't able to do that and postiga came in and got in between the defenders to equalize
[6419.70 - 6420.58] P:1604.19 E:0.036982 |  It's a matter now
[6420.58 - 6423.14] P:1632.28 E:0.038848 |  I was not saying well, we've got to go and win it in the next few minutes
[6423.14 - 6425.78] P:1694.50 E:0.035536 |  You've got to hold you've got to get yourself into the game
[6426.10 - 6429.70] P:1654.77 E:0.035103 |  There could yet be that period of extra time to come in and win it
[6429.94 - 6432.90] P:1698.43 E:0.038440 |  But it's a shame. It's a surprise that they lost the
[6433.54 - 6436.98] P:1608.32 E:0.039334 |  The equalizing goal by what would call an english type cross
[6439.38 - 6442.26] P:1613.59 E:0.038055 |  Is the first goal england have conceded from open play in this tournament
[6443.30 - 6445.62] P:1763.64 E:0.035892 |  And it's changed the whole atmosphere in this stadium
[6446.42 - 6448.42] P:1756.71 E:0.036460 |  england sitting too deep
[6448.98 - 6454.42] P:1692.46 E:0.036539 |  Portugal coming forward once more the ball is not in play ronaldo didn't manage to keep it in
[6455.06 - 6462.66] P:1773.78 E:0.033489 |  And england are four minutes away from the final whistle here plus out of time and maybe four minutes or so away from extra time
[6463.38 - 6465.38] P:1759.52 E:0.037201 |  Soul Campbell now england needs some possession
[6466.10 - 6468.10] P:1763.72 E:0.036578 |  Maniche is in the way for portugal
[6468.58 - 6471.70] P:1698.54 E:0.038805 |  Maniche england were unable to get the second which would have finished portugal off
[6471.86 - 6476.34] P:1695.37 E:0.038622 |  David beckham now has been penalized by ozmae and portugal take the free kick quickly
[6476.58 - 6480.26] P:1666.03 E:0.039435 |  england tired of course in the quarterfinal against brazil two years ago
[6480.50 - 6484.10] P:1726.83 E:0.037852 |  We're flagging a bit here portugal trying to win it in normal time
[6484.50 - 6487.38] P:1772.44 E:0.036871 |  They don't want extra time shot comes in and it's wasted this time
[6488.10 - 6494.58] P:1751.49 E:0.033132 |  And a goal kick to england david james to take it and this is why england now need a little bit of help and a bit of support from the bench
[6495.06 - 6499.06] P:1600.79 E:0.034807 |  They certainly do they just want to try and kill it if they can and just regroup into extra time but
[6499.70 - 6505.06] P:1608.42 E:0.038816 |  This is one of those what one of those ones where you have to add mascalari the portuguese coach because he pushed four men forward
[6505.06 - 6508.10] P:1516.37 E:0.038082 |  It was very brave. It was very bold. He knew about the counterattack from england
[6508.58 - 6512.98] P:1492.55 E:0.038401 |  But it was a soft goal to give away as one of those goals that you look back and you say why why
[6513.30 - 6517.94] P:1593.56 E:0.032204 |  Did we just pick up and mark and leave the spare man if there was one hargreys can't find knowing
[6518.58 - 6521.14] P:1776.54 E:0.034330 |  Scalari is in the tent is almost on the pitch down there
[6521.14 - 6525.14] P:1741.38 E:0.032077 |  There's no one from england though in the technical area trying to inspire from the sideline as
[6525.54 - 6531.06] P:1625.49 E:0.031937 |  Portugal clear ashley coals underneath it with a header trying to play in hargreys hargreys against deco
[6531.46 - 6533.94] P:1729.38 E:0.034886 |  And that's gone out of play for a portuguese throwing
[6534.42 - 6538.74] P:1828.01 E:0.037222 |  We've less than three minutes to go the england supporters are trying to lift their side
[6539.62 - 6542.74] P:1737.33 E:0.039607 |  We're heading for extra time in this first quarter final
[6543.30 - 6545.30] P:1790.10 E:0.039308 |  Silver goals and penalties of course
[6545.70 - 6552.10] P:1656.27 E:0.038290 |  Many people forecast this would be decided by penalties, but we're still a long long way away from that scenario
[6552.82 - 6555.94] P:1590.65 E:0.037122 |  It's portugal with a clearance from andrade looking for rinaldo
[6556.50 - 6558.74] P:1591.81 E:0.036304 |  rinaldo faced by ashley coal and hargreys
[6559.62 - 6562.98] P:1606.12 E:0.037457 |  Portugal having non-stop possession here in the second half. It's ruy costa
[6563.78 - 6565.54] P:1747.97 E:0.036228 |  onto miguel
[6565.54 - 6568.50] P:1672.36 E:0.037215 |  miguel into the area trying to find post again that was over hit
[6569.22 - 6571.62] P:1747.37 E:0.032390 |  and um, it's a goal kick that england
[6572.18 - 6573.70] P:1781.04 E:0.030465 |  Have been stung
[6573.70 - 6575.46] P:1666.56 E:0.031748 |  Right at the end of this game
[6575.46 - 6580.02] P:1770.84 E:0.033747 |  Like they were not quite so dramatically against france in the opening match one one
[6580.50 - 6583.86] P:1729.42 E:0.038120 |  And you just sensed terry that the forces were portugal at the moment
[6583.94 - 6589.06] P:1651.75 E:0.035999 |  Yeah, the force has been with portugal all the second half really has been one-way traffic with the first sporadic attacks from england
[6589.38 - 6591.78] P:1567.84 E:0.034438 |  But i thought the storm was weathered. I thought they've they've done it
[6591.86 - 6595.78] P:1698.35 E:0.033136 |  But you you never say never and against france as well. You thought that they've done it, but they hadn't
[6596.18 - 6597.06] P:1857.45 E:0.038714 |  You can see the goal now
[6597.06 - 6600.50] P:1852.96 E:0.034511 |  They've got to see it out to to extra time and these are the these players have to get through
[6600.58 - 6603.86] P:1651.18 E:0.032813 |  I think portugal are made three substitutions england have made three substitutions as well
[6603.94 - 6607.30] P:1579.27 E:0.031456 |  So these players if it does go to extra time, they've got to they've got to play
[6608.10 - 6610.10] P:1671.50 E:0.035829 |  Portugal once more moving forward
[6610.42 - 6613.62] P:1632.50 E:0.035924 |  ruy costa such a vital player to be able to bring on in this second half
[6614.18 - 6616.18] P:1698.27 E:0.036243 |  high ball towards rinaldo too high
[6617.30 - 6618.58] P:1747.41 E:0.031409 |  and uh
[6618.58 - 6621.94] P:1649.26 E:0.035144 |  At least portugal haven't gone on since they scored that equalizer
[6622.58 - 6624.26] P:1710.45 E:0.035971 |  and england
[6624.26 - 6626.26] P:1802.38 E:0.036050 |  have hung in there
[6626.26 - 6630.98] P:1775.65 E:0.038898 |  Philip neville to david beckham who's drifted into the center circle beckham turns on the ball against ruy costa
[6631.30 - 6634.98] P:1796.27 E:0.038844 |  Feeds philip neville philip neville lifts it forward trying to play the ball over andrade
[6635.06 - 6639.62] P:1694.70 E:0.037068 |  That's a header away and it was well judged by andrade. Otherwise viselle was looking for the bits and pieces
[6640.58 - 6645.14] P:1641.09 E:0.039326 |  Ball with that given away by portugal by cavallo, but it was a good recovery
[6645.62 - 6648.74] P:1811.97 E:0.039146 |  a referee's given the free kick against uh cavallo against
[6649.38 - 6651.38] P:1933.86 E:0.033993 |  His challenge on hargree's
[6651.38 - 6654.26] P:1731.11 E:0.037482 |  He's correct as well. That was a one minute to go of normal time
[6654.98 - 6658.90] P:1796.25 E:0.034399 |  And can this be the moment for england because there would be no coming back for portugal
[6659.22 - 6664.26] P:1806.94 E:0.034672 |  If they could finish this one off and this time cambell as he must do goes forward with john terry
[6664.58 - 6670.42] P:1944.97 E:0.034938 |  If ever there was a moment for david beckham to deliver one of his better free kicks, this is it
[6671.62 - 6674.58] P:1990.92 E:0.037971 |  england free kick right at the end of the game and it goes
[6674.82 - 6676.02] P:1640.77 E:0.041853 |  headed against the bar
[6676.02 - 6678.42] P:1688.27 E:0.043812 |  Campbell's should be the goal by england
[6679.14 - 6686.50] P:1838.64 E:0.037920 |  Campbell has scored the referee out has the referee given the goal. Oh, no, he hasn't and the game continues
[6687.86 - 6692.98] P:1626.32 E:0.039039 |  I thought what on earth is happening the ball is now with shimow england thought they'd won the game right at the end
[6694.74 - 6696.74] P:1673.95 E:0.037854 |  And we've got three minutes of added time
[6697.30 - 6700.42] P:1682.84 E:0.039103 |  portugal shoot over the bar now explain all that to me
[6701.46 - 6705.46] P:1680.68 E:0.038175 |  Well when the header came in i'm not too sure if it came off john terry or sol cambell the ball
[6705.54 - 6709.70] P:1757.73 E:0.036445 |  Fuddler against the crossbar came off sol cambell sol cambell then got up and there was two players
[6709.70 - 6712.82] P:1581.12 E:0.038584 |  They went up john terry and sol cambell the goalkeeper was nowhere near the ball
[6712.82 - 6718.10] P:1626.00 E:0.036613 |  He wasn't fouled he was blocked if anything on the goal line cambell thought he'd scored just like argentina
[6718.66 - 6725.14] P:1744.03 E:0.038340 |  1998 englander thought they got the winner the referee gave the free kick and then portugal broken it was two on one against england
[6726.74 - 6731.38] P:1877.29 E:0.030696 |  Just like the game against argentina in san eddie n cambell thought he'd done it
[6731.70 - 6734.42] P:1694.07 E:0.033518 |  We thought he'd done it all the england fans thought he'd done it
[6734.66 - 6740.82] P:1727.28 E:0.033178 |  We're now playing added time here at the end of the 90 minutes john terry for england long ball four looking for oan and the
[6740.82 - 6742.82] P:1718.54 E:0.033266 |  Goalkeeper will get that riccardo
[6743.30 - 6748.42] P:1785.50 E:0.032501 |  Well if england don't win this game now, what a talking point that is going to prove to be at the end of the match
[6748.74 - 6755.46] P:1653.75 E:0.032390 |  What a talking point urs meyers performance will be as well as the referee long ball into the england half philip neville doesn't get it
[6755.46 - 6760.18] P:1631.34 E:0.032363 |  First time maybe that will inspire england forward if they feel that they've been hard done by here
[6760.50 - 6765.46] P:1624.26 E:0.035674 |  The ball now needs clearing by john terry and he knocks it a long way into the crowd over on the far side
[6765.70 - 6771.78] P:1702.77 E:0.033246 |  It's portugal won england won and we're playing added time at the end of the 90 minutes three minutes of added time
[6772.18 - 6776.82] P:1659.13 E:0.033968 |  Now england have to be careful themselves. They thought they'd won the game if portugal get a goal now
[6776.98 - 6778.82] P:1566.58 E:0.031701 |  It will be all over
[6778.82 - 6780.34] P:1628.54 E:0.031972 |  The ball is with the
[6780.34 - 6784.82] P:1613.49 E:0.034103 |  Costa long ball to this near side the field to deco deco is now playing wide on the right

[6798.34 - 6800.98] P:1697.74 E:0.040936 |  Still hargreeves are in ahead of him and he loses his footing
[6801.46 - 6804.90] P:1835.08 E:0.037788 |  Well, he was fouled two or three times there as he tried to get forward
[6805.62 - 6809.14] P:1817.34 E:0.033373 |  And now hargreeves gets up slowly and portugal counterattack
[6809.54 - 6814.18] P:1742.26 E:0.036185 |  Lampard and coal switched in field and the referee's given a free kick now against lampard

[6825.30 - 6827.30] P:1721.13 E:0.032981 |  Gomez and postigar ahead of him
[6827.54 - 6832.34] P:1619.38 E:0.036436 |  Portugal keeping the ball with ruy costa england thought they'd won it with a minute to go from cambo

[6839.54 - 6843.06] P:1727.05 E:0.034797 |  And it's going to be a portuguese throw that can hardly be any seconds left
[6843.30 - 6849.22] P:1843.47 E:0.033238 |  And spenior and ericsson will have to come on soon with steve mclaran samy lee to lift the england team for extra time
[6850.26 - 6852.26] P:1731.17 E:0.032294 |  throw to portugal far side
[6852.74 - 6856.50] P:1677.86 E:0.032920 |  Postigar the goal scorer comes towards the ball the cross comes in
[6857.06 - 6859.06] P:1636.22 E:0.036286 |  Looking for nuno Gomez with a weak header
[6859.54 - 6864.58] P:1753.76 E:0.034083 |  That's gone wide and the signs since equal england conceded the goal have been reasonably encouraging
[6864.90 - 6869.94] P:1669.30 E:0.029833 |  And that they haven't fallen apart here and they've given quite a good account of themselves over the last five minutes
[6870.10 - 6874.42] P:1534.93 E:0.030739 |  Yeah, that was well played from here. There's a great free kick from beckham here. Camel up in the air
[6874.42 - 6880.26] P:1718.92 E:0.036939 |  But back come portugal slow to react beckham should have got that and the shot is driven in by portugal over the bar
[6880.82 - 6886.42] P:1685.62 E:0.033704 |  But what is beckham thinking about that really needed more commitment england captain screaming at gary neville?
[6886.42 - 6890.02] P:1830.46 E:0.033633 |  I'm not sure why whistle goes for the end of the 90 minutes
[6890.82 - 6892.58] P:1861.08 E:0.034164 |  we will have
[6892.58 - 6899.38] P:1855.73 E:0.034990 |  Extra time we're not quite sure how much extra time because of course the silver goals will apply steve mclaran is the first man on the pitch

[6901.70 - 6905.22] P:1807.91 E:0.032552 |  We've got extra time as one or two of us always expect who we might have here
[6905.54 - 6907.22] P:1643.56 E:0.032362 |  Score here england one portugal one
[6907.22 - 6913.06] P:1922.63 E:0.030882 |  Let's just remind you of the rules any team leading after the first 15 minutes of extra time is declared the winner
[6913.38 - 6918.50] P:1734.02 E:0.032472 |  So they will play the 15 minutes whatever even if someone scores they will carry on and play the 15 minutes

[6980.82 - 6984.02] P:1718.68 E:0.030949 |  Over ricardo the portuguese goalkeeper and the linesman gave it
[6984.34 - 6988.90] P:1558.03 E:0.028567 |  Okay, I mean it's very easy isn't it for us to say what is important now mark?
[6989.14 - 6993.38] P:1609.35 E:0.028533 |  We can talk about that but down there looking at spengar and ericsson going around his players
[6993.78 - 6998.82] P:1466.31 E:0.031961 |  You really have got it. You're not going to change that what is vital for these players at the moment minds are cleared
[6999.30 - 7003.54] P:1704.05 E:0.031773 |  Into except you're still in this game. This game is there still to be won
[7004.02 - 7006.98] P:1492.13 E:0.029152 |  What's happened has happened you've got to put that out of the mind
[7007.30 - 7009.38] P:1585.82 E:0.029040 |  And even if i doubt whether they're talking about it
[7009.54 - 7013.38] P:1522.11 E:0.029618 |  But you've got to stop them talking about it and get on with it from our point of view
[7013.70 - 7020.66] P:1574.93 E:0.030195 |  It looked initially a very clean goal having looked at it later on you do see terry impeding the goalkeeper
[7020.74 - 7025.22] P:1714.64 E:0.030989 |  I thought for a second we were going to have arson tina at 98 all over again because the referee
[7025.78 - 7030.42] P:1588.88 E:0.030870 |  Allowed them well, i'm not even sure they did take a free kick. Did they seem to almost surprise anything about it?
[7030.58 - 7033.46] P:1609.17 E:0.029258 |  Well, they must have taken a free kick. Well, he's gone in there. No, I didn't see anything
[7033.54 - 7035.54] P:1437.69 E:0.034613 |  We did because the ball seemed to be well away
[7035.78 - 7038.82] P:1557.58 E:0.029100 |  But they must have taken it out of the net put it down and gone on with it
[7039.14 - 7045.14] P:1754.36 E:0.028107 |  The portuguese equalizer talk us through it from your expert point of view in terms of the defending and john terry in particular
[7045.22 - 7049.54] P:1696.93 E:0.030731 |  He thinks out, you know, I think john terry has come on to his game very much in the in the second half
[7049.54 - 7050.66] P:1325.58 E:0.031011 |  I was having a very good game
[7050.74 - 7056.02] P:1574.44 E:0.029372 |  I thought he started slowly but when the ball went out to the flank position after the first cross had been knocked
[7056.42 - 7059.62] P:1559.19 E:0.035676 |  There was no looking round by him to see where players were
[7060.18 - 7066.18] P:1498.69 E:0.028334 |  And in fact what happened then postiga came in and sol camber got two players near him and pot
[7066.18 - 7069.54] P:1570.81 E:0.029680 |  It came over john terry's head and we're just looking at it again
[7069.54 - 7072.98] P:1504.22 E:0.029216 |  and you'll see actually the look round and it comes over and and
[7073.62 - 7077.38] P:1705.13 E:0.025633 |  Sol looked at him. Is that that's what you call in the trade just ball watching
[7077.38 - 7083.86] P:1511.42 E:0.032718 |  I'm saying that he ball watched a lot. He didn't look round enough to see where the danger was because whilst the ball's out in the flank
[7083.86 - 7087.46] P:1431.16 E:0.026793 |  It's no threat. The threat is what's about you? Where are the players?
[7087.62 - 7092.02] P:1509.57 E:0.026379 |  So you have to have a look and see what's happening and I have to say that john didn't do that
[7092.50 - 7095.62] P:1908.12 E:0.027741 |  Well, we're just seeing a replay again of the hit some right at the end
[7096.10 - 7098.90] P:1737.21 E:0.028816 |  And it's happened in real time head on to the crossbar now
[7098.90 - 7104.10] P:1737.49 E:0.027560 |  Let's try and talk you through it at home and john terry definitely has his left arm over the goalkeeper's shoulder
[7104.98 - 7108.26] P:1801.57 E:0.027601 |  And the goalkeeper's made sure he's gone down. All right, the lineman's given it
[7108.34 - 7111.14] P:1606.78 E:0.026025 |  I mean, some people would say that the referees are a protected species
[7111.14 - 7115.38] P:1715.78 E:0.025705 |  You know, not even the dodo had the protection the goalkeepers have but it's the same both ends
[7115.38 - 7117.06] P:1701.30 E:0.032104 |  Is that what we have to say? Yeah, look at it again
[7117.06 - 7123.14] P:1360.62 E:0.027509 |  Of course the lineman and the referee don't have the advantage that we have and he's jumping and he's hands it
[7123.22 - 7127.62] P:1465.68 E:0.028531 |  And it does come down on the keeper. He doesn't leave himself up off the keeper
[7127.62 - 7129.78] P:1363.12 E:0.032447 |  So I think we're a little bit unfortunate
[7130.34 - 7133.94] P:1510.42 E:0.033308 |  Be very interested to see what would have happened if it had been goal the at the other end
[7133.94 - 7134.82] P:1669.39 E:0.023766 |  Terry Butcher
[7134.82 - 7137.14] P:1383.71 E:0.029421 |  When the ball hits the crossbar and it goes up in the air
[7137.22 - 7140.74] P:1449.56 E:0.030635 |  Both cambell and terry have their eyes fixed on the ball to try and attempt the ball
[7140.82 - 7143.94] P:1564.68 E:0.029654 |  In fact cambell comes over to top of terry and heads it in the back of the net
[7143.94 - 7146.42] P:1604.27 E:0.033348 |  I don't think john terry deliberately obstructs the goalkeeper
[7146.58 - 7149.46] P:1629.45 E:0.029952 |  I think the goalkeeper makes a complete hash of it flaps at it
[7149.54 - 7152.66] P:1499.14 E:0.029230 |  And the referee makes a complete hash of it in my opinion and this allows the goal
[7152.82 - 7156.50] P:1778.52 E:0.029348 |  Graham, how will england how should england approach this first 15 minutes?
[7156.66 - 7158.98] P:1708.33 E:0.033586 |  Well it now is a question is that you're in the game
[7159.38 - 7162.90] P:1341.23 E:0.030977 |  It's you will have chances and what you've got to do you've got to
[7163.38 - 7166.90] P:1453.47 E:0.034439 |  When I say take the game to them you've got to make sure that we play more of the game
[7167.30 - 7169.78] P:1481.70 E:0.031933 |  If it's a tall possible in the portuguese half
[7170.10 - 7172.98] P:1578.71 E:0.032894 |  We're not going to get anything unless it's just a breakaway now
[7173.30 - 7176.74] P:1338.71 E:0.030799 |  By in fact allowing the portuguese to have so much possession of the ball
[7176.90 - 7181.62] P:1435.86 E:0.033744 |  What I will say when I couldn't quite see what scolaria done. He's done very very well
[7181.62 - 7184.82] P:1392.99 E:0.029974 |  I tell you he's gone for it and decos played in three positions
[7184.82 - 7189.06] P:1412.44 E:0.030222 |  You could argue he's playing it right back now, but he's actually pushed postiga in with
[7190.02 - 7195.38] P:1358.86 E:0.031576 |  Gomez and actually he has gone for the game. So give them credit. They probably deserve the equalizer
[7195.70 - 7200.66] P:1814.36 E:0.027359 |  Ersmire has just tossed the coin again because you do toss up again for extra time at england
[7200.66 - 7204.18] P:1770.10 E:0.026970 |  They're going to play the way they were in the first half. It's going to be 15 minutes
[7204.26 - 7208.82] P:1871.07 E:0.027851 |  Whatever happens however many goals allen green describes it will be 15 minutes allen
[7210.02 - 7212.50] P:1683.25 E:0.036143 |  They've gone 334 portugal. That's what they've done
[7213.46 - 7221.78] P:1793.06 E:0.032259 |  Excuse my voice a bit hoarse having a certain might of shouting at the referee, but I think unfortunately Campbell's goal was rightly disaligned
[7222.50 - 7224.50] P:1926.65 E:0.030807 |  Terry filed the goalkeeper
[7225.70 - 7229.06] P:1738.92 E:0.034303 |  No golden goal remember that applied four years ago and eight years ago
[7229.70 - 7234.66] P:1834.03 E:0.028966 |  A silver goal means that if a team take the lead an extra time and hold on to that lead
[7235.22 - 7239.38] P:1712.11 E:0.026572 |  Uh until after 15 minutes have been played that will be the final score
[7240.34 - 7243.78] P:1545.24 E:0.030629 |  Uh the ball is out of play on the far side of the field. It's going to be a throw into england
[7244.74 - 7246.34] P:1799.37 E:0.018927 |  Disrevised
[7246.34 - 7249.70] P:1649.79 E:0.026008 |  England line up though the formation remains substantially the same
[7250.42 - 7252.42] P:1717.04 E:0.029315 |  Hargreaves takes a throw towards the cell
[7253.14 - 7254.98] P:1619.27 E:0.021360 |  Knocked away and there's
[7254.98 - 7258.42] P:1537.21 E:0.028656 |  Campbell heading it forward again called back heels the ball doesn't reach
[7258.98 - 7265.54] P:1576.70 E:0.027447 |  Derrius for sell and then lampard in there but dives in there and doesn't get the ball and it's driven forward
[7265.86 - 7272.18] P:1746.63 E:0.024726 |  Deep bounces inside the six not the six yard box the d of the england penalty area and through to david james
[7273.86 - 7275.62] P:1696.00 E:0.016879 |  My james
[7275.62 - 7280.26] P:1604.07 E:0.028370 |  Well, he made one excellent save from figo shot that was deflected. There were a couple of early moments that went dark clever
[7280.98 - 7288.66] P:1622.01 E:0.027578 |  It's one one here in lisbon and no one seriously can deny that portugal deserved to equalize the momentum was with them
[7288.90 - 7294.18] P:1684.42 E:0.024366 |  Throughout the second half all the pressure was on england james slices of clearance
[7294.90 - 7302.18] P:1529.22 E:0.024304 |  It doesn't even reach the halfway line. Terry has the ball died and there's an offside flag raised against postiga
[7303.38 - 7304.34] P:1658.51 E:0.016219 |  england
[7304.34 - 7306.34] P:1613.06 E:0.022720 |  Have the ball and the free kick
[7306.34 - 7313.14] P:1686.20 E:0.026778 |  Terry lashes it towards michael oan the card of cavaleo heads it away hargreaves is there hargreaves faced by
[7313.70 - 7317.78] P:1619.56 E:0.027304 |  Deco who's playing right midfield now and then hargreaves on comes forward deco
[7318.18 - 7323.62] P:1648.27 E:0.030008 |  Tackles and beats him and here's christiana ronaldo up over the halfway line and he's still running forward
[7324.74 - 7327.86] P:1780.40 E:0.034718 |  That's gonna be a yellow card. I suspect filing his club colleague
[7328.74 - 7332.10] P:1806.80 E:0.030059 |  And ursmire loves to flash the yellow in english faces
[7332.74 - 7336.74] P:1528.92 E:0.029143 |  Yeah, he's definitely right on that occasion ronaldo picked the ball up and hargreaves are giving the ball away
[7336.74 - 7339.94] P:1590.03 E:0.027302 |  But um ronaldo was faced with ashley colin fill never pushed it past
[7340.18 - 7344.42] P:1635.50 E:0.030697 |  Ashleigh coler fill never slid in didn't make contact with the ball foul ronaldo definitely
[7344.90 - 7348.02] P:1635.12 E:0.031483 |  Looking and it's a free kick at a chance for the forties to get men in the box
[7348.58 - 7350.58] P:1556.03 E:0.031698 |  Wide on the touch line on the right hand side
[7351.38 - 7354.02] P:1723.62 E:0.028687 |  Deco's gonna take it re costa lurking ominously
[7354.66 - 7358.42] P:1604.61 E:0.028181 |  On the d the edge of the d the england penalty here comes decos free kick not a great one
[7358.66 - 7363.38] P:1762.98 E:0.029312 |  Had it died to re costa re costa shot almost ronaldo the flags up for offside
[7364.66 - 7366.66] P:1479.61 E:0.024901 |  And just coming out on the edge of the box here and uh
[7367.46 - 7370.34] P:1474.35 E:0.026475 |  I'm too sure was it pastiga that caught it ronaldo caught it but uh
[7370.58 - 7374.82] P:1537.33 E:0.027599 |  Two players offside when the good clearance from england's point of view, but that was a scary moment
[7374.90 - 7377.62] P:1588.84 E:0.031546 |  Well, well done deras for south keeping that ball and playing the fire
[7377.62 - 7382.02] P:1543.28 E:0.029278 |  Well, I thought he kept it in play by ronjama long way away in the linesman could look along the line
[7382.02 - 7384.66] P:1490.46 E:0.025594 |  He says no he didn't and it's a throw into portugal
[7385.54 - 7388.26] P:1695.69 E:0.029613 |  Yeah, will there be caution in this situation terry?
[7388.90 - 7392.42] P:1581.96 E:0.028624 |  No, you just have to go for it if he possibly can you know that if you if you score the goal
[7392.42 - 7395.14] P:1556.71 E:0.025025 |  It's still got to go the 15 minutes in that first period
[7395.22 - 7398.98] P:1405.47 E:0.026759 |  Of course if you if it's no nil then at one no goals then it still goes to the
[7399.54 - 7405.14] P:1634.92 E:0.029073 |  The full distance of 120 minutes. So it's a bit cat and mouse. Uh david beckham surely brought down and there was uh
[7406.10 - 7411.94] P:1714.93 E:0.026339 |  A little boot towards beckham, but it's a free kick beckham takes it finds michael oan just outside the penalty area
[7412.10 - 7414.66] P:1677.20 E:0.030969 |  oan having to retreat though and that's not good from oan
[7415.38 - 7417.38] P:1835.41 E:0.031506 |  It's taken up now for portugal
[7418.02 - 7423.22] P:1686.66 E:0.028905 |  And here's postiga the goal scorer stepping inside fill level. He can't make another bar tackle
[7423.54 - 7426.98] P:1636.08 E:0.029160 |  The pass goes to ronaldo engles ashley cold winning it fairly
[7427.38 - 7432.02] P:1659.48 E:0.027782 |  Campbell heads it away beckham's not going to restart step forward again by portugal outcomes james
[7432.18 - 7437.94] P:1752.34 E:0.024480 |  And he catches that ball. We've already played three and a half minutes of the first 15 minutes of extra time
[7438.74 - 7441.94] P:1683.91 E:0.029368 |  We might not need 30, but we might have to get 30 and
[7442.66 - 7444.66] P:1903.07 E:0.034858 |  then heaven help us
[7445.86 - 7451.06] P:2048.82 E:0.033232 |  The ball is still with javid james. I think england actually recovered well having considered equalizer terry
[7451.06 - 7455.70] P:1763.50 E:0.028533 |  Yeah, they have um when when portugal went for it and applying the three at the back and three and they're feeling four up
[7456.02 - 7459.22] P:1458.29 E:0.026388 |  Never says, you know, you sort of think well, it's a very very wide open game in the house
[7459.54 - 7462.74] P:1438.90 E:0.031889 |  They're vulnerable then to one ball over the top four oan and four of a cell but
[7463.38 - 7466.74] P:1585.65 E:0.026238 |  You know, they just have to sometimes try and alter that shape if they possibly can portugal
[7466.74 - 7471.78] P:1576.33 E:0.031933 |  But I think both teams are going for it deco looking for an alder and alder broke forward too quickly and he's offside
[7472.18 - 7477.06] P:1709.04 E:0.026795 |  But wearing the lampard gave the ball away there another carelessly england mustn't do that
[7477.70 - 7481.46] P:1696.37 E:0.026094 |  Free kick to england four minutes gone an extra time here in lisbon
[7481.54 - 7485.70] P:1728.90 E:0.024388 |  It's one one between the host portugal and england beckham's on the right side
[7485.70 - 7489.06] P:1571.04 E:0.028185 |  He was manhandled there by an inner valente the ball goes out of play
[7489.14 - 7492.10] P:1685.36 E:0.027501 |  That's a throw in to england when it could easily have been a free kick
[7492.66 - 7493.62] P:1739.41 E:0.017616 |  Beckham
[7493.62 - 7495.62] P:1794.64 E:0.028643 |  They're not unreasonably looks exhausted
[7496.02 - 7498.02] P:1876.07 E:0.027387 |  This could be his moment
[7498.02 - 7500.02] P:1905.85 E:0.028872 |  This could be his moment
[7500.26 - 7501.54] P:1964.97 E:0.024767 |  Throw in
[7501.54 - 7505.54] P:1780.41 E:0.029139 |  For england taken by gary neville to fill neville back to gary neville neville
[7505.62 - 7509.38] P:1754.70 E:0.028785 |  Squeeze the ball through legs of some mile back to fill neville fill neville's cross slightly deflected
[7509.54 - 7516.02] P:1679.91 E:0.027262 |  Headed clear for cell brings it down new to valente clears fill level rises heads it further forward and downed by vacelle
[7516.02 - 7520.18] P:1708.66 E:0.024846 |  But he's the judge to have filed the defender and rari and it's a freak you could portugal
[7520.18 - 7522.82] P:1757.98 E:0.023172 |  It's a very scrappy first five minutes of extra time
[7522.90 - 7525.70] P:1421.12 E:0.026261 |  I think I think all sets of both sets of players are pretty tired
[7525.70 - 7528.74] P:1446.07 E:0.029056 |  They put a lot of effort into it as a good tempo to the game. It was very open
[7528.74 - 7532.10] P:1688.66 E:0.030117 |  Wasn't it was end to end football in the 90 minutes and both
[7532.66 - 7536.82] P:1700.40 E:0.029225 |  Both sets of players deserve a great deal of plays for their for their stamina, but
[7537.78 - 7539.78] P:1757.34 E:0.023208 |  With tiredness comes mistakes
[7539.86 - 7544.34] P:1686.01 E:0.029959 |  Ricardo with a free kick up to the edge of the england penalty area good header away by terry
[7544.98 - 7547.38] P:1699.93 E:0.029959 |  And it's a throw into portugal midway inside
[7547.78 - 7553.46] P:1646.25 E:0.027205 |  The england half left for nuno valente to take back. It goes to rui costa rui costa onto his
[7554.02 - 7556.58] P:1666.67 E:0.028761 |  Right foot and he slides it away to the far side and
[7557.22 - 7562.82] P:1626.58 E:0.029780 |  englander back defending again as deco put the ball into the penalty well chested down in there by nunogomas
[7562.82 - 7567.14] P:1740.05 E:0.028936 |  But he couldn't get the shot in rui costa flicks it forward again. Here's danger for england
[7567.22 - 7571.70] P:1760.87 E:0.034670 |  Howl was that a handball terry went across and may have snucked him up the face either way
[7571.70 - 7575.54] P:1761.81 E:0.025851 |  It's behind for a gold kick and not a penalty for a corner kick mother not a penalty
[7575.86 - 7579.54] P:1743.41 E:0.024758 |  Yeah, I'm not too sure if it does strike John terry it hits him right on the nose
[7580.90 - 7584.66] P:1504.91 E:0.027230 |  How they can complain on appeal for that? I just don't know but sometimes you might get it. You never know
[7584.82 - 7589.94] P:1722.45 E:0.028452 |  This is five live bringing you extra time from lisbon portugal and england one one corner to portugal
[7590.02 - 7593.62] P:1657.50 E:0.030474 |  And it's headed on there in the edge of the six yard box headed away by phil neville
[7594.02 - 7596.26] P:1644.76 E:0.025809 |  Drops the deco deco crosses into the box
[7596.58 - 7599.46] P:1584.27 E:0.029685 |  Campbell with a header down beckham needs to get there beckham does get there
[7599.70 - 7602.42] P:1655.53 E:0.028732 |  Well done skipper and he hits it over the halfway line
[7602.66 - 7607.22] P:1631.98 E:0.028506 |  Michael oan is the only england player chasing after it and he had to give up in the end because nuno valente
[7607.70 - 7610.02] P:1642.18 E:0.029906 |  Had an easy header back to his goalkeeper ricardo
[7610.90 - 7612.50] P:1718.19 E:0.018308 |  They looked out
[7612.50 - 7617.06] P:1509.80 E:0.027367 |  They looked out. Yeah, both sets of players looked starting they can't build from the back because they've got four attackers to mark
[7617.06 - 7622.02] P:1510.06 E:0.027296 |  So it's got to be hurry clearances. It's got to be wall slashes when they can get balls into midfield players as they're doing now
[7622.18 - 7627.54] P:1533.42 E:0.029218 |  Then they can pass it, but they don't haven't passed it well in this period. That was pure from lampard, but hard grease wins it back
[7627.54 - 7628.74] P:1692.38 E:0.034220 |  but not
[7628.74 - 7629.54] P:1837.16 E:0.032772 |  england
[7629.54 - 7631.14] P:1809.97 E:0.032040 |  class holder
[7631.14 - 7633.70] P:1802.52 E:0.028079 |  heads in their hands as the referee are smart
[7634.26 - 7637.70] P:1663.04 E:0.024097 |  whistles again and gives another free kick against england
[7638.66 - 7643.70] P:1731.94 E:0.026353 |  It's taken and played to the left to maniche and i ru costa inside the center circle
[7643.70 - 7650.18] P:1678.82 E:0.026502 |  He should be quite fresh ru costa looks for samarro another as the substitution is made by scolari samarro
[7650.50 - 7655.38] P:1686.11 E:0.029974 |  Up to the edge of the england penalty just across in maniche was there good header away by terry
[7655.62 - 7660.50] P:1808.57 E:0.029008 |  And it's taken up by lampard oan's down the lap for cells through the middle the pass is short
[7660.98 - 7668.98] P:1902.44 E:0.030553 |  And to hargree's now it's on to michael oan back to hargree's on the halfway line hargree's loose forward and falls over and that was no free kick
[7669.94 - 7677.38] P:1757.57 E:0.025398 |  Now it's forward and postiga hits it to the right and taken up by young ronaldo ronaldo midway inside the england half
[7677.78 - 7679.94] P:1770.98 E:0.029514 |  dives why why isn't he booked for that?
[7680.82 - 7685.22] P:1700.69 E:0.028400 |  Fill level clears anyway high towards michael oan headed away by carvalho
[7685.46 - 7689.94] P:1695.86 E:0.028507 |  Here's ronaldo again. Now fill level gets in a fair challenge once more, but it's back with deco
[7690.82 - 7695.06] P:1711.59 E:0.028408 |  Seven and a half minutes gone halfway through the first period of extra time here on five live
[7695.46 - 7700.82] P:1718.77 E:0.028967 |  Samal 25 yards. I comes forward runs into david backham then it's starved back where he costa
[7701.94 - 7707.22] P:1850.65 E:0.034102 |  And he dives and that's surely should be a yellow car. That was new lugoma is actually who died
[7708.10 - 7712.90] P:1795.97 E:0.030109 |  But i mean that's ridiculous. I wonder if referee is going to caution new lugomas when the ball goes out of play but uh
[7713.86 - 7716.66] P:1506.19 E:0.026127 |  No, that's that would unbelievable simulation there unbelievable
[7717.14 - 7719.14] P:1752.17 E:0.027426 |  But he should have won a free kick and book a plan
[7719.54 - 7722.26] P:1733.63 E:0.021280 |  Uh carvalho for portugal
[7722.90 - 7726.42] P:1676.40 E:0.027921 |  Uh to deco ronaldo's ahead of him deco's looking further forward though
[7726.42 - 7730.74] P:1741.20 E:0.029047 |  And that's a great ball struck to the left towards samal taken on his chest gary neville's in there
[7730.90 - 7736.66] P:1725.01 E:0.029581 |  The pass in though towards the edge of the penalty new lugomas the back heals the ball taken up by rui costa
[7736.82 - 7740.34] P:1684.71 E:0.028885 |  He's tackled fairly tackled by lampard rui costa those towards the ball
[7740.90 - 7744.18] P:1734.05 E:0.030794 |  Gives it to samal samal edge of the penalty inside the penalty
[7744.58 - 7748.90] P:1715.44 E:0.033905 |  Should slow that was a shot and go rebounds to deco deco with a drive into the penalty area
[7748.98 - 7752.18] P:1605.19 E:0.030589 |  An england body blocks it and lampard plays it away to hargree
[7753.22 - 7758.98] P:1788.25 E:0.028811 |  Hargree's looking for the run of michael oan the girass for sell plays the ball between them and it's headed back
[7758.98 - 7762.58] P:1728.72 E:0.030300 |  By a combination of andrade and caballo to ricardo
[7762.66 - 7767.46] P:1549.14 E:0.034385 |  That's all in that's all england can do when they get the ball at the back is to hoof it forward because they're under pressure at the back
[7767.46 - 7773.22] P:1547.50 E:0.032571 |  There's no spare men when they do play it forward. It's got to be the right ball for oan and basel, but unfortunately it's not been so far
[7774.18 - 7777.14] P:1803.67 E:0.028960 |  Portugal looked more constructive of the two teams an extra time
[7777.94 - 7782.74] P:1637.47 E:0.024290 |  He's money shall the halfway line finding deco once more down the right
[7783.14 - 7786.34] P:1664.95 E:0.024997 |  He's such a great first 90 minutes deco back to maniche
[7786.90 - 7790.42] P:1562.92 E:0.032232 |  And then new neville anti is available down this near flight the portuguese left
[7790.50 - 7793.54] P:1668.47 E:0.031904 |  He overheats it and then he brings back him down. That's a free kick
[7795.94 - 7797.94] P:1843.70 E:0.024513 |  Free kick to england
[7798.02 - 7800.02] P:1792.08 E:0.030286 |  You just got just worry, you know that
[7800.98 - 7802.98] P:1650.99 E:0.031166 |  I don't want to accuse the referee of that
[7803.38 - 7808.34] P:1650.29 E:0.030368 |  Leaning to one side, but you do get the feeling that he would he would yellow card an england player for that tackle
[7808.42 - 7812.98] P:1874.24 E:0.030088 |  And doesn't yellow card the portuguese player? Well, you know, you know, go may just threw himself to the ground as well
[7813.06 - 7815.06] P:1995.52 E:0.032594 |  That was worthy of a yellow card in its own
[7815.22 - 7821.86] P:1948.63 E:0.031334 |  In uifren fever trying to clamp down this but that was just unbelievably blatant gary neville's free kick hit towards versal versal
[7821.86 - 7825.94] P:1756.66 E:0.031222 |  Went down far too easily balls out of play after as for sell throwing to portugal
[7826.26 - 7828.58] P:1797.62 E:0.031955 |  And here's maniche who still looks right. He doesn't
[7829.06 - 7834.82] P:1674.50 E:0.032723 |  Maniche coming forward towards the halfway line now inside the center circle plays it to ronaldo down the portuguese right
[7835.14 - 7839.06] P:1757.67 E:0.034283 |  Cole dives in and wins the ball and it actually came off ronaldo
[7839.22 - 7843.86] P:1761.42 E:0.033706 |  The linesman gave the throw in towards portugal and ursmash says no, that's an england throwing
[7845.38 - 7846.74] P:2075.28 E:0.024796 |  well
[7846.74 - 7849.22] P:1887.03 E:0.030463 |  once again the referee and the linesman fall out about this one and
[7850.42 - 7853.46] P:1649.45 E:0.029981 |  You know, it's good for it as well. Just to slow it down a little bit actually Cole
[7853.46 - 7855.94] P:1652.01 E:0.029123 |  I would say and michael owen of any of the two best players
[7856.58 - 7861.54] P:1660.94 E:0.029884 |  Here's phil neville after the throw in to owen owen brings it down well good play michael owen
[7861.70 - 7865.38] P:1638.10 E:0.028047 |  Bringing gary neville into the game up to the halfway line neville beckham
[7865.86 - 7873.30] P:1770.61 E:0.027647 |  Is captain is ahead of him, but it's in the brother phil and now lampard better from england lampard midway inside the portuguese half
[7873.86 - 7880.02] P:1838.68 E:0.030836 |  Finds owen hargree's hargree's cross deep looking for the header of beckham beckham on a half chance there head of white
[7880.58 - 7882.34] P:1724.73 E:0.032062 |  Yes, nunna valenti was all over the shop
[7882.34 - 7887.22] P:1428.20 E:0.032287 |  It was a good ball from owen hargree's from the left wing with his right foot cutting towards the far post beckham came in
[7887.22 - 7889.62] P:1489.52 E:0.028888 |  Owen was underneath it as well beckham's header
[7890.26 - 7895.86] P:1603.95 E:0.031373 |  Well, he guided it down, but just past ricardo's left hand post. It was a difficult chance if anything else, but there was a half chance
[7897.14 - 7899.78] P:1711.93 E:0.033161 |  He got the feeling it was a header back across goal that might have got in
[7899.86 - 7903.78] P:1491.33 E:0.033524 |  Well, I think owen and nunna valenti were coming back on the back and he couldn't really have a clear sight at it
[7903.78 - 7907.06] P:1586.69 E:0.030469 |  But he did hit it down but off target. No silver goal as yet
[7907.06 - 7914.26] P:1679.60 E:0.027233 |  We've got four minutes left in the first period of extra time. We might need to fool 30 minutes, but here's somehow for portugal somehow
[7915.06 - 7919.38] P:1715.38 E:0.031819 |  Dixon into the penalty. He's a jesmerine costa brilliant block by camber costa goes there
[7919.54 - 7922.50] P:1853.17 E:0.029974 |  He should block by terry and terry was hurt there
[7922.90 - 7925.06] P:1785.80 E:0.028946 |  But it's taken away by hargree's and again
[7925.06 - 7930.18] P:1822.17 E:0.029880 |  There's a huge gap between the england midfield and the two england strikers hargree's plays it to the right
[7930.34 - 7933.14] P:1762.94 E:0.028311 |  owen keeps it in play and then he plays it off the
[7933.38 - 7935.38] P:1815.40 E:0.030722 |  Portuguese left back nunna valenti
[7935.62 - 7937.78] P:1694.87 E:0.029784 |  And that's as well as owen could have done a new circumstances
[7937.78 - 7938.58] P:1451.71 E:0.033185 |  He'd be very well in england

[7972.50 - 7974.74] P:1488.32 E:0.033424 |  Well, he's playing more right back now than right back field
[7974.74 - 7978.74] P:1711.35 E:0.027923 |  He's in the right hand side midfield and having to drop back when he can but they're still adventurous from the portugese
[7979.30 - 7981.78] P:1865.81 E:0.031439 |  And it's sometimes slipping to a 4-4-2 now
[7982.26 - 7986.18] P:1874.04 E:0.032094 |  The adventure's gone to a certain degree, but when they do attack they do get a lot of bodies forward

[8119.06 - 8122.10] P:1692.64 E:0.027749 |  It's only a throw and deco to take it mere seconds left
[8122.66 - 8126.18] P:1641.00 E:0.029417 |  At the end of the first period of extra time the throw goes towards rinaldo
[8126.26 - 8131.22] P:1688.99 E:0.028636 |  It was intercepted there by hargree's and hargree's clear and i'll tell you what we didn't even get the 15 minutes
[8131.46 - 8138.26] P:1770.24 E:0.028749 |  There's the half time but we're solved in extra time and we've got at least 15 more minutes and who knows after that
[8138.34 - 8142.66] P:1527.88 E:0.030869 |  Well, i was pleased actually with the effort from england's towards the end the last five minutes of that first half
[8143.38 - 8146.90] P:1403.19 E:0.029210 |  Of extra time that first period england were very much on top and uh, you know
[8146.90 - 8150.26] P:1327.78 E:0.029405 |  Create one or two reasonable chances the beckham had a coming in at the far post
[8150.74 - 8152.34] P:1511.34 E:0.026545 |  Both sets of players look dead on their feet
[8152.42 - 8157.22] P:1591.31 E:0.026954 |  But they've got to summon up the reserves from somewhere because after this game the winners of this match
[8157.22 - 8161.86] P:1657.75 E:0.028708 |  Have got a six day rest before the semi-final. I think that was a brave 15 minutes from england
[8162.26 - 8164.26] P:1805.49 E:0.032359 |  Far better frankly than i was hoping for
[8164.90 - 8166.90] P:1931.05 E:0.032807 |  So michael are you ready?
[8168.90 - 8170.26] P:1972.36 E:0.034115 |  Almost
[8170.26 - 8171.22] P:2017.52 E:0.028976 |  Almost
[8171.22 - 8174.82] P:1854.46 E:0.031792 |  I wonder whether we can just get a quick word with graham taylor because the players although they are start
[8175.06 - 8178.90] P:1776.99 E:0.025661 |  They are supposed to restart straight away. They're having some refreshment
[8179.46 - 8180.66] P:1645.45 E:0.028808 |  And graham, what do you think?
[8180.66 - 8184.42] P:1532.15 E:0.031146 |  Well from england's point of view the last three or four minutes it shows that you can control it
[8184.66 - 8189.46] P:1411.35 E:0.033578 |  You can pose a threat. I have to say this looking at the portuguese side in possession
[8189.46 - 8194.82] P:1364.08 E:0.034548 |  You know, they're playing 244 they push on and deco out of possession
[8194.98 - 8201.70] P:1502.30 E:0.037409 |  They're into a 4 4 2 but certainly in possession. You've got a 244 in international football. It's amazing
[8202.42 - 8204.42] P:1729.52 E:0.032121 |  No times change
[8205.14 - 8206.98] P:1802.93 E:0.035654 |  Well, david beckham's
[8206.98 - 8208.98] P:1935.86 E:0.031905 |  out on his knees has been
[8209.06 - 8210.58] P:1855.78 E:0.033927 |  a lot of
[8210.58 - 8213.46] P:1866.37 E:0.032864 |  Stuff talked about his fitness level at the end of the season with ray on the drip
[8214.42 - 8215.86] P:1938.67 E:0.032547 |  So portugal will
[8215.86 - 8217.86] P:1870.71 E:0.033870 |  Start this final period of extra time
[8218.42 - 8222.02] P:1842.92 E:0.030324 |  Remember there's never been a silver goal yet to decide a european championship game
[8222.66 - 8224.66] P:1710.04 E:0.023442 |  It's been golden goals
[8224.66 - 8230.66] P:1666.44 E:0.026958 |  Before and of course portugal went out of euro 2000 to a golden goal a penalty scored by zidane in the semi-final
[8230.66 - 8232.26] P:1685.78 E:0.020778 |  There was all sorts of
[8232.26 - 8234.26] P:1728.95 E:0.022940 |  Acrimony at the end of that game
[8234.58 - 8240.90] P:1792.67 E:0.030475 |  One one after 90 minutes still one one after the first 50 minutes of extra time and the ball is with munich
[8241.38 - 8246.34] P:1584.81 E:0.035056 |  Of portugal england improved in that period but now they have to mark tighter than this
[8246.66 - 8251.78] P:1786.87 E:0.033546 |  It's nuno gomez of portugal nuno gomez towards postiga who kicks fresh air
[8252.42 - 8255.78] P:1834.15 E:0.030117 |  And ashley coal now being urged to clear but showing good composure
[8256.18 - 8261.78] P:1768.73 E:0.028205 |  And eventually slides the ball to oin hargreys near side the field the england left hargreys having problems getting going here
[8262.18 - 8264.90] P:1800.74 E:0.031453 |  Against deco and no linemen's given a throw into portugal
[8265.78 - 8269.46] P:1715.97 E:0.030616 |  Throw in to the portuguese taken already and it's ruy costa of portugal
[8269.86 - 8275.14] P:1695.06 E:0.031397 |  Plays the ball in towards the edge of the area a good step over and a turn there by nuno england need to clear this ball
[8275.30 - 8280.42] P:1754.15 E:0.033198 |  Now there's only they've got messele no in ahead if hargreys can chip it accurately looking for the sell kavaios there gulky
[8280.50 - 8283.14] P:1639.75 E:0.032851 |  But ricardo's out they almost make a mess of that between them
[8283.70 - 8288.98] P:1739.71 E:0.031214 |  And ricardo's still out of his area and then thumps it back into the england hargreys gets good distance on that
[8289.06 - 8291.06] P:1814.36 E:0.030964 |  It's ronaldo against ashley coal
[8291.46 - 8294.98] P:1697.26 E:0.034302 |  Ashley coal gets the better of ronaldo as he has done for large parts of this evening
[8295.46 - 8298.18] P:1899.52 E:0.033034 |  There's a portuguese player nuno gomez lying injured at the moment
[8298.90 - 8305.54] P:1979.14 E:0.034067 |  Scolari what's the game to stop but oin hargreys unaware of that and in fact it wasn't a great ball from him anyway to michael oin
[8306.18 - 8307.70] P:1906.89 E:0.021780 |  and now the game
[8307.70 - 8309.86] P:1793.85 E:0.025940 |  Can't stop if nuno gomez needs attention
[8309.86 - 8316.10] P:1686.80 E:0.025561 |  But I don't want to tempt fate here, but england have looked they've come out and they've looked reasonably strong in extra time so far
[8316.34 - 8318.34] P:1493.34 E:0.031901 |  Until having nuno gomez run the edge of the box
[8318.42 - 8323.46] P:1619.60 E:0.034331 |  He turned to the defenders and shot and it was filled never with a crunch and tackle on the edge of the box
[8323.46 - 8324.98] P:1440.74 E:0.032954 |  And there was one of those ones where
[8324.98 - 8328.74] P:1456.95 E:0.033711 |  Nuno gomez is feeling the pain because he followed through and their fill never was very strong
[8328.74 - 8332.98] P:1463.62 E:0.028238 |  He's uh, gomez is pretty hurt remember the last time england were in a quarter final in this tournament
[8333.54 - 8338.82] P:1745.77 E:0.028081 |  They eventually won through on penalties against spain and here come portugal once more with ronaldo nearside the field
[8339.06 - 8343.54] P:1754.67 E:0.027420 |  ashley coal just backing off ronaldo's going to try and get a cross in ashley coal's got the ball off him

[8350.98 - 8352.98] P:1848.54 E:0.024622 |  As far as possession was concerned
[8353.22 - 8355.22] P:1773.69 E:0.023197 |  Portugal 65 percent
[8355.30 - 8356.50] P:1637.90 E:0.023485 |  england 35 percent
[8356.50 - 8358.90] P:1399.37 E:0.028962 |  Yeah, but i mean how many chances did portugal really great?
[8358.98 - 8361.94] P:1409.46 E:0.030754 |  They had all the ball they had the crossers coming in good defensive from england
[8362.26 - 8366.90] P:1672.16 E:0.030548 |  And then one one bread and butter ball into the box and england slack on the marking and it's a goal
[8367.06 - 8370.02] P:1842.07 E:0.031128 |  england must hope that the portuguese have burnt themselves out here with their
[8370.42 - 8376.18] P:1787.61 E:0.026763 |  Second half assault as david james takes a free kick and it's now with viselle over on the far side of the field

[8415.70 - 8419.46] P:1739.60 E:0.033356 |  Cavio goes forward. There are half a dozen portuguese players now in the area

[8510.98 - 8517.54] P:1551.18 E:0.033236 |  He's bigger he's bigger than a bit part player now because he may have won the match for portugal and got them through to the semi-finals

[8862.82 - 8867.86] P:1820.80 E:0.033100 |  Fortunately, david beckham hasn't been sent off and england may need him to take a penalty in a few minutes time
[8868.26 - 8872.02] P:1772.13 E:0.035306 |  Of course, all that goal does now from lampard. It doesn't win the game for england
[8872.26 - 8876.50] P:1760.52 E:0.031680 |  But it might save it for them and we may move to the lottery of a penalty shootout

[8969.46 - 8971.94] P:1577.42 E:0.033012 |  I think the quicker we get back to you so we can

[8992.02 - 8995.46] P:1734.86 E:0.031186 |  Is if england go out of this tournament meek and marley like they did
[8996.10 - 9003.14] P:1775.83 E:0.031406 |  In japan two years ago, but now england have to really really concentrate with two minutes to go and portugal have a corner

[9114.58 - 9118.26] P:1842.43 E:0.030728 |  He's in the area in goes a corner kick ricardo gets one hand to the ball
[9118.58 - 9122.90] P:1816.59 E:0.031698 |  Lampard will chase ursmire's looked at his watch. We've got three seconds to go
[9124.10 - 9127.22] P:1820.19 E:0.032021 |  And ursmire blows for the final time
[9127.94 - 9129.94] P:1743.55 E:0.024750 |  and england
[9130.18 - 9134.02] P:1740.02 E:0.034584 |  Who experienced penalties and the world cup semi-final of 1990?
[9134.82 - 9137.54] P:1700.39 E:0.033150 |  the european championships twice in 96
[9138.34 - 9140.34] P:1571.65 E:0.034492 |  And lastly in the world cup of 98

[9144.34 - 9146.34] P:1611.49 E:0.026921 |  rest with a penalty shootout
[9146.34 - 9149.46] P:1523.20 E:0.024866 |  And the good news is i'm describing the portuguese penalty
[9150.90 - 9155.46] P:1735.57 E:0.030938 |  Let me just tell you the procedure for choosing which goal it's all down to the referee in the end
[9156.58 - 9161.62] P:1817.18 E:0.028004 |  They give the referee the the option of tossing a coin if you like heads to the right tails to the left
[9161.62 - 9165.70] P:1743.40 E:0.027156 |  But the referee can say because i've had a look at the rules the one of the penalty spots
[9165.70 - 9168.42] P:1661.70 E:0.030710 |  It's a bit too many divots around it. It'll be too hard for the
[9168.90 - 9170.90] P:1810.78 E:0.029263 |  Taker to keep his his feet
[9171.62 - 9173.38] P:1724.90 E:0.029099 |  They look actually from here graham pretty similar
[9173.38 - 9174.74] P:1563.03 E:0.028018 |  So i think they're going to toss the coin
[9174.74 - 9175.86] P:1470.58 E:0.028443 |  We should just tell the people at home
[9175.86 - 9180.50] P:1630.79 E:0.029072 |  Of course at three of england's penalty takers if you like at the start of play are off the field runy
[9181.06 - 9186.50] P:1584.44 E:0.029479 |  Gerard and skulls so that leaves oan beckham and lampard and you reckon verselen hargrews
[9186.82 - 9190.18] P:1555.69 E:0.034875 |  Is that your my guessing for verselen hargrews? That's the two and i would
[9190.90 - 9195.46] P:1546.12 E:0.029009 |  Guess that will take them yeah graham taylor has said all day that england would win on penalties
[9195.46 - 9200.82] P:1698.56 E:0.028591 |  Just to give you hope wherever you are at home if you're driving i would stop pull over onto the hard shoulder
[9201.30 - 9205.70] P:1593.87 E:0.028266 |  Whatever happens we have to congratulate england for coming back because when ruicosta scored
[9206.74 - 9209.70] P:1681.50 E:0.026574 |  It was like punching a balloon. You know it felt like it was all over
[9210.10 - 9216.18] P:1496.84 E:0.026060 |  Yeah, i mean they've come back great and we've got to really congratulate bolting because you know portugal go down so early
[9216.18 - 9220.82] P:1455.17 E:0.027666 |  But they kept coming on they kept coming on and i have to say this i have admiration for scolari
[9220.82 - 9224.34] P:1571.77 E:0.027376 |  I think i've been talking to you about this i'm looking at his substitutions
[9224.58 - 9230.02] P:1517.46 E:0.027603 |  He's you know at that he's got them spot on again really but hasn't he thrown forward and you know
[9230.02 - 9233.86] P:1468.07 E:0.031395 |  As i say they came and played a two four four at times, but looking at them now
[9233.94 - 9235.94] P:1438.61 E:0.032696 |  You know looking at the two squads of players
[9236.34 - 9241.62] P:1436.90 E:0.031552 |  It really is a question sort of who is the this is where the goalkeeper becomes the hero
[9241.94 - 9249.14] P:1501.51 E:0.030229 |  And that's part of the reason it would be very good for david james to become the hero usabio hero of the 1966
[9249.22 - 9252.34] P:1546.19 E:0.031820 |  World cup as far as portugal concern when they lost to england and semi finals
[9252.50 - 9259.38] P:1706.01 E:0.028062 |  He's been talking to ricardo england won at this stage euro 96 against spain. They lost italy and 90 semis terry
[9260.02 - 9264.50] P:1683.74 E:0.028046 |  Give us an idea from that knight in turein. What goes on at this stage before penalties?
[9264.66 - 9268.10] P:1410.68 E:0.029424 |  Well, i was substituted before the end so i never had the chance to ball a different penalty
[9268.18 - 9271.78] P:1532.72 E:0.030032 |  Not that i would but uh, what what's the chat like? What are people saying? What's happening?
[9271.78 - 9276.18] P:1500.69 E:0.030915 |  What you're doing is just as a as a as a sub or as a player or as a coach of manager
[9276.18 - 9279.22] P:1449.37 E:0.028735 |  You're going around your players and saying, you know calling us third again
[9279.22 - 9283.22] P:1528.05 E:0.030830 |  You've won it had a chance to win the match before when you think about sir alfranzio when he said, you know
[9283.30 - 9285.62] P:1494.54 E:0.032634 |  You've won the world cup and i've got no going with it again
[9286.02 - 9287.54] P:1502.20 E:0.032814 |  And they've had the opportunities
[9287.54 - 9293.46] P:1534.67 E:0.033638 |  It's just about confidence england of england of 1 1 and lost 3 of shoo ties portugal have never been in this situation
[9293.70 - 9297.22] P:1566.73 E:0.027084 |  And in a major competition. Well, let's let's pick it up as they would say
[9297.70 - 9300.98] P:1693.63 E:0.028233 |  Using the vernacular for david james if he's if he's a bit iffy at some crosses
[9301.06 - 9304.42] P:1603.97 E:0.028192 |  There's nothing wrong with his shot stopping graham. That's that's a very good shot stopper
[9304.50 - 9308.82] P:1470.13 E:0.028991 |  He's a very good shot stop having said that they say that ricardo is this penalty expert
[9308.98 - 9314.26] P:1466.73 E:0.032359 |  So we're gonna wait and say we'll find out very shortly. It really is now mark about keeping you
[9315.54 - 9317.70] P:1689.39 E:0.034732 |  Sol camel has just gone over and hug david james
[9317.70 - 9323.62] P:1817.24 E:0.034986 |  How ironic the sol camel thought he'd won the game as he thought he'd won the game against argentina in france 98
[9323.62 - 9327.38] P:1838.81 E:0.034942 |  As we hear the national anthem sung from the fans away to our right
[9327.94 - 9329.94] P:1852.89 E:0.034742 |  And the players are just dousing themselves
[9329.94 - 9332.98] P:1833.55 E:0.033037 |  Sleucing themselves down with water there the subs are having a word with them
[9333.38 - 9336.90] P:1841.54 E:0.032457 |  I would imagine some of those situations are so nervous. You actually don't really want to talk to anybody
[9336.98 - 9339.78] P:1752.15 E:0.030751 |  Do you particularly you get your mind in order? I think all of the time
[9339.86 - 9345.62] P:1823.75 E:0.032140 |  But you know without getting me too clever about it this term visualization is so important now
[9345.94 - 9348.58] P:1636.96 E:0.033587 |  You know when these people when they walk from that
[9348.82 - 9353.70] P:1521.15 E:0.030450 |  This would be my view and has been my view with with players all of the time on penalty shootouts
[9354.02 - 9359.62] P:1613.23 E:0.031894 |  When you walk from that halfway line, you must visualize that ball in the net
[9359.70 - 9361.86] P:1861.58 E:0.030680 |  You see it. You are going to score
[9362.26 - 9366.34] P:1804.01 E:0.032059 |  Mike very important. Mike in and can you just remind everybody what you said at the beginning of the program about
[9367.06 - 9370.58] P:1717.22 E:0.029797 |  I can't remember what you said Mike whether they were going to they were going to blast them or place them bearing in mind
[9370.58 - 9371.46] P:1913.57 E:0.026246 |  The state of the pitch
[9371.46 - 9376.42] P:1616.23 E:0.029615 |  Well, the the theory was this morning that it's best to try and place them and not to take a run and blast them
[9376.82 - 9382.50] P:1534.06 E:0.032674 |  Because the rounds a little unsure a little uneven around and also the further on down the road we get with the penalties
[9382.58 - 9384.58] P:1568.44 E:0.025849 |  The more the surface will become a problem
[9386.02 - 9389.78] P:1869.84 E:0.031914 |  The portuguese are in a huddle scolari is in there giving them a rousing speech
[9389.86 - 9392.34] P:1778.21 E:0.028731 |  I can see him punching the air with both fists
[9392.74 - 9394.74] P:1806.26 E:0.029173 |  Svenja and ericsson much calmer
[9394.74 - 9397.70] P:1631.61 E:0.031127 |  But we have seen him a lot more animated in the second half and you pointed that out
[9397.70 - 9402.10] P:1662.61 E:0.030711 |  You wonder whether that was a direct result of what had happened that den shizoko when he was criticized for not being animated
[9402.10 - 9405.14] P:1640.57 E:0.030422 |  Yeah, we've seen him come up onto that line and we did say well
[9405.14 - 9411.30] P:1528.24 E:0.032768 |  I wonder if this is now a manager learning about what the english public expects sometimes, you know, and if so that's good
[9411.38 - 9412.18] P:1557.13 E:0.023388 |  That's fine
[9412.18 - 9417.06] P:1688.95 E:0.029650 |  Now that I can see ersmile saying to the captains if it lands this side this end that side that end
[9417.46 - 9419.46] P:1760.02 E:0.032843 |  He is pointing away to our left
[9420.58 - 9425.22] P:1796.86 E:0.032454 |  He's pointing away to our left. That is the end in which frank lampard's just equalized now. Ersmire
[9425.86 - 9428.98] P:1740.53 E:0.034029 |  Is oh hang on is it best of three? I think it's best of three
[9429.70 - 9432.10] P:1757.59 E:0.032350 |  Well, he's tossed the coin again. He's caught it this time
[9433.94 - 9438.66] P:1792.39 E:0.029503 |  Oh, right. So one one was about who takes the kick and one was about which end okay
[9439.70 - 9442.42] P:1790.61 E:0.025337 |  Now we're getting there as uh, Mike said he
[9442.74 - 9447.06] P:1774.32 E:0.026748 |  Mike England will do the portugal kicks and allen green is going to do the england kicks
[9448.34 - 9450.34] P:1651.82 E:0.027804 |  This is not good for anyone's heart
[9451.86 - 9456.02] P:1693.27 E:0.034371 |  This really isn't like england is it england taking the first one. Let's go to allen green
[9457.46 - 9462.10] P:1789.59 E:0.034104 |  Well, it's all in mike's mind, you know, he just thinks he's totally jinxed with penalty kicks
[9463.46 - 9465.78] P:1664.90 E:0.032736 |  He's not really putting much pressure on me to get us through
[9467.22 - 9470.42] P:1559.79 E:0.029501 |  I think he will take the first penalty and I think it will be david beckham
[9471.06 - 9473.06] P:1578.65 E:0.022910 |  Who will take the penalty?
[9473.06 - 9475.06] P:1735.03 E:0.033422 |  Ricardo is certainly making his way
[9476.58 - 9481.86] P:1791.68 E:0.029560 |  To the end to our left behind which there's a massive portuguese fans
[9482.58 - 9485.94] P:1633.56 E:0.031777 |  And beckham is just on the edge of the center circle at the moment
[9487.06 - 9492.10] P:1623.23 E:0.034698 |  Ersmire making his way towards the penalty here. Oh, it's an age for these things to happen
[9492.74 - 9494.74] P:1656.85 E:0.032224 |  But it will be beckham first
[9494.98 - 9504.26] P:1871.46 E:0.033308 |  All right, we do remember how he scuffed it in his stand bowl but put that mind put that out of your mind david
[9505.54 - 9507.54] P:1987.27 E:0.029991 |  Beckham the england skipper
[9507.78 - 9509.78] P:1985.88 E:0.031056 |  Is going to take the first penalty kick
[9510.34 - 9514.66] P:1973.14 E:0.032650 |  And ricardo is trying to psych him out of this. He hasn't made it to his goal line yet
[9515.06 - 9518.82] P:1852.62 E:0.032358 |  He's now glaring at beckham. Do me a favor referee do your job
[9519.38 - 9522.42] P:1857.97 E:0.030477 |  Get ricardo onto the line beckham's not looking at him
[9523.38 - 9525.38] P:1900.89 E:0.034394 |  Beckham places the ball on the spot
[9526.50 - 9533.22] P:1969.74 E:0.034063 |  Beckham to put england in front in the penalty shootout ricardo on his line here comes beckham. Oh, it's awful
[9533.46 - 9535.78] P:1650.39 E:0.039708 |  It's over the crossbar. It's simply awful
[9538.10 - 9542.98] P:1611.98 E:0.034961 |  I think david beckham looked at the pitch there of a much too sure definitely wasn't the slip of the wire as there was
[9543.54 - 9545.30] P:1423.95 E:0.035945 |  In yes, there was a definite movement there
[9545.30 - 9546.98] P:1460.56 E:0.036127 |  His left foot went down alongside the ball
[9546.98 - 9550.82] P:1620.43 E:0.036360 |  It was too close to the ball and his right foot then slipped as he struck the ball
[9550.90 - 9552.90] P:1468.77 E:0.035366 |  And it went miles over the crossbar
[9555.14 - 9559.22] P:1688.17 E:0.033078 |  Which is exactly what we were saying before the game but now deco
[9561.06 - 9562.50] P:1616.86 E:0.033891 |  European
[9562.50 - 9564.82] P:1607.12 E:0.032951 |  champions league winner with porto
[9565.46 - 9568.26] P:1713.94 E:0.030339 |  After david beckham's miss. It was a touch of the
[9568.90 - 9574.42] P:1796.33 E:0.030953 |  Roberto Baggio's deco can give portugal the psychological advantage one he can get a ball that is
[9575.14 - 9577.46] P:1822.52 E:0.027790 |  But david james david beckham having missed
[9578.18 - 9582.50] P:1780.37 E:0.030116 |  Another david now can redeem all that and send us back to nil nil once more
[9583.46 - 9586.66] P:1831.69 E:0.034837 |  Deco with all the portuguese fans behind david james goal
[9587.22 - 9592.34] P:1875.49 E:0.032231 |  Trying to steady himself for one play you were thought was guaranteed to score for england was david beckham
[9592.98 - 9597.14] P:1885.37 E:0.033915 |  He has failed now. What can deco do? He's going to run at this sport from about 10 yards
[9597.54 - 9601.78] P:1707.03 E:0.036886 |  Davy james is there and deco sends him the wrong way and portugal are what in front?
[9602.82 - 9606.82] P:1628.68 E:0.035279 |  A simple penalty really just there on the run up david james thought he's going to go to his right
[9606.82 - 9611.86] P:1613.00 E:0.032327 |  It was right footed david james went to the right the ball went to the left in the back of the net a simple penalty
[9611.86 - 9615.14] P:1755.92 E:0.032779 |  No, didn't blast it just passed it into the net one nil portugal
[9616.42 - 9618.42] P:1974.44 E:0.033683 |  Michael oan is next
[9619.30 - 9624.10] P:1981.16 E:0.035644 |  My own has a pretty indifferent record to put it mildly for libra pool from the penalty spot
[9624.98 - 9626.98] P:2037.00 E:0.035036 |  He has to get this one really
[9627.14 - 9634.18] P:2076.23 E:0.036047 |  This to put a little bit of pressure on the portuguese and michael oan like johnny wilkinson is sort of trumping down the area
[9634.82 - 9636.82] P:2140.84 E:0.031278 |  Around the penalty spot
[9637.30 - 9641.30] P:2036.36 E:0.032372 |  Ricardo in advance of his line now he retreats
[9641.94 - 9643.46] P:2056.65 E:0.033350 |  on
[9643.46 - 9648.02] P:1987.64 E:0.036189 |  Stairs of the goal looks at the referee has to score michael and he does score
[9648.34 - 9652.50] P:1650.65 E:0.035504 |  Right in the center of the goal as ricardo went to the left. It's one one, but remember
[9653.22 - 9658.50] P:1726.80 E:0.032871 |  Portugal still have a spot keeping reserve. Yeah, I think that penalty spot is quite loose isn't it? It's not particularly
[9658.50 - 9664.90] P:1677.74 E:0.031365 |  Very heavy or very secure penalty spot, but that was right down the middle kept low from michael oan ricardo went to his left
[9665.14 - 9668.58] P:1632.63 E:0.030860 |  No doubt about in the back of the net one one portugal still have the advantage
[9669.06 - 9672.74] P:1868.07 E:0.030873 |  And this is schemao who made such a big difference when he came on as a substitute
[9673.06 - 9676.50] P:1861.99 E:0.031415 |  He replaces the divot. It's going to get increasingly hard to take these penalties
[9676.98 - 9680.90] P:1834.97 E:0.030790 |  Simao, of course playing in his home stadium the benfica player
[9681.46 - 9685.62] P:1889.88 E:0.031341 |  If david james can save or simao misses then it's all square again

[10298.82 - 10301.70] P:1587.59 E:0.034397 |  I mean I said to you at the start that he takes the penalties for villa
[10302.18 - 10304.42] P:1598.09 E:0.035163 |  And I was hoping to see him in the first five
[10304.98 - 10309.54] P:1666.40 E:0.031356 |  Once I hadn't seen him in that I think I discussed with you. He doesn't want to take one
[10310.02 - 10314.02] P:1612.23 E:0.032751 |  And that just disturbed me a little bit because he does take them for villa
[10314.26 - 10318.90] P:1704.95 E:0.031437 |  But he's a very very sensitive boy and this will hurt him tremendously
[10319.38 - 10322.58] P:1800.63 E:0.032438 |  You save you the great hero of portuguese football
[10323.14 - 10325.14] P:1744.23 E:0.030783 |  Has just been congratulating
[10325.14 - 10328.90] P:1746.70 E:0.031912 |  The present hero of portuguese football ricardo. I think you save you as in floods of tears
[10328.90 - 10334.42] P:1806.55 E:0.029944 |  He's clasping a white towel to his face as we can see pictures of england fans are in tears
[10334.74 - 10338.34] P:1779.88 E:0.032906 |  It's been that sort of evening. It's been the most extraordinary game of football
[10338.58 - 10343.38] P:1790.71 E:0.029106 |  It has been thrilling and exciting and ultimately as happens so often grab
[10343.46 - 10346.90] P:1696.64 E:0.031332 |  It seems as if england are on the wrong end of it. I'm totally sick
[10346.98 - 10352.66] P:1570.30 E:0.031301 |  I'm totally gutted because I honestly thought and I know I said look it will go to penalties now
[10352.74 - 10355.62] P:1664.49 E:0.033992 |  It's easy to be boasting but what I did say england will win
[10355.94 - 10358.82] P:1603.66 E:0.033682 |  I was convinced it was going to be a very very tight game
[10359.06 - 10363.94] P:1577.19 E:0.032880 |  But I really thought this was the time england would take it to on penalties now having said that
[10364.66 - 10366.74] P:1690.48 E:0.033408 |  It's very difficult to say this at this moment
[10366.82 - 10375.46] P:1599.20 E:0.032251 |  But this is the job to do to look at the game in that 120 minutes one has to say that portugal had the better of that 120 minutes
[10375.70 - 10379.70] P:1730.82 E:0.028748 |  But that's it. They came back it comes to penalties. We're out
[10380.82 - 10382.82] P:1640.11 E:0.029349 |  And what else can I say?
[10383.22 - 10386.74] P:1767.24 E:0.031339 |  Just a picture of uh, louis philippe scolari congratulating his goalkeeper
[10386.74 - 10389.30] P:1795.66 E:0.031285 |  It's very interesting looking at the slow motion replay of the penalties
[10389.30 - 10396.18] P:1726.79 E:0.028447 |  You can definitely see the urb has been kicked up whenever the penalty taker puts his standing foot next to the spot near the ball
[10396.18 - 10401.78] P:1645.16 E:0.030348 |  That's it seems to what happened to david beckham who's missed three penalties in a row now for industry tours
[10401.86 - 10406.42] P:1582.77 E:0.030027 |  They all looked at their standing thing there and players wanted to get that right and obviously, you know
[10406.82 - 10410.42] P:1559.30 E:0.031033 |  People will bear on that on the actual penalty shootout itself
[10411.22 - 10415.38] P:1687.68 E:0.033963 |  First time goes on. They'll be looking more. There'll be more analysis of the game itself
[10415.46 - 10419.22] P:1572.60 E:0.029452 |  You know how it went how it was it possible for it to go to penalties?
[10419.30 - 10421.30] P:1582.40 E:0.032469 |  I think that's where it comes in at the moment
[10421.46 - 10427.30] P:1604.53 E:0.031921 |  It's impossible to do that because of all the emotion the host country for portugal they're through
[10427.62 - 10431.70] P:1454.12 E:0.033930 |  I mean what a night this is going we're not going to be able to move in lisbon for probably all of them
[10431.78 - 10436.42] P:1825.66 E:0.028481 |  Night scolari has had a portuguese flag in his right hand a brazilian flag in his left hand
[10436.42 - 10437.30] P:1821.62 E:0.031705 |  He is brazilian of course
[10437.30 - 10442.74] P:1749.45 E:0.026975 |  He's classed them both to his chest as if to say you know they're inside me side by side
[10442.90 - 10449.14] P:1596.89 E:0.031124 |  Can we just talk about the game very briefly because england appeared to be as an attacking force completely neutered by the injury to wain rooney
[10449.30 - 10451.70] P:1491.33 E:0.031394 |  Yeah, I mean the thing is the way that portugal played
[10452.34 - 10457.38] P:1560.16 E:0.031517 |  You we always fancied that england would catch them on the break and with a rooney in there
[10457.38 - 10460.10] P:1444.93 E:0.034271 |  We would have done so we would have had better opportunities
[10460.26 - 10462.02] P:1330.95 E:0.031086 |  We would have been able to complete them
[10462.02 - 10467.54] P:1480.12 E:0.029835 |  But having said that he's gone off and what what what I would say for scolari and I've said it before
[10468.02 - 10472.82] P:1487.02 E:0.032550 |  I look at the man. I see how he handled the brazilian situation. I look at his substitutions
[10472.82 - 10477.62] P:1501.32 E:0.031608 |  What is he doing and I tell you what he got this right he got this spot on for his country
[10478.58 - 10483.38] P:1729.58 E:0.029826 |  Was there anything else that england could have done do you think after the rooney injury to try and
[10483.86 - 10486.90] P:1696.52 E:0.031877 |  Reinvigorate get some momentum back into their attacking play
[10487.46 - 10490.10] P:1392.81 E:0.032634 |  I think it was very very important that they got closer
[10490.90 - 10492.98] P:1619.25 E:0.028345 |  to their to their front two and you know
[10493.62 - 10499.94] P:1549.05 E:0.030581 |  The the the balls up to the front two were coming from the back of the team the back four or the back side of the team
[10500.26 - 10502.66] P:1593.97 E:0.035458 |  Where really if you're going to get a good service in
[10503.30 - 10505.94] P:1326.49 E:0.033939 |  The ball has to come from the middle part of the pitch
[10506.50 - 10511.62] P:1546.77 E:0.032919 |  And we were not able to do that. We were pegged back in so much that when we did get the ball
[10511.86 - 10515.22] P:1626.71 E:0.033988 |  We were trying to find our front then from too far away
[10515.62 - 10520.98] P:1663.30 E:0.033022 |  And that made it very difficult for them because we desperately needed the ball in the portuguese half
[10521.22 - 10526.98] P:1606.13 E:0.033603 |  To hold it up by our front people so that we could link in but we were trying to find them from too far away
[10527.62 - 10532.50] P:1815.40 E:0.029623 |  Mark Wright and 606 interactive will be out shortly 0 500 9 0 9 6 9 3
[10532.58 - 10539.14] P:1921.81 E:0.026973 |  I'm sure you've got plenty to say about what's happened here this evening england are out of euro 2004
[10539.14 - 10547.54] P:1894.16 E:0.027676 |  They have lost 6 5 on penalties after a 2 2 draw at after extra time after a 1 1 draw after 90 minutes
[10547.78 - 10553.94] P:1784.33 E:0.027925 |  The portuguese still celebrating away to our left most of the england fans not surprisingly have headed towards the exits
[10553.94 - 10555.54] P:1835.59 E:0.024592 |  There's still a few flags of st
[10555.54 - 10562.58] P:1758.64 E:0.027101 |  George looking rather limp as they hang over the barriers and the front row of the various tears here as we just try
[10562.58 - 10566.42] P:1692.32 E:0.029100 |  Tears is really quite an appropriate word, isn't it as we just try and soak it all in
[10567.22 - 10570.90] P:1652.50 E:0.028504 |  And it's it's I really feel for drasper cell as you do because you know
[10570.90 - 10577.14] P:1612.47 E:0.030812 |  He just joined the list of of waddle and south gate and pierce and you know, we know chris wadley works with us on five live and
[10577.94 - 10579.06] P:1461.68 E:0.033415 |  People still talk about it now
[10579.06 - 10583.30] P:1605.88 E:0.030854 |  They talk about it even inadvertently somebody sort of mentions a penalty and they sort of can't help but look at chris
[10583.38 - 10585.38] P:1501.98 E:0.030480 |  And it's slightly snigger never goes away
[10585.38 - 10587.38] P:1376.17 E:0.031902 |  I've never taken a penalty for england
[10587.38 - 10592.74] P:1475.00 E:0.030599 |  But I've been the manager of a side that was one they love and lost to one and taken a great deal of criticism for it
[10593.06 - 10594.02] P:1435.22 E:0.032555 |  Life has to go on
[10594.02 - 10597.86] P:1567.51 E:0.029423 |  I mean if I see dorayas, he's got to learn very very quickly
[10598.18 - 10601.22] P:1557.12 E:0.029605 |  Yet the penalty is missed, but it's not the end of your footballing life
[10601.22 - 10605.22] P:1546.52 E:0.026430 |  It's not the end of your life and you've got to have some character and something to to handle it
[10605.30 - 10609.30] P:1547.74 E:0.031107 |  It's going to be very very difficult for him because it will stick with him for the rest of his life
[10609.46 - 10611.86] P:1312.11 E:0.033903 |  And it doesn't matter whether even people remind him about it
[10612.02 - 10616.18] P:1643.50 E:0.029044 |  It's there and it's how he handles it and copes with it to say he's very sensitive
[10616.26 - 10621.06] P:1771.70 E:0.030271 |  How much is this an opportunity missed from england's point of view in terms of going all the way and winning something?
[10621.38 - 10624.90] P:1566.58 E:0.026506 |  Big opportunity. I mean once again, it's not me just saying it for now
[10625.14 - 10630.26] P:1644.36 E:0.028169 |  You know the conversations that we've had I was convinced that if england got through this game
[10630.26 - 10634.34] P:1481.71 E:0.030075 |  They would go and win the tournament, but I was also convinced that this was their hardest game
[10634.42 - 10639.22] P:1467.66 E:0.030337 |  I never thought that they would have a harder game than this if they could get the top side of portugal
[10639.46 - 10641.46] P:1430.98 E:0.031373 |  I was very convinced that they would go through
[10641.86 - 10646.90] P:1559.59 E:0.029342 |  But I always thought it was going to be much tighter than some of the people probably back home
[10647.06 - 10650.50] P:1565.63 E:0.030612 |  Realized it was going to be this win that portugal had over spain
[10651.06 - 10654.42] P:1615.46 E:0.030682 |  And it's been so much that they've shifted this nation so much
[10654.42 - 10660.42] P:1489.62 E:0.031443 |  I've been coming in and out flying in and out for the england games then going back and doing work in london
[10660.42 - 10662.42] P:1646.60 E:0.026511 |  So I've been able to pick up the feelings
[10662.98 - 10672.02] P:1593.74 E:0.029117 |  And I was concerned because I never felt that back home it was we were really totally aware of what that win for spain did for this nation
[10672.50 - 10678.50] P:1706.69 E:0.030661 |  Terry, you know exactly what they're going through you felt it in the changing room in Turin 14 years ago
[10678.50 - 10682.74] P:1596.32 E:0.027700 |  What will be being said in there at the moment if anything at all it would be complete silence
[10682.74 - 10686.42] P:1373.05 E:0.026405 |  You don't really comprehend what's happened. You know you've played a game of football 120 minutes
[10686.42 - 10690.90] P:1502.74 E:0.024895 |  You play well in the game. It's gone end to end staff has been a fantastic advert for football
[10691.46 - 10695.94] P:1470.54 E:0.028171 |  And if you've drawn the game 2 2 you've lost on penalty some have taken penalty some haven't taken penalties
[10696.02 - 10698.42] P:1523.38 E:0.027580 |  There'll be a lot of players there that will be in tears
[10698.42 - 10700.90] P:1350.12 E:0.029522 |  There'll be a lot of players there that feel that they've let the country down
[10701.54 - 10704.50] P:1386.86 E:0.028112 |  And feel that they let the teammates down and the families down
[10704.74 - 10708.58] P:1444.97 E:0.026391 |  It's an awful awful feeling and looking at the stadium now it takes me back to Euro 96
[10708.58 - 10713.38] P:1401.02 E:0.022954 |  And when I know how the Spanish were feeling now after the quarter final in the london penalties then because
[10713.86 - 10718.10] P:1526.79 E:0.026041 |  Spain played very well in that match if you remember and then lost on penalties and it's a sick feeling
[10718.90 - 10720.90] P:1577.67 E:0.024806 |  You say what is the best way to
[10720.90 - 10724.34] P:1628.55 E:0.026945 |  To to to come to a solution in a game like this. I think this is the best way
[10724.34 - 10728.18] P:1486.08 E:0.032606 |  It's the only way and when you're the loser it's the most awful feeling in the world
[10728.18 - 10730.74] P:1447.04 E:0.035333 |  That does take you guys to get over but when you're the winner
[10731.30 - 10733.30] P:1662.95 E:0.034433 |  You know you move on to the next match
[10733.30 - 10736.26] P:1774.42 E:0.031181 |  The cheer is for Ricardo Cavallo who's been named the man of the match
[10736.50 - 10741.38] P:1818.07 E:0.026648 |  Let me tell you six six six interactive in about five minutes time 0500 909 693
[10741.54 - 10743.70] P:1667.95 E:0.033968 |  I think it's only fair to Darius Vasell
[10744.58 - 10749.78] P:1699.43 E:0.030217 |  Mark to say that there was two penalties missed, you know, I mean it isn't throwing it on to david beckham
[10750.02 - 10752.98] P:1728.01 E:0.030210 |  But to have a start where the penalty is missed doesn't help
[10752.98 - 10758.74] P:1654.70 E:0.031023 |  So I think in fairness because it will all come, you know Darius Vasell missing the penalty because we were level again
[10759.70 - 10761.78] P:1808.36 E:0.027664 |  But you know there's a couple of penalties have been
[10762.26 - 10764.02] P:2005.50 E:0.025943 |  Darius's was saved
[10764.02 - 10767.94] P:1935.94 E:0.027664 |  David's was missed he lost his footing, but I think it is only fair to mention
[10767.94 - 10770.74] P:1711.43 E:0.029633 |  I wouldn't want it all to be thrown on to to Darius
[10770.74 - 10773.86] P:1860.58 E:0.030018 |  It's got to be a shared job and knowing david beckham as I do
[10774.18 - 10779.14] P:1809.65 E:0.027550 |  I think he will make sure that it's shared portugal against sweden or holland in the semi-final terry
[10779.78 - 10783.54] P:1853.80 E:0.029096 |  Well, we always look back at this night and think what might have been and I'm talking about the wane rooney injury
[10783.62 - 10786.34] P:1725.89 E:0.025711 |  Because that seems such a several moment as far as england were concerned
[10786.42 - 10791.70] P:1440.67 E:0.029831 |  Yeah, it was and it was as grand quite rightly says it was one-way traffic really with portugal attack attack attack
[10791.70 - 10794.58] P:1542.57 E:0.029964 |  I didn't really create any chances and possibly until the goal
[10795.22 - 10799.06] P:1523.46 E:0.031936 |  But they always had the pressure we said we knew how they play we knew with the wide man, etc
[10799.06 - 10801.22] P:1596.54 E:0.023960 |  I said to but you just felt that second goal
[10801.54 - 10805.14] P:1465.64 E:0.027640 |  If when it was scored if it was scored by england then england would have won the match
[10805.14 - 10809.70] P:1541.42 E:0.028588 |  But it was just a final ball up to the strikers in england just couldn't get out and then with four attackers
[10809.78 - 10814.34] P:1625.70 E:0.028638 |  I mean I mean scolari did ever so well. He put four attackers on he sometimes played two four four
[10814.66 - 10817.86] P:1576.05 E:0.029268 |  Generally with a three and a three in midfield and four up and it was very bold
[10817.86 - 10820.50] P:1559.33 E:0.027729 |  It was very it's england then couldn't get out because they couldn't get out
[10820.50 - 10823.30] P:1618.58 E:0.028418 |  They were forced back and in the end one cross comes in one
[10823.86 - 10828.34] P:1538.66 E:0.028441 |  Mistake in marking one slight error and it's in the back of the net and then you've got extra time by putting the
[10828.34 - 10830.82] P:1515.43 E:0.026237 |  Well an extra time I thought that they looked fit
[10830.82 - 10831.94] P:1691.90 E:0.023738 |  They did well
[10831.94 - 10837.94] P:1651.30 E:0.027249 |  Had the hammer blow of the ruicosta second goal but still came back after that so buckets buckets of energy buckets of heart
[10838.18 - 10841.46] P:1704.34 E:0.031278 |  From the england team but when you lose and in penalties, you know
[10841.46 - 10843.06] P:1853.64 E:0.025772 |  It's
[10843.06 - 10845.78] P:1760.04 E:0.030262 |  I mean if you've been there, you know what it's like if you haven't been there
[10845.78 - 10848.74] P:1582.28 E:0.033674 |  You'll never know but I tell you what is the worst worst feeling in the world
[10848.74 - 10850.74] P:1709.66 E:0.030900 |  It's not a nice way to lose a football game
[10850.90 - 10855.14] P:1741.19 E:0.025256 |  Well, I remember coming out of wembley after your own 96 having been there as a punter and I felt you know
[10855.14 - 10858.10] P:1586.83 E:0.031607 |  I felt the worst I've ever felt at any sporting event. I mean
[10858.66 - 10862.10] P:1733.97 E:0.027951 |  It was so cruel on the england team. Let me ask you
[10862.90 - 10869.38] P:1646.15 E:0.027398 |  When this leaves england going forward with with players like david beckham were 29 and gary neville who are 29 and so forth
[10869.38 - 10873.06] P:1740.59 E:0.028288 |  David james, you know, what is he now 33? Where does this leave england going?
[10873.14 - 10878.26] P:1555.28 E:0.030342 |  This is the biggest test for all of us because I just like to remind people of 1988
[10878.58 - 10881.30] P:1428.11 E:0.033137 |  When all three european games were lost under bobby
[10881.46 - 10886.82] P:1697.54 E:0.030663 |  There was a great thing let him get out six years in the job get him out pretty well a similar squad
[10886.98 - 10894.02] P:1760.06 E:0.030770 |  There were changes but a similar squad then went in only two years later and reached the semifinal of the world cup
[10894.26 - 10896.42] P:1575.69 E:0.028494 |  What is now a immense disappointment?
[10896.42 - 10902.26] P:1594.71 E:0.027215 |  No decisions at all, but I have to say I hope this manager and this squad of players do stay together
[10902.58 - 10909.54] P:1658.92 E:0.027544 |  Certainly for the next two years. I'm not going back on what I've said. We've got this tournament with a world cup with 2008
[10910.90 - 10917.70] P:1580.24 E:0.026517 |  This is a period of time when this squad is at its best is peaking. Don't let's just break it up and throw it about now
[10917.78 - 10921.06] P:1521.64 E:0.030539 |  Let's learn from the bobby robson era where we kept it together
[10921.14 - 10926.42] P:1862.47 E:0.028443 |  Sure and terry I think the difference between tonight and the day that we were together in shizoka is that england was so limp
[10926.66 - 10930.26] P:1874.18 E:0.026838 |  In that second half the people really did feel aggrieved didn't they that england hadn't given it everything
[10930.42 - 10935.70] P:1745.89 E:0.028507 |  They won't go away from this ground feeling that if apart from any other reason the way they came back at equalised with five minutes to go
[10935.78 - 10938.98] P:1801.92 E:0.028131 |  Will they they won't feel let down if you were they're not going to feel like that
[10939.06 - 10941.94] P:1491.78 E:0.027310 |  Well, the players will the players will feel that they let the country down
[10941.94 - 10945.86] P:1549.12 E:0.031187 |  Sure, but the supporters aren't going to feel like they have no the supporters won't feel that at all and you know
[10945.94 - 10949.94] P:1360.74 E:0.028583 |  You say well if there's bags of effort and commitment from england which there was today buckets of heart
[10950.02 - 10953.38] P:1329.28 E:0.029100 |  And like I said an energy and they had a real good go at them and yes
[10953.38 - 10957.78] P:1426.84 E:0.030753 |  You lose on penalty for seventh penalty that each side takes his is his gut wrenching
[10957.86 - 10961.46] P:1453.58 E:0.029867 |  It was great point from graene taylor the average age of the squad and it's about 25
[10962.02 - 10966.34] P:1611.03 E:0.031876 |  If you looking at 27 28 average ages of teams that go on and win tournaments
[10966.50 - 10971.54] P:1622.60 E:0.026910 |  That's what you need and I've always said this is probably a tournament too early. It's world cup 2006
[10971.94 - 10973.94] P:1721.58 E:0.026156 |  That's here from span, of course
[10974.90 - 10981.14] P:1338.23 E:0.021863 |  We had one nil and one one and they scored two one in extra time and we're coming back in extra time. That's fantastic
[10981.86 - 10984.34] P:1416.47 E:0.018599 |  then unfortunately we lost on penalties and
[10986.10 - 10987.54] P:1420.36 E:0.012502 |  That's uh
[10987.54 - 10989.54] P:1402.91 E:0.013584 |  That's very hard
[10989.54 - 10993.06] P:1573.73 E:0.021177 |  There were times when we looked like we were playing against 12 men and one was swiss
[10995.14 - 10998.02] P:1337.27 E:0.014725 |  Well, I don't want to comment that but
[10999.70 - 11001.70] P:1146.50 E:0.020151 |  We were not we were not lucky with
[11002.58 - 11007.86] P:1425.63 E:0.013603 |  Some things out there today, but that's football unfortunately. What did you make of that? This allowed goal the camel goal?
[11009.22 - 11012.66] P:1407.52 E:0.017981 |  Well from the bench it looked all right and
[11014.50 - 11019.94] P:1203.84 E:0.014305 |  I haven't seen it on on tv so I can't comment it but it looks all right, but the referee said it was
[11021.14 - 11022.82] P:1508.23 E:0.010416 |  It was a push and
[11022.82 - 11026.74] P:1710.23 E:0.013400 |  He decides the one thing we did see tonight was english spirit. You must be delighted with that
[11027.38 - 11030.42] P:1627.89 E:0.019778 |  Yeah, the spirit has been fantastic and I can't
[11031.38 - 11033.38] P:1175.39 E:0.020494 |  I have no complaints at all about
[11034.02 - 11035.54] P:1182.73 E:0.012465 |  Anything I mean
[11035.54 - 11038.50] P:1361.53 E:0.017011 |  The play has been fantastic the atmosphere has been fantastic all
[11039.30 - 11043.14] P:1223.98 E:0.019041 |  All the way through and the only thing we're losing in this way is
[11043.86 - 11045.86] P:1389.30 E:0.011788 |  Very hard. Thanks for talking to us. Thank you
[11046.42 - 11051.22] P:1717.33 E:0.025017 |  Garth crooks with a very target question about the referee there
[11051.86 - 11054.98] P:1665.82 E:0.030687 |  Terry, thank you very much indeed. We'll hear from more from Terry butchers throughout the tournament
[11055.22 - 11060.58] P:1669.73 E:0.028419 |  Anna green and my kingdom of course as well. He looked he looked completely shell shocked and who can blame him and we've said
[11060.58 - 11063.94] P:1688.37 E:0.023767 |  He's been a lucky manager tonight. He's not ran out. Yes, it did
[11064.34 - 11066.98] P:1183.86 E:0.030352 |  It ran out for him and for the and for the england boys
[11067.06 - 11073.06] P:1699.24 E:0.025734 |  But as I say you've got to get through all of these kind of things and then rethink no hasty decisions
[11073.30 - 11077.22] P:1624.88 E:0.023838 |  Let's think it through and then look back and learn from this experience and hopefully
[11077.78 - 11080.66] P:1709.84 E:0.024121 |  Make this squad a stronger and better squad for the next tournament
[11081.14 - 11083.38] P:1611.10 E:0.027668 |  And the one thing for the next one we've got about 20 seconds left
[11083.54 - 11088.10] P:1609.34 E:0.024439 |  We have discovered a very special talent in Wayne Rooney. I think we all knew about him anyway
[11088.74 - 11091.22] P:1508.20 E:0.022794 |  Definitely. Thank you very much indeed Graham
[11092.26 - 11096.82] P:1732.01 E:0.030952 |  The ground is pretty well empty now. We're getting our breath back after an extraordinary evening's football
[11096.82 - 11100.90] P:1841.81 E:0.029965 |  Of course france against greece tomorrow join us for that in the hose alvalade down the road
[11100.90 - 11106.26] P:1990.44 E:0.023523 |  Let's hope it matches up to the excitement here this evening. Here's 606 with mark bright
[11107.22 - 11109.22] P:1321.32 E:0.038844 |  This week on the bbc
[11111.54 - 11114.10] P:930.13 E:0.040596 |  A drama like no other is that point?
[11115.54 - 11117.62] P:1433.98 E:0.039408 |  Bone shaking thrills backhand reply
[11119.62 - 11126.02] P:1527.49 E:0.039111 |  Heart stopping shots defending champion is out at the first hurdle he's fallen lightning fast action
[11126.98 - 11131.14] P:1468.51 E:0.038185 |  126 miles per hour bizarre grunting noises
[11133.30 - 11136.02] P:1464.43 E:0.035535 |  And unbearable timmy tension
[11136.90 - 11147.14] P:1365.77 E:0.037130 |  Tim henman, this is match point Wimbledon 2004 on bbc tv bbc.co.uk and bbc radio five live
[11150.42 - 11153.38] P:1305.35 E:0.043218 |  Five live when we talk you listen
[11153.62 - 11159.54] P:1319.48 E:0.043235 |  Women in particular they do that sort of flapping thing like their walruses, you know, do you know that they've got flippers as though the
[11159.62 - 11164.50] P:1301.00 E:0.044549 |  Emotion is so much that they're liable to explode and when you talk we listen
[11164.74 - 11167.46] P:1214.33 E:0.039048 |  This remarking old man's a regular fan the thing that bugs me more
[11167.94 - 11172.34] P:1365.54 E:0.034342 |  Are the guys who don't watch football who come into the pub to try it on with the aforementioned women
[11172.50 - 11177.46] P:1448.54 E:0.044003 |  Speak your mind on the uk's home of live news and live sport five live
[11182.50 - 11187.22] P:1854.52 E:0.020368 |  Approach very very aggressive. Do you think that's the way england should go about it this evening?
[11189.54 - 11193.70] P:1695.80 E:0.027985 |  Well, I think that ironically their hand was forced against croatia and um
[11194.50 - 11198.90] P:1618.28 E:0.028282 |  They had to respond and they duly did i'm not looking for them to go a goal behind this evening, but
[11199.46 - 11203.86] P:1594.06 E:0.029266 |  Certainly it um it it pulled them around and um, they were left with no other alternative
[11204.26 - 11207.46] P:1590.33 E:0.025650 |  And it was very much in the end a kind of all-action premiership style
[11207.70 - 11209.78] P:1703.88 E:0.029817 |  The only trouble with all-action premiership style though as you
[11210.58 - 11212.58] P:1632.65 E:0.020452 |  can see girls as well
[11212.74 - 11214.74] P:1647.83 E:0.029538 |  Graham taylor good evening Graham again
[11215.30 - 11216.74] P:1636.29 E:0.024052 |  They seem very happy playing that way
[11216.74 - 11220.42] P:1648.47 E:0.027396 |  They didn't they because it perhaps is more in their nature their second nature
[11220.42 - 11224.26] P:1627.16 E:0.024578 |  Would you be unhappy to see them as being as as offensive this evening?
[11224.66 - 11226.66] P:1455.81 E:0.037645 |  I think it will all depend who
[11226.90 - 11231.70] P:1637.62 E:0.029085 |  Who takes the the best approach to it in that respect because I can see portugal doing the same
[11231.94 - 11233.94] P:1639.03 E:0.024838 |  I can't see portugal actually
[11233.94 - 11235.94] P:1716.68 E:0.026963 |  Starting as a slow fashion either
[11236.02 - 11239.46] P:1647.72 E:0.028731 |  And if both teams want to sort of go we can look forward to
[11240.10 - 11243.46] P:1613.33 E:0.023823 |  quite a sort of fast rate in that first 20 minutes
[11244.10 - 11247.22] P:1748.08 E:0.024085 |  How much does momentum count for in international football?
[11247.86 - 11253.70] P:1473.79 E:0.027549 |  Well, I think in any game it counts if you you know, you're into that run and you you feel good and you you feel confident
[11253.78 - 11255.78] P:1797.56 E:0.021842 |  And the results are there
[11256.02 - 11259.14] P:1531.74 E:0.028301 |  It doesn't really matter at all the thing about international football
[11259.86 - 11262.98] P:1399.18 E:0.028787 |  You can get the momentum in the tournaments that that's the most important thing
[11262.98 - 11266.42] P:1515.23 E:0.028516 |  You can't it's very hard to get the momentum in international football
[11266.42 - 11269.22] P:1549.92 E:0.030362 |  Otherwise because there's like six to eight weeks before every game
[11269.46 - 11272.74] P:1456.00 E:0.028826 |  But here in a tournament if you get that going then you can really be in business
[11273.54 - 11275.62] P:1860.52 E:0.029759 |  My kingdom has got some some news for us mic
[11275.94 - 11278.18] P:1459.51 E:0.027219 |  Well, it is the expected england lineup and I think
[11279.06 - 11283.46] P:1563.57 E:0.025569 |  Two crucial players in particular will be the fallbacks gary neville and ashley coal because
[11284.10 - 11288.66] P:1484.37 E:0.026846 |  They'll be looking after we hope the alternating wingers louis figo and cristiano ronaldo
[11289.06 - 11293.06] P:1549.58 E:0.024978 |  Now the let me give you the lineup just in case you're under it's david james gary neville
[11293.38 - 11298.02] P:1512.07 E:0.024292 |  John terry sol camel and ashley coal david beckham steven gerrard frank lampard paul skulls
[11298.50 - 11302.02] P:1457.79 E:0.023783 |  wane rooney and michael oin now portugal have five of the
[11302.82 - 11306.02] P:1552.44 E:0.027005 |  Porto players who won the champions league and three of them in particular
[11306.50 - 11308.82] P:1709.05 E:0.027587 |  trio in midfield i think a keymen costinia
[11309.30 - 11310.42] P:1947.28 E:0.016358 |  maniche
[11310.42 - 11312.42] P:1514.61 E:0.020419 |  and deco and england
[11312.74 - 11317.38] P:1424.05 E:0.027529 |  Can't allow deco to run right here. They have to get tight on them. I'll be interested to see what they do about that
[11317.62 - 11319.94] P:1572.37 E:0.028061 |  And interestingly talking about evolution mark
[11320.82 - 11321.78] P:1521.71 E:0.023778 |  only
[11321.78 - 11326.58] P:1472.51 E:0.027328 |  Five of these players played in the first game remember new no gomez comes in for the suspended pauleta
[11327.14 - 11331.30] P:1572.72 E:0.028819 |  And they've also changed three of the original back four from the first game and since they did that
[11332.02 - 11336.26] P:1512.58 E:0.027535 |  They haven't conceded a goal in the two games. Shall I just run through their side? It's ricardo miguel
[11336.66 - 11338.26] P:1282.17 E:0.025793 |  carriero
[11338.26 - 11344.90] P:1460.05 E:0.025553 |  Andrape, nuno valente the left back costinia maniche figo deco rinaldo and the one player coming in nuno gomez
[11344.90 - 11348.18] P:1624.32 E:0.029714 |  Let me just ask you might what you think portugal might do about wane rooney
[11348.18 - 11349.62] P:1624.35 E:0.027160 |  Will there be any possibility?
[11349.62 - 11353.14] P:1608.12 E:0.024406 |  Can you see of maybe a man-to-man marking job or is that unlikely?
[11353.54 - 11358.74] P:1487.56 E:0.023588 |  Well, i'm amazed that he hasn't been marked in the in the first three games and they do have players
[11358.82 - 11363.94] P:1583.69 E:0.023895 |  I mean, I think if they've been going to do that they might have brought pati in because that's his speciality the fact that they're
[11363.94 - 11366.42] P:1594.91 E:0.018825 |  Still going to go in with costina and
[11367.14 - 11371.62] P:1566.60 E:0.020752 |  And maniche maybe they're not going to but they'll you know, they'll have to be much tighter on and then either creo
[11371.62 - 11372.82] P:1551.25 E:0.013805 |  Escher or switzerland one
[11372.82 - 11377.54] P:1616.96 E:0.027767 |  Well, let's get a portuguese point of view then with kickoff round about in an hour's time
[11377.54 - 11380.90] P:1676.05 E:0.026683 |  Let's join our reporter here at the assadio deluge nijal adley
[11381.38 - 11383.46] P:1363.07 E:0.024403 |  Well mark downstairs here at the assadio deluge
[11383.54 - 11389.38] P:1325.65 E:0.028262 |  It's time to get a portuguese perspective on tonight's game with benedino barrage from a portuguese radio
[11389.46 - 11394.26] P:1073.23 E:0.026810 |  And benedino we're all excited at home in england. How excited is portugal being the past few days?
[11395.46 - 11401.62] P:1170.73 E:0.027322 |  Of course, that it's a lot of excitement here in portugal as you as you have already known and seen
[11402.90 - 11406.66] P:1199.87 E:0.026200 |  It's a difficult game between two beautiful
[11407.54 - 11409.38] P:1126.85 E:0.022877 |  teams
[11409.38 - 11413.22] P:1237.90 E:0.024862 |  For me and in my perspective, I haven't seen yet
[11414.02 - 11419.78] P:1070.82 E:0.024728 |  The true england, I suppose because the two first games that I have seen and the last one
[11420.42 - 11424.58] P:1250.58 E:0.023381 |  I don't I don't have the chance to do it to my to my radio station
[11425.06 - 11427.06] P:1093.78 E:0.027265 |  But I have seen the two
[11427.46 - 11429.14] P:1188.54 E:0.015634 |  first games and
[11429.14 - 11432.18] P:1396.81 E:0.022308 |  I think that england was not yet
[11432.82 - 11440.58] P:1061.46 E:0.022752 |  Obliged yeah to uh perform well. Nevertheless today, I suppose that it's a rough game
[11440.98 - 11445.62] P:1009.14 E:0.023021 |  But I suppose that it's a very tight game. I don't have any idea who is going to win or not
[11446.10 - 11448.34] P:854.86 E:0.025823 |  Don't ask me for that for a for a for a
[11448.58 - 11450.18] P:707.38 E:0.028365 |  for a
[11450.18 - 11458.34] P:1046.09 E:0.023749 |  Who is going to win? I suppose that both teams have chances. They have strong points. They have weak points
[11458.98 - 11463.38] P:1212.70 E:0.024645 |  But uh, portugal it's prepared for it. And is this Figo's final chance?
[11464.26 - 11470.58] P:1035.52 E:0.028246 |  For Figo it is for Fernando Cotto also for ricosta also for many of these
[11471.54 - 11477.70] P:1232.38 E:0.023766 |  Wonderful players that they are finishing this career. It's uh, it's it's it's it's it's the last chance
[11478.02 - 11482.10] P:1069.76 E:0.025249 |  I suppose that they have also the understanding for that
[11482.42 - 11489.06] P:1284.51 E:0.022706 |  So it's time to catch the last opportunity one final question. Are the portuguese scared of wane rune?
[11489.06 - 11494.74] P:1080.08 E:0.024791 |  I don't know we must ask for the players and you know with the answer because yesterday
[11494.98 - 11499.46] P:1076.55 E:0.028112 |  They told on the press conference that they are not afraid with especially with rune but all the team
[11500.02 - 11502.02] P:1345.07 E:0.022445 |  For me my understanding. It's that
[11502.98 - 11508.34] P:1007.60 E:0.025068 |  I am scared about rune not about oan and you know it for me the through oan
[11508.58 - 11513.46] P:1186.06 E:0.024996 |  It's not appeared yet in the euro 2004. I don't see the michael oan
[11514.02 - 11518.82] P:1385.32 E:0.026891 |  But i'm seeing rune. I see i'm seeing a great lampard the schools
[11519.46 - 11522.98] P:1357.17 E:0.021739 |  I'm seeing Beckham on spaces when it is necessary
[11523.62 - 11529.78] P:1127.72 E:0.026308 |  Is is uh, is playing but I suppose that we have a very very very strong team
[11530.02 - 11532.02] P:1353.32 E:0.021829 |  I'd like to wish you good luck, but I can't
[11532.58 - 11534.58] P:1691.56 E:0.027396 |  neither do I
[11535.78 - 11539.30] P:1549.25 E:0.028867 |  That's Nigel Adley in the bowels of the stadium here graham tater the way they play
[11539.62 - 11543.46] P:1761.12 E:0.025409 |  Portugal with just one up front and certainly and i've seen two of their three games live
[11543.54 - 11546.74] P:1533.53 E:0.024360 |  They struggle to get a lot of players in the penalty area playing that way
[11547.30 - 11551.30] P:1385.85 E:0.028869 |  Yeah, which surprises me a little bit because there is some natural attacking players
[11552.02 - 11556.82] P:1181.27 E:0.028685 |  And certainly deco would would get into the box you'd imagine and so that's a little bit of a surprise
[11557.22 - 11564.82] P:1406.67 E:0.027025 |  Just listening there to that interview about rune. I mean what's going to interest me is that andrade and carvalho
[11564.90 - 11569.14] P:1598.48 E:0.023353 |  The two centre backs of Portugal they're very quick. They're very strong
[11569.62 - 11571.94] P:1175.27 E:0.028959 |  And I think it's going to be quite a
[11572.58 - 11576.98] P:1332.53 E:0.030010 |  Battle in there the interesting to see if either one of them is prepared to step out onto
[11577.86 - 11583.06] P:1357.65 E:0.030918 |  Runi or when he when he drops off or leave it to the midfield to
[11583.54 - 11588.74] P:1708.93 E:0.027523 |  To take care of so you think it might be a situation where it just depends maybe where runi is on the field
[11588.74 - 11590.34] P:1683.45 E:0.024309 |  Whether one of those two
[11590.34 - 11593.70] P:1723.51 E:0.031991 |  Takes him or whether they might leave it to to to manisha or costinha
[11593.86 - 11599.38] P:1497.29 E:0.032982 |  Oh, it would be more like costinha because maniche will get but maniche has come in and as micking and was saying earlier
[11599.62 - 11605.86] P:1609.88 E:0.028755 |  The side is the portuguese side has evolved and maniche is now in here and could score goals from from midfield
[11605.86 - 11608.82] P:1594.48 E:0.027111 |  That is one thing that he can certainly do so when runi comes off
[11608.82 - 11613.78] P:1564.64 E:0.027341 |  It will either be a question of either one of the centre backs coming into him or leaving it to costinha
[11613.94 - 11616.18] P:1605.22 E:0.026479 |  The point i'm making the two centre backs of
[11616.66 - 11619.30] P:1617.62 E:0.025446 |  Portugal they're strong and they're very very quick
[11619.54 - 11624.18] P:1646.36 E:0.027252 |  We've talked about the way that and we're going to go to winmelden in a second the way that the portugal line up with
[11624.18 - 11628.66] P:1719.69 E:0.024205 |  Is 4 3 3 it does mean of course they have the ability to counter attack very quickly
[11628.82 - 11632.26] P:1659.97 E:0.024582 |  And as we've been talking about how aggressive and offensive england were against croatia
[11632.50 - 11635.06] P:1672.88 E:0.027818 |  If you as fen is that something that you would drum into the players
[11635.06 - 11638.82] P:1734.26 E:0.024277 |  Look, I know perhaps the way that they played against croatia is the way you want to play
[11638.98 - 11643.06] P:1621.29 E:0.022515 |  But just be very aware of the counter attack with the way that portugal is set up
[11643.22 - 11647.54] P:1436.62 E:0.029626 |  I think what happens now with the england team he will of course make them aware
[11647.94 - 11653.94] P:1539.11 E:0.028245 |  And they will be aware of how portugal play but i have this feeling that there'll be as much if not more talk
[11654.18 - 11656.18] P:1360.38 E:0.023749 |  About how you're going to beat portugal
[11656.98 - 11662.42] P:1679.73 E:0.026468 |  Mike, uh the counter attack is that a way that you can see a portugal perhaps approaching this match?
[11663.70 - 11668.90] P:1376.55 E:0.024719 |  Well the biggest part i'm just hoping that england have grown up in the four years since they last met portugal in the
[11669.62 - 11672.42] P:1349.85 E:0.019835 |  I just remember that game in particular in eindhoven
[11673.06 - 11677.38] P:1420.49 E:0.025522 |  And england were just outnumbered all the time in midfield. This is why i come back to these particular three
[11677.94 - 11682.98] P:1497.25 E:0.025259 |  Um, I was talking to esparan heroics and yesterday and he said it is a difficult system to play against
[11682.98 - 11689.86] P:1614.81 E:0.024012 |  It's it's a little similar to the brazilian system. The two guys that grand's been talking about costinia and maniche sort of
[11690.98 - 11694.98] P:1596.93 E:0.025521 |  Sit in front of that back four. I know maniche does get forward, but then that allows the likes of
[11695.70 - 11702.02] P:1443.71 E:0.025209 |  That allows figo and deco and ronaldo to do their stuff and they of course will try and support nuno germas
[11702.82 - 11706.02] P:1305.17 E:0.029036 |  They're not a team full of goals though, but I just worry that england will go for long
[11706.66 - 11709.70] P:1501.62 E:0.023637 |  Particularly if they're sloppy again with their work in midfield
[11709.70 - 11712.50] P:1128.91 E:0.028685 |  They've got to keep the ball and uh, they don't keep the ball then
[11712.98 - 11716.66] P:1372.27 E:0.028642 |  They'll they'll have long periods chasing it and it's still quite warm here mark as well tonight
[11716.82 - 11718.82] P:1495.36 E:0.024567 |  I just got a flash on the screen a few moments ago
[11719.22 - 11720.66] P:1551.43 E:0.025567 |  29 degrees
[11720.66 - 11726.10] P:1486.03 E:0.027148 |  And uh 50 humidity that's not she's oka two years ago, but it's still going to be quite warm and it will take its toll
[11726.18 - 11729.62] P:1671.67 E:0.022764 |  There's certainly been a muggy day here today in the portuguese capital
