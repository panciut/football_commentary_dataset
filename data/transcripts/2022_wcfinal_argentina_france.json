  "transcript": " Their key players into the game. Messi with Di Maria on that right-hand side, up against Southern McConnell. And Hernandez could be the key batter. Well, 29 days ago, this Winter World Cup was under way. And now here we are, match 64. And what a final it is in prospect. Messi against Mbappe. A footballing oasis in the desert. And it is certainly a real dip. Being created by a mass of jumping. Argentinian supporters in the end away towards RL. I think it's fair to say they're excited. It is. And just looking at the Argentine set up. Di Maria started on that left-hand side. I think we all thought he was going to start on the right-hand side. And De Paul will be the one helping out Molina. And doubling up on Mbappe. They narrow off the right. So Argentina are playing from left to right as we look. Here in the banks of the media tribute in this very impressive stadium in the city of Lusail. Nine miles north of Doha. And the other thing to say as well is that this will be the highest attendance for a World Cup final. Since 1994, when there are over 94,000 watching Brazil against Italy. In the United States. It's going to take some time to settle down. Back to Emi Martinez. All in green. He clears it away. Teo Hernandez controls the ball. Rabio plays it out towards Hernandez on this near side. And now back to Abumacano. As De Paul just running into Rabio. And the referee quickly. Polish referee Marciniak wanting to stamp that out. Just a little nudge in the back there from De Paul and Rabio. A bit of a silly shove from De Paul. The position he's playing is going to have to engage in Mbappe on numerous occasions and help out Molina. So what he want is an early cheat booking. Just a little wag of the index finger from the De Paul referee. And quite clearly the message whilst to cut it out is. Argentina take a throw on the left hand side. McAllister to Messi. Central area. Plays the ball left footed out towards Demiria. Demiria hooks over the cross on the volley. Messi waits. Rabio with a header away. De Paul back towards Messi. To De Paul outside the area. Scoops the ball forward. Alvarez is there. Flags up. It was a late play. Has good call. Just straight a yard offside. Was expecting the ball from De Paul a little bit quicker. Just timed his run so that it was a fraction too early from Alvarez. Bucks bright. They're getting Messi on the ball. Getting him in around the penalty area. Argentina have scored first in all six of their World Cup matches here in Qatar. Hugo Larisse all in yellow away towards our right hand side. Strikes it away downfield. Jiru with a flick. Heder Griezmann was also there. Brought under control and then played back towards Romero. Lifted long into the centre circle. Towering header from Upper Mercano. But he's come through the back of Messi. Says the Polish referee. Free kick to Argentina. That's slightly harsh. That was a straight ball clipped up and Upper Mercano is always going to be Messi in the air. He does catch him. I think Didier Deschamps is overly pleased with that decision. It's a World Cup record for Lionel Messi. His 26th appearance. At a World Cup for what is likely to be his fifth and final World Cup finals. Beating the record set by Lota Mateos. And in those previous 25 11 goals and eight assists. As Argentina. Attack on that far side the left. Di Maria trying to come in between two French players. Kunde and Dembele out of play it will go for a throw. Talia Fico will take it quickly. Looking for it to settle. And Bafé comes into the central area to get the ball back for the dark shirts of France. Teo Hernandez is giving away. Straight towards Messi. Lays it off. De Paul driving forward. McAllister making the run through the middle ahead of it. He went out wide towards the left towards Di Maria. And Kunde will clear. France are giving the ball away. They made another error here. Shot comes in from distance. The real tile driver as well from McAllister. But Leriz with his body behind the ball made a comfortable save. As a nervy start from France. Number of mistakes. Leriz straight into the mid-riff. Great ball for the catch. But France has got to get a foot on the ball. Get a hold of it. Get a feel of it. Get into the game. Just as a reminder this is live on BBC One. You can watch and listen through World Cup Extra on the iPlayer. To listen to the five live commentary if you so wish. We have Chris Sutton and Rob Green with us here in Lusail. Nil Nil. The ball is played back. Just need to settle it. Don't they the reigning champions do look nervy? Yes they do. It was a Griezmann who's had such a good tournament. Carelessly giving the ball away. Just outside his own 18-yard box. Which allowed the shot from McAllister. But just trying to get a foothold now. France in the game. Make a few passes. What is interesting is that Argentina have... This is their fifth match that they played here in Lusail. Saudi Arabia and Mexico in the group stages. Netherlands in the Croatia in the knockout stages. This is the first visit to Lusail for France here in this World Cup final. Six minutes play. Dembele right hand side. Back with Kunde. Now to Verran. One of the players who's recovered from illness. Another one is Ufa Macano as the two central defenders exchange passes. Just outside the centre circle. Verran now with Ufa Macano. Lionel Scoloni is out in that technical area. Back with Verran. Not really going anywhere at the moment. If anything they've been crossed slightly backwards here France. This message just runs towards Ufa Macano. And he passes the ball out wide. Talia Fico with interception before it could reach Dembele. Griezmann now takes over. Tchoua many runs through the centre circle on the halfway line. Alvarez who was in pursuit is just pulled back at the arm of Rabio. And it gives away a free kick. Rob. Yeah it's interesting that France when they get the ball. Teo Landa as we know he's likely to go up high. They get converted to a flatback three almost. And that lends itself to Argentina. Pressing man for man. And they're not moving the ball quick enough to cause Argentina problems. In the midfield. Now with Messi for Argentina. Threads a lovely ball through towards McAllister. McAllister has Demiria ahead of him. Streaking away on the left hand side. Alvarez waits. DePaul just on the edge of the area. Held up. There is Demiria on the left. McAllister back inside. This is Fernandez. Short tackle ball cut out by Griezmann. It'll break to Alvarez. Ever alert. Lays it up towards Demiria. Left hand side of the penalty area. With the cut back edge of the area to DePaul. DePaul with a shot. Texting reflection of the legs of Iran. And behind it goes for a corner kick. 0-0. Yeah really positive start from Argentina. Demiria causing problems on that left hand side. Balls across back to DePaul. He's got 20 yards out who hammers the shot. It was actually going well wide. Off for Rams left shin and behind. With corner to Argentina. Argentina have made the better start. Within playing for eight minutes. Messi waits just adjust the ball in the in the quadrant down below. Corner kick on this near side the right. For Argentina playing from left to right. Messi delivers it low. Cleared by Griezmann at the near post. DePaul plays it back out towards Messi. Controls it first time. Looks to try and run at Griezmann. They doubled up on it. And Bapé was helping out Griezmann. DePaul now will send over an arcing cross. Plenty of Navy shirts are back there. It goes high in the air. Rabiot goes to ground. Larise can't get on the end of it. Referee's blown his whistle. There was a foul on Larise who's down. No I'm not a goalkeeping expert. We've got Rob who is but that's that ball goes up in the air. Initially the Rabiot head up. I think Larise has to come for that. It's a really difficult one going up in the nice sky. Swirling around. But you look and you think, can I catch it? As you told him to do in the past, just catch it Larise. I think it's such a high ball and there's so many bodies it can't make that clean claim. He then gets caught by Romero. I think that's his casing point. Just like the supporters. It's been a lively start from the Argentinian players for something. Oh it has been. The team on the front foot. Worrying for Didier Deschamps. Larise down. Took one and the ribs from his top and team mate. Just interesting that he's touched on it before Chris. How Argentina have set up. We thought that he, Maria, start on the right. He's very, very high, very, very wide on the left. And they're looking for him early. And a big switch to get out there. And from there you then say get bodies around it. And that's what they've done well. Has to be concerned though here for Hugo Larise. Romero it was who caught it. I think in fairness to Romero, as the ball goes up in the air, Upa Magano shoves Romero who then flies into Larise. The longer he's down, he's sitting up now which is an encouraging sign. Lent the stoppage though for the French captain. Started five of the six games out here in Qatar. Excellent against England and Morocco. Interesting that he kept three clean sheets in sixth when they won the World Cup four years ago in Russia. He's only kept the one clean sheet so far. But at least he looks able to continue. Gold keepers have gone soft, haven't they? Staying down from that challenge like that. Do you want to respond to that, Rob? It's not nice getting out there. Do you want to respond to that, Rob? It's not nice getting a dig in the ribs in any sense. He's alright after a lengthy stoppage here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Larise clears it long downfield left footed. Giroud tries to get on the end of it. Headed away by Talia Fico, the left back for Argentina. Rabio with a ponytail, heads it forward. Griswold tries to win it back. There was DePaul, McAllister turns out towards Di Maria, far side the left. Talia Fico plays the ball back and Argentina will go all the way back to there. Gold keeper, Emi Martinez. The first Aston Villa player to appear in a World Cup final. Ball sent forward by Fernandez. Alvarez will give chase. Verrante is up towards Larise. Clears it away first time left footed. 12 minutes played, still goal is here in the sail. DePaul, Molina not had chance to get forward so far on this right hand side, the right back. Di Maria controls the ball left hand side, pulls it back, cut out by Tua Menek. Almost reached Messi, still lay attack. DePaul messes on the stretch and then cleared away. Alvarez charges it down from Talia, Hernandez attempted clearance. That's what he gives you Alvarez. It's not just his goal threat and his pace, his work rate. We've seen it in the quarter final and the 75. He's been brilliant. Well, the Argentinian team have started with great intensity. Doesn't give the French defenders the moments peace there and that run just moments before that. He'll do that all evening, stretch that French back line that allows Messi to come into those little spaces that are created to get on the ball and do his thing. Here is Verran midway through his own half. France are in all maybe playing from right to left. This is five-liever, it's still 0-0. Kunde to Dembele, quickly closed down. Dembele though will wriggle free, plays the ball to Tehanandes. Now with a Bapé, a Bapé left corner of the area. First real chance we've had of a Bapé in this game so far to Rabiot. The return ball and Bapé's pace tries to get in there. But the anticipation from Eni Martinez, he was quick to accelerate off his line and he goes down to ground and makes a smothering say. He's quick, he's not that quick. Once it gets beyond the defender, he knows he's got that time to come out. But all of a sudden the intensity of the game just raised once and Bapé got the ball. At the back, cleared away by Romero. Alvarez and Messi exchange a couple of headers. It will run through to McAllister, who quickly sprays it out towards the left. De Maria is attacking on that far side, coming in field now towards Messi. Messi on the edge of the area tries to play the return ball towards De Maria. Coming back from an offside position, sure, yes he was. And that will be a free kick to France. Just wondered there, Messi 25 yards out, whether he was going to get a shot off himself. But he saw the run of De Maria, unfortunately for Argentina. Messi just proceeded the pass of all straight to Kunday. Been playing for nearly a quarter of an hour. Argentina against France. The backdrop of 50,000 Argentinians in this World Cup final. It will sound slightly different on Tuesday night for the first of three successive nights of league. They're back to play you on Five Live when we're at MK Don's against Leicester City. That's for next week as our live football will continue. Wherever you can go though, always remember, BBC Sounds is the place to take Five Live with you. But here we are in Lusseo and it's with Fernandez out towards Molina. Attack minded right back, who plays it now towards Romero. Otter Mendi carries the ball over the halfway line out towards De Maria. Talia Fico. Fernandez left at the centre circle. Fernandez just linking up the play with the central defenders as Romero takes over. Indeed Fernandez now drops in between the two central defenders as the pullbacks are pushed off. And as Talia Fico makes a run in field, De Maria drops just over the halfway line on that left-hand side. And at a walking pace, Argentina are controlling this game. And then Molina tries to make that darting going forward with the ambitious ball, it's too far ahead of him, and it goes out for a France throw. Rob Green. Yeah, it's interesting. Griezmann's the comfort blanket for France when they haven't got the ball. When they want to go and press and risk it a little bit, he steps up out the line. There, they really haven't quite got the game right yet. They haven't tactically got this right yet. So he dropped a lot deeper into midfield and said, right, you've got to play around us. The game slows down, they win the ball back and get a little bit of control again. When they last met at a World Cup in Kazan four years ago, it was the last 16, there'd already been a goal at this stage. It was a Griezmann penalty as the loose ball is picked up by Argentina. Messi to the ball, pullback towards Messi. It'll fall to De Maria and he's skied it. Just inside the penalty area, central position, right footed, couldn't keep it down, goal kick, no, no. Once again, sloppy play this time from Amanda, the French left back, and as the ball is fed in field, Messi picks the ball up and pops it. Out to the right-hand side, De Paul feeds across in. De Maria on his weaker right foot, it just bobbles up slightly. Was he 16 yards out centrally? It's a really poor connection well over the bar, but I think Scoloni will be happy with this start from his Argentinian team. He's playing on the wrong side, isn't he? He should have been coming on his left. Rob Green and Chris Sutton with his 17 minutes played, we're still awaiting the goal. Indeed, you were in that game in Kazan, weren't you? And you went trans-one by four goals to three. In the cooking pot in Kazan and took over that Griezmann penalty, it was that game from a run from Mbappe, the length of the field to win the penalty, but he's barely had a kick so far. And the cooking pot in Kazan to the cauldron of noise in Lusail. Here is Mbappe, near side the left for France, back to Hernandez, goes further back to Upper Meccano, goes square across the back now towards Verran. Verran right at the centre circle, approaches the halfway line. Gunde plays it forward, Dembele now links up with Gunde, but the return ball, Dembele will get there with his face. Although the Argentinian support behind that goal thought that it actually got out of play, we're too far away to tell. France have got to throw right hand side. But we've hardly seen much of France as an attacking force in these opening 18 minutes. As Gunde goes back to Verran, almost midway through the Argentinian half. Now with Upper Meccano, to this near side now to Teo Hernandez. Here is Mbappe, flicks the ball forward, Hernandez goes to ground, referee will give the free kick. Free kick to France in a very dangerous position, about six yards up from the byline, left of the penalty area. Yeah, I think he's better going forward than Hernandez, and he is defensively. He just draws the foul from Romero, the right centre half for Argentina, comes out and brings him down. Clever little touch to get past him, and now this is an opportunity for France. Griezmann wanders over, that wander of a left foot. The French tricolours are flying away towards our right, but our eyes are cast to the left, because that's where Griezmann has placed the ball down. Argentina have everybody back inside their own penalty area. It's Griezmann, left foot, it thinks it's towards the far post, and it was Olivier Giroud, who threw himself at that six yards out, and couldn't keep it down, and it will be a goal kick. Free kick awarded anyway. I don't think Giroud does a lot wrong there. It's above his defender. Jumps early, that's the key. We saw the issues that the Argentinian centre halves had with the Dutch, Giroud. A specialist in the air, scores Romero and Otamende, all sorts of problems if he gets the right service. He's become in this tournament the all-time top scorer for France, and he was looking for what actually would have taken him level with Mbappe and Messi on five goals in order to try and maybe win the Golden Boot here in Qatar. 20 minutes play, still 0-0. What have you made of the 20-minute drop-green? Well, I think that chance just sums up France, doesn't it? They don't play well, they look like they've got the game together, then all of a sudden they pop up two passes, a good free kick and an opportunity for Giroud. Just how France play. Here is Messi, collecting the ball midway through the France half. Molina is the outlet on the right-hand side, back with De Paul. France have everybody back behind the ball. Now it is with Otamende. Fernandez closed down by Griezmann, Romero inside the centre-circle as it goes back. De Paul on the halfway line, plays it forward. Fernandez is able to turn, runs through towards McAllister, they play it out towards the left, quickly feeding it towards De Maria. De Maria cuts inside, De Maria is done well. De Maria goes down and the referee gives the penalty. They've bundled over from behind. And you know what this means. But little Messi will have the opportunity to give Argentina the lead. It's brilliant play on the byline from De Maria, shapes across the ball in, left-footed, and he drives inside Dembélé, and there is contact from Dembélé. It's a clumsy challenge from him. We know De Maria doesn't need a second invitation to go down. He goes down. It'll be checked by Thomas Wietkowski, the Polish VAR. Well, it won't get overturned because he's got the wrong side of him and he makes contact. It's so, so soft from a France point of view. Dembélé sells himself out wide and then just makes the faintest of contact. De Maria looked up, knew that there was no options in the penalty area, and was like, please, just make contact. I'm going to go down and he duly applies. Little Messi's already scored three penalties. He did, of course, miss against Poland, but he's only missed on four occasions in his international career out of 28 attempts. Lionel Messi to what would be his sixth goal of this tournament. Runs up now, left-footed, and scores. The little man for the big occasion. And Lionel Messi is absolutely swamped by his teammates. We all know what the missing piece is in his illustrious career, and he has got the breakthrough goal. And Argentina lead France by a goal to nil. He was never going to miss. One nil. Listen to this noise. You're right, he was never going to miss. Just slows his run up down a little bit. Larisse goes to his right-hand side with Messi is watching him all the way, just tops it in the other corner. Cool as you like, the coolest man inside the stadium. Great start for Argentina. We have work to do. We are midway through the first half. You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. And to take you through the halftime, here's that correspondent John Murray. Well, thanks, Ian. And Lionel Messi now crosses the halfway line, having just scored in a World Cup final. He's just done something that Diego Maradona did not do. And as you walk back from the celebrations, the frenzied celebrations down close to the corner flag, he just raised his fist and punched the air. And Argentina have the edge over France. Argentina on the back foot now, but the noise inside the Luce El Stadium here, all around us. Yes, and Bapes slips the ball into the penalty area, but he doesn't find a teammate. And now Argentina break again, Alvarez, and then a back heel flick from McAllister knocks it back down into the left-back position, where Talia Fico plays it out of play. Off the man who conceded the penalty, Dempale. So Lionel Messi scores his 97th international goal. And that is his 12th at World Cups, which means that he now moves alongside Pelle in terms of the total number of goals scored at World Cup finals tournaments. Everything he does, there is a milestone attached to it, but what he really wants is that golden trophy in his hands. And with that penalty, he's put Argentina in full position. Rob Green, well, the way that they've started, and how poor France have been really sitting in this open course of the game, there's an opportunity for more, we saw against Croatia that they almost ran away with the game once they crowd got up, once they got lifted, Croatia couldn't respond. France have got to up it now because this could run away. They've been the better team, now they have the lead. Argentina looking to win the World Cup for the first time since 1986. And France though winning the ball back, here's Giroux, but Giroux quite strongly challenged. He was by the Argentine defender, came in at pace. Giroux went down Chris Sutton, France have a free kick and a good position. Yes, about what? 30 yards out, Ramero, strong challenge. Into the back of Giroux. I mean, what the Argentinian goal might do, should do, you think, is liven this French team up a little bit. They have been way off the pace this opening, 25, 26 minutes. Well, it is a free kick after Ramero's challenge, so that was Tottenham on the former Arsenal Chelsea man Giroux free kick. Griezmann's going to take it, but referee Marciniac says, hang on a minute, hang on, blows his whistle because there's been a collision on the edge of the box. Giroux is trying to help up the player who went down, who is Enzo Fernandez. And Enzo Fernandez wasn't for the hand of friendship there, Chris, as it was offered by Giroux very gallantly. Well, there's not going to be too many hands of friendship, it's coming together. Giroux catches Fernandez who stooped down, Giroux catches him with his forearm. And he's still at him Giroux. Now, as Griezmann will take it, left footed into the penalty area, but that's effectively headed away. Then nodded back over the top by Theo Hernandez. He was caught late, I think in fact he's a judge to have committed the foul. Theo Hernandez, and it's the Argentine players down, and the referee's immediately called for the medical people to come on because it was a clash of heads. Between, well, Messi, it's not a clash of heads, he's been caught on the side of his shoulder, I would say. So, and that is guilty of winning a header. And that's it, it's an incredible decision. I would take a punt that if that wasn't Messi going down, the referee wouldn't have given a free kick to Argentine. And what a position the free kick would have been in for France. But you can't give free kicks against Lionel Messi. Free kick given to Argentina. Argentina lead France by Juan Goultonel in this FIFA World Cup final, here in Doha, on actually what feels like quite a cool evening. And it feels like there's a breeze blowing around the ground. But that's the air conditioning inside this stadium. It's actually a very pleasant evening outside. I'm not even sure they would necessarily need to have switched it on. But the temperatures are cool inside. But this World Cup final is warming up. And certainly that moment, that Lionel Messi goal-scoring moment. Even though it's from the penalty spot, that's what all of these Argentina fans were dreaming of when they came here. Hugo Lloris set the wrong way, Rob. Yep, it's an awful one for a goalkeeper. Just the pause, the weight and the look. And you know as soon as he looks at you, any ink in, any flinch, he's going the other way. Here he is now, Messi down the right-hand side. But in comes the challenge from Teo Hernandez to block it behind for another corner to Argentina. Almost half an hour play. This is five-live from the BBC. Listeners well via BBC sounds. There's still time to take the World Cup with you on BBC sounds. And we're also across Africa on the World Service. And it is a corner. Lionel Messi way down in the corner. A little bearded figure. Those shorts that come right down to his knees, left it into the near post and it's headed away. Jiru actually in between two Argentinians. And then the offside flag is up as Messi takes the ball under control. And it's a free kick to France in their own left-back position. Argentina won. France, Nile. Chris Sutton. Yes, really good defending from Jiru. Good ball in from Messi. They put it in, swing up. Jiru good in the air in both boxes. So it is a free kick for France. Lionel Messi incidentally as well becomes the first man to score in a World Cup final for Argentina since 1986. Since they last won it. The last goal was scored by Jorge Borrechaaga who scored the third goal when they won 3-2 against the then West Germany. That was Diego Maradona's team as I say. He didn't score in that final. It was Lota Mateos who was looking after him. All of his teammates stepped up and Argentina won it. And they're winning this one. And he has Di Maria with the cross from the left hand side but it's good for the two on that. And it's out of play for a throwing in the left-back position. That was the wild card selection. If you want to call it that from Lionel Scaloni. See Di Maria over there put his hands on his head in anguish. But he brought him in to start and he started him on the left hand side and Messi on the right. Yeah and he's a full ball in but what it does do is make the pitch a lot bigger for Argentina. Him holding out wide. Then they've got the options to find other players. And France haven't come up with an answer yet. No they haven't. And it is Argentina in the famous blue and white striped shirts, white shorts, white socks who have the ball and it's played back into central defence. And Otomendi and Romero are there. Nicholas Otomendi the former Manchester City man tonight. Incidentally winning his 100th cap in the World Cup final. Doesn't get much better than that. Particularly if you go on to win it. And they are one nil up. And here is DePaul on the right hand side. The joker in the pack they call it. Plays it back to Messi. Messi now through the middle. Alvarez is there. Back to Messi. This is middle of the heart. Messi turns away from Griezmann. And now with his right foot, clips the ball out. DeMaria is going to do well to reach that. The ball bounced up. The assistant says he did manage to get under control before it bounced over the line. Back it comes to McAllister. The Brighton man's made a very good start to this game. I must say it. Here he is again on the left hand side. The first Brighton and Hall-Valbyan player to play in a World Cup final. And it's come back to him but he rather snatched at the shot. And it's bounced out of play way over here. On the right hand side for a throw in to France. Chris Sutton. Bit of a commentator's curse there. John Haslubal came back to him. 25 yards out. Left hand side of the box. Slashes the ball out wildly for a throw in on the far side of the pitch. We're all guilty of that. But one time or another. As you may know, Chris by the way will be hosting 606 tonight. A Doha Sulford edition of 606. Robbie Sandwich and Chris Sutton taking it calls. He has Messi. Messi now just outside the area. Moving from right to left. Upa Mercano went with him and put in the challenge. Went to ground. He had to make it. He did. Could tackle from Upa Mercano. Now it's back with Argentina again. DePaul on the right hand side. Right foot across to the back post. Kunde heads that out to the edge of the area in Dempale. Is able to flick it further away. France just can't get out. And Argentina having taken the lead. They are right on top. They've not taken the foot off the accelerator pedal since they took the lead. Here's McCullis for a game they'll have you touch with him. And the pressure from Choumény. And it's out for a throw in for France. Yeah, McCullis has had a really good start to this game. Making some good forward runs. They're on that inside left with Maria just hanging out on the touch line. And causing problems. All the talk before the game about Messi, Vy and Bapay. Bapay's barely touched the ball. Yeah, it's just seen really the only odd glimpse of what Kille and Bapay might be able to do. If it was a contest between Messi and Bapay, then it is Messi who's winning that one. France have got it all to do. They just, moments, they're just smashing the ball anywhere. There's no control in there moments ago. They had that throwing in their own half. And within two passes, Messi was taking a shot on goal. And it's just from their own throwing. It's basic stuff for France at the moment. They just can't get it right. They're looking around Choumény, doesn't know where he should be playing. Griezmann's having to drop in to help him out. And in turn, they just can't get out their own half. Argentina won France nil with just over 10 minutes to go to halftime. And it is Argentina with the ball. Here is DuPaule with those socks disappearing around his calves. Back in the central defence, the men DuPaule takes it again. He's got no one in a deep blue shirt anywhere near him. So he gives it to Messi to his right. Why wouldn't you? Messi clips it left footed right across field to Di Maria with those two wristbands on. Di Maria now back to Messi just outside the area. Rabiot put in the challenge and that men bounced away back towards Fernandez. Closer to the halfway line. Fernandez receives it again. Benfica man, another hot property. Benfica who made this undeaten start of the season. That's where Autumn Endi is playing now. So two Benfica players in this Argentine side. And it goes back into the centre circle. Argentina dominating possession as well as everything else. And actually it goes all the way back to the Aston Villa man, Martinez, who's barely been tested yet. And they're knocking the ball around with some confidence. Argentina. It looked so comfortable and they got space. They got... Well, John, you've done it again. Uh-huh. Yes. Yes. As the ball was played to the right hand side to Molina with some pace. Now Mbappe takes on the right side to defender Romero. Went past him but the cover was there and Argentina were able to clear it. Scaloni urging his team on from the edge of the coaching area. So up on McCona put in the challenge but Argentina running rings around. France and Alvarez plays it forward and McAllister hits it across. And Di Maria is there! Two-nil Argentina! France lost it on the halfway line and Argentina were absolutely ruthless. And it's Di Maria, the man for the big occasion. The man Scaloni brought back in for the final. Who gives his team a two-nil lead before halftime. Argentina too. The holders, France, Niel. Absolutely ruthless. Argentina there. There was a ball. Helped onto Messi and two quick touches. Fixed the ball up left footed outside of the left boot. And then McAllister's away. Makes a forward run. And on the right hand side of the box could have taken a shot on himself. But had the awareness, had the composure to find Di Maria and waits the ball perfectly. It allows Di Maria to just move onto the ball seamlessly. And he actually, I think he chokes the ball down into the floor over Larisse. Maybe gets a little bit lucky. Otherwise that's absolutely genius from Di Maria. But Argentina are blowing this French team away. It's brilliant. Counter-attack in one touch, football. And it is a brilliant finish. It's Neza Urzalesc playing back in the Arsenal days where he deliberately bumps it into the ground and over Larisse. Complete wave of blue and white to our left in front of us. Just went up. That's the comfort that they needed. That's the one that they deserve from this first half. Because France have not thrown a punch to Nill to Argentina in the 2022 World Cup final. And all of these Argentine supporters who've come here in their thousands. They reckon 50,000 Argentina fans are here in Doha, in Qatar to witness this. What they hope would be their first World Cup triumph since 1986. And with this scoreline, it looks very possible that it will be. The holders have got an awful lot to do from here. Well, I'm baffled by Deschamps that it's 37 minutes into the game and he's not changed it. We're set up here. Everyone can see it. It's just not working. What they're doing isn't working. It needs to change. They're sleeping, walking their way to defeat. They could have already lost it by now. And what a scene we have. Down to our left behind the goal that Ami Martinez is defending. What a scene. Blue and white of Argentina. So many of them on their feet. They couldn't sit down for this. They couldn't sit down for this. And they are singing. They're cheering. They're waving their flags. And at the front of that section as well, so many blue and white Argentina flags and so many images of the face as well of Diego Maradona. And now the ball is played up for France, but in steps from Aero. And Argentina will come forward again. And it's played for Messi. And Messi up against Obamacano, who is rather caught out incidentally for the second goal. Obamacano dived in on the halfway line. Was caught out of position. France were all over the place. And Argentina really took advantage of the space. He's the one who gave it away as well. Desperation just to win it back. You knew as soon as he did that, they were away. Whether they could be clinical, they were. Argentina too. France, 0. Halftime approaching. And the world champions, France, are going to have to pull something truly traumatic out to turn this around. Messi, still plenty of time though. Messi inside his own half, just taps the ball back into central defence. And Ottenenbi gives it out to the left-hand side. And it looks as though France are going to make a change. Marcus Turand has been called forward by Didier Deschamps. The son of his old teammate, Lillian Turand. And that change is going to be made before halftime. You said it, the two of you, that he had to be proactive. He had to do something, Didier Deschamps. And he's not going to wait until halftime. And it looks as though it's going to be a double change he's going to make. So desperate times calling for desperate measures for the World Cup holders. Argentina are in possession. Argentina with it on the right-hand side. Molina, but then Chumeni is able to hook it forward. But there's no one there in a dark blue shirt. Giroud will chase it. But it's played forward by Romero. And now Molina again to De Paul, who will go back into central defence. So a double change for something. Yeah, Turand came on and he'll play off the left-hand side. So it looks... Called by Kunde on the far side. It looks as if Mbappe will go and play centre-forward. And Mouane, the goal scorer, came off the bench to score against Morocco. He'll go on the right-hand side. So it looks like Dembele will be the one to make way. And Olivia Giroud, I think. Yep, that's right. It is. The red number nine is up. So Giroud and Dembele off before half-time in the World Cup final. What a disappointment. And for Olivier Giroud, 36. You know, he almost certainly never got an opportunity like this again. And he's not last at the first half. And four goals at this World Cup. Such a totem for them as well when they won four years ago. And that's it. It's Nikes Auber, ruthless. Remarkable decision that. Taking off the all-time leading goal scorer. And when the one thing that you do need is goals. Just watching there, there was a little acknowledgement between Deschamps and Giroud. And France have been so flat. I mean, listen, we've talked as well over the last few days about this virus that has run through the French squad. I think you have to consider whether that is a factor in what we're witnessing here. Because they have been so flat. But then again, this is not completely out of keeping with the way that they've played up this World Cup. Argentina have just dominated them. So a double change. And Turand and Colomboani have come on. And Bapé is now playing through the middle. But a free kick has been conceded by the French. Brafowl over there on the far side. So it's a free kick to the team that lead by two goals to Nile. So two of the most experienced men in World Football have scored the goals. Lionel Messi from the penalty spot with the opener. So he now leads the top scoring standings. Six goals at this World Cup. So Messi scoring the opening goal as he wins his 172nd cap. And Angel Di Maria as he wins his 130th. And it is Argentina who are backed by this Geffrin and Coris from their supporters. Di Maria on the left hand side. Di Maria taking on Cundé. Fences off the French right back. He's just able to get to it and play it forward. But Colomboani is caught in possession. But the tackle actually causes the ball to run back over the dead ball line. And it is a goal kick to France. Rob. You're looking at France now and you're looking at whether they've changed shape or great deal. And it's Turand who's holding higher on the left hand side. Realistically, they've got two minutes to get through to half time. And Deschamps will have to have the team talk of his life to get anything. Any semblance out of this. So Argentina looking good. Playing the ball out and it bounces off Alparez. Trumani, that's a nice piece of footwork from him. It's a rabbi-off. But Argentina are tigerish. And De Paul is into the tackle on Turand. And the ball's deflected out of play for a throw. And the tail of Hernandez is going to take to Trumani. I mean, their tails are up. They're confident. They're not allowing France to settle on the ball. And it really looks from the position that they're in here. That there is that absolute hunger here. Not to give France a sniff. Not to give them a glimmer. And the French have been forced back halfway into their own half. Here is Verran, who will carry the ball forward towards the halfway line. He was one of the players who was doubtful because of that virus. Obama-Cano as well, coming back into the team. Canate is among the substitutes, incidentally. As the ball is played forward through the middle to Bafé. And the challenge that came in on him from Romero just caught him. Referee Marciniak gives the pre-cate France his way. He's playing on the edge, Romero. Tottenham fans won't be surprised by me saying that. That's about three or four in this half that he's been a little bit reckless and gone in a little bit rash and fortunate not to get booked so far. Pre-cate taken by France. We're in the last minute of the first half. Five live on the World Service from the BBC. Listen as well on BBC Sounds. Ball played through the... And Bafé, that in comes the challenge. And Argentina have got it again, but it's given away. This is, essentially, with Mouane. That in comes the challenge this time. Again from Romero, comes back at the Argentine defence. That's cleared away by Molina. And there's Messi, half-reinside his own half. Just working the ball back to Molina on the right-hand side. Molina turns it infield. Turan was there as well. Fourth official way down below just flashes the number on the electronic board. Now he can see it's seven minutes of added time. Not sure what we've seen in the first half. Particularly married seven minutes. So, of course, we had the stoppage for Maurice. Yeah, Maurice was down for a while, wasn't he? But actually a couple at the other end as well. Just defensively, Argentina defending with so much greater intensity. That battle in the middle of the park, Argentina really dominant there. As the ball is played over the top 10, the left-hand side. I think what we heard there was Angel Di Maria screaming for a free kick. He went down. I think it was either that or one of those children's toys. It was a scream of a thought of having to run another 50 yards after 45 minutes of football. It's Kunde with the challenge. And Di Maria went down, as Chris suggested. Sometimes he goes down, but there's not an awful lot wrong with him. But he's been pivotal, hasn't he? He's won the penalty and he scored the second goal Di Maria having bought. Being brought back in by the coach, Lionel Scoloni. And he's watching on. He's been there right on the edge of the coaching area the full-time. Track suit manager. Track suit bottoms, trainers on. Watching the ball being played forward, which deflects out to Mbappe, who has actually come out to the left-hand side, looks for Turan. The long legs of Marcus Turan, takes it on down the line, tries to work it back. But there are two, three Argentine players, and then there's a high foot from Teo Hernandez onto Paul, who went straight down. referee will come across. I think that's a final warning for Teo Hernandez, who actually throws the ball away in disgust as he's sent on his way by the referee. Three-kick Argentina, they lead 2-0. They've absolutely dominated the first half of this World Cup. Yep, absolutely. And they don't have to defend ferociously, don't they? They fight, they scrap, they harry. They do everything ferociously, Chris. They absolutely do, but. Did you listen to them sing the national anthem? Ferocious. Well, passionate. Is there a difference, John, a little bit? Passion, bordering on ferocity. They've been the dominant team, haven't they? They've out-thought, out-worked, out-thought. The French team, and as Rob said, Tidio de Chomp has made a couple of changes already, but you're going to have to have a drastic turnaround, a halftime, to try and somehow get back into this game. It's going to have to be transformational, what they do in this match. To turn this around from two-nil down in a World Cup final, when they have just been bossed, as they say. Here is Molina playing it through. Sebrechaan's Argentina might have gotten another one before halftime. It's played through for Alvarez, but Veran comes across and puts it out of play. And it's a throwing full Argentina down the right-hand side. Argentina, who don't forget are the reigning South American champions winning that last year. That was Messi's first senior international title. And how that was celebrated, winning it as they did in the Maracanar against Brazil. And then beat the European champions Italy in that one-off finalissima earlier this year. And now they're dominating the World Champions, the World Cup holders, France. At the moment, it looks as though it is going to be Argentina, not France, who will get that third star on their shirts. Ball is with Otramendi at the back. You might have thought that these days in the big time were finished when he left Manchester City, 34 years old now, but as I say, Benfica doing great things. And here he is on the verge of winning a World Cup. France coming forward. We've had almost four minutes of added time at the end of this first half. And it's Veran in the orange boots. He looks forward, but goes square. They look bereft, France. They look short on ideas. Turan. Turan tries to dance in field, but they're there again. Those ferocious Argentines, two men on him in dives. Molina with the challenge, gets a bit of the ball, got a bit of the man as well. He won't worry about that. And then France take the throwing back to Obamacano and across to Veran in the centre circle. He plays it across to Kunde. Kunde looks up. Griezmann's another one. We're talking about him before the game. Maybe the player of the World Cup. He's not featured in the final. Anonymous. And that's France's performance in total. It's been anonymous and just bereft of ideas. And really, they're making it up as they go along now. The shape's gone, the team's gone, the pattern of play's gone. They're just looking at someone saying, please turn up. Argentina are leading France by two goals to nil. And the ball's out of play for throwing on the far side. And again, those... I mean, what a scene we have here in this stadium. And I know so much has been said and written about the construction of these stadiums. But in terms of the visual site, as you look around it, with all of the gold lettering and gold trimming, and the way that it undulates around the top, those curving lines, and the roof above our heads, it is a fitting scene for a World Cup final. As the throwing is taken over on the far side by Argentina. It's cleared away on the edge of the box by Upe McCarno. Comes back for Argentina. Griezmann slides in against Di Maria and is able to get the ball away. And then Cunde puts in the challenge, and that comes off the Frenchman. And it's out of play for a throw in to Argentina down the left-hand side. In the sixth minute of added time at the end of the first half. Messi just knocks it back centrally and all the way back now into the centre circle. Where Christian Romero looks up, finds the pass to Di Maria. No, it's over his head and out of play for a throw in to France. Ten yards inside the run. But that's their outball. They've always known, they've always got that, and they play with the comfort of knowing that. Culembroani now is able to dart forward, income the Argentinians, one of them got a touch on him. It's given us a free kick. Here we go. And Argentinian player has dropped to the ground on the far side. And it was played past him by Culembroani. And Fernandez has gone down. And it was played past him whether there was contact there as Culembroani was trying to wriggle away through. Sure, there's an awful lot on that. He went down Culembroani, won the free kick, and then Fernandez went down and he's not good up yet. And referee Marciniac is not allowed the physios onto the field a lot, I think as he does that. It's a yellow card for him, for Fernandez, for putting in the challenge. It should have been Otamenda who was booked. I thought he was the one who made the challenge, but then Fernandez, embarrassing from him. I think he was claiming he was struck by Muani. He's up on his feet now, but that's shocking from him. Free kick then. Well, this is our chance for France to try and pull something out of the fire. Griezmann plays it in all the way towards the back post, but Baran couldn't get there. It was well beyond him, and it's all the way through for the goal kick. Of course, in this sort of position now, there is no Elidia Giroud having been substituted in the A-Dacion, feeling that he had to make that double change in what, the 41st minute, just because of the way that the whole thing was running away from the Demboulian Giroud off the halftime whistle goes. What a half of World Cup final football for Argentina. They were actually surrounding the referee. Martinez, the goalkeeper, has gone there and his teammates have pushed him away. And actually the referee says to him, just go on, off you go. Go to the dressing room, and it will be an extremely satisfied Argentina dressing room at halftime. They lead through the Lionel Messi penalty, and that goal from Angel Di Maria, the blister encounter attack, and it really, you think, can that possibly be a way back for France? The only hope that you're looking at now is that Didier Deschamps turned around. It's like, we can't play any worse. Just go, just go for it. One goal, we saw what happened against the Netherlands with Argentina. With this backing, it might get nervous, but they just look so comfortable, and France have looked so short of ideas. It's been a walk in the park from... Thank you, Rob Green. Thank you, Chris Sutton. Halftime here in Lusail. Argentina 2, France 0. Chris Sutton, stat man's tweeted to say, Di Maria going in at left wing has been a masterclass from Scoloni. First manager to properly target Cundes. It's not where we were expecting him to play. No, absolutely. We thought it'd start on that right-hand side. He didn't, and it was a, you know, you'd say you'd say, tactical genius at this moment in time. I think where the half was won for the Argentinians, though, in that central midfield area, they were getting overloads in there. Messi was dropping deep and getting on the halftime. They were trying to feed the ball out left to the left to Di Maria. But France have been really out of work. Second balls, the Argentinians have been picking up all the time. And as Rob said, it's been a really flat French performance. I mean, talk about illness in the camp this week, but there's, you know, I mean, maybe that is an excuse, but Argentina have blown them away. And when they lose possession, they've actually gone after the French team as well and pressed them fairly high, but they have been so dominant. And at this moment in time, it's hard to see Argentina letting this game slip. I mean, the stats, aside from the score line, just emphasise how dominant Argentina have been. They've been 59% possession compared to 41% for the French. Six shots for Argentina, none for the French. Three of those on target, three off target, nearly 300 passes for Argentina, just over 200 passes for France. Julien Laurent has joined us at halftime. I'm fairly sure that you mailed, as you came to put your headphones on and take the microphone, all that was bad at me. That was bad, yeah. I don't think they'd be crashing any parties tonight. If we get invited, we'll be lucky to the post match Argentina party. I mean, I think it was almost perfect from the Argentines, I have to say. I heard what Cristus said. I think they've been so good in everything they've done. They've lost the midfield, they win the second ball, they press really well. Alvarez is a machine. They're good on the counterattack on the second goal. They're very good in possession. Of course, it's a mistake by Dembele on the first goal, who should not fail Demaria. And by the way, we were thinking Demaria would play on the right. He plays on the left and a coup de deux to the sword. So, well done to Argentina. I mean, Deschamps has never subbed one player, let alone two players so early in the game ever, in the 10 years that he's been in charge of this team. And I think when you change two players after 40 minutes, there's really something wrong. And I don't know if they can come back in this game. I mean, the Dutch came back, but it was a... They look so dominant in Argentina. I can see that. France have got no... They look all over the place. I see they look all over the place without a plan. And actually on the ball, they are making mistake after mistake after second. And I think we all take your point that Argentina repressed them and they've harried them and they haven't given them any time on it. But even towards the end there, the ball was passed back to Verano one point, and he just let it go under his foot and had to go back 20 yards to go and get it, to then restart the move. It's been sloppy. Very sloppy. I think sloppy is the word in possession with Storch Griezmann. Even before the penalty, there are few balls that are in the last 30 yards where it's a bad pass, it's a bad touch, the ball comes again. It happens in the worst game that could happen in this tournament. That's the thing. And I think Argentina has to have forced those mistakes, of course, but you're right. The French just didn't turn up in time. And I think now they can regret it because there could even be three or four downs. They don't have an identity, a style of player brand of football. That's the way it looks throughout this tournament. You know, going into the game, I think we all thought it was going to be, you know, certain moments in this game. I don't think any of us saw one team would dominate as much as they have in this first half. But Argentina are just dictating this whole game so far. It's difficult to see France actually responding in the second half because they have no defined style. And now the panic has set in and Bafé has ascended forward. But how are you going to feed him? They can't get the ball to Griezmann. They can't get the ball to Rabiot on the half-turn and Slide passes in. I mean, that's the problem. Yeah, you're right. And we said we highlighted Griezmann before the start of the game. And we said that if they have a plan against him and if they can keep him away from the game, then I think they will dominate that midfield. And after that, this is where we can't really react. And that's exactly what happens. But the identity was never... It's not so much a problem of identity. It's before we've been ruthless. And that mistake by Dembele on the first goal is a terrible mistake that he should not be making. And they haven't made those mistakes before. On the second goal, I think should let the ball go out. The ball is for us. I don't know why he's trying to control the ball by the touchline and then trying these very difficult passes. And after that, the counterattack is on. And it's an amazing counterattack. Nothing away from the Argentines, but help massively by the French again and how poor they were, even tactically, how they set up on that pitch for the second goal. If the France haven't had a shot on goal, I mean, that's... So, you know, you're saying it's not about identity, but it sort of is in a way, because they don't look like threatening the... Yeah, no, no, one man by that. Usually Griezmann is at the heart of everything. The ball goes wide, he'll go on there, and Kylian on the left-hand side. He crosses in, Dembélé. But there's nothing of that tonight. And I think, again, this is the wrong time, the worst time to have an off there. So what are we going to expect from Muane then? Because he's a player who I've not seen so much. But what are they going to get different from Dembélé off that side? Well, the thing is, Chris, he's a centre-forward. That's playing wide now, which I am a bit struggling. Giroud, I can understand why you're taking him off. Dembélé, I'm a bit more struggling, unless you thought that mistake just took him out of the game. For Colomani, the pace is going forward. He's going to take on defenders. He's a young kid. He was not supposed to be here. He's only here because of injuries. He was in Japan on holidays when they called him and said, could we go injured? Please come back. He's here, and he will play with that kind of... Not really thinking and going for it. Same with Marcus Turham on the other side. I just don't think he's seen enough right now against the team as dominant and as experienced as this Argentine team. Michael Richards is also with us. Michael, you thought this one might be feisty, and certainly towards the end of the first half, Tempest came a little bit close to bubbling over, but it's been a really flat performance from France as we've just been discussing with Jules. What did Argentina do right here? And obviously, there was the unexpected positioning of Demarie on the left rather than on the right, and it seems to work for them. I just think the first goal killed the game. I don't think it was a penalty. I know, I think the majority of you lot think it was. It was already going down, and then Messi goes and scores. Argentina built confidence. They could go in a low block at times and then counterattack like they did for the second goal. I think the first goal just absolutely killed the game, but in fairness, Argentina in the midfield. We talked about Griezmann, the man who should nullify the space that Griezmann can get on their ace. He's been trying to drop deep, but what's happened normally with France is, they're using Griezmann today. Everything is going through Messi. Messi is the person who's dictating the flow and the rhythm of the game. That midfield three-miker for Argentina has absolutely dominated it. It's dominated it out of possession, and it's dominated it in possession. Statman senses the Alexis McAllister first half numbers, 92% pass accuracy, 37 touches, 4 out of 5. I mean, he's put ground, Jules won. Tackles to you and me. 1 out of 1 dribble completed, 1 key pass, 1 big chance created. He's run that midfield, really. And Rodrigo de Poz probably had his best game of the tournament. It's been brilliant to see, because what they're doing, they're all played in that, and we thought Ferreiras was going to play. It was a big decision. We have to, I've already mentioned it before, but to bring Dima here, and he's playing the other side, it'd be outstanding. But what has allowed the other three is to just hold their positions, and in batting, can't get in the game. Every time a batting gets the ball, De Paul is going out there, and blocking the pass into it. Then Fernandez is picking up the pieces, and occupying the space where Griezmann would normally get in the ball. And the McAllister's popping up in areas where... McAllister's at Brighton. He looks like he's a real Madrid player. I'm actually... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Brighton have played some very, very good football this season. No, no, no, no. Brighton have. But no, Brighton played good football for years. I'm not saying that, but I'm saying, he looks like he's played at a level that... The top level for three or four years? He's been absolutely outrageous. I think what they've done well there, and what Liam Elmessi has done well, is that he stood in front of Teo and Ernest, and just... It's taken Rabio out of the game, that he's had to stand in front and protect that ball in. And Teo Mane's looked lost in there, hasn't he? Because it's such a hard task against that. Yeah, completely, and I think Julian Alvarez, who again we mentioned, slightly quickly before the game, is doing an amazing job on Truamene, cutting those passes. And the runs and the press, I don't know if people can see on television, for them watching on television, but from here, Alvarez is just a machine, he's incredible, and everything, every time someone has the ball, there's not a second before Alvarez comes, and presses and hassles him, and it's just fantastic, and he does exactly that on Truamene, and I think Truamene didn't expect it. And that's the thing again, we thought maybe Messi and Alvarez would play on their run-up front, and there would be a bit more time for Truamene, but the fact that they play with the front three, and Alvarez is clearly sticking on Truamene, is a big problem for us. But are we being harsh on Teo Mane? But because he's getting exposed in there, but they're getting outnumbered in there, McAllister made that good run for the goal on the right-hand side, but he's playing quite high up on the left-hand side. Couldn't they can't come in with McAllister, because he has to occupy Di Maria, so that's the French problem. And then two minutes getting dragged. OK, we're going to be harsh on the newsreader in a minute, because we won't get the news in before the second half starts. By the way, just one thing, when Kelly talked about it getting feisty towards the end of the first half, she was actually talking about up here, because that French commentator in front of us, she has stood up for the whole 45 minutes, and Kelly's close to chining her at the moment, I'll be honest with you. Oh, I'm with you. She's like our very own Paredes. I can't see who that is. Well, I love the words. Thanks, Jules. Merci. He's spreading vicious and untrue rumors about me. I'll be in touch with HR at the end of this one. I'll share, as they call it in France. Alexis McAllister is there, taking up a lot of the conversation this halftime. He becomes the first Brighton player to play at the World Cup final, and Sy Lloyd tweeted to say, I haven't seen a McAllister with so much freedom at this time of year, since Kevin's family decided to spend Christmas in Paris. We'll bring you the second half with Argentina, two nil up against France in the World Cup final after the BBC News. Listen on BBC Sounds. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thank you, Kelly.

BBC Five Live, The FIFA World Cup, Qatar 2022 with Mark Chapman and Kelly Cates. Teams are back out for the second half. Just a couple of other quick bits of news. The FA have confirmed that Kara Saaket will continue as England manager until after Euro 2024. And Pakistan ended day two of the third test on 21 without loss. England earlier scored 354. Said a lead by 29 runs commentary on our sports section from 4.45 tomorrow morning. If you go to the iPlayer, you can find World Cup extra. You can watch the pictures from BBC One, but listen to our commentary and you'll be very pleased to know that a diplomatic incident was avoided thanks to the negotiating skills bizarrely of Chris Sutton. The commentator in front has indeed Assein Foud. Ian Dennis. Thank you, Mark. About to get underway. Another side has made a change at the start then of this second half where Argentina are leading by two goals to nil. And if you recall when they played the Netherlands in the quarterfinals, that was the first time that Argentina when they were two up and they were pegged back by the Dutch. That was the first time in World Cup history that they failed to win. So that gives you the size and the task that a face is France here in Lussel. Although of course the success to the Dutch was to leave on the big or bring on the big man in Valtvegghorst and France have taken off their big man in Olivier Giroud with a couple of changes that they made in the in the first half. But Argentina well worth a 2-0 lead as Alvarez picks up the ball and runs forward from Messi's pass. It goes out towards to Paul just outside the penalty area back towards Alvarez, right corner of the box. Now he goes into a central area played forward by Fernandez, but Cališta was almost there and Hugo Lloris diving forward all in yellow. Haven't even had chance to give you the two teams. Emi Martinez is in goal for Argentina. Molina Romero, Ottoman Italy Fico, McAllister Fernandez to Paul and Di Maria, Alvarez and Messi and France have Lloris in goal. Cunde Uppamikano, Veram Teo Hernandez, Griezmann, Schuemeni Rabio and Bafi Tiram and Kohler Muwadi. I would have thought at halftime, did he, the shot would have read the French team the right act and talked about starting fast and Cunde switched off there. And McAllister nearly got on the end of it. Fernandez pass from the central area. Also with the Giroud departure, it means that the record of Nils Lidholm of Sweden remains intact to become the oldest ever goal scorer in a World Cup final. As Tuer Mene, back with Veram, but they've got it all to do, France, and they've got to they've got to really put in a vastly improved display in this second period, Rob Green. Yeah, we can talk about tactics, you can talk about whatever you want, but they sleptwalk through that first half to a 2-0 deficit. They've just got to wake up, they've got to liven up, they've got to ask a different question and Bap is now demanding it off his player, shouting his teammate. He's got to get on the ball and get in the game. Here is Veram, to Upper McCarno. The noise levels haven't changed, we're still surrounded by joyous Argentinians as a lot of the the corporate seats are still yet to be filled over on that far side, but Argentina leading by two goals to nil. And the second goal as well was just a goal of pure beauty. McAllister to Messi who just tickled it around the corner to Alvarez. McAllister continued his run breaking through and then unselfishly spread the ball to Dimaria. It was a stunning second goal from Argentina and early in the second half here on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds or indeed taking up the option that Mark Chapman had said to watch on BBC One and listen to the 5 Live commentary that is also available to you through World Cup Extra on the iPlayer, but Argentina in their white and sky blue striped shirts and white shorts are playing from right to left and were four minutes into the second half. It's a direct throw and now it falls to the feet of around the edge of the area back towards Larisse, clears it away all in yellow. Talia Fico will get there first before Colin Mouane who tries to get some support from Kunde. Babbling for every loose ball but it's Kunde who brings it away and goes inside but stepping forward with Romero. Excellent defending there towards Messi and now towards Dimaria, left corner of the area. Dimaria crosses it, go into the ground with DePaul right footed saved by Larisse. The next goal is crucial in this game. Oh absolutely, Argentina get it, it's absolutely game over as in what a spot from D. Maria to DePaul, 16 yards out of the angle, choked his ball into the floor. And Bapé picks it up, slides forward, helped out by Griezmann, but the desire levels from Argentina you can see they do not want to give Francis Sniff of getting back into this game. No, they must have just heard you don't know. That next goal being so important but I'd love to see Stapman Dave call some ground duels where they are on the pitch because the majority nearly all are in the France half. They're on the front foot, they're stepping forward into the opponent's half whether they've got the ball or not. It's been so aggressive with them without the ball. At the Calico International Stadium yesterday for the third place playoff there was a number of players both in Croatia and Morocco that were going down in the end with muscle injuries. Just the fatigue back at the end of what has been a really intense 29 day period. And when you think that Messi was feeling his hamstring in the semi-final he's still charging around here. No one was going to want to come off this field for the Argentinian course. Can you believe we've just had a foul throw from Rabiot World Cup final. A little bit embarrassing isn't it? What you're going to say is better than that. Yes. Here is Telya Ficke up left hand side forward looking towards McAllister. There is McAllister what a fine game he's had for Brighton and Hobalby. For Argentinian and Hobalby in the field there is Mbappe now but there is Fernandez running back tracking him every move. The last touch came off Fernandez he's on a yellow card. Words are just being said there between Romero and Mbappe. The Polish referee is quickly on hand on that. The diplomatic incident might have to be we might have to go back for a second round of talks because the French commentators decided to sit stand up once again as Griesman with the corner kick on this near side. Griesman it's an in-swinger. Good hands from Mbappe Martinez-Rov. Beautiful ball for Akipa to take into the path. Nice height. The power of everyone's head nice and clearly can set the ball away straight away. Argentina on the attack. Argentina with Messi plays the ball out towards De Paul. De Paul can't get past the sliding challenge of Teo Hernandez and it will be is it a corner or a throw over on that far side in front of the mass hordes of Argentinian support. They're not sitting down. They're standing up the cheering the jumping and waving anything that is white or sky blue. It's a throw down by the corner flag. Molina is going to take it seven minutes into the second half five live and BBC sounds here and now indeed they do get a corner kick. It's so superior. De Paul he's had a tremendous game so far he's all action isn't he. He's narrow off that right hand side. I think they're to nullify the threat of Mbappe in that first half playing off the left but Mbappe barely saw the ball. Argentina at the start of this second half or seven eight minutes in still the dominant team. Corner kick then that Messi is going to take in front of his adoring supporters in all areas of the stadium here in Lusail. He moves a little sound bike in preparation to take the corner kick far side the right wraps it in low headed out by Griezmann at that near post and Messi is ambling to take the throw. They are in no hurry and in fact he's just going to leave it for somebody else to take. They've got all the time in the world to soak up the atmosphere and soak in a score line that means they're heading for what would be a third World Cup triumph from their first since 1986. The throw is eventually taken. Alvarez tries to lay the ball back cleared away by the French defence picked up though by Otter Mending passes the ball back out towards Depaul to Mimartinez. Oh he sliced it come right out of his penalty area he's now screaming at Depaul he was midway through his own half and it was a complete miss kick but France were unable to take advantage. Up a Meccano now in the centre circle Rabiot takes over, Tua Mene lays it off to Upper Meccano and Mbappe's deep and he wants the ball to be beaten here he is. Nine minutes into the second half closed down by Messi breaks towards Tua Mene out towards that far side de l'air Teo Hernandez. That's a Tua Mene looking for the return ball cut out by Depaul. That's probably one of the first mistakes as Depaul was caught by Rabiot and the Polish referee Marciniak is going for a yellow and the French would feel that his books moment of fortune for Martinez in goal it came a long way it's just a collision in front of him that took his eye off the ball and he sliced it but when you tune him up those are the things that go for you tune him down and go against you. Here's Lucky Enzo Fernandez was loitering in the right area Fernandez to think he didn't start the first two games in this competition Scoloni put him into the team and he's playing in that sort of quarterback position as Depaul has stayed down really reckless challenge from Rabiot but want to lose him to Paul. Well he had been carrying a bit of a knock I think it was going into the the Netherlands game in the quarter finals the Atletico Madrid player but Enzo Fernandez has been linked with with Liverpool as you say started the last four games has appeared in every game at this tournament the 21 year old midfielder but has really become a a key player in that midfield for for Argentina with Depaul and McAllister and then Dymariah who's going to retire from the international stage after the world cup scored the winning goal against Brazil in the Coppa America and it's his goal that gives Argentina a cushion. A world cup incident that has never been won by winners of the Coppa America that could all change here tonight in Lusail BBC Radio 5 Live Argentina with those first half goals are tuned up Depaul is fit to continue as there was a challenge from Talia Fico on Colin Muani he's back to his feet but they're looking for a spark and at the minute that spark is not forthcoming. Well you look at Argentina you say we don't have to do anything spectacular at all we just need to sit tight and not make any mistakes because as you say they're absolutely void of any form of any form of cohesion on the ball and any form of pressure off it. It's been the French misconnection. Here is Cunde. Coming forward on this near side the right Dymariah goes to ground and slides Cunde tries to the middle of the cross closed down though by McAllister Dymariah keeps the ball in play Colin Muani now for France tries to get round the back strong challenge that was by Talia Fico there was no way that he was getting past the at the left back and France have got a throw that Cunde wants to take as we approach the hour mark here on BBC Radio 5 Live. Rabio with his bats a goal Verran being chased and hustled by Alvarez and Verran was unable to turn and had to go all the way back towards Hugo Larisse all in yellow away towards our left hand side and Bapé picks it up it was three white and sky blue strike shirts around and Bapé Messi's now gone down that was I think and Bapé Paris Saint-Germain teammate and Marcini at the referee will just want to have a word. That's the difference the urgency the Argentinian players compared to the French players he mentioned and Bapé as soon as he gets on the ball he's surrounded and it was Messi who eventually pitched the ball off him you're looking at France and how they're attacking then they're doing it as individuals they're just going I'll make a run down here he was Cunde a second ago going down the right he's just he's just running with the ball on his own there's no there's no options there to pass there's no connections between anyone Chris Sutton and Rob Green here with our five live coverage de Maria to Alvarez takes it into his stride Alvarez gets the shot away and it was a strong arm by Hugo Larisse low down to his near post didn't he do well Alvarez. Yeah darting run from right to left the angle always against him running away from goal ten yards out it's a left-footed shot Larisse down smartly Messi's on course for the golden boot he may well yet win the golden ball but Argentina are just over half an hour away of getting the golden trophy the one that matters most to him to add to his extremely long list of staggering achievements in his illustrious career and when John earlier said there was just so many records with Messi the all-time record appearance holder at World Cups with this tonight his 26th is also the first player to score in the group stage he's the round of 16 a quarter final a semi-final and a final in a single World Cup Argentina 2-0 Rob Green just looking at what France can do to change this with 15 minutes into the second half and again still not had a shot looking at the bench Kingsley Coman maybe on that there's not a lot here is de Maria twisting weaving left hand side twist one four enters the penalty area left hand side it runs through this is Messi and he's just put it right right footed it was closed down by two French defenders he's a little bit little dummy enabled it to to run through towards Messi that could have been the goal to seal it oh they're playing with such swag as such confidence de Maria down that left hand side a couple of step over twisting turning comes back out feeds the ball across to Paul let's the ball run to Messi and Rabiot does just about enough lunges puts Messi off with the shot the run heads the ball forward and will actually get a free kick he was a judge who had been fouled by Alvarez the Manchester City player the runners actually stayed down 10 yards inside his own half as they continue to trail with no real pressure on the Emi Martinez goal away towards our right hand side however when Argentina led 2-0 against Australia Australia caused a few late nerves we know what the Dutch did when they scrambled and salvaged it from 2-0 down to 2-2 in the quarterfinal France may have to resort to similar tactics well as you touched on at the start of the second half they've taken off the big man yeah and go direct ask the question of Romero and Otamendi they can't they just cannot throw a punch they cannot ask a question at the minute and there's very little to come off the bench now for France now that they've made the two attacking subs but they didn't have it they don't have an identity France but they haven't really got any fire in the belly where's the France fire Deno but at the moment it hasn't even been lit as Ravio comes forward and now it's an opportunity for Turan to Griezmann out to and to Mbappe and Mbappe left hand side with the cross headed away it's a little bit better wasn't it as the cross came in Turan and sent a forward position on his heels needs to make movement Marcus Turan his father Lillian first father and son combination to play in a World Cup final but unlike Lillian Marcus will not go to home as a World Cup winner it would seem Alvarez forward ball McCallister was getting there now Uppermakano had struck the run of McCallister and there was lens into him preventing him from getting the shot away that was it wasn't quite the same but that was a little bit like the uh the Hernandez one on Mason man wasn't it was it not as forceful a challenge from Uppermakano on McCallister another bursting run this time in a central area but it's a risk it was a risk but the fact that play is already underway means that BAR would have had a look and they quickly dismissed it 63 minutes play Argentina still lead two goals to nil Ravio Tua-Mene midway through the Argentina half diagonal ball Kunde now is set his forward takes it almost underneath his chin high up on the chest doesn't keep the ball in play no he doesn't the assistant referee eventually flags it will be a goal kick it was a risk but i guess he had to take that risk Rob well it's not enough of the contact on the back it's more on the on the ribs on the on the shoulder but i think the decided back to was the resource always going to get there first and when he did so then he answered the question for the referee Angel de Maria is leaving the stage and what a career it has been for Argentina he'll retire after the World Cup 129 appearances and 28 goals and as we said earlier a winning goal against Brazil and the copper america just his third in his 18th appearance in World Cup finals but it's his goal that gives Argentina a 2-0 lead and he's replaced by Acuna that is certainly a measure just to shore up the left hand side for for Argentina but the gamble to play de Maria Rob Green in the first place from Lidl Scoloni has certainly paid off yeah brilliant decision here is McAllister to Acuna back with that with Messi once again Messi drops his shoulder towards McAllister the return ball Messi's got to go the long way around back towards Larisse Clairsd and then Talia Fico heads it forward and then two Argentinian players closed down Cundeg goal kick to Brant that sums it up that's starting the game there Argentina linking up around the botch it doesn't work out but the rebounds the ball out they are on it they are harassing their haranguing in and around the french penalty area Brant have not been able to do that anywhere on the pitch all game Hugo Larisse to take the goal kick those Argentinian supporters behind his goal haven't stopped singing since the moment they entered this stadium a stadium where the attendance will be read out as 88,966 and they're also in a comfortable position knowing their side are almost three quarters of the way there still leading by two goals to nil tired clearance by Melina out it goes for a french throw France at the minute though just do not look like scoring grabio out to Griezmann Griezmann delivers the cross and it was a dangerous ball to from that left hand side kept in play by Colin Mouane on this near side the right Cundeg gives it away Colin Mouane wins it back challenges tell you Fico referee says he got the ball and then it's dug out by the Callister that really was a wicked ball Chris up brilliant from Griezmann out on that left hand touch line whipped the ball in left footed and Durand and Mouane on the heels didn't gamble weren't proactive the ball missed the cross and six yard watch no takers for France so really well we never know Griezmann back out towards the left hand side another dangerous cross and it's put out of play by Austin Endy for a corner kick France have that corner on the left hand side which Griezmann is going to take Argentina hasn't been too many occasions where those french trickleers have been waving tonight but they are now in comes the corner and it goes out of play for a gold kick we're midway through the second half don't go anywhere just to save the atmosphere even if there are no more goals it's Argentina 2, Frans Niel live on five life and here's that correspondent John Murray. Thanks Ian we might hear from you again if there's extra time but I doubt it and France are going to make another double change if you weren't listening earlier did he a day shop so serious was the situation for his team he made a double change in the 41st minute and now he's going to bring on Jung Kammervinger the Real Madrid midfielder or left back as he's been for France here and also Kingsley Coleman is coming on as Chris suggested he might do although Coleman has been one of the players who was named as struggling with this virus that's been in the french squad this week so it is Argentina 2, Frans Niel and we have less than a quarter of this world cup final here in Qatar to go and here is Messi playing it back into his own half and the two frenchmen are limbering up on the halfway line I noticed as well that the referee has actually told the Argentine substitute to are on the bench to calm down good luck with that France win a free kick 10 yards inside the the Argentine half they were going to make a change there but they're taking a quick free kick everything is so urgent now for France. Teo Hernandez with a cross on the left hand side but cleared away by Romero unflappable clearance from the top defender and Alvarez is dispossessed on the halfway line France have improved in the second half but but they have to and now Turan down the line Marcus Turan into the full back position Molina puts in the challenge in comes support as well from to Paul and the ball's caught up as he goes to ground and Teo Hernandez was in there but Argentina have come out with it and to Paul raises forward but the the defender is there to play it all the way back to goalkeeper Loris this is five live we have Rob Green and Chris Sutton with us here in the commentary position in the stadium Rob yeah just Argentina levels have dropped and it's understandable they've been going 70 minutes now and everything on the line and eventually France have managed to string some passes together get some bodies forward and get them together in numbers reasonable to try and define spaces that he was so quiet in the first half but Argentina were just dominant and they lead through those two first half goals the messy penalty and the goal the counterattack from Di Maria France could still be interesting but Mbappe does so well and shoots right footed from just inside the box a dancing run from Mbappe we've seen so little of that that the shot was high over the top of the crossbar Chris Sutton yeah Larm Bells Argentina the first time Mbappe off that left hand side moved out there in this second half drove on the inside but on that devastating right foot of his but just off balance and scooped his shot 18 yards over the bar and that's it the Griezmann Griezmann's been substituted so it's Geru and Dan Bally off in the first half Griezmann off in the second and Theo Hernandez also makes way so Camel Vinga has gone across to play it left back again he is not left back he is an excellent sensory fielder a real prospect but for a man who's had such a fantastic tournament it's been such a difficult performance tonight starved of any form of ball any form of support for Griezmann Argentina coming forward so Corman and Camel Vinga along as a second four years time when we're watching the World Cup all being well that Camel Vinga will be operating in the middle of the French midfield he has Messi on the left hand side Messi little steps still going turns away from Kunde gives it back Fernandez right foot shot the too close to Laurie's who was able to quickly step to his left and pat the ball then yes sorry I was in the stadium he scored an absolute snonker against Mexico bent it into the far top corner from a more central position there but maybe just got them all stuck under his right foot a little bit trying to aim for that far corner but ended up just clipping it straight at Laurie's who was central so what are France doing now then with those changes Corman is on the right Rob and then Touran has taken up a forward position to the right of Mbappe and then Colomouane he's gone over to the left hand side basically four to four as many players forward as you can and hope if something comes off because that's all that's been so far is just hope well at 2-0 and it's been so comfortable for Argentina and and they've threatened quite regularly to get a third goal in the second half but it is still 2-0 and we've got just over 15 minutes to play France get a goal well Martinez hasn't got shirt dirty yet he hasn't had to make the save in any form so I'll make two notes Rob for for France the header that Giroud put over early on in the match which was actually given as a foul against him which I didn't think was the right decision and then that Mbappe running from the left and the shot over the top that's it France with up on the car now carries the ball for it takes it on but then in steps Romero in Argentina as France tried to press forward and he's been fouled actually Romero as the challenge came in and from Colomouane I think it is and it's a free kick to Argentina and sensing Argentina the fact that France are setting themselves for a bit of an offensive here Argentina very clever here just to break things up slow things down and slow the game down no rush see it through I was toppling up John because I'm a little bit of a banana rack at times and I've been lonely this week with that Ali Bruce ball topping up shots on the Argentinian goal in this tournament only eight shots on their goal Martinez has been well protected there was just that period wasn't there in the in the game against the Netherlands where the Netherlands made a brutal brand of football went very direct put the young on and they're course on where they really struggled defensively rather than that Martinez has been protected superbly free kick Martinez to take this downfield five live from the BBC Argentina to France nil France come back with it and here is a mbappe down the left hand side trying to trying to use that pace that we know so well but across comes Romero and just takes the ball off his toe and Argentina can bring the ball forward with the ball and now he has one for alvarez to chase and alvarez is on to this defender is there with him up on mccano he's forced him out into the fullback position I thought for a moment there he was going to be past him but open mccano did well actually and recovered and was able to to snuff out that danger yeah really good defending in the end but alvarez was on his own so even if he had got there first and got clear there's a tight angle and very very difficult to make something of it from there as France passes the ball out of play and french heads go down again by the way if you aren't like chris missing alley you'll be able to hear him again very soon because with this world cup this christmas world cup in the middle of the season if you've been listening to us through the world cup and have come back to us perhaps or listen to us for the first time this is what we do all the time this sort of thing so we will have Premier League commentaries coming your way more than anyone the epa cup third round in the new year the champions league in february and march it's all covered here and tuesday wednesday and thursday caribou cup fourth round commentary so that's the day after tomorrow mk dons against leicester and actually i know it is bright enough playing charlton on wednesday do you think alexis mccallister is going to be involved in that one no better time to play than off a high of winning the world cup as as you footballers always tell us football footballers like to play here argentina playing it forward towards messi messi flicks it on towards depaul depaul now on the right hand side that incomes the challenge there's an effect from microphone over there and depaul goes down blood kirling cry camo venga put in the challenge and the free kick goes argentina's way wouldn't we are spotting down there rob on this in the s i kinks coman struggling limping around had a discussion with the management team of france and he's pretty much their last attacking threat that they've had to bring on off the bench he's actually got a he's got a flick of alvarez's boot on his knee and he's he's leaning over he's struggling with it friends have already made one two three four substitutions two nil argentina lead that world cup is getting closer depaul despite the blood kirling cries okay he's back on his feet and now uh it's played by finandez to messi on the right hand side now did the ball inside the box goes past up a mccano but the cross loaded the near post is swallowed up by the man in yellow the top them goalkeeper the french captain who it would seem is not going to captain two consecutive world cup winning teams google lorries here's mccallister not thinking about charlton finandez plays it out to the right hand side and argentina have it back inside their own heart it's steered by finandez out to the right hand side and the noise from these argentina supporters is incessant this stood all the way i mean there there are argentina fans all around the stadium must say by the way in some of the expensive seats on the far side i'm not sure people have actually come back since half time it's a lot more full than it was now but for the world cup final you know not to occupy your seats is a simple really but argentina with the ball on the right camo vinga plays it up towards him bhabi who clicks it forward but otamendi is going to get there actually no he's not he's been beaten to it but otamendi puts in the challenge and it's a penalty all quit defending from otamendi and friends have taken advantage colo moani forced his way into the box felt the contact went down and referee martini at points to the penalty spot penalty france lifeline france i've got to say i think it's a soft penalty but otamendi just hesitates allows the ball to bounce no oney too strong too quick too powerful gets the other side of him there's minimal contact no oney goes down and from nowhere really just looking at the french body language a few moments ago they didn't believe but what an opportunity this is for france we're in the 79th minute two nil to argentina the killian and bapet this is the first penalty france have had at this world cup and it's killian and bapet are taking a run up from just to the left behind the ball it becomes right footed and he scores martini's went the right way martini's the brilliant penalty saver a huge leap from him but and bapet's penalty was too good it's found the bottom corner and france have a chance it's argentina to france won and like meshi and bapet scores from the penalty spot in the final and they both had six goals at this world cup yeah it's a terrific penalty martini's gets fingertips to it goes the right way but the power and the accuracy on the penalty was enough and france do have a lifeline france have some hope really from absolutely nowhere martini's unlucky there ron well if you do that slow pause step run up then the chances are you're going to go to the goalkeepers right if you're right footed because you've got to gain the power in it for mbappe he got enough power in it and it was a really good penalty macron was up the france fans are up and for the first time the argentina fans the tens of thousands of them sat down well this is this is the classic situation isn't it world cup final but we've been down this road in football matches you know listeners will have been down this road a comfortable lead a two near lead you've been much the better team and then in the latter stages the opponents get one what will happen next and now and bapet has the chance to score which he does brilliant finish from the angle right footed across martini's who's going to add to it but couldn't give it out it's found the bottom corner and it's a bapet to the rescue from france it's two two from nowhere where has this come from and bapet has barely had a kick and it was messy who was robbed of the ball i think from coman they worked the ball into a central position and then i think it's a i think it's a bit of a give and go the ball's fed to rabeo opens his body up feeds it to him bapet you heads the ball down i think it's to to ram who then lifts the ball over to him bapet's a brilliant finish on the volley body shape superb from the bapet and he hammers a right foot a right footed shot into the far corner past martini's nobody saw this coming it's a wonder goal it's a wonder goal from him bapet and it's brought the game to life the last two minutes but brought these games alive they were cruising every single little one of france subs has to be booked because they all sprinted across the pitch to celebrate with him bapet well referee martiniak ticked off the argentina bench he can't go and book all of the french substitutes they've all they're all gathering themselves didier daschamps reaction was incredible well what a world cup finals this has turned out to be two two an extra time decking and what did we say about argentina against the netherlands but we couldn't see it happening in this game but it just has we said do something different and there was nothing different about it but the softest of soft penalties and all of a sudden the dynamic change the belief changed in both things within 90 seconds i saw between the two goals the ambapé penalty and then his seventh at this world cup ambapé now leads the standings and kelly and ambapé have certainly stepped into this world cup and here's a kudnia on the left hand side for argentina and finanda shoots and that's blocked by upa mccano on the edge of the box and it looks like argentina if they're going to win it if they're going to take this world cup back to brenner sary's they're going to have to win this world cup final all over again and actually now the holders have got their tails up all the changes that didier daschamps made i mean it improved france but we did not see that coming well they're all over the place now tactically the shape's completely gone they've thrown everything to the win but and bapé's tail is up he's on a hat trick but at the moment the ball is being carried forward through the middle and it's given out to ambapé on the left hand side who crosses to the back post but it's just all to the top of paula and wani and behind for a gulkin to argentina what an incredible incredible match this is how france are back in this i really don't know you think about the the automand hesitation though to allow the ball to baron smuani to get the other side and then mesi who's been brilliant all evening hasn't he giving the ball away it's robbed of the ball but it's moments isn't it it's been a world cup of moments magic moments and ambapé's finish was absolutely stunning france win a free kick inside their own half it looked as though france were meekly heading to defeat we were talking about the virus that's bothered them all week didier daschamps made his changes and it looks as though didier daschamps changes might just have come up trumps chris yeah the last time i saw didier daschamps as excited as that job was when he turned over the king of hearts in a westland and hotel room there you go and you couldn't believe you look and you said didier you're better than that argentina to france too and he raised an eyebrow and he took the spoils and he might just he might just do it again he may have been thinking of me in that moment maybe he was chris well kunde now on the right hand side and it's ale la blaire inside the le sale stadium here and that's a foul by mccalista suddenly argentina are on the back foot france winner free kick there's no greasement on the field now though in terms of the set pieces there's two balls on the pitch and no was noticed that's um while this game is at the moment it's all instinctive from france they're just doing it on the hoop and just going for it and it's coming off he's all of a sudden a threat from everywhere well when they did win that world cup last time it was three two free kick is taken by france kunde and then bat eight the gatherer bounces to the edge of the argentina bot then headed forward by colo moane oh that could be a penalty no it's giving us a free kick the other way it's giving us a free kick to argentina and a yellow card is shown to rabbi oh well i mean the referee marchin that was was waving that card around it might have been to ram yeah to ram it was who i guess has been yellow carded but throwing himself down yep well the referee seemed pretty sure let's have a look yeah i think he's on his way down there to ram is he caught no he's better than that trace six oh six tonight oh yeah you don't need to worry about the simulation game there marcus two rams got that wrapped up oh i tell you what the water moment i think we initially thought he was caught but watching it back good decision from the referee the referee held his nerve well done referee marchin yeah very good decision very good spot the first tollish man to referee a world cup final and he's uh he's got a big tick in the book for that one and then there's been a clash of heads now on the far time far side that's a a stoppage in play and we will have the significant amount of time added on at the end of this match which almost goes without saying at this world cup it was raviol and alvarez who have come together so we'll have a stoppage now but what a what a 15 minutes that was it's incredible couple of moments and just feel these as christ touched on the first penalty the demaria penalty it was so soft that it kind of set marchin here the referee up to have to give that one because there was contact because he was the wrong side we're talking to premier league about a higher bar being in the penalty area it's not the case for either of those but there's no arguing about that second and bat a goal wow kelly and on bat payers very much come to the party and here he is walking across now and he's telling the french families actually behind the dugout to raise themselves and and give it give it some noise against all of these argentines and those two goals that he scored and bat is there's seven goals at this world cup but that for him now that's 11 goals at world cup so he's become the youngest to score 10 goals or more in world cup tournaments and he's also become the youngest man to score in two world cup finals scored in moscow in the four two win against creuisha four years ago and two goals in this world cup final and that was his two goals in kazan in the cooking pot which did for argentina at the last world cup so raviol just looking at him bat pay there what's going on there there's a little bit of something going on with uh remearo and finandes but that's calm down for the time being oh that's a that's a bit of a challenge by remearo isn't it on turan on the edge of the box and that's a free kick that is a free kick to france two or three paces outside the penalty out but he was awarded a free kick but he's not he's changed his mind throwing is taken full comes into the argentina penalty area and that's headed away by otamendi comes back for france and bat pay swings it high across the penalty area colman while he was limping he looked as though he might not be able to continue that's when it was two nil but things have changed since then and colman continues and we've got eight minutes of added time so could the extra time in the world cup final two two argentina would two nil up with ten minutes to play and france and bat pay have changed all that and colman now inland the challenge with mccallister roll bounces away up on mccarno forward a flick through the middle and bat pay gives it back to turan but and bat pay had come back from an offside position and it is a free kick to argentina for every ball into the argentina box now your heart's in your mouth you just think they're at sixes and sevens it just the game slowed down but the jeopardy is a knife edge now i don't know what jonah don't know what jammy in french is but they've been so ugly in this game haven't they and all of a sudden they look like the more likely team to go on and win this argentina with it on the left hand side akunya through for alvarez but he can't reach that it's all the hit and it was through for agul kick i think it might be vinaal if i remember rightly from my lessons at school jammy looking in french trevina you are vinaal that george is alongside you with his phone and google how dare you what an accusation goal kick loris takes this downfield and the substitutes i mean turan columani of course real problems and that's what they're doing again in argentina aradama argentina are worried here that this could turn completely around against them how by remeiro well two up top straight ball willing the first header argentinians couldn't cope against the netherlands who stopped doing an extra time what they were effective at but and the french nick one well it is a free kick and bap is going across that ticket so no greasement on the pitch anymore so and bap is taking up this role so he's setting himself it's way out on the left hand side we are in added time we're in the third minute of added time it's two two and bap in the golden boots plays it in but it's headed away on the edge of the area for argentina and then alvarez with a touch and forward from akunya and fiery deflection that's out of play and dda dechon with that little piece of control in his shiny black shoes demonstrates that he was a little more than a water carrier and it's a throw in to argentina inside their own heart it's going to be a very interesting discussion with mark chaplain and kelly kates once the added time is up as to who would be the favorites going into extra time with the way that france have come back and uh france argentina wanted a free kick for a challenge on the court but and bap is off and he shoots and he gets underneath that it took an affliction as well which carried it higher and wider and behind in its corner and now he's playing a different game to everybody else on the field just that little burst over a couple of yards gets him away from finandez opens up but it's also mendy who gets out deflects the shot over the bar and the way that killion and bap has come to life in this world cup final argentina are sitting uneasily here's the corner martinez comes and gets a punch the argentine goalkeeper chumani takes that down camo vinga now back out to the left hand side from where the corner came and uh koman goes around the outside he's still going and he's up ended just outside the box play continues camo vinga with the shot and then it's saved by martinez camo vinga cut it back rabio hit the shot but it was close enough to martinez to go down and even though he parried it and lost it he was able to gather it at the second attempt when it bounced off the defender yeah i could say big save very difficult through bodies bodies in and around in that it's the first save he's made in the game such is the way the shape that it's got up argentina come forward winner throw in halfway inside the french half all sorts of carry on an activity going down on the french bench all the substitutes are on that feet and actually referee martini has got his card out and he's running over here to this side of the field and uh he is saying that someone on the french bench i want you to come forward now and he shows him the yellow card it's jiru it's Olivier jiru who was called forward was taking back the school days rob there that was very much you you you you come here i was made him walk to the edge of the pitch showed him the yellow card i was always at the front of the class anyway didn't need to walk anywhere argentina to france to deep in added time a goal now and whoever scores it will win the world cup and now it is france coming forward and um bapme plays it through the middle and in comes the challenge on colum wanny and advances back to him bapme in the box on the left hand side ball rattling around they can't get it clear colum wanny goes down in the area and the referee says no penalty no penalty but last ditch last ditch heart in mouth defending from argentina there chris oh it was it somehow scrambled the ball to safety it looked like on a couple of occasions bwanny was going to break through he is messy at the other end though middle of a half still two minutes close to play akunya out to the left hand side the ball played in from the left flank from what a mendee of all people blocked inside the area then rabios and that was a desperate foul because argentina thought that france could be aware and chalia fico is quite fortunate not to be yellow carded for that oh all the shape has gone from this game and it feels completely gone it's just being bypassed which is great from our point of view suits and bapme down to the ground he is just saving himself waiting for those bursts those moments of energy those moments of just instinctive play between him and his teammates ball headed in field for france but cleared away by otter mendee argentina coming forward now argentina dominated the game for 80 minutes really akunya he has alvarez on the left hand side the manchester city youngster to depot and now square to messy and messy on the edge of the d leford shot saved by loris leaping to his right what a moment that was and it was kept out by the flying french captain it's a corner and that was the moment i think once messy drops inside two french defenders and gets the ball onto his left foot you're thinking goal what a save from loris romp flying to his right hand side big left hand he's just had a little bit of deeper last minute moment movement to his left hand side it's caught the left wrist as it's gone over the bar but everyone was up commentators are out crowd are off loris was up as well what a world cup final this is turning out to be how dramatic how unexpectedly dramatic it's two two we're heading into extra time but argentina have a corner messy plays it in it's headed away in the opposed and now colman is fouled colman is fouled as he was bringing it forward that has to be a yellow card it is for akunya and that was blatant from him and uh france have a free kick but they would have been away they was 3v3 with him batting away and no one was catching him that is the best foul of this world cup two two five live from the bbc all those argentina fans are sitting rather uncomfortably as the spectator first is sitting quite uncomfortably as well the only man who have scored a hat trick in a world cup final here's colman down the right hand side colman's away from the callister colman with the cross it takes a double bounce of argentina players inside their own penalty area but bounces out of the box and messy now takes it up inside his own half deep inside his own half finds a brilliant pass forward to alvarez down the left wing trench defenders getting back alvarez into the box now and then flicks it back to the edge of the area to messy and messy with camovinga is able to hook it across to paul with the head earth and that's not it away on the edge of the pot and that's it that is it the 90 minutes plus are up and we will have extra time here at the end of this world cup final in catta after a two two draw argentina two france two a match that france had to transform and did chris sultan amazing amazing second half france just were not in it and then all of a sudden muhane breaks beyond otamendi they win the penalty and bapé has the balls pops it in and then moments later gets a wonderful wonderful second goal nobody saw that coming two two extra time you're sort of fancy france an extra time don't you i have no idea what to make of this next half an hour because that made no sense whatsoever and then from there well that's why we've got you here rob oh look look who's look who's suddenly arrived very quickly at the end of full time hello jules you arrived a much quicker at full time than at half time didn't you i found the way much easier this time and and i met myself at kelly dis where was killing em bapé for 80 minutes unbelievable i don't know no shots at all until the 70th minute and then those two goals back to back the penalty first and then the second goal is a thing of beauty the whole big the one two with torami i lost my voice because because i shot it so much on a second goal but i just don't know when they find where they found the the resources to come and and go at them again the changes worked in a way i thought i thought command is doing really well to ram as well um and this came out of nowhere literally nowhere i mean i think it's fair to say the virus has run its course through this team but when you look at what france did after 80 minutes you're right to point out the effect because it was commonly won the ball off off messy to start the move for the goal wasn't it but you can't put that down to any kind of tactical brilliance that was just a couple of minutes of absolute chaos and then the game was descended into an uncontrolled i wouldn't say mess because it's been brilliant to watch but it has been uncontrolled yeah that's right but if you if you remember the argentina game against australia they lost control a bit the last 20 minutes against the dutch they lost control as well maybe physically they're a bit tired because they were so good for the first hour and i think the the substitution from deshawn that's all he could do that's the only players really can bring on so are you saying france played for the chaos at the end of the game that they knew was going to come from argentina and actually this is all pre-planned genius exactly we just wait i'm i'm i can't take it anymore i don't know what's going to happen the next half an hour there it's going to be incredible well it'll be interesting won't it because they they left themselves open at the back as well and argentina had chances towards the end so if they continue extra time like they finished the last 10 minutes of normal time both sides we're going to have plenty more chances yeah you're right i mean let's not forget that eduardo camavinga is 19 this is the second game of his life i left back and he's the world cup final and he's gone messy in front of him and i mean i don't know what camavinga is going to do for the next half hour but this this is probably the most important half hour in his whole life to play completely out of position against the greatest player of all time but this is why he's down too now those 11 players on the pitch will have to to find a way of trying to win this gordon you don't retake your seat as messi and lorice do the coin toss for ends and kickoff for extra time chris myself and kelly would would when the referee didn't play advantage right at the end we said kelly said to me that's the first mistake he's made and he has he's had considering the pressure in our own analysis we are yeah let's not bring guests in no and we thought we analyzed not very well yeah who needs commentators and summarizers when we have you to uh that was though it was a it was a prep that's when france when this game has opened up that's when france look at their most dangerous you know they have that pace now and that power uh and and that guile up top but that was the first mistake what was that 87 88 minutes that's quite good isn't it so they toss the coin to the south go on i was going to say they've tossed the coin to decide which end they're going to play at the commentators have tossed the coin to decide who's going to start this period of extra time it is with chris sotman roggreen you just got a sneak peek of him there ian denis thank you kelly you know when john said earlier we were talking about what's jammy in french what's plummets in french because i honestly didn't think i'd be coming back on and when john said i'd have all his voice again well there you go because i don't think anybody anybody could see france coming back in to this world cup final and yet they have a bolt from the blues as we're underway and it's france in all navy blue during this first period of extra time on bbc radio five live are playing from right to left and the momentum towards the end was certainly with the french in those two stunning goals particularly the second one complete turnaround so two two and also argentina have made a change at the start of extra time montiel has come on fort malina it's a like for like change the severe right back he was suspended for the semifinal against croatia and it's only his fourth appearance started against mexico he's made a couple of appearances off the bench so he's on so emi martinez is in goal montiel romeiro otomendi and talia fico mcallister finandez de paul and akunya mesi and alvarez argentina in their white and sky blue strike shirts and white shorts are playing from left to right and we have the french side with jugo loriz in goal kundey upper mccano verand and camo vinga coman choua many raviol and bapé to ram and cola mouane here is montiel for argentina vouched over by to ram free kick to argentina that's a growing concern for the fourth official and i would imagine it during the extra time that the the substitutes and the coaching staff if you've ever been on a Sunday park football the children on the morning and you see the over zealous parent who's just straying over the touch line and putting pressure on the officials that type of behavior has certainly been here in abundance tonight with both sets really of the bench where at times they've gone over that and encroached onto the pitch and the officials will be looking to try and cut that out here is finandez in the midfield for for argentina as it goes towards akunya wraps over the cross alvarez was making a run comes out towards mccallister who drills it off charging and so we press the reset button there's a good ball in whipped in from that left hand side from akunya haven't been so effective argentina since demaria went off but verana taking up that position in the near post space area got a good enough connection for effort i think from mccallister dragged this shot well wide it's the eighth world cup final that has gone to extra time only two have been decided by penalties 94 and 2006 mr paul charges forward for argentina little slip by camo vinga allows mesi who then holds back camo vinga there was no attempt to play the ball there but you see yellow for that any other player other than mesi you're thinking is the yellow card absolutely yep clear as day but sense to get away with little things camo vinga who started as a right back against genisia playing as a as a left back here for for france has already three minutes into this first period of extra time two and many midway through his own half bbc radio five live and bbc sounds and if you've been listening to us on the the radio you've been out and about on a sunday afternoon and you're about to close to home it's on bbc one and you can listen to world cup extra on the i player through to listen to our commentary as well as watch the pictures and we've already had so much drama you wait to see what else will unfold here in the lucel stadium two and many plays it short camo vinga over the halfway line france being direct aren't they the ball lorice just clip forward moani winning the header here is raviol looking to try and get the ball through the middle to color moani cleared by remearo i mean that's where the dutch didn't learn their lessons as color moani has won it back there's a strong 50 50 ball dug out by finandez after battling back with that dramatic finish from bout beghorst they then went back into their shell a little bit didn't and it didn't continue to play as direct that had caused argentina all of the problems why are you thinking at the start of the game you're saying if it's a chaotic game it would suit argentina more this now if it's chaotic it suits france with the players they've got on the pitch pre-kicked in france and it's going to have to be retaken there's going to be a change in fact down below so this is the fifth substitute but they are still allowed one more they'll get an extra one in extra time will will france and it's raviol who's who's coming off and raviol who was one of those players who's been fighting that that virus is so well to last as long as he has really so raviol is off and usef fafana of monaco comes on to replace him in the in the midfield it was fafana who in fact is deputized and started in that semi-final against against morocco and in fact suspected concussion is the reason that raviol has gone off hey you took that blow towards the end of the second half then he on the back of the neck side of the head spent some time getting treatment so fafana here now in the midfield in the centre circle back to upper mccano come of ingor at left back ball played up towards and bapé on a hat trick looking to turn he's only scored one hat trick in his french career as you you think 35 goals he's now scored in 66 appearances romeiro is just getting a talking to from marcinniak and bapé has actually stayed down now holding his his ankle i thought it was his hamstring initially his hands have moved further down as a strong challenge from romeiro so does that substitution has just been a concussion subject can they have another one yes they can six and a half minutes played in this first period of extra time two two remarkable turnaround you know somebody who doesn't like football then just show them this game because it just never ever ceases to amaze macalester out towards that far side a cunha on the left with the cross drops just away from messy pops back up towards messy lifted back in by de paul and out it goes for a a gold kick and now all of a sudden you can't call it yet for no 80 minutes you'd say argentina all day long yeah it's one ball into the box it's one tired run that needs to be made one just gamble just get in there there they didn't it's a little bit slow just a little bit labored and you've just got to take that chance at some point it's your chance to be a hero could we be heading to a penalty shootout here in lusail luris goes long with the goal kick headed away by osimendi challenge comes in from cune on a cunha cross was an awkward one to deal with there for remeira but stooping he saw it back to emi martinez he might have to produce the heroics just as he did against the dutch in the quarterfinal here inside this stadium as we're midway through the first period of extra time here on bbc radio five live argentina to france to finandez to montiel montiel back with the finandez just think as the ball is colomouane lifts it back on the inside of montiel colomouane to the area goes into the box quickly surrounded by the sky blue and white striped shirts and stopped just at the right time to paul place it down the yet the line camo vinga fransto have been re-energized with the substitutions that they've made here is mbappe nice little footwork dances away from the challenge of remeiro who sets off in pursuit of mbappe and mbappe's into the penalty box there and in the end it was so very tired defending managed to get the ball away argentina just needs to kick the ball off because the paul can barely move goes to ground under the challenge that was kofana and he's got a free kick for his efforts as well they look the stronger the fessier side they do wasn't that a brilliant little run from mbappe twinkle toes initially and eventually argentinian bodies back to win the ball back but this is an opportunity no free kick on this left-hand side colomouane over the ball right footed in swinger i think the french have the height on the argentinians all in navy playing from right to left first period of extra time come to take it into a crowded area headed out by finandez fired back in by fafana strikes the back of finandez and then a leaping messy has to concede the corner kick rob brink it's all france now swamp the box are doing really well with positional shape just three on the edge just not allowing argentina out argentina deep breath need to see these moments through corner kick to france colomouane to take it again on this near side the left and it goes headed out at the at the near post comes out to fafana left footed passes to kunde first hand cross comes in eight yards out further ahead of away by kounia towards messy challenged by tue manik and the referee has given a free kick to argentina for a very late flag i think initially had given the foul although ordered the free kick for a foul on messy for fafana but i'm not sure about that once i gave the the offside instead argentina who've got still a number of players to bring on they've only made two changes so far akunia and montiel so they're going to bring on latara martinez and also parade s is going to be coming on in the midfield but it's colomouane who was challenged there by montiel referee says no foul but then the worst one on mccalister and mccalister not happy so here we're going to see a couple of changes latara martinez who's going to be coming off the default is going to be coming off parade s will replace default so that will be in the in the midfield he's had a fine game fine tournament indeed rodrigo de paul latara martinez avinta malan who scored the decisive penalty against the dutch comes on for alvarez who's worked himself into the ground both de paul and alvarez barely moved by the end of the time on the pitch martinez has the engine and though not long to show it it's certainly one who can get around still at 2-2 here in le sale we'll give you all of the reaction all of the fallout from this dramatic world cup final on the world cup daily part available on bbc sounds very soon it will revert to the five live football daily no doubt previews for the league cup ties that will be bringing you on tuesday wednesday and thursday on bbc radio five live but in this gripping world cup final who will come out on top as we approach the end of this first period of extra time remeiro searching ball out towards the left headed away by kunday brought down by bacalas the brighton player signed by sanjul for eight million pounds he's certainly going to be a real gem for brighton and they'll certainly triple that amount of money one would imagine for their new acting head of recruitment at the amex with 90 seconds remaining as the ball is played forward to akuny and akuny on the edge of the area akuny tries to get the shot away left but it couldn't keep it down goes out of play for a goal kick still 2-2 that was a sensational pass from karedes near the halfway line business in a pass through akuny had positioned himself in the corner of the 18 yard box and the ball rebounded back to the initial effort it's a poor effort wasn't it the ball goes out of the plate for a french goal kick they look like they've gone to three at the back now with montiel as the as the wing back with the less ambitious for that set piece where paredes had just dropped back inside the two central defenders he certainly doesn't venture far the hole in midfielder at the best of times anyway inside the last 60 seconds messi and mccallister try and combine messi comes away back towards mccallister the return ball to messy he's found lakana martinez shot blocked comes out to montiel and then off the head of viran and behind for a corner kick what a game this has been 2-2 well what a block that's as good as a goal that from upa mccano they work it superbly argentina messi pops the ball out to martinez and everybody's thinking he must score upa mccano from nowhere gets the block on then the boy don't even know who shot that from the edge of the box is hammered montiel and headed behind he came off the head of viran by my watch the 15 minutes this first period of extra time are up one minute of additional time which we're now into argentina corner kick far side to left it's deep it's high and it's going to curl all the way out of the penalty area and shoo and many and finandez go shoulder to shoulder and it will be a fan french throw on this near side caught that well didn't he montiel look like a kung fu style kick the absolutely caught it flush hasn't ever scored for argentina what a chance that would have been to get his first as the ball is lifted forward lakana martinez goes goal with stabs it wide it was upa mccano who went with him they're appealing for a corner kick but machinac is saying no it's a brilliant tackle right at the death camo vingo was playing him on side last throw of the leg as martinez is about to shoot just enough on it chance for another breather after the end of 90 minutes rob cream just slumps into his chair at the end of the 90 minutes but we've got another 15 minutes of extra time here and it's argentina to trans to mark what you're pointing at christ oh wow did you lost his head there with is it to ram i think it is to ram yeah just scream i don't know whether the drama screaming the sharp was screaming at him for about 20 seconds there he was and and and they're still they're still next to each other and maybe he's just calmed down slightly and didier deshaux just maybe opened the hand up towards to ram and didier deshaux has gathered his french players in the circle and he is in the middle now as he talks to them what what a block from upa mccano christ and in fact he got the tackle on as well on on latara martinez when it went for a corner and they gave a goal kick but upa mccano's tackle was phenomenal yeah as the ball goes to martinez he's what eight yards out at an angle with just lorris to beat and everybody inside the stadium thinking goal all of a suddenly launches himself upa mccano gets the block and then the issue with camo vinga playing at left back of course didn't hold a good line he was deeper than uh than upa mccano martinez really good run but upa mccano got across you know crucial defending and it's been argentina who were looking more likely to win this game now argentina may have had the better chances rob but france looked like they have more energy and argentina now look like france did for the first 80 minutes again something like that yeah uh it's uh i just think they again they just go direct you know it's been working and it works for the netherlands and when they do and baffet comes alive and the jeopardy all of a sudden no one knows who's got the ball away it's gonna land but the jeopardy's there and the whole tension in the stadium rises just think now with argentina attacking that huge bank of fans that'll that may give them a little lift as they're going into this second period this is sensational and completely unforeseen on 79 minutes john morray the second period of extra time begins argentina kickoff in the sky blue and white stripes they're playing from right to left as we look from high up here on the dugout side of the lucel stadium this great golden casket of the ball and it is argentina with a kounja down the left and the ball is blocked away off colman but argentina keep it in play and mccalister plays it square and the newly arrived paredes out to messi on the right hand side and here's the cross deep from montiel but that's got too much on it which just drifts away over the goal and beyond the far poster behind for a goal kick rob gate and green and chris sunday are with us here witnessing this unforgettable f8 unforgettable world cup final that i don't know about you two but i would like to see this won before penalties it's been such a good game i'd just like to see it won in the conventional style i think you'd want someone to go for it in this next 15 minutes to give it a real go and just to throw caution to the wind i get the feeling there's a minute tick by that might not happen no i'm thinking that also but why don't we want a bit more drama john i'd like i'd like genuine drama i'd like a proper goal scored to win a match like this ball played over the top loris has come out of his goal and and montiel was chasing away down there from the full back position and loris shoved it away out for a throwing on the right hand side montiel has gone quickly across to take base those argentina fans behind the goal not as animated as they were for the first 80 minutes of the match not by any means throwing into the penalty area mesley shoots low and loris has to go down and push it away and the ball's still in play and up on mccano puts in the challenge one or two behind the goal shout rather hopefully that that might have been a penalty in fact they've got a corner out of it off of a mccano i think he's given an offside some i don't actually know what's going on there but he's given us lorris taking the gold kick maybe it wasn't offside but what's all good goalkeeping rob wasn't it from lorris and i was about to say it was an awkward shot actually chris that was well said amazing everything isn't it beauty is in the high of the holder it is a gold kick that loris will take two to the score if you've just joined us you joined us late on five live or on the bbc world service across africa wherever you are just imagining what it might be like in blenis aries right now ball played forward through the middle out our martin is lasing off mesley then finandez back to the right side side he's out oh mesley's there it's cleared off the line or is it over is it over mesley in the six yard box mesley's celebrating he's celebrating and the goal is given mesley has scored it an argentina lead by three goals to two he was there in the six yard box when it mattered it was blocked on the line but it was over the line and now mesley just like a baby has scored two goals in this final this unforgettable world cup final here in catar and argentina are back in front again three two on france yeah it's uh it's just a hopeful ball initially martinez makes the run in behind and then the ball's fed out wide martinez hammers a shot it's a brilliant save from laryce instinctive save but his near post but he just palms the ball down and mesley i think it's right footed from mesley gets the ball over the line bundles it over the line and mesley has he had the final the celebrations are still going on they're still going on and mesley now emerges from that and this is at the end where the mass ranks of the argentina fans are and mesley punches the air over and over again and now on his own he breaks away two clenched fists in the air little mesley what a moment and he stands now and he turns and he raises his arms and he says to those argentina fans come on up go the arms again and may respond what a moment what theater they celebrated with all four corners of the ground and it's by inches it goes in by inches verand staggering back over the line cannot do enough to stop it going over the line and everyone from the bench everyone behind the goal was up and credit to argentina as well you know moment like that they had three men in blue and white shirts inside the french penalty area finandes and lautaro martinez and then ultimately mesley in the six yard box i'm not sure what sort of contact he actually got on it but it was enough to get it on target and over the line before for anglia did away three to argentina lead just like it was when they last won the world cup in 1986 that finished three two to diegel maradona's argentina and is it fair to say john and rob that wasn't a goal you'd necessarily associate with leanal messey two yards out was it a christian goal was by the way it was he was off his foot not his chin he was offside in the build up but it was did go to him and that was just a bit of fortune they needed so messey now moves back alongside umbatte on seven goals at this world cup france aren't finished yet though and he has two ram on the left hand side nice footwork from him but it's smacked the way downfield by argentina verand with a header across to obama carnaugh who knotted back to loris and again the holders now are facing defeat they are well they're 10 minutes from losing this world cup final but they've been there before ball through the middle for umbatte he can't get there huge cheer because parades did for argentina the ball bounces to akunye here akunye just gets to it before it rolls over the white line la tarah martinez is chasing this verand is watching the ball down into the full back position and he's stumbled as he passed the ball out of play i think he's suggesting that he got a shove but la tarah martinez didn't seem to be close enough to him no he's just absolutely shattered completely broken physically chasing that ball and remember verand was one of the players who affected by the illness this week and uh he's on his knees and i don't think he's going to be able to continue one of the john one of the argentinian substitutes picked the ball up and volleyed it i think it nearly went into the top tier there brand's leaving brand's leaving the action he's been he's been led away up the touch line cana cana cana has come on to replace him so that was done double quick by uh by giggy a deshaun so ibrahim akunate of leberpool is is on the field in the world cup final where argentina lead france by three goals to two and now time is running out again for france akunja has got the ball next to the corner flag akunja putting his foot on it he's been leaned into by uh colman who wasn't able to get the ball away so akunja's got it back and eventually it does run out of play and referee martinez says come on let's have the ball back and actually another ball has appeared so loris has taken that so even though the referee's over here plays underway and camo vinga is already advancing towards the halfway line france came back from two nil down now the three two down and then montiel just slides in catches camo vinga so late and he's taken him out around the shins i think he was already off the ground camo vinga there he saw it coming he stayed down there's a bit of a dust up now pushing and shoving most of the players on the field are involved in that but it's calmed down very quickly i think montiel knew what he was doing and every prince player knew what he was doing and reacted accordingly and a yellow card presumably that's parades yellow card from that right three kick four france out towards the left hand side colman has gone across there to take it the score line in this thrilling block buster 2022 world cup final is three to to argentina colman takes the three kick in players go down in the area take it away for argentina comes back to the right hand side kundae is there the the right back this pass is a little short the two ameni now canate heads it back to kundae and kundae's pass forward and then it's bouncing on the right hand side for canate and canate now looking across and that's blocked by the defender behind tally of kiko for a corner two friends french corner from the right five minutes to go another change is going to be made it's an argentina change that's it for lexus mccalister who the referee is is saying he's actually sort of leaned into him the referee is up to say come on you get yourself to the halfway line and it is german pesella of rail betis who is coming on central defender replacing midfielder play will resume with a french corner this is in the end to our right where all of those red white and blue flags are being waved so pesella is on colman with a corner for france this is a deep one or takes a flick off a couple of heads too many and bhabé with a shot that's blocked in the area the referee seen a handball two argentine defenders threw them in the way threw themselves in the way of that shot from him bhabé the referee was instant he pointed to the spot and he's seen the outstretched arm it's the right decision it's montiel and it's a penalty and then bhabé will have a chance to become the second man to score a penalty to become the second man to score a hat trick in a world cup final chris Sutton i don't think we could have any more drama i thought that was it de mary in tears on the bench for argentina bhabé has to pop this one in i thought it was a penalty yep i thought the arm was out as montiel just turned his back slightly and bhabé hammered the shot trying to find that far top corner what a moment what a moment indeed now he is up against the arch penalty saver from aston villa ameliano martinez who very nearly got the earlier penalty that he scored in this match but this a moment of history in a world cup final only sujeb perce to score a hat trick on the greatest stage of all but now killion and bhabé in the golden boots from the penalty spot attempting to score his second spot and the final it's there he said martinez the wrong way and france have now made it three three and killion and bhabé joins sujeb perce as a world cup final hat trick scorer what amazing drama we have witnessed here in doha in this world cup final and it's not over yet and bhabé now eight goals at this tournament three three well and bhabé golden balls what courage what belief what confidence to slot that in martinez dived left but the pace the accuracy from and bhabé actually think he slipped his foot gives away slightly but finds the corner this is going to go all the way messy scores in extra time and bhabé scores in extra time and now argentina are breaking forward and the ball almost bounces for messy 25 yards out but it's cleared away argentina three france three what a storyline and now messy picks up the ball and sets off running at the french defense defenders throw themselves in on the edge of the d and are able to block it away comes back for argentina out to the left hand side those argentina fans trying to suck this in akunya with the cross comes off kunday and spins away behind wider than the opposing behind for an argentina corner rob gree well let's start the game he said it's not all about messing and bhabé i'll take it all back by in fairness dimaria did score one of the goals so messy to take the corner from the left hand side what chance they both score a hat trick in the final not from here it's a corner that is whipped into the edge of the d france are able to clear it bounces down for kunday and he clears it out on the far side well we're in the last minute now of extra time there's added time to come you would guess two or three minutes judging by the standards of this world cup but it looks like there will be that extra drama at the penalty shootout and you've got to give france so much credit for digging themselves out of hole after hole and here they come now with him bhabé on the left hand side and then bhabé right foot across and a stretching head and it's just wide oh my goodness oh what drama well this is this is sensational from him bhabé because as the ball goes out to the left hand side naturally i think we're all thinking he's going to run at the argentinian back line but he gets his head up and whips in a tantalising ball and muwani what eight yards out i don't think he gets any contact on the header but it goes agonisingly past the far post and martinez was a full stretch i don't think i don't think he got anything on it france making another change de sassy the monocle defender is coming on for kunde and argentina also going to make a change it's debala coming on palo de bala is barely been involved in this world cup came on as a late substitute in the semifinal has had an injury coming into this but clearly debala coming on with penalties in mind and he is taking the place of tallya fecal that took an eternity to go wide it just drifted and bounced and slowly no one knew no one knew whether that was going in or not what game we've had haven't we just the club has been too many better world cup finals than this i remember a time when they were very often a let down world cup finals but not this one so three three when it looks as though only the third world cup final to go to penalties will be the outcome here in doha what a finale it's been ball is with argentina three minutes of time have been added at the end of this second period of extra time so there are still 90 seconds to play time for one last twist perhaps which is what kune is doing now twisting and playing the ball forward and debala is able to get a touch on that lutarro martinez can't get there france clear canate to the halfway line finandez plays it through the middle nessie plays it over the top lutarro martinez is in might have been fouled still going defender it comes out and the offside flag is up against lutarro martinez yeah it was offside it was never onside at any point so it was a clear offside and just the way these games can't you just never know well 40 seconds to play a chris sutton 40 seconds 606 to kune with you and robby savage you'll have plenty to talk about after this yeah i'm not quite thinking about 606 just at this moment job so penalty shootout seconds away france played over the top moine is in oh what a save by martinez stuck out a left leg came out get a star jump and moine's shot hit that left leg and now the final attack it's argentina and it's played forward into the area on the right flick the cross oh the header is wide from lutarro martinez from ten yards what a finish what a finish and the header well weighed he got it all wrong actually it was weighed by probably 10 yards he did but what a chance but the earlier one from moine the ball just helped up all over the back line of the argentinian defense and moine one on one just how crucial could that save be for martinez who only just went for power is thinking i'm going to put my foot through it and martinez spread himself brilliantly wrong huge huge save huge moment it was just he just made himself as big as he could was still playing i don't think the referee wants this to finish i don't think any of us do here's some babby who's set away by turemeni but down into the full back position babby taking on montiel one way and the other beats him again beats him again and babby's still going oh the cross comes to covering challenge between them if he'd scored that i would have walked out and that's it what a world cup final one of the best argentina three france three and everyone everyone on their feet inside this lucel stadium here in doha to give them a standing ovation what entertainment tristan yeah crazy crazy end to this game what has been a crazy game overall hasn't it somehow france dig deep again i've got to say i thought it was a penalty when it looked like messi had got the winning goal from a yard or two for argentina but that's saved from martinez i just wonder whether that could be the biggest moment in this game because moani should have scored but that's huge martinez at one end martinez at the other end and it's finished argentina three france three and baffe hatrig two from messi one from tim maria what a match pedal these become kelly and marg rob what a 120 minutes plus plenty of injury time as we've seen throughout this world cup it's been and as john said at the end of the 120 minutes everybody in the stadium on their feet bar a good percentage of the players who were on the pitch getting treatment for cramp it's taken everything out of everyone yeah me and chris were under the table as well absolutely exhausted it's just been a game of has had everything other than a red card i think and i won't write that off just yet but it's it's one way yeah france you have to give them so much credit for just picking themselves up off the floor continuously because you just could not give them a prayer after an hour they looked for lawn they just snapped your hands off now for penalties then for penalties now if you're going into a penalty shootout and you're the team that's come back from two nil down if you're the team that's come back from three two down which of them mentally do you think is in a better look you're both pulling faces that because if to say neither of them fine that's a valid answer yeah i'm with that one i i don't i really don't think it matters this is look it's a team game but this is so individual now these moments it's about uh belief and courage in your conviction now don't lose your nerve if you're a you're a player but it's easier said than done i mean this is as intense as it will get i've just i've just got a feeling for argentina with these penalties i normally get things wrong just because of that save at the end i thought that's such a significant save from martinez but who knows i just watching i was going to say but his head had chance as well rob two two minutes before he was cleaned through colin mearni his his head had chance as well it was two chances that if they fell to unbapate the game would have been gone it was done it was sealed the the the hour the second hour that unbapes had is it would have been finished it but they didn't but even still unbapate had the chance himself and didn't you so there's just so many twists and turns in this game can line up to something as well from me and rob when and when to take the penalty we both said martinez would save it we said and bapay would miss that how wrong were we well at bernie moe we've had a lot of discussions about the order of who takes penalties chris and i know you think it's utterly irrelevant messi went first in argentina's last shootout you would expect him to go first again and then imbapay to go first for the french and the penalties by the way are going to take place away to our left in front of the thousands and thousands of argentina fans behind that goal so the penalties are away to our left but messi and then imbapay or and bapay and then messi depending on who who's going first you're not bothered i i don't know i don't i don't think it matters the order at all okay i mean i would suggest that imbapay goes first wouldn't you kelly certainly if it was france i would suggest that it was going to be a bapay who would go first with you for the penalties and this is real playground stuff this is what kids do around the world they take penalties in the playground to win the world cup final for their country john marie and rob green but first of all ian denis and chris sutton thank you kelly thank you mark it'll be france to go first emi martinez remembers save the first two penalties against the dutch and it is and bapay who comes first you'd imagine that messi will follow suit he did against the nedelunds it's imbapay he scored a hat trick and he scored the first penalty right footed left hand side i think emi martinez got a hand on it well he's gone the same way every penalty he just backs himself it's a brilliant penalty i tell you what martinez yes flying to his right hand side left fingertips to the ball but enough power interesting choice that as well remember imbapay had the penalty saved against switzerland at the euros last year which was the decisive penalty this time imbapay took the first one and it is leon ol messi then messi who's already scored a penalty past loris in this match in normal time in the first half that was the opening goal so messi against loris tick two left foot oh loris went the wrong way but still had time to adjust but couldn't get there and it's in it's 1-1 in the shootout i don't think i've ever seen someone hit one so slowly and it's still going that is backing yourself he waited and watched and waited he took one to loris his left hand side first that one the other way loris it's just a fraction slow on it kingsley colemann comes forward he's placed the ball on the spot he was one of the players who'd been hit with his virus in the build up this final not the longest of run up for colemann right footed saved by martinez martinez with the heroics for argentina and colemann's had it saved just guesses the right way martinez it's quite a tame penalty from colemann it's not going right into the corner but martinez flies to his right hand side comfortable save advantage argentina so martinez makes the save save two penalties against the dutch in the shootout van dyke and burghouse and remember how martinez made those crucial saves in the copper america semi-final last year so di bala next for argentina left footed right down the middle and loris diving was left tried to get there with his feet but the ball was passed in low and in the net it's risky it's risky because he's it low if you're going to go straight give it a little bit of lift because a gulky book can always leave his feet there the trailing foot makes save it it's close sure then he now comes forward to france the only player in this french squad who started all seven games and emi martinez who saved those three penalties against columbia in the copper america semi-final has just tossed the ball away he's picked it up the argentinian supporters during that tournament loved him he was into the trash talking into the gamesmanship and he's adding again he saved the two penalties against van dyke and burghouse against the dutch he saved one already it's a shootout live on five live right france with q and then he he's missed it he's told me why they only converted one out of their three it's advantage argentina now yeah martinez was in too many's head there he actually threw the ball to the side made too many walk 20 yards and pick up the ball give him more thinking time little dance from martinez but argentina can't lose it from here so that makes it is still too long to argentina in the shootout they very much have the edge and it's parade he's now the paris angerman man on loan at your ventors steps back little steps now right footed penalty and it's beyond glorious down to his right it's in three one argentina lead and the shootout and they're on the brink again go hard go low he does both theories guesses right it's too hard too strong too good a penalty randall colin luani comes forward what pressure on the 24 year old who was only called up to the squad due to the injury to christopher and kungku martinez is shown a yellow card but he's now whipping up the crowd but the argentinian goalkeeper has just been booked colin luani has to score he runs up now and goes right down the middle with a powerful right footed finish and francis still in it yeah if in doubt put your foot through it luani right footed laces through the ball hammers it down the middle of the goal still hope montiel gonzalo montiel the right back the substitute he could be the man who wins it the son of a bricklayer and a cleaner is now here in catar with a chance to win the world cup for argentina and he comes right footed and scores and off comes the shirt and up goal the fans and argentina have won the world cup again for the first time since 1986 what a match what a finale and that penalty seals it for leon olmasi and his team and they're in raptures argentine celebrations all over the pitch in three different areas three different huddles the crowd are up there are hugs and kisses and tears great great french disappointment of course the holders lose at the last not able to retain the title but it is leon olmasi and his young muchachos who can celebrate it and there he is now right in the middle he's walked away on his own leon olmasi will cap his career here the crowning moment the crowning glory he's waving both hands above his head and he's blowing them kisses what a brilliant finish to a brilliant international career for the great little man the argentine number 10 and across come his teammates and the staff and envelop him in hugs four to the final score in the penalty shootout after a three-three draw drama of the highest standard and didier deshaun down there all on his own with his hands on his hips so close to successfully defending the title but have fallen just short robgreen chrisson a brilliant match one of the all-time world cup finals caps right fittingly to win it for one of the all-time players he has his moment everyone's exhausted players are out on their feet everybody has put everything into it it's been an amazing spectacle it's hard to know what to say isn't it you know messy looks like this is his final world cup what a way to go out that moves him up alongside the great diego maradona but what what drama that martinez save at the end of extra time and the argentinian state composed in the shootout martinez was in the french players heads wasn't he made a great save and and look i'm not so sure how i feel about loving the ball away from too many and making him go and pick the ball up but it did the trick feel for didier deshaun feel for his french team who showed so much resilience kept coming back and back again but it's messi's final it's argentina's final and to think they started this tournament losing to saudi arabia john and you feel also for killion and bathe scoring a hat trick in the world cup final and ending on the losing side but there we are diego maradona and friends won the world cup in 1986 in 2022 leonard messi and friends win the world cup in catar argentina three friends three and argentina win the shootout four two mark chatman kelly kitt they didn't know what to do at the end the argentina players chris they either went to messi they went to martinez after his heroics from the goalkeeping perspective in the shootout or and the one who was kind of forgotten kind of in it all was montiel who got the win who got the winning penalty he went off to celebrate in front of the argentina fans and very few of his teammates went with him majority stayed to hug messi and a load of them went to emilia martinas as well yeah and he was probably thinking where are where are my teammates why am i so unpopular after showing that that courage it was a brilliant penalty i mean the the pressure absolutely on but i mean what a game what an ending to the game did argentina deserve it i think they did over over the whole piece but just keep going back to that martinez save it in extra time but it went to penalties your fancy martinez over over larice but they got the job done didn't they didn't start this world cup in great form but it's not how you start it's how you finish in great celebrations they've had the best fans at the world cup there must be this stadium must be 80 full of argentinian fans and and the celebrations i mean these will go on deep deep into the night and again it would be amazing if we could hear those argentina fans properly over the the pa system but they're blaring out the celebration music and those fans are doing their best to create all this atmosphere robin was almost like a hogarth painting at the final whistle because it was just people spilling everywhere people were on their knees they were crouched they were hugging they were falling over it was absolute chaos on both sides and the and the france players sort of on the the right hand side of the pictures we look at it but the argentina players down there it was the andro martinez just on his knees hunched on his own waiting for somebody to to go over to him as chapa said nobody knew what to do but now they do and now they're over celebrating with that hardcore of argentina fans who are behind the goal where the ultras who in domestic football are like oil and water are standing next to each other they're standing on top of the barriers they're arm in arm and they're celebrating with argentina this feels like a win that means much more than just supporting the players this feels like it matters it it was such a roller coaster that that's why and everyone's emotionally and physically completely shattered from the game and they're all just so discombobulated as a team that they just had to do their own thing at their own moment and it manifested itself in this chaotic team which is brilliant but you think about the pressure from the start of the tournament on one player in particular but throughout that team who had to provide for him and how they must have felt throughout the tournament building up to it and then to finally get there and get that moment for him is just just overwhelming for everybody involved with argentinian football amazing scenes are there at the moment with uh scoloni and i'm i'm guessing his family and they're in tears and he's hugging them and then messi and de maria who have been through so much together at international level suffered so many times and are now being victor well surprised you to learn by the way that's how he's doing that on the big screen they've given the player of the match guess he that gave that to well you can see it chris i mean that's a rubbish quiz and they're giving it to leonard messi i mean anyone of argentinian midfielders could really have claimed to take the player of the match but it's gone to messi but you look you look at the the bonds that have been created through through this team in these players and there will also chris there but there must be a sense of relief amongst them that they have managed to deliver it for the man who has won player of the match they have been playing under that pressure yes absolutely and you know and losing the first game i mean we can't lavish enough praise on on the manager as well you know when he took over it was a job nobody really wanted you know went out in the last 16 at the last world cup in russia and you know huge pressure taking over a job of such such magnitude but he's found a way and so of this argentinian team throughout this world cup you know it's been it's been little moments magical moments and then today you just wondered you know they get themselves in front they let it slip badly as they did against the netherlands they got over the line that night but then once and back they get to three all you're thinking you know maybe this could go against argentina but it's job done and i think most people around the world you know would feel that it is i mean rob rob's words were great you know it's this is a fitting end for leonard messi who has been one of the world's very best if not the best that's a debate which we can have for another day but it does seem fitting it does seem right that he leaves with winning the big one question that in bapain now does that count as scoring four in the final and still losing in a penalty shootout you don't get it you don't get the fourth with the penalty shootout but yeah they'll take home the golden boot in whatever form that comes but i will imagine it be scant consolation because argentina have won the world cup and the celebrations continue down there are south american football correspondent tim vickery joins us now tim when we look at the the scenes of celebration anybody's going to enjoy winning the world cup but this argentina story has been a long time building to this moment it felt like the last chance it is the last chance for leonard messi and it is the last chance for those players to do it for messi as well yeah for story has to end unfortunately we're going to have to say goodbye to him let it end like this i have some breaking news december the 18th has just been announced as the official day of the argentine cardiologist what a day they've just had it was a it was a horrible way to end the game remember i i hate the penalty shootout it individualizes a collective sport it only ends because they're a they're a villain someone has to fail but i thought it was an awful way to get what on the day was was the right results uh we wondered about the the team selection before and scoloni with his team selection what he said was my team is more important than the opposition i'm not going to go with the three centre backs and and and wait on the basis that their team is more important than mine i'm going to prove that our team is more important and it worked wonderfully well didn't it while demaria was on the field they played the three across the front it was very bold there with alvarez between messi and and demaria wide left they they gave france problems playing out they outnumbered france in midfield they amplified the space that the french midfield had to cover it was the first time that grisman as a midfielder became a problem argentina made grisman as a midfielder a problem and while demaria was on the field and has there ever been a world-class player with less ego than demaria whatever you need him to do he does he hasn't got a set role if you wanted to play wide right if you want him to play wide left if you want him to play him in the midfield three he'll do that fantastic performance from him but once he went off the game started to change and you wonder because every time the argentina defensive unit has been really priced under pressure it's almost as if the presence of the fans in the stadium becomes an inhibiting factor they're all having a collective nervous breakdown the fans are making the players nervous the players are making the fans nervous and as soon as france got one you thought they're going to get two here and anything could have happened in the the crazy last few minutes of normal time argentina i thought rallied really really well in extra time but it could have gone against them right at the last but i think in a horrible way we've had the right results they're still building the stage here in lucella it's taken them a long time to do that the argentina players don't mind they are celebrating with their fans whilst a few of them do interviews for television there's a great big drum on the pitch as well that one of the backroom staff is beating at the moment as they dance and sing in front of their fans gilya and lara has come up to join us as well i feel like i ought to give you a hug but then that might make it worse really i don't know for you and there will be a just a sense of what if for france really on on various different levels over the course of that game yeah you are i mean they show great character to come back not just once but the twice three two in extra time i thought all of us thought it was over and then kelly and still manages to find a way of scoring the other penalty and i mean i think it's cruel to lose like this of course and everybody in front would be hardworking the players crying on the bench right now with somebody again dizzy with kelly and embappé my own children crying as well at home which is normal i guess because you were so close and yet and yet just for a couple of penalties two really really good save one really good save and one miss and they will learn a lot from it and i don't know who will be there in germany or the euros who will be there in the next world cup in last world but this should also be like a big learning curve macron is actually or has been down on the field trying to go soul killing embappé as well i go back to euro 96 with england and honestly they show that gaza uh champs right to the end where he just misses his toe and it goes to penalties i sense in france you will see cola moani's header and actually his chance later on as well over and over and over again for the next years and cola moani will wake up i would imagine in his sleep seeing certainly the head well both of those chances yeah you're right for such a young player i mean you will have to deal with it of course and not that he would be blamed for it but it's a huge chance what at the end it's an amazing save i don't he could have done it differently but it's it's not it's i mean christ is looking at me with big eyes no i think with the header he was a little bit unlucky i don't know whether the ball was too far you know it was all a blur i'd love to see that again i think that the chance at the end he just rushed rushed this shot he could have actually composed himself and lifted it because martinez had just committed and was flying out of the only way he went low didn't he yeah he could have actually lifted it look it's easy to say no no sitting up here but that's one that he will not forget yeah no you're right and it's a situation where your best players are on the bench as well you know giro and grisman and it's the kids turam colomani the command is not so much of a kid but who for fanatron in midfield who carried you out of this incredible poor first hour and it's incredible the deserve credit is it's sad to lose that way it's very cruel but you have to give credit to messy in argentina as well because they were still fantastic and and probably the better side of all over the whole of the world in tournaments the huge cheer is because leonard messy has been out with a microphone in the middle of the pitch addressing the argentina supporters and the cheer was just because he spoke not because they could hear a word of what he was saying but he ended with a huge famos i don't know if it's coming through but they are chanting messy's name every single one of them chanting for leonard messy they're making the kind of we're not worthy arms as he as he kind of makes his way around the pitch and shows his appreciation for the supporters as well but it's hard to convey because we're trying to fight with this kind of canned music it's hard to convey just how much noise and how much emotion is coming out of those argentina fans but the fact that messy came out and spoke to them and presumably said his goodbyes this will be his final game he has said in an argentina shirt he's changed his name before but why not go out on the high of winning the world cup i mean i'm not sure they could hear him either really just the fact that he he had the microphone and was on the big screen was enough to send them cheering there are kids in that crowd with the fake at least i hope that's the fake world cup otherwise they managed to nick that from somewhere with the fake world cup at the front of the crowd the ultras the argentina ultras who have been there since two hours before kickoff and they don't they don't sit in their seats they don't even stand in front of their seats the front row and mike has joined us as well the front row actually stands on on the wall basically between the pitch and the seats and they have been there from two hours before the game all the way through the 90 minutes they might have sat down for 10 minutes when it got a little bit scary towards the end of the second half just for a breather but the the scenes are like nothing we we have seen before no it's been absolutely fantastic i mean where you guys were sitting i was actually sitting to the right use and i there was about i don't know 100 argentina fans just in front of me and the noise and the support that they gave was amazing but these alters just behind the goal they've been fantastic i can only compare it to the morocco fans they were brilliant too but these have been here for for hours and they've really made the atmosphere in the game and this is what we that's what we come here to see i know it's probably been said loads of times already but that is the best game of football i have ever seen ever undoubtedly i was honestly out my emotions were like a wreck i was up i was down one minute i was a killing and bapu thunder that was a messy fun and it was just a great game of football wow it was a fantastic game of football but in the end there had to be a winner only one team are going to go and lift the world cup at the end of all of this and it went down to penalties it swung each way at the beginning argentina two nail up they looked like they were coasting on 80 minutes killing and bapu got a penalty to bring it back to 2-1 then a fantastic finish to make it to all it goes into extra time leon al messi of course with a goal that we'd looked at it by the bar to see whether or not it was offside he was given onside was that it but with 10 minutes to go of extra time killing bapu again brought fans level with a penalty and that took it to penalties the winning penalty for argentina was scored by guanzalo montiel this is how it sounded in argentina oh tamed it how fishermen's friends in argentina yeah and he's uh he's going to be gargling with pebbles for a fair while i think tomorrow that that one isn't it but isn't there some beautiful poetry in the fact that the fellow who takes the last the decisive kick is probably the least glamorous one on the field you know gonzalo montiel he's the reserve right back uh and it just highlights that this is a collective sport so i think there's there's lovely poetry in that it could have been messy no but messes out there taking the first one and it's the least glamorous player who puts it in and confirms the triumph for argentina which i think i think sends out a lovely message but it's it's never just about one player no the the basic rule of football is that the star shines when the team is right and the argentina after that desperately shocking opening day defeat to saudi arabia they've had to put things right they've had to tinker here they've had to tinker there and messi has had a supporting cast in his last world cup which is worthy of him and the last dance has been the best dance i'm so sorry that the story has to end but let it end this way the last time he was in the world cup final pablo zabaleta was one of his teammates he's been part of our coverage throughout the world cup on bbc radio and bbc television he's been in the studio with gary linica this afternoon uh once the penalties had taken place gary asked him how he was feeling pablo can you speak oh i know tell me what this means to argentina i mean um it's one of those moments sorry yeah i mean that's okay i was just looking at messy and uh i know what it means i feel the same and i'm out of the brilliant it's just um well done to france and buffet i mean thank you for everybody for that great game but a perfect story for messy world and and everybody i mean we really enjoy it i like the guys say i'm i'm so pleased and so happy to to be here but i enjoy getting there i know you're emotional and quite right quite rightly so so all those people in there tell us what it will mean to leonel messy someone that you know very well i mean um i've been part of that uh team the youth team when when he came for the first time to play for the national team and you know he he came to to represent his country and and and the passion and the respect that he always shown for the for our country something that we always need to appreciate it's not that long ago of course we retired from international football because of the defeat in the cop america the third one that they had in the final he was distraught he couldn't handle it anymore but he's come back now he's won not only the cop america but now the greatest prize of the year and he deserved it 100 look everyone is just crying and and giving a big hurt of le mar and and everybody because um you know he's one of those players he really really deserved it so for them that was pablo zabaleta speaking just after argentina scored that winning penalty in the shootout to win the world cup tim vickery is still with us tim there's a really emotional response from pablo zabaleta there and it's been a really emotional tournament all round for argentina just try and give us some context to that starting with it being the first world cup that diego maradona wasn't around for the the the shadow if you like that they cast or the light that he shines on on this argentina team the fact that it is mesi's last tournament probably mesi's last ever game that there have been people like pablo zabaleta and teammates throughout the years who've tried to deliver this for leo mesi and that finally at the last possible moment they've been able to do it and we can hear them a chacha song which brings all of that into context that's it that's it yeah that that's stolen my line they're they're singing it for you no they're singing about all those finals that we lost and all those years that that that i cried but now now it now it's all over that's because they won the cop america last year and i don't think they'd won this world cup had they not won the cop america last year that took some of the responsibility off it made the atmosphere a little bit lighter because that was their first senior title since 1993 it's 28 years and when you have as many cop americas as south america does an argentina are one of the big two you expect to win titles much more and much more frequently than that but they felt jinxed i mean mesi when he retired briefly in 2016 from international football he said that it was because that he was he was feeling jinxed and that there's lots of players who are part of this process zabaleta is one and i remember i've told you this many times but seeing mesi for the first time wearing a shirt of argentina when he was a 17 year old in the south american under 20 championship start of 2005 pablo zabaleta was in that side playing on on the the right side of midfield he's he's he's been part of the process mesi's old mate sergio aguero he's on the pitch now he's been part of the process many of them they couldn't quite get over the line this generation have got over the line it's the best team in a collective sense that mesi's been part of in argentina he's joined the group the group of join him he's surrounded by his disciples if you like and they've brought the trophy home the stadium has been plunged into darkness as they start the process of the world cup trophy presentation there are various awards that get handed out obviously the french players have to take their pick up their runners-up medals as well it's going to be a fairly lengthy process is this it's actually been brutal jewels for the french players for the last five ten minutes and so they've come back out onto the field and because of the the way this is being staged they've been put very very close to the celebrating argentina players yeah i think it's probably even worse than actually losing the game because now they're all standing there they clearly in front of them like i don't know 10 yards out the argentine players celebrating with their families you see the children running around the wives the parents all the photographers are not far and then they have to stand there clearly miserable of course just waiting for their turn to go and get a medal that they don't want and and and still thinking about the chances that they missed the penalties that they missed it's cruel we said it is brutal that they can only be one winner and when you lose that way and i was there in 06 as well when they lost on penalties in a very very different game of course no rollercoaster of emotion but the zidane red cards and that that hurt jules you said last night in a way you could win both ways because either you get to see fans win the world cup or you're there for leon on messy winning the world cup in his last ever game that's how you felt last night it might even be how you felt on 79 minutes but once france got back into that game once there was a taste of it is that when it changed it changed completely Kelly you're right you're so i mean this is history that we're witnessing we're very lucky all of us here from five live and all the people the 80 000 people in the stadium to see this happening and to see messy lifting this trophy of course this is this is something very very special very emotional but i'm i'm good i won't lie and at two in a we said at halftime there will be no party for the french and then we believed again and this team is wonderful and what we said last night is that they went all this way by cutting the emotions off of all their games and today of all games the rollercoaster of emotions that they went through was just a bit too much and they just couldn't do that because argentina were great because it's a final it's the world cup and in the end i think the penalties were too much and i could have told you before that martinez who is the master of man games of trash talking we saw it even the referee didn't really know what to do with him but this is part of the game and i knew there will be only one winner and anyway as i think rob all chris was saying is is fitting that it's a little messy for everything that's done for this game is it part of the game rob green what martinez was doing at the end he pushed it to the limit didn't he he got booked and he should have been booked before that so he was going to go until he got booked and i think if the referee was on it a bit more could have done it earlier but that's the game and that's part of it and chris pointed out just give them time to think and that they will make a mistake and that's all you have as a goalkeeper because if they hit a penalty well you're not going to save it so you need them to make an error your your guess is as good as mine what's going on down here at the moment because the playing surface is plunged into darkness bar the stage big white stage the medals have just been carried on the sort of mixed reaction you may have heard was gianni in fantino leading out the presentation party i'm sure in the middle of that are some of the ruling members of the catari family as well president macron is involved in that party too um john murray maybe we should or ian denis one of you maybe we should have had this discussion before we came on air how are we doing this john will do the ceremony but just to quickly say this has been a record world cup the six goals here today we've now witnessed more goals than any other world cup 172 here in catar it was previously brazil 2014 in france 98 where they'd witnessed the joint record of 171 so we've had the biggest attendance for a final since 94 and a record number of goals out here in catar in the last 29 days which micah is quite surprising because towards the end of the group stages we thought we were close to getting a record number of nil nil draws in this tournament that's just the games we were working on yeah maybe it was yeah i don't know you were watching i had a lovely time go mark and micah go do the tv one that gary doesn't want to do that was it was my favorite close another nil nil but look at this deno said it has now been a record goal scoring world cup it has been a world cup in which being on messy is is going to very shortly be able to lift the trophy killing and bap a getting to the the final we've seen stars like neymar we've seen someone like christiana ronaldo almost certainly bring his international career to an end we saw it with robert levin dotsky almost certainly bringing his international career to an end there have been huge moments in this deno in this world cup and it's been significant in in many ways and for individuals as well as teams very much so obviously the first african side to reach the last four huge from oracle first time ever in a world cup that all five nations from africa have won at least one game i think the first time since 2002 that you've had three different sides from different kind of confederations reaching the semi finals and obviously moving forward the format is going to change when we go to mexico canada and the united states in four years time but for for argentina to get their first trophy since 36 years and i just think as well of the final just a great final wasn't it just just pure entertainment drama it had everything and uh it's going to live live long in the memory it is difficult to think of a better final john moray isn't it it is i think you know there have been some gold packed finals over the years some one sided finals and as i mentioned during the commentary actually there was this period we went through where there were some pretty turgid ones as well you know time after time but this will go down this will go down as an absolute classic you're probably looking back to 1970 you know in terms of great world cup finals you know that famous the brazilian win and carlos alberto's goal but uh this is right up there so how they went for creuatia 2 in 2018 six goals was the most since 1958 when brazil beat sweden 5 2 and we've just had another six goals here so what they do now here on the stage is they're going to present all the individual awards then we'll get the runners-up medals and then we will get argentina getting their medals and finally finally finally at the end of all of that leonel messi will lift the world cup trophy so the first award has just been handed out and that's the fifa young player award and that has gone to you can hear the argentina asking enzo enzo so that has gone to enzo finandez who let's not forget chris didn't actually start that first game did he again sadio rapid no that's that's right and then he came on in the second game against mexico and scored that wonderful goal from just inside the just the corner of the 18-yard box fired it into the far top corner and then he's been an ever-present ever since they the next game against coland and he's been he's been really important scoloni thinking on his feet you know didn't start the competition but he's been a really big player for that uh for the argentinian team playing in that pivot roll um screening the back line uh the argentinian back line who have been to purple tournament uh and uh i i get why has won that award it's hard to think of of other candidates right now it's been that sort of afternoon and evening but i mean he has been top draw hasn't he the golden glove award rob green goes to emi martinez and it could have been given to him just for his penalty shootout exploits but it's not it's about keeping the most glee sheets continuing the fewest goals across this tournament yeah and it's been interesting hasn't it chris pointed it out we we had a look at the amount of saves he's actually made and it's not many they have been crucial saves one at the end of this this game one against australia as well when it was tight when it's two one in injury time and then the penalty saves as well so you look at it we're all going to talk about the great man messi and the team that's been built around it but he's played a huge part of the success and this is hard next the golden boot award goes to kylian and bapé who has to go up on his own with all the disappointment and losing the world cup final despite scoring a hat trick he has to talk to all the dignitaries president macron gives him the golden boot there are a few whistles and then they turn to cheers because as we keep saying this is a mostly argentina crowd jewels yeah i mean he won't be happy with that because that's not really the trophy that's the trophy he wanted but not not the only one and i think you could see with his body language still three goals in a world cup final the only player to do that research of first of course in 66 he's got four goals in world cup finals more than anybody else now more than tolay more than jago more than leo more than all the greatest of all time so for him he's been a very good world cup that he will obviously be disappointed i love the fight that he took the first penalty because remember at the euro's 18 months ago against switzerland he waited to be the fifth one he took it he missed it and we were knocked out this time he went first like messi because that's the way it should be and and he's called four goals as john was saying earlier he doesn't count or then or he doesn't really count as a four as a fourth goal but still still i mean he's still he's still he's still a fantastic sir jeff herst has said many congratulations to him bap a whatever happens i know great run but this noise it's for the goals and goal award he's on the stage now is leon on messi and once again he's going past all the dignitaries he has the golden ball award for the tournament's best player john you were gonna say gonna say and bap a looked as though he'd rather be anywhere else than on the stage there he had to walk past the world cup itself and he could barely look at it he gave it a quick glance and then just looked straight on past it and he looked you know he looked as they could not be less interested in the golden boot award oh by contrast leon on messi has just smiling with his individual award has just walked past the world cup given a little rub at the top and kissed it and i had to look at what's to come that had to look at i'll see you later john Murray oh my oh dear taking a turn it has hasn't it really feel slightly uncomfortable uh messi uh stands further down the and takes the acclaim of the crowd it is very harsh because what they're making them do as well and it and it's fine for messi and it's fine for emi martinez and also for enzo finandez as well but for killing em bap and only did he have to walk past the world cup he then had to keep going and he then had to stand on his own uh with the golden boot for a photo and now now they are i mean i know it i know this is what happens but now they've made him come back onto the stage with emi martinez and leon on messi enzo finandez didn't know he had to go back on the stage so they had their photos then they called em bap back because finandez wasn't there and the three argentina players are smiling and there is a grimace shall we say on killing em bap's uh face and you would have to have a heart of stone not to feel sorry for him there yeah i agree with you trappers and i mean there was no way he was going to smile and know him too well for that photo and it's not photo he's going to keep anywhere in his house either it's it's one that he will have to learn from of course because for 70 70 minutes in this game he was knowing the game either so again loads of things to learn from the french point of view and then you just have to accept the defeat with with class because that's because that's why it should be despite the cruel end of the game and then also in the darkness there was a there was an easy way back for him to get back to his french teammates and now they're making them walk the longest way back around the stage he's gonna have to walk past the celebrating argentina players and in fact he's gonna have to then go and join the back he's gonna have to hurry up to join the back of the french players who are now growing up in the garden of honor sorry i know you can see exactly what i can see that i'm not sure if you'd missed it ridiculous thing is you're long-sighted so you needed your glasses on didn't have them on you've got it there and you still saw it i've got my glasses on for being short sighted so a right mess at the moment i could see distance but i can't see any notes in front of me and you'll see no evil and the french mark i've got to say the garden of honor that's that's not for me if i'm too many walking past martinez you know after what happened in the uh in the penalty shooter where martinez lobbed the ball away i wouldn't really want to be walking past it okay but okay but at the end of it you have to the final whistle has gone and you have to respect each other don't you so what what so what would you have done if you were too many and that was like i just i just i just really wouldn't have enjoyed walking past martinez after after what he did you know he lobbed the ball away i mean that's you know that's you know it's okay so they have to be sporting then but big moment okay you wouldn't have to look at him you could just keep your head down jules as the as the france team do make their way onto the stage and they collect those medals that as you said earlier they really don't want they're going to pick them up they're barely going to look at them most of them and and they're going to go i don't know into a pocket or somewhere you imagine they'll be posting them back to them after this because they might not even take them out of the dressing room it's happened before but you already earlier on were looking ahead to the next tournament to the euros in germany to the next world cup in america and canada and mexico because there are so many young players in this france squad this doesn't feel like their last chance to win a major trophy no you're right because this is this the future is bright for this generation the next one as we were saying yesterday on the preview is is pretty good as well and and they will to a many will become a better player for tonight of course he will and so will for fana and so will upamecano and so will kamabinga in that left back position and kilian as well of course he will and as much as he will hurt now and for the next 10 days while they're on holidays or a week or so then they will have to move on and and the best way of moving on is to is to go into the germany euros in 2024 with big ambitions and i mean if you look at when they won in in 98 for example the 96 euros in england they lost that semi final on penalties against the cheque 2018 they had that final they lost in 2016 at the euros against portugal in in extra time very often not just the french but in general i mean we talked about mesi who lost that final eight years ago against germany very often you learn from those defeats from those heartbreaks and it's the same for england we were mentioning the other day and then you it comes into you you learn from me and you come back stronger after and that's what they will have to do as much as it must be horrible for them to have to watch the argentine because that's why you have to do now they're going to walk down the stage but since they're here on the pitch and wait for mesi to leave the trophy they've all collected their medals and they're all walking down the stairs and so we are left with one ceremony to perform for argentina to be crowned the world champions winning the world cup here in catar 2022 and their captain leonel mesi will finally get his hands on that gold trophy to talk you through this final historic ceremony at this world cup john morrick well i think here at catar 2022 they've taken post match presentations to a new level the stage is actually the figure of age local of this world cup so it is there in white it's lit up by spotlights and floodlights i think the fireworks are in place as well and one by one the argentina squad are going to be called up to receive their medals before the trophy is presented so this is the process really of cementing what will be that third star above the badge on the famous blue and white shirts and one by one the argentina players are coming up and receiving their medals it's the chief president janny infantino who is at the head of the line of dignitaries the emean of the state of catar is there as well his highness shake tamim and ummanuel macron the french president is next in line and and so it goes on alexander cheffrin of uefra is up there as well and there's alexis mccallister of brighton and hove albion as well the first brighton and hove albion player to appear in a world cup final and what a match he had before he was eventually substituted the goalkeeper the first astan villa player to appear in a world cup final is there moving along the line and i can see in the shadows in the darkness i can see leonel messi waiting as the last man to walk onto the stage two goals in the world cup final what a way to see out his world cup career on the day he became the first man to make 26 appearances at world cup finals two in a match so here comes the coach now leonel scaloni with an argentina flag around his neck what a moment for him he was the assistant coach to george sanpaoli four years ago when it ended at the hands of france in the last 16 and the assistant took the job in the end eventually succeeded him it was felt he was the cheap option and scaloni moves down the line and leaves the way clear for leonel messi what a moment this is i think when we all came here today we felt that there would be there would be a great story to end this world cup final but we didn't know quite how dramatic and exciting it would be and now leonel messi walks forward leonel messi just waiting for the nod his highness the amir is now moving across with jhani infantino and either side of him they uh they're actually putting it a golden cloak around his shoulders and they're they're putting his hands through the arms of that that cloak and he looks a little bit bewildered and what they're doing to him there and it is jhani infantino who will pick up the world cup the world cup that great gleaming golden trophy that was handed to daniel passorella in guena series in 1978 in 1986 that golden trophy was handed to diego maradona and now 36 years on it is now being placed in the hands of leonel messi and he receives it and he smiles and he kisses it and he cradles it in his arms and he kisses it again and now he takes little steps little leonel messi steps with the world cup in his hands and he walks into the center of all of his young and muchachos and he lifts the world cup and argentina are the winners and leonel messi and his team will take the trophy back to guena series and to argentina and what we've witnessed here today what we are seeing here now at this christmas world cup proves that dreams do come through what a night what an occasion and after all of the reservations and worries about this world cup many of which were very well founded concerns and reservations it's ended with a night to remember and argentina as the world cup winners a night to remember for argentina a night to remember the leonel messi who hasn't let go of that trophy yet only now is it past the angel de maria to look at but for 30 seconds after he joined his teammates he was holding on to that world cup and he wasn't letting it go and i am guessing tim vickery i know you're not there but in argentina there will not be a dry eye certainly won't be you know tournament football there are two elements to it one is that time speeded up seems suddenly changed they suddenly come together like enzo finand is coming into the side during the course of the tournament now you can't imagine argentina without it but they're also process and this process started copper america 2019 in in brazil when messi had clearly decided argentina the argentine national team was going to be his number one priority what did he have to do to make it right he had to be different with the players he had to be more vocal more encouraging he had to be the leader and he's been supported by almost a group of disciples here who wanted to make him happy and here he is the eno messi and his amazing technicolor dream coach holding the world cup a lot leaving the stage we fear i never wanted this moment to happen but if it has to happen let it be this way it is quite an extraordinary black net curtain edged in gold that the eno messi has been coerced into wearing but he won't care all he will care about is what he has in his hands and tim in the domestic game eno messi had won everything and what's been fascinating about his time with argentina is that it took as an argentina international it took him for one of a better phrase to discover his inner outhouse in order to be able to get success oh they loved that when he was swearing van haal and the dutch players after they absolutely loved it it was like almost like definitive proof you know what he's one of us he's not a catalan anymore and i think even this is calculated you know even the vocabulary that he uses uh i think he really is he sat down and thought what do i have to do how can i become more argentine and he's uh in that quiet self-contained methodical way he's gone about everything he needed to do surrounded by it as i say this group of disciples and i actually think it's beautiful poetry that the least glamorous player in the squad the reserve right back montiel is the one whose kick will always be remembered as clinching the 2022 world cup and in the in the middle of there at the moment is Sergio Aguero who who has put on a number 19 i think he had a 19 shirt on did he did he take a spare off the mendy shirt i don't know but he he had a 19 shirt on and he's raised it as well because you know this is a squad this is a backroom staff team that very much relies on former players former internationals there are several of them there and pablo's abaleta was telling us pre-match how much this has helped this current squad no doubt about it but the aguero thing is interesting because when scoloni took over four years ago he didn't want to pick aguero and aguero was flying at the time with man city that was because there was a feeling that messi only ever talked to his old mate aguero so it was a way of trying to force him to be more outgoing and talk to other people so that there was that problem that was identified if messi doesn't imagine if you're a young player called up to the argentine national squad all you want to do in training is win his respect and if he doesn't talk to you if you don't know where you stand with him you maybe doesn't rate me that was having an inhibiting effect on the younger players so messi has changed his behavior and aguero there is representing not only himself but aguero is representing all of those players like pablo's abaleta who have been part of the messi years and who couldn't quite get their hands on the silverware i think that's something that's useful to see tim a word on the future for argentina because there were times during this tournament that we've seen what that might look like without leon on messi both in terms of the way that they will play going forward and in terms of the people that might take on that mantle yeah that link up between enzo bananas and hulin hulin alvarez former club mates at river plate that that looks very very important indeed uh and there are some good players coming through perhaps defense is a little bit of a worry and it won't be the same it can't be the same it wasn't the same without dig on maradona they were always trying to get him to come back even when he really shouldn't have come back and he got himself in in problems in the world cup 94 because of that they were always looking for the saviour well now once messi has gone he's gone you've got to look beyond him it's not going to be the same it's not going to be what we enjoy today but there there there are there's no reason to to despair and this group i think will have gained considerable self-esteem from the fact that they had to dig so deep and a number of times during the championship to get themselves over the line so it's it's it's not going to be anything like as beautiful as as global as it is with with messi because even here in brazil i think more people were supporting argentina than supporting france and that's extraordinary and a lot of that is down to messi it's not going to be like this again but it's not going to be a disaster tim vickery for the final time for this world cup thank you so much for joining us it's been an absolute pleasure as leon on messy brings his children on to the pitch here at the sales stadium to celebrate becoming a world champion and in fact talked earlier about Sergio Aguero's shirt whether it had otamendi's number 19 or not doesn't matter anymore they are now all wearing argentina shirts with campiones del mundo on the back of it they are the world champions we have about five minutes left jules is still here johnny and rob christ just a final a final thought from you jules on this whole experience yeah i mean it's been great once again to be with that french team to be with them every day to follow them you feel part of the adventure of course and and then that's why he hurts so much as well because it's hard to detach yourself from being part of it in a way but they've done the country proud a country that was full of skepticism when we start when we flew over here a squad that lost so many talented players so many of them missing so many starters as well and yet to reach this height and go that far was amazing to show the heart and the character that it shows for kelly ann and batte to score three goals in this final but it was written in the stars somewhere that this was always going to be leo mrs walk up and and it happened thank you for everything you've done with us thank you so much for the last four weeks uh we will we will talk again soon of course we will jules thank you as you learn along with us rob let and let me start with you what as far as the football is concerned what has stood out for you i think for me it's been uh a real lesson of keeping the group of four in the group stages there's talk of it losing it for the next tournament going back to a three i don't think that works i think the every group stage had something on it by the end and that i think that was brilliant as a spectacle and then from there just the stories that have come from it for individual teams the history that's been made and the entertainment that's been there we've been had world cups that have had stodgy games defensive games and we've gone into these games going oh this could be keiji but it wasn't it was anything but so it's been a brilliant experience and it's been brilliant to work with everyone here and uh yeah what a great four weeks yeah been great to work with you too rob is that what you're is that what you were fishing for there yes there was a lot of silence obviously to do with you sorry big thanks yeah yep there was a lot of silence and also that must be sincere because you said it's sitting next to ian denis deno thoughts on the on the tournament well the football has been terrific cap by an incredibly dramatic wonderful remarkable final thrilling but i think the other thing is as well is that logistically i wondered how they're going to pull it off when you had eight stadiums in the space of like 46 miles and logistically they have pulled it off so uh the debate will go on about kata's legacy and and all the issues that surrounded it coming into the tournament but i do think that they have pulled it off very very well with 64 games in such a close proximity and we've had a record world cup with the amount of goals so um yeah that was what i would say it it's a world cup in a city and that's never happened before and there were as you say there were huge doubts about that and it may be something that they they look at again because it has changed the atmosphere of a world cup you know a winter world cup has caused a number of problems with the schedule and the calendar and what have you and it has been in Pep Guardiola's words and in set this is an insane season kata i think will now look towards the olympics but i think what they've shown with this world cup is that logistically they can certainly pull that off john moray the football has been great the best match was probably saved till last actually of memorable games this is probably being the most memorable um i still think we should always ask the question and we have asked this before when leaving south africa when leaving brazil when leaving russia what happens when the world cup party leaves and that is as relevant as and as important now as it has ever been well maybe what's happened here over the course of the last four weeks has actually changed the opinion and made people who live here think about things and how life is how the world works etc etc i think it's been it's been a fascinating month and i don't know about you all but i do feel conflicting emotions about what we've experienced over the course of of the last month some things here have been great you know a real really much better than than expected when we came here with some trepidation but you still have those reservations and and everything that was said in the build-up to this you know our our superb sports news team at the bbc and all of the other journalists who who worked and have asked questions about this world cup all of that still applies all of that applies and you know point people towards the there's a special bbc sports desk podcast at the moment which is all about how this world cup will be remembered what the legacy was will be and as ian says you know those questions remain and that debate must continue you know and the light has to continue to be to be shone here as well but um you know from a inner footballing sense there've been some brilliant memories brilliant experiences and um you know it's not been it's not been quite what we expected at all and and i think as you say mark it'll be very interesting i think as time goes by to see how we look back and think of this world cup",
