[96.40 - 102.84] P:1582.50 E:0.102768 |  Was a lovely pass from Elliott Anderson not enough pressure on the ball from Latvia is clearly offside
[102.84 - 105.80] P:1546.17 E:0.101874 |  I mean the linesman keeps his flag down to a quite late, but
[106.88 - 111.64] P:1493.01 E:0.109089 |  They're gonna have to have good movement around the area because I'm looking at the setup of Latvia
[111.64 - 114.88] P:1477.57 E:0.099412 |  I mean it's a 5-4-1 really that there's just gonna be players
[115.40 - 119.92] P:1453.37 E:0.100407 |  Banked everywhere across the middle of the pitch and tight line. So it's gonna require
[120.76 - 124.32] P:1466.34 E:0.106296 |  Shifting them about and moving the ball quickly and maybe some adventurous passes
[125.08 - 127.08] P:1532.90 E:0.102989 |  Rice wins the ball

[138.28 - 140.28] P:1615.21 E:0.083472 |  Spence
[141.00 - 142.80] P:1690.86 E:0.117310 |  Now it's with John Stones
[142.80 - 146.40] P:1697.82 E:0.102515 |  Thomas Tuchel who's made his way across the athletics track watching on
[146.96 - 150.84] P:1618.62 E:0.105326 |  Being serenaded by the England supporters. I think he was so focused on the game
[150.84 - 153.16] P:1647.36 E:0.099217 |  He was unaware that they were actually singing his name
[153.88 - 158.92] P:1474.17 E:0.098938 |  Biggest biggest technical area you've ever seen that I'm just a little so five a side pitching it is. Yeah
[159.76 - 166.36] P:1357.74 E:0.103046 |  You can understand why the Latvian players don't like playing here in terms of the atmosphere because you just completely
[166.64 - 169.08] P:1530.07 E:0.099041 |  Detached aren't you as a player? Yeah, you know
[169.08 - 173.36] P:1519.98 E:0.107114 |  No stand on the far side without the trees here is that stones
[174.32 - 179.56] P:1387.16 E:0.111068 |  And already England have every outfield player in the Latvia half a way towards our left-hand side
[180.00 - 182.40] P:1599.02 E:0.102990 |  Spence rolls it forward looking to try and get
[183.28 - 185.48] P:1561.98 E:0.110461 |  Sacker in behind Sigan Yix
[186.36 - 188.36] P:1482.32 E:0.098923 |  who is
[188.44 - 194.00] P:1512.58 E:0.112719 |  Making his 59th consecutive appearance for the Latvian national side tonight
[194.52 - 196.52] P:1549.57 E:0.081161 |  which actually is
[196.64 - 198.64] P:1739.48 E:0.099289 |  A joint record
[199.08 - 204.14] P:1702.01 E:0.095827 |  So it's in a ground which is a three-minute drive from his childhood home
[204.52 - 208.48] P:1643.88 E:0.095820 |  And he equals the record also set by Andres Rubins
[209.52 - 211.20] P:1463.50 E:0.115891 |  between
[211.20 - 213.20] P:1561.15 E:0.109099 |  1999 and 2004
[213.84 - 216.36] P:1598.25 E:0.095377 |  However, if he picks up a yellow card tonight
[216.68 - 223.92] P:1711.65 E:0.101301 |  He will not be able to extend that record because he's one of seven players if they pick up a yellow card would be suspended for their
[224.32 - 227.68] P:1746.33 E:0.097821 |  Final qualification game, which is a way to serve yet next month
[228.04 - 230.16] P:1716.82 E:0.104635 |  So he'll need to be on his best behavior Rogers
[230.16 - 233.28] P:1690.52 E:0.093438 |  That was a nice turn and he looked for the ball through the middle for Gordon
[233.36 - 240.56] P:1727.90 E:0.107217 |  He does that well doing Morgan Rogers really love the way he takes the ball and turns all in one motion
[240.96 - 243.16] P:1781.54 E:0.116045 |  You've got to have such good head movement to do that
[243.16 - 245.92] P:1717.36 E:0.106723 |  He checks and scans constantly before the ball comes
[245.92 - 249.76] P:1687.42 E:0.098331 |  He knows his surroundings and he's so smooth the way he takes that first touch
[249.80 - 255.24] P:1715.27 E:0.103064 |  Really does have an impact because he gets his head up and he's straight at the back for certainly when you know
[255.24 - 261.48] P:1678.48 E:0.091747 |  Both those banks of midfield and the defensive Latvia is so condensed. I enjoyed the the pre-match chat with
[263.40 - 268.76] P:1717.50 E:0.099734 |  Kelly and Connor and yourself but when Connor was highlighting Morgan Rogers, I couldn't agree more with him
[268.76 - 271.92] P:1654.51 E:0.084331 |  You know, we expecting Bellingham, but it says everything about
[273.24 - 275.24] P:1848.71 E:0.088218 |  Morgan Rogers, you know
[275.96 - 282.40] P:1714.91 E:0.100651 |  In the space of 11 months he's been involved in every game for England 10 successive games now where he's been involved
[282.76 - 285.04] P:1769.10 E:0.099738 |  Whether he's come off the bench or started
[285.52 - 291.36] P:1698.29 E:0.099568 |  And I think that Thomas Tuchel is a huge huge admirer of the Aston Villa player as the ball is
[291.60 - 295.08] P:1814.10 E:0.109053 |  Chipped out towards this near side. They were looking for
[296.28 - 299.52] P:1911.07 E:0.095098 |  Ytowskis down the line it goes looking to give chase
[300.04 - 302.04] P:1782.02 E:0.100524 |  Was that was batman? They've made three
[302.84 - 308.04] P:1825.82 E:0.103924 |  Changes from the side that drew 2-2 with Andorra on Saturday as Vedris is in goal
[308.60 - 310.60] P:1793.03 E:0.083238 |  you've got Vykes
[311.44 - 315.56] P:1808.88 E:0.101069 |  Tchernomordis and Balodis as their three central defenders Siganyik's and
[316.68 - 318.16] P:1776.80 E:0.105179 |  Ytowskis on the wing backs
[318.16 - 323.40] P:1861.14 E:0.097457 |  Vaslavans, Vapne, Zelenkovs in the centre of midfield with the Kanyiks just behind
[323.56 - 326.12] P:1813.55 E:0.079876 |  Goodkowskis who leads the line as
[326.84 - 328.84] P:1700.87 E:0.085702 |  Latvia are gonna do a
[329.00 - 331.64] P:1790.17 E:0.097790 |  Lot of defending in this game a lot of chasing
[332.28 - 337.80] P:1653.41 E:0.101517 |  Eventually you would think those legs would tire a sack of rolls it in towards Rogers with his back to go
[337.80 - 343.68] P:1680.57 E:0.100072 |  Couldn't roll away from his mark a sack of tries to win it back England go hunting for the ball over on that right hand side
[343.92 - 348.86] P:1723.88 E:0.103043 |  And in the end it was the Kanyiks is the player who's got a try and dig the ball out
[349.28 - 353.56] P:1754.74 E:0.095176 |  But England are all over them. They just can't get out that and the ball is played through here
[353.56 - 356.12] P:1779.11 E:0.103636 |  Is Rogers with a shot right foot it blocked on the edge of the area
[356.32 - 359.88] P:1697.45 E:0.095896 |  This is what Thomas Tuchel wants to see from his players
[359.88 - 365.52] P:1666.10 E:0.105814 |  I think certainly the regaining of possession once you lose it is a noticeable shift with England
[366.04 - 371.36] P:1562.12 E:0.099361 |  Their reaction three or four players nearest the ball really go after it for at least three to four seconds
[371.36 - 373.36] P:1598.97 E:0.093754 |  Just to see if they can win it straight back
[373.56 - 378.20] P:1508.85 E:0.097192 |  Makes it very hard for Latvia to get any passes out of that back area of the pitch. I mean
[378.92 - 382.92] P:1637.63 E:0.098771 |  It just about got away with it there and came through with the ball, but it's gonna be hard for them
[383.28 - 385.44] P:1612.15 E:0.098066 |  There's a poor result for them at home here wasn't it?
[385.44 - 390.80] P:1585.83 E:0.093091 |  It was a stand or a yeah, so the confidence wise me to concede two goals in that
[391.48 - 398.60] P:1652.56 E:0.093056 |  It's not great. No, England are attacking Saka weaves his way in towards the penalty area and the ball then is
[399.12 - 401.12] P:1746.67 E:0.083628 |  cleared away by
[402.32 - 406.68] P:1630.12 E:0.103266 |  Boss Slavons on the at the edge of the area it goes out for an England throw bizarrely
[406.76 - 409.88] P:1714.54 E:0.086756 |  That was the first time that they'd actually scored
[410.20 - 412.20] P:1646.44 E:0.079529 |  Two goals in a game
[413.76 - 415.36] P:1712.13 E:0.071321 |  under
[415.36 - 417.72] P:1628.90 E:0.103812 |  Paulo Nicolao their Italian coach
[418.76 - 421.20] P:1565.62 E:0.102346 |  First time in 17 games that they'd scored
[422.40 - 425.16] P:1752.71 E:0.098293 |  Two goals and it came against the might of Andorra
[426.40 - 432.12] P:1673.04 E:0.101405 |  This fence for England midway through the Latvian half England fans of boisterous
[432.72 - 434.72] P:1762.15 E:0.107207 |  Gonna damp cold
[434.76 - 438.00] P:1666.16 E:0.109724 |  Day in Riga as Gordon head the ball towards
[438.48 - 443.16] P:1729.51 E:0.113574 |  Lewis Skelly and then the ball is gonna be brought away by
[444.20 - 447.56] P:1731.86 E:0.099208 |  Latvia on this near side that the ball from
[448.36 - 451.52] P:1735.57 E:0.107197 |  Boss Slavons couldn't get it in field now Harry Kane picks it up
[451.56 - 458.24] P:1751.50 E:0.098245 |  He's got Gordon on his left hand side Gordon towards the penalty area crosses and Harry Kane puts it wide and I've got to say
[458.84 - 462.96] P:1782.81 E:0.097110 |  Harry Kane those sort of type of chances you would think he would bury
[463.56 - 466.92] P:1709.86 E:0.110663 |  Well, I think any chance you expect him to bury that's the kind of form he's in
[467.52 - 470.24] P:1686.22 E:0.103618 |  Didn't hit the target that time those good play from Gordon
[470.24 - 477.52] P:1745.06 E:0.093758 |  It really was he kind of fell to Kane had a little bit of space drove at the back for slipped it wide to Gordon makes his run into the box and
[478.12 - 480.12] P:1742.40 E:0.092452 |  for me just looking at the replay
[481.04 - 487.68] P:1567.53 E:0.100257 |  Certainly achievable for him to hit the target and he kind of looks up to the sky almost thinking Alva missed that it really was
[488.24 - 491.36] P:1648.67 E:0.100529 |  Aside for into the back of the net and Thomas Tuchel's reaction as well
[492.16 - 493.56] P:1478.14 E:0.096388 |  Certainly says that
[493.56 - 500.24] P:1721.58 E:0.101034 |  Was one of real shock on the face of the Thomas Tuchel for Harry Kane who scored 19 goals in
[500.64 - 504.00] P:1740.26 E:0.105414 |  12 games for club and country this season
[504.44 - 506.48] P:1732.88 E:0.127071 |  He's already had an early goal this allowed
[506.48 - 510.00] P:1485.67 E:0.098239 |  He could easily have put England ahead inside the seventh minute
[510.12 - 515.68] P:1766.94 E:0.107882 |  Bearing in mind England had to wait until the 38th minute to break the deadlock against Latvia back in March
[515.68 - 519.12] P:1838.36 E:0.109744 |  But all of a sudden the ball a heisted towards the penalty area
[519.52 - 522.16] P:1796.22 E:0.111979 |  The cost is couldn't control it in comes the cross
[522.48 - 526.44] P:1811.98 E:0.090670 |  He was excited there from the Latvian support as in front of us
[526.44 - 527.36] P:1814.65 E:0.080916 |  There's a
[527.36 - 532.40] P:1854.94 E:0.096047 |  Shriek as that cross came in from Yakov skis on this near side the right
[532.76 - 536.24] P:1769.74 E:0.090553 |  But in the end there was no real threat to Jordan Pickford scores
[536.24 - 542.28] P:1748.06 E:0.087702 |  He looks to extend his own record of eight successive clean sheets as a good header from stones defensively
[542.28 - 546.32] P:1690.72 E:0.092279 |  It was a great ball in wasn't it from Yakov skis really whipped it with a bit of pace, but
[546.92 - 549.16] P:1747.76 E:0.094495 |  Stones was in a great position just to flick it away
[550.80 - 557.60] P:1759.61 E:0.092439 |  Lewis Kelly goes down the line Gordon and with a second time for England that he's had three successive starts
[558.48 - 560.68] P:1705.02 E:0.099302 |  The last was 13 months ago
[560.68 - 562.64] P:1735.84 E:0.094100 |  He's never gone for on the spin for England
[562.64 - 568.32] P:1726.48 E:0.092859 |  But he's got a chance to impress as the Newcastle play it left hand side of the penalty area center in the left footed cross
[568.32 - 575.24] P:1797.90 E:0.089442 |  So Gagnik's heads it away drops towards Anderson tries to get it out towards Saka blocked comes out towards Spence
[575.48 - 582.86] P:1665.10 E:0.094129 |  He runs away and finds now the Arsenal player midway through the Latvian half nine minutes play BBC radio
[582.86 - 585.48] P:1691.04 E:0.104919 |  Five live also live on the BBC sounds out
[586.24 - 591.24] P:1725.31 E:0.099919 |  World Cup qualification game here and Lewis Kelly just took his eye off the ball
[591.24 - 594.16] P:1827.74 E:0.097960 |  It went away from him. It'll go out for a Latvia throw
[594.16 - 599.72] P:1668.45 E:0.089860 |  It's been a promising start as in it in a fixture that can be difficult in terms of just having to break down the team
[599.72 - 603.20] P:1631.95 E:0.094481 |  That's gonna sit deep but two good chances already. It should be one that up really
[603.20 - 609.66] P:1604.57 E:0.088786 |  I mean Harry Kane you would expect him to hit the target and Anthony Gordons look quite bright on the left hand side
[609.66 - 612.16] P:1417.02 E:0.097705 |  Putting a good couple of crosses into the box already
[614.60 - 621.32] P:1732.63 E:0.095794 |  Yacoscus is taking his time with the throw so a looping throw on this near side Latvia playing from
[621.92 - 627.76] P:1790.48 E:0.088560 |  Left to right as we look but England have it now and it was with Spence short ball push to the feet there of Saka
[627.76 - 629.76] P:1611.08 E:0.087668 |  Spence will go on the overlap and quickly
[630.40 - 632.40] P:1640.36 E:0.049424 |  that
[632.40 - 639.28] P:1705.64 E:0.092738 |  Pass from Saka fine Spence back to the Arsenal player here is concert bright orange boots on this damp night in the
[639.72 - 643.28] P:1549.46 E:0.105149 |  Latvian capital Gordon once again on the left comes on the inside
[644.08 - 646.60] P:1662.72 E:0.097585 |  about 25 yards out from goal and
[647.04 - 651.20] P:1607.41 E:0.106122 |  Anderson no width at the minute because sacchar had come just to the right corner of the box
[651.20 - 655.12] P:1734.74 E:0.098345 |  He had to move back outside and once again Spence goes on the overlap
[655.12 - 661.00] P:1725.52 E:0.097239 |  Here is Saka looks to try and thread the ball through blocked comes back to Saka shoots left-footed blocked
[661.00 - 664.84] P:1747.11 E:0.092143 |  It'll rebound out towards Spence his first time cross-texan deflection
[665.68 - 670.06] P:1717.92 E:0.122411 |  Also Lewis Skelly who tried to strike it wouldn't necessarily sit
[670.56 - 672.56] P:1757.91 E:0.092173 |  took out
[673.92 - 679.06] P:1651.28 E:0.112290 |  Boss 11 the Latvia midfielder in the process Saka though now has it his crosses a deep one
[679.36 - 687.44] P:1712.04 E:0.097496 |  And it's headed up in the air by Yacoscus and then the effort on the half volley is fired in by
[688.32 - 692.04] P:1613.17 E:0.109102 |  Elliot Anderson and it was right put it in screwed well over the top this
[693.20 - 694.92] P:1664.49 E:0.105682 |  Portugal nil
[694.92 - 696.92] P:1691.57 E:0.085063 |  Hungary won is
[698.08 - 704.28] P:1644.74 E:0.095256 |  The latest score in group F and that means that it's a setback for Portugal's hopes of
[705.52 - 711.56] P:1595.86 E:0.101974 |  Qualification tonight they had to win and hope that our main I mean you fail to win against the Republic of Ireland
[711.76 - 714.36] P:1361.20 E:0.099170 |  However, they're not even up holding their side of the bargain
[714.96 - 717.96] P:1698.77 E:0.081490 |  Because they have fallen behind Portugal nil
[718.48 - 723.14] P:1658.90 E:0.096852 |  Hungry one is a latest score Matt Upsett well at the moment this game is just feeling like
[723.80 - 729.28] P:1552.84 E:0.096793 |  You know when will England score not if doesn't it? I mean it's just got that feel to have started very well
[729.68 - 735.98] P:1664.84 E:0.094503 |  There's good movement off the ball which you have to have Jed Spence going on lots of overlaps to try and stretch the play Lewis
[735.98 - 737.76] P:1482.53 E:0.097604 |  Skelly getting supportive and
[737.80 - 743.24] P:1681.81 E:0.095686 |  You know England looking like any moment if they find the right pass or the right cross
[743.32 - 745.32] P:1596.47 E:0.088909 |  They're gonna put the ball in the back of the net
[745.44 - 748.28] P:1744.86 E:0.098378 |  Here is sir Louis Skelly coming in off the left touch line
[748.60 - 754.28] P:1791.87 E:0.100173 |  Gordon goes out to the to the touch line looks to go on the outside of Yacoscus delivers the cross as well
[754.28 - 759.76] P:1723.97 E:0.095495 |  So Gagnix is there to head it away inside the penalty area picked up though by Spence England
[759.76 - 764.84] P:1724.47 E:0.094804 |  They're still looking to try and keep the tempo keep the pressure on Latvia pass the ball out quickly
[765.04 - 768.24] P:1754.75 E:0.103290 |  Stones towards Gordon early ball into the penalty area and
[769.00 - 774.52] P:1728.96 E:0.101178 |  Try to be kept alive by Rogers, but it goes behind eventually for a goal kick
[774.96 - 778.32] P:1695.70 E:0.096025 |  They seem to have moved on you know when they played well
[779.00 - 784.08] P:1704.34 E:0.102716 |  Indeed Latvia and Andorra and there was them stodgy performances. Yes, they were passing the ball slowly
[784.08 - 786.08] P:1611.06 E:0.096422 |  They were struggling to break down teams with a low block
[786.32 - 792.44] P:1679.05 E:0.086883 |  They've now got an urgency about themselves and his last two and a bit cage. It's not stodgy is it definitely not at all
[792.48 - 796.72] P:1641.28 E:0.092419 |  It's quite sharp. It's bright. There's movement. I love the fact that Rogers and
[797.12 - 802.88] P:1498.61 E:0.100761 |  Or rice are always arriving in the box when the balls wide with a full back or with Gordon or Saka to cross it
[802.92 - 805.68] P:1551.08 E:0.101394 |  One of those is making that run right into the heart of the box
[805.84 - 808.60] P:1785.14 E:0.093652 |  Here is Harry Kane inside. He finds Rogers
[808.76 - 813.52] P:1692.46 E:0.096560 |  Saka is to his right edge of the penalty area enters the box now balls stuck to his left foot
[813.68 - 818.36] P:1743.84 E:0.099285 |  Clips it across towards Lewis Skelly sits up for Lewis Skelly hits it left-footed down into the ground
[818.40 - 824.80] P:1668.94 E:0.091860 |  And then in the end he plays the ball back towards concept in England and maintaining their dominance and their control in this game in
[824.88 - 828.52] P:1686.23 E:0.096623 |  13 minutes Spencer game will come on the overlap. They're looking for that sort of
[829.16 - 833.28] P:1714.40 E:0.098303 |  As it's Saka's cross comes shot sales over the goal and out for a goal kick
[833.40 - 837.96] P:1810.30 E:0.091339 |  They're wanting the full backs to be aggressive to get forward to be attacking
[838.96 - 844.20] P:1744.00 E:0.105244 |  And certainly Spencer's is doing that on the right-hand side is and when he does that
[844.20 - 848.60] P:1729.04 E:0.106381 |  He just takes that little bit of attention from the defender because the last thing you want to allow
[849.24 - 853.44] P:1678.86 E:0.114045 |  Saka do like we saw against Wales on Thursday has come inside on his left foot
[853.44 - 857.64] P:1621.33 E:0.091405 |  I mean his pinpoint the way he picks out the far post and whips it with his left foot
[857.64 - 861.08] P:1702.80 E:0.088637 |  So he's just trying to create that bit of confusion spent
[861.08 - 866.20] P:1692.60 E:0.097968 |  We're you know, I mean he might make ten of those runs and get the ball once but it just creates that half a yard for Saka
[867.12 - 872.82] P:1784.49 E:0.107473 |  To us to come this occasion did acknowledge the England supporters who filled the four segments of that
[873.18 - 878.18] P:1737.27 E:0.101760 |  Terras that is elevated away towards our right-hand side with a thumbs up as Harry Kane
[878.34 - 882.18] P:1513.70 E:0.102274 |  Nice little play by England Lewis Skelly. We talk about the full backs getting forward
[882.18 - 887.46] P:1631.43 E:0.098582 |  He was the most advanced England shirt there on the edge of the penalty area and they almost slipped him in too
[887.94 - 891.66] P:1560.04 E:0.100786 |  We always looks the likely to get in the box doesn't he every time he plays Lewis Skelly
[892.26 - 896.78] P:1611.77 E:0.095037 |  He's got that kind of confidence to go forward amazing confidence for such a young player
[897.78 - 904.26] P:1579.60 E:0.100238 |  Ball given away interception for Anderson here for England still 0-0 on five live and the BBC sounds out
[904.26 - 906.26] P:1544.24 E:0.091058 |  We've been playing for nearly a quarter of an hour
[907.98 - 912.46] P:1738.33 E:0.096527 |  This here now is Declan Rice Rice out towards Gordon
[913.62 - 916.82] P:1738.88 E:0.100428 |  Lewis Skelly first time cross swept over from the left
[917.10 - 923.02] P:1719.83 E:0.097880 |  But it goes out of play for a goal kick and more like football tomorrow on five live women's Champions League coverage
[923.46 - 930.10] P:1750.58 E:0.094752 |  Chelsea against Paris and the Premier League returns on Saturday five live sport from midday Manchester City against Everton
[930.46 - 934.94] P:1735.15 E:0.107605 |  The three o'clock commentary and the usual goal service full and Arsenal at 5 30
[935.18 - 940.86] P:1704.08 E:0.104499 |  Crystal Palace Bournemouth incidentally will be our sports extra offering at three and then on Sunday
[940.86 - 945.38] P:1761.26 E:0.104735 |  Tottenham Aston Villa at two and Liverpool Manchester United the small matter of
[945.98 - 951.74] P:1664.84 E:0.091994 |  The commentary at half past four so there the games look forward to as the Premier League returns
[952.50 - 957.74] P:1632.94 E:0.091394 |  This is a World Cup qualifier where it remains Latvia nil England nil
[958.34 - 960.68] P:1834.54 E:0.096659 |  John Stones strokes it in field
[961.26 - 962.22] P:1564.93 E:0.084864 |  concert
[962.22 - 964.22] P:1666.48 E:0.109668 |  Two out to his right-hand side
[964.74 - 968.18] P:1692.14 E:0.103567 |  Spence again on the overlap Saka plays him in sliding across
[969.82 - 973.66] P:1802.45 E:0.097319 |  This ball odys and it will go out for an England throw that they take quickly
[975.62 - 977.62] P:1617.41 E:0.081467 |  And it's Saka
[977.98 - 979.34] P:1736.96 E:0.072593 |  concert
[979.34 - 981.34] P:1745.82 E:0.094379 |  Stones now as well
[981.74 - 986.50] P:1674.10 E:0.095802 |  Ball reaches Gordon on this near side comes in field hits it curling
[986.90 - 991.96] P:1675.99 E:0.105846 |  And he's got too much underneath that it was always going over the top and it runs away off the athletics track
[992.10 - 996.98] P:1742.56 E:0.099319 |  And goes right up against the metal fence underneath that elevated stand
[998.22 - 999.22] P:1719.05 E:0.082462 |  Left hand side
[999.22 - 1006.10] P:1609.26 E:0.097947 |  It's been another good start from Elliott Anderson in this game. He's got such a good instinct of reading
[1006.82 - 1013.90] P:1616.18 E:0.099854 |  Where to be to pick up a loose parcel to apply pressure to someone's first touch he really I don't know whether
[1013.90 - 1016.10] P:1645.55 E:0.097691 |  That's just a natural sense that he has but
[1016.30 - 1020.18] P:1576.00 E:0.102903 |  It's certainly a great asset to have in the middle of pitch and again makes it
[1020.46 - 1026.78] P:1452.02 E:0.092151 |  That little bit harder to find a place in that midfield for any players coming in because he's just dominating that part of pitch at the moment
[1026.78 - 1031.30] P:1696.10 E:0.102219 |  Anderson plays it to Saka Saka chips over the cross from the right Latvia will try
[1031.98 - 1035.14] P:1843.80 E:0.107261 |  And it was a foul by Lewis Skelly
[1035.86 - 1041.58] P:1775.78 E:0.092866 |  And that will be a free kick to Latvia. It was on boss slavums
[1042.62 - 1044.62] P:1733.95 E:0.076514 |  who
[1045.54 - 1051.42] P:1730.28 E:0.100820 |  Played now in 14 of the last 16 internationals for Latvia
[1052.18 - 1056.58] P:1729.10 E:0.097065 |  Just an accidental trip and it'll offer a little bit of respite because it's been a
[1057.46 - 1061.26] P:1751.99 E:0.100815 |  Difficult 17 minutes hasn't it for Latvia to try and keep England at bay
[1062.26 - 1064.74] P:1689.52 E:0.092168 |  Can't be too much fun. Can it just running around
[1065.62 - 1069.50] P:1638.42 E:0.096358 |  Dropping in filling in tracking back making tackles and when you get the ball
[1070.26 - 1072.82] P:1603.51 E:0.093530 |  They're not managing to keep possession at all
[1072.82 - 1075.30] P:1654.13 E:0.102321 |  They've got a little bit of the ball back right now at the left back position
[1075.30 - 1080.90] P:1616.81 E:0.100633 |  But look at the pressure from England everyone all the white shirts pushed all the way in not allowing any space and just forced the error
[1081.10 - 1084.30] P:1578.69 E:0.089388 |  the ball out of play and then they're locking into players again. It's a really
[1085.30 - 1087.30] P:1532.23 E:0.090720 |  Discipline start from England
[1087.66 - 1095.18] P:1759.20 E:0.105146 |  Daniels Bologna's who was relegated with with st. Johnston is actually left Scotland now and moved to Slovakia in the in the summer
[1095.38 - 1099.78] P:1769.61 E:0.094348 |  Was the player who was able to clear it comes to this near side for Yakovsky's
[1100.14 - 1106.46] P:1666.37 E:0.097488 |  Declan Reiser wins it back for England as Jordan Tickford comes into my eye line all in green
[1106.90 - 1112.64] P:1747.01 E:0.093190 |  Still to be as vocal just for him to keep that levels of concentration just to shout to the players
[1112.64 - 1114.64] P:1604.14 E:0.088774 |  That's how he maintains his
[1115.36 - 1119.64] P:1688.21 E:0.094650 |  Concentration and he's gonna be a mere spectator tonight just a question of winning in score
[1119.64 - 1122.16] P:1668.49 E:0.095396 |  When can they break down this lap the inside nil nil?
[1122.52 - 1125.92] P:1640.74 E:0.092111 |  Spence Anderson got time to have a little glance over his left shoulder
[1126.56 - 1130.56] P:1645.46 E:0.092492 |  18 minutes play looks very very comfortable load as Anderson always makes himself available
[1130.56 - 1135.08] P:1776.18 E:0.103024 |  Spence gives it away picked up now by the low striker because this
[1136.24 - 1142.40] P:1711.78 E:0.093232 |  And he is fouled and that will be a free kick as Turkey are leading Georgia by a goal to nil
[1142.64 - 1143.64] P:1606.39 E:0.067179 |  in
[1143.64 - 1145.24] P:1687.94 E:0.069202 |  group E
[1145.24 - 1146.72] P:1647.25 E:0.071897 |  Turkey won
[1146.72 - 1148.04] P:1740.89 E:0.082055 |  Georgia nil
[1148.04 - 1151.92] P:1734.99 E:0.084497 |  Turkey trying to keep pace with Spain at the top of Group E
[1152.48 - 1153.88] P:1518.08 E:0.064922 |  as
[1153.88 - 1156.46] P:1677.26 E:0.101982 |  Latvia go back to their goalkeepers Vedris
[1157.32 - 1164.12] P:1726.84 E:0.100999 |  Intercepted though by Declan Rice here is Anthony Gordon moving into a central area the layoff by Rogers almost got
[1164.56 - 1168.32] P:1755.00 E:0.107831 |  Harry Kane in but straight away Rogers goes in pursuit of the ball
[1168.32 - 1173.60] P:1796.45 E:0.093594 |  He doesn't think all didn't quite come off his first instinct is there to go chase after the Latvian defense
[1173.72 - 1180.12] P:1656.29 E:0.105646 |  That's the reaction you want the reaction Thomas Tuchels looking for it was it nice layoff as well tough to get the perfect angle
[1180.12 - 1184.32] P:1675.99 E:0.109999 |  Wasn't it came into it really just try to cushion it one touch into the path of Kane
[1184.32 - 1188.80] P:1694.05 E:0.107315 |  But you're right the reaction was super to go and press and force the error to win the ball back
[1189.60 - 1196.36] P:1731.26 E:0.111267 |  Anderson again doing the the industry the hard work in the midfield and then wanting the ball off Jordan pick
[1196.84 - 1198.84] P:1859.54 E:0.095056 |  As concert
[1198.88 - 1203.64] P:1820.21 E:0.110393 |  Comes to the midway point of his own half and takes it short from from pickford
[1204.20 - 1210.60] P:1746.23 E:0.108497 |  As we hear Latvian voices for the first time here in Riga tonight that Gordon goes on the outside down towards the byline
[1211.24 - 1214.60] P:1771.71 E:0.101909 |  Gordon keeps the ball in play and pulls it back sack of shoots blocks
[1216.24 - 1221.08] P:1614.46 E:0.107571 |  But the back in the back the flag is up on the far side. He had actually gone out anyway
[1221.48 - 1224.92] P:1693.53 E:0.116012 |  It'll be a goal kick to where to lack of a Gordon looks lively
[1224.92 - 1230.56] P:1693.33 E:0.098990 |  He does is going out of defender every time goes past him rides a second challenge
[1230.96 - 1233.80] P:1675.39 E:0.102479 |  Just doesn't manage to keep the ball in as he crosses it
[1233.80 - 1236.88] P:1535.18 E:0.097197 |  But he's looked to be very direct Anthony Gordon
[1236.88 - 1238.88] P:1567.46 E:0.109338 |  He's not had a brilliant season in terms of
[1239.40 - 1246.96] P:1650.16 E:0.104526 |  Impact numbers of goals and assists has he for new cars certainly not in the Premier League is not really carrying too much punch in terms of
[1247.36 - 1249.36] P:1664.79 E:0.104190 |  defining moments in matches, but
[1249.56 - 1251.46] P:1569.39 E:0.109957 |  You just always know what you get from him
[1251.46 - 1258.64] P:1637.98 E:0.103187 |  Don't know his application of work rate and attitude is spot-on which always does create that foundation for you as a player
[1260.56 - 1264.08] P:1569.43 E:0.112881 |  I was given a score by our producer Gary. I thought I remembered it
[1266.40 - 1269.32] P:1536.68 E:0.108253 |  I rolled it up the score and sent over the cross and then
[1269.60 - 1276.76] P:1468.91 E:0.101966 |  I've had to unravel it because I actually forgotten what it was and it's and Dora are leading Serbia by a goal to nail in England's group
[1277.16 - 1279.16] P:1594.40 E:0.102522 |  That gives you an indication of how much
[1279.76 - 1285.50] P:1448.51 E:0.103747 |  Serbia in disarray and Dora leading 1-0 Dora flying like two goals away from home
[1285.50 - 1288.36] P:1398.65 E:0.107347 |  Oh, yeah now a homie Serbia one
[1289.40 - 1295.12] P:1536.52 E:0.098597 |  That was their their first point in group K as well. I can't believe you screwed that result up
[1296.44 - 1298.92] P:1502.04 E:0.102840 |  The memories not what it used to be
[1300.60 - 1305.70] P:1464.92 E:0.101561 |  There's a mountain of paper now starts to just gather in the desk between you and me Matt
[1306.76 - 1308.76] P:1445.61 E:0.102558 |  21 minutes play mill mill
[1309.12 - 1311.72] P:1492.26 E:0.106716 |  It was actually Serbia's inability
[1312.48 - 1317.76] P:1462.86 E:0.102942 |  To to beat Albania that defeats that meant that the three points could secure
[1318.08 - 1320.92] P:1437.91 E:0.101730 |  qualification for the World Cup for England tonight with those
[1321.44 - 1327.32] P:1388.19 E:0.103933 |  Games that were played on Saturday England of course have played two days previously without friendly against Wales as Anderson
[1327.68 - 1332.16] P:1430.07 E:0.109675 |  Thomas Tuchel desperate for Spence to get forward looks for the cross for Harry Kane
[1332.92 - 1334.92] P:1585.83 E:0.105399 |  It was
[1334.92 - 1339.92] P:1462.15 E:0.109496 |  The captain was headed behind the lead by the way didn't last long
[1339.92 - 1345.12] P:1381.40 E:0.102636 |  I can rip that one up with confidence as Serbia have equalized and Dora one
[1345.52 - 1348.72] P:1435.37 E:0.099351 |  Serbia one elsewhere in group K England
[1348.72 - 1352.40] P:1456.39 E:0.100260 |  They'll have a corner kick and Declan Rice is going to take it
[1352.40 - 1358.32] P:1387.02 E:0.103720 |  This is big as well for me having a team because you don't get a lot of time to work together on an international stage
[1358.32 - 1363.56] P:1284.16 E:0.100305 |  But having good set pieces when you come into a major tournament is is massive
[1363.80 - 1368.24] P:1430.30 E:0.102940 |  So England working on that and having a plan which they have is being tresting see how this corner takes out
[1368.24 - 1372.20] P:1352.05 E:0.107796 |  Declan Rice with his right foot Declan Rice swings it over from that far side the right
[1372.36 - 1378.76] P:1500.31 E:0.096800 |  Flicks away by the head of Jordan Moody's picked back up by Anderson and now it is with that with stones
[1379.40 - 1384.76] P:1449.92 E:0.111131 |  And stones will run in field. He'll pass the ball back out towards Rice and stayed right corner the area
[1384.80 - 1387.68] P:1216.99 E:0.097928 |  Saccharis behind him Spence is central at the moment
[1387.68 - 1392.20] P:1417.84 E:0.098254 |  This is Morgan Rogers Rogers delivers the cross and Latvia defense deal with it
[1392.20 - 1396.92] P:1449.65 E:0.105149 |  So we'll be way through the first half it is goal is here on five live and to take you through the half time
[1396.92 - 1401.92] P:1425.62 E:0.106366 |  It's that correspondent John. Thank you Ian. Yes. It's good a real FA cup field to it
[1402.16 - 1407.08] P:1559.89 E:0.090874 |  This match here in this setting in the capital of Latvia
[1407.52 - 1414.16] P:1440.78 E:0.107177 |  Riga the Dalgava stadium, which is named after the the wide river that flows through the city
[1414.28 - 1418.12] P:1468.49 E:0.100546 |  As England attack Spencer's cross from the right-hand side say England attack
[1418.12 - 1424.80] P:1449.65 E:0.092700 |  That's all that's happened during the match so far. It's a tag against defense and here is Gordon now Anthony Gordon
[1424.80 - 1431.48] P:1556.30 E:0.097164 |  Gives it to Harry Kane the captain fit again after his bruised foot then Miles Lewis Scully turns tries to give it back to
[1431.48 - 1432.96] P:1362.97 E:0.102842 |  Kane but there are too many
[1432.96 - 1440.32] P:1478.70 E:0.108310 |  Maroon and orange shirts inside the Latvia penalty area and in the end actually England winner for a cake Anderson's bundled over
[1440.52 - 1444.28] P:1388.93 E:0.107131 |  Gordon now plays it infield Kane 30 yards out plays it square
[1444.64 - 1449.20] P:1470.17 E:0.102312 |  Spencer's there now out to Sacher on the right-hand side and the green boots after he scored
[1449.40 - 1455.80] P:1464.24 E:0.102488 |  One of the goals on Thursday night is first since the Euro Sacher and then into the edge of the penalty area
[1455.92 - 1458.50] P:1474.06 E:0.106062 |  Half cleared away comes back Elliot Anderson
[1458.50 - 1464.68] P:1398.47 E:0.099050 |  Elliot Anderson now Lewis Scully his left foot across right across the penalty area and then it's bounced down and
[1465.04 - 1468.96] P:1450.48 E:0.097789 |  and should be dealt with by C Gannick's but he hasn't
[1469.80 - 1474.12] P:1381.36 E:0.093301 |  Done that and it's actually had us play open for a throwing to England relentless man
[1474.12 - 1477.60] P:1505.30 E:0.102471 |  It is relentless and Thomas Tuchel right at the edge of his technical area
[1477.60 - 1482.12] P:1414.72 E:0.102746 |  I can tell he's getting a little bit edgy in terms of England have really controlled in this game
[1482.12 - 1485.00] P:1307.29 E:0.104658 |  But they've not made that breakthrough yet, and I think he's feeling a little bit
[1485.48 - 1490.88] P:1358.96 E:0.092150 |  Just anxious as if to say if he feels his team maybe should have one goal
[1492.04 - 1496.68] P:1387.34 E:0.098497 |  Already, but they haven't and they've just got to keep probing keep working keep trying to break down
[1497.44 - 1499.44] P:1356.40 E:0.101261 |  This Latvia team that are just sat
[1500.36 - 1504.92] P:1313.73 E:0.100741 |  Right back and they're saying come on then break us down Matthew Upton with us on 5-5
[1505.08 - 1508.92] P:1494.14 E:0.099980 |  Went to the World Cup with England Connor Cody's in the studio with Kelly Kates
[1508.92 - 1513.12] P:1332.31 E:0.103128 |  We'll hear from Conor at halftime another England World Cup man as Anthony Gordon
[1513.68 - 1519.24] P:1400.33 E:0.106480 |  Christ to win a corner for England, but it bounced back onto him and behind for a goal kick
[1519.24 - 1523.48] P:1446.00 E:0.104263 |  Yes, I'm not sure how Harry Kane missed that chance that he had when it was
[1524.28 - 1527.32] P:1409.73 E:0.103679 |  Swept in from the left-hand side by Anthony Gordon
[1527.92 - 1533.92] P:1420.53 E:0.097976 |  The contact was as clean as can be but it was inches wide at the foot of the post very uncained like
[1533.92 - 1536.80] P:1257.88 E:0.100565 |  Doesn't it I have to say those are normally
[1537.60 - 1543.88] P:1334.15 E:0.093251 |  Absolute precision. Yeah, and he just gets it wrong hits it through the near post. Maybe gets hits it too clean John
[1543.88 - 1546.84] P:1243.56 E:0.075652 |  Yeah, Harry Kane missed the match on Thursday
[1546.84 - 1553.28] P:1524.39 E:0.095205 |  That was the first match the only match that he's not started under the management of Thomas Tuchel this to calls eight
[1553.48 - 1558.40] P:1531.81 E:0.101550 |  Match in charge Portugal have equalised against Hungary. It's Cristiano Ronaldo with his
[1559.52 - 1565.00] P:1573.72 E:0.102996 |  142nd international goal and Turkey now to nail up on Georgia in the
[1565.52 - 1572.12] P:1430.76 E:0.089859 |  In the Spain group still Spain mill Bulgaria nil and here is one for Gordon
[1572.12 - 1578.68] P:1634.23 E:0.097222 |  It's a longer past this time Latria did actually venture downfield so Gordon now there's a little bit of space cuts in field right for charges
[1580.16 - 1583.36] P:1549.87 E:0.105916 |  Anthony Gordon opens the scoring for England
[1583.48 - 1586.80] P:1591.40 E:0.097831 |  In the 26th minute and the Latvian
[1587.24 - 1594.24] P:1652.43 E:0.102166 |  Resistance is broken by the Newcastle United man who scores his second goal for England nicely done as well
[1594.60 - 1600.20] P:1539.07 E:0.104123 |  On his right foot a law shot into the far bottom corner, and it is Latvia near England one
[1600.72 - 1603.84] P:1493.30 E:0.102629 |  He deserves that Anthony Gordon for how he started the game
[1604.32 - 1611.80] P:1551.21 E:0.099302 |  He's been really positive and progressive and he gets his reward after say though John Stones plays a huge part in this goal
[1612.16 - 1617.00] P:1461.96 E:0.090884 |  He literally gets the ball and he points his finger and looks at Gordon and says go on
[1617.00 - 1621.12] P:1611.05 E:0.092267 |  Just go in behind but we can keep playing into feet and having to break him down you get behind
[1621.12 - 1627.80] P:1511.51 E:0.088805 |  He chips the ball over the top lovely ball Gordon skips onto it drops his shoulder cuts in past two defenders
[1627.80 - 1629.80] P:1568.81 E:0.088782 |  And it's just a lovely placed
[1630.40 - 1634.28] P:1251.77 E:0.101600 |  precise side foot where he bends the ball with his right foot
[1634.80 - 1640.44] P:1402.38 E:0.106358 |  Curling around the goalkeeper into the far post perfect finish lovely move from England simple
[1640.48 - 1643.92] P:1347.69 E:0.096727 |  There's been lots of intricate little bits of play that was really simple
[1643.92 - 1646.36] P:1277.68 E:0.097933 |  But straight to the point and they get their reward
[1646.60 - 1652.84] P:1567.02 E:0.097683 |  But that was one of the few occasions where England Stones was able to play a pass like that because I said
[1652.84 - 1655.32] P:1393.92 E:0.109644 |  I had ventured downfield. Yes, that's right
[1655.32 - 1658.16] P:1275.46 E:0.100344 |  That attack concert cuts it out the ball pops to stones
[1658.48 - 1663.92] P:1436.45 E:0.106641 |  But you know we talked about how influential he is and the Conocoady mentioned it before the game about what he brings
[1664.08 - 1668.36] P:1357.02 E:0.108902 |  That was just real leadership if I'm honest because he's got the ball at his feet
[1668.40 - 1671.52] P:1191.10 E:0.104484 |  He wants to put it in there and he puts his finger up and looks
[1671.68 - 1678.76] P:1326.49 E:0.103906 |  Gordon in the eye across the pitch and says to get yourself in behind and he's got the quality to find the right way to pass and Anthony Gordon
[1679.28 - 1682.40] P:1435.40 E:0.097073 |  Finished it brilliantly he started very well on this left-hand side for England
[1682.40 - 1685.68] P:1517.91 E:0.110991 |  Yes, he did. I thought he played well against Wales as well on Thursday night
[1685.68 - 1688.80] P:1604.40 E:0.109872 |  And he's had a little bit of a wait for his second England goal, but there it is
[1688.80 - 1693.96] P:1529.35 E:0.097354 |  It's come as Latvia do push forward with your Koskis on the right-hand side
[1694.12 - 1699.80] P:1510.50 E:0.089952 |  Gets the cross into the box and that's cleared away by John Stones on the volley and it bounces out of play just down in front of us
[1699.80 - 1701.92] P:1436.80 E:0.101767 |  We've got a running track around the pitch here
[1701.92 - 1708.44] P:1589.29 E:0.097418 |  But it is wide open this stadium and actually the forecast was for very strong winds tonight blowing in off the Baltic
[1708.60 - 1713.32] P:1426.26 E:0.105866 |  Just like they had here against Andorra on Saturday when the match finished 2-2
[1713.40 - 1718.16] P:1443.17 E:0.098385 |  And they had to scrap the plans to have an arch on the field before the match because they thought it was going to blow away
[1718.44 - 1721.56] P:1419.16 E:0.097479 |  But the the strong winds haven't
[1722.28 - 1727.68] P:1479.88 E:0.106063 |  Realized forecast wrong John and you actually forced me to pop into a shop and buy a willy hat this afternoon
[1728.00 - 1731.36] P:1502.02 E:0.110873 |  Yes, that was 20 euros wasted a little serve you well though
[1731.36 - 1735.68] P:1601.42 E:0.102068 |  Here's your Koskis down the right-hand side plays the ball in and bounces up and onto
[1736.20 - 1741.40] P:1560.21 E:0.086445 |  Konza and England are able to clear it away vast slavans in the penalty area
[1741.80 - 1746.36] P:1508.12 E:0.082322 |  Got contact on that but I think down into the ground up onto Konza and England clear
[1746.36 - 1751.36] P:1553.78 E:0.098220 |  There's a handball appeal as well off of Konza who had his arms down by his side
[1751.36 - 1757.12] P:1461.95 E:0.098675 |  But like we've seen in these competitions in European or international football
[1757.60 - 1759.92] P:1569.63 E:0.106500 |  They do like a dodgy handball decision
[1759.92 - 1761.80] P:1453.17 E:0.097794 |  But I don't think anything's come of it
[1761.80 - 1767.16] P:1556.48 E:0.099984 |  But nice move from that. We actually good ball in a good good runners into the box. They actually committed men forwards
[1767.16 - 1769.16] P:1454.83 E:0.090108 |  Yeah, they did and
[1769.40 - 1771.16] P:1216.34 E:0.117068 |  you know this
[1771.16 - 1777.96] P:1350.68 E:0.101631 |  It had to be an improvement after what happened here on Saturday when a great deal went wrong for
[1778.60 - 1780.60] P:1256.25 E:0.093377 |  Latvia
[1780.84 - 1782.44] P:1420.67 E:0.120647 |  Their coach
[1782.44 - 1785.20] P:1540.40 E:0.111687 |  Paolo Nicolato was saying to us yesterday
[1785.20 - 1791.16] P:1403.94 E:0.102175 |  He said there are you said there are lovely lovely group of players. They said they're nice lads. Actually, they're too nice
[1791.28 - 1795.48] P:1274.91 E:0.104509 |  I'd like them to be to be bad guys against England tonight
[1795.96 - 1798.08] P:1391.58 E:0.105454 |  Well, they've got a corner after that
[1798.08 - 1801.88] P:1350.21 E:0.102838 |  So it's their first corner of the match and there's lots of movement in the box
[1801.88 - 1807.92] P:1355.69 E:0.101429 |  Here it is delivered at the near post and it's headed away by Harry Kane for England and then Saka stretch and got a touch to it
[1807.92 - 1813.36] P:1369.90 E:0.109224 |  But it's out of play and Latvia having their best spell of the match the backdrop though. You can hear it
[1814.56 - 1816.56] P:1441.62 E:0.097733 |  2700 England fans are in that
[1817.32 - 1822.04] P:1311.03 E:0.104619 |  stand to our right which is all alone there in
[1822.28 - 1828.04] P:1427.65 E:0.098990 |  In splendid isolation these two stands that are sort of raised up above the ground probably
[1828.92 - 1834.88] P:1469.13 E:0.094374 |  1015 feet by concrete tellers and the England fans are in there in great numbers here and
[1835.40 - 1842.22] P:1534.38 E:0.095552 |  And they'll be enjoying the England performance so far tonight the goal from Anthony Gordon and I'm sure they'll have enjoyed their time in this
[1842.76 - 1849.44] P:1495.26 E:0.094680 |  Really attractive city that we find ourselves first time. I've been here for over a quarter of a century
[1849.44 - 1854.36] P:1301.83 E:0.091357 |  I've forgotten how nice it is and beautiful in autumn as well and Latvia
[1855.00 - 1857.96] P:1464.63 E:0.089835 |  With the boys the Lenkovs plays it up to it
[1857.96 - 1860.80] P:1533.57 E:0.096704 |  It can't it's who is trying to take it around the outside
[1860.92 - 1866.84] P:1502.96 E:0.097845 |  But Jed Spencer's able to get the ball from it going out and then that was a that was a sturdy challenge
[1867.12 - 1870.92] P:1485.44 E:0.090637 |  From a Tigan Yix actually on him and he just knocked the ball away
[1870.92 - 1876.18] P:1573.53 E:0.087500 |  It's he can't it's dive day in court spends and we'll just have to see if he's okay. I think he's gonna be okay
[1876.58 - 1879.72] P:1247.89 E:0.085666 |  Well, he's the exact play that didn't need a book in today's den
[1879.72 - 1884.04] P:1443.59 E:0.091062 |  I was already mentioned earlier on he was on for a record wasn't he he's got a bit he must have been yellow card
[1884.04 - 1888.56] P:1551.04 E:0.097788 |  It's that yeah, you got the yellow card straight out. Yeah, yeah, it was out too quick John
[1888.56 - 1890.56] P:1422.23 E:0.088132 |  I think the yellow car was out before
[1891.22 - 1893.22] P:1321.37 E:0.076756 |  The player had hit the ground
[1893.26 - 1899.30] P:1351.99 E:0.102271 |  I mean, it was a bad tackle. He really does launch in catches him quite badly and it's a shame because
[1900.02 - 1903.98] P:1252.37 E:0.098547 |  That record he was going for he won't be able to achieve now. No, well, he's equal bit
[1903.98 - 1908.18] P:1325.90 E:0.096260 |  It's a Latvia record for consecutive appearances
[1909.10 - 1916.12] P:1374.54 E:0.099801 |  For the the men's international team 59 matches, but as Ian pointed out earlier, he will not be able to play
[1917.30 - 1920.58] P:1320.20 E:0.089703 |  against Serbia away next month in
[1921.94 - 1926.06] P:1493.42 E:0.102833 |  What will be their final qualifier so England leading by one goal to nil
[1926.06 - 1930.18] P:1352.79 E:0.096500 |  This is the scoreline that will confirm England's place at the World Cup
[1930.90 - 1936.94] P:1444.39 E:0.101176 |  Next summer but only one nil and Latvia have been much better since they conceded the goals strangely
[1937.02 - 1944.46] P:1481.21 E:0.094926 |  They've had to try and come out and here they are now in possession again on the halfway line the maroon and white colors
[1944.46 - 1945.78] P:1429.46 E:0.114581 |  of the
[1945.78 - 1950.26] P:1672.84 E:0.099792 |  Latvia national flag as well as bits of orange in there as well in England all in
[1950.54 - 1958.30] P:1553.79 E:0.080027 |  Pristine white tonight really standing out on this dank damp evening here just outside the
[1959.30 - 1964.12] P:1407.54 E:0.085950 |  The Riga city centre must have the pitch looks good though John it does yeah the balls
[1964.62 - 1970.78] P:1466.07 E:0.084874 |  Both teams no issues with the pitch at all. No dodgy bounces. It's actually being moved nice and quickly and
[1971.22 - 1978.42] P:1355.03 E:0.085200 |  Pretty flush along the surface. See it is the national athletics stadium of Latvia as well as

[2034.18 - 2040.50] P:1351.86 E:0.099303 |  Although I think England are looking to make a quick exit here tonight with with these players involved in matches at the weekend
[2040.50 - 2046.26] P:1456.44 E:0.096341 |  And it's a long flight back two and a half hours or so here's stones in possession just at the left of the

[2070.38 - 2073.14] P:1482.72 E:0.089135 |  I think he rated himself at 50%
[2073.14 - 2076.94] P:1376.01 E:0.093723 |  He wanted to be better and he has impressed in these two matches
[2076.94 - 2083.22] P:1349.97 E:0.097204 |  And he's on the score sheet with his first goal for England since last November when he scored in the 5-0 win against Republic of Ireland
[2083.46 - 2085.90] P:1354.83 E:0.099989 |  Ball played by Anderson the cane on the left-hand side
[2086.02 - 2092.62] P:1411.02 E:0.104501 |  Cane goes for goal took an affliction which took it right across the penalty area and then a stretch and a head away by Tigan Yix

[2095.46 - 2101.90] P:1484.34 E:0.102160 |  I think it's a it's a lovely quirk that there's brilliant goal scoring season for Harry Kane yet again
[2102.78 - 2105.26] P:1559.42 E:0.100047 |  You know he scored against all and sundry
[2105.86 - 2112.90] P:1532.76 E:0.092858 |  Scoring his last seven appearances for club and country the last team that he failed to score against was

[2116.26 - 2121.10] P:1334.93 E:0.101864 |  It's a corner to England actually did bounce out of play just the other side of the corner flag
[2121.10 - 2123.10] P:1449.11 E:0.087447 |  So another set-piece chance
[2123.10 - 2124.82] P:1245.94 E:0.108183 |  How effective they were
[2124.82 - 2128.94] P:1378.91 E:0.103135 |  Scoring two of the goals in the aftermath of corners against Wales on Thursday
[2129.18 - 2134.86] P:1347.45 E:0.108355 |  Right standing with his hands on his hips now waiting to take this players clustered around the penalty spot

[2141.02 - 2143.74] P:1554.01 E:0.091457 |  But wanted too much time actually and he was closed down by
[2144.46 - 2147.18] P:1419.94 E:0.097078 |  good cops kids who has just
[2147.98 - 2153.62] P:1358.62 E:0.098228 |  Taken a knock in that challenge and he stayed down and Latvia put the ball out of play and I think he'll
[2154.22 - 2159.14] P:1497.87 E:0.098751 |  Receive some treatment. I think you got the brunt of Elliott Anderson's follow-through of that attempted shot
[2159.14 - 2161.14] P:1425.88 E:0.099167 |  He wanted the ball to come down. He was trying to
[2161.58 - 2164.58] P:1338.21 E:0.107945 |  Just put his foot through it from quite long range. It's good pressure
[2165.26 - 2166.78] P:1061.81 E:0.080806 |  from good
[2166.78 - 2169.70] P:1197.38 E:0.096171 |  good cost this and he's rubbing that right thigh

[2192.78 - 2196.22] P:1446.46 E:0.092026 |  Esri Konza no mark gay in the team tonight. He is on the bench though
[2196.22 - 2202.26] P:1431.36 E:0.095881 |  He's okay, but you're a crystal palace fan. Don't worry the balls play away by Latvia towards up towards good coughs
[2202.26 - 2204.98] P:1392.36 E:0.092375 |  Kids who seems okay, but he's out muscle
[2205.26 - 2210.40] P:1299.34 E:0.098260 |  Dispossessed by Esri Konza good management of that situation with Gary John
[2210.44 - 2213.32] P:1370.29 E:0.101169 |  I think so yeah consider it isn't it and across
[2214.20 - 2215.44] P:1170.65 E:0.088621 |  everything I
[2215.44 - 2220.48] P:1282.65 E:0.099115 |  Think that is an interesting decision and one that you know a lot of managers may not have made but I
[2220.96 - 2225.16] P:1326.46 E:0.084625 |  Think that's quite clever. Well crystal palace captain 12 matches. Yeah, I thought at all of the matches
[2225.16 - 2230.16] P:1556.34 E:0.098849 |  Yeah, the palace in all competitions. He has Gordon on the left hand side place the ball in right across the six yard box
[2230.16 - 2233.92] P:1357.40 E:0.091790 |  And I'm not sure how anyone didn't get a touch on that whether
[2234.52 - 2240.12] P:1396.34 E:0.103581 |  Attacker or defender and in the end Latvia were able to take possession and clear it away
[2241.20 - 2246.84] P:1350.94 E:0.107995 |  And Spain have taken the lead against Bulgaria and it's Mikhail Marino of Arsenal
[2246.84 - 2250.88] P:1561.78 E:0.102502 |  He has rice of Arsenal now to Gordon Gordon in the area goes for a little shot
[2251.00 - 2254.80] P:1514.44 E:0.087849 |  The defender was in front of him just trying to be cute with that didn't he yeah
[2254.80 - 2259.68] P:1375.83 E:0.091424 |  And they're saying that it took a deflection England and they're wanting a corner and the referee
[2260.12 - 2261.36] P:1416.90 E:0.087338 |  Does not agree?
[2261.36 - 2262.80] P:1474.35 E:0.065383 |  Tassos
[2262.80 - 2263.56] P:1508.76 E:0.125352 |  Siddiro
[2263.56 - 2269.28] P:1397.36 E:0.091702 |  Opelous and says it is good. I don't think there's a touch on that from when I see the slow mo but Anthony Gordon
[2269.28 - 2276.08] P:1416.15 E:0.096897 |  He is enjoying himself on this left-hand side really good quality into the box again and Harry Kane who's been slightly held
[2276.28 - 2278.28] P:1336.11 E:0.091477 |  In the box by by Balodis
[2279.64 - 2284.80] P:1414.27 E:0.095657 |  Couldn't quite get away from his marker because if he did it's just a tap in at the far post really good play from Gordon
[2284.80 - 2287.52] P:1467.95 E:0.093669 |  Well Latvia very nearly gave it away there, but
[2288.20 - 2292.52] P:1523.51 E:0.084446 |  They had to be sharp because Gordon was after it but it was cleared away on the edge of the box and
[2292.92 - 2298.92] P:1385.78 E:0.091136 |  And then there's a foul on Elliot Anderson Turkey and have three nil up on Georgia
[2298.96 - 2300.16] P:1379.16 E:0.067060 |  So both
[2300.16 - 2303.84] P:1405.19 E:0.094336 |  Turkey and Spain winning in that group group a
[2304.96 - 2308.44] P:1419.11 E:0.093355 |  Spain three points clear at the top of that section
[2309.04 - 2315.36] P:1462.10 E:0.087776 |  Portugal like England could qualify tonight, but they're one-one with Hungary and
[2316.08 - 2320.36] P:1315.80 E:0.101636 |  Republic of Ireland nil Armenia nil in the other match in that group
[2321.08 - 2322.92] P:1233.12 E:0.097969 |  Dublin
[2322.96 - 2330.20] P:1400.81 E:0.096037 |  So Anderson now up to Saka Saka who's in the middle of the Latvia half, but he's been forced away
[2330.72 - 2336.94] P:1667.47 E:0.093381 |  To and actually gives it to Anderson who curls it into the box and a stretching half in half clearance for
[2337.28 - 2340.20] P:1324.79 E:0.092407 |  Latvia bounces down now over there to the far side to
[2340.64 - 2344.80] P:1532.53 E:0.092240 |  Tegan Yix who's looking to work it away, which he does but it just gives possession back to England
[2345.44 - 2348.68] P:1410.79 E:0.092763 |  38 minutes played here in Riga England winning one nil
[2349.24 - 2353.60] P:1549.24 E:0.094821 |  They've dominated it and Kane's gonna have a shot from distance that's 25 yards plus
[2353.60 - 2358.66] P:1365.46 E:0.092275 |  But with his left foot pulls it well wider the post and bounces into the advertising
[2358.66 - 2360.52] P:1397.76 E:0.098925 |  Hordens to the right of the goal as he looks at it
[2360.52 - 2367.28] P:1369.13 E:0.101918 |  There's a nice bit of kind of interchanging amongst that front five really because I'll include Declan Rice in that whereas Kane
[2367.28 - 2372.44] P:1287.87 E:0.095597 |  Sometimes dropping out that time Anthony Gordon and made it all the way into the far post of the box
[2372.44 - 2378.64] P:1231.31 E:0.096337 |  Sometimes Saka's making it inside. There's a lot of nice movement between that whole front section of the team
[2379.20 - 2385.12] P:1458.67 E:0.095482 |  Really working off each other and balancing out if somebody goes in there then then Kane's dropping out or or Rice might hold
[2385.12 - 2387.40] P:1435.84 E:0.085948 |  Or then he might get in the box. He's got a nice
[2388.24 - 2392.56] P:1481.78 E:0.087480 |  Balance to it at the moment Thomas Tuchel just making two changes tonight
[2392.56 - 2399.52] P:1444.28 E:0.094283 |  The fewest number of changes match to match that that he's made so far in England five wins out of five in the group yet to
[2399.72 - 2401.32] P:1239.80 E:0.083091 |  Concedigal and
[2401.32 - 2403.24] P:1268.73 E:0.089384 |  At the moment getting the score line
[2403.24 - 2407.40] P:1462.89 E:0.093921 |  They need to qualify for the World Cup tonight with two matches to spare England with it on the edge of the box
[2407.40 - 2408.68] P:1475.56 E:0.092071 |  Rogers tries to play it in there
[2408.68 - 2415.60] P:1595.09 E:0.095394 |  That's cleared away up towards the the far side where all of those trees a line of trees with a slight autumn tinge to them
[2415.60 - 2419.00] P:1297.04 E:0.093265 |  All the way along that side of the ground and then these massive black
[2419.96 - 2421.44] P:1467.20 E:0.093732 |  rectangular
[2421.44 - 2423.44] P:1609.96 E:0.105289 |  video screen which is
[2423.76 - 2425.20] P:1357.23 E:0.081911 |  held up
[2425.20 - 2429.96] P:1481.58 E:0.098578 |  By two gray columns and absolutely dominates that side of the
[2430.96 - 2435.68] P:1434.55 E:0.093671 |  Pitch and I mean that they're playing a live feed of the game. I mean, it's just big TV screen
[2435.68 - 2440.96] P:1512.78 E:0.086847 |  You can watch it on you can inside the ground huge gray floodlight pylons. They are industrial
[2441.52 - 2443.52] P:1643.47 E:0.098963 |  They're the star of the show
[2444.16 - 2447.80] P:1573.41 E:0.087825 |  The best I've ever seen here's Saka on the right-hand side claims
[2447.80 - 2451.72] P:1537.36 E:0.099618 |  He was fouled referee agrees and pulls out another yellow card for that challenge on
[2452.24 - 2457.08] P:1598.53 E:0.094818 |  Bukhaeo Saka and a free kick for England in a good position. Yeah, great position this referee
[2457.76 - 2463.68] P:1550.52 E:0.092805 |  Getting the yellow card out again, but Saka just hovering over the ball. It's right in that position around the corner
[2464.08 - 2468.28] P:1507.55 E:0.092906 |  About five yards outside of the 18-yard box and he didn't like the reaction of
[2469.16 - 2474.44] P:1468.28 E:0.099175 |  The Latvian player. I think it was fellow this year went to ground and just kicked through the side of Saka
[2474.88 - 2478.16] P:1246.12 E:0.083538 |  Not too short. It's a yellow card though. Jennifer Moniz looking at the tackle. Yeah
[2479.16 - 2485.20] P:1492.73 E:0.089970 |  Hooked his right foot around a little card in it. It was a little he's not one of the
[2485.72 - 2491.60] P:1387.65 E:0.093714 |  The raft of Latvian players who came into this match one yellow card away from a suspension
[2492.20 - 2493.64] P:1160.28 E:0.081939 |  but
[2493.64 - 2497.48] P:1446.47 E:0.090059 |  really this defeat if it is to be a defeat means that
[2499.00 - 2503.48] P:1465.86 E:0.097930 |  Their most remote of opportunities are qualifying for the World Cup will have gone
[2504.08 - 2506.08] P:1494.15 E:0.083537 |  Saka then with this
[2506.48 - 2509.92] P:1413.77 E:0.091269 |  Free kick over there on the right-hand side
[2510.48 - 2515.22] P:1482.77 E:0.092609 |  He's going to play it in left-footed, but a leap and a header away by
[2515.88 - 2520.56] P:1485.00 E:0.084528 |  Sigan Yix comes back to Saka then it's worked in field to Anderson
[2520.80 - 2522.80] P:1719.06 E:0.086980 |  Four minutes to go to halftime
[2522.80 - 2528.64] P:1394.80 E:0.091432 |  England still leading through just the one goal Anthony Gordon, but could easily have had a couple more
[2529.36 - 2534.86] P:1439.79 E:0.092858 |  Elliot Anderson four caps now started the last four matches yours all already
[2535.30 - 2537.98] P:1467.47 E:0.101194 |  Almost feels like a part of the furniture
[2537.98 - 2543.14] P:1453.42 E:0.090015 |  It's unheard of to have to have your first four caps and you start all four games. He is right
[2543.14 - 2547.60] P:1582.61 E:0.094164 |  That's a good-looking Paul into the box. He whipped it in right for it headed away though
[2547.60 - 2552.02] P:1347.13 E:0.091225 |  Well defended Harry Kane now to the edge of the box and then Anderson and then a
[2552.70 - 2557.14] P:1412.83 E:0.104800 |  Ribona pass from Miles Lewis Skelly into the box that was half cleared away
[2557.66 - 2561.14] P:1363.01 E:0.109155 |  Rogers is over on the left-hand side and he
[2561.42 - 2567.62] P:1562.48 E:0.100219 |  Receives it back Morgan Rogers of Aston Deller into the box now the chance for Anderson with the shot across the face of gold
[2567.62 - 2573.42] P:1505.83 E:0.098976 |  But why do the far post from the angle slashed at it a little and hit it across the face of gold?
[2573.42 - 2577.62] P:1388.67 E:0.100167 |  I think that's the right phrase a little bit of a snatched effort from Anderson there just
[2578.10 - 2583.58] P:1409.74 E:0.097894 |  Found himself in space picked up a lovely position good pass from Rogers sees him in wraps the ball into him a
[2584.14 - 2585.58] P:1287.80 E:0.056516 |  little bit
[2585.58 - 2590.84] P:1473.45 E:0.094443 |  Frantic in the finish and he walks away kind of gesturing to himself as if to say needed a little bit more
[2590.96 - 2593.64] P:1341.56 E:0.088446 |  calmness and finesse on that finish but
[2594.28 - 2600.00] P:1264.67 E:0.096137 |  Again another midfield player having the balance and the intelligence to get into the right area in the box
[2600.00 - 2605.20] P:1459.35 E:0.090105 |  England find the pass and create a chance and done that well in his first half that via loss again
[2605.20 - 2608.16] P:1487.13 E:0.117625 |  Kane plays it through into the penalty area for Rice but goalkeeper
[2608.76 - 2615.56] P:1711.88 E:0.091064 |  The address does well actually anticipate about well quickly out of his six-yard box and grasp it at the feet of Declan Rice
[2616.00 - 2618.00] P:1096.95 E:0.073569 |  So
[2618.16 - 2621.88] P:1402.06 E:0.093811 |  Need to make a little note matter that chance for Anderson. Yeah
[2622.64 - 2624.64] P:1496.43 E:0.098035 |  across the face of goal and
[2624.80 - 2629.92] P:1485.76 E:0.099289 |  I mean a great noise coming out of that stand as England come forward again. Can't let the shot there
[2629.92 - 2634.36] P:1633.83 E:0.103294 |  It is it's 2-0 and Harry Kane scores from inside the D
[2635.36 - 2639.00] P:1603.48 E:0.101717 |  Typical came as he fell struck it perfectly
[2639.36 - 2646.60] P:1507.57 E:0.101593 |  Goalkeeper diving down to his right couldn't get there and came scores yet again for England 75
[2646.68 - 2651.64] P:1509.53 E:0.097204 |  Goals now to extend his record and it's Latvia near England to
[2652.44 - 2654.68] P:1606.20 E:0.094425 |  Alice Latvia trying to play out
[2655.12 - 2658.32] P:1459.92 E:0.089288 |  They get caught out the ball rebounds into Harry Kane
[2658.32 - 2663.60] P:1426.67 E:0.093204 |  And it's the last person on the pitch that you want the ball to come to in this area takes it on his left foot
[2663.92 - 2667.20] P:1409.68 E:0.103359 |  Drifts inside into that D on the edge of the 18-yard box
[2667.44 - 2674.00] P:1367.57 E:0.093370 |  And it's a fantastic finish with his left foot. I mean left foot right foot head any kind of finish
[2674.00 - 2676.88] P:1389.53 E:0.098888 |  That's a brilliant finish technically is leaning John
[2676.88 - 2679.00] P:1437.57 E:0.101557 |  So all these body weights coming on to the ball
[2679.20 - 2682.96] P:1414.50 E:0.099213 |  He puts a nice bit of shape gets good contact with his left foot
[2683.16 - 2686.56] P:1340.27 E:0.099473 |  Bit of curve on it bouncing with pace into the bottom corner
[2687.52 - 2694.00] P:1375.32 E:0.098214 |  Fantastic finish on your left foot from that position. I mean that is world-class and you just cannot
[2694.56 - 2700.62] P:1373.07 E:0.097664 |  Allow the ball to bounce to him in that kind of situation is absolutely lethal. Yeah, I feel like I've seen him score that
[2700.62 - 2702.62] P:1308.17 E:0.087511 |  Yeah
[2702.62 - 2707.22] P:1417.45 E:0.088489 |  No, but but it's either foot, isn't it? Yeah, that's the impressive thing
[2707.22 - 2712.64] P:1247.11 E:0.084070 |  He's got the quality to be that precise with either foot. I mean it's top stuff
[2712.64 - 2715.76] P:1352.63 E:0.098778 |  And that's from that's from years of working dedication
[2716.64 - 2718.64] P:1260.11 E:0.078975 |  and making
[2719.36 - 2725.32] P:1525.48 E:0.104506 |  Self as good with each foot so two-nil race with across now to the back post that's headed down by Kane
[2725.64 - 2731.08] P:1618.21 E:0.102129 |  And it's blocked on the edge of the six-yard area. He headed it down into the ground
[2731.56 - 2733.56] P:1397.65 E:0.091409 |  And it was deflected
[2733.72 - 2738.80] P:1393.69 E:0.102271 |  Up and wide of the goal for an England corner. Yeah, but body language of the Latvian players has gone
[2739.20 - 2742.44] P:1462.92 E:0.101045 |  And I think that this this could be a very challenging
[2743.44 - 2747.24] P:1414.61 E:0.096741 |  Second half for Latvia if they don't come out with a slightly better
[2748.20 - 2751.28] P:1472.82 E:0.107132 |  Persona about I'm England just completely dominating this game
[2752.16 - 2754.40] P:1072.95 E:0.099510 |  And look like they could score at will at the moment
[2754.40 - 2755.84] P:1434.02 E:0.094589 |  It's actually a decent save wasn't it?
[2755.84 - 2758.80] P:1554.63 E:0.101699 |  Yeah, it was a good because it bounced right in front of the goalkeeper as Kane heads it down
[2758.80 - 2761.44] P:1433.44 E:0.094742 |  It hits the turf and he's got to save it kind of on the way up
[2762.12 - 2766.50] P:1510.04 E:0.089508 |  But he did and he pushed it away wide. He was at fault for one of the Andorra goals
[2767.22 - 2769.22] P:1447.25 E:0.097869 |  Sviatris at the weekend
[2769.38 - 2774.18] P:1606.50 E:0.100207 |  Well, here's the corner and they are crowding the goalkeeper and in it comes in see address does well
[2774.18 - 2777.30] P:1754.88 E:0.098175 |  He gets his right arm to it under severe pressure there
[2778.26 - 2779.70] P:1611.89 E:0.094956 |  Defenders attackers
[2779.70 - 2785.38] P:1434.35 E:0.086331 |  It was a packed six-yard area and the goalkeeper did well on the stretch to hook it away
[2785.50 - 2792.38] P:1480.26 E:0.088704 |  So we are one minute of added time Harry Kane's scored again for England as I say 75 goals now
[2792.38 - 2799.66] P:1464.33 E:0.088664 |  This is his 110th appearance his fifth on the list of most appearances and he's setting a target here
[2800.18 - 2803.50] P:1513.10 E:0.103659 |  Harry Kane the age of 32 now that
[2803.98 - 2807.02] P:1436.87 E:0.098660 |  very likely won't be caught for
[2808.42 - 2813.90] P:1312.06 E:0.103979 |  Nearly decades and decades and decades and here's Rice carrying the ball forward, but
[2814.66 - 2815.78] P:1250.19 E:0.107719 |  referee's
[2815.78 - 2819.10] P:1245.60 E:0.098341 |  spotted an infringement and he stopped play
[2819.98 - 2827.06] P:1395.08 E:0.095094 |  What is happening here? He's walking across to as recon that and he's actually going to the screen
[2827.62 - 2834.08] P:1372.04 E:0.088280 |  So this I'm guessing this could be a penalty for England was this from the corner. Is it from?
[2835.78 - 2844.02] P:1488.50 E:0.095700 |  potentially because I mean that the corner I was like was absolutely whether not VA I've taken some time to find some kind of holding a fence
[2845.02 - 2850.98] P:1500.93 E:0.099735 |  Yeah, well the drama player it the amnesian splendid isolation the referee over there on the pressure over there
[2850.98 - 2857.80] P:1571.13 E:0.093115 |  Unless the trees are going to get onto him and the suggestion is that that Kane was shoved over by his opposite number
[2858.30 - 2860.30] P:1396.51 E:0.116268 |  I don't know
[2860.50 - 2862.50] P:1335.13 E:0.073911 |  the penalties given and
[2863.26 - 2869.60] P:1571.48 E:0.094175 |  Yellow cards coming out for Anthony's chain of Mordes as well who shoved over Harry Kane
[2869.62 - 2873.30] P:1533.47 E:0.082932 |  I think he did I think I shot I think Kane
[2874.06 - 2876.06] P:1461.06 E:0.088266 |  Kains bought that one
[2876.26 - 2882.06] P:1499.98 E:0.092553 |  I'm not sure about VA are getting involved in that. I mean if the referee gives it on field
[2882.90 - 2884.46] P:1236.32 E:0.076175 |  You'd expect
[2884.46 - 2886.38] P:1260.32 E:0.100712 |  Them to kind of have a good look at it
[2886.38 - 2891.02] P:1508.36 E:0.088426 |  But I'm not sure there was quite enough from what I only saw a briefing a brief
[2891.78 - 2898.50] P:1471.02 E:0.090412 |  Slow-mo, but it looked like Kane was more than happy to feel the contact and go go down to the floor
[2898.50 - 2903.74] P:1591.65 E:0.087417 |  And suddenly the heavens have opened as Harry Kane picks himself open is preparing to take this
[2903.74 - 2907.38] P:1569.12 E:0.094752 |  We've got we've got Baltic rain coming straight down
[2907.78 - 2911.70] P:1470.02 E:0.089174 |  On the on the pitch and Harry Kane just steps away
[2911.70 - 2918.82] P:1460.03 E:0.098971 |  But then actually comes back again and re spots the ball. So Harry Kane. This is his 28th penalty for England
[2920.26 - 2926.26] P:1531.44 E:0.106797 |  England's number nine to make it 3-0 and surely put the outcome beyond out with his right foot
[2926.42 - 2928.50] P:1467.27 E:0.112055 |  He sends the goalkeeper the wrong way
[2929.02 - 2937.06] P:1610.83 E:0.093627 |  It's 3-0 to England Kane scored two of them and this score line is going to take England to the World Cup in
[2937.70 - 2943.56] P:1601.79 E:0.099691 |  2026 there's little doubt of that now even though it's still not half-time Latvia nail England 3. Yeah
[2943.56 - 2949.38] P:1495.19 E:0.088294 |  I mean when the second goal went in Latvia absolutely just body language collapsed and
[2949.86 - 2952.44] P:1466.79 E:0.086293 |  Yeah, they've not had a good five minutes
[2952.44 - 2959.52] P:1555.91 E:0.091453 |  I mean, I think it's more holding on the penalty than anything. There's a big grab of the shirt from Cherno Mordis
[2960.32 - 2962.84] P:1379.74 E:0.085400 |  Which I think then came false to the floor
[2962.84 - 2967.12] P:1492.70 E:0.078856 |  But I'm not sure the grab of the shirt forced the drop to the floor
[2967.12 - 2970.40] P:1547.95 E:0.087462 |  But Harry Kane taking no prisoners with that penalty bottom
[2971.04 - 2973.04] P:1622.31 E:0.087699 |  Corner to the goalkeepers right
[2973.40 - 2980.96] P:1481.59 E:0.078627 |  Straight with power into the side of the net brilliant penalty and they half-time whistle has gone and England are in complete
[2981.40 - 2986.76] P:1546.68 E:0.096896 |  Charge of this World Cup qualifier Latvia nail England 3 and you know what as well
[2987.24 - 2989.24] P:1432.75 E:0.099797 |  Harry Kane that this will be the
[2989.84 - 2994.36] P:1554.23 E:0.095387 |  This will be the the sixth major tournament World Cup European Championship
[2994.36 - 2999.30] P:1705.61 E:0.105078 |  that he'll have been to and he when England have clinched
[2999.74 - 3001.74] P:1877.00 E:0.096401 |  Qualification for the previous five
[3001.88 - 3007.32] P:1664.37 E:0.100667 |  Kane has scored in every single one of those matches and he's got two here tonight
[3007.96 - 3014.20] P:1612.48 E:0.100073 |  He and England have been unstoppable that yeah, just phenomenal golf scorer that he is
[3014.20 - 3018.52] P:1621.72 E:0.094464 |  I mean he should have a hat trick really which tells you how good England have been
[3018.52 - 3024.08] P:1500.64 E:0.078692 |  I mean Latvia haven't put up that much of a fight they had to go first 15-20 minutes
[3024.08 - 3029.12] P:1567.64 E:0.086579 |  But the moment the first goal went in they've not given a good account of themselves, but England have done well
[3029.12 - 3035.24] P:1553.97 E:0.084043 |  I have to say they've got good movement good balance, you know the players look hungry the physicalities there
[3035.24 - 3040.16] P:1444.86 E:0.081695 |  The directness is there it's been it's been a very good away performance so far
[3040.16 - 3047.80] P:1762.68 E:0.086366 |  So that's for Harry Kane three goals for England this season 18 goals for buying Munich. So that's 21
[3047.80 - 3053.48] P:1802.34 E:0.087225 |  And where is he in comparison to Erling Harland now who's whose exploits?
[3053.48 - 3058.84] P:1706.72 E:0.097113 |  I'm sure have not been missed by the England captain Harland also 21 goals
[3059.36 - 3065.12] P:1778.80 E:0.093595 |  For club and country so far this season and and Portugal are now two one up on Hungary
[3065.12 - 3070.04] P:1702.42 E:0.087274 |  As we've mentioned Portugal it is possible for them and it's Ronaldo who scored again in that match
[3070.04 - 3076.12] P:1707.97 E:0.095211 |  It is possible for Portugal to clinch their place at the World Cup as well tonight in Italy winning 1-0 against Israel
[3076.12 - 3083.00] P:1662.18 E:0.086340 |  I see as well, but there we are that's it half time here in Riga Latvia nil England 3 Kelly
[3083.36 - 3087.08] P:1646.12 E:0.105681 |  John Murray Ian Dennis and Matthew Upson in Riga. Thank you very much
[3087.08 - 3090.88] P:1469.57 E:0.096981 |  We will be back with them for the second half of that game, but England very much in control
[3091.12 - 3095.24] P:1836.89 E:0.107247 |  England fans really enjoying themselves. You may have started to hear that coming through on the radio
[3095.24 - 3098.80] P:1666.40 E:0.092802 |  And Thomas Tuchel has been complaining that Wembley was a bit quiet the other day
[3098.80 - 3104.24] P:1852.86 E:0.093833 |  So the England fans have been singing are we loud enough for you amongst other things in Riga this evening?
[3104.24 - 3109.60] P:1867.42 E:0.088114 |  Conor Cody is with us as well. Conor will will get your thoughts on that penalty decision in a second
[3109.60 - 3114.32] P:1711.41 E:0.091955 |  But overall it's the first half that we thought it would be England absolutely dominant
[3114.32 - 3118.16] P:1655.60 E:0.082893 |  And they could be more than three up to be honest at halftime. They've been great. They've been great
[3118.16 - 3124.24] P:1714.03 E:0.085755 |  They've been professional. They've been everything we expected Kelly haven't either way they've played the way they've moved the ball from side to side
[3124.24 - 3129.92] P:1514.92 E:0.098078 |  It was funny actually because they've had all the ball in the first goal comes from John Stones being clever understanding the game and just flipping it in
[3129.92 - 3132.44] P:1156.07 E:0.093551 |  Beirn Frantony-Golden to running behind and score a fantastic goal
[3132.44 - 3138.20] P:1790.39 E:0.084639 |  But yeah, I think it was everything we expected, but we expected England to put on a bit of a show and have been fantastic
[3138.20 - 3142.80] P:1555.75 E:0.087615 |  So long may continue in the second half. Yeah, then they're showing that they're able to break down Latvia
[3142.80 - 3149.36] P:1876.75 E:0.090631 |  However, that third goal came from I'm gonna say I mean sometimes in in European games
[3149.36 - 3154.40] P:1857.91 E:0.087604 |  You get penalties that wouldn't necessarily be given in the Premier League. I'm not sure where this one is on the scale
[3154.64 - 3155.76] P:1613.41 E:0.099157 |  Yeah
[3155.76 - 3159.56] P:1735.37 E:0.096350 |  Do you know what I've just been saying there about do you know if it was anyone other than a Harry Kane?
[3159.56 - 3162.46] P:1400.03 E:0.112272 |  We'd probably give him a bit of stick won't we all he's died, but we could be love Harry Kane
[3162.46 - 3164.40] P:1510.20 E:0.091701 |  He's bad. Listen, it wasn't a dive. He's obviously
[3164.40 - 3166.16] P:1683.15 E:0.116494 |  He's been clever. He's played for it
[3166.16 - 3169.80] P:1224.72 E:0.108681 |  But we would always say that we're Harry Kane one of you if someone else we'd be given them a bit of stick
[3169.80 - 3176.08] P:1606.52 E:0.091636 |  But that's he's played for it. He's a clever clever footballer and there's any practices pens penalties the day before every game
[3176.08 - 3178.76] P:1587.82 E:0.102456 |  And we've seen a little bit of a change in technique a little bit of a stutter
[3178.76 - 3180.12] P:1181.56 E:0.101959 |  Usually he whips it into the corner
[3180.12 - 3184.02] P:1443.92 E:0.082820 |  He did whip it into the corner, but the little stutter before was lovely and you expected nothing else from him
[3185.04 - 3189.64] P:1658.71 E:0.088650 |  Yeah, and this England's second goal Harry Kane's first goal of the game and they said it in commentary
[3189.64 - 3192.38] P:1921.00 E:0.092652 |  It felt like a blueprint of a Harry Harry Kane goal
[3192.38 - 3198.04] P:1687.62 E:0.088199 |  It did it did and it was a brilliant bit of playing the one play you wanted to fall to and unless you you'd say that about a
[3198.04 - 3203.92] P:1661.79 E:0.090488 |  Lot of England players, but just his record he's been on 76 goals now in 110 caps is is remarkable
[3203.92 - 3207.82] P:1719.34 E:0.088977 |  The the numbers he's put it up a fantastic this season both for club and country
[3207.82 - 3213.44] P:1535.11 E:0.091096 |  And you want it to fall to one man right or left foot and it falls to Harry Kane and the way you put it in the corner
[3213.44 - 3218.46] P:1642.86 E:0.096583 |  The positions he finds himself into find these goals and find the side net of the goal the detail
[3218.46 - 3223.32] P:1725.64 E:0.086685 |  He puts into his finishing is all down to repetition and like I said to fall to him on the edge of the box
[3223.32 - 3225.56] P:1746.91 E:0.079509 |  For Latvia, you don't want it to fall to him, but for us
[3225.56 - 3227.48] P:1488.50 E:0.061516 |  It's it's never so what's going to end up in the back of the net
[3228.84 - 3233.56] P:1831.89 E:0.092753 |  So a couple of goals for Harry Kane in the first half of that game one for Anthony Gordon as well
[3233.56 - 3235.36] P:1625.51 E:0.101226 |  Connor's gonna be with us throughout the evening
[3235.36 - 3240.20] P:1999.75 E:0.088956 |  And we'll be back in Riga very shortly for the second half commentary first though
[3240.20 - 3244.04] P:1663.62 E:0.090582 |  It's time for the BBC news with Ryan Dobney the voice of the UK

[3467.96 - 3472.88] P:2017.89 E:0.067499 |  So they'll be a little bit more familiar with the conditions than England though, you know under Charlotte Edgerton's leadership

[3504.12 - 3507.72] P:1586.68 E:0.082724 |  So they're starting to put together what looks like a pretty good run of form
[3508.32 - 3514.04] P:1885.05 E:0.084318 |  Absolutely, I think they could do with a few more contributions from other batters particularly in the top order
[3514.16 - 3517.68] P:1944.46 E:0.072584 |  We've seen match winning contributions from Heather Knight and that silver brunt there to
[3518.24 - 3521.56] P:2116.72 E:0.072191 |  Experienced heads and in these conditions which are proving really difficult
[3521.96 - 3525.88] P:1872.48 E:0.066344 |  That's probably what you would expect they've played here before they've played the most for England
[3525.88 - 3528.92] P:1934.49 E:0.080550 |  But it's proving to be a really difficult tournament for openers
[3528.92 - 3532.08] P:1898.21 E:0.071534 |  So there's a little bit of pressure on Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones to step up

[3538.64 - 3544.64] P:1874.64 E:0.069269 |  But the point is is that somebody is always stepping up and that is the most promising thing for them with you know much greater
[3544.76 - 3548.72] P:1972.22 E:0.081291 |  Challenges to come in India and Australia and then they should make a semi-final
[3548.72 - 3553.20] P:1796.52 E:0.069442 |  And that's when we'll find out where they're at, you know against the top sides and under pressure
[3553.20 - 3556.52] P:1895.16 E:0.059063 |  But all they can do at this point is beat the teams in front of them
[3556.52 - 3558.76] P:1706.90 E:0.095971 |  It's not their fault that the fixtures have been quite kind to them
[3558.76 - 3563.60] P:1914.40 E:0.076547 |  And if they can go into those games against India and Australia which are there next to after Pakistan
[3563.68 - 3566.96] P:1800.12 E:0.063246 |  They can go into those unbeaten then they couldn't have asked for any more than that
[3567.24 - 3573.44] P:1659.69 E:0.070623 |  And to do that they will have to beat the side that sits at the bottom of the table Pakistan tomorrow

[3599.04 - 3605.56] P:1530.07 E:0.082437 |  It's very very difficult to win in Australia as an England side. It's tears or any side Australia have to be massive favorites
[3605.56 - 3608.88] P:1831.42 E:0.092706 |  When the question really was which teams under the most pressure
[3609.44 - 3614.44] P:1369.29 E:0.074825 |  Well, Australia under the most pressure because they're expected to win. They're brilliant at home
[3614.52 - 3616.80] P:1603.40 E:0.072269 |  but they've got question marks over their team and

[3623.88 - 3627.96] P:1660.12 E:0.073583 |  It's a fact. It's probably the worst Australian team since 2010

[3632.08 - 3635.56] P:1730.30 E:0.074846 |  English team since 2010 so those things match up

[3690.96 - 3694.64] P:1642.21 E:0.091153 |  No, it wasn't they drop points and they needed a late penalty

[3729.84 - 3732.56] P:1571.35 E:0.103298 |  Absolutely not a game in which Chelsea would have foreseen
[3732.96 - 3738.16] P:1412.61 E:0.100392 |  Dropping points so this is a really big game for them at home to Paris because you know drop points again

[3740.44 - 3743.62] P:1839.53 E:0.097322 |  Which is going to be a huge test for Chelsea and thinking well
[3743.62 - 3748.92] P:1269.53 E:0.102543 |  Actually, they're giving themselves a real mountain to climb to finish in that top four and go straight through to the quarter finals
[3750.36 - 3755.66] P:1908.06 E:0.101681 |  Vicki how much of an issue have injuries been for Chelsea or clearly not in in the WSL
[3755.66 - 3759.32] P:1924.66 E:0.086879 |  But are we seeing it it kind of affect them in the champions league?
[3760.28 - 3765.48] P:1855.22 E:0.107104 |  Yeah, they do have some big players out steal the likes of Cadice B canon Naomi German Lauren James
[3765.48 - 3770.48] P:1378.79 E:0.114389 |  Of course who's also not been included in the latest England squad because of injury and my river mirrors
[3770.48 - 3773.60] P:1552.45 E:0.095624 |  They've just got Lucy bronze and a knee chance back from injury
[3773.60 - 3777.84] P:1505.60 E:0.100379 |  But I think the bigger problem Kelly and it's something that Sonya bomb pastore is clearly
[3778.28 - 3780.68] P:1668.32 E:0.105561 |  Infuriated by their manager because she keeps mentioning it
[3780.76 - 3787.38] P:1703.95 E:0.092913 |  It's not for want of trying Chelsea in terms of chances both against FSA 20 and I was there sir

[3794.32 - 3799.28] P:1642.49 E:0.096309 |  But only four of them were on target and it was just the one goal by which they won
[3799.28 - 3801.32] P:1533.25 E:0.099567 |  And I think that is the key at the moment
[3801.32 - 3803.36] P:1685.55 E:0.112541 |  They're getting into really good positions
[3803.36 - 3809.20] P:1267.56 E:0.095852 |  But it's the final cross the final shot the final ball that's letting them down at the moment and as bomb pastore said look that
[3809.20 - 3813.88] P:1544.26 E:0.097278 |  They had so many chances in that opener against FSA 20, but they couldn't find the breakthrough
[3814.32 - 3818.48] P:1665.05 E:0.096937 |  20 scored a super goal to put them ahead and and they end up not
[3818.88 - 3823.80] P:1516.00 E:0.102748 |  Killing the opposition's hope was the way she put it and and I think that's the bigger problem for them at the moment

[3887.00 - 3892.72] P:1594.59 E:0.103178 |  Second best throughout tonight England have dominated from the very first whistle. They are leading by three goals to nil England
[3892.72 - 3895.04] P:1689.30 E:0.104751 |  Haven't made any alterations so they have pick fitting goal
[3896.04 - 3898.04] P:1814.02 E:0.099838 |  Spence cons the stones in Lewis Skelly
[3898.92 - 3906.36] P:1534.71 E:0.093689 |  Anderson Sacker rice Rogers and Gordon and Harry Kane with the two goals one of them a penalty in that first half
[3906.36 - 3913.36] P:1493.83 E:0.095872 |  So three nil and more than on their way to the Americas for World Cup qualification next summer
[3913.36 - 3919.16] P:1703.80 E:0.101453 |  However, Thomas Tuchel, I'm sure would have said to his players. Listen. You're in this position against Wales on Thursday
[3919.48 - 3920.92] P:1301.73 E:0.097107 |  You didn't build on that
[3920.92 - 3926.08] P:1605.79 E:0.099319 |  I don't want any let up as Gordon sends over across and Spence keeps it alive inside the penalty area
[3926.28 - 3929.92] P:1580.77 E:0.100633 |  Rogers is there and then it was able to get the ball away from
[3930.40 - 3933.92] P:1643.16 E:0.105369 |  Zelentkovs in the midfield Latvia then with speed dressing goal
[3934.36 - 3939.76] P:1511.93 E:0.098301 |  It's going to be bikes to the more dis below this is the back three Tony says fast lands
[3940.12 - 3941.64] P:1398.64 E:0.088234 |  that they Zelentkovs
[3941.92 - 3947.80] P:1581.46 E:0.092421 |  Siganics and then good coughs kiss and it can't use as the the two up front in the
[3948.08 - 3953.68] P:1531.54 E:0.104184 |  The all Carmine red that little flash of orange down the side of the shirt a little bit of white in there as well
[3954.20 - 3956.20] P:1324.59 E:0.080072 |  What's the Carmine?
[3956.20 - 3960.72] P:1581.42 E:0.099624 |  I went I went to see whether it was sort of like a maroon or a burgundy
[3960.72 - 3964.16] P:1519.39 E:0.081355 |  But the official colour for Latvia is Carmine red is it? Yeah
[3965.08 - 3969.84] P:1588.47 E:0.093839 |  The red symbolizes courage and struggle the white on their flag
[3970.68 - 3972.68] P:1508.17 E:0.079015 |  nobility and openness
[3973.72 - 3980.32] P:1543.08 E:0.099221 |  Lovely well, they've certainly struggled in this game so far I can tell you two and a half minutes in it's it's the reaction
[3980.60 - 3984.76] P:1304.38 E:0.089678 |  After I think it was the second goal went in if there was a shift in the body language of Latvia
[3984.76 - 3986.32] P:1434.08 E:0.087778 |  I think that you know before that
[3986.32 - 3992.48] P:1556.05 E:0.091991 |  They're at home. They're playing England. They're trying to showcase themselves and do the best they can but it's just kind of dropped off
[3992.48 - 3994.80] P:1409.99 E:0.084629 |  and we'll see start this second half now if they've
[3995.48 - 3998.40] P:1304.23 E:0.100017 |  Got a little bit more bounce in their step, but it is difficult
[3998.40 - 4001.52] P:1374.95 E:0.094625 |  It's demoralizing when you've just not got the ball and you defend it all the time
[4001.88 - 4008.32] P:1473.78 E:0.097215 |  And Anderson again wins the ball he tracked over to this near side got his foot into the challenge got the ball towards Saka
[4008.52 - 4010.52] P:1533.09 E:0.093463 |  He just does it so effectively
[4010.80 - 4011.60] P:1150.46 E:0.092404 |  Does sir?
[4011.60 - 4017.12] P:1542.46 E:0.102847 |  Elliot Anderson who really has it's been seamless the way that he's just slotted into international football
[4017.12 - 4022.76] P:1373.29 E:0.103613 |  It makes it harder like the Bellingham situation that adds another dimension to it as well because it's not even you could then play
[4022.80 - 4026.60] P:1269.87 E:0.108221 |  Deeper with rice with how well Anderson is doing you know what I mean?
[4026.60 - 4029.96] P:1146.01 E:0.098055 |  It takes that off the table as well for for Thomas Tuchel almost
[4030.44 - 4033.72] P:1406.03 E:0.094199 |  It is a bleep night in the Baltics
[4034.68 - 4037.48] P:1325.66 E:0.101109 |  The rain pouring down. It's cold
[4038.32 - 4043.80] P:1508.22 E:0.101024 |  And the England supporters I mean, I don't think Thomas Tuchel criticized the
[4044.24 - 4047.48] P:1532.13 E:0.104110 |  The crowd at Wembley last Thursday saying they were too silent
[4047.48 - 4052.28] P:1461.18 E:0.103197 |  I don't think anybody could ever criticize the England away support. They're extremely loyal
[4052.28 - 4059.60] P:1549.85 E:0.099599 |  Yeah, they're extremely vocal wherever England will travel but throughout that first half they were going through the full repertoire
[4060.24 - 4061.64] P:1229.20 E:0.084201 |  some that
[4061.64 - 4065.94] P:1522.76 E:0.092644 |  I'm unable to repeat but to cool Tuchel give us a song
[4067.04 - 4069.52] P:1442.30 E:0.113222 |  To nil to the library was one at one stage
[4071.08 - 4073.72] P:1367.17 E:0.120694 |  I think are we loud enough for you?
[4073.72 - 4080.92] P:1445.06 E:0.093016 |  I think he got the feeling in that home game because it was a low you mentioned that the Derby game didn't and I know whether expecting that and
[4080.92 - 4086.68] P:1310.13 E:0.095797 |  Obviously the voice that the Welsh fans always carry with them is pretty spectacular isn't it with their supporters?
[4086.68 - 4090.04] P:1351.77 E:0.096183 |  I think that that's probably made it feel the way it did for him
[4090.80 - 4094.12] P:1349.34 E:0.114074 |  But I think it's better point out that in the pouring rain and the cold
[4094.12 - 4099.32] P:1567.48 E:0.102461 |  I'm not fair play to them. No fair. They're are a number in fact. Tell me where they've gone
[4099.32 - 4104.44] P:1500.02 E:0.098739 |  In fact, they you can't beat football fans for improvising and adapting to a situation
[4104.44 - 4109.20] P:1525.52 E:0.097817 |  I was thinking they might have disappeared, but they haven't they've actually gone underneath the stadium
[4109.20 - 4114.04] P:1514.59 E:0.102973 |  Oh, yeah, so now it's elevated on like concrete platforms that end away towards our right
[4114.16 - 4118.84] P:1464.79 E:0.097893 |  They're watching behind the metal gates now on that right-hand side the England supporters
[4118.96 - 4124.80] P:1471.28 E:0.099303 |  And I don't blame them as they shelter from the pouring rain as England playing from left to right all in white
[4125.16 - 4127.96] P:1613.37 E:0.099437 |  leading by three goals to nil I've got a free kick which is
[4129.12 - 4134.64] P:1566.09 E:0.102270 |  Level with almost level with the at the Latvian penalty area and this one is curled. It's fired in
[4134.92 - 4139.44] P:1374.26 E:0.089908 |  It's got a touch of a Latvian head in a very crowded penalty area and
[4140.16 - 4143.68] P:1472.91 E:0.101802 |  Harry Kane was desperate to get on the end of that. What is that now?
[4144.36 - 4148.08] P:1429.86 E:0.100783 |  76 goals in his 110th game, right?
[4149.64 - 4154.76] P:1376.19 E:0.100064 |  Really amazing numbers, but that delivery from Declan Rice with his right foot
[4154.76 - 4158.48] P:1456.11 E:0.101501 |  I mean he's set piece delivery now is so good corner taken quickly the goalkeepers
[4158.72 - 4164.92] P:1639.49 E:0.103403 |  Palms the ball away only as far as Gordon controls it plays it towards Harry Kane back heals the ball towards Gordon
[4165.08 - 4167.80] P:1549.63 E:0.100885 |  And then it's broken up over on that far side by
[4168.12 - 4171.72] P:1516.26 E:0.092794 |  Robert's Vapes and they try and run it away on that far side
[4171.72 - 4177.04] P:1650.95 E:0.098265 |  It's looking at Harry Kane as well who's scored the most competitive goals for England that is 68
[4177.84 - 4179.84] P:1377.70 E:0.104693 |  competitive goals in 92
[4180.12 - 4182.12] P:1493.15 E:0.089228 |  competitive games
[4183.12 - 4185.12] P:1209.25 E:0.102380 |  And
[4185.32 - 4188.52] P:1453.83 E:0.112011 |  Finishing like that left footed goal, you can see why can't you?
[4188.52 - 4192.32] P:1311.41 E:0.102809 |  This is top of the game stuff that with the one he missed in the first half
[4192.32 - 4198.12] P:1603.14 E:0.103146 |  He easily could have had a hat trick yet a goal disallowed inside the opening 60 seconds to remember they lead 3 nil
[4198.12 - 4201.00] P:1372.93 E:0.099670 |  They're England on this this near side the
[4201.56 - 4208.00] P:1525.92 E:0.105018 |  Blond-haired figure of Tony says the substitute England are quick to try and hunt impacts again and close down Latvia
[4208.48 - 4215.68] P:1515.77 E:0.108035 |  That's what Thomas Tuchel want them to maintain that intensity and then you'll have that raft of substitutions that we had on Thursday
[4216.68 - 4221.12] P:1512.18 E:0.100668 |  You know for players to come off the bench and also to try and make their impression
[4221.12 - 4225.60] P:1369.17 E:0.103592 |  I think a big part of this now that he'll want to see who want to see the team be ruthless or want to see
[4226.00 - 4231.26] P:1282.13 E:0.108218 |  You know no ease up whatsoever on that reaction to win the ball back the work great
[4231.26 - 4233.46] P:1402.28 E:0.091534 |  You want to if anything see it get you even better
[4234.10 - 4241.74] P:1449.76 E:0.089858 |  Spence his header in field tied it up by stones all the way to to Jordan Pickford who will be
[4243.06 - 4248.66] P:1532.83 E:0.101884 |  Looking to extend his own record now. He's beat that one that he shared with that with Gordon Banks previously
[4249.82 - 4255.52] P:1533.08 E:0.100981 |  Your ninth consecutive clean sheet for Jordan Pickford and he's 42nd in total
[4255.52 - 4258.02] P:1440.74 E:0.092827 |  And what is his 80th appearance?
[4258.02 - 4263.58] P:1287.89 E:0.085940 |  Some achievement to go through a qualification group without conceiving the gold then I wouldn't it yeah
[4263.58 - 4266.66] P:1307.13 E:0.092047 |  Well, I don't know how many times that's happened, but I can't think very many I
[4267.30 - 4272.74] P:1461.12 E:0.099863 |  Was looking at halftime the last time it happened was for Italian 90 was it but they only played eight games
[4272.74 - 4277.54] P:1536.60 E:0.091895 |  And I think it also happened in 86 as well in England qualified for Mexico
[4278.42 - 4282.06] P:1567.22 E:0.095698 |  86 England though now have scored in each of their last
[4283.02 - 4288.54] P:1576.80 E:0.100284 |  18 games the last time it was 18 was back in 1950 to 1955
[4289.30 - 4292.28] P:1629.97 E:0.102705 |  Although they're still somewhere short of the record of 52
[4293.26 - 4300.02] P:1492.15 E:0.100477 |  Which was 1884 to 1902 so that will that will take you well beyond Thomas Tuchel's reign as an England manager
[4300.14 - 4302.14] P:1712.18 E:0.083067 |  As here is that Spence
[4302.50 - 4307.58] P:1415.17 E:0.108504 |  The rain continuing to team down Rogers back towards Anderson once again
[4307.94 - 4313.48] P:1503.33 E:0.098060 |  As he plays the ball hard to the feet of Saka from Anderson and Saka now has spent just behind him
[4313.50 - 4319.90] P:1583.36 E:0.097675 |  Rogers inside the penalty area and this in is available gets it out turns on the inside passes the ball now towards
[4321.14 - 4324.82] P:1568.76 E:0.099051 |  Lewis Skelly Lewis Skelly passes the ball back and John Stones
[4325.50 - 4329.26] P:1395.86 E:0.104532 |  Passes the ball out to the left where Declan Rice is the one who provides the whip
[4329.26 - 4332.58] P:1535.78 E:0.099948 |  Gordon's on the inside England still passing it around sharply and swiftly
[4333.02 - 4334.90] P:1237.03 E:0.099629 |  See when that ball got set back to Anderson there
[4334.90 - 4339.30] P:1368.33 E:0.096193 |  I felt he probably should have crossed it first time with his right foot, but we have three players from midfield. I think it was
[4340.18 - 4345.26] P:1469.25 E:0.089810 |  Rogers Rice Kaine and Gordon was tucking in all arriving in the box for that cross
[4345.98 - 4351.14] P:1574.27 E:0.100386 |  Here is the Saka level of the penalty area rolls it gently back towards Anderson
[4351.94 - 4356.74] P:1575.81 E:0.104597 |  Judging by the hand actions of that hopes and he was expecting Anderson again to whip that ball in early
[4356.74 - 4360.62] P:1561.64 E:0.094186 |  But he didn't they patient they go back stones then out towards rice
[4361.14 - 4364.38] P:1366.78 E:0.097072 |  Gordon then makes that run from into out on that left-hand side
[4364.38 - 4367.90] P:1529.52 E:0.104996 |  But rice now runs in field 35 yards out from goal
[4368.14 - 4371.18] P:1664.69 E:0.102775 |  Rogers to Saka on the stretch edge of the area move breaks down
[4371.18 - 4374.94] P:1494.28 E:0.103108 |  But again soon as they lose the ball yeah England then a quick to win it back
[4375.86 - 4378.34] P:1510.22 E:0.114229 |  Although the turn away there by the
[4379.02 - 4382.58] P:1651.41 E:0.117997 |  And he's got the Koskis away here into the penalty area and
[4383.06 - 4385.06] P:1663.62 E:0.107982 |  Conspiracy made a terrific challenge
[4385.78 - 4390.30] P:1812.42 E:0.100529 |  To get back to the Latvian striker and it had to be a well-timed challenge
[4390.34 - 4397.18] P:1617.14 E:0.097804 |  Otherwise he really runs the risk of giving away a penalty and it was exactly that I got it absolutely spot on
[4398.18 - 4402.50] P:1463.96 E:0.089138 |  Brilliant tackle from Condor and he has to come a kind of wraps himself around
[4403.14 - 4408.06] P:1534.56 E:0.090073 |  The player as well to win the ball because if he goes straight for the ball it ended up going through the player first
[4408.06 - 4413.58] P:1468.72 E:0.089044 |  So he has to kind of run at a good yard or so a little bit wider and past him in order to make that tackle
[4414.18 - 4416.10] P:1425.35 E:0.094182 |  Just nearly got caught out there a little bit
[4416.14 - 4421.38] P:1392.65 E:0.099188 |  I think he expected Anderson to keep hold of the ball in midfield it got taken and then we were a little bit exposed
[4421.90 - 4423.90] P:1508.51 E:0.101412 |  Well here he is now again
[4424.30 - 4427.38] P:1716.23 E:0.103896 |  Ladislav Skokoskis on the right-hand side
[4427.86 - 4433.86] P:1583.81 E:0.110956 |  Riggles away from one challenge and then he shoots left-footed and that had the Latvian supporters
[4434.38 - 4439.14] P:1711.16 E:0.110873 |  Giving a little bit of an ooh and an ah because they haven't had much to it get excited about tonight
[4439.14 - 4444.34] P:1724.24 E:0.099890 |  He scored his first international goal in three years in that 2-2 draw against that Andorra
[4444.46 - 4446.54] P:1485.30 E:0.089279 |  He only had one thing on his mind there
[4446.54 - 4452.78] P:1571.62 E:0.089018 |  But it flashed away off his left boot and it's gone out for a goal kick that would have been a spectacular goal
[4452.78 - 4457.46] P:1478.33 E:0.090678 |  It would I mean it was a fair way wide. I'm just looking at the replay the concert tackles a brilliant tackle
[4458.02 - 4460.58] P:1443.94 E:0.098583 |  It really is he gets around the player
[4462.70 - 4468.24] P:1423.91 E:0.093996 |  Really good technical tackle goes to ground but very measured from concert really good recovery
[4468.96 - 4476.20] P:1582.97 E:0.084471 |  This is England's first visit to Terega they met had met for the first time back in March where England went by three goals
[4476.20 - 4478.20] P:1504.74 E:0.066501 |  to know that Wembley but in fact
[4478.80 - 4481.64] P:1497.53 E:0.096398 |  None of the the Baltic nations have actually
[4482.16 - 4484.56] P:1780.26 E:0.100873 |  scored a goal against England Estonia
[4485.08 - 4491.00] P:1662.68 E:0.091200 |  played for loss for Lithuania likewise they've conceded nine and ten goals respectively
[4491.44 - 4497.32] P:1449.50 E:0.089048 |  So not only could Kukovsky's there had had his become the first Latvian goalscorer for the
[4498.44 - 4501.32] P:1587.22 E:0.103399 |  Baltic nations he might have created his own little bit of
[4501.84 - 4505.28] P:1517.21 E:0.085824 |  History here 11 minutes into the second half in these wet
[4506.08 - 4507.20] P:1660.50 E:0.085323 |  conditions
[4507.20 - 4513.56] P:1516.09 E:0.089219 |  There's England with that with concert trotting his way in towards the to the center circle
[4514.84 - 4517.52] P:1489.62 E:0.104088 |  And then passes the ball out towards Rice
[4520.32 - 4526.76] P:1434.19 E:0.087260 |  Anderson lifts the ball over the top looking for Gordon Gordon will get there it was unable to be
[4527.52 - 4534.76] P:1405.53 E:0.094315 |  Kept out there by Tony sets ball into the air Rice brings it down effortlessly controls it Anderson spent

[4538.40 - 4542.00] P:1632.01 E:0.103332 |  Ganiak's snapping away at his heels, but Sacher towards Spence
[4543.44 - 4545.44] P:1623.87 E:0.093524 |  Forward ball Rogers
[4546.20 - 4550.32] P:1384.23 E:0.097811 |  Rice wants it Rice gets it receives it now from Rogers
[4551.12 - 4554.92] P:1393.66 E:0.107411 |  Looking then for Lewis Skelly on the the overlap for Spain
[4555.40 - 4560.56] P:1346.16 E:0.099888 |  And now leading Bulgaria 2-0 Arsenault's Mikhail Marino has got that one and
[4560.96 - 4567.84] P:1460.43 E:0.094771 |  Serbia have come from behind and Dora one Serbia 2 is the latest score in England's group group K
[4569.28 - 4570.64] P:1140.75 E:0.080288 |  England
[4570.64 - 4572.64] P:1598.11 E:0.099181 |  Still yet to concede incidentally
[4573.36 - 4576.00] P:1474.94 E:0.101224 |  Looking for the sixth straight winning group K
[4577.00 - 4579.00] P:1176.57 E:0.075162 |  There from
[4580.44 - 4583.04] P:1569.01 E:0.091090 |  Jed spent with a cross from the right hand side
[4583.04 - 4588.56] P:1472.57 E:0.100392 |  And it's any the England fans that end of the ground just goes to show the the confidence of the young man
[4588.56 - 4590.56] P:1474.64 E:0.078181 |  And what is only his third appearance?
[4591.36 - 4596.20] P:1399.03 E:0.090841 |  Rogers had made a good run off the ball there and Anderson couldn't find him as he ran into the inside right channel instead
[4596.20 - 4598.20] P:1443.57 E:0.077905 |  They go out towards Gordon
[4598.48 - 4600.24] P:1185.04 E:0.062479 |  Gordon
[4600.24 - 4603.04] P:1525.66 E:0.098441 |  Spence wants it and also have the option of concert
[4603.44 - 4605.92] P:1578.96 E:0.102962 |  Committing white shirts forward now out towards
[4606.44 - 4613.24] P:1531.63 E:0.105817 |  Sacher Sacher has Saganics in front of him rolls it back Spence first cross with pace and the goalkeeper struggling there
[4616.00 - 4618.48] P:1534.49 E:0.120488 |  And I think he's gonna go down as an own goal
[4619.12 - 4625.40] P:1544.03 E:0.101308 |  England get their fourth goal and a more than well on their way now to the World Cup next summer
[4626.84 - 4632.32] P:1523.86 E:0.107027 |  For me that was all about the pace of the ball Spence the delivery Saganics, I think might have been the unfortunate player
[4632.32 - 4636.84] P:1345.73 E:0.099241 |  Yeah, I think the goalkeeper doesn't cover himself in glory because if you're gonna come for that ball
[4637.08 - 4641.48] P:1471.46 E:0.091901 |  You've got to get more of a touch on it than he does. I mean the delivery super
[4641.84 - 4645.52] P:1393.46 E:0.088988 |  Saka sets it back. It's whipped first time from Spence. It's a nice height
[4645.52 - 4649.78] P:1413.68 E:0.085126 |  But the goalkeeper comes to deal with it and he just flaps it
[4649.78 - 4654.72] P:1460.00 E:0.102415 |  It really doesn't get any kind of contact and then he just puts his defender right in trouble because it ends up
[4655.24 - 4656.60] P:1513.37 E:0.082480 |  Just coming off the boot
[4656.60 - 4660.76] P:1389.52 E:0.097115 |  I mean how that squeaks into the back post because he's a good two or three yards
[4661.08 - 4663.44] P:1474.53 E:0.090578 |  Further back outside of the back post
[4664.08 - 4666.88] P:1489.00 E:0.097143 |  But it just hits him in the shins spins up in the air
[4667.32 - 4673.48] P:1433.81 E:0.090002 |  Agonizingly and just creeps inside that back post this it's a poor piece of goalkeeping that and now here all of a sudden
[4673.48 - 4678.52] P:1676.21 E:0.101494 |  Without fourth goal Thomas Tugel without any hesitation is gonna make a raft of changes
[4678.52 - 4684.08] P:1594.86 E:0.100120 |  We're gonna see Jordan Henderson Jared Bowen and ever reach it as a coming on Declan Rice is
[4684.64 - 4686.64] P:1754.61 E:0.093389 |  Is coming off as well
[4687.44 - 4689.44] P:1586.21 E:0.099276 |  So Henderson comes on for Declan Rice
[4689.88 - 4692.72] P:1615.14 E:0.094990 |  Gets a pat on the back and a hearty slap as well
[4692.72 - 4696.48] P:1713.77 E:0.092465 |  It was from Thomas Tugel. Rogers is coming off for Jared Bowen
[4697.12 - 4703.36] P:1610.81 E:0.094508 |  And there's almost the high fives there for Thomas Tugel to greet the PFA young player of the year
[4703.36 - 4707.68] P:1606.47 E:0.090889 |  And then Saka is also coming off as well. So they're the changes that England have made Matt
[4707.68 - 4712.00] P:1621.90 E:0.083947 |  Yeah, it makes total sense doesn't it? I mean if I'm honest that you could have subbed them, you know
[4712.00 - 4716.72] P:1499.49 E:0.096956 |  And anytime even at halftime because the game's wrapped up at halftime for sure
[4717.52 - 4719.52] P:1315.13 E:0.105553 |  But I think the plan is for
[4720.04 - 4721.24] P:1340.72 E:0.107053 |  To do it on an hour
[4721.24 - 4723.64] P:1260.84 E:0.104801 |  So you stick to the plan because the plan's working well
[4723.92 - 4729.68] P:1257.53 E:0.103768 |  And it makes sense to give these players an opportunity to get on the pitch and get to the rhythm and play in the team
[4729.72 - 4737.00] P:1521.59 E:0.100003 |  And also to rest those players that have been playing a lot of minutes Turkey for Georgian Nill is a latest scoring group E
[4738.00 - 4744.20] P:1424.81 E:0.107428 |  So England and Portugal are going to be the latest teams to qualify for the World Cup as it currently stands
[4744.56 - 4747.52] P:1439.62 E:0.106373 |  There's Gordon keeps the ball in play on that left hand side
[4748.40 - 4750.40] P:1288.33 E:0.093961 |  darts down the byline
[4751.24 - 4753.24] P:1457.92 E:0.114160 |  That's the ball back to Lewis Skelly
[4753.48 - 4761.12] P:1584.56 E:0.090799 |  And then Henderson will get a touch as well Jordan Henderson who's making his 87th appearance for England tonight and then Gordon
[4762.00 - 4768.68] P:1564.79 E:0.107062 |  Rattles the board hard off the shins of us lavender and behind it will go for a corner kick England 4-0 up
[4769.20 - 4773.26] P:1423.09 E:0.106731 |  61 minutes play. Yes, nice opportunity to work on these set plays as well
[4773.48 - 4780.32] P:1425.41 E:0.095503 |  So said beforehand is hugely important leading into a major tournament getting organized being a threat. I think we have been in
[4780.88 - 4787.24] P:1464.01 E:0.093268 |  This game certainly with the delivery from Declan Rice is is generally spot on is really inviting balls
[4787.24 - 4789.24] P:1346.50 E:0.087463 |  But this one's a little bit different all the players
[4789.52 - 4793.92] P:1402.02 E:0.090952 |  I've literally just crowded the goal line in and around the goalkeeper and it's an
[4794.76 - 4801.92] P:1571.05 E:0.101970 |  In swinging right footed corner as a clips it across and it's caused confusion in the Latvian defense and they quickly turn the ball behind
[4802.68 - 4806.40] P:1671.27 E:0.092347 |  Ever each year Ezzer once again wanders across in front of those
[4806.84 - 4810.84] P:1571.31 E:0.092656 |  Trees that line that far side there must be what 20 of them
[4811.52 - 4813.52] P:1492.71 E:0.093848 |  till you till your trees
[4813.92 - 4816.48] P:1505.04 E:0.107467 |  large-leaved line nice in that they are
[4817.64 - 4818.64] P:1084.21 E:0.085644 |  Yeah
[4818.64 - 4820.00] P:1374.57 E:0.080990 |  there's
[4820.00 - 4825.64] P:1634.48 E:0.090769 |  As a weights once again with another corner kick what an extremely congested six yard area
[4825.64 - 4827.52] P:1740.43 E:0.102392 |  This is stones rises in the air
[4827.52 - 4833.08] P:1570.98 E:0.104604 |  But if a scramble Gordon with a turn and shot blocked and the ball is cleared away by Sagan Yix
[4833.92 - 4840.20] P:1730.76 E:0.094232 |  I think actually the the own goal came off the rather unfortunate substitute Tony sets
[4840.84 - 4845.98] P:1629.59 E:0.083755 |  Rather than Sagan Yix for that that fourth goal from the Spence Cross
[4846.74 - 4848.34] P:1336.67 E:0.042014 |  as
[4848.34 - 4852.06] P:1713.21 E:0.101918 |  England qualifying in some style with two games to spare
[4852.34 - 4854.86] P:1546.85 E:0.089087 |  When I said by the way about this stadium on social media
[4854.86 - 4858.62] P:1608.51 E:0.085211 |  I said one last night I came out just before Jordan Pickford and I took a little
[4860.26 - 4864.30] P:1418.66 E:0.108491 |  Panoramic view of the entire stadium and I said something along the lines of one of the more unusual
[4865.38 - 4867.22] P:1600.08 E:0.086771 |  international venues
[4867.22 - 4871.18] P:1535.50 E:0.110486 |  Don't think has been well received by a few in in Riga
[4871.62 - 4878.10] P:1501.85 E:0.093005 |  One content creator is that what they call them these days? Okay? She said this is hardly a compliment
[4878.22 - 4883.54] P:1453.26 E:0.087781 |  She actually said it in Latvian right so I responded saying it wasn't meant to be
[4883.94 - 4887.82] P:1364.78 E:0.090496 |  criticism either no I responded in Latvia to that did you I did I
[4888.26 - 4892.50] P:1405.22 E:0.100847 |  Didn't know you could what might you always do tend to try and get a bit of the native?
[4892.50 - 4894.62] P:1457.57 E:0.101347 |  Well, I needed that I needed Google translate
[4894.62 - 4897.94] P:1300.65 E:0.091080 |  I'm just impressed that you knew what trees they work to go. I didn't know you were
[4898.38 - 4900.38] P:1170.26 E:0.085103 |  That green finger dinner well
[4900.70 - 4906.18] P:1416.10 E:0.094634 |  I'm slightly better being green figure than I'm with a medical being an expert when I said to Danny Ward last week about
[4906.82 - 4908.82] P:1353.61 E:0.091373 |  That was the shoulder. It was his elbow
[4910.30 - 4913.26] P:1393.52 E:0.100608 |  But here is a as a crossing the ball back
[4914.82 - 4918.02] P:1379.29 E:0.105544 |  Now Anderson well, I've got to confess I did I did need it
[4918.02 - 4925.14] P:1393.39 E:0.100615 |  I've got an app that I use in my garden and I used it to identify which trees they were to did you I did yeah
[4925.30 - 4927.30] P:1486.02 E:0.112288 |  I'm getting down with the technology
[4930.58 - 4932.50] P:1553.76 E:0.121471 |  63 minutes played the answer to that is no
[4932.50 - 4938.26] P:1578.85 E:0.108145 |  Now it's in his winners Connor Cody back in the studio on air until 10 30 then Tony Livesey takes through
[4938.66 - 4945.70] P:1466.26 E:0.101118 |  We'll have more football for you tomorrow night the Champions League game between Chelsea and Paris and of course the Premier League is back at the weekend
[4946.98 - 4950.26] P:1686.60 E:0.104592 |  Manchester City Everton at 3 full of Arsenal at 5 30 and
[4951.18 - 4957.82] P:1561.97 E:0.103025 |  Then on Sunday Tottenham Aston Villa as Ezra shoots first time could say by the goal key. He's Idris was down low
[4958.82 - 4963.10] P:1600.10 E:0.104502 |  Had to react very very quickly away to his right to keep out as his first time left
[4963.10 - 4968.04] P:1576.64 E:0.087726 |  But it's shot England almost close to a fifth goal Liverpool Manchester United just to finish off that
[4969.22 - 4975.86] P:1472.60 E:0.102153 |  Vocal trail for a weekend offering Matt. Yeah, really good from England again. It's just picking Latvia off at will
[4976.54 - 4980.42] P:1345.96 E:0.105663 |  The game's dead and buried in terms of the outcome England have sealed this
[4981.10 - 4986.30] P:1306.41 E:0.106419 |  match comfortably, but it's about how they conduct themselves now all the way through and
[4986.90 - 4992.06] P:1375.93 E:0.111745 |  Thomas Tuka will keep an eye on everyone. Nobody's slacking off. Nobody taking it easy
[4992.90 - 4998.50] P:1427.76 E:0.101538 |  Maintaining the standards and they're doing that really well. You just feel there's gonna be probably more goals to come in this game
[4998.50 - 5000.14] P:1198.66 E:0.096038 |  There's still a fair old way to go
[5000.14 - 5002.82] P:1365.10 E:0.102857 |  There is we're not even midway through the second half yet
[5002.82 - 5008.78] P:1565.42 E:0.100922 |  But England already leading by four goals to nil was hardy souls getting absolutely soaked
[5009.26 - 5014.38] P:1249.31 E:0.103656 |  Round two and a half thousand high up away towards our right-hand side as Gordon on the left
[5014.90 - 5017.38] P:1546.82 E:0.099053 |  Daskevic waits to come on Edwards Daskevic
[5017.94 - 5021.18] P:1359.02 E:0.105085 |  He moved to outer a Latvian club in the in the summer
[5021.18 - 5027.18] P:1387.68 E:0.095959 |  It'll be his 22nd Latvian appearance out of the last 25 internationals. This here is Ezra
[5028.22 - 5033.22] P:1530.63 E:0.110505 |  Latvia though still defending in numbers as a forward towards spent spent for the low ball in the goalkeeper
[5033.46 - 5037.38] P:1541.89 E:0.110785 |  Gathers it in safely as he falls to the ground inside his six yard area
[5037.62 - 5042.18] P:1509.72 E:0.104206 |  Spencer's been good at that tonight. Yeah, how old is he time that then at the time of the run was perfect
[5042.18 - 5044.38] P:1649.49 E:0.109420 |  He saw the situation read it and he went really early
[5044.74 - 5050.78] P:1393.35 E:0.104769 |  Was fan with the past puts the ball in the right channel just didn't have anyone running across the face of the defender
[5051.62 - 5054.22] P:1553.98 E:0.116847 |  Anderson picks up the ball drives forward
[5054.86 - 5061.34] P:1564.32 E:0.111359 |  Head to the area looks for Jared Bowen and then it required the intervention from Sagan Yix just to get there and actually avoid the
[5061.58 - 5068.62] P:1493.61 E:0.111216 |  leaping goalkeeper who was diving in his own feet of his own player to clear the ball away as the rain drives down with even more
[5068.90 - 5073.50] P:1475.19 E:0.105125 |  Intensity now and in fact the change is going to be Varslavans coming off and Daskevic
[5073.50 - 5079.66] P:1477.98 E:0.103960 |  She's going to be coming on that is like for like just a fresh pair of legs in the midfield for some tired
[5079.66 - 5086.02] P:1412.83 E:0.102479 |  Bodies for this Latvian side that are looking rather be draggled in the rain. Yeah, I mean they have done for quite some time
[5086.54 - 5090.50] P:1490.73 E:0.110173 |  They've really been struggling physically to get to grips with this England team who look
[5091.38 - 5094.26] P:1449.39 E:0.109397 |  Exact opposite. I must say they look bright. We look sharp
[5094.90 - 5100.22] P:1428.99 E:0.095651 |  Plenty of energy in the team. I think physically the squad in as a whole is in a very good place at the moment
[5101.58 - 5104.92] P:1645.15 E:0.106254 |  You can see puddles starting to form on the athletics track
[5105.66 - 5107.66] P:1337.96 E:0.085942 |  in in front of us
[5108.58 - 5115.26] P:1393.83 E:0.098058 |  Incidentally a Guinness World Record was set here in 2008 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the independence of
[5115.70 - 5118.46] P:1486.50 E:0.098335 |  Latvia is bowing on this right-hand side
[5118.70 - 5124.70] P:1414.53 E:0.099249 |  Just to cut inside off his left foot well well wide a goal kick going then it was the most recorded
[5126.42 - 5131.78] P:1546.41 E:0.095671 |  3800 and seven people the most recorded ran out in a 100 meter in a 24-hour relay
[5132.54 - 5138.30] P:1630.97 E:0.093028 |  Why they didn't wait until 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary for the 100 meters now
[5138.30 - 5141.34] P:1579.57 E:0.095313 |  I've had a bit of symmetry about it. Would it not it would have made much more sense
[5141.58 - 5144.22] P:1363.03 E:0.084176 |  But what's the that they just ran it consecutive? Yeah
[5145.02 - 5147.02] P:1495.36 E:0.099257 |  20 for 24 hours
[5147.14 - 5149.14] P:1424.38 E:0.076666 |  3800 and seven
[5150.26 - 5151.62] P:1215.05 E:0.053968 |  But
[5151.62 - 5152.90] P:1211.12 E:0.079985 |  that was
[5152.90 - 5154.46] P:1305.70 E:0.089482 |  some time ago
[5154.46 - 5156.58] P:1344.18 E:0.120195 |  I feel as if they've done a lot of running tonight
[5157.02 - 5162.58] P:1591.04 E:0.105190 |  Seganics is on herring after this ball and he continues to pursue it Jordan Pickford comes out of his penalty area
[5163.14 - 5169.70] P:1541.20 E:0.098392 |  Plays the ball out of play quickly back in position as Latvia take the throw quickly on the left-hand side
[5170.26 - 5174.90] P:1529.28 E:0.109719 |  People just delighted to be involved in the game. Yeah, a rare touch and comes across
[5175.90 - 5178.34] P:1482.45 E:0.117372 |  Like for here for the substitute
[5178.98 - 5186.38] P:1614.31 E:0.103442 |  Why from Tony Sam's right foot it took any flex on its way through and that will go out of play for a corner kick
[5186.38 - 5190.62] P:1620.11 E:0.093232 |  They haven't had a couple of moments in this second half. Yes. Yeah good effort
[5191.34 - 5193.34] P:1536.69 E:0.102066 |  Really nice effort with the right foot
[5193.58 - 5196.10] P:1616.33 E:0.106497 |  It comes all the way across to the right-hand side
[5197.42 - 5203.58] P:1531.82 E:0.105532 |  Clicked out to the edge of the box and it's a first-time effort strikes it really cleanly actually zips off the turf and just wide
[5204.10 - 5206.58] P:1593.28 E:0.108387 |  Defection on the way through played the corner short
[5207.14 - 5210.30] P:1635.97 E:0.110048 |  Pickford makes the save and then the acrobatic effort is well off target
[5210.42 - 5216.38] P:1802.50 E:0.100855 |  But Dashek which certainly caught hold of that left foot in and Jordan Pickford then was called into action for his first save
[5216.38 - 5219.54] P:1732.77 E:0.100060 |  And he earned his money as well in would lead by four goals to nil
[5219.54 - 5224.14] P:1727.97 E:0.087939 |  They're on their way to qualify for the World Cup and he and out to take you through as small
[5224.46 - 5230.12] P:1715.79 E:0.088967 |  Substitutions are in the offing is a substitution of our own John Murray. Yes, it's going to be Dan Bern
[5230.16 - 5236.40] P:1616.78 E:0.086870 |  Who's going to come on next for England just wandering up to the side of the pitch across the the damp
[5236.88 - 5241.04] P:1654.29 E:0.094034 |  Running track, but Jordan Pickford will feel that he's contributed after that
[5241.44 - 5247.92] P:1663.42 E:0.085582 |  Sharp save wasn't it? It was a well struck shot by Dashek of it and he parried it away
[5248.44 - 5252.48] P:1578.47 E:0.092642 |  A little bit like the Wales game the other night when he had to make a couple of saves in the second half and
[5252.60 - 5255.92] P:1668.45 E:0.093979 |  And did so well England at the other end now with a chance which
[5256.48 - 5261.76] P:1503.13 E:0.090736 |  Anderson shoots that's blocked across the penalty area. Born can't get there and it bounces down for
[5262.24 - 5269.64] P:1542.06 E:0.094566 |  Latvia and cleared up Jordan Henderson stretching just got his head to it and was able to with that glance take it back to John
[5269.64 - 5278.44] P:1649.22 E:0.102013 |  Stones. Yes, Jordan Henderson's 87th cap tonight John Stones 85th now here is Jed Spence on the right-hand side
[5279.32 - 5281.32] P:1450.61 E:0.095220 |  As
[5281.76 - 5286.12] P:1489.28 E:0.106555 |  Elliot Anderson was was quite heavily challenged from behind
[5286.72 - 5293.68] P:1627.38 E:0.101691 |  By Dashek of it, but England still with it as they play from left to right the home supporters as you can hear despite the
[5294.08 - 5295.68] P:1736.71 E:0.104092 |  4-0 scoreline
[5295.68 - 5302.32] P:1552.38 E:0.088549 |  Have turned up the volume and still lots of empty seats in the England section as Ian was describing
[5302.60 - 5305.64] P:1436.79 E:0.089770 |  Many of the England fans have come down and are watching from ground level
[5306.16 - 5310.80] P:1628.74 E:0.082665 |  From underneath the stand peering through through the metal fences
[5310.80 - 5313.48] P:1652.68 E:0.081673 |  I'm sure there'll be pictures of that because the
[5314.16 - 5319.56] P:1520.97 E:0.097713 |  All the photographers are at this end of the ground. They won't have missed that opportunity here Spence does well beats his man
[5319.56 - 5321.80] P:1508.96 E:0.098021 |  then comes back onto his right foot and
[5322.60 - 5327.92] P:1439.57 E:0.111837 |  And now with the bull stationary on the ground Spence a little swivel of the hips
[5328.20 - 5333.48] P:1565.08 E:0.106054 |  Jordan Henderson wins the throw into the deflection level with the edge of the Latvia penalty area
[5333.48 - 5335.48] P:1627.99 E:0.111256 |  We're going to see Marcus Rashford as well
[5335.48 - 5340.16] P:1505.26 E:0.098442 |  So burn and Rashford are going to come on and that is it
[5340.16 - 5343.20] P:1563.08 E:0.108906 |  Anthony Gordon on the night that he scored his second goal for England
[5343.20 - 5348.56] P:1646.17 E:0.108197 |  He opened the scoring for England this evening and Marcus Rashford on loan with Barcelona
[5348.80 - 5351.68] P:1629.98 E:0.114643 |  But judging by what Thomas Tuchel was saying the other evening
[5352.08 - 5354.08] P:1576.63 E:0.105574 |  You know he's got work to do
[5354.48 - 5360.48] P:1652.62 E:0.103675 |  To make sure of his place in the England squad and Gordon comes often well again Matt. Yeah
[5361.32 - 5367.36] P:1424.68 E:0.103687 |  Really really pleased with Anthony Gordon. I thought he had an excellent game worked hard
[5367.84 - 5371.28] P:1518.19 E:0.099453 |  Looked like he was going to create good balls in the box got his goal
[5371.28 - 5376.44] P:1398.48 E:0.097101 |  And I think just up in those numbers just getting that goal and assist have been more
[5376.88 - 5379.84] P:1497.99 E:0.091693 |  Reward for the work that he does is going to take him to the next level
[5381.00 - 5384.40] P:1545.55 E:0.094493 |  And John Stones evening is all about as well and
[5385.40 - 5389.12] P:1393.83 E:0.115072 |  Dan Berners come on to replace him the new Castleman winning his
[5389.52 - 5395.76] P:1730.50 E:0.100098 |  fourth cap for England after making his debut being the surprise selection in Thomas Tuchel's first squad
[5395.80 - 5399.72] P:1789.37 E:0.084277 |  He's been a part of the whole thing throughout the now eight matches
[5399.76 - 5401.88] P:1589.92 E:0.082354 |  And as I say winning his fourth cap tonight
[5401.92 - 5406.08] P:1708.65 E:0.087671 |  Here is Rashford into the action for the first time black gloves on then plays it back
[5406.08 - 5410.64] P:1725.45 E:0.089362 |  Henderson works it to the left-hand side in comes the cross from Lewis Skelly
[5410.64 - 5417.72] P:1429.63 E:0.101375 |  Which is deflected behind for another England corner. I must say when Marcus Rashford is able to shift that ball inside onto his right foot
[5418.36 - 5421.04] P:1391.02 E:0.107781 |  When he hits that ball John, it's like an absolute rocket
[5421.04 - 5425.24] P:1558.31 E:0.101476 |  Isn't it has horrible movement on it for the goalkeeper if he can manufacture that half a yard
[5425.48 - 5431.00] P:1519.35 E:0.100100 |  Is one of the best in the business at hitting that right foot shot coming inside the pitch and he looks for it every time
[5431.80 - 5437.16] P:1609.24 E:0.090888 |  So that's five substitutions, isn't it for England now? Yep, and as that will take this corner
[5437.60 - 5441.80] P:1754.61 E:0.090553 |  From over there on the far side almost in the shadow of those trees
[5442.16 - 5446.62] P:1647.38 E:0.101365 |  Flag post behind him the flags hanging limply and one of those massive
[5447.12 - 5454.24] P:1527.25 E:0.101077 |  Gray floodlight pilots towering all for him there and the lamps on it. There must be 25 lamps on that
[5454.24 - 5458.36] P:1394.36 E:0.104216 |  It's not more of the world. It is it is. It's exactly what it's like
[5459.16 - 5464.60] P:1539.65 E:0.101725 |  So a bit of HG Wells in Riga and a packed penalty area again
[5464.60 - 5470.44] P:1674.68 E:0.102266 |  They are crowding the goalkeeper as a is just going to drop this in which he does now to the near post and it's headed away
[5470.72 - 5472.36] P:1492.81 E:0.074067 |  for Latvia
[5472.36 - 5479.28] P:1518.97 E:0.091766 |  For nail England lead and on their way to confirming that place at the World Cup next summer and
[5481.08 - 5483.08] P:1397.10 E:0.096592 |  We are going to see changes
[5483.56 - 5485.56] P:1265.15 E:0.096535 |  two more for
[5485.60 - 5487.00] P:1395.95 E:0.063809 |  Latvia
[5487.00 - 5493.08] P:1565.47 E:0.086250 |  Turkey now winning for one against Georgia and good good Koskis the number nine is
[5494.36 - 5499.32] P:1484.67 E:0.093992 |  Is going to be replaced by the number 20 Marco Rigsha
[5499.68 - 5504.68] P:1501.97 E:0.096443 |  Who's winning his will winners 14th cap up front and
[5506.56 - 5508.56] P:1273.43 E:0.123220 |  Also leaving the field
[5510.60 - 5514.92] P:1385.57 E:0.099984 |  Lucas Vapna in the midfield with
[5517.32 - 5519.32] P:1418.93 E:0.109682 |  Coming on in the field
[5520.64 - 5523.40] P:1639.46 E:0.077625 |  Savalyevs into the midfield Alexi
[5524.40 - 5532.56] P:1425.34 E:0.101601 |  Savalyevs who started against Andorra here at the weekend and is now pitch the number 22
[5534.68 - 5536.68] P:1399.89 E:0.103085 |  Savalyevs
[5536.72 - 5543.40] P:1569.86 E:0.104274 |  So if you just switched onto us on five live England on the way to confirming qualification with two matches to spare
[5543.68 - 5545.04] P:1092.56 E:0.079407 |  Anthony Gordon
[5545.04 - 5550.52] P:1676.44 E:0.093903 |  Scoring the first goal in the first half two goals from Harry Kane the second of a penalty just before the break and then the
[5550.80 - 5552.80] P:1506.68 E:0.072369 |  Tony says own goal
[5553.44 - 5557.04] P:1487.46 E:0.087704 |  In the second half and England have not let up
[5557.76 - 5559.76] P:1495.34 E:0.081404 |  Which you wouldn't expect them to do
[5560.24 - 5562.16] P:1302.71 E:0.093570 |  It's easily done though, John, isn't it?
[5562.16 - 5568.64] P:1300.01 E:0.086332 |  I know we're not expecting it because of the mindset they're at but it's very easy to take your foot off the gas in these kind of
[5568.76 - 5573.72] P:1306.53 E:0.096447 |  Situations and you're right that they really haven't done England that played with the same purpose and same quality
[5575.16 - 5578.08] P:1414.48 E:0.109471 |  And consa works it to the right-hand side Jed spends
[5578.64 - 5582.34] P:1544.68 E:0.092275 |  starting as the right back with Lewis Skelly at left back
[5583.44 - 5586.52] P:1674.95 E:0.110728 |  So the the full backs who did so well in Serbia
[5586.92 - 5593.08] P:1637.22 E:0.100516 |  Lefremento and Rhys James ruled out of this but Spence and Lewis Skelly have not done themselves any harm and Spence now to
[5593.08 - 5595.52] P:1564.51 E:0.097628 |  Born, Born pulls it back but the captain
[5595.88 - 5601.52] P:1585.19 E:0.102901 |  Shenemore East was there to steer it behind for another corner for England this time from the right-hand side
[5602.52 - 5607.16] P:1321.58 E:0.111678 |  Got that really good energy now in wide air is bowing on this near side on the right
[5607.88 - 5612.96] P:1543.16 E:0.107087 |  Looking to make an impression drive at the defenders who are looking a little bit tired and not really
[5613.60 - 5615.60] P:1431.76 E:0.089984 |  You know in in that physical
[5616.04 - 5621.34] P:1546.47 E:0.096314 |  Sharpness that he's in having just come off on the bench. I mean he could really exploit that situation
[5622.04 - 5627.80] P:1484.23 E:0.096607 |  Baricet as they mix his way to this side and raises a left arm as that takes the corner
[5627.80 - 5631.48] P:1673.99 E:0.110840 |  Which is a low one and it is struck low by Harry Kane
[5631.68 - 5636.88] P:1728.00 E:0.089753 |  And that's a that's a decent stop actually through a crowd of players kept out then it's in from born
[5636.88 - 5643.96] P:1682.89 E:0.082848 |  That's hooked away on the edge of the six-yard box by Tony chefs comes back to England again as a
[5645.72 - 5651.24] P:1574.19 E:0.087310 |  Drifting infield and then clipping it with his left in step to Elliot Anderson now
[5651.24 - 5654.84] P:1534.22 E:0.098993 |  He has Rashford Rashford's ball into the box bounces down and
[5655.96 - 5657.96] P:1429.09 E:0.087823 |  Stretching for it in there
[5657.96 - 5659.44] P:1149.34 E:0.090153 |  Dan Byrne
[5659.44 - 5662.56] P:1534.23 E:0.103050 |  Just slightly behind him up for the set piece
[5663.00 - 5668.48] P:1515.82 E:0.104921 |  And it is cleared away to the halfway line and Republic of Ireland have taken the lead against Armenia
[5668.76 - 5673.26] P:1543.06 E:0.096664 |  Evan Ferguson with the the golds been a wretched campaign for the Irish
[5673.26 - 5678.92] P:1455.04 E:0.099723 |  But winning 1l against Armenia Portugal still 2-1 up on Hungary last we heard
[5679.60 - 5685.60] P:1470.97 E:0.095341 |  Portugal have the chance tonight like England to clinch their place at the at the World Cup England
[5685.92 - 5687.92] P:1570.14 E:0.099005 |  continuing to press forward
[5688.16 - 5694.68] P:1371.79 E:0.101953 |  With Jordan Henderson receiving it back and actually going all the way back towards the halfway line
[5694.68 - 5700.12] P:1518.68 E:0.105532 |  So they're gonna do it tonight Matt with two matches to play Thomas took a like liking what he's saying
[5700.12 - 5702.72] P:1731.43 E:0.099850 |  He's just raising a clenched fist there
[5702.72 - 5706.48] P:1664.68 E:0.109442 |  He's got a blue book baseball cap and a padded jacket on will hear from him
[5706.48 - 5712.60] P:1509.49 E:0.092046 |  I would think on five lives before 10 30 this evening will have the live interviews from the tunnel
[5712.60 - 5715.72] P:1508.10 E:0.101870 |  You'll hear them all on the football daily podcast on the BBC sounds out
[5716.00 - 5721.02] P:1513.01 E:0.099014 |  Rashford does well beats his man left for it cross comes off a lap in head as I hit the shot that was that was
[5721.20 - 5726.94] P:1450.29 E:0.105851 |  Miss hit actually and easily cleared away, but England take up possession again near the halfway line
[5726.94 - 5731.84] P:1347.58 E:0.084099 |  Somebody puts up a red umbrella just down in front of us even though the rain has eased
[5731.84 - 5734.34] P:1367.05 E:0.087867 |  it was torrential at one point and
[5735.20 - 5739.98] P:1445.65 E:0.094789 |  It's not the coldest night it has to be said even though we're so close to the Baltic sea
[5740.18 - 5746.66] P:1419.36 E:0.095761 |  It's it's not windy tonight and the wind that sweeps in off the Baltic sea has got a real edge to it
[5746.90 - 5749.46] P:1435.08 E:0.094936 |  As we discovered over the course of the last couple of days
[5749.94 - 5756.44] P:1482.70 E:0.102488 |  Boen and then Spence is dispossessed and Latvia breaking away down the left-hand side with Balodis
[5756.44 - 5758.44] P:1672.19 E:0.095618 |  the left-sided central defender but
[5758.94 - 5763.66] P:1391.09 E:0.094076 |  Spence is able to tackle back and it's out of play for a throw into England on the halfway line
[5763.66 - 5765.14] P:1517.68 E:0.093988 |  So Latvia nil
[5765.14 - 5768.94] P:1493.26 E:0.087323 |  England for under gareth southgate Matt
[5769.98 - 5776.46] P:1598.10 E:0.101940 |  The last qualification for euro 2024 gareth southgate side did it with two matches to spare
[5777.06 - 5783.86] P:1623.73 E:0.095389 |  For world cup 2022 it was done on the final night of group matches when they won 10 nil in San Marino
[5783.86 - 5786.38] P:1292.30 E:0.104242 |  I remember that well that was a dank night as well
[5787.58 - 5791.66] P:1516.73 E:0.085689 |  Euro 2020 it was done with one match to spare when they beat Montenegro in the
[5791.78 - 5795.30] P:1556.49 E:0.083019 |  1000th match this concept plays it forward towards
[5795.66 - 5797.66] P:1400.11 E:0.098220 |  Ezra but
[5808.50 - 5810.78] P:1165.11 E:0.111933 |  So it's a free kick near the right corner of the box
[5810.86 - 5816.20] P:1471.85 E:0.099597 |  Yeah, I think it was just a little bit late called as a as he told the ball away the tackle came in
[5816.70 - 5819.26] P:1427.67 E:0.109641 |  I think his foot went right on top of the Z's
[5820.10 - 5823.18] P:1463.12 E:0.105561 |  Didn't get any of the ball the referee just brought it back
[5825.30 - 5827.30] P:1504.18 E:0.094303 |  Real films the balmy is
[5829.94 - 5831.94] P:1511.28 E:0.079019 |  This is an X month about
[5832.70 - 5835.98] P:1599.18 E:0.104255 |  We need we need him with his knowledge of Latvia
[5836.74 - 5838.74] P:1565.13 E:0.098156 |  Get that those lights the attendance
[5840.06 - 5846.74] P:1657.15 E:0.089543 |  Spectators, thank you very much. So capacity for the Dalgava Stadium born with the free kick in
[5847.02 - 5853.46] P:1550.59 E:0.087565 |  Right across the face of goal beyond everyone and it's bouncing away the balls running away and it might hit one of those trees
[5853.58 - 5858.38] P:1778.50 E:0.079003 |  It's just rolled past the trunk of the one that's furthest right and out of sight
[5859.82 - 5861.82] P:1066.30 E:0.114624 |  That's a long way way as well
[5861.82 - 5863.82] P:1524.26 E:0.084191 |  There's a car park just behind us
[5864.06 - 5868.14] P:1433.63 E:0.102986 |  Spain 3 Bulgarian nil is the latest score there and
[5869.14 - 5872.22] P:1480.88 E:0.098475 |  And just to finish that off as Latvia break forward
[5872.22 - 5877.46] P:1593.79 E:0.100278 |  He has a ball through the middle for dash Kovic who's already had a chance now to the right-hand side and
[5879.02 - 5882.94] P:1467.69 E:0.101171 |  Latvia pouring bodies forward. I think four nil down
[5883.46 - 5885.14] P:1314.22 E:0.095101 |  I think it would be seen as a
[5885.14 - 5891.26] P:1636.98 E:0.101684 |  As a little success if they were able to register their first goal against England just the second meeting
[5891.54 - 5896.82] P:1416.96 E:0.099765 |  Between England and Latvia's men's senior teams remembering March England once 3 nil
[5897.22 - 5902.98] P:1553.48 E:0.101440 |  How he came scored in that one as well as those Reese James free kick remember that to open the scoring and
[5903.42 - 5906.94] P:1506.02 E:0.088729 |  Abirate as I scored his first goal for England in that match
[5906.94 - 5911.46] P:1406.76 E:0.095193 |  Latvia still with the ball inside the end half and then going back towards the the halfway line
[5911.46 - 5914.86] P:1550.19 E:0.087068 |  But the pass forward from Tony chefs will bounce all the way to
[5915.10 - 5920.42] P:1493.86 E:0.095683 |  Jordan Pickford who takes that easily Italy now 2 nil up on Israel trying to catch Norway
[5921.22 - 5924.66] P:1612.98 E:0.112903 |  Retevi has scored that one and Dora one Serbia 3 Mitrovic
[5925.06 - 5930.78] P:1560.39 E:0.089639 |  Scoring that goal after and Dora took an early lead. That's the other match in this group
[5931.42 - 5933.42] P:1328.89 E:0.068017 |  England next month
[5933.42 - 5939.14] P:1434.41 E:0.090977 |  With this scoreline will have matches against Serbia at Wembley and Albania in Tehran
[5939.14 - 5943.82] P:1497.65 E:0.082845 |  I had the final two qualifiers that will will really take on for England the
[5944.62 - 5946.42] P:1435.35 E:0.065705 |  the role of
[5946.42 - 5948.42] P:1622.90 E:0.107796 |  Tuning England up for the finals. Yes
[5949.50 - 5955.94] P:1544.84 E:0.090292 |  They're good games to have aren't they in terms of that, you know the pressure is off for qualification so you can really
[5956.66 - 5961.78] P:1479.52 E:0.091777 |  Start to use them as matches to hammer your messages home get the team set up keep
[5962.30 - 5965.66] P:1238.47 E:0.089768 |  You know picking whatever that team is that you want to play
[5966.38 - 5968.06] P:1255.35 E:0.086381 |  Which for me
[5968.06 - 5973.46] P:1451.14 E:0.105732 |  Again after this performance John, I shouldn't imagine he would make too many changes Thomas to you wouldn't have expected
[5973.46 - 5974.82] P:1421.97 E:0.103593 |  No
[5974.82 - 5977.78] P:1653.15 E:0.110168 |  It countings now the ball towards the edge of the penalty area
[5977.78 - 5983.54] P:1753.53 E:0.085595 |  But Berns able to step in and then he's challenged and he's felled and it's a free kick to England
[5983.54 - 5985.66] P:1692.14 E:0.089699 |  so Latvia nil England for and
[5986.38 - 5989.98] P:1623.85 E:0.097037 |  Just to go back to that Gerrard Southgate's first tournament for Wilk up 18
[5990.42 - 5993.18] P:1520.64 E:0.093402 |  England qualified with one match to spare so
[5993.98 - 6002.90] P:1626.37 E:0.091237 |  The last time they qualified with three matches to spare was Roy Hodgeson's ill-fated final tournament at Euro 2016
[6003.46 - 6004.66] P:1557.87 E:0.101814 |  so
[6004.66 - 6010.22] P:1473.45 E:0.082027 |  As ever it's not how you qualify. It's what you're doing the finals. Absolutely. However the
[6011.58 - 6012.58] P:1441.57 E:0.098677 |  Getting the job done
[6012.58 - 6018.66] P:1543.32 E:0.094072 |  I think is so important because England Thomas Tuchel the FA can then begin to really put their plans in place and
[6018.82 - 6025.14] P:1531.89 E:0.084992 |  Firm things up and also steal a march on on everyone else potentially. Yeah, I completely agree and
[6025.90 - 6027.58] P:1427.62 E:0.086840 |  and it will be
[6027.58 - 6029.58] P:1508.43 E:0.092786 |  using those games to really
[6029.86 - 6036.42] P:1481.23 E:0.091676 |  Get the team in that position where he wants them one now chasing after this ball that West Ham captain trying to hook it back
[6036.42 - 6040.94] P:1648.84 E:0.088235 |  It actually hits chair. No more days and bounces down for goalkeeper. Zvi Edris
[6041.42 - 6044.50] P:1677.24 E:0.098465 |  We'll have more England commentary for you tomorrow
[6045.26 - 6046.38] P:1481.87 E:0.079724 |  Incidentally
[6046.38 - 6052.34] P:1675.89 E:0.092637 |  At the women's cricket World Cup 10 15 in the morning England Pakistan live from our team in Colombo

[6059.10 - 6065.54] P:1656.52 E:0.091421 |  We heard from Vicki at halftime Vicki sparks. That'll be on five live sports tomorrow evening, but England
[6066.14 - 6069.78] P:1408.79 E:0.096241 |  winning handsomely here in the in the Riga rain and
[6070.66 - 6075.06] P:1781.34 E:0.113102 |  Rashford speeds away down the left-hand side takes it on towards the dead ball line pulls it across
[6075.06 - 6080.90] P:1691.62 E:0.094020 |  Low got that just as it reached the white line was able to pull it back that the falling chair and Mordy
[6080.90 - 6084.38] P:1567.85 E:0.089231 |  Put it behind for another England corner. I mean physically
[6084.42 - 6088.18] P:1533.53 E:0.092869 |  We've just been a couple of levels above this Latvia team this evening
[6088.18 - 6094.42] P:1356.14 E:0.092935 |  It stood out like a sore thumb the strength and the power and the pace of this England team is
[6094.70 - 6095.90] P:1431.65 E:0.059006 |  Is
[6095.90 - 6101.06] P:1525.63 E:0.099381 |  miles ahead of where that mirror and it just gets highlights certainly in those wide areas and
[6101.58 - 6103.62] P:1511.90 E:0.100271 |  Marcus Rashford really exploiting it there
[6103.86 - 6109.60] P:1673.17 E:0.099565 |  They're asking the England fans to remain seated for 25 minutes after the match corner has taken short
[6109.70 - 6112.30] P:1402.75 E:0.095331 |  Anderson drives it in but that's blocked inside the penalty area
[6112.50 - 6118.70] P:1646.99 E:0.087575 |  Anderson wins it back again and then a little ball to the edge of the box for conza back to Henderson
[6118.70 - 6125.66] P:1721.91 E:0.084018 |  His ball right across the penalty area that's worked across but it is cut out intercepted by pipes and
[6126.74 - 6128.74] P:1395.39 E:0.095955 |  Latvia are able to get it away
[6129.22 - 6131.46] P:1571.07 E:0.107000 |  25 minutes sitting in the pouring
[6132.74 - 6134.74] P:1304.91 E:0.076594 |  Latvian ring
[6135.14 - 6137.14] P:1547.61 E:0.073501 |  Doesn't particularly
[6137.30 - 6142.02] P:1400.68 E:0.098895 |  Appeal there's quite a lot of people making a move down to underneath the stand right now
[6142.02 - 6145.90] P:1368.58 E:0.089455 |  I should imagine everyone will be underneath here as opposed to yeah in the stand
[6146.34 - 6150.36] P:1490.46 E:0.094698 |  Yes, the big concrete stands at either end of the ground with
[6151.42 - 6153.42] P:1643.49 E:0.093012 |  Rashford turning now
[6153.46 - 6158.18] P:1542.44 E:0.107690 |  As a rather turning now over on the far side the rain now coming down harder than ever
[6159.18 - 6161.46] P:1667.66 E:0.084198 |  six minutes to play and
[6163.18 - 6165.18] P:1516.72 E:0.096844 |  England cruising it now
[6165.42 - 6167.42] P:1343.26 E:0.091209 |  Henderson to Anderson
[6168.78 - 6171.10] P:1412.91 E:0.099857 |  And then back to Henderson
[6171.94 - 6173.94] P:1302.13 E:0.085034 |  Jed Spence
[6174.22 - 6176.78] P:1439.18 E:0.107795 |  All the way back towards the the halfway line
[6177.42 - 6181.46] P:1531.87 E:0.097165 |  Jed Spence has emerged as quite the took all choice hasn't he yeah
[6182.14 - 6184.14] P:1383.99 E:0.070763 |  He's done well
[6184.18 - 6189.02] P:1445.19 E:0.095546 |  Don't see anything with him in an English show that makes me feel he shouldn't be in and around this situation
[6189.70 - 6195.66] P:1586.97 E:0.101798 |  Jordan Henderson lifting one over the top looking for the the run of Spence into the penalty area half cleared away
[6196.22 - 6200.46] P:1484.23 E:0.107905 |  Anderson and then Jordan Henderson looks one way passes it the other
[6201.42 - 6203.94] P:1474.74 E:0.094134 |  Henderson back towards the the center circle
[6204.30 - 6207.26] P:1437.92 E:0.098076 |  That rain is coming straight down now
[6207.26 - 6215.06] P:1444.72 E:0.103457 |  You can probably hear it drumming on the on the corrugated iron roof above our heads people three rows in front of us are getting soaked
[6215.38 - 6222.30] P:1301.88 E:0.098561 |  Here's Henderson again up to the right-hand side to Spence and then back towards the the halfway line
[6223.34 - 6224.54] P:1358.57 E:0.119143 |  It has been very
[6224.78 - 6228.10] P:1411.60 E:0.098854 |  Autumnal Regal let me tell you the weather changeable
[6228.10 - 6232.78] P:1592.80 E:0.092655 |  But when the sun has shone I mean the autumn colors the cobbled street the domes the spires
[6233.30 - 6236.62] P:1610.25 E:0.102274 |  The the blue and white trams trundling through the streets
[6236.62 - 6242.22] P:1435.00 E:0.097016 |  It is a very picturesque place to come to and England have enjoyed their visit winning here the most important thing
[6242.38 - 6246.30] P:1471.99 E:0.093312 |  To get the result that they needed and get qualifications sorted out
[6246.62 - 6252.88] P:1657.28 E:0.100989 |  Lapier coming forward. They just want another clean sheet six wins out of six. It'll be no goals conceded
[6253.00 - 6256.16] P:1500.48 E:0.097984 |  England's through the middle again attacking born now to the
[6256.80 - 6264.08] P:1684.04 E:0.101252 |  Left to Esa cuts in field and shoots and scores and it's 5-0 to England and they're doing it on style
[6264.40 - 6271.54] P:1467.53 E:0.101204 |  And as I know points to the heavens with the rain pouring down on him England World Cup bound and winning here in Riga
[6271.54 - 6273.74] P:1928.90 E:0.101310 |  5-0 against sorry Latvia
[6273.84 - 6281.28] P:1501.12 E:0.101819 |  Well, it's another goal from a really good piece of just defensive play turning the ball over like England have done all evening
[6281.68 - 6284.56] P:1571.32 E:0.102021 |  Really hunted in packs and won the ball back efficiently
[6284.84 - 6288.24] P:1563.11 E:0.096919 |  It's with bow and he's driving forward through the heart of the pitch
[6288.68 - 6293.96] P:1350.37 E:0.095336 |  He sees as a slips him the ball and then he's got quite a bit of work to do has to be said
[6294.80 - 6297.20] P:1287.48 E:0.090028 |  He's got a couple of players that dropped back with him
[6297.20 - 6301.28] P:1346.59 E:0.092055 |  But he's on the left hand side of the box, but he has that little opening to drift inside
[6301.40 - 6304.88] P:1374.97 E:0.101018 |  You can't allow him inside on to his right foot and the moment they do
[6305.40 - 6308.72] P:1311.15 E:0.093337 |  He just slots it into that far post bottom corners
[6308.72 - 6313.84] P:1373.20 E:0.091554 |  It's a good finishing on show tonight from England and as a taking full
[6315.24 - 6318.82] P:1391.67 E:0.099858 |  Opportunity to put that ball in the back there. They're really nice goal
[6318.82 - 6323.16] P:1719.06 E:0.096382 |  Yep second goal for England in his 14th appearance for the new Arsenal man
[6323.16 - 6329.00] P:1548.13 E:0.091297 |  And indeed both goals have been against Latvia at Wembley in March and here in Riga in
[6329.64 - 6335.96] P:1689.40 E:0.093233 |  October so 5-0 it is which I think is the kind of score line that's matched England's performers
[6335.96 - 6342.64] P:1565.79 E:0.085566 |  Yeah, I had a feeling that it could be this type of score line tonight and England certainly haven't disappointed
[6343.44 - 6348.64] P:1622.25 E:0.096860 |  No, they haven't they have found their groove haven't they coming into these autumn
[6349.32 - 6350.24] P:1592.31 E:0.092634 |  qualifiers
[6350.24 - 6355.56] P:1633.13 E:0.099332 |  We were talking you know are they going to be able to find their identity the way that Thomas Tuchel wants them to play well
[6355.56 - 6358.16] P:1487.64 E:0.089385 |  They've done that resoundingly. Yeah, I agree
[6359.04 - 6362.08] P:1368.00 E:0.102888 |  And you want to see that time and time and time again
[6362.56 - 6367.84] P:1367.58 E:0.102090 |  Thomas Tuchel wants to see it in training again as he just claps the away fans there Thomas Tuchel
[6367.84 - 6371.04] P:1540.44 E:0.111975 |  Yeah, if you didn't hear earlier as Ian was saying that
[6371.92 - 6376.40] P:1564.36 E:0.108968 |  The England fans were were having a bit of fun with Thomas Tuchel after what he said
[6376.88 - 6381.24] P:1434.23 E:0.099304 |  About how quiet Wembley was on Thursday night against Wales
[6381.80 - 6388.36] P:1465.07 E:0.098281 |  So they were singing are we loud enough for you was it quite for you John? Well, the thing is with Wembley
[6389.12 - 6394.28] P:1599.35 E:0.108914 |  You know, I think virtually every England manager has complained about the atmosphere at Wembley at one time
[6394.28 - 6397.80] P:1574.11 E:0.108170 |  I know that you know Garry Southgate remember how frustrated he got with the paper planes
[6402.80 - 6408.60] P:1712.77 E:0.106570 |  Accounting is being replaced for the final minutes of the match by Chris Dapps
[6409.32 - 6411.40] P:1912.60 E:0.109063 |  Grabowskis who was winning his first cap

[6417.12 - 6421.28] P:1663.34 E:0.101868 |  He's able to to get his first experience of international football here
[6421.76 - 6426.76] P:1547.76 E:0.090632 |  Against Thomas Tuchel's England side Latvia nil England five
[6427.08 - 6434.24] P:1742.65 E:0.087817 |  We will bring you the interviews from life down in the tunnel area here in this compact stadium just over 10,000 people
[6434.88 - 6436.88] P:1755.12 E:0.085638 |  10,400 and
[6437.00 - 6442.88] P:1732.88 E:0.092507 |  2,700 England fans many of whom have been watching from underneath the stand to our right in the second half Jared
[6442.96 - 6444.96] P:1602.73 E:0.084009 |  bonus taken a knock
[6445.12 - 6448.28] P:1687.42 E:0.085592 |  Whether he's just taking a kick on the ankle perhaps
[6448.56 - 6452.68] P:1746.60 E:0.090267 |  They look like that and he is he is down on his knees and he's felt that one
[6452.68 - 6454.68] P:1803.70 E:0.087687 |  You know how sore that can be as
[6455.40 - 6456.60] P:1517.34 E:0.068951 |  Latvia
[6456.60 - 6459.60] P:1743.00 E:0.095635 |  Do attack down the left-hand side with Tegan Yix
[6460.00 - 6467.52] P:1718.53 E:0.096887 |  Then the run forward down into the towards the full back position Tegan Yix gets that bad tries to turn Harry Kane puts in the
[6468.08 - 6471.48] P:1576.60 E:0.089797 |  Challenge Harry Kane who's playing the full match incidentally
[6471.88 - 6476.84] P:1576.20 E:0.090875 |  Having scored two goals by a new next packed schedule, but
[6477.64 - 6483.96] P:1723.61 E:0.093096 |  He wants to play doesn't the and Thomas Tuchel wants him to play didn't play against Wales because of the bruised foot Latvia
[6484.92 - 6486.92] P:1521.43 E:0.095376 |  as we move into the
[6487.00 - 6492.88] P:1606.50 E:0.102013 |  Towards the 90th minute of this World Cup qualifier Latvia attacking and the ball deflected goalwards
[6492.88 - 6499.44] P:1711.17 E:0.092112 |  But then cleared away up in the air by Jordan Henderson and then it is cleared further away with Rashford chasing
[6499.48 - 6506.56] P:1767.73 E:0.098528 |  It gets their first nimble footed Marcus Rashford passing it forward to Harry Kane and England now with Kane and Rashford in full-flaw
[6506.56 - 6511.92] P:1605.68 E:0.105098 |  As they're as well Kane continues on looking for the hat trick and in fact he's bundled over
[6512.48 - 6515.12] P:1784.72 E:0.107556 |  And Kane goes sprawling down onto the pitch
[6516.16 - 6520.84] P:1734.03 E:0.099945 |  23 yards out and it's a free kick. I'm not too sure about that for a foul
[6521.68 - 6524.74] P:1633.54 E:0.100690 |  I think it's a little bit hard Kane does well actually because he looks like he's gonna
[6525.74 - 6532.02] P:1526.07 E:0.104675 |  Unleash the shot Rashford makes a brilliant run real energy that Marcus Rashford brought onto the pitch as a substitute
[6532.54 - 6537.42] P:1438.08 E:0.103541 |  But he just refrains from it puts the brakes on a little bit and there's a small bit of contact
[6537.94 - 6541.56] P:1452.72 E:0.105541 |  But he knows what he's doing Harry Kane and he goes down and wins the foul
[6543.70 - 6547.58] P:1395.83 E:0.104146 |  Two minutes of added time and England with this free kick
[6547.58 - 6551.70] P:1357.03 E:0.109395 |  I think England were a little fortunate Harry Kane to have VAR
[6552.70 - 6557.78] P:1310.02 E:0.096245 |  The warring England a penalty just before halftime that Harry Kane scored that
[6558.78 - 6560.62] P:1240.36 E:0.098349 |  he
[6560.62 - 6563.94] P:1388.81 E:0.113062 |  Is involved in this he's at the heart of this Harry Kane
[6564.54 - 6568.98] P:1400.33 E:0.098729 |  So he's got two goals. He has the chance to score a hat trick and he is one
[6569.62 - 6577.38] P:1546.15 E:0.098127 |  Hat trick away from equaling Jimmy Greaves as record of six hat tricks for the England senior men's team
[6578.38 - 6583.06] P:1370.79 E:0.102639 |  At came it is going to be Harry Kane. I don't think that's any surprise
[6584.34 - 6587.82] P:1490.64 E:0.110533 |  So this will be between 25 and 30 yards out
[6588.50 - 6594.10] P:1460.60 E:0.109659 |  Kane on his right foot the Latvian wall is lined up just outside the box
[6595.82 - 6599.50] P:1593.69 E:0.114268 |  Born to the right of the ball, but surely it's came it is right for it from came
[6599.50 - 6606.86] P:1489.57 E:0.106524 |  But it's over the wall and over the high over the crossbar as well and actually fielded very well by an absolutely soaked ball boy
[6607.38 - 6609.82] P:1276.67 E:0.092911 |  Who caught it on the half body quite cleverly?
[6609.90 - 6613.82] P:1557.64 E:0.100973 |  So into two minutes about a time we'll have more from Conakody as well
[6613.82 - 6618.90] P:1472.58 E:0.097630 |  Who's back in the studio the five-life studio with Kelly in the latter part of?
[6619.26 - 6625.06] P:1615.03 E:0.090209 |  Five-life sport this evening on air till 10 30 will hear from Thomas Tuchel a victorious Thomas Tuchel
[6625.42 - 6629.90] P:1603.50 E:0.090918 |  Leading England to World Cup qualification having won his first six
[6630.42 - 6631.94] P:1448.51 E:0.077389 |  competitive matches
[6631.94 - 6636.34] P:1502.60 E:0.090666 |  Fabio Capello by the way won his first eight competitive matches
[6636.58 - 6641.74] P:1412.03 E:0.095426 |  But to win six out of six and I know people will say well the call it to the opposition
[6641.74 - 6643.74] P:1552.90 E:0.088072 |  It hasn't been the the sternest
[6644.38 - 6647.82] P:1394.23 E:0.086661 |  But to win six out of six and not concede a goal
[6647.82 - 6650.26] P:1395.91 E:0.077902 |  Yeah, you can't get away from that
[6650.26 - 6657.38] P:1260.99 E:0.092232 |  It hasn't been the sternest because it hasn't but you still got to come up with with the goods and England are doing
[6658.18 - 6663.78] P:1497.57 E:0.112020 |  Here they are looking for another one Anderson's ball across goal that's pushed away by the goalkeeper to
[6664.38 - 6669.78] P:1441.02 E:0.096153 |  Find a teammate with that diving clearance and there it is
[6669.78 - 6673.42] P:1588.35 E:0.111480 |  The final whistle goes and with that final whistle
[6673.42 - 6678.10] P:1640.10 E:0.096142 |  We can say that England will be at the World Cup in the Americas in
[6678.94 - 6684.66] P:1649.53 E:0.100395 |  2026 they've done the job and they've done it in style winning five mil here in the reign of
[6685.14 - 6691.62] P:1680.55 E:0.102283 |  Riga it feels a world away the conditions that we're sitting in here from I don't know Florida next summer
[6692.22 - 6695.86] P:1620.46 E:0.111041 |  Certainly nothing like Kansas will be which is where England may well be based
[6696.22 - 6704.30] P:1622.91 E:0.100418 |  But England have qualified for the World Cup with two matches to spare and Thomas Tuchel has achieved his first goal
[6704.62 - 6706.62] P:1537.93 E:0.075887 |  As the England head coach
[6706.94 - 6711.98] P:1475.75 E:0.097506 |  Yeah, I mean take away the opposition and just focus on England for a moment
[6711.98 - 6717.26] P:1621.53 E:0.098182 |  What we're looking from a group of players and a team that can go on and achieve great things in a World Cup
[6717.26 - 6721.38] P:1432.84 E:0.094763 |  You're seeing really good traits in this team at the moment
[6721.62 - 6728.54] P:1635.88 E:0.096780 |  I think Thomas Tuchel is going to be very happy very positive with his team's attitude application with the whole display
[6728.90 - 6734.06] P:1509.64 E:0.100405 |  They were they were clinical in front of goal had some really good movements in and around off the ball
[6734.70 - 6739.12] P:1662.01 E:0.089352 |  Defensively another clean sheet. It's been a good evening. Yeah, six wins out of six
[6739.50 - 6746.74] P:1657.10 E:0.099758 |  Clean sheets in in all of the matches. We're not seeing wild celebrations marked by by any means from the England players
[6747.02 - 6753.38] P:1652.02 E:0.093638 |  You know, they are they're aware of what they've done and how they've done it and the opponents that they've done it against
[6753.38 - 6756.42] P:1778.44 E:0.092114 |  But they should be proud shouldn't they have their achievement nevertheless?
[6756.82 - 6759.26] P:1714.75 E:0.069540 |  Yeah, I think you know the confidence of this group
[6759.54 - 6765.98] P:1733.41 E:0.082806 |  They felt that this was going to happen anyway, and they were absolutely right and it felt like that right from the first ball was kicked
[6765.98 - 6768.30] P:1523.45 E:0.090916 |  To be honest, I mean England in total control
[6768.78 - 6774.64] P:1615.05 E:0.086583 |  Looked like they had an objective that they were going to have to complete and they did it comfortably and like you say John
[6774.64 - 6781.00] P:1638.57 E:0.082877 |  They just congratulation each it congratulating each other, but it feels like it's totally expected
[6781.00 - 6782.08] P:1678.57 E:0.083527 |  Yeah, Thomas Tuchel
[6782.08 - 6785.92] P:1786.92 E:0.099416 |  I'm just watching him now as the Latvian players have moved away the handshakes have happened
[6785.92 - 6791.32] P:1875.07 E:0.092634 |  And now the England squad are all by themselves in the middle of that half. It's an incongruous sight
[6791.32 - 6795.72] P:1868.51 E:0.095842 |  I must say with the floodlights shining down the rain falling that
[6796.24 - 6801.88] P:1777.37 E:0.093086 |  The backdrop of the trees and the massive scoreboard and away to the right the England fans
[6801.88 - 6806.84] P:1825.02 E:0.098035 |  Those who are still in their seats sulked as well in there are welcoming them
[6807.40 - 6814.04] P:1572.03 E:0.094758 |  Welcoming them all that and they are being led there the England players by the captain by Harry Kane
[6814.32 - 6821.60] P:1712.25 E:0.099724 |  Who is now being followed by the rest of his teammates right off the pitch and towards the advertising hoardings?
[6821.60 - 6824.84] P:1683.48 E:0.097271 |  I think they might be going to yes, he is yeah, Harry Kane is actually
[6825.08 - 6826.20] P:1566.73 E:0.075708 |  What?
[6826.20 - 6830.72] P:1680.30 E:0.102201 |  Stepping over the hoardings and they're going to walk. I mean it must be it must be 40 yards
[6831.36 - 6834.52] P:1799.87 E:0.092029 |  Behind the goal that stand in which the England
[6835.12 - 6841.12] P:1666.28 E:0.102161 |  Supporters are in and they're lifting their flags now the England fans the crosses of St. George and waving them and all of the
[6841.20 - 6845.00] P:1542.99 E:0.106229 |  Photographers gather around and the England players down below applauding up towards the fans
[6845.00 - 6846.92] P:1604.46 E:0.097050 |  Yes, it's a lovely touch and for me
[6846.92 - 6854.28] P:1418.10 E:0.103576 |  It's only right these supporters have traveled a long way in really difficult conditions this evening to come here and support the team
[6854.28 - 6860.36] P:1593.10 E:0.101583 |  And they've done it brilliantly and it's just a nice touch from the group and the manager to go across and show their appreciation
[6861.28 - 6869.60] P:1607.46 E:0.100900 |  Yep, it is mission accomplished in terms of World Cup qualification and the England players standing in a line at that end while the rest of the
[6869.60 - 6870.60] P:1395.93 E:0.091866 |  Stadium is
[6870.60 - 6876.00] P:1564.20 E:0.098613 |  Is emptying I must mention a flag by the way I sought the other end in the in amongst the Latvia fans
[6876.00 - 6882.32] P:1611.35 E:0.101822 |  It was a Latvia flag with Stourbridge Latvia written across the middle on the top BC FC
[6882.44 - 6887.96] P:1575.57 E:0.101725 |  Birmingham City FC one of your old clubs Matt and it had the names of Ann and Tommy on one side and underneath
[6888.68 - 6892.10] P:1653.52 E:0.104278 |  WBA the Hawthorns with Jack and Colin
[6892.76 - 6895.52] P:1426.66 E:0.109680 |  Fascinated to know the story behind that Latvia flag
[6895.52 - 6899.52] P:1742.44 E:0.100424 |  But anyway, the story is all about England tonight and their qualification
[6899.92 - 6905.80] P:1658.20 E:0.098548 |  Having been sealed for the World Cup after goals from Gordon two from came one a penalty
[6906.28 - 6911.88] P:1589.54 E:0.098991 |  76 now for England for him a Tony said zone goal and then a Berrucha as a
[6912.12 - 6919.28] P:1666.31 E:0.097516 |  Scoring to make it 5-0 Latvia nil England 5 the final score and England are bound for the World Cup
[6920.84 - 6927.40] P:1530.86 E:0.116707 |  John Murray Ian Dennis and Matthew Upson in Riga for us this evening as we've been here in the England players are making their way over
[6927.76 - 6934.16] P:1589.68 E:0.108873 |  To the England fans in that Baltic rain in Riga this evening Conor Cody is also with us Connor
[6934.16 - 6936.72] P:1480.93 E:0.107148 |  We've been saying it was a straightforward win for England
[6936.80 - 6941.08] P:1438.94 E:0.105457 |  But nevertheless an impressive one because they have to go out and they have to do it
[6941.44 - 6945.24] P:1426.16 E:0.099602 |  Straightforward win yet as we expected I think Kelly, but you still got to go and do the business
[6945.24 - 6948.40] P:1584.09 E:0.096645 |  You still got to go and perform you still got to go in score goals
[6948.40 - 6951.32] P:1301.95 E:0.105435 |  You still got to go and do things the right way and I thought England were fantastic
[6951.32 - 6955.76] P:1419.76 E:0.100052 |  What I love most is the reaction when they lost the ball the professionalism to go and win the ball back
[6955.76 - 6960.52] P:1371.78 E:0.099433 |  There was always four or five bodies around the ball to win it back and then start another attack and I love these
[6960.68 - 6965.32] P:1442.35 E:0.093161 |  Substitutions after 4-0 I just thought at 4-0 you keep the same players on the pitch
[6965.32 - 6969.20] P:1513.04 E:0.100229 |  It can just drop a little bit because the game is one all the sudden you bring players on the pitch
[6969.20 - 6974.04] P:1567.76 E:0.101551 |  You want to score can see opportunities to score and we've seen the goals that that were added towards the end of the game
[6974.04 - 6975.40] P:1393.44 E:0.108523 |  So really professional from England
[6975.40 - 6978.76] P:1468.76 E:0.087848 |  I think it's bring a brilliant qualifying campaign and listen
[6978.76 - 6981.44] P:1156.65 E:0.099319 |  It's going to another World Cup and then players will be absolutely over the moon
[6981.60 - 6985.72] P:1643.46 E:0.105042 |  We're gonna be here till 10 30 so we'll have time to go into the into the details of it
[6985.96 - 6990.64] P:1598.25 E:0.098447 |  In terms of going to the World Cup obviously the draw is not going to be made until the beginning of December
[6990.64 - 6992.44] P:1200.51 E:0.093915 |  So we don't know who England's opponents are going to be
[6992.56 - 6999.60] P:1595.70 E:0.096706 |  What we do know though is it's a bigger World Cup and there are going to be this kind of game that England potentially are going to be playing in
[6999.64 - 7005.68] P:1677.14 E:0.090584 |  There's a different style of football sometimes at World Cups to what there is in in the build-up to World Cup
[7005.68 - 7008.68] P:1664.09 E:0.088427 |  So it's important that they're prepared for for every eventuality
[7008.96 - 7010.76] P:1690.71 E:0.079956 |  Of course it is but it's
[7010.80 - 7016.48] P:1597.27 E:0.101718 |  World Cups are always different to anything I was lucky enough to obviously go to Katara and when you get there the most extraordinary
[7017.72 - 7019.36] P:1618.53 E:0.077228 |  amazing
[7019.36 - 7021.68] P:1171.23 E:0.101124 |  Experiences you will ever have in your life as a player
[7021.68 - 7027.64] P:1322.55 E:0.103869 |  So for them players now be excited because there's a lot of them have played at major tournaments before a lot of them are incredible footballers
[7027.64 - 7029.84] P:1734.02 E:0.092650 |  We all know who they are within the squad
[7029.84 - 7034.24] P:1351.89 E:0.098605 |  But a lot of them will be first time going to a World Cup so get excited be excited that it's a bigger tournament
[7034.56 - 7039.88] P:1654.05 E:0.092087 |  Be excited there's a lot of traveling or whatever it's going to bring because they are the best experiences you will ever have
[7039.92 - 7045.76] P:1682.94 E:0.098210 |  So now it's a brilliant brilliant achievement for England something that we expected them to do it was the the minimum that we expected
[7045.76 - 7048.08] P:1589.50 E:0.092519 |  But now they've gone and done it without conceiving a goal
[7048.08 - 7052.92] P:1425.65 E:0.092539 |  Can they go through the whole campaign now and and get it finished off in the right way those England players heading over to the
[7052.92 - 7058.64] P:1735.13 E:0.097019 |  The England fans are absolutely drenched in icy cold rain over in Latvia
[7058.64 - 7061.72] P:1481.53 E:0.108824 |  But I think you were saying that earlier on the England fans have traveled a long way
[7061.72 - 7068.08] P:1766.56 E:0.106865 |  It's only right that the players should go over and show their appreciation but equally those England fans will be delighted with what they've seen
[7068.12 - 7073.56] P:1669.64 E:0.093721 |  There was a lot of talk early on in Thomas Tuchel's time that maybe it wasn't the most exciting that it wasn't the most
[7073.84 - 7080.44] P:1645.82 E:0.085609 |  Front foot at times that there's proof look against we should qualify that by the opposition that they played
[7080.44 - 7084.32] P:1731.49 E:0.099080 |  But they're showing that they can get it done and they can build that that rhythm
[7085.32 - 7088.92] P:1638.42 E:0.081390 |  Yeah, I agree Kelly and I think that you know
[7088.92 - 7095.60] P:1661.03 E:0.093751 |  It's not easy coming into a fresh group of players as a manager having very limited exposure and having to pick the right team
[7095.60 - 7098.00] P:1631.01 E:0.086661 |  So yes, there were some bumps in the road
[7098.00 - 7103.12] P:1740.73 E:0.089197 |  But you feel that he's got a handle on the character of the players and how they react
[7103.28 - 7110.64] P:1564.63 E:0.082106 |  What type of player he wants in the group the balance of the team looks good Anderson again this evening was excellent
[7110.64 - 7114.20] P:1571.44 E:0.080210 |  And like I said to John, you know in the commentary
[7114.20 - 7117.76] P:1581.47 E:0.076535 |  I don't expect massive of changes for the next game
[7117.76 - 7122.40] P:1631.48 E:0.093770 |  I just don't I think but when you're in this moment you're in this rhythm is set his stall out and
[7123.04 - 7126.44] P:1560.64 E:0.076786 |  It's having a positive impact in terms of the performance of the players
[7126.44 - 7130.48] P:1762.58 E:0.084692 |  So I fully expect the team to be very similar, but also as well
[7130.48 - 7134.24] P:1774.42 E:0.088460 |  It was against the lesser opposition if you think back to the start of his reign
[7135.12 - 7138.44] P:1474.74 E:0.106620 |  Albania at home and Latvia at home where they won 2-0 and 3-0
[7138.44 - 7143.84] P:1658.86 E:0.096313 |  They laboured in Barcelona when they only be Andorra 1-0 in the in the qualifier in June
[7143.92 - 7148.08] P:1870.64 E:0.089702 |  And he was criticized for those performances Thomas Tuchel and quite rightly he was criticized
[7148.32 - 7149.76] P:1939.07 E:0.067351 |  So therefore
[7149.76 - 7152.96] P:1857.78 E:0.093687 |  When you're playing against the opposition and you now putting them to the sword
[7153.04 - 7156.40] P:1919.37 E:0.081507 |  He should be praised because the last three games has seen a marked improvement
[7157.04 - 7163.32] P:1638.93 E:0.109414 |  Deno just before you head off and I know John's gone down to get some interviews and you're going to be going down there very shortly as well
[7163.48 - 7168.12] P:1710.99 E:0.100167 |  But in terms of the substitutions, that's what Connor mentioned the fact that it you know for nail up
[7168.16 - 7172.72] P:1759.12 E:0.092818 |  There was a temptation for England to to maybe relax a little bit into the game
[7172.72 - 7180.48] P:1703.21 E:0.096457 |  But it was Henderson as a bow and came on and he's getting minutes in in these players who could prove crucial when the tournament gets underway
[7181.28 - 7184.84] P:1779.88 E:0.093584 |  Yeah, and he didn't he didn't get that in the second half against Wales
[7184.84 - 7189.72] P:1898.50 E:0.085277 |  So I think that element would have would have pleased Thomas Tuchel tonight because he's you know
[7189.72 - 7191.72] P:1692.74 E:0.098258 |  we talked before ahead of the game about the
[7193.28 - 7198.32] P:1680.52 E:0.091817 |  The hidden messages if you like for Jude Belegum, he's been quite clear regarding Marcus Rashford
[7198.32 - 7204.64] P:1796.21 E:0.090500 |  You know you can only be a great player if you go and achieve great things and he says for Marcus Rashford
[7204.64 - 7208.92] P:1809.33 E:0.096468 |  You know you've got no limits as far as your career is concerned, but you've got to go out and prove it
[7208.92 - 7215.04] P:1776.19 E:0.087722 |  So I think when Marcus Rashford comes on tonight and Anthony Gordon deserved to start and you put it a lively performance
[7215.08 - 7219.96] P:1788.10 E:0.097733 |  and scored a fine goal Marcus Rashford now knows what he's got to do to try and
[7221.08 - 7223.08] P:2070.63 E:0.090683 |  You serp dislodge
[7223.52 - 7228.40] P:1792.34 E:0.095672 |  Anthony Gordon from that position all of a sudden in the various elements of the England setup
[7228.40 - 7230.40] P:1771.25 E:0.083961 |  You can see now where
[7230.44 - 7237.60] P:1794.30 E:0.090384 |  Positions are going to be for players competing against each other and Thomas Tuchel has made a point when it was for the start of these
[7238.36 - 7239.60] P:1700.91 E:0.073824 |  autumn games
[7239.60 - 7244.12] P:1643.12 E:0.086966 |  In September he said right. This is where we ramp up the competition
[7244.12 - 7249.92] P:1754.43 E:0.097128 |  He had a slightly larger squad in June and they went away for some warm training in in Barcelona
[7249.92 - 7252.28] P:1719.57 E:0.086961 |  Obviously got John Stones out there as well
[7252.28 - 7258.04] P:1790.94 E:0.086528 |  He deliberately then reduced the squad size in September and that's the reason why you've got you there's no
[7258.64 - 7262.44] P:1860.28 E:0.089346 |  Foden and Bellingham and Grealish because he wants to ramp up the competition
[7262.44 - 7266.82] P:1874.47 E:0.093671 |  He wants to see that hunger and desire from the players who have privileged to wear the shirt now
[7267.04 - 7270.64] P:1781.49 E:0.073952 |  Because if they don't show that then they won't necessarily keep the shirt
[7271.32 - 7275.24] P:1511.44 E:0.098036 |  But England know of course that they will be heading off to the World Cup next summer
[7275.24 - 7278.08] P:1638.99 E:0.104243 |  Denner you're gonna be going a little less far presently
[7278.08 - 7282.70] P:1721.87 E:0.104275 |  You're gonna head down and get some of those interviews at the end of England's five-nil victory
[7282.88 - 7287.16] P:1557.29 E:0.099225 |  Against Latvia, but just to come back to that point matter about the use of the squad
[7287.40 - 7292.12] P:1599.04 E:0.096717 |  By by Thomas Tuchel in this victory against Latvia the fact that he's got players in there
[7292.12 - 7294.28] P:1909.57 E:0.102270 |  He's given them minutes and not just you know
[7294.68 - 7298.60] P:1654.27 E:0.099987 |  Changing players up with five minutes to go is that half an hour for three of them 20 minutes
[7298.84 - 7302.80] P:1615.38 E:0.094378 |  For a couple of those players in the in the squad just keeping everybody involved as well
[7303.48 - 7308.00] P:1652.91 E:0.089207 |  Yeah, it'll be for keeping people involved. It will be for resting players that have had a lot of minutes
[7309.20 - 7312.72] P:1653.49 E:0.091069 |  Having freshness on the pitch like Connor mentioned when you go that far up
[7312.72 - 7316.86] P:1757.22 E:0.086440 |  It's easy just to go into cruise control you bring on someone like Jordan Henderson
[7316.86 - 7323.68] P:1528.32 E:0.087201 |  Who's not gonna stop talking and driving everything with his voice and getting people around him and and then players coming on
[7323.68 - 7329.52] P:1603.33 E:0.086048 |  Wanting to express express themselves to get themselves into the starting lineup so creating healthy competition
[7330.00 - 7334.72] P:1477.26 E:0.089718 |  In an international setup is not that easy because you're not around the players every day
[7334.84 - 7339.56] P:1407.48 E:0.085247 |  You haven't got that ability to to build that so he's actually done that quite quickly
[7340.12 - 7346.56] P:1469.40 E:0.086276 |  Thomas Tuchel and it might need to be a bit ruthless at times and make you know cut off and tough tough decisions
[7346.56 - 7351.04] P:1509.89 E:0.096118 |  But he's shown that he's more than capable of doing that and he does it in a way that is kind of
[7351.60 - 7355.60] P:1464.88 E:0.096044 |  Palatable it's not it's not too brutal even though the decisions are the decisions
[7355.96 - 7359.72] P:1465.52 E:0.083913 |  You know that's that's top-level football that's top-level competition in anything
[7359.72 - 7363.84] P:1376.42 E:0.087552 |  So I feel the squad has that and it can only be a healthy thing for the group
[7363.84 - 7371.40] P:1472.27 E:0.099225 |  And I think we've got the two perfect guests here to reflect on the fact that England have got through their qualifying group without even conceding a goal Connor
[7372.12 - 7378.24] P:1408.54 E:0.101732 |  Yeah, it's always nice. It's always nice and we listened to Jordan Pickford's interview before before the game didn't we
[7378.64 - 7383.64] P:1516.15 E:0.100295 |  Talking about was a team listening. He will love keeping clean sheets whether he touches the ball once or a hundred times
[7383.64 - 7386.72] P:1484.30 E:0.093654 |  He will love keeping clean sheets and it's always the backdrop, isn't it?
[7386.72 - 7391.00] P:1219.48 E:0.099580 |  And there's some big muscle to the same thing as well as defenders as goalkeepers as a team
[7391.08 - 7395.24] P:1664.08 E:0.089312 |  You like keeping clean sheets it keeps you in a game and listen tonight wasn't about staying the game tonight
[7395.24 - 7398.84] P:1470.36 E:0.098600 |  It's about going win the game and scoring four or five goals and doing what England have done
[7398.84 - 7404.12] P:1639.81 E:0.092501 |  But it's always nice and that just keeps on there adding to Jordan Pickford's record doesn't it in terms of nine now
[7404.12 - 7406.48] P:1638.59 E:0.077687 |  So let's keep it going for him. Hey, yeah
[7406.48 - 7409.20] P:1453.93 E:0.105456 |  He's on an incredible run of form in that England goal
[7409.20 - 7416.28] P:1617.32 E:0.091671 |  But the defense starting to really click depending on you know or rather regardless of whose Thomas Tuchel is picking in those positions
[7416.28 - 7420.30] P:1677.40 E:0.097181 |  Maybe the full backs are ones that we can look at between now and 10 30
[7420.30 - 7426.60] P:1625.92 E:0.094788 |  But that record the England are on you know as dinner was we're saying England have now scored Matt in each of their past
[7426.72 - 7431.28] P:1652.67 E:0.091890 |  18 matches that's the first time they've done that since between 1950 and
[7431.80 - 7438.40] P:1578.82 E:0.092772 |  1953 and it's been a long long run in which they've been incredibly successful at both end of the pitch
[7439.64 - 7443.76] P:1548.51 E:0.084484 |  Yeah, no, I agree. There's lots of good things to come out of it
[7443.76 - 7449.76] P:1632.43 E:0.081632 |  I mean the one thing and I think this might refer back to the the Wembley feel in terms of atmosphere as well
[7449.76 - 7452.26] P:1543.33 E:0.090353 |  There's been a lot of games in the last couple of years that have been a bit
[7452.68 - 7456.32] P:1644.52 E:0.087154 |  Kind of flat in terms of teams coming and being very defensive
[7456.32 - 7460.48] P:1526.30 E:0.092566 |  And I think those games can lead to being not the most entertaining they can sometimes draw out
[7460.84 - 7466.68] P:1668.19 E:0.088687 |  Drab kind of displays even though wing England do win the game and we do keep a clean sheet
[7466.92 - 7471.80] P:1600.44 E:0.091529 |  So so it can be a little bit bit misleading to get too excited about those kind of stats
[7471.80 - 7474.68] P:1453.25 E:0.095244 |  They are really you know, they're really impressive
[7474.92 - 7479.72] P:1442.56 E:0.081301 |  but it's about the performances and the and the style of play and
[7480.36 - 7486.40] P:1642.89 E:0.091312 |  What teams you're playing and the jeopardy in the game that really drives the excitement and puts the players to the test
[7487.00 - 7494.12] P:1757.36 E:0.086496 |  And while you have to be professional in these fixtures if you're organised and you're well-drilled and you've got a good group together
[7495.12 - 7498.32] P:1578.78 E:0.082042 |  This England team's got the talent to cruise through these kind of games
[7498.32 - 7501.04] P:1652.46 E:0.094841 |  It really hasn't it shown it in the last three or four matches
[7501.44 - 7505.76] P:1646.31 E:0.082967 |  But when it gets put to the test of those real jeopardy games against top nations
[7505.76 - 7511.36] P:1513.90 E:0.091376 |  That's when you really see what it's all about and maybe maybe this team doesn't get tested enough like that
[7511.96 - 7518.16] P:1639.21 E:0.097692 |  Yeah, there's been an incredible run for for England and as Matt was saying you don't want to read too much into it Conor
[7518.16 - 7521.52] P:1838.61 E:0.103816 |  The danger is that there's always expectation on England anyway
[7521.52 - 7524.72] P:1625.75 E:0.096677 |  And now they're going to be heading into the World Cup with this great record
[7524.72 - 7529.84] P:1716.81 E:0.090023 |  It's 240 days before the World Cup even gets underway in America and suddenly
[7530.36 - 7535.98] P:1469.18 E:0.091016 |  Expectations are just just going to start creeping up a little bit more. Yeah, and that's what we do as English people
[7535.98 - 7537.24] P:1149.18 E:0.123237 |  Isn't it and you wouldn't have it any other way?
[7537.24 - 7542.72] P:1373.82 E:0.097100 |  I think it's it's going to creep up as well because the manager we've got we all understand what the manager's coming for the manager's
[7542.72 - 7548.16] P:1533.07 E:0.097032 |  Remit is to win the World Cup. I think we all expect that we all know what is remit is and listen
[7548.16 - 7551.04] P:1420.09 E:0.097714 |  This country comes with expectation when you pull on the England shape
[7551.04 - 7555.52] P:1326.11 E:0.100753 |  I'll tell you the same thing it comes it weighs heavy because there's an expectation about playing for England
[7555.52 - 7560.92] P:1461.02 E:0.095004 |  You have to win and sometimes I think that comes you mentioned before Kelly about the atmosphere at Wembley and things like that
[7560.92 - 7565.60] P:1427.31 E:0.097218 |  I think it comes because you're expected to win games at that stadium. It's expected to happen English people
[7565.88 - 7571.00] P:1541.42 E:0.099710 |  Expect their team their country to go and win games at stadium. So 100% will be an expectation
[7571.00 - 7575.28] P:1335.98 E:0.094668 |  Let's embrace the expectation. I think we've got a group of players who can embrace that
[7575.28 - 7579.24] P:1492.13 E:0.090711 |  I think we've got strong players who the shit weighs heavy, but they like that
[7579.24 - 7582.20] P:1194.98 E:0.098846 |  They'll take that on board and they'll take it into the world, but I can't wait for it
[7582.20 - 7587.28] P:1278.10 E:0.101463 |  I'm so excited. It's there's nothing compared to a World Cup or a major tournament. So to see England are finally there
[7587.28 - 7589.92] P:1308.32 E:0.076686 |  It really excites me. It's something I can't wait for. Yeah
[7590.52 - 7594.16] P:1640.43 E:0.110871 |  240 days to wait though. Yeah, don't get too carried away too early on
[7594.16 - 7598.28] P:1347.88 E:0.102666 |  We've got 240 days of build up to that one before it before it actually gets underway
[7598.28 - 7602.54] P:1514.71 E:0.106652 |  but just to pick up on that point that Connor made about the the England fans map because
[7602.96 - 7609.44] P:1324.88 E:0.099634 |  People will have heard Thomas Tuchel's comments about them being quite quiet at Wembley and it is it's a different crowd at Wembley
[7609.44 - 7611.70] P:1089.16 E:0.109420 |  And often you've got a lot of families a lot of people who are there
[7611.70 - 7617.80] P:1486.00 E:0.101265 |  It may be there their first or one of the few England games that they they go to is it's a very different crowd the England
[7617.80 - 7623.00] P:1574.68 E:0.094970 |  Traveling fans are very different and they were on very good form for this game in Latvia
[7623.00 - 7625.20] P:1032.26 E:0.106895 |  And we're sort of having a bit of fun with Thomas Tuchel as well
[7625.84 - 7630.64] P:1638.38 E:0.095949 |  Yeah, they were all game actually and he responded really well and I think you know
[7631.38 - 7634.26] P:1367.25 E:0.097261 |  It's probably easier for him to make those comments
[7634.26 - 7636.58] P:1411.47 E:0.091124 |  There may be what it was for someone like Gareth Southgate, you know
[7636.58 - 7642.66] P:1577.74 E:0.086169 |  But he's not English to begin with and he's fresher into the job and he's kind of
[7643.42 - 7650.74] P:1399.39 E:0.083553 |  Has the ability to make those comments, but it's kind of can be harsh, but it's not too cutting
[7650.74 - 7655.02] P:1397.80 E:0.097910 |  You know what I mean? I think he's always open to a viewpoint or a response back as well
[7655.02 - 7659.50] P:1484.88 E:0.083768 |  and I think he felt it as a local derby certainly the Welsh game and
[7660.12 - 7663.80] P:1485.97 E:0.093509 |  Didn't get the response that he wanted out of the home fans and those points you mentioned as well
[7663.80 - 7668.48] P:1362.37 E:0.090260 |  Can in terms of who's going to the game is it families is it so so it is a different mix
[7668.76 - 7675.88] P:1464.97 E:0.079612 |  But but the away fans here this evening. I mean that they were just in full swing turned out in full force
[7675.88 - 7679.44] P:1558.98 E:0.100306 |  I mean, there's a few staying in our hotel. You walk around Riga
[7679.56 - 7683.20] P:1467.20 E:0.087083 |  You'll see England fans dotted about and they've come and really supported the team
[7683.20 - 7688.24] P:1516.27 E:0.082800 |  And you know that a good rapport with Thomas Tuchel this evening and and don't know chatting to them in Latvia and as well
[7688.54 - 7690.54] P:1620.46 E:0.107184 |  Well
[7696.58 - 7699.82] P:1705.00 E:0.102287 |  Yeah, what is it's one of the two things that he's getting up to that's true
[7699.82 - 7703.30] P:1713.69 E:0.099923 |  That's true and in terms of the job that Thomas Tuchel's done Connor
[7703.30 - 7709.14] P:1762.00 E:0.098069 |  What what are your thoughts on how much credit he has to take for for this campaign even I know we
[7709.50 - 7710.74] P:1391.84 E:0.097105 |  I'm gonna stop doing this
[7710.74 - 7715.78] P:1787.58 E:0.100783 |  I feel I've made the point now even in terms of you know the level of the of the group because we've seen
[7716.32 - 7718.92] P:1476.09 E:0.104920 |  lackluster qualifying campaigns at times against
[7719.60 - 7726.24] P:1553.89 E:0.097263 |  Supposedly beatable opposition, but this is as near to perfect as England could have been so how much credit does Tuchel take a lot of it
[7726.24 - 7729.76] P:1570.02 E:0.095313 |  Most of it all of it. Whatever you want to say. I think he's been brilliant. I love
[7730.28 - 7732.86] P:1710.54 E:0.102931 |  We're England out the minute. I love the feeling around the squad
[7732.86 - 7738.36] P:1536.77 E:0.097658 |  I love the feeling around how ruthless the manager is and he is ruthless and we go back to kind of the little dig
[7738.36 - 7740.00] P:1722.11 E:0.093649 |  He added the supporters, but let's be honest
[7740.00 - 7741.08] P:874.80 E:0.104195 |  He's ruthless with the players as well
[7741.14 - 7746.10] P:1525.88 E:0.094228 |  Everything he's come out in the week to talk about Marcus Rashford needing to be the best in the world can be the best in the world
[7746.18 - 7748.94] P:1557.48 E:0.090714 |  We've obviously touched on before the game about the players he left out
[7749.10 - 7754.34] P:1587.59 E:0.095345 |  It's not just these being ruthless with one one side of the nation with supporters or just were plays
[7754.34 - 7759.10] P:1675.98 E:0.090035 |  He's ruthless with anyone because he wants the best and he wants the best for his team and we can see that so
[7759.10 - 7761.26] P:1546.74 E:0.093694 |  I think he takes an awful amount of credit
[7761.26 - 7766.74] P:1586.99 E:0.100968 |  And it just makes me laugh whenever we see an English manager and the first thing when he first come in and you expect miracles straight away
[7766.74 - 7770.62] P:1440.31 E:0.101469 |  Don't we so we all give him criticism for the for the winner and door and all this sort of thing
[7770.62 - 7772.92] P:1348.43 E:0.098580 |  But now we're sat there going England in a real good place
[7772.92 - 7776.04] P:1388.77 E:0.096706 |  I love the clip in the first half where the fans were we're giving them a little bit
[7776.04 - 7780.00] P:1563.51 E:0.101814 |  He had a little right smile and put his hand up and I just feel like England in a real good place
[7780.00 - 7785.20] P:1508.94 E:0.091487 |  So good place to move forward a good place to to improve and get better obviously leading into that massive tournament next year
[7788.92 - 7792.72] P:1806.21 E:0.076319 |  Hold that thought because John Murray is talking to Harry Kane
[7792.84 - 7793.36] P:2111.95 E:0.060266 |  Yes
[7793.36 - 7797.72] P:1588.15 E:0.109453 |  Here is the England captain Harry Kane on the night that World Cup qualification has been
[7798.26 - 7804.50] P:1712.94 E:0.096690 |  Assured and delivered and you've led from the front Harry. You did it well, didn't you? Yeah, it was a great game from us
[7804.50 - 7810.86] P:1534.33 E:0.088077 |  I spoke before about you know building momentum and no matter who we play to hold on to that to hold on to winning games
[7810.86 - 7815.38] P:1739.62 E:0.087223 |  To hold on to clean sheets to pressing high scoring goals and then we done all that so
[7815.94 - 7820.46] P:1625.01 E:0.085689 |  Another great camp we can be really proud to qualify with with two games to spare
[7820.46 - 7825.80] P:1680.81 E:0.092117 |  It's never as easy as what it looks, you know a lot of preparation a lot of hard work goes into into what we do and ultimately
[7825.80 - 7830.20] P:1605.35 E:0.089795 |  You know we have to handle that pressure of being the favorites and and we've done that really well so far
[7830.20 - 7837.30] P:1575.47 E:0.089719 |  So another tournament to look forward to is the best thing about this particular window the fact that you have been able to
[7837.30 - 7840.62] P:1638.87 E:0.086445 |  Follow on and pick up from where you left off in Serbia
[7840.62 - 7842.94] P:1595.31 E:0.091326 |  Yeah, 100% and after the Serbia game
[7842.94 - 7848.22] P:1582.06 E:0.088397 |  You know I spoke to the group about that about you know building the momentum that we're we're feeling amongst each other not just on
[7848.22 - 7850.22] P:1627.72 E:0.073301 |  The pitch but also off the pitch and
[7850.22 - 7851.88] P:1625.19 E:0.095840 |  You know these camps come around quick
[7851.94 - 7854.46] P:1534.35 E:0.095113 |  We play so many games at club level before we know it we're back again
[7854.46 - 7858.46] P:1413.09 E:0.087099 |  And it's important to keep that ball rolling and even though we've qualified now
[7859.02 - 7865.02] P:1603.93 E:0.090761 |  Still two big games in the November camp and I think we've only got six games from now until the first World Cup game
[7865.02 - 7870.44] P:1599.62 E:0.089521 |  So every moment counts every training session every day together. It's about building something special and
[7871.06 - 7873.54] P:1800.55 E:0.094141 |  You know we've been doing that especially over the last few camps
[7873.54 - 7878.22] P:1451.68 E:0.095596 |  So hopefully November will be no different and of all the many achievements and things that you've done
[7878.68 - 7885.74] P:1638.65 E:0.093082 |  You know every single tournament will cook European Championship when England have qualified you've been on the score sheet all of them
[7885.74 - 7888.16] P:1661.36 E:0.105967 |  Yeah, that's right on the night. It's been done
[7889.16 - 7893.34] P:1639.82 E:0.086796 |  So yeah for me I always try and celebrate things like it's the first
[7893.34 - 7897.98] P:1643.45 E:0.084584 |  You know I I spoke before about how proud I am to play for England and especially major tournaments and
[7898.64 - 7901.00] P:1854.98 E:0.092634 |  Yeah, whether it's your first or whether it's your fifth sixth
[7901.32 - 7907.60] P:1660.05 E:0.087145 |  They're all special and I think American that's that summer will definitely be be special and will feel that so
[7908.22 - 7911.28] P:1545.64 E:0.089537 |  Never take these moments for granted and like I touched on earlier
[7911.28 - 7915.92] P:1659.28 E:0.085426 |  We spend a lot of time a lot of hard work together to achieve this so we should celebrate tonight and
[7916.28 - 7921.30] P:1403.35 E:0.092027 |  On the plane home and then look forward to getting back to club level and can I just ask as well
[7921.52 - 7926.20] P:1600.92 E:0.098637 |  The the style in which England have played in these recent matches, you know, you found the groove there
[7926.80 - 7930.92] P:1396.49 E:0.092734 |  You played in America at the FIFA Club World Cup with Bayern Munich last summer
[7931.52 - 7938.12] P:1534.37 E:0.085211 |  Is it going to be possible to play this style this high-tempo pressing style in those conditions?
[7938.14 - 7940.14] P:1755.18 E:0.088415 |  I think so I think sometimes
[7940.82 - 7944.54] P:1685.48 E:0.078613 |  You know, it sounds like you're taking a high risk or it sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort
[7944.54 - 7948.42] P:1560.56 E:0.085387 |  But it's sometimes funny if you do it early and do it and win the ball back quickly
[7948.42 - 7951.94] P:1612.29 E:0.090223 |  You're the one who actually has a lot of possession and I think we found that in the summer with with buying
[7951.94 - 7957.62] P:1641.59 E:0.092979 |  You know, we ended up having 60 70% of the ball, which is probably the most important thing when you're planning that he making the other team run
[7957.62 - 7958.74] P:1324.43 E:0.080399 |  So
[7958.74 - 7963.38] P:1521.12 E:0.085390 |  Yeah, and of course sometimes the opposition always gonna break the press and you have to you have to run back
[7963.38 - 7967.58] P:1575.54 E:0.087609 |  But ultimately I think if you get it right you will actually win it back quicker and then you'll keep more possession
[7967.60 - 7971.52] P:1727.66 E:0.090767 |  So that's our aim. We want to be an aggressive team. We've shown that in the last few games, especially
[7972.28 - 7975.72] P:1558.44 E:0.084612 |  And yeah, we're gonna of course come up against tougher tests and better teams
[7975.72 - 7981.34] P:1572.45 E:0.086433 |  So all this is just great practice for when that comes well done tonight and enjoy the moment with the teammates
[7981.34 - 7983.90] P:1478.40 E:0.077777 |  Thank you. Thanks Harry. Harry Kane England captain
[7984.30 - 7990.44] P:1673.37 E:0.095729 |  Thank you very much John Murray John Murray and Ian Dennis in the tunnel and getting interviews from within that England camp and
[7990.44 - 7993.12] P:1787.88 E:0.100723 |  We'll play them to you as and when they come in
[7993.30 - 7997.14] P:1691.92 E:0.099455 |  It really interesting couple of points that he made in in that interview Matt
[7997.14 - 8002.00] P:1559.00 E:0.099725 |  One of them was about building momentum that he said they're feeling on and off the pitch
[8002.00 - 8004.26] P:1460.90 E:0.092914 |  It's not just about the fact this is job done
[8004.26 - 8010.46] P:1592.25 E:0.096365 |  Then they've got the games to come at home to Serbia and then away in Albania in the November
[8010.58 - 8014.70] P:1792.89 E:0.091235 |  International break and then I think it's four games between then and the the start of the World Cup
[8014.70 - 8021.36] P:1666.22 E:0.091316 |  We said this isn't about just filling that time and using this to experiment. This is about building momentum ahead of a tournament
[8022.22 - 8026.28] P:1664.04 E:0.079457 |  Yeah, very much feels like that. It's not about filling the time and discovering and well
[8026.28 - 8030.54] P:1609.03 E:0.085537 |  Should we have a look at this or should we try that out? No, I think it's like this is us
[8030.54 - 8033.08] P:1619.93 E:0.079261 |  This is what we're doing. Let's just get better at that
[8033.08 - 8038.02] P:1716.22 E:0.071541 |  Let's get better at being us and whether it is that press where they win it back
[8038.02 - 8043.46] P:1810.09 E:0.078311 |  I completely agree with his point that he's made to John's question there in the sense that if you can win the ball back quicker
[8043.46 - 8045.96] P:1492.76 E:0.076587 |  It's gonna save you overall in the game
[8046.34 - 8051.92] P:1746.59 E:0.067343 |  More energy and more running if you can win it back quicker because you have the ball again and then you go again
[8051.92 - 8055.04] P:1741.76 E:0.076523 |  So if that is something that England are gonna work at out of possession
[8055.04 - 8058.96] P:1787.73 E:0.077869 |  Which I think is a great thing and a trait of a top team then
[8059.64 - 8064.92] P:1610.01 E:0.079906 |  Brilliant and I think they've showed that again this evening the intensity of getting after the ball when they've lost it
[8064.92 - 8069.00] P:1416.13 E:0.085761 |  I think Jed Spence did really well with that all the players did well with it Anderson reads it so well
[8069.00 - 8074.16] P:1786.71 E:0.067927 |  So yeah, I think just hone in on being the team that they are right now
[8074.16 - 8077.92] P:1534.82 E:0.079451 |  Keep getting better at what they're doing and they're you know, they're gonna go into that tournament in a good place
[8078.56 - 8081.44] P:1606.04 E:0.103034 |  Matt we're gonna bring in Anthony Gordon now with John Murray
[8081.96 - 8087.62] P:1696.37 E:0.104330 |  Yes, what the man who opened the scoring for England tonight Anthony Gordon has just crept up on my blind side
[8088.68 - 8093.44] P:1389.39 E:0.087711 |  Great to be involved on a night when England qualify for the World Cup. I'm sure Anthony. No amazing
[8093.44 - 8095.44] P:1789.87 E:0.091885 |  There's something I've dreamed of since a kid
[8095.44 - 8100.64] P:1874.65 E:0.085255 |  But we didn't hit me until I got in the changing room seen everyone celebrating because we have a job to doing yourself
[8100.84 - 8105.96] P:1579.27 E:0.087052 |  Focused on doing that so when we're gonna change room, I seen everyone celebrating the music was on yeah, that's gonna hit me
[8105.96 - 8110.76] P:1603.10 E:0.082913 |  Yeah, you said didn't you to us in the build-up to this to these two matches that?
[8111.16 - 8119.08] P:1644.26 E:0.098587 |  You felt you wanted to do more with England and you must feel that you have gone somewhere to delivering that in these last two matches
[8119.08 - 8123.40] P:1594.32 E:0.095035 |  Yes, yeah, I think so. I think definitely the last three performances have been me best for England
[8123.40 - 8128.68] P:1619.40 E:0.090018 |  And I think they've got progressive progressively better, but again, I can't rest on that still feel like I do more
[8128.68 - 8130.68] P:1773.24 E:0.089718 |  I still feel like today I could have scored two
[8130.96 - 8136.00] P:1626.33 E:0.094394 |  God and assist or two so if I want to be a really top-top elite world world-level winger
[8136.00 - 8139.00] P:1470.02 E:0.080445 |  I've got more to do and of course the competition in
[8139.72 - 8145.32] P:1342.97 E:0.099398 |  Your area of the field is intense isn't it and you know, it's now World Cup places. We're talking about yeah
[8145.32 - 8149.80] P:1630.36 E:0.093699 |  I would never any other way. I'm not scared competition at all. I don't mind it. I think it pushes me to be better
[8149.80 - 8154.40] P:1687.14 E:0.089852 |  I think it pushes us all to be better. So definitely not so and I'm scared of and
[8155.16 - 8159.08] P:1531.84 E:0.087942 |  Most on that cherish what would it mean to you to to go to a World Cup?
[8159.44 - 8163.16] P:1498.70 E:0.093915 |  Everything I think every young glad in England dreams of playing in the World Cup for England
[8163.16 - 8167.44] P:1798.85 E:0.090832 |  So there's not many ways you can use to describe that feeling it would it would mean
[8168.32 - 8170.32] P:1827.48 E:0.092709 |  putting on a show to one of them games. So
[8170.88 - 8172.88] P:1539.50 E:0.085396 |  Listen to start in November
[8172.92 - 8179.60] P:1688.00 E:0.088012 |  Actually starts back a club level. So I'm not lost on the competition. I'm not lost on the fact that being successful in the qualifiers
[8180.12 - 8182.52] P:1496.58 E:0.090664 |  Means we go on a plane. That's definitely not the case
[8183.00 - 8185.76] P:1603.36 E:0.091269 |  And he's go back to club perform and get in the next camp
[8186.36 - 8188.36] P:1399.73 E:0.111252 |  Well done tonight and enjoy the moment
[8188.92 - 8193.72] P:1542.29 E:0.098547 |  That's any Gordon. Thank you very much Anthony just disappearing off. Thank you one commitment
[8193.72 - 8196.96] P:1426.14 E:0.099364 |  We've got Thomas to come not a million miles away Kelly as well
[8197.00 - 8201.36] P:1616.65 E:0.105202 |  Shall we should we chat to you while he comes over is it is he that close or what do you want to do?
[8201.36 - 8207.76] P:1660.58 E:0.100218 |  She's not just give us a shot when he's nearby away not far away actually so you can you can chat to me for all your life
[8207.76 - 8214.84] P:1416.70 E:0.109783 |  We've got John stones over in the corner as well who's also doing some talking and you know, there's a really buoyant mood
[8214.84 - 8219.80] P:1650.95 E:0.102474 |  I have to say I thought that was interesting about my aunt here. He comes here. He comes. I will have
[8220.84 - 8224.72] P:1829.30 E:0.080018 |  Congratulations. Congratulations. You've made it look easy
[8225.72 - 8232.98] P:1463.61 E:0.097749 |  Qualification for a World Cup, but it doesn't look easy. It is never easy even if it looks easy and we put a lot of work in
[8233.80 - 8236.80] P:1805.19 E:0.090544 |  Even today again today in the high press
[8237.36 - 8241.96] P:1331.06 E:0.096656 |  They played with a lot of short passes and a lot of short distances in the in the beginning
[8241.96 - 8246.48] P:1655.41 E:0.089015 |  We expected more long balls and the reaction was good. We just kept on investing
[8247.84 - 8249.84] P:1446.23 E:0.076430 |  And and another
[8250.44 - 8258.04] P:1574.86 E:0.085789 |  Another excellent team performance. It's a special moment. It comes rarely that you qualify for a World Cup
[8258.04 - 8260.04] P:1434.56 E:0.069629 |  so the mood is is
[8261.04 - 8268.40] P:1445.48 E:0.093597 |  Very very good, of course in the dressing room is all smiles music and and yeah, it's a moment to enjoy because it's a special moment
[8268.40 - 8272.80] P:1565.01 E:0.108620 |  Yeah, so the celebration will be there. You said you might celebrate like Senegal date, but
[8273.36 - 8278.04] P:1260.27 E:0.097300 |  Almost almost you can see that means a lot and it is it is different and and you cannot
[8278.48 - 8283.80] P:1720.46 E:0.094755 |  Create it artificially that it comes naturally and this so beautiful to see what it means for the players
[8284.60 - 8287.76] P:1520.37 E:0.096049 |  And of course we expect from us to win against Latvia
[8287.76 - 8290.08] P:1173.95 E:0.080676 |  But but the way we won first of all
[8290.52 - 8296.28] P:1711.69 E:0.095318 |  Gives us a lot of satisfaction and then you feel straight away. We did it six six wins six clean sheets
[8296.52 - 8300.80] P:1637.90 E:0.085974 |  We are there and to have this this feeling is a very unique feeling
[8300.80 - 8305.90] P:1785.50 E:0.085903 |  So it's a special special evening and and you can feel it in the stuff and in the players. It's good
[8306.20 - 8308.20] P:1806.96 E:0.095953 |  So how can you turn this to your advantage?
[8308.88 - 8314.64] P:1372.99 E:0.102487 |  Qualifying with two matches to spare you need to give me some time to think about it because I just know it's in half an hour
[8314.64 - 8318.92] P:1393.62 E:0.092104 |  That we're qualified, but we will we will Harry just said in the dressing room
[8318.92 - 8324.56] P:1398.16 E:0.087052 |  Let we will get this let's let's keep this thing going and in November guys when we we no one will
[8325.36 - 8329.52] P:1288.13 E:0.095426 |  Take a rest no one will step back and this is my feeling they're building something
[8329.52 - 8334.76] P:1532.02 E:0.084097 |  We are building something together. I think everyone will be delighted to be back in camp and
[8335.72 - 8338.32] P:1404.53 E:0.082544 |  Yeah, let's see we have some time now to decide but
[8339.04 - 8345.00] P:1804.40 E:0.082315 |  We want to build on what we have of course it feels like you've found a pattern you found your style
[8345.36 - 8348.76] P:1643.47 E:0.106261 |  You measure the two changes tonight so that continuity again
[8349.00 - 8352.88] P:1475.79 E:0.081923 |  And is this style that we've seen in the recent matches
[8352.88 - 8360.32] P:1391.91 E:0.087526 |  Is that a style of football that you will be able to play in the conditions that you will find in the United States?
[8360.60 - 8365.52] P:1613.83 E:0.097357 |  Adapted of course to the conditions it's different if you're playing 40 degrees in the afternoon
[8365.52 - 8370.20] P:1424.44 E:0.100349 |  Or if you play in a in eight degrees and and rain of course
[8370.20 - 8374.96] P:1587.34 E:0.092488 |  And it will come naturally you just cannot sprint and in the same amount
[8374.96 - 8378.52] P:1476.36 E:0.098327 |  You cannot have the same high intensity runs the game itself will be slower
[8379.08 - 8384.12] P:1342.26 E:0.095309 |  But there's I think in a moment. There's no no choice. We do what we do
[8384.12 - 8389.14] P:1494.44 E:0.092920 |  It gives us a good feeling the players buy into it and we play a we play a running game
[8389.14 - 8390.58] P:1342.89 E:0.093934 |  We play a high intensity game
[8390.58 - 8397.38] P:1641.46 E:0.087451 |  I think this reflects the English football culture and the players love it and we will adapt it when it's necessary to adapt
[8397.46 - 8399.46] P:1516.16 E:0.085245 |  We must be very proud of
[8399.62 - 8405.98] P:1586.73 E:0.094019 |  What's being achieved? I know people will say people will say you know look at the quality of the opposition etc etc
[8405.98 - 8411.46] P:1347.77 E:0.088980 |  But still it's 18 points is six clean sheets. So it's good and it's a special moment
[8411.46 - 8415.86] P:1588.07 E:0.088659 |  It's a moment for us no matter if if people might say this was easy
[8416.30 - 8423.06] P:1485.67 E:0.094949 |  If it looks easy it's never easy in football you have to to break down deep blocks again today and the way we did it
[8423.06 - 8427.50] P:1594.79 E:0.076872 |  It's it's nice to see because it's they play with a lot of effort and they just don't
[8427.70 - 8430.90] P:1323.92 E:0.098616 |  Don't just rely on their talent that we will score at some point
[8430.90 - 8435.22] P:1579.96 E:0.087879 |  So we work hard for the goals and for the chances. So it's it's good to see it's a very good moment

[8441.34 - 8448.50] P:1671.82 E:0.096737 |  Thomas Thomas Tuchel just turns away actually and Dan Ashworth and Mark Bullingham are just standing to my right and
[8449.14 - 8454.98] P:1474.96 E:0.101533 |  Debbie Hewitt as well from the FA and they've all given Thomas Tuchel a warm embrace of
[8455.66 - 8457.18] P:1556.22 E:0.046911 |  congratulations
[8457.18 - 8460.98] P:1690.27 E:0.101285 |  John Murray, thank you very much. There will of course be celebrations within
[8461.42 - 8464.46] P:1507.01 E:0.084118 |  The FA setup but also within that England dressing room
[8464.46 - 8469.46] P:1673.48 E:0.092516 |  We heard from Harry Kane from Anthony Gordon and from Thomas Tuchel about the music in the dressing room about the fact
[8469.46 - 8476.02] P:1748.68 E:0.096088 |  The players are all celebrating kind of what was interesting was that Anthony Gordon was so focused on this and so focused on the
[8476.02 - 8477.66] P:1591.66 E:0.104377 |  On the preparation on this hard work
[8477.86 - 8482.90] P:1786.55 E:0.094203 |  There has been a real mantra of Thomas Tuchel's that he said it wasn't till he got in the dressing room that he realized
[8482.90 - 8487.26] P:1362.89 E:0.092455 |  Oh, it's alright. We're allowed to celebrate this. Yeah, first of all, how good John Murray? How good is he?
[8487.26 - 8489.26] P:1259.59 E:0.112428 |  Oh, it's just brilliant, isn't he?
[8489.34 - 8496.42] P:1488.37 E:0.088810 |  But now I play with Anthony Gordon at Everton and his mentality was the same back then even a good few years ago
[8496.42 - 8499.14] P:1759.58 E:0.082526 |  He was a young boy coming through at Everton. He just wants to be the best
[8499.14 - 8501.38] P:1748.04 E:0.091940 |  He wants to if you see if he was sat here now
[8501.46 - 8505.90] P:1735.12 E:0.082622 |  He'd speak without a smile on his face because he's so serious in every aspect when it comes to football
[8505.90 - 8508.50] P:1657.08 E:0.091290 |  And I fully believe what he told us there in that interview
[8508.50 - 8511.46] P:1649.15 E:0.087088 |  I fully believe he was so focused on trying to be the best player on the pitch
[8511.46 - 8516.26] P:1632.48 E:0.091529 |  He will openly tell you that you'll want to be the best player in every opportunity that he can be you mentioned there about
[8516.26 - 8519.74] P:1658.56 E:0.086931 |  He thrives on the competition. I fully believe that so he should enjoy himself
[8519.86 - 8523.62] P:1897.58 E:0.078840 |  It's it's no it's an extraordinary feat to get yourself to a well-cooked
[8523.62 - 8526.42] P:1453.80 E:0.094976 |  So enjoy yourself focus on getting into that next what exactly like he said
[8526.42 - 8527.66] P:1051.31 E:0.103543 |  But he says the right things all the time
[8527.66 - 8531.30] P:1205.74 E:0.081751 |  But he really means it because he was exactly the same a few years ago when I was with him at Everton as well
