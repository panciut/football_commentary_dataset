[0.00 - 4.36] P:1775.38 E:0.060651 |  Against Morocco in the semi-final of the World Cup,
[4.36 - 7.72] P:1725.51 E:0.107297 |  with Argentina and Lionel Messi waiting,
[7.72 - 10.36] P:1743.02 E:0.108108 |  and there is history already,
[10.36 - 14.36] P:1767.04 E:0.109697 |  as Morocco kick-off and get the first touch
[14.36 - 19.20] P:1681.02 E:0.103360 |  for an African team in the last four of a World Cup tournament in this,
[19.20 - 23.84] P:1586.02 E:0.106799 |  as I say, in the 22nd edition of the World Cup finals.
[23.84 - 28.24] P:1711.23 E:0.113172 |  But, Chris Sutton, how much of a blow is that going to be losing again
[28.32 - 32.60] P:1663.40 E:0.109119 |  who was out there warming up, but has had to be replaced before kick-off?
[32.60 - 35.48] P:1685.80 E:0.113798 |  Yeah, it's a massive blow for Morocco.
[35.48 - 38.08] P:1773.66 E:0.112941 |  They can't worry and overthink about that now,
[38.08 - 42.96] P:1723.84 E:0.100634 |  but say one of their first choice defenders now,
[42.96 - 46.20] P:1797.59 E:0.095892 |  just pulling out just pre-kick-off.
[46.20 - 49.00] P:1805.63 E:0.099200 |  As you said, we thought Seiss might have been the one.
[49.00 - 52.80] P:1702.39 E:0.098673 |  He had a rigorous warm-up with the coach on his own.
[53.80 - 58.00] P:2084.28 E:0.112152 |  There is the French on the attack, down the right-hand side with Dempeli,
[58.00 - 60.84] P:2023.46 E:0.105668 |  but he's crossed there with three Moroccan players there,
[60.84 - 65.20] P:1804.36 E:0.103086 |  actually almost in a line, blocking his progress into the penalty area.
[65.20 - 68.36] P:1727.10 E:0.101537 |  And now it's been run away by Amrabat down the left wing,
[68.36 - 72.12] P:2083.55 E:0.101643 |  that France in the shape of Kunde.
[72.12 - 76.04] P:1942.16 E:0.101274 |  The right back is able to dispossess him and then slices the ball out of play.
[76.04 - 79.60] P:1839.84 E:0.095262 |  The referee, incidentally, is from Mexico, and the assistant as well,
[79.64 - 81.08] P:1763.82 E:0.086027 |  says Ramos.
[81.08 - 83.80] P:1798.84 E:0.092801 |  The French team tonight, Lloris Engol,
[83.80 - 86.56] P:1766.16 E:0.097053 |  who we were talking about before the start of the match.
[86.56 - 89.84] P:1712.73 E:0.102076 |  Kunde, Varan, Canate and Teo Hernandez.
[89.84 - 94.12] P:1755.74 E:0.103064 |  Then Yusuf Fafana coming in for Rabi'o,
[94.12 - 97.60] P:1754.34 E:0.101792 |  who's been unwell, like Obama-Carnault, that's why he's not involved.
[97.60 - 99.64] P:1770.93 E:0.103130 |  Trumeni and Griezmann also in the middle,
[99.64 - 101.40] P:1798.93 E:0.091387 |  Dempeli on the right and Batley on the left,
[101.40 - 106.08] P:1984.72 E:0.099157 |  and Giroud through the middle, as Morocco have it,
[106.08 - 108.40] P:1789.45 E:0.085736 |  with Amrabat, middle of the French half,
[108.40 - 111.64] P:1743.89 E:0.087063 |  goes back to the halfway line, Masrawi is there.
[111.64 - 113.60] P:1840.26 E:0.096992 |  He's one of the two players who've come in,
[113.60 - 117.20] P:1769.25 E:0.091332 |  well, three players it is now for Morocco, Masrawi coming in,
[117.20 - 121.24] P:1660.74 E:0.082833 |  and Dari, who has replaced Agheir.
[121.24 - 122.80] P:1846.88 E:0.097965 |  So it is actually two changes,
[122.80 - 125.28] P:1700.26 E:0.087520 |  they've come in for Amala and Atiyat Allah,
[125.28 - 127.36] P:1831.42 E:0.095723 |  who are the two on the bench tonight.
[127.36 - 129.28] P:1855.04 E:0.104142 |  So the ball is at the back,
[129.28 - 133.52] P:1661.68 E:0.085718 |  El Yameek playing as the left-sided central defender,
[133.52 - 137.04] P:1547.90 E:0.098565 |  Saiz in the middle, and Dari on the right-hand side,
[137.16 - 139.56] P:1658.12 E:0.098826 |  Hakimi on the right, Masrawi on the left,
[139.56 - 141.96] P:1626.24 E:0.092334 |  Amrabat and Unahi in the middle,
[141.96 - 146.36] P:1680.76 E:0.099299 |  and then Ziyesh Boufal and Niziri,
[146.36 - 151.76] P:1735.70 E:0.099479 |  the two-goal top scorer for Morocco at this World Cup.
[151.76 - 156.96] P:1793.32 E:0.090785 |  France have conceded one goal in every match they've played at this World Cup,
[156.96 - 160.28] P:1719.51 E:0.080373 |  Morocco have conceded one goal,
[160.28 - 162.00] P:1828.06 E:0.101407 |  and it is Morocco with Saiz,
[162.00 - 164.88] P:1767.82 E:0.086827 |  who plays the ball to the left-hand side, to El Yameek,
[164.92 - 167.76] P:1785.23 E:0.087879 |  and El Yameek will knock it back into centre-field.
[167.76 - 171.16] P:1819.41 E:0.093911 |  And in the first half, Morocco in the red shirts,
[171.16 - 174.44] P:1703.95 E:0.080721 |  the green shorts and the white socks are playing from right to left,
[174.44 - 180.04] P:1626.27 E:0.092787 |  as Weelook and France in the same first-choice colours,
[180.04 - 182.44] P:1696.88 E:0.099272 |  that they downed the English last weekend,
[182.44 - 186.76] P:1654.61 E:0.097221 |  the deep, rich blue shirts with the gold numbers on the back,
[186.76 - 188.68] P:1687.18 E:0.088688 |  white shorts and red socks.
[188.68 - 190.60] P:1744.57 E:0.108187 |  This is a good period of possession for Morocco,
[190.60 - 192.24] P:2048.08 E:0.110175 |  but as I say that, they lose the ball,
[192.24 - 197.92] P:1883.93 E:0.093067 |  but then in steps, Amrabat is able to play it back to his goalkeeper, Bono-Tricil.
[197.92 - 203.84] P:1751.51 E:0.090877 |  I think for us, right, this tournament haven't been overly bothered about
[203.84 - 208.48] P:1721.64 E:0.102663 |  dominating possession, certainly not overly bothered against England.
[208.48 - 213.60] P:1691.70 E:0.100286 |  In the early stages, Moroccan back three, back five,
[213.60 - 217.60] P:1626.03 E:0.087823 |  just going from side to side,
[217.60 - 223.92] P:1856.13 E:0.105201 |  I feel that Zeshin, Bouffal, will be so, so important for the Moroccan team,
[223.92 - 226.32] P:2108.92 E:0.120764 |  in those wider forward areas,
[226.32 - 229.48] P:2106.95 E:0.113375 |  taking the Moroccans up the pitch,
[229.48 - 236.04] P:2079.73 E:0.114526 |  but Morocco's strength in this tournament so far has been to contain
[236.04 - 239.16] P:2075.10 E:0.111939 |  and then to counter and counter at pace.
[239.16 - 240.48] P:2145.74 E:0.118081 |  Well, this is a familiar noise,
[240.48 - 242.44] P:2170.67 E:0.115323 |  if you've been following the Morocco matches,
[242.44 - 246.32] P:2081.92 E:0.109048 |  whenever the opposition have long spells of possession,
[246.40 - 247.56] P:2127.31 E:0.112830 |  you can hear the whistles,
[247.56 - 250.92] P:2131.96 E:0.105951 |  there are thousands and thousands of Morocco fans in the ground,
[250.92 - 254.84] P:2104.26 E:0.110527 |  the FA were giving away an extra 13,000 tickets for this match,
[254.84 - 257.96] P:2079.44 E:0.110828 |  I know there were problems with the flights from Morocco,
[257.96 - 260.00] P:2148.60 E:0.115441 |  so whether they've all made it, I doubt it,
[260.00 - 264.64] P:2068.62 E:0.108206 |  however, it does seem to be pretty close to full capacity,
[264.64 - 267.24] P:2043.43 E:0.103036 |  still the French in possession, in centrefield,
[267.24 - 269.40] P:2021.61 E:0.104600 |  back it comes into the centre circle,
[269.40 - 271.92] P:2090.44 E:0.105015 |  and Faran is there, and right footed,
[271.92 - 274.04] P:1996.55 E:0.107536 |  slips the pass forward to Griezmann,
[274.08 - 276.76] P:2011.37 E:0.112374 |  who's got away into the penalty area on the right-hand side,
[276.76 - 280.00] P:1941.85 E:0.112632 |  plays it across, and Bappé in the area, couldn't get his shot in,
[280.00 - 283.88] P:1861.21 E:0.112059 |  so it's blocked, and then it's hooked in from the angle,
[285.80 - 290.20] P:1657.20 E:0.117759 |  and Tael Hernandez has given France an early lead,
[290.20 - 295.24] P:1696.28 E:0.112108 |  inside five minutes, and Bappé causing a world of problems,
[295.24 - 298.72] P:1590.95 E:0.118578 |  Griezmann got away first, that was crucial to it,
[298.72 - 302.96] P:1547.30 E:0.111520 |  and in the end, Tael Hernandez, quite spectacularly actually,
[303.00 - 305.64] P:1590.86 E:0.111501 |  from an angle on the far side of the penalty area,
[305.64 - 311.28] P:1508.61 E:0.105152 |  left foot, Ferdinand, and it's taken France less than five minutes
[311.28 - 315.00] P:1650.13 E:0.109863 |  to pierce this Moroccan defense, one nil the holders lead.
[315.84 - 318.92] P:1923.23 E:0.113350 |  Yeah, all the talk this tournament has been about,
[318.92 - 322.76] P:1874.75 E:0.105556 |  the Moroccan backline, barely making a mistake,
[322.76 - 325.64] P:1737.09 E:0.103004 |  and it's really poor play from Eliamique,
[325.64 - 328.52] P:1664.54 E:0.098808 |  the left side at the centre half of the three,
[328.52 - 331.32] P:1633.67 E:0.110851 |  tries to nick the ball, get in front of Griezmann,
[331.32 - 334.16] P:1664.89 E:0.107897 |  Griezmann gets the other side, France lies the ball,
[334.16 - 337.24] P:1646.65 E:0.107871 |  and the right-hand channel, and Griezmann tries to pick out,
[337.24 - 340.96] P:1587.85 E:0.100106 |  and Bappé misses with his first strike,
[340.96 - 343.36] P:1600.94 E:0.094247 |  and then with his second strike,
[343.36 - 346.24] P:1687.77 E:0.105658 |  it's a deflected effort, it falls to Hernandez,
[346.24 - 351.64] P:1735.66 E:0.100016 |  and he takes it superbly, gets that left hip up nice and high,
[351.64 - 354.08] P:1662.73 E:0.096297 |  over the ball, from an angle,
[355.36 - 360.08] P:1736.57 E:0.099465 |  past Bono in the Moroccan goal, the perfect start for France.
[361.04 - 363.20] P:1714.51 E:0.107198 |  Just what you want in a match like this.
[363.96 - 367.92] P:1590.00 E:0.094735 |  When the pressure's on, it's the underdogs, what's going to happen?
[367.92 - 371.68] P:1584.18 E:0.098947 |  The longer this match would have gone on without a goal,
[371.68 - 374.28] P:1533.26 E:0.093974 |  the pressure would have increased on France,
[374.28 - 376.84] P:1532.45 E:0.107534 |  but they don't need to worry about that now, Chris.
[376.84 - 378.52] P:1683.76 E:0.107173 |  No, absolutely.
[378.52 - 381.44] P:1804.56 E:0.109898 |  I think that would have been the French intention.
[382.44 - 386.84] P:1739.34 E:0.105984 |  I don't think the Morocco game plan will necessarily change at one nil.
[387.84 - 390.64] P:1662.12 E:0.086653 |  I think they'll be pretty much the same,
[390.64 - 393.16] P:1709.27 E:0.100558 |  they'll still try and contain and counter,
[394.16 - 397.56] P:1606.43 E:0.101745 |  but they give them more to think about, certainly that early goal.
[398.56 - 399.84] P:1695.51 E:0.096825 |  Certainly does.
[399.84 - 402.20] P:1620.16 E:0.108115 |  France won, Morocco nil.
[402.20 - 405.40] P:1656.32 E:0.101552 |  Just thinking as well, you know, that the initial pass
[405.40 - 407.84] P:1598.07 E:0.097162 |  that El Yameek went for,
[407.84 - 409.96] P:1466.68 E:0.096623 |  and you say, I had a gage,
[409.96 - 413.80] P:1617.22 E:0.100358 |  pinned in to play on the left side of the three central defenders,
[413.80 - 415.32] P:1571.23 E:0.099481 |  he's not there,
[415.32 - 417.72] P:1544.58 E:0.097259 |  and then El Yameek diving in,
[417.72 - 420.16] P:1657.33 E:0.102923 |  Griezmann turned and got away from him,
[420.16 - 422.00] P:1664.41 E:0.103819 |  beating him into the area.
[422.00 - 426.40] P:1739.70 E:0.110694 |  And to give Griezmann space like that inside the penalty area,
[426.40 - 430.52] P:1745.17 E:0.101105 |  when that's been such a premium for their opponents
[430.52 - 433.52] P:1896.12 E:0.114401 |  all the way through this World Cup, that's felt danger.
[433.52 - 437.04] P:1909.53 E:0.116714 |  It was Baran who stepped in with the ball
[437.04 - 438.72] P:1902.96 E:0.119179 |  that right side of the centre,
[438.72 - 441.12] P:1906.91 E:0.107687 |  half-four France, it's a simple pass,
[441.12 - 444.60] P:1799.13 E:0.108834 |  but El Yameek dives in, clever run from Griezmann,
[445.36 - 447.72] P:1676.38 E:0.107699 |  but you can't dive in in that situation
[447.72 - 450.40] P:1679.50 E:0.108688 |  unless you are 100% that you can win the ball.
[450.40 - 453.12] P:1798.41 E:0.108728 |  Griezmann got the other side, that was a big mistake.
[453.12 - 455.00] P:1777.26 E:0.119228 |  So now what can Morocco do?
[455.00 - 456.60] P:1795.54 E:0.113233 |  And they're bringing the ball forward
[456.60 - 459.00] P:1786.93 E:0.107071 |  up towards the edge of the penalty area with Hakimi.
[459.00 - 460.60] P:1736.68 E:0.107759 |  Bounces back to Zierke,
[460.60 - 463.60] P:1938.32 E:0.118460 |  rather threw himself to ground, wanted a free kick for that.
[463.60 - 465.80] P:2047.99 E:0.113479 |  They're absolutely howling for it down there
[465.80 - 467.80] P:2100.38 E:0.111291 |  in the red shirts with the green star,
[467.80 - 469.76] P:2077.19 E:0.112719 |  but now it's France who break away,
[469.76 - 472.60] P:2101.82 E:0.108824 |  and it's Mbappe left side into the penalty area,
[472.80 - 475.20] P:2039.60 E:0.105387 |  plays it across, it's deflected into the D,
[475.20 - 478.20] P:2065.82 E:0.101987 |  and then actually stabbed back by Dembele,
[478.20 - 481.60] P:2067.14 E:0.113356 |  intercept the field, but Morocco very quickly back in possession.
[481.60 - 483.40] P:2076.31 E:0.105251 |  That wasn't a free kick, was it?
[483.40 - 484.60] P:2016.83 E:0.120226 |  The challenge on? No, it wasn't.
[484.60 - 489.20] P:2093.56 E:0.115645 |  Zierswet down far too easily, but Alain Bell's ringing
[489.20 - 493.60] P:2061.50 E:0.105846 |  when Mbappe facing up Amrabat,
[493.60 - 495.60] P:2014.63 E:0.113052 |  actually on that left-hand side for Branson,
[495.60 - 498.20] P:1823.08 E:0.114580 |  Moroccan right, one-by-one situation,
[498.20 - 499.60] P:1639.70 E:0.102249 |  but didn't make anything of that.
[499.60 - 501.60] P:1672.18 E:0.105443 |  This is five-live from the BBC,
[501.60 - 503.20] P:1563.64 E:0.105875 |  listening as well on BBC Sound,
[503.20 - 505.60] P:1664.82 E:0.111863 |  we're across Africa on the World Service as well,
[505.60 - 507.60] P:1743.42 E:0.105004 |  so good evening Casablanca,
[507.60 - 510.60] P:1768.59 E:0.109548 |  as the Moroccan side come forward with Zierswet,
[510.60 - 513.20] P:1736.86 E:0.104820 |  over hits the pass beyond Hakimi,
[513.20 - 515.60] P:1688.92 E:0.108294 |  and it runs through for a goal kick.
[515.60 - 517.60] P:1618.55 E:0.106453 |  And back home, if you're on your way home,
[517.60 - 520.00] P:1595.08 E:0.099544 |  this match is on BBC One tonight,
[520.00 - 522.60] P:1706.72 E:0.101609 |  so you can watch it there or on the iPlayer,
[522.60 - 526.60] P:1748.82 E:0.111007 |  and as for every match at this World Cup live on BBC TV,
[526.60 - 531.40] P:1758.05 E:0.110399 |  you can watch while listening to our five-live radio commentary
[531.40 - 534.40] P:1802.39 E:0.103674 |  if you search for World Cup Extra.
[534.40 - 537.40] P:1753.25 E:0.105475 |  And the television pictures and the five-live commentary
[537.40 - 539.40] P:1843.06 E:0.108159 |  will be all synced up together,
[539.40 - 543.40] P:1949.83 E:0.112201 |  and the same will apply for Sunday's World Cup final, of course,
[543.40 - 547.40] P:2075.04 E:0.110760 |  which at the moment will be Argentina against France.
[547.40 - 549.40] P:2084.67 E:0.109091 |  Three o'clock kickoff, by the way, on Sunday,
[549.40 - 551.40] P:2077.84 E:0.107059 |  don't get caught out by that.
[551.40 - 553.40] P:1985.85 E:0.105867 |  Three o'clock back home, six o'clock here,
[553.40 - 555.40] P:1787.47 E:0.105696 |  that will be something of a relief,
[555.40 - 558.40] P:1742.65 E:0.092960 |  as Morocco come through the middle,
[558.40 - 560.40] P:1594.08 E:0.096565 |  but France are able to clear it away downfield to Bono.
[560.40 - 563.40] P:1698.71 E:0.098353 |  And there's poor link-up play, actually, from Olivier Giroud.
[563.40 - 566.40] P:1694.65 E:0.106591 |  He's had a brilliant tournament so far, but careless with the pass,
[566.40 - 572.40] P:1742.98 E:0.094845 |  and CES then took a heavy touch, which tempted Canate.
[572.40 - 575.40] P:1751.59 E:0.107841 |  And he still begins to open the Mekano shoes this evening,
[575.40 - 577.40] P:1808.69 E:0.108412 |  and he made a crucial challenge.
[577.40 - 579.40] P:1841.98 E:0.118827 |  This could open up for Morocco.
[579.40 - 582.40] P:1809.55 E:0.116012 |  Curling shot, de Gloris has to go down to his left.
[582.40 - 586.40] P:1888.51 E:0.105703 |  Unahi took it on 25 yards, I would say,
[586.40 - 589.40] P:1745.45 E:0.111597 |  given the angle on the left-hand side, right-foot shot.
[589.40 - 591.40] P:1739.94 E:0.111701 |  That was fighting the bottom corner,
[591.40 - 594.40] P:1758.79 E:0.110019 |  and Lloris leaping to his left, palmed it away.
[594.40 - 596.40] P:1733.00 E:0.103670 |  That's a terrific response from Morocco.
[596.40 - 599.40] P:1737.19 E:0.104426 |  All of 25 yards out, left-hand side of the box,
[599.40 - 601.40] P:1719.49 E:0.109520 |  trying to bend the ball in the far corner.
[601.40 - 604.40] P:1915.24 E:0.095958 |  Maurice got down to his left-hand side,
[604.40 - 608.40] P:2020.13 E:0.105650 |  as a save you'd expect him to make, but certainly worked then.
[609.40 - 611.40] P:1861.05 E:0.113894 |  Morocco inside the French half.
[611.40 - 613.40] P:1794.86 E:0.101368 |  Back it goes to the half-way line.
[613.40 - 618.40] P:1746.24 E:0.092609 |  El Yameek, just a little pass at close quarters to Unahi.
[619.40 - 622.40] P:1744.24 E:0.095177 |  And then forward to Bouffal.
[622.40 - 626.40] P:1795.88 E:0.112410 |  Hakini gets it back to Bouffal, who is challenged.
[628.40 - 629.40] P:1976.38 E:0.122731 |  And there's no free kick for that.
[629.40 - 631.40] P:2023.86 E:0.118691 |  Looked like a clean challenge, I must say.
[631.40 - 633.40] P:2052.53 E:0.118583 |  And we were trying to be able to bring it away.
[633.40 - 637.40] P:2082.90 E:0.109357 |  I think that was a free kick, Bouffal giving the assistant
[637.40 - 639.40] P:2043.92 E:0.107794 |  an ear bashing there.
[639.40 - 641.40] P:2012.56 E:0.119099 |  Looks like there was enough contact there.
[641.40 - 643.40] P:2012.47 E:0.113365 |  Dembele, just gives it to Griezmann,
[643.40 - 645.40] P:2034.12 E:0.114706 |  sent a field Griezmann, left-footed pass.
[645.40 - 648.40] P:1936.37 E:0.118114 |  He's looking for him back there, he went for him very, very easily.
[649.40 - 652.40] P:1838.13 E:0.104973 |  Come on, Killian, you're better than that.
[652.40 - 655.40] P:1857.01 E:0.111554 |  Hakini was with him, the two of them together.
[655.40 - 663.40] P:1862.88 E:0.106665 |  Whether there was the tiniest brush of an arm in back-a or not.
[663.40 - 667.40] P:1713.38 E:0.099857 |  Team-mates or not, I think that's poor from in back-a.
[667.40 - 671.40] P:1487.31 E:0.103422 |  Made a run on the inside of Hakini.
[671.40 - 674.40] P:1692.34 E:0.114188 |  Slightest contact, he may have been offside anyway.
[674.40 - 676.40] P:1635.05 E:0.107525 |  Just watching that Larisse save.
[677.40 - 680.40] P:1640.11 E:0.122838 |  Elected to go with the one hand, maybe could have thought it.
[680.40 - 682.40] P:1660.79 E:0.109771 |  I think it made a bit of a meal of that.
[683.40 - 687.40] P:1649.31 E:0.110499 |  You won't see those calls, Chris, these days.
[687.40 - 690.40] P:1870.76 E:0.117077 |  Depends on how your bar is, John.
[690.40 - 695.40] P:2023.44 E:0.115709 |  Yes, Kunde, flicked in field by Tumani, Griezmann gets there ahead of Tia.
[695.40 - 697.40] P:2037.15 E:0.115332 |  This is still inside the French half.
[697.40 - 701.40] P:2065.06 E:0.114484 |  Now he has the goal scorer, Tio Hernandez on the left-hand side.
[701.40 - 704.40] P:2131.94 E:0.115190 |  That was his second goal for France.
[704.40 - 708.40] P:2120.49 E:0.113557 |  The one that he hooked in at waist-high, wasn't it?
[708.40 - 712.40] P:2100.66 E:0.113255 |  He still had to thread it past Bono, came out from his six-yard box
[712.40 - 715.40] P:2096.75 E:0.114922 |  and there was a defender on the line, but he managed to find the target.
[715.40 - 722.40] P:2064.34 E:0.110672 |  So Tio Hernandez, the full-back scoring the goal, crucially for France.
[722.40 - 728.40] P:2072.75 E:0.112518 |  Remember the full-back scoring both goals in the 1998 semi-final,
[728.40 - 732.40] P:2064.87 E:0.118435 |  the World Cup semi-final, Lilian Turan, who was until just a few days ago,
[732.40 - 734.40] P:2068.88 E:0.115566 |  France's most-capped player.
[734.40 - 737.40] P:1983.00 E:0.115591 |  Here is Griezmann down the right-hand side.
[737.40 - 740.40] P:1881.67 E:0.117183 |  I thought he might have got a shove in the back there,
[740.40 - 742.40] P:1738.03 E:0.108006 |  but the assistant is not having that either.
[742.40 - 745.40] P:1726.96 E:0.104327 |  Another official, it's a throw-in to Morocco.
[745.40 - 748.40] P:1617.11 E:0.112815 |  There's a lot of you go, hasn't he? The referee, I think Griezmann,
[748.40 - 751.40] P:1681.29 E:0.103864 |  just pulling out on that wide right-hand side,
[751.40 - 755.40] P:1682.97 E:0.104612 |  you'll see him drift everywhere in his search for the ball.
[755.40 - 758.40] P:1740.46 E:0.089960 |  The other side of Bouffal drew the foul.
[758.40 - 762.40] P:1898.57 E:0.120316 |  It's been given away, that was a poor touch from André back,
[762.40 - 764.40] P:1917.84 E:0.110480 |  but France can't take advantage.
[764.40 - 766.40] P:1863.57 E:0.100151 |  And it's out of play on the far side.
[766.40 - 770.40] P:1748.78 E:0.094150 |  The referee just coming across and having a word with Sice,
[770.40 - 773.40] P:1714.14 E:0.105286 |  not sure what that was about particularly.
[773.40 - 777.40] P:1636.16 E:0.099400 |  So there's clearly a doubt over Sice's fitness.
[777.40 - 780.40] P:1700.08 E:0.097775 |  If you've just switched on, big blow for Morocco,
[780.40 - 783.40] P:1758.50 E:0.101709 |  a guerd of West Ham, who's, of course,
[783.40 - 785.40] P:1664.90 E:0.106060 |  just had all manner of problems with injury
[785.40 - 787.40] P:1672.44 E:0.110819 |  since he signed for West Ham last summer.
[787.40 - 790.40] P:1635.90 E:0.111522 |  He's injured three seasons, match against Rangers, wasn't it,
[790.40 - 793.40] P:1586.09 E:0.112942 |  that he was injured and has barely played for West Ham,
[793.40 - 797.40] P:1723.73 E:0.109533 |  now ruled out of the World Cup semi-finals shortly before kick-off.
[797.40 - 799.40] P:1761.66 E:0.097711 |  You have to feel for him.
[799.40 - 804.40] P:1700.12 E:0.102712 |  And without him, Morocco going down 1-0 in the first five minutes.
[804.40 - 808.40] P:1545.55 E:0.102283 |  So here's Unahi out to the right-hand side,
[808.40 - 812.40] P:1630.87 E:0.114468 |  just kept in by Hakim, the Paris Saint-Germain,
[812.40 - 815.40] P:1607.86 E:0.101748 |  crosses the half-way, that gives it to Zee Esch,
[815.40 - 818.40] P:1557.37 E:0.104969 |  with Chelsea, with Théo Hernandez,
[818.40 - 820.40] P:1619.25 E:0.116762 |  forces him back into his own half.
[820.40 - 826.40] P:1588.91 E:0.102286 |  And it's returned to Sice in the middle-man role
[826.40 - 828.40] P:1548.67 E:0.106291 |  of the three central defenders.
[828.40 - 831.40] P:1502.12 E:0.103097 |  The number six who was born in France, Romain Sice.
[831.40 - 835.40] P:1634.20 E:0.106916 |  Basik Das now after his long spell with Wolves.
[835.40 - 839.40] P:1675.73 E:0.110721 |  That looks like a foul on Zee Esch and Hakimi,
[839.40 - 841.40] P:1692.49 E:0.114225 |  and the referee does agree with that.
[841.40 - 844.40] P:1703.18 E:0.106188 |  And now it's to Morocco, 10 yards inside French territory.
[844.40 - 848.40] P:1747.99 E:0.112199 |  We're just seeing Hakimi, and they've set up,
[848.40 - 852.40] P:1787.59 E:0.106296 |  but he's the right wing-banker coming in in that inverted position.
[852.40 - 856.40] P:1940.89 E:0.110113 |  He's got a little overload in the middle of the park.
[856.40 - 861.40] P:1903.16 E:0.105751 |  Opportunity for Morocco now, centre-half's gone forward.
[861.40 - 865.40] P:1843.63 E:0.104708 |  Three-kick, halfway into the French half.
[865.40 - 868.40] P:1712.37 E:0.102446 |  Three-kick out towards the right-hand side,
[868.40 - 871.40] P:1624.69 E:0.095088 |  and about 10 yards inside French territory,
[871.40 - 874.40] P:1673.99 E:0.107275 |  translating 1-0, and the delivery left-footed
[874.40 - 877.40] P:1728.01 E:0.107308 |  towards the penalty spot, but that's high,
[877.40 - 882.40] P:1977.00 E:0.105467 |  and headed away across the penalty area by Canate,
[882.40 - 886.40] P:2046.00 E:0.117972 |  who's coming for the French side for Mccano today.
[886.40 - 889.40] P:2048.04 E:0.112984 |  Faurico's Dembele now gets the ball down under the playing surface
[889.40 - 892.40] P:2063.25 E:0.117093 |  and runs away from the centre-circle to the right.
[892.40 - 897.40] P:2101.46 E:0.116844 |  Hakimi goes to Romaini, who was doubtful for this game, remember.
[897.40 - 901.40] P:2072.78 E:0.118168 |  Had a little bit of a calf problem, but has been passed through.
[901.40 - 905.40] P:2077.31 E:0.119345 |  The man who scored the opening goal against England in this stadium,
[905.40 - 907.40] P:2105.02 E:0.118184 |  in the quarter-final.
[907.40 - 910.40] P:2090.63 E:0.117724 |  Dembele back to the halfway line, and now for Varan.
[910.40 - 914.40] P:2066.77 E:0.116428 |  Varan turns and comes forward, but Richard's ahead of him,
[914.40 - 917.40] P:2141.64 E:0.115224 |  so turns it back to Cundé behind him,
[917.40 - 921.40] P:2057.69 E:0.120754 |  and then a little pass again to Varan on the halfway line.
[921.40 - 923.40] P:2048.87 E:0.123842 |  Not a great deal of movement ahead of him,
[923.40 - 927.40] P:2051.55 E:0.119755 |  but the French have got that early secular, the early opening goal.
[927.40 - 933.40] P:1996.50 E:0.120095 |  15 minutes played now, and Cundé going in for the tackle
[933.40 - 938.40] P:2046.76 E:0.118646 |  in the centre-circle to keep the ball for the defending champions.
[938.40 - 942.40] P:2032.08 E:0.118176 |  The two-times World Cup winners, three-times finalists.
[942.40 - 947.40] P:2048.49 E:0.117860 |  Cundé now to Fafana, Fafana of Monaco, to Hernandez,
[947.40 - 950.40] P:1937.15 E:0.122192 |  Inter and Bafé ran towards the ball, sprint,
[950.40 - 953.40] P:1818.66 E:0.116899 |  but as he got there a heavy touch, thanks to it,
[953.40 - 956.40] P:1630.07 E:0.108178 |  Monaco were able to take possession again,
[956.40 - 960.40] P:1767.24 E:0.119351 |  pass it forward centrally, and that's nicely done by Bouffal,
[960.40 - 962.40] P:1824.99 E:0.119161 |  and Bouffal plays it to the edge of the box,
[962.40 - 966.40] P:1765.41 E:0.108766 |  and Cies were the shot, but he was falling as he did so,
[966.40 - 968.40] P:1604.17 E:0.107654 |  as the challenge came in on him,
[968.40 - 973.40] P:1670.10 E:0.113246 |  and he was only able to shovel it wide and behind for a goal kick.
[973.40 - 976.40] P:1660.94 E:0.111726 |  And that's the Monaco danger from one end to the other.
[976.40 - 979.40] P:1726.22 E:0.101691 |  Lovely turn in the middle of the park from Bouffal.
[979.40 - 983.40] P:1766.40 E:0.104657 |  Let the ball run across his body and is away from Fafana,
[983.40 - 986.40] P:1820.48 E:0.104011 |  and he slides the ball out to the right-hand side,
[986.40 - 988.40] P:1839.59 E:0.100954 |  but he has just off balance.
[988.40 - 990.40] P:1899.21 E:0.091798 |  It was a weak-time effort.
[990.40 - 993.40] P:1920.99 E:0.119159 |  Oh, now Giroud has gone away, that was poor defensively,
[993.40 - 997.40] P:1857.25 E:0.106578 |  and Giroud smacks the shot into the outside of the post,
[997.40 - 1000.40] P:1806.33 E:0.098548 |  and it bounces away wide.
[1000.40 - 1006.40] P:1795.25 E:0.096696 |  Well, the big man, the great man, Francis Records,
[1006.40 - 1011.40] P:1703.01 E:0.102162 |  scores up, pulls the front of his blue shirt up right over his face.
[1011.40 - 1016.40] P:1683.49 E:0.095389 |  He hit it extremely well, but post and wide.
[1016.40 - 1019.40] P:1691.31 E:0.105447 |  Oh, he did, he caught it absolutely flush.
[1019.40 - 1024.40] P:1727.23 E:0.089727 |  It's just one long ball, awful defending from Cies.
[1024.40 - 1027.40] P:1563.83 E:0.103342 |  It was Canato, who clipped the ball into the left-hand channel,
[1027.40 - 1030.40] P:1635.31 E:0.105080 |  bounce once over Cies's head, and then Giroud
[1030.40 - 1035.40] P:1586.66 E:0.091286 |  drives into the left-hand side of the box and hammers the ball.
[1035.40 - 1038.40] P:1624.76 E:0.105252 |  They're footed against the post, just goes for power.
[1038.40 - 1043.40] P:1501.05 E:0.095833 |  Pono wasn't getting to that, let off from Morocco,
[1043.40 - 1045.40] P:1818.00 E:0.101495 |  but Cies is really struggling.
[1045.40 - 1047.40] P:1634.89 E:0.088590 |  He's struggling, that's another moment there.
[1047.40 - 1051.40] P:1675.09 E:0.098857 |  This is unlike them, isn't it, at this tournament to be open,
[1051.40 - 1053.40] P:1626.57 E:0.092823 |  but firstly in the way that they were for the goal,
[1053.40 - 1058.40] P:1549.03 E:0.090740 |  and then there was a misjudgment of the bouncing ball.
[1058.40 - 1063.40] P:1583.36 E:0.097260 |  Yeah, I mean, that ball travelled, what, 60 yards?
[1063.40 - 1070.40] P:1584.96 E:0.111062 |  I think he would read that 99 times over 100 situations,
[1070.40 - 1074.40] P:1528.21 E:0.115269 |  but he's carrying an injury, and this is the worst-case scenario
[1074.40 - 1076.40] P:1546.66 E:0.108306 |  with Morocco.
[1076.40 - 1078.40] P:1696.93 E:0.121120 |  It is, and if you make mistakes like that,
[1078.40 - 1081.40] P:1703.30 E:0.105593 |  if you give France those opportunities,
[1081.40 - 1083.40] P:1741.19 E:0.111924 |  they're not going to miss all the time,
[1083.40 - 1086.40] P:1838.92 E:0.116640 |  and the ball just bouncing out of play for throwing
[1086.40 - 1089.40] P:1991.65 E:0.116576 |  to France half inside the run-half.
[1089.40 - 1092.40] P:2073.15 E:0.121047 |  So France won, Morocco nailed it to the radio by flight.
[1092.40 - 1095.40] P:2086.75 E:0.118128 |  Here, up to the north of Doha, that's where we are.
[1095.40 - 1098.40] P:2076.69 E:0.110558 |  First time you've been in this stadium, Chris.
[1098.40 - 1101.40] P:1871.38 E:0.105598 |  I've been here more than once, as the ball is played to the right,
[1101.40 - 1105.40] P:1675.68 E:0.112238 |  but it is a striking place to come to, I must say.
[1105.40 - 1111.40] P:1713.64 E:0.102258 |  As you drive up into the darkness, it's so flat here,
[1111.40 - 1113.40] P:1353.21 E:0.098762 |  you can see for miles and miles in certain directions,
[1113.40 - 1116.40] P:1612.55 E:0.105581 |  there are just no lights at all.
[1116.40 - 1121.40] P:1720.86 E:0.114577 |  And here, it is Morocco coming forward with Una'i,
[1121.40 - 1124.40] P:1529.93 E:0.110493 |  then back to Amrabat, now on the right-hand side.
[1124.40 - 1126.40] P:1588.59 E:0.114309 |  Morocco one-nil down.
[1126.40 - 1129.40] P:1682.40 E:0.116714 |  This is the first time they've been behind at this World Cup.
[1129.40 - 1132.40] P:1851.74 E:0.118745 |  Deep cross from the right from Hapini,
[1132.40 - 1134.40] P:1936.12 E:0.118081 |  but it's easily caught by Lois,
[1134.40 - 1136.40] P:2012.10 E:0.117127 |  who is just under the couldn.
[1136.40 - 1138.40] P:2100.53 E:0.114684 |  Unflappable, and catching calmly,
[1138.40 - 1141.40] P:2127.46 E:0.114964 |  and under on the ball out to the right back.
[1141.40 - 1143.40] P:2106.75 E:0.117861 |  Romain size, gesturing to the bench,
[1143.40 - 1146.40] P:2140.74 E:0.110264 |  get me off, get me off quickly.
[1146.40 - 1150.40] P:2131.12 E:0.116241 |  It really isn't ideal, so the gamble's not worked then.
[1150.40 - 1151.40] P:2048.14 E:0.119484 |  Absolutely not.
[1151.40 - 1155.40] P:2095.03 E:0.113616 |  We saw him in the warm-up, there was that concern.
[1155.40 - 1158.40] P:2089.93 E:0.113529 |  You get it though, you get it that he wants to play.
[1158.40 - 1162.40] P:2089.49 E:0.105775 |  Such a huge game.
[1162.40 - 1166.40] P:2060.05 E:0.115321 |  And fortunately, he'll be taking an early bath,
[1166.40 - 1171.40] P:2057.26 E:0.112890 |  and they're going to miss more leadership at the back.
[1171.40 - 1174.40] P:2069.29 E:0.115466 |  They'll guard off, size will be off,
[1174.40 - 1179.40] P:2074.09 E:0.109138 |  and then an experienced back line against a team,
[1179.40 - 1184.40] P:2065.45 E:0.114289 |  as formidable as the French, and spells trouble for Magarene.
[1184.40 - 1187.40] P:2092.48 E:0.112967 |  Here's Durand, playing it through the middle,
[1187.40 - 1190.40] P:2020.35 E:0.122720 |  little flick from him, and Bapé comes across,
[1190.40 - 1192.40] P:1938.23 E:0.118520 |  gives it to Griezmann,
[1192.40 - 1197.40] P:1858.62 E:0.114236 |  but Bapé in his enthusiasm and his exuberance to get the ball,
[1197.40 - 1200.40] P:1854.50 E:0.107465 |  actually went through the ball,
[1200.40 - 1202.40] P:1859.19 E:0.121421 |  and has actually fouled El Yamee,
[1202.40 - 1204.40] P:1956.85 E:0.121279 |  and it's a great kick to Morocco.
[1204.40 - 1206.40] P:1951.84 E:0.120197 |  And he was having a heart, wasn't he?
[1206.40 - 1211.40] P:1989.44 E:0.113517 |  Clever play from Giroud, the ball fist into him,
[1211.40 - 1214.40] P:1766.82 E:0.109204 |  and just played the ball with the outside of his boot,
[1214.40 - 1216.40] P:1710.57 E:0.102444 |  to round the corner to him, Bapé,
[1216.40 - 1218.40] P:1683.48 E:0.113618 |  he fed it back and then made the run,
[1218.40 - 1221.40] P:1725.43 E:0.107617 |  and trod on, and he makes foot,
[1221.40 - 1224.40] P:1748.14 E:0.106589 |  and it does hurt, John, if someone stands on your feet.
[1224.40 - 1225.40] P:1748.13 E:0.110751 |  I'm sure it does.
[1225.40 - 1228.40] P:1685.88 E:0.102082 |  Well, that's it, 20 minutes, and the captain,
[1228.40 - 1231.40] P:1611.25 E:0.102774 |  the French-born captain, Romain Sais,
[1231.40 - 1232.40] P:1684.91 E:0.113333 |  he can't go on any longer.
[1232.40 - 1235.40] P:1669.06 E:0.109339 |  I think that last moment, when Giroud got away from him so easily,
[1236.40 - 1238.40] P:1728.93 E:0.107784 |  I think that he's had to make the decision,
[1238.40 - 1240.40] P:1646.36 E:0.106684 |  Morocco have had to make the decision,
[1240.40 - 1242.40] P:1675.82 E:0.103681 |  and he's replaced by the number...
[1245.40 - 1246.40] P:1616.26 E:0.123275 |  Who is it, who's coming?
[1246.40 - 1247.40] P:1586.98 E:0.114987 |  The Marlott.
[1247.40 - 1248.40] P:1621.72 E:0.102867 |  The Marlott coming on, the number 15,
[1248.40 - 1249.40] P:1647.67 E:0.101838 |  sell him a Marlott.
[1249.40 - 1251.40] P:1623.04 E:0.097547 |  So it'll be a change of shape.
[1251.40 - 1253.40] P:1354.53 E:0.102889 |  Yeah, back four now, presumably.
[1254.40 - 1257.40] P:1338.21 E:0.103976 |  So they lose Aguierre just before the match,
[1257.40 - 1259.40] P:1375.52 E:0.087841 |  they've lost Sais after 20 minutes,
[1259.40 - 1260.40] P:1343.64 E:0.101847 |  they're one nil down,
[1260.40 - 1262.40] P:1496.61 E:0.099381 |  the French have got their tails up.
[1263.40 - 1266.40] P:1573.76 E:0.110391 |  And they have, yeah, I mean, you look at the centre half,
[1266.40 - 1269.40] P:1436.90 E:0.102209 |  pairing, so inexperienced.
[1270.40 - 1272.40] P:1555.68 E:0.107106 |  They're going to have to deal with
[1273.40 - 1278.40] P:1689.94 E:0.112775 |  Olivia Giroud, who is so cute, so clever, so sharp,
[1279.40 - 1280.40] P:1468.89 E:0.114467 |  with his movement.
[1283.40 - 1286.40] P:1448.69 E:0.111116 |  So Salim Amala, the third standard liais, is coming on.
[1286.40 - 1289.40] P:1569.14 E:0.108665 |  He has started four of the matches in midfield.
[1289.40 - 1292.40] P:1683.75 E:0.107947 |  So this actually now looks, in terms of the formation,
[1292.40 - 1295.40] P:1604.15 E:0.099256 |  the system, it actually looks more familiar
[1295.40 - 1297.40] P:1627.48 E:0.108453 |  to this Morocco side that has made progress
[1297.40 - 1298.40] P:1689.04 E:0.107993 |  to the semi-finals.
[1298.40 - 1300.40] P:1639.89 E:0.102667 |  But they've one nil down,
[1300.40 - 1304.40] P:1843.18 E:0.111553 |  and they have now the size no Aguierre
[1304.40 - 1306.40] P:2047.93 E:0.107872 |  in central defence.
[1306.40 - 1307.40] P:2078.59 E:0.106627 |  France in possession,
[1307.40 - 1309.40] P:2073.44 E:0.119983 |  and it is Canate of Liverpool,
[1309.40 - 1311.40] P:2066.39 E:0.119016 |  he's playing as the left-sided central defender.
[1311.40 - 1313.40] P:2053.46 E:0.113762 |  They did start together these two against Chinnes,
[1313.40 - 1315.40] P:2088.29 E:0.116501 |  he had a match that France lost.
[1315.40 - 1317.40] P:2097.22 E:0.109942 |  He has Hernandez on the left-hand side,
[1317.40 - 1321.40] P:2096.20 E:0.117751 |  the goal scorer, mentioned the fact that he scored in a semi-final,
[1321.40 - 1324.40] P:2107.33 E:0.120850 |  and that Liliyentouram scored in the semi-final,
[1324.40 - 1327.40] P:2067.92 E:0.118902 |  and in the semi-final four years ago,
[1327.40 - 1329.40] P:2053.05 E:0.122044 |  it was Umtiti who scored the only goal.
[1329.40 - 1331.40] P:1852.78 E:0.115656 |  So another defender who scored in that one.
[1332.40 - 1336.40] P:1728.83 E:0.104529 |  And the ball at the back with Masraoui of Bayern Munich.
[1337.40 - 1340.40] P:1689.05 E:0.108315 |  So in central defence with El Yameek now playing
[1340.40 - 1342.40] P:1526.64 E:0.113625 |  as the left-sided of two,
[1343.40 - 1346.40] P:1584.68 E:0.105493 |  forward into the centre circle, where Zeeh comes
[1346.40 - 1350.40] P:1615.78 E:0.120235 |  and then turns and gives the ball out to Hakini,
[1350.40 - 1352.40] P:1672.86 E:0.115339 |  who's on the right wing.
[1352.40 - 1354.40] P:1594.68 E:0.118711 |  Bouffal is there as well,
[1354.40 - 1357.40] P:1632.35 E:0.109635 |  Bouffal lobal towards the edge of the box,
[1357.40 - 1358.40] P:1585.97 E:0.109482 |  where the Nuli arrived,
[1358.40 - 1362.40] P:1530.15 E:0.106302 |  and Mala was there, now it's back again with Hakini.
[1363.40 - 1366.40] P:1595.94 E:0.119553 |  And then Mala,
[1366.40 - 1368.40] P:1542.59 E:0.121787 |  little ball in towards the edge of the penalty area,
[1368.40 - 1370.40] P:1662.81 E:0.119841 |  Mala tried to return it,
[1370.40 - 1373.40] P:1856.57 E:0.116528 |  and there's the foul in there against the French.
[1373.40 - 1375.40] P:1954.62 E:0.111370 |  The French foul on Hernandez,
[1375.40 - 1377.40] P:1968.76 E:0.111260 |  three picked the French in their own left-back position,
[1377.40 - 1379.40] P:1993.22 E:0.109782 |  one-nil France lead.
[1379.40 - 1382.40] P:1921.26 E:0.110188 |  Yeah, Hakini there on Hernandez,
[1382.40 - 1384.40] P:1883.87 E:0.099351 |  I think it was a foul.
[1384.40 - 1386.40] P:1824.38 E:0.110370 |  Hernandez getting his body in.
[1387.40 - 1389.40] P:1930.68 E:0.108346 |  In fact, there's Bouffal,
[1389.40 - 1392.40] P:1985.04 E:0.120402 |  just catches him in the ankle and goes over,
[1392.40 - 1394.40] P:2061.48 E:0.113284 |  Hakini was there to pick the ball up.
[1395.40 - 1398.40] P:2029.99 E:0.117308 |  It's sort of the perfect scenario for the French this, isn't it?
[1398.40 - 1401.40] P:2119.71 E:0.108213 |  They can control the game,
[1401.40 - 1405.40] P:2113.42 E:0.113782 |  trying to lure the Moroccan forwards
[1405.40 - 1407.40] P:2171.61 E:0.111135 |  into the ball play random.
[1408.40 - 1410.40] P:2115.86 E:0.105795 |  Lille?
[1412.40 - 1414.40] P:2143.83 E:0.115597 |  Lille?
[1414.40 - 1417.40] P:2133.56 E:0.118235 |  France leading Morocco by one goal to no.
[1417.40 - 1422.40] P:2130.68 E:0.113542 |  Let's see if they're able to lure them into their trap.
[1422.40 - 1425.40] P:2112.55 E:0.112651 |  It is Peran with the ball at the back,
[1425.40 - 1427.40] P:2021.33 E:0.118758 |  long and right footed towards the edge of the box,
[1427.40 - 1430.40] P:1920.55 E:0.114882 |  that is headed away by Dari.
[1431.40 - 1434.40] P:1981.76 E:0.117750 |  And then again the French with Fafana,
[1434.40 - 1437.40] P:1894.10 E:0.106080 |  but bollied onto the chest of Hakini
[1437.40 - 1440.40] P:1653.07 E:0.109189 |  and Morocco having it again in front of their penalty area.
[1440.40 - 1443.40] P:1724.25 E:0.119581 |  Even though it's one-nil, I'm tempted to say,
[1443.40 - 1447.40] P:1690.45 E:0.103893 |  if we've got a Morocco-Argentina final on Sunday,
[1447.40 - 1451.40] P:1738.80 E:0.108958 |  well, the next hour and a bit are going to be worth watching.
[1451.40 - 1454.40] P:1872.59 E:0.121881 |  France concede a free kick,
[1454.40 - 1457.40] P:1959.87 E:0.117570 |  and Bernate just stepped in, just a little heavy free kick
[1457.40 - 1460.40] P:1909.77 E:0.116002 |  against Hakini, so against the Ash,
[1460.40 - 1462.40] P:1680.38 E:0.109107 |  a free kick near the half-way line.
[1462.40 - 1465.40] P:1529.56 E:0.106929 |  Referee just comes across and has a word with Canate.
[1465.40 - 1468.40] P:1668.35 E:0.117102 |  Just first impression, no, it's not a yellow card.
[1468.40 - 1473.40] P:1740.19 E:0.118999 |  One more away, I just wondered whether that was an over-Zellas challenge.
[1473.40 - 1477.40] P:1720.46 E:0.112406 |  It's had a pretty solid start, Canate.
[1478.40 - 1481.40] P:1697.05 E:0.118193 |  It was just discussing before the centre-back pair
[1481.40 - 1485.40] P:1735.44 E:0.113728 |  in which started the game, which they even lost to Tunisia.
[1485.40 - 1489.40] P:1660.70 E:0.109122 |  Tunisia, the great match, the one they could afford to lose and did.
[1489.40 - 1493.40] P:1662.81 E:0.103165 |  And this is his third start of the tournament, Canate.
[1493.40 - 1498.40] P:1599.29 E:0.100435 |  As I said, barely played, just four appearances for Liverpool this season.
[1499.40 - 1502.40] P:1615.36 E:0.104563 |  Morocco take a throw back towards the half-way line,
[1502.40 - 1505.40] P:1703.92 E:0.092979 |  where El Yameek, we're knocking across to Darry,
[1505.40 - 1510.40] P:1509.84 E:0.098394 |  and then El Yameek again in the two centre defenders together.
[1510.40 - 1514.40] P:1618.02 E:0.110126 |  In fact, Amrabat has dropped right back there, almost into the back line.
[1514.40 - 1517.40] P:1701.48 E:0.109161 |  Amrabat turning it, here to the left-hand side.
[1517.40 - 1522.40] P:1699.88 E:0.112157 |  And then both played in-field by Unahi.
[1522.40 - 1527.40] P:1759.52 E:0.110080 |  And now Amrabat, then central, Amal-A, will see the run of Hakimi.
[1527.40 - 1530.40] P:1759.76 E:0.112856 |  And Hakimi tries the shot, but that's into the back of Canate,
[1530.40 - 1535.40] P:2007.53 E:0.115604 |  and it bounces away, the broad back, the centre defender.
[1535.40 - 1538.40] P:1949.33 E:0.120695 |  And now it is the French coming forward with them back there,
[1538.40 - 1540.40] P:1901.08 E:0.116171 |  but that comes to nothing.
[1540.40 - 1544.40] P:1996.82 E:0.111414 |  But there is an infringement in centre-field by...
[1548.40 - 1550.40] P:1944.69 E:0.121623 |  Dembele.
[1550.40 - 1555.40] P:1912.50 E:0.105184 |  He should see yellow for that, as far as I'm concerned.
[1555.40 - 1559.40] P:1803.60 E:0.105187 |  And Ahi gets the ball, drops his shoulder, gets the other side of him,
[1559.40 - 1563.40] P:1611.70 E:0.095321 |  and a lot of country dancing there from Dembele,
[1563.40 - 1565.40] P:1693.63 E:0.093505 |  hauling him back.
[1565.40 - 1568.40] P:1720.05 E:0.106282 |  Very generous, the referee.
[1568.40 - 1572.40] P:1747.58 E:0.116870 |  Morocco with Hakimi, back out to the right side again.
[1572.40 - 1575.40] P:1719.39 E:0.118023 |  Ziaz gets his head down now, putting in field,
[1575.40 - 1578.40] P:1713.72 E:0.117844 |  and then, oh, challenge inside the penalty area,
[1578.40 - 1582.40] P:1895.66 E:0.106595 |  that's given us a free-kick for Foul on tail Hernandez.
[1582.40 - 1587.40] P:1973.67 E:0.117661 |  I did think for a moment, and it's a yellow card, actually, as well.
[1587.40 - 1593.40] P:2031.13 E:0.108441 |  Yellow card for Sofyan Boufal, the referee.
[1593.40 - 1597.40] P:1981.26 E:0.107100 |  Well, hang on a minute.
[1597.40 - 1599.40] P:1880.79 E:0.105725 |  We're just watching the replay here.
[1599.40 - 1602.40] P:1604.86 E:0.096518 |  Now, that's given us a yellow card against the Moroccan player, Boufal.
[1602.40 - 1607.40] P:1641.44 E:0.102001 |  It actually looks like it was a foul from Hernandez on Boufal,
[1607.40 - 1611.40] P:1590.63 E:0.096140 |  unless we're missing something which happened earlier in the move.
[1611.40 - 1614.40] P:1663.60 E:0.093373 |  Well, that's what it looked like to me when we saw it again.
[1614.40 - 1617.40] P:1596.19 E:0.085283 |  But surely it had to be for that incident.
[1617.40 - 1620.40] P:1722.75 E:0.103487 |  Now, Hernandez has come off worst in this.
[1620.40 - 1622.40] P:1760.12 E:0.106999 |  He put the challenge in.
[1622.40 - 1626.40] P:1815.51 E:0.108023 |  It was kind of a 50-50, but they were both late, effectively.
[1626.40 - 1631.40] P:1723.89 E:0.106681 |  It seemed like Hernandez didn't get any of the ball there.
[1631.40 - 1635.40] P:1733.85 E:0.104385 |  He was fiddled by that one, because if he did bring Boufal down,
[1635.40 - 1639.40] P:1784.45 E:0.102142 |  it should be a penalty to Morocco.
[1639.40 - 1641.40] P:1744.83 E:0.097854 |  So while Hernandez is receiving treatment,
[1641.40 - 1643.40] P:1712.13 E:0.095285 |  play has not resumed yet.
[1643.40 - 1646.40] P:1564.87 E:0.087818 |  Moroccan players are coming for a drink,
[1646.40 - 1648.40] P:1555.29 E:0.099588 |  as has often been the case at this World Cup,
[1648.40 - 1651.40] P:1626.54 E:0.101746 |  just when you want to see another couple of replays of the penalty incident,
[1651.40 - 1654.40] P:1761.44 E:0.104461 |  they're actually showing us pictures of the crowd celebrating the goal
[1654.40 - 1656.40] P:1783.28 E:0.106169 |  after five minutes of the match.
[1656.40 - 1660.40] P:1774.86 E:0.094954 |  So we'll just have to go with what we've seen now, because...
[1660.40 - 1665.40] P:1738.27 E:0.103699 |  I don't know whether that could be for something which happened a few seconds earlier,
[1665.40 - 1671.40] P:1538.76 E:0.091968 |  but that's really baffling, that decision.
[1671.40 - 1678.40] P:1610.82 E:0.101396 |  It seemed like Hernandez, the goal scorer, who was the offender there.
[1678.40 - 1682.40] P:1623.38 E:0.106656 |  Well, he's okay. He's received treatment.
[1682.40 - 1685.40] P:1609.63 E:0.111278 |  And he's flexing his right leg.
[1685.40 - 1687.40] P:1539.48 E:0.118369 |  Play has not resumed yet.
[1687.40 - 1689.40] P:1535.41 E:0.096589 |  They're still enjoying their drinks break.
[1689.40 - 1694.40] P:1549.60 E:0.103488 |  And I think that as well, while Eid regraggy has taken the opportunity there
[1694.40 - 1698.40] P:1666.15 E:0.104779 |  to give them a bit of a G up, actually, the position that they're in, you know,
[1698.40 - 1701.40] P:1841.55 E:0.107755 |  we can see it from up here. They'll know it down there.
[1701.40 - 1703.40] P:1946.21 E:0.115043 |  They're right up against it here.
[1703.40 - 1708.40] P:2034.08 E:0.119908 |  And Play resumed with a French free kick inside their penalty area.
[1708.40 - 1712.40] P:2055.80 E:0.116643 |  Goodness knows whether we'll ever get to see that again.
[1712.40 - 1716.40] P:2023.62 E:0.119096 |  And as I'd have guessed, we will see it again, but...
[1716.40 - 1719.40] P:1981.88 E:0.119894 |  Look like a penalty to Morocco to me.
[1719.40 - 1722.40] P:1797.77 E:0.114060 |  They're not working.
[1722.40 - 1725.40] P:1693.33 E:0.117093 |  It is Morocco who are back in possession.
[1725.40 - 1729.40] P:1833.80 E:0.116559 |  But Shiru arrives on the scene and wins it back from Amravat.
[1729.40 - 1735.40] P:1886.02 E:0.116325 |  And now Shiru is bundled over, bowled over by Amala,
[1735.40 - 1740.40] P:1760.78 E:0.103157 |  who just comes in, uses his body and sends Shiru sprawling across the turf.
[1740.40 - 1744.40] P:1739.24 E:0.106667 |  The free kick count in this match is high.
[1744.40 - 1747.40] P:1729.43 E:0.106054 |  And it's a free kick for France that we're going to see now.
[1747.40 - 1750.40] P:1752.07 E:0.112480 |  Shiru just getting the other side of Amala.
[1750.40 - 1755.40] P:1762.89 E:0.114158 |  Amala bundling him over and Shiru having words.
[1755.40 - 1758.40] P:1780.79 E:0.109223 |  Seeing them back, they play different roles.
[1758.40 - 1761.40] P:1915.70 E:0.114732 |  It's what I've seen him play earlier on in the tournament
[1761.40 - 1768.40] P:2021.10 E:0.109869 |  where he's not just hanging really wide on that left-hand touch line he's playing.
[1768.40 - 1771.40] P:2092.76 E:0.117178 |  There's an inside forward,
[1771.40 - 1775.40] P:2106.30 E:0.114855 |  and the inside at the Kimi,
[1775.40 - 1778.40] P:2074.69 E:0.112232 |  quite close to Shiru.
[1778.40 - 1780.40] P:2032.72 E:0.120901 |  Half an hour played, France won, Morocco nil.
[1780.40 - 1783.40] P:1993.43 E:0.106832 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[1783.40 - 1787.40] P:1820.90 E:0.115328 |  Well, BBC Sounds as well, of course, and across Africa on the World Service.
[1787.40 - 1790.40] P:1748.15 E:0.117626 |  He has Amala, the substitute.
[1790.40 - 1793.40] P:1823.13 E:0.113707 |  Nice turn, plays it centrally.
[1793.40 - 1795.40] P:1839.00 E:0.109818 |  And...
[1795.40 - 1798.40] P:1656.00 E:0.116544 |  Unahi is onto the extended play to Zeehash on the right-hand side.
[1798.40 - 1801.40] P:1735.04 E:0.110488 |  Zeehash on his left foot, lots of French shirts back,
[1801.40 - 1803.40] P:1690.55 E:0.108963 |  so he uses Masrawi,
[1803.40 - 1806.40] P:1642.15 E:0.118667 |  and then Manjrawi to the left-hand side.
[1806.40 - 1809.40] P:1719.99 E:0.119421 |  Dufal slips it into the penalty area.
[1809.40 - 1812.40] P:1762.79 E:0.111326 |  Masrawi drags it back outside the D,
[1812.40 - 1816.40] P:1690.54 E:0.110231 |  but the offside flag is up against the diameter of Manjrawi.
[1816.40 - 1820.40] P:1649.43 E:0.114610 |  And even though Unahi goes for goal,
[1820.40 - 1823.40] P:1764.95 E:0.114086 |  he killed a shot going wide, goal-kicked, free kick.
[1823.40 - 1826.40] P:1835.42 E:0.116726 |  They work the ball from right to left.
[1826.40 - 1829.40] P:1808.79 E:0.114626 |  They just wondered whether Zeehash had the opportunity
[1829.40 - 1832.40] P:1808.70 E:0.112904 |  to get an early crossing.
[1832.40 - 1835.40] P:1742.03 E:0.115143 |  Morocco had loaded the box, came out to the left-hand side,
[1835.40 - 1837.40] P:1792.14 E:0.115351 |  and a poor run for it.
[1837.40 - 1840.40] P:1856.92 E:0.117021 |  That's Raoui, the left-back from Morocco.
[1840.40 - 1842.40] P:1846.07 E:0.119545 |  Three or four yards offside,
[1842.40 - 1845.40] P:1909.73 E:0.116284 |  and Mufal fed into ball.
[1845.40 - 1848.40] P:1980.63 E:0.116163 |  There's only been that one effort, that long-range effort,
[1848.40 - 1852.40] P:2038.51 E:0.115340 |  which will resave comfortably from Morocco.
[1852.40 - 1855.40] P:2082.01 E:0.113313 |  But I think we'll both be really interested to see
[1855.40 - 1858.40] P:1955.49 E:0.107029 |  whether we get to see that challenge again,
[1858.40 - 1860.40] P:1815.03 E:0.097849 |  for which Dufal was booked, trust me.
[1860.40 - 1863.40] P:1851.45 E:0.110814 |  Dufal was booked for that challenge on Hernandez.
[1863.40 - 1867.40] P:1737.44 E:0.118200 |  With the one replay we saw, it looked more like it fell by Hernandez
[1867.40 - 1871.40] P:1643.18 E:0.113201 |  on Dufal inside the French penalty area.
[1871.40 - 1873.40] P:1802.51 E:0.120060 |  Now, Amala plays it through the middle,
[1873.40 - 1875.40] P:1682.41 E:0.120070 |  and the series was almost onto that,
[1875.40 - 1878.40] P:1925.32 E:0.111147 |  but defenders went with him, good defending, actually.
[1878.40 - 1881.40] P:1975.00 E:0.109716 |  Brown and Canate together,
[1881.40 - 1883.40] P:1744.19 E:0.111666 |  and then they can't keep the ball in on the far side,
[1883.40 - 1885.40] P:1694.11 E:0.116323 |  and it's a throw-in through the clinch.
[1885.40 - 1887.40] P:1784.83 E:0.121734 |  It was really good defending.
[1887.40 - 1891.40] P:1874.70 E:0.105285 |  Anahi has got in behind the French midfield,
[1891.40 - 1893.40] P:1934.00 E:0.111065 |  once or twice now,
[1893.40 - 1896.40] P:1962.46 E:0.120126 |  and slipped the ball from the central area to Niziri.
[1896.40 - 1898.40] P:1898.11 E:0.111828 |  They've made a good run on the inside of Brown,
[1898.40 - 1901.40] P:1922.06 E:0.118109 |  but Canate, his big right boot.
[1901.40 - 1905.40] P:1838.75 E:0.119745 |  Just making sure he stuck that out,
[1905.40 - 1908.40] P:1622.81 E:0.114267 |  and made the interception.
[1908.40 - 1911.40] P:1588.01 E:0.119473 |  So half an hour play, that's Chris Sutton with us.
[1911.40 - 1913.40] P:1510.63 E:0.113399 |  Michael Richards is here as well.
[1913.40 - 1915.40] P:1528.09 E:0.101633 |  We're here from Michael at half-time, Mark Chapman,
[1915.40 - 1918.40] P:1545.75 E:0.112399 |  up in the commentary position, high in the stadium,
[1918.40 - 1920.40] P:1510.84 E:0.105299 |  on the dressing room side of the ground.
[1920.40 - 1922.40] P:1522.60 E:0.104849 |  And France, just the one goal in it,
[1922.40 - 1924.40] P:1563.36 E:0.103977 |  but France, it does feel in control,
[1924.40 - 1926.40] P:1522.31 E:0.112492 |  and Morocco had to deal with things tonight
[1926.40 - 1929.40] P:1559.19 E:0.105255 |  that they've not had to deal with during the course of this world cup.
[1929.40 - 1933.40] P:1610.96 E:0.095719 |  And I'm talking in terms of going behind in the match,
[1933.40 - 1936.40] P:1802.56 E:0.113612 |  one nail down, but also the injuries and the disruption.
[1936.40 - 1938.40] P:1964.08 E:0.120284 |  And it's the French who come forward again,
[1938.40 - 1941.40] P:2048.94 E:0.116747 |  and that was a late challenge, actually, but play continues.
[1941.40 - 1943.40] P:2048.98 E:0.118443 |  And then back into the final of the area on the left-hand side,
[1943.40 - 1946.40] P:1913.58 E:0.118611 |  lays it back to the edge of the box, low shot from Tronnainy,
[1946.40 - 1949.40] P:1740.14 E:0.107942 |  but Giroud is in an offside position,
[1949.40 - 1951.40] P:1675.44 E:0.112207 |  and it is a free kick to Morocco.
[1951.40 - 1953.40] P:1678.18 E:0.099457 |  And Hernandez has taken another knock there,
[1953.40 - 1955.40] P:1611.83 E:0.104893 |  and that was late on him this time.
[1955.40 - 1958.40] P:1745.24 E:0.103923 |  He managed to play the ball forward, but was caught late.
[1958.40 - 1961.40] P:1953.75 E:0.110894 |  I think we'll see a yellow guard here, will we?
[1961.40 - 1962.40] P:1961.58 E:0.109651 |  No.
[1962.40 - 1964.40] P:1961.94 E:0.110093 |  Well, it should have been.
[1966.40 - 1968.40] P:1681.42 E:0.117732 |  Oh, yeah, I mean, that's...
[1968.40 - 1972.40] P:1628.59 E:0.112566 |  If you don't get booked for that, it was really poor challenge.
[1972.40 - 1976.40] P:1592.60 E:0.115456 |  Very, very late from Dari, I think it was,
[1976.40 - 1978.40] P:1677.79 E:0.118122 |  as it was on Hernandez.
[1978.40 - 1982.40] P:1648.62 E:0.111029 |  He popped the ball out left to a back-eight,
[1982.40 - 1985.40] P:1640.00 E:0.114846 |  drove the inside in the back-eight,
[1985.40 - 1987.40] P:1658.26 E:0.111945 |  and he's such a threat, such a danger,
[1987.40 - 1989.40] P:1517.14 E:0.116738 |  when he's running at defenders with pace.
[1989.40 - 1992.40] P:1700.80 E:0.112323 |  He's quite fortunate to get away with that.
[1992.40 - 1996.40] P:1939.97 E:0.106625 |  In terms of physically, Hernandez, that could have been nasty.
[1996.40 - 1998.40] P:2055.15 E:0.118301 |  But he's with a bit of force, actually.
[1998.40 - 2000.40] P:2078.88 E:0.112953 |  Here's Giroud, here's Griezmann,
[2000.40 - 2002.40] P:2073.22 E:0.118932 |  taking the ball on down the right-hand side.
[2002.40 - 2005.40] P:1941.62 E:0.110090 |  Dempalli with a cross, it comes off to Dronnainy,
[2005.40 - 2007.40] P:1756.87 E:0.106704 |  who could not get there and clear it away
[2007.40 - 2009.40] P:1824.27 E:0.111368 |  before he did cross the white line.
[2009.40 - 2013.40] P:1773.33 E:0.097175 |  So it is a corner to the French from the right.
[2013.40 - 2015.40] P:1955.14 E:0.111606 |  So it's corner of the match, I think.
[2015.40 - 2017.40] P:1981.06 E:0.113040 |  Yes, it is.
[2018.40 - 2023.40] P:2031.23 E:0.120259 |  Dempalli likes to come inside on his left foot this time,
[2023.40 - 2026.40] P:2059.60 E:0.119043 |  driving the outside, low cross, which,
[2026.40 - 2030.40] P:2032.84 E:0.115495 |  Matt Rowey reflected off him, goes behind.
[2030.40 - 2033.40] P:2072.00 E:0.116442 |  It's the first match that you and I have commentated on,
[2033.40 - 2035.40] P:2041.10 E:0.113416 |  Morocco inside the stadium,
[2035.40 - 2039.40] P:2032.79 E:0.117023 |  and the whistling is quite thrill, isn't it?
[2041.40 - 2044.40] P:2024.11 E:0.120334 |  Griezmann to take this corner.
[2044.40 - 2046.40] P:2061.98 E:0.120253 |  Lots of movement in the box.
[2046.40 - 2048.40] P:1954.43 E:0.119096 |  Griezmann plays it in, takes a little glance,
[2048.40 - 2052.40] P:1673.92 E:0.113109 |  and then the shot on the turn, off balance for Farner, actually.
[2052.40 - 2055.40] P:1552.55 E:0.111686 |  He's having a twist and hit it, and as he hits it on the half-volley.
[2055.40 - 2058.40] P:1655.21 E:0.109777 |  Hit it white and high, and Waelnk, goal kick.
[2058.40 - 2062.40] P:1729.27 E:0.111040 |  Yeah, had more time there, for Farner, did.
[2062.40 - 2065.40] P:1613.45 E:0.116783 |  Had to run across the near post, and the ball breaks behind him,
[2065.40 - 2069.40] P:1642.97 E:0.108380 |  so he's running back towards his own goal, as the ball bounces,
[2069.40 - 2075.40] P:1682.17 E:0.107682 |  but lashed the left-footed shot wildly over Bono's bar.
[2077.40 - 2081.40] P:1547.80 E:0.114227 |  So the goal kick is taken, and actually the goalkeeper,
[2081.40 - 2090.40] P:1609.57 E:0.116190 |  all in blue tonight, is walking out of the penalty area with the ball.
[2090.40 - 2094.40] P:1650.12 E:0.118528 |  I think producer Gary has found a replay of the incident
[2094.40 - 2097.40] P:1561.44 E:0.111233 |  that we think Morocco might have had a case for a penalty.
[2097.40 - 2100.40] P:1536.59 E:0.109072 |  So just keep an eye on that, Trace, while I commentate,
[2100.40 - 2104.40] P:1497.27 E:0.096930 |  and see what you think, as Morocco bring it forward,
[2104.40 - 2108.40] P:1961.93 E:0.115964 |  but Truimeni steps in, and now Truimeni carries the ball forward.
[2108.40 - 2111.40] P:2007.92 E:0.116720 |  Excellent balance for him, kept his feet, gives it to him, Bappé!
[2111.40 - 2114.40] P:1780.75 E:0.114029 |  Bappé plays it across the edge of the six-yard box,
[2114.40 - 2117.40] P:1794.95 E:0.115013 |  and it was cleared away by a falling El Yameek,
[2117.40 - 2122.40] P:1672.20 E:0.102532 |  and then it's driven in from what, 25 yards from Truimeni,
[2122.40 - 2124.40] P:1505.96 E:0.105149 |  who landed onto it, but that was Waelnk.
[2124.40 - 2128.40] P:1639.29 E:0.108027 |  It came to Truimeni, the shot from Truimeni,
[2128.40 - 2131.40] P:1557.17 E:0.090970 |  and I think Tru has to score that.
[2131.40 - 2135.40] P:1700.33 E:0.104422 |  That's a huge opportunity initially, and Bappé puts the burners on,
[2135.40 - 2139.40] P:1687.25 E:0.098635 |  gets on the inside of Hakimi, Bono comes out,
[2139.40 - 2142.40] P:1875.07 E:0.094235 |  and as the ball is struck towards goal,
[2142.40 - 2146.40] P:1762.68 E:0.102279 |  Giroud loitering around the penalty spot, hooks the shot,
[2146.40 - 2152.40] P:1689.58 E:0.092061 |  goal-wards, but you'd expect a player of his quality,
[2152.40 - 2156.40] P:1611.19 E:0.096148 |  and it's been so impressive in this tournament to hit the back of the net.
[2156.40 - 2161.40] P:1581.13 E:0.104665 |  He sweeps the ball past the right-hand post from Bono.
[2161.40 - 2166.40] P:1605.31 E:0.098030 |  Had time to take the ball in then, take a touch and finish.
[2166.40 - 2169.40] P:1708.01 E:0.105470 |  Oh, Bono could be in trouble here for Driesman,
[2169.40 - 2172.40] P:1664.45 E:0.103196 |  who was able to drag it onto his left foot and clear it away.
[2172.40 - 2175.40] P:1728.87 E:0.112370 |  That's another chance Giroud then, he's hit the post,
[2175.40 - 2177.40] P:1656.31 E:0.108614 |  he's had that opportunity put wide,
[2177.40 - 2179.40] P:1678.28 E:0.106208 |  and then they scored the early goal.
[2179.40 - 2182.40] P:1866.71 E:0.105712 |  This looks ominous, Chris, I must say, for Morocco.
[2182.40 - 2184.40] P:1872.63 E:0.117373 |  Well, it does, but you've got to ask the question,
[2184.40 - 2190.40] P:1889.26 E:0.105684 |  will the French brew those missed opportunities?
[2190.40 - 2193.40] P:1752.59 E:0.108706 |  And now Tremaine has been fouled by Amrabat.
[2193.40 - 2197.40] P:1699.03 E:0.103022 |  I mean, we've seen some crazy refereeing in this World Cup.
[2197.40 - 2200.40] P:1673.02 E:0.103536 |  We've seen referees card happy.
[2200.40 - 2202.40] P:1699.69 E:0.109953 |  I was at the Netherlands Argentina game,
[2202.40 - 2205.40] P:1698.24 E:0.102134 |  where, I mean, there was a seven-tug,
[2205.40 - 2208.40] P:1696.51 E:0.107117 |  we lost, Karen, we gave up myself and Ian Dennis after a while,
[2208.40 - 2213.40] P:1742.00 E:0.111960 |  and this one just keeping his cards close to his chest.
[2213.40 - 2215.40] P:1782.71 E:0.115239 |  I think it was more than that, wasn't it?
[2215.40 - 2220.40] P:2000.91 E:0.117371 |  This is the referee who's shown only seven yellow cards
[2220.40 - 2223.40] P:2046.23 E:0.122903 |  in the three matches that he's refereed before today.
[2223.40 - 2226.40] P:2064.52 E:0.120701 |  So he is one who does keep his cards close to his chest.
[2226.40 - 2227.40] P:2109.13 E:0.121292 |  Where is he from?
[2227.40 - 2229.40] P:2104.79 E:0.112493 |  Just Mexico.
[2229.40 - 2234.40] P:2017.55 E:0.118081 |  Mexican League, must have had a lot of rough and tumble.
[2234.40 - 2238.40] P:2064.08 E:0.113504 |  Well, I wouldn't want to stereotype Chris,
[2238.40 - 2242.40] P:2012.48 E:0.119599 |  but I met some Mexicans on the Metro last night
[2242.40 - 2244.40] P:1990.84 E:0.117958 |  when I was coming back from the sale.
[2244.40 - 2247.40] P:2002.08 E:0.121026 |  Yes, he said you must come to the Azteca in four years time.
[2247.40 - 2250.40] P:2027.23 E:0.117870 |  Yeah, he had a little drip to Nando's as well, I heard.
[2250.40 - 2253.40] P:2020.15 E:0.114170 |  That was the theme of the night.
[2255.40 - 2258.40] P:2059.78 E:0.118486 |  France won Morocco nil.
[2258.40 - 2261.40] P:2044.43 E:0.116646 |  Did you see the replay of the Moroccan championship?
[2261.40 - 2265.40] P:1882.53 E:0.107676 |  I may be going mad, but I thought it was a penalty to Morocco.
[2265.40 - 2267.40] P:2018.42 E:0.118257 |  Tremaine bringing it forward,
[2267.40 - 2269.40] P:1991.22 E:0.121720 |  but then gives it back to Fafano,
[2269.40 - 2272.40] P:2024.66 E:0.121725 |  who will go back to Canate inside his own heart.
[2272.40 - 2274.40] P:2047.82 E:0.117176 |  But what's about VAR?
[2274.40 - 2277.40] P:1987.72 E:0.118949 |  Why is VAR not dealing with that?
[2277.40 - 2279.40] P:2018.00 E:0.116205 |  They must have had a look at it.
[2279.40 - 2281.40] P:2067.16 E:0.111099 |  They decided it wasn't.
[2281.40 - 2283.40] P:2048.82 E:0.113547 |  That was battling.
[2283.40 - 2285.40] P:2109.69 E:0.119805 |  It really was.
[2286.40 - 2289.40] P:1992.30 E:0.120819 |  The VAR tonight, as the balls played over the top
[2289.40 - 2294.40] P:1898.92 E:0.109472 |  for France, looking for Mbappe,
[2294.40 - 2296.40] P:1804.62 E:0.118252 |  but this time they're able to deal with it.
[2296.40 - 2298.40] P:1841.96 E:0.102048 |  Morocco advances back into central defence,
[2298.40 - 2299.40] P:1777.65 E:0.109672 |  but the penalty...
[2299.40 - 2301.40] P:1671.14 E:0.109607 |  Well, I suppose if it's a Mexican VAR,
[2301.40 - 2304.40] P:1673.20 E:0.105845 |  I would have thrown a stereo type to Mexican League.
[2304.40 - 2307.40] P:1546.16 E:0.109380 |  You could see why they would let that go, but I mean, climbing.
[2307.40 - 2310.40] P:1901.73 E:0.120168 |  It's not. It's Canadian. Drew Fisher.
[2310.40 - 2313.40] P:2061.45 E:0.115756 |  Here's Mbappe on the left-hand side,
[2313.40 - 2316.40] P:2055.40 E:0.118828 |  gives it in towards Griezmann, 30 yards out.
[2316.40 - 2319.40] P:2078.08 E:0.120211 |  Mbappe goes behind him to Fafano,
[2319.40 - 2321.40] P:2055.43 E:0.119156 |  now on the right-hand side,
[2321.40 - 2323.40] P:1994.55 E:0.121176 |  support by Den Belly.
[2323.40 - 2326.40] P:1878.29 E:0.117856 |  Griezmann in the box now, and then a crucial challenge.
[2326.40 - 2329.40] P:1767.14 E:0.112119 |  He went to the ground, slid in.
[2329.40 - 2332.40] P:1791.31 E:0.099994 |  He had to get that right, Eliamic, but he did corner.
[2332.40 - 2336.40] P:1794.53 E:0.109714 |  Similar to the position which Griezmann took up
[2336.40 - 2339.40] P:1833.75 E:0.109150 |  when the French scored their first goal.
[2339.40 - 2342.40] P:1848.48 E:0.111412 |  That right-hand channel just making the run beyond,
[2342.40 - 2345.40] P:1910.81 E:0.115421 |  but it only makes some credit.
[2345.40 - 2347.40] P:1942.09 E:0.122419 |  Gets back and makes the challenge,
[2347.40 - 2350.40] P:1959.82 E:0.115839 |  and Griezmann was bearing down on goal.
[2350.40 - 2353.40] P:2029.44 E:0.118194 |  So, Griezmann with the corner,
[2353.40 - 2356.40] P:2031.41 E:0.125403 |  the referee is talking to Canate,
[2356.40 - 2359.40] P:2001.33 E:0.118043 |  and Eliamic, who are standing next to the penalty spot.
[2359.40 - 2362.40] P:2029.33 E:0.120667 |  So, we've got two French players here, the penalty spot,
[2362.40 - 2364.40] P:2029.83 E:0.113412 |  actually three now,
[2364.40 - 2367.40] P:2006.14 E:0.122076 |  and Griezmann waiting to whip this in. Left footed.
[2367.40 - 2370.40] P:2036.78 E:0.115594 |  Here's the corner, and it's all flick-white at the near post.
[2370.40 - 2372.40] P:2076.61 E:0.123059 |  The run there was a good one from Ferran,
[2372.40 - 2374.40] P:2032.63 E:0.120881 |  actually just tried to help it out,
[2374.40 - 2376.40] P:1912.57 E:0.105813 |  but it's not a good one.
[2376.40 - 2379.40] P:1616.27 E:0.106895 |  That's twice. Corners from Griezmann,
[2379.40 - 2382.40] P:1663.62 E:0.103989 |  whipped in, left footed, in swingers.
[2382.40 - 2386.40] P:1637.55 E:0.106398 |  And there's Fafana with the previous corner.
[2386.40 - 2390.40] P:1710.44 E:0.108717 |  Made the run, first man into that near post space.
[2390.40 - 2393.40] P:1736.79 E:0.108785 |  I think it's Masrari, who's supposed to be occupying that area for Morocco,
[2393.40 - 2395.40] P:1559.46 E:0.095360 |  but once again, switching off,
[2395.40 - 2397.40] P:1515.87 E:0.107193 |  Ferran making the run across him,
[2397.40 - 2399.40] P:1548.02 E:0.102260 |  just couldn't deflect the ball.
[2399.40 - 2401.40] P:1480.68 E:0.108859 |  And he's not going to be able to do that,
[2401.40 - 2403.40] P:1509.94 E:0.099882 |  but he's going to be able to do that.
[2403.40 - 2406.40] P:1503.16 E:0.100347 |  And then, Ferran making the run across him,
[2406.40 - 2409.40] P:1502.94 E:0.109264 |  just couldn't deflect the ball on target.
[2409.40 - 2412.40] P:1504.31 E:0.108385 |  So, it's still just one-nil.
[2412.40 - 2414.40] P:1563.95 E:0.109273 |  So, they might rue these chances.
[2414.40 - 2417.40] P:1617.20 E:0.107744 |  There could be streets ahead.
[2417.40 - 2421.40] P:1529.41 E:0.106218 |  Morocco bringing the ball towards the halfway line.
[2421.40 - 2424.40] P:1465.63 E:0.103993 |  And it's turned here to the left-hand side for Amala.
[2424.40 - 2427.40] P:1572.34 E:0.109034 |  Amala shuffling forward with the ball,
[2427.40 - 2429.40] P:1749.86 E:0.101249 |  but over hits the pass.
[2429.40 - 2432.40] P:1719.50 E:0.104139 |  And France have got it back inside their own penalty area.
[2432.40 - 2434.40] P:1877.69 E:0.110699 |  And it's a minute to go to the break.
[2434.40 - 2436.40] P:2061.87 E:0.103739 |  France won Morocco, nil.
[2436.40 - 2439.40] P:1998.50 E:0.106162 |  This time next week, incidentally,
[2439.40 - 2441.40] P:2001.67 E:0.114204 |  if you're listening to Five Live,
[2441.40 - 2444.40] P:1966.30 E:0.104020 |  you'll be listening to Carabao Cup commentary.
[2444.40 - 2446.40] P:1920.05 E:0.108226 |  Manchester United against Burnley.
[2446.40 - 2450.40] P:1928.98 E:0.104889 |  It'll be the second of three nights of Carabao Cup commentary.
[2450.40 - 2454.40] P:1958.31 E:0.106510 |  I can't... It just seems surreal that to me.
[2454.40 - 2455.40] P:1942.98 E:0.111531 |  But...
[2455.40 - 2457.40] P:2008.99 E:0.114640 |  Manchester United against Burnley.
[2457.40 - 2460.40] P:2053.59 E:0.112634 |  Well, stepping from World Cup semi-final
[2460.40 - 2463.40] P:2066.76 E:0.110716 |  to Wednesday night to League Cup fourth round,
[2463.40 - 2465.40] P:2057.71 E:0.115270 |  the next Wednesday night.
[2465.40 - 2468.40] P:2147.70 E:0.115028 |  But I'm sure there's many people who've been drawn into Five Live
[2468.40 - 2472.40] P:2139.12 E:0.114682 |  because of the World Cup over the course of the last few weeks or so.
[2472.40 - 2476.40] P:2073.33 E:0.115050 |  And if you have, or if you're new to our football coverage,
[2476.40 - 2478.40] P:2024.76 E:0.109414 |  as the ball's played over the top for Dempale,
[2478.40 - 2480.40] P:1934.73 E:0.096821 |  but I don't think you'll reach that.
[2480.40 - 2482.40] P:1769.91 E:0.101470 |  And it bounces through for a gold kick.
[2482.40 - 2484.40] P:1643.67 E:0.102940 |  This is what we do all the time, isn't it, Chris?
[2484.40 - 2488.40] P:1537.26 E:0.105686 |  For new listeners, this is what you can listen to on Five Live all the time.
[2488.40 - 2490.40] P:1725.60 E:0.101031 |  Football commentary, live sports commentary.
[2490.40 - 2492.40] P:1686.00 E:0.113948 |  Premier League FA Cup,
[2492.40 - 2494.40] P:1693.73 E:0.101044 |  next first weekend in January.
[2494.40 - 2496.40] P:1649.24 E:0.105977 |  We'll be bringing you the FA Cup,
[2496.40 - 2499.40] P:1702.10 E:0.098536 |  that'll be all over Five Live and the BBC,
[2499.40 - 2502.40] P:1588.75 E:0.096836 |  and then the Champions League in February and March.
[2502.40 - 2506.40] P:1501.92 E:0.098414 |  It's all here for you on BBC Radio Five Live.
[2506.40 - 2509.40] P:1592.68 E:0.110988 |  Right now you can take the World Cup with you, John.
[2509.40 - 2512.40] P:1536.81 E:0.099630 |  You can still take the World Cup with you.
[2512.40 - 2515.40] P:1570.89 E:0.100117 |  But time's running out, so take it.
[2515.40 - 2520.40] P:1721.67 E:0.106886 |  That's Rowey. Long ball forward, but that is over the head of N-Missyari.
[2520.40 - 2525.40] P:1916.41 E:0.111674 |  We've just not really seen as a factor in this match so far in N-Missyari.
[2525.40 - 2530.40] P:2040.40 E:0.112018 |  No, and I think it's, you know, he's been starved of service,
[2530.40 - 2536.40] P:2136.67 E:0.109671 |  but when you saw his leap for the goal against Portugal,
[2536.40 - 2541.40] P:2118.20 E:0.113662 |  you're thinking, why not try and get a couple of crosses into the box for him?
[2541.40 - 2546.40] P:2080.58 E:0.108429 |  That's a couple of peaks into Hart and Canate and Hurran.
[2546.40 - 2551.40] P:2069.34 E:0.116201 |  Not many defenders could have lived with that N-Missyari jump.
[2551.40 - 2553.40] P:1995.93 E:0.110376 |  Was it nine-foot?
[2553.40 - 2556.40] P:1812.46 E:0.109342 |  It's that right. I missed that. Nine feet.
[2556.40 - 2559.40] P:1670.92 E:0.095057 |  I think he... 9'1", I think.
[2559.40 - 2561.40] P:1819.05 E:0.099012 |  It's like basketball.
[2561.40 - 2565.40] P:1839.48 E:0.104648 |  So they tell me, as the balls hooked forward by Tuneini,
[2565.40 - 2567.40] P:1598.66 E:0.102502 |  but it bounces for Masraoui.
[2567.40 - 2570.40] P:1606.15 E:0.110676 |  Masraoui could be in trouble here against Dempale,
[2570.40 - 2573.40] P:1517.85 E:0.096704 |  but he managed to get the ball down and get away from him
[2573.40 - 2576.40] P:1502.62 E:0.101697 |  and is able to take it away.
[2576.40 - 2581.40] P:1610.59 E:0.108748 |  And then, Amrabap swings one to the right-hand side
[2581.40 - 2584.40] P:1721.63 E:0.112613 |  and it comes in field for Onahi.
[2584.40 - 2587.40] P:1674.62 E:0.108201 |  And then into the penalty area, but a sliding interception.
[2587.40 - 2589.40] P:1737.99 E:0.103749 |  Good one as well from Canate.
[2589.40 - 2593.40] P:1691.35 E:0.116067 |  It's Hakimi, the right back with the run, the burst into the penalty area,
[2593.40 - 2595.40] P:1710.38 E:0.107250 |  but it's a Moroccan corner there first of the match.
[2595.40 - 2598.40] P:1675.15 E:0.108798 |  What do we know? We know that Mbappe doesn't track back.
[2598.40 - 2602.40] P:1766.62 E:0.107494 |  He's rolling down that right-hand side, giving go Canate.
[2602.40 - 2606.40] P:1774.89 E:0.103562 |  Got to say, it's been flawless in this first half of the French.
[2609.40 - 2612.40] P:1663.76 E:0.111533 |  Corner from the right. C.S. to take it, the referee
[2612.40 - 2615.40] P:1632.64 E:0.109188 |  that is right in the middle of things again, near the penalty spot.
[2615.40 - 2618.40] P:1639.26 E:0.106929 |  And there's lots of points in and knotting
[2618.40 - 2621.40] P:1586.15 E:0.110034 |  and instructions being given, and there's the whistle.
[2621.40 - 2624.40] P:1614.53 E:0.106003 |  So, half-time whistle, not far away.
[2624.40 - 2627.40] P:1572.97 E:0.103636 |  One-nil France lead. Could be more.
[2627.40 - 2630.40] P:1535.60 E:0.109904 |  But it is only just the one goal in it.
[2630.40 - 2634.40] P:1572.16 E:0.111743 |  C.S. with this corner into the near post, which is headed away by Varan,
[2634.40 - 2635.40] P:1703.67 E:0.117366 |  and then an overhead kick.
[2635.40 - 2639.40] P:1766.27 E:0.111046 |  It's the post! Bounces down, still in the side, the penalty area.
[2639.40 - 2641.40] P:1709.41 E:0.111797 |  I've got a feeling that was El Yameek,
[2641.40 - 2645.40] P:1727.00 E:0.110241 |  and then a shot on the edge of the D is stabbed wide.
[2645.40 - 2646.40] P:1691.24 E:0.121106 |  And what about that?
[2646.40 - 2649.40] P:1679.36 E:0.105504 |  A bicycle kick from the central defender
[2649.40 - 2653.40] P:1659.32 E:0.105111 |  that smacked the post to Loris' right and stayed out.
[2653.40 - 2656.40] P:1713.44 E:0.111809 |  Near the corner, fizzed in, Giroud.
[2658.40 - 2660.40] P:1766.66 E:0.110507 |  Just helps the ball on.
[2661.40 - 2667.40] P:1746.74 E:0.106248 |  It goes up in the air and El Yameek bicycle kick, as you say,
[2667.40 - 2669.40] P:1634.34 E:0.104962 |  and hammers the right-hand post.
[2669.40 - 2674.40] P:1789.73 E:0.108522 |  I think the referee just gets a tiny, tiny finger to the ball's crucial finger.
[2674.40 - 2676.40] P:1802.80 E:0.106110 |  Good save, huh?
[2676.40 - 2677.40] P:1847.15 E:0.123659 |  What's a good save?
[2677.40 - 2679.40] P:1756.12 E:0.113079 |  I mean, it might have been hitting the post anyway, but...
[2679.40 - 2681.40] P:1746.13 E:0.115903 |  Well, they get to it.
[2681.40 - 2686.40] P:1796.05 E:0.112738 |  They did, and I think El Yameek was the one who made the mistake.
[2686.40 - 2690.40] P:1746.35 E:0.099885 |  That poor error of judgement with a French goal.
[2691.40 - 2697.40] P:1547.30 E:0.114801 |  That's his tall, this lean, he's got a magnificent side parting in his hair.
[2697.40 - 2702.40] P:1603.00 E:0.111246 |  And he was so close there, coming up with the equaliser,
[2702.40 - 2704.40] P:1600.02 E:0.101970 |  that would have been a surprise.
[2704.40 - 2708.40] P:1700.14 E:0.107740 |  One-mill, translate, and there goes Morocco coming forward,
[2708.40 - 2710.40] P:1742.62 E:0.122847 |  and the ball bounces off.
[2710.40 - 2713.40] P:1821.42 E:0.117277 |  And Hernandez is back in there,
[2713.40 - 2716.40] P:1720.74 E:0.119664 |  he's claiming that he didn't get the final touch,
[2716.40 - 2718.40] P:1769.45 E:0.117320 |  but I think he did, and so does the Mexican referee,
[2718.40 - 2722.40] P:1819.79 E:0.114011 |  and it is another corner, and now all of these Moroccan supporters,
[2722.40 - 2725.40] P:1862.95 E:0.104224 |  they're on their feet, they're wheeling their flags,
[2725.40 - 2728.40] P:1793.62 E:0.110943 |  they're jumping up and down, they're doing all they can.
[2728.40 - 2732.40] P:1773.76 E:0.102443 |  They try and help their team muster a goal.
[2732.40 - 2735.40] P:1782.20 E:0.111813 |  Three minutes of added time at the end of this first half.
[2738.40 - 2741.40] P:1736.86 E:0.116109 |  Zeeh waiting to take this, they caused problems with the last one,
[2741.40 - 2743.40] P:1719.16 E:0.100877 |  that was also from that side, the far side.
[2743.40 - 2747.40] P:1702.70 E:0.106378 |  Zeeh now into the six-yard box, Leriz comes, gets something on it,
[2747.40 - 2749.40] P:1701.04 E:0.106053 |  he was being challenged, and the ball bounces down,
[2749.40 - 2753.40] P:1796.17 E:0.099893 |  and he's able to gather it and drop on it, and he has it safe.
[2753.40 - 2757.40] P:1914.78 E:0.108938 |  Yeah, the ball whipped in great pace from Zeeh,
[2757.40 - 2761.40] P:2053.47 E:0.107146 |  and Leriz comes in, five yards out,
[2761.40 - 2764.40] P:2060.35 E:0.112534 |  and he puts him under pressure, drops the first ball,
[2764.40 - 2767.40] P:2077.40 E:0.100704 |  and then pounces on it.
[2768.40 - 2771.40] P:1951.52 E:0.112954 |  Long one over the top from Leriz.
[2771.40 - 2774.40] P:1806.16 E:0.110381 |  Don't see that too often these days, do you?
[2774.40 - 2778.40] P:1708.47 E:0.109424 |  He actually just smacked it right down the middle of the pitch.
[2778.40 - 2780.40] P:1735.88 E:0.095635 |  He's been deflected out of play,
[2780.40 - 2782.40] P:1692.49 E:0.104850 |  he's headed away, deflected out of play.
[2782.40 - 2785.40] P:1703.17 E:0.095472 |  Next to the Moroccan bench, Waleed,
[2785.40 - 2787.40] P:1557.47 E:0.101681 |  Reg Racky is down there, black suit,
[2787.40 - 2790.40] P:1734.97 E:0.116700 |  shaving head, as you probably know by now.
[2790.40 - 2793.40] P:1663.62 E:0.116279 |  And now they come again, and they're being urged on once more,
[2793.40 - 2796.40] P:1665.48 E:0.103668 |  Zeeh now, Zeeh, Hernandez is there,
[2796.40 - 2800.40] P:1622.12 E:0.111989 |  but the cross comes across from the right flank from Hakimi,
[2800.40 - 2802.40] P:1620.54 E:0.114004 |  and it's cleared out of play by Cimini,
[2802.40 - 2805.40] P:1667.96 E:0.113082 |  for throwing ten yards back from the corner flag.
[2805.40 - 2809.40] P:1669.74 E:0.103281 |  They're having a better spell here, Morocco, they're posing a threat.
[2809.40 - 2813.40] P:1601.73 E:0.097162 |  France have got to be careful, throwing this taker,
[2813.40 - 2818.40] P:1692.21 E:0.117236 |  and Mala is there, and as the challenge comes in on him,
[2818.40 - 2822.40] P:1789.65 E:0.113230 |  that sound effects microphone's picked up the blood-curdling cry
[2822.40 - 2826.40] P:1682.14 E:0.105942 |  as he went the ground, and he got the free kick for it as well, Bufal.
[2826.40 - 2828.40] P:1625.22 E:0.096359 |  So it's a free kick out on the right.
[2828.40 - 2835.40] P:1636.00 E:0.113373 |  Silly challenge from Hernandez, right, Morocco, momentum,
[2835.40 - 2839.40] P:1740.46 E:0.117674 |  just before the break.
[2839.40 - 2844.40] P:1755.58 E:0.118242 |  French have really dealt convincingly with the last couple of corners, free kick.
[2844.40 - 2849.40] P:1731.36 E:0.111941 |  This one wide out on that right hand side, the left footed Zeeh will take it.
[2849.40 - 2853.40] P:1713.84 E:0.109693 |  This could be awkward, the angle is really good, he's standing off the pitch,
[2853.40 - 2857.40] P:1661.70 E:0.115059 |  one foot in front of the other, the Chelsea man, left footed plays it in,
[2857.40 - 2859.40] P:1705.65 E:0.117143 |  oh, Laurie's comes, gets a really good punch.
[2859.40 - 2862.40] P:1703.68 E:0.115051 |  There were lots of players in there, both French and Moroccan,
[2862.40 - 2865.40] P:1850.21 E:0.116343 |  and the goalkeeper went in there and got a good punch on it,
[2865.40 - 2868.40] P:1812.77 E:0.114998 |  but Amrabat's won a free kick, sent a field at Morocco, looking to take quick,
[2868.40 - 2870.40] P:1809.35 E:0.110041 |  he just bought a centre-circle, Chris.
[2870.40 - 2874.40] P:1731.29 E:0.108025 |  Yeah, back by not happy with that, because the French would have been away.
[2876.40 - 2879.40] P:1819.04 E:0.118689 |  Just seeing some jostling in the box.
[2879.40 - 2881.40] P:1775.37 E:0.114837 |  Draméry.
[2881.40 - 2882.40] P:1749.72 E:0.110034 |  Yeah.
[2882.40 - 2884.40] P:1759.80 E:0.116001 |  On the nine.
[2884.40 - 2888.40] P:1737.27 E:0.110872 |  And it's good goalkeeping from Maurice, wasn't it?
[2888.40 - 2894.40] P:1669.37 E:0.115298 |  I mean, that's a clear case of wrestling in the penalty area, free kick, Zeeh plays it in,
[2894.40 - 2898.40] P:1731.88 E:0.103618 |  got the stretch, and Mala was trying to get there, but it's beyond him,
[2898.40 - 2901.40] P:1652.66 E:0.106877 |  and that's it, that is the halftime whistle.
[2901.40 - 2903.40] P:1642.55 E:0.108374 |  Well, interesting.
[2903.40 - 2907.40] P:1680.60 E:0.115570 |  Interesting, translating by one goal to Nelteo Hernandez with the early goal
[2907.40 - 2909.40] P:1698.96 E:0.110588 |  that was created by Griezmann.
[2909.40 - 2912.40] P:1651.41 E:0.103051 |  Morocco have had all sorts of problems to deal with,
[2912.40 - 2916.40] P:1484.13 E:0.099308 |  both in terms of the French play, but also having lost Aguierre before kick-off,
[2916.40 - 2920.40] P:1453.28 E:0.105331 |  Dari had to come in, and then losing Saiz after 20 minutes,
[2920.40 - 2925.40] P:1400.61 E:0.098404 |  so that two of that key defenders, not involved in the game anymore,
[2925.40 - 2930.40] P:1407.57 E:0.099701 |  went behind to that goal to Hernandez, Giroud hit a post, another good chance as well.
[2930.40 - 2933.40] P:1413.80 E:0.093752 |  But have caused your problem at the other end, Chris?
[2933.40 - 2937.40] P:1533.66 E:0.095266 |  Yeah, I think Morocco finished the half, the stronger team hit the post,
[2937.40 - 2942.40] P:1541.71 E:0.102396 |  didn't they, from Mel Hamik, and what do we know, they're still in it,
[2942.40 - 2945.40] P:1634.79 E:0.097071 |  going in at halftime, France should have been out of sight.
[2945.40 - 2949.40] P:1561.85 E:0.103324 |  We've talked about, we feel that Morocco should have been awarded a penalty baffled
[2949.40 - 2953.40] P:1436.42 E:0.092323 |  with that decision, but the French lead at halftime.
[2953.40 - 2959.40] P:1447.20 E:0.088680 |  So here in Albayte, up in the north of Doha, France lead Morocco in the semi-final
[2959.40 - 2963.40] P:1456.33 E:0.095156 |  by one goal to Nelteo at halftime, and Marc Chapman's here with us.
[2963.40 - 2967.40] P:1535.52 E:0.093400 |  They've given as good as they've got Morocco, haven't they?
[2967.40 - 2970.40] P:1683.99 E:0.086653 |  I think they finished a half strongly,
[2970.40 - 2974.40] P:1682.69 E:0.097675 |  I thought that the French were pretty much in total control,
[2974.40 - 2980.40] P:1590.25 E:0.097827 |  but the way they finished that half, I think they'll go in, confident that they can hurt this French backline.
[2980.40 - 2983.40] P:1630.24 E:0.103418 |  I think they may be shell-shocked with the nature of the goal,
[2983.40 - 2986.40] P:1703.15 E:0.098210 |  they've been so strong defensively throughout this tournament.
[2986.40 - 2988.40] P:1564.67 E:0.079150 |  And then the French missed a couple of chances,
[2988.40 - 2991.40] P:1627.82 E:0.101097 |  Giroud's been in great form in this tournament, hit the post,
[2991.40 - 2996.40] P:1669.45 E:0.095354 |  slightly unlucky with that one, should have scored from one in and around the penalty spot,
[2997.40 - 3000.40] P:1536.77 E:0.097867 |  we whipped it just past Bono's right-hand post,
[3000.40 - 3005.40] P:1520.11 E:0.094748 |  but Morocco I think would have grown in confidence in the half
[3005.40 - 3008.40] P:1561.59 E:0.100248 |  and thought, you know what, we can cause this French backline.
[3008.40 - 3010.40] P:1662.63 E:0.086497 |  One or two problems?
[3010.40 - 3013.40] P:1689.99 E:0.107994 |  Yeah, I think Chris has been negative again, to be honest.
[3013.40 - 3017.40] P:1777.47 E:0.098082 |  I thought Morocco was absolutely outstanding.
[3017.40 - 3020.40] P:1747.90 E:0.112805 |  I did as well, Mike, I'd say I'm with you on that.
[3020.40 - 3025.40] P:1699.14 E:0.094492 |  And having watched Morocco's games, I thought it was going to be attack-versed defence,
[3025.40 - 3026.40] P:1659.93 E:0.099921 |  and it was anything but.
[3026.40 - 3030.40] P:1735.02 E:0.095823 |  Morocco was on the front-frore, they tried to get forward every time they got the ball,
[3030.40 - 3033.40] P:1654.85 E:0.096717 |  they started the actual game, a lot higher up the pitch,
[3033.40 - 3036.40] P:1692.05 E:0.105920 |  which allowed them to be more involved in the game.
[3036.40 - 3041.40] P:1717.36 E:0.101472 |  It was interesting what France was doing, because they sort of started with 4-3-3,
[3041.40 - 3048.40] P:1743.48 E:0.095226 |  but in possession they went to like a 3-4-3-3-5-2 sort of thing,
[3048.40 - 3051.40] P:1670.56 E:0.095757 |  and Griezmann sort of deploying the number 10,
[3051.40 - 3054.40] P:1665.22 E:0.106485 |  but going wide when they were on the ball,
[3054.40 - 3057.40] P:1636.23 E:0.098447 |  and that was interesting, and obviously Morocco had the injury,
[3057.40 - 3059.40] P:1809.93 E:0.107570 |  so they had to change their formation,
[3059.40 - 3063.40] P:1599.66 E:0.092435 |  but it's been such an intriguing battle, I've absolutely loved it.
[3063.40 - 3066.40] P:1826.41 E:0.097800 |  This is one of my favourite games of the World Cup.
[3066.40 - 3071.40] P:1833.51 E:0.098119 |  I would absolutely agree with you, I think it's been really entertaining,
[3071.40 - 3075.40] P:1781.48 E:0.092271 |  and this place is going to go berserk if Morocco score.
[3075.40 - 3079.40] P:1810.99 E:0.094219 |  Oh, the crowd is brilliant, and every now and then,
[3079.40 - 3082.40] P:1860.67 E:0.097447 |  and every game I've been to, I sort of take one of my earphones off,
[3082.40 - 3087.40] P:1855.85 E:0.094954 |  and see the atmosphere, and the atmosphere has been absolutely electric.
[3087.40 - 3091.40] P:1955.82 E:0.092451 |  If there's a goal in this game, we're going to extra time, I'm telling you that,
[3091.40 - 3093.40] P:1932.97 E:0.108168 |  because the fans will be all the way with them.
[3093.40 - 3096.40] P:1815.23 E:0.096689 |  It's been Chris, are we watching the same game, are we?
[3096.40 - 3100.40] P:1626.93 E:0.095238 |  I don't think so, I think France deserve to be in the lead,
[3100.40 - 3104.40] P:1576.01 E:0.099364 |  Morocco sort of huffed and puffed a bit of momentum towards the end of the half,
[3104.40 - 3108.40] P:1732.61 E:0.098968 |  but I think the French know that it's certainly not game over yet,
[3108.40 - 3110.40] P:1626.57 E:0.083005 |  and they probably will want the second one.
[3110.40 - 3114.40] P:1692.47 E:0.094653 |  When a centre half does an overhead kick from near the edge of the area,
[3114.40 - 3117.40] P:1745.64 E:0.102371 |  and it's the post, it's a good game,
[3117.40 - 3120.40] P:1775.31 E:0.096914 |  and also when the ref is refusing to give fouls,
[3120.40 - 3123.40] P:1691.11 E:0.090696 |  and therefore the game is going at a greater pace,
[3123.40 - 3126.40] P:1794.88 E:0.107872 |  you're in a good game, Jules, have you enjoyed it?
[3126.40 - 3129.40] P:1871.80 E:0.097297 |  Yeah, I have, I have to say.
[3130.40 - 3133.40] P:1918.31 E:0.108929 |  The French are not playing as well as I wish they were,
[3133.40 - 3136.40] P:1953.26 E:0.086233 |  I think it's far too open, especially on the left-hand side,
[3136.40 - 3138.40] P:1898.30 E:0.097946 |  because Mbappe doesn't defend,
[3138.40 - 3143.40] P:1940.92 E:0.093764 |  and as we said in the build-up, the Rabiot not being there is a huge miss.
[3143.40 - 3146.40] P:1771.76 E:0.094615 |  For Fana, he's a good player, not at the level of Rabiot,
[3146.40 - 3149.40] P:2028.42 E:0.110246 |  and you see what they're missing by Rabiot not being there.
[3149.40 - 3151.40] P:2082.69 E:0.099683 |  So it's a bit too open for my liking,
[3151.40 - 3154.40] P:1952.21 E:0.090171 |  but I'll take the one in the lead at halftime.
[3154.40 - 3156.40] P:1874.53 E:0.097137 |  Canard takes played well, no, Jules?
[3156.40 - 3157.40] P:1841.42 E:0.096740 |  Yeah, really well.
[3157.40 - 3161.40] P:1917.81 E:0.083867 |  And we said before that, for me, it's better than Uppameccano,
[3161.40 - 3164.40] P:1994.54 E:0.102413 |  and we saw Ussop in Mccano against Harry, against England.
[3164.40 - 3166.40] P:1891.69 E:0.092245 |  I like Canard to the law,
[3166.40 - 3169.40] P:2099.58 E:0.110349 |  he made a slightly mistake over there by the touchline near the corner flag,
[3169.40 - 3171.40] P:2067.01 E:0.084942 |  when I think he had the ball,
[3171.40 - 3174.40] P:2020.26 E:0.111974 |  and then it was too easy for him to lose it again,
[3174.40 - 3176.40] P:2019.76 E:0.072141 |  but yeah, great talent.
[3177.40 - 3179.40] P:1680.52 E:0.102617 |  Hakimi has caused problems, Mike,
[3179.40 - 3181.40] P:1760.92 E:0.098813 |  hasn't he done that right?
[3181.40 - 3184.40] P:1754.22 E:0.095936 |  That right flank of Morocco has been able to exploit Rabiot
[3184.40 - 3186.40] P:1739.10 E:0.092645 |  not being there for the French.
[3186.40 - 3190.40] P:1794.96 E:0.086810 |  Well, I think that the fact that Killian,
[3190.40 - 3192.40] P:1791.07 E:0.089056 |  Killian and Bbappe, what a player,
[3192.40 - 3195.40] P:1822.30 E:0.100644 |  but defensively, he's nonexistent.
[3195.40 - 3197.40] P:1789.73 E:0.101582 |  I have to agree with Jules on that part,
[3197.40 - 3201.40] P:1868.55 E:0.086003 |  and every time Morocco go down that side, it's 2v1,
[3201.40 - 3205.40] P:1837.95 E:0.097088 |  and it's difficult for Hernandez, you know,
[3205.40 - 3207.40] P:1972.76 E:0.098568 |  German is trying to get over there,
[3207.40 - 3209.40] P:1797.00 E:0.096297 |  Paphana is trying to get over there,
[3209.40 - 3211.40] P:1920.62 E:0.101735 |  but they're getting over there too late.
[3211.40 - 3213.40] P:1927.17 E:0.099377 |  We know Hernandez loves to get forward,
[3213.40 - 3215.40] P:1778.09 E:0.087569 |  which is leaving that space down that right-hand side,
[3215.40 - 3217.40] P:1886.39 E:0.100285 |  but I think Hakimi's been excellent,
[3217.40 - 3219.40] P:1804.52 E:0.090268 |  I think he's been there outlet.
[3219.40 - 3221.40] P:1753.53 E:0.105585 |  I think Amrabat's been brilliant in midfield,
[3221.40 - 3223.40] P:1893.68 E:0.097083 |  every time he gets it, he looks forward
[3223.40 - 3225.40] P:1835.47 E:0.083490 |  for them to go on the counter-attack,
[3225.40 - 3227.40] P:1852.31 E:0.112353 |  and I think he's been really entertaining.
[3227.40 - 3229.40] P:1672.83 E:0.082073 |  Who knows how he looks the best player on the field to me?
[3229.40 - 3231.40] P:1752.58 E:0.075304 |  Yeah, I don't know if John has mentioned
[3231.40 - 3235.40] P:1951.20 E:0.098832 |  the fact that Leicester are very, very keen right now on Asnin,
[3235.40 - 3237.40] P:1970.26 E:0.096741 |  and I think they could make an offer in January for him,
[3237.40 - 3239.40] P:2105.27 E:0.096277 |  like a really high offer.
[3239.40 - 3242.40] P:1921.60 E:0.095749 |  He's a great talent, and we talked about him the other day, I think,
[3242.40 - 3243.40] P:1683.32 E:0.066417 |  together, no?
[3243.40 - 3246.40] P:2021.66 E:0.089424 |  He was in the third division in France 18 months ago,
[3246.40 - 3249.40] P:1961.07 E:0.092686 |  and now to see him play so well at the World Cup,
[3249.40 - 3252.40] P:2064.51 E:0.107477 |  in the semi-final, in the quarter-final, like he did,
[3252.40 - 3256.40] P:2001.88 E:0.084879 |  at such a young age, with very limited experience before.
[3256.40 - 3258.40] P:1798.39 E:0.077180 |  I think it's amazing.
[3258.40 - 3260.40] P:1695.94 E:0.094042 |  It was a penalty, wasn't it, Chris?
[3260.40 - 3263.40] P:1805.26 E:0.090974 |  Yeah, I thought so.
[3263.40 - 3266.40] P:1536.16 E:0.094864 |  I wondered whether I'd missed something just before then
[3266.40 - 3269.40] P:1627.55 E:0.095758 |  for the foul to be given against Morocco and the yellow card.
[3269.40 - 3273.40] P:1570.70 E:0.100987 |  I thought Hernandez clean, Boo fell out, so, I mean, OK,
[3273.40 - 3276.40] P:1598.15 E:0.087504 |  well, I think we can understand that the ref can miss it in real time,
[3276.40 - 3280.40] P:1542.94 E:0.081927 |  but what the hell are the VAR officials doing?
[3280.40 - 3282.40] P:1570.30 E:0.061774 |  Jules?
[3282.40 - 3284.40] P:1894.15 E:0.114511 |  I have to say, I didn't see the replay.
[3284.40 - 3287.40] P:2052.12 E:0.109370 |  I'm not doing Asin Venger. I'm not doing my Asin Venger impression.
[3287.40 - 3289.40] P:1902.15 E:0.080310 |  I need to see it again.
[3289.40 - 3292.40] P:1845.29 E:0.073591 |  Asin the raw with us this evening.
[3292.40 - 3293.40] P:1921.17 E:0.071308 |  Biker?
[3293.40 - 3296.40] P:1875.79 E:0.084055 |  No, a stalemate penalty, you know, and then there's been very well
[3296.40 - 3301.40] P:1891.60 E:0.092978 |  getting the first goal up and down, but I can't understand
[3301.40 - 3303.40] P:1879.52 E:0.088925 |  how that is not a penalty.
[3303.40 - 3307.40] P:1948.75 E:0.079422 |  Like Chris said, they've got the AR. Just look, take your time.
[3307.40 - 3310.40] P:1920.09 E:0.089254 |  There's a game with such magnitude chappers.
[3310.40 - 3312.40] P:1861.58 E:0.089970 |  He stops the ball with his left, doesn't he?
[3312.40 - 3314.40] P:1813.08 E:0.100908 |  I mean, so, Hernandez gets the ball.
[3314.40 - 3319.40] P:1866.22 E:0.087854 |  He stops the ball with his left, but then the ball is further away
[3319.40 - 3322.40] P:1685.50 E:0.095826 |  from the two of them, and then Hernandez's momentum
[3322.40 - 3324.40] P:1811.22 E:0.076724 |  then takes him into Bufa.
[3324.40 - 3327.40] P:1893.49 E:0.099559 |  Yeah, it's a play-in penalty.
[3327.40 - 3329.40] P:1886.38 E:0.078640 |  They've made a massive mistake there.
[3329.40 - 3334.40] P:1966.58 E:0.084856 |  I think because he got that touch initially,
[3334.40 - 3336.40] P:1820.03 E:0.089002 |  that's what might have put them off and think,
[3336.40 - 3339.40] P:1907.76 E:0.089467 |  oh, he's got the ball here, anything after, we don't need to look at.
[3339.40 - 3342.40] P:1875.78 E:0.089208 |  But if you look at the replay again, he's took him out in the box.
[3342.40 - 3344.40] P:1902.73 E:0.092345 |  It should be a penalty.
[3344.40 - 3346.40] P:1769.50 E:0.099603 |  Now, Gary Flint's off our producer.
[3346.40 - 3348.40] P:1838.69 E:0.068320 |  They've had some luck over the years, haven't they, the French?
[3348.40 - 3351.40] P:1818.63 E:0.100629 |  Well, everybody needs a bit of luck sometimes, don't they?
[3351.40 - 3353.40] P:1851.86 E:0.090823 |  Gary Flint's off our producer.
[3353.40 - 3356.40] P:1774.38 E:0.108613 |  When Asin Venger used to say to me, he hadn't seen it in a post-match interview,
[3356.40 - 3359.40] P:1844.17 E:0.098794 |  Gary didn't then get out his phone and show him a clip
[3359.40 - 3361.40] P:1686.39 E:0.096017 |  to then see his reaction.
[3361.40 - 3364.40] P:1871.68 E:0.089233 |  However, he's just done that with you, Jules.
[3364.40 - 3366.40] P:2150.69 E:0.107873 |  Yeah, I think I need to see another angle.
[3366.40 - 3368.40] P:1863.74 E:0.090638 |  I can not see properly.
[3370.40 - 3373.40] P:1702.24 E:0.108669 |  The final thing before we go to the news here is
[3373.40 - 3378.40] P:1528.31 E:0.095650 |  Raghragi when attacking, when Roman Saiz had to come off,
[3378.40 - 3383.40] P:1652.25 E:0.094009 |  he brought on an attack in midfielder and changed the shape.
[3383.40 - 3385.40] P:1718.41 E:0.093796 |  Yeah, that's right.
[3385.40 - 3388.40] P:1882.54 E:0.105891 |  I think to be fair, they probably moved to a back five to protect Saiz,
[3388.40 - 3392.40] P:1975.36 E:0.100653 |  because I don't think he would have been fair enough to play in a back four from the start.
[3392.40 - 3396.40] P:2065.87 E:0.098262 |  I liked as well the Aguard on the team sheet as a distraction
[3396.40 - 3400.40] P:2134.74 E:0.103459 |  because he was never going to play and he was on the starting team.
[3400.40 - 3403.40] P:2154.95 E:0.098268 |  But yeah, after that, you had to go back to four, you won it down.
[3403.40 - 3406.40] P:2134.87 E:0.094554 |  And you know you're a team that can cause problems to France
[3406.40 - 3409.40] P:2145.98 E:0.103244 |  on your right hand side, like we've been saying.
[3409.40 - 3411.40] P:1997.72 E:0.095918 |  So they're going to go even more for it.
[3411.40 - 3416.40] P:2138.48 E:0.089821 |  And I think Mounier, I think that's Mounier warming up, I'm not so sure.
[3416.40 - 3420.40] P:2199.42 E:0.094354 |  So there might be another maybe attacking change to come up at some point,
[3420.40 - 3422.40] P:1996.00 E:0.104912 |  but they have to go for it now.
[3422.40 - 3423.40] P:2292.03 E:0.106041 |  It's the semi-final of the World Cup.
[3423.40 - 3428.40] P:2186.75 E:0.099216 |  You can't be playing that well, but not trying to go even more for it.
[3431.40 - 3437.40] P:1882.66 E:0.107945 |  So as you may be aware, we've had some very eclectic half-time entertainment during this World Cup.
[3438.40 - 3442.40] P:1855.46 E:0.105523 |  Chesley Hawks, a top loader we've had as well.
[3445.40 - 3452.40] P:1813.62 E:0.102653 |  For the two semi-finals, they have picked reel-to-reel, and I like to move it, move it.
[3452.40 - 3456.40] P:1743.66 E:0.101161 |  And he was very good last night, Ertlis Ayl.
[3456.40 - 3459.40] P:1645.81 E:0.106376 |  He's given a slightly different outfit today.
[3459.40 - 3463.40] P:1730.89 E:0.097093 |  I didn't ask you, Michael, whether you knew reel-to-reel.
[3463.40 - 3467.40] P:1903.63 E:0.113714 |  You weren't sure, but then once I sang a bit of the song to you,
[3467.40 - 3472.40] P:1894.90 E:0.099439 |  nowhere near in this guy's league, you knew what it was.
[3472.40 - 3475.40] P:1950.47 E:0.098870 |  This is the half-time entertainment I wanted.
[3475.40 - 3478.40] P:1933.85 E:0.102988 |  We like to move it, move it, Chesley.
[3478.40 - 3481.40] P:1713.40 E:0.106466 |  He's brought a bit of Timber, hasn't he?
[3481.40 - 3482.40] P:1618.95 E:0.112575 |  He's what?
[3482.40 - 3484.40] P:1699.79 E:0.109553 |  He's brought a bit of Timber, hasn't he?
[3484.40 - 3486.40] P:1632.04 E:0.113449 |  Well, we all do in middle age, Michael.
[3486.40 - 3489.40] P:1800.68 E:0.107546 |  Let me tell you, he's not as young as he once was.
[3489.40 - 3492.40] P:1812.29 E:0.114406 |  You were a fan last night, John Murray.
[3492.40 - 3496.40] P:1723.60 E:0.091216 |  You were dancing to this last night, weren't you? Just as a fan?
[3496.40 - 3502.40] P:1831.87 E:0.095886 |  I'm just looking at it. I mean, those shoes are incredible, aren't they?
[3502.40 - 3504.40] P:1715.06 E:0.099433 |  Absolutely.
[3504.40 - 3508.40] P:1822.75 E:0.108800 |  I mean, they're glittering away. The most incredible pair of shoes he's got on.
[3508.40 - 3512.40] P:1836.08 E:0.110871 |  And also, tonight, his trousers legs have both rolled down.
[3512.40 - 3515.40] P:1754.07 E:0.105160 |  He got himself in an unfortunate position last night,
[3515.40 - 3518.40] P:1766.80 E:0.110040 |  and one of his trousers legs rolled up and was by his knee.
[3518.40 - 3520.40] P:1720.96 E:0.122120 |  And the other one was over.
[3520.40 - 3523.40] P:1796.35 E:0.111483 |  And once you're into the moves for a light to move it, move it,
[3523.40 - 3525.40] P:1814.76 E:0.094818 |  it's very hard to adjust your trousers.
[3525.40 - 3529.40] P:1707.62 E:0.115093 |  I think there's diamond-encrusted shoes that he's wearing tonight.
[3529.40 - 3531.40] P:1662.73 E:0.097199 |  Now, that's top class, isn't it?
[3531.40 - 3534.40] P:1742.65 E:0.106472 |  Well, we, of course, have to break off from reel to reel
[3534.40 - 3537.40] P:1573.69 E:0.103332 |  to bring you the latest news, second half of the way.
[3537.40 - 3541.40] P:1357.20 E:0.122875 |  Take the World Cup with you, Qatar 2022.
[3541.40 - 3545.40] P:1508.43 E:0.119790 |  BBC Sound, this is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3545.40 - 3547.40] P:1520.41 E:0.103083 |  With the 5 Live News, I'm Matthew Bone.
[3547.40 - 3550.40] P:1894.11 E:0.095345 |  A six-year-old boy has become the fourth child to die
[3550.40 - 3553.40] P:1830.24 E:0.102195 |  after falling into an icy lake in Sully Hole at the weekend.
[3553.40 - 3557.40] P:1690.37 E:0.116224 |  An eight-year-old, a 10-year-old and 11-year-old had already been confirmed dead
[3557.40 - 3560.40] P:1739.00 E:0.107408 |  after they fell into the water at Babsmill Park on Sunday.
[3560.40 - 3564.40] P:1674.19 E:0.106693 |  Refugee charities say the deaths of four people who drowned after their small boats
[3564.40 - 3568.40] P:1820.79 E:0.108288 |  capsized in the channel this morning highlight the government's failure on migrant issues.
[3568.40 - 3572.40] P:1665.07 E:0.104848 |  Dozens of people were pulled out of the sea in a major rescue operation off the coast of Kent.
[3572.40 - 3576.40] P:1673.33 E:0.109414 |  Ministers say it's a tragic reminder of why the crossings need to be stopped.
[3576.40 - 3581.40] P:1707.24 E:0.107932 |  A man's been jailed for life for murdering the law graduate Zara Alina in East London in June.
[3581.40 - 3584.40] P:1855.59 E:0.120817 |  Jordan McSweeney, who's 29 and from Dagenham,
[3584.40 - 3587.40] P:1621.06 E:0.110166 |  will serve a minimum term of 38 years in prison.
[3587.40 - 3590.40] P:1879.65 E:0.105688 |  And the UK's rate of inflation slowed slightly last month,
[3590.40 - 3593.40] P:1785.06 E:0.093510 |  driven by less steep fuel price increases,
[3593.40 - 3598.40] P:1724.71 E:0.076195 |  but it remains close to a 40-year high with food and drink prices continuing to soar.
[3624.40 - 3627.40] P:1879.69 E:0.112389 |  Listen only on BBC Sound.
[3635.40 - 3638.40] P:1822.55 E:0.082883 |  There's one WSL game tonight,
[3638.40 - 3643.40] P:1873.01 E:0.080079 |  currently Tottenham Nill, Everton 2 at half-time in that game.
[3643.40 - 3648.40] P:1764.87 E:0.085495 |  Here at the Albuytas Stadium, it is France 1, Morocco 0.
[3648.40 - 3651.40] P:1728.77 E:0.088062 |  Waiting for the teams to come back out for the second half.
[3651.40 - 3655.40] P:1760.92 E:0.085497 |  Of course, the winners will play Argentina in the final.
[3655.40 - 3660.40] P:1793.03 E:0.091344 |  Micah Richards, Chris Sutton and John Murray, all withers.
[3660.40 - 3666.40] P:1806.71 E:0.078212 |  Having seen these two for these 45 minutes, Chris, and Argentina last night,
[3666.40 - 3670.40] P:1722.30 E:0.061118 |  it's very difficult to pick a winner, isn't it?
[3670.40 - 3673.40] P:1827.22 E:0.082298 |  Oh, absolutely.
[3673.40 - 3676.40] P:1719.18 E:0.097708 |  I mean, Argentina have been a strange team throughout this competition.
[3676.40 - 3681.40] P:1708.82 E:0.093525 |  They've been a team who have played in moments, even last night,
[3681.40 - 3687.40] P:1656.20 E:0.085061 |  for the first 30 minutes or so, they were pretty average, weren't they?
[3687.40 - 3690.40] P:1697.66 E:0.092538 |  And then, you know, found a bit of form.
[3690.40 - 3694.40] P:1817.64 E:0.078672 |  France are just such a weird outfit, aren't they?
[3694.40 - 3699.40] P:1849.21 E:0.097150 |  They always seem to just do enough to win games,
[3699.40 - 3704.40] P:1679.94 E:0.090412 |  and they don't hit the levels which I think we all expect them to at times.
[3704.40 - 3708.40] P:1666.65 E:0.090270 |  And Morocco are just, I mean, they are depleted.
[3708.40 - 3712.40] P:1670.57 E:0.096447 |  You think that a couple of centre-halves, their mainstay centre-halves,
[3712.40 - 3715.40] P:1692.34 E:0.083761 |  that they've had to change them.
[3715.40 - 3719.40] P:1790.10 E:0.088031 |  We can talk about their character and resilience,
[3719.40 - 3724.40] P:1774.75 E:0.081319 |  but they've got some real quality throughout the team in an attacking sense.
[3724.40 - 3725.40] P:1813.95 E:0.084284 |  We're seeing that.
[3725.40 - 3729.40] P:1852.28 E:0.096542 |  And in many respects, as a game this evening, we needed an early goal,
[3729.40 - 3732.40] P:1682.40 E:0.098102 |  and it's the first time Morocco have gone behind in this tournament,
[3732.40 - 3734.40] P:1777.57 E:0.104327 |  and they are showing their worth.
[3734.40 - 3737.40] P:1711.17 E:0.080020 |  They're trying to take the game to the French, and let's get it right.
[3737.40 - 3742.40] P:1621.21 E:0.109291 |  Nobody's been really convinced about the French defensively this tournament,
[3742.40 - 3746.40] P:1861.05 E:0.102016 |  and Morocco do have to go for a broken the second half.
[3746.40 - 3749.40] P:2056.15 E:0.104717 |  Mike, who won on Argentina last night as well?
[3749.40 - 3755.40] P:2038.07 E:0.103492 |  No, I would agree with Chris, because we tend to always agree on most things.
[3755.40 - 3760.40] P:1970.38 E:0.103843 |  But I think what's gone under the radar with Argentina is how hard they work.
[3760.40 - 3762.40] P:1909.82 E:0.099475 |  They might not be the greaties on the eye,
[3762.40 - 3765.40] P:1963.42 E:0.097534 |  they don't play particularly great football all the time,
[3765.40 - 3770.40] P:1875.93 E:0.092667 |  but they've got that special man Messi with Alvarez, runs in behind,
[3770.40 - 3773.40] P:1800.78 E:0.095038 |  what makes them very difficult to break down,
[3773.40 - 3776.40] P:1771.99 E:0.086589 |  and then they've got the quality on the other end.
[3776.40 - 3778.40] P:1855.58 E:0.086070 |  So yeah, I think if France go through,
[3778.40 - 3784.40] P:1746.30 E:0.099605 |  France-Argentina is going to be a very, very entertaining game.
[3784.40 - 3786.40] P:1796.64 E:0.085933 |  Messi vs. Mbappe.
[3786.40 - 3788.40] P:1801.63 E:0.102437 |  Are they on the edge?
[3788.40 - 3790.40] P:1848.81 E:0.105630 |  Aren't they Argentina?
[3790.40 - 3792.40] P:1886.04 E:0.075409 |  Can we say dirty?
[3792.40 - 3794.40] P:1873.77 E:0.111169 |  No, we can't go, you can't say that.
[3794.40 - 3798.40] P:1795.51 E:0.099416 |  Scrappers, they're on the edge to do anything to win.
[3798.40 - 3802.40] P:1762.36 E:0.087919 |  I was at the Dutch game when Paredes booted the ball.
[3802.40 - 3804.40] P:1763.33 E:0.102988 |  You enjoyed that, even.
[3804.40 - 3808.40] P:1751.10 E:0.093945 |  You don't enjoy much, but you enjoyed that when he booted the ball into the Dutch dugout,
[3808.40 - 3811.40] P:1863.96 E:0.084838 |  and it all kicked off, didn't it?
[3811.40 - 3815.40] P:1803.21 E:0.093439 |  Just occasionally the petty side of things makes me laugh a lot.
[3815.40 - 3819.40] P:1725.14 E:0.105635 |  You were at the game as a fan, of course, John, as we heard during commentary,
[3819.40 - 3823.40] P:1787.89 E:0.093679 |  so you must have enjoyed it, and you had your pre-match Nando's as well.
[3823.40 - 3828.40] P:1928.24 E:0.093202 |  I was there in an observational capacity working at the match.
[3828.40 - 3831.40] P:1854.08 E:0.092346 |  That's what I was doing, preparing for the weekend.
[3831.40 - 3835.40] P:1754.25 E:0.093947 |  So, second half underway in this second semifinal.
[3835.40 - 3838.40] P:1671.58 E:0.107317 |  France leading Morocco by one goal to nil,
[3838.40 - 3842.40] P:1766.38 E:0.093187 |  and Morocco, I guess, had to make another change
[3842.40 - 3845.40] P:1621.49 E:0.096365 |  because the Bayern Munich left back or right back,
[3845.40 - 3849.40] P:1707.29 E:0.096175 |  and Masroura playing as a left back in this game, he's off at halftime.
[3849.40 - 3855.40] P:1608.17 E:0.098627 |  He's had a hip injury, so Yahia Atiat-Ala has come on to replace him.
[3855.40 - 3860.40] P:1459.47 E:0.104624 |  So, another of the experienced men, men who play for the top clubs,
[3860.40 - 3862.40] P:1606.76 E:0.083955 |  has been lost to them here.
[3862.40 - 3866.40] P:1516.51 E:0.099802 |  Atiat-Ala, really impressive against Portugal.
[3866.40 - 3871.40] P:1618.85 E:0.092508 |  Actually got forward to really good effect and crossed the ball in for...
[3871.40 - 3875.40] P:1602.74 E:0.090942 |  ...And the Zürich for his tremendous header.
[3875.40 - 3880.40] P:1625.44 E:0.101930 |  So, it gives them good balance on that left-hand side,
[3880.40 - 3882.40] P:1693.33 E:0.107254 |  but we know what Morocco need to do.
[3882.40 - 3887.40] P:1766.58 E:0.090505 |  I think throughout this tournament, they've sat back in and tried to counter,
[3887.40 - 3890.40] P:1881.76 E:0.101296 |  they'll have to be a different Moroccan team,
[3890.40 - 3892.40] P:2038.31 E:0.111584 |  and they'll have to take the game to the French,
[3892.40 - 3894.40] P:2005.76 E:0.095501 |  and then...
[3894.40 - 3897.40] P:2051.03 E:0.112718 |  ...and the French get a knockout punch.
[3897.40 - 3900.40] P:2025.82 E:0.106170 |  The French, as they start the match with Lloris and Gull,
[3900.40 - 3903.40] P:1972.95 E:0.103345 |  Kunde, Heran, Canate and Hernandez,
[3903.40 - 3908.40] P:1782.60 E:0.094803 |  Trumani and Fafana, Dembele, Griezmann and Bapé and Chiroux.
[3908.40 - 3911.40] P:1928.16 E:0.104919 |  The Gull scored by Théo Hernandez.
[3911.40 - 3913.40] P:2034.78 E:0.110750 |  In the fifth minute of the match, he has Trumani,
[3913.40 - 3916.40] P:1731.84 E:0.114665 |  but he loses balance centre-fields of Morocco,
[3916.40 - 3918.40] P:1696.27 E:0.110690 |  playing from left to right in the second half,
[3918.40 - 3920.40] P:1706.74 E:0.107917 |  bringing forward with Enna Ziri,
[3920.40 - 3922.40] P:1877.53 E:0.104071 |  but France have been able to win it back,
[3922.40 - 3925.40] P:1968.85 E:0.115367 |  and it's played square by Griezmann and now Hernandez.
[3925.40 - 3928.40] P:1922.90 E:0.118448 |  And Bapé runs away and gets away from Hakimi,
[3928.40 - 3930.40] P:1997.32 E:0.106144 |  and Mbappe now, but Amraback comes across,
[3930.40 - 3933.40] P:1961.97 E:0.109529 |  and Bapé has ran in as well into the penalty area,
[3933.40 - 3936.40] P:1870.40 E:0.111221 |  pulls it back, but at pace, however, it's come to Kunde,
[3936.40 - 3939.40] P:1942.07 E:0.108213 |  and Kunde's shot is blocked inside the penalty area,
[3939.40 - 3942.40] P:1754.60 E:0.103626 |  and cleared fire out on the far side
[3942.40 - 3947.40] P:1622.90 E:0.104171 |  for a throw-in down the right-hand side by Amala.
[3947.40 - 3953.40] P:1878.96 E:0.104150 |  Is there a better side in world football than Bapé running?
[3953.40 - 3958.40] P:2023.69 E:0.108561 |  At that speed, there's a terrible decision from Hakimi.
[3958.40 - 3963.40] P:2026.39 E:0.108115 |  Went to ground, dived in, and then Bapé driving towards the Morocco.
[3963.40 - 3967.40] P:2074.68 E:0.107749 |  And go on that left-hand side, little step over through his right leg over the ball,
[3967.40 - 3971.40] P:2069.28 E:0.113909 |  went on the outside of Amraback, not far away with the cross.
[3971.40 - 3973.40] P:2055.98 E:0.105506 |  I don't think there is, Chris.
[3973.40 - 3978.40] P:2014.43 E:0.107495 |  I think it is one of the windows of the game,
[3978.40 - 3981.40] P:2003.02 E:0.110443 |  as it is at the moment to watch him in full flight.
[3981.40 - 3984.40] P:1998.85 E:0.112950 |  Hakimi left on the ground, and Amraback just rounded him,
[3984.40 - 3987.40] P:1939.05 E:0.120061 |  and that's a lovely ball, Chris, playing it through.
[3987.40 - 3990.40] P:1841.08 E:0.108199 |  Oh, and Bapé! After it on the edge of the box,
[3990.40 - 3992.40] P:1835.20 E:0.104322 |  he was shoulder-to-shoulder with a defender.
[3992.40 - 3995.40] P:1675.65 E:0.095800 |  He went down, it was Hakimi who was there with him,
[3995.40 - 4000.40] P:1653.14 E:0.090729 |  and I think there was a collision, actually, with Gorky, but Bono as well.
[4000.40 - 4003.40] P:1681.07 E:0.094215 |  As he came out, I think Bapé's sliding through
[4003.40 - 4006.40] P:1527.62 E:0.093528 |  as he's clattered into Bono on the ground.
[4007.40 - 4009.40] P:1592.96 E:0.112040 |  Danger, danger for Morocco.
[4009.40 - 4013.40] P:1603.13 E:0.103154 |  It's a brilliant reverse pass, too many into Griezmann, Griezmann,
[4013.40 - 4017.40] P:1658.32 E:0.107131 |  and gets the ball on the half-turn, and slides a beautifully weighted pass,
[4017.40 - 4021.40] P:1708.78 E:0.104916 |  left-footed into him, Bapé got on the inside of Hakimi,
[4021.40 - 4025.40] P:1759.86 E:0.107218 |  who just uses his body enough to put Bapé off.
[4025.40 - 4030.40] P:1680.99 E:0.098700 |  Bono off his line quickly, Bapé slides into him,
[4030.40 - 4033.40] P:1663.13 E:0.094450 |  Katie from Hakimi.
[4033.40 - 4036.40] P:1605.31 E:0.096434 |  It's a good contest, that, wasn't it?
[4036.40 - 4042.40] P:1667.74 E:0.102354 |  Hakimi and Bapé really enjoyed that race
[4042.40 - 4045.40] P:1554.07 E:0.094262 |  that we saw the other night with Walker and Bapé.
[4045.40 - 4049.40] P:1566.58 E:0.113277 |  Bapé got the better of Marendre outside,
[4049.40 - 4052.40] P:1533.10 E:0.106449 |  France leading Morocco by one goal to nail,
[4052.40 - 4055.40] P:1617.81 E:0.098781 |  three minutes played in the second half.
[4055.40 - 4058.40] P:1587.10 E:0.109003 |  I think that was part of that first game, when Bapé made a run,
[4058.40 - 4063.40] P:1664.62 E:0.101736 |  I didn't know they could do this, and up on the screen,
[4063.40 - 4067.40] P:1594.34 E:0.107642 |  they put Bapé was up to 35 kilometres an hour.
[4067.40 - 4070.40] P:1628.88 E:0.103601 |  They did that in the match, I saw, but they didn't match as well.
[4070.40 - 4074.40] P:1710.12 E:0.108515 |  As Unahi, combining on the right-hand side with Zeeash,
[4074.40 - 4077.40] P:1685.88 E:0.096624 |  but France are able to deal with that.
[4077.40 - 4079.40] P:1607.65 E:0.106400 |  Hernandez turns and puts it out of play.
[4079.40 - 4082.40] P:1682.55 E:0.115598 |  That's Kashi, kept in by Hakimi against Bapé,
[4082.40 - 4084.40] P:1674.42 E:0.107975 |  and Hakimi's ball to the edge of the box,
[4084.40 - 4086.40] P:1780.13 E:0.112419 |  flicked away by the heel of Tremaini.
[4086.40 - 4089.40] P:1831.99 E:0.116868 |  Dempéli didn't get it away,
[4089.40 - 4091.40] P:1653.40 E:0.100661 |  and Asi Azala is onto this,
[4091.40 - 4096.40] P:1643.93 E:0.102716 |  but gives it back to Amrabat near a half-way line.
[4096.40 - 4098.40] P:1620.49 E:0.114083 |  So France one-nil up.
[4098.40 - 4102.40] P:1651.86 E:0.112772 |  This is a genuinely atmospheric match of this world cup.
[4102.40 - 4106.40] P:1582.27 E:0.106318 |  Huge numbers of Moroccan supporters inside the ground.
[4106.40 - 4110.40] P:1585.50 E:0.111810 |  Zeeash now, Zeeash takes it on, right-footed balls, cleared away by Kanate
[4110.40 - 4112.40] P:1594.97 E:0.107442 |  on the edge of the six-yard box,
[4112.40 - 4114.40] P:1713.68 E:0.116428 |  and then Bapé goes down,
[4114.40 - 4116.40] P:1744.38 E:0.112592 |  claiming he was shoved in the back by Dari.
[4116.40 - 4118.40] P:1766.70 E:0.108434 |  Nothing doing for that.
[4118.40 - 4122.40] P:1687.56 E:0.104019 |  He was waving his hand, maybe a pointed finger at the referee,
[4122.40 - 4124.40] P:1676.95 E:0.116067 |  but the referee's not interested.
[4124.40 - 4128.40] P:1648.60 E:0.109863 |  Unahi then couldn't find the pass forward, bounces back to Amrabat.
[4128.40 - 4130.40] P:1588.36 E:0.100152 |  This is good for Morocco.
[4130.40 - 4133.40] P:1567.02 E:0.101524 |  Back into the centre-circle.
[4133.40 - 4135.40] P:1492.13 E:0.096842 |  Eliamik.
[4135.40 - 4138.40] P:1517.96 E:0.105049 |  Eliamik, who had the overhead kick that hit the post
[4138.40 - 4140.40] P:1498.53 E:0.114853 |  towards the end of the first half.
[4140.40 - 4142.40] P:1643.33 E:0.109836 |  Now on the right-hand side, Zeeash.
[4142.40 - 4146.40] P:1775.72 E:0.115263 |  Oh, lovely with Hakimi, and Hakimi's attempted cross.
[4146.40 - 4148.40] P:1770.11 E:0.110747 |  Hits Kanate, bounces down.
[4148.40 - 4150.40] P:1975.35 E:0.119299 |  And Amrabat now has it.
[4150.40 - 4153.40] P:2003.46 E:0.116124 |  Half-way inside his own half, plays it down the left wing.
[4153.40 - 4156.40] P:1949.41 E:0.115600 |  Amrabat, he's away from Amrabat.
[4156.40 - 4159.40] P:1882.10 E:0.120188 |  Defender Dari, slides in, and Bapé's still going.
[4159.40 - 4162.40] P:1810.87 E:0.115593 |  Amrabat comes back, puts in the challenge and takes the ball.
[4162.40 - 4166.40] P:1811.70 E:0.118471 |  Well, you might have thought that Amrabat was beating him left for dead there,
[4166.40 - 4168.40] P:1740.84 E:0.109088 |  but not so.
[4168.40 - 4170.40] P:1756.12 E:0.112089 |  He got up, chased Amrabat,
[4170.40 - 4173.40] P:1706.84 E:0.111226 |  and put in the tackle on the edge of the penalty area.
[4173.40 - 4175.40] P:1697.49 E:0.112621 |  It was brilliant from Amrabat.
[4175.40 - 4177.40] P:1873.13 E:0.106863 |  It really was.
[4177.40 - 4180.40] P:1883.59 E:0.113287 |  Because once Ambapé gets the run on anybody,
[4180.40 - 4183.40] P:1981.81 E:0.107767 |  they normally finish.
[4183.40 - 4185.40] P:1942.60 E:0.118672 |  And it was a great run, wasn't it, from Ambapé,
[4185.40 - 4189.40] P:2010.38 E:0.112981 |  from deep inside his own half on the touchline.
[4189.40 - 4191.40] P:2024.13 E:0.116447 |  Just turned it into a foot race,
[4191.40 - 4194.40] P:2012.42 E:0.112841 |  and then he's still down Ambapé, but Amrabat,
[4194.40 - 4196.40] P:1899.81 E:0.113797 |  I think he's had a brilliant tournament.
[4196.40 - 4199.40] P:1959.01 E:0.105786 |  One of the players of the tournament just gets back
[4199.40 - 4201.40] P:1832.62 E:0.098155 |  and it's a strong challenge.
[4201.40 - 4203.40] P:1770.77 E:0.115232 |  And if you're a French supporter,
[4203.40 - 4206.40] P:1759.12 E:0.087889 |  that's Ambapé down now for...
[4206.40 - 4208.40] P:1809.53 E:0.106880 |  Well, he's received the treatment.
[4208.40 - 4211.40] P:1661.95 E:0.097592 |  After Amrabat slid in or him took the ball,
[4211.40 - 4214.40] P:1787.47 E:0.104389 |  there was a leap into the air from Ambapé.
[4214.40 - 4216.40] P:1652.97 E:0.098742 |  He's lying on his back.
[4216.40 - 4218.40] P:1544.08 E:0.109834 |  He's just next to the dead ball line.
[4218.40 - 4221.40] P:1637.45 E:0.101916 |  There are two French physios working on him
[4221.40 - 4226.40] P:1683.91 E:0.096957 |  and trying to establish the extent of this.
[4226.40 - 4230.40] P:1649.96 E:0.101988 |  This would be a massive, massive moment.
[4230.40 - 4232.40] P:1663.54 E:0.114703 |  This is a problem for Ambapé.
[4232.40 - 4235.40] P:1686.11 E:0.109444 |  I'm not entirely sure it is
[4235.40 - 4237.40] P:1767.91 E:0.105932 |  in terms of being terminal for this match.
[4237.40 - 4240.40] P:1719.92 E:0.113386 |  And obviously so many people now are looking forward
[4240.40 - 4245.40] P:1712.48 E:0.116407 |  to the prospect of Ambapé and Messi in Lusail on Sunday.
[4245.40 - 4249.40] P:1758.58 E:0.117680 |  Meanwhile, all the time, the Moroccan fans are doing the...
[4249.40 - 4253.40] P:1817.69 E:0.118078 |  Do we call it the Moroccan Thunderclap?
[4253.40 - 4255.40] P:1872.08 E:0.115582 |  That's what they're doing, anyway.
[4255.40 - 4258.40] P:1721.21 E:0.110497 |  And really enjoying themselves.
[4258.40 - 4260.40] P:1581.53 E:0.116769 |  And Ambapé, as play resumes,
[4260.40 - 4263.40] P:1587.14 E:0.115315 |  Ambapé is not back on the field yet.
[4263.40 - 4266.40] P:1563.84 E:0.112917 |  He's walking quite gingerly from the corner flag.
[4266.40 - 4269.40] P:1539.50 E:0.106862 |  So, France currently playing with 10 men.
[4269.40 - 4273.40] P:1594.87 E:0.115794 |  Didier Deschamps won this forward with his arms tightly crossed.
[4273.40 - 4276.40] P:1637.12 E:0.104561 |  That's not great body language from the French coach.
[4276.40 - 4278.40] P:1540.93 E:0.115692 |  And now Xies on the right-hand side.
[4278.40 - 4280.40] P:1663.91 E:0.115730 |  And then the cross from the right.
[4280.40 - 4282.40] P:1841.49 E:0.114888 |  He's got a long way on it.
[4282.40 - 4284.40] P:1755.43 E:0.102268 |  And now he's missed by Atiat Alla,
[4284.40 - 4287.40] P:1619.05 E:0.106097 |  who has arrived on the far side of the penalty area.
[4287.40 - 4289.40] P:1630.90 E:0.107154 |  It bounced off readily for him, actually.
[4289.40 - 4292.40] P:1582.10 E:0.101271 |  So he wasn't able to get anything of...
[4292.40 - 4294.40] P:1754.42 E:0.111575 |  Big chance shot.
[4294.40 - 4298.40] P:1620.08 E:0.103093 |  It really is a good play from Bouffal to get the cross in.
[4298.40 - 4300.40] P:1710.97 E:0.104614 |  And Ambapé is back on the field.
[4300.40 - 4301.40] P:1874.23 E:0.115281 |  Ball is played.
[4301.40 - 4303.40] P:1740.68 E:0.115757 |  Atiat Alla on the left side of the penalty area.
[4303.40 - 4305.40] P:1893.29 E:0.110142 |  Couch back, plays it across.
[4305.40 - 4309.40] P:1728.77 E:0.108597 |  Canate crucially slid in in the six-yard area.
[4309.40 - 4311.40] P:1710.65 E:0.115478 |  And then the shot from Ambapé,
[4311.40 - 4315.40] P:1675.93 E:0.111083 |  which is a bit of a mishit effort from 25 yards.
[4315.40 - 4317.40] P:1719.45 E:0.113592 |  That bounces well away.
[4317.40 - 4320.40] P:1756.81 E:0.113908 |  Big problems being caused by Morocco for the French,
[4320.40 - 4322.40] P:1677.39 E:0.110728 |  who are just about holding out now.
[4322.40 - 4326.40] P:1707.07 E:0.103125 |  What a brilliant run from Atiat Alla on that left-hand side.
[4326.40 - 4328.40] P:1747.26 E:0.112186 |  Got him behind Kunday.
[4328.40 - 4330.40] P:1656.93 E:0.103957 |  The ball slipped on Kunday's inside,
[4330.40 - 4333.40] P:1646.00 E:0.113337 |  and he feeds the ball across.
[4333.40 - 4336.40] P:1765.36 E:0.108954 |  And I've got to say, he's had such a strong game, hasn't he?
[4336.40 - 4338.40] P:1663.77 E:0.105676 |  Canate.
[4338.40 - 4340.40] P:1771.76 E:0.116246 |  Another three yards from his own goal.
[4340.40 - 4343.40] P:1716.07 E:0.109655 |  The middle of the box makes a crucial clearance.
[4343.40 - 4346.40] P:1567.55 E:0.111438 |  He just senses ramping up in it.
[4346.40 - 4349.40] P:1677.57 E:0.118070 |  Something is going to give.
[4349.40 - 4352.40] P:1698.08 E:0.115591 |  France won Morocco nil.
[4352.40 - 4354.40] P:1780.08 E:0.099369 |  BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4354.40 - 4356.40] P:1552.33 E:0.108996 |  Take us with you as well on BBC Sounds.
[4356.40 - 4358.40] P:1594.93 E:0.106445 |  We're across Africa on the World Service,
[4358.40 - 4362.40] P:1683.87 E:0.102368 |  as Baran heads the ball away.
[4362.40 - 4364.40] P:1786.27 E:0.107102 |  And then Giroud challenges for it.
[4364.40 - 4367.40] P:1701.39 E:0.101149 |  And the ball bounces out of play on the far side.
[4367.40 - 4370.40] P:1663.96 E:0.102376 |  Off the Frenchman for a throw-in to Morocco.
[4370.40 - 4373.40] P:1540.52 E:0.100190 |  Match on BBC One tonight as well, if you're on your way home.
[4373.40 - 4376.40] P:1519.05 E:0.104977 |  Steve Wilson and Danny Murphy with a commentary on BBC One.
[4376.40 - 4379.40] P:1567.00 E:0.102165 |  So watch it there, or on the iPlayer.
[4379.40 - 4382.40] P:1557.56 E:0.106091 |  But also, you can listen to the 5 Live Radio commentary
[4382.40 - 4384.40] P:1594.44 E:0.108440 |  if you prefer sync-book of the pictures.
[4384.40 - 4389.40] P:1663.56 E:0.111713 |  On World Cup Extra, which is a special feature for the World Cup.
[4389.40 - 4391.40] P:1628.37 E:0.101966 |  So here is Zeeh.
[4391.40 - 4393.40] P:1735.42 E:0.102244 |  Zeeh to the right.
[4393.40 - 4395.40] P:1705.92 E:0.109260 |  Touch from Hakini.
[4395.40 - 4397.40] P:1696.14 E:0.116671 |  And now he's gone down.
[4397.40 - 4399.40] P:1909.59 E:0.110711 |  It's a challenge by...
[4402.40 - 4403.40] P:2025.79 E:0.108489 |  ...Pafana.
[4403.40 - 4405.40] P:2002.84 E:0.110135 |  And that is not a free kick.
[4405.40 - 4407.40] P:1838.55 E:0.112073 |  And France are able to clear the way down here.
[4407.40 - 4410.40] P:1714.57 E:0.107594 |  And the French, they cannot get out at this moment in time.
[4410.40 - 4412.40] P:1613.51 E:0.109212 |  It's wave after wave, isn't it?
[4412.40 - 4414.40] P:1667.16 E:0.086992 |  A rock and a tax.
[4414.40 - 4416.40] P:1494.87 E:0.098150 |  I think Julian Loran at half-time was right.
[4416.40 - 4419.40] P:1522.27 E:0.099087 |  You know, Rabiot has been a big miss for them in this match.
[4419.40 - 4421.40] P:1542.21 E:0.108581 |  He's out. He's not very well.
[4421.40 - 4424.40] P:1616.53 E:0.104660 |  Same for Obamacano.
[4424.40 - 4431.40] P:1709.77 E:0.111985 |  So for Farnas coming to play in that midfield role that Rabiot was playing,
[4431.40 - 4434.40] P:1694.35 E:0.108685 |  Zeeh has been really bright up to me.
[4434.40 - 4437.40] P:1930.16 E:0.113181 |  And now importantly, Kunde steps forward.
[4437.40 - 4441.40] P:1906.86 E:0.116640 |  And then it bounces away off to Anani out of play for a train
[4441.40 - 4444.40] P:1884.29 E:0.104190 |  on the far side for the French.
[4445.40 - 4450.40] P:2081.27 E:0.116027 |  They build up a really good head of steam, didn't they, Morocco?
[4450.40 - 4454.40] P:2115.96 E:0.116263 |  In the last 10 minutes of the first half, they've carried it on.
[4454.40 - 4457.40] P:2110.03 E:0.115530 |  In the second half, the ball's just going into Giroud.
[4457.40 - 4459.40] P:2162.96 E:0.117668 |  He needs to make it stick for the French.
[4459.40 - 4461.40] P:2037.60 E:0.108728 |  He hasn't done that.
[4461.40 - 4463.40] P:1873.00 E:0.117637 |  Giroud, handling for it again.
[4463.40 - 4465.40] P:1755.88 E:0.111268 |  The ball's out of play. It's a Moroccan throw.
[4465.40 - 4468.40] P:1677.55 E:0.101293 |  Well, you did say, Chris, that they might rue those chances
[4468.40 - 4470.40] P:1534.14 E:0.107837 |  that they had in the first half.
[4470.40 - 4472.40] P:1636.74 E:0.096670 |  Giroud hitting the post.
[4472.40 - 4475.40] P:1559.79 E:0.111246 |  The big chance between the penalty spot and the edge of the area.
[4475.40 - 4477.40] P:1537.60 E:0.107446 |  Loran with an opportunity.
[4477.40 - 4479.40] P:1687.59 E:0.113142 |  Late in the first period.
[4479.40 - 4481.40] P:1732.45 E:0.109506 |  And now it is Morocco coming forward again.
[4481.40 - 4483.40] P:1688.05 E:0.093937 |  Hakimi.
[4483.40 - 4487.40] P:1627.27 E:0.111526 |  And then Zeeh to Hakimi.
[4487.40 - 4489.40] P:1670.87 E:0.122282 |  Anani is there as well.
[4489.40 - 4491.40] P:1705.71 E:0.116741 |  Anani allows this to run.
[4491.40 - 4493.40] P:1652.39 E:0.111788 |  Zeeh back to Anani inside the penalty area.
[4493.40 - 4495.40] P:1734.74 E:0.118667 |  Lots of blue shirts in there.
[4495.40 - 4497.40] P:1778.25 E:0.113245 |  Turn from Hakimi, but Griezmann comes in
[4497.40 - 4499.40] P:1880.92 E:0.106291 |  and arrives on the scene for the French.
[4499.40 - 4501.40] P:1938.09 E:0.120313 |  And Bapé away.
[4501.40 - 4503.40] P:1849.25 E:0.117583 |  It seems to be OK.
[4503.40 - 4505.40] P:1737.65 E:0.118959 |  Always down on the ground again after losing out this time.
[4505.40 - 4507.40] P:1715.16 E:0.115993 |  Ball's played to Zeeh on the right flank.
[4507.40 - 4509.40] P:1709.90 E:0.119968 |  Zeeh takes on Hernandez and the ball runs away.
[4509.40 - 4512.40] P:1617.58 E:0.113588 |  They're both claiming that it was the final touch
[4512.40 - 4515.40] P:1808.85 E:0.112083 |  from the other man, referee Ramos.
[4515.40 - 4518.40] P:1955.31 E:0.112082 |  Says final touch off Zeeh's goal kick.
[4518.40 - 4520.40] P:1997.63 E:0.104807 |  Yeah, Hernandez struggling to cope with Zeeh.
[4520.40 - 4522.40] P:2087.36 E:0.118539 |  In those 1v1 situations,
[4522.40 - 4524.40] P:2071.54 E:0.107153 |  the ball popped out.
[4524.40 - 4527.40] P:1995.89 E:0.111924 |  Lovely pass from Amra about that right again.
[4527.40 - 4532.40] P:1974.48 E:0.115007 |  Zeeh rather than come inside on his favourite left foot,
[4532.40 - 4536.40] P:1992.03 E:0.110718 |  giving Hernandez something to think about driving the outside.
[4536.40 - 4538.40] P:2008.71 E:0.112342 |  An occasion for Morocco not getting the corner,
[4538.40 - 4540.40] P:2004.92 E:0.110598 |  but on Bapé down.
[4540.40 - 4542.40] P:2042.39 E:0.109335 |  Down again.
[4542.40 - 4544.40] P:2015.30 E:0.117317 |  It was Darry this time,
[4544.40 - 4547.40] P:2002.63 E:0.113784 |  the central defender whose challenge has left.
[4547.40 - 4550.40] P:1992.07 E:0.118910 |  And Bapé on the ground, sitting on his backside.
[4550.40 - 4552.40] P:2012.09 E:0.119454 |  He's leaning up.
[4552.40 - 4554.40] P:2068.97 E:0.105360 |  He's got a broken shoelace, John.
[4554.40 - 4556.40] P:2041.11 E:0.111543 |  Drama. Do you think that?
[4556.40 - 4558.40] P:2046.31 E:0.115847 |  You think he might still be OK for the final
[4558.40 - 4560.40] P:2049.57 E:0.108971 |  if France get through?
[4560.40 - 4563.40] P:2043.63 E:0.115360 |  But I think Gidier Deschamps
[4563.40 - 4565.40] P:2055.67 E:0.110129 |  is actually going to make the change here.
[4567.40 - 4569.40] P:1892.84 E:0.115225 |  Now, is that going to be it?
[4569.40 - 4572.40] P:1813.50 E:0.103509 |  Is that going to be the end of the night from Bapé?
[4572.40 - 4574.40] P:1721.04 E:0.109380 |  He's running towards this side of the field,
[4574.40 - 4576.40] P:1631.88 E:0.096463 |  but there's a member of the staff just coming forward.
[4576.40 - 4579.40] P:1846.94 E:0.102320 |  They've actually got another boot to fix that problem
[4579.40 - 4582.40] P:1778.00 E:0.100389 |  with the shoelace, Chris.
[4582.40 - 4584.40] P:1796.68 E:0.122128 |  Not like the old days, John,
[4584.40 - 4587.40] P:1746.68 E:0.101829 |  where they've had to patch that one up.
[4587.40 - 4589.40] P:1781.96 E:0.113943 |  He's got a golden boot.
[4589.40 - 4591.40] P:1816.70 E:0.115819 |  He's put on his left foot,
[4591.40 - 4593.40] P:1731.06 E:0.116305 |  but they aren't going to make a change
[4593.40 - 4595.40] P:1815.30 E:0.114170 |  by the looks of it that the Frenchman
[4595.40 - 4597.40] P:1719.40 E:0.111686 |  can't be in Bapé.
[4597.40 - 4600.40] P:1553.34 E:0.115027 |  A nation breeze, a sigh of relief.
[4600.40 - 4602.40] P:1683.40 E:0.112208 |  The shoelace has been fixed,
[4602.40 - 4604.40] P:1622.81 E:0.108543 |  and Bapé will play on.
[4604.40 - 4607.40] P:1841.77 E:0.105498 |  Now the ball is through the middle with
[4607.40 - 4610.40] P:1967.87 E:0.113666 |  an overhead pass from centrefield from Fouffarno.
[4610.40 - 4612.40] P:1799.14 E:0.110820 |  That just wins the way through,
[4612.40 - 4614.40] P:1696.56 E:0.104551 |  and it is a goal kick to Morocco,
[4614.40 - 4617.40] P:1629.21 E:0.104904 |  who are enjoying the better of things at the moment.
[4617.40 - 4619.40] P:1554.07 E:0.089804 |  Morocco.
[4619.40 - 4621.40] P:1575.24 E:0.107816 |  There you are, but I mean,
[4621.40 - 4624.40] P:1754.44 E:0.109544 |  I said at halftime, the French are a strange team.
[4624.40 - 4629.40] P:1638.32 E:0.094271 |  World champions, they don't really like to dominate the ball
[4629.40 - 4632.40] P:1672.64 E:0.104449 |  in games, and there's Morocco, who...
[4632.40 - 4635.40] P:1668.90 E:0.098928 |  Look at their possession stats throughout the tournament.
[4635.40 - 4638.40] P:1652.48 E:0.097562 |  They have been the counter-attack team, haven't they?
[4638.40 - 4640.40] P:1697.03 E:0.109900 |  But they're taking the game to the French pushing,
[4640.40 - 4642.40] P:1620.60 E:0.074121 |  the French back.
[4643.40 - 4645.40] P:1568.48 E:0.113516 |  Morocco, according to the screen to my left,
[4645.40 - 4650.40] P:1592.10 E:0.100573 |  have got 50% possession control at the moment.
[4652.40 - 4656.40] P:1690.03 E:0.108281 |  Otherwise known as 59.2% possession.
[4658.40 - 4660.40] P:1649.79 E:0.115175 |  Morocco play back into...
[4660.40 - 4663.40] P:1616.43 E:0.105595 |  You can explain that to me on the drive-back, John.
[4663.40 - 4666.40] P:1536.77 E:0.111279 |  Well, I've been asking my summarisers all through this World Cup,
[4666.40 - 4668.40] P:1491.07 E:0.097111 |  Chris, about it, and I thought,
[4668.40 - 4670.40] P:1553.87 E:0.105533 |  of all of the summarisers,
[4670.40 - 4673.40] P:1566.90 E:0.107949 |  who would come up with the answer and work that one out?
[4673.40 - 4675.40] P:1682.00 E:0.112781 |  It would be Chris Sutton.
[4676.40 - 4679.40] P:1658.82 E:0.106473 |  Morocco come again on the right-hand side.
[4679.40 - 4681.40] P:1671.10 E:0.110984 |  And...
[4681.40 - 4684.40] P:1766.28 E:0.114670 |  just stepped in by Tua Mayn, to win it back for French,
[4684.40 - 4687.40] P:2022.24 E:0.119197 |  as the cross comes over from Biffal.
[4687.40 - 4690.40] P:1975.42 E:0.119452 |  And France then play forward, 0-2, and Babe,
[4690.40 - 4692.40] P:1997.26 E:0.112421 |  and Babe back onto his right foot,
[4692.40 - 4694.40] P:2002.71 E:0.116830 |  square to Griezmann, left foot shot from Griezmann,
[4694.40 - 4698.40] P:1724.19 E:0.113920 |  big deflection, but that could get wide of goal, and in any case...
[4698.40 - 4701.40] P:1666.08 E:0.117023 |  I think this is infuriating, I think,
[4701.40 - 4704.40] P:1605.93 E:0.098653 |  for fans in the stadium.
[4704.40 - 4707.40] P:1674.13 E:0.106769 |  The Moroccan team, because he was clearly offside,
[4707.40 - 4709.40] P:1726.60 E:0.095996 |  and Babe shouldn't be offside,
[4709.40 - 4711.40] P:1630.73 E:0.095082 |  hanging out in that left-hand channel.
[4711.40 - 4714.40] P:1633.67 E:0.100289 |  Looks across the line, runs too early.
[4717.40 - 4719.40] P:1682.57 E:0.112586 |  Morocco back into possession.
[4719.40 - 4722.40] P:1605.35 E:0.115970 |  Biffal with a ball back into his own half.
[4722.40 - 4725.40] P:1603.90 E:0.112446 |  Biffal, who plays in France for Angers,
[4725.40 - 4728.40] P:1670.86 E:0.110915 |  who are actually currently bottom of the French league,
[4728.40 - 4731.40] P:1604.04 E:0.108051 |  is on the left-hand side, and he's playing for the French.
[4731.40 - 4734.40] P:1570.63 E:0.108954 |  But here, him and his team are causing problems,
[4734.40 - 4737.40] P:1583.86 E:0.113951 |  even though France lead by one goal to nil.
[4737.40 - 4739.40] P:1651.27 E:0.118834 |  How high up the key he's playing,
[4739.40 - 4742.40] P:1617.85 E:0.104748 |  the Moroccan right-back in the inside channel.
[4742.40 - 4744.40] P:1680.94 E:0.098946 |  Zee Esch comes wide.
[4744.40 - 4749.40] P:1623.13 E:0.102667 |  Biffal on the drift, the left-inside.
[4749.40 - 4752.40] P:1644.46 E:0.109964 |  Just with a pass from Dari, but that's cut out by Kunde,
[4752.40 - 4754.40] P:1930.85 E:0.114887 |  now Griezmann gets away,
[4754.40 - 4757.40] P:1976.45 E:0.109167 |  but then just puts back, and is caught by Atiat Al-Aq.
[4757.40 - 4761.40] P:1847.73 E:0.105987 |  Atiat Al-Aq, so that's a free kick, just a little trip in a free kick.
[4761.40 - 4765.40] P:1741.68 E:0.105365 |  And actually, France will very happily just slow things down here,
[4765.40 - 4767.40] P:1805.62 E:0.097110 |  break up the play,
[4767.40 - 4770.40] P:1879.56 E:0.106210 |  and Scott Morocco getting the kind of momentum
[4770.40 - 4773.40] P:1944.68 E:0.105052 |  that they've built up at times in the second half.
[4773.40 - 4778.40] P:2023.03 E:0.116184 |  Absolutely right, Griezmann in no rush to get up.
[4778.40 - 4780.40] P:2005.56 E:0.112637 |  They haven't got a foothold.
[4780.40 - 4783.40] P:2009.19 E:0.113740 |  It's gone to talk in the second half.
[4784.40 - 4788.40] P:2073.24 E:0.113955 |  Continuation, really, of what we saw in the latter stages
[4788.40 - 4790.40] P:2039.73 E:0.118359 |  of the first period, Griezmann.
[4790.40 - 4793.40] P:1851.43 E:0.112810 |  Now, after France took that free kick,
[4793.40 - 4798.40] P:1766.06 E:0.114456 |  but Amrabap went the fourth 360 degrees twice there
[4798.40 - 4801.40] P:1743.08 E:0.094541 |  to get away from Griezmann,
[4801.40 - 4803.40] P:1686.78 E:0.108935 |  and then it's out of play to throw into Morocco.
[4803.40 - 4805.40] P:1603.19 E:0.102138 |  They are all hustle and bustle.
[4805.40 - 4807.40] P:1602.07 E:0.102660 |  They are all urgency.
[4807.40 - 4810.40] P:1663.59 E:0.117634 |  Waleed Regraggi, the coach,
[4810.40 - 4815.40] P:1659.07 E:0.117111 |  and his white trainers, just like Gianni Infantino up in the stands,
[4815.40 - 4817.40] P:1661.05 E:0.110864 |  sitting next to President Macron.
[4817.40 - 4819.40] P:1635.93 E:0.118634 |  It's been uncomfortable.
[4819.40 - 4821.40] P:1716.43 E:0.108753 |  Watch this for the French president,
[4821.40 - 4823.40] P:1560.35 E:0.109616 |  as Morocco played down into the full-back position.
[4823.40 - 4825.40] P:1485.30 E:0.103023 |  Hernandez is able to put in the cross
[4825.40 - 4828.40] P:1628.36 E:0.100475 |  and stops the ball in the quadrant and chips it away.
[4828.40 - 4831.40] P:1663.62 E:0.116301 |  But that's back to the mainly red shirts of Morocco,
[4831.40 - 4835.40] P:1609.60 E:0.118903 |  with the green trim, green shorts, white socks.
[4835.40 - 4838.40] P:1593.51 E:0.113840 |  Hakimi now on the right-hand side comes back in,
[4838.40 - 4841.40] P:1438.04 E:0.113507 |  just snaps it back to the halfway line away from Chiroux.
[4841.40 - 4844.40] P:1488.53 E:0.100339 |  So, Dari, square to El Yameek,
[4844.40 - 4849.40] P:1501.49 E:0.108119 |  and then Amrabap drops towards the centre-circle again.
[4849.40 - 4853.40] P:1553.88 E:0.118078 |  Dari, now to the right-hand side,
[4853.40 - 4857.40] P:1636.85 E:0.109360 |  and taken on, promisingly by Brufale.
[4857.40 - 4859.40] P:1692.55 E:0.115243 |  He goes round the outside and pulls it back.
[4859.40 - 4862.40] P:1641.49 E:0.100228 |  Griezmann's there inside his own penalty area as well.
[4862.40 - 4864.40] P:1595.49 E:0.107264 |  He has covered some ground with Griezmann.
[4864.40 - 4867.40] P:1696.49 E:0.120006 |  He's very often there in the penalty area,
[4867.40 - 4869.40] P:1644.75 E:0.104110 |  and he's a very extra man,
[4869.40 - 4871.40] P:1558.71 E:0.097452 |  and he's very often there as the man who breaks forward.
[4871.40 - 4874.40] P:1543.04 E:0.104082 |  But it is Morocco who again are asking questions
[4874.40 - 4876.40] P:1448.93 E:0.096452 |  at this French side, the holders.
[4876.40 - 4879.40] P:1451.64 E:0.098101 |  One near look, but on the back foot in the second half.
[4879.40 - 4884.40] P:1668.16 E:0.107369 |  Square, Dari to the right, to Hakimi.
[4884.40 - 4888.40] P:1673.24 E:0.112259 |  And then Hernandez just forces him to give it back to...
[4888.40 - 4890.40] P:1655.16 E:0.107105 |  ..the number eight, Anahi.
[4890.40 - 4893.40] P:1624.92 E:0.114770 |  And now Ziaz, left foot across from the right,
[4893.40 - 4896.40] P:1686.49 E:0.090984 |  that's headed down and away by Varan.
[4896.40 - 4900.40] P:1981.46 E:0.117991 |  And then Babi, eventually gets that bouncing ball down.
[4900.40 - 4902.40] P:1943.49 E:0.113931 |  Tries to go round the outside,
[4902.40 - 4904.40] P:1872.64 E:0.116311 |  and then the covering challenge from Anahi,
[4904.40 - 4907.40] P:1746.44 E:0.113669 |  he slides in and puts it out of play for a free
[4907.40 - 4910.40] P:1800.17 E:0.105835 |  to the French, just inside Moroccan territory.
[4910.40 - 4914.40] P:1805.59 E:0.114996 |  Not offering a great deal at the moment, are they, the French?
[4914.40 - 4917.40] P:1855.68 E:0.112335 |  Oh, they're not that hanging on in there.
[4917.40 - 4921.40] P:1959.72 E:0.114748 |  Moroccan team taking the game to France,
[4921.40 - 4923.40] P:2016.93 E:0.117173 |  pushing them back,
[4924.40 - 4927.40] P:2036.49 E:0.117093 |  testing that French back line who have held strong
[4927.40 - 4929.40] P:2149.77 E:0.113360 |  in those firms so far,
[4929.40 - 4932.40] P:2085.53 E:0.114654 |  but looking a minute, aren't they?
[4932.40 - 4936.40] P:2085.96 E:0.117318 |  Bouffal has been prominent, Ziaz, in this second half.
[4938.40 - 4941.40] P:2087.27 E:0.117969 |  The whistles because the French in possession,
[4941.40 - 4944.40] P:2083.10 E:0.116982 |  you might have just faintly been able to pick out
[4944.40 - 4947.40] P:2091.75 E:0.121007 |  a little chorus of Allée Le Bleu in the middle of that,
[4947.40 - 4949.40] P:2041.75 E:0.113552 |  but totally drowned out.
[4949.40 - 4952.40] P:2021.36 E:0.118060 |  Long pass from Pinate, Griezmann, no, to Dampale.
[4952.40 - 4955.40] P:1887.11 E:0.115443 |  Dampale with the crosser behind Chiroux,
[4955.40 - 4958.40] P:1693.15 E:0.111642 |  and Babi wasn't in there either.
[4958.40 - 4961.40] P:1619.47 E:0.115944 |  So Hakimi was able to say thank you very much,
[4961.40 - 4965.40] P:1598.11 E:0.113135 |  and Morocco bring it away from people inside their own heart.
[4967.40 - 4969.40] P:1713.93 E:0.106583 |  More warm applause.
[4969.40 - 4972.40] P:1563.75 E:0.106089 |  You can see a half moon, a desert moon,
[4972.40 - 4977.40] P:1584.65 E:0.102401 |  slightly pinkish up there in the black skies of the Gulf
[4977.40 - 4981.40] P:1586.72 E:0.107375 |  through the open roof of this stadium with Amrabat.
[4982.40 - 4985.40] P:1619.54 E:0.104917 |  And then, getting it short to Bouffal,
[4985.40 - 4988.40] P:1845.52 E:0.113015 |  takes it on, tried to play it for the lefties,
[4988.40 - 4990.40] P:1899.59 E:0.109731 |  suggesting that he'd got a contraction,
[4990.40 - 4992.40] P:1865.01 E:0.105607 |  but it's a French thrill.
[4992.40 - 4994.40] P:1847.18 E:0.123110 |  There's a fiery character as me, Bouffal,
[4994.40 - 4997.40] P:1962.08 E:0.116198 |  speaking to Michael earlier about him,
[4997.40 - 4999.40] P:1977.42 E:0.114873 |  what you can play at Sir Sassampton.
[4999.40 - 5003.40] P:1963.56 E:0.119656 |  Temperamental, one week, he would be absolutely brilliant,
[5003.40 - 5006.40] P:1967.11 E:0.114652 |  and then next week you'd go missing.
[5008.40 - 5011.40] P:1997.09 E:0.117454 |  Playing with confidence, and a zip and a zest.
[5012.40 - 5017.40] P:1960.37 E:0.117271 |  Looking at threat, drifting near there and everywhere from Morocco.
[5017.40 - 5019.40] P:1953.42 E:0.115214 |  Well, France have made a change,
[5019.40 - 5021.40] P:2065.22 E:0.115690 |  but it's Olivier Chiroux who is substituted.
[5021.40 - 5024.40] P:2030.16 E:0.104260 |  So the number nine is off the record scorer,
[5024.40 - 5026.40] P:2028.45 E:0.100786 |  and it is Marcus Turan,
[5026.40 - 5028.40] P:1822.22 E:0.110846 |  we were talking about Lilian in the first half, weren't we?
[5028.40 - 5030.40] P:1792.06 E:0.105101 |  Well, his son, Marcus, comes on,
[5030.40 - 5033.40] P:1952.10 E:0.099593 |  another substitute appearance at this World Cup.
[5033.40 - 5035.40] P:1983.15 E:0.113553 |  So it looks as though in Batman through the middle,
[5035.40 - 5037.40] P:2042.36 E:0.110227 |  and here is Marcus Turan now down the left-hand side.
[5037.40 - 5039.40] P:2027.65 E:0.113095 |  Turan then runs into Hakimi,
[5039.40 - 5041.40] P:1859.79 E:0.113327 |  but there is Kuba there as well,
[5041.40 - 5044.40] P:1727.24 E:0.112836 |  from Zeeh to Rammstil persistent,
[5044.40 - 5046.40] P:1637.74 E:0.116394 |  with a ball standing behind,
[5046.40 - 5049.40] P:1813.07 E:0.111153 |  and it is a goal kick to Morocco.
[5049.40 - 5051.40] P:1753.37 E:0.108266 |  Yeah, and then back eight,
[5051.40 - 5055.40] P:1758.52 E:0.103999 |  he's gone into that central striking position.
[5057.40 - 5060.40] P:1720.72 E:0.110812 |  Yeah, I just wonder that decision whether, I don't think,
[5060.40 - 5063.40] P:1767.00 E:0.108581 |  Olivier Chiroux had an injury at all,
[5063.40 - 5066.40] P:1779.66 E:0.103407 |  as Morocco made a substitution.
[5067.40 - 5072.40] P:1777.67 E:0.107559 |  Morocco also making a double change, actually.
[5072.40 - 5075.40] P:1650.24 E:0.101909 |  They're going to bring on the number nine, Hamdallah,
[5075.40 - 5081.40] P:1610.40 E:0.104238 |  and also Abouklo, the Toulouse player,
[5081.40 - 5085.40] P:1513.54 E:0.098914 |  so another French-based player, the number 14, coming on.
[5085.40 - 5092.40] P:1608.38 E:0.106560 |  And N'aziri making way for Hamdallah,
[5092.40 - 5098.40] P:1653.29 E:0.098967 |  and the other player to come off is Bouffal.
[5098.40 - 5100.40] P:1470.22 E:0.100025 |  So that's it for Bouffal.
[5100.40 - 5102.40] P:1522.47 E:0.104860 |  He was on a yellow card, I suppose,
[5102.40 - 5110.40] P:1541.56 E:0.096952 |  but even so, double change from the Moroccan coach.
[5110.40 - 5113.40] P:1720.40 E:0.092758 |  So that is now, he's made four changes now,
[5113.40 - 5116.40] P:1576.17 E:0.098633 |  having had to take Saïs off in the first half,
[5116.40 - 5118.40] P:1671.49 E:0.103344 |  taking off Maserawi at half-time,
[5118.40 - 5120.40] P:1513.03 E:0.106015 |  which I guess he probably had to do as well,
[5120.40 - 5122.40] P:1610.09 E:0.080015 |  because he wasn't fully fit.
[5122.40 - 5125.40] P:1614.39 E:0.097749 |  And they're still in this, one-nil France lead.
[5125.40 - 5128.40] P:1516.43 E:0.085665 |  Zeeh, more centrally this time.
[5128.40 - 5130.40] P:1579.40 E:0.111015 |  Let's put a ball down for Ran,
[5130.40 - 5132.40] P:1782.27 E:0.104751 |  threw himself into that.
[5132.40 - 5135.40] P:1683.92 E:0.103582 |  Trouscum's over from the left-hand side from Atiat Al-Abbat.
[5135.40 - 5138.40] P:1683.57 E:0.099688 |  Lloris is able to dive forward and catch the ball.
[5138.40 - 5141.40] P:1762.76 E:0.093739 |  And there's Abouklo.
[5141.40 - 5143.40] P:1816.81 E:0.118255 |  It's a little bit too high for him,
[5143.40 - 5146.40] P:1853.68 E:0.092361 |  the cross he's gone out to that left-hand side.
[5146.40 - 5150.40] P:1900.55 E:0.109028 |  Bouffal was positioned from the Rocco.
[5150.40 - 5152.40] P:1908.71 E:0.106361 |  I'm surprised at that substitution, though.
[5152.40 - 5157.40] P:1820.05 E:0.095265 |  Bouffal had looked a threat all evening.
[5157.40 - 5161.40] P:1918.68 E:0.108824 |  Central striker, James Handalak coming on.
[5161.40 - 5167.40] P:1991.76 E:0.109995 |  Maserawi really scarved of service.
[5167.40 - 5173.40] P:2005.40 E:0.111324 |  Yeah, so throwing four France down the left-hand side.
[5173.40 - 5175.40] P:1987.20 E:0.115268 |  Two-round, gets it down,
[5175.40 - 5178.40] P:2024.06 E:0.115860 |  but it's very tight there, there are two Moroccan players with him.
[5178.40 - 5180.40] P:1863.69 E:0.112012 |  And then two-round goes down,
[5180.40 - 5182.40] P:1862.90 E:0.106076 |  the challenge came in on him.
[5182.40 - 5184.40] P:1826.68 E:0.079356 |  That is given as a free kick.
[5184.40 - 5187.40] P:1796.31 E:0.107440 |  Hakimi just put in the challenge, down he went,
[5187.40 - 5190.40] P:1866.46 E:0.094229 |  free kick near the corner flag on the left-hand side.
[5190.40 - 5193.40] P:1894.65 E:0.097479 |  Yeah, and this suits France.
[5193.40 - 5196.40] P:1926.84 E:0.093623 |  It's the game.
[5196.40 - 5199.40] P:1979.03 E:0.107351 |  Starts getting disrupted, lots of fouls.
[5199.40 - 5202.40] P:1845.51 E:0.111039 |  We can break it out. Have we had a yellow card yet, John?
[5202.40 - 5204.40] P:1899.80 E:0.103960 |  Yeah, we have. Bouffal.
[5205.40 - 5207.40] P:2008.41 E:0.105748 |  That's it.
[5207.40 - 5209.40] P:2025.92 E:0.117039 |  So Griezmann comes across to take this.
[5209.40 - 5211.40] P:2073.19 E:0.109889 |  Two-round is OK.
[5211.40 - 5213.40] P:2082.65 E:0.116663 |  There's no Giroud now in the middle,
[5213.40 - 5218.40] P:2032.74 E:0.117985 |  but Baran has wandered up and put himself right at the far side of the six-yard box.
[5218.40 - 5221.40] P:2047.11 E:0.114684 |  Bono is organising things.
[5221.40 - 5224.40] P:2033.45 E:0.123637 |  Absolutely gaining here with the whistles.
[5224.40 - 5226.40] P:1939.83 E:0.103994 |  In comes the free kick.
[5226.40 - 5228.40] P:1950.90 E:0.116236 |  Canate was after it.
[5228.40 - 5230.40] P:1935.88 E:0.122738 |  Bounces down for Kunde.
[5230.40 - 5233.40] P:1937.41 E:0.114904 |  Now to the right-hand side, and Bavéon to his left foot-shoot.
[5233.40 - 5235.40] P:1958.65 E:0.110317 |  Right-to-defender headed forward,
[5235.40 - 5238.40] P:1797.50 E:0.114101 |  but knotted away on the edge of the box by Eliamique,
[5238.40 - 5240.40] P:1759.84 E:0.100579 |  and the referee spotted.
[5240.40 - 5242.40] P:1683.93 E:0.105492 |  In fact, it's an offside flag on the far side,
[5242.40 - 5244.40] P:1687.93 E:0.109392 |  and it's a free kick to Morocco.
[5244.40 - 5246.40] P:1532.82 E:0.099532 |  Looked dangerous there when it opened up from Bavé.
[5246.40 - 5249.40] P:1562.53 E:0.105920 |  Oh, it did. It was a tremendous block.
[5249.40 - 5253.40] P:1694.03 E:0.111020 |  Kunde was initially looked like he was going to shoot right-hand side of the box
[5253.40 - 5256.40] P:1604.44 E:0.117509 |  from 25 yards, but shifted the ball and played it to him.
[5256.40 - 5259.40] P:1753.17 E:0.099084 |  Bavé, who I think was in an offside position,
[5259.40 - 5262.40] P:1910.77 E:0.105239 |  got the shot off, but crucial blocked.
[5262.40 - 5265.40] P:1936.14 E:0.117339 |  Coming forward again this time on the right-hand side.
[5265.40 - 5267.40] P:1843.92 E:0.118307 |  Dempéle, Dempéle though.
[5267.40 - 5271.40] P:1746.02 E:0.111340 |  Too much of it to Amala, and Amala was able to just nip it away from him,
[5271.40 - 5276.40] P:1585.84 E:0.100840 |  and Morocco have got it back on the edge of their own penalty area again.
[5276.40 - 5280.40] P:1487.17 E:0.106818 |  So, 1-0 for Frans Lied.
[5280.40 - 5282.40] P:1610.17 E:0.118577 |  20 minutes to go.
[5284.40 - 5290.40] P:1724.06 E:0.119882 |  Frans Lied has yet to keep a clean sheet at this World Cup.
[5290.40 - 5294.40] P:1586.35 E:0.121265 |  And Morocco have been knocking on the door.
[5294.40 - 5300.40] P:1741.63 E:0.111551 |  Here is Kandala just into the action, the substitute, the number nine.
[5300.40 - 5303.40] P:1944.97 E:0.120561 |  Touran, as the ball bounces away for Frans.
[5303.40 - 5306.40] P:1917.11 E:0.117194 |  Touran gets there first, and Touran is bundled over,
[5306.40 - 5309.40] P:1773.15 E:0.104606 |  shoved over by Dari. He got away from him,
[5309.40 - 5313.40] P:1814.95 E:0.099938 |  and Dari then trying to sort of check him, just shoved him over.
[5313.40 - 5316.40] P:1793.48 E:0.099802 |  And I'll be very surprised if that's not a yellow guard.
[5316.40 - 5319.40] P:1894.84 E:0.106263 |  It doesn't look that white.
[5319.40 - 5321.40] P:1805.31 E:0.093789 |  I think I might be very surprised.
[5321.40 - 5326.40] P:1859.86 E:0.099350 |  Dari was like a dormant throwing someone out of a nightclub there, wasn't he?
[5326.40 - 5331.40] P:1918.33 E:0.107790 |  Takes Touran down. I mean, that's ridiculous.
[5331.40 - 5333.40] P:1932.32 E:0.105063 |  How is it going to be?
[5333.40 - 5336.40] P:1977.55 E:0.110304 |  I'm officially very surprised.
[5336.40 - 5339.40] P:1982.99 E:0.116768 |  That is outrageous referee.
[5339.40 - 5342.40] P:2058.82 E:0.109623 |  Compared to some of the matches.
[5342.40 - 5346.40] P:2032.90 E:0.116977 |  Anyway, it's not a yellow card.
[5346.40 - 5348.40] P:1996.15 E:0.121934 |  It's a free kick down. This is a good position.
[5348.40 - 5352.40] P:2022.82 E:0.116783 |  And I've seen Driesman put balls in from this sort of area in this World Cup,
[5352.40 - 5356.40] P:2051.00 E:0.116935 |  which have caused real problems for teams.
[5356.40 - 5359.40] P:2014.58 E:0.116485 |  Driesman, wait, hands on his hips.
[5359.40 - 5361.40] P:2023.86 E:0.115598 |  He's looking at Bono's starting position.
[5361.40 - 5364.40] P:2075.89 E:0.116826 |  He needs to be a little bit careful.
[5364.40 - 5367.40] P:2038.92 E:0.118343 |  Driesman has the ball positioned.
[5367.40 - 5373.40] P:1995.95 E:0.120219 |  Yeah. Driesman is very pointedly looking across the box, not at the goal.
[5373.40 - 5376.40] P:2009.56 E:0.115692 |  Bono is standing well away from his near post.
[5376.40 - 5378.40] P:1971.44 E:0.120319 |  Driesman curls it into the back post.
[5378.40 - 5381.40] P:1777.82 E:0.102932 |  It's headed down beyond that far post.
[5384.40 - 5386.40] P:1658.18 E:0.111626 |  Looks as though it was.
[5388.40 - 5392.40] P:1706.14 E:0.119887 |  Touran, yeah, what a ball from Driesman.
[5392.40 - 5395.40] P:1788.19 E:0.111816 |  Left footed, lovely left foot.
[5395.40 - 5399.40] P:1769.56 E:0.105220 |  Lazy left foot just clipped beautifully to the far post.
[5399.40 - 5401.40] P:1744.49 E:0.101833 |  Touran gets up well.
[5401.40 - 5403.40] P:1607.44 E:0.087695 |  Doesn't hit the target.
[5403.40 - 5405.40] P:1628.48 E:0.076024 |  That's a chance.
[5405.40 - 5406.40] P:1662.13 E:0.110422 |  Big chance.
[5406.40 - 5409.40] P:1610.75 E:0.095418 |  Spoke about the French in the first half.
[5409.40 - 5411.40] P:1773.23 E:0.099497 |  Not taking the opportunities.
[5411.40 - 5414.40] P:1687.21 E:0.101974 |  Little Morocco and make them pay.
[5414.40 - 5419.40] P:1713.15 E:0.101656 |  France are still on track for the World Cup final.
[5419.40 - 5422.40] P:1785.06 E:0.096766 |  Second consecutive World Cup final.
[5422.40 - 5426.40] P:1820.96 E:0.101118 |  But this is a precarious lead that they've got now.
[5426.40 - 5433.40] P:1740.27 E:0.108761 |  They've had a better few moments after Morocco caused big problems early on in the second half.
[5433.40 - 5438.40] P:1957.59 E:0.115847 |  Driesman, I mean he's been brilliant against Amaric Driesman in so many areas of the field.
[5438.40 - 5442.40] P:1965.58 E:0.102402 |  And here he's won another three kick for his team ten yards inside the French half.
[5442.40 - 5445.40] P:1892.50 E:0.122812 |  He has been good.
[5445.40 - 5451.40] P:1902.13 E:0.097399 |  I just wonder whether the Moroccan substitutions at this moment in time
[5452.40 - 5458.40] P:2039.58 E:0.111910 |  and Della and Abu Clou haven't really made that much of an impact.
[5458.40 - 5464.40] P:2108.28 E:0.115638 |  Bouffal, looks like he was in pretty decent form in this second half.
[5464.40 - 5467.40] P:2069.76 E:0.109435 |  Of course the French back line some problems.
[5467.40 - 5472.40] P:2052.84 E:0.115185 |  So France won Morocco nil in this second World Cup semi-final.
[5472.40 - 5476.40] P:1917.22 E:0.112715 |  Something rather different tomorrow night in that we have commentary tomorrow night.
[5476.40 - 5480.40] P:1820.22 E:0.105149 |  This time tomorrow night on Rangers against Ebernian.
[5480.40 - 5487.40] P:1621.47 E:0.109435 |  In the premiership in Scotland as the premiership returns with Rangers under the new management of Michael Beale.
[5487.40 - 5491.40] P:1595.47 E:0.094835 |  So you'll hear that this time tomorrow on Five Live.
[5491.40 - 5496.40] P:1557.90 E:0.103299 |  France won nil up here as Amravak turns.
[5496.40 - 5498.40] P:1501.73 E:0.097781 |  Plays it to the left-hand side.
[5498.40 - 5500.40] P:1679.54 E:0.095322 |  Atchie Fala.
[5500.40 - 5504.40] P:1627.58 E:0.109870 |  Winner's throwing off Dembari.
[5504.40 - 5506.40] P:1618.09 E:0.115068 |  Just lost the way a little bit haven't they?
[5506.40 - 5508.40] P:1595.20 E:0.101834 |  Just five or so minutes.
[5508.40 - 5512.40] P:1581.75 E:0.102042 |  17 minutes of normal time left.
[5512.40 - 5516.40] P:1613.81 E:0.112248 |  You never know how long it's going to be played in extra time.
[5516.40 - 5520.40] P:1589.92 E:0.104756 |  But they create something.
[5520.40 - 5523.40] P:1623.24 E:0.110210 |  That momentum again.
[5523.40 - 5525.40] P:1746.83 E:0.121599 |  France win the ball back in the half-way line.
[5525.40 - 5529.40] P:2017.16 E:0.118462 |  Fafana is taking it forward and giving it to Turan.
[5529.40 - 5531.40] P:2056.02 E:0.118303 |  Morocco quickly back into position.
[5531.40 - 5532.40] P:1985.43 E:0.116554 |  Turan's working across.
[5532.40 - 5533.40] P:1951.34 E:0.113047 |  Still Fafana.
[5533.40 - 5538.40] P:1660.55 E:0.112697 |  Who shoots wildly wide inside the penalty area on the left-hand side.
[5538.40 - 5539.40] P:1655.50 E:0.117605 |  Black conviction really.
[5539.40 - 5540.40] P:1737.39 E:0.123523 |  Gold kick.
[5540.40 - 5542.40] P:1729.26 E:0.123259 |  Really weak effort.
[5542.40 - 5545.40] P:1661.79 E:0.119912 |  And we come Morocco, marauding forward.
[5545.40 - 5548.40] P:1724.27 E:0.111947 |  Yes with the special ball for the semi-finals.
[5548.40 - 5552.40] P:1709.14 E:0.114330 |  The golden ball and Morocco with Hakimi.
[5552.40 - 5555.40] P:1480.04 E:0.106014 |  Hakimi with support here from Unahi.
[5555.40 - 5558.40] P:1712.03 E:0.115680 |  And then again but Kanate steps in against the edge.
[5558.40 - 5559.40] P:1561.42 E:0.109053 |  Cross from Unahi.
[5559.40 - 5561.40] P:1739.69 E:0.110959 |  Big stretch from Peran.
[5561.40 - 5563.40] P:1716.28 E:0.110669 |  Hakimi did get there.
[5563.40 - 5564.40] P:1874.26 E:0.112846 |  Griezmann then.
[5564.40 - 5568.40] P:1900.09 E:0.113504 |  And the referee spotting infringement and giving a free kick against Morocco.
[5568.40 - 5570.40] P:1947.80 E:0.111565 |  That was for the challenge on Griezmann.
[5570.40 - 5573.40] P:1963.03 E:0.114016 |  Free kick just in front of the penalty area.
[5573.40 - 5578.40] P:2002.01 E:0.108412 |  So we've got just over 15 minutes to play.
[5578.40 - 5588.40] P:1965.33 E:0.119254 |  And Morocco are going to make what will be their fifth change of the 90 minutes.
[5588.40 - 5593.40] P:1978.12 E:0.119155 |  So preparing himself down there.
[5593.40 - 5596.40] P:1943.42 E:0.123201 |  On the edge of the coaching area.
[5596.40 - 5599.40] P:1927.10 E:0.114497 |  It's the exciting 20 year old.
[5599.40 - 5603.40] P:1948.73 E:0.118183 |  Esal Zuli who's winning the Barcelona man.
[5603.40 - 5606.40] P:1995.51 E:0.117011 |  On loan at Osasuna.
[5606.40 - 5611.40] P:2039.63 E:0.116982 |  And he's got the left arm of Waleed Reg Raggi.
[5611.40 - 5613.40] P:2017.82 E:0.117789 |  Round his shoulder.
[5613.40 - 5615.40] P:2007.20 E:0.115715 |  And next time the ball's out of play.
[5615.40 - 5617.40] P:2051.32 E:0.119379 |  Esal Zuli will be coming on.
[5617.40 - 5620.40] P:2025.85 E:0.117685 |  And France with it halfway inside their own heart.
[5620.40 - 5621.40] P:1951.47 E:0.119707 |  Or Trumane.
[5621.40 - 5623.40] P:1807.30 E:0.118313 |  He's in danger of losing possession he has.
[5623.40 - 5625.40] P:1768.60 E:0.121531 |  He's been robbed of the ball.
[5625.40 - 5627.40] P:1753.01 E:0.119935 |  And it's been taken on into the penalty area.
[5627.40 - 5630.40] P:1704.34 E:0.117236 |  By Hamdala who couldn't get the shot in.
[5630.40 - 5632.40] P:1692.25 E:0.111310 |  Ball still in play though.
[5632.40 - 5634.40] P:1683.67 E:0.109058 |  Cross from the left hand side from Aboukolo.
[5634.40 - 5638.40] P:1723.42 E:0.104829 |  That's blocked back to Atchatallah on the left hand side.
[5638.40 - 5640.40] P:1634.30 E:0.109861 |  Griezmann's gone there with him near the corner flag.
[5640.40 - 5641.40] P:1784.82 E:0.112732 |  Griezmann puts in the challenge.
[5641.40 - 5643.40] P:1927.33 E:0.116961 |  And then it bounces away.
[5643.40 - 5646.40] P:1933.98 E:0.122325 |  And Hamdala opened up from inside the penalty area.
[5646.40 - 5648.40] P:1985.25 E:0.111040 |  Couldn't get the shot on goal.
[5648.40 - 5650.40] P:1955.31 E:0.113186 |  Oh, hopeless for Hamdala.
[5650.40 - 5652.40] P:2014.94 E:0.113142 |  Had the opportunity to get a shot off.
[5652.40 - 5654.40] P:2005.41 E:0.114059 |  At least on a couple of occasions.
[5654.40 - 5656.40] P:2024.50 E:0.118006 |  Trying to walk the ball in.
[5656.40 - 5657.40] P:2119.87 E:0.111872 |  Opportunity gone.
[5657.40 - 5660.40] P:2085.67 E:0.116196 |  Are they going to get a better chance than that Morocco?
[5660.40 - 5662.40] P:2080.31 E:0.115595 |  Behrlust from Trumane.
[5662.40 - 5664.40] P:2025.57 E:0.120572 |  Or Weldon Morocco probably we should say.
[5664.40 - 5667.40] P:2014.34 E:0.117627 |  For dispossessing him 30 yards from his own goal.
[5667.40 - 5670.40] P:1991.62 E:0.118581 |  The noise inside this place.
[5670.40 - 5672.40] P:1955.51 E:0.124333 |  I think I'm going to be hearing this whistling
[5672.40 - 5675.40] P:1990.96 E:0.118668 |  until the World Cup final on Sunday afternoon.
[5675.40 - 5679.40] P:1826.44 E:0.125573 |  Can you just imagine seeing what it's like inside this stadium.
[5679.40 - 5681.40] P:1826.25 E:0.119973 |  What it's like back in Morocco.
[5681.40 - 5683.40] P:1836.14 E:0.121923 |  The first World Cup semi-final.
[5683.40 - 5685.40] P:1811.42 E:0.121600 |  Desperate for their team to come up with this goal.
[5685.40 - 5687.40] P:1729.49 E:0.109291 |  Maybe take it a little extra time.
[5687.40 - 5689.40] P:1472.90 E:0.109588 |  And then see what happens.
[5689.40 - 5693.40] P:1439.51 E:0.106862 |  Whether they're in Casablanca or Rabat.
[5693.40 - 5694.40] P:1563.32 E:0.114121 |  Or Fez.
[5694.40 - 5697.40] P:1313.11 E:0.114728 |  Or wherever it happens to be.
[5697.40 - 5699.40] P:1573.62 E:0.108544 |  Have you been to Morocco?
[5699.40 - 5701.40] P:1334.21 E:0.118430 |  No, never been to Morocco.
[5701.40 - 5704.40] P:1681.41 E:0.110651 |  I haven't been one of your destinations.
[5704.40 - 5708.40] P:1659.63 E:0.112013 |  So it is the Moroccans bringing it forward.
[5708.40 - 5710.40] P:1602.18 E:0.112832 |  Up to the half way line.
[5710.40 - 5714.40] P:1581.31 E:0.107431 |  Unahi, as Julian said, the keeper been reporting today
[5714.40 - 5717.40] P:1629.36 E:0.106020 |  that a strong interest from Leicester City.
[5717.40 - 5720.40] P:1582.03 E:0.100319 |  In Asdeen, Unahi.
[5720.40 - 5723.40] P:1545.32 E:0.105214 |  The Moroccan midfielder.
[5723.40 - 5725.40] P:1650.84 E:0.118911 |  I'd like the look of him throughout this tournament.
[5725.40 - 5727.40] P:1610.53 E:0.107135 |  Can handle the ball.
[5727.40 - 5729.40] P:1599.28 E:0.106608 |  Not the good dribbler.
[5729.40 - 5732.40] P:1672.01 E:0.110254 |  And the bat plays it out to the left hand side.
[5732.40 - 5735.40] P:1569.60 E:0.101035 |  Dancers in field, incidentally.
[5735.40 - 5738.40] P:1397.69 E:0.106865 |  As Alzuli is still waiting to come on.
[5738.40 - 5740.40] P:1557.59 E:0.115299 |  And the side of the pitch.
[5740.40 - 5743.40] P:1701.91 E:0.113744 |  Adjiaj Alat, down the left hand side.
[5743.40 - 5746.40] P:1710.50 E:0.116466 |  Hamd Alat is on to this.
[5746.40 - 5748.40] P:1626.98 E:0.124284 |  Inside the penalty area, it works the ball across.
[5748.40 - 5750.40] P:1669.98 E:0.112086 |  But that's going nowhere.
[5750.40 - 5753.40] P:1659.62 E:0.106697 |  It just stabs it straight behind into the outside net.
[5753.40 - 5755.40] P:1704.96 E:0.100887 |  And here's the change.
[5755.40 - 5759.40] P:1656.37 E:0.101249 |  And it will be the substitute who's being substituted.
[5759.40 - 5762.40] P:1738.95 E:0.092857 |  The first man who came on.
[5765.40 - 5768.40] P:1782.81 E:0.119546 |  Amala, who is making way.
[5768.40 - 5771.40] P:1828.85 E:0.104856 |  So this was early on in the match, 20 minutes,
[5771.40 - 5774.40] P:1809.62 E:0.105986 |  when Saiz had to go off and they brought on the midfielder.
[5774.40 - 5777.40] P:1780.96 E:0.110757 |  And now he's making way for the number 16,
[5777.40 - 5782.40] P:1660.71 E:0.106671 |  who is 21 on Saturday, the day before the World Cup final.
[5782.40 - 5784.40] P:1675.88 E:0.097954 |  The wing-out.
[5784.40 - 5788.40] P:1568.60 E:0.100681 |  Who is Spanish.
[5788.40 - 5795.40] P:1534.04 E:0.107934 |  And he is taking a position on the left hand side.
[5795.40 - 5799.40] P:1605.41 E:0.100129 |  But also, Fran's making a change with Dembele coming off.
[5799.40 - 5803.40] P:1898.85 E:0.099031 |  Who's not had a huge influence on the game tonight.
[5803.40 - 5805.40] P:1988.34 E:0.111479 |  Dembele.
[5805.40 - 5811.40] P:1964.04 E:0.103323 |  And replacing him is Kolo Muani of Eintracht Frankfurt.
[5811.40 - 5817.40] P:1913.70 E:0.110158 |  The number 12, who will go across to take up the ball.
[5817.40 - 5823.40] P:1965.86 E:0.104970 |  To take up the position that Dembele was playing in.
[5823.40 - 5830.40] P:1819.89 E:0.099032 |  So we've got, what, 11 minutes plus added time to play.
[5830.40 - 5833.40] P:1744.17 E:0.104689 |  Argentina coasted through really last night,
[5833.40 - 5835.40] P:1876.63 E:0.104489 |  getting the two early goals.
[5835.40 - 5838.40] P:2003.25 E:0.112855 |  But tonight, Fran's having got one early goal themselves,
[5838.40 - 5841.40] P:2001.85 E:0.115861 |  had had to really work for it, the final up, bring it forward.
[5841.40 - 5845.40] P:1977.18 E:0.115301 |  Here's Mbappe. Mbappe turns, gives it to Turan.
[5845.40 - 5847.40] P:2028.63 E:0.113419 |  Packed, panneled the area, back to Mbappe.
[5847.40 - 5849.40] P:1987.94 E:0.114963 |  Oh, beat Mbappe. Brilliant, full work.
[5849.40 - 5853.40] P:1919.58 E:0.116147 |  Still going, it's squirmed across, and then it's put into the net.
[5853.40 - 5855.40] P:1831.77 E:0.117886 |  It's the second goal for Fran's.
[5855.40 - 5860.40] P:1791.18 E:0.118518 |  And it's Muani, who's just come on, who just popped it in
[5860.40 - 5862.40] P:1739.85 E:0.115427 |  from a couple of yards out.
[5862.40 - 5867.40] P:1649.12 E:0.115232 |  That could well have broken Moroccan hearts here in the semi-final.
[5867.40 - 5869.40] P:1632.18 E:0.121736 |  Almost his first touch.
[5869.40 - 5872.40] P:1516.76 E:0.121406 |  Might well have been his first touch in the semi-final.
[5872.40 - 5876.40] P:1522.82 E:0.119340 |  And Fran's now lead Morocco by two goalers to nil.
[5876.40 - 5881.40] P:1617.19 E:0.108965 |  And it looks like they are bound for the final, but it's been tough.
[5881.40 - 5884.40] P:1716.92 E:0.117585 |  I think it was Muani's first touch.
[5884.40 - 5890.40] P:1664.74 E:0.110421 |  It was a really careless passing that fell out of the park from Morocco.
[5890.40 - 5897.40] P:1613.01 E:0.121342 |  And then Fran's just break the balls, popped out to Mbappe, left-hand side.
[5897.40 - 5900.40] P:1585.91 E:0.123647 |  He feeds the ball forward to Turan, who pops the ball back,
[5900.40 - 5904.40] P:1641.59 E:0.117551 |  and he jinxed inside the Moroccan defenders,
[5904.40 - 5906.40] P:1813.40 E:0.114322 |  tries to feed a shot into the far corner.
[5906.40 - 5911.40] P:1653.74 E:0.109451 |  It takes a deflection and falls perfectly.
[5911.40 - 5914.40] P:1731.93 E:0.120529 |  Muani, he can't miss two yards.
[5914.40 - 5916.40] P:1526.74 E:0.106647 |  That's pretty much game over.
[5916.40 - 5919.40] P:1696.63 E:0.097833 |  Brilliant feet from Mbappe.
[5919.40 - 5924.40] P:1680.11 E:0.105739 |  Drives inside, and Mbappe is always trying to get the ball on that right foot
[5924.40 - 5926.40] P:1606.49 E:0.097607 |  and find the far corner.
[5926.40 - 5929.40] P:1688.88 E:0.108336 |  And France get the break they needed.
[5929.40 - 5932.40] P:1608.11 E:0.105607 |  That deflection, Disharp off the bench, he's happy.
[5932.40 - 5935.40] P:1529.57 E:0.115985 |  He knows.
[5935.40 - 5939.40] P:1546.08 E:0.117056 |  But that's more than likely game over.
[5941.40 - 5947.40] P:1435.49 E:0.114829 |  Fran's two Morocco nil, and it would appear that Morocco's first appearance
[5947.40 - 5953.40] P:1679.84 E:0.109938 |  in a World Cup semi-final, the first African team to play in a World Cup semi-final.
[5953.40 - 5958.40] P:1633.77 E:0.106909 |  But it will go no further, and it'll be the third-place playoff against Croatia
[5958.40 - 5961.40] P:1522.78 E:0.094619 |  on Saturday afternoon that Morocco will play next.
[5961.40 - 5966.40] P:1582.68 E:0.101187 |  And also, this would be the first defeat under their new coach,
[5966.40 - 5973.40] P:1573.24 E:0.104930 |  Walid Regregi, in his 105th day in charge.
[5973.40 - 5975.40] P:1684.67 E:0.114119 |  Amazing story.
[5975.40 - 5977.40] P:1706.15 E:0.113922 |  Morocco not finished yet, though.
[5977.40 - 5982.40] P:1615.91 E:0.102088 |  Ball on the edge of the penalty area, but it's turned and cleared away by Turanini.
[5982.40 - 5987.40] P:1544.19 E:0.117222 |  Now this is going to take something phenomenal now for Morocco
[5987.40 - 5991.40] P:1596.36 E:0.103983 |  to take this beyond the 90 minutes and added time.
[5991.40 - 5995.40] P:1764.19 E:0.115270 |  Griezmann on the stretch, he's been fouled and it's a free kick to France.
[5995.40 - 5998.40] P:1934.25 E:0.104198 |  15 yards inside their own half.
[5998.40 - 6005.40] P:1861.66 E:0.096484 |  So, Colo Mouane, his first goal for France, comes in a World Cup semi-final
[6005.40 - 6007.40] P:1854.62 E:0.095020 |  and probably the clincher.
[6007.40 - 6010.40] P:1874.35 E:0.114993 |  He couldn't believe his luck, really,
[6010.40 - 6014.40] P:1917.21 E:0.105683 |  because the build-up play was down that left-hand side, wasn't it?
[6014.40 - 6021.40] P:1969.79 E:0.114183 |  And then watching Mbappe jink on the inside, he gets his shot off.
[6021.40 - 6026.40] P:1966.63 E:0.113688 |  He couldn't have fallen any more perfectly for it.
[6026.40 - 6031.40] P:1927.75 E:0.116105 |  Mbappe is on to this ball that was headed into his path by Hikimi
[6031.40 - 6034.40] P:1985.25 E:0.117211 |  and the two of them, the two friends from Paris Saint-Germain,
[6034.40 - 6037.40] P:1962.31 E:0.117464 |  are now tussling for it in the full-back position.
[6037.40 - 6040.40] P:1900.90 E:0.113992 |  And now, France go back towards the half-player line.
[6040.40 - 6044.40] P:2005.16 E:0.113943 |  To go back to Mouane, to say, playing for Eintracht Frankfurt,
[6044.40 - 6048.40] P:2004.31 E:0.114818 |  having been signed from Nantes last summer.
[6048.40 - 6053.40] P:1967.66 E:0.114962 |  It's quite a story, first called up in September.
[6053.40 - 6059.40] P:1962.15 E:0.119448 |  So, it wasn't even in this squad until Christopher Nkunku picked up that injury,
[6059.40 - 6063.40] P:1852.05 E:0.114301 |  so a late replacement, played against Tunisia.
[6063.40 - 6066.40] P:1830.07 E:0.112348 |  It was a substitute in the semi-finals
[6066.40 - 6071.40] P:1719.92 E:0.105841 |  and perhaps scored the goal that has clinched it for Didier Deschants' team.
[6071.40 - 6076.40] P:1642.27 E:0.107245 |  We forget, don't we, about all the injuries that France had before this competition.
[6076.40 - 6079.40] P:1614.89 E:0.107509 |  Not a big hit, there's high-profile players out, we know.
[6079.40 - 6082.40] P:1611.47 E:0.095744 |  Benzema, of course.
[6082.40 - 6088.40] P:1655.72 E:0.104811 |  Kante, Pogba, Kempemba, Nkunku, Los Ravio.
[6088.40 - 6092.40] P:1556.16 E:0.107905 |  They still have strength and depth.
[6092.40 - 6097.40] P:1687.72 E:0.110652 |  We're getting the golden ball, the Ballon d'Orviner himself as well, Benzema,
[6097.40 - 6099.40] P:1603.32 E:0.108378 |  who was in the squad.
[6099.40 - 6103.40] P:1717.33 E:0.106101 |  And Amra back now with a crossfield pass that he's got wrong.
[6103.40 - 6106.40] P:1636.84 E:0.102151 |  He slaps his hands together in frustration.
[6106.40 - 6108.40] P:1564.00 E:0.114925 |  They've lost the way, though.
[6108.40 - 6114.40] P:1629.21 E:0.107764 |  I think the substitutions from Morocco actually have disrupted their rhythm.
[6114.40 - 6119.40] P:1636.69 E:0.104314 |  I thought they started the second half absolutely superbly.
[6119.40 - 6121.40] P:1587.04 E:0.109836 |  You can understand in many respects,
[6121.40 - 6125.40] P:1592.54 E:0.107898 |  the draggy, the gamble which he felt he needed to take.
[6125.40 - 6128.40] P:1744.24 E:0.109677 |  It has to be a foul.
[6128.40 - 6134.40] P:1709.73 E:0.110564 |  It's given against Kante, who seemed to be initially wrestled, then wrestled back,
[6134.40 - 6137.40] P:1688.78 E:0.108466 |  and it's been given Morocco's way.
[6137.40 - 6140.40] P:1637.94 E:0.109496 |  They have to score from this, Morocco.
[6140.40 - 6145.40] P:1708.97 E:0.106054 |  Zeyesh has a lovely left foot, a luscious left foot.
[6145.40 - 6148.40] P:1812.83 E:0.117897 |  3-8, something from this.
[6148.40 - 6154.40] P:1758.64 E:0.109233 |  That's Chris Sutton with us on 5-5 BBC Sounds on the World Service as well across Africa.
[6154.40 - 6162.40] P:1712.78 E:0.110168 |  Africa will be hoping against hope that this Morocco team can pull something out of the back.
[6162.40 - 6164.40] P:1721.40 E:0.122251 |  There's scuffle in there.
[6164.40 - 6171.40] P:1732.91 E:0.112137 |  The thing that's happening is that there are just pushing and shoving on the edge of the French penalty area.
[6171.40 - 6174.40] P:1713.75 E:0.106082 |  The Rams actually being called out by the referee.
[6174.40 - 6176.40] P:1721.72 E:0.100809 |  That's the meek it is.
[6176.40 - 6180.40] P:1680.62 E:0.114665 |  He's lost his head a little bit there.
[6180.40 - 6185.40] P:1762.69 E:0.114275 |  18, El Yameek.
[6187.40 - 6190.40] P:1723.62 E:0.118124 |  So the referee's hoping to them.
[6190.40 - 6193.40] P:1661.90 E:0.119311 |  No, you're on cards obviously.
[6193.40 - 6198.40] P:1717.51 E:0.106645 |  And Zeyesh will take this free kick left footed from the right flank,
[6198.40 - 6202.40] P:1639.60 E:0.099691 |  and it goes, Griesman's underneath it and heads it back to where it came.
[6202.40 - 6208.40] P:1551.24 E:0.098192 |  Stretching header away from Gulskoor and Muani.
[6208.40 - 6211.40] P:1438.46 E:0.114738 |  Just the sort of opportunity that you want.
[6211.40 - 6215.40] P:1470.37 E:0.110998 |  Fell to him after the brilliant run from Abapay.
[6215.40 - 6218.40] P:1490.47 E:0.105781 |  I mean, there are assists and desists out there.
[6218.40 - 6220.40] P:1397.90 E:0.103300 |  But that was...
[6220.40 - 6224.40] P:1576.09 E:0.106662 |  Couldn't miss. The pace was taken off the ball.
[6224.40 - 6230.40] P:1537.74 E:0.112607 |  The Moroccan defender Abapay is an initial shot.
[6230.40 - 6232.40] P:1554.54 E:0.119248 |  What a moment for him.
[6232.40 - 6236.40] P:1579.58 E:0.099122 |  Just popping that one in. Pretty much game over.
[6236.40 - 6242.40] P:1578.62 E:0.106734 |  Red Raggy did liken this Moroccan team to Rocky Balboa.
[6242.40 - 6244.40] P:1725.84 E:0.098174 |  Yes, he did.
[6244.40 - 6249.40] P:1643.07 E:0.098818 |  Well, they're right on the ropes now.
[6249.40 - 6253.40] P:1542.99 E:0.107400 |  Still, they are coming forward with the ball over on the left-hand side.
[6253.40 - 6257.40] P:1495.68 E:0.112727 |  Abapay with the assist, but he hasn't got on the score sheet tonight.
[6257.40 - 6259.40] P:1619.20 E:0.113484 |  Cross comes over from the left-hand side.
[6259.40 - 6263.40] P:1622.92 E:0.115242 |  A stretching header actually just glances it right across to Zeyesh
[6263.40 - 6265.40] P:1657.61 E:0.111791 |  in the box here on the right-hand side.
[6265.40 - 6268.40] P:1656.25 E:0.113207 |  Zeyesh plays it between the legs of Turram,
[6268.40 - 6272.40] P:1709.52 E:0.120999 |  but it didn't get a touch-off in the next two minutes behind for a goal kick.
[6272.40 - 6273.40] P:1756.61 E:0.115210 |  And we've now gone.
[6273.40 - 6275.40] P:1742.72 E:0.111056 |  Well, just over four minutes plus added time to play
[6275.40 - 6279.40] P:1619.24 E:0.109845 |  before France confirm their plays in the world cup final.
[6279.40 - 6282.40] P:1685.20 E:0.114527 |  And we talked about the Moroccan substitution.
[6282.40 - 6285.40] P:1667.52 E:0.114727 |  It's not working. I think Turram has been a good substitution
[6285.40 - 6288.40] P:1642.11 E:0.113573 |  before Didier Deschamps on this left-hand side.
[6288.40 - 6291.40] P:1721.28 E:0.120290 |  Abapay's gone in as a central striker,
[6291.40 - 6294.40] P:1848.15 E:0.111919 |  but he's been a good outlet on the left,
[6294.40 - 6298.40] P:1931.48 E:0.115678 |  and he's defended well, actually tracks back something Abapay doesn't do.
[6300.40 - 6306.40] P:1911.33 E:0.116892 |  So, just as though we will get Messi and Abapay on opposite sides in the World Cup final,
[6306.40 - 6308.40] P:1806.47 E:0.116069 |  and also with Abapay not scoring tonight,
[6308.40 - 6311.40] P:1675.04 E:0.116875 |  level on five goals each in this tournament.
[6311.40 - 6313.40] P:1528.44 E:0.116426 |  Here is Zeyesh's trick.
[6313.40 - 6317.40] P:1695.49 E:0.108034 |  It was a foul. Yes, it was. Whoever said that down there.
[6317.40 - 6320.40] P:1646.25 E:0.102897 |  It's a free-kick, Zeyesh will have this.
[6320.40 - 6323.40] P:1495.86 E:0.117128 |  But Turram's holding onto the ball,
[6323.40 - 6326.40] P:1803.64 E:0.116490 |  so Andra back goes and tries to get it back from him.
[6326.40 - 6328.40] P:1903.89 E:0.118901 |  Is there going to be a card?
[6328.40 - 6329.40] P:1785.58 E:0.104680 |  No, that's not nice.
[6329.40 - 6331.40] P:1786.67 E:0.114793 |  Do you think he has a card in his pocket?
[6331.40 - 6335.40] P:1644.63 E:0.117443 |  No, unless he gave it to Buffal when he showed it to him in the first half.
[6335.40 - 6338.40] P:1683.87 E:0.112133 |  Here's Hakimi now, down the right.
[6338.40 - 6341.40] P:1569.39 E:0.121444 |  Hernandez holds him up. The ball was over the line.
[6341.40 - 6344.40] P:1790.39 E:0.112396 |  So, it's the assistant flagging.
[6344.40 - 6348.40] P:1909.95 E:0.111184 |  He doesn't like Hakimi, but it's a goal kick.
[6348.40 - 6353.40] P:1948.24 E:0.108927 |  And Hernandez has just shepherded him away.
[6353.40 - 6356.40] P:1948.31 E:0.112561 |  There'll be great disappointment, of course, for Morocco
[6356.40 - 6358.40] P:2021.02 E:0.115854 |  if they're not able to produce another miracle.
[6358.40 - 6362.40] P:1991.94 E:0.116802 |  It's already been a miracle what they've done here in the eyes of many.
[6362.40 - 6366.40] P:1965.38 E:0.117080 |  So, there'll be great disappointment that they haven't been able to take that final step.
[6366.40 - 6369.40] P:1988.41 E:0.113573 |  But I'm sure in the aftermath of that,
[6369.40 - 6371.40] P:1915.60 E:0.115383 |  we'll see some great scenes inside this ground
[6371.40 - 6373.40] P:1973.60 E:0.115346 |  for what they have been able to do.
[6373.40 - 6377.40] P:1902.19 E:0.122872 |  I'm sure Hakimi's mother will be involved again, won't she?
[6377.40 - 6381.40] P:1791.50 E:0.114770 |  Goal kick, downfield from Loris Hakimi,
[6381.40 - 6384.40] P:1576.52 E:0.119282 |  clicks it in field, Dari.
[6384.40 - 6389.40] P:1592.84 E:0.117827 |  Now Andra back with that shavon head,
[6389.40 - 6392.40] P:1499.07 E:0.107932 |  clicks it to his left,
[6392.40 - 6395.40] P:1617.42 E:0.119344 |  pass forward to Ajayatala.
[6395.40 - 6398.40] P:1776.69 E:0.124697 |  And then Griezmann steps in for the up-teens time.
[6398.40 - 6401.40] P:1925.90 E:0.122555 |  And Griezmann in the right place at the right time.
[6401.40 - 6404.40] P:1975.99 E:0.129509 |  And France have got possession back again.
[6404.40 - 6407.40] P:1885.26 E:0.105778 |  Two minutes of the 90 to go.
[6407.40 - 6412.40] P:1710.86 E:0.109138 |  And France are nearing with every second that passes by.
[6412.40 - 6415.40] P:1867.85 E:0.106813 |  A second consecutive World Cup final.
[6415.40 - 6421.40] P:1996.43 E:0.116008 |  Griezmann, Griezmann stabs it out to the right-hand side to Mouane.
[6421.40 - 6425.40] P:2088.82 E:0.112806 |  Mouane looks behind him, Kunde is there.
[6425.40 - 6430.40] P:2088.26 E:0.116949 |  Kunde uses two Mouane and France go back to the half-way line.
[6430.40 - 6435.40] P:1940.37 E:0.117340 |  Kunde does a steady job, doesn't he, in that French right-back position.
[6435.40 - 6437.40] P:1878.77 E:0.120207 |  He's not one to centre-up by trade.
[6437.40 - 6441.40] P:1928.89 E:0.112939 |  He's not wanting overlaps and gets forward.
[6441.40 - 6446.40] P:1996.42 E:0.113997 |  He plays as a back support.
[6446.40 - 6449.40] P:1813.07 E:0.125222 |  Dishonk not having Benjamin Pavard, really.
[6449.40 - 6451.40] P:1763.88 E:0.103482 |  No.
[6451.40 - 6453.40] P:1693.66 E:0.118505 |  This is all then to where, as Julian was telling us,
[6453.40 - 6456.40] P:1684.57 E:0.104115 |  as he mentioned a couple of times during the tournament,
[6456.40 - 6462.40] P:1599.25 E:0.105273 |  the fact that Dempéle prefers Kunde as the right-back who's playing behind him.
[6462.40 - 6465.40] P:1533.54 E:0.113323 |  I just wonder how Pavard would feel about that.
[6465.40 - 6469.40] P:1632.72 E:0.113249 |  It'd necessarily be delighted, wouldn't it, through Pavard.
[6469.40 - 6471.40] P:1542.54 E:0.108478 |  Two-nil, France lead.
[6471.40 - 6474.40] P:1533.50 E:0.113537 |  Here's Amre back, who plays it out towards the left-hand side.
[6474.40 - 6476.40] P:1554.71 E:0.105603 |  The France have dropped back into position.
[6476.40 - 6480.40] P:1499.94 E:0.106306 |  And are looking here for what would be their first clean sheet of this World Cup.
[6480.40 - 6483.40] P:1645.63 E:0.120741 |  It's played through into the penalty area and a shot from the angle.
[6483.40 - 6485.40] P:1620.06 E:0.112493 |  It's offside, though, it's gone early.
[6485.40 - 6488.40] P:1717.53 E:0.096900 |  The offside flag is up.
[6488.40 - 6495.40] P:1668.04 E:0.105370 |  Abu Clal just made the movement that French back four sitting really deep on the edge of their own box.
[6495.40 - 6499.40] P:1683.87 E:0.099610 |  But, I don't know, at the start of this second half,
[6499.40 - 6501.40] P:1652.63 E:0.101237 |  you felt it was going to happen, pull Morocco,
[6501.40 - 6508.40] P:1864.42 E:0.102387 |  but that French second goal has really knocked the stuffing and belief
[6508.40 - 6513.40] P:1943.64 E:0.111705 |  out of this Moroccan team who have performed so valiantly,
[6513.40 - 6518.40] P:1834.28 E:0.098376 |  so bravely throughout this competition.
[6518.40 - 6521.40] P:1731.42 E:0.111231 |  It's not going to happen for them this evening.
[6521.40 - 6523.40] P:1691.31 E:0.116413 |  Morocco still come forward.
[6523.40 - 6528.40] P:1830.90 E:0.108127 |  Ziaz, a bit Hernandez with a little shove on Ziaz.
[6528.40 - 6531.40] P:1786.83 E:0.104958 |  Make sure the ball rolls over the white line and it's a throw into the French.
[6531.40 - 6536.40] P:1589.65 E:0.100278 |  And we've got six minutes of added time, so technically, plenty of time to score a couple of goals,
[6536.40 - 6541.40] P:1552.32 E:0.105076 |  but I'm afraid the body language watching from here inside the stadium,
[6541.40 - 6543.40] P:1663.73 E:0.110863 |  the body language tells you otherwise.
[6543.40 - 6551.40] P:1892.50 E:0.105212 |  So it's going to be a fourth World Cup final for France after Paris in 98 memorably, their own World Cup.
[6551.40 - 6556.40] P:1858.24 E:0.105599 |  And then Berlin in 2006, the defeat on penalties against Italy,
[6556.40 - 6564.40] P:1829.48 E:0.096162 |  Zinedine Zidane and all that, and then four years ago in Moscow against Croatia and that entertaining final.
[6564.40 - 6568.40] P:1772.89 E:0.104330 |  There's everything to suggest that on Sunday Argentina against France,
[6568.40 - 6574.40] P:1684.11 E:0.097926 |  and that is a really, that's a, it's been a strange World Cup, an odd experience,
[6574.40 - 6576.40] P:1481.39 E:0.089868 |  but that's a proper World Cup final.
[6576.40 - 6581.40] P:1523.93 E:0.102214 |  However, let's talk about that later because Morocco are still coming forward.
[6581.40 - 6583.40] P:1751.58 E:0.109084 |  They've not given this up yet.
[6583.40 - 6587.40] P:1616.91 E:0.101089 |  Atiatala on the left can't get there and it's out of play and it's a throw into France.
[6587.40 - 6590.40] P:1765.00 E:0.107278 |  They've just, they've just really lacked that quality.
[6593.40 - 6601.40] P:1896.42 E:0.111940 |  Important pass in the final third, and you, even the great Moroccan fans in this stadium tonight seem to have lost a bit of heart.
[6601.40 - 6605.40] P:1872.29 E:0.098970 |  We can hear the French fans' voices.
[6606.40 - 6610.40] P:1841.79 E:0.105897 |  Oh, that's bounced off, Hakimi, and it's bounced four fans.
[6610.40 - 6612.40] P:1891.87 E:0.095355 |  Two around.
[6612.40 - 6615.40] P:1880.12 E:0.109623 |  Oh, lovely from Mbappe, beats Angra back.
[6615.40 - 6618.40] P:1892.39 E:0.116114 |  Now Mbappe up to the edge of the penalty area, burst into the box,
[6618.40 - 6623.40] P:1846.27 E:0.114559 |  oh, excellent challenge from Hakimi against his Paris Saint-Germain friend.
[6623.40 - 6630.40] P:1675.99 E:0.104866 |  He went to ground and he ripped the ball off the toe of Mbappe inside the Moroccan penalty area.
[6630.40 - 6631.40] P:1744.53 E:0.104003 |  Well done, Hakimi.
[6631.40 - 6638.40] P:1661.43 E:0.106864 |  Now that's been a really intriguing contest, has a head-to-head two team-mates, little nutmeg on Amreback middle of the pitch,
[6638.40 - 6640.40] P:1654.79 E:0.108534 |  and he drives the box, tries to knock it round.
[6640.40 - 6643.40] P:1619.26 E:0.094657 |  Hakimi, he drew his credit, gets back.
[6647.40 - 6652.40] P:1598.27 E:0.093128 |  France clearing through Hernan Gatz into the Moroccan half-boats,
[6652.40 - 6657.40] P:1785.06 E:0.104235 |  chested down by Dari, and now Amreback.
[6657.40 - 6662.40] P:1736.79 E:0.103505 |  He's been involved in some tussles with Mbappe as well here tonight.
[6662.40 - 6666.40] P:1601.29 E:0.095347 |  Great memories, but it's going to be a losing experience, I think.
[6666.40 - 6670.40] P:1456.71 E:0.107175 |  Zier Chonli on the right in the full-back position, Zier.
[6670.40 - 6674.40] P:1622.11 E:0.112160 |  There's it back, Amreback, Amreback's cross towards the penalty spot,
[6674.40 - 6678.40] P:1445.92 E:0.109742 |  comes off Driesmann's head, and he's got a good shot.
[6678.40 - 6682.40] P:1549.84 E:0.114494 |  Amreback, Amreback's cross towards the penalty spot, comes off Driesmann's head,
[6682.40 - 6687.40] P:1667.56 E:0.110041 |  bounces down for the shot from Abouklou, and then bounces away to the edge of the penalty area,
[6687.40 - 6692.40] P:1696.42 E:0.107897 |  who now he turns and shoots, but it's taken a flick off the defender, off Fafana,
[6692.40 - 6694.40] P:1640.27 E:0.103517 |  and it's a corner to Morocco from the right.
[6694.40 - 6700.40] P:1603.26 E:0.105162 |  Yeah, was that Driesmann back, making the block, water block, inside his own box.
[6700.40 - 6704.40] P:1591.57 E:0.108444 |  French two up, we're in the texts for a time, but that was crucial.
[6704.40 - 6708.40] P:1559.92 E:0.106987 |  The corner is taken, Amreback gets it, close it in, it's headed down and away,
[6708.40 - 6713.40] P:1789.72 E:0.112320 |  and now here with a shot that's blocked also by a French body inside the penalty area.
[6713.40 - 6717.40] P:1927.27 E:0.113204 |  Canate, I think it was, and France have been able to clear it away downfield
[6717.40 - 6723.40] P:1695.94 E:0.104810 |  where it's headed back to Bono, and the goalkeeper gets the ball under control,
[6723.40 - 6732.40] P:1749.19 E:0.113459 |  and gives it to the substitute, as Alzouli, still going as Alzouli into the penalty area,
[6732.40 - 6735.40] P:1780.74 E:0.116862 |  still going as well, up towards the Lories, and then cleared out,
[6735.40 - 6741.40] P:1768.84 E:0.116292 |  but this could be a chance for the goal that's deflected across the box, and then in the six yard box,
[6741.40 - 6747.40] P:1696.09 E:0.110832 |  Hamdalla couldn't force it over the line, blocked by Lories, and that French goal escapes again.
[6747.40 - 6753.40] P:1641.36 E:0.112807 |  Oh, how lucky were the French then, what a run on the left hand side.
[6753.40 - 6759.40] P:1712.61 E:0.111303 |  As Azouli just kept driving, picked the ball up on the halfway line,
[6759.40 - 6764.40] P:1668.88 E:0.112005 |  and kept going and going, gets to the bar line, pulls it back, and there's a massive scramble.
[6764.40 - 6767.40] P:1558.38 E:0.098968 |  Looks like the ball is going in.
[6767.40 - 6770.40] P:1468.82 E:0.112002 |  Is it Cundi on the line?
[6770.40 - 6772.40] P:1522.94 E:0.102719 |  Good question.
[6772.40 - 6774.40] P:1650.56 E:0.118271 |  It was, didn't know anything about it.
[6774.40 - 6778.40] P:1566.56 E:0.110191 |  Morocco again, the ball over the top, Faran gets in to make the header,
[6778.40 - 6781.40] P:1714.49 E:0.114452 |  and the whistle's gone, the upside flag has come up as well,
[6781.40 - 6785.40] P:1686.35 E:0.108047 |  whether the danger there was from the high foot also, but it's a free kick to the French,
[6785.40 - 6790.40] P:1713.42 E:0.103856 |  and high fives all round, and it is still 2-0 to the French.
[6790.40 - 6795.40] P:1849.65 E:0.105056 |  Yeah, it's just not their night in the Rockins.
[6795.40 - 6804.40] P:1834.76 E:0.117789 |  There's a strike which comes in as Hamdalla's knee, and it is Cundi on the line.
[6804.40 - 6810.40] P:1744.63 E:0.119446 |  Who knows absolutely nothing about that.
[6810.40 - 6817.40] P:1715.46 E:0.118193 |  Didier Deschamps, it's his night, it's the French team's night, and stuff like that happens.
[6817.40 - 6822.40] P:1698.92 E:0.119031 |  And this now, this is mutual appreciation going on here inside the ground.
[6822.40 - 6825.40] P:1663.31 E:0.118965 |  The French ticklers are waiting to our left, and they're in joyous mood,
[6825.40 - 6832.40] P:1634.33 E:0.115120 |  preparing for another World Cup final, but the Moroccan fans are giving a big thank you to this team.
[6832.40 - 6836.40] P:1524.07 E:0.114124 |  They're applauding, they're singing, and notice as well on the bench down there,
[6836.40 - 6842.40] P:1555.45 E:0.110391 |  many of the coaches have actually just got up and applauded the crowd as well for what they did just then.
[6842.40 - 6847.40] P:1637.39 E:0.105376 |  They know the game is up, but what a game it's been.
[6847.40 - 6853.40] P:1684.35 E:0.107388 |  We've got a well into added time now, we're in the final minute of added time,
[6853.40 - 6861.40] P:1692.41 E:0.113676 |  and Morocco with Amrabat, falls all back, wins the concede to the free kick,
[6861.40 - 6864.40] P:1614.42 E:0.111405 |  so France will have this free kick.
[6864.40 - 6867.40] P:1680.15 E:0.113751 |  Romain, he looks towards the referee.
[6867.40 - 6871.40] P:1711.01 E:0.121684 |  Well what a contest it's been.
[6871.40 - 6875.40] P:1675.54 E:0.120225 |  Certainly not, whereas people might look at the score line when they see it tonight or in the morning,
[6875.40 - 6879.40] P:1661.61 E:0.119204 |  and think well 2-0, 2-0, France got through, it must have been easy enough,
[6879.40 - 6882.40] P:1748.91 E:0.117117 |  and there is the final whistle, but that's not been the case.
[6882.40 - 6887.40] P:1713.07 E:0.115276 |  And the French celebrations there, the substitutes coming, running on,
[6887.40 - 6890.40] P:1629.57 E:0.117687 |  but the Moroccan players drop to the turf.
[6890.40 - 6896.40] P:1654.01 E:0.114384 |  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of them, 8 of them now flat on the ground.
[6896.40 - 6900.40] P:1570.94 E:0.113976 |  The effort that they've put in here tonight.
[6900.40 - 6904.40] P:1576.53 E:0.114444 |  World Cup semi-final, it was all on the line.
[6904.40 - 6907.40] P:1565.74 E:0.110522 |  France have won it with the early goal from Theo Hernandez,
[6907.40 - 6911.40] P:1541.33 E:0.114126 |  and then the clincher from the substitute Kolo Muani.
[6911.40 - 6916.40] P:1547.61 E:0.113115 |  What a night for Morocco, what a night, great story.
[6916.40 - 6919.40] P:1547.39 E:0.107323 |  It is still the same old story.
[6919.40 - 6924.40] P:1571.52 E:0.103826 |  The fundamental things apply, and France are through,
[6924.40 - 6927.40] P:1552.26 E:0.102941 |  but Morocco, you just have to praise them.
[6927.40 - 6931.40] P:1495.67 E:0.102938 |  What a tournament, what a World Cup, a semi-final.
[6931.40 - 6935.40] P:1485.43 E:0.105826 |  They'll have the third place play-off on Saturday against Croatia,
[6935.40 - 6939.40] P:1546.32 E:0.102525 |  but what they've done under that coach, Wally Regragi,
[6939.40 - 6944.40] P:1478.98 E:0.102532 |  I mean he will go down in Moroccan folklore
[6944.40 - 6947.40] P:1532.96 E:0.108050 |  for what this team has done at this World Cup in Qatar.
[6947.40 - 6950.40] P:1495.28 E:0.107266 |  But that's it, there'll be no final for them,
[6950.40 - 6953.40] P:1501.34 E:0.115032 |  and France are through to a second successive World Cup final.
[6953.40 - 6957.40] P:1537.53 E:0.094360 |  The holders against Argentina, Chris Sutton.
[6957.40 - 6962.40] P:1570.13 E:0.108343 |  Absolutely a feel for Morocco, the story of this World Cup.
[6962.40 - 6965.40] P:1710.54 E:0.113452 |  For me, just came up a little bit short tonight,
[6965.40 - 6970.40] P:1648.86 E:0.109492 |  depleted with injuries, you know, players cobbled together to go out
[6970.40 - 6973.40] P:1613.42 E:0.103793 |  and try and perform this evening.
[6973.40 - 6978.40] P:1752.33 E:0.105212 |  Masrawi came off, Zeiss came off, Agurd, before kick-off,
[6978.40 - 6981.40] P:1734.76 E:0.110393 |  I believe he was going to start,
[6981.40 - 6984.40] P:1659.20 E:0.109259 |  and I think the substitution, the second half disrupted them,
[6984.40 - 6987.40] P:1726.24 E:0.107253 |  but they can be proud of this World Cup, their displays,
[6987.40 - 6992.40] P:1715.73 E:0.103899 |  taking the scalps of Belgium, Spain, Portugal,
[6992.40 - 6997.40] P:1744.90 E:0.111920 |  shocking the world really, but tonight there was France,
[6997.40 - 7000.40] P:1800.60 E:0.109975 |  the World Champions, and I don't know, they're a strange team, France.
[7000.40 - 7004.40] P:1731.46 E:0.108736 |  They didn't play with great flair, but they got the job done,
[7004.40 - 7007.40] P:1602.27 E:0.110280 |  didn't they, once again, World Cup final,
[7007.40 - 7011.40] P:1693.25 E:0.104295 |  could be back-to-back, my tips for the tournament, Mark Chapman laughed at me.
[7011.40 - 7013.40] P:1718.94 E:0.106497 |  I was brave, I stuck my neck out on the line,
[7013.40 - 7017.40] P:1604.47 E:0.104027 |  and I went for France again, because I hadn't been done for 60 years,
[7017.40 - 7023.40] P:1619.60 E:0.096200 |  I don't think, but there you go, and they're still my tips, Mark Chapman.
[7023.40 - 7025.40] P:1557.77 E:0.122016 |  I mean, this isn't the point at this stage,
[7025.40 - 7028.40] P:1622.79 E:0.109051 |  but let's just clarify, I didn't laugh at you for tipping France,
[7028.40 - 7032.40] P:1547.00 E:0.107685 |  I laughed at you for you suggesting that France were your outside tip,
[7032.40 - 7035.40] P:1483.70 E:0.107173 |  because everybody was going for the obvious.
[7035.40 - 7039.40] P:1448.41 E:0.111023 |  That was what I was laughing at.
[7039.40 - 7045.40] P:1527.03 E:0.110755 |  These are really, really special scenes here at the moment.
[7045.40 - 7051.40] P:1596.24 E:0.102203 |  I've watched Hakimi, like all the Moroccan players,
[7051.40 - 7055.40] P:1514.36 E:0.099051 |  just fell to the turf at the end and lay on his back,
[7055.40 - 7060.40] P:1559.93 E:0.110517 |  and the first player to come up to him was his best mate, Kylian Mbappe,
[7060.40 - 7066.40] P:1561.58 E:0.105768 |  who dragged him up off the turf and hugged him, and hugged him, and hugged him,
[7066.40 - 7070.40] P:1586.43 E:0.110547 |  and then went off to Kibisra with some of the other Moroccan players,
[7070.40 - 7073.40] P:1575.94 E:0.112613 |  and Hakimi went back down at that stage,
[7073.40 - 7078.40] P:1618.64 E:0.111399 |  and then Griezmann came up and dragged Hakimi off the turf and hugged him.
[7078.40 - 7083.40] P:1540.92 E:0.110667 |  And then Mbappe has now come back to tour to Hakimi,
[7083.40 - 7089.40] P:1524.69 E:0.108278 |  and right now at the end, they swap shirts and embrace,
[7089.40 - 7094.40] P:1512.44 E:0.113805 |  and Hakimi goes off to join the huddle of the Moroccan players in the centre circle,
[7094.40 - 7097.40] P:1578.15 E:0.111417 |  and then Mbappe goes off to join his French teammate,
[7097.40 - 7102.40] P:1472.30 E:0.111138 |  who are about to launch themselves towards the French fans.
[7102.40 - 7105.40] P:1520.12 E:0.117475 |  All of them in blue shirts,
[7105.40 - 7110.40] P:1617.52 E:0.113393 |  and then Mbappe, who has on a red Moroccan Hakimi shirt,
[7110.40 - 7115.40] P:1778.31 E:0.110709 |  and that's happening to our left, and our way to our right,
[7115.40 - 7120.40] P:1834.39 E:0.108710 |  where all the Moroccan fans are, they haven't gone.
[7120.40 - 7124.40] P:1686.62 E:0.118873 |  They are waiting for their players, who are at the moment being addressed
[7124.40 - 7127.40] P:1583.61 E:0.106274 |  by their head coach, Walid Ragraghi.
[7127.40 - 7131.40] P:1627.64 E:0.107792 |  They are waiting for those players to move towards them,
[7131.40 - 7134.40] P:1650.27 E:0.123675 |  and Ragraghi just finished talking to the players,
[7134.40 - 7136.40] P:1743.08 E:0.109833 |  and then pointed to the Moroccan fans,
[7136.40 - 7143.40] P:1761.34 E:0.116339 |  and you can hear now the cheers that are coming from those fans,
[7143.40 - 7147.40] P:1718.97 E:0.111618 |  as those players move towards them.
[7147.40 - 7151.40] P:1639.35 E:0.118636 |  One team has won here tonight, and one team has lost,
[7151.40 - 7155.40] P:1562.24 E:0.111377 |  and yet everybody who is in this stadium is on their feet,
[7155.40 - 7157.40] P:1624.15 E:0.118645 |  applauding all the players.
[7157.40 - 7161.40] P:1587.59 E:0.108798 |  But, Micah, those men in red shirts in particular,
[7161.40 - 7163.40] P:1632.29 E:0.111879 |  are taking all the adulation.
[7163.40 - 7168.40] P:1728.24 E:0.099654 |  Yeah, they've been absolutely brilliant in this tournament.
[7168.40 - 7170.40] P:1761.19 E:0.126243 |  There's a lot of emotions going through,
[7170.40 - 7172.40] P:1740.11 E:0.112432 |  there's highs, there's lows,
[7172.40 - 7174.40] P:1709.05 E:0.104728 |  because they were so close to them in this game.
[7174.40 - 7179.40] P:1835.54 E:0.098659 |  I mean, the class in the end showed with France and their finishing,
[7179.40 - 7183.40] P:1858.42 E:0.104993 |  but in terms of what they gave to this whole game,
[7183.40 - 7185.40] P:1910.15 E:0.099147 |  the game was outstanding,
[7185.40 - 7188.40] P:1881.94 E:0.103966 |  and that is exactly why the fans are staying there
[7188.40 - 7190.40] P:1845.30 E:0.107585 |  to support their team off,
[7190.40 - 7194.40] P:1954.02 E:0.100392 |  from the defence to them in the field, to the strikers.
[7194.40 - 7196.40] P:1809.55 E:0.091373 |  They just give absolutely everything,
[7196.40 - 7199.40] P:1810.36 E:0.107784 |  with a depleted squad as well,
[7199.40 - 7201.40] P:1802.11 E:0.091236 |  and that's what makes it even better.
[7201.40 - 7204.40] P:1750.43 E:0.091090 |  There was all together in this,
[7204.40 - 7207.40] P:1753.76 E:0.104460 |  and unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be,
[7207.40 - 7209.40] P:1875.49 E:0.106501 |  but they're still heroes.
[7210.40 - 7215.40] P:1517.15 E:0.098494 |  The Moroccan players, as a group, then dropped to their knees
[7215.40 - 7219.40] P:1399.52 E:0.100363 |  and offered thanks to those Moroccan fans
[7219.40 - 7222.40] P:1520.08 E:0.115532 |  in a very understated, very calm way.
[7223.40 - 7226.40] P:1461.73 E:0.116817 |  And they are standing there with their heads bowed now,
[7226.40 - 7229.40] P:1571.65 E:0.112791 |  they've gone back onto their feet, they're standing with their heads bowed,
[7229.40 - 7233.40] P:1441.60 E:0.112211 |  and the Moroccan fans continue to applaud them and cheer them.
[7234.40 - 7238.40] P:1577.64 E:0.104498 |  And Roman Sice makes his way to the edge of the penalty area
[7238.40 - 7240.40] P:1545.26 E:0.112596 |  on his own, applauding and waving.
[7240.40 - 7243.40] P:1620.10 E:0.092646 |  It's as if, John Murray, at the moment,
[7243.40 - 7246.40] P:1627.07 E:0.099496 |  none of them really want to leave the scene.
[7247.40 - 7249.40] P:1778.91 E:0.107335 |  Well, it's understandable, isn't it?
[7249.40 - 7252.40] P:1665.11 E:0.100225 |  I mean, the emotions that they've been through as well.
[7252.40 - 7255.40] P:1728.85 E:0.095152 |  I think the pressure, too, you know, remember about it,
[7255.40 - 7258.40] P:1768.07 E:0.102991 |  the top-class footballers, so they get pressure all of the time,
[7258.40 - 7264.40] P:1703.62 E:0.091475 |  but I think, you know, they will not have been able to have ignored
[7264.40 - 7269.40] P:1756.78 E:0.100401 |  or got away from the pressure that will have been involved
[7269.40 - 7271.40] P:1893.24 E:0.093867 |  on what they've achieved at this World Cup
[7271.40 - 7274.40] P:1732.44 E:0.104396 |  and the magnitude of what they were coming into today
[7274.40 - 7278.40] P:1730.80 E:0.099347 |  to play in a World Cup semi-final.
[7278.40 - 7283.40] P:1618.83 E:0.101448 |  And, you know, that takes a nervous energy all of its own.
[7283.40 - 7286.40] P:1657.76 E:0.101440 |  And to be able to produce the performance that they did here tonight,
[7286.40 - 7288.40] P:1600.47 E:0.107712 |  and now it's a slow walk around,
[7288.40 - 7291.40] P:1627.01 E:0.094115 |  and they've recognised the fact that there are actually Moroccan fans
[7291.40 - 7295.40] P:1650.68 E:0.102355 |  all around the stadium, so they're actually going to make sure
[7295.40 - 7298.40] P:1607.63 E:0.103057 |  that all of them are acknowledged in all three tiers.
[7298.40 - 7300.40] P:1587.47 E:0.081699 |  They are.
[7300.40 - 7305.40] P:1623.13 E:0.098730 |  And the French fans have stayed to acknowledge them as well, Julien Laurent.
[7305.40 - 7310.40] P:1702.66 E:0.105759 |  Yeah, the stayed. I mean, they obviously clapped and applauded the French first,
[7310.40 - 7313.40] P:1618.68 E:0.112306 |  who then went to the Garden of Honor made by the rest of the staff
[7313.40 - 7315.40] P:1762.88 E:0.102416 |  back into the dressing room, and then...
[7315.40 - 7320.40] P:1858.41 E:0.104067 |  And then, I think, yeah, you pay your tribute for this story of this World Cup.
[7320.40 - 7323.40] P:1686.64 E:0.100669 |  Of course, very soon we're going to talk about the final
[7323.40 - 7326.40] P:1868.25 E:0.107878 |  and France, Argentina in a way.
[7326.40 - 7329.40] P:1953.27 E:0.114936 |  A bit of a dream final, and Bapé against Messi
[7329.40 - 7331.40] P:1844.37 E:0.106638 |  and all that kind of narrative and stories,
[7331.40 - 7333.40] P:1807.61 E:0.108724 |  but this Moroccan side is the story of this World Cup.
[7333.40 - 7335.40] P:1596.57 E:0.103379 |  They've been incredible.
[7335.40 - 7338.40] P:1814.18 E:0.116268 |  This can only be the beginning for why he's a very talented squad
[7338.40 - 7342.40] P:1930.65 E:0.111453 |  with a very talented head coach as well, and amazing fans.
[7342.40 - 7346.40] P:1987.44 E:0.113072 |  And I think the French would be very happy to show their tribute
[7346.40 - 7349.40] P:1904.82 E:0.106583 |  and show what an amazing team they are.
[7349.40 - 7353.40] P:1765.58 E:0.105429 |  And today, there were definitely not two goals in between those two teams.
[7353.40 - 7359.40] P:1584.44 E:0.109127 |  Oh, and I'm looking at Regregi now and his coaches, staff and their arm-in-arm
[7359.40 - 7364.40] P:1491.85 E:0.096585 |  arms around each other. There are tiers down there as well.
[7364.40 - 7369.40] P:1510.50 E:0.100829 |  I think Roman Seiss has managed to get one of his children onto the pitch down there,
[7369.40 - 7375.40] P:1477.23 E:0.102457 |  as he just stands holding his child up, and they're just surveying the scene of this stadium.
[7375.40 - 7378.40] P:1538.07 E:0.099982 |  You know, we're at a World Cup semi-final, Chris.
[7378.40 - 7388.40] P:1467.31 E:0.094061 |  The French are into the final, but it feels wrong to focus on them at the moment.
[7388.40 - 7396.40] P:1665.71 E:0.105552 |  And Jules is laughing, but it does at the moment, and it doesn't often happen in sport
[7396.40 - 7401.40] P:1642.36 E:0.105931 |  where you get to a semi-final stage, whatever the sport, whatever the competition,
[7401.40 - 7405.40] P:1594.79 E:0.101334 |  where you focus on the losers for the first part.
[7405.40 - 7409.40] P:1676.08 E:0.104392 |  No, I mean, going into the game is the world champions against, I think,
[7409.40 - 7414.40] P:1557.96 E:0.101746 |  the world's favourite team, Morocco, because they have shocked everybody in this tournament.
[7414.40 - 7419.40] P:1613.07 E:0.106442 |  Nobody could have seen this Moroccan team going this deep and far in the competition.
[7419.40 - 7422.40] P:1634.58 E:0.102265 |  And in many respects, it's not just that.
[7422.40 - 7426.40] P:1581.83 E:0.105208 |  It's how they've done it, and the way they've played, the way they've set up,
[7426.40 - 7431.40] P:1566.74 E:0.101202 |  the way that they've been superbly organised, the way that they have carried a threat.
[7431.40 - 7436.40] P:1650.85 E:0.101943 |  I think the biggest disappointment for them tonight was going into the game,
[7436.40 - 7438.40] P:1619.54 E:0.093801 |  and you touched on how fit were they going to be?
[7438.40 - 7442.40] P:1645.22 E:0.107449 |  Were they going to have their key men back, and when you're playing the world champions,
[7442.40 - 7448.40] P:1602.66 E:0.098425 |  you need your big headers back to stand any chance, and they just came up a little bit short,
[7448.40 - 7453.40] P:1529.33 E:0.100411 |  but they are the team that everybody will remember and talk about from this World Cup.
[7453.40 - 7459.40] P:1570.60 E:0.102460 |  And quite rightly, the Amnesty fans, of their fans, they've outnumbered the French,
[7459.40 - 7466.40] P:1568.05 E:0.104656 |  I don't know, 8 to 1, 9 to 1, whatever it is, but that tells you everything about
[7466.40 - 7471.40] P:1492.05 E:0.105619 |  how the Moroccan fans feel about their manager and their team.
[7471.40 - 7474.40] P:1522.33 E:0.099339 |  They can be a proud country this evening.
[7474.40 - 7481.40] P:1814.63 E:0.093115 |  The frustration, Mike, from the Moroccan points of view, is that they had chances this evening.
[7481.40 - 7486.40] P:1903.45 E:0.077783 |  There were sorts of half chances, but they had chances.
[7486.40 - 7490.40] P:1768.98 E:0.097050 |  I think there was more than half chances, if you're being totally honest.
[7490.40 - 7495.40] P:1928.89 E:0.090656 |  I think it was just that little bit of composure on the final pass.
[7495.40 - 7502.40] P:1905.34 E:0.093657 |  They got into really good areas, especially down the sides, and they just sort of snatched at things a little bit.
[7502.40 - 7505.40] P:1904.76 E:0.090453 |  And I think they'll be kicking themselves going off the pitch thinking,
[7505.40 - 7507.40] P:1933.57 E:0.078616 |  we actually could have done that today.
[7507.40 - 7513.40] P:1944.81 E:0.094592 |  I mean, France always looked like they could step up when they needed to, if I'm being totally honest.
[7513.40 - 7518.40] P:1955.95 E:0.090422 |  I think if Morocco would have scored, then France probably could have scored again.
[7518.40 - 7523.40] P:1913.90 E:0.098233 |  Even Mbappe in the second half was running back a little bit because he had seen his team was under pressure.
[7523.40 - 7530.40] P:1932.48 E:0.091444 |  But I just think they lacked that little bit of quality in the moment, but for sure, they did have chances.
[7531.40 - 7533.40] P:1821.32 E:0.091583 |  Hamdalla in particular, Chris.
[7535.40 - 7541.40] P:1879.49 E:0.098722 |  Yeah, I think there's a shoeman who gave the ball away in the middle of the park.
[7541.40 - 7548.40] P:1825.70 E:0.095736 |  He had a couple of opportunities driving at the French back line where he just shifted it and had half a yard.
[7548.40 - 7552.40] P:1732.78 E:0.097353 |  He could have got the shot off, and he's trying to walk the ball into the back of the net.
[7552.40 - 7558.40] P:1722.22 E:0.090372 |  And he came on for a niziri up top, didn't he?
[7558.40 - 7562.40] P:1837.81 E:0.091835 |  And just lacked that quality in the big moments.
[7562.40 - 7566.40] P:1812.60 E:0.095305 |  You're not going to get a lot of opportunities against this French team,
[7566.40 - 7571.40] P:1830.29 E:0.094589 |  and when they come along, you have to be absolutely ruthless and clinical.
[7571.40 - 7575.40] P:1629.28 E:0.090332 |  And unfortunately for Morocco, they were anything but that this evening.
[7576.40 - 7580.40] P:1844.33 E:0.096891 |  It would probably have been Shadira who would have come on, wouldn't it?
[7580.40 - 7584.40] P:1836.92 E:0.093504 |  Had he not been suspended, which he has done in the two knockout matches,
[7584.40 - 7589.40] P:1906.88 E:0.099919 |  who also, you know, was a brilliant tryer, Shadira, but they didn't have him tonight.
[7589.40 - 7596.40] P:1927.56 E:0.087149 |  And in actual fact, Hamdalla had not scored for Morocco since 2014.
[7596.40 - 7599.40] P:1866.40 E:0.092213 |  So, you know, that's a barren spell.
[7599.40 - 7604.40] P:1927.46 E:0.077342 |  That is a barren spell, Chris, and if anyone would recognise one, then...
[7604.40 - 7608.40] P:1816.03 E:0.119108 |  Wow, that's disrespectful to him now.
[7608.40 - 7610.40] P:1913.71 E:0.104706 |  I never went eight years without a goal.
[7610.40 - 7612.40] P:1777.89 E:0.103054 |  I didn't finish that sentence.
[7612.40 - 7616.40] P:1826.20 E:0.094881 |  It would be someone who'd not scored for eight years.
[7616.40 - 7623.40] P:1823.50 E:0.101047 |  I want to bring in Morocco football journalist Amin El-Amri, who is live in the stadium.
[7623.40 - 7625.40] P:1860.13 E:0.089678 |  Evening, Amin.
[7627.40 - 7631.40] P:1909.59 E:0.103158 |  Good evening. I see some... I hear some tackles going on in there.
[7631.40 - 7635.40] P:1724.46 E:0.100813 |  Yeah, yeah, we are two foot at two foot of tackling each other.
[7635.40 - 7642.40] P:1711.66 E:0.088559 |  You must feel a sense of disappointment, I suppose, but also an immense sense of pride.
[7643.40 - 7646.40] P:1960.60 E:0.087862 |  Yeah, of course, of course. It's a mix of both.
[7646.40 - 7653.40] P:1879.90 E:0.080754 |  You have this, you know, this unachieved goal,
[7653.40 - 7658.40] P:1884.42 E:0.094095 |  but at the same time, you were beyond your wider stream.
[7658.40 - 7666.40] P:1965.47 E:0.080156 |  So, yeah, it's a mix of both, a bit of disappointment, but also so much, so much pride.
[7667.40 - 7675.40] P:1950.78 E:0.091948 |  Did you feel the last couple of substitutions maybe just caused Morocco to lose a little bit of momentum?
[7678.40 - 7684.40] P:2007.13 E:0.088998 |  Yeah, I guess what happened is that we completely messed up our approach to the game.
[7684.40 - 7693.40] P:1952.16 E:0.093087 |  I guess the stakes were so high and, yeah, insisting on playing injured players like Masarawi and Seis,
[7693.40 - 7698.40] P:1969.62 E:0.081043 |  we just didn't do it against a wonderful team that is France.
[7700.40 - 7706.40] P:1876.15 E:0.091704 |  Far beyond what happened in the second half, and it is what it is, you know,
[7706.40 - 7712.40] P:1906.49 E:0.094219 |  when you come in with players that are not as good as you're starting in 11.
[7712.40 - 7717.40] P:1869.05 E:0.088616 |  Yeah, but anyways, I think the approach to the game was messed up.
[7718.40 - 7724.40] P:1910.80 E:0.091686 |  But I suppose you can understand why they began the way they did, because of all the emotions around this.
[7727.40 - 7732.40] P:1850.82 E:0.085609 |  Yes, of course, I mean, it's always been like that.
[7732.40 - 7740.40] P:1956.08 E:0.079201 |  I think what France really is good at is kind of manage those kind of situations.
[7740.40 - 7745.40] P:1950.05 E:0.084475 |  Morocco has been for the first time in this tournament in control of the possession of the ball.
[7745.40 - 7752.40] P:1952.09 E:0.079081 |  And for the first time in the tournament, they trained after just four or five minutes.
[7752.40 - 7759.40] P:1837.54 E:0.087859 |  So I think that that was very, very clever from a very, very clever man that is Idier Deschamps.
[7760.40 - 7764.40] P:1815.60 E:0.083258 |  What happens next for this Moroccan team?
[7764.40 - 7770.40] P:1850.49 E:0.079204 |  How do you want to see them progress over the coming years?
[7772.40 - 7777.40] P:1982.22 E:0.100260 |  Well, first of all, I want to see them progress to the third place of the World Cup
[7777.40 - 7780.40] P:1913.35 E:0.091658 |  and beat Covistar on Saturday.
[7780.40 - 7787.40] P:1885.82 E:0.084264 |  But yeah, I guess what people would want is that to build from this
[7787.40 - 7794.40] P:2039.38 E:0.089870 |  and not to try and change anything like it's an analogy of what happened in the semifinal.
[7794.40 - 7803.40] P:1842.36 E:0.085316 |  You build on what you have and what you gained over the time and not try something new when it matters the most.
[7803.40 - 7814.40] P:1913.21 E:0.085003 |  So I think it's going to be building up from this, taking out some pieces, adding up some new pieces, some new faces, and there are.
[7815.40 - 7820.40] P:1852.39 E:0.079488 |  And yeah, hoping for this momentum to continue many, many years.
[7820.40 - 7827.40] P:1890.09 E:0.091487 |  And I don't want to end on a negative, but obviously you can't lose players at international level.
[7827.40 - 7830.40] P:1873.24 E:0.097061 |  Do you worry about maybe losing the manager?
[7833.40 - 7843.40] P:1899.21 E:0.097828 |  Yeah, I guess what we've seen in this World Cup is that no matter who plays and no matter who is fit,
[7844.40 - 7856.40] P:1822.73 E:0.090345 |  it's all about the group and it's all about that family that has been constituted around this group, around this man that is Welidra Gregi.
[7856.40 - 7866.40] P:1867.90 E:0.088203 |  So I guess if you change the pieces, the policy and the objective and the goal would be the same.
[7866.40 - 7875.40] P:1839.36 E:0.087601 |  And the next goal is actually the African Cup of Nations, which we won only once in 1976.
[7875.40 - 7878.40] P:2048.76 E:0.096933 |  So there would be a huge challenge to have.
[7878.40 - 7880.40] P:1758.37 E:0.064371 |  Thank you very much for coming on.
[7880.40 - 7882.40] P:1770.59 E:0.095507 |  I mean, really appreciate it.
[7882.40 - 7888.40] P:1699.22 E:0.091718 |  Moroccan football journalist, Al-Amri, who is live in the stadium with us on Five Live Sport.
[7888.40 - 7891.40] P:1834.52 E:0.082133 |  I know Jules, you're thinking we're not going to talk France at all.
[7891.40 - 7895.40] P:1867.95 E:0.101274 |  And my final line of the evening will be, and Frans are in the final.
[7895.40 - 7896.40] P:1887.82 E:0.084736 |  And that's it.
[7896.40 - 7906.40] P:1889.97 E:0.084725 |  We will do France in a moment, but you would imagine there will be clubs across Europe who will probably be looking at Gregi, but certainly in Ligue 1.
[7906.40 - 7908.40] P:1990.15 E:0.080979 |  Yeah, certainly in Ligue 1.
[7908.40 - 7910.40] P:2149.38 E:0.109001 |  Yeah, and I think that's probably the next step for him.
[7910.40 - 7911.40] P:1904.82 E:0.101041 |  Not now.
[7911.40 - 7915.40] P:2126.73 E:0.092862 |  I think he would release the challenge of taking this team to Afghan in 2024.
[7915.40 - 7919.40] P:2081.21 E:0.092870 |  And rightly so because there's something special brewing there we've seen in this competition.
[7919.40 - 7924.40] P:2109.85 E:0.086619 |  Let's remind everyone today was his ninth game in charge.
[7924.40 - 7929.40] P:2182.48 E:0.098530 |  Ninth game and to be able to do that, the structure defensively, especially was there from the previous manager.
[7929.40 - 7935.40] P:2033.58 E:0.087700 |  We explained that in the pre-match build-up, but still and what they've done and what they've achieved in this tournament.
[7935.40 - 7945.40] P:1998.04 E:0.094378 |  If you keep that momentum going and Gregi continues why he started or why it continued from the previous manager as well, then I think they can achieve much, much better things.
[7945.40 - 7950.40] P:1936.68 E:0.092060 |  I don't know if they can do another semi-finals of the World Cup in four years, for example, that's a long time away.
[7950.40 - 7954.40] P:1926.26 E:0.087951 |  But certainly they would be amongst the favourites at the Afghan in 2024.
[7954.40 - 7962.40] P:1796.91 E:0.082863 |  Chris said in commentary, Mike, that the substitutions worked a lot better for the French than they did for the Moroccans.
[7962.40 - 7964.40] P:1888.90 E:0.100095 |  Yeah, I think so.
[7964.40 - 7974.40] P:1781.48 E:0.089181 |  I think Giroud looked a little bit isolated at times, allowed Turram to come on and go on to the left-hand side and then Batty to go down the central.
[7974.40 - 7981.40] P:1791.37 E:0.090366 |  I think it was more of a tactical move for defensively because you know Turram's going to run back, but he allowed him Batty to be free spirit.
[7981.40 - 7983.40] P:1568.86 E:0.105305 |  He was moving all over the place.
[7983.40 - 7992.40] P:1762.91 E:0.088262 |  I think if there's only one weakness to him Batty's game is receiving the ball when he's a number nine, but he didn't stay in one position.
[7992.40 - 8003.40] P:1690.87 E:0.091152 |  He allowed to move freely and then Colomani who come on, who we've talked a lot about before, watched him in the Champions League as well.
[8003.40 - 8008.40] P:1827.76 E:0.092097 |  I thought he was a lot younger than he was actually. What's he, 23-24 now?
[8008.40 - 8011.40] P:1766.83 E:0.093166 |  I think that was only his third or fourth cup, I think I'm right, Jules.
[8011.40 - 8024.40] P:1664.09 E:0.082984 |  He looks outstanding individually, but I've not seen him burst onto the scene for France yet, but this, the score, his first goal in the semi-final is exactly what you need.
[8024.40 - 8028.40] P:1769.64 E:0.077843 |  And in the end, I think the substitutions made the difference.
[8028.40 - 8032.40] P:1825.57 E:0.080980 |  Yeah, I mean it wasn't the most complicated of finishes, was it?
[8032.40 - 8035.40] P:1730.55 E:0.085875 |  No, it wasn't, it was all down to him Batty, wasn't it?
[8035.40 - 8044.40] P:1725.24 E:0.090069 |  I mean the way he runs, the thing he's about killing them Batty, let me break this down for you, is he doesn't need to be involved in the game for 90 minutes.
[8044.40 - 8050.40] P:1852.52 E:0.086734 |  It's five minutes of genius that can just turn a game on its head.
[8050.40 - 8060.40] P:1772.76 E:0.087542 |  He is by far, I know Messi's doing ridiculous things now, but and Batty, when he's on the ball, I've not seen anything like it.
[8060.40 - 8066.40] P:1729.71 E:0.091743 |  He's an absolute joy to watch, and every time he gets the ball, I'm like, what's he going to do next?
[8066.40 - 8074.40] P:1793.84 E:0.087678 |  His touch, his technique, he's running behind, and defenders are frightened of him, absolutely frightened.
[8074.40 - 8080.40] P:1799.34 E:0.099509 |  I've got to say, just on Mouane, I mean he's had a great evening, his first touch scored, you know, the goal which has put this semi-final to bed,
[8080.40 - 8083.40] P:1701.94 E:0.097704 |  and you're sort of saying, oh well, you know, that's easy.
[8083.40 - 8086.40] P:1873.13 E:0.102370 |  That's right, right, right time, I mean, I'm not going to give him a bit.
[8086.40 - 8088.40] P:1766.65 E:0.101291 |  I'm not worried about stealing his thunder.
[8088.40 - 8093.40] P:1715.54 E:0.101579 |  Well, alright, well, okay, well, let me try and redress the balance here.
[8093.40 - 8102.40] P:1837.14 E:0.087665 |  That's the third quickest goal for a substitute in World Cup history for Colin Mouane, he scored it after just 44 seconds.
[8102.40 - 8110.40] P:1746.96 E:0.084861 |  And the other interesting thing with Mouane and Mbappe is that they're from the same town in northeast Paris.
[8110.40 - 8116.40] P:1945.50 E:0.102361 |  Yeah, and Saliba as well, Saliba as well, both Colin Mouane and Saliba had Kylian's dad Wilfred as a coach,
[8116.40 - 8123.40] P:1952.37 E:0.092299 |  because he coaches in that grassroot team at Bondi, so they've known each other for a long time.
[8123.40 - 8129.40] P:1920.97 E:0.103633 |  But Mbappe is right, for Colin Mouane, he was a very late bloomer because he didn't go to an academy like the usual path,
[8129.40 - 8134.40] P:2020.18 E:0.087334 |  and then I know he really exploded last season, then left to go to Antwerp,
[8134.40 - 8142.40] P:1906.82 E:0.090002 |  and went to Antwerp, Frankfurt, where he is having a really good season with the sliga, so this is a reward for all the hard work that he's put in the last 18 months or so.
[8142.40 - 8147.40] P:1676.74 E:0.086208 |  Yeah, so all I was saying was it wasn't that goal that made him burst onto the scene.
[8147.40 - 8149.40] P:1814.53 E:0.095287 |  That was all I was trying to say.
[8149.40 - 8153.40] P:1682.46 E:0.088175 |  I'd take a goal in the semi-final of a World Cup, me too.
[8153.40 - 8162.40] P:1792.38 E:0.081813 |  The bigger picture with France, they've now reached the World Cup final four times in the last seven tournaments.
[8162.40 - 8170.40] P:1877.42 E:0.087965 |  It's 98, 2006, 2018 and 2022, twice more than any other nation over that period.
[8170.40 - 8179.40] P:1815.09 E:0.078841 |  Also, if you expand it a little bit, Jules, of the last 13 finals, if you include the Euros, the French have made six of those,
[8179.40 - 8188.40] P:1869.34 E:0.084320 |  which is a remarkable record, particularly in most of the rest of those tournaments in between have implode gone on strike,
[8188.40 - 8192.40] P:1881.72 E:0.091855 |  archies, whatever it is. It is either feast or famine.
[8192.40 - 8199.40] P:2001.83 E:0.097717 |  Completely, and I was waiting for you to go like, well, yeah, the other competitions, they imploded completely, which we did.
[8199.40 - 8209.40] P:2041.95 E:0.094513 |  I think Deschamps did an incredible job, if you just look at how he's timed 10 years now, quarter-final in 2014, final 2016, winning 2018.
[8209.40 - 8213.40] P:2032.93 E:0.087363 |  The last Euros was more complicated, and then final again.
[8213.40 - 8221.40] P:2014.25 E:0.086542 |  This time, you have to count us as among the top nations in those kind of competitions.
[8221.40 - 8225.40] P:2028.46 E:0.103200 |  It's not always pretty, and I don't think it was pretty tonight, and I don't think it was good enough.
[8225.40 - 8228.40] P:2060.21 E:0.100362 |  For example, I don't think if you play like this against Argentina on Sunday...
[8228.40 - 8230.40] P:1828.33 E:0.091228 |  Never happy, Jules, are you?
[8230.40 - 8234.40] P:2045.39 E:0.093219 |  I don't think you win. Like you, Chris. I think you must be French somehow as well.
[8234.40 - 8239.40] P:1851.65 E:0.093017 |  But it doesn't matter because this is a winning team.
[8239.40 - 8244.40] P:1687.08 E:0.092502 |  But how is the French public with that? With the sort of boring brand of football?
[8244.40 - 8252.40] P:1935.66 E:0.095569 |  It's very mixed feelings because tonight I can guarantee you there's people very happy by the result, and this is a result, this is a game about results anyway.
[8252.40 - 8257.40] P:2084.38 E:0.103610 |  And there's other people saying like, even without the players, even without the players that we mentioned who are missing,
[8257.40 - 8261.40] P:1827.26 E:0.091930 |  with this squad and this talent, they should be playing better than that.
[8261.40 - 8268.40] P:1940.09 E:0.100853 |  You shouldn't have 39% of the ball against Morocco in a semi-final of the World Cup when you have a better squad than them, when you've got the experience that they don't have.
[8268.40 - 8273.40] P:2066.41 E:0.096167 |  And I can understand the debate, and it was exactly the same in 2018.
[8273.40 - 8278.40] P:2074.62 E:0.100867 |  This is a team that is very similar to the one I won four years ago in so many respects.
[8278.40 - 8284.40] P:2022.26 E:0.093979 |  And I mean, it would be because it's the same coach, but the debate again between today and Sunday would be exactly the same.
[8284.40 - 8286.40] P:1651.24 E:0.095057 |  Do France want to be Spain then?
[8286.40 - 8292.40] P:1960.96 E:0.077997 |  They don't, but I think it's a fair case to say that they could play better.
[8292.40 - 8296.40] P:1848.94 E:0.096785 |  They're like a German team of all, aren't they? Just efficient.
[8296.40 - 8299.40] P:1749.13 E:0.089024 |  It doesn't matter, Chris.
[8299.40 - 8306.40] P:1742.21 E:0.092683 |  England would take playing like that and winning a World Cup.
[8306.40 - 8312.40] P:1790.46 E:0.089334 |  I mean, if you talk about the development, Jules, you're probably talking about having a style of play for 10, 15...
[8312.40 - 8317.40] P:1821.31 E:0.093829 |  I don't care what anyone says. Get me to two World Cup finals.
[8317.40 - 8320.40] P:1777.92 E:0.083425 |  I know, but a lot of the public wouldn't take that, Mike, would they?
[8320.40 - 8324.40] P:1719.47 E:0.086466 |  They don't want England playing tournament football and boring people.
[8325.40 - 8327.40] P:1771.59 E:0.084063 |  I don't know what the public want anymore.
[8327.40 - 8332.40] P:1985.48 E:0.107631 |  It's the internal debate anyway of what would you go for, and really you win by playing well.
[8332.40 - 8334.40] P:1940.74 E:0.089690 |  You win by having a strong defence.
[8334.40 - 8338.40] P:1766.35 E:0.091990 |  Yeah, but let me ask you this, Jules. Even you know France didn't play that well today.
[8338.40 - 8341.40] P:1748.39 E:0.082637 |  Don't you think, on a switch, you could turn it on?
[8341.40 - 8342.40] P:2013.95 E:0.109941 |  Yeah, you're right.
[8342.40 - 8344.40] P:1379.76 E:0.119646 |  It's the same as England as well. I was nervous.
[8344.40 - 8348.40] P:1588.23 E:0.091065 |  England was a better team on the night, but dangerous.
[8348.40 - 8354.40] P:1646.28 E:0.094271 |  If you talk about danger, every time France go forward, even Dembele, you didn't play that great at times,
[8354.40 - 8360.40] P:1710.89 E:0.086827 |  but he's got that passion, he's got that skill, and he's got that directness that puts a fear into other teams.
[8360.40 - 8364.40] P:1851.50 E:0.091895 |  It's true, although I would like to see Dembele dribbling more with the ball,
[8364.40 - 8367.40] P:1670.59 E:0.100977 |  because right now I don't know what they've done with him.
[8367.40 - 8372.40] P:1877.97 E:0.088785 |  He defends more than in attacks, but for still, again, we go back to Deschamps' chapters for your next question,
[8372.40 - 8376.40] P:1985.04 E:0.095020 |  in the sense that he's made this team a ruthless winning team.
[8376.40 - 8380.40] P:1928.63 E:0.095395 |  That's all they care about, and trust me, right now, none of those players will care about if they played well,
[8380.40 - 8384.40] P:2044.89 E:0.098657 |  if they had a lot of the ball, if they created chances, what the expected goal is,
[8384.40 - 8388.40] P:1836.12 E:0.097837 |  and is an or against a what they could not care less. It's all about winning.
[8388.40 - 8393.40] P:1632.32 E:0.085700 |  I'm not sure they're dull. I mean, they play some good football in this tournament,
[8393.40 - 8396.40] P:1583.21 E:0.079300 |  and Morocco went toe-to-toe with them tonight.
[8396.40 - 8397.40] P:1701.63 E:0.095121 |  Yeah.
[8397.40 - 8398.40] P:1843.93 E:0.073658 |  Do you think, Chris?
[8398.40 - 8405.40] P:1752.14 E:0.086284 |  Yeah, I do, but you always feel that there could be more to come from France.
[8405.40 - 8406.40] P:1525.73 E:0.075850 |  I do.
[8406.40 - 8409.40] P:1702.40 E:0.099021 |  They're like a Citroen. What are the roads called in France? Auto-root.
[8409.40 - 8413.40] P:1777.22 E:0.105710 |  And they're sort of in third gear, and they could go through more gears.
[8413.40 - 8414.40] P:1975.62 E:0.117925 |  Did you just say auto-root?
[8414.40 - 8415.40] P:1876.90 E:0.073666 |  Yes, that's right.
[8415.40 - 8416.40] P:1907.47 E:0.089523 |  Chris?
[8416.40 - 8417.40] P:1801.47 E:0.104659 |  I don't know.
[8417.40 - 8418.40] P:1804.44 E:0.117955 |  It's perfect.
[8418.40 - 8422.40] P:1808.71 E:0.098057 |  You feel like there's so much more to come, and also throughout the tournament,
[8422.40 - 8428.40] P:1705.72 E:0.090631 |  in games that sort of played well in Patch, they're similar to Argentina, but a bit better.
[8428.40 - 8433.40] P:1751.08 E:0.089784 |  But there isn't a single team at this tournament who's played well in every single game.
[8433.40 - 8434.40] P:1586.35 E:0.100875 |  I mean, there isn't.
[8434.40 - 8436.40] P:1569.63 E:0.108825 |  No, I agree with that, but we can.
[8436.40 - 8442.40] P:1777.07 E:0.082544 |  You know, I mean, Jules, the French expert, is like Mike is saying,
[8442.40 - 8445.40] P:1726.27 E:0.097459 |  if England were France, we'd be loving it, wouldn't we?
[8445.40 - 8448.40] P:1737.51 E:0.095918 |  Because, you know, getting to major finals, winning World Cups,
[8448.40 - 8451.40] P:1774.68 E:0.089464 |  but France are doing it, and there are some people within France
[8451.40 - 8453.40] P:1476.66 E:0.098264 |  who are unhappy with the brand of football.
[8453.40 - 8454.40] P:1655.14 E:0.058132 |  Yeah.
[8454.40 - 8456.40] P:1808.23 E:0.093708 |  It's all about creating a culture, isn't it?
[8456.40 - 8460.40] P:1730.30 E:0.094863 |  It's about creating a culture where you win things that we've been talking about.
[8460.40 - 8464.40] P:1610.03 E:0.080749 |  And, you know, when I was growing up, France were nowhere.
[8464.40 - 8468.40] P:1494.70 E:0.080765 |  You know, and I remember in the 70s, you know, you would...
[8468.40 - 8470.40] P:1589.44 E:0.097684 |  I mean, they were one of the also-rants.
[8470.40 - 8472.40] P:1507.11 E:0.094647 |  You wouldn't consider France the top.
[8472.40 - 8474.40] P:1693.36 E:0.093228 |  And then the Platini era came along.
[8474.40 - 8476.40] P:1696.97 E:0.110153 |  They won the Euros, and they won a tournament.
[8476.40 - 8479.40] P:1670.76 E:0.085438 |  And then, since then, we've seen them do what they do.
[8479.40 - 8482.40] P:1800.73 E:0.094148 |  But even then, when I was growing up, 20 years after you,
[8482.40 - 8483.40] P:1912.02 E:0.104257 |  in the...
[8483.40 - 8488.40] P:1836.47 E:0.095864 |  They did win those Euros, did the press.
[8488.40 - 8492.40] P:1735.56 E:0.091013 |  And then they were nowhere after that for a long time.
[8492.40 - 8498.40] P:1645.35 E:0.086271 |  So it is a very modern success story, is the French going back from...
[8498.40 - 8500.40] P:1735.88 E:0.088486 |  Really, from 98.
[8500.40 - 8502.40] P:1708.54 E:0.095092 |  And I know we could go over Clare Fontaine again as well.
[8502.40 - 8508.40] P:1727.53 E:0.089872 |  But I saw another thing on social media from Pete Parcell saying,
[8508.40 - 8513.40] P:1710.72 E:0.081402 |  on top of all of that, through their successful periods,
[8513.40 - 8515.40] P:1674.76 E:0.088042 |  the French have had a generational talent.
[8515.40 - 8518.40] P:1547.16 E:0.093385 |  They've arguably had the best player in the world
[8518.40 - 8519.40] P:1708.06 E:0.071752 |  for those...
[8519.40 - 8523.40] P:1582.31 E:0.085224 |  When those teams are successful, Zidane, Henri and now Mbappe.
[8523.40 - 8525.40] P:2097.49 E:0.117341 |  Yeah, yeah, and even Platini for the Euros, 84,
[8525.40 - 8529.40] P:2028.75 E:0.097366 |  and then the 82 and 86 work-ups where they lost to Germany in the semifinals.
[8529.40 - 8531.40] P:1968.95 E:0.076286 |  They lost...
[8531.40 - 8534.40] P:2105.61 E:0.098440 |  In 58, they lost the semifinals in 82 and in 86.
[8534.40 - 8536.40] P:2062.06 E:0.102373 |  The first three semifinals of the work-ups, they lost them.
[8536.40 - 8539.40] P:1937.97 E:0.079785 |  Since then, they've won each of them.
[8539.40 - 8543.40] P:1955.91 E:0.097052 |  And in 98, and the four that we mentioned already,
[8543.40 - 8548.40] P:1867.29 E:0.095967 |  they won the last five semifinals before tonight, so 6'9", they've won.
[8548.40 - 8553.40] P:1871.34 E:0.089839 |  And I think you create, like John was saying, that we need mentality.
[8553.40 - 8556.40] P:1956.96 E:0.076731 |  And I think Deschamps is the architect of that.
[8556.40 - 8560.40] P:1879.70 E:0.099595 |  And I think some of the players who've been there since he took over in 2012,
[8560.40 - 8564.40] P:1939.06 E:0.094642 |  like Varen, like Grisman, like Lloris, have kind of cultivated that as well,
[8564.40 - 8566.40] P:2029.41 E:0.090251 |  to the sense that now they don't panic.
[8566.40 - 8568.40] P:2006.78 E:0.109419 |  This game is very similar to the England game.
[8568.40 - 8569.40] P:1979.50 E:0.095190 |  Micah is right.
[8569.40 - 8570.40] P:1907.48 E:0.103669 |  We're sitting here and we say the same thing.
[8570.40 - 8571.40] P:1972.37 E:0.083383 |  They're ruthless.
[8571.40 - 8572.40] P:1992.71 E:0.086323 |  They don't panic.
[8572.40 - 8575.40] P:1998.86 E:0.092862 |  They stay calm and they take their chances, although they missed a few today.
[8575.40 - 8578.40] P:1934.22 E:0.084108 |  But still, they have...
[8578.40 - 8580.40] P:1790.26 E:0.098921 |  And everything is going their way right now.
[8580.40 - 8584.40] P:1955.51 E:0.100186 |  And you know what they're going to love about Sunday is that Argentina and Messi will be their favourite.
[8584.40 - 8587.40] P:1933.54 E:0.090193 |  And they will be the underdogs, and that suits them perfectly.
[8587.40 - 8588.40] P:1726.13 E:0.064970 |  No.
[8588.40 - 8589.40] P:1785.29 E:0.099407 |  They will.
[8589.40 - 8591.40] P:1628.23 E:0.115598 |  No, no, no, no, no.
[8591.40 - 8592.40] P:1617.73 E:0.101633 |  Of course they will.
[8592.40 - 8595.40] P:1832.18 E:0.107018 |  Right now, you would say that they're favourite against Argentina and Messi.
[8595.40 - 8598.40] P:1797.75 E:0.112485 |  You say that's your reverse psychology again every game.
[8598.40 - 8600.40] P:1649.74 E:0.115907 |  You cry it in.
[8600.40 - 8603.40] P:2013.41 E:0.090027 |  And he's working so far, would be crazy to change anyway.
[8603.40 - 8607.40] P:1596.61 E:0.091643 |  So what happens to the champ at the end of this competition?
[8607.40 - 8608.40] P:1773.05 E:0.121476 |  Well, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[8608.40 - 8613.40] P:1707.06 E:0.079435 |  Just before you answer that, you think Argentina are favourites for Sunday?
[8613.40 - 8614.40] P:2082.55 E:0.102703 |  Of course, it's Messi.
[8614.40 - 8616.40] P:1863.58 E:0.114041 |  It's saying that with a straight face.
[8616.40 - 8619.40] P:1900.81 E:0.092458 |  Who do you think are favourites for Sunday?
[8619.40 - 8620.40] P:1789.40 E:0.052467 |  It's a joke.
[8620.40 - 8622.40] P:1910.86 E:0.094990 |  I think it's 50-50.
[8622.40 - 8623.40] P:1838.46 E:0.109040 |  Oh, come on.
[8623.40 - 8625.40] P:1904.31 E:0.107114 |  That's not what you're paid to do.
[8625.40 - 8626.40] P:1884.17 E:0.112195 |  Come on.
[8626.40 - 8628.40] P:1943.55 E:0.097367 |  It's got to be 51-49 for someone.
[8628.40 - 8630.40] P:1893.16 E:0.097728 |  I'm paid to give my honest assessment.
[8630.40 - 8631.40] P:1849.36 E:0.078298 |  God.
[8631.40 - 8632.40] P:1840.88 E:0.048844 |  I think...
[8632.40 - 8635.40] P:1718.39 E:0.076216 |  I think France, actually, I think France are the favourites.
[8635.40 - 8638.40] P:1746.21 E:0.082089 |  Argentina have Messi and the fans.
[8638.40 - 8641.40] P:1625.88 E:0.095185 |  Chris, absolutely France.
[8641.40 - 8642.40] P:1545.78 E:0.110370 |  Absolutely France.
[8642.40 - 8643.40] P:1802.19 E:0.105365 |  Absolutely.
[8643.40 - 8644.40] P:1775.92 E:0.100759 |  Yes, it is.
[8644.40 - 8645.40] P:1702.06 E:0.112519 |  Messi's last World Cup.
[8645.40 - 8647.40] P:1658.32 E:0.052201 |  I'm with Chris.
[8647.40 - 8648.40] P:1852.76 E:0.113622 |  France.
[8648.40 - 8649.40] P:1276.17 E:0.098170 |  Don't let me down.
[8649.40 - 8650.40] P:1661.18 E:0.068561 |  I'm not.
[8650.40 - 8651.40] P:1695.94 E:0.038905 |  Cheers.
[8651.40 - 8654.40] P:1872.80 E:0.097760 |  I don't want to let you down, but I have to agree with Chris.
[8654.40 - 8655.40] P:1873.32 E:0.091323 |  You're such a blagger.
[8655.40 - 8656.40] P:1622.75 E:0.101675 |  What is blaggery?
[8656.40 - 8657.40] P:1911.97 E:0.096874 |  Blaggery in French.
[8657.40 - 8658.40] P:1915.33 E:0.097704 |  Blagger.
[8658.40 - 8659.40] P:1963.36 E:0.097516 |  Hell, blagger.
[8659.40 - 8662.40] P:1934.13 E:0.096740 |  And we thought...
[8662.40 - 8664.40] P:1971.37 E:0.088959 |  If you want to...
[8664.40 - 8667.40] P:1923.78 E:0.092934 |  Now you can ask your question about Dayshark, Chris.
[8667.40 - 8669.40] P:1817.61 E:0.072164 |  Come on.
[8669.40 - 8673.40] P:1702.93 E:0.106405 |  At the end of the tournament, what's going to happen
[8673.40 - 8676.40] P:1609.90 E:0.089694 |  if they win or lose the final?
[8676.40 - 8680.40] P:2015.48 E:0.086113 |  His contract is up on Sunday night.
[8680.40 - 8682.40] P:2092.00 E:0.109138 |  So he'll be down to him to choose what he wants to do.
[8682.40 - 8684.40] P:1729.38 E:0.090269 |  What's your feeling now?
[8684.40 - 8685.40] P:1912.16 E:0.092922 |  I think he's going to stay.
[8685.40 - 8686.40] P:1947.92 E:0.090104 |  I think he will be...
[8686.40 - 8690.40] P:1846.42 E:0.092956 |  Ten years is a long time, but ten years of success has gone very quickly.
[8690.40 - 8693.40] P:1992.09 E:0.090562 |  I mean, not that you can relate, but for us...
[8693.40 - 8695.40] P:1971.13 E:0.108093 |  Oh!
[8695.40 - 8697.40] P:1989.61 E:0.102348 |  For us in France, those ten years have gone so quickly
[8697.40 - 8700.40] P:1989.25 E:0.093409 |  because we've won so many things and achieved great...
[8700.40 - 8701.40] P:2011.30 E:0.114722 |  No, no, seriously.
[8701.40 - 8703.40] P:1533.19 E:0.085097 |  So what about Zidane then?
[8703.40 - 8704.40] P:1749.50 E:0.063689 |  Where does he...
[8704.40 - 8705.40] P:1831.54 E:0.120156 |  That's the thing.
[8705.40 - 8707.40] P:1952.13 E:0.104161 |  I think Zidane was convinced that this would be his time now.
[8707.40 - 8709.40] P:2002.41 E:0.107362 |  And Dayshark wins on Sunday.
[8709.40 - 8712.40] P:1804.16 E:0.093612 |  Imagine just him saying, listen, it's been great.
[8712.40 - 8714.40] P:1921.00 E:0.099274 |  Ten years, two World Cups, one Euros final.
[8715.40 - 8716.40] P:1998.60 E:0.051565 |  I can go...
[8716.40 - 8719.40] P:2004.51 E:0.108365 |  It will be the greatest ever manager international level.
[8719.40 - 8721.40] P:1700.32 E:0.108807 |  No one has ever done two in a row as a manager
[8721.40 - 8725.40] P:1947.24 E:0.102144 |  or even two full stop as a head coach winning the World Cup.
[8725.40 - 8727.40] P:2042.57 E:0.090000 |  So it will be special.
[8727.40 - 8728.40] P:1690.36 E:0.086897 |  And I also can see him leaving,
[8728.40 - 8731.40] P:2050.36 E:0.104556 |  but he's got such a great generation coming through.
[8731.40 - 8734.40] P:1882.80 E:0.080056 |  I mean, you can see him staying until the Euros.
[8734.40 - 8737.40] P:1833.11 E:0.086408 |  I think Vittorio Pozzo did it with Italy.
[8737.40 - 8738.40] P:1715.96 E:0.095393 |  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[8738.40 - 8739.40] P:2102.56 E:0.101346 |  That's true actually.
[8739.40 - 8741.40] P:1743.32 E:0.092795 |  In 34 and 38.
[8741.40 - 8742.40] P:1889.97 E:0.112139 |  Yeah, that's true.
[8742.40 - 8743.40] P:1790.99 E:0.051631 |  But...
[8743.40 - 8744.40] P:1943.83 E:0.056548 |  But still.
[8745.40 - 8746.40] P:1747.49 E:0.122482 |  Who told him that?
[8746.40 - 8747.40] P:1674.82 E:0.097081 |  Who told you that?
[8747.40 - 8750.40] P:1975.41 E:0.093867 |  No, I had a feeling when I said it, I thought Pozzo did, yeah.
[8750.40 - 8753.40] P:1685.12 E:0.089193 |  Yeah, I was just making that point,
[8753.40 - 8755.40] P:1825.52 E:0.097743 |  which would still be some achievement, John.
[8755.40 - 8757.40] P:1684.35 E:0.078078 |  Yeah, yes it would, absolutely.
[8762.40 - 8763.40] P:1921.53 E:0.103738 |  What kind of fight...
[8763.40 - 8765.40] P:1784.08 E:0.100236 |  Having seen both teams in the semi-finals,
[8765.40 - 8769.40] P:1676.53 E:0.082894 |  Zandmiker, what kind of final would you expect?
[8769.40 - 8773.40] P:1596.01 E:0.092367 |  Bear in mind, when the two teams met in Russia four years ago,
[8773.40 - 8775.40] P:1780.54 E:0.087437 |  it finished 4-3 to the French.
[8775.40 - 8779.40] P:1645.96 E:0.075982 |  There were eight cards and it was a hundinger.
[8780.40 - 8782.40] P:1834.36 E:0.093653 |  To be honest, I'm not quite sure.
[8782.40 - 8786.40] P:1824.31 E:0.081769 |  It depends which French team turns up,
[8786.40 - 8790.40] P:1571.85 E:0.075540 |  because I've seen it in bappé walking at times.
[8790.40 - 8793.40] P:1763.93 E:0.102646 |  I've seen Giroud not winning Jules tonight,
[8793.40 - 8796.40] P:1724.11 E:0.074519 |  but I've also seen, against England,
[8796.40 - 8800.40] P:1666.14 E:0.093524 |  when they needed to, everyone worked as a team together.
[8800.40 - 8802.40] P:1674.40 E:0.102930 |  You know the Argentina team are going to work hard.
[8802.40 - 8804.40] P:1743.74 E:0.084193 |  That's part of their team.
[8804.40 - 8806.40] P:1854.98 E:0.091457 |  The midfielders are brilliant.
[8806.40 - 8808.40] P:1694.88 E:0.090215 |  The centre-offs have been great.
[8808.40 - 8814.40] P:1711.33 E:0.088007 |  Otimendi as well as being, you know, a lot of people wrote him off.
[8814.40 - 8818.40] P:1900.87 E:0.063581 |  I would say it's going to be counter-attack game.
[8818.40 - 8821.40] P:1874.24 E:0.085654 |  I think Messi and Bappé are going to be the difference.
[8821.40 - 8824.40] P:1931.16 E:0.091076 |  I think Argentina are going to defend deep
[8824.40 - 8826.40] P:1762.62 E:0.078757 |  and then try counter-attack
[8826.40 - 8830.40] P:1744.52 E:0.083501 |  and France are going to catch them on the counter-attack.
[8830.40 - 8834.40] P:1700.93 E:0.075820 |  I want to say that France win just...
[8834.40 - 8836.40] P:1547.05 E:0.087563 |  I would say France could do with Rabiol back.
[8836.40 - 8837.40] P:1864.75 E:0.077787 |  Yes, I agree.
[8837.40 - 8840.40] P:1727.83 E:0.105481 |  I think they missed him tonight, as you suggested they might.
[8840.40 - 8841.40] P:1704.45 E:0.094759 |  Yeah, I agree.
[8841.40 - 8845.40] P:1978.14 E:0.095322 |  And then I think, I don't know if Argentina are the team that have changed the most tactically.
[8845.40 - 8847.40] P:1924.87 E:0.090538 |  They went for a back five, a back four.
[8847.40 - 8851.40] P:2018.87 E:0.096873 |  They played with four centre-off midfielders in the semifinal against Croatia.
[8851.40 - 8853.40] P:1946.98 E:0.095675 |  There's a lot of things that Scaloni can do,
[8853.40 - 8856.40] P:1743.23 E:0.098106 |  but in the end, whether he goes with a five or four at the back,
[8856.40 - 8859.40] P:1977.97 E:0.097071 |  whether he goes, whoever he picks, it will all be about Messi anyway.
[8859.40 - 8861.40] P:1963.23 E:0.085409 |  Yeah, Alvarez is in great form.
[8861.40 - 8863.40] P:1795.88 E:0.107017 |  De Paul is in good form, Enzo is in great form,
[8863.40 - 8865.40] P:1959.42 E:0.096968 |  but he's all down to Messi.
[8865.40 - 8870.40] P:1902.77 E:0.093229 |  And I think for the French, it would be done maybe not just to Killian, but a lot of it.
[8870.40 - 8874.40] P:1787.32 E:0.085622 |  And Griezmann would have a big role to play again, of course.
[8874.40 - 8876.40] P:1889.78 E:0.095876 |  I think he would be very, very tight.
[8876.40 - 8878.40] P:1787.42 E:0.077708 |  I think France will win it.
[8878.40 - 8880.40] P:1674.24 E:0.109456 |  Don't say that, no.
[8880.40 - 8882.40] P:1657.22 E:0.107976 |  No, don't say that, no.
[8882.40 - 8884.40] P:1826.01 E:0.095457 |  That would make them favourites then.
[8884.40 - 8886.40] P:1880.47 E:0.091964 |  No, you can't win without being the favourite.
[8886.40 - 8888.40] P:1783.80 E:0.081914 |  You can, you can.
[8888.40 - 8892.40] P:1850.71 E:0.093706 |  Johnny's right, Chris, in that they will need Rabio for that game,
[8892.40 - 8896.40] P:1834.21 E:0.073999 |  given the intensity of the Argentinian midfield.
[8896.40 - 8897.40] P:1625.54 E:0.110480 |  Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[8897.40 - 8900.40] P:1616.85 E:0.076524 |  I think he was a big miss this evening.
[8900.40 - 8902.40] P:1750.85 E:0.069648 |  I think they're...
[8902.40 - 8904.40] P:1531.57 E:0.105676 |  I'm trying to work out how this final will pan out,
[8904.40 - 8909.40] P:1618.86 E:0.087938 |  because they're both teams who don't really want the ball,
[8909.40 - 8915.40] P:1676.51 E:0.078685 |  and who have picked their moments in this competition.
[8915.40 - 8919.40] P:1770.63 E:0.105921 |  I actually think it's going to be a really feisty final,
[8919.40 - 8922.40] P:1730.06 E:0.095016 |  because just with the nature of the way the Argentinians have,
[8922.40 - 8924.40] P:1537.17 E:0.102848 |  since they got beaten by Saudi Arabia,
[8924.40 - 8928.40] P:1642.55 E:0.101257 |  they've been really fired up and been on the edge.
[8928.40 - 8931.40] P:1636.93 E:0.084999 |  And I think the French will respond to that.
[8931.40 - 8936.40] P:1707.17 E:0.078786 |  But I don't think it's going to be a classic football match.
[8936.40 - 8938.40] P:1445.61 E:0.094452 |  Kazan, I think, in the cooking pot with that,
[8938.40 - 8941.40] P:1767.55 E:0.088437 |  when the French beat Argentina 4-3,
[8941.40 - 8943.40] P:1654.74 E:0.101820 |  which was a brilliant game,
[8943.40 - 8945.40] P:1670.68 E:0.083909 |  I think it'll be a different type of game,
[8945.40 - 8947.40] P:1669.73 E:0.088405 |  maybe not a brilliant watch,
[8947.40 - 8949.40] P:1732.94 E:0.078494 |  but like Micah said,
[8949.40 - 8953.40] P:1522.88 E:0.096990 |  who's to say that it won't be a moment from Messi or Rimbabwe?
[8953.40 - 8955.40] P:1684.80 E:0.089605 |  That will probably end up deciding the game.
[8955.40 - 8957.40] P:1411.05 E:0.076642 |  Just to let us ask you, what is that happening with Camarvinga?
[8957.40 - 8959.40] P:1632.84 E:0.089011 |  Could you mention Rabio?
[8959.40 - 8961.40] P:1623.45 E:0.101773 |  And in no disrespect, a year ago,
[8961.40 - 8963.40] P:1792.02 E:0.089218 |  we wouldn't have even mentioned him Rabio,
[8963.40 - 8965.40] P:1802.21 E:0.104820 |  and now he must be saying that Camarvinga was the obvious choice
[8965.40 - 8967.40] P:1819.41 E:0.086295 |  within the last, say, six months.
[8967.40 - 8969.40] P:1713.01 E:0.083795 |  Last year in the Champions League game,
[8969.40 - 8972.40] P:1718.52 E:0.094697 |  against City, against Chelsea, against PSG,
[8972.40 - 8976.40] P:1724.78 E:0.087042 |  he was the one who came in and installed that energy in midfield,
[8976.40 - 8979.40] P:1620.63 E:0.094213 |  and now we're not even talking about Camarvinga.
[8979.40 - 8982.40] P:2015.35 E:0.099490 |  So I don't know if you saw him warming up a little bit in the first half.
[8982.40 - 8985.40] P:1940.44 E:0.096740 |  It was to come on for Theo a left back,
[8985.40 - 8988.40] P:1901.08 E:0.082898 |  because right now Camarvinga is the second left back.
[8988.40 - 8992.40] P:2048.79 E:0.088989 |  Deshaun doesn't think he's ready to play in these kind of games yet.
[8992.40 - 8994.40] P:1884.81 E:0.081113 |  He almost didn't make the squads.
[8994.40 - 8997.40] P:1835.20 E:0.100872 |  And now he turned him as a backup left back,
[8997.40 - 8999.40] P:2042.09 E:0.100895 |  which we saw against Tunisia, didn't really work out that much,
[8999.40 - 9001.40] P:2058.23 E:0.090393 |  but yeah, that's why he's not there.
[9001.40 - 9003.40] P:1972.78 E:0.075972 |  But Rabio has to be back.
[9003.40 - 9005.40] P:1973.85 E:0.111834 |  And Uppamecano, I thought Conati did well tonight.
[9005.40 - 9007.40] P:1864.03 E:0.072075 |  I think I prefer him.
[9007.40 - 9009.40] P:1925.93 E:0.094046 |  I don't know what Deshaun is going to do,
[9009.40 - 9011.40] P:2106.36 E:0.094824 |  but Rabio certainly, especially out of possession,
[9011.40 - 9013.40] P:1588.63 E:0.061956 |  he's so important for that team.
[9013.40 - 9017.40] P:1696.27 E:0.082053 |  And finally, Chris, if you take what happened last night,
[9017.40 - 9020.40] P:1791.63 E:0.077313 |  Croatia had control of that game for 20 minutes last night.
[9020.40 - 9022.40] P:1640.90 E:0.099259 |  Argentina hit them on the break, they win a penalty,
[9022.40 - 9024.40] P:1681.66 E:0.089538 |  they've hit them on the break for the second.
[9024.40 - 9028.40] P:1736.01 E:0.084813 |  So if France do end up having more possession in that final on Sunday,
[9028.40 - 9031.40] P:1614.38 E:0.074779 |  it's about making sure they don't get hit on the break, really.
[9031.40 - 9036.40] P:1568.87 E:0.087137 |  Yeah, but that's, I think both teams want to set up the same way.
[9036.40 - 9039.40] P:1561.47 E:0.084360 |  And I said, I'm quite happy not having the ball,
[9039.40 - 9043.40] P:1692.59 E:0.092899 |  so I mean, it'll be intriguing how it actually pans out,
[9043.40 - 9048.40] P:1718.90 E:0.081788 |  but it's going to be a game, both sides have gotten to this stage
[9048.40 - 9051.40] P:1684.98 E:0.095496 |  because of picking their moments within games,
[9051.40 - 9053.40] P:1778.76 E:0.091661 |  and it will be the same on Sunday.
[9053.40 - 9055.40] P:1339.88 E:0.076001 |  I've got no doubt about that.
[9055.40 - 9057.40] P:1683.12 E:0.087239 |  We've got more micro on the way with the match of the day,
[9057.40 - 9060.40] P:1767.62 E:0.087856 |  top 10 podcast final thought from you, John Murray,
[9060.40 - 9063.40] P:1667.80 E:0.084554 |  and what feels like a historic semi-final?
[9063.40 - 9065.40] P:1669.56 E:0.072608 |  Yeah, great occasion to be at.
[9065.40 - 9067.40] P:1672.10 E:0.098771 |  We will remember it, we'll remember it,
[9067.40 - 9070.40] P:1566.81 E:0.084918 |  because what Morocco have done at this World Cup,
[9070.40 - 9073.40] P:1708.67 E:0.084753 |  and as I say, odd World Cup, strange World Cup,
[9073.40 - 9075.40] P:1670.86 E:0.088092 |  that's what we've been saying throughout,
[9075.40 - 9080.40] P:1733.17 E:0.085554 |  but Morocco have certainly given us something to remember from 2022,
[9080.40 - 9082.40] P:1879.01 E:0.094175 |  and in the end, Argentina, France,
[9082.40 - 9087.40] P:1676.13 E:0.080801 |  that has got a proper World Cup final sound about it.
[9087.40 - 9091.40] P:1857.57 E:0.079476 |  John, Jules, Chris, thank you more micro on the way.
[9091.40 - 9094.40] P:1796.87 E:0.081870 |  It's the one with the greatest World Cup games.
[9094.40 - 9096.40] P:1699.93 E:0.068604 |  Is this a good one that's coming up?
[9096.40 - 9098.40] P:1820.06 E:0.045855 |  They're all good chapters.
[9098.40 - 9099.40] P:1875.41 E:0.060935 |  Of course they are.
[9099.40 - 9101.40] P:1742.11 E:0.064506 |  So, Gary Linnaker, Micah and Alan,
[9101.40 - 9104.40] P:1794.33 E:0.026159 |  after the BBC News with Matthew Bone at 9.31.
