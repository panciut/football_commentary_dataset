They will kick off England in their home kit. White shirts, navy shorts, white socks. The referee is the very experienced Harry Haagat from Norway. The stadium is open to the elements. But it's been a dry day in this beautiful city of Minsk. Chile this evening though, we're underway. And again, that, well, if it's only a draw for England, it won't be catastrophic. But the way England are beginning to shape up on the Capello, we rather hope they're going to win the game. It's the savage for Belarus. Back to the captain Kulchi and then as it's played for, it was cut out by Gerard. Gerard appears to have started on the left hand side. Yes, he certainly has. Barry sitting behind Lampard at the moment. It is a regular 4-4-2 for England with Rooney tucked behind Heskey. Belarus seeing plenty of the ball in his opening mini. Mini, minutes. It is getting nifty. It's played back by Filipenko to the goalkeeper, Shephnoff, who clatters it upfield. Headed back and over the halfway line by Upson. Now here's Gareth Barry. Barry rather shrugs off the ball though Barry trying to keep the session. Foul the player and it's a free kick to Belarus. And I think in the opening minute, two minutes of the game, we'll see that Belarus will pass the ball about. They're very comfortable on it and they keep passing in nice little short movements. In fact, before the game, Kepelo actually did say that they played he thought like Arsenal now. I thought well if they're doing, then they've got a game on their hands. And also they're missing Alexander Klev of course tonight. The Barcelona former Arsenal player has an ankle injury. He's the talismanic figure described as Maradona, Platini, Pele. He's highly rated by Brent Strang. Stanger. That's a wasted throw in. They'll buy on the young truck and it goes straight behind for a goal kick. By doing on the young tree is interesting for your game because he can play anywhere on the back for it. Yeah, but it's also very interesting because we've spoken about England's line up being on a 4-4-2 with Gareth on the left. Lastly, they're coming up against a 4-1-3 two formation and Belarus. They've got a holding defensive player playing in the holding midfield player. And then the three midfield players coming forward and they're two forward. So it's a different formation than England's 4-4-2. Here's the Parma player. Kudazov exchanges passes with Kulchi. Kudazov again, ball just over the halfway line. Hesky hustling the Belarusian into a mistake. And that's a good ball by Lampard to Rooney. Quickly on to Gareth and Gareth feeds it towards the left bank and Wayne Bridge. Bridge already midway inside the Belarus Haar. Back night of Barry. Barry being tightly marked and when he played the ball forward Barry, it wasn't accurate pass and Belarus have it back. Two and a half minutes played here in Minsk. Belarus still England little and of course will keep you bang up to date with what's happening with Wales or what's happening with Northern Ireland. He has played to back. Back night to David James. Give me one error in Saturday, David James. The ball just squeezed through time. And I think Mark Johnson was saying he tends to make an error a match. Hesky heads the goalkeeper's parents on. I heard of Bruny and threw two pitchers. Bitch harsh by Mark. He makes an error but I know what he means by it. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, other people have their opinions. I still think that he is the best goalkeeper in England, you know. And he's had a fantastic career. There's no doubt about it. David, sit. I'm going to say this right. I'll get it right later anyway. He's got possession at the moment. Kulchi to the left hand side. And now it's with Petia who's running infield towards the centre circle. Back night to Kudasov. Kudasov on night to Amoyanchuk. Amoyanchuk's passed forward. There's a foul tackler by Ubson. He didn't like the referee to sit. But it wasn't either foul on Sitko. So here's a free kick to Belarus. He's thrown at the game quite brightly. Naming the ball about very well, very quickly as well. It'd be interesting as the game progresses, whether they have any penetration to all of their passing movements. Now the free kick is at least 40 yards from goal, given the angle sort of inside right channel. And Mollosh, the left back has come across. Perhaps he'll take it left footed. I don't know your shoot from this range. But actually the way he's lining up. Yeah, here's Mollosh and it is a shot driven in left footed. And James picked the ball up just in front of him, aware that there were Belarusians around, should he make an error? He didn't. And it's very interesting there. When James got it, it was very quick to look for Walcott and get it out onto that right flank. Oh, good tackle by Heskey. Heskey on to Walcott. Ruining makes a break towards the near post. Fade in towards the United striker, but behind him. And it's clear to safety by Belarus. I'm just wondering there if there's been some instructions for David James and Walcott stays up front to get a quick early release from the keeper out to Walcott so they can break very quickly. Here's Ruining from the England throw it. And trying to find Walcott doesn't quite manage that. And Belarus have it back and it's played actually quite securely towards the halfway line to Kudas off. He's immediately tackled and England have the ball back. Now it's Brown to Gerard. Gerard sort of tucked in rather than wide in the left. Yes, he is. Yeah, what he says he'll play Gerard and Lampard, you know, whenever they fit. What he hasn't said is that he played them together and he hasn't done here. He's put Barry in there. And you wouldn't say at the moment that Barry is sitting, he's just playing a normal sort of centre left midfield role with Gerard further out on the left hand side. Now we've got an England free kick on the far side of the field, right in front of the group of England fans who made the long and difficult journey to mince. Lots and lots of crosses have sent George on that far side. Lampard takes the free kick, right footed, high in, headed on. But the flag is up for an infringement. I don't know whether it was Heskey or Upson. I'm not sure it's myself now. The referee said something's wrong and it's a free kick to Belarus. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, Graeme, in terms of atmosphere. I mean, yeah, it can be noisy, but there's plenty of space up there for the noise to go. It's not... I agree with you. It's hemmed in the England team tonight, on a stadium like this, on a pitch like this. Here's Upson having to track back and does the safety first thing, puts it by the play, and it will be a throw in to Belarus. Just to remind you, Germany playing Wales tonight, Colin McNamara's at that one, Northbound San Marino as Belarus come forward. That's at Windsor Park in Dennis, is there. And the Republic of Ireland are playing Cyprus. And our latest score for another game in this group, Croatia, I'm taking the lead against Andorra. Rakat... Rakatich. Rakatich. London pitches are right. Well, it's Croatia or Belarus or whoever. Not too many itches for England at the moment. They're very comfortable with their form. Here's Lampard, short of the halfway line, right of the centre circle. Kind of spot where Gerard has gone. Gerard's gone down the right flank, actually. Has Gerard got something of a free roll? Well, I mean, we've seen this before when he has apparently been played on the left-hand side. He's had licence to move and go all over the place. And I've said previously, that's hard to pick up. The problem is, if you then lose the ball, your team can have lost its shape. And so you have to be very careful on occasions. Here's Matthew Opsson. Gerard's still predominantly on the right side. Nice with the acting captain Ferdinand. Ferdinand plays it towards the right. It's headed away, picked up by Gerard, onto Wolcott. Wolcott easily beats the defender. Wolcott plays across in, long run he was there. Was he pulled back? I thought he was fouled. I think that could have been a penalty kick for England and the referee ignores. Yeah, there was no reaction by the referee or his assistants on the far part of the pitch, but certainly they looked at it, there was a little pull on rune as he went. Yeah, I thought rune was pulled back there and that should have been a penalty for England. But the referee was having none of it. It wasn't just rune who reacted, it was Heskey who was looking behind. I think that was a genuine hurt there. Good move involving Gerard and Wolcott in the cross into rune. Nice. Kulchi, captain for Belarus, not a good ball forward. Straight through to James. James throws it out to Lampar and now Barrett. And now here's Wes Bryan and Bryan drifts it towards Heskey. Heskey takes it into the chest. The referee's given a free kick for a foul, a barge on Heskey. Inside right channel for England. Lampar takes it. And I'm trying to pick out where Gerard's going now. And he's moving about, isn't he? There's no doubt about it that he's coming in, diagonally on a lot of occasions from that left hand side. Lampar's free kick, Heskey heads it on, but that's one bounce and behind for Wolcott. They're always going to bring up Ferdinand and Opsen. I think Opsen's actually very good in the air in those situations. And I think they found both against Croatia and Kazakhstan, you know, to get your big boys up and they're defending, the opposition's defending, Bunleys does, sometimes hasn't been the best. And who knows, that might be the case with Belarus tonight. Well, I hate to say it, but England's fans aren't the only ones treated to a ban. There's a ban trying to energise the Belarusian fans. It's just... Why don't they have that, you know, at the football ground? If the fans are passionate anyway, why don't they need a ban? Anyway, throw into England. And after a good, bright opening for Belarus, England, I've got rather more command of the game at the moment. Here's Bridge, on towards Heskey. Not a great ball from the Chelsea fullback, easily intercepted. And now here's Bulliga to the right-hand side. It's played in by the fullback. And here's good movement now by Kudasov, the parmer player, and then he runs the ball away and out he was possession. And it's cleared by England towards the right-hand side. It chase after by Wolcott. Wolcott couldn't get there first. The defender gets there and Belarus have it again on the halfway line. Drifted towards the left flank towards Bulliga. Across came Ferdinand, Bulliga trying to keep the ball in play. Can only hit it behind for a goal kick. There's no doubt in my mind that England have seen the case of getting early release of Wolcott when they can get him away. They're getting the ball either to him or for him. And it seems pretty obvious to me that this is one of the things, one of the main reasons he's well whilst Wolcott is in the side cos he has exceptional pace. Belarus lost to Ukraine, a very late goal, robbing them of a point, and then they won away to Andorra. They're a decent side, and they've shown that in the opening minutes, but there's a mistake. Rooney's after it, Rooney brilliant control. Gerard comes up, Gerards shoots into the net! Glorious goal by Stephen Gerard from 30 yards, magnificent England lead 1-0. Rooney's some great skill, some great touch of the ball. He's facing his own goal, really. Sees Gerard coming up to him from that left-hand side, typically on his right foot, and Gerard has bent it in from about 30 yards. He's done it deliberately, he's picked his spot. It's an absolutely first-class strike at goal, an excellent goal. Bent it in to the far post. It's 1-0 to England, what a wonderful start. Well, it was a passed shot, wasn't it? Brilliantly struck by Gerard. He knew precisely what he was doing. That wasn't hit in hope. That was deliberate. Yeah, he's bent it in, hasn't he? He's picked his spot round the keeper, and there's a Rooney to start with, control the ball extremely well. Well, what a great opening for England. And what a terrific goal by Stephen Gerard. The 14th he scored in England colours, and it's ironic last week in the chat was about Gerard, can Gerard play with Lampard, and he didn't have a good game in Saturday, Stephen Gerard. Well, that question, nobody asked more questions of Stephen Gerard than he does. He knew that he put in a below par performance, but he's responded terrifically well tonight. Here's Bridge playing it over the half-way line, where it's intercepted, and here's Petillo, Petillo into Kulchi, Kulchi just moving inside the centre circle. Well, if there's any dynamism from the Belarus fans, that goal will have snuffed it out. Well, we think it will have snuffed it out. We'll see. Belarus nil, England won, a goal by Stephen Gerard, an absolute peach. At the moment, you know, from Belarus, but they've had a lot of possession, they move the ball about comfortably, and they haven't looked at all as if they're going to breach that England back four at all. There's a lot of passing, a lot of movement by them, but very little end product so far. Can we tell how much they miss Mr. Kled? Well, you'd think so, would you, Grel, although he would even increase their passing even more to tell you the truth. Pesky heads on the clearance, Rooney heads it back to Pesky, and then it's a header away by the defender, and Belarus move sweetly towards the half-way line, and then that's not a good pass. Easily intercepted by Ferdinand, but his clearance runs straight to those in red again. Petillo playing it to the right plank, and Omeyantchuk, Omeyantchuk forward again, and now it's running by Petillo. Petillo, back and there's a long range shot driven in, David David almost built it. Good discretion, not only did he let it come off his chest, then when he put his hands on the ball it squirted through his hands, and luckily he managed eventually to gain control of the shot. I think he got in behind the ball and he needed to get that, cos that ball certainly dipped in very much in the last few seconds. Gerard Dehesky, Gerard again, another shot, and this one's inches wide of the right hand upright. Going end to end at the moment Alan, aren't we there with a long shot from Belarus coming in that James failed to collect, and then immediately at the end Gerard comes in on that right foot coming in from that left side of the pitch. Now Capallo, that's at the moment talking to David James, and quite know what about it. It's a long way between coach and goalkeeper, good 50 yards and how much you can communicate with sign language. I don't think it was criticism of what happened. No, no. It's something else, and perhaps in terms of how he's distributing possession from the back. Well, that was just a worrying moment for England, and particularly for David James, but England lead 1-0, and we played nearly a quarter of an hour here on five line in minutes. It's fed forward by Gareth Barry, but headed out of play by Sistaevich. When I thought there was an hour in his name, it was a lot easier to say earlier. Then when we took the hour right, suddenly I can't say it. Throwing goes to Rooney. Rooney's contribution to Gerard's goal was terrific. Lampard hits it away to the right side towards Walcott, and Brian was caught there. It was a lazy pass back by Walcott. Belarus on the attack. Good run down the left flank. The cross wasn't great. Should have been intercepted by Barry. Wasn't, luckily enough, Bridge with there. Bridge finds Brian, and Brian hits it upfield towards Rooney. Rooney slips and can't get possession halfway like. Cleared by Bridge again. Into the Belarus half, and again, Capello's out there, shedding instructions. Still trying to find out where Steven Gerard's playing. I've got a much freeroll that I imagine he has. Here's Bulliga. To the left flank. And Sitko. Sitko back now to Patio. Patio about 35 yards from goal. To Kudizov. Back to the captain, Kulchi. Kulchi looking to play a one-two, didn't come off. Despite the fact that Belarus fans seem to think the referee should be blowing their whistle. Blowing his whistle even. Kulchi again. Middle of the England half. Plays it right, but it quite deliberately, but it was so deliberate it was telegraphed in effect. And Bridge could head it away to safety. They are a short passing side. There's no doubt about them, Belarus. They don't, you know, they look to keep the ball within their team. A lot of passing. Quite a lot of movement as well, but they are passing his 5, 10 yards, no more than that. Steven Gerrard's goal has put England in front here in Minsk against Belarus. It's with Belarus at the moment. On the half way line. With Molloch, the left back. They play it very patiently. They are sort of mini version of Arsenal. They won't be hurried. That's a good ball fed to Molloch again. Cut forward now. They are going in James Fulton again. That wasn't quite as urgent, but it looked like a soft shot that he should have plucked 100 times out of 101. I thought it was an early shot Alan. Good pass into Heskey. Heskey just offside. I think it was a very early shot by them and took David James by surprise. I don't think so much it was the power of it. I think it was that he took it so early and so quickly. And it almost caught him off guard. David James is a very confident goalkeeper. It doesn't matter how narrow it is. It doesn't let it get to him. I just want him to dismiss those couple of incidents. It's going to have to be. The point I was making when I said the best goalkeeper in England was talking about the best English goalkeeper. The best that we've got. Here comes Stas Ervich. That's lazy play from the midfield. David James is a very confident goalkeeper. He's a very confident goalkeeper. He's a very confident goalkeeper. But that's lazy play from the midfield player. It's cleared away. It wasn't a good ball by Upson. Well ahead of Barry and out it goes for a throw in which Kultje the Belarus captain will take. Stas Ervich again. Kultje wants more. Just a yard inside the England half plays it back to Filippenko. And Filippenko just 20 years of age. His pass forward intercepted by Lampard. Lampard trying to feed it back to Rooney. And then I think Rooney just stopped running. Lampard had anticipated that he wouldn't. And consequently the ball is through to the goalkeeper's shaft. 18 minutes play. You're seeing the 5 life sport on the BBC. Belarus nil. England won. And if you get near television set later, I don't want you to deny, if you get near television set later, look out for Gerard's goal. Excellent. Briggs that's a good ball to Gerard. And then the pass from Gerard though. Gay possession away far too easily. Kultje to the left hand side in Sitko. Into Kultje again. 25 yards from goal. Looking to feed it back and the shot driven in by Kutters off. And again James had to make the save. This time the ball never stopped from his grasp. They got down very well to it. I have to say this as well. We're early I was saying there's no end product. They've now had three or four shots from the edge of the box. And they've moved the ball about very well. They've made a promising side. Well they've had some excellent results as Mike was saying. You know before kick off who draws against Germany. And against Argentina. Interesting thing Alan as well. Kultje is apparently playing a holding role. He's been involved in a left of play in the... Heskey for England. Back to Lampard. And now to Ferdinand. David James. Surface looks pretty good doesn't it? When I first thought I wondered if it looked a little bit long but nobody's having any problems at all. And it is very important to get a good surface. Particularly when you come to away games. There's a good pass by Ferdinand to Heskey down the right flank. The big man holds it up. Then he plays it back. Here's Lampard. Excellent pass by Lampard. Just drifting it from right to left. Finds Bridge on to Gerard. Gerard almost lost possession there. Still find Bridge back to Gerard. On to Bridge. This is good football. Bridge with the crossing. Throws the edge of the penalty here. Clear it on the half volley. And now here's Bulliga. Bulliga the one proper striker. Playing it back and quickly forward to Kudizov. Bulliga is now furthest forward again. He's just set his own penalty here a few seconds ago. Sit go. Playing it to the left hand side. But Wolk had a track back and that's a mistake by Wolk. He should have cleared the ball. Crossed in the England penalty area. Headed away by Ferdinand. Bulliga tackle. Ball breaks to Rooney and Rooney can head it towards Heskey in the halfway line. Heskey was trying very hard to feed it towards the right towards Wolk but couldn't quite get the pass on. And Belarus have it again. They've come back well since England scored. I think they've played very well to tell you particularly going that goal down to Bat-Tackle. Right. Who? And there's a yellow card. But more to the point, who's the England third eye? Not quite. Is it Lampard? Yep. He's getting up for it, certainly. Creature two. Andorraniel, Ollich has got the second goal. Well, you could assume they were going to get three points at home goal and door. Yes. But remember they dropped two points at the weekend. That was a very nice draw for England. It was a great new creation. It was always good. You know, you can only look after your own results but then when a couple of the other results go for you, it was a nice result. It does help. Now, Bridge almost got himself in trouble there. Andorraniel, Ollich, Kohl. But he managed to retrieve his own mistake and I've burdened it. Lift the clearance high towards Heskey. Heskey jumped. Didn't make contact with the ball. Runny's frustrated that the ball didn't go in his direction. I think one of the problems Wainbridge has when he's getting possession is with Steve and Gerard moving from that left leg. He doesn't always have somebody outside on him in the line. So his options of passing, they just cut down a little bit. You know, unless Gerard were to stay there, which none of us wanted to do, then when Bridge has the ball, he has less options as to who and where to pass to. Mr Sasevich, which foul tackled there by Bridge. And here's a free kick to Belarus. It's won by five places in from the right touch line. Halfway inside England half and played quickly by Petitjo, he's the captain at Kulchi. Just chipping the ball into the penalty. James Kane. There was no shot there. Burdened head of the ball away and England were lucky there again. Just a minor scar. So we're midway through the first half. England lead, but it's not that comfortable a lead. Here's my king. Well, I know that Fabio Capello particularly admired Belarus's counter attacking ability. And they have shown quite a bit of that so far. Enough certainly to disturb England, but they lead through Gerard's terrific goal. But here come Belarus again playing it through midfield and now with the full back near side. Omo Jan Cuk. Sasevich on the right hand side. Now Omo Jan Cuk again. They're building up slowly down this near side. They work the ball in and they still have possibilities in the penalty area. Out comes David James diving at the feet of the two soft. And the danger is averted, but they quite a bit of flair when they go forward. They have the movement about very well. Like they're good to watch. They're pleasing to the eye. They've had two or three shots from the edge of the box. But you feel that there's always a chance they could open England up. Mistake at the back almost there by Belarus, nearly letting in Emil Hesky. Emil Hesky by the way is winning his 50th cap tonight. Hasn't scored for England for five years. Stephen Gerard's winning his 70th cap. And he has the goal which divides the two sides here in Minsk. Chile evening in the capital of Belarus, but England at the moment looking good. Omol Jan Chuk the full back when Belarus beat England at Reading, the England B team before the last World Cup. Omol Jan Chuk was sent off in that match. And now Belarus bringing the ball forward through one of their centre backs. Vakotsov, the fast side of the field. England having to retreat once more. Belarus come forward. It should be cleared now by Wayne Bridge. Gerard can't control it and Belarus have possibilities once more in midfield. Lampard comes into win the ball and Gareth Barry. That was a foul by Barry, but the referee's played an advantage. He may well speak to Barry when the game next stops. Omol Jan Chuk dangerously into the area. Katoosofo doesn't get hold of it. It's gone wide. Let's see if the referee speaks to Gareth Barry. No, he doesn't. It's a goal kick to him. Just hearing that Robbie Keane has scored to the Republic of Ireland. Republic of Ireland won Cyprus NIL. Belarus are moving this ball about very well. England a one nil up to a very good goal from Stephen Gerard. But they cannot rest on their laurels. This looks like a good improving side. And certainly their combination plays excellent. At the moment they haven't really got right through the England defence. But they look as if they're capable of doing that. One of two of the England players not getting into the game either. Haven't seen very much of Frank Lampard yet. And certainly haven't seen very much of Theo Wolcott. It's a free kick. Rooney's getting a little bit annoyed once more. Norwegian referee's given the free kick. They're playing Belarus. And there was a poor pass out of defence up to the half way line. England knock it back again. That was a harry clearance by Upson. But Gerard jumps and wins it. And now Rooney takes on the defender near side the field. Rooney with a flick into midfield. Lampard gets there first. Lampard turns and plays it to the right. Brown's got it. Wolcott's waiting. But then Brown hit it straight at one of the Belarus players. And England are back inside their own half once more. Belarus nil England won and you're listening to Five Live. It's Wayne Bridge or Bridgie as Fabio Cappello called him yesterday. I thought we had the end of the JTs and the Stevie Gs. But we've got Bridgie at left back and now we've got Heskey on the ball for England. Turning well on the edge of the area. Emil Heskey turning left, turning right. Now on the edge of the penalty area. Slides it into the far post. Rooney's jumping for it. And almost got there as well at the far post. Two defenders were trying to take care of Rooney. He just couldn't quite squeeze the header back. And it's a goal kick to Belarus. And what we've seen there is what we saw in both the games against Croatia and Kazakhstan is that you know, Heskey is a problem. He's a big man. He holds it well. He's extremely well there. And defensively, you know, you look at Belarus now. Defensively, they don't look the strongest. It's almost 10 o'clock in the evening here in Belarus in central Europe. As the home side have the ball once more. Ever on the far side, Mollash the full back. Plays it back into the centre circle. You can hear the England fans now over on the far side. A couple of thousand of them certainly. In goes the England right back, Wes Brown. But he hasn't won the ball. But he pushes sick co-back quite well. And Belarus forced to go back almost to the half way line. Now they knock it to this near side and the full back. Omo Janjok once more. Stas Javic down the right cuts in from this near touch line. Stas Javic into Kochi. Belarus building on the edge of the England penalty area. It's Kochi once more. But England are holding them on the edge of that area. Belarus once more. A lovely zigzaggy run. And they shot, no, not coming yet. Now it's leper to the far post. And it's a goal for Belarus. And it's headed in by sick co-back. It was a great ball in. Lefordin from Stas Javic. England didn't pick up sick co-back at the far post. And that goal has been coming. Belarus won England one. I have to say this. It's the first class goal. The build up play. The opening up play was excellent. And Stas Javic actually he stepped back. Saw the man at the far post. And delivered a perfect cross. I mean we were saying could they open up the England defence. And they certainly have done. I don't know why but the referee has just cautioned David James. I'm not certain as to why that was the case. But that was a really good goal. By Belarus. One-one. England had been warned about it. There's no question about that. Belarus was starting to get a lot of the ball in midfield. And Stas Javic did really welcome them down the right hand side. And then sick co-headed it. I think David James has been cautioned. Because he's booted the ball out of the, probably out in the stadium. And they've had to get another ball. And so that's why David James has been cautioned. But it was a good goal. You know it's no good to say this or that. It was very well worked by Belarus. Well it's the first time that sick co has scored for his country. This is only his fourth cap. And there's a real contrast as well in that central midfield area. England's three in the centre have 160 caps. Belarus's three players between them only have 18. But Belarus are backing the game here. They came back well of course against Germany. And they come back here against England. Wolcott has a chance to run with the ball down the far side. Trying to link with Wayne Rooney. Ball is out of play. England take the throw. So England having been given a great start here by Stephen Gerard. Now have to do it all over again. Bridge looking to play the ball down the line to Heskey. Heskey turns with Omo Janczuk and in the end has to settle for the throw in. And Wayne Bridge advances and prepares to take it. Bridge to Barry. One one. Barry gives the ball away. And Barry and Belarus have the possession once more. And they've given it back to the goalkeeper who had to be very quick with Rooney threatening. Onto the half way line. They are very dangerous on the counter attack here. And now it's Lampard getting away from his marker in midfield in towards Rooney who's given offside. And I'll frustrate the Manchester United striker even more. How comes the goalkeeper through Kixman giving? I thought he was just going to hold his run but you know the Belarusian defenders they had little choice to go for that through pass signalled offside. But I have to say this at Belarus I think since going that goal down to Gerard they've done exceptionally well there. There was no dropping of the head. They kept playing passing and moving. They're giving England all sorts of problems as well over on that far side. Breaking. They need wall-cotted England I think to come back and help out with Wes Brown down the right-hand side. We've been talking about England perhaps lacking balance down the left but there's a lot of danger coming down that other side of the field as well. I think you know wall-cotted has been asked to say out very wide as the wing is doing right out on the touchline. Well that's fine but the amount of possession that the opposition are having means he's got to get and took himself back in there. Throw to Belarus but they've overrun it. It's won-one here in Minsk and I need to borrow Alan Green's stopwatch to tell you how long we've played. We've played exactly half an hour and we've got a real game on now. There is, there's no doubt about it. I mean and from the kickoff time you could see with Belarus as I said very fewers know a great deal about them but they look a very capable side to me. James takes the kick. Eski can't get that one he just couldn't get off the ground at all. Barry's lost it in the air and here comes the counter-attack once more from the team wearing the red shirts and the green shorts. Belarus near side, ball skinned into the area and Ferdinand heads it away. He'll have to show all of his experience and quality other than these next 10-15 minutes. In goes Upson quickly to win the ball and now Barry, not much on for him. Barry, a hopeless pass though, could have held on to it a little longer. He played it to this near side. There was no way that Bridge was going to get it and it's a throw once more and out comes Javier Capello just making sort of calming gestures to his side. It's coming up into the technical areas they call standing there. One's coming up but not a lot he can do at the moment with the way that Belarus commanding the game. Well Korshi, who really is the most experienced player just took a tumble there but he's OK. He's winning tonight his 73rd cap. He's the second most cap player in the history of Belarus football and he's only 7 away from the record. England building from inside their own half playing from right to left here in the first half in Minsk and a battle on for them now. It's 1-1 having had a great start from Gerard Skal. Alan Green got it absolutely right. He really passed it almost into the net from distance to give England the lead. England haven't been able to build on it. Wolcott's not in the game and Belarus fully deserved to come back. As a header from Heskey was looking for Rooney the ball is played back to the Belarus goalkeeper and he just about gets it out of the penalty area and the clearance is completed by Molloch. Nice touches on the half way line. These two front players have a very good understanding for Belarus. England now look to Lampard. Hit quickly and high to the far side. Wolcott brings it down. Wolcott's falling into the area. Aim towards Heskey. Gerard's got it back again for England. Rooney stretches well on the edge of the area. Need some support here, Wayne Rooney. Rooney's looking for a bridge down the left. In the area it goes towards Lampard who gets in ahead of the Belarus defender. Now can Bridge cross this from the England left hand side. Takes it to the dead ball line and has to settle for the corner kick. A little bit better play by England there. They maintained possession of the ball for a longer period than they'd been able to do in the opening stages. And so Ferdinand and Upsen and Brown having had to do a fair amount of defending and now make their way into the penalty area to try and get on the end of this England corner kick. Into Heskey and that's headed wide. He got up well at the near post but headed it wide. I think that was a chance and there's no doubt about it. Putting the ball into the boxes we've seen in the games against Kazakhstan as against Croatia causes problems. The one thing I'd say against Belarus I'd be uncertain about their central defenders whether they can defend as well as they should be able to do at this level. But as a team they have created problems for England when they moved the ball about. 12 minutes to go in this lively first half here in Minsk. Belarus won, England won, Rooney on the half way line. Trying to release Walcott. It's just a little far in front of Walcott and the goalkeepers out quickly for Belarus to make the save. Let's just check on the game between Germany and Wales with Conor McNamara. 18.5 minutes played. Germany nil, Wales nil. Craig Bellamy went for a goal, directly on the kickoff. His shot from the centre circle was predictably well wide. That's the only time the ball has been anywhere near the German penalty area but Wales absorbing pressure well. Germany nil, Wales nil. Thank you very much here. England seem to be sort of wrong footed really by Strasievic. I thought he was going to get the cross in then he seemed to pull it back and then the delayed cross seemed to catch England off guard and in came Sick Cote ahead in at the far post. But on balance of play in the first half Belarus probably deserved to be level with England as they are here. Upsen takes a free kickoff, refiled by Heskey. Heskey trying to head it on to Rooney. Income the challenges from Belarus, committed and they win the ball back and it's dangerous every time they get it forward. Rio Ferdinand gets his foot in but back come Belarus once more and they are working it well through the centre and also from the flax and Belarus crossed the half way line and there's more for England to do here. It's the golf scorer Sick Cote. Sick Cote drives it straight at Gareth Barry wasted opportunity there for the home side now can England counter attack. Gerard has to be careful not to be caught in possession. Gives it back to Upsen who gives a safety first ball to west brown down the right and now Lampard picks up the possession. Lampard for England, short of the half way line. Lampard playing down the right hand side decides he can't go forward and gives it back to David James and inevitably gets a few boos from the home fans. James Clearance down the centre. Heskey and Rooney together but there's an offside given against England and we'll check on the Northern Ireland's progress against San Marino from Ian Dennis. It's played Northern Ireland Mil San Marino and it's been a scratch performance so far from Northern Ireland, lots of possession but four distribution in the final third O'Connor's header has dropped wide, Mil nil. Thank you very much indeed. Now there's a wild challenge on Emile Heskey by Omol Janshok. He was the player I said earlier who was sent off the last time the Belarus team played England in the game at Reading. Heskey's going to be okay I think but he can now get a number of players forward because Gerard has this. This is 30 yards away from the Belarus goal. Lampard's not very far away either and Gareth Barry, there's a little threesome there around the ball. Heskey and Rooney on the edge of the area. Ferdinand's gone forward too. Just the full backs are staying back. Capallo still stands down there. Won't be happy by the way that Belarus have come back into this game. England have the early initiative. Now it's 1-1 in Misk. Gerard has peeled away. Lampard drives it in and the goalkeeper who might have seen it late goes down to hold on to the ball. Yes, Chef Knopp in the Belarus goal did very well there because I think like you Mike you did see it late. He got down and collected it comfortably. Belarus won England one. And Catoosal who's been particularly impressive. He's been playing behind Bully Gar and he's been playing behind Bully Gar and he's got very clever feet and England have had a few problems picking him up. The ball is now back again with the England goalkeeper David James on a yellow card in this game. Heskey by the way is carrying a yellow card in this qualifying group if he was to get another one tonight. The next game by the way is not until the first of April at home to Ukraine. Ukraine and Croatia hoping for England to slip up here in Misk. Heskey heads the ball on. Gerard will try and get that down this near side and in the end it's a throw into England. Bridge steps forward. Gerard hands in the ball. Rooney and Heskey in the area. Walcott lurks just on the edge. Won one in Misk. We played now 37 minutes of the first half. It's bridged by the corner flag near side for England. Bridge with a porridge ball really into the penalty area which is easily cleared by Kilpenko and Lampard up some desperate for the ball to go out of play. Didn't. And now Ferdinand hits it high. England need to get Walcott more on the ball. Walcott's got it. Takes it initially with his head. Now he's taking on the fallback by the corner flag and England have a throw in by the corner flag over on the far side which is the England right. Really haven't had many opportunities for Walcott to run at the defenders here. Ball thrown back to Lampard who makes a mess of that. Now this is always the danger. When England lose possession, Belarus are very quick to counter but not on that occasion England have another throw in and Brown is there to take it for them. Rooney runs out of the penalty area. England throw in taken. The ball is lifted forward towards Rooney but it was a poor pass in the end from Garth Barry straight through to the goalkeeper. There's no doubt in my mind that Belarus are a very capable side. They've shown that by how they've played, how they've taken the ball to England and opened the moot. But on the same base I am a little bit suspicious about their defensive capabilities. And because of that I think there will always be an opportunity for England to get another goal. They're almost at their most dangerous Belarus when England have the ball because if England lose possession in midfield then Belarus get forward very quickly using the wide players particularly well and a throw in now to Belarus down this near side who obviously now are getting fantastic support from the home fans having come back into this game without headed equalizer from Sicko. Throw into Belarus England win it back again. They're almost at their most dangerous throw into Belarus England win it back again. Gerard they just lose their shape from it at England. Gerard trying to find Heskey. Heskey toes the ball on to Wolcott but I don't think Wolcott will get there. Out comes the goalkeeper in the nick of time and just manages to thrush it to safety over on the far side. Well certainly with the release of Wolcott and we've seen England trying to do that on a number of occasions in this half. On that time I thought that Wolcott would get there but the goalkeeper read it very well and just nicked it in front of him. One one here as Brown finds Rooney and the ball is behind Heskey. Belarus trying to clear. Graham Taylor would like to see England putting more pressure on this Belarus back for. Gerard's got the ball trading passes with Barry. Now bit of space for Ferdinand inside the centre circle. Suddenly a little bit better from England. Ball played into Rooney who comes to the defender. Rooney looking for Wolcott in the area. Wolcott's tapering the oh no he's not he can't take it past. Terrific defending on that occasion from Belarus. I thought Wolcott was going to run through there. And now this is the danger again. For England it's Belarus on the counter attack. Ferdinand's waiting for them though. Wolcott comes inside the fallback and he's on the charge again. Wolcott going forward for England. Wolcott shot it straight at the goalkeeper. Should have pulled it across the face. Rooney coming in looking very despondent there. Ball was pulled back across the face of the goal. But we have seen the threat of Wolcott. There's no doubt about it. Earlier Filipeko got a great tattle on him and brought it out to young central defender for Belarus. After Zagreb we have high expectations every time Wolcott's on the ball. Belarus won England one as we moved towards halftime. Four minutes to go in the first half here in Mints. England in front through Gerard. Terrific strike equaliser from Belarus from Sitko, header at the far post. England now looking to try and make a break in the Belarus half. But Belarus launch a high ball forward and it's given away by Gareth Barry. That was loose by England midfield but then given away by Belarus. And England take advantage. Brown now just inside the Belarus half. Trying to find Gerard. Brown's pass wasn't great. Rooney will try and win it back for England. The ball breaks away to the left. England appeal for a corner kick. But the goal kick is given to the man in yellow, Zevnoff. Goal kick to Belarus. And there's a fair amount for Fabio Capello to try and sort out at halftime here. There's no doubt about that as well. Because they say the controlled play of Belarus, controlled possession of the ball has been excellent. And they certainly know a disturbed England. This is the first time that Belarus have played at home in the group. Had a couple of away games. They actually were taken a long way in the match with Andorra. It was one-one until the later stages. Then Belarus won it three-one. And Anand was saying earlier that the defeat in Kiev was harsh on them. They lost to a penalty in added time at the end of the match from Shedchenko. One-one here in Belarus. Belarus working it through the defence. And the fair head for Kotsoff who gives it back once more to goalkeeper Zevnoff. Zevnoff right footed into the England half. It should be headed back by Upsen. Upsen's ball and a header from Lampard. Heskey and Lampard. And now Gerard. Gerard to Barry. Barry looking for Bridge. Here comes Wayne Bridge for England. Down the near side, a left. Rooney and Heskey on the edge of the area. And the ball from... Actually, I didn't think it was a great ball from Bridge but there was ball watching at the back there and they were hesitant and almost led in wall-cott but the ball breaks away for Golkin. But I think, Mike, if Belarus aren't careful that is what will let them down. I'm not certain about that back four. We saw it there. We're not the greatest of balls from Wayne Bridge in the air coming across. No Belarus player, no defender took responsibility for it. And I think that will create one or two chances for England. Graham Taylor, England's former manager with us here in Minsk tonight. For a very interesting game, Wangwan as Lampard now looks into getting more of the ball towards wall-cott. No, that's an instruction from Capello. Wall-cott down the right turning, needs some help here. There was no one to give it to. Belarus have won it back again. Gerard though trying to get England back in business and the end Belarus have to give it back to the keeper as Rooney comes charging in and now a high ball into the England half and it's the dangerous Strasievic. The man who supplied the cross for the goal. Free kick has been given against England inside the centre circle. Two Belarus, we've got a minute and a half of normal time to go in this first half. It's been a very interesting half, there's no doubt about that. I think it's about right the score line. Although Belarus have certainly had the greater possession and their movement and they've looked very, very comfortable on the ball. Fabio Capello will have concerns every time the home team have possession, every time they counterattack, they just wasted possession on that occasion and this would be a good time now for England to go in front. Gerard heads the ball forward and he's got a bang on the head as well. I think the defender is picking Gerard up. He's okay. Free kick has been given to England for the challenge on Stephen Gerard. So we have about 50 seconds of normal time to go, maybe a minute to be added on. England free kick taken short. It's Lampard at walking pace. Lampard forward to Heskey, typical Heskey control on the chest. Works his way towards the right. The ball bubbles back. Wolcott to Brown. England building slowly. Wes Brown now with a cross into the area. Doesn't reach Rooney. Heading away by the defender. Belarus now looking to get forward as quickly as they possibly can with Poteo. The man who's taken over from the injured Alexander Kleb in this Belarus side. But they haven't missed him greatly in this first half. His very young central threesome they have in midfield. He's very young central threesome they have in midfield. Central threesome they have in midfield. Doing well for the home side. Up against the experienced Lampard and Gerard and Barry. Now Barry slides the ball back into his own half. Upsome with a big up and under towards Rooney. Flag has gone up again. Might have been Heskey I think who's straight off side. We've got one minute of added time and the scoreline here is one all. I think that Capella will want to see this come out. Get into the team, into the second half. Explain very much what he wants, what he requires from it. He's going to be a good player. He's going to be a good player. He's going to be a good player. It seems that whenever they can try to get Walka to away, they're looking to do that. But sometimes you know you can just get a little bit one sided about that. Well he's certainly got at them at half time against Kazakhstan. Let's hope he has the same effect here tonight. In the meantime we're going back to the Northern Ireland game and Ian Dennis. And Northern Ireland have taken the lead on the half hour. David Healy scored 13 goals in qualifying for Euro 2008. And he's up and running here breaking the deadlock. One nil Northern Ireland. Thank you, remember. Republic of Ireland won Cyprus nil, Robbie Keane and it's still Germany nil, Wales nil. More on those games coming literally in a few seconds time because it's almost half time here in Minsk. It's been a very enjoyable first half. And there goes the whistle from the Norwegian referee. Plenty, plenty for England to think about here. They went in front through a dream of a goal from Steven Gerrard on his 70th appearance. But Belarus were always looking dangerous on the counterattack and they deservedly got back into it with a header from Sinko. So they got back into it with a header from Sinko. So they got back into it with a header from Sinko. So the half time score here with a fair amount for Fabio Capello to Ponda. Belarus won England one. Thank you Mike. Graham, what does Capello do? Well, I think first of all, he's got to make it quite clear that to lose possession against this side carelessly, they will break at you very quickly. The England players will know that by now. They will know that they're in a game. The other thing if you're talking about when it, yes, we can see we're trying to release Walcott on many occasions and there is absolutely nothing that we can do about it. We can see that they're in a game. We've seen that on many occasions and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that at all. But I know this sounds strange. Some old fashioned sometimes crossing with Heskey being dominated there. Getting the ball wide and getting the crosses is because I've seen it against both Croatia and Kazakhstan and I suspect this against Belarus. I don't think they're good at defending those kind of crosses and we've seen that on a couple of occasions when the ball has been crossed in to Heskey and the Belarusian defenders have been somewhat confused as to who should take responsibility. Great goal from Stephen Gerard. Slick move though from Belarus to the equaliser. Oh, definitely. First of all Gerard's goal as Alan Green said passed into the net from 31. Bent it round the keeper. Some very good ball control by Rooney early to that. But the Belarusian goal was excellent. You know there was some great combination play and some great play by Stozovic and he then bent it in to be headed in at the far post. It was a very very good team goal. Well, a little piece of information was given to me by Clive Tillsley. 23 passes for that Belarus goal. 23 passes, that is remarkable. And I've got to say even though I don't like anybody scoring against England, I applauded the goal. Actually what two great goals tonight. Very different goals. So England better stay awake at the start of the second half. I'll run down the teams and just to mark the fact I'll get the England team out of the way now because the referee is still getting instruction from television presumably. Goalkeeper James defender is Brian Fernand-Ubsen and Bridge. Midfielder, Walkott Lampard, Barry and Gerard. Then Rooney who I think has been outstanding and Heskut. The referee Terry Harger from Norway blows his whistle under way one one remember the start of the second half. That was a lunging challenge on Walkott and that's certainly a free kick against Belarus. Whose lineup is as follows. Goalkeeper Shevnoff defenders Amilyan Chuk, Filipenko for Kotsov and Moloch. Then Kulshi the captain is a holding midfielder player ahead of him, Cecevich Petiyo who picked up a yellow card like David James in the first half and Sitko the goal scorer. Then Kudasov very clever player and finally Bulliga. But I say very clever player. Graeme there multiple clever players in that Belarus side. I think they've been very impressive in the first half and it's come back from the goal down was very good. As I say no heads went down at all but a combination plays very good. Well done Walkott. Well just as I say well done Walkott. He got past two defenders then he missed control of all and squirts behind for a goal kick. Just a little bit too quick for himself there I think. I think that sometimes when you are very very quick you sometimes need to mentally slow down. I think that's something that you know he will learn as he gets older in terms of mentally just slowing himself down. Here's Moloch the left back and it goes to Petiyo flick down but only to those in white England white shirts Navy shorts white socks Belarus red shirts otherwise adorned in green. Here's Ubson to the far side and bridge not a great ball forward by bridge clattered back by on the young truck towards the England penalty area and Ubson just hooks it out of play. Do you think we look a little bit vulnerable at full back? Well I have to say this in defence of bridge a little bit and the case was there Stephen Jarrod with him not staying wide on the left and wondering when bridge gets the ball he has no option of passing the ball wide so he's either got an inside pass if it's not if it's not there he's only got a forward pass. Jarrod trying to win the ball back Hessey put a foot in his whirl and he contacted the player so it's a free kick awarded by the Norwegian referee to Belarus. Two minutes gone in the second half this is five live football on the BBC Belarus won England won and Belarus thoroughly deserved equalised. They responded so well to that marvellous goal scored by Jarrod they responded with an equally marvellous goal 23 passes before Sit goes header Hessey was being pulled back England still have the ball lovely pass by Lampard on the runy runy with Jarrod ahead of him runy still going great move by runy the shot was limp and it's easily saved he just couldn't get the ball from out of his feet the tremendous run like UL and I think he's looked very lively runy tonight even though Jarrod goes excessively his control was excellent just reminding Northern Ireland to San Marino NIL that's at Windsor Park Wales drawing NIL NIL in Germany but the Republic of Ireland won up against Cyprus and when last I heard it was gracious to Andorra NIL now one of the creation players is down injured that's why the goalkeeper wallied the ball out of play so he can receive attention is that Kudasov? no it's Poteo he's limping away haven't they been impressive I think the thing is that the short passing game and the way they move it you can understand why Capello said earlier they play like Arsenal short passing and movement lots of little clubs out there except for the Bain ones little legs there they're terrific really impressed with Belarus I'm at the city of Minsk I got in this morning and the driver from the airport what a beautiful looking city it's very very nice no play resumes the ball played down the England left flank and then it's cleared securely by Upson but the flag is up for offside against Emil Heskey Runeon Heskey working very hard you would expect that from them yes but if you look just as it now you see where Gerard is he's very central on Heskey as well so there's no doubt about it which makes it especially difficult for Wayne Bridge anyway the free kick is taken by Frikotsov not too well taken Brian heads it away Upson heads it further away but Belarus have it back they're right full back he's tackled ball breaks out of play it must hit him last because it's an England throw right in front of the England fans the far side of the pitch thrown quickly to Heskey good run by Runeon as well into the penalty area into Rune, great goal brilliantly set up by Emil Heskey and finished off by England's best players so far in the night Wayne Runeon and England are 2-1 in front 5 minutes into the second half some great play by Emil Heskey there he's got the ball wide on the left he's held players off he's beaten players all the time you could see Runeon in the middle unmarked and this is why I was saying early not one Belarus defender went to mark him cross came in by Heskey Runeon put it away so comfortably what I noticed they'll be very disappointed with their defending there but it puts England 2-1 in front well done Emil Heskey really and well done Wayne Runeon he's been making runs like that all night Wacott didn't pick him up once Lampard tried to find Wacott when he could have found Runeon and I'm glad he's got the goal I mean the combination of Heskey and Runeon it's very very threatening and we saw the result of it there today I think from Belarus' point of view they'd be very disappointed with their defending but I think of everything that is their weak point and it has to be said looking at how well Runeon Heskey play together even though I personally feel that Michael should be in the squad there's no way he could be in the team ahead of those two not the way they're playing at present time for England so England have regained the league now how will Belarus respond they responded terrifically going one nil down how will they feel about losing a goal so early in the second half and again it just quattens the crowd a bit apart from that infernal or maybe that's the Sheffield band in the far side of the field don't know England fans are cheering and dancing England lead Belarus by two goals to one and we're in the 52nd minute of the game David James slips as he finally cleared the ball Heskey takes it well on his chest plays it back to bridge bridge moves away and then crosses low and towards Runeon tried to feed it back to Stephen Gerard didn't get the pass quite right and it should be cleared by Belarus but it was wonderful again from Wayne Runeon very unlucky there his first touch to bring the ball down out of the air and then turn as he came round wasn't able just to get the strength on the ball and he would have set Stephen Gerard up for an opportunity to score England's third well Runeon earlier in the season was a pale shadow of the man he's been in in recent games from Manchester United and for England he's absolutely bang on form here's Lampard England's search for a third goal that truly would kill off Belarus play to the left side and Heskey back to Gerard and Gerard spots Brown down the right flank and Mark plays it two ways Brown Barry's available but Brown plays it back to Ferdinand and on to Lampard and suddenly England looking command of the game they do and you can only say straight after half time then Capello the manager has to be given some credit because he's obviously said something and adjusted something and put things into the players minds and they've come out and they've looked very purposeful since the kickoff of the second half I love managers who make things happen you know, good point in waiting to 75 minutes you see something wrong at half time get it right free kick for a foul on Heskey it's a couple of feet in from the left touch line Gerard's going to take it Ferdinand Upsen inside the penalty played deep looking for Upsen who heads it on just ahead of Amiel Heskey and the goalkeeper Shevno has it and he throws it out straight out of play and he apologizes to Kudizov who was the target England throwing on the half way line Brent Stanger patrolling that technical area Greyhurd man and vast experience and some but brilliant I was talking about the great work he did in a racky football and he's obviously producing a very good Belarus team they may now struggle to claw another goal back against England yes, I mean they've got to sort of react as they did when they went to one goal down in the first half and they came back at England but once again we've seen otherwise that sometimes the tiredness creeps in probably the fitness and the physical condition of the England players could be their advantage there was a poor ball by Barry there and then I think Sipco the Belarusian goal score was filed but the referee allowed play to continue Belarus still have the ball it would be interesting to see if he takes any action it's head out of play and then his colleague hadn't realised he got to his feet he put the ball out of play so Sipco lay down again or he sat down again captain Colty looked round I think it was a collision with Rooney and Rooney goes and shakes his hand just to make sure the referee doesn't think of doing anything else anyway we'd all rather see a Wayne Rooney like that wouldn't we in all honesty he bit once or twice at the referee early on but since then he hasn't done I know people say it's fiery it's in his temperament but the more he can stay often away from referees I think that helps his game but he's got a great football brain Wayne Rooney and he won't feel frustration tonight he must know how well he's playing and the score as well terrific throw into Belarus on the far side of the field throw to Buliga and now it's back on the half way line on the Yanchuk exchanges passes with the colleague and then he gives the ball away wall caught then round forward there must be a sneaky little handball there by Kudasov gets away with it that might have been a yellow card anywhere to free kick to wienland played quickly, Brian back to Ferdinand and on to Upson Upson hits it to the left flank towards bridge Rooney's down that flank, Gerard's in a central position it's as if Rooney and Gerard are switching what I have to say though there's a prime example there when Wayne Bridge got the ball he only had one option and that was to find Rooney up front there was no other option for him at all I feel a bit of sympathy for him Alan sometimes when he gets the ball there sorry Graeme, Lampard just headed the ball in the direction of wall caught but ahead of the Arsenal play so it's out for a throw in to Belarus I've really enjoyed the game you know it's been a good game you know and the argument these days that there are no minu's well there are one or two we know but Belarus just emphasising that a so-called small nation can produce a really good football team and this is a difficult game for England tonight no, it's with the full back Molloch the left full back he plays it forward then there's a foul by Brian and that's going to be a free kick to Belarus and some whistles from the crowd brilliantly bright floodlights huge towers of floodlights enlighten the stadium otherwise it's pitch black and you do get the feeling such as the chill in the air there's another one or two down the line and it'll be a nippy place to spend an evening I'm not so certain it'll be the place to come then just looking at this I've just got the feeling you know that physically when I spoke about fitness wise as well I just think that England will have more than an edge here as this game progresses Rooney leaves the ball for Gerard back to Lampard, Lampard switches it towards the left flank bridge is down there the defender should have cut it out didn't bridge back to Barry Barry on to Heskey falls over wasn't followed on that occasion and now it's taken forward by Patio into the captain Kulchi in the centre circle and played down the left flank towards Sitko who headed them level at 11 he tried to find Vulligard didn't, Vulligard running in field not down the edge of the penalty area he made harmlessly for a goal kick miss understanding there thought the run was going to be made it wasn't but the pass had already gone but it was the first little indication of them getting a passing movement together Kulchi in this holding midfielder has had a lot of the ball the captain basically it's had no one to mark and so whenever he's had possession of the ball he's been able to start some good movements for Belarus a number of potential England substitutes warming up Pierre Crouch, David Beckerman won according to the official sheet Germain Defoe they left off the E Germain Defoe look at that I'm not going to try the Cyrillic version here's Rooney score of England's second goal to Lampard it wasn't a great lay off by Lampard towards Rooney again Belarus come forward now Kudasov with Vulligard in a prominent position Kudasov tried a clever pass didn't come off an England courtesy of Rooney managed to barz the ball towards the halfway line to at least temporary safety Filipenko leaving it now to Fatiha Fatiha on it goes to Kudasov and quickly to the right full back of a young chook and he's allowed to run forward here can he get a decent passing what a brilliant ball in towards Kulchi Kulchi was challenged by Wernbrunn who tracked the run and just physically Belarus captain off he went down hoping for a penalty referee was watching says no the referee got a clear view of that as well but there's a great run by Kulchi as I say he's nobody to market and he's been a big influence for Belarus what about the cross in term as well good cross technically they are so impressed with Belarus Gerard leaves it for Rooney really tried to pass it back to Gerard didn't come off and here's Petillo Kulchi not as young as the others mind Kulchi now Mollosh on to Vulliga then the left flank back to Mollosh that's good play Walcott was aware of the danger trying to get back there to impede the full back Walcott gets in a challenge and in fact he was fouled by Mollosh it's going to be a free kick to England good tracking there by Walcott and with the pace that he has it's going to be a very forceful back to get away from him how do you think Walcott has played tonight? so so I think he's having to learn all of the time the hat took against Croatia gives that expectancy level all of the time he's not going to do that every game but every now and again we know with the pace that he has he's an outlet for the England player as long as you don't overuse it it's expected to happen all the time gradually you hope that he'll come more and more with his own experience and he'll be more and more surprised when he can make a major effect on the game you won't be surprised if I'm misreading the situation but Arlingen really playing with one white player and Walcott and then and Gerard continually tucked in they're allowing Gerard to go wherever he wants to go you see him now he's in behind in that respect then Runy moves out a little bit wider to the left it doesn't go right out on the flank well unquestionably Gerard and Runy can play together here's a free kick to the Belarus he played 16 minutes in the second half Kulchi the captain the take-out, Heskey hasn't retreated to 10 yards still not 10 yards away Kulchi is patient looking for movement further upfield and then he just slides the ball through the centre circle to Filipenko Filipenko, oh that's a lovely dink pass on to Omelyanchuk Omelyanchuk down the right flank tackled by Wayne Runy Runy's worked harder than anybody tonight a referee I think has misjudged that and has given a free kick yes he's given it on the advice of his assistant which has taken the free kick and rather wasted balls back on the half way line now to Prakotsov Prakotsov to the left flank and Kulchi on it goes to Bullegar back to Prakotsov Prakotsov lifts the pass forward carefully headed away by Ferdinand but worryingly just the last couple of minutes Belarus have seen a lot more of the ball Mollosh infield with the pass to Sitko Sitko being hustled by Wes Brown back now to Kulchi and he just steps away from Emile Heskey isn't he a good player and now back now to Kudasov to Poteo it's not Poteo it's Stasayak the player is saying that I hate the crates because I can't do it just age, isn't it grand anyway he's farmed to free kick Kulchi is a good player 34 years of age showing all of his experience and they've taken the free kick Belarus England have to be careful here it is only 2-1 and this side has shown that not only are they tricky not only are they technically good they can't finish as well it's a brilliant move for their initial equalizer now outside of play and it's going to be a throw into Belarus we've played nearly 18 minutes in the second half do you think he might be thinking of a change here Capello I think Sean Wright Phillips is going on he's moving out, he's probably doing very similar and what happened against Kazakhstan some pace against them himself interesting though who he takes off I mean remember he brought Sean Wright Phillips on to play wide with Waukot wide and Jarod and Lampard in the middle here's Rooney blocking one attempted clearance couldn't block the second one and that's Potylo Potylo then lazy little pass to the left hand side and Bridge hits it up field towards Rooney, flags up for offside again seeing a lot of offside this lines one Capello talking to one of his assistants is that Pierce down there it is I wonder which language they're communicating in but no that's not physical, that's Gary Lewis wasn't sure trying to learn Italian he thought that was quicker than waiting for Fabio to learn English no down the left hand flank England on the attack ball just lazily played in that wasn't good and Belarus have it once more Filipenko to the right full back on the Janczuk on to Potylo Potylo beaten to the right side to Sasevich I know Kulci that's a good pass forward lovely football from Belarus and there's a man three in the middle Brian managed to get back though because the lofted pass didn't have enough weight in it to beat Brian and Brian made the interception here's Gerard on towards Heskey the pass over hit and it's through to the goalkeeper Shepinock just early in that if the Belarusian player had got his final pass in it would have opened up England totally on to David James they are a good side there's no question about that but here's Rune who scored in the second half early in the second half to Fittingen two one up and that's still the case with just 25 minutes left to play here on five live sport in the BBC Upset to Ferdinand plenty of time picks out Gerard looking for Walcott Walcott is going to chase after it goalkeeper out of his penalty area and wisely he doesn't try any fancy trick he's going to get rid of that just moving to Wales all the time and then let his side reorganise themselves Brian with a throw in back to Ferdinand Bridges available Ferdinand doesn't need Bridges at the moment instead he crosses high looking for Heskey Rune waits for the knock down Rune is after it takes it on his chest into the penalty area Rune with the control needs some movement played in but too far in well beyond Gerard he's not going to play himself doesn't he? his body lounge is just perfect doesn't matter how the ball is coming to him his first touch is excellent Belarus though they look frequently happy in possession on the attack again Gerard gets an attack the first challenge is actually made by Lampard that put off the Belarus player it's clear to the halfway line but the referee has blown his whistle for a free kick and here's a change Modrich has made it Croatia 3 and Doran 0 the change here is bringing Rodionov on and taking off have they got that right they're taking off Petio who's impressed me and John Wright thoughts will be coming on now for England who for well Rodionov is a striker Petio is much more of a central midfield player obviously Stanger feels he has to introduce something further up front trying to search for the second equalizer where's the fourth official goal he's gone to sit down and he doesn't realise he's got this is silly Capello is very frustrated about this so too is Ray Clemens what is going on can he not press the button twice he's actually sat down the fourth official and players resumed England have the ball down this flight he's sitting outside for a throw in and the fourth official still isn't ready it's a joke referee's looking across it's in because he's made plays, made play continue but there's some trouble down there isn't there now on England Benzer complaining bitterly towards the fourth official he's sat down is he on this planet here he comes and finally it's not the referee's fault but here we have the change and it's Sean Wright Phillips for Theo Walkock Alan Green to Mike Inge well that was really simple wasn't it Rodion off then comes on also for the home team he plays for Bate who did really well in that champions league game against Uventus but there are still one or two alarms here for England there are still a few holes that England aren't filling in midfield Barry at times struggling to come to terms in fact Lampard and Barry have been playing quite deep in this second half together allowing Gerard as Alan and Graham have been saying to get in behind Heskey and Rooney it's a quite an odd shape that England are playing at the moment but they have the lead and Rooney finds Gerard Gerard too many players from Belarus in front of him has to give the ball back to Barry Barry will work it to the far side of the field Bridge doesn't control the ball should have done and the back pass to the goalkeeper is cleared by Zevnoff England leading here by two goals to one twice they've managed to get themselves in front here Gerard first of all after 11 minutes an equaliser from a sick co after 28 and then Rooney giving England the lead right at the start of the second half five minutes into the second half and one of the big differences between this campaign and the last campaign so far Rooney remember missed many of the Euro qualifying games don't think he scored at all in the Euro qualifiers but he's now got four in three for Fabio Cappello England lead to one and Peter Crouch is also going to come on in a moment presumably for Emil Hescu's really worked hard tonight had to take quite a lot of stick as well in some of the tackling Belarus always dangerous when they go forward they build down this left hand side of the field with Mollosh Mollosh to the goalkeeper's sick co now the very clever Katoosoff and his striking partner Bulligar but Gerard wins it back strong all the referees penalising Stephen Jar but now England can make the second change Crouch steps forward wearing the number 18 and he will come on for Emil Hescu who's absolutely worked his socks off here tonight Graham and of course made the goal for Wayne Rooney I think Emil Hescu since his return to the England side has done extremely well and the combination of him and Rooney is very very threatening being able to bring Crouch on as well you know there's no doubt about it it doesn't matter what anybody says you get a big centre forward England of all nations know how to use them Hescu gets a deserved handshake from the UK as the dangerous Belarus side build once more on the edge of the area clever turn by Bulligar back pass from Ferdinand though swept down field by David James who's cleared the ball pretty well and it's been on his feet here this evening out comes the Belarus goalkeeper now and it's with the Kotsoff the defender the Kotsoff moves towards the half way line unchallenged yet by anyone in a white shirt gives the ball away though right Philips who's just come on for Walcott right Philips showing his pace immediately down this right hand side inviting the challenge from the fall back Mollosh and England win the throw in almost half way inside the Belarus half although Brown is going to take it from much further back just in front of Fabio Capello there's been a goal in Belfast Ian Dennis Northern Ireland 3, San Marino 0 that's what the goalkeeper was doing soft shot from Healy and the keeper just powered it into the path of Carl Lapety there is bad as the dog and duck San Marino Northern Ireland thank you very much one of the Belarus players has taken the ball straight in the face there from Wayne Rooney and he's dazed and confused so the game will have to restart but it does give Graham Taylor a chance just to give us his thoughts let me see again how long we got here Graham well I think that England just have to make sure they keep they wouldn't say the pressure but their own game just in shape as I call it to make sure they're not pulled all over the pitch and I think they've done well in the second half because you know come half time we saw Belarus performance one-one and you're thinking if they come out and play as they did in the first half then in fact England may be in trouble but they've really I think England have done well this second half and Belarus haven't been able to attack and have that movement and possession that they've had in the first half if you suspect Graham there could be a physical factor here as well bringing someone on like right Phillips is going to test them isn't it of course it is, just watching England against Croatia against Kazakhstan as the games progress the fitness of the England players in those two previous games and I suspect in this one is beginning to show Stas Javich was the player that got the ball in the face and he really has impressed us all here this evening made the goal he would scored by the way in that game against Juventus for Batte gave Batte a one-nil lead in that match which was eventually two-two the ball is back with Zevnoff in the home goal away to our right the crowd just a little quieter now long ball down field bridge jumping over on the far side of the field bridge still needs to come in again that looked like a hand ball for him here but the referee was happy and bridge slides the ball to this near side of the field right Phillips is there helps it back to Brown, Brown of England leading here by two one on five life and now Brown's just sky the ball out of play into the running track down there for a Belarus throw England have to concentrate here because they they change the ball very quickly they throw it back on again and England have to be alive we'll go to the Germany Wales game in a moment but now it's on the on the land chalk the right back down the Belarus right England mustn't allow Belarus too much possession back to Conomak Nomura watching Germany Wales. Germany nil, Wales nil John Toshak will be impressed with this Germany's frustration means that Wales are growing in confidence the home crowd has got restless the more Germany push forward the more gaps they leave at the back Wales have had three chances in the past few minutes the best of them for Bellamy he was denied by a super save from René Adler it's a really good game this Germany nil, Wales nil thank you Conomak, England missed the boat there they had a real opportunity when they got right Phillips and Gerard and Rooney forward but they just couldn't force it Rooney eventually had a shot which was blocked a nice turn now from right Phillips in between two of the Belarus defenders right Phillips and now Lampard steps in that was an opportunity for England to put this game because we feel here that if England get another one then that should be enough Belarus won England too on five life bridge now for England looking for Rooney to Gerard instead Rooney in the error Rooney for England and that must be it Rooney's done it again three one here tonight Rooney in amazing forms in this world qualifying campaign has now scored five in three England lead three one excellent play by England you talk about the passing movement it was there for all to see bridge came it in moved it in then there was combination play between Gerard and Rooney for Rooney to finish off so comfortably and so confidently Rooney you can see as we've mentioned a lot of times he's playing exceptionally well he looks happy he is happy he's every right to be happy because the way that he took that goal was absolutely first class well much relief and you know when you've got people like Rooney and Gerard in the team you've got half a chance haven't you you certainly have what's been interesting about Gerard for the last 10 to 15 minutes he hasn't played on that left side at all he's been central in behind Rooney and now Crouch originally Heskey but he's been much more cross central there's an interesting point to pick up on that when we get in a moment because we were talking at half time and we felt that Couchy was having too much of the ball too much influence nobody was pressurizing him I wonder whether that was intended by Capello to push Gerard in there and to really make Couchy have to do more defending because he was so influential in that first half now will Behrouz be able to respond once more no Lampard's won the ball Lampard is playing in a very disciplined role now he's having to curb his natural style isn't he and sit alongside Gareth Barry well I think they've done well as well it's like the second half against Kazakhstan where we play with two wide men in the second half and Gerard and Lampard stayed in there and now it's Barry and Lampard doing it and there have been moments also in this game when Rio Ferdinand's had to assert himself at the back there in the absence of John Terry and Ashley Cole holding it all together the England captain the England fans are singing Belarus won Croatia 4 and Oren 0 but the thing is Graeme if England can get the three points here size like Croatia and Ukraine are they going to have the problems there they're not going to find it easy to come here and get the wins there's no doubt Mike talking that Gerard is certainly playing in that hole behind Runey behind Crouch now and it means that to Couchy when he gets the ball has someone in and around him and if Capello has done that that is a good move because there is no doubt that Couchy was a very dominant and influential player for Belarus in the first half we certainly haven't seen so much of him this half Gerard has got the exactly the sort of role the sort of player that has always been too hot to handle for England over the years the player that just goes in behind the strikers difficult to pick up and Gerard is thriving but Runey is going to get the headlines again he got a goal against Croatia in Sargreb he got the two against Kazakhstan at the weekend although Fabio Capello thought he got three and two more tonight to build on Gerard's fantastic early strike Belarus won England three on five live it's a different atmosphere now as Gerard goes charging again forward down that left hand side whips it in with his right foot Crouch tries to get on the end of it Belarus don't clear Crouch once more has a possibility Belarus the referee's whistle's gone a challenge by Crouch he does tend to get penalized a lot in Europe Peter Crouch free kick to Belarus on the edge of their area I think he pulled the defender back there actually I agree with you you know when you're that size and what have you get some unfair free kicks given you that time I think the referee got it right because Crouch did pull the Belarus player back Strakhanovich by the way has come on for the very impressive Katoosov who plays in Italy with Palmer so England a little bit pleased to see the back of Katoosov England appear now to have this game under control with less than 15 minutes to go the ball is out of play on the far side and we're going back to belfast again and Ian Dennis Samarino down to 10 men Mike Northern Ireland still lead 3-0 but Mauro Morani lashed out at Michael O'Connor and has been sent off Northern Ireland 3 Samarino 0 thanks Ian so 2 against Andorra 4 against Croatia 5 against Kazakhstan and 3 against Belarus England are finding the back of the net so far in this qualifying campaign so important in this particular match to win if they could because you know this is the third of the 5 away games that England will have to play 4 out of the 10 so they're almost at the half-way stage already big one to come against Ukraine on the 1st of April but this is a very very good scoreline they've had a few wobbly moments but you get those away from home and the Belarus are a very good side and England are doing well here in the second half and we feel that perhaps Fabio Capello has made the right tactical switches once more identifying one of the main problems and putting Gerard in behind the strikers has really kept Kulchi quite occupied in this second half now the break is on once more and it's bully guard the number 7 slides the ball into the edge of the England area oh England getting in difficulties there with Lampard haven't cleared it yet but Dan goes David James to make the save that was just a little bit carefree in careless that England managed to survive there was a careless pass in the sense that Frank was facing his own goal and passed it square without looking and it was just a minor threat to England but David James collected it quite comfortably ball down field Crouch tries to get it Belarus back inside their own half play the ball into the centre circle nice little touches then they knock it forward looking for Rodionov and the challenge comes in this time from Wayne Bridge and it's gone back to David James David James takes one touch and then clears up to the half wayline 3-1 to England should be enough now surely with just over 10 minutes to go in this game which has been very very watchable indeed ball shovel down the Belarus right and they don't keep it in Rooney Graham is very clinical isn't he when he gets an opening in front of goal there's no doubt about that I mean he's played very well the last goal was an excellent goal it was a combination play as well between him and Gerard but you just knew that he was going to score and he picked the part of the net that he wanted to put it in he didn't just whack it he placed it in with a bit of power on the ball but it's been a good performance there's no doubt about it Gerard's move has helped the only thing I would say and I've said it a number of times for Bridge it does leave Bridge with so few options when he gets the ball and I feel some sympathy for him because he's got nothing to play out to at all Belarus won England 3 at the moment Rooney it's a bit like in the days when England had the likes of Shearer and his pomp and Linnaker I know when you see Rooney going through you're pretty confident that he's going to put it away and Rooney's now scored 19 times for his country this is his 48th appearance pre-kick given to Belarus but you just feel a little bit of the fight now and the belief I suppose has been out of my mind I mean it's one of those things they didn't really want half time to come when so many managers have said that before but I think they've run out of legs a little bit I don't think they're physically as fit as the England players England was still some defending to do that was a really important header intersection by Brown in the second half when they possibly had their best moment the home team Belarus and Brown too alongside Ferdinand has had a strong game tonight and now he prepares to throw the ball into the Belarus half crouch against the kovsov doesn't always get a lot of the headlines where's Brown but he's had a steady old game tonight at right back well you know I mean he's had his critics as well as in people say this and say that about him but he's come in he's took the right back position he's played centre back obviously this course for the odd occasional matches he's played it right back there and I think Capello doesn't like to change his back for and he's not all that concerned about full back bombing on you know I think he's quite happy to keep a solid back for in this group the last we heard I think it was 4-0 to Croatia against Andorra which is part of the course really Northern Ireland are leading 3-0 against the 10 men of San Marino Republic won up against Cyprus Robbie Keane's goal well what a result that Wales may get Germany nil Wales nil is still the latest score let's hope Wales can hang on I remember they took Russia all the way away from home and then lost to a late goal the ball now with Gareth Barry's had a more assured second half Barry moves the ball on to Gerard Gerard now to bridge in space down the left hand side crouch is calling for it in comes a cross from Bidge aim towards crouch headed away though by Belarus right Philips trying to get back on the end of it again for England and Belarus now look to clear once more good ball as well from Belarus but a poor touch there in midfield from one of their substitutes Strakanovich and England have possession again and Wayne Bridge who's also looked better in this second half but nothing like a 3-1 scoreline as opposed to give you more confidence Brown, Capello pointing Brown on his left foot this time in towards crouch crouch sideways header nice first touch from right Philips away goes Sean Wright's Phillips for England going past a couple of defenders goalkeeper manly oh the whistles gone the goalkeeper saved it anyway the referee's penalized right Philips I think on the edge of the Belarus penalty area yeah still both a good shot by Gerard and a good save because the goalkeeper wasn't aware of it and came across and just got his fingertips to the ball five live Belarus won England three this time next week Tuesday and Wednesday will be back in the Champions League for you remember England have a friendly match in Germany in November they hope to sort something out in February and a friendly but the next big game in this group isn't until the first of April Wayne Bridge of England 3-1 they lead one or two of the home fans now starting to leave and it is by the way 10 pass to 11 in the evening here two hours ahead of you Rooney battling farside has to be careful here Rooney there's no need now when everything's going for you in the game to run the risk of getting a yellow card I think it's time to get another update from Germany Wales Conor McNamara still Germany nil Wales nil and Wales giving themselves every chance of springing a surprise result here Gareth Bale looks like a young Ryan gigs down the left wing he's had jinking runs he's caused the Germans to change their right fullback Clemens Fritz has come on to try and keep tabs on him and the Germans just aren't creating enough chances they've got so much possession but Wayne Hennessy has not had to make any difficult saves Germany nil Wales nil thank you very much all the people leaving this stadium are going to miss David Beckham because we think he's coming on in a moment for cap number 107 which will put him just one behind Bobby Moore in terms of outfield players they're making mistakes now Belarus so another little cameo role to come maybe for David Beckham just over five minutes to go Belarus won England three Gerard first for England then Sikko with an equaliser for Belarus it's a half time that was certainly concerned amongst the England fans I would think because Belarus had played very very well but out came England in the second half sorted out by Fabio Capello and the second half has belonged to Wayne Rooney who's put away two opportunities the first made for him wonderfully well really by Emil Heskey on his fiftieth appearance for England it's interesting mate what he's saying even now you can see Gerard looking looking for colchi he's looking round for him it's been obvious that he's been brought in there not only to pose a threat himself but to get round colchi whenever the Belarus have the ball long ball downfield from James Rooney trying to get on the end of it headed away all into Gerard's path here comes Stephen Gerard for England round the goalkeeper on his hit the post that should have been four one oh Gerard how on earth did he miss that he's stormed through went round the keeper goal there and somehow Stephen Gerard contrives to miss what would have been his second goal of the night looked an absolute certain scorer should have been a scorer it now should be four one it remains three one well that's the old thing isn't it you know you put the ball in the net mentally and you've not taken care you've done it you know you're going to score and you haven't concentrated on that final touch being better if you'd taken it with his left foot out first I think but he flicked it with the outside his right foot he could see nothing else but him scoring and okay fine but I think the concentration just went at the last second well it would have been another four one score line away from home for England Beckham waiting patiently to come on back to Conor McNamara Germany Wales still Germany nil Wales nil but Wales have had a really good opportunity to score Craig Bellamy coming in forcing a save as a a shot from Swine's Tiger here goes wide what made us a good chance was that when Bellamy's shot was saved by the keeper Adler it spun up into the air and coming in like a train and then coming in to the penalty area Simon Davis was so close to getting in into the back of the net he didn't Germany nil Wales nil thank you England are finding a few gaps at the back now from Belarus Beckham comes on for Rooney who's not going to get a hat trick so Wayne Rooney another one he's not aware he's coming off now he is he shakes the hand of the referee he's had another storming game here he's made all the difference in the second half Beckham's applauding him tell you what it's a good job Graham it's not still one one I mean Gerard missing that one it may not matter too much no he'll have the mickey taken out of him for that miss when you win like that you know he'll be more concerned it says that he'll not like it it will be shown again but not in any way as short because the victory is there in the dressing room there will be a few comments it's called banter and so now all the way from Los Angeles California here in Minsk de Beckham corner kick to England lampard to take it Gerard desperate to get on the end of it header comes in good header as well it was from Matthew Upsen say by the goalkeeper back to Connor McNamara Germany won Wales nil Petr Trogovsky has finally broken the deadlock he turned David Edwards inside out on the edge of the penalty area it was a brilliant individual goal he rifled his shot beyond Wayne Hennessey and poor old Wales having done so well up until the final 18 minutes have finally conceded Germany won Wales nil well what a deep deep frustration that will be for everyone concerned with Wales taking Germany so far in that game Germany done it to many many sides over the years of course late stinging the tail for them we're going to have the younger brother Alexander Klebs younger brother the Akaslav Feb who's going to come on for all of about a minute and a half here in just a second England have the game won it's a very fine result this because if you've been with us from the start you'll know that Belarus technically have wanted to pretty gifted players and they'll be a handful for anybody in this qualifying campaign so this is a good win for England that's what it's all about isn't it just getting those three points 12 points from four games wonderful start to the group and a great way to win the year for Fabio Capello and the confidence will grow more and more ball with James in the England goal clears down field crouches there header on to try and find Gerard awkward bubble for the defender and because of that he's put it out of play and here comes the final change now with the Akaslav Kleb coming on to a man who's well had a great first half Stas Javitsch of Baty Borisov haven't seen as much of him in the second half and they as Graham Taylor intimated really in the end they have looked much more weary during the second half and he's not very tired and you saw that as he came off you know struggling to almost get off the pitch back to Belfast Ian Dennis it's fourth on Northern Ireland against San Marino the busy Steve Davis with a delightful flick latching on to Lapartis low cross Northern Ireland four San Marino nil thank you very much right Philips by the way has gone across to the left hand side four minutes of added time here we're going to be playing Beckham obviously playing down the right and he's got a good play line typical lampart shuffle on to Beckham Beckham holds it gives it back to Brown England three one lead bridge has the ball over on the far side the field bridge gets away from the defender easily bridge on to right Philips right Philips and bridge together down that left hand side the field the tackles go flying in from the home team England don't mind now that it's just a bit untidy over on the far side they are denying Belarus possession Belarus are not crossing the half way line runes gone off having scored the two goals Gerard should also scored two goals tonight only he knows really how he missed the fourth but it really isn't going to make a great deal of difference Brown of England to Beckham hugging the touch line near side Beckham made the run down the line but Brown doesn't return it to him instead it's gone to Gareth Barry much more steady in the second half and that's a lovely ball now from lampart of Gerard Gerard to release Beckham only crouch in the area Beckham to pull this one back to the far post just away from crouch diving header so a corner kick for England over on the far side the left and Beckham is already making his way over there I have to say looking at David Beckham chasing that ball I thought you ain't going to make it David the legs aren't going to get you there they did just in time he got the ball up in the air but unfortunately for Peter Crouch it's just a little bit too high there are Belarus fans clapping and applauding David Beckham as he goes across to the far side great ambassador for English football Beckham short corner back to Barry on the edge of the area it's back again with Beckham and England just retain the ball Gareth Barry England leading 3-1 Barry to Beckham on the left in comes a cross and the goalkeeper just about gather that one in and preparing to clear but it's all over now here the Belarus who gave absolutely everything before the break spectacular equaliser as Alan was saying apparently 23 passes in the move which led to the headed equaliser from Sitko Belarus just playing out time we're playing out time here 4 minutes of added time but we've already played 2 minutes of the added time another very efficient night for Fabio Capello only he knows in the team at the moment exactly the extent of the halftime discussion in the dressing room but certainly putting Gerard in to disrupt Kulchi it's a major factor in this second half Belarus over on the left bridge is just he's not out of position that was well played by bridge good swift back pass to goalkeeper James and it's back towards the half way line once more a touch from crotch lampards available right Phillips has now come across to the right Beckham has stayed over on the left hand side it's right Phillips now taking on 3 or 4 Belarus players and then goes down very easily looking for a free kick and it's not given I can see that Greeny smirking here is he suggesting Beckham can't make it back up we were thinking that the run that he had to keep the ball in and then the corner he had to go across to the other side as well I would put money on Beckham to beat Alan Green and he kind of sprint there wouldn't you? certainly Belarus building from the back and we've got seconds to go here in Minsk which is a difficult place to come and play and win matches Holland didn't do it in the last qualifying campaign but England have the points Crouch has the ball Lampard knocks it forward and Gerard's just straight offside referee looks at his watch for the first time the Norwegian official hasn't really been troubled in this game hasn't had to get involved in any kind of controversy at all David James got a yellow card for belting the ball away after Belarus got their equaliser the ball is to the far side of the field again the referee looks at his watch we've got I think 10 seconds of added time to play England having beaten Andorra as you'd expect having wonderfully won in Croatia then destroying Kazakhstan in the second half on Saturday and this is another terrific result for Fabio Capello here in Minsk two goals from Wayne Rooney the key to it all in the second half after quite an awkward first half when it was won all at halftime in the end England showing their qualities have won this game by three goals to one",
