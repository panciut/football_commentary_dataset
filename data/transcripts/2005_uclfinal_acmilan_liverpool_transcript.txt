 So, you've entered St Chelsea, you've both fallen to Rafa Benitez's men. Can they take that final step into immortality and beat the giants of AC Milan? Kickoff in just over 10 minutes time. Let's get a team news reminder now from Alan Green. We could take one of those goals again tonight, couldn't we? Right, two surprises sprung by Benitez. First of all, it's Barosz Natsise as the lone striker, and Kuhl plays, not Hamann or Bishkatt. The team, the goalkeeper is Dudeck. The defenders are Finn and Carriker, Pupia and Treore. Then Gerard and Alonso. Then Garcia, Kuhl and Risa, and finally Barosz. AC Milan are as we expected, largely as expected. Dede is the goalkeeper. Defenders Khafu Nesta, Stam and Maldini. Kattuso, Pirlo, Seidor, Kaka, and the two strikers, Crespo and Chevchenko. So Berlusconi has got his way. Berlusconi likes two strikers in his AC Milan side, and as Alan says too, he's got tonight. Grant Taylor, might we have a different sort of game to the one perhaps we were predicting last night, because the Liverpool team's not quite the team we thought it might be? Well, I'm still not so certain about that. I still don't think that we'll see either side going gung-ho. What I do think, it's going to be very interesting, and I shall look, I know John will, with great interest, exactly the formation of this Liverpool side when they do. I mean, you were hearing straight away, and we've spoken about this Barosz-Kuhl 4-4-2. It's not going to be 4-4-2. I'll tell you what, if they play an open 4-4-2, they're dead. And so it's going to be very, very interesting just to see the formation. That's the surprise. He's got something, I have great respect for Benitez, and I think he's planned and he's seen. So I'm going to be very interested to watch those opening minutes, but I don't think they'll go gung-ho. We're going to talk to John Toshnik about the referee in a couple of moments, because John knows all about him. It seems like every way you look here at the Ataturk Stadium, there's a former Liverpool European cap winner, here's Jonathan Lechard. Mark, three weeks ago, just before the kick-off of the second leg against Chelsea, I spoke to David Faircliffe, who said, you watch Liverpool win and you listen to this atmosphere at Anfield. Now here we are, David Faircliffe, we're in Istanbul. What do you make of it? Fantastic. The support is enormous. Liverpool fans come out in force for finals. They love European finals, and I think the atmosphere will be similar to Anfield. I think they're really going to make themselves heard tonight, and they will inspire the team. And are they going to win? I think so. No reason to think that they can't beat AC Milan. A great team, obviously, experienced, matured, but Liverpool can do it. Liverpool have a lot of offensive players. They don't go along with the fact that people say Liverpool are a defensive team. They have great players going forward. If they get out the blocks quick enough, then I'm sure they will ruffle the feathers of AC Milan. One other thought. Down below us, there are 11 Liverpool players waiting to go out there. What's it like in that dressing room? You've been there, you know what it's like. They can't wait to get started, I'm sure. I watched the training session yesterday, and they were full of beans, and they were bouncing, and they can't wait to get out here and really get the action going. I think when they come out, they'll get such a welcome, I think they'll be inspired and lifted. And they're going to win 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 4-0. It would be great to say 2-0, but I think it might take the odd goal. David, thanks a lot. Thanks, Jonathan. David Faircloth with Jonathan Ledgehall. The good news is from the Liverpool fans' point of view, it seems as if peering into the darkness away to our left, that I think most of them have probably made their way into the stadium. Now we're going through a rather ornate pre-match entertainment. Jon Toschak, Manuel Enrique Mejoto-González, the referee. You said he's from Cider country. That's right, Mejoto's from up in Asturias there, Oviedo, Quijón country, referee of the Wales-Russia match at the Millennium Stadium. The European playoff game. Yeah, Anoptro, the Russian captain, spent five years in Asturias, Oviedo. Spend a whole game talking to each other. He'd recently refereed us in Vienna as well, when we were beaten one-nil by Austria. Decent referee? It was better seven years ago than he is now, I think. Good referee when he started up, then he got into the system, the federation, goodness knows what, UEFA, you've got to do this, that and the other, and I think he lost a bit. The fourth referee is the star as well. He's the one who sent the three Greeks off against Soumés, his new castle in Athens, I think it was, Olympiates. Doudin Ibanez. Oh, yes, yeah, he's the fourth referee, absolutely. That's right, yeah, so... That's the last time we mentioned the referee. The referee had a great game in the Cup final. Mark Lawrincen, David Fairclough said they'll be thinking of it. Is any other match, get on with it? That's what you intimated to us last night, your approach towards the final in Rome. Can it really be that way with seven minutes to kick off? I think it has to be, Mark. It's the only way, whatever you say, because your heart's racing, you know, you've got unbelievable nerves, and what you really want to hear from the manager, and as long as you've got your tactics, you know exactly what you're doing, you want him to be a calm and influence. You don't need Revvina, because as soon as you walk out, either players can, like, Milan or Liverpool, and see this absolutely unbelievable atmosphere, so you can feel the atmosphere and see the crowd, you're ready for it. Is there a part of you, was there a part of you in your final? Now, please say yes, because I love to think this is true. But you know, you walk out, you think, this is what I work really hard to do, and this is... No. This is the absolute way. Come on, Mark Lawrincen. Could you ask me to say yes, I'm saying it. Of course it is. Courses, and like Tosh, you're very first European Cup final. I think, you know, when you were a kid, and players from Aria were on your kid, you wanted to score the winning goal in the FA Cup final, and then, eventually, when you went to a club that was in the European Cup, you wanted to play in the European Cup final, and of course, ostensibly, you wanted to go and win it, so the answer is yes, I've just been a bit devil-man. Tom? Yeah, that's right. I mean, Shanks and Bobby used to say to us, you know, go out and enjoy the games, and don't wake up in the morning and wish you did a miss or did not. Go and do it now, you know. Don't leave anything out there, that sort of thing. You've got to be out there for 90 minutes, so you might as well enjoy it. Can you enjoy it? I mean, you can't really enjoy it, can you? Of course you can. Of course you can. You dream about things like this, and... Doesn't the enjoyment come afterwards, though, the satisfaction of the job well done? Well, if you do it well... You've got to concentrate too hard, too much to think about. You know, you've got to be ready, and you've got to go out and do it. You can't be wondering what's going to happen, waiting for things to happen, go out and make them happen. Mark, can you hear anything out there? Can you hear... We knew you were playing with Hanson. Can you hear Hanson talking to you? We never spoke to each other. No, thank goodness. Can you hear it from the side? Actually, we didn't speak to each other very much, which is quite unusual. You seem to be able to know what each other was thinking and doing, etc. You only really hear things when the ball goes out of play and there's a little bit of a love in proceedings. Otherwise, you know, in games of this magnitude, you are just solely 100% thinking about the way you're playing, about what you have to do. And then, you know, with really, really good players, they're good enough to do that and help other people as well. And obviously, you can only really help people who are alongside you, but I have to say, me and Hanson very, very rarely communicate on the pitch. Can you hear anything from the manager? Or might as well he be shouting into the wind? Listen, I'll tell you something, Pugas. If you've just played a ball to the fullback and he's got booked because it was a hospital pass, you turn the opposite way from the dugout, I'm telling you. You shouldn't... He suddenly... What? Yeah, right, that'll be right. So, Graeme Taylor, what they're saying is, you know, it's just a way of you letting off air for 90 minutes, isn't it? Well, as a manager on the... on the touchline, you do... you're involved mentally, physically with some, you know, in terms of getting up. I'm looking at the technical area here. It's the biggest technical area, I think, that I've seen. And, you know, if you're not going to stay on the edge here, you've got to be a fit manager to be in there. It must be 15 to 20 yards. But it's so far off the size of a squash court, almost, isn't it? That's right. So, we're going to... I can see Benitez, really, standing at the edge. It's going to be very interesting whether the fourth official decides to be telling them to go back because it's not a very good view for me that being that far away from the... from the pitch. But going back to what you said earlier, you are involved, but you're kidding yourself if you think the players can take on board what you're shouting at them. And so, it's just an involvement. But they see an action by you, and they tend to know, you know, whether you're happy or not. There's a running track round this ground. The AC Milan fans are way to our right, waving flags, which makes it look like an enormous white, black and red flag that they're holding up a way to our right. And the carpet, you probably know, to be watching on the telly, the previous rounds, has always said the road to Istanbul. Well, of course, this one just says Istanbul, the final. And I should think the walk from the edge of the tunnel to the edge of the pitch is probably about 25 yards or so. All the photographers are there, masked either side at the head of that red carpet, waiting for the teams who are actually in the tunnel now. We've got round about four or five minutes or so to kick off. We have the Champions League anthem as well, of course. And Mark, what are your thoughts? You've been with Liverpool all the time. Nothing that's going to change your mind at this late stage? No, I was looking at more tissue walking up there from our screen, all dressed in red. Maybe that's a no-man we hope tonight. No, I'm going to go for Liverpool. I am slightly surprised about the team selection, but maybe Rafael Benitez knows something that I certainly don't. But he has got some flexibility within the side that he's chosen there. As John was saying, he could change formation if he needed to. Well, and he's done so throughout the season on a couple of occasions, even playing with three at the back. I don't see that being the case tonight, because Pellegrino would normally be involved, but I certainly believe he's got the flexibility. Let's hope he doesn't have to change it, unless it's in a positive way, Mark. An enormous Liverpool flag from the goal away to our left, AC Milan flag from the goal away to our right. And now in the centre of each half, held by around about 15 or so gentlemen all dressed in white. And the cameras are turned now on the tunnel. The flashbulbs go off, which is a sign that the players are in the tunnel, and we're just a few minutes away from the start of this Champions League. Final European Cup final, whatever it is, 2005, and we can see the players now. Milan in white tonight, and Liverpool in red. Here are the teams, and here are the cheers that greet them. And it's interesting, John Toschak, their walking pass, the European Cup, which reminds me of that Sir Alex Ferguson quote from the 1999 final. Don't be walking pass at the end of the match, and not able to pick it up. That's right, yeah. Fantastic scenes, and I know Mark, we're here about the football, but we would have to say, I mean, I've thoroughly enjoyed this before the game, that the Turkish people have put on a fantastic show here. Looking down at the pitch now as well, I love the goals, you know, like the old sub-utile goals, the black net in Hungary, and Wembley used to have it, 1950. Graham remember those days, I don't remember them so well. The 1953 black net. That's right, the 63 or whatever, it really is a fantastic, fantastic setting. The flashbulbs go off, the smoke a few flares from away to our left, we can hear the Champions League anthem, so the voices you'll hear tonight, the former England manager Graham Taylor, John Toschak, Mark Lawrenceon, of course, Alan Green, and first of all this evening, on what could be a momentous night for Liverpool. Will this be their fifth European Cup triumph? Yes, our two football corresponded as the smoke wafts across the Ataturk stadium, my kingdom. Well, I'm sorry to start with a negative mark, but those flares shouldn't be in the stadium. Anyway, let's get that out of the way, we should not be having flares on the stadium after the incidents we've had this season in the Champions League. However, good evening from me, and when you write down the two 11s on paper, it probably looks to be no contest. But then that's what you might have thought when Liverpool took on the Italian champions, Juventus, in the quarter-final. Organisation hung the will to win, mentality got them through, plus a course of little help from the Cop. And tonight they've travelled in their thousands, one of European football's longest journeys, hoping to recreate the spirit of 77 and 78, 81 and 84 to launch a new era in the legend that is Liverpool Football Club, the revolution, one of the flags here has been telling us. Standing in their way, a name synonymous with sophistication and style, Milan, personified by their great captain, the elegant Maldini. Their lineup tonight, posing for the cameras down there, all in white, Dida, Kapu, Stam, Nesta, Maldini, Perlo, Gattuso, Seidorf, Kata, Shevchenko and Crespo, as Maldini shakes hands with Stephen Gerard, the Spanish officials down there, officiating the Liverpool lineup. Surprising, of course. No seesay in the starting lineup with Kul and Baros, both beginning for Liverpool tonight. Their team, Dudeck, Finan, Cariga, Hoopier, Traorri, Alonso, Luis Garcia, Gerard, Risa, Kul and Baros. And interestingly, in the build-up, there was quite a lot of speculation that in Zaghi might be starting tonight for AC Mound, he's not even on the bench, neither is the injured Ambrosini, the man who got the goal, of course, which brought Milan through to the final against PSV Eindhoven. Liverpool's sub-Sahkarsen, Cece, Smitsa, Haman, Yossami, Nunes and Biscar. In the build-up to the game yesterday, Clarence Seidorf, who's won this competition with three different clubs, said, well, it'll start at 9.45, it'll be tough, and Milan will win. I'm not sure it is going to start at 9.45, we're after 9.45 local time, but we're about to get underway here. Liverpool against AC Milan, the final of the 2005 Champions League in Istanbul, the 50th final of the European Cup, 28 years to the very day that Liverpool first won the trophy back in 1977. In this first half, Liverpool, all in red, will play towards their fans, away to our left. Seize the moment, Liverpool, for one or two of the players down there, this may not come again. Sammy Huppier, deeply aware of it, as Liverpool begin, and will look to start well here. Traiori, near side the field, and that was a very shaky ball from him, straight to the Milan side, Liverpool must keep possession better than that. The ball is inside the Liverpool half, and now, for the first time, we see Seidel, 15 yards inside the Liverpool half. Finds the young Brazilian Kaka, cross-cumns Traiori, and the referee gives a free kick early on here to Milan, Mark Lawrence. Well, Traiori's first two touches aren't particularly good, he gave the ball away, and then he just upended Kaka as well, so I hope he gets better. Free kick to Milan, and Perlo, Andrea Perlo, who takes the free kicks, of course, lining this one up down this near side. This is the Milan right, first test for Jersey Dude, in goes the free kick, and the shot comes in, and it's there! Milan have scored! A Maldini! The captain is being absolutely submerged by his teammates, the goal has been timed. Well, a minute made the only at the game, just over. Well, what a start. Well, we spoke about Traiori, didn't we, that the ball came back from Moupple's kickoff to him, he gave it away, Liverpool then never retrieved the ball, he ended up giving the foul away on the edge of the penalty area, a decent ball in, but very, very slap-marked by Liverpool, it's a great start from Rolambar, it's a poor goal to concede. That must be one of the quickest goals in the final of the Champions League, and, well, the only thing that you can possibly say now from the occasion point of view, I mean, it's a wretched, wretched start for Liverpool, but the only thing you can say at least is the early goal might just make this an open contest. And Kao-El Maldini, the veteran, we've talked long and hard about him in this game, trying to win this trophy here tonight for a fifth time, his seventh final, you could have got very long odds, I'm sure, against him scoring the first goal here this evening, but already Liverpool are a goal down here in Istanbul. Now we know Ancelotti's on about any press conference saying we can score very, very early, and maybe he knew something that we certainly didn't. Well, welcome to the Five Live commentary, welcome to our World Service listeners, you join us here in Istanbul for the most spectacular of starts from AC Milan. There's been so much optimism around this city on behalf of Liverpool and the build-up to this game, but of course, this is an AC Milan 11 with seven of the team who won this tournament in Manchester only two years ago. All the talk about Crespo, Ciebchenko and Kaka, and it's Paolo Maldini who comes up from the back to Stonjers, you do, Deck, following the free kick from Andrea Perlo. And now Liverpool with tri-Auri, and tri-Auri goes down, doesn't win the free kick, and Kaka, who was very involved of course early on here, winning the free kick, and Liverpool need to get hold of this early on here now, having conceded so early in the game. They do, and I think Maldini's goal was only second ever in the Champions League, but what an unlikely scorer. Well, Liverpool now trying to regroup a goal down, and it's Milan Baros on the ball. Across comes Jep Stammer, Liverpool have got a corner. Well, that's better, a corner kick there first over on the far side, but right, only three and a half minutes gone in Istanbul, and the Liverpool fans still won the two of them, maybe making their way into the stadium, will be stunned by the big scoreball, 1-0 to AC Milan. Liverpool have a corner kick there first, and they need to compose themselves here. All the tactics set out by Rafael Benitez, they whip the corner right back, and the shot is driven in by Risa. Cleared by Milan, back to the halfway line. It hit Stammer, it hit Stammer, it was a great strike, I think it was on target. Ball played again by Liverpool, great header from Loppea. And Dito makes the save by the left hand post. Well, that's the reply you would want if you're Rafael Benitez. Obviously, disastrous and sloppy start, but at least certainly the shot that came in from Risa was goalbound, decent header by Loppea, made Dito make the save. Ball is going to trickle out a player on the far side of the field, and it's going to be a Milan thrown. Well, four and a half minutes gone. I think so many people discussing the prospects here talked about a possible stalemate. Two sides playing very deep, but AC Milan winning the free kick early on, delivered by Perlo, and turned in by Paolo Maldini of all people, the great captain. Milan now just down this near side of the field, the two-sows lost possession though, and Risa's got the free kick even though he had the ball. Spanish referee gives him the free kick, and he buys his time before Liverpool take it. We haven't even had really time to see how Liverpool are set up, but it is probably as we thought, which Barros up front, Kuhl just off in Garcia down the right in front, or alongside in Gerard, and then on the left, Risa and Alonso in front of the back four. And BBC World Service, and five line from Istanbul, the Champions League final, and AC Milan are in front already, this pedigree team, of course. Ball is with John Arna Risa, near side. Risa manages to get away from Gattuso. Here comes Risa, neat support, there are two or three Milan players around him, Kappu made the challenge, and the referee signals only a throw in, even though Liverpool wanted more than that. Well, they were very, very quickly into him as well, and what Gattuso did, he made Risa take him on and force a challenge then from Kappu. Seydorff gets the better of Luis Garcia, Seydorff who was outstanding in the matches against Manchester United, and now Maldini supporting this latest attack. Ball played into the area, I don't think we've even mentioned Shevchenko yet. Not even sure he's had a touch of the ball, but his team lead by one goal to nil, as Risa now tries to escape down this near side, Gattuso makes a good recovery, and Kappu picks up the loose ball, and Milan having scored the goal, have settled pretty well, imposing themselves here early on, long ball forward by Perlo. Shevchenko's beaten the offside truck, Kross comes up here, good thing too, because Kraspo was steaming into the six-yard area. Well, I thought he was offside, we'll deal with that later, but for once, Shevchenko's first touch wasn't great, he was on, he was definitely on from the monitor, as the ball was played, Shevchenko better first touch could have been too. Well, Maldini having scored the goal from the free kick, encouraged by that, is going into the area once more with Japp's snap. Corner kick, headed away, not very well, you know you're cleared off here, almost scraped that one past Jersey Dudek, Dudek makes the save, fortunately from his point of view, there's no real power in that slice clearance by Sammy Huppier, and Liverpool still rattled as Dudek clears, and Barasch now tries to win the ball down this near side, but carries it out of play, and it's going to be a throw into AC Milan. Let's get an early word from one of our two other guests here, Graham Taylor. Well, I think the interesting thing is the amount of space that Maldini's getting on that left-hand side, it's not the fact that he scored, that was from a free kick, and Garcia at times, he's been drawn in onto Seedorf, but then Maldini is just completely free for Milan to play him on, and for him to continue with the attack, that's really surprised me, because we were talking earlier about what they would do when out of possession of the ball, and it's just a free pass out to Maldini all the time, he's an outlet for them whenever Milan want him. All the preparation that would have been going on into this game, all the tactics to being devised by Raphael Benitez, and yet Milan score one of the quickest goals in the European Cup Final history. But now Liverpool, because Barasch has been fouled, Liverpool have a free kick, and Stephen Gerrard, 25 yards out, is there with Alonso alongside him. Milan have got everybody back. Gerrard takes his time, referee's ready. Dida crouches away to our left, it's touched on to Gerrard, Gerrard lifts the ball in, it's a little too high though for Harry Kuhl, and nothing comes from that, and they see Milan have a goal kick. Yeah, just a little bit of a waste when you consider from the previous corner they've had two attempts at goal, and I'm not quite sure, Mike, it's not really a question to you, but I wouldn't think there's many times this season that Liverpool have come back from a goal down in the Champions League, certainly, and actually gone on to win. Well, we mentioned last night, Mark, in the build-up with John Toschak. I mentioned that Liverpool altogether this season had lost 18 games in all football, and in any two of those games had they managed to score a goal. One of the games was the Carling Cup Final against Chelsea when they lost 3-2, and the other one, well, the goal they got was an own goal in a defeat at Manchester United. Apart from that, they've all been zeros, and now, of course, they have to score goals against one of the most organised defences in world football. Milan leading here by one goal to a nil, Maldini still, as Graham Taylor was saying, has so much time and freedom over on that left-hand side, and here he goes again, rolling back the years, Sadorff now, on to Gattuso, Gattuso, sidestep Steven Gerard. Now, Perlo comes into the movement, Milan with the goal advantage, have settled down far quicker than Liverpool. Perlo again calling the shots, can't get the ball in over Jamie Carragher though, Liverpool being pressed back inside their own half. Milan winning the tackles once more in midfield, and now Barra, she's trying to break, but across comes Japsdam, Barra's a little isolated there, big gap between him and the midfield. Milan take possession once more with Nesta, and Nesta sprints through the centre circle. Kaka on to, well, he hasn't given it to Maldini yet, but he's certainly available. It's still Kaka, drops it back into Sadorff, Cepchenco's waiting, it's all Milan at the moment, leading 1-0, shot driven in by Kattuso off Jamie Carragher. Liverpool now looking to try and counterattack, Harry Kuhl was pulled back, and they've got a free kick on the edge of the centre circle. I'll tell you what, they're lucky as well, and it's Perlo, I think he's lucky to get away without a yellow, because definitely Liverpool were away. Every time Milan get the ball at the moment, there is an option, there's everybody available to them, they look at the moment against Liverpool, as though they've got an extra man. Rafa Benitez just came out to speak there to John Arnaurisa, and Risa's ball in towards Baros doesn't find him, and he'll need better delivery than that, better service than that, well, Baros, if he's to test this AC Milan defence, it's back again with the Brazilian Dida, and so much experience in this AC Milan backfoul, they've got between them nearly 400 caps, and Dida now still hasn't cleared yet. Left-footed ball into the Liverpool half, it should be headed back by Steve Finner. But again, can't find anybody in red, and it's Kakao once more, he's got options left and right, doesn't quite deliver right for Shedchenko, Shedchenko's got it now, over on the far side, he turns and faces Steve Finner. Finner gets a foot in, but it comes back once more to Shedchenko, driven back and wants more Maldini on the ball, changes the direction, across the field it comes, but Kafa won't reach that, and it's a throw to Liverpool. Yeah, for once if they've given the ball away, just trying to look really when Milan have got the ball, and the positions are both along to Gerard. Good throw there by Liverpool, now Baros needs support inside the penalty area, still Milan Baros, Baros tries to slide the ball into the area, back again to Baros, but AC Milan coming back to help out each other at the back, clear. It's reset down this near side of the field, jumps over the first challenge from Gattuso, but Kaka hard working coming back to help out in that area. It's Milan now with Perlo, drifts it to the far side of the field, acres of space for Maldini over on that far side. This is the Milan left, AC Milan won, Liverpool 0, early goal from Maldini following the free kick from Perlo. Baros chasing back there, tucked into the right hand side position for Garcia, who was obviously caught up field. All the planning though, to try and impose themselves here on Milan early on, to disrupt the midfield rhythm, to try and prevent Perlo from building from the back in the way that the great Albertini used to from Milan, but it's once more Perlo with a lovely ball to Clarence Seydor, lovely first touch from the Dutchman. Liverpool unable to get the ball off him, the ball is lifted in, Traori has to volley it away. And now Liverpool, all they're doing really is just knocking it long back inside the Milan half, and it's going to be a Milan throw near side of the field. Both Seydor from Gattuso just getting in little areas in between Liverpool's midfield players at the moment, and they are always available, hence it looks as though they've got extra players. Well, I hope that in the build-up we paid as much respect as we should have done to AC Milan. They may have gone off the ball a little towards the end of the season domestically, but they were always, of course, the favourites going into this match. I think the feeling was though that there was going to be so much hunger from Liverpool out there tonight. The mentality would be so strong with all those great results behind them in this run, that that would see them through with the wonderful support as well. But Liverpool at the moment are just chasing shadows down there, and it's Gattuso now, looping the ball forward, looking for Shevchenko. And Liverpool either didn't cut it out, it didn't in the end run for Shevchenko. Flag has gone up anywhere on this near side of the field, and Liverpool have already taken the free kick. I think it went up for Humboldt. I think that's where it was. I thought Shevchenko got the wrong side of Jamie Carragher. In the meantime, Luis Garcia easily lost possession for Liverpool, and it's coming back once more at the back four. Crespo trying to win the corner kick off. Sammy Huppier, and he's got it as well. The corner kick to Milan near side, and they're leading 1-0, and we played 13 minutes of the first half. Well, from the first free kick came the goal, from the second set piece to the corner, there was all sorts of problems. Huppier headed it against his own defender, then sliced it high, so Dudette could save it. So they need to deal with this in a more professional manner here. Sadolff with the corner kick to the near post, headed off by Liverpool. Yeah, Stam tries to power it forward. Stam again has a big kick, and it drops to Maldini. Liverpool all over the place at the moment, but as Maldini goes crashing inside the penalty area, no foul, though. And that's two or three efforts now that Liverpool have scrambled away. It was Garcia who got the ball off the line so close there, Milan to taking a 2-0 lead. Flick header, I think, was it by Crespo at the near post? It was by Crespo, and I think actually he chested it, or came off the shoulder, Garcia, but he did exactly what he's intended to do, as a marker on the post, just get rid of the ball, but stay there more importantly. Milan won Liverpool 0. Now here's an opportunity for Baras to chase, maybe, but Capu just swivels away from him and then strikes it back inside the Liverpool half. Traore, short of the half-way line. And there's nothing at all there and shows the lack of composure really in the anxiety that's clearly in the Liverpool camp at the moment, with nearly 15 minutes to go. They need something to happen for them soon here, because Milan have taken early control and they are threatening to score a second goal here. No wonder Ralph Albenitez is pouncing around in that technical area down there. Hardly seen anything of Gerrard and Javi Alonso yet. Now Luis Garcia, spinning well for his team, finds Reza down this near side. Here's a chance for Liverpool now to get the ball into the Milan area. Looking for Harry Kuhl across comes a defender who was Alessandro Nesta, and it's a throw to Liverpool, getting great vocal support now from their fans, who are all over the stadium, but predominantly away to our left. Reza to take the throw in, and yeah, Hopia now is going to make a late run into the penalty area. The ball is thrown back to Alonso, and now Reza wants more. Reza, taking on Gattuso, maybe shows too much of the ball to the Italian international, can't get past him, and it's a goal kick to be taken by Dider. I would like now with 15 and a half minutes to go, gone to hear from John Toschak. John, what are your views at the moment? Well, I'm a little bit disappointed the way that Liverpool has set up, to be honest with you. Even before the goal, in the first attack, Maldini had oceans of room. Garcia has been asked to tuck in, probably because Liverpool are one midfielder short in that area, and Maldini's had oceans of room to go forward, but it's a super goal, a well-worked goal. If you look at Perla's body movement, he's dropped the shoulder, played it, the inside of the foot, picking out Maldini, he's had a great volley, and I mean it's a super goal. But Liverpool, unless one of Liverpool's fullbacks start pushing on, then they're not going to see too much more of the ball, because they're keeping four players back there with two. Thank you, John. John Toschak, Graham Taylor, Mark Lawrence, with us on five-live, and BBC World Service. 16 and a half minutes gone, and the first half in Istanbul could hardly have been a worse start really by Liverpool, conceding that early goal from Palomal Dini and now up here for Liverpool, into Gerard inside the centre-circle. He's dragged it back to Carragher, and now this is better from Liverpool. They find Finan over on the far side, this is the Liverpool right. Better ball now from Liverpool to find Alonso on the edge of the centre-circle. A little bit more flow and rhythm now from Liverpool. As the ball is lifted in by Reeser, Kules missed it, and Garcia has missed it as well. And Perlo pops up over on the far side, the field. The word was from Italy that he'd had a poor end of the season, Perlo, but he's certainly back on song here and now some lovely skills from Cacca to get away in midfield. Striding forward, Cacca, moving on to this ball, fellow Brazilian Caffu. Triorri needs to hold him up in it goes, little header in from Cacca, has gone wide, and that's a goal kick to Duda. A good move from Milan, though, Cacca inevitably involved on the right-hand side, and it's a difficult ball for Cacca to deal with, he just sort of flicked it on with his head. But at least from Liverpool's move before, both the fullbacks, John Tossett was saying both the fullbacks involved, which is something positive. Well, I suppose really, with only 20 minutes gone, it could have been even worse for Liverpool here. Milan have been so strong early on and created danger on two or three occasions. One nil, though, AC Milan lead, and Liverpool trying to go forward once more, but Garcia can't find Barosh, tied it up by Milan and the app-stam immediately, and there's the space again for Maldini over on the left-hand side. He plays a square ball to Seydor, lovely first touches from the midfield players from Milan, and now it's Stam, two Dutchmen linking. Always been a great Dutch presence, of course, in the Milan side. Long ball from Seydor, and Cienco stretches, just can't quite reach it, and it's a goal kick to Liverpool. Well, just looking at Treyore, he was sucked in for a second, and as soon as Seydor saw the space, the run came from Cienco, and he's not even aware or watching where the ball's going, Jimmy Treyore. And I'm getting a message that Harry Kuhl might have picked up a knock. And one or two Liverpool subs, he says he's warming up down there. Harry Kuhl has hardly been in the game, and he has hobbled out of that challenge. He's won a free kick, but he may need attention. 18.5 minutes gone. He's not moving well at all, is he? He might have to come off and receive attention, so Liverpool could be reduced to 10 men at the moment. They've got a free kick, Alonso's going to take it. Gerard and Barosh, Luis Garcia in forward positions, as Kuhl just hobbles off to have a word with Benitez. Alonso just takes a short free kick. Liverpool fans at the moment very quiet, as Alonso strikes it very long, and Dita's there to make the save, jumping and catching all in one movement. Dita with arms and extension against Luis Garcia. It can only be one winner, if you think. Now, once more, it's Perlo on the ball, and everything as usual starting with Perlo and moved on through midfield from Seydorff, and Maldini races onto the ball down the left-hand side. Isn't it strange? Talked a lot about Kaffu's threat down the right, but most of the threats so far is coming over on the other side of the field, with Paolo Maldini, who the last time the Milan were in the final, actually played it at centre-back, Colatse, the Georgian, left-back, he's one of the players on the bench this evening. Throw into Liverpool, nearly 20 minutes gone in the first half in the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. Barosh has a free kick, and Milan just kicked the ball out over on the far side of the field. So free kick to Liverpool, Kuhl, has he come back on again? Yes, he has. The manager, not only the physio, but the manager also had a word with him. Free kick has taken, and Alonso plays it to the sneer side. Now, Traorey needs some decent distribution here. Finds Risa, infield it goes to Gerard. Can Gerard inspire Liverpool back into this game? Risa's got it, Barosh is waiting, so to his Garcia, and it goes, and again it's too high for Barosh. Can't climb to get that one, and it runs away to the far side of the field for Milan throwing. That's a problem for them though, Mike. The delivery's OK, but... I don't know, you never ever fancy Barosh in the penalty head against the six-foot plusses of the Stams, and your Nestes and your Maldinis, if this were... The ball has got to be so precise. You think he's coming off, by the way. Harry Kuhl, the big gamble, the big brave decision by Rafael Benitez, and it looks as if it's only going to last for 20 minutes here. So there's more disruption. All again, all the thinking and all of the tactics are going to have to go up in the air to a certain extent now, because Harry Kuhl's going to have to come off. Well, I think what will happen, and it might be a blessing in disguise, they might actually get someone to come and play on the right-hand side to be like a smitzer or a Nunes, and just solve the problem of Maldini getting down the left, which would be the first thought. Now, the ball is with Garcia inside the centre-circle, and that's a decent one to Risa. Risa's trying to find Kuhl, and Kuhl's now a passenger, and needs to be replaced. Not sure how he was injured, but he's coming out of this final, and now Sammy Huppier wins the throw-in down this near-side of the field. Throw-in to Liverpool, 21.5 minutes gone. If you're just joining us in five-live in BBC World Service, the worst possible start for Liverpool conceding here so early on, Maldini getting on the end of a free-kick from Perlo. Smitzer coming on. One of the number of players it has to be said in this Liverpool squad tonight, who may not be at Anfield next season. Throw-in taken by Troyori onto Barras, who could be another one, and Barras can't control that one, and Perlo loops it to the far side of the field, and again, this is getting almost monotonous, Maldini, with all the space over on the left-hand side. With Vladimir Smitzer, who had his birthday yesterday, he's about to come into this European Cup final, as Milan waste the ball, rare moment from them and Dudek chases, and now they can make the change if they want to, and will make the change as well, I think, with Harry Kuhl about to be replaced by Vladimir Smitzer. We'll hear from Alan Green till halftime. Well, I timed the goal at 52 seconds. The previous fastest goal in the European Cup final, it may still be, is Enrique Mateos for Real Madrid in 1959. Now, that was only timed at one minute, so obviously, we're precisely figured in the one minute to determine whether or not Maldini's goal makes history. The other thing to tell you, and I worry about this one, is that 1-0 is the most common score in the European Cup final. But on one occasion in the Champions League, and Marc and Mike and I were together, a team came from 1-0 down to win by two goals to one. Remember it? Barcelona, 1999. So, Schwieitzer is on, and he's definitely going back to France. Kuhl might be headed out of Anfield as well. Here's Hopiah, Liverpool have to get some sort of significant response here. Garcia, Flixel, and Pruitt-Barrow, had Stammer struggling there and then used his muscle to head the ball back to the... By the way, the other thing, I saw clearly how Kuhl got injured. Nesta kicked him. Nesta caught him. Right, so, tactically, Schmeitz has gone to play down the right-hand side of midfield, hopefully to solve the Maldini problem. That leaves Garcia basically playing off Baros. Lisa, heads the ball forward. Nesta is there, Baros trying to hustle him, and the flag is up for offside anyway. So, it's been a dreadful first quarter of the game for Liverpool. And it's been a long, long time since they've had a little AC Milan one. But at least Liverpool have sort of settled themselves down a little bit, Alan. Not greatly, but, you know, the first thing, especially in the final as well, is not to concede a second one. Here's Caffu, a immense experience, of course, from Caffu. 35, next month. And this is the only competition he has got a winners' medal for, a significant competition. He's never won a Champions League Caffu. The ball is back with Stam. Tynesta back to Stam. Stam's still inside his own half. There's no reason why Milan should be unnecessarily aggressive, having taken the lead. Caffu once more, up towards the half way line, into Pirlo. Pirlo swings it forward, neat touch there by Kaka. Kaka takes the return from Seydor, and it goes towards Caffu, it's Chef Genko, rather, who always wants to attack, of course, but the balls behind Chef Genko, and decided to play for a throw into Liverpool. Well, that was the key behind Chef Genko. He made his run, he just needed it. He didn't need it to his feet, he just needed it in front of him, and he was, again, the wrong side of Jimmy Torore, wrong side defensively for Liverpool. Speaking of players who probably will not last at Anfield, through the summer, he's certainly one of them. 25 minutes played here in Istanbul. Remember, it's a quarter past 10 at night here in Turkey. Liverpool, 12-1-0. Schmitzah, into Alonso, good ball by Alonso, through the centre-circle, Teresa, who'd peeled inside, driven past by Teresa, but that's easy for Stam, just to head back to Dida. The thing about the pass, Alan, the pass isn't good. What can he do? It's coming to Barros on his forehead, if we're assuming he gets it. There's nobody up there with him. You've got to be a heck of a player to sort of stun that and take it down and bring somebody else into the game. There might be a half chance for Cece to challenge Stam in the air, but not Barros at the moment. Now, it's played down the Milan left, and here's Maldini again. Maldini in, but can't find Kaka. Liverpool clear. Stam knocks it back up, Field Flag is up for offside against Crespo. He was offside as well. Just worried a little bit about Barros in Sofara. He's running the line in terms of the defenders. He's working so, so hard when he's not got the ball. You're wanting to work hard when Liverpool have got the ball and get in little areas where Liverpool can hit him. But at the moment, it's harder works coming chasing Milan. And the trouble in that situation is that he'll be absolutely cream-crackered by about 60 minutes. There you go. Pupya has the ball forward. The challenge was aggressive, but fair, according to the referee, Gonzalez. And then it's won back by Liverpool. No, Garcia has it. Barros is through the middle. Again, it's high. Nesta just flicks it away with his forehead and runs away. Well played, Nesta. Finding Seidorf. Seidorf now, up towards the halfway line. Tackle and loses it to Alonso. Then Risa, back to Thriori. Gerard Alonso, better from Liverpool, more aggressive from Liverpool. And they have to do something special here to get back into this game. Not once the season actually has an opponent in the Champions League scored more than once against Liverpool. But now they're almost certainly going to have to score twice. That was a poor pass back from Barros, but Gerard made something of it. Finnan takes it up on the far side. On it goes towards Barros. Stampp puts it on a plate for a throw-in. Love over the edge of the Milan penalty here. 27 minutes gone here on the BBC. Liverpool 0 AC Milan won the goal from Paolo Maldini. The wonderful Milan captain after just 52 seconds. Throw-in taken for Liverpool, crossed into the penalty here. Once more Stampp heads it away, he must think it's quite easy. Liverpool's crosses not finding red shirts. And now there's a foul by Schrizzer, free kick Milan. Just wondering, obviously, with John and Graham watching the game, whether John Toschak could just keep his eye on Barros for a few minutes. And I've been a former forward himself, seeing if he's actually wasting his energy running where he is or not. I'll bring in John Toschak in just a moment to see what he thinks about a situation that has not improved for Liverpool since the disastrous opening. The fields of Anfield Road at least ringing round. The Stampp Liverpool supporters trying to lift their team, and they need to. Alonso, Alonso, on towards Schrizzer. Schrizzer takes it up and then leaves it for Garcia. Garcia finds Marisa, down the stair touch line, Liverpool left. Into Garcia, Garcia with a fancy flick, but not enough to trouble Seydorf. And here's Kaka rampaging through the Liverpool midfield. Kaka is still running, he's made four yards. Ball breaks in the penalty, a flag is up for offside. Doesn't matter, Schavchenko celebrates a goal, he doesn't stand. How far was Kaka allowed to run at Liverpool's defence? That is, we've talked about this space and what happens is, it's Liverpool players chasing, he is just, just offside. It's actually an excellent decision, but A, Liverpool are so square, and B, you should never be allowed in a cup final, especially in the first half when you're not even chasing the game to be able to run that for your defence. Liverpool do not concede a second goal, that goes without saying really. 16 minutes to half time, now 1-0 down. Gerard the captain, a quiet figure so far, finds Finan, Finan's crossed into the penalty here, goes a long way by Fulverisa, good challenge, comes in and then the shot driven wide, it's a goal kick, it was Gattuso who made the challenge on Risa. Yeah, it looked like it's going to be half a chance for Risa, I think just in Milan, white sock just sort of nicked the ball away, but it was, Gattuso, it was an excellent challenge from the number eight. Actually Garcia is quite furious because Garcia took the ball in his chest and he thought it was his chance to not reset. Better. Goal kick, Ditas taking quite a while, any time he's had the ball anywhere near his feet, here he comes forward with a huge figure, 6'5", the Brazilian goalkeeper for AC Milan, the referee's given a file against Finan on Crespo. Well, you don't need to file there Alan, Crespo isn't exactly going to fight you, he wants to feel you and by feeling you and trying to put you off, he's just bought the file. Free kick to Milan, taken by Seydor, back to Stam, and Stam placing through the centre circle to Cafu, Cafu onto the right side and Schochenko tried to dummy a triori but forgot to keep hold of the ball instead of playing Liverpool. So, John Toshak, what do you feel about the way Barra is? Well, first of all, I'd be more concerned, I think what we've seen after now is a typical Liverpool performance away from home in a premiership, you know, and I would like to see Triori move inside and leave three against two and push Finan and Risa further forward down the flanks and oblige the Milan midfielders to open out and give Liverpool more room because Xavier Lonson and Gerard have been completely overrun. Liverpool have been at their best when they've had the three of them in there. Barros, we know at times wants too many touches at the ball, is a lone striker there, but Liverpool really, the players in midfield, for me, they're all over the shop and I think that, you know, if they can hang on to just one nil at half time, sort themselves out, then they're with a chance because Milan are probably a couple of goals back in Liverpool at the moment and saddens me to say it. 14 minutes to go in the first half, the Milanese flies waving in there, Triori with Chef Tenko, Chef Tenko feeds it on, it's saved by the goalkeeper, do it. And there were two players, Milan players inside the Liverpool penalty, just one defender back there, Triori. This was Cress, even Triori was in the wrong position because he said about the balls being played over him before. This time Chef Tchenko made a clever run, he was on the shoulder of Triori and ran the other side, i.e. goal side of him and caught him out of position this time. Well, they're finding so much room down the left flank, Milan, and then when they played the ball towards the Liverpool left-back position, Triori's in all sorts of over. One nil to Mala, that was a foul on Fennin, play continues because the referee gave the advantage, Schritzer running forward and then he loses it. Gerard dived in on Stam, Stam won it, it's cleared to the halfway line and also heads it back, Kofi on the volley, flicks it towards the left side and here's Risa for Liverpool, Liverpool very much second best at the moment. But remember Barcelona, two goals can be scored in stoppage time. Celtic came from behind to end, didn't he? European cup. Here's Kofi, Kofi drills it forward, Risa chases after, Kaffu is there, Kaffu clears it left-footed into the centre of the Milan half, headed down by Gerard, snap shot by Garcia but not on target, unlike the Juventus effort, it's high and behind goal kick. Well, he was always stretching, wasn't he? If you watch when he actually made contact with him as well, his body was just in that awkward position, it never really looked like he was going to score. Bent his body. Half volley and didn't catch it properly. Did it with a goal kick for AC Milan, it's just unbelievable, they took the lead within 52 seconds here in Istanbul with Maldini's goal. Ball is inside the Milan half, Kaffu just steps away from Baras, then flicks it carelessly straight to Schmitzer, on as a substitute for the injured Q, Gerard, back to Hopiah and Hopiah hits it long. Baras is being pulled back there by Nesta, ah, referee gives it the other way. The referees deem that the Baras was actually pulling Nesta's shirt. What did you think? When I looked I thought, no. No, that's what I thought too, thought it should have been a free kick to Liverpool. Maldini runs out of possession there and runs the ball out of play actually, it's going to be a throw in to Liverpool on the far side. 12 minutes left in the first half, Liverpool nail AC Milan one. Milan all in white, Liverpool all in red, both consider the strips to be their lucky strips on the final stage of this major European competition. The biggest club competition on earth. Doudek, Clip Prezic was the left side and again, he's wondering who's around him wearing all white and the ball runs out of play. As a poor baller, it was clipped over Treyori's head for once, certainly not blameless. Caafu, good pass, taken on the chest by Starr, now it's with Maldini. Maldini just retreats and flicks it back to his goalkeeper, Dita. Dita inside the penalty, a barrage, makes a half sort of effort towards the goalkeeper. Clips, headed down now by Maldini, Crespo falls over, it flicked on towards Kaka, couldn't control it and it's back with Liverpool. Filling, they haven't been real proper chances for Liverpool so far. No, just that racist shot that was blocked and was it a hoop you had at Dita saved? Treyori just waste possession, he just wafted the ball outfield and it's hit away by Nesta, headed back by Treyori, straight to another white shirt, he's having a mirror, Jimmy Treyori. Maldini in the far side of the field, 10 minutes left in the first half. Milan, very dominant in this the 50th European Cup final. Stam hits it outfield, Treyori heads it down, again it's straight to a white shirt and here's Seidoff, that Seidoff feeds it towards Crespo and accepted well by Finan. Well, it's a cut of a case and it's just in between Liverpool's right back and right side, essential defended Carragher and Finan that Milan have looked to get in. Finan with a flurry down the right flank but runs out of possession, it's cleared by Stam, only to Gerard, hasn't Gerard been quiet? Here he is now, a long ball towards us near flank, Reesah heads it into the penalty area, Barashe, then back, Garcia shoots on the volley, didn't catch it right, shot is wide. Better though, decent ball by Gerard, headed on, flicked on twice, actually second time by Barashe into loose, Garcia and again he hit across the ball really, never looked comfortable. He sent though the encouragement he gave to the Liverpool fans who responded with noise. They were quietened as early as the first minute, twice, Garcia has been in semi similar positions to the goal effort he scored against Juventus, that fantastic goal that put Liverpool two up against the team, remember that have beaten Milan to the Italian championship. Liverpool supporters really need to lift the team, they're far too quiet at the moment. Alonso tries to blast the ball through towards Barashe, Nesta got there first, Nesta finds Maldini and Maldini is strutting around the stage no matter what his age is as if he just owns it. On it goes, to the left flank and that's out of play now, often in throw-in to AC Milan. You talked about Steven Gerard trying to get in the game, you've been too busy putting fires out. Yep, yep, not involved, not properly involved. Seydor back now to Pirlo, and Pirlo lost the ball to the right side, Kaafu back to Catoosa, Catoosa in towards Seydor, Pirlo says that's my ball, on it goes towards, I think that was Crespo and it's cleared up field by Finan, but into a Milan half in which there's only one red shirt that's been on Barashe. The other problem as well for Liverpool is it's not right in terms of midfield all over the place, John Toshak rightly points out, but also when under any form of pressure, Alonso's just given the ball away. Kaka, Crespo breaks forward, he has to be offside and he is offside. It took a little while for the Lions to raise his flag, but that's rightly raised. It's that run again, it's a very, very, very dangerous game to play. He is offside, but it's very, very tight and it's one thing for certain, if they keep doing that Milan will get in. They'll get a second goal. Liverpool have to score, remember. They were 1-0, John remembered Anfield against Olympiakos, and I don't put in the same category as AC Milan, but that was a phenomenal comeback and it looks as if they're going to need another one here tonight. Good ball by Schmitzer, under Garcia, Garcia into the penalty, that was a handball journey. I think that was a handball and they've got away with it Milan, next to handle the ball. Most definitely, mostly, you could just tell by his reaction. I can't believe how the referee's assistant and then referee never saw it. Oh, and then Milan on the break here, here's Schiftenko, Schiftenko crosses, it's 2-0. And that is such an injustice to Liverpool. Crespo has scored. There should have been a penalty at the other end for a handball by Nesta, as Garcia broke through. No penalty given, Milan counterattack, upfield, ball breaks the Crespo, and this final is over. Liverpool 0, AC Milan 2, Barrages berating the referee, as he's every right to do. Handball. Yeah, I caught him on the elbow and I knew exactly what he was doing. I knew what he was doing. But the other thing, Alan, is regardless penalty or no penalty, you've got to be able, when the penalty wasn't given, you've got to be able to react, you've got to say, right, it's gone, let's sit tight, let's not conceive a chance, never mind a goal, it was far, far too easy for Milan to make it 2-0. It was indeed, but it still ranks as an injustice. Well, definitely. And what was I saying about Crespo, you only hear about him when he scores. That's five in ten in the Champions League. That is not bad, that's not a bad record. And Ancelotti's reaction indicates he knows it's over. John Toshak is about ten yards to my left. John, your thoughts? Well, as I said earlier, I think that if Liverpool could have held on 1-0 until half-time, then Raffer's very, very intelligent type, and I think that he could have maybe put this right. But I felt that Milan were a couple of goals better, and unfortunately, you know, that Liverpool have got caught out. They're four players at the back, just marking two. It's mucho tomate, as they say in Spain, for Xavier Lonso and Gerard, too much work for them. And up front, I'm afraid, that Smaise Garcia, Cuiol Barroso, Luis Garcia, haven't really been able to penetrate in the defence. Another Brazilian finds a colleague on the right flank. It was Kaka towards Kaffu. Hope he had just about got across in time, and the ball's out of play. It's going to be a throw-in to Malacca. See, that's another thing. The central defender of Liverpool's had to make some 40-50 yards over to the touchline to close the opposition's right back down. That was due to Treori as well being pulled every which way, but Luis, here is Kaffu once more, but he's offside this time, and it's a freakie. By the way, I forgot to mention, I ask you, John, did you think it was a penalty? To be perfectly honest, no, I didn't get first from here. Then on the television, I didn't really see the replay. I mean, I thought Nesta went down, pulling his arms out, trying to avoid... It was Nesta, I think, was it? Yes, it was Nesta. Trying to avoid the ball, if in his hand, but it was a great chance, you know. I mean, they got a bit of a mess, Stam and Maldini, and you would like to think that Liverpool, in a game like this, at that particular moment, could have taken advantage of that, you know, but I didn't really see Alan, to be honest with you. I'd be interested to see it halftime as any replay. It's funny, sometimes you just will something to happen, but I'd absolutely no doubt that Nesta handled the ball, and it should have been a penalty kick. Here's a penalty kick, and it's a penalty kick. Here's Kopia, on to Risa. Risa flicks it in towards Baras, it's headed away by Stam, dropping it in the first, Liverpool plus, driven, shot in by Schmitzner, but there must have been a handball, they spotted that one, didn't they? It's in exactly the same place as the Nesta handball, exactly the same place. Well, Stam actually headed the ball onto the arm of Baras, and it fell to Schmitzner, he blasted the shot, goal was but no goal. Anyway, free kick, taken by Dita. It's been a shocking first half for Liverpool, absolutely shocking. Three minutes left of the first period, and they can't wait, basically, to get in and have a word with the Finns, but they're falling short all over the pitch. Well, they've not recovered from the first minute, Alan, from the goal, and also, you know, we wondered about the tactics, and you have to say in the first half, there's only one man got the tactics right, and he's the AC Milan manager, Anciolotti. Well, right now, it's as if Milan know the game is won, they've got the cigars out, they're just sitting back, they can't believe that Liverpool can come back from this situation, and frankly, neither do I on this first half display. Here's Rita, back to Gerard, and Gerard's, slides the pass forward, but it was a lazy pass from Gerard, never likely to reach Baras. Now, Kaka, Kaka, on towards Crespo, Crespo's through, this could be 3-0, and it is 3-0. It's just dinked over the goalkeeper, and Crespo has scored twice in five minutes, and this European Cup final is won by a team that's got his claim, it's seventh title. It's AC Milan 3, Liverpool 0. What about the finish? I mean, it's a great goal in terms of a build-up, lovely through ball, he's a flick round the corner, and it's a great run, and he just dinks it outside of his right foot over Duda. That's an absolutely brilliantly taken goal. You just wonder if Crespo might be wanted back by Chelsea on that finishing. Who was saying about Aaronis before? Was it Pugas saying about Crespo scoring, and winning obviously the competition for AC Milan as a Chelsea player? Well, he says he wants to stay in Italy. I wonder why. This is just absolutely awful for Liverpool, and they're totally shell-shocked at the moment. The other thing, Alan, as well, and we'll have to talk about tactics, it'll be a big, big thing at halftime, is that we talked about Liverpool defensively, very, very good. Without the protection tonight, they've just got a long-to in front of them, without the protection, they're absolutely all over the place. Throw and take it in the far side of the field, Liverpool fans looking to sconce it all around this attitude. They can't believe what has happened. They came with such confidence. They didn't think that AC Milan were favourites to win, but they did feel that their team might just pull it off, and clearly they're not going to pull it off. You're listening to the BBC. commentary from Istanbul. Liverpool free-kick, played into the Milan penalty area, easily headed away by Seydorff. And you've got to think now, has anybody scored a hat-trick in the Champions League final? I don't think so. Or Crespo's on a hat-trick. You know, two goals before halftime. Milan lead 3-0. It's played towards Kafe with the right back, and Treori rather laboured to get across, but the ball beat both of them. It's had a play for a Liverpool throw-in. We've had our 45 minutes, and the signal coming up from the fourth official as to how much time is being added on. Liverpool probably don't want any time to be added on. One minute of stoppage time is being played here in Turkey. Still thinking that? I mean, Milan, without question, deserve their lead, but sometimes it goes for you, and it should have been a penalty for Liverpool. It could have been 1-1 instead. It was 2-0 and quickly became 3-0. Alonso on the halfway line, back to Hoopia. On to Alonso, and Alonso flicks it through. It was a good pass. Schmitzer towards Garcia. Back to Schmitzer. Garcia, good football from Liverpool, but in the end, Garcia's pass, attempted pass, had Parish intercepted, and Milan have the ball, and they've got the cigars out, and they're just rolling amongst themselves, enjoying themselves. It's Flick towards Maldini, who started off this semi-right, and it could become a full-fledged right in the second half, the way play is going. Maldini in towards Nesta, lucky boy. Gattuso flicks it over his shoulder. There is the halftime whistle, and the Lans fans, far fewer than Liverpool inside this stadium, about 12,000, they are celebrating with every reason to celebrate. It's been all Milan in the first half. The opening goal from Maldini after just 52 seconds, then a double from Crespo. Firstly, after Nesta's handball didn't result in a Liverpool penalty, Milan counter-attacked Crespo's goal, and then a brilliant finish from the Argentinian, two minutes before halftime, flicking the ball over Dudek, no chance for Dudek, no chance really for Liverpool. Liverpool 0, AC Milan 3. And as interesting as they were coming off the field, Graham Taylor, that Sammy Hoopier is saying something to the referee, and I think we can probably guess it's about that controversial penalty, which wasn't given Liverpool's way. No, it wasn't, and it's not going to be kippen, and you're 3-0 down, and you've got to get into that dressing room, and you've got to get hold of it, otherwise this is going to be very, very embarrassing. But as much as we speak about Liverpool, AC Milan have been exquisite. You know, that last goal, Kaka does Gerard, and the pass-through and the finish by Crespo, you know, as a football person, you've simply got to appreciate that kind of play. But I really think that tactically, that Liverpool have got to make some alterations. I mean, there's no doubt about it in my mind that Hamann has been greatly missed from the kick-off. Mark Lawrence has spoke about the protection that he would give, and I just think that it's not gone their way at all. John, you were saying when they were 1-0 down Liverpool, if they can get to half-time, then maybe Rafa Benitez can do something about the way they're set up. I know it's easy to say now they're 3-0 down, but why wait till half-time to do it if you can see your sides and trouble the way they are? Well, I think that Rafa, as I said earlier today, has been railroaded a little bit in Premiership to play as a little bit more offensive, which he hasn't been happy with. In the Champions League, he's gone out and played in function of the rivals, and he's felt comfortable on the bench, and all right, people said he's been courses, but you don't just fall out the sky and arrive at the Champions League final. You must have done something right. And I just think tonight that he's gone against a little bit of what he felt he should have done, and they've been at their best with Xavier Alonso and Hamann and Gerard a little bit further forward. They've been there in numbers and they've protected their back for, and they've been solid and hard to break down. Xavier Alonso and Gerard there together, I think, has been too much work for them. The player in front of them hasn't been able to drop back and help them out. The wide players have to come in, give them space for Milan to attack down the sides, and I thought when Cure got injured, Rafa would have maybe seen that and said, hey, hang on a minute, there's 90 minutes here. We've got Hamann or Biscan in there, move Gerard forward, and at least we'll just keep it tight for 20 minutes, half an hour, get to the end of the round if you like, have a look at our cuts, patch them up, and go out and just slowly get ourselves back into the game. But it's just gone from bad to worse, you know, and you could see it that way. I mean, they've had one headed off the line, they've had an awful offside goal there. In second goal, we could see it coming, Liverpool have stayed with a flat back for against two players, which meant they're outnumbered in the midfield. The attacking players have to come further and further back, and they've had too far to go to get to the Milan penalty area. And as you said, he had the perfect opportunity to change it with a Cure injury. Okay, again, as you say, rectifices the sabbios. When you rectify something, if you see a mistake, we all make mistakes, but once you've seen it, the important thing is to put it right as quick as you can. And I have to say, it's very, very unlike Rafa Benitez, what we've seen this 45 minutes in here. Graham, you can tell from John who knows him very well that he's very frustrated, it appears that Rafa Benitez has gone against his instincts, his beliefs, the way he wouldn't actually set his team up, and the result is this game's over. Well, it is over. I mean, at 1-0 it could have been over, because AC Milan say, look, we don't concede, we've won the cup anyhow at 3-0. It is over. It's going to be very interesting to see exactly what he does, because what you don't want is real embarrassment. You've got to come out the second half, and you've got to actually, should I say, win the second half. Even if it stays as a draw, you could still win it in terms of dominating the play and getting yourself right. I just think, you know, from very early days, Maldini has had acres of space down that side, and Finnan, I think, could have stepped forward and pushed in there. John made reference to the fact of four at the back, where Maldini was doing that. Now, somebody had got to stop that outlet, but they've never stopped it, and the spare man, the man that could do it, was at the back, and I think Finnan could have stepped it. Now, I'm a bit surprised that when the substitution was made, as we were talking here, that Hamann didn't come in, because I think they could have not only shored up the midfield, they could have actually then got some instructions into push, bin and on. Thank you very much, indeed. More from Graeme and John Toshlak in a couple of moments' time. There's just been a shot on our monitor of a Liverpool fan, who's obviously spent a lot of money to get here and to buy a ticket with his head in his scarf, and he, and the feeling will be reflected from Liverpool fans listening at home and watching at home and here. He just cannot believe what is going on. Half-time here in the Ataturk Stadium in the Champions League final. It's AC Milan 3, Liverpool 0. It's time for the news. Live news, live sport. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. 5 Live News, I'm Kate Williams, a man who was cleared of the attempted murder of a young boy after spending 25 years in jail, has hit out at the legal system. Paul Blackburn, who's from Warrington, said he wasn't sure if he'd be able to get over what had happened to him. Mr Blackburn's solicitor, Glen Maddox, told 5 Live that the police investigation had been deeply flawed. They had a big inquiry on their hands, that over 2,000 witnesses were statemented, but there was a lot of pressure on them to bring someone to justice, and they felt that they needed to find someone who fitted the bill, unfortunately the person that they got was the wrong person.

O'Neill is standing down after Saturday's Scottish Cup final against Dundee United to take care of his wife, who is ill. However, after five years at Celtic Park, he says he'll miss the club. I'm very sad, obviously, leaving. The five years have, at times, flown in. And at other times they have been the longest five years of my life. But overall, great, great memories of the football club. Fantastic. Cardiff City have confirmed the former Wolves and Southampton boss Dave Jones is their new manager. Tim Hemman has gone out of the French Open tennis at the second round stage, the number seven seed lost in four sets to the Peruvian Lewis Horner. Cricket now and Hampshire captain Shane Warn is regretting his decision to bat first after seeing the championship leaders bowled out cheaply by Warwickshire at Stratford on Avon. Kevin Howells has news of that and the rest of the day's county scores. 184 all out and with Dougie Brown taking four for 59, it wasn't a good day for Hampshire. The pitch was blameless and Warwickshire had the better of the conditions. Of course, you never write off a Shane Warn team, but without the injured bowlers Chris Tremlett and Dmitry Mascarellis. They do face a difficult task from here on. Wickets of Nick Knight and Michael Powell give them some encouragement at the end, Warwickshire 145 for two. L-square knots 410 for eight at Bristol. Rob Key scored a 112, but Kent collapsed 262 all out. Opponent Surrey with 22 for none. Middlesex 327 for eight at Hove. James Curtley taking five for 52. Couple matches in the second division. Northambs 408 all out against Somerset. Martin Love 166 and Ricky Vestal 102 and in Leeds, Centuries 2, Andy Flower and Ronnie Arani of Essex. 308 for five against Yorkshire. And Ashley Giles is out of the first test against Bangladesh, which starts tomorrow at Lord's. The Warwickshire spinner has a hip injury, so Gareth Batty will be taking his place and captain Michael Vaughn will bat at number three. Trial on the news now and on the M25 in Surrey, an accident is blocking two lanes anti-clockwise between junction 11 for Chertsea and junction 10. That's the whizzling to change.

The delays are stretching beyond junction five and the A1 in Bedfordshire. That remains closed northbound between Biggleswade south and Biggleswade north roundabouts after an accident.

It's just tinked over the goalkeeper and Crespo has scored twice in five minutes. And this European Cup final is won by a team that's got its claim in seventh title. It's AC Milan three Liverpool nil. And if you just tuned in, if you've been out, you've missed the first half. Three nil to AC Milan at half time and as Alan was saying, it is surely all over now. There's an enormous Forza Milan flag being unveiled away to our right. And I'm afraid, I don't think it's going to be the story of an amazing triumph for Liverpool in this competition, despite their poor league form. Alan Green, nevertheless, will be here with 6-0-6. Lines open at nine o'clock. 0-500-99-69-3. Text 85058. If you're a Liverpool fan, you may have plenty you want to talk to Alan about, as regards your team's tactical set up for tonight's match. And then at 11, Anita Anansha will come live from Liverpool. Anita, you've got a bit of a rescue job tonight. I'm sorry. Oh dear, oh dear. You know, we had such high hopes in our heart, like lots of people across the country preparing for a big, big party. We thought Liverpool the place to be. We're here. Do you know what? I've never seen a room go so silent, so very quickly. When that first goal went in, then the penalty appeal, then the two subsequent goals, people's spines have developed a really horrific curvature where I'm sitting now. Let's just say this isn't the most upbeat party I've been to, but you know what? We're still optimistic here and we're hoping, come 11 o'clock, we will still be celebrating a famous Liverpool victory. And it's, we've got everything crossed pretty much, everything crossed. We're at the Hope Street Hotel, a place where Rafa Benito's first stayed when he came to Liverpool. We hope that's going to bring us luck. Right now, though, Vasas Alexander, my partner in crime, he's over the road at the Philharmonic Hall, where over 600 fans have been watching the match on a huge screen. Vasas, you were telling me earlier that you heard this great chance at the beginning of the match. You'll never walk and then silence. They never got to the end of that line and the first goal went in. Yeah, there's nothing like a goal against the team you're supporting to kill an atmosphere, of course, but I'll tell you what, 50 seconds it took to go from big party to awake. Every single person here, all wearing red, all waving scarves and flags, everyone was singing, you'll never walk alone. They just never reached the word alone because Paolo Maldini had something to say about that. Literally, you'll never walk and then utter silence here and subdued, shocked, angry, angry with Steven Gerrard. I don't think he's getting stuck in. That's the mood here. I'm not quite as optimistic as you, Anita, but I think we'll have a good party anyway. Yeah, we reds are really rather optimistic, full hardy, some may say, but just cross it and cross it tightly. It'll be fine, Mark. So that's all for now. We'll be back with you a bit later. I know that you will rescue the evening, Anita, in your own inimitable way. Will you have to rescue the evening? I'm afraid you've got no option. No choice. Thank you very much, Anita, from 11 o'clock, Alan Green with 6-0-6 before that. Jon Toshak and Graham Taylor. G-Brell, Cisez, warming up. I think he's coming on. I don't think that would be the biggest surprise. But we have to say, disappointing as it is, Jon, we've just seen the third goal again. A back-heeled turn from Kaka, a fantastic pass, and then the most wonderful dink finish from Crespo. Yeah, that's right, and that probably sums up the 45 minutes that we've seen, you know, that goal. As I say, Liverpool have surprised me as much as they've kept those back four players with the two frontmen, and we've been fought against two out-done completely in the middle of the park. The wide players have tried to come in and help out because the frontmen... And we just, I mean, as I say, very, very unlike Raffer-Benny's type of performance. Are you going to scratch your head for weeks about how he got railroaded into this or why he decided to do this, aren't you? Well, I think we were all surprised when we didn't see the triple at the three, Hamann, Gerard, Chaviolans, or Bisc and Gerard Chaviolans, particularly this type of game against the midfield that Milan had got. Graham, as the Milan players come out briefly, it's all about pride now, as simple as that for Liverpool, isn't it? It is, because, as I said earlier, you've got to sort of rectify something from this game, and what you don't want to come out, you don't want to come out and just be pulled all over the place in the second half, otherwise it's going to be very, very embarrassing. 3-0 down. Well, they need a comeback of Lazarus-type proportions. Here's my kingdom. Well, the centre of the field was always going to be the battleground. Milan dominated it, and Liverpool now, we wait to see what they're going to do about it in terms of changes, but, I mean, the horse has bolted, whatever they do now. Haman is going to come on, and we wonder whether Cece will come on as well, but Haman certainly will be the first change which will be made, and let me just give you the Milan line-up while we sort out the Liverpool team. Dida, Kaffu, Stam, Nesta, Maldini, Perlo, Gattuso, Seidorf, Kaka, who was outstanding, Shevchenko, and Crespo, two goals against Manchester United, and now two goals against Liverpool. The Liverpool fans at least singing their anthem. A couple of flares, once more, smoke drifting across the stadium. Liverpool defending the goal away to our left. I think what they're going to do in Liverpool is, Finnan's gone off, I think Reesa goes to left-back, Treyori steps inside as a centre-back alongside Hupen. I would have thought Jamie Karagher will come and play right back. Right, so Dudeck, Karagher, Huppier, Treyori, Alonso, Luis Garcia, Gerard, Reesa, Smitsa, Haman and Barros. No, Cece hasn't come on yet at the start of the second half. So we'll have a good long look at this, but it's 3-0 to Milan, and if you just think it's the second half gets underway, Champions League history alone, since the Champions League began. Well, the biggest win was Milan's 4-0 against Barcelona in 1994. There have been a couple of 3-0 victories, but already, second half under way, Maldini stretching Liverpool down this near side. They feel the ball almost breaking there for Kaka, and Liverpool who need to start the second half, well, already on the defensive. Well, Smitsa's playing right side, normally right side, I have no idea where he went to, Mike. Started the second half after all that had happened in the first half, and he just completely fell to sleep. Alonso Green talking about the potential for Crespo to get a hat-trick, as we welcome World Service to 5 Live. There hasn't been a hat-trick in the Champions League final. The last hat-trick was scored by Prati of Milan in 1969. And of course, Di Stefano and Puskas got hat-tricks too a little earlier in the competition. This is the 50th European Cup final, and so far, alas, it's been one of the most one-sided. AC Milan 3, Liverpool 0, and Milan beginning the second half, the way they left off the possession. Long ball forward, away by Hopiart. Haman, who's belatedly come into this game, controls the ball on the edge of the penalty area, but they missed his protection, his screening. And even before they scored after only 52 seconds, for me, it was kind of summed up right from the kick-off. Traorey's first touch was lamentable. It was just so edgy, and it just demonstrated all the anxiety that seemed to be down there early on as Milan took control. And now here comes Steven Gerard, short of a half-wheeler. Oh, into the unmarked Garcia. Not a very good first touch, though, from the Spaniard. It wasn't a great return from Gerard, but he's turned it into something, and then he runs out of play over on the far side, and it's an allowed throw. Well, the other thing is well about Haman, and a little bit after the horse has bolted, but you've watched Liverpool throughout Europe this year, which we have done, and even when they haven't played well, when they've had the two players in front of the back four, what it's always done, it's A, giving them a defensive platform, and B, when they've not played particularly well, they haven't conceded, and it's given them time and allowed them to play themselves back into games. Vladimir Smitser finds his fellow countryman Baros, but he's easily crowded out by Milan and Nesta to Stam. Stam's ball eventually drops to get to someone. Now Seydov picks up the ball down this near side of the field. Shevchenko peals away to this near side of the left. Crespo sensing a hat-trick, of course, was waiting just on the edge of the area, but Liverpool dispossess Shevchenko, and it's gone back to Dudeck once more. Liverpool needing to start the second half, and just to give them something here to build on. Smitser, Maldini immediately confronts Smitser, and the pressure coming in from the Milan midfield players, Milan with Kakar and Seydov, and Kakar again stretching the Liverpool side, comes to Crespo a little deeper this time, and now Gattuso, the worker in midfield, crossed to Kaffu on the far side of the field, Milan taking charge right at the start of the second half. As Gattuso feeds Kaffu, Kaffu loops the ball in, and it bounces awkwardly for Dudeck. Crespo's got it, Kaffu has a strike, goes off Hopi for a corner kick, to Milan. Well, I don't know, it seemed to come from where we are, it seemed to come off Dudeck's knees, I thought for a second it might just have clipped the post. No, it came off his knees, and he was actually going behind the goal line to save it. Well, it's not a very encouraging start to the second half here by Liverpool, need to get the heads up here. It's a corner kick to Milan, far side, Perlo to take it, Japs Stam's gone forward, in comes the kick, hasn't been dealt with, Maldini slams it back in again, clearance by Hopi, Nesta, big high ball back in, and they're still on side, over on the far side, Perlo faced by Risa, and Milan seem to be winning it all the time in midfield. Another ball played in to the dangerous Kaka, Seydor, looking to try and release Shevchenko. Liverpool stretch back inside their own half, the ball with Schmitzer down this near side of the field. Schmitzer finding Hopi and now to comparative safety with Alonso, Alonso did Gerrard. Liverpool now trying to pass and move with Vladimir Schmitzer inside the centre circle, he's surrounded by white shirts from Milan, Seydor looking to win it back again. He's held up though by Alonso who does well, and now triori, triori, that's a good ball for Liverpool, finding John Arnaurisa over on the far side, into Steven Gerrard, doesn't control it first time. Gerrard though thwarted by Nesta, still gets the ball in, headed away by Japs Stam. Liverpool still keep possession with Haman, Haman now finding Alonso. Alonso 15 yards inside the... Schottkums in just wide! Reaching effort there from Jaby Alonso, Dider took off, and it's a goal kick, and that's the best effort in the entire game so far from Liverpool. The referee's assistant's flag went up, I don't know for what, it's a great strike by Alonso, Dider didn't see it until very late indeed, and obviously on the target that was in. Well that's better, that it's looking up at the scoreboard, the reality here, AC Milan 3, Liverpool 0 on 5 live and BBC World Service, John Arnaurisa, were live from Istanbul, English team in the European Cup final for the 12th time, they've won it of course virtually every time they've played in the final, the two exceptions, 1975 and 1985, and here we are in 2005, and I'm afraid unless we get the most incredible responses now from Liverpool in the last 40 minutes of this game, they're not going to win it in 2005 either, and UEFA are not going to be bothered to have to make that decision about whether Liverpool should play in the competition next season. The ball is back with Huppier, short of the half-way line, and now it's right over, he's let it slip, summing up his evening really, he's put Milan back on the attack again, Milan are going forward with Kaka, who's been fouled on the edge of the area by Sammy Huppier, and it's a free kick to Milan, and that was just wretched defending by the man who's holding his hand up now, acknowledging it, Jimmy Treyori. Well the other thing as well, Huppier might even get away without a card, I mean at the very least it's a yellow, but I think the referee's taken pity on him thank goodness. It's interesting that Raphael Benitez decided to take off thin and a not Treyori at half-time, I wonder why he decided to keep Treyori on bearing in mind that he's hardly done anything right down there in the first half. It's going to be Shevchenko in the meantime, getting involved in this free kick, no question about that. He's got the sort of Alan Shearer build hasn't he, he strikes the ball viciously like Shearer does, he's standing at the moment just away from Perlo and Seydor. Yep, Stan is there too, but this is a free kick to Milan, just about three or four yards outside the penalty area. Crespo looking for some sort of ricochet inside the area too. Referee just dragging the Liverpool wall back another inch or two, but Shevchenko is poised, and it's certainly going to be set up for him, there's no question about that, Shevchenko's waiting, and then it goes from Shevchenko, saved by Dudek, real pile driver from Shevchenko, turned around by Dudek for a corner. Excellent strike under all sorts of pressure Shevchenko, I mean Baras came to charge the kick down, I think with Mavin Jamie Karagin, a good save by Baras, sorry by Dudek. Well he may never realise his international ambition Shevchenko in the World Cup with Ukraine, but he's on the verge of winning the European Cup for a second time here, and his team Milan have a corner kick leading by three goals to nil over on the far side of the field, they give it plenty of height and Haman doesn't really control the defensive header, Maldini just for once doesn't get hold of it either near side, but he's going to come back and nevertheless still dispossess Alonso, typical Maldini, Maldini fires the ball in, Liverpool on the edge of their own area, it's away from Gerard, and now Reza can race onto this one, Reza crosses the halfway line, he's only got Baras ahead of him though, he needs support here Reza, he's got Gattuso breathing down his neck, in the end it's back into midfield, and with Alonso on the edge of the centre circle, Haman, Liverpool ought to get a bit more possession now, with Alonso, Haman and Gerard, Alonso through the referee's legs to Reza over on the left hand side, Reza can't get the first ball in, another opportunity from Reza, header, Joel, yes a goal from Stevan Gerard of Liverpool, Stevan Gerard with a header, breathes new life into Liverpool and he waves to the fans over on the far side, come on believe, Milan 3, Liverpool 1, maybe a route back through Stevan Gerard. Well it's the second cross from Reza, the first one, hit Catherine on the back side, second one he managed to miss, he's a great header by Stevan Gerard, just really took the pace off it and drifted it over, did a wonderful finish. Well that's woken them up and Milan have conceded, which they don't do very often in football matches, but well there's still time maybe for the impossible to happen here, eight minutes gone in the second half, that was exactly what Liverpool required, just as Milan were threatening to go even further clear here in this final, AC Milan 3, Liverpool 1, it's still almost mission impossible really here for Liverpool, but now can they give, can that goal give them some sort of belief? And we were mentioning that Haman and Alonso and Gerard would give them a little more possession, eventually Reza got the ball in second time down the left hand side, and now Treyore, nothing spectacular from him, goes to the more creative players in midfield, and it's down this near side the field and Smitsa, how much longer will they leave Cece out of the game, they may need his leadership up front as well, ball now with Carragher, Carragher to Haman, Milan have got everybody back inside their own heart, Treyore now, flicked on from Garcia, oh Barros has just given offside, they're not aware of it yet, the flag has got up near side the field, the referee hasn't stopped the game, Seydorff's clearance on Milan haven't benefited from that at all, because Treyore finds Reza once more, Reza can't get the cross in, Liverpool have a throw in over on the far side. Well the other thing as well Matt, Milan can't complain because they have four or five different attempts to get rid of the ball. Haman 25 yards out, doesn't shoot, but Smitsa might all the way from Vladimir Smitsa! What's more like it here in Istanbul, the game seem to be all over at halftime, but Gerard's header and Vladimir Smitsa spectacular effort through Dider, maybe it's not mission impossible after all, Milan 3, Liverpool 2. No pressure on Liverpool as well in terms of being able to just pick his spot, came from Haman, little touch out of his feet, lovely strike, low to Dider's right hand side, he got his hands on it, arguably should have said it doesn't matter, just got a little touch off Baros maybe on the way as well. Well they may still have a party after all on Merseyside this evening, now we saw what PSV Einhuben did to Milan's defenders in the semi-final, really trouble them and the pressure told, Graham Taylor. Well the change of tactics is so obvious and so good, he's gone almost to three centre backs, Kariga, Hupia and Traore with Fyker as a wing back and Reeser is played in their half ever since the kick off as their wing back and they've really now penned them back, I mean tactically I'm sure he wishes that he'd even started this way because he really has taken the game to them and it's a great change by the manager. No team has come from 3-0 down in the European Cup final to win the trophy, this is the 50th and Liverpool have a corner kick down this near side of the field, even Gerard and Vladimir Smitser, two players, there's been so much speculation of course who may not be at Anfield next season, have scored the goals here in the final and Liverpool have a corner kick and Gerard their inspirational captain is going to take it for them. It comes very deep and it's played in by Alonso, the ball bouncing awkwardly for the Milan defenders but an offside is given. It can begin against three or four of the Liverpool players. What about you Mike? I'm thinking Alivezia. Well this is just, I mean they've just got to keep it going now because Milan of course when they've got the control and they can just dictate the way they want to in midfield are almost unbeatable but Liverpool just have to keep mounting the pressure here. They're certainly going to get more of a platform with Hermann and Alonso and Gerard and Riso made the first goal for Steven Gerard, Riso getting the challenge over on the far side from Coutusso and just at the moment the decisions are going against Milan and now Liverpool have a throw just inside the AC Milan half, three-nil down at half-time. In fact it could have been even worse than three-nil, Cepchenco had a goal ruled out, there were other opportunities cleared off the line as well, Rafa Albanita stands and points and now Smitzer with the ball to Alonso and Liverpool having much much more possession. Thirteen and a half minutes gone in the second half in Istanbul and now we're here the Liverpool fans but they try already another very edgy ball from him out of play and need to keep the pressure going. Now you just wonder what Ancelotti's a what he's thinking and b what he does to counter this if anything in terms of players on and players off. Well isn't it amazing? The fear was that this would be dull, that the two sides would retreat from the kickoff, it would be a stalemate, we talked about the possibility of it even going to penalties, well it still may go to penalties but we've had five goals, we may have more and it's Jamie Carragher for Liverpool into Baros. Baros, Gerard's there, Gerard goes down on the challenge and the penalties been given. We have not even played 15 minutes of the second half and Liverpool three-nil down at half-time have got the penalty, Steven Gerard was steaming on to that, the challenge came in from behind, well now hang on a minute what's happening here, Liverpool players are appealing maybe they haven't been given the penalty. No they have, the other thing as well, Gattuso it was you pulled Gerard but what are they complaining about? He needs to go off surely, he needs to go off. Well the Milan players are arguing the referee from Spain is at the moment just losing it down there, nobody seems to know what on earth is happening, it's a penalty but it's going to be Javi Alonso, Javi Alonso who was given his opportunity of course with John Toschak who's with us here this evening, Real Sociedad for his fellow countryman and manager Rafael Bonites. Alonso can complete the most remarkable turnaround here up against the enormous Dida, the Brazilian in the goal, Alonso, misses but Alonso puts in the rebound, Alonso's there for the rebound, Dida make the first save but Alonso was the first to react, he goes down on the turf, he's being hugged by the men in red and this scoreline is absolutely staggering, AC Milan 3, Liverpool 3. Actually it was a decent penalty, it was a wonderful, wonderful save but well done Javi Alonso, he's the first one up to it, made no mistake left but it's a great penalty save that by Dida, brilliant but that was Alonso to finish it off. But I still say Mike Gattuso should have been sent off, Milan should have 10 players. Well we talked about the spirit of 77 and 78 and 81 and 84, the most incredible thing about this was that I didn't think the Liverpool actually started the second half particularly well it wasn't as if Bonites had had some magic effect on them but then suddenly, suddenly they got it back again with this system that we, I know it sounds wise after the event, we felt they should have played right from the start but now Liverpool have to concentrate because back come Milan in this open game but now Alonso hits it long and Barras is given offside. John Toschak, what do you make of this? Well I'm absolutely delighted of course, I mean recently the first half was never that far forward to put a cross in the box and Gerard couldn't get that far forward to stick it in, he's been brought down for the penalty, he scored the second goal himself and we talked about Liverpool leaving four players at the back with two, they push Risa forward, Kanaka, Kipi and Triori have taken over two, Hamon of course has allowed Gerard to get further forward, he's made Chaviel also a little bit more comfortable in the game, he's completely turned on, it's said they bolted the door after Alonso had gone out but Alonso had come back in. It's a free kick to Milan, Liverpool have to be careful and the shot is driven in by Seidelph just wide, whatever happens now though, Liverpool have redeemed themselves here, 3-3 we thought it was exciting in Barcelona, well I've got to tell you this one is even beating that at the moment, I mean because this just, at half time to be honest Mark, I honestly thought how many more are Milan going to get? Well we all thought Liverpool going to come back. We all thought it's important now for Liverpool because they've got back at it to keep going, do not surrender the impetus, the impetus is with Liverpool, they must keep going forward and they still have Cece obviously and they still have to keep the pressure on this Milan side because they are not comfortable when they're under this kind of onslaught, Xavi Alonso, Liverpool at the moment using the PSV blueprint if you like because they troubled AC Milan really, I mean they were lucky to get through in the end in that semi-final when Milan turned them in, when PSV turned them inside out in Einhoven, Benitez trying to keep his cool down there, watching Hoopier, he will be aware that Liverpool still have to concentrate but here comes John Honorisa for Liverpool, shot driven in, turn up in the air by Dida, great power there from the Norwegian and Dida comes in to make the second save as Barros comes steaming in looking for the bits and pieces, good little ball from Steven Gerrard as well into his path but look how much time and space he's got in order to pick his spot. This game is going all over the world of course and what box office entertainment it's, let me tell you by the way, nearly 10 past 11 in the evening here in Istanbul smoke still drifting in from the flares away to Aleph which should not be in the stadium but the Liverpool fans are all up and Yapstam, one of those shell-shocked Milan defenders finds Gattuso inside the centre-circle and now Kappu who, I mean, significantly hasn't been coming forward at all since the restart, you're listening to Five Live and BBC World Service, one of the most dramatic European cup finals the 50th, it's 3-3 after Liverpool trail 3-0 at half time, Maldini scoring after just 52 seconds, two goals from Crespo, now Seydorf for AC Milan, danger still of course from the Italians, Seydorf wants more near the corner flag but Kerriga comes across to close him down and Milan have a throw in and they just need a little breather themselves here as some Ancelotti tries to sort things out as well throw in taken by Seydorf, it's anybody's European cup now, maybe Liverpool will be playing in the competition after all next season having been written off prematurely here and Perlow, the man who really orchestrated everything in the first half, long ball forward looking for Shepchenko, in goes Hoppea with a very important challenge, slides the ball away from Shepchenko and now Risa down the far side of the field, John Arisa plays the ball through the Milan players legs and this is a completely different side now we're watching from Liverpool, Smica near side of the field, Holes and then hits it long, looks to try and pick out Barros, Barros has it taken away from him in the air by Kappu and now the ball with Maldini who gave Milan that breathtaking start, measured ball from Maldini, Crespo under pressure doesn't have anything like as much time but the referee's penalised Liverpool, Foul on Seydorf and Milan have a free kick. Well the Milan they filled in the first half was absolutely brilliant but now Liverpool are just cutting the sway through it, they look every time Liverpool have the ball they look completely depleted and devoid of numbers in there, well Alan Green rightly so in the commentary I would have done the same thing when Crespo scored the second, virtually said wins the European cup for Milan because that was the way it was going to be, 3-0 to Milan, could have been even more in the first half, 3-3 now and a little bit of defensive work for Carragher to do, he was left on his backside in the movement which led to one of those Crespo goals, the second one made by Shepchenko and Kaka and now Maldini trying to use his experience down there preparing with a throwing down the Milan left. Maldini just taking his time then feeds Clarence Seydor, Maldini now into Seydor, Seydor under pressure from Luis Garcia on the edge of the area, Garcia's clearance, there's a big gap between Barosh and the midfield and they'll hand pick it up once more, challenge comes in on Perlo from Barosh and the referee gives the free kick, we play 21 and a half minutes of an absolutely amazing second half here in Istanbul, Liverpool suddenly winning the tackles in midfield and now get too so fine to Maldini, suddenly Milano just having a few more moments on the ball, hope that's not ominous for Liverpool, it's gattuso, looking to try and thread it forward to Shepchenko, it might run instead to Clarence Seydor, no it won't, it's a goal kick but just a few signs mark that Milano started to get back into it again. Well you know what they're doing Mike, they've got the passing going again and obviously not on that particular occasion in terms of being simpler because it was wasteful but the midfield players are all starting to have a little tucks, they tried to get Kaffu down the right, Maldini's come down this left hand side as well and it looked at the moment as though they've weathered the storm a little bit. Well there's so much a tempo team AC Milan, Liverpool must continue to disrupt that tempo as Heman, oh what's this gone, from the referee it was a handball and it's going to be a free kick to Milan on the half wayline, Liverpool must still apply themselves in the way that they were doing in the previous 15 minutes here, Milan start to get a bit more of a foothold once more, Milan 3, Liverpool 3 and Kaffu significantly coming forward once more, Huppier against Shepchenko, Liverpool looking to clear and looking to try and hit them on the break, long one from Alonso which is cut out by Alessandro Nesta, ball is over on the far side of the field and Milan suddenly committing a few more players forward, Perlo just inside the Liverpool half, which way is it going to go, next goal absolutely crucial it's Maldini from Milan near side, Maldini taking on the Liverpool defenders, his cross comes in, it's a goal kick to Jesy Dudeck and I'll go and have a gargle and here's Alonso Green. Well from being one of the most one-sided European Cup Finals in history, we are possibly on the verge of the greatest ever European Cup Final, Liverpool can believe and I was saying it 3-2 to Mark Alonso and I nudged him, I said Mark Basil, Basil with 3-0 up against Liverpool, Liverpool pulled back to 3-3, but that was a far lower stage, far far lower stage than this, 3-3, it was a stunning opening quarter of an hour to the second half, thank you Mike, Carriger for Liverpool, in to Gerard, Gerard who set the comeback on its way, that's a good ball by Alonso, then Garcia stepped away from Catoza who shouldn't be on the pitch, Catoza gets in another challenge, wins the ball back, Perlo to Catoza and now Nesta, he should have had a penalty against him for the handball in the first half, having said that Milan were well worth their 3-0 lead at half time, it's just a remarkable game of football. Troyory dives in and the referee, I think that was harsh, he gives a free kick. I think he read exactly what Cappu was going to do and his long legs just nicked the ball away from him, the referee's assistant who was close and navigated but the referee did. And the free kick isn't from there Cappu, Gonzales the referee tells, it's not from there either for goodness sake, that was even worse than where Cappu took it from, it's now with the left back Baldini who got the scoring underway, after 52 seconds, Seydor on to Kaka, good ball in by Kaka, Duneck spills in, Hesiptenko cleared from Jesto, in front of the line by Troyory, Duneck was at fault. Well the last two stages had to make him spill both, the other one by the near post that came, it seemed to come off his knees and then really as though somebody went across his eye line, it was just a simple little ball played in, little flick and he was nowhere near it, well done Troyory. Corner to Milan, played in, headed clear by Risa and then that was a wild effort from Nesta, high and well wide of goal and it's scarcely believable that from half time, and here we are we've got 20 minutes to go, Liverpool 3, AC Milan 3, the Milan fans cannot believe what has happened in the second half mark. Well as well, went the three, won the put on the Friday night, they nearly played a different team in terms of their own selection but there were three, one up and that came back to 3-3. I just wonder when he might be tempted to bring on Cece, I think Baros is beginning to look a little tired, he's given so much effort, sometimes rather wasted effort Baros but no one can deny his work rate, balls out of play, Milan, Curlis on the far side, Crespo, we were talking about Crespo being on the verge of a half-trick, now he might be on the verge of being a loser in a final in which his team played 3-0 at half time, but there's still a long way to go in this match, Schrieitzer who got the second Liverpool goal, hits it upfield, not cleared properly, here's Gerard running onto it, Gerard flashes in the shot but that's over the crossbar, Gattuso was really stretching to keep with Steven Gerard, it's a goal kick. You know remember that goal they scored against Middlesbrough the other week, it was another sort of 5-10 yards further on, it wasn't too dissimilar in terms of the effort. Goal kick to Milan, Dider to take it, I'm trying to think about the goals and the Dider fault for any of them, no he actually made a very good save from Alonso's penalty. I thought he should have stopped Schmitz, he's got his hand to it. There's surely a push by Cacca on the Haman it is, and suddenly I have to remind you, I don't know what time 6-0-6 is going to happen the way this is going on, the lines are open for 6-0-6, 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, I'll be on the air to 1 o'clock local time at least, and the producer for 5-5 throws a bit of paper at me. Alonso to Pupia, and now Carragher, Milan having weathered that storm, well, thunderstorm, again came back in it, and now Liverpool appear to have a grip on the game once more. Yeah, they settled down for a few minutes, got the little triangles going, Milan, but now if anything they seem to have sat back again. It's with Alonso, some great passes from Javier Alonso, here's another one, Schmitz is on the right side, Schmitz let the ball run, just inches in from the right touch line, two quick from Maldini, Maldini, now dived in and Seidorff dived in, and there hasn't been a yellow card tonight, that was a bad challenge by Seidorff on Jeroff. Well, the referee's tried to let the game go on, but you rightly say Gattuso should have been sent off for the foul in the penalty area on Steven Jeroff, there's no argument in the rules. Free kick to Liverpool, Antjolotti's not looking very happy at the moment, Schmitzer from the right, just plays it into Alonso, immediately back to Schmitzer, he's gained a few yards, Alonso again, Alonso then dinks it into the penalty area, Garcia pulls it under control, not completely under control, Alonso gets the ball back, and then there must have been a flag from the line for a foul by Garcia, I think he's right. I'm not sure about that, Seidorff seemed to just dwell on the ball a little bit and almost seemed to fall backwards. They're rocking in defence, they are rocking AC Milan, well, I mean there was sort of hand on body there by Garcia on Seidorff, free kick anyway, 17 minutes to go, five live in the World Service on the BBC, three-three between Liverpool and AC Milan in the European Cup final, Risa back to Treore, Treore to Juppia, and there's no doubt that Milan are just sitting there at the moment, they feel they'll get another chance, now Schmitzer on the right, in towards Garcia, Garcia back to Schmitzer, lovely football, Schmitzer then gets away from Gattuso, Schmitzer still running, there's a shot, left foot but doesn't keep it down, and it's wide and it's a goal kick. But again Alonso, a Liverpool midfield player running from the corner. Running quite deep, a little bit of a one-two, yes, all right, Fortuitous-Bobble, but nobody from the Milan back four able to come and close people down, which is how Schmitzer got his goal. Both these teams before the final only conceded six goals each, and here, three goals they conceded, both of them, tonight, here in Istanbul. Foul there, by Crespo on Alonso, free kick taken, Juppia to Haman. It would be easy to say that it's Haman's presence that transformed it, but Liverpool certainly look at a great deal more solid with Haman in midfield or alongside Alonso, Gerard pushing forward. Well I think also once you say go to three at the back and stick Risa up, it sends the positive signals out to everybody, and let's just have a three-nil down, you've got to go for it. Well, you've absolutely no option. I've got to say at half time I was thinking, can Liverpool keep this to a respectable scoreline? Any scoreline seemed possible the way Milan were playing and the way Liverpool were playing. Goal kick to AC Milan. There I claimed them, seven times winners of the European Cup. A three-nil, you've got to do that. No longer, three goals and six minutes from Liverpool, Gerard after 54, Schmitz are after 56 and Alonso with the penalty, his first effort saved by Dita but he snapped them with a rebound, took it very well. Haman, lovely ball to Garcia, Garcia then, Suss past Nesta, crosses high, he thought Barrett should continue the run, end of the penalty area and Graham Taylor, let's bring you in. What are your thoughts on what's happened here? Well I think it's great to see an England team not playing 4-4-2 to show that you can do it, because that's been a big turn for me. They've got their three centre-backs in, they've got their four midfield players. Gerard now is making sure that Perlo's not running the game for them. Garcia going anywhere, dropping off Barris. There's much more fluidity about the Liverpool side and far more attacking options. It's been an absolutely superb tactical switch at the half-time but like all of us, we think it probably should have been earlier at the start of the game. While you were talking Graham, the first yellow card of the evening and it was a deserved yellow for Jamie Carrick, his challenge is very high. It's a free kick to AC Milan, we've got 14 minutes to go and we might yet have extra time, we might yet have penalties but we might have a dramatic winner for one of those two teams out there. The ball is back with Kaka and Kaka's ball in field, not great. Alonso is there, has played away, has hit Alonso, brilliantly played by Haman, shielding it, all towards Garcia. Nesta gets in there first, Nesta finds Caffu on the far side of the field into Catoosa, Catoosa to Perlo. Perlo hits it down the right side towards Chevchenko but Torori was across there and Torori is many faults but Speed is not one of them, he gets to the ball before Chevchenko and the ball's out of play for Throwett. And recovery speed as well, just at the moment as well Milan, nice intercut passing midfield, the final ball's been wasteful for them. Reza hits it out of play there, he was trying to hook it in towards Baros, it's a throw in to AC Milan, Benitez, now in consultation with his staff, sitting on the bench in the dugout and Cialotti is way out there towards the touchline. He cannot believe what has happened in his second half, Milan looks so comfortable. 13 minutes to go, again the final ball is not good from Milan, Maldini over hit that pass, well beyond Crespo, two goals before half time from Crespo. They're just trying to force things now whereas in the first half they would keep the ball, keep the ball, work Liverpool, work them and then split them with the opening, they're not doing that. Dutek with the clearance left footed, Gerard Niel wasn't going to reach him but it breaks now off Milan head to Schmitzer, Schmitzer to Karagher. Karagher's been playing centre of defence all season, suddenly finds himself playing on the right side of a three, Reza's certainly in midfield, Throwett down the lap, Karagher down the right and hope he'll be between them, hope he'll be on to Alonso. They're doing extremely well because both the sides of the three centre defenders, Karagher right, Thriveau in left, are splitting and coming in playing on the touchline and they're stretching Milan and they're getting out all the time. Well Stam was stretched there but the linesman, who I think has made a few dubious decisions actually about offside, he gives offside against Baruch, Baruch and Nesta round across behind Stam. Anywhere the free kick goes to Milan, it's taken and then Nesta, on the kafu on the far side of the field, kafu, just short of the half way line, into Seidor and Seidor hits it long aimed at Schiffchenko but Baruch in, Karagher bollies it away, hope he clears two, headed back by Catooso, hope he'll be over the brilliant header, on to Gerard, Gerard to the left side and Reza, who thought about hitting a first time crossfield pass, changes mind, it's back with Thriveau and to the goalkeeper Dutek on his left foot, his favourite foot, Dutek out to Karagher, 11 minutes to go. Benitez is now out again in that technical area, urging his side with tactical instruction, Alonso, Alonso to Hamar, Liverpool's midfield looks so much better in the second half, Alonso to Gerard on the far side, suddenly the trio are running it, Gerard, offfield, Garcia onside, trying to chest it back towards Baruch, didn't get it quite right and Milan survived Milan clear. He looks slightly confused at the ball actually came all the way through and yet for me you could see where it was going. Danger here, Liverpool, Schiffchenko comes forward, he's got back through the fenders, on into the fenders here, Crespo is there, Crespo pulls it back towards Kaka, great tackle by Karagher. I'll tell you what, it's brilliant by Karagher because you wait and see the replay, he waits to see, he offers the Milan player to slide it on his left hand side and he just waits and he reads this absolutely brilliantly, he knows where this is going to go, he's sticking in there and he goes to the right and he gets it up, brilliant. Spitzer takes a slide, a swig of a water bottle but that's only to get across here to get fresh instruction from Rafa Benitez. How much longer before he brings Cece on? What do you think? I think he's going to wait a little bit but this team, this 11th, the second half have just pulled three goals back. Ten minutes left here, in Istanbul, ten minutes of normal time, and it's a foul by Barosh and Barosh may well be booked, he is being booked, second player of the evening, I think he's in the referee's judgment for a persistent foul played by Barosh. Yeah, well... And Katoosso's on the pitch. Well, the referee's got it right, wrong on two occasions for me, certainly. First it should have been a penalty for handball by Nesta and then there was a penalty for Katoosso's last ditch foul on Gerard who was clean through into the penalty area, and he's given a yellow card for Katoosso. The Spanish referee has got those decisions wrong. Nine minutes left, Milan inside Liverpool's half, Cafeu just plays it beyond the Liverpool play, in goes Troyori again, and not only does he win the tackle, he wins the throw in playing it off Cafeu out of play. Well, that's just... he's better when he has something or somebody definitive to mark. That's the thing about Troyori, when he gives him space and time and giving the ball, he gives it back to you but in this particular role he's done well in the second half. And what great credit we must offer to John Toshak who looked at this Liverpool line-up and said, yes, they can play a three. Now, Milan should have goal, Cepchenco appeals that his shot was deflected off-carrier. It wasn't, it's a goal kick. I mean, Mark, well, you're only nine minutes away now from an extra 30-minute, Cisec's coming on. He's not waiting until extra time, he's bringing Cisec on, I think that must be for Barrow. You would certainly have thought so, unless of course it's Garcia, but I would certainly say with Liverpool and Benitez, his substitutions in the second half have basically got the team back in this game. Well, it was just the one substitute to remember. It was bringing on her man, taking off, changing the shape of the defence, changing the course of the game, three-three. John, what are your thoughts? Well, I think we say as well, you know, prevention's better than cure. And Rafa knows, even he wouldn't have expected such a dramatic turnaround in this, but I think you've put a lot, we've got Southerjee a bit of pride, I haven't kicked him myself because of the mistake I've made. What I'm going to do is put Haman alongside Shavi and let him enjoy himself, something that he hasn't been able to do with Gerard, push Risa further forward, player three at the back, and all of a sudden, I mean, even though you'd expect things to be a lot better, they never could have expected the team to score three goals in six minutes in a Champions League final. And now I can't see a way back for Milan, to be honest with you. Shriza to Gerard, back to the halfway line and Karagar. Cise has got his tracks off, but he can't get on yet until play is held up. Pupya to Haman, and the tosser from the Liverpool fans, Liverpool struck the ball around, successive passes amongst Red Shirts. And we might have a couple of changes that I would have thought from Milan, to Rui Costa is a perfect, I'd have my team. Well, I think that they're looking at Thomas and Jondal Thomas, and then maybe Seginio as well. But we'll see. Gerard, heads it towards the left side, towards Risa, Risa jumps, heads it down, Kaffir cleverly ran in to Risa, as he made the header, and the ball to Liverpool, Buz goes to AC Milan. Here's Maldini, and Maldini slips it through. That's a great ball in towards Crespo. Pupya carefully heads it away, finds Karagar, Karagar needing delay, finding Gerard, and now back to Alonso, and the cheers, reserves, Liverpool are in possession. We've got six and a half minutes left for playing this dramatic final here in Istanbul. Liverpool three, AC Milan three, Milan were three-nil up at half-time, and they could have been four or five up the way the game was going. Back it goes to Tudek for Liverpool. Tudek just waits inside his penalty area. There are a couple of changes lined up. Thomason is coming on, and so too, you rightly say, is Seginio. Seize, in fact, there are three substitutes, when you come on, and they're all going to come on now. So it'll be interesting to see what the changes are. Another thing for Liverpool, this is the last throw of the dice, isn't it? It is. Milan will still have another change to make if they need so. Seize coming on first for Baros, no surprise. Well, yeah, like for like, certainly. Baros has worked extremely hard, he spoke about it before. He really, really, really has worked his socks off for the course. You know, at half-time, as Baros breaks his way off, he's got a route seven names down. Players, I thought, at that stage of this competition might never play another game for Liverpool. Tudek, Hul, Treori, Schmitzer, Baros, Hamad, and perhaps most significantly of all, Gerard. What chance now? Baros is off, Seize is off. Now here are the Milan changes, no surprise. Jandale Thomason comes off for Crespo, no hat-trick for Crespo. And Jandale Thomason will probably play off, Chef Cenkow would have thought, giving them an option of sort of, you know, in between midfield and attack and maybe setting a little problem for Hamad in that area. And who does Serginia replace? Seidorf, Clarence, is actually standing an inch from the touchline. I think he knows it. Seidorf is off. Well, he might yet get another Champions League medal. He's one of three different clubs, remember, Seidorf. Some observers wonder what exactly he does, you know? What does Seidorf do apart from collect Champions League winners medals? He's certainly a contrary animal, I know that. Now, it's hit forward from Milan, his play resumes. We've got five minutes to go, plus stoppage time, of course. Treori hits it over the halfway line. Seize, who's a completely different animal to Baros, challenging Stam in the air, but the ball goes out of play. It's a throw-in to Milan. Milan, Stam throws to Nesta. And now here's Maldini. And have Milan gone to a three now? That's what appears to have happened to me. Caffer is certainly pushing forward down the right. Serginia down the left. I think it's early to say that, Alan, because Caffer just bombs on anyway. Yeah, I think it's still a four with Rijon Dal-Thompson, just off Shevchenko. Here's Serginia, controlling the ball midway inside the Liverpool half. Four minutes left for play. Serginia goes down. Was it a foul by Schmitzert? No, it wasn't. And it's a throw-in to Liverpool. It went down rather easily, didn't it? Now, remember, there's no silver goal or golden goal anymore. If they're level at the end of the normal 90 minutes plus stoppage time, we have 30 minutes of extra time. And then, if they're still level, penalties will decide this Champions League final, as it did two years ago at Old Trafford, when there were no goals at the end of 120 minutes. Serginia on there, and that's perfectly played by Milan. Brilliant tackle by Haman. Haman's done well. Cece takes it off, inside his own half. Cece moves into the Milan half. She was over too much in the ball, but encourages the challenge and wins the throw-in for Liverpool. We've got three minutes to go. I've just got his head up. There was a cut that passes on inside, but you can understand with his first touch, he wants to get himself into the game as quickly as possible. It seems an awful long time ago, but I suggest that when Milan led 1-0, don't forget about the occasion when a certain team came from behind to win the match in stoppage time. 2-1 Manchester United, 1-1 Barcelona. Liverpool of the ball, Reesa with Cece ahead of him. And Garcia in there. Garcia, a fix at pass, wonderful. Almost got passed the second, but Milan regroup, get the ball, and they bring it away. He was actually unlucky, Garcia. The problem was Milan had broken, unfortunately, now Liverpool are just slowing them down a little bit. Pirlo is pushing further forward and seeing a lot more of the ball. Pirlo feeds it through to Shevchenko. Shevchenko now. Running through the defence, Carragher must make the tackle, does make the tackle, and successfully puts the ball behind for a corner. Brilliant play. Don't forget, he's on the right side in terms of centre-back. He saw straight away, spotted the danger, who feels he's going to be beaten and outstretched right leg. You know, Ericsson seems to prefer Campbell and Ferdinand, but for me, Terry and Carragher are the best two English central defenders at the moment. But what do I know about it? Corner to Milan, two minutes to go. Bop, he did! Stam has it on and then it's headed wide. It was Kaka on the far post as Stam headed it on. Kaka should have won the Champions League from Milan. Didn't, it's behind, it's a goal kick. Well, he just, when it came, it came very, very quickly, but if anything, he seemed to take his eye on it, off it, sorry. He just heads it back into the goal. Great, little Liverpool can do about it. Will this be the first European Cup final decided on a Thursday morning? Because that's where we're headed. You know, we kick off at this ridiculous time, quarter to ten at night, and if we have extra time, we will go into Thursday morning. Cece on the far side, Stam gets in, he knows his touch was last, it's a Liverpool throw-in. Does that mean we get paid twice because it's two days? Two days work, oh yeah, if you're paid at a daily rate, without question. Rees over the throw-in on the far side of the field, throws it back to Torori. We're inside the last minute of normal time, nobody wants to lose it here. Back it goes to Doudek, it's been a remarkable recovery by Liverpool. The fans didn't believe at halftime there was any way back, but the team has shown them there is a way back. They're in this final, Alonso, that's a good ball to Gerard. Gerard immediately tackled though by Serginia, and now it's back with Stam, and Stam lifts it towards the far side, towards Kaafu, one bounce, and is allowed to play, no, it's still in play. Kaafu keeps it, plays it back now to Katoosa, that was excellent from the resilient. And now Pirlo, inside the centre circle, hits it towards the left side, towards Serginio, too high, allowed to play for a Liverpool throw-in, and we've got ten seconds remaining before we hear from the fourth official how much time is left, but he just comes out, urges Switzer to come to him, he wants an instruction passed on to his players, Switzer does as he's told, a carrier waiting for the throw-in. Here's the fourth official, well no how much time will be added on for stoppages, just two minutes. Well that's a surprise in itself, throw-in taken, Gerard heads it on, and it's out of play, you'll never walk alone, reverberates around the Anatoerk Stadium in Istanbul. There were heads in scarves, heads in hands at half time, not believing. 3-3, remarkable. Maldini plays it upfield, Puffier heads it away, and Mann heads it further clear, and Carriger, right footed, knocks it into the half, the Milan half, Cece heads it on, Garcia chases after it, Stam, helped out by Nesta, puts it away to safety for AC Milan. Here's Serginio, Cece hustling him, finds Pirlo, Pirlo back to Katoosa, and now Stam, Stam on towards the halfway line, and Kaka just skips away from, come on, Kaka running, ominously towards the Liverpool penalty on his left foot, there's the cross, looking for Sjöpchenko, Carriger jumps, heads it clear, and Gerard sweeps it away to safety, and then Cece is fouled by Maldini, surely. Cynical foul as well, he knew. Well he didn't even give a free kick, didn't even give a free kick. Pirlo towards Serginio, Serginio slips it through the legs of Gerard, and Kalsus across, and Cully slips it away from Serginio, plays it to Gerard. We've got 40 seconds remaining of stoppage time, Liverpool on the counter attack here, it fizzles out as Garcia's pass, doesn't find Cece, here's Stam, one more attack left, and it might be a Milan attack, Caffo on the far side of the field, into the Liverpool half, tries to slip it in, it hits, and rebounds out of play for a throw in. At the moment, we're headed for extra time, unless there's a dramatic conclusion. After the throw in, Kaka back to Catozzo, on to Pirlo, Liverpool must be leaving for end of shoot, that's a great ball into Caffo, Caffo's header into the penalty area, hooked away, left foot on the volley by Hamal, there's the final whistle, and we will be playing until Thursday morning, it's 3-3. Well, let's just hope in extra time, Alan, that we have what's happened in the 92 previous minutes, absolutely brilliant, Liverpool really, dead and buried at half-time, made the changes, you think, so more in hope, rather than anything else, and they've been absolutely brilliant in the second half, taking the game to Milan, everything to play for. And at half-time, I thought, who's going to ring me tonight in 6-0-6? Who on earth will be bothered to call me? 0-500-99-6-9-3, it will follow the conclusion of this remarkable European Cup final, and I don't really care that I have to leave my hotel at 5am in the morning, keep me up all night, folks, 3-3, Mark. At half-time, Alan, you would be less a phone in more Samaritans, but what a turnaround, John Toshak also said before I added back to my kingdom that Liverpool needed a Lazarus-type comeback, well, he's up and off his bed and he's wearing a red shirt. I think so, and I think we can be forgiven for using the classic phrase that there's been a game of two halves, and I don't think that UEFA would have the heart to refuse Liverpool entry into Champions League next season should they pull it off. But as you said earlier, a couple of little things, Raph will be bitterly annoyed with himself, I'm sure, half-time. He's pulled Haman in there just to allow Shavi to go and be the playmaker, enjoy himself, something he can't do with Gerard. As Bob used to say, Bob Paisley, someone has to hang the latch in that midfield, and it's not Shavi, it was Haman. Push Risa further forward, went to three at the back against Caspian-Chevchenko, and of course we were going to look better that way, but we couldn't have believed in our wildest dreams that we would get three goals in six minutes and pull this round, and now, as I said earlier, I can't see Milan coming back. Well, all the noise is only coming from one end, Graham Taylor, and it's the Liverpool fans singing their well-known chorus, I said at half-time there were Liverpool fans with their heads in their hands, at full-time there were AC Milan fans with heads in their hands, but can we explain the second half purely on the fact that Liverpool have changed their shape? I think it goes a long, long way to explain it, but on the other hand as well, you still have to put belief into your players, whether you change your formation or not, you're three-nil down, you don't come back against an Italian side, particularly AC Milan, and you're three-nil down from three goals, but Liverpool have done it. Let's quickly go to Jonathan Lettjard. Jim from Southport, can you believe this? No, I can't, I think this is going to be the year for Liverpool to win the European Cup, the atmosphere is fantastic, and what a great goal by the Reds, what a comeback, absolutely fantastic. You're confident now, but what about half-time, when you were three-nil down, you were surely thinking I'm going to walk those steps, I'm going to go home now. If I'm perfectly honest, I nearly didn't come out, but I'm a true Red and I'm there to the end, come on, you Reds. I really had no concerns at all, I mean, oh, come on, don't give us that. Seriously, it's a game of two halves, and if they can score three goals in 45 minutes, then so could we, and of course we did it, so there we go, come on the Reds, we've got a final score. Final score, final score, a five-three for us, penalties. There you go, Mark. The last time a European Cup final had this many goals was 1962, Benfica beat Real Madrid, five-three in Amsterdam, but John, what about Milan's mental fortitude or otherwise? Well, I think Mark mentioned earlier, Mark Lawrence, that they've let Leeds slip just recently, and I think when we look at it, Milan were outstanding first half, and Liverpool were shocking, I mean, it was a combination of two things. The second half, Liverpool have been outstanding, and Milan have relaxed a little bit, they've lost a little bit of that discipline, Cac has gone too far forward, he hasn't gone in behind people, but I mean, psychologically, I mean, we're all here, we know it, we've been in football, if you've been three-nil in front, and you'll pull back to three-three, then all of a sudden, things are different. You can't turn that tap on hot and cold when you want it, you know, and as I said, it's been one of the great comebacks of all time, and none of us, as much as we hoped and we were sure that Liverpool would get a bit of pride back second half, they would perform better, we just could not have believed that this would have happened. The Milan fans have found their voice again, Mike, and the referees are going through that the pre-match rituals once more. Yes, Gerard and Maldini meet again on the halfway line to determine which way the sides will begin this first period of extra time. Looks like Maldini's actually won the toss, and so pleased that Gerard is back on his feet again, because he did seem to have a touch of cramp at the end of the 90 minutes, but they're going to start the extra time the way they began the game. So Liverpool in the second period of extra time will be attacking the end where they scored the goals, though in this first period they're going to be attacking the end where all their fans are. Well, they walk through the storm, held their heads high, and now have hope in their hearts. 3-3. But Milan, Mark, I thought actually closed the 90 minutes quite strong again. What did you think? Well, yeah, but as Benitez, he just takes his time and comes off the pitch as the referee waits for him. We talked about them being experienced, and we also talked about them being aged, and John Toshak said he can't just turn it on and off just like that. It'd be interesting to see how this will affect their raging players that this extra time is 30 minutes plus. And here we go. And the ball is over on the Liverpool right with their captain Gerard, long towards Ceasek, and Milan are there defensively once more through Maldini. And this was the way Milan started the game. And this was the way they played and scored their three goals. And there's still work for Liverpool to do now, as the influential Kaka finds Kafa with four Brazilians now in this Milan line-up. And they mustn't give this man too much space. Perlo, as we welcome back World Service to Istanbul, joining us on 5-Live. The first period of extra time is just underway here. There'll be no silver goals or golden goals. We've guaranteed 30 minutes, and it's Perlo once more, and Liverpool mustn't let Milan get back into the groove again, as Kaka takes possession, drills the ball into the area. Tollison has a little flick at it. Liverpool haven't cut it out yet near side the field. Now they have, but Milan have started extra time sharply here. One minute gone, and Japs Stam receives following the throw in from Kappu. Stam now into nest. All the Milan players are inside the Liverpool half. As Perlo has a go from 40 yards, hits the advertising board, and Dudek's got a goal kick. He didn't dip late enough to cause Dudek a problem. We've never seen it on the screen. What I thought was a chance for John Dalthompson. He seemed to come over, whoop his head, and he almost felt as though he didn't gamble. I think he could have probably done better with it. Two former Newcastle players now involved in this European Cup final. One either side, her man of Liverpool, Thomason the Dane of AC Milan. It's a goal kick now to be taken by Jetsy Dudek. Looking to Cise, Maldini will head it back to the half-way line. Liverpool trying to settle down at the start of this first period. They must remember how it was when they turned the screw and put Milan under pressure. And now here comes Hamann, tall and composed, flicked on by Luis Garcia. Smitzer, this is better from Liverpool. Their first attacking moves of the second half. Ball is played into Alonso. And now it's Smitzer trying to find Cise, headed away by Nesta. Ball on the edge of the Milan area. Hamann may win this back once more and finds Alonso. Liverpool pick up the possession short of a half-way line with Sammy Huppier. Huppier to Carago. Remember he picked up a yellow card, so he has to watch it now. As Huppier hits it long down the centre, tries to find Cise, away by Nesta. And Gattuso smooths it away from Milan. And it's now with Kappu down this near side of the field. A word from John Toschek. Yeah, who's interested in seeing Gerard and Smitzer swap positions there? I don't know whether they'll be struggling with something Gerard, but I mean that the Chaviolonso, Hamann, Gerard, the three in that midfield area where it all goes on has been one of the real reasons for Liverpool's success. Well, he's the dynamo, Mark, and they don't want Stephen Gerard at anything less than fully fit down there, do they? No, I think what's happened is they're worried slightly about Ciginho's come on obviously as a substitute late in the game. And I think Gerard will be in there to counter Ciginho rather than Smitzer doing that job. So you think it's not a fitness problem for him? Yes. Okay, in goes Thomason. And Thomason now trying to get away from the Liverpool, defend his Liverpool, mustn't concede moments like this. This is a free kick to AC Milan, dead centre, and Perlo's already delivered one goal from a free kick for Paolo Maldini. And now how many players will Milan commit forward here? But Shedchenko himself may decide to have a crack. And Perlo at the moment is the closest to the ball, but ominously for Liverpool, Shedchenko is just behind him. Ciginho's there too. Free kick to AC Milan, trying to reassert themselves in this extraordinary final. 3-0 they led at half-time, 3-3. Shedchenko is just stepping to one side, though he could know he's not going to take this one. Perlo is going to drive this ball in, the app-stam alongside him. Free kick to AC Milan, and that's awful in the end from Perlo. It's gone a long way back into the running track behind Dudex goal. Immediately he gets a replacement ball so the game can restart. That was a very relaxed run-up, wasn't it? And he's trying to hit across the ball right foot to make its work, but never ever started on the frame of the goal, and just kept going higher as it went over Dudex bar. So many times mark in finals, we see it getting very cagey, don't we, once it gets into extra time. This is what I think will happen here, to be quite honest with you. I really do, because you have to remember, obviously in the second half Liverpool had to really go for it. They've got themselves parity now, and I think they'll just be... They'll probe and probe away, but I don't think they'll really go for it. Long ball forward and Cece O's just gold! A flag took an age there as the ball was delivered by Risa. Cece looked as if he was going to be through, and then suddenly the flag went up, and now Liverpool have to filter back because Milan are crossing the half-way line. And the ball is with Perla, feeds to Ginho. Tomasin's in the area, Cece O too, the ball doesn't come in. I remember Benitez was saying yesterday that... Well, he reckons Liverpool haven't been practicing the penalties, but at the moment we're only 25 minutes away from that possibility of a penalty shootout. Maldini now, for AC Milan, got the show on the road with the opening goal. Poor ball in though, headed away by Hermann. Liverpool must get back in control of midfield here, with Hermann and Alonso. Gerard in a wider position now. It's with Cafu down the Milan right, Cafu faced by Risa. Into Catooso, Milan getting more possession at the start of the second half. Referees played an advantage because of a foul by Hermann, then Cafu's offside. Spanish referee giving Milan a good advantage there, and it's a free kick to Liverpool. Just as well, as well, he was offside, clever little ball by Perla. Just lifted it over, Risa. Maldini, 52 seconds, then two from Crespo, 3-0 at half-time. In the second half, Gerard with a header, Smeetser with a pile driver, and then a penalty, well, initially saved by Dita from Javi Alonso, but Alonso was there for the rebound, 3-3. And the ball out of play over on the far side for a Milan throw. Six minutes gone into this first period of extra time in Istanbul, and it's a much slower pace at the moment. And Milan are getting much more of the possession than they had in that second half. Yap, Stam for them, to Cafu, who's spending a lot of time at the moment inside the Liverpool half. Stam again looking to try and find Cafu, Liverpool on the defensive, and now Hermann is there, Hermann tries to pick out Cece, but only finds Perla. And now Kaka picks the ball up in the deep. Cegenio made a run on the outside, it comes back into central midfield once more, though. Milan at the moment just seemed to have the control here. As Cegenio nudges forward down that left hand side, great challenge coming in though from Steven Gerrard. That's the role that Mark Lawson was saying, that he thinks Benitez has given him to try and shadow Cegenio. Now, mistake by Perla, and Liverpool have a throw, deep inside their own heart. Yeah, and games just died a little bit, but as we say, I don't particularly think any team are really going to go for it, Mike. It's a case of... I mean, can you imagine the rollercoaster of emotions on behalf of both teams, and in the end, actually wears you out, not just physically, but mentally. For the last time they won this trophy, the two clubs, they both won in penalty shootouts. Milan against Juventus at Old Trafford, Liverpool, of course, in 84 against Roma. Here come Liverpool, though, now, but I don't think Garcia will reach that, and it's Maldini tidying up for Milan, back to Dida. Dida, who was the hero, of course, in the penalty shootout at Old Trafford against Juventus. Carragher, Liverpool being pressed back a little bit too much for their own liking here, as Milan try and go forward once more, but Triori, who's suddenly grown in confidence after a very jittery first half, but then Liverpool give the ball away too easily, mustn't do that, Milan have it, Perla to Gattuso near side of the field, they can still make one more change, can't they, Milan, if they want to in the game? The other thing as well, with Stevie Gera, he's almost playing as a right back, and Liverpool with Lise on the left have got the three centre-backs, they're almost gone to five at the moment and dropping quite deep. Maldini said that Liverpool's approach essentially is cautious, we know how to attack, he said before the game, well, Liverpool had to attack in the second half, and how they did it with those three goals, but just the moment the signs are not great for Liverpool, with Milan getting hold of the ball once more in midfield, and then fouling Hamam, and Liverpool just at the moment are not getting enough of it, it's a free kick to Liverpool, and they're taking plenty of time over this, and we're already well over halfway through the first period of extra time, and it's actually been a bit of a non-event so far, Mark. Well, we've said that, you know, say, Liverpool, Virtus.5 at the back, and it's hard work for the midfield players, and we're looking really to get sort of the likes of C-Sainte-Louis Garcia-3, but at the moment Liverpool can't quite get the ball, but Milan aren't hurting them. And now, Tomasin now. John Dal Tomasin, who like Crespo, has a fantastic goal-scoring record for his country, and in club football, and now Sejunio's going clear, Sejunio into the area towards Tomasin, who's given offside. Outcomes, Dudecki, he had the ball anyway, I think Tomasin knew that he was just offside, pulled out of the challenge on the goalkeeper, and it's a free kick. Not too dissimilar to a number of opportunities in the first half, where Milan almost got in in those positions. Lawrence and Graham Taylor, John Toshak with us here in Istanbul, where it's seven minutes to midnight. And the clearance eventually by Dudeck, Garcia gets up and finds Cece. Cece almost used his hand there to control that, he sets in from the far touch line, he's running into a bit of a blind alley, and in the end he's fouled Maldini as well, and it's going to be, I think the free kick's been given. Cece just looking to get a bit more involved here. Just slightly lightest, I haven't seen his hair. He looks like he's got a black scorpion tattooed or something. And there's like a black scorpion at the back of his head. Right, here comes Perlo, who's suddenly much more involved. And Kakas managed to find some room, too much space ready for Kakas. Tomasin in the area, great challenge coming in for Liverpool. Gerrard's there again defensively. Cece glances the ball back inside the Milan half, but doesn't find anyone in red. And Liverpool just sagging a little bit here, as the ball is lifted in by Cece. Tomasin misses out, five yards out, ball came onto him inside the six-yard area, only seemed to have to make contact, didn't get anywhere near it, but there's another warning sign for Liverpool. I'll tell you why I didn't score, Mike, because he didn't think that Thriory would miss it, and miss it really, he's never been anywhere near it, and in the end, he just took his eye off the ball, Tomasin, and Liverpool got away with it. Well, interestingly, now we're seeing Benitez again. We had Ancelotti out there in the second half. Benitez showing just a bit more concern, and Milan are just looking the stronger outfit at the moment. Here they come now, once more with the ever-dangerous European player of the year, Shevchenko, climbing the challenges. Kaffu drills the ball in, went a very long way, right across the six-yard area, might still be in play over on the far side of the field. Now it's just been carried out, and Gerard, that Liverpool are being pushed right back here, and there again is that big gap between Cease and the midfield. I think they're also sitting back, I think they are the architects of their own downfall, a little bit at the moment, which is, said to you, Stephen Gerard was virtually playing right back, Risa left, so they got five in there. You know, unless they're passing these absolutely inch-perfect to the front men, or the front man, the ball just keeps coming back at them. When they were able to keep the pressure on in the second half, Milan wobbled. But now Milan have just reasserted themselves, a stamp heads the ball away for them. Liverpool not getting enough possession, it's Cease now with a touch towards Luis Garcia. Too many white shirts there, and Gattuso steals the ball away from Liverpool once more. Gattuso, and it's fairly relentless at the moment, possession from Milan, three-three here an extra time, as the ball is played a long way from left to right, and Kaffu won't reach it, and John Toschak, how do you see it at the moment? Well, I think Liverpool, you know, Smica in particular and Garcia have got to get involved a little bit more. Liverpool have got the seven of them there now, with Alonso and Hamann in front of the three central defenders. Risa not forward so much, Gerard, but what Smica to me looks to be struggling, you know, and Garcia and Smica, they've got to take up better positions so they can get at the Italians a little bit, and take the pressure off Liverpool at the back. Because as Mark said, they're pushing back a little bit. The ball's coming back at Liverpool too many times here, and Gerard with a big long ball tried to find Sise, but he's smothered by Italian defenders, and there's nothing more that Benitez can do now. He can't make any more changes, and here come Milan, once more looking the fresher side, as Sugino wins the corner kick over on the far side. And these are anxious moments now for the Liverpool fans. Corner kick to Milan, and there's markings a little poor as well, as Perla received a short corner from Sugino. Perla brings the ball to the edge of the penalty area. Lots of options. Perla's ball in too near Dudeck, as Shevchenko came in at the far post. Nothing on though for Dudeck at the moment, there's no shape down there at all. Gerard's looking a little bit weary, and Dudeck still has the ball. No pressure on Perla whatsoever, probably more importantly. Smica, rare touch for him, and now Alonso to Hamann. That great effort that came from Liverpool to start the second half, but is it now starting to physically tell on them? Carragher to Steven Gerard, playing over on the right-hand side at the moment. Liverpool just slowing the game down, with a minute and a half to go of this first period of extra time on five-live and BBC World Service. I've got to say just at the moment, Milan are they likely a team to score the next goal? Liverpool might be Smica, I think, with a touch of cramp, and that's very sporting for Milan. They put the ball out of play so that he can receive attention. Just remind me when he came on. Just before half-time? Well, certainly well into the first half, wasn't it? 21 minutes green, he's saying to me. For Harry Q. Well, he's played a major part in getting Liverpool back into this game, with the second goal straight after Gerard had made it 3-1. Now he's off the pitch at the moment with cramp. That's what it's about. Smica receiving attention. Liverpool will have to throw the ball back to Milan here. With only 15 seconds of this first period of extra time, as Alonso gives the ball back and hits it all the way back to Dita in the Milan goal away to our left. Now Liverpool may be tiring, and they have to cope for the next few seconds. With only 10 men, and Perla orchestrating things now, once more inside the centre-circle. But Milan now just at walking pace. It's with Kaka, as Smica still struggles to get back on his feet again, over on the far side of the field. Milan try to take advantage, 3-3 here and at it's time. Really at the end of the first period now, that's a poor one from Gattuso to Kappu, as they look for permission to bring Smica back on again. We're going to play one more minute at the end of this first period of extra time. Liverpool seem to have shot the ball a bit here, Mark. Well, weather beneath, as I said, in the first period of extra time, just keep it nice and tight, let's see what Milan do, if anything. Maybe another master plan, go for it. Tomasson holds the ball up well for AC Milan. Most of this first period has been played inside the Liverpool half. Nice play from Kappu, it's a bit deep towards Shevchenko. Shevchenko's stretch, got the volley in, and Dudek was on the end of it. And that is the end of the first period of added time. It's been all AC Milan in this first period. There's a nice exchange there at the end between Shevchenko and Steven Jardin. They're getting the two players are embracing. So we are the moment heading for penalties. Alan? Well, I was just thinking, Mike, that at half time, in normal time, the best that Liverpool could hope for was respectability. Here at half time and extra time, it looks as if the best they can hope for is penalties. They've already surprised us once. Can they surprise us again, Mark? Well, you're not expecting me to say no, are you? Because the way that this game has gone, certainly, you would never, ever, ever know. I just hope they look a little bit at the moment, Alan, a little bit of a spent force. And unless, as we just said in comments, you've been here to this centre, but first half of extra time, take it easy, let's see what they do. Don't give the ball away, try and keep it, let's keep the shape, let's see exactly what Milan are going to throw at us. This is the start of the second half we chose. It's midnight. It's midnight. And we're not at the Oasis, are we? 0-500-909-693 is the number to call. I do believe that you're still awake, and a lot of you will want to call 0-606 at the conclusion of this final. Whatever the result now, whatever happens to the destination of this Champions League, the referee really needs to get them under way as quickly as possible. There shouldn't be any break in play at all. Anyway, Milan will kick off the second period of 15 minutes, attacking the end behind which the Liverpool fans are largely gathered. We're under way. We'll be counting down the minutes tonight, particularly for as long as it stays 3-3. Milan, 3-0 about half-time, at the end of 90 minutes it was 3-3, courtesy of three goals for Liverpool within six minutes between 54 minutes and 60 minutes. All the goals scored at the end that Liverpool are kicking towards. Well, we'll see. On the far side, Caifu, into Pirlo, who's certainly in a much more advanced position. The longer the game went on, here's Kaka, who's starting in dazzling form. Here's Cross, not good, headed away by Risa, CC largely in his own, but a good header back by Risa, and here Schmitzer appears to have recovered from that piece of crap. Alonso to Hamar, Hamar does brilliantly, holding off two Milan challenges, finds Alonso. On to Schmitzer, and back it goes to Liverpool defence. You did say piece of crap, didn't you? Whatever it is. Touch of crap. We'll all get crap here. Here's Schmitzer again to Gerard. Gerard's still operating on his right-hand side, like a right fullback. Schmitzer takes it up once more, slips it towards Kupea. Milan sitting back at the moment. We've got 13.5 minutes left for play in this remarkable final in Istanbul. Alonso, drifts it to the right side, and Gerard hits it upfield. Cece chases after it. Nesta getting across there first and just shivering the ball behind for a goal-kick. I think at some stage in this second half of exit time, Rui Costa will come on. And even if you're thinking ahead, to penalties for me. Oh, without question. A class act, the Portuguese. Cafu in the far side. Back to Pirlo. Catoosa screaming that he wants the ball, not been given it as yet. Pirlo instead finds Caca. Caca now with Maldini to his left, and Serginho. Caca feeding it through towards Serginho. It is at the final on so, who plays it upfield to Cece. Cece should run at Nesta now. Catoosa getting back to help out Nesta. Cece's got the ball, gets away from Catoosa, crosses, hoping for a corner and gets a corner. That's what he's so good at. He has such a threatening pace. Straight away, as soon as the ball was slid down to him, down the right-hand side, Catoosa's in there, trying to double mark on Nesta, and he's still got his team a corner. Talk about a frontman playing up there on his own, and getting something from you, from just a little bit of a nothing ball. I wonder how many people switched off their radios or television sets at half-time, thinking, can't bear any more of this. And then someone has now told them, by the way, we were playing extra time in Istanbul. Corner to Liverpool, from the right side, Smeets to deliver, plays it in low and weakly. Catoosa didn't control it well, Smeets is back in there, drives it back to Haman. Haman shoots, that takes a reflection on the Liverpool corner. Well, the delivery was poor from Smeets, and he's got away with it, because Haman's won himself. Gerritz and Julian's won. Yeah, absolutely. You get into the penalty area somewhere, you might do some good, but I'll take the corners as Steve and Gerritz, the Liverpool captain, from the right. How many red shirts are inside that penalty area? I count six, plus Haman lurking, and so too is Reesap. Now Gerritz sometimes flicks these back for Reesap. There it goes, though, it's deep, into the penalty area, hope he heads it down. That cleared, and there must be a foul challenge there. I think there was by Carragher, it's a free kick to AC Milan. That really is a good corner, because if he just peels off his man, goes towards, well, beyond the far post and dinks it back in, so it's a cheat foul. Nesta, flicks the free kick to Pirlo, and it comes towards the near side, and Serginia into Pirlo again, seeing far too much of the ball from my liking at Pirlo. On it goes, and Shifchenko spins away, red shirts converge on him, gets across into the water, Thomason, again, Traoré was stretched there, didn't know what he was doing, Traoré, Thomason, back to Caffo, and Caffo in field, taken on the chest by Coutusso. There was a little spell of Liverpool pressure there, now it's back with Milan. They have been dominated in extra time, we've got 11 minutes to go in the second period. Still Liverpool 3, AC Milan 3, Shifchenko, and it goes. Carragher looked hard there, the pass back by Thomason, doesn't meet Shifchenko, and her man brings it away for Liverpool. On to Cece, Cece turns, he's got past one defender, he's got Garcia to his left, still has the ball, oh Cece wastes that possession. In the end Schützer, about 30 yards from goal, and it bumbles through to the goalkeeper. I just can't believe he never saw Garcia, because he started to run the same way, you must see in your eye line a red shirt run across you. Can't believe he didn't see him, Pirlo, oh good ball to the left side, towards Saginio, who brings it down brilliantly, into the penalty, it goes, and it was deflected away by Carragher, could have gone anywhere, could have gone into his own net, it's cleared, and Carragher's been hurt there. Carragher is injured at the moment, Risa hits the ball upfield, Carragher's down inside his penalty area, and Risa just clatters it into the Milan half, and out of play. I think, you know what, he's got cramp right at the very, very top of his leg. It's not a groin injury, that is... Carragher, I've just read his lips, he just screamed cramp. John Toschak, 10 yards to my left, John can you bear this? Oh, I tell you, I'm not sure there's Cece in our day with Schenck, and Bobby's been putting Walton for a month for not seeing Garcia there. The only thing really, Cece, Garcia, and Schmitz, I mean, it's easy for him up here, we're not tired, but the three of them look to be following the ball, you know, and the defence starts up front, and that part of it, these three, are not doing it as well, I'm sure as Rafa would like, being such a disciplinary man it is. But what a chance they are there on the counter-attack, Cece and Garcia. Well, Carragher is hurting, and here comes Rui Costa. The other thing, Alan, Carragher's just gesticulated to Gerard, he's going sitting there for me for a minute, I've got to go off anyway, as is the rules, but he's still not sure, and he's better off in this wide position, just in case the ball gets played through the centre, where Gerard can use his pace. I think Milan's sent an opportunity here. Rui Costa's replaced Gattuso, and not only is he brilliant at taking penalty kicks for Rui Costa, he is another substantial attacking threat. Carragher's off the pitch, no, he's back on now. Play continues, obviously we'll have at least a bit of a stoppage time at the end of this game. Now, ball played in by Cegino and Carragher again, stretching, and that must have hurt once more, but he gets it behind, it's a corner. He's done well. Not even in the pinnacle, have all the places where it comes. Eight minutes left in extra time, 3-3, corner to Milan, Rui Costa flicks it in deep, and Duda came, didn't get a touch in the ball, and Garcia cleverly let it just drift over his head behind for a goal kick. Well, under no pressure whatsoever, I think he's trying to say to the defenders, don't worry boys, I knew it was going long, I was never going to try and touch it, he didn't know. It still might not come to this, but Duda, you know, two years ago, he came off his line so often, but he wrote his luck, and he was the man who made sure that Milan beat Juventus at Old Trafford. Duda looks a little bit hesitant up in recent minutes, but it's still 3-3, the ball's now with Gerard, and Gerard inside the centre circle, back to Duda. Duda now, out to the edge of the box, he's got seven and a half minutes to go, plus stoppage time. Duda hits it towards the right side, headed away by Maldini, away from little Garcia. Here's Alonso, good turn by Alonso, and then he was fouled there by Sarginio, it's a free kick to Liverpool. Well, he was under pressure for a little moment as well, thought maybe Sarginio would nick the ball often. Free kick to Liverpool, a yard or so inside the Milan half, towards this near touchline, the Liverpool right. And he's, hope he's going forward, no he's not, nor Caragher, nor Treore. It looks as if it's going to be aimed at Cece, it is. Cece jumps, heads it on to the penalty area, but to no good effect, it's back to Dida. Well, not only that, it was a high ball, so he's going to have to generate any kind of pace, and Garcia hadn't even gambled in case he flicked it on. Milan don't want the lottery of penalties, that's obvious, they want to win it here in extra time with a fourth goal. They've got possession on the far side of the field. Right, Liverpool have left everybody back, Bar Cece, and Milan's white move towards the Liverpool penalty area. Sarginio flicks it in, that looked like a foul on Hoopia, not given. And then Garcia caught in possession, very careless indeed by Garcia. Taken up now by Pirlo, the dangerous Pirlo, down the left flank for Milan, and he gets beyond Gerard. Pirlo still running, and that was an obstruction by Hamar, and I think Pirlo ran into the German. Definitely, I mean, it is really, really clever play by Pirlo. He just nudged it to a side, and made sure he ran into Hamar, and the referee had to give the foul. Great play initially, mind. No question about it, but Hamar made sure he also made contact with Pirlo. Now, this is a free kick in a very promising area for Pirlo. Yes, the angle is acute, there are only two men inside the Liverpool wall, but Pirlo can whip this in towards the far post. Dudek Biver played in, took an affliction, that's gone behind for a corner. Yeah, Luis Garcia I think just got something on it, and took it high, and arched over the far post to Liverpool. So last time I'm going to tell you, 0599, 693, the number to call for 606, which will follow sometime. Corner to Milan, five minutes of extra time remaining, 3-3, swung in after a great corner, well defended too by Liverpool, it was Carragher ahead of the way. Milan have it back again on the far side of the field, and another cross whipped in, whoopie a heads it down, and this time alone so carefully, side-footed the pass to the right. Oh, Schmitzer looks very tired, he still has the ball though, up towards the halfway line, and then it was he bolt, surely? No, he played for a foul, and if he didn't give it. Oh, well Schmitzer looks absolutely out his feet, most of the Liverpool team look out in their feet. Geron, just about gets in a challenge there, finds Hamar, Schmitzer, to Garcia, Garcia back to Hamar, and swept on towards the far side. My goodness, do you know something? I'm not saying that they're getting the decisions wrong, but both linesmen take half an hour to raise their flag, offside against Caesar. Do you know what seems to happen? It's almost as they decide when the ball comes to them rather than when it's kicked. It's unbelievable. Very, very slow. The ball is with Pirlo, and Pirlo finds Rue Costa, Rue Costa slips it towards Jeff Cienco, who's filing Heopia, Heopia still managed to clear it, referee saw that one. Now Garcia from Alonso's par on towards Caesar, not the best of balls, Caesar got no chance of that, headed clear by Nesta. Milan come forward again, four minutes left for play. Caffu over the halfway line, and it goes, and drifted towards the left side, towards Zerginia. Geron rises well, heads it infield to Alonso, and Alonso, Cooley plays it towards Schmitzer, but Schmitzer didn't make enough effort to get to the ball. Pirlo has it from Milan to Zerginia, Benitez streaming instruction. Zerginia takes on Geron, dives in and gets to the ball, and clears it towards the halfway line, and that comes off Maldini, who gets, oh that's ridiculous, Maldini gets the throw in. That had to be a Liverpool throw in. How it took, Tom? Dear, oh dear. No wonder Benitez is frustrated. Stam on the halfway line after Milan take the thrown that shouldn't have been theirs. All the fans are anxious now. Nobody wants to lose with this time remaining, just three minutes of extra time. Three, three, ball played in, and a nice save by Gudek, another brilliant save by Gudek. How did he keep that out? Astonishing. Chef Tchenco could have scored twice. The second save is the one, I mean the first is good enough from the header, great. The second save is unbelievable, all right you might claim it hit him, he kept it out, magnificent. Milan thought they'd won it. I thought they'd won it. Unbelievable from the Polish goalkeeper. I think Kaka would up there to say well done. Corner to AC Milan, there it goes, carrying her heads it away. Liverpool hanging on for penalties, Ceasey heads it on, a man might win it but he hasn't got the pace to get after. Oh I think that's a foul by Diddy Heman, free kick to AC Milan, taken quickly by Kafeu to the far side. A Nazi to play for a throw in. I can't get over that save. I can't, just astounding. The other thing as well, a couple of times when the balls come in he's completely bummed them out. Do you remember that Jim and Gumbay double saving the cup final? That was better. Here's Pirlo, Pirlo midway inside the Liverpool half, all those Kaka, Kaka's pass wasn't good. Garcia gets it to Heman, Garcia was down there with a bit of cramp as well. Ceasey gets it back, Ricci looks dreadfully tired and just lifts it over the half way line, two minutes to go. Liverpool are completely dead on the feet. Completely dead on the feet. Throw in by Stan, Pirlo. Milan just seemed to have extra legs now. Can they find a fourth goal? It's Pirlo again to the right side and Kafeu, Kafeu right into the penalty area, drops it back, a long-sought chest at nine. Very confidently finds Heman, Heman on to Ceasey and Ceasey was definitely pushed over by Stan, that's a free kick. No doubt about it, even if he complains he got the ball Stan, it's tackle from behind. And Liverpool will be much relieved to get that free kick. Welcome, breather. Don't rush about taking it, Liverpool. I don't think they've got the legs anymore, I just don't think they've got the legs. They've got to find a drive for the penalty kicks. If we get to penalties, Gerrard hits it crossfield, but that's between Ceasey and Garcia and Russia's out of play, one minute to go. Just keep your belief here, keep your shape, stand up, don't let anybody go past any Milan players and be first to the ball and be aware of where everybody is when the ball gets delivered in the box. Whatever happens now, Liverpool embarrassing in the first half can leave a stumble with pride. Will they leave it with the Champions League trophy? Cupja heads it away from the edge of his own penalty here. Maldini climbs all over Garcia but fairly and heads it back to Nesta. Nesta now, to Maldini. Maldini who opened the scoring, remember, after 52 seconds. In now to Pirlo. Pirlo on towards the far side and easily won back by Hamann. Hamann's done brilliantly since he came off. Hamann over the halfway line despite him being fouled. Suddenly it's three against three here for Liverpool. Hamann still going. Hamann finally runs into Stam, who clatters the ball over the halfway line. We've got one minute of stoppage time at the end of this extra time. Here's Cece, right of the Milan penalty here. Gets it back to Schmitzer. Surely Liverpool can't win it from this day. Schmitzer goes down, Liverpool have a free kick. Well, two things. A, advantageous position and secondly you can just take your time, run the clock down, but make sure that you make DiDa make a save from this. Well, Mike knows what it was like six years ago. He knows what it was like in Barcelona. Into stoppage time. Manchester United still a goal down and yet they scored twice and they won the Champions League. Now here we have a situation when we've got 20 seconds remaining of stoppage time in extra time. It's 3-3. Liverpool with a free kick about 25 yards out. This is going to be struck by Gerard. I think it's into Hamann. Into Hamann, back to Gerard. It takes the wall out of play. Liverpool wait because the referee waits. Gonzales now steps away. He thinks Milan's defence is 10 yards away from the ball. I can't believe this. We've had our minute of stoppage time. This will be the last significant action. DiDa for Gerard. No, it's back to Risa. Risa's shot blocked and there's the final whistle. That was the last action. My word. That is a really clever free kick because I think it had everybody guessing what they're going to do. We guessed completely wrongly. Slips into Alonso as well. Well, this is Citi of Pants time now. If you're the manager, if you're Benitez, you go brilliant. You've won the game as far as I'm concerned. Whatever happens in the penalties, go and take them with confidence. Just take the pressure off them. Take the pressure off them. Well, will it have mattered whether or not Liverpool have practised penalties? I still think it's down to psychology here. It's who really believes will win. At the end of extra time, Liverpool 3, AC Milan 3. Thank you very much indeed, Alon. John Toschek, they're absolutely gone, aren't they, Liverpool? This is realistically the only way they were going to win from at least half-time in that extra time, penalties. Yeah, that's it. I feel as though I've been watching one of those Mohammed Ali-Jo Fraser fights, you know. 15 rounds right to the death. Penalty kicks are always... tend to look at the goalkeepers as well. As much as the keepers and must admit, the Milan keeper looks an awesome sight, but there we are. Fantastic achievement from Liverpool, and now we'll see who really wants to take the penalty kicks. There's so much at stake. Winner takes all, nothing for the losers. Jamie Carragher is practically manhandling Jersey Dudeck, isn't he there? He tried to rev him up, and now Harry Kuhl has come to have a word. We think the penalties are going to be to our right, which would be in front of the AC Milan fans. If this is Dudeck's last ten minutes in a Liverpool shudder, Rafa Benitez seems to be writing down the penalty takers. Is there some way to bow out, Graham Taylor? Well, looking at Benitez there, he seems to be going round with his notebook to certain players and saying, OK, now, whether they decided before and he's just checking out, are you still OK for the penalty, et cetera, I don't know. But just seeing a little bit earlier, Carragher talking to Dudeck, I believe knowing what I do know of Jamie Carragher, he's probably saying to him, look, stand up as long as you can, because that, for me, you could either do it one or two ways. You can choose, and does it go your way, or stand big and don't move, because you'll always get one penalty that doesn't go into the corner, and you probably only need to make the one save. And it seemed to me that he was really talking about that. John, does it matter that Liverpool have looked so tired in the sense, you know, this will take quite a lot out of you mentally, and if you're very heavy-legged, dead man walking as you're coming up to the spot, will that make an impact on the Liverpool players? I think that Liverpool, if you said that at halftime, you know, which one would you be happy to take a penalty kick? I think 11 of them would have put their hands up. Now, I'm not so sure, but as I say, it's a fantastic achievement. I think they'll just be absolutely delighted, you know, the fact that they've reached these stages, and they think, hey, we can't have put what we put into this second half an extra time now to miss out on penalty kicks. Don't tell me that, for goodness' sake. So I've got the goal with Liverpool. Who knows on your penalties? You cannot. I mean, what we're all saying before it could go to penalties, but we're all saying it could go to penalties off a 0-0. I mean, what do we know about it? That's the thing, and it's really been fantastic. Very 0-dead and out, back to 3-3. 30 minutes extra time on your back foot. You're into your penalties now. Be brave, be strong, get some pace on them, and you've done all that you can for us. One of these clubs is going to win the European Cup twice in a row, and penalties one's going to have won it on penalties, and then lost it on penalties. Vassos Alexander, the party was somber at halftime. What's it like now in Liverpool? Unbelievable. Everyone's singing, you'll never walk alone, but they're tense, the tension got wrenching. Everybody here at the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool thought that Liverpool were going to score from that free kick right at the end of extra time. Suddenly the final whistle went, heads went into hands. The realisation that it's penalties, and there's nothing we can do here to influence the result from Liverpool, but we're trying. We're singing, you'll never walk alone in the atmosphere. Fantastic again. John, in the penalty shootout at Old Trafford that Alan and Mike described, Dita came racing off his line for a couple of them. There was one famous photograph in the paper the next day. He must have been four or five foot off his line, at least. Do you hope that the referee will keep a good eye on that? Well, you don't see referees these days. I don't know, over the last few years, they seem to have abandoned that now with penalties, particularly in situations like this. I think they just say, right, every man for himself now, do what you can. Yeah, I think that's wrong. You can't go away that you can make sure that the goalkeepers stay. You're now going to have a number of penalties, and you can actually enforce that. I think what referees should say to the goalkeepers to start with, listen, you stay on your line and let them know. Nice touch between the goalkeepers to Dita. Just shaking hands. Well, we had the penalty shootout on Saturday at the FA Cup final, the first cup final to go to Spock Kicks. This will be even more important, though, and even more dramatic. Time for the penalty shootout to start, then. Mike Ingram to do the first penalty. Well, Mark Lawrence, who, of course, was involved in the penalty shootout, reminds me that the penalties were taken in front of the Roma fans. They're going to be taken at the end where all the Milan fans are. Seginio, who was one of the players who missed the penalty at Old Trappard, the Brazilian, and a little bit of gamesmanship from Jersey Dude. Remember the fun and games with Bruce Grobilar, of course, in 1984? So, it's getting to me easy for you to say, well, it's Thursday morning. It's 22 minutes past midnight. And Seginio will take the first penalty for AC Milan. Dude's doing his Grobilar impersonations in the goal away to our right. Milan looking to get off to a great start. All their players on the sideline. Oh, the ball from Seginio. It's gone a long way back. All the Milan players, squad players, linking arms down there. But what a great start from Liverpool's point of view. Now, can they capitalise on it? Well, he just laid back. You can see when he was coming up to strike it, Dude dancing on the line. He just never went anywhere near the goal. Didi Haman will take the first of Liverpool's penalties. I'm wondering when Gerard's going to come into this. Gerard, having missed against Tottenham, said he'd never taken another penalty again for Liverpool. So, Haman has the first responsibility. And this is to get Liverpool the edge in this penalty shootout. Seginio has already missed. Haman with quite a long run-up. He's going to hit it right footed. Then he slows down and he slips it into the net, past Dina's right hand, and Liverpool are in front. Top penalty. Absolute top penalty. Right footed in step, right in the corner of the goal. Di Danio chance. Well, the Milan coach, Ancelotti, revealed yesterday that his team have been practising the penalties. And here is, you would imagine, possibly one of their best penalty takers, because it's the dead ball specialist, Andrea Perlow, whose free kick set up the goal for Maldives. And then Dudeck says, here's the ball, son. And, well, you know, it's gamesmanship, but this is tense stuff. And Liverpool just have the slenderest advantages, as Dudeck weighs both arms at Perlow. Perlow moves in and Dudeck spreads himself to the right and makes a save. Perlow didn't really strike it with any conviction. And Cise will step up now to try and put Liverpool 2-0 ahead. Dudeck is dancing on the line. It was a poor penalty. Dudeck gets right, and as I say, very, very savable height. This penalty cannot win it for Liverpool. But you think back to Blackburn in October. Cise, a double break of his leg. He might never have played again. Liverpool will give Liverpool such an advantage if Cise can score from this one. It would put them 2-0 up, and the penalty shoot out. Cise, a long, long run-up. Here he comes. Dede moves, moves the wrong way. Cise makes it 2-0 to Liverpool. Opposite side to Haaman, just as Culey taking a penalty as you like. I think the secret there was he just made his mind up as he went to strike it. Never worried about the goalkeeper, and he was always going to put it in the same place. Who says they haven't been practicing? Now then, John Dalthomason, I think Kenny Dalglish signed him for Newcastle. Liverpool legend, of course. And Tomason now really has to score for Milan, because they are 2-0 down in the penalty shootout, having missed both their previous penalties. This one's right down the centre, given Milan a foothold back in the penalty shootout. Liverpool 2-1 lead. I think a bit like Cise for Liverpool. John Dalthomason just ignored the goalkeeper, and decided where he was going to stick it, and in the end it was a comfortable penalty. John Orrisa has scored eight times this season, and boy, when he hits them, he really hits them. Does he try to place it? Does he try to blast it? Does he really succeed for Liverpool? This would give them a two-goal advantage, with only two Milan penalties to go. They're so close now, so very, very close. John Orrisa being very careful how he places the ball. He won't take it right footed, I guarantee you that. It's his left foot that will drive this ball, hopefully into the net, and it's saved! It's saved by Dieter, diving to his right. He pushed it around the post, so Milan are back in it. Unusual for Orrisa in terms of striking a ball. He normally strikes it so hard and so acute, but it's a very, very good save by Dieter. Lo, he almost clipped the post. Excellent save. Well now, Caca, the young Brazilian, who laid on the two goals for Crespo, can actually level things off here now for Milan, though Liverpool, of course, would still have a penalty in hand. But it's 2-1 now to Liverpool in the penalty shootout, but Caca has to put this one away. He really does. Otherwise, Liverpool can march on here, and the Liverpool fans now doing their very best to put off Caca. Caca's going to run at this one from about 10 yards out, and here he comes, Caca! Beautifully taken. It is now 2-2, and the pressure is now back on Liverpool. I see things there, the old Bruce Grobler Wobby legs, I think, and no influence whatsoever on another good tip. Well taken penalty by Caca and Milan. Vladimir Shriezer had crump, serious crump during extra time. Well, don't think about it now, Vlad. Just place that ball on the spot and plant it into the net. This to give Liverpool a 3-2 advantage with just one penalty each to come, guaranteed. Shriezer, a long, long run-up. Here he comes, and he slipped into the net. Dina went to the right. Shriezer's penalty went to the goalkeeper's left. Liverpool lead 3-2. Of course, we know he'd already scored in the game, and a very well taken one it was as well, Alan. And again, all about confidence, all about making your mind up. Never worry about the goalkeeper. Very, very good penalty. Well, could this be Roma revisited? The problem for Liverpool is that the greatest striker in Europe at the moment, Andre Shevchenko, the European footballer of the year, the man whose decisive penalty won the European Cup at Old Trafford against Juventus two years ago. He wants the ball immediately. His body language looks all right. He wants to get on with it, but of course, if he misses here, Liverpool against all the odds have won the Champions League. Shevchenko, who that saves! For Liverpool! And against all the odds, the team who were 3-0 down at half-time, Liverpool have won the Champions League. Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart. This is amazing. A night they will never forget. Liverpool are champions of Europe. And Stephen Gerrard never had to take the penalty. He was bound to take the next one. Can you believe it? I gave the European Cup to Milan before half-time. It was inconceivable that they wouldn't win from a position in which there were three goals up, but Liverpool were an astonishing recovery. Three goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half. Benitez had changed the tactics, changed the way they attacked, and they went for it. And the most unlikely of heroes, Jürtzi Dudek, who may well never play for Liverpool again. Reina, it seems, is on his way from Spain to take over the number one spot. Dudek has won the European Cup. Mark, don't forget as well, Alan. The double save he made from Shevchenko in the very, very last minute of the game. The first save of the double save was excellent. The second save was magnificent, and he saved two out of the five penalties, including one, of course, as well, that Milan missed. But irony of all ironies, the man who's been known for one or two fatal mistakes at Liverpool was absolutely brilliant in the Liverpool goal. I've got to borrow the words from the great, the very great Peter Jones. I don't believe it. I swear, I don't believe it. Liverpool are European champions for the fifth time, and do you know what else this victory means? England have now won more European trophies than any other European nation. Liverpool have won more European cups than all the other English clubs put together, magnificent from Liverpool. Let's go straight to some of the fans with Jonathan Ledger. June from Southport, you've got a spot on your in-tears. Can you believe it? No, it's an incredible night. We've conquered Europe again, and the mighty Reds are back. I can't explain. It's just unbelievable. Fantastic, Phil. You had no doubt at all. You said five, three, we had two in penalties, and you didn't even eat in Steven Gerrida the end. Can you believe it? Well, I really can't believe that Stevie didn't need to score a goal, but I really cannot believe the atmosphere that resulted this game. The fans, tens and tens of thousands of them here are slightly wrong on the final result in terms of the score, but a magnificent victory for all of the Merseyside, all of the United Kingdom, Great Britain, and everyone who supports English football. Fantastic. You've got a friend here. What's your name? I'm Peter Harris from Bristol. I knew we were against the odds. We didn't come here as favourites, but if it went to penalties, just like Arsenal, it was going to be even, and we were going to win on penalties, and I'm sure Benizas trained everybody on penalties before we came. It's been a fantastic night. How does this night compare, Jim, to some of the others? Surely you were there in 77, 78, one of the others? I was there for the Bruins game when King Kenny scored that goal, but tonight's very, very special. Well, I was at the 77 game. I was privileged to be there at that game, and dare I say it, this actually beats it by a mile. Why? Because the atmosphere, the stadium is phenomenal. The atmosphere is amazing. We went there as favourites. We came here as the underdog, and we just really tamed this Italian team. Superbly well. We're going home tomorrow. I can't believe you'll be here for a week. Very sadly we have to go home tomorrow. Thanks for your time. One last word. Sorry, Jose Mourinho. Max Morris, eat your house! We were here! Thank you very much, Jonathan Maldini, who knows the fair thing or two about losing on penalties who's in Italy, who's completely distraught. The joy of sport is this utter unpredictability, and we have seen it all. Well, I mean, we've witnessed one of the great comebacks of all time in European football, and summarising it very quickly, Liverpool in the first half were shocking by their own admission, I'm sure. Then the second half, Salvid, the idea must have been to Salvid some pride, but we could never have believed three goals in six minutes. We pulled back to 3-3, and then, amazingly, the man who's missed the penalty for Milano, Chef Cienpo, the one player that we thought who could have been the one who decided the defensive type of game has been the unfortunate one to miss a penalty. Milano be kicking themselves. I mean, I don't care who you are, or whatever fightback you put up with a side of their quality should never be 3-0 in front in the Champions League final, throw it away. But Liverpool, they changed things around, they were absolutely magnificent. They scored one, and they grew in confidence, they scored two, and they grew in confidence, and when they scored the third, we say, come on, we just couldn't see them losing. Fantastic achievement. But Hang on, is what they had to do an extra time? Well, they did, an extra time, I mean, they were out on their feet. A lot of tired legs, obviously. You know, and Milan pushed forward and pushed forward. Terrific save from Doudet, right at the death there. Double save, fantastic. But as we've said earlier, really, you have to wrap up, wrap up in it, I know him very well, he will be at half-time, absolutely desolate with what he'd done, you know, and then second half, everything's gone right for him. He would have been a desolate grim tear at half-time, as we've just seen a shot of Carlo Ancelotti at the moment. You must wonder what on earth has happened here. Well, you'll not be able to. I mean, you put the boot on the other foot, you're 3-0 up at half-time, you know you've got to go out there. But I mean, just looking at his face there, he'll just not understand what has happened. And I've got to be honest, we've watched it and it's hard for us to understand. How did that happen? And certainly, you know, they come out the second half. The tactical changes made all the difference. And it's a great, really, respect to Benitez, that he was prepared to make those changes. He didn't get it right at the start of the game, made the changes and the players then come on and deliver the goods for him. And that's the fate of ASOS in Liverpool before we have the presentation. Absolute, absolute bedlam here at the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool. In fact, bedlam doesn't do the word justice. When that last penalty was saved, everyone was kissing everyone. They just couldn't believe that Liverpool are the champions of Europe. People are looking at me when I say that. And they can hardly believe that Liverpool, the champions of Europe, the way it happened, three goals down and that was a morgue here at halftime. Those three goals were in half, the people had left, they came back in. The penalties went all Liverpool's way. A very fat man with a beard gave me a snog when that last penalty was saved. Now, tell you what, I didn't care at all. What an atmosphere here in Liverpool. I feel privileged to have been here, let alone Istanbul. Well, the Milan players are just going to their fans now and applauding them. The Liverpool players have been in a knock, they've been applauding them for this extraordinary turnaround. The European Cup is on its plinth and here's Alan Green with the presentation. Honestly, I do feel sorry for Milan. I thought for 45 minutes it was a remarkable performance. But they're totally dejected now. Maldini, it is seventh European Cup final. We thought when he scored, no doubt, after just 52 seconds, that he was leading his team to victory again in the best possible way. Leads his weary foot soldiers towards the podium. Most of them already have winners medals. Most of them couldn't care less about being runners-up. But they'll have to go through with the formalities. They will have to step forward, get up there and get their medals from Leonard Johansson. And that European Champions Trophy, that so many of the Milan players touched as they walked out on the pitch. So many of them did. I watched very carefully to see if Liverpool players did it at all. No, they didn't. They knew there was a task to get on with. Milan must have thought they were going to win tonight and it will take them a very, very long time to believe that they've lost. Meantime, to their right, Liverpool players, many without their shirts now. They can't believe it either. Not from 3-0 down. It just doesn't happen. This was an astonishing victory. A banner I read now, Liverpool FC, with five European Cups, ambitiously emblazoned on it. The European Cup is coming home, it says. And boy, is it coming home. And Rafa Benitez, what a first season he's had. Yes, we know about the disappointments in the Premier League. The terrible record away from home. But boy, does he know how to set up a team in the Champions League. Maybe not at the start of tonight's game. But certainly by half-time, he turned it around, he got it right. And now he succeeds Jose Mourinho, who last season, remember, won the Champions League with Porto, having won the UEFA Cup the previous season. Well, last season for Rafa Benitez, it was Valencia in the European Cup. Now it's Liverpool in the Cup that matters. The biggest club competition in the world. And what I wonder is going through the mind of Stephen Gerrard at the moment. Of course, it's the greatest night of his playing life. The greatest night of his life as a footballer. Did he go into this game thinking, should I leave Liverpool? Should I go somewhere else? I don't know. What is he thinking now? Rafa Benitez, I think, is crying. I think he's crying. This most impassive of individuals, I'm not talking about his body language in the technical area, but it's the way he takes reverses in his stride. He didn't mow in the season about injuries or players breaking legs. He just got on with a job. And what a climax here. What a climax in Istanbul. Where are those Milan players? They're still being held up, but Maldini has moved forward onto the stage. And brave, Paula Maldini. Just one European Cup final now behind the all-time record, held by Hento of Real Madrid. And as John Toschak was saying, how remarkable, that he made his appearance in his first European Cup final in 1989 and 16 years on, he's still there. And his contract goes on to 2007. He might yet get another opportunity. All those players moving, taking their medals and trying to seem just respectful of Liverpool's time, but the truth is, six years ago, I looked at the dejected Munich bodies. The Bayern players lying on their backs in the new Cup, and I wondered what had hit them. Well, Manchester hit them that night. And tonight, Milan has been hit by Liverpool. Liverpool players just dancing around. Well, how many are right there? All wearing Liverpool shirts or prepared T-shirts. Prepared T-shirts. Champions League winners. 2005. Well, already Pirlo, I see, having had the medal draped around his neck, has taken it off in disgust. Schiffchenkel is flat out on his back. It's no disgrace to miss a penalty, but he will never forget missing the penalty that lost the European Cup final. What a save by Dudek. What a save by Dudek. Gerrard now looks to the Liverpool end of the ground. I said the Liverpool end of the ground, but from our perspective, it appears the Liverpool fans have occupied two-thirds of this stadium at the very least. The referees and his assistants and the fourth official, they all get their mementos, and then will wait. Liverpool players still embracing. I've never seen Gerrard look like this, except on two previous occasions, one when he scored that goal against Olympiacos, and the next when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the semi-final second leg. The Milan end is deserted. They're not staying behind to applaud Liverpool, which is a great shame, a great, great shame. And now the UEFA officials are anxious to get the Liverpool players up on the podium. Juventus, Chelsea, Milan. They're the three teams that Liverpool beat from the quarter-final stage. To win the European Cup. Sean Onarisha with a ridiculous hat on his head. Gets his medal. And from there, you're having a huge smile from there. Where did you get that silly hat, John? And he kisses the trophy. And Jamie Carragher. Jamie Carragher just walked past it, just thankfully. Carragher, Liverpool's player of the season. The most improved player of the season, arguably, in the whole of English football. Sammy Hoopje, who suddenly became a second-choice central defender, when Pellegrino arrived at the club. But he's kept his place, of course, in the Champions League competition. Dudeck, while he's now got the T-shirt on, he will remember this moment for the whole of his life. All the players, Traore, slip in the first minute. It's forgiven now, son. Cece is up there. He scored a penalty. His comeback, not tonight, but over the season, incredible. He really believes he might never play again. And now, what a dance from Gimbrel Cece. He's embracing that. Don't get too close, son. You might get arrested for that sort of indecent display. Cece finally leaves the European Cup in his own. And I'm waiting. And I'm looking for Stephen Gerrard. He's the last one up there. Aditmar Hamad, who came on at half-time and helped transform the Liverpool display. Javi Alonso is next. And there's only one player more. And this player, Askaise, from Merseyside, was three years of age when Liverpool last won the European Cup. It's the dream of his life to be captain of a European Cup-winning team for Liverpool. He kisses his medal. He moves towards this trophy, inches towards it. Dudek is indicating with his hands that Stevie must be nervous. Rafa Benitez gets his medal. Gerard can't wait to turn around, face that trophy again, and wait for the re-uruption of noise. A kiss from Gerard to the European Cup. Surely now, he cannot think of leaving Liverpool Football Club. That decision is yet to be made, but I'll tell you what, there will be some party tonight in Istanbul. Now, Leonard Johansson lifts the trophy, shows it to the Liverpool players. Gerard says, that's mine. And at a quarter to one this Thursday morning in Istanbul, Liverpool are champions of Europe. In 2005, a remarkable game, a remarkable recovery, and a remarkable triumph. Five times winners, Liverpool FC. That's Alan Green. Let's get the initial thoughts of our Chief Football Correspondent, Mike Ingham. Mike, there's a half-time sheet here behind me, which is a bit of detritus from left from earlier. AC Milan 3, Liverpool 0, it says there. Well, that says it all, doesn't it, about the magnitude of Liverpool's comeback. Well, I think it's worth keeping that sheet of paper. I think that might be a collector's item in years to come. First of all, generally speaking, Mark, I think we've all been privileged to see one of the great European finals. I know it pitted out to be an extra time, but this was the 50th European Cup final. And, you know, I remember as a child, the great gaming in Glasgow, Eintracht, Frankfurt and Real Madrid. This was special tonight, OK? So let's get that on the record, first of all. Liverpool had to qualify for this tournament, and we're losing 1-0 at home to Graz of Austria in one of those games as well. It says a lot about the strength of the Premier League, that they finished fifth and they're champions of Europe. They must defend the trophy next season now. John Toschak was making the point, particularly the way they achieved it tonight. Mention now, I think, Manchester City will probably be in Europe in the UEFA Cup. That's an issue. All the way through this season, though, this script seemed to be heading towards something like this. I hope that the likes of Pongol and Mela were down there this evening, because their contribution against Olympiakos, when they were trailing in that game, they came on to win the game. They seized the moment. Jersey Dude, figure of fun at times at Anfield. The howler against Labour Cousin. Actually, even more important than the penalty save in many ways, was the fantastic save from Shevchenko at the end of the extra time. Benitez got it wrong, then got it right. He's emulated Mourinho, UEFA Cup, and now champions league. And finally, Liverpool having won the tournament five times, on now third, behind Milan Six and Real Madrid Nine. That's pedigree. This could be the dawn of a very exciting new year. I want to get a final word from Mark and from John and from Graham, and then it's Alan Green, 6-0-6. Mark, does this take you back 21 years to Rome and winning on penalties and the drama of it all? Exactly the same, and a far better game as well. But I mean, that 3-0 down half-time. Mark, I'm going to interrupt you, because we can hear from Rafa Benitez. Fantastic. After losing 3-0, losing players with injury problems at the end. Fantastic. Did you believe in half-time you could do this? What did you say? We changed things, we talked, and we changed different players. But the problem is, if the players believe you can do it. And what about Steven Gerrard and that goal, because it did seem to propel you? The captain? Yeah, it's good for us. When the captain scores and goes with this energy, all the team play the same. And Jersey Dudek, the save at the end of extra time, and then the penalties. Yeah, it's true, he has done a really good match, good game. And what about the whole experience for this club and what it means? And is your captain anyway? Steven Gerrard, did you really believe, did you really believe 3-0 down you could do this? No, no credit to this money, never let us put our heads down. We carried on fighting, and every one of us deserve credit. And I've just made up for these fans, these fans have saved up for weeks and months to come here tonight. Look at them, 35,000 to 15,000. You talked about your moment of history, Stevie, you talked about your moment of history, you've got that now. I'm just glad after the Karl and Cuff final, a few people questioned my commitment, so I'm just really happy I can be happy with me performing to lift the Cuff for the fans. Well that's Steven Gerrard, Mark, sorry you were saying before the Liverpool captain, so rudely interrupted you. Well, no, just the other thing as well, don't forget these players have had to live with the last 20-20 odd years, the last time that Liverpool won the European Cup, I'm absolutely delighted for them. Now, we don't know what Raphael Benitez said at half-time, I'm sure we will find out, but as half-time team talks go, it must be up there with one of the best. Plus, of course, his changes, and they were big and they were brave and they were bold, and they certainly had to be, but very cleverly, he just put to his back of his mind what happened in the first half. He must have been so, so positive to the players. I think the key areas for me were certainly the three goals in the six minutes, Mark, just really put them obviously straight back on an even keel, but do not ever forget that double save from Jersey, that much malign, the double save from Shechenko right at the end of the game, Liverpool route, they would have lost it 4-3. I'm so, so proud tonight, it's unbelievable. I know all you Liverpool fans want to speak to Alan Green and you will do so, but I want to get a word from John Toshak and Graham Taylor, it's only right we should finish like that. John, first of all... Well, I think that... You better not say, do you? No, I can see... I just go flashing back now, I can see Emlyn with a big smile on his face. I've been in for a long, long time, I can see Ronnie Moran, kicked by it on to the end of the road. There's so many lessons in tonight's game for coaches and for players alike, and just a fantastic night for all Liverpool players. The lesser Graham Taylor, never give up, never stop believing you'd never know where it might take you if you just hang in there. Absolutely right, I mean, Chelsea are listening to them sing, walk on, and tonight, and they've won the European Cup as well. It literally is very hard not to be emotional on behalf of all of these supporters. A fantastic night for them, one that goes down in the annals of football history. Well, it's a lovely touch there, Morientes, of course, who couldn't play, because he played earlier in the competition for Real Madrid, having a laugh with Rafa Benitez. It's been a privilege to be here, and lots of you, I'm sure, will want to speak to Alan Green. Here he is, the Champions League, if we can call it that. Champions League 606. You've heard the action taken in the report. Listen to the manager. Now, it's your turn. Have your say on the day's top stories. This is 606. United players and Arsenal players squaring up to each other. Right football, you can't even listen to the corner. Marcus Tudge has scored for Derby. Joval, a back on level 10. The lines have been spotted. It's a fantastic cross from Steven Gerrard. The touch paper has been lit. Take part in the UK's top football phoning. This is 606 with Alan Green. Forgive the noise, folks. What an astonishing European Cup final. Milan, remarkable in the first half. 3-0 ahead at the interval. European champions again, surely. Could Liverpool come back? No, don't be silly. But they believe, and by the hour it was 3-3. Still level, in extra time. De Penalti's, Tudek, the hero, Liverpool European Cup winners for a fifth time. Can you believe it? How did they do it? Now, it's your turn. Call 0500 909 693. Text 850 58. Email via the website and bbc.co.uk slash 606. And Izzy Clark will be drowning in your text, your emails and the message board. Right Izzy? Right. Understandably, Liverpool fans are delirious and delighted more so because of that marvellous comeback. They're fiercely proud of the second hub performance and of Jersey Tudek. For Milan fans, of course, after those three first half goals, desperate disappointment. As for the neutrals, all love the sheer drama and Liverpool's bounce back ability. The text number as ever 850 58 or you can email via the website bbc.co.uk slash 606. And here in 5 Live, we're also off to Liverpool with Anita Anand's party. But if you're wondering what all the fuss is about, listen to this. A 6-0-6 action replay. Shevchenko, do it! Liverpool and against all the odds. The team who are 3-0 down at half time. Liverpool have won the Champions League. Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart. This is amazing. On nights they will never forget. Liverpool are champions of Europe. 606, the complete football phone-in. Now, no morning minis tonight. You've got nothing to moan about. David and Watford, get us off to a good start. I'd be from Watford, mate, but I was born in L5. I'm as happy as Larry. I can't believe what happened. We've just watched three goals in the first half. The first one was bad and we couldn't believe what happened. The second one, we were angry. And by the third goal, we were laughing our heads off because we couldn't think we were 3-0 down, but we've done two bottles of wine. And to get to 90 minutes and be 3-0, and for Jersey to do that, to make that save and to go through on penalties, I think... I just can't believe me luck that I've seen the sides from 1977 through to this day and age, and possibly the worst side of all the sides that have won a cup. But by God, it's ours. We keep it, and I can't tell you how happy I am. And if Stephen Gerrard walks away at the end of this, I say, thank you, Stephen, shaken by the hand, and say goodbye. And my worries of any Spanish and Italian teams out there in the lucky minute, Jamie Carragher, they're going to say he's fit into their style of football because they aim as fast as ours, and he can do a great job. David, you've just reminded us, of course, that this being Liverpool's fifth time, they keep this trophy. Oh, Alan! It's not a replica. They keep this trophy. Alan, me and my wife both work in Central London, and we never knew that we knew so many Chelsea supporters. Our phones never stopped texting us from the 1-0, the 2-0, and the 3-0. And we were both laughing and crying at the same time. And by the time it got to 3-2, someone said to us, you can't defend this one. And we said, yeah, we will do it, and it's 4-2. Well, hey, David. And we have done no, mate. David, I'm telling you this. I've just been handed the full-time report, and I had to grasp it from the woman who was delivering these sheets because I was still not sure that it finished like this. No. Trust me, it did. And it pinched me, pinched me because I know I'm dreaming because at half past 8 and 45 minutes, we were walking away. David, thanks very much for giving us a great start to 6-0-6. Neal and Southampton. Alan, what a great night for Liverpool Football Club. At the end of the day, as a Southampton fan, I was gutted a couple of weeks ago when we went down, but at the end of the day tonight is restored Montfaith in football. At the end of the day, Liverpool have come back from absolute despair. At the end of the first half, and they pulled it off, they really, to score three goals in six minutes as they did, was absolutely superb, but they just did it. And do-deck, jersey do-deck, to make that save, I mean, at the end of the day, he's been a player that has been, at times, you know, had problems at Liverpool, but to save that last penalty for them was absolutely superb. And really, you know, as a Saints fan, I feel proud for Liverpool. I am so glad for their fans and for the players and for everyone connecting with Liverpool. I just think that is absolutely brilliant tonight. Really, always, on the edge of my seat, the whole night, in the second half, I had friends, I've got a guy who's never been a fan, I know, and half a dozen Saints fans, we were texting for the whole second half, and we were just absolutely gripped by it. And Liverpool, the way they came back, was absolutely superb. And I just feel so proud for English football that they came back, and they, you know, they did what they did, you know. You know, the first half was a bit more, but at the second half, they just all battled and battled and battled. And I feel so proud for them that, you know, as a club, their history as it is, you know, with all the four cups that they've won before, and to find that now they win this European, you know, this European Cup for the fifth time, and now they keep it, I just feel so great for them. They're absolutely superb night for English football, as well as, you know, Liverpool Football Club. I just feel so great, you know, tonight. Thank you very much indeed. That's wonderful. You know, amidst your disappointment, you can find the heart to rejoice, not just in Liverpool's triumph, but the triumph of English football. I can't imagine what it's like in Merseyside, for the BBC reporter, Derek Ivens, who's been on the pitch for a long time. Oh, sorry, Neil, I'm going to Derek Ivens in the middle of the city, Liverpool. Well, I can imagine what it's like, Helen, it's gone absolutely mad here in Liverpool. There are hundreds, thousands of people all over the city centre. I've never seen so many happy faces. There are police horses. Everyone wants to sing, everyone wants to be my best friend tonight. We'll get instant reaction to the game for a couple of fans, Kaz and Phil, Kaz, 3-0 down. What went right after that? Raphers, the tactics worked on the night, mate. We're back in Europe, we're back to take over. Steery-ass, what's happening? Take with the H-line, take with the H-line. I think you can hear how happy people are. Phil, you must have thought he was taken buried, but they showed great resilience, didn't they? Yeah, mate, I was about to go home and all that, but I stayed there. Poon, they're out of drink next minute, lad. They're fucking in for the ball. There you go, Helen, a lot of very excited fans here in Liverpool. I hand back to you. Hi, Derek, John is on Merseyside. Hello, John. Hi, Alan, how are you? What do you think I'm like after that match? I'm really a breath-backer. No, I'm still in stunned disbelief here. I've got to say, half-time, I just thought, join the half-time, it's all about respectability. That's exactly what we were saying. Damage limitation, you know, it's like, keep it three, and then you get one back, and all that has to apply. The sweetest thing to say, another Liverpool captain after M1, he's Phil Thompson, and soon, he's lifting that cup. I mean, it just feels so good at the moment. And, you know, that goes off to Benitez. I think he's...the decisions he's made during the Champions League run have been spot on. And I think with...I spoke to you all after the Chelsea game, and I acknowledged the fact that, you know, Liverpool's team at the moment isn't the best, but what you've done with this team is, you know, it's the umbilical, really. You know, I'm... I think there's a certain style that Benitez wants to adopt as Liverpool manager. And I think he feels that he needs a quite an influx of new players that suits him to play this style. I think there are many of the players who are playing for Liverpool tonight. I reeled them off, you know, at one stage. I thought there were seven players who might never play for Liverpool again after this man. Now, that might still be the case, John, but this manager believes in what he's doing, and this is the proof it works. Oh, that's what I was going to say. He's got some major decisions to make over the summer, with some of the players, you know, I think he's got to be tough. I mean, we'll enjoy today and we'll enjoy this summer, but, you know, we want to be the best team in England, you know, again. As well as the best team in Europe, we want to be the best team in England. And, you know, it's just been a marvellous night. And my final note is, too, this is Metsons, Moyes, Beggars and Marino, and Wenger, champions, champions of Europe, for the fifth time. Thank you very much, Mr. Benitez. And thank you very much, John, for your call on Merseyside. Also on Merseyside, Anita Arnan, in a giant party. Do you know what, Alan, this is the weirdest party I've ever been to. You know something, at halftime, you were miserable. You were thinking, how on earth was I going to sustain Erkheim at Five Life? Can I please just say, I very rarely get the chance on Five Life to say, I told you so. Mark Pugash said to me, it's going to be very difficult for you to lift the spirits. And I said, you know, don't write yourself. I know it's not fashionable to do this. I will come out right now as a red. And I said, do not write yourself. We're an optimistic bunch. We will come back. How smug do I feel right now? It was incredible, Alan. It was like a wake. It was absolutely silent. People were, they had their head in their knees, not even in their hands. In their knees, first goal went in. Suddenly people started perking up. Second goal went in. People started going to the bar and buying ridiculous amounts of alcohol. Third goal went in. It was euphoria. And I'll tell you, Vassus Alexander, who's across the road in the Philharmonic Hall, surrounded by some 600 or 700 Liverpool fans in the heart of Liverpool, got snogged by a fan on the third goal, didn't you? You got lucky. I know, I pulled. You did pull and he had a big beard. I know, and terrible breath, but you know, don't tell the misses. Boo to the Philharmonic Hall though, Anita, because they've closed the bar and people are just drifting out there. Not keeping the bar open later and people are, I've been asking them where they're going, a couple are going to Anfield, but mostly to the city centre and just a street party that I think is probably going on there. I have to say also, you did get it right. You did say you were optimistic at half time. I thought you were a loony. Yes, I knew. I thought you was barmy. Well, she was, frankly, but she got it right. Vassus, let me just cut in here, because as well as feeling smug, I wasn't the only one, because this is what happened right at the end, here in Liverpool. Get it! Get it! Get it! So Vassus, Vassus a little flavour, what's happening right now where you are? Well, people are just, they still can't believe it. They see me with headphones on talking into a microphone, they go, you know, what are you doing there, mate? And I said, I'm working for Radio 5 Live, and there's no, it's 606. There are messages that I have to deliver from here in the Philharmonic Hall. Oh, please do. About 150 you'll never walk alone. 175 championies, and mostly 670. Did that really happen? Alan did it. Can I just tell you something, Alan? You know some fans get a bit superstitious, and I've never been this way, but I sat on a stool here watching this in Liverpool, and I needed to go to the toilet. I'm sorry to be in decorous for 45 minutes, but because it was going well, I did not do so. And it worked, that's all I have to say. I think it was down to me. It was a miracle. Thank you both very much. Have a great night. I think you might do. Nicholas in St. Albans. Alan, Alan, I'm telling you something, mate, I'm absolutely buzzing here, Fela. But I also want to thank you, because in the Olympiakos Liverpool game, you provided the most amazingly descriptive and colourful commentary ever. So if you can get that on a CD and send it out to us in St. Albans, that'll be brilliant. And also, I want to say to Rafael Benitez, if he had blonde hair and feminine asset, although I'm married, I'll be asking for his hand. I've got to say, what a fantastic game. And I also want to just quickly compliment all the fans of all the other clubs up and down the country, because everyone, from Everton, to Manchester United, to Akron, to Stanley, to St. Albans City, have been saying, oh yeah, love to see Liverpool do well. Now I've got a very quickly party to my brother who's dying to speak to you. That's OK. Hi, Alan. Hi there. What's your name? I thought you was before when we were being asked, and I was on the mobile, I've seen you. I think one of the decisive moments in the game, which I don't know if you agree with me, was when he put DDRM on. Yes, for that question. You know, he managed to keep hold of the board, and all that Liverpool needed to do was to keep hold of the board, get their passes together and make Milan over commit. Once they started to do that and got the first goal, it was obviously up to the way, and actually for that we'll get to this sore leg stage now. I never thought about it, but I've just worked, can't explain it. You don't need to say anything else. That's your phone ringing as well. Have a great evening or what, Remain to me. By the way, it is five past one in the morning here. I don't want you to feel sorry for me. There's nothing to feel sorry for, but it's a late night, and I leave the hotel at five. So don't give me that busy, is he? I don't feel sorry for you at all. Chris and Rotherham says, as a neutral football fan of 50 years, I've seen such excitement and sportsmanship. What an advert to the world of football. Andrew and Glasgow, my hat has just been swallowed. Mark Hudson, I think he kind of sums it up, he says, now that's what I call a cup final. Quite a few people texted in at half time, writing very disparaging things about Liverpool. Chris and Newbury, Tim and Manchester and David Hartford had the decency to take it all back and say, sorry, I retract that. Now there have been loads and loads of Manchester United fans. Now of course Everton fans, Arsenal fans, Chelsea fans, Southampton fans, Baggies, they've all been taking and congratulating Liverpool, but there seemed to be a plethora of Manchester United fans, here's a couple of them, my God, that was fantastic, big time, absolutely bleep delighted from another, and Danny says, respect Liverpool, you're back where you belong. Gillian and Glasgow, I don't think Bernice says, practice taking penalties, I think they practiced saving them. Text number 85058, or of course you can email Father Website. I like that one, good one. Tony and Wigan. Hello Alan, Wigan Athletics fans, that was a fantastic achievement. And travelling home tonight, I got home an hour earlier because the roads were that quiet, it was unbelievable. It was a long time since I've seen the roads as quiet as that. And basically I think the fans and the players of Liverpool can bring respect back to this country, to the youngsters and everything else, because they were great ambassadors, it was just fantastic. It's fantastic that so many fans of other clubs are responding like that tonight, because I think it is very important, the Liverpool supporters acknowledge that this is not a great Liverpool team, they're not saying, oh, this team's going to rampage through the premiership next season. What they've done is achieve something, not just for themselves, but for the country as a whole. Yeah, I agree with you four. I think they've really brought the game forward, and it's going to be a daunting tap for Wigan Athletics facing them next season, I think. But all credit to Dave Whelan, and the fans of Liverpool, I mean, they're fantastic people. They've got a lot of respect, and I just thought that they can bring a lot of respect back to what's going on in the country with the youngsters and one thing or another, because these are the great ambassadors. In actual fact, in a way, they'll bring it back, better than the politicians will, just a fantastic achievement, just proud of them. Well done, well said, Tony. Thank you very much indeed. Mike is in Wales. Hi, Alan. I am totally stunned beyond belief. This is not possible. It could not happen. I've had checks from friends in Istanbul, from friends in London, from my daughter in London, from people on mergers. It's just unbelievable. I have to confess, at half time, I just thought, well, at least hopefully we can keep it respectable, we can maybe stop them scoring again, maybe because I want to make it respectable, but I'm totally stunned. This has got to be Liverpool's greatest European triumph ever. Well, it is. I think it is. They were up against the side that ostensibly is superior. Oh, without doubt? In the first half, far superior to Liverpool, but they still had belief. And I think this must say a lot, Alan, to all teams and all sports people in the world, about spirit over ability, because Milan had much more ability in this. The spirit and the belief and just the total determination that the support is over there. We could not let them down. I'm just staggered beyond belief. It's an old cliché, but this has got to be one of the greatest sports in triumphs. We see now that it is just staggering. Words fail me. I'm just staggered, Alan. You haven't done too badly to find a few words. Thanks for five lives. I worked on the telly, but I have the sound down. Your commentary, Alan Green, was absolutely stunning. Fantastic. Thank you. You've been part of history. Thanks, Mike. Graham Taylor has nailed her glued to his chair. I don't think Graham, you can believe what happened this evening. No, we can't, but it's fantastic listening to those callers in, listening to the singing. It's fantastic, really. For myself, as one of the managers, I have the privilege of going into that boot room. You can't help but think of those past managers. This club is a tremendous club with tremendous traditions. As I've said before, Alan, you know this, I've always considered the Liverpool supporters to be the most knowledgeable football supporters in the land, and I am so, so happy for them. Isn't it great tonight to hear supporters from other clubs? One of our first callers, Nielsen Southampton, here's a guy who's devastated at the relegation for his club this season, and all he wanted to talk about was Liverpool. Yeah, I mean, you come into a European Cup final, and in the main, everybody is behind the club, but in this particular case, it seemed even more so. You know, one, because of Liverpool, because of the traditions, because of the history, and because of their supporters. I mean, as you can see from us, it's been a fantastic night. It's been a privilege to be here and watch them win the Cup again, and for the fifth time, it's their Cup. It's their trophy. Can you imagine? This is another subject that will come up when people calm down a little bit. Can you believe that UEFA, after this, would deny Liverpool the opportunity to defend the trophy? Well, you wouldn't think so at all, would you? You just wouldn't think it shouldn't happen. But, God, you know what some of these people can do. I dare you, UEFA. Let's have another listen to the goals that made the penalty shoot out a possibility. Have your say on the day's top stories. 0500 909 693 851 858 bbc.co.uk slash 606 Another opportunity from Reeser. header, Joe Yes, a goal from Stephen Geron of Liverpool. Come on, 25 yards up, doesn't shoot. But, Smitsa, Mike, all the way from Vladimir Smitsa. Alonzo misses, but Alonzo puts in the rebound. Alonzo's there for the rebound. He didn't make the first save, but Alonzo was the first to react, and his scoreline is absolutely staggering. This is 606 with Alon Green. It's stunning, isn't it? Really remarkable night here in Istanbul, and that's after we slaughtered the choice of venue. Istanbul, and the ground, it's stuck in the middle of nowhere. I mean, there's no need for Graham Taylor to rush off. I can tell you because it'll take us hours to get back to the hotel. And we're all scheduled to leave that hotel at 5 o'clock in the morning, our time, which, by my reckoning, is only 2 and 3 quarter hours away. It might take us that time to get to the hotel. James and Knott's. Hi, Alonzo. I'm a scout through an exile, and let me tell you, I'm absolutely elated tonight. Absolutely elated. I've been watching the game in a pub with some mates who left at half-time because they thought we was dead and buried. It was becoming embarrassing at that stage. You know, my wife was with me, and she said at half-time, this could be the greatest comeback ever, and she was absolutely like, she was spot on the money. I think your wife needs to see a doctor if she forecasts that. She's the hopeless optimist, what I'm going to say. Absolutely. I mean, I couldn't see any reason for optimism. I looked at the bar at half-time and asked for Prozac. Now, what do you expect to happen in the summer? Do you think that Benitez would sit back and say, ah, well, we're European champions, we just carry on like this? I don't, I'm certain of that. I suspect it will still be a massive clear-eyed liver fool in the coming months. I think we're going to lose some players. Absolutely. But I think the spirit inside was summed up by the fact that Smita, one of the players who were going to leave, kissed the badge after he took that penalty. Well, he just wants to leave, but I gather his transfer back to Lawns is going to happen. Yeah, but also, I thought our weakest link tonight was Dudek, but we're signing Rainer in the summer. He was an absolutely superb keeper. Well, James, I take your point about Dudek, but he ultimately was the hero. He was the hero in the game. The double-saving nature of Shevchenko was astonishing. He was. I mean, his pace is fantastic, Shevchenko, absolutely. And we're going to face him at Chelsea, apparently, probably next summer, next year. But, you know, Dudek was great in the shootout, but if it hadn't been for him, we may not have been there in the first place. OK, James, thanks for your call. Johnny's in Newcastle. Hi, Alan. It's cold up in this cloud, let me tell you. Halfway through the first half, I was washing the bathroom. I had had enough and I was cleaning the bathroom, then I moved on. Nothing would make me do that, Johnny. No, I was. I was looking for something to hang myself, and I live in the ground floor flat. I had nothing to hang on, but to, you know, light and shade is too low. Absolutely amazing second half. I was actually sitting with the wife and we're clicking through Sky Active for a movie tour that was at 9 o'clock, by which time the second goal had gone in and I was back involved in it. Absolutely brilliant. When we got that penalty, a joy of getting the penalty, then it being saved, you're back into the depths of despair, then it goes in, he gets his own rebound. Absolutely unbelievable. Fantastic, mate. But what I have to go and say, we've got to, you're just going to make the point yourself. The leaders have to have a major clear out. You will do. One thing that should be bound by every player, it should be an instant yellow card, kissed in the badge. Well, I agree because too few players actually show the loyalty these days that allows you to kiss the badge without feeling even a might embarrass. Johnny, thanks very much for your call. I need to announce parties going on and deliverful. It is. Can I just say, it's a wonderful, wonderful atmosphere. It's one of those things where you'll read it in the papers tomorrow, you will wish you were there. We are here right now, so let's bring it to you. People still cheering, shouting, lots of after-match commentary going on in every corner of this place. And with me throughout the night, Darren Lewis from The Mirror, and also I've got to playwright Lawrence Wilson. Lawrence, let me just start with you first. You couldn't write this in a play. Could you know who would believe you? I think I'm going to give up playwriting because I could never ever write anything as fantastic as that. I mean, it just had everything, didn't it? It had, you know, all the tragedy at the beginning, humiliation at one point, you know, first half, you know, sorrow. And then it just the turnaround was amazing. Then it was just like this joyous, beautiful, poetic, fantastic thing, you know, that just, I've never seen anything like it in my life, you know. Darren Lewis, as far as sports history is concerned, where is this going to fit in? Well, I was going to ask Alan a similar question, actually, because obviously sometimes after victories by English teams, we tend to go into a bit of hyperbole, the best ever, the greatest, whatever. But just on the sheer scale of the task-facing Liverpool at half-time, 3-0 down against a side which was all-conquering and also playing at the peak of their powers as well to come back and to win, I would say personally, I think it's the best performance in a final by a Liverpool team. I don't know if Alan agrees with that. Well, just before we come back to you, Alan, to tell us, Vassus Alexander is here with us. And you were rubbing your eyes and sticking your fingers in your ears because you couldn't quite believe what was going on. Still can't, still can't. And talking about where it sits in final history, I think tonight is so big, tonight is so good, that I think even to have the conversation demeans it. I think that this is just head and shoulders above anything else that's happened in the European final. I mean, it's a European final, Liverpool with 3-0 down. It looked like men against boys for the first half. 3-0 down, that never happens. Manchester United did it against Tottenham, but that's, more frankly, that's Tottenham, sorry, Spurs fans. Anita, can Darren hear me? Yes, I think he can, absolutely. Now, Darren, don't shout at me, but I just think there's so many of us that have to eat humble pie tonight. And as somebody takes the mirror at home, I do remember a report that you did in the paper. I think it was after the Southampton game, when it could have been a sub-unit of his fault, but the headline was the worst Liverpool team in 40 years. Indeed, indeed it was. What were you going to do to that sub? Well, to be fair, I remember the match perfectly, and they'd lost to Southampton. That's right. It was a very, very poor performance. They were without Javier Alonso, who of course featured tonight. And a lot of the players who did so well tonight were very poor in that match. And as you know, Liverpool finished towards it. 37 points behind Chelsea in the Premier League. They've been hugely, hugely inconsistent in the league and not produced anything like the form that they produced in the Champions League. It's astonishing. I mean, Benitez can't explain that differential, and neither can we, which makes tonight's triumph even more remarkable. And the other thing I was going to say, Alan, and I'm willing to put my hands up again, last week Arsenal against Liverpool and Jersey due deck, you know, he was good in patches, but awful in others. Yet he's the hero tonight. That's football, Darren. Isn't that the beauty of the game that we love? Well, indeed it is. Alan, just before we leave you, the question we're asking here is what did Rafa Benitez say at half time? That's what we want to know. And if you have any idea, because we really, really want to know what turned it around, 85058 is the text number. And it's 606 at bbc.co.uk. What did Rafa Benitez say? That's what we want to know. Thanks very much, Anita. He doesn't say a great deal, Rafa, because his English is not as smooth as he'd wish it to be. He probably said something as daft as have confidence. He speaks a lot about having confidence. He gives you greater confidence. Well, boy, did they show it. Thanks very much, Anita. No doubt we'll get back to you. Back to the calls now. Jerry in Oxfordshire? Hiya. Hi, Dave. Well, he obviously made himself understood at half time, didn't he? He did. Because I don't know what he said, but I'd love to have been a fly on the wall. What a result. It was fantastic. At half time, I was all forgiving up and going. Just turning the telly off and walking away, but I'm glad I never. Well, Jerry, nobody could be blamed for turning the radio off or turning the telly off and finding something else to do, like cleaning the bathroom. But there you go. I wasn't driven to those lengths, believe me. There's no way I was driven to those lengths. Listen to your commentary. Telly turned down, but watching it on the telly, it was fantastic. I come from a mixed marriages, and Alan, mixed marriages don't work. My husband's an Evertonian, and I think he's got a face tripping into nothing. I don't know because he's in Australia, so I don't know. But Jerry, listen, I think what a great year it's been for Merseyside football. Because Everton did fantastically well to finish the course. I am so chuffed for Everton because for years, I say this mixed marriage for 25 years, and virtually every year it's been the last game of the season, and there's been a different combination of who's got a B2 and who's got a draw with who to keep Everton in the premiership. And I have been so chuffed that they've stayed off, and even that they've finished ahead of us there, I say, but, but I mean, tonight was just unbelievable. There's no way you wait for Can't Let's Defend That, not after tonight's draw. No, I don't think that they're in Europe. They can't see the Liverpool. By the way, we'd like you to play in Monte Carlo in August for the European Super Cup. And by the way, we'd love you to represent the continent of Europe in the New World Club Championship in Tokyo in December. They can't do that without allowing Liverpool the opportunity to lose the cup, if they're going to lose the cup, to lose it on the pitch. And by the way, just to let you know, Ancelotti, the AC Milan coach, has already said at his press conference, very magnanimously, I mean, he must be devastated, but he says he believes Liverpool should be allowed the opportunity to defend the trophy. It'll happen. Darren at Oxfordshire. Hi, Alan. Hi, Darren. I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. I'm still on Cloud 9, but I've got to go and explain to my son when he wakes up that Liverpool have won. Because I can't be the only dad in the country that sent his kid to bed at half-time saying, Oh, dear. Go on, son, off you go, it's all over. And off he went. And he went to bed. What age is he? No, he's only seven, but my God, I can't believe it. I tell you what. I'm in Asia. I'm going to tell him tomorrow, Liverpool won, three all, and then one of those penalties. I mean, I'm almost supposed to say. No, Darren, don't let him sleep through the night with that nightmare. Waking him. I have to say that the first half was like watching a road accident in slow motion. It was terrible. But 15, 20 minutes in the second half, they played some sublime football. And if they play like that next season, I can't wait. I just can't wait. Well, Darren, thank you very much. We've got so many callers lined up, but we're going to move on to them quickly. But first, is he? The night a new phrase was invented. Come on, lads, we're only three down. Thanks to Tim and Exeter. Dave sent in a text from his mate who's celebrating in the stadium, and the text read, The Mrs thinks I'm working, so does the gaffer, but I'm in Istanbul with Stevie and Rafa. I like that. I believe I've just witnessed not only the greatest comeback in European history, but the best win in European history. As a Midservisperer fan, I am proud to be English. Liverpool done us all proud. You're a fantastic club. Congratulations, Norm from Billingham sent that. Now, there have been loads and loads of wishes of good luck, and now congratulations from all across the world, not just all across Britain. Keith Doyle is an ex-pat in the Bahamas where it's 85 degrees and sunny. Everyone on the beach is wondering why there are screams from the bar. I'm crying my eyes out. The trophy is back where it belongs. Thank you, simply. Thank you to Rafa and the lads. 7 a.m. in Japan, people celebrating there. 3 a.m. in Moscow, people celebrating there. And I have had emails from Spain, France, Iraq, the USA, New Zealand, Germany, Mexico, Australia, Slovakia, Romania, Albania, Holland, Nigeria, Switzerland, Brazil, Malta, the West Indies, Hong Kong, Moscow and Ghana, as well as all across England. Now, if you're out there listening from overseas where you can't dial into the normal 606 number, if you want to email your telephone number to us, we may well try and contact you if you've got more to say and have a little bit of international flavour. Text number 85058 or you can email via the website bbc.co.uk slash 606. Thanks, Izzy. Let's say hello to Stuart and Kent. Hi, Alan. I hope you can hear me all right. My voice was all right before the football started. Yours isn't the only voice on the screen, trust me. Believe you, mate. I'm a wolf supporter, right? And I was shouting and hollering at the telly. The clothes were covered in sweat. I had to take them all off. Unbelievable. And I want to say that I think Benitez has got to be manager of the season. If only for that hard time. There's no silly giving the trophy out. Roy's got manager of the season. You know, absolutely brilliant. Can you hear me all right? Absolutely brilliant what he done. And I think he's got to be manager of the season. And I think we all got behind Liverpool because they're supported as some of the most honest and genuine in football and I'm really, really happy for them. And I think they do that European trophy proud. You have good luck next season with promotion under HODL. Oh, I think it's a certainty. Can I say one more thing before I go? Very quick. I had the pleasure of meeting Graham Taylor when he was manager of Wolves and he's a top man. He is too. It was great to see Graham was alongside us tonight. Thanks very much for your wishes to Graham, which I'll pass on. James in London. Hi, Alan. Hello there. You think you've been through a roller coaster. You've got to see it from my perspective. I've been a Milan supporter for 23 years. Oh dear, I'm sorry. Since I graduated from Loughborough University, a great sporting place in Britain, and went out for two years work in Milan. We were in the second division then, Ceri B, long before Berlusconi even breathed on us. And now it's come to this. Well, all I can say is my second point is very, very quick. Liverpool really deserved what happened tonight. It was fantastic to watch. I'm not a neutral. I have to concede brilliance and the best game of football I've ever seen. The second thing is, and I was talking to a man United supporter, Peter, during the match and through it and afterwards, is that when the Old Guard give way to the new, it has to happen. And this is what has to happen to Milan. That team has literally been together since 1984. From Berese through the three great Dutchmen, Rijkaard and Van Basten, Paola Maldini and Billy Costa-Curta through to what we saw today. It has to give way to the new now. That's the only way that football as a code that we all love and cherish can move forward. The same is true for man United after Saturday. I completely applaud Liverpool's performance today. It was unbelievable. The country should applaud and be proud. As a Scott, a Tallyo Scott, if you like, I cannot do anything but had in magnanimity the brilliance of what we saw tonight. And Stephen Gerrard, he's the best player in the world. Thanks, James. Join Manchester. Alan, I don't know what to say. We were sitting in Manchester tonight. Most of us were Manu fans and we were just over the moon. I don't know if all the Manu fellow supporters in the country would agree, but my voices saw. I was jumping up and down. We're so happy for Liverpool. We may be the rivals. We'll see you next season. We'll be against you again. But tonight, I was a scouter for the night. Joe, it's a win for English football. It's a win for English football. Exactly. You'll dance and sing and you'll never walk alone. All of Manu fans. You were singing as a Manchester United fan. You'll never walk alone. Believe me or not, what I knew of it, what the words I knew of it, I was singing that. It's scary to believe, but yeah. One thing I wanted to ask you, Alan, what would you put as an English supporter, what would you put this win better? Is it the Manu or Bayern Munich or tonight? Well, you know, I think tonight shades Barcelona. And I'll tell you why, because United had a momentum that night in the second half in Barcelona. And though I was, of course, as amazed as anybody else watching, the United scored twice in stoppage time to win it. What a dramatic climax. Just sitting here at half time, I was thinking how many goals will Milan score? Will it be an embarrassment, a further embarrassment for Liverpool and for English football at that stage? I mean, what would have happened? What would we be saying if Liverpool had been tonked 6-0? That's why I've got to say that this recovery just shades Barcelona. I couldn't agree with you more, Alan. I'm over the moon for Liverpool. Go, you Scouts, go on, you Liverpool supporters. We're United fans, we'll with you all the way. Thanks very much indeed, Joe. Let's hear now from the Liverpool captain, Stephen Gerrard. And I thought it was going to be tears and disappointment and frustration at the end. But we kept going and, as I say, we scored an early goal and I think that put a bit of belief in the team and we kept fighting till the end. But we've beat some magnificent sides in this competition and no one can take away that we deserve to be Champions League winners. I just hope that the people above let us defend it. You know, to call the Champions League, so the champions should be able to defend it. And do you know what he also said tonight? How can I think of leaving after that? That is the clearest sign that Stephen Gerrard will stay on at Anfield. Anita Anand. Alan, guess where I am? Yes! You could be in Liverpool. I think you kind of get the idea. Let me just tell you, we're out on the street now. We're actually weirdly standing in Hope Street. Hope doesn't even cover what the people felt at a half-time. But right now, let's just hear from the people who have been supporting this team, who are now out on the street, waving to buses, cars. There are flags in all the cars going by. Actually, the traffic's kind of come to a standstill. Did you believe we would be here right now, cheering like this at a half-time? Honestly, yes. Last week I had a feeling and you would win. I didn't. I was heading my hands. I didn't think we'd do it. He did believe me. I was in bit. He'd given up a half-time. It's a beautiful night. Caroline, you are in fact an Evatonian. An Evaton fan. How do you feel tonight? I am actually really, really pleased. Wait, wait, wait. Have some grace here, because Caroline has a lot of grace here. Thank you. I'm not bitter. I am an Evatonian, but I'm delighted today. I am thoroughly, thoroughly delighted for the Red. They deserve it. Just describe the scene. We're actually standing pretty much on a traffic island in the middle of the street. What's going on around us? I've been to South America. I've been there through Carnivore. This is just amazing. This is just fantastic. Everyone's just pulling up, beeping their horns. People climb out the windows, out the sun moves. It's just fantastic. It's fantastic. Just great feeling. Alan, in a way, it's kind of people coming to terms with what they just can't believe, that people rubbing their eyes and thinking, did we really just see that? And it's an incredible atmosphere right here in the heart of Liverpool right now. What I need to do, Anita, is to actually use a sharp object to make sure that I believe what I've just seen this evening. I really have to. Back to you again soon, Anita. Thanks very much. No, would you believe it. I want to go to Milan. To Brian. Hello, Brian. Hi, mate. How are you? Oh, no, there's a Sky accent. Thanks. Go ahead, Brian. I've lived out here 12 years, mate. I tell you, tomorrow morning, I am going to get some grief at work. I am going to get some severe grief at work. Tell us, what did you watch the game? I hear the game. Where were you? I was at home. You were at home. I did not go down the pub. Have you dared to look out the front door? More or less, but this way. Let me take my home phone off the hook. What did you think of the game, Brian? I thought it was absolutely brilliant. I'll be honest with you, at half time, I said to my missus, I'm going to go down the pub and face it, because I'm an Intervalan fan. I sort of lived between Turin and Milan. I can be in both cities within half an hour. I said, I'm going to go down the pub and face it. When Gerard scored, I said, we're going to come back. When the penalty went in, especially off the rebound as well, I just couldn't believe it, mate. It was easy to overlook the fact that that was brilliant technique from Alonso, because he didn't just rush in and try to blast. He played very carefully into the roof of the net. I just couldn't believe it. Gerard, for my liking, didn't come into the game until the second half. I agree with you. I thought, didn't he just come in with it? Did you hear the news? I basically passed on there. He has said, how can you think of leaving Liverpool after this? I heard you there, because normally I can get you on the AM, but I just can't pick you up tonight and the internet connection is down. I just basically rang up my open. It was a 6-0-6 tonight, because I don't care now. I didn't give you as much grief as I like. Can I suggest, Brian, how you might write a suicide note? Basically, get a shirt that's born into... No, walking my luck. ...in Gemma Lan on one side. ...and I've seen Melanthus years on, don't I? Brian, thanks very much indeed for your call. Thank you, Gerard. All the best. Steven Coventry. Hi, Alan. Hi, Steve. I said to my lad at half-time tonight, I said, you know, I can't see Liverpool coming back from this. And basically, I was down, but I've got to say, I am so proud of that side. I'm a lifelong Manchester United fan. And the way they pulled themselves back, Steven Jowell was awesome in the second half. And I just thought they deserved to win on penalties in the end. But it just made me feel... I actually got quite emotional towards the end of the game. And for a Manchester United fan, that's hard. But really, they made me feel so proud to be English and to watch them lads do so good tonight. And Dodeck was absolutely awesome in the penalties. Steve, forgive me for repeating myself, but it is as much a triumph for English football as it is for Liverpool. Oh, it's kind of a thing. Yes, I agree. It's exactly the same as six years ago. Yeah. And it really made me feel warm inside tonight. And to all those Liverpool fans out there, whether they're at home or in Turkey or wherever, you know, my heart is with them tonight. Absolutely fantastic. They made this game in this country all the more high profile. It's fantastic. OK, thank you very much indeed for your call, Steve. We've already heard partly from Rafa Benitez during the programme tonight on five live, and this is what he says on the difference he thinks is between Liverpool's performances in the Premiership and those in the Champions League. Because it's a different competition. When you play for nine months and you play knockouts, and it's different, and we have done a good job. During the Champions League games, and we control the tempo of the games. If you score, if you don't score, then we control these things. In the Premier, we play always with another tempo, really high tempo, and it's more physically different. I told you, it doesn't get worked up, does it? You know, it's the same sort of levelled response to every single question. Heaven only knows what he'll talk like when he learns English properly. Right, Darren and Lise? I can't believe it. I'm lost for words. The whole of English football actually can't believe it. Did he have one? What a guy. He was fantastic for Liverpool tonight. When Stephen Gerrard went right back at one point, past the junior, I felt sorry for him. You mentioned him, and Gerrard, there was obviously a possibility that Gerrard would leave Liverpool. It seems he won't now after this. Man, it appears there's almost sign for Bolton. There'll be others who'll be moving away. Is that maybe the best ever response from being 3-0 down? No team has ever come back from 3-0 down in the European Cup final to win the European Cup, however it's won on goals or penalties. I just cannot believe it. I'm lost for words, really. Well, Darren, I think we're all out tonight, but I'll tell you what, it's a smashing 6-0-6. We'll just be in Europe next season. Not to the detriment of Everton, but surely we'll come back. Definitely not. There's no way that Everton would be pulled out of the Champions League, but I think that UEFA will accept. However much they're embarrassed by the situation, given the drama of this triumph, the way it will reverberate, not just in England, throughout Europe, but across the world, they cannot allow a situation to arise that Liverpool would not be able to defend the trophy. I have to agree with you. Your commentary tonight was absolutely fantastic. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the compliment, Darren. I thought Mike England was actually brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. It was a privilege to work alongside him. Thanks, Darren. All the best. James and Sheffield. Hi, Alan. I just want to say, well done to Liverpool, because that was better than Manu in Barcelona. It really was. I'm a neutral. I was watching both games, and it was absolutely fantastic. It epitomised, basically, both the league. Liverpool won through grit and determination, whereas Milan, for the Italian league, they just crafted their goals out through the Italian craft and everything, and it was absolutely amazing. What did you think happened to Milan? Had it become too easy for them at half time? Going into the dressing room three-nil, I wouldn't blame them for thinking, oh, this is one. I don't think so. I think they came out with the same mindset. They were going to keep it tight and try and score more goals, but Liverpool just came out and they went for it, and they hit them so hard. In the same way that PSV did as well, they hit them, and they scared them and they shocked them. It just showed up how much grit and determination can win over technicality as well. I would just have to say, I'm so happy for Liverpool. I'm not a Liverpool spore or anything, but when you saw them win and you saw how happy they were to win it, you just loved it. It was fantastic. I'm really pleased that you took the trouble to ring in. Thanks very much indeed for your call. Tomorrow, if I ever make it back to the hotel and I forget my suitcase, then I will be heading to London and then on to Chicago. We're going in that direction now. Mike is in Texas. Hello, Mike. Hi there, hi. I'm a Liverpool support. I've been a Liverpool supporter for as long as I can remember, because my dad comes from Liverpool and he's an Everton supporter. So, you know, the usual father-son relationship. We're all with you two. What a fantastic game. I actually missed the first half because... You were lucky then. We had to sit through the first half, and it was torture from a Liverpool perspective. No, I know. I was trying to find it, but the TV people over here didn't have it. So I was looking on the web and all I could get was the written commentary that's going through. I heard... I was speaking to my wife just after it started, and she said Liverpool were down already and oh no. And then when I looked on the web, they were 3-0 down. And I thought, oh, God, this is going to be a disaster. And then the second half was just fantastic. It's almost as if the spirit swapped over at half-time. I don't know what happened. It was astounding, Mike. I don't know what happened. By the way, where about are you in Texas? I'm in Fort Worth. Right. Would you like me to nip down? The weekend. I'll just nip down. Catch a flight from Chicago. Ignore this England game against the United States. And I'm coming to have tea with you. OK, yeah. Mike, thanks very much. It really is fantastic to get a call from the United States on a night like this. Thanks very much indeed. What about this? We've gone west. Now let's go east. Pret is in Kuala Lumpur. Alan, how are you doing? How are you? I'm shocked, amazed. What more can I say? What more can I ask for in life today? Pret, how did you follow the game? Was it on television in Kuala Lumpur? Yeah, I basically flew in from Sydney early on today. And checked in the hotel, made sure the TV was on, went downstairs at the bottom of the hotel. There was on a big screen. And three nil down, I was about to go to bed, honestly. Like most other people. Yeah. Are you heading further west? Are you heading back to England or do you live in Kuala Lumpur? I'm heading back to the UK next. I'm actually going to Borneo at the weekend. You've done life, haven't you? Well, yeah. I only flew out from London on Saturday. Oh, well, that's your one. So I landed in Sydney on Monday and KL today, Borneo on Monday. And I know there are a great many Liverpool fans in the Far East, particularly in Kuala Lumpur. Have you been able to experience the response there? You know what? I've got to give credit just to the people at the hotel. I basically kept the bars open until half, five, six, whatever time we finished. I don't think the managers knew, but the people who worked behind the bar, they let us go behind the bar, pour our own drinks. I met some great guys from Australia. There were some Germans there, but they kind of left after full time because they were giving it a stick for the first 45 minutes. But then after that, they suddenly went quiet somehow. They suddenly just went a bit quiet after 3-3. So what time is it with you, Pret? In Kuala Lumpur at the moment? It's 45, the sun's about to rise and I've got the twin towers in my windows. Well, I have a lovely stay in that wonderful city and a safe journey home. And thanks very much indeed for being in contact with us here on 6-6. It's been ages since actually, the telephone number is to call, but it's as if it doesn't matter tonight. You know, you're not using telephone lines, you're just getting through the ether. 0-500-909-693, is he? And keeping up the international theme, I'm struggling to keep on top of these emails, coming in from South Korea, Canada, Norway, lots from Poland, supporting Jesse Dudeck from Nepal, from Malaysia, and loads more from Canada, the USA, all over Europe. It's absolutely incredible tonight. Just a taste from Poland. Michael says, just can't believe it. Switched off the box before the break, switched it back on after the break, and someone has said, proud to be English. We are proud to be Polish too. Mike Allen says, I thought the baggies had the ownership of boing-boing in the Great Escape, but Liverpool have eclipsed everything well done, a lifelong baggies fan. On the subject of maybe what Rafa might have said at half-time, Nail says, he just said, walk on. Alex the Hammer in London says, at half-time, Rafa said, OK lads, we've got them just where we want them. Ken says, some of the players may not be British, some of the managers may not be British, but a British club tonight did something, Churchillian. Matt in his car in Cheltenham, Matt, I hope you don't regret sending this in, has just split up with his wife, but he says, we won the cup, I'm sleeping in the car, yet I'm so happy, come on, you mighty wrens. That takes numbers 85058. Thank you very much, and Anita Anand is in that Liverpool party? Yes, absolutely. You know, you might be wondering, what is it like to be an Italian? Actually, be a Milanese in Liverpool right now. Not what you'd expect actually, because I'm joined right now by Nounza Bertali, who's the Italian consul for Merseyside. You spent mostly informative years in Milan, but then 23 years working here in Merseyside, is it fair to say you were quite happy tonight? I'm delighted, you know, it's unbelievable. Liverpool deserve to win, and they've done it, and I expected them to do it, and I think they fulfill everybody's expectation here in Liverpool. Nounza, that's lovely to say it here. Your friends, your family, everyone you know in Italy, are going to speak to you again for having these feelings. I think they will, because besides everything else, I'm a Juventus supporter, you know, so I would never support you. You don't mind. They seem to land, no way. Actually, watching this game as well, your son, Luca, and Luca, you're not even ashamed to say this, you are through and through, cut you in half, you are a Liverpool fan. I am a Liverpool fan, but I'm also a Juventus supporter, so I've already suffered through the big game, like three months ago. So there was no heart-string pull on you, but okay, Milan is with me. AC Milan are number one enemies. Really? Did you believe it would be like this? I didn't. I thought once the first goal went in, I thought we were in serious trouble, and we managed to fight back, and it's an extraordinary night. One of the interesting things I've just learned about you is that you're also an interpreter for the Italian football team. I did, I did do some interpreting, yeah, yeah, that's right. So just tell me the shockwave. Tell me the shockwave this is going to send through Italian football. It's going to be phenomenal, phenomenal what's going to happen in Italy. I don't think, definitely not Milan were expecting this to happen. For the rest of Italy, Juventus supporters, Inter Milan supporters, they will be very happy. I mean, the hatred there is quite strong. Right, first of all, Alexander is here for this. An Italian side, an Italian side. You pride yourself, I say you, you're a Liverpool fan, but you know what I mean, you pride themselves on defence. You've been in a lup at half-time, it's all over. That's right. You said that Juventus fans will be happy because you can laugh at AC Milan, but actually, won't Juventus fans be thinking, how on a minute this doesn't mean to happen to an Italian side? Oh, totally, totally. But Juventus won the championship, they've managed to nip it right at the end, and they'll be ecstatic. Let's just get the diplomatic voice here. Nensia, your homeland right now, what's going to be going on there in Italy? I think they will be devastated, especially in Milan, you know, because really, I don't think they expected to lose, because really, in Milan, I see they think they are very good, a very good side. Are you suggesting that there's slight arrogance there, is that what you're saying? Diplomatically, of course. Yeah, maybe not arrogance, but they're gaining, they think they are very good, they always look at Juventus, I think, in the Juventus still, in their cups, in their league, whatever, you know, and because they are very good, and tonight, they didn't show they were so good. Right, there you go, Alan. So, Italian voices here in Liverpool, albeit Juventus voices a little bit, but yes, it's really not what you'd expect, I think. Thanks, Ennico, we're obviously sort of shoving the schedule aside on five live tonight, because of this remarkably dramatic evening, 6.06, it was meant to start at 10 o'clock, I don't know what time I got on air, but I'm running through until Anita will take over comprehensively, but it has been a fantastic night of drama and history, and here's why. Have your say on the day's top stories, 0500 909 693 850 58 BBC.co.uk slash 6.06. In goes the free kick of the shot comes in, and it's there, Milan have scored, and Maldini, the captain, is being absolutely submerged by his teammates. The goal has been timed, well, a minute maybe only at the game, just over. Milan on the break here, here's Schiffchenko, Schiffchenko crosses, it's 2-0. Cacca, all towards Crespo, Crespo's through, this could be 3-0, and it is 3-0. Another opportunity from Risa, header, Joe, yes, a goal from Steva Gerrano, of Liverpool, a man 25 yards out, doesn't shoot, but Smitsa might all the way from Vladimir Smitsa. Maybe it's not mission impossible after all, Milan 3, Liverpool 2, Alonso can complete the most remarkable turnaround here, up against the enormous Dida, the Brazilian in the goal, Alonso, misses, but Alonso puts in the rebound, Dida make the first save, but Alonso was the first to react, and this scoreline is absolutely staggering. AC Milan 3, Liverpool 3. The greatest striker in Europe at the moment, André Schiffchenko, the European footballer of the year, he wants to get on with it, but of course if he misses here, Liverpool, against all the odds, have won the Champions League. Schiffchenko, 2-0! Liverpool! Liverpool have won the Champions League! Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart! 6-0-6, the complete football phone-in. And to top all that, Stephen Gerrard announces within the last half an hour, how can I leave Liverpool after that? Gerrard stays at Anfield. Claire is in London, hi Claire. Hiya. How you doing? I'm fine, I just wanted to say that I'm not a scoutser, but I've been a Liverpool fan for about five or six years since I've known my boyfriend, who is out in Istanbul at the moment, and he's out there at the moment, I'm all on my own to my home, I just needed someone to talk to. That's alright. Do you want to talk about football or should we talk about something else? No, no, I want to talk about football. The fans have just been amazing, I listened to 6-0-6 at the half time, and even though we were 3-0 down, the fans listed everyone, they were amazing, absolutely amazing. How did he get out here? Did he travel today or have he been out for a couple of days? He's a season ticket holder with his dad and he flew out yesterday, and he's just had the most amazing time. I spoke to him just after the match, and he just said, I was in tears at half time, and he said everybody was, so it's just been amazing. Claire, the airport will be mayhem, but I don't think your boyfriend will, he won't need a plane. He's got to go home, he's got to get back to home. And nobody flaps his arms on this adrenaline, he'll be home under his own steam. He's got to get back to work tomorrow. He's coming straight back to work in London tomorrow morning. And what did you think of the match, Claire? It was just amazing, I was so over the moon, as I said, I was in tears at half time, and I was in tears at the end of the match. It was just amazing. As I said, I'm not a scouser, but I'm a Liverpool converter, I've been up to Anfield a couple of times now, and the fans are just the best, they are amazing. Thank you Claire, safe home to your boyfriend, thanks for ringing. Alright, bye. Obviously I could talk to Claire all night, but I'm sure she'll go to bed eventually. Stephen, the M6. Hi, Al, the God of Radio, how are you? I'm well, what about you? Are we your Alan Wright? Yes, yes, yes, just a good one. I can't, Steve, don't worry. I seem to have some lady coming across with a walkie-talkie from Five Lives, so if I get a bit of delay talking to you, no way. Okay, Steve, go ahead, what are your thoughts tonight? Well, I'm absolutely bouncing, absolutely chuffed. I've been on a drill in the early... You know what I mean, I've been on a drill in the early night. I was excited, I'm too excited, you know what I mean? I was coming up the M6 and I was a bit depressed earlier on, I was on my way to rugby, and then I got to, funny enough, one of the sponsors of the Champions League, I think they still are continental, I went there, and I managed to put the workforce in stop for about 20 minutes, because they're all crowded on my radio. And when Liverpool scored the... Well, I was coming down the M6, I banged my head twice on the cab roof, because I was so chuffed when the second and third goals went in. I was absolutely chuffed, I was over the moon, and then when he just said, Steve and Gerard staying, they made my night. It's been a great night for Gerard, for Liverpool, and for English football. Steve, thanks very much, have a great remainder of the evening. Goodness, there's not that much left, it'll be morning in about eight minutes time. Conor and Belfast. Good evening, how are you? Hello, Conor. I'm absolutely over the moon, I can't just believe it. I spent the whole day praying, I'm thinking and hoping, and all I could do was think about the match. 3-0 down, it's got to be all over. Went to a different pub, stopped with Milan fans, Manchester native fans, I said it was all over. My cousin, he's an ABU, said it's not all over. Liverpool's going to come back into it, and they did. Oh, how they did. But I can't believe they did it, you know, I really can't, Conor. It was just an astonishing 15 minutes after half-time. You've got to look at 11 players, or 12 or 13 players who are involved, they all worked, they worked, and they worked, and they worked, and they never stopped. Raffi Benitez needs a big pat on the back, and Steve Bjarre is staying. This has got to be the start of something new, this has got to be the start of this big Liverpool team. Surely you're going to have to win this league the next couple of years. Conor, thanks very much for your call. Let's show Derek Ivins in the radio car. Yeah, Highland, it's all going on here in Liverpool. There's absolutely thousands of people milling about, they're approaching me, they all want to sing, oh dear, there's some rather body parts coming out as well. Did everybody enjoy the game? Did you enjoy the game? I've played a superb game, I've waited years for this moment. He's got a match in Istanbul now. Yeah, by half-time, I thought it was going to be very easy. I thought, just come out and make some pride yourself, get some pride back, I'd never expected it to be free. So it would be Sir Raffa or St Raffa or what? St Raffa, St Raffa, they're just wanting to see a man on the field. God bless you, the Gerards. And the biggest thing is, this is a new start for Liverpool, they've been asleep and joined for so many years, you're back in the big time now, can you build on it? I don't know, I think... I've had a new start, we weren't the way for Cup, we was like a new start for us, but this is it now, we can pull up players in, we can do it, and we've got to build on it. You can hear the confidence of the fans there, Alan, people are going to be partying all night, the next few days I think as well, and when the team arrive back tomorrow, we can expect the whole of Liverpool to turn out for them. Thanks very much indeed, Derek, and Nija must be nearby with her party. Absolutely, right here, right here, right now, still in Liverpool, do you know what, no one's going home Alan, it's really strange, it's chucking out time, but does anyone care? No, because I think actually Baselos, the party's going to go on pretty much all night, don't you think? I know, I just feel sorry for everyone who's working tomorrow morning, there's going to be some excuses, isn't there, the dog ate my homework. Actually that's a really good point, because there are a lot of people who are not in Liverpool, who are going to stay up quite a lot of the night, what is the excuse you're going to give your boss tomorrow morning? We're going to be taking over in a little while time, so yeah, 8-5-0-5-8 is our text number, and Nita at bbc.co.uk, what is the excuse you're going to give to your boss tomorrow morning, Baselos, I'm still worrying about this half-time talk, what was it? Could he have done better than your half-time team talk, which was, let me remind you, let's keep everything crossed, it's not over yet, I thought you were a loony. Yes you did, actually you even said that, Baselos, you said you're deranged, you're delusional, and you're a loony, and then you walked away from me, and I still said, actually we're going to bring it back, to tell you the truth Alan, I wasn't sure, but my mouth did the talking, and my brain did the thinking, and my heart is now beating very, very fast. You keep controlling yourself, Nita, you don't lose control on Merseyside the night like this. I'll do my best Alan. I was just thinking, you see, if I said to my wife, I stayed up all night, I didn't go to bed, she would climb me around the face, she knows something, she knows tonight, because it's already almost two o'clock here, and as I say, I'm leaving the hotel at five o'clock, and I might never get back to the hotel. Don't bother with the hotel, just come over here. Really, this is where it's happening, just take whatever you need to do, and just go over here. OK, Nita, look forward to joining you, so to speak. Izzy. Matt Booth says, at 5.45 am, all alone in my room in Hong Kong, watching the game with Cantonese commentary, when Dudek saved that penalty, I shouted my lungs' horse, and heard shouts from the upstairs flat, the downstairs flat, and the building across the road, just goes to show that there are reds all over the world, and you truly never walk alone, even in the wee small hours. Alex in Fulham says, tonight, for reasons beyond human comprehension, God is wearing a shell suit, a moustache, and a nasty perm. Nice to see that the stereotypes remain intact. Mark from Fife in Scotland says, fantastic. Emlyn Hughes, John Peel, Bob Paisley and Shanks will all be celebrating in heaven tonight. Thanks, Izzy. Stephen Northwells. Oh, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, what a night, what a night. I don't know how long it's going to take you to get back from Istanbul, mate, but it's going to take the rest of my life getting back from the satin, because I'm in the stars tonight, pal. I'm in the stars. What a night. I could not believe it. The girlfriend's gone to bed now. I've had to wait till I passed down for her to go out of bed, saying, yeah, no, it's been a good night, and I've gone outside, taken the dog out for a wee, and I'm crying, Alan. I cannot stop crying, and I'm not. I'm not a Liverpool fan. I'm just an English, I'm an English, I'm a Cultist United supporter. I'm a woman dadder from Manchester. I've been bred to hate Scouts as Alan. Well, Steve, you're doing yourself proud tonight. I'm tired. I'm tired. I've cried four times in my life. I've got three daughters, Alan. I'm not a Scouts, or I hate them, and tonight, I... Oh, God bless all of them. God bless them. And God bless you, Alan. That commentary tonight was unreal, with my heart pounding. So was mine, and so was my second issue. Steve, thanks very much for your call. Janet and Liverpool. Hiya. Alan, I had to ring in, because there's been no actual Liverpool pudleons ringing in. I'm actually Liverpool. I know when they're on the bar, or whatever. I don't blame them. What is so good is that people from all over the country, all over the world, are ringing in and saying, like, you know, how good Liverpool are doing, and how well they've done, the City of Holiday in Italy, and left the bar half-time and wrote them off, and we were still here. What a result. We came back, we won, we've got them all. Jan, thank you very much indeed. Thanks for being the last caller on 6-0-6, this very late Wednesday night. Is he's got a final email? This is from Ian in St Albans. Boring, boring Liverpool. Played for the draw and penalties from the start. Not. Our next to the last 6-0-6 of the season will be on Bank Holiday Monday. Mark Chapman takes your calls on a whole weekend of action from the playoff finals. Make sure you join him in the phones. That's between 6 and 8 o'clock on Bank Holiday Monday. That's all from me in Istanbul tonight. Liverpool, fantastic. Next on 5 Live, more from Anita Anand's Liverpool Party. Good night.
