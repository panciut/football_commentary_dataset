  "transcript": " Brazil against Serbia, it is the last of the opening round of group games because we are back into the second round with groups A and B tomorrow. And obviously Wales and England will both feature here on five live and BBC sounds. Again, another enormous roar goes rifling around the stands here at the Lusail Stadium. We are underway. Brazil have Alisson in goal, Danilo Marquinhos, Thiago Silva and Alex Sandro as a back four. Casamiro is the holding midfielder, Lucas Paketa and Neymar combining in central midfield. Raphinha and Venetius Jr, the wide men and Rashalisson as the centre forward and Thiago Silva there Chris Sutton has just got a welcome to the World Cup and been clattered and not to the floor. He doesn't look best pleased. Well, why would he be? It's really interesting this game because we talk about the Brazilian forwards and the swagger, the superstars that they have. There's Neymar getting involved early on a little tussle. They'll be really fired up, but this Serbian team, they're street wise, they're strong, they're solid and they are looking to spring a surprise. So they play the back three, their left-sided centre back is under pressure from Raphinha. Brazil have gone flying into the challenges early. Raphinha has committed the foul. Vanya Malinkovic-Savic is the younger brother of Sergei Malinkovic-Savic. He is in goal, winning only his seventh captainite. He plays his club football for Torino, all in green. I'll tell you what, he's got some clearance on him. He's smashed the ball downfield with his right foot beyond everyone and it's gone away for a goal kick. Nikola Milenkovic, Milos Velkovic and Strahinja Pavlovic are the three centre backs from right to left. Andrea Zivkovic and Filip Mladenovic are the two wing backs. Sasa Lukic and Nemanja Gudel of Sevilla provide the real sort of solidity that Chris is talking about in midfield. Malinkovic-Savic, Sergei Malinkovic-Savic and Dusan Tadic in support of Alexander Mitrovic, who obviously came into these World Cup finals with a foot injury, has been playing through a bit of pain for Fulham. He's absolutely vital to the national team's cause. But saying that, Chris, you've got the likes of Liovic and Jovic on the bench as well. They're not short of attacking talent actually, Serbian. No, and we saw the difference the substitutions made for Japan yesterday. So they do have options on the bench. I suppose with Mitrovic as well is... Look, I think the Serbian fans will be delighted to see him in the team, but how fit is he? Mr's last couple of Premier League games, didn't he? I think it was an ankle injury. Yeah. They'll hope he's up to full capacity and can make an impression as he's made for his club this season in the Premier League. Thiago Silva plays a ball to his left-hand side to Alexandro. Both teams are oppressing each other here. Dusan Tadic is chasing Thiago Silva down to the byline. He clears with his left foot and Zivkovic. The right wing back high up, blocks the pass and it goes out for a throw into Brazil in their left-back position. It is interesting what Tim Vickery said earlier about Thiago Silva. You know, they have Militão, who is, I think, more mobile. And, you know, the interesting is that backfoul are isolated. He does lack a little bit of pace and that may be an area which the Serbians look to exploit. That right-hand channel for them, the left-hand channel of Brazil. But with Tadic and Mitrovic, they aren't necessarily the quickest players around. Dazzling skill early on from Venetius Jr. Heading the ball down to himself. He's continued to run through the middle. It's wide with Raphinha on the right-hand side. Brazil going through the gears early on. Low cross comes into that Serbian penalty area and it is cleared. And I think that ball will run out for a throw in to Brazil on the right. Three and a half minutes in. Five live and BBC sounds. And this is Brazil against Serbia live in full from the Lusail Stadium. It actually is a city itself just north of Doha. And I think you can hear that atmosphere wherever you're listening to us this evening, coming through loud and clear. Throw in for Serbia now, inside their own half on the left. Mila Denević takes it. Milinkovic, Savic on the turn. Volley's the ball forward into the Brazilian half. Alisson is able to collect that under no pressure at all. I think he's had a little haircut and a sort of trim. He's got rid of the beard and gone to the sort of handlebar mustache for this World Cup. He's all in light grey. Brazil have lost the ball inside their own half. And then Vinicius Jr. was very quick to come and win that back for Brazil. Trying to dribble across his own half. Tackled by Milinkovic, Savic. Another challenge from Milinkovic, Savic there. Paquetar thought he should have had a free kick, but it's actually gone out for a throw in to Serbia on the halfway line, on the left. Vinicius Jr. doing well initially. Pick pocketing Milinkovic, Savic, but... Milinkovic, Savic doing the same back. Just got to get a foothold in this game to Serbians. See, Brazil started with great intensity. And I've got to say we've done a couple of games, haven't we, so far? But this is a proper atmosphere. You can feel it. Yeah, Senegal, Netherlands and France, Australia didn't quite feel like this one. Brazil nil Serbia nil. Serbia attacking down the right hand side. Brazil back in numbers to defend. Cross comes into their penalty area. Headed away by Casamiro, who is absolutely vital for Brazil. He was the player that was suspended in their quarterfinal defeat against Belgium at the last World Cup. And that was crucial for them on that night. Now, Pavlovic, centre back. High up the field for Serbia. Got caught out. He's desperately trying to win the ball back. He's committed about three fouls there. Two on Pachetar, one on Neymar, who goes tumbling to the ground. And isn't it wonderful, Chris, as well, you talk about Brazil, you talk about World Cups. That is so iconic. That shirt, isn't it? Yellow shirt, green number ten on the back. Tim Vickery telling us as well, you know, the sort of the links and the connections between Neymar, his current age, Pelé, what he did in the World Cup. Neymar's just two goals behind him now as well overall. Yeah, and I know you're a big fan of yellow and green shirts. Chris? Six minutes gone in the first half. So Pavlovic now under pressure. Do you... Yellow card. Do you think... Do you think that was a yellow card? There was a couple of fouls there, but the referee has gone early now, hasn't he? Yes. And if that is the benchmark, then we are going to see a lot of cards. Challenges have gone flying in early on in the game. Both teams hugely motivated. Switzerland and Cameroon, the other two teams in this group. Switzerland beating Cameroon by Goulton Hill earlier on today. The noise levels just dipped for the first time since kickoff. Pachetar looking for a ball down the right for Rafinha. It's over hit. Rafinha doesn't chase it, and it's behind for a goal kick. Rafinha has only come into this Brazilian team quite recently as well. Chris, it was sort of Chi-Chi's scouts who were alerted into Rafinha, and he's very quickly become a really important player for them. What surprised me about that? You were telling me this today. It wasn't that long ago, was it? Start last year. Yeah, I mean, that's pretty amazing, isn't it? Goal kick for Serbia. Goalkeeper, Vanya Malinkovic-Savic waves his three centre-backs up the field. They are all in red. Redshirts, redshirts, redsocks, playing from right to left. Mitrovic nods the ball down. Sergei Malinkovic-Savic on the dribble, just stopped by Marquinhos on the edge of the box. He waxed it away with his right foot. Then Pavlovic takes a whack from Rishalison as they challenge for the ball. Rafinha comes flying as well, really committed to the tackles this evening, and the throw-in actually has gone Brazil's way, and then Rafinha is going to come over and have a little bit of afters with Mladenovic. Yeah, feisty old start to the game, but it should have been a foul on Pavlovic from Rishalison who wasn't actually looking at the ball, jumped into Pavlovic. Eight minutes gone. All someone's had their shirt taken off, it's Neymar. Now Neymar is exaggerating the challenge on him there. Sasa Lukic was sort of tugging him and pulling him, and his shirt started to come off, and then Neymar, ever the showman here on the big stage, just basically took it off and almost said to him, look, you can have this if you want, but maybe after the game. Didn't you say to one of your lads, Christy, we're going to get Neymar's shirt from tonight's game? Yeah, I did. I wasn't quite telling the truth. Eight minutes gone in the first half. Brazil nil, Serbia nil. Lively start to the game, and Serbia are certainly going to play their part. They're a good team, they've qualified for this World Cup brilliantly, finished ahead of Portugal and sent them into the playoffs. I did get my lad of Ronaldinho shirt though. Yeah, well. He was a Barcelona who he asked for mine, Champions League game. Throw in for Serbia on the left. Mladenovic takes it, Gudel slightly misused the pass back to him. Brazil might be away here. Rashalicen lays it off to Rafinha. Rafinha again, stretching those long legs out away. He goes down the right-hand side, curls a low pass into Neymar, just flicks it with the outside of his right boot back to Casamiro. Venetius Jr. support on the outside, but he cuts infield. Casamiro 35 yards out, plays a low slow pass out to the left, gets it back and then starts to think about the cross. Switch pass into Neymar, Neymar on the dribble, inside the box, still going. Serbia eventually get it away from him and clear the ball up towards Mitrovic who heads it down and Mitrovic then chases the next pass, bumps into Thiago Silva but wins the header, Serbia have it, that's Tavic and now Zivkovic playing the ball forward from the right and Serbia just slow things down again. Yeah, it was good from Brazil though, wasn't it wonderful. Pass from Casamiro, really fizzed into Neymar who took a heavy touch and then the chance, the opening was gone. Serbian defenders back in numbers, making it difficult for Neymar to get the shot off. Casamiro just sitting in that quarterback position. Pachetar and Neymar playing higher up in the midfield. Zivkovic again on the right hand side, cross comes in too close to Alisson, that's an easy claim for him on the edge of his six yard box. He's a left footed right wing back. Zivkovic. 10 minutes gone then in the first half, Brazil nil Serbia nil. Just wondering whether Chris Fogotar, gaming Rostov, the Brazil-Switzerland game, they're opening the World Cup because of all the other things that happen there. You got chased by a pack of dogs when you went for a run, you had your haircut, didn't you? Breakfast in that hotel was always a little bit scary. Mitrovic goes down and he's asking for a card, a yellow card I presume as Pachetar is a strong challenge and we talked about the referee setting the standard earlier. It's the foot as well, isn't it? That's where the injury is for Mitrovic and so that's what Serbia will be concerned about. Brazil nil Serbia nil. Do you want to make him angry? Do you poke the bear? 50 goals for his country, Alexander Mitrovic, 50 goals in just 76 international caps which is an astonishing rate of scoring. Lukic plays the ball back to the edge of his own penalty area, central midfielder, Gudel, long hair tied up on the top of his head, trying to get an attacking move going has given the ball away. Here's Thiago Silva, across to Marquinhos, those two obviously have played together plenty of times at international level, plenty of times at club level, at Paris-Sajaman as well. Now the ball with Casamiro in the centre-circle, across to Danilo, forward to Pachetar, just lays it off to Danilo, he's lost it, Tarec tries to take it away, tries to take it around Casamiro, he does his job and stops him, Rafinha picks up the next ball and passes back into his own half and Danilo plays back to Marquinhos. That's Casamiro all over, Tadec looked to drift past him in the centre of the park when the ball was given away by Brazil, but really strong challenge, well-time challenge and Brazil back in possession of the ball, Rafinha and Vinicius Junior staying really wide, Rafinha off that right-hand side, Vinicius Junior off to left, Vinicius Junior right footer, Rafinha, and left footer, they look to come inside and link up. Brazil looks sharp, Serbia looks sharp too, Brazil have it inside the Serbian half, Neymar plays it out wide here to Vinicius Junior, Vinicius Junior uses a bit of skill, beats his man on the outside, still going down by the byline, chased hard, sliding challenge on him and it goes out for a Brazilian corner. Their first of the game, Brazil nil, Serbia nil. It's brilliant wing play, it really, really is. Everybody's talking about Neymar coming into the tournament, but Vinicius Junior is the one to watch for me for Brazil. Drove the outside then, likes to come inside on his right foot, but giving Zivkovic something to think about. Neymar gets ready to take the corner, one, two, three, four, five, six yellow shirts inside that Serbian penalty, he goes for goal Neymar, hits the bar, and the ball goes straight up in the air, keeper I think got a touch, it's going to be another corner. How do you say he went for goal though? He goes for goal from the corner Chris. He goes it in, was it just a bad corner? Let's see what he does with this one, maybe he'll have another go. By the way, Malinkovic Savic, Vanya the goalkeeper is the second-tallest player in the competition, so you do well to lob him from anywhere. Neymar taking the corner from the left with his right foot, and there he is, the big man Malinkovic Savic makes a good clean catch with both hands. One of the Serbian defenders is collided with the post, that's Pavlovic who's on the yellow card. So he's slowly getting himself to his feet. The great line from Cice, the Brazilian boss about Neymar, which I loved in the build-up to the World Cup, Chris. Neymar is both bow and arrow, the creator, but also the finisher. Yeah, well, we'll see. Let's hope he is known for his thriving in this World Cup, not his diving. Malinkovic Savic has the ball in hand, the Serbian goalkeeper, who got a good fist on that Neymar corner, which led to the second corner. Serbian have dealt with that. Pavlovic looking a little shaky at left side, he's just passed the ball straight out of play. Brazil take the throw inside their own half. Ball back with Marquinhos, almost a missed Q pass. Allison does well to keep that in play and save it from going out for a corner. Controlled on the left hand side by Mladenovic, does well, holds off the challenge of Raphinha, plays the ball back into central midfield and here's Sasa Lukic out to the right to Zivkovic, who as Chris says is the left footer playing on the right. You could see again there, he was trying to get into position to try and hit an in-swing cross with the left foot. Serbia come back to the halfway line. Miloš Velkovic is the middle of the three centre backs, who was formerly a Tottenham player, who didn't get too much game time, now plays at Vrda Brejman, here's Pavlovic, who's a hulking great centre back and wears the number two. Gudel, across to Velkovic in the centre circle, to Milenkovic, the right-sided centre back. Brazil forcing Serbia back towards their own goal here and they've had to come back to their keeper, Milenkovic-Savic, who's actually just outside his penalty area, so they'll start to build again. Velkovic to his right, that goes to Milenkovic, back it comes to the goalkeeper, this time he goes with a high first time clearance downfield, Aleksandro leaps to win the header, Milenkovic-Savic, Sergei Milenkovic-Savic wins the next one, he's a tall man in the middle of the park for Serbia, already over 300 appearances for his club Lazio. He's been heavily linked, hasn't he, with Premier League clubs now for a number of seasons. He's the one who really drifts forward with Gudel and Lukic just sitting behind him, trying to make the play. It's a feature of his game which he's very good at, Milenkovic-Savic. Serbia keeping the ball well, they've won a cheap free kick, I would say there. Velkovic has gone down, not saying contender for the simulation game, but he didn't need much contact, little tug of the shirt and down he went. Do you want to have a look at the old Ronaldo penalty today, Chris? Not seen that yet, just seen still images. Portugal beat Ghana by three goals to two. Ronaldo scoring one of those from the penalty spot, first player to score at five separate World Cup tournaments. Joaquinios plays across to Thiago Silva, some fabulous football commentaries on the way for you tomorrow on Five Live in BBC Sound, starting with Wales against Iran from 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that also on BBC Television. So again, via the iPlayer World Cup extra, you can get the pictures, you can get the Five Live commentary, that'll be Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin tomorrow free kick for Brazil just inside the Serbian half. 16 minutes gone, they take it short, Neymar at walking pace, then just sweeps the ball with his right foot to beat one man, header one by Rishalosen, but Brazil can't keep it. Milinkovic-Savic to Gudel, Gudel plays a little one-two, then hits a pass out to the right, pressure on from Neymar, loose ball into the Serbian penalty area, Golkeber gives it a good shot, Milinkovic-Savic gets there in time and actually gets Serbia away down the left here, and Ladenović just rolls it forward for Dusan Tadic, Tadic on the turn, gets away from Pakatar, plays back to Lukic and Serbia again back into their own half. The goalkeeper did well, didn't he? Milinkovic-Savic, the goalkeeper, just at the right time getting there and popping the ball out left. Just trying to get a foothold in this game and make some passes, the Serbians. As I say, the thing they really lack is great pace in this team. Mitrovic very nearly finds Zivkovic with a crossfield ball. Mitrovic gives it the old, how didn't you control that? I mean, he was at full flight and trying to control it in midair. Had he been able to bring it down, he might have been able to get across into the penalty area, throw in for Brazil, left back position, Neymar takes it down well on his chest, tackled, three or four rolls from Neymar, stays down, no free kick given, I don't know where the referee was playing advantage, Venetius Junior is then tackled, so it's whether it's going to be a throw in for Brazil or a free kick for Brazil. He did play an advantage, okay, and it was a foul. But why the, I mean, we can count the rolls here, can't we? That's one, two... They stopped the replay, there were more than that weren't there? Yep. That hurts Chris when you get tackled like that. But, you know, just go down, you don't have to roll over five times. Damn me. Free kick for Brazil. I really hope for his sake as well, you know, he's not known for his diving antics in this World Cup. He's a brilliant player, but that's something which he's always done, but needs to cut out of his game. Third World Cup, for Neymar, four goals for him in 2014, but through injury missed the semi-final, the humiliation at the hands of Germany, knocked out in 2018. And that brilliant quarter-final against Belgium, here they are trying to win a sixth World Cup. Pakatar, edge of the area, pass blocked by Guddel, Malinkovic-Savage tries to bring the ball away, his pass is intercepted, Marquinhos just chases the ball back. So when they're out of possession, they'll shape up as a back five, the Serbians three in the midfield, but when they win the ball back, you know, you talk about that lack of pace, you know, which is so essential to counter-attack. Mitrovic doesn't have the pace, neither does Tadic. Tadic is such a talented footballer, really is a wizard. Great passer, he's a finisher as well. They need that pace. Pakatar looking for Neymar, was trying to let that ball run across his body, that was well read there by Malinkovic, who stepped in to intercept, but Brazil comes straight back out Serbia, Venetius Jr. Has looked really good at the start of this game, lays it off to Neymar, 25 yards out. Mike Fancy this one, Neymar hits the drive, and it's blocked by Velkovic. Rishalosin down. He took the head, Rishalosin. Did he? I thought Velkovic blocked and Rishalosin caught one as he went running in for the rebound, you're right, he's down holding his face. I didn't realise they call him the Pionbo, the pigeon, Rishalosin. Brazilian team-mates, that's something I discovered in the research for the game as well. And why is that? I don't know Chris, he was in very good form though, for the player pronunciation videos, because he stands in front of the camera and he goes, Richie with a big smile on his face. You don't often see him smiling like that, but he's in a good mood here at the World Cup. They're coming forward, Venetius Jr. plays the ball back to Casamiro, 30 yards out. He's going to hit one, and Malinkovic-Savic makes the save, half spills it, but no one there to get on the rebound. Brazil, Nel, Serbia, Nel. Yeah, it's not like Malinkovic-Savic, the Serbian goalkeeper, needed his hands warming on the guitar, but there's a decent strike from Casamiro. 30 yards out, put his laces through the ball, but straight at the goalkeeper. Malinkovic-Savic clears. Now that's something obviously Mitrovic does have, the ability to win that long ball, he nodded it down, Serbia have lost possession. Paketar plays a low pass to Aleksandro. His ball forward down the left of Venetius Jr. doesn't find him, Serbia intercept and a chance now for them possibly to attack through Lukic. Lukic plays to the right, it's picked up by Tadic. Tadic's running forward down the inside right channel, has lost that a little too easily. Here's Tiago Silva. And it's Venetius Jr. really working back very, very well. Picked the ball up again and he's driving. He's in the mood, isn't he? Yeah, look at him go. He's made 30-40 yards up the left, he's then lost it in a tackle on the halfway line, but they're getting the ball well. Rafinha as well, wide to Venetius Jr. and Rafinha, and they are really just going for it. Ball back inside the Serbia in half. Midway through the first half, five live and BBC sounds from the World Cup here in Doha. Brazil nil, Serbia nil, this time tomorrow night you'll be stuck into England's next game in this tournament after the thumping win against Iran. They play the USA tomorrow night, John Murray will be alongside Rob Green and Chris is good pal, Micah Richards part of the commentary team tomorrow night. And then Chris will be taking the calls after the game on 6-06. Neymar with a bit of closing down there, blocks the clearance and the ball goes out for a Serbian throw. We were talking about this earlier, weren't we, about which Brazil will we see, will they sit deep, Tim Vickery says they are going to press high. It's a different type of Brazilian team. If you want to win this World Cup, you've got to work hard out of possession. I think the game has certainly changed, hasn't it? You can't carry players and passengers out of possession. Neymar putting a shift in. High bouncing ball comes over to the left hand side in Serbia's half, Milo Denević pokes a little pass to Malinkovic Savic. Back to Malinkovic, Rafinha is in chasing again trying to win those tackles. Malinkovic Savic tight spot for him, white on the left keeps it in play but loses it to Marquinhos. Rafinha will chase this down the left hand side, Pavlovic gets his body in the way, Rafinha can't quite muscle his way round. And it goes behind for the goal kick. Got slightly lucky, didn't he? Pavlovic, Rafinha nearly, nearly kept that in. Trying to use his body and just ease Rafinha out on the byline. Talking about... Did enough. Did enough, exactly, did enough. He's on the yellow card so he's got to be careful. Serbia played the ball up towards the halfway line. Malinkovic Savic tried to flick it on, didn't get any contact on it. Denević just nods it down inside his own half. Gudel sticks out a lead and pokes it forward but only as far as Thiago Silva, white it comes here to Danilo. Danilo plays back to Marquinhos and Marquinhos with a low pass out to the left back, Alex Sandro. Down that touch line to Venicius Jr. This time, Zivkovic gets close, doesn't allow him to run. So Brazil play back to the two centre backs, Thiago Silva and Marquinhos exchange passes. 25 minutes gone in the first half, Brazil nil, Serbia nil, Alex Sandro down the left to Venicius Jr. Intercepted by Linkovic Savic with a chance to spin and play a little pass to the right-hand side and Serbia coming on the counter here, getting men forward. Mitrovic in the middle will jump for it, Alisson comes out and makes the catch. He does brilliantly, Alisson. His anticipation is exceptional. Cross from the right-hand side and Tadec is looking for Mitrovic at the far post and Mitrovic so good in the air. He stands the ball up and Alisson off his line like a whippet and clutches the ball probably eight yards from his line. Really good anticipation. He's one of the Liverpool players this season who has had a good start to the season. Long-Dagon looking for Rafinha Pavlovic heads it away. Brazil get a throw on the right-hand side. If Serbia do manage to beat Brazil tonight, it will be the first opening game Brazil have lost at a World Cup since 1934. I was going to say that. First two World Cups. Who was that against? They lost their opening game each time against Yugoslavia, funnily enough. And then 1934 against Spain since then, unbeaten in 19 opening games, winning 16 of them. 20 minutes to go in the first half and here's Venetius Jr. of Real Madrid just caressing a pass back to Thiago Silva. Brazilians as ever looking after the football. Danilo back to Marquinhos. First-time ball finds Thiago Silva, controls it, plays it forward to Neymar. Neymar's allowed to turn, looks for a little bit of skill, stopped in his tracks, Tadic on to it for Serbia. He's lost it so Brazil can start again from the halfway line. Pachetar picks up, little spin and a pass from him to Danilo. Danilo bit of space here in the inside right channel. Wide two Rafinha and Rafinha plays back to Marquinhos. Cross to Casamiro a little further forward. Yeah, Alexandra and Danilo, more back supports backing Rafinha and Danisius Jr. up, not really getting on beyond them. Nice, crisp pass from Rafinha, played into Danilo, who's in a central midfield position. Thiago Silva looking for Venetius Jr. of Goldkeeper, quickly off his line, gets both hands to the ball and then races out up to his feet and clears with his right foot. That's top, top goalkeeping, it really is. Brazil take the throw in quickly, Malenkovic in, hard with the challenge on Venetius Jr. Then he gives Neymar a shove, then the referee eventually decides to give the free kick and the Serbians aren't happy about it. Brazil nil Serbia, now that was great goalkeeping. Yeah, but that's when Brazil look at their most dangerous, that's a couple of times now, Venetius Jr. has made that run. There's Thiago Silva with the slide rule pass and Venetius Jr. In off the left-hand side between Wingback and Sente half, Malenkovic, Savage, off his line, really quickly and he throws himself, slides out and gets a big right hand, an enormous right hand on the ball and pushes it away. Free kick for Brazil, level with the edge of the Serbian penalty area, wide on the left-hand side, Neymar could be the one to strike it. In the group game in Russia four and a half years ago, Thiago Silva actually got on the score sheet in the 2-0 win, it was the final group game that time. Neymar's face is reathed in sweat, etched with concentration, could be a curling ball from the left boot of Rafinha as well. Thiago Silva's in there, Rechalison's in there, Marquinhos is in there, taken short, Neymar on the dribble, plays it to Rafinha, down by the byline, over hits the cross, beyond everyone, he was at full stretch and it's gone out for a throw into Serbia on the left. It wasn't a Brazilian-like cross, was it? I think Neymar had a little 2v1 from the free kick on that left-hand side and Neymar had over-weighted the pass to Rafinha, who then tried to stand up across from inside the box, near the byline and must have chipped that all of 40-50 yards, one bounce out for a throw in to Serbia, halfway inside there, half. Almost coming up to the half hour here on 5 live in BBC Sounds, Brazil 0, Serbia 0. Martin Keown is sitting not too far away from us, former England international, working for BBC Television this evening. Chris, you were sort of getting into his ribs before the game, reminding him about a 3-1 blackburn win against Arsenal, but he wasn't taking, he blamed Tony Adams, didn't he? Tony Adams not here to defend himself. Absolutely right, of course. That's what footballers do, Bruce, I've discovered Chris sharing a flat with you. Blame everybody else. Absolutely. Even at a bowl, I cooked you steak last night, you finished up two helping, steak, rice, broccoli and salad, and then you get straight up and you went and had a bowl of cornflakes. Yeah, it wasn't a measly steak, wasn't it? Neymar. Three mouthfuls, that was it. Neymar plays wide to Venetius Jr. In field to Casamiro. Casamiro looking to loft one over the top, Tadich gets in the way and blocks it. The ball is back with Casamiro just inside the Serbian half, goes for a similar pass, Raphinha might get on the end, and he heads it across goal and then headed away and behind for a corner by Velkovic. Yes, we talked about the run from Venetius Jr. off that left-hand side, likes to make that run inside the wing back, the opposite side this time, Raphinha making a run behind the Serbian backline and heading a ball across. Velkovic did really well actually, went the situation well, took no chances, headed it behind. Malimkovic, Savic, being vociferous and forceful inside a six-yard box, corner comes in low to the near post, it was aim for Rishalison, last touch came off Miladenovic, it's gone behind for another corner, Raphinha will take. Venetius Jr. is lurking on the edge of the D, if anything comes out there to try and hit the strike, might go short here to Paccata. Paccata spotted an opportunity, lovely back here to Raphinha, low cross, all nearly connected with at the near post in the end, it's in the arms of the goalkeeper, Malimkovic, Savic, and it was the 38-year-old Tiago Silva sliding in at the near post like a young Chris Sutton. Yes, he's having a good game, isn't he, the Serbian goalkeeper so far, really good handling. Great run here on the right by Zivkovic, now that is a bit embarrassing. He did well initially, he's then lost in, thrown himself to the floor to try and win the free kick, doesn't get the decision. Paccata rolls a pass down the left, that's blocked, goes out for a Brazilian throw. He's holding his mouth. Zivkovic. Come on, he's better than that Chris. Yeah, he is better than that. Sorry to steal the catchphrase, here's Venetius Jr. I think the ball's gone out for a throw in to Brazil on the left-hand side. Come on, Zivkovic, get back in the game here, your team needs you. Brazil nil, Serbia nil. Chris and Robbie back with 6-0-6, as I said, tomorrow night after England, USA, our fourth, four more World Cup commentaries coming your way tomorrow. 10 o'clock, Wales, Iran, 1 o'clock, Qatar against Senegal in Group A, Netherlands, Ecuador, I've not got you for that one. Chris and Matt Upsen for that one, tomorrow at 4 o'clock, England, USA at 7. Five live, your World Cup station coverage of every single game on five live and BBC sounds. 13 minutes remaining in the first, our fascinating tussle here between South America and Europe, and Neymar's trying to be clever with a sort of nutmeg back heel on Tadich, and Tadich isn't having it, Neymar's battling for the ball on the floor, and then Lukic goes sliding in on Alec Sandro, and Alec Sandro gives it a couple of tumbles and the referee says, get up, throw in Brazil. Yeah, Neymar there trying to be a bit of a show pony, the crowd in the stadium enjoying that, trying to not make one of the Serbian midfielders with a back heel, and the Serbians are saying, we're not having that. It's about entertainment though, Chris, I love it. Yeah, well, it's about being effective, Bruce. It is. Brazil with Danilo. It's alright being pretty, you need to punch. Ha ha, fine, back at Alec Sandro to Venetius Junior. Will this be the Brazilian punch? Neymar with a flick, couldn't find Venetius Junior. Cross comes in, that one's headed away by Velkovic, ball bounces midway inside the Serbian half, collected here by Marquinhos, every single outfield player inside the Serbian half to our right at the moment. Neymar picks the ball up in space, first touch actually led him down, then he goes tumbling, Gudel, no foul. Just coming back at the moment though, isn't it? The Serbians cannot get up the pitch. I think Brazil sense it as well, they're pressing forward, Thiago Silva well forward in this attack, Rashalison, lovely layoff to the right, Danilo, crossing to that penalty area, looking for Neymar. Clear, first time, Mitrovic looks for a little layoff, Tadich heads it to his left, Alec Sandro read it well, beats Mitrovic in the air, nods it back into his own arm. The problem is when the ball goes up to Mitrovic, he's isolated, they need to get players in and around him for the knockdowns. Well the two tasked with that, Tadich and Malinkovic Savic who are kind of the two supporters, and then the wing backs, obviously Zivkovic on the right, Ladenovic on the left. Now there's a lovely back heel again to Rashalison, out wide to Rafinha, Rafinha on his left foot, 25 yards out. Packetar, back to Rafinha, weak shot straight at the keeper, what a chance that was for Brazil, and Malinkovic Savic breathes a sire relief. What a pass it is though, back to Rafinha, then it's a really weak finish, takes a brilliant first touch. And then on his favoured left foot, you're expecting the net to bulge. Hands on his head, through the inside of his left foot as well, you could just feed that into the far corner, it gets horribly wrong, I think it comes more or less off his heel, and it just trickles into the Serbian keeper's arms. That was the best chance of the game. Just took the words right at my mouth, that was the best chance of the game so far. Brazil nil, Serbian nil. Was it Packetar with the pass was it? It was a wonderful pass. I can't remember, that was about really wonderful pass a minute ago. Rashalison battling for it here with Pavlovic, Serbia come out on top, Lukic forward to Goudel, nice touch from Tadic edge of the area, once a free kick, doesn't get it. Rafinha with a little touch, Goudel in with the challenge, knocks the ball out of play, Brazilian throw on the right hand side, Brazil have only lost two of 47 competitive internationals under the man in the light blue suit down there, Cice. One against Belgium, World Cup quarter-final, last time around, one against Argentina on home turf in the Maracanara in the Copa America final last year, which really will have hurt. Brazil nil, Serbia nil, talking about light blue suits, there was a fellow doing some television stuff ahead of the game in the most outrageously shocking pink suit at the start of this game. I mean he looked a million dollars, but couldn't see you in that. Chris, pink suit, white trainers, he looked fantastic, lovely rich golden tan as well. Nice ball out to the right hand side for Zivkovich, bit of space to bring it forward for Serbia. Up to the corner of the penalty area, Zivkovich gets the return pass, now the cross comes in towards the far post and Ladinovich attacks it with the header, it's gone well wide, that's a goal kick for Brazil. We're into the last 10 minutes of the first half, Brazil nil, Serbia nil. Better from the Serbians, it was an underlap wasn't it from Zivkovich, putting a good crossing position with his weaker right foot, balloon the cross really to the far post. Balloon, don't you? We've got to cross that off the list now because we've used it. And now this falls for Tadec, 30 yards out central position, lays it off to Zivkovich, Malinkovic-Savic wants to edge of the box, Zivkovich back to Gudel. Nice football from Serbia here, can they pack a punch, can they test Alisson? They find Mitrovic with something meaningful in the middle, Lukic. Just inside the Brazilian half, across to the left side he'd send it back, Pavlovich, thought about rumbling forward there at speed and then stopped in his tracks and played it back to Velkovic, across to Malinkovic into the feet of the central midfielder, Lukic, starts to glide forward, trying to find Zivkovich on that right hand side, Brazil are able to shepherd the ball out of play, but the throw in goes Serbia's way. I haven't really shown that belief, the Serbians in the final third. No. That sharpness of passing. Neymar was questioning that decision there, wasn't he? Almost giving it the, do you know who I am? And the assistant referee was having none of it. Throw in Serbia, Serbia have it inside, their half, Brazil nil, Serbia nil, 5 live and BBC sounds, all the reaction, all the debate, all the analysis after another fascinating day of World Cup football here in Qatar, available for you by the BBC Sounds app on the World Cup Daily podcast. Mitrovic giving Pavlovich a real blaster, he's not happy with that pass, but Mitrovic should have made the run in the channel and given him an option. Kasimiro just inside the Serbian half, Marquinhos comes forward, central position, finds Neymar, looks for the 1-2 with Pachetar, doesn't come off, Brazil get possession again, here's Danilo. Danilo to Neymar, who's got a real joyful bounce to his movement inside this stadium, enjoying the game, enjoying the show, enjoying being the center of attention and trying to take Brazil to the hex, as they call it Brazil, the sixth, the hex, sixth World Cup title. Marquinhos up towards the halfway line, stops dead, plays across to Thiago Silva, going with a giant aerial, it's just TV aerial, it's just walked in front of us, they're not relying on him to provide footage around the world. That looks like one of my old TV set. Marquinhos, Brazil work it to the right, Rafinha, ah nice pass, through the legs of the defender, Pachetar, crossing towards Rashalison, good defending at the near post, prevents Rashalison getting the shot away, Serbia try and turn it into a counter attack, long stride of Malinkovic Savage up towards the halfway line. There you are, Tadic making the forward run, but no great pace, Serbia have been good, the three centre halves, defended crosses very very well, like three dormant, aren't they? Belgrade nightclub. Pavlovic in particular has that look about him, when I saw him close up in the tunnel I thought, four. He looks tough. He's entered the Brazilians, you're not coming in. Janang's not down anymore, he's a rugged, he's the very definition of a rugged centre back. Serbia have got some lovely footballers in this team as well, Gudel, across here to one of those...bouncers. Pavlovic plays back to his goalkeeper, who could be another one actually, Malinkovic Savage, six foot eight inches tall, the only player taller than him at this World Cup we've seen, Andres Noppert, the Dutch goalkeeper. The Dutch debutant, wasn't he? Correct, full wide, played infield to Malinkovic Savage, Gudel's just made a nice little run forward into space, collects it just outside the Brazilian area, lost it to Paketar, Thiago Silva, passed up through the middle to Kasimiro, quick ball over the top, Vinicius Junior is chasing that bouncing ball, all stretched there from Malinkovic, didn't get it. Vinicius Junior has missed, and it goes behind for a goal kick, hits it with his right foot on the half folly, he claims he should have had at least a corner, doesn't get the decision, and Malinkovic, who sort of, his clearance I think, hit himself in the face, very nearly gave Vinicius Junior the chance, oops. It's a good shout that, Malinkovic, it was a long diagonal ball, I think it was Kasimiro, wasn't it? And as the ball bounces, Malinkovic gets there first, is outstretched, right leg trying to hook the ball back over his shoulder, and all it does, it falls into the path of Vinicius Junior, but credit Malinkovic, he gets back and makes the block, it should have been a Brazilian corner. So I think he made the block and then Vinicius Junior got another touch, Cross comes in towards Mitrovic just over his head, but I think Zivkovic might be able to keep this in, if he can run at the speed of light, he got nowhere near it, that's gone out for a throw. No, but nearly, missed it at the base. Nearly, for Serbia is Mitrovic catches Thiago Silva, it's a diagonal ball, ball well, ball whipped in from the left hand side and just over Mitrovic's head, his movement is very, very good, peels away from Thiago Silva, tries to get out of his eye line, the cross comes in. Ah, Neymar's down by the byline, got to shove in the back, he'll take that all day long. Silly challenge really, because he was under pressure there, deep in his own left back position, just waited for the contact from Zivkovic and wins the free kick, three minutes remaining in the first half, can't see too much added time coming on at the end of the first half, but you know, what's too much at this world cup? I know, Brazil nil. Are we going to see another nil nil? Serbia nil nils. I've not added them all up, but there was Uruguay South Korea today, which said on the BBC Sport website, very entertaining nil, you can have entertaining nil nils Chris. Danilo, all pass forward on the volley intercepted by Goodell, Danilo gets another chance, thumps it away, high in the sky, head forward by Milenkovic, passes knocked out to the left, intercepted by Pakatar, Pakatar to Kasimiro, on to Neymar, Neymar nods it down, keeps control, chased by a whole horde of red-shirted Serbs, and is able to hold them off and find Raphinha. Raphinha with a bit of skill on the right, and then just let the ball get away from him, goes behind for a goal kick. He thought about hitting the cross and decided to go for one more cut back, couldn't control it. Yeah, it was really clever the way he manoeuvred the ball at first, shapes to go inside on his left foot, drags it on the outside of Pavlovic, but just overran it. You could see Neymar close attention, drifts past four Serbians in the middle of the park, and popped the ball out to that right-hand side. 75 goals for the Celasau, Neymar, Pele on 77, will this World Cup be the time when Neymar gets there and possibly goes past? It's always your read of it, the other night. Talk of this being his last World Cup, it's now or never really, for him, isn't it? Well, I was thinking that going into this one, Chris, because Ciccio has said that, Tiago Silva will be the same for him, and the amount of players that are on the last dance here, honestly, that dance floor is absolutely rammed. Ronaldo, Messi, possibly Lewandowski, it'd be difficult to find room out there. Brazil have given the ball away, Tadich, nice little drag, keeps the ball under the studs of his left boot. Why? To Zivkovic, back to... Got a few bodies in the box here. Tadich was off balance, couldn't control it, Allison picks it up, we've got a minute left of normal time in the first half. Very enjoyable game of football, we hope you're enjoying it with us wherever you are. On five live in BBC Sounds, Neymar's on the move through that Serbia midfield, can't find Raphinha with the pass. Serbia have cleared the danger for now, Brazil will go again with Danilo. Danilo to Casamiro, across to Paccatá, Paccatá to Alexandro, little layoff from Neymar, this time just decides to give it straight away and move off into space, back it comes to Casamiro. Midway inside the Serbian half, Raphinha, lovely bit of skill, little shirt tug on him, not bothered, shrugs off the defender, plays the ball across to the left. One minute of added time, I can't believe it. Alexandro, wide to Venetius Jr. Venetius Jr. Oh, very nearly slipped one through to Neymar. Brilliant from Goudal, just making the interception. I think it's really interesting the way Brazil are playing and they're looking for, in those wide areas, Raphinha, or Venetius Jr. in those duels to create something, produce a bit of magic, they're not the marauding Brazil, the overlaps which we've seen in the past. That is the difference, isn't it, Chris? And we were talking about this with Tim Vickery about the likes of Cafu and Roberto Carlos and Carlos Apilote. Who would just fly as would get on, get crosses in, shots in. Yeah, these full backs in this iteration of the Brazil team. They're going on a bit, but that's no excuse. But as I said earlier, they're more back support, supporting the play, playing behind them. Danilo is one of them, plays the ball across to Thiago Silva. Ten seconds remaining in this first half, looks like we're going to go in goal-less. Alexandro has the ball wide on the left, Brazil have had lots and lots of possession. Referee decides that is it for the first half, blows his whistle. And it's goal-less. Chris, best chance of the game fell to Raphinha, it was brilliantly worked. He just didn't apply the finish, but Serbia have shown as we knew, they've got enough to challenge Brazil here. Yeah, they've said before the game, this is a street-wise Serbian team. I think the three centre-halves have been absolutely brilliant, I've described them as three Belgradean doorman. And they've been pretty watertight. That one opportunity, the chance of the half, Raphinha showed a real lack of conviction. But that's been it for Brazil, they've got to show more in this second half. I'm sure that Cice, I mean, he'll be looking at his bench and thinking, are there enough players on my bench? And I think there are who can change this game, because it hasn't happened at this moment in time. For Serbia, they've really struggled to get up the pitch, they've lacked pace, Mitrovic and Tadicch aren't speed merchants. But I think they'll go in at halftime, if this is the game plan, we're going to keep things nice and tight. We're going to try and counter or maybe pinch a goal off a set piece or whatever. I think it's gone OK for them. So Kelly, to extend that rather torturous analogy, the doorman doing a great job at the last dance. Brazil can't get onto the dance floor, Brazil nil Serbia nil. You're obsessed with the dance floor tonight, somebody's going to have to take Alex Bruce Ball out dancing. I think it might have to be you, Chris Sutton. Tim Vickery is with us this evening as well. And we'll be back to the sales stadium with Ali and with Chris very shortly for the second half of that game. Tim, it feels as though Brazil are warming up into this World Cup, but the potential that's there for them to have a lot of fun on the pitch is there. Yes, although I think there's been a lack of midfield elaboration. You know, I don't think the coach is entirely convinced by what they're doing. I spent a couple of hours with him just a few weeks ago and they have a it's called a technical commission. It's a group. It's the coach and all of his assistants. And they were remarkably open about this dilemma that they had. Who to leave out? Should you leave out Fred or should you leave out? Venetius Junior, they've gone with the ultra attacking. I actually don't. I really don't think the coach believes in this 100%. I think he has doubts about this. I think he's given the majority of being against him. So he's gone along with it. Yesterday, I was intrigued by something he said in the press conference. He said, you win and lose games in midfield. And I wonder if that's a message to his colleagues on his coaching staff as much as anyone else, because I think that there's a lack of elaboration. As you saw at the first half hour, Paquita and Neymar are too far apart. They had a little reorganization and they moved it from a 4-3-3 to a 4-2-1-3. Paquita over to the other side of the field, they're left closer to Neymar to try and have more elaboration. But I get the impression that the coach is he selected a side. Now it's the first game. So you've got some margin for error. But he's selected a side in which there are members of his coaching staff who believe in this lineup more than he does. And there are coaches who've done this before. They've called players into squads, they've started players maybe in friendlies. And this is the opening match of the World Cup. There's a step up from that, but it's still, as you say, the opening match of the tournament for Brazil. And they do it sometimes to make a point to say, look, I've tried what you've told me. I've told you it doesn't work and now you can see for yourself it doesn't work. It might well be that there's going to be changes in the second half and it could be different for the rest of the tournament going forward. Yes. Originally, you know, the coach was against the idea of a centre forward. He wanted to play with two open-wingers and Neymar is a false nine. And he was out-voted on that one. The problem that they've had is a problem getting Rich Arleson into the game. That's been much easier for them in the easier games. In this game, where those dormant have been standing outside saying your name's not on the list, you can't get in. It's been much harder for them to get Rich Arleson into the game. So now Gabriel Jezus is a player who offers more in terms of elaboration than Rich Arleson does. Rich Arleson is there as a penalty area specialist to do nothing else, but to look at the goal like a racehorse with blinkers and bang. They know that's what he is, that's what he does. But they haven't been able to get him in the game. If you're looking for more elaboration, well, Gabriel Jezus hasn't really been in the picture recently, but he is a centre forward who gives you a little bit more, an extra man in the circuit of passing on the edge of the area. That's one possible change. The World Cup, you know, it's like time speeded up, isn't it? Sides can suddenly come together or they can suddenly fall apart. And if Brazil go all the way, I doubt that the 11th that start the competition will be the 11th that finish it. And we need to remember, Tim, that the build up to this has been quite disruptive for Brazil. Well, it's certainly been disruptive in part. Or patchy rather, yeah. Yeah, it's been disruptive in or patchy in political terms. I think the coach hated the idea that Neymar came out until he would dedicate the first goal he scored in a competition to Bolsonaro. And how can the team then say that football and politics don't mix? You know, the star player there is making a point of mixing them. But the idea is to isolate the team from all of that. And the main thing is to put that sixth star on the shirt, as Neymar already did on his shorts and got accused of arrogance by the German press. But if you're going to put a sixth star on, you've got to have five first. And Brazil have that five first. I think that gives them every right to be arrogant. Absolutely. There is a Manchester United fan saying not arrogant, just better. And Brazil are just successful at the World Cup. They do have those five stars they're looking for a sixth. Finally, a bit difficult to get through past Serbia in the first half this evening at the La Salle Stadium. Thank you very much to Tim Vickery for now. We'll be back there for second half commentary very shortly as that gets underway. But it's goal is between Brazil and Serbia a half time in this game. We're going to look back on Portugal's game against Ghana earlier on after the BBC News with Richard Foster. Take the World Cup with you. Catard 2022. On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live. A child safe guarding board has apologised for failures in the case of a five-year-old boy murdered by relatives in Bridgend. The review into Logan Wangi's death found hospital doctors failed to report injuries he suffered months before he died, including a broken arm. A man has been charged with the murder of a woman and two children after a fire at their flat in Nottingham. Fatumata Hadara and her daughters Fatima and Naima all died from smoke inhalation. Jamie Barrow, who's 31, is due in court tomorrow. A child thought to be six years old has died and another has been taken to hospital after a bacteria outbreak at a primary school in Surrey. It's believed both children caught an infection on Tuesday. All pupils and staff there have been given antibiotics. A Metropolitan Police officer previously accused of 44 sex offences has now been charged with another nine against one person. David Carrick, who's 47, faces 53 charges against 13 complainants. And half a million more people came to the UK than left in the year to June, the highest number on record. The Office for National Statistics says it's probably down to more students arriving and refugees coming over from Afghanistan and Ukraine. For seven decades, thousands of songs have soundtracked the lives of generations of old people. But there's only ever been one official countdown marking the 70th birthday of the UK's official singles chart. We're playing the most streamed number one from 1952 to 2022. That's seven playlists bursting with hits compiled by the official charts company exclusively for BBC Sounds. The UK's official most streamed songs to listen, open BBC Sounds, tap music and play most streamed songs. BBC Five Live, the FIFA World Cup, Qatar 2022 with Kelly Capes. And we'll be back to the Lissalle Stadium very shortly for the second half of Brazil against Serbia. As Brazil get their World Cup campaign underway, they've got five stars on their shirt. They're looking for a sixth at the moment. It's goalless between Brazil and Serbia. Earlier today Portugal started off their World Cup campaign with a 3-2 win over Ghana. Let's remind ourselves of the goals and we'll start with a penalty from the star man for Portugal. He's looking towards his left. He now begins a stuttering run-up. Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't miss. Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't miss. He runs away. There is the trademark celebration. The boom echoes around. Stadium 9-7-4. This is with Géal Felix. What a finish that was from Géal Felix. Géal Felix with a composed finish. Clips it past the goalkeeper. And Portugal are back in front. Bruno Fernandez and the ball comes in. And Portugal just back to another one. Portugal to Rafael Leal. First time finish right footed. Guides the ball into that far right hand side to score his first goal for his country. So it was nervy at the end for Portugal. Ghana with a really good chance to try and win it after an error from Costa in the Portugal goal. Bernardo Silva summed it up. Very happy. Difficult game as we expected. Two different halves. First one we controlled better the game in terms of the possession. Maybe we were integrative enough. Second half we scored the first one. Then when we conceded the goal the game started being a bit weird in terms of before it was like a more controlled game and then it started like a transition game for both teams which ended up being a good thing for us. Because with our trackers running we scored two goals away. But yeah happy. At the end... A little bit closer than it should have been. Is that fair to say? At the end it was a bit difficult for us especially outside. I was very nervous but three points and a very good way to start this competition. Just whilst this World Cup has been like everything going on but just as the tournament the first week you glad you got the game out of the way and now you just concentrate on the football because you're going to be one of the favourites aren't you? Well I hope so. Not one of the favourites but one of the teams that have a lot of ambition to go far and to try and win it. Yeah very good to start well with the win. Very happy to get the three points knowing that sometimes you get surprised in these competitions. Like we saw with some teams in those first games. That was Bernardo Silva with George Cummings and of course it was all about the team performers but Ronaldo making headlines once again. He got the opening goal in the game from the penalty spot and he's become the first man to score at five World Cups. He scored at Germany in 2006, in South Africa 2010, Brazil 2014, Russia 2018 and now at Qatar 2022. Only four players have scored in four World Cups which was his previous record. Pele did it, Uves Seyla did it, Miraslav Klozer did it and Lionel Messi of course with four. He missed out on South Africa in 2010. He has been in the headlines for off-field stuff in recent weeks but Ruben Neves paid tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo after the match. It's Cristiano, everyone knows him, he's the best player in the world. He's really motivated, like he said on his interview as well. Two days ago I think. He's really motivated, he's really focused on the national team and we are very lucky to have him with us because he still can help us a lot. That was Ruben Neves on Cristiano Ronaldo and on Sports Extra right now. You can listen to the action from the women's Super League. It's Reading 1, Liverpool 1 at half time. Just taking another step away from the World Cup. There's a new episode of the Rugby Union Weekly. It previews the final weekend of autumn matches. It's available now and for a taster, the team chatted to Eddie Jones about his team selection. The concept of the bomb squad is definitely something we want to experiment with. Can we bring a more powerful front row on in the second half? You look at the guys, we've got Gengelut, Koundicki and Will Stewart. That's a powerful front row and whether they can really add to the game in the second half. The second thing, obviously the spring box bring on their best scrimmaging front row in the second half. I remember that is Rugby Union Weekly and it is back and available via BBC Sounds. That of course is where you can get the World Cup daily as well while we wrap up. Everything to do with the World Cup and you can get that as it suggests every morning in your inbox for the journey into work. At the moment we're focusing on Brazil against Serbia from the Lusail Stadium. It's goal is a half time. We will be back there very shortly for the second half. Tomorrow is a huge day for the home nations. It's topped and tailed by Wales and England. 10 o'clock in the morning for Wales against Iran. This is a game that Wales realistically have to win. There's been a big event in Doha here today trying to create support for the Catar National side. They're up against Senegal tomorrow. That's one o'clock for commentary here on Five Live Sport. Four o'clock for Ecuador against Netherlands and then it's seven o'clock. It's England against USA. Five Live Breakfast gets underway at six o'clock in the mornings. Rick will be there live from Doha building up to kick off and of course joined by Rachel in Salford. Rick's going to be speaking to Ian Rush to Rob Green and he's going to be speaking to fans who've had all kinds of journeys to try and get to Catar to watch their teams in action. About to get underway at the stadium in Lusail. It's Brazil against Serbia. It's goal is as it goes into that second half. Tim Vickery is with us just to give us his thoughts. Tim, you talked about the possible changes that Brazil could make going into this one. Just to try and get them to click, to try and get them a bit more productive, to try and get the ball to Rashalison. Yeah, well, one of the problems, if you start off with an ultra attacking line up, how do you make it more attacking without just changing like for like? So there's a couple that they could bring on that might give them something different. One, as I said, would be Gabriel Jezous who would give them more elaboration. The other would be Rodrigo of Real Madrid, who they really see as the future of the Brazilian national team and that they see him as someone capable of operating all across the attacking line. But someone, if you're going to bring someone on, someone's going to come off. I wonder who that someone might be. It may even be Rashalison because if they can't get him into the game, why not try it with something else? But all along, I thought that they would be better inclined to start off with more balance and then expand as the game goes on instead of beginning playing all of your cards at the start and then what you do from then on. I wonder if this will be the starting line up for the next game against Switzerland and I doubt it. Tim Vickery for now. Thank you very much. We can head back to the Lusail Stadium now. Second half commentary of Brazil against Serbia, no goals as yet. For Chris Sutton and Alastair Bruce Ball. Thank you, Kelly. We are just waiting for one man to arrive before we can get the second half underway. Serbia have been out on the field for a couple of minutes. The Brazilian players have slowly made their way out as a team, but the number 10 Neymar wasn't quite ready. Last man out of the tunnel with his Brazilian shirt off, he had to get that on over an undershirt. There was a bit of strapping to be done. He's still doing his bootlaces out on the field and the second half is underway. It's ridiculous. It's taking a while to do his laces up as well, isn't it? What's he doing? No, it's all very odd. I think it's been fascinating the first half though and it's a really interesting group, isn't it? But Switzerland winning today and Brazil playing them next. I mean, Brazil will want to win this one and just take a little bit of pressure off. Second half underway. Goudel has lost it here. Brazil have a chance and they cannot stick it away. Rafainha, one on one with the goalkeeper Malinkovic Savic. Serbia gave the ball away. Rafainha was in. He's had two great chances in the game and he's not been able to take either. Yeah, Goudel on the edge of his own box, just dithering, taking too long to get the ball out of his feet and pop off a pass. Rafainha, 1v1, big save again Malinkovic Savic standing big, making a massive save. But Brazil going to root those two Rafainha misses. Two enormous chances and not taking them. Brazil then playing this second half from right to left as we look at it at the Lusail Stadium. Yellow shirts, green numbers on the back, blue shorts, white socks. He could have gone round the goalkeeper, I think. He could have done anything with it. Just tried to slide it. Really sloppy start at the back for Serbia there. They've survived it. Brazil nil Serbia nil and the point Chris makes is a really good one because of that Switzerland win. Brazil play Switzerland next, that'll be a five live commentary on Monday, 4pm kickoff UK time. If they don't get the win here, same for Serbia as well. It just ranks, cranks up the pressure, that little bit more on that next fixture. Balls fall into Rashalison's feet just inside the Serbian half. He's pretty much on his own support now coming up on his left hand side and he goes down. He doesn't get the free kick. He's dived, hasn't he? There wasn't any contact there. A poor first half in fairness. He didn't get a lot of service in that first half. That's something for Gice to think about. Brazil nil Serbia nil, Alisson in goal for Brazil, Danilo Marquinhos, Thiago Silva and Alec Sandro back four. Casamiro, Lucas Paquetar, Neymar, wide men Raphinha and Venetius Jr. and Rashalison, Tottenham's Rashalison playing through the middle. He's been in good goal scoring form for his country in the warm up games in September. Two against Ghana, one against Tunisia. Brazil haven't been able to find a way through yet this evening. Can Neymar unlock the door? Plays the ball to his right hand side. Danilo to Paquetar on the turn tries to get it back to Neymar. Serbia have dealt with it for now. Tadic forward to Mitrovic. Mitrovic playing a little bit of keep-up. Does brilliantly. Volley's a pass to his right. Lovely pace on that as well to Zivkovic, the right wing back. Zivkovic up against Alec Sandro. Alec Sandro bumps into him. Serbia keep going. Lukic is stopped, wants a free kick, not going to get it. This is danger for Serbia. Now Neymar's on the ball, heading towards their penalty. Goodell, that's a terrible tackle on Neymar just outside the box. Neymar is down, writhing in agony. He made the challenge from Serbia's point of view just in time, because it was short of the area and not in the area, but it was desperation and it was dirty. Yep, it was. It was really cynical. It was because Serbia were careless. On that right hand side gave the ball away and they became stretched. And the manager will say, you know what, it's a really good foul for our team, but dangerous situation now. 20 yards out, left hand side of the box. Just watching this Raphinha chance again. Blimey. I mean, it's such a poor effort it is. As I said, he could have gone round the goalkeeper. He's got the whole goal there, hasn't he? Absolutely. Just lifted over him. Yeah, Malinkovic Savage was already on his way down. I mean, that was a really poor miss. Yeah, just on Goodell, who's made the challenge there, it was him actually that gave that ball away that led to that chance. So possibly a little bit rattled, although, as we were saying, he felt he's made the right decision for his team. Now Neymar, having taken the tumble, has got blades of grass plastered all over his face. We've got a close-up on him. Serbia have a man down, Zivkovic is the draft excluder behind a very tall four-man wall all in red. Free kick just outside the box. Could be Neymar, could be Raphinha. My money's on Neymar. Let's see what Brazil can do with it. Brazil, Nel. Serbia, Nel. Referee just wants to get everything just so. Blows his whistle now. Neymar pauses, drinks in the moment. Then with the right foot, takes a deflection off the wall and over the bar it goes. I think the size of the wall, I mean, it's a tall wall, isn't it? And they're on the tiptoes, got the draft excluder. Very difficult to get it up and down. Maybe the tallest wall ever there. Corner for Brazil. Brazil, Nel, Serbia, Nel. Five live and BBC sounds. Neymar takes it with his right foot. Thiago Silva with the header. Rishalison with the shot. That's blocked. Serbia get bodies in the way. Down by the byline, Neymar tries to get a cross. In Serbia, player down at the moment, inside the penalty area. Referee, let's play continue. And then it goes out of play for a Brazilian throw on the left and then he's happy to stop the game. It's Mlindgevic Savic. It's a ball fist in. Thiago Silva makes a run in that near post area and flicks the ball into... Mlindgevic Savic's face. The Serbian midfielder. Hit the throat, didn't it? He goes down, yeah. Yeah, nasty one actually. Throw in Brazil when we get started again on the left. Serbian team. Goalkeepers made a really important block at the start of the second half. He's another Mlindgevic Savic. He's the younger brother, Vanya. Three centre-backs, Mlindgevic, Velkovic and Pavlovic. Zivkovic, Mladenovic the two wingbacks. Lukic and Guddel the two central midfielders and then Sergei Mlindgevic Savic and Tadic in support of Alexander Mitrovic. And I'm sure at some point we will get to see Fjörantina's Lukajovic and Yaventic's Dusan Vlajevic because Serbia really do have strength up front. And as we mentioned at the start of the night, Filip Kostic is not involved this evening as well, who's a crucial player for them. So that's a miss as well. Throw in Serbia, long diagonal end at Veniceus Junior. He just fell over, bumped into Zivkovic. But no foul. Throw in Serbia, six minutes gone in the second half. Nil-nil and just waiting for that game to rediscover its rhythm. And that real edge it had actually at the start of the game as well. Pakatar to Rishalos, back to Pakatar, slides the chance in here for Rafinha Gratacla and Rafinha. Pavlovic had to get that right on the yellow card, timed it well and got the ball. Yeah, perfect Pavlovic. Really exceptional from him. Because it looked like Rafinha was going to get a shot off with his right foot inside the box. And he gambled, he had to gamble. And he lunged and got the ball. Pakatar's taken a real whack to his lower back here. He was doing some fancy sort of back heel stuff to keep the ball away from Guddel. And Milinkovic Savic. And I'm not quite sure what's happened, but as he made the turn, he's hurt himself. And he's now sort of moving a little bit sorely back into defensive position, Serbian throw on the left. The issue that Serbia have is, you've got to say, they've been pretty powder puff going forward, haven't they? They don't look like causing the Brazilians a problem. Thiago Silva did really well there. Strong against Tadich, brings the ball out from his own half. Vinicius Juni with pace, gets away down the left hand side, still going to the byline. Zivkovic catches up with him. Vinicius Juni keeps his balance, cross comes into the far post, headed away. Volley by Danilo, miscubed Guddel, stoopes and heads the ball out of the Serbian penalty area. Now Zivkovic fancies a chance at running down the right. Thiago Silva gets his body in the way, wins it for Brazil. Quickly forward to Pachetar and suddenly the game has gone up a notch or two. Thiago Silva, ball at his feet, just inside the Serbian half. Pachetar moving fluently again. It was Pavlovic again, wasn't it, with the headed clearance, hooked early. It was an outstanding game, but can they keep the concentration? Neymar looking for the one to Rishalison, ball just ahead of Neymar. It is cleared away by Velkovic, the middle of those three centre-backs. That's the issue, isn't it, for the Serbians. They have been brilliant defensively. But you only have to switch off for a second with the array of stars, the superstars in this Brazilian team. And they'll make them pay. Look at that bench as well, Tim Dikarou, who's mentioning it half-time. Gabriel J. Zuz, Manchester United's Anthony, Real Madrid's Rodrigo, Pedro Flamengo, Gabriel, Martin Eli. On that bench as well. Brazil with Neymar, tickles run round the corner, can't find Pachetar. Clear to Casamiro, played across here to Alex Sandro. Central position, brings it forward, just outside the area, plays it wide to Venetius Jr. low ball in. And the shot is wide from Neymar. Brazil held its breath for a second there, he caught it sweetly, couldn't get it on target. Still 0-0. Yes, a really clever pass from Venetius Jr. as the ball pops out to him on that left-hand side, gets his head up. And he just feeds the ball in right-footed to Neymar. He's leaning back, not great technique, and spoons the ball over the bar with it. His left foot. Ten minutes gone in the second half. And the issue is for Serbia, can they hold out? They've offered absolutely nothing in this second half going forward. You think it's going to be a matter of time? The Brazilians, they will create something. I think those two Rafainha opportunities, I haven't taken those chances, they will eventually. I think Serbia have got to show more intent. Pulling towards Mitrovic, he's deflected into the path of Alisson, that's the first thing he's had to do, he's got a brilliant goalkeeper and he just very calmly bends down and picks the ball up like he's playing in the park with his kids and rolls it out to Marquinhos. Marquinhos plays it to Thiago Silva, who dauntily comes striding up towards the halfway line, gets the ball back here from Danilo, forward to Neymar. Neymar, ten yards inside the Serbian half and then Lukic just muscles him off the ball, concedes the free kick. Another little tchuche quote, I love tchuche's quote, I'm going to hit you with, which I read ahead of the tournament. I think in an interview with Tim Vickery, he said one of the things he learnt from Russia 2018, other teams no longer tremble against the yellow shirt. He said that sort of fear factor that playing against Brazil has. Now we're going to have an early double change for Serbia in the second half. We've got Ivan Ilich coming on for Goodell, who was on the yellow card in central midfield. Ivan Ilich, who was once off Manchester City, they feel he could be a potential Nemanja Matić, actually tall left-footed central midfielder, so he's on wearing number 24. And then the other change sees Nemanja Radonjevich come on for Zivkovich at right wing back. And the ball is in the arms of the goalkeeper, Vanya Malinkovic-Savic, all in green for Serbia. Still nil, Serbia nil. So number seven, wide on the right, Nemanja Radonjevich, who plays for Torino. And here's Mitrovic just volleying a little ball forward. Now Mitrovic might be able to get on the end of something here. The ball bounces high inside the Brazilian half. He bumps Tiago Silva off it, doosan Tadec looks up, gets across into the far post and it's headed away by Aleksandro and Radonjevich was waiting behind him, having just come onto the field and was thinking he might have a chance to score. Good defending though from Aleksandro. He worked the situation first time in this half that Serbia have gotten themselves up the pitch. You can hear the roar from the Serbian fans, Mitrovic, their own shoulder to shoulder with the Brazilian defender. Winning the ball, popping out left and the ball just stood up at the far post and Sandro heads behind. This is where they could be dangerous to Serbian's big team. As we said, Brazil not lost an opening game in a World Cup since 1934 against Spain. At the moment, Brazil nil Serbia nil. 5 live in BBC Sounds. Corner for Serbia, comes in from the right into the near post, headed up in the air. The ball is still in the Brazilian penalty area. Serbia trying to keep it alive with Mitrovic, headed away, chased out by Mladenovic and he'll let the ball go out for a throw in on the left hand side. Level with the edge of the Brazil box and Mladenovic there's no one making any sort of run towards him whatsoever. Eventually, Ivan Ilic, 21 year old decides to do that. Nice little pass first time with his left foot. Malinkovic-Savic tries to find him again. Ball bounces off a couple of Brazilian players. Last touch though, came off Malinkovic-Savic, goes behind for a goal kick to Brazil. Couple of substitutions for Serbia. One of the changes, going to come for Brazil. Pull forward to Neymar. Neymar immediately surrounded by four red shirts, but moves away from them, they're happy to let him have the ball there in the centre circle. Then Tadich has a little nip on, got nowhere near the ball, brings him down. Neymar takes the tumble and that will be a free kick to Brazil. Tadich and Neymar have a little exchange. Brazil already on the move, Casamiro's pass looking for Raphinha down the right. Doesn't get there, second chance for Brazil. Lovely skill from Danilo, uses Raphinha, who's wide. Ball just jumps up off Raphinha's left boot, but he keeps it. Pass goes past Pequeta, finds Alexandro, hits a wicked swerving shot, comes back off the post. Ball on the right here for Brazil. Danilo gets the cross in, it's a deep one, it eventually arrives at Venetius Jr. Earlier with his right foot not on target, goal kick for Serbia. What a hit from Alexandro, Malinkovic Savic was not saving that. You've got to ask yourself, is this going to be one of those nights for Brazil? It's a brilliant strike, all of 30 yards out, Alexandro. And he cuts across the ball, there's all sorts of swerve on the ball, and it cannons off the post. Malinkovic Savic, a big guy in that Serbian goal, gets nowhere near it, goes to safety. Chris is up with us in the Lusail stadium, Chris has picked up hundreds of followers from Japan on social media this afternoon. Chris has gone viral over there doing his interviews with Japanese television today as Raphinha chases a ball through from Rishalison, but can't catch it, Malinkovic Savic bowls it out, the goalkeeper and the ball is with Ilic in midfield. So the Japanese are very excited about the BBC Sport pundit who predicted their win over Germany, their 2-1 win. So Chris did his interview today, you never know what that could lead to, Chris, honestly. Well, I'm available for contract offers. Can I come? It's amazing country to travel around, if you've never been, honestly, it is absolutely wonderful in the past very nearly, the past back to Malinkovic Savic. Because Rishalison was lurking, wasn't he? Here's Marquinhos, Brazil just in the last couple of minutes have just stepped it up a little bit. Bit more pace and purpose about the passing, Casamiro, curling ball with his right foot, Danilo controls, Raphinha is wide on the right, Danilo makes a run beyond him, Raphinha comes back towards the halfway line, he's got that sort of wiry skinny build, hits the pass with his left foot back to Thiago Silva. Marquinhos at all, one-two with Alex Sandro, just seen that shot come crashing back off the post, Venetius Jr. brings it in from the left, nice pass to Casamiro, Casamiro delays his ball, yellow shirts to his right, rolls it across here to Danilo, Raphinha there on the corner of the Serbian penalty area, makes space, left footed ball, nice. To Neymar, Neymar's first touch, lets him down and the ball gets away from him, Serbia clear, here come Brazil again. Ball with Casamiro, central position, 40 yards out, Neymar lets it run across his body, this could be dangerous, silky moves, Neymar into the box, onto his left foot, Venetius Jr. great save and the rebound's knocked in, the offside flag stays down and Rishalison starts the Brazilian party at Qatar 2022, he is absolutely mugged by his teammates, fellow Brazilian substitutes, they're doing a little dance around him and Brazil finally get the breakthrough, some magic skills from Neymar, a brilliant save from Malinkovic Savic initially, but Rishalison there to stick it on to make it Brazil 1, Serbian ill. Rishalison right place, right time but this is all about Neymar and the way he lets the ball run across his body on the edge of the box is absolutely brilliant it is. The ball's just fed into him from Casamiro, drops his shoulder, lets the ball run across his body and runs out on the left hand side of the box. I think he's trying to go himself but inadvertently sets the ball up for Venetius Jr. who whips a shot in right foot and the goalkeeper makes a brilliant save, left handed save, all he does is pokes it out to Rishalison who bundles the ball in, hasn't been involved much this evening, but how important is that proactive inside the box and the Brazilians deserve it, you felt it was coming. Just noticed didn't you Chris, last few minutes that intensity just picked up. With Serbia they've shown little ambition. Radonnić trying to get away down the right, battling for the ball here, Brazil have two players there, Thiago Silva is one of them, Brazil leading Serbia now by a goal to Nilo Mishalison's goal scorer in record, they have really found a consistent number 9 for them, his 18th goal now in 39 internationals, Dusan Tadec is down holding his head, Yellow card goes up for Sasa Lukic, not entirely sure what for, play will stop, Tadec holding the back of his head in his neck, took a heavy tumble, referee Ali Reza Fagani, definitely raised the yellow card to Sasa Lukic, so whether he had a word there or something said something at a turn, maybe that's the reason, Tadec will have to recover and Serbia now, yeah he is, he's having a pop up the ref isn't he? Yep, it's good descent, maybe a foul on Dusan Tadec beforehand and that's where the frustration was. I mean it's okay setting up this way and being defensive, being compact and for you know the best part of 60 minutes, 62, 63 minutes, it's worked for Serbia but they haven't looked like scoring, can't remember Alisson having a save to make, they haven't shown enough intent and ambition and if you want to defend deep that's fine but are you good enough to keep these superstars out and they haven't been and now the game plan has to change for Serbia? Yes, Sasa Lukic has just been booked, he is coming off, Darko Lazovic comes on to replace him and the left wing back, and then Philip Mladenovic, managed to say that right all night and then he comes off the field and I stuff it up and Dusan Vlivic, so that is a change, you've got two strikers on the field now and Serbia have got to go for it a little bit more, we have played 20 minutes in this second half, Rishalison has scored Brazil's first goal at this World Cup and that's sort of carnival feel and noise and music and dancing and there was a sort of organised dance by the Brazilian entire squad really to celebrate Rishalison's goal after it came, and then a big action debate analysis to today's World Cup action in the World Cup Daily podcast on the BBC Sounds app for you, much later on this evening and of course first thing tomorrow morning, so get yourself to the BBC Sounds app and click subscribe and obviously you can always listen to the games if you're on the move during this World Cup at any time on your device, take us with you where you go, Brazil won Serbia nil, where's this game going to take us now, ball wide on the right hand side with Darko Lazovic who's taken up the right wing back roll, so does that mean Radonjec, yeah Radonjec the number seven has gone over to the left wing back roll and Vlivic and Tadec now in support of Mitrovic for Serbia and they've got the ball now, rare possession for them, ball played to Tadec, tries to give it back to Radonjec, taken away from him and here come Brazil and there's a lot of space for Neymar, Neymar running at the Serbian defenders, ball might get to Venetius Junior, good turn from Venetius Junior, opening up for the shot and he slips and slices it well wide, just on a couple of occasions there it looked like Neymar might get in, that chance disappeared then it looked like Venetius Junior might get in, that one disappeared, both players are still down, the referee stopped the game and we will have a slight break in play, Brazil won Serbia nil. There was two on two, wonderful pass to release Neymar, centre of the pitch and then he's driving forward looking for the run of Venetius Junior, got challenged, got tackled and the ball broke to Venetius Junior, Illic tries to nick in front of him and he rolls him, drives into the box and just as he's going to fire a shot with his left foot he slips and the chance gone there, want that second goal, Brazil they want to put this game to bed as soon as possible. Not sure Neymar did his laces up properly, started the second half because he's trying to get that right boot back on at the moment. Looks like the Serbians are going to back four now. Okay, pass blocked by Roshalosan, yeah you're right and there's Milenkovic who looks like he's playing it right back in the four now, Illic, 21 year old, plays across to his left hand side to Pavlovic, the big centre back goes lumbering forward, stays up there in the attack, why not, they're trailing 1-0, want to try and get something out of this game, their next game in the group is against Cameroon, Switzerland the other team in this group, Cross comes in from the left and that's intercepted by Casemiro, doing that job that he always does, behind for a corner. Amazing isn't it, a difference a goal makes, the Serbians now pushing Brazil back, got a risk to get back into this game. Midway through the second half, Chris Sutton with us on five live in BBC sounds, Brazil five times winners of the World Cup, world number one ranked team leading Serbia 1-0, defending the corner, head a well over there, Crossbar from the big fella, the big bouncer Pavlovic gets underneath it and can't get it on target. Such a big team aren't they, it's a left footed out swinger, Pavlovic leaps well but is under pressure from Thiago Silva who just does enough. And that experience just uses his body well, leans into Pavlovic and he heads the ball over the bar, well over the bar. You and I Chris by the way are back here on Saturday for a big one, five live seven o'clock kickoff UK time Argentina after that defeat in this stadium against Mexico on Saturday. That'll be some game and some atmosphere as well I think, oh now Brazil have lost it inside their own half, Vladovic clumsy first touch and then he's conceded the foul, oh he's won the corner, I thought he shoved him over, Thiago Silva certainly feels the same, Vladovic goes racing into the middle, wants to try and get on the end of something, sloppy from Brazil giving it away, so Serbia have a chance to attack again and as Chris was just saying they do have height and strength and muscle inside that Brazilian penalty area. Corner comes in from the right, right away Crossbar, straight up in the air, headed back by Malinkovic Savage, nodded off the line, acrobatic attempt from Vladovic has miscued and eventually the ball is smashed behind for a goal kick and Brazil survive. Marquinhos off the line, it's a brilliant corner, left footed in swing at Malinkovic, Savage, the Serbian midfielder gets up, heads to ball across, Marquinhos, I don't know if it was going in, Mitrovic was behind him, but he powers the ball clear, Marquinhos little high five, Danilo is right back, that's their danger the Serbians. If you know it will be a good listen Chris if they put it in the World Cup daily, because I know they've been doing a bit of that in this tournament, is the Brazilian commentary on the Rashalison goal. Been doing that with a lot of the goals in this World Cup, I would love to hear that. Big moment for the opening game, they're leading Serbia by a goal to nil and if you look in ahead to tomorrow's action, here's Tadic, Tadic, Lopas to Mitrovic, edge of the Brazilian box, tries to scoop one into the middle, doesn't get it right and the ball bounces into the arms of Alisson. Statmandave at the end of every World Cup daily, just has a little sort of tactical look ahead at some of the players and what we're going to see in the day ahead. Big day on five live tomorrow, Wales are running full at ten, England USA in full at seven o'clock, Qatar Senegal at one, and Netherlands Ecuador at four o'clock. Those are your four commentaries on five live and BBC sounds tomorrow. Brazil leading Serbia by a goal to nil, throwing for them wide on the right, right on the halfway line, thrown up towards Rashalison, Rashalison with his back to goal is able to lay it off to Rafinha, finds Neymar, central position, 30 yards out. What spell can he weave here? Looking for Paketar, not a very good one. Pass was ahead of Paketar and Serbia were able to bring it away down the right. With Lazovic, he's lost it. Venetius Junior will gobble that up all day long, goes tearing at this tired Serbian defence and then his pass is intercepted looking for Neymar. And Ilic is able to get on the ball and Serbia with Malinkovic, Savic now deep in his own half, drives a high diagonal ball away to the left. Danilo watches it, lets it bounce and it goes out for a throw into Brazil. Yeah, but it's opened up now, hasn't it, the game? Serbians pushing forward showing greater intent onto 4-4-2. Looks like Fred is ready to come on. G.J. just wanting to see this game through. Yeah, Fred is stripped off and ready to go, wearing number eight for Brazil at this World Cup. Full thrown down the right for Brazil, Rafinha just gives it a meaty swing at the left boot and very nearly turns into a wonderful pass for Venetius Junior. Picked up by Aleksandro inside his own half, passes played beyond Neymar, but Venetius Junior immediately gives it to the more senior player. Neymar gives it back to him and says, no, I quite like what you're doing this evening. Outside of the right foot, Rishalosov with the volley, what a goal! Brazilian brilliance at its best, that is absolutely sensational. Cross him from the left, Rishalosov knocks it up in the air, spins and air-crabatically smashes it home to make it Brazil 2, Serbia 0. How about that? Wow, Brazilian magic, it really is. This is genius from Rishalosov, his first goal was a tap in, his second goal was a wally. Unbelievable, Venetius Junior down the left hand side, outside of the right boot, into Rishalosov, from the balls in the air, what a yard off the floor, Rishalosov flicks it up with the inside of his left boot, spins, overhead kick, into the corner, no chance for the Serbian goalkeeper. Acrobatics at its very best, that's absolutely stunning, isn't it? Chris, when you come to a World Cup and watch Brazil, that is the kind of thing you dream of, and that is up there with the very best goals Brazilian players have scored at World Cups. And I don't think I'm exaggerating, they're touched with the left foot, and then the audacity and the skill and the athleticism to turn and volley it like that and catch it so cleanly, that was just fabulous. Brazil 2, Serbia 0, and we were talking before the game with Kelly Cates about moments that you associate Brazil with the World Cup and we've all got them. And that for lots of our listeners tonight and people watching, that'll be one. That was magical. Paqueta is coming off and Fred is coming on. Two goals in the game for Rishalosov. Wow. Wonderful, wonderful the way he takes the ball and flicks it up. He knows what he wants to do as the ball's on its way, but you have those pictures in your head, those ideas in your head. But can you carry them out? Can you carry them off? And ball he did. It's incredible. The connection, the timing. The flexibility, Bruce. Well, you were showing it in the gym earlier today, Chris. Something similar. Well. Can he get his hat trick? Let's see. He barely had a kick in the first half, didn't he? 15 minutes to play. Rishalosov on a hat trick and that you've got to go and find that goal. It's on BBC Television tonight with the BBC TV games. Remember, you can listen to us at the same time. I play World Cup Extra, so I would very biasly say obviously you get the best of both worlds, but I hope you've seen that goal this evening or you will get to see it very soon. That was breathtaking. Brazil 2, Serbia now. Final day, final day. Final game, I beg your pardon, of World Cup action. Plenty more coming your way tomorrow with Wales and England back in action. Rick Edwards as ever with the breakfast output from 6 o'clock tomorrow morning live from Doha. Ian Rush, one of the guests ahead of Wales. Iran full commentary on that one at 10. Here come Brazil. They're in the party mood. Ball in towards Rodrigo at the far post. Well, what they're up there with the best, the very best is when the game becomes stretched and they have space, they will exploit. And the game has opened up. Serbia want to get back in this game, but here they go again, Brazil. Yeah, this could be bad for Serbia. Rodrigo on as a sub, dancing feet inside the penalty. Oh, he was trying to line himself up for the right foot shot. Casemiro is going to try and thump one from 40 yards out. That's blocked. That might be a corner. I think it is a corner. And the official attendance figure for this evening, 88,000 people. And just looking round, it is hard to find an empty seat. And as I said at this other game, this stadium is absolutely enormous. Plenty of games here during this World Cup, including the final. Now, John Murray apparently had a bit of trouble. I think getting back from a stadium last night, Chris, he will be here for the final. I think we would say set off early to find this one, because we had a spot to bother to this evening. Well, more youth in the... More youth in me. Well, we had Chris Bevin, didn't we, from the BBC website? That was a key one, wasn't it, where he said... He won't be sitting in the front again. No, he won't. He helps Chris with the BBC sport predictions, more of those. He doesn't help me with the predictions. He roasts me most weeks, doesn't he? Little stoppage in play here. Has Naimov got a problem with the shoelaces again? So someone is actually having to do them for him now. I mean, if you are Naimov, you can get people to do that for you. I mean, should you probably do at home, have people to do your shoelaces? Actually, I hope he's okay. He's down. The medical team are there as well. Let's hope he's all right. Is Rishalison coming off? I think he might be. Gabrielle J. Zouss, that's lovely from Gabrielle J. Zouss. He applauses Rishalison off. Thank you very much, Rishalison, for that moment of magic tonight, because that was absolutely unforgettable. And I think for a career moment for him, and I know it's only the first group game, Chris, and you want to go on and win a tournament, but moments like that... You know, to look back at the Indian career and say you scored a goal like that. Well, that's goal of the World Cup so far. Well, I'm not sure, because I've not seen every single goal, but... Well, you've seen a lot. I remember. It's watching it again now. Vanessa Estunia fizzes the ball into him. He's got bodies around him. Inside of his left foot, flicks it up, over his head, swivels, bang! Right-footed. Into the corner, whistles pass the Serbian goalkeeper, and the joy in the stadium. The stadium erupted. The reason I'm not quite going for it, because in a very early game I did in 2014, Tim Cahill scored a wonder volley against the Netherlands. I said so far. And in the commentary, I said, you will not see a better goal than that at this World Cup, and the next day there was about one score. Yeah, but I didn't say that. I said so far, that is the best goal of the tournament. Might well be a debate in the World Cup Daily podcast on the BBC Sound app. Anyway, we still got ten minutes of fun and a bit more to have here. Brazil leading Serbia by two goals to nil. Running at them, tearing them apart. Ball down the right, might come back to Raphine, Malinkovic-Savage gets a foot in. Rodrigo, again trying a little bit of skill in the penalty area. It's cleared away. Runs now to the left-hand side. And there's Antony, who's come on the field. It's not fair, is it, really? No. Antony. He's going to do it off. Rodrigo, Gabriel Tresus. Antony trying to get on one down the inside left channel. He's chased here. Sliding challenge on him. I'm not sure who touched the ball last there. Brazil get, no they don't. Serbia get a goal kick. The sliding challenge came in from Lazavic. But actually neither player touched the ball. Just wondering whether it could be time for one of Antony's sort of 360 pirouettes. Is this the sort of occasion where it merits it? Ball up towards the halfway line. Rodrigo jumps for a header on a bouncing ball. Malinkovic, Savic has lost it. Gabriel Tresus now plays into the path of Fred. Fred to his right-hand side. Rafinha's had some chances this evening. Could this be the moment? Rafinha, playing it back to the edge of the box. Tresus lays it off. Casemiro hits the ball. Thought that was three. Beautiful, peachy curling shot that he thought was destined for the top corner. So did 88,000 people inside the stadium. And it's come bouncing back off the woodwork. I'm losing track of who all these Brazilian players are and where they're playing at the moment. Alexandro back to Thiago Silva. Brazil to Serbia nil. They're in full flow now on there. And that was a brilliant move. Neymar who's now playing out on that right-hand side. Across the pitch into Casemiro who strode onto the ball. Rodrigo to Fred. Back to Rodrigo. First time a look of it savage this time. Palms it away. Getting down low to his left-hand side. Brazil want more. And the fans are absolutely loving it in here. Danilo to Casemiro. Tries a little back heel pass. Alexandro alert. Gets there. Rodrigo plays the pass back here to Danilo. Wide on the right-hand side is Rafinha. And he's just teasing the defender there. Standing there and saying, come and get it. Fred with the little flick ball. Gabriel J.Zu is on the turn. Just run off it. Good, strong defending from Milenkovic for Serbia. Brazil leads Serbia by two goals to nil. They beat Serbia by two goals to nil when they played in the World Cup in 2018. And they really had just cranked it up, haven't they? Second half, Brazil. They have done, they've played with great urgency. And you felt, as I said, the Serbians, you sit back against Brazil. They have the individual brilliance to open you up. And they're doing it at will now. Fred, left footed drive. Good save, Milenkovic Savic. He's just taking potshots now. Milenkovic Savic screaming at his defenders, saying, hang on, I'm facing the entire Brazilian team on my own here. He's made some good saves in this game. Fred gave that the hammer. It's a brilliant save because Fred left footed on the half turn. Space opens up, drives the space centrally. 23, 24 yards out. And fizzes a left foot shot. Milenkovic Savic gets that big right hand to it. Mitrovic off, Maksimovic on. Mitrovic being saved for the other two group games. Over on the left-hand side is Antony. Plays a little 1-2 with Rodrigo. Sandro could easily have scored as well. Remember that shot, that low fizzer that came back off the post. Wide here to Raphinha, little chip ball into the box. Milenkovic Savic off his line, which is powerfully clear. Casamiro, the volley's a pass to his left. The offside flag was up. And so, now I started my stopwatch five minutes late. So 33 out of 5 is 38. Seven minutes plus added time remaining in this game. You sense, well, certainly the Brazilian fans don't want it to stop. The Brazilian players, I think, because most of them are fresh out there now, having made all the changes, they don't want it to stop. I don't want it to stop. It's been brilliant to watch. It has been. Now, chance for Serbia to attack down the left-hand side. Radonjevic gets down to the byline, and then his control lets him down. It goes behind for a goal kick. You've got to say that the Brazilian defence, aging as it is in the goalkeeper, added up early 158 years between Alisson and the backfoul. The Brazilian backfoul, plenty of experience in there. Haven't really been tested yet. Driven shot there from Milenkovic, edge of the box. Alisson desperately trying to keep it in play to prevent it going out for a corner, throws himself at it, but can't do that corner for Serbia. This can they for the Serbians. Can they give Brazil something to think about? They haven't looked like scoring an open play. Well, got a set piece now. Five minutes plus added time remaining. Serbian corner, a way swinger coming in from the right. They've got the height to challenge. Brazil have managed to get it out, and a pass into the box is blocked, and now look at these yellow shirts coming flying forward on the counter. Antony, inside his own half, Pirouettes on the ball, plays it back to Casamiro, inside to Alexandro, and then Thiago Silva strokes a lovely ball away to the right, and Danilo's got space to run into. Rafinha ahead of him, he just lends the ball to Rafinha. Rafinha goes casually jogging right on that touch line away on the right-hand side, back to Danilo. Here's Makinios, Serbia in there, red shirts, ball chasing late in the game, two-nil down, and having to think about the next one against Cameroon on Monday. Good run by Gabrielle J. Zouce down the right. Now, can he find a teammate in the middle? Quick silver feet, low ball into the near post, blocked, only as far as Fred, 25 yards out, plays back here. Makinios in the middle of the Serbian half, across to Casamiro, Casamiro, side-foot to ball to Antony. Antony just goes dancing backwards, little one-two with Thiago Silva. Antony, again, teasing defenders, all he went for the old elastico and it's worked, gets in between the two of them, plays the ball to... Oh, Rodrigo with the curler just wide. That was not far away, hit it beautifully with his right foot, and it's gone behind with the goal kick. He lets the ball run across his body. Rodrigo in the 18-yard line, just trying to bend the ball into the far top corner. Old elastico, Bruce, you've been on the end of one of those, haven't you? I have. I remember telling you about that, yeah, in the piazza in Perugia, the Algerian, Fellerie did me with elastico. Wasn't going to fall for it a second time, Chris, but honestly, it's the best bit of skill I've ever had done against me. Chris, although I've not played... I've played with you yet, actually. Gabriel Martinelli is coming on. So for those exhausted Serbian defenders, there's someone else to think about. Rafini is coming off, should have had a goal tonight, definitely should have had at least one goal, but was always dangerous on the right-hand side. Brazil 2, Serbia 0. Ball cleared away from the edge of the Brazilian penalty area, headed forward by Ilic, bouncing ball. Knotted down the right here to Antony, so Martinelli's on the left, Antony is now on the right for Brazil, curling ball into the edge of the box, knotted down, Martinelli, first touch of the evening, head down, got real speed, quickly across the halfway line, in fact, he's going to try and use a bit more of it, still going, bringing this ball into the Serbian penalty area. With the pullback, can't find a teammate in the middle, cleared away, but only for now. Brazil might be able to come again. Just kept going and going, didn't he? Martinelli. Arquinios down the right to Antony, in his bright orange boots, Antony works it onto his left foot, goes for the curler, gets it all wrong, way over the bar and behind for a goal kick. Brazil 2, Serbia 0. Yeah, what do we make of Statman Day's left field pick? Serbia, well, give them a chance. Yeah, I mean, that's what I'd say, Chris. I mean, it looks like, I mean, I think, look, before a ball was kicked in this group, of course, everybody would say Brazil, but with Switzerland winning today, you've got a lot of work to do. They do. Haven't shown enough going forward for me. No. Barely mentioned, Vlávics' name since coming on, but Brazil have completely taken over the game, and here they come again. Stylish, slick, silky football, great run on the outside here, made by Danilo. Cross comes in towards Jesus, Martin Ali with the head wide. And that's goal kick or free kick? Goal kick. Oh, no, a free kick. Because Malinković Savic has thrown the ball further forward. Haven't seen Danilo do that very much at all, have we? No. And the poor Serbian back line, see him hurtling forward down that right-hand side. Overlap, cross in, but free kick. Malinković Savic, the goalkeeper, clears with his right foot. Can't be controlled by Ilic, Serbira, a slowing down, Brazil might fancy one more into the 90th minute of the game. One more reminder about our commentaries on the way tomorrow, starting with Wales, Iran at 10, as Fred gets onto the ball, wide on the right-hand side, England back in action tomorrow as well, against the USA. And that game in full from 7 o'clock, John Murray, Rob Green and Micah Richards all part of the commentary team, Chris and Robbie Savic taking the calls after the England game on another day of World Cup football coming your way on five live in BBC Sounds. Also Katar Senegal at one o'clock UK time tomorrow in Netherlands, Ecuador, which I think is going to be a really interesting game actually in group A. Ole time for the Brazilian fans. Every single pass is getting cheered. The Serbians won't like that. Undone by two Rishalison goals this evening, and the second of them absolutely sensational. Now Brazil, the Olas have to stop, they've given it away. The ball is played back to the halfway line to Lazovic. Now forward into the centre circle, Malinkovic-Savic, across to Pavlovic, seven minutes of added time. Tadic on the ball, little one-two with Malinkovic-Savic, plays it forward towards Ilic, out to the left now to Pavlovic. Back again to Tadic, and Tadic comes back towards the halfway line, and Maksimovic plays to his right-hand side. That's Velkovic, high lofted ball away to the left, controlled by Radonjic. Pressure on him from Antony, but they've worked it well, Serbia. Radonjic in a crossing position on the left, Marquinhos is able to head that away at the near post. The ball drops for Antony, tried to control it on the volley, couldn't bring it down, it bounces a couple of times, gets away from him and goes out for a throw into Serbia. They take it quickly, into added time at the end of the game. Malinkovic-Savic, little scoop pass for Tadic, keeps it in play, cross lobbed towards the far post, Alisson went for it, couldn't get there, bumps into his own defender and knocks him over, that was Aleksandro. Serbia have it wide on the right with Malinkovic, he's tackled, but actually he's the one to concede the throw, and so Brazil will take their time, Brazil to Serbia-Nil. Yep, they've been really poor in the final third. Serbia can't ever remember an incisive pass, everything's gone out wide, the cross balls into the box, but it's really little effects. In Brazil, I think this performance is just saying to everybody else, we're here, you better watch out. Referee is saying, I'm here, hurry up, get on with the throw in. I've got one more chi-che quote, I want to read you if I've got time. But the ball is back in play, flick on from Gabriel, Jézus Martinelli might get there first, bumps into the defender, but Jézus is onto the loose ball, all clever from Jézus, that was a bad challenge on Jézus from Pavlovic, book for that actually, Jézus gets it from Martinelli, can't tee himself up for the shot in the penalty area, Serbia clear and then Danilo's hobbling. Yeah, he was down in the box. A couple of minutes ago, I'm not a medical expert, Bruce, whether that's cramp or not, he's not waving over to... Five-subs, they've used all five, so that's a problem, not a problem in terms of the game, but right back in this squad is 39-year-old Dani Alvez, who could break Thiago Silva's record that he's just made tonight, becoming the oldest Brazilian player to play the World Cup. You're not a medical expert. I'm not. Added time, end of the game in the loose-sale stadium, Brazil 2, Serbia 0. He is hobbling, yeah, he is hobbling, but what are they going to do? He wants some help at the back from Anthony, and Anthony's saying, no, I want to have fun, I want to go forward and get the ball. I want to score a goal. Yeah, so are they going to leave him out there? Looks like they are. Allison bouncing the ball here, he's had a very quiet evening, volleys it forward with his right foot. Come on, Allison, huffing the ball up the pitch. This is Brazil, this is a World Cup. Hang on. We've seen the best goal of the tournament so far, and Allison huffing the ball up the pitch out of his hands. Serbia have taken the free kick. It's going to tie nicely with my Q-Tag quote, if I can get it out. The Brazilian manager managing it back-to-back World Cups. Serbia on the ball though, with Pavlovic. Now Tadec, looking for the ball through to Vljavic, cut out. Beautifully red from Tiago Silva. Yeah, ball out wide to Martin Eli, beaten in the air by Milenkovic. So, Gice says, I don't want to throw away my principles and win this thing at any cost. I'm not saying this is an excuse if we lose. I've won everything in my career, the only thing missing is the World Cup. We want to win by being the best, fairly, with pride, at being technically more developed, faster with more quality, more creativity and more goals. And here they come, down the left-hand side. Rodrigo looking for a third cross comes in, not enough on that, and cleared away by Vljavic in the middle. Can they find one more tonight? Do you believe Tice after seeing Allison punt the ball down the pitch 80 yards? Mix it up a bit, Chris, that's what I'd say. At a time at the end of this game, Brazil leading Serbia by two goals to Neely, then added not with the influence of dirty play, provoking the opposition, looking for little advantages. It's been the odd dive, hasn't it? Ball down the left from Sandro, Martin Eli chests it down. Ball spins to a stop on the laces of his right boot, teasing defenders up to the edge of the box trying to slide it back here to Rodrigo. They are frightening, aren't they? The attacking players they have on the bench, I mean, Glimy. And there's been a nice balance to the team. They haven't looked like conceding. That back four, they've been in place, Casemiro just... Brilliant at protecting the back four, and he's been a real enforcer in there. The odd time he's drifted forward, unlucky not to score. Quick throw from Serbia looking for Vladovic, falls over, and he now seems him in pain. Hold it in the back of his left leg. Troton is ankle, didn't he? Troton is Achilles. Oh, see, accidentally actually. No, he clips him. If Brazil win this group, they will play the runners-up. Come on, these games, dude. That's a bit disrespectful. That's if. If Brazil win this group, and I think they will, what do you think? Don't underestimate Switzerland. OK, they will play the runners-up of the Portugal Ghana Uruguay South Korea. So basically you're saying Brazil are going all the way. You're the predictions expert, you're the man who's big in Japan. You tell me. I hope you predicted them to win the next one. Eric goes again. He's gone long. What about this beautiful kind of football and loving it? Look at it. Ah! Up to J. Zusey, lays it off. Are you sure those quotes are associated with G. J? I think he gave them to Tim Vickery in the publication I'm reading from. Tim Vickery's on after. Yeah, we'll ask him. We'll ask him. I like those quotes. Malinkovic Savic. Ball at his feet. Brazil trying to win a sixth World Cup at this tournament, and they've started well. Serbia on the ball, bringing it out of their own half with the 21-year-old Ilic Radonjevich. Plays it back to Pavlovic. Pavlovic turns back to his goalkeeper. He's had a good game. He has had a good game. Yeah, I mean, the score line would have been far worse than it had not been for him. Now they come forward. Ball across from Velkovic, controlled by Ilic. Radonjevich in space on the left-hand side. Up against Antony. Takes Antony on the inside. Radonjevich with the right-footed shot. Blocked. Kasimiro, obviously. Turned his back, got his body in the way. That's it for the entertainment this evening. But look out for Brazil at Qatar 2022. And look out for their number nine. We were talking about their number ten before the game. Neymar just two goals shy of Pele's record for the Brazilian team. But goodness me, Pele would be very, very proud of Rishalison's second goal tonight. He scored both. The first stabbing into an empty net after Malinkovic's savage had made a fabulous save. But the second was just a joy to behold. Kross came in from the left. He flicked it up with his left foot, swiveled in midair, and smashed it in with his right foot. And it was beautiful, Chris Sutton. Yeah, goal of the tournament so far. The work of art, wasn't it, from Rishalison? It really was stunning. Great support for Brazil. I thought it was a display of real authority. Allison didn't have anything to do really strong at the back. And they have those flair players going forward. But Rishalison, the difference this evening, and off to a great start, Brazil. Brazilian fans enraptured all around us in this giant stadium. They are off to a winning start, as they so often are at these World Cups. Number one ranked team in the world. And particularly in that second half, just showed us a little bit of that Brazilian magic. Plenty more to come at this World Cup. They've beaten Serbia in their opening game by two goals to nil.",
