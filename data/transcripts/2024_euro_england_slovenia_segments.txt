[0.00 - 7.00] P:1459.50 E:0.069153 |  Now to the back to Mark Gay, who's been as good as anyone in this England European Championship campaign so far.
[7.00 - 13.00] P:1479.84 E:0.103042 |  Declan Rice as well. Basically, is he Christiansen? Conor Cody, the pressure is on for these England players to deliver.
[13.00 - 18.00] P:1441.02 E:0.109537 |  It is. It certainly is, John, and what we want to see is an assured performance from England.
[18.00 - 27.00] P:1554.45 E:0.110156 |  We want to see some crisp passing out there, we want to see goals, and we want to see dominance to take us into the knockout stages with clarity and confidence.
[27.00 - 35.00] P:1586.17 E:0.106387 |  So we'll keep you across what's happening in the other match, Denmark and Serbia, both kicking off simultaneously.
[35.00 - 41.00] P:1598.83 E:0.105255 |  But in this group, this last match night in Group C, if England win, they will finish top.
[41.00 - 49.00] P:1605.61 E:0.108001 |  But if Denmark win, they'll go through. If Slovenia win, they'll go through. And if Serbia win, they'll go through.
[49.00 - 53.00] P:1705.65 E:0.103177 |  So there is lots to play for.
[54.00 - 60.00] P:1800.36 E:0.109026 |  The whistle goes from Clement Erpan, and this time it's Phil Forden who kicks off for England.
[60.00 - 66.00] P:1666.72 E:0.095240 |  Bukaj Osaka has taken the spot kick for the centre-circle kick for the first two matches.
[66.00 - 72.00] P:1785.82 E:0.100264 |  But Forden starts for England here, and England go back into their own half to Gay.
[72.00 - 79.00] P:1802.63 E:0.104317 |  First impressions are going to be important for England. The way that they start in the opening five minutes, the opening ten minutes,
[79.00 - 86.00] P:1661.64 E:0.102239 |  that's what everyone's going to look for tonight. They need a confidence build-out here in Cologne, where the sun's still shining,
[86.00 - 93.00] P:1584.15 E:0.100273 |  blue sky above, and down there on the pitch, which is a good deal better than the pitch in Frankfurt, of course it is.
[93.00 - 100.00] P:1605.00 E:0.106697 |  They're tripping out to Bellingham at close quarters, and then Bellingham taking it back into his own half to give Jordan Pickford his first touch.
[100.00 - 104.00] P:1636.98 E:0.107564 |  There's a bit of feeling behind that as he passed it out to John Stones.
[104.00 - 110.00] P:1654.43 E:0.100634 |  It comes back from Stones to Pickford, and now Mark Gay begins to travel forwards.
[110.00 - 117.00] P:1605.67 E:0.109518 |  Declan Rice has dropped all the way back there. Conor Gallagher has taken up a rather advanced position in midfield actually.
[117.00 - 124.00] P:1679.56 E:0.107453 |  Right now as I speak, it is Rice in the middle with Gallagher forward to his right, and Bellingham forward to his left.
[124.00 - 129.00] P:1719.33 E:0.103466 |  It comes back to Rice, and England are forced back towards the edge of their penalty area.
[129.00 - 137.00] P:1628.87 E:0.100157 |  Gay turns towards the flank, left-footed towards the half-way line, but it comes off a Slovenian head, and they will give a first touch.
[137.00 - 140.00] P:1748.95 E:0.103337 |  At the other end to Jan Oblak, is he?
[140.00 - 148.00] P:1704.84 E:0.104122 |  Oh, that's a short pass out from the back from Oblak, and Forden was very nearly onto that, but they were able to recover.
[148.00 - 152.00] P:1611.69 E:0.101701 |  Conor Ničnik was able to get there, but England now are able to snatch back position.
[152.00 - 157.00] P:1684.74 E:0.104022 |  Here's Rice on the left-hand side. Rice drags it back, Trippiana with his right foot, plays it down the line to Forden.
[157.00 - 164.00] P:1702.76 E:0.108190 |  Forden under this, drags it back, but as the challenge came in, he was trying to win the free kick off Krakusic.
[164.00 - 169.00] P:1662.21 E:0.103063 |  He actually deflected it behind, he tried to win the free kick, but he wasn't successful. It's a goal kick.
[169.00 - 173.00] P:1620.55 E:0.109135 |  It's more positive for England, Phil Foden getting in down that left-hand side.
[173.00 - 180.00] P:1642.26 E:0.105618 |  I think it was Rice that just fed the ball into the channel, and Foden is really tightly marked, and you can see what he's trying to do.
[180.00 - 185.00] P:1679.01 E:0.101726 |  He's trying to chop the ball back onto his right foot, but concedes the goal kick.
[185.00 - 188.00] P:1676.78 E:0.113747 |  England nail Slovenia, nail it, you've just switched on.
[188.00 - 196.00] P:1701.16 E:0.107692 |  Now a chance, the first chance of the match for Slovenia as Stojanovic is able to break through to the edge of the penalty area.
[196.00 - 204.00] P:1854.72 E:0.104970 |  It seemed to take a deflection, but the referee says very calmly it's a goal kick to England, who take a quick goal kick.
[204.00 - 211.00] P:1681.44 E:0.096861 |  Now Trippiana halfway inside is on half-care, and Trippiana will actually just pass it back to Pickford, who was looking the other way there.
[211.00 - 218.00] P:1596.69 E:0.099300 |  And in that, the referee has told them they need to go back and take the goal kick again.
[218.00 - 221.00] P:1516.59 E:0.101690 |  So, Pickford will do that.
[221.00 - 228.00] P:1526.57 E:0.109803 |  Pickford defending the goal to our right, where there is a raucous noise now coming out of the Slovenian supporters.
[228.00 - 237.00] P:1463.40 E:0.101368 |  Pickford long and left-footed. Cain had a look as B all came in with the challenge, but the left-sided central defender was headed out on the far side.
[237.00 - 241.00] P:1594.65 E:0.084575 |  Walker takes the throw back to John Stones.
[241.00 - 244.00] P:1618.34 E:0.095132 |  Crossfield pass from him, right-footed to Cain and Trippiana.
[244.00 - 247.00] P:1625.80 E:0.092385 |  Now all the way to the left-hand side to Phil Thornton.
[247.00 - 252.00] P:1631.83 E:0.107444 |  There's quite a lot of talk about whether the Premier League player of the season would keep his place in this team.
[252.00 - 259.00] P:1768.96 E:0.107305 |  But Garret Southgate making just the one change as Bellingham has given it away on the halfway line.
[259.00 - 263.00] P:1698.63 E:0.104287 |  And so Spora will take it on, and he's fouled by Gallagher.
[263.00 - 271.00] P:1631.35 E:0.100648 |  Gallagher, incidentally, is on a yellow card. He's the only England player who's received a booking at Euro 2024 so far.
[271.00 - 276.00] P:1442.86 E:0.085755 |  They take the free kick quickly, Slovenia.
[276.00 - 282.00] P:1562.58 E:0.094625 |  They've had the two 1-1 draws. Remember the first match when Christian Ericsson gave Denmark an early lead.
[282.00 - 289.00] P:1608.74 E:0.103217 |  And then the most recent match when Serbia scored deep, deep into added time to make it 1-1.
[289.00 - 293.00] P:1750.14 E:0.091913 |  He's carrying the ball forward, giving it centrally to El Sniik.
[293.00 - 296.00] P:1601.03 E:0.091516 |  Now out to the left-hand side. Maka is out there.
[296.00 - 300.00] P:1676.25 E:0.102272 |  Here's the cross, which is deflected to the back post, knotted back across the England area.
[300.00 - 303.00] P:1686.27 E:0.107364 |  Cesko with a head-up, but he didn't get any power on that.
[303.00 - 307.00] P:1710.96 E:0.111998 |  And Pickford was able to move quickly to his right and just gather it into his stomach.
[307.00 - 312.00] P:1740.21 E:0.110736 |  It comes from a loose pass from Jude Bellingham about a minute ago, and it's just given Slovenia a bit of impetus.
[312.00 - 317.00] P:1753.48 E:0.094834 |  And it's that man Cesko inside the box who is a real threat inside that area.
[317.00 - 319.00] P:1806.04 E:0.092469 |  Just a free header, wasn't it Conor?
[319.00 - 324.00] P:1648.95 E:0.100887 |  Yeah, it was. It was a great play from Kani, sneak down the right-hand side, right across the pitch to the opposite side.
[324.00 - 326.00] P:1719.60 E:0.118001 |  England just got to be a little bit carefully.
[326.00 - 332.00] P:1688.88 E:0.102922 |  Given away by Gey, now played for Deshesko, but in came Declan Rice with a covering challenge to take it away.
[332.00 - 336.00] P:1562.21 E:0.094420 |  careless again from England, that was a missed place pass from Gey.
[336.00 - 341.00] P:1710.50 E:0.099540 |  And I think the ball has just gone out of play on the far side it did.
[341.00 - 343.00] P:1834.54 E:0.105818 |  So it's a throw in to England.
[343.00 - 346.00] P:1895.18 E:0.101746 |  It's been a bit sloppy for England, to be honest.
[346.00 - 349.00] P:1847.48 E:0.116217 |  These opening exchanges, they look a little bit nervous out there.
[349.00 - 352.00] P:1872.94 E:0.083236 |  They've just been a couple of loose passes.
[352.00 - 361.00] P:1794.91 E:0.090471 |  You know, on the stakes like that, this Slovenian side has enough talent in it to take advantage.
[361.00 - 363.00] P:1873.75 E:0.102991 |  And Cesko's yet to score.
[363.00 - 366.00] P:1814.81 E:0.108512 |  I think he's done everything but, hasn't he? He's at the woodwork.
[366.00 - 369.00] P:1844.62 E:0.111082 |  He's had chances fly wide and high.
[369.00 - 374.00] P:1635.40 E:0.102995 |  Throw in taken by Walker and Kane rather awkwardly can't take it down.
[374.00 - 376.00] P:1498.25 E:0.092847 |  It's a difficult height for him.
[376.00 - 379.00] P:1422.93 E:0.086825 |  So Janža from left back.
[379.00 - 385.00] P:1460.47 E:0.102242 |  As Slovenia go back into central defence to Drakusic, tall and shaven headed.
[385.00 - 390.00] P:1720.04 E:0.105812 |  Long pass forward from him, Walker is there to head it back to Pickford,
[390.00 - 393.00] P:1737.12 E:0.108174 |  who's able to gather it and overarm it out.
[393.00 - 396.00] P:1776.57 E:0.096867 |  0-0, five minutes played.
[396.00 - 400.00] P:1748.38 E:0.102572 |  Still 0-0 in the Denmark-Serbia game, the other match in the group.
[400.00 - 402.00] P:1672.97 E:0.107832 |  So it's as you were.
[402.00 - 406.00] P:1699.01 E:0.105461 |  It's tricky, he plays a right-footed ball forward for Bellingham to chase down the left wing.
[406.00 - 410.00] P:1608.24 E:0.104075 |  And Drakusic comes across and heads it out of play for an England throw.
[410.00 - 412.00] P:1553.41 E:0.104881 |  It's a good forward run from Bellingham.
[412.00 - 416.00] P:1618.04 E:0.104846 |  We've needed him to do that when Harry Kane drops deep to run the channels,
[416.00 - 420.00] P:1818.10 E:0.109782 |  squeeze England up the park, but England really needs to get some passes together now,
[420.00 - 422.00] P:1861.97 E:0.094843 |  get the grip of the game.
[422.00 - 425.00] P:1891.58 E:0.112558 |  Go back to the halfway line again into the centre-circle.
[425.00 - 428.00] P:1908.62 E:0.102961 |  Really is a sweltering night here.
[428.00 - 433.00] P:1885.28 E:0.098632 |  The hottest night that we've experienced so far in Cologne, Bellingham.
[433.00 - 439.00] P:1861.21 E:0.098873 |  Back towards the halfway line, Declan Rice was scoffing, wasn't it yesterday
[439.00 - 443.00] P:1854.28 E:0.096929 |  at the thought that fitness was a problem for the England teams.
[443.00 - 445.00] P:1800.84 E:0.091795 |  Almost left off the questions.
[445.00 - 449.00] P:1838.94 E:0.094405 |  He has gay trippie, ten yards inside his own half.
[449.00 - 454.00] P:1863.56 E:0.094158 |  And then Tickford comes out of his penalty area, whirling his arms.
[454.00 - 459.00] P:1867.84 E:0.106945 |  It is Stones in possession, those Stones passing it square to Gay again.
[459.00 - 462.00] P:1862.97 E:0.110798 |  And then Gay forward to the left-hand side to Foden.
[462.00 - 465.00] P:1914.15 E:0.102140 |  Foden's got trippie down the line, but Foden comes in field,
[465.00 - 470.00] P:1862.42 E:0.101731 |  goes back to the halfway line to Rice, and then Rice uses John Stones again.
[470.00 - 473.00] P:1802.30 E:0.101818 |  Pukaj Osaka, not sure I've mentioned his name yet.
[473.00 - 477.00] P:1801.99 E:0.097925 |  There he is though, in possession on the far side, quick ball back to Stones.
[477.00 - 479.00] P:1763.34 E:0.102340 |  Again, it goes square along the halfway line.
[479.00 - 481.00] P:1622.79 E:0.100832 |  Harry Kane's made himself available.
[481.00 - 485.00] P:1795.25 E:0.101996 |  Harry Kane so far at the Euros, just two touches in the opposition penalty area.
[485.00 - 490.00] P:1650.93 E:0.092758 |  Kane, long diagonal ball forward looking for Saka, Gallagher's over there.
[490.00 - 493.00] P:1645.60 E:0.096230 |  Slovenia are back in possession, and then Saka charges down the clearance,
[493.00 - 495.00] P:1768.09 E:0.116130 |  which is out for Slovenian ball.
[495.00 - 497.00] P:1655.16 E:0.120809 |  It would be interesting to hear what you think,
[497.00 - 499.00] P:1682.02 E:0.106527 |  but Slovenia are just being quite passive, aren't they?
[499.00 - 501.00] P:1635.40 E:0.114254 |  They're setting traps, they're not jumping and pressing,
[501.00 - 503.00] P:1809.51 E:0.100120 |  they're staying tight, structured.
[503.00 - 505.00] P:1789.38 E:0.111933 |  The hour is here, and do you know what? The shape's really good.
[505.00 - 508.00] P:1597.93 E:0.111902 |  They're in a 4-4-2, they're defending in a mid-block, low-block.
[508.00 - 511.00] P:1668.80 E:0.098000 |  They're in a situation where they're in contact with each other,
[511.00 - 513.00] P:1582.35 E:0.103414 |  and they're actually defending really well,
[513.00 - 515.00] P:1617.87 E:0.091037 |  but England are pushing on without a five going forward.
[515.00 - 517.00] P:1609.75 E:0.094534 |  We do, Bellungham, pushing on to the last line as well,
[517.00 - 519.00] P:1640.78 E:0.096907 |  so hopefully they can just sustain a bit of pressure there.
[519.00 - 522.00] P:1401.33 E:0.094277 |  So England will be going through tonight, whatever happens here,
[522.00 - 526.00] P:1575.26 E:0.096551 |  even if it's only in the third-place slot in the group,
[526.00 - 529.00] P:1612.87 E:0.099203 |  England's position in the round of 16 is secure.
[529.00 - 533.00] P:1654.29 E:0.099489 |  It's a question of which place they will finish in,
[533.00 - 535.00] P:1451.07 E:0.096250 |  first, second or third in the group.
[535.00 - 537.00] P:1381.55 E:0.096049 |  Right now, with the scorelines as they are,
[537.00 - 541.00] P:1419.01 E:0.095023 |  England would be going through to play one of the third-place sites,
[541.00 - 543.00] P:1564.66 E:0.085816 |  which would probably be the Netherlands,
[543.00 - 548.00] P:1401.25 E:0.097520 |  but that would have to be confirmed with the later matches in the other groups.
[548.00 - 551.00] P:1437.38 E:0.101692 |  Here's Trippier on the halfway line, gives it to Bellungham.
[551.00 - 554.00] P:1442.80 E:0.098206 |  Rice comes, 10 yards away, still inside Slovenian territory,
[554.00 - 557.00] P:1601.75 E:0.107238 |  once a break from Cesko, Bellungham makes the run,
[557.00 - 560.00] P:1596.99 E:0.102926 |  Declan Rice now to Kane, Kane turns his man on the edge of the box,
[560.00 - 562.00] P:1657.30 E:0.100484 |  tries to work it through,
[562.00 - 564.00] P:1703.29 E:0.097558 |  but Drakusic's just got enough on that,
[564.00 - 568.00] P:1710.83 E:0.091922 |  and Slovenia, Rear Avalde, a clear game back to Trippier.
[568.00 - 571.00] P:1631.45 E:0.087552 |  Trippier is going to go back into his own half,
[571.00 - 575.00] P:1611.93 E:0.090607 |  and that's what England are up against tonight.
[575.00 - 578.00] P:1658.31 E:0.100559 |  They're a rugged tear on a Drakusic and Beal.
[578.00 - 582.00] P:1693.06 E:0.089437 |  They're a problem, they've got some real quality in that.
[582.00 - 584.00] P:1732.31 E:0.097773 |  Good at defending, they're aggressive,
[584.00 - 587.00] P:1753.73 E:0.094332 |  you can just see here, Bellungham just dropping outside the structure
[587.00 - 590.00] P:1518.73 E:0.100796 |  of Sylvina, just to try and get touches on the ball,
[590.00 - 593.00] P:1598.76 E:0.094477 |  and they're out in this left position where it's meant to be more central,
[593.00 - 596.00] P:1645.44 E:0.091272 |  but that's where he's been given licence to go and receive the ball.
[596.00 - 598.00] P:1582.67 E:0.075695 |  Phil Fordham takes it in field,
[598.00 - 601.00] P:1567.38 E:0.084628 |  they did hit the post against Denmark,
[601.00 - 604.00] P:1380.57 E:0.092569 |  a couple of promising runs as well,
[604.00 - 607.00] P:1502.43 E:0.083790 |  but England with John Stones,
[607.00 - 611.00] P:1688.93 E:0.087336 |  winning his 75th cap tonight, John Stones.
[611.00 - 614.00] P:1792.79 E:0.103645 |  Gay to Bellungham, this is more central.
[614.00 - 617.00] P:1699.10 E:0.109587 |  Fordham back to Bellungham, couldn't take it in his stride,
[617.00 - 620.00] P:1669.67 E:0.103922 |  but again it's Slovenia who break away,
[620.00 - 622.00] P:1720.34 E:0.092120 |  and the ball slipped forward by Stojanovic,
[622.00 - 624.00] P:1769.94 E:0.102559 |  now Karnečnik, the right back,
[624.00 - 626.00] P:1758.67 E:0.100669 |  but England, Bellungham recovers well,
[626.00 - 629.00] P:1708.60 E:0.109203 |  and then Kane goes for the early pass to Fordham,
[629.00 - 631.00] P:1661.59 E:0.107449 |  Fordham into the penalty area on the left,
[631.00 - 634.00] P:1755.97 E:0.104205 |  Lefven and Krosbyd Saka slips over at the crucial moment,
[634.00 - 638.00] P:1675.74 E:0.096312 |  they were slightly behind him, and in actual fact,
[638.00 - 643.00] P:1734.08 E:0.096986 |  the offside flag is up in any case for the forward pass from Kane to Fordham.
[643.00 - 645.00] P:1690.24 E:0.101261 |  Yeah, it's just purely instinctive from Harry Kane,
[645.00 - 648.00] P:1689.73 E:0.104980 |  he's done the tracking back, he's done the dirty work for the team,
[648.00 - 651.00] P:1571.10 E:0.098471 |  he's picked up the ball and he's gone in behind to Fordham,
[651.00 - 653.00] P:1646.19 E:0.097320 |  who'd made the run, and Fordham just doesn't quite time it,
[653.00 - 655.00] P:1678.15 E:0.085285 |  unfortunately Saka slipped at the backstick,
[655.00 - 657.00] P:1633.02 E:0.104681 |  but he was offside anyway.
[657.00 - 659.00] P:1629.02 E:0.093532 |  We've got Izzy Christensen and Conor Cody,
[659.00 - 661.00] P:1624.03 E:0.099980 |  England, internationals both,
[661.00 - 663.00] P:1567.76 E:0.096234 |  up here with us in the five-life commentary position.
[663.00 - 665.00] P:1706.02 E:0.095779 |  Conor, we've played ten minutes now,
[665.00 - 668.00] P:1624.38 E:0.091838 |  we're all keen to see what England would do,
[668.00 - 670.00] P:1535.96 E:0.092020 |  how they would look, what do you think?
[670.00 - 672.00] P:1644.70 E:0.094707 |  I think they've started fine, I think they've controlled the game,
[672.00 - 674.00] P:1724.07 E:0.100959 |  we've just got to be careful just losing the ball,
[674.00 - 676.00] P:1530.89 E:0.106631 |  they've been a little bit of anxiety when the ball gets into...
[676.00 - 678.00] P:1682.84 E:0.093617 |  Here we go.
[678.00 - 680.00] P:1730.90 E:0.102818 |  Stojanovic down the right-hand side, takes on Trippia,
[680.00 - 682.00] P:1623.52 E:0.098433 |  Stojanovic is able to turn, keep possession,
[682.00 - 688.00] P:1511.08 E:0.091765 |  close Slovenia, and then Turing goes back into his own half
[688.00 - 692.00] P:1691.68 E:0.104568 |  to the number 21, Drakusic.
[692.00 - 695.00] P:1688.53 E:0.102052 |  Now again, they've got Stojanovic and Karnecic
[695.00 - 697.00] P:1666.83 E:0.104362 |  neat together on the right-hand side,
[697.00 - 699.00] P:1636.85 E:0.109814 |  and Stojanovic takes it up to the edge of the penalty area,
[699.00 - 701.00] P:1728.21 E:0.107330 |  Šporas pulled away, Šporas ball into the box,
[701.00 - 703.00] P:1782.48 E:0.100270 |  it slipped away from Reis, but Gallagher was there,
[703.00 - 707.00] P:1676.87 E:0.103112 |  covering behind him, and Gallagher, left-footed, was able to clear it.
[707.00 - 712.00] P:1729.58 E:0.084531 |  And the two matches so far, England have taken the lead in both matches,
[712.00 - 715.00] P:1634.61 E:0.089776 |  so yet to be behind at this tournament.
[715.00 - 720.00] P:1616.89 E:0.089803 |  And Slovenia, even though they are technically the outsiders in this group
[720.00 - 722.00] P:1440.43 E:0.098602 |  in terms of their world ranking,
[722.00 - 726.00] P:1679.39 E:0.104351 |  I think it is a misleading world ranking, 57 in the world,
[726.00 - 728.00] P:1672.25 E:0.104842 |  and as we keep saying, it was only a couple of weeks ago
[728.00 - 731.00] P:1611.59 E:0.105308 |  that England lost to the team ranked 72 in the world,
[731.00 - 735.00] P:1670.73 E:0.093711 |  Gay with the ball, half-way inside his own half.
[735.00 - 737.00] P:1758.07 E:0.095679 |  Trippier calls for it, Trippier gets it.
[737.00 - 740.00] P:1572.38 E:0.092729 |  There's a little bit of a concern about Trippier's fitness
[740.00 - 744.00] P:1597.45 E:0.091320 |  in advance of this, but Garasovic said he's absolutely fine,
[744.00 - 750.00] P:1753.69 E:0.087815 |  so Trippier gives it to Foden, then back to Trippier, again, who looks up,
[750.00 - 753.00] P:1873.64 E:0.101631 |  just rolls it to the feet of Gay.
[753.00 - 755.00] P:1904.23 E:0.113250 |  The ball has spent a lot of time in this match so far
[755.00 - 758.00] P:1934.97 E:0.103531 |  with the England central defenders,
[758.00 - 760.00] P:1923.74 E:0.113177 |  whistles from the Slovenian supporters.
[760.00 - 762.00] P:1891.99 E:0.106817 |  Gay now through the middle to Harry Kane.
[762.00 - 766.00] P:1905.71 E:0.100060 |  Once again in a deep-lying position, Kane gives it to Gallagher.
[766.00 - 769.00] P:1797.68 E:0.104444 |  Gallagher eventually gets there with the pass through Walker,
[769.00 - 772.00] P:1895.83 E:0.090850 |  then back to Conor Gallagher, again, John Stones calls for it.
[772.00 - 776.00] P:1862.45 E:0.092531 |  Stones begins to have a wonder forward, just forward of the centre-circle he is,
[776.00 - 779.00] P:1874.87 E:0.093597 |  Šesko though forces him to pass the ball to Trippier.
[779.00 - 782.00] P:1704.43 E:0.098345 |  Now he is belting him again, appearing on the left-hand side.
[782.00 - 785.00] P:1817.72 E:0.087273 |  This performance, England, lots of possession,
[785.00 - 789.00] P:1840.52 E:0.087341 |  but there is not the zip there yet that I think they and the England supporters
[789.00 - 791.00] P:1852.30 E:0.084577 |  would want to see.
[791.00 - 797.00] P:1872.31 E:0.090711 |  Gay now across towards Stones, and then Kyle Walker, again,
[797.00 - 802.00] P:1819.85 E:0.091987 |  just takes the ball back towards the halfway line, and then Declan Rice,
[802.00 - 806.00] P:1780.79 E:0.098323 |  and this is very safety first football from England,
[806.00 - 810.00] P:1804.33 E:0.098228 |  trying to find the opportunity, Foden now moving in field,
[810.00 - 816.00] P:1733.90 E:0.093975 |  Rice, he looks up, it goes square, Walker, Stones thought about the long pass,
[816.00 - 821.00] P:1764.70 E:0.094237 |  then it's gay again, I mean, talk about passion, this is extremely patient.
[821.00 - 823.00] P:1800.25 E:0.115486 |  Do you know what they're waiting for?
[823.00 - 826.00] P:1780.74 E:0.099571 |  They're waiting for a Slovenian player to jump out of the structure,
[826.00 - 829.00] P:1642.86 E:0.098897 |  but they are being so disciplined, England are just waiting and waiting and waiting,
[829.00 - 832.00] P:1766.75 E:0.110093 |  and you can see they're getting increasingly frustrated, Harry Kane's dropping deep,
[832.00 - 835.00] P:1662.13 E:0.094492 |  Conor Gallagher's tight in next to Declan Rice.
[835.00 - 841.00] P:1572.23 E:0.093503 |  So therefore the same pattern continues, England, nil, Slovenia, nil,
[841.00 - 845.00] P:1526.64 E:0.090620 |  England, after the disappointment of the second match
[845.00 - 849.00] P:1633.95 E:0.103625 |  against USA and Qatar, bounced back with a very good 3-0 win against Wales.
[849.00 - 855.00] P:1654.93 E:0.081212 |  That was a very powerful challenge, thereby big be all to take the ball,
[855.00 - 859.00] P:1697.35 E:0.094270 |  put the tackle in on Conor Gallagher, throw into England, Stones,
[859.00 - 861.00] P:1637.88 E:0.095924 |  long right footed pass, that's over the head of Trippie,
[861.00 - 865.00] P:1656.16 E:0.106541 |  and out of play, hear the reaction there from the England supporters,
[865.00 - 867.00] P:1707.67 E:0.094133 |  cheers from the Slovenians, Conor.
[867.00 - 871.00] P:1715.02 E:0.098681 |  Yeah, John, the way you used before, Zip, I think we need to move the ball quicker,
[871.00 - 874.00] P:1694.26 E:0.098889 |  I think there needs to be a little bit of pressure on the ball when you're zipping it in,
[874.00 - 877.00] P:1665.67 E:0.103923 |  put it with a little bit of a punch on it, just to move them a little bit more.
[877.00 - 879.00] P:1803.51 E:0.092097 |  They're comfortable in the shapes, they're actually doing it really well,
[879.00 - 882.00] P:1636.70 E:0.098193 |  they're shuffling across the pitch really well, we're getting movement quite nicely,
[882.00 - 885.00] P:1607.93 E:0.093771 |  but just that little punch on the ball, I think we need to get it a little bit quicker.
[885.00 - 889.00] P:1635.47 E:0.092067 |  Yeah, the talk yesterday, Declan Rice said to me, we want to dominate teams.
[889.00 - 895.00] P:1544.21 E:0.092310 |  But at the moment, it's the gentlest of starts, nil, nil, in both matches tonight,
[895.00 - 899.00] P:1669.05 E:0.087607 |  so it's as you were, England would be going through as group winners.
[900.00 - 901.00] P:1645.10 E:0.092623 |  Stones.
[902.00 - 905.00] P:1647.89 E:0.087882 |  Sheshko with the press on him, back to Pickford.
[905.00 - 908.00] P:1630.74 E:0.081679 |  Pickford left-footed to Tripier.
[908.00 - 914.00] P:1637.98 E:0.087254 |  Down there, all in black, Matjes Kek, the Slovenian coach,
[914.00 - 919.00] P:1552.99 E:0.096568 |  very experienced in his second spell as the coach of the Slovenian team.
[919.00 - 923.00] P:1427.66 E:0.095291 |  It was him who was in charge back in South Africa.
[923.00 - 928.00] P:1667.85 E:0.102868 |  Oh, John Stones, that's a poor touch from him as the ball is played across to him.
[928.00 - 932.00] P:1683.80 E:0.096815 |  Miscontrolled and it's out of play and I'm afraid that doesn't help the collective.
[932.00 - 935.00] P:1664.00 E:0.103893 |  Strange because we're not in Frankfurt now where the pitch was chopping up,
[935.00 - 939.00] P:1535.09 E:0.100604 |  the pitch looks OK out there, but John Stones had a little look to the floor,
[939.00 - 942.00] P:1521.53 E:0.095188 |  maybe there is a little divot out there, but the ball's just gone under his foot,
[942.00 - 944.00] P:1427.41 E:0.108380 |  that's so uncharacteristic of John Stones.
[944.00 - 949.00] P:1497.10 E:0.094861 |  Yeah, it was, and that will give confidence to Slovenia.
[949.00 - 954.00] P:1510.20 E:0.093399 |  Sheshko, now to the left-hand side where Malacca wins the throw in,
[954.00 - 959.00] P:1707.72 E:0.088646 |  and then the left flank, Sheshko tall.
[959.00 - 962.00] P:1585.24 E:0.101690 |  He's got that blonde hair, that bleach blonde hair,
[962.00 - 965.00] P:1617.57 E:0.101457 |  and he's putting himself in a position at the near post.
[965.00 - 971.00] P:1547.76 E:0.094968 |  Sheshko signed a contract to stay at Leipzig despite the interest from Arsenal.
[971.00 - 976.00] P:1567.15 E:0.096698 |  Throw-in is taken short by Slovenia out towards the left-hand side, back it goes.
[976.00 - 979.00] P:1730.75 E:0.102586 |  Here's the cross into the six-yard box, over everyone.
[979.00 - 982.00] P:1576.83 E:0.089731 |  And then Pickford came, but no-one could get a touch,
[982.00 - 984.00] P:1810.21 E:0.100792 |  and it's all the way through for a goal kick,
[984.00 - 987.00] P:1764.94 E:0.094439 |  and it is still 0-0 with 15 minutes play.
[987.00 - 990.00] P:1735.83 E:0.097795 |  Yeah, it's good marking at the back post from Trippery,
[990.00 - 993.00] P:1780.31 E:0.089914 |  he just gets in there before Shepora,
[993.00 - 995.00] P:1862.36 E:0.091464 |  he just gets his body in the way and just guides it away,
[995.00 - 998.00] P:1591.50 E:0.095696 |  and Pickford comes out, I think England got full control of that situation,
[998.00 - 1000.00] P:1660.31 E:0.103638 |  but might be better to ask an England centre-back.
[1000.00 - 1003.00] P:1687.56 E:0.090213 |  I was going to say, is he Trippery? He's the best at that, honestly.
[1003.00 - 1006.00] P:1603.04 E:0.107499 |  His dark heart with defending, the way he can get his body in,
[1006.00 - 1008.00] P:1737.58 E:0.097977 |  and just after the ball-out of play, he's the best at doing it,
[1008.00 - 1010.00] P:1637.14 E:0.094122 |  it was a fantastic bit of defending.
[1010.00 - 1015.00] P:1659.70 E:0.107421 |  Yes, that Diego Simeone, he taught him a thing or two when he was at Real Madrid.
[1015.00 - 1020.00] P:1858.04 E:0.102568 |  Trippery, now to Bellingham, and Bellingham attacks, runs with the ball at the Slovenians.
[1020.00 - 1024.00] P:1797.23 E:0.111502 |  Now Gallagher with a little touch, Saka could be on to this in the penalty area, here he is.
[1024.00 - 1027.00] P:1736.02 E:0.100413 |  Right-footed cross, though that's over, everyone's fraud and anticipated,
[1027.00 - 1030.00] P:1623.85 E:0.099094 |  though, that it was going to bounce out into the right-back area.
[1030.00 - 1034.00] P:1661.56 E:0.100715 |  And for the first time in the match, Trippery, that was a poor challenge,
[1034.00 - 1037.00] P:1744.59 E:0.105823 |  but the referee's waved the advantage.
[1037.00 - 1040.00] P:1809.37 E:0.099145 |  Spora takes it on for Slovenia down the right-hand side.
[1040.00 - 1043.00] P:1609.14 E:0.101429 |  I think there might be a yellow card coming for Kieran Trippery after that challenge,
[1043.00 - 1047.00] P:1746.04 E:0.100575 |  but still the Slovenia attack continues, Spora looks across it,
[1047.00 - 1051.00] P:1770.63 E:0.098723 |  then it's blocked out of play by Gallagher, and yeah,
[1051.00 - 1054.00] P:1762.04 E:0.106397 |  Clemente-Pan points at Kieran Trippery,
[1054.00 - 1056.00] P:1667.07 E:0.114207 |  and it's a yellow card for the England left-back.
[1056.00 - 1058.00] P:1722.65 E:0.111371 |  Yeah, it was really late for Kieran Trippery,
[1058.00 - 1061.00] P:1776.17 E:0.101861 |  he's just trying to cut off that Slovenian counterattack at source.
[1061.00 - 1065.00] P:1703.67 E:0.091353 |  But they do really well to progress the ball down this right-hand side,
[1065.00 - 1067.00] P:1435.32 E:0.093396 |  and they look like they're growing in confidence, Slovenia,
[1067.00 - 1069.00] P:1403.07 E:0.098009 |  like moving the ball about one-two touch,
[1069.00 - 1072.00] P:1536.86 E:0.101998 |  and they've got themselves in a really good position here,
[1072.00 - 1076.00] P:1606.72 E:0.103031 |  with an attacking, I think it's a throw-in on this right-hand side.
[1076.00 - 1078.00] P:1639.58 E:0.093297 |  Or is it a free kick?
[1078.00 - 1080.00] P:1647.06 E:0.115308 |  I think it is a free kick.
[1080.00 - 1083.00] P:1556.62 E:0.109662 |  It might be worth pointing out that there is a possibility
[1083.00 - 1087.00] P:1634.99 E:0.110409 |  that the places could be decided on the disciplinary ranking
[1087.00 - 1089.00] P:1570.20 E:0.107538 |  between the sides in this group,
[1089.00 - 1093.00] P:1529.03 E:0.103142 |  and Denmark, before tonight, had three yellow cards,
[1093.00 - 1099.00] P:1590.23 E:0.102103 |  and England now have two free-kick to Slovenia on the right-hand side.
[1099.00 - 1103.00] P:1538.38 E:0.093981 |  This is going to be taken by Janja, I think.
[1103.00 - 1107.00] P:1562.58 E:0.098634 |  There are two of them there, Janja and Czareen,
[1107.00 - 1110.00] P:1497.91 E:0.102778 |  but I think it looks like the in-swinger from the left-footed Janja.
[1110.00 - 1112.00] P:1339.01 E:0.099354 |  England, got to face this set piece.
[1112.00 - 1115.00] P:1635.73 E:0.114450 |  Nil Nil, if you've just joined us on five-lie here in Kulall.
[1115.00 - 1121.00] P:1609.64 E:0.109479 |  Janja waits, referee just eventually does blow his whistle.
[1121.00 - 1124.00] P:1606.52 E:0.102224 |  It is Janja left-footed towards the back post,
[1124.00 - 1127.00] P:1597.65 E:0.105262 |  and it's over everyone and all the way through beyond the far post
[1127.00 - 1129.00] P:1607.52 E:0.092966 |  on the bounce for a goal kick.
[1129.00 - 1131.00] P:1547.48 E:0.106996 |  It's a wonderful delivery from Janja.
[1131.00 - 1133.00] P:1782.57 E:0.077643 |  The left-back, he's just stepped onto the ball,
[1133.00 - 1136.00] P:1635.67 E:0.094808 |  he's hit it really cleanly, and he's got lucky.
[1138.00 - 1140.00] P:1717.53 E:0.106326 |  So it is a goal kick.
[1141.00 - 1143.00] P:1791.63 E:0.098298 |  Goal kick.
[1143.00 - 1148.00] P:1773.30 E:0.095689 |  Gay left-footed, plays it out towards Foden, a flick with Foden,
[1148.00 - 1151.00] P:1668.57 E:0.108504 |  and then Drakusic is able to play it back.
[1151.00 - 1155.00] P:1656.69 E:0.092585 |  However, so far, the most positive thing England have done
[1155.00 - 1157.00] P:1480.00 E:0.097229 |  was that run from Jude Bellingham.
[1157.00 - 1159.00] P:1519.48 E:0.097132 |  That was the first moment, really, where the crowd,
[1159.00 - 1163.00] P:1569.25 E:0.097658 |  the England supporters, got up as he ran at the Slovenians,
[1163.00 - 1167.00] P:1536.99 E:0.095285 |  and it did result in, what, a quarter chance.
[1167.00 - 1170.00] P:1638.08 E:0.095530 |  It is Elshnik for Slovenia.
[1170.00 - 1173.00] P:1416.62 E:0.089184 |  They've played it up to Spora,
[1173.00 - 1175.00] P:1678.38 E:0.109509 |  who's going to shoot from outside the penalty area,
[1175.00 - 1178.00] P:1687.63 E:0.101968 |  took a deflection, so Pickford, scrambling wide at his goal,
[1178.00 - 1180.00] P:1762.41 E:0.103459 |  was able to get down and hold it.
[1180.00 - 1182.00] P:1664.99 E:0.122146 |  Gay's gone in really well there with Spora.
[1182.00 - 1185.00] P:1709.28 E:0.091131 |  He's recognised that he's just dropped deep.
[1185.00 - 1187.00] P:1786.10 E:0.112462 |  He's tried to get the shot away.
[1187.00 - 1189.00] P:1878.84 E:0.123875 |  It was definitely not enough on it, but it was good by Gay again,
[1189.00 - 1191.00] P:1874.51 E:0.117131 |  just to get tight pressure on him.
[1193.00 - 1195.00] P:1856.46 E:0.125598 |  England nil, Slovenia nil.
[1195.00 - 1198.00] P:1894.32 E:0.106853 |  Let's see how things have started between Denmark and Serbia.
[1198.00 - 1199.00] P:1954.22 E:0.097890 |  A decent start.
[1199.00 - 1201.00] P:1747.11 E:0.107060 |  Denmark targeting, hoiling with their balls forward.
[1201.00 - 1203.00] P:1813.13 E:0.094730 |  Serbia employing the same tactic with Mitrovic.
[1203.00 - 1206.00] P:1777.24 E:0.093979 |  One of Serbia's defenders has already picked up a yellow card,
[1206.00 - 1207.00] P:1915.26 E:0.089630 |  just four minutes in.
[1207.00 - 1210.00] P:1645.76 E:0.106755 |  Milenkovic, and Barra has just had the vibe of Denmark.
[1210.00 - 1211.00] P:1795.02 E:0.090365 |  A draw could be enough for them.
[1211.00 - 1213.00] P:1754.63 E:0.079602 |  It is still nil-nil at the moment.
[1213.00 - 1215.00] P:1700.26 E:0.099855 |  It's as you were in the group.
[1215.00 - 1218.00] P:1617.49 E:0.103876 |  Yesaka playing it into Bellingham, just outside the D with his back to goal.
[1218.00 - 1221.00] P:1791.13 E:0.088555 |  Rice square, now Trippia, Trippia to Foden.
[1221.00 - 1224.00] P:1682.83 E:0.107498 |  For once, Slovenia are being pinned back into their own penalty area.
[1224.00 - 1226.00] P:1762.46 E:0.076547 |  They're just looking to get the ball up about this.
[1226.00 - 1229.00] P:1737.44 E:0.086100 |  Foden, little touch towards the corner flag, then back to Trippia on the left.
[1229.00 - 1231.00] P:1755.05 E:0.095241 |  Trippia then picks out Rice.
[1231.00 - 1233.00] P:1765.19 E:0.112343 |  Rice back to Foden in the box.
[1233.00 - 1235.00] P:1836.22 E:0.113229 |  Foden across, Saka!
[1235.00 - 1237.00] P:1747.29 E:0.114313 |  Offside flag!
[1237.00 - 1239.00] P:1716.01 E:0.103503 |  Puts it in the net with his right foot.
[1239.00 - 1242.00] P:1689.26 E:0.109626 |  It did look it, I must say.
[1242.00 - 1245.00] P:1642.75 E:0.102081 |  One or two water bottles are thrown down.
[1245.00 - 1248.00] P:1761.33 E:0.103896 |  The goal will be checked, but I think it was offside.
[1248.00 - 1250.00] P:1704.29 E:0.106937 |  What do you two think, the professionals?
[1250.00 - 1252.00] P:1704.50 E:0.105491 |  Yeah, we're just looking now.
[1252.00 - 1254.00] P:1649.38 E:0.105724 |  Foden's on the back shoulder and he is.
[1254.00 - 1257.00] P:1772.72 E:0.098796 |  He's offside, but tell you what, that's come from Declan Rice.
[1257.00 - 1260.00] P:1673.01 E:0.098675 |  Conor was asking for zip and clarity on the passing out there.
[1260.00 - 1263.00] P:1618.56 E:0.097653 |  That is a brilliant example, so unfortunate.
[1263.00 - 1265.00] P:1740.31 E:0.082545 |  That's more like it.
[1265.00 - 1268.00] P:1708.94 E:0.109266 |  You move the ball fast, I think, against the 4-4-2, a low block.
[1268.00 - 1270.00] P:1626.29 E:0.101110 |  A team who were together and in contact with each other.
[1270.00 - 1272.00] P:1701.52 E:0.105742 |  You move the ball fast, John, and it moves them.
[1272.00 - 1275.00] P:1616.79 E:0.101566 |  And this England team is capable of punching the passing in.
[1275.00 - 1278.00] P:1580.66 E:0.103427 |  That's one thing to go. When you train with them and you play with them,
[1278.00 - 1281.00] P:1476.28 E:0.098703 |  it's like pinball at times, and I think they need to get to them levels.
[1281.00 - 1285.00] P:1653.75 E:0.115334 |  20 minutes played. England 0, Slovenia 0, Euro 2024,
[1285.00 - 1288.00] P:1604.45 E:0.105405 |  on the BBC, here on 5 Live, and BBC sounds.
[1288.00 - 1292.00] P:1487.53 E:0.097046 |  And 0-0 after the concomation from VAR.
[1292.00 - 1295.00] P:1538.39 E:0.094850 |  Bellingham dived in rather there, and I think it was just as well.
[1295.00 - 1297.00] P:1492.02 E:0.095723 |  He didn't get a touch on Turin.
[1297.00 - 1302.00] P:1478.90 E:0.098724 |  Dived in with both feet on the ground, and then forward from D-all.
[1302.00 - 1304.00] P:1649.24 E:0.110314 |  Suddenly the intensity is much greater from England,
[1304.00 - 1308.00] P:1736.20 E:0.109395 |  although that's given us a foul against Walker in the centre circle.
[1308.00 - 1310.00] P:1807.67 E:0.098355 |  He just simply looked it to my eye.
[1310.00 - 1314.00] P:1707.24 E:0.106187 |  Yeah, that's just seemed to have given England a little bit of a boost.
[1314.00 - 1318.00] P:1674.36 E:0.106333 |  Ball played forward by Slovenia, but there's no way that Malacca will catch that.
[1318.00 - 1319.00] P:1798.99 E:0.107943 |  It's through for Golcic.
[1319.00 - 1321.00] P:1608.09 E:0.112624 |  Yeah, there's much more energy about it.
[1321.00 - 1324.00] P:1438.20 E:0.106748 |  We've not even mentioned Cowalker then, and he was the one that came in there
[1324.00 - 1327.00] P:1288.03 E:0.108776 |  and conceded the foul, but he went in with real intent into Malacca,
[1327.00 - 1330.00] P:1418.56 E:0.104461 |  the winger that he's up against when he came inside.
[1330.00 - 1333.00] P:1458.88 E:0.112899 |  He just went tight. He ended up giving a free kick away,
[1333.00 - 1335.00] P:1511.83 E:0.100450 |  but that's more like it for Minglen. Don't mind that at all.
[1335.00 - 1337.00] P:1648.92 E:0.105735 |  Golcic then. Pickford is going to take this.
[1337.00 - 1341.00] P:1489.10 E:0.112157 |  He's like a beacon down there, all in orange,
[1341.00 - 1344.00] P:1649.24 E:0.110906 |  almost matching the orangey sunset that we've got here tonight
[1344.00 - 1346.00] P:1672.98 E:0.097431 |  across the city of Cologne.
[1346.00 - 1349.00] P:1684.89 E:0.090321 |  Pickford left footed, high and long.
[1349.00 - 1352.00] P:1470.81 E:0.112799 |  Kane comes, tries to flick it on, but that's one well by D-all.
[1352.00 - 1357.00] P:1496.85 E:0.093326 |  Walker's able to get his foot on the ball after it was headed forward to him.
[1357.00 - 1362.00] P:1706.25 E:0.085400 |  Kyle Walker, the vice captain, winning his 86th cap tonight.
[1362.00 - 1365.00] P:1645.51 E:0.113851 |  Saka tries to get away down the left. He was pulled back there,
[1365.00 - 1368.00] P:1761.40 E:0.102689 |  and it is a yellow card to England.
[1368.00 - 1370.00] P:1797.83 E:0.117283 |  Take a quick free kick, which they wanted to do,
[1370.00 - 1375.00] P:1794.01 E:0.112414 |  but the referee says that he had not given England permission to take it.
[1375.00 - 1381.00] P:1881.48 E:0.102362 |  But that was blatant, the pullback by the left back Yanja on Saka,
[1381.00 - 1384.00] P:1647.13 E:0.096828 |  and so Saka has now got a left back on a yellow card.
[1384.00 - 1387.00] P:1725.07 E:0.096107 |  Yeah, it's brilliant play from Saka. More like it from him.
[1387.00 - 1389.00] P:1464.34 E:0.079793 |  He's off in the Premier League.
[1389.00 - 1391.00] P:1465.28 E:0.106851 |  He's one of the best at receiving the ball in tight spaces
[1391.00 - 1393.00] P:1671.07 E:0.087717 |  and getting out of trouble.
[1393.00 - 1395.00] P:1749.28 E:0.100108 |  First touch just takes him away, sucks in the foul,
[1395.00 - 1398.00] P:1488.60 E:0.102167 |  and you can feel the momentum shifting again in England's favour.
[1398.00 - 1400.00] P:1473.81 E:0.092791 |  There's a bit more bite about them now.
[1400.00 - 1403.00] P:1594.52 E:0.101364 |  And if Slovenia are able to get through,
[1403.00 - 1407.00] P:1460.99 E:0.101747 |  Yanja will be suspended for their match in the round of 16.
[1407.00 - 1411.00] P:1485.72 E:0.097865 |  But no goals yet on this final night in Group C.
[1411.00 - 1414.00] P:1387.67 E:0.101976 |  So England would be going through as group winners
[1414.00 - 1416.00] P:1535.13 E:0.095368 |  to play one of the third-place teams.
[1416.00 - 1421.00] P:1512.83 E:0.086399 |  Walk-up forward, but Gallagher was never going to reach that.
[1421.00 - 1425.00] P:1528.65 E:0.086657 |  He's scored again, Spora, once on loan at Middlesbrough.
[1425.00 - 1428.00] P:1680.80 E:0.100949 |  Andra is Spora, challenging for it.
[1428.00 - 1431.00] P:1791.75 E:0.104334 |  Walker then wins himself a throw-in on the halfway line.
[1431.00 - 1434.00] P:1681.70 E:0.111763 |  If you're out of work late and you haven't heard
[1434.00 - 1437.00] P:1534.87 E:0.113470 |  in the earlier matches, our earlier commentaries,
[1437.00 - 1440.00] P:1656.85 E:0.118175 |  it finished Austria, three Netherlands, two,
[1440.00 - 1444.00] P:1614.61 E:0.108848 |  France won, Toland won, so Austria would back Group.
[1444.00 - 1447.00] P:1674.06 E:0.104297 |  And Austria, both teams going through there,
[1447.00 - 1449.00] P:1688.92 E:0.104538 |  will play one of the runners-up.
[1449.00 - 1452.00] P:1867.16 E:0.096809 |  Austria will play the runners-up in the Portugal group
[1452.00 - 1455.00] P:1897.01 E:0.103075 |  and France the runners-up in the Belgium group.
[1455.00 - 1458.00] P:1848.78 E:0.095275 |  They'll all be decided in the coming days.
[1458.00 - 1462.00] P:1766.27 E:0.087973 |  England nil, Slovenia nil, with Gaye just turning back to Bellingham,
[1462.00 - 1465.00] P:1607.68 E:0.098732 |  who's again over towards the left-hand side,
[1465.00 - 1468.00] P:1788.74 E:0.088644 |  clearly from our position here, see the fashionable holes
[1468.00 - 1470.00] P:1610.72 E:0.101667 |  in the back of his sock.
[1470.00 - 1474.00] P:1698.48 E:0.095940 |  Walker misses the pass, nevertheless it reaches Saka on the far side,
[1474.00 - 1477.00] P:1733.09 E:0.093986 |  then in field towards Foden, Foden, past Tripier.
[1477.00 - 1480.00] P:1709.63 E:0.097898 |  Bellingham's there, just to his left, still on the left flank.
[1480.00 - 1482.00] P:1709.96 E:0.100785 |  Bellingham's ball across, took a deflection,
[1482.00 - 1485.00] P:1716.39 E:0.082466 |  was cleared away on the edge of the box.
[1485.00 - 1487.00] P:1684.61 E:0.103023 |  As Mark Gaye will go back to the goalkeeper.
[1487.00 - 1490.00] P:1774.82 E:0.119570 |  Yeah, I'm just looking at the way that England is setting up
[1490.00 - 1492.00] P:1816.93 E:0.101223 |  and the way that they're moving out of his in possession
[1492.00 - 1495.00] P:1658.35 E:0.098625 |  to try and get the likes of Bellingham and Foden on the ball.
[1495.00 - 1498.00] P:1677.73 E:0.099100 |  And they're playing some really strange passing choices.
[1498.00 - 1500.00] P:1564.47 E:0.092505 |  It's easy for us to sit up here and say that,
[1500.00 - 1506.00] P:1597.02 E:0.096494 |  but Foden, through the middle, doesn't reach Bellingham.
[1506.00 - 1511.00] P:1505.82 E:0.096403 |  So, for Akushic, who's got it in front of his own box,
[1511.00 - 1516.00] P:1539.32 E:0.110739 |  England with Foden and Tripier, but it's played.
[1516.00 - 1520.00] P:1642.05 E:0.115401 |  And in fact, cheers from the Slovenian supporters,
[1520.00 - 1523.00] P:1490.37 E:0.105535 |  as they try to play through the England press,
[1523.00 - 1526.00] P:1381.75 E:0.105476 |  but England are back in position with Saka on the far side,
[1526.00 - 1528.00] P:1466.77 E:0.115795 |  who goes down under the challenge of Janža,
[1528.00 - 1530.00] P:1532.38 E:0.114644 |  who's got to be careful there against Saka.
[1530.00 - 1534.00] P:1574.13 E:0.107429 |  He's played for it and then blasted by stones into the shins of Šesko,
[1534.00 - 1536.00] P:1492.87 E:0.108026 |  and now to play on the far side.
[1536.00 - 1538.00] P:1605.04 E:0.102779 |  He's taking a risk there, Janža.
[1538.00 - 1541.00] P:1605.63 E:0.107707 |  I was going to say, Jon, I keep on giving a ball to Bakao Saka.
[1541.00 - 1543.00] P:1614.33 E:0.101907 |  I really would. You can get at people.
[1543.00 - 1546.00] P:1552.48 E:0.106266 |  And in game management, it's understanding what the opposition are doing.
[1546.00 - 1548.00] P:1621.14 E:0.100008 |  Is anybody on a yellow card?
[1548.00 - 1550.00] P:1613.46 E:0.106577 |  A full-back on a yellow card is really dangerous
[1550.00 - 1552.00] P:1557.55 E:0.102131 |  when you've got someone running at you like Bakao Saka.
[1552.00 - 1554.00] P:1708.56 E:0.105596 |  I keep on feeding him and feeding him and feeding him
[1554.00 - 1557.00] P:1643.04 E:0.097164 |  and trying to get at him and let's see what he does with it.
[1557.00 - 1562.00] P:1829.37 E:0.100230 |  25 minutes played now as Kieran Tripier
[1562.00 - 1566.00] P:1757.61 E:0.099938 |  passes the ball over the halfway line to Phil Forder.
[1566.00 - 1568.00] P:1607.20 E:0.092849 |  Back to Tripier. Kieran again has dropped deep.
[1568.00 - 1571.00] P:1534.20 E:0.096865 |  He's now inside his own half, the England captain,
[1571.00 - 1574.00] P:1434.94 E:0.104630 |  as he just taps it back again.
[1574.00 - 1578.00] P:1556.72 E:0.109418 |  And then Kieran bring it forward, blocked out of play
[1578.00 - 1582.00] P:1475.63 E:0.107334 |  by Kieran for a throw into England just in front of the dugout.
[1582.00 - 1585.00] P:1527.52 E:0.102484 |  No sign of Garry Southgate down there,
[1585.00 - 1588.00] P:1435.03 E:0.110456 |  sitting alongside Steve Holland out of our sight.
[1588.00 - 1590.00] P:1534.55 E:0.115589 |  Under the top of the England dugout,
[1590.00 - 1593.00] P:1578.98 E:0.104055 |  which looks to me as though it's got the flag of Japan on the top of it,
[1593.00 - 1597.00] P:1511.83 E:0.098385 |  as Stones plays it to the right-hand side to Walker.
[1597.00 - 1602.00] P:1549.24 E:0.098789 |  Now to Saka. Saka just wriggles away from Janja again.
[1602.00 - 1604.00] P:1395.66 E:0.105393 |  Conor Gallagher's made himself available on the right,
[1604.00 - 1607.00] P:1618.92 E:0.097254 |  but the cover was there from Elshenik.
[1607.00 - 1611.00] P:1631.64 E:0.097433 |  And then eventually, Gallagher with Mlaka,
[1611.00 - 1615.00] P:1816.14 E:0.105227 |  and it is given as a free kick against the Slovenian midfielder.
[1615.00 - 1617.00] P:1881.44 E:0.108952 |  So a free kick won by Conor Gallagher.
[1617.00 - 1619.00] P:1902.70 E:0.105205 |  Yeah, that's what Conor Gallagher's all about.
[1619.00 - 1622.00] P:1836.19 E:0.087096 |  He picks up the loose balls, he's happy to take hits
[1622.00 - 1624.00] P:1817.39 E:0.089373 |  and just relieve a bit of pressure.
[1624.00 - 1627.00] P:1607.91 E:0.094179 |  And they've shown, Slovenia have shown some really nice little bits of link-up play.
[1627.00 - 1630.00] P:1784.83 E:0.089435 |  Playing this 4-4-2 system really nicely.
[1630.00 - 1633.00] P:1756.88 E:0.095952 |  Still 0-0, Foden now moving in field again.
[1633.00 - 1636.00] P:1696.38 E:0.106730 |  It's opening up for him to the edge of the area, plays it again,
[1636.00 - 1639.00] P:1748.55 E:0.105933 |  but Kaine was just on his heels there on the edge of the box,
[1639.00 - 1641.00] P:1859.62 E:0.093007 |  as Foden flicked it forward,
[1641.00 - 1643.00] P:1671.47 E:0.104471 |  and it just ran away from him behind for a goal kick.
[1643.00 - 1645.00] P:1730.72 E:0.090552 |  Yeah, Foden just getting on the ball,
[1645.00 - 1648.00] P:1671.46 E:0.092406 |  and he's at least the one he starts to be with there.
[1648.00 - 1651.00] P:1711.07 E:0.092930 |  He sucks the defender out, he tries to slide Harry Kaine in,
[1651.00 - 1654.00] P:1635.20 E:0.090475 |  but it's just a fraction too late from the England captain.
[1655.00 - 1658.00] P:1722.54 E:0.104677 |  So a goal kick to Slovenia,
[1658.00 - 1661.00] P:1559.43 E:0.107945 |  under the path of Walker.
[1662.00 - 1664.00] P:1616.87 E:0.100113 |  Now Bukajosaka,
[1664.00 - 1666.00] P:1606.02 E:0.094094 |  Saka back to Walker,
[1666.00 - 1668.00] P:1691.32 E:0.094877 |  and then across it comes again,
[1669.00 - 1672.00] P:1580.71 E:0.097779 |  Phil Foden, when he's received the ball, Foden,
[1672.00 - 1674.00] P:1603.42 E:0.091190 |  he's very often looked to come in field,
[1674.00 - 1677.00] P:1351.51 E:0.088661 |  and here he is now, Foden.
[1679.00 - 1682.00] P:1583.48 E:0.104582 |  Then back to Trippier, and England back into their own half,
[1682.00 - 1684.00] P:1767.92 E:0.093575 |  where Mark Gay will go back to Pickford.
[1684.00 - 1688.00] P:1867.32 E:0.106413 |  For Foden, the statistics don't look good,
[1688.00 - 1692.00] P:1825.67 E:0.105141 |  one goal and no assists in his last 15 England appearances.
[1693.00 - 1697.00] P:1761.80 E:0.099228 |  But he's always available, he's in the game,
[1697.00 - 1701.00] P:1832.28 E:0.093350 |  stones with it at the moment, plays it to his left-to-game.
[1701.00 - 1703.00] P:1677.15 E:0.102707 |  The England fans urging their team forward,
[1703.00 - 1705.00] P:1695.40 E:0.100983 |  Mark Gay is actually going to bring it forward,
[1705.00 - 1708.00] P:1736.17 E:0.091241 |  here's Declan Rice in that central position.
[1708.00 - 1711.00] P:1688.92 E:0.106578 |  Kaine available, but it goes square to Walker,
[1711.00 - 1714.00] P:1748.07 E:0.095238 |  who's come well in field, Gallagher makes a run to the right-hand side,
[1714.00 - 1717.00] P:1803.95 E:0.095802 |  Saka is there again, Saka's ball, that's more positive,
[1717.00 - 1720.00] P:1788.11 E:0.097741 |  to Kaine inside the box, try to flick it, got it all wrong.
[1720.00 - 1723.00] P:1756.18 E:0.111918 |  Bellingham wins it back on the edge of the area,
[1723.00 - 1725.00] P:1813.59 E:0.104355 |  Bellingham on his left foot, in comes the challenge on him,
[1725.00 - 1728.00] P:1791.49 E:0.110128 |  back to Rice, Rice slides in, Bellingham slides in,
[1728.00 - 1731.00] P:1728.35 E:0.120155 |  England keep possession, Trippie at Foden,
[1731.00 - 1734.00] P:1598.07 E:0.107996 |  in come the challenges, England still in possession.
[1734.00 - 1739.00] P:1719.41 E:0.090529 |  The England supporters like this, there's a bit of the traditional
[1739.00 - 1742.00] P:1849.08 E:0.101042 |  English style of football on that last period of attack,
[1742.00 - 1744.00] P:1746.19 E:0.108411 |  as Trippie out wins a throw-in,
[1744.00 - 1746.00] P:1775.50 E:0.114090 |  Off-Carny, on the left-hand side.
[1746.00 - 1749.00] P:1725.08 E:0.107653 |  Some proper hard tackling in there by Declan Rice,
[1749.00 - 1752.00] P:1737.69 E:0.097217 |  and then the tackle on Bellingham was hard but fair,
[1752.00 - 1755.00] P:1624.03 E:0.102146 |  but the England fans, as you say John, responding to that,
[1755.00 - 1758.00] P:1673.68 E:0.092508 |  they're loving it, the intensity, really lifted it.
[1758.00 - 1761.00] P:1622.43 E:0.089007 |  I can imagine them in the stands, the phrase is like,
[1761.00 - 1764.00] P:1723.91 E:0.094876 |  that's more like it, but Karnicnik is running it away,
[1764.00 - 1766.00] P:1711.08 E:0.113943 |  and England might be a little stretched here,
[1766.00 - 1768.00] P:1720.70 E:0.109573 |  Sesh goes available, the ball is played for,
[1768.00 - 1771.00] P:1690.51 E:0.104002 |  for him to chase, but Tickford will get there comfortably
[1771.00 - 1773.00] P:1769.53 E:0.115786 |  and easily first, and actually is able to pick it up
[1773.00 - 1775.00] P:1677.64 E:0.119538 |  and then underarm it out to Gallagher.
[1775.00 - 1777.00] P:1750.45 E:0.122934 |  Gallagher's got space in front of him,
[1777.00 - 1779.00] P:1610.05 E:0.115130 |  you can hear the England supporters saying,
[1779.00 - 1782.00] P:1661.91 E:0.104994 |  come on, get it forward, which is what they're doing.
[1782.00 - 1785.00] P:1742.38 E:0.104851 |  Trippie out, now Thordan, he's got two Slovenians in front of him,
[1785.00 - 1789.00] P:1685.30 E:0.094215 |  goes back to Bellingham, Trippie out, then Bellingham again,
[1789.00 - 1792.00] P:1818.84 E:0.085504 |  a flick from the right foot of Champions League winner,
[1792.00 - 1796.00] P:1663.50 E:0.097144 |  Jude Bellingham, back to Champions League winner, Kyle Walker,
[1796.00 - 1799.00] P:1689.25 E:0.098485 |  and then through the middle to Declan Rice,
[1799.00 - 1801.00] P:1708.48 E:0.109540 |  he's got space in front of him, to the edge of the box,
[1801.00 - 1803.00] P:1850.83 E:0.101775 |  Kane takes the touch, shoots on the turn,
[1803.00 - 1806.00] P:1681.14 E:0.107851 |  and then goes down a little awkwardly as it's blocked away out
[1806.00 - 1808.00] P:1681.95 E:0.096862 |  towards the left-hand side, Trippie keeps it in play,
[1808.00 - 1811.00] P:1670.01 E:0.100114 |  Thordan now, Thordan, that's a good looking ball,
[1811.00 - 1815.00] P:1740.44 E:0.119556 |  right across the penalty area, and it's lead behind at the back post
[1815.00 - 1820.00] P:1804.25 E:0.114043 |  by Janja for a first corner of the match to England.
[1820.00 - 1823.00] P:1618.82 E:0.121095 |  You can feel the energy transmitting to the fans now from England,
[1823.00 - 1827.00] P:1735.96 E:0.116742 |  they've really turned up the volume, the passing's got crisper,
[1827.00 - 1829.00] P:1750.00 E:0.114850 |  Declan Rice there couldn't believe the amount of space
[1829.00 - 1831.00] P:1887.01 E:0.112720 |  that he found himself in on the half-turn,
[1831.00 - 1833.00] P:1922.32 E:0.114631 |  and it found Harry Kane,
[1833.00 - 1836.00] P:1915.45 E:0.111083 |  and England have got that corner off that cross from Thordan.
[1836.00 - 1839.00] P:1922.79 E:0.102235 |  Yes, after what you have to say
[1839.00 - 1842.00] P:1921.28 E:0.101118 |  has been a tentative start from England,
[1842.00 - 1846.00] P:1830.06 E:0.099330 |  I think the tempo, the intensity is increasing,
[1846.00 - 1850.00] P:1825.33 E:0.092764 |  and it is getting marginally better.
[1850.00 - 1854.00] P:1820.36 E:0.096161 |  Corner from the right-hand side, the Trippie waits to take,
[1854.00 - 1858.00] P:1833.32 E:0.097222 |  the referee blows his whistle, standing just inside the box,
[1858.00 - 1861.00] P:1851.29 E:0.102838 |  Trippie just steps away to the right,
[1861.00 - 1866.00] P:1848.25 E:0.106357 |  and here we are, right footed towards the back post,
[1866.00 - 1869.00] P:1776.11 E:0.092969 |  Kane with the header, didn't get a clean contact on that,
[1869.00 - 1871.00] P:1781.90 E:0.094298 |  headed away into the full-back position,
[1871.00 - 1875.00] P:1769.36 E:0.099914 |  and then Rice challenges for it, bounces down, Rice battling for it,
[1875.00 - 1878.00] P:1792.16 E:0.112987 |  referee says, yep, that's OK, back to Kane,
[1878.00 - 1880.00] P:1829.23 E:0.107227 |  Kane shoots for Goldberg Oblak,
[1880.00 - 1882.00] P:1896.32 E:0.112579 |  is able to catch the ball in front of his eyes,
[1882.00 - 1885.00] P:1878.36 E:0.105410 |  just slightly actually for the left of his head,
[1885.00 - 1888.00] P:1826.21 E:0.100992 |  and that's England's first attempt on Gold.
[1888.00 - 1890.00] P:1766.85 E:0.094641 |  Yeah, and it was the right decision from Harry Kane,
[1890.00 - 1892.00] P:1642.05 E:0.098793 |  he's so lethal on his right foot,
[1892.00 - 1895.00] P:1651.20 E:0.112095 |  Kane from Declan Rice picking up the second phase off the corner,
[1895.00 - 1898.00] P:1527.37 E:0.105400 |  he's mopping up at the back, keeping the attack alive,
[1898.00 - 1900.00] P:1486.74 E:0.107667 |  and that's what the England fans want to see.
[1900.00 - 1902.00] P:1359.85 E:0.090019 |  Getting better, Connor?
[1902.00 - 1904.00] P:1670.12 E:0.111381 |  Yeah, a little bit of bite about England,
[1904.00 - 1906.00] P:1568.56 E:0.092168 |  I think the last five, six, seven minutes,
[1906.00 - 1908.00] P:1523.07 E:0.106113 |  I think we've sustained attacks better,
[1908.00 - 1910.00] P:1490.94 E:0.101104 |  they've had that one little counterattack,
[1910.00 - 1912.00] P:1597.28 E:0.101372 |  that pick for a come-out and collected,
[1912.00 - 1914.00] P:1619.95 E:0.095191 |  but we're just sustaining attacks better,
[1914.00 - 1916.00] P:1728.21 E:0.100778 |  a little bit more bites, a little bit more zip,
[1916.00 - 1918.00] P:1500.25 E:0.085973 |  obviously the shot from Kane,
[1918.00 - 1921.00] P:1533.30 E:0.105951 |  but just building a bit of momentum, it's better for England.
[1921.00 - 1924.00] P:1570.36 E:0.093234 |  Serbia at nil on this Tuesday night,
[1924.00 - 1926.00] P:1566.07 E:0.110161 |  and it passed them to a little short,
[1926.00 - 1929.00] P:1476.93 E:0.103246 |  Forden was almost onto that, in fact England would have won it back,
[1929.00 - 1931.00] P:1721.05 E:0.109637 |  but Kalligas headed it away to Spora,
[1931.00 - 1933.00] P:1754.62 E:0.105707 |  30 yards out, takes it on, left foot shot,
[1933.00 - 1938.00] P:1698.28 E:0.094778 |  deflected across the box, but took it away from Shesko inside the penalty area,
[1938.00 - 1942.00] P:1640.80 E:0.099969 |  and Tickford was able to collect it under no pressure,
[1942.00 - 1944.00] P:1714.75 E:0.091357 |  so still nil-nil.
[1944.00 - 1947.00] P:1709.87 E:0.099569 |  They've got a threat though, Slovenia, no question.
[1947.00 - 1949.00] P:1548.72 E:0.112286 |  They're just biting their time, Slovenia,
[1949.00 - 1951.00] P:1553.76 E:0.106967 |  two forwards are working really nicely,
[1951.00 - 1954.00] P:1545.28 E:0.103692 |  antagonistically I think is the word together,
[1954.00 - 1956.00] P:1524.72 E:0.105238 |  one's dropping deep, one's going in,
[1956.00 - 1958.00] P:1495.16 E:0.104994 |  and they're just waiting for England to make a mistake,
[1958.00 - 1960.00] P:1631.37 E:0.096930 |  and they're pouncing on it, and they look at threat.
[1960.00 - 1963.00] P:1445.52 E:0.098172 |  Spora, the number nine, who as I say,
[1963.00 - 1965.00] P:1465.88 E:0.104339 |  was at a spell on loan at Middlesbrough,
[1965.00 - 1968.00] P:1533.99 E:0.102592 |  but is now at Tannath and I, Koss and Shesko,
[1968.00 - 1970.00] P:1573.03 E:0.104509 |  who finished the season with Leipzig so well,
[1970.00 - 1974.00] P:1445.20 E:0.090420 |  scored in his last seven Premier League Bundesliga matches of the season.
[1974.00 - 1978.00] P:1384.59 E:0.098766 |  England have taken a while to create a chance,
[1978.00 - 1981.00] P:1468.10 E:0.095773 |  but Harry Kane with that shot from the edge of the penalty area there first,
[1981.00 - 1985.00] P:1632.91 E:0.097846 |  which was easily dealt with by the excellent Oblak.
[1986.00 - 1989.00] P:1781.01 E:0.098840 |  Now Gaye, England,
[1990.00 - 1993.00] P:1775.31 E:0.105957 |  look for Dallingham on the left again, back it goes to Tripier,
[1993.00 - 1998.00] P:1787.84 E:0.099295 |  then for to Kane, and then again back towards the halfway line.
[1998.00 - 2001.00] P:1812.97 E:0.087904 |  I must say this does bring it back to the last Euros,
[2001.00 - 2003.00] P:1759.58 E:0.100103 |  the third group match of England had there
[2003.00 - 2006.00] P:1740.99 E:0.093684 |  against the Czech Republic, which if you remember,
[2006.00 - 2009.00] P:1729.26 E:0.094805 |  was a bit of a tense 1-0 win,
[2009.00 - 2012.00] P:1779.06 E:0.082642 |  but England with that won the group,
[2012.00 - 2014.00] P:1823.54 E:0.106854 |  and then proceeded to reach the finals.
[2014.00 - 2017.00] P:1836.57 E:0.107328 |  So the runners-up, the last time the Euros were played in possession,
[2017.00 - 2020.00] P:1825.04 E:0.092143 |  inside the central third with Gaye,
[2020.00 - 2023.00] P:1879.65 E:0.107752 |  and Gaye looking for options, a little slipped by Foden as he comes for it.
[2023.00 - 2026.00] P:1884.46 E:0.107428 |  Gaye through the middle to Rice, then Foden, Tripier,
[2026.00 - 2029.00] P:1841.74 E:0.103103 |  Tripier expected to go forward down the left,
[2029.00 - 2031.00] P:1792.59 E:0.099926 |  but comes with the ball in field to Foden,
[2031.00 - 2033.00] P:1725.70 E:0.088781 |  Foden with a 1-2 with Dallingham,
[2033.00 - 2036.00] P:1753.82 E:0.101523 |  now Tripier on his right foot, then Rice is found space again,
[2036.00 - 2040.00] P:1678.18 E:0.096616 |  25 yards out, Rice then runs into trouble on the edge of the box,
[2040.00 - 2042.00] P:1719.78 E:0.102107 |  does well actually to get a touch to it as he fouls.
[2042.00 - 2044.00] P:1694.90 E:0.104827 |  Tripier plays it forward to Foden, he's got space,
[2044.00 - 2047.00] P:1858.45 E:0.096701 |  looks up, left foot at ball to the edge of the box,
[2047.00 - 2050.00] P:1709.01 E:0.094857 |  Walker is there, but Walker lays it off over to the far side,
[2050.00 - 2053.00] P:1748.13 E:0.096154 |  Saka, Saka has to scamper out of the penalty area,
[2053.00 - 2057.00] P:1750.00 E:0.093101 |  and then Saka to Gallagher, Saka takes it on, he's fouled,
[2057.00 - 2062.00] P:1773.54 E:0.109218 |  there's Beale, dives in on him, concedes the free kick to England,
[2062.00 - 2065.00] P:1646.01 E:0.104547 |  probably 25 yards out, given the angle towards the right.
[2065.00 - 2068.00] P:1760.99 E:0.088474 |  Saka just coming inside on that favourite left foot,
[2068.00 - 2072.00] P:1588.41 E:0.097767 |  really clever the way he uses his body, just sucks, draws the foul,
[2072.00 - 2074.00] P:1512.22 E:0.098740 |  and England have got an interesting position here,
[2074.00 - 2076.00] P:1461.25 E:0.097116 |  looks like Foden's going to go over and take it,
[2076.00 - 2079.00] P:1537.07 E:0.093479 |  a favourite left footer position.
[2079.00 - 2083.00] P:1536.49 E:0.102068 |  Strange isn't it, it does feel to me that there is an air of tension
[2083.00 - 2086.00] P:1423.17 E:0.098524 |  about this England performance,
[2086.00 - 2091.00] P:1509.76 E:0.095572 |  even though they've already secured their place in the last 16,
[2091.00 - 2096.00] P:1576.79 E:0.092208 |  you know the players know, it feels like they know that they have to deliver,
[2096.00 - 2099.00] P:1626.04 E:0.097784 |  but this is a set piece opportunity that they have here now,
[2099.00 - 2102.00] P:1700.81 E:0.113678 |  Foden has gone over there, Trippier as well,
[2102.00 - 2106.00] P:1775.82 E:0.104425 |  probably too far out to have a go,
[2106.00 - 2109.00] P:1816.68 E:0.100062 |  but Trippier just placing the ball,
[2109.00 - 2113.00] P:1765.99 E:0.102346 |  Foden, two of them in conversation together,
[2113.00 - 2118.00] P:1773.45 E:0.112362 |  still in discussions, looks as though it's going to be delivered in by Foden,
[2118.00 - 2120.00] P:1838.17 E:0.109421 |  here he comes, Phil Foden strikes it,
[2120.00 - 2122.00] P:1816.74 E:0.112681 |  goalwards and Oblak is able to move across,
[2122.00 - 2125.00] P:1834.94 E:0.110194 |  quickly enough to his left and just padded down.
[2125.00 - 2127.00] P:1709.28 E:0.112388 |  It wasn't a bad effort from Phil Foden,
[2127.00 - 2130.00] P:1736.22 E:0.097607 |  I think the position of the free kick favoured across,
[2130.00 - 2133.00] P:1782.53 E:0.101425 |  rather than a shot, nonetheless he catches it really well,
[2133.00 - 2136.00] P:1421.33 E:0.086715 |  but Oblak was equal to it,
[2136.00 - 2138.00] P:1743.13 E:0.106961 |  just watching Trippier off the transition there,
[2138.00 - 2141.00] P:1678.85 E:0.103649 |  really sharp on it, getting the team organised, that's what England need.
[2141.00 - 2145.00] P:1621.73 E:0.098481 |  Oblak launches one downfield, headed away by Gay,
[2145.00 - 2148.00] P:1647.47 E:0.095718 |  comes to Stajanovic, on the right hand side,
[2148.00 - 2151.00] P:1530.07 E:0.093897 |  Stajanovic just slips the ball down the line to Spora
[2151.00 - 2156.00] P:1751.89 E:0.096544 |  and then Gay into the challenge to win a throw in for Slovenia,
[2156.00 - 2159.00] P:1707.24 E:0.101344 |  ten yards away from the corner flag.
[2159.00 - 2165.00] P:1678.01 E:0.087452 |  Slovenia, take the throw in quickly,
[2165.00 - 2169.00] P:1702.35 E:0.097476 |  the flick in field by Turin,
[2169.00 - 2173.00] P:1522.52 E:0.103069 |  now here is the hulking figure of Dior,
[2173.00 - 2177.00] P:1547.99 E:0.103078 |  the number six who receives it back on the half-way line.
[2177.00 - 2183.00] P:1451.68 E:0.099895 |  Slovenia, never beaten England in the six previous meetings,
[2183.00 - 2185.00] P:1406.21 E:0.104301 |  one of which was in Port Elizabeth,
[2185.00 - 2188.00] P:1362.48 E:0.091125 |  at the World Cup in South Africa,
[2188.00 - 2190.00] P:1410.92 E:0.107596 |  where England went on after that,
[2190.00 - 2192.00] P:1596.31 E:0.113685 |  if you remember, to the match against Germany,
[2192.00 - 2196.00] P:1668.96 E:0.106014 |  Gallagher is challenged and Slovenia did not take advantage of that,
[2196.00 - 2200.00] P:1596.18 E:0.088110 |  there was a mix-up there between Cesko and Malacca,
[2200.00 - 2204.00] P:1570.94 E:0.097605 |  but it is Slovenia who come forward again with the ball from El Sniig,
[2204.00 - 2206.00] P:1679.07 E:0.098292 |  and now Cesko looking to find a position,
[2206.00 - 2209.00] P:1713.94 E:0.102058 |  35 yards out, rolls it to Stajanovic on the right hand side,
[2209.00 - 2212.00] P:1729.69 E:0.104103 |  Stajanovic with Konicnik, Konicnik pass to Trivia,
[2212.00 - 2214.00] P:1766.10 E:0.100738 |  Konicnik's ball to the near post,
[2214.00 - 2217.00] P:1625.33 E:0.100694 |  his block, Gay was there, Spora as well,
[2217.00 - 2219.00] P:1608.99 E:0.092504 |  and it bounce back to Trivia to clear the ball,
[2219.00 - 2221.00] P:1461.10 E:0.093387 |  back to the edge of the England penalty area,
[2221.00 - 2224.00] P:1485.31 E:0.104679 |  and then Trivia has given it away,
[2224.00 - 2227.00] P:1638.81 E:0.113667 |  Stajanovic approaches the area, there are white shirts there,
[2227.00 - 2230.00] P:1646.82 E:0.101605 |  he's forced a little wide, he uses Konicnik,
[2230.00 - 2236.00] P:1518.34 E:0.085994 |  who gives him it back, Stajanovic right corner of the box,
[2236.00 - 2238.00] P:1646.50 E:0.095791 |  and this time it's England,
[2238.00 - 2240.00] P:1629.58 E:0.115689 |  who are having to defend here,
[2240.00 - 2244.00] P:1646.23 E:0.107030 |  as the Slovenian confidence draws Konicnik,
[2244.00 - 2247.00] P:1551.64 E:0.110329 |  still 0-0 in both of these matches tonight,
[2247.00 - 2251.00] P:1416.96 E:0.109612 |  so England going through as group winners with this scoreline,
[2251.00 - 2256.00] P:1400.22 E:0.102245 |  but again, it is less than wholly convincing this England performance.
[2258.00 - 2263.00] P:1392.20 E:0.103190 |  Here's Elshnik, Elshnik moves forward,
[2263.00 - 2268.00] P:1506.07 E:0.093740 |  Saka forces him to turn it back to Drakusic on the half way line,
[2268.00 - 2272.00] P:1603.25 E:0.088102 |  then Konicnik again, Konicnik, Elshnik,
[2272.00 - 2275.00] P:1603.84 E:0.101414 |  it'll pass forward from him, then it comes back to him,
[2275.00 - 2278.00] P:1625.69 E:0.106678 |  Bellingham tries to get there, body language not great from Bellingham,
[2278.00 - 2281.00] P:1712.24 E:0.096113 |  as he doesn't get there, looks to the heavens.
[2281.00 - 2285.00] P:1565.04 E:0.090726 |  I was saying how the Slovenian strikers are working together,
[2285.00 - 2288.00] P:1462.06 E:0.094175 |  it's not the same to be said for Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham at the moment,
[2288.00 - 2291.00] P:1546.24 E:0.108082 |  they're being topped around and you can tell they're getting frustrated,
[2291.00 - 2293.00] P:1573.95 E:0.094311 |  understandably.
[2293.00 - 2296.00] P:1513.94 E:0.094390 |  Elshnik now down into the full back position,
[2296.00 - 2300.00] P:1522.20 E:0.099489 |  Stajanovic, this is good from Slovenia,
[2300.00 - 2305.00] P:1455.01 E:0.100479 |  they sense that there is this vulnerability about England.
[2305.00 - 2308.00] P:1755.57 E:0.116124 |  Šporra, Vektikonicnik, now it's taken up,
[2308.00 - 2312.00] P:1680.72 E:0.113726 |  certainly by Čareem, the Slovenian supporters, roaring on their team,
[2312.00 - 2314.00] P:1692.24 E:0.103760 |  Stajanovic is called Čareem with the cross,
[2314.00 - 2317.00] P:1696.14 E:0.095994 |  high towards the back post, it's very congested there,
[2317.00 - 2320.00] P:1760.18 E:0.120415 |  Saka leans into his opponent who goes down,
[2320.00 - 2322.00] P:1885.91 E:0.113479 |  Malaka went down far too easily,
[2322.00 - 2324.00] P:1916.82 E:0.117936 |  the Slovenians are appealing for a penalty,
[2324.00 - 2326.00] P:1888.00 E:0.118262 |  I think they'll be very fortunate,
[2326.00 - 2328.00] P:1851.60 E:0.110400 |  and then Harry Kane is felled from behind by Bial,
[2328.00 - 2330.00] P:1905.34 E:0.112339 |  which is far from his first fell,
[2330.00 - 2332.00] P:1940.95 E:0.116279 |  and the England captain has stayed down.
[2332.00 - 2334.00] P:1894.75 E:0.110219 |  Yeah, there's two bits in there to dissect,
[2334.00 - 2337.00] P:1916.87 E:0.113914 |  one the defensive responsibilities from Bakao,
[2337.00 - 2339.00] P:1912.10 E:0.103945 |  we're just watching a replay,
[2339.00 - 2341.00] P:1886.12 E:0.103545 |  he's gone down far too easily from Janza,
[2341.00 - 2343.00] P:1850.98 E:0.101844 |  it's not a foul, Saka's done really well,
[2343.00 - 2345.00] P:1680.20 E:0.109210 |  and then that one on Harry Kane, by the way,
[2345.00 - 2347.00] P:1713.33 E:0.098452 |  Afanasi-Elecard from Bial,
[2347.00 - 2349.00] P:1663.97 E:0.096842 |  the centre-back who's gone right in with him,
[2349.00 - 2351.00] P:1696.53 E:0.070708 |  gone through the back of him.
[2351.00 - 2353.00] P:1689.98 E:0.090199 |  Me too.
[2353.00 - 2357.00] P:1781.33 E:0.097414 |  And Harry Kane is on his feet now,
[2357.00 - 2359.00] P:1784.04 E:0.099544 |  and Harry Kane trotting towards Referee Töpan,
[2359.00 - 2362.00] P:1561.82 E:0.080617 |  and I think he's making the same point as the captain.
[2362.00 - 2367.00] P:1644.32 E:0.086644 |  What about a booking for Bial for that?
[2367.00 - 2369.00] P:1779.28 E:0.089428 |  Gay hits this long pass downfield,
[2369.00 - 2371.00] P:1548.98 E:0.101023 |  I'm not sure Bellingen will get there,
[2371.00 - 2373.00] P:1702.21 E:0.106604 |  he doesn't and Bellingen drops down and slides through,
[2373.00 - 2375.00] P:1644.12 E:0.100133 |  actually on his knees,
[2375.00 - 2377.00] P:1577.63 E:0.104157 |  he then stands and plows back towards the England players
[2377.00 - 2379.00] P:1605.58 E:0.102097 |  on the halfway line for the intent.
[2379.00 - 2381.00] P:1509.03 E:0.098610 |  Conor, have you put in that challenge
[2381.00 - 2383.00] P:1566.58 E:0.104380 |  that Bial had on Harry Kane?
[2383.00 - 2386.00] P:1520.83 E:0.099226 |  I'd have been booked, 100% I'd have been booked.
[2386.00 - 2388.00] P:1582.00 E:0.102677 |  It was a book, the second one he got away
[2388.00 - 2390.00] P:1577.83 E:0.107668 |  we were on the edge of the box as well,
[2390.00 - 2392.00] P:1547.84 E:0.107815 |  when Phil Fould, nice free kick.
[2392.00 - 2394.00] P:1511.86 E:0.104864 |  We're in our final fade, we seem a little bit passive,
[2394.00 - 2396.00] P:1662.14 E:0.109604 |  we seem a little bit passive,
[2396.00 - 2398.00] P:1617.00 E:0.098296 |  we get into the byline a little bit too easy
[2398.00 - 2400.00] P:1498.69 E:0.108789 |  in that little pattern of play there,
[2400.00 - 2403.00] P:1561.69 E:0.108275 |  we rescued it, but can we be a little bit more aggressive?
[2403.00 - 2405.00] P:1545.30 E:0.079288 |  Can we make contact on the play-roader, man?
[2405.00 - 2408.00] P:1673.11 E:0.098593 |  Yeah, there's trivia heads back to Pickford.
[2408.00 - 2410.00] P:1745.33 E:0.102866 |  And the shout for the penalty from Slovenia,
[2410.00 - 2413.00] P:1729.07 E:0.094477 |  I mean, Saka had his arms around Janja,
[2413.00 - 2416.00] P:1718.07 E:0.091159 |  but I think released his hands at the crucial moment.
[2416.00 - 2418.00] P:1743.54 E:0.098994 |  It's a great bit of defending,
[2418.00 - 2420.00] P:1752.69 E:0.094738 |  it's exactly what you want from your winger,
[2420.00 - 2422.00] P:1688.59 E:0.098364 |  coming back in, helping you back four,
[2422.00 - 2424.00] P:1671.65 E:0.090401 |  well done, well done Bukhaj,
[2424.00 - 2426.00] P:1769.86 E:0.075985 |  brilliant defender, mate.
[2426.00 - 2428.00] P:1827.16 E:0.104281 |  So England, play it forward, half-time approaching,
[2428.00 - 2430.00] P:1883.20 E:0.098176 |  0-0 in both matches this final night in Group C.
[2430.00 - 2432.00] P:1908.84 E:0.100277 |  Five life from the BBC,
[2432.00 - 2435.00] P:1891.03 E:0.100849 |  flood lights just beginning to take greater effect
[2435.00 - 2438.00] P:1872.72 E:0.089548 |  down there on the pitch surface, Foden.
[2438.00 - 2441.00] P:1845.45 E:0.098809 |  Then Stones from his Manchester City team there,
[2441.00 - 2444.00] P:1785.14 E:0.094555 |  flick from Trippia, Dalingham's able to get the ball down
[2444.00 - 2447.00] P:1755.45 E:0.090841 |  on ground level, and then takes on the two Slovenians,
[2447.00 - 2450.00] P:1729.22 E:0.099964 |  plays it back to Trippia, Trippia on his right foot.
[2450.00 - 2455.36] P:1762.17 E:0.104138 |  from Trippie at the back post and it just evades both Gallagher and the sliding Kane
[2456.24 - 2460.48] P:1693.24 E:0.114706 |  and skips away beyond the far post for a goal kick. It's taken 40 minutes for us down this
[2460.48 - 2466.40] P:1655.71 E:0.107136 |  left-hand side to find Keir and Trippie in his strongest position, cutting on to his right
[2466.40 - 2470.24] P:1591.17 E:0.102683 |  and he whips the most delightful ball into the backstick area and Harry Kane must have been
[2470.24 - 2474.48] P:1563.65 E:0.103850 |  inches away from that. He was, we're watching the replay there but that ball in from Trippie,
[2474.48 - 2479.76] P:1705.41 E:0.102766 |  exceptional. It's an outstanding ball, John, outstanding. Keir and Trippie
[2479.76 - 2483.52] P:1600.14 E:0.106379 |  has got that in his locker-ball away. We see it every single week at Newcastle from the right-hand
[2483.52 - 2488.64] P:1689.63 E:0.100531 |  side. He just put it onto his right foot and whipped a lovely ball in. All it needed was a little,
[2488.64 - 2498.24] P:1583.84 E:0.080956 |  little touch and it'll go into the bottom corner. But it remains 0-0 and Mark Gay gets very tight on
[2498.24 - 2504.56] P:1590.66 E:0.094686 |  Sporagh down in the halfway line, way down below us. Have to lean over the front of the desk to see him.
[2505.04 - 2509.12] P:1639.48 E:0.104216 |  Sheshko and then Karnicnik with a ball into the edge of the arrow. Walker's got to be careful,
[2509.12 - 2513.28] P:1627.75 E:0.095064 |  quickly plays it back to Pickford. He was under pressure there, Walker, on the edge of the area.
[2513.28 - 2519.20] P:1750.69 E:0.098250 |  It was a sure touch. You got that just about right. Yeah, he did and I'm just watching Pickford and
[2519.20 - 2522.64] P:1772.64 E:0.089326 |  Walker. Walker's just clapped Pickford because Walker deals with it really well. He fizzes a
[2522.64 - 2526.72] P:1787.32 E:0.089368 |  pass into Pickford and he has to deal with it first time otherwise he's under pressure
[2526.72 - 2531.36] P:1823.37 E:0.106267 |  but they ended up dealing with it really well England. Well, it's been an ultra low-scoring
[2531.92 - 2542.16] P:1677.52 E:0.094635 |  group this one. 1-1-1-1. 1-0-1-1. And this last night of the group has them both at 0-0.
[2542.96 - 2552.40] P:1629.74 E:0.089090 |  Here is Jude Dillingham. Dillingham to Folden. Now back to Gay. In England again,
[2552.40 - 2557.36] P:1578.24 E:0.105105 |  Conor Gallagher makes himself available but instead it goes to Rice, Declan Rice.
[2557.44 - 2560.72] P:1516.10 E:0.106406 |  Gay and the England supporters. You can hear them from the stands. There are so many of them,
[2560.72 - 2565.44] P:1362.10 E:0.109265 |  almost 20,000 of them in this stadium. Whenever England are in a position where they could drive
[2565.44 - 2570.40] P:1390.42 E:0.106487 |  forward there is that encouragement from the stands and here it comes again. Rice though has
[2570.40 - 2577.76] P:1407.99 E:0.102195 |  to go back to the halfway line. Two John Stones and then Harry Kane. Once more drops deep.
[2579.44 - 2584.96] P:1613.74 E:0.114310 |  Stones to Kane who turns now that he odds out. Kane's going to try shot which is deflected up
[2585.12 - 2589.60] P:1664.55 E:0.113010 |  and wide. Luke's away to Conor for England. Don't mind that. The obvious pass for England is to
[2589.60 - 2593.92] P:1504.55 E:0.112320 |  play sideways but what they've started to do in the last five or ten minutes, they've started to
[2593.92 - 2598.80] P:1508.35 E:0.117016 |  pierce through Slovenia's midfield. They're getting Harry Kane, Declan Rice on the half-turn and then
[2598.80 - 2602.56] P:1564.91 E:0.104632 |  they're just going for the throat of Slovenia and they've got a couple of corners as a result.
[2602.56 - 2608.72] P:1627.78 E:0.099391 |  It's much better from them. Simple. So Trebja goes across there to take this. Luke Shaw is named
[2608.72 - 2613.20] P:1643.01 E:0.101411 |  as a substitute by the way tonight. He was involved in the warm-up but Garry Southgate said he won't
[2613.60 - 2620.24] P:1824.47 E:0.104234 |  be on the field tonight but that is more promising. Here's the corner then. Trebja drives it deep.
[2620.24 - 2624.24] P:1690.56 E:0.105072 |  Rice trying to get to it. There's Defender there in the referee says there was a shove in the back
[2624.24 - 2631.12] P:1702.86 E:0.089522 |  on Cherine by Rice. So it's a free kick and Beal gives him a little hug for winning the free kick.
[2631.12 - 2640.08] P:1596.14 E:0.088335 |  Free kick to to Slovenia. So nil nil in both matches and Oblak who's not being stretched. It has to
[2640.08 - 2646.80] P:1473.82 E:0.099220 |  be said he's had a couple of stops to make but for goalkeeper at his level they were very straightforward
[2647.52 - 2652.80] P:1520.96 E:0.108662 |  and Oblak with the orange gloves and the orange boots strikes us over the halfway line. It bounces
[2652.80 - 2660.48] P:1499.70 E:0.101200 |  down for Trebja and then Trebja all the way back to goalkeeper Pitford who will give it back to Trebja.
[2661.52 - 2665.84] P:1578.61 E:0.101930 |  That's what England want to see just as Izzy Christensen described there. To be able to find
[2665.84 - 2670.56] P:1584.63 E:0.096178 |  a position where Trebja can deliver balls into the penalty area from open play. Walker
[2671.36 - 2676.40] P:1761.23 E:0.098743 |  then Gallagher. What do you think of Gallagher so far Izzy? It's been energetic. He's made a few
[2676.40 - 2681.12] P:1873.46 E:0.105559 |  good forward runs which we haven't mentioned off the ball but I've noticed him. He's doing it to
[2681.12 - 2685.36] P:1909.33 E:0.110897 |  create space for the team but I think it's been a few sloppy little bits of play in the midfield
[2685.36 - 2691.68] P:1827.52 E:0.099663 |  for him. He's on the ball now. First time he started a match at a major tournament. There's an unused
[2691.68 - 2698.72] P:1809.58 E:0.095967 |  substitute for all of the matches in Qatar. He has game not game on the halfway line but
[2698.72 - 2704.88] P:1791.59 E:0.092525 |  Slovenia just happy to sit off behind the ball with this score line Slovenia would be would be
[2704.88 - 2711.28] P:1792.62 E:0.094564 |  risking it in terms of the the places but I think they're probably confident enough that three points
[2711.28 - 2719.84] P:1868.77 E:0.101551 |  will get them through. Here is again. Stones. Stones is saying the game. You know there's body
[2719.84 - 2725.68] P:1793.69 E:0.103861 |  language again out there between the players as Foden brings it in field of rice. Rice goes for the
[2725.68 - 2731.68] P:1786.79 E:0.092013 |  long pass. Walker has to back away not a ball back to Saka. He gets there first ahead of Mlaka.
[2732.32 - 2738.08] P:1705.11 E:0.103718 |  Saka against Mlaka. Saka's ball into the area to Bellingham. A flick from him in between Saka
[2738.08 - 2744.72] P:1687.76 E:0.100113 |  and Foden and it breaks down. Just doesn't click for Infen. It's been the story hasn't it?
[2744.72 - 2746.88] P:1645.86 E:0.094570 |  That's what we're waiting for. We're just waiting for that
[2748.96 - 2753.12] P:1728.66 E:0.104133 |  piece of quality. That's far like Sejong. Yeah, piece of quality and there are plenty of players down
[2753.12 - 2761.28] P:1694.98 E:0.097737 |  there who are good enough to provide it as the referee has blown for half time. 45 minutes are
[2761.28 - 2769.04] P:1700.74 E:0.101814 |  up. He's played five seconds over the 45. So what do we make of that? 0-0 with Slovenia at half time.
[2769.04 - 2773.12] P:1516.21 E:0.102515 |  Is he Connor? I think if I'm honest I think we were expecting a little bit more of a response
[2773.12 - 2778.32] P:1523.45 E:0.102473 |  from England to the previous two performances in the group. But they've just not quite found that
[2778.32 - 2781.44] P:1374.57 E:0.105279 |  cutting edge yet to cut through Slovenia who have been magnificent by the way. They've been
[2781.44 - 2784.88] P:1567.12 E:0.100745 |  structured disciplined haven't they Connor? Yeah, they have isn't. Do you know what? It seems a bit
[2784.88 - 2789.04] P:1534.47 E:0.105264 |  like an anxious performance from England. They get into the final 30 in our own final 30. It's a
[2789.04 - 2792.80] P:1435.23 E:0.101966 |  little bit anxious. I don't know whether it's the crowd and the anxiety in the crowd and then the
[2792.80 - 2796.40] P:1589.22 E:0.096474 |  players and a few little mistakes here and there. I think we have a little bit more quality going
[2796.40 - 2799.68] P:1564.54 E:0.099784 |  forward. We mentioned in comments today we're busy about just being a little bit quicker when you're
[2799.76 - 2803.84] P:1536.43 E:0.097825 |  passing. A little bit zippier. Just a little bit more coming over the second half and try and get
[2803.84 - 2809.04] P:1463.79 E:0.094300 |  away from the anxiety that we've got about us at the minute. Yep, they promised more. Really,
[2809.04 - 2813.44] P:1629.47 E:0.096278 |  they've yet to deliver it. Kane with a shot that was comfortably saved. Fung with a free kick.
[2813.44 - 2820.08] P:1571.76 E:0.091853 |  That ball in from Trippian. Slovenia carry a threat but at halftime England nil. Slovenia nil
[2820.08 - 2826.96] P:1526.79 E:0.090827 |  and Mark Chapman's up here with us. Can I focus on the two flags? And I'll start with you Connor on
[2827.76 - 2833.68] P:1739.18 E:0.081347 |  the right flank, which is, as you said, midway through the first half. Get the ball to it. Get
[2833.68 - 2838.88] P:1632.26 E:0.086478 |  the ball to sack it. He is the one that he's going to run at them. That's exactly what I'll be saying
[2838.88 - 2843.04] P:1637.79 E:0.087343 |  on the pitch. Chappers and I think it's, it's up to players on the pitch then to take responsibility
[2843.04 - 2846.88] P:1691.66 E:0.095934 |  and say, listen, game management, let's see what they've got. Let's see what Slovenia have got.
[2846.88 - 2850.32] P:1810.18 E:0.088926 |  Right, we've got one of the fastest wingers in the competition. He's had an outstanding season.
[2850.32 - 2853.84] P:1783.74 E:0.091990 |  I'll give him the ball, get down the outside. Like the goal in the first game against Sabia,
[2853.84 - 2858.80] P:1739.50 E:0.093647 |  he's got a bit of a spin there. He's got a bit of a spin there. I know it takes the deflection
[2858.80 - 2862.32] P:1663.52 E:0.084936 |  on to Jude Bellingham's head against Sabia, but he's down the outside. He's getting a ball in with
[2862.32 - 2866.32] P:1734.33 E:0.063126 |  his right foot. At the minute, we're always coming inside. We're coming inside. We're coming inside.
[2866.88 - 2874.80] P:1729.19 E:0.081863 |  And on the left, I feel a bit fulfilled, Foden, actually, because he has had a bit of a spark
[2874.80 - 2879.68] P:1786.87 E:0.090238 |  and anything he's tried, it doesn't feel like anybody else is on his wavelength.
[2879.68 - 2882.88] P:1598.29 E:0.083678 |  But I think that's the reason why Jude Bellingham is coming over onto this left hand side as well as Foden.
[2882.88 - 2886.64] P:1692.55 E:0.096255 |  They're obviously trying to get them tight together to combine, to create the overload,
[2886.64 - 2891.92] P:1770.76 E:0.086009 |  to then pierce through Slovenia's defense. I have no issue with that as long as it's got rhythm,
[2891.92 - 2896.72] P:1646.42 E:0.091503 |  as long as it's got intent. And I think the movement between the two of them has just been a little bit delayed
[2896.72 - 2901.84] P:1774.92 E:0.087304 |  and the passing opportunity has gone. But the other thing with Tripp here is obviously he's a right footed
[2901.84 - 2906.64] P:1691.34 E:0.090545 |  left back at the moment. I have no problem with him playing there if you use his strengths.
[2906.64 - 2910.40] P:1640.96 E:0.095918 |  And they've shown there, England, that one chance that Harry Kane was about an inch away
[2910.40 - 2914.48] P:1672.96 E:0.093066 |  from putting in the back of the net. That's using Tripp's strength in a position which isn't his most
[2914.48 - 2918.48] P:1697.59 E:0.093806 |  favoured position. But it's just about finding the right relationships around the ball. And if I'm
[2918.48 - 2923.04] P:1702.70 E:0.086853 |  honest, I don't think it's working on this left hand side. Do you think Bellingham's body language
[2923.04 - 2928.00] P:1759.34 E:0.088518 |  is great? I mean, I don't want to go back to it, but it was highlighted in the last game.
[2928.00 - 2934.56] P:1723.35 E:0.091077 |  He did applaud the long ball from Mark Gay. There's a lot of shrugging, huffing, hands out.
[2935.36 - 2940.72] P:1726.13 E:0.087875 |  Why wasn't that laid back to me? The intent is there from Bellingham at times. I wouldn't say
[2940.72 - 2945.44] P:1659.99 E:0.089993 |  it's been consistent. As in he's made the runs beyond, which is what number 10 should be doing.
[2945.44 - 2949.44] P:1697.19 E:0.096203 |  They should be creating space. But I think that the body language you're referring to is coming
[2949.44 - 2953.76] P:1667.26 E:0.089341 |  from the press. Slovenia have looked really comfortable playing out of England's press with
[2953.76 - 2957.76] P:1700.64 E:0.095582 |  with Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham as a two up there. They're just not getting close enough.
[2957.76 - 2961.12] P:1752.04 E:0.087629 |  And that's why Bellingham is getting frustrated. Yeah, it's frustrating, I think, Chappell as
[2961.12 - 2965.60] P:1676.44 E:0.094100 |  well. I think it's frustrating. We're a little bit slower, a little bit lethargic. And I just
[2965.60 - 2969.52] P:1744.02 E:0.096311 |  think it's frustration from Jude. Listen, the bigger things we can look at at this moment.
[2969.52 - 2972.40] P:1711.62 E:0.090445 |  And I actually think I mentioned before again about Declan Rice being big. I actually think
[2972.40 - 2975.12] P:1686.96 E:0.089083 |  he's going to be big in this game without touching the ball that much. I think our centre
[2975.12 - 2977.68] P:1626.55 E:0.097051 |  are asking Steppenmore. They're playing with the two and they're trying to stop Declan get on the
[2977.68 - 2981.68] P:1744.20 E:0.090036 |  ball. So Declan has to move their two strikers because we have two fantastic players at centre
[2981.68 - 2984.72] P:1627.86 E:0.088835 |  back who can step in with the ball. So I think Declan's going to be big in this, getting on the
[2984.72 - 2988.88] P:1787.22 E:0.089999 |  ball when we can, of course. But then when we can't, go and occupy defenders and let us step out in
[2988.88 - 2992.88] P:1754.30 E:0.101351 |  the way. Joe Hart and our studio in Berlin. What have you made of that first 45?
[2993.52 - 2998.56] P:1752.83 E:0.108165 |  Yeah, it just felt a little bit clunky, especially when we're talking about our left side with Jude
[2998.56 - 3003.28] P:1636.50 E:0.103947 |  Bellingham dropping into the kind of left back position here in Trippier. Not quite sure what,
[3003.84 - 3008.64] P:1755.04 E:0.109046 |  when to go, when not to go and Phil Foden, obviously, you can tell that he really wants to make an
[3008.64 - 3013.68] P:1569.83 E:0.098404 |  impact on this game. But, you know, as he said, when he does try and make that impact, not everyone's
[3013.68 - 3018.00] P:1687.96 E:0.101616 |  quite on his wavelength. So I concur with what all you guys are saying. I'm just interested.
[3018.08 - 3022.96] P:1663.14 E:0.097031 |  How's the pitch looking? Because I know that Slovenia aren't necessarily playing
[3022.96 - 3027.04] P:1711.36 E:0.099115 |  slick football, but when they do play, they look quite comfortable in what they're trying to do.
[3027.04 - 3031.20] P:1611.77 E:0.105160 |  But England, they look like a second guess in their simple passes at the moment, and they're
[3031.20 - 3037.92] P:1693.17 E:0.093828 |  not quite sure of the tempo to pass at. Pitch is looking fine to me. Really?
[3038.64 - 3043.28] P:1637.56 E:0.088747 |  Yeah, there was that pass that John Stones, the ball went under his foot and he looked at the
[3043.28 - 3047.52] P:1599.62 E:0.093788 |  turf as if to say it took a bubble. I didn't see it again. I didn't see it close enough. But
[3048.00 - 3053.04] P:1593.89 E:0.096956 |  from my angle, if Slovenia can play, so can England and kind of said it's spot on, absolutely spot
[3053.04 - 3058.08] P:1699.43 E:0.094161 |  on, they just need to move the ball quicker, visit in, get some more rhythm on the ball because
[3058.08 - 3063.28] P:1667.30 E:0.098502 |  Slovenia are just so happy sitting off, aren't they? Yeah, I'd say there's no set tempo to how
[3063.28 - 3068.00] P:1614.63 E:0.099802 |  we're playing. And when a team that wants to play and break through lines, you know, even
[3068.00 - 3071.92] P:1679.75 E:0.104025 |  sometimes we all miss a pass. That's not a problem. It's just I'm not quite sure of the tempo,
[3071.92 - 3077.20] P:1697.70 E:0.095036 |  you know, and it almost looks completely different from the right side, how the pace we're trying
[3077.20 - 3080.96] P:1688.70 E:0.094953 |  to build up to the left hand side. Party. We've all been there, haven't we? You know, we're confidence,
[3080.96 - 3084.16] P:1674.16 E:0.095505 |  mate. I think it's something where we can talk about the pitch, we can talk about the things
[3084.16 - 3087.04] P:1722.75 E:0.086720 |  I want. I actually think there's a lack of confidence a little bit with England. I think
[3087.04 - 3090.72] P:1744.07 E:0.096287 |  you can say what you want over the last few days about the not felt it. But you do, we've been there,
[3090.72 - 3094.24] P:1776.35 E:0.101530 |  haven't we, where you're here, thinking you see it. Of course you do. And there is an anxiety when
[3094.24 - 3097.60] P:1741.22 E:0.092109 |  the ball's coming into our own final third. So I do think it's a confidence thing. We've got to be
[3097.60 - 3101.44] P:1751.58 E:0.095650 |  brave enough and strong enough to get through it. And I think actually, Slovenia are playing quite
[3101.44 - 3105.04] P:1764.72 E:0.097055 |  well. So we've got to get through it and be strong enough to come through it. They have played quite
[3105.04 - 3108.88] P:1720.14 E:0.100825 |  well, haven't they? I'm there, Joe Slovenia. But when England are on the front foot, when they have
[3108.88 - 3113.04] P:1775.77 E:0.095541 |  driven at them those two or three times, and when they have played the pass to break the line,
[3113.04 - 3119.12] P:1770.33 E:0.091544 |  rather go side to side, they've been effective. Yeah, I think Slovenia have fed off our energy,
[3119.12 - 3123.04] P:1692.77 E:0.102742 |  and they've probably fed off everything going into this week, feeling no in full well what
[3123.04 - 3128.00] P:1719.06 E:0.097022 |  noise has been going on from the country and how the boys have been reacting to it. And I was just
[3128.00 - 3132.48] P:1822.16 E:0.102927 |  thinking before about this tournament, obviously, being so close and, you know, no games really,
[3132.56 - 3136.32] P:1578.19 E:0.104172 |  anyone's been blown away. You're not beating anyone in the tunnel at this tournament, are you?
[3136.32 - 3139.04] P:1714.77 E:0.107442 |  You're not standing there and having the opposition look at you and think,
[3139.04 - 3143.04] P:1678.99 E:0.106274 |  this is going to be a long day. I think at the moment, people have got the attitude of, you know
[3143.04 - 3147.68] P:1520.88 E:0.098473 |  what, if we can really get into these guys, we can unsettle them. And I think Slovenia, like we say,
[3147.68 - 3151.20] P:1581.50 E:0.089016 |  we've got to give credit. They've made it really difficult tonight, and they actually look a threat
[3151.20 - 3156.72] P:1681.73 E:0.101379 |  when they go forward. Joe Hart, Izzy Krishnis and Conor Cody with us this evening. Goal is here
[3156.72 - 3161.28] P:1728.84 E:0.097083 |  between England and Slovenia. And then the other match in the group, Maz Farouki. Yeah, this one
[3161.28 - 3165.84] P:1315.23 E:0.102815 |  hasn't sparkled really very much either, Mark. This one also goalless. Jonas Fin has had the ball
[3165.84 - 3170.40] P:1619.97 E:0.092508 |  in the back of the Serbia net, but to say he was wrestling Rykovich, the Serbia keeper to the ground
[3170.40 - 3174.64] P:1686.13 E:0.086435 |  as Ericsson swept the corner kick in. Will be an understatement. Ericsson has had a couple of
[3174.64 - 3179.68] P:1749.75 E:0.086106 |  chances testing the goalkeeper, taking a shot on from distance as well. And bookings, if they do
[3179.68 - 3184.08] P:1423.68 E:0.088782 |  become a factor with this group, so tight, we've had two for Denmark so far to add to John's tally,
[3184.08 - 3188.72] P:1610.44 E:0.092207 |  one for Serbia. A draw at the moment could be enough, perhaps should be enough for Denmark
[3188.72 - 3191.76] P:1504.39 E:0.083878 |  to progress, but you feel they want to try and get the job done in the second half.
[3191.76 - 3196.96] P:1492.15 E:0.086699 |  Serbia need to try and get the win. Remember, hard time in Munich and is Denmark, no Serbia, no
[3196.96 - 3202.24] P:1687.06 E:0.094749 |  second half of both games on the way during hard time. We'll discuss the fact that Austria
[3202.24 - 3207.68] P:1737.89 E:0.086139 |  have topped their group this afternoon. The French finished second. The Dutch will go through as one
[3207.68 - 3214.00] P:1568.23 E:0.103713 |  of the best third place sides. First of all, Dan Morsley in the news. The voice of the UK and the
[3214.00 - 3221.68] P:1479.17 E:0.118248 |  home of the Euros and the general election 2024. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Labour has suspended
[3221.68 - 3226.40] P:1818.84 E:0.089208 |  one of its candidates after hearing from the gambling commission that he's being investigated.
[3226.40 - 3231.68] P:1757.28 E:0.085854 |  Kevin Craig has apologised for betting that the Conservatives would win the seat that he's contesting.
[3232.24 - 3237.20] P:1831.07 E:0.088188 |  Well, the Conservatives withdrew support for two of their candidates this morning, Craig Williams
[3237.20 - 3241.60] P:1603.39 E:0.085711 |  and Laura Saunders are being looked at by the gambling watchdog for alleged bets on the data
[3241.60 - 3246.72] P:1881.07 E:0.082340 |  of the election. They've denied wrongdoing. The Metropolitan Police says five more officers
[3246.72 - 3252.00] P:1824.96 E:0.076159 |  based in Westminster are being investigated by the gambling commission for similar allegations.
[3252.00 - 3255.92] P:1541.49 E:0.085218 |  And that may not be the end of it. Here's our political editor, Chris Mason.
[3255.92 - 3259.76] P:1456.84 E:0.065035 |  Here we are so close to the election. I thought I couldn't be surprised by politics anymore.
[3259.76 - 3263.92] P:1754.99 E:0.062050 |  After what we've seen in the last couple of years, frankly, what we've seen in much of the last decade.
[3263.92 - 3269.20] P:1734.00 E:0.066389 |  And then you get days like today where we seem to be well into the kind of you couldn't make it up
[3269.20 - 3274.96] P:1763.31 E:0.050737 |  territory. And here is the thing. There is every prospect that there is more to come.
[3274.96 - 3279.52] P:1676.35 E:0.053662 |  And what are we just a week and a couple of days away from polling day? It's astonishing.
[3280.08 - 3283.68] P:1742.71 E:0.094402 |  Well, indeed, there is more to come because we are now hearing a fifth
[3283.68 - 3289.04] P:1798.87 E:0.073952 |  Conservative is being looked into by the gambling commission over a bet about the timing of the
[3289.04 - 3293.04] P:1878.26 E:0.078334 |  election. Russell George, who's a member of the Welsh Parliament has stepped back
[3293.04 - 3296.80] P:1674.76 E:0.067931 |  from his party's shadow cabinet and says he will cooperate fully.
[3297.76 - 3302.40] P:1893.90 E:0.088895 |  Police in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi have shot dead at least five people during huge
[3302.40 - 3306.96] P:1818.94 E:0.072054 |  protests against planned tax increases. The crowds broke through police
[3306.96 - 3311.60] P:1687.50 E:0.066977 |  cordons and set fire to part of the country's parliament building. About 40 people are being
[3311.60 - 3316.96] P:1856.33 E:0.081410 |  treated in hospital. And North Yorkshire police say four men have been arrested on suspicion
[3316.96 - 3322.32] P:1943.89 E:0.078887 |  of aggravated trespass at Rishi Sunak's home in Kirby-Sigston, near North Allerton. They were
[3322.32 - 3327.04] P:1790.86 E:0.078596 |  detained within a minute of entering the grounds and remain in police custody for questioning.
[3352.96 - 3370.08] P:1404.91 E:0.103367 |  England Nails, Slovenia Nails, here in Cullness, also a Denmark Nail Serbia Nail. England would go
[3370.08 - 3377.28] P:1520.07 E:0.089803 |  through as group winners. Great game earlier. Austria beat the Netherlands 3-2. So they finished
[3377.28 - 3383.68] P:1535.15 E:0.086749 |  top of group D. France drew one all with already out Poland, which means they finished second in
[3383.68 - 3389.52] P:1393.98 E:0.081276 |  the group. The Netherlands go through as a best placed third team and they could meet England,
[3389.52 - 3393.68] P:1662.60 E:0.090292 |  if England were to win the group. That's one of the possibilities now for England. But let's talk
[3393.68 - 3400.40] P:1764.84 E:0.087465 |  to what of his goalkeeper, Daniel Batman, who has got 40 caps for Austria. Evening Daniel, we spoke
[3400.40 - 3405.04] P:1790.50 E:0.099010 |  before that first game against the French and now three games later Austria go through as group
[3405.04 - 3411.68] P:1498.52 E:0.084607 |  winners. Was that how you envisaged it? Yeah, I mean it's one of those, isn't it? Before the
[3411.68 - 3417.52] P:1528.92 E:0.083033 |  Euro's when the groups came out, I don't think many people would have given Austria a really good
[3417.52 - 3421.76] P:1519.20 E:0.084306 |  chance to go through. And I don't think anyone would have thought that they could possibly top
[3421.76 - 3429.52] P:1484.66 E:0.079623 |  that group. So it obviously speaks for the work that Proudfranek's done and also for the effort
[3429.52 - 3434.32] P:1600.96 E:0.084103 |  the players have put in. They've just played some really good stuff in all three games, even in the
[3434.32 - 3440.32] P:1577.92 E:0.085281 |  defeat to the French, they caused the French some problems. And the Poland game was fantastic. And
[3440.32 - 3448.56] P:1487.70 E:0.085980 |  today? Yeah, I think the French result was a bit harsh in the end really because other than the
[3448.56 - 3453.36] P:1500.88 E:0.083000 |  chance in the second half that Bapu missed when he was through on goal, I don't think they had any
[3453.36 - 3458.08] P:1532.81 E:0.085168 |  other clear cut chances. Austria obviously had a massive one just before France scored the goal.
[3459.04 - 3462.88] P:1645.60 E:0.090201 |  If Austria scored that, you know, it's probably a different outcome to the game as well. So
[3464.80 - 3470.72] P:1651.94 E:0.083550 |  given France a really good game, obviously I wouldn't say battered Poland, but they gave
[3470.72 - 3476.96] P:1609.24 E:0.087360 |  them a good seeing to. And then obviously today again against the top team, like we spoke a few
[3476.96 - 3482.64] P:1660.72 E:0.090811 |  days ago, obviously they beat Germany not that long ago and then another big sculpt for them today,
[3483.36 - 3488.80] P:1717.64 E:0.084741 |  going into the round of 16 as a group and as one of the toughest groups at a championship.
[3489.36 - 3496.72] P:1617.56 E:0.077554 |  Do you think they do you think people now treat them differently? And how do you think that will
[3496.72 - 3503.92] P:1585.04 E:0.079960 |  affect them as a group? Because it can't be dark horses anymore. Can they? No, I just think I don't
[3503.92 - 3509.76] P:1627.24 E:0.080149 |  think it'll affect the players at all. I just think because of the way they play, their best
[3509.76 - 3514.96] P:1578.72 E:0.081586 |  attribute is the pressing and the high intensity. So there's not too much that can go wrong when it
[3514.96 - 3518.40] P:1548.05 E:0.083033 |  comes to the playing with the ball. And obviously they've got quality players and they play some
[3518.40 - 3524.48] P:1767.73 E:0.074232 |  great football. But the biggest problems for the opposition teams is the high intensity and the
[3524.48 - 3533.12] P:1714.42 E:0.080036 |  pressing. So that's not really something that can be changed by pressure or by having a different
[3534.96 - 3540.00] P:1671.00 E:0.085032 |  goal now. You know, now you're out of the group stage with such an impressive run of games as well.
[3540.72 - 3545.36] P:1512.15 E:0.083088 |  I don't think that that'll phase them at all, regardless of what's obviously coming from the
[3545.36 - 3549.92] P:1583.12 E:0.091608 |  press. And of course, there'll be conversations. I mean, I don't know if they could go all the way,
[3550.80 - 3555.84] P:1697.33 E:0.080601 |  which I think they can. It's early to say, but just from watching the three group games,
[3556.40 - 3561.36] P:1613.64 E:0.084228 |  I don't think any team will want to play them. Just a final one on it as well. And I think this,
[3561.36 - 3568.96] P:1533.66 E:0.079453 |  while Ralph Ragnick has said this, they don't play until July the second in Leipzig. So July
[3568.96 - 3574.88] P:1696.29 E:0.081605 |  the second is next Tuesday, I think. So they've got a week to prepare for their last 16 game.
[3574.96 - 3580.32] P:1707.47 E:0.082757 |  But given how he works them, given the plans, given the fitness, that gap is huge for them.
[3582.32 - 3587.20] P:1636.72 E:0.097855 |  Yes, it's massive for them. I mean, I think he made a few changes today on the game. He's obviously
[3587.20 - 3592.80] P:1765.30 E:0.088107 |  arrested a couple of players. And now, like you say, he's got full week for them to recover because
[3592.80 - 3598.08] P:1786.45 E:0.081232 |  the way they play is intense and it is incredibly hard work. And you have to be incredibly fit
[3598.08 - 3603.28] P:1770.63 E:0.085214 |  to be a starter in a team or to be involved in that team as an outfield player. So to have that
[3603.28 - 3608.72] P:1666.21 E:0.084554 |  extra week now, that full week of recovery before the last 16 game, was to send them in really
[3608.72 - 3615.04] P:1803.32 E:0.081887 |  good stead going forward just because of the way they play. And that's their identity and they can
[3615.04 - 3619.84] P:1751.91 E:0.087478 |  rely on that next Tuesday knowing they're not going to be tired. Daniel, thank you very much.
[3620.40 - 3624.72] P:1810.93 E:0.093231 |  I just want to bring Joe Hart in. England are out and they're going to make a change, Joe.
[3624.72 - 3628.40] P:1749.13 E:0.094896 |  That was Daniel Batman, by the way, Austria goalkeeper. Kobe Mane, he's going to come on for
[3628.40 - 3634.88] P:1674.60 E:0.101607 |  Conor Gallagher here. Does that make sense to you? Yeah, I think it's something that the team
[3634.88 - 3640.48] P:1763.14 E:0.098769 |  will be looking forward to and that's a really forward thinking move. Joe, thank you. We will
[3641.12 - 3646.48] P:1773.31 E:0.100690 |  see you later. Surprised me. I didn't know that was happening. What, me talking to you or the sub?
[3646.48 - 3652.00] P:1682.16 E:0.103048 |  The sub? I was just going to tell you. You're in the cloud there, big man.
[3652.00 - 3658.16] P:1737.91 E:0.105127 |  Miles away, Miles off it, sorry. We'll send you back to your own little world, Joe. We'll see
[3658.16 - 3663.68] P:1719.60 E:0.103355 |  you later. Joe Hart with us. So that is the change. Kobe Mane on for Conor Gallagher.
[3663.68 - 3668.64] P:1765.26 E:0.089397 |  I'm sure we'll get the thoughts of Izzy and Conor very shortly after John. Yeah, in fact,
[3668.64 - 3672.32] P:1741.54 E:0.094753 |  let's do that because Slovenia just about to kick off. What about that? We weren't necessarily
[3672.32 - 3676.64] P:1659.93 E:0.089417 |  expecting that, were we? I mean, Conor Gallagher could have an issue, of course. Yeah, I think Conor
[3676.64 - 3681.84] P:1666.22 E:0.097212 |  Gallagher struggled to get in the game, but I mean, I like it. I like it. I think, you know, a lot of
[3681.84 - 3685.84] P:1492.59 E:0.094674 |  England fans have been calling for Kobe Mane to come in because of the way the season that he's
[3685.84 - 3691.28] P:1431.96 E:0.097254 |  at it, Manchester United and the dynamic kind of nature of his game and see how that affects
[3691.28 - 3696.88] P:1400.85 E:0.092769 |  Declan Rice as well. And maybe this is exactly what England need. Conor? Yeah, I think it's a
[3696.88 - 3699.84] P:1575.98 E:0.100064 |  sign of intent, John. I really do. I think it's a sign of intent from the manager that he's not
[3699.84 - 3704.56] P:1463.53 E:0.089444 |  happy with the first half. I think it's a sign of intent to put Kobe in and this needs a confident
[3704.56 - 3708.80] P:1656.73 E:0.097138 |  boy. We've watched him play for Manchester United all season. He doesn't seem very similar to Marguerite.
[3708.80 - 3712.72] P:1575.36 E:0.092955 |  Anything really affects him. So hopefully he can get in the ball here, make it tick and get the balls
[3712.80 - 3718.08] P:1616.36 E:0.099690 |  different for England. Yeah, it's loading a lot onto the shoulders of the 19 year old that he is
[3718.72 - 3724.56] P:1646.37 E:0.085660 |  coming on as a substitute, as he did in the first match against the Serbs, but England
[3724.56 - 3731.12] P:1653.15 E:0.092620 |  NIL, Slovenia NIL, referee Clemence Erpant is just about ready. He's waiting for the nod. Both matches
[3731.12 - 3738.00] P:1578.26 E:0.088177 |  are level at 0-0. Neither of them has lit up this German summer evening, certainly judging by what
[3738.56 - 3742.80] P:1548.59 E:0.099514 |  we're hearing from Maz, but it means that England would be going through as group winners Denmark
[3742.80 - 3750.40] P:1550.20 E:0.090129 |  in second and Slovenia as one of the third place sites and we're still waiting. There we are. There's
[3750.40 - 3758.32] P:1680.76 E:0.089390 |  the whistle. I guess they probably had to wait till the match began, began the other match between
[3759.44 - 3764.08] P:1571.46 E:0.092721 |  Denmark and Serbia. That's what they were waiting for. So finally we're underway. In fact, they
[3764.08 - 3767.36] P:1492.80 E:0.106163 |  haven't started yet, so they weren't waiting for that. I don't know what they were waiting for.
[3767.36 - 3772.80] P:1504.52 E:0.108313 |  Anyway, we're underway. England with Pickford in goal, Walker, Stones, Gay and Trippia,
[3773.44 - 3780.16] P:1426.14 E:0.105322 |  and now Cobbie Mayn who into the midfield alongside Rice, Saka, Ballingham, Forden and Kane. So
[3781.76 - 3787.76] P:1733.00 E:0.102640 |  Slovenia as they started the match are parked inside their own half. All black, the goalkeeper,
[3787.76 - 3792.64] P:1683.91 E:0.108622 |  made a couple of saves, but straightforward saves. Karnicini got right back, Drakusic,
[3793.28 - 3798.64] P:1592.22 E:0.105278 |  Biol and Janža the back, Stajanovic on the right, Čareen and Elšnika in the middle,
[3798.64 - 3805.20] P:1772.04 E:0.083677 |  Makar on the left and then Šporra and Šesko, who had one header. Pickfords really had next to
[3805.20 - 3813.36] P:1658.00 E:0.090248 |  nothing to do and very comfortably saved that header. And that match, the other match is underway
[3813.36 - 3818.56] P:1723.80 E:0.091565 |  now. Here comes Forden for England, Ford through to Rice. Now out to the left-hand side to Trippia,
[3818.64 - 3826.08] P:1515.73 E:0.095320 |  Tudelingham, there are England flags draped in every little corner of this Cologne stadium,
[3826.64 - 3829.52] P:1478.62 E:0.103027 |  all around the side of the pitch, but from the Slovenian section as well,
[3829.52 - 3834.80] P:1537.75 E:0.097119 |  where they're here in great numbers, around about 9,000 of them as Cobbie Mayn who gets his
[3834.80 - 3839.92] P:1693.49 E:0.091878 |  first touch now. That's a shewed, back to the halfway line to Mark Gay, Gay and Trippia makes
[3839.92 - 3845.84] P:1648.31 E:0.088172 |  himself available on the left-hand side, Forden, Trippia points forward, Forden, but Forden moves
[3845.84 - 3852.64] P:1470.65 E:0.107153 |  in field, Cobbie Mayn who number 26 on his back, Declan Rice comes short, then to the left-hand side,
[3853.36 - 3859.20] P:1477.89 E:0.117508 |  Dalyngham is there, Dalyngham turning up against Karnicini, slips the ball to Mayn who plays it
[3859.20 - 3866.40] P:1418.89 E:0.105454 |  back behind Trippia and Trippia just does that calm down motion with his palms of his hands.
[3866.40 - 3872.56] P:1461.12 E:0.099661 |  Dalyngham again on the left-hand side, Dalyngham, Dalyngham dummy to cross, then carries the ball
[3872.64 - 3877.68] P:1536.42 E:0.094530 |  into the central area, but turns and gives it back to Trippia, they want him to get it on his right
[3877.68 - 3882.40] P:1665.56 E:0.098206 |  foot, but just got it caught up underneath his feet and it's very very static again,
[3883.04 - 3888.64] P:1647.02 E:0.100568 |  Forden, now to Dalyngham, Trippia couldn't find the pass and now Slovenia will break away with a
[3888.64 - 3893.60] P:1732.98 E:0.097013 |  ball centrally, Walker tried to get there but the cover was there actually from Pekajosaka in the end,
[3893.60 - 3899.44] P:1662.87 E:0.090437 |  so England in the all-white kick with the blue stripe down the sides against Slovenia who are all
[3899.68 - 3906.40] P:1781.17 E:0.089666 |  in royal blue tonight, Saka, Saka goes between two Slovenian players, that's a heavy touch by
[3906.40 - 3911.12] P:1658.95 E:0.097220 |  Kane, bounces off Shevchuk, then back to Kane who actually plays it between his two central defenders
[3911.12 - 3915.12] P:1466.31 E:0.102243 |  in England, then going all the way back to Pickford. Yeah what Slovenia are doing is exactly the same
[3915.12 - 3919.12] P:1489.61 E:0.101100 |  as what they did in the first half, they've got two banks of four and they're two strikers,
[3919.12 - 3923.12] P:1574.89 E:0.098725 |  they're being relatively passive with their pressure and when the ball goes central into the
[3923.12 - 3927.92] P:1519.23 E:0.104196 |  likes of Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, that is when Slovenia get tight, they push and they try and
[3928.00 - 3933.68] P:1424.62 E:0.095908 |  force England into mistakes. The cream shirted Gareth Southgate is there standing on the edge of
[3933.68 - 3938.40] P:1623.20 E:0.099423 |  the coaching area having made his first change, he's not made the full five substitutions in either
[3938.40 - 3947.28] P:1416.77 E:0.088320 |  of the matches so far, England with Forden again on that far side, rolls it across to Saka, he's
[3947.28 - 3952.88] P:1539.77 E:0.100416 |  quite central actually, then Bellingham helps it on to Walker and Saka's continued his run, he gets
[3953.20 - 3957.76] P:1683.38 E:0.098443 |  a blatant shove in the back but keeps his feet Saka and is able to find the pass to Manu,
[3957.76 - 3962.80] P:1639.68 E:0.099246 |  Manu then into Bellingham, inside the penalty area defenders are there, Bellingham keeps possession
[3962.80 - 3966.72] P:1795.05 E:0.106624 |  and actually sees that it takes a touch off the defender and it's behind for Kona. Yeah it's
[3966.72 - 3971.20] P:1623.73 E:0.115166 |  brilliant from Bakayo Saka again, Kona we're saying at halftime, we've got a pump the ball out to him,
[3971.20 - 3974.32] P:1669.62 E:0.119475 |  his full back is up against his on the yellow card and that is what England are doing,
[3974.88 - 3979.52] P:1751.71 E:0.117531 |  and it's Koby Manu finding himself in an advanced position, he just plays a cheeky little pass
[3979.60 - 3985.84] P:1896.72 E:0.103866 |  inside to Jude Bellingham in England, get the corner. It's taken quickly and short by Trippia
[3986.72 - 3992.80] P:1865.14 E:0.101391 |  to Forden, then Manu, Forden wanted it back from Manu but he went in field on Manchester United
[3992.80 - 3996.88] P:1770.76 E:0.104435 |  Youngster, then Rice with the ball into the area, Kane heads it square, thought he might have gone
[3996.88 - 4004.24] P:1720.46 E:0.083338 |  for goal there, Kane in amongst the crowd of players, Slovenia clear it, Walker couldn't find the pass,
[4004.24 - 4009.20] P:1727.05 E:0.103732 |  was looking for Saka, probably the right intention, however bounces to Manu, Manu couldn't get past
[4009.20 - 4015.52] P:1798.56 E:0.105404 |  his man, Forden, all lovely footwork from Forden, little ball to his left to Jude Bellingham, now
[4015.52 - 4021.68] P:1777.25 E:0.097825 |  Trippia is there, Rice, then Manu, first time touch from him, Bellingham central almost found
[4021.68 - 4026.80] P:1660.91 E:0.095414 |  a way to, Kane, Sheshko chess sit down, this is good pressure from England at the start of the
[4026.80 - 4033.12] P:1705.78 E:0.107661 |  second half, Gay beats Spora quite comfortably, excellent work, once again from Mark Gay one of
[4033.12 - 4038.24] P:1708.58 E:0.107687 |  England's best players at this tournament, then Saka, Kane on the right in the area with the cross
[4038.24 - 4045.36] P:1743.76 E:0.112600 |  that is slid behind, for a corner to England from the right, Mark Gay you tell you what, we spoke
[4045.36 - 4050.32] P:1591.17 E:0.113831 |  about in pre-match about how confident and assured he looked, but my word that was classy from him,
[4050.32 - 4056.96] P:1684.27 E:0.098401 |  just setting England back up on the attack in another corner for them, Five Live, BBC sounds,
[4056.96 - 4061.76] P:1784.10 E:0.097334 |  that's where you find us, this European Championship all over Germany, bringing you the
[4061.76 - 4067.20] P:1795.31 E:0.095376 |  commentaries which are at the heart of what we do, every match is live and tonight here in
[4067.28 - 4074.32] P:1877.49 E:0.097114 |  sweltering Cologne, there's Mark Chapman and this has gone with Trippia to take the corner
[4074.32 - 4079.28] P:1652.51 E:0.097892 |  deep towards Kane who heads it across the box and then that's cleared up in the air, still in the box,
[4079.28 - 4085.20] P:1727.06 E:0.096265 |  headed away by Drakusic then fired back in from Foden, but through a crowd of players
[4085.20 - 4090.32] P:1687.07 E:0.100285 |  it was bouncing wide anyway and a goal kick, that's a pressure Konakodi, yeah good pressure,
[4090.32 - 4093.84] P:1661.05 E:0.094087 |  who has started the second half really well on the front foot trying to play in the opposition half
[4093.84 - 4098.24] P:1578.96 E:0.098501 |  which are really live and just being patient, be a little bit patient, can we force it out wide
[4098.24 - 4102.24] P:1493.98 E:0.095134 |  a little bit to Vakaio just to get in 1v1, but it's a better start the second half
[4102.24 - 4111.76] P:1505.34 E:0.097774 |  England nil, Slovenia nil, so Kobe menu on at half time, I notice there are 10 players in the
[4111.76 - 4117.36] P:1498.96 E:0.103288 |  England squad who've not got under the field yet, whereas the Spanish having made all of those
[4117.36 - 4124.72] P:1590.76 E:0.091876 |  changes yesterday, they've used everyone but the third choice goalkeeper, he has rice, that's the
[4124.72 - 4131.44] P:1553.80 E:0.096404 |  luxury isn't it of getting you two wins early, nil nil here, nil nil in the Denmark Serbia match
[4132.00 - 4138.72] P:1632.16 E:0.091090 |  as Kyle Walker carries it forward, so the table in this group it changed time and again in the
[4138.72 - 4142.96] P:1576.07 E:0.094308 |  earlier matches when I was listening earlier to Lee Blakeman and Stephen Warnock with a commentary
[4143.52 - 4148.24] P:1639.71 E:0.090464 |  on the exciting Netherlands Austria game, that group changed all the time, this is static
[4148.96 - 4155.92] P:1576.03 E:0.092841 |  which reflects the level of full mouth entertainment in these two matches, England
[4156.64 - 4162.40] P:1479.67 E:0.093899 |  six minutes into the second half, here's Foden, Foden and back to Stones, Mark Gaye
[4164.16 - 4168.80] P:1471.86 E:0.106393 |  who will be doing his reputation, no harm this young Crystal Palace defender putting his foot on
[4168.80 - 4175.20] P:1448.30 E:0.099944 |  the ball and then chipping it to Walker who is dragging it onto his right foot and playing a
[4175.20 - 4180.64] P:1477.76 E:0.101117 |  little pass forward to Kobe menu, Saka is here as well, back to Walker again in field to Foden in
[4180.64 - 4185.60] P:1610.14 E:0.108220 |  the central area, Foden all very nearly found the ball through to Saka, that's what England are looking
[4185.60 - 4191.04] P:1596.04 E:0.087283 |  for, that killer pass it just hasn't come yet around the edge of the Slovenian penalty area,
[4191.04 - 4196.00] P:1863.11 E:0.112347 |  Rice goes in for the challenge, I think Slovenia wanted a free kick for that, jumped all over
[4196.00 - 4200.72] P:1836.83 E:0.102885 |  Eltschnie, it wasn't given, Rice gets up, he's feeling his back there, I know it's Rice but he's
[4202.40 - 4206.08] P:1786.83 E:0.096366 |  he is back in the action and England with it on the left hand side with Dellingham,
[4206.08 - 4211.28] P:1780.35 E:0.101669 |  now Harry Kane, Kane goes for a high crossfield pass, Walker's in the box, first time volley across
[4211.28 - 4215.92] P:1703.02 E:0.104647 |  but he got that all wrong and all he was trying to do and you might have just heard that the tap of
[4215.92 - 4222.32] P:1784.99 E:0.093644 |  the post by Phil Foden, more frustration for England, yeah it's a wonderful crossfield ball and Cal Walker
[4222.32 - 4225.84] P:1649.64 E:0.087225 |  is the spare man at the back post for England, he can see what he's trying to do, he's trying to
[4226.00 - 4230.72] P:1688.88 E:0.089893 |  we've seen him do it from Manchester City, he's put it back into that six yard area first time
[4230.72 - 4234.72] P:1719.55 E:0.089410 |  to cause issues but he just doesn't execute execute the ball but what I would say John is
[4234.72 - 4241.28] P:1468.30 E:0.098671 |  that breeze inside the stadium is absolutely delightful, that's your classic cooling summer
[4241.28 - 4249.60] P:1601.23 E:0.100922 |  breeze blowing across western Germany, here's Rice inside his own half finding Walker
[4250.16 - 4255.52] P:1556.83 E:0.110653 |  and now it's the Slovenian supporters all jumping up and down, as Kane plays it into
[4255.52 - 4260.08] P:1679.93 E:0.100638 |  Dellingham inside the box, Defender was with him, he took a lovely touch which took it back
[4260.08 - 4265.68] P:1722.35 E:0.103714 |  towards the edge of the box and the and the recovering Beal came in with a challenge
[4266.96 - 4272.88] P:1672.44 E:0.092175 |  which deflected off Dellingham and Dellingham runs to the referee, he's got to be careful
[4272.88 - 4277.76] P:1633.09 E:0.088551 |  because it's the captain who's the only one who can do that but he asked the question and referee
[4277.76 - 4282.48] P:1612.18 E:0.087187 |  turned up and just turned away and said Gulki, yeah it's a proper good 50-50 that between
[4282.48 - 4288.40] P:1638.64 E:0.093301 |  Bellingham and Beal the centre back, yeah but Bellingham does respond, nice turn by
[4288.96 - 4292.72] P:1681.86 E:0.091797 |  Cherine for Slovenia and then plays it just behind
[4294.48 - 4298.64] P:1684.77 E:0.100553 |  Stajanovic on the right hand side and comes the challenge, Slovenia being forced back,
[4298.64 - 4304.80] P:1622.96 E:0.098686 |  this is the press that's been much discussed, there's Kane Leetit and Slovenia go all the way back
[4304.80 - 4312.16] P:1467.68 E:0.087486 |  to Gulki but Oblak, Slovenia just the second time that they've been at the European Championship
[4312.16 - 4319.60] P:1461.23 E:0.101992 |  as Slovenia and they have never reached the knockout stage at either a European Championship
[4319.60 - 4325.28] P:1530.56 E:0.100549 |  or a World Cup, Gay with a nice soft touch there to Trippier on the far side, Sheldon
[4326.24 - 4332.32] P:1447.88 E:0.110650 |  into Manu, the only match that they've won at the Major Tournament was in that group in South
[4332.32 - 4339.60] P:1533.42 E:0.114796 |  Africa when they beat Algeria and then in the third match not the greatest match that was either
[4339.60 - 4345.28] P:1458.84 E:0.109433 |  if you remember Jermaine Defoe scored the winner in England, eventually progressed second place in
[4345.28 - 4352.32] P:1408.01 E:0.108124 |  that group back in 2010, Stones plays it across to Gay now out to the left hand side to Trippier
[4352.96 - 4360.64] P:1413.11 E:0.104411 |  Bellingham then just very casually plays it back to Gay, excellent noise from the
[4360.64 - 4364.80] P:1383.24 E:0.108092 |  Slovenians at the moment, they're winning that little contest between the two sets of fans,
[4364.80 - 4370.40] P:1508.13 E:0.100051 |  they're outnumbered almost two to one, Saka, mind you Slovenia is the smallest country here,
[4370.40 - 4376.72] P:1477.06 E:0.103346 |  just two million people fall out from Trippier to Bellingham, Bellingham lifts the ball to the
[4376.72 - 4384.24] P:1641.24 E:0.098893 |  edge of the box that is headed away from by Biol, one backed by Rice, Rice finds the pass to the
[4384.24 - 4389.60] P:1588.63 E:0.096149 |  England number 10, Jude Bellingham, he's able to turn back and play it to Declan Rice then through
[4389.92 - 4396.16] P:1780.87 E:0.113260 |  to Manu, it's a very firmly challenged that's a free kick, the big number 21 Drakusic just
[4396.16 - 4401.28] P:1898.91 E:0.109838 |  tanked into the back of Kobe Manu and conceded the free kick, he's come right to the back of
[4401.28 - 4407.20] P:1881.76 E:0.107799 |  Kobe Manu there hasn't he, really aggressive front foot defending but England's best moments are
[4407.20 - 4412.32] P:1823.64 E:0.093277 |  coming from second phases, loose balls and that's okay as long as they do something with it and
[4412.32 - 4418.80] P:1642.44 E:0.087042 |  they've got set peace in another good area, we've got just over half an hour to play
[4419.76 - 4427.12] P:1592.75 E:0.099010 |  and still it is deadlock between England and Slovenia, Trippier and Foden, this free kick
[4427.12 - 4433.20] P:1662.31 E:0.094817 |  is over towards the left hand side all of 30 yards from goal with the angle, Trippier
[4434.16 - 4440.00] P:1817.47 E:0.105565 |  on his right foot, Foden on his left, it is the delivery from Foden, Kano know it and just had
[4440.00 - 4445.04] P:1726.80 E:0.096575 |  it away, Biol got to it, played back in by Saka, flicked to the back post, Rice is chasing but
[4445.12 - 4449.60] P:1751.54 E:0.106038 |  it took a touch off a defender's head corner from the left, yeah it's a brilliant defensive
[4449.60 - 4455.12] P:1716.04 E:0.114131 |  clearance from Biol, a centre back for Slovenia, he just gets a nick on it to push it away because
[4455.12 - 4462.08] P:1813.77 E:0.114840 |  Harry Kane is lurking behind him, he was lurking with intent, Foden is going to take this corner,
[4463.68 - 4467.68] P:1920.87 E:0.117075 |  three England players ran the penalty spot, two more closer to the edge of the box,
[4469.76 - 4474.08] P:1886.61 E:0.110589 |  here's the delivery from the corner, from Foden, outswinger Kains after it, it's headed down block
[4474.08 - 4480.56] P:1807.84 E:0.104315 |  by Seshko, not at a cross by Gay, Seshko heads in again, Gay then deflected goal with and the referee
[4480.56 - 4488.32] P:1715.16 E:0.101465 |  has blown the whistle, I think the challenge from Dukajos Saka on the edge of the six yard box,
[4488.32 - 4493.68] P:1721.98 E:0.091357 |  I think he's he's fouled a Slovenian defender and the free kick has been given and
[4496.56 - 4502.16] P:1642.09 E:0.106980 |  it was blocked on the line by Seshko, the initial effort, it was a real scramble and then Saka was
[4502.16 - 4508.88] P:1672.75 E:0.085290 |  going for an overhead kick wasn't he and that's conceded the free kick and he did catch, I think
[4508.88 - 4516.40] P:1638.29 E:0.092276 |  it was Biol wasn't it in the face and no no Sparra it was, Sparra who's just got to his feet,
[4516.40 - 4520.72] P:1654.64 E:0.100686 |  so he's receiving some treatment so let's see what's happening in the Denmark Serbia match,
[4520.72 - 4525.28] P:1573.22 E:0.104404 |  anything like a goal, Lehm has for Ruki. Well Serbia have had the ball in the net John Tadic
[4525.28 - 4529.68] P:1677.55 E:0.112027 |  and Jovic you're on in this second half now combining but not one but two Serbia players
[4529.68 - 4533.92] P:1805.30 E:0.105860 |  were offside so no goal but those two on the pitch now are a reflection of what Serbia know
[4533.92 - 4537.84] P:1660.67 E:0.097223 |  they have to do in this second half try and win to progress the knockout stages it is still
[4537.84 - 4542.64] P:1471.27 E:0.102925 |  though Denmark no Serbia now. So that means England going through as group winners Denmark in second
[4542.64 - 4547.84] P:1527.45 E:0.094909 |  Slovenia in third and England would be playing one of the third place sides very possibly the
[4547.84 - 4553.28] P:1539.03 E:0.095385 |  Netherlands in the round of 16, what about an overview from you Izzy Christensen on on what
[4553.28 - 4557.52] P:1571.81 E:0.100395 |  we've seen so far with almost an hour played. Well we expected a response in the second half I
[4557.52 - 4561.60] P:1449.82 E:0.102626 |  would say I think there's been a slight improvement from the first half performance I think Koby Manu
[4561.60 - 4567.76] P:1580.66 E:0.106023 |  is coming and he's getting in there he's pressing the ball up now and here he is doing exactly that
[4568.48 - 4573.20] P:1691.98 E:0.101686 |  Manu through the cane but running from deep running from almost the halfway line here is Saka
[4574.00 - 4579.44] P:1782.50 E:0.103508 |  Saka then back to Walker Sparra is back on the field by the way I think he just got a little bit
[4579.44 - 4584.08] P:1682.46 E:0.099482 |  of a kick in the face now Saka trying to find it in the area headed away to Cain and comes the
[4584.08 - 4588.48] P:1624.42 E:0.098068 |  challenge on him I think this will roll the way to Kieran Trepia it does in fact Bellingham takes
[4588.48 - 4593.60] P:1808.91 E:0.097156 |  it on gives it to Foden on the left hand side England turning Slovenia back in there they're
[4593.60 - 4599.36] P:1893.89 E:0.102665 |  absolutely dominating the possession Slovenia are not an easy team to find a way through we can see
[4599.36 - 4605.68] P:1875.41 E:0.099210 |  that we know that they're in form one defeat in the last 14 matches Rice though runs on down into
[4605.68 - 4611.84] P:1864.97 E:0.095071 |  the full back position gives it back Bellingham little touch from him to Foden now Koby Manu
[4611.84 - 4620.48] P:1883.56 E:0.105255 |  back to his fellow greater Mancunian Phil Foden Foden with Rice out there as well Rice goes for
[4620.48 - 4626.96] P:1847.52 E:0.096776 |  the long pass across the pitch Walker chests it down to Pukajosaka then back to Walker again
[4626.96 - 4631.44] P:1825.74 E:0.102919 |  England now looking to try and probe on the right there's space here for Foden in the central area
[4631.44 - 4636.16] P:1697.02 E:0.107772 |  but Foden was challenged by Sparra who just got a touch on that England come again though gay with
[4636.16 - 4640.72] P:1747.10 E:0.101028 |  a positive pass now Manu with the cross it's over Cain it'll bounce all the way to Bellingham
[4640.80 - 4645.44] P:1758.00 E:0.100824 |  who allows it to run away into the full back position Bellingham curls the lower one back to
[4645.44 - 4650.80] P:1826.29 E:0.101264 |  Rice Rice onto his right foot Foden on the edge of the area back to Rice again but no again breaks
[4650.80 - 4655.92] P:1745.13 E:0.108085 |  down on the edge of the box and Slovenia look to pray the England support is encouraged by their
[4655.92 - 4660.80] P:1793.83 E:0.108128 |  stout yeah they are but Slovenia is disciplined and how well their coach is really showing in this
[4660.80 - 4666.24] P:1796.64 E:0.101836 |  very moment they're not diving in they're being clean staying structured good possession for
[4666.24 - 4670.80] P:1774.92 E:0.101282 |  England here yeah Manu has definitely brought something to this England performance Walker
[4670.80 - 4676.24] P:1716.77 E:0.099680 |  takes on his defender Walker then to the byline pulls it across but the ball was out before
[4676.24 - 4681.60] P:1690.64 E:0.101717 |  Walker got there even though it was cleared away in the centre and is he okay Kyle Walker did he
[4681.60 - 4685.68] P:1584.89 E:0.102059 |  slide into the Hordens yeah just watching a replay he did a classic kick and run and he's got the
[4685.68 - 4690.72] P:1546.88 E:0.096027 |  pace and I couldn't believe he even managed to get to that ball he's so quick Kyle Walker but
[4690.72 - 4695.20] P:1399.16 E:0.098693 |  yeah his momentum's taking him in almost into the Slovenian fans behind that goal let's bring in
[4695.28 - 4699.76] P:1404.19 E:0.109025 |  Conor Cody again of Leicester City in England in Garra Southgate squad at the last two tournaments
[4699.76 - 4703.20] P:1437.24 E:0.110824 |  what are you thinking Conor yeah it's better John it's better on the front foot we're playing forward
[4703.20 - 4707.68] P:1467.75 E:0.109884 |  we're passing forward I still think we can use the flanks a little bit more with with Saka no
[4707.68 - 4711.76] P:1428.21 E:0.104566 |  Foden's coming on that left-hand side where he likes to play but I still think we can use the flanks
[4711.76 - 4716.32] P:1358.14 E:0.105826 |  outside with Kyle Walker and by Kyle Saka but a lot a lot better on the front foot like I said
[4716.32 - 4720.32] P:1586.88 E:0.106034 |  Mark Gay and John Stone to stay in the tacks and hopefully we keep on going now and take advantage
[4720.32 - 4724.80] P:1432.10 E:0.099596 |  of this yeah Jordan Pigford has barely touched the ball in the second half but he's got it now
[4725.28 - 4732.80] P:1289.52 E:0.100331 |  as he passes it out to John Stones England Nail Slovenia Nail five live from the BBC BBC
[4732.80 - 4738.40] P:1361.93 E:0.106339 |  sounds as well that's where you get the football daily at the Euros all of our podcast offerings
[4738.40 - 4745.84] P:1411.99 E:0.107584 |  many new ones for the Euros as well like you'll never beat Kyle Walker and Wayne Rooney's my Euro 2004
[4747.04 - 4752.96] P:1498.38 E:0.102274 |  all on BBC sounds here's Saka for England mainly back to Saka on the right he's got a little bit
[4752.96 - 4759.20] P:1679.19 E:0.109157 |  of space here but there's referees brought it back there was that flailing arm whatever it was
[4759.92 - 4765.92] P:1644.92 E:0.104617 |  it's given us a free kick for Slovenia yeah there's a one-two between Bakao Saka and Koby Mano
[4765.92 - 4771.12] P:1519.11 E:0.107349 |  when already you can just see the impact that Koby Mano is having very simple effective football
[4771.12 - 4775.04] P:1580.09 E:0.111059 |  doing a one-two with Saka down the wing and I think the referees pulled Saka back
[4775.92 - 4780.32] P:1595.12 E:0.117590 |  for the trailing arm like you say John on his full back just a bit of wrestling between the two
[4780.32 - 4789.28] P:1565.69 E:0.116404 |  there wasn't much in it and Jan Zsak will be suspended for the next match if Slovenia do get through
[4791.12 - 4796.56] P:1485.52 E:0.115371 |  again the Slovenian supporters trying to do that they're England are attacking towards that end and
[4796.56 - 4803.84] P:1476.10 E:0.116317 |  most of them in the white shirts on this beautiful evening are bouncing up and down in unison as
[4803.84 - 4810.08] P:1529.85 E:0.104218 |  Gay might have been fouled no he wasn't but Stones was there as the covering defender to put the ball
[4810.08 - 4817.12] P:1462.91 E:0.103885 |  out of play and amongst those ranks of England fans and flags on the far side throwing
[4817.68 - 4824.32] P:1416.96 E:0.105004 |  that Slovenia rare foray into the England half and Cherine now into the edge of the
[4824.32 - 4829.68] P:1644.53 E:0.108847 |  Eredish baller Cherine on his left foot got to be careful but it slices it well wide actually
[4829.68 - 4834.24] P:1656.94 E:0.114510 |  it went out of play midway between the goal and the corner play he's shown sparks this tournament
[4834.24 - 4839.04] P:1546.37 E:0.116907 |  Cherine essentially midfielder for Slovenia breaking out of that midfield and into the forward
[4839.04 - 4844.24] P:1596.43 E:0.120450 |  line he's creative he's got confidence to try to shot his left foot but definitely didn't connect
[4844.24 - 4853.28] P:1604.59 E:0.119118 |  with it one at all it remains goalless on this warm evening tough for Slovenia without the ball
[4853.28 - 4860.00] P:1574.41 E:0.114545 |  in these conditions England have made them work Stones taking the ball away from the edge of the
[4860.08 - 4866.08] P:1596.42 E:0.112840 |  England penalty area the England fans now responding with one of their famous chance
[4866.08 - 4875.68] P:1617.21 E:0.110349 |  as you can hear Gay in possession now forward towards John Stones Stones has got Walker available
[4875.68 - 4881.76] P:1739.40 E:0.112180 |  here's Cobby Nainu the young Manchester United man back to the Manchester City defender
[4882.56 - 4885.36] P:1786.60 E:0.116972 |  John Stones squared mark gay
[4888.08 - 4894.08] P:1780.67 E:0.108520 |  gay goes for the long pass towards Walker gets up heads it in field Cobby Nainu slips over but
[4894.08 - 4901.28] P:1599.21 E:0.104894 |  Walker's able but back at Bacchio-Sacar's able to keep possession for England now gay gay through
[4901.28 - 4908.48] P:1674.06 E:0.106827 |  the middle towards Bellingham Bellingham tall statuette to Kyle Walker now to the right hand
[4908.48 - 4914.40] P:1715.58 E:0.106846 |  side to Bacchio-Sacar two men on it Walker's available uses Kyle Walker near the right corner
[4914.40 - 4918.64] P:1686.96 E:0.106119 |  of the box Cobby Nainu's out there as well Bellingham makes a run into the box but still
[4918.64 - 4924.56] P:1594.20 E:0.108987 |  Cobby Nainu with a ball at his feet Kyle Walker behind it Walker Declan Rice is able to get there
[4924.56 - 4929.52] P:1491.97 E:0.110847 |  ahead of Sheshko but then the pass from Rice is one side of Sacar and it will roll all the way through
[4929.52 - 4935.76] P:1749.07 E:0.114197 |  for a goal okay gay it's just lacking that spot that's just lacking that final ball that piece of
[4935.84 - 4941.12] P:1806.78 E:0.118136 |  quality yeah it's just a loose pass from Declan Rice although it's the vignan play who while I was
[4941.12 - 4948.96] P:1768.80 E:0.108950 |  looking at you it's Janja the right the the left back who's now gone down off the field in fact he
[4948.96 - 4958.56] P:1622.75 E:0.112257 |  was shepherding the ball out and Bellingham was chasing it and he's basically making out that
[4958.56 - 4962.80] P:1566.64 E:0.123574 |  he's got a knee in the back yeah he's trying to be clever Janja and trying to keep the referee
[4962.80 - 4967.44] P:1564.70 E:0.119126 |  because it's Jude Bellingham coming at him at pace he's done well to shepherd the ball out
[4967.44 - 4971.92] P:1538.10 E:0.116309 |  Janja and he just feels the impact of Jude Bellingham and tries to come the referee but
[4972.40 - 4979.20] P:1543.90 E:0.115895 |  referees having none of it still nail nail in both matches tonight not sure that this group
[4979.20 - 4984.88] P:1551.44 E:0.108396 |  is going to live long in the memory years to come remember Euro 2024 what happened in that
[4984.88 - 4991.84] P:1572.48 E:0.110702 |  group again we'll have to get the record books out but for England this scoreline means they would
[4991.84 - 4997.68] P:1560.82 E:0.107297 |  be going through as group winners however if Denmark scored that would change things and
[4998.80 - 5003.04] P:1469.69 E:0.114936 |  were Denmark to go one nil up England would drop down to second in the group
[5003.76 - 5011.36] P:1483.04 E:0.115859 |  on the by virtue of the number of goals scored but it is England currently top of the table
[5012.56 - 5020.56] P:1522.83 E:0.117908 |  Slovenia playing the ball back to Björn Harry Paine forces him to hit it long headed forward
[5020.56 - 5027.84] P:1554.69 E:0.112256 |  towards Šesko Slovenia yet to make a change on this warm evening and we are well into the last
[5027.84 - 5036.16] P:1578.76 E:0.112559 |  half hour now match as Keck must be thinking about a change you would think Trippia to Tholdon then
[5036.16 - 5044.40] P:1740.60 E:0.116613 |  back to Trippia and Kieran Trippia just uses cold coldon then Trippia again there's no movement
[5044.48 - 5052.64] P:1708.72 E:0.110048 |  ahead of him so it goes square again the mark gay and then Kyle Walker Sacher on the right hand side
[5054.00 - 5060.24] P:1594.69 E:0.116792 |  Kyle Walker again Slovenia just happy to sit off the ball there will be a 606 by the way to talk
[5060.24 - 5065.60] P:1667.36 E:0.108749 |  about this England performance with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton and the lines I do believe are
[5065.60 - 5073.04] P:1575.46 E:0.110472 |  open on 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 once we've wrapped things up here in Cologne still England in
[5073.12 - 5078.88] P:1661.24 E:0.104106 |  possession by Lowell is telling you that Walker now Sacher Sacher is able to play a ball that's
[5078.88 - 5083.28] P:1508.93 E:0.115611 |  pace yet to came on the edge of the area but B always able to clear it away headed forward by
[5083.28 - 5088.88] P:1621.69 E:0.109026 |  Rice now Fordon to the right hand side Walker is there Harry Kane available on the edge of the box
[5088.88 - 5095.84] P:1627.25 E:0.106693 |  instead it's Maynard square towards Fordon now Sacher in the central area back to Mark gay gay
[5096.56 - 5101.60] P:1587.98 E:0.113162 |  looks up Sacher in front of him left to his right to Rice now Fordon through the middle
[5101.60 - 5106.00] P:1639.79 E:0.113317 |  Fordon wriggles away going into the tight space goes down in between two Slovenian players but
[5106.00 - 5111.20] P:1652.73 E:0.109996 |  referee to the bank is is not giving the free kick and gay now has got to be careful Spora he's
[5111.20 - 5117.84] P:1849.37 E:0.111724 |  pulled him back blatantly Spora goes down Stones was there as a covering defender so it is only
[5117.84 - 5125.36] P:1759.61 E:0.106502 |  a yellow card but that was very very dangerous from Mark gay he's a very lucky boy Mark gay he's
[5125.36 - 5132.56] P:1628.58 E:0.112227 |  been exceptional all tournament but that one there he's just let Spora pick up the loose ball
[5132.56 - 5137.12] P:1629.74 E:0.116619 |  and he's had to tug him down he's pulled his shirt the referee's seeing it because Sacher was away
[5137.12 - 5143.12] P:1574.18 E:0.112974 |  and he had his strike partnership sheska right up there with him that was that was Dyson the danger
[5143.12 - 5146.88] P:1612.48 E:0.112260 |  corner Cody yeah John yeah it was and it was a miscommunication in the middle of pitch from
[5146.88 - 5151.60] P:1562.64 E:0.112890 |  John Stones and Mark gay and I think Mark my gay thought John Stones was going to take charge
[5151.60 - 5156.48] P:1626.92 E:0.108485 |  and vice-versa is tough but you've got to stay switched on at all times these are a tough team
[5156.48 - 5160.00] P:1644.52 E:0.107939 |  to beat on the counter that's the only time they're going to hate us John on the counter
[5160.00 - 5163.84] P:1629.48 E:0.106524 |  attack that's the only thing they're going to do so we have to make sure that we stop the counter
[5163.84 - 5168.32] P:1509.06 E:0.115025 |  attack from Slovenia well well I have news that I think will be welcomed by the England support
[5168.32 - 5175.36] P:1566.55 E:0.106066 |  as Cole Tama is going to come on as a substitute for his first taste of action at this tournament
[5176.08 - 5180.24] P:1498.95 E:0.113138 |  Garry Southgate is speaking to him but it's a free kick to Slovenia first of all
[5183.20 - 5187.36] P:1509.00 E:0.112710 |  there's no court well there is a correlation between the decibel levels
[5187.36 - 5192.72] P:1450.58 E:0.112159 |  in here with the England fans and that man there down down there Cole Tama getting ready to come on
[5192.72 - 5196.00] P:1534.53 E:0.116222 |  because they've seen that they're responding to that they know that he could be the man
[5196.56 - 5202.48] P:1622.59 E:0.107451 |  that unlocks this match for England yeah they've been itching for him to be giving an opportunity
[5202.56 - 5206.48] P:1494.99 E:0.115584 |  we didn't see him in the first two matches there was a little bit of talk that maybe there was a
[5207.36 - 5215.44] P:1655.85 E:0.107109 |  an injury issue however free kick for Slovenia first of all and Cherine with his right foot
[5215.44 - 5222.40] P:1576.12 E:0.109497 |  this could test Pickford two-man wall the actual fact that he's played in left footed by Janja
[5222.40 - 5226.80] P:1692.45 E:0.115298 |  and Gallingham has gone down inside the box the referee's given the free kick the free kick was
[5226.80 - 5231.68] P:1618.93 E:0.112475 |  over hit anyway and that was a massive wasted opportunity for Slovenia yeah it was a big waste
[5231.68 - 5236.24] P:1458.99 E:0.119600 |  from Slovenia but obviously from an England perspective a really good line Jude Bellingham
[5236.24 - 5241.52] P:1532.74 E:0.113052 |  looks like you might have cocked one there yeah he just ah dear dear he takes some on the front
[5241.52 - 5245.20] P:1588.67 E:0.117360 |  yeah Shpora just catches Jude Bellingham but I think Jude Bellingham has actually gone down a
[5245.20 - 5249.28] P:1509.19 E:0.115336 |  little bit too easily there but nonetheless just relieved a bit of pressure for England
[5249.84 - 5256.16] P:1586.53 E:0.110028 |  well it is a straight swap I think Pukaj Osaka Kona is the man who makes way for Cole Tama coming on
[5256.16 - 5261.04] P:1573.35 E:0.107394 |  yeah I think everyone's excited by Cole Tama and listen I think he's put him on there to get it
[5261.04 - 5265.28] P:1597.50 E:0.112146 |  to get out Janja I think like we said in the first half he's on the booking give Cole Tama the ball
[5265.28 - 5271.12] P:1615.29 E:0.114116 |  and run by the way John the England fans have been incredible haven't he yeah it's uh the the noise
[5271.12 - 5277.84] P:1609.89 E:0.106800 |  levels in here they've had a great day as Jim Bourne used to say in the sunshine of Cologne
[5277.84 - 5282.32] P:1674.04 E:0.110831 |  they'll have enjoyed themselves I'm pleased to say that everything seems to be calm there's
[5283.36 - 5289.44] P:1585.92 E:0.107997 |  there's no talk of trouble which was a big fear but what a cheer that was when Cole Tama's name
[5289.52 - 5294.96] P:1600.01 E:0.107143 |  went up on the board and on he comes this 22 year old who's had a brilliant season
[5295.52 - 5300.24] P:1529.45 E:0.115650 |  the Premier League young player of the season and now he's playing at the Euros for England
[5302.24 - 5309.12] P:1598.39 E:0.103225 |  John Stokes his former teammate he has Declan Rice Tama number 24 in his back
[5310.08 - 5315.12] P:1524.85 E:0.115639 |  it's been a fairy tale style script that he's had this season from the moment he made that move from
[5315.12 - 5322.48] P:1573.28 E:0.102569 |  Manchester City and now he's hugging the touchline on the right hand side as England
[5322.48 - 5327.28] P:1553.73 E:0.114043 |  have possession I think that's the sort of positive move that the England supporters will have applauded
[5327.28 - 5333.76] P:1756.17 E:0.104316 |  from Gareth Southgate but particularly if it does actually come off it's nil nil and it's still nil nil
[5334.32 - 5338.96] P:1765.72 E:0.112540 |  in the Denmark Serbia match so England with these score lines are going through as group winners
[5339.68 - 5347.44] P:1734.54 E:0.105085 |  Declan Rice now to John Stokes he has Tama he has his first touch of the ball from Foden
[5348.00 - 5354.16] P:1627.71 E:0.106759 |  and then Kobimeno as well all of these Mancunians on the field together
[5355.28 - 5361.92] P:1752.57 E:0.113172 |  Kane goes for as Beall and is pulled over Blainley pulled back and Beall surely will be booked for that
[5361.92 - 5366.88] P:1774.80 E:0.105594 |  and also when you think Beall very fortunate not to be yellow carded already and that is a
[5366.96 - 5372.16] P:1604.72 E:0.107427 |  booking for him yeah and he is a very lucky boy Beall the Slovenian centre back he just loses that
[5372.16 - 5376.16] P:1610.58 E:0.109213 |  duel where Harry Kane Harry Kane drives away from him and he chugs him down a little bit similar
[5376.16 - 5381.84] P:1510.84 E:0.115513 |  to Mark Gay earlier at the other end of the pitch but already Cole Palmer's body shape by the way
[5381.84 - 5389.36] P:1583.61 E:0.113209 |  he looks lively dynamic and he just wants the ball at his feet England nil Slovenia nil 72 minutes on
[5389.36 - 5395.04] P:1586.44 E:0.114046 |  the clock and England with this free kick won by the captain won by Harry Kane
[5396.88 - 5402.88] P:1610.54 E:0.110546 |  and standing over the ball Trippie and Foden as the referee marks out the white line
[5403.52 - 5409.76] P:1569.01 E:0.112048 |  so three-man wall has been put up by Jan O'Black O'Black who's just had a couple of routine
[5409.76 - 5415.60] P:1664.82 E:0.102082 |  saves to make so far in this match all in black he's lining up his wall and then moves back into a
[5415.60 - 5422.64] P:1821.52 E:0.103835 |  central position Foden speaks into the ear of Kieran Trippie it's Trippie who's placing it which
[5422.64 - 5427.20] P:1884.70 E:0.106097 |  makes it look like he's going to deliver it to the back post Declan Rice is there just
[5427.20 - 5432.80] P:1865.83 E:0.104234 |  picturing with his shorts he's ready Bellingham's ready as well referee's whistle's gone
[5433.44 - 5438.48] P:1783.45 E:0.096594 |  Trippie with the free kick into the back post Gay heads it back but heads it out of the box but
[5438.48 - 5444.08] P:1719.76 E:0.106930 |  Palmer's the first man there for England and in comes Dracusic with the challenge
[5445.04 - 5451.20] P:1554.85 E:0.112905 |  Throin is taken back for the halfway line by Walker and then Walker Trippie has the
[5451.20 - 5456.80] P:1576.56 E:0.109712 |  furthest outfield player back for England and then Foden and Trippie are actually
[5457.60 - 5463.04] P:1599.90 E:0.100370 |  rolling all the way back for a rare touch again for Jordan Pickford if he keeps a clean sheet
[5463.04 - 5468.40] P:1390.93 E:0.106577 |  tonight Pickford he'll break Peter Shultons record of clean sheets for England at Major
[5468.40 - 5474.72] P:1459.00 E:0.108977 |  Tournament there is a Slovenian change coming presently trying to see who it is but England
[5474.72 - 5483.36] P:1394.20 E:0.103989 |  with the ball on the left hand side Mark Gay Rice drops into the centre circle makes himself
[5483.36 - 5489.44] P:1569.86 E:0.096724 |  available he has Kyle Walker now and Walker sees Phil Foden in a central area Foden
[5490.32 - 5496.00] P:1709.36 E:0.100760 |  then to the far side towards Trippie Colt Palmer stayed out there on the left hand side actually
[5496.00 - 5499.92] P:1657.47 E:0.110583 |  having been out there he takes on his men two of them there and then in comes the
[5499.92 - 5504.56] P:1730.98 E:0.111952 |  in comes the challenge from Sklyanovic to put it out of play Palmer immediately takes the throw
[5504.56 - 5510.88] P:1653.68 E:0.099082 |  back to Declan Rice Rice does well he beats his man now takes on Carnichne then Rice gets it back
[5510.88 - 5515.84] P:1703.70 E:0.107184 |  and shoots across the face of goal as gasps from the England fans at the other end I'm not sure it
[5515.84 - 5521.76] P:1797.06 E:0.095779 |  was terribly close but um but that was better again from England yeah it was a snapshot from
[5521.76 - 5527.20] P:1562.68 E:0.105374 |  Declan Rice he just took it quickly after that little bit of build-up play with himself from
[5527.20 - 5531.84] P:1572.66 E:0.107537 |  Foden finding himself more advanced Declan Rice but I tell you what that's the first time I've
[5531.84 - 5536.56] P:1723.70 E:0.106141 |  actually seen an England wide player in this instance Cole Palmer out on that left hand side
[5536.56 - 5541.12] P:1655.66 E:0.109258 |  actually take his full back on down the outside and all of a sudden it looked like the world
[5541.12 - 5548.40] P:1684.15 E:0.113488 |  had opened up and we had a bit of natural whip and a big cheer from the Slovenian fans Sheshko is off
[5548.48 - 5554.16] P:1573.35 E:0.107404 |  you know he has been carrying an injury so he's been substituted with 15 minutes ago
[5554.16 - 5562.32] P:1561.07 E:0.108377 |  and a massive cheer for Jossip Ilychic who is uh such a favorite was recalled for these euros after
[5562.32 - 5569.12] P:1621.04 E:0.100831 |  a couple of years out of the international picture he's the veteran at 36 years old so the number 26
[5569.12 - 5575.28] P:1452.32 E:0.109560 |  is on to win his 82nd cap for Slovenia and the England fans respond with the anthem England
[5575.28 - 5582.08] P:1464.44 E:0.109209 |  Nail Slovenia Nail it's a match that is he has not really matched the atmosphere in the stance
[5583.12 - 5586.96] P:1524.29 E:0.109844 |  no it hasn't and I also think the England fans are just applauding the fact that the sun's gone in
[5586.96 - 5593.12] P:1512.10 E:0.113804 |  and they can pull off for a bit still sweltering though they've been unbelievable I like Connor
[5593.12 - 5599.12] P:1546.34 E:0.103647 |  we're saying the noise is incredible yeah they just want a goal in this match two only two goals
[5599.12 - 5606.16] P:1593.33 E:0.094644 |  scored by England in the three matches but crucially only one conceded so far Nail Nail
[5607.04 - 5615.44] P:1726.82 E:0.100321 |  and uh beyond across to Drakusic his pass forward Trippier gets there first heads to the halfway
[5615.44 - 5623.68] P:1644.00 E:0.095401 |  line and then a back heel flick into his into his own half for Drakusic uses Oblak Harry Kane
[5624.24 - 5627.84] P:1542.57 E:0.110746 |  closest to him Oblak's ball to the halfway line Rice has been called over there
[5628.40 - 5632.72] P:1743.22 E:0.115390 |  referee plays the advantage and it's a good advantage as Corden's able to volley the ball
[5633.36 - 5639.60] P:1725.89 E:0.110228 |  lovely touch to Walker now cold Palmer back on the right hand side Palmer lovely ball through
[5639.60 - 5647.04] P:1741.63 E:0.103297 |  Manu across there's no one there played it behind Harry Kane's run but much much better and the
[5647.04 - 5653.68] P:1829.93 E:0.106275 |  excellent pass through from cold Palmer as oh it's a yellow card for Corden for a challenge center
[5653.68 - 5660.40] P:1771.78 E:0.099257 |  field so so Phil Corden picks up a booking that was a cheap one yeah that was cheap but yeah just
[5660.40 - 5665.12] P:1602.89 E:0.096142 |  watching it back it's Dacklin Rice that's doing the sweeping up he causes the foul and I think
[5665.12 - 5670.64] P:1370.60 E:0.099411 |  I see what Foden was booked for then was it a bit of descent perhaps yeah must have been yeah and it
[5670.64 - 5674.72] P:1482.95 E:0.102510 |  was and then you could tell from the way that he sort of flapped his hand there's you know I can't
[5674.80 - 5678.88] P:1532.31 E:0.101842 |  believe you've booked me for that what about the Palmer pass called Connor fantastic passing
[5678.88 - 5683.84] P:1630.16 E:0.101044 |  when England become good and you have a couple of chances it's not it's not difficult play it's
[5683.84 - 5687.04] P:1698.75 E:0.103728 |  quite simple what they're doing it's runs in behind it's lovely passing behind which these
[5687.04 - 5690.64] P:1516.61 E:0.101203 |  players are capable of because they're fantastic players and it's not that hard it's not that
[5690.64 - 5696.88] P:1636.32 E:0.093461 |  difficult so just keep being simple keep forcing the issue and playing them simple passes so it's
[5696.88 - 5707.12] P:1701.14 E:0.087078 |  still 0-0 in both matches stones to Walker now he has called Palmer again he's he's brought a bit
[5707.12 - 5711.92] P:1810.39 E:0.100208 |  of life to this England performance Palmer then chips it forward this is for Kane that was beautifully
[5711.92 - 5717.92] P:1767.25 E:0.111163 |  weighted as well Kane's ball across to the back post is slid behind by Karny Schnee with Foden
[5717.92 - 5723.52] P:1682.10 E:0.104736 |  waiting behind him corner Kane what a run and Foden's coming in at the back post on that far
[5723.60 - 5729.12] P:1712.90 E:0.108220 |  left hand side and Harry Kane looks up and he's only got one place and one person to aim for and
[5729.12 - 5733.76] P:1856.85 E:0.115133 |  he almost finds Foden it's almost exceptional from Harry Kane yeah it's almost as if Harry Kane's
[5733.76 - 5740.16] P:1781.39 E:0.110100 |  saying I like the look of this from Palmer and what he might be able to provide for me Foden with
[5740.16 - 5746.88] P:1768.44 E:0.104991 |  a corner from the left for England high want over the top of stones Kane got his head to it and
[5746.88 - 5753.84] P:1679.87 E:0.101710 |  as a judge to have been fouling his defender and it's a free kick to Slovenia inside their own box
[5754.64 - 5761.76] P:1600.99 E:0.103517 |  there are low fives from the Slovenians they are awkward opponents that unbeaten at the tournament
[5761.76 - 5769.28] P:1535.05 E:0.104038 |  it might be three draws out of three for them but they certainly won't have given up hope of
[5769.28 - 5774.56] P:1479.33 E:0.114075 |  potentially winning this match could be a tense last 10 minutes Connor yeah
[5774.56 - 5778.16] P:1602.55 E:0.110107 |  Cole Palmer's help though John he's helped a little bit of an injection of pace a little bit of
[5778.16 - 5782.72] P:1560.97 E:0.110290 |  authority coming inside playing forward passing forward running forward we know his qualities
[5782.72 - 5789.12] P:1629.14 E:0.097522 |  anyway but he's just give this game a little bit of life I think. Nell Nell as Foden deflects the
[5789.12 - 5794.24] P:1454.97 E:0.108620 |  ball out for throwing on the halfway line more life sport tomorrow so there are two commentary
[5794.24 - 5800.08] P:1474.78 E:0.098264 |  times tomorrow when groups E and F will be decided you'll hear the commentaries with us on five live
[5800.08 - 5804.40] P:1522.28 E:0.092816 |  five o'clock eight o'clock you know the drill by now as the ball is played back to Pickford
[5804.40 - 5809.52] P:1646.39 E:0.098913 |  we'll just pass it out to Walker he's going to just allow the ball to run and then take it away
[5810.24 - 5816.32] P:1565.82 E:0.097356 |  from Malacca and and also tomorrow more cricket commentary feels like a cricket season
[5817.36 - 5822.40] P:1527.50 E:0.115128 |  as the county championship matches will conclude and England New Zealand from one o'clock as well
[5822.40 - 5829.68] P:1537.52 E:0.100168 |  the women's ODI from 1245 on sports extra that's all the life sport tomorrow but now we are
[5829.68 - 5836.56] P:1819.70 E:0.106231 |  almost into the last 10 minutes here forgettable match a wonderful atmosphere
[5837.84 - 5846.16] P:1774.52 E:0.103828 |  Walker on the halfway line Walker to Palmer Palmer turning twisting kicking on Janja
[5846.16 - 5851.44] P:1644.97 E:0.106454 |  Janja did well actually Manu Bellingham Bellingham wants to get into this act with Palmer
[5851.44 - 5856.88] P:1671.60 E:0.108758 |  Manu as well all very close tight quarters and then it's played away but Walker's onto this
[5856.96 - 5861.04] P:1739.31 E:0.119239 |  there's a man down Janja's down again and the referee has stopped play
[5862.16 - 5871.28] P:1816.83 E:0.104044 |  and that was that was very kind of the referee to stop play for for Janja being down
[5871.28 - 5876.64] P:1528.22 E:0.098682 |  it's not a head in two there's no contact there he's gone down I think he's asking for a bit
[5876.64 - 5882.88] P:1630.40 E:0.106448 |  treatment but what he is doing now is he's using game management tactics he's recognized that England
[5883.68 - 5887.60] P:1687.78 E:0.105882 |  just starting to turn the screw it's just stuck in the momentum out of England's attacks this is
[5887.60 - 5891.60] P:1735.54 E:0.106021 |  the benefit here of the I don't know why he stopped playing the first place but the referee
[5891.60 - 5896.48] P:1691.27 E:0.093880 |  is saying to the Slovenian medical people come on then on the field treating and Janja has to get
[5896.48 - 5903.76] P:1650.52 E:0.089875 |  through his feet however it's disrupted the play as you said free kick starts with a drop ball
[5905.04 - 5910.32] P:1668.09 E:0.097632 |  England with these scorelines 10 minutes away from finishing as group winners in
[5911.12 - 5918.64] P:1668.66 E:0.103093 |  not the most wholly convincing style but a group win is a group win I suppose but it can change yet
[5919.52 - 5924.80] P:1653.63 E:0.108381 |  still nail nail in both matches Palmer goes one way the other then beats his man flick from Manu
[5924.80 - 5929.92] P:1664.05 E:0.106828 |  Bellingham on the edge of the box Bellingham works it back and actually Rice loses out in the challenge
[5929.92 - 5934.56] P:1532.04 E:0.102159 |  Slovenia will break as the ball is played out here and I don't think I don't think
[5935.36 - 5940.56] P:1601.45 E:0.101771 |  that was going to keep it in no he's not it's out of play and England are going to make another
[5940.56 - 5945.36] P:1678.91 E:0.095037 |  change and Trent Alexander Arnold as we suspected is he yeah is going to come on as a substitute
[5945.36 - 5950.80] P:1654.40 E:0.097418 |  yeah I had a funny feeling he'd enter the pitch at some point and predicted that he will have an
[5950.80 - 5955.36] P:1646.73 E:0.102128 |  impact as well but we'll see about that but again Cole Palmer getting on the outside of the full
[5955.36 - 5960.16] P:1703.67 E:0.100706 |  back getting the fans off their seats it's what we want to see still no no Palmer though again
[5960.16 - 5964.64] P:1597.63 E:0.097117 |  dangerous ball headed away on the edge of the box I feel like I've said that every time Palmer
[5964.64 - 5969.60] P:1674.31 E:0.098682 |  has been on it you know he's he's already he's already brought a great deal to this this England
[5969.60 - 5974.08] P:1573.81 E:0.100225 |  performance and England fans will be saying where was he here's Bellingham through the middle Bellingham
[5974.08 - 5980.48] P:1588.35 E:0.093722 |  out with the left hand side to Trippia England sending white shirts forward Trippia back to Declan
[5980.48 - 5989.20] P:1536.46 E:0.094664 |  Rice Rice across to John Stones Trent Alexander Arnold standing with Gareth Southgate gets a
[5989.20 - 5995.12] P:1564.30 E:0.098664 |  little pat on the back we will bring you the interviews during 606 as well Robbie Savage
[5995.12 - 6000.64] P:1549.75 E:0.096318 |  and Chris Sutton standing by to take your calls on what you thought of the England performance
[6000.64 - 6008.48] P:1598.23 E:0.098124 |  tonight 08085 909 693 Robbie in the studio the five-life studio Chris here in Germany
[6009.04 - 6016.40] P:1598.55 E:0.095864 |  up in Essen he has Rice Rice's ball air really for Kane to chase bounces into the penalty area
[6016.48 - 6021.20] P:1716.05 E:0.094594 |  Bellingham's there as well Kane has to take it out and then plays it back to Fordham left foot
[6021.20 - 6026.56] P:1728.13 E:0.101256 |  shot from him that's blocked by Elshneak on the edge of the box gain England take up possession
[6026.56 - 6032.48] P:1844.86 E:0.100797 |  Fordham 30 yards from the goal squared towards Walker now here's the danger man Palmer again
[6032.48 - 6038.48] P:1865.02 E:0.103417 |  Palmer taking on Janja onto his left foot ball into the area awkward for Beal just shanks it up in
[6038.48 - 6043.84] P:1725.57 E:0.098033 |  the air headed away by Janja then Slovenia back to the edge of the box where Drakusic just fires
[6043.84 - 6049.92] P:1675.55 E:0.091265 |  it away downfield okay he's got to be careful which he is heads it down heads it down but he's
[6049.92 - 6058.48] P:1721.55 E:0.083813 |  got to play back to Pickford and there was there was a big figure of Ilichich after it and then
[6058.48 - 6065.04] P:1697.44 E:0.110901 |  there's a foul on the halfway line because Janja has won another freaking yeah he's up to all the
[6065.04 - 6070.08] P:1843.49 E:0.098331 |  tricks in the book Janja but I'll tell you what he's had a fantastic game at left back for Slovenia
[6070.16 - 6075.44] P:1651.48 E:0.084026 |  he just comes through the back of Cope Palmer oh come on I don't think there's anything wrong
[6075.44 - 6079.68] P:1571.59 E:0.100058 |  with that I think he's given it for head contact but there was anything in it frustrating Connor
[6079.68 - 6082.56] P:1613.28 E:0.112763 |  yeah but you know what John they're doing it well they're doing it well we've all been
[6082.56 - 6087.36] P:1678.53 E:0.107425 |  there is and we were we're we're drawing we need a point we need a win we've got a good result
[6087.36 - 6091.12] P:1695.81 E:0.106438 |  and and we do things to try and win the game and they're doing it well and England have got to stand
[6091.12 - 6093.76] P:1721.87 E:0.100683 |  up to this they've got to get around this they've got to try and keep the ball on the deck and play
[6093.76 - 6101.36] P:1572.98 E:0.095154 |  properly if as expected they do get a place in the round of 16 then they will be difficult opponents
[6101.36 - 6107.92] P:1657.99 E:0.099380 |  whoever they're playing uh Alexander Arnold is on for trivia so a rare a rare sight of Kyle Walker
[6107.92 - 6114.72] P:1575.09 E:0.096703 |  at left back yeah I like this to be honest with you because Trent Alexander Arnold's right foot is
[6114.72 - 6118.48] P:1570.73 E:0.106320 |  up there with one of the best in the world and here's the pass from him long and downfield
[6119.12 - 6124.64] P:1591.62 E:0.094779 |  that cut out by the shaven head of Dracusic on the edge of the box still 0-0
[6125.44 - 6129.20] P:1576.64 E:0.106016 |  and now only a matter of five and a half minutes left to play we'll bring in the
[6129.20 - 6137.60] P:1660.34 E:0.095809 |  interviews during six oh six with garrison's gate and the England players as uh Slovenia now make a
[6137.60 - 6144.96] P:1539.70 E:0.102484 |  double change so Jan Malakka is coming off from the left hand side of the midfield and
[6144.96 - 6152.96] P:1653.83 E:0.095905 |  Jan Gorinc Stankovic of Sturmbratz is coming off to replace him so Stankovic the number five
[6153.76 - 6158.24] P:1709.26 E:0.100348 |  is on and uh also coming off is Sporar
[6163.12 - 6172.00] P:1692.30 E:0.103418 |  so a double change for Slovenia with Jan Sejla coming on who is a forward player Sejla so that
[6172.00 - 6181.68] P:1656.14 E:0.087624 |  is a straight swap the number 19 who plays in Switzerland with uh Lugano so Jan Sejla
[6184.24 - 6191.36] P:1595.32 E:0.096669 |  under the field England nil Slovenia nil and uh England
[6193.04 - 6199.04] P:1695.48 E:0.100087 |  winning a throw in 10 yards inside their own half Kyle Walker they the latest left back with
[6199.68 - 6204.32] P:1702.64 E:0.101688 |  England have run through a few haven't they in recent times with uh with Luke Shaw's injury
[6205.52 - 6210.64] P:1657.40 E:0.102436 |  and uh and Anthony Gordon's also going to come on Alexander Arnold's ball in field missed
[6210.64 - 6216.72] P:1587.49 E:0.097989 |  Manu is behind him so Slovenia will mount an attack here the rare sight of Slovenia with the ball
[6216.72 - 6224.08] P:1653.20 E:0.084696 |  inside England territory here is Jan Sejla then forward towards uh the newly arrived Stankovic
[6224.96 - 6230.00] P:1539.47 E:0.097659 |  Declan Rice is able to step in Manu with a little ball back to Alexander Arnold Alexander Arnold
[6230.00 - 6235.68] P:1550.61 E:0.089071 |  down in the right back area uh to Palmer so Anthony Gordon's going to step into the tournament
[6235.68 - 6242.08] P:1639.26 E:0.106618 |  very shortly as Alexander Arnold plays it centrally to Fordham now back to Gay on the edge of the box
[6242.72 - 6248.32] P:1541.61 E:0.109095 |  if England win this match they will definitely go through as group winners searching for a late goal
[6249.12 - 6254.24] P:1526.69 E:0.108311 |  to make sure that that happens it is possible if Denmark were able to score a goal that would
[6254.24 - 6258.40] P:1487.61 E:0.105290 |  change the picture but it is still nil nil in the other match against Serbia
[6260.88 - 6269.28] P:1534.07 E:0.097134 |  here is Pickford passing it forward towards Declan Rice now Foden in the center circle
[6269.28 - 6271.76] P:1693.48 E:0.093649 |  Foden just moves away from
[6273.76 - 6280.80] P:1867.45 E:0.105027 |  Cherine Walker gets it onto his right foot high crossfield pass from him looking for cold Palmer
[6280.80 - 6284.48] P:1814.55 E:0.114391 |  Palmer with the first handcatch then runs into Janja and wins the free kick
[6285.44 - 6289.44] P:1821.79 E:0.118713 |  well yeah I don't think Janja will be very happy with that about Palmer running to him yeah it's
[6289.44 - 6294.40] P:1931.47 E:0.103670 |  interesting that because uh just watching a replay here the crossfield pass and the first
[6294.48 - 6299.44] P:1806.14 E:0.102853 |  touch from cold Palmer he's absolutely delightful with the outside of his boot over the top of
[6299.44 - 6304.24] P:1799.30 E:0.096040 |  Janja and he just gets in the way doesn't he Janja it's good defending but it's actually
[6304.24 - 6309.20] P:1726.45 E:0.092191 |  blocking cold Palmer's path to get on the second phase of the ball but it's a good position for
[6309.20 - 6313.04] P:1648.48 E:0.106997 |  England and they've got Trent Alexander Arnold over the ball as well now who's delivery that was
[6313.04 - 6316.56] P:1840.26 E:0.096752 |  one of the pretty good that was one of the touches of the tournament it was a fantastic
[6316.56 - 6320.00] P:1825.41 E:0.109454 |  touch in this one playing up at their own game a little bit a little bit of taste their own medicine
[6320.00 - 6323.76] P:1848.94 E:0.107253 |  John where we went out on fouling in the attacking band as he said this is a great chance
[6323.76 - 6330.80] P:1867.99 E:0.106403 |  there to Trent Alexander Arnold on the pitch yeah 88 minute still 0-0 free kick out on the right
[6330.80 - 6338.16] P:1918.83 E:0.111667 |  hand side Foden or Alexander Arnold brilliant delivers both the referee having some final words
[6338.16 - 6344.88] P:1932.88 E:0.108897 |  Jude Bellingham a bit of pushing and shoving Foden to take left footed headed down and cleared away
[6344.88 - 6349.60] P:1752.45 E:0.108450 |  should be cleared away on the edge of the box in fact it was passed away the main new main new
[6350.56 - 6355.44] P:1831.63 E:0.119856 |  I think you thought he conceded a free kick yes he has it has been given Slovenia as well
[6355.44 - 6361.52] P:1780.76 E:0.115518 |  you can hear the anger of the the England supporters they've been wound up by Slovenia but
[6363.20 - 6367.68] P:1737.63 E:0.104450 |  not sure there was a great deal in it Stojanovic but the referee saw it as a free kick and Anthony
[6367.68 - 6373.36] P:1683.06 E:0.099282 |  Gordon now coming on to replace Phil Forden how's he done tonight Phil Forden yeah I think he's been
[6373.36 - 6377.28] P:1702.55 E:0.103292 |  better more like the Phil Forden we know he's picked up some excellent positions
[6377.92 - 6382.88] P:1717.59 E:0.112318 |  beyond the midfield line he's moved outside he's moved wide he's gone in search of the ball but
[6382.88 - 6386.96] P:1639.35 E:0.105360 |  that man there that's come on he's jogging over to the left hand side Anthony Gordon I think there's
[6386.96 - 6392.40] P:1614.54 E:0.098374 |  been a lot of England fans screaming from to be out there and he's a player I very much admire
[6392.40 - 6396.32] P:1605.60 E:0.093200 |  let's see how we can get on in these last few minutes well I think they'll they've been I think
[6396.32 - 6401.04] P:1701.99 E:0.091811 |  they'll have been you know a bit of whole home when the when the team was announced tonight and
[6401.04 - 6405.60] P:1667.18 E:0.093294 |  there was just the one change the England fans wanted to see Gordon they wanted to see Plarmand
[6405.60 - 6411.28] P:1636.24 E:0.094483 |  menu on the field and now they are still nail-nail as the ball is flicked through from the the
[6411.28 - 6416.16] P:1541.87 E:0.100736 |  ball downfield from Oblakte Jordan Pickman we're in the 90th minute now so if it's going to come late
[6417.04 - 6423.44] P:1589.12 E:0.100804 |  for England it's going to come very late mind you this has been the euros of late goals nine goals
[6423.44 - 6430.64] P:1527.14 E:0.100660 |  scored a record equaling nine goals beyond the 90th minute here is Anthony Gordon for the first time
[6430.64 - 6436.24] P:1619.87 E:0.107658 |  running at Carnicholique that is touch as he tried to play it fast and took the ball out of play
[6436.24 - 6442.32] P:1640.66 E:0.098630 |  and it's a throw into Slovenia halfway inside their own half so Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton
[6442.32 - 6447.68] P:1561.81 E:0.095517 |  standing by to take your calls I think I know what the the flavour of that will be
[6450.16 - 6454.24] P:1584.89 E:0.105137 |  and it will be on it half fast after we've wrapped everything up here
[6454.72 - 6459.52] P:1660.84 E:0.098585 |  that's a great shift for Chris Sutton it is he never he never they never closed the Sutton's
[6460.32 - 6467.76] P:1710.65 E:0.095119 |  as Janja is going to be substituted for the final minutes of the match with Balkovich coming on
[6467.76 - 6471.28] P:1775.64 E:0.096969 |  now the other point to make by the way is that this is going to see Croatia out isn't it this is
[6471.28 - 6476.96] P:1649.77 E:0.089259 |  going to confirm that Croatia will be out of the tournament and it's virtually certain that Slovenia
[6477.92 - 6484.64] P:1788.37 E:0.102297 |  had to avoid a heavy defeat so these are the last knockings of Croatia's time that euro 2024
[6486.08 - 6491.76] P:1704.52 E:0.091496 |  biggest casualties so far ball played downfield we are into added time
[6493.28 - 6497.28] P:1579.65 E:0.101793 |  four minutes of added time at the end of this game nil nil
[6497.76 - 6506.48] P:1608.58 E:0.102742 |  the stones steps forward with the ball not sure how much time there will be added on in the
[6506.48 - 6510.72] P:1540.87 E:0.105429 |  in the Denmark Serbia match whether that will finish before as probably afterwards you would have
[6510.72 - 6517.60] P:1513.39 E:0.103371 |  thought yeah five minutes have been added on there so there is the possibility if it stays like
[6517.60 - 6523.84] P:1475.75 E:0.096191 |  this that if Denmark score a late goal that would nudge England down to second in the table
[6523.84 - 6529.52] P:1572.44 E:0.092420 |  there might be some drama tonight as Alexander Arnall plays it across towards Kyle Walker
[6529.52 - 6534.48] P:1792.19 E:0.093647 |  still inside his own half but of the substitute certainly cool Palmer is will have lifted the
[6534.48 - 6540.16] P:1881.74 E:0.101027 |  spirits of the England fans that the Glenstead had of him here tonight yeah without a doubt
[6540.16 - 6544.56] P:1861.48 E:0.112324 |  he's hugging that right hand side at the moment that's a good ball from Gordon afflict the cane
[6544.56 - 6551.20] P:1819.29 E:0.110057 |  then across the Palmer left foot saved by our black who drops on it didn't quite catch it the way
[6551.20 - 6557.20] P:1657.96 E:0.109655 |  would have wanted to but arriving onto it on his left foot fantastic pass manzini Gordon I love
[6557.20 - 6562.32] P:1670.42 E:0.101872 |  the pass he drove inside played a pass zipped through the lines it's a brilliant one lovely touch
[6562.32 - 6566.48] P:1670.85 E:0.103450 |  around the corner and you just want it like the last night the only goal winning you just wanted
[6566.48 - 6571.84] P:1696.34 E:0.096246 |  to shape into that far corner and he just connected wrong with it I feel like here with the substitutes
[6571.84 - 6576.88] P:1585.27 E:0.100200 |  who've come on we're seeing a glimpse of of what England might and I know that we're always talking
[6576.88 - 6582.88] P:1638.31 E:0.100422 |  about if and might and what will they do but we've we are seeing it here tonight as football's a
[6582.88 - 6587.52] P:1430.47 E:0.103242 |  complicated game no a simple game made complicated by people that pass there for manzini Gordon
[6587.52 - 6592.48] P:1698.90 E:0.089628 |  just straight through Harry came with a little croft turn into the path of cope armor and spawn
[6592.48 - 6595.92] P:1614.83 E:0.102953 |  Connor with that shout by the way by Italy for Italy last night it's a similar chance but on the
[6595.92 - 6602.32] P:1676.08 E:0.099152 |  other side wasn't it yep it was the late goal that Italy scored so we we've got 90 seconds left
[6602.32 - 6609.92] P:1707.18 E:0.090977 |  to play still no no stays like this that's going to be a 1-0 win a 1-1 draw and a nil-nil draw for
[6609.92 - 6615.68] P:1651.07 E:0.101353 |  England in the group and I'm afraid you might not like it dear listener but the words tournament
[6615.68 - 6621.52] P:1643.10 E:0.099460 |  football will be will be mentioned again as Alexander Arnott plays it to Palmer down in the
[6621.52 - 6625.68] P:1577.02 E:0.107930 |  full back position Palmer wins it back me and who backed up Palmer Palmer to Alexander Arnott on the
[6625.68 - 6631.76] P:1733.73 E:0.112647 |  edge of the box it was a 50-50 ball and England fans want a free kick for the challenge Slovenia
[6631.76 - 6638.16] P:1608.86 E:0.108043 |  take it downfield and then gay actually runs into Kyle Walker who's okay did worry for him for a
[6638.16 - 6645.04] P:1849.83 E:0.094333 |  moment there England on the attack might be the last one Gordon Gordon with that blonde hair then
[6645.04 - 6652.00] P:1701.02 E:0.111277 |  Alexander Arnott right foot shot that high over the top by two or three yards and the goal kick
[6652.00 - 6656.96] P:1717.85 E:0.111150 |  for Slovenia with 40 seconds to go. Oh it's on Trent Alexander Arnott just picking the ball up
[6657.76 - 6662.96] P:1606.24 E:0.107241 |  in the middle of the box sorry just outside the box and he just lets fly and he's got a wonderful
[6662.96 - 6668.48] P:1653.76 E:0.106653 |  strike on him and we're urging that to nestle into the far corner it's just gone over the bar
[6668.48 - 6674.80] P:1568.20 E:0.108275 |  that was the moment. England nil Slovenia nil they wanted a statement performance
[6675.52 - 6683.52] P:1555.64 E:0.114143 |  really you have to be honest it's been far from that and the jury still will be very much out
[6684.08 - 6689.20] P:1625.57 E:0.110647 |  on how far England are capable of going in this tournament as the ball is flicked on downfield gay
[6689.20 - 6695.12] P:1755.21 E:0.111811 |  had to get there first but he did and there is the final whistle and Slovenia celebrate
[6696.00 - 6702.24] P:1714.32 E:0.115909 |  Slovenia celebrate now suddenly they're the story of the night they'll finish in third
[6703.20 - 6710.08] P:1739.01 E:0.114180 |  but they will be one of the third place qualifiers the greatest night in a tournament that Slovenia
[6710.16 - 6715.28] P:1573.08 E:0.103666 |  have ever had the first time that they've qualified for the knockout stages and they are
[6715.28 - 6721.68] P:1569.00 E:0.107645 |  celebrating appropriately nil nil three draws that's going to take them through
[6722.32 - 6728.16] P:1474.94 E:0.111563 |  and England unless we get a late goal from Denmark England are going through as group winners
[6728.80 - 6735.20] P:1535.63 E:0.113338 |  despite their toils in the group well those scenes to our right there are unbelievable for Slovenia
[6736.16 - 6740.48] P:1597.08 E:0.108512 |  like the amount of heart and grit that they put into that performance it was exceptional to watch
[6740.48 - 6745.44] P:1587.55 E:0.102036 |  at times the discipline and the coaching that's clearly gone on within their camp but on the flip
[6745.44 - 6750.08] P:1499.65 E:0.108206 |  side for England the players looked ejected they're clapping the fans because they know that
[6750.08 - 6754.40] P:1540.10 E:0.107287 |  they still haven't reached the performance levels that we all know they are capable of
[6755.52 - 6762.88] P:1606.49 E:0.108015 |  hopefully soon they will find them yeah well it couldn't be much worse for England after the
[6762.88 - 6768.80] P:1651.24 E:0.104110 |  Denmark performance for most of that match I suppose there are there are positives to be
[6768.80 - 6775.68] P:1658.72 E:0.100085 |  taken from this but England fans will want much much more in the knockout stages that
[6775.68 - 6781.68] P:1629.63 E:0.101381 |  England are through to England will play as group winners one of the third place finishers
[6781.68 - 6790.00] P:1670.28 E:0.101484 |  it looks very likely it'll be England Netherlands in the round of 16 on Sunday in Gelsenkirk and
[6790.96 - 6797.04] P:1667.04 E:0.099413 |  at five o'clock UK time that'll be confirmed but tonight England nil Slovenia nil on a very
[6797.04 - 6802.16] P:1587.67 E:0.103861 |  forgettable final night in a very forgettable group Mark Chapman let's just go straight to
[6802.16 - 6807.92] P:1585.44 E:0.108916 |  Masferiki watching Denmark against Serbia for how this is going to finish yeah and the second's
[6807.92 - 6813.20] P:1491.60 E:0.109539 |  ticking by here very nervous Denmark fans in fact the full time whistle has just gone mark and it
[6813.20 - 6819.84] P:1520.19 E:0.109030 |  has finished goalless in Munich as well Denmark nil Serbia nil Serbia really scaring Denmark late
[6819.84 - 6825.44] P:1557.42 E:0.105123 |  on really pushing for the win that they needed to try and keep their place in the tournament in
[6825.44 - 6830.96] P:1562.42 E:0.104181 |  the knockout stages going very very close Mitrovic booked as well late on for diving as well coming
[6830.96 - 6835.44] P:1573.05 E:0.101787 |  together with him in Anderson who wasn't happy as well with some of the tactics that Mitrovic was
[6835.44 - 6840.40] P:1444.30 E:0.102254 |  trying to employ to just rock Denmark's rhythm at the back in the latter stages but they have held
[6840.40 - 6845.52] P:1492.48 E:0.101689 |  on Denmark the three points we think is going to be enough for them to be in the knockout stages
[6845.52 - 6853.20] P:1467.55 E:0.106745 |  full time in Munich Denmark nil Serbia nil we are here then in Köln where it has finished
[6853.20 - 6860.64] P:1543.03 E:0.104840 |  goalless between England and Slovenia and John Murray first of all just back back to you with the
[6860.64 - 6867.12] P:1532.44 E:0.106846 |  sort of the difference in reaction between the two camps and the two sets of fans well I mean for
[6867.12 - 6871.92] P:1573.14 E:0.106922 |  Slovenia this is this is one of their greatest nights they've never had a night like this and
[6871.92 - 6875.52] P:1453.82 E:0.106862 |  for England many of the fans have left the ground there are still plenty there but Garo
[6875.52 - 6880.32] P:1505.74 E:0.106420 |  Southgate very pointedly is going out and walking on his own around in front of the
[6880.32 - 6885.04] P:1487.66 E:0.101552 |  England fans and applauding them I mean they're backing during the course of the match when you
[6885.04 - 6890.56] P:1572.59 E:0.105908 |  consider the kind of match that it was was was outstanding but the real celebrations the real
[6890.56 - 6897.36] P:1570.52 E:0.102466 |  winners here tonight are Slovenia and that they're having a real party to our right in the stands
[6897.36 - 6904.32] P:1567.18 E:0.104437 |  here in Köln everything ended goalless in group C to be honest I thought group B was
[6904.32 - 6912.24] P:1616.66 E:0.102446 |  still last night but group C both games ended goalless England and Slovenia and Denmark and
[6912.24 - 6918.80] P:1679.81 E:0.098200 |  Serbia and we are going to be left now and everybody is going to be left here Conor we're
[6918.80 - 6927.52] P:1827.78 E:0.090267 |  trying to analyse this and trying to look at this with what we've seen in front of our eyes for
[6927.52 - 6935.92] P:1819.37 E:0.088851 |  90 minutes and the bigger picture of tournament football and that's a very difficult place to
[6935.92 - 6943.92] P:1717.62 E:0.088323 |  be to analyse where England are at yes of course it is what I will say is I think all the supporters
[6943.92 - 6948.08] P:1811.31 E:0.103555 |  in here all of us here as England fans we're a little bit worried with what we're seeing and
[6948.16 - 6952.48] P:1834.68 E:0.097176 |  listen we said before the game didn't we about we wanted a reaction we felt like this was the game
[6952.48 - 6957.44] P:1873.58 E:0.100516 |  we wanted this to be the game where England really arrived on this on this huge stage at this competition
[6957.44 - 6961.84] P:1809.20 E:0.099650 |  and and go we're here England are finally here and we just got to we haven't really seen that I don't
[6961.84 - 6965.60] P:1851.03 E:0.100625 |  think there was anything really in the game I don't think England really shone there was loads of
[6965.60 - 6969.52] P:1733.87 E:0.099897 |  chances there was a cold palm on at the end that we fancied and we wanted them to go and score for him
[6969.52 - 6973.92] P:1667.41 E:0.102316 |  because I thought he was great when he come on but you've got to give credit to Slovenia and we don't
[6973.92 - 6978.72] P:1516.32 E:0.106927 |  want to say that as England fans and funded commentating on on England games we want to work
[6978.72 - 6982.32] P:1677.27 E:0.104361 |  lyrical about England but looking at Slovenia here celebrate with a fan and we want that for our
[6982.32 - 6988.72] P:1474.21 E:0.105076 |  England team as well I'm just going through the best placed sides in third at the moment
[6990.08 - 6996.24] P:1630.01 E:0.105025 |  Slovakia still have a game to play now presuming in their last game that they don't get absolutely
[6996.24 - 7003.84] P:1690.44 E:0.092443 |  pumped they are likely to be in that's Slovakia not not not Slovenia Slovakia so you would be
[7003.84 - 7012.96] P:1632.55 E:0.099959 |  looking at Netherlands Slovakia and Slovenia all guaranteed in the last 16th so then it comes down
[7012.96 - 7019.52] P:1615.78 E:0.094118 |  to where the group F can get past Hungary Croatia are gone definitely it's whether
[7020.08 - 7026.56] P:1681.86 E:0.091903 |  Czech Republic or Georgia could get to four points and that would take Hungary out so you're left
[7026.56 - 7031.92] P:1699.35 E:0.092208 |  with two options really as far as England are concerned as long as I've got this right John
[7031.92 - 7036.32] P:1717.21 E:0.101175 |  Maurice D. Wood he normally does here absolving any responsibility in about to walk off and
[7036.32 - 7041.68] P:1697.91 E:0.098610 |  I've got to go and interview Karastassia. I know but as I understand it if it just comes down to
[7041.68 - 7047.52] P:1647.33 E:0.101911 |  whether a team in group F can take Hungary out it leads England with two possibilities
[7048.72 - 7056.40] P:1521.25 E:0.098786 |  if Hungary stay in and group F don't have a best third place team England will play the Netherlands
[7056.40 - 7062.88] P:1657.53 E:0.097588 |  that will be their last 16 time if somehow Czech Republic or Georgia get to four points
[7062.88 - 7070.64] P:1557.96 E:0.095224 |  and group F take Hungary out that will leave England with the best team best the third place team
[7070.64 - 7076.96] P:1614.39 E:0.093655 |  in group E so that's the Belgian group so it's down to two now either the Netherlands or the
[7076.96 - 7082.80] P:1631.20 E:0.095024 |  team that finishes third in group E unless Slovakia get walloped but I'll we'll come to that another
[7082.80 - 7088.40] P:1760.04 E:0.088603 |  time but yes you've described that brilliantly but just as well you had a match like that
[7088.40 - 7094.24] P:1648.96 E:0.093238 |  that you had time to work it out honestly I've done normally you don't like doing that sort of thing
[7094.24 - 7101.20] P:1818.18 E:0.096777 |  the two Sudoku's have done that now he's done it today on the train and what's happened to you
[7101.20 - 7105.36] P:1711.09 E:0.105392 |  with your crossword wasn't it with the colourful pillars inside this stadium reminds me of a
[7105.36 - 7109.68] P:1612.97 E:0.103276 |  Rubik's cube I wondered whether you had one of those with you as well now that I really would
[7109.76 - 7113.36] P:1752.00 E:0.099881 |  struggle with I've never looked perfect never would have been perfect it would have been it would
[7113.36 - 7117.92] P:1741.32 E:0.097695 |  have been what's your overall view well firstly might drop for you chappers that was an absolutely
[7117.92 - 7122.08] P:1754.72 E:0.101943 |  exceptional delivery of the permutations I'm very glad John Murray is still here because
[7122.08 - 7128.24] P:1674.01 E:0.105343 |  permutations are not my strong point but overall my view on England is you know I completely reiterate
[7128.24 - 7133.36] P:1620.53 E:0.106955 |  what Conor said I think there are a lot of England fans left a little bit confused after that a little
[7133.36 - 7140.56] P:1663.52 E:0.107447 |  bit uncertain but listen tournament football the good old cliche is England is still writing it
[7140.56 - 7145.68] P:1712.04 E:0.097139 |  and one of the massive positives is the substitutes and the second one is there's another game to go
[7145.68 - 7151.12] P:1806.64 E:0.093236 |  at least one other game are the substitutes the biggest positive for you Joe Hart who's joined
[7151.12 - 7157.44] P:1642.40 E:0.100942 |  us again in the Berlin studio I'm still rattled from the first substitute yeah look I think they
[7158.24 - 7163.12] P:1545.15 E:0.106263 |  I think they look sharp I think I think Kobe Mainu delivered a really good performance in the
[7163.12 - 7169.20] P:1614.25 E:0.094723 |  second half what I think what was interesting was when we knew who was coming on it was you know
[7169.20 - 7175.76] P:1700.79 E:0.101340 |  I had no idea who was coming off but it was exciting to see the guys come on even obviously Anthony
[7175.76 - 7181.12] P:1607.55 E:0.102370 |  Gordon he didn't get much time but Cole Park Cole Palmer looked really cool and you know what a lovely
[7181.12 - 7184.72] P:1594.39 E:0.107244 |  player he really he really makes things happen doesn't he without looking like he's making any
[7184.72 - 7191.36] P:1681.84 E:0.103569 |  effort it's exceptional to watch obviously Phil Foden really really tried to take the game by the
[7191.36 - 7196.00] P:1680.16 E:0.103269 |  scruff of the neck and if anyone was gonna if anyone was gonna take control it looked like him
[7197.12 - 7201.84] P:1764.21 E:0.104079 |  but yeah yeah that was um that was an interesting second half an interesting first half but
[7202.56 - 7206.88] P:1779.92 E:0.102436 |  you know as Izzy's just said I think we've just got to take the first place and and look to keep
[7206.88 - 7214.48] P:1776.29 E:0.086571 |  building we we know what happens in these situations now Izzy the sub comes on and and and
[7214.48 - 7219.44] P:1695.55 E:0.096256 |  dude does fairly well and Cole Palmer certainly brought the energy to that when he came on for
[7219.44 - 7225.28] P:1670.07 E:0.098867 |  Bacchaiosacken so we've been here in club four before and in international before the Clamor be now
[7225.84 - 7231.28] P:1727.33 E:0.097824 |  Palmer to start Mainu to start that they will be the tip bit difficult to tell Anthony Gordon because
[7231.28 - 7238.96] P:1731.94 E:0.091794 |  he had you know I mean it basically but we know how it works and yet sometimes you can have more
[7238.96 - 7244.56] P:1659.43 E:0.092514 |  impact as a sub if the other team have been tired for an hour so it's difficult one it's very difficult
[7244.56 - 7250.00] P:1682.38 E:0.091215 |  and I think obviously the cry will be cop Palmer has to start like you say but I think that the
[7250.00 - 7254.40] P:1608.27 E:0.092285 |  thinking is much deeper than that it's much deeper than he's had an impact for 20 minutes the thinking
[7254.40 - 7260.16] P:1669.88 E:0.089341 |  is what does the next opponent look like who have we got how do they play and that's Garis Southgate's
[7260.16 - 7266.08] P:1766.68 E:0.083440 |  job and his technical coaching staff is picking the right 11 with the best tools to unlock that
[7266.08 - 7270.72] P:1687.29 E:0.086016 |  team and to beat them in front of them and again I think that that's what makes the best managers
[7270.72 - 7274.56] P:1659.57 E:0.089697 |  great because you've got the Pep Guardiola's of the world who have a system and they dominate the
[7274.56 - 7278.48] P:1735.35 E:0.094939 |  system so well that it destroys anybody in front of them but then you've got some managers who are
[7278.48 - 7284.08] P:1733.39 E:0.089055 |  willing to adapt and I think England now they need to start adapting and looking at which players
[7284.08 - 7288.96] P:1720.34 E:0.089266 |  are going to unlock the opposition which players are going to cause damage and if that means dropping
[7288.96 - 7292.72] P:1603.84 E:0.089487 |  big names that doesn't matter because the team is the most important thing for England.
[7293.52 - 7298.00] P:1672.39 E:0.095751 |  Do you think the players they'll be interested to see who comes out and talks Joe will be in a
[7298.00 - 7302.64] P:1635.70 E:0.095302 |  sort of similar situation to what I said up at the start here that you're trying to balance
[7303.36 - 7307.60] P:1635.29 E:0.094598 |  another tough performance to watch in a lot of places with qualifying.
[7309.04 - 7312.72] P:1632.80 E:0.109222 |  Yeah look there's no doubt that they're gonna they're gonna try and hammer home the point that
[7312.72 - 7318.16] P:1493.92 E:0.094110 |  they've qualified and they've qualified as qualified at the top of the group other other you know big
[7318.16 - 7323.04] P:1660.59 E:0.097227 |  countries have struggled we looked at those games earlier this afternoon you know just seeing how
[7323.04 - 7327.60] P:1533.24 E:0.090198 |  France have ended up in second place and things like that but it's going to be a it's a tough
[7327.60 - 7333.28] P:1528.44 E:0.100252 |  interview trust me as a player who has been part of teams and part of England teams who are expected
[7333.28 - 7340.32] P:1588.39 E:0.091227 |  to do well and often in the first couple of games you have this noise and you what you personally I
[7340.32 - 7344.08] P:1733.43 E:0.106883 |  don't know how you feel kind of when you've been in these situations you do literally feel like a
[7344.08 - 7349.44] P:1470.81 E:0.099276 |  performance is around the corner you 100% believe that and feel that but for the you know for a third
[7349.44 - 7353.28] P:1445.80 E:0.102117 |  game to not be quite the level that everyone wants to be at it's a really really tough interview
[7353.28 - 7358.32] P:1605.31 E:0.089742 |  it's a really good what's a big test for them as a squad and as a team but look they've just got
[7358.32 - 7363.04] P:1521.57 E:0.099596 |  sick together they've got to believe in what they're doing they've got almost almost really really
[7363.04 - 7367.76] P:1670.88 E:0.092545 |  double down now and just have each other's backs you've got to have each other's backs in these
[7367.76 - 7371.92] P:1590.84 E:0.100379 |  situation you've got to you've got to you've got to be realistic of course you have and you've got
[7372.00 - 7378.72] P:1627.90 E:0.088625 |  to accept that you can do better but um yeah stay tight stay tight boys yeah I agree with
[7378.72 - 7382.64] P:1742.40 E:0.095142 |  hearty and the one thing that you look around when you go in and you are going through these
[7382.64 - 7385.36] P:1645.77 E:0.102922 |  periods is you look around at each other you go right what we've got in the dressing room
[7385.36 - 7388.08] P:1619.96 E:0.101132 |  and looking at that dressing room it's one of the best dressing rooms they'll probably sit in
[7388.08 - 7392.16] P:1597.94 E:0.097482 |  ever in the career because the players in there are unbelievable so so that's got to give them
[7392.16 - 7396.16] P:1674.87 E:0.098132 |  confidence but listen there's no beating around a bushing in a tough moment during a tough moment
[7396.16 - 7400.00] P:1544.44 E:0.090064 |  before they come to this competition because I think it was one one winning five and now it's
[7400.00 - 7403.12] P:1604.45 E:0.096993 |  one winning three in the competition so they are in a tough moment but like I said they've
[7403.12 - 7406.96] P:1570.15 E:0.096511 |  got to get in that dressing room look around at each other and go right where are we going what can
[7406.96 - 7410.96] P:1672.50 E:0.091483 |  we do and because like I said they're probably in the best dressing room they'll ever sit in
[7410.96 - 7414.72] P:1559.35 E:0.096941 |  in the careers so they've got to get the most out of that I think they need to adopt it and
[7414.72 - 7419.20] P:1664.37 E:0.085775 |  and nothing gets out and nothing gets in to our camp now I think they've got to have that because
[7419.84 - 7425.04] P:1824.48 E:0.087031 |  there's been a lot said which is okay and there's been a lot of response off the back of that
[7425.04 - 7430.32] P:1762.11 E:0.097434 |  and I think where they're at now is they need absolute 110 focus and I'm sure they are focused
[7430.32 - 7435.04] P:1735.11 E:0.082437 |  as I'm absolutely not questioning that at all but I think the players need to just completely
[7435.04 - 7440.40] P:1761.80 E:0.093089 |  strip everything down to their bare bones simplify the game simplify the thinking around it simplify
[7440.40 - 7445.04] P:1824.31 E:0.089360 |  the preparation and just focus on the basics of what they are good at and then bring that to the
[7445.04 - 7449.76] P:1773.25 E:0.091788 |  next match because the likelihood is the next match is going to be against an opposition who are
[7449.76 - 7455.04] P:1744.92 E:0.080061 |  higher ranked than Slovakia and they're going to have to put in a performance sorry Slovenian
[7455.04 - 7460.24] P:1781.14 E:0.096794 |  they had 12 shots Joe did England only four on target the only one I can remember in the second
[7460.24 - 7466.08] P:1685.23 E:0.085275 |  half was the one that Oblak saved from Palmer at the end I can't remember off there I think all
[7466.08 - 7474.96] P:1703.18 E:0.086693 |  the others came in the first half the other thing you know they played tonight 746 passes compared
[7475.68 - 7481.84] P:1705.98 E:0.085851 |  to 272 from Slovenia and yet were they too cautious for you at times
[7482.80 - 7488.00] P:1480.99 E:0.106742 |  but they were looking they were looking to really make it difficult for Slovenia I thought Slovenia
[7488.00 - 7492.64] P:1537.73 E:0.099353 |  you know codes as a center half I think they made some they really did make some key interceptions
[7492.64 - 7496.64] P:1552.41 E:0.098480 |  at the last at the last minute number six in the middle you know just got his head on a few things
[7496.64 - 7501.36] P:1610.79 E:0.096119 |  just as Harry Kane was about to finish obviously that great ball in from Kieran Trippier it was
[7501.36 - 7507.36] P:1546.16 E:0.100090 |  if spots and maybe moments no real we never really sliced them open obviously I think I think
[7507.36 - 7513.04] P:1547.65 E:0.083761 |  second half it's key sorry is it sorry Joe when they did they they got through on goal and it was
[7513.04 - 7518.16] P:1686.32 E:0.093799 |  a sequence of two or three passes and sometimes like building up great but if you can go and hurt
[7518.16 - 7522.96] P:1778.63 E:0.094679 |  the opposition hurt them yeah agreed and I think they were going down the route of trying to tire
[7522.96 - 7528.08] P:1676.89 E:0.093863 |  them and it was there was an interchange there was folding in the middle there was belling them out
[7528.08 - 7533.12] P:1719.48 E:0.098241 |  on the left I think obviously second half I don't think Slovenia got near our goal there was a few
[7533.12 - 7537.92] P:1656.39 E:0.090302 |  you know a few long balls up front that three or four of our lads were dealing with one so the
[7537.92 - 7544.08] P:1636.49 E:0.097129 |  pressure was there but yeah just just didn't quite find that opening and when they did a little toe
[7544.08 - 7549.84] P:1602.68 E:0.087258 |  or a head you know put a stop to it I agree what I was saying at halftime so I think we're lacking a
[7549.84 - 7553.44] P:1641.83 E:0.096643 |  little bit of confidence I do I've been in that position as a player I think we all have is haven't
[7553.44 - 7557.04] P:1653.43 E:0.094987 |  we Hart you were you are lacking that confidence you're lacking that little bit of an edge you're
[7557.04 - 7561.52] P:1576.60 E:0.088497 |  lacking that little bit of a mind just to play a wrist through the lines or it became a little
[7561.52 - 7565.04] P:1499.03 E:0.097010 |  bit too easy at times we were passing 10 yards passes back to Declan Rice we'll go out the other
[7565.04 - 7568.88] P:1560.72 E:0.093758 |  side I just didn't want to gain that confidence but we've got to believe in each other like I said
[7568.88 - 7571.76] P:1689.34 E:0.097771 |  sitting that dressing room and go right what are we going to do here we need to be strong enough to
[7571.76 - 7576.24] P:1703.77 E:0.087633 |  stand up as men and go right let's get back to taking wrists fireballs through lines if it means
[7576.24 - 7579.44] P:1662.51 E:0.095724 |  giving it to Col Palmer going 1v1 we mentioned in the first half as he didn't worry about the full
[7579.44 - 7583.36] P:1557.21 E:0.092757 |  back being on a yellow card it was only when Col Palmer come on did we actually then start running
[7583.36 - 7587.04] P:1626.80 E:0.091679 |  at the full back to have a go that becomes game management so I do think we're lacking
[7587.04 - 7590.80] P:1545.99 E:0.091224 |  in confidence and that's got to come back quick going into what our bigger games down the knockout
[7590.80 - 7597.04] P:1709.02 E:0.094965 |  stage okay by the way tonight Jordan Pitfors kept more clean sheets at a major tournament than any
[7597.04 - 7603.12] P:1695.03 E:0.090903 |  goalkeeper in England's history that's that's his stats are racking up Joe aren't they before we
[7603.12 - 7608.48] P:1698.04 E:0.087648 |  let you go yeah credit to him obviously that's a that's a great achievement but you know Jordan's
[7608.48 - 7613.52] P:1653.31 E:0.092315 |  definitely well I'm almost certain that his mindset isn't going to be about if he didn't
[7613.52 - 7617.76] P:1529.80 E:0.092155 |  keep a clean sheet in England won this tournament that that would be all that mattered to him obviously
[7617.76 - 7622.96] P:1659.54 E:0.094943 |  clean sheets mean that gives your team a chance but now with that with the caps and and the clean
[7622.96 - 7626.16] P:1703.77 E:0.101882 |  sheets that he's got to his name in big major tournaments he's just going to want to he's
[7626.16 - 7630.64] P:1736.34 E:0.086393 |  going to want a medal to put around his neck to have something to show for it. Joe thank you
[7630.64 - 7637.20] P:1731.68 E:0.100519 |  see you soon Joe's off to do you do tv highlights. It's tuning guys. That's why he stays in Berlin
[7637.20 - 7641.84] P:1648.93 E:0.094715 |  that's why he stays in Berlin. We'll be tuning in Jack. I'm guessing I'm guessing you might
[7642.96 - 7646.16] P:1701.18 E:0.100814 |  because it's the highlights because England have played do you have to start with England?
[7647.44 - 7652.48] P:1730.14 E:0.098991 |  Of course we do of course we do. We're going to pick into it and there's going to be positivity
[7652.48 - 7657.28] P:1745.62 E:0.099371 |  don't you worry about that. Absolutely but once they've done that Netherlands Austria is well worth
[7657.28 - 7664.16] P:1731.03 E:0.098676 |  watching. Thank you Joe. Talk to you later. Joe Hart with us on Five Life. Let's go down to the tunnel
[7664.16 - 7670.96] P:1627.74 E:0.090349 |  and John Murray. And first up tonight is the England captain Harry Kane. Congratulations Harry
[7670.96 - 7674.96] P:1525.92 E:0.093381 |  top of the group. That's what you come here to do isn't it but that was a tough night wasn't it?
[7674.96 - 7678.80] P:1718.56 E:0.099726 |  Absolutely I think yeah we can be proud of finishing top. It's not easy in these major
[7678.80 - 7683.12] P:1728.74 E:0.098301 |  tournaments as you've seen with other nations other big nations in the tournament already
[7683.12 - 7687.52] P:1692.01 E:0.091247 |  not finishing top so we can enjoy this for sure. It was a tough game. I thought it's probably our
[7687.52 - 7691.52] P:1661.99 E:0.095877 |  best performance out the three. I thought we was definitely had more energy without the ball. We
[7691.52 - 7696.24] P:1702.50 E:0.082412 |  pressed better. We counter pressed better which allowed us to have wave after wave. We just
[7696.24 - 7701.12] P:1635.56 E:0.097813 |  lacked a bit of magic in the final third but yeah that'll come. Another good clean sheet which we're
[7701.12 - 7705.36] P:1661.73 E:0.094382 |  going to need if we want to go far in this tournament that's for sure. So credit to the boys for that
[7706.00 - 7710.56] P:1610.87 E:0.092113 |  and yeah we enjoy it and move on to the next round. Yeah it was how should I describe it a
[7710.56 - 7715.60] P:1753.16 E:0.101717 |  little tentative in the early stages. Do you think that was a legacy of everything that's happened
[7715.76 - 7721.60] P:1638.85 E:0.093713 |  Denmark performance? I'm not too sure. You know all three performances have been different to
[7721.60 - 7726.96] P:1694.37 E:0.096130 |  start the game. Obviously Serbia we started well. Denmark we didn't start too bad too good.
[7726.96 - 7731.20] P:1559.44 E:0.090476 |  Today we didn't start great but I thought you know after 10 minutes we really drew into the game and
[7731.20 - 7735.04] P:1684.55 E:0.093799 |  the longer the first half went on the space it started to get bigger and we got into more
[7735.04 - 7739.28] P:1583.01 E:0.095540 |  dangerous areas and then that continued in the second half and the subs who come on made a good
[7739.28 - 7744.00] P:1681.43 E:0.087760 |  difference made bring a lot of energy and then like I said we just couldn't quite find that final
[7744.64 - 7749.52] P:1573.45 E:0.089381 |  pass but yeah hopefully that will come the knockout rounds. Yeah I mean are you going to
[7750.80 - 7755.68] P:1596.23 E:0.101143 |  tell me that you can grow into this tournament? Well I think if you look at previous tournaments
[7755.68 - 7759.20] P:1750.81 E:0.094149 |  for sure we started to play some of our best football in the knockout rounds the last year
[7759.20 - 7764.24] P:1704.34 E:0.096198 |  was against Germany against Ukraine and then Denmark and even the World Cup against Senegal
[7764.96 - 7770.00] P:1701.90 E:0.092429 |  in the knockout first knockout round so yeah for sure there's more to come I think always the
[7770.00 - 7773.28] P:1745.39 E:0.094560 |  objective to start the tournament is get through the group you don't want to have no mishaps and then
[7774.08 - 7777.84] P:1605.23 E:0.089216 |  you know your third place waiting to see what happens we finished top we've done our
[7777.84 - 7781.84] P:1595.84 E:0.096019 |  main objective yeah we can improve we know that but you've got to enjoy these moments major
[7781.84 - 7788.16] P:1546.30 E:0.092039 |  tournaments are really hard really difficult and to finish top is not easy. Yeah and just finally
[7788.16 - 7791.68] P:1615.54 E:0.102988 |  now you've won the group you know that you can't play another group winner until the
[7791.68 - 7796.96] P:1554.51 E:0.102267 |  semi-final looks as though might well be Netherlands in the last 16. Yeah I mean look whoever we get
[7796.96 - 7800.88] P:1615.16 E:0.096379 |  can be it's going to be a tough game as this group's showing and I think the whole every group
[7800.88 - 7805.44] P:1619.30 E:0.099234 |  that you've watched so far in this tournament there's some really good teams really well organized
[7805.44 - 7810.72] P:1698.88 E:0.096661 |  teams there's no easy game now in this type of competition so yeah whoever it is obviously we'll
[7810.72 - 7816.32] P:1552.30 E:0.095921 |  do what we always do prepare well debrief well and then yeah it's knockout football now it's the
[7816.32 - 7821.20] P:1591.78 E:0.086814 |  important start important part of the tournament where it all counts so yeah hopefully we can build
[7821.20 - 7825.76] P:1572.63 E:0.086929 |  a bit of momentum going into the knockout rounds. Harry Kane thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
[7826.72 - 7833.04] P:1739.81 E:0.086627 |  He said they've got to enjoy it and they've got to celebrate it it did feel muted at the
[7833.04 - 7838.00] P:1526.40 E:0.091302 |  end though didn't it is he? Yeah and he's obviously got to come out the the England captain Harry
[7838.00 - 7842.40] P:1674.25 E:0.094709 |  Harry Kane to to be positive because you know they're all on a journey together and they want to win
[7842.40 - 7847.84] P:1698.78 E:0.087010 |  this tournament but obviously the the England fans and we can we can only assess you know from the
[7847.84 - 7852.24] P:1626.50 E:0.088008 |  outside what we see and obviously the game I think just leaves a little bit of disappointment
[7852.24 - 7857.20] P:1643.36 E:0.089681 |  because of exactly the talent that there is in that team but you know Harry Kane he comes out you
[7857.20 - 7860.80] P:1680.03 E:0.087445 |  know whether they win lose or draw and he speaks honestly he speaks from the heart and
[7860.80 - 7865.68] P:1685.81 E:0.094272 |  the lads were talking about him earlier weren't they about what a leader he is and how he communicates
[7865.68 - 7870.00] P:1587.45 E:0.088001 |  with the players and I think they just need a little bit of a reset they need to go again and
[7870.00 - 7874.48] P:1657.54 E:0.089668 |  obviously they need everybody in that squad the big players in particular to step right up and be
[7874.48 - 7880.24] P:1660.30 E:0.088513 |  counted. Gonna go back down to the tunnel we've got John Sones next I think John. Yeah it is
[7880.24 - 7886.64] P:1770.81 E:0.093036 |  John Sones winner of his 75th cap tonight John you've you started all of these tournament matches
[7886.64 - 7892.72] P:1656.92 E:0.097233 |  under Gareth Southgate so you're the ideal man to put into context this England finishing top of
[7892.72 - 7897.68] P:1411.55 E:0.092479 |  the group I know there'll be grumblers about the performance but come on give us a proper overview.
[7897.68 - 7905.20] P:1475.52 E:0.085099 |  I was super pleased to top the group so what we came here to achieve the first kind of stage of
[7905.20 - 7912.08] P:1556.54 E:0.090064 |  the tournament and I'm super proud of the players with what we've achieved two clean sheets which is
[7912.88 - 7918.32] P:1553.59 E:0.099917 |  so important in tournament football you know we can feel the tension from a small minority in the
[7918.32 - 7923.04] P:1541.56 E:0.091522 |  stands and that's to be expected you know we want to win games as well we're out there fighting for
[7923.04 - 7929.36] P:1572.40 E:0.082654 |  each other fighting for the shirt you know trying to live everyone's dream through us
[7929.84 - 7936.80] P:1479.72 E:0.085369 |  and we know we've got to improve and do better I thought tonight was a great step in in the right
[7936.80 - 7943.84] P:1398.85 E:0.091981 |  direction a lot of emotions and a lot of pressure on the game and I thought we handled that really
[7943.84 - 7948.56] P:1437.90 E:0.096219 |  well not the outcome that we want as I said before to we wanted the three points to top the group
[7948.56 - 7954.80] P:1397.78 E:0.093859 |  shouldn't be underestimated. It's not been quite like this before has it under Gareth Southgate
[7954.88 - 7958.24] P:1515.74 E:0.098060 |  under Gareth Southgate as a tournament the last few days that you've had?
[7958.24 - 7967.04] P:1532.55 E:0.093496 |  Yeah no it hasn't and it is what it is you know we're here to try and win and get everyone behind
[7967.04 - 7974.16] P:1482.41 E:0.085936 |  us and as I said do everyone proud think it's a little kid I keep taking it back to when I was
[7974.16 - 7982.40] P:1370.14 E:0.088946 |  a little kid sorry I got a little photo of me and my dad sent out here I was signing for
[7982.56 - 7988.32] P:1581.76 E:0.095077 |  Bansley funding it off in an England kit and it hit home you know I was that boy watching the
[7988.32 - 7994.88] P:1426.61 E:0.090873 |  England team now I'm the person in the other shoes and I want to do everyone proud at home
[7995.52 - 7999.68] P:1470.41 E:0.100029 |  as does everyone else and we want to we want to deliver for everyone we want to deliver for ourselves
[7999.68 - 8004.72] P:1504.76 E:0.095649 |  we want to keep improving and we want to achieve something that's never been done before.
[8004.72 - 8009.52] P:1559.33 E:0.099708 |  And it was Gareth Southgate who played you in all of these tournaments how much do you want to
[8009.60 - 8012.96] P:1561.53 E:0.083636 |  do it for him because he's been under the pump this week?
[8012.96 - 8018.88] P:1595.99 E:0.096681 |  Yeah 100% I think we're so together and I think he's a great character of how he controls everything
[8018.88 - 8026.56] P:1506.37 E:0.089064 |  his motions the outside pressure and we can't control that you know that's something that
[8028.56 - 8034.40] P:1467.15 E:0.095332 |  we shouldn't get involved David I don't think we have excuse me we could have been a totally
[8034.40 - 8042.40] P:1422.24 E:0.084964 |  different outcome tonight and how we played the game that outcome as I said before you know wasn't
[8042.40 - 8050.40] P:1441.03 E:0.088264 |  the three points but another clean sheet and clean sheets in tournament football is so important
[8050.40 - 8056.56] P:1567.36 E:0.094205 |  especially in the last year of roles I think that was something like one or three goals in 20
[8057.36 - 8063.20] P:1631.44 E:0.097596 |  something games in I'm not sure it was about something like yeah and something I'm extremely
[8063.20 - 8067.36] P:1397.78 E:0.086297 |  proud of because that's a base that's a platform for the lads who you know go and show their
[8067.36 - 8072.00] P:1516.11 E:0.090112 |  flair and their skill and score goals and try and win as games and we know we've got
[8072.00 - 8078.40] P:1603.99 E:0.079461 |  improvement to do this week on the training pitch and we'll be self-critical of everything
[8078.40 - 8081.36] P:1331.70 E:0.083488 |  and you know look to to make that step forward again.
[8081.36 - 8085.60] P:1496.51 E:0.092011 |  Lovely thanks John and well done on the 75 John Stone's mark.
[8087.12 - 8090.88] P:1715.79 E:0.079943 |  Thank you John I think you found that interview quite difficult John
[8090.96 - 8095.28] P:1682.17 E:0.099790 |  Stones that don't touch on that. I've never known John money to take it.
[8095.28 - 8100.88] P:1748.89 E:0.082781 |  No no but I think again he was trying to he was trying to find the right path through that.
[8101.60 - 8106.32] P:1712.22 E:0.087587 |  Yeah yeah I think he was I think he's trying to find the positives out of it all like I think
[8106.32 - 8109.60] P:1739.68 E:0.091003 |  all England boys will do I think everybody will try and find the positives out of it I think that's
[8109.60 - 8113.12] P:1748.82 E:0.087852 |  the best thing to do but like I said I think as long as they know in that dressing room like
[8113.12 - 8117.04] P:1812.92 E:0.077908 |  like John Stones mentioned a few times there how important it is to improve before the next one
[8117.04 - 8120.88] P:1767.25 E:0.087513 |  because now it gets really tough now we look at it I think we've all been there is where you go
[8120.88 - 8124.80] P:1698.41 E:0.087319 |  through and you go right now the real business starts this is where it goes it's now or never
[8124.80 - 8128.56] P:1764.97 E:0.084391 |  we get it done because you can be sat there after the game comes Sunday and you can be going on the
[8128.56 - 8132.00] P:1803.19 E:0.084522 |  next day if it's not done right so now's where it gets really hard and you've got to make sure
[8132.00 - 8135.28] P:1789.13 E:0.091423 |  to do it properly and I think he was alluding to that but it's a hard one straight after the game
[8135.28 - 8138.48] P:1708.21 E:0.093353 |  honestly I've been here when you get get put a microphone in your face and it's right go on
[8138.48 - 8141.36] P:1621.91 E:0.078625 |  off your pot and it's tough when when you just had a performance like that.
[8141.92 - 8148.72] P:1815.93 E:0.076672 |  After the second game against Denmark some of the reaction from the players and staff was
[8149.60 - 8155.44] P:1853.05 E:0.089399 |  a tiny bit emotionally charged I think in a response and that interview there with John
[8155.44 - 8158.80] P:1674.67 E:0.093466 |  Stones was quite emotionally charged to me he spoke a lot about you know what it means to
[8158.80 - 8164.72] P:1748.45 E:0.077579 |  play for English which of course is the greatest honor as a footballer but I would say at this
[8164.72 - 8168.96] P:1696.46 E:0.087902 |  present just you know the angle I'm looking at it I think the emotion needs to be removed from it
[8169.52 - 8176.16] P:1858.83 E:0.075109 |  I think it needs to be a pragmatic approach simple effective basic instructions and just
[8176.16 - 8180.56] P:1654.34 E:0.092384 |  go back to what you're good at and I think that the whole trying to do the nation proud will come
[8180.56 - 8184.24] P:1783.38 E:0.077816 |  if you get the bits right on the pitch so I think they're close and they've obviously got to come
[8184.24 - 8188.56] P:1668.29 E:0.082252 |  out and be positive but I think just remove a little bit the emotion and focus on what's next.
[8189.28 - 8194.24] P:1689.52 E:0.089790 |  Earlier on when I was going through who England might play and how the best third place teams
[8194.88 - 8200.16] P:1857.43 E:0.083041 |  might fall into place which you both seem to enjoy at the back of my mind there was a huge
[8200.16 - 8207.04] P:1837.76 E:0.081123 |  doubt about who had actually finished second in this group and in the end and this this is why not
[8207.04 - 8212.48] P:1838.39 E:0.081832 |  that you know I'm making excuses and Mazfruicci could take this on it actually came down to a
[8212.48 - 8219.04] P:1866.40 E:0.081702 |  yellow card and a yellow card that Slovenia got for that pulling back of Harry Kane with about 10
[8219.04 - 8226.72] P:1851.58 E:0.075333 |  15 minutes ago and I think that late yellow card has helped Denmark finish second but Maz maybe
[8226.72 - 8231.20] P:1758.62 E:0.088033 |  you're better briefed than me. I've been trying to do this for about 10 15 minutes which is why I
[8231.20 - 8236.56] P:1661.98 E:0.085754 |  said I think when it finished no-nil between Denmark and Serbia that that was enough for Denmark but
[8236.56 - 8241.28] P:1869.24 E:0.085672 |  yeah just to outline how tight it is you're absolutely right the most interesting thing really
[8241.28 - 8244.88] P:1584.77 E:0.087574 |  about this game tonight is just how tight it was between Denmark finishing second and Slovenia
[8244.88 - 8248.88] P:1654.62 E:0.088078 |  finishing second so with group C complete both Denmark and Slovenia finished with the same points
[8248.88 - 8254.40] P:1684.36 E:0.081353 |  tally the same goal difference the same goals scored and the same disciplinary record across the
[8254.40 - 8260.56] P:1720.03 E:0.082070 |  three games they played so players both picked up six cautions in total across the three matches so
[8260.56 - 8265.60] P:1694.86 E:0.085681 |  nothing to separate them there the next tiebreaker we look at is who has the best qualifying record
[8265.60 - 8270.08] P:1774.69 E:0.089910 |  these two sides were actually in the same qualifying group and they both finished on the same number
[8270.24 - 8276.48] P:1726.56 E:0.088098 |  of points too but Denmark finished above Slovenia on their head-to-head record so that's why Denmark
[8276.48 - 8280.56] P:1688.75 E:0.079206 |  finished second and Slovenia finished third are you still with me probably I haven't probably
[8280.56 - 8285.52] P:1773.89 E:0.102733 |  explained that very well. No you have you've explained it absolutely well on the no time in
[8285.52 - 8291.12] P:1769.90 E:0.084610 |  front of me that's absolutely spot on. So it does just explain doesn't it it just does you say how
[8291.12 - 8297.04] P:1649.07 E:0.091940 |  tight it was and there was certainly some tempers flaring late on in Munich Anderson in particular
[8297.04 - 8302.96] P:1750.23 E:0.068996 |  if he picked up a yellow then Denmark would have dropped a third and of course second in this group
[8302.96 - 8308.08] P:1663.67 E:0.084377 |  gets Germany so maybe finishing third wouldn't have been that bad maybe wouldn't have been that bad
[8308.08 - 8312.72] P:1609.56 E:0.087364 |  is there anything to say on the game or is it probably best that they how how a team is qualified
[8312.72 - 8317.12] P:1565.04 E:0.085067 |  is the most interesting conversation absolutely the most interesting thing about about this game
[8317.12 - 8322.08] P:1604.02 E:0.092006 |  completely forgettable much as it seems that as yours was as well I just think that Denmark just
[8322.08 - 8326.24] P:1708.82 E:0.090484 |  relieved really to get over the line and certainly work for them to do as well if they're going to
[8326.24 - 8330.88] P:1740.94 E:0.078325 |  challenge Germany in that game. Okay thank you very much man Denmark three and second they'll take
[8330.88 - 8336.00] P:1827.44 E:0.079638 |  on Germany England likely to get the Netherlands they could get the team who finished third in
[8336.00 - 8341.84] P:1801.16 E:0.085853 |  groupie and Slovenia go through as a best one of the best third place sides as well. Can I ask you
[8341.84 - 8346.96] P:1775.71 E:0.083438 |  a couple of tactical things you to about about this game there were several instances where I
[8346.96 - 8357.12] P:1825.65 E:0.072918 |  thought I saw players particularly out wide occupying the same three to five yards Bellingham
[8357.12 - 8363.60] P:1831.87 E:0.081172 |  and Foden in the first half a little bit main and Palmer when he came on in the second half maybe a
[8363.60 - 8370.72] P:1712.22 E:0.081629 |  little bit in the middle sometimes Foden and Bellingham. Yeah I agree with you Chappers yeah I
[8370.72 - 8373.84] P:1711.15 E:0.081075 |  think what we're seeing in this tournament in the first three games of the hour I think they both
[8373.84 - 8376.88] P:1681.61 E:0.079018 |  want to play in the same position I think they're trying to find the best out of each other so I
[8376.88 - 8381.12] P:1778.17 E:0.084977 |  think Jude or they're working on in training so I think Jude saying to Phil I'll pop outside if
[8381.12 - 8385.12] P:1814.76 E:0.083580 |  you come inside I'll occupy that space and it's just getting a little bit complicated I think as
[8385.12 - 8388.80] P:1801.04 E:0.080893 |  he said before it's just stripping it back and back to basics I actually looked at the time it was
[8388.80 - 8393.68] P:1750.90 E:0.072788 |  around 80 to 82 minutes and Phil had come inside to get on the ball and as Phil had come inside
[8393.68 - 8397.68] P:1738.83 E:0.085215 |  Trippie has then further on I think about 82 minutes I think oh my goodness earlier Trippie has gone a
[8397.68 - 8402.08] P:1637.98 E:0.085834 |  bit further on and you're thinking don't really want Trippie up there on the on the on his left foot
[8402.16 - 8407.04] P:1753.54 E:0.087806 |  in all that space you won't feel or you want a winger out there or so I just think it's
[8407.04 - 8410.32] P:1691.63 E:0.086727 |  complicated everything's complicating a little bit and I just get the feeling you both want to
[8410.32 - 8413.28] P:1668.75 E:0.085163 |  be in that same position at the minute and they're trying to get the best out of each other but it's
[8413.28 - 8417.84] P:1732.63 E:0.081555 |  hard when you both want to be in that central pitch get on the ball. Yeah from my angle what I
[8417.84 - 8422.72] P:1718.75 E:0.078166 |  see there's a lot in it and to describe on the radio without a tactics board is quite difficult
[8422.72 - 8429.52] P:1777.67 E:0.073448 |  however what I saw was I mean they've clearly been told we call overloads in football you get the
[8429.52 - 8433.36] P:1759.60 E:0.078740 |  numerical advantage in a certain area of the pitch to dominate the opposition and you want to
[8433.36 - 8436.96] P:1595.19 E:0.092807 |  work the ball because sometimes you know it's better to work the ball the ball does all the work not
[8436.96 - 8441.60] P:1778.74 E:0.077711 |  the players so that's what England have done they've gone out into wide areas they've added numbers
[8441.60 - 8445.52] P:1640.40 E:0.088334 |  out there and they've tried to dominate what they didn't do was penetrate in those areas so then what
[8445.52 - 8449.44] P:1836.11 E:0.081006 |  they've done is they've come back into central areas and then they've tried to circulate the ball
[8450.16 - 8453.76] P:1792.70 E:0.086225 |  and it's become a little bit frustrating to watch at times because it's been quite slow
[8453.76 - 8459.28] P:1776.79 E:0.075953 |  lethargic and you know not much piercing through the the heart of the defence and the other thing I
[8459.28 - 8463.76] P:1759.56 E:0.083090 |  noticed was the full back positioning cow walk and Keir and trippie on both sides at certain times
[8463.76 - 8468.64] P:1822.37 E:0.082208 |  they were almost in a centre back area and I actually would have liked to have seen them level off we
[8468.64 - 8472.96] P:1832.82 E:0.085026 |  call it what do we call it con when the full back deepens off squares off so you're parallel to your
[8472.96 - 8477.36] P:1861.26 E:0.077263 |  centre back partner because what that does is it creates a massive challenge for the wingers the
[8477.36 - 8482.48] P:1920.10 E:0.079382 |  opposition wingers and it actually ends up getting midfielders on the ball easier but what we did was
[8482.48 - 8487.04] P:1861.21 E:0.071429 |  we played into Slovakia's hands sorry Slovenia I don't know why I keep saying that it's because
[8487.12 - 8495.04] P:1938.56 E:0.079585 |  I've got it written in front of me right in a 4-4-2 and they just said we are happy here we are strong
[8495.92 - 8499.84] P:1757.70 E:0.077245 |  breakers down and they didn't and we didn't could the football could the full backs have
[8499.84 - 8505.44] P:1819.93 E:0.083592 |  overlapped more I don't think it was on to overlap because the wingers were told to get chalk on the
[8505.44 - 8511.60] P:1832.82 E:0.074196 |  boots at times but Foden's got licensed to start there but drifting Saka stayed out there and Connor
[8511.60 - 8516.24] P:1739.18 E:0.080696 |  you know nailed it half time get the ball out to Pocayo Saka and get him cutting inside so is it a
[8516.24 - 8523.12] P:1748.23 E:0.063747 |  tactical thing or is it a personnel thing? I don't think it I don't I think they'll be going through
[8523.12 - 8526.00] P:1681.44 E:0.089901 |  these things on the training pitch and I keep on I keep on saying it but when we're looking at the
[8526.00 - 8529.44] P:1586.09 E:0.087710 |  personnel we're looking at players who want to come inside we're looking at a lot of players
[8529.44 - 8533.52] P:1818.85 E:0.073164 |  we're looking at Bacchio Saka he's left footed so when you're left footed you don't often go down
[8533.52 - 8537.12] P:1819.87 E:0.081510 |  the right and cross the ball in because that's not your strong foot even though he can use his right
[8537.12 - 8542.00] P:1695.68 E:0.081804 |  foot so he's left footed so he tends to come inside the run he does really well for Arsenal is when
[8542.00 - 8545.76] P:1665.06 E:0.087603 |  Ben White who's not he's not he's not here gets on the ball he takes a run inside and Ben White
[8545.76 - 8549.28] P:1615.95 E:0.080594 |  plays into his path and he's running in his left foot they've not got them partnerships yet because
[8549.28 - 8554.32] P:1775.95 E:0.082969 |  Caliwog plays Man City or all that sort of thing so I just think it's people want to play in positions
[8554.32 - 8558.00] P:1595.41 E:0.084258 |  that they're not actually there at the minute so we've got Phil Foden coming in and things like that
[8558.00 - 8563.12] P:1783.47 E:0.088060 |  Saka plays off the right for Arsenal and he scored 16 goals last season 11 of those goals were with
[8563.12 - 8569.76] P:1736.55 E:0.071539 |  his left foot and Anthony Gordon scored the majority of his goals I think 10 out of his 11 goals this
[8569.76 - 8575.76] P:1774.74 E:0.066645 |  season with his right foot and he plays off the left for Newcastle so you've got players in there
[8575.76 - 8582.00] P:1714.72 E:0.063596 |  wide players with strengths of coming inside so we have got players that can contribute coming inside
[8582.00 - 8587.52] P:1745.72 E:0.082080 |  it's how you find the balance in the middle of the pitch and I think again nailed it I think
[8587.52 - 8593.36] P:1760.52 E:0.065934 |  Foden and Bellingham want to occupy the same spaces and this is where I'm talking about an
[8593.36 - 8598.80] P:1904.83 E:0.083360 |  act of and it's not a criticism by any means you have to take away some of your own game
[8599.44 - 8604.00] P:1800.30 E:0.080815 |  for the benefit of the team and if that means Bellingham makes continuous forward runs to
[8604.00 - 8608.88] P:1848.95 E:0.075860 |  create the space for Foden please do it if it means Foden has to actually just stay on the
[8608.88 - 8615.76] P:1724.64 E:0.072335 |  touch line do it it's just about what what works with the team to create that flow and the dynamic
[8615.76 - 8620.80] P:1663.64 E:0.073435 |  football that we want to see or the manager has to realise that he can't necessarily play
[8623.76 - 8628.00] P:1644.81 E:0.089374 |  the clamour for the players and Bellingham and Foden are the two where there will be huge
[8628.08 - 8632.16] P:1645.69 E:0.075293 |  clamour because of the season that they've had but you have to you have to pick something that
[8632.16 - 8637.60] P:1785.85 E:0.080829 |  balances your team and works for you don't you yeah you do absolutely and they're both like
[8637.60 - 8641.68] P:1655.99 E:0.076944 |  magnets to the ball they want to be on it all the time all the time they want the ball and and
[8641.68 - 8646.16] P:1753.42 E:0.086689 |  again you throw Karl Palmer into the mix and he is another player who wants the ball at his feet
[8646.16 - 8649.76] P:1734.50 E:0.079775 |  and how is that going to look if he ends up starting the next game now I know what you're
[8649.76 - 8654.72] P:1811.16 E:0.086513 |  thinking as you listen to this it's been two goalless draws it's not been that much of an
[8654.72 - 8660.64] P:1784.90 E:0.086119 |  entertaining night and as you go late into the night you need someone full of fun and Joanne
[8660.64 - 8667.44] P:1780.93 E:0.078850 |  de Viva who's going to put a smile on your face come in mystery voice um good evening I've enjoyed
[8667.44 - 8675.20] P:1660.20 E:0.080033 |  I've actually really enjoyed group C and the games tonight Mark now come on Christopher oh I'm
[8675.20 - 8680.24] P:1736.28 E:0.084837 |  lying I nearly nodded off had a hell of a day my train was three hours late eight and a half hours
[8680.24 - 8685.04] P:1695.49 E:0.074382 |  I've had on the train and had to come back and watch that well you've beaten me and Connor
[8685.04 - 8691.60] P:1697.59 E:0.081912 |  to his we as was to as took seven hours and was two and a half hours late so you've won that first
[8691.60 - 8697.76] P:1678.13 E:0.074458 |  time I've beaten you anything you won your own yes yes and and that's the worry because I don't
[8697.76 - 8702.24] P:1650.76 E:0.080715 |  speak German so I didn't actually I didn't dare get off the train and try and get another one
[8702.24 - 8707.92] P:1707.17 E:0.078433 |  because I didn't know what was going on it's quite tricky really what did you do on your own for
[8708.32 - 8714.72] P:1711.79 E:0.081415 |  I mean you know maybe this old platform part of 6 0 6 but what did you do for eight hours
[8714.72 - 8721.04] P:1723.13 E:0.071979 |  on your own on the train well I just talked to myself and sort of chuckled myself that's
[8721.04 - 8728.64] P:1576.66 E:0.074408 |  that's basically what I do Mark that's right come on Chris what did you do well I've read a book
[8728.64 - 8734.32] P:1692.58 E:0.077702 |  tell the nation what I do read I've read a book yeah I've read a book did some prep and then I was
[8734.64 - 8738.48] P:1757.48 E:0.085714 |  I was excited about the game this evening can I bring a bit of positivity
[8739.36 - 8747.76] P:1828.35 E:0.080544 |  to proceed that'll be a face Chris morning don't you start dear me so I mean so England
[8747.76 - 8752.40] P:1707.60 E:0.074614 |  haven't performed well but their objective at the start of the other group was to finish top
[8752.40 - 8757.36] P:1743.02 E:0.072424 |  they've done that look at Portugal I'm going to give George Cummings the producer credit for this
[8757.36 - 8764.08] P:1868.44 E:0.084370 |  he reminded me Portugal 2016 third in their group against Hungary Iceland Austria been Switzerland
[8764.16 - 8769.36] P:1826.19 E:0.074020 |  on penalties beat Poland on penalties beat Wales in the semi-final and then beat France
[8769.36 - 8776.32] P:1731.99 E:0.069457 |  in the finals so England haven't got going but a sort of law of averages isn't it these
[8776.32 - 8780.40] P:1759.96 E:0.083278 |  these players are too good not to get going the one thing I did I did think we all learned from
[8780.40 - 8789.44] P:1718.28 E:0.068070 |  tonight Cole Palmer has to start instead of instead of Bacchia Sacca was is he suggesting
[8789.44 - 8797.36] P:1807.78 E:0.074594 |  sort of what is listening in about maybe dropping Jude Bellingham is he really gosh Chris don't be
[8797.36 - 8803.52] P:1823.53 E:0.074422 |  ridiculous I think Bacchio Sacca needs to stay on the pitch as well by the way so you wouldn't
[8803.52 - 8809.68] P:1637.93 E:0.081388 |  you wouldn't play Palmer I mean he did more who would you drop then you can't have 12 I think
[8809.68 - 8816.00] P:1689.78 E:0.060537 |  you need to consider Foden's position I think he's been excellent I think he's wanted to get on the
[8816.00 - 8822.16] P:1772.37 E:0.069917 |  ball he's not been the Manchester City Phil Foden that we all know all about but I think you're
[8822.16 - 8828.08] P:1693.68 E:0.079597 |  going to have to drop a big name in order to get a maximum team output and there you go does
[8828.08 - 8834.64] P:1819.19 E:0.084041 |  does your positivity stretch to believing believing that England are on the right side of the draw
[8834.64 - 8838.96] P:1741.10 E:0.093011 |  yes the French yes second and isn't that disrespectful to the other sides who are on
[8838.96 - 8842.40] P:1621.57 E:0.079326 |  England side of the draw who have played some good football like Austria
[8843.36 - 8851.52] P:1802.50 E:0.066804 |  look a little bit disrespectful maybe but you know I'd keep my disrespect personal to myself
[8852.56 - 8858.08] P:1624.02 E:0.086623 |  if I was an England player I would be really excited about what has happened so far and the
[8858.08 - 8861.60] P:1640.01 E:0.086818 |  fact that they know they can play a lot better they you know these are these are players week in
[8861.60 - 8866.24] P:1684.12 E:0.082300 |  and week out who who play brilliantly in the Premier League Harry Kane scored a bundle of goals in the
[8866.72 - 8871.04] P:1731.10 E:0.070480 |  in the Bundesliga and they haven't clicked but then they look at the other side of the draw
[8871.04 - 8877.92] P:1716.47 E:0.067667 |  what Spain and Germany and France the outstanding teams in the tournaments well not France but
[8877.92 - 8885.36] P:1744.57 E:0.063635 |  but Spain and Germany and you know the fact of the matter is is there's a good chance if if Gareth
[8885.36 - 8892.00] P:1626.46 E:0.075963 |  gets things together that England can get to the final I honestly Mark I honestly believe that
[8892.00 - 8896.72] P:1691.02 E:0.076192 |  and I don't want to burst your positivity bubble but I'm going to ask all three of you
[8897.76 - 8902.72] P:1648.10 E:0.084677 |  some of these will have been friendlies is there a concern that England have only won two out of
[8902.72 - 8914.88] P:1711.21 E:0.053843 |  their last eight games in total no okay Connor Chris I love your positivity by the way I'm all for
[8914.88 - 8923.04] P:1716.16 E:0.059589 |  that I think you're gonna say yes that means yes yeah I think it is I think there is a little bit
[8923.04 - 8928.64] P:1603.62 E:0.076607 |  yet but I am I am all for it becomes serious now and I do think that they know they've got to improve
[8929.36 - 8935.60] P:1741.79 E:0.072094 |  is he same as Connor they've got to improve they've got to you're on shortly are you Chris
[8935.60 - 8940.08] P:1616.03 E:0.097354 |  what are you laughing at Chris who would have thought that I could be more positive than anybody
[8940.56 - 8949.60] P:1648.72 E:0.079572 |  that's a good I am how long's your show tonight 15 minutes hopefully there's some sort of jeery call
[8949.60 - 8957.36] P:1618.99 E:0.086520 |  us one hour one hour and no doubt we'll get the garroth haters on but but but but but honestly
[8957.36 - 8963.12] P:1739.35 E:0.077314 |  we did learn tonight I need to jump in because garroth Southgate is live with John Murray
[8963.12 - 8968.48] P:1615.79 E:0.098008 |  yes here he is England manager garroth through the group again as you have done at all of your
[8968.80 - 8973.12] P:1527.02 E:0.102600 |  tournaments when people look back at this in years to come they'll probably see England
[8973.12 - 8979.52] P:1664.04 E:0.087231 |  top of the group what how should we regard this opening to this campaign and what did you think
[8979.52 - 8987.12] P:1494.77 E:0.081025 |  of the performance tonight well I thought tonight was progress I thought we used the ball better
[8987.12 - 8992.40] P:1505.63 E:0.091511 |  we totally dominated the game particularly the second half we had them pinned in for long long periods
[8993.36 - 9001.04] P:1570.10 E:0.082612 |  I was pleased that we had enough composure not to get anxious because you know we we know what the
[9001.04 - 9008.40] P:1591.56 E:0.072852 |  last week or so has been like and in those moments where everybody's desperate for the win you can
[9008.40 - 9015.52] P:1598.35 E:0.083509 |  end up not using the ball as patiently and find yourselves in trouble so really pleased with the
[9015.52 - 9019.68] P:1587.76 E:0.087715 |  composure that was shown really pleased with the impact of all the players that came into the game
[9020.64 - 9027.04] P:1453.36 E:0.087905 |  um yes of course we did like a couple of goals to send everybody home happy but um
[9028.48 - 9032.80] P:1505.69 E:0.096217 |  in the end that wasn't to be tonight but I don't think it was for the one of the effort of the players
[9032.80 - 9038.96] P:1582.89 E:0.088026 |  or um you know the ability to open the opposition up it was probably just the finishing touch or
[9038.96 - 9044.32] P:1524.72 E:0.089750 |  the final pass a couple of times that led us down a bit how much has called Palmer impressed you
[9044.32 - 9049.36] P:1546.33 E:0.095695 |  with what he did there having having not played he's obviously had a spell without without actually
[9049.36 - 9054.72] P:1380.33 E:0.091224 |  playing in a in a competitive match and yet looked very sharp didn't he he did yeah well that's what
[9054.72 - 9060.32] P:1589.18 E:0.087607 |  we've seen in the last few days in particular in training and uh we've got good players in the squad
[9060.32 - 9068.40] P:1460.65 E:0.083553 |  and we you know don't feel we should hesitate to use them so he showed a real composure um yeah he's
[9068.40 - 9075.20] P:1386.31 E:0.088053 |  he's got a really um calm manner about him and I think that showed in the way that well both he
[9075.20 - 9080.64] P:1520.21 E:0.093599 |  and Coby the way they came into the game was two very young players has he staked a claim there to
[9080.64 - 9086.96] P:1496.59 E:0.074611 |  to start well he has been staking a claim without a doubt um you know we've got to we've got to look at
[9087.76 - 9093.44] P:1587.07 E:0.092947 |  who we play next what's the best way of going for for the next game um but it was fabulous to see
[9093.44 - 9100.88] P:1479.23 E:0.083667 |  that we need a strong bench as well these games are 95 plus minute games it's not just about uh
[9100.88 - 9105.36] P:1592.86 E:0.087615 |  the players who start you know you need players to come in and have the impact like you did you
[9105.36 - 9110.08] P:1598.76 E:0.102248 |  you made a point there of going around the the england fans and thanking them for for their
[9110.08 - 9116.56] P:1633.77 E:0.089389 |  support tonight you know how much do you need them with you bearing in mind the difficulties that
[9116.56 - 9123.20] P:1542.64 E:0.078423 |  you've had yeah look I think uh I mean they were brilliant in the second half especially you know
[9123.20 - 9132.96] P:1380.39 E:0.089368 |  there there was constant noise behind the team uh I I kind of get it they they are not happy with me
[9133.60 - 9140.16] P:1360.83 E:0.086433 |  it's the reality of that I'm not going to back away from that um they need to does that does that hurt
[9141.60 - 9151.04] P:1344.94 E:0.083475 |  look I'm not going to um it I need them behind the team and need them behind the team so it's fine
[9152.00 - 9154.96] P:1326.61 E:0.097546 |  I have to deal with what I'm dealing with I wasn't going to back away from going and
[9154.96 - 9159.92] P:1494.56 E:0.089915 |  thanking people for coming and giving us the support they did but I know that that's creating a bit of
[9159.92 - 9168.40] P:1412.07 E:0.082959 |  a an issue for the group um I can deal with that but I need to support the players and um the more
[9168.40 - 9172.88] P:1444.18 E:0.088256 |  the fans are as they were in the second half behind the team it's a massive lift for them because
[9172.88 - 9178.40] P:1655.51 E:0.086912 |  we're operating in a in a very very unusual environment just just finally do you sense that
[9179.12 - 9185.44] P:1465.75 E:0.080176 |  it will get better from here in the knockout stage yeah look I think we I don't think we were going
[9185.44 - 9192.32] P:1575.38 E:0.084784 |  to go from the performances we just had to a game of such pressure and score four goals it's
[9192.32 - 9199.20] P:1397.65 E:0.084802 |  football doesn't work like that so I'm pleased with the progress made uh we of course it's important
[9199.20 - 9206.56] P:1479.87 E:0.091195 |  to to win the group because you control your own destiny whether you end up with a better draw or not
[9206.56 - 9211.12] P:1409.82 E:0.080636 |  is is going to be debatable but I think you never want to look back on a tournament and say are we
[9211.12 - 9216.16] P:1401.83 E:0.082923 |  drop points and therefore we ended up going a different level of opponent and that was the
[9216.16 - 9222.00] P:1569.76 E:0.079586 |  reason that we uh we didn't succeed so um to to win the group is always important I think.
[9222.00 - 9226.64] P:1536.85 E:0.102171 |  Gareth thanks very much and well done for topping the group there we go now if he goes Gareth Southgate
[9226.64 - 9230.24] P:1479.96 E:0.099218 |  Mark right you might have been able to hear just as we were doing that interview
[9230.24 - 9235.04] P:1583.53 E:0.102219 |  Radio Slovenia we're interviewing Matjash Kek right over my right shoulder
[9235.68 - 9240.24] P:1498.72 E:0.093590 |  oh do you want to try and get Matjash Kek before we go? He's gone he's just gone
[9240.80 - 9244.88] P:1535.26 E:0.096367 |  I can't believe you missed your opportunity and I honestly do not think that there would have been
[9244.88 - 9253.28] P:1610.12 E:0.085599 |  a better chance to get him. John thank you very much Izzy Christiansen, Connor Cody still with us
[9253.28 - 9257.44] P:1634.58 E:0.079840 |  as we get ready to say goodbye from here in Cologne, Golan Street in England and Slovenia
[9258.32 - 9264.24] P:1526.92 E:0.068028 |  that was a very telling line there towards the end where he said we're operating in very
[9264.24 - 9269.20] P:1657.06 E:0.061336 |  unusual circumstances. I don't know how to interpret that if you please. No, no,
[9270.56 - 9275.76] P:1660.96 E:0.070420 |  but I think you know referring to a camp a football team whether that be club or country
[9276.48 - 9283.44] P:1746.64 E:0.069063 |  you know there's pressure and I think that nothing needs to leave that camp no information
[9283.44 - 9288.48] P:1639.09 E:0.085133 |  and I don't think anything should enter that camp any information I think what needs to happen is
[9289.36 - 9293.52] P:1823.55 E:0.083928 |  you know Gareth and his staff have got the opportunity now to bounce
[9293.52 - 9299.36] P:1745.75 E:0.075998 |  forwards in the right direction and they need to keep focused on that and not let any external noise affect them
