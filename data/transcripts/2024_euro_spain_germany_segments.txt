[0.00 - 5.36] P:1640.63 E:0.059549 |  It lives up to its expectation as referee Anthony Taylor gets us underway
[5.36 - 10.72] P:1708.04 E:0.101501 |  and Germany go downfield immediately with a ball that is headed away by Leynall Mann.
[10.72 - 13.76] P:1644.97 E:0.095596 |  They are in all white, they're playing from left to right as we look.
[13.76 - 19.36] P:1604.65 E:0.103712 |  Spain defending the end where the majority of those red shirts here in this Stuttgart arena,
[19.36 - 21.12] P:1688.83 E:0.104315 |  it holds 54,000.
[22.64 - 28.00] P:1649.31 E:0.108197 |  The top tier is suspended underneath the canopy style roof, it's actually made of fabric.
[28.72 - 34.88] P:1441.44 E:0.104304 |  We've been sitting here and it is quite an oppressive heat in this arena in Stuttgart
[34.88 - 38.40] P:1621.79 E:0.103897 |  as Marata tries to link up with Williams coming in off this left touch line
[39.04 - 42.16] P:1693.74 E:0.093468 |  and then there is Rudiger to Kimmich.
[42.16 - 47.28] P:1758.52 E:0.103596 |  The top scorers in the competition are Germany with 10, it's a joint national record.
[48.48 - 53.12] P:1800.73 E:0.100744 |  But Spain have been so dynamic as Williams plays a low ball in.
[53.12 - 57.04] P:1820.46 E:0.106693 |  Marata pulls it back, Petri with a shot left but it straight annoy it.
[57.68 - 60.88] P:1742.09 E:0.113374 |  A couple of touches already by Marata have been absolutely fantastic.
[60.88 - 64.40] P:1809.84 E:0.100827 |  They've come up to him, he's not able to hold it, he's touched it so good
[64.40 - 68.64] P:1632.54 E:0.104598 |  he's laid it back into his midfield and he's got three players running on there
[68.64 - 72.32] P:1672.98 E:0.109395 |  in the light of Nicaragua and Jamal and Petri that are going to go and hit anything.
[72.32 - 77.04] P:1782.19 E:0.111494 |  Just a moment before that it's what the interest is to see, there's something major going on off the field,
[77.04 - 82.96] P:1874.27 E:0.107859 |  off the ball between Sani and Cucarrea and it happened in the first seconds.
[82.96 - 87.20] P:1872.91 E:0.113116 |  There have already been three coming together between those two players.
[87.20 - 91.36] P:1797.04 E:0.104362 |  We've only been playing a minute, tell you what, this should be interesting.
[91.36 - 94.56] P:1784.12 E:0.088843 |  We'll see a little bit of a look at this again.
[94.56 - 99.92] P:1680.53 E:0.098502 |  First of all, I also was adived by Chan, which the referee told me he got for
[100.88 - 103.12] P:1824.36 E:0.116806 |  and in actual fact Cucarrea stayed down.
[103.76 - 110.16] P:1930.88 E:0.115277 |  And to be honest, not for the first time in this tournament, I have no idea why Cucarrea stayed down.
[110.80 - 114.88] P:1798.53 E:0.101807 |  But Cucarrea went down holding his face, his face wasn't even touched.
[114.88 - 118.56] P:1682.34 E:0.092219 |  No idea, to be honest, when unique all out players when they're doing that,
[118.56 - 121.92] P:1632.52 E:0.103885 |  throwing themselves to the ground in the next tournament, he's went to the ground so easily,
[121.92 - 126.16] P:1631.53 E:0.100590 |  that Chan dived, full stop, he dived. Cucarrea went over top,
[126.16 - 130.88] P:1589.80 E:0.100879 |  pretended to be poleaxing the face, not touched, keeping an eye on him.
[130.88 - 134.40] P:1612.38 E:0.100664 |  Him against Sani there, I think that'll be tasty.
[134.40 - 138.88] P:1640.80 E:0.102037 |  That was a warning shot though by Spain, that Petri effort was timed at 56 seconds.
[138.88 - 143.04] P:1649.13 E:0.112966 |  Yeah, the way it played up to Murata is really suited to this style.
[143.04 - 146.00] P:1732.44 E:0.108745 |  When it played in the English game, a lot of bulls played up in the air too.
[146.00 - 149.68] P:1826.15 E:0.107943 |  Now he's good at attacking bulls from crosses, but bulls is played up in the air.
[149.68 - 154.48] P:1889.29 E:0.112041 |  I mean, Tar and Rudegard are going to give them a tough time, but to feet is technically superb.
[155.20 - 158.80] P:1663.16 E:0.110619 |  Ball from Fabian goes out of play, too far ahead of Cucarrea.
[158.80 - 162.40] P:1655.66 E:0.101723 |  What a bumper weekend we have for you on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[162.40 - 165.92] P:1654.40 E:0.091968 |  The Euros, all four of the quarterfinals, Wimbledon,
[165.92 - 169.68] P:1699.23 E:0.103627 |  the Rugby Union Test match tomorrow morning, New Zealand against England,
[169.68 - 175.36] P:1579.45 E:0.109383 |  kick off at five past eight, the British Grand Prix, all on five live and BBC sounds.
[175.36 - 180.32] P:1679.37 E:0.107445 |  As Gunduan tries to touch the ball into the path of Sani on this right-hand side,
[180.32 - 184.00] P:1737.90 E:0.115266 |  Le Normand turns and puts it out of play for a German throw.
[184.00 - 186.48] P:1675.89 E:0.108303 |  Niel Niel in the early stages, three minutes played.
[187.36 - 192.32] P:1645.05 E:0.108595 |  Sun shining and those Spanish supporters away towards our right are having to shield the Sun
[192.32 - 195.20] P:1584.22 E:0.110815 |  from their eyes behind the goal of Oona Simon.
[196.00 - 199.44] P:1590.44 E:0.107591 |  As Kymik with a throw to Sani down the line, back towards Kymik.
[199.44 - 202.64] P:1707.29 E:0.101979 |  Sani tries to take it, shrugs off the challenge of Cucarrea.
[202.64 - 206.40] P:1834.06 E:0.110725 |  Rodgerie, oh, gross, taking out Pedri.
[206.40 - 209.36] P:1852.44 E:0.108613 |  Anthony Taylor comes under pressure from both sets of players.
[209.36 - 212.40] P:1859.55 E:0.107684 |  He tells them to move away, but Pedri was caught.
[212.40 - 213.84] P:1898.22 E:0.094441 |  You'd be stunned.
[213.84 - 217.28] P:1691.71 E:0.108509 |  I don't think he's going to bring his yellow card out there, and I'm amazed by that,
[217.28 - 221.60] P:1719.79 E:0.105366 |  because he completely mis-times it and he wipes it away completely.
[221.60 - 225.04] P:1758.11 E:0.110993 |  That is the clearest yellow card you're going to see.
[226.24 - 227.84] P:1822.49 E:0.130755 |  He's really wiped them out there.
[229.04 - 231.12] P:1951.42 E:0.124649 |  I mean, he's down and he's not acting.
[231.12 - 233.12] P:1945.45 E:0.124815 |  He's been taken out, a really bad one.
[233.12 - 235.04] P:1961.65 E:0.117763 |  Might have a dead leg just above his knee.
[235.76 - 239.36] P:1967.87 E:0.122216 |  And Anthony Taylor, and he's not reached with his yellow card yet,
[239.36 - 242.80] P:1837.55 E:0.108651 |  and you just wonder sometimes with the home crowd, the biggest name,
[243.36 - 248.00] P:1773.72 E:0.093137 |  is there something in that because anyone else, they've reached the card out, don't they?
[248.00 - 252.48] P:1779.05 E:0.098542 |  Well, Luis Stella Fuente, the 63-year-old head coach of Spain,
[252.48 - 257.44] P:1718.78 E:0.096158 |  is having to be appeased by Ivan Krusliak, the Slovakian who's the fourth official.
[257.44 - 258.64] P:1671.75 E:0.102106 |  Now, he takes no nonsense.
[258.64 - 261.60] P:1625.57 E:0.102402 |  You might recall he took charge of an Aston Villa tie in Europe.
[261.60 - 262.88] P:1569.66 E:0.101737 |  I think he was at Lille.
[262.88 - 267.28] P:1804.92 E:0.106754 |  And all the Spanish substitutes are saying that the gesturing wears the card.
[267.84 - 271.12] P:1816.09 E:0.104646 |  And Krusliak has told them to sit down and be quiet.
[271.12 - 274.72] P:1776.26 E:0.099281 |  Pedri will certainly have a dead leg, because he was taken out.
[275.60 - 277.52] P:1686.16 E:0.119604 |  Really high. And it was so high.
[278.80 - 281.12] P:1507.31 E:0.109948 |  It's quite... I'm not suggesting it was deliberate.
[281.12 - 283.20] P:1629.84 E:0.103389 |  I actually don't think it was, particularly if there ever...
[283.20 - 284.24] P:1513.51 E:0.112117 |  But it was dangerous.
[284.24 - 287.84] P:1577.48 E:0.107297 |  And he left his leg kind of hanging there, and it just wiped him out.
[287.84 - 290.80] P:1620.89 E:0.102975 |  So, you know, the referee's got a decision to make now.
[290.80 - 292.56] P:1508.90 E:0.107548 |  What if there's another one just the same as that?
[293.28 - 294.32] P:1673.27 E:0.122165 |  Is he going to let that go?
[294.96 - 296.80] P:1935.85 E:0.116183 |  No action taken by Anthony Taylor.
[296.80 - 298.40] P:1823.39 E:0.111913 |  Pedri is back on the field of play.
[298.40 - 301.28] P:1802.44 E:0.106729 |  You're listening to five live, five minutes play.
[301.36 - 305.28] P:1659.08 E:0.098908 |  Rodgery clips the ball on up towards Williams, near side the left.
[305.28 - 308.56] P:1631.76 E:0.106241 |  Takes it on the inside of Kimmich, rolls it towards Rodgery.
[308.56 - 309.60] P:1762.78 E:0.114910 |  He was fouled.
[309.60 - 313.36] P:1814.69 E:0.120292 |  And on this occasion, referee Anthony Taylor blows his whistle,
[313.36 - 314.56] P:1902.23 E:0.116977 |  gives Spain the free kick.
[314.56 - 317.52] P:1919.73 E:0.102864 |  You can hear what the German supporters think about that decision.
[317.52 - 319.52] P:1757.37 E:0.097220 |  And now it's taken quickly by Spain.
[319.52 - 322.56] P:1745.68 E:0.098775 |  Out to La Mena, Mal, this exciting teenager.
[322.56 - 325.20] P:1731.97 E:0.105688 |  Skips inside one challenge, passes the ball in field.
[325.20 - 326.80] P:1696.64 E:0.109884 |  He's gone down, saying he was fouled.
[327.44 - 329.84] P:1801.77 E:0.115054 |  There's a little bit of niggle already creeping into this game.
[329.84 - 330.64] P:1859.45 E:0.101910 |  Six minutes in.
[330.64 - 333.60] P:1792.04 E:0.107843 |  It's a very hard game to referee because it's so tight,
[333.60 - 336.56] P:1791.96 E:0.102129 |  because players have been pressed all over the field.
[336.56 - 338.00] P:1795.53 E:0.115557 |  And there's a lot of tackles going in.
[338.64 - 341.60] P:1854.50 E:0.126953 |  And another player down holding his face this time.
[341.60 - 342.08] P:1908.48 E:0.111011 |  Petri.
[342.96 - 344.56] P:1951.99 E:0.118402 |  Petri can't continue.
[344.56 - 347.60] P:1937.41 E:0.121144 |  And you have a look at the Spanish Benz.
[347.60 - 348.96] P:1951.81 E:0.118211 |  They're absolutely fuming at this.
[350.88 - 354.00] P:1846.20 E:0.118562 |  And to be fair, it may have looked really, really rough.
[354.00 - 358.32] P:1728.59 E:0.101776 |  I'm totally stunned that that initial one wasn't a yellow card.
[358.32 - 361.92] P:1704.59 E:0.103046 |  He's tried to run it off here, but I'm trying to see if he's actually got anything else.
[361.92 - 366.56] P:1759.12 E:0.096121 |  He's hit, but I tell you what, that's Jamal being done there.
[366.56 - 369.12] P:1750.99 E:0.104280 |  He says he's first to do it again.
[369.12 - 375.04] P:1868.83 E:0.118337 |  Not saying it's deliberate, but you know, there's referees that get the cards out for that as well.
[375.04 - 377.76] P:1980.16 E:0.112630 |  So Petri's done it again.
[377.76 - 380.08] P:1804.45 E:0.110677 |  Danny Olmo's going to be coming on.
[380.08 - 382.64] P:1821.07 E:0.098707 |  There was a lot of speculation leading up to this game
[382.64 - 384.48] P:1707.19 E:0.100451 |  that he should have replaced Petri.
[384.48 - 385.68] P:1702.29 E:0.105929 |  He retained his place.
[385.68 - 390.40] P:1631.55 E:0.083617 |  He stood the youngster from Barcelona,
[390.40 - 396.64] P:1610.12 E:0.089345 |  but he's the victim of a heavy challenge by Tony Crows.
[396.64 - 400.08] P:1538.93 E:0.107600 |  He's tried to shrug it off, and then he's gone down and he's sitting down,
[400.08 - 402.08] P:1602.35 E:0.108311 |  and he's going to have to come off the field of play.
[402.08 - 406.64] P:1714.12 E:0.116157 |  Yeah, it's a typical one, and every referee will deny this completely.
[406.64 - 409.60] P:1694.67 E:0.114593 |  But you can't come out with a game plan if you're at it as well.
[409.60 - 411.60] P:1483.12 E:0.118144 |  You don't want to get a yellow card early on.
[411.60 - 413.04] P:1540.57 E:0.111494 |  You want to calm the game down a little.
[413.12 - 416.32] P:1847.39 E:0.099048 |  You also want to let it flow a little bit.
[416.32 - 418.32] P:1579.72 E:0.121902 |  But sometimes you need to make a decision now,
[418.32 - 420.72] P:1541.27 E:0.098533 |  and I'm just not convinced he got that one right.
[420.72 - 422.00] P:1429.36 E:0.118311 |  And the players are now angry.
[422.00 - 422.80] P:1494.28 E:0.094639 |  They're going to love it.
[422.80 - 424.32] P:1778.61 E:0.092384 |  Catch you about it as well.
[424.32 - 426.64] P:1825.62 E:0.096196 |  Maybe I'll have lost a player off the field.
[426.64 - 430.48] P:1904.43 E:0.110895 |  And I do have a suspicion that maybe if it wasn't Tony Crows,
[430.48 - 432.40] P:1893.68 E:0.106389 |  if there had been somebody else,
[432.40 - 435.12] P:1904.37 E:0.104499 |  the temptation would have forgotten the yellow card out.
[435.12 - 439.04] P:1814.49 E:0.100337 |  Well, Petri is on his feet, but he's hobbling badly,
[439.04 - 442.24] P:1771.86 E:0.097797 |  and seven minutes into this contest here in Stuttgart,
[442.24 - 443.76] P:1752.83 E:0.112443 |  he is going to be replaced.
[444.48 - 449.20] P:1720.24 E:0.104350 |  The family and friends of each of the sides competing in this tournament
[449.20 - 451.04] P:1623.10 E:0.106982 |  tend to sit just behind the dugouts,
[451.60 - 456.24] P:1691.82 E:0.098565 |  and that small pocket of red down beneath us here behind the Spanish bench
[456.24 - 460.24] P:1631.85 E:0.097802 |  are all rising to their feet and giving Petri a standing ovation.
[460.24 - 463.04] P:1741.15 E:0.091681 |  As he does struggle, at least he can walk,
[463.04 - 464.56] P:1641.78 E:0.102567 |  but he's hobbling quite badly.
[464.56 - 466.64] P:1614.94 E:0.096814 |  He's embraced now by Dani Olmo,
[466.64 - 470.24] P:1821.28 E:0.093311 |  who of course plays his football in Germany for Leipzig.
[470.24 - 472.24] P:1856.74 E:0.108149 |  They finished fourth in the Bundesliga this year,
[472.88 - 475.44] P:1714.12 E:0.103982 |  and Dani Olmo comes on to replace Petri,
[475.44 - 478.72] P:1736.01 E:0.105870 |  but Petri is now being consoled by his substitutes,
[478.72 - 480.64] P:1799.47 E:0.098187 |  his teammates in the green bibs,
[480.64 - 482.56] P:1594.62 E:0.103944 |  as he makes his way back onto the bench.
[484.08 - 487.60] P:1797.57 E:0.101086 |  So, Germany give the ball back to Spain,
[487.60 - 492.00] P:1749.85 E:0.089653 |  sportingly, Chan chips it long, downfield to Unai Simon,
[492.00 - 495.04] P:1791.97 E:0.099947 |  and after that lengthy stoppage here in the sunshine in Stuttgart,
[495.04 - 498.32] P:1552.97 E:0.091646 |  five live and BBC sounds, we're back underway at 0-0.
[498.40 - 500.00] P:1609.53 E:0.110353 |  It's been a better stop-start, obviously,
[501.04 - 502.88] P:1679.20 E:0.111833 |  but what I was wanting to see at the start of the game
[502.88 - 506.08] P:1581.80 E:0.108177 |  is whether the Germans would be as offensive,
[506.08 - 507.28] P:1465.61 E:0.112442 |  or would they sit off slightly,
[507.28 - 509.04] P:1557.78 E:0.112533 |  because you know the Spanish are not going to do that.
[509.68 - 510.48] P:1413.73 E:0.113738 |  The Germans are.
[510.48 - 514.08] P:1731.97 E:0.100923 |  They're trying to stand up to them, punch for punch,
[514.08 - 516.00] P:1545.27 E:0.104732 |  and they don't, I mean, they're physically violent,
[516.00 - 519.36] P:1622.16 E:0.096508 |  I mean, they want to attack as much as they can as well,
[519.36 - 521.36] P:1601.46 E:0.101236 |  but let's hope there's a little bit more flow to the game there,
[521.36 - 523.52] P:1712.68 E:0.096326 |  unless three kicks than there's been so far.
[524.08 - 528.08] P:1700.34 E:0.099446 |  Certainly a stop-start nature to the proceedings here in Stuttgart,
[528.48 - 529.04] P:1583.59 E:0.111205 |  Rudiger.
[529.60 - 531.44] P:1560.67 E:0.111714 |  When you see Spain in the flesh,
[531.44 - 534.56] P:1623.46 E:0.092610 |  the one thing that has really struck me
[534.56 - 536.24] P:1533.06 E:0.107871 |  is their work rate off the ball.
[536.80 - 537.76] P:1690.19 E:0.107830 |  Here is Williams.
[538.56 - 541.92] P:1752.87 E:0.114582 |  A couple of occasions the other day against Georgia in Cologne,
[541.92 - 544.40] P:1782.61 E:0.095588 |  they had four red shirts snuffing out,
[544.40 - 546.64] P:1681.33 E:0.088852 |  potential Georgian counter-attacks,
[547.44 - 550.08] P:1500.56 E:0.094356 |  and Germany being pressed by Fabian,
[550.08 - 553.68] P:1596.68 E:0.090576 |  Rudiger to Kimmich with Williams putting him under pressure,
[553.68 - 556.00] P:1560.86 E:0.103041 |  cleared long by Rudiger, up towards Sane,
[556.08 - 557.04] P:1462.40 E:0.094710 |  bounces in field,
[558.08 - 560.08] P:1621.38 E:0.107740 |  Yamal clips it first time,
[560.08 - 561.20] P:1753.15 E:0.097701 |  Marata will give chase,
[561.76 - 563.20] P:1577.92 E:0.107111 |  and that ball is going to go out of play,
[563.20 - 565.68] P:1819.96 E:0.096297 |  and it will be a Spain throw on this near side,
[565.68 - 568.32] P:1843.49 E:0.099055 |  in front of their balled headed coach, De La Fuente.
[568.32 - 571.04] P:1850.73 E:0.104708 |  Very, very smart, suave and sophisticated,
[571.76 - 575.36] P:1770.58 E:0.087360 |  with his crew-neck T-shirt and his suit jacket.
[575.36 - 578.08] P:1651.67 E:0.093349 |  Of course, he's wearing the customary black and white pumps
[578.08 - 580.08] P:1775.44 E:0.101611 |  as the referee, Anthony Taylor,
[580.08 - 582.80] P:1683.72 E:0.104329 |  will say this will be a free kick to Germany.
[582.80 - 585.04] P:1671.04 E:0.110371 |  It was an offside, yeah, it was an offside just before that,
[585.04 - 586.08] P:1587.80 E:0.091430 |  and the bell's up.
[586.08 - 589.76] P:1681.54 E:0.105958 |  But it's funny that because it did start very, very quickly,
[589.76 - 591.44] P:1457.71 E:0.111685 |  but because of those negligible fills,
[592.24 - 596.24] P:1758.89 E:0.108096 |  and purely because each player was closing everybody else down very quietly,
[596.88 - 599.52] P:1736.47 E:0.105780 |  it's kind of not gotten to his rhythm yet,
[599.52 - 602.40] P:1597.03 E:0.102129 |  but you can see the Spanish, yeah, so high up the field,
[602.40 - 603.84] P:1498.39 E:0.112605 |  they really want to press on them.
[604.72 - 606.48] P:1621.18 E:0.095474 |  Ball played out by Tart,
[606.48 - 608.96] P:1610.08 E:0.107539 |  Mussialla on the stretch, couldn't get there on the halfway line,
[608.96 - 610.40] P:1715.95 E:0.096854 |  picked up by Gunduan,
[610.40 - 611.84] P:1772.90 E:0.117151 |  he's got a round going on ahead of him,
[611.84 - 614.00] P:1817.84 E:0.112416 |  Dagelborn in field will reach Haberts,
[614.08 - 616.56] P:1763.79 E:0.105932 |  Sane in back takes over, there is Haberts,
[616.56 - 620.56] P:1725.57 E:0.110642 |  plays it back out towards Rahm, Rahm drives it left from that left footed,
[620.56 - 622.48] P:1879.27 E:0.113934 |  and into the arms of Una Simon,
[622.48 - 624.88] P:1803.96 E:0.115591 |  who bolted out straight away towards Williams,
[624.88 - 627.36] P:1754.93 E:0.112062 |  Ruder Gido stepped out of defence and had it covered,
[627.36 - 630.08] P:1795.26 E:0.113072 |  and all of a sudden, Germany now being urged on.
[630.08 - 632.00] P:1813.45 E:0.114281 |  They're inside the Spanish half,
[632.00 - 635.44] P:1780.01 E:0.105342 |  but that ball out towards Rahm was unable to be controlled,
[635.44 - 637.84] P:1654.64 E:0.104901 |  and it's gone out of play for a throw, Nil Nil Patnevin.
[637.84 - 640.80] P:1534.60 E:0.114094 |  Nico Wownes has been brilliant in this tournament so far on the left wing,
[640.80 - 642.16] P:1729.17 E:0.087599 |  for the Spanish,
[642.16 - 644.08] P:1659.95 E:0.119052 |  but he's got to keep a shot there,
[644.08 - 646.72] P:1600.37 E:0.102664 |  gave him a 50-50 with Tony Rudiger,
[646.72 - 648.80] P:1627.71 E:0.107983 |  and nobody wants that, generally,
[648.80 - 650.88] P:1683.86 E:0.106818 |  but you don't want an early in a game anyway.
[650.88 - 652.16] P:1461.67 E:0.112652 |  So Rudiger won the ball there,
[652.16 - 654.00] P:1668.79 E:0.088312 |  but both teams wanted close to him,
[654.00 - 656.64] P:1527.88 E:0.095197 |  there was a moment just before there, Haberts was on the tongue,
[656.64 - 658.96] P:1525.27 E:0.101338 |  and that little tunnel they had the other night,
[658.96 - 661.36] P:1610.84 E:0.100782 |  which was one of the best I've seen in the tournament so far,
[661.36 - 664.24] P:1588.58 E:0.101799 |  he tried that one again, didn't quite come off the same way.
[664.24 - 666.64] P:1676.68 E:0.110860 |  There is Williams for Spain on this near side of the left,
[666.64 - 669.12] P:1440.76 E:0.104119 |  Cucarera just over the halfway line,
[669.20 - 672.08] P:1614.66 E:0.104002 |  La Porte, Fabian, plays it first time,
[672.08 - 676.80] P:1544.67 E:0.106201 |  Cucarera back in field now to the midfielder from Paris Saint-Germain,
[676.80 - 680.40] P:1682.33 E:0.104375 |  Charme will go towards him, just strokes it back to Le Normand,
[681.20 - 684.32] P:1572.50 E:0.101801 |  Carvajal is out wide over on that far side,
[684.32 - 686.96] P:1683.64 E:0.097484 |  Carvajal patiently playing it across the back,
[686.96 - 690.80] P:1723.62 E:0.081409 |  our Spain here in Stuttgart, five-live,
[690.80 - 694.72] P:1740.14 E:0.092830 |  still goalless between the two, as Le Normand,
[695.84 - 698.80] P:1851.93 E:0.113702 |  edging his way slowly but surely towards the halfway line.
[699.20 - 702.16] P:1935.52 E:0.099564 |  The Wimbledon coverage continues on Sports Extra,
[702.16 - 706.72] P:1829.39 E:0.102046 |  as here is Fabian to Williams, Cucarera coming forward on the near side,
[706.72 - 710.88] P:1793.87 E:0.101757 |  Williams goes it alone, right footed, and dragged it well off target,
[710.88 - 712.40] P:1672.89 E:0.107313 |  and that will be a goal kick, Neil Mill.
[712.40 - 714.88] P:1798.28 E:0.100228 |  There are some players that are just that much more special
[714.88 - 720.00] P:1651.37 E:0.101428 |  when they see them in the flesh, and Fabian's vision is absolutely fantastic,
[720.56 - 723.84] P:1744.57 E:0.123609 |  I mean, he's getting close to some of those greats in the last 10, 20 years ago,
[724.40 - 727.12] P:1887.37 E:0.123472 |  and there's another stoppage in play here, isn't it?
[727.12 - 729.44] P:1895.07 E:0.109913 |  You're absolutely right, it's getting a bit niggly.
[730.00 - 732.40] P:1742.35 E:0.114144 |  Is that Nico Williams having a little bit with Kimmich?
[732.40 - 732.64] P:1890.26 E:0.078960 |  Yep.
[734.32 - 736.48] P:1562.67 E:0.114622 |  It's happening off the ball, so it's hard to see,
[737.92 - 742.40] P:1679.79 E:0.099626 |  and he's just left his body there, where Kimmich is kind of kicked through it.
[743.28 - 745.12] P:1581.08 E:0.105319 |  Yeah, it's a foul, isn't it, vicious?
[745.12 - 746.48] P:1371.02 E:0.114361 |  There's nothing really to buy a bit.
[747.68 - 750.88] P:1687.54 E:0.117818 |  But can I sort of show that earlier on, a lot about physicality,
[750.88 - 754.16] P:1760.69 E:0.109219 |  letting each other know that they are very old-skilling, anyways.
[755.12 - 757.92] P:1646.33 E:0.103703 |  Again, no take, action taken from Anthony Taylor.
[758.80 - 762.32] P:1611.55 E:0.104334 |  Later on tonight, we've got the next quarterfinal for you live from Hamburg,
[762.32 - 763.52] P:1733.66 E:0.090176 |  Portugal against France.
[764.16 - 767.28] P:1679.99 E:0.105507 |  There's Gunduan, he's caught in possession by La Mignamal,
[767.28 - 769.84] P:1710.84 E:0.101124 |  his Barcelona teammate, Marata, placing inside,
[769.84 - 772.56] P:1679.59 E:0.110271 |  Olmo trying to get through, Olmo taken out by Rüdiger.
[773.76 - 775.76] P:1817.66 E:0.120749 |  Rüdiger's on a yellow card, incidentally.
[775.76 - 778.72] P:1898.78 E:0.105236 |  If he gets shown here, he will miss the semi-final,
[778.72 - 780.96] P:1912.17 E:0.098892 |  should Germany progress, and indeed,
[780.96 - 785.28] P:1819.59 E:0.108203 |  the Real Madrid defender will be ruled out of any last four appearance.
[786.00 - 789.60] P:1873.86 E:0.106405 |  Show the yellow, the first yellow card of the game by Anthony Taylor,
[789.60 - 792.00] P:1843.29 E:0.103332 |  Rüdiger suspended for the semi-final.
[792.00 - 793.84] P:1607.32 E:0.105228 |  Well, that's a big, big moment for Germany.
[793.84 - 796.80] P:1749.01 E:0.109736 |  Can you hear the sound of a marmer around the stadium?
[796.80 - 799.12] P:1822.63 E:0.103113 |  Either worried about the free kick he's given away,
[799.12 - 801.76] P:1802.04 E:0.105656 |  which is only 20 yards out, very dangerous position,
[801.76 - 805.76] P:1686.19 E:0.104757 |  but everyone in here knows that Rüdiger's going to miss the next game if they get through.
[805.76 - 810.72] P:1826.10 E:0.103253 |  And how similar was it to the tackle that Tony Cross wasn't booked for?
[810.96 - 813.92] P:1866.01 E:0.096187 |  As I said, some people get booked for some chavicles,
[813.92 - 816.08] P:1611.95 E:0.112189 |  and the same tackle, someone has got to leave with it.
[816.72 - 820.72] P:1749.66 E:0.106314 |  The imposing, aggressive central defender of Anthony Rüdiger
[821.36 - 823.60] P:1617.15 E:0.093486 |  will be missing the semi-final.
[823.60 - 828.56] P:1850.51 E:0.102106 |  Now, this is a free kick for Spain, direct free kick, right of the deep.
[829.60 - 837.12] P:1883.20 E:0.106674 |  Is it Olmo off the right foot or the left foot of La Mignamal?
[837.68 - 840.56] P:1853.91 E:0.108348 |  The youngest ever player in the history of the European Championship.
[840.56 - 843.28] P:1963.32 E:0.109128 |  Germany have got every white shirt back inside the penalty area.
[843.28 - 848.08] P:1887.30 E:0.107068 |  It's Olmo, he leaves it for Yamal, strikes it, takes the deflection of Target,
[848.08 - 850.24] P:1639.07 E:0.104458 |  and it will go out for a goal, kick, nil, nil.
[850.24 - 852.96] P:1704.28 E:0.119631 |  He's went below the wall, expecting a jump.
[852.96 - 857.84] P:1745.12 E:0.092987 |  They haven't got the player below the wall, so he's waiting for them to jump.
[857.84 - 861.20] P:1575.30 E:0.109585 |  They do jump, but he doesn't quite get it on Target.
[861.20 - 864.80] P:1766.02 E:0.095285 |  He's not lacking in confidence for a 16-year-old, is he?
[864.80 - 865.52] P:1768.40 E:0.102901 |  No.
[865.76 - 866.96] P:1651.35 E:0.081401 |  Pretty impressive.
[866.96 - 869.20] P:1736.51 E:0.100035 |  He's actually started beautifully in this game.
[869.20 - 872.16] P:1651.32 E:0.101834 |  He glides past players so fabulously.
[873.20 - 881.52] P:1696.53 E:0.102907 |  He's 16 years and 358 days old, as Gundue makes ground on that far side to left.
[881.52 - 883.20] P:1754.39 E:0.099922 |  Havertz and Sane are up with him.
[883.20 - 887.28] P:1690.59 E:0.105050 |  He finds Sane, central position outside the D, touches the ball to Kroos.
[887.28 - 888.88] P:1745.71 E:0.113573 |  He was caught late from behind.
[888.88 - 890.64] P:1771.31 E:0.113362 |  Williams brings the ball away.
[890.64 - 893.20] P:1801.67 E:0.112542 |  Germany protest, Spanish counterattack.
[893.28 - 894.96] P:1885.82 E:0.095325 |  Spanish counterattack.
[894.96 - 896.80] P:1784.41 E:0.110307 |  Yamal over the halfway line.
[896.80 - 898.00] P:1809.77 E:0.107440 |  Olmo, Morato's pit.
[898.00 - 900.08] P:1765.31 E:0.100947 |  Morato's peeled out to this left-hand side.
[900.08 - 901.92] P:1745.40 E:0.104669 |  Thought Olmo would overrun that ball.
[901.92 - 903.92] P:1751.86 E:0.104126 |  He just finds Morato, Morato shoots.
[903.92 - 905.44] P:1709.30 E:0.114811 |  That's charged down by Chan.
[906.08 - 908.72] P:1696.34 E:0.112693 |  And then it rebounds up towards the halfway line.
[908.72 - 912.80] P:1687.04 E:0.092115 |  Le Porte with a flick with his leg, headed on by Rodgery.
[912.80 - 916.72] P:1779.75 E:0.104776 |  15 minutes played, still nil-nil, live on five live ambivisie sounds.
[916.72 - 920.08] P:1766.25 E:0.105705 |  But the most notable dash limits between the teams is,
[920.08 - 923.44] P:1643.45 E:0.095945 |  when the Spanish players run with the ball, the Germans can't get near them.
[923.44 - 925.28] P:1810.66 E:0.108484 |  They're just flying by them.
[925.28 - 927.20] P:1759.97 E:0.111291 |  So you've seen these tackles going flying.
[927.20 - 931.04] P:1679.77 E:0.104535 |  As I see it, Ramm tries to get into Yamal there.
[931.04 - 933.04] P:1700.91 E:0.121275 |  And they're doing everything to stop him now.
[933.04 - 936.32] P:1753.33 E:0.109377 |  They are very, very worried about the dribbling from the Spanish.
[936.32 - 940.24] P:1699.52 E:0.108218 |  Havertz, Mussiola, who's been quiet, collects the ball,
[940.24 - 942.80] P:1668.82 E:0.102180 |  goes out to the left touch line, midway through the Spain half.
[943.36 - 944.32] P:1608.27 E:0.127514 |  Ramm on the overlap.
[944.32 - 946.88] P:1738.26 E:0.096545 |  He finds him left-hand side, looks for the cutback.
[946.88 - 950.72] P:1820.04 E:0.112554 |  And with a couple of deflections, it's scooped up inside his six-yard area
[950.72 - 953.68] P:1805.97 E:0.106163 |  by Unoi Simon, 16 minutes played, nil-nil.
[954.32 - 957.12] P:1711.48 E:0.110790 |  Juno's always really good when you see Wenger's playing.
[957.12 - 960.88] P:1621.55 E:0.108870 |  I would say that, but Zane, Mussiola, Nico Williams,
[960.88 - 962.32] P:1683.99 E:0.102485 |  who's looked really lively.
[962.32 - 965.76] P:1724.19 E:0.106196 |  And Yamal as well, who's probably been the pick of them so far in this game.
[966.48 - 968.64] P:1566.91 E:0.111376 |  Here is Yamal on that right-hand side.
[968.64 - 971.84] P:1724.33 E:0.106128 |  Fabian finds some space, looks for a shooting opportunity.
[971.84 - 975.04] P:1790.82 E:0.107307 |  Left footed, couldn't keep it down, just outside the D off target.
[976.00 - 978.08] P:1747.36 E:0.102437 |  I don't think he should shoot there.
[978.08 - 981.20] P:1759.01 E:0.107701 |  I know he's 20 yards out, and he's actually scored in the tournament so far.
[981.20 - 983.60] P:1613.10 E:0.109385 |  But there is an overlap outside him to his left.
[983.60 - 985.76] P:1656.29 E:0.089067 |  Morata's looking at him to say,
[985.76 - 988.32] P:1677.01 E:0.106775 |  oh, just passed him in, it's 2-1, 2-1.
[988.32 - 992.32] P:1662.91 E:0.106410 |  If Nico Williams widens me here, we'll be through in the goalkeeper.
[992.32 - 995.92] P:1641.51 E:0.115015 |  But he got a little bit carried away there, Fabian, and put it over the crossbar.
[997.04 - 998.96] P:1754.81 E:0.117088 |  So if you were to judge this game in quarters,
[998.96 - 1001.44] P:1681.67 E:0.103123 |  who'd been playing for 16 and a half minutes,
[1001.44 - 1002.96] P:1655.94 E:0.113544 |  you'd give the first quarter the space.
[1002.96 - 1003.76] P:1613.67 E:0.115972 |  So far, yeah.
[1005.04 - 1007.12] P:1649.36 E:0.113780 |  Not quite the full quarter of the game gone yet,
[1007.12 - 1009.84] P:1630.10 E:0.103403 |  but Spain at the moment look the more dangerous.
[1009.84 - 1011.76] P:1753.28 E:0.109948 |  That's not to say there aren't dangers.
[1011.76 - 1013.92] P:1726.03 E:0.113995 |  And we've not seen Moussiala run at his defender yet,
[1013.92 - 1015.52] P:1597.05 E:0.092503 |  and he's up against Carvajal.
[1015.52 - 1018.80] P:1630.82 E:0.097624 |  He's got a few years in him, you know, he's got the pace of him.
[1018.80 - 1022.24] P:1604.57 E:0.092954 |  But many players have the pace of Carvajal, and don't get much out of him.
[1022.80 - 1023.76] P:1550.72 E:0.112450 |  Here is Rudiger.
[1023.76 - 1026.88] P:1676.59 E:0.101419 |  He wants Kimmich to go a little bit further forward on this near side, the right.
[1027.44 - 1031.12] P:1694.13 E:0.095647 |  Kimmich midway through the Spain half, all in white, remember Germany.
[1031.20 - 1034.08] P:1639.79 E:0.111498 |  Now in field to Chan, former Liverpool midfielder.
[1034.64 - 1036.80] P:1695.69 E:0.109933 |  Gunduan is just ahead of him.
[1036.80 - 1040.56] P:1742.48 E:0.109554 |  Back to Kroos, in between the two central defenders.
[1040.56 - 1042.16] P:1780.29 E:0.106573 |  Havertz comes deep.
[1042.16 - 1045.36] P:1672.49 E:0.110957 |  In the shadows of the main stand here in the Stuttgart Arena.
[1045.36 - 1051.12] P:1704.07 E:0.107671 |  As the German support created a bit noise inside this 54,000 capacity arena.
[1051.76 - 1054.24] P:1755.49 E:0.099185 |  Kroos waits, Rudiger is to the side of him.
[1054.24 - 1056.40] P:1592.65 E:0.107233 |  Spain have got everybody back inside their own half.
[1056.96 - 1059.12] P:1637.60 E:0.093000 |  Marata tries to close down Kroos.
[1059.12 - 1060.16] P:1580.37 E:0.102912 |  To Jonathan Tahr.
[1060.16 - 1062.80] P:1667.31 E:0.097957 |  Kroos now takes over with the outside of his right boot,
[1062.80 - 1064.64] P:1745.74 E:0.102174 |  spreads it out towards the left background.
[1065.44 - 1067.84] P:1792.89 E:0.083596 |  Got a couple of touches to take it forward.
[1067.84 - 1070.16] P:1620.88 E:0.105511 |  Into the sunshine now he is with Mussiala.
[1072.00 - 1074.64] P:1524.09 E:0.101465 |  Mussiala on that left touch line, back towards Gunduan.
[1074.64 - 1076.56] P:1643.45 E:0.103500 |  Nice, gentle pace though by Germany.
[1077.68 - 1079.28] P:1674.79 E:0.105777 |  Kroos looking to dictate.
[1081.28 - 1081.60] P:1652.43 E:0.155791 |  Tahr.
[1082.80 - 1084.08] P:1755.98 E:0.100295 |  Havertz again.
[1084.08 - 1086.32] P:1655.40 E:0.112654 |  Just dropping off the two central defenders a little bit,
[1086.32 - 1088.40] P:1780.37 E:0.104168 |  not necessarily playing on their shoulder.
[1089.36 - 1091.12] P:1766.41 E:0.100820 |  There's Kimmich to Sane.
[1091.12 - 1094.96] P:1786.42 E:0.104261 |  Low ball into the box, stretching to keep it from going behind.
[1094.96 - 1096.08] P:1821.42 E:0.094717 |  There's Laporte.
[1096.08 - 1099.12] P:1779.68 E:0.099970 |  He concedes a throw though, 10 yards up from the corner flag,
[1099.12 - 1101.20] P:1778.51 E:0.094183 |  near side the right that Kimmich will take quickly.
[1102.40 - 1104.64] P:1558.22 E:0.097965 |  Rudiger back with Jonathan Tahr.
[1104.64 - 1106.72] P:1760.49 E:0.094968 |  Sustained spell of pressure from Germany.
[1106.72 - 1108.72] P:1661.68 E:0.096050 |  Probably the first time that they've actually had that.
[1108.72 - 1110.88] P:1691.13 E:0.105825 |  Offside against Kimmich on this near side.
[1110.88 - 1114.80] P:1676.07 E:0.117481 |  And Mussial, the assistant referee gets his flag up very, very early.
[1115.36 - 1116.80] P:1502.16 E:0.116380 |  They're doing generally do that.
[1116.80 - 1119.12] P:1473.90 E:0.094628 |  He seemed very confident because the player was right beside them
[1119.12 - 1121.28] P:1585.61 E:0.092774 |  and I think he's spot on with that one.
[1121.28 - 1122.96] P:1689.13 E:0.090517 |  So I'm not going to complain about that.
[1122.96 - 1125.52] P:1596.04 E:0.096730 |  But it's as if the Germans are starting, you know,
[1125.52 - 1129.20] P:1711.88 E:0.105051 |  play really quick at the beginning and see how the Spanish can cope there.
[1129.20 - 1132.08] P:1719.53 E:0.098367 |  And it's kind of, oh actually, that's not a good idea.
[1132.08 - 1133.60] P:1644.06 E:0.104958 |  We better control this more.
[1133.60 - 1136.64] P:1670.60 E:0.112710 |  And you can see the Germans saying, no, no, let's control the game.
[1136.64 - 1141.04] P:1686.68 E:0.105530 |  Get the ball to Jan and Kroos, particularly in that central midfield there.
[1141.04 - 1142.88] P:1769.05 E:0.105035 |  And build it up slowly.
[1142.88 - 1145.76] P:1719.47 E:0.105236 |  Whereas the Spanish, they'd love to lift the tempo.
[1147.04 - 1152.32] P:1744.24 E:0.106527 |  Germany lost the first meeting to Spain on German soil back in 1935 in Cologne.
[1152.32 - 1156.16] P:1508.45 E:0.076784 |  They've been unbeaten in their last nine since.
[1157.60 - 1160.56] P:1657.68 E:0.112198 |  As this is the fourth meeting between the two at the Euros.
[1161.28 - 1165.60] P:1673.22 E:0.081271 |  Spain, who really came through a tough group.
[1165.60 - 1169.52] P:1779.95 E:0.103439 |  Group B winners navigating their way past Croatia, Italy and Albania.
[1170.88 - 1174.96] P:1724.04 E:0.111832 |  The only side, of course, with a 100% winning record in this competition.
[1175.68 - 1179.20] P:1684.20 E:0.099235 |  As Kimmich floats it forward, headed away by Le Nommand.
[1179.20 - 1183.12] P:1700.13 E:0.086253 |  Edge of the area, Rodgery trying to get away from Sane.
[1183.12 - 1186.16] P:1723.07 E:0.091193 |  Mussialas there, Cham stabs it back to Tar.
[1187.60 - 1191.60] P:1794.32 E:0.094052 |  And Ramm on that far side, back with Tar once again.
[1191.60 - 1193.28] P:1700.63 E:0.106471 |  His forward ball to Mussiala.
[1193.28 - 1196.32] P:1692.23 E:0.094796 |  Just had to accelerate away from Lameen Yamal.
[1196.32 - 1197.76] P:1809.54 E:0.104614 |  Keeps the ball though for Germany.
[1198.88 - 1201.04] P:1782.41 E:0.095437 |  And now it's with Kroos and Cham.
[1201.04 - 1202.72] P:1540.50 E:0.106700 |  There's a man over on that far side.
[1202.80 - 1205.36] P:1618.88 E:0.094632 |  It's David Ramm, but Gunduan spins.
[1205.36 - 1208.00] P:1747.34 E:0.112420 |  And Kimmich is joining the attack on this near side, the right.
[1208.00 - 1210.32] P:1774.59 E:0.101521 |  And his diagonal ball along the ground finds him.
[1210.32 - 1212.96] P:1822.91 E:0.107768 |  And Kimmich chips the ball into the penalty area.
[1212.96 - 1215.68] P:1716.60 E:0.111117 |  And Hamerts with a header saved by Ulo Simo.
[1216.32 - 1218.32] P:1741.01 E:0.125764 |  I mean, he got up really well there.
[1218.32 - 1221.28] P:1837.86 E:0.110721 |  The pearls are down as much as he possibly can.
[1221.28 - 1223.92] P:1833.95 E:0.115745 |  But there is no pair on the cross.
[1223.92 - 1225.28] P:1760.16 E:0.108747 |  He's given it everything.
[1225.28 - 1226.56] P:1730.92 E:0.105571 |  He's tonned his head.
[1226.56 - 1228.16] P:1808.64 E:0.100795 |  He's caught it perfectly.
[1228.16 - 1232.56] P:1706.06 E:0.102551 |  But because it's a floated cross, and he cannot get off on it.
[1232.64 - 1234.48] P:1625.17 E:0.114791 |  And it's an easy one for Sinon to deal with.
[1234.48 - 1238.24] P:1613.23 E:0.104438 |  But the first and best chance so far for the Germans.
[1239.36 - 1240.48] P:1408.89 E:0.124014 |  It remains 0-0.
[1240.48 - 1244.56] P:1588.14 E:0.108529 |  Ball goes direct from Simo down to Dani Almo,
[1244.56 - 1247.44] P:1570.07 E:0.104706 |  who at the minute is playing almost through the middle.
[1247.44 - 1249.68] P:1774.99 E:0.107108 |  Because Lameen Yamal has gone out to the right.
[1249.68 - 1251.92] P:1645.01 E:0.105806 |  Marata is at the moment to the left.
[1251.92 - 1254.80] P:1802.77 E:0.103098 |  And Williams has actually gone into a much more deeper role.
[1255.36 - 1257.04] P:1786.76 E:0.105907 |  Nico Williams for the time being.
[1257.04 - 1258.88] P:1636.72 E:0.099094 |  It remains 0-0 here in Stuttgart.
[1258.88 - 1260.32] P:1727.15 E:0.093008 |  21 minutes played.
[1260.32 - 1262.32] P:1748.89 E:0.097369 |  Rodgery wins the ball in the midfield.
[1262.32 - 1264.48] P:1622.89 E:0.095649 |  Fabian will play it back to Leynor Mann.
[1264.48 - 1266.88] P:1683.44 E:0.089463 |  Let's get another update from Wimbledon, Ian Carter.
[1266.88 - 1270.16] P:1763.91 E:0.096040 |  Carlos Alcaraff, the defending champion in cruise control now.
[1270.16 - 1272.80] P:1765.69 E:0.099082 |  Eventually, 3 hours 42 minutes on the clock.
[1272.80 - 1276.40] P:1615.64 E:0.091232 |  But he's leading now with two breaks of serve in the deciding set.
[1276.40 - 1279.52] P:1755.98 E:0.097375 |  Against Francis Tiofo by four games to one.
[1280.40 - 1280.96] P:1838.39 E:0.108454 |  Thank you Ian.
[1280.96 - 1283.04] P:1793.16 E:0.115847 |  commentary continues on sports extra.
[1284.08 - 1288.56] P:1832.35 E:0.106604 |  As Simon just puts his foot on the ball a couple of times.
[1288.56 - 1289.60] P:1847.91 E:0.108836 |  Hits it right footed.
[1289.60 - 1291.68] P:1780.22 E:0.099617 |  Again looking for that ball down the middle.
[1291.68 - 1295.52] P:1786.65 E:0.105042 |  Rudergat who will miss the semifinals should Germany go through.
[1296.16 - 1298.72] P:1740.02 E:0.097483 |  After that yellow card after 13 minutes.
[1298.72 - 1304.00] P:1664.84 E:0.092698 |  Back then to Ettenoya who is today making a little bit of German history.
[1304.00 - 1307.76] P:1734.59 E:0.103960 |  He's the top appearance maker for Germany in major tournaments.
[1307.76 - 1311.36] P:1779.53 E:0.108156 |  With his 39th appearance beating the record set by,
[1311.36 - 1314.00] P:1827.95 E:0.093630 |  or held jointly by Bastian Schweinsteiger.
[1314.88 - 1319.60] P:1673.45 E:0.103244 |  Only Ronaldo has actually played more games in major tournaments than Manuel Neuer.
[1320.56 - 1326.00] P:1891.55 E:0.109827 |  In Manuel Neuer, what a servant he has been over the years.
[1326.00 - 1326.96] P:1779.02 E:0.105315 |  38 now.
[1326.96 - 1330.00] P:1643.79 E:0.098827 |  There's the German support behind him in that goal.
[1330.00 - 1331.20] P:1676.10 E:0.102510 |  He can put them down in unison.
[1331.20 - 1332.24] P:1608.05 E:0.098227 |  It's the port.
[1332.24 - 1335.36] P:1726.89 E:0.109683 |  Drills one in from 25 yards out left footed.
[1335.36 - 1336.48] P:1748.19 E:0.101000 |  Saved at the second attempt.
[1336.48 - 1337.60] P:1719.94 E:0.101953 |  It remains goalless.
[1337.60 - 1339.20] P:1598.24 E:0.110734 |  Saved at the second attempt.
[1339.20 - 1341.68] P:1685.99 E:0.118818 |  I remember seeing that somewhere else quite recently.
[1342.40 - 1344.24] P:1636.98 E:0.115236 |  In Champions League semifinal.
[1344.24 - 1345.60] P:1541.39 E:0.110102 |  Now I made a mistake.
[1345.60 - 1347.52] P:1575.16 E:0.115978 |  But that's him he managed to recover it a little bit.
[1348.24 - 1349.52] P:1750.21 E:0.133591 |  I'm drinking the way it's gone here.
[1349.52 - 1352.48] P:1747.62 E:0.107310 |  You know, it's trying to be controlled by the Germans.
[1352.48 - 1355.76] P:1722.02 E:0.092063 |  But you're looking out there and if you're Spain you're thinking,
[1355.76 - 1360.32] P:1664.21 E:0.096119 |  Kimmy, brilliant player, but not blessed with a huge amount of pace anymore.
[1360.32 - 1361.44] P:1362.00 E:0.101173 |  He's getting on a lot a bit.
[1361.44 - 1362.80] P:1743.04 E:0.092613 |  Ram, good feel by it.
[1362.80 - 1365.20] P:1735.83 E:0.094474 |  But again, not absolute lightning pace.
[1365.20 - 1368.56] P:1652.61 E:0.100505 |  And you look at the pace that's out wide for that Spanish team.
[1368.56 - 1369.84] P:1566.87 E:0.104980 |  They got together those winners.
[1369.84 - 1371.52] P:1528.69 E:0.098364 |  A bit more of the ball further up the field.
[1372.32 - 1375.68] P:1711.64 E:0.102677 |  You can see though there is a respect between the two sides, isn't there?
[1375.68 - 1376.24] P:1690.26 E:0.110172 |  Absolutely.
[1376.96 - 1380.32] P:1691.88 E:0.094769 |  Funny because they understandably, we got a bit excited
[1380.32 - 1382.56] P:1599.37 E:0.102454 |  at the start of the game and tackles the flying end.
[1382.56 - 1384.16] P:1580.15 E:0.112212 |  There's about 100mph stuff.
[1384.80 - 1388.64] P:1595.97 E:0.102122 |  It has settled a little bit now and they're maybe slightly over respectful
[1388.64 - 1389.76] P:1474.14 E:0.098562 |  for the last three or four minutes.
[1391.12 - 1393.60] P:1617.62 E:0.108951 |  Here is Rudiger, short of the halfway line.
[1394.24 - 1397.04] P:1697.33 E:0.109400 |  Round was just starting to go off on a run on that far side.
[1397.60 - 1401.28] P:1717.15 E:0.099886 |  Every time he goes forward, he takes Laminio Malt back with him.
[1401.28 - 1403.20] P:1744.49 E:0.107734 |  As the move breaks down on this near side,
[1403.20 - 1405.44] P:1725.11 E:0.093894 |  a ball towards Kimmy, too far ahead of him.
[1405.44 - 1407.68] P:1678.09 E:0.098442 |  It'll be a Spain throw midway through their own half.
[1408.88 - 1412.00] P:1754.62 E:0.096014 |  You look actually at the last four meetings at major tournaments.
[1412.00 - 1414.08] P:1740.74 E:0.087551 |  Spain have won two, they've drawn two.
[1414.08 - 1416.40] P:1651.16 E:0.095358 |  But only six goals scored between them.
[1417.52 - 1420.64] P:1677.24 E:0.107189 |  So I guess maybe it was always going to be a tight contest here.
[1421.44 - 1425.04] P:1609.81 E:0.089726 |  As Sane gets momentarily away from Cucaraya.
[1425.04 - 1427.84] P:1753.90 E:0.116572 |  Kimmick helps out, the Rattery's back leans into Kimmick.
[1427.84 - 1430.72] P:1872.25 E:0.112178 |  That was a foul and it will be a free kick to Germany,
[1430.72 - 1433.44] P:1866.55 E:0.104865 |  just in from the right touch line on this near side.
[1433.44 - 1436.24] P:1707.42 E:0.106572 |  Senefovos tackle there, there's no use at all.
[1436.24 - 1437.20] P:1746.43 E:0.107514 |  He's just shoved them off.
[1437.20 - 1439.84] P:1709.68 E:0.099181 |  Kimmick knows what he's doing, he's pitched his body in the way.
[1439.84 - 1442.40] P:1628.82 E:0.107968 |  But to give a free kick away, when Kimmick's going lower,
[1442.40 - 1444.08] P:1575.79 E:0.089732 |  he's just going into the corner.
[1444.08 - 1445.44] P:1648.42 E:0.108114 |  Silly free kick to give away.
[1445.44 - 1448.88] P:1538.59 E:0.098518 |  When you consider the power of Tar, Rudiger,
[1448.88 - 1450.32] P:1441.69 E:0.104765 |  Havertz in the middle there,
[1450.32 - 1453.60] P:1548.86 E:0.100413 |  he's got a great chance to put it in from a dangerous area here.
[1454.88 - 1457.20] P:1729.74 E:0.109058 |  And those players that Pass has mentioned,
[1457.20 - 1461.04] P:1697.81 E:0.106092 |  along with Gunduan, are lurking as four white shirts
[1461.04 - 1462.80] P:1676.18 E:0.105119 |  inside the penalty area.
[1462.80 - 1466.56] P:1777.32 E:0.102435 |  Sane have every red shirt back inside the box.
[1466.56 - 1468.32] P:1711.61 E:0.116369 |  Anthony Taylor, the English referee,
[1469.04 - 1471.12] P:1777.80 E:0.116186 |  is just having a word with Jonathan Tar.
[1471.12 - 1475.44] P:1795.71 E:0.096158 |  There is an air of expectation and anticipation
[1476.08 - 1477.84] P:1730.31 E:0.111502 |  here inside the Stuttgart Arena.
[1478.64 - 1480.64] P:1613.60 E:0.110620 |  It's crosed with a delivery, right footed.
[1480.64 - 1482.72] P:1737.43 E:0.094316 |  Rudiger climbs as does Tar.
[1482.72 - 1485.92] P:1724.28 E:0.093883 |  And then that header just drops down off Tar and is picked up.
[1485.92 - 1489.52] P:1653.47 E:0.104989 |  And then lobbed out by the right hand of Uno Simon.
[1490.24 - 1492.88] P:1735.20 E:0.113502 |  And Williams is a judge to a foul David Raum.
[1492.88 - 1495.28] P:1838.14 E:0.103817 |  And that will be another free kick to Germany,
[1495.28 - 1496.72] P:1742.56 E:0.096512 |  midway through the Spaniard.
[1496.72 - 1499.28] P:1703.34 E:0.114026 |  Very, very straight through, wasn't it?
[1499.28 - 1501.68] P:1642.90 E:0.113083 |  I think he was caught in two mains as he threw the ball out there.
[1501.68 - 1503.12] P:1564.28 E:0.090204 |  But what they wanted to,
[1503.12 - 1505.84] P:1629.85 E:0.101718 |  is when they get the ball from deep to Spanish,
[1505.84 - 1508.64] P:1596.79 E:0.112988 |  they know that the white players have got better pace
[1508.64 - 1511.92] P:1672.21 E:0.103211 |  than their opponents, with the exception of Rudiger who's central.
[1511.92 - 1513.92] P:1758.98 E:0.112516 |  So he's trying to get out to those white areas,
[1513.92 - 1516.08] P:1591.09 E:0.095242 |  but quite simply the ball wasn't on there.
[1516.32 - 1522.16] P:1744.73 E:0.090080 |  So this free kick must be 15 yards into the Spain half.
[1522.96 - 1525.84] P:1639.13 E:0.096578 |  10 yards in from the left touch line on that far side.
[1527.44 - 1530.64] P:1618.54 E:0.104591 |  Gross eventually is going to place the ball down, just spins it.
[1531.92 - 1533.36] P:1504.99 E:0.110705 |  Takes a couple of steps back.
[1533.36 - 1536.16] P:1663.84 E:0.107394 |  Quite a high line though, this from Spain with their red shirts.
[1537.04 - 1538.32] P:1641.96 E:0.112316 |  Just outside the deep.
[1538.32 - 1540.96] P:1669.37 E:0.095581 |  So there's a lot of protection there for Uno Simon.
[1540.96 - 1543.04] P:1808.89 E:0.093573 |  As it goes deep, Le Porte stretching.
[1543.04 - 1544.16] P:1765.92 E:0.105326 |  Does it touch his head?
[1544.16 - 1545.04] P:1775.44 E:0.104492 |  Yes, it does.
[1545.12 - 1546.80] P:1818.12 E:0.113823 |  It'll be a corner kick to Germany.
[1546.80 - 1550.00] P:1805.68 E:0.108896 |  Very good with their corner kicks in the free kicks of Germans.
[1550.00 - 1552.24] P:1765.58 E:0.115796 |  Very noticeable in the last game they scored one.
[1552.24 - 1555.28] P:1631.57 E:0.101267 |  It was chopped off because of a very, very obvious block.
[1555.92 - 1558.24] P:1607.25 E:0.103742 |  But on that occasion, I kept an eye on Rudiger.
[1558.24 - 1561.04] P:1661.50 E:0.112017 |  He must have made a 30-yard run,
[1561.04 - 1563.68] P:1693.90 E:0.108658 |  knowing exactly where the ball was going to end up.
[1563.68 - 1566.08] P:1612.83 E:0.115801 |  He was unlucky not to get in the end of it, but they have got a corner.
[1568.48 - 1571.20] P:1809.94 E:0.116320 |  So this should be an out-stringing corner from Tony Cross
[1571.20 - 1572.56] P:1773.61 E:0.116942 |  on this near side, the right.
[1575.52 - 1577.52] P:1791.62 E:0.120443 |  Rudiger is trying to get away from Le Normand.
[1577.52 - 1580.00] P:1813.17 E:0.107076 |  The referee's got to split the two of them for the time being.
[1580.64 - 1583.20] P:1799.56 E:0.109027 |  Havert, Tahr, Chan are all lurking.
[1583.76 - 1587.36] P:1856.99 E:0.101562 |  Inside the six-yard box, you've got Gunduan in there.
[1588.16 - 1589.52] P:1773.08 E:0.108874 |  Kimmich in there too.
[1589.52 - 1590.48] P:1644.03 E:0.103653 |  And it comes now.
[1590.48 - 1592.00] P:1758.65 E:0.097825 |  Tahr tries to get on the end of it.
[1592.00 - 1594.88] P:1803.22 E:0.102277 |  Chan heads it, Goldwoods and Uno Simon,
[1594.88 - 1597.12] P:1791.55 E:0.103611 |  after stumbling over a couple of German players,
[1597.68 - 1601.68] P:1752.07 E:0.093522 |  literally takes it off the head of Gunduan and throws it out.
[1602.56 - 1604.56] P:1706.35 E:0.095507 |  And now it's with Fabian for Spain.
[1604.64 - 1607.68] P:1751.20 E:0.094674 |  Waits for the running, supporting run of Kukereya to his left.
[1608.24 - 1610.56] P:1793.97 E:0.099888 |  Trots his way towards the halfway line.
[1610.56 - 1612.16] P:1795.50 E:0.092870 |  27 minutes played.
[1612.16 - 1614.08] P:1684.73 E:0.109785 |  Rodgery, he passes the ball forward.
[1614.72 - 1615.84] P:1729.10 E:0.107150 |  Williams is onto it.
[1615.84 - 1617.28] P:1581.75 E:0.109387 |  Sane's the one who backpedals.
[1617.28 - 1620.40] P:1777.73 E:0.105433 |  Williams goes on the outside, ships the ball to the far post.
[1620.96 - 1626.40] P:1775.48 E:0.098742 |  And Raum should clear this with La Mignamal in pursuit.
[1626.40 - 1628.48] P:1738.36 E:0.103035 |  Calva Halber with the interception.
[1629.12 - 1631.36] P:1597.75 E:0.104038 |  And then he was chopped from behind.
[1631.36 - 1633.12] P:1760.57 E:0.109490 |  And it'll be a free kick to Spain.
[1633.20 - 1635.52] P:1722.70 E:0.116242 |  And Anthony Taylor is going to show another yellow card.
[1635.52 - 1636.80] P:1879.81 E:0.107161 |  Incorrect again.
[1636.80 - 1637.76] P:1961.21 E:0.111697 |  Absolutely.
[1637.76 - 1642.24] P:1896.34 E:0.113043 |  And the Germans are getting possibly rough house tactics now.
[1642.24 - 1643.76] P:1873.95 E:0.105709 |  They're going into his tackles.
[1643.76 - 1646.56] P:1672.56 E:0.115223 |  And if you don't win the ball, you know how to keep on going through.
[1646.56 - 1648.56] P:1810.88 E:0.093577 |  And he's straight through.
[1648.56 - 1650.08] P:1803.92 E:0.097789 |  Actually, it's one of those ones.
[1650.08 - 1652.00] P:1771.73 E:0.071599 |  I just don't think his feet are quicker off.
[1652.00 - 1655.36] P:1662.54 E:0.108751 |  He's tried to get the man and he's just wept out Calva Halber.
[1656.08 - 1657.52] P:1569.28 E:0.105178 |  And he's not going to stand on his feet.
[1657.52 - 1660.32] P:1739.03 E:0.095484 |  Just before that, Niko Williams gets his first opportunity.
[1660.32 - 1663.52] P:1739.18 E:0.080216 |  They're defending the final thought effortless.
[1663.52 - 1664.48] P:1558.02 E:0.114112 |  Gets to the byline.
[1664.48 - 1668.56] P:1691.30 E:0.099348 |  And after a five, six, seven minute good period for the Germans,
[1668.56 - 1669.76] P:1848.93 E:0.104432 |  they're under pressure again.
[1670.56 - 1672.00] P:1899.91 E:0.121138 |  Raum then shown a yellow card.
[1672.00 - 1674.56] P:1917.85 E:0.106370 |  The second German player to be booked by Anthony Taylor.
[1674.56 - 1677.68] P:1908.77 E:0.107849 |  Free kick to Spain level with the penalty area far side to right.
[1677.68 - 1679.68] P:1978.36 E:0.104136 |  Twenty-eight minutes played, still goalless.
[1681.20 - 1684.64] P:1987.94 E:0.110694 |  Yamal threatens to take it, leaves it for Williams.
[1684.64 - 1688.32] P:1712.48 E:0.099867 |  It's curling in now up towards Rodgery, headed away by Gross.
[1688.32 - 1690.00] P:1720.65 E:0.108399 |  Only as far as Olmo.
[1690.00 - 1693.12] P:1626.25 E:0.102237 |  He's then tried to hit it and he's missed it.
[1693.12 - 1696.96] P:1688.85 E:0.103703 |  And by actually catching Gunduan in the process,
[1696.96 - 1698.80] P:1760.96 E:0.100121 |  Gunduan's hobbling his back on his feet,
[1698.80 - 1701.44] P:1718.07 E:0.092542 |  tries to stamp off the effects of that challenge.
[1701.44 - 1703.20] P:1570.41 E:0.089855 |  It'll be a free kick to Germany.
[1703.20 - 1706.72] P:1561.22 E:0.101363 |  Yeah, I think his referee's got that one right.
[1706.72 - 1708.24] P:1568.75 E:0.103041 |  Gets a lot about the ball.
[1708.24 - 1709.20] P:1801.13 E:0.108091 |  And almost just trying.
[1709.20 - 1711.12] P:1772.12 E:0.105680 |  He doesn't see the tackle coming in.
[1711.12 - 1713.20] P:1700.14 E:0.116158 |  It's a free kick. Absolutely nothing more than that.
[1714.88 - 1719.20] P:1745.32 E:0.113458 |  Well, you consider that Petri had a low shot for Spain after 56 seconds.
[1719.20 - 1723.76] P:1732.11 E:0.104187 |  He's since left the field through an injury to be replaced by Olmo.
[1723.76 - 1726.16] P:1746.22 E:0.110660 |  And Neuer is saved from Le Porte's low drive.
[1726.72 - 1729.04] P:1633.94 E:0.091132 |  Simon saved from a Havertz header.
[1729.04 - 1732.08] P:1581.01 E:0.090120 |  And that's been about it as we approach the half-hour mark.
[1732.08 - 1734.16] P:1739.84 E:0.106992 |  Ball goes astray. Gunduan on to it.
[1734.16 - 1735.68] P:1686.86 E:0.120872 |  Then he was caught by Le Normand.
[1736.24 - 1738.56] P:1854.16 E:0.119038 |  Le Normand could be in trouble here.
[1739.20 - 1742.24] P:1880.13 E:0.118026 |  Because if he's shown a yellow card, he'll be suspended.
[1742.24 - 1743.20] P:1696.42 E:0.113958 |  And there it is.
[1743.20 - 1745.36] P:1825.96 E:0.104473 |  The first Spanish player to get a booking.
[1745.36 - 1748.32] P:1838.98 E:0.100992 |  And like Rudiger, the central defender for Spain.
[1748.32 - 1751.52] P:1773.29 E:0.088360 |  If Spain progress, we'll be banned for the semifinal.
[1751.52 - 1754.08] P:1662.21 E:0.092097 |  Awful decision. Terrible decision.
[1754.64 - 1756.24] P:1718.24 E:0.114344 |  He's just come out close to him behind him.
[1756.24 - 1760.64] P:1706.43 E:0.101638 |  And he's thrown himself to the ground there at the very, very most, a free kick.
[1761.36 - 1764.80] P:1672.53 E:0.102945 |  And he's just going to play it a possibility, a semifinal for that.
[1764.80 - 1766.48] P:1583.17 E:0.090566 |  That's a very pro decision.
[1767.60 - 1770.48] P:1646.03 E:0.098439 |  Nil Nil. 15 minutes to go to half-time.
[1770.48 - 1771.92] P:1656.13 E:0.071947 |  Kroos. Kymik.
[1773.44 - 1776.48] P:1538.00 E:0.109014 |  Passes the ball back to the halfway line for Jonathan Tarr.
[1776.48 - 1778.64] P:1656.92 E:0.088213 |  This tall central defender.
[1778.64 - 1783.04] P:1535.00 E:0.103361 |  He won the title for Bayer Leibacuzn in their sensational season that they had here.
[1783.68 - 1785.52] P:1386.40 E:0.093999 |  Back with Tarr once again.
[1785.52 - 1786.96] P:1549.96 E:0.099188 |  Just coming back from a ban.
[1786.96 - 1789.76] P:1498.86 E:0.108649 |  So he missed that last 16 encounter against Denmark.
[1790.64 - 1792.08] P:1548.97 E:0.105686 |  As the ball is forward.
[1792.08 - 1794.48] P:1573.36 E:0.109460 |  And now with Tarr out towards that far side.
[1794.48 - 1795.60] P:1414.51 E:0.088159 |  And they're building.
[1795.60 - 1796.88] P:1593.55 E:0.111562 |  Round on the left-hand side.
[1796.88 - 1798.08] P:1696.79 E:0.105235 |  Close down by Carvajal.
[1798.08 - 1799.52] P:1811.61 E:0.108090 |  Gets away. Edge of the area.
[1799.52 - 1800.96] P:1777.89 E:0.098680 |  Chan to the edge of the box.
[1800.96 - 1802.64] P:1672.70 E:0.101662 |  Chan loses his balance.
[1802.64 - 1804.00] P:1782.73 E:0.104601 |  Spain can't keep the ball.
[1804.00 - 1805.44] P:1721.38 E:0.082284 |  Played back by Tarr.
[1805.52 - 1807.68] P:1712.11 E:0.088266 |  Sane right corner of the box.
[1807.68 - 1809.20] P:1804.99 E:0.107688 |  Headed away by Carvajal.
[1810.00 - 1812.48] P:1828.53 E:0.096938 |  It's a throw to Germany.
[1812.48 - 1813.76] P:1879.25 E:0.085973 |  Which Kymik will take quickly.
[1813.76 - 1815.44] P:1669.55 E:0.100448 |  They try and keep that momentum going.
[1816.16 - 1818.24] P:1797.34 E:0.105590 |  With 14 minutes to go to half-time.
[1818.24 - 1819.52] P:1784.94 E:0.099956 |  Kymik on this near side.
[1819.52 - 1820.64] P:1801.24 E:0.081128 |  Havertz waits.
[1820.64 - 1821.04] P:1854.76 E:0.082494 |  Kymik.
[1822.32 - 1823.68] P:1694.17 E:0.118040 |  Passes the ball in field.
[1823.68 - 1825.84] P:1741.80 E:0.097715 |  Tarr forward of the centre circle.
[1826.64 - 1828.32] P:1744.16 E:0.116217 |  Back with Rudiger once again.
[1828.32 - 1831.60] P:1850.86 E:0.102967 |  Spain just trying to keep that high line as Sane.
[1831.60 - 1833.36] P:1825.64 E:0.109987 |  Back by the buoyant German support.
[1833.36 - 1835.12] P:1767.32 E:0.104958 |  Kymik though held up by Fabian.
[1835.44 - 1836.24] P:1881.92 E:0.117506 |  Towards Croes.
[1836.24 - 1838.16] P:1753.64 E:0.103829 |  They're trying to prise their way.
[1838.16 - 1839.84] P:1786.04 E:0.094863 |  Passed the Spanish side.
[1839.84 - 1840.88] P:1872.47 E:0.106067 |  Tarr steps forward.
[1841.60 - 1842.80] P:1769.51 E:0.111699 |  Forward of the centre circle.
[1842.80 - 1844.56] P:1691.48 E:0.088726 |  Gets the ball back by Chan.
[1844.56 - 1846.00] P:1739.72 E:0.105057 |  Passes it now to Gunduan.
[1846.00 - 1847.84] P:1725.44 E:0.096792 |  Gunduan to Mussiala.
[1847.84 - 1850.00] P:1741.87 E:0.098636 |  And now all of a sudden there's a break on for Spain.
[1850.00 - 1851.68] P:1754.40 E:0.111169 |  La Mena Malo over on that far side.
[1851.68 - 1852.88] P:1550.96 E:0.108502 |  He's over the halfway line.
[1852.88 - 1854.00] P:1828.41 E:0.095464 |  And then he's fouled.
[1854.00 - 1856.24] P:1795.22 E:0.108800 |  Let's get an update from Ian Carter at Wimbledon.
[1856.24 - 1859.36] P:1822.60 E:0.104368 |  Carlos Alcaraft safely through the defending champion.
[1859.36 - 1860.88] P:1830.76 E:0.105476 |  Coming through a five-setter.
[1860.88 - 1864.72] P:1723.05 E:0.103999 |  Three and three-quarter hours on court against France's TFO.
[1864.72 - 1865.92] P:1739.71 E:0.106741 |  But in the end he did it.
[1865.92 - 1870.08] P:1612.55 E:0.099252 |  Five, seven, six, two, four, six, seven, six, six, two.
[1870.08 - 1872.40] P:1592.48 E:0.094021 |  Next up on centre, Emma Radacana.
[1873.44 - 1876.32] P:1715.20 E:0.106601 |  Regular updates here on Five Live and BBC South.
[1876.32 - 1879.44] P:1929.89 E:0.107477 |  The tennis coverage continues on Sports Extra.
[1879.44 - 1882.00] P:1953.67 E:0.112522 |  Chan was not booked for that challenge on La Mena Malo.
[1882.00 - 1883.36] P:1981.37 E:0.121467 |  Yeah, it's getting a wee bit bizarre.
[1883.92 - 1886.32] P:1851.35 E:0.111254 |  I don't think Anthony's having his best day out there.
[1886.32 - 1889.84] P:1814.68 E:0.107819 |  How he can book for Le Mans, Le Mans for what he done.
[1890.48 - 1892.48] P:1989.61 E:0.126232 |  And then not book Chan for that.
[1893.28 - 1894.88] P:1980.27 E:0.117888 |  It's utterly beyond me.
[1894.88 - 1896.16] P:1974.80 E:0.110592 |  Utterly beyond me.
[1896.16 - 1897.68] P:1999.41 E:0.120309 |  It seems really strange.
[1897.68 - 1899.76] P:1948.49 E:0.106187 |  If you're Spanish just now watching this,
[1899.76 - 1902.24] P:1856.17 E:0.099978 |  you'll be very confused and very angry.
[1903.28 - 1905.52] P:1905.24 E:0.108949 |  The sun continues to shine in Stuttgart.
[1905.52 - 1908.56] P:1883.87 E:0.107002 |  It remains 0-0 with 12 minutes to go to half-time.
[1909.92 - 1911.76] P:1913.78 E:0.117718 |  Very cagey affair here.
[1913.12 - 1916.80] P:1704.92 E:0.106057 |  As Le Mans, Carvajal on the halfway line.
[1916.80 - 1918.72] P:1689.33 E:0.108381 |  Pushing the ball past Mussiala.
[1918.72 - 1919.28] P:1490.80 E:0.109481 |  Round-o.
[1920.00 - 1921.04] P:1765.29 E:0.108503 |  Quickly dealt with it.
[1921.12 - 1922.64] P:1695.57 E:0.105382 |  Wins the ball back for Germany.
[1922.64 - 1925.28] P:1772.70 E:0.098284 |  Carvajal, though, chases and hassles.
[1925.28 - 1928.64] P:1717.57 E:0.099806 |  And Harris, his Real Madrid teammate, Anthony Rudiger.
[1928.64 - 1932.72] P:1837.60 E:0.089369 |  But they try and beat the press from Spain.
[1932.72 - 1934.24] P:1629.68 E:0.090781 |  Keeping the ball at the back.
[1934.24 - 1936.48] P:1751.89 E:0.084177 |  Cross, of course, an integral part.
[1936.48 - 1938.32] P:1657.99 E:0.098343 |  Once again, just linking up the play.
[1939.36 - 1943.44] P:1712.77 E:0.087874 |  Rudiger to Kimmich, held up by Williams.
[1944.64 - 1946.00] P:1702.60 E:0.102642 |  And then just strokes it back.
[1946.80 - 1949.76] P:1505.87 E:0.098895 |  Mussiala's had a quiet game so far.
[1949.76 - 1950.96] P:1574.58 E:0.108429 |  Just can't go into the ball.
[1950.96 - 1954.56] P:1650.20 E:0.097328 |  If you're a wide player, you need to get the ball in the final third.
[1954.56 - 1957.12] P:1730.34 E:0.088607 |  Preferably one-on-one at half a chance.
[1957.12 - 1958.64] P:1607.87 E:0.115918 |  You won't get that many opportunities,
[1958.64 - 1960.64] P:1598.39 E:0.108852 |  but you've got to take them, but he's not had one yet.
[1960.64 - 1962.56] P:1835.25 E:0.117184 |  Marata forward, ball towards Olmo.
[1962.56 - 1967.04] P:1728.97 E:0.106321 |  Sliding was tart and did just enough to see it back towards Neuer.
[1968.48 - 1972.48] P:1783.49 E:0.101261 |  There was just a glimpse of an opening, maybe, for Dani Olmo.
[1973.20 - 1976.40] P:1718.03 E:0.105087 |  That's just something slightly more sprightly about the Spanish.
[1976.40 - 1978.16] P:1666.10 E:0.113294 |  You're a little bit sharper about Spanish.
[1978.72 - 1980.96] P:1538.11 E:0.113224 |  That's not to say that the Germans are lumping,
[1980.96 - 1983.04] P:1768.30 E:0.108570 |  but they need to control this.
[1983.04 - 1985.76] P:1661.49 E:0.105640 |  They need to use their physicality, and they have doing so.
[1985.76 - 1988.96] P:1696.96 E:0.093444 |  Here is Havertz. Can't get past Rodgery.
[1988.96 - 1992.08] P:1703.75 E:0.099547 |  Referee almost gets in the way. Havertz, though, with Chan.
[1992.64 - 1997.20] P:1773.83 E:0.088035 |  Kimmich had gone into a rolling field on the edge of the area.
[1997.20 - 1998.16] P:1612.70 E:0.115061 |  Now has to go out wide.
[1998.16 - 1999.52] P:1655.24 E:0.110741 |  Here is Kimmich, plays it in low.
[1999.52 - 2000.88] P:1803.39 E:0.105492 |  Seamon wouldn't have counted.
[2000.88 - 2003.60] P:1838.24 E:0.107474 |  Flag was up on this near side, and it will be...
[2003.60 - 2005.92] P:1869.14 E:0.101959 |  Like that, the referee will just let play continue with it.
[2005.92 - 2008.08] P:1834.64 E:0.096820 |  Unai Seamon with the ball at his hands,
[2008.08 - 2010.48] P:1723.78 E:0.101085 |  and it is still 0-0, just over 10 minutes to the break.
[2010.48 - 2012.56] P:1533.42 E:0.108241 |  It was a special play by Havertz, wasn't it?
[2012.56 - 2015.20] P:1617.43 E:0.098821 |  He held up so well. Everyone was coming through.
[2015.20 - 2016.64] P:1676.83 E:0.109682 |  He was almost playing as a 10.
[2016.64 - 2018.64] P:1466.90 E:0.105651 |  He does that, false nine quite a lot himself.
[2019.36 - 2022.72] P:1659.93 E:0.110789 |  Lovely play, and Kimmich had just made the run a little bit too quickly.
[2023.92 - 2026.72] P:1721.27 E:0.113787 |  We'll be hearing from Gareth Southgate a little later on.
[2027.52 - 2031.44] P:1777.98 E:0.105479 |  But all the latest from the England camp on the Football Daily Podcast,
[2031.44 - 2034.16] P:1828.92 E:0.099973 |  ahead of that quarterfinal tomorrow in Düsseldorf,
[2034.16 - 2037.12] P:1895.67 E:0.096341 |  live on 5 Live, and BBC sounds from 5 o'clock.
[2037.12 - 2038.32] P:1724.29 E:0.100298 |  England against Switzerland.
[2038.96 - 2041.84] P:1616.39 E:0.111183 |  And indeed, the Rugby Union Daily, likewise ahead of New Zealand,
[2041.84 - 2046.96] P:1700.69 E:0.082557 |  England in the first test, which you can hear at 5 past 8 tomorrow morning,
[2046.96 - 2048.64] P:1512.29 E:0.104970 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[2048.64 - 2051.44] P:1711.36 E:0.092162 |  What a bumper day of live sport tomorrow.
[2051.44 - 2054.80] P:1757.48 E:0.104670 |  Rudiger goes long, searching ball. Havertz off his chest.
[2054.80 - 2056.48] P:1765.19 E:0.113262 |  Havertz with the shot right footed.
[2056.48 - 2058.96] P:1783.63 E:0.107939 |  Unai Seamon with the save, away to his right.
[2058.96 - 2060.32] P:1769.02 E:0.116135 |  Movements brilliant, isn't it?
[2060.32 - 2061.12] P:1882.39 E:0.101933 |  How about...
[2061.12 - 2063.68] P:1778.72 E:0.110580 |  It does exactly what I said before, what should do.
[2063.68 - 2066.96] P:1771.15 E:0.104378 |  Runs wide, and as soon as he's slightly over-covered,
[2066.96 - 2070.16] P:1661.51 E:0.100995 |  he comes inside again and finds himself with a couple of yans there.
[2070.16 - 2073.12] P:1754.23 E:0.095018 |  Doesn't catch it clean, but that's two half-decent chances.
[2073.12 - 2075.92] P:1760.42 E:0.091984 |  He's got himself with great movement,
[2075.92 - 2078.00] P:1687.55 E:0.087632 |  but it has to be said, not great. Finish him.
[2078.88 - 2080.24] P:1636.39 E:0.104792 |  10 minutes to go to the break.
[2080.24 - 2083.04] P:1690.20 E:0.097311 |  The voice of Pat Nevin with us here in Stuttgart,
[2083.68 - 2086.32] P:1687.35 E:0.098394 |  as La Porte gets away from Sarne.
[2087.28 - 2089.36] P:1631.39 E:0.110419 |  Accelerates with Sarne now running back at him,
[2089.36 - 2092.48] P:1658.74 E:0.100339 |  and La Porte has carried that ball midway through the Germany half.
[2092.48 - 2094.88] P:1714.81 E:0.092857 |  Marathe plays it out towards Yamal.
[2094.88 - 2096.40] P:1620.26 E:0.108801 |  Yamal enters the penalty area.
[2096.40 - 2098.16] P:1803.15 E:0.106135 |  Yamal twisting and turning.
[2098.16 - 2102.08] P:1707.28 E:0.115762 |  I mean, in the end, he probably bamboozled himself to the 16-year-old.
[2102.08 - 2103.44] P:1678.16 E:0.116231 |  He's pushed off the ball by Rao.
[2103.44 - 2105.12] P:1763.38 E:0.102686 |  The German supporters like that.
[2105.12 - 2108.16] P:1791.92 E:0.108966 |  His clearance will be fixed up by Kuker Air inside the centre circle.
[2109.12 - 2110.40] P:1644.28 E:0.120552 |  He'll defend the lovesack.
[2110.40 - 2113.04] P:1669.13 E:0.100337 |  He's in seed, he's boxed, he cannot dive in there.
[2113.04 - 2116.88] P:1682.14 E:0.102971 |  He just waits for the movement from the winger on Yamal.
[2116.88 - 2118.16] P:1678.69 E:0.103054 |  And he does run too much,
[2118.16 - 2119.84] P:1717.36 E:0.100652 |  but he shouldn't get downhearted about that.
[2119.84 - 2120.72] P:1622.44 E:0.087843 |  He's looked dangerous.
[2120.72 - 2123.20] P:1756.50 E:0.110439 |  Olmo finds Williams round the back,
[2123.20 - 2126.48] P:1736.05 E:0.111118 |  opens up for Williams, and Neuer makes the save at his near post.
[2126.48 - 2127.36] P:1841.62 E:0.109517 |  Flags up again.
[2128.08 - 2129.68] P:1737.24 E:0.117285 |  Yeah, but they're coming so close, aren't they?
[2130.56 - 2133.52] P:1677.30 E:0.108204 |  Every time they play a ball wide, the Spanish look dangerous.
[2133.52 - 2135.60] P:1680.04 E:0.093290 |  That one was very, very tight indeed.
[2135.60 - 2139.28] P:1710.08 E:0.095526 |  The assistant referee's got it right most of the time up until now.
[2139.28 - 2140.96] P:1676.49 E:0.093758 |  Not so sure about that one.
[2140.96 - 2143.28] P:1621.91 E:0.105602 |  I think that's when you definitely tried the lines.
[2143.28 - 2144.64] P:1692.76 E:0.103318 |  You could not tell by the naked eye.
[2145.36 - 2148.56] P:1631.10 E:0.088571 |  What has Moussiala then got to do to get more involved?
[2148.56 - 2150.64] P:1584.25 E:0.113451 |  It's really hard though, because if you're playing in a system,
[2150.64 - 2152.80] P:1623.36 E:0.103427 |  you're asked, because most teams at the moment,
[2152.80 - 2155.68] P:1714.00 E:0.082821 |  if you're playing with wide players, you're told,
[2155.68 - 2159.04] P:1764.81 E:0.085548 |  get as wide as you can, stretch the game, develop the space.
[2159.04 - 2161.44] P:1598.16 E:0.098205 |  But if there's no one passing you to do that, you're stuffed.
[2161.44 - 2163.20] P:1570.70 E:0.100510 |  You'd like to come in looking for it,
[2163.20 - 2165.20] P:1708.89 E:0.110053 |  but if the system says you need to drag wide,
[2165.84 - 2168.56] P:1665.39 E:0.105881 |  you have no option, you need to do it until the ball comes to you.
[2168.56 - 2171.84] P:1737.58 E:0.106742 |  So far, him and, it has to be said, Zani as well.
[2171.84 - 2174.08] P:1627.58 E:0.103140 |  They've got very, very little ball in the last dug.
[2174.72 - 2176.00] P:1750.80 E:0.114107 |  Here is Cook Araya.
[2176.48 - 2178.72] P:1699.67 E:0.115394 |  Certainly when you contrast that to William Zanayamal.
[2178.72 - 2181.76] P:1728.05 E:0.113431 |  Yeah, and they've got a little bit of space to run into.
[2181.76 - 2183.68] P:1767.97 E:0.107746 |  The way that the Spanish are playing it,
[2184.32 - 2186.96] P:1820.43 E:0.103122 |  they play it so quick from back to front.
[2186.96 - 2189.60] P:1728.07 E:0.110943 |  It'll only be one or two passes, but it'll be done with such speed
[2190.24 - 2192.16] P:1661.34 E:0.114069 |  that they've got space to run into.
[2192.16 - 2194.96] P:1696.51 E:0.101718 |  As we are looking just now, look at the 40-50 yards
[2194.96 - 2197.20] P:1601.92 E:0.111827 |  between the back line and the Germans and the goalkeeper.
[2197.76 - 2200.72] P:1655.46 E:0.101783 |  That's great if you're a wide player with some pace to run into.
[2201.60 - 2205.68] P:1751.54 E:0.100251 |  Still awaiting the first goal and this first at the quarter finals.
[2206.40 - 2209.04] P:1650.36 E:0.110656 |  Maratta reacted there to Jonathan Tav.
[2209.04 - 2211.36] P:1680.24 E:0.107288 |  I think he was just slightly caught on the back of the head
[2211.92 - 2212.96] P:1698.88 E:0.101588 |  and he didn't like it.
[2214.56 - 2217.20] P:1691.35 E:0.100644 |  Meanwhile, it's Chan who's gone down.
[2217.20 - 2219.76] P:1657.87 E:0.091965 |  Maratta will just have a word with Anthony Taylor,
[2219.76 - 2222.80] P:1692.25 E:0.096417 |  but it's a free kick to Germany on the edge of their own centre circle.
[2224.16 - 2225.68] P:1441.34 E:0.118405 |  Maratta, be very careful.
[2226.32 - 2229.20] P:1507.89 E:0.110546 |  There's nothing very good towards the Spanish so far in the FAD.
[2230.88 - 2232.88] P:1604.28 E:0.113132 |  I mean, they should actually have both, they should have crossed.
[2233.76 - 2235.68] P:1644.17 E:0.102159 |  And Chan should be both booked.
[2235.68 - 2237.20] P:1625.24 E:0.098403 |  We know, definitely should both be booked.
[2237.20 - 2239.28] P:1713.38 E:0.089335 |  If you get two centre midfield players,
[2239.28 - 2242.16] P:1675.15 E:0.092250 |  both on yellow counts against pace, the players against them,
[2242.72 - 2243.76] P:1350.33 E:0.101944 |  that would be real danger.
[2243.76 - 2245.52] P:1403.53 E:0.090438 |  And as neither is booked.
[2246.08 - 2251.28] P:1748.14 E:0.088994 |  Olmo, Fabian in the centre circle for Spain, plays it out wide.
[2252.00 - 2256.00] P:1671.63 E:0.094490 |  That mop of dark hair of Cucaraya, who's held up by Sane,
[2256.00 - 2257.52] P:1726.18 E:0.097345 |  has to go back to La Porte.
[2258.56 - 2261.20] P:1798.23 E:0.107995 |  He can come forward over the halfway line for the red of Spain.
[2261.20 - 2265.12] P:1761.66 E:0.093228 |  Rebound, Fabian, first-time ball, finds Williams.
[2265.12 - 2268.32] P:1707.35 E:0.099992 |  Cucaraya has stayed out wide on the near side, links up with Williams.
[2268.32 - 2271.44] P:1684.32 E:0.102097 |  Left side of the penalty area now, seven minutes to go to half time.
[2271.44 - 2274.72] P:1718.13 E:0.094701 |  Cucaraya makes a darting run in from the left touch line.
[2274.72 - 2278.40] P:1578.35 E:0.098065 |  Williams though will run back in that space that Cucaraya has vacated.
[2278.40 - 2279.92] P:1414.00 E:0.110486 |  Williams still hasn't delivered the cross.
[2279.92 - 2282.64] P:1730.64 E:0.101484 |  Sane is back with him. Williams waiting.
[2284.00 - 2284.96] P:1748.43 E:0.111965 |  Rodgery helps out.
[2285.52 - 2288.00] P:1744.62 E:0.106562 |  Le Normand now forward of the centre circle,
[2288.00 - 2290.24] P:1819.98 E:0.092803 |  passes the ball out towards Fabian.
[2290.24 - 2291.68] P:1675.35 E:0.100808 |  Calvahal is on the inside of him.
[2291.68 - 2294.24] P:1711.03 E:0.085219 |  Here he is, touches the ball back to Fabian.
[2294.24 - 2297.44] P:1758.70 E:0.095495 |  Spain now is just starting to see a little bit more of the ball.
[2297.44 - 2301.68] P:1771.06 E:0.095454 |  They've only had 48% possession in this first half.
[2302.40 - 2305.60] P:1888.51 E:0.111439 |  As the Spanish supporters with the Olay, says Yomal.
[2306.24 - 2309.36] P:1860.51 E:0.114560 |  And those Olays are being drowned out by the whistles now
[2309.36 - 2311.84] P:1928.36 E:0.104751 |  of the Germany support here in Stuttgart.
[2311.84 - 2315.20] P:1916.53 E:0.097781 |  As the sun continues to shine, six minutes to go to the break.
[2315.20 - 2318.72] P:1845.61 E:0.102279 |  Williams keeps the ball in play, near side, up against Kimmich.
[2318.80 - 2321.04] P:1836.41 E:0.115413 |  Kimmich dives in and gets the challenge.
[2321.04 - 2324.08] P:1819.70 E:0.114607 |  Breaks towards Havertz. Kimmich's gone forward.
[2324.08 - 2327.84] P:1790.28 E:0.105884 |  Cucaraya though easily dispossesses Havertz.
[2327.84 - 2329.92] P:1884.59 E:0.102321 |  Olmo now is going to shape to shoot.
[2329.92 - 2332.16] P:1742.28 E:0.108304 |  Spilt by Neuer, comes out to Maratta.
[2332.16 - 2333.68] P:1752.68 E:0.104515 |  Can Maratta get a sight of goal?
[2333.68 - 2337.36] P:1730.75 E:0.105278 |  No, held up by Rudiger and then the rebound off the outstretch leg
[2337.36 - 2339.04] P:1797.13 E:0.104056 |  of Charlie is picked up by Neuer.
[2339.04 - 2343.68] P:1816.87 E:0.113571 |  It's a good hit, but Neuer's playing it back into the danger round here again.
[2343.68 - 2344.64] P:1553.92 E:0.105447 |  Again, we'll talk about that.
[2344.64 - 2348.56] P:1687.84 E:0.093074 |  He did it with Bayern Munich, very famous against Real Madrid.
[2348.56 - 2353.04] P:1605.44 E:0.096589 |  And this time, we're just seeing it again in Maratta's offside
[2353.04 - 2354.08] P:1585.61 E:0.105347 |  for the rebound.
[2354.08 - 2357.52] P:1589.64 E:0.094531 |  But if you're a goalkeeper, every goalkeeper tells me,
[2357.52 - 2360.24] P:1781.27 E:0.105314 |  when it's shot and you parry it to the side,
[2360.24 - 2361.52] P:1701.38 E:0.115424 |  not straight back to the danger.
[2363.28 - 2366.96] P:1822.68 E:0.117812 |  Actually, Mamadou Svili for Georgie did that with great effect
[2366.96 - 2369.52] P:1806.82 E:0.115148 |  the other night in Cologne with strong risks.
[2370.40 - 2374.56] P:1818.09 E:0.101691 |  As the ball has gone behind the advertising hoardings
[2374.64 - 2378.96] P:1671.13 E:0.087783 |  and it's taken a while for the ball boy or ball girl,
[2378.96 - 2382.16] P:1655.71 E:0.092099 |  it's so hard to see with that far away from the action
[2382.16 - 2384.88] P:1706.09 E:0.106925 |  in our commentary position here in the Stuttgart arena.
[2385.76 - 2391.60] P:1704.39 E:0.096881 |  But now with that throw, Moussiala finds round, cut out by Le Normand.
[2391.60 - 2393.92] P:1646.22 E:0.089042 |  Will lovely first touch by Olmo.
[2394.88 - 2396.16] P:1768.53 E:0.104501 |  Tar with the interception.
[2396.16 - 2398.08] P:1598.68 E:0.096913 |  There was Rodgery, Spain have it back,
[2398.08 - 2400.56] P:1757.53 E:0.086976 |  five minutes to go to halftime, 0-0.
[2400.56 - 2402.08] P:1627.19 E:0.103911 |  Along the ground towards Williams.
[2402.08 - 2403.28] P:1805.83 E:0.093085 |  Kymic was tight behind him.
[2404.00 - 2406.88] P:1705.59 E:0.093514 |  And Le Porte back in that central defensive area,
[2406.88 - 2409.92] P:1676.88 E:0.086003 |  squares it for his partner, Le Normand.
[2409.92 - 2412.80] P:1804.92 E:0.089089 |  Both of them French-born, Spanish internationals.
[2413.92 - 2416.00] P:1775.20 E:0.114912 |  0-0, five live and BBC sounds.
[2416.00 - 2418.32] P:1732.16 E:0.105315 |  Wimbledon coverage continues on Sports Extra.
[2420.72 - 2422.40] P:1840.17 E:0.125416 |  It's just classically one of those games here.
[2423.84 - 2424.80] P:1900.14 E:0.128928 |  People want to take chances,
[2424.80 - 2426.40] P:1647.80 E:0.111019 |  but they only want to do it in the final third.
[2427.44 - 2429.04] P:1786.19 E:0.108475 |  There is a fear, in fact, there isn't.
[2429.12 - 2432.32] P:1640.84 E:0.101079 |  They're playing around at the back, no one's over-risking it
[2432.32 - 2433.44] P:1735.25 E:0.098695 |  from the back line there.
[2434.88 - 2436.80] P:1516.34 E:0.105727 |  You understand that, because if you make a mistake
[2436.80 - 2438.24] P:1656.15 E:0.100090 |  in this game, you give a goal away.
[2438.24 - 2440.56] P:1637.07 E:0.105574 |  There's every likelihood the one may make more goals.
[2441.44 - 2444.32] P:1647.57 E:0.090281 |  I do understand there was a certain uncertainty
[2444.32 - 2445.20] P:1369.49 E:0.095646 |  with one or two players.
[2446.24 - 2448.88] P:1743.42 E:0.101471 |  Rodgery in between the two central defenders
[2448.88 - 2452.64] P:1884.57 E:0.090367 |  who've split quite wide, passes it to Le Porte.
[2452.64 - 2456.00] P:1819.48 E:0.106303 |  Oonoz-Simon hits it low, Olmo has made that run,
[2456.00 - 2457.36] P:1778.75 E:0.107422 |  being tracked by Croce.
[2457.84 - 2461.68] P:1794.35 E:0.101189 |  Oh, somebody's spoken out of turn here.
[2461.68 - 2464.32] P:1645.13 E:0.101820 |  Anthony Taylor is having a word with Chan.
[2465.28 - 2467.60] P:1782.71 E:0.105744 |  It was fortunate he should have been booked earlier,
[2467.60 - 2469.12] P:1733.27 E:0.095089 |  and that was a clear bit of dissent,
[2469.12 - 2470.72] P:1692.37 E:0.098658 |  the way that Anthony Taylor's reacted.
[2470.72 - 2474.24] P:1807.53 E:0.088189 |  And yet Chan once again escapes the booking.
[2474.24 - 2477.12] P:1677.58 E:0.117683 |  It's kind of been an unusual referee in my foot.
[2477.12 - 2478.96] P:1731.57 E:0.114904 |  Look, it's not always an easy game, the referee.
[2478.96 - 2481.20] P:1898.48 E:0.106729 |  The quality plus all chance.
[2481.20 - 2483.52] P:1868.33 E:0.105696 |  Kukere looking for the pace of Williams.
[2483.52 - 2485.12] P:1736.04 E:0.119209 |  I don't think it was offside that time.
[2485.60 - 2487.36] P:1872.88 E:0.115733 |  And just shows you the pace you've got.
[2487.36 - 2492.48] P:1806.08 E:0.099792 |  You turn off for a millisecond against any of the three off-world wingers
[2492.48 - 2494.08] P:1828.31 E:0.081286 |  that are on this pitch just now.
[2494.08 - 2494.80] P:1797.73 E:0.098074 |  And you're stuffing it.
[2494.80 - 2497.84] P:1686.48 E:0.102879 |  It shows you what a tough gig it is for everyone that he's fullbacks.
[2497.84 - 2501.76] P:1597.87 E:0.102635 |  Talk to Eluron about the battle between Zani and Kukere.
[2502.32 - 2504.96] P:1549.54 E:0.095065 |  Kukere has played it really well so far, hasn't he?
[2504.96 - 2507.44] P:1665.59 E:0.094369 |  In fact, he's pushed Zani back further and further
[2507.44 - 2510.88] P:1709.03 E:0.094869 |  in getting into dangerous positions themselves, the chance he'll play.
[2510.88 - 2511.60] P:1725.19 E:0.093624 |  I thought about you.
[2511.60 - 2514.80] P:1701.69 E:0.107075 |  I can't recall an opportunity for either Mussiala or Zani.
[2515.76 - 2519.20] P:1735.78 E:0.108618 |  Maratta coming deep, showed good strength to hold off the challenge of Havertz.
[2519.20 - 2521.36] P:1786.49 E:0.098647 |  Forward ball, though, cut out by Round.
[2521.36 - 2524.96] P:1785.71 E:0.095510 |  Just squeezed in a little bit there to the left back in the shadows now
[2525.84 - 2528.48] P:1687.88 E:0.104855 |  of the other son here with three minutes to go to halftime.
[2528.48 - 2531.52] P:1830.81 E:0.099789 |  This is their first meeting since a 1-1 draw in the group stages
[2531.52 - 2533.36] P:1731.88 E:0.082570 |  of the World Cup in Qatar.
[2533.92 - 2535.60] P:1693.71 E:0.100242 |  Both the goals came in the second half.
[2535.60 - 2538.24] P:1697.56 E:0.087337 |  Maratta just passed the hour and full crook
[2538.88 - 2541.60] P:1576.29 E:0.106274 |  with a late equaliser, seven minutes from the end.
[2542.56 - 2546.00] P:1623.94 E:0.110867 |  But there is Rudiger just putting his foot on the ball, nobody moving.
[2546.72 - 2547.92] P:1718.41 E:0.104938 |  And it's become that sort of...
[2547.92 - 2549.84] P:1629.38 E:0.106879 |  It's like becoming a game of chess in many ways.
[2549.84 - 2551.52] P:1551.61 E:0.119534 |  I think it shouldn't be a real surprise now.
[2551.52 - 2554.64] P:1558.40 E:0.097434 |  I mean, there are slightly different systems that they play.
[2554.64 - 2558.48] P:1623.49 E:0.105161 |  That every player after about 10 or 15 minutes knows where his problem is
[2558.48 - 2560.00] P:1664.15 E:0.098640 |  and who he should be marking.
[2560.00 - 2562.80] P:1670.33 E:0.103696 |  And they're trying to create a lot of chaos now in the Spanish.
[2563.44 - 2565.36] P:1655.06 E:0.110375 |  Roderick did well to get away from Chan.
[2565.36 - 2567.76] P:1631.22 E:0.105504 |  Fines Williams left-hand side, Williams with the cross,
[2567.76 - 2569.68] P:1697.97 E:0.099017 |  Noy has got it covered as it goes over his head.
[2570.32 - 2573.04] P:1645.91 E:0.108177 |  He was calm and relaxed, his arms were open wide.
[2573.04 - 2574.64] P:1905.05 E:0.102482 |  There was no threat to the Germany goal
[2574.64 - 2576.96] P:1766.24 E:0.095120 |  as it's gone out of play for a throw on that far side.
[2576.96 - 2580.08] P:1516.85 E:0.102489 |  I'm not about to shame that, because it always was Williams' problem.
[2580.08 - 2583.20] P:1596.23 E:0.090904 |  There has been over a few years that he's been around that.
[2583.20 - 2584.48] P:1422.43 E:0.089184 |  No problem beating Flitz.
[2584.48 - 2586.64] P:1548.54 E:0.093788 |  No problem getting to the baseline.
[2586.64 - 2589.12] P:1803.16 E:0.102760 |  Sometimes the choice when you actually get there
[2589.12 - 2591.28] P:1640.86 E:0.099059 |  hasn't been absolutely perfect though.
[2591.28 - 2596.56] P:1690.32 E:0.095472 |  And this tournament so far, he has scored one absolute stonker of a goal, hasn't he?
[2596.56 - 2597.92] P:1670.70 E:0.099870 |  Was that against Georgia?
[2597.92 - 2598.40] P:1451.81 E:0.085679 |  It was.
[2598.40 - 2599.52] P:1653.43 E:0.080407 |  Oh, what a goal.
[2599.52 - 2601.44] P:1847.52 E:0.096907 |  Yeah, it was a fine finish.
[2601.44 - 2604.16] P:1763.56 E:0.099352 |  It was his first goal for Spain
[2604.16 - 2606.08] P:1731.22 E:0.089903 |  since they played Georgia back in September.
[2606.08 - 2607.68] P:1678.17 E:0.096864 |  But it was only his third for his country.
[2608.32 - 2611.36] P:1742.07 E:0.106124 |  Tonight is his 18th appearance for the 21-year-old,
[2612.16 - 2616.00] P:1812.05 E:0.094904 |  who scored eight goals in 37 appearances for Athletic Bilbao.
[2617.12 - 2619.28] P:1857.14 E:0.101418 |  He's got just over 60 seconds remaining.
[2619.28 - 2622.72] P:1860.05 E:0.104419 |  It remains 0-0 on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[2624.72 - 2625.20] P:1755.05 E:0.123426 |  Laporte.
[2626.16 - 2626.88] P:1758.17 E:0.118846 |  Kukereya.
[2627.44 - 2629.92] P:1787.84 E:0.093743 |  Kymik closes him down, back with Laporte.
[2630.80 - 2633.28] P:1879.07 E:0.103957 |  Two former Manchester City players there coming together,
[2633.28 - 2634.32] P:1956.62 E:0.077853 |  Asane.
[2634.32 - 2637.04] P:1870.60 E:0.101885 |  She uses him, passes it all the way back to Unai Simon,
[2637.04 - 2638.64] P:1840.02 E:0.092862 |  and his dark goalkeeping outfit.
[2639.28 - 2643.20] P:1805.18 E:0.093684 |  Bright white gloves, strikes the ball long, right footed.
[2643.20 - 2644.88] P:1687.95 E:0.093812 |  Carvajal, flick header.
[2645.68 - 2648.48] P:1503.00 E:0.104517 |  La Minha Mal hooks it back then to Carvajal,
[2648.48 - 2650.56] P:1721.80 E:0.088270 |  and then helped out by Kroos.
[2650.56 - 2653.76] P:1721.05 E:0.109041 |  And Germany then give the ball away, straight towards Rodgerie.
[2653.76 - 2654.64] P:1858.44 E:0.101375 |  This is Fabian.
[2655.44 - 2657.76] P:1692.40 E:0.108790 |  Kukereya is getting forward to the feet of Marata,
[2657.76 - 2660.16] P:1698.37 E:0.103946 |  plays it out to the right-hand side of the penalty area.
[2660.16 - 2662.64] P:1539.27 E:0.106874 |  La Minha Mal, Williams is there as is Olmo,
[2662.64 - 2665.60] P:1769.11 E:0.106284 |  tussling for the ball, Mussi Arla on defensive duties,
[2665.60 - 2669.52] P:1848.79 E:0.107757 |  digs it out, and Germany should clear with 30 seconds remaining.
[2669.52 - 2670.08] P:1837.86 E:0.086931 |  Goalless.
[2670.08 - 2671.36] P:1677.75 E:0.108804 |  It was pretty good defending that,
[2671.36 - 2673.84] P:1387.92 E:0.114173 |  there was a lock going on off the ball there, wasn't there?
[2674.40 - 2676.40] P:1544.33 E:0.100819 |  I mean, I have to say, I'm impressed with Marata.
[2676.40 - 2679.28] P:1618.85 E:0.089597 |  He's kind of, he's got a lot stronger, hasn't he?
[2679.28 - 2682.48] P:1698.39 E:0.097263 |  He's taken on Rudiger, very physically there,
[2682.48 - 2683.68] P:1291.40 E:0.105483 |  and not many people do that.
[2683.68 - 2686.08] P:1607.88 E:0.089905 |  And he's not doing a bad job of it so far.
[2687.12 - 2690.72] P:1795.87 E:0.102646 |  He scored the first goal in this campaign against Croatia in Berlin.
[2690.72 - 2693.68] P:1856.13 E:0.104258 |  That was a sharp turn by La Minha Mal, who shoots,
[2693.68 - 2696.00] P:1813.40 E:0.105842 |  but it lacked the power really.
[2696.00 - 2698.80] P:1828.18 E:0.102367 |  It bounced into the arms of Neuer, and it was straight at,
[2698.80 - 2700.80] P:1724.18 E:0.099798 |  and the keeper didn't really have to move too much.
[2701.68 - 2705.12] P:1738.33 E:0.096641 |  There is something extra special about Yamal, isn't there?
[2706.56 - 2710.08] P:1736.82 E:0.094229 |  When he gets the ball, he just slips past plays with such pace.
[2710.08 - 2712.24] P:1618.67 E:0.102110 |  You know, he's very young, and he made the wrong choice there.
[2712.32 - 2714.96] P:1773.35 E:0.092925 |  He shoots from about 25 yards there.
[2714.96 - 2717.92] P:1670.81 E:0.090219 |  We're now in actual fact, he can take another five or six yards there,
[2717.92 - 2720.56] P:1686.28 E:0.097923 |  but why is he impressive when he's on the ball?
[2720.56 - 2722.80] P:1644.71 E:0.110691 |  Williams is now over on that far side, the right.
[2722.80 - 2726.40] P:1749.86 E:0.091921 |  We're into two minutes of added on time, five live and BBC sounds.
[2726.40 - 2729.92] P:1827.91 E:0.096975 |  Yamal still on that far side, Carvajal behind him.
[2730.72 - 2734.88] P:1930.09 E:0.104081 |  Carvajal to Yamal, forward, holding the whip, there's Williams.
[2734.88 - 2737.28] P:1887.22 E:0.102458 |  Carvajal's made a run into the penalty area.
[2737.28 - 2739.44] P:1895.03 E:0.089455 |  Rodgeri just outside the box.
[2739.44 - 2741.12] P:1727.31 E:0.105713 |  This is Leynor Mande.
[2741.12 - 2743.84] P:1737.50 E:0.101110 |  Leynor Mande, I thought he was going to shoot from distance.
[2743.84 - 2744.80] P:1729.50 E:0.117689 |  Here is Rodgeri.
[2744.80 - 2748.08] P:1735.99 E:0.109075 |  They don't score goals outside the box in the Euros.
[2748.08 - 2751.84] P:1744.21 E:0.092721 |  There was a great debate, that goal from Rodgeri,
[2751.84 - 2755.68] P:1724.54 E:0.102602 |  was it inside the area, was it outside the area against Georgia?
[2755.68 - 2757.68] P:1675.64 E:0.101974 |  Up to ruled, it was inside.
[2757.68 - 2761.44] P:1622.69 E:0.102903 |  It means that their last 59 goals at the Euros
[2761.44 - 2763.60] P:1675.70 E:0.103559 |  have all come inside the penalty area.
[2763.60 - 2767.12] P:1721.24 E:0.104030 |  As Carvajal now is forward, Olmo to Carvajal,
[2767.20 - 2771.44] P:1702.28 E:0.098865 |  cleared by a very compact and narrow back four by David Rao.
[2771.44 - 2773.12] P:1770.35 E:0.106357 |  Spain no win the ball back.
[2773.12 - 2776.08] P:1811.11 E:0.101090 |  Rodgeri, can they find a way through in stoppage time?
[2776.08 - 2777.92] P:1799.60 E:0.097836 |  Kroos stops the run of Morata.
[2777.92 - 2779.76] P:1789.93 E:0.108563 |  Kroos forward ball to Gundawan,
[2779.76 - 2782.88] P:1760.58 E:0.110395 |  coming together between Kukareya and Gundawan.
[2782.88 - 2784.16] P:1749.28 E:0.112082 |  Gundawan has stayed down.
[2784.16 - 2787.28] P:1702.99 E:0.105866 |  I think Anthony Taylor tried to let the game flow.
[2787.28 - 2789.68] P:1851.70 E:0.094222 |  He's brought it back for a Germany free kick.
[2789.68 - 2791.76] P:1702.62 E:0.110430 |  That's one of those ones where it's tough one now.
[2791.76 - 2793.28] P:1594.39 E:0.098393 |  It's a hard call for the referee,
[2793.28 - 2796.24] P:1752.87 E:0.097899 |  because I think Gundawan makes sure he leaves his leg
[2796.24 - 2797.84] P:1653.88 E:0.098412 |  and in place where the defender's coming.
[2797.84 - 2800.08] P:1684.87 E:0.086927 |  So, yeah, there is contact there.
[2800.08 - 2801.60] P:1701.57 E:0.071229 |  It is a free kick.
[2801.60 - 2803.12] P:1339.20 E:0.108996 |  I don't think it's a great deal more than that,
[2803.12 - 2804.96] P:1652.38 E:0.096960 |  because Gundawan knows what he's doing there.
[2807.44 - 2809.12] P:1691.51 E:0.106090 |  Johnny Stapman, Johnny Blaine,
[2809.12 - 2812.32] P:1598.76 E:0.096217 |  who is a friend of the Monday nightclub,
[2812.32 - 2814.72] P:1679.58 E:0.093254 |  often gets a mention from Mark Chapman.
[2814.72 - 2820.24] P:1673.40 E:0.091971 |  He verified for me that that goal from Rodgeri was inside the area.
[2821.28 - 2823.76] P:1725.07 E:0.086305 |  Chris Sutton was a little skeptical.
[2823.76 - 2825.76] P:1594.78 E:0.083617 |  I know it's not like Chris, I know.
[2825.76 - 2827.76] P:1864.76 E:0.099462 |  Here is Rodger, two to Kimmich.
[2827.76 - 2829.84] P:1873.43 E:0.103153 |  And there indeed is the halftime whistle.
[2829.84 - 2831.60] P:1854.07 E:0.115056 |  Spain nil, Germany nil. Pat Nevin.
[2832.40 - 2834.56] P:1698.76 E:0.122708 |  I mean, a very interesting game in many ways.
[2834.56 - 2838.16] P:1536.43 E:0.107966 |  And I think it probably would have kicked on going at a better pace.
[2838.16 - 2841.36] P:1454.19 E:0.108586 |  Had the injuries and the problems right at the start of the game,
[2841.36 - 2843.12] P:1645.08 E:0.109676 |  with the free kicks and the injuries
[2843.12 - 2845.52] P:1532.47 E:0.102617 |  and the referee making some unusual decisions.
[2845.52 - 2846.88] P:1493.48 E:0.110779 |  It kind of slowed it down a little bit,
[2846.88 - 2849.20] P:1495.68 E:0.103187 |  and as you say, it's become very, very tactical after that.
[2849.92 - 2854.08] P:1550.45 E:0.106652 |  I think maybe the Spaniards are just nudging it with chances
[2854.08 - 2855.92] P:1407.68 E:0.099810 |  and looking slightly more dangerous.
[2855.92 - 2858.24] P:1429.51 E:0.106812 |  But there's so little in it, and you just know
[2858.24 - 2861.28] P:1408.35 E:0.097100 |  it's going to come down in one piece of absolute brilliance.
[2861.28 - 2864.32] P:1668.41 E:0.100416 |  The problem is, I guess, who that absolute brilliance is going to come from.
[2864.32 - 2867.84] P:1493.61 E:0.103145 |  Because there's so many capable of it in this field at the moment.
[2867.84 - 2872.72] P:1488.21 E:0.095079 |  But at the moment, not completely taken off yet, but a very intriguing game.
[2872.72 - 2874.72] P:1677.70 E:0.094217 |  And in this heavyweight contest,
[2874.72 - 2878.32] P:1651.77 E:0.095556 |  no side has managed to land a knockout blow just as yet.
[2878.32 - 2880.64] P:1770.30 E:0.110973 |  Halftime then, Spain nil, Germany nil.
[2881.20 - 2882.72] P:1594.52 E:0.114087 |  And Kelly, you're in Hamburg.
[2883.52 - 2885.92] P:1543.07 E:0.100108 |  I am indeed, yes, Ian Denison, Pat Nevin,
[2885.92 - 2888.48] P:1618.52 E:0.106485 |  bringing us that game between Spain and Germany.
[2888.48 - 2892.16] P:1738.36 E:0.085692 |  And Pat, for two teams, you've got so much talent on display.
[2892.16 - 2894.96] P:1518.72 E:0.087224 |  It's been pretty scrappy for the first 45 minutes.
[2895.76 - 2897.60] P:1675.11 E:0.114831 |  I think that was understandable from the Germans,
[2897.60 - 2899.12] P:1579.70 E:0.116063 |  because I think they realised early on
[2899.12 - 2901.12] P:1546.92 E:0.093232 |  that the sprightliness of the Spanish
[2901.12 - 2902.72] P:1553.37 E:0.100102 |  was going to cause them all sorts of problems.
[2903.28 - 2907.28] P:1729.83 E:0.100337 |  So there was a few hefty hits early on in the game.
[2907.28 - 2910.16] P:1588.41 E:0.099929 |  And I kind of made it a little bit bitty for a little bit too long.
[2910.16 - 2912.40] P:1534.76 E:0.101797 |  And you understand why the Germans are going to do that,
[2912.40 - 2915.60] P:1740.03 E:0.091724 |  because if they stand up and just play an open game,
[2915.60 - 2918.08] P:1624.15 E:0.083404 |  I think the Spanish probably will win this one.
[2918.08 - 2922.64] P:1594.42 E:0.097246 |  Because of the like, and the Nicol Williams and Jamal out in the wide areas,
[2922.64 - 2923.84] P:1592.97 E:0.103617 |  they just look fabulous.
[2923.84 - 2926.08] P:1667.74 E:0.094489 |  So, you know, understand why that happened,
[2926.08 - 2927.52] P:1328.59 E:0.098177 |  but you know, the game will open up.
[2927.52 - 2929.52] P:1575.79 E:0.088239 |  It's a very steamy atmosphere here.
[2929.52 - 2931.92] P:1494.42 E:0.096321 |  And because of that, one or two players get tired,
[2931.92 - 2933.20] P:1581.69 E:0.095679 |  a little bit of space will open up.
[2933.20 - 2936.32] P:1664.61 E:0.084303 |  And whether it will happen in the next 45,
[2936.32 - 2939.04] P:1460.43 E:0.105252 |  or indeed possibly the 30 after that, I don't know.
[2939.04 - 2941.84] P:1537.07 E:0.093786 |  But at some point, some of those players will get opportunities.
[2942.64 - 2945.36] P:1617.48 E:0.105708 |  Whenever it happens, and whichever side goes through,
[2945.36 - 2947.76] P:1491.51 E:0.094141 |  there could be players missing for either side,
[2947.76 - 2949.28] P:1585.51 E:0.087366 |  with the injury to Pedri,
[2949.28 - 2952.16] P:1481.56 E:0.100112 |  and with suspensions from players picking up yellow cards today.
[2952.96 - 2955.44] P:1541.90 E:0.110007 |  Yeah, Rodrigo's going to miss it. That's a massive one.
[2956.16 - 2959.68] P:1587.51 E:0.101862 |  He was obviously quite affected by that for about 10 or 15 minutes afterwards,
[2959.68 - 2962.32] P:1678.82 E:0.098153 |  because he wasn't going into any tackles.
[2962.32 - 2963.84] P:1404.94 E:0.103820 |  He was kind of holding off a little bit,
[2963.84 - 2966.16] P:1663.68 E:0.089304 |  obviously worried about being sent off in this game.
[2966.16 - 2967.68] P:1521.38 E:0.104788 |  But he's going to miss the next one.
[2967.68 - 2970.88] P:1548.21 E:0.104392 |  And he has been really core of that defence for quite some time now.
[2971.52 - 2974.32] P:1808.96 E:0.100688 |  Limitly, Norman, he needs to get his head together,
[2974.32 - 2977.60] P:1566.30 E:0.096362 |  because as far as I'm concerned, he's been booked for doing nothing wrong.
[2978.24 - 2981.28] P:1753.86 E:0.103924 |  And that's hard to take, knowing that if your team goes through,
[2981.28 - 2983.44] P:1612.37 E:0.090346 |  you've got a semi-final coming up,
[2983.44 - 2985.20] P:1619.77 E:0.111443 |  and you're not going to be able to play in it
[2985.20 - 2988.80] P:1619.75 E:0.097693 |  because of what was a very unusual decision by the referee.
[2988.80 - 2990.08] P:1561.99 E:0.090747 |  That's a tough line to take.
[2990.08 - 2992.00] P:1535.74 E:0.096700 |  But hey, that's tournament football.
[2992.00 - 2993.60] P:1390.40 E:0.104900 |  They go on with it, they deal with it,
[2994.56 - 2995.84] P:1539.00 E:0.108599 |  and they'll put it to the back of their minds.
[2995.84 - 2997.36] P:1759.06 E:0.087283 |  But you're absolutely right.
[2997.36 - 3000.56] P:1621.32 E:0.092150 |  It's not been the explosive game we
[3000.64 - 3002.32] P:1544.79 E:0.082057 |  hope for so far.
[3002.32 - 3004.00] P:1219.64 E:0.101228 |  But that doesn't mean it's not going to happen.
[3004.00 - 3005.44] P:1515.54 E:0.102618 |  I mean, I really do expect it will.
[3005.44 - 3007.92] P:1576.04 E:0.089704 |  And if any team scores early in the second half,
[3007.92 - 3009.92] P:1551.55 E:0.087680 |  I'm sure we'll have a cracker start to come.
[3009.92 - 3011.84] P:1428.89 E:0.106577 |  And Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis will bring you
[3011.84 - 3015.04] P:1584.41 E:0.089906 |  second half commentary from Stuttgart of Spain against Germany,
[3015.04 - 3017.12] P:1796.46 E:0.090270 |  nil nil there at halftime.
[3017.12 - 3018.96] P:1732.81 E:0.093787 |  As you said, we are here,
[3018.96 - 3023.20] P:1742.81 E:0.090461 |  and we are in Hamburg ahead of the late kickoff this evening.
[3023.20 - 3025.44] P:1707.16 E:0.092702 |  It's eight o'clock here in Hamburg,
[3025.44 - 3029.52] P:1862.23 E:0.084423 |  and we'll be bringing you coverage of what could be quite a tight game
[3029.52 - 3031.28] P:1728.73 E:0.088827 |  between Portugal and France.
[3031.28 - 3032.88] P:1611.59 E:0.085216 |  We'll have some build-up to that coming up.
[3032.88 - 3035.92] P:1745.34 E:0.096493 |  We'll also get the very latest from a busy day at Wimbledon
[3035.92 - 3037.76] P:1723.84 E:0.071057 |  after the BBC News with Richard Foster.
[3038.64 - 3040.24] P:1262.01 E:0.155097 |  The Voice of the UK.
[3040.24 - 3043.12] P:1320.43 E:0.125141 |  And the home of the Euros and Wimbledon.
[3043.12 - 3045.60] P:1520.03 E:0.118879 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3046.24 - 3047.20] P:1578.12 E:0.116640 |  Thanks, Kelly. Good evening.
[3047.20 - 3050.48] P:1903.11 E:0.103283 |  Rachel Reeves has become Britain's first ever female chancellor,
[3050.48 - 3052.96] P:2042.49 E:0.083540 |  as Secure Sturma names his first cabinet
[3052.96 - 3055.12] P:1784.22 E:0.093406 |  after Labour's landslide election victory.
[3055.12 - 3056.64] P:1859.00 E:0.095497 |  She's been speaking at the Treasury
[3056.64 - 3059.36] P:1677.87 E:0.079122 |  and told staff she's aware of the challenges of the job.
[3059.52 - 3061.76] P:1282.10 E:0.077693 |  It comes with a great weight of responsibility.
[3062.80 - 3063.76] P:1017.40 E:0.066036 |  I embrace it.
[3064.72 - 3066.16] P:917.43 E:0.087924 |  It will demand hard work.
[3067.28 - 3068.32] P:876.35 E:0.058681 |  I am ready for it.
[3069.20 - 3072.00] P:1204.66 E:0.080170 |  The British people have put their trust in this new government.
[3072.72 - 3075.76] P:824.32 E:0.059354 |  They've put their trust in us to run the economy
[3075.76 - 3077.44] P:993.79 E:0.062014 |  and to protect their finances.
[3078.08 - 3080.80] P:1240.84 E:0.055492 |  And that trust must not be squandered.
[3080.80 - 3083.04] P:1605.03 E:0.082156 |  Angela Reina has been named Deputy Prime Minister.
[3083.04 - 3084.96] P:1838.20 E:0.098929 |  John Healy is the Defence Secretary,
[3084.96 - 3088.40] P:1767.58 E:0.088647 |  and Pat McFadden has been appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
[3088.40 - 3090.16] P:1866.76 E:0.090994 |  Evette Cooper is the new Home Secretary.
[3090.16 - 3093.20] P:1893.52 E:0.081120 |  She's been outlining her priorities outside the Home Office.
[3093.20 - 3096.72] P:1596.27 E:0.064482 |  Trying to get neighbourhood police back on our streets in our communities
[3096.72 - 3100.16] P:1638.82 E:0.093466 |  and also setting up the new Border Security Command
[3100.16 - 3102.16] P:1652.05 E:0.071405 |  to go after the criminal boat gangs
[3102.16 - 3105.36] P:1416.57 E:0.080697 |  that are organising the dangerous boat crossings.
[3105.36 - 3110.32] P:1662.60 E:0.087122 |  Our communities have faced damage and often felt fractured
[3110.32 - 3112.32] P:1594.83 E:0.083432 |  and sometimes brittle as well.
[3112.32 - 3115.68] P:1521.51 E:0.076550 |  And our task has to be to bring people back together.
[3115.68 - 3117.60] P:1776.93 E:0.101590 |  David Lamme is the new Foreign Secretary
[3117.92 - 3120.00] P:1936.15 E:0.100731 |  and says everyone wants to see an immediate ceasefire
[3120.00 - 3121.52] P:1776.78 E:0.086801 |  between Israel and Hamas.
[3121.52 - 3123.68] P:1826.63 E:0.095108 |  He says he'll do all he can diplomatically
[3123.68 - 3126.72] P:1708.15 E:0.072579 |  to support Joe Biden in bringing about that ceasefire.
[3126.72 - 3128.80] P:1830.46 E:0.089132 |  And he's been setting out his key aims in government.
[3129.36 - 3132.64] P:1002.85 E:0.073565 |  I want to see a reset on Europe,
[3132.64 - 3136.24] P:1455.09 E:0.086994 |  a reset on our relationships with the Global South
[3136.24 - 3138.00] P:1101.35 E:0.084333 |  and a reset on climate.
[3138.56 - 3140.64] P:1497.68 E:0.079111 |  And I also want to see some gear shifts.
[3140.64 - 3144.56] P:1722.44 E:0.070887 |  Gear shifts on European security and on global security,
[3144.56 - 3147.36] P:811.74 E:0.083157 |  given all the problems that we're seeing in the Middle East,
[3147.44 - 3151.36] P:1245.05 E:0.083432 |  but also I want to centre our foreign policy on British growth.
[3151.36 - 3153.44] P:1764.51 E:0.093075 |  In the past few minutes, Lisa Nandi has been promoted
[3153.44 - 3156.16] P:1905.09 E:0.087134 |  to Culture Secretary and Secure Starmer's top team
[3156.16 - 3158.72] P:1704.51 E:0.092817 |  after the previous holder of the brief, Thangam Debenair,
[3158.72 - 3160.56] P:1953.02 E:0.058417 |  lost her seat to the Greens.
[3160.56 - 3162.32] P:1968.29 E:0.102060 |  Reform UK have won another seat.
[3162.32 - 3165.92] P:1905.70 E:0.081578 |  They've just taken Basildon South and East Thuruk from the Conservatives,
[3165.92 - 3169.12] P:1895.40 E:0.084724 |  with a majority of just 98 votes over the Labour candidate.
[3169.12 - 3171.20] P:1974.96 E:0.077157 |  It takes reforms total to five seats,
[3171.20 - 3174.24] P:1992.67 E:0.083943 |  despite securing more than 14% of the vote share.
[3174.24 - 3176.80] P:1830.93 E:0.095906 |  Earlier, Nigel Farage was heckled at a news conference
[3176.80 - 3179.44] P:1924.99 E:0.079780 |  but said he'd campaigned for changes to the electoral system.
[3180.00 - 3182.00] P:1564.59 E:0.084914 |  If we had proportional representation,
[3182.00 - 3184.32] P:1900.89 E:0.060958 |  we'd be looking at nearly 100 seats.
[3184.32 - 3187.44] P:1752.33 E:0.077782 |  But equally, First Pass the Post inverts the other way.
[3188.00 - 3191.12] P:1714.33 E:0.050286 |  Where Labour get fewer votes, they got under Corbyn,
[3191.12 - 3192.96] P:1652.38 E:0.063067 |  and yet 200 more seats.
[3192.96 - 3198.24] P:1815.41 E:0.066259 |  It is very much my view that our outdated First Pass the Post electoral system
[3198.24 - 3200.72] P:1979.21 E:0.070204 |  is not fit for purpose,
[3200.72 - 3204.08] P:1533.75 E:0.061378 |  and we will campaign with anyone and everyone
[3204.08 - 3206.32] P:1868.79 E:0.053828 |  to change this electoral system.
[3206.32 - 3208.72] P:1628.02 E:0.092598 |  The Conservatives had their worst election result ever,
[3208.72 - 3210.40] P:1463.81 E:0.110789 |  and we're now looking for a new leader,
[3210.40 - 3212.56] P:1982.65 E:0.084602 |  after Rishi Sunak announced his resignation.
[3212.56 - 3216.00] P:1790.86 E:0.081601 |  He'll step down once the process of choosing a successor begins,
[3216.00 - 3218.16] P:1742.92 E:0.088632 |  and says he's heard the anger of the people.
[3218.16 - 3221.60] P:1785.53 E:0.089088 |  Dame Eleanor Lang is the former Conservative MP for Epping Forest.
[3221.60 - 3225.44] P:1953.82 E:0.077928 |  She told Five Live the Tories' next leader must have serious substance.
[3225.44 - 3230.16] P:2185.25 E:0.076198 |  There's been far too much discussion of late about trivia,
[3230.16 - 3231.92] P:2093.91 E:0.063012 |  instead of about principles.
[3231.92 - 3235.92] P:2093.31 E:0.073475 |  There has also been far too much talk about personalities.
[3235.92 - 3237.36] P:2150.48 E:0.054837 |  It isn't a game show.
[3237.36 - 3241.20] P:2058.91 E:0.079366 |  It's about people's lives, and it's about the future of this country.
[3241.20 - 3245.28] P:1868.97 E:0.084142 |  We have to have a leader who will have decent, honest,
[3245.28 - 3248.08] P:2001.25 E:0.083191 |  straightforward arguments with Keir Starmer.
[3248.08 - 3250.00] P:1377.99 E:0.058201 |  The Liberal Democrats will return to government
[3250.00 - 3253.28] P:1790.43 E:0.085964 |  at the third largest party in Parliament, with 71 seats.
[3253.28 - 3255.52] P:1738.47 E:0.095350 |  The party took the seats of two former Prime Ministers,
[3255.52 - 3257.44] P:1762.70 E:0.065056 |  David Cameron and Theresa May.
[3257.44 - 3259.52] P:1833.90 E:0.106814 |  And in Wales, almost all the seats went to Labour,
[3259.52 - 3261.92] P:1663.85 E:0.086163 |  leaving the Tories with no MPs at all there.
[3261.92 - 3264.88] P:1965.47 E:0.080213 |  In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin has the most seats in Westminster,
[3264.88 - 3267.12] P:1800.33 E:0.071895 |  while the DUP lost three MPs.
[3268.32 - 3271.04] P:1256.13 E:0.120579 |  In the latest travel news, on the road to Ingrate Manchester,
[3271.04 - 3274.00] P:1206.22 E:0.103488 |  the M60 clockwise, one lane is closed at the moment,
[3274.00 - 3277.28] P:1413.92 E:0.099946 |  between Junction 13 at Wersley and the Swinton interchange.
[3277.28 - 3280.48] P:1342.42 E:0.097911 |  It's broken down vehicle, they're very heavy traffic, so expect delays.
[3280.48 - 3286.32] P:1257.33 E:0.100321 |  The M25 anticlockwise, two lanes are closed between Junction 17 and 16 at the M40.
[3286.32 - 3287.44] P:1508.49 E:0.089234 |  There's been an accident.
[3287.44 - 3289.60] P:1413.65 E:0.088827 |  Traffic is queuing as you approach that closure.
[3289.60 - 3292.08] P:1207.87 E:0.098986 |  Really long delays already, so it is going to be slow.
[3292.08 - 3296.00] P:1419.88 E:0.100133 |  And the M23 southbound, the exit slip road is partially blocked
[3296.00 - 3298.00] P:1398.39 E:0.089757 |  at Junction 11 at Pease Potage.
[3298.00 - 3300.64] P:1376.20 E:0.096043 |  That is causing a bit of a back up onto the main carriageway.
[3300.64 - 3303.92] P:1255.21 E:0.092157 |  It's a broken down lorry, so it's going to take a little while for that to clear.
[3303.92 - 3305.28] P:1268.34 E:0.095351 |  Ellie Brennan, five live travel.
[3323.04 - 3327.28] P:1649.61 E:0.125281 |  This is Five Live Sports with Kelly Kitts.
[3327.28 - 3329.44] P:1437.69 E:0.119952 |  Euro 2024, Deutschland.
[3330.64 - 3335.04] P:1858.10 E:0.099087 |  We're in Hamburg this evening for the eight o'clock kickoff between Portugal and France
[3335.04 - 3337.76] P:1954.64 E:0.086425 |  in the quarterfinals of Euro 24.
[3337.76 - 3342.72] P:1994.85 E:0.083059 |  Before that, we'll be back to Stuttgart for the second half of Spain against Germany.
[3342.72 - 3345.68] P:1933.11 E:0.080041 |  That one is nil nil at half time.
[3345.68 - 3348.72] P:1751.27 E:0.087951 |  And our coverage of Wimbledon continues on SportsAxtra.
[3348.72 - 3350.16] P:1673.69 E:0.098483 |  Let's head there now for an update.
[3350.24 - 3354.80] P:1873.06 E:0.080784 |  Ian Carter is on centre court, where reigning men's champion, Carlos Alcarath,
[3354.80 - 3358.00] P:1942.61 E:0.081440 |  had a titanic battle with Francis Tiafoeian.
[3358.00 - 3359.04] P:2088.66 E:0.085408 |  He really did.
[3359.04 - 3362.40] P:1983.02 E:0.086654 |  Tiafoe provided just so much energy.
[3362.40 - 3366.64] P:1974.06 E:0.082867 |  He really stretched to Alcarath, who wasn't at his absolute best.
[3366.64 - 3371.76] P:1725.15 E:0.095501 |  He dropped the first set, seven-five, hit back, taking the second by six games to two.
[3371.76 - 3377.44] P:1773.89 E:0.091910 |  But Tiafoe came back, he took the third, six-four, and the fourth went all the way to a tie break.
[3377.44 - 3381.12] P:1917.26 E:0.085292 |  So there was real concern as far as Alcarath was concerned.
[3381.12 - 3386.08] P:1943.06 E:0.079969 |  But he came through the breaker and then really up to gear in the final set
[3386.08 - 3388.32] P:1976.28 E:0.068182 |  to take that by six games to two.
[3388.32 - 3391.44] P:1756.67 E:0.089231 |  And as a result, takes his place in the last 16.
[3391.44 - 3394.56] P:1854.53 E:0.081132 |  But a real scare for Alcarath, no doubt about it.
[3394.56 - 3395.44] P:1913.05 E:0.018978 |  Kelly.
[3395.44 - 3400.40] P:1843.27 E:0.092386 |  2013 Wimbledon champion, Marion Bartley is alongside Ian at Wimbledon.
[3400.40 - 3402.64] P:1764.93 E:0.086318 |  Marion, how would you sum up that encounter?
[3408.40 - 3412.48] P:1675.35 E:0.118470 |  We will get to hear what Marion Bartley made of that very shortly.
[3412.48 - 3416.24] P:1641.23 E:0.083748 |  Once we've got the more technical details sorted out, in the meantime,
[3416.24 - 3421.04] P:1879.86 E:0.086753 |  we can hear about Britain's Sonny Cartel, who's in action on court one against Coco Goff.
[3421.04 - 3422.64] P:1981.34 E:0.085524 |  Maz Veroucchi is watching this one.
[3422.64 - 3423.36] P:1578.45 E:0.077542 |  Maz.
[3423.36 - 3424.48] P:1779.19 E:0.099490 |  Hello Kelly, yes.
[3424.48 - 3429.12] P:1745.81 E:0.109044 |  Coco Goff serving for the first set, leading five-four.
[3429.12 - 3433.44] P:1653.86 E:0.095355 |  She has just broken Sonny Cartel in the previous game of this first set.
[3433.44 - 3436.16] P:1779.47 E:0.098093 |  But Sonny Cartel doing really well, I think, given the occasion,
[3436.16 - 3438.88] P:1828.64 E:0.091329 |  the fact she's playing in this arena at court one,
[3438.88 - 3443.60] P:1987.16 E:0.095663 |  and given the huge opponent she's facing over the net in the number two C, Coco Goff,
[3443.60 - 3446.96] P:1779.88 E:0.089781 |  she has rallied after conceding a break early on in the first set.
[3446.96 - 3450.56] P:1811.60 E:0.088215 |  And then she had two break-back points of her own in the eighth game of the first set,
[3450.56 - 3455.04] P:1632.22 E:0.085947 |  was able to take advantage of the second one of those with Goff serving a double fault,
[3455.04 - 3460.08] P:1768.49 E:0.089555 |  but then immediately was broken then in the next game by the US Open champion.
[3460.08 - 3464.40] P:1818.37 E:0.085669 |  So Coco Goff serving here at 30 Love in this first set,
[3464.40 - 3467.20] P:1422.90 E:0.076715 |  to take this first set six games to four.
[3467.20 - 3471.12] P:1553.91 E:0.103864 |  So a couple of points away, but Sonny Cartel with a wonderful four-hand winner there.
[3471.12 - 3473.04] P:1796.93 E:0.103656 |  So she's really rising to the occasion there.
[3473.04 - 3476.32] P:1770.81 E:0.092503 |  Obviously the challenge of facing Coco Goff is a huge one,
[3476.32 - 3479.12] P:1776.09 E:0.099765 |  but she's not letting the occasion overawar her at the moment.
[3479.76 - 3481.36] P:1666.87 E:0.107103 |  Maz, for now, thank you very much.
[3481.36 - 3485.04] P:1822.21 E:0.100346 |  Ian, back to you, because Emma Radhikhanu is in action against Maria Sakari.
[3486.80 - 3491.92] P:1873.62 E:0.087611 |  Yes, Emma Radhikhanu now has got the early break of serve here
[3491.92 - 3498.96] P:1897.02 E:0.087876 |  against Maria Sakari, but she is under a little bit of pressure here at 15-30
[3498.96 - 3500.72] P:2029.82 E:0.087861 |  in her initial service game.
[3500.72 - 3504.56] P:1807.22 E:0.082939 |  Of course Radhikhanu is looking to build on what was a brilliant performance
[3504.56 - 3505.68] P:1627.78 E:0.101480 |  in the second round.
[3506.32 - 3509.44] P:1735.18 E:0.099094 |  She knows about Sakari in a grand slam environment,
[3509.44 - 3512.96] P:1803.29 E:0.091954 |  because she beat her in the semi-finals in the US Open
[3513.76 - 3516.00] P:1857.14 E:0.092851 |  when she won that a couple of years ago.
[3516.00 - 3517.60] P:1793.53 E:0.099586 |  So the Omens are good.
[3517.60 - 3520.96] P:1829.90 E:0.086222 |  It's a fairly sparsely populated centre court right now.
[3520.96 - 3524.64] P:1823.50 E:0.081892 |  People catching their breath after Al-Qurraf, but this will fill up,
[3524.64 - 3528.80] P:1787.23 E:0.083330 |  and I'm sure we'll turn into a real cauldron as this match continues.
[3529.76 - 3532.32] P:1746.19 E:0.105570 |  Ian, we are going to try and talk to Marian now.
[3532.32 - 3535.20] P:2111.98 E:0.105690 |  Hopefully, Marian, you can hear me, and I can hear you.
[3535.76 - 3538.00] P:1837.02 E:0.088740 |  It's all working perfectly now.
[3538.00 - 3540.96] P:1791.10 E:0.088138 |  Look, French Open finalist Jasmine Paulini is through to the fourth round
[3540.96 - 3546.08] P:1744.06 E:0.099527 |  for the first time at SW 19, but she's up against Madison Keyes next.
[3547.20 - 3549.68] P:1787.38 E:0.095322 |  Well, Jasmine Paulini has been really surprising
[3549.76 - 3551.20] P:1696.23 E:0.077744 |  since the beginning of the season.
[3551.20 - 3556.08] P:1903.90 E:0.082505 |  She never passed any more than the second round at any grand slam she played
[3556.64 - 3560.64] P:1878.72 E:0.075842 |  since the beginning of her career, until the Australian Open this year,
[3560.64 - 3562.64] P:1938.99 E:0.076367 |  when she started to reach the round of 16,
[3562.64 - 3565.84] P:1968.63 E:0.088012 |  and then she back it up with that beautiful and amazing run
[3565.84 - 3568.16] P:1790.85 E:0.090244 |  of wrong arrows when she conquered so many hearts
[3568.16 - 3569.92] P:1780.53 E:0.072067 |  with that beautiful smile on the court.
[3569.92 - 3572.40] P:1962.78 E:0.085208 |  Today she had a great victory over Bianca Andrescu,
[3572.40 - 3576.88] P:1813.53 E:0.076458 |  a former US Open champion as well herself, 7-6-6-1, very convincing,
[3576.88 - 3578.72] P:1764.18 E:0.087163 |  but she's up against Madison Keyes, Katie,
[3578.72 - 3581.44] P:1687.95 E:0.109146 |  and Madison Keyes is having a lot of firepower,
[3581.44 - 3583.92] P:1752.46 E:0.097578 |  and on the grush, she has proven over the years
[3583.92 - 3587.12] P:1811.75 E:0.080469 |  that that firepower can be extremely dangerous and hard to handle.
[3587.12 - 3590.56] P:1852.57 E:0.068699 |  So we will be in for a very tight contest between those two players.
[3590.56 - 3592.48] P:1801.06 E:0.087468 |  They're very close in terms of the ranking as well,
[3592.48 - 3595.60] P:1859.80 E:0.063836 |  so it's getting very interesting here at SW 19.
[3596.80 - 3598.80] P:1964.23 E:0.111827 |  Marian, lovely to talk to you eventually.
[3598.80 - 3602.16] P:1918.90 E:0.096439 |  Thank you very much to Marian Bartley, Hunter Ian Carter,
[3602.16 - 3603.68] P:1789.46 E:0.095202 |  and of course to Mars Ferooki.
[3603.68 - 3605.20] P:1723.01 E:0.084814 |  And remember that you can keep up to date
[3605.20 - 3607.12] P:1651.53 E:0.082465 |  with everything that's happening at Wimbledon
[3607.12 - 3609.36] P:1907.46 E:0.087447 |  as coverage continues on Sports Extra.
[3609.36 - 3612.56] P:1702.33 E:0.090917 |  We will have regular updates here on Five Lives Sport.
[3612.56 - 3614.32] P:1971.86 E:0.090622 |  We'll be back to Stuttgart very soon
[3614.32 - 3618.32] P:1923.57 E:0.085453 |  for second half commentary of that game between Spain and Germany,
[3618.32 - 3622.16] P:1944.93 E:0.076659 |  and then at eight o'clock this evening in Hamburg,
[3622.16 - 3624.00] P:1790.24 E:0.073815 |  it's Portugal against France,
[3624.00 - 3626.72] P:1782.96 E:0.083313 |  Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton will be your commentary team.
[3627.44 - 3630.56] P:1888.06 E:0.092741 |  Ali, it's a repeat of the 2016 Euros final,
[3630.56 - 3633.04] P:1963.91 E:0.077869 |  but much has changed since then.
[3633.04 - 3635.92] P:1895.19 E:0.079091 |  It's just a marker rather than a predictor.
[3635.92 - 3638.16] P:1936.59 E:0.097778 |  I mean, are we actually calling it Portugal, France,
[3638.16 - 3639.28] P:2101.67 E:0.087953 |  or are we just cutting to the chase
[3639.28 - 3641.52] P:1883.80 E:0.092840 |  and going straight to Ronaldo against Mbappe?
[3642.88 - 3644.80] P:1854.72 E:0.087341 |  Okay, let's start with the headline
[3644.80 - 3646.32] P:1874.73 E:0.086382 |  and then work our way into the details.
[3646.32 - 3648.64] P:2036.49 E:0.101125 |  I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek, actually, Kelly,
[3648.64 - 3650.64] P:1940.73 E:0.088704 |  because it is an obvious narrative.
[3650.64 - 3652.40] P:2016.36 E:0.088910 |  It is going to be a massive feature of tonight's game.
[3652.40 - 3655.60] P:2103.49 E:0.088057 |  And actually, I think both nations really need their star men
[3655.60 - 3657.20] P:1983.05 E:0.080343 |  to help them find a creative spark.
[3657.20 - 3659.28] P:1993.90 E:0.089713 |  I was saying to Chris yesterday, we're having a coffee in Berlin,
[3659.28 - 3662.72] P:1959.41 E:0.076064 |  I felt both teams have become a little constipated at this tournament.
[3663.60 - 3666.48] P:1959.82 E:0.079499 |  We have some great conversations, don't we?
[3667.76 - 3670.40] P:1902.39 E:0.096816 |  Genuinely, you two are spending far too much time together.
[3670.40 - 3674.00] P:1917.77 E:0.082005 |  Sometimes thoughts can stay inside your head, Ali,
[3674.00 - 3677.04] P:1788.91 E:0.101672 |  but there has been an issue with both these sides scoring.
[3677.68 - 3678.40] P:1748.61 E:0.096619 |  Yes, there has.
[3678.40 - 3681.04] P:1854.95 E:0.090939 |  And let's hope this is the evening
[3681.04 - 3685.20] P:1851.20 E:0.079445 |  when both teams really come to life in this competition.
[3685.20 - 3689.12] P:1718.47 E:0.087307 |  France, I mean, they always seem to go into tournament football
[3689.12 - 3690.24] P:2013.02 E:0.086878 |  and just do enough.
[3690.24 - 3692.64] P:1883.39 E:0.080123 |  So this is maybe when they can get going.
[3693.44 - 3696.48] P:1810.02 E:0.075783 |  And Portugal, everybody talks about Ronaldo.
[3696.48 - 3699.52] P:1800.67 E:0.082181 |  I wonder whether he is part of the problem,
[3699.52 - 3703.44] P:1878.76 E:0.084405 |  the fact that at the ripe old age of what is he, 39 now,
[3704.00 - 3708.32] P:1912.43 E:0.073708 |  that the team are always looking for him in an attacking sense.
[3709.60 - 3712.72] P:1980.73 E:0.071598 |  But they've got so many quality players through their side.
[3712.72 - 3717.44] P:1830.18 E:0.078871 |  Bruno Fernandez, Bernardo Silva, they are a talented lot.
[3717.44 - 3721.60] P:1926.79 E:0.075015 |  And it's an interesting game, difficult one to call.
[3721.68 - 3725.12] P:1955.99 E:0.064495 |  I just think that France eventually will click
[3725.12 - 3727.20] P:1765.28 E:0.080333 |  and Bapé hasn't really hit the heights.
[3727.20 - 3728.80] P:1875.47 E:0.077533 |  We know that he's capable of.
[3728.80 - 3730.72] P:1717.91 E:0.063498 |  So maybe this is the evening when it happens.
[3730.72 - 3733.12] P:1792.47 E:0.094316 |  Let's head back to Wimbledon and Masferuki.
[3733.12 - 3736.08] P:1674.98 E:0.092999 |  What rallies these two players are constructing here on court?
[3736.08 - 3738.16] P:1673.97 E:0.093946 |  One, exchanging ground strokes from the baseline,
[3738.16 - 3739.84] P:1439.92 E:0.097732 |  but the World Number Two, Coco Goff,
[3739.84 - 3742.32] P:1720.47 E:0.087508 |  has now just managed to wrap up the first set
[3742.32 - 3745.44] P:1449.11 E:0.095169 |  against the World Number 298, the Brit's Soné Cartel.
[3745.44 - 3748.64] P:1455.15 E:0.084252 |  Six-four, she's taken the first set of this third round match.
[3749.60 - 3751.20] P:1645.01 E:0.098497 |  Thank you very much for that, Mas.
[3751.20 - 3754.00] P:1725.05 E:0.091406 |  Remember, as always, Coverage continues on Sports Extra
[3754.00 - 3756.56] P:1820.92 E:0.089418 |  with updates here on Five Live Sport.
[3756.56 - 3758.80] P:1885.06 E:0.085575 |  Here in Hamburg, Chris Sutton and Alistair Bruce Ball,
[3758.80 - 3760.00] P:1737.35 E:0.095255 |  who you've just been hearing from,
[3760.00 - 3762.16] P:1878.00 E:0.088361 |  will bring us commentary of that big game
[3762.16 - 3764.48] P:1852.24 E:0.080543 |  between France and Portugal.
[3764.48 - 3766.48] P:1835.28 E:0.085377 |  In the meantime, we're going to head back to Stuttgart,
[3766.48 - 3769.68] P:1673.33 E:0.088851 |  where no goals is yet between Spain and Germany.
[3769.68 - 3773.60] P:1700.28 E:0.095989 |  Taking you through the second half, Cat Nevin and Ian Dennis.
[3773.60 - 3776.40] P:1914.85 E:0.086683 |  Thank you, Kelly. We have a change, though, for Spain.
[3776.48 - 3778.96] P:1874.51 E:0.093350 |  Leynall Mann, who was booked in the first half,
[3778.96 - 3780.72] P:1839.13 E:0.074537 |  and should Spain progress,
[3780.72 - 3782.56] P:1703.83 E:0.103803 |  he would be banned for the semi-final,
[3782.56 - 3785.92] P:1793.40 E:0.082679 |  has been replaced at halftime by Nacho.
[3785.92 - 3789.28] P:1955.18 E:0.092877 |  His only appearance was a start against Croatia
[3789.28 - 3791.52] P:1883.47 E:0.087744 |  in the first game.
[3791.52 - 3793.52] P:1943.05 E:0.101231 |  So, Spain line-up with Simon Engol,
[3793.52 - 3795.76] P:1861.64 E:0.093553 |  Carvajal Nacho, La Porta and Cucarrea,
[3795.76 - 3798.40] P:1798.71 E:0.089811 |  Fabian Rodri and Olmo in the midfield.
[3798.40 - 3801.52] P:1823.06 E:0.091158 |  Olmo, remember, came on in the first half for Petri,
[3801.52 - 3804.24] P:1857.36 E:0.084884 |  Williams, Yamal and Marathe.
[3804.24 - 3810.64] P:1815.36 E:0.092012 |  And in fact, Germany are going to be making a double change.
[3810.64 - 3814.08] P:1902.53 E:0.089145 |  Leroy Sarne has come off,
[3814.08 - 3816.72] P:1851.93 E:0.094693 |  and I think that is, indeed it is,
[3816.72 - 3819.44] P:1782.04 E:0.098272 |  Florian Wirtz is going to replace him,
[3819.44 - 3823.92] P:1800.62 E:0.086838 |  and Chan has also come off to be replaced by André.
[3823.92 - 3827.20] P:1821.69 E:0.077850 |  So, a double change being made by Germany.
[3827.20 - 3829.84] P:1870.25 E:0.099905 |  Well, it doesn't look really bad to me,
[3829.84 - 3832.00] P:1785.34 E:0.099725 |  but that's quite a lot of changes, isn't it?
[3832.08 - 3834.00] P:1720.73 E:0.097476 |  There are two changes at halftime there,
[3834.00 - 3835.68] P:1755.64 E:0.089427 |  but Chan wasn't...
[3835.68 - 3837.68] P:1749.05 E:0.090257 |  I thought he should have been booked anyway.
[3837.68 - 3840.40] P:1760.19 E:0.095686 |  They didn't look to me as if they had enough energy.
[3840.40 - 3842.56] P:1696.26 E:0.087107 |  I think they needed to add a little bit of energy,
[3842.56 - 3846.72] P:1806.38 E:0.078897 |  and if it's Sarne's come off for Wirtz,
[3846.72 - 3848.80] P:1720.58 E:0.083577 |  I think that might give a chance on Moussiali
[3848.80 - 3851.36] P:1851.61 E:0.078073 |  to go and switch wings, which is better over the other wing.
[3851.36 - 3853.12] P:1789.91 E:0.088537 |  So, she'll see if that makes a difference.
[3853.12 - 3856.80] P:1906.12 E:0.088558 |  Well, Wirtz straight away has introduced himself
[3856.80 - 3861.68] P:1958.64 E:0.078860 |  and has caught La Porta with a wrap around the heels.
[3861.68 - 3865.52] P:1929.36 E:0.079550 |  Wirtz just gets a talking to from Anthony Taylor.
[3865.52 - 3868.64] P:1859.14 E:0.076183 |  So, André replacing with his dyed pink hair.
[3869.28 - 3872.96] P:1863.05 E:0.084133 |  He's certainly standing out in the middle of that midfield.
[3873.52 - 3875.52] P:1899.08 E:0.083202 |  So, it means that Neuer is in goal,
[3875.52 - 3878.40] P:1870.49 E:0.082250 |  a back four of Kimmich, Rudiger, Tahr and Raum,
[3878.96 - 3883.28] P:1916.98 E:0.083772 |  Kroos, André and Gunduan, Wirtz, Habertz and Moussiali.
[3884.08 - 3886.72] P:1951.55 E:0.076584 |  For Germany, all in whites,
[3886.72 - 3889.84] P:2076.45 E:0.090445 |  against Spain in their red shirts and royal
[3889.84 - 3891.12] P:1997.79 E:0.097848 |  and their navy blue shorts,
[3891.12 - 3893.36] P:2041.80 E:0.081965 |  they're playing from left to right to Spain,
[3893.36 - 3896.48] P:1954.86 E:0.087827 |  where the majority of that red is behind that goal
[3896.48 - 3897.60] P:1594.27 E:0.100963 |  away towards our right.
[3897.60 - 3900.80] P:1862.17 E:0.073594 |  But early in the second half, and it started again
[3900.80 - 3905.04] P:1880.19 E:0.071473 |  in a stop-start fashion that was symptomatic,
[3905.04 - 3906.40] P:1775.46 E:0.093717 |  really, of much of the first half.
[3906.40 - 3909.20] P:1585.64 E:0.092180 |  Well, particularly the very beginning, 10, 15 minutes
[3909.20 - 3911.44] P:1668.44 E:0.086988 |  when you wanted the game to really explode,
[3911.44 - 3913.76] P:1816.82 E:0.070526 |  and it couldn't get going.
[3913.76 - 3917.20] P:1740.14 E:0.081480 |  Once again, everyone is up for this second half start.
[3917.76 - 3919.28] P:1611.60 E:0.116254 |  And right away, you've got an injury,
[3919.28 - 3920.88] P:1710.26 E:0.084089 |  and I don't think that was it.
[3920.88 - 3923.60] P:1680.91 E:0.098970 |  He wasn't pretending there, I think it was natural when down.
[3924.48 - 3925.92] P:1887.77 E:0.105748 |  Got his foot trodden on,
[3925.92 - 3928.48] P:1790.97 E:0.065862 |  but let's see if we've got a little bit better now.
[3928.48 - 3931.68] P:1853.41 E:0.101200 |  Carvajal comes forward and comes inside, and he finds Olmo.
[3931.68 - 3932.72] P:1887.13 E:0.097948 |  Olmo, there's no width.
[3932.72 - 3933.84] P:1904.06 E:0.094354 |  Williams has gone on ahead of him,
[3933.84 - 3936.40] P:1919.75 E:0.091071 |  but he does find Williams inside the penalty area.
[3936.40 - 3937.76] P:1856.23 E:0.084345 |  Williams with the cross.
[3937.76 - 3939.76] P:1920.59 E:0.091101 |  Yamal brings it under control, off his left foot,
[3939.76 - 3940.88] P:1867.39 E:0.107664 |  rolls it towards Marata.
[3940.88 - 3943.92] P:1838.77 E:0.102983 |  Marata with a turn, puts it over the top, seven yards out.
[3944.88 - 3945.92] P:1793.21 E:0.034915 |  Real chance.
[3945.92 - 3947.92] P:1824.74 E:0.094473 |  That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
[3947.92 - 3951.04] P:1805.58 E:0.087287 |  By a wing, wing up, crosses off to the other one,
[3951.04 - 3953.84] P:1807.03 E:0.080843 |  and Yamal's clever enough not to just go and whip it,
[3953.84 - 3956.32] P:1805.55 E:0.074822 |  and it's tough to beat the two centre-backs.
[3956.32 - 3959.60] P:1806.20 E:0.089287 |  Obviously, Rudergan, the air, so he's put it into feet there,
[3959.60 - 3962.48] P:1778.14 E:0.089834 |  and he's got a very, very quick turn there on.
[3962.48 - 3966.56] P:1795.32 E:0.077531 |  Now, the referee seems to have pointed to some sort of a free kick,
[3966.56 - 3968.64] P:1837.51 E:0.077229 |  because it certainly didn't look offside to me
[3968.64 - 3969.92] P:1743.74 E:0.095280 |  when that ball was played in,
[3969.92 - 3971.92] P:1779.55 E:0.083099 |  but it couldn't quite keep it on target,
[3971.92 - 3973.60] P:1610.71 E:0.082561 |  but clever play there.
[3973.60 - 3975.60] P:1891.57 E:0.065918 |  We had a brief word with Antonio,
[3975.60 - 3978.08] P:1887.93 E:0.093088 |  a Spanish commentator at halftime,
[3978.08 - 3981.52] P:1912.11 E:0.087761 |  who was in full agreement with everything that you said
[3981.52 - 3984.72] P:1908.60 E:0.073160 |  in your summary with Kelly at the break.
[3984.72 - 3987.36] P:1692.18 E:0.084955 |  Yeah, particularly about the referee not moving the Spanish,
[3987.36 - 3990.96] P:1808.71 E:0.085869 |  but that's not a shock in Spanish radio, is it?
[3990.96 - 3993.36] P:1726.68 E:0.073655 |  Two and a half minutes into the second half,
[3993.36 - 3994.96] P:1735.84 E:0.098512 |  five live and BBC sounds.
[3994.96 - 3997.76] P:1859.63 E:0.089856 |  Virts touches the ball, Havertz man over,
[3997.76 - 4000.56] P:1821.14 E:0.086967 |  his kimmick right-hand side of the penalty area.
[4001.12 - 4002.56] P:1818.17 E:0.088615 |  Closed down by Cucaraya.
[4002.56 - 4003.56] P:1811.85 E:0.071756 |  Back towards...
[4003.56 - 4005.56] P:1845.67 E:0.093529 |  Andric hits it first time, it's curling,
[4005.56 - 4007.56] P:1793.77 E:0.096143 |  it's always going away from...
[4007.56 - 4009.56] P:1912.17 E:0.085295 |  from goal, from Robert Andric.
[4009.56 - 4013.56] P:1923.80 E:0.065034 |  And it will be a goal kick to Spain.
[4013.56 - 4016.56] P:1862.75 E:0.086389 |  I remember coming here in 2006,
[4016.56 - 4019.56] P:1715.06 E:0.089301 |  it was a UEFA Cup tie with Middlesbrough.
[4019.56 - 4022.56] P:1691.64 E:0.087176 |  They've since removed the running track,
[4022.56 - 4024.56] P:1941.27 E:0.087784 |  they've actually lowered the pitch,
[4024.56 - 4026.56] P:1790.65 E:0.097792 |  the stands have been moved closer to the action.
[4026.56 - 4029.56] P:1843.60 E:0.088832 |  It really is quite an expansive, but tidy stadium.
[4029.56 - 4031.56] P:1710.37 E:0.099299 |  It's a lovely stadium.
[4031.56 - 4034.56] P:1860.19 E:0.071389 |  Odd enough, I've seen a lot of stadiums here in Germany,
[4034.56 - 4037.56] P:1779.88 E:0.103771 |  which have held the atmosphere a lot better than it,
[4037.56 - 4039.56] P:1761.37 E:0.076804 |  but it's still a very impressive stadium,
[4039.56 - 4043.56] P:1755.67 E:0.072172 |  and let's be honest, they all have been in this tournament.
[4043.56 - 4045.56] P:1853.15 E:0.036837 |  Yes, they have.
[4045.56 - 4049.56] P:1772.64 E:0.079972 |  This is the Stuttgart, where Germany have a decent record.
[4049.56 - 4052.56] P:1730.57 E:0.090121 |  They're unbeaten in eight when they played here in Stuttgart,
[4052.56 - 4054.56] P:1935.28 E:0.084104 |  holds 54,000,
[4054.56 - 4057.56] P:1860.69 E:0.085718 |  and German voices trying to make themselves heard again,
[4057.56 - 4060.56] P:1832.15 E:0.089588 |  keep the host nation going.
[4060.56 - 4062.56] P:1910.05 E:0.077930 |  Spain, who have a wretched record,
[4062.56 - 4065.56] P:1804.00 E:0.095650 |  they have never, ever beaten the host nation
[4065.56 - 4068.56] P:1910.02 E:0.087348 |  at a major tournament in nine attempts.
[4068.56 - 4070.56] P:1902.43 E:0.083106 |  And indeed, in each of the last three,
[4070.56 - 4075.56] P:1880.68 E:0.075055 |  they've drawn and they've been eliminated on penalties.
[4075.56 - 4079.56] P:1875.85 E:0.089218 |  Certainly chances at a premium so far, early in the second half,
[4079.56 - 4082.56] P:1848.09 E:0.081717 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds,
[4082.56 - 4085.56] P:1774.74 E:0.086111 |  as Roger goes back to Simon.
[4085.56 - 4088.56] P:1766.70 E:0.091883 |  And talking of BBC Sounds, tomorrow is the sort of day
[4088.56 - 4091.56] P:1744.57 E:0.087254 |  that is made for it to take 5 Live with you wherever you go,
[4091.56 - 4093.56] P:1798.07 E:0.103632 |  and you think that New Zealand, England,
[4093.56 - 4096.56] P:1786.45 E:0.096607 |  the Rugby Union test gets underway at 5 past eight,
[4096.56 - 4099.56] P:1788.29 E:0.096808 |  the Rimbaldon coverage, England, Switzerland at five,
[4099.56 - 4104.56] P:1855.37 E:0.075790 |  to be followed by the Netherlands against Turkey at eight o'clock.
[4104.56 - 4106.56] P:1892.91 E:0.091663 |  So much live sport to look forward to.
[4106.56 - 4109.56] P:1827.70 E:0.077591 |  Throw in the British Grand Prix on Sunday as well,
[4109.56 - 4113.56] P:1822.59 E:0.063444 |  and hopefully 5 Live will get your vote.
[4114.56 - 4117.56] P:1771.62 E:0.074523 |  Five minutes into the second half, 0-0.
[4117.56 - 4120.56] P:1752.40 E:0.057132 |  Here is round. Back to Andric.
[4120.56 - 4123.56] P:1794.13 E:0.069596 |  Probs it, intercepted by Yamal,
[4123.56 - 4126.56] P:1869.37 E:0.073163 |  and he just lifts it out of play, catches it,
[4126.56 - 4128.56] P:1722.81 E:0.095590 |  and it will be a Germany throw.
[4128.56 - 4130.56] P:1628.79 E:0.095810 |  It's a shame it's such a beautiful little touch.
[4130.56 - 4133.56] P:1886.08 E:0.090430 |  We have a question to ask you about our Spanish journalist friend.
[4133.56 - 4136.56] P:1799.45 E:0.093684 |  Do you only bring him up because you think he looks like me?
[4136.56 - 4138.56] P:1885.71 E:0.078715 |  He's my brother.
[4138.56 - 4141.56] P:1696.34 E:0.099408 |  Didn't think you looked anything like Tommy.
[4141.56 - 4144.56] P:1810.27 E:0.091886 |  Famously. Talk to my people about that.
[4144.56 - 4149.56] P:1827.80 E:0.088520 |  Here is Kukareya, far side the left, chips it in field.
[4149.56 - 4152.56] P:1728.17 E:0.096510 |  Murata got a challenge from behind by Tahr,
[4152.56 - 4154.56] P:1783.60 E:0.091935 |  right in front of the referee,
[4154.56 - 4157.56] P:1944.94 E:0.088928 |  and again, Anthony Taylor tried to let the game flow.
[4157.56 - 4160.56] P:1908.83 E:0.087567 |  He did actually well to get something on it, Murata,
[4160.56 - 4162.56] P:1833.96 E:0.084432 |  but it was a clear foul.
[4162.56 - 4164.56] P:1778.44 E:0.084525 |  Free kick to Spain outside the centre-circle.
[4164.56 - 4166.56] P:1505.62 E:0.088065 |  Again, if we get something wrong, we have to see it.
[4166.56 - 4168.56] P:1753.93 E:0.077063 |  When he gets it right, the position,
[4168.56 - 4171.56] P:1608.30 E:0.089104 |  the ball is spot-on, seeing exactly what Tahr was doing there,
[4171.56 - 4173.56] P:1720.61 E:0.082330 |  and tried to let it play on.
[4173.56 - 4175.56] P:1704.79 E:0.036497 |  Did everything right there.
[4176.56 - 4179.56] P:1656.93 E:0.089598 |  Puyong is in the crowd.
[4179.56 - 4183.56] P:1687.84 E:0.085559 |  Piquet as well, I noticed, just sat in front of him down below.
[4183.56 - 4185.56] P:1581.64 E:0.100111 |  I have to see one of my favourite players,
[4185.56 - 4188.56] P:1623.22 E:0.079343 |  Heistro Rolf, football player, wonderful, wonderful player.
[4188.56 - 4190.56] P:1771.71 E:0.081762 |  That's fantastic.
[4190.56 - 4194.56] P:1708.97 E:0.102537 |  Here is Lameen Yamal running in from the right-hand side.
[4195.56 - 4198.56] P:1811.35 E:0.109258 |  And Dany Olmo coming onto that ball,
[4198.56 - 4200.56] P:1808.36 E:0.101389 |  hitting it first time right-footed,
[4200.56 - 4203.56] P:1636.38 E:0.101452 |  and Spain take the lead, right-footed,
[4203.56 - 4205.56] P:1746.98 E:0.097181 |  finds the bottom left-hand corner.
[4205.56 - 4207.56] P:1769.68 E:0.097801 |  Germany didn't react,
[4207.56 - 4210.56] P:1774.35 E:0.097818 |  and Dany Olmo gives Spain the breakthrough, 1-0.
[4210.56 - 4213.56] P:1763.42 E:0.097297 |  It's very noticeable that all the way through this game,
[4213.56 - 4215.56] P:1477.79 E:0.101786 |  Spain have been doing this.
[4215.56 - 4217.56] P:1676.95 E:0.112329 |  They do not lump the crosses in when they get away.
[4217.56 - 4221.56] P:1804.29 E:0.100060 |  They try to pass it in and find somebody running in from a deep area.
[4221.56 - 4223.56] P:1728.71 E:0.101119 |  A lot of the team has gone to Murata.
[4223.56 - 4226.56] P:1756.43 E:0.092643 |  This time almost coming from that deep area there.
[4226.56 - 4228.56] P:1829.74 E:0.090279 |  They didn't take a touch.
[4228.56 - 4230.56] P:1730.66 E:0.119239 |  He knew that he only had one possibility.
[4230.56 - 4234.56] P:1741.37 E:0.092948 |  First time, and he takes it, and he caresses it.
[4234.56 - 4237.56] P:1694.71 E:0.094575 |  Rather beautifully into the bottom corner there.
[4237.56 - 4239.56] P:1739.33 E:0.097604 |  But a lot of lovely pick-out there is,
[4239.56 - 4241.56] P:1760.09 E:0.088649 |  from Yamal on the right-hand side.
[4241.56 - 4244.56] P:1682.34 E:0.096380 |  Super wing play, and really intelligent pass there.
[4245.56 - 4247.56] P:1828.54 E:0.106524 |  But he came so late.
[4247.56 - 4250.56] P:1845.61 E:0.100300 |  Nobody picked up the run of Olmo, just inside the penalty area.
[4250.56 - 4252.56] P:1745.28 E:0.086479 |  Hit it first, time right-footed.
[4254.56 - 4257.56] P:1746.53 E:0.088271 |  And Neuer was given no chance, and Spain lead.
[4257.56 - 4259.56] P:1778.47 E:0.105268 |  It's something that the Spanish obviously work on.
[4259.56 - 4261.56] P:1638.99 E:0.096501 |  We see them do it time and time again.
[4261.56 - 4263.56] P:1641.64 E:0.090621 |  I mean, don't lump it in.
[4263.56 - 4265.56] P:1774.46 E:0.088058 |  If you have got centre-forward up there,
[4265.56 - 4267.56] P:1713.20 E:0.108226 |  and even though it's Murata, and he'll try and take on,
[4267.56 - 4269.56] P:1747.66 E:0.092391 |  he's got Taa, and he's got Routhiga.
[4269.56 - 4271.56] P:1697.81 E:0.095750 |  Don't lump it into the box.
[4271.56 - 4273.56] P:1761.42 E:0.094993 |  The chance is that you're not going to get anything.
[4273.56 - 4276.56] P:1714.02 E:0.104324 |  But if you pass it into the box and look for players running from deep,
[4276.56 - 4278.56] P:1564.90 E:0.106293 |  you can score, as they did there.
[4278.56 - 4280.56] P:1696.96 E:0.086678 |  Daniel Moe scored.
[4280.56 - 4282.56] P:1889.49 E:0.095678 |  The fourth goal against Georgia.
[4282.56 - 4284.56] P:1945.21 E:0.107388 |  That's his second goal of this tournament.
[4284.56 - 4286.56] P:1932.29 E:0.083555 |  And all of a sudden, now Germany have got a problem.
[4286.56 - 4288.56] P:1717.13 E:0.096975 |  Because if they were just trying to contain Spain
[4288.56 - 4290.56] P:1846.63 E:0.080823 |  in that first half, and the early stages of the second,
[4290.56 - 4292.56] P:1783.96 E:0.092133 |  they're going to have to come out.
[4292.56 - 4294.56] P:1697.95 E:0.104108 |  But by doing so, they're going to expose themselves
[4294.56 - 4296.56] P:1601.57 E:0.085947 |  to the pace that Spain have with Williams and Yamal.
[4296.56 - 4299.56] P:1886.62 E:0.091680 |  We could have done with that first goal right at the start of the first half.
[4299.56 - 4302.56] P:1800.40 E:0.086883 |  How about a goal early in the second, and that should definitely open up
[4302.56 - 4304.56] P:1645.78 E:0.096201 |  a bit of a gap between the two.
[4304.56 - 4306.56] P:1604.25 E:0.102187 |  And already has.
[4306.56 - 4308.56] P:1767.52 E:0.082741 |  Gündewan to Round. Left-hand side of the penalty area.
[4308.56 - 4311.56] P:1857.37 E:0.096048 |  Cross takes the deflection. Simon did ever so well there.
[4311.56 - 4314.56] P:1876.81 E:0.102112 |  Because the cross took a deflection, he got a fingertip save onto it,
[4314.56 - 4316.56] P:1849.40 E:0.080341 |  and it allowed Spain then to eventually clear the ball
[4316.56 - 4318.56] P:1986.88 E:0.093250 |  out of the penalty area.
[4318.56 - 4320.56] P:1813.36 E:0.087132 |  But Germany have won it back.
[4320.56 - 4322.56] P:1807.94 E:0.091631 |  Round passes the ball back towards Kroos.
[4322.56 - 4324.56] P:1774.91 E:0.092318 |  Kroos keeps it in play.
[4324.56 - 4326.56] P:1914.37 E:0.089855 |  This is Taa on the halfway line, left of the centre circle.
[4326.56 - 4328.56] P:1976.37 E:0.073647 |  Gündewan.
[4328.56 - 4330.56] P:1728.45 E:0.085247 |  He's got a good chance of getting the ball in the centre.
[4330.56 - 4332.56] P:1617.04 E:0.064987 |  The ball is out of the line. Left of the centre circle.
[4332.56 - 4334.56] P:1833.39 E:0.096073 |  Gündewan.
[4334.56 - 4336.56] P:1736.10 E:0.073620 |  Musiála to Round.
[4336.56 - 4338.56] P:1704.10 E:0.101584 |  Yamal picked up now by Musiála,
[4338.56 - 4340.56] P:1746.64 E:0.102596 |  driving the Spanish defence.
[4340.56 - 4342.56] P:1847.71 E:0.089841 |  Left-hand side of the box.
[4342.56 - 4344.56] P:1889.93 E:0.091661 |  Back towards Gündewan.
[4344.56 - 4346.56] P:1856.83 E:0.087342 |  Gündewan's cross.
[4346.56 - 4348.56] P:1810.94 E:0.084377 |  Kukerea tucked in. Heads it out.
[4348.56 - 4350.56] P:1768.16 E:0.101841 |  Andric passes the ball forward.
[4350.56 - 4352.56] P:1865.27 E:0.090647 |  Williams. All of a sudden, Spain can come forward now.
[4352.56 - 4354.56] P:1737.35 E:0.096306 |  Maratah away to the left.
[4354.56 - 4356.56] P:1802.69 E:0.098083 |  Olmo going on ahead of him.
[4356.56 - 4358.56] P:1978.96 E:0.101014 |  Williams looks for Olmo. Jonathan Taa will get there first
[4358.56 - 4362.16] P:1950.67 E:0.094532 |  with a back pass towards Neuer, and the game has certainly now stepped up.
[4362.16 - 4365.00] P:1764.13 E:0.100111 |  Yeah, this is a game we're respecting, it's finally happened.
[4365.00 - 4368.08] P:1824.22 E:0.089970 |  And you understand why it takes a lot of will, but just notice it now.
[4368.08 - 4371.00] P:1769.97 E:0.106305 |  Ram, he's almost playing like a right wing, a left winger.
[4371.00 - 4373.48] P:1915.99 E:0.097977 |  This game is so open immediately.
[4373.48 - 4375.20] P:1940.22 E:0.061896 |  This is Kymik.
[4375.20 - 4377.00] P:1821.50 E:0.100218 |  Kymik out towards that far side,
[4377.00 - 4379.00] P:1927.02 E:0.106937 |  Virts with a cross, forced towards Gundogam,
[4379.00 - 4382.20] P:1998.13 E:0.090520 |  taken away from his former Manchester City teammate, Rodri.
[4382.20 - 4385.64] P:1979.77 E:0.093521 |  He was pulling back the right boot, he was looking to hit that on the volley.
[4385.64 - 4388.48] P:1940.25 E:0.095345 |  But Rodri, right place, right time for Spang.
[4389.24 - 4391.88] P:1772.84 E:0.107662 |  Good reaction from the Germans, they're in the front foot here,
[4391.88 - 4394.04] P:1821.21 E:0.086237 |  creating chances all over the place.
[4394.04 - 4397.76] P:1801.26 E:0.102281 |  This is Andri, Mussiala, Mussiala again, Rodri,
[4397.76 - 4400.36] P:1900.65 E:0.088787 |  with a well-timed intervention with a challenge,
[4400.36 - 4403.68] P:1885.47 E:0.087813 |  because Mussiala was looking to try and get that shot away.
[4403.68 - 4408.56] P:1686.60 E:0.081724 |  It's amazing, isn't it, that straight away, the sides now up the ante.
[4408.56 - 4411.64] P:1677.91 E:0.093325 |  Yeah, I mean, people don't like to take chances
[4411.64 - 4414.04] P:1611.75 E:0.101571 |  because you're the one who can make a mistake, well, the game's now gone.
[4414.04 - 4416.48] P:1819.18 E:0.098797 |  It's open now, and the Spaniards are loving it
[4416.48 - 4419.36] P:1857.89 E:0.080797 |  because they've got spaces to break into as well.
[4419.36 - 4422.48] P:1925.96 E:0.102085 |  And Williams finds Yamal, and Yamal up against Round,
[4422.48 - 4425.52] P:1939.74 E:0.099394 |  helped out by Williams, backheels the ball towards Yamal.
[4425.52 - 4428.72] P:1934.69 E:0.093880 |  Yamal enters the penalty area, Williams has a little dig at goal,
[4428.72 - 4430.56] P:1895.47 E:0.093386 |  and it was a challenge coming in.
[4430.56 - 4435.64] P:1916.52 E:0.082979 |  Falkrog is going to be coming on, Germany are going to be making a change.
[4435.64 - 4441.64] P:1836.10 E:0.072022 |  Julian Nagelsmann not deliberating, not hesitating.
[4441.64 - 4443.24] P:1716.95 E:0.109517 |  He's going to make a positive change.
[4443.24 - 4446.80] P:1791.53 E:0.092814 |  Very brave, he's made two at halftime, gone one down there,
[4446.80 - 4451.16] P:1866.83 E:0.098299 |  straight into it, he's not waiting for the usual 60th minute
[4451.16 - 4455.40] P:1856.97 E:0.081870 |  before he makes the change, and interested to see who comes off.
[4455.40 - 4458.04] P:1776.32 E:0.098974 |  I mean, he usually takes Havertz off to bring Falkrog on,
[4458.04 - 4460.16] P:1688.36 E:0.093647 |  but Havertz has looked pretty good in this game so far.
[4460.16 - 4462.52] P:1680.67 E:0.064151 |  Here is Gundewan.
[4462.52 - 4466.20] P:1826.83 E:0.091118 |  Wirtz, far side the right, Germany trailed by a goal to nil.
[4466.20 - 4469.32] P:1786.75 E:0.097580 |  Here is Gundewan with his back to goal, right-hand side of the penalty area.
[4469.32 - 4471.28] P:1874.41 E:0.079495 |  Wirtz tries to pass the ball inside.
[4471.32 - 4473.60] P:1778.66 E:0.092677 |  Fabian, who hasn't really got forward as much,
[4473.60 - 4476.04] P:1865.76 E:0.083283 |  that was Andric catching Williams.
[4476.04 - 4481.64] P:1942.42 E:0.083547 |  He's gone down as the Spain player, and a yellow card,
[4481.64 - 4486.04] P:1906.99 E:0.087149 |  and Robert Andric will miss the semi-final,
[4486.04 - 4489.08] P:1905.40 E:0.081388 |  like Rudiger should Germany progress.
[4489.08 - 4491.16] P:1909.38 E:0.094300 |  Let's get an update from Wimbledonian Carter.
[4491.16 - 4494.84] P:1796.57 E:0.095233 |  Encouraging start for Emma Radikhanu, that early break of serve,
[4494.84 - 4498.60] P:1872.12 E:0.097549 |  which means that she leads by three games to two.
[4498.60 - 4501.08] P:1813.74 E:0.087166 |  She did have the chance of a double break.
[4501.08 - 4504.04] P:1837.51 E:0.096806 |  She had love 40 on the Maria Sakari serve,
[4504.04 - 4505.72] P:1875.01 E:0.083568 |  but she couldn't capitalise,
[4505.72 - 4509.08] P:1807.90 E:0.093597 |  so it's 3-2 with just the one break of serve first set.
[4509.08 - 4511.44] P:1764.67 E:0.105721 |  Now let's check in with the other Britain on court,
[4511.44 - 4513.72] P:1744.02 E:0.088733 |  with Masferuki on court one.
[4513.72 - 4516.56] P:1456.53 E:0.100964 |  Not the second set that Sonny Kartell have hoped for.
[4516.56 - 4518.80] P:1588.44 E:0.104557 |  She's lost both her service games in this set,
[4518.80 - 4521.60] P:1646.23 E:0.103440 |  and his love fell down to the world number two,
[4521.60 - 4524.00] P:1550.96 E:0.100282 |  Coco Gough here on court one in the second set,
[4524.00 - 4527.28] P:1357.76 E:0.074038 |  having lost the first, remember, 4-6.
[4527.28 - 4529.72] P:1885.87 E:0.099398 |  Commentary on Wimbledon continues on sports extra,
[4529.72 - 4533.40] P:1794.26 E:0.104285 |  so the double change is Maximilian Mittelstadt replacing Raam,
[4533.40 - 4534.68] P:1832.23 E:0.099622 |  light for light.
[4534.68 - 4537.76] P:1852.80 E:0.110557 |  He had the three starts at left back in the group stages,
[4537.76 - 4541.08] P:1861.14 E:0.104655 |  didn't play against Denmark, the Stuttgart defender,
[4541.08 - 4543.24] P:1867.28 E:0.088242 |  here on his home ground,
[4543.24 - 4546.12] P:1803.31 E:0.105056 |  and Nicholas Fulkru, getting a wonderful ovation,
[4546.12 - 4549.52] P:1774.02 E:0.086644 |  who has come on and he has replaced Ilkai Gundawan.
[4549.52 - 4553.00] P:1847.05 E:0.092417 |  So that is the double change that has been made by Nagelsmann
[4553.00 - 4554.68] P:1957.30 E:0.088422 |  as Germany look for an equaliser.
[4554.68 - 4555.88] P:1789.95 E:0.080800 |  That's a clever change.
[4555.88 - 4557.92] P:1778.57 E:0.100203 |  I mean, the left back for left back, actually,
[4558.04 - 4560.56] P:1834.82 E:0.109737 |  I don't think Raam was doing particularly badly at all,
[4560.56 - 4563.92] P:1984.52 E:0.101836 |  but the plate, obviously, he would argue was at fault at the goal
[4563.92 - 4566.96] P:1835.72 E:0.080836 |  because it came from that right-hand side, and Jamal.
[4566.96 - 4569.12] P:1798.67 E:0.075264 |  But to see Gundawan off,
[4569.12 - 4573.28] P:1752.19 E:0.069710 |  it gives you the chance to put Havers back in his best position,
[4573.28 - 4575.20] P:1700.09 E:0.093000 |  which is, you know, number 10,
[4575.20 - 4577.52] P:1670.76 E:0.080852 |  that Riven Deep with Fulkru up top,
[4577.52 - 4580.28] P:1737.67 E:0.089107 |  so I can see the thinking of Nagelsmann there.
[4581.16 - 4584.28] P:1777.68 E:0.106480 |  Andrake snapping at the heels of Fabian Ruiz,
[4584.28 - 4586.96] P:1823.52 E:0.090509 |  who tries to get away from him and succeeds.
[4587.00 - 4590.72] P:1784.70 E:0.106159 |  Fabian now to Carvajal, Spain lead by Goulton Hill.
[4590.72 - 4593.16] P:1817.79 E:0.087509 |  Fabian looks to play in Olmo,
[4593.16 - 4595.04] P:1845.53 E:0.112366 |  and here is Olmo right corner of the area,
[4595.04 - 4596.60] P:1942.70 E:0.084750 |  enters the box, head looking up,
[4596.60 - 4598.32] P:1949.05 E:0.087396 |  Ruedigo with a clearance,
[4598.32 - 4601.60] P:1922.22 E:0.093530 |  and eventually, Kimmich will run the ball away for Germany.
[4601.60 - 4603.60] P:1871.32 E:0.097226 |  But then Rodry with the interception,
[4603.60 - 4607.56] P:2009.73 E:0.089422 |  Fabian to Murata, forward ball, might fall towards...
[4607.56 - 4609.76] P:1973.72 E:0.100137 |  Williams off a sliding challenge
[4609.76 - 4611.52] P:1940.31 E:0.090195 |  that was made by the Germany defence.
[4611.52 - 4613.84] P:1932.06 E:0.096458 |  Here is Wirtz under pressure from Kukereya.
[4613.84 - 4616.68] P:1961.77 E:0.084045 |  This is where Spain try with their intensity
[4616.68 - 4618.80] P:1961.12 E:0.075917 |  to pin the opposition back,
[4618.80 - 4621.04] P:1936.44 E:0.090167 |  and at the minute, they're trying to beat that pressure.
[4621.04 - 4624.88] P:1944.83 E:0.074610 |  Neuer towards Tar, lifts it up towards Mussiala.
[4624.88 - 4627.68] P:1909.83 E:0.088049 |  Nacho tight behind him, Spain with a turnover.
[4627.68 - 4630.76] P:1981.70 E:0.072345 |  Olmo, the goal scorer to Rodry.
[4630.76 - 4632.92] P:1829.63 E:0.094407 |  They are a very, very impressive side.
[4632.92 - 4635.08] P:1573.80 E:0.104712 |  Yeah, they are lovely on the ball.
[4635.08 - 4637.08] P:1834.51 E:0.099142 |  Just a few minutes ago, we were down the right-hand side,
[4637.08 - 4640.00] P:1801.95 E:0.085041 |  and they tried exactly the same pass into the box.
[4640.00 - 4642.32] P:1813.16 E:0.090684 |  You described it perfectly in the commentary there.
[4642.36 - 4643.84] P:1807.42 E:0.093526 |  They just don't want to end there.
[4643.84 - 4646.08] P:1843.25 E:0.092923 |  They don't even dink it to the back post.
[4646.08 - 4647.88] P:1886.24 E:0.105044 |  Middelstadt... Ooh!
[4647.88 - 4649.16] P:1923.71 E:0.120563 |  It's got away with one there.
[4649.16 - 4650.40] P:1954.13 E:0.096815 |  I caught Middelstadt caught,
[4650.40 - 4653.12] P:1829.35 E:0.088737 |  but Anthony Taylor has told him to get up.
[4653.12 - 4654.16] P:1892.34 E:0.089848 |  Middelstadt was booked.
[4654.16 - 4656.80] P:1840.65 E:0.091559 |  Here'd be another Germany player who'd missed the semi-final.
[4656.80 - 4658.00] P:1672.99 E:0.107809 |  Over on that far side,
[4658.00 - 4659.48] P:1896.77 E:0.089465 |  Wirtz to the right, Germany trail,
[4659.48 - 4661.00] P:1882.51 E:0.078752 |  five live-in BBC sounds,
[4661.00 - 4661.88] P:1824.37 E:0.099545 |  Kimmich with a cross,
[4661.88 - 4664.20] P:1788.85 E:0.090804 |  repelled by the head of Le Porte, firm header two,
[4664.20 - 4666.28] P:1882.79 E:0.083704 |  back out towards that far side.
[4666.28 - 4668.72] P:1810.47 E:0.087842 |  As Williams goes to ground, no foul.
[4668.72 - 4670.36] P:1884.84 E:0.091443 |  Instead, it'll be a Germany throw,
[4670.36 - 4671.60] P:1840.32 E:0.103346 |  midway through the Spain half,
[4671.60 - 4673.04] P:1916.87 E:0.086483 |  as we approach the almark.
[4673.04 - 4674.72] P:1787.03 E:0.114804 |  I love the way this is set on there,
[4674.72 - 4675.68] P:1904.85 E:0.100164 |  because Phil Krug is...
[4675.68 - 4676.68] P:1868.94 E:0.102528 |  You know, he's just up there.
[4676.68 - 4678.76] P:1824.28 E:0.102776 |  He's a batter around the centre forward.
[4678.76 - 4680.04] P:1874.15 E:0.115145 |  He's got a knife and a goal as well.
[4680.04 - 4681.48] P:1807.91 E:0.094494 |  And he'll attack everything,
[4681.48 - 4684.84] P:1832.83 E:0.102719 |  which will leave space for Havertz to come in at that back post.
[4684.84 - 4686.84] P:1940.16 E:0.088720 |  Middelstadt with the cross.
[4686.84 - 4688.08] P:1891.23 E:0.091816 |  Havertz was up.
[4688.08 - 4689.92] P:1811.69 E:0.090175 |  Le Porte got the header away,
[4689.92 - 4693.80] P:1845.86 E:0.088097 |  collected by Germany and Kimmich right-hand side to Rudiger.
[4693.80 - 4695.24] P:1776.60 E:0.100646 |  Level with a penalty area.
[4695.24 - 4696.64] P:1881.43 E:0.078524 |  Rudiger's cross,
[4696.64 - 4698.24] P:1758.38 E:0.102096 |  brief header there by Le Porte,
[4698.24 - 4700.08] P:1815.26 E:0.070593 |  brushed the top of his head.
[4700.08 - 4702.08] P:1890.91 E:0.103808 |  Yermal is going to try and get it.
[4702.08 - 4703.76] P:1862.63 E:0.116094 |  Middelstadt, no, gets it away from him.
[4703.76 - 4705.88] P:1876.38 E:0.079215 |  His cross blocked by Carvajal.
[4705.88 - 4707.76] P:1870.64 E:0.105918 |  Olmo now lifts the ball up in the air,
[4707.76 - 4709.20] P:1844.79 E:0.084946 |  deep inside his own half,
[4709.20 - 4710.96] P:1842.43 E:0.092226 |  and plays it up towards Marathe.
[4710.96 - 4712.64] P:1953.68 E:0.101604 |  But Kroos gets there first.
[4712.64 - 4714.64] P:1950.22 E:0.095057 |  Andric passes the ball forward.
[4714.64 - 4717.00] P:1975.30 E:0.100247 |  This is Vertz looking to turn and shoot.
[4717.00 - 4718.92] P:1869.83 E:0.090403 |  Right-footed off target.
[4718.92 - 4720.64] P:1929.84 E:0.112757 |  Took a deflection on his way through.
[4720.64 - 4722.48] P:1914.77 E:0.110199 |  Yeah. It's a corner kick to Germany.
[4722.48 - 4723.72] P:1780.16 E:0.119490 |  Loving the pace of this game.
[4723.72 - 4726.32] P:1957.51 E:0.111139 |  And of course, it helps that the Germans...
[4726.32 - 4727.76] P:1822.39 E:0.117504 |  It can hear me over them.
[4727.76 - 4729.72] P:1909.91 E:0.113767 |  The Germans are shooting into their fans,
[4729.72 - 4731.96] P:1950.22 E:0.105534 |  just now, and they react really well.
[4731.96 - 4735.16] P:1828.74 E:0.095618 |  Because before, really hadn't been playing at 100%.
[4735.16 - 4737.44] P:1755.34 E:0.094234 |  This is everything they've got so far.
[4737.44 - 4739.92] P:1791.86 E:0.090612 |  They are throwing the catch and sink in the Spanish.
[4742.12 - 4744.20] P:1632.00 E:0.098463 |  They trail by a goal to Niel.
[4744.20 - 4747.44] P:1700.57 E:0.087288 |  An hour played on five live MVBC sounds.
[4747.44 - 4748.72] P:1835.90 E:0.100952 |  Corner kick to Germany,
[4748.72 - 4750.72] P:1628.28 E:0.084229 |  playing from right to left as we look.
[4752.92 - 4754.76] P:1781.20 E:0.075032 |  Kroos to take it.
[4754.76 - 4756.28] P:1697.89 E:0.091367 |  Far side the right.
[4756.28 - 4758.76] P:1680.55 E:0.085250 |  Rudiger up from the back as his tar.
[4758.80 - 4759.84] P:1658.21 E:0.088246 |  Havertz there.
[4759.84 - 4760.84] P:1638.29 E:0.081582 |  Fulcrum.
[4760.84 - 4762.44] P:1882.00 E:0.093655 |  A lot of targets in it comes.
[4762.44 - 4765.56] P:1814.13 E:0.069884 |  Le Porte, good header away under pressure.
[4765.56 - 4767.72] P:1870.36 E:0.093332 |  Collected by Vertz, chips the ball in,
[4767.72 - 4771.32] P:1899.28 E:0.089168 |  but chips it too long and out for a goal kick.
[4771.32 - 4773.24] P:1705.85 E:0.099731 |  It's a massive disappointment for the Germans here,
[4773.24 - 4776.04] P:1869.55 E:0.077090 |  because they're working now to get any positions
[4776.04 - 4777.68] P:1832.04 E:0.084913 |  just to put it in the mixer.
[4777.68 - 4779.96] P:1814.68 E:0.092830 |  And you can't blame them for doing it.
[4779.96 - 4781.96] P:1821.90 E:0.088683 |  If they're going to play football on the ground
[4781.96 - 4784.56] P:1864.10 E:0.085933 |  against the Spanish side, they're actually being second best.
[4784.56 - 4786.92] P:1899.27 E:0.091391 |  Not by a huge amount, but not second best.
[4786.96 - 4789.72] P:1899.15 E:0.094661 |  So they've just looked at it and thought, OK, can't do that.
[4789.72 - 4791.36] P:1873.53 E:0.089794 |  Let's see if we can do something else.
[4791.36 - 4792.48] P:1816.64 E:0.107864 |  It's kind of worked for them so far.
[4792.48 - 4796.40] P:1887.64 E:0.078160 |  They're getting into good areas, but that was a clear crossing.
[4796.40 - 4800.16] P:1813.26 E:0.091734 |  This is Germany's 19th quarterfinal at a major tournament.
[4800.16 - 4803.40] P:1778.58 E:0.081399 |  It's a record for any European nation.
[4803.40 - 4806.68] P:1854.75 E:0.086159 |  They have progressed from 15 of the previous 18,
[4806.68 - 4809.40] P:1924.12 E:0.087611 |  and indeed each of the last seven.
[4809.40 - 4812.28] P:1802.15 E:0.090193 |  But they are behind by a goal to Niel.
[4812.28 - 4814.20] P:1906.05 E:0.087030 |  As Spain are going to be making a change,
[4814.20 - 4817.96] P:1715.56 E:0.078884 |  and Ferran Torres is the player who's going to be coming on.
[4817.96 - 4821.36] P:1776.46 E:0.093570 |  He's appeared in three of the four matches so far.
[4821.36 - 4824.56] P:1884.19 E:0.083527 |  Cross from that far side, the right, from Kimmich,
[4824.56 - 4826.04] P:1835.65 E:0.087259 |  blocked by Cucarrea.
[4826.04 - 4829.88] P:1859.70 E:0.089976 |  They must be temptation off to bring their young Jamal off.
[4829.88 - 4831.92] P:1787.17 E:0.087181 |  He's making a few mistakes defensively.
[4831.92 - 4834.36] P:1820.07 E:0.088173 |  He has to follow his left fullback
[4834.36 - 4836.32] P:1762.86 E:0.074283 |  when he overlaps at this point in time.
[4836.32 - 4838.20] P:1677.83 E:0.072186 |  The moment he's finding it difficult.
[4838.20 - 4840.76] P:1938.27 E:0.111795 |  Cucarrea, ball over the top,
[4840.84 - 4843.00] P:1932.91 E:0.107700 |  who has looked towards Haberks and Cucarrea,
[4843.00 - 4844.72] P:1968.44 E:0.084102 |  couldn't take any chances,
[4844.72 - 4846.68] P:1839.48 E:0.100731 |  and headed it behind for a corner kick
[4846.68 - 4849.24] P:1894.03 E:0.081221 |  that Germany have looked about taking it quickly,
[4849.24 - 4851.28] P:1887.77 E:0.072562 |  and then have had second thoughts.
[4851.28 - 4855.08] P:1735.08 E:0.085072 |  And it isn't going to be LaMiglia Mal,
[4855.08 - 4857.24] P:1853.89 E:0.082441 |  who is the player coming off.
[4857.24 - 4860.76] P:1928.94 E:0.098182 |  So the youngest ever player at a European championship,
[4860.76 - 4863.52] P:1998.51 E:0.097129 |  still looking to be the youngest goal scorer,
[4863.52 - 4865.80] P:2014.34 E:0.103387 |  makes way for Ferran Torres.
[4865.80 - 4867.56] P:1955.99 E:0.102665 |  But he did get an assist.
[4867.56 - 4868.88] P:1897.61 E:0.113748 |  He got a give-up on that.
[4868.88 - 4872.12] P:2105.63 E:0.107260 |  The most important passer again so far was made by him.
[4872.12 - 4874.32] P:1997.48 E:0.113594 |  But he's beginning to get pushed a little bit further back,
[4874.32 - 4877.80] P:1976.29 E:0.090666 |  and he wasn't making the right decisions defensively.
[4877.80 - 4881.96] P:1918.87 E:0.090721 |  Totally and utterly understand why Dela Flanthard brought him off,
[4881.96 - 4883.68] P:1832.19 E:0.084233 |  even though it's always sad to see it,
[4883.68 - 4885.80] P:1868.26 E:0.080931 |  because he is a special, special talent
[4885.80 - 4889.88] P:1876.90 E:0.083605 |  that we're going to be seeing a lot of in the next 15 to 20 years.
[4889.88 - 4890.92] P:1985.61 E:0.111852 |  So Torres is on.
[4890.92 - 4894.04] P:1953.26 E:0.093828 |  Every red shirt is inside the penalty area.
[4894.04 - 4897.44] P:2035.63 E:0.096082 |  Corner kick to Germany, looking for an equaliser.
[4897.44 - 4899.44] P:1954.46 E:0.106219 |  With 27 minutes remaining.
[4901.36 - 4903.88] P:1969.40 E:0.102647 |  Cross, hands-on hips, waits to deliver.
[4906.40 - 4909.76] P:1898.07 E:0.109363 |  Referee Anthony Taylor is calling Rudiger towards him.
[4909.76 - 4914.08] P:2015.65 E:0.093514 |  Rudiger's already on a yellow card, and also Nico Williams.
[4915.24 - 4918.20] P:1819.98 E:0.094027 |  Now there is the referee's whistle. Play can resume.
[4918.20 - 4919.76] P:1900.98 E:0.108286 |  Corner kick, fast side the right.
[4919.76 - 4922.00] P:1908.34 E:0.085158 |  Full crook with the header, drops off target,
[4922.00 - 4924.80] P:1928.82 E:0.074332 |  and out for a goal kick. Spain still lead.
[4924.84 - 4928.88] P:1854.56 E:0.099528 |  This is going to be very, very difficult indeed for the Spanish.
[4928.88 - 4930.68] P:1760.46 E:0.075252 |  They're going to... This sort of...
[4930.68 - 4933.12] P:1854.98 E:0.098231 |  I mean, everywhere left, right, from deep,
[4933.12 - 4934.80] P:1877.26 E:0.092619 |  it's all going to put into that area.
[4934.80 - 4936.48] P:1933.97 E:0.096602 |  Full crook's going to attack everything.
[4936.48 - 4938.16] P:1949.25 E:0.099404 |  The centre-backs are going to be up.
[4938.16 - 4940.24] P:1977.45 E:0.097893 |  We know how the answer is a danger.
[4940.24 - 4945.60] P:2103.17 E:0.100664 |  It's going to be a long, oh, 27 minutes for the Spanish fans.
[4945.60 - 4947.28] P:2041.96 E:0.094754 |  Back to Wimbledon, Ian Carter.
[4947.28 - 4951.84] P:1979.16 E:0.102186 |  Two huge running forehands have helped Emma Radicalno dig herself out of trouble
[4951.84 - 4956.00] P:1926.64 E:0.087660 |  and hold serve after facing break points in the last service game.
[4956.00 - 4961.44] P:1744.62 E:0.082664 |  So Radicalno against Maria Sacuri, the Greek ninth seed,
[4961.44 - 4964.76] P:1628.86 E:0.078222 |  and Radicalno leads 4-2 first half.
[4964.76 - 4967.12] P:1859.58 E:0.114642 |  Whether it's Wimbledon or indeed the Euros,
[4967.12 - 4971.04] P:1917.48 E:0.096927 |  you can always listen to BBC Radio 5 Live through your smart speaker.
[4971.04 - 4974.72] P:1888.67 E:0.113574 |  All you've got to do is say, ask BBC Sounds to play Radio 5 Live.
[4975.96 - 4981.00] P:1849.09 E:0.082118 |  On this busy weekend that we're about to go into here,
[4981.04 - 4985.08] P:1884.37 E:0.081846 |  at SW19 and also across Germany.
[4985.08 - 4989.48] P:1903.31 E:0.096383 |  With 64 minutes play, the thunderclap echoes around Stuttgart
[4989.48 - 4991.84] P:1894.22 E:0.100571 |  as Simon comes to claim and collect that ball
[4991.84 - 4994.80] P:1896.10 E:0.078809 |  and now looks for the early release, right footed downfield.
[4994.80 - 4997.20] P:1984.63 E:0.092326 |  Almost goal is still the difference between the two.
[4997.20 - 5000.64] P:1909.21 E:0.113434 |  Middleshatt heads the ball forward towards Mussiala.
[5000.64 - 5002.64] P:1931.26 E:0.099761 |  There was no foul, says Carvajal.
[5002.64 - 5005.24] P:1912.02 E:0.082651 |  Anthony Taylor agrees, tells him to get up to his feet.
[5005.24 - 5007.36] P:1838.30 E:0.079296 |  As Havert comes in from the left touch line.
[5007.36 - 5010.32] P:1802.80 E:0.077958 |  Andric now onto the ball with that shock of pink hair.
[5010.36 - 5012.44] P:1892.24 E:0.091232 |  This is Wirtz looking to try and turn.
[5012.44 - 5015.44] P:1904.73 E:0.082747 |  He's side onto goal, coming on to it is Mussiala from deep.
[5016.64 - 5019.60] P:1901.70 E:0.114872 |  Fabian, oh, the decision has gone against Germany.
[5019.60 - 5023.04] P:1980.01 E:0.086925 |  Free kick to Spain, and wanted to take it quickly too.
[5023.04 - 5024.84] P:1857.14 E:0.096045 |  They couldn't get Ferran Torres on the ball.
[5024.84 - 5028.68] P:1850.77 E:0.087738 |  Yeah, I mean, Marathe, he's been clever trying to take it quickly there,
[5028.68 - 5031.36] P:1799.10 E:0.082429 |  but Marathe goes down and it's one of those things.
[5031.36 - 5034.88] P:1914.80 E:0.088314 |  It was the most tiniest touch in the back of his heel
[5034.88 - 5037.08] P:1690.00 E:0.096744 |  and he's completely and utterly collapsed on it there.
[5037.08 - 5038.96] P:1689.49 E:0.078392 |  And I think he's very unlucky.
[5038.96 - 5040.96] P:1924.62 E:0.092543 |  He's very lucky to get a free kick now.
[5041.96 - 5043.16] P:1913.66 E:0.082166 |  Marathe.
[5043.16 - 5044.52] P:1903.85 E:0.093488 |  Free kick to Spain.
[5044.52 - 5046.88] P:1777.21 E:0.089202 |  Fabian being pursued by Andric.
[5046.88 - 5048.76] P:1928.75 E:0.104740 |  Natural the substitute to Olmo,
[5048.76 - 5051.36] P:1900.79 E:0.091280 |  tried to roll away from Kroos.
[5051.36 - 5053.36] P:1912.36 E:0.102166 |  Kroos snapping away at his heels.
[5054.04 - 5057.44] P:1914.27 E:0.083497 |  Luis Delafuente apports the decision
[5057.44 - 5060.68] P:1805.52 E:0.065168 |  and apports Dani Olmo,
[5060.68 - 5062.20] P:1967.17 E:0.095714 |  whose goal is still the difference,
[5062.20 - 5065.80] P:1854.00 E:0.073853 |  that replacement early in the game for the injured Pedri.
[5065.84 - 5072.48] P:1856.26 E:0.067945 |  As Germany have about 25 minutes remaining
[5072.48 - 5075.84] P:1926.09 E:0.079315 |  to salvage their participation
[5077.16 - 5081.88] P:1947.86 E:0.089956 |  as the hosts in this Euro 2024 competition here in Germany.
[5081.88 - 5085.84] P:1853.24 E:0.086829 |  Fabian to Olmo, diagonal ball out then towards Ferran Torres,
[5085.84 - 5088.80] P:1857.29 E:0.089767 |  level with the penalty error on the right-hand side, back to Carvall.
[5088.80 - 5091.64] P:1948.65 E:0.087427 |  Little touch by Fabian, goes straight towards Tony Kroos,
[5091.64 - 5092.96] P:1990.05 E:0.087268 |  plays the ball in field,
[5092.96 - 5094.96] P:1973.00 E:0.095867 |  and it might just open up here for Germany.
[5094.96 - 5096.72] P:1876.86 E:0.107823 |  Full crook is ahead of him.
[5096.72 - 5098.32] P:1852.18 E:0.106044 |  Carvall does ever so well.
[5098.32 - 5100.60] P:1880.72 E:0.094136 |  Just gets a little touch with the right boot
[5100.60 - 5102.76] P:1890.86 E:0.096758 |  and Oonai Simon gathers it in safely.
[5102.76 - 5104.64] P:2023.06 E:0.088343 |  Spain still lead by a goal to Neal.
[5104.64 - 5106.36] P:1974.13 E:0.107617 |  Back to court one, Masferuki.
[5106.36 - 5108.56] P:1899.36 E:0.088728 |  The incredible run to the third round of Wimbledon
[5108.56 - 5110.36] P:1628.20 E:0.115462 |  for the world number 298.
[5110.36 - 5112.52] P:1625.48 E:0.111781 |  Sonny Cartel has come to an end here
[5112.52 - 5114.36] P:1669.66 E:0.109003 |  against the world number two, Coco Gough.
[5114.36 - 5116.36] P:1798.61 E:0.101299 |  It was a brilliantly evenly matched first set,
[5116.36 - 5119.24] P:1931.64 E:0.108554 |  but the US Open champion then raced away with the second.
[5119.24 - 5120.96] P:1753.00 E:0.098245 |  Gough coming through 6-4,
[5120.96 - 5123.96] P:1524.18 E:0.089758 |  6-love.
[5123.96 - 5125.96] P:1932.08 E:0.107280 |  Olmo took back by Kroos.
[5125.96 - 5127.96] P:1942.45 E:0.103231 |  He was running away from goal.
[5127.96 - 5129.36] P:1957.47 E:0.096782 |  They were covering defenders,
[5129.36 - 5131.96] P:1991.77 E:0.093911 |  but it was a cynical bit of play by Tony Kroos,
[5131.96 - 5134.36] P:2036.92 E:0.086989 |  who has shown a yellow card and he's booked.
[5134.36 - 5136.36] P:1652.44 E:0.094275 |  Yeah, I mean, brilliant play by the goalkeeper.
[5136.36 - 5138.16] P:1859.09 E:0.087610 |  They've done it quite a few times, Simon.
[5138.16 - 5141.36] P:1889.94 E:0.091485 |  He played 20, 30, 40 yards, sometimes 50-yard ball,
[5141.36 - 5142.36] P:1898.49 E:0.084879 |  straight up the pitch.
[5142.36 - 5145.36] P:1749.07 E:0.089656 |  It's not a lump. It's a pass into that area.
[5145.36 - 5147.36] P:1875.20 E:0.079020 |  He's done it again there. It's flicked on.
[5147.36 - 5148.96] P:1893.79 E:0.059860 |  Kroos has got booked.
[5148.96 - 5150.56] P:1727.58 E:0.075629 |  He should have been booked earlier.
[5150.56 - 5152.56] P:1796.80 E:0.096635 |  Had he been booked to the start of the first half,
[5152.56 - 5154.56] P:1759.78 E:0.080469 |  as every chance he probably wouldn't have done that.
[5154.56 - 5156.16] P:1858.51 E:0.075633 |  Correct. Correct.
[5156.16 - 5158.16] P:1791.44 E:0.096661 |  And Olmo would have been maybe away.
[5158.16 - 5162.16] P:1883.86 E:0.097097 |  Although it wasn't a denying of a goal-scoring opportunity.
[5162.16 - 5164.16] P:1925.65 E:0.086318 |  But we're midway through the second half,
[5164.16 - 5166.16] P:1921.56 E:0.101137 |  and Spain lead by a goal to nil.
[5168.56 - 5171.56] P:1854.71 E:0.091931 |  Danny Olmo with a goal, 6 minutes into the second half.
[5172.56 - 5174.56] P:1879.30 E:0.089875 |  Fabian with a free kick. Left foot, it chips it.
[5174.56 - 5176.56] P:1916.37 E:0.094118 |  Into the penalty area.
[5176.56 - 5178.56] P:1892.07 E:0.098190 |  He heads it back. Can you hear this?
[5180.56 - 5183.56] P:1877.21 E:0.088880 |  Danny Olmo, break up there with Mussiola.
[5183.56 - 5185.56] P:1746.03 E:0.093977 |  Mussiola then tries to hit it early.
[5186.56 - 5188.56] P:1950.33 E:0.114125 |  Virts is saying that he was being impeded.
[5188.56 - 5190.56] P:1890.91 E:0.112063 |  He has a word with the referee, Anthony Taylor,
[5190.56 - 5192.56] P:1993.43 E:0.098905 |  who just glares at him,
[5192.56 - 5194.56] P:2038.35 E:0.104554 |  and the ball goes all the way through to Unazimo.
[5194.56 - 5196.56] P:1908.32 E:0.093713 |  Really difficult time, moments now for the Germans,
[5196.56 - 5198.56] P:1926.20 E:0.078847 |  because, you know, since the goal,
[5198.56 - 5200.56] P:1870.16 E:0.078483 |  they stepped it up, and it can work for a well,
[5200.56 - 5202.56] P:1691.04 E:0.091559 |  and then they made a change, and that worked for a well.
[5202.56 - 5205.56] P:1811.62 E:0.075734 |  But so far, the Spanish have survived it,
[5205.56 - 5207.56] P:1899.90 E:0.084174 |  and can the Germans keep at that level?
[5207.56 - 5210.56] P:1891.10 E:0.099139 |  Because they need to do that between now and the end of the match.
[5210.56 - 5212.56] P:1925.36 E:0.095046 |  There's a quarter of the match to go,
[5212.56 - 5214.56] P:1858.47 E:0.095187 |  and they need to keep it up at that level,
[5214.56 - 5216.56] P:1997.25 E:0.081055 |  or else they will not score a goal.
[5216.56 - 5218.56] P:1926.79 E:0.101670 |  That's the voice of Pat Nevin here in Stuttgart,
[5218.56 - 5220.56] P:1914.20 E:0.081945 |  where Spain have a slender lead.
[5220.56 - 5222.56] P:1856.34 E:0.075319 |  Just over 20 minutes remaining.
[5222.56 - 5225.56] P:1903.44 E:0.086559 |  Fabian back then with Unazimo,
[5225.56 - 5228.56] P:1968.01 E:0.076468 |  chips it forward, over the head of Kimmich,
[5228.56 - 5230.56] P:1772.06 E:0.083283 |  downward header by Williams to Marata,
[5230.56 - 5233.56] P:1874.25 E:0.062201 |  deep inside his own half,
[5233.56 - 5235.56] P:1799.74 E:0.084729 |  forward ball with Fabian, Marata,
[5235.56 - 5238.56] P:1824.46 E:0.094515 |  now up towards the halfway line, trying to turn with Rudiger,
[5238.56 - 5240.56] P:1943.73 E:0.095612 |  feeds it, and the gap has appeared for Williams,
[5240.56 - 5243.56] P:1921.43 E:0.086489 |  as Kimmich was downfield, Williams running now.
[5243.56 - 5245.56] P:1940.76 E:0.091790 |  Kimmich and Rudiger try and hold up Williams,
[5245.56 - 5247.56] P:1948.17 E:0.095485 |  he comes in between the two, the ball runs away from him,
[5247.56 - 5250.56] P:1901.18 E:0.091673 |  and there is Andric on the edge of the German penalty area,
[5250.56 - 5252.56] P:1897.60 E:0.085439 |  and Germany are back in possession,
[5252.56 - 5254.56] P:1908.28 E:0.084213 |  and Havertz, just outside the centre-circle,
[5254.56 - 5257.56] P:1882.94 E:0.077796 |  leaves it now for Wirtz,
[5257.56 - 5260.56] P:1895.34 E:0.088214 |  passes the ball to Middelstadt on this near side, the left,
[5260.56 - 5263.56] P:1846.07 E:0.087362 |  and then goes to the left corner of the left wingfield,
[5263.56 - 5265.56] P:1880.77 E:0.078248 |  to Mussiala, Wirtz has continued the run,
[5265.56 - 5267.56] P:1870.57 E:0.097097 |  left corner of the area, enters the box,
[5267.56 - 5269.56] P:1835.37 E:0.086747 |  but surrounded by the red shirt,
[5269.56 - 5271.56] P:1896.27 E:0.083770 |  that's what I was talking about, that work ethic,
[5271.56 - 5274.56] P:1878.47 E:0.101441 |  as the cross comes in, Havertz tries to get his head onto it,
[5274.56 - 5276.56] P:1802.57 E:0.102775 |  this is Falkrup, can't turn, Andric places it,
[5276.56 - 5279.56] P:1850.68 E:0.113770 |  great save by Simon, back out towards Havertz,
[5279.56 - 5281.56] P:1911.52 E:0.114685 |  they appeal for handball, Simon dives on the ball,
[5281.56 - 5283.56] P:1941.40 E:0.117143 |  and Spain still lead by Goulton Hill.
[5283.56 - 5285.56] P:1955.26 E:0.114260 |  Just behind that goal,
[5285.56 - 5288.56] P:2007.61 E:0.108911 |  every one of those German fans are screaming for the handball,
[5288.56 - 5291.56] P:2004.67 E:0.098990 |  something that the referee hasn't spotted,
[5291.56 - 5293.56] P:1965.28 E:0.117325 |  and we've just seen a little bit of a freeze frame,
[5293.56 - 5295.56] P:1955.79 E:0.104308 |  I can't see much in that so far,
[5295.56 - 5298.56] P:2003.85 E:0.114328 |  there may have actually been an argument for an offside,
[5298.56 - 5300.56] P:2107.78 E:0.103387 |  and a build up to that play, it did,
[5300.56 - 5303.56] P:2069.55 E:0.097752 |  definitely hit Cucarilla's hand,
[5303.56 - 5305.56] P:2050.79 E:0.097655 |  and his hand was out slightly,
[5305.56 - 5307.56] P:1991.64 E:0.088287 |  so we'll be having a look at that.
[5307.56 - 5311.56] P:1974.57 E:0.073151 |  At the minute there is no appearance on our little monitor
[5311.56 - 5314.56] P:1984.36 E:0.100574 |  that would suggest that VAR are doing so,
[5314.56 - 5317.56] P:1910.56 E:0.087910 |  of course Stuart Atwell is the VAR,
[5317.56 - 5320.56] P:1897.22 E:0.071387 |  well I say that they check everything, don't they?
[5320.56 - 5323.56] P:1730.89 E:0.087320 |  Yeah, but the hand wasn't high,
[5323.56 - 5325.56] P:1797.57 E:0.090327 |  it was lowered down by his knee,
[5325.56 - 5327.56] P:1665.30 E:0.083736 |  but it was out from his knee,
[5327.56 - 5329.56] P:1715.94 E:0.089485 |  and it's certainly, as far as I can see from the replay,
[5329.56 - 5332.56] P:1734.67 E:0.073349 |  caught Cucarilla's hand, and it was in the box.
[5332.56 - 5335.56] P:1860.00 E:0.088468 |  The point being is that they will have dismissed that check
[5335.56 - 5339.56] P:1849.03 E:0.085346 |  very, very quickly, as Fabian out towards that far side,
[5339.56 - 5342.56] P:1764.40 E:0.086212 |  20 minutes remain, nevertheless, what a save by Simon.
[5342.56 - 5345.56] P:1695.97 E:0.085593 |  Yep, he's actually been fantastic,
[5345.56 - 5347.56] P:1952.74 E:0.100386 |  and this game not just with the saves,
[5347.56 - 5350.56] P:2039.40 E:0.100780 |  but also with his distribution, he's been really, really special.
[5350.56 - 5353.56] P:2054.52 E:0.088896 |  By the way, talking about hand balls from the balls crossed in,
[5353.56 - 5355.56] P:1853.15 E:0.078544 |  and the hand's just a little bit out the side,
[5355.56 - 5357.56] P:1869.35 E:0.094230 |  Denmark against Germany?
[5357.56 - 5358.56] P:1951.99 E:0.057603 |  Yes.
[5358.56 - 5362.56] P:1779.72 E:0.079115 |  Certainly the Germans have got lucky with that already in this tournament.
[5362.56 - 5367.56] P:1802.12 E:0.079444 |  Remember, no opposition player is yet to score against Spain,
[5367.56 - 5370.56] P:1948.74 E:0.088760 |  it was a Normand-owned goal against Georgia,
[5370.56 - 5372.56] P:1916.40 E:0.107617 |  but they've been impressed going forward,
[5372.56 - 5377.56] P:1953.43 E:0.083976 |  they've been equally impressive in defence as Andric forward.
[5377.56 - 5380.56] P:1976.10 E:0.098872 |  19 minutes remain, five live and BBC sounds.
[5380.56 - 5384.56] P:1895.50 E:0.066946 |  Portugal, France, commentary to come from eight in Hamburg,
[5384.56 - 5386.56] P:1759.10 E:0.074414 |  with Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton.
[5386.56 - 5389.56] P:1694.51 E:0.088741 |  It'll flick down the line, right side of the penalty area,
[5389.56 - 5393.56] P:1836.84 E:0.081120 |  Wirtz back with Kimmich in field, Rudiger, first time cross,
[5393.56 - 5395.56] P:1960.67 E:0.107702 |  into the penalty area, Falkeruk sees it, Havertz,
[5395.56 - 5399.56] P:1868.81 E:0.092274 |  Havertz, great block by Carvajal, blocks the left-footed shot,
[5399.56 - 5402.56] P:1880.45 E:0.073866 |  knocking at the door, edge of the area, Middleshaw, waits.
[5402.56 - 5405.56] P:1820.25 E:0.087077 |  A wall of red though, Middleshaw has to pass the ball back inside,
[5405.56 - 5408.56] P:1896.92 E:0.088392 |  Tar floats it forward, Cucarrea tucked in,
[5408.56 - 5411.56] P:1769.29 E:0.091944 |  directs his header intelligently out towards Williams,
[5411.56 - 5413.56] P:1874.84 E:0.090810 |  who passes the ball towards Fabian,
[5413.56 - 5417.56] P:1774.44 E:0.086755 |  and Spain will do very, very well to bring this clear,
[5417.56 - 5420.56] P:1992.93 E:0.095274 |  as though Cucarrea has just shown too much towards Kimmich,
[5420.56 - 5425.56] P:1951.10 E:0.078210 |  and they've given the ball away as a result, with 18 minutes remaining.
[5425.56 - 5429.56] P:1740.27 E:0.087613 |  And in the city, which is known as the cradle of the automobile,
[5429.56 - 5433.56] P:1753.82 E:0.092715 |  Germany are looking to go through the gears in these closing stages,
[5433.56 - 5437.56] P:1810.43 E:0.089722 |  as the cross comes in, and Falkeruk's header back down,
[5437.56 - 5439.56] P:1856.20 E:0.087670 |  where it came from, is well off target,
[5439.56 - 5443.56] P:1929.83 E:0.088639 |  and out it goes for a goal kick, and Spain still lead 1-0.
[5443.56 - 5446.56] P:1841.08 E:0.104110 |  They still lead, but they're not getting out as much, are they?
[5446.56 - 5448.56] P:1938.41 E:0.093561 |  They're not being able to control the play,
[5448.56 - 5450.56] P:2042.97 E:0.103035 |  and in possession of the Germans have managed to get in this game
[5450.56 - 5453.56] P:1981.71 E:0.092651 |  so far, it's been pretty special, particularly in the second half,
[5453.56 - 5455.56] P:1916.84 E:0.086031 |  since they've lost the goal. Understandably,
[5455.56 - 5458.56] P:1919.88 E:0.090940 |  they've got everything to lose, so they need to go for it.
[5458.56 - 5461.56] P:1967.42 E:0.080196 |  What has impressed me is, they've actually changed the system
[5461.56 - 5462.56] P:1935.87 E:0.093034 |  two or three times.
[5462.56 - 5464.56] P:1957.61 E:0.070243 |  I've got Moussiala, who's...
[5464.56 - 5466.56] P:1841.47 E:0.087684 |  He's coming up, and he's trying to help me,
[5466.56 - 5468.56] P:1709.85 E:0.094390 |  and Berks is going a wee bit more central,
[5468.56 - 5471.56] P:1844.80 E:0.080504 |  but the play between the strikers has been very good.
[5471.56 - 5473.56] P:1927.75 E:0.095861 |  Falkeruk holds the ball up, lays it up towards Havards.
[5473.56 - 5476.56] P:1839.00 E:0.106465 |  Moussiala is to his left, he couldn't release the ball.
[5476.56 - 5478.56] P:1841.31 E:0.086171 |  Rodri has been superb.
[5478.56 - 5481.56] P:1867.21 E:0.108519 |  Rodri once again passes the ball now towards Ferran Torres.
[5481.56 - 5484.56] P:1944.62 E:0.100547 |  Ferran Torres will get there before Middleshaw, right-hand side.
[5484.56 - 5486.56] P:1853.20 E:0.100454 |  Middleshaw now dives in. Does he get the ball?
[5486.56 - 5490.56] P:1876.66 E:0.113724 |  No, says the referee, and Middleshaw is so annoyed
[5490.56 - 5492.56] P:1990.81 E:0.103620 |  with that decision from the English official.
[5492.56 - 5494.56] P:2048.53 E:0.105059 |  He might well have talked himself into the book,
[5494.56 - 5497.56] P:1998.51 E:0.102337 |  and Middleshaw is on a yellow card,
[5497.56 - 5501.56] P:1985.11 E:0.081588 |  and he too would miss a semi-final.
[5501.56 - 5504.56] P:1844.96 E:0.099941 |  It's a madness. I don't think he talked himself in there.
[5504.56 - 5506.56] P:1918.06 E:0.070914 |  I think he kicked the ball away.
[5506.56 - 5509.56] P:1843.75 E:0.102897 |  And that's a madness, to kick the ball away in Tokyo,
[5509.56 - 5512.56] P:1884.73 E:0.092405 |  you don't have to say anything for that one minute of stupidity.
[5512.56 - 5515.56] P:1891.93 E:0.081648 |  No, it's a harsh, it is a harsh free kick,
[5515.56 - 5517.56] P:1764.60 E:0.090127 |  but he didn't get the ball, and he touched the player,
[5517.56 - 5519.56] P:1871.33 E:0.075153 |  and he shoved him over.
[5519.56 - 5522.56] P:1766.83 E:0.103540 |  He can't do that. It's madness, absolute madness.
[5522.56 - 5525.56] P:1785.20 E:0.099289 |  By the way, is that where the free kick actually happened?
[5525.56 - 5527.56] P:1746.73 E:0.090501 |  It looks to me they've moved down a few yards.
[5527.56 - 5529.56] P:1751.67 E:0.082455 |  I've got to say, I thought it was a lot closer to the touch line.
[5529.56 - 5530.56] P:1782.12 E:0.113969 |  So did I.
[5530.56 - 5531.56] P:1874.37 E:0.055839 |  I agree with you, Pat.
[5531.56 - 5534.56] P:1970.82 E:0.084634 |  Ferran Torres to take it, but should Germany come from behind,
[5534.56 - 5536.56] P:1859.06 E:0.090734 |  they're currently trailing 1-0,
[5536.56 - 5539.56] P:1926.93 E:0.090356 |  and Rick, Middelstadt and Rudiger would all miss a semi-final.
[5539.56 - 5542.56] P:1980.47 E:0.088130 |  She was picking up a yellow card in this quarter-final,
[5542.56 - 5545.56] P:2005.82 E:0.085990 |  that they trailed by a goal to 0 with 16 minutes remaining.
[5545.56 - 5549.56] P:1938.77 E:0.084249 |  Ferran Torres then, just a few yards away from the right corner of the penalty area.
[5549.56 - 5554.56] P:1982.66 E:0.073736 |  Just wipes his chin with his left arm, swings it,
[5554.56 - 5555.56] P:1911.61 E:0.112863 |  towards the far post,
[5555.56 - 5558.56] P:1975.93 E:0.083538 |  kept him played by LePorte at that far post,
[5558.56 - 5560.56] P:1857.12 E:0.079275 |  and then maybe Germany can break.
[5560.56 - 5562.56] P:1991.75 E:0.082087 |  Mussiala held it all.
[5562.56 - 5565.56] P:1961.24 E:0.115525 |  That was a rugby tackle by Ferran Torres.
[5565.56 - 5567.56] P:1961.21 E:0.108404 |  He had no attempt to play the ball.
[5567.56 - 5569.56] P:1930.12 E:0.108135 |  He tried to bring him down by the shoulders.
[5569.56 - 5571.56] P:1956.26 E:0.092121 |  Something you'd see in the rugby union test tomorrow.
[5571.56 - 5575.56] P:1841.63 E:0.092516 |  That's one of the most ridiculous tackles I've seen in this tour.
[5575.56 - 5578.56] P:1665.50 E:0.087861 |  No, that is the most ridiculous tackle.
[5578.56 - 5579.56] P:1838.31 E:0.083831 |  It is a rugby tackle.
[5579.56 - 5583.56] P:1902.28 E:0.095239 |  It's one of those ones that's so cynical you just wonder,
[5583.56 - 5584.56] P:1986.73 E:0.097592 |  should it be worse than a yellow?
[5584.56 - 5586.56] P:1812.74 E:0.101533 |  Anyway, he's got away with the yellow.
[5586.56 - 5589.56] P:1939.16 E:0.096127 |  Rudiger goes with a searching diagonal ball.
[5589.56 - 5592.56] P:1910.83 E:0.086212 |  Just over a quarter of an hour remains here in Stuttgart,
[5592.56 - 5595.56] P:2037.43 E:0.098201 |  Spain leads Germany by a goal to nil.
[5598.56 - 5601.56] P:1838.64 E:0.082487 |  Fabian to Williams, running at pace,
[5601.56 - 5604.56] P:1846.63 E:0.091048 |  in from that left touch line, plays the ball behind to Marata.
[5604.56 - 5605.56] P:1975.46 E:0.079038 |  Marata goes square.
[5605.56 - 5608.56] P:1967.55 E:0.093498 |  Ferran Torres now, midway through the Germany half.
[5608.56 - 5611.56] P:1865.48 E:0.064776 |  Roderick just slows it down,
[5611.56 - 5613.56] P:1808.65 E:0.085255 |  calms everything down for Spain.
[5613.56 - 5614.56] P:1824.80 E:0.095216 |  Carvajal joins the attack.
[5614.56 - 5617.56] P:1944.36 E:0.086375 |  Ferran Torres, Spain keeping the ball.
[5617.56 - 5620.56] P:1927.14 E:0.087898 |  They're just shading it in terms of possession.
[5620.56 - 5623.56] P:1872.94 E:0.102119 |  53% Moussiala and Carvajal.
[5623.56 - 5625.56] P:1839.91 E:0.094564 |  Last touch game of Carvajal.
[5625.56 - 5628.56] P:1928.55 E:0.097728 |  It'll be a Germany throw on the halfway line.
[5628.56 - 5630.56] P:1892.14 E:0.076446 |  Not Carvajal's best moment, is it?
[5630.56 - 5631.56] P:1731.17 E:0.098690 |  I mean, he's got the ball.
[5631.56 - 5633.56] P:1544.65 E:0.094265 |  He's got lots of options ahead of him.
[5633.56 - 5635.56] P:1673.54 E:0.079011 |  He tries a little dribble, completely enough to lose.
[5635.56 - 5637.56] P:1768.26 E:0.100139 |  It gives possession away.
[5637.56 - 5639.56] P:1814.06 E:0.101065 |  And considering it's so hard at the moment for the Spanish
[5639.56 - 5641.56] P:1872.40 E:0.079052 |  to get possession, I don't think his friends
[5641.56 - 5643.56] P:1772.05 E:0.100619 |  are going to thank him for that.
[5643.56 - 5644.56] P:1941.53 E:0.091459 |  Or should that be Amigos?
[5644.56 - 5647.56] P:1893.79 E:0.102395 |  It hasn't been the classic we were expecting, has it?
[5647.56 - 5648.56] P:1774.76 E:0.094576 |  No, but it's tense.
[5648.56 - 5651.56] P:1805.00 E:0.100255 |  I mean, as you're going to get that, sometimes it's like that.
[5651.56 - 5653.56] P:1866.29 E:0.092194 |  There's a lot of good players out in the show.
[5653.56 - 5655.56] P:1893.24 E:0.089490 |  There have been moments that have been very, very good.
[5655.56 - 5658.56] P:1764.26 E:0.093345 |  Technically, it's been an interesting game tactically as well.
[5658.56 - 5660.56] P:1879.29 E:0.064148 |  Millions and millions of chances?
[5660.56 - 5662.56] P:1622.94 E:0.064823 |  No, it has not been that. I'll grant you that.
[5662.56 - 5665.56] P:1779.44 E:0.075403 |  Here is Tar, left of the centre circle.
[5665.56 - 5668.56] P:1829.04 E:0.083153 |  Fulcruxis, a target along the ground,
[5668.56 - 5671.56] P:1795.96 E:0.097839 |  back towards Moussiala, stooping head of by Carvajal
[5671.56 - 5672.56] P:1734.57 E:0.080907 |  and gathered in by Seymour.
[5672.56 - 5673.56] P:1721.45 E:0.089153 |  Ian Carter at Wimbledon.
[5673.56 - 5676.56] P:1830.78 E:0.092792 |  First set, Emma Radikano against Maria Sacri
[5676.56 - 5677.56] P:1868.71 E:0.091483 |  of Greece.
[5677.56 - 5679.56] P:1926.01 E:0.091174 |  A double break came in the seventh game,
[5679.56 - 5683.56] P:1916.97 E:0.092707 |  courtesy of a stunning lob right onto the baseline.
[5683.56 - 5686.56] P:1920.87 E:0.090477 |  A tortuous game to serve it out, two break points saved,
[5686.56 - 5691.56] P:1829.84 E:0.084773 |  and Radikano gets the first set by six games to two.
[5691.56 - 5694.56] P:1670.52 E:0.056548 |  Commentary continues on Sports Extra.
[5694.56 - 5697.56] P:1904.44 E:0.087978 |  Middleshap with the back pass to Neuer.
[5697.56 - 5700.56] P:1964.03 E:0.079423 |  Neuer passes it right-footed to Rudiger.
[5700.56 - 5703.56] P:1944.42 E:0.093678 |  Kimmick has stayed quite high on that far side,
[5703.56 - 5705.56] P:1752.45 E:0.096975 |  and here he is, over the halfway line.
[5705.56 - 5708.56] P:1795.56 E:0.100700 |  He looks for the run a verge round the back of Kukerea.
[5708.56 - 5710.56] P:1934.83 E:0.111912 |  Fulcrux is the post!
[5710.56 - 5713.56] P:1934.75 E:0.112259 |  Fulcrux, who was falling down to the ground right-footed,
[5713.56 - 5715.56] P:1910.79 E:0.094527 |  hits the base of the right-hand post,
[5715.56 - 5717.56] P:2002.64 E:0.097428 |  and Germany comes so close to an equaliser.
[5717.56 - 5719.56] P:1891.28 E:0.077993 |  Fabulous, fabulous break there.
[5719.56 - 5721.56] P:1655.23 E:0.109337 |  The pace of that was incredible there,
[5721.56 - 5723.56] P:1951.18 E:0.091836 |  but that's so full, Krux, isn't it?
[5723.56 - 5725.56] P:1842.47 E:0.094618 |  It looks like there's nothing on, no chance at all.
[5725.56 - 5728.56] P:1899.19 E:0.100623 |  You're right, he's falling, the ball zipped across him,
[5728.56 - 5731.56] P:1848.60 E:0.095723 |  but he somehow manages to get enough power on it,
[5731.56 - 5734.56] P:1815.35 E:0.094181 |  and Simon Krux would have done nothing about it,
[5734.56 - 5736.56] P:1890.71 E:0.075971 |  saved by the post.
[5736.56 - 5739.56] P:1952.49 E:0.100628 |  First time that they've got round the back of Kukerea.
[5739.56 - 5741.56] P:1885.72 E:0.108187 |  Yep, and he's done really well so far,
[5741.56 - 5743.56] P:1882.30 E:0.104176 |  but he can put under pressure by a whole bunch of them,
[5743.56 - 5746.56] P:1934.06 E:0.101524 |  and they're looking at the German bench now,
[5746.56 - 5749.56] P:1854.19 E:0.105752 |  and they're all up, trying to get the fans to lift the team.
[5749.56 - 5751.56] P:1820.26 E:0.108073 |  They're whipping up the crowd,
[5751.56 - 5754.56] P:1792.17 E:0.098994 |  and the crowd responds inside this arena
[5754.56 - 5757.56] P:1821.03 E:0.106383 |  that holds 54,000 here in Stuttgart.
[5757.56 - 5759.56] P:1773.42 E:0.093010 |  13 minutes remaining.
[5759.56 - 5761.56] P:1816.42 E:0.116196 |  Otherwise, Germany, the host nation,
[5761.56 - 5763.56] P:1861.96 E:0.099435 |  are going out in the last eights.
[5765.56 - 5768.56] P:1870.05 E:0.105597 |  Here is Rudiger, forward ball to Vox.
[5768.56 - 5773.56] P:1803.08 E:0.077038 |  Spain are going to make a double change.
[5773.56 - 5775.56] P:1909.88 E:0.098898 |  Moreno is going to be coming on,
[5775.56 - 5778.56] P:1865.38 E:0.078620 |  and I think Oya Sabel is the other player
[5778.56 - 5781.56] P:1734.25 E:0.094000 |  who's going to be coming on as well.
[5781.56 - 5786.56] P:1817.58 E:0.064746 |  Two players who have been loyal servants to Luis de la Fuente
[5786.56 - 5789.56] P:1863.85 E:0.093797 |  for the success that he's had with the Spanish youth sides
[5789.56 - 5791.56] P:1862.02 E:0.086537 |  in his career.
[5792.56 - 5795.56] P:1816.01 E:0.099844 |  It's been tough for them hasn't it?
[5795.56 - 5798.56] P:1906.41 E:0.100654 |  They're not used to chasing the Spanish.
[5798.56 - 5801.56] P:1854.58 E:0.104178 |  They're used to holding the ball, controlling the pace against,
[5801.56 - 5803.56] P:1813.86 E:0.099497 |  having lots of possession.
[5803.56 - 5805.56] P:1816.16 E:0.097858 |  They've not had much, they scored that goal.
[5805.56 - 5807.56] P:1966.13 E:0.085792 |  Kimmich with a cut back right-hand side,
[5807.56 - 5809.56] P:1967.38 E:0.098931 |  falls to Virts.
[5809.56 - 5811.56] P:1829.08 E:0.107770 |  Virts can't get the shot away,
[5811.56 - 5813.56] P:1938.20 E:0.076251 |  and in the end it's just cleared long.
[5814.56 - 5816.56] P:1899.54 E:0.092195 |  By Fabian, Neuer is the one,
[5816.56 - 5818.56] P:1955.44 E:0.104362 |  the sweeper-keeper comes almost to the halfway line,
[5818.56 - 5820.56] P:1825.69 E:0.102246 |  but he puts it out of play for a throw.
[5820.56 - 5822.56] P:1708.50 E:0.097407 |  Didn't he once do that before and make a big mistake?
[5822.56 - 5824.56] P:1809.34 E:0.080334 |  I think some time ago.
[5824.56 - 5826.56] P:1813.09 E:0.094166 |  But he'll make those changes now,
[5826.56 - 5828.56] P:1769.75 E:0.088096 |  and you understand why, very, very tiring
[5828.56 - 5830.56] P:1673.19 E:0.094405 |  for a number of those players, particularly in the midfield,
[5830.56 - 5832.56] P:1830.68 E:0.088767 |  for the Spanish at the moment,
[5832.56 - 5834.56] P:1906.86 E:0.087454 |  so he's going to try and make changes.
[5834.56 - 5836.56] P:1821.77 E:0.103253 |  He'll give a little bit more energy than they have.
[5836.56 - 5840.56] P:1855.28 E:0.099172 |  For most of the game, the Spanish with a more energetic side,
[5840.56 - 5843.56] P:1831.18 E:0.092625 |  but it hasn't been that for about 15 minutes.
[5843.56 - 5846.56] P:1827.04 E:0.101519 |  11 minutes remaining, a lot of liquid refreshment
[5846.56 - 5849.56] P:1899.60 E:0.087456 |  is being taken on board, on this.
[5850.56 - 5852.56] P:1884.93 E:0.109277 |  Sultry Nights in Stuttgart.
[5852.56 - 5855.56] P:1822.19 E:0.094257 |  Williams is the player who's going to be coming off.
[5856.56 - 5859.56] P:1903.41 E:0.104591 |  And we're also going to see Maratta coming off, so...
[5859.56 - 5862.56] P:1895.46 E:0.099687 |  Oya Saval will replace Alvaro Maratta,
[5862.56 - 5866.56] P:1952.58 E:0.094771 |  the Real Sociedad striker, has appeared now in every game.
[5866.56 - 5868.56] P:1826.87 E:0.090523 |  This is his fourth appearance off the bench.
[5868.56 - 5870.56] P:1836.40 E:0.080358 |  He did start against Albania,
[5870.56 - 5872.56] P:1879.00 E:0.106522 |  and Nico Williams for Mika Moreno,
[5872.56 - 5875.56] P:1941.58 E:0.096974 |  the former Newcastle United player, also coming on.
[5875.56 - 5877.56] P:2036.09 E:0.101231 |  And taking their time as well,
[5877.56 - 5880.56] P:2048.68 E:0.101481 |  much to the annoyance of the German supporters,
[5880.56 - 5882.56] P:2137.54 E:0.091931 |  less so the German players,
[5882.56 - 5884.56] P:2084.60 E:0.097878 |  who are getting instructions from Nagelsmann
[5884.56 - 5886.56] P:1873.10 E:0.093619 |  and a lot of liquid refreshment.
[5886.56 - 5888.56] P:1563.46 E:0.098729 |  Yeah, they've got real belief in themselves.
[5888.56 - 5891.56] P:1696.46 E:0.085954 |  You're looking at the German team down there, on the bench down there,
[5891.56 - 5893.56] P:1732.78 E:0.093981 |  they still don't look panic to me.
[5893.56 - 5895.56] P:1550.31 E:0.077372 |  They're a team that seems to believe,
[5895.56 - 5897.56] P:1615.66 E:0.092180 |  no, we're going to make chances.
[5897.56 - 5899.56] P:1884.36 E:0.102594 |  We'll get a few more. Before the end of the game,
[5899.56 - 5901.56] P:1916.68 E:0.079866 |  there will be a little chance,
[5901.56 - 5903.56] P:1768.94 E:0.107371 |  now and again, and all the Germans again,
[5903.56 - 5905.56] P:1921.49 E:0.107024 |  another substitution,
[5905.56 - 5908.56] P:1890.83 E:0.106821 |  to be a really going for it just now.
[5908.56 - 5911.56] P:1978.63 E:0.110759 |  Would there be a more popular goal scorer
[5911.56 - 5913.56] P:1817.91 E:0.107981 |  to get an equaliser than Thomas Muller?
[5913.56 - 5916.56] P:1901.80 E:0.095284 |  He's never scored at the Euros.
[5916.56 - 5922.56] P:1797.21 E:0.100978 |  He only has made one appearance in this European Championship,
[5922.56 - 5925.56] P:1951.80 E:0.094709 |  and that was against Scotland for the final 16 minutes.
[5927.56 - 5930.56] P:1735.88 E:0.099581 |  Let's try to see if there's a tie that came off from there.
[5930.56 - 5932.56] P:1819.38 E:0.085321 |  Wow, you're going seriously positive.
[5932.56 - 5935.56] P:1871.40 E:0.090113 |  Here is Fabian. Fabian to Oya Sabal, couldn't get there.
[5935.56 - 5938.56] P:1851.17 E:0.091689 |  It might come out to Ferran Torres, attempted clearance blocked,
[5938.56 - 5940.56] P:1778.00 E:0.086664 |  comes towards Moreno, Moreno, plays it out,
[5940.56 - 5943.56] P:1866.48 E:0.098869 |  and over the head of Olmo, and out it goes for a throw.
[5943.56 - 5945.56] P:1914.28 E:0.111597 |  I'll be intrigued to see what the Germans are doing now.
[5945.56 - 5948.56] P:1886.78 E:0.094192 |  It looks to me that they're putting Andric back there,
[5948.56 - 5951.56] P:1801.03 E:0.096329 |  along centre-back, alongside Tony Rudiger,
[5951.56 - 5953.56] P:1687.69 E:0.091810 |  that's given Muller a chance to go in,
[5953.56 - 5955.56] P:1696.92 E:0.103154 |  and what an attacking look inside the Germans on now.
[5955.56 - 5959.56] P:1835.95 E:0.108969 |  And Havards picks it up, and he drives forward over on that right-hand side,
[5959.56 - 5961.56] P:1891.79 E:0.090152 |  passes the ball up towards Muller,
[5961.56 - 5963.56] P:1907.29 E:0.092596 |  but just coming across his nacho,
[5963.56 - 5966.56] P:1824.37 E:0.089485 |  all with his experience, the Real Madrid defender.
[5966.56 - 5969.56] P:1929.34 E:0.097288 |  Cucarero gives the ball away, straight towards Andric,
[5969.56 - 5972.56] P:1878.20 E:0.091535 |  nine minutes remaining, Kroos to full group, backs a goal,
[5972.56 - 5976.56] P:1869.90 E:0.093725 |  turns, plays Mussi-Alarin, inside the penalty area, inside left channel,
[5976.56 - 5979.56] P:1908.29 E:0.095613 |  shoots left footed, off target, goal kick, Spain still lead 1-0.
[5979.56 - 5982.56] P:1871.20 E:0.093471 |  Yeah, it's good tactic with Aubain, I go to Sven,
[5982.56 - 5984.56] P:1774.23 E:0.105429 |  he's asked a lot of different questions,
[5984.56 - 5986.56] P:1896.29 E:0.090397 |  and the team that he's playing just now, the way they're playing,
[5986.56 - 5989.56] P:1943.22 E:0.102170 |  they're trying to push you up almost like a 2-3-5.
[5989.56 - 5992.56] P:1966.47 E:0.092793 |  Now, if anybody who's a certain age will remember,
[5992.56 - 5996.56] P:2036.62 E:0.104402 |  that's decades and decades and decades of goals,
[5996.56 - 5997.56] P:2050.22 E:0.096878 |  and that's played there.
[5997.56 - 5999.56] P:2008.98 E:0.100371 |  Rudiger's having to go out to the right-hand side there.
[5999.56 - 6001.56] P:2026.84 E:0.100670 |  In Spanish team, they're trying to do,
[6001.56 - 6003.56] P:1871.69 E:0.089912 |  and what they're doing is they're putting their wingers to go,
[6003.56 - 6004.56] P:1890.95 E:0.098710 |  it's way responsible.
[6004.56 - 6008.56] P:1945.97 E:0.102426 |  Two good coaches, they're asking lots of different questions,
[6008.56 - 6009.56] P:2014.38 E:0.086374 |  and they shall...
[6009.56 - 6012.56] P:1947.20 E:0.095231 |  That's the voice of Pat Nevin on five live,
[6012.56 - 6017.56] P:1957.12 E:0.096060 |  as Ulai Semon has been shown a yellow card for time-wasting
[6017.56 - 6020.56] P:1929.42 E:0.077277 |  by referee Anthony Taylor.
[6020.56 - 6023.56] P:1781.28 E:0.091957 |  Don't think he can get out good, but not too much there.
[6023.56 - 6025.56] P:1723.11 E:0.098982 |  And right behind them, everyone of those Germans,
[6025.56 - 6027.56] P:1914.13 E:0.102916 |  finds well-lit an Antinitello Norbeau.
[6027.56 - 6030.56] P:2091.37 E:0.108597 |  By the way, Antinitello's had a much better second half.
[6030.56 - 6031.56] P:2093.67 E:0.119123 |  Think he's ready for...
[6031.56 - 6034.56] P:2142.14 E:0.107668 |  Not been in the mistakes in his second half, so he's done well.
[6034.56 - 6038.56] P:2108.40 E:0.099898 |  It's the eighth yellow card that has been shown by Anthony Taylor.
[6038.56 - 6041.56] P:1913.38 E:0.088267 |  Semon with a clearance, wasn't the best.
[6041.56 - 6044.56] P:1967.24 E:0.115607 |  Strikes the legs of the court, falls towards Havertz.
[6044.56 - 6046.56] P:1813.06 E:0.107475 |  Havertz with a chip! Just over the top!
[6046.56 - 6048.56] P:1849.48 E:0.111106 |  Semon was off his goal line,
[6048.56 - 6052.56] P:1839.70 E:0.100715 |  and Havertz went mightily close for a German equaliser.
[6052.56 - 6054.56] P:1827.42 E:0.074771 |  He should get it on target.
[6054.56 - 6055.56] P:1825.80 E:0.106727 |  He really should.
[6055.56 - 6059.56] P:1942.31 E:0.094735 |  Semon, terrible goal kick, and then comes out when he shouldn't.
[6059.56 - 6062.56] P:1856.43 E:0.101463 |  And he leaves himself completely in no-man's land there,
[6062.56 - 6065.56] P:2004.78 E:0.094500 |  balls dinked over the top, Havertz knows.
[6065.56 - 6067.56] P:2045.73 E:0.114491 |  He's tried to give it a little bit more,
[6067.56 - 6069.56] P:2044.06 E:0.112070 |  because he knows Semon's a big tall goalkeeper.
[6069.56 - 6072.56] P:2074.39 E:0.109362 |  He should get that on target.
[6072.56 - 6075.56] P:2010.85 E:0.109544 |  Ulai Semon testing the patience of the German crowd.
[6075.56 - 6079.56] P:2040.34 E:0.101919 |  He's just been booked. He has to be careful.
[6079.56 - 6082.56] P:1954.24 E:0.074411 |  Clearance downfield, headed on by Moreno,
[6082.56 - 6085.56] P:1811.47 E:0.082344 |  headed back by Middelstadt to Manuel Neuer.
[6085.56 - 6089.56] P:1935.98 E:0.093650 |  By my watch, we have seven minutes remaining of normal time.
[6089.56 - 6092.56] P:1882.73 E:0.091608 |  Germany looking for a late equaliser,
[6092.56 - 6097.56] P:1856.84 E:0.087277 |  just as they did when they met back last time at the World Cup.
[6097.56 - 6099.56] P:1845.61 E:0.090467 |  It was around now that that man Falkirk scored,
[6099.56 - 6101.56] P:1737.76 E:0.106577 |  but this occasion, he gives it away.
[6102.56 - 6105.56] P:1753.40 E:0.087402 |  And the ball is played forward by Le Port.
[6105.56 - 6109.56] P:1833.96 E:0.070125 |  And now brought down by Torres to Rodgerie.
[6109.56 - 6112.56] P:1937.67 E:0.098550 |  Foul from Moula on the back of Rodgerie.
[6112.56 - 6114.56] P:1979.47 E:0.087163 |  Free kick to Spain inside the centre-circle.
[6114.56 - 6118.56] P:1792.93 E:0.092302 |  It's a fury, and for Moula, for all his talents,
[6118.56 - 6120.56] P:1929.71 E:0.075475 |  he's not the pace he's playing the world anymore.
[6120.56 - 6122.56] P:1764.47 E:0.079866 |  And the one chance he's had since he came on,
[6122.56 - 6124.56] P:1713.92 E:0.094155 |  the ball was played far too far in front of him.
[6124.56 - 6127.56] P:1801.87 E:0.072066 |  But you know, it could be the romantic story, couldn't it?
[6127.56 - 6130.56] P:1745.41 E:0.090718 |  That he gets the goal that changes everything for the country.
[6130.56 - 6134.56] P:1897.97 E:0.086264 |  The winners of this will meet the winners of Portugal, France,
[6134.56 - 6137.56] P:1931.42 E:0.092643 |  in the semi-final in Munich on Tuesday.
[6137.56 - 6140.56] P:1789.78 E:0.087379 |  You'll hear that quarter-final tie in Hamburg
[6140.56 - 6142.56] P:1840.91 E:0.091165 |  at 8 o'clock tonight on Five Live.
[6142.56 - 6144.56] P:1986.17 E:0.083661 |  This is Fabian, who shoots edge of the area.
[6144.56 - 6146.56] P:1831.76 E:0.098353 |  It was a wild effort, left footed.
[6146.56 - 6151.56] P:1938.16 E:0.081674 |  He actually had Oya Sabel to his left, who was free.
[6151.56 - 6153.56] P:1804.23 E:0.072626 |  That's the second time he's done it.
[6153.56 - 6155.56] P:1546.23 E:0.113787 |  He's done it in the first half as well.
[6155.56 - 6157.56] P:1878.59 E:0.074769 |  There was an overlap on the left-hand side,
[6157.56 - 6160.56] P:1873.56 E:0.083634 |  and two players, Niko Wilkes, was waiting for it.
[6160.56 - 6163.56] P:1670.85 E:0.097766 |  And it was Monata as well on that occasion.
[6163.56 - 6166.56] P:1699.94 E:0.081177 |  This time, I mean, it's unthinkable we do that,
[6166.56 - 6169.56] P:1806.45 E:0.073341 |  because he's got the vision to see that, so that's a mistake.
[6169.56 - 6174.56] P:1859.05 E:0.072157 |  Spain looking to maintain this winning run.
[6174.56 - 6179.56] P:1830.61 E:0.082701 |  It would be 11 consecutive games in competitive football.
[6179.56 - 6185.56] P:1843.53 E:0.091788 |  It would be their best run actually, since they achieved 14 13 years ago.
[6185.56 - 6188.56] P:1866.15 E:0.102623 |  Rudiger. German crowd though still haven't lost faith.
[6188.56 - 6192.56] P:1976.10 E:0.100370 |  Full group, falling theatrically to the floor,
[6192.56 - 6198.56] P:1936.71 E:0.079033 |  but getting a free kick, some 26 yards out from goal.
[6198.56 - 6200.56] P:1751.24 E:0.098553 |  First of all, it looks a little bit lucky,
[6200.56 - 6202.56] P:1836.06 E:0.072933 |  but Carvajals come in.
[6202.56 - 6204.56] P:1789.08 E:0.098642 |  You would call that a clever little nudge,
[6204.56 - 6207.56] P:1878.80 E:0.085590 |  but it ain't clever if it gives them a free kick.
[6207.56 - 6208.56] P:1819.65 E:0.095558 |  It's about 30 yards out.
[6208.56 - 6209.56] P:1597.60 E:0.094370 |  It looks a little bit too far.
[6209.56 - 6211.56] P:1903.09 E:0.071053 |  It's shoot from there.
[6211.56 - 6212.56] P:1852.51 E:0.092438 |  Gross may think about it,
[6212.56 - 6215.56] P:1777.63 E:0.084465 |  but with a pair that he's got at that back post,
[6215.56 - 6218.56] P:1758.45 E:0.090136 |  you think he's going to get zipped in a lane with the back post,
[6218.56 - 6220.56] P:1917.25 E:0.084033 |  cuddling in towards it for his strikers,
[6220.56 - 6222.56] P:1749.95 E:0.077852 |  and he's sent back to go and attack it.
[6222.56 - 6224.56] P:1757.62 E:0.086025 |  So you're suggesting he's not going to do a Ronaldo?
[6224.56 - 6228.56] P:1755.25 E:0.082327 |  I don't think he's that carried away at the moment.
[6228.56 - 6230.56] P:1938.57 E:0.064714 |  Not quite yet.
[6230.56 - 6233.56] P:1907.71 E:0.097980 |  One big deep breath from Tony Kroos.
[6233.56 - 6235.56] P:1780.33 E:0.104893 |  But you never know, by the way.
[6235.56 - 6237.56] P:1894.41 E:0.097226 |  Well, Mullahs just had a word with him as well.
[6237.56 - 6239.56] P:1945.48 E:0.093467 |  Rudiger is hobbling.
[6239.56 - 6242.56] P:2015.55 E:0.084267 |  He used all of their five substitutes of Germany.
[6242.56 - 6245.56] P:1968.74 E:0.096498 |  It's just under 30 yards out from goal.
[6245.56 - 6246.56] P:1860.00 E:0.064890 |  Five minutes remain.
[6246.56 - 6248.56] P:1985.78 E:0.089329 |  Kroos waits to take it.
[6248.56 - 6250.56] P:1772.47 E:0.095680 |  Kimmich has made the darting run up from the back.
[6250.56 - 6253.56] P:1908.13 E:0.087431 |  Referee, he went to find him too and succeeded,
[6253.56 - 6256.56] P:1917.19 E:0.086775 |  but the referee has called it back much to Kroos' frustration.
[6256.56 - 6259.56] P:1760.30 E:0.084900 |  He did exactly the same for a free kick in the first half
[6259.56 - 6261.56] P:1897.57 E:0.091067 |  when it was Rudiger who went wide.
[6261.56 - 6263.56] P:1827.89 E:0.090368 |  So you can see what we're trying to do there,
[6263.56 - 6267.56] P:1970.44 E:0.081613 |  that the referee's not spotted it and held up the play.
[6267.56 - 6271.56] P:2007.58 E:0.088570 |  Kroos waits, chips it into the penalty area.
[6271.56 - 6275.56] P:1798.11 E:0.086067 |  Havers down with header, turned behind by Seymour.
[6275.56 - 6277.56] P:1917.10 E:0.110062 |  Referee has spotted a bit of pushing.
[6277.56 - 6278.56] P:1888.49 E:0.091644 |  It wouldn't have counted anyway.
[6278.56 - 6279.56] P:1913.91 E:0.088606 |  It'll be a free kick to Spain.
[6279.56 - 6281.56] P:1632.66 E:0.093888 |  Yeah, Havers getting on the end of it.
[6281.56 - 6283.56] P:1755.01 E:0.086826 |  I mean, he's getting himself sent in brilliant positions,
[6283.56 - 6285.56] P:1788.64 E:0.091026 |  but he just cannot do the final thing though.
[6285.56 - 6287.56] P:1890.61 E:0.090336 |  There's a little nudge there.
[6287.56 - 6290.56] P:2039.14 E:0.094934 |  Not a huge amount, but it's enough to put the defender off.
[6290.56 - 6292.56] P:2009.49 E:0.099457 |  The defender in that case was natural.
[6292.56 - 6296.56] P:2034.30 E:0.086007 |  He feels, hands in his back, he's going down.
[6296.56 - 6301.56] P:1975.49 E:0.088915 |  Time is in short supply for Germany here in Stuttgart.
[6301.56 - 6303.56] P:1958.76 E:0.077169 |  Four minutes remain.
[6303.56 - 6304.56] P:1789.75 E:0.072598 |  Unai Seymour.
[6304.56 - 6307.56] P:1772.52 E:0.082430 |  Gain didn't really get much elevation off that clearance,
[6307.56 - 6310.56] P:1818.62 E:0.070298 |  but Olmo touches the ball out to that far side of the left
[6310.56 - 6313.56] P:1832.17 E:0.087342 |  for Kukere, and it'll flick by Olmo.
[6313.56 - 6317.56] P:1908.98 E:0.102628 |  That was Andric who won it forcefully.
[6317.56 - 6319.56] P:1915.68 E:0.111648 |  Havers is released on the left-hand side.
[6319.56 - 6321.56] P:1818.72 E:0.099811 |  Havers looks up, level with the penalty area,
[6321.56 - 6324.56] P:1746.37 E:0.105525 |  sends over the cross, and Carvajal arriving at the far post.
[6324.56 - 6327.56] P:1910.52 E:0.100897 |  Heads it, flying header behind for a corner kick.
[6327.56 - 6329.56] P:1941.60 E:0.100558 |  Germany are putting Spain under pressure.
[6329.56 - 6331.56] P:1808.89 E:0.110064 |  Where have they got the energy from?
[6331.56 - 6334.56] P:1937.02 E:0.093793 |  They didn't look like they had that sort of energy in the first half,
[6334.56 - 6336.56] P:1815.39 E:0.113712 |  but they know they're going to enter this tournament,
[6336.56 - 6338.56] P:1764.48 E:0.105433 |  and they have played really well in the second half
[6338.56 - 6341.56] P:1927.33 E:0.073761 |  since they lost the goal of the Germans.
[6341.56 - 6343.56] P:1946.09 E:0.104693 |  On this muggy evening in Stuttgart,
[6343.56 - 6347.56] P:1895.99 E:0.094765 |  three minutes of normal time remain on five live and BBC sounds.
[6347.56 - 6349.56] P:1914.00 E:0.087730 |  Spain still lead 1-0.
[6349.56 - 6351.56] P:1808.10 E:0.078307 |  You wouldn't put it past them, would you?
[6351.56 - 6353.56] P:1968.38 E:0.065369 |  No, you wouldn't.
[6353.56 - 6356.56] P:1923.52 E:0.086788 |  Kroos rolls it from this near side of the left to Kimmich.
[6356.56 - 6358.56] P:1898.81 E:0.087854 |  Backheels the ball to Kroos.
[6358.56 - 6361.56] P:1932.07 E:0.085271 |  Kroos cuts it back, Mussiala just inside the penalty area.
[6361.56 - 6364.56] P:1914.28 E:0.095977 |  He tees up, middle stat, shot blocked, cleared away,
[6364.56 - 6366.56] P:1928.63 E:0.095222 |  but Olmo anywhere will do for Spain.
[6366.56 - 6368.56] P:1916.35 E:0.092627 |  Out it goes for a throw.
[6368.56 - 6370.56] P:1802.71 E:0.072080 |  They're firmly on the back foot now of Spain.
[6370.56 - 6372.56] P:1753.02 E:0.104186 |  The Lafianse is telling his players to calm down.
[6372.56 - 6373.56] P:1832.47 E:0.091503 |  Yeah, right.
[6373.56 - 6376.56] P:1817.71 E:0.086918 |  Look, chance they're going to get any opportunity to calm down,
[6376.56 - 6378.56] P:1684.10 E:0.098301 |  because they're getting closed down.
[6378.56 - 6380.56] P:1851.36 E:0.100944 |  They're putting under pressure just now,
[6380.56 - 6382.56] P:2007.21 E:0.074348 |  but they're tired.
[6382.56 - 6384.56] P:1946.19 E:0.086155 |  Here is Andriy.
[6384.56 - 6386.56] P:1947.09 E:0.093921 |  Passes the ball out wide.
[6386.56 - 6389.56] P:1938.28 E:0.091026 |  Moula, his diagonal cross from that right-hand side.
[6389.56 - 6391.56] P:1903.25 E:0.097997 |  Full crook touches it on with his head.
[6391.56 - 6393.56] P:1851.63 E:0.103695 |  Mussiala left-hand side of the penalty area.
[6393.56 - 6395.56] P:1948.30 E:0.096828 |  Mussiala can't get a shot of goal.
[6395.56 - 6397.56] P:1887.83 E:0.092479 |  He tries to pull it back to the edge of the area.
[6397.56 - 6399.56] P:1947.87 E:0.095673 |  There's a potential break-on.
[6399.56 - 6401.56] P:1945.26 E:0.083449 |  Oya Sabal is going to give chase.
[6401.56 - 6403.56] P:1805.85 E:0.090310 |  Noya, though, is out of his penalty area, and he'll leave it.
[6403.56 - 6406.56] P:1914.85 E:0.098411 |  And Noya will take the throw, and he takes it quickly
[6406.56 - 6408.56] P:1918.24 E:0.102512 |  and plays it down this near side to Middleship
[6408.56 - 6410.56] P:1904.28 E:0.092686 |  and then the halfway line.
[6410.56 - 6412.56] P:1978.88 E:0.089632 |  The left back finds Kroos.
[6412.56 - 6414.56] P:1936.83 E:0.088289 |  Spain are desperate to get every red shirt back behind the ball.
[6414.56 - 6416.56] P:1819.94 E:0.082209 |  Kroos floats it out towards the right.
[6416.56 - 6418.56] P:1870.71 E:0.062156 |  Moula controls it, waits.
[6418.56 - 6420.56] P:1828.08 E:0.077764 |  Still, they're not panicking, but there is that...
[6420.56 - 6422.56] P:1939.18 E:0.103354 |  a degree of urgency.
[6422.56 - 6424.56] P:1959.89 E:0.081647 |  Of course there is. It's Rudiger.
[6424.56 - 6426.56] P:1814.19 E:0.097736 |  But there's a structure about their play.
[6426.56 - 6428.56] P:1963.64 E:0.080789 |  In comes the cross, bounces off the chest of Havertz.
[6428.56 - 6430.56] P:2014.04 E:0.077720 |  Vertz touches it.
[6430.56 - 6432.56] P:1960.34 E:0.098240 |  Kroos works it out towards the left.
[6432.56 - 6434.56] P:1944.04 E:0.099004 |  Middleship out with a cross, queuing over the far post.
[6434.56 - 6436.56] P:1875.26 E:0.112484 |  Kimmick is there, down into the ground.
[6436.56 - 6438.56] P:1976.87 E:0.115091 |  And then, the goal is to convert the goal.
[6438.56 - 6440.56] P:1789.23 E:0.124580 |  And it's coming.
[6440.56 - 6442.56] P:1920.21 E:0.107733 |  Junior arrives, and Germany are back level.
[6442.56 - 6444.56] P:1861.19 E:0.119463 |  With about 90 seconds of novel time remaining.
[6444.56 - 6446.56] P:1821.78 E:0.115874 |  One-one.
[6446.56 - 6448.56] P:1907.79 E:0.107358 |  Oh, I said to him,
[6448.56 - 6450.56] P:1775.66 E:0.120946 |  he could have passed them.
[6450.56 - 6452.56] P:1662.14 E:0.116207 |  Of course, he could have finished it.
[6452.56 - 6454.56] P:1748.77 E:0.114124 |  He had so much pressure.
[6454.56 - 6456.56] P:1763.83 E:0.114342 |  There have been so many goals in the post.
[6456.56 - 6458.56] P:1787.91 E:0.117816 |  He had so many strikers and so many quality players there.
[6458.56 - 6460.56] P:1786.88 E:0.117121 |  It is absolutely no surprise whatsoever
[6460.56 - 6462.56] P:1747.84 E:0.109631 |  that they've got this all back.
[6462.56 - 6464.56] P:1749.75 E:0.113838 |  And then, no matter how much pressure
[6464.56 - 6466.56] P:1736.47 E:0.111672 |  they've got this all back.
[6466.56 - 6468.56] P:1738.95 E:0.110135 |  And they now have everything in their favour.
[6468.56 - 6470.56] P:1849.60 E:0.107875 |  Because the Spanish look tired,
[6470.56 - 6472.56] P:1820.71 E:0.103924 |  they've made a lot of changes.
[6472.56 - 6474.56] P:1809.54 E:0.114832 |  Well, it looks like we're going to have
[6474.56 - 6476.56] P:1843.35 E:0.102276 |  30 more minutes
[6476.56 - 6478.56] P:1840.21 E:0.113596 |  of pure drama here.
[6478.56 - 6480.56] P:1793.04 E:0.111521 |  Thank goodness you're not going to train to catch.
[6482.56 - 6484.56] P:1732.55 E:0.112709 |  The bench absolutely
[6484.56 - 6486.56] P:1701.26 E:0.118196 |  exploded down below.
[6486.56 - 6488.56] P:1680.67 E:0.113746 |  They were running on the pitch, they're whipping up the crowd.
[6488.56 - 6490.56] P:1680.77 E:0.095666 |  I can see a beer being
[6490.56 - 6492.56] P:1692.77 E:0.114000 |  tossed by the German supporters.
[6492.56 - 6494.56] P:1869.52 E:0.089215 |  By the way, there should be a number of players
[6494.56 - 6496.56] P:1759.95 E:0.103168 |  booked here.
[6496.56 - 6498.56] P:1839.29 E:0.097401 |  A good number booked here.
[6498.56 - 6500.56] P:1780.35 E:0.107807 |  He's actually booked one, right?
[6500.56 - 6502.56] P:1897.96 E:0.089074 |  I would say there were seven German
[6502.56 - 6504.56] P:1725.16 E:0.094770 |  players that are not on the pitch just now.
[6504.56 - 6506.56] P:1870.90 E:0.098990 |  He shouldn't have been on the pitch.
[6506.56 - 6508.56] P:1781.94 E:0.092395 |  They ran onto the pitch.
[6508.56 - 6510.56] P:1695.39 E:0.092003 |  The whole bunch of them booked. He's matched about one.
[6510.56 - 6512.56] P:1747.60 E:0.098441 |  I don't know which one it was.
[6512.56 - 6514.56] P:1919.26 E:0.075185 |  He looks quite disappointed.
[6514.56 - 6516.56] P:1913.33 E:0.095809 |  We'll try and bring you confirmation of that.
[6518.56 - 6520.56] P:1901.18 E:0.113408 |  But they always seem to find a way.
[6522.56 - 6524.56] P:1989.94 E:0.107156 |  They're going to have a one-one
[6524.56 - 6526.56] P:1954.19 E:0.115543 |  verts with a goal in the
[6526.56 - 6528.56] P:1856.78 E:0.102716 |  89th minute and there will be
[6528.56 - 6530.56] P:1849.51 E:0.096890 |  four minutes of added on time
[6530.56 - 6532.56] P:1820.48 E:0.107437 |  which we're now going into
[6532.56 - 6534.56] P:1890.45 E:0.113336 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live
[6534.56 - 6536.56] P:1832.91 E:0.098157 |  and BBC Sounds.
[6536.56 - 6538.56] P:1795.58 E:0.115994 |  But Germany have got designs on winning it
[6538.56 - 6540.56] P:1758.86 E:0.096324 |  here in stoppage time.
[6540.56 - 6542.56] P:1780.07 E:0.090541 |  Fabian gets the ball away
[6542.56 - 6544.56] P:1807.65 E:0.105345 |  up towards Rodgery.
[6544.56 - 6546.56] P:1763.67 E:0.103019 |  Rodgery turns and the pressure has to pass it
[6546.56 - 6548.56] P:1851.98 E:0.084590 |  back to Oono Cimod.
[6548.56 - 6550.56] P:1649.43 E:0.104486 |  And then it's a hard one to call.
[6550.56 - 6552.56] P:1894.18 E:0.111786 |  It's one-one. It's been a
[6552.56 - 6554.56] P:1841.20 E:0.087444 |  time of my experience with a
[6554.56 - 6556.56] P:1713.69 E:0.093694 |  better save until they scored the
[6556.56 - 6558.56] P:1902.10 E:0.106402 |  goal.
[6558.56 - 6560.56] P:1729.60 E:0.084721 |  And so Germany by some distance
[6560.56 - 6562.56] P:1920.77 E:0.117502 |  have been a better save.
[6562.56 - 6564.56] P:1949.44 E:0.103063 |  But they're not going to get it.
[6564.56 - 6566.56] P:1866.97 E:0.112946 |  They're going to get it.
[6566.56 - 6568.56] P:1944.66 E:0.110182 |  They're going to get it.
[6568.56 - 6570.56] P:1872.04 E:0.109774 |  They're going to get it.
[6570.56 - 6572.56] P:1921.56 E:0.105222 |  They're going to get it.
[6572.56 - 6574.56] P:1699.67 E:0.105504 |  They're going to get it.
[6574.56 - 6576.56] P:1802.58 E:0.103718 |  They're going to get it.
[6576.56 - 6578.56] P:1749.99 E:0.088560 |  They're going to get it.
[6578.56 - 6580.56] P:1780.81 E:0.095427 |  They're going to get it.
[6580.56 - 6582.56] P:1769.45 E:0.082888 |  They're going to have it.
[6582.56 - 6584.56] P:1743.35 E:0.091197 |  They're going to have it.
[6584.56 - 6586.56] P:1782.04 E:0.095095 |  They're going to get it.
[6586.56 - 6588.56] P:1744.29 E:0.104607 |  They've no time to get it.
[6588.56 - 6590.56] P:1787.98 E:0.107554 |  And it's a hard one to call.
[6590.56 - 6592.56] P:1822.85 E:0.107353 |  But you've got to see
[6592.56 - 6594.56] P:1915.89 E:0.101302 |  Germany are there in ascendance.
[6594.56 - 6596.56] P:1898.47 E:0.094192 |  Just know by a long way.
[6596.56 - 6598.56] P:1861.78 E:0.092659 |  And if you're the Spanish,
[6598.56 - 6600.56] P:1809.41 E:0.098012 |  you've got to try and make some changes now.
[6600.56 - 6602.56] P:1904.23 E:0.085600 |  They've made one or two already.
[6602.56 - 6604.56] P:2081.54 E:0.111758 |  The fact that they've made 1, 2,
[6604.56 - 6609.04] P:2018.86 E:0.102608 |  the sixth German yellow card in this quarterfinal here in Stuttgart.
[6609.04 - 6611.04] P:2040.72 E:0.103718 |  Still to come.
[6611.04 - 6613.28] P:2061.14 E:0.111405 |  We've got that game between Portugal and France.
[6613.28 - 6615.96] P:2012.93 E:0.092929 |  A spader on the attack, cross from the left-hand side,
[6615.96 - 6617.48] P:1859.41 E:0.094402 |  cleared away by Andric.
[6617.48 - 6619.80] P:1899.55 E:0.087230 |  There's a German player down at the moment.
[6619.80 - 6621.96] P:1901.51 E:0.110285 |  A Spain win the ball through Rodgery.
[6621.96 - 6624.64] P:1980.94 E:0.104917 |  It's got a head injury. They're entitled to play on.
[6624.64 - 6627.12] P:2053.27 E:0.103891 |  Oya Savl tries to wriggle away from a challenge,
[6627.12 - 6629.60] P:1958.42 E:0.104647 |  gets a push, goes down just outside the area.
[6629.60 - 6631.80] P:1855.71 E:0.102744 |  Referee Anthony Taylor says no foul.
[6631.80 - 6634.04] P:1888.68 E:0.105938 |  And now Germany try and break.
[6634.68 - 6636.52] P:1829.92 E:0.113157 |  They're quite happy to break now that the player,
[6636.52 - 6639.24] P:1877.56 E:0.087571 |  Fulcrum, is back on his feet.
[6639.24 - 6641.48] P:1958.65 E:0.106797 |  As Kroos took a tumble as well, it's all happening.
[6641.48 - 6643.72] P:1681.68 E:0.105909 |  I saw that classic win with footballers getting all the calls,
[6643.72 - 6646.04] P:1824.25 E:0.089465 |  they won't kick the ball out. They don't need to.
[6646.04 - 6647.72] P:1840.33 E:0.098180 |  It's not in the rules to kick the ball out.
[6647.72 - 6649.12] P:1800.24 E:0.081040 |  It's a referee's decision.
[6649.12 - 6650.76] P:1865.35 E:0.106155 |  Fulcrum will play absolutely fine.
[6650.76 - 6652.64] P:1800.21 E:0.088786 |  The Spanish were right to play on.
[6652.64 - 6654.68] P:1850.51 E:0.095705 |  But I think the Spanish should have got a free kick now.
[6654.68 - 6656.44] P:1866.67 E:0.092420 |  Just about 20 yards out.
[6656.44 - 6658.56] P:1755.90 E:0.109993 |  They were very, very lucky the Germans had.
[6658.56 - 6660.08] P:1930.73 E:0.097104 |  They were furious.
[6660.08 - 6661.20] P:1780.15 E:0.117794 |  They've got a little bit kind of a way
[6661.20 - 6663.44] P:1807.78 E:0.101266 |  they could have given a free kick away 20 yards out.
[6663.48 - 6666.16] P:1875.14 E:0.095987 |  Central, right in front of their own goal.
[6666.16 - 6668.08] P:1861.95 E:0.106427 |  They had the pyrotechnics at the start.
[6668.08 - 6671.96] P:1831.93 E:0.093957 |  The game itself was certainly a slow burner in the first half.
[6671.96 - 6674.68] P:1789.48 E:0.099290 |  But now it should boil up rather nicely
[6674.68 - 6677.16] P:1874.93 E:0.105110 |  for this extra time period that is looming.
[6677.16 - 6679.40] P:1867.82 E:0.104077 |  As Wirtz, they've got the equaliser for Germany,
[6679.40 - 6680.76] P:1986.66 E:0.103891 |  goes in pursuit of the ball.
[6680.76 - 6683.28] P:2014.28 E:0.091640 |  Uniseem on there will get there first.
[6683.28 - 6686.24] P:1995.84 E:0.106496 |  By my watch, we've just got about 70 seconds remaining
[6686.24 - 6689.40] P:1968.51 E:0.080787 |  of this minimum of four to be added on.
[6689.40 - 6693.12] P:1918.25 E:0.080397 |  And it's 1-1 between Spain and Germany.
[6693.16 - 6695.96] P:1868.19 E:0.088847 |  The two best sides so far in this tournament.
[6695.96 - 6697.40] P:1925.11 E:0.060471 |  Going at it.
[6697.40 - 6700.76] P:1888.56 E:0.081172 |  Head-to-head here in Stuttgart on five-lie.
[6700.76 - 6703.36] P:1921.83 E:0.090415 |  Don't forget tomorrow, England, Switzerland.
[6703.36 - 6705.68] P:2016.35 E:0.086061 |  Five o'clock commentary from Düsseldorf.
[6705.68 - 6708.12] P:1894.53 E:0.104557 |  As Ferran Torres bursts into the penalty area,
[6708.12 - 6711.00] P:1977.74 E:0.093570 |  Andric falls free kick to Germany.
[6711.00 - 6712.84] P:1905.72 E:0.108602 |  And Netherlands, Turkey will round off
[6712.84 - 6715.24] P:1920.89 E:0.096992 |  the last day's action tomorrow night in Berlin.
[6715.24 - 6716.36] P:1824.15 E:0.110080 |  You know what's really clever though,
[6716.36 - 6718.52] P:1891.57 E:0.072464 |  watching Wirtz and Eglensman is done.
[6718.52 - 6719.68] P:1831.23 E:0.115626 |  You know, as soon as they scored the goal,
[6719.68 - 6723.32] P:1834.56 E:0.095155 |  they had the wildest, you know, almost 2-3-5.
[6723.32 - 6725.68] P:1816.84 E:0.093950 |  They switched wild, but they were going for it.
[6725.68 - 6727.04] P:1983.57 E:0.096796 |  Soon as they scored the goal,
[6727.04 - 6729.48] P:1862.49 E:0.097355 |  they've managed to get back into a 4-2-3-1.
[6729.48 - 6730.60] P:1988.63 E:0.103780 |  And the two players,
[6730.60 - 6733.00] P:1865.74 E:0.102763 |  Moussiala, who doesn't play there in the centre midfield,
[6733.00 - 6736.32] P:1924.16 E:0.103093 |  he's gone back there because they have to get another player
[6736.32 - 6739.00] P:1885.89 E:0.096697 |  back into Andric's, who's had to go centre half
[6739.00 - 6740.04] P:1824.33 E:0.120189 |  alongside Rudiger.
[6740.04 - 6743.52] P:1913.83 E:0.091386 |  So the speed in which they're making these tactical changes
[6743.52 - 6746.28] P:1826.48 E:0.087751 |  and the cleverness of them, very impressive.
[6746.28 - 6747.64] P:1822.16 E:0.094029 |  30 seconds remain.
[6747.64 - 6749.20] P:1801.73 E:0.098513 |  Muller, left-hand side.
[6749.20 - 6750.76] P:1958.74 E:0.111058 |  Muller with the cross.
[6750.76 - 6754.72] P:1871.15 E:0.101760 |  And the header from Nato almost presented it towards Falkruck.
[6754.72 - 6757.44] P:1902.34 E:0.098816 |  He's going to keep the ball in play on that far side, the right.
[6757.44 - 6759.60] P:1932.27 E:0.099946 |  He tried to bring it down and around waist-height
[6759.60 - 6761.64] P:1908.99 E:0.092100 |  with his right boot, Kimmich with the cross.
[6761.64 - 6765.68] P:1775.09 E:0.103161 |  Muller is there and Muller just steers it wide of an air post.
[6765.68 - 6768.72] P:1950.30 E:0.111732 |  Never scored in his entire career in the Euros.
[6768.72 - 6770.60] P:1919.07 E:0.075911 |  He went close there.
[6770.60 - 6773.24] P:1849.60 E:0.100765 |  Honestly, the way it's going just now,
[6773.24 - 6776.20] P:1958.69 E:0.091652 |  it's been just half to get to extra time.
[6776.20 - 6778.12] P:1786.70 E:0.116128 |  They're hardly ever getting off the back at all,
[6778.16 - 6780.44] P:1892.49 E:0.103306 |  just know they've managed to get there,
[6780.44 - 6782.68] P:1858.97 E:0.100042 |  but by the skin of their teeth.
[6782.68 - 6785.04] P:1873.52 E:0.106909 |  There is the end of the 90 minutes.
[6785.04 - 6787.56] P:1779.98 E:0.092746 |  Spain won, Germany won,
[6787.56 - 6791.68] P:1685.98 E:0.098338 |  almost giving Spain the lead after 51 minutes.
[6791.68 - 6796.28] P:1704.99 E:0.099748 |  But then Florian Vert with an equaliser in the 89th minute.
[6796.28 - 6798.88] P:1598.98 E:0.087145 |  We're going into extra time.
[6798.88 - 6802.24] P:1631.68 E:0.093130 |  For the time being, we'll hand you to Hamburg and Kelly Gates.
[6802.24 - 6804.76] P:1569.48 E:0.106036 |  Thank you very much for that, Ian Dennis and Pat Levin,
[6804.76 - 6807.08] P:1600.05 E:0.103598 |  watching that game and Stuttgart for us.
[6807.08 - 6809.80] P:1542.76 E:0.103570 |  We are in Hamburg, we've got a big kick-off later on
[6809.80 - 6813.68] P:1555.02 E:0.089746 |  between Portugal and France, that one coming up at eight o'clock.
[6813.68 - 6817.68] P:1657.98 E:0.095998 |  But Pat, this game, it felt like Spain were in control,
[6817.68 - 6821.20] P:1719.36 E:0.084717 |  they got the goal, then there was a point where
[6821.20 - 6823.52] P:1761.33 E:0.100505 |  it felt like they were just trying to protect their lead.
[6823.52 - 6826.52] P:1710.07 E:0.082953 |  Was that the point that it started to slip away for them?
[6826.52 - 6831.44] P:1634.56 E:0.108805 |  Maybe so, but here it looks like the win and the goal,
[6831.44 - 6834.36] P:1571.09 E:0.107253 |  they are the best team, they are controlling last pass,
[6834.36 - 6837.40] P:1827.34 E:0.108314 |  but not the entire table game, but last pass of the game.
[6837.40 - 6839.48] P:1813.23 E:0.094736 |  They score the goal and it's just nice.
[6839.48 - 6842.60] P:1767.83 E:0.089052 |  We've seen a million times, you fall back a little bit,
[6842.60 - 6845.04] P:1656.52 E:0.095390 |  but I have to say the Germans changed everything.
[6845.04 - 6847.68] P:1783.98 E:0.097345 |  They started making tactical changes, substitutions,
[6847.68 - 6849.28] P:1686.34 E:0.100228 |  taking more chances, more risk,
[6849.28 - 6852.64] P:1753.55 E:0.093811 |  made more positive, more direct, getting balls into the box.
[6852.64 - 6855.16] P:1754.85 E:0.093754 |  Suddenly you've got Havertz is up there,
[6855.16 - 6858.48] P:1780.16 E:0.092896 |  Foucault is up there, Mussial is still on, Vertz comes on.
[6858.48 - 6861.24] P:1754.74 E:0.102249 |  They're attacking from absolutely everywhere.
[6861.24 - 6864.36] P:1750.58 E:0.085591 |  Eventually, just go to this 2-3 at the back,
[6864.36 - 6867.88] P:1731.30 E:0.086798 |  and you think you will throw the catch and sink into it,
[6867.88 - 6870.16] P:1774.82 E:0.091533 |  which they indeed did, but there's something else
[6870.16 - 6871.68] P:1717.86 E:0.070195 |  on top of it, Kelly.
[6871.68 - 6874.16] P:1841.65 E:0.102419 |  They just believe, they really just believe,
[6874.16 - 6876.24] P:1669.94 E:0.088275 |  they never feel as if they're out of it,
[6876.24 - 6879.00] P:1661.21 E:0.083457 |  and you can see that the Spanish team,
[6879.00 - 6881.60] P:1738.49 E:0.096620 |  they believe staff is sapping away
[6881.60 - 6883.80] P:1657.31 E:0.090509 |  as soon as they start to get overpowered.
[6883.80 - 6886.28] P:1648.09 E:0.095860 |  Now, it's very, very soon after they score the goal,
[6886.28 - 6889.00] P:1558.24 E:0.092585 |  and I've got to say it's partly down to Neglesman,
[6889.04 - 6892.44] P:1680.79 E:0.089769 |  who's made such very, very good and very, very brave changes.
[6892.44 - 6895.32] P:1522.75 E:0.105444 |  Yeah, Germany have been brave, and it has paid off for them.
[6895.32 - 6896.76] P:1454.52 E:0.097791 |  They are level with Spain.
[6896.76 - 6898.60] P:1981.20 E:0.074179 |  They're heading into extra time.
[6898.60 - 6901.24] P:1751.16 E:0.096173 |  Pat Neven talked about the noise inside the stadium
[6901.24 - 6902.36] P:1979.28 E:0.075778 |  and Stuttgart there.
[6902.36 - 6905.40] P:1847.71 E:0.093037 |  Actually, here in Hamburg, where it looks as though
[6905.40 - 6907.44] P:1799.13 E:0.087173 |  it's mostly France and Portugal supporters,
[6907.44 - 6910.24] P:1975.25 E:0.091565 |  there was huge noises as Germany equalised.
[6910.24 - 6912.04] P:1730.57 E:0.089788 |  Alistair Bruce Ball's going to be commentating
[6912.04 - 6915.48] P:1849.24 E:0.087224 |  on Portugal France later, but Ali, just a word on the reaction
[6915.48 - 6916.72] P:1821.31 E:0.091617 |  to that Germany equaliser.
[6916.76 - 6919.16] P:2055.78 E:0.097377 |  Clearly, there are German fans inside this stadium as well,
[6919.16 - 6922.60] P:1963.21 E:0.079438 |  and I was trying to think, as to the Portugal and France fans,
[6922.60 - 6925.60] P:1865.06 E:0.084911 |  maybe they've got a leaning towards who they might...
[6925.60 - 6927.32] P:1984.04 E:0.101096 |  you know, fancy-facing in the semi-finals.
[6927.32 - 6929.84] P:2041.70 E:0.087142 |  I think, plus just the drama of a late goal,
[6929.84 - 6932.20] P:2072.71 E:0.089938 |  game has been shown entirely on the big screens
[6932.20 - 6933.36] P:2131.81 E:0.088044 |  at either end of this stadium,
[6933.36 - 6935.92] P:1980.30 E:0.070268 |  and the fans have been in here for ages, haven't they?
[6935.92 - 6937.68] P:2097.58 E:0.100388 |  They've been here to watch that entire game.
[6937.68 - 6940.04] P:2000.92 E:0.070346 |  So, yeah, atmosphere is good.
[6940.04 - 6941.88] P:1744.83 E:0.098365 |  Team News ahead of the eight o'clock kick-off.
[6941.88 - 6943.72] P:2271.10 E:0.090096 |  It is really nice and simple, actually.
[6943.72 - 6945.92] P:2185.68 E:0.089428 |  Roberto Martinez has gone with exactly the same
[6945.96 - 6949.36] P:2096.53 E:0.089359 |  Portugal starting 11 that Squeak threw in the penalty shootout
[6949.36 - 6951.20] P:2088.98 E:0.092218 |  against Slovenia in the last 16.
[6951.20 - 6954.48] P:2051.12 E:0.080596 |  So, Cristiano Ronaldo goes looking for that first goal
[6954.48 - 6957.20] P:2045.35 E:0.086645 |  at this tournament, captains the side and leads the line.
[6957.20 - 6960.44] P:2119.49 E:0.086943 |  Two changes for France, two players getting their first starts
[6960.44 - 6961.72] P:1985.32 E:0.060997 |  at this tournament.
[6961.72 - 6964.16] P:1914.73 E:0.099366 |  21-year-old Eduardo Camarvinga of Real Madrid
[6964.16 - 6965.44] P:2004.43 E:0.063692 |  comes into the midfield.
[6965.44 - 6967.92] P:2030.93 E:0.084996 |  That's because Adrián Rabio is suspended,
[6967.92 - 6970.88] P:2088.49 E:0.093963 |  and Randall Colomuane, who's made a few substitute appearances
[6970.88 - 6973.08] P:2058.90 E:0.085027 |  at this tournament, took great effect in the last game
[6973.08 - 6974.08] P:2050.60 E:0.081045 |  against Belgium.
[6974.08 - 6976.52] P:1998.04 E:0.076595 |  And the first shot that was deflected in for the winner,
[6976.52 - 6978.72] P:1881.20 E:0.069784 |  he comes in for Marcus Turan.
[6978.72 - 6981.56] P:1870.59 E:0.087480 |  Let's check in at Wimbledon with Ian Carter.
[6981.56 - 6984.36] P:1790.79 E:0.096803 |  Well, the first set went the way of Emma Radacanu
[6984.36 - 6988.20] P:1512.00 E:0.090948 |  against Maria Sacari, the ninth seed from Greece.
[6988.20 - 6990.40] P:1760.42 E:0.096288 |  And it's Radacanu of Great Britain,
[6990.40 - 6992.92] P:1927.03 E:0.101835 |  who's got the early break of serve in the second
[6992.92 - 6994.76] P:1919.34 E:0.083514 |  to open a 2-1 lead.
[6994.76 - 6996.44] P:1672.45 E:0.101333 |  She's having to work really hard
[6996.44 - 6998.84] P:1896.12 E:0.080730 |  to consolidate that break of serve,
[6998.84 - 7001.44] P:1867.72 E:0.093082 |  but she does have game point right now, Kelly.
[7001.44 - 7004.56] P:1822.45 E:0.092461 |  This is the best tennis this week that we've seen
[7004.56 - 7009.84] P:1809.13 E:0.091790 |  from Emma Radacanu since she won the US Open in 2021.
[7009.84 - 7012.40] P:1682.94 E:0.101011 |  And it's worth remembering that she beat Sacari
[7012.40 - 7014.88] P:1610.75 E:0.103600 |  in the semifinals at Flushing Meadows,
[7014.88 - 7017.96] P:1638.20 E:0.101685 |  en route to that maiden Grand Slam title.
[7017.96 - 7019.96] P:1817.71 E:0.100662 |  Radacanu serves it out there.
[7019.96 - 7022.44] P:1805.39 E:0.086151 |  She does consolidate the break of serve.
[7022.44 - 7025.32] P:1543.63 E:0.080172 |  She now leads by three games to one in the second set,
[7025.32 - 7027.56] P:1770.61 E:0.056972 |  and by one set to luck.
[7027.56 - 7028.92] P:1884.51 E:0.114210 |  Thank you very much for that, Ian.
[7028.92 - 7030.76] P:1357.57 E:0.099642 |  Remember, we will have regular updates here
[7030.76 - 7032.48] P:1748.26 E:0.083524 |  on the next five live sports,
[7032.48 - 7034.48] P:1901.58 E:0.088524 |  but you can listen to full coverage of Wimbledon
[7034.48 - 7036.76] P:1808.23 E:0.074360 |  on five sports extra.
[7036.76 - 7040.28] P:1707.59 E:0.097072 |  Extra time about to get underway in Stuttgart.
[7040.28 - 7042.84] P:1870.30 E:0.094727 |  It finished Spain one, Germany one,
[7042.84 - 7046.08] P:1736.50 E:0.095795 |  after 90 minutes taking you through the period of extra time.
[7046.08 - 7047.68] P:1851.95 E:0.085395 |  It's Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis.
[7047.68 - 7048.68] P:1870.74 E:0.102879 |  Thank you, Kelly.
[7048.68 - 7051.20] P:2021.28 E:0.091903 |  Germany have made their sixth and final change,
[7051.20 - 7054.48] P:1865.94 E:0.091025 |  and it's the Stuttgart captain here in his home ground,
[7054.48 - 7056.68] P:1897.18 E:0.102378 |  Valdemir Anton, who's going to be coming on
[7056.68 - 7059.48] P:1705.81 E:0.104165 |  for just his second appearance of these Euros.
[7059.48 - 7061.48] P:1858.99 E:0.095832 |  He's going to be playing against Denmark,
[7061.48 - 7063.48] P:1763.65 E:0.103973 |  so he will slot in alongside Rudiger,
[7063.48 - 7066.48] P:1699.14 E:0.095234 |  and the player who's gone off is Kei Haber.
[7066.48 - 7069.48] P:1749.18 E:0.105698 |  Yeah, and they've just gone safe again, haven't they?
[7069.48 - 7071.48] P:1882.88 E:0.093622 |  Knowing that they can adapt any time.
[7071.48 - 7074.48] P:1799.14 E:0.103526 |  They've actually looked to me like they've gone off almost a 3-4-3.
[7074.48 - 7077.48] P:1664.82 E:0.088832 |  Rudiger's going to be a right centre back at this point in time.
[7077.48 - 7080.48] P:1622.93 E:0.097307 |  And that's what you get at the very top level.
[7080.48 - 7083.48] P:1801.75 E:0.089558 |  Adaptability, ask different questions, change the shape,
[7083.48 - 7086.48] P:1694.23 E:0.095343 |  and believing that players can do different things.
[7086.48 - 7088.48] P:1694.40 E:0.091297 |  When you ask them, we do different things,
[7088.48 - 7090.48] P:1809.36 E:0.081661 |  and confuse your position.
[7090.48 - 7092.48] P:1713.88 E:0.094689 |  I have to say, Niggles, he's done it more.
[7092.48 - 7094.48] P:1931.33 E:0.094201 |  Well, it's the first period of extra time.
[7094.48 - 7096.48] P:1895.87 E:0.089189 |  He's under way.
[7096.48 - 7099.48] P:1805.97 E:0.080290 |  Germany in all whites playing from left to right here.
[7099.48 - 7101.48] P:1816.83 E:0.090486 |  Hab Kimmich is a right back.
[7101.48 - 7104.48] P:1772.37 E:0.092445 |  Rudiger now has Anton alongside him.
[7104.48 - 7107.48] P:1792.05 E:0.087324 |  Middelstadt, another substitute, there's a left back.
[7107.48 - 7110.48] P:1817.47 E:0.087874 |  You've got Wirtz, Andric, Kroos, Mussiala, Mulla and Fulkrich.
[7110.48 - 7112.48] P:1864.02 E:0.071501 |  Spain are attacking.
[7112.48 - 7114.48] P:1864.98 E:0.094542 |  Ferrantoro is trying to get his head onto that.
[7114.48 - 7116.48] P:1934.43 E:0.090030 |  And it's a goalie,
[7116.48 - 7118.48] P:1942.88 E:0.096811 |  and he's targeting out for a goal kick.
[7118.48 - 7120.48] P:1835.14 E:0.082783 |  Spain have Simon in goal,
[7120.48 - 7122.48] P:1716.76 E:0.093657 |  Carvajal, Nacho, Laforte and Guacare, Fabian Rodri,
[7122.48 - 7124.48] P:1750.90 E:0.075586 |  Olmo Moreno, Torres and Oya Sabel.
[7124.48 - 7126.48] P:1945.21 E:0.089938 |  So they, by my calculation, still have
[7126.48 - 7128.48] P:1859.92 E:0.070030 |  two substitutes who they can bring on
[7128.48 - 7130.48] P:1802.76 E:0.083440 |  if they so wish
[7130.48 - 7132.48] P:1931.50 E:0.085334 |  for Luis de La Fuente.
[7132.48 - 7134.48] P:1852.66 E:0.082386 |  They're a 63-year-old coach.
[7134.48 - 7136.48] P:1838.12 E:0.102561 |  But we're in extra time.
[7136.48 - 7138.48] P:1802.79 E:0.091931 |  Five live and BBC sounds
[7138.48 - 7140.48] P:1805.27 E:0.067694 |  on a busy weekend
[7140.48 - 7142.48] P:1835.89 E:0.101856 |  that we're about to go into here.
[7142.48 - 7144.48] P:1665.46 E:0.063060 |  A sporting action.
[7144.48 - 7146.48] P:1800.14 E:0.061018 |  Not just the Euros,
[7146.48 - 7148.48] P:1955.77 E:0.107018 |  Wimbledon, British Grand Prix
[7148.48 - 7150.48] P:1757.45 E:0.094346 |  and that Rugby Union test tomorrow morning.
[7150.48 - 7152.48] P:1971.12 E:0.103562 |  But here is Fulkrich turning and running.
[7152.48 - 7154.48] P:1934.09 E:0.080428 |  Pass the centre-circle
[7154.48 - 7156.48] P:1727.64 E:0.094004 |  in the Spain heart.
[7156.48 - 7158.48] P:1915.72 E:0.093523 |  Kroos comes in from Wirtz
[7158.48 - 7160.48] P:1933.86 E:0.095736 |  and Nacho is the one
[7160.48 - 7162.48] P:1908.03 E:0.107737 |  who has to turn it behind for a corner kick.
[7162.48 - 7164.48] P:1876.74 E:0.100675 |  Look at that, there was a little bit of
[7164.48 - 7166.48] P:2022.44 E:0.105762 |  hesitation between him and Simon.
[7166.48 - 7168.48] P:1944.34 E:0.086021 |  There's no chances.
[7168.48 - 7170.48] P:1749.44 E:0.109551 |  Horrible possession at Wirtz, but that ball into Wirtz.
[7170.48 - 7172.48] P:1823.29 E:0.091674 |  He's gone to Wirtz and to Defenders.
[7172.48 - 7174.48] P:1865.69 E:0.095750 |  Doesn't want to take any chances.
[7174.48 - 7176.48] P:1777.24 E:0.077198 |  Goldkeeper just can't quite come to it.
[7176.48 - 7178.48] P:1818.47 E:0.100427 |  He's actually, well, obviously he's done well.
[7178.48 - 7180.48] P:1937.19 E:0.081625 |  He scores since he came on, but Wirtz is
[7180.48 - 7182.48] P:1863.70 E:0.116472 |  special player. He's had a really, really good season.
[7182.48 - 7184.48] P:1985.58 E:0.092194 |  He's been a lot of well-to-get
[7184.48 - 7186.48] P:1927.59 E:0.099521 |  involved in this game, but now
[7186.48 - 7188.48] P:1932.52 E:0.102287 |  he looks to be one of the most important players.
[7188.48 - 7190.48] P:2014.25 E:0.102946 |  That's not the most important.
[7190.48 - 7192.48] P:1991.12 E:0.085331 |  Joining the break for extra time,
[7192.48 - 7194.48] P:1981.00 E:0.107960 |  the third-choice goldkeeper, Alibaba Balmón
[7194.48 - 7196.48] P:1954.84 E:0.097743 |  was trying to stir up the Stuttgart crowd.
[7196.48 - 7198.48] P:1812.97 E:0.091217 |  Carvajal has gone to
[7198.48 - 7200.48] P:1881.93 E:0.097056 |  the floor in an off-the-ball
[7200.48 - 7202.48] P:1912.50 E:0.098990 |  incident and he's being helped back up by Mullah.
[7202.48 - 7204.48] P:1991.67 E:0.095754 |  Germany have a corner kick.
[7204.48 - 7206.48] P:1814.04 E:0.055260 |  1-1
[7206.48 - 7208.48] P:2001.49 E:0.088383 |  early in the first period of extra time
[7208.48 - 7210.48] P:1878.91 E:0.082760 |  here in Stuttgart. Corner kick
[7210.48 - 7212.48] P:1833.46 E:0.078989 |  then far side the left.
[7212.48 - 7214.48] P:1848.79 E:0.098941 |  In it comes now. There is another coming
[7214.48 - 7216.48] P:1934.08 E:0.057675 |  together between
[7216.48 - 7218.48] P:1932.50 E:0.079705 |  Mullah. On this occasion it was
[7218.48 - 7220.48] P:2026.46 E:0.098464 |  Nacho.
[7222.48 - 7224.48] P:1881.27 E:0.086215 |  There's a little slip. This is Kroos.
[7224.48 - 7226.48] P:1858.92 E:0.068965 |  Mussiala.
[7226.48 - 7228.48] P:1825.22 E:0.090750 |  Mussiala passes the ball out
[7228.48 - 7230.48] P:1789.16 E:0.070433 |  towards the left-hand side.
[7230.48 - 7232.48] P:1755.85 E:0.049903 |  And then
[7232.48 - 7234.48] P:1935.32 E:0.090228 |  Wirtz able to turn. Left
[7234.48 - 7236.48] P:1742.75 E:0.081591 |  corner of the area. Helped out by Mussiala.
[7238.48 - 7240.48] P:1901.41 E:0.107090 |  Middleschtatt delivers the cross. Hasn't been
[7240.48 - 7242.48] P:1846.88 E:0.084922 |  dealt with. It went through
[7242.48 - 7244.48] P:1764.00 E:0.056385 |  two Spanish defenders.
[7244.48 - 7246.48] P:1893.29 E:0.096312 |  Flags up on this near side. It'll be a Spain
[7246.48 - 7248.48] P:1725.57 E:0.099693 |  free kick. Yeah, but the Germans are actually
[7248.48 - 7250.48] P:1698.23 E:0.103007 |  smothering him. It just cannot go out.
[7250.48 - 7252.48] P:1753.91 E:0.085182 |  The Spanish, now when they had Marat
[7252.48 - 7254.48] P:1782.32 E:0.073357 |  up to open the ball was coming up to him.
[7254.48 - 7256.48] P:1638.12 E:0.100626 |  He was holding it well. Nice little
[7256.48 - 7258.48] P:1738.50 E:0.095007 |  neat 1-2 passes. Alone he's way
[7258.48 - 7260.48] P:1831.39 E:0.083795 |  plus. Come on. But if you look at that
[7260.48 - 7262.48] P:1837.92 E:0.075975 |  forward lane now, it's completely
[7262.48 - 7264.48] P:1997.84 E:0.073364 |  changed for the Spanishers.
[7264.48 - 7266.48] P:1773.81 E:0.107818 |  Yassabao, Moreno and Torres are up
[7266.48 - 7268.48] P:1877.53 E:0.087277 |  front now. And that hasn't looked
[7268.48 - 7270.48] P:1863.33 E:0.092159 |  as dangerous as the previous three.
[7270.48 - 7272.48] P:1914.61 E:0.093055 |  That says that Germany is smothering
[7272.48 - 7274.48] P:1963.83 E:0.086446 |  Spain. Certainly
[7274.48 - 7276.48] P:1952.85 E:0.100718 |  suffocating conditions here
[7276.48 - 7278.48] P:1751.10 E:0.092892 |  on a very humid evening.
[7278.48 - 7280.48] P:1867.84 E:0.112462 |  Kukarera has gone down off the ball
[7280.48 - 7282.48] P:1899.40 E:0.096568 |  with Wirtz. He's gone down with
[7282.48 - 7284.48] P:1960.25 E:0.096225 |  Wirtz. He's headed into the floor. Anthony
[7284.48 - 7286.48] P:2003.33 E:0.091527 |  Taylor has spotted it.
[7286.48 - 7288.48] P:2104.31 E:0.106272 |  The Spanish bench are all up in arms.
[7288.48 - 7290.48] P:1992.71 E:0.093115 |  And Wirtz is shown
[7290.48 - 7292.48] P:1983.64 E:0.087109 |  a yellow card.
[7292.48 - 7294.48] P:1911.12 E:0.086164 |  Yes, another yellow card
[7294.48 - 7296.48] P:1983.20 E:0.087969 |  shown to a German player.
[7296.48 - 7298.48] P:1790.35 E:0.102208 |  You wouldn't believe how many times
[7298.48 - 7300.48] P:1751.29 E:0.095192 |  Kukarera and this German has gone down holding
[7300.48 - 7302.48] P:1796.92 E:0.073284 |  his face. It's extraordinary
[7302.48 - 7304.48] P:1827.43 E:0.064240 |  the amount of times he's done it.
[7304.48 - 7306.48] P:1636.61 E:0.104851 |  And he's kind of run towards a player. He's kind
[7306.48 - 7308.48] P:1799.52 E:0.068390 |  of blocked him a lot of it, but it's the way
[7308.48 - 7310.48] P:1752.59 E:0.068268 |  he throws himself down. It's
[7310.48 - 7312.48] P:1839.74 E:0.082526 |  incredible. That's the tenth yellow card
[7312.48 - 7314.48] P:1744.98 E:0.081178 |  in the game. Seven to the host
[7314.48 - 7316.48] P:1812.83 E:0.082593 |  nation on five live
[7316.48 - 7318.48] P:1834.03 E:0.066759 |  here in extra time.
[7318.48 - 7320.48] P:1914.27 E:0.079943 |  The ball back by La Porte
[7320.48 - 7322.48] P:1913.55 E:0.076601 |  to Unozimot
[7322.48 - 7324.48] P:1901.01 E:0.096608 |  who's well out of his penalty area
[7324.48 - 7326.48] P:1798.93 E:0.091514 |  almost to the edge of the centre circle
[7326.48 - 7328.48] P:1752.01 E:0.091514 |  chips it forward headed on by Fabian
[7328.48 - 7330.48] P:1593.91 E:0.079323 |  Moreno out towards
[7330.48 - 7332.48] P:1665.50 E:0.098870 |  Olmo. Kukarera ahead of him.
[7332.48 - 7334.48] P:1868.05 E:0.095061 |  Olmo tries to pass the ball forward to
[7334.48 - 7336.48] P:1819.22 E:0.081109 |  Oya Savo. And it
[7336.48 - 7338.48] P:1858.71 E:0.094833 |  runs in a diagonal path
[7338.48 - 7340.48] P:1920.06 E:0.092123 |  out for a goal kick. One
[7340.48 - 7342.48] P:1871.14 E:0.080393 |  one. This has got the look of penalties.
[7342.48 - 7344.48] P:1386.30 E:0.129953 |  No, I'm not diving in there yet.
[7344.48 - 7346.48] P:1624.63 E:0.099868 |  I'm definitely not diving in there yet.
[7346.48 - 7348.48] P:1678.11 E:0.088669 |  That was really neat, you know
[7348.48 - 7350.48] P:1721.57 E:0.101144 |  from the Spanish club. Not being up the park
[7350.48 - 7352.48] P:1919.51 E:0.092844 |  that much in the last quarter
[7352.48 - 7354.48] P:1840.55 E:0.089082 |  of the game in normal time.
[7354.48 - 7356.48] P:1849.66 E:0.100431 |  But that was clever. I mean, he passed it well
[7356.48 - 7358.48] P:1824.07 E:0.082483 |  and they're there again.
[7358.48 - 7360.48] P:1888.88 E:0.084074 |  Oya Savo gets the shot away
[7360.48 - 7362.48] P:1895.66 E:0.089948 |  blocks. Anton digs it out
[7362.48 - 7364.48] P:1919.36 E:0.074283 |  with his shaven head. Here is
[7364.48 - 7366.48] P:1942.02 E:0.084947 |  Rodgery just touches the ball back
[7366.48 - 7368.48] P:1916.35 E:0.088376 |  the port forward ball early to
[7368.48 - 7370.48] P:1844.78 E:0.073564 |  Kukarera.
[7370.48 - 7372.48] P:1875.96 E:0.100288 |  Kukarera to Olmo on this near side the left
[7372.48 - 7374.48] P:1936.80 E:0.091324 |  Redshirts, Navy Shorts playing from right to left
[7374.48 - 7376.48] P:1928.95 E:0.080274 |  as we look. Strokes it back to
[7376.48 - 7378.48] P:1820.87 E:0.088015 |  Kukarera. Dele Fuente
[7378.48 - 7380.48] P:1945.60 E:0.095752 |  only lost one of 14
[7380.48 - 7382.48] P:1839.30 E:0.099738 |  competitive games. Narglesman
[7382.48 - 7384.48] P:1895.97 E:0.107082 |  who's yet to lose a competitive fixture
[7384.48 - 7386.48] P:1951.94 E:0.089357 |  since he took charge last
[7386.48 - 7388.48] P:1867.02 E:0.053145 |  September.
[7388.48 - 7390.48] P:1851.94 E:0.101679 |  Scenic side come from behind
[7390.48 - 7392.48] P:1858.77 E:0.089553 |  and score eight and that's the reason we're in this
[7392.48 - 7394.48] P:1905.40 E:0.075193 |  additional 30. As the ball
[7394.48 - 7396.48] P:1884.52 E:0.082167 |  is passed out by Fabian
[7396.48 - 7398.48] P:1716.65 E:0.041977 |  and then
[7398.48 - 7400.48] P:1688.34 E:0.072428 |  Nacho.
[7400.48 - 7402.48] P:1823.04 E:0.112326 |  Ferrant Torres on that right-hand side
[7402.48 - 7404.48] P:1835.31 E:0.110534 |  has to go all the way back.
[7404.48 - 7406.48] P:1993.74 E:0.088359 |  They've lost that little
[7406.48 - 7408.48] P:1993.80 E:0.105796 |  sprinkling of stardust with
[7408.48 - 7410.48] P:1942.64 E:0.104473 |  Williams off the field and
[7410.48 - 7412.48] P:1960.62 E:0.101968 |  LaMine Amal as well have Spain.
[7414.48 - 7416.48] P:1932.69 E:0.111338 |  All of a sudden it could be a case
[7416.48 - 7418.48] P:1866.97 E:0.088233 |  of Groundhog Day
[7418.48 - 7420.48] P:1956.09 E:0.108027 |  if you're a supporter of Spain
[7420.48 - 7422.48] P:1793.53 E:0.085869 |  their record against the Hodes
[7422.48 - 7424.48] P:1880.45 E:0.076266 |  Nations as Fabian
[7424.48 - 7426.48] P:1734.32 E:0.095978 |  curls the ball out to Ferrant Torres
[7426.48 - 7428.48] P:1883.19 E:0.092261 |  level with the penalty area right-hand side
[7428.48 - 7430.48] P:1662.53 E:0.079270 |  back with Carvajal. Left footed ball
[7430.48 - 7432.48] P:1932.05 E:0.089113 |  back towards Torres. Carvajal
[7432.48 - 7434.48] P:1745.41 E:0.096004 |  bombs on ahead of him and he finds him. He's got round the back here
[7434.48 - 7436.48] P:1811.52 E:0.080684 |  but he couldn't deliver the cross. Now he
[7436.48 - 7438.48] P:1826.34 E:0.104717 |  has. Chips it in. Rudiger heads it away
[7438.48 - 7440.48] P:1906.65 E:0.086018 |  Fabian. Nice little touch
[7440.48 - 7442.48] P:1970.52 E:0.089150 |  off the top of his left foot. Just drifts
[7442.48 - 7444.48] P:1952.31 E:0.095345 |  out towards that far side. Germany
[7444.48 - 7446.48] P:1890.15 E:0.093963 |  try and wrestle the ball off him. Plays
[7446.48 - 7448.48] P:1944.07 E:0.086644 |  a cute ball inside towards rotary. Spain
[7448.48 - 7450.48] P:1915.78 E:0.094501 |  keep the ball well under pressure. Nacho
[7450.48 - 7452.48] P:1728.77 E:0.096802 |  finds Moreno. Moreno along the ground.
[7452.48 - 7454.48] P:1818.44 E:0.106371 |  Olmo now left corner of the area. Carvajal
[7454.48 - 7456.48] P:1897.38 E:0.105580 |  on the open up. Olmo goes for goal.
[7456.48 - 7458.48] P:1998.18 E:0.091063 |  Blocks comes out towards rotary. Spain
[7458.48 - 7460.48] P:1947.37 E:0.096605 |  keep the ball well Pat Nevin. Yeah
[7460.48 - 7462.48] P:1843.19 E:0.108956 |  best period in the past since they actually
[7462.48 - 7464.48] P:1818.31 E:0.089125 |  scored their own goal. A lot of bad
[7464.48 - 7466.48] P:1827.48 E:0.096981 |  belief coming back. Just that rest after
[7466.48 - 7468.48] P:1814.18 E:0.097095 |  the 90 minutes giving them a bit of left
[7468.48 - 7470.48] P:1867.22 E:0.092228 |  and certainly the manager said look
[7470.48 - 7472.48] P:1655.32 E:0.104310 |  you've got to hold the ball. You've got to have
[7472.48 - 7474.48] P:1865.20 E:0.095453 |  foot hold in this game. They have manis to do
[7474.48 - 7476.48] P:1952.25 E:0.086655 |  that at the start of this extra time.
[7476.48 - 7478.48] P:1923.97 E:0.103470 |  They're slugging out here in
[7478.48 - 7480.48] P:1874.24 E:0.090737 |  the middle. Here is Olmo. Couldn't
[7480.48 - 7482.48] P:1874.57 E:0.105771 |  thread the ball through. Blocked by
[7482.48 - 7484.48] P:1901.59 E:0.101120 |  Rudiger. Olmo reacts to get that loose ball
[7484.48 - 7486.48] P:1863.54 E:0.085486 |  back. Here is Olmo once again.
[7486.48 - 7488.48] P:1909.78 E:0.090010 |  Back with Kukereya. Midway through
[7488.48 - 7490.48] P:1904.36 E:0.091334 |  the Germany half. Germany got every
[7490.48 - 7492.48] P:1914.29 E:0.100012 |  white shirt back behind the ball. Le
[7492.48 - 7494.48] P:1948.50 E:0.084440 |  Porte to Nacho inside the center
[7494.48 - 7496.48] P:1882.33 E:0.070329 |  circle. Rodry
[7496.48 - 7498.48] P:1927.83 E:0.069272 |  gives it to Nacho.
[7498.48 - 7500.48] P:1754.58 E:0.079454 |  And now with Le Porte to come forward.
[7500.48 - 7502.48] P:1948.66 E:0.077659 |  He'll carry the ball as far as he can.
[7502.48 - 7504.48] P:1836.90 E:0.090334 |  They'll burst there from Le Porte.
[7504.48 - 7506.48] P:1889.30 E:0.103507 |  Then they lose the ball. Muller
[7506.48 - 7508.48] P:1913.78 E:0.110532 |  didn't really have anybody
[7508.48 - 7510.48] P:1928.03 E:0.099056 |  going too far ahead. There was only
[7510.48 - 7512.48] P:1966.34 E:0.089576 |  Fulcruc. They decide to keep the ball
[7512.48 - 7514.48] P:1929.23 E:0.095932 |  and it's with Wirtz on the halfway
[7514.48 - 7516.48] P:1861.12 E:0.080885 |  line and he finds Muller now. Muller
[7516.48 - 7518.48] P:1950.53 E:0.096072 |  challenged by Kukereya. It goes out of
[7518.48 - 7520.48] P:1906.46 E:0.102861 |  play for a Germany throw. They take it quickly.
[7520.48 - 7522.48] P:1955.27 E:0.094668 |  Muller with a throw. Finds Wirtz.
[7522.48 - 7524.48] P:1910.67 E:0.100761 |  Wirtz with a cross from the right-hand side.
[7524.48 - 7526.48] P:1862.23 E:0.066048 |  Clear away by Nacho. Downward
[7526.48 - 7528.48] P:1796.12 E:0.086979 |  header back by Le Porte
[7528.48 - 7530.48] P:1736.64 E:0.062802 |  and then Oyasavl
[7530.48 - 7532.48] P:1677.78 E:0.066776 |  to Fabian. More
[7532.48 - 7534.48] P:1708.33 E:0.080966 |  players have gone down.
[7534.48 - 7536.48] P:1861.04 E:0.099497 |  That was Kroos.
[7536.48 - 7538.48] P:1918.51 E:0.055642 |  You're in a
[7538.48 - 7540.48] P:1885.20 E:0.101292 |  Kroos right at the
[7540.48 - 7542.48] P:1836.96 E:0.091582 |  start of the game.
[7542.48 - 7544.48] P:1787.31 E:0.081650 |  He leaves his body in to take a
[7544.48 - 7546.48] P:1859.20 E:0.074256 |  play-out and we thought he should have been booked.
[7546.48 - 7548.48] P:1445.23 E:0.086884 |  I wonder if that was not dissimilar
[7548.48 - 7550.48] P:1864.73 E:0.051031 |  if it was a foot stamp.
[7550.48 - 7552.48] P:1566.99 E:0.096098 |  No, not dissimilar, but not as vicious
[7552.48 - 7554.48] P:1816.59 E:0.084787 |  as the one he did. Very
[7554.48 - 7556.48] P:1804.57 E:0.077946 |  early on in the game against
[7556.48 - 7558.48] P:1874.55 E:0.052886 |  Pedry. I think Kroos looks a wee bit
[7558.48 - 7560.48] P:1700.72 E:0.095327 |  tired out there, don't you?
[7560.48 - 7562.48] P:1903.88 E:0.065046 |  Well, he's wiped.
[7562.48 - 7564.48] P:1934.74 E:0.089024 |  He's been
[7564.48 - 7566.48] P:1720.09 E:0.091345 |  lured out of international
[7566.48 - 7568.48] P:1771.83 E:0.081473 |  retirement in March
[7568.48 - 7570.48] P:1899.86 E:0.106550 |  after retiring when they lost
[7570.48 - 7572.48] P:1909.59 E:0.082547 |  to England in the last Euros three years
[7572.48 - 7574.48] P:1786.87 E:0.109025 |  ago. He will be bringing
[7574.48 - 7576.48] P:1811.46 E:0.098071 |  to an end. The glittering career
[7576.48 - 7578.48] P:1852.94 E:0.087722 |  is there to be
[7578.48 - 7580.48] P:1837.94 E:0.098158 |  one final dance. He's back on his feet
[7580.48 - 7582.48] P:1975.87 E:0.092012 |  now as the 34-year-old. They've used
[7582.48 - 7584.48] P:2049.02 E:0.092530 |  all their substitutes, so he's got
[7584.48 - 7586.48] P:1871.27 E:0.094473 |  to see it through to the bitter end.
[7586.48 - 7588.48] P:1987.76 E:0.092779 |  Or will it be a joyful conclusion
[7588.48 - 7590.48] P:1910.67 E:0.091454 |  here as we're still at
[7590.48 - 7592.48] P:1832.17 E:0.059699 |  the end of the year?
[7592.48 - 7594.48] P:1731.33 E:0.078705 |  We're going to have a
[7594.48 - 7596.48] P:1693.84 E:0.058400 |  very serious period of extra time.
[7596.48 - 7598.48] P:1856.36 E:0.076115 |  We have about six minutes to go
[7598.48 - 7600.48] P:1552.24 E:0.086356 |  in the break.
[7600.48 - 7602.48] P:1795.49 E:0.081036 |  I think the changes that
[7602.48 - 7604.48] P:1591.81 E:0.092526 |  Farnham Nagersman has made
[7604.48 - 7606.48] P:1615.57 E:0.085118 |  for this part of the game
[7606.48 - 7608.48] P:1634.67 E:0.105697 |  haven't worked as well. The
[7608.48 - 7610.48] P:1868.64 E:0.073047 |  negative ones have had a negative
[7610.48 - 7612.48] P:1707.01 E:0.101548 |  effect on his team so far. They
[7612.48 - 7614.48] P:1552.03 E:0.081057 |  finally get out of their own half.
[7614.48 - 7616.48] P:1518.22 E:0.098294 |  In Spanish, they've lifted a little bit.
[7616.48 - 7618.48] P:1716.08 E:0.077130 |  They believe in themselves a wee
[7618.48 - 7620.48] P:1757.98 E:0.081811 |  bit.
[7620.48 - 7622.48] P:1964.91 E:0.115808 |  They're going to have a
[7622.48 - 7624.48] P:1990.67 E:0.101195 |  very serious period of extra time.
[7624.48 - 7626.48] P:1905.91 E:0.093996 |  They've got to be very serious
[7626.48 - 7628.48] P:1759.48 E:0.040787 |  about the game.
[7628.48 - 7630.48] P:1789.86 E:0.092169 |  I think the Germans are very
[7630.48 - 7632.48] P:1644.99 E:0.072346 |  good.
[7632.48 - 7634.48] P:1772.17 E:0.095015 |  The ball, Mulla gives chase,
[7634.48 - 7636.48] P:1845.34 E:0.107058 |  Kukaraya alert, covers.
[7636.48 - 7638.48] P:1883.86 E:0.098607 |  It goes to Oona Sima.
[7638.48 - 7640.48] P:1919.99 E:0.101932 |  Clears it long.
[7640.48 - 7642.48] P:1951.14 E:0.090538 |  Headed forward by Anton.
[7642.48 - 7644.48] P:1801.24 E:0.108060 |  There's hardly
[7644.48 - 7646.48] P:1877.91 E:0.092350 |  any prep inside this stadium.
[7646.48 - 7648.48] P:1782.66 E:0.105453 |  They're four around there.
[7648.48 - 7650.48] P:1852.38 E:0.100533 |  For a certain age, it has to be said
[7650.48 - 7652.48] P:1942.04 E:0.084205 |  as well. They're feeling it.
[7652.48 - 7654.48] P:1842.38 E:0.094853 |  You can see Crosses is feeling it to some degree
[7654.48 - 7656.48] P:1821.67 E:0.080105 |  as well. But it doesn't matter.
[7656.48 - 7658.48] P:1765.47 E:0.114091 |  You have to keep on going. There are very few options left.
[7658.48 - 7660.48] P:1939.41 E:0.088923 |  Attention being cranked up
[7660.48 - 7662.48] P:1839.83 E:0.104284 |  as well. Carvajal could be
[7662.48 - 7664.48] P:1848.50 E:0.115164 |  showing a yellow card for handball here.
[7664.48 - 7666.48] P:1957.48 E:0.094457 |  Denny Carvajal will miss
[7666.48 - 7668.48] P:1906.39 E:0.067713 |  the semi-final.
[7668.48 - 7670.48] P:1992.87 E:0.108787 |  So all of a sudden, if Spain do go through,
[7670.48 - 7672.48] P:1880.35 E:0.078726 |  they've lost half of that
[7672.48 - 7674.48] P:1903.22 E:0.092527 |  back four that has really been quite a
[7674.48 - 7676.48] P:1788.47 E:0.087531 |  battle defence, with the exception of when they made
[7676.48 - 7678.48] P:1885.87 E:0.090950 |  the 10 changes against Albania
[7678.48 - 7680.48] P:1810.11 E:0.089470 |  because Le Normand and Carvajal
[7680.48 - 7682.48] P:1908.61 E:0.089282 |  will both miss the semi-final
[7682.48 - 7684.48] P:1790.90 E:0.099556 |  in Munich. I was going to suggest
[7684.48 - 7686.48] P:1745.40 E:0.098737 |  he can't have a complaint.
[7686.48 - 7688.48] P:1932.84 E:0.089176 |  But he absolutely
[7688.48 - 7690.48] P:1843.50 E:0.101406 |  deserved that. He knew exactly
[7690.48 - 7692.48] P:1871.15 E:0.096423 |  what he was doing.
[7692.48 - 7694.48] P:1829.98 E:0.104484 |  He got his hand up, stopped the ball going through.
[7694.48 - 7696.48] P:1873.48 E:0.080121 |  He didn't want to chase back there.
[7696.48 - 7698.48] P:1827.59 E:0.087029 |  He's going to miss the next one if they get through.
[7698.48 - 7700.48] P:1937.30 E:0.068445 |  Germany are attacking.
[7700.48 - 7702.48] P:1916.33 E:0.082169 |  Middlesfield far side.
[7702.48 - 7704.48] P:1963.55 E:0.089140 |  Moussiala in field to Wirtz.
[7704.48 - 7706.48] P:1837.42 E:0.110294 |  Moussiala wants the return ball.
[7706.48 - 7708.48] P:1861.96 E:0.100780 |  He finds it. He darts towards the byline, pulls it back,
[7708.48 - 7710.48] P:1853.30 E:0.101844 |  beaten out of the near post by Simon.
[7710.48 - 7712.48] P:1824.67 E:0.103879 |  And then there's little shrug.
[7712.48 - 7714.48] P:1774.58 E:0.104040 |  Header away by Kukareya.
[7714.48 - 7716.48] P:1907.00 E:0.109820 |  Andric has a swing at that with a right footed volley
[7716.48 - 7718.48] P:1966.38 E:0.090677 |  on the edge of the area. Absolutely skyd it.
[7718.48 - 7720.48] P:1754.95 E:0.106416 |  Gold kick, 1-1. Simon has to be very,
[7720.48 - 7722.48] P:1778.85 E:0.098782 |  very careful there. He's going to try and collect a ball
[7722.48 - 7724.48] P:1845.49 E:0.093345 |  that was coming from a real distance, from a real height.
[7724.48 - 7726.48] P:1675.84 E:0.087751 |  You know, look to me as if he's
[7726.48 - 7728.48] P:1774.36 E:0.084770 |  certainly pushed somebody there.
[7728.48 - 7730.48] P:1667.22 E:0.084237 |  But was it a red or a white shot that he's pushed?
[7730.48 - 7732.48] P:1864.18 E:0.080885 |  Actually, I'll give him a cheer.
[7732.48 - 7734.48] P:1853.50 E:0.078020 |  And I think was it full crew?
[7734.48 - 7736.48] P:1909.67 E:0.107501 |  Tried to get in front of him to make sure
[7736.48 - 7738.48] P:2011.50 E:0.105515 |  he couldn't get the ball.
[7738.48 - 7740.48] P:2036.63 E:0.105470 |  Talking about tired players.
[7740.48 - 7742.48] P:2099.37 E:0.105216 |  Fabian is down at the moment.
[7742.48 - 7744.48] P:2027.03 E:0.088105 |  Is that a touch of cramp?
[7744.48 - 7746.48] P:2089.15 E:0.093169 |  Spain have still got two opportunities to...
[7746.48 - 7748.48] P:1971.14 E:0.086988 |  Well, they've got two more players to potentially bring on.
[7748.48 - 7750.48] P:1986.04 E:0.078436 |  I thought they only had one.
[7750.48 - 7752.48] P:1843.94 E:0.073268 |  Must have got that wrong.
[7752.48 - 7754.48] P:1899.10 E:0.082753 |  They've brought on Nacho Moreno,
[7754.48 - 7756.48] P:1920.33 E:0.102358 |  Olmo, Ayers Sabel, they'll get the extra one in.
[7756.48 - 7758.48] P:1900.05 E:0.092292 |  In extra time.
[7758.48 - 7760.48] P:1819.96 E:0.067352 |  Yes, there's the one they're going to go for, I think.
[7760.48 - 7762.48] P:1871.76 E:0.050048 |  May have to get half a chance, we shall see.
[7762.48 - 7764.48] P:1621.20 E:0.103452 |  Talking about a story.
[7764.48 - 7766.48] P:1830.77 E:0.084108 |  Born in Stuttgart, Hossaloo.
[7766.48 - 7768.48] P:1742.70 E:0.075483 |  Could it be a fairy tale
[7768.48 - 7770.48] P:1825.74 E:0.087812 |  for Hossaloo and his hometown?
[7770.48 - 7772.48] P:1858.22 E:0.073746 |  We've just seen Mussiala.
[7772.48 - 7774.48] P:1911.41 E:0.089691 |  Likewise, born in Stuttgart,
[7774.48 - 7776.48] P:1864.96 E:0.090297 |  trying to create some magic.
[7776.48 - 7779.48] P:1831.80 E:0.100651 |  But Fabian, who for me has been one of the standout players
[7779.48 - 7781.48] P:1799.19 E:0.093895 |  for Spain in this tournament,
[7781.48 - 7783.48] P:1851.46 E:0.103919 |  is going to be coming off.
[7783.48 - 7785.48] P:1947.44 E:0.099039 |  He turns to Alonso Mourinho,
[7785.48 - 7787.48] P:1878.58 E:0.090884 |  who is going to be coming off.
[7787.48 - 7789.48] P:1904.77 E:0.090921 |  He turns to acknowledge the Spanish crowd
[7789.48 - 7791.48] P:1713.19 E:0.108444 |  away towards our right-hand side.
[7791.48 - 7793.48] P:1645.65 E:0.082682 |  Olias Sabel, I would imagine,
[7793.48 - 7795.48] P:1754.85 E:0.105252 |  will just drop a little bit deeper.
[7795.48 - 7798.48] P:1822.82 E:0.095904 |  But Hossaloo, five goals in his 12 appearances.
[7798.48 - 7800.48] P:1807.92 E:0.087191 |  Second appearance of this tournament.
[7800.48 - 7802.48] P:1747.05 E:0.108362 |  He did start against Albania.
[7802.48 - 7804.48] P:1882.44 E:0.087935 |  Hossaloo comes on.
[7804.48 - 7808.48] P:1960.70 E:0.088942 |  Made his international debut at the age of 32.
[7808.48 - 7810.48] P:2022.55 E:0.081171 |  Just a couple of years ago,
[7810.48 - 7812.48] P:1835.56 E:0.079210 |  he scored within two minutes.
[7812.48 - 7814.48] P:1809.92 E:0.069001 |  He comes on for Spain.
[7814.48 - 7816.48] P:1684.73 E:0.092001 |  One-one in extra time.
[7816.48 - 7818.48] P:1857.87 E:0.088431 |  Five live and BBC sounds.
[7818.48 - 7820.48] P:1879.53 E:0.075776 |  The first of the quarterfinals
[7820.48 - 7822.48] P:1960.45 E:0.093416 |  that you'll hear all on five live
[7822.48 - 7824.48] P:1840.23 E:0.082396 |  and BBC sounds over the weekend.
[7824.48 - 7826.48] P:1766.42 E:0.067161 |  In and around Wimbledon,
[7826.48 - 7828.48] P:1776.50 E:0.067868 |  Coverage, the rugby union test.
[7828.48 - 7830.48] P:1906.73 E:0.091586 |  First thing in the morning,
[7830.48 - 7832.48] P:1878.32 E:0.088598 |  England, Switzerland,
[7832.48 - 7834.48] P:1913.85 E:0.080052 |  at Düsseldorf, five o'clock tomorrow.
[7834.48 - 7836.48] P:1857.75 E:0.060394 |  And the British Grand Prix on Sunday as well.
[7836.48 - 7838.48] P:1779.45 E:0.071856 |  Is Andriak out of play?
[7838.48 - 7840.48] P:1759.64 E:0.089847 |  No fouls, says Anthony Taylor.
[7840.48 - 7842.48] P:1864.69 E:0.112099 |  It'll be a great game.
[7842.48 - 7844.48] P:1838.89 E:0.085942 |  And the first half of the season,
[7844.48 - 7846.48] P:1942.43 E:0.092270 |  is Anthony Taylor.
[7846.48 - 7849.48] P:1965.68 E:0.083773 |  It'll be a Spain throw-in down below.
[7849.48 - 7851.48] P:1810.17 E:0.091649 |  We have about two minutes remaining
[7851.48 - 7853.48] P:1864.75 E:0.083712 |  of this first period of extra time.
[7853.48 - 7855.48] P:1664.63 E:0.100391 |  Yeah, but I'm not sure that he would have chosen
[7855.48 - 7857.48] P:1852.25 E:0.090722 |  Hossaloo to come on just now.
[7857.48 - 7860.48] P:1842.24 E:0.089359 |  He has chosen, and I think he makes him look a lot better.
[7860.48 - 7862.48] P:1905.26 E:0.092605 |  A bit stronger.
[7862.48 - 7864.48] P:1887.49 E:0.085732 |  They've got a focal point now up top there
[7864.48 - 7866.48] P:1849.64 E:0.089572 |  for them to have to play a long ball.
[7866.48 - 7868.48] P:2004.34 E:0.054019 |  They can play to him, so that's actually
[7868.48 - 7870.48] P:1897.88 E:0.073806 |  the main work for the Spanish.
[7870.48 - 7872.48] P:1824.64 E:0.080303 |  He's up there, and of course,
[7872.48 - 7875.48] P:1834.49 E:0.102770 |  being marked by Rudiger as the shot comes in from distance.
[7875.48 - 7878.48] P:1665.32 E:0.092471 |  It was from Oya Sabel, who hit it
[7878.48 - 7880.48] P:1871.98 E:0.088129 |  outside the penalty area, left footed,
[7880.48 - 7882.48] P:1775.06 E:0.095240 |  and it whistled wide for a goal kick.
[7882.48 - 7885.48] P:1764.40 E:0.096064 |  I'll tell you what, Noyar wasn't comfortable there, was he?
[7885.48 - 7887.48] P:1833.87 E:0.088063 |  He's scampering across his goal there.
[7887.48 - 7889.48] P:1769.31 E:0.096539 |  He must have seen it quite late as well.
[7889.48 - 7891.48] P:1870.70 E:0.080770 |  And it's just bounced before his hand.
[7891.48 - 7894.48] P:1601.75 E:0.100827 |  He wasn't getting to him because it bounced under him.
[7894.48 - 7896.48] P:1727.07 E:0.073671 |  And I think we're very relieved, man,
[7896.48 - 7898.48] P:1705.51 E:0.087168 |  it went past that back post.
[7898.48 - 7901.48] P:1989.02 E:0.094420 |  But as Georgia, this first period of extra time,
[7901.48 - 7904.48] P:1902.13 E:0.102070 |  totally unlike the 25 minutes before that,
[7904.48 - 7906.48] P:1952.34 E:0.086707 |  Spain would be the better side.
[7908.48 - 7912.48] P:1893.20 E:0.088942 |  1-1, Noyar goes long.
[7912.48 - 7915.48] P:1813.53 E:0.107552 |  Rodgerie tries to throw Muller out of the way,
[7915.48 - 7919.48] P:1818.72 E:0.085942 |  as the ball is tidied up by La Porte back to Ounai Simon,
[7919.48 - 7924.48] P:1832.67 E:0.076557 |  who has a very good record when it comes to saving penalties
[7924.48 - 7926.48] P:1796.28 E:0.068682 |  in shootouts.
[7926.48 - 7928.48] P:1833.33 E:0.078189 |  Will it go that far?
[7928.48 - 7930.48] P:1910.87 E:0.077536 |  Pat thinks not.
[7930.48 - 7932.48] P:1930.01 E:0.078605 |  For the time being, at least,
[7932.48 - 7935.48] P:1846.77 E:0.087630 |  Mussiola over the halfway line.
[7935.48 - 7937.48] P:1860.95 E:0.091905 |  Andric coming forward for Germany.
[7937.48 - 7939.48] P:1813.65 E:0.090455 |  By my watch, we're inside the last 60 seconds
[7939.48 - 7942.48] P:1920.56 E:0.077743 |  of the first period of extra time.
[7942.48 - 7945.48] P:1860.34 E:0.070608 |  Taser slowed down, Croce passes the ball out
[7945.48 - 7947.48] P:1923.48 E:0.084769 |  towards Middleshaw.
[7947.48 - 7949.48] P:1780.53 E:0.080649 |  The left back gets it back for Germany,
[7949.48 - 7951.48] P:1819.82 E:0.086920 |  back in field to Croce once again.
[7951.48 - 7953.48] P:1842.71 E:0.100554 |  Every outfield player in the half away towards
[7953.48 - 7955.48] P:1863.90 E:0.100580 |  our right-hand side.
[7955.48 - 7957.48] P:1909.15 E:0.090967 |  He tries to get away from Hosselut.
[7957.48 - 7961.48] P:1913.15 E:0.088398 |  The two Real Madrid players, shoulder to shoulder.
[7961.48 - 7964.48] P:1926.70 E:0.087941 |  Rudiger back with Anton.
[7964.48 - 7966.48] P:1939.94 E:0.098000 |  Germany's turn now to see a lot of the ball.
[7966.48 - 7971.48] P:1862.54 E:0.077005 |  Rudiger passes the ball all the way back to Noyar.
[7973.48 - 7975.48] P:1852.05 E:0.111357 |  Just looking at Rudiger there.
[7975.48 - 7977.48] P:1796.89 E:0.096408 |  He looked to me injured,
[7977.48 - 7979.48] P:1894.87 E:0.075046 |  but 10 minutes to go in normal time,
[7979.48 - 7981.48] P:1721.30 E:0.104654 |  but he's kept on going.
[7981.48 - 7983.48] P:1807.27 E:0.085338 |  He was the player, if you remember,
[7983.48 - 7985.48] P:1587.98 E:0.099550 |  who was the first to go into the right-hand side
[7985.48 - 7987.48] P:1920.86 E:0.079874 |  and got the first ball in.
[7987.48 - 7989.48] P:1988.27 E:0.109701 |  So he'll be happy.
[7989.48 - 7991.48] P:1789.92 E:0.120035 |  Opportunity here, Nuller.
[7991.48 - 7993.48] P:1802.17 E:0.103978 |  Verzolli was close.
[7993.48 - 7995.48] P:1677.98 E:0.106339 |  Hitted first time left-footed,
[7995.48 - 7997.48] P:1593.84 E:0.115970 |  but it was always going away from goal
[7997.48 - 7999.48] P:1961.97 E:0.086249 |  of that right-hand post,
[7999.48 - 8001.48] P:1983.61 E:0.106925 |  but that was almost an opportunity
[8001.48 - 8003.48] P:1812.65 E:0.103097 |  for Germany to take the lead.
[8003.48 - 8005.48] P:1888.79 E:0.096911 |  Carbon copy of the Spanish goal.
[8005.48 - 8007.48] P:1876.56 E:0.101497 |  Almost exactly the same move.
[8007.48 - 8009.48] P:1886.72 E:0.076455 |  Coming from the other side, though,
[8009.48 - 8011.48] P:1876.96 E:0.094040 |  passed towards the back post,
[8011.48 - 8013.48] P:1844.08 E:0.099892 |  but he was almost able to go there.
[8013.48 - 8015.48] P:1801.15 E:0.092338 |  And this time he wasn't able to do that.
[8015.48 - 8017.48] P:1748.55 E:0.094641 |  And a good move there for the Germans.
[8017.48 - 8019.48] P:1937.78 E:0.090319 |  Their best moment of these 15 minutes,
[8019.48 - 8021.48] P:1936.40 E:0.096983 |  and they've got one minute extra.
[8023.48 - 8026.48] P:1985.34 E:0.101368 |  It's tense here in Stuttgart.
[8026.48 - 8029.48] P:2103.91 E:0.111669 |  Una Simon, who's already been shown a yellow card
[8029.48 - 8031.48] P:2022.48 E:0.111694 |  for time-wasting in no real hurry,
[8031.48 - 8034.48] P:2000.81 E:0.090152 |  were inside the 60 seconds of added-on time.
[8034.48 - 8037.48] P:1689.01 E:0.054090 |  Andric heads it away,
[8037.48 - 8039.48] P:1765.49 E:0.082336 |  repelled by the head of Le Port.
[8039.48 - 8042.48] P:1835.96 E:0.089221 |  Andric then again climbs to head it further away,
[8042.48 - 8044.48] P:1810.73 E:0.063892 |  comes back, like head tennis at the moment,
[8044.48 - 8046.48] P:1773.31 E:0.079845 |  it won't come down, and then eventually it does,
[8046.48 - 8048.48] P:1733.32 E:0.097771 |  and there's a big up-and-under from Rudiger.
[8048.48 - 8051.48] P:1894.27 E:0.087958 |  That was no nonsense from Rudiger.
[8051.48 - 8054.48] P:1869.18 E:0.103875 |  That was a clearance that Peter Kaye would be proud of.
[8054.48 - 8056.48] P:1922.14 E:0.084192 |  David, out of play, goes for a throw.
[8056.48 - 8058.48] P:1922.98 E:0.099494 |  End of the extra-time first period, 1-1.
[8058.48 - 8060.48] P:1834.60 E:0.097482 |  Yeah, and it's...
[8060.48 - 8062.48] P:1642.38 E:0.097834 |  I've done too well done spin.
[8062.48 - 8064.48] P:1727.00 E:0.092282 |  Going self-backhand, they were clinging on.
[8064.48 - 8067.48] P:1609.37 E:0.099860 |  Obviously, the list of all very, very late-on in the game.
[8067.48 - 8069.48] P:1661.92 E:0.088554 |  Psychologically, it was a hard one to take.
[8069.48 - 8071.48] P:1630.55 E:0.099136 |  They were under all sorts of pressure.
[8071.48 - 8073.48] P:1740.28 E:0.085660 |  They couldn't get out of their own half.
[8073.48 - 8076.48] P:1652.07 E:0.097897 |  They had the break, and suddenly they came back a lot stronger.
[8076.48 - 8078.48] P:1495.25 E:0.093357 |  Held the ball really well,
[8078.48 - 8080.48] P:1602.22 E:0.092579 |  and they were the better team for 15 minutes.
[8080.48 - 8083.48] P:1708.37 E:0.089762 |  They were out, you know, destroying the Germans.
[8083.48 - 8085.48] P:1683.86 E:0.093411 |  And you wonder at this point in time,
[8085.48 - 8088.48] P:1620.39 E:0.087952 |  I mean, I don't think it's impossible that our penalties, obviously.
[8088.48 - 8090.48] P:1669.59 E:0.085474 |  Just thought there might be more chances.
[8090.48 - 8093.48] P:1726.88 E:0.085934 |  Who would you think would want the penalties more?
[8093.48 - 8096.48] P:1685.71 E:0.083757 |  You would imagine the Germans are quite comfortable.
[8096.48 - 8098.48] P:1780.94 E:0.094834 |  They've had the bad teams as well.
[8098.48 - 8101.48] P:1696.12 E:0.085952 |  But the Spanish record with penalties isn't brilliant, is it?
[8101.48 - 8103.48] P:1648.86 E:0.085395 |  No, it's not. Will we get there?
[8103.48 - 8106.48] P:1608.43 E:0.089144 |  We'll find out in about 15 minutes' time. Kelly.
[8106.48 - 8108.48] P:1666.00 E:0.109018 |  Thank you very much to Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin.
[8108.48 - 8109.48] P:1789.11 E:0.093603 |  Back very shortly.
[8109.48 - 8111.48] P:1756.35 E:0.100329 |  Emma Radikano is in action at Wimbledon.
[8111.48 - 8113.48] P:1846.47 E:0.087855 |  Ian Carter's watching.
[8113.48 - 8117.48] P:1903.02 E:0.096782 |  And she's one game away from a second appearance in her career
[8117.48 - 8119.48] P:1710.92 E:0.090790 |  in the fourth round at Wimbledon.
[8119.48 - 8123.48] P:1828.17 E:0.092600 |  That break of serve early in the second set has been consolidated.
[8123.48 - 8127.48] P:1754.98 E:0.087571 |  She leads it against Maria Sacarri, the ninth seed from Greece,
[8127.48 - 8129.48] P:1977.25 E:0.101233 |  by five games to three.
[8129.48 - 8132.48] P:1738.34 E:0.102964 |  So Sacarri's serving to stay in Wimbledon.
[8132.48 - 8134.48] P:1742.56 E:0.104717 |  And she's currently at love 30, Kelly.
[8134.48 - 8137.48] P:1675.64 E:0.109483 |  So things looking very encouraging for Emma Radikano.
[8137.48 - 8141.48] P:1620.25 E:0.100370 |  Ian Carter's going to keep us up to date with everything that happens there.
[8141.48 - 8145.48] P:1737.56 E:0.092835 |  And remember that there is full coverage of Wimbledon on sports extra.
[8145.48 - 8149.48] P:1685.88 E:0.105665 |  Our commentary match is here on Five Life Sport this evening
[8149.48 - 8151.48] P:1885.68 E:0.089569 |  and all the way through from this afternoon.
[8151.48 - 8154.48] P:1750.74 E:0.103729 |  First of all, in Stuttgart, we're going to head back for penalties
[8154.48 - 8157.48] P:1828.93 E:0.102052 |  very shortly in the game between Spain and Germany.
[8157.48 - 8161.48] P:1860.45 E:0.096420 |  And then from eight o'clock, it's commentary of France against Portugal,
[8161.48 - 8164.48] P:1765.38 E:0.097666 |  the match that's being built as a baffé against Ronaldo.
[8164.48 - 8166.48] P:1797.56 E:0.091499 |  But which one will come out on top?
[8166.48 - 8170.48] P:1708.03 E:0.094627 |  Let's head back to Stuttgart now with Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis.
[8170.48 - 8172.48] P:1778.46 E:0.108350 |  Pat, by the way, you were right.
[8172.48 - 8174.48] P:1934.83 E:0.097699 |  They have actually used six, the Spanish.
[8174.48 - 8175.48] P:1622.28 E:0.086946 |  I kind of thought that.
[8175.48 - 8177.48] P:1691.58 E:0.091343 |  Because I was looking at players thinking,
[8177.48 - 8179.48] P:1664.88 E:0.102310 |  well, you can't get injured now.
[8179.48 - 8181.48] P:1646.85 E:0.077957 |  But they're still in the pitch.
[8181.48 - 8183.48] P:1607.86 E:0.110377 |  And there are so many tired players out there just now
[8183.48 - 8186.48] P:1683.04 E:0.086663 |  that it would be no surprise in these last 15 minutes
[8186.48 - 8189.48] P:1665.46 E:0.091931 |  of play that somebody will basically be hobbling.
[8189.48 - 8192.48] P:1773.57 E:0.073614 |  You'll have to stick them up front and just say, be a nuisance.
[8192.48 - 8197.48] P:1756.67 E:0.085208 |  But at the moment, there are 11 fit-ish players left on either side
[8197.48 - 8199.48] P:1891.79 E:0.084283 |  and no substitute options left.
[8199.48 - 8202.48] P:1915.39 E:0.101262 |  So they've used both teams, they've used their full entitlement
[8202.48 - 8205.48] P:1896.90 E:0.096571 |  as the second period of extra time is underway.
[8205.48 - 8208.48] P:1986.31 E:0.101983 |  You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds
[8208.48 - 8211.48] P:1861.03 E:0.079783 |  where they're going to Stuttgart, where this first quarter final,
[8211.48 - 8214.48] P:1820.88 E:0.080802 |  the Euros has gone to extra time.
[8214.48 - 8217.48] P:1736.89 E:0.082414 |  And if there's not to be another goal in the next quarter of an hour,
[8217.48 - 8219.48] P:1775.23 E:0.087342 |  we'll have a penalty shootout.
[8219.48 - 8221.48] P:1767.91 E:0.080509 |  There's Mussiala.
[8221.48 - 8224.48] P:1844.19 E:0.099712 |  Over the halfway line runs from Moreno.
[8224.48 - 8226.48] P:1924.30 E:0.073446 |  Forward ball to Wirtz.
[8226.48 - 8229.48] P:1915.90 E:0.096016 |  Muller's forward ball, Falkerug off the chest, tries to turn
[8229.48 - 8231.48] P:1862.86 E:0.098327 |  with his back to goal, pulls it back, Mussiala.
[8231.48 - 8233.48] P:1814.37 E:0.120292 |  They appeal for handball.
[8233.48 - 8237.48] P:1912.64 E:0.105639 |  There was strong penalty appeals there by Germany.
[8237.48 - 8240.48] P:1953.72 E:0.111424 |  So much so that when the ball then bounced to the edge of the area,
[8240.48 - 8242.48] P:1933.28 E:0.099826 |  none of them went to strike it.
[8242.48 - 8246.48] P:1960.29 E:0.086780 |  They all just shouted at Anthony Taylor from Mussiala's effort.
[8246.48 - 8249.48] P:1889.87 E:0.082166 |  He's going to give that. That's a stick on.
[8249.48 - 8253.48] P:1846.03 E:0.110745 |  Ehler on, Cuccarella was very, very fortunate for me to go away with one.
[8253.48 - 8258.48] P:1892.29 E:0.082927 |  His hand is low, but it's out to the side.
[8258.48 - 8260.48] P:1985.06 E:0.108066 |  Wow, he's not giving it.
[8260.48 - 8263.48] P:2011.15 E:0.084611 |  He's not giving it. Are you surprised with that?
[8263.48 - 8265.48] P:1845.66 E:0.108076 |  I didn't think it was deliberate handball.
[8265.48 - 8267.48] P:1848.76 E:0.086589 |  It's not deliberate.
[8267.48 - 8269.48] P:1817.24 E:0.094938 |  But when you look at some of the decisions that have been given by UEFA,
[8269.48 - 8272.48] P:1874.00 E:0.088335 |  when it normally strikes the hand, as here is Muller,
[8272.48 - 8274.48] P:1809.78 E:0.090769 |  Muller, edge of the area,
[8274.48 - 8276.48] P:1869.95 E:0.095869 |  Andric back out towards the left-hand side,
[8276.48 - 8281.48] P:1941.93 E:0.091481 |  Stuart Atwell was on VAR, Mussiala's shot saved by Seymour.
[8281.48 - 8284.48] P:1933.57 E:0.080511 |  But as you said, it was low down.
[8284.48 - 8287.48] P:1888.48 E:0.089448 |  But it was out from his body, and you'll see,
[8287.48 - 8290.48] P:1917.66 E:0.088791 |  that's not an unnatural possession, all that sort of stuff, right?
[8290.48 - 8292.48] P:1948.90 E:0.106382 |  But it was quite far out from his body,
[8292.48 - 8294.48] P:2019.84 E:0.106397 |  and it was maybe heading towards the goal.
[8294.48 - 8296.48] P:1998.55 E:0.092766 |  Maybe that's where he came down to.
[8296.48 - 8299.48] P:1823.43 E:0.095099 |  If it's not heading towards the goal, if it was heading just way,
[8299.48 - 8301.48] P:1770.41 E:0.083078 |  there's a shot on, not on target,
[8301.48 - 8304.48] P:1582.16 E:0.087074 |  maybe that made the decision for him, but that was a big call.
[8304.48 - 8308.48] P:1803.19 E:0.077261 |  Well, certainly, here is Cuccarella.
[8308.48 - 8310.48] P:1898.76 E:0.101432 |  Could have escaped, maybe, for Spain.
[8310.48 - 8316.48] P:1847.97 E:0.096796 |  Two minutes into this second period of extra time, still at 1-1.
[8316.48 - 8320.48] P:1844.60 E:0.101217 |  Rodgerick passes the ball to La Porte.
[8321.48 - 8326.48] P:1885.22 E:0.099205 |  This is Moreno coming onto it on the left-hand side.
[8326.48 - 8329.48] P:1822.95 E:0.093855 |  Cuccarella waits, level with the penalty area.
[8329.48 - 8333.48] P:1835.49 E:0.097173 |  Olmo tries to get away from Andric, drops his shoulder, accelerates,
[8333.48 - 8335.48] P:1937.70 E:0.090175 |  passes the ball forward, Cross comes in from the left,
[8335.48 - 8339.48] P:1881.66 E:0.108426 |  Rudiger on the stretch, prevents it from reaching Hossilou behind for a corner kick.
[8339.48 - 8340.48] P:1812.46 E:0.097063 |  One-wap!
[8340.48 - 8343.48] P:1870.52 E:0.105785 |  Very toned, Rudiger. Last-ditched tackle, isn't it?
[8343.48 - 8346.48] P:1820.75 E:0.107615 |  He's on the ground. If he doesn't get it, it's probably a goal there.
[8346.48 - 8348.48] P:1863.90 E:0.075083 |  He's passed through, there's...
[8348.48 - 8352.48] P:1788.78 E:0.088791 |  And Hossilou's going in the back, yeah, he's going in the back there.
[8352.48 - 8354.48] P:1712.84 E:0.097206 |  He might have got in the end of it, but still a corner kick,
[8354.48 - 8357.48] P:1865.06 E:0.085193 |  still an opportunity, Spain. Can't call this one.
[8357.48 - 8360.48] P:1963.21 E:0.093442 |  Two Spanish flags fly high behind that goal.
[8360.48 - 8364.48] P:1901.71 E:0.083569 |  As Spain have a corner kick far side the left, and it comes now.
[8364.48 - 8368.48] P:1888.35 E:0.094604 |  It's deep, headed back by La Porte, cleared by Germany to Mussiala,
[8368.48 - 8371.48] P:1887.47 E:0.104178 |  able to turn. He's only got Virts ahead of him, he finds him.
[8371.48 - 8373.48] P:1875.91 E:0.107957 |  And Mussiala now is showing the attack.
[8373.48 - 8375.48] P:1884.76 E:0.101873 |  Kukereya has to get back.
[8375.48 - 8377.48] P:1909.27 E:0.098587 |  Virts running at the heart of the Spain defence.
[8377.48 - 8380.48] P:1958.39 E:0.097485 |  Mussiala wants it to feed, Virts is going alone, he pulls it back.
[8380.48 - 8382.48] P:1942.65 E:0.103697 |  It's his full crook!
[8382.48 - 8385.48] P:1918.81 E:0.104762 |  Left foot, it shoots wide off target, goal kick, one-wap.
[8385.48 - 8388.48] P:1904.82 E:0.092979 |  But we have talked a few times about Kukereya.
[8388.48 - 8391.48] P:1847.93 E:0.104283 |  He was brilliant now. Absolutely brilliant.
[8391.48 - 8394.48] P:1859.39 E:0.091581 |  The pace he showed to get back, and he didn't dive in,
[8394.48 - 8397.48] P:1761.41 E:0.107549 |  he just held up players as much as possible, held up Virts,
[8397.48 - 8400.48] P:1867.27 E:0.088705 |  he goes to Fulcruc, there's still a half a chance there,
[8400.48 - 8403.48] P:1818.70 E:0.096009 |  but by that time they got the players back, and we all know that Fulcruc,
[8403.48 - 8405.48] P:1984.13 E:0.064004 |  he can hit a ball.
[8405.48 - 8408.48] P:1926.88 E:0.098820 |  Hasn't Virts had much more of an impact than Leroy Sane?
[8408.48 - 8412.48] P:2012.30 E:0.106025 |  Yeah, absolutely, but then sometimes if you're a wide player,
[8412.48 - 8415.48] P:2005.78 E:0.106376 |  it's easier to come on the centre after referees,
[8415.48 - 8417.48] P:1976.75 E:0.110308 |  you see doing just that, he's having a ward.
[8417.48 - 8421.48] P:1923.53 E:0.095980 |  Is there another ball behind the goal, so it's got to be cleared?
[8421.48 - 8423.48] P:1893.30 E:0.094781 |  That's the new one I see him on the favour,
[8423.48 - 8426.48] P:1925.21 E:0.099342 |  because he was taking his time yet again.
[8426.48 - 8429.48] P:1988.56 E:0.107553 |  He's already on a yellow card, let's not forget.
[8429.48 - 8432.48] P:1975.62 E:0.109012 |  Yeah, we're talking about Virts, when you come on the second half,
[8432.48 - 8435.48] P:2042.38 E:0.093231 |  there's probably more space than the first half,
[8435.48 - 8438.48] P:1806.80 E:0.083197 |  so it's kind of harder for the wide attacking players,
[8438.48 - 8441.48] P:1742.15 E:0.055308 |  but yeah, in short, he's done far more than Sane.
[8441.48 - 8444.48] P:1870.51 E:0.096486 |  Downfield it goes, Rudiger should tidy this one up,
[8444.48 - 8447.48] P:1793.83 E:0.087192 |  back towards his goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer,
[8447.48 - 8450.48] P:1804.51 E:0.097253 |  had to really dig that out as he fell backwards,
[8450.48 - 8454.48] P:1880.55 E:0.109454 |  got a lot of lift on it, Mulla gets in a bit of a tangy with Rodgery,
[8454.48 - 8458.48] P:1911.96 E:0.098604 |  they're appealing for a yellow card, and they get one.
[8458.48 - 8461.48] P:1928.78 E:0.086625 |  Rodgery, who has already been actually suspended,
[8461.48 - 8463.48] P:1918.94 E:0.088621 |  he missed the Albania game, not that he would have played,
[8463.48 - 8465.48] P:1857.99 E:0.077784 |  because they made so many changes,
[8465.48 - 8467.48] P:1867.21 E:0.090647 |  but he gets yet another yellow card in this tournament,
[8467.48 - 8469.48] P:1763.47 E:0.094458 |  he knew exactly what he was doing.
[8469.48 - 8471.48] P:1858.63 E:0.091208 |  I think we've all seen that one before from Rodgery,
[8471.48 - 8474.48] P:1858.96 E:0.090543 |  when he knows he's not going to get back,
[8474.48 - 8476.48] P:1719.28 E:0.093636 |  he's calculated, we've got all on his mind,
[8476.48 - 8479.48] P:1919.82 E:0.078109 |  not on a yellow card yet, just put it out with it, take the yellow.
[8479.48 - 8482.48] P:1964.14 E:0.099266 |  Rudiger with a free kick, still 1-1 in Stuttgart,
[8482.48 - 8484.48] P:1901.59 E:0.092508 |  goes long, full crook, downward header,
[8484.48 - 8487.48] P:1828.52 E:0.084027 |  directs it to the feet of Mussiala, Mussiala hits this bobbly ball,
[8487.48 - 8491.48] P:1836.56 E:0.094798 |  towards Mulla, Mulla's cross is deep from the left-hand side,
[8491.48 - 8494.48] P:1833.94 E:0.093924 |  Kukere is going to be closed down by Kimmich,
[8494.48 - 8497.48] P:1894.05 E:0.099848 |  they go into a thunderous challenge,
[8497.48 - 8501.48] P:1933.72 E:0.106838 |  Kimmich really did catch Kukere, shoulder to shoulder,
[8501.48 - 8504.48] P:1981.87 E:0.097594 |  and Kukere is lying flat on his back.
[8504.48 - 8508.48] P:1917.62 E:0.093537 |  And this time Kukere has actually been hit in the head,
[8508.48 - 8510.48] P:1882.81 E:0.101770 |  and there was a sore one.
[8510.48 - 8515.48] P:1980.46 E:0.101925 |  To be honest, I definitely should have a lot of look at that one again.
[8515.48 - 8517.48] P:2028.26 E:0.117941 |  He would argue it was a 50-50, he's gone on far,
[8517.48 - 8519.48] P:2043.06 E:0.094050 |  but he was catapulted there.
[8519.48 - 8522.48] P:1934.67 E:0.087930 |  I think that's a horrendous touch.
[8522.48 - 8525.48] P:1929.80 E:0.092115 |  I think Kimmich knows exactly what he's doing there,
[8525.48 - 8529.48] P:1786.60 E:0.083531 |  his weight to play around, he's not even going for the ball,
[8529.48 - 8532.48] P:1813.50 E:0.074162 |  if he's got the ball he's got it with his arm.
[8532.48 - 8536.48] P:1830.59 E:0.104158 |  Not quite Schumacher against Batistone all those years ago,
[8536.48 - 8538.48] P:1845.56 E:0.108124 |  in the 82 World Cup.
[8538.48 - 8541.48] P:1786.88 E:0.102831 |  Yeah, it's a sad answer, I think, to be fair,
[8541.48 - 8544.48] P:1863.31 E:0.115200 |  it's a tough call for the referee, it's a lot of calls to the...
[8544.48 - 8548.48] P:1871.46 E:0.107417 |  There's a lot of pressure on, there's been a lot of extreme tackles in there,
[8548.48 - 8551.48] P:1842.95 E:0.091089 |  a lot of clever players playing out there as well.
[8551.48 - 8553.48] P:1829.38 E:0.078678 |  That one was tough.
[8553.48 - 8555.48] P:1840.87 E:0.093386 |  Let's go back to Wimbledon, Ian Carter.
[8555.48 - 8558.48] P:2083.20 E:0.097670 |  Emma Radikano is through to the last 16,
[8558.48 - 8561.48] P:1784.93 E:0.097410 |  she's won in straight sets against the ninth seed,
[8561.48 - 8565.48] P:1755.40 E:0.094751 |  Maria Sacari 6-2-6-3, only the second time in her career,
[8565.48 - 8567.48] P:1716.46 E:0.081294 |  she's beaten top ten opposition,
[8567.48 - 8569.48] P:1663.24 E:0.100347 |  and for the second time in her career,
[8569.48 - 8572.48] P:1685.46 E:0.071901 |  Radikano through to the last 16.
[8572.48 - 8575.48] P:1926.60 E:0.101102 |  Continues on, sports extra, Spain are attacking,
[8575.48 - 8578.48] P:1871.63 E:0.098384 |  Oya Sabel, man over on this near side level, the area's Ferran Torres,
[8578.48 - 8581.48] P:1909.71 E:0.096189 |  Torres with the cross, it hangs in the air,
[8581.48 - 8585.48] P:1941.78 E:0.090731 |  Rudiger heads it up, headed further away by Kimmich, still at 1-1.
[8585.48 - 8588.48] P:1858.03 E:0.105956 |  We've been playing for seven minutes of this second period of extra time,
[8588.48 - 8590.48] P:1967.88 E:0.094189 |  penalties looming.
[8590.48 - 8594.48] P:1872.48 E:0.105626 |  Germany there with a quick throw, Muller, full crook had come short,
[8594.48 - 8596.48] P:1854.56 E:0.084301 |  and he goes long, the move breaks down.
[8596.48 - 8599.48] P:1798.76 E:0.105282 |  They've just got a little bit more energy back again, they can feel it.
[8599.48 - 8602.48] P:1782.71 E:0.100286 |  There are a few players out there, they should have kicked it out there,
[8602.48 - 8605.48] P:1912.31 E:0.105112 |  the Gemmas, crosses on the ground, they're barely 10 men.
[8605.48 - 8610.48] P:1966.82 E:0.107501 |  Oya Sabel, edge of the area, Oya Sabel with a shot, left footed, always off target.
[8610.48 - 8614.48] P:1980.99 E:0.120787 |  He gets a little shove there by Andre, Rudiger also has a word,
[8614.48 - 8617.48] P:2058.51 E:0.108664 |  wasn't a head injury, he's more than entitled to play on.
[8617.48 - 8621.48] P:2055.23 E:0.104205 |  I have no idea why some players think they're that important,
[8621.48 - 8624.48] P:1952.55 E:0.090422 |  that the game should stop because they've got a little injury.
[8624.48 - 8627.48] P:1771.99 E:0.086732 |  You can't go down for that, it's not a major injury,
[8627.48 - 8630.48] P:1758.69 E:0.089024 |  it may well be cramped, in fact it is cramped,
[8630.48 - 8632.48] P:1776.50 E:0.080204 |  so why are you expecting the game to be stopped?
[8632.48 - 8634.48] P:1783.47 E:0.064991 |  It's a nonsense.
[8634.48 - 8639.48] P:1753.20 E:0.092129 |  I've been talking about it before, I thought everybody using all the substitutes
[8639.48 - 8642.48] P:1661.20 E:0.090427 |  that somebody might end up having to basically go and goal hang.
[8642.48 - 8644.48] P:1928.79 E:0.086467 |  Well it could well be Tony Kruse,
[8644.48 - 8648.48] P:1734.74 E:0.076580 |  because that sort of level of cramp there, right at the end of the game,
[8648.48 - 8650.48] P:1764.00 E:0.087706 |  you shall see if he's capable of carrying.
[8650.48 - 8653.48] P:1885.05 E:0.070756 |  Well, he has to carry on, there's no choice.
[8654.48 - 8657.48] P:1805.53 E:0.092524 |  Kruse is getting treatment for cramp,
[8657.48 - 8664.48] P:1751.69 E:0.085463 |  there is a lot of permitted to use any more substitutes at this stage,
[8664.48 - 8669.48] P:1923.89 E:0.098545 |  he's got to just battle on Tony Kruse if he wishes to add
[8669.48 - 8674.48] P:1921.11 E:0.098177 |  to his 33 trophies that he's picked up during his career,
[8674.48 - 8678.48] P:1894.12 E:0.092203 |  but we're halfway through the second period of extra time
[8678.48 - 8681.48] P:1826.46 E:0.090641 |  and we could be going the whole hog.
[8683.48 - 8688.48] P:1883.10 E:0.087918 |  I was just watching that penalty shoot against Kukerella again,
[8688.48 - 8691.48] P:1729.32 E:0.091392 |  but they've not shown us a good enough angle from behind the goal.
[8691.48 - 8695.48] P:1770.71 E:0.083401 |  If you see it from behind the goal, if it hits his hand and it's going towards goal,
[8695.48 - 8697.48] P:1749.15 E:0.066710 |  you'd expect them to give a penalty kick there.
[8697.48 - 8699.48] P:1692.87 E:0.091343 |  They've not shown a good enough angle to tell that yet.
[8699.48 - 8702.48] P:1900.79 E:0.089417 |  Meanwhile, Germany have had another player book,
[8702.48 - 8705.48] P:1926.92 E:0.083051 |  but it's another substitute, Schlotterbeck was booked earlier,
[8705.48 - 8708.48] P:1779.89 E:0.090457 |  but Brighton's Dennis Undab has been shown a yellow card
[8708.48 - 8712.48] P:1924.90 E:0.073190 |  for speaking out of turn to referee Anthony Taylor.
[8712.48 - 8715.48] P:1829.30 E:0.075757 |  So Undab has been booked.
[8715.48 - 8719.48] P:1866.05 E:0.092650 |  Get the calculator out for the bookings here, so many of them.
[8719.48 - 8724.48] P:1765.93 E:0.099025 |  13.
[8724.48 - 8729.48] P:1871.17 E:0.072106 |  Clearance from Neuer.
[8729.48 - 8733.48] P:1775.59 E:0.093684 |  That would have been a record in the history of the European Championships,
[8733.48 - 8739.48] P:1781.41 E:0.088075 |  had it not been for that contest between the Czech Republic and Turkey,
[8739.48 - 8743.48] P:1783.77 E:0.084986 |  but a combination of 19 cards, 17 yellows and two reds,
[8743.48 - 8747.48] P:1724.27 E:0.066013 |  was shown earlier on in the competition.
[8747.48 - 8750.48] P:1841.96 E:0.084257 |  Kukerella gets it out to the left-hand side.
[8750.48 - 8755.48] P:1863.26 E:0.079218 |  This is with Olmo on that far side, tries to turn away from André.
[8755.48 - 8759.48] P:1846.93 E:0.092619 |  Hosselou has come short, created a space for Moreno to run into.
[8759.48 - 8763.48] P:1892.53 E:0.094187 |  That was a sharp turn by Olmo, goes to ground, gets himself back to his feet.
[8763.48 - 8767.48] P:1922.32 E:0.088979 |  Olmo passes the ball, edge of the area, crosses there.
[8767.48 - 8770.48] P:1822.56 E:0.075986 |  André has gone back to the left-hand side.
[8770.48 - 8773.48] P:1713.28 E:0.091029 |  That was a close-up by Kymik.
[8773.48 - 8776.48] P:1901.80 E:0.085382 |  Clearance wasn't the best by Kymik,
[8776.48 - 8780.48] P:1875.43 E:0.058192 |  and Spain have got it back, with Olmo over on that far side yet again.
[8780.48 - 8783.48] P:1848.24 E:0.103520 |  Moreno with his short, dark hair, waits.
[8783.48 - 8788.48] P:1886.37 E:0.097442 |  Olmo still keeping it tight between themselves, very congested.
[8788.48 - 8792.48] P:1934.12 E:0.096031 |  Olmo is told to get to his feet as he was sent tumbling.
[8792.48 - 8796.48] P:1853.09 E:0.089640 |  Back it goes to Neuer, closed down by two Spanish players, sweep it long.
[8796.48 - 8798.48] P:1956.19 E:0.115027 |  André, Oonoh, Seymour.
[8798.48 - 8800.48] P:1945.27 E:0.113220 |  Seymour almost trying to do it just now.
[8800.48 - 8803.48] P:1961.55 E:0.100697 |  And again, Fouker allegedly off the ball.
[8803.48 - 8807.48] P:1934.39 E:0.101287 |  Slightly too many players going down too easily now, which is a bit infuriating.
[8807.48 - 8810.48] P:1903.16 E:0.114080 |  Again, it's a tough one for the referee.
[8810.48 - 8814.48] P:2047.20 E:0.109471 |  They're coming together, but as it is bad, as the players are suggesting it is,
[8814.48 - 8817.48] P:2078.38 E:0.111904 |  probably not most of the time.
[8817.48 - 8819.48] P:2018.25 E:0.103919 |  It has been feisty, hasn't it?
[8819.48 - 8821.48] P:2067.40 E:0.097001 |  Yeah, understandably.
[8821.48 - 8824.48] P:1955.80 E:0.096959 |  The great thing is, everyone's still on the pitch.
[8824.48 - 8828.48] P:1855.20 E:0.081430 |  They're not set off yet, so that's been managed to some degree as well.
[8828.48 - 8831.48] P:1853.86 E:0.068969 |  But, to be honest, I've watched that now.
[8831.48 - 8834.48] P:1774.59 E:0.084074 |  And see if you can do it by replays,
[8834.48 - 8837.48] P:1835.70 E:0.091348 |  and actually boot natural immediately for that.
[8837.48 - 8839.48] P:2004.08 E:0.092689 |  Because he's basically cheated.
[8839.48 - 8842.48] P:1978.09 E:0.107744 |  He's deliberately slowed down, thrown himself in the way of Fouker,
[8842.48 - 8845.48] P:1931.76 E:0.099594 |  then lain down in the ground as if he's badly injured.
[8845.48 - 8847.48] P:1952.79 E:0.064116 |  It's an absolute nonsense.
[8847.48 - 8850.48] P:1900.41 E:0.091423 |  Well, he went down from Vertz, who was running behind him.
[8850.48 - 8852.48] P:1664.47 E:0.085634 |  Vertz, who actually wasn't Fouker.
[8852.48 - 8857.48] P:1744.87 E:0.078300 |  He's on a yellow card as well, so had Anthony Taylor take an action,
[8857.48 - 8859.48] P:1768.02 E:0.092695 |  he would have been off.
[8859.48 - 8862.48] P:1819.22 E:0.098868 |  It is surprising, isn't it? 13 yellows, and we haven't had the red.
[8862.48 - 8866.48] P:1822.81 E:0.095324 |  Exactly, and I'm really happy Anthony Taylor didn't panic there and do that.
[8866.48 - 8869.48] P:1821.40 E:0.089508 |  And, by the way, he's out again, natural.
[8869.48 - 8871.48] P:1910.81 E:0.097583 |  Four minutes remain in extra time.
[8871.48 - 8874.48] P:1838.98 E:0.105319 |  Otherwise, we've got the drama of a penalty shootout.
[8874.48 - 8876.48] P:1805.62 E:0.104727 |  1-1, Kimmich's forward ball.
[8876.48 - 8878.48] P:1835.39 E:0.097400 |  Good save by Oeno Simon.
[8878.48 - 8881.48] P:1896.08 E:0.106777 |  Fouker did ever so well to get something on it.
[8881.48 - 8885.48] P:1944.43 E:0.095048 |  He's forward, and Oeno Simon away to his right, made the save.
[8885.48 - 8889.48] P:1909.79 E:0.094722 |  There's so little space for Fouker, but he always seems to get in front,
[8889.48 - 8892.48] P:1784.08 E:0.105354 |  and he gets a little neck there, a brilliant little header.
[8892.48 - 8894.48] P:1978.23 E:0.106566 |  Not quite enough per on it there,
[8894.48 - 8896.48] P:2027.36 E:0.108437 |  but he's had two great opportunities that's given.
[8896.48 - 8900.48] P:2035.59 E:0.101230 |  Once he's at the post, same thing, goalkeeper's been equal to it.
[8900.48 - 8904.48] P:1812.26 E:0.104903 |  Now, Natcio has gone down onto his haunches in that challenge with Fouker.
[8904.48 - 8907.48] P:1874.16 E:0.106209 |  Simon was instructed by his coach, Luis Delafuente,
[8907.48 - 8909.48] P:1912.16 E:0.087900 |  to put the ball out of play.
[8909.48 - 8912.48] P:1885.23 E:0.093579 |  He's back down on his haunches again, is that his Natcio.
[8912.48 - 8915.48] P:1871.12 E:0.090437 |  But the Germans aren't happy, they think this is time-wasting.
[8915.48 - 8918.48] P:1766.00 E:0.093869 |  Well, it was wasting everybody's time when it went down before.
[8918.48 - 8920.48] P:1671.27 E:0.092821 |  They're just not sure about it, that's the only holding,
[8920.48 - 8924.48] P:1821.79 E:0.080767 |  an odd possession, as if he's pulled something in his thigh,
[8924.48 - 8926.48] P:1881.69 E:0.086635 |  or just above his knee.
[8926.48 - 8930.48] P:1843.32 E:0.078656 |  No choice, mate, you either go off the pitch or you carry on.
[8930.48 - 8934.48] P:1792.60 E:0.101783 |  Is it worth remembering that statistic of Spain never beating a host nation
[8934.48 - 8937.48] P:1857.87 E:0.098427 |  in a major tournament, and in each of their last three,
[8937.48 - 8940.48] P:1860.01 E:0.096730 |  they've been drawn and they've been eliminated on penalties.
[8940.48 - 8943.48] P:1769.96 E:0.103267 |  Russia in the last 16 in 2018 World Cup,
[8943.48 - 8946.48] P:1771.63 E:0.102563 |  South Korea in the World Cup in 2002,
[8946.48 - 8952.48] P:1823.10 E:0.095024 |  and who, in England at least, will ever forget England at Euro 96,
[8952.48 - 8959.48] P:1989.32 E:0.100912 |  the quarter-finals, even for those who have 11% of English heritage,
[8959.48 - 8962.48] P:1973.87 E:0.102728 |  as the ball is cleared away downfield by Simon,
[8962.48 - 8965.48] P:1839.31 E:0.076576 |  but we're 1-1 and we're edging ever closer,
[8965.48 - 8969.48] P:1973.51 E:0.090924 |  and it goes through towards Neuer in Germany,
[8969.48 - 8972.48] P:1941.55 E:0.102421 |  who've won all six penalty shootouts at the major tournament
[8972.48 - 8978.48] P:1835.26 E:0.079199 |  since losing to that Ponenka chip in the Euro final of 1976,
[8978.48 - 8981.48] P:1845.26 E:0.075121 |  as the host nation.
[8981.48 - 8984.48] P:1830.85 E:0.089803 |  As we get close down, you mentioned Ponenka.
[8984.48 - 8988.48] P:1790.23 E:0.093169 |  Is anyone going to be brave enough on a shootout?
[8988.48 - 8991.48] P:1721.13 E:0.071513 |  I think I know, I think somebody will.
[8991.48 - 8994.48] P:1703.56 E:0.086631 |  I've got a fair idea who it will be.
[8994.48 - 8997.48] P:1909.48 E:0.083308 |  I think it's going to be David Deyvult, your hunch.
[8997.48 - 9000.48] P:1977.86 E:0.097921 |  Carvajal.
[9000.48 - 9002.48] P:1810.92 E:0.111012 |  He's just got that about.
[9002.48 - 9004.48] P:1919.36 E:0.086355 |  Really nice, he's one of them.
[9004.48 - 9006.48] P:1952.64 E:0.084235 |  Hey, if...
[9006.48 - 9008.48] P:1709.21 E:0.107567 |  I certainly think if Habers had been on the pitch,
[9008.48 - 9010.48] P:1781.35 E:0.092357 |  he might have been tempted by it too,
[9010.48 - 9012.48] P:1796.08 E:0.087872 |  because he's got that sort of bravery.
[9012.48 - 9015.48] P:1799.39 E:0.090519 |  Carvajal, who scored the decisive penalty when Spain
[9015.48 - 9019.48] P:1853.26 E:0.073654 |  won the Nations League against Croatia,
[9019.48 - 9022.48] P:1860.94 E:0.113673 |  is on the ball here now on this near side, the right.
[9022.48 - 9024.48] P:1894.17 E:0.094605 |  111, 5 live, and BBC sounds.
[9024.48 - 9026.48] P:1873.74 E:0.087610 |  We've got 60 seconds remaining.
[9026.48 - 9028.48] P:1917.63 E:0.088956 |  Kukere, passes the ball out wide.
[9028.48 - 9030.48] P:1945.81 E:0.100175 |  Cross comes in from the left.
[9030.48 - 9032.48] P:1877.15 E:0.103052 |  Moreno with the header!
[9032.48 - 9038.48] P:1843.44 E:0.106806 |  Moreno inside the six-shot area with the knockout blow, surely.
[9038.48 - 9041.48] P:1843.76 E:0.104149 |  And Spain finally would have banished
[9041.48 - 9044.48] P:1767.52 E:0.099615 |  the Houda against the host nation.
[9044.48 - 9049.48] P:1643.85 E:0.104012 |  Right at the end, they lead by two goals to one.
[9049.48 - 9051.48] P:1663.86 E:0.111923 |  Miquel Moreno!
[9051.48 - 9053.48] P:1604.58 E:0.088044 |  What a header!
[9053.48 - 9055.48] P:1715.18 E:0.097681 |  We just didn't see it coming,
[9055.48 - 9058.48] P:1676.64 E:0.099226 |  because both teams looked like they had nothing left.
[9058.48 - 9061.48] P:1581.99 E:0.109559 |  They were just beginning to play out the end of the game.
[9061.48 - 9063.48] P:1559.80 E:0.103459 |  But they get the ball on the left-hand side there.
[9063.48 - 9066.48] P:1612.43 E:0.096609 |  Kimmich does not get close enough,
[9066.48 - 9069.48] P:1628.83 E:0.097439 |  and he managed to get that ball into the centre there.
[9069.48 - 9071.48] P:1723.27 E:0.109218 |  But the amount of time that he's got,
[9071.48 - 9073.48] P:1614.84 E:0.103244 |  there is nobody within yards of him.
[9073.48 - 9076.48] P:1648.02 E:0.094567 |  Rudiger, who's probably the best defender,
[9076.48 - 9078.48] P:1671.08 E:0.100074 |  marker that you've got in this championship,
[9078.48 - 9080.48] P:1786.25 E:0.098345 |  absolutely nowhere near him.
[9080.48 - 9083.48] P:1708.86 E:0.108780 |  That may well be partly due to a little injury,
[9083.48 - 9088.48] P:1743.94 E:0.086155 |  but the ball was put in, and he had acres of space.
[9088.48 - 9091.48] P:1781.61 E:0.091204 |  Beautiful little head there into the back corner,
[9091.48 - 9095.48] P:1798.56 E:0.078254 |  and, well, they can't see him coming back from that, can you?
[9095.48 - 9098.48] P:1821.54 E:0.087800 |  He climbed high. He's up a body twisted.
[9098.48 - 9101.48] P:1905.87 E:0.099533 |  He directed it to the right of Manuel Noyer,
[9101.48 - 9105.48] P:1862.47 E:0.093371 |  and with three minutes of added-on time in extra time.
[9105.48 - 9109.48] P:1864.30 E:0.077715 |  Spain might finally at the tenth attempt
[9109.48 - 9113.48] P:1826.13 E:0.082331 |  have beaten the host nation at a major tournament.
[9113.48 - 9116.48] P:1750.52 E:0.073392 |  Meanwhile, somebody, I think,
[9116.48 - 9119.48] P:1544.21 E:0.108487 |  there's something going on behind the crowd,
[9119.48 - 9123.48] P:1508.03 E:0.088181 |  because Anthony Taylor has been...
[9125.48 - 9128.48] P:1928.05 E:0.093000 |  directed towards the Spanish bench,
[9128.48 - 9130.48] P:1938.88 E:0.086986 |  who's been shown a yellow card.
[9130.48 - 9132.48] P:1891.83 E:0.106121 |  Fabian has been shown a yellow card,
[9132.48 - 9134.48] P:1621.66 E:0.097396 |  celebrating as a substitute.
[9134.48 - 9136.48] P:1864.80 E:0.105885 |  So Fabian has been shown a yellow,
[9136.48 - 9139.48] P:1722.98 E:0.085768 |  but the Spanish bench aren't happy with something
[9139.48 - 9142.48] P:1846.35 E:0.075431 |  that has occurred behind,
[9142.48 - 9144.48] P:1889.17 E:0.104766 |  in that little section of support behind them.
[9144.48 - 9146.48] P:1683.04 E:0.102478 |  It's kind of weird, though, because that's it on players.
[9146.48 - 9150.48] P:1902.03 E:0.082410 |  I mean, I'm sure the Attebal doesn't give a stuff
[9150.48 - 9152.48] P:1807.46 E:0.083129 |  at that point in time.
[9152.48 - 9156.48] P:1772.26 E:0.093126 |  You know, you can maybe just have a complete another hero, just now.
[9157.48 - 9159.48] P:1839.28 E:0.103404 |  Play is back underway.
[9159.48 - 9162.48] P:1899.15 E:0.084291 |  Spain lead by two goals to one,
[9162.48 - 9164.48] P:1752.22 E:0.072641 |  and the crowd in Stuttgart,
[9164.48 - 9167.48] P:1826.76 E:0.086521 |  if you're not of Spanish persuasion, has been silenced.
[9167.48 - 9171.48] P:1866.77 E:0.089395 |  Hosselou back, heads it away, cleared by Ferran Torres.
[9171.48 - 9173.48] P:1929.48 E:0.093285 |  Three minutes of additional time.
[9173.48 - 9175.48] P:1825.39 E:0.101260 |  Three minutes, there's that.
[9175.48 - 9177.48] P:1805.95 E:0.099850 |  The madness that was going on, you couldn't tell.
[9177.48 - 9179.48] P:1578.34 E:0.117358 |  At some point, you wouldn't be surprised now
[9179.48 - 9181.48] P:1676.26 E:0.100924 |  if they go and just lob one into the middle
[9181.48 - 9183.48] P:1776.78 E:0.099791 |  and get another half chance to the Germans now.
[9183.48 - 9185.48] P:1776.88 E:0.087077 |  Must be a temptation if they got a corner kick
[9185.48 - 9187.48] P:1712.74 E:0.079466 |  for Noyer to come up as well.
[9187.48 - 9189.48] P:1724.50 E:0.094119 |  Dela Fuente is having to marshal his own substitutes,
[9189.48 - 9191.48] P:1837.47 E:0.092165 |  telling them to get back, ball forward,
[9191.48 - 9193.48] P:1891.35 E:0.108917 |  up towards Mussiala, prods it, edge of the area,
[9193.48 - 9196.48] P:1843.48 E:0.101617 |  Kimmig with a shot, blocked by the legs of La Porte,
[9196.48 - 9198.48] P:1864.25 E:0.103872 |  still inside the penalty area, hook goalwards,
[9198.48 - 9201.48] P:1920.27 E:0.091748 |  headed away, and then hook clear by Oya Saval.
[9201.48 - 9204.48] P:1948.89 E:0.103014 |  Still made with a drama, isn't over here on five live,
[9204.48 - 9205.48] P:1979.69 E:0.080219 |  and BBC sounds.
[9205.48 - 9208.48] P:1924.18 E:0.104943 |  Spain lead by two goals to one, now they can counterattack.
[9208.48 - 9210.48] P:1883.92 E:0.096831 |  Ferran Torres is away.
[9210.48 - 9213.48] P:1815.92 E:0.100566 |  Torres into the penalty area, Torres to finish it,
[9213.48 - 9216.48] P:1903.35 E:0.094419 |  he's put it wide, didn't even back go wide.
[9216.48 - 9220.48] P:1976.53 E:0.098417 |  They were ready to celebrate, they were all off the bench, down below.
[9220.48 - 9223.48] P:1906.00 E:0.107084 |  It's absolutely mayhem now, you've got to get up centre-forward now.
[9223.48 - 9227.48] P:1862.36 E:0.098034 |  They have just got to go for the Hill Mary Bowl.
[9227.48 - 9229.48] P:1944.91 E:0.093174 |  They've done it before, they've done it with Full Crook
[9229.48 - 9232.48] P:1930.73 E:0.102966 |  already in this competition, they need to put one in there.
[9232.48 - 9236.48] P:1926.18 E:0.093916 |  Ball goes long, Full Crook is up there, edge of the area,
[9236.48 - 9243.48] P:1924.89 E:0.085457 |  Oya Saval clatters it away, by my watch we're inside the last 40 seconds,
[9243.48 - 9245.48] P:1923.32 E:0.094413 |  almost collected it far side the left.
[9245.48 - 9248.48] P:2038.03 E:0.098895 |  He'll surely keep hold of the ball, he runs into the penalty area
[9248.48 - 9251.48] P:2032.87 E:0.103371 |  and he goes straight towards Noya, why didn't he go to the corner flag?
[9251.48 - 9257.48] P:1923.81 E:0.097407 |  I can tell you why, it's because he's pulled his hamstring, it can't run.
[9257.48 - 9261.48] P:1942.85 E:0.086765 |  Germany meanwhile attack, Wirtz far side the right,
[9261.48 - 9263.48] P:1925.37 E:0.097593 |  looking for a dramatic equaliser.
[9263.48 - 9268.48] P:1992.77 E:0.085590 |  Wirtz, who took us into extra time in the 89th minute to make it 1-1.
[9268.48 - 9270.48] P:1953.92 E:0.091964 |  Germany pass the ball out towards the right,
[9270.48 - 9274.48] P:1856.27 E:0.100584 |  Cross comes in, Full Crook with a header, planting wide, that was the moment.
[9274.48 - 9276.48] P:1755.05 E:0.100940 |  That was that, I thought if we'd get a chance,
[9276.48 - 9279.48] P:1830.08 E:0.090935 |  I was absolutely convinced we'd get a chance, that is a good chance.
[9279.48 - 9283.48] P:1881.48 E:0.095950 |  Now he's in front of the goal, but Full Crook is as good as anyone there.
[9283.48 - 9286.48] P:1836.75 E:0.100736 |  And the referee is walking up towards goalkeeper, what's he doing?
[9286.48 - 9289.48] P:1958.15 E:0.107258 |  I mean, there's three Spanish players down there claiming cramp,
[9289.48 - 9292.48] P:1979.96 E:0.104912 |  referees ignoring them as much as they possibly can,
[9292.48 - 9295.48] P:1916.29 E:0.101022 |  I think he should ignore them completely.
[9295.48 - 9300.48] P:1907.27 E:0.085667 |  The Spanish bench down below are ready to celebrate to a man.
[9300.48 - 9303.48] P:1795.74 E:0.090873 |  Every single one of them down there in that technical area,
[9304.48 - 9308.48] P:1921.05 E:0.089256 |  aligning up willing referee Anthony Taylor to blow his whistle.
[9308.48 - 9311.48] P:1924.71 E:0.092542 |  However, Danny Olmo has made it to the edge of the centre circle
[9311.48 - 9315.48] P:1925.73 E:0.094844 |  and he's still gone down with cramp, so there is a further delay.
[9315.48 - 9318.48] P:1959.18 E:0.083615 |  By my watch, we're now into the fourth minute.
[9318.48 - 9324.48] P:1840.32 E:0.080540 |  We had a minimum of three, Marata embraces an official down below.
[9324.48 - 9328.48] P:1972.83 E:0.094144 |  They're ready to celebrate, Ars Fane, they're leading by two goals to one.
[9328.48 - 9333.48] P:1967.52 E:0.072475 |  Una Simon goes long, gets plenty of distance,
[9333.48 - 9337.48] P:1929.71 E:0.097764 |  Andric wins the challenge, free kick to Svane, that's not Germany wanted.
[9337.48 - 9340.48] P:1978.95 E:0.101286 |  It's the Spanish supporters who celebrate, that surely is it.
[9340.48 - 9343.48] P:1769.61 E:0.094838 |  That's a big, big call there from the referee,
[9343.48 - 9345.48] P:1777.53 E:0.093380 |  because it doesn't seem to be a huge amount in that.
[9345.48 - 9348.48] P:1696.01 E:0.099925 |  Germany got the ball back again, they were going to launch another attack,
[9348.48 - 9350.48] P:1847.15 E:0.076504 |  but they're not going to get a chance to do that now.
[9350.48 - 9354.48] P:1755.45 E:0.093758 |  Spain are killing every single second, every time the ball goes out,
[9354.48 - 9357.48] P:1824.23 E:0.085804 |  somebody goes down, I'm not going to say Fane and Injury,
[9357.48 - 9360.48] P:1756.90 E:0.083130 |  but saying they've got cramps, saying there's something wrong,
[9360.48 - 9363.48] P:1788.39 E:0.078688 |  just trying to kill these last few seconds left.
[9363.48 - 9368.48] P:1949.40 E:0.102354 |  Miguel Moreno, he won the under-19 euros, the under-21 euros,
[9368.48 - 9376.48] P:1850.06 E:0.069524 |  under Luis Delafuente, and he's kept up his target of claiming a hat-trick,
[9376.48 - 9380.48] P:1909.13 E:0.090896 |  because Spain are moments away from a place in the semi-finals.
[9380.48 - 9385.48] P:1955.50 E:0.091728 |  They thought that was it, the substitutes are already running on the pitch to celebrate,
[9385.48 - 9388.48] P:1897.31 E:0.103965 |  and the fourth official has said get back off the field,
[9388.48 - 9390.48] P:2005.50 E:0.107228 |  because Germany have got one last chance.
[9390.48 - 9395.48] P:1929.71 E:0.108870 |  Mussi Ahrle, oh, Carvajal takes him down by the neck.
[9395.48 - 9401.48] P:1923.24 E:0.097875 |  Carvajal's already been booked, Carvajal will be sent off here,
[9401.48 - 9404.48] P:1890.66 E:0.105590 |  and there is the red from Anthony Taylor.
[9404.48 - 9410.48] P:1934.26 E:0.087753 |  Carvajal with a desperate bit of action, there's a shred from Carvajal.
[9410.48 - 9413.48] P:1746.03 E:0.108391 |  As one of those moments, he knows he's never getting back,
[9413.48 - 9417.48] P:1830.79 E:0.088822 |  he's done it before, and as he's done it, I think he's realised,
[9417.48 - 9419.48] P:1849.04 E:0.085386 |  I've blown it now, I'm going off.
[9419.48 - 9424.48] P:1781.82 E:0.092748 |  Has he taken one for the team? Has he just not got any energy?
[9424.48 - 9428.48] P:1921.79 E:0.088084 |  He threw himself, definitely needs to go off, great thing to do,
[9428.48 - 9432.48] P:1896.34 E:0.096256 |  and Germany have yet another last chance.
[9432.48 - 9436.48] P:1954.09 E:0.106937 |  A second yellow card, the first had ruled him out of the semi-final anyway.
[9436.48 - 9440.48] P:1961.84 E:0.090096 |  Carvajal was left with no choice, he trudges off,
[9440.48 - 9443.48] P:1972.11 E:0.095203 |  Spain are down to ten, late drama.
[9443.48 - 9446.48] P:1916.09 E:0.079832 |  He doesn't try Joff, he's still not off the pitch yet.
[9446.48 - 9449.48] P:1992.61 E:0.094946 |  The fourth official says please leave the field of play,
[9449.48 - 9453.48] P:1928.75 E:0.092062 |  but this free kick now for Germany, it's now or never.
[9453.48 - 9456.48] P:1946.28 E:0.086754 |  We had three minutes, a minimum of added on time.
[9456.48 - 9458.48] P:1864.76 E:0.097677 |  No, he has up.
[9458.48 - 9461.48] P:1930.73 E:0.096803 |  We're now into the seventh, in it comes, claimed by Simon,
[9461.48 - 9465.48] P:1830.38 E:0.101971 |  and he stays down, and the referee, Anthony Taylor,
[9465.48 - 9467.48] P:1824.00 E:0.104624 |  blows the full-time whistle,
[9467.48 - 9471.48] P:1806.66 E:0.095975 |  and Germany, the host nation, are out.
[9471.48 - 9475.48] P:1779.52 E:0.112161 |  The first host nation to be ever eliminated at the quarter-final stage,
[9475.48 - 9480.48] P:1744.49 E:0.098306 |  and Spain progress by two goals to one after extra time.
[9480.48 - 9483.48] P:1820.87 E:0.112055 |  I mean, extra revenue, and so much was happening at the end,
[9483.48 - 9485.48] P:1557.22 E:0.102921 |  so many exhausted players.
[9485.48 - 9487.48] P:1553.81 E:0.111062 |  I don't know who does have to win that game,
[9487.48 - 9489.48] P:1607.13 E:0.116648 |  it was really, really tight.
[9489.48 - 9491.48] P:1725.83 E:0.104909 |  I don't think they could have managed penalty kicks in,
[9491.48 - 9493.48] P:1662.76 E:0.107623 |  they were so exhausted.
[9493.48 - 9495.48] P:1642.37 E:0.103920 |  The one-group of players, the two-groups of players,
[9495.48 - 9497.48] P:1651.58 E:0.110931 |  they'll be very, very happy with this game,
[9497.48 - 9499.48] P:1604.92 E:0.103317 |  as the ones that are following this one,
[9499.48 - 9501.48] P:1731.72 E:0.098956 |  because there are so many exhausted players,
[9501.48 - 9503.48] P:1604.23 E:0.108778 |  there's so many injured players,
[9503.48 - 9505.48] P:1666.54 E:0.102916 |  there are going to be so many suspended players
[9505.48 - 9507.48] P:1610.92 E:0.098772 |  from these two teams there.
[9507.48 - 9510.48] P:1669.83 E:0.104585 |  But Spain have managed, by who could by group,
[9510.48 - 9512.48] P:1802.74 E:0.089700 |  to get through, and Germany, afterwards,
[9512.48 - 9515.48] P:1721.83 E:0.107486 |  been a very good competition for them, are going out,
[9515.48 - 9517.48] P:1769.84 E:0.096014 |  and I do feel sorry for them,
[9517.48 - 9519.48] P:1948.03 E:0.112144 |  because they gave our right good go today.
[9519.48 - 9522.48] P:1903.59 E:0.109963 |  So, late drama with the sending off of Carvajal,
[9522.48 - 9527.48] P:1763.14 E:0.109314 |  and also with Moreno's winning goal in the 119th minute,
[9527.48 - 9530.48] P:1801.79 E:0.106493 |  as the Spanish supporters celebrate in Stuttgart,
[9530.48 - 9534.48] P:1836.94 E:0.104680 |  they've knocked out Germany by two goals to one.
[9534.48 - 9535.48] P:1686.03 E:0.076906 |  Kelly.
[9535.48 - 9538.48] P:1607.06 E:0.106062 |  Ian Dennis, Sam Patnevin in Stuttgart for that game.
[9538.48 - 9541.48] P:1708.21 E:0.106683 |  Pat, it was a slow burner, but when it caught fire,
[9541.48 - 9543.48] P:1490.88 E:0.073072 |  it really caught fire.
[9543.48 - 9546.48] P:1521.97 E:0.099261 |  It was incredible.
[9546.48 - 9549.48] P:1743.38 E:0.100700 |  And you had no idea where it was going to go at the end.
[9549.48 - 9552.48] P:1525.03 E:0.097797 |  You talk about tactics, and tactics and changes in the system,
[9552.48 - 9554.48] P:1583.90 E:0.101588 |  they all happened, and they were happening
[9554.48 - 9556.48] P:1573.44 E:0.093458 |  every 30 seconds in this game.
[9556.48 - 9558.48] P:1537.40 E:0.100341 |  But after a while, they became much more human than that.
[9558.48 - 9562.48] P:1728.24 E:0.097473 |  It just became who was going to be least exhausted at the end,
[9562.48 - 9564.48] P:1723.43 E:0.100418 |  who was going to switch off for that second,
[9564.48 - 9567.48] P:1699.08 E:0.092294 |  and in the end, it turned out to be the Germans.
[9567.48 - 9570.48] P:1583.40 E:0.096045 |  A simple ball into the middle from the left-hand side,
[9570.48 - 9573.48] P:1716.56 E:0.092764 |  header it in the air post, and, you know,
[9573.48 - 9575.48] P:1758.80 E:0.102658 |  I do feel sorry for the Germans,
[9575.48 - 9577.48] P:1819.80 E:0.100971 |  because they've been great hosts of this tournament.
[9577.48 - 9579.48] P:1799.31 E:0.103516 |  They have improved as it's come along.
[9579.48 - 9582.48] P:1679.81 E:0.109587 |  They were the better team, and looked at the end of that nine minutes,
[9582.48 - 9584.48] P:1750.49 E:0.096079 |  and they were just going to cruise ahead in this.
[9584.48 - 9586.48] P:1652.62 E:0.102531 |  But well done, Spain. They came back.
[9586.48 - 9588.48] P:1730.13 E:0.095589 |  They're not just a pretty team.
[9588.48 - 9590.48] P:1693.08 E:0.089423 |  They have got some amount of grit as well,
[9590.48 - 9592.48] P:1666.55 E:0.092735 |  and they showed it today.
[9592.48 - 9595.48] P:1647.51 E:0.106944 |  Problem is, they've got grit, but they've also got a whole bunch of players
[9595.48 - 9597.48] P:1745.45 E:0.092133 |  missing for the semifinals.
[9597.48 - 9602.48] P:1632.78 E:0.097136 |  They're going to find it very hard to get through whoever they meet
[9602.48 - 9604.48] P:1713.96 E:0.070710 |  when they get there.
[9604.48 - 9607.48] P:1680.67 E:0.105519 |  They have spent every last bit of energy on this victory
[9607.48 - 9610.48] P:1884.42 E:0.093589 |  against Germany in Stuttgart today,
[9610.48 - 9612.48] P:1663.75 E:0.108730 |  as have Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis.
[9612.48 - 9614.48] P:1661.66 E:0.092805 |  But, Deno, I hope you've got something in the tank,
[9614.48 - 9617.48] P:1881.59 E:0.094226 |  because you're off to Berlin for Turkey against Netherlands tomorrow.
[9617.48 - 9621.48] P:1803.75 E:0.063025 |  I will see you there, but for now, to both of you, thank you very much.
