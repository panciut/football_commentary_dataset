[0.00 - 7.48] P:2003.81 E:0.087525 |  begin one nil up after their victory and their away goal at the new Tottenham
[7.48 - 13.00] P:1962.61 E:0.097485 |  Hotspur Stadium last week and Ajax plan to reach their first
[13.00 - 20.00] P:2009.10 E:0.097370 |  Champions League final since 1996. Ajax tonight are wearing that famous pit
[20.00 - 26.16] P:1920.94 E:0.092727 |  with the white sleeves and white sides of the shirt and the broad red band
[26.16 - 30.94] P:1811.63 E:0.078870 |  vertically up the front and the back white numbers white shorts and white
[30.94 - 38.44] P:1780.49 E:0.075685 |  socks with red trim and their captain their captain this boy mountain
[38.44 - 43.92] P:1820.95 E:0.094317 |  Matthias Delict the 19 year old shaking hands with the experienced world
[43.92 - 47.76] P:1858.72 E:0.106958 |  cup winning captain that Tottenham having goal he's all in orange
[47.76 - 51.96] P:1849.06 E:0.093557 |  Hugo Larisse he's indicating that the the teams are going to switch around
[51.96 - 60.60] P:1809.20 E:0.086871 |  actually and it's actually a late change to the Ajax team. Neres must have a
[60.60 - 67.00] P:1905.81 E:0.078050 |  problem because it appears that Casper Dahlberg the the young Danish striker is
[67.00 - 71.40] P:1861.68 E:0.093233 |  out there on the field the number 25 he's very blonde hair long blonde hair
[71.40 - 77.72] P:1908.82 E:0.081652 |  here he is yeah next to the the center circle so a late change for Ajax and
[77.72 - 82.32] P:1881.51 E:0.093899 |  it's Neres David Neres who has not been able to come out clearly been injured in
[82.32 - 87.12] P:1867.85 E:0.094245 |  the warm-up so so I think he's on the bench at the weekend wasn't in what and
[87.12 - 91.48] P:1912.69 E:0.100566 |  he was an injured certainly an injury concerned came on as a sub in the
[91.48 - 95.36] P:1870.81 E:0.096211 |  cook for the weekend yeah there you go and no that's a massive blow because he
[95.36 - 101.76] P:1849.00 E:0.094132 |  has been a key player for Ajax in this competition got the important goal here
[101.76 - 107.44] P:1892.59 E:0.085242 |  against Juventus so I think we'll see Tadich come out to the left-hand side
[107.48 - 116.76] P:1908.86 E:0.083136 |  and Dahlberg centre forward by trade we'll go up top so it is Ajax against
[116.76 - 122.72] P:2054.96 E:0.101424 |  Tottenham Hotspur we're live here in the Jullhand-Kreuth arena on the south side
[122.72 - 128.16] P:2041.92 E:0.102314 |  of Amsterdam on a mild evening the roof is open we can see the blue sky above
[128.16 - 134.04] P:1959.03 E:0.098968 |  and Tottenham kickoff 90 minutes away from their first Champions League final
[134.16 - 139.44] P:1885.22 E:0.092812 |  but it's a tall order tonight to win through here and turn this tie around I
[139.44 - 143.24] P:1839.64 E:0.104557 |  hope you enjoyed the drama last night I hope you're listening to Five Live and
[143.24 - 146.68] P:1841.46 E:0.095370 |  Ian Dennis and Alan Shearer with the commentary I can't promise that we'll
[146.68 - 151.56] P:1803.12 E:0.093429 |  be able to provide anything quite as dramatic as that but this Champions
[151.56 - 156.36] P:1880.95 E:0.092282 |  League very very rarely fails to deliver at this stage of the competition and so
[156.36 - 160.32] P:1843.19 E:0.090074 |  Ajax who are playing from right to left in the first half against Tottenham who
[160.36 - 165.28] P:1836.24 E:0.086154 |  are wearing their two-tone green the jade green and the dark green sleeves and
[165.28 - 169.52] P:1808.67 E:0.090852 |  shoulders and Ajax with the ball inside their own half so Ajax now having made
[169.52 - 172.88] P:1718.46 E:0.085631 |  that change yep you're right Chris Dahlberg playing through the middle and
[172.88 - 176.28] P:1783.86 E:0.095091 |  Tadich on the left-hand side they have an Anna in goal who's got the ball at his
[176.28 - 181.28] P:1860.24 E:0.099738 |  feet now clearing the ball away as Lucas Moura tried to close him down and it is
[181.28 - 187.20] P:1971.04 E:0.099529 |  out of play on the halfway line Tadich just leaned into by Trippia it is only
[187.28 - 192.96] P:1858.95 E:0.089704 |  a throw in says the referee who's the German Felix Brich so the Ajax team
[192.96 - 200.12] P:1817.38 E:0.089945 |  on Anna in goal a back four of Mas Raui, Delict, Blint and Talia Fico in midfield
[200.12 - 203.92] P:1792.33 E:0.095063 |  Schoenach, Van der Beek and De Jong van der Beek who scored the only goal of the
[203.92 - 209.68] P:1812.62 E:0.090242 |  tie so far and then Ziak on the right Tadich on the left now the top scorer
[209.68 - 215.72] P:1719.41 E:0.090088 |  this season and Dahlberg through the middle and Anna with the ball at his
[215.76 - 219.96] P:1852.18 E:0.091733 |  feet again left-footed curls a long pass out but Sissoko shields that and it's out
[219.96 - 223.96] P:1831.00 E:0.091828 |  of play for another throw and Tottenham tonight, Loris, Trippia, Aldervirel
[223.96 - 229.48] P:1807.48 E:0.091149 |  for Tongan and Rose, Wanyama and Sissoko, Ericsson, Ali, Lucas Moura and Son
[229.48 - 234.80] P:1881.75 E:0.092394 |  Sissoko swinging a high pass from right down below us out to the far side to
[234.80 - 238.64] P:1898.02 E:0.087311 |  Danny Rose and Son who is on the left-hand side just for the time being
[238.64 - 242.64] P:1913.36 E:0.088402 |  Son takes possession and knocks it back into his own half and we've got the two
[242.68 - 248.36] P:1942.58 E:0.089847 |  former Ajax central defenders for Tongan and Aldervirel, Jan for Tongan who's
[248.36 - 253.80] P:1818.79 E:0.086491 |  wearing a per-specs mask on his face didn't play at the weekend, Mauricio
[253.80 - 257.68] P:1892.60 E:0.088620 |  Pocciettino said yesterday he's fine there's no problem with his his
[257.68 - 263.00] P:1715.54 E:0.078082 |  well-being he said it's not an issue but he is wearing that per-specs mask as the
[263.00 - 267.48] P:1670.93 E:0.093687 |  ball is played back to daily Blint, Blint onto his left foot curls the pass
[267.48 - 272.52] P:1743.65 E:0.093875 |  here to the left-hand side where the left back the Argentine Talia Fico finds
[272.56 - 277.28] P:1800.66 E:0.084015 |  Taditch, Taditch is away from Trippia back onto his right foot but the former
[277.28 - 281.16] P:1751.16 E:0.087353 |  Southampton man on his left foot again and then uses his right to poke it
[281.16 - 287.72] P:1690.84 E:0.073788 |  forward for Vanderbake and Vanderbake turns near the corner flag now plays it
[287.72 - 292.28] P:1869.03 E:0.087178 |  in field a stretch from Taditch that takes it back to De Jong and now he is
[292.28 - 297.04] P:1804.24 E:0.098132 |  Schöner, Schöner square from him and the ball is lifted into the penalty area
[297.04 - 300.28] P:1901.98 E:0.089962 |  and Chester down by Dahlberg but he couldn't get the ball under control it's
[300.32 - 303.60] P:1855.09 E:0.105423 |  clear to where it rattles around then a shot on the edge of the penalty area from
[303.60 - 308.08] P:1819.55 E:0.104070 |  Ziak which is blocked on the edge of the box and now Tottenham Bragg Lucas Moura
[308.08 - 313.20] P:1878.08 E:0.100701 |  receives it from Dali Ali but delict leans into him and wins the ball back for
[313.20 - 318.16] P:1935.92 E:0.097257 |  Ajax, Chris Sutton. Yeah and he should have fed Song Moura as a chance, Song on the
[318.16 - 323.40] P:1967.68 E:0.105980 |  left-hand side on the overlap didn't feed the ball through as a chance for Ajax I
[323.40 - 327.16] P:1993.10 E:0.098278 |  just wondered whether there was an offside in there. Ziak now to Taditch edge of the
[327.20 - 334.24] P:1964.57 E:0.101222 |  penalty area shoots and a save by Lloris full length left hand to it and that is a
[334.24 - 338.80] P:1926.57 E:0.097520 |  top save from the Tottenham goalkeeper to push it round the post. Yeah as Taditch
[338.80 - 344.04] P:1840.52 E:0.100279 |  off the left-hand side I think it takes a deflection off Kiran Trippi as left
[344.04 - 349.84] P:1775.11 E:0.102751 |  ankle and Lloris is a big left hand to get it round the post. You feel Lloris is
[349.84 - 355.44] P:1784.94 E:0.090768 |  gonna have to have a big night for Spurs. Well that will make him feel good
[355.72 - 360.08] P:1816.13 E:0.091731 |  Clearly there have been questions about his form this season got a good sight of it
[360.08 - 365.64] P:1706.78 E:0.081946 |  perhaps the deflection helped him but a good save nevertheless. Corner then for
[365.64 - 369.72] P:1840.94 E:0.088820 |  Ajax this is the first of the match it's nil nil very early stages here on BBC
[369.72 - 376.64] P:1901.84 E:0.105607 |  Radio 5 Live. The out swinging corner, delict with a header! Scores! Ajax are in front
[376.64 - 384.08] P:1878.78 E:0.112627 |  only four minutes on the clock and it is the 19 year old captain towering above
[384.12 - 390.28] P:1831.59 E:0.104646 |  anyone else heading in from seven or eight yards it flew past Lloris that is
[390.28 - 396.32] P:1831.90 E:0.107616 |  the early goal that the Johan Cruyff arena wanted and there is an explosion of
[396.32 - 403.24] P:1791.50 E:0.099835 |  noise in here and this semi-final now has just become all the harder for
[403.24 - 411.16] P:1801.94 E:0.109770 |  Tottenham. One nil Ajax, two nil on aggregate. It's a poor from Tottenham's point of view but this young man is going
[411.32 - 418.88] P:1910.29 E:0.089180 |  to play for the first time in a row. He's in the first place as delict lights up the arena it's the perfect start from Ajax. I think he runs off
[418.88 - 426.40] P:1876.68 E:0.096316 |  Trippier is just checking this the referee Spurs players surrounding the referee asking for a foul I didn't think it was but it's a
[426.40 - 433.80] P:1872.41 E:0.099202 |  towering header no one on the post for Spurs and Spurs are really gonna have to do this the hard way.
[434.16 - 442.32] P:1856.59 E:0.094237 |  So Trippier marking delict and Delhi Ali was centrally on the six yard line but
[442.32 - 448.96] P:1905.91 E:0.093857 |  he lost and he did lost Trippier. I think Trippier is there as a blocker gone half zone all that but
[448.96 - 453.72] P:1885.82 E:0.093170 |  Ali didn't attack the ball but as soon as he got the run delict unstoppable
[453.72 - 463.12] P:1760.54 E:0.086150 |  clinical header. So one nil we've now played five and a half minutes and
[463.16 - 470.24] P:1803.57 E:0.104665 |  Matthias delict it's his seventh goal of the season remember he scored the crucial goal the winner away against Juventus
[470.24 - 474.08] P:1752.80 E:0.097952 |  here's Son on the left hand side Son now into the penalty area does well.
[474.08 - 482.12] P:1869.70 E:0.100118 |  Pliss and Cross hits the post. Paul scrambles inside the box. Ericsson on the stretch could only stab it into a defender on the edge of the six yard area and the
[482.12 - 488.32] P:1769.77 E:0.099240 |  post cleared. What a start to the game I think it was a cross from Son really good
[488.32 - 492.28] P:1787.49 E:0.103682 |  driving run down the left hand side went across the ball in and then let it go.
[492.28 - 500.20] P:1833.60 E:0.087924 |  Hit the post and somehow Ajax scrambled it to safety lacks goalkeeping though from
[500.20 - 506.56] P:1848.12 E:0.103958 |  an Anna. Certainly was he stepped off his lane at the near post and Son drove it low
[506.56 - 510.84] P:1949.53 E:0.099072 |  and he hit the foot of the post. Ericsson was in the box stretching for it but
[510.88 - 515.24] P:1878.20 E:0.090429 |  couldn't get any meaningful shot in on it and it was blocked on the edge of the
[515.24 - 520.80] P:1871.92 E:0.089011 |  area and so it is still Ajax one Tottenham nil but we've got to start here a
[520.80 - 524.80] P:1897.77 E:0.090431 |  little like the Etihad Stadium in the in the previous round for Tottenham.
[524.80 - 529.24] P:1944.49 E:0.089625 |  Spurs responded in the Etihad just watching again the corner and it is
[529.24 - 533.92] P:1785.44 E:0.091256 |  Trippier I have to say it's really poor from Trippier initially you know he's
[533.92 - 538.88] P:1772.12 E:0.090381 |  there as a blocker delict just shrugs him aside gets an easy run and powers
[538.92 - 544.12] P:1905.24 E:0.091815 |  over Ali and heads it home the perfect start for Ajax. Yeah deli Ali was
[544.12 - 550.20] P:1987.16 E:0.094063 |  effectively stationary as delict was making the run high above him or at
[550.20 - 554.32] P:1850.33 E:0.085234 |  least a head above him and that was enough for delict to head it what a good
[554.32 - 558.80] P:1820.66 E:0.091749 |  head or as well though central defender classic central defenders goal from a
[558.80 - 564.12] P:1781.98 E:0.100324 |  set piece. Well he's a powerhouse who can play but really disappointed from
[564.12 - 568.24] P:1849.32 E:0.096435 |  Trippier you know he's been assigned to do a job there make sure you get a block on
[568.28 - 572.88] P:1825.98 E:0.096910 |  don't make it easy I'm not saying Ali covered himself in glory as well but
[572.88 - 578.32] P:1738.37 E:0.082446 |  very difficult and the defender that powerful gets a run and a jump on you.
[578.32 - 585.76] P:1859.80 E:0.083642 |  So two nil on aggregate Sasoko it's challenged he is fouled as that daily
[585.76 - 590.28] P:1924.84 E:0.093592 |  Blint comes in and captures Sasoko who's just stayed down rubbing his right
[590.28 - 595.92] P:1780.02 E:0.084880 |  knee right thigh. It's a bouncing ball I think that's a naughty challenge he's
[595.96 - 598.92] P:1782.97 E:0.069451 |  lucky to get away with that. Ali Blint.
[598.92 - 604.64] P:1912.03 E:0.083363 |  Studge up, studge up caught him on the side of the knee daily Blint free kick
[604.64 - 609.64] P:1898.31 E:0.082077 |  and nothing more than that could easily have been a yellow card. One nil Ajax
[609.64 - 613.80] P:1913.46 E:0.091796 |  lead free kick though Trippier to take this in curls it beyond the defensive
[613.80 - 618.24] P:1742.18 E:0.086174 |  line flick back in from the left hand side by deli Ali and cleared out into
[618.24 - 622.76] P:1800.15 E:0.084579 |  the full back position on the far side. Ericsson turns plays it back to Danny
[622.80 - 628.56] P:1934.73 E:0.090915 |  Rose. Rose then in field towards Sasoko with those distinctive white wrist
[628.56 - 634.60] P:2014.50 E:0.095512 |  bands on each wrist. Long to the right hand side to Trippier. Here's Lucas Moura.
[634.60 - 641.32] P:2133.66 E:0.104256 |  Lucas Moura plays the ball straight into Taditch and so Tottenham are back in
[641.32 - 644.64] P:2187.92 E:0.104619 |  possession closer to the halfway line Trippier going back into his own half
[644.64 - 652.68] P:2077.59 E:0.096654 |  and we see for the first time Eric Ten Haag the coach who has had this
[652.72 - 657.84] P:2008.73 E:0.102700 |  terrific season they're in the running for a treble and no one expected it.
[657.84 - 662.92] P:2001.11 E:0.091614 |  Their first match in this competition in the second qualifying round was played
[662.92 - 667.60] P:1970.03 E:0.083746 |  just ten days after the World Cup final. Here's Trippier many of these Tottenham
[667.60 - 672.00] P:2011.88 E:0.090156 |  players of course were only just back from the World Cup. Here is Wanyama
[672.00 - 677.08] P:2100.86 E:0.106485 |  plays it to the left hand side for Tongan and now Wanyama up towards Lucas Moura
[677.08 - 680.92] P:1940.85 E:0.100657 |  and he's leaned into by Blint and Tottenham come out with the ball. Lucas Moura
[680.96 - 684.52] P:1955.88 E:0.109003 |  now to Dali Ali 30 yards out taking it onto the edge of the D and that's a
[684.52 - 689.96] P:1918.44 E:0.087296 |  superb sliding interception and tackle. Guess who? From Frankie De Jong the
[689.96 - 694.96] P:1865.05 E:0.093432 |  Barcelona bound Frankie De Jong. Nipped it away beautifully but he has
[694.96 - 699.16] P:2005.94 E:0.099703 |  Ericsson now on his old stamping ground. Oh lovely reverse past it Dali Ali
[699.16 - 703.96] P:1952.93 E:0.091647 |  curling shot wide of the far post from the left side of the penalty area. I think
[703.96 - 709.88] P:1872.56 E:0.093799 |  the flag went up anyway but what a start to the game really open. Lovely reverse
[709.92 - 716.32] P:1769.04 E:0.085246 |  pass from Ericsson. We know he's capable and he is marginally very tight
[716.32 - 723.04] P:1823.74 E:0.081124 |  Dali Ali offside but off the mark as well it was a poor effort. So Ajax have
[723.04 - 727.84] P:1839.50 E:0.092446 |  continued their record of scoring in every match at home this season. They've
[727.84 - 732.84] P:1824.05 E:0.094578 |  only lost one in any competition here that was to Real Madrid in the last 16
[732.84 - 736.68] P:1712.23 E:0.099312 |  and of course they went and won so convincingly and so brilliantly in the
[736.72 - 742.76] P:1854.02 E:0.098317 |  Bernabal. That was their 166th goal of the season in all competitions. One
[742.76 - 746.96] P:1846.39 E:0.101266 |  Nile Ali here the ball is played by Vanderbake to the right hand side. Ziak
[746.96 - 750.28] P:1925.12 E:0.081791 |  on his left foot shoots but it took a double deflection bounces back to the
[750.28 - 754.32] P:1873.77 E:0.088723 |  red and white of Ajax. Blint is almost joining in the attack now here's
[754.32 - 757.88] P:1845.65 E:0.088893 |  Tali Fico to Ziak edge of the penalty area forced wide into the full back

[766.04 - 770.84] P:1927.38 E:0.097491 |  immediately on the counter attack. Danny Rose just cantering forward at the
[770.84 - 776.48] P:1935.42 E:0.089516 |  moment and then passing the ball to Son on the left wing. Son turns and takes on
[776.48 - 781.04] P:1959.16 E:0.096511 |  Delict who gets in the challenge. Huge tears such a favourite here this 19-year-old
[781.04 - 785.60] P:1879.97 E:0.087880 |  who played in the Europa League final two years ago against Manchester United
[785.60 - 791.44] P:1761.81 E:0.089856 |  remember as a 17-year-old he's the youngest man ever to have achieved 100
[791.48 - 797.64] P:1782.31 E:0.097038 |  appearances for the Ajax first team. Talked about leading by example he's a real

[833.08 - 840.76] P:1919.48 E:0.081274 |  goal to nil it's not serious serious yet but it is it was a tall order now it's a
[840.76 - 846.36] P:1800.23 E:0.089408 |  really tall order well I mean Spurs is clear what they have to do now but they
[846.40 - 852.92] P:1929.46 E:0.078864 |  have looked to threat in the early stages going forward however van der Beek
[852.92 - 856.60] P:1843.27 E:0.095796 |  now to Schoen back to van der Beek inside the penalty area now back to
[856.60 - 859.76] P:1835.00 E:0.086549 |  Schoen about Ericsson comes in with a challenge van der Beek still puts the
[859.76 - 863.80] P:1880.96 E:0.092677 |  challenge in on Cicoko but Ericsson was there to chip it away to the halfway
[863.80 - 870.56] P:1876.93 E:0.081710 |  line but across from right back comes Mas Raui and clears but Lucas Moura now
[870.56 - 874.48] P:1921.19 E:0.094731 |  running with intent at the Ajax defence but under pressure passes the ball
[874.84 - 881.80] P:1829.85 E:0.084878 |  beyond Delhi Ali and Mas Raui who is back out right back Mas Raui the Moroccan
[881.80 - 885.04] P:1796.93 E:0.091806 |  international one of the Moroccan internationals in the Ajax squad like

[889.52 - 894.20] P:1839.51 E:0.094242 |  injury which is why Veltman played in the first leg. He's a versatile player at Mas Raui
[896.20 - 901.72] P:1800.14 E:0.089844 |  playing midfield as well but all these Ajax players very very comfortable
[902.08 - 905.80] P:1815.52 E:0.098259 |  wherever they play. Ericsson lifting the ball into the area Lucas Moura just heads
[905.80 - 911.24] P:1902.77 E:0.096723 |  it on and the ball drops into the clubs of the Cameroon international goalkeeper
[911.24 - 918.04] P:1770.04 E:0.085554 |  Andre Onanak so Ajax leading by one goal to nil. I'm sure you can hear the
[918.04 - 923.00] P:1753.90 E:0.087155 |  brilliant atmosphere they have a massive absolutely massive red and white
[923.00 - 928.72] P:1763.87 E:0.083849 |  drum which is right in the middle of the end to our right and there are a number
[928.72 - 934.68] P:1799.43 E:0.085523 |  of Ajax supporters who are gathered around it with the taps off as they say
[934.68 - 940.24] P:1829.04 E:0.082558 |  in Glasgow as you'll know Chris as the ball goes back to Onanak out to the
[940.24 - 943.60] P:1936.06 E:0.092279 |  right-hand side Chris Sutton who once scored for Celtic here in this
[943.60 - 948.72] P:1831.56 E:0.082462 |  competition in this stadium here now is I suspect there'll be some taps off that
[948.72 - 952.92] P:1853.50 E:0.092801 |  night to celebrate it as well. Here's Zeeck Zeeck playing the ball forward now
[952.92 - 958.28] P:1894.58 E:0.090637 |  for the run through the middle by Dolberg drafted in late oh and then Zeeck catches
[958.32 - 962.92] P:1884.88 E:0.086294 |  Danny Rose he was late and sent Danny Rose sprawling I think he's okay three
[962.92 - 967.52] P:1820.08 E:0.084129 |  kicks off. Very clever from Danny Rose under pressure Zeeck behind him just
[967.52 - 974.04] P:1753.93 E:0.078918 |  let it run through his legs out on the left hand touch line but Zeeck at the
[974.04 - 978.44] P:1848.35 E:0.082868 |  World Cup was a bit of a disappointment has to be said and he's been a
[978.44 - 984.84] P:1748.52 E:0.081225 |  revelation right foot left foot good shot on him. Ball played up from the back by
[984.84 - 988.08] P:1846.85 E:0.093970 |  Aldervayrock headed on by Lucas Moura deli-ali the ball bounces down
[988.12 - 994.04] P:1886.48 E:0.099112 |  delict is there delict wins it back from deli-ali stronger just looked like a
[994.04 - 998.00] P:1902.61 E:0.091080 |  greater hunger there and he took the ball away and Ajax are back in possession
[998.00 - 1001.84] P:1911.38 E:0.087202 |  inside their own half. Chris all of the European ties that you were involved in
[1001.84 - 1006.20] P:1845.45 E:0.077840 |  this sort of situation you know what what it taught them what is that what has
[1006.20 - 1011.44] P:1946.97 E:0.086826 |  their approach got to be now? Well I mean you know at the start the emphasis
[1011.44 - 1015.20] P:1899.87 E:0.099351 |  would have been on balance not conceding an early goal it's the worst
[1015.24 - 1021.44] P:1813.14 E:0.088347 |  possible start you know Spurs know they can't concede again but in the first
[1021.44 - 1024.08] P:1808.62 E:0.098093 |  leg they didn't really look a threat going forward they've looked at
[1024.08 - 1028.52] P:1802.18 E:0.094629 |  threatening these early stages they just have to be clinical whether it's the
[1028.52 - 1035.12] P:1772.90 E:0.091037 |  final pass or they get the opportunity there's still no rush from Spurs. BBC

[1048.92 - 1051.76] P:1868.32 E:0.089748 |  to his feet just putting his hand up to his mask I think he was just

[1076.28 - 1081.44] P:1851.01 E:0.088665 |  strongly there to the challenge that came in and referee Brick is actually
[1081.44 - 1087.48] P:1839.45 E:0.093685 |  reaching for his yellow card to Cisoco. Well do you know what referee let the
[1087.48 - 1093.76] P:1852.55 E:0.082324 |  earlier one go daily blend I think Cisoco feels he can get the ball he goes to
[1093.76 - 1097.84] P:1827.93 E:0.095605 |  ground and that's the issue now I think it's a yellow card but that shouldn't be
[1097.88 - 1103.80] P:1791.24 E:0.083842 |  the first one of this evening I think Maritjo Pochettino he's unhappy about
[1103.80 - 1110.16] P:1825.58 E:0.075163 |  that and quite rightly so he's all in black tonight Maritjo Pochettino looks
[1110.16 - 1114.08] P:1816.82 E:0.087722 |  a little bit like he could be in the Western that Matthias Delink might be in
[1114.08 - 1117.96] P:1799.72 E:0.075295 |  here's the ball down the left-hand side that's deflected out of play and it's a
[1117.96 - 1121.12] P:1775.46 E:0.095524 |  throwing to top them half inside their own half we've only seen the bad and the
[1121.16 - 1131.04] P:1818.36 E:0.081417 |  ugly of first so far defensively. Yep we had the spaghetti last night throwing
[1131.04 - 1136.04] P:1802.63 E:0.087310 |  from Trippia here's Lucas Moura, Lucas Moura rolls the ball to the left-hand side
[1136.04 - 1140.88] P:1774.42 E:0.088908 |  yep we watched that night of nights last night for Liverpool in an Italian
[1140.88 - 1146.56] P:1820.53 E:0.096531 |  restaurant with absolutely no one else. Son tries to take the ball through the
[1146.56 - 1153.64] P:1808.96 E:0.085209 |  middle Delik is able to take the ball away and now Ziak his pass hits Rose and
[1153.64 - 1158.48] P:1876.77 E:0.097041 |  then Ziak is able to turn it all the way back to Delik again on the edge of the
[1158.48 - 1166.00] P:1783.27 E:0.077916 |  penalty area. Ziak's almost in his own right back area little ball to De Jong
[1166.00 - 1172.48] P:1843.74 E:0.099511 |  and now Ziak and this is this is trademark Ajax this season they are
[1172.52 - 1178.20] P:1938.16 E:0.101471 |  passing the ball slickly and quickly out from the back and they're passing it
[1178.20 - 1182.20] P:1958.16 E:0.092420 |  around Tottenham and you can hear the reception to this as well from the
[1182.20 - 1187.80] P:1841.92 E:0.088166 |  Ajax supporters inside the stadium around us 55,000 or so. They cannot let
[1187.80 - 1193.00] P:1855.20 E:0.098236 |  De Jong dictate the players in Deli Alley's area he needs to be all over him
[1193.00 - 1198.44] P:1882.73 E:0.074530 |  Deli Alley don't let him get his head up everything goes through him.
[1198.48 - 1205.84] P:1853.30 E:0.073837 |  Wintery orchestrates the attacks. Chris for those listeners who might not have
[1205.84 - 1210.52] P:1868.79 E:0.081375 |  seen Frankie De Jong play you know Barcelona are spending something like
[1210.52 - 1216.52] P:1937.11 E:0.082841 |  75 million euros on him he's 21 he's 22 this week actually on Sunday tell
[1216.52 - 1220.48] P:1801.74 E:0.079436 |  everyone what it is about him that that makes him worth that money. Well in a
[1220.48 - 1226.52] P:1854.77 E:0.089705 |  city famous for their artists I mean he is an absolute artist he really is he
[1226.56 - 1232.84] P:1748.13 E:0.083950 |  glides through the game and is in possession. Vanderbake is flicking the
[1232.84 - 1237.48] P:1941.51 E:0.093481 |  ball to Ziak Ziak crafts a pass that's beyond Kadditch down the left and
[1237.48 - 1242.04] P:1936.50 E:0.077859 |  bounces beyond him and out of play throwing to Tottenham.
[1242.04 - 1250.16] P:1810.51 E:0.090839 |  I can't remember seeing two young players delict under De Jong who are this
[1250.20 - 1258.84] P:1859.21 E:0.077409 |  mature at this stage of their careers and they play like 32 year olds have a
[1258.84 - 1264.44] P:1822.68 E:0.081847 |  hundred caps they really do. Yes De Jong in midfield he's a bit more of a
[1264.44 - 1269.20] P:1830.14 E:0.083282 |  Rembrandt isn't he whereas delict at the back he's a little bit more Jackson
[1269.20 - 1274.60] P:1877.11 E:0.085919 |  Pollock throwing four Ajax on this side of the field up towards Dolberg
[1274.64 - 1281.56] P:1765.22 E:0.085185 |  bounces down and then it's just a little push from Dolberg and it's a
[1281.56 - 1284.80] P:1834.18 E:0.098841 |  free kick to Tottenham half way inside their own half almost 20 minutes played
[1284.80 - 1290.16] P:1814.44 E:0.088885 |  and that early-burly start to the match is just settled down now which I guess
[1290.16 - 1295.68] P:2054.00 E:0.095796 |  is good for Ajax as well with that goal. Well we know they have more goals and
[1295.68 - 1299.80] P:2132.88 E:0.102493 |  don't we I mean but credit to them because that change at the start and
[1299.84 - 1304.52] P:1900.48 E:0.086717 |  they're injured they've adapted very well Dolberg going centrally.
[1304.52 - 1307.84] P:1914.97 E:0.086624 |  Kadditch on the left-hand side keeping the ball
[1307.84 - 1313.28] P:1849.25 E:0.075478 |  van der Big actually turns and back heals it to Kadditch when he could actually
[1313.28 - 1317.44] P:1825.06 E:0.087098 |  have just passed it to him and now Talia Fico goes to ground very easily
[1317.44 - 1323.20] P:1894.13 E:0.087675 |  against the Solco in with a challenge second foul on Solco against Talia Fico
[1323.20 - 1326.12] P:1831.38 E:0.087437 |  and it's one Ajax a free kick on the left-hand side half way inside the
[1326.16 - 1331.04] P:1863.25 E:0.087405 |  Tottenham half. It's looking good for Ajax at the moment. 28 minutes on the clock
[1331.04 - 1339.20] P:1922.17 E:0.084147 |  Ajax one Tottenham nil. It's gonna have to be quite a comeback quite a Champions League
[1339.20 - 1344.32] P:1951.80 E:0.080607 |  fight back if we're going to see only the second final featuring two English
[1344.32 - 1349.96] P:1905.86 E:0.076899 |  clubs in the Champions League. Free kick chance for Ajax to make it even worse.
[1349.96 - 1354.80] P:1799.07 E:0.084930 |  Now Ziak plays it in and it's headed up and away by Fatongan did well actually
[1354.84 - 1358.84] P:1862.77 E:0.079418 |  for Fatongan running back into his six yard box and heading it away and Lukas
[1358.84 - 1362.80] P:1968.38 E:0.089789 |  Moura now for to Christian Eriksen. Christian Eriksen has two men on him
[1362.80 - 1365.88] P:1946.38 E:0.099210 |  manages to find the pass to Song who's come all the way across to the right-hand side
[1365.88 - 1372.76] P:1887.93 E:0.099320 |  but he has the ball nipped away from him by Mas Raui and they're at it again Ajax
[1372.76 - 1378.48] P:1791.57 E:0.081635 |  passing the ball from the back and then it goes back into central defence to the
[1378.52 - 1385.08] P:1852.41 E:0.101316 |  goal scorer Delict. So quick and slick with their transitions. Ajax was good
[1385.08 - 1393.84] P:1762.03 E:0.076776 |  defending from Mas Raui. This first broke out. Ajax four times European
[1393.84 - 1401.76] P:1781.55 E:0.092429 |  champions not since 1995 as Tottenham play the ball back into the centre
[1401.76 - 1408.48] P:1755.87 E:0.087627 |  circle. Tottenham trying to get to their first European final since the 1984
[1408.48 - 1416.48] P:1806.45 E:0.080424 |  UEFA Cup. Here's Cisoco in the centre circle Cisoco battles his way through two
[1416.48 - 1420.20] P:2073.67 E:0.091127 |  three challenges still going Cisoco plays it to Son on the right-hand side
[1420.20 - 1423.64] P:1967.53 E:0.091723 |  Son approaching the penalty area step over goes for the curling shot it's
[1423.64 - 1427.84] P:1807.62 E:0.094231 |  deflected right across the area but Rose couldn't get there and Mas Raui was
[1427.88 - 1432.76] P:1855.08 E:0.098024 |  able to step out and clear it away and then Zeeck is challenged he's found
[1432.76 - 1437.32] P:1968.34 E:0.102937 |  free kick to Tongan coming in for the challenge free kick to Ajax. Spurs hard
[1437.32 - 1441.80] P:1810.47 E:0.098306 |  done by there but that was a good positive driving run from the powerhouse
[1441.80 - 1448.52] P:1827.10 E:0.094880 |  Cisoco in the middle of the park for a few bodies popped the ball out wide and a
[1448.52 - 1455.68] P:1668.96 E:0.082366 |  shot from Son came to nothing. Ajax one nil up and Mauritio Pochettino has
[1455.72 - 1460.44] P:1749.10 E:0.085600 |  plenty to think about there on the touch line Spurs second semifinal of the
[1460.44 - 1465.16] P:1740.17 E:0.090187 |  season they've lost in semifinals in each of the last three seasons and two nil
[1465.16 - 1473.40] P:1781.11 E:0.082367 |  down on aggregate here are looking at another exit in the last four. Still
[1473.40 - 1477.04] P:1848.77 E:0.094025 |  three-quarters of the match to play though as the ball is passed forward by
[1477.04 - 1481.04] P:1876.98 E:0.091252 |  Talia Fico but Alderviral will get there and steer it back to Lloris on his left
[1481.04 - 1485.36] P:1895.52 E:0.094437 |  foot passes the ball out to Wanyama edge of the penalty area back it goes into the
[1485.40 - 1489.60] P:1862.45 E:0.096038 |  box to Tongan the whistles in the Gias are trying to put the jitters on Tottenham
[1489.60 - 1494.08] P:1826.65 E:0.090943 |  who are passing it out Ajax style Rose nice flick from Ericsson back to Rose
[1494.08 - 1497.60] P:1945.23 E:0.097368 |  who's over the halfway line Rose is then shoved over referee allows play to
[1497.60 - 1502.92] P:1918.54 E:0.102011 |  continue Deli Ali what a pass to Son Son stabs it goalwards I know Nana is able
[1502.92 - 1508.08] P:1845.74 E:0.097859 |  to drop down to his left and make that a routine save. I tell you what that was
[1508.08 - 1514.04] P:1687.17 E:0.096659 |  really good from Spurs Ericsson in his own half clever little flick to release
[1514.08 - 1520.96] P:1753.05 E:0.089762 |  Rose. Pop the ball into Deli Ali it's a really incisive ball son in between the
[1520.96 - 1526.60] P:1907.24 E:0.088656 |  two centre halves he just can't get the ball out of his feet enough. He prods the
[1526.60 - 1532.44] P:1817.46 E:0.087334 |  ball and Nana gets down to his left hand side half a chance for Spurs. More like it
[1532.44 - 1535.68] P:1843.50 E:0.102259 |  that's what they want that was good from Deli Ali as well and here he is Deli
[1535.68 - 1539.32] P:1943.24 E:0.106360 |  Ali Lucas Moura who's driving into the penalty area lays it back Ericsson with a
[1539.36 - 1545.32] P:1900.31 E:0.096726 |  shot straight at the Nana from an angle on his left foot he shot straight at the
[1545.32 - 1550.60] P:1835.23 E:0.096884 |  Ajax goalkeeper's chest. Well they have to be clinical at some stage Spurs and it
[1550.60 - 1556.48] P:1734.16 E:0.093533 |  was a really good driving run from Lucas Moura got in between the centre halves
[1556.48 - 1560.88] P:1759.70 E:0.090260 |  actually prods the ball back of it Ericsson you expect him from that range
[1560.88 - 1565.36] P:1904.39 E:0.090708 |  how many times what 16 yards out how many times have we seen the net bulge
[1565.80 - 1572.16] P:1766.28 E:0.077275 |  over the years two chances there for Tottenham now that gives Spurs fans two
[1572.16 - 1575.60] P:1828.10 E:0.102581 |  and a half thousand to serve them up in the corner of the Johan Cruyff arena on
[1575.60 - 1579.12] P:1869.49 E:0.086610 |  the far side a little bit of hope but you're right Chris they've got the take
[1579.12 - 1587.56] P:1784.18 E:0.090783 |  them they cannot afford to see chances come and go like that. Trippie a long
[1587.56 - 1591.12] P:1928.56 E:0.103736 |  and forward but that just drifts straight out of play and Ajax still lead by
[1591.16 - 1596.12] P:1816.96 E:0.081555 |  that goal in the fifth minute from Matthias Deliq from the corner. He can only
[1596.12 - 1603.16] P:1826.18 E:0.088025 |  describe that pass from Trippie as a shank and he is moving very awkwardly and
[1603.16 - 1609.24] P:1770.07 E:0.082333 |  holding his right groin I do believe he's had problems in that area before
[1609.24 - 1615.36] P:1735.79 E:0.077443 |  but he's had a very shaky start to the game. Yes he has caught out or at least
[1615.72 - 1621.32] P:1878.77 E:0.083135 |  Deliqt lost Trippie for the the only goal of the night so far so let's just
[1621.32 - 1628.80] P:1759.01 E:0.082930 |  keep an eye on Kieran Trippie. I suppose the question is is Deliqt why is Alder
[1628.80 - 1635.60] P:1941.66 E:0.088090 |  Vierle not picking up Ajax's best header of a football? A very good question
[1635.60 - 1639.68] P:1838.58 E:0.083347 |  Free kick to Tottenham on the halfway line just in front of the where the
[1639.68 - 1643.20] P:1882.50 E:0.093997 |  managers are standing in their technical areas Maurizio Pochettino looks as though
[1643.24 - 1648.48] P:1831.52 E:0.082924 |  he's got the weight of the world on his shoulder at the moment. Alder Vierle to
[1648.48 - 1655.44] P:1804.20 E:0.084607 |  take this free kick. It's going to take it short back to Fautongan in the centre
[1655.44 - 1660.60] P:1683.00 E:0.094963 |  circle and then square towards in fact Tottenham are going backwards into their
[1660.60 - 1667.20] P:2077.02 E:0.104989 |  own half. I notice as we commentate here there's a couple of young people moving
[1667.20 - 1672.16] P:2015.54 E:0.098659 |  around the media area with a tray full of drinks have very thoughtful that is as
[1672.76 - 1677.68] P:2016.91 E:0.096368 |  Alder Vierle is going to play the ball all the way back to Hugo Lurries. Now to
[1677.68 - 1682.04] P:1936.65 E:0.101467 |  Fautongan inside the box passes it just in front of Dolberg out to the right
[1682.04 - 1687.40] P:1939.59 E:0.089456 |  hand side Alder Vierle and then Ericsson comes short Trippie back to Alder
[1687.40 - 1692.48] P:1914.30 E:0.098159 |  Vierle again struggling to get out here but it goes Delialli is beaten in the
[1692.48 - 1697.32] P:1921.97 E:0.089955 |  air by Deliqt stretch from Fautongan to headed to Delialli middle of the Tottenham
[1697.68 - 1702.24] P:1955.67 E:0.100539 |  half. This is rather unconvincing from Spurs here they're really unsettled by
[1702.24 - 1706.40] P:2097.04 E:0.097777 |  Ajax. A little bit too slow at the moment but we talked about Ajax at the
[1706.40 - 1710.56] P:2018.94 E:0.095752 |  start being fearless they're putting a high press on Spurs for that's better
[1710.56 - 1715.16] P:1987.84 E:0.100913 |  from Delialli. Lovely from Delialli, beats two men takes the ball on towards the
[1715.16 - 1720.12] P:1970.30 E:0.086682 |  edge of the penalty area Son low cross to Murat but it deflects off Murat back
[1720.12 - 1724.32] P:1909.13 E:0.093692 |  to Talia Fika who's able to clear to the halfway line but good again from Delialli
[1724.36 - 1728.28] P:1871.93 E:0.088556 |  and here Son on the right hand side receives the ball moves away from
[1728.28 - 1732.56] P:2010.89 E:0.096976 |  Blint, Ericsson centrally back to Sasoko on the right hand side Sasoko
[1732.56 - 1736.16] P:2127.99 E:0.101094 |  looks up low ball to Son near the edge of the penalty area first time touch to
[1736.16 - 1740.40] P:2028.97 E:0.096700 |  Ericsson Ericsson moving from right to left then rolls the ball to Danny Rose
[1740.40 - 1745.20] P:1946.38 E:0.092796 |  puts his foot on it plays it into Ziek and the ball spins away for what is
[1745.20 - 1752.84] P:1744.45 E:0.083203 |  Tottenham's first corner of the match. A better passage of play from Spurs and I
[1752.88 - 1756.88] P:1872.08 E:0.105759 |  tell you I know Ajax are confident playing well only takes a goal from Spurs
[1756.88 - 1765.08] P:1751.39 E:0.076549 |  right back in it and two to the through currently one nil on the night two nil
[1765.08 - 1770.00] P:1854.72 E:0.085790 |  on aggregate to the Dutch league leaders here the ball played in from the
[1770.00 - 1773.80] P:1886.72 E:0.103543 |  left hand side from the corner from Rose Lucas Murat off balance hits the shot
[1773.80 - 1778.56] P:1965.49 E:0.096541 |  but because he was off balance it just screwed away well wide of the right post
[1778.60 - 1784.96] P:1812.58 E:0.085452 |  and it's behind for a goal kick to Ajax who are leading by one goal to nil
[1784.96 - 1789.28] P:1774.99 E:0.086860 |  we'll have more from Darren Fletcher who's back in the five live studio
[1789.28 - 1792.88] P:1757.08 E:0.091645 |  Darren Fletcher played so many Champions League games from Manchester United
[1792.88 - 1796.08] P:1778.93 E:0.097622 |  Chris Sutton here in the stadium with me played so many Champions League games
[1796.08 - 1801.80] P:1742.88 E:0.075815 |  for Celtic and Ajax with the ball back halfway inside their own half and going
[1801.80 - 1806.52] P:1767.79 E:0.091829 |  all the way back to goalkeeper Onana who passes it out towards the far side
[1806.56 - 1811.40] P:1796.63 E:0.099918 |  long pass from Delict he's looking for the Dane Dahlberg through the middle who
[1811.40 - 1817.12] P:1833.08 E:0.092839 |  pulls the ball down and then in steps Alderv Irelts who's able to take the
[1817.12 - 1822.68] P:1894.50 E:0.086238 |  ball away from it. Sissoko passes the ball it takes a deflection Ziek and the
[1822.68 - 1826.16] P:1785.52 E:0.085618 |  ball runs back to Loris who's able to come out and pick the ball up on the
[1826.16 - 1829.36] P:1769.33 E:0.098052 |  edge of the penalty area and we'll hear from another former Manchester United
[1829.36 - 1832.72] P:1859.11 E:0.091038 |  man at half time by the way Phil Neville on the day that he named his England
[1832.76 - 1838.08] P:1773.29 E:0.085359 |  squad for the women's World Cup so Phil Neville at half time here is Sissoko

[1842.40 - 1846.32] P:1805.45 E:0.089585 |  back position Alderv Irelts turns and then we'll clear the ball back into the
[1846.32 - 1851.80] P:1835.08 E:0.087507 |  box to Loris Loris to Fautongan on the edge of the penalty area then back into
[1851.80 - 1856.20] P:1898.81 E:0.103371 |  the six yard box to Loris who signals long has taken the ball right out into
[1856.20 - 1860.28] P:1869.32 E:0.079074 |  the left back position and does hit the long pass but guess who's underneath
[1860.44 - 1866.88] P:1780.62 E:0.082381 |  that delict well don't kick it on him he's there powerhouse the dominant one
[1866.88 - 1871.60] P:1850.40 E:0.079173 |  in the air at the back Loris kicks it straight down his throat and he hasn't
[1871.60 - 1876.60] P:1834.69 E:0.093406 |  missed a thing so far this evening just runs his fingers through that blunt
[1876.60 - 1880.80] P:1735.84 E:0.098010 |  hair as the ball bounces out of play on the far side for a throwing to Ajax who
[1880.80 - 1886.20] P:1793.59 E:0.082621 |  will go back into their own half the atmosphere is vibrant here show the
[1886.24 - 1890.48] P:1770.72 E:0.088897 |  Ajax supporters so many of them will have been confident positive hopeful
[1890.48 - 1895.20] P:1884.02 E:0.094016 |  for heading to Madrid where they'll play Liverpool or a Nana that's a mistake
[1895.20 - 1898.52] P:1882.08 E:0.087618 |  from the Ajax goalkeeper it's kicked the ball straight out of play for a
[1898.52 - 1902.64] P:1851.61 E:0.079222 |  throwing to Tottenham I was gonna say he's usually brilliant with his feet a
[1902.64 - 1906.96] P:1843.06 E:0.078438 |  couple of moments ago I'm glad I didn't here's Ericsson Ericsson infield
[1906.96 - 1911.96] P:1876.92 E:0.088726 |  towards Wanyama Wanyama moving from right to left and then incomes to
[1912.00 - 1916.44] P:1896.57 E:0.091451 |  Vanderbake with a challenge and then De Jong finds Ziek in the centre circle
[1916.44 - 1920.56] P:1953.13 E:0.095222 |  and Ziek's pass out to the left hand side to Tadditch who's cutting into the
[1920.56 - 1924.44] P:1926.61 E:0.096362 |  box now Tadditch against Aldervayra leaves him on the ground shoots right
[1924.44 - 1929.72] P:1871.06 E:0.088884 |  across the face of goal and narrowly wide of the far post and across for a
[1929.72 - 1935.84] P:1971.38 E:0.091067 |  goal kick well Spurs still in this competition by a matter of inches really
[1935.84 - 1941.76] P:1881.61 E:0.086328 |  poor play from Wanyama who's still down in the Ajax half took too long on the
[1941.80 - 1947.04] P:1887.65 E:0.083437 |  ball too many touches it was Vanderbake who stole the ball off him and then
[1947.04 - 1951.84] P:1761.78 E:0.082170 |  released Tadditch and this isn't a Tadditch I remember from Southampton in
[1951.84 - 1957.84] P:1791.02 E:0.094937 |  any way shape or form drives from the left hand side Aldervayra backs off and
[1957.84 - 1963.52] P:1715.25 E:0.099708 |  off and he just pulls the ball with his left foot from an acute angle narrowly
[1963.52 - 1971.60] P:1835.16 E:0.090371 |  passed the far right hand post of Larissa's goal so close Wanyama is on
[1971.64 - 1979.56] P:1855.54 E:0.081800 |  his feet he's okay Dhu San Tadditch has scored 34 goals this season and that is
[1979.56 - 1985.08] P:1874.55 E:0.087175 |  more that's many more than he scored across four seasons for Southampton
[1985.08 - 1990.68] P:1833.00 E:0.094745 |  23 goals in four seasons for Southampton but he's just fitted in here
[1990.68 - 1997.60] P:1849.79 E:0.099662 |  perfectly 22 assists as well as his 34 goals incredible really and he's played
[1997.60 - 2004.36] P:1819.33 E:0.087873 |  a number of positions but mainly as a false nine there's always been a talented
[2004.36 - 2008.88] P:1738.18 E:0.084205 |  footballer just got a stoppage in play Chris at the moment I was wondering what
[2008.88 - 2012.20] P:1799.69 E:0.089716 |  was going on because Larissa's standing with the ball in the six yard box in his
[2012.20 - 2018.52] P:1867.72 E:0.093956 |  hands it's because the referee's microphone is not working and obviously
[2018.52 - 2024.16] P:1911.70 E:0.100972 |  that's absolutely crucial with VAR because he needs to speak to Bastion
[2024.20 - 2031.72] P:1866.88 E:0.096792 |  Dancott and Markle Fritz who are sitting in the video assistant room right
[2031.72 - 2039.48] P:1908.33 E:0.087484 |  they've got that sorted out Iax leading 1-0 BBC Radio 5 live 2-0 on aggregate
[2039.48 - 2044.64] P:1763.33 E:0.075425 |  Tottenham have had chances but the chances have come and gone Son who is
[2044.64 - 2050.56] P:1745.27 E:0.095769 |  is playing mainly on the left hand side Laura mainly through the middle here's
[2050.60 - 2055.88] P:1871.02 E:0.094451 |  Rose Rose incomes the challenge from Schoenach bounces out of play that's
[2055.88 - 2062.00] P:1891.01 E:0.076195 |  given us an Iax throw which Danny Rose protest strongly about throwing is
[2062.00 - 2069.28] P:1883.23 E:0.094778 |  taken and here is Frankie De Jong another of the Iax blonde bombshells back
[2069.28 - 2074.36] P:1868.23 E:0.096128 |  it goes to De Jong and the pass is deflected off son out of play for another
[2074.36 - 2079.68] P:1881.92 E:0.100108 |  throw to Ziek there on the far side it's actually going to be taken by Maizraoui
[2080.44 - 2086.56] P:1969.16 E:0.098974 |  we've played 32 minutes huge screens hanging from the roofs at either end of
[2086.56 - 2092.00] P:1915.84 E:0.079621 |  the stadium high above the two penalty areas little foul and a free kick to
[2092.00 - 2096.52] P:1876.46 E:0.088914 |  Dolberg nearly caught the ball there he has Son playing it in field to the
[2096.52 - 2099.76] P:1949.66 E:0.087236 |  halfway line to Ericsson Ericsson on his left foot passes it straight into
[2099.76 - 2105.84] P:1864.24 E:0.088081 |  Schoenach and now Iax again every minute the ticks by this becomes so much
[2106.04 - 2113.36] P:1856.91 E:0.087242 |  harder for Tottenham you know they've got to win here tonight cannot be extra
[2113.36 - 2119.12] P:1850.13 E:0.107820 |  time now incidentally so we won't have penalties we won't have that sort of
[2119.12 - 2125.12] P:1853.25 E:0.101943 |  drama Tottenham have got to turn this around a 2-1 win on the night would be
[2125.12 - 2129.36] P:1909.47 E:0.101900 |  enough for them with the two away goals but he has Muir on the right hand side
[2129.36 - 2132.48] P:1949.97 E:0.097193 |  daily blint in with a challenge that's good from the moment former Manchester

[2138.20 - 2142.16] P:1790.02 E:0.094932 |  now Ziek in the centre-circle Ziek goes the pass to the right-hand side

[2156.84 - 2162.00] P:1926.15 E:0.088056 |  was able to unforese play the ball back to Onana and again it's with De Jong in

[2177.12 - 2181.12] P:1903.66 E:0.095261 |  Yeah I said De Jong he glides in possession he's got the feet of a
[2181.12 - 2187.36] P:1694.61 E:0.093667 |  ballet dancer he has an outstanding player started off as a centre half and
[2187.40 - 2192.48] P:1832.87 E:0.101815 |  read that situation when Spurs looked like they're getting in behind he has the
[2192.48 - 2199.76] P:1754.83 E:0.087578 |  absolute lot a range of passing knows when to run and when to play.
[2199.76 - 2204.12] P:1701.73 E:0.096538 |  Blint heads along ball for and it's headed away by Tribya Ericsson and then

[2223.92 - 2230.16] P:1946.83 E:0.107268 |  he's into the box now pulls it back C-Hack left foot 2-0 Ajax they're on the
[2230.16 - 2235.96] P:1887.93 E:0.110776 |  way to the final this exciting young team of just torn shot number part again
[2235.96 - 2242.24] P:1846.68 E:0.102022 |  from the angle a left foot shot curled beyond the dive of Luris it's 2-0 on
[2242.28 - 2247.76] P:1863.11 E:0.098915 |  the night it's 3-0 on aggregate surely Tottenham can't come back from this.
[2247.76 - 2255.80] P:1886.63 E:0.105872 |  So long long way back for Spurs but what a finish from ZX the Moroccan magician
[2255.80 - 2262.80] P:1857.41 E:0.110468 |  really good play from Ajax down the left hand side and the ball is weighted into
[2262.80 - 2270.76] P:1892.57 E:0.092293 |  ZX 16 17 yards out on the angle and it's just rolled into his path and he
[2270.80 - 2277.72] P:1900.11 E:0.101423 |  whips the ball superbly across Luris who has no chance Luris floundering at
[2277.72 - 2285.20] P:1846.03 E:0.098173 |  that but what a player what a team what a moment you just don't see it for Spurs
[2285.20 - 2292.12] P:1888.15 E:0.086558 |  now it's a brilliant finish it really was clinical that's what Ajax have been
[2292.12 - 2299.08] P:1729.20 E:0.089095 |  that's what Spurs haven't been that's what they've lacked that clinical edge
[2299.28 - 2307.60] P:1722.03 E:0.093998 |  2-0 on the night 3-0 on aggregate 3-0 when was the last time a team came from

[2321.64 - 2327.28] P:1678.37 E:0.095800 |  mammoth for Tottenham to get through well as the score stands they've got to win
[2327.32 - 2332.40] P:1808.56 E:0.102411 |  3-2 nothing else nothing less than that will do so that would obviously mean
[2332.40 - 2338.52] P:1756.44 E:0.089582 |  that Ajax don't score again and here is Vandabake and ZX just scoring the second
[2338.52 - 2342.68] P:1888.39 E:0.091402 |  goal plays it to Tadda to just set that goal up he's on his right foot ball cut

[2350.92 - 2354.80] P:1702.91 E:0.102264 |  everything up we've hardly mentioned Vandabake what an important player he is
[2355.32 - 2360.04] P:1750.57 E:0.103464 |  just plays in and behind the centre-forward will drift in make penetrating

[2388.84 - 2393.80] P:1777.73 E:0.105280 |  with their shirts off are standing I mean it looks like that stand is moving on

[2407.72 - 2415.00] P:1696.39 E:0.083129 |  prospect of Barcelona against Ajax in the final but it might well be that the
[2415.00 - 2421.36] P:1694.90 E:0.097829 |  club where Johan Cruyff really made his name will be there in the final
[2421.36 - 2427.72] P:1850.35 E:0.099427 |  Tottenham this is spur season John they've got Champions League football I
[2427.72 - 2431.44] P:1788.63 E:0.090300 |  don't think they have to worry too much about things turning around at the
[2431.44 - 2437.56] P:1770.28 E:0.074732 |  weekend they've just got to get one and hope yeah the chances that they've
[2437.60 - 2441.52] P:1767.02 E:0.093651 |  missed they've been costly because then Ajax have scored that second goal
[2441.52 - 2445.24] P:1774.12 E:0.093892 |  here's Ericsson trying to find his way through it's blocked on the edge of the
[2445.24 - 2449.92] P:1787.91 E:0.098220 |  box by Masraoui comes out this is so called chip or it's over the top of
[2449.92 - 2456.96] P:1794.19 E:0.088186 |  Son and now Ziek is there and he under pressure placed the ball out what about
[2456.96 - 2461.36] P:1826.27 E:0.081545 |  what about son on the left-hand side Lucas Moore in the middle do they
[2461.36 - 2465.40] P:1857.00 E:0.075831 |  necessarily need to change anything just yet Tottenham they've had
[2465.44 - 2469.52] P:1848.17 E:0.092727 |  opportunities haven't they and he's elected to start with son but son has
[2469.52 - 2474.52] P:1778.60 E:0.093591 |  drifted out to the right-hand side I just think that second goal has really
[2474.52 - 2479.24] P:1726.25 E:0.089542 |  knocked the stuffing out of Spurs they need to regroup
[2479.24 - 2484.56] P:1882.07 E:0.097088 |  Pocitino has gone to sit down on his seat just next to the mouth of the

[2501.40 - 2506.32] P:1674.91 E:0.088999 |  before Trivia could get there to clear it away on his left foot
[2506.76 - 2512.68] P:1768.18 E:0.098286 |  Tottenham need those moments to turn into clear chances when Ericsson set up

[2517.88 - 2522.28] P:1895.03 E:0.082104 |  Aldervayra 5 minutes to go to halftime just a little bit more than that plus
[2522.28 - 2531.28] P:1774.19 E:0.080332 |  added time song then back to Fatongan Aldervayra's five yards inside the Ajax

[2594.44 - 2597.80] P:2029.90 E:0.101435 |  the center circle and Danny Rose now takes it on towards the edge of the box
[2597.80 - 2603.36] P:1989.45 E:0.096812 |  and gives it to Son who's touch was poor gave the ball straight away to De Jong
[2603.40 - 2608.68] P:1791.29 E:0.074964 |  and now it's up to cottage and I acts are breaking away again De Jong dummy to

[2612.64 - 2616.80] P:1795.94 E:0.100686 |  bearded Dane Schoenig they've been quite wasteful John haven't they Spurs in and
[2616.80 - 2622.88] P:1779.88 E:0.096301 |  around the I X box unlike some there heavy touch the I X defender that's a
[2622.88 - 2627.12] P:1771.13 E:0.091783 |  poor pass from Blink though giving the ball back to Tottenham Tottenham I mean
[2627.12 - 2631.80] P:1778.88 E:0.086200 |  how important how valuable how significant would a goal be for half
[2631.84 - 2636.52] P:1917.80 E:0.083242 |  time be for Spurs absolutely be you're looking for characters now just hang on
[2636.52 - 2641.32] P:1731.69 E:0.082940 |  in there they need a miracle Trippie up curling the ball forward Blink comes
[2641.32 - 2644.84] P:1855.18 E:0.097737 |  across gets there ahead of son who has popped up on the right hand side here
[2644.84 - 2650.80] P:1873.08 E:0.088092 |  but plays it downfield and Aldervire old under pressure from Dolberg has to play
[2650.80 - 2654.84] P:1829.27 E:0.089013 |  it back to his goalkeeper and Laurie's chips at away to the halfway line
[2654.84 - 2659.04] P:1898.11 E:0.095195 |  Masarowe wins that easily and then it's played for by Ziek but the ball will
[2659.08 - 2663.12] P:1921.02 E:0.089041 |  run away over the white line and behind for a goal kick to Tottenham who
[2663.12 - 2668.28] P:1882.94 E:0.082475 |  trailed 2-0 on the night 3-0 on aggregate Chris Sutton that Moroccan
[2668.28 - 2674.36] P:1899.50 E:0.089436 |  connection down the right-hand side it was an opportunity Ziek reverse pass left
[2674.36 - 2683.16] P:1841.09 E:0.076161 |  footed just over hit it looks a real threat doesn't he Ziek he does
[2683.16 - 2687.32] P:1891.85 E:0.107826 |  Tottenham oh Trippie a playing the ball across very nearly gave it to Dolberg
[2687.92 - 2691.16] P:1889.31 E:0.095573 |  Dolberg put in the challenge why you haven't been putting the challenge as
[2691.16 - 2695.80] P:1878.43 E:0.100700 |  well on Lassa sure now the two of them got there at the same time but that was
[2695.80 - 2700.24] P:1849.26 E:0.102435 |  that was a stout challenge from Cicilco and he's left a little bit on sure now
[2700.24 - 2705.48] P:1858.15 E:0.098635 |  who stayed down well I tell you what it was it was a terrible pass from Trippie
[2705.48 - 2715.32] P:1840.42 E:0.091296 |  who has been way off the pace sure now the day steals it off defend that and
[2715.56 - 2723.24] P:1822.15 E:0.076120 |  is a strong challenge from Wanyama free kick then for Ajax yeah as he stepped
[2723.24 - 2726.24] P:1904.81 E:0.088714 |  into the challenge just stepped on the foot the top of his left foot and it's
[2726.24 - 2732.00] P:1906.00 E:0.088790 |  a free kick too far to shoot I think from sure now sure now that's a sure
[2732.00 - 2737.40] P:1850.82 E:0.083549 |  number 20 is back on his feet remember he scored from a free kick against real
[2737.40 - 2741.32] P:1838.75 E:0.087310 |  Madrid plays it into the area it's headed across by delict and then headed out of
[2741.36 - 2747.52] P:1839.69 E:0.096496 |  play by Wanyama and behind and it is a corner for Ajax from the right hand side
[2747.52 - 2750.80] P:1815.95 E:0.090902 |  and they've got Tottenham here just exactly where they want them leading by
[2750.80 - 2755.08] P:1798.96 E:0.084095 |  two goals to nil on the night half-time approaching there'll be no hurry here to
[2755.08 - 2762.48] P:1766.05 E:0.085554 |  take this corner and we see the Tongan now edging over towards delict and
[2762.48 - 2769.52] P:1825.72 E:0.083997 |  Trippie it's very strange why does the Tongan just mark him I mean delict is
[2769.56 - 2773.68] P:1778.82 E:0.094724 |  cowering over Trippie it sort of underlines it really if you weren't
[2773.68 - 2779.32] P:1792.56 E:0.071742 |  listening earlier Trippie delict got away from Trippie in the scoring of the
[2779.32 - 2783.20] P:1788.06 E:0.089709 |  opening goal in the fifth minute corner is eventually taking shots the act plays
[2783.20 - 2786.84] P:1825.06 E:0.095673 |  it back then into the area by Masraoui headed away on the edge of the six yard
[2786.84 - 2791.16] P:1816.39 E:0.084029 |  box by Alderviral Tottenham break Lucas Moura plays it out towards the right
[2791.16 - 2794.80] P:1891.46 E:0.086652 |  hand side Cisoco gets there but the red and white Ajax shirts are dropping back
[2794.80 - 2798.92] P:1902.51 E:0.092358 |  into position and actually Cisoco goes back to Alderviral who chips it airily
[2798.96 - 2805.28] P:1749.25 E:0.081536 |  that's easy for the young to win in the air and it's headed out and down for a
[2805.28 - 2809.04] P:1836.95 E:0.090562 |  throwing fourth official is ready with his board it's been Ajax is half
[2809.04 - 2814.16] P:1855.68 E:0.091480 |  comprehensively they've scored two goals Tottenham have created chances Son hit
[2814.16 - 2819.40] P:1833.73 E:0.086987 |  the post with that effort from the angle Son had the chance saved Ericsson had the
[2819.40 - 2826.32] P:1853.46 E:0.076010 |  shot saved but the chances weren't taken and now where Tottenham are playing the
[2826.32 - 2832.44] P:1852.80 E:0.088699 |  ball back for Tongan to Loris Loris passing it beyond Ziyec Danny Rose now
[2832.44 - 2837.72] P:1896.11 E:0.102808 |  taking it on down the left hand side still going rose the back puts in the
[2837.72 - 2842.40] P:1977.19 E:0.090075 |  challenge to the ball but to the man as well free kick but that's what you're
[2842.40 - 2846.04] P:2000.44 E:0.101630 |  talking about intensity Ziyec shut the goalkeeper down and he must have ran
[2846.04 - 2853.28] P:1851.89 E:0.087716 |  back 70 yards sprinted hurtle back to get the challenge in on Danny Rose
[2853.32 - 2857.56] P:1858.34 E:0.094564 |  Alderviral long ball right down the middle right down the throat of an
[2857.56 - 2862.28] P:1867.77 E:0.088468 |  hour who can come out and catch the ball right in front of his face no problem

[2947.08 - 2950.48] P:1928.20 E:0.096896 |  in the scoring of the first Ajax goal but but otherwise as well he's not had

[2965.60 - 2970.04] P:1903.99 E:0.099062 |  on the way to the final Chris looks that way Spurs needed miracle the worst
[2970.04 - 2974.52] P:1918.27 E:0.089882 |  possible start conceding from a set piece guess who scored it delict the
[2974.52 - 2980.28] P:1855.98 E:0.088899 |  young leader powering a header in and the second goal real quality from Zeik a
[2980.32 - 2985.76] P:1873.19 E:0.093748 |  long long way back for Spurs nigh on impossible but they have to hope they
[2985.76 - 2989.48] P:1872.69 E:0.082294 |  would have seen what happened last night they can turn this round you have to
[2989.48 - 2995.76] P:1884.76 E:0.076455 |  say you just don't see it no delict leading the way through grit from Ajax
[2995.76 - 3004.60] P:1892.09 E:0.073522 |  too good from Ajax 2-0 3-0 on aggregate here in Amsterdam Spurs fans won't
[3004.76 - 3012.40] P:1850.19 E:0.077040 |  agree Chris but they are an absolute joy to watch on the Ajax well yeah
[3012.40 - 3017.32] P:1973.01 E:0.090147 |  absolutely they have been all the way through this season and especially in
[3017.32 - 3022.36] P:2021.89 E:0.090056 |  this competition let's not forget the maturity they showed away from home
[3022.36 - 3027.68] P:1967.52 E:0.079076 |  against Real Madrid and Juventus played both teams off the park they are so
[3027.68 - 3032.12] P:2011.25 E:0.088878 |  assured they trust each other they've been absolutely fantastic I just wondered
[3032.16 - 3036.76] P:2010.20 E:0.080670 |  tonight you know your question you're trying to cling for things for Spurs you
[3036.76 - 3041.32] P:1971.33 E:0.083243 |  know that would they feel the pressure at home soft goal as it was the first one
[3041.32 - 3046.04] P:1934.15 E:0.077099 |  I'm not saying it settled Ajax down I think they play that way anyway but I
[3046.04 - 3049.56] P:1999.59 E:0.086279 |  mean they just look streaks ahead don't they and the biggest issue for Spurs
[3049.56 - 3053.48] P:2032.41 E:0.090221 |  any three goals but you can't can't sit here and say I can't see Ajax scoring
[3053.48 - 3060.36] P:2007.65 E:0.078365 |  again they are ruthless 167 goals that season that's two more goals than
[3060.40 - 3069.48] P:1808.99 E:0.077142 |  canals in Amsterdam thank you that's a that's a impressive stat and the
[3069.48 - 3073.96] P:1822.57 E:0.102156 |  impressive research as well just on the first goal Daraf Lechler alongside me
[3073.96 - 3082.28] P:1800.67 E:0.071638 |  that Chris called soft was actually clever by Ajax but also could have been
[3082.28 - 3086.00] P:1667.90 E:0.088569 |  disallowed I'm surprised it's not chappers you spotted it before me
[3086.12 - 3091.28] P:1590.45 E:0.092836 |  Vanderebeek is completely blocked for Tongan and the Licks got a free header
[3091.28 - 3095.44] P:1643.82 E:0.096921 |  because the Tongan was allocated to Licks wasn't it he was allocated to him so
[3095.44 - 3098.64] P:1636.60 E:0.101899 |  he's marking them all of a sudden just before the kicks taken Vanderebeek
[3098.64 - 3103.12] P:1734.55 E:0.085548 |  steps in front backs him blocks him the Licks gets a free header fantastic
[3103.12 - 3107.16] P:1535.18 E:0.095782 |  will work for my acts but with VAR looking it back I was expecting it to be
[3107.16 - 3112.32] P:1778.98 E:0.082078 |  disallowed but for whatever reason he obviously doesn't think it's a fail but
[3112.36 - 3117.20] P:1776.79 E:0.100263 |  it's a clear fail for me let me read some text Omar on Ajax these I X boys are
[3117.20 - 3122.40] P:1823.04 E:0.091926 |  simply these I X boys exclamation marks simply brilliant display of character
[3122.40 - 3127.20] P:1705.85 E:0.097630 |  from them under the leadership of a team it's crazy Max as a football fan
[3127.20 - 3130.92] P:1813.37 E:0.104319 |  watching Ajax play is a bit like going to a Michelin star restaurant for dinner
[3130.92 - 3135.56] P:1895.65 E:0.092738 |  yes it's just football but it's just beautifully done Jack not an anti
[3135.56 - 3138.72] P:1842.42 E:0.097581 |  spurs thing but this I X team were an absolute joy to watch it would do the
[3138.72 - 3142.56] P:1759.74 E:0.091254 |  Champions League a great service if a team that has spent as little as I X
[3142.56 - 3148.72] P:1801.22 E:0.079305 |  win the final in possession and out of possession you could just see how well
[3148.72 - 3154.52] P:1788.20 E:0.070341 |  coached and drilled they are listen everyone talk about I X in possession
[3154.52 - 3157.52] P:1397.82 E:0.098389 |  because the different spurs that looks like hard work when they're playing out
[3157.52 - 3163.24] P:1417.35 E:0.090977 |  I actually simple but their energy and their work rate is unbelievable you know
[3163.24 - 3168.04] P:1593.97 E:0.099638 |  no egos in the team they're all helping each other their pressman numbers
[3168.20 - 3171.60] P:1516.68 E:0.094514 |  they're stifling spurs the odd time spurs have broke through the press they
[3171.60 - 3175.48] P:1559.04 E:0.082072 |  have looked dangerous but it's very very difficult to watch them do it they
[3175.48 - 3179.12] P:1642.39 E:0.100806 |  know it's a struggle I X of put them under so much pressure but then amazingly
[3179.12 - 3182.76] P:1673.89 E:0.078938 |  when they went when they went to up they completely changed and they went into a
[3182.76 - 3185.96] P:1468.14 E:0.091358 |  low block and they let spurs pass the ball in front of them and now they're
[3185.96 - 3188.96] P:1267.99 E:0.091795 |  conserving energy because they know it's going to be a long game and spurs have
[3188.96 - 3192.12] P:1464.87 E:0.085974 |  to do something special now to beat them a second goal was fantastic as well
[3192.12 - 3197.60] P:1581.83 E:0.071267 |  what finish the way to pass from Tadich but what a finish from the lad you know
[3197.64 - 3201.56] P:1588.06 E:0.079681 |  he's got his head down and he's whipped the ball left foot and the back and it
[3201.56 - 3208.64] P:1608.82 E:0.093340 |  fantastic as the echo who is on Ramadan at the moment and actually after 24

[3472.24 - 3475.36] P:1287.12 E:0.078904 |  moment's been coming for a long time I think the growth has been incredible
[3475.40 - 3479.04] P:1536.32 E:0.088816 |  probably quicker than probably what people can sometimes handle but what I
[3479.04 - 3482.40] P:1540.89 E:0.093279 |  would say the work that the guys have done on the announcement today I think
[3482.40 - 3486.28] P:1347.75 E:0.082665 |  probably took my players breath away I've got to say that they were blown away
[3486.28 - 3489.08] P:1510.02 E:0.091162 |  with it it was surprised they did not know what was happening we wanted to
[3489.08 - 3495.28] P:1659.03 E:0.079695 |  reward them for what was has been a tremendous journey for them and to give
[3495.28 - 3499.36] P:1513.61 E:0.089036 |  them a platform individually to tell the world that they're going to a World
[3499.36 - 3502.48] P:1468.58 E:0.083723 |  Cup the World Cup is a pinnacle you know nobody should be embarrassed nobody
[3502.48 - 3505.76] P:1665.74 E:0.086547 |  should be shy about telling the world that you're going to a World Cup you
[3505.76 - 3509.72] P:1685.17 E:0.086719 |  know it's the announcements there it's been done everyone's excited about it

[3519.48 - 3524.36] P:1792.31 E:0.088747 |  think the the squad chappers was was largely expected Steph Horton of course
[3524.36 - 3528.76] P:1741.76 E:0.097014 |  the Manchester City skipper leading the side no real big surprises in terms of
[3528.76 - 3532.56] P:1586.29 E:0.107318 |  inclusions and great to see Beth Mead in their very talented young forward
[3532.56 - 3537.32] P:1904.22 E:0.098725 |  impressed as Arsenal won the title this season she's one of 11 players who will
[3537.32 - 3542.16] P:1819.79 E:0.095511 |  be heading to their first ever World Cup and England really do have a plethora of
[3542.16 - 3546.28] P:1729.81 E:0.083782 |  young attacking talent the likes of Georgia's Stanway of Manchester City the
[3546.28 - 3551.20] P:1952.04 E:0.091531 |  PFA young player of the year Nikita Paris also of Manchester City has had a
[3551.20 - 3555.40] P:1918.50 E:0.105431 |  brilliant season as well Fran Kirby also makes it now she's been managing a knee
[3555.44 - 3559.80] P:2009.89 E:0.096549 |  problem recently but has been playing for Chelsea which is key and then you have
[3559.80 - 3564.48] P:1848.21 E:0.088966 |  the more experienced heads like Horton like Chelsea captain Karen Carney like
[3564.48 - 3568.48] P:1832.42 E:0.093434 |  Manchester City's Jill Scott so it's a really exciting blend of youth and
[3568.48 - 3572.40] P:1978.31 E:0.089567 |  experience and the main thing is the young players are still players that
[3572.40 - 3576.08] P:1414.46 E:0.103151 |  are winning things at the top level which will be important going into this
[3576.08 - 3579.08] P:1681.80 E:0.108952 |  tournament and despite as you said the 11 players who made their World Cup
[3579.08 - 3582.96] P:1802.46 E:0.078484 |  debuts they've still had international experience with things like the she
[3583.00 - 3587.16] P:1820.44 E:0.078448 |  believes cut absolutely I mean the she believes cut was such an important win
[3587.16 - 3590.52] P:1747.99 E:0.108365 |  for England that was the invitational tournament earlier this year hosted by
[3590.52 - 3594.72] P:1793.88 E:0.093892 |  the USA Brazil and Japan were involved as well and England won that for the
[3594.72 - 3597.96] P:1618.11 E:0.096039 |  first time and managed to get a draw against the USA who are the current
[3597.96 - 3602.16] P:1863.78 E:0.092107 |  world champions so yeah as you say they have experience at international level
[3602.16 - 3607.16] P:1807.82 E:0.094141 |  a lot of them played at Euro 2017 that was quite a few of those players first
[3607.16 - 3610.96] P:1864.07 E:0.089079 |  major tournament and they've been winning things at domestic level they've
[3611.00 - 3614.52] P:1527.30 E:0.110201 |  been going far in the Champions League over recent years particularly with

[3932.68 - 3939.08] P:1959.34 E:0.094577 |  from the board that it is Victor Wanyama who makes way and Jorente comes on so
[3939.08 - 3943.56] P:2039.19 E:0.096825 |  now the Tottenham team Chris Sutton, Loris, Trippia Alderviral, Fertonghenan,

[3952.96 - 3960.28] P:1954.93 E:0.100852 |  Yep and he's a Marigio Pocciudino has gone all in Wanyama and Cisoco the two
[3961.92 - 3967.20] P:1879.29 E:0.097388 |  so-called protectors in the first half for Tottenham looks like Erickson will go
[3967.20 - 3974.68] P:1918.67 E:0.105067 |  in now alongside Cisoco in that central midfield area but Lorente needs
[3974.68 - 3981.60] P:1897.12 E:0.100201 |  service he had no choice really got the hope they can get a goal early in this
[3981.60 - 3986.28] P:1897.54 E:0.089091 |  second half and go from there they have to believe they do
[3987.48 - 3991.84] P:1984.53 E:0.092433 |  Ajax to kick off at the start of the second half as they started the match with
[3991.84 - 3997.76] P:1932.43 E:0.099259 |  Anana in goal back four of Mas Raui, Delict, Blint and Talia Fico, Schöner,
[3997.76 - 4004.12] P:1782.74 E:0.085850 |  Vanderbake and De Jong in the middle and then Ziek on the right, Tadich on the
[4004.12 - 4009.80] P:1961.07 E:0.099598 |  left and Dolberg as the central striker after David Neres was ruled out with an
[4009.80 - 4014.72] P:1999.74 E:0.093306 |  injury in the warm-up so Dolberg came in to replace him for the start of the
[4014.72 - 4019.64] P:1839.71 E:0.089753 |  match a very loud announcement being made for the I presume the Tottenham
[4019.68 - 4023.84] P:1936.94 E:0.085544 |  supporters throwing to spurs immediately down the left-hand side Tottenham
[4023.84 - 4028.08] P:1811.50 E:0.084083 |  well obviously need an early goal apparently I've just been told that the
[4028.08 - 4032.08] P:1819.17 E:0.095011 |  top trends on social media in the UK at the moment are Ajax and Tottenham,
[4032.08 - 4041.08] P:1788.48 E:0.082640 |  Trippia, Ziek, Delict, Wanyama, Tadich, De Jong and Archie, I hadn't seen that at the
[4041.08 - 4045.44] P:1840.88 E:0.093327 |  bottom I wondered why I'd been given that here is Jurente plays it through into
[4045.44 - 4049.44] P:1996.57 E:0.097965 |  the penalty area stretch from Delict under pressure from Delia Li and it's
[4049.44 - 4054.20] P:1824.62 E:0.092630 |  gone straight behind for a corner yes a good turn from Lorenzo and he scooped
[4054.20 - 4059.12] P:1965.90 E:0.097632 |  the ball over Delict who actually read the situation well and he got a vital
[4059.12 - 4066.08] P:1767.30 E:0.078665 |  touch full stretch left-footed and goes behind Delia Li would have been in with
[4066.08 - 4071.04] P:1860.30 E:0.084623 |  an easy finish so it's a corner for Tottenham from the left-hand side set
[4071.04 - 4076.00] P:1926.71 E:0.096062 |  peace chance Tottenham need these need a goal Ericsson plays it in to the the
[4076.04 - 4081.04] P:1780.86 E:0.092647 |  post that's where Aldervireld was making his run but the two Ajax man men there I
[4081.04 - 4085.08] P:1794.29 E:0.102597 |  think it might well have been Delict who got the header away and now Trippia
[4085.08 - 4089.68] P:1885.15 E:0.101562 |  brings it forward but loses possession he's tackled Van der Beek across the
[4089.68 - 4094.40] P:1862.26 E:0.087559 |  field to the left-hand side to Tadich who just had to wait for the ball and in
[4094.40 - 4099.44] P:1895.40 E:0.094733 |  so in doing so the momentum then slowed and Tadich's passes beyond Ziek and
[4099.44 - 4103.24] P:1801.90 E:0.093624 |  through for Goldberg. There's a real opportunity as a can poor play from
[4103.28 - 4109.00] P:1741.55 E:0.091665 |  Trippia maybe an argument that he should have been hooked a half time 3v2 for
[4109.00 - 4114.96] P:1701.37 E:0.089931 |  Ajax the ball from Van der Beek was behind Tadich and the momentum was lost.
[4114.96 - 4124.52] P:1762.39 E:0.086286 |  2-0 3-0 on aggregate so Tottenham really do need a footballing miracle here at
[4124.52 - 4131.40] P:1800.92 E:0.086272 |  the home of Ajax of Amsterdam the Johan Cruyff Arena where you really cannot
[4131.48 - 4138.00] P:1801.46 E:0.087068 |  avoid the image of Johan Cruyff all around this place there's an absolutely
[4138.00 - 4142.28] P:1847.37 E:0.100636 |  fantastic black and white photograph right at the top of the escalators here
[4142.28 - 4147.32] P:1820.59 E:0.090461 |  at the highest level of the stand down at the bottom there's a bronze bust of
[4147.32 - 4155.72] P:1834.66 E:0.081196 |  Johan Cruyff's face his influence is just across Ajax across Dutch football
[4155.76 - 4165.40] P:1831.54 E:0.092789 |  European football is immense it's like a monument to the man here is Lucas

[4169.52 - 4177.28] P:1791.05 E:0.082467 |  here's Mazraoui Ziek comes short Ziek's pass straight at Danny Rose and Tottenham

[4184.72 - 4189.04] P:1800.24 E:0.084299 |  forward forward now from there from Mazraoui but Tottenham have got that back
[4189.04 - 4197.88] P:1769.21 E:0.093451 |  in front of their own penalty area so 2-0 this goal 3-0 on aggregate so Spurs are
[4197.88 - 4205.12] P:1785.92 E:0.090833 |  looking here at having to win by three goals to two on the night three goals

[4223.88 - 4228.64] P:1821.28 E:0.083963 |  say what why couldn't you find me Tottenham come again Ericsson on the
[4228.64 - 4232.28] P:1801.21 E:0.089608 |  right-hand side Ericsson Ericsson's curling ball into the box delict is there
[4232.28 - 4235.28] P:1725.40 E:0.094691 |  to hit it away on the half ball he rather scuffed the clearance but got it away
[4235.28 - 4239.76] P:1830.73 E:0.096860 |  in any case then fires the ball up towards Dolberg the blonde head dint

[4276.40 - 4283.40] P:1729.76 E:0.091682 |  2-0 and Tottenham with it on the right-hand side Kieran Trippier you know the fact that
[4283.40 - 4288.72] P:1661.14 E:0.096174 |  Kieran Trippier was trending on social media I'm sure he'll be receiving a great
[4288.76 - 4292.72] P:1609.18 E:0.100828 |  deal of criticism on there we obviously highlighted the way that he's played but

[4889.44 - 4895.64] P:1741.30 E:0.087670 |  in four minutes and now Chris what we said about the weight of expectation a
[4895.64 - 4900.40] P:1790.63 E:0.098225 |  test for this largely young team well they've been rocked back by Tottenham
[4900.44 - 4906.00] P:1892.43 E:0.099911 |  however here's Ziak rides the challenge Ziak shot kicks a deflection which took
[4906.00 - 4909.32] P:1857.54 E:0.113590 |  it wide of goal and behind for a corner. Well do you know what I think Ajax are
[4909.32 - 4913.48] P:1839.55 E:0.103041 |  thinking now we need to score again because Spurs are creating chances
[4913.48 - 4919.12] P:1660.03 E:0.103716 |  let's get back on the front foot. Apparently there is a row of
[4919.12 - 4923.16] P:1781.18 E:0.097383 |  Tottenham fans behind us and it was them that were celebrating and throwing the
[4923.16 - 4928.40] P:1805.88 E:0.088525 |  pier it's a corner Ziak to take it Ziak to the edge of the six yard box it's
[4928.44 - 4932.64] P:1715.60 E:0.098225 |  headed down and away by Llorente who was back in there in the middle of all that
[4932.64 - 4936.84] P:1781.13 E:0.096950 |  the second goal Llorente the chance that he wasn't able to score a save from
[4936.84 - 4943.56] P:1727.16 E:0.092756 |  point blank range by your Nana however Lucas Moura did ever so well to win the
[4943.56 - 4947.00] P:1827.75 E:0.099752 |  ball back the loose ball inside the penalty area turn on to his left foot and
[4947.00 - 4952.12] P:1802.33 E:0.094559 |  lash it in from seven or eight yards. Fantastic finish but I think it was seven
[4952.12 - 4957.72] P:1863.31 E:0.106125 |  euros fifty for a pint last night I wouldn't be wasting my beer. Here's Llorente
[4957.76 - 4963.64] P:1788.26 E:0.106664 |  now on his left foot shoots for goal and it's wildly wide and high and behind
[4963.64 - 4968.20] P:1741.67 E:0.096079 |  and he hangs his head. Well I've never seen him score from outside the box he
[4968.20 - 4973.72] P:1757.62 E:0.103461 |  probably has but with his weaker foot off balance and better serve give it to Moura
[4973.72 - 4981.28] P:1754.44 E:0.084402 |  he's the man in form. So it's on it's on for Tottenham they're still behind three
[4981.28 - 4986.64] P:1696.29 E:0.084760 |  two on aggregate but one more goal without reply and it would be Tottenham
[4986.68 - 4992.12] P:1896.84 E:0.095709 |  Liverpool in the final. It's played up towards Tadich who is shoulder to shoulder
[4992.12 - 4996.72] P:1861.65 E:0.103701 |  with Patongan and it is the Belgian who gets the touch behind corner Ajax.
[4996.72 - 5002.20] P:1770.57 E:0.097223 |  I'll tell you what now John you can smell the fear in this stadium they've had it
[5002.20 - 5008.52] P:1713.79 E:0.092603 |  in their hands Ajax. Don't smell the fear I can smell the beer. Zeeak here's the
[5008.52 - 5012.08] P:1916.08 E:0.101989 |  corner towards the back post headed down by Delik but Tottenham have done the job
[5012.12 - 5018.60] P:1854.73 E:0.094109 |  on him went down then the shot flies in from daily blink from 25 yards plus and
[5018.60 - 5023.84] P:1778.92 E:0.085981 |  it flew over the top of the crossbar. It wasn't far away good first touch
[5023.84 - 5030.68] P:1643.16 E:0.097346 |  allowed him to get the shot off. Bouncing ball a yard over Larissa's bar just
[5030.68 - 5035.00] P:1786.30 E:0.103960 |  watching the Spurs goal again it is an unbelievable piece of goalkeeping from
[5035.00 - 5040.60] P:1617.60 E:0.096890 |  Anana to block Llorente but then the scramble from Schoenig he panics Moura
[5041.12 - 5043.64] P:1831.52 E:0.099920 |  Composure personified finishes it off.
[5046.24 - 5053.24] P:1798.73 E:0.100799 |  We have less than half an hour to play. 2-2 on the night but here come Ajax and Zeeak
[5053.24 - 5060.36] P:1831.00 E:0.100620 |  with a chance that is wide on his left foot from 12 yards out the cross from
[5060.36 - 5065.96] P:1832.11 E:0.088350 |  the left from Taliofico perfect for Zeeak and he swept it wide.
[5066.32 - 5070.12] P:1821.22 E:0.106209 |  Good move down the left hand side pulled across Zeeak doesn't break his
[5070.12 - 5076.52] P:1708.86 E:0.104419 |  stride 12 yards out left hand side of the goal goes down his hands and these
[5076.52 - 5083.40] P:1797.24 E:0.101033 |  inches pass that far post Tottenham breathe a big sigh of relief. Now Tottenham
[5083.40 - 5088.36] P:1908.26 E:0.098397 |  come again Delhi Ali was so close to finding the pass through to Son it was
[5088.36 - 5092.68] P:1961.44 E:0.098938 |  intercepted and cut out by Delik though here's Sussoko Tottenham are now
[5092.72 - 5096.24] P:1942.22 E:0.097990 |  finding space all over the place son on the right son in the full back
[5096.24 - 5100.12] P:1863.43 E:0.096226 |  position into the box now two Ajax man there Trippias available here's the
[5100.12 - 5103.84] P:1899.66 E:0.105678 |  cross from Trippia headed down by Llorente comes back to look as Moura whose shot is
[5103.84 - 5109.28] P:1820.12 E:0.102365 |  deflected off to lift and wide and behind corner. What's the block from Delik?
[5109.28 - 5116.68] P:1716.91 E:0.102167 |  Llorente headed a ball breaks Moura 12 yards out hammers the shot Delik dives to
[5116.68 - 5121.64] P:1641.85 E:0.101617 |  his left hand side and the ball goes past for a Tottenham corner. This
[5122.00 - 5127.64] P:1755.34 E:0.097954 |  Champions League semi-final has just gone absolutely crazy to corner from the
[5127.64 - 5131.36] P:1855.80 E:0.098787 |  right for Tottenham here's the delivery and a stretch from Llorente it's headed
[5131.36 - 5136.24] P:1724.04 E:0.101864 |  up by Llorente. I thought it came off Blint. I think it did and that's a
[5136.24 - 5142.88] P:1669.04 E:0.096622 |  mismatch against Llorente he has caused problems physical presence get the
[5142.88 - 5151.04] P:1570.24 E:0.084111 |  ball into him Moura buzzing in and around him the spurs on the offensive
[5151.24 - 5156.92] P:1812.51 E:0.089944 |  two two and it's a gold kick for Ajax and the referee is onto this telling
[5156.92 - 5163.00] P:1672.55 E:0.085204 |  Anana to get on with it Ajax are looking to waste time by the way everything
[5163.00 - 5167.76] P:1697.26 E:0.091088 |  seems to be calm behind us where the Tottenham fans are in the stand in
[5167.76 - 5171.28] P:1770.43 E:0.100625 |  amongst the Ajax fans they threw the beer but everything seems to have been
[5171.28 - 5177.68] P:1715.23 E:0.093564 |  quite cordial in all honesty. It wasn't cordial though.
[5177.84 - 5182.84] P:1768.60 E:0.092164 |  Here's Trippie I can still smell it but my notes are soaked. Here's Trippie
[5182.84 - 5186.80] P:1873.30 E:0.096722 |  forward to Deli Alley. Deli Alley on the left hand side they've come to life now
[5186.80 - 5190.80] P:1914.77 E:0.097616 |  Tottenham here's Sone he's popped up on the left hand side Sone is away between
[5190.80 - 5194.48] P:1927.63 E:0.102479 |  two Ajax men into the box challenge came in the ball bounces back to the edge of
[5194.48 - 5201.76] P:1832.07 E:0.095003 |  the area and the referee has given that. A push from Sone. A bit harsh.
[5202.12 - 5206.56] P:1640.09 E:0.099769 |  He's looked at danger off the left-hand side. Chris quickly because we haven't
[5206.56 - 5210.64] P:1795.00 E:0.110917 |  got a chance. Darren Fletcher in the studio mentioned about the first goal
[5210.64 - 5216.92] P:1722.47 E:0.103623 |  that Deli scored but maybe BAR could have picked that up for a foul by
[5216.92 - 5221.08] P:1727.54 E:0.097213 |  Vanderbake on Fertongan. I don't think it was clear and obvious I think the bigger
[5221.08 - 5226.96] P:1657.80 E:0.085444 |  issue for Spurs is why was Trippie picking up Deli and not Fertongan and
[5226.96 - 5231.04] P:1880.04 E:0.097273 |  Fertongan was wrong side of Vanderbake anyway. Tottenham are in the mood now
[5231.08 - 5234.88] P:1936.64 E:0.105596 |  Ericsson with a long pass forward to Urenti. Urenti square to Deli Alley.
[5234.88 - 5240.24] P:1867.20 E:0.098101 |  Ajax are chasing shadows here. Deli Alley now to the man the two-goal man Lucas
[5240.24 - 5243.96] P:1964.01 E:0.102817 |  Moura. Trippie is arriving on the right-hand side. Trippie has cross hits the
[5243.96 - 5248.68] P:1869.43 E:0.093938 |  defender. Talia Fico and deflect behind. Past the near post and behind for
[5248.68 - 5252.00] P:1783.34 E:0.104517 |  Kona. I thought for a moment there it might fly into his own net. It's Alio.
[5252.00 - 5256.20] P:1774.18 E:0.099025 |  It's Spurs with the courage in this second half. They've been down and out in
[5256.24 - 5263.24] P:1754.41 E:0.085256 |  this competition before. Just one goal. Son swells the ball in from the right but
[5263.24 - 5267.52] P:1844.15 E:0.095120 |  we're beyond anyone inside the penalty area. He was looking for Urenti. Urenti
[5267.52 - 5274.44] P:1923.50 E:0.099075 |  just made a late across to him and we will see another Ajax change. Eric Ken
[5274.44 - 5280.36] P:1986.78 E:0.092613 |  Hark is concerned about what he's seeing here. Already Schoenert has been
[5280.36 - 5286.04] P:1887.10 E:0.084899 |  withdrawn and now it's going to be Dolberg who is making way having been
[5286.04 - 5290.16] P:1784.48 E:0.092870 |  drafted in right at the last moment to start this match when David Nere has
[5290.16 - 5299.68] P:1916.63 E:0.090709 |  picked up an injury. And it is Daly Sinkgraven who's coming on who can play
[5299.68 - 5303.56] P:1871.09 E:0.086216 |  left back. He can play in midfield and he's going out there to the left-hand
[5303.56 - 5308.00] P:1851.94 E:0.082285 |  side. The number eight Netherlands under 21 international. Here's another young
[5308.00 - 5315.20] P:1814.42 E:0.091829 |  young prospect Sinkgraven. Another versatile player and Taditch goes.
[5316.16 - 5319.32] P:1722.27 E:0.108141 |  Up in the centre forward or false nine role.
[5322.52 - 5329.32] P:1618.35 E:0.088378 |  Ajax two. Tottenham two. Tottenham have come from two nil down. Two Lucas
[5329.32 - 5336.88] P:1707.38 E:0.092447 |  Moura goals in the 55th and the 59th minutes of the match. We have
[5336.88 - 5343.04] P:1756.29 E:0.100313 |  delict playing the ball to Daly Blint who's past is out of play and suddenly
[5343.04 - 5348.32] P:1727.78 E:0.091117 |  they are rattled here Ajax. And if Spurs get another I mean could this
[5348.32 - 5361.92] P:1744.89 E:0.080735 |  eclipse Liverpool from last night? I would say no but it's not far short. The ball
[5361.92 - 5369.80] P:1882.79 E:0.094563 |  comes back to Alderviral. Turns and gives it to Lorese. We're into the last
[5369.80 - 5373.80] P:1788.87 E:0.090102 |  quarter of the match now. Jurenti wins a header. Daly Ali it flicks his heels
[5373.80 - 5378.12] P:1755.41 E:0.096580 |  actually and bounces back. Jurenti has then beaten to it by De Jong. Now
[5378.12 - 5386.12] P:1770.94 E:0.079577 |  van der Beek. Van der Beek to Ziak. Ziak back onto his left foot. Clays the ball
[5386.12 - 5391.88] P:1760.05 E:0.093625 |  back towards the halfway line and then De Jong. The touch from Masraoui. Masraoui
[5391.88 - 5396.36] P:1844.69 E:0.098181 |  now to the right-hand side to Ziak. Ziak rolls it across Masraoui in the box.
[5396.52 - 5400.60] P:1891.62 E:0.095107 |  Turns, shoots, hits the shins of Katongan and then Danny Rose is able just to
[5401.64 - 5405.64] P:1862.06 E:0.102387 |  touch it away. However Ziak's back in possession going around the outside of
[5405.64 - 5408.92] P:1920.17 E:0.106078 |  Rose and then Daly Ali puts in the challenge but the flags up.
[5409.48 - 5414.44] P:2021.73 E:0.108131 |  They went out for a throw in. And now Daly Ali just needs to keep us cool here
[5414.44 - 5417.96] P:1878.91 E:0.100540 |  because he's walking past Ziak who's clearly had something to say but
[5417.96 - 5423.96] P:1750.79 E:0.097517 |  fortunately he has been sensible enough just to move away from the situation.
[5424.36 - 5427.00] P:1822.70 E:0.113370 |  It's getting hot in here isn't it?
[5427.64 - 5435.40] P:1774.53 E:0.101720 |  What a tension. Ziak and Ali. Ziak pointing the finger at Ali but he had
[5435.40 - 5441.40] P:1799.47 E:0.078653 |  run the ball out of play. Ajax 2, Tottenham 2, 3-2. Tyaks in the second leg of this
[5441.40 - 5448.28] P:1815.42 E:0.090087 |  semi-final. Liverpool waiting. They'll be in Madrid on June the first. We'll be there as
[5448.28 - 5452.36] P:1897.98 E:0.086292 |  well. Five live for the commentary on the Champions League final. This time
[5452.36 - 5457.56] P:1857.64 E:0.093080 |  tomorrow night Europa League semi-final commentary live from Valencia with
[5457.56 - 5463.72] P:1802.00 E:0.089704 |  Alistair Bruce Ball and Don Hutchison. Valencia Arsenal and will also be at Chelsea
[5463.72 - 5470.36] P:1743.62 E:0.092202 |  for their second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt. One more goal without reply and we would have
[5471.24 - 5479.96] P:1772.94 E:0.089809 |  a Champions League final involving two English clubs. Here's De Jong. De Jong to Vandermake
[5480.04 - 5484.28] P:1949.60 E:0.104325 |  who under pressure from Fertong and managed to find the pass to Masraoui. Masraoui now.
[5484.92 - 5488.92] P:1933.85 E:0.096325 |  Ziak left-footed, clips it to the back post. It's tested down by Taditch and
[5488.92 - 5493.48] P:1864.82 E:0.101409 |  Tribia makes a crucial interception to put it behind for a corner. Well why didn't
[5493.48 - 5498.52] P:1853.28 E:0.108565 |  Taditch leave that to St Graven who was behind him and would have had a free head as a lovely ball
[5499.24 - 5503.40] P:1853.07 E:0.098940 |  from Ziak who chops inside on the right-hand side and just feeds it
[5505.08 - 5508.84] P:1841.81 E:0.094241 |  into the far post. Taditch I thought he should have left it.
[5508.84 - 5514.68] P:1885.06 E:0.087191 |  But getting some answers now though from Ajax they've recovered after the jolt of those two goals.
[5514.68 - 5519.40] P:1891.23 E:0.091040 |  Ziak with a corner, delict heads it across the penalty area away by Lucas Moura then headed
[5519.40 - 5525.72] P:1902.17 E:0.091380 |  back by St Graven to Ziak. Ziak's cross, Laurie's comes he gets a hand to it, delicts and the
[5525.72 - 5530.36] P:1922.60 E:0.107921 |  penalty area on the right-hand side, delicts right in across, Laurie makes the save he pushes it
[5530.36 - 5536.04] P:1843.38 E:0.105605 |  out into the penalty area and he's fortunate there that it fell to a top-n-foot to clear.
[5536.12 - 5541.56] P:1850.01 E:0.103759 |  Oh I think Larisse gets lucky twice, flaps at the first one and just pushes it to delict.
[5542.28 - 5548.92] P:1768.36 E:0.094770 |  It's a good cutback from delict fired across and Larisse gambles, gets a right-hand to it, pushes it
[5549.72 - 5555.48] P:1789.14 E:0.098600 |  centrally into the box but Tottenham scramble clear. One of the last 20 minutes now the Ajax
[5555.48 - 5560.36] P:1986.06 E:0.101114 |  supporters the crowd here in the Johan Cruyff arena trying to do their bit and see the team through
[5560.36 - 5565.80] P:1896.66 E:0.089932 |  to the Champions League final. They're edging it just at the moment but that is all it is
[5565.80 - 5571.00] P:1913.19 E:0.097962 |  and here now Ajax with the ball on the left-hand side and oh a challenge by Trippier on the edge
[5571.00 - 5575.96] P:2118.06 E:0.109343 |  of the box they're howling for a free kick referee Brick says no and Tottenham clear it downfield.
[5575.96 - 5580.60] P:2056.22 E:0.094031 |  Well I think he tries to buy that Ducan Tadich on his way down.
[5583.72 - 5588.12] P:1811.25 E:0.096691 |  Ajax start again, daily bling thought he passed it out of play but it was kept in by St Graven
[5588.12 - 5592.04] P:1895.04 E:0.095366 |  then the ball through the middle for Tadich, Fatongan goes across with him a back heel by
[5592.04 - 5596.36] P:1886.97 E:0.098547 |  Tadich but he rather telegraphed that and Aldervayral was able to put it across the field.
[5596.36 - 5599.32] P:1901.10 E:0.107594 |  The ball was offside Tadich initially eventually the flag
[5600.84 - 5607.00] P:1685.99 E:0.096647 |  goes up but Ajax have responded a little bit they're trying to get another goal
[5608.12 - 5610.44] P:1793.32 E:0.109880 |  they just leave the backdoor open for Spurs.
[5612.28 - 5617.40] P:1768.75 E:0.097556 |  Free kick to Tottenham on the edge of their own area I suspect Lucas Moura will now be trending
[5617.48 - 5624.20] P:1750.32 E:0.084247 |  ahead of Archie, poor Archie, he's just been born, he had Victor Wanyama trending above him in the
[5624.20 - 5628.84] P:1796.50 E:0.094091 |  first half. Here he's off the field now though so he'll probably have dropped down the pecking order.
[5631.16 - 5637.40] P:1721.36 E:0.093406 |  The ball played back by Ajax to daily bling, we're setting ourselves for what could be a dramatic
[5637.40 - 5642.60] P:1774.57 E:0.094108 |  finale to these two nights of Champions League semi-finals that have provided some
[5642.68 - 5647.16] P:1829.62 E:0.098347 |  thrills and spills for us haven't they? Here's Aldervayral playing the ball back towards
[5647.16 - 5654.76] P:1924.17 E:0.098927 |  Laurie's alone red and white Ajax flag with the the image of the great warrior, the mythical
[5654.76 - 5660.92] P:1816.11 E:0.092615 |  warrior Ajax right in the middle of it. Here Tripier plays the ball forward, lovely from
[5660.92 - 5666.12] P:1905.30 E:0.095891 |  Llorente takes the ball down gives it to Deli Alli, Deli Alli's cross into the shins of
[5666.12 - 5670.52] P:1851.69 E:0.094722 |  delift straight behind corner to Tottenham from the right. Well that they're playing to his strengths
[5670.52 - 5675.40] P:1919.89 E:0.103996 |  Llorente has a lovely ball into him but he takes it on his chest on the heart and slides the ball
[5675.40 - 5684.60] P:1710.14 E:0.095667 |  into Alli who fires it off deli and wins the corner. He's changed the game, Llorente, since he came on
[5684.60 - 5690.68] P:1873.99 E:0.090096 |  even though these missed chances, he's had an awful shot at goal, it's what they call a curate egg.
[5691.32 - 5697.96] P:1948.76 E:0.100472 |  Here's Tripier, Tripier with the corner headed to the new post, wide of the far post by Aldervayral.
[5698.20 - 5704.84] P:1714.01 E:0.088925 |  Kets up well, it's a good corner, outswinger from Tripier, pace on the ball,
[5705.56 - 5713.08] P:1819.48 E:0.108958 |  Aldervayral level with the near post, six seven yards out, just can't get it on target and Anana,
[5713.08 - 5714.12] P:1911.88 E:0.118765 |  he's not rushing.
[5717.40 - 5725.48] P:1862.69 E:0.089837 |  Archie's hanging in there, apparently on the trending, Anana's now involved, it's a goal kick
[5726.28 - 5735.00] P:1782.08 E:0.094329 |  to Ajax and Anana is taking his time, television cameraman appears from nowhere in front of us
[5735.00 - 5739.96] P:1859.92 E:0.101495 |  and walks along in front of our bench, they're beginning to move towards their positions for the
[5739.96 - 5746.36] P:1738.69 E:0.088272 |  end of the match, that's a concern for Tottenham, they need another goal, here's Deli Alli, Cisoco,
[5746.36 - 5752.20] P:1850.93 E:0.104421 |  Cisoco plays it past De Jong and he's away from him and Cisoco gives it to Lucas Moura,
[5752.20 - 5757.32] P:1872.30 E:0.099821 |  right side of the area, it's pulled back and it's cut out by Sinkgraven who is arriving back,
[5758.04 - 5763.80] P:1789.74 E:0.100530 |  Tottenham, the offside flag is up, it was played towards the halfway line but Fatongan got there
[5763.80 - 5769.56] P:1823.52 E:0.105578 |  first. Once again it's the powerhouse Cisoco driving from midfield, Rolises Moura right
[5769.56 - 5774.52] P:1740.39 E:0.091012 |  hand side of the box, I was wondering is it an angle whether he could have got a shot off,
[5774.52 - 5780.68] P:1733.11 E:0.089450 |  decided to pull it back, Sinkgraven, right place, right time to clear the ball.
[5782.28 - 5791.00] P:1818.15 E:0.093200 |  2-2 is the score here, it's BBC Radio 5 Live, 3-2 to Ajax on aggregate and we are now into the last
[5791.88 - 5800.12] P:1891.25 E:0.093004 |  15 minutes or at least we are now, he has Loris chipping the ball away, here to the left hand side,
[5800.12 - 5807.96] P:1829.20 E:0.097299 |  Rose takes it down, Reds your pochettino stalking around down there, ball intercepted by Masarawi,
[5807.96 - 5811.32] P:1885.33 E:0.116629 |  Rose was a little heavy with this challenge from behind on Z-Act, no free kick,
[5813.24 - 5817.24] P:2019.68 E:0.117820 |  most displeased by that, that looked like a handball by Danny Rose and it was and Rose
[5818.52 - 5823.48] P:2091.67 E:0.114329 |  bounces the ball into the pitch, bounces the ball at the referee actually and it bounces over his
[5823.48 - 5828.84] P:2057.64 E:0.101254 |  head and that's a yellow card for Danny Rose. It's just Dar from Danny Rose because it just
[5829.48 - 5834.76] P:1880.63 E:0.103334 |  allows Ajax to take the stink out of the game, Spurs in the ascendancy, it was a handball,
[5834.84 - 5840.52] P:1838.87 E:0.086116 |  you can't catch the ball Danny, but then he punches the ball, picks it up, punches it into the floor,
[5841.80 - 5848.36] P:1849.45 E:0.091699 |  just allows Ajax to try and regain a bit of composure. Here is Rose, now free kick from Delic,
[5848.36 - 5852.44] P:1969.86 E:0.092098 |  who has hit straight at him, Rose up towards Llorente, might have been hauled over there by
[5852.44 - 5857.56] P:1948.11 E:0.100348 |  Daley Blint, lovely from Sissoco to go past Daley Blint, Sissoco then very nearly
[5858.36 - 5863.72] P:1865.87 E:0.090679 |  passed Veltman to who just managed to get the touch, the substitute and now it's back with
[5863.72 - 5870.76] P:1824.48 E:0.088315 |  Onana who will clear, the time seems to be whizzing around for Tottenham, just feel the way the game
[5870.76 - 5880.76] P:1820.66 E:0.089442 |  is going, they will create at least one more chance, here is Christian Eriksen on his old home ground,
[5880.76 - 5885.48] P:1942.46 E:0.110552 |  oh Danny Rose is then taken out, cut the ball back, Ziek arrived, took a shins away, it's
[5885.48 - 5890.68] P:1907.04 E:0.107446 |  free kick and that's going to be a yellow card for Ziek, that's been some tussle,
[5892.84 - 5902.68] P:1825.38 E:0.087429 |  Ziek and Rose, it's clever from Rose, draws Ziek in, just chops back, left footed onto the ball,
[5902.68 - 5911.56] P:1758.30 E:0.083725 |  Ziek fouls him, but I tell you this stadium now is getting nervy, the pressure is on for Ajax,
[5912.28 - 5915.48] P:1867.58 E:0.091394 |  can they see it through, Spurs don't know when they beat,
[5915.96 - 5920.20] P:1877.80 E:0.092555 |  that's Chris Sutton with us on 5 live, so much Champions League experience, we've got Darren Fletcher
[5920.20 - 5925.48] P:1804.39 E:0.091206 |  alongside Mark Chapman back in the studio who played so many Champions League games with Manchester
[5925.48 - 5929.16] P:1732.58 E:0.099567 |  United, we'll have more from him at the end of this game, we'll try and get you the thoughts of
[5929.16 - 5935.40] P:1758.88 E:0.095376 |  Mauricio Pochettino as well and as I say Europa League commentary, Valencia Arsenal tomorrow
[5935.40 - 5941.08] P:1877.31 E:0.105028 |  night on 5 live, ball up towards Llorente, near the edge of the box Llorente is picked up for a foul
[5941.08 - 5947.56] P:1883.54 E:0.097373 |  on Blint, Llorente is a big guy, it's a lovely weighted diagonal ball into him and all he does
[5947.56 - 5954.36] P:1757.20 E:0.096495 |  is trying to hold his ground and he catches Blint with his right arm, I don't really see how that's
[5954.36 - 5964.60] P:1724.59 E:0.089578 |  about, he's allowed to fight for his space, again Anana taking his time, 2-2, 3-2 to Ajax
[5964.84 - 5969.48] P:1868.15 E:0.091718 |  on aggregate, have you enjoyed our commentaries this week, join us on Sunday as well for the last day
[5969.48 - 5976.04] P:1930.41 E:0.097850 |  of the Premier League, throwing two Tottenham rows up towards Gallialli, now here's Son on the left hand
[5976.04 - 5982.04] P:1758.35 E:0.087970 |  side, Son turns back towards the halfway line and gives it to Fatongan, on 5 live Sunday we will
[5982.04 - 5987.32] P:1856.48 E:0.095623 |  have commentary on Brighton Manchester City, on 5 live Sports Extra, Liverpool against Wolves,
[5987.32 - 5993.16] P:1843.10 E:0.099811 |  but the whole picture will be covered for you, here is Sissoko, Sissoko and then loses possession,
[5995.00 - 6002.92] P:1776.56 E:0.087947 |  and on the halfway line Tadic, Dusan Tadic, the 34 goal Tadic, gives the ball to Sinkgraven,
[6002.92 - 6007.88] P:1873.85 E:0.101719 |  now back to Vandabek who hits the shot, that's blocked by Fatongan on the edge of the area,
[6007.88 - 6014.04] P:1891.84 E:0.105533 |  Vandabek turns, gives it back to Sijek, left foot shot, hits the post and comes out and rows
[6014.04 - 6022.76] P:1858.59 E:0.095000 |  clears, so close to a third goal on the night for Ajax, oh rattle's off, Larissa's left hand post,
[6022.76 - 6028.68] P:1865.24 E:0.106060 |  is that the breaks Spurs need? Hit the post in the first leg through Neres, that was important,
[6029.32 - 6034.12] P:1836.80 E:0.107969 |  Zeeek there, his shot striking the upright and bouncing out and now Tottenham winning the ball
[6034.12 - 6039.32] P:1972.99 E:0.111725 |  back inside Ajax territory, but that's a foul by Lucas Mora, he wins the ball Lucas Mora,
[6040.28 - 6047.08] P:1816.49 E:0.104939 |  but these two teams are now just slugging it out, Ajax go forward, Spurs go forward.
[6047.16 - 6058.12] P:1665.29 E:0.101720 |  They are going at it, Hammer and Tong, Ajax with a free kick, 10 minutes to play,
[6058.76 - 6063.96] P:1725.57 E:0.100770 |  I think some more Tottenham fans are actually, are they being moved out to down to the left?
[6063.96 - 6066.60] P:1729.32 E:0.099131 |  It's a beer fest isn't it, just beer everywhere.
[6067.56 - 6073.24] P:1759.14 E:0.091726 |  Cisoco back towards Ericsson, Ericsson goes for a high long ball, Delict is under that,
[6073.24 - 6076.68] P:1775.37 E:0.099850 |  heads it out here to the right hand side, Veltman has cleared it straight to Ericsson,
[6076.68 - 6080.28] P:1803.48 E:0.103762 |  Ericsson now into the path of Deli Alias stretch, but Veltman got in there first,
[6080.28 - 6084.84] P:1883.11 E:0.102472 |  wins it back inside his own half, he has Van Der Big, his pass to Zeeek, what a brilliant
[6084.84 - 6089.56] P:1920.56 E:0.096977 |  touch from Zeeek, running up for Tongan now, Zeeek back to Tadditch, for Tongan, excellent
[6089.56 - 6095.16] P:1813.80 E:0.103325 |  challenge. What a challenge from Tongan, great driving run from Zeeek, out of the right hand side,
[6095.16 - 6101.32] P:1965.86 E:0.114922 |  releases Tadditch for Tongan, had to get that right. Oh and then Zeeek is all over and hacks down
[6101.32 - 6109.32] P:2043.80 E:0.106582 |  Danny Rose, Zeeek has just been yellow carded, Tottenham are going to make
[6111.48 - 6118.60] P:1890.29 E:0.099788 |  another change, Kieran Kripia is coming off and Eric Lamella is making his return from injury,
[6119.16 - 6124.68] P:1836.41 E:0.086113 |  Eric Lamella who's had quite a spell out with a hamstring problem, not played in the last 11
[6125.24 - 6131.08] P:1786.11 E:0.084877 |  matches, remember him scoring in the Champions League at Wembley against Barcelona, Eric Lamella,
[6131.40 - 6137.88] P:1841.74 E:0.088295 |  where's he going Chris centrally, I think he is, yep he's going centrally, Mora
[6139.24 - 6141.64] P:1856.62 E:0.113657 |  has gone out to the right hand side,
[6144.12 - 6148.52] P:1753.70 E:0.094645 |  Laurenti on the edge of the area, heads it down, here's Lamella, into the action,
[6148.52 - 6153.56] P:1871.04 E:0.089288 |  straight into the action, gives the ball to Son, Son now, Lamella has made a run across the penalty
[6153.56 - 6161.00] P:1936.27 E:0.094251 |  area to the left hand side, Lamella, still Lamella, back it goes to Danny Rose,
[6162.12 - 6166.12] P:2160.03 E:0.113074 |  we're into the last 10 minutes now, Deli Ali lays it off to Lamella just outside the day,
[6166.12 - 6170.84] P:2069.96 E:0.097480 |  change of feet, Laurenti in the box, Laurenti back to Lamella, just intercepted by Daily Blint
[6170.84 - 6175.72] P:2018.98 E:0.111021 |  and cleared away, so close, that would have been a clear chance if he'd been able to thread it through,
[6175.80 - 6183.64] P:1932.87 E:0.106512 |  Ericsson's ball in, folly away by Daily Blint, leaning back and Ajax are creaking here,
[6184.76 - 6188.76] P:2017.40 E:0.106740 |  well he's using all his experience there, Daily Blint, two crucial interceptions,
[6188.76 - 6194.20] P:1947.67 E:0.096011 |  Cisoco's gone to right back, four spurs, Ben Davis is going to come on next,
[6194.20 - 6198.28] P:1939.21 E:0.101557 |  Mauricio Pochettino has his arm around the Welshman on the edge of the coaching area,
[6199.00 - 6205.08] P:2028.34 E:0.107891 |  Ajax, Taddage, high foot from Taddage, that's a free kick, they don't like that, either inside the
[6205.16 - 6210.36] P:2067.28 E:0.109485 |  arena, and Tottenham wanted to take the free kick quickly, but it's Danny Rose who's coming off,
[6210.92 - 6216.04] P:2030.03 E:0.107396 |  perhaps mindful of the fact that Rose and Ziak are in a right tussle here and both of them are on a yellow card,
[6217.72 - 6225.24] P:1900.48 E:0.087318 |  and fresh legs, Davy slotting in, that left back, what is it, how many minutes, eight minutes
[6225.24 - 6229.72] P:1892.20 E:0.093519 |  for Spurs to get something that's unbearable, the tension in this stadium,
[6230.68 - 6237.56] P:1878.21 E:0.088456 |  Son on the left hand side, Tempers are just raised to our left here, Ajax fan actually with a
[6237.56 - 6245.64] P:1916.48 E:0.096616 |  steward who are exchanging views, it's like that, Tempers' tension is high,
[6247.72 - 6254.76] P:2054.79 E:0.105835 |  Alderviro to Cisoco, who as Chris Sutton says is taken over right back or at least on the right side,
[6254.76 - 6265.80] P:1929.31 E:0.107195 |  Alderviro, Costa for Tongan, we're in the 83rd minute here in Amsterdam, Tottenham must score
[6265.80 - 6271.08] P:1879.87 E:0.096290 |  and not concede, and they'll be through to the final, right now it is Ajax going through,
[6271.96 - 6276.76] P:1977.26 E:0.102897 |  but St Graven has lost the ball, Lucas Moore into the box, Lucas Moore is deflected back to
[6276.76 - 6282.44] P:1925.43 E:0.096933 |  Llorente, Llorente on to his left foot, he's crowded out and Vanderbake will pass it away,
[6282.44 - 6286.44] P:1863.75 E:0.110639 |  it's seen for all the world, it was about to open up for Spurs and then a foul,
[6289.00 - 6295.40] P:1886.64 E:0.101730 |  Davy's wins the ball, I'll tell you what Llorente, what an impact he's made, just can't quite
[6295.40 - 6301.64] P:1793.65 E:0.105071 |  get the shot off, crucial interception from St Graven, Ziek, I think Davy's
[6302.36 - 6308.44] P:1845.71 E:0.108465 |  pinches the ball off him, he goes down Ziek, Jarente's made life really tough for daily Blint,
[6309.40 - 6313.80] P:1860.72 E:0.103277 |  he has the smart move peeling on Blint, you can't cope with his physicality,
[6315.00 - 6321.32] P:1779.06 E:0.091094 |  but at the moment is Ajax who are going through, but we have had well at halftime it was three
[6321.32 - 6327.00] P:1805.86 E:0.090611 |  nil on aggregate, we weren't expecting this, great credit to Tottenham, two goals from Lucas Moore,
[6327.00 - 6330.84] P:1932.29 E:0.093294 |  the first Tottenham player to score in a European semi-final, since Mickey Hazard,
[6331.80 - 6338.28] P:1839.42 E:0.093594 |  Davis heads the ball away to Song, Veltman is all over Song, that's a free kick,
[6338.28 - 6343.40] P:1993.71 E:0.108928 |  they're howling again in the stands and Frankie De Jong runs towards referee,
[6343.40 - 6348.20] P:1959.35 E:0.101048 |  break, just feel they're losing a little bit of composure Ajax here, yep,
[6348.92 - 6354.92] P:1937.16 E:0.102279 |  seen him like that, De Jong animated, they know what's at stake here, both teams do,
[6355.00 - 6361.00] P:1793.19 E:0.097655 |  Tongan goes long, Jarente again up against Blint, chest sits down, bounces away and Ajax are able
[6361.00 - 6366.44] P:1832.82 E:0.087781 |  to clear, Vanderbake now, as Ajax looked the breakaways, Crossfield pass was deflected,
[6366.44 - 6371.56] P:1871.84 E:0.100446 |  Ziek who's a real danger man, scored one, hit the post with another that would have finished it,
[6371.56 - 6377.88] P:1825.52 E:0.099049 |  surely, Ziek again, one-twos, now Talia Fico is going to get involved, the left back is marauding
[6377.88 - 6382.92] P:1898.32 E:0.091302 |  forward, gives it to St Graven on the left hand side, St Graven, Ziek is there, corner of the box,
[6382.92 - 6387.88] P:1956.41 E:0.111708 |  Ziek across the edge of the penalty area, that was quite a heavy challenge by Alderviral on the
[6387.88 - 6392.52] P:1954.15 E:0.107387 |  left back, Talia Fico is now out of the game, no free kick, Tottenham bringing it forward,
[6392.52 - 6397.64] P:1977.88 E:0.090347 |  they're bringing it forward down the left hand side, we have just five minutes to play,
[6397.64 - 6404.04] P:1944.62 E:0.096971 |  plus added time, great Champions League drama here on Five Live in Amsterdam,
[6404.04 - 6411.40] P:1862.11 E:0.104005 |  Shasoko on the right, back it goes, near the halfway line to Alderviral, now Ericsson, Ericsson,
[6412.12 - 6417.72] P:1828.39 E:0.101061 |  composure from Tottenham here, Alderviral receives it, shuffles forward, gives it to
[6417.72 - 6422.52] P:1964.36 E:0.101330 |  Shasoko on the right hand side, Shasoko's ball hitting, does reach Son, Son in the box on the
[6422.52 - 6428.28] P:1997.53 E:0.095520 |  right, Son shoots, outstretched foot of Talia Fico deflects it wider than the opposed, corner again
[6428.28 - 6433.16] P:1835.39 E:0.099506 |  to Tottenham, yes good from Son inside the box, she's trying to create an angle on the right hand
[6433.16 - 6439.64] P:1731.17 E:0.099188 |  side and fire across in another corner to Spurs and they've looked at threat from set pieces now,
[6439.72 - 6446.44] P:1755.40 E:0.099522 |  Laurenti's on, ball about the delivery, remember the corner at the Etihad, the controversial goal
[6446.44 - 6452.84] P:1819.82 E:0.091867 |  that was scored by Laurenti, let's keep our eyes on him, he's near the penalty spot at the moment,
[6452.84 - 6457.08] P:1938.31 E:0.106917 |  Lamella with the delivery this time, Ericsson with the delivery, here it goes, Laurenti gets
[6457.08 - 6461.96] P:1955.62 E:0.107784 |  his head to it, it's headed against the crossbar by Fertogun, it bounces down, Fertogun can't
[6461.96 - 6467.08] P:1797.98 E:0.101817 |  force it over the line, now Tottenham have hit the frame of the goal, are they going to get a
[6467.08 - 6471.96] P:1923.86 E:0.105099 |  better chance than that Spurs, Lucas Moura high ball into the box, O'Nanna's come with a punch,
[6471.96 - 6477.08] P:1922.12 E:0.093857 |  he's punched it straight to Lamella, he gives it back to Ericsson, Ericsson less than five minutes
[6477.08 - 6483.08] P:1904.45 E:0.093993 |  to go, Fertogun just hit the crossbar, still Ericsson finds a little space to give it to
[6483.08 - 6488.20] P:1921.59 E:0.099893 |  Lamella, Lamella edge of the D, rolls it across to the left hand side to Son, Son now inside the
[6488.20 - 6494.68] P:1912.39 E:0.102623 |  box, the crowded box, Son shoots from the angle, high over the angle of post and bar, goal kick,
[6494.68 - 6499.00] P:1876.77 E:0.106844 |  the angles against Son, little step over, then the right hand side, sales feltment,
[6499.72 - 6506.92] P:1763.69 E:0.115311 |  narrow angle and it goes over but the chance was from Fertogun, he's got the score, he hits the
[6506.92 - 6512.28] P:1685.51 E:0.116548 |  bar, he's four yards out, it's a coming together Laurenti, I think it's the leg that the ball just
[6512.28 - 6520.60] P:1765.15 E:0.093515 |  floats, it hangs in the air and Fertogun, that was the chance for Spurs needed. Just seeing a flash
[6520.60 - 6528.92] P:1778.96 E:0.092267 |  up on the board, Tottenham had 20 attempts at goal to Ajax's 13 but are they going to get a better
[6528.92 - 6538.12] P:1786.55 E:0.102358 |  chance than that one? We're in the 88th minute here, Ajax 2, Tottenham 2, 3-2 to Ajax on aggregate,
[6538.76 - 6545.96] P:1683.22 E:0.094001 |  Onanna with a goal kick, Deli Ali heads it forward, Dalia Fico out there, Lucas Moura,
[6545.96 - 6550.04] P:1906.06 E:0.111093 |  caught Lucas Moura on the follow through, the ball bounces on the halfway line, Deli Ali's been fouled,
[6551.56 - 6560.60] P:1906.40 E:0.096868 |  87.5 minutes played, free kick, Ericsson trots across to take base, huge huge moment,
[6561.72 - 6567.56] P:1836.67 E:0.102882 |  a place and the Champions League final is at stake here in the next few minutes, do not go anywhere,
[6568.68 - 6574.76] P:1707.96 E:0.099133 |  it's Ajax's at the moment, Ajax Liverpool, one goal for Tottenham without reply, it would be Tottenham
[6575.48 - 6581.96] P:1791.28 E:0.092986 |  Liverpool in Madrid, Ericsson across to Davis, Davis takes it on, floats the ball in, that's headed
[6581.96 - 6589.00] P:1820.28 E:0.092959 |  across the box by De Jong for Ajax and then Vanda Beg just dumps it high into the centre circle,
[6589.00 - 6593.80] P:1839.95 E:0.106149 |  oh Ericsson gets a touch and he steered it out of play for a throw to Ajax down the left hand side,
[6593.80 - 6600.52] P:1817.01 E:0.094063 |  that's a break, that gives them a break, they're waiting to make a change as well, Ajax, which will
[6600.52 - 6611.24] P:1784.64 E:0.098850 |  be their second change, I think it is, and it's Magashan who's coming on the Argentine central
[6611.24 - 6619.56] P:1781.47 E:0.097814 |  defender, throwing for Ajax, Frankie De Jong is going to take it down towards the corner flag,
[6619.56 - 6626.12] P:1843.10 E:0.089714 |  Tottenham have got it back, Alderviral, 88.75 minutes played, the bounce is out of play for
[6626.12 - 6635.40] P:1893.13 E:0.105169 |  throwing to Tottenham inside their own heart, here's the substitution then, Vanda Beg
[6636.92 - 6648.28] P:1972.56 E:0.096727 |  is sacrificed to bring on Magashan, Lisandro Magashan, who whether he goes into central midfield
[6648.28 - 6652.60] P:1949.43 E:0.102796 |  or whether he takes a place at the back, let's just see, to throw in to Tottenham,
[6653.56 - 6658.68] P:1911.52 E:0.099898 |  Cisoco is waiting to take it, I think they're trying to get a bit of physical presence on
[6658.68 - 6665.24] P:1935.48 E:0.095261 |  Magashan, Spurs have been quite direct, Vanda Beg has still got ten yards to get off the pitch
[6667.72 - 6671.40] P:1927.33 E:0.100973 |  and eventually on he comes, looks as though he's going to take his place in the back line
[6673.40 - 6679.48] P:1933.10 E:0.091409 |  and in fact Daily Blint is being moved forward into midfield and Magashan at the back, here it is
[6680.04 - 6686.52] P:1928.45 E:0.097752 |  forward, 89 minutes and 45 seconds, see how long there will be added on, Tottenham must score to
[6686.52 - 6692.04] P:1902.27 E:0.087991 |  get into the Champions League final, Ajax are going through, five minutes of added time,
[6693.80 - 6699.32] P:1898.10 E:0.096962 |  Ericsson back to the halfway line, Gronz as everyone sees, five minutes go up on the big
[6699.32 - 6703.32] P:1916.88 E:0.098301 |  screens, Fertonga forward to the edge of the area, Lucas Moura wins the header,
[6703.32 - 6707.64] P:1850.43 E:0.098284 |  Caliopico allowed it to bounce, Calioli was almost onto it, he was cleared away and now
[6708.20 - 6714.52] P:1972.27 E:0.100868 |  Lamello has lost possession, Ajax played forward towards Tadic, Tadic up against Fertonga, takes it

[6719.16 - 6725.16] P:1960.70 E:0.097037 |  it behind, corner Ajax. It was good for Mike, it's a lovely weighted pass from De Jong,
[6726.12 - 6731.88] P:1910.69 E:0.094712 |  the centre of the park releases Tadic, De Jong carries on his run and Tadic releases him right
[6731.96 - 6738.20] P:1833.87 E:0.096479 |  to the side of the box for Tongan, gets back, Ajax are going to take the time with this corner,
[6738.20 - 6746.52] P:1933.58 E:0.101535 |  keep the ball in Tottenham's half. In actual fact they don't have anyone in the penalty area,
[6746.52 - 6753.96] P:1876.07 E:0.100235 |  Ajax, they have a corner and everyone stayed back, Bar, the corner taker, Ziak and Tadic
[6753.96 - 6759.32] P:1943.44 E:0.092980 |  is going across to take it short and he's miscontrolled it, he was trying to shield it
[6759.32 - 6763.64] P:1834.55 E:0.091145 |  from Eriksson, he's miscontrolled it straight out of play, we've already had one minute of the
[6763.64 - 6770.76] P:1840.70 E:0.091629 |  five minutes of added time, Tottenham must score, otherwise they're out in the semi-final.

[6784.68 - 6789.48] P:1857.85 E:0.103648 |  Ajax territory, Eriksson plays it across towards Alderviro, Alderviro's going to go for the
[6789.48 - 6794.44] P:1930.30 E:0.112160 |  long ball, there's no one on the left wing, he's past it straight out of play and he screams
[6795.08 - 6801.00] P:1926.29 E:0.108355 |  at Ben Davis for not being there. That's wasteful, Alderviro, there's still time for Spurs,
[6801.96 - 6808.04] P:1878.24 E:0.107601 |  there is time, Ajax trying to kill the game, no rush for Ajax, can they see it through?
[6808.68 - 6821.64] P:1825.58 E:0.098266 |  Throwing is going to be taken by Veltman, the noise here is intense, the atmosphere is just
[6821.64 - 6829.32] P:1864.66 E:0.095858 |  tense, Veltman with a throw, Ziak back to Mazraoui, spotted the run through the middle,

[6848.36 - 6851.80] P:1849.52 E:0.108162 |  It's a big save down to his left hand side, brilliant strike from Ziak,
[6853.00 - 6859.64] P:1739.46 E:0.100214 |  Spurs quick punt up the pitch, comes back at Tottenham now, Alderviro is under it for Tongan,

[6901.72 - 6906.84] P:1941.28 E:0.099330 |  on the right, back to Ericsson, he's shot blocked behind, corner. Daily Blindu gets the block and
[6906.84 - 6911.64] P:1857.34 E:0.103458 |  really well worked from Spurs, quick one two right down side of the box, Ericsson, you can't let him
[6911.64 - 6915.80] P:1845.46 E:0.100930 |  shoot from there, Daily Blindu all over and this is it, this must be the last chance,
[6916.92 - 6922.52] P:1870.49 E:0.103184 |  Loris has come up, the goalkeeper's coming up, this is it, this is the chance, this is Spurs'
[6922.52 - 6928.04] P:1918.39 E:0.097290 |  chance from the corner, Ericsson, high towards the penalty spot, you're edging with the header over,
[6928.04 - 6933.96] P:1933.74 E:0.103759 |  high and over, in between two Ajax men, we have played four minutes of added time
[6934.68 - 6939.24] P:1863.08 E:0.109241 |  and it's a goal kick and Ajax are 60 seconds away.
[6940.84 - 6946.44] P:1822.27 E:0.111195 |  As Loris goes forward it's an out-swinger from Ericsson, it actually looked at one
[6946.44 - 6952.20] P:1799.23 E:0.107800 |  stage like Loris may get on the end of it but Llorente got up, just couldn't direct the header
[6952.20 - 6958.52] P:1791.28 E:0.105955 |  on target. And Ana says the ball that he's been given isn't the right ball and he's thrown it away
[6959.32 - 6963.72] P:1887.37 E:0.107514 |  Is that it again? The ball boy's given him another ball, he's been yellow carded,

[6968.92 - 6975.48] P:1840.74 E:0.096503 |  and it's a goal kick so referee break has to add on another minute, surely.

[7043.00 - 7048.68] P:1707.05 E:0.104504 |  it is extraordinary, I've never seen anything like it, I really haven't,
[7049.88 - 7054.68] P:1753.80 E:0.110998 |  Spurs have been gallant, they've been bold, the rentes caused problems, just a lovely touch
[7054.68 - 7060.92] P:1798.26 E:0.102131 |  from deli Ali, a death touch outside of the right foot, Moura's got so much to do, still left footed,
[7061.40 - 7068.44] P:1721.69 E:0.106484 |  precision into the far corner, unbelievable from Spurs, they just don't know when they're beat,

[7128.60 - 7135.32] P:1790.21 E:0.101094 |  off the pitch by Masrawi, throw in, there will be time to take this, I think referee Brick was
[7135.32 - 7140.76] P:1881.49 E:0.101525 |  telling Ajax how long he was going to play, you know, well virtually everybody in the box, Veltman
