 Concern for the national icon of Brazil, but he'll be watching from his hospital bed and he'll be hoping to see Brazil make their way through into the last eights for a date on Friday afternoon against Croatia who knocked out Japan, albeit on a penalty shootout, 3-1 in that shootout after it finished 1-1 after extra time. So we're underway, you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live, you can also find us on the BBC Sounds app as well, if you haven't done so already. It's no doubt will have been heavily cloaked throughout this tournament so far as they look for an early ball through to try and get Richalice in a way, but it was sent out to this near side for Kim Jin-soo, the left back for South Korea all in red playing from right to left as we look, ball forward to Sasson and then the flag is up and it's offside. The referee tonight is Clemente Terpain from France, one of the more experienced officials. Jerome Brassard is his compatriot who's in charge of the VAR and whilst only the Califa International Stadium has seen more goals, 28-7 so far at this tournament, Stadium 9-7-4 is second on that list with 16-6, but these two sides do not have a track record of scoring goals in a first half. For South Korea, 11 of their last 12 goals in a World Cup have been scored after the break and Brazil have failed to score in the first half of any of their last five World Cup games. You're looking at that negatively, aren't you? I'm looking at it like both sides are due. I'm thinking Curse of the Commentator, we could have a six-goal thriller and it's 3-3 going in by the time we hand back to Marc Chapman with our world hold of the break. This near side with Rafinha, they go back, Marquinhos plays a square ball out to Militão at right back, back to Alisson very much established as the Brazilian number one despite the competition of Manchester City's Edison, the undisputed number one Alisson really. This is his 60th cap tonight as Rich Alisson looking towards Neymar and he's kept 40 clean sheets in 59 appearances which is mightily impressive. On this near side for South Korea is Kim Jin-soo who hits it early, Son makes the run, keeps the ball in play, top them play at level of the penalty area but Rafinha comes back to help out and there is Militão and Casamiro and now they can open it up for Brazil and Neymar quickly out towards Vinicius Junior, far side to left. Ball with the diagonal one inside, laid off by Rich Alisson, the return ball from Neymar to Rich Alisson was cut out there by Kim Young-guam. Yes, the heart of that South Korea, Rich Alisson just popped that off, it was just behind Neymar, couldn't release the ball back to Rich Alisson but Brazil have set up as we expected, that back four, Casamiro sitting in front of that back four, Neymar and Pequeta playing Hyabin midfield, Vinicius Junior off the left and Rafinha off the right, Rich Alisson, central striker. Rafinha just passed the ball straight out of play, almost his left shoulder, rolled down his chest, hit it first time left put into Pequeta and it runs out of play for a goal kick. This is the first temporary venue in World Cup history and as a result naturally there isn't any air conditioning inside this stadium for what feels like a really muggy night. Yes, it does feel quite close, I hope you put your deodorant on. Here at the back is Kim Menje, out it goes now to this near side and volleyed forward, Solskjaer's the willing runner starting from a central position up against Marquinhos, Militão back into position and again the flag goes up, second time offside for South Korea, nearly five minutes played and it's Brazil nil, South Korea nil. It looks like South Korea have shaped up as a four, three, three, Sol will make those movements in behind. Vinicius Jr, left hand side, back to Neymar. Now the ball goes square, Militão, Jonathan Attac leaves it for Casamiro out towards Rafinha, Kim Jin-soo with interception, South Korea will get a throw. Have you not heard, I brought an array of different shirts with me. Oh I did hear that, yeah. How many shirts in total? Shelds prepare for a fair to fail, Christopher. Five minutes played, the Brazilian supporters inside this stadium are the ones trying to generate the noise, South Korea in possession, Kim Jin-soo, back to Kim Yun-guant and now Kim Menje over on that far side, mightily impressive since he's arrived from Napoli from the top, he's the chief for 16 million pounds, he was the replacement for Cule Valley who of course moved to Chelsea. Ball is hit long now by Kim Yun-guant, but up in the air it goes, headed back forward, off the chest by Militão, Militão the Brazilian right back gives it away, referee, French referee gives it free kick and again South Korea, free kick to Brazil nil nil, six minutes left, it's a bit of a soft award for free kick there, Militão trying to get away from Cho and too much contact Brazil in the free kick, but I mentioned earlier, we won't see when you think about Brazil, you think about full backs who fly forward, overlaps, whipping balls in from the violin, but that's not the case with this Brazilian team and then the bonuses on the wide players, Raphinha, Vinicius Jr in those 1v1 duels to make something happen and Neymar who just come and collected the ball, popped it back to Thiago Silva for him to get into those little spaces and make something happen. What I have noticed already though is that Danilo who's playing as a left back is almost at the minute playing in a very central midfield area, he's completely vacated his left back slot as Raphinha into the penalty area with the cutback comes to Vinicius Jr, time to place his shots and time to find the back of the net, forget about waiting to the second half, Vinicius Jr has taken seven minutes and the tournament favourites lead by a goal to Neal. What a finish, what a cool customer Vinicius Jr was then, they work it really well down the right hand side through Brazil and as the ball is crossed in it evades everybody all the way through to be on the far post and I think everybody in the stadium is thinking Vinicius Jr is going to hit this first time, he doesn't, he composes himself, takes a touch and lifts the ball into the far side netting, it's a brilliant finish. Vinicius Jr is this young super star, it really is. It was Raphinha with the trickery down the right hand side and Vinicius Jr with only his second goal for Brazil, his first was against Chile in the final qualifier, he's just backed his first goal in a World Cup. It was persistent wasn't it from Raphinha down the right hand side but this is an incredible finish, as cool as you like, just lifts the ball over the out rushing goal kick with his four Korean defenders who are trying to block the ball but he picks his spot perfectly. No, sounds great, have work to do. A composed finish, just waited for the ball to settle, with Charleston to Raphinha. The dance celebration wasn't too bad either from Brazil who are leading by a goal to Nil, Militão on this near side. Oh, Paccatar, lovely ball inside, the reverse look, Casamiro, Neymar. Imagine that some 7,000 miles away that goal will have Pelle smiling, Brazil a 1-0 up. And what was it that Paulo Bento had said ahead of the game against Portugal that we need a miracle to win ahead of Portugal? Certainly they'll be looking now for a second miracle, well that's just got so much harder after conceding so early on. Because the thing is about this Brazilian side, we talk about the attack and the attack and the attack but they very rarely, they don't tend to concede too many, you look back at their record in qualifying, two clean sheets in the group stages already and now they have a free kick leading by a goal to Nil. Neymar rolls it, Paccatar with a little layup, Song clears for South Korea. I don't think you're mentioning the clean sheets, I don't think Alisson, he played the first two games, had a shot to save in those first two games. Two little games, Serbia, one little against Switzerland, Kim Min Jae heads it away, Neymar picks it up on that far side, Neymar looking to try and jink his way in, D'Nillo's playing as a midfielder more than anything else, he's certainly not at left back every time, oh that's the penalty, that's the penalty, that was a rash challenge. And no hesitation from the French referee, Clemente Panre, Charleston brought down, he was just too quick, just too sharp. It looked like a clumsy challenge. Kim Min Jae at the challenge. They just unfurled the banner actually away towards our left, it said Telet get well soon, they're over the head to the brilliant supporters, away towards our left hand side, but our eyes are trained towards the right, because this is Raphinha with an opportunity, oh no, he had the ball but he's handed it to Neymar. He scored two penalties in the friendly game against South Korea, back in June I think, Neymar. His last five goals for Brazil have all been penalties, October the 21st against Uruguay was the last time he scored in open play, this will take him once, goal closer to Pelle. We've seen Messi, we've seen Mbappe, another of the world's superstars waits to get in on the ax, as Kim Sun Kyu waits on his goal line in his lavender goalkeeping outfit. Brazil lead already by a goal to nil, we've been playing for 12 minutes. Six goals in 11 appearances in his World Cup career so far, the keeper is standing so far to his right, he goes back to the centre, stuttering run up and Neymar rolls it in. Neymar's first goal of this World Cup, he joins the scoring charts and Brazil increase their lead. It's Brazil 2, South Korean nil. Yep, the green goalkeeper, the Brazilian players away dancing in the corner, trying to put Neymar off, Neymar wasn't having any of it, really slow composed run up, watching the goalkeeper all the way and then he just rolls the ball into the corner to keep his left hand side. This is the Brazil first team, unlike the team which was set up against Cameroon, but this is the perfect start and the perfect penalty from Neymar. They've got their main man back, Brazil. He just rolled it in right footed, the keeper stayed quite central, just dropping to his knees in frustration. Well he just sees him go to his right doesn't he, he just stalls a little bit, that final step, keeper goes to his right, we know where the ball went. And Neymar now moves to within one of Pele, his 76th goal in his 123rd appearance, Pele's record was 77 goals in 92. Another goal, he would equal Pele, he would also move into the top 10, as far as the goal scoring charts in men's international football is concerned as well. But if you think Croatia had to do it the hard way, forced to go through extra time and then a penalty shootout, Brazil look already well set for a place in the last eight leading 2-0. Challenge on show, the forward, quickly back to his feet. Now with Kim Jin-soo, ball played forward by Sun Yu-young, out towards the far side, Kim Moon-Hwan joins the attack, the ball is played forward ahead of him. And it's the Brazilian supporters who are waving their flags and standing up behind the goal where South Korea are attacking. It's a long way back already as we've only been playing for a quarter of an hour Chris Sun. Yeah, well they know what they have to do now. That game plan of sitting back, being difficult to beat, difficult to play through. I mean at 1-0 you think, well, you may stick with it, understandably so, but when Neymar tucks the second one in, it's just going to go for broke, haven't they? With nearly 15 minutes into this game, it's looking like a tall, tall, tall order in South Korea. I would think that Paulo Bento, the ex-Portugal boss who's in charge of South Korea, may be sitting rather uncomfortably down below. Because when they lost to Brazil in June by five goals to one, that was actually his heaviest defeat as the South Korean head coach. And already he finds himself 2-0 down here against Brazil. So coming forward now is Sun Yu-young, out to this near side, Bulboham to Wanderers, Hwang Hee-Chang. Ball played forward, comes back towards, Swang's going to shoot from distance. Not a bad effort either. Good 30 yards out from goal and tipped over well by Alisson, flying away to his left. Brazil lead 2-0. What a brilliant effort this is from. Wang drops his shoulder, Raphinha closes him down and it's all of 30 yards. That's dipping into the top corner. Brilliant hand by Alisson. From the corner kick on the right hand side, Hwang in bomb, lets one fly as well but lacks the accuracy of Hwang on this occasion and it's over the top. Couldn't quite find his range, goal kick, BBC Radio 5 live, Brazil lead by 2 goals to nil. Just seeing that effort again from Hwang Hee-Chang. I mean that's a brilliant, brilliant strike and Alisson gets those feet moving, leaps, launches himself up, tips the ball over the bar. Had that gone in it's a goal that any Brazilian would have been proud to have scored. Certainly would have constituted one of the best goals of the tournament so far I would imagine. Nearly 18 minutes played. Brazil lead by 2 goals for nil. Stadium 9-7-4 here on BBC Radio 5 live as that's the header away by Kim Jin-Sook. Militao to Raphinha over the halfway line, Brazil playing from left to right, yellow shirt, blue shorts, pacotar back towards Marquinhos. Marquinhos forward to Casamiro. Layed out towards Danilo, the return ball for Casamiro to run forward. Out now it goes once more and now Neymar takes over on the halfway line. And Neymar looking to go on the outside of his first challenge, plays it to Vinicius Jr. Vinicius Jr. Caught a little bit late and referee doesn't signal that he's played the advantage. This is a firm challenge Kim is on on Neymar and then Son trying to run forward but just quickly crowded out by the yellow shirts on the halfway line and it's back with Alice. And it's steely those Brazilian defenders that back four stays in tax, they pop the ball out wide and inside to Neymar, pacotar. The real ball players let them do their thing. Now it's with Thiago Silva. Danilo again is ahead of him, here he is over the halfway line inside to Casamiro, quickly releases the ball to Neymar, triangular passing patterns from Brazil and now with Marquinhos. Over the halfway line he accelerates and waiting his pacotar, played two feet behind him, the wait is left, goes out of play for a throw. Tomorrow is the final set of matches in the last 16, Morocco, Spain from 3 o'clock, Vicky Sparks and Pat Nevin, Portugal, Switzerland from 7 o'clock, Alistair Bruce Ball and Rob Green. And then on Wednesday the first day without any football whatsoever on BBC Radio 5 Live after 17 days of consecutive action. But don't forget in the morning, Rick Edwards out here live in Doha, 6 o'clock 5 Live breakfast, Rick and Rachel every morning on BBC Radio 5 Live. South Korea trail by Tugolsternil, ball just lifted forward by Neymar, Venetius Jr. Challenge comes in, runs away, Casamiro will try and get there first. That was well played by South Korea and it out goes to the right hand side, they've got an opportunity here to run forward. With joining the attack now on this near side, the left there's a man over in Hwang Hinh-Bam but they've lost the ball, that was Hwang. And then at the back is Kim Young-Won, South Korea all in red, Havoc Wonsmall and it's Kim Young-Won who plays the ball out towards the far side. And the right back now will run forward level with the penalty area. Right first at Ali, started all three games, there's Kim Young-Won, South Korea seeing a lot of the ball now but they're trading by two goals to Nil. Kim Young-Won out to this near side for Hwang, ahead of him is Kim Jin-Soo, they're at the left back but he's over run it and it's a goal kick. Brazil still lead by 2-0. Kim Jin-Soo just down that left hand side trying to get the better of Militar but he's comfortable out in that right back position. Preferred position, sent a half of course but there's a good job there for Brazil. The issue that South Korea have is throw bodies forward, try and get back into this game but you just feel they are going to be so, so vulnerable to Brazil when they do. Win the ball back. Behind that goal of Alisson, it's resembling a Brazilian mosh pit with the Brazilian supporters all jumping up and down. I hope that they've got their deodorant on Chris. 22 minutes play. Here is Kasamiro able to turn, diagonal ball, Pakatar runs through his legs, runs through to Rafinha. On this near side the right, over the half way line, South Korea have got 7 red shirts behind the ball, Pakatar now to the right back Militar. He doesn't venture forward. Danilo is inverted from his left back roll but Militar essentially stays quite square with the centre backs. You don't really see Danilo get on beyond Vinicius Jr. Try and get little overloads in the centre of the park. Kasamiro as we've seen over the years just plonks himself in front of that back four, breaking the play up, getting the screens on. Cho lays it off to Hwang. Cho will tussle with the ball, the back heel didn't quite come off, Militar there and then just lifted up and teed it away by himself by Kasamiro. Played back forward then by Sun Yu-yong and then on the half way line left footed Kim Young-guan lifts it and that was an acrobatic fall from Pakatar but he gets a free kick. For Brazil, we're midway through the first half on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Highlights tonight, BBC One, you'll be able to see the goals yourself of this game and 10-40 on BBC One tonight. You're really a stat about the lack of goals. Got a bit of egg on your face there, haven't you? Well you must be used to that with your predictions that never seem to come right. That's not strictly true is it? I did post on social media that there wouldn't be many goals, they have a history of not scoring in the first half and then I said Q, deluged your goals in the first half. There's a raking ball from Militar to Vinicius Jr who slips but still keeps the ball in play down by the corner flag on that left hand side. Pulls it back now and the cross curled in, punched away by Kim Sung-kyu and then collected by Militar out to Raphinha, waits on this right hand side. They've doubled up on Raphinha, he'll dart in between the two South Korean players but then it's played away up towards Sog and he is fouled and it will be a free kick. Raphinha very direct here, he gets the ball, likes to come inside on that left foot. Anthony of course getting his opportunity against Cameroon, he's a box of tricks but I think second fiddle to Raphinha. This is Lee Jae-soon, back now with the midfielder Hwang Eun-bong, near side is Hwang playing on this left hand side. Forward ahead of him is Kim Jin-soo, Kim Jin-soo will win a corner kick as he was closed down by Militar. So corner kick to South Korea who trailed 2-0. He had the opportunity there though Kim Jin-soo to whip an early crossing, decided to try and take Militar on. He's not got the better of him so far this evening. They got a goal from a corner didn't they against Portugal? Kim Yong-gwon. Yep, in the 2-1 victory in a dramatic fashion that it was. There's a corner kick that Song will take, Song in towards the near post headed out by Richalison for Brazil. In fact the nature of that goal for South Korea is a long range effort from Hwang is scooped up by Alisson. They actually qualified on goals scored with the nature of that 2-1 victory. The first team to do so since Paraguay, but in fact South Korea were one of the co-hosts back 20 years ago. 25 minutes play. Brazil lead 2-0, forward ball, couple of bounces through towards the goalkeeper Kim Sung-kyu. South Korea looking for a way back into the game. Two goals adrift. Far side the right, midway through the Brazil half. Played now back to Kim Min-jae gave away the penalty. This is Kim Yong-gwon, brings it forward over the halfway line. Pakatar approaches it, ball given away then by Kim Jinsu, but all of a sudden now they look vulnerable. And this is Neymar. And this is Neymar. Vanessa's junior streaking away to his left. Neymar will go it alone. Neymar on a diagonal trajectory running into the inside right channel. The penalty area was taken off his toes and he will win a corner kick for Brazil. And they've taken it quickly. Taking it short on the right hand side. Back towards Neymar. Goes central now to find Kasamira. Back now to Tiago Silva. Militant. Pakatar. Pakatar once more. Dinilo. Arquinhos has stayed forward at the moment. Ball given away by Vanessa's junior, but there isn't really the outlet to try and vacate the gap that has been left by Dinilo. And now it's with Wangin Bomb who will pass the ball forward towards that far side the right. And they've got Lee Jae-sun going ahead of them. That was a loose ball by Wangin Bomb and he's given it away straight towards Raphinha. Some of their ball retention has to be better. That's going to be an uncontested drop ball. No it isn't. The referee got in the way, but Neymar was able still to keep the ball. Turn. And now find Vanessa's junior who's attacking left hand side and will win a corner off the legs of Kim Moon-Hwan. Clever from Neymar the way he evaded the referee. He thought about not making him and then turned away from Cho. Pops of all that left. He just seems really comfortable at this moment in time for Brazil. Two nil up. Strutting their stuff. Corner kick far side the left. That's the familiar voice of Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live. Neymar to take the corner kick far side the left. South Korea have every red shirt backing in around their own penalty area. In it comes now and it's headed away by Kim Min Jae. Comes out then towards Raphinha. Plays it back out to Vanessa's junior. Scoops over the cross. Heading away once more by the Napoli defender. And now Brazil attack on this near side the right with Paketa. Down by the corner flag. Paketa the West Ham player rolls it back. Kissing Kasimira. He's got time to deliver the ball forward. Floated into the penalty area. Leaping header away by Kim Jung-Won. Three headers there from Rich Arleson. Melanches to get it to Makinos. Oh what a goal this could be. It's sensational. That is a sensational third goal. And it was finished off by Rich Arleson. As Brazil lead by 3 goals to nil. The interchange was so slick and the fitted into the left corner was just brilliant. From the build up play. You've turned it after watching that. Brazil 3 South Korean nil. Well this is Brazil and they're very very best. What a brilliant goal from Rich Arleson. A hat trick of headers wasn't it? Won the tussle. Popped it off and then quick combination play. This is what I think we expected to see earlier on in the competition. But their tails are up. And Rich Arleson. What a nurse is that? Over with Cheetay. He's too old to move like that isn't he? Well at 61 years of age I wouldn't necessarily say it was dad dancing. But Rich Arleson came across and actually performed a little bit of a dance routine with the substitutes. And there was even a bit of a wag of the shoulders there from Cheetay the coach. But it was Marquinhos. And the ball that was played forward towards Rich Arleson. But as you say a hat trick of headers. He was like a performing seal. A performing seal. Rich Arleson. Well he was a different smaker in their first game against Serbia with the goal of the tournament. Making his mark again this evening. This is going to get really ugly for South Korea. Ugly for South Korea. But for a football purist it's beautiful. And Brazil are looking to cut loose. Here is Raphinha. Raphinha shoots. Left footed couldn't keep it down from 25 yards out. Fractually left of centre. That is a goal that you will enjoy watching time and time again. He's persistent initially. Wins the headers. Plays it round the corner. Marquinhos. Pops the ball square. I think it was Casamiro. Who then made the pass for a charleson carries on his run. And then is composed as you like. The pass was perfected between two defenders. I've got to feel it was Thiago Silva. I've got to feel it. Whoever it was. It was quite a good pass wasn't it? More than quite a good pass. Waited perfectly and then takes his touch. And it's as easy as you like. His first touch perfect. It's easy to pick out the Brazilian supporters around stadium 974 now. Because to the beat of the drum they away from the bulk of yellow behind the goal where Alisson stands all in green. But in the bottom tier and the top tier of this two tiered bowl like stadium pockets of Brazilian supporters are just jumping up and down. Wang attacks. Left hand side. Good save by Alisson. Ties angle. Sprawling save it is near post. That's two saves that Alisson has made now. One from close range and the other from long range and both from Wang. Yes. Timing there. We've seen it so many times at Liverpool. The right time to come out and narrow an angle. And he does that to perfection. Brilliant play from Wang to drift pass. And a tear on that byline. He drives in. He's trying to feed the ball across for Alisson. His big frame comes sprawling out. Makes a save. It's impossible now though for Carrera isn't it? I mean it really is. Do they press high then? Brazilians play random. Once they get through the press, they're onto the back four. The first game as you may have heard on BBC Radio 5 Live went to extra time and penalties. There will be no such drama in this second game in the last six to eight. Will there be a miracle? No, no, no. I was in the cooking pot in Kazan with Ali Bruce Ball 2018 when South Korea beat Germany. They beat the Germans. Nobody expected that. I've got to say I feel like I'm in a cooking pot of my own here tonight. 12 minutes to go to half time. Brazil lead certainly turning up the heat on South Korea leading by three goals to nil with 12 minutes to go to the break. There's Marquinhos two at a Casamiro. Back to Marquinhos. Out to goes to Thiago Silva almost playing as a left back. Forward to Neymar. Takes it swiftly on the turn. Forward now to Vinicius Jr. Running in field. Vinicius Jr. To Paccatar with his back to goal. Plays it out to Raphinha. Inside right channel in the penalty area looking for a side of goal. Onto his left foot. Prod it back. Paccatar tees up Casamiro who shoots right footed and it's just pulled out wide for a goal kick. Brazil lead by three goals to nil. The goalie didn't hit the target then. The interesting Gite. Neymar coming back from the ankle injury. Half time. Three nil up. Probably already through. That's been Kotlin wall. Well it was said to me earlier today that you used to play cards with Didier Deschamps, the French coach during your time together at Chelsea. He used to play cards with me. Would you stick or twist here today if you were South Korea? Here is why. Challenge by Raphinha. Kim Jin-soo. I'll take him off. He's interesting. Tim Vickery. Ask him. He's their key man. An array of stars. He's their talisman. Everybody looks up to in the team. The difference maker made the difference in the first game when it was really quite tight. Drop of the shoulder on the edge of the box. Let the ball run across his body. Popped it out wide. Cross comes in. Richie Arneson. He puts them ahead. Did you send Didier a text today to him? Wishing congratulations for reaching the last eight. No, I'll do that tomorrow. Do that in the morning. Under 10 minutes to go to halftime and Brazil lead 3-0 against South Korea. Paketar, lovely form. And it's Richie Arneson now over the halfway line. Two to his left. One of them is Neymar. The other is Vinicius Jr. who now enters the penalty area on the left-hand side. Vinicius Jr. lifts the ball forward and it's finished off by Paketar and Brazil. He's right away with this. The break was electrifying. And Paketar with the fourth goal. Getting it on the edge. Brazil fall. South Korea nil. South Korea simply have no answer. It's game over. It's not a contest. The Brazil players in a huddle. Dancing up and down. Devastating. This is Brazil saying to the rest of the teams in the tournament, you've noticed this now. We're here. We're the favourites and this is why Neymar pops the ball out to the left-hand side. Vinicius Jr. scoops the ball over a couple of Korean defenders. Paketar right-footed, cushioned volley back across the goalkeeper. Really composed. It's all about the connection and just punches the ball into the far corner. Chite celebrates. Once again, he's made up. Brazil are made up. Career have finished. West Ham's record signing with his eighth goal for his country. His first in a World Cup. Key figure in qualifying with 14 appearances. And we could be on course for a record Brazil win here. The way that they're going, the Cunning South Korea open at will. Their World Cup record win was against Sweden in 1950. When they won by seven goals to one, it still had to go some for South Korea to suffer a record defeat at a World Cup, which was 9-0 also in the 50s against Hungary. But with seven minutes to go to half time, Brazil lead 4-0. The return ball breaks away from it. Kim Moon Won. Back it goes to the right back. Forward ball for a beleaguered South Korea trailing 4-0. But Brazil really are turning on the style. In fact, they may be wishing they didn't get through. This is utterly humiliating for them, isn't it? This is Brazil at their very best. It's nice, Korea getting a real lesson. But what do you do? I mean, they're trying to go forward. They're still trying to score a goal. Here is Son. Might shoot from distance. No, instead he looks towards Lee. Four play now to Kim Jin Soo. And on this near side, it's Wang Himbom. It's been our dick from distance. No, it's not. It's up towards Wang. Takes on into the penalty area, goes down the French referee after running into the back of Marquinhos. It is Clemente Pan who just tells the South Korea player, Wang, get back to his feet. In fact, he ran into the back of Militão. Oh, he's better than that. I knew that was coming. He's better than that. Wang is. He's actually looked quite sharp this evening, hasn't he? Yeah, he's had their best two efforts. And then pushes the ball past Militão and pushes it too far. Nose is not going to get it. So runs into Militão. Swept away by Alisson. Rich Alisson beaten in the air by Kim Yong Won. Out towards the far side. All the tricks are coming out now. That was just a lazy little flick and then a delightful little cushion touch there by Vinicius Jr. Neymar lets it run through. Rich Alisson is challenged. Well, the issue is the Brazilian players, you know, they're playing with that swagger now, aren't they? I mean, that was brilliant skill from Vinicius Jr. But often when players feel humiliated, the next one, they get booted up in the area. The style, the flair, the goals, the panache, you name it. Brazil are delivering it. Five minutes to go to half time on BBC Radio 5 Live. Remember being in the Belo Horizonte for what was a really dark day in Brazilian football when they were humiliated in 2014. Sprounced by Germany. Record defeat. Something that some of these players, Tiago Silva, were suspended that day. Part of the squad looking to try and put right. 20 years since they've last lifted the World Cup. Record type winners, of course, five occasions. And the favourites for this year's edition here in Qatar and certainly illustrating why on the evidence of the 41 minutes that we've witnessed so far. Favourites for you? And what I've seen so far, yes. Not the holders for Arsenal? Not impressed with England? England, I said to you yesterday, I said to you even before England played Senegal, that I was optimistic about England and that optimism remains. Here is Raphinha. As Somme is the player who has gone down to the referee, will Scott play? Taking a bloat to the head there, just taking his ass off. Got to, of course, be careful with that fractured eye socket, that's the reason why he's sporting the black mask, the Tottenham player. Well, there was a major concern he wasn't going to make that South Korean squad because of that injury. South Korea's most experienced and most important player, 30 years of age. But not able to find a goal so far in this competition for South Korea, who are trailing by four goals to nil as we approach half-time on BBC Radio 5 Live. Through the BBC Stounds app, if you've missed any of the goals, seven minutes for Nysius Junior, 13 minutes for Neymar, Richarlison just before the half-hour on 29, Lewis Packardtard 36. I think there might have been a ho-ho-ho from Richarlison's goal from Chris Sutton just before the half-hour. If you want to hear the jolly Chris Sutton on BBC Stounds, you can do that. You might even be able to, we're approaching Christmas time, it is allowed. Two minutes to go to half-time, but it does have that rewind facility as 4-0 for Brazil, a South Korea attack on the right-hand side. Dugout by Kim Moon-Hwan into the penalty area, headed out by Militau, picked up by Richarlison to Raphinha, midway through his own half, and he decides to run forward. There's a little step over, he's gone down holding his face as the challenge coming in from Sun Woo Young, and that will result in a yellow card, and even not that it's going to happen, but it's his second yellow of the tournament. So Sun Woo Young, the midfielder, is booked, and he would miss the next match, not that they're going to be going through. They'd have to pull off a dramatic 4-0 comeback, similar to what Newcastle did against Al Stull under Alan Pardue back in the day. What's the biggest world comeback? I mean, this is what you're paid to do, is there? It is, and I will endeavour to give you that answer if you want. I'd like it now. There are many stats and facts and figures that I've actually got. It's nearly half time, I suppose. It is, yeah. I want to phone a friend. If I've got a friend to phone. If I've got a friend to phone. I was just looking to my left to see who was looking over, but the fact that Mark Chapman didn't even look to his right would suggest that maybe I can't even rely on his help. Have I got anybody else? Ball played forward for South Korea, no challenge, no foul on show, and it runs through to Wartalus. So we'll talk about a half time, I'm sure, the brilliance of some of the Brazilian goals. But defensively, they are solid, aren't they? More than solid, street-wise. Here we go again, though. Here is Wartalusen. Wartalusen plays the square ball to Paketar, now towards Raphinha, edge of the area, back towards Paketar. Paketar hits it with his left foot, and it's saved by the keeper, and cleared away by South Korea. But he should have hit it with his right foot, and gone for power. It's a good save in the end, from Kim Sung-kyu. The ball slipped in, right hand side of the box. He lets it run across his body, and it's more or less a toe poke. The goalkeeper got down to his right hand side and saved. Paketar, cleared by Cho, up towards Son, and then Tiago's silver's ball runs away from him. If, of course, that, as we're into stoppage time, and additional time of five minutes, if, of course, that South Korea were to come back to draw 4-4, it would actually equal the highest scoring draw in World Cup history, which has actually been achieved twice. England, Belgium in 54, and the Soviet Union against Colombia in 62. However, Brazil are looking for a fifth goal, and they almost got it as well. Cross from Vinicius Jr. and entering the penalty area from Vinicius Jr. Cross was Raphinha, with an outstretch right leg inside the six yard area. Couldn't convert it, runs out of play, 4-0 Brazil. Why didn't he head it, Raphinha? Easiest of opportunities. Vinicius Jr. likes to come in on that right foot, doesn't he? He drives the outside, crosses the ball, brilliant cross across the six yard line. Two feet off the floor, Raphinha goes with his right foot, misses it completely. Did we get a bonus point for that stat about the highest scoring draw? Well recovered, 4-0. The beauty of this is where the Croatian players went to full the whole extra time and penalties in seeing off Japan earlier on today as Raphinha comes inside. Now towards Neymar, into the penalty area, looking for the fancy little trick to try and drag it around. Kim Min Jae cleared away by South Korea is that Cite now is going to have the luxury, surely, if not making changes at the start of the second half, a raft of changes to rest his players going into the quarterfinal. Three o'clock on Friday afternoon. Yeah, absolutely. Well, Cite rested his players, or many of his players, and the defeat against Cameroon, didn't he? He has that option again. Just there, if I was him, I'd be wrapping Neymar in cotton wool and wonder to have a few minutes of game time. This is Raphinha, ball played forward, Paketa chips it now towards Richalison. Look at the space for Richalison, right-hand side racing into the penalty area, and Richalison, saved by the keeper's legs, comes out to Neymar on the follow-up, couldn't keep it down, ballooned away from him, out for a goal kick so close to a fifth in stoppage time. Well, this could, this should be eight. Brazil have been wasteful, but Korea trying to get themselves back into the game, I mean, is it the definition of madness there, just throwing bodies forward, leaving big gaps for Richalison, drove from inside his own half, straight through on goal, should have slotted it in the far corner, could save the keeper again though. South Korea are attacking, on the over lap, on the right-hand side is Kim Moon-Hwan, it'll be kept alive on this near side by Hwang on the left of the penalty area, plays it back, Kim Jinsu with the other cross towards the far post, good header out by Danilo. Kim Moon-Hwan collects it for South Korea, far side, still to their credit, they're having a go, despite trailing by four goals to nil, here is Son, quickly challenged, but as a result of that, and they are pushing the fallbacks forward, they leave themselves open to the counter-attack. Now as the time's reported in 2019, I think it had my age of 44, so clearly too young to remember 1966, unlike a certain John Murray, that the largest winning comeback in a World Cup game, Eusebio inspired Portugal from 3-0 down against North Korea in their quarter-final game at Goodison Park to win 5-3. So for South Korea to turn it around, not that you're going to give them much hope, I'm sure Chris, that is the task that awaits them. Eusebio top scorer there, World Cup as well. Eusebio scored 9 goals in 1966, I feel like who wants to be a millionaire. Are you Chris Terrell or Chris Sutton? Anyway this is Mark Chapman, the half-time whistle has sounded, and I'm sure that Chris is going to be asked lots of questions because Brazil have been stupendous, 4-0. But of course he and that comeback from Portugal against North Korea equaled another comeback of a similar magnitude at an earlier tournament, didn't it? I've just done the 45 minutes, right? This is your 15 minutes of glory, the two of you, I'll let you have your own fun, I'm having a breather. Listen, I hear that there's a lot of strikes back home, I'm now going on a strike here. Austria in 1954 came back against Switzerland in that World Cup, they were 3-0 down, and of course they went on to win memorably 7-5. If I can't remember 66, I've got no chance of remembering before that. Right, just before you rest for this half, what was your favourite goal out of those four? The Richalison one, the fact that he was like a performing seal, the hat trick of headers, playing keep you up. I'd like to see it again, I'm sure, Marquinhos Square, I think it was Thiago Silva's forward goal. It was Thiago Silva, yeah. The two central defenders creating a goal for Richalison, just brilliant. He's done that before, the juggling the ball with his head, he did it for Everton against Manchester United last season towards the end of the season. He did that as well, which is your favourite goal? Oh, yeah, I'd say for Richalison as well. It was just a lovely moment, it's okay, show-boating it, well it wasn't actually show-boating was it? He was trying to win the ball, a couple of extra headers, it was just that awareness to play the ball quickly round the corner. I didn't actually realise it was Thiago Silva, but it was Marquinhos who he played the ball round the corner to, who slotted it across to Thiago Silva. He's sent a half-partner and it was a beautiful way to pass. They all went and celebrated with Thiago Silva as opposed to Richalison. Yeah, which is slightly harsh on Richalison, but the weight to pass from Thiago Silva, Richalison's carried on his run and wonderful first touch and then he's not going to miss. I mean, it's as easy as you like, slotted it into the corner, but this is, I do really think that this is Brazil turning up now and saying to the other teams in the tournament, you know, we're ready. We are serious now and this is us at our very best and we are going to take some stopping. I mean, Vinicius's goal, he had to bend that round for defenders and the goalkeeper. And then the ball over for Pachetar's finish for the, I mean, bar the penalty or the other three goals, you're going, wow. Yeah, I mean, even you're smiling. No, I am. Just how calm was Vinicius Jr. when the ball comes across? I'm telling you, most people would think, I'm going to go first time with this, you know, maybe try and hit into the far corner. He slowed himself down. He knew exactly what he wanted to do, took a touch, took his time and then just lifted the ball over the keeper. You know, he was aware the keeper was going to come flying out, but there were three or four defenders there as well and just clipped the ball beautifully into the far corner. The penalty from Neymar was pretty cool as well. You mentioned the scoop and it was a scoop from Vinicius Jr. to Pachetar who slotted it away brilliantly and Brazil have missed other chances as well. I mean, they had taken the chances. It would have been seven or eight. Come on then, Clever Cloggs. What was the significance of Austria-Switzerland in 54? What was the significance? Without looking at your iPad. Probably the high-scoring game at a World Cup. Most goals in a match. But is that the same thing? Is that not the same thing? It is. You were cheated though. You cheated. You looked at your iPad. It's not on there. Oh, it's written in the script. No, it's not on there. I was checking who the newsreader was. Alright. Can I get your coat then, though? It's six minutes eight o'clock. Here's Richard Foster. Take the World Cup with you. Catar 2022. On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thanks more. Good evening. The RMT says a series of Christmas rail strikes will go ahead and there'll be another walkout between the 24th and 27th of December. The industrial action is part of a dispute over paid jobs and conditions. The head of the union is Mick Lynch. We feel that we've been competing. We feel that we've been compelled to take this action because of the intransigence of the government delivered to us by the employers and that we've got no choice because what we've been faced with is an extremely detrimental offer. It's a very poor in relation to the pay elements and our members simply aren't in the position of the feedback that we've had to accept the changes that the companies have put on the table. Ministers and rail companies have yet to make any official comment on the new walkout. Eight children in the UK are now known to have died from an invasive Strep A bacterial infection. Health experts think the early start of the Strep A season could be down to the easing of Covid restrictions. One of the deaths was confirmed by Colf School in southeast London earlier. Our correspondent Nick Johnson is there. Now the headteacher here described the situation as a wholly unexpected tragedy, one that is affecting every single member of the school community. Now the UK Health Security Agency, that's the body which replaced public health England last year, confirmed that the number of cases of Strep A at this time of year are at a six year high. The government says it's engaged with conservative backbenchers to agree a deal scrapping mandatory house building targets in England. Ministers have agreed that the goals won't be mandatory. The Labour leader, Sikir Stammer says he'll abolish the House of Lords if he wins the next general election. He's also announced wide-ranging policies to extend Scottish and Welsh devolution and hand more powers to English regions. Cities across Ukraine have been targeted by another round of Russian missile strikes. Ukrainian officials in Zaffirisya say two people have died. Water and electricity supplies have been affected too. And temperatures could drop as low as minus six degrees Celsius later this week. The Met Office has issued a severe cold weather warning. People are being urged to use their heating and account for vulnerable people. Expert analysis and debate with some of the biggest names in football on the World Cup Daily Podcast. What Gareth Southgate wants is that they can perform under the most intense pressure they will ever experience. And a bit of fun in match of the day, top ten with Gary Linnaker. Micah Richards is back along with Alan Shearer and myself for the biggest international football tournament on the planet. Take the World Cup with you. Listen on BBC Sounds. BBC Five Live The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 with Mark Chapman Here at Stadium 9-7 for Brazil for South Korea Nile at half time the winners will take on Croatia in the last eight. They beat Japan earlier. 3-1 on penalties. Earlier this afternoon England pulled off one of their greatest victories with the 74-round win over Pakistan in the first test in Rale Pindi. There were four wickets apiece for Olly Robinson and Jimmy Anderson. All the reaction to it from half past nine tonight with the test match special team. And also one of the big stories of the day. Warren Gatland is back in charge of the Wales Rugby Union team. He'll take charge of next year's Six Nations and the World Cup. Wayne Pivac left his role today after a poor run of form which included just three wins in 12 matches. We can talk to the former Welsh international Tom Shanklin. I suppose you're not surprised that Pivac has gone because that has been rumoured for a while. Are you surprised at Gatland returning Tom? Sure, I was a little bit. There's no doubt that change had to be made with Wayne Pivac leaving. But I thought what Warren Gatland did for 12 years as Welsh coach, the Grand Slams, the titles, the semi-final of the World Cup in 2019, I thought he left at the perfect time for Wales and I thought he probably took Wales as far as he could. So it does surprise me a little bit that he has come back because the job he's got in his hands is a lot tougher than when he took it over in 2008. But for me it's not been announced yet, but it's the backroom staff as well which is going to be key. Being a head coach and a figurehead of Welsh international rugby is massive, but it's the coaches that he's going to have around him which I think will be just as key. Is this a short-term appointment just to get through that Six Nations and the World Cup and then maybe they have a reset? Yeah, maybe, but I think it was the right decision and then in Wayne Pivac going, I just have to say, Chappers, the way that Wayne Pivac is handling himself over this last week or two has been amazing. He's shown dignity, he's not blamed anyone, he's took full responsibility. It wasn't a B for him, but he's a good bloke and a decent human being and I can only credit him as the way he's handed himself. But I think it might be, we'll see how Wales do over the next Six Nations and World Cup as to Warren Gatland and whether or not he stays a lot longer. He's certainly proven, he's really well respected and often a change is good. I mean, as I said, it's going to be a lot difficult this time round because in 2008 he inherited a load of really good sort of world-class internationals and he had them for like 10 years. Now there's a bit of a change of the guard, there's a new cycle of players coming in so it's going to be a lot tougher, but Gatland's done nearly everything there is to do in Northern Hemisphere rugby so he knows the challenges that are ahead of him and he's confident that he can make a change. This is, and maybe this is not the time to start this discussion, bearing in mind I've got five minutes and a half time left between Brazil and South Korea in a World Cup. But this is much more than just about a head coach with Welsh rugby at the moment, isn't it? It's massive, it's everything, it's the governance of Welsh rugby, it's who's in charge, how decisions are put through because the majority of the board in Welsh rugby is run by amateur level. We've lost two board directors that have been involved in the FTSE 100 companies, we've lost a new CEO today from the Ospreys, there's been CEOs of Welsh rugby and lots of staff from the Welsh rugby being lost and quitting their jobs. So it's absolutely huge, it's about player development, it's about not losing players in the system, it's about academies producing better players, it's about grassroots so it's absolutely massive, it's not just about the Welsh team, it's about the whole of Welsh rugby and have you got spare 45 minutes? Or not. Unfortunately, that is where we have to leave it, but it gives me a chance to plug the Roop Union Weekly pod because I'm sure there'll be much on there as well with Chris and the team. Tom, thank you very much for coming on. Definitely, you know, probably enjoy the game, it's amazing. Cheers, thank you. Cheers, see you soon, thank you. Tom Shanklin from Wales International with us on five lives, Tim Vickrey, our South American football expert rejoins us as well. Well, we can put to bed, they don't score in the first half, can't we? We certainly can, yes. Did you see the pigeon dance? The trademark pigeon dance, it's Richard from the Golds Celebration. Yes, we see, yes, yes. And he went over and he made everyone, including the coach, do the pigeon dance. Well, in that first half, Brazil have done what pigeons do to the South Korean defence, haven't they? What an extraordinary first half. The first goal for me is the clincher, is the absolute clincher because after that South Korea were chasing and the first goal shows the improvement of having Neymar and Paketar back in the side. It's the exchange between Paketar getting half a year behind the defensive line and as you mentioned, the wonderfully cool finish from Vinicius at the far post. Brazil's so much better when there's association through the middle to bring in the wingers into the game and how hard Rashalisson works. Now work back to get that penalty and work like mad to win the ball for that goal. When it's your centre back setting, being creative forces on the edge of the penalty area. But also Tim, you made the point as well, pre-match. Brazil's head coach wanting his fullbacks to be more Manchester City fullbacks rather than Liverpool fullbacks. How they've tucked in, how Danilo has been an extra midfielder from the majority of that first half. That's exactly how it's played out. That's why they're so defensively solid. That's why there's very, very little threat ever to their goal. I feel a little bit cheated because if it wasn't for that last minute, last second South Korea goal against Portugal reserves, we'd have had Brazil against Uruguay now and we'd have had a game of football rather than an exhibition match which this one has become. Tim, thank you. We will talk at full time as well. Brazil just coming back outside of Korea have been out for a couple of minutes and so being put through some little shuffle routines before the Brazilians came out. So they are 4-0 up at half time and I think we say good luck everybody, Chris Sutton and Ian Dennis. What's the South Korea? Absolutely. They've made a couple of changes. Hong Shul has replaced Sung-Hoo Young in the midfield and we've lost to Kim from the defence. Kim Jin-Soo has been replaced by Sun Jun-Hoo at left back. So they are the changes that have been made. So trailing 4-0, this is how they line up now. Kim Sung-Hoo, Kim Moon-Hwan, Kim Young-Gwon, Kim Min-Jae, Sun Jun-Hoo, Hwang Hee Chan, Hong Chul, Hwang In-Bom, Sun Hyun-Min, Cho Gu Sung and Lee Jae Sung. For Brazil who haven't made any alterations leading by 4 goals to nil, they have Alison in goal, Militao right back, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva and Danilo, Casamiro, Neymar Paketa, Rafinha Richalison and Vinicius Jr. And the 4 goals were scored by Vinicius Jr, Neymar Richalison and Paketa. Just brilliant, that first half. It's one of the, as they give the ball away, South Korea and Rafinha, he has Richalison with him, he goes for goals in deflected effort and it's saved by Kim Sung-Hoo, the goalkeeper. It's one of those halves that you can listen back to or watch again, regardless whether you want to do one or the other. Yes it is and Brazil really arriving and making a statement in that first half. I think that, as I said in the first half, that people were looking at that defeat against Cameroon, watching the game and Cameroon hit them with a sucker punch late on, but Brazil had been pretty dominant in that game, made a lot of changes. Cheetah had the right to change so many players, still finished top of the group so it was job done in that respect. Alisson now, got the first team back, they've gone up a couple of levels. So on, get us onto the end of a loose ball and Sohn puts it wide from the inside left channel of the penalty area, still looking for his first goal at this tournament. In fact, Alisson must have got something on there. It's a brilliant save, so even when you do breach the Brazilian back line, you've got Alisson to beat. That's that timing with his dive, spreads himself. Sohn's trying to find the far corner. Sohn with a corner kick right hand side, two Brazil players both going for the same ball, Danilo and Richarlison, loops off a bit off both of their heads and behind for another corner kick to South Korea who trailed by four goals to nil. Sohn with the corner, it's an out-swinger, Richarlison gets there. Ball then played back towards Sohn and it's too far ahead of him and out of play goes for a goal kick. I mean, I remember watching the 82 World Cup and I think of Ed Ayer, Zico, Falcao, Socrates and that's still a team that I reflect on now. If you've got a young boy or young girl in 22-11 on BBC One, it's too late for them to stay up. Take it for them tonight, BBC One the highlights, because some of the football tonight, the Brazil have played are going to be, certainly I think that Richarlison goal could be a goal that's replayed down the years as far as great World Cup moments go. What a World Cup he has had so far, that brilliant overhead kick in the first game, but this year's Junior, his finish. I think this is what we expected earlier on in the tournament, the Brazilian swagger, the tricks and flicks. Here is Rafinha on the far side. Just on your tape and stuff. Do people still have VHSs? Hello, hello, yeah. Four minutes into the second half. Tape it, record it, it's the same thing, isn't it? Listen, I'm not into it, you know. I say I'll tape it, I'll still tape it. Out he goes to the far side, Rafinha. Rafinha to the byline, shivering his way towards the right side of the penalty area. Paketar goes inside, Casamiro goes square. Now it's with the Vinicius Junior. If it wasn't a VHS, you'd wear it out time and time again, watching some of the goals in the first half. South Korea try and beat the Brazilian press, they're forced to go back. Kim Young-won. I felt last night I was being bullied at times. I can sense another claim going into HR. Present is a very harsh, they're critical. What happened to the support from the BBC? There's a mob of three to my left hand side, isn't there? The searching ball out towards Wang. Comes in field, the reverse ball played out towards Kim Young-won. The Brazil now have it with Casamiro and there's a break-off, floated ball over the top. Taking on the ROM with his first touch up the head by Rafinha. Right side of the penalty area, Rafinha, look for the run of Neymar. Neymar's meant to be playing in midfield. He keeps joining the forward line at every opportunity. Mind you, we can because De Nillo's playing in midfield from the left back roll. The swarming all over South Korea. Oh, they are. South Korea, they're trying to get back in the game. They're four-nil down. Is it naive? It's not going to happen. They're willing, but it's Casamiro, let the ball run beautifully across his body. Passed one of the South Korean midfielders and hit a long diagonal ball to Rafinha. Eventually trying to cross the ball in, but it was blocked. Paulo Bento knew that he needed a miracle tonight for South Korea. If he had taken it, he'd be looking to erase it. As he sighed, a four-nil down, six minutes into the second half. He might be looking to learn from it. That's what, when you make a mistake, it's what you do, isn't it? You never made a mistake. I make mistakes all the time. I've made a few tonight. Here is Wang. As you lot, you mock the crew, no only too well. De Nillo tied his up and inside his penalty area and then clears. So we now know one half of the draw. Argentina, Netherlands and then Croatia against Brazil. The winners of England, France will take an either Spain, Morocco or Portugal, Switzerland, as we still wait for the other side, the other half of the draw here in this Qatar World Cup to take shape. But this is certainly an ominous warning for Croatia, Netherlands and Argentina in Brazil's half, leading by four goals to nil. Here is Wang and Bom in the midfield. Up it goes towards Lee Jey Sung. Out of play it goes for a goal kick to Brazil. Yeah, he's unlucky. Lee Jey Sung makes a run beyond that Brazilian back line. Son tries to find him with the pass but just muscled out by the tower. Your favourite card game with Didier Deschamps was Trumps, was it not? Yeah, Trumps, yep. Brazil have had a few tonight, haven't they? Top Trumps. Top Trumps. Now there is a game. Talking of VHS recorders, I used to love a game of top Trumps. Eight minutes into the second half. Brazil leads South Korea by four goals to nil. BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds. Tomorrow we've got Morocco, Spain, three o'clock, Vicky Sparks and Pat Nevin, Portugal, Switzerland at seven, Alistair Bruce Ball and Rob Green, Rick Edwards live in Doha at six o'clock in the morning for five live breakfast. Here is Tiago Silva. Played forward by Danilo, Vinicius Jr. When does Chite, the Brazilian coach, start to make changes to rest a few legs ahead of that quarterfinal on Friday afternoon against Croatia? Yeah, I think this is a really interesting one because if anything happens to Neymar, you know, went off injured in the Swiss game, I know he will want the minutes and when you four nil up, you can do your flicks, your tricks on the ball now. They can't afford for Neymar to miss out if they want to go all the way. Casamiro spreads the ball out towards Rafaena. Rafaena on the right hand side crosses the ball, headed away well by Kim Moon-Hwan. Picked up though by Tiago Silva. Now it's with Casamiro, lays it off towards Marquinhos, rolls it along the ground out towards Rafaena, far side to right, yellow shirts, blue shorts, playing from right to left, inside towards Paccatá, the return ball to Rafaena, Rafaena twisting and turning, great save by the goalkeeper. Full stretch, still Brazil have it, Vinicius Jr. now threatening, his shots deflected behind for a corner, Brazil so close to a fifth, the goal kick must have come off a Brazil touch, so close to a fifth goal. This is brilliant though from Rafaena, comes inside from that right hand side on his left foot, just feeds a precise pass to Paccatá, who pops the ball back first time, shapes the shoe with his right foot, chops back onto his left foot and tries to slide the ball into the far corner. That's a big hand from Kingsong Hu. Tell us how tonight, tweeted on their social media, let's go together for one more start. Certainly the five times winners have put in a five star display and they are looking for that fifth goal as we enter the 55th minute of this contest here in Stadium 9-7-4. As once again that banner is being unfurled in that bulk of Brazilian support behind the goal where Brazil are attacking. And it has, Pelle adorned on it and the message is quite clear, in bold green letters, Pelle get well soon. Certainly he sent the message knowing, sending it to the teams and I'll be watching from hospital, I'll be rooting for each and every one of you. And that is certainly shared, that sentiment for everybody connected, not just of course in Brazil but also in the footballing world, that everybody is rooting for Pelle, even Killingham Bapé had posted something yesterday as Vinicius Jr. plays the ball inside, he's come up, got options to his right, bundled off the ball and it will be a free kick. It was Son Jun Ho with the free kick left of centre and just over 25 yards out. Brazil 4, South Korean Il, you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live. Yeah, in Neymar territory this, clever little shift there to win the free kick. Would we say 30 yards out? Level with it, he's after in near post, suits the right footer, wouldn't you think? Raphinha over the ball as well, Casamiro. He must just be dishing out advice, just rubs Neymar's nose there. Not quite 30 yards, just a little shy of that, it's left of centre, might suit the left footer of Raphinha if he wants to try and wrap it around the wall of South Korea. Neymar, Casamiro's walked away, Neymar in discussion now with Raphinha, Clementer Pan is the French referee, Raphinha or Neymar. We're approaching the Al-Mar, come BBC Radio 5 Live, Raphinha left footer, takes an inflection off the wall and behind for a corner kick. Raphinha can't quite get enough elevation on the ball, the opportunity in this corner, Neymar, rusting up the crowd, the showman. Getting a great ovation as well as he walks just down towards our left hand side and now he rolls it to Vinicius Jr. who works it on the inside. Diny Loes with a cross, headed away on the edge of the penalty area by Kinyan Gwan, up towards Tottenham Sont, quickly challenged by his teammate Richarlison. Free kick goes though in favour of the South Korean on the halfway line. We talked about how good they've been this evening on the ball but when they give the ball away recovery's been excellent as well. South Korea with Kinyan Gwan at the back, forward ball, Lee Jae-sung left of the centre circle, passes the ball to Conchul, now out to Kim Moon-Hwan. His cross from the right hand side, ups its way all the way across towards the left hand side. Militare with the block, South Korea still attacking, Conchul looking for the return ball, stopped by Paketa, out towards Conchul. Gwang In-bong makes the run, Chul inside once more, always felt it was going away from Lee Jae-sung. South Korea though have retained the ball and now Sun Jun-Hoo and out to that far side where Lee Jae-sung takes over, spreads play to Kim Moon-Hwan. Right corner of the penalty area, the right back goes infield, Sun takes over but moves away from the penalty area, now will come again as he tries to thread it through towards Cho-Goo Sun. The Brazil are on the attack with Vinicius Tunier instead, over the halfway line, plays the ball infield, Richarlison looking for the return to Vinicius Tunier, tied it up by Sun Jun-Hoo, clearance though only as far as Richarlison who plays the ball back. We've been playing for an hour on five-live, half an hour left to continued enjoyment of watching this excellent football being played by Brazil, Chrisson. Yeah, that's where Brazil wanted to be this evening, to really work at it in the first couple of games, Serbia and Switzerland, to break down tight defences but fallen in love at half time, pressure off. They can do their thing, pop the ball around, it will. Just to put it into perspective, that Cameroon defeat which Tim Vickery said had been treated rather harshly back home as Neymar moved breaks down on the edge of the area. That defeat was Brazil's second defeat in 31 in all competitions since the start of 2020. They are a side that is not accustomed to losing, they've won 25 and drawn four. You know, standards are so high and expectation is so high but it was, you know, they did change nine players in that game and they dominated the game. Cameroon scoring very late on, still finished top of the group. But also 13 clean sheets in 17 qualifiers and they're looking for a third clean sheet in four at this World Cup here in Qatar. 62 minutes play, BBC Radio 5 live. Chogusung who's been linked with Celtic and Borussia Dortmund unable to get onto that as the ball is played forward by Casemiro. Vinicius Jr picks it up, Neymar waits out towards his left hand side, Vinicius Jr has made the run ahead of him, instead he picks out Raphinha. Raphinha creates the opening and again the goalkeeper stands tall at his near post, Kimson Q, keeping out Raphinha for a second time in this second half. That fifth goal will not arrive, 4-0 Brazil. Brilliant goalkeeping, Vicius Jr running the ball inside his own half, pops the ball out left to Neymar who drives on the inside on his right foot. Think maybe is thinking about a shot himself but sees Raphinha in a better position, pops it to the right hand side of the box. Raphinha shapes the shoot left footed onto his right foot and a good save at his near post, Kimson Q. Danielle there's going to be coming on for Milit out, much decorated right back, 56 major honours in his illustrious career. But the one that has eluded him is the World Cup, he's actually got his own videos, the World Cup dream that he posts. DVDs or? It's available on Betamax I think you'll find. His appearance against Cameroon means that he actually became Brazil's oldest player to play at a World Cup. With a 39 year old he's on, Brazil are attacking, Richalison free kick sounded by Clemente Pan. I think he was captain in the last game, would he be the oldest captain ever at a World Cup? Ian? Listen, I've got the oldest goal scorer and the oldest player at a World Cup but I don't have the oldest captain. There's only so many facts and figures you can have at your fingertips. Danielle there's been the oldest player for Brazil, was rather pertinent, yours was not. As we approach the 64th minute on BBC Radio 5 Live and Brazil haven't been able to add to their tally of their four goals that they scored in the first half. But South Korea are going to be making another change and his first appearance at this tournament for the 25 year old midfielder, Beck Sung Ho who actually began at Barcelona, his career when he was scouted at the age of 13. Only made a couple of appearances for the B team before he left to play his trade at Darmstadt in Germany. But here he comes on for his first appearance and he replaces Hwang Moon Bong. Feel free to pick up at any point. Yeah just seeing Tiago Silva go down there. That's the danger, that's what she has to think about when one player is getting injured. Well you're surely approaching that point aren't you in the second half where you're thinking, well I mean the game was won when the third goal went in. Remember the third goal scored, that was scored just before the half hour of that great goal by Richarlison at the 29 minutes. Wasn't necessarily one at 3-0. Ball over the top, Rafinha running forward, Flag stays down, Rafinha enters the penalty area, cuts it back, Richarlison couldn't get there, it's a late flag. Now it's up, the referee there lets play continue, South Korea bring the ball away. Well unless you're thinking that they were able to produce a comeback of record equaling proportions of Austria in 54 or Portugal in 66 as you know only too well, I think it's fair to say that the game was over at that point, 66 minutes played, Vinicius Jr goes down, Foul says the French referee, it's going to be a long 24 minutes not just for the listener and myself but also for South Korea, Chrisson. Absolutely is, as a game is won. Brazil maybe have just lost their snap with the passing, their crispness and their purpose they know it's over. They just want to ease through this last 34 minutes or so, just South Korea, it's playing for pride isn't it? Here is Kim Moon-Hwan, Hwang with the cross, the Wolverhampton Wanderers player, 13 appearances without a goal so far this season. Pass from Danny Albers just meant that Alisson had to accelerate just a little across his own goal, it was cleared out of play for a throw, we're approaching the midway point of the second half as Brazil will be progressing from, I say with a great deal of confidence, their last eight game matches now at the round of 16 this stage in the World Cup since they were last eliminated by Argentina in 1990. There is the prospect of a Brazil-Argentina semi-final as Casemiro helps it on towards Neymar, but tying up in the midfield was this man here, Son Jun-Ho is now Hwang on the near side, goes in field to the substitute, Beck Son Ho, carrying it off now is Lee J Sun, out it goes towards that far side the left, first time cross comes in, two red shirts in the penalty area, Alisson with another good save, the block, the follow up, Son twice had a nibble of it, brilliant defending by Brazil, the determination, the desire to keep the clean sheet when you're leading by four goals to Neal and no wonder that they're high-fiving left-right and centre, because Alisson with a save and then at least two excellent blocks and still South Korea can't get a consolation. There's a ball crossed in from the left-hand side, goes all the way through, I think Danilo should do better, comes off his chest and just falls, Wang Hee Chan who hammers the ball, right footed and looks like he's heading into the corner and all of a sudden Alisson's big right hand gets out and makes the save and then you see that dogged determine Brazilian defending, four nil up, we're not going to let one in, body's on the line. Before tonight Tottenham's Son has had the most, well it had nine shots on target without a goal at this World Cup, only Mussiala of Germany had recorded more. I've got a feeling that Son must be getting close to Mussiala's tally of 12, just hasn't fallen for him, it was a great block by Marquinhos, there's a Brazilian player who is down at the moment, I think it might be... Casemiro, it is Casemiro, I'm thinking Cheetah now with 20 minutes remaining, he's only made the one change by bringing on Danny Alves for Mino Sao. Yep, so you're thinking... They've changed it. I've not been saying this for the last 25 minutes, you haven't responded until now, now you're agreeing with the point. You've had Bruno Guimarez who's made a couple of appearances off the bench, Anthony has made two substitute appearances before he started against Cameroon, thinking the Manchester United player, Martinelli just one sub appearance and one start against Cameroon, Fabinho one appearance, but there is activity down below and we are going to be seeing Martinelli as one of them and Bremer is going to be the other change, who's actually named after the former German defender Andreas Bremer, who's a central defender. So he started against Cameroon, so the 25 year old will be coming on. Brazil lead by four goals to nil and that will mean that we've got still one opportunity for them to make another double change for Cheetah, the coach, as Brazil lead four nil. South Korea have kept plugging away to their immense credit, real spirit from a neutral after the delights of the first half, one would have been hoping for more goals for Brazil, they really did turn on the style, cross delivered from the right hand side by Kim Moon-Hwan, Curls out of play. Wang Heechana has played off the right hand side of South Korea in this second half, as Brazil Cheetah is making the changes, there will be two Algo Silva, whatever he's coming off, let's have a look. Danilo is the first player to come off, now he deputized for Alexandro at left back, Danilo who had picked up an injury as well, he started against Serbia but missed the last two, so again this will be an opportunity just to rest Danilo, because if there is still a doubt over Alexandro and Alex Teles, his course is out for the tournament, then Danilo who is filled in so well tonight will certainly need to rest his legs, and then the other player to come off was Vinicius Jr to be replaced by Martinelli of Arsenal. Yeah, like for like Vinicius Jr, Martinelli, tremendous season four Arsenal, hasn't he? I was just wondering about Thiago Silva though, because he went down I think there's more of a kick than a twist, I wonder whether he would be rested, taken off as a precaution. 17 minutes remaining of normal time. Bram is gone into that left back roll. Here is Martinelli ahead of him on this left hand side, yellow shirt, blue shorts playing from right to left. On a night where we've talked about VHS recorders, top trumps, you're listening to the good old wireless of BBC Radio 5 live, but if you're up to terms with the new digital age then BBC sounds is the way forward, and if you haven't downloaded that app then please do so, and you can listen to the rest of the tournament through that, you can take it wherever you go, and tomorrow Morocco, Spain at three, Portugal, Switzerland at seven. This has been a very enjoyable evening. I hope not many do, but Brazil have announced their arrival at the World Cup, they won the group, but they're finding the rhythm at the right time. It's my way to start the tournament, it's how you finish. As Dino's off with no only too well, the oldest captain at the World Cup when Italy of course beat Brazil in 1982. Ah, that's a question. There's your answer. Question, yeah. 16 minutes. What about the oldest outfield, captain? You know what I said I've enjoyed being with you alongside tonight, don't push it. I suspect he is, I can't. 16 minutes remaining. It is Kim Min Jae running forward. Now, Bex Sung Ho in the midfield for South Korea. Son turns right side of the penalty area, plays it back. This is Hwang out of play, goes for South Korea. One thing you'd have to say about South Korea, they haven't buckled, they haven't capitulated. It is a credit to them, four nil down on the end of an absolute hammering. Bex Sung Ho, edge of the area, turning, prodding it goalwards, comes out. No shooting opportunity there for Basant. It'll be a Brazil throw on this near side. Quarter of an hour to go. And, uh, Alisson in his first couple of games, didn't I think he had a shot to save? They have worked him this evening, on two or three occasions, the save he made in the first half from Wang. He made two low-mines, if you remember. Perotius effort, both 30 yards out, save the byline. And the one is three from Wang, in fact. Wang in the second half. But they just, they're going through the motions a little bit up, they know. Yeah. Brazil. Playing within themselves. Which is only natural, you think, self-preservation. You've got a quarter-final Friday afternoon, you'll hear it on BBC Radio 5 Live. And BBC Sounds at three o'clock, Croatia against Brazil. To be followed by Argentina against the Netherlands. You know, Saturday night, England against France. As South Korea have made a change, which I'll tell you about after we've got this free kick, looking for a consolation. Playing an all-red from left to right. Taken by the right back, Kim Moon-Hwan into the penalty area. Shot by Dan, great goal by Baek Sung-Ho. Marks his first appearance in the World Cup with a stunning consolation. Hitting so sweet. Brazil for South Korea won. What a goal from Baek Sung-Ho. Yeah, this is an incredible strike it is. We talked about Allison making three really important saves for Brazil. As the ball is whipped and it's headed clear. It's by Braemac. In fact, Sung-Ho must be all of 25 yards out. Left-footed. Hammer's a half-volley. I think it does take a slight deflection of a Brazilian backside. But it flies into the corner. Allison, even the great Allison couldn't keep that out. The checking for a possible offside leading up to the goal. But the fact that Brazil had restarted. The Brazilian had headed the ball out. That would have been... The check is over. Yeah, that wouldn't have made any sense, would it? But we were complimenting South Korea for their spirit. They deserved that consolation. I'm not patronising them, but they deserve it. I'm with you. That was a strong challenge. The change, by the way, Lee Jae-sung who plays his football in Germany for Mites. He has gone off the field of play and he's been replaced by another Lee. Lee Kang-In. Who is said to be somewhat of a creative talent. He can play wide, he can play as a 10, plays for Mallorca. After coming through the Valencia Academy. I tell you what, we've been treated to some good goals tonight. Yeah, I do think that one took a slight deflection. But very clean, striped, crisp effort. Technical effort. The ball's sitting there, ready to be struck on the half volley. Didn't lash at it, brought it beautifully with the in-step. Slight deflection, no chance for Anderson. This doesn't happen very often, but we're going to have the third-choice goalkeeper coming on for Brazil. Very, very experienced as well. Palmeiras, he plays forward. Brazil got Olympic gold in 2016. He's 34 years of age, so he is going to be coming on. Webberton in the goal. Edison, you might recall, started against Cameroon. And there's also going to be another player who's going to be coming on down below. Rodrigo, I think. And it's Rodrigo. You can quite see the back of the number as he gets his final instructions from Tite. 4-1-2 to Brazil. Did ever so well on the way to claiming gold. Six years ago, five clean sheets as they... Ball is up towards Cho. And beaten out by Anderson, and going down into the ground late flag. Haven't seen much of Cho this evening. He's been marshalled really well. Marquinhos and Thiago Silva all just clipped him behind. It's a tight one. Makes a run in between Thiago Silva and Greymar. He's playing in that unfamiliar position, but left back. Cho takes his shot into the floor. Allison made the save anyway. Here comes Allison. He's coming off. This is a nice touch though, this, because this is their last opportunity to make changes. He could have rested any number of the outfield players, but he's taking off Allison, one of the best keepers in the world, the undisputed number one. And it's the third choice, Webberton, coming on to replace him. For what will be a cameo appearance for him with nine minutes remaining, and no surprise to see Rodrigo replacing Neymar. Just imagine if Sassgaria score again, you've got your third choice keeper. Is that the right call? Yeah, I think it is. He's a calm goalkeeper. Five clean sheets he got during the Olympics. That's the Olympics. And it goes to the other end. This is the world cup here, come on. You say that, but Uruguay actually believe that their two Olympic goals that they won a long, long time ago constitute, that's why they've got the four stars in their shirts. They believe that the Olympic goals are worthy of the four stars on the shirt. Five, of course, are on the shirts of Brazil. There's the ball played back towards the goalkeeper of South Korea, and Kim Sung-kyu managed to get the ball away. He did really well there, didn't he? Quick feet because he was under major pressure from Raphinha. Two quick touches for himself and big, big trouble. So Rodrigo on for Neymar, eight minutes remaining, and that's it now. Chite can't make any more substitutions. Brazil freezing their way in to the quarterfinals of this world cup here in Qatar. You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live. Don't forget the World Cup daily, a daily dosage from Doha with a debate and the analysis looking ahead. And South Korea have also made a change and Cho has gone off, and Ojo has come on to replace him, and indeed here he is, the substitute for Olympiacos. He's on loan from Nottingham Forest, actually, is the 30-year-old. But what is his fourth appearance at this World Cup? Over 50 appearances for South Korea. He's come on for Cho Gusan. Seven minutes remain. South Korea out it goes to this near side for Hwang, the right. In field, the goal scorer, Beksung Ho, Sun Jong-ho. Little touch now, maybe they come forward here on that far side for Lee Kang-in. Patiently they play the ball out. Never stop trying South Korea. Brazil are just going to defend for these closing stages. Hwang plays the ball down line, first-time cross from the right back, Kim Moon-hwan, who was ahead of him, very advanced across the face of goal, out of play for a goal kick. But I wouldn't think there's a great deal of concern for Cheetah on the bench. The second half, it's been like a bounce match, really. For Brazil, it's been pretty half-hearted, hasn't it? They're already thinking about Croatia, the next test, and South Korea have actually played some OK stuff. But this is Brazil second half, lacking the intensity. Did enough in the first half to put this game to bed. Well, if we had the flair for the best part of the hour, they've resorted to a little bit more of the functional style of a team, say from Dunga down the years for Brazil, as Martin Eli on this near side, the left level of the penalty area, do they have time for a fifth goal? As waiting is Rodrigo. Rodrigo, now they go back. Paccatá, Casamiro, all the way back to Brema. Paccatá has shown some nice touches this evening. Struggled a little bit in the West Ham jersey, hasn't he so far? Or maybe not struggled, but hasn't produced what I think the West Ham fans thought he was capable of producing. The record signing could be worth just over £50 million for West Ham. Twelve appearances yet to score. Give him time, though, he's certainly a talent. With his left foot, the attacking midfielder, under five minutes remain. Brazil lead, South Korea by four goals to one. BBC Radio 5 live. South Korea with Kim Min Jae to Kim Young Won. And now out towards the far side for Hong Chul. Forced to go back towards their goalkeeper, Kim Sung-Kyu. He plays it forward, strikes Rodrigo, he gets the ball back from Richarlison and a good block coming in from Kim Min Jae. And out of play it goes for a Brazilian throw, and the goalkeeper getting in a tangle. Should have made more of that, Brazil. The goalkeeper careless, kicks the ball straight into Rodrigo, Richarlison, and tries to reverse it back. Rodrigo, the block comes in. They could have scored more in fairness with Brazil. Anywhere anymore. Talked about their record win, as the header is guided back by Kim Min Jae towards his keeper. The record win was 7-1 against Sweden in 1950. They could easily have had seven goals here tonight, such as being the style that we've all enjoyed, just three and a half minutes remaining. And a lot of empty blue seats now appear inside Stadium 974 that will be signing off. Said before that this stadium has seen the most goals behind the Kaleifa International Stadium. 21 in total in its seven games at this temporary venue. Are we to have another one before Stadium 974 signs off with its recycled shipping containers which will be dismantled? There are a lot of... I mean, this is the type of game that you wouldn't want to leave early. Personally. If you pay good money, I just want to watch Brazil, just in the hope that we get another goal. We might get another goal as South Korea are attacking on that far side the left. Ross is delivered. Wang looking to meet it. Couldn't get there. Danny, brother Bremer was challenging him. Martinelli inside. That was a foul. Did well, Bremer, actually. Cross from the left-hand side. The high ball. Wang had the run on him. Just saw him coming, used his body. Leashed him. Hard as a white. Two minutes of normal time remaining then on BBC Radio 5 Live. Weaverton, the goalkeeper out towards the far side. Little ball laid back. Danny Albers, he releases Rafinha. Rafinha now running forward. Three yellow shirts to aim for. Rafinha right corner of the area. Crosses the ball, looking towards. Gabriel Martinelli headed away by the South Korean defence. Back it goes to Martinelli on this near side. Brazil playing from right to left. 90 seconds remaining. How good has he been against him? Casemiro, such an integral part of the team, isn't he? Paul Chipptown. Rafinha comes inside, but headed away by Kim Min Jae. Paketa, a little layup to Casemiro with his back to goal. Just cleans everything up, doesn't he? Here is Rodrigo looking to Martinelli. Martinelli enters the penalty area, goes on the outside towards the byline. Martinelli pulls it back. Danny Albers with the acrobatics and deflected behind for a corner kick. That would have put the icing on the cake if Danny Albers would have taken it on the scoresheet here. 4-1 Brazil. That would have been delightful. Danny Albers, ball slid through from Rodrigo in between centre half and right back. Martinelli to the byline. Just dinks a ball up beyond the far post Albers. Acrobatic right foot volley into the floor from the back of Green Defender. In swinging corner from the far side. Dremel was last touch off him as he tried to attack six yards out. How it goes for a goal kick. We're going to have four minutes of additional time in Stadium 974. BBC Radio 5 live and BBC sounds. And Brazil against Croatia will be the first of the four quarterfinals that will bring you from Friday afternoon at three o'clock after Japan won Croatia one and Croatia going through 3-1 on penalties. South Korea, Crossfield ball. Wang enters the penalty area inside right channel. Little bit off balance, puts it out of play goal kick. Is it Son Jon Ho again with raking Crossfield ball? Diagonal ball to Wang Yi-Chan who takes... decent enough first touch, just sits there. The angle slightly against him. Just rushes his shot, slices it wildly over. And I do think we're all thinking with the way the draw is. Brazil, Argentina in that semi-final, but it's been that strange... strange World Cup, so many surprise results. You wouldn't put it past the Netherlands, beating Argentina. Ball is carried forward for South Korea from Lee Kang-In. He was upended with no foul, Paccata plays it out to Martinelli on this near side, he was definitely foul. Oh, no, he's not the referee's told him to get up. What about Croatia for Brazil? On them earlier bit. Good tournament team, aren't they? Modric still pulling the straight. Well, that is going to be fascinating, Modric against Casanero. The two players will know each other so well from their days at the Bernabéu. Son, back to Kim Moon-Hwan. Out to this near side for Wang Yi-Chan of Wolverhampton. Wanderer scored against Uruguay, which come close on two or three occasions tonight to add to his tally. Still South Korea are attacking. As the ball is played back to Kim Min-Jae. Napoli defender plays it forward, nice little layoff, but cleared on the edge of the area by Paccata. It's a pacy ball up towards the halfway line and Richarlison now tries to get away from Kim Min-Jae on this near side. In stoppage time on BBC Radio 5 Live, Richarlison down towards the corner flag. Three South Korea players are drawn towards him and in the end it was the goal scorer, Bexons-Dumhoe, who put it out of play for a throw. You said it earlier, you don't want to be patronising, but they have really done themselves proud in the way 4-0 down. They could have let their heads really drop, throw the towel in, and they have beat 6-7-8. They have worked exceptionally hard in the second half. They have got the goal, all their consolation, play to the end. They have done exactly that, shot from distance, and Dani Alba is dragged it well, well wide. Bearing in mind at 4-0 down, Paulo Bento must have been thinking a repeat of the 5-1 defeat to Brazil in June would match his heaviest defeat since he's been in charge. He was appointed in 2018, but the second half they haven't caved in, they've kept playing, they've kept going forward, they've had chances, they've got a great, albeit deflected from distance, a consolation. Brazil 4 South Korea won and they can't be long left in terms of stoppage time as the ball is chipped out by Thiago Silva towards Dani Alba. As the broken sweat as Thiago Silva just gets the ball, gives it, his positioning is phenomenal. I mean those two players alone, that's a throwback to 2014. That was when Neymar was ruled out through injury, stretch it off, I think it was in 4-to-laser against Colombia. Tim Vickery will know for sure, he's had a bit of a checkered history in the World Cup, but returning tonight, getting his first goal of this tournament. Neymar returning from an ankle injury, and there is the final whistle. And the tournament favourites who lay at 4-0 at half time, Vinicius Jr. after 7 minutes, Neymar's penalty after 13, brilliant goal from Richarlison just before the half hour, and then that sweeping move finished off by Pakatar, 9 minutes before half time. Brazil could have had more goals, kept out by Kim Sung-Kyu, the South Korean goalkeeper, but South Korea kept plugging away. And the long range effort from Beck Sung-Ho was certainly a fine consolation. But Brazil, they've laid down a marker because it's been so entertaining to watch. The full-time score here in Stadium 974, Brazil falls South Korea 1. Mark. That was great, that was really, really good, wasn't it? Just what an enjoyable game of football. Yep, absolutely. Ian's right, the game is over at half time. I suppose this was the Brazil we all expected to see in the first group game. That didn't materialise to Serbia being difficult to beat, the same with Switzerland, the low blocks, Cameroon sat back in, but it was all about Brazil's early goal, they got the early goal today, and then they blew South Korea away. But the quality of some of the goals, this is Brazil now getting started in this competition and saying we are still the team to beat. At the moment, the players all shaking hands, the South Koreans are now going into a little huddle. Neymar and Danilo, I think it is, have brought out a blue banner that just simply says Pelé on it and has a picture of him as well. And now the whole of the Brazilian team are going to congregate behind that banner in the centre circle. They're just waiting for the last few players to get themselves behind there and the last few of them are being quickly vanicious. And Richardlasen, who looks a very weary man, he has run himself into the ground, he's the last one and he will join them, he'll just crouch down there next to Fred. And now they all hold, they are all behind that banner, a blue banner that says Pelé in white letters on. And then a picture of Pelé, I think that might have been from the 1970 World Cup that they were holding up as well. And there are some more banners with Pelé on in the Brazilian fans' end who are away to our left who have had various banners that have held up throughout the course of the evening. And now the Brazilian players are moving with that banner around the centre circle so that it can be applauded from all four sides of the ground, including the South Korean fans, away to our right, who are dressed all in red. And for those Brazilian players, that's not far off a perfect night and they can then show their respect to the great man as well. Well, certainly, because worrying news over the weekend that the reports that Pelé had begun, end of life care in hospital for colon cancer, he has since sent out a message that he feels strong and he has hope. And that many people hope would offer a little bit of inspiration, but that's a nice touch and a tribute from the players to Pelé who had did say ahead of the game, I'll be watching from hospital and I'll be rooting for each and every one of you. And clearly, he still will be watching and then he will have seen those pictures and that, I'm sure, will be the perfect tonic for him to offer that hope and strength for his own recovery. And now both sets of players move away from the middle of the field. The Brazilians are celebrating and dancing in front of their fans who are still there and they are dancing and celebrating back and bouncing up and down. We'll talk plenty more about Brazil in the next half hour. They've watched really nice at the moment, Chris, is that the South Korean players, the whole squad, are going over to their two groups of fans that they've got in this stadium at the end of way to our right. And those Korean fans are dancing and applauding and waving their flags to their players. There's a real respect there as there should be. I know they've got a shellacking tonight, but they've had a very good tournament. Yes, they had a, you know, I think the aim was to get out of the group. They did that in dramatic fashion with that late goal against Portugal and the manager called it a miracle and doing that. It must have been so difficult for them this evening because essentially the game was over at half time and they could have thrown the towel in, you know, but they came out second half. They fought, they worked hard, right to the last whistle. They got themselves a decent goal. They created opportunities. They worked, Alisson more than he's been worked in this tournament. But, you know, inside in that first half, they took one hell of a battering and they did well to keep going really because the game was over. But they play to the end and, you know, their fans in the stadium are proud of them, applauding them and appreciate their efforts and the quality of football, which they have shown, you know, in the World Cup this competition. But just tonight they were simply outclassed. A brilliant goal, more than a decent goal. Who's a brilliant goal, was it? It took a tiny deflection. It was a great hit. I think there was a big Brazilian bum in there somewhere where it just flicked off. It was a great strike. Actually he replaced Bang and Bob. Right. The goal scorer, Bexson Hall. I think that was a great strike. I'm not disputing that, but... That's all that took a deflection. We will react more to Brazil's win. They've beaten South Korea by four goals to one. They will meet Croatia in the last eight who knocked Japan out on penalties earlier. So we'll talk about both those games in the next half hour. It's exactly midnight here in Doha. Nine o'clock back in the UK. Here's the latest news.
