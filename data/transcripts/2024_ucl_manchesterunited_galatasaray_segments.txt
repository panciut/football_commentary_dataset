[0.00 - 2.24] P:2057.29 E:0.024645 |  All about the special nights in the Champions League,
[2.24 - 6.28] P:2068.24 E:0.073568 |  because this is the 25th appearance in the group stages,
[6.28 - 8.64] P:2082.38 E:0.084257 |  the most of any English side,
[8.64 - 12.00] P:1952.62 E:0.096817 |  and only three behind Real Madrid and Barcelona,
[12.00 - 15.04] P:2045.04 E:0.087489 |  and that record of 28 appearances.
[15.04 - 18.56] P:1994.30 E:0.100220 |  So the Slovakian referee is about to get underway,
[18.56 - 21.96] P:1955.52 E:0.091908 |  but straight away it would look like they are going to play with three at the back,
[21.96 - 27.76] P:2062.76 E:0.090044 |  because Karn Ihan is the central figure of Padukka and Davison Sanchez,
[27.76 - 29.64] P:2080.43 E:0.102253 |  and indeed the ball goes straight to him,
[29.68 - 32.00] P:2048.73 E:0.091476 |  and he hits the ball flat and downfield,
[32.00 - 36.16] P:1991.25 E:0.101629 |  as Galatasaray, all in white, are playing from right to left.
[37.36 - 39.32] P:1921.23 E:0.104085 |  And did you bring the paracetamol with you?
[39.32 - 44.76] P:1983.60 E:0.099984 |  Because those Galatasaray supporters are bouncing up and down in unison towards our right.
[44.76 - 46.72] P:1991.66 E:0.097905 |  We won't be lacking in atmosphere tonight.
[47.88 - 53.96] P:2045.45 E:0.101195 |  One of the most atmospheric countries you're ever likely to visit for Champions League football.
[54.72 - 59.24] P:2022.32 E:0.089376 |  We went to the old stadium, the intimidating Alessane Ien,
[59.84 - 63.68] P:2018.97 E:0.099009 |  that was over 20 years ago, they got rid of that in 2010.
[64.36 - 67.80] P:2030.92 E:0.093803 |  The Sigtaches in Anu Stadium on the banks of the Bosphorus,
[67.80 - 69.80] P:1929.57 E:0.095962 |  boy, they create a real racket as well.
[70.32 - 73.48] P:1968.66 E:0.109677 |  So Manchester United's symbols certainly not having easy when they go to
[73.48 - 76.56] P:2044.73 E:0.098730 |  at West Anvil for the return game later on in this schedule,
[76.56 - 80.76] P:2038.13 E:0.085264 |  and that's why they've got to take advantage of this whole fixture here tonight.
[81.80 - 86.52] P:2023.78 E:0.088834 |  Darlo to Fernandez, little layoff, there was a pediatra, just lifts it forward,
[86.52 - 88.04] P:1898.16 E:0.099646 |  headed on by Terera,
[88.68 - 93.00] P:2028.86 E:0.103312 |  and it comes to Zaha, just showed too much towards Casamiro,
[93.00 - 95.84] P:2123.19 E:0.105058 |  who swept them all the way downfield, Hoyland.
[96.84 - 99.48] P:2114.40 E:0.113325 |  Hoyland skips away from the challenge of Buoy,
[100.04 - 102.56] P:2080.04 E:0.118734 |  and it's used to get away from the Frenchman, took back a little bit,
[102.56 - 107.80] P:2070.37 E:0.102432 |  still keeps on going, Hoyland, does well with the cross and the stabbed effort by Fernandez, his why.
[108.08 - 110.00] P:2026.25 E:0.102805 |  But that was much better from Manchester United.
[110.00 - 115.84] P:2074.48 E:0.092014 |  Has to score, captain Bruno Fernandez has to score this ball across from Hoyland,
[115.84 - 121.00] P:1993.08 E:0.086511 |  and he's just tried to be too precise with his finish, and he's opened his foot,
[121.48 - 123.84] P:2059.25 E:0.093401 |  the angle on his foot too wide, and it's gone wide at the post,
[123.84 - 127.32] P:1979.62 E:0.078850 |  but excellent start by Manchester United and Hoyland in particular.
[128.04 - 129.96] P:1934.42 E:0.097644 |  Yes, it was on that left-hand side.
[130.56 - 135.52] P:2033.70 E:0.102206 |  They lacked quality in the final third against Crystal Palace at the weekend,
[135.52 - 140.16] P:1985.72 E:0.098595 |  although when they did come forward, they were met with a real resilient Crystal Palace side,
[140.16 - 145.52] P:2007.26 E:0.096586 |  with Gehi and Anderson in particular outstanding at the back for Roy Hoggson's side.
[145.84 - 148.16] P:2037.03 E:0.109151 |  On Saturday, Stortport won, Forrest Green-Neal,
[148.16 - 153.52] P:2026.31 E:0.100296 |  Bolton Wanderers are leading in League One at home to Stevenage by a goal to Neal,
[153.52 - 159.16] P:2035.01 E:0.104356 |  Oxford United won, Shrews Green-Neal is the latest score, Oxford who are second in League One.
[159.76 - 165.44] P:2054.97 E:0.089539 |  But Eriksen Haag, well they wanted a positive start, and they've got a good tempo so far.
[165.44 - 169.92] P:2040.01 E:0.094176 |  Yeah, you can already see the intensity, the flow, the space for Fernandez.
[170.16 - 173.40] P:1995.47 E:0.105806 |  Hannibal to Fernandez, he looked for the cross on the right-hand side,
[173.44 - 178.28] P:2128.44 E:0.098981 |  blocked by Angelinho, comes back towards Fernandez, waits to deliver, doesn't do so,
[178.76 - 184.76] P:2043.82 E:0.093398 |  then works over the cross, and then it was cleared away by Terera.
[186.04 - 190.92] P:1954.14 E:0.098325 |  It was the Rabona cross from the right-hand side by Fernandez,
[191.44 - 196.24] P:1978.79 E:0.089868 |  but it didn't fox the Galatasaray defence, however, it's been a start full of purpose.
[196.24 - 200.08] P:2031.48 E:0.090206 |  Absolutely, the fluidity across the Manchester United midfield and forwards.
[200.08 - 204.64] P:1997.00 E:0.084523 |  It was actually Bruno Fernandez finding himself on this sort of right-wing position,
[204.64 - 209.76] P:1938.99 E:0.087271 |  with Hannibal more central, will probably see those two rotating throughout the game,
[209.76 - 213.32] P:2005.64 E:0.088987 |  just to cause Angelinho an issue that left back for Galatasaray.
[214.60 - 218.08] P:1960.19 E:0.096078 |  He talks about the one change that is made, Hannibal coming in for Pallestra
[218.08 - 220.36] P:1951.27 E:0.093352 |  because of the energy that he can provide.
[220.96 - 224.76] P:1960.88 E:0.098009 |  Probably at this stage he's unable to play three games in a week,
[224.76 - 228.72] P:2013.92 E:0.099541 |  the Tunisian international, but he's certainly recognisable,
[228.72 - 235.72] P:1978.68 E:0.091479 |  with his mop of hair as he's waiting for Galatasaray to take a throw on that right-hand side.
[236.64 - 240.56] P:1965.62 E:0.095502 |  Okan Burak is the coach of Galatasaray.
[241.16 - 244.36] P:2022.60 E:0.094933 |  He was actually in charge of Istanbul, Basakşehir,
[244.36 - 248.64] P:1995.30 E:0.084001 |  when they beat Manchester United in Istanbul in November 2020.
[249.04 - 254.76] P:1988.11 E:0.081256 |  Covered that game, the defending that night from Manchester United was dreadful,
[254.80 - 259.16] P:1982.09 E:0.098273 |  and even Burak was shocked himself at some of the defending.
[259.16 - 261.92] P:2022.02 E:0.094634 |  It was Kamikaze stuff from Oleg Anasaltzi aside.
[261.92 - 266.16] P:2021.93 E:0.088821 |  They certainly will not be able to afford Galatasaray another such luxury,
[266.16 - 270.08] P:2034.77 E:0.091683 |  with the players that they possess in attack going forward.
[270.08 - 274.64] P:2051.73 E:0.106348 |  Now is Amrabat coming forward from his left back roll, a little bit unfamiliar,
[274.64 - 278.56] P:2065.55 E:0.087321 |  but he's played there now for what? This is his third game,
[278.56 - 283.44] P:2009.89 E:0.084419 |  and he's delighted Ten Haag with his commitment and his professionalism,
[283.48 - 287.84] P:1920.06 E:0.092578 |  but they've lost the ball and it goes back Angelinho all the way to the goalkeeper, Muslera.
[289.68 - 293.96] P:1981.04 E:0.097546 |  Downfield, unchallenged header by Casanero, lifted forward by Mason Mount.
[293.96 - 296.60] P:1988.80 E:0.095078 |  I think Fernandez thought he was coming back from an offside position,
[296.60 - 300.00] P:2026.39 E:0.077958 |  but Badak Ture had just dropped back a little bit deeper.
[300.00 - 301.56] P:1989.02 E:0.070089 |  He was actually on side.
[303.36 - 306.28] P:1916.32 E:0.100139 |  In fact, I said at the start that they might have gone with three at the back.
[306.28 - 307.40] P:1972.78 E:0.091350 |  That was just for the kick-off.
[307.40 - 309.96] P:1942.72 E:0.100042 |  Ayan is actually sitting, isn't he, in that holding roll?
[309.96 - 313.28] P:1998.73 E:0.084298 |  I've actually watched that in this opening five minutes.
[313.32 - 317.04] P:1972.12 E:0.095107 |  Dunno, and they're just changing between a back four and a back three.
[319.20 - 322.72] P:2008.25 E:0.104236 |  We're also live on BBC Radio Manchester tonight here at Old Trafford,
[322.72 - 327.20] P:2023.76 E:0.075727 |  as well as BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds,
[327.20 - 332.32] P:1977.43 E:0.088300 |  the live sport after the excellent coverage that the lads out in Rome provided,
[332.32 - 339.64] P:2019.04 E:0.085537 |  and Catherine of course, lads and lasses out in Rome for the Ryder Cup.
[339.64 - 343.08] P:1989.13 E:0.087861 |  We've got the Champions League tomorrow night, we're at St James's Park,
[343.08 - 347.56] P:1997.19 E:0.080821 |  which will be absolutely crackling Newcastle United against Paris Saint-Germain.
[347.56 - 351.64] P:1971.76 E:0.083191 |  And then we've got the Cricket World Cup, that begins on Thursday morning.
[351.64 - 354.16] P:2017.22 E:0.086554 |  That's on Sports Extra around 9.30.
[354.16 - 357.00] P:1944.75 E:0.103049 |  England against New Zealand, and of course the Rugby Union World Cup
[357.00 - 361.84] P:2001.65 E:0.077326 |  is still ongoing out in France and Friday night, France against Italy.
[361.84 - 365.52] P:1941.95 E:0.088151 |  And then on Saturday, Burnley Chelsea, myself and Izzy together for that one.
[365.52 - 369.56] P:1973.96 E:0.088490 |  England Samoa to follow, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, the second half,
[369.56 - 373.08] P:1965.40 E:0.088078 |  and then that crucial game, Ireland against Scotland from eight o'clock.
[373.08 - 379.00] P:2073.14 E:0.100766 |  So still so much live sport to look forward to on BBC Radio 5 Live
[379.00 - 381.40] P:2009.66 E:0.081386 |  and 5 Live Sport over the coming days and weeks.
[381.40 - 385.52] P:2019.04 E:0.083230 |  Cheltenham Nill Fleetwood 1 is the latest scorer in League 1.
[385.52 - 388.52] P:2019.97 E:0.085928 |  And after that, little flurry of activity at the start,
[388.52 - 390.96] P:2032.91 E:0.081738 |  just seems to have settled down a fraction,
[390.96 - 393.24] P:1880.69 E:0.086056 |  Nill Nill here at Old Trafford, six minutes played.
[393.24 - 395.68] P:1936.26 E:0.093326 |  Yeah, I need a breather after that opening exchange,
[395.68 - 398.32] P:1950.52 E:0.072071 |  trying to figure out how Galatasaray are going to play.
[398.36 - 401.32] P:1947.10 E:0.087012 |  I think I've figured it out that they're playing player for player
[401.32 - 405.68] P:1986.28 E:0.076997 |  against Manchester United, which I actually think will work in Manchester United's favour.
[406.40 - 410.32] P:1911.35 E:0.098172 |  Angelinho looks for the run of Zaha, being tracked by Darlo.
[410.32 - 411.56] P:1952.43 E:0.106829 |  Darlo holds him off.
[412.48 - 414.92] P:1977.20 E:0.105068 |  Now it's with Hannibal, he did well, showed his strength.
[414.92 - 417.16] P:2011.60 E:0.088207 |  Casamira now takes it on,
[417.16 - 419.16] P:2003.86 E:0.116393 |  calling his way through the midfield.
[419.16 - 421.72] P:2020.28 E:0.086504 |  His forward ball takes an inflection, won't quite reach,
[421.72 - 424.56] P:1997.84 E:0.081794 |  Mason Mount over on that far side.
[424.60 - 429.92] P:2007.50 E:0.098866 |  Nassau are surprised about all the headlines about Zaha's return to Old Trafford.
[429.92 - 432.24] P:2027.75 E:0.085031 |  It's not like he's never played here before.
[432.24 - 435.52] P:2028.45 E:0.102690 |  Yes, he was a former Manchester United player, but it was a decade ago.
[435.52 - 437.56] P:2085.95 E:0.070264 |  I think he's proven himself since.
[437.56 - 441.92] P:2053.73 E:0.084149 |  And this is his seventh appearance at Old Trafford,
[441.92 - 443.48] P:2024.81 E:0.098060 |  for the former Manchester United player.
[443.48 - 446.84] P:1983.21 E:0.086320 |  As Amrabat swings over the cross, now it's played forward.
[446.84 - 449.80] P:1966.11 E:0.093305 |  Casamira wins it back, Fernandez towards Hoiland.
[449.80 - 452.48] P:1995.50 E:0.093707 |  The return ball to Fernandez, the United captain,
[452.52 - 456.84] P:2039.18 E:0.086221 |  out to Amrabat, has stayed out wide, early cross, cut out by Buoy.
[456.84 - 458.64] P:1914.70 E:0.085811 |  Buoy now will clear.
[459.92 - 463.48] P:2022.40 E:0.089418 |  Only as far as Casamira lifts it up into the air.
[463.48 - 466.60] P:1987.16 E:0.095983 |  Darlo joins the attack, Angelinho is in front of him,
[466.60 - 469.24] P:2035.91 E:0.107969 |  former Manchester City player, shifts it on the outside,
[469.24 - 471.48] P:2095.77 E:0.094838 |  Angelinho slides into the challenge.
[471.48 - 474.44] P:2080.04 E:0.108592 |  He's appealing for a goal kick, but it's a corner kick to Manchester United.
[474.44 - 477.28] P:2140.73 E:0.085437 |  I think he's got a bit of a shout, Angelinho.
[477.28 - 480.12] P:2179.68 E:0.104114 |  But tell you what, he is one hell of a 1v1 defender,
[480.12 - 483.00] P:2049.12 E:0.094013 |  and you can just see in this situation, watching on the replay,
[483.00 - 486.44] P:1981.87 E:0.101737 |  it's just Darlo in a 1v1 with Angelinho on this right-hand side
[486.44 - 487.92] P:1990.85 E:0.098404 |  for Manchester United.
[489.92 - 492.84] P:2122.51 E:0.101320 |  Well, Fernandez, the Manchester United captain,
[492.84 - 498.00] P:2253.73 E:0.104091 |  to hoots of derision from the Galatasaray supporters,
[498.00 - 503.48] P:2200.94 E:0.097149 |  has come across to take the corner kick on this near side to right.
[504.60 - 508.92] P:2073.96 E:0.106604 |  And it's pulled out towards Hannibal, closed down,
[508.92 - 511.00] P:1997.96 E:0.081444 |  and the break is on.
[511.00 - 515.52] P:2010.55 E:0.086404 |  And it's with Akta Koluk, who's making a strong run through the middle,
[515.52 - 518.04] P:1981.86 E:0.110160 |  he's running at the heart of the United defence, he tries to go it alone,
[518.04 - 521.08] P:2044.20 E:0.092159 |  and in the end it's Darlo, who takes it away off his toes.
[521.08 - 523.24] P:2067.10 E:0.104617 |  Incidentally, by the way, when that corner was taken,
[523.24 - 528.56] P:2004.49 E:0.078975 |  there's been a high netting that has been erected with black stanchions
[528.56 - 531.00] P:2033.43 E:0.088766 |  in front of the Galatasaray supporters.
[531.00 - 534.00] P:2010.17 E:0.087592 |  That's certainly a change since I was here at the weekend,
[534.00 - 537.44] P:2055.09 E:0.087107 |  and yet a still, an object was thrown from the Turkish support
[537.48 - 540.96] P:1957.08 E:0.088708 |  when Fernandez wait to take the corner kick on this right-hand side.
[540.96 - 545.24] P:1990.31 E:0.087221 |  I can still see it just ahead of the quadrant, down towards the right.
[545.24 - 551.36] P:1983.96 E:0.060440 |  So it was erected, and with good reason too.
[551.36 - 553.00] P:1920.73 E:0.073182 |  Nine minutes play, 0-0.
[554.60 - 556.36] P:1878.56 E:0.083793 |  Decent break, wasn't it for Galatasaray?
[556.36 - 558.28] P:1871.39 E:0.099956 |  That's what United have got to be wary about.
[558.28 - 560.80] P:1963.21 E:0.064486 |  It was, and actually Tete was in.
[560.80 - 564.20] P:1931.94 E:0.077602 |  But Akta Koluk didn't see his run, but he was in.
[565.20 - 569.32] P:2011.75 E:0.081042 |  Somebody who they signed from the third tier of Turkish football,
[569.32 - 571.40] P:1934.34 E:0.089803 |  but he's progressed all the way now,
[571.40 - 575.48] P:1990.62 E:0.095463 |  and not just with Galatasaray, but onto the international stage as well.
[575.48 - 581.72] P:2061.69 E:0.089206 |  22 caps for his country, Kerem Akta Koluk, 24 years of age,
[581.72 - 585.32] P:2113.43 E:0.084439 |  contributed four goals in 14 appearances,
[585.32 - 588.28] P:2005.22 E:0.067822 |  fourth season at the club,
[588.28 - 590.84] P:2045.28 E:0.088175 |  had actually been involved with 12 goals,
[590.96 - 594.68] P:2001.22 E:0.083633 |  as they've made a very good start and beaten so far this season
[594.68 - 598.20] P:2030.66 E:0.088543 |  when you consider he's got eight assists to his credit as well.
[598.20 - 600.24] P:2077.34 E:0.096329 |  Stevenage have equalised at Bolton.
[600.24 - 603.20] P:2042.07 E:0.090418 |  It's Bolton won, Stevenage won as the latest scorer in League One,
[603.20 - 607.08] P:2006.71 E:0.091110 |  Charlton, Neal, Exeter won, and Portsmouth, the leaders of League One,
[607.08 - 609.56] P:1990.74 E:0.072629 |  who were actually unbeaten in something like 21 games,
[609.56 - 612.88] P:2006.91 E:0.092805 |  are behind at Fratton Park to Wiccan Wanderers by a goal to nil.
[612.88 - 615.84] P:1926.19 E:0.080464 |  Lindelof forced a turn, down towards that far side.
[615.84 - 618.68] P:1974.93 E:0.091585 |  Galatasaray all in white, attacking the strep for then,
[618.68 - 620.64] P:2076.05 E:0.105853 |  playing from right to left, 10 minutes in.
[620.64 - 625.76] P:2056.83 E:0.081021 |  The defending line on 59-tip, and that will be a goal kick.
[625.76 - 628.80] P:1988.80 E:0.071600 |  Things have just settled down a little bit.
[628.80 - 631.08] P:1963.28 E:0.096210 |  Lindelof does really well, Casimiro doubling up,
[631.08 - 635.88] P:2010.49 E:0.073554 |  just seeing them doing a high five of appreciation for each other.
[635.88 - 641.48] P:1994.28 E:0.076693 |  Classic defensive midfielder role, putting out fires from Casimiro.
[643.12 - 647.16] P:1997.63 E:0.077631 |  The voice of Izzy Christensen, the former England international.
[647.16 - 650.24] P:1985.20 E:0.101533 |  As now it's with Bruna Fernandez in the centre circle,
[650.28 - 652.16] P:2024.83 E:0.097262 |  runs away off the shins of Ihan.
[652.16 - 654.72] P:2120.94 E:0.099075 |  Hannibal plays it forward, Hoylan makes the run,
[654.72 - 658.76] P:2103.96 E:0.095007 |  coming across his production with a ponytail, shows his strength,
[658.76 - 661.64] P:2039.78 E:0.084828 |  and then with a back pass to Miss Laira, all in green,
[661.64 - 665.20] P:1994.65 E:0.096422 |  clears it away long over the head of Zarar, out of play, goes for a throw.
[665.20 - 668.16] P:2041.63 E:0.079598 |  How have Arsenal started in France? Alistair Vrussbaugh.
[668.16 - 671.24] P:1980.22 E:0.109457 |  I would say they're yet to fully settle, just shy of 10 minutes played.
[671.24 - 674.92] P:1881.47 E:0.112093 |  It's longs nil, Arsenal nil, being played in a very boisterous atmosphere.
[674.92 - 676.40] P:1626.54 E:0.117101 |  Longs have been more on the front foot,
[676.40 - 680.08] P:1901.10 E:0.098590 |  one a couple of corners, created the first half chance centre-back Kevin Danso,
[680.12 - 682.08] P:1959.10 E:0.110220 |  shooting wide. Longs nil, Arsenal nil.
[682.08 - 683.72] P:1998.93 E:0.106328 |  Burning of City without a win in five,
[683.72 - 687.64] P:2039.40 E:0.101733 |  and now leading Huddersfield town by two goals to nil at St Andrews in the championship.
[687.64 - 690.44] P:2207.19 E:0.095668 |  Bristol Robersley, Port Vale by a goal to nil.
[690.44 - 693.00] P:2100.14 E:0.096686 |  Miss Tramlia Rovers won Bradford City nil.
[693.00 - 696.80] P:2077.19 E:0.084042 |  Mark Hughes is a manager under pressure of Bradford City in league two,
[696.80 - 699.60] P:1985.98 E:0.080862 |  11 minutes played and they're behind at Brenton Park.
[699.60 - 702.92] P:2080.20 E:0.076928 |  Galatasaray here at Manchester United,
[702.92 - 705.00] P:1918.15 E:0.100715 |  still nil nil on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[705.00 - 707.64] P:2050.86 E:0.085932 |  The sunchests formally have topped them, flokes it forward,
[707.68 - 710.48] P:2045.13 E:0.086523 |  Bowie heads it on, Tete will give chase,
[710.48 - 712.48] P:1876.93 E:0.063405 |  but that will be picked up by Onana.
[714.48 - 717.12] P:1963.54 E:0.104599 |  He was extremely impressive last season,
[717.12 - 719.68] P:2051.43 E:0.096712 |  13 clean sheets in the Champions League,
[719.68 - 721.56] P:1955.92 E:0.088778 |  that was the most of any goalkeeper.
[721.56 - 723.60] P:1992.84 E:0.086973 |  How he could do with another,
[723.60 - 726.76] P:1974.13 E:0.105810 |  he's only kept three in his nine games so far, all in yellow.
[726.76 - 729.36] P:2044.49 E:0.102058 |  The Cameroon International clears it away downfield,
[729.36 - 731.44] P:2099.23 E:0.107325 |  but has he highlighted Angelinho,
[731.44 - 733.68] P:1977.10 E:0.091150 |  and he was watchful to put the ball out of play for a throw.
[733.68 - 737.44] P:2069.19 E:0.083951 |  Yeah, he's done well, marshalling Bruno Fernandez, who is staying out.
[737.64 - 741.56] P:1980.41 E:0.066869 |  On this right-hand side, in these opening three minutes,
[741.56 - 743.64] P:2006.87 E:0.094735 |  from Manchester United, just playing on the shoulder,
[743.64 - 746.92] P:2011.67 E:0.084974 |  playing on the line, as is Rashford on the opposite side,
[746.92 - 750.04] P:2170.75 E:0.074889 |  just trying to stretch the Galatasaray defence.
[751.56 - 753.36] P:2097.41 E:0.112001 |  Ball goes back to Onana.
[753.36 - 756.08] P:2098.31 E:0.101567 |  It was Iqari putting him in pressure,
[756.08 - 759.16] P:1948.05 E:0.100866 |  pressing from the other front, given away by Varan,
[759.16 - 762.76] P:2032.40 E:0.097991 |  won back by Darlo, he was quite high at the pitch on this near side, the right.
[762.76 - 765.04] P:1959.91 E:0.107117 |  Hannibal now feeds it inside towards Fernandez,
[765.04 - 769.76] P:2034.48 E:0.094116 |  but there was Brodaça, just read it very, very well, the 29-year-old.
[769.76 - 771.96] P:2046.24 E:0.091360 |  Only a couple of caps for Turkey,
[771.96 - 774.68] P:2007.48 E:0.071101 |  and in fact, they were both in there in June,
[774.68 - 779.52] P:2001.30 E:0.092496 |  but it was excellent reading as the ball goes back and the Slera clears it long,
[779.52 - 781.52] P:1944.99 E:0.089103 |  first-time right foot of the way downfield.
[781.52 - 783.36] P:1962.01 E:0.089775 |  Amrabat will like to get forward,
[783.36 - 785.88] P:2011.29 E:0.086720 |  he'll roam inside from that left-back roll,
[785.88 - 790.04] P:1972.96 E:0.089595 |  and it was his header off his bald head that is collected, though, by Galatasaray,
[790.04 - 791.44] P:2020.89 E:0.071434 |  Davison Sanchez.
[791.44 - 794.44] P:2008.44 E:0.095562 |  Don Castellip Crawley by Goulton Hill in league two.
[794.48 - 797.96] P:1981.89 E:0.086853 |  Hannibal lays it off, Casamiro slices the ball forward,
[797.96 - 801.84] P:1931.16 E:0.084146 |  and then it's with Galatasaray, Bué brings it under control,
[801.84 - 805.72] P:1968.36 E:0.091554 |  a cushion touch, a carding with a little layoff back onto the halfway line,
[805.72 - 808.20] P:1970.72 E:0.096051 |  now with Terera, interception though from Hoyland,
[808.20 - 810.04] P:2038.88 E:0.097115 |  early ball from Casamiro,
[810.04 - 813.32] P:2050.57 E:0.100292 |  Bruna Fernandez now has it, floats the ball out towards Rashford,
[813.32 - 816.36] P:2096.51 E:0.099332 |  hardly seen anything of Rashford, 13 minutes into this game,
[816.36 - 818.36] P:2085.60 E:0.114963 |  but now left-hand side of the penalty area,
[818.36 - 820.68] P:2085.69 E:0.085232 |  Mount makes the run ahead in, tries the cut back,
[820.68 - 823.64] P:2022.40 E:0.066824 |  and it's cleared away by Karn, Ihan.
[823.64 - 826.88] P:2002.06 E:0.090926 |  United get it back once again, not holding onto the ball at the moment,
[826.88 - 830.96] P:2059.88 E:0.107813 |  Galatasaray very well, Casamiro steps forward, scoops it towards Hannibal,
[830.96 - 834.48] P:2105.13 E:0.101683 |  Flag stays down, Hannibal's first touch, it was always going away from him,
[834.48 - 837.56] P:2022.01 E:0.093012 |  he's kept the ball alive and in play, plays it back, Rashford,
[837.56 - 839.52] P:2087.95 E:0.096057 |  left-hand side from Manchester United,
[839.52 - 842.00] P:2168.35 E:0.110555 |  in towards Hannibal once again, down towards the bioline,
[842.00 - 844.96] P:2084.60 E:0.098810 |  Sanchez closes him down, corner kick to Manchester United.
[844.96 - 848.28] P:2065.91 E:0.093799 |  Yeah, excellent passage of play from Manchester United,
[848.28 - 851.88] P:2050.86 E:0.091548 |  it's Hannibal making the forward run, it was Mason Mount moments earlier,
[851.92 - 855.92] P:2022.78 E:0.096943 |  both getting into that bioline position, looking for the cut back,
[855.92 - 859.88] P:2077.39 E:0.097661 |  both deflected, but really good intent from Manchester United going forwards.
[860.60 - 863.08] P:2249.32 E:0.113933 |  So Manchester United in their red shirts and black shorts,
[863.08 - 865.56] P:2210.43 E:0.108337 |  playing from left to right, have the corner on the left-hand side,
[865.56 - 869.60] P:2286.22 E:0.097663 |  it's taken short, Mount then to Rashford, back out it goes to Bruna Fernandez,
[869.60 - 872.56] P:2180.49 E:0.101919 |  Fernandez waits to deliver the cross, it's an in-swinging ball,
[872.56 - 876.36] P:2046.73 E:0.080962 |  Moslera punches the ball away, collected by Darlo,
[876.36 - 879.76] P:2058.56 E:0.102212 |  just outside the centre-circle, back out towards Hannibal on the right,
[879.80 - 883.64] P:1998.24 E:0.083746 |  Hannibal now sends over the cross, that was headed out by Ahan,
[883.64 - 888.84] P:2069.85 E:0.085494 |  now towards Zaha, Zaha didn't have much support,
[888.84 - 892.72] P:2077.84 E:0.085329 |  but Aksa Ulu tries to carry it forward,
[892.72 - 894.68] P:2036.09 E:0.097429 |  Casemiro snuffed out of his threat,
[894.68 - 897.60] P:1968.89 E:0.086136 |  but it goes in favour of Galatasaray for a throw.
[897.60 - 903.28] P:2011.98 E:0.073708 |  Using all of his Champions League experience, Casemiro putting out the fire again,
[903.28 - 906.56] P:2030.55 E:0.081559 |  as I said earlier, just sweeping up the transition off the corner,
[907.44 - 911.04] P:2046.42 E:0.090156 |  relieving any pressure that Galatasaray getting a little bit of a sniff,
[911.04 - 914.56] P:1915.20 E:0.084531 |  as Manchester United's attacking set pieces break down.
[915.56 - 920.40] P:1969.50 E:0.100157 |  He made his Champions League debut actually against Galatasaray in November 2013
[920.40 - 921.76] P:1977.55 E:0.091566 |  for Real Madrid,
[923.04 - 925.96] P:2044.34 E:0.093830 |  five Champions League names, of course,
[925.96 - 929.80] P:2037.30 E:0.096109 |  to his long list of major honours in his illustrious career
[929.80 - 932.56] P:2003.60 E:0.076072 |  for the Brazilian international.
[932.56 - 935.24] P:2018.98 E:0.094196 |  There's been a goal in longs, Alistair Broussbal.
[935.72 - 939.28] P:1892.11 E:0.112989 |  Arsenal have certainly settled now, they lead by a goal to nil,
[939.28 - 940.20] P:1814.70 E:0.106516 |  gifted it really,
[940.20 - 942.32] P:1829.15 E:0.111477 |  longs given the ball away inside their own half,
[942.32 - 945.92] P:2060.07 E:0.103805 |  but Kaio Saka immediately spotted Gabriel J. Zouce to his left,
[945.92 - 947.96] P:2018.35 E:0.099610 |  nice touch to work it onto his right foot,
[947.96 - 949.72] P:1916.71 E:0.122490 |  and he drilled the shot into the bottom corner,
[949.72 - 951.12] P:2053.16 E:0.101435 |  longs, then Arsenal won.
[951.12 - 954.08] P:2100.71 E:0.102338 |  Manchester United are attacking with Mount out towards Rashford,
[954.08 - 956.20] P:2065.03 E:0.104380 |  Rashford on that left-hand side, cuts in field,
[956.20 - 958.68] P:2054.77 E:0.102677 |  can't get a sight of goal, back towards Amrabat,
[958.68 - 960.60] P:2084.09 E:0.095512 |  toe into the ball out towards Hannibal,
[960.60 - 962.44] P:2221.17 E:0.106743 |  Darlo decides to come forward as well,
[962.44 - 965.36] P:2285.58 E:0.095953 |  so Arsenal looking to build on that excellent opening win
[965.36 - 969.00] P:2078.56 E:0.083928 |  against PSV on matchday one, Manchester United,
[969.00 - 972.36] P:2067.04 E:0.096113 |  they've got some work to do after that defeat in Munich to Bayern,
[972.36 - 974.52] P:2173.81 E:0.096362 |  crew one, Jillingham Nill is the latest scoring lead,
[974.52 - 976.04] P:2106.93 E:0.090802 |  two, and in the championship,
[976.04 - 978.96] P:1961.37 E:0.102779 |  West Brom and Chalvin lead Sheffield Wednesday by a goal to nil,
[978.96 - 982.80] P:1994.17 E:0.093699 |  West Brom unbeaten in four, Sheffield Wednesday still without a win,
[982.80 - 985.16] P:2035.27 E:0.081358 |  struggling in the championship,
[985.16 - 988.28] P:2031.76 E:0.079934 |  just two points after their opening, nine games.
[988.28 - 989.88] P:1965.53 E:0.082197 |  16 minutes played, nil-nil.
[990.88 - 994.08] P:2016.80 E:0.078323 |  The slayer to Badaccia.
[994.08 - 998.76] P:1989.24 E:0.085339 |  Badaccia is complaining that there was no out ball on this near side to left,
[998.76 - 1002.20] P:2033.10 E:0.080737 |  because Angelinho had gone in field in that inverted role,
[1002.20 - 1004.20] P:1937.12 E:0.084097 |  and Zaha was the one who had to come short.
[1004.20 - 1006.80] P:1940.39 E:0.079844 |  It's called fashion deno, full-back going inside.
[1006.80 - 1008.40] P:1959.16 E:0.066077 |  Have you ever done it?
[1008.40 - 1010.16] P:1952.87 E:0.090675 |  I thought you would ask me about fashion.
[1010.16 - 1013.44] P:1971.17 E:0.081866 |  It's going to save, you've never seen my attire.
[1013.44 - 1016.44] P:2045.73 E:0.108453 |  Ball over the top towards Rashford, flag stays down,
[1016.44 - 1018.80] P:2010.71 E:0.103772 |  I thought Rashford was coming back from an offside position,
[1018.84 - 1022.72] P:2097.99 E:0.113760 |  Rashford now with a cross, and the header in by Hoiland,
[1022.72 - 1026.80] P:2068.32 E:0.113509 |  and the flag stays down, and Hoiland has scored his first goal at Old Trafford,
[1026.80 - 1029.80] P:2035.93 E:0.105976 |  and Manchester United lead by a goal to nil,
[1029.80 - 1032.44] P:2070.66 E:0.099350 |  swift counter-attack by Manchester United,
[1032.44 - 1034.04] P:2068.40 E:0.109754 |  Rashford did ever so well,
[1034.04 - 1036.60] P:2096.48 E:0.104526 |  and Hoiland with a header gives United a lead.
[1037.80 - 1042.76] P:2058.75 E:0.100034 |  Easy as anything for Manchester United to get over the top of Galatasaray,
[1042.76 - 1047.60] P:2033.74 E:0.098380 |  but I tell you what, Marcus Rashford in that position.
[1047.60 - 1050.84] P:2041.54 E:0.092008 |  I've had questions, can he add assist to his game?
[1050.84 - 1052.28] P:1962.47 E:0.081246 |  Can he add more goals?
[1052.28 - 1057.60] P:1957.89 E:0.092907 |  And this assist for Hoiland is absolutely marvellous,
[1057.60 - 1059.64] P:2012.90 E:0.089620 |  ruthless, precise.
[1060.64 - 1062.44] P:2058.15 E:0.100815 |  The header was just exquisite,
[1062.44 - 1064.56] P:1970.36 E:0.090673 |  and you can just see on the replay,
[1064.56 - 1068.96] P:2021.89 E:0.084312 |  Marcus Rashford all alone, no-one marking him tight.
[1068.96 - 1071.92] P:2004.60 E:0.107082 |  There's a VAR check, that was why the booze and the groans.
[1071.92 - 1074.52] P:2065.42 E:0.098042 |  I thought, to my natural, I thought he was coming back
[1074.52 - 1076.48] P:2035.78 E:0.085325 |  from an offside position at the time.
[1076.48 - 1079.20] P:2027.67 E:0.098007 |  Said it in the commentary, but looking at it again,
[1079.20 - 1082.16] P:2043.36 E:0.096885 |  Sanchez might just have been playing him onside.
[1084.80 - 1088.88] P:2098.81 E:0.108212 |  Well, he had a check, and the goal stands,
[1088.88 - 1091.84] P:2058.71 E:0.102685 |  and Manchester United do lead by a goal to nil.
[1091.84 - 1093.76] P:2062.21 E:0.117994 |  And there's been a goal elsewhere in the Premier League,
[1093.76 - 1095.76] P:2079.42 E:0.101655 |  and it's the Kenilworth road, Chris Coles.
[1095.76 - 1098.36] P:1894.66 E:0.118269 |  What an important goal this could be for Burnley,
[1098.36 - 1100.88] P:2024.73 E:0.100188 |  who have a first half stoppage time, lead over Luton,
[1100.88 - 1104.72] P:2023.42 E:0.091684 |  Lyle Foster back from suspension, back with a big goal for his team,
[1104.76 - 1106.96] P:2082.93 E:0.086448 |  clean through, shrugged off Tom Lockyer,
[1106.96 - 1111.16] P:2006.04 E:0.092817 |  and slid under Thomas Kaminski to make it Luton nil, Burnley won.
[1111.16 - 1114.40] P:2034.30 E:0.113174 |  Burnley, who are yet to win this season, just one point.
[1116.20 - 1118.36] P:1988.29 E:0.116952 |  I think Terere is still complaining.
[1118.36 - 1120.24] P:1901.84 E:0.100647 |  He might have spoken a little bit out of turn,
[1120.24 - 1122.28] P:1988.98 E:0.089912 |  then, to the Slovakian referee,
[1122.28 - 1125.28] P:2005.44 E:0.103959 |  but Euland, after 17 minutes, has given the lead.
[1127.12 - 1130.12] P:2050.93 E:0.085705 |  It was a quick check,
[1130.12 - 1132.28] P:1943.19 E:0.109395 |  but I think Sanchez was probably looking at it again,
[1132.28 - 1133.36] P:1919.29 E:0.090659 |  playing him onside.
[1133.36 - 1135.96] P:2012.53 E:0.096549 |  We don't want to talk about tight VAO calls, then, eh?
[1137.16 - 1139.36] P:1973.78 E:0.116402 |  Well, it was probably about another 30-odd seconds,
[1139.36 - 1140.48] P:2029.85 E:0.087682 |  as it was at Tottenham,
[1140.48 - 1141.48] P:2053.29 E:0.102030 |  but...
[1142.24 - 1144.88] P:2056.49 E:0.099279 |  ...Voiland, who scored against Bayern,
[1144.88 - 1147.04] P:2027.60 E:0.109532 |  still yet to score in the Premier League,
[1147.04 - 1150.08] P:2058.25 E:0.097444 |  but his first goal at Old Trafford,
[1150.08 - 1155.20] P:2012.94 E:0.090822 |  as Zaha is just having a little bit of a...
[1156.48 - 1158.08] P:1972.82 E:0.097293 |  ..of a niggle with Hannibal,
[1158.08 - 1160.72] P:2053.87 E:0.095998 |  just a little push in the chest of Hannibal,
[1160.72 - 1162.56] P:1947.18 E:0.079799 |  and the referee telling him to cut it out.
[1163.56 - 1166.80] P:1891.24 E:0.109577 |  That was a strong challenge on Sanchez, on Mason Mount,
[1166.80 - 1169.80] P:2011.03 E:0.089706 |  good old 50-50, and it goes to that far side.
[1169.80 - 1171.92] P:2020.67 E:0.106586 |  Rashford, then, with the assist, picks the ball up,
[1171.92 - 1174.16] P:2004.73 E:0.094974 |  keeps the ball in play on that left-hand side.
[1175.28 - 1179.12] P:2069.95 E:0.102355 |  The cross goes in, and Mislare claims it high,
[1179.12 - 1181.80] P:2044.59 E:0.094622 |  just above his head, away towards our right.
[1181.80 - 1184.88] P:2013.90 E:0.093511 |  That should settle any anxieties for Manchester United, do you think?
[1184.88 - 1187.84] P:2010.52 E:0.094194 |  It's definitely settled them, but it's also kicked them again.
[1187.84 - 1189.20] P:1740.75 E:0.110197 |  They really want another goal.
[1189.20 - 1192.08] P:2055.73 E:0.087271 |  You could just see, after winning that free kick moments earlier,
[1192.08 - 1195.00] P:1981.21 E:0.082177 |  Casamira has gone for the quick one, straight into Mason Mount.
[1195.00 - 1196.48] P:1996.24 E:0.088970 |  The referee has actually pulled it back,
[1196.48 - 1198.80] P:2042.55 E:0.077133 |  but that just gives you an indication
[1198.80 - 1200.32] P:1971.02 E:0.098428 |  of what Manchester United are planning here.
[1200.32 - 1201.84] P:1955.72 E:0.064846 |  They want that second.
[1201.84 - 1203.92] P:1975.86 E:0.103406 |  Ball goes back to Mislare.
[1203.92 - 1206.88] P:1898.12 E:0.096386 |  They've never won in England in all of their previous ten trips
[1206.88 - 1207.72] P:1996.32 E:0.088974 |  to this country.
[1207.72 - 1209.36] P:1946.89 E:0.095558 |  They've drawn three and lost seven,
[1209.36 - 1212.80] P:1926.56 E:0.101807 |  and Galatasaray find themselves behind in this gaming group A
[1212.80 - 1214.00] P:1924.43 E:0.108298 |  in the Champions League.
[1214.00 - 1216.48] P:1951.31 E:0.101518 |  Arsenal are leading in France by a goal to nil,
[1216.48 - 1218.16] P:1913.94 E:0.106823 |  and it's half-time now in the Premier League.
[1218.16 - 1219.28] P:2031.62 E:0.082423 |  Chris Coles.
[1219.36 - 1220.64] P:1932.36 E:0.104924 |  Plus half of football.
[1220.64 - 1222.20] P:1900.79 E:0.106775 |  Proper harem, scaram stuff.
[1222.20 - 1223.44] P:1831.69 E:0.104350 |  Luton nil, Burnley won.
[1223.44 - 1225.20] P:1923.22 E:0.094566 |  The list of chances lengthy for both.
[1225.20 - 1227.96] P:2016.86 E:0.096477 |  Lyle Foster finally taking one for the visitors
[1227.96 - 1229.24] P:1993.97 E:0.091998 |  in first half-stoppage time.
[1229.24 - 1229.96] P:2011.41 E:0.076168 |  Good finish.
[1229.96 - 1232.76] P:2034.87 E:0.104709 |  Jadossi Ogbeni, heading Luton's best chance just wide.
[1232.76 - 1235.00] P:2021.29 E:0.103347 |  Luton nil, Burnley won.
[1235.00 - 1236.44] P:2081.67 E:0.118481 |  Newport nil, Colchester won.
[1236.44 - 1237.72] P:2033.99 E:0.105649 |  Cambridge nil, Barnsley two,
[1237.72 - 1239.36] P:1994.67 E:0.122203 |  a latest scores in the Football League.
[1239.36 - 1240.28] P:2048.80 E:0.116541 |  Forward ball to Hoiland.
[1240.28 - 1241.88] P:1989.17 E:0.120033 |  Mislare is out of his penalty area,
[1241.88 - 1244.44] P:2046.79 E:0.092424 |  and just about gets the touch from his feet,
[1244.44 - 1246.60] P:2063.75 E:0.114211 |  and takes it the other side of Hoiland,
[1246.60 - 1248.92] P:2024.45 E:0.091423 |  who'd made the run to the left of the keeper.
[1248.96 - 1250.24] P:1964.08 E:0.105314 |  The ball went to the right,
[1250.24 - 1252.64] P:2075.38 E:0.086293 |  and then, I think it was Badaccia,
[1252.64 - 1254.12] P:2001.19 E:0.084486 |  who gave it back to the keeper.
[1254.12 - 1255.64] P:2065.09 E:0.094373 |  He'd only just got back to his speed, he didn't.
[1255.64 - 1257.32] P:1953.68 E:0.086074 |  Well, it was like a hot potato.
[1257.32 - 1259.36] P:2051.42 E:0.115015 |  I'll tell you what, that ball through
[1259.36 - 1262.52] P:2058.48 E:0.104726 |  with the outside of his foot from Mason Mow,
[1262.52 - 1263.44] P:1985.18 E:0.113009 |  was exceptional.
[1263.44 - 1265.44] P:1919.40 E:0.111651 |  The run from Hoiland, just playing on the back line,
[1265.44 - 1267.56] P:1920.16 E:0.099352 |  it's been a feature in the game so far.
[1267.56 - 1270.36] P:1970.29 E:0.084530 |  Hoiland just on the back shoulder of Davison Sanchez.
[1270.36 - 1273.28] P:1949.68 E:0.090642 |  The ball fed on the angle into Hoiland,
[1273.28 - 1276.28] P:1939.72 E:0.082186 |  and he was inches away from Tone, it passed the goalkeeper,
[1276.28 - 1278.76] P:1946.94 E:0.079728 |  and he would have had an empty net to slot it into.
[1278.80 - 1282.52] P:1902.19 E:0.098260 |  Napoli are leading Real Madrid by a goal to nil in Group C.
[1282.52 - 1284.60] P:1966.06 E:0.105196 |  Earlier in the early a-kick game, in fact,
[1284.60 - 1288.40] P:1967.29 E:0.096530 |  at Union Berlin, who would 2-0 up and home to Sporting Braga,
[1288.40 - 1291.40] P:1987.31 E:0.095498 |  ended up losing that 3-2 to the Portuguese side,
[1291.40 - 1294.00] P:1949.15 E:0.091850 |  and in the other earlier game in Group D,
[1294.00 - 1296.96] P:2007.23 E:0.092795 |  Salzburg nil, Real Sausage had 2.
[1296.96 - 1299.48] P:1974.36 E:0.104256 |  So, Real Sausage had go to four points,
[1299.48 - 1303.36] P:2036.17 E:0.107861 |  Inter and Benfica in San Siro, currently drawing 0-0.
[1303.36 - 1305.08] P:2067.83 E:0.117353 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live,
[1305.08 - 1307.96] P:1996.35 E:0.099035 |  and BBC Sounds were also live on Radio Manchester.
[1308.00 - 1309.48] P:2089.12 E:0.115687 |  Stopport 2, Forrest Green nil,
[1309.48 - 1312.20] P:2031.94 E:0.107575 |  Knox County knee leads Swindon now by 2 goals to nil,
[1312.20 - 1315.28] P:1888.24 E:0.096780 |  also in League 2, as Ihan clears the ball away,
[1315.28 - 1319.08] P:1960.29 E:0.091436 |  high downfield, and then Lindelof will wait for that bouncing ball
[1319.08 - 1322.32] P:1986.66 E:0.095106 |  just to drop towards him, and then he heads it back to Onana.
[1323.04 - 1326.20] P:1839.93 E:0.095144 |  And the underarm throw out to Viran, Casamiro.
[1326.68 - 1329.80] P:1962.66 E:0.084094 |  Fullbacks are pushed on, aren't they, for Manchester United?
[1331.16 - 1333.76] P:1911.29 E:0.112252 |  The ball cleared long by Onana, Hannibal heads it on,
[1333.76 - 1336.84] P:2033.89 E:0.094024 |  looking towards Hoiland, Sanchez with a back pass.
[1336.84 - 1340.12] P:2030.43 E:0.091572 |  Hoiland continues to run to Mislera, the Uruguayan keeper,
[1340.12 - 1343.04] P:1949.85 E:0.086542 |  finds Angelinho, and now it's with Badaccia.
[1343.68 - 1346.76] P:1914.22 E:0.096046 |  Angelinho takes over for Galatasaray,
[1347.24 - 1350.04] P:1983.66 E:0.088491 |  who, unbeaten since the end of April,
[1350.04 - 1352.48] P:2014.20 E:0.095831 |  when they lost to Besiktas, the Turkish champions,
[1352.48 - 1356.40] P:2036.22 E:0.101006 |  the ball is hit long by Devison Sanchez up towards Zaha.
[1356.40 - 1359.92] P:2101.51 E:0.113487 |  Zaha uses strength down into the ground, and Zaha is equalised.
[1360.36 - 1364.20] P:2027.57 E:0.113750 |  Manchester United never dealt with a threat of Wilfred Zaha,
[1365.16 - 1368.16] P:2067.73 E:0.110621 |  and he's scored an ultrapan against his former club,
[1368.16 - 1372.20] P:1992.37 E:0.106667 |  right-footed, over the despairing dive of Onana.
[1372.20 - 1377.04] P:2017.23 E:0.112803 |  Galatasaray with the equaliser, Wilfred Zaha making his mark, 1-1.
[1377.04 - 1379.64] P:1972.48 E:0.085952 |  Well, it's been all Manchester United,
[1379.64 - 1384.40] P:1878.41 E:0.100263 |  but I tell you what, this is really poor defending from Diogo Dallo.
[1384.40 - 1387.56] P:2022.82 E:0.086837 |  The ball is bouncing, and it's just sheer strength.
[1387.56 - 1391.24] P:1981.52 E:0.104181 |  Zaha just holds him off and allows the ball to keep bouncing into the box,
[1391.24 - 1394.68] P:1979.35 E:0.094510 |  and Onana is nowhere to be seen inside the Manchester United goal.
[1394.68 - 1398.92] P:2000.29 E:0.090290 |  Zaha has just flicked a leg at it, the ball is bounced off the floor,
[1398.92 - 1401.08] P:1992.61 E:0.104764 |  over the top of Onana, he's got no chance,
[1401.08 - 1403.32] P:1899.86 E:0.087928 |  because it's actually deflected off Dallo.
[1404.68 - 1407.80] P:1968.45 E:0.094506 |  And it's gone into the back of the net completely against the run of play.
[1407.80 - 1409.96] P:1929.44 E:0.098970 |  Should Dallo have been stronger in that instance?
[1409.96 - 1412.28] P:1966.79 E:0.095979 |  Absolutely, I'm just watching the replay.
[1412.28 - 1415.36] P:1971.70 E:0.101657 |  Zaha is leaning into him, Dallo is leaning into him as well,
[1415.36 - 1418.48] P:1984.97 E:0.083156 |  but it's just this little touch, he gets a touch on it,
[1418.52 - 1423.24] P:1968.69 E:0.097696 |  and Zaha kind of, scissor kicks it on the half-move, on the half-turn, sorry.
[1423.24 - 1426.36] P:1960.61 E:0.103294 |  And Dallo just can't deal with the sheer strength of Zaha.
[1427.36 - 1429.28] P:1984.41 E:0.107698 |  I would say it's a good finish, but it's not really,
[1429.28 - 1433.64] P:1949.40 E:0.100240 |  it's just deflected over the top of Onana, but the goal is just pure endeavour.
[1434.84 - 1439.96] P:1956.63 E:0.101193 |  And Zaha, who once scored two goals in a win for Crystal Palace here,
[1441.08 - 1446.00] P:2003.06 E:0.090746 |  in 2020, it was a 3-1 success for Crystal Palace,
[1446.04 - 1450.04] P:1991.98 E:0.096984 |  that means that it's three goals in seven at Adol Trafford.
[1450.04 - 1454.32] P:2003.31 E:0.091964 |  But he scored and he's first start at the weekend against Ankara,
[1454.32 - 1459.60] P:2036.59 E:0.087440 |  he's scored in successive games, and the word bedlam springs to mind
[1459.60 - 1463.28] P:1946.55 E:0.103110 |  when I look away towards that ride and that travelling support of Galatasaray
[1463.28 - 1466.12] P:1971.77 E:0.086431 |  and that quadrant as Tete runs forward,
[1466.12 - 1471.20] P:2009.78 E:0.101723 |  and really out of nothing, Galatasaray have levelled that Sanchez ball out of defence,
[1471.20 - 1474.52] P:2052.56 E:0.096486 |  Zaha's onto it, never dealt with it, Manchester United.
[1474.52 - 1479.52] P:2045.48 E:0.091430 |  And these are the moments now, Deno, where I have big questions over this Manchester United team,
[1479.52 - 1482.68] P:1956.81 E:0.083972 |  not because of the personnel, but just the mentality,
[1482.68 - 1487.12] P:2009.69 E:0.091387 |  and how can they manage this now, they were in full control up until a couple of minutes ago,
[1487.12 - 1488.60] P:2044.51 E:0.067880 |  how do they react?
[1489.40 - 1494.24] P:1982.65 E:0.103414 |  Well, 1-1 Arsenal, remember a leading against Lawns via a goal to Niel,
[1495.12 - 1500.16] P:2025.38 E:0.097700 |  Copenhagen and Bayern, which is also in Manchester United's group, Groupay,
[1500.16 - 1501.56] P:1956.53 E:0.093020 |  that is Niel Niel.
[1501.92 - 1505.64] P:1903.73 E:0.098668 |  I think I'm right in saying that last year Copenhagen drew every game at home,
[1505.64 - 1509.12] P:2024.60 E:0.089201 |  including against Manchester City, they're a tough side to play against
[1509.12 - 1514.12] P:1934.95 E:0.093217 |  on their own soil in Denmark, and also in Arsenal's group in Group B,
[1514.12 - 1519.52] P:1959.67 E:0.093605 |  it's still no goals in Eindhoven, and the Phillips Stadio in between PSV and Sevilla.
[1519.52 - 1522.72] P:2052.45 E:0.102574 |  Knox County have got a third goal at home to Swindon, that's 3-0,
[1522.72 - 1525.56] P:2095.50 E:0.105473 |  Grimsby lead Barrow by a goal to Niel, Northampton 2,
[1525.56 - 1528.80] P:2063.56 E:0.093558 |  Redding Niel is a latest score in League 1.
[1528.84 - 1531.32] P:1888.82 E:0.110038 |  1-1 here in our commentary game, Adol Trafford,
[1531.32 - 1536.08] P:1961.93 E:0.097301 |  the ball spread out and intercepted from Dallow, Casamiro looks to hit it early
[1536.08 - 1539.64] P:2018.68 E:0.096777 |  towards Bruno Fernandez, Angelino will tie it back,
[1539.64 - 1542.72] P:1960.88 E:0.098883 |  and then all the way to Mislera, and he clears it away.
[1542.72 - 1547.12] P:1964.25 E:0.081624 |  I thought he was in, Casamiro, ball around the corner,
[1547.12 - 1552.28] P:1997.92 E:0.084337 |  straight in between Angelino and a centre-back for the run of Bruno Fernandez going for,
[1552.28 - 1555.72] P:1955.91 E:0.089683 |  and I actually thought he was in, but it was exceptional defending again from Angelino.
[1556.60 - 1560.52] P:1900.87 E:0.092262 |  The thing is, when you look at Manchester United, essentially they are a counter-attacking side.
[1560.52 - 1563.76] P:1928.95 E:0.087944 |  If teams sit off, they struggle to break teams down,
[1563.76 - 1567.32] P:1902.65 E:0.090125 |  and the way that Bruno Fernandez is playing quite high up on this right-hand side,
[1567.32 - 1569.80] P:1922.94 E:0.103585 |  they're looking for that early ball for the run of their captain, aren't they?
[1569.80 - 1574.52] P:2001.27 E:0.098126 |  Absolutely. Not just Bruno Fernandez, Rashford and Hoyland as well.
[1574.52 - 1578.44] P:1986.38 E:0.112021 |  Here is Rashford, stopped by the run of Bué, referee's played the advantage,
[1578.44 - 1582.20] P:2028.04 E:0.088087 |  Casamiro, shot takes an inflection, and just goes wide.
[1582.20 - 1584.88] P:2068.65 E:0.101319 |  That could have gone anywhere, because Mislera was stranded.
[1584.96 - 1588.92] P:2031.69 E:0.094651 |  He watched him almost despair as he looked towards his left,
[1588.92 - 1591.20] P:2065.03 E:0.090900 |  wondering where that ball was going to drop to.
[1591.20 - 1594.04] P:2099.47 E:0.109565 |  There's been another goal in Lans, Alastair Bruce Ball.
[1594.04 - 1598.20] P:2034.04 E:0.117529 |  It's an equaliser for the home team, Lanswain Arsenal, one young Frenchman,
[1598.20 - 1602.08] P:2034.40 E:0.111524 |  Adrien Thomason, finishing quite brilliantly after the centre-forward,
[1602.08 - 1606.36] P:2129.27 E:0.096987 |  L.E.A.Y., he chested down and acrobatically flicked it across to him,
[1606.36 - 1609.92] P:2173.88 E:0.097116 |  and then Thomason with his right foot, just guiding the ball on the bounce
[1609.92 - 1613.96] P:2134.43 E:0.100874 |  past the outstretched hand of David Rea. Lanswain Arsenal, one.
[1613.96 - 1614.96] P:2237.34 E:0.107939 |  Thank you, Ali.
[1616.64 - 1620.36] P:2234.42 E:0.116376 |  1-1 in the commentary game here at Old Trafford, Manchester United have a...
[1621.12 - 1624.00] P:2152.65 E:0.110619 |  Corner kick, right-hand side, Bruno Fernandez with the out-swinger,
[1624.00 - 1626.96] P:1987.33 E:0.090673 |  attacked by Sanchez, must have gone out and come back in.
[1626.96 - 1632.20] P:1952.90 E:0.088376 |  The referee's blown his whistle, and it will be a goal kick to Galatasaray.
[1633.36 - 1637.20] P:1930.39 E:0.075603 |  So, Okamburak side, a back level.
[1637.20 - 1640.12] P:1978.21 E:0.101861 |  Manchester United, there will be an element of frustration on that bench
[1640.12 - 1642.16] P:1928.44 E:0.079325 |  of Eric Tenhargik, is he Christensen?
[1642.16 - 1648.36] P:1955.85 E:0.088734 |  Yeah, absolutely, this has been a familiar feeling here at Old Trafford this season.
[1648.36 - 1651.04] P:1963.21 E:0.101255 |  Across Manchester United that they've been shocked,
[1651.04 - 1654.12] P:1851.47 E:0.087828 |  they think they've started the game right, and they had, but they've just been shocked,
[1654.12 - 1657.24] P:1926.67 E:0.088731 |  and that is a reminder that push for that second goal,
[1657.24 - 1659.76] P:1932.05 E:0.087834 |  especially in Champions League, is so important.
[1659.76 - 1662.88] P:1844.32 E:0.096134 |  The rain has returned here in Manchester,
[1662.88 - 1667.12] P:1818.11 E:0.096365 |  as the ball is headed away by Davison Sanchez,
[1667.12 - 1670.72] P:1943.25 E:0.083381 |  9.5 million Euro signed from Tottenham,
[1670.76 - 1674.60] P:1895.25 E:0.100108 |  after he had just started his seventh season in London,
[1674.60 - 1678.32] P:1966.08 E:0.089901 |  just over 200 appearances that he made for Tottenham Hotspur.
[1678.32 - 1680.88] P:2037.46 E:0.093434 |  There's Lindelof to Casamiro, who turns,
[1680.88 - 1684.24] P:2029.43 E:0.101105 |  he's put that ball, he's going to be fouled there for a free kick,
[1684.24 - 1686.88] P:1929.75 E:0.075739 |  it was a challenge coming in from Tesse,
[1686.88 - 1689.56] P:1974.54 E:0.094494 |  14 appearances he made for Leicester last season,
[1689.56 - 1693.48] P:1953.72 E:0.103775 |  five players who played in the Premier League in the Galatasaray,
[1693.48 - 1695.56] P:2000.99 E:0.080313 |  starting 11.
[1695.56 - 1698.60] P:1987.34 E:0.091448 |  1-1, as it is in France between Lons and Arsenal.
[1701.12 - 1706.32] P:1877.93 E:0.102274 |  Now, to Renshel Reign, driving down as a squinting Casamiro,
[1708.20 - 1711.24] P:1957.54 E:0.101065 |  pulls that ball out of play for a throw,
[1711.24 - 1713.44] P:1916.86 E:0.093875 |  so it's a throw to Galatasaray.
[1713.44 - 1715.60] P:1980.22 E:0.103661 |  Ipswich were leading Hull City by a goal to Nill,
[1715.60 - 1717.56] P:1833.49 E:0.099616 |  but there's been another goal at Portman Road, Aaron Paul.
[1717.56 - 1722.60] P:1985.98 E:0.104468 |  Ipswich 2, Hull City 0, it's another stunning strike from Kieran McEnany's side,
[1722.60 - 1724.12] P:1952.57 E:0.110026 |  ball played from left to right,
[1724.12 - 1727.32] P:1986.93 E:0.103066 |  and there is Connor Chaplin just inside the D
[1727.32 - 1730.20] P:1894.43 E:0.101909 |  to curl past the goalkeeper into the top corner of the net.
[1730.24 - 1732.08] P:1989.96 E:0.099132 |  Ipswich 2, Hull City now.
[1732.08 - 1735.16] P:1938.45 E:0.090517 |  But by the end of Hull City's eight-match unbeaten run,
[1735.16 - 1737.76] P:2013.22 E:0.082145 |  and it would take Ipswich to the top tonight,
[1737.76 - 1740.64] P:1989.88 E:0.085858 |  if it was to stay like that, cross swung over from Angelinho,
[1740.64 - 1744.48] P:1951.84 E:0.104130 |  cleared away by Casamiro, round the trigger, equalised in Naples,
[1744.48 - 1748.16] P:1975.84 E:0.106908 |  Napoli won, round the dribb one, here is Hoyland, who gave United the lead,
[1748.16 - 1750.52] P:2019.26 E:0.119948 |  got to go it alone, holds onto the ball very well,
[1750.52 - 1753.76] P:2046.51 E:0.114132 |  he was met by three White Shirts, excellent play by Hoyland,
[1753.76 - 1756.00] P:2065.07 E:0.109054 |  met by stronger pause to Rashford,
[1756.00 - 1757.36] P:2002.08 E:0.113254 |  Amrabat makes the run ahead of him,
[1757.36 - 1760.12] P:1992.49 E:0.107861 |  Amrabat back towards Mason, down into the ground,
[1760.12 - 1762.24] P:2030.44 E:0.106550 |  took a deflection behind for a corner kick,
[1762.24 - 1764.04] P:2045.58 E:0.103241 |  much better again by Manchester United.
[1764.04 - 1767.28] P:1974.44 E:0.101461 |  Yeah, Hoyland, absolutely fantastic hold-up play,
[1767.28 - 1771.12] P:2021.18 E:0.090025 |  centre-forward play, overlapping full-back in Amrabat in that position,
[1771.12 - 1773.80] P:1917.68 E:0.103670 |  and it was Mount who was there for the cut-back,
[1773.80 - 1777.08] P:2002.41 E:0.102614 |  he failed to get a clean connection on the finish,
[1777.08 - 1779.88] P:2095.59 E:0.105410 |  exceptional play from Hoyland in particular.
[1779.88 - 1783.56] P:2198.77 E:0.109435 |  It was Badaccia who got that telling deflection for a corner kick,
[1783.56 - 1785.36] P:2351.11 E:0.090854 |  far side the left.
[1785.36 - 1787.80] P:2176.52 E:0.114434 |  Fernandez pulls it out towards Rashford,
[1787.80 - 1789.96] P:2067.77 E:0.101104 |  Rashford makes a run in towards the penalty area,
[1789.96 - 1792.32] P:2012.46 E:0.102081 |  the angle is tight, the ball won't go with it,
[1792.32 - 1795.32] P:1978.11 E:0.099694 |  Terreira is the player who can clear it for Galatasaray,
[1795.32 - 1799.64] P:1998.02 E:0.104273 |  Amrabat then slips and he was fouled by Tete,
[1799.64 - 1801.20] P:1965.42 E:0.092632 |  and that'll be a free kick,
[1801.20 - 1804.00] P:1980.52 E:0.083827 |  he's got to be careful for persistent defending, Tete.
[1804.00 - 1806.00] P:1919.81 E:0.095386 |  Yeah, he's a lucky boy, Amrabat.
[1807.68 - 1810.44] P:1882.38 E:0.101859 |  Galatasaray had broken, they had three players around the ball,
[1810.44 - 1813.76] P:2094.53 E:0.084021 |  and Amrabat I think he actually slipped and it looked like he'd been fouled,
[1813.80 - 1815.08] P:2128.04 E:0.096466 |  haven't seen a replay.
[1817.08 - 1818.92] P:2079.44 E:0.106656 |  Galatasaray would have been in then,
[1818.92 - 1821.48] P:2167.59 E:0.088964 |  Tete, yeah, he does hack him down actually.
[1823.28 - 1826.20] P:1928.57 E:0.103922 |  Well, Casemiro this occasion is the...
[1826.20 - 1830.68] P:1961.54 E:0.103347 |  It goes in favour of Casemiro actually,
[1830.68 - 1833.96] P:2028.95 E:0.100380 |  Iqadi pleads his innocence, but he's fouled the Brazilian
[1833.96 - 1835.92] P:2037.66 E:0.091024 |  as he slid into that challenge,
[1835.92 - 1837.60] P:2029.48 E:0.113213 |  so it's a free kick which has been taken.
[1837.60 - 1840.44] P:2079.20 E:0.108808 |  Manchester United, you've just joined us here on Five Live,
[1840.48 - 1844.00] P:2044.37 E:0.101892 |  and BBC sounds have been pegged back by Wilfred Zaha.
[1845.28 - 1847.28] P:2085.19 E:0.113346 |  We've got 15 minutes to go to halftime.
[1847.28 - 1851.16] P:2061.68 E:0.101274 |  Bruno Fernandez is now occupying a position on that far side, the left.
[1853.00 - 1856.32] P:2025.58 E:0.113113 |  He rolls the ball in towards Rashford, lets it run through to Hoyland.
[1856.32 - 1858.84] P:2043.34 E:0.110669 |  Angelinho was tucked in to clear the ball away,
[1858.84 - 1860.92] P:2011.27 E:0.096916 |  good covering from the left back.
[1860.92 - 1863.60] P:2020.21 E:0.099490 |  Dallow now for Manchester United.
[1863.60 - 1867.36] P:1965.04 E:0.103763 |  Zaha gets a block challenge in and it runs out of play for a throw.
[1867.36 - 1869.32] P:2014.42 E:0.080871 |  Dallow wants to take it quickly.
[1869.32 - 1871.04] P:2083.90 E:0.114348 |  Back it goes to Verran.
[1872.04 - 1874.04] P:2176.65 E:0.115609 |  Here is Verran outside the centre-circle,
[1874.04 - 1877.04] P:2192.36 E:0.107761 |  along the ground, Mason mounts, side onto goal, forward ball,
[1877.04 - 1879.28] P:2006.76 E:0.086486 |  layoff by Bruno Fernandez.
[1879.28 - 1882.08] P:1996.53 E:0.109689 |  Torreira tries to win it, momentarily had it,
[1882.08 - 1883.76] P:1859.04 E:0.117996 |  and Torreira's going to get a yellow card
[1883.76 - 1886.48] P:2011.71 E:0.116611 |  for the Slovakian referee for a foul on Casemiro.
[1887.48 - 1891.64] P:2065.03 E:0.092358 |  It's a foul from Torreira, but I tell you what, it's lazy from Bruno Fernandez.
[1891.64 - 1896.24] P:2077.64 E:0.090935 |  Just flicking the ball in central areas, it's such a risk in that area,
[1896.24 - 1898.64] P:1950.57 E:0.090571 |  because Amrabat is the left back from Manchester United,
[1898.64 - 1901.52] P:1962.38 E:0.094402 |  he's coming in field, the space is wide open,
[1901.52 - 1904.56] P:2031.44 E:0.089579 |  and that is such a dangerous area to leave vacant.
[1904.56 - 1906.28] P:1954.20 E:0.095561 |  And you're flicking the ball around centrally,
[1906.28 - 1907.96] P:2014.21 E:0.085937 |  you have to be firm with the passes.
[1909.96 - 1913.36] P:1852.38 E:0.106081 |  Well, you heard the reaction of a supporter in the directors box,
[1913.36 - 1915.24] P:1868.41 E:0.101840 |  who's seen that on the replay.
[1915.24 - 1917.52] P:1868.86 E:0.103753 |  He's going in with his stud showing, isn't he, Torreira?
[1917.52 - 1920.88] P:1859.29 E:0.089936 |  He is. It's lower than what we saw at the weekend,
[1920.88 - 1924.20] P:1918.04 E:0.100197 |  with Curtis Jones, there's less contact on Casemiro.
[1925.08 - 1928.12] P:1933.05 E:0.087303 |  But in the replay, it doesn't look too great,
[1928.12 - 1929.84] P:1893.91 E:0.069055 |  but he's got a yellow card.
[1929.84 - 1932.52] P:1935.90 E:0.103247 |  Yeah, Curtis Jones Liverpool lost that appeal, incidentally,
[1932.52 - 1933.48] P:2023.23 E:0.096065 |  it was an unsuccessful...
[1933.48 - 1935.24] P:1902.11 E:0.096782 |  Curtis Jones had gone over the top of the ball,
[1935.24 - 1936.52] P:1874.21 E:0.093316 |  he hasn't gone over the top of the ball,
[1936.52 - 1939.12] P:2004.41 E:0.100230 |  but he has gone in with his stud showing,
[1939.12 - 1941.08] P:1946.88 E:0.084791 |  and Casemiro's getting treatment,
[1941.08 - 1942.48] P:1964.59 E:0.083892 |  so there's...
[1942.48 - 1945.56] P:1878.24 E:0.083391 |  I mean, VAR would naturally have a look at it,
[1945.56 - 1948.64] P:1983.93 E:0.080945 |  but there's no indication at the moment,
[1948.64 - 1953.12] P:1953.66 E:0.081092 |  so whether that was a check complete, we could only assume so,
[1953.12 - 1955.88] P:1849.25 E:0.089181 |  as it's 1-1 with 13 minutes to go at a half-time.
[1955.92 - 1959.16] P:1992.55 E:0.091791 |  Arsenal have been pegged back, like Manchester United have as well.
[1959.16 - 1961.44] P:2012.48 E:0.085749 |  A reminder tomorrow, commentary.
[1961.44 - 1964.04] P:2006.97 E:0.102300 |  Chris Waddle joining John Murray at St James' Park
[1964.04 - 1966.60] P:2006.01 E:0.082487 |  for what should be a terrific atmosphere
[1966.60 - 1969.52] P:1966.26 E:0.076180 |  for Newcastle United against Paris-Hasimov.
[1969.52 - 1971.12] P:1738.73 E:0.092680 |  And then at the weekend,
[1971.12 - 1973.64] P:1973.07 E:0.093182 |  Burnley Chelsea, second half of Crystal Palace,
[1973.64 - 1977.24] P:1961.24 E:0.088682 |  Nottingham Forest, and then on Sunday, Brighton, Liverpool,
[1977.24 - 1981.04] P:2036.07 E:0.090204 |  and Arsenal Manchester City are our two commentaries on Sunday.
[1981.04 - 1985.16] P:2005.06 E:0.096885 |  Casemiro is back on the field of play,
[1985.24 - 1987.60] P:2008.27 E:0.102870 |  and now there was a blow to the head of Bouet,
[1987.60 - 1990.48] P:1987.81 E:0.081136 |  so that'll be another stoppage of free-kick to Gallatay-Tatharai.
[1990.48 - 1993.80] P:1965.76 E:0.093309 |  And we'll go back and find out how Arsenal are doing in Group B.
[1993.80 - 1995.52] P:2005.39 E:0.080946 |  Alistair Bruceport.
[1995.52 - 1997.12] P:2029.43 E:0.114002 |  13 minutes left in the first half.
[1997.12 - 1999.08] P:1999.96 E:0.113694 |  Lance won Arsenal won.
[1999.08 - 2001.00] P:2043.35 E:0.098776 |  They kind of gifted each other goals.
[2001.00 - 2002.20] P:2041.88 E:0.098171 |  Arsenal took the lead,
[2002.20 - 2006.12] P:1905.21 E:0.101265 |  Bakai Osaka was played the ball by a Lance player inside the Lance half.
[2006.12 - 2008.24] P:2062.54 E:0.117905 |  He fed Gabriel J. Zoussen, he scored,
[2008.24 - 2011.48] P:1847.31 E:0.107848 |  and then David Rea playing out from the back gave the ball away,
[2011.48 - 2014.48] P:1899.96 E:0.102970 |  and it was Adrian Tomasson who finished it off for Lance.
[2014.48 - 2016.20] P:1978.88 E:0.079899 |  Lance won Arsenal won.
[2016.20 - 2020.72] P:2072.43 E:0.106625 |  Merci, Ali, Charlton won, Exeter won, is a latest score in League One.
[2020.72 - 2024.08] P:2066.22 E:0.092045 |  There's been another goal scored on the stroke of halftime in League One.
[2024.08 - 2027.88] P:2030.97 E:0.087844 |  Bristol Roe has got a second at home to Port Vale, so they're 2-0 up,
[2027.88 - 2029.48] P:1811.25 E:0.099143 |  and there are no other goals to tell you about,
[2029.48 - 2032.92] P:2003.51 E:0.089078 |  as the halftime whistles are sounding elsewhere on a busy night
[2032.92 - 2037.04] P:1963.01 E:0.101206 |  in the EFL as a production with a foul,
[2037.04 - 2039.24] P:1966.61 E:0.087781 |  and that'll be a free-kick to Manchester United
[2039.24 - 2042.48] P:1861.69 E:0.096312 |  with about 11 minutes to go of normal time in this first half,
[2042.48 - 2043.80] P:1761.52 E:0.079019 |  just one-one on five-life.
[2043.80 - 2047.32] P:1799.14 E:0.077299 |  Yeah, he would play by Hannibal, just pinning Badaccia.
[2047.32 - 2048.80] P:2092.20 E:0.098045 |  The ball's gone forward into his chest,
[2048.80 - 2052.92] P:1949.42 E:0.070299 |  he just showed real strength to hold him off, get inside a free-kick,
[2052.92 - 2055.80] P:1980.10 E:0.071947 |  work it out again, Manchester United.
[2055.80 - 2057.88] P:1966.81 E:0.105811 |  Amrabat knew that Casamiro,
[2057.88 - 2059.76] P:2129.90 E:0.095301 |  dropping in between the two central defenders,
[2059.76 - 2062.92] P:1940.40 E:0.107744 |  his forward ball is headed away by Sanchez,
[2062.92 - 2071.36] P:1976.63 E:0.092966 |  and then Casamiro's shown a yellow card for a challenge on Axa Conley.
[2071.44 - 2080.64] P:1975.07 E:0.091709 |  Casamiro loose bouncing ball, he's just gone in with speed, with his foot up.
[2080.64 - 2084.24] P:2021.32 E:0.086599 |  Dangerous play.
[2084.24 - 2087.76] P:1952.64 E:0.103763 |  Badaccia takes it, spreads it out towards that far side,
[2087.76 - 2091.28] P:1898.44 E:0.082791 |  that was a precise pass out towards the right, Buoy.
[2091.28 - 2094.96] P:1860.09 E:0.089417 |  Tete now takes over, dropping back midway through the Manchester United half.
[2094.96 - 2100.52] P:1987.47 E:0.095809 |  Sanchez's forward ball, and then Buoy's ball is a little bit too far ahead
[2100.60 - 2103.48] P:1846.45 E:0.097642 |  of the midfielder for Galatasaray.
[2103.48 - 2107.00] P:1895.33 E:0.089895 |  So a Manchester United throw, midway through the half, over on that far side.
[2107.00 - 2110.04] P:1884.73 E:0.091133 |  They're left 10 minutes to go to half-time here, it's one-one.
[2110.04 - 2112.32] P:1992.77 E:0.069832 |  Alistair Bruce-Ball watching Arsenal.
[2112.32 - 2113.72] P:1877.50 E:0.119013 |  Another blow for Arsenal,
[2113.72 - 2116.60] P:1914.02 E:0.111889 |  because Saka's only managed just over half an hour,
[2116.60 - 2119.28] P:1799.92 E:0.116216 |  he's gone off to be replaced by Fabio Villera,
[2119.28 - 2121.96] P:1856.60 E:0.102085 |  seem to be holding the top of his right leg, not the same.
[2121.96 - 2124.80] P:1839.22 E:0.101907 |  I think there's a foot injury that took him off late on against Bournemouth
[2124.80 - 2127.76] P:1909.44 E:0.104374 |  at the weekend, they're obviously playing Manchester City this weekend,
[2127.76 - 2130.20] P:1879.39 E:0.093754 |  our commentary game on Sunday, but Saka off,
[2130.24 - 2132.12] P:1871.47 E:0.113092 |  just after the half-hour mark in this game,
[2132.12 - 2133.36] P:1904.35 E:0.102042 |  launched one Arsenal one.
[2133.36 - 2134.64] P:1996.13 E:0.095147 |  So a concern for Arsenal,
[2134.64 - 2136.56] P:1916.18 E:0.122051 |  and also I would imagine for Gareth Southgate,
[2136.56 - 2139.76] P:2163.97 E:0.103985 |  who names his England squad on Thursday as well,
[2139.76 - 2142.48] P:2238.82 E:0.109447 |  for the fitness concerns of Bacchio Saka.
[2142.48 - 2143.72] P:2132.03 E:0.120951 |  One-one here in Old Trafford,
[2143.72 - 2146.04] P:2126.37 E:0.098631 |  we've got less than 10 minutes to go to half-time.
[2146.04 - 2148.72] P:2196.69 E:0.106110 |  Fernandez finds Lindelof, steps forward out of defence,
[2148.72 - 2151.04] P:2130.27 E:0.101850 |  just outside the centre-circle of his own half.
[2151.04 - 2152.52] P:2134.21 E:0.108357 |  Casamiro under pressure,
[2152.52 - 2156.76] P:2054.80 E:0.099989 |  Akta Colu was sniffing around, out towards Rashford.
[2156.76 - 2158.88] P:2005.46 E:0.098986 |  He waits, closed down by Tete,
[2158.92 - 2161.20] P:1950.21 E:0.092405 |  out of play, it goes for a Manchester United throw.
[2161.20 - 2163.72] P:1953.12 E:0.081339 |  Yeah, I'm just looking at Manchester United's set-up,
[2163.72 - 2168.76] P:1982.85 E:0.081617 |  they look so vulnerable when they're playing with the ball centrally
[2168.76 - 2171.68] P:1945.95 E:0.095652 |  in tight areas, because they've committed Amrabat central,
[2171.68 - 2174.28] P:1905.80 E:0.084067 |  so they've almost got four midfielders playing in the mid,
[2174.28 - 2177.28] P:1933.77 E:0.086246 |  middle of the pitch, the space is so vacant,
[2177.28 - 2180.04] P:1930.02 E:0.081659 |  and it's teasing Galatasaray into the transitions.
[2180.04 - 2182.20] P:1959.94 E:0.092229 |  They've got to be sharper, Manchester United.
[2183.44 - 2186.24] P:1941.03 E:0.105211 |  Real Madrid are now in front in Naples,
[2186.24 - 2187.60] P:1971.13 E:0.103646 |  and Jude Bellingham has scored.
[2187.60 - 2190.72] P:2013.26 E:0.098241 |  What a season he is having since that move to Real Madrid.
[2190.72 - 2196.60] P:1958.77 E:0.091419 |  Napoli won, Real Madrid 2 is a latest score in the Champions League.
[2197.48 - 2201.60] P:1891.99 E:0.091539 |  And here we have nine minutes to go to half-time.
[2202.36 - 2204.92] P:1896.84 E:0.104260 |  Half-time now at Port Monroe in the championship, Aaron Paul.
[2204.92 - 2207.36] P:1924.48 E:0.101925 |  Ipswich 2, Halnell, two quality strikes,
[2207.36 - 2210.80] P:1877.29 E:0.089840 |  either end of the half from Wes Burns and Conor Chaplin.
[2210.80 - 2213.76] P:1862.68 E:0.088274 |  Have Ipswich down top of the championship as things stand?
[2213.76 - 2215.80] P:1873.44 E:0.091110 |  Half-time, Ipswich 2, Halnell.
[2215.84 - 2218.04] P:1898.01 E:0.102766 |  Bruna Fernandez looking for the run of Rashford.
[2218.04 - 2220.16] P:1973.08 E:0.088639 |  There they go on the counterattack once again.
[2220.16 - 2222.64] P:2001.79 E:0.106659 |  Bué holds off Rashford on that far side of the left,
[2222.64 - 2224.48] P:1989.99 E:0.093357 |  level of the penalty area.
[2224.48 - 2227.12] P:2057.12 E:0.107177 |  Bué, who'd been linked with Arsenal, and Brighton and Hove Albion.
[2227.12 - 2230.24] P:1994.71 E:0.099111 |  Back it goes to Fernandez, closed down by Terera,
[2230.24 - 2233.96] P:2045.61 E:0.100743 |  loops a long way up high into the air, drops bouncing ball,
[2233.96 - 2237.56] P:2013.84 E:0.092421 |  but actually waits for it to settle, touches it back to Angelinho,
[2237.56 - 2240.44] P:1996.24 E:0.114330 |  who then along the ground looks towards Zaha, who got the equaliser.
[2240.44 - 2242.88] P:2073.20 E:0.110530 |  Dallo with a sliding challenge.
[2242.92 - 2245.60] P:2045.65 E:0.110557 |  The Ocan Bueruk, the coach, is...
[2247.08 - 2250.24] P:2066.49 E:0.108906 |  ...pleading with the fourth official to show a yellow card.
[2250.24 - 2252.24] P:2036.08 E:0.111430 |  He's going to get it, Dallo.
[2252.24 - 2256.08] P:1969.31 E:0.114440 |  Quite rightly, so is Ocan Bueruk for his actions,
[2256.08 - 2259.44] P:2027.08 E:0.090546 |  because that pressure is something that the officials
[2259.44 - 2261.88] P:1934.23 E:0.104281 |  do not want to see from either a player or indeed a manager.
[2261.88 - 2264.96] P:1957.67 E:0.089300 |  Yeah, we don't want to see that, but it's happened right in front of his technical area.
[2264.96 - 2269.12] P:1943.00 E:0.088772 |  The tackle from Dallo on Zaha. Zaha's really clever.
[2269.12 - 2271.88] P:2039.98 E:0.092806 |  The ball is shaped down the line with Angelinho's left foot,
[2271.88 - 2275.08] P:1937.14 E:0.094858 |  and Zaha has just got himself in between Dallo and the ball,
[2275.08 - 2276.92] P:1944.82 E:0.074479 |  and he's gone to spin him behind,
[2276.92 - 2280.76] P:1939.70 E:0.088458 |  and Dallo has just cleaned him up into Ten Hargs technical area
[2280.76 - 2283.80] P:1936.36 E:0.085213 |  and forced the reaction from his manager, rightly so,
[2283.80 - 2286.16] P:1783.46 E:0.070465 |  but we don't want to see that at all.
[2286.16 - 2289.64] P:1882.22 E:0.100891 |  Message will be quite clear now for Zaha just to keep running at Dallo.
[2289.64 - 2291.24] P:1923.30 E:0.110530 |  He's on depression now on a yellow, isn't he?
[2291.24 - 2297.00] P:2009.02 E:0.092019 |  He is. He's been quiet, Zaha, but when he has come into life...
[2297.00 - 2299.88] P:1995.22 E:0.113552 |  Here is Rashford. Rashford's strong running on the left-hand side,
[2299.88 - 2303.00] P:1982.13 E:0.107060 |  and Zaha's in in low, but that's just as clear as far as Amra bat.
[2303.00 - 2304.36] P:2082.45 E:0.078108 |  Low ball.
[2304.36 - 2308.76] P:2048.12 E:0.099422 |  Fernandez was following it in, but the goalkeeper wasn't going to let that one loose,
[2308.76 - 2311.56] P:1924.53 E:0.098779 |  and he snaffled it up and then threw it out towards Angelinho.
[2311.56 - 2313.64] P:1998.03 E:0.081056 |  He likes to get forward on this near side.
[2313.64 - 2316.84] P:1987.19 E:0.087742 |  15 appearances in his time at Manchester City.
[2316.84 - 2321.88] P:1884.57 E:0.089261 |  Now to Zaha, being booed and jeered by some of the Manchester United fans.
[2321.88 - 2325.08] P:1933.94 E:0.071472 |  He passes the ball forward, back to Oglou.
[2325.08 - 2328.36] P:1852.57 E:0.088912 |  On this left-hand side, back to Angelinho.
[2328.36 - 2330.04] P:1958.85 E:0.075707 |  A stocky figure.
[2330.04 - 2332.56] P:1882.90 E:0.079373 |  Back to Akta Koglu.
[2332.56 - 2335.48] P:1929.25 E:0.104931 |  Challenge from Varan, who's fallen him out of central defence,
[2335.48 - 2337.64] P:1989.85 E:0.091212 |  and he gets the ball, passes it in field,
[2337.64 - 2341.44] P:1987.72 E:0.086835 |  but reading it and stepping a long way forward with Sanchez.
[2341.44 - 2343.52] P:1873.19 E:0.084348 |  Oh, no, no, has it away towards our left.
[2345.28 - 2347.08] P:1906.81 E:0.105169 |  Just looking at that passage of play back.
[2347.08 - 2350.84] P:1896.29 E:0.089444 |  It was a run into Rashford, and Davison Sanchez has just read it
[2350.84 - 2353.08] P:1862.18 E:0.072181 |  and stepped in front of Rashford, but...
[2353.08 - 2355.60] P:1846.68 E:0.093101 |  I'd quite like to see Rashford come and meet that ball.
[2358.60 - 2361.32] P:1979.93 E:0.109979 |  Let's get an update in the Premier League at Kenoweth Road, Chris Coles.
[2361.32 - 2362.72] P:1880.55 E:0.105934 |  Lutonil Burnley won.
[2362.72 - 2365.60] P:1859.63 E:0.092157 |  He thought half-time would kill the frenetic nature of this game.
[2365.60 - 2368.52] P:1961.26 E:0.096538 |  Immediately quashed two good chances for Burnley in the opening minutes
[2368.52 - 2369.40] P:1879.71 E:0.078655 |  of the second half.
[2369.40 - 2372.80] P:1942.13 E:0.092136 |  Lukakuoliocho bursting through, shot well-safe by Thomas Kaminski.
[2372.80 - 2375.44] P:1922.50 E:0.095171 |  He was in action again to deny Josh Brownhill.
[2375.44 - 2377.60] P:1997.45 E:0.083698 |  Lutonil Burnley won.
[2377.60 - 2379.08] P:1957.14 E:0.111245 |  1-1 here at Old Trafford.
[2379.08 - 2381.16] P:2031.38 E:0.104929 |  Arsenal still drawing 1-1 in longs.
[2381.16 - 2383.92] P:1961.92 E:0.101763 |  Amrabat tried a thread of ball through towards Hoiland.
[2384.92 - 2389.48] P:1934.74 E:0.086700 |  Blocks, and then cleared by Terera to Zaha up against Dallow.
[2389.48 - 2390.92] P:1974.90 E:0.098499 |  He's looking for the return ball.
[2390.92 - 2393.36] P:1929.27 E:0.099448 |  Angelina was caught late by Hannibal,
[2393.36 - 2397.44] P:1990.56 E:0.102789 |  and the referee is going to bring play back for that challenge,
[2397.44 - 2398.88] P:2116.79 E:0.098211 |  but he's not going to take any action,
[2398.88 - 2400.64] P:2066.26 E:0.097214 |  but it will be a free kick to Galatasaray.
[2400.64 - 2404.36] P:2141.11 E:0.108785 |  It's a classic late challenge from Hannibal on Angelina.
[2404.36 - 2406.84] P:2277.90 E:0.100061 |  Zaha again getting the better of Dallow.
[2406.84 - 2409.88] P:1999.91 E:0.095844 |  I was just saying a moment earlier that Zaha has been quiet,
[2409.88 - 2413.24] P:1878.46 E:0.073459 |  but when he has been needed,
[2413.36 - 2415.56] P:1888.52 E:0.096084 |  he's certainly got the better of Diogo Dallow,
[2415.56 - 2418.28] P:1992.65 E:0.082547 |  and they're starting to really feel that relationship
[2418.28 - 2419.52] P:1812.52 E:0.102076 |  between Angelina and Zaha.
[2419.52 - 2422.12] P:1892.24 E:0.069889 |  It's causing Manchester United a problem now.
[2422.12 - 2425.20] P:1897.67 E:0.072079 |  Vodaccha finds Sanchez.
[2425.20 - 2428.36] P:1909.67 E:0.095118 |  Ball is unable to be controlled by Tete,
[2428.36 - 2431.76] P:1909.22 E:0.097643 |  and it runs all the way through to Onana, all in yellow,
[2431.76 - 2434.92] P:1880.81 E:0.097513 |  away towards our left-hand side in front of the Stratford end.
[2434.92 - 2439.68] P:1851.49 E:0.092985 |  On a damp but very mild evening, light rain continuing to fall.
[2439.68 - 2441.96] P:1942.01 E:0.078565 |  Onana chips it away downfield.
[2442.00 - 2444.92] P:1914.83 E:0.094900 |  Hoiland tries to get his head on the end of that inside the centre-circle.
[2444.92 - 2447.92] P:1945.01 E:0.086194 |  Goes away from him. Zaha lifts it forward.
[2447.92 - 2449.08] P:1871.19 E:0.099938 |  Terera under pressure.
[2449.08 - 2453.96] P:2007.92 E:0.093849 |  Kymiros Kasemiro slides into the challenge again, looking for Rashford.
[2453.96 - 2455.60] P:1938.84 E:0.101964 |  That must be what? Three or four times,
[2455.60 - 2457.00] P:1812.75 E:0.088445 |  they've looked for that ball over the top.
[2457.00 - 2458.12] P:2000.41 E:0.059147 |  Hand the rest.
[2458.12 - 2465.16] P:1927.24 E:0.077491 |  Just Rashford and Bruno Fernandez playing on the shoulders of Galatasaray's back four,
[2465.16 - 2467.76] P:1964.71 E:0.085096 |  picking and choosing their target and playing off them.
[2468.76 - 2471.44] P:2005.70 E:0.061156 |  The rain heavy now.
[2471.44 - 2473.12] P:1938.93 E:0.093068 |  Ikadi picks it up.
[2473.12 - 2478.12] P:1990.92 E:0.085817 |  Cross comes in from Ahan, and turned behind for a corner kick.
[2478.12 - 2480.68] P:1964.65 E:0.091031 |  Let's see what Galatasaray can do from a set piece here.
[2480.68 - 2482.16] P:1869.38 E:0.100311 |  Five-living radio Manchester.
[2482.16 - 2484.60] P:1935.91 E:0.097903 |  No idea how Ikadi has got that amount of space
[2484.60 - 2488.08] P:1976.96 E:0.098878 |  coming from the central striker position for Galatasaray,
[2488.08 - 2491.56] P:1853.96 E:0.096967 |  dropping into the midfield, turning and feeding a runner
[2491.56 - 2493.12] P:1878.59 E:0.092033 |  and getting a corner as a result,
[2493.12 - 2494.88] P:1819.44 E:0.087138 |  but it's too easy for Manchester United.
[2494.88 - 2496.16] P:1903.95 E:0.088888 |  This is it, it's Verran.
[2496.44 - 2499.00] P:1888.24 E:0.079954 |  Just really obvious, go with him.
[2500.72 - 2504.40] P:1938.23 E:0.103197 |  So in the teaming rain, 1-1, Manchester United have got some defending to do.
[2504.40 - 2507.20] P:1883.91 E:0.096872 |  Galatasaray on that far side, the right corner kick,
[2507.20 - 2509.24] P:1835.98 E:0.086098 |  didn't beat the first man, that was disappointing.
[2509.24 - 2511.52] P:1785.03 E:0.087363 |  Headed away by Bruno Fernandez.
[2511.52 - 2514.48] P:1824.69 E:0.083923 |  Back with Tete goes, Galatasaray back in possession.
[2514.48 - 2516.80] P:1852.59 E:0.089206 |  Bueda right back, forward of the centre circle,
[2516.80 - 2519.80] P:1722.28 E:0.093037 |  low ball in from Angelina, a little flick by Terera didn't quite come off.
[2519.80 - 2523.12] P:1800.30 E:0.098952 |  It will reach Tete, right side of the penalty area, pulls it back now.
[2523.12 - 2525.92] P:1842.35 E:0.089853 |  Aktochok, glue with the first shot, that was blocked by Verran.
[2525.96 - 2528.88] P:1906.83 E:0.107225 |  Comes out towards Rashford, he gives it back towards Zaha.
[2528.88 - 2531.36] P:1884.47 E:0.100879 |  A little bit careless, Zaha now hoisted across,
[2531.36 - 2533.76] P:1898.22 E:0.092306 |  Tete waits for it to drop, brings it under control,
[2533.76 - 2535.96] P:1739.16 E:0.104569 |  right corner of the area onto his right foot, the Brazilian,
[2535.96 - 2539.44] P:1933.12 E:0.094876 |  looking for a shooting opportunity, blocked, hit first time by Ihan.
[2539.44 - 2542.84] P:1895.93 E:0.092332 |  And he's skied that from, I don't know, just under 30 yards out.
[2542.84 - 2545.24] P:1841.51 E:0.090298 |  It was a good old up and under, goal kick, 1-1.
[2545.24 - 2549.56] P:1888.09 E:0.078711 |  Yeah, really good passage of play from Galatasaray,
[2549.56 - 2552.16] P:1853.78 E:0.082730 |  sustaining the attack from the set piece.
[2552.16 - 2555.08] P:1872.27 E:0.095023 |  Zaha, Tete, again, Tete's been quiet as well, hasn't he?
[2556.92 - 2559.80] P:1874.32 E:0.105653 |  Just wonder about Manchester United, they started well,
[2559.80 - 2561.72] P:1898.32 E:0.078724 |  they were rewarded with a goal,
[2561.72 - 2564.24] P:1877.64 E:0.098108 |  yet since the Galatasaray equalised it,
[2564.24 - 2568.36] P:1907.21 E:0.090865 |  it's almost as if their confidence has taken a little bit of a dent.
[2569.36 - 2572.48] P:1792.70 E:0.095118 |  Because aside from the ball over the top on the counterattack,
[2572.48 - 2576.76] P:1850.20 E:0.095357 |  they're not creating anything, as here is Mason Mount, to Hannibal.
[2576.76 - 2580.88] P:1990.35 E:0.103742 |  Dallow going on ahead of him, but that's it, dives in, did he catch Dallow?
[2580.88 - 2585.32] P:1897.28 E:0.109474 |  The referee has a look at it and says no, and cleared away by Zaha.
[2586.92 - 2591.28] P:1894.93 E:0.100566 |  And the animated Galatasaray coach, Okanburek,
[2591.28 - 2594.80] P:1927.66 E:0.091714 |  with a wag of his index finger on his right foot in his suit,
[2594.80 - 2599.64] P:1835.14 E:0.089567 |  he also thought that it was a challenge made, fairly by Badaccia.
[2599.64 - 2601.64] P:1866.92 E:0.089132 |  He got a little bit lucky, Badaccia,
[2601.64 - 2604.64] P:1815.80 E:0.087904 |  because he's gone for the sliding tackle on Dallow,
[2604.64 - 2608.40] P:1892.88 E:0.090769 |  just watching a replay now, he's tried to dink it over the top of Badaccia,
[2608.40 - 2611.64] P:1930.24 E:0.084739 |  who's slid and committed himself, and it's deflected back off Dallow,
[2611.64 - 2614.04] P:1910.69 E:0.081159 |  and Dallow's ended up falling on the floor,
[2614.16 - 2617.48] P:1903.62 E:0.075180 |  hoping that the referee would have given a free kick, but not for me.
[2618.08 - 2621.24] P:1773.10 E:0.106942 |  They've only scored seven goals in their seven Premier League games,
[2621.24 - 2623.92] P:1834.60 E:0.103390 |  which is their fewest since the 0-708 campaign,
[2623.92 - 2627.96] P:1914.33 E:0.087769 |  the difference being in that season, they'd actually picked up 14 points,
[2627.96 - 2630.48] P:1875.26 E:0.080416 |  because they were hardly conceding many goals.
[2630.48 - 2634.80] P:1923.47 E:0.098132 |  But they've conceded again tonight, and they're struggling really to test Muslera.
[2634.80 - 2637.52] P:1952.45 E:0.108849 |  Out towards Rashford, coming in now with that left touch line.
[2637.52 - 2641.60] P:2038.75 E:0.104897 |  Rashford with pace, enters the penalty area, six yards up, now with a byline.
[2641.64 - 2643.76] P:1972.63 E:0.112368 |  He falls to Mason Mount, blocked by Hannibal,
[2643.76 - 2647.32] P:1937.87 E:0.101634 |  I think he got in the way of his own player's effort there by Mason Mount,
[2647.32 - 2650.32] P:1956.64 E:0.100629 |  and it goes out of play for a Manchester United throw.
[2650.32 - 2653.80] P:1994.34 E:0.096397 |  He did again, Manchester United to the byline, cut back from Rashford,
[2653.80 - 2658.84] P:1959.66 E:0.089062 |  and it was Davison Sánchez's leg that deflected the ball into the path of Mason Mount,
[2658.84 - 2660.04] P:1872.16 E:0.092399 |  and he knows it.
[2660.04 - 2663.72] P:1877.06 E:0.099353 |  Fernandez fires in a shot from the left corner of the area and hits the side netting.
[2665.00 - 2668.48] P:1841.31 E:0.095905 |  And it will be a goal kick, and there's a player down,
[2668.48 - 2672.84] P:1870.21 E:0.089309 |  and the Galatasaray penalty area, and the referee's just checking on him,
[2672.84 - 2675.84] P:1858.46 E:0.075278 |  so there might just be a stoppage in play.
[2675.84 - 2679.04] P:1833.47 E:0.079752 |  It's got to be Badakshi, hasn't it?
[2680.88 - 2682.40] P:1827.55 E:0.092079 |  No, it's not Badakshi.
[2685.40 - 2687.52] P:1914.73 E:0.096920 |  We'll see who it is in a moment.
[2687.52 - 2692.56] P:1894.57 E:0.090113 |  Our view has been, first of all, blocked by the referee, and now from Muslera.
[2693.48 - 2697.20] P:1852.43 E:0.095015 |  So it's Terera, who's down, the former Arsenal player.
[2698.16 - 2705.12] P:1908.23 E:0.091639 |  Four seasons at Arsenal, but he had the last two away with Lowens at Atlético Madrid and Fiorentina,
[2705.12 - 2709.60] P:1968.57 E:0.091882 |  so he actually only made 89 appearances with four goals during his time,
[2709.60 - 2712.72] P:1945.90 E:0.086643 |  but he joined Galatasaray in 2022,
[2712.72 - 2717.52] P:1867.16 E:0.080223 |  and he's getting some treatment, as were inside the last 30 seconds of normal time here,
[2717.52 - 2722.20] P:1910.89 E:0.086748 |  and Erick Tinhag is taking this opportunity to get some instructions across to Dalla.
[2723.20 - 2727.36] P:1958.51 E:0.088491 |  They've had chances Manchester United, that one from Mount earlier.
[2727.36 - 2730.20] P:1785.07 E:0.093544 |  I think that was the opening few minutes, it was Bruno Fernanda,
[2730.20 - 2733.60] P:1733.32 E:0.088138 |  so they have created Manchester United, but just lacked...
[2734.44 - 2737.00] P:1928.77 E:0.087562 |  ...rooflessness in front of goal.
[2737.52 - 2739.72] P:1890.99 E:0.106579 |  Southampton have got their first win in five at the weekend,
[2739.72 - 2741.68] P:2031.03 E:0.101390 |  leading at Stoke City in the championship.
[2741.68 - 2746.16] P:1960.15 E:0.096693 |  Stoke City, Nils Southampton-1 is a latest score, still playing in the first half.
[2746.16 - 2750.36] P:1943.21 E:0.081896 |  Terera is back on his feet, he jogs to the side of the pitch here.
[2750.36 - 2754.96] P:1901.86 E:0.097375 |  Three minutes have added on time, which we're now into here on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[2754.96 - 2759.20] P:1890.53 E:0.089830 |  Manchester United won Galatasaray won, the goal kick is headed away by Lindelof,
[2759.20 - 2762.48] P:1929.31 E:0.074276 |  for Manchester United, Hoiland, it runs off the top of his head,
[2762.48 - 2767.28] P:1820.62 E:0.087864 |  and Güey, the right back, only 23 years of age, they picked him up from Rang
[2767.28 - 2771.68] P:1848.58 E:0.084369 |  when he was released the right back two years ago.
[2771.68 - 2774.44] P:1819.36 E:0.088473 |  Bit of interest shown from Arsenal and Brighton.
[2775.16 - 2780.32] P:1860.71 E:0.106940 |  He's a promising player, Sasha Güey, headed from Zaha.
[2780.56 - 2783.92] P:1942.47 E:0.094745 |  Achtokoglu with the follow-up, lifts it goalwards,
[2783.92 - 2787.20] P:1862.08 E:0.081842 |  and he's lifted it behind in a goal kick as he was closed down,
[2787.20 - 2788.68] P:1784.54 E:0.082041 |  diving the feet by Onana.
[2788.68 - 2791.08] P:1907.52 E:0.082570 |  I think the referee's actually brought it back,
[2791.08 - 2796.92] P:1852.44 E:0.071969 |  because the deflection took the ball into Achtokoglu's path,
[2796.92 - 2798.28] P:1954.62 E:0.067541 |  off his hand.
[2798.92 - 2802.16] P:1869.59 E:0.087639 |  The referee's brought it back for a free kick to Manchester United.
[2802.16 - 2803.16] P:1731.27 E:0.123218 |  So one one it remains.
[2803.16 - 2806.92] P:1984.32 E:0.104052 |  That's Izzy Christensen, who's with us here tonight on this Tuesday evening
[2806.92 - 2810.32] P:1862.47 E:0.096466 |  in the Champions League, and keeping abreast of what's happening in the football league,
[2810.80 - 2814.52] P:1928.62 E:0.095056 |  tomorrow Newcastle against Paris Saint-Germain from Sevente, it's Rashford.
[2814.52 - 2816.52] P:1903.98 E:0.113055 |  Tries to get away from Güey.
[2817.52 - 2822.12] P:1947.16 E:0.104096 |  The referee is going to bring play back and give a free kick to Manchester United,
[2822.12 - 2825.04] P:1862.73 E:0.097605 |  again the Slovakian referee, trying to let the game flow.
[2826.32 - 2829.52] P:1875.79 E:0.102102 |  Thought Amravak was poised to take a quick free kick, but they are going to wait.
[2829.96 - 2833.64] P:2009.62 E:0.098398 |  So in stoppage time, six yards in from the left touch line, one one.
[2833.64 - 2837.60] P:2063.43 E:0.101252 |  Manchester United have an opportunity to toss this ball into the penalty area.
[2837.60 - 2839.96] P:2046.63 E:0.096487 |  It looks like Bruno Fernandez is going to whip this in.
[2840.68 - 2845.16] P:2069.96 E:0.103284 |  A minute before halftime, you've got to put it into the mix with real quality.
[2846.84 - 2850.40] P:2121.07 E:0.111689 |  Verrani's up from the back, Lindelof was also there.
[2850.40 - 2853.68] P:2107.07 E:0.101663 |  Casamiro's a natural threat, in it comes now, it was dropping.
[2853.68 - 2857.60] P:1934.01 E:0.102035 |  And Terera is skyed that up in the air, it drops outside the area.
[2857.60 - 2861.52] P:1908.71 E:0.098809 |  It's met by a right footed volley by Terera, who's lifted again quite high
[2861.52 - 2864.28] P:1917.01 E:0.094962 |  and it drops out of play for a throw over on that far side.
[2864.28 - 2867.00] P:2036.06 E:0.099461 |  In Manchester United's group, it's halftime in Denmark,
[2867.04 - 2869.80] P:1995.52 E:0.094634 |  Copenhagen-Nil, Bam Munich-Nil, PSV-Nil,
[2869.80 - 2872.32] P:2134.43 E:0.100171 |  Sevilla-Nil is a halftime scorer in Arsenal's group.
[2872.32 - 2874.72] P:2029.01 E:0.104840 |  Arsenal, remember, are still drawing one one away in line.
[2874.72 - 2877.16] P:2011.56 E:0.115150 |  So we'll get used from halftime from Alastair Bruce Ball.
[2877.16 - 2880.52] P:1973.21 E:0.099864 |  Fernandez with a cross from Manchester United, Sanchez there with a clearance.
[2880.52 - 2884.64] P:1933.92 E:0.097087 |  Ahan hooks it away for Galatasaray, back with Amravak though for Manchester United.
[2884.64 - 2888.12] P:2062.89 E:0.103274 |  Midway through the Galatasaray half, the whistles and the cheers
[2888.12 - 2891.04] P:2036.49 E:0.102630 |  and from the Galatasaray travelling support, Mason Mount's going to struggle
[2891.04 - 2893.12] P:1996.43 E:0.098668 |  to keep that ball in play on that far side.
[2893.12 - 2896.52] P:1973.65 E:0.112822 |  Buoy gets there first, his clearance though is only a partial one.
[2897.40 - 2900.08] P:1870.45 E:0.108644 |  And then the referee is saying he was fouled by Mason Mount
[2900.08 - 2902.76] P:1878.58 E:0.086920 |  and Mount actually walked into the referee
[2902.76 - 2905.12] P:1931.42 E:0.087710 |  as it'll be a free kick to the Turkish champions.
[2905.12 - 2906.44] P:1779.08 E:0.068293 |  No, it's just in...
[2906.44 - 2908.88] P:1901.75 E:0.094612 |  Tell you what, that's what Manchester United have missed,
[2908.88 - 2913.28] P:1866.41 E:0.091639 |  that endeavour and that hunger to win the ball back from Mason Mount.
[2913.28 - 2916.44] P:1916.96 E:0.095314 |  And that is something Mason Mount will always give you, is a high work rate
[2916.44 - 2918.04] P:1795.05 E:0.078141 |  and that is why he's in the team.
[2919.40 - 2924.08] P:1824.40 E:0.092140 |  Gareth Southgate is here, he's alongside Steve Holland.
[2924.12 - 2927.64] P:1894.39 E:0.097533 |  He was here at the weekend, was Gareth Southgate's number two.
[2928.92 - 2933.56] P:1901.23 E:0.080422 |  Mason Mount getting a run in the side now after injury.
[2934.72 - 2939.92] P:1911.07 E:0.102822 |  As the half-time whistle is sounded and it's Manchester United won Galatasaray
[2939.92 - 2941.84] P:1922.52 E:0.098057 |  won which is the half-time score.
[2941.84 - 2946.92] P:2013.06 E:0.089744 |  Poiland gave them the lead with a header after 17 minutes from Rashford's cross.
[2946.92 - 2951.52] P:1852.22 E:0.085544 |  But within six minutes, poor defending by Dallow and Wilfred Zahar had equalised, is he?
[2952.40 - 2954.96] P:1936.27 E:0.089086 |  Yeah, a good start from Manchester United but...
[2955.80 - 2959.32] P:1934.30 E:0.090062 |  He gave Galatasaray the option to get back into the game,
[2959.32 - 2961.32] P:1814.77 E:0.093831 |  poor defending by Dallow, like you said.
[2962.00 - 2965.16] P:1943.30 E:0.083206 |  And obviously, we're poised for a pretty exciting second half here.
[2965.16 - 2969.28] P:1861.24 E:0.094101 |  So half-time at Old Trafford in Group A, Manchester United won, Galatasaray won.
[2971.72 - 2975.36] P:1711.51 E:0.102026 |  Ian Dennis and Izzy Christensen watching events at Old Trafford there
[2975.36 - 2979.16] P:1813.46 E:0.093887 |  and there's been a bit of criticism for Anana on social media.
[2979.16 - 2981.56] P:1845.26 E:0.081888 |  Kit says, can we re-sign Dehaia yet?
[2981.56 - 2987.16] P:1685.59 E:0.088956 |  Izzy, is that fair? Is that the reason Manchester United are level going into the second half?
[2987.16 - 2990.92] P:1777.15 E:0.104290 |  I did look at the replay and I did wonder why Anana didn't come out for the ball.
[2990.92 - 2995.56] P:1862.52 E:0.081838 |  When a ball is bouncing like that inside your six-yard box towards the goal,
[2996.76 - 3000.36] P:1926.16 E:0.099621 |  it's a tough one but I think a goalkeeper needs to command the situation
[3000.36 - 3003.68] P:1856.55 E:0.090818 |  either by communication or by just coming and claiming the ball.
[3003.68 - 3008.04] P:1837.53 E:0.082409 |  And it's given Zahar the option to kind of body Dallow
[3008.04 - 3011.32] P:1764.95 E:0.094447 |  and keep the momentum of the ball bouncing further and further towards goal.
[3011.32 - 3014.48] P:1914.36 E:0.094772 |  And it's a lucky finish but Anana is actually caught in no-man's land
[3014.48 - 3017.16] P:1818.26 E:0.090742 |  and the bounce has just taken it over him into the back of the net.
[3017.16 - 3021.88] P:1829.41 E:0.089365 |  But I think it's six and two-threes between Dallow and Anana in that situation.
[3022.48 - 3024.76] P:1638.03 E:0.114239 |  Pat Nevin has also been watching the game with us.
[3024.76 - 3028.88] P:1611.32 E:0.094675 |  Pat, from Manchester United, we know from their performances in the Premier League
[3028.88 - 3033.28] P:1617.22 E:0.087514 |  that they've got one of the worst conversion records in the Premier League.
[3033.28 - 3034.88] P:1551.11 E:0.095911 |  They don't turn their chances into goals
[3034.88 - 3037.20] P:1720.52 E:0.091042 |  and there have been a few occasions in the first half
[3037.20 - 3039.04] P:1637.68 E:0.083696 |  where they've been guilty of exactly that.
[3039.04 - 3041.48] P:1719.82 E:0.109211 |  They have been maybe made some mountain a couple of times.
[3041.48 - 3045.00] P:1620.47 E:0.089814 |  He's got himself in the right positions, he's got it on target.
[3045.00 - 3048.88] P:1620.60 E:0.100182 |  Once his own player was in the way, it was a bit of a shame for him.
[3048.88 - 3050.88] P:1389.44 E:0.095871 |  But players will always tell you the same thing.
[3050.88 - 3053.84] P:1518.60 E:0.101567 |  You keep on getting into those positions and keep on putting it on target
[3053.84 - 3056.08] P:1828.36 E:0.083725 |  and eventually they'll start going in.
[3056.08 - 3057.80] P:1559.81 E:0.100610 |  It's just luck of the draw sometimes.
[3057.80 - 3060.60] P:1538.41 E:0.097222 |  I mean, you're talking about the Galatasaray goal there.
[3060.60 - 3062.24] P:1591.22 E:0.089249 |  You know, that's a deflection.
[3062.24 - 3066.20] P:1701.31 E:0.099284 |  You know, had that been caught clean, Anana probably saves it quite easily.
[3066.20 - 3068.88] P:1517.34 E:0.105484 |  But it was a mis-hit, it was a deflection, it goes over his head.
[3068.88 - 3071.48] P:1773.03 E:0.093504 |  And, you know, when it's not going for you, it's not going for you.
[3071.48 - 3075.20] P:1729.30 E:0.092257 |  But Manchester United have looked dangerous in quite a few occasions.
[3075.20 - 3079.32] P:1691.77 E:0.097508 |  They look the stronger team, the better team, but not by a huge amount.
[3079.32 - 3081.00] P:1437.46 E:0.106474 |  And you know, that is always there.
[3081.00 - 3086.44] P:1740.25 E:0.089206 |  There's enough danger in that offensive triumvirate.
[3086.44 - 3090.24] P:1774.62 E:0.089133 |  You know, the three that have got particularly 30, if he starts to get going.
[3090.24 - 3093.44] P:1475.34 E:0.093659 |  But Zaha, I thought he started really quietly, but he got the goal
[3093.44 - 3095.36] P:1633.89 E:0.088042 |  and suddenly he's looking lively again.
[3095.36 - 3096.88] P:1382.72 E:0.112689 |  And Akhadi hardly been involved.
[3096.88 - 3099.88] P:1780.68 E:0.072214 |  But you know, give him half a chance in your score.
[3099.88 - 3103.60] P:1674.25 E:0.095090 |  Well, Zaha very much enjoyed scoring that goal against Manchester United.
[3103.60 - 3107.96] P:1619.57 E:0.086448 |  His former side, of course, but it means that Manchester United are level at the break,
[3107.96 - 3111.48] P:1661.41 E:0.077948 |  despite having had just about the better of the first half.
[3111.48 - 3112.84] P:1709.36 E:0.091735 |  We'll be back there very shortly.
[3112.84 - 3116.12] P:1704.11 E:0.097387 |  It's also half-time in the game between Lons and Arsenal.
[3116.12 - 3119.76] P:1891.18 E:0.071871 |  And Alistair Bruce Bull, it's also level.
[3119.76 - 3122.48] P:1920.61 E:0.109030 |  Yeah, same scoreline, Lons won Arsenal one.
[3122.52 - 3125.92] P:1730.61 E:0.104865 |  It was going very nicely for Arsenal for the first 25 minutes or so,
[3125.92 - 3130.60] P:1786.32 E:0.107404 |  up against a highly motivated Lons team, playing in a supercharged atmosphere as well.
[3130.60 - 3135.00] P:1859.44 E:0.100188 |  But Arsenal soaked it up the early pressure in those opening 10 minutes,
[3135.00 - 3136.64] P:1985.01 E:0.104111 |  then stole themselves a goal.
[3136.64 - 3137.72] P:2061.77 E:0.097521 |  It was a Lons mistake.
[3137.72 - 3140.84] P:1863.18 E:0.096869 |  Adrian Thomason gave the ball away to Bakai Osaka,
[3140.84 - 3146.04] P:1907.85 E:0.099472 |  who played the perfect pass into Gabrielle Jézus, who took it on and finished brilliantly.
[3146.04 - 3148.92] P:1856.24 E:0.098813 |  They only held that lead for 10 minutes or so, though.
[3148.92 - 3150.96] P:1711.72 E:0.106868 |  And this time it was Arsenal giving the ball away.
[3150.96 - 3154.44] P:1860.64 E:0.103735 |  David Reyes' mistake and Wahi, the young centre forward,
[3154.44 - 3157.96] P:1885.31 E:0.100080 |  did really well to control the ball forward to him and just flick it across
[3157.96 - 3162.12] P:1728.02 E:0.101651 |  as he was off balance to Thomason, who made up for his earlier mistake
[3162.12 - 3167.00] P:1782.13 E:0.096958 |  by beautifully stroking the bouncing ball into the far corner of his net with the right foot.
[3167.00 - 3170.28] P:1775.48 E:0.106601 |  Then the real worry, Kelly, just after the half-hour mark,
[3170.28 - 3176.72] P:1717.44 E:0.096214 |  Bakai Osaka going down, struggling, went off the pitch under his own steam,
[3176.72 - 3178.88] P:1800.64 E:0.097564 |  replaced by Fabio Vieira.
[3178.88 - 3180.72] P:1841.37 E:0.106294 |  It may just be precautionary that.
[3180.72 - 3183.36] P:1700.58 E:0.103400 |  Obviously, big game against Manchester City coming on Sunday,
[3183.36 - 3186.36] P:1744.80 E:0.104208 |  but he has had a few niggles and knocks this season,
[3186.36 - 3188.48] P:1827.58 E:0.096274 |  so I know that will concern Arsenal fans.
[3188.48 - 3190.00] P:1803.56 E:0.100744 |  Late chance in the first half.
[3190.00 - 3191.64] P:1770.31 E:0.097119 |  There might say half chance as well, actually.
[3191.64 - 3194.08] P:1892.54 E:0.104990 |  Gabrielle Jézus looking at the far post,
[3194.08 - 3197.64] P:1822.02 E:0.090771 |  hit a half volley from about 15 yards out, couldn't keep it down,
[3197.64 - 3199.48] P:1566.90 E:0.106874 |  and he went flashing over the crossbar.
[3199.48 - 3203.44] P:1822.64 E:0.100513 |  So obviously the sack of injury is a concern, but at halftime it's level.
[3203.44 - 3205.32] P:1538.08 E:0.080177 |  Lost one Arsenal, won.
[3205.32 - 3207.00] P:1494.19 E:0.111380 |  Ali Fanoth, thank you very much.
[3207.00 - 3209.28] P:1502.65 E:0.073992 |  Tell us to Bruce Paul, keeping us across that game,
[3209.28 - 3212.48] P:1592.71 E:0.091581 |  but there's all sorts going on elsewhere in the Champions League this evening.
[3212.48 - 3216.68] P:1712.97 E:0.094319 |  John Bennett is across it, and is being treated by Jude Bellingham.
[3216.68 - 3218.96] P:1527.41 E:0.113180 |  I knew we'd be talking about Jude Bellingham again.
[3218.96 - 3220.12] P:1731.82 E:0.104301 |  Yeah, this is in Group C.
[3220.12 - 3223.04] P:1492.46 E:0.105522 |  Napoli won, Real Madrid 2 at halftime.
[3223.04 - 3225.28] P:1844.74 E:0.087342 |  What more can you say about Jude Bellingham?
[3225.28 - 3226.96] P:1520.84 E:0.100978 |  Eight goals in nine games now.
[3226.96 - 3229.28] P:2050.88 E:0.086200 |  This was special as well to make it 2-1.
[3229.28 - 3232.20] P:1760.68 E:0.087863 |  He picked it up just outside the centre-circle.
[3232.20 - 3235.48] P:1564.81 E:0.094333 |  He was driving at the penalty area, passed a couple of defenders,
[3235.48 - 3238.92] P:1700.01 E:0.084289 |  then side-footed into the net from just inside the box.
[3238.96 - 3241.48] P:1699.10 E:0.088739 |  Awful defending, but you have to credit Bellingham.
[3241.48 - 3245.48] P:1510.61 E:0.091668 |  And earlier he'd set up Vinicius Jr. for the equaliser after Leo Ostegard
[3245.48 - 3248.20] P:1713.80 E:0.092078 |  had headed Napoli into an early lead.
[3248.20 - 3251.16] P:1640.20 E:0.090525 |  Ostermen nearly made it 2-2, great save by Kepper,
[3251.16 - 3253.16] P:1751.45 E:0.089088 |  but it's Napoli won, Real Madrid 2.
[3253.16 - 3256.00] P:1755.87 E:0.102285 |  All the other three matches I'm watching are 0-0.
[3256.00 - 3258.72] P:1573.28 E:0.088450 |  In Group A Manchester United's Group, FC Copenhagen 0,
[3258.72 - 3262.08] P:1927.23 E:0.084198 |  Bayern Munich 0, Bayern struggling to create chances.
[3262.08 - 3266.12] P:1761.76 E:0.094401 |  In Group B Arsenal's Group, PSV Eindhoven 0, Sevilla 0,
[3266.12 - 3268.60] P:1901.89 E:0.077989 |  Sevilla yet to have a shot on target.
[3268.64 - 3270.56] P:1589.16 E:0.101272 |  And in Group D, this is actually a decent game.
[3270.56 - 3273.64] P:1644.42 E:0.089930 |  Inter, Niel, Ben Fika, Niel, Inter on top here.
[3273.64 - 3276.88] P:1713.04 E:0.075372 |  Denzel Dunn-Fries has missed one of the best chances for Inter.
[3277.60 - 3279.44] P:2006.97 E:0.083176 |  Thank you very much, John Bennett.
[3279.44 - 3281.92] P:1836.38 E:0.064829 |  Of course, those games taking place in the Champions League
[3281.92 - 3283.92] P:1964.38 E:0.061278 |  at the moment were eight o'clock kick-offs.
[3283.92 - 3287.20] P:2046.14 E:0.083506 |  7.30 kick-off in the only Premier League match of the evening.
[3287.20 - 3291.20] P:1811.18 E:0.089761 |  It's between Luton and Burnley, about an hour gone, Chris Coles.
[3291.20 - 3293.00] P:2006.62 E:0.095436 |  Yes, 65 minutes gone, Kelly.
[3293.00 - 3294.36] P:1710.89 E:0.098961 |  Luton, Niel, Burnley won.
[3294.36 - 3296.40] P:2231.20 E:0.085522 |  Lyall Foster's first half stoppage time goal.
[3296.40 - 3297.48] P:2020.77 E:0.087775 |  Still the difference.
[3297.48 - 3300.08] P:2028.87 E:0.092479 |  Burnley looking more likely to extend that lead
[3300.08 - 3302.00] P:1790.63 E:0.091126 |  rather than Luton finding an equaliser.
[3302.00 - 3302.88] P:1620.57 E:0.095417 |  Boyd by that goal.
[3302.88 - 3304.12] P:1971.96 E:0.070176 |  Burnley looking good.
[3304.12 - 3305.80] P:1829.69 E:0.090257 |  The front three of Luca Colliozcio,
[3305.80 - 3307.56] P:1996.14 E:0.077667 |  Lyall Foster, Zechiam Duni.
[3307.56 - 3311.00] P:1946.74 E:0.083305 |  They look really threatening whenever they get into Luton's defensive third.
[3311.00 - 3312.88] P:2094.50 E:0.094091 |  Although Luton have just come really close
[3312.88 - 3315.48] P:1913.31 E:0.076428 |  via a Jacob Brown back post header.
[3315.48 - 3318.20] P:1961.79 E:0.098175 |  Remarkable goal line clearance from Josh Cullen,
[3318.20 - 3320.28] P:1962.09 E:0.093333 |  who threw himself onto his own goal line,
[3320.28 - 3322.16] P:1924.93 E:0.092315 |  somehow managed to head clear.
[3322.16 - 3325.00] P:1909.57 E:0.099276 |  Really good chance for Luton, who are still giving this a go
[3325.00 - 3327.32] P:1912.95 E:0.076966 |  and they still have plenty of time to get back into things
[3327.36 - 3329.16] P:1886.68 E:0.080286 |  with 25 minutes to play.
[3329.16 - 3330.92] P:1831.98 E:0.067824 |  Luton, Niel, Burnley won.
[3330.92 - 3332.08] P:2033.19 E:0.101266 |  Thank you very much, Chris.
[3332.08 - 3334.96] P:1734.67 E:0.092815 |  Let's head to Portman Road and the championship with Aaron Paul.
[3334.96 - 3336.12] P:1854.45 E:0.094426 |  Ipswich two-hold, Niel.
[3336.12 - 3338.12] P:1743.51 E:0.093454 |  Goals from Wes Burns and Conor Chaplin
[3338.12 - 3340.68] P:1918.61 E:0.101242 |  have given the home side a really solid foundation this evening.
[3340.68 - 3344.28] P:1896.95 E:0.095816 |  Hull have struggled with the quality Ipswich possess in the final third
[3344.28 - 3345.96] P:1906.02 E:0.092559 |  and they nearly grabbed a third.
[3345.96 - 3348.72] P:1914.46 E:0.099082 |  Marcus Harness in the D option to shoot.
[3348.72 - 3349.84] P:1788.40 E:0.104780 |  No, unselfish.
[3349.84 - 3351.48] P:1927.30 E:0.099788 |  He passed it forward to George Hust.
[3351.48 - 3354.64] P:1869.23 E:0.102022 |  He's shot two tame to find the back of their easy safe.

[3584.76 - 3585.48] P:1891.61 E:0.049261 |  Yeah.

[3613.96 - 3614.96] P:1593.69 E:0.040088 |  I don't know.
[3615.96 - 3616.96] P:1655.51 E:0.058704 |  I don't know.

[3626.80 - 3627.96] P:1819.08 E:0.090762 |  Yeah, they've restarted.
[3627.96 - 3629.52] P:1747.33 E:0.047053 |  Yeah. Can't do anything.
[3629.52 - 3630.52] P:1306.34 E:0.033626 |  No.
[3630.52 - 3632.12] P:1668.98 E:0.052523 |  I can't do anything.
[3632.12 - 3633.12] P:1216.12 E:0.076695 |  I can't do anything.
[3637.12 - 3641.16] P:1860.70 E:0.083156 |  The voices you heard there of the video assistant referee,
[3641.16 - 3644.60] P:1928.28 E:0.082668 |  his assistant, the assistant video referee,
[3644.60 - 3647.76] P:1913.64 E:0.086275 |  also the replay operator, who was the person saying
[3647.76 - 3651.00] P:1605.22 E:0.084051 |  that the on-field decision was offside as well.
[3651.00 - 3654.00] P:1877.13 E:0.091805 |  We also heard the noise, the voice rather,
[3654.00 - 3656.80] P:1853.48 E:0.083636 |  of Oli Kohut, who was the PGMOL hub ops.
[3656.80 - 3659.92] P:1976.32 E:0.072694 |  So those two people knocked qualified referees
[3659.92 - 3661.72] P:1761.24 E:0.093220 |  in that instance, but did spot the error.
[3661.72 - 3665.28] P:1881.31 E:0.080918 |  PGMOL says it was a result of a lapse of concentration
[3665.28 - 3667.36] P:2165.09 E:0.063666 |  and loss of focus.
[3667.36 - 3670.20] P:1802.25 E:0.089761 |  Scotland Play Island in a crunch rugby World Cup pool
[3670.20 - 3673.64] P:1936.11 E:0.092385 |  B match on Saturday in the latest Rugby Union Daily podcast
[3673.68 - 3677.16] P:1995.38 E:0.089834 |  correspondent Chris Jones, BBC Scotland journalist Tom English
[3677.16 - 3679.76] P:1869.26 E:0.073467 |  and BBC Wales commentator Gareth Rhys Owen
[3679.76 - 3683.04] P:1776.80 E:0.058330 |  discussed the size of the task facing the Scots.
[3683.04 - 3686.00] P:1878.31 E:0.079652 |  From here on in, especially considering you, Tom,
[3686.00 - 3687.44] P:1943.97 E:0.082527 |  it's just knock-out rugby.
[3687.44 - 3688.28] P:1633.66 E:0.085049 |  And here we go.
[3688.28 - 3689.40] P:2143.19 E:0.089559 |  Yeah, it is, yeah.
[3689.40 - 3694.96] P:2126.50 E:0.087120 |  It's as the Scottish players are saying after the Romania game,
[3694.96 - 3700.72] P:1957.34 E:0.063060 |  do or die, their World Cup final and variations on that theme.
[3700.72 - 3703.08] P:2049.98 E:0.078697 |  So it's, yeah, it's serious.
[3703.12 - 3706.40] P:2030.16 E:0.059075 |  It's serious. We were in the camp this morning
[3706.40 - 3708.80] P:2013.63 E:0.081003 |  and it was Finn Russell and it was Ali Price.
[3708.80 - 3712.48] P:1846.69 E:0.080433 |  And yeah, you could tell slightly different tone
[3712.48 - 3713.44] P:1745.48 E:0.026654 |  about the whole thing.
[3713.44 - 3717.80] P:2041.71 E:0.069175 |  I put it to you that if this was a straight shootout,
[3717.80 - 3721.48] P:1959.38 E:0.074293 |  win or bust, do or die, then Scotland is still the underdogs,
[3721.48 - 3723.20] P:1824.53 E:0.080440 |  not least because of their record against Ireland,
[3723.20 - 3723.88] P:1960.79 E:0.079956 |  which is horrible.
[3723.88 - 3726.12] P:1926.96 E:0.067338 |  But when you add the extra layer,
[3726.12 - 3729.80] P:1720.73 E:0.071679 |  the fact they need to win most probably by more than eight points,
[3729.80 - 3732.08] P:1991.01 E:0.062223 |  does that turn it from mission
[3732.12 - 3735.52] P:1802.86 E:0.069941 |  improbable to nearer mission impossible?
[3735.52 - 3738.96] P:2063.49 E:0.057270 |  Well, it's certainly mission improbable.
[3738.96 - 3740.48] P:1931.70 E:0.048701 |  That's for sure.
[3740.48 - 3742.48] P:2029.72 E:0.100591 |  You know, you look at the record, as you say,
[3742.48 - 3745.36] P:2173.17 E:0.086017 |  they've lost eight in a row against Ireland,
[3745.36 - 3749.88] P:2095.26 E:0.069623 |  202 points to 88 over those eight games,
[3749.88 - 3754.20] P:2165.36 E:0.065343 |  24 Irish tries to eight Scotland tries,
[3754.20 - 3757.96] P:1898.11 E:0.096867 |  average score of 25-11 in Ireland's favour.
[3757.96 - 3762.28] P:1968.53 E:0.058080 |  So, you know, it's tricky.
[3762.28 - 3763.36] P:1784.82 E:0.103032 |  Is it impossible?
[3763.36 - 3766.40] P:1917.72 E:0.078593 |  Well, a lot of people would say it's the closest thing
[3766.40 - 3767.60] P:1671.85 E:0.093992 |  you're going to get to impossible
[3767.60 - 3770.92] P:1827.70 E:0.084698 |  because the role that Ireland are on, 16 in a row,
[3770.92 - 3775.36] P:1956.22 E:0.063005 |  as we all know, Scotland haven't beaten Ireland
[3775.36 - 3778.28] P:1798.52 E:0.102143 |  by the margin that they require since 2001
[3778.28 - 3780.88] P:2092.31 E:0.030870 |  in a competitive game.
[3780.88 - 3781.80] P:1975.19 E:0.090827 |  So...
[3781.80 - 3782.48] P:1659.80 E:0.025649 |  That's a while.
[3782.48 - 3783.84] P:1930.98 E:0.047990 |  Yeah, it's...
[3783.84 - 3785.92] P:2010.75 E:0.065503 |  But then again, you look at it, I mean,
[3785.96 - 3788.76] P:2197.94 E:0.087745 |  it's only New Zealand over the last three years
[3788.76 - 3790.76] P:1967.19 E:0.080491 |  have beaten Ireland by eight points,
[3790.76 - 3792.36] P:2012.62 E:0.040058 |  the margin that Scotland need.
[3792.36 - 3796.88] P:2108.53 E:0.060469 |  Only one team in close to three years have done this.
[3796.88 - 3801.96] P:2070.51 E:0.060344 |  So, it's massive task, massive, massive task for Scotland.
[3801.96 - 3805.04] P:1976.13 E:0.062779 |  But, you know, they have a puncturous chance.
[3805.04 - 3807.12] P:2188.51 E:0.034620 |  They need to take their chances.
[3807.12 - 3809.08] P:1951.46 E:0.101928 |  And you can download the full podcast
[3809.08 - 3810.92] P:1669.19 E:0.089289 |  right now at BBC Sounds.
[3810.92 - 3812.52] P:1812.31 E:0.106987 |  And there will be live commentary
[3812.52 - 3814.68] P:2001.29 E:0.074683 |  of that match between Scotland and Ireland
[3814.68 - 3817.84] P:1973.62 E:0.079613 |  on Radio 5 on Saturday evening.
[3817.84 - 3819.88] P:1888.95 E:0.108656 |  We'll be heading back to Old Trafford,
[3819.88 - 3823.00] P:1922.49 E:0.082403 |  very shortly where the second half is about to get underway
[3823.00 - 3825.56] P:1891.52 E:0.094252 |  between Manchester United and Galatasaray.
[3825.56 - 3828.48] P:1999.46 E:0.087722 |  And in fact, the players lining up ahead of kickoff
[3828.48 - 3832.24] P:2114.89 E:0.093154 |  for the second half, Manchester United set to make a change
[3832.24 - 3834.96] P:1921.66 E:0.077307 |  with news of that, your commentary team at Old Trafford.
[3834.96 - 3836.96] P:1919.74 E:0.093727 |  Is he Christensen? Any in Dennis?
[3836.96 - 3837.88] P:1904.72 E:0.053172 |  Yes, thank you, Kelly.
[3837.88 - 3840.72] P:1880.07 E:0.099749 |  Christian Erickson has replaced Hannibal
[3840.72 - 3842.48] P:1835.98 E:0.083828 |  at the start of the second half.
[3842.48 - 3844.72] P:1884.18 E:0.101988 |  Galatasaray yet to make any changes.
[3844.72 - 3846.16] P:1874.05 E:0.105706 |  There's the referee's whistle.
[3846.16 - 3848.20] P:1863.49 E:0.111208 |  And we're back underway.
[3848.20 - 3851.56] P:1943.07 E:0.097274 |  Talking of changes, as I'm just going to go a little bit off-piece,
[3851.56 - 3855.44] P:1818.64 E:0.108117 |  there's going to be a change to one of our five-live sport regulars.
[3855.44 - 3859.96] P:1765.87 E:0.105413 |  So, not only is she a producer, she's been a presenter and a reporter,
[3859.96 - 3861.68] P:1868.93 E:0.100189 |  but Juliet Farrington, it's the last time
[3861.68 - 3863.88] P:1776.36 E:0.095377 |  that we are sadly working with her tonight.
[3863.88 - 3869.04] P:1923.56 E:0.092424 |  She moves off to Passages New, much loved, deeply respected.
[3869.04 - 3871.48] P:1861.17 E:0.083982 |  I don't know, I speak from everybody.
[3872.72 - 3875.52] P:1917.06 E:0.099789 |  From not just the football team, but for five-live sport,
[3875.52 - 3878.64] P:1936.25 E:0.086196 |  to say Jules, you will be missed.
[3878.64 - 3881.48] P:1790.41 E:0.107292 |  Anyway, we're back underway here at Old Trafford.
[3881.48 - 3885.44] P:1796.52 E:0.100212 |  1-1 in this Champions League game with O'Nanaharangol,
[3885.44 - 3889.64] P:1841.27 E:0.091783 |  Dallow, Varan, Lindolf and Amrabat is the defence.
[3889.64 - 3896.20] P:1886.42 E:0.087395 |  Fernandez, Casamiro and Mount with Erickson, Hoyland and Rashford.
[3896.20 - 3899.16] P:1828.26 E:0.111554 |  As Erickson plays the ball forward to Amrabat.
[3899.24 - 3902.84] P:1791.42 E:0.102178 |  Amrabat with the cross and cleared away by Caladasaray's side
[3902.84 - 3907.64] P:1889.16 E:0.087744 |  that has Musslera in goal, Bué, Badaccia, Sanchez and Angelinho,
[3907.64 - 3913.00] P:1759.07 E:0.085126 |  Ihan, Terera, Zaha, Tete, Actacoglu and Icardi.
[3913.00 - 3915.72] P:1931.68 E:0.103183 |  So, all in white, they're defending the strep for then,
[3915.72 - 3918.96] P:1875.00 E:0.092021 |  they're playing from left to right against the Manchester United side
[3918.96 - 3922.88] P:1820.81 E:0.099492 |  in their red shirts and black shorts from right to left and Rashford.
[3924.12 - 3928.00] P:1879.56 E:0.106939 |  On this near side, holds off Bué and now to Amrabat.
[3928.00 - 3932.04] P:1863.14 E:0.086916 |  He did well, Amrabat with the cross, headed away by Ihan
[3932.04 - 3937.24] P:1836.69 E:0.090902 |  and now at Erickson as Manchester United try and find a way
[3937.24 - 3942.52] P:1829.98 E:0.090345 |  to take them back in front, but it's with Zaha who will run forward.
[3942.52 - 3946.40] P:1755.52 E:0.085190 |  And Zaha, with all his experience, holds on to the ball.
[3946.40 - 3947.40] P:1917.96 E:0.089779 |  Is he Christmas?
[3947.40 - 3949.64] P:1800.06 E:0.082181 |  Yeah, does well, Zaha, just breaking out.
[3949.64 - 3953.12] P:1762.26 E:0.086589 |  Again, kind of a sloppy start for Manchester United.
[3953.12 - 3956.96] P:1838.85 E:0.101268 |  You can really see the thinking from Erickson Hague
[3957.00 - 3961.12] P:1797.73 E:0.094069 |  about bringing Erickson on to instill some control in the central area.
[3961.12 - 3963.52] P:1782.34 E:0.093738 |  Manchester United were starting to lose a grip of the game
[3963.52 - 3965.80] P:1824.66 E:0.075511 |  in the second half in central areas.
[3965.80 - 3967.40] P:1807.69 E:0.095028 |  He also brings a threat from set pieces,
[3967.40 - 3970.88] P:1788.98 E:0.090790 |  which have also been taught tonight by Manchester United's Thunders.
[3972.12 - 3974.88] P:1849.08 E:0.106089 |  Bradford City have equalised at Frenton Park,
[3974.88 - 3978.72] P:1887.19 E:0.095794 |  Tremia 1, Bradford 1, Cambridge 0, Bonsley 3,
[3978.72 - 3980.96] P:1866.64 E:0.106489 |  Portsmouth, the leaders of League One are level.
[3980.96 - 3983.92] P:1860.36 E:0.106725 |  As Ihan wins the ball here for Galatasaray,
[3983.92 - 3987.88] P:1938.55 E:0.102829 |  back to Hague with a shot that was blocked by Varan,
[3987.88 - 3989.12] P:1965.65 E:0.108925 |  creating a bit of a threat.
[3989.12 - 3993.36] P:1915.79 E:0.092622 |  Plymouth 0, Millwall 1 is the latest scorer in the championship.
[3993.36 - 3996.12] P:1841.13 E:0.101707 |  Going to be an interesting second half, this one won a piece.
[3997.24 - 4001.48] P:1791.43 E:0.095977 |  I'll tell you what, Galatasaray should have just scored then.
[4001.48 - 4004.04] P:1824.48 E:0.092520 |  Hague took Olu with the shot.
[4004.04 - 4006.04] P:1867.86 E:0.081775 |  He had Tete on the outside.
[4006.04 - 4008.92] P:1645.33 E:0.091266 |  They've just got into Manchester United's box far too easily.
[4009.92 - 4012.64] P:1779.63 E:0.066012 |  Bué, to Tete.
[4012.64 - 4014.84] P:1876.89 E:0.092758 |  Davison Sanchez formally have taught them.
[4015.72 - 4020.84] P:1871.98 E:0.086392 |  And now with Badak Chop in the centre-circle.
[4020.84 - 4021.96] P:1733.07 E:0.098353 |  That was a poor ball.
[4021.96 - 4025.16] P:1919.54 E:0.095610 |  He's forced Angelinho extremely wide on that far side.
[4025.16 - 4027.56] P:1842.03 E:0.089651 |  The left-back did well to retrieve that situation,
[4027.56 - 4030.56] P:1846.07 E:0.097885 |  but ultimately Manchester United now have won the ball back,
[4030.56 - 4033.80] P:1777.46 E:0.105612 |  and Casamiro hits it early, and Rashford again was making that run.
[4033.80 - 4036.08] P:1890.29 E:0.103004 |  But this time he's made the run from the left-hand side.
[4036.08 - 4038.52] P:1868.70 E:0.105691 |  A diagonal run to the edge of the D and he's outstretched left-boot.
[4038.52 - 4041.96] P:1791.83 E:0.088579 |  He couldn't bring the ball down, and it's into the arms of Mishler.
[4041.96 - 4044.08] P:1914.15 E:0.090821 |  It's a straight pass, diagonal run.
[4045.20 - 4048.04] P:1815.94 E:0.083771 |  Sometimes the other way round.
[4048.04 - 4050.04] P:1775.97 E:0.080139 |  Diagonal run, straight pass.
[4050.04 - 4054.44] P:1828.07 E:0.088102 |  Manchester United just picking up where they left off in the first half,
[4054.44 - 4055.76] P:1841.80 E:0.097974 |  looking to go long early.
[4055.76 - 4058.84] P:1907.80 E:0.066776 |  Catch Galatasaray off guard,
[4058.84 - 4061.88] P:1845.89 E:0.083025 |  getting the likes of Rashford and Hoiland in behind.
[4061.88 - 4066.00] P:1893.89 E:0.111892 |  Zaha, early ball, at Olu with the turn,
[4066.00 - 4068.28] P:1954.57 E:0.101885 |  and he looked for the return ball for Zaha.
[4068.76 - 4071.08] P:1897.61 E:0.113539 |  Zaha's run was being tracked by Dala,
[4071.08 - 4074.48] P:1873.16 E:0.099406 |  and he's put the ball out of play for Rey, a throw on that far side.
[4074.48 - 4079.16] P:1811.39 E:0.095878 |  Galatasaray have started his second half in a threatening manner.
[4081.16 - 4082.24] P:1695.62 E:0.133036 |  They really have one-one.
[4082.24 - 4084.20] P:1911.98 E:0.094149 |  We'll go to Luton Town, Chris Colts.
[4084.20 - 4087.80] P:1633.04 E:0.104867 |  Burnley are 12 minutes away from their first Premier League win of the season,
[4087.80 - 4090.28] P:1698.52 E:0.107206 |  still leading Luton 1-0, but they are hanging on.
[4090.28 - 4092.88] P:1891.91 E:0.098586 |  Luton swam on over the Burnley goal.
[4092.88 - 4094.80] P:1798.44 E:0.094435 |  Colton Morris at the centre of everything.
[4094.80 - 4096.04] P:1764.52 E:0.092318 |  He's just headed wide.
[4096.08 - 4098.28] P:1775.75 E:0.092912 |  Luton come forward again with Tahit Chong.
[4098.28 - 4100.92] P:1742.47 E:0.093764 |  It's out for a throw. Luton-nil, Burnley 1.
[4100.92 - 4105.56] P:1797.17 E:0.104382 |  First win of the season, and it would be a huge boost for Burnley.
[4105.56 - 4108.84] P:1899.42 E:0.095238 |  They think five of their opening seven games
[4108.84 - 4112.12] P:1874.50 E:0.096548 |  were against teams that finished in the top eight last season.
[4112.12 - 4115.64] P:1905.62 E:0.097684 |  So the fixture list certainly wasn't kind to Vincent Kompany's team,
[4115.64 - 4117.88] P:1772.67 E:0.082446 |  so to get a win against Luton,
[4117.88 - 4121.04] P:1916.86 E:0.090934 |  that should have been Luton's first home game of the season,
[4121.04 - 4123.08] P:1700.54 E:0.081417 |  but Kenal the Throne wasn't ready.
[4123.08 - 4126.52] P:1839.38 E:0.086917 |  That's why it's being rescheduled for tonight.
[4126.52 - 4129.40] P:1761.43 E:0.089247 |  For Burnley, that would give them a real lift,
[4129.40 - 4132.52] P:1817.85 E:0.093975 |  and we'll be there on Saturday at Turf, more Burnley against Chelsea,
[4132.52 - 4136.80] P:1896.41 E:0.097627 |  one of four commentaries on another busy weekend of live sport
[4136.80 - 4138.68] P:1840.13 E:0.095854 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4138.68 - 4142.00] P:1902.88 E:0.099266 |  We're also live on BBC Sounds tonight, as well as Radio Manchester.
[4142.00 - 4144.96] P:1978.16 E:0.102118 |  Newport 2, Colchester 1 is the latest scorer in League 2,
[4144.96 - 4148.28] P:1804.17 E:0.091904 |  and more can lead Ackrington by a goal to nil.
[4148.28 - 4150.44] P:1867.84 E:0.095882 |  Three minutes into the second half.
[4150.44 - 4151.88] P:1720.52 E:0.098307 |  It's hoisted high by Varan.
[4151.88 - 4154.84] P:1820.89 E:0.094177 |  Good challenge by Buébis, that aerial duel with Rashford.
[4154.84 - 4158.04] P:1896.66 E:0.106247 |  Now up towards Hoiland, lays it off well to Ericsson.
[4158.04 - 4160.00] P:1872.43 E:0.110476 |  Ericsson spreads the ball out wide.
[4160.00 - 4162.44] P:1827.72 E:0.101636 |  Fernandez on that right-hand side, running forward,
[4162.44 - 4164.12] P:2008.66 E:0.104482 |  edge of the area, shapes the shoot,
[4164.12 - 4166.36] P:1828.79 E:0.097246 |  always on the rise off his left boot,
[4166.36 - 4169.12] P:1809.06 E:0.097985 |  and it's off target, and it's a goal kick, and it remains 1-1.
[4169.12 - 4171.96] P:1859.04 E:0.089808 |  Again, it's Hoiland pinning the centre-backs.
[4173.20 - 4175.48] P:1858.09 E:0.110244 |  Looking for runners off him, it's Ericsson that runs off him,
[4175.48 - 4177.48] P:1761.88 E:0.095591 |  plays the ball out to Bruno Fernandez.
[4177.48 - 4179.96] P:1651.92 E:0.073992 |  Bruno Fernandez is cut inside,
[4180.00 - 4182.92] P:1813.22 E:0.103013 |  and he's got the overlapping run from Diego Dallo,
[4182.92 - 4184.92] P:1781.10 E:0.078211 |  which I think he should have played.
[4187.28 - 4190.48] P:1911.76 E:0.098680 |  Let's get an update from Lance Arsenal, Alistair Bruce-Ball.
[4190.48 - 4192.28] P:1718.35 E:0.111445 |  Five minutes gone in the second half.
[4192.28 - 4194.28] P:1767.98 E:0.106922 |  Arsenal nearly getting themselves back in front.
[4194.28 - 4197.48] P:1826.43 E:0.108731 |  Gabrielle Jézus won the ball high up the field.
[4197.48 - 4200.16] P:1779.67 E:0.102834 |  Fedeleandro Trossard on the left, cut onto his right foot.
[4200.16 - 4202.08] P:1794.46 E:0.102679 |  His shot was saved by Samba,
[4202.08 - 4204.44] P:1673.40 E:0.112735 |  and then the rebound from the save hit Kevin Danso,
[4204.44 - 4206.32] P:1493.03 E:0.112767 |  and very nearly ended up in his own net.
[4206.32 - 4208.24] P:1683.94 E:0.106071 |  Samba scrambled another save in there.
[4208.24 - 4209.48] P:1456.48 E:0.097076 |  Lance won Arsenal 1.
[4209.48 - 4211.92] P:1803.39 E:0.102074 |  Arsenal on Matchday 3, travel to Spain,
[4211.92 - 4216.40] P:1717.14 E:0.089316 |  now play Sevilla in the beautiful city of Sevilla,
[4216.40 - 4218.32] P:1794.61 E:0.094261 |  and Sevilla have just taken the lead in the Netherlands.
[4218.32 - 4220.68] P:1854.84 E:0.096227 |  PSB Eindhoven nil, Sevilla 1.
[4220.68 - 4223.08] P:1931.29 E:0.095204 |  So as it stands, both of those sides, Sevilla and Arsenal,
[4223.08 - 4226.36] P:1919.72 E:0.080280 |  would have four points in Group B.
[4226.36 - 4229.40] P:1930.54 E:0.095976 |  Manchester United would still have some work to do
[4229.40 - 4231.92] P:1844.53 E:0.099758 |  if they were to be held here by Galatasaray,
[4231.92 - 4234.68] P:1947.50 E:0.097577 |  elsewhere in League One, Charlton 2, Exeter 1,
[4234.68 - 4236.64] P:1779.45 E:0.086128 |  Northampton 2, Reading 1,
[4236.64 - 4237.96] P:1782.88 E:0.101669 |  and you're up to date with the goals
[4237.96 - 4239.84] P:1730.54 E:0.106093 |  as they go in on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4239.84 - 4243.08] P:1864.92 E:0.094214 |  5 Live final score is available on the red button
[4243.08 - 4245.08] P:1910.53 E:0.100522 |  and also on the BBC Sport website,
[4245.08 - 4249.40] P:1875.60 E:0.083898 |  but Galatasaray, all in white, playing from left to right.
[4249.40 - 4252.08] P:1834.41 E:0.094943 |  Look, a very confident side in this second half, is he, Christensen?
[4252.08 - 4257.48] P:1758.70 E:0.093048 |  Yeah, they've picked up where they finished the first half really.
[4257.48 - 4260.16] P:1776.32 E:0.104088 |  Stein to combine, Tete's getting into the game.
[4260.16 - 4263.40] P:1892.98 E:0.104579 |  Tete to Bouet, starting to show a little bit more ambition as well,
[4263.40 - 4266.44] P:1916.22 E:0.110022 |  and Bouet, with a back heel, is going to win a corner
[4266.48 - 4269.32] P:1917.76 E:0.104575 |  off the shins of Amrabat on this right-hand side,
[4269.32 - 4271.28] P:1914.75 E:0.089449 |  so a corner kick to Galatasaray.
[4271.28 - 4274.28] P:1798.05 E:0.096050 |  That's probably the first time we've seen Tete and Bouet combining,
[4274.28 - 4278.32] P:1764.05 E:0.096794 |  a little bit like Angelino and Zaha on the other side,
[4278.32 - 4282.60] P:1686.96 E:0.107661 |  and that run from Bouet received an applause from his team-mates
[4282.60 - 4285.76] P:1635.67 E:0.090116 |  who are warming up on the side, the Galatasaray substitutes.
[4285.76 - 4289.40] P:1852.99 E:0.111530 |  The fists being thrust into the air by the Galatasaray supporters,
[4289.40 - 4292.60] P:1856.33 E:0.083186 |  decked in Claret and Amber, out swinging corner.
[4292.60 - 4296.04] P:1881.60 E:0.099451 |  The card is headed, it gets a touch to it, it goes away from goal,
[4296.04 - 4300.08] P:1910.89 E:0.104821 |  collected on the far side, this is Zaha trying to dance his way in,
[4300.08 - 4302.12] P:1901.53 E:0.111255 |  goes to ground another challenge with Dallo,
[4302.12 - 4304.72] P:1856.51 E:0.112270 |  wagging a finger by the referee from Slovakia,
[4304.72 - 4308.20] P:1882.95 E:0.112656 |  and then Dallo looking to try and get Ericsson, who plays it first time.
[4308.20 - 4310.88] P:1905.67 E:0.111234 |  First touch, Rashford round the back, Flats stays down,
[4310.88 - 4314.84] P:1936.48 E:0.116126 |  Rashford got support for Nandes, squares the ball, and it's squandered.
[4316.04 - 4320.52] P:1856.49 E:0.107471 |  You're thinking, does he square it, does he go for goal?
[4320.52 - 4325.08] P:1895.90 E:0.102913 |  And in the end, that hesitation, by the time he's squared it,
[4325.08 - 4328.76] P:1918.57 E:0.095131 |  Bouet is back and turns it behind for a corner kick,
[4328.76 - 4332.24] P:1912.04 E:0.104936 |  and what a chance that wasn't taken by Manchester United.
[4332.24 - 4333.76] P:1890.52 E:0.095524 |  You want to know something?
[4333.76 - 4336.92] P:1861.48 E:0.101572 |  I can't figure out whether the recovery run from Bouet was exceptional,
[4336.92 - 4340.16] P:1916.33 E:0.104098 |  or it was just a poor, poor decision for Marcus Rashford.
[4340.16 - 4343.32] P:1729.12 E:0.099353 |  But either way, this counterattack, it comes from Ericsson,
[4343.32 - 4348.68] P:1659.30 E:0.097333 |  the ball around the corner to the run of Rashford over, beyond Angelina.
[4348.68 - 4350.80] P:1914.57 E:0.106157 |  Rashford, the only reason I can think he hasn't shot
[4350.80 - 4353.28] P:1888.41 E:0.087476 |  is because the angle is a little bit tight,
[4353.28 - 4355.72] P:1889.68 E:0.093180 |  but nonetheless, that ball needs to hit the back of the net.
[4355.72 - 4360.16] P:1924.96 E:0.104774 |  Corner taken, and then it calls to mount, and he hits it right foot in effort.
[4360.16 - 4362.40] P:1956.08 E:0.097989 |  That's tipped over by Mouslera.
[4362.40 - 4366.24] P:1936.52 E:0.102595 |  It was a comfortable save. Mouslera watched it all the way.
[4366.24 - 4370.32] P:1895.09 E:0.107917 |  It was dropping, but he's still required his right hand to come around
[4370.32 - 4372.96] P:1927.56 E:0.094266 |  and turn it behind for a corner kick.
[4372.96 - 4377.20] P:2028.44 E:0.104572 |  Manchester United won, Galatasaray won, nine minutes into the second half.
[4377.20 - 4381.24] P:2060.38 E:0.097451 |  Corner kick that Nandes waits to take on that far side, the right.
[4381.28 - 4384.52] P:2053.59 E:0.107669 |  The white shirts are back at plenty inside their own penalty area.
[4384.52 - 4388.00] P:1949.53 E:0.091268 |  Right footed, outswinger, Casamiro's up, Amrabat lays it off.
[4388.00 - 4389.80] P:1921.04 E:0.110003 |  The referee gets in the way.
[4389.80 - 4391.44] P:1813.68 E:0.108324 |  It's going to be an uncontested drop ball.
[4391.44 - 4393.84] P:1855.63 E:0.099589 |  He puts his hands in the way as the referee can't do that.
[4393.84 - 4395.24] P:1891.49 E:0.052844 |  It's an innocent mistake.
[4395.24 - 4398.04] P:1876.78 E:0.100554 |  And he's going to give an uncontested drop ball to Manchester United.
[4398.04 - 4399.56] P:1717.21 E:0.104273 |  Goal at Portman Road, Aaron Paul.
[4399.56 - 4402.28] P:1803.29 E:0.113120 |  Ipswich 3, Hallnill, door terse on the left-hand side of the box.
[4402.28 - 4404.68] P:1899.09 E:0.091275 |  Fizzed the ball across the face of Gollick.
[4404.68 - 4407.96] P:1910.97 E:0.091789 |  It took a deflection, excuse me, Velta Marcus, Harness,
[4408.00 - 4410.20] P:1639.41 E:0.098081 |  and who, well, he tapped in from four yards out.
[4410.20 - 4411.32] P:1818.77 E:0.071895 |  Ipswich 3, Hallnill.
[4411.32 - 4413.32] P:1901.07 E:0.103731 |  Did that late pressure for Luton pay off?
[4413.32 - 4415.20] P:1977.09 E:0.095453 |  There's been a goal, Chris Coles.
[4415.20 - 4418.60] P:1714.99 E:0.107225 |  It has paid off Luton's relentless pressure,
[4418.60 - 4423.20] P:1865.32 E:0.100322 |  has got a reward, 1-1, Elijah Adabayo back from goal.
[4423.20 - 4425.96] P:1965.36 E:0.100870 |  Goodness gracious, what a goal for Burnley.
[4425.96 - 4427.32] P:1834.61 E:0.082957 |  They're back in front.
[4427.32 - 4430.56] P:1906.66 E:0.105937 |  That is a world-class strike from Jakob Brun Larson,
[4430.56 - 4432.12] P:1859.70 E:0.101993 |  right into the top corner,
[4432.12 - 4435.40] P:1936.24 E:0.099774 |  just moments after Adabayo had equalised for Luton.
[4435.40 - 4436.72] P:1858.81 E:0.103804 |  Five minutes to play.
[4436.72 - 4439.16] P:1889.31 E:0.090886 |  It's Luton 1, Burnley 2.
[4439.16 - 4442.04] P:1950.66 E:0.102796 |  So, dramatic stuff in that Premier League game,
[4442.04 - 4443.96] P:1833.34 E:0.101698 |  and in Naples in the Champions League,
[4443.96 - 4448.00] P:1886.41 E:0.101756 |  Napoli 2, Real Madrid 2 is at a latest score,
[4448.00 - 4452.84] P:1949.64 E:0.088122 |  and Curtis Davis has been sent off for Cheltenham.
[4452.84 - 4457.00] P:1919.25 E:0.103205 |  So, Cheltenham, who still yet to score,
[4457.00 - 4460.08] P:1916.30 E:0.087377 |  they're training at home to Fleetwood.
[4460.08 - 4463.52] P:1909.00 E:0.087121 |  So, that would be 11 games
[4463.52 - 4468.72] P:1879.75 E:0.096029 |  without a goal this season in Ligue 1 for the Liga Cheltenham,
[4468.72 - 4471.16] P:1792.04 E:0.093557 |  now down to 10 men.
[4471.16 - 4474.36] P:2045.02 E:0.106820 |  Bolton 2, Stevenage 2 is the latest score, also in that division.
[4474.36 - 4475.96] P:1808.81 E:0.106083 |  And in Manchester United's group,
[4475.96 - 4478.84] P:1879.19 E:0.097961 |  I said that Copenhagen were a tough side on home soil.
[4478.84 - 4481.24] P:1917.36 E:0.094412 |  They're now leading Bayern Munich by a goal to nil.
[4481.24 - 4483.96] P:1884.16 E:0.101150 |  Copenhagen 1, Bayern 0.
[4483.96 - 4486.44] P:1921.38 E:0.111313 |  Manchester United, they have to win this game.
[4486.44 - 4489.16] P:1853.75 E:0.098794 |  They're going to be playing catch-up otherwise in Group A.
[4489.16 - 4491.36] P:1803.02 E:0.108939 |  Fernandez, early ball in from the right-hand side,
[4491.40 - 4493.48] P:1867.83 E:0.099173 |  look towards Mount, picked up by Miss Lara.
[4493.48 - 4495.20] P:1874.05 E:0.102620 |  10 minutes into the second half, is he?
[4495.20 - 4496.68] P:1854.28 E:0.110012 |  1-1, you can feel the frustration.
[4496.68 - 4499.24] P:1977.92 E:0.095581 |  I'll tell you what, a lot has just happened in this last 60 seconds.
[4499.24 - 4501.40] P:1949.31 E:0.097835 |  The referee's just got in the way again
[4501.40 - 4502.92] P:1973.80 E:0.094365 |  to Christian Erikson's frustration.
[4502.92 - 4504.52] P:1951.08 E:0.087572 |  Manchester United are on the attack.
[4504.52 - 4507.16] P:1899.13 E:0.101323 |  And moments before that, I was watching on the far side,
[4507.16 - 4511.60] P:1927.52 E:0.091597 |  Bruno Fernandez and Diogo Dallo having a feisty exchange,
[4511.60 - 4513.32] P:1856.21 E:0.103457 |  and that's from all the way over here.
[4513.32 - 4515.84] P:1806.65 E:0.083975 |  God knows what it was like for the fans on the opposite side.
[4515.84 - 4517.88] P:1835.51 E:0.108457 |  Increasing frustration, Manchester United.
[4517.88 - 4520.20] P:1829.70 E:0.106816 |  Well, here is Hoylan, leaves it to Rashford.
[4520.20 - 4523.00] P:1866.29 E:0.100681 |  Rashford with the back heel. Hoylan works it out towards the right.
[4523.00 - 4525.76] P:1916.75 E:0.101485 |  Fernandez back towards Rashford, pops up on the right-hand side.
[4525.76 - 4527.84] P:1948.02 E:0.102100 |  This time he goes for goal, fires it in.
[4528.84 - 4531.80] P:1906.78 E:0.116745 |  Sometimes Marcus Rashford has been guilty of actually going for goal
[4531.80 - 4533.64] P:1880.01 E:0.104968 |  rather than looking for Hoylan in recent weeks,
[4533.64 - 4536.20] P:1851.29 E:0.110918 |  and on the time that he did look towards Bruno Fernandez
[4536.20 - 4537.52] P:1874.77 E:0.100686 |  rather than going for goal,
[4537.52 - 4539.60] P:1916.26 E:0.104838 |  again, it's that decision-making you were talking about.
[4539.60 - 4542.56] P:1911.84 E:0.097266 |  It's exactly that, Denner, but I'll tell you what else it is.
[4542.56 - 4547.52] P:1943.76 E:0.090525 |  It's the decision-making on the type of cross Marcus Rashford delivers,
[4547.52 - 4550.88] P:1959.71 E:0.096636 |  because on that occasion he tries to fire it across goal,
[4550.88 - 4553.92] P:1883.40 E:0.089251 |  a bit similar to what he did for the assist in the first half,
[4553.92 - 4556.48] P:1861.28 E:0.088238 |  but the dink to the back post if he got his head up,
[4556.48 - 4559.00] P:1861.99 E:0.095009 |  Christian Eriksson was free at the back post unmarked.
[4560.52 - 4563.56] P:1884.46 E:0.114568 |  This isn't Christian, some of this here on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4563.56 - 4565.92] P:1931.17 E:0.099138 |  Terair is down, there's a stoppage in play.
[4565.92 - 4569.64] P:1899.07 E:0.104544 |  Blackpool, Nill, Derby, two is the latest score in League One,
[4569.64 - 4571.84] P:1907.94 E:0.093187 |  and at Brunton Park also in League One.
[4571.84 - 4573.92] P:1836.08 E:0.112921 |  Peter Brunnenyton have just taken the lead.
[4574.72 - 4577.60] P:1828.89 E:0.112089 |  I think the frustration is being added to because of Terair,
[4577.60 - 4579.52] P:1775.48 E:0.100240 |  they probably think it's a bit of gamesmanship,
[4579.52 - 4581.24] P:1755.81 E:0.101566 |  so there's a stoppage in play here,
[4581.24 - 4583.20] P:1827.07 E:0.110601 |  but he is feeling his groin on his right side.
[4583.20 - 4586.48] P:1690.57 E:0.096114 |  Let's go find out how Arsenal are doing in France.
[4586.48 - 4588.08] P:1762.74 E:0.076357 |  Alistair Bruce Ball.
[4588.08 - 4590.20] P:1709.32 E:0.114855 |  Just over 12 minutes played in the second half,
[4590.20 - 4592.20] P:1799.37 E:0.114994 |  still longs one Arsenal one.
[4592.20 - 4595.16] P:1760.53 E:0.108686 |  It's become quite an even game at the start of this second half,
[4595.16 - 4598.64] P:1794.85 E:0.107681 |  but Arsenal closest to getting back in front in the early stages
[4598.64 - 4599.52] P:1543.97 E:0.101879 |  after the break.
[4599.52 - 4601.04] P:1897.45 E:0.090744 |  Trossard's shot saved,
[4601.04 - 4604.28] P:1720.19 E:0.108516 |  and then very nearly went in for an own goal off Danso.
[4604.28 - 4607.00] P:1758.54 E:0.105325 |  Longs attacking as I speak, but it's longs one Arsenal one.
[4607.00 - 4608.68] P:1744.78 E:0.110704 |  We're on air until 10.30 tonight,
[4608.68 - 4611.48] P:1730.37 E:0.107189 |  then of course it's Colin Murray on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4611.48 - 4614.20] P:1755.50 E:0.107635 |  Any reaction that we're unable to bring you before half-ten
[4614.20 - 4616.68] P:1725.86 E:0.105979 |  will be on the 5 Live Football Daily Podcast.
[4616.68 - 4619.16] P:1712.26 E:0.110248 |  Remember, there's a rugby union daily podcast every day
[4619.16 - 4621.16] P:1760.93 E:0.102756 |  for the Rugby Union World Cup.
[4621.16 - 4622.48] P:1821.86 E:0.109666 |  Tomorrow night, Newcastle Paris,
[4622.48 - 4623.96] P:1837.86 E:0.103065 |  San Germain and the Champions League.
[4623.96 - 4626.48] P:1845.15 E:0.093935 |  The Cricket World Cup starts on Thursday,
[4626.48 - 4628.72] P:1888.88 E:0.109287 |  ball by ball commentary in England against New Zealand
[4628.72 - 4630.64] P:1853.53 E:0.091830 |  on Sports Extra from 9.30.
[4630.64 - 4633.36] P:1745.21 E:0.102093 |  We'll have France, Italy and the Rugby Union World Cup on Friday,
[4633.36 - 4637.64] P:1885.43 E:0.095934 |  and then on Saturday it's a mixture of football and live rugby union
[4637.64 - 4638.92] P:1823.26 E:0.099879 |  from 3 o'clock.
[4638.92 - 4641.44] P:1894.95 E:0.104011 |  And then in fact with the boxing, I think 5 Live Sports on air
[4641.44 - 4643.16] P:1841.81 E:0.105613 |  for about 12 hours on Saturday.
[4643.16 - 4646.28] P:1835.54 E:0.117255 |  But we're back underway, and we're 12 minutes into the second half,
[4646.28 - 4649.20] P:1846.07 E:0.108265 |  and the atmosphere has been ramped up inside Old Trafford.
[4649.20 - 4652.96] P:1838.68 E:0.098390 |  The Manchester United fans now are trying to play their part here.
[4652.96 - 4655.32] P:1819.52 E:0.110215 |  Because remember, Copenhagen are leading,
[4655.32 - 4658.80] P:1905.91 E:0.111129 |  the draw is going to leave Manchester United
[4658.92 - 4661.08] P:1895.43 E:0.118639 |  struggling in the early stages of Group A.
[4661.08 - 4667.24] P:1838.41 E:0.094157 |  And for only the third time in the Champions League campaign,
[4667.24 - 4669.08] P:1877.38 E:0.114846 |  they will be witnessing their opening two matches,
[4669.08 - 4670.92] P:1926.33 E:0.112926 |  Casamiro to Mount Highland.
[4670.92 - 4674.08] P:1974.44 E:0.121636 |  Highland stares himself, brilliant finish by Highland.
[4674.08 - 4676.40] P:1878.19 E:0.117101 |  In front of the stripper then, but the flag is up,
[4676.40 - 4679.84] P:1892.80 E:0.110922 |  and the celebrations are cut short, offside.
[4679.84 - 4681.80] P:1938.04 E:0.114630 |  Highland with a check, the first touch,
[4681.80 - 4683.32] P:1882.62 E:0.109105 |  shook it away from Bouet,
[4683.32 - 4686.04] P:1853.92 E:0.105282 |  raffled the ball into the back of the net, left footed.
[4686.04 - 4688.12] P:1900.22 E:0.111377 |  But the celebrations quickly cut short,
[4688.12 - 4690.08] P:1873.97 E:0.094598 |  and it's still 1-1.
[4690.08 - 4692.32] P:1922.79 E:0.099664 |  VAR will naturally have a check,
[4692.32 - 4695.32] P:1849.70 E:0.109139 |  but it looks like they're already looking to take the free kick
[4695.32 - 4697.12] P:1851.26 E:0.086488 |  for Galatasaray.
[4697.12 - 4698.48] P:1782.93 E:0.113214 |  He's pointing at himself, Highland.
[4698.48 - 4702.12] P:1790.96 E:0.092900 |  Was it me that was offside? We're just watching the replay.
[4702.12 - 4703.24] P:1730.38 E:0.109378 |  He's offside.
[4703.24 - 4705.16] P:1914.40 E:0.099450 |  Yes, he is. It's tight, but he is offside.
[4705.16 - 4708.00] P:1726.77 E:0.086847 |  But I'll tell you what, the finish, the footwork inside the box,
[4708.00 - 4710.12] P:1928.84 E:0.105983 |  was exquisite, and I know it's offside, it's Dysalao,
[4710.12 - 4711.52] P:1629.96 E:0.080763 |  but that'll give him confidence.
[4711.52 - 4714.32] P:1814.66 E:0.092756 |  He's been exceptional tonight, Rasmus Highland.
[4714.32 - 4716.48] P:1829.82 E:0.100483 |  There'll be more to come from him, I'm sure.
[4716.52 - 4718.52] P:1861.32 E:0.098866 |  So that goal, Dysalao.
[4718.52 - 4721.60] P:1773.01 E:0.108850 |  There's been a smoke bomb or something been set off
[4721.60 - 4726.08] P:1798.49 E:0.107832 |  in the jumping Galatasaray supporters away towards our right.
[4726.08 - 4728.64] P:1855.87 E:0.115459 |  You can clearly smell the sulphur,
[4728.64 - 4732.12] P:1810.63 E:0.106141 |  you can see it drifting in the lights here at Old Trafford.
[4732.12 - 4735.04] P:1855.43 E:0.114588 |  And Manchester United supporters are trying to do their bit as well.
[4735.04 - 4738.20] P:1838.84 E:0.104067 |  So it's a cracking atmosphere here at Old Trafford.
[4738.20 - 4743.84] P:1865.76 E:0.106921 |  For this 25th appearance in the group stages of the Champions League,
[4743.88 - 4747.28] P:1858.21 E:0.111899 |  Manchester United, Ericsson to Amrabat.
[4747.28 - 4749.28] P:1898.07 E:0.122008 |  There's going to be a double change being made.
[4749.28 - 4754.04] P:1855.98 E:0.109174 |  That was a foul on Amrabat by Bué, and he is shown a yellow card.
[4754.04 - 4757.16] P:1857.46 E:0.094411 |  He's the second Galatasaray player to be shown yellow
[4757.16 - 4759.80] P:1799.21 E:0.077360 |  by the Slovakian referee.
[4759.80 - 4762.84] P:1836.09 E:0.102057 |  But a double change, and we're going to see Sergio Alvera,
[4762.84 - 4764.76] P:1862.62 E:0.090426 |  Portuguese international.
[4764.76 - 4768.36] P:1803.53 E:0.101934 |  We're also going to see Baras Yilmaz,
[4768.36 - 4771.44] P:1849.94 E:0.111078 |  who's going to be coming on, who's a striker.
[4771.44 - 4773.80] P:1860.53 E:0.106746 |  So this is where the changes are made.
[4773.80 - 4777.72] P:1835.75 E:0.118512 |  So Terreira is one of the players coming off.
[4779.56 - 4781.56] P:1743.92 E:0.116367 |  And then the other one is going to be Tete.
[4781.56 - 4785.64] P:1761.97 E:0.108060 |  So Alvera will just replace Terreira in the midfield.
[4785.64 - 4788.48] P:1763.49 E:0.113052 |  He joined last season from Porto,
[4788.48 - 4791.36] P:1831.12 E:0.099114 |  won a first title in his first season.
[4791.36 - 4793.52] P:1865.47 E:0.113047 |  And then the other one is going to be Baras Yilmaz,
[4793.52 - 4795.36] P:1884.86 E:0.101402 |  who's a forward to replace Tete.
[4795.36 - 4798.12] P:1897.78 E:0.099005 |  Let's get an update from Ken Othroud and the Premier League. Chris Cole.
[4798.12 - 4802.84] P:1779.69 E:0.100869 |  Luton won Burnley too, but we are into seven minutes of added on time.
[4802.88 - 4805.16] P:1737.95 E:0.099243 |  Burnley doing their best to keep the ball in the Luton half,
[4805.16 - 4807.88] P:1926.96 E:0.097054 |  as J. Rodriguez strikes goalwards and only just wide.
[4807.88 - 4810.88] P:1873.09 E:0.094886 |  Luton need to get this forward, trailing Burnley by two goals to one.
[4810.88 - 4813.00] P:1809.82 E:0.097991 |  Manchester United were attacking on the right-hand side,
[4813.00 - 4815.56] P:1864.58 E:0.103294 |  cleared by Galatasaray, played back in by Ericsson.
[4815.56 - 4819.52] P:1908.00 E:0.106683 |  And the header from the Rashford, who was jumping down with the header,
[4819.52 - 4821.76] P:1950.28 E:0.089472 |  saved by Michelera.
[4821.76 - 4825.72] P:1902.54 E:0.091879 |  That's exactly what Ericsson brings, this first-time ball into the area.
[4825.72 - 4829.24] P:1869.49 E:0.093629 |  Marcus Rashford does really well to attack it in front of Buoy,
[4829.24 - 4831.24] P:1857.53 E:0.100764 |  but he doesn't quite generate enough power.
[4833.24 - 4837.56] P:1780.17 E:0.107502 |  So, Galatasaray with Ocan Burakus made a couple of changes.
[4837.56 - 4841.24] P:1789.77 E:0.098914 |  We've been playing now for nearly an hour here on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4841.24 - 4845.72] P:1888.96 E:0.098674 |  Rashford to Ericsson, ball inside, Casamiro lets it come across his body,
[4845.72 - 4849.40] P:1794.05 E:0.105275 |  runs away from his man, passes the ball out towards Bruno Fernandez.
[4849.40 - 4852.88] P:1918.27 E:0.106080 |  Back to Casamiro, slightly behind him, still gets the shot away, right-footed.
[4852.88 - 4855.68] P:1931.26 E:0.093860 |  Blocked by the Galatasaray defence, picked up by Zaha.
[4855.68 - 4858.20] P:1952.83 E:0.094024 |  Can they break on the counter-attack? Here is Yilmaz,
[4858.20 - 4860.12] P:1945.42 E:0.089517 |  pressed a touch, it passed Amrabat.
[4860.12 - 4862.32] P:1919.53 E:0.094864 |  Amrabat, so much energy.
[4862.32 - 4864.64] P:1859.94 E:0.111512 |  He ran more than any other player in the world,
[4864.64 - 4867.64] P:1921.44 E:0.097758 |  over 50 miles in Qatar.
[4867.64 - 4869.12] P:1866.44 E:0.096305 |  He won't beat him for energy.
[4869.12 - 4871.40] P:1965.57 E:0.099472 |  Manchester United are attacking, nice turn,
[4871.40 - 4873.80] P:1854.84 E:0.108321 |  Mount with a shot, left footed, pulls it wide,
[4873.80 - 4876.16] P:1958.07 E:0.103834 |  but again, much better from Manchester United.
[4876.16 - 4878.64] P:1890.76 E:0.108418 |  They're really starting to pick each other out in the box now.
[4878.64 - 4880.92] P:1906.01 E:0.107506 |  You can feel the response from the fans.
[4880.92 - 4884.48] P:1911.75 E:0.098692 |  It's absolutely electric here in Old Trafford.
[4884.48 - 4886.28] P:1840.56 E:0.110174 |  Manchester United are really feeding off that,
[4886.28 - 4889.28] P:1798.67 E:0.106792 |  they're finding their groove and it's just that cutting edge now.
[4889.28 - 4892.32] P:1826.51 E:0.102979 |  The final product, the composure on the finish,
[4892.32 - 4895.04] P:1792.15 E:0.088912 |  and it was then Mason Mount finding his space inside the box.
[4895.04 - 4898.60] P:1763.22 E:0.090035 |  The turn, the left foot finish, he drags it just wide.
[4898.60 - 4901.08] P:1893.00 E:0.105004 |  Much better for Manchester United.
[4901.08 - 4906.16] P:1861.20 E:0.111966 |  The crowd are feeding off the positive play from Manchester United.
[4906.16 - 4909.92] P:1865.45 E:0.106999 |  A little bit predictable in the first half.
[4909.92 - 4912.28] P:1804.17 E:0.096769 |  All of a sudden, now they...
[4912.28 - 4916.32] P:1764.60 E:0.104509 |  You can sense that goal threat from the home team.
[4916.32 - 4918.28] P:1902.44 E:0.108697 |  Radio 5 live, BBC sounds.
[4918.28 - 4920.08] P:1828.35 E:0.103576 |  Also live on Radio Manchester.
[4920.08 - 4922.92] P:1766.80 E:0.086461 |  Bué clears it long for Galatasaray.
[4922.92 - 4925.32] P:1846.11 E:0.081845 |  61 minutes played.
[4925.32 - 4927.72] P:1896.05 E:0.114054 |  Give you all the latest scores when we can.
[4927.72 - 4932.28] P:1864.19 E:0.086607 |  Blackpool have got a goal back at home to Derby in League One.
[4932.28 - 4934.80] P:1865.55 E:0.100318 |  Carlisle, Nill, Peterborough won, gave you that one.
[4934.80 - 4936.44] P:1989.56 E:0.106821 |  Bolton, three, Stevenage, two.
[4936.44 - 4938.00] P:1869.89 E:0.100021 |  Grimsby, two, Barrow, Nill.
[4938.00 - 4942.08] P:1779.36 E:0.091162 |  Interleading Benfica in San Siro by a goal to Nill.
[4942.08 - 4944.28] P:1591.33 E:0.064865 |  Last year's runners-up.
[4944.28 - 4946.08] P:1661.73 E:0.097374 |  And that's it, we're up today.
[4946.08 - 4948.60] P:1735.90 E:0.100496 |  There's going to be more changes down below for Galatasaray.
[4948.60 - 4951.84] P:1805.42 E:0.094593 |  Bué clears on the half-follie, only as far as Ericsson plays it back.
[4951.84 - 4955.76] P:1800.56 E:0.096129 |  He's over the head of Rashford and out of play, it goes for a throw.
[4955.76 - 4958.16] P:1879.95 E:0.097129 |  But there is still a lot of time, just under half an hour.
[4958.16 - 4960.80] P:1659.25 E:0.079008 |  Yeah, still plenty of time for both sides.
[4960.80 - 4964.44] P:1753.53 E:0.096002 |  We've seen what Galatasaray can do after going a goal behind.
[4964.44 - 4966.56] P:1469.13 E:0.072800 |  They respond well.
[4966.56 - 4969.44] P:1599.49 E:0.086506 |  Game is very much in the balance.
[4969.44 - 4972.32] P:1684.38 E:0.103092 |  Better chances of late, though, from Manchester United.
[4972.32 - 4974.96] P:1829.94 E:0.112335 |  Chris Mertens is going to be coming on.
[4975.00 - 4978.84] P:1801.77 E:0.100161 |  And we're also going to see Vector Nelson, who's a defender.
[4978.84 - 4982.04] P:1801.74 E:0.094955 |  So interesting to see whether they bring on the extra defender
[4982.04 - 4984.60] P:1747.84 E:0.071632 |  and go with three at the back.
[4984.60 - 4986.84] P:1900.81 E:0.102002 |  As the ball is headed away by Sanchez,
[4986.84 - 4990.28] P:1812.92 E:0.075892 |  the former Tottenham man climbed high and headed away.
[4990.28 - 4993.44] P:1894.51 E:0.097010 |  Back to Oulu with the clearance, only as far as that mount.
[4993.44 - 4995.96] P:1852.92 E:0.107387 |  A little flick there by Fernandez up his heel.
[4995.96 - 4997.40] P:1856.97 E:0.095121 |  Takes it away from Angelinho.
[4997.40 - 5000.04] P:1837.80 E:0.084780 |  The rain pouring down once again here at Old Trafford,
[5000.04 - 5002.32] P:1927.15 E:0.095557 |  as Manchester United in their red shirts and black shorts.
[5002.32 - 5004.60] P:1809.09 E:0.089618 |  Play from right to left, one-one, five-live.
[5004.60 - 5006.32] P:1873.23 E:0.102426 |  Casamiro looking for the return ball.
[5006.32 - 5008.00] P:1938.79 E:0.100289 |  It might sit up nicely to Fernandez.
[5008.00 - 5011.28] P:1952.44 E:0.099962 |  Hits it first time right footed, but it was straight, it was later.
[5011.28 - 5013.16] P:1930.60 E:0.092853 |  And that's what you get with Bruno Fernandez
[5013.16 - 5014.88] P:1812.64 E:0.096249 |  playing off the right-hand side.
[5014.88 - 5020.04] P:1921.31 E:0.101500 |  You can just see here now, Galatasaray just taking the sting
[5020.04 - 5021.40] P:2026.50 E:0.094578 |  out of Manchester United.
[5021.40 - 5024.20] P:1881.47 E:0.085434 |  Bruno Fernandez is getting increasingly frustrated,
[5024.20 - 5026.52] P:1784.67 E:0.072967 |  but it was again that man,
[5026.52 - 5030.00] P:1882.22 E:0.095087 |  Baracar, who's just made that defensive clearance
[5030.00 - 5033.52] P:1789.42 E:0.092272 |  from the dink over from Casamiro.
[5033.56 - 5036.08] P:1853.60 E:0.113590 |  Galatasaray just using all the gamesmanship right now.
[5036.08 - 5037.08] P:1766.32 E:0.101242 |  Yeah, they are.
[5037.08 - 5038.48] P:1812.42 E:0.108378 |  And the referee's just said to him,
[5038.48 - 5040.20] P:1852.72 E:0.089466 |  if you want to go off the field, you can do so.
[5040.20 - 5042.16] P:1666.61 E:0.108933 |  But the players now know that you're off the field
[5042.16 - 5043.60] P:1848.45 E:0.096921 |  then for a minimum of 30 seconds.
[5043.60 - 5046.28] P:1833.61 E:0.087075 |  Otherwise, get to your feet, and Badacir does exactly that.
[5046.28 - 5048.68] P:1912.29 E:0.088699 |  Gets to his feet, still that double change
[5048.68 - 5050.80] P:1797.29 E:0.088019 |  waits to be made by Okan Burak.
[5050.80 - 5053.32] P:1888.31 E:0.094400 |  63 minutes play, it's still one-one.
[5053.32 - 5057.24] P:1823.96 E:0.095937 |  Arsenal are still drawing away at Longs, one-one in Group B,
[5057.24 - 5058.96] P:1765.58 E:0.103890 |  where Sevilla lead by Agole Taneel.
[5058.96 - 5060.64] P:1821.65 E:0.095025 |  In this group, Manchester United's group,
[5060.64 - 5063.76] P:1874.76 E:0.100684 |  Copenhagen, are still leading by Amunic by Agole Taneel.
[5063.76 - 5067.00] P:1981.27 E:0.100251 |  Charlton 3, Exeter 1 is the latest scorer in League One.
[5067.00 - 5069.88] P:2011.97 E:0.101786 |  And Cheltenham's for-launch start to the season continues,
[5069.88 - 5072.32] P:1888.27 E:0.094867 |  down to 10 men, and they're still yet to score,
[5072.32 - 5074.24] P:1908.79 E:0.084014 |  and they've conceded again to Fleetwood.
[5074.24 - 5077.80] P:1842.12 E:0.090147 |  Cheltenham-Nil, Fleetwood 2 at the bottom of League One.
[5077.80 - 5081.60] P:1823.59 E:0.075789 |  Five-live with Casamiro, guided header down by Fernandez,
[5081.60 - 5084.08] P:1794.33 E:0.089141 |  to Mason Mount, neatly played by Manchester United.
[5084.08 - 5086.48] P:1836.36 E:0.102330 |  Ericsson midway through his own half, opens it up,
[5086.48 - 5088.68] P:1701.63 E:0.102021 |  Amrabat lets it to run over his head,
[5088.72 - 5090.64] P:1904.46 E:0.111199 |  and Bué with the interception.
[5090.64 - 5092.32] P:1919.81 E:0.099451 |  Did he keep the ball in play?
[5092.32 - 5095.32] P:1887.51 E:0.096860 |  The assistant referee said he did, but Amrabat, by that point,
[5095.32 - 5097.76] P:1832.83 E:0.088158 |  had run back and tarnished it up back towards O'Nanna.
[5097.76 - 5100.36] P:1850.65 E:0.063863 |  His clearance is met by the...
[5100.36 - 5104.56] P:1806.95 E:0.084054 |  Head there of Oliveira in the midfield,
[5104.56 - 5106.04] P:1898.02 E:0.095432 |  with his beard and his ponytail,
[5106.04 - 5108.08] P:1884.93 E:0.109256 |  the Portuguese international Bust experience,
[5108.08 - 5109.32] P:1855.21 E:0.115929 |  but he's given them all away.
[5109.32 - 5111.28] P:1922.78 E:0.108797 |  Sanchez dived in, and Hoylund's away,
[5111.28 - 5112.92] P:1965.96 E:0.102979 |  but that's your trust to get back at Hoylund.
[5112.92 - 5114.40] P:1940.17 E:0.121164 |  Hoylund's away!
[5114.40 - 5116.04] P:2022.91 E:0.117278 |  And Hoylund scores!
[5116.04 - 5117.72] P:1958.91 E:0.124576 |  Clinical finish with Hoylund!
[5118.72 - 5121.28] P:1960.09 E:0.116049 |  And the mistake is punished.
[5121.28 - 5124.12] P:1950.67 E:0.116403 |  Oliveira, very, very costly.
[5124.12 - 5126.16] P:1908.00 E:0.119990 |  And there was only one outcome,
[5126.16 - 5127.84] P:1956.72 E:0.119338 |  and it's Hoylund in the double,
[5127.84 - 5130.48] P:1957.14 E:0.113150 |  as Manchester United are back in front, 2-1.
[5131.68 - 5136.20] P:1887.99 E:0.102501 |  Oliveira came on for Galatasaray to firm things up in the midfield,
[5136.20 - 5138.80] P:1934.88 E:0.112595 |  and he's just completely let one loose.
[5138.80 - 5140.36] P:1934.88 E:0.109928 |  Rasmus Hoylund has sniffed it out,
[5140.36 - 5142.28] P:1869.87 E:0.104393 |  and he's had half the pitch nearly to run.
[5144.76 - 5147.48] P:1884.27 E:0.111976 |  The pace to burn off the defender,
[5147.48 - 5149.12] P:1820.70 E:0.110840 |  and then the dink over the goal key.
[5149.12 - 5151.84] P:1894.15 E:0.105158 |  How many times do we see the finish go in a cross goal?
[5151.84 - 5153.28] P:1951.02 E:0.106250 |  And it doesn't have that lift on it,
[5153.28 - 5156.40] P:1854.02 E:0.105961 |  but that lift on it from Hoylund is absolutely wonderful,
[5156.40 - 5159.24] P:1749.29 E:0.101596 |  because that is what takes it into the back of the net.
[5159.24 - 5161.76] P:1807.77 E:0.117995 |  A fantastic goal for Manchester United's best player tonight
[5161.76 - 5163.56] P:1885.80 E:0.116296 |  so far this evening.
[5163.56 - 5165.92] P:1965.65 E:0.119989 |  He almost scored a goal like that at the weekend,
[5165.92 - 5169.04] P:1936.07 E:0.108510 |  but Tyrek Mitchell was actually able to get back
[5169.04 - 5171.80] P:1898.85 E:0.094334 |  and make the goal line clearance for Crystal Palace.
[5171.80 - 5175.44] P:1939.69 E:0.106478 |  But Badukcere was unable to keep pace with Hoylund.
[5175.44 - 5176.92] P:1947.09 E:0.111955 |  Sanchez had committed himself,
[5176.92 - 5179.16] P:1861.65 E:0.101004 |  but it all came from a mistake from Oliveira.
[5179.16 - 5181.40] P:1916.11 E:0.099811 |  Rashford, incidentally, has gone off.
[5181.40 - 5185.48] P:1810.12 E:0.106947 |  So, Garnaccio has come on to replace Marcus Rashford.
[5185.48 - 5189.04] P:1857.45 E:0.114474 |  We're still yet to see the change being made by Galatasaray,
[5189.04 - 5192.60] P:1875.31 E:0.115705 |  but Manchester United lead by two goals to one,
[5192.60 - 5196.04] P:1805.30 E:0.107501 |  and at the time being, they've changed the mind of bringing on
[5196.04 - 5198.92] P:1780.23 E:0.111007 |  the Danish defender, Nelson,
[5198.92 - 5201.08] P:1849.66 E:0.118763 |  but they may be bringing on Dries Mertens.
[5201.08 - 5202.80] P:1847.24 E:0.111550 |  There hasn't been a restart,
[5202.80 - 5205.84] P:1780.22 E:0.114311 |  because Musslera was injured in the process.
[5205.88 - 5208.40] P:1863.72 E:0.119842 |  But the celebrations here inside Old Trafford,
[5208.40 - 5213.92] P:1837.67 E:0.108240 |  because Hoylund, who's never scored a hat-trick in club football,
[5213.92 - 5216.72] P:1806.96 E:0.108936 |  is now on one for Manchester United.
[5216.72 - 5220.24] P:1701.75 E:0.111832 |  Give him time, and the young Dane will be very, very popular,
[5220.24 - 5221.56] P:1904.48 E:0.091138 |  and he'll score goals.
[5221.56 - 5223.48] P:1873.03 E:0.093483 |  He's got an IPA goal, it's clear to see.
[5223.48 - 5227.88] P:1745.91 E:0.096360 |  You can see there, you can see the level of a strike in those moments.
[5227.88 - 5231.00] P:1807.38 E:0.099894 |  When you've come 1v1 with the goalkeeper, you've got an angle.
[5231.00 - 5232.88] P:1964.78 E:0.102062 |  You're not going straight at the goal, you've got an angle.
[5232.88 - 5234.96] P:1837.95 E:0.085730 |  He had an angle onto the left-hand side.
[5235.00 - 5237.52] P:1833.92 E:0.100111 |  His only option, in my opinion, was to bink it,
[5237.52 - 5239.12] P:1745.24 E:0.085511 |  and that's exactly what he did.
[5239.12 - 5241.96] P:1781.35 E:0.085459 |  Like I said, he's been exceptional this evening.
[5241.96 - 5245.16] P:1722.68 E:0.105099 |  Bayern Munich, incidentally, in Manchester United's group-in-group,
[5245.16 - 5246.68] P:1714.64 E:0.105338 |  they have equalised in Denmark.
[5246.68 - 5248.88] P:1725.80 E:0.099228 |  Kofen Hagen won, Bayern won,
[5248.88 - 5251.56] P:1832.43 E:0.109441 |  Middlesbrough lead Cardiff City by two goals to nil.
[5251.56 - 5254.52] P:1790.60 E:0.102500 |  Michael Karak, for the Manchester United player, of course.
[5254.52 - 5256.52] P:1773.34 E:0.104543 |  His side will be unbeaten in five,
[5256.52 - 5260.08] P:1865.46 E:0.099375 |  as Mason Mount hits an early ball straight through to Musslera,
[5260.08 - 5262.68] P:1923.27 E:0.094721 |  who's able to shake off that knock.
[5262.72 - 5265.12] P:1898.14 E:0.100523 |  So United lead 2-1.
[5265.12 - 5267.12] P:1818.96 E:0.110471 |  Bayern have levelled its 1-1,
[5267.12 - 5269.00] P:1857.62 E:0.104432 |  Sevilla leading in Holland.
[5269.00 - 5270.44] P:1893.22 E:0.097221 |  What about Arsenal in France?
[5270.44 - 5272.28] P:1889.33 E:0.070156 |  Alistair Brucemore.
[5272.28 - 5275.04] P:1796.08 E:0.118353 |  22 minutes to play, it remains longs-won Arsenal,
[5275.04 - 5277.84] P:1823.00 E:0.117326 |  won a chance for eager team in the last few minutes.
[5277.84 - 5279.36] P:1761.80 E:0.109887 |  First for longs-salis Abdul,
[5279.36 - 5281.52] P:1824.57 E:0.107465 |  Sam Edg, shooting into the side netting,
[5281.52 - 5283.80] P:1710.23 E:0.107520 |  and then Tomiasso at the other end for Arsenal.
[5283.80 - 5285.60] P:1886.16 E:0.118447 |  Thought he scored his first goal for the club.
[5285.60 - 5288.20] P:1873.10 E:0.105834 |  Erdogan's corner, brilliant volley from Tomiasso.
[5288.20 - 5289.60] P:1724.66 E:0.105637 |  Well saved, 1-1.
[5289.60 - 5291.40] P:1867.84 E:0.111147 |  Galatasaray should be levelled.
[5291.44 - 5293.72] P:1968.17 E:0.105463 |  Cross played in by Yilmaz on the right.
[5293.72 - 5296.08] P:1959.29 E:0.112872 |  Oh, Nanna should gather this in, but he's dived at it,
[5296.08 - 5298.12] P:1972.49 E:0.097897 |  and all he's done is pushed it to Zaha.
[5298.12 - 5301.20] P:1849.31 E:0.080252 |  Zaha's team up, Aksirk O'Glu,
[5301.20 - 5302.72] P:1985.89 E:0.116765 |  and he's hit it right, put it in wide,
[5302.72 - 5304.24] P:2047.23 E:0.102948 |  and he knows he should have hit the target.
[5304.24 - 5308.24] P:1912.80 E:0.096360 |  Oh, dear, oh, dear, Anana, what on earth are you doing?
[5308.24 - 5310.88] P:1940.38 E:0.091398 |  Like you say, Anana, the ball in from Yilmaz,
[5310.88 - 5314.08] P:1984.67 E:0.094696 |  flashed across that corridor of the six-yard box.
[5314.08 - 5315.08] P:1887.95 E:0.054362 |  The set...
[5316.16 - 5317.96] P:1999.55 E:0.098256 |  The finish is just wide.
[5317.96 - 5319.76] P:1990.91 E:0.090854 |  I'll tell you what, that is close.
[5319.76 - 5322.16] P:2002.24 E:0.096848 |  But Anana, what on earth is he doing?
[5322.16 - 5323.80] P:1929.81 E:0.089094 |  Perring that into the path.
[5323.80 - 5325.32] P:1916.15 E:0.072988 |  I think he's tried to catch it.
[5326.20 - 5328.44] P:1977.39 E:0.110001 |  He's tried to catch it, and he's not connected with the ball,
[5328.44 - 5330.60] P:1918.80 E:0.081923 |  and they are lucky Manchester United.
[5330.60 - 5332.00] P:1848.32 E:0.108628 |  Very, very lucky.
[5332.00 - 5334.64] P:1846.27 E:0.109108 |  Meanwhile, the combination play between Fernandez.
[5334.64 - 5336.44] P:1855.53 E:0.087243 |  Mount now on the right-hand side,
[5336.44 - 5338.92] P:1884.22 E:0.102631 |  Mount's cross, Gannaccio slips, but he still gets there.
[5338.92 - 5341.68] P:1851.38 E:0.100679 |  Edge of the area runs forward inside to Fernandez.
[5341.68 - 5344.24] P:1901.38 E:0.083555 |  Fernandez with a chip towards Hoiland.
[5344.24 - 5347.68] P:1903.60 E:0.090569 |  Cleared away by Badaccio for Galatasaray.
[5347.72 - 5350.12] P:1971.52 E:0.107168 |  Manchester United, much better second half.
[5350.12 - 5351.12] P:1961.80 E:0.096056 |  Greater fluency.
[5351.12 - 5353.12] P:1927.83 E:0.083841 |  Yeah, much more fluency.
[5353.12 - 5355.32] P:1925.11 E:0.097429 |  Still picking up with the principles of the first half.
[5355.32 - 5356.96] P:1879.04 E:0.089917 |  They're flicking it round the corner first time,
[5356.96 - 5358.56] P:1839.97 E:0.079592 |  looking for the space in behind,
[5358.56 - 5361.84] P:1870.87 E:0.090161 |  but they've got to be so, so careful right now, Manchester United.
[5361.84 - 5364.36] P:1809.47 E:0.105365 |  Full time in the Premier League. Chris Coles at Kenilmaz Road.
[5364.36 - 5367.08] P:1813.89 E:0.103911 |  Burnley have their first Premier League win of the season,
[5367.08 - 5371.12] P:1798.55 E:0.095113 |  secured quite brilliantly by Jaco Brun Larson's fine strike from range.
[5371.12 - 5374.84] P:1794.14 E:0.096853 |  Five minutes from time, just moments after Elijah Adderbeau
[5374.84 - 5376.12] P:1723.72 E:0.108534 |  had equalised for Luton.
[5376.16 - 5377.92] P:1752.68 E:0.114336 |  Big win for Vincent Coen and Burnley.
[5377.92 - 5379.84] P:1637.67 E:0.109932 |  Two-one winners at Luton.
[5379.84 - 5383.88] P:1865.96 E:0.116647 |  Galatasaray are level at 2-2 for the second time tonight.
[5383.88 - 5388.04] P:1838.56 E:0.100166 |  They have come from behind, and it is at the foot loop.
[5388.04 - 5390.44] P:1879.15 E:0.120493 |  With the ball, finished it very, very well.
[5390.44 - 5393.80] P:1964.31 E:0.102915 |  Yilmaz has caused problems down the right, his cross,
[5393.80 - 5395.64] P:1958.54 E:0.123972 |  and it was finished very, very well.
[5395.64 - 5398.44] P:1848.25 E:0.103350 |  The flares are being set off in the Galatasaray.
[5398.44 - 5400.68] P:1918.97 E:0.103522 |  End away towards the right-hand side.
[5400.68 - 5404.04] P:1864.08 E:0.095432 |  They've packed Pets Manchester United back again. 2-2.
[5404.04 - 5406.00] P:1777.81 E:0.091526 |  How naive can you be?
[5406.04 - 5408.44] P:1790.84 E:0.103433 |  There was alarm bells ringing moments earlier,
[5408.44 - 5412.88] P:1834.51 E:0.089696 |  and it's that man, Yilmaz, who's just come off the bench and destroyed.
[5412.88 - 5416.00] P:1784.42 E:0.097541 |  And we're back down this left-hand side from Manchester United.
[5416.00 - 5419.96] P:1756.13 E:0.096057 |  And it's just the cross across, and the run from Akta Colu,
[5419.96 - 5422.48] P:1901.87 E:0.091601 |  and the first touch, and the finish across,
[5422.48 - 5424.88] P:1799.87 E:0.089670 |  and Arno into the far-bottom corner.
[5424.88 - 5427.96] P:1821.68 E:0.106421 |  Manchester United, when are they going to learn to control the game
[5427.96 - 5429.28] P:1791.44 E:0.074818 |  and see it out?
[5429.28 - 5432.24] P:1847.48 E:0.109563 |  Took it very, very well on the run, right footed.
[5433.24 - 5437.44] P:1858.02 E:0.103364 |  And Galatasaray, you think, after Hoiland's first goal in the first half,
[5437.44 - 5439.68] P:1950.38 E:0.107630 |  they were back level within six minutes.
[5439.68 - 5445.04] P:1855.22 E:0.096424 |  They were back level within four after Hoiland's second goal in this contest.
[5445.04 - 5447.76] P:1801.21 E:0.098584 |  2-2. Goal in longs.
[5447.76 - 5449.08] P:1842.47 E:0.104555 |  Alistair Bruce-Ball.
[5449.08 - 5451.96] P:1760.66 E:0.103418 |  Arsenal now find themselves behind Tomayasu,
[5451.96 - 5453.96] P:1592.99 E:0.112064 |  very nearly giving them the lead.
[5453.96 - 5456.76] P:1812.61 E:0.105328 |  Two minutes later, a fabulous finish from Elie Wahid,
[5456.76 - 5458.52] P:1804.11 E:0.099029 |  a young centre forward for Longs,
[5458.52 - 5460.56] P:1747.17 E:0.105046 |  crossing from the right-medic first time.
[5460.56 - 5464.00] P:1711.38 E:0.105648 |  And David Ray didn't stand a chance, Longs to Arsenal, one.
[5464.00 - 5467.56] P:1667.53 E:0.106410 |  Excellent result. This would be for Galatasaray.
[5467.56 - 5471.72] P:1619.82 E:0.108926 |  You can hear for yourselves what the Galatasaray travelling support
[5471.72 - 5473.56] P:1662.80 E:0.102110 |  make of it.
[5473.56 - 5478.56] P:1718.69 E:0.099909 |  Just a sign of sight of limbs with arms, scarves, hats,
[5478.56 - 5481.28] P:1686.55 E:0.103835 |  jumpers, everything being swirled around the heads
[5481.28 - 5483.56] P:1657.13 E:0.094700 |  in that end towards the right-hand side.
[5483.56 - 5485.92] P:1704.22 E:0.073451 |  They never did make that change, did they?
[5485.92 - 5488.56] P:1754.09 E:0.095389 |  Oh, no, Dries Mertens did come on in the end.
[5489.04 - 5492.72] P:1770.86 E:0.100046 |  So Mertens is on the Belgian international.
[5492.72 - 5495.36] P:1766.50 E:0.098295 |  I don't think they actually brought on Victor Nelson,
[5495.36 - 5499.04] P:1751.25 E:0.107835 |  though, the defender, as the ball is played forward,
[5499.04 - 5500.48] P:1895.53 E:0.112230 |  interception by Bouet.
[5500.48 - 5504.04] P:1858.25 E:0.101051 |  I think chances of nicking this one do Galatasaray.
[5504.04 - 5507.24] P:1919.88 E:0.105558 |  Bouet now with the cross and the queuing up for it.
[5507.24 - 5511.40] P:1810.98 E:0.108106 |  And in the end, the header from Iqadi just looked up
[5511.40 - 5512.92] P:1838.92 E:0.109768 |  and was saved easily by Onana.
[5512.92 - 5515.48] P:1860.32 E:0.097684 |  Yeah, every single chance in the last five, ten minutes
[5515.48 - 5518.36] P:1793.63 E:0.082386 |  for Galatasaray has come from this right-hand side.
[5518.36 - 5519.68] P:1821.70 E:0.095078 |  Down Manchester United's left,
[5519.68 - 5522.68] P:1817.63 E:0.095405 |  Amrabat just getting caught out of shape in the midfielder.
[5522.68 - 5524.96] P:1702.17 E:0.087406 |  What's concerned about that at the start of the game?
[5524.96 - 5527.80] P:1712.03 E:0.103254 |  Galatasaray have really honed in on that in this second half.
[5529.32 - 5532.12] P:1785.32 E:0.112285 |  So remember, Copenhagen won by and won.
[5532.12 - 5535.00] P:1925.14 E:0.103868 |  Manchester United drawing 2-2 here, Arsenal behind.
[5535.00 - 5537.00] P:1932.46 E:0.096991 |  Sevilla still leading PSV.
[5537.00 - 5540.96] P:1870.45 E:0.101939 |  Charlton 4-X at a one is the latest score in League One,
[5540.96 - 5543.36] P:1828.15 E:0.104999 |  in League Two, Tramir Robes are back in front at home
[5543.36 - 5545.52] P:1749.62 E:0.104253 |  to Bradford City by two goals to one.
[5545.52 - 5548.12] P:1758.06 E:0.112140 |  Crew lead Jillingham by two goals to nil.
[5548.20 - 5553.92] P:1699.69 E:0.103695 |  We have about 18 minutes remaining of normal time here
[5553.92 - 5556.72] P:1867.20 E:0.107221 |  at Old Trafford, Turkish Voices you can hear.
[5557.84 - 5565.12] P:1909.61 E:0.104781 |  And it was Zaha, the player who went off for Dries Mertens,
[5565.12 - 5568.32] P:1787.98 E:0.090846 |  so the former Crystal Palace man who got the first goal,
[5568.32 - 5571.56] P:1792.69 E:0.093460 |  the first equaliser for Galatasaray, 2-2.
[5573.72 - 5577.72] P:1808.51 E:0.093952 |  Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandez have actually just swapped roles.
[5577.72 - 5580.48] P:1750.05 E:0.097687 |  So Bruno Fernandez has come into the centre of midfield
[5580.48 - 5584.32] P:1865.56 E:0.092172 |  and Mason Mount's out on the right and he's actually just won a free kick
[5584.32 - 5586.04] P:1865.51 E:0.111065 |  after a foot race with Angelino.
[5586.04 - 5587.76] P:1983.62 E:0.103188 |  Really good opportunity for Man United.
[5587.76 - 5590.16] P:1943.36 E:0.107145 |  It is, it's a free kick, it's right-hand side.
[5590.16 - 5593.60] P:1964.37 E:0.110813 |  Just a little bit further on than the level of the penalty area.
[5593.60 - 5597.36] P:1981.76 E:0.100492 |  Fernandez to take it, fires it in, headed out, comes to Garnaccio,
[5597.36 - 5599.84] P:1926.63 E:0.103283 |  controls the ball, then looks to go on the outside,
[5599.84 - 5602.20] P:1868.15 E:0.106351 |  left foot, he will work it in low.
[5602.20 - 5605.60] P:1920.44 E:0.113569 |  And they were looking there for Oil and it was a devilish ball in,
[5605.60 - 5608.84] P:1937.13 E:0.109291 |  but it was some good defending and in the end it was Ikari
[5608.84 - 5612.28] P:1893.18 E:0.094935 |  who was back there of all people with the vital challenge.
[5612.28 - 5614.76] P:1819.55 E:0.087026 |  Yeah, it was a brilliant ball across from Garnaccio,
[5614.76 - 5617.48] P:1811.79 E:0.097468 |  off the second phase of the wide free kick,
[5617.48 - 5618.84] P:1769.45 E:0.099314 |  over on the far right-hand side.
[5618.84 - 5622.04] P:1932.80 E:0.092093 |  Garnaccio has received the ball, chopped onto his left
[5622.04 - 5625.72] P:1962.88 E:0.093088 |  and he's fist the ball right across the six-yard line.
[5626.96 - 5631.08] P:2014.58 E:0.105108 |  So Ericsson to take the corner kick in front of the tunnel area
[5631.08 - 5634.04] P:1986.24 E:0.093530 |  at the Stretford end, here at Old Trafford.
[5634.08 - 5638.64] P:2052.27 E:0.097290 |  He waits, left armour loft, right foot in,
[5638.64 - 5641.16] P:2006.47 E:0.106788 |  deep towards the far post, headed back goalwards
[5641.16 - 5644.36] P:1873.61 E:0.099992 |  and it's dropping from Casamiro's header onto the roof of the net.
[5644.36 - 5646.64] P:1818.61 E:0.095872 |  Maslera had it covered, that'll be a goal kick.
[5646.64 - 5648.32] P:1797.17 E:0.088699 |  Quarter of an hour remains, is he?
[5648.32 - 5652.04] P:1638.79 E:0.079696 |  Yes, much better delivery from Christian Ericsson.
[5652.04 - 5654.28] P:1653.11 E:0.098098 |  The first half, Bruno Fernandez was taking the corners
[5654.28 - 5655.88] P:1808.78 E:0.096482 |  and they weren't really beating the first man,
[5655.88 - 5658.72] P:1859.94 E:0.103669 |  although they were playing short and not ended up with an end product,
[5658.72 - 5660.04] P:1895.54 E:0.095397 |  but that ball in from Ericsson,
[5660.04 - 5662.16] P:1924.38 E:0.096923 |  fizzes it right across to the back to Casamiro
[5662.16 - 5665.44] P:1613.44 E:0.098957 |  and what I would say there is Casamiro, he's gone for goal,
[5665.44 - 5667.88] P:1712.68 E:0.093454 |  but can you head it back into the mix?
[5669.12 - 5672.00] P:1807.45 E:0.114437 |  Paul played down the line, on that far side the left,
[5672.00 - 5673.84] P:1808.29 E:0.115467 |  actor Hulu will win a...
[5673.84 - 5676.24] P:1903.24 E:0.104066 |  No, he won't win a corner, it'll be a goal kick.
[5676.24 - 5680.20] P:1842.89 E:0.098826 |  Incidentally, when Maslera was taking his time, the Slovakian referee,
[5680.20 - 5682.16] P:1827.26 E:0.100915 |  Ivan Krasliak was telling him to...
[5683.00 - 5684.72] P:1724.86 E:0.097095 |  No time wasting, hurry it up,
[5684.72 - 5686.60] P:1823.80 E:0.094222 |  as O'Nanna now waits to take the goal kick,
[5686.60 - 5689.00] P:1872.00 E:0.100310 |  Blackpool won, Derby three, Bristol rovers three,
[5689.00 - 5691.80] P:1887.67 E:0.101247 |  Port Bale 0, a two-lady scores in League One.
[5691.84 - 5692.84] P:1826.42 E:0.090266 |  O'Nanna gets it back.
[5692.84 - 5694.76] P:1870.99 E:0.119937 |  Oh, what a dreadful mistake by O'Nanna,
[5694.76 - 5696.84] P:1797.98 E:0.120367 |  he's presented the ball to Merton's penalty!
[5698.12 - 5699.48] P:1783.40 E:0.118484 |  Oh, my word!
[5699.48 - 5702.84] P:1842.27 E:0.109014 |  O'Nanna gave Casamiro no chance,
[5702.84 - 5705.32] P:1845.69 E:0.110113 |  it was a desperate lunge by Casamiro,
[5705.32 - 5708.96] P:1833.89 E:0.102086 |  that was dreadful from O'Nanna and Gallatassarite,
[5708.96 - 5710.80] P:1905.38 E:0.109443 |  and then to make matters worse,
[5710.80 - 5713.64] P:1893.93 E:0.112540 |  Casamiro is shown a second yellow card,
[5714.60 - 5716.48] P:1931.20 E:0.115052 |  because he was booked in the first half,
[5716.48 - 5719.04] P:1875.84 E:0.103143 |  Manchester United are down to ten men.
[5721.84 - 5726.60] P:1895.75 E:0.098883 |  A catalogue of errors, and Manchester United at 2-2,
[5726.60 - 5730.88] P:1894.79 E:0.097028 |  that was a shocking, shocking bit of play by O'Nanna.
[5730.88 - 5734.00] P:1662.90 E:0.074246 |  Oh, my word.
[5734.00 - 5735.52] P:1960.19 E:0.098285 |  What can I say about this?
[5736.36 - 5739.24] P:1803.11 E:0.098405 |  Playing out from the back, yeah, great, wonderful.
[5740.24 - 5742.92] P:1911.97 E:0.106981 |  But O'Nanna just does not see Merton's,
[5742.92 - 5744.76] P:1684.61 E:0.107407 |  who is in front of Casamiro,
[5744.76 - 5747.16] P:1899.90 E:0.091007 |  he passes the ball straight to him,
[5747.16 - 5749.56] P:1933.00 E:0.098270 |  and Merton's first touch takes him into the box,
[5749.56 - 5751.20] P:1988.31 E:0.099588 |  and he's been so clever,
[5751.24 - 5753.64] P:2017.69 E:0.098004 |  because he knows Casamiro has to slide,
[5753.64 - 5756.52] P:1949.87 E:0.103142 |  and he's just used the challenge, ridden the challenge,
[5756.52 - 5758.44] P:1914.13 E:0.093825 |  and just gone down and got a penalty.
[5758.44 - 5760.68] P:1892.82 E:0.106745 |  It looks like Icardi over the ball against O'Nanna,
[5760.68 - 5764.52] P:1801.48 E:0.089072 |  whose confidence must be right at the bottom right now.
[5764.52 - 5766.16] P:1863.73 E:0.108802 |  I bet they don't try the tap penalty,
[5766.16 - 5768.68] P:1927.36 E:0.104340 |  that they tried a few weeks ago, Gallatassarite,
[5768.68 - 5772.56] P:1855.64 E:0.100235 |  that caused Icardi to have an embarrassing miss.
[5773.64 - 5778.12] P:1867.64 E:0.101910 |  But now, Gallatassarite, with 13 minutes remaining,
[5778.16 - 5781.68] P:1929.92 E:0.106838 |  Mauer Icardi, who's had such a prolific start to the season,
[5782.76 - 5785.24] P:1945.94 E:0.109352 |  a chance maybe for O'Nanna to redeem himself
[5785.24 - 5789.48] P:1937.12 E:0.097424 |  after his error led to the penalty from Casamiro's challenge.
[5791.48 - 5795.52] P:1889.60 E:0.098950 |  Gallatassarite, who have never won in England,
[5795.52 - 5797.56] P:1954.23 E:0.093039 |  in the Champions League,
[5797.56 - 5801.56] P:1894.63 E:0.100456 |  with a chance to take the lead for the first time
[5801.56 - 5803.64] P:1947.30 E:0.100734 |  in this contest here at Old Trafford.
[5803.64 - 5807.08] P:1938.42 E:0.115156 |  Icardi runs up now, and he's missed it!
[5807.12 - 5808.84] P:1852.67 E:0.121494 |  He's missed it again!
[5808.84 - 5813.68] P:1875.44 E:0.116540 |  Icardi right footed, drags it wide to the left-hand post.
[5813.68 - 5816.84] P:1837.04 E:0.115372 |  He missed the tap penalty just a few weeks ago.
[5816.84 - 5820.16] P:1901.97 E:0.109632 |  He couldn't hit this first time out from 12 yards out,
[5820.16 - 5822.76] P:1800.40 E:0.105429 |  and it remains at 2-2.
[5822.76 - 5823.88] P:1724.14 E:0.100838 |  Wow!
[5823.88 - 5825.60] P:1898.43 E:0.095505 |  Tram!
[5825.60 - 5826.60] P:1937.59 E:0.104052 |  You know what?
[5826.60 - 5829.12] P:1913.74 E:0.097098 |  O'Nanna guesses the right way, and I actually think,
[5829.12 - 5832.64] P:1740.76 E:0.094946 |  if the ball is on target, I think he saves that.
[5832.64 - 5835.72] P:1743.84 E:0.093239 |  I don't want to say redemption, I think that's too kind.
[5835.72 - 5839.28] P:1778.72 E:0.104942 |  He's gone the right way, and I think he saves that if it's on target,
[5839.28 - 5841.80] P:1557.99 E:0.090122 |  but he's dragged it wide, poor penalty.
[5841.80 - 5844.80] P:1659.45 E:0.110461 |  Well, he had that embarrassing miss against Istanbul's bird.
[5844.80 - 5849.12] P:1750.78 E:0.109395 |  It was Atta Ulu, who just laid it off to the unrushing Icardi.
[5849.12 - 5851.44] P:1779.75 E:0.110543 |  He rolled it wide from 10 yards then.
[5851.44 - 5854.72] P:1856.67 E:0.099576 |  He couldn't hit the target from 12 yards on this occasion.
[5854.72 - 5857.24] P:1783.67 E:0.101689 |  And Manchester United, what a let-off!
[5857.24 - 5859.40] P:1849.24 E:0.089609 |  2-2, they're still down to 10 men.
[5859.40 - 5862.52] P:1683.58 E:0.092190 |  They are down to 10 men, they've lost one of their better players
[5862.52 - 5865.84] P:1644.85 E:0.088061 |  on the evening, Casamiro, two yellow cards,
[5865.84 - 5869.84] P:1749.37 E:0.081491 |  but look at O'Nanna now on the goal kick, going long.
[5869.84 - 5871.44] P:1633.35 E:0.080841 |  No risks.
[5871.44 - 5875.68] P:1711.92 E:0.099974 |  Well, what a dramatic night here at the end of Champions League.
[5875.68 - 5878.60] P:1849.16 E:0.104042 |  Manchester United can certainly count themselves fortunate.
[5878.60 - 5882.44] P:1637.77 E:0.083075 |  2-2, but the ball is pub long.
[5884.32 - 5886.64] P:1887.39 E:0.103874 |  Atta Ulu goes after it.
[5886.64 - 5888.20] P:1749.56 E:0.111300 |  Darlo, they will get there first.
[5888.20 - 5892.32] P:1696.80 E:0.078320 |  It will be a throw to Manchester United.
[5893.32 - 5898.24] P:1754.29 E:0.096885 |  And it means that Casamiro will miss the matchday three game
[5898.24 - 5899.68] P:1768.31 E:0.105629 |  against Copenhagen.
[5899.68 - 5902.36] P:1822.30 E:0.110669 |  Here is Mason Mount, trying to take it on himself.
[5902.36 - 5904.36] P:1883.01 E:0.089354 |  Sanchez clears the ball away.
[5905.36 - 5907.36] P:1846.77 E:0.091166 |  Ericsson to Garnaccio.
[5907.36 - 5909.84] P:1866.70 E:0.101605 |  Garnaccio stumbling, still going Garnaccio.
[5909.84 - 5912.60] P:1867.08 E:0.111850 |  Wrigling clear, what a challenge that came in.
[5912.60 - 5914.04] P:1902.00 E:0.108019 |  That was Bodeccio.
[5914.04 - 5916.84] P:1933.47 E:0.112334 |  How many times has he been on the end for Galatasaray,
[5916.84 - 5918.60] P:1985.95 E:0.109400 |  just throwing himself at it?
[5918.60 - 5920.80] P:1950.50 E:0.115647 |  Because Garnaccio, an amazing run,
[5920.80 - 5923.24] P:1925.13 E:0.102796 |  looked like he was going to get a goal for United.
[5923.24 - 5926.24] P:1963.04 E:0.097504 |  Yeah, you can see that, but Duccio is celebrating that like a goal.
[5926.24 - 5928.72] P:1960.18 E:0.095134 |  He's been an absolute wall tonight.
[5928.72 - 5931.52] P:1922.45 E:0.084934 |  It is an excellent play from Garnaccio, coming in from the left.
[5931.52 - 5933.12] P:1896.46 E:0.068660 |  Should have scored.
[5933.12 - 5936.48] P:1939.95 E:0.092494 |  2-2, Fernandez rolls the corner short,
[5936.48 - 5941.80] P:1887.22 E:0.097056 |  backs it to Fernandez, fires it in, and Iqari hooks it out behind for another corner.
[5941.80 - 5943.68] P:1907.91 E:0.086415 |  I'll tell you, I've just seen that replay.
[5943.68 - 5945.76] P:1782.59 E:0.092901 |  Garnaccio did everything he could.
[5945.76 - 5947.76] P:1890.14 E:0.098870 |  I was being a bit harsh, and he should have scored.
[5947.76 - 5948.76] P:1720.61 E:0.070106 |  The block was impeccable.
[5948.88 - 5951.56] P:1895.71 E:0.115499 |  Karlal had gone an injury time equaliser at home to Peterborough,
[5951.56 - 5954.56] P:1808.40 E:0.089147 |  one one at Brunton Park, that's in League One.
[5954.56 - 5957.68] P:1955.76 E:0.111249 |  Corner kick to Manchester United, here in the Champions League Live on 5-Live,
[5957.68 - 5962.00] P:1791.08 E:0.086515 |  Brunner Fernandez hits it in towards the near post, Iqari's header out.
[5962.00 - 5967.24] P:1828.69 E:0.092612 |  It's Garnaccio, who's forced to turn, and the pressure passes the ball back towards Onana.
[5967.24 - 5970.76] P:1839.03 E:0.099607 |  There'll be a few anxious moments here with Iqari just in front of him,
[5970.76 - 5973.32] P:1787.71 E:0.092323 |  but he clears it long out towards Garnaccio.
[5973.32 - 5975.40] P:1915.01 E:0.089846 |  Nice control on this near side, the left.
[5975.40 - 5977.52] P:1965.54 E:0.110845 |  5-Live, BBC sounds, radio Manchester,
[5977.52 - 5979.12] P:1834.93 E:0.094277 |  with just over 10 minutes remaining.
[5979.12 - 5981.28] P:1851.94 E:0.093274 |  2-2, Amrabat hits it forward,
[5981.28 - 5984.80] P:1835.34 E:0.111571 |  commanding header away by Davison Sanchez, and it reaches Iqari.
[5984.80 - 5988.28] P:1883.64 E:0.114967 |  Iqari's in here for Galatasaray, and he scoops it, goal was,
[5988.28 - 5990.56] P:1776.96 E:0.110405 |  and he finds the back of it out this time.
[5990.56 - 5994.04] P:1755.41 E:0.120049 |  He redeems himself after missing the earlier penalty,
[5994.04 - 5998.04] P:1859.41 E:0.109994 |  and Galatasaray for the first time in this Champions League game,
[5998.04 - 6000.40] P:1823.18 E:0.105510 |  lead on the night at Old Trafford,
[6000.40 - 6002.68] P:1842.93 E:0.107677 |  as they threaten their first win in England,
[6002.68 - 6005.76] P:1897.98 E:0.109099 |  Manchester United 2, Galatasaray 3.
[6005.80 - 6008.20] P:1888.52 E:0.084335 |  This is just incredible.
[6008.20 - 6009.80] P:1894.64 E:0.112101 |  I cannot believe what we are seeing.
[6009.80 - 6012.56] P:1826.44 E:0.096968 |  I think it's Amrabat that's keeping him onside,
[6012.56 - 6015.28] P:1884.95 E:0.102950 |  but he is left completely unmarked.
[6015.28 - 6018.32] P:1795.40 E:0.104330 |  Manchester United centre-backs for Ran and Lindelof, sorry,
[6018.32 - 6021.04] P:1884.81 E:0.106812 |  have no idea where Iqari is.
[6021.04 - 6024.00] P:1806.43 E:0.106341 |  He's behind them, I think it's Amrabat that's keeping him onside.
[6024.00 - 6026.84] P:1858.64 E:0.104777 |  And the ball's just gone back over the top, and the finish.
[6026.84 - 6030.04] P:1740.44 E:0.102225 |  I tell you what, you said about redemption, Dano.
[6030.04 - 6032.92] P:1761.82 E:0.098400 |  Yeah, it's Amrabat that doesn't get up, he's way onside.
[6032.96 - 6036.32] P:1667.71 E:0.107358 |  The ball's gone back, and he's dinked it over in honour.
[6036.32 - 6040.36] P:1727.29 E:0.112785 |  Well, I think that's the first time I've seen people chanting
[6040.36 - 6042.52] P:1877.21 E:0.104960 |  in the directors' box here at Old Trafford,
[6042.52 - 6045.24] P:1852.58 E:0.103582 |  but they're celebrating away towards our left.
[6045.24 - 6048.48] P:1868.23 E:0.105215 |  There were journalists of Galatasaray jumping up as well,
[6048.48 - 6050.16] P:1786.66 E:0.097880 |  away towards our right,
[6050.16 - 6054.56] P:1841.13 E:0.103527 |  and there are wild scenes in the Galatasaray away end.
[6054.56 - 6057.12] P:1763.98 E:0.096610 |  Because they've never won in England,
[6057.12 - 6059.88] P:1879.84 E:0.108562 |  drawn 3, lost 7, draws at Liverpool,
[6059.92 - 6062.32] P:1869.43 E:0.093147 |  Leeds United and Manchester United.
[6062.32 - 6064.48] P:1882.90 E:0.114976 |  The defeat here would actually equal a club record
[6064.48 - 6067.96] P:1817.26 E:0.106540 |  of three successive defeats in Europe for Manchester United,
[6067.96 - 6070.24] P:1906.11 E:0.096510 |  who now are going to be playing serious catch-up
[6070.24 - 6073.32] P:1905.49 E:0.080205 |  in this Champions League group if they're not careful.
[6073.32 - 6078.20] P:1899.64 E:0.088692 |  A successive defeat, trailing 3-2 to the Turkish champions
[6078.20 - 6081.16] P:1895.96 E:0.088478 |  who are maintaining their excellent start to the season.
[6081.16 - 6085.76] P:1882.63 E:0.089980 |  They've only had one defeat in their last 25 games in all competitions.
[6085.76 - 6087.72] P:1828.07 E:0.107950 |  Now we're going to see Nelson coming on,
[6087.72 - 6089.76] P:1794.66 E:0.101379 |  and Dumballe is going to be coming on as well.
[6089.80 - 6092.88] P:1898.21 E:0.081922 |  He's on loan from Tottenham, so a double change.
[6093.88 - 6096.00] P:1840.33 E:0.099703 |  And we're also going to be seeing Anthony,
[6096.00 - 6098.28] P:1926.44 E:0.095867 |  who's going to be coming on for Manchester United.
[6098.28 - 6102.44] P:1933.76 E:0.080865 |  He's missed the last five matches after that leave of absence.
[6102.44 - 6106.32] P:1889.71 E:0.094228 |  So Anthony as a substitute is going to be coming on for Manchester United
[6106.32 - 6108.60] P:1796.85 E:0.106433 |  because time is running out here at Old Trafford.
[6108.60 - 6112.36] P:1841.60 E:0.092870 |  You can only hear Turkish voices, five live,
[6112.36 - 6116.20] P:1877.64 E:0.090830 |  BBC sounds, Radio Manchester, nine minutes remain.
[6116.20 - 6117.48] P:1764.84 E:0.091399 |  Manchester United.
[6118.48 - 6120.52] P:1922.10 E:0.122774 |  And now we've got some more work here.
[6120.52 - 6124.04] P:1976.62 E:0.110232 |  This is Bué coming forward, Bué taking it on. Bué almost with a fourth.
[6124.04 - 6125.80] P:2012.35 E:0.107190 |  He didn't right-footed over the crossbar,
[6125.80 - 6128.16] P:1982.60 E:0.101327 |  came off the legs of Dallow who made the challenge.
[6128.16 - 6129.68] P:1901.14 E:0.097993 |  Corner kick to Galatasaray.
[6129.68 - 6133.08] P:1928.84 E:0.085892 |  They just seem to have two or three more players on the pitch right now.
[6133.08 - 6135.80] P:1874.40 E:0.085596 |  Galatasaray is Bué, the fullback.
[6137.00 - 6139.52] P:2017.20 E:0.102557 |  He was just charging through the middle of Manchester United
[6139.52 - 6141.28] P:1688.16 E:0.067975 |  like they are not there.
[6141.28 - 6143.32] P:2029.13 E:0.103784 |  And he's gone for the finish. He could have actually squared it,
[6143.32 - 6144.88] P:1901.98 E:0.063638 |  but he's gone for the finish.
[6144.88 - 6146.80] P:1920.81 E:0.099397 |  And it was Dallow that just got a nick on it,
[6146.80 - 6148.92] P:1881.49 E:0.097101 |  it's taken over the bar, over an honour,
[6148.92 - 6151.48] P:1935.06 E:0.077919 |  but I tell you what, Manchester United,
[6151.48 - 6153.56] P:1905.03 E:0.104840 |  where is the leadership in this team right now?
[6154.88 - 6157.00] P:1895.14 E:0.106777 |  Bayern Munich have come from behind in Denmark,
[6157.00 - 6159.80] P:1705.75 E:0.088589 |  Copenhagen won, Bayern Munich two.
[6159.80 - 6162.68] P:1852.13 E:0.099966 |  Change is being made, Angelinho is coming off.
[6164.36 - 6167.84] P:1803.53 E:0.106521 |  And Don Belé has come on to replace the former Manchester City man.
[6169.64 - 6170.64] P:1776.71 E:0.101308 |  So...
[6172.32 - 6174.08] P:1813.80 E:0.109573 |  The French international coming on.
[6174.88 - 6178.68] P:1782.34 E:0.093496 |  And then I think the other player who's going to be going off is Kahn, Ihan.
[6178.68 - 6181.04] P:1878.17 E:0.095007 |  And that is why Victor Nelson comes on.
[6181.04 - 6183.36] P:1844.02 E:0.098849 |  So they'll probably go three at the back for Victor Nelson,
[6183.36 - 6185.24] P:1978.65 E:0.091656 |  the Danish defender to come on.
[6185.24 - 6187.96] P:1867.45 E:0.093323 |  That's the change he's being made by Galatasaray.
[6187.96 - 6189.92] P:1930.16 E:0.105308 |  Oliveira with the corner kick right-hand side.
[6189.92 - 6192.60] P:1936.78 E:0.090607 |  It's an out swinger, it's headed back goalwards and it drops wide.
[6192.60 - 6195.60] P:1913.19 E:0.087383 |  And it goes out for a goal kick.
[6195.60 - 6199.84] P:1935.00 E:0.085916 |  But Manchester United two, Galatasaray three.
[6199.84 - 6203.40] P:1853.12 E:0.092041 |  After twice, Manchester United had taken the lead.
[6203.44 - 6208.36] P:1925.02 E:0.103006 |  And it's going to be Mason Mount who's coming off for Anthony to come on.
[6208.36 - 6211.40] P:1893.76 E:0.110472 |  Full-time at Portman Road, Aaron Paul.
[6211.40 - 6214.56] P:1976.46 E:0.116604 |  Ipswich three, Hal Nill, goals from Burns, Chaplin and Harnes,
[6214.56 - 6217.24] P:1937.30 E:0.092021 |  and Ipswich Town, top of the championship tonight.
[6217.24 - 6218.92] P:1935.12 E:0.075455 |  Ipswich three, Hal Nill.
[6218.92 - 6221.44] P:2099.97 E:0.099625 |  I'll give you all the results in a few moments' time.
[6221.44 - 6223.96] P:1861.54 E:0.096684 |  PSV have equalised in Eindhoven.
[6223.96 - 6225.72] P:1816.54 E:0.099846 |  PSV, Eindhoven won, Sevilla won.
[6225.72 - 6227.00] P:1911.43 E:0.081838 |  That's in Arsenal's group.
[6227.00 - 6232.64] P:1856.86 E:0.091528 |  Remember Arsenal are still behind to Lons by two goals to one in Group B.
[6233.52 - 6237.96] P:1737.04 E:0.086238 |  But here, Galatasaray against the ten men of Manchester United.
[6237.96 - 6241.32] P:1823.89 E:0.093701 |  Lead by three goals to two.
[6241.32 - 6246.84] P:1808.91 E:0.095133 |  They haven't won away in 17 matches in the group stages.
[6246.84 - 6251.64] P:1829.44 E:0.094772 |  Since 10 years ago, when they beat Schalke, 3-2 in the last 16.
[6251.64 - 6254.76] P:1878.67 E:0.093611 |  Since then, they've lost 14, they've drawn three.
[6254.76 - 6258.52] P:1788.21 E:0.087791 |  As Hoylund wants Galatasaray to take the free kick quickly.
[6258.52 - 6262.80] P:1792.24 E:0.099802 |  And Galatasaray will do so with Sanchez who's given the hurry up from the referee.
[6262.84 - 6264.52] P:1733.71 E:0.104632 |  What a dramatic second half, is he?
[6264.52 - 6267.40] P:1791.30 E:0.089979 |  I can't quite catch my breath at what's going on in the pitch.
[6269.40 - 6276.32] P:1800.88 E:0.086039 |  Just been enthralling the ball turning over the transitions.
[6276.32 - 6277.96] P:1889.37 E:0.091291 |  Galatasaray just hungry.
[6279.80 - 6282.28] P:1803.80 E:0.106925 |  It was a lovely finish, a scoop finish from Mikardi.
[6282.28 - 6286.16] P:1851.90 E:0.085339 |  11 goals now he's scored in 13 games this season.
[6286.16 - 6289.48] P:1825.10 E:0.103758 |  They're all about his quality from his time in Italy.
[6289.48 - 6292.40] P:1865.15 E:0.090619 |  Twice he was top scorer in Serie A.
[6293.80 - 6296.68] P:1802.20 E:0.104104 |  As Galatasaray now, the ball chip forward,
[6296.68 - 6301.12] P:1857.30 E:0.093123 |  curled round the corner by Oliveira to Bouet inside.
[6301.12 - 6302.88] P:1841.57 E:0.072558 |  Yilmaz lets it run.
[6302.88 - 6306.00] P:1844.62 E:0.090698 |  The lay-off back towards Oliveira has a go.
[6306.00 - 6309.40] P:1828.15 E:0.103342 |  Dig a goal from 25 yards out, right forward in, always on the rise.
[6309.40 - 6312.96] P:1815.89 E:0.102472 |  Goal kick, Galatasaray there with four minutes remaining, 3-2.
[6312.96 - 6315.80] P:1772.90 E:0.096697 |  It's not rocket science what Galatasaray have done in this game.
[6315.80 - 6320.24] P:1856.03 E:0.084999 |  What they've done is they've targeted Amrabat at left back from Manchester United.
[6320.32 - 6323.08] P:1916.41 E:0.097367 |  Not his familiar position, but in this second half in particular,
[6323.08 - 6326.68] P:1778.36 E:0.076329 |  the amount of times that they have got down this left-hand side,
[6326.68 - 6329.52] P:1819.23 E:0.092872 |  far too easily, and that is where the goals have come from.
[6329.52 - 6332.68] P:1994.46 E:0.102692 |  The results from the championship, Birmingham City first win in six.

[6394.48 - 6398.00] P:1981.71 E:0.093185 |  After we've heard what Arsenal are doing with Alistair Bruce-Bourgh.
[6398.00 - 6400.96] P:1826.71 E:0.115737 |  Well, they're trying to find an equaliser away to Long's here.

[6412.44 - 6413.80] P:1883.56 E:0.103886 |  Michel Arteta has run the changes,
[6413.80 - 6416.44] P:1782.46 E:0.101036 |  yet really though to create a clear cut chance
[6416.44 - 6417.64] P:1683.46 E:0.088176 |  to get themselves back in it.
[6417.64 - 6418.76] P:1855.62 E:0.095251 |  Long's to Arsenal one.
[6418.76 - 6421.80] P:1910.15 E:0.101923 |  Manchester United are still behind here to Galatasaray,
[6421.80 - 6423.64] P:1729.53 E:0.091861 |  all in white defending the strep for Dan,
[6423.64 - 6426.92] P:1779.31 E:0.089008 |  but with against the 10 man after Kassimiro sending off.
[6426.92 - 6428.48] P:1829.08 E:0.111333 |  They're seeing a lot more of the ball.
[6428.48 - 6429.72] P:1916.85 E:0.101590 |  They're going to make a substitution.
[6429.72 - 6431.32] P:1905.86 E:0.093468 |  Marcial's going to be coming on.
[6431.32 - 6434.44] P:1920.90 E:0.105316 |  It means, as promised, I can give you the full-time results in League Two.
[6434.48 - 6435.96] P:1847.98 E:0.101868 |  Crew Two, Jillingham Nill.

[6459.60 - 6461.28] P:1968.38 E:0.090541 |  Sutton Nill, Salford Two.
[6461.28 - 6463.44] P:1794.02 E:0.100470 |  Sutton still haven't won since the opening day.
[6463.44 - 6466.80] P:1921.23 E:0.111241 |  Tramir beat Bradford City 2-1 and it finished Walsall Nill.
[6466.80 - 6467.96] P:1951.38 E:0.109780 |  MK Don's Nill.
[6467.96 - 6469.96] P:1847.15 E:0.104234 |  Amrabat is the player who comes off.
[6469.96 - 6474.36] P:1893.35 E:0.100105 |  Marcial comes on and Eric Tenhag has three minutes plus stoppage time.
[6474.36 - 6478.48] P:1795.86 E:0.092482 |  Is he to try and salvage something from this game here at Old Trafford?
[6478.48 - 6480.16] P:1908.46 E:0.085499 |  Yeah, and Amrabat's just come off,
[6480.16 - 6485.12] P:1832.59 E:0.085258 |  trying to kind of identify the signal that Tenhag's just given the two centre-backs.
[6486.32 - 6488.88] P:1814.92 E:0.106754 |  I'll figure out and let you know how many United are going to look,
[6488.88 - 6490.92] P:1861.80 E:0.106174 |  but what we do know is that I need to get a goal.
[6490.92 - 6493.40] P:1866.66 E:0.087802 |  They've just got a free kick on the edge of the box.
[6494.16 - 6494.96] P:1862.11 E:0.094967 |  Could help.
[6494.96 - 6499.44] P:1862.72 E:0.097726 |  That was a foul. Sergio Oliveira against his fellow Portuguese international.
[6500.08 - 6503.76] P:1905.37 E:0.091667 |  And so Manchester United now, right of centre.
[6504.84 - 6507.04] P:1981.50 E:0.101615 |  Just under 25 yards out from goal.
[6507.04 - 6510.72] P:2046.47 E:0.096454 |  Down to ten men, inside the last 60 seconds of normal time,
[6510.72 - 6512.40] P:1916.36 E:0.098919 |  here in the rain at Old Trafford.
[6512.40 - 6514.56] P:2090.80 E:0.095940 |  Trelling by three goals for two.
[6514.56 - 6516.24] P:2051.30 E:0.092491 |  Bruno Fernandez.
[6516.24 - 6518.12] P:2064.16 E:0.122788 |  Izzy Wehr says, where is the leadership?
[6518.12 - 6521.80] P:2001.16 E:0.091835 |  They need the captain now to step up here with this free kick.
[6521.80 - 6525.44] P:1969.73 E:0.104997 |  But there is a wall of what?
[6525.44 - 6527.96] P:2079.40 E:0.100081 |  Six from White shirts for Galatasaray.
[6529.00 - 6531.08] P:1992.89 E:0.105558 |  Well... Five in the wall indeed,
[6531.08 - 6533.80] P:1949.80 E:0.090759 |  but they're going to have two red shirts on the end of it.
[6533.80 - 6536.44] P:2030.87 E:0.110213 |  I don't mind being proven wrong, but it ain't an angle for a right foot.
[6536.44 - 6538.12] P:1996.07 E:0.085891 |  I'll tell you that, Dono.
[6538.12 - 6539.12] P:2037.13 E:0.091500 |  So...
[6542.20 - 6543.20] P:1957.51 E:0.111884 |  It is.
[6543.20 - 6546.68] P:1891.38 E:0.113296 |  Bruno Fernandez with a free kick into the wall, it goes.
[6546.68 - 6548.84] P:1946.80 E:0.100940 |  And we're into seven minutes of added-on time.
[6548.84 - 6551.56] P:1910.41 E:0.093858 |  Seven minutes, a minimum of seven minutes now here.
[6551.56 - 6552.72] P:1775.38 E:0.097024 |  On five, live.
[6554.16 - 6555.84] P:1917.39 E:0.100005 |  From the throw, Manchester United.
[6555.84 - 6557.08] P:1780.90 E:0.060718 |  Fernandez.
[6557.08 - 6558.28] P:1799.59 E:0.075170 |  Back it goes.
[6558.28 - 6559.12] P:1863.52 E:0.101058 |  Ball works in.
[6559.12 - 6561.72] P:1838.62 E:0.092131 |  Ericsson's touch, broken up by Galatasaray.
[6562.60 - 6564.76] P:1813.45 E:0.105169 |  Achtung Uluk clears it away, downfield.
[6564.76 - 6567.20] P:1986.09 E:0.094064 |  Varan will see it back towards Onana.
[6568.64 - 6571.68] P:1835.86 E:0.090366 |  And then if he had brittle confidence before tonight,
[6571.68 - 6574.64] P:1876.36 E:0.082290 |  Onana after his display tonight,
[6574.64 - 6577.00] P:1942.78 E:0.095706 |  that certainly won't have improved a great deal
[6577.00 - 6580.24] P:1926.90 E:0.083928 |  as the ball is played forward by Varan.
[6580.28 - 6582.52] P:2010.59 E:0.100794 |  Out towards that side, towards Anthony.
[6582.52 - 6585.68] P:1998.16 E:0.087960 |  Dispossessed and loses the ball on that far side.
[6585.68 - 6587.28] P:1788.19 E:0.069634 |  Galatasaray.
[6587.28 - 6589.60] P:1851.23 E:0.101938 |  Ball played now by Mertens to Yilmaz.
[6589.60 - 6592.20] P:1904.61 E:0.084596 |  He's made a difference since coming on, Yilmaz.
[6592.20 - 6595.08] P:2007.48 E:0.108912 |  Bué always a threat on this right-hand side, coming forward.
[6595.08 - 6597.12] P:1837.65 E:0.100688 |  Now looks towards Akali.
[6597.12 - 6598.12] P:1854.44 E:0.111292 |  What an effort that was.
[6598.12 - 6599.40] P:1988.52 E:0.100582 |  Hit it on the half-volley.
[6599.40 - 6601.84] P:1998.87 E:0.100979 |  It was a sweet strike too, right footed just wide.
[6601.84 - 6602.92] P:1923.06 E:0.104086 |  They almost had a fourth.
[6602.92 - 6606.32] P:1876.95 E:0.082090 |  Yeah, it was Bué again running down this right-hand side.
[6606.32 - 6608.04] P:1866.45 E:0.099725 |  Ghanacho not tracking him.
[6608.04 - 6610.00] P:1580.16 E:0.085809 |  We did, but he didn't keep up with him.
[6610.00 - 6612.96] P:1691.22 E:0.080783 |  And it was just the run from Mikardi.
[6612.96 - 6614.76] P:1688.60 E:0.103760 |  And the half-volley, connected with it really well.
[6614.76 - 6619.16] P:1777.11 E:0.093765 |  He's quite unlucky, but far too easy again from Manchester United.
[6619.16 - 6620.72] P:1588.89 E:0.087648 |  I know they're down to ten.
[6621.72 - 6625.24] P:1790.32 E:0.105003 |  You can see why Bué's attracted the interest of Brighton Arsenal, can't you?
[6625.24 - 6627.44] P:1675.98 E:0.093996 |  I was just thinking the exact thing.
[6627.44 - 6629.76] P:1355.70 E:0.094413 |  Then I've been really impressed.
[6629.76 - 6631.88] P:1802.88 E:0.094514 |  He's grown into the game, especially this second half.
[6631.88 - 6634.08] P:1751.38 E:0.089383 |  I don't know if that's because he's played in front of us.
[6634.08 - 6635.64] P:1825.99 E:0.108897 |  But I've been really impressed with him.
[6635.64 - 6638.28] P:1791.77 E:0.109077 |  Just beaten in the air on that occasion by Lindelof.
[6638.28 - 6642.20] P:1931.85 E:0.086555 |  But the substitute, the Victor Nelson, the Danish defender,
[6642.20 - 6644.92] P:1905.73 E:0.091906 |  came across to put the ball out of play for a throw.
[6644.92 - 6648.84] P:1928.32 E:0.101074 |  So on this near side, Lindelof not quite level with the penalty air on the left.
[6648.84 - 6650.92] P:2054.36 E:0.084388 |  He takes it, Marchelle with a little touch.
[6650.92 - 6652.92] P:1851.05 E:0.103056 |  Ericsson was under pressure from Dries Mertens,
[6652.92 - 6655.44] P:1878.40 E:0.102725 |  and it goes, he was a hurried ball forward as a result of that.
[6655.44 - 6657.76] P:1814.78 E:0.087641 |  Now to play it goes for a throw to Galatasaray.
[6657.76 - 6658.76] P:1923.29 E:0.100488 |  You want to know something?
[6658.76 - 6661.00] P:1864.73 E:0.087693 |  I don't think Manchester United help each other at all.
[6661.00 - 6664.12] P:1754.12 E:0.080715 |  I think the basics throw in small passes, sets.
[6665.04 - 6667.84] P:1680.07 E:0.104399 |  From what I've seen tonight and what I've seen this season,
[6667.88 - 6669.24] P:1804.56 E:0.111620 |  they just don't help each other out.
[6669.24 - 6671.84] P:1699.95 E:0.103633 |  They put bounces on throw-ins so that when you control in the ball,
[6671.84 - 6673.36] P:1840.66 E:0.084905 |  you're a little bit unorthodox.
[6673.36 - 6675.80] P:1766.72 E:0.090164 |  And I've seen a few of them tonight, and I just think, like,
[6675.80 - 6677.24] P:1737.82 E:0.085837 |  I'll show you back to basics.
[6677.24 - 6679.48] P:1459.48 E:0.092415 |  Gotta do the simple things well.
[6679.48 - 6681.60] P:1659.65 E:0.111853 |  Well, he said in his programme notes, Eric Ten Haag,
[6681.60 - 6684.60] P:1863.24 E:0.088633 |  with no attempt to hide behind the excuses,
[6684.60 - 6686.84] P:1725.06 E:0.077950 |  not being good enough.
[6686.84 - 6690.44] P:1804.51 E:0.095660 |  And certainly the mistakes that they've made tonight
[6690.44 - 6693.12] P:1846.31 E:0.087387 |  have proven costly.
[6693.12 - 6695.60] P:1867.60 E:0.091727 |  As Onanna hits the ball long,
[6695.60 - 6698.72] P:1866.60 E:0.099541 |  Bué could climb again from the right back in the aerial duel.
[6698.72 - 6700.44] P:1840.16 E:0.102891 |  Not beat them this occasion by Lindelof,
[6700.44 - 6703.28] P:1898.15 E:0.099123 |  and now they try to release Hielmars.
[6703.28 - 6706.88] P:1893.90 E:0.102831 |  His head bobbing, beaten to the ball, though, by Ericsson.
[6706.88 - 6708.52] P:1870.67 E:0.103764 |  They were appealing for a free kick.
[6708.52 - 6711.28] P:1933.00 E:0.096270 |  We're into the third minute of the seven to be added on.
[6711.28 - 6714.40] P:1893.80 E:0.088251 |  The 10-minute Manchester United hit long by Ericsson.
[6714.40 - 6717.72] P:1878.07 E:0.091389 |  Bué there and will clear it away for Galatasaray.
[6717.72 - 6720.80] P:1842.18 E:0.088189 |  Marciel against Indombele.
[6720.80 - 6722.64] P:1818.60 E:0.100748 |  Ericsson beaten by the bounce of the ball,
[6722.64 - 6723.76] P:1883.66 E:0.097693 |  gets a right foot onto it,
[6723.76 - 6726.00] P:1851.05 E:0.088567 |  a little bit scrappy there in the midfield.
[6726.00 - 6728.88] P:1864.70 E:0.099616 |  On the half folly, Ericsson turn, lifts it downfield.
[6728.88 - 6731.32] P:1855.09 E:0.082237 |  Bué there, will get there before Garnaccio.
[6731.32 - 6732.60] P:2012.64 E:0.103330 |  And behind it goes...
[6732.60 - 6733.96] P:1827.95 E:0.099588 |  No, it doesn't go out of play on this occasion,
[6733.96 - 6736.40] P:1866.21 E:0.091459 |  kept him played by Lindelof.
[6736.40 - 6739.56] P:1927.49 E:0.111340 |  Remember, Arsenal are still behind despite taking the lead.
[6739.56 - 6741.92] P:2084.01 E:0.105285 |  Lowns two, Arsenal won.
[6741.92 - 6744.36] P:1987.62 E:0.103666 |  As Onanna goes long downfield.
[6744.36 - 6745.80] P:1937.58 E:0.093358 |  Nelson with a header away.
[6745.80 - 6748.76] P:1900.90 E:0.095837 |  Only as far as his fellow Dane, Ericsson hits it early.
[6748.76 - 6751.00] P:1878.38 E:0.095704 |  Garnaccio, 30 yards out from goal.
[6751.00 - 6751.88] P:1937.62 E:0.087811 |  Lindelof.
[6751.92 - 6754.88] P:1945.01 E:0.105090 |  Lindelof's bemoaning the lack of options.
[6754.88 - 6757.08] P:2122.66 E:0.113763 |  Looking for that creativity, Manchester United.
[6757.08 - 6758.60] P:1911.43 E:0.112668 |  Poor ball.
[6758.60 - 6760.68] P:1905.21 E:0.112280 |  Getting bogged down now with a weighted pressure,
[6760.68 - 6762.36] P:1739.55 E:0.111028 |  it would seem, for Bruno Fernandez.
[6762.36 - 6765.80] P:1917.75 E:0.102582 |  Manchester United, they just can't break free of the shackles here,
[6765.80 - 6769.92] P:1945.66 E:0.085513 |  as their concerning start to the season continues.
[6769.92 - 6773.76] P:1976.80 E:0.090174 |  Verran not helped by, of course, the fact that they're down to 10 men.
[6773.76 - 6778.12] P:1853.80 E:0.086828 |  As Sanchez, climbs over the top of Hoiland with a header.
[6778.12 - 6780.72] P:1817.50 E:0.084501 |  An extra good loop on that far side now, has it,
[6780.72 - 6785.00] P:1748.11 E:0.105837 |  and Dumballet rolls away from Bruno Fernandez and runs forward.
[6785.00 - 6785.92] P:1790.62 E:0.076413 |  2-1.
[6785.92 - 6788.32] P:1863.09 E:0.089904 |  It is, and Dumballet, a little bit of a stumble.
[6788.32 - 6791.48] P:1843.27 E:0.106965 |  And then the ball was a loose one from Mertens.
[6791.48 - 6794.24] P:1880.22 E:0.102458 |  Now to Bruno Fernandez, to Garnaccio.
[6794.24 - 6795.76] P:1977.89 E:0.110799 |  But it's three against five.
[6795.76 - 6797.80] P:1963.08 E:0.091585 |  Garnaccio on the left-hand side.
[6797.80 - 6800.40] P:2046.80 E:0.103052 |  Three minutes about it on time remain, on five-live.
[6800.40 - 6801.40] P:1981.09 E:0.095811 |  Here is Hoiland.
[6801.40 - 6803.36] P:1904.16 E:0.109288 |  Hoiland with a back heel, gives them all away.
[6803.36 - 6805.96] P:1879.57 E:0.092126 |  It goes straight through to the goalkeeper, Mouslera.
[6805.96 - 6808.16] P:1818.19 E:0.106122 |  That's probably the only foot that Hoiland's put wrong tonight.
[6808.16 - 6809.28] P:1797.55 E:0.077386 |  Is that back heel?
[6809.32 - 6812.96] P:1840.72 E:0.085018 |  He thinks that he can back heel it back into the path of Garnaccio.
[6812.96 - 6817.20] P:1635.31 E:0.083620 |  He had the idea of a 1-2 in his head, but Garnaccio didn't.
[6817.20 - 6819.96] P:1754.73 E:0.092618 |  But I'll tell you what, in the midst of this Manchester United performance,
[6819.96 - 6823.08] P:1671.87 E:0.080254 |  if they do find a equaliser,
[6823.08 - 6825.36] P:1775.28 E:0.092326 |  Hoiland has been absolutely fantastic.
[6827.28 - 6829.92] P:1772.26 E:0.107106 |  It's going to be a famous win for Galatasaray.
[6829.92 - 6832.56] P:1840.32 E:0.104657 |  The Turkish champions, Ericsson, slides it forward.
[6832.56 - 6834.40] P:1919.59 E:0.099770 |  Marciel enters the penalty area.
[6834.40 - 6836.76] P:1910.50 E:0.106609 |  Marciel! What a save by Mouslera!
[6836.76 - 6838.96] P:1954.60 E:0.087078 |  Flags up on the far side.
[6838.96 - 6840.92] P:1857.21 E:0.120595 |  Mouslera punches the air with delight,
[6840.92 - 6844.28] P:1936.22 E:0.097721 |  because Marciel's made the run inside left channel of the penalty area.
[6844.28 - 6846.28] P:1945.24 E:0.107724 |  He's opened it up onto his right foot, it's curling,
[6846.28 - 6848.88] P:1830.59 E:0.096960 |  and it's clawed away by the right arm of Mouslera.
[6851.56 - 6853.88] P:1885.52 E:0.102129 |  Hoiland must have been the one in the offside position.
[6854.76 - 6856.56] P:1865.24 E:0.105446 |  Yeah, it must have been Hoiland on the second phase,
[6856.56 - 6861.08] P:1854.43 E:0.087679 |  but it's the first time we've actually seen Mentioned Marciel since he came on.
[6861.08 - 6863.68] P:1907.19 E:0.085266 |  Yeah, it's Marciel who's the one who's offside, just off.
[6863.68 - 6866.48] P:1803.32 E:0.092230 |  But the ball from Ericsson through, Marciel cutting in.
[6866.48 - 6869.56] P:1776.55 E:0.098144 |  He's actually deflected, and you think it's going right into that far corner.
[6869.56 - 6870.56] P:1751.95 E:0.078373 |  It's a good save.
[6872.04 - 6877.08] P:1824.54 E:0.088414 |  Manchester United will be pointless at the bottom of Group A.
[6877.08 - 6879.96] P:1879.37 E:0.093197 |  They will be four points behind Galatasaray.
[6879.96 - 6882.88] P:1939.08 E:0.099544 |  They will be six points behind Bayamunik,
[6882.88 - 6886.28] P:1785.06 E:0.073261 |  who come here on the final group game.
[6886.28 - 6890.52] P:1830.17 E:0.089579 |  The pressure on Ericsson on the hard side then to try and get something from it.
[6890.52 - 6895.56] P:1854.26 E:0.090080 |  Those back-to-back games against Copenhagen are going to have to try and kickstart
[6895.64 - 6900.88] P:1932.95 E:0.096011 |  the Flagging Champions League campaign for only the third time in Manchester United's
[6900.88 - 6902.48] P:1830.24 E:0.103267 |  history in this competition.
[6902.48 - 6904.76] P:1935.17 E:0.097609 |  Will they be winless after two games?
[6905.96 - 6909.64] P:1774.75 E:0.097115 |  11-12 campaign and 98-99.
[6909.64 - 6911.96] P:1864.60 E:0.101431 |  Here, of course, that they won it.
[6913.36 - 6918.20] P:1905.44 E:0.109484 |  But with time desperately running out, we enter the last 60 seconds of injury time.
[6919.00 - 6920.84] P:1992.03 E:0.101755 |  Oh, Nanner has come up from the back.
[6920.84 - 6924.68] P:2032.90 E:0.104383 |  Manchester United down to 10 men, trailed by three goals to two.
[6925.80 - 6927.88] P:2040.06 E:0.099963 |  Ericsson waits to take the free kick.
[6927.88 - 6930.36] P:1973.28 E:0.093273 |  That 10 yards in from the left touch line.
[6930.36 - 6934.56] P:1942.76 E:0.099403 |  Right-footed on the diagonal, aimed towards Ohnana, over the head of the goalkeeper.
[6934.56 - 6936.56] P:1926.75 E:0.102427 |  Headed in, headed away by Sanchez.
[6936.56 - 6940.24] P:1864.78 E:0.098198 |  Hasn't really been beaten much in the air tonight, the former Tottenham man.
[6940.24 - 6942.56] P:1936.60 E:0.102345 |  And all of a sudden, Ohnana is out of his goal.
[6942.56 - 6944.84] P:1934.10 E:0.099394 |  And Galatasaray play the ball forward.
[6944.84 - 6948.60] P:1932.23 E:0.102614 |  Atta Erglu, held up by Fernandez as Ohnana retreated.
[6948.60 - 6950.28] P:2006.69 E:0.113556 |  Early ball forward.
[6950.28 - 6953.68] P:1998.27 E:0.110395 |  The ball from Fernandez finds Dallow, unmarked right-hand side.
[6953.68 - 6955.16] P:1951.41 E:0.093797 |  15 seconds remain.
[6955.16 - 6958.56] P:1879.85 E:0.107452 |  Dallow right corner of the area, tries to get away from his man.
[6958.56 - 6960.92] P:1901.18 E:0.099831 |  There it was again, Badaksha.
[6960.92 - 6965.40] P:1930.06 E:0.103041 |  How many times has he been there right-place, right-time for Galatasaray tonight?
[6965.40 - 6968.84] P:1870.30 E:0.100533 |  And it will be a free kick to Galatasaray, and that might well be up.
[6968.84 - 6971.88] P:1768.44 E:0.088813 |  And the camera lenses are trained on Ericsson Hark.
[6971.88 - 6973.08] P:1906.12 E:0.067301 |  Yeah, it's bad actually.
[6973.08 - 6975.12] P:1836.52 E:0.098685 |  It's been absolutely exceptional this evening.
[6975.12 - 6979.40] P:1820.37 E:0.105201 |  I'll tell you what, though, that tackle from Bruno Fernandez.
[6979.40 - 6980.64] P:1845.43 E:0.099981 |  Sorry, over to you, Deno.
[6980.64 - 6982.04] P:1882.09 E:0.122300 |  There is the final whistle.
[6983.04 - 6986.52] P:1936.48 E:0.111876 |  Manchester United's miserable start continues,
[6986.52 - 6989.28] P:1933.88 E:0.102724 |  and their mistakes have proved so costly,
[6989.28 - 6992.76] P:1911.44 E:0.101461 |  as Galatasaray earned a famous win in Old Trafford.
[6992.76 - 6997.12] P:1889.68 E:0.101365 |  The first time in 11 attempts that they've won on English soil.
[6997.12 - 7000.00] P:1803.35 E:0.106111 |  No wonder their supporters celebrate wildly.
[7000.00 - 7003.28] P:1850.43 E:0.106231 |  Manchester United feeding the game with 10 men, two.
[7003.28 - 7005.04] P:1854.30 E:0.089630 |  Galatasaray, three.
[7005.04 - 7007.04] P:1432.50 E:0.075708 |  Is he?
[7007.04 - 7009.40] P:1738.11 E:0.104748 |  Well, the scene's in front of us right now.
[7009.52 - 7012.20] P:1778.43 E:0.085980 |  The Galatasaray bench and all of their staff
[7012.20 - 7013.32] P:1728.28 E:0.102537 |  that must work at the club.
[7013.32 - 7016.16] P:1618.19 E:0.094760 |  There's hundreds of them over in Turkey,
[7016.16 - 7019.08] P:1621.80 E:0.101345 |  but you can see their fans as well, what it means to them.
[7019.08 - 7023.32] P:1663.48 E:0.096604 |  I mean, to come here, Manchester United are like a wounded animal at the moment.
[7023.32 - 7025.08] P:1716.62 E:0.105139 |  And my word, they have taken advantage.
[7025.08 - 7030.36] P:1628.09 E:0.095146 |  Yes, they were gifted a chance back into the game by Anana from that era.
[7030.36 - 7034.36] P:1695.11 E:0.097598 |  But Manchester United, again, were talking about a performance
[7034.36 - 7038.40] P:1743.74 E:0.092445 |  which had elements of quality, but not enough control.
[7038.40 - 7040.84] P:1705.05 E:0.105913 |  And at 1-0, when they went 1-0 up with Thruhojland,
[7040.84 - 7044.40] P:1785.94 E:0.087769 |  you just start to wonder at what stage are we going to start seeing
[7044.40 - 7048.00] P:1700.08 E:0.096553 |  a Manchester United team control the game after taking the lead
[7048.00 - 7050.88] P:1750.74 E:0.092026 |  and taking advantage of that, pushing for a second goal.
[7050.88 - 7053.48] P:1829.24 E:0.105961 |  Reaction to come, but it's finished here at Old Trafford.
[7053.48 - 7055.20] P:1811.05 E:0.093582 |  Manchester United, two.
[7055.20 - 7056.68] P:1769.18 E:0.096350 |  Galatasaray, three.
[7056.68 - 7057.68] P:1628.90 E:0.069391 |  Kelly.
[7057.68 - 7060.08] P:1653.68 E:0.055731 |  Ian Dennis, Izzy Christensen, Old Trafford, four.
