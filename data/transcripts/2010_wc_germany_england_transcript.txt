 Well thank you Mark only three European teams can make the last eight Spain or Portugal Holland or Slovakia England or Germany so close to call it really is 50-50 whoever turns up on the day will go through the England team is unchanged for the first time under Fabio Capello the line-up is David James Glen Johnson Matthew Upson John Terry and Ashley Cole James Milner Frank Lampard Gareth Barry and the captain Stephen Gerard Wayne Rooney will he finally arrive at this World Cup and Jermaine Defoe Germany one change closer after suspension winning his 99th cap today 49 international goals comes in for the Brazilian born cacao who's injured anyway and the Brazilian team that's right the German team is Neuer Lam the captain Friedrich Mertesaker and Boateng who's recovered from injury and plays at left back the man who's joining Manchester City then the two midfield players holding midfield players Kedira who's Balak's deputy and Schweinsteiger past fit to play and then on the right Thomas Muller in the middle the danger man really he's only 21 but he's such an important player now in this German side the player from Vetta Bremen Erzil then Podolski the enigma playing on the left-hand side and the man I mentioned closer or gay Larry Onda from Uruguay is the referee England and red Germany in white England it looks like will play from right to left it's been very warm today but the temperature will cool down during this game final thought from Chris Waddle I think they're too well much say it's play basically the same system and it's basically if you win individual battle you're probably going to win the game well everything that's gone before is history England must focus only on this German team and this challenge and hope especially that Fabio Cappello's household names will do themselves justice that's really all anybody can ask it is a pity it's not the final in many ways but we're in the last 16 playing for a place in the quarterfinal there's the usual delay here before we can get underway Wayne really looks impatient standing over the ball with Jermaine Defoe England will begin this game still and this doesn't help of course the players to settle down here I remember Terry Butcher always says whenever we go to big matches in the past he always says make sure your first touch is good and that's particularly what Fabio Cappello and Baldini down there Franka Baldini will be looking from these England players to settle down straight away looking for big performances in particular today from Lampard from Gerard and from Rooney here we go there Germany against England for a place in the quarterfinal of the World Cup England play the ball back into their own half and everybody's immediately trying to get a good first touch on the ball John Terry playing on the right of Matthew Upton it goes into midfield now and Barry who launches it for the first time looking for Defoe neither of these two central defences are particularly quick on the turn England will want to try and test the Germans early on Germany clear it's still inside their half Germany yet to really get hold of the ball it's Ashley Cole now down this near side the left that's going to be some battle between Cole and Lam to the very best fullbacks in the world and England have a throw in just short of a half way left well Germany have dropped off they're not pressing they've started the tournament pressing teams obviously they respect England and they've dropped off and I think they're gonna look for counter attack and play really his first touch you look to be bundled over but the referee plays on and now Germany get their first meaningful touches until Ashley Cole closes down Erzel and they really cannot afford to give him any space at all throwing to Germany looking for closer for the first time closer the shuffles it down the right hand side to Muller and in comes Ashley Cole with another good challenge against the big Bayern Munich player playing on the right hand side another Muller for England to cope with another Bayern Munich Muller as well throw to England you're listening to us at five live maybe you're listening to us at Glastonbury in the sunshine as England now build once more from the edge of their own penalty area and it's John Terry on to Glenn Johnson over on the far side. Milner now gets his first touch wide on the England right works it in field to Defoe little flick from Defoe doesn't work and Germany now move it into the England half Erzel does doesn't control it and Gerard now finds Rooney whose control is poor and it's back on the half way line but Gerard reacts quickly and finds Ashley Cole Gerard again near side the England he'll have to play in a really disciplined way here today Gerard England can't allow Lawn to go forward with Muller it's Stephen Gerard once more just biting his time back inside the England half blaze it into feet now not controlled first time by Milner but now lamp after Defoe who doesn't hold on to it England need better touches than that nervous start perhaps from both sides as Germany bustle forward and it's an excellent touch now from Erzel faced by Matthew Upson Upson trying to take him wide over on the far side but Dalsky trying to step in anyone to give this back to David James eventually Gareth Barry happy for it to go out for a goal kick and I started okay I know there's a few first touches not you know you want it's very early in the game Erzel's had a three aims and lost it three times it's gonna take a while for these teams to settle down you've got to say England have a lot more experience than this German side David James now in the England goal of course following the error made by Robert Green players for England game settling down here then in Blomfonte and that's gone straight back into the England half once more and the ball just runs away it might actually be a throw in this by the corner flag not a goal kick so England under a little bit more pressure because Glenn Johnson has to make sure that he gets this throw accurately forward settling down in the last 16 of the World Cup England with Milner over on the far side Milner of course who played against the German under 21s in the final in Sweden last year many of those German players have graduated into the senior team including Erzel now throwing to Germany nobody's picked up Mully yet in the penalty area in goes the throw in towards Mulla John Terry heads it out England flick it towards Wayne Rooney who's a little isolated better first touch from Rooney but he's closed down by Kedira Rooney heads it forward German defenders are back it's Murdersacker giving goalkeeper Neuer his first touch relatively inexperienced Neuer in the German goal Fabio Capello already out pointing England looking to build and a break up away Rooney no the flag is off given for offside eventually over on the far side Germany pushing up Rooney can't believe the decision flag was quite late and it's a German free kick I think he's blue for the initial ball coming forward not for long playing it forward I think he's actually flagged when the ball came forward from Upsons header nothing people thought it was their larmel played it so he did but he'd already flagged now Schveinsteiger looking for a run from Erzl danger here for England Erzl shot saved by James's legs and the ball goes away for a corner kick nobody really tracking Erzl there and on the break David James saving England with his feet and it's a corner to Germany far side good place by Erzl put a good ball by Schveinsteiger and he just England a great fortune it was on his right foot not his favorite left so we see Boateng the full back going into the England penalty area he's standing right on the goal line Germany then with this first corner kick of the game here over on the far side the left Germany nil England nil now Boateng backs away and James holds it beautifully good catch confidently held there by James reassuring and then a big high clearance downfield but it should be Friedrichs ball not a very good first touch for him though it almost ran to Rooney on the halfway line Boateng got in ahead of Rooney and now Schveinsteiger who's such a smooth passer of the ball try to find Muller England struggling to get this one away at the moment now it's out of play and Schveinsteiger starting to step up a gear here in the match Schveinsteiger's throw to Kedira who won't venture very far forward at all Boateng had to hit that one quickly and it's an offside against Erzl and England have a free kick and we played just over five minutes of the first half nil nil here in Blumfonte it's very front to get them in at no where you can really put the foot on it a lot of challenges going in and you get here so the only chance of the game James like the way that he confidently handled that one though just a few moments ago all in yellow away to our right fantastic support here once more for the England team but also the Germans getting fantastic support away to our left that's a poor ball from James downfield and Fabio Cotellan won't be happy with that because remember him getting Joe Hart a hard time recently when he wasn't able to be more constructive with his distribution he's now actually looking across at the England bench as well James almost as if to say well what can I do there because nobody was really offering Germany bill now from inside their own half with the captain love such a consistent performer rarely misses a German game ball swept into the England half Glenn Johnson's there but Terry takes responsibility the ball's on the halfway line Barry now trying to turn with Kedira that's a ball out of play though from Barry lacking the control it's towards Fabio Cotellan and Germany just starting to settle down here have a throw in nobody settled yet Mike they're still obviously looking for it to get the foot on it string four or five passes a minute live up there I took the red there but England no Russian everything instead of just putting the foot on the ball out three or four passes Schweinsteiger nice change of pace there plays the ball on to Miller Schweinsteiger always making himself available little trick there to get away from Defoe starting to pull the string Schweinsteiger finding down this near side Ersel bit of German possession now Lawn infield nicely played to Kedira back again to Lawn Lawn's venturing forward for the first time Ashley Cole hasn't got it away and the ball breaks to Ersel down the right hand side Ersel now up against Ashley Cole the ball now possibly may get swept in from Lawn and Ersel's beating the offside trap Ersel's ball in but it's waiting for it is Upson and England clear but now Rooney on the break for England Rooney taking the ball towards the half wayline Schweinsteiger approaches him Rooney has to give it back to Glenn Johnson Johnson now in field to Barry Barry crosses the half wayline Milner's available Milner up against Boateng Milner turning with Boateng but I think Boateng is going to be too quick for him here by the corner flag and does well to avoid putting the ball out of play Germany keeping possession neatly and then Boateng hits a high ball back to the half wayline where Terry takes it on the chest John Terry of England on to Lampard who's struggling to make early impact here Upson of England nil nil here in Blumfonte Geroz just gone into the centre for the moment Geroz turns and then hits a high one to the far side and that won't find Milner the intention was right couldn't quite get the accuracy though and it's the throw to Germany left hand side. Geroz actually his movement's been excellent he's wanting to get involved he's wanting the ball he's just over here a couple of passes there's no rhythm to the game no pattern yet. Grant Taylor's with us we'll hear from him shortly when we played about 10 minutes it's nil nil as this game continues just to settle down and now Rooney trying to judge the bouncing ball against Friedrich Friedrich's header away still with England though and that Johnson's overplayed it and that's going to be a goal kick to Neuer nil nil and really neither side has an initiative yet Chris. No there's a lot of nerves obviously there's a lot of hate about this game isn't there always is and then nobody settled down yet there's part I'm gonna see the chance from here so where it was on his right foot rather than his left far from that nothing happening. So the German clearance into the England half Muller of course is tall down the right hand side he heads the ball on Terry has to be watchful here against closer ball back in the England area out comes David James quickly but they will always be a handful Germany when they get forward with closer one short of 50 international goals Muller the youngster down the right hand side and of course the threat of Podolski on the left the Enigma Podolski ball into the German half headed away by Friedrich and now Ursul again finding too much space for me in midfield Ursul's ball onto Podolski but well read by John Terry England must get tighter on Ursul now Frank Lampard with a good ball to Steven Gerard in the centre circle Gerard trying to pick a pass here for Defoe out though will come Neuer Defoe can't reach that and let's get some thoughts now from Graham Taylor Graham. Well the game is still not yet settled down but Mike you've taken the words out of my mouth the one thing I'm concerned about is Ursul you know nobody I'm not saying he should be man marked but he wonders about that he's been in and David James had to make the save I'm just a bit concerned about the freedom that he's actually getting well he must have figured high in the discussions on the game as now Milner gets the ball for England Ursul they always have problems England picking up these players who play just behind the strikers and now England a little congested in midfield that needs some wits here Barry plays it down the centre Milner turns into trouble and here comes the break now with Ursul once more and Podolski it's Podolski for Germany left players left and right Podolski tries a shot brilliant block though from England and from John Terry and now they look to clear on the edge of the penalty area. Well there's a classic in Ursul and Podolski double help and out the midfield but the ball spills out and everybody had gone forward and really Podolski should have rolled Ursul back in. Listen to five live ten minutes gone in the game between England and Germany in the last 16 of the World Cup here in South Africa in Blumfontaine and right in the heart of South Africa it's Nildale and now Rooney finding Barry and going for the return ball. Rooney immediately two or three German players around him waste it hits it straight at the full back boating Germany don't build again and England now have an opportunity with Ashley Cole down below us on this near side the left. Pretty cagey opening as you would have expected really and it's Gareth Barry now. England looking for accuracy with their passing. England fans we can hear now particularly the fans behind David Jones's goal. It's Frank Lampard now hasn't ventured very far forward so far. England do need to get tighter though on Ursul as now it's Defoe for England. Defoe wriggles the ball to the far side of the field and Johnson halfway inside Germany's half. Johnson now down the line to Milner. Germany appealed for offside not given Milner now swings it in with his left foot looking for Defoe. Powerful header away by Murdersaker. Barry's trying to close down this time on Ursul but Schweinsteiger mopping up once more now knocks it to this near side and it's headed down neatly by Muller to his Bayern Munich teammate the captain Larm. Larm against Gerard good ball in field to Schweinsteiger this seem to be finding room here and that's another good ball onto Ursul and England really not getting tight enough on him. They turn the ball to the far side the field and the tall Boateng. Boateng now for Podolski who swingered across from left to right it's a fantastic ball. Muller though doesn't control it and Ashley Cole goes in really well left for England. Muller's tumbled over with an alleged injury and Frank Lampard spittingly puts the ball out of play and Germany will have to give the ball back now from this right. It was a fair challenge it was a very hard challenge though Muller just bad first touch which we've seen a lot. He's caught slightly on the ankle but he's got up now and Germany will throw the ball back to England. Stephen Gerrard's just getting a word or two there from Stuart Pierce who played of course with Chris against the German side the last time these two teams met in the World Cup itself in the tournament of course the last time the side's met in a World Cup game a qualifying game was the famous 5-1 in Munich for England Michael Owen and all. Now it's Upson for England in this unchanged lineup 12 minutes gone in the first half five live Upson decides to give the ball back now to James in the England goal. England yet to create anything here. We've had an opening for Ursel for Germany saved by David James. Barry England trying to pass and move here. Barry held up by Ursel plays it square to Lampard. England looking for some momentum here Lampard inside the centre circle Gerrard taps the ball back to Barry now it's Ashley Cole just below us on the left hand side back again to Barry Barry comes inside Muller Barry now for Stephen Gerrard wide on the left so many German players working back it may may break here for Ashley Cole now it's a good interception from Philipp Lam ball spins back towards the German penalty area and it's going to be a goal kick now to Neuer a little bit better there from England. Well that gives them a little bit of confidence that was what seven eight maybe nine passes and Ashley Cole first time he's ventured forward but unfortunate with a challenge off Larm but you know they've just got to keep the ball it's just growing confidence what is you say they haven't created anything they haven't put anything in the box yet. Larm so far no real breakaways from him down the right hand side and Friedrich who's really a fullback but he's now playing alongside Mertzacker in the way that Metzeld used long-worn now from Boateng Upsons let it sail over his head Ashley Cole will have to follow this one towards the dead ball line closest there runs into the corner flag and it's going to be an England throw by the corner flag closer reluctant to give the ball back a little petulantly there to Ashley Cole. Throw into England with nearly 15 minutes gone in the first half Germany nil England nil here in Blumfonte. England throwing to be taken by Ashley Cole taking his time making sure he gets it right Cole's throwing doesn't fly as Paul throw in really Gerard scoops the ball to the half wayline Defoe gets a strong challenge from Friedrich Defoe yet to really settle into the game as now Kedira plays the ball back in Germany regroup on the half wayline it's Schweinsteiger if in doubt give it to him Muller now going inside this time finding Larm down the German right high ball in it should be David James's and it is it's a beautiful catch once more and James throws out well that's better distribution Lampard now Rooney and Defoe ahead of him players trying to join Lampard in midfield Rooney takes it on the edge of the center circle there's nobody down the left hand side for him to give it to instead he gives it to Gerard and now Gerard sweeps it to the far side Johnson and Milner are there Defoe's waiting in the area Johnson holds and then gives it to Miller crossing opportunity here for England it's Johnson again it's taking a long time now the cross goes in and it's a poor one really and the ball just bounces up easily for Neuer in the German goal hesitating about putting a ball in the box and had three in there didn't it same three three redfield you're the goal again Muller here comes the danger now from Thomas Muller once more down the right hand side England trying to track back it's played into closer back again to Muller Mullers played a wasteful ball though and although the Germans keep possession they lose a bit of their momentum for Dalski on to Schweinsteiger time for all the England players now to come back behind the ball the Schweinsteiger finds Larm's done that so many times in his career Ursula again hugging the right touch line back again to Larm and in the field to Schweinsteiger Germany nil England nil and the well cop here in Blumfonte now it's Kedira Germany looking to try and spring the traffic Kedira shot is really poor into the England fans David James watches it sail wide and high and it's going to be a goal kick you've got to say though I think when Germany go forward that their movements a lot better than England's at the moment you know Muller's running in say then Ursula comes out way there's a lot of interchanges in play and there's not a lot of pressure on the ball in the cricket later scored old truck at England are 28 for one with 42 overs left meeting 213 to win the match and the series against Australia here Germany nil England nil in the World Cup England yet to really threaten anything at Noia's goal cautious start from England the only alarm really I suppose the freedom occasionally that Ursul's getting and now England look to Rooney Rooney reaches the ball does well to keep it in and now here's Rooney's chance to attack the German defenders he's up against Murdersacka Rooney now not a good ball at all headed away by boating the left back of Germany and then a foul given against Johnson on Padovsky he's one of the England players by the way Johnson threatened with suspension Milner and Gerard being the other players on the yellow cards Muller's just getting a drink but also some words from his manager down there as Germany now crossed the half-way line playing from left to right Schweinsteiger foot on the ball surrounded by red England shirts and he's given it away and now England find Defoe looking for a change of pace here to vote Defoe for England all on his own the lampard takes over it maybe running into trouble here lampard goes down he's looking for a free kick and he's won it but generous that I think 17 and a half minutes gone but a chance for England that's a good opportunity I should have a tune you are 25 yards middle of the goal just slightly to the right but yeah yeah front lampard gets challenge goes down in the referee blows a lot of legs in that tackle it's an opportunity of a lampard he had to strike the ball well there was nothing on there for England lampard wasn't going anywhere the Germans really didn't need to do that but here's England's first opportunity to make Neuer in the German goldmaker save at the moment he's standing by his left post now Frank Lampard aware what these balls can do here these Jabalani balls can Frank Lampard strike England in front here in the last 16 of the World Cup he's 25 yards away from Neuer's goal it's pretty central and here comes a Chelsea man lampard goes straight into the German wall opportunity wasted it's now back inside the center circle and Ashley Cole now does well for England Cole on to Defoe and to Rooney Rooney's giving it away poor play from Wayne Rooney and Germany now looking to counter attack 18 and a half minutes gone nil nil here in Blumfontein and that was a big moment for Frank Lampard and it really was weekly delivered the free kick and it's Ashley Cole again now down the England left into the center circle for Lampard England haven't got the width over on the right-hand side at the moment so Gerard steps in Lampard and Gerard exchange passes then the ball to the far side almost found its way through to Johnson it was well defended by Germany England now need to put a bit of pressure on this German defense and they have a throw in for Glenn Johnson to take wide on the right Gerard's gone across for the first time to the right across came in took a deflection I thought and it what it hasn't taken a deflection because it's a goal kick in on the court now James Miller Gerard sorry you've volleyed it across the goal and it was too much pace on for anybody but I mean you dominate position they're winning a lot of challenges in the middle of the park we're trying to push Jeremy back Jeremy are quite happy to get behind the ball and play on the counter attack just got to replay the free kick one of the German players very close to using his hand there to stop that free kick but away we go Germany nil England no Terry's out of position he's lost the ball Upson against closer closer going in oh to score for Germany there is one closer punishes John Terry and Matthew Upson right down the heart of England's defense and scores his 50th international goal and it's Germany one England no I've got to say you don't see many goals like that unless you watch them the morning pub football that is just a big punt down the middle of the field what are the two cent halves thinking about and where's David James when it comes over the top that is an unbelievable simple goal and you talk about a world cup it's just a big point from the goalkeeper the two cent are so not alive they're not working each other and not covering each other and give closer credit he didn't give up on it David James back pedals he's brave closer and he pushes it into the bottom corner they always say to his right foot terrible goal to give away what a wretched moment for England defensively all it was was a clearance downfield from the German goalkeeper Neuer Terry let it run on Upson was then confused by closer James didn't come and made it very simple really for a striker of Miroslav Klosos quality to give Germany the lead and now Schveinsteiger stolen the ball away from Frank Lampard and it's on to Ersel and there's danger here for England as John Terry tries to close down Ersel the Germans leading through closer closer can hardly get in the Bayern Munich team as the cross comes in once more and Muller's header should be saved by James he hasn't been able to be a regular starter for Bayern Munich but here for Germany on his 99th appearance he's now scored a half a century of goals only Gert Muller has managed that before I can't believe what I saw there mate I'm sorry you know England totally control the game really they've won a lot of challenges we'll be worried about the counter attack that wasn't a counter attack was a set-piece clearance which has got them in on one long ball it's pub football and of course that now will help this German team to settle down and England need to put more pressure on the defenders as Defoe tries to go forward but it's easily met by Friedrich in the air and now Germany clear through Lawn wasn't a great clearance but England need to get hold of this in midfield now they were caught out right down the centre Terry Upsen and then James and Kloser finished easily Lampard now looking for Rooney hasn't been cleared by Merdezakka but he doesn't need to anyway the ball's gone away for a goal kick to Germany they scored from a goal kick it's the halfway point of the first half England were just starting to settle down here now they need to climb two or three gears here because they're trailing 1-0 and here's Alan Green. Graham what did you make of that? Well as Mr Beckenbar says kicking rush football the goalkeeper kicked it long closer rushes after it ball at the end of the internet it was shocking defending you get there is no excuse for that the two centre-backs to a degree the keeper but the two centre-backs all over the place it's I mean Chris has just described it as football and I understand totally that's what you see on the Sunday on the Sunday Park sorry Graham I didn't drop the Germany were on the attack there actually I blame Terry initially and then I thought it was compounded ratchedly by James failing to advance here's Rooney we've had a stinker so far and that just shows what a stinker he's having because he just belts that high and into the crowd I can't remember him finding a colleague with a fast way in Rooney. No he struggled against today he struggled at last few games he just doesn't look himself he's to control his awareness everything about Wayne Rooney what you expect it's not happening this tournament so far and we need him in a game like this. Well we're just seeing a replay of David James reaction to the goal he should look at a mirror as well. Terry and James primarily at fault for that debacle England nil Germany won and England have had not a single effort on goal so far not that Germany be that much better Gerrard unlucky not to get the ball back off Kedira it clicks into the air Johnson with the prurer defensive header and here's Podolski to Urzel Urzel shooting from long range it hits the gold score closer and that's behind for a goal kick. By the way I'm just remembering what I saw this referee not not refereeing again but I saw him at Port Elizabeth Airport with these mates you know the two assistants of the fourth official and he was exceedingly noisy over a game of cards and couldn't give a stop who he was annoying. Anyway more annoyed with the goal nearly 25 minutes played England trail 1 nil here to Germany in Blumfonte Milner back to the errant Terry and left for Johnson and here's Lampard once more you know you talk about the key figures Lampard not involved in the game Rooney when he is involved giving the ball away here's Barry he's certainly properly involved in the match he finds Terry Terry away toward the far side England right nice chip pass to Johnson into Milner under hits it to Johnson somehow gets to the full back and now it's with Lampard back to Barry 35 yards from goal should left foot is straight at the goal people at least we're doing a bird to phone really chasing up a case it spun back to Mazzone. Well I think you know it's early in the game I know but you've got probably as the game goes on you probably got a look at Gerald going in the middle Svane Stegas running the game there's no doubt about that we need somebody look at the two cent halves again and you've got to look at say somebody getting closer and break enough Svane Stegas Lampard and Barry for all the hold in its aims they don't play forward ever if you look they don't play any forward boards it's very slow they're always going back here is Barry and Barry drifts it towards the foes an awful ball from Gareth Barry Kaderer flicks it towards Urzel and it's beyond him and it's behind for a goal kick England nil Germany won in Blumfontein this is five live in the BBC Lampard for England into Barry inside the center circle and Barry slips the pass to the left hand side to Ashley Cole Cole back to Barry England still sluggish in buildup not enough movement Upson to Terry on to Rooney Rooney has come deep Rooney slips away from Friedrich passes to the right to Johnson only to foes in the penalty and I joined by Milner of all people Johnson trying to take on Podolski in the far side of the field Podolski tackles and beats him and then hits it up field straight to John Terry Terry who finds Lampard lazy pass from Lampard not good enough here's fine Stegas over the half way line tackled by Lampard at least you've got to say I don't know Germany's got attacks right they're not pushing on this was playing a lot of space playing stay on to the other middle of the park are basically bossing the game close as all the threat the two center of stone I hope the crowd who's going to pick him up who's going to cover to me you've got a tactic spot on at the moment well the reason for my pre-match optimism was basically I felt that either Lampard or Rooney or hopefully both would start to shine when they haven't yet and we play 27 minutes to the first half Germany lead 1-0 James all in yellow clears it right footed high towards to foe unequal task because where does that go to them but the ball breaks to Barry on to Rooney Rooney almost lost it Barry to Lampard it's so congested there only Gerard providing with down the left side and it comes to Gerard who points to Ashley Cole says get forward and then Gerard moves inside now he plays it towards Milner whose first touch wasn't great but Milner still has the ball he ran into the Euro-Guan referee shouldn't have been anyone near that and England lose possession now to the goal scorer closer closer run today to play to throw into England I think he's quite fortunate teams are so doesn't really want to run with the ball a lot today because he's got so much space when he picks it up Cole back to Upson and now to Terry and Terry on to the far side to Johnson 28 minutes play England ill Germany one on five line Upson again we've still been played at a very slow tempo the match awful pass forward from option 60 yards straight behind goal kick shocking we don't we need snow if you're watching this if you're watching this game in it Spain Stegor especially Spain Stegor more and could he up he's running the get when he gets it he's always looking to play forward and looking a little balls one two we don't see that from over two centimetre few players they get it the look there's nothing there the thing is nothing there they go back and square it slows the game down too much goal kick taken by Germany it's headed out of play by Barry I wasn't able to say pre-match what I thought of the England selection I understand why we went with the same 11 personally if Kings fit you should play that's my view let's have one ball player in the centre of the fence at least here's Lam the captain for Germany hitting it crossfield behind boat a boat and controls it the left full back and now he chips it overheats it so we're not the only ones guilty of a misplacing passes that's through to James James to Upson 16 minutes left in the first half and not a lot is happening out there Germany won't care they got the 1-0 lead by the way they also won the Grand Prix Sebastian Betel Lewis Hamilton was second in Valencia here's Upson Upson thought about playing it upfield James is mine past sideways to Cole and now it's little lampard and lampart awful what do you ever see Frank lampard hit such an appalling pass for Chelsea he doesn't even think he doesn't play as deep though and that's another thing I feel a bit for the way because he's better with people behind them and let him go on it's up to that he gets in the box and scores goals this is not his strength when he plays and I don't think sitting in the midfield half an hour play now I and it ain't going England's way even if Germany aren't that good also that's a nice touch though at finding Muller Muller on independence could be 2-0 of James blocks plus his effort that atoned at least for his error at the goal I still want to be flicked there and want to board closer lifts it it's 2-0 he just a it's along the floor give James credit made himself big England are lucky not to be too behind he's running down the left side he's got to be murdered Zachary easily but only defo's inside the penalty area and it's played very deep looking for Milner it's out of play for a throw in that was a counterattack for England Germany committed a few bodies forward for a change and but it was lovely play by Germany lovely ball by more like close it was never offset if he lifts it it's 2-0 it's along the floor well I mean arguably Terry should have intercepted the pass the closer he didn't James Bulls again but actually it's lucky it's only one now now the ball chipped in to foes offside hit the crossbar doesn't matter don't get worked up he's offside yeah he's got two yards offside as well domain to fall start to open up a little bit for England who only got a good run down the left and 40 over here he's crossing to fall just offside it's a ball ahead of it's 72 years since Germany failed to reach the quarterfinals at least the quarterfinals of the World Cup you believe they were beaten by Switzerland 1938 and they're leading England 1-0 and heading at the moment for a quarterfinal game against either Argentina or Mexico but we still got the best part of an hour here and we might have extra time Upsett again picks it unnervingly upfield wastefully away from red shirts and into the possession of Germany by the way England the other England the cricket England 48 for one and now it's played forward for Muller Muller with Padovsky available into Padovsky Padovsky's lack of control but he should slow under James leg and it's 2-0 to Germany and it's directed defending again and England have a mountain decline you've got to say and in this defense the two centre backs and even a full box of times John Terry and Matthew Upsett when they've got a bit of movement and a bit of sharpness they've got no pace they can't turn and that's Matthew some strength after all pace but Muller just strolls he could have scored himself gives it to Padovsky who hits it in from a real a kick angle anybody runs from these two centre halves can't see them coming there's no pace John Terry struggling terrible pace Padovsky to great finish on a difficult angle but you've got to say Germany's deserved it I'm not speaking with hindsight I would have had King in the team I don't think Matthew Upsett is a particularly good central offender and John Terry's fault is to say the least erratic and the two of them together well it's one thing against Slovenia it's another thing painfully against Germany England will have to get a goal back before halftime or we can say good night to the South African World Cup of 2010 Graham can you bear to lift the microphone just about Alan it's I mean there's nothing you can say if you defend like that I don't care whether you're in a World Cup tournament or a Sunday League tournament you're gonna lose you're gonna concede goals the the the back four the two central defenders are all over the place and it's so easy to cut through them as we saw then good goal from Germany you could say that but so easily done by very very poor basic defending well the German fans are ecstatic as well they should be but let me give you a reverse situation let me think back to 1970 Leon England were 2-0 up remember what happened Germany won the game 3-2 here Germany lead 2-0 but England have to show an awful lot more than they've shown in the first 34 minutes he is actually cold on the left side and back it goes to Gerard Capella needs to get Gerard in the center of the action here Gerard that's a good ball forward to the foe the foes first touch not the best but he keeps possession on the miller on the far side of the field England have lamp pardoned really waiting for the cross and Gerardy bleeding was lamp first touch I think the flag got to the goalkeeper and cleared by Germany I've got to say that is where Frank lamp odd is what we expect in a Chelsea shirt what we've seen there get him in the box don't let him play deep he's not that tight with play up let him get forward and get in the box and he will get chances well he he did well there lamp pardon the goalkeeper nor did very well too it was a save by the goalkeeper 2-0 Germany on five line Rooney loses it again the way Wayne Rooney is playing he actually doesn't merit his place on the pitch not good enough here's Muller Muller under closer close into the penalty area Johnson's across there and Johnson clears I think off closer no the referee from Uruguay's give it a corner say what the movement I'd say the problem muller comes inside and close as movement and with the dogs getting there so England's back for just kind of cope with him as simple as that they're trying to pass people on and you can't pass them on unless somebody's willing to pick them up we spare they're all over the shop by the way that go for closer with his 50th for Germany and this is a flurry can't fit in the bar in Munich team corner to Germany third goal now good night on the far side of the field arms a lot from Schweinsteiger as he plays it in deep and it went a long way closest there in the six yard box and James finally makes his move blocks it is behind for another corner he can't believe closest on a drug button between Gerard and Upson and he nearly scores he had no right James kicks it away with his left foot diving at his feet but it's breathtakingly poor defensively from England in fact they've got to hang on at 2-0 the half-time corner taken by also into a James who plex it from the air and James at the point building it upfield because there's nobody there so he throws it right underarm to Barry in the far side back to Johnson Johnson chips into Barry no conviction there on it goes to lampar get it down Frank lampar to Miller on the far side Miller back towards lampart this is good from Frank lampart down the right side to four weeks for the cross and what happened that cross was blocked behind for a corner doing nothing in there now actually stinking two-wheel down got nothing to lose and now they're starting to relax lately never go corner taken sure Milner on his right foot back to Gerard Angles acute Gerard crosses in shot for Upton England have scored through Matthew Upton a goal back High badly needed was that England won Germany 2 well I thought we're gonna put the cross in a little bit earlier eventually it comes back to Gerard on the corner in your box on the right hand side it's a good delivery in Upton ghost in nobody picks him up I think it's bolt angle standing next to him watching the ball he gets above him in a goalkeeper as in no man's land it's a good head-up just hit the target and it goes into one remember Leon reverse remember Leon to one Germany lead but the goalkeeper was dreadful actually doing a bit of a net either so have a goal back and they have possession again Milner onto the phone if I was friends well exit the D break break for the goal line so much for the lack of technology we'll see in the replay anyway now Germany on the ball to those just outside the penalty England penalty shot is wide after that was a certain goal so do I certain goal and the liesman was 20 yards off so he didn't see it he was on the 18-yard lay I was a goal it was a good foot over the line well done FIFA you don't want technology what a travesty it's not even close it's not even close grandma gonna bring you in here well first of all the German defenders have caught the English disease because they're defending was shocking the goalkeeper coming out no chance at all that goal was so obviously over the line but the assistant referee was so far behind play he must have been 30 yards behind it but everybody you could see it was over the line what a game this is developing into let's hope that German Germany continue defending that manner and the England improve that's certainly an escape for Germany his lamp part playing it through towards the phone to full wide right Rudy's waiting in the penalty area defoes attempted cross blocked behind for a corner I just want to say coming the international board should hang their heads in chain technology exists so that we know when the ball crosses the line it's not good enough it's not a Russian lanes but anyway oh that's a different era I don't I don't really care about that not even was to England's benefit that was a different era that was a playing goal England on the attack after a quarter Gerard crosses very deep too deep behind for gold king is offside anyway this time the lanes was going to fly up since England went to know down they've actually just relaxed and actually had a go at them they've got nothing to lose to know down and got themselves a goal back and I think Germany need the half-term was the level main England well we see that the Germans are no great shakes dependably as well well who's that is that close over see the treatment at the moment I think to his left knee set flatters here I hope he's proud of himself to one Germany lead balls at a play on the far side of the field Johnson couldn't keep it a play and it will be a throw into Germany they don't have any options you know if close as God of Gomez he's warming up Gomez is the only proper option closer put Germany in front Podolski added to it option is headed England back into the game and we've got five minutes to go to half time here on five line the line further away will be open for 606 which I'll be presenting heaven knows round probably about five o'clock your time if we don't have extra time if we don't have penalties 0500 909 693 throwing to Germany boating launches the ring to the England penalty area headed away by Barry Schwanksteiger to boating again boating back to Schwanksteiger now down the left side crossing right footed that's a good ball to the captain Lam Lam controls it but not well enough Gerrard's in there and it came off Lam eventually as well and I said printing and throwing I gotta say this German team as well getting under pressure a bit they haven't got a lot of experience in this team other a lot of young players well was that really a throw into Germany yes it was taken by Muller back to Kadirah who's a lookalike he from Milan Barras once a Liverpool and then Germany I lose the way the balls back with David James I tell you the way England were playing 2-1 out of taken at half time yeah yeah but it should be 2-2 here's James still to hit the ball up here the sign of frustration being in goalkeeper he's not sure what proper options he's got it's over that we're getting big James finally clatters it towards the left side towards Gerrard who heads it infield Kadirah doesn't get there lampard heads it on to Rooney Rooney juggles with the ball and then he loses it the Schwanksteiger Schwanksteiger onto closer back now to Muller in a central position Muller Muller ahead of the center circle that's a good ball to the right to Osil Osil now cutting in towards the England penalty on his left foot then beats up and beats the full back call couldn't beat the challenge of Barry and it squirts behind for a goal kick it does that very well doesn't he looks if he's going to say puts Ashley Cole on the ground just over runs it Garith Barry doubling up three minutes to half time folks if you can breath a strain I wasn't nervous before the game but I'm just really now the way this the way this thing is playing out three goals on the first half to the Germany one to England James again slow to take the goal kick now he hits it once more towards Gerrard he's got the beating of Lam in the air ball runs through to Defoe Defoe holds off Murdozaka into Gerrard back now to Barry Gerrard again Gerrard looking for movement upfield but there isn't any so he plays it back to Oppson Gerrard wants more Oppson again onto his left foot and now it's a better ball to Rooney Rooney back to Gerrard and Gerrard hits it directly to the far side great ball to Milner Milner's touch was awful and it's with Podolski who finds the full back bokeh enters fine striker who plays into his goalkeeper who might not have fancied that and he clears it reluctantly towards the far side towards the left Johnson heads it off Podolski and it's out of play for an England throw it 90 seconds before out of time at the end of the first half lampart who denied a clear goal it it wasn't even close here's Rooney back to Barry good ball forward actually cold on the left side why did he get under control first time manages a second time crosses from the left deep poor cleared by Murdozaka out of play for throwing let's say Jeremy off I think Jeremy went off to him with some more in England at the minute England's since I went to no down and really took the game with Jeremy got the goal back shoot I don't know that one but we know a lamp probably haven't given it but it's a England have actually upped the tempo which they should have done from the beginning inside the final men to the first half throw a ghost of Rooney who's beaten by Kedira but the ball breaks up field and here's Terry to find Johnson inside the center circle and Johnson hitting it in the direction of Rooney good play by Lam no one he intercepts it but he plays it carefully to Murdozaka and then Murdozaka is another touch which wasn't so good he finding Lam eventually Lam's clearance upfield intercepted by Upson who just belts it on the half volley behind for a goal kick I'm not gonna tell you any rush to take this just come up half time we just don't see how many minutes are gonna add on he's got the board out now probably be one and maybe two can't think of too many stoppages I better the minute you're listening to five live as you should be except no imitations England one Germany to here comes the fourth official he won't hold it up until 45 bang on England have the ball Rooney's got on the halfway line a minute about a time to be played John Terry Terry onto Milner left by Milner deliberately Johnson chases after can he keep it a play I didn't think he did and I was waiting for the lines when the flag and he flag belatedly it's out for a throwing one is one minute he's just announced but Germany again no rush remind me what to do to that you're a grand linesman should I spot him at an airport later in the tournament I'll be looking for you son ball is with England with cold 20 seconds of the out at time remaining now it's with Upson Jara's getting much more involved he's drifting in saying give the ball to me and I'll direct a first Upson again to Ashley Cole and cold back to Upson it looks as if England are playing out time now at a half time as well it could have been worse folks a lot worse Terry hits it up field towards Rooney who's still not in the game at all and looking showing his frustration he's screaming at the linesman he thinks he should have had a free kick but the truth is weighing you've got to look at your own form it isn't good enough and it is half time Chris got to say Germany for 35 minutes this game should have put the game beyond it should have been three maybe four lamp adds up a half chance and he scored a proper goal but obviously the lanesman was too far up the field to see it cross the lane and England's came in at the last 10 minutes of the half so a little bit the thing keep this tempo up I can see them getting back into the game absolutely says give it England hope with that headed goal half time here in Blumfontein England 1 Germany 2 well without question mark but the ultimate payback really for 1966 in this first half I just wonder how you get to be a linesman at a World Cup officiating in a game of this magnitude and to make a mistake like that complete travesty was outrageous it was two or three feet over the line but we move on and no changes made I don't think by either side the England line at remember it looks like this James who made a couple of important saves actually in that first half Johnson Upson Terry and Cole Milner lampard Barry Gerard Rooney and a foe the Germans with Neuer in gold look too clever when he was put under pressure Larm Friedrich Mertesaker and Boateng Kedirish Weinsteiger Muller Ersel Podolski closer Podolski closer who really haven't had the best of times domestically but 40 goals now for Podolski at international level 50 for closer he's now scored 12 by the way at World Cups and only Muller with 14 ahead of him now having of course appeared in this is third World Cup so where we go in the second half in the second half England play from left to right all in red need to put Germany on the back foot straight away England will need to get Gerard I think more centrally involved as the second half progresses and they need to channel all the aggression and all the hurt they'll be feeling as well certainly will they'll be firing their bellies because they will know that that ball was well over from Frank Lampard and if you're just joining our commentary on five live England really fortunate not to concede early on when James saved from Ersel then the goal route one for Germany goalkeeper took a kick Terry let it bounce Upson Dilly Dallied and then was out muscled by closer James stayed rooted to the spot closest scored one no Germany and then it was Muller who set up Podolski for the second England getting one back through Upson should have been 2-2 at halftime Lampard's goal not given Lampard on the ball now Lampard feeding Ashley Cole over on the far side the left losing the sunshine now and the players will be happier that it's a cooler temperature Gareth Barry running backwards just stepped the ball back to Upson once more Upson who scored against Germany again header on from Rooney looking for Ashley Cole and there's Neuer remember Upson scored his other international goal for England in Berlin in a friendly victory for England 2-1 it's Chris Waddle actually put the right side of the tuck on the right wing now Muller's gone alongside close he's playing in Ersel's role just off the striker why do you think they've done that well it's like I thought give the ball away Muller was having a good game his movement was excellent and he is a center forward normally for Bayern Munich Friedrich falls to main to Foe and the thing is but is and he's gonna get a yellow card here Friedrich he's not gonna miss the next game if Germany get through but the thing is here when England have managed to turn on the gas here and put the German defenders under a bit of pressure towards the end of the first half they look vulnerable this game is not over yet for England they're trailing by two goals to one here in Blomfontein and Lampard edge of the center circle just inside the German half now preparing to take this free kick lifting it in towards Upson easy header away though by Germany Rooney gonna try and head it back in again shot driven in well wide in the end by James Mulder and that's a goal kick to Germany it's just interesting as well since they came up the second half the walk there warming up Jansen as a midfield player and Cruz who's a midfield person I just wonder if Sainz Stegas feeling his arm string slightly they've got them warming up very early well that would be great news for England if Schweinsteiger because he was very very influential in the early part of this game to settle Germany down clearance then by Neuer the German goalkeeper Terry almost lost that one but he managed to recover and now it's Gerard stabbing it straight back to the German defenders and it's going to be a throw in to Germany and of course immediately now they're slowing things down here and taking their time you're listening to five live Germany to England one is the score here it should be two to England having a perfectly good goal not given the linesman not flagging the ball was so far over the line it wasn't true and now the Germans through Larm miss the ball and Gerard takes up possession down the England left here comes Gerard cutting in from the far touch line and a weak shot in the end from Gerard shovel well-wired with Rooney to Foe and Milder all looking for service and Lampard's drifted in there as well Gerard Lacer come and said on that right foot trying to get the shot off pulls it out of the way but it's up England yeah they are thinking it's a goal for it mate with the tempo high and really put this team under pressure they will get equaliser and at some point in the second half and then chasing the game may need Joe Cole to perhaps come on if they're going to get Gerard more centrally involved as Neuer clears now but England at the same time have to be very careful defensively another German goal and that surely would be too much for England to pull back it's two one to Germany and we're in the early stages of the second half Germany now with the enormous figure of Murdersack a finding alarm over on the right hand side is immediately closed down captain against captain there Gerard against Larm and it's quite a slow tempo to the start of the second half that's no good England they've got up the tempo that's what Germany played well when it was slow like it is now that's what they were good at but when England up the tempo and no turn no down Germany couldn't cope with it. Murdersack in the end held it for as long as he could and then gave it back to Neuer and Neuer clears Neuer's ball into the England defense Upson has to be careful judges the header right and Ashley Cole now almost thought about a dangerous ball back in said it's gone back to David James now who clears to the half wayline they're looking now for some aggression from Rooney but it's well one in the air by Friedrich second half just settling down here the ball at times very awkward to control the bounce of the ball long ball hosted forward Murdersack has headed sideways to the far side Larm will keep it in Larm now going past Rooney and then clearing with his left foot his preferred foot in steps Matthew Upson and now Barry with a ball hosted forward not accurately enough though and Germany didn't really need to do that they conceded a thrown over on the far side and the England fans lifted up for their team Germany leading by two goals to one in the early stages here at the second half Germany to know up after 32 minutes by the way now it's Johnson of England always hit that straight at Padovsky and England have a thrown down below on the right hand side Fabio Capello we see for the first time just motioning to Wayne Rooney already five minutes gone in the second half Barry now turning away from Kedira Barry's ball to the far side trying to find Gerard it hits the head of Muller and it's going to be a throw into England on the half wayline Cole that's Ashley Cole throwing it back to Matthew Upson this is five live at the World Cup two one to Germany England just for once are going to have to battle back against the Germans in the World Cup and it's now Stephen Gerard flattened on the half wayline referees played an advantage it was a foul by Schweinsteiger Terry into Rooney Rooney though doesn't control it he's won a free kick against Friedrich and it's a free kick to England about 15 yards inside the German half chance here to test the goalkeeper Neuer once more Lampard stands over the ball Lampard should have scored his first goal at a World Cup tournament here it was not given it was clearly over the line it would have made it 2-2 so here comes Frank Lampard now would he go for power here and try and get the goalkeeper to make a save and then they'll come rushing in for the bits and pieces Lampard's poised Neuer moves around on his line and here comes Frank Lampard with a goal hit the bar Lampard strikes the bar it takes an awful long time to come back in Upson couldn't get it and it's boating and clears to the far side what has Lampard got to do to score here he's already had one goal which should have been given he's hit the bar with a thunderous free kick and England come forward once more now Terry on to Johnson two on to Germany but the game is there for England if they can just keep it going here Milner with a poor ball in though way above the foe and Rooney they need better delivery than that it's a goal kick what a terrific start by Frank Lampard wasn't it what 30 yards terrific hit and goalkeeper now we're near it third team lucky hopefully for Frank but England's got a good tempo here Germany are struggling to look tired and the Ryung say they're inexperienced they're feeling the pressure well England were all over the place in the first half an hour they could have been out of the game totally but now they coming back strongly here but they must score the next goal Germany now looking to Muller over on the far side on to close who's given offside and that's a free kick to England but there's the danger for England there's always a threat when you've got more close to Padozko on the left the Nersle just playing off there but this back four is getting tested now and the two boys in midfielder not dominating any more two German boys free kick to England which goalkeeper James will take seven nearly eight minutes gone in the second half Germans leading here by two goals to one they were good value in the opening half an hour that England getting back into the game and then stung by that goal which wasn't given and I'm aware of the fact that you may be joining us all the time and it you know we can't go on too much about 1966 but of course everyone knows what happened there with the Jeff Hirst goal and here well this one there was absolutely no debate at all no no debate it was two three feet over the line from Frank Lampard it would have made it two two instead and now Neuer is really taking a lot of time the referee needs to really impose himself here this is deliberate time wasting as Germany's goalkeeper now clears into the England half there's no challenge coming in from any England player Ersel drops the ball back to Schweinsteiger on the half wayline and now boating into Ersel and Schweinsteiger looking to lay it forward to Pudolski but England you feel are starting to get it an initiative here if they can just carry it on Johnson back again to James that was uncertain play by the two of them James clears and the trouble for England is there's not much height up front when they get the ball forward neither Defoe nor Rooney can trouble Murdersacker oh and now that's lost the ball easily it's closer for Germany poor play from England closest ball in John Terry's in the way and it's a corner kick to Germany far side the right John Terry sloppy ball to Alpsen it didn't get near him and close I read it and he was away down at right hand side yes Terry's recovered to put it out for a corner to Germany which would be no rush again Ersel's drugged over there well another goal for Germany and it really will be very hard to see England getting back into this game two one they lead and it's a short corner drag back to Philippe Larm Larm back again to Ersel wide on the right back again to Larm they're teasing England now the cross comes in and Wayne Rooney's there with a defensive header and this time it'll be a throw to Germany over on the far side but Germany now just having a few moments inside being them half throw in which again they're taking a long time over ball thrown down to Larm and now it's Ersel trying a couple of tricks down that right hand side and Larm takes over and it's a typical charge from him Gerard is there with a good smothering challenge and Germany winner throne which I suspect Larm was looking for anyway by the corner flag two on to Germany on five live and 35 more minutes to go in this game ball thrown back to Murdersharker Murdersharker finding Larm again down the German right they're just keeping possession here the Germans oh still on to Muller almost got that back to Ersel and now Kudera into the area good play good one twos there from Germany outcomes David James he wants to launch England and he finds Lampard and Lampard takes the ball now into the German half he's got Gerard on the outside the left hand side here comes Steven Gerard the England captain taking on Philip Larm plays the ball into central midfield to Barry Ashley Coles made a run Gerard again now for England Gerard from the angle wasted really hits it straight to the goalkeeper he's not going to score from there Steve and Gerard he has got talent in that right foot but there's no way he's going to be the goalkeeper from that angle he's got three red shirts again in the box where Mooney was in a terrific position selected the shot we're here from Graham Taylor in a moment for the first time in the second half as Johnson has to take care of Fadolski down there and Johnson keeps it in two one to Germany oh Johnson very careless as Chris Waddle thumps the table here in frustration and exasperation Johnson with very poor control there handing back once more the ball to Germany it's the tall figure of Boateng the left back Boateng's ball in towards Muller one has been a real handful for England today and now England take possession and Gerard from quite a long way out just about gets enough on the ball to send it back to David James and here's Graham Taylor yeah I'd like to hear higher tempo from England but one of the things that have noticeable is that Barry Gareth Barry is certainly hanging back looking round and lampard getting forward as you said towards the end of the second half but he's certainly doing more of that in the in in this particular half as well. The ball on to the foe, out comes the goalkeeper who just arrives in the nick of time to thwart Jermaine Defoe the only problem that personally I'm having here is that there is still anxiety every time Germany go forward the England centre backs not really on top form today it's Stephen Gerard from a long way out and again he's wasted it the intent was right there from the England captain but it's there's no power in the shot there's no direction and it's gone wide this game is not over yet but England must score the next goal you feel 12 and a half minutes gone in the second half Germany already quite transparently wasting time here and it's La Montage-Scheinsteiger who's missed his kick and Chris Waddle wondering how Fitz-Scheinsteiger might be England now it's enticing up to do oh actually goal dangerous ball Barry has to scramble it back quickly England mustn't be careless like that and now Barry with the ball towards Rooney who's easy and they need to keep the ball down as well when they get it for there's no point putting in the air towards Mertersacker will win those all day two under Germany on five live and nearly 15 minutes gone in the second half already moving towards the time that Capello may think about changes at the same time he's mindful of the fact that this could still go to penalties hasn't got to take off any of his penalty takers yet and that's a really dreadful ball by Epson again it's the third time he's done that really poor ball nothing ball forward straight back again to the German goalkeeper and doyer we look at substitution show I know Joe Coles be mentioned and I'm sure he's got a chance I just want to see somebody get the ball off the back for and pass it forward you can put Gerard in there we know that and we could put somewhere under Joe Coles on the left but we need someone who's going to get the ball in the middle of the park and start hitting a bit of quality forward to the two straighters and to the two wade men a game of complete frustration for England the disallow of it I say keep saying disallowed it wasn't given it should have been given but also the sense that England can put the Germans under pressure here but now they're having to defend themselves Padoski apart from scoring has been quite quiet here's the danger man now Muller nice change of pace English show him along they showed him too much of the goal there Muller and in the end he drags a shot wide but he's the player this young 20 year old England are having problems picking up he's very tall composed on the ball and England just haven't managed to track him at all well if you look at that John Terry he goes past John Terry he's not there go Barry it's actually Coles run right across the box China put him off so half an hour to go here in Blumfontein Germany leading by two goals to one England looking to try and climb up the gears here in the second half it's an hopeful ball from Ashley Cole but again it's in the air and Mercer sack it just stoopes and heads it down to his captain Lam Lam's ball in now to closer closer and Padoski for Germany up some pulling one back for England who'd now want to throw in over on the far side but the talking point and my word will it be a talking point if England go out will be the goal that should have been given Lampard's strike off the bar two or three feet over the line Rooney almost got Gerard through there it's Ashley Cole is venturing forward now for England Rooney for England almost got into Lampard it was over hit though but Rooney normally would make those sorts of passes and out comes the goalkeeper once more Neuer to throw downfield that was a terrific what's no I don't throw you just throw it straight out of play ridiculous that was a lamp on board which made Rooney play the past that's what you see will on board you've got to get them forward I agree with Alan Green this is not a great German side in terms of the history of the country but now it's Wayne Rooney for England in rain Rooney's ball towards Milder Melnus ball that was well held by Neuer this time excellent great was really good handling in the six yard area by the German goalkeeper that was a decent ball to mind the full gambles at the up post maybe it's a good save held it well Upton now doesn't get the ball away from closer but Barry steps in on the halfway line and Gareth Barry now motoring for England on to Rooney Rooney goes past one defender Rooney sets it up for Milner can Milner score hit it straight at boating good block there by the left back but that's so much better for England who are starting to open up this German defense well it's starting to get stretched out the two boys in midfield are feeling the pace for Germany that's allowing England now to pick up all the second balls Milner for England down the right hand side this time with his left foot looking to play in Rooney again only finds the head of Murdersack a Germany clear closer reaches for it but Terry managed to get a boot in and the Germans failed to clear and it's Ashley Cole for England remember Germany leading by two goals to one Cole can't get past Philippe Lam though and Lam doing very well from that far side gives it back to Murdersack who smoothly finds Schweinsteiger and that's really good play now by Germany out of defense Terry winning the ball back and Barry referee the Muller's thrown himself down and it's Frank Lampard now lovely ball by Lampard Rooney's got away from the defender looking for the bow he goes to bow Gerard was almost in there Friedrich just managed to get a foot on the ball the defender and England almost through there Germany are feeling the place England's up the tempo slightly in the two boys in midfield as they could either and stay in space they've gone on the ball but they're not competing anymore Jochen Lo maybe the manager who has to make changes here but of course England every time Germany go forward have to make sure the doors closed as Podolski plays a very good ball into Wurzel Podolski goes for the return sends it square to Kedira Kedira now looking for help from Schweinsteiger Schweinsteiger tries a shot! Oh just wide James I think had it covered in the cricket England are 100 for two with 28 overs left leading another 113 to win the match in the series against Australia Chris Wadden. Well that was a shot again by Schweinsteiger after a close-over was running into far post was going to get a slip it's like a simple tap in for Friedrich and he's all box. It's not about Becken though huh? Well Germany at full stretch at times defensively against England Rooney got away from his marker really well then and now here comes Defoe Jermaine Defoe finds Milner down the England right Rooney's in the penalty area Cross doesn't come in it should have done really from Milner there's a lazy ball by Milner and now Milner and Johnson trying to take care of Podolski Johnson Lampard's appealing for the free kick but Germany come on a counter attack once more to one they lead the dangerous Ursul onto Kedira the two young players have come into the side back again to Ursul calling for it over on the far side is Thomas Muller it's now with Boateng the left back is try shot here and he needs to bother that's gone a long way into the fans behind David James's goal we've played 18 and a half minutes in the second half Germany to England one that was a half-time school. I think what you said earlier in the second half mate next goals vital Germany get it you got to say they'll go on and win it if England get it after England could call and win it. Well here comes the first change for England and Joe Cole who told me a couple of days ago he doesn't mind if he only gets on for a minute he'll give everything and he's coming on here for James Milner so Joe Cole let's just see where he's going to play he's gonna play in Milner's position is he down the right hand side yep so Joe Cole on for England Harry Rednapp I can see just a few yards away of course he's being linked with Joe Cole trying to sign him for spurs next season so the first change of the game sees Joe Cole who'll be bright and bubbly and here he comes now for the first time. Mustn't try too hard though Joe Cole. Cole taking German defenders with him and now Lampard to the far side of the field looking for Gerard the bounce is awkward that's the problem with this ball normally that would have found the feet of Gerard who's acknowledging Lampard's attempt and it's out of play for a German throw in and we played nearly 20 minutes of the second half well England have had some good pressure but they haven't been able to make it count here and remember denied a perfectly good equalizer in the first half England looking to go forward once more I'm just wondering how much longer Defoe will stay down there he's not getting much change against these German defenders they have Heskey they have Crouch of course as a possible alternative now it's Johnson of England Johnson moves the ball to Joe Cole just in front of Fabio Capella good ball in field to Lampard now Lampard's ball was a nothing one you thought Joe Cole would continue his run and out comes Neuer once more in the German goal to make the save to onto Germany you want to keep the tempo up but you've just got to relax when you get the ball you know they're trying to force it don't try and force it keep the tempo up better ball from Lampard this time Joe Cole now hending down this near side lovely ball in field to Rooney Rooney's looking for Gerard perhaps to make a run oh he was blocked there by Friedrich who's already on a yellow card in this game remember that was a cynical professional foul ready from Friedrich and England have a free kick now remember Lampard struck the crossbar from much further out and now can Lampard get the goal that he should have been given in the first half should have scored hit the bar in the second third time lucky for Frank well he took a free kick in the first half which went straight into the German wall Neuer who hasn't been always convincing in the German goal stands by his near post England have got everybody forward apart from Ashley Cole free kick for Lampard needs one of his better ones here Lampard straight into the German wall once more Barry steps in for England he's floated on the edge of the area by Lama now the break is on for Germany if they measure the pass right they find Podolski England a stretch to bid here it's Schweinsteiger Schweinsteiger for Germany trying to release Mullah Mullah's on site can finish England oh he has gone Thomas Mullah on the counter attack fed by Schweinsteiger has probably now put this game beyond England despite all of the pressure in the second half Mick Jagger's here today I'm afraid it could be all over now but tell you what why don't you leave three but you know he's gonna hit the target with a free kick I try to hit the target who've got one back on the half wheeling in the three plays you did want a break for Germany well it's real come away with it and Mullah probably being the best player in the park today great finish it was always gonna happen pressure pressure pressure from England classic breakaway and Mullah who's been such a handful for England throughout the game scores to make it 3-1 to Germany and is at any way back we're moving towards the halfway point of the second half as Gerard now tries to release Ashley Cole we said the next goal was vital the controversy of the lampard goal not given in the first half halfway point of the second half Alan Green well I'm not giving up on this yet there's still 22 and a half minutes and by the way in the last few minutes of Mike's commentary we've been told officially here that the referee on seeing images of the lampard effort in the first half responded by saying oh my god so at least he knows a rickett was made but it's 3-1 now no point dwelling too much on that lampard effort Germany certainly have a huge advantage Johnson lost the ball there when he really shouldn't have done Kedira forward Johnson gets in makes a tackle still can't get the ball back for England now it's boating chipping it in from the left side oh that's gonna run again to all our mother shot right midfield all over the place tell you Mullah just drips in actually Cole doesn't know whether they go in I would change it now I'd get Husky or Crouch on now and you bet them I was I would kick and rush we can't play mid football the teams you may as well put a target up there it's as well that that was a slight shot from Muller Grand Taylor I have to say this that I think Mullah has been Germany's best player I think the intelligence of them and for such a young man as well has been excellent England have a hard task now ahead of them there's no doubt about that here's lampard in a good position back to Barry Barry's past to Jared was awkward Jared crossed it took an affliction off lamb and it's a corner to England I'm not a response by England but they always look dodgy on there they kind of defend this counter attack in Germany I would put somebody on now a front some target go for it Gerard's corner from the left hit right footed deep too deep headed away by Kedira and out of play it goes and I'm looking down Emil haski it will enter the fray very shortly throwing by Johnson at the terror he's done over the attack and then cold with a weak attempted cross cleared by Germany above the halfway line and he's away he's away my goodness Ozil into the penalty here you only have to pull the ball back it's 4-1 Germany Muller scored again on the counter attack and now we can't say it's all over now put Heskey on it sent off this is unbelievable every counter to why don't they leave through body back with a bit of pace England's defending has been awful absolutely awful it's 4-1 to Germany and the man of the match Muller has got his second goal and he deserves it the youngster well I don't know what we can expect from Emil Heskey now you know something and I know you said about the foe what has really done not just in this game but in this world cup nothing England to restart but not before the substitution is made and it's Heskey for the fold oh well the leading goals in the turn of blowout when put the ball in it if Heskey knocks it down oh 500 909 6 9 3 is the number to call for 6 0 6 which comes up at 5 o'clock here on 5 live England won Germany 4 in Blumfonte Terry's had a shocker Upson has been poor I have no great faith that either full back nor on the goalkeeper but is that leaving the defense that you can praise oh wait did you say that go also even nukes make actually cold how easy is that not while it's bearing on humiliation so young players he's taken Muller off feeling sorry for England yeah Muller's going to be replaced by Gomez and here's another change closest being taken off replaced by Tarkovsky and is there going to be a how many changes we have here oh gum was on for yeah uh Tarkovsky on for Muller and Tarkovsky on from Muller oh dear dear heaven help us 18 minutes to go it looks like it'll be Germany against Argentina on Mexico Argentina playing Mexico tonight commentary on five live at 7 30 pesky claims that he was farled the referee's given the free kick well I hope the referee in the line can sleep well in their beds tonight you know free kick to England midway inside the German half England right Barry's going to take it Upson and Terry are up there Barry plays it in toward the far post that comes noir and noir with both fists punches it away either playing the far side of the field for a throw in to England who have only 18 minutes to go and can they score three times in 18 minutes and now another throw in conceded but further away from the danger area England throw Terry's about to take it throwing it to lampard back to Terry chipped on to Gerard Gerard lost it initially wins it back finds lampard on a Gerard again good challenge by murder zacker and England are prone to the counter attack again here it's played down the left hand side padolski can't keep it a play though and it's a throw into England every time they nick the ball on the edge of the box you think go they've got so much place going forward throwing goes to Joe Cole and that's a terrible ball from Joe Cole terrible and now it should also on this near side of the field to padolski Ozil again and he tried to roll the ball under his right foot Johnson clattered into him and conceded the free kick that was that a frustration and a bit of cheap of course provoked it by Ozil well they are taking the mickey now Germany I don't think they're four one better not four one better but that's what the score line says here's boating into Katera and on night to padolski in the near side of the field back to but boating time is not just running out for England it ran out for England a few minutes ago really long crossfield ball not kept in play on the far side of the field by trokowski and it's a throw in to England taken by Cole to Barry Barry slow almost caught a possession here is caught a possession here but there are three kindly decides that's a free kick all the heads are dying now Terry to Johnson and on to Joe Cole England have to strike very quickly now have to pull it back to four two at least to give any hope all Cole falls over the ball loses it padolski to Katera onto Ozil and Ozil moving in beautiful watch Feinsteiger Johnson belted into Feinsteiger he's very close to a yellow card well next time definitely he could have got it on that's two in a row in the last five minutes but uh England now they're just his heads have gone out on your right people's heads have gone it just you know you look what a bit inspiration we're not even having a go now Germany on total control of this football match quarter of an hour left for play Germany leading four one they've got a free kick Feinsteiger just tap into padolski presumably back to Feinsteiger and on to the near side also back to Boateng Boateng into Feinsteiger and Barry inaggressively wins it well he finds Gerard and Gerard hooked it on and didn't watch where Tarkovsky was Tarkovsky now for Germany little figure running through the midfield the England midfield unfortunately now also back to Boateng just ahead of the halfway line adding under just chasing German passes all over the pitch lamb the captain on the far side of the fin in nine to Gomez Tarkovsky again Tarkovsky back to Schweinsteiger Schweinsteiger guides it to the right side to La back to Katera that's an awful lot of German passes put together now Tarkovsky once more Katera and they give it the ole the German fans and frankly you wouldn't blame them the teams leading four one against their bitterest rivals and a place is ahead in the quarter finals here's padolski scored the second goal padolski running away from Heskey we need a Heskey upfield but it's back to Schweinsteiger Schweinsteiger down to the near side to Oslo and in the last few minutes England have been given a passing lesson by Germany Boateng sorry how long had the ball it's quite unbelievable this they're really I mean they're winning four one and England can't get near them and everybody's trying and that's a sad part people say before the game on the boat this guy 18 Germany here's Katera on the Gomez flight stay down he looked well offside the same lines within the far side of the field nothing came of it interesting to see the replay Gerard to Barry and Barry just outside the center circle now inside the center circle and seemed to overhead the faster Joe Cole called it well to control it finds Rooney Rooney now moving in field and then he's tackled by Schweinsteiger Rooney still has the ball though 13 minutes to go Rooney crosses in towards Cole headed away Rooney looks up disgusted disgruntled figure say what Germany be thinking at five one that's him in Germany trying to get revenge I'm telling you I can see it happening here's Boateng Boateng moving in field and he's inside the England half leaves it for Schweinsteiger to Osil back to Schweinsteiger Schweinsteiger now to Friedrich Schweinsteiger Boateng Schweinsteiger has been unbelievable more than I was being excellent Schweinsteiger is you just can't get near him sorry it's just England cannot get near him in midfield boys but Kader and Schweinsteiger going very quiet at the start of the second half yeah the other just ruling the kingdom look at this now I mean it's it Osil um tackle finally by Terry ball breaks out of play and it'll be a throw into Germany and we've got 12 painful minutes left here in five lines. Tropello's just gone mad at Joe Cole saying what you're doing over there get yourself on the right I'm sorry that's all into play just to generally get back on the left that is going to make a lot of difference to be perfectly honest but cry a little over 40,000 watching what has become a debacle for England. To her header away by Johnson, Fadolski shoots blocked by Ubsen's body ball rebounds to Lampard back to Geron, Rooney's further stop field the pass goes to Joe Cole, Cole now to Lampard, Ashley Cole's available on the far side that's a good ball to Cole Lord Bones dorkwoodly Cole heads it back Barry takes it on his chest onto Cole they want to get the ball down England instead it goes out of play and it's going to be a throw into Germany. He's got it against Wijnstegel oh where's John Terry going oh here's Gomez leaving Terry running at Ubsen running into the penalty area Ubsen still holding up oh Gomez shoots high and wide he shouldn't have shot should he've done well he got near the bi-lane he should just play it off Ubsen I turned back out and kept possession no response at all from England no none at all we've got 11 minutes to go Johnson with a clearance upfield towards Heskey, Heskey good header to the right side to Joe Cole Cole gets the ball on the floor back to Lampard Lampard sluggish again to Barry and on to Cole on the far side Geron breaks forward but Cole plays it in field to Barry England are so slow now they've lost almost lost the ball there Barry when there should have been no pressure on them at all Ubsen plays it behind Terry and Terry look at that you know there's no German player within 40 yards and he couldn't bring the ball under control at least not initially running to Lampard on to Geron Geron feeds it overheads the ball towards the left side well ahead of Ashley Cole and it's behind for a goal kick I don't know what to say I'm just you know we were talking before the game I knew German's a dangerous team I've said that all along but England's made them look like world champions and I know we'll say if Lampard's goal goes in there's a change of face to get apart from that the cook were part first off half an hour second off off an hour we haven't got near them Argentino take them here's Joe Cole midway inside the German half a elaborate dive from Joe Cole it wasn't a free kick Lampard takes it off from Heskey's pass Lampard right side Lampard now it glides it in towards Barry Geron moves forward running to Geron into the penalty area Geron shoots wide what a save what a save actually he got a touch in it no what we'll say that was that was a little bit better buying in a little bit quicker little given goal Geron takes it lovely little trick to get the space in what a left-handed save by Noah brilliant save good save inside the last 10 minutes England corner played into the penalty area had he cleared Cole on the volley shoots at goal but it's cleared by Germany again and also is brought down by Johnson at a yellow card and if England were to appear in the quarter finals Johnson would not be in the team but of course that's a formality it ain't going to happen but he's quick show there Johnson that's his third fold in the last 10 minutes so he's heading for it and he got it the caption on the television monitor says miss his next match as if that matters another change for Germany Kessling yeah a striker well I don't know who do you bring off it's a adult skier I think you may take Ursula off Schweinsteiger for Germany this is painful to commentate on Germany of finishing this game so superior to England into Katera Schweinsteiger again in the center circle Schweinsteiger plays it casually with the outside of his right foot accurately to Podolski into Ozil there are more goals for Germany here if they want them Schweinsteiger back to Boateng Boateng now to Podolski Boateng again Podolski goodness gracious Joe Cole was late there and the referee saw it Podolski to Ozil Johnson in with a challenge that's a far more excited play and I think the Uruguayan referee just having a very quiet word with Joe Cole it is indeed Ozil who's coming off yeah and Kessling Kessling coming on well Ursula me started the first 20 minutes he looked very nervous lost the ball but he's always an influence over this team play he links the play up ever so well it's a very good play and a big big future and they go well Capella may as well may as well send on Beckham in his suit for all the difference it will make England won Germany four on five line seven minutes to go Germany throwing cleared by Johnson out of play and another throw to Germany Boateng to take it why you look at my stopwatch hoping that it's rushing towards the 45 minutes because I think Germany's gonna score again here's Ashley Cole on the far side of the field options behind him Cole's under pressure loses the ball that's terrible here's Kessling and then England forced it that Barry made it into reception and gets it back to David James Ashley Cole losing it losing the ball far too easy it's just something to know I know people might say we're all about that was go rightly so it was a goal but I've got to say the best team's winning the number to call to join in 606 0 599 693 padalski great ball into Kessling back to Schweinsteiger in the center circle Schweinsteiger just runs away casually from Barry finds Boateng then Boateng's pass was behind padalski here's Lampard to Gerard that has to be considerable thought given to what England do after this shambles of a World Cup with one decent display against Slovenia semi-decent but remember the standard of the opposition not the highest and ultimately whatever the grumbles about Lampard's quote non-goal we end up being outplayed by Germany my optimism before the game totally misplaced blind faith here's Kadeera Kadeera and Irish finds and on to padalski back to Boateng a little over five minutes ago it's hit up field Upsum was back there and the ball runs through to James and Mick Jagger as Mike was saying watching on was watching on last night in Rustenberg a usn garrings sitting it doesn't bring any team much slope busy now here's Kaisling stay away making future Kaisling a yard outside the penalty area not a good ball to Tchaikovsky Tchaikovsky still gets there beats Ashley Cole easily on the inside up to the edge of the penalty area the pass back allowed by Schveinstegger to reach Kadeera now it's Lampard on the far side of the field Germany leading 4-1 right Phillips will be coming on shortly for England what difference will that make what's the point Schveinstegger on the far side of the field back to the centre serve to the Friedrich Friedrich plays that forward like the most cultured midfield players to the left side of Podolski exchanges passes with Boateng and then he threads it towards Kaisling intercepted by John Terry John Terry has the ball again inside the penalty area back it goes to David James and we've got four and a half minutes to go before the added insult of added time I can't believe what I'm saying I think Germany's a very good say I got to see I said before I don't but England I can't since they went four down they've just they've choked it they've never they've never even put them on any pressure they've never had a go Gerald's had a shot which was a great save apart from that Germany must had last 10 minutes they must had 80 percent of the possession look they've got it again well they've never gone more than 20 years between winning World Cups Germany they won in 1990 who knows here's Gomez forward Gomez steps in the ball inadvertently picked up by Kedira this is shocking for me and then finally the flags up for offside to relieve the pain Glenn comes right Phillips for Glenn Johnson I think probably they're thinking that actually Johnson's only is left by he's that he's trotting off injured that's where he's been turned off by Dossky that many times oh dear oh dearie dearie and you won Germany four we know what we'll do Alan after this we'll go home and we'll say we'll try and say the lensman got it all wrong with a goal but she did and that'll be it and we'll say right what we're going to do and four years time we'll be saying exactly the same thing we'll be going through the same agony as usual except this time we don't even have the quarter finals Chris we're not good enough why do people always build us up and this is swunder team we're not it's a media thing but it's definitely a media driven thing and the players are indulgent they like it as well they talk themselves up we have it we haven't come to South Africa to do well we've come here to win it yeah oh dear it's fine stagger I still don't think this German team will win it right look they've got they've got on the day they've started they've had five players so I'm gonna 21s how many under 21s will we have in this team we're getting this team here's runy who's had a shocking world cup and uh it's tackle easily losing the ball at least it's a corner well you know I hope nobody starts building up Wayne Rooney again next season after this Rooney himself is going to take the corner short to Gerard Gerard edge of the penalty area onto Rooney into the penalty area and Rooney shoots it go blocked a 10th shot a goal by Barry it's blocked two behind for another corner well you just switched off yeah they do what they want it was like saying go and score if you want we still didn't always right Wayne Rooney doing taking the corner in the first place now it's Gerard to take it from the right side lots of red shirts in the German penalty and Rooney just walked in his right but at the ball it's like oh it doesn't matter and he called over the outside he was right but it looked in the air and was caught by Neuer such disinterest but what I'm saying is pitiful and they've got five under 21s or maybe six in the squad right but they've developed their game what it's well it's coaching from young whatever our game's going backwards it's and we keep saying they're sending every tournament we do nothing about it Rooney to Lampard 30 yards out shits a goal save for the goalkeeper well we've had two three chances in three minutes a bit late yeah and also just you know it feels that it doesn't matter Germany or not is your excuse for Germany's Germany's not that interested now no no but what what do you put that Rooney attempt down to I couldn't care less I've done look I'm sure Rooney does care and now the linesman should have had the flag up there against Kiesling it doesn't matter in the end because it's out of play for a throw in we're inside the final minute of the game what will be two minutes oh no I think they'll have at least three just to pour on the agony at least three 0500 999 693 is the number to call if you want to chat to me on 606 which will be coming up in a round about a quarter of an hour the England's World Cup is over here in Blum Fonsa you know I watched the result of the two games yesterday and I thought England should have been in that half of the draw they really should have one group say Alan had half an hour 45 minutes maybe against Slovenia that's it that's it passed down the right side to right Phillips right Phillips control was in great then he gets the cross in and it's saved on the air post by Neuer there's the board how many minutes go on you guys will make it four two thank heavens for that thank you very much you're a going into time out it on for stoppages four one to Germany Neuer hits it up field right Phillips allows it to go out of play and there will be a throw in to England and you look around the hundreds of flags that adorn this arena flags of the cross of St George people who spent what thousands of pounds getting here and what have England given up nothing well tell you 45 minutes in probably all action put the whole games together and they probably did 45 minutes of what we expect well that's not good enough out of four matches well 90 minutes of play each time that's 360 minutes 45 good minutes yeah I would say lampard picks it up field it was always ahead of really but normally really would have been rushing after it it bounces through to Neuer and you've only got 60 seconds to count down now folks well I hope you're fine everybody's looking at this we need to change our system and we're not and we'll be saying the same thing in the year old we'll be saying the same thing in Brazil Kedira onto Schweinsteiger and Schweinsteiger runs away from Barry he's approaching the penalty it's a great run by Schweinsteiger he's got Podolski to his left the pass hit right full still reach Podolski back to Schweinsteiger there's still a chance for 5-1 here for Germany back to Kedira and thankfully Kedira turns away from goal initially now it's the boating in the near side of the field Schweinsteiger wants more Schweinsteiger rolling the ball under his right foot he's been quality hasn't he I mean he's a right side in midfield he converted his centre and he's ran the game by an east tackle he's offside oh he's offside he's absolutely ran again with a bad hamstring and that at least that means it's an England free kick and with only seven seconds to go about in time at least we're not going to lose by five goals to one Ashley Cole on the far side of the field the rear ground referee blows his whistle England's World Cup is over it's finished in a dreadful defeat to Germany absolutely shocking England won journey four well I've got to say it's totally embarrassing I think yep you know Germany dominated the first 35 minutes England came back yeah it could have been two two half team well let's be honest Germany ran the game from the off second half first ten minutes England had a goal apart from ourselves 20 minutes 20 20 minutes for me in the game England competed and looked like we're going to get there's something for Germany far better team technically tactically absolutely hammered with painful
