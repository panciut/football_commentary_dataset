[0.00 - 7.00] P:1646.56 E:0.067491 |  And the United States as England kick off and get this match underway.
[7.00 - 14.00] P:1663.73 E:0.091882 |  It is Mason Mount who starts things off. England in the almost all-white kit with the blue trim on the shoulders,
[14.00 - 21.00] P:1569.82 E:0.094115 |  the blue numbers on the backs and the United States in an all-darkish blue kit tonight with white numbers on the back.
[21.00 - 28.00] P:1502.84 E:0.094767 |  And the American team just the one change. Hadji Wright, the number 19 coming in up front in place of Josh Sargent,
[28.00 - 34.00] P:1396.91 E:0.093532 |  who's down on the bench, the Norwich City man. So the American team, Turner in goal, the Arsenal goalkeeper at the back,
[34.00 - 41.00] P:1455.11 E:0.088418 |  Dest Zimmerman, Reem and Robinson of Fulham and then Adams of Leeds with Western McKenney and Eunice Musa,
[41.00 - 46.00] P:1565.16 E:0.095437 |  who could have played for England, the 19-year-old but is playing for the United States in this match,
[46.00 - 54.00] P:1572.49 E:0.095321 |  as the ball is played back to goalkeeper Turner, who looked a little awkward there, he was off balance as he was played back to him by Zimmerman,
[54.00 - 59.00] P:1336.10 E:0.095112 |  but he was able to get it away out of play on the far side and to complete that United States line-up.
[59.00 - 64.00] P:1562.54 E:0.099001 |  Timothy Ware, who scored their first goal at this world cup, the opening goal against Wales on the right,
[64.00 - 70.00] P:1597.04 E:0.092462 |  Christian Pulasik of Chelsea on the left and as I say Hadji Wright taking over from Josh Sargent.
[70.00 - 77.00] P:1500.27 E:0.091300 |  And Hadji Wright of Antalya Spore, he plays his football in Turkey, he's a big guy, 6'3 tall.
[77.00 - 83.00] P:1563.20 E:0.097294 |  And here he is, the ball played through to him but it's got too much on it and England just see it back to goalkeeper Pickford,
[83.00 - 89.00] P:1502.45 E:0.087656 |  who clears long left footed for the half-way line where it's headed forward by Zimmerman,
[89.00 - 96.00] P:1346.14 E:0.087819 |  who conceded the penalty from which Gareth Bale equalised in their first match in the group.
[96.00 - 107.00] P:1506.64 E:0.102792 |  And then there is a foul for a challenge by Luke Shaw, which has resulted in Dest actually being bundled off the field.
[107.00 - 114.00] P:1472.09 E:0.097934 |  So it's a free kick on the far side, get noise inside the ground, Rob Green, England 0, USA 0 in the second minute.
[114.00 - 119.00] P:1557.17 E:0.088862 |  Yeah, lively atmosphere and a lively start from both sides, they just initially iron each other up,
[119.00 - 126.00] P:1423.86 E:0.091459 |  but then when they saw the moments about both sides when they had possession, drove forwards really fast.
[126.00 - 132.00] P:1570.47 E:0.091562 |  The Kenny for the United States then just saw an opportunity to go, drove through in the field, creating an opening.
[132.00 - 140.00] P:1559.93 E:0.095196 |  So England got a press early, they'll get opportunities from it because the US 96 do leave themselves exposed at times.
[140.00 - 151.00] P:1443.78 E:0.094556 |  The ball just being played back to his goalkeeper by Zimmerman, he's the only player in this line-up to actually plays in the United States.
[151.00 - 158.00] P:1500.19 E:0.098602 |  All of the rest of them dotted around the world, many in Europe and many in England, of course, familiar names that you will know.
[158.00 - 167.00] P:1467.93 E:0.097693 |  So McKenney and Moosa from this midfield, they call it the MMA midfield for the United States, both McKenney and Moosa were doubtful for this match, little doubts,
[167.00 - 172.00] P:1510.71 E:0.096828 |  but both okay, and as you will gather, both started the match.
[172.00 - 179.00] P:1425.01 E:0.095039 |  So the United States attacking down the right, they thought they'd want to throw in, but it's England's throw level with the edge of their own penalty area.
[179.00 - 183.00] P:1513.85 E:0.093520 |  In the first half here, England as we look are playing from left to right.
[184.00 - 192.00] P:1450.65 E:0.095279 |  So the England defending the end where the masked ranks of the England supporters are mainly dressed in red and white down to the left.
[192.00 - 200.00] P:1483.51 E:0.087716 |  Throw in to Raheem Sterling, one of the scorers in that record-breaking opening win for England at a World Cup.
[200.00 - 207.00] P:1372.04 E:0.093860 |  Sterling still inside his own half, then it's headed forward into USA territory, and they knock the ball along the back line,
[207.00 - 218.00] P:1338.72 E:0.093940 |  and then played forward up towards Poulisset near the centre-circle, who takes it back into his own half and gives it back once again to Waucat Zimami to his left, to Kim Reem.
[218.00 - 225.00] P:1467.31 E:0.094468 |  It seemed he was probably out of the picture for this World Cup squad, but things changed, and Reem plays it forwards down the left-hand side by Anthony Robinson,
[225.00 - 229.00] P:1435.19 E:0.093698 |  his clubmate can take on, but the touch was heavy and it's out of play for a throw in to England.
[229.00 - 236.00] P:1329.15 E:0.093189 |  Yeah, it's interesting down his left-hand side, he got a real battle, Zaka, who's more offensive minded.
[236.00 - 239.00] P:1468.32 E:0.098824 |  Robinson also at left back, offensive minded, loves to get forward.
[239.00 - 244.00] P:1518.02 E:0.091478 |  Poulisset tends to drift inside and he'll bomb on, that creates a space for him to go on.
[244.00 - 250.00] P:1493.42 E:0.093791 |  So Kieran Trippier will have his hands full, not only initially with Poulisset, but then with Robinson coming on as well.
[250.00 - 260.00] P:1332.56 E:0.092759 |  Sure plays it to Sterling over on the far side, and then Sterling goes back into his own half, and it's all the way back to Galky Pickford again.
[260.00 - 269.00] P:1302.07 E:0.101171 |  47th cap tonight for Pickford, so if England continue throughout the tournament, there's every chance that he, like the man just in front of him now,
[269.00 - 276.00] P:1328.27 E:0.095987 |  Harry Maguire will be reaching that half-century at the tournament, but that's further down the line.
[276.00 - 286.00] P:1437.38 E:0.093358 |  Harry Maguire is the, now the sixth man in this squad to reach 50 caps for England, as Harry Kane, one of them winning his 77th tonight,
[286.00 - 296.00] P:1297.55 E:0.090793 |  is bundled over, didn't get on the score sheet in the first match as you will know, but that means that he's still one goal away from becoming England's record scorer
[296.00 - 304.00] P:1499.59 E:0.089712 |  in tournament finals, World Cup European Championship combined with currently 10 leveled with Gary Lenaker.
[304.00 - 307.00] P:1502.20 E:0.096008 |  England with the ball in the back with John Stones.
[307.00 - 315.00] P:1463.28 E:0.108812 |  Now back to Maguire, this is a much more patient approach from England tonight, there's a greater respect being shown to the opposition.
[315.00 - 326.00] P:1451.53 E:0.103683 |  They really went in around in the early stages, but this is much more caging as Maguire in possession plays into his right to Stones with Hadji Wright closing him down.
[326.00 - 336.00] P:1445.41 E:0.100413 |  Stones puts his foot on the ball, just pops it into Bellingham who's come deep to get it, and then here is Maguire again, he goes for the long pass which is out of play,
[336.00 - 343.00] P:1440.83 E:0.099816 |  and this plays by Maguire, Shaw actually set off on the run and Maguire played it behind him and out for a thrill, error from Maguire.
[343.00 - 354.00] P:1474.32 E:0.088440 |  Interesting tactically that you're looking at England, looking to slow it down, they know how quick, how impressive the United States are on the counter attack, on the press,
[354.00 - 365.00] P:1428.31 E:0.090999 |  but the USA themselves had changed it, they were 4-3-3 directly up against the three centre halves of Wales, now they just select into a 4-4-2 when they don't have possession,
[365.00 - 371.00] P:1410.35 E:0.087558 |  so England bide in their time at the back, waiting for the moment, but being matched up at the same time.
[371.00 - 382.00] P:1421.99 E:0.095220 |  The United States have the ball, it's played out towards the left-hand side where Robinson, Anthony Robinson, double E for Anthony, turns and gives it back to the halfway line and it's blocked out of play by Mason,
[382.00 - 393.00] P:1519.33 E:0.097187 |  the throwing which actually came off the American, and that's been disputed by Tyler Adams, I think he had a case there as well, but it's given us a throw to England.
[393.00 - 402.00] P:1308.90 E:0.088967 |  I think he's always got something to say to Tyler Adams captain, as we heard this morning, with Rick Edwards very entertaining,
[402.00 - 413.00] P:1372.08 E:0.101052 |  Robinson on the bench tonight, the other legion I did midfield at, Kane takes it forward but there is Tim Rean headed back to his goalkeeper, Tim Rean now 35 years old,
[413.00 - 419.00] P:1250.46 E:0.092380 |  so it's very much built isn't it, this American side is one of young guns but there is experience in there as well.
[419.00 - 424.00] P:1390.39 E:0.093008 |  I'm not sure he would have started injuries, committing him being pulled up into the squad, I'm playing,
[424.00 - 432.00] P:1446.05 E:0.097099 |  and it's interesting that they do leave him so exposed at the back when they go forward, when they win the ball, because they go forward in numbers, they get 5-6 forward.
[432.00 - 440.00] P:1422.37 E:0.094815 |  Yeah, Miles Robinson was the big miss at the back, the captain of Atlanta United who tore his Achilles in May,
[440.00 - 446.00] P:1388.72 E:0.084951 |  and it was after that that Tim Rean came back into the picture, before this he hadn't won a cap for over a year.
[446.00 - 453.00] P:1477.27 E:0.091150 |  Here's Robinson on the left hand side for the United States but he runs it out of play, a heavy touch and it's a throw into England level with the edge of their own box.
[453.00 - 462.00] P:1406.05 E:0.085724 |  England nail United States, 0, 5-Live and BBC sounds, and as I hope you've picked up by now, all of the matches, every single one,
[462.00 - 471.00] P:1517.82 E:0.092751 |  there will be coverage when they're being played on 5-Live and BBC sounds, so wherever you are, whatever time you can take, the world cup with you on BBC sounds.
[471.00 - 479.00] P:1289.38 E:0.090974 |  When England playing the ball out to Luke Shaw on the left hand side, but they check back into their own half, and Sterling goes all the way back to McGuire again.
[479.00 - 490.00] P:1319.97 E:0.087047 |  When England have a throw in, every single United States player is in that half of the pitch, and I mean left to right rather than front and forward to back, so the switch is on.
[491.00 - 500.00] P:1188.93 E:0.096764 |  McGuire turning it, board of the far side, Mason Mount has dropped out there, Shaw is there as well, he plays it in field, Shaw having to battle for it back,
[500.00 - 509.00] P:1502.22 E:0.093965 |  and he does win it back, and now England go from left over here to right, Declan Rice with the initial pass, and then forward from Trippiac,
[509.00 - 514.00] P:1677.80 E:0.097190 |  and Robinson back in a defensive position is there to head that out of play.
[514.00 - 526.00] P:1627.19 E:0.083628 |  England nil, the United States nil, it did feel different yesterday when I was in the media conference, the official FIFA media conference before the match,
[526.00 - 533.00] P:1498.60 E:0.093488 |  as England take the throw, and he has Jude Bellingham with it on the right hand side, and I'm just wondering whether he might have hurt himself,
[533.00 - 543.00] P:1528.30 E:0.077827 |  because it just bounced away from him, he miscontrolled it, and the challenge came in on him from Hadgy Wright, but they're all care, they are both back on their feet.
[543.00 - 547.00] P:1623.74 E:0.090996 |  Just the way he reacted there Bellingham, just was a little worry wasn't it?
[547.00 - 549.00] P:1783.94 E:0.086510 |  It was a clumsy touch and the ball got stuck away from him.
[549.00 - 557.00] P:1683.57 E:0.105839 |  Oh nice ball from Trippiac to Bellingham, and Bellingham now running at the defence and giving it to Saka, and then back across to Kane who shot,
[557.00 - 566.00] P:1585.07 E:0.106390 |  takes a deflection off Zimmerman and wide of the foot of the post, and that looked for all the world as though Harry Kane was about to score his first goal of this World Cup.
[566.00 - 573.00] P:1510.42 E:0.108941 |  Corner, that is how you get through a press, fast one-tops football, brilliant attack in football down the right hand side,
[573.00 - 582.00] P:1542.13 E:0.099900 |  it was in exactly the same spot that he gave away the penalty against Wiles, a brilliant block, last sticks, Harry Kane in front of the goal,
[582.00 - 589.00] P:1456.84 E:0.096168 |  you put your house on him to put it away, great block, super block, and so it is in corner from the right hand side,
[589.00 - 594.00] P:1508.81 E:0.091440 |  Neena give Trippiac credit for that, we'll come back to that, but this is the first set-piece England have got,
[594.00 - 602.00] P:1520.09 E:0.097042 |  remember all the talks since Monday about defending and attacking set-pieces, Trippiac plays it in, it is Stones who got his head to it,
[602.00 - 609.00] P:1493.99 E:0.101598 |  and the ball bounces to the far side, it's kept in by Maguire, and Maguire now into the penalty area, and still Maguire, and he's losing it,
[609.00 - 614.00] P:1586.33 E:0.106973 |  and eventually it is cleared away out of the penalty area.
[615.00 - 624.00] P:1583.56 E:0.100798 |  Harry Maguire, as he did made his way into the penalty area, it was a case of, is he going to lose balance, is he going to fall over,
[624.00 - 631.00] P:1481.09 E:0.098071 |  no, is he going to get a shot, and in the end changing the ball from foot to foot, it wasn't exactly Cristiano Ronaldo,
[631.00 - 638.00] P:1220.33 E:0.096856 |  but it ended up with a shot of Mason Mount, and it is a goal kick, it was over the top of the crossbar by a distance,
[638.00 - 643.00] P:1180.20 E:0.100213 |  and the referee has just come across it and said to Harry Kane that he needs to be outside of the penalty area.
[643.00 - 651.00] P:1363.46 E:0.097605 |  I was just about to say it was name RS, it was brilliant feet initially, it was never in fully control over it.
[651.00 - 654.00] P:1364.05 E:0.092122 |  No, that would be fair to say Rob, he was never fully in control.
[654.00 - 657.00] P:1364.47 E:0.083947 |  There was a bit of jeopardy in the situation.
[657.00 - 663.00] P:1263.89 E:0.087670 |  Mr Maguire, were you ever fully in control of the ball? I have to confess I was not.
[663.00 - 666.00] P:1292.12 E:0.089446 |  He was in, he was in though.
[666.00 - 677.00] P:1283.37 E:0.085726 |  Yes, yes. So England nil, United States nil, and suddenly England have upped it there in the last, what, three or four minutes.
[677.00 - 682.00] P:1377.01 E:0.092064 |  They've been biting the time at the back and just trying to find a way, and you see the set moves that they have,
[682.00 - 689.00] P:1436.90 E:0.091072 |  when the ball comes out to Trippier, Saka moves in off the line, and it's been met and they're just teeing it up for the right opportunity.
[689.00 - 693.00] P:1327.57 E:0.089067 |  That was the right opportunity and they got it down to a tee.
[693.00 - 699.00] P:1285.79 E:0.091076 |  So England with the ball deep inside their own half again, stones playing it across to Maguire.
[699.00 - 704.00] P:1383.29 E:0.084591 |  So it's back to, as you were just before that, flurry from England.
[704.00 - 711.00] P:1419.60 E:0.086142 |  But it was, it was a terrific little pass from Kieran Trippier, there's suddenly, it's like flicking a switch from that pass from Trippier,
[711.00 - 714.00] P:1237.17 E:0.089105 |  that started the attack that led to the cane shot that was deflected by.
[714.00 - 721.00] P:1434.57 E:0.091462 |  The difficulty with this press from USA is when you do get it wrong that you are so open,
[721.00 - 728.00] P:1446.66 E:0.094280 |  because it just doesn't take much to get it wrong, half a step, half a yard, a curved run in the wrong direction,
[728.00 - 733.00] P:1388.89 E:0.098934 |  just these fine details, you get them wrong, the quality of the opposition will find you out.
[733.00 - 738.00] P:1400.99 E:0.098789 |  England with it still on the far side, in the central third of the field,
[738.00 - 745.00] P:1383.48 E:0.097478 |  and Lowell Ball played in from the left flank by Sterling, Cain Trippier played with the outside of his group for Saka,
[745.00 - 750.00] P:1308.62 E:0.092845 |  who set up that opportunity for Harry Cain with his ball from the right hand side,
[750.00 - 754.00] P:1173.04 E:0.101824 |  it's played forward on the half way line by Trippier, bounces away,
[754.00 - 760.00] P:1585.04 E:0.095955 |  Bellingham just takes charge in front of Prukayo Saka, Saka bounced off his teammate there,
[760.00 - 765.00] P:1449.23 E:0.097721 |  Bellingham was looking to drive it on having opened his account for England the other evening.
[765.00 - 771.00] P:1340.66 E:0.091795 |  Looking now, America with the ball, all of a sudden just looking to get a breather and giving it away as well.
[771.00 - 774.00] P:1353.17 E:0.086566 |  Yeah, it's come back to them Sterling immediately plays it to the left hand side,
[774.00 - 779.00] P:1436.53 E:0.092854 |  Mount gets it under control, an awkward bouncing ball, sort of trademark style of his,
[779.00 - 786.00] P:1303.39 E:0.092964 |  as he takes it down in his stride, Bellingham now to the right hand side, Trippier still 0-0 if you've just joined us on five-life.
[786.00 - 793.00] P:1315.55 E:0.089542 |  The final match of today, the fourth commentary out of the four, out to the left hand side for England, Shaw,
[793.00 - 798.00] P:1211.18 E:0.091963 |  Shaw with Mount there, back it comes to Rice, England now dominating possession,
[798.00 - 804.00] P:1343.45 E:0.099396 |  and now they're passing the ball from left to right inside the USA half, stones to Bellingham,
[804.00 - 809.00] P:1586.17 E:0.106311 |  and now to Trippier on the right hand side, Saka's got space in the box, plays it across with a deflection,
[809.00 - 816.00] P:1474.74 E:0.101140 |  defenders in there, McKenny it was coming back, he was able to head it away in front of Harry Kane and USA clear.
[816.00 - 821.00] P:1507.74 E:0.104960 |  Yeah, now the really important block and that time it's Tyler Adams just stepping out at the wrong time.
[821.00 - 828.00] P:1321.62 E:0.097452 |  This time Shaw on the left hand side, Shaw feels like England are inching themselves further and further forward,
[828.00 - 835.00] P:1336.20 E:0.080887 |  now with the ball just forward of the centre circle, Trippier lifts it again for Saka,
[835.00 - 842.00] P:1338.86 E:0.091711 |  that's another good ball from the Newcastle United man to Saka, the Arsenal, the Premier League leaders, Trippier,
[842.00 - 847.00] P:1508.80 E:0.090509 |  then plays it into the box, it takes a deflection but Turner should come and pick that up.
[847.00 - 856.00] P:1596.35 E:0.087912 |  So Matt Turner, one of Bukalio Saka's teammates of course, but second choice at Arsenal,
[856.00 - 861.00] P:1644.65 E:0.098348 |  first choice for the United States, and first choice for Arsenal is sitting on the bench for England.
[861.00 - 868.00] P:1674.67 E:0.107887 |  Yeah, I agree with that goalkeeping and the real quality that England have in the goalkeeping department now,
[868.00 - 875.00] P:1482.89 E:0.099142 |  but grateful for the breather there, USA, just a moment, looking inside it off last game,
[875.00 - 881.00] P:1588.41 E:0.096321 |  down the left hand side was opening up around, this time down the right, the combinations, they're working.
[881.00 - 888.00] P:1503.20 E:0.090958 |  England nil, USA nil in this match, but if England are able to win it,
[888.00 - 892.00] P:1567.32 E:0.081119 |  then they would confirm their place in the next round of this World Cup,
[892.00 - 898.00] P:1525.41 E:0.088021 |  and probably as group winners because of that qualification criteria I was telling you about,
[898.00 - 904.00] P:1512.29 E:0.080752 |  but it would not be confirmed just yet, but still nil-nil, Rice,
[904.00 - 909.00] P:1391.95 E:0.086744 |  we're going to get a touch on that, it bounces away on the right hand side, son of the great George,
[909.00 - 914.00] P:1540.34 E:0.091381 |  it bounces back to Harry Maguire and he passes it forward to Harry Kane,
[914.00 - 919.00] P:1450.65 E:0.088204 |  and now Saka near the centre circle back to Bellingham, Bellingham to the left hand side,
[919.00 - 927.00] P:1478.16 E:0.080509 |  and Shaw is there, just plays it close quarters to Declan Rice, and England will start again.
[927.00 - 932.00] P:1470.90 E:0.098625 |  England absolutely dominating the possession, it's only down on our screen, it's 58%,
[932.00 - 939.00] P:1641.16 E:0.094202 |  it feels like at least 10% more than that. Saka to Shaw, and then into the penalty area to Sterling,
[939.00 - 944.00] P:1530.90 E:0.087469 |  Sterling then back to Luke Shaw, the two of them just outside the left corner of the penalty area,
[944.00 - 947.00] P:1647.80 E:0.091598 |  right footed ball into the penalty area, but straight through to Goalkeeper Turner,
[947.00 - 950.00] P:1640.42 E:0.099543 |  ball in orange, who's able to scoop it up and underarm it out,
[950.00 - 956.00] P:1659.77 E:0.094878 |  and Anthony Robinson is able to bring it forward for the USA, and give it to the left hand side,
[956.00 - 962.00] P:1639.42 E:0.087376 |  and now it is Pulasik of Chelsea, Pulasik beginning to cut in from the left and uses his right foot
[962.00 - 967.00] P:1611.98 E:0.081712 |  to find McKenney with the red, white and blue stripe on his hair, and in comes the cross,
[967.00 - 972.00] P:1682.66 E:0.100860 |  and the header is wide from right from the clean yards out, there's a defender with him,
[972.00 - 975.00] P:1651.00 E:0.102409 |  and he steered it wide, openly opposed by two or three yards.
[975.00 - 982.00] P:1643.85 E:0.084825 |  Thrive's on the crosses, right up front, the USA, there's an opportunity there for Pulasik to swing it in,
[982.00 - 986.00] P:1566.05 E:0.093659 |  and it was 1v1 with McGuire, and he had a yard of space at the far post,
[986.00 - 991.00] P:1688.54 E:0.088976 |  and that was the opportunity by the time the ball got cycled out to the right hand side,
[991.00 - 995.00] P:1601.30 E:0.080828 |  England were better set, the ball was shorter than the near post,
[995.00 - 999.00] P:1433.01 E:0.076942 |  a really difficult header to purchase the angle to get any power,
[999.00 - 1001.00] P:1472.18 E:0.080081 |  Chance really missed there for America.
[1001.00 - 1010.00] P:1515.65 E:0.083128 |  Producer Gary's just found another source that suggests that England's possession is 65.2%.
[1010.00 - 1011.00] P:1466.91 E:0.081096 |  Sounds accurate.
[1011.00 - 1018.00] P:1512.53 E:0.098839 |  Yeah, it sounds more like it. So that's 65.2%, the one which is presumably FIFA approved says 58%,
[1018.00 - 1025.00] P:1366.43 E:0.096462 |  which as I always say with these things, Rob, it depends on the human who's putting that information in there.
[1025.00 - 1029.00] P:1510.17 E:0.087367 |  Well, but sometimes people think, well, it's written down, it's actually right.
[1029.00 - 1032.00] P:1543.23 E:0.096818 |  Small detail, but it's the possession control.
[1032.00 - 1033.00] P:1701.17 E:0.114154 |  The possession control.
[1033.00 - 1038.00] P:1587.26 E:0.104781 |  That's a good point, Rob, yeah, but I've actually read it properly, I would have spotted that.
[1038.00 - 1039.00] P:1573.01 E:0.082256 |  What does that mean?
[1039.00 - 1043.00] P:1500.60 E:0.099640 |  There's a contested possession area as well.
[1043.00 - 1050.00] P:1325.42 E:0.088465 |  So we're up to 87% overall, so my math says 13% contested.
[1050.00 - 1056.00] P:1384.46 E:0.091406 |  So when Harry McGuire had possession but was not in control, that wouldn't count, would it?
[1056.00 - 1060.00] P:1531.16 E:0.081515 |  Some might argue when Harry McGuire has it in control, he'll stop.
[1060.00 - 1062.00] P:1382.86 E:0.052317 |  Spikey.
[1062.00 - 1064.00] P:1488.03 E:0.071321 |  Not me.
[1064.00 - 1067.00] P:1352.06 E:0.087242 |  England 0, USA 0, and tonight as well, winning his 50th.
[1068.00 - 1072.00] P:1427.94 E:0.101835 |  He has Pickford passing it out from the back to Stoves.
[1072.00 - 1078.00] P:1509.86 E:0.078646 |  17 minutes on the clock, big chance for Harry Kane, but excellent defending actually from Zimmerman,
[1078.00 - 1082.00] P:1247.52 E:0.086164 |  Walker Zimmerman, he could only be playing for the United States, couldn't he?
[1082.00 - 1091.00] P:1425.49 E:0.075604 |  Here's Stoves, again out to McGuire over there in the orange boot, who turns and gives it back to Pickford again.
[1091.00 - 1095.00] P:1655.60 E:0.099443 |  So Jordan Pickford, you could tell he was really frustrated to have conceded two goals.
[1095.00 - 1099.00] P:1564.40 E:0.101331 |  In fact England were, I've spoken to Garry Southgate a couple of times since the match,
[1099.00 - 1106.00] P:1574.42 E:0.095647 |  and also heard him in his conference, every time he spoke, Garry Southgate talked about the conceding of those two goals.
[1106.00 - 1110.00] P:1407.37 E:0.094657 |  I think the ideal scenario tonight for England obviously would be to win the game.
[1110.00 - 1112.00] P:1456.33 E:0.097491 |  I think he would absolutely love a clean sheet.
[1112.00 - 1120.00] P:1520.43 E:0.082657 |  The ball's played back to Stones again, and Stones, Rice makes himself available.
[1120.00 - 1124.00] P:1480.10 E:0.084777 |  On the other side of Hadji Wright, oh and that's a poor touch from Trippio,
[1124.00 - 1128.00] P:1667.27 E:0.091756 |  tried to open his body, received the pass from Dalligan, he actually missed it,
[1128.00 - 1135.00] P:1474.91 E:0.085208 |  and just skinned off his shin out of play for a throwing to the USA 10 yards inside the England half.
[1135.00 - 1142.00] P:1474.66 E:0.082054 |  Anthony Robinson down there, Jedi as they call him, is going to take this throw, just inching forward,
[1142.00 - 1149.00] P:1397.34 E:0.089144 |  and then it's headed infield by Poolecic, but into the body of McGuire, who's able to control and play it up onto the chest of Harry Kane,
[1149.00 - 1154.00] P:1636.84 E:0.089383 |  who takes that down and waits for the challenge to come in from Tyler Adams, but Kane is strong,
[1154.00 - 1159.00] P:1480.61 E:0.082626 |  and now to the right hand side, Saka back to Bellingham, Bellingham with a shimmy,
[1159.00 - 1163.00] P:1671.73 E:0.099488 |  is challenged strong and hard and good as well, and the USA have got it back,
[1163.00 - 1169.00] P:1639.20 E:0.087744 |  they've dispossessed Jude Bellingham and Poolecic, then finds the pass infield to Eunice Musa,
[1169.00 - 1172.00] P:1658.82 E:0.105315 |  who it was who won the ball back from Bellingham, that's a marker,
[1172.00 - 1176.00] P:1629.05 E:0.096257 |  and now it's been taken forward down the right hand side, but it breaks down on the edge of the England penalty area.
[1176.00 - 1183.00] P:1520.64 E:0.089066 |  However, Musa is there, the teenager, and he'll feel good, he's not really been in the game until now,
[1183.00 - 1189.00] P:1529.04 E:0.092275 |  but Poolecic now just outside the penalty area, nice turn on the right hand side by Weyer, out to the right.
[1189.00 - 1196.00] P:1727.28 E:0.097050 |  Here's the cross into the England six yard box from Dest, but Pickford was able to smartly make ground to his right,
[1196.00 - 1198.00] P:1502.95 E:0.076874 |  backpedaling as well and caught it.
[1198.00 - 1205.00] P:1605.56 E:0.079884 |  Yeah, good moments for America, and two moments there for such a new death, really, really poor to end it off.
[1205.00 - 1210.00] P:1581.65 E:0.069722 |  One was the initial ball in, it got cut out, and it was a try to be a cut back to no one in particular,
[1210.00 - 1215.00] P:1470.24 E:0.088767 |  and then the cross was even worse, it just floated across to the harbour, far post,
[1215.00 - 1221.00] P:1377.13 E:0.080425 |  and Pickford will be pleased to get a touch with the ball in a gather, but lighter moments, better moments,
[1221.00 - 1225.00] P:1347.93 E:0.077381 |  exciting moments for America, just that quality hitting them down.
[1225.00 - 1231.00] P:1193.19 E:0.090155 |  England nil, USA nil, five live and BBC sounds live from Qatar,
[1231.00 - 1238.00] P:1134.82 E:0.093271 |  and as I say, really we're in Alcor tonight, and England playing with McGuire into the centre-circle,
[1238.00 - 1244.00] P:1511.31 E:0.097962 |  to Balingham who's just overrun that, just bounced away from him, so Poolecic receives it back in the centre-circle,
[1244.00 - 1253.00] P:1476.86 E:0.094981 |  right-footed ball over the top, McGuire will allow that bounce through to Pickford, again, who's come out and safely holds onto the bouncing ball.
[1253.00 - 1255.00] P:1535.75 E:0.090432 |  Twenty minutes played, and it's still goalless.
[1255.00 - 1261.00] P:1357.27 E:0.085054 |  Here's Saka, Saka on the right, but his pass is intercepted by Rean, but then Saka is able to get there,
[1261.00 - 1268.00] P:1179.21 E:0.093554 |  and England have it back again inside their own half, just in front of where Greg, their halter is standing,
[1268.00 - 1279.00] P:1174.09 E:0.099479 |  their halter, their headed, with his grey T-shirt on, Rice, and now back to Stokes, the drum, you can hear the rhythm,
[1279.00 - 1286.00] P:1087.93 E:0.096977 |  there's someone dressed as a Yankee soldier, I noticed right in the front row of the US section, the main US section,
[1286.00 - 1292.00] P:1032.22 E:0.093743 |  he's got a big civil war style drum as well with him, and that I assume is what you can hear.
[1292.00 - 1301.00] P:1151.46 E:0.086814 |  England with McGuire then goes back to Stones, and Stones uses Declan Rice, who just moves to the right, and passes it to Trippian.
[1301.00 - 1306.00] P:1168.29 E:0.090403 |  Trippian takes a touch, and then England go back to Rice again, nil nil.
[1306.00 - 1313.00] P:1199.44 E:0.091988 |  James Madison is here by the way, but has not yet started training with England, but I got the impression from Garis Southgate
[1313.00 - 1320.00] P:1313.50 E:0.088867 |  that there might be news on that after this game, maybe in the next couple of days that Madison might be able to join England training.
[1320.00 - 1327.00] P:1496.67 E:0.086682 |  Back it comes into central defence, Kyle Walker and Calvin Phillips on the bench again, England naming an unchanged site tonight,
[1327.00 - 1333.00] P:1423.64 E:0.086382 |  if you haven't heard incidentally for the first time since the World Cup semi-final of four and a half years ago,
[1333.00 - 1345.00] P:1435.80 E:0.084651 |  he has Mount on the right flank, Mount plays it in field, but it's Tyler Adams to put it out of play, and here in Trippian will take this.
[1345.00 - 1354.00] P:1501.99 E:0.093858 |  Lovely night again, temperature wise here, even though it was sultry outside, it just feels right for football inside with the air conditioning.
[1354.00 - 1362.00] P:1581.93 E:0.091918 |  Yeah, really good atmosphere, and it just feels... just watching the game and the players passing the ball and looking at the state of the pitch in the centre circle,
[1362.00 - 1371.00] P:1471.17 E:0.095926 |  it looks great, it also seems, judging by how the players are passing the ball, really, really hard and slightly difficult to control.
[1371.00 - 1378.00] P:1425.37 E:0.089736 |  You've seen a lot of players mis-touch, misplace passes, not in terms of they've lost it and it's a horrendous pass or anything like that,
[1378.00 - 1382.00] P:1476.57 E:0.091179 |  it just seems a little bit harder to control and a little bit faster than they used to.
[1382.00 - 1389.00] P:1542.76 E:0.099980 |  Bellingham playing it to Trippian on the right-hand side, lovely change of feet to take it away from Robinson, but then Moosa again in with a challenge, impressive.
[1389.00 - 1395.00] P:1524.37 E:0.090960 |  Again, big challenge on Bellingham, now big challenge on Trippian, but England played out to the left-hand side,
[1395.00 - 1401.00] P:1631.13 E:0.096877 |  Sterling's got that down nicely in the full-back position and he's running at test, and he's into the penalty area, and it bounces right across the box,
[1401.00 - 1408.00] P:1426.16 E:0.084237 |  but it's cleared away by Reem, comes out to Declan Rice though, good to see that from Sterling having a goal, running out the defender.
[1408.00 - 1414.00] P:1465.14 E:0.080139 |  Well, the switch was on, said before, the switch is on and that was a fantastic ball out, I mean a wonderful touch to set him off.
[1414.00 - 1421.00] P:1310.19 E:0.090593 |  England with it in the centre-circle, Stolz goes for a long pass looking for Saka, he bumps into Robinson,
[1421.00 - 1426.00] P:1484.38 E:0.098456 |  but it is the Arsenal man who I think will struggle to keep it in, yes, he tried to put his foot on the ball and slipped over,
[1426.00 - 1430.00] P:1379.49 E:0.092786 |  maybe on that hard surface he's talking about, took him off the field and the ball's out for a throw.
[1430.00 - 1435.00] P:1463.06 E:0.094514 |  Yeah, just a heavy touch and it's just skipped away from him and he just can't catch it up, it's skipped as well.
[1435.00 - 1443.00] P:1293.34 E:0.099540 |  Another thing I know, Sonny's, there's barely any shadows of the players, it is brilliant, literally brilliant from every angle here.
[1443.00 - 1451.00] P:1500.55 E:0.099325 |  It is, they talk about the looks, don't they? The looks number tells you how bright it is.
[1451.00 - 1459.00] P:1398.98 E:0.087082 |  There's one stat we don't have, which is the United States though, so you would expect it to be that heavy tonight.
[1459.00 - 1467.00] P:1375.58 E:0.085107 |  England nil, USA nil and Dest playing the ball back to goalkeeper Turner.
[1467.00 - 1476.00] P:1442.81 E:0.094666 |  Dest, who is on loan at AC Milan, boss Lonerman, was making great strides, but he's one of the youngsters 22 years old
[1476.00 - 1482.00] P:1560.25 E:0.093449 |  and Fuller-Sekers claiming that he was pulled back there by Trippia, wanted the free kick, referee allows it to go,
[1482.00 - 1487.00] P:1432.05 E:0.092781 |  McKenney now taking it on towards the edge of the England penalty area, forced out wide by Rice Heads,
[1487.00 - 1495.00] P:1366.42 E:0.085561 |  where, where now, angles it back, Tyler Adams is there, Adams to his right to Dest and now McKenney is there as well,
[1495.00 - 1502.00] P:1503.43 E:0.084501 |  pulls the ball onto his right foot, this is in the England left back position, Sterling is back defending, helping out Shaw,
[1502.00 - 1508.00] P:1563.35 E:0.088997 |  but it comes in to Moosa on the edge of the box, he takes it on, gives it to Dest on the right hand side, Dest works it back,
[1508.00 - 1515.00] P:1577.00 E:0.102511 |  where is there on the right, where's Ball in and in the middle McKenney goes into the box and on the right foot,
[1515.00 - 1522.00] P:1665.31 E:0.096098 |  that was a great chance, eight yards out, he looked to whip it in and he whipped it over the top.
[1522.00 - 1528.00] P:1696.16 E:0.101550 |  That's a brilliant way of work move for a brilliant chance, McKenney completely unmarked at the far post,
[1528.00 - 1534.00] P:1640.80 E:0.100678 |  Sackers no idea of where he is, I think he just comes around a couple of bodies and skips up in front of him,
[1534.00 - 1539.00] P:1488.45 E:0.103195 |  that hard surface that we're talking about, catching him out there because he didn't have the control that it needed,
[1539.00 - 1546.00] P:1311.58 E:0.100084 |  but England couldn't get the pressure out wide, couldn't block the cross, it was well worked by America, good possession,
[1546.00 - 1555.00] P:1491.63 E:0.090887 |  well executed up until the finish. They'll feel better about it after that, the United States, that was really promising from them,
[1555.00 - 1561.00] P:1619.19 E:0.097550 |  that was like some of the stuff they played in the first half against Wales, as the ball is out of play,
[1561.00 - 1566.00] P:1518.70 E:0.103026 |  I thought that might have been a foul for the challenge on Robinson by Sacker, but it's not giving us a free kick,
[1566.00 - 1572.00] P:1494.48 E:0.095909 |  it's giving us a throw to it. No, it's good composure from America, that's what we haven't seen yet, that bit of composure on the ball,
[1572.00 - 1579.00] P:1462.62 E:0.087878 |  there's real moments of energy when they break and when they get through, break through the line, but that showed control for composure
[1579.00 - 1586.00] P:1327.54 E:0.082516 |  and a picking of the right ball. England nil, United States nil, five-live at the World Cup here in Qatar,
[1586.00 - 1592.00] P:1589.12 E:0.094964 |  and Dest taking the ball down in his right back position, turning it away and getting the throw in off Luke Shaw,
[1592.00 - 1598.00] P:1569.91 E:0.095188 |  United States having been in the greatest form in terms of results, coming into the tournament,
[1598.00 - 1604.00] P:1321.67 E:0.096339 |  and then of course an opening draw, so that means they've won just one of their last six internationals,
[1604.00 - 1612.00] P:1259.13 E:0.090633 |  that England have won one of their last seven, there's good win though.
[1612.00 - 1613.00] P:1410.79 E:0.071335 |  Evenly matched.
[1613.00 - 1619.00] P:1409.41 E:0.102129 |  Yeah, ball bouncing in the centre-circle, might have been a little push there, there was, well spotted by the referee,
[1619.00 - 1624.00] P:1659.42 E:0.099452 |  who's from Venezuela incidentally, and it is a free kick to the United States, good decision,
[1624.00 - 1631.00] P:1470.35 E:0.094938 |  the push by Trippie, it's a free kick to the USA, his name by the way is Jesus Valenzuela from Venezuela.
[1631.00 - 1641.00] P:1359.94 E:0.084578 |  Easy to remember, it was a good decision, but it broke then, and Robinson felt like the ball through to right in the centre-ball position,
[1641.00 - 1648.00] P:1381.75 E:0.087250 |  he was on the shoulder of John Stones, he felt like he was away, so maybe a fraction fortunate for England that advantage wasn't played.
[1648.00 - 1657.00] P:1292.89 E:0.095035 |  England nil, USA nil, and on the subject of referees, you might have been wondering, like I was, Michael Oliver has now been given his first game,
[1657.00 - 1668.00] P:1427.40 E:0.087310 |  and he will referee Japan Costa Rica on Sunday, so the first match for the Michael Oliver, Simon Bennett, Stuart Burt team, Japan Costa Rica.
[1668.00 - 1677.00] P:1362.95 E:0.093718 |  USA with it on the right hand side, carrying the ball into England territory, and Kenny who had that really glorious opportunity
[1677.00 - 1684.00] P:1474.94 E:0.091636 |  a few moments ago, plays it square, Pulasik uses Robinson on the left hand side pushing forward, as they like him to do in this team.
[1684.00 - 1691.00] P:1531.44 E:0.087277 |  McKenney back to Robinson again, couple of touches, foot to foot, works it back to Moussa, and he's got to have a go right foot it,
[1691.00 - 1700.00] P:1684.74 E:0.095470 |  it's deflected down into the ground, but it whipped through, and it sort of grows up like a jet taking off, but straight at Pickford who was able to hold the ball into his chest.
[1700.00 - 1711.00] P:1543.96 E:0.090330 |  Yeah, it's good from Declan Liles getting out fast, getting out, getting the block, not full block, but took the sting out of it, it's a spinning ball, a fast bounce, but comfortably dealt with.
[1711.00 - 1718.00] P:1490.82 E:0.103605 |  I thought from Trippie, the ball was bouncing up, but Moussa came across and had a look and deflected it out of play.
[1718.00 - 1723.00] P:1406.90 E:0.099949 |  Moussa's really caught my eye, 19 years old, 20 later this month.
[1723.00 - 1732.00] P:1432.24 E:0.096164 |  The old three in the sentiment for what they're really good at is that they play with their heads up, and they look for passes, but at the same time, if they wait, if he goes back off or hold off, they drive.
[1732.00 - 1743.00] P:1530.24 E:0.094524 |  Nice little piece about Moussa on the BBC Sport website at the moment, ball clad in to Mount inside the penalty area, but Dex put in the challenge, and it bounces through to Turner.
[1743.00 - 1751.00] P:1602.83 E:0.087614 |  I'll look at that on the football pages at the BBC Sport website, our colleague Alex Howell went to Valencia, his club, to speak to him.
[1751.00 - 1757.00] P:1397.83 E:0.091496 |  Former captain of the Arsenal youth teams, who's at the Arsenal Academy, could have played for England.
[1757.00 - 1763.00] P:1382.78 E:0.087584 |  Tyler Adams, Eunice Moussa, could have played for Ghana, could have played for Italy.
[1763.00 - 1769.00] P:1423.97 E:0.103137 |  Should mention as well, of course, Anthony Robinson, born in Milton Keynes, the United States left back.
[1769.00 - 1774.00] P:1384.40 E:0.095910 |  England dropping onto the back foot because USA are in possession.
[1774.00 - 1781.00] P:1370.68 E:0.094964 |  Almost half an hour played now, England 0, USA 0, both teams with one really good chance.
[1781.00 - 1791.00] P:1547.16 E:0.098397 |  Looking at USA coming into the game now, looking a lot more confident on the ball, stroking it around, biding the time, much like England were at the opening section of the game.
[1791.00 - 1794.00] P:1489.90 E:0.099958 |  So you'd have to say, very evenly balanced at the moment.
[1794.00 - 1803.00] P:1569.98 E:0.100011 |  Frank from Poulousek, and then Moussa is second, tumbling as the challenge came in, it's a combination of Bellingham and Stones.
[1803.00 - 1813.00] P:1378.26 E:0.091978 |  And Moussa, as I say, went cartwheeling away across the surface of the pitch, and he was just caught by Stones, who put his foot in on the ball, free kick.
[1813.00 - 1820.00] P:1536.44 E:0.093911 |  Yeah, a fraction late, but he also knew that he was caught out of position because he was pressing into the area in front of him, into the area of the cinema.
[1820.00 - 1824.00] P:1431.45 E:0.080138 |  It's a long way back for him then, he's not going to get all the way back in.
[1824.00 - 1832.00] P:1491.50 E:0.079258 |  Well, I think we can say Rob, England are in a proper World Cup match today, after the extenuating circumstances.
[1832.00 - 1838.00] P:1320.21 E:0.080786 |  But, I mean, it ran with everything that was going on, they were the ideal opponents.
[1838.00 - 1844.00] P:1391.55 E:0.090993 |  Looking back at hindsight, knowing what we do now, the way that the match developed, the way the players were, they were clearly affected.
[1844.00 - 1850.00] P:1307.77 E:0.089538 |  And certainly having seen them play against Wales today, when it seemed as though things really lifted off their shoulders.
[1850.00 - 1854.00] P:1432.61 E:0.079236 |  But for England, the perfect opening opponents, but this is the real thing.
[1854.00 - 1862.00] P:1626.67 E:0.088070 |  Yeah, and what you would say is that America may have learnt the lesson from the first game, having spent all that energy in the first half.
[1862.00 - 1867.00] P:1497.04 E:0.098554 |  And now we've got Adams and Mount Tanglen on the half-wheel line.
[1867.00 - 1873.00] P:1527.09 E:0.087389 |  It was a bouncing ball between the two of them, it was flicked up into the body of McKenney.
[1873.00 - 1877.00] P:1331.60 E:0.082846 |  And then in the end, it's given us an England free kick.
[1877.00 - 1884.00] P:1429.07 E:0.097960 |  I think McKenney just caught him out with an arm across the top of the body and then the face, not really any intent in it.
[1884.00 - 1885.00] P:1593.92 E:0.094028 |  So just a free kick.
[1885.00 - 1889.00] P:1316.20 E:0.099321 |  Trippier on the right-hand side, Trippier curls it into the box, but that is headed up and away by Zimmerman.
[1889.00 - 1894.00] P:1273.29 E:0.091403 |  England take-up possession again, but Trippier plays it a little way behind John Stones.
[1895.00 - 1900.00] P:1263.78 E:0.099866 |  And so McGuire, a heavy touch from McGuire, very nearly presented it to Pooleysick.
[1900.00 - 1905.00] P:1339.35 E:0.088959 |  He had to be sharp there, McGuire, to actually get to the ball ahead of Pooleysick.
[1905.00 - 1911.00] P:1234.44 E:0.093905 |  So instead, they go all the way back to Pickford again. Long pass from Pickford, and Dest is up high above Stirling.
[1911.00 - 1914.00] P:1587.45 E:0.085207 |  It's hooked forward, stretch from Rice.
[1914.00 - 1920.00] P:1523.84 E:0.101331 |  Mount had to come and help, but he did. It bounces away. McKenney, though, nice turn, used his body to get away from Mount.
[1920.00 - 1926.00] P:1533.41 E:0.098552 |  And McKenney surges forward to the edge of the England penalty area, into the box now on the right-hand side, back onto his left foot.
[1926.00 - 1929.00] P:1536.16 E:0.094942 |  Plays it to Moosa on the edge of the area. Moosa across to Pooleysick.
[1929.00 - 1933.00] P:1562.14 E:0.099003 |  England defenders getting back. Pooleysick shoots and hits the bar.
[1933.00 - 1941.00] P:1638.24 E:0.102561 |  Pickford diving to his right, and it strikes the top of the bar and looks away at a crazy angle over to the far side and behind foot.
[1941.00 - 1946.00] P:1644.35 E:0.102292 |  What is a goal kick at the United States? The width of the crossbar from taking the lead.
[1946.00 - 1950.00] P:1636.19 E:0.097351 |  It's a fantastic strike from Pooleysick on his weaker foot.
[1950.00 - 1953.00] P:1548.98 E:0.100937 |  Get a trip here on Moosa. Go on then, from that angle.
[1953.00 - 1956.00] P:1482.08 E:0.105080 |  Back and put McGowley, back me on the angle.
[1956.00 - 1963.00] P:1422.43 E:0.088885 |  Wow, it nearly came off. It's dipping. It's got everything on it. Just not enough.
[1963.00 - 1966.00] P:1329.72 E:0.088720 |  Juliet Farrington is down pitch side behind that goal.
[1966.00 - 1971.00] P:1454.35 E:0.094514 |  Yeah, Jordan Pickford, far from happy. Getting in his way, getting in that wrap.
[1971.00 - 1978.00] P:1618.71 E:0.096300 |  John Stones, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Luke Shaw in particular, and McGuire have been on the receiving end of Pickford's noise.
[1978.00 - 1987.00] P:1581.72 E:0.088377 |  He has been barking at those players, and Declan Rice as well in this last 10 minutes or so, as the Americans certainly put on the pressure down this end.
[1987.00 - 1992.00] P:1606.50 E:0.088438 |  Harry Kane wins a free kick as England fired it away down the middle.
[1992.00 - 1994.00] P:1400.43 E:0.081079 |  Not sure how much there was in that.
[1994.00 - 1999.00] P:1468.83 E:0.090893 |  Zimmerman just putting his hip into Kane who went to the ground, and the referee said free kick.
[1999.00 - 2003.00] P:1511.19 E:0.088766 |  So it's almost in the middle of the USA half.
[2003.00 - 2009.00] P:1453.94 E:0.087891 |  Yeah, there was no effort from Zimmerman to play the ball. I think that was the key part that Kane was up in the air.
[2009.00 - 2016.00] P:1433.15 E:0.079809 |  He took him out, and it was more the contact with the ground on the hip for Harry Kane. That was the painful part.
[2016.00 - 2027.00] P:1300.27 E:0.093088 |  The other thing about the pitch, Rob, I'm reliably informed by people who were here yesterday that they were actually colouring the pitch yesterday to make it look more green.
[2027.00 - 2029.00] P:1223.45 E:0.085675 |  Tank the sand green.
[2029.00 - 2038.00] P:1394.33 E:0.099298 |  That's your speciality of course, green. Free kick, middle of the half. Shaw receives it, puts his foot on the ball.
[2038.00 - 2049.00] P:1621.82 E:0.086187 |  It's played into the penalty area in the back post. McGuire heads it across, but Dest stretched, and the USA do clear it away to Luke Shaw on the half-way line.
[2049.00 - 2051.00] P:1439.04 E:0.087254 |  And England will start again.
[2051.00 - 2063.00] P:1260.43 E:0.080796 |  0-0. Ten minutes to go to the break. We'll hear from Michael Richards again. Kelly's here with us tonight. Kelly Case presenting the program from inside the stadium with us.
[2063.00 - 2068.00] P:1156.98 E:0.087251 |  And Rice takes up possession inside his own half.
[2068.00 - 2073.00] P:1218.95 E:0.101247 |  Mark Chapman's in the stadium tonight as well. They're very rarely seen inside the same football stadium together.
[2073.00 - 2081.00] P:1473.57 E:0.089404 |  Mark Chapman and Kelly Case. It's a real red letter day in the old date as McGuire will take it forward.
[2081.00 - 2088.00] P:1410.78 E:0.083283 |  And it's all the way back to Pickford. Mark Chapman on TV duties tonight, so looking a million dollars.
[2088.00 - 2091.00] P:1517.13 E:0.084695 |  We are all honoured.
[2091.00 - 2100.00] P:1588.37 E:0.080054 |  Here's Stones. Stones turns and shuffles the ball forward. Highlights on BBC One 11.30 tonight.
[2100.00 - 2107.00] P:1416.98 E:0.086736 |  And the USA also watched them on the iPlayer. Jermaine Genus and Ashley Williams with Mark.
[2107.00 - 2115.00] P:1311.24 E:0.090357 |  Here's McGuire out to the left-hand side to Shaw. And then back it comes to McGuire in the middle of the England half.
[2115.00 - 2118.00] P:1371.66 E:0.090259 |  There's not been much in it. It's been quite an even game.
[2118.00 - 2126.00] P:1342.25 E:0.095429 |  Dalligan back down to Rice. Rice to the left-hand side. Shaw. Mount makes a run down the left-hand side. Shaw will take it on now.
[2126.00 - 2131.00] P:1484.04 E:0.096611 |  There are options either side. He uses Mount. Mount whips it in right footed. Dalligan with a flick.
[2131.00 - 2136.00] P:1560.31 E:0.095073 |  It was blocked by Zimmerman. Still in the USA panel of the area. Sterling trying to get it down. Shaw in the box.
[2136.00 - 2144.00] P:1668.91 E:0.091426 |  Turns, stabs it back to Mount on the edge of the area. Mount flips it in. But it's caught by Turner who's able to come and catch.
[2144.00 - 2151.00] P:1673.54 E:0.101592 |  And then he gets rid of it quickly. He's looking for the racing. Tulisig. And Stones is able to come across and times that beautifully.
[2151.00 - 2156.00] P:1659.92 E:0.095779 |  He's headed out of play and Tulisig vigorously claps back towards Turner.
[2156.00 - 2164.00] P:1463.96 E:0.081926 |  Right, so fantastic ball. Fantastic ball from the goalkeeper. Into the path of Tulisig. Cleverly read. Well read by John Stones.
[2164.00 - 2172.00] P:1434.51 E:0.086128 |  But I think that's better from England just to control the game. Kill it. Pick the time to go and play. Pick the time to attack.
[2172.00 - 2178.00] P:1358.36 E:0.086051 |  You don't want to get into a frenetic, chaotic game with this American side. Because that's what they thrive on. That's their game.
[2178.00 - 2185.00] P:1216.13 E:0.074343 |  England nil. USA nil. Here is Musa.
[2185.00 - 2194.00] P:1585.73 E:0.097174 |  Eunice Musa plays the ball forward but advances back. That is like a clear tug by Mount in the central third of the field on Weyer.
[2194.00 - 2202.00] P:1505.90 E:0.098984 |  No free kick. The referee's played advantage there again. Weyer gets on his feet. Rather nimbly plays it out to the left hand side.
[2202.00 - 2209.00] P:1476.19 E:0.091074 |  Robinson in field. American confidence is growing here. And the referee spotted a handball as it bounced up into Tulisig.
[2209.00 - 2217.00] P:1482.04 E:0.090035 |  And it's a free kick to England. Yeah, well spotted. Just an opportunity. England slow it down because for 20 minutes you thought,
[2217.00 - 2224.00] P:1534.61 E:0.085169 |  well, this could be a case of England taking the lead and just growing in confidence. But since then, America have grown into the game.
[2224.00 - 2233.00] P:1463.51 E:0.075938 |  And really, it looked like the more likely, without, yes, they hit the crossbar. But never got round the back of England as such.
[2233.00 - 2237.00] P:1734.73 E:0.095899 |  But it do look more likely, they're more confident right now.
[2237.00 - 2246.00] P:1510.60 E:0.086349 |  Sure, there's under pressure, miscontrolled it out of play. USA take the throw. McGuire's able to head it away, gets it back and then thumps it away.
[2246.00 - 2254.00] P:1389.46 E:0.094061 |  McKenney takes that down, plays it in field. Good play from McKenney. Now it's Adams. Adams. Busy little figure as we know.
[2254.00 - 2261.00] P:1495.23 E:0.095376 |  Leeds United support us, of course, know this season in that central midfield. When things have gone well for Leeds this season under Jesse Marsh,
[2261.00 - 2267.00] P:1477.34 E:0.092373 |  he's usually had a very good game out of play for a throw on the right hand side. Dest to take this.
[2267.00 - 2282.00] P:1483.78 E:0.090216 |  So, Genio. Dest, the Dutch born Dest just leaves the ball and McKenney's actually, he's leaned over the hoardings and he's wiping his hands on the bit of a photographer,
[2282.00 - 2291.00] P:1542.82 E:0.081757 |  dry his hands. I think I've never seen that before. The photographer looked very amazed. Throw from McKenney then and McGuire got up but didn't get a clean head on it.
[2291.00 - 2304.00] P:1638.89 E:0.086146 |  It's still bouncing in play and it is right. Had you right against Stones and as he tried to turn him, Stones got a foot in to stab it behind for a corner to USA for their first.
[2304.00 - 2316.00] P:1594.21 E:0.096715 |  Yeah, unnecessary that. John Stones had the header. It was a standing header but one that was going to win and Aaron McGuire coming in trying to take charge and just confuse the situation on corner which was avoidable.
[2316.00 - 2338.00] P:1590.22 E:0.093020 |  Yeah, so now England having to defend a corner. So, best behaviour everyone. USA corner. Swing into the near post but McGuire gets up and is able, really unchallenged, to head that away to comparative safety and then they're all over still in combination with Dest and Robinson and it's a free kick to England half inside their own half.
[2338.00 - 2350.00] P:1558.26 E:0.078427 |  So, half a few chances really when you look at it and I think the USA have had more opportunities. England had the first clear on that. The fact to chop from Ken which was very good.
[2350.00 - 2361.00] P:1533.83 E:0.083333 |  Yeah, 4-3 so they hesitate to call them the official statistics but an asset of statistics says 4-3. In fact, they're the BBC statistics so they must be right Rob.
[2361.00 - 2362.00] P:1510.03 E:0.067838 |  Absolutely.
[2391.00 - 2410.00] P:1541.63 E:0.094911 |  Yes, local thought. Kane knew that McKenney was coming and when it comes to challenge on him from Adams and Mount infield that's a good ball. Nicely done by Saka, takes it away from Adams. Saka then plays it to the far side but played that beyond Bellingham and that meant that Ware was onto the ball again, gets his head down but Bellingham glides across.
[2410.00 - 2421.00] P:1540.96 E:0.104401 |  Amazing how he got there so quickly but out really seeming to have put on a sprint and it bounces out of play which has been disputed by Bellingham who feels it should have been an England throw but it's a USA throw.
[2421.00 - 2437.00] P:1415.45 E:0.088066 |  Yeah, it was a good opening for England and you just felt that the switch was on, everyone could see it apart from the man on the ball but Kaya Saka eventually saw it and then played a really poor ball out and the opportunity was wasted but in England do have it under control.
[2437.00 - 2438.00] P:1514.28 E:0.092985 |  They can play through.
[2438.00 - 2453.00] P:1640.41 E:0.103549 |  Yeah, but this is good from the United States. Back heel sets, desks away and desks into the penalty area, beats McGuire and shoots and it's deflected right across the face of goal and out towards the corner flag where it eventually rolls out of play but it is a corner to USA, good play desk.
[2453.00 - 2462.00] P:1584.08 E:0.091929 |  Yeah, England just aren't dealing with the direct running of America and it's coming from every angle. It's coming from the midfield, it's coming from the full backs, it's coming from the wingers.
[2462.00 - 2473.00] P:1693.54 E:0.094289 |  When they go direct England the backpedal and eventually there Harry McGuire was showing desks down the line, showing him wide, steps inside, he thought he was going to get a shot right, great block in the end.
[2473.00 - 2489.00] P:1664.43 E:0.090886 |  That's Rob Green with us on 5 Live here inside the Old Bate Stadium and it's a corner to the United States, it's halftime approaches and here it is, played into the edge of the six yard box right onto the head of Harry McGuire.
[2489.00 - 2500.00] P:1477.06 E:0.086762 |  I think we must have the effect from down on pitch side because that was a right splatch wasn't it, off the head of McGuire. You must have had a lot of perspiration on it.
[2500.00 - 2502.00] P:1399.57 E:0.080271 |  Yeah, I think the balls felt that.
[2502.00 - 2518.00] P:1361.61 E:0.088226 |  Hitted. Take that. Haya. As we've all got on our phones out here, the Haya app. Here is Zimmerman. Always makes me think of Miss Piggy whenever I press on it.
[2518.00 - 2520.00] P:1411.73 E:0.074961 |  I was thinking of Bat Pink.
[2520.00 - 2532.00] P:1596.25 E:0.085088 |  Yeah, well that shows. Our respective ages. Here is Ware, now to the right hand side. Right is out there. Stirling has come back so right gives it back to Dest.
[2532.00 - 2542.00] P:1723.42 E:0.096301 |  Foot on the ball. Dest's cross. Header down but a cross goal and wide by Pulisic. He was in there again, he's already struck the crossbar Pulisic.
[2542.00 - 2548.00] P:1684.38 E:0.100172 |  Now he's getting up for heados. Is this the same Pulisic that we've been watching for Chelsea?
[2548.00 - 2552.00] P:1713.39 E:0.106287 |  Well, at times for Chelsea, far between.
[2552.00 - 2560.00] P:1694.65 E:0.098306 |  But he's got the stars and stripes on now Rob. Captain America is actually off his shoulder. I think he's just slightly behind him so he's coming back onto it.
[2560.00 - 2568.00] P:1618.57 E:0.094155 |  He's timed it. Again down this right hand side. England is stepping off the stepping back. They're not putting the pressure on. They're not on the front foot.
[2568.00 - 2580.00] P:1579.61 E:0.082927 |  England 0, United States 0 and now United States having the better of it. I think Stuart Holden who we heard from before the game, from a United States international, played in the World Cup against Rob back in 2010.
[2580.00 - 2589.00] P:1615.27 E:0.085625 |  He came up and spoke to us, which I very much enjoyed at half time in the previous match as Stirling then plays it to Saka but that breaks down for England.
[2589.00 - 2596.00] P:1652.72 E:0.088636 |  They're not giving away though. Played away. Tripier back to Bellingham. It's a good time for England to score this after being under pressure.
[2596.00 - 2604.00] P:1721.23 E:0.100576 |  Shaw with the cross but Turner's going to be able to catch that quite comfortably. Even though Saka has arrived and King wasn't too far away and he overarms it out.
[2604.00 - 2617.00] P:1421.52 E:0.090656 |  And we've seen the American confidence grow as the half has continued and Stuart Holden when he sat down and was getting ready to talk to us, he said to me, right, here we go.
[2617.00 - 2624.00] P:1636.11 E:0.094545 |  Here's the Yankee Doodle Dandy to there. And he was. He was exactly that. He looked up to it, didn't he?
[2624.00 - 2626.00] P:1467.69 E:0.093216 |  Played to the character, played to the role, yeah.
[2626.00 - 2636.00] P:1264.40 E:0.081836 |  It was like Bob Hope, like, almost like that. Danny Kay, maybe. Here is Mount who plays it to the left-hand side.
[2636.00 - 2647.00] P:1349.06 E:0.089339 |  Now back to Declan Rice, who uses John Stones, Garos Southgate, again with the dark suit and the cream polo neck on underneath it, watching on.
[2647.00 - 2655.00] P:1598.28 E:0.094955 |  Saka in front of him, passes it forward to Bellingham and Bellingham whips it into the back post where Desk was able to set himself and headed away.
[2655.00 - 2662.00] P:1597.42 E:0.099610 |  A glance away but he's given it to Shaw and now Stirling and Shaw. Oh, Shaw's done superbly well. Puzzle back. Saka at the near post.
[2662.00 - 2667.00] P:1679.03 E:0.093444 |  Left foot lifts it high over the top, surrounded by Americans in blue shirts.
[2667.00 - 2673.00] P:1453.48 E:0.092825 |  Yeah, brilliant from the two flanks. Brilliant. And initially from Duke Bellingham with the cross.
[2673.00 - 2683.00] P:1576.11 E:0.099309 |  Harry Kane just didn't read it. He didn't think that Duke Bellingham would be able to put such a ball in. Then Luke Shaw driving in was just behind Saka.
[2683.00 - 2691.00] P:1396.65 E:0.082839 |  He couldn't get any control on the shot, high and wide. But again, England picking their moments, picking the time, creating the chances.
[2691.00 - 2701.00] P:1362.52 E:0.090942 |  Just when they show that bit of composure yesterday and that big FIFA conference, there were questions to Garos Southgate from the New Yorker, the Washington Post,
[2701.00 - 2714.00] P:1287.76 E:0.093416 |  Gold USA, Saka Waya and certainly the champ from Saka Waya, I think was looking for Garos Southgate maybe to see if he would diss the American game.
[2714.00 - 2721.00] P:1302.12 E:0.092021 |  But as you can imagine, Garos Southgate saw that coming from the mile off and his response was, he said,
[2721.00 - 2727.00] P:1375.47 E:0.090173 |  I'm not sure that England have ever beaten the United States in a major tournament. Have they?
[2727.00 - 2733.00] P:1688.60 E:0.104113 |  He said, I can tell you they haven't. Stirling through to the edge of the box. Shot from Mount, good save turn up.
[2733.00 - 2743.00] P:1636.83 E:0.104853 |  Down to his right. That was hit with real power from Mason Mount. Lovely combination on the edge of the box, but just too close to the keeper who was able to make a good stop.
[2743.00 - 2754.00] P:1541.62 E:0.097380 |  Now, Greg Stryke, Greg Saved, a lovely one touch, fast from Stirling. Probably a foot inside the post that gives Turner the chance to get down.
[2754.00 - 2765.00] P:1556.32 E:0.094577 |  It's too close to him. He can get down, he can cut his legs, which makes it that bit quicker, but because it's closer, it allows him to cut his legs and drop down quicker.
[2765.00 - 2775.00] P:1532.54 E:0.092109 |  He doesn't have to put the power into his right hand side. Good save though. Artistic from Turner, corner from the left for England.
[2775.00 - 2784.00] P:1709.46 E:0.096238 |  So it's going to be an in swing at. Here it comes into the six yard box. But it's an easy take for Turner again. He's had it in the good first half.
[2785.00 - 2794.00] P:1600.83 E:0.103444 |  Well, you know Rob, with your goalkeeping hat on. There's the halftime whistle, England nil. The United States nil, Turner turns and an applause to the United States.
[2794.00 - 2802.00] P:1461.00 E:0.092812 |  Fans just take too much for them to get excited and they're wildly waving their stars and stripes and they applaud again, whipping them up again.
[2802.00 - 2809.00] P:1357.82 E:0.091166 |  That's not necessarily something he needs to do, but he's had a good half and it is nil nil and the United States have had a good half.
[2809.00 - 2813.00] P:1663.05 E:0.090711 |  Yep, and they found their way into the game. They looked a little bit at all at sea at the start of the game.
[2813.00 - 2818.00] P:1875.78 E:0.087548 |  Weren't quite sure. They're in a different shape. 4-4-2, weren't getting the press right, weren't dropping right.
[2818.00 - 2825.00] P:1855.56 E:0.076956 |  England were in control. Then they started to find their way. They started to drive at England, which they struggled with.
[2825.00 - 2832.00] P:1903.98 E:0.071577 |  Had the best chances in there. Pulisic hit the crossbar. The Kenny going high and over went, really should have done better.
[2832.00 - 2839.00] P:1890.07 E:0.065770 |  But it's in the balance and England, they're going in. He's saying, look, we can play better than this. We are better than this.
[2839.00 - 2841.00] P:1848.94 E:0.061753 |  Go out and prove it.
[2841.00 - 2848.00] P:1827.26 E:0.076171 |  Yeah, McKenny had that big chance. Pulisic with a shot hit the crossbar, but England have had two big chances as well.
[2848.00 - 2854.00] P:1772.66 E:0.089575 |  I would say the early chance for Kane and that one there at the end, which was really powerfully hit and well saved by Turner.
[2855.00 - 2864.00] P:1856.79 E:0.064644 |  So, half time here, it is England nil, the United States nil and Kelly Cates is sitting just to my left.
[2864.00 - 2872.00] P:1754.85 E:0.102611 |  Thank you, John Murray. Rob, was it you in the car on the way here who said there's an element of leads about the way that the USA play?
[2872.00 - 2882.00] P:1705.63 E:0.090166 |  Just for people who are trying to picture them at home that does have that same energy and intensity, but also the leads that don't have Patrick Bamford available to them.
[2882.00 - 2894.00] P:1768.23 E:0.085629 |  There is that. I'm sure you'll be watching at home, but it's one that you're looking at how they play and the energy, but also the chaotichness of it that you're thinking, right, okay,
[2894.00 - 2904.00] P:1698.03 E:0.087221 |  well, where's this chance going to come from? Where's the composure going to come from? And it's not, it's just them going, I'm going to go and be really uncomfortable for England here.
[2904.00 - 2913.00] P:1677.57 E:0.089362 |  And it has been an uncomfortable half and it's one that England haven't quite, when they're on the front foot and they're stepping forwards and they look to dominate, they have.
[2913.00 - 2920.00] P:1538.58 E:0.085082 |  And then all of a sudden, if not quite got it right or they stepped half a step back as a team, then they've really taken that.
[2920.00 - 2927.00] P:1633.47 E:0.080661 |  And so, like I say, they'll feel good going into the half time break and say, actually, we're in this.
[2927.00 - 2931.00] P:1635.38 E:0.095222 |  Rob Green and John Murray will take you through the second half of this game at the Albaic Stadium.
[2931.00 - 2937.00] P:1599.01 E:0.090926 |  Micah Richards is alongside me as well. Micah, what did you think of England in that first half?
[2937.00 - 2948.00] P:1571.38 E:0.086741 |  I thought they was average, if I've been totally honest, Kels. We give them the big build up. You know, in the first game against Saran, there was exceptional, but today they've been sloppy.
[2948.00 - 2958.00] P:1555.61 E:0.087131 |  In possession, the move in the ball too slow. Stones on McGuire needs to step out into midfield to create that space and draw their strikers towards them.
[2958.00 - 2965.00] P:1628.26 E:0.083024 |  Too many sideways passes, some good combinations from Trippier, Bellinom and Saka in the first 20 minutes.
[2965.00 - 2970.00] P:1644.01 E:0.074894 |  But after that, it's almost like England have come to the game today and just expected to win.
[2970.00 - 2978.00] P:1567.41 E:0.101281 |  The reason why they were so good against Saran because they were on the front foot, high energy, midfield today has been non-existent.
[2978.00 - 2987.00] P:1510.21 E:0.092415 |  Moussa McKenney and Adams are running that midfield from the USA and the USA probably deserve to be ahead of them being honest.
[2987.00 - 2994.00] P:1503.43 E:0.103249 |  We've certainly heard from the supporters during this first half. Juliet Farrington is down pitchside right in the midst of it.
[2994.00 - 3004.00] P:1691.28 E:0.096206 |  Just watching England substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jack Grealish, Calvin Phillips, Marcus Rashford going through various passing and crossing drills during this half-time.
[3004.00 - 3011.00] P:1589.47 E:0.087683 |  I've got to say, there are four American guys right behind me. I gave them thumbs up at half-time to think, trying to gauge what they were thinking.
[3011.00 - 3019.00] P:1577.50 E:0.099722 |  I got the double thumbs up back and a scarf held off from one of the USA fans, one nation, one team.
[3019.00 - 3028.00] P:1677.09 E:0.098206 |  Jordan Pickford at the end of that first half certainly affording Luke Shaw when he had that drive to Saka and then pulled up his shorts in frustration.
[3028.00 - 3036.00] P:1593.35 E:0.091606 |  Pickford with Mason Mount and that strike as well because he has been bellowing at his England teammates throughout that first half,
[3036.00 - 3039.00] P:1660.99 E:0.095829 |  especially when the USA were piling on the pressure and had that period.
[3039.00 - 3048.00] P:1639.55 E:0.089183 |  But I'm sure he's got a few things to say at half-time as the substitutes have now left the pitch as well and they'll be going back into that England dressing room.
[3048.00 - 3052.00] P:1582.18 E:0.103070 |  Jules, thank you very much. There are options for Garry Southgate.
[3052.00 - 3060.00] P:1548.16 E:0.101248 |  I just wonder if that energy level that you talked about, Micah, that isn't quite there, might be a product of having played just a few days ago,
[3060.00 - 3066.00] P:1462.48 E:0.098807 |  if maybe they do need some fresh legs, even though it was relatively straightforward against Iran?
[3066.00 - 3072.00] P:1520.58 E:0.097336 |  Yes, maybe, but after the Iran game, you're coming to this game full of confidence.
[3072.00 - 3084.00] P:1611.20 E:0.087930 |  So I don't think we can use that as an excuse. I think we've come to Bay and fought, we've had a great victory and let's try and just play our way through the game.
[3084.00 - 3090.00] P:1547.70 E:0.086434 |  But the playing is too slow. When they've quickened up the tempo of the game, they've got in.
[3090.00 - 3097.00] P:1691.61 E:0.083698 |  But everything they're doing at the moment is too laboured, too slow, and in that second half, they need to quicken it up, sharpen it up,
[3097.00 - 3105.00] P:1728.29 E:0.080685 |  and maybe introduce the Folden, the Greenlish. Kane's up there and not really being in the game, coming a little bit too deep.
[3105.00 - 3111.00] P:1778.92 E:0.077368 |  Sterling's not really being the explosive Sterling we've seen in the last game.
[3111.00 - 3116.00] P:1763.45 E:0.081417 |  And Mount really, you know, the chance at the end, he just needs to go the other side of the goalkeeper.
[3116.00 - 3119.00] P:1801.48 E:0.071162 |  Everything has just been average, if I'm being honest.
[3119.00 - 3125.00] P:1840.34 E:0.098500 |  As much as it's been that way for England, for the USA, there has been that energy from them.
[3125.00 - 3129.00] P:1715.30 E:0.103110 |  They're a young team and that enthusiasm shows on the pitch.
[3129.00 - 3132.00] P:1527.18 E:0.072796 |  They've almost got a bounce in their step.
[3132.00 - 3138.00] P:1637.90 E:0.083254 |  Exactly that. And they've got players who are playing in Europe in some of the biggest leagues in the world for a reason,
[3138.00 - 3142.00] P:1846.47 E:0.078119 |  because they deserve to be playing at this level.
[3142.00 - 3149.00] P:1786.42 E:0.082578 |  And it's like they've come to approach this game today like, OK, we may be the underdogs, but we're going to show everyone what we can do.
[3149.00 - 3154.00] P:1765.05 E:0.077227 |  I think the only thing they are missing, Paul right up front, he's not a clinical striker.
[3154.00 - 3160.00] P:1778.94 E:0.081312 |  If they had a Kane on their side, they'd probably be two-nil up at this moment in time.
[3160.00 - 3167.00] P:1775.95 E:0.078584 |  No real composure for them, but the energy in midfield, it's been a delight to watch, especially that Moosa.
[3167.00 - 3171.00] P:1802.50 E:0.083291 |  He's been running it. He's the general in there. And England need to sharpen up in the second half.
[3171.00 - 3177.00] P:1742.79 E:0.098069 |  USA making life really difficult for England at the Albaic Stadium, but it is still goal-less at halftime.
[3177.00 - 3185.00] P:1657.18 E:0.103458 |  There is one other line to bring you as well. You will remember this decision made by the European teams not to wear the one-love armband.
[3185.00 - 3191.00] P:1439.13 E:0.091956 |  That is that symbol of diversity and inclusion for their opening matches because of the fear of sporting sanctions.
[3191.00 - 3196.00] P:1556.33 E:0.101592 |  We then saw the German players with their hands over their mouths for their team photo.
[3196.00 - 3203.00] P:1635.77 E:0.093230 |  There's been a German politician and a Belgian politician in the stands at World Cup matches wearing the one-love armband.
[3203.00 - 3208.00] P:1726.14 E:0.094029 |  So they've been making their feelings very clear, as have several players in their press conferences.
[3208.00 - 3214.00] P:1726.93 E:0.100357 |  Well, at Wembley this evening, the arch is illuminated in the colours of a rainbow.
[3214.00 - 3222.00] P:1747.31 E:0.093410 |  Tarek Panja, the journalist on social media, has made the point that thousands of miles away from Qatar, away from the referee's book,
[3222.00 - 3228.00] P:1827.95 E:0.093088 |  England's Football Federation takes its brave stance before tonight's game with the US.
[3228.00 - 3233.00] P:1740.98 E:0.104077 |  So an element of irony in Tarek Panja's statement there on social media,
[3233.00 - 3240.00] P:1823.06 E:0.091158 |  but the FA trying to make their point by illuminating the arch at Wembley in the colours of the rainbow.
[3240.00 - 3245.00] P:1617.02 E:0.110072 |  The game itself will get underway very shortly with the score at England nil, USA nil,
[3245.00 - 3251.00] P:1721.59 E:0.085617 |  and will be reflecting on a defeat for Wales earlier in the day after the BBC News.
[3259.00 - 3265.00] P:1845.11 E:0.096703 |  With the headlines on Richard Foster, Scotland's biggest teaching union is striking for another 16 days in January and February
[3265.00 - 3270.00] P:1891.18 E:0.088302 |  in a dispute about pay. Members of the EIS will walk out in two local authorities each day,
[3270.00 - 3273.00] P:1841.31 E:0.060834 |  meaning every pupil will miss one day of lessons.
[3273.00 - 3277.00] P:1873.97 E:0.091671 |  The Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has announced new aid for Ukraine on a visit to Kyiv.
[3277.00 - 3281.00] P:1927.94 E:0.081833 |  He's accused Russia of brutal attacks on civilians and on infrastructure.
[3281.00 - 3284.00] P:1665.97 E:0.073500 |  Missile strikes have caused widespread power blackouts there.
[3284.00 - 3289.00] P:1964.06 E:0.087655 |  President Putin has told mothers of Russian soldiers fighting against Ukraine that he shares their pain.
[3289.00 - 3293.00] P:1808.70 E:0.082329 |  He's been taking part in a meeting with several parents shown on state TV.

[3297.00 - 3302.00] P:1784.28 E:0.087663 |  A potentially hazardous substance has been found on a body discovered in a suburban street in Greater Manchester.
[3302.00 - 3305.00] P:1805.78 E:0.078746 |  It was discovered near Wigan at around 7 o'clock last night.
[3305.00 - 3307.00] P:1583.00 E:0.076283 |  Police are trying to work out who it is.

[3343.00 - 3349.00] P:993.92 E:0.123814 |  Live from Wembley, Saturday night from 10.15 on 5 Live and BBC Sounds.
[3349.00 - 3351.00] P:1197.85 E:0.117946 |  BBC 5 Live.
[3351.00 - 3353.00] P:1239.84 E:0.125491 |  The FIFA World Cup.
[3353.00 - 3357.00] P:1190.50 E:0.116982 |  Qatar 2022 with Kelly Capes.
[3357.00 - 3361.00] P:1554.89 E:0.114237 |  We're at the Albaic Stadium this evening for England against the USA in Group B.
[3361.00 - 3365.00] P:1501.37 E:0.097921 |  There's an opportunity for England to qualify for the knockout stages of the competition,
[3365.00 - 3369.00] P:1682.16 E:0.104262 |  but they're currently drawing nil-nil against USA,
[3369.00 - 3372.00] P:1478.37 E:0.103512 |  who are making life very difficult for England this evening.
[3372.00 - 3376.00] P:1651.86 E:0.098035 |  We'll be back here for the coverage of the second half very shortly.
[3376.00 - 3381.00] P:1549.84 E:0.106712 |  Earlier though, Wales were beaten 2-0 by Iran, so Rob Page has signed a bottom of Group A.
[3381.00 - 3384.00] P:1764.72 E:0.105140 |  They need a win against England to progress. That game's on Tuesday,
[3384.00 - 3387.00] P:1719.00 E:0.097725 |  and they also need other results to go their way.
[3387.00 - 3390.00] P:1658.57 E:0.099131 |  Rick Edwards has been speaking to Dan James.
[3390.00 - 3393.00] P:1457.33 E:0.082910 |  As the game went on, I thought we grew into the game a lot more.
[3393.00 - 3395.00] P:1096.60 E:0.083396 |  Obviously, we went down to 10 men quite late.
[3395.00 - 3398.00] P:1462.55 E:0.091354 |  I thought we would control the ball a bit more.
[3398.00 - 3400.00] P:1625.93 E:0.085758 |  They had a lot of counterattacks, which we defended well,
[3400.00 - 3403.00] P:1521.33 E:0.090485 |  but I thought we would control a bit more, and obviously the red car changes the game.
[3403.00 - 3405.00] P:1259.76 E:0.077995 |  They were threatening us with their counterattack.
[3405.00 - 3408.00] P:1491.23 E:0.077764 |  I think the first goal they take so well is to come out to him,
[3408.00 - 3410.00] P:1422.28 E:0.086153 |  and it's an incredible finish.
[3410.00 - 3416.00] P:1527.46 E:0.077810 |  We push off that equaliser, and it's 4-2, and the guy has a great finish as well.
[3416.00 - 3420.00] P:1402.08 E:0.087979 |  So, yeah, we're super disappointed, but we've got to dust ourselves off now.
[3420.00 - 3423.00] P:1594.67 E:0.069939 |  We've got another big game coming up tomorrow.
[3423.00 - 3426.00] P:1207.84 E:0.080291 |  We've got to hold our heads high and just go into that last game with confidence.
[3426.00 - 3429.00] P:1361.87 E:0.076881 |  What was said in the circle on the pitch after the game?
[3429.00 - 3432.00] P:1320.55 E:0.068005 |  Guys, obviously, he's a captain, he's a leader.
[3432.00 - 3434.00] P:1199.07 E:0.079230 |  He always believes in us, he believes in himself.
[3434.00 - 3438.00] P:1534.24 E:0.079426 |  For us, it's just about going into that last game.
[3438.00 - 3441.00] P:1272.83 E:0.089170 |  We've thought one more game, we can't be disappointed in the thing we're out.
[3441.00 - 3443.00] P:899.35 E:0.082765 |  You never know what happens in group football.
[3443.00 - 3446.00] P:1304.15 E:0.087978 |  We know England are a great team, and we've obviously got to go into that with no fear.
[3446.00 - 3449.00] P:1422.52 E:0.093649 |  We'll watch the game tonight, we'll analyse the game from today
[3449.00 - 3451.00] P:1376.21 E:0.083015 |  and see what we could have done a lot better.
[3451.00 - 3454.00] P:1258.16 E:0.083185 |  We'll go into that last game, and we've got nothing to lose.
[3454.00 - 3458.00] P:1540.45 E:0.078663 |  There is that chance that England have already qualified by the time you come to play them on Tuesday.
[3458.00 - 3460.00] P:1604.10 E:0.084608 |  That might play into your hands.
[3460.00 - 3463.00] P:1123.26 E:0.063385 |  Yeah, you can say that, but even if there were to-rest players,
[3463.00 - 3469.00] P:1375.21 E:0.080134 |  they've got two elevens, great players, fresh legs, they want to win every game they can.
[3469.00 - 3473.00] P:1403.29 E:0.076180 |  We've just got to know that going into it.
[3473.00 - 3477.00] P:1717.84 E:0.096962 |  That was earlier in Group B with Wales Defeat by Iran,
[3477.00 - 3480.00] P:1702.45 E:0.100471 |  and it leaves the group looking like this as things standing.
[3480.00 - 3483.00] P:1562.11 E:0.099786 |  You'll of course draw nil-nil against USA at the moment.
[3483.00 - 3486.00] P:1686.35 E:0.096304 |  That would leave England top of the group on four points.
[3486.00 - 3489.00] P:1649.67 E:0.095067 |  Iran on three points with their victory earlier today.
[3489.00 - 3492.00] P:1543.24 E:0.086702 |  We've put the USA on two points, the draw with Wales,
[3492.00 - 3494.00] P:1728.84 E:0.108358 |  and then the draw potentially this evening,
[3494.00 - 3497.00] P:1683.69 E:0.092356 |  and Wales bottom of the group with just one point.
[3497.00 - 3503.00] P:1701.53 E:0.093436 |  That game between England and Wales on Tuesday could be absolutely crucial for Wales,
[3503.00 - 3506.00] P:1673.31 E:0.092237 |  and it's possible that if England win this evening,
[3506.00 - 3510.00] P:1762.06 E:0.084534 |  they potentially could qualify for the knockout stages.
[3510.00 - 3515.00] P:1717.66 E:0.090233 |  Micah, in terms of the way that that group is panning out,
[3515.00 - 3519.00] P:1631.83 E:0.106998 |  if England don't sharpen up in the second half of this game,
[3519.00 - 3523.00] P:1690.52 E:0.085362 |  they might need something from the game against Wales as well on Tuesday.
[3523.00 - 3526.00] P:1721.34 E:0.085621 |  Exactly that, and that's why I'm thinking,
[3526.00 - 3530.00] P:1818.13 E:0.094736 |  approach this game, you win today, you're through the group,
[3530.00 - 3532.00] P:1597.54 E:0.098906 |  you can introduce players in the third game.
[3532.00 - 3538.00] P:1737.27 E:0.089647 |  I don't know whether, you know, Yansi, are they a bit tired, maybe are a bit tired,
[3538.00 - 3540.00] P:1846.43 E:0.086750 |  but I just thought the confidence from the first game,
[3540.00 - 3543.00] P:1696.00 E:0.084602 |  the come out of this game, out the blocks and the haven,
[3543.00 - 3546.00] P:1730.51 E:0.079714 |  which is a bit frustrating.
[3546.00 - 3548.00] P:1579.73 E:0.094223 |  In the second half, they're going to have to do that,
[3548.00 - 3550.00] P:1868.70 E:0.075018 |  maybe look at changing the system,
[3550.00 - 3552.00] P:1708.58 E:0.084441 |  maybe get another midfield on there,
[3552.00 - 3555.00] P:1685.05 E:0.087586 |  or some bit more pace up front,
[3555.00 - 3559.00] P:1667.95 E:0.083838 |  because at the moment, it's just a bit too laboured,
[3559.00 - 3562.00] P:1692.46 E:0.089379 |  and you don't want to end up drawing or potentially losing this game,
[3562.00 - 3564.00] P:1709.13 E:0.084806 |  going into that Wales game thinking,
[3564.00 - 3567.00] P:1729.61 E:0.084039 |  you've got to get something out of it, and that is the concern.
[3567.00 - 3570.00] P:1783.50 E:0.100744 |  England and USA opponents on the pitch this evening,
[3570.00 - 3574.00] P:1688.10 E:0.109383 |  but the announcer here at the stadium has found something that unites them
[3574.00 - 3577.00] P:1848.68 E:0.105024 |  in the form of Neil Diamond, as they play sweet Caroline,
[3577.00 - 3580.00] P:1860.51 E:0.110660 |  and the England fans and USA fans joining in with this one.
[3580.00 - 3582.00] P:1641.31 E:0.103864 |  I don't know if anybody's sick of it yet,
[3582.00 - 3585.00] P:1685.58 E:0.104464 |  but it's still going strong inside this stadium,
[3585.00 - 3590.00] P:1693.66 E:0.107683 |  but a big 45 minutes coming up for England in terms of their World Cup co-ops,
[3590.00 - 3594.00] P:1720.12 E:0.097730 |  as both of the summarisers here inside the stadium,
[3594.00 - 3597.00] P:1767.21 E:0.094102 |  Michael Richards and Rob Green, decide to get stuck into the Haribos.
[3597.00 - 3599.00] P:1512.28 E:0.106881 |  Other suites, of course, are available,
[3599.00 - 3602.00] P:1708.73 E:0.097377 |  which of you two is best place to start speaking?
[3602.00 - 3604.00] P:1832.05 E:0.105236 |  Absolutely, always ready, mate.
[3605.00 - 3607.00] P:1735.62 E:0.116944 |  Big 45 for England coming up.
[3607.00 - 3610.00] P:1806.71 E:0.106196 |  Yeah, just saying, we've been quite negative about them,
[3610.00 - 3612.00] P:1531.99 E:0.106780 |  and the performance hasn't been where it wants it to be,
[3612.00 - 3616.00] P:1854.44 E:0.080158 |  but don't point it out at the start of the game.
[3616.00 - 3619.00] P:1877.06 E:0.073046 |  They were looking for a clean sheet. They've got a clean sheet so far.
[3619.00 - 3621.00] P:1835.79 E:0.077613 |  It's not been the best. You get through a tournament,
[3621.00 - 3623.00] P:1752.33 E:0.095642 |  and you improve through a tournament.
[3623.00 - 3626.00] P:1871.51 E:0.089124 |  If this was the first game, and we said,
[3626.00 - 3629.00] P:1772.60 E:0.070335 |  I'll tell you what, they've been a bit off it,
[3629.00 - 3632.00] P:1854.87 E:0.086272 |  and haven't got it quite right, you'd say, well, that's why.
[3632.00 - 3635.00] P:1790.16 E:0.081440 |  We've got a bit of a helping hand in the first game.
[3635.00 - 3636.00] P:1881.51 E:0.073348 |  This has been a test.
[3636.00 - 3639.00] P:1893.51 E:0.082504 |  It's been a challenge in different ways from the first game,
[3639.00 - 3641.00] P:1891.74 E:0.079589 |  but we've still got the clean sheet.
[3641.00 - 3644.00] P:1817.47 E:0.079827 |  That's what we wanted. It's not been perfect,
[3644.00 - 3649.00] P:1811.69 E:0.073865 |  but we've still got a great platform here to go and win the game if we improve.
[3650.00 - 3653.00] P:1909.98 E:0.109353 |  US are out on the pitch, England yet to make an appearance,
[3653.00 - 3657.00] P:1460.52 E:0.101776 |  so just in time to bring you up to date with what has happened already today.
[3657.00 - 3659.00] P:1617.31 E:0.084673 |  The host, Katar, won't make it past the group stages.
[3659.00 - 3661.00] P:1631.00 E:0.096457 |  There are three won defeats for them by Sanne Gull.
[3661.00 - 3664.00] P:1663.84 E:0.090530 |  It's left them with no points in group A after two games.
[3664.00 - 3666.00] P:1650.55 E:0.104585 |  Netherlands and Ecuador are joint top of the group.
[3666.00 - 3670.00] P:1490.34 E:0.100532 |  They drew one all, and Neymar and Danilo will miss the rest of the group stages
[3670.00 - 3672.00] P:1428.73 E:0.090911 |  for Brazil due to ankle injuries.
[3672.00 - 3675.00] P:1641.32 E:0.104394 |  Four more commentaries to come on Five Live Tomorrow.
[3675.00 - 3677.00] P:1355.08 E:0.106781 |  We've got all of them for you. You'll know that by now.
[3677.00 - 3679.00] P:1602.92 E:0.094805 |  10 o'clock is Tunisia against Australia,
[3679.00 - 3682.00] P:1609.12 E:0.099097 |  one o'clock for Poland against Saudi Arabia,
[3682.00 - 3684.00] P:1545.55 E:0.081646 |  four o'clock for France against Denmark,
[3684.00 - 3686.00] P:1739.90 E:0.089949 |  and then it's seven o'clock.
[3686.00 - 3690.00] P:1684.67 E:0.096813 |  Just from what we've seen by being out on the streets of Doha,
[3690.00 - 3694.00] P:1590.57 E:0.098680 |  the two best represented fan bases in the competition,
[3694.00 - 3697.00] P:1782.88 E:0.103705 |  Argentina and Mexico go head to head,
[3697.00 - 3700.00] P:1709.57 E:0.111498 |  and we'll have live commentary of that one for you as well.
[3700.00 - 3703.00] P:1759.77 E:0.117651 |  But they're getting set to kick off in the second half here at the Elbate Stadium.
[3703.00 - 3706.00] P:1793.98 E:0.107456 |  It's England nil, USA nil, taking you through it.
[3706.00 - 3708.00] P:1775.53 E:0.107385 |  Rob Green and John Murray.
[3708.00 - 3711.00] P:1782.17 E:0.088003 |  Yes, thank you, Kelly. Alan Shearer is going to be with me
[3711.00 - 3714.00] P:1734.50 E:0.080410 |  for the France-Denmark match, actually.
[3714.00 - 3718.00] P:1655.99 E:0.097420 |  So you'll be able to hear Alan as the summariser on Five Live Tomorrow afternoon.
[3718.00 - 3722.00] P:1650.35 E:0.079712 |  The teams are out, and there are no changes.
[3722.00 - 3724.00] P:1616.81 E:0.082926 |  So the teams, as they started the match,
[3724.00 - 3728.00] P:1684.83 E:0.078303 |  England with Pickford, Trivia Stones, McGuire and Shaw,
[3728.00 - 3732.00] P:1630.13 E:0.064714 |  Rice, Bellingham and Mount, Saka, Sterling and Kane,
[3732.00 - 3735.00] P:1455.90 E:0.101368 |  and the United States as the referee blows the whistle
[3735.00 - 3737.00] P:1475.24 E:0.098883 |  and the Americans get the second half underway,
[3737.00 - 3740.00] P:1473.84 E:0.086683 |  all in blue with the white numbers against England,
[3740.00 - 3743.00] P:1524.11 E:0.101016 |  who are in the almost all-white kit tonight with the blue flashes on the shoulders.
[3743.00 - 3747.00] P:1371.97 E:0.097422 |  USA with Turner and Gull, Dest, Zimmerman, Reem and Robinson at the back,
[3747.00 - 3750.00] P:1431.89 E:0.091920 |  McKenney-Adams and Moosa in midfield,
[3750.00 - 3753.00] P:1489.63 E:0.088663 |  and then Weyer and Pulisic either side of Hadji Wright.
[3753.00 - 3756.00] P:1380.14 E:0.100339 |  That was the only change the Americans made for Ehrhalter,
[3756.00 - 3759.00] P:1452.19 E:0.103442 |  whereas England were unchanged.
[3759.00 - 3762.00] P:1424.83 E:0.082416 |  So, England.
[3762.00 - 3766.00] P:1500.21 E:0.097840 |  On the back foot here is the United States attack on the left-hand side.
[3766.00 - 3769.00] P:1462.54 E:0.090682 |  Robinson turns and plays it back to the halfway line.
[3769.00 - 3772.00] P:1400.58 E:0.098410 |  Jude Bellingham was left on the ground there with a challenge on the halfway line.
[3772.00 - 3775.00] P:1424.53 E:0.098622 |  Moosa plays it to the left-hand side to Robinson.
[3775.00 - 3780.00] P:1367.23 E:0.098255 |  Robinson into the box, headed up and back out to the far side like Declan Rice for a throw.
[3780.00 - 3783.00] P:1467.38 E:0.106234 |  England nil, United States nil.
[3783.00 - 3784.00] P:1287.12 E:0.111562 |  Rob Green.
[3784.00 - 3786.00] P:1472.89 E:0.094758 |  Yeah, Jude Bellingham having a chat with the referee there,
[3786.00 - 3789.00] P:1470.60 E:0.108648 |  and Wright is so clean down in the middle of the pitch,
[3789.00 - 3794.00] P:1198.57 E:0.103520 |  in possession, and all of a sudden, the United States broke through
[3794.00 - 3797.00] P:1352.05 E:0.089223 |  and goop possession for them in a good area.
[3797.00 - 3801.00] P:1313.94 E:0.091275 |  We're looking for England just to have a change of tempo,
[3801.00 - 3807.00] P:1394.14 E:0.086258 |  a change of atmosphere, a change of, really, a spark in this first, in the second half.
[3807.00 - 3809.00] P:1503.37 E:0.098112 |  The United States take the throw, and Robinson gets it back
[3809.00 - 3813.00] P:1429.24 E:0.099939 |  and plays it out of playoff trivia for another throw there near the corner flag
[3813.00 - 3818.00] P:1381.51 E:0.081793 |  in this immense stadium, super ground for football.
[3818.00 - 3820.00] P:1652.10 E:0.098442 |  Almost 70,000 capacity.
[3820.00 - 3825.00] P:1520.37 E:0.084910 |  Ball on the left after the United States take the throw.
[3825.00 - 3827.00] P:1149.11 E:0.086535 |  Goes back to the halfway line.
[3827.00 - 3832.00] P:1322.56 E:0.090749 |  Tim Reem, a full-on back across to his fellow central defender, Zimala,
[3832.00 - 3835.00] P:1642.58 E:0.113073 |  who's pasted in completely the opposite direction to Turner,
[3835.00 - 3838.00] P:1487.56 E:0.101509 |  who was running to his right across the penalty area,
[3838.00 - 3841.00] P:1345.76 E:0.096805 |  and the pass was put ten yards to his left.
[3841.00 - 3844.00] P:1302.88 E:0.095045 |  It was actually on target, but was played with no great pace,
[3844.00 - 3846.00] P:1362.34 E:0.096996 |  so the goalkeeper was at the change direction.
[3846.00 - 3847.00] P:1299.21 E:0.092016 |  Slap the brakes on Rob.
[3847.00 - 3852.00] P:1402.69 E:0.098259 |  Yeah, as a goalkeeper, you get told to change the angle and move away from your goal.
[3852.00 - 3855.00] P:1223.88 E:0.099035 |  Always leaves a question in your back of mind to say,
[3855.00 - 3858.00] P:1145.11 E:0.088566 |  what if the centre half doesn't look?
[3858.00 - 3862.00] P:1273.87 E:0.096512 |  He hits it like that past that Eric Dyer hit the other week.
[3862.00 - 3864.00] P:1117.03 E:0.087739 |  It would have been in the back of the net.
[3864.00 - 3867.00] P:1226.86 E:0.096282 |  Anyway, 0-0, England 0, United States 0,
[3867.00 - 3869.00] P:1246.95 E:0.105770 |  not the subject of sweets at halftime.
[3869.00 - 3875.00] P:1428.69 E:0.092484 |  One of our Qatari hosts in full traditional dress just walked up to producer Gary
[3875.00 - 3879.00] P:1434.44 E:0.090958 |  and said, could he have one of our sweets, one of our Opel fruits?
[3879.00 - 3881.00] P:1395.91 E:0.094587 |  So it's not been a great day for Qatari,
[3881.00 - 3884.00] P:1545.50 E:0.091943 |  so we let him choose whichever colour he wanted.
[3884.00 - 3887.00] P:1541.72 E:0.090251 |  He was eyes lit up when he got one.
[3887.00 - 3891.00] P:1348.62 E:0.085502 |  England 0, USA 0.
[3891.00 - 3894.00] P:1485.20 E:0.077298 |  So Luke Shawl with a throw for England.
[3894.00 - 3898.00] P:1484.31 E:0.085884 |  Rice comes short, but Kenny goes with him,
[3898.00 - 3902.00] P:1385.14 E:0.090036 |  so delay and delay, and then the throw is taken forward under the chest of Sterling.
[3902.00 - 3905.00] P:1457.54 E:0.100962 |  That gives possession back for England.
[3905.00 - 3907.00] P:1478.02 E:0.098934 |  They're attacking from right to left towards the end
[3907.00 - 3911.00] P:1478.65 E:0.096896 |  where most of the England support are gathered down in the lower tier to our left.
[3911.00 - 3915.00] P:1668.43 E:0.096164 |  And now Paul on the right-hand side with Saka who tried to angle it back,
[3915.00 - 3918.00] P:1616.56 E:0.105900 |  but didn't get the pass quite right, and the Americans could be away on the counterattack here.
[3918.00 - 3923.00] P:1556.70 E:0.097858 |  Trippie is out of position, and now it's Puller-Sick who takes it on over the halfway line
[3923.00 - 3927.00] P:1704.28 E:0.106018 |  and plays it forward to right, and hadgie right into the penalty area on his right foot.
[3927.00 - 3930.00] P:1852.50 E:0.097954 |  This is dangerous, but it's blocked, it's blocked,
[3930.00 - 3936.00] P:1673.97 E:0.106092 |  and it comes out though to the shot from McKenney who I think he slipped as he hit that he did, you know,
[3936.00 - 3943.00] P:1517.43 E:0.097410 |  and his one-foot-gave way, and that meant he shuffled it right over the top of the crossbar by probably eight or ten yards.
[3943.00 - 3946.00] P:1563.91 E:0.083521 |  Well that's the jeopardy, that's the chaos that we're talking about.
[3946.00 - 3952.00] P:1352.96 E:0.088086 |  That's what England get it wrong at one end, and all of a sudden, the length of the pitch, the game changes.
[3952.00 - 3958.00] P:1377.57 E:0.082603 |  It's good defending now, showing him inside, showing him inside, mate the block.
[3958.00 - 3963.00] P:1400.23 E:0.095872 |  McKenney has had two shots in this game, and I don't want to put the Mokkas on him,
[3963.00 - 3966.00] P:1454.33 E:0.086809 |  but I'm not putting it down as one of his strong points.
[3966.00 - 3971.00] P:1339.03 E:0.089917 |  England nil, United States nil. He's actually scored nine goals,
[3971.00 - 3977.00] P:1242.86 E:0.096401 |  and now 39 appearances for the USA, which is not a bad goal-scoring record from midfield.
[3977.00 - 3982.00] P:1345.29 E:0.087976 |  Here is Bellingham, plays it towards Sterling.
[3982.00 - 3987.00] P:1565.47 E:0.090579 |  The question will be how long will it be before Garis Southgate decides to make some changes,
[3987.00 - 3990.00] P:1582.12 E:0.087854 |  and we know the strength there is there on the substitute bench.
[3990.00 - 3992.00] P:1514.51 E:0.100794 |  Here's Saka now on the right-hand side for England.
[3992.00 - 4000.00] P:1599.74 E:0.082152 |  Saka back to Trippier behind him, and then Trippier, ball stationary at his feet, uses Sterling, who's found a position.
[4000.00 - 4005.00] P:1640.50 E:0.101614 |  Now into the penalty area, plays it on, but Robinson was able to come back across and get there first,
[4005.00 - 4010.00] P:1430.68 E:0.091279 |  and right footed, clears it to the halfway line, so England will start again.
[4010.00 - 4014.00] P:1342.30 E:0.103251 |  It's good covering by Robinson, he was out wide with Saka, saw the danger.
[4014.00 - 4019.00] P:1376.11 E:0.085441 |  Sterling big touch through the defence, almost a pass to himself.
[4019.00 - 4021.00] P:1178.05 E:0.070763 |  Robinson was alive to it.
[4021.00 - 4026.00] P:1541.33 E:0.105988 |  The other end, I'm just going to give credit to, I think it was Declan Rice, wasn't it, who blocked the shot.
[4026.00 - 4027.00] P:1538.55 E:0.096403 |  It's good defending.
[4027.00 - 4032.00] P:1413.79 E:0.081648 |  Yeah, really good defending, because I had to say, I thought Hadgie Wright was away from him onto his right foot,
[4032.00 - 4035.00] P:1379.69 E:0.073354 |  and that could have caused real problems.
[4035.00 - 4041.00] P:1504.32 E:0.089512 |  The Americans hit the crossbar in the first half, Pulisic, with a flashing shot from outside the penalty area.
[4041.00 - 4046.00] P:1537.13 E:0.087969 |  England have a free kick just inside the American half, which is taken short,
[4046.00 - 4053.00] P:1542.22 E:0.092813 |  and then here is Stones on the halfway line, Stones' curls pass out to the right, that's taken down by Trippier.
[4053.00 - 4060.00] P:1569.54 E:0.092387 |  And now, Mount just found some space, tried to play it into the box, that was blocked by Adams, Trippier was beaten to it, Pulisic.
[4060.00 - 4065.00] P:1591.49 E:0.096761 |  Then beat Mount to it, is Chelsea teammate, and Pulisic is off and running again, Trippier trying to get back.
[4065.00 - 4071.00] P:1512.66 E:0.091644 |  Rice has gone right out there to the far side, but also so has Bellingham, and plays it out of play.
[4071.00 - 4078.00] P:1371.87 E:0.082933 |  I thought again, that had come off the foot of the USA player, but it's given us a throw to the Americans.
[4078.00 - 4086.00] P:1599.93 E:0.087689 |  But it's almost a carbon copy of what we just saw, and it was a ball, this time from Mason Mount, first of the time from Saka.
[4086.00 - 4093.00] P:1613.73 E:0.078121 |  And again, charging down the left-hand side, the team really have got legs.
[4093.00 - 4098.00] P:1535.83 E:0.094626 |  Every match is on 5-5, and BBC sounds from this World Cup.
[4098.00 - 4104.00] P:1458.41 E:0.102974 |  And we've also got an exciting new functionality to tell you about.
[4104.00 - 4107.00] P:1465.13 E:0.097389 |  So when we've got to stop a job, tell you about it.
[4107.00 - 4117.00] P:1593.58 E:0.103909 |  Praise yourself, here's Rice, Rice moves away from Pulisic, and now passes it to Saka, and Saka's got space in front of him, and he takes it on.
[4117.00 - 4126.00] P:1647.33 E:0.104501 |  And here comes across good tackle Adams for the United States, went with him shoulder to shoulder, it was in the area, went to ground, and tackled it out of play on the right.
[4126.00 - 4130.00] P:1439.38 E:0.082371 |  He is pumped, he loved that.
[4130.00 - 4136.00] P:1370.56 E:0.100712 |  Throwing is taken, it's out of play for another throw to England on the right-hand side, I didn't see that.
[4136.00 - 4146.00] P:1391.54 E:0.090023 |  No, it's just the screens here in front of us, after the tackle, got off, no particular direction, just screamed out loud, a whoop, no doubt.
[4146.00 - 4152.00] P:1555.59 E:0.099746 |  The fire through the middle, bounces away from him, and it's cleared away by Zimmerman on the edge of the box, just lifts it forward,
[4152.00 - 4160.00] P:1473.04 E:0.089814 |  offers it to Weyer to run forward, that sure comfortably got there first and plays it back to Pickford.
[4160.00 - 4170.00] P:1396.62 E:0.094081 |  Pickford's first-time task, lovely from him, no particular pressure, but picked out, trivia, was in space on the far side,
[4170.00 - 4179.00] P:1375.01 E:0.098640 |  and then Rice was put under pressure from Hadgy Wright, but England are still keeping the ball inside their own heart.
[4179.00 - 4189.00] P:1559.23 E:0.098699 |  Seven minutes played in the second period, Kane plays it over the top, Mount is onto this, but the ball got away from him, and it bounced into the path of Zimmerman, who is able to tidy up.
[4189.00 - 4196.00] P:1653.10 E:0.087604 |  Paul from Mount again, touch the pass, but when England miss out on a man, when they don't play the simple ball, they get through.
[4196.00 - 4202.00] P:1750.68 E:0.092554 |  Whether it's right to left with a switch, or from defence, straight into Kane, they get through.
[4202.00 - 4215.00] P:1663.83 E:0.089075 |  There's a man down injured on the half-way line, and it's a way of, it was just a sort of, look-sure came in for that, it was a 50-50 with him,
[4215.00 - 4222.00] P:1527.44 E:0.087329 |  I think he's stood on the inside of his boot, maybe, just seeing the replaying now, sort of coming together of ankles.
[4222.00 - 4228.00] P:1520.85 E:0.081218 |  Yeah, top of the ankle, clash, and there's nothing really in it, both win the ball in their own way.
[4228.00 - 4242.00] P:1475.74 E:0.093501 |  The exciting new functionality, Rob, is that if you've joined us late, on most smart speakers, just ask BBC Sounds to rewind to whatever time it is,
[4242.00 - 4251.00] P:1393.80 E:0.088917 |  to go back to the start of our commentary, so ask BBC Sounds to go back to the start of the commentary at whatever time, and you can listen again from the start.
[4251.00 - 4257.00] P:1226.42 E:0.104823 |  Ask BBC Sounds, or the magic words, who it is, an exciting new functionality.
[4257.00 - 4260.00] P:1292.32 E:0.111341 |  Do you think many people will be doing that for this first half?
[4260.00 - 4270.00] P:1277.88 E:0.104562 |  Hell, yes. We might. How many Americans live in the UK, and of course you can listen to BBC Sounds wherever you are in the world, listening this afternoon to Mr. Ian Dennis.
[4270.00 - 4273.00] P:1523.66 E:0.087926 |  What's going on with the sound when I was doing the washing up?
[4273.00 - 4284.00] P:1448.46 E:0.083782 |  Here is... Sorry, it was actually Gary who was doing the washing up, I've got that correct there, yeah, normally it's me but it was Gary today.
[4284.00 - 4294.00] P:1387.01 E:0.090723 |  Not many previous World Cups have done washing up. Here's Bellingham, out to the right-hand side, forward towards Saka, plays it back into his own half, Trippier across to Rice.
[4294.00 - 4304.00] P:1447.29 E:0.087275 |  Rice then picks out the pass to the left-hand side. You do wonder that as that hour mark approaches, must be substitutions in the mind of Gareth Southgate.
[4304.00 - 4317.00] P:1531.85 E:0.087395 |  Kane drags the ball back nicely, then takes it on, mounts here on the left-hand side, mounts, turns, tries to go around, desperate, is forced back, and then back to the halfway line it goes, and Harry McGuire will just tap it to his right again.
[4317.00 - 4323.00] P:1203.38 E:0.089139 |  Declan Rice is there, John Stones is there this time, and now Trippier on the far side.
[4323.00 - 4334.00] P:1309.74 E:0.093467 |  And Mike Richards was saying at half-time about England needing to pass the ball more quickly, get more pace involved in it, we've not really seen that. Rob, have we in the second half yet?
[4334.00 - 4345.00] P:1510.86 E:0.094198 |  It works when they miss out on a man, when it's not the safe pass, and they get it through and they get it round. At the moment it's just not often enough, it's just not good enough.
[4345.00 - 4359.00] P:1319.73 E:0.095200 |  Again there, Trippier trying to play the ball through, passes it into Robinson, bounces out of play, England throw, substitutes are now warming up, 3-4-5 of them, five England substitutes just sprinting up and down the near-touch line, way, way down below us.
[4359.00 - 4371.00] P:1347.93 E:0.085219 |  Shaw takes the ball down on his chest, Shaw back to Rice. Rice has a look forward, but will play it short because the Americans, it's 11-10 blue shirts behind the ball.
[4371.00 - 4382.00] P:1471.56 E:0.097498 |  Headed forward by McGuire at the edge of the box, Kane was there, but he was very closely watched by Zimmerman, and now we're in slights, Sacker illegally says the referee to break it to the USA.
[4382.00 - 4394.00] P:1479.14 E:0.085535 |  He won the ball with the tackle, it was a little tug beforehand, but then before that, John Stones with the straight ball, it just wasn't the right pass, Mason Mount, he's been a bit of a big part player in this game.
[4394.00 - 4405.00] P:1424.78 E:0.086291 |  Now drifting out when England get the ball, drifting out to left back position, in behind Luke Shaw, that's when you know England can't really come up with answers when you've got your creative players having to wonder.
[4405.00 - 4417.00] P:1389.99 E:0.092217 |  The South Gate just questioned that with the fourth official, Yashimi Yamashita down there, there was a little exchange between the two of them, just a query, that's all it was, England nil, USA nil.
[4417.00 - 4439.00] P:1419.71 E:0.084998 |  And it is the United States who have the ball at the back, two previous World Cup meetings, a draw in 2010 in England's first group match, and then the amazing game, the miracle on grass as it was called from fellow horizontal in 1950 when the United States shocked England 1-0.
[4439.00 - 4459.00] P:1593.29 E:0.093132 |  Here's Robinson on the left hand side in field to Musa, and Musa does move it quickly to McKenny, and McKenny now into the box on the right hand side, way up to it back, but intercepted by a stretching Jude Bellingham, very calm, just stepped across and stopped it from reaching anyone in a blue shirt.
[4459.00 - 4472.00] P:1551.26 E:0.090170 |  It's really well read, very mature play, because the idea you think, go chase the ball, go chase the ball, just held his position, they've got to come into the middle of the pitch at some point, they've got to get in front of the goal, I'll just wait and clear it, really mature play.
[4472.00 - 4483.00] P:1439.20 E:0.087421 |  Still waiting for the opening goal of this second group match for these sides, after earlier Iran famously won with those two very late goals against Wales.
[4483.00 - 4494.00] P:1292.61 E:0.091198 |  So England 3 points, Iran 3 points, USA 1, Wales 1 in this group, England Wales on Tuesday, and also of course USA against Iran intriguingly.
[4494.00 - 4500.00] P:1438.25 E:0.088929 |  Just looking at that, just thinking about that, the draw actually doesn't do anything for the USA here.
[4500.00 - 4512.00] P:1622.46 E:0.106679 |  They need to win it, they'll know that, and now the ball's been taken in field by Poulousek, weaving one foot to the other, hit the low shot which took a deflection which pulled it wider than the opposite to USA corner.
[4512.00 - 4522.00] P:1664.01 E:0.106534 |  Again, just taking that half a step back, inviting the run, that's when the USA, they've tried, they really want it, they've got players all over the pitch that can do that.
[4522.00 - 4534.00] P:1643.60 E:0.098366 |  Listen to this, that's the cheers and the throats of the USA supporters inside the ground, stars and stripes being twirled, Stetson's being waved in the air.
[4534.00 - 4553.00] P:1591.72 E:0.095090 |  Corner from the left hand side, see George Washington's down there as well, corner by Poulousek, this is to the back, closed and it's importantly headed away by McGuire with Dest arriving, and then there's a foul by Musa on Jude Dellingham who is less than impressed with that challenge.
[4553.00 - 4558.00] P:1563.36 E:0.089844 |  Musa's put the ball in the net, big cheer from the USA fans but it's a free kick to England.
[4558.00 - 4578.00] P:1516.85 E:0.092942 |  Yeah, really important header from Harry McGuire, he's got the role within the defensive unit, set pieces, four corners to be free in the six yard box, that was critical there because it was Zimmerman three, free at the far post, he lost his run up, England nil, the USA nil.
[4578.00 - 4590.00] P:1554.70 E:0.089162 |  Greg Bear hold that down there, former Crystal Palace man just like Garrus Southgate as the ball is played forward by Pickford but Adams is there, this is worrying for England.
[4590.00 - 4602.00] P:1639.24 E:0.099292 |  Robinson now taking it on, has a look, here's the cross, comes off the head of Declan Rice, that carries it well wide and behind for another corner, another corner to the USA who are building up ahead of Steam here.
[4602.00 - 4615.00] P:1600.61 E:0.098034 |  Yeah, building up ahead of Steam, American fans down in front of Pulisic, captain America, getting even more excited, Jordan Pickford telling the England team just to calm down.
[4615.00 - 4631.00] P:1560.41 E:0.092034 |  So England have got to defend this set piece, Zimmerman just arriving in the penalty area, the grizzled now figure of Tim Reem as well just arrives up there, so it is a corner, Pulisic, big breath, and it comes into the edge of the six yard box, Pickford didn't come, it was headed away.
[4631.00 - 4651.00] P:1639.98 E:0.097617 |  It was headed away by McGuire, still in the area, headed away by Shaw, comes out to the edge of the box, Sterling, and then in comes a crucial challenge, Kane had to time that but he did as Pulisic was looking just a touch it past him but the England captain put it behind, third consecutive corner for USA, nil nil.
[4651.00 - 4659.00] P:1604.70 E:0.096115 |  Well, McGuire is close to getting man of the match here, just from corners, headed away, because there's been vital interceptions.
[4660.00 - 4680.00] P:1661.48 E:0.094638 |  So again, third consecutive corner, all from that far side, the USA left, Pulisic, here's the delivery, and it goes to the edge of the six yard box, McGuire with the header right on the edge of his six yard area, it's played back by Reem, Pulisic takes it down, Pulisic now takes on Harry Kane who was in there defending with his arms behind him.
[4681.00 - 4687.00] P:1647.64 E:0.098336 |  He's behind his back like all the defenders do now and Kane runs it away but shows too much of that to the Americans who have it back again.
[4688.00 - 4697.00] P:1618.72 E:0.090642 |  England are really on the back foot here, Gariselt's getting must be thinking of making a change, it feels like it needs something just to disrupt this USA flow.
[4697.00 - 4705.00] P:1537.25 E:0.084102 |  Yep, just needs us to pause in the game, just needs someone to go down injured to really just take the sting out of it because they are under the pump.
[4706.00 - 4726.00] P:1493.16 E:0.088109 |  So the USA with Zimmerman, Blontair tied back, gives it to Adams in the centre circle who turns all the way around, now back onto his right foot and sprays it past high, Dest heads that back in field, it's Moosa who is onto that but Declan Rice is right there all over the place.
[4727.00 - 4744.00] P:1589.85 E:0.087950 |  They have to go back into their own half, England nil, USA nil, less than half an hour to play. Dest just in front of the coaching areas, takes the ball on past where Greg Bearhalter is standing.
[4745.00 - 4752.00] P:1674.37 E:0.100915 |  Dest now drags it back, that's lovely, beats Bellingham, shot from Pulisic, it's deflected up in the air, McGuire got to it and then across comes Tripp, yeah the header further away.
[4752.00 - 4768.00] P:1716.18 E:0.100601 |  Sterling nods the ball on and this time Mason Mount is beaten to it and in the process shugs over Tyler Adams, the two of them bump bodies as they just get to their feet, free kick to the USA on the right hand side this time, England a labourer in here, struggling.
[4768.00 - 4791.00] P:1636.76 E:0.096457 |  Dest picked up the ball on the touch line and was allowed to run all the way into the centre of the pitch without a challenge and again it was a vital interception from Harri McGuire because the deflection would have taken it straight to right who was on the shoulder, England just can't get the foothold in the game, it got no energy, it needs to make a change.
[4791.00 - 4806.00] P:1581.74 E:0.083662 |  Here on the edge of the desert, the United States are on top, England nil, USA nil, Garra Southgate and Steve Holland are in discussions that we are in 63rd minute and still not a substitution for either side that's most unusual at this World Cup.
[4806.00 - 4823.00] P:1627.48 E:0.093403 |  Robinson playing it forward at the left hand side, Hadji Wright is onto this, Defender comes across and it's blocked behind for another corner, John Stones just has a little word with the Venezuelan referee but it's another corner and it feels like England are living on the edge with these corners.
[4836.00 - 4839.00] P:1490.49 E:0.090238 |  He really sat there looking at it, John there's no way out of the minute.
[4839.00 - 4865.00] P:1616.13 E:0.088187 |  He seems like a long way away, nil nil, so Pulisic again, from that left again standing at right angles to the ball, this one is whipped to the back post, Pickford was struggling there but there was no one arriving on the back post and it actually hit with Pace, he got a touch to it actually, he did get his finger ticked to it and so from that touch beyond the far post and behind for a corner from the other side, the right this time.
[4866.00 - 4888.00] P:1732.11 E:0.098624 |  Yeah just the runners across in the near post, they just catch your eyes a goalkeeper and you take a step forwards towards the near post, the ball goes to the far post and all of a sudden it's a scramble, he did it in off, there was no one behind him but he didn't know, Pulisic has come all the way across and as he does so he just tries to whip up the stars and stripes down there, so it's an out swing at this time.
[4888.00 - 4909.00] P:1686.42 E:0.087891 |  Pulisic to the near post, took a header away for England and that reached Sterling who is shielding it, he's been fouled, he's been fouled by Dest and it's a free kick to England and a chance to relieve the pressure and here's the first substitute who is just peeling off his, in fact let's go down Juliet Farrington behind the goal, let's go to view on that.
[4909.00 - 4924.00] P:1655.70 E:0.085758 |  Yeah the substitution that England will make will be Jordan Henderson, I can just see him, he's taking his bib off, he's receiving instructions from Garaslathgate who has his arm around him right now so Jordan Henderson will be the England player who is going to come on for you John.
[4924.00 - 4939.00] P:1625.30 E:0.079862 |  So Jordan Henderson right move Rob, well it says something doesn't it, you're talking about creative players let's get a, you know create chances, no let's just get some experience, get a foothold in the game, get some know how onto the pitch.
[4939.00 - 4958.00] P:1593.76 E:0.082477 |  Yep so he's just getting his final instructions Jordan Henderson before he steps into this World Cup at the age of 32 and England for once inside the USA half ball played in field by Mount but that's cleared away, the other question of course is who comes off.
[4958.00 - 4960.00] P:1461.58 E:0.072954 |  I think he just gave the ball away.
[4960.00 - 4962.00] P:1392.39 E:0.080925 |  There's the moment.
[4962.00 - 4969.00] P:1548.27 E:0.093064 |  Yep I know he's been a bit part, he's been, not his best performance, I'm a big fan but this has been off it.
[4988.00 - 5000.00] P:1442.91 E:0.091000 |  I'm going to find a way between two England men that Rice is able to put the challenge in, the ball rolls out of play and I think we will see Jordan Henderson coming onto the field now. Or is he quite ready?
[5000.00 - 5002.00] P:1614.22 E:0.102873 |  I think there's more coming as well.
[5002.00 - 5005.00] P:1584.89 E:0.097516 |  Is there going to be another England change Juliet?
[5005.00 - 5016.00] P:1495.54 E:0.096597 |  Yes because Jack Grealish is now receiving his instruction from the England coaching team and he's just getting his shirt ready and getting himself onto the side of the pitch.
[5016.00 - 5025.00] P:1474.25 E:0.090974 |  He's got his arms around Jordan Henderson I can see right now, their deep in conversation, they've obviously been given the game plan. Those will be the players coming on in this double substitution.
[5025.00 - 5038.00] P:1400.12 E:0.091452 |  So that's Jordan Henderson and Grealish so that creativity is going to arrive in the shape of Jack Grealish, England nil, USA nil, United States right on top in this second half.
[5038.00 - 5047.00] P:1331.96 E:0.084863 |  It was even, relatively even in the first half but there's no doubt which team's running it in the second and it's not England.
[5047.00 - 5055.00] P:1495.98 E:0.088444 |  No, he just felt in the first half that England when they got it right they forced errors from America. It's just not happened this time.
[5055.00 - 5062.00] P:1465.52 E:0.088133 |  They just can't force anything, they can't force a press, they can't force any errors, they can't just can't get a grip of the game.
[5062.00 - 5076.00] P:1485.72 E:0.090480 |  Quarter of the match to go England nil, USA nil, there will be a 6-0-6 by the way tonight five live sport on air till 10 o'clock and then Robbie Savage back in the UK and Chris Sutton here in Qatar with us will be taking your calls from 10 o'clock until 11 o'clock.
[5076.00 - 5086.00] P:1371.38 E:0.088897 |  We'll let you know when the lines are open but you can get in touch hashtag BBC 6-0-6. USA played forward but it bounces all the way through for the gold kick.
[5086.00 - 5097.00] P:1521.07 E:0.094838 |  And on a Saturday tomorrow of course really busy sporting day four World Cup commentaries. The FA Cup second round this weekend, the Scottish Cup third round, Broomhill nil, Allo and nil.
[5097.00 - 5105.00] P:1705.12 E:0.089885 |  Last we heard tonight in the Scottish Cup there are five commentaries on Sports Extra from the FA Cup and coverage across the BBC.
[5105.00 - 5115.00] P:1474.19 E:0.098036 |  The change for England, it's Jude Bellingham. Not Mount. I'm sure how that's going down with the England supporters.
[5115.00 - 5127.00] P:1224.27 E:0.098535 |  Raheem Sterling as well, Jack Green is coming on straight swap. That experience is clearly needed.
[5127.00 - 5136.00] P:1212.19 E:0.092329 |  I would say that Jude Bellingham has had his best game in an England shirt but when he's got it right he's been one of the more dangerous players.
[5136.00 - 5148.00] P:1376.53 E:0.093271 |  But here comes Jordan Henderson stepping into what is his sixth major tournament. Three Euros now three World Cups as well for the 32 year old Liverpool captain.
[5148.00 - 5154.00] P:1469.20 E:0.097163 |  I thought he was an absolute certainty to be in this squad. There was no way that Gareth Southgate was leaving him out.
[5154.00 - 5160.00] P:1529.82 E:0.097961 |  Saka receives it from Henderson and now Shaw takes it into the box and crosses left footed but that's headed away by Raheem.
[5160.00 - 5166.00] P:1419.77 E:0.090966 |  Henderson is there, number eight on his back and plays it back to the halfway line. Already instrumental Henderson.
[5166.00 - 5172.00] P:1371.30 E:0.088048 |  He's had three, four, five touches already. Plays the ball to the right hand side to Trippia and then Henderson makes the run.
[5172.00 - 5177.00] P:1533.58 E:0.093003 |  Instead it comes infield to Saka. England already looking better. Saka the Kane on the edge of the box.
[5177.00 - 5183.00] P:1377.42 E:0.085398 |  Kane tries to lift it into the penalty area. That was blocked by Moosa and so the Americans have it back but hit it long.
[5183.00 - 5191.00] P:1506.03 E:0.095416 |  And so England have got it inside their own half. Twenty minutes to play. Rob Green. Yeah all of a sudden Jordan Henderson coming on to the pitch.
[5191.00 - 5199.00] P:1391.97 E:0.089122 |  He says give me the ball. I want the ball. I'm going to play. Then when England two try to recycle it, when they do try to win it back, he's there.
[5199.00 - 5208.00] P:1378.72 E:0.093457 |  Sustain that pressure, sustain the possession. Just the know-how of being in the right place at the right time and how to win it back when it comes out.
[5208.00 - 5218.00] P:1295.15 E:0.095615 |  That reading of the game. England nil, USA nil. Juliet spotted incidentally that Raheem Sterling went down the tunnel after he was brought on.
[5218.00 - 5230.00] P:1509.47 E:0.094874 |  He has Grealish into the action for the first time and into the penalty area and beating two, three men but then over plays it and the USA are able to clear it away and we're back to desk.
[5230.00 - 5234.00] P:1399.30 E:0.092561 |  But Jack Grealish there immediately asking questions of the American defence.
[5234.00 - 5239.00] P:1633.45 E:0.092972 |  Yeah, different. Something different. Something what the Americans have been doing all game. Just driving at players.
[5239.00 - 5245.00] P:1555.33 E:0.096312 |  Paul out of play on the half way line.
[5245.00 - 5261.00] P:1345.05 E:0.089014 |  So Grealish. This is 25th cap. So Grealish is 26th cap. Grealish having scored his first World Cup goal to round things off on Monday afternoon.
[5261.00 - 5266.00] P:1318.00 E:0.090210 |  And the USA are going to respond with their first change down there as well.
[5266.00 - 5275.00] P:1245.82 E:0.092051 |  But we'll see. That in due course. The ball played back to Golgi Vaterna in the D-turner just playing it forward.
[5275.00 - 5285.00] P:1508.00 E:0.092747 |  And Adams now picks out a past at desk who pulls it down, leaps off the ground. Now running away from Mount and then into the challenge that comes in from Luke Shaw.
[5285.00 - 5291.00] P:1505.25 E:0.088152 |  And the ball bounces away. It was a 50-50 between them and it's out of play for what is given as an England throw.
[5291.00 - 5294.00] P:1196.99 E:0.096607 |  So the USA change. That looks like Aronson.
[5294.00 - 5298.00] P:1365.94 E:0.106805 |  It is. Brendan Aronson of Leeds United who is coming on.
[5298.00 - 5305.00] P:1520.37 E:0.096856 |  Allowe winning 1-0 at Brunhal in that Scottish Cup.
[5305.00 - 5311.00] P:1579.08 E:0.094847 |  And the ball is going around Thai tonight. So 5 live sport on it. 9 o'clock in the morning.
[5311.00 - 5316.00] P:1606.72 E:0.096335 |  And Tunisia Australia is the first commentary from 10 o'clock.
[5316.00 - 5321.00] P:1553.86 E:0.094079 |  Breakfast. Rick Edwards here in Qatar. Peter Schmeichels on the program in the morning.
[5321.00 - 5328.00] P:1306.16 E:0.077879 |  And Matt Upson. And Danny Gabbadon. And John Murray as well.
[5328.00 - 5332.00] P:1217.23 E:0.095481 |  And the ball is studded in the morning. England 0. USA 0.
[5332.00 - 5337.00] P:1278.84 E:0.091607 |  I was very impressed with you on the ball ball challenge by the way. Very good. Very good.
[5337.00 - 5340.00] P:1310.20 E:0.112279 |  Well, the adjudicator is still disoriented on my score.
[5340.00 - 5343.00] P:1252.30 E:0.088294 |  It's gone to appeal.
[5343.00 - 5347.00] P:1105.03 E:0.108243 |  It's like the American election. Trump and Bite.
[5347.00 - 5349.00] P:1523.80 E:0.098701 |  I'm not doing it again. I'm not having a recount.
[5349.00 - 5353.00] P:1015.54 E:0.088795 |  England 0. USA 0.
[5353.00 - 5357.00] P:1259.07 E:0.084819 |  And Stones carrying the ball forward.
[5357.00 - 5361.00] P:1250.12 E:0.074712 |  England have got to up this in the remaining...
[5361.00 - 5365.00] P:1376.30 E:0.080621 |  less than 20 minutes now of this match.
[5365.00 - 5369.00] P:1341.28 E:0.095251 |  England know that if they can win the game they will be through to the last 16.
[5369.00 - 5373.00] P:1318.48 E:0.092122 |  But it's been back to the unconvincing stuff from England for large parts of this game now.
[5373.00 - 5375.00] P:1170.71 E:0.078378 |  That's what we have to say.
[5375.00 - 5381.00] P:1266.64 E:0.083161 |  Stones carrying it forward and playing it right footed out towards the left hand side.
[5381.00 - 5383.00] P:1132.94 E:0.088400 |  Mount takes it down.
[5383.00 - 5387.00] P:1281.39 E:0.099182 |  Greelish now moves in field. He's claiming that he was pulled back by Desk.
[5387.00 - 5389.00] P:1442.43 E:0.099204 |  The referee agrees. Gives the free kick.
[5389.00 - 5394.00] P:1403.88 E:0.099873 |  It's actually not unlike the second game at the Euros against Scotland last year.
[5394.00 - 5395.00] P:1546.21 E:0.089554 |  Yeah.
[5395.00 - 5396.00] P:1541.11 E:0.084704 |  Very good.
[5396.00 - 5401.00] P:1659.26 E:0.105592 |  And it's now just looking at the Sergio Lo Desk.
[5401.00 - 5405.00] P:1622.46 E:0.097701 |  He went down with cramp moments ago. Just get the ball to Jack Greelish.
[5405.00 - 5409.00] P:1482.89 E:0.092068 |  He just ran it in then and he was suffering.
[5409.00 - 5411.00] P:1609.13 E:0.097658 |  Reverse pass from Greelish to Mount.
[5411.00 - 5414.00] P:1718.74 E:0.097871 |  Mount gives it back to Greelish. Greelish pulls it back into the area.
[5414.00 - 5417.00] P:1621.68 E:0.084291 |  Very tight for Kane in between.
[5417.00 - 5421.00] P:1640.63 E:0.098253 |  Two men in the box. Moussa and McKenney couldn't find a way through.
[5421.00 - 5423.00] P:1571.27 E:0.104691 |  But it comes back for England and for Greelish.
[5423.00 - 5426.00] P:1679.98 E:0.102694 |  They're looking to Jack Greelish now just like the Euros last year.
[5426.00 - 5430.00] P:1323.22 E:0.072973 |  Come on and do something. Find the spark.
[5430.00 - 5433.00] P:1449.85 E:0.090930 |  Still England now putting more pressure on the United States.
[5433.00 - 5436.00] P:1417.74 E:0.101512 |  And after England have been on the back foot for most of the first half,
[5436.00 - 5439.00] P:1437.15 E:0.092547 |  now it is the United States who are having to defend.
[5439.00 - 5442.00] P:1496.88 E:0.088245 |  And it's up to Kane near the edge of the penalty area.
[5442.00 - 5444.00] P:1433.44 E:0.094194 |  Reem has gone with him.
[5444.00 - 5446.00] P:1302.18 E:0.094530 |  Kane's taking him right away out of the penalty area.
[5446.00 - 5449.00] P:1270.12 E:0.091907 |  However, England have had to go back into their own half.
[5449.00 - 5454.00] P:1196.89 E:0.089078 |  They're recycling it, as they say. McGuire back to Henderson.
[5454.00 - 5456.00] P:1026.90 E:0.084612 |  And then back to McGuire.
[5456.00 - 5460.00] P:1389.16 E:0.090701 |  Jordan Henderson tonight winning his 71st cap for England.
[5460.00 - 5464.00] P:1281.14 E:0.089556 |  So Brendan Aronson, as I mentioned, is going to come on for the United States.
[5464.00 - 5466.00] P:1169.45 E:0.084221 |  Next time the ball is out of play.
[5466.00 - 5471.00] P:1466.35 E:0.095251 |  But here is Rice hitting a long pass for that wave beyond anyone in a white shirt.
[5471.00 - 5475.00] P:1539.80 E:0.098758 |  And stones it was, wasn't it, but the pass.
[5475.00 - 5477.00] P:1464.22 E:0.100269 |  It punches the air in frustration.
[5477.00 - 5479.00] P:1436.28 E:0.107151 |  Let's go back down to Juliet Farrington behind the goal.
[5479.00 - 5483.00] P:1570.24 E:0.098011 |  Here I can see Brendan Aronson waiting patiently as the officials there
[5483.00 - 5487.00] P:1533.34 E:0.103141 |  between the dugouts get the ball ready and permission to make that substitution.
[5487.00 - 5492.00] P:1507.77 E:0.101444 |  Marcus Rashford right now is the England player doing the latest warm-up
[5492.00 - 5495.00] P:1672.94 E:0.093927 |  as he walks away from the corner flag to my right.
[5495.00 - 5500.00] P:1596.69 E:0.085127 |  As Calvin Phillips comes out from the England bench to continue his warm-ups,
[5500.00 - 5503.00] P:1675.81 E:0.094922 |  maybe England will be making another substitution.
[5503.00 - 5506.00] P:1651.14 E:0.096248 |  15 minutes to go. Five live from the BBC.
[5506.00 - 5509.00] P:1552.04 E:0.093232 |  Take the world cup with you on BBC Sounds.
[5509.00 - 5511.00] P:1490.00 E:0.079452 |  And here's Jack Grealish in the centre circle.
[5511.00 - 5514.00] P:1598.24 E:0.095564 |  Grealish playing the ball to Mount on the left-hand side.
[5514.00 - 5517.00] P:1663.29 E:0.099693 |  Shaw goes with him. The two of them almost shoulder to shoulder.
[5517.00 - 5519.00] P:1682.08 E:0.076022 |  Mount just touches it to Shaw.
[5519.00 - 5521.00] P:1504.56 E:0.088792 |  Back to Mount, all very tight.
[5521.00 - 5523.00] P:1527.22 E:0.080047 |  The Americans have been so disciplined.
[5523.00 - 5527.00] P:1473.76 E:0.091450 |  You know, this is a well-coached team as Garrel Southgate said it was yesterday.
[5527.00 - 5529.00] P:1539.92 E:0.070293 |  Rice out to the right-hand side then.
[5529.00 - 5530.00] P:1431.12 E:0.084714 |  Trippier is there.
[5530.00 - 5533.00] P:1396.30 E:0.093010 |  Trippier back in field towards Rice.
[5533.00 - 5538.00] P:1597.13 E:0.084120 |  And then Rice tugging the ball to his left to look Shaw again.
[5538.00 - 5540.00] P:1338.55 E:0.087863 |  And then back into the centre circle.
[5540.00 - 5542.00] P:1414.18 E:0.099672 |  Rob Green's already made the point, really.
[5542.00 - 5546.00] P:1468.86 E:0.098565 |  Two draws for the United States to leave them on two points going into the final match.
[5546.00 - 5548.00] P:1373.89 E:0.110743 |  It's not ideal for them, really.
[5548.00 - 5551.00] P:1505.96 E:0.086656 |  You're in a situation now where you've got to win a game
[5551.00 - 5556.00] P:1339.82 E:0.087522 |  and they get the same opportunity as they do now with 15 minutes to go against Iran.
[5556.00 - 5561.00] P:1438.30 E:0.094267 |  They'll know exactly what Iran are capable of now after really finding their true selves,
[5561.00 - 5565.00] P:1446.02 E:0.074087 |  I would say, in this world cup earlier against Wales.
[5565.00 - 5567.00] P:1688.48 E:0.095873 |  McGuire, Ford through the middle.
[5567.00 - 5572.00] P:1481.37 E:0.086775 |  Saka takes that, turns and runs and then rolls it to the right-hand side to Trippier.
[5572.00 - 5574.00] P:1406.58 E:0.107034 |  And now Henderson early ball into the penalty area to Saka.
[5574.00 - 5577.00] P:1634.71 E:0.095457 |  The flag stayed down against Saka, but he was forced to take it wide
[5577.00 - 5581.00] P:1476.56 E:0.102325 |  and there were two men in there again as well, well defended by the USA.
[5581.00 - 5584.00] P:1414.32 E:0.084317 |  Comes back to McGuire, who passes it through the middle.
[5584.00 - 5585.00] P:1560.52 E:0.090595 |  Mount helps it on.
[5585.00 - 5589.00] P:1661.27 E:0.096130 |  Kane goes past Reem, plays it to Saka, looked like he was offside.
[5589.00 - 5593.00] P:1595.02 E:0.103406 |  In comes Reem with a challenge to put it behind for what it will not be a corner
[5593.00 - 5596.00] P:1569.35 E:0.099947 |  because Saka was offside and it's the free kick to USA.
[5596.00 - 5598.00] P:1542.17 E:0.107048 |  It's just not happening for McGuire Saka tonight.
[5598.00 - 5601.00] P:1527.30 E:0.103126 |  It's just not been his game.
[5601.00 - 5604.00] P:1469.52 E:0.107506 |  Sits coming on, he's made a real difference.
[5604.00 - 5607.00] P:1557.50 E:0.096046 |  Jack Grealish not in terms of justly confidence on the ball,
[5607.00 - 5612.00] P:1336.24 E:0.099077 |  but also tactically, McKenney is so aware of it,
[5612.00 - 5616.00] P:1507.11 E:0.086306 |  he's having to drop back into right back now to support Zaginio Des,
[5616.00 - 5618.00] P:1337.92 E:0.086885 |  who's now gone down again.
[5618.00 - 5622.00] P:1480.59 E:0.082586 |  Get the ball to Jack Grealish, just give him the ball and let him run.
[5622.00 - 5624.00] P:1475.94 E:0.082943 |  What can you see, Juliet?
[5624.00 - 5627.00] P:1383.42 E:0.086691 |  I can see that Arison is now going to come on to the pitch.
[5627.00 - 5630.00] P:1551.69 E:0.104767 |  But also Marcus Rashford, I was telling you, was doing that warm-up.
[5630.00 - 5632.00] P:1515.15 E:0.095956 |  Steve Holland called him back.
[5632.00 - 5634.00] P:1567.03 E:0.086213 |  Rashford ready to come on to the pitch.
[5634.00 - 5638.00] P:1407.75 E:0.086840 |  The attendance here, 68,463.
[5638.00 - 5645.00] P:1361.20 E:0.099966 |  So, over 68,000 people sitting in this extraordinary stadium
[5645.00 - 5651.00] P:1279.69 E:0.089813 |  on the edge of the desert in Qatar, watching England nil, USA nil.
[5651.00 - 5655.00] P:1115.01 E:0.093646 |  And Brendan Aronson is already on to the field,
[5655.00 - 5662.00] P:1372.30 E:0.081357 |  but also Shaq Muir is going to come on for Dest as you spotted Rob.
[5662.00 - 5665.00] P:1569.95 E:0.087361 |  Dest struggling with a maybe cramp.
[5665.00 - 5671.00] P:1542.84 E:0.079707 |  Anyway, Shaq Muir of Nashville is going to come on to play there.
[5671.00 - 5674.00] P:1503.68 E:0.080176 |  Two players on the right-hand side to freshen it up.
[5674.00 - 5678.00] P:1267.19 E:0.092965 |  And you just think that Greg Barholtz, a USA manager,
[5678.00 - 5682.00] P:1442.01 E:0.091012 |  has just realised that that freshness, that side is needed.
[5682.00 - 5684.00] P:1391.32 E:0.090292 |  They need it because all of a sudden,
[5684.00 - 5687.00] P:1313.44 E:0.095753 |  Jack Grealish on the ball out there causing problems.
[5687.00 - 5695.00] P:1489.36 E:0.093743 |  And it is Saka who is seeing his number go up, the number 17 on the board.
[5695.00 - 5698.00] P:1764.99 E:0.099780 |  And Marcus Rashford is cheered onto the field,
[5698.00 - 5700.00] P:1695.57 E:0.103221 |  made an immediate impact, didn't he,
[5700.00 - 5704.00] P:1637.21 E:0.098743 |  in the opening match against Iran, scored within a matter of seconds.
[5705.00 - 5709.00] P:1399.78 E:0.100340 |  We hope for that tonight, but we're a reception for him.
[5709.00 - 5715.00] P:1295.35 E:0.084977 |  He struggles, he hopes that that goal really sparks him into life for England.
[5715.00 - 5720.00] P:1388.80 E:0.067691 |  England nil, USA nil.
[5720.00 - 5724.00] P:1478.66 E:0.083087 |  And amongst all of the stories at this World Cup,
[5724.00 - 5728.00] P:1503.07 E:0.095995 |  there have been an increasing number of nil-nil draws up there.
[5728.00 - 5732.00] P:1594.92 E:0.091683 |  Here's Robinson, though, for the United States, now coming forward.
[5732.00 - 5735.00] P:1473.32 E:0.081936 |  Again, on the left-hand side, it's played in field.
[5735.00 - 5739.00] P:1471.34 E:0.085522 |  Tyler Adams takes it up, plays it to the edge of the area.
[5739.00 - 5741.00] P:1571.26 E:0.078773 |  Pullers-Sick now put under pressure.
[5741.00 - 5744.00] P:1557.04 E:0.098235 |  Well done, Rice, came across shoulder to shoulder.
[5744.00 - 5747.00] P:1559.69 E:0.083977 |  That was Declan Rice, that was... yeah, copybook.
[5747.00 - 5751.00] P:1449.84 E:0.089905 |  Declan Rice to put in the challenge and force him to play through for a goal kick.
[5751.00 - 5754.00] P:1333.19 E:0.080716 |  Reactive, Mason Mount and Ritmus Redd, the touch,
[5754.00 - 5757.00] P:1429.69 E:0.083742 |  and just pleaded for someone to step across.
[5757.00 - 5761.00] P:1326.82 E:0.075084 |  There he was, the fireman, fighting the fires.
[5761.00 - 5763.00] P:1487.97 E:0.070567 |  Seeing the danger.
[5764.00 - 5767.00] P:1444.16 E:0.084346 |  That's Rob Green, this is Five Live.
[5767.00 - 5774.00] P:1384.05 E:0.089751 |  England nil, USA nil, 6-0-6 coming tonight after we round up the day's events in the World Cup.
[5774.00 - 5786.00] P:1486.63 E:0.088713 |  And then you will have your chance to talk to Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton on 6-0-6.
[5787.00 - 5793.00] P:1650.38 E:0.100358 |  So, we have had five nil-nil draws in Qatar so far,
[5793.00 - 5799.00] P:1609.10 E:0.096205 |  and the record at the World Cup is seven, which has happened on four different occasions.
[5799.00 - 5803.00] P:1366.50 E:0.089436 |  Thank you to my personal statistician, Micah Richards.
[5804.00 - 5807.00] P:1339.08 E:0.092239 |  Now going to take him wherever I go in Qatar.
[5807.00 - 5809.00] P:1389.04 E:0.088713 |  In fact, it's Kelly, it's Kelly.
[5809.00 - 5811.00] P:1136.89 E:0.093294 |  That'll be it, that'll be it. That'll... that'll... that'll... that'll...
[5811.00 - 5813.00] P:1058.07 E:0.078597 |  That's a good point, it's a good point, Rob.
[5813.00 - 5817.00] P:1284.66 E:0.098122 |  It's easier to take Kelly with me than take Kelly to the World Cup.
[5817.00 - 5823.00] P:1477.54 E:0.094522 |  Here's Mount, Mount now, as he's challenged by Aronson, and Aronson comes away,
[5823.00 - 5827.00] P:1570.62 E:0.087608 |  and now ten minutes to go, the United States mount another attack.
[5827.00 - 5832.00] P:1694.95 E:0.100123 |  Maguire comes across and gets there first ahead of where, went to ground and put it out of play.
[5832.00 - 5835.00] P:1679.27 E:0.093405 |  Now, it's just a couple of times now that the United States have...
[5835.00 - 5837.00] P:1397.98 E:0.085379 |  They've been on the back foot for the last five, ten minutes.
[5837.00 - 5840.00] P:1547.33 E:0.080497 |  Five, ten minutes, Inglis made those two subs.
[5840.00 - 5844.00] P:1501.50 E:0.090441 |  Just the forward ball, they've had glimpses, but they haven't got it right.
[5844.00 - 5846.00] P:1547.05 E:0.086281 |  Much like England for the most of this second half.
[5846.00 - 5853.00] P:1368.14 E:0.082155 |  It is the United States coming forward with the newly arrived Muir,
[5853.00 - 5860.00] P:1307.67 E:0.073471 |  and now... Wehr back into center field to Zimmerman,
[5860.00 - 5863.00] P:1379.03 E:0.091825 |  and then back to the halfway line the Americans go.
[5863.00 - 5868.00] P:1552.70 E:0.101326 |  We are now into the final ten minutes, and there's a feeling of tension around the plays.
[5868.00 - 5872.00] P:1662.60 E:0.096833 |  Grealish misplaces the pass, groans from the England supporters.
[5872.00 - 5874.00] P:1502.86 E:0.094542 |  The United States clear it downfield.
[5874.00 - 5879.00] P:1361.90 E:0.085527 |  Jordan Henderson takes it up again in center field and passes it back to Stones.
[5879.00 - 5883.00] P:1511.27 E:0.081147 |  The substitutions have certainly lifted England.
[5883.00 - 5885.00] P:1453.73 E:0.070950 |  Could they have come earlier?
[5885.00 - 5889.00] P:1545.94 E:0.093908 |  Rob, you can answer that in a moment, because England are bringing it forward now,
[5889.00 - 5893.00] P:1572.08 E:0.094929 |  from the back with Mount, and he plays it across to Kane, who's 25 yards out,
[5893.00 - 5896.00] P:1509.82 E:0.087623 |  but already a defender is there with him, Robinson.
[5896.00 - 5899.00] P:1611.47 E:0.093768 |  He uses Trippier on the right-hand side, now back to Kane.
[5899.00 - 5902.00] P:1702.85 E:0.093732 |  It's swirled in by Henderson, Henderson with the cross,
[5902.00 - 5908.00] P:1701.75 E:0.103422 |  but Turner comes and catches it high above the head of Harry Kane and Grealish inside the far side of the six-yard box.
[5908.00 - 5912.00] P:1544.53 E:0.079572 |  Yeah, it's four or five times in this game that Turner in the goal,
[5912.00 - 5915.00] P:1576.79 E:0.087021 |  where the United States has come and claimed good crosses.
[5915.00 - 5920.00] P:1656.85 E:0.089478 |  But that also, what that suggests is the quality of the crosses, they haven't been good enough.
[5921.00 - 5926.00] P:1400.35 E:0.099563 |  We've had 81 minutes, still waiting for the opening goal.
[5926.00 - 5930.00] P:1392.13 E:0.102860 |  Poulsenk had a post in the first half, there were other good chances as well.
[5930.00 - 5933.00] P:1480.66 E:0.095258 |  McKenney came for England, that was very early on,
[5933.00 - 5936.00] P:1648.97 E:0.094767 |  but here is Muir on the right-hand side for the United States.
[5936.00 - 5941.00] P:1366.39 E:0.076531 |  Muir gets it back, and then he looks to get it back from where, which he does.
[5941.00 - 5948.00] P:1576.54 E:0.078857 |  And then Muir playing for the United States, but the greatest World Cup name for England,
[5948.00 - 5950.00] P:1606.09 E:0.095091 |  Muir on the field playing against England.
[5950.00 - 5956.00] P:1581.42 E:0.089149 |  Bull played forward and that's a free kick for the challenge on Luxo, and it's a free kick.
[5956.00 - 5959.00] P:1539.37 E:0.099704 |  And another substitution, two more in fact for the United States.
[5959.00 - 5966.00] P:1595.42 E:0.096415 |  So this time, Weyer is going to be replaced by Giovanni Reina,
[5966.00 - 5971.00] P:1670.14 E:0.098577 |  the English-born, the Sunderland-born son of Claudio Reina,
[5971.00 - 5975.00] P:1661.49 E:0.093060 |  coming on for his first taste of action at this World Cup.
[5975.00 - 5980.00] P:1691.67 E:0.093200 |  And also coming off is Haji Wright.
[5980.00 - 5987.00] P:1541.08 E:0.102061 |  And it is the Norwich City man, Josh Sargent, who is left out tonight,
[5987.00 - 5990.00] P:1335.26 E:0.099667 |  but he is now on to replace right up front.
[5991.00 - 6001.00] P:1312.70 E:0.094202 |  Reina is a really talented footballer, dogged by injuries throughout his time throughout his wrestling career.
[6001.00 - 6006.00] P:1315.87 E:0.092595 |  Josh Sargent scored goals for Norwich this season, playing as a centre forward,
[6006.00 - 6009.00] P:1329.03 E:0.091610 |  but keeps on getting moved out wide right and stopped scoring.
[6009.00 - 6013.00] P:1346.32 E:0.070469 |  This time, up front and centre, he's not got long.
[6013.00 - 6018.00] P:1567.51 E:0.082044 |  So a double change from Greg Berhalter to forward changes.
[6018.00 - 6021.00] P:1372.44 E:0.087458 |  Reina playing on the right-hand side and Sargent in the middle.
[6021.00 - 6023.00] P:1412.09 E:0.086551 |  Time running out for both of them.
[6023.00 - 6026.00] P:1508.29 E:0.089053 |  England 0, USA 0, the moment.
[6026.00 - 6030.00] P:1445.03 E:0.086903 |  It's going to be a second consecutive draw for the United States.
[6030.00 - 6035.00] P:1293.80 E:0.087155 |  Back with Turner though, there have been so many late goals in this World Cup,
[6035.00 - 6038.00] P:1385.97 E:0.079376 |  not least in the earlier match in this group.
[6038.00 - 6041.00] P:1509.90 E:0.094832 |  USA playing it out from the back, that's nice.
[6041.00 - 6044.00] P:1501.21 E:0.091752 |  And it's Robinson who plays it in field.
[6044.00 - 6047.00] P:1496.48 E:0.095129 |  Robinson, Sturmwell actually the full-on left back in this match,
[6047.00 - 6050.00] P:1579.94 E:0.101174 |  but it's been given away by Muir, the right back in England.
[6050.00 - 6053.00] P:1629.30 E:0.098015 |  Here's Grealish, Grealish away from Muir who caught him.
[6053.00 - 6056.00] P:1707.05 E:0.094536 |  Grealish sent down, sprawling onto his front,
[6056.00 - 6058.00] P:1553.12 E:0.098476 |  so a free kick out on the left wing for England.
[6058.00 - 6060.00] P:1481.74 E:0.080452 |  There's a clear tactic here.
[6060.00 - 6064.00] P:1489.52 E:0.083730 |  Sargent, a desk, couldn't do it because he was so tired,
[6064.00 - 6066.00] P:1548.11 E:0.074159 |  but just get as tight as he can to Jack Grealish.
[6066.00 - 6068.00] P:1684.13 E:0.097625 |  Don't let him travel with the ball.
[6068.00 - 6071.00] P:1563.39 E:0.074472 |  There's been two shots on target in the whole game.
[6071.00 - 6073.00] P:1485.68 E:0.073295 |  I think that pretty much sums it up.
[6075.00 - 6079.00] P:1469.54 E:0.101222 |  But over the piece that we've seen so far, 84 minutes now,
[6079.00 - 6082.00] P:1521.23 E:0.089129 |  they've been quite well matched.
[6082.00 - 6086.00] P:1733.48 E:0.097900 |  You'd say, at point, would obviously suit England better,
[6086.00 - 6090.00] P:1669.16 E:0.091864 |  but USA would take more heart from the performances.
[6090.00 - 6095.00] P:1635.69 E:0.088727 |  Free kick then, on the left as a result of that foul on Grealish.
[6095.00 - 6100.00] P:1528.67 E:0.085065 |  Sure to play this in, looking for the delivery, the pinpoint delivery.
[6100.00 - 6102.00] P:1424.56 E:0.085456 |  Maguire making the run.
[6102.00 - 6104.00] P:1737.26 E:0.094525 |  Here's the cross from Shaw from the free kick,
[6104.00 - 6107.00] P:1573.08 E:0.077780 |  but cleared away by Tim Reem.
[6107.00 - 6110.00] P:1579.50 E:0.113528 |  And then the ball put out of play, Pulisic was there,
[6110.00 - 6113.00] P:1651.95 E:0.085044 |  and it's played out by Pulisic.
[6113.00 - 6115.00] P:1496.73 E:0.099558 |  Or was he fouled?
[6115.00 - 6117.00] P:1417.36 E:0.099107 |  Foul on Pulisic.
[6117.00 - 6119.00] P:1454.56 E:0.092582 |  Free kick to the USA deep inside the wrong half.
[6119.00 - 6122.00] P:1522.30 E:0.086764 |  So we have five minutes to go, just over five minutes,
[6122.00 - 6125.00] P:1374.21 E:0.073920 |  plus added time, whatever that might be.
[6125.00 - 6128.00] P:1388.44 E:0.078164 |  Think of a number, double it.
[6128.00 - 6132.00] P:1538.19 E:0.080002 |  So a free kick that Turner is going to take.
[6135.00 - 6138.00] P:1416.08 E:0.096985 |  He's been a frustrating performance by England.
[6138.00 - 6141.00] P:1443.19 E:0.108488 |  None more so the gesticulations of Mike, who sat next,
[6141.00 - 6144.00] P:1480.50 E:0.083146 |  they think they've summed it up during the 90 minutes.
[6144.00 - 6146.00] P:1361.30 E:0.105060 |  Yep, more from Mike over the course of the next hour.
[6146.00 - 6148.00] P:1492.75 E:0.103432 |  We'll have the live interviews as well.
[6148.00 - 6151.00] P:1369.12 E:0.084639 |  To get the machine working downstairs in the tunnel area.
[6151.00 - 6155.00] P:1544.75 E:0.095566 |  So Grealish takes it down and plays it back to Shaw,
[6155.00 - 6160.00] P:1474.16 E:0.085322 |  and then Shaw back to the edge of the penalty area to Harry Maguire.
[6160.00 - 6163.00] P:1470.16 E:0.094123 |  That's what he'd want for his 50th cap, a clean sheet.
[6163.00 - 6167.00] P:1376.74 E:0.096038 |  Maguire certainly, Rice playing it back behind Stones.
[6167.00 - 6169.00] P:1478.78 E:0.090014 |  This is how the match began, actually.
[6169.00 - 6172.00] P:1401.27 E:0.102867 |  Stones and Rice and Maguire playing the ball around the edge
[6172.00 - 6174.00] P:1443.75 E:0.090112 |  of their own penalty area.
[6174.00 - 6176.00] P:1656.57 E:0.104066 |  Certainly none of the floor really, or little of the floor,
[6176.00 - 6179.00] P:1448.82 E:0.077628 |  should I say, that we saw from England
[6179.00 - 6182.00] P:1270.20 E:0.095238 |  against the hapless Iranians on Monday afternoon.
[6182.00 - 6184.00] P:1335.96 E:0.096692 |  England 0, USA 0.
[6184.00 - 6187.00] P:1656.96 E:0.092591 |  Take Fudd out to Shaw.
[6187.00 - 6191.00] P:1465.72 E:0.092811 |  I think those England supporters want to see England moving it forward
[6191.00 - 6194.00] P:1651.20 E:0.084121 |  and getting it forward quickly and trying to win this game.
[6194.00 - 6197.00] P:1441.53 E:0.087051 |  If they win the game tonight, they get this late goal and win it,
[6197.00 - 6199.00] P:1384.12 E:0.075463 |  England will be through.
[6199.00 - 6203.00] P:1341.40 E:0.088334 |  But I think those England fans are suggesting that there's not enough urgency.
[6203.00 - 6207.00] P:1618.11 E:0.082756 |  There isn't urgency in the game, but you just feel that
[6207.00 - 6210.00] P:1699.03 E:0.101732 |  they've just not had the foothold in the game to really
[6210.00 - 6213.00] P:1632.04 E:0.093723 |  put the foot down and say, well, we've had control,
[6213.00 - 6216.00] P:1647.25 E:0.093981 |  we've had possession, we can dictate.
[6216.00 - 6219.00] P:1625.54 E:0.090443 |  They've just not had it, it's just not been that game.
[6219.00 - 6222.00] P:1547.17 E:0.088053 |  No, Grealish playing it back to Harry Kane,
[6222.00 - 6225.00] P:1748.59 E:0.107215 |  who plays it through to Rashford, and Rashford takes it on.
[6225.00 - 6229.00] P:1650.40 E:0.097375 |  He's got defenders all around him, leaps nimbly away from Zimmerman,
[6229.00 - 6231.00] P:1764.77 E:0.082913 |  gives it to Grealish.
[6231.00 - 6233.00] P:1684.02 E:0.109218 |  Grealish now coming across the edge of the penalty area,
[6233.00 - 6234.00] P:1603.87 E:0.098063 |  a back heel to Rashford.
[6234.00 - 6236.00] P:1738.83 E:0.090634 |  Rashford puts his foot on it, whips it forwards,
[6236.00 - 6239.00] P:1748.90 E:0.100941 |  but an easy one to turn at, just to take into his gloves.
[6239.00 - 6244.00] P:1663.19 E:0.090267 |  A couple of little steps to his left and caught it.
[6244.00 - 6246.00] P:1386.02 E:0.071004 |  Yeah, he caught it.
[6246.00 - 6248.00] P:1368.72 E:0.084690 |  It was nearly a back pass, it was out of slow.
[6248.00 - 6254.00] P:1444.32 E:0.084022 |  It just would have had to have been 10-point perfection for that to go in on that angle.
[6254.00 - 6257.00] P:1333.14 E:0.086537 |  There's so little bit back lift, so little power into the shot,
[6257.00 - 6260.00] P:1511.89 E:0.085637 |  you have to say probably it was a poor choice from Rashford.
[6260.00 - 6264.00] P:1399.89 E:0.081446 |  But then again, Grealish gets the ball, a little bit of life, a little bit something.
[6264.00 - 6267.00] P:1388.02 E:0.084013 |  England nil, USA nil.
[6267.00 - 6270.00] P:1287.09 E:0.080780 |  You've hardly made a note in the second half, in terms of chances.
[6270.00 - 6273.00] P:1504.71 E:0.091349 |  The shot from right that was blocked by Rice,
[6273.00 - 6283.00] P:1412.69 E:0.086033 |  and Rashford with that one there, which was very much in the bracket of easy goalkeeping saves,
[6283.00 - 6285.00] P:1522.54 E:0.099035 |  at any level really.
[6285.00 - 6288.00] P:1418.58 E:0.086261 |  And now he has Aronson for the United States,
[6288.00 - 6291.00] P:1205.28 E:0.084030 |  two and a half minutes of the 90 to play.
[6291.00 - 6294.00] P:1286.09 E:0.085307 |  Aronson, he is his lead United teammate.
[6294.00 - 6298.00] P:1411.22 E:0.083781 |  Adams, Muir from right back for USA.
[6298.00 - 6302.00] P:1544.18 E:0.094271 |  Now it's been taken on and forward by Reynat towards the edge of the area,
[6302.00 - 6307.00] P:1634.75 E:0.101101 |  but England are able to win it back, and it's been brought forward by Maguire, who passes it.
[6307.00 - 6309.00] P:1642.40 E:0.096531 |  That's asking a lot of Harry Kane.
[6309.00 - 6314.00] P:1534.88 E:0.095201 |  Zimmerman is able to get there first and pass it back into his penalty area to Turner,
[6314.00 - 6319.00] P:1484.94 E:0.087251 |  who finds Muir, but Mount is chasing him back to Zimmerman.
[6319.00 - 6323.00] P:1587.17 E:0.093562 |  The ball is played across the penalty area, Turner takes a touch and his left goes,
[6323.00 - 6327.00] P:1594.72 E:0.106488 |  Mount is still going, and the goalkeeper is running out of the penalty area altogether,
[6327.00 - 6335.00] P:1653.79 E:0.085556 |  chased by Mount, and now forward it goes, and Moussa gives it to the left-hand side.
[6335.00 - 6339.00] P:1635.50 E:0.101659 |  This could be dangerous, back to Aronson, just outside the area.
[6339.00 - 6342.00] P:1728.85 E:0.097186 |  The ball is worked across, all the way to the right-hand side, Muir.
[6342.00 - 6347.00] P:1741.84 E:0.096815 |  One good ball across from Muir, but he couldn't find it, he passed it straight to Rice,
[6347.00 - 6352.00] P:1530.76 E:0.089441 |  and Deckman Rice was able to get it away to Grealish,
[6352.00 - 6356.00] P:1380.05 E:0.085033 |  and then from there to safety by Pinkford.
[6356.00 - 6364.00] P:1479.10 E:0.086093 |  It sums up the game, it gets the ball, a real opportunity to pick out someone more on that right-hand side.
[6364.00 - 6368.00] P:1556.18 E:0.089006 |  Just that bit of quality, what have you got? Not enough.
[6368.00 - 6371.00] P:1618.93 E:0.099371 |  And that's for both teams, as we're saying.
[6371.00 - 6380.00] P:1609.78 E:0.095282 |  So few shots on target, shows huge clear-cut quality chances, so little quality play.
[6380.00 - 6386.00] P:1389.39 E:0.092341 |  So I think Gareth Southgate will praise the defending, that's what he'll do.
[6386.00 - 6391.00] P:1381.99 E:0.087469 |  He wanted a clean sheet the other night, and I think that would be the starting point,
[6391.00 - 6399.00] P:1553.47 E:0.088555 |  but it's been tough, this has been a tough test for England, they've not played well.
[6399.00 - 6406.00] P:1449.68 E:0.089569 |  So Reem did well there, he was under pressure from two England players, Henderson and from Rashford,
[6406.00 - 6412.00] P:1527.29 E:0.097234 |  and it's found its way back to Rashford, and now England on the far side,
[6412.00 - 6417.00] P:1632.04 E:0.102144 |  and a foul as Henderson is sandwiched between two United States players, clever really,
[6417.00 - 6421.00] P:1563.18 E:0.094079 |  won the free-kick, experienced play, and it's a free-kick to England,
[6421.00 - 6424.00] P:1514.42 E:0.092154 |  out there on the far side near the halfway line.
[6424.00 - 6430.00] P:1569.30 E:0.085139 |  Good feet, good skill, good knowledge, just drew the foul from Poulissic, an opportunity,
[6430.00 - 6432.00] P:1582.49 E:0.099756 |  said really old game.
[6432.00 - 6436.00] P:1607.75 E:0.097908 |  Free-kick taken short by England, down the right-hand side, it's chipped across to the back post,
[6436.00 - 6440.00] P:1680.91 E:0.101031 |  Moore comes across and heads it across his own penalty area and behind,
[6440.00 - 6446.00] P:1427.90 E:0.098611 |  and England have a late set-piece in added time.
[6446.00 - 6449.00] P:1485.11 E:0.101311 |  Four minutes of added time.
[6449.00 - 6454.00] P:1407.82 E:0.109432 |  Is that a low cut at the end of a second half for Cata?
[6454.00 - 6461.00] P:1574.58 E:0.100907 |  We had seven subs, 30 seconds per sub, and I must suggest that doesn't leave a lock for anything else.
[6461.00 - 6469.00] P:1620.65 E:0.091669 |  Kona from the right, trippied to take this, so all eyes on Harry Maguire as the obvious target.
[6469.00 - 6476.00] P:1463.82 E:0.087955 |  Harry Kane is complaining that he's already being pulled back, Maguire is standing just beyond the penalty spot,
[6476.00 - 6481.00] P:1318.51 E:0.090332 |  in between the penalty spot and the edge of the area, Trippie is about to take this.
[6481.00 - 6485.00] P:1551.47 E:0.103046 |  Here he is aiming for Maguire, who heads it down but it just bounces up, goalwards,
[6485.00 - 6489.00] P:1738.92 E:0.100399 |  and it's easily caught by a hopping turner above his head.
[6489.00 - 6493.00] P:1705.13 E:0.088174 |  Yeah, it's just a bit too deep, too much pressure on Harry Maguire.
[6493.00 - 6500.00] P:1514.80 E:0.078906 |  They do suffer from set-pieces in USA, but there's been so few of England for England,
[6500.00 - 6505.00] P:1397.45 E:0.083190 |  so little in terms of attacking threat, two corners all game.
[6505.00 - 6511.00] P:1379.04 E:0.085858 |  So it looks like England are going to need something against Wales on Tuesday.
[6511.00 - 6520.00] P:1507.89 E:0.095255 |  Make a note of that in your diary, seven o'clock GMT on Tuesday evening, Wales against England.
[6520.00 - 6526.00] P:1527.36 E:0.090372 |  And Wales will have to win it for England, the draw will do.
[6526.00 - 6529.00] P:1741.74 E:0.102894 |  Grealish, he's lost possession, still time to win this yet.
[6529.00 - 6538.00] P:1682.69 E:0.098032 |  Grealish takes it on downfield, but he is forced wide and then forced over, shoved over, pushed over for a free kick by Moussa.
[6538.00 - 6544.00] P:1617.46 E:0.094045 |  So a free kick, very similar, just a little further on actually to where Luke Shaw had one maybe three or four minutes ago.
[6544.00 - 6550.00] P:1523.22 E:0.094710 |  But this is a good position here for Short, a whip it in, we've seen him do this before, a really good effect.
[6550.00 - 6557.00] P:1415.06 E:0.075484 |  Right, I played a Short one a few moments ago and no real England player in the middle ready.
[6557.00 - 6561.00] P:1476.66 E:0.083557 |  Crossing it to know what this is no such plan.
[6561.00 - 6567.00] P:1473.40 E:0.084028 |  Set it up, get it right, get your big men, far post, McGuire, Stones, waiting.
[6567.00 - 6573.00] P:1603.20 E:0.095709 |  Yep, McGuire just runs his fingers through his jet black hair standing on the far side of the penalty area.
[6573.00 - 6577.00] P:1407.63 E:0.097013 |  He's the furthest man actually, right out on the far side, looking to make the run.
[6577.00 - 6582.00] P:1408.73 E:0.093872 |  Shaw has a look there, one foot in front of the other, White Sox disappearing down his calves.
[6582.00 - 6586.00] P:1494.04 E:0.088309 |  Shaw has a look at the ball, has a look into the middle, still looking into the middle.
[6586.00 - 6591.00] P:1516.98 E:0.084026 |  The referee has just walked all the way across to speak to Harry McGuire.
[6591.00 - 6593.00] P:1446.71 E:0.103752 |  To tell him he stood in an offside position.
[6593.00 - 6595.00] P:1439.63 E:0.082827 |  I think he probably knows that.
[6595.00 - 6597.00] P:1479.58 E:0.101055 |  Shaw, right, he's ready again.
[6597.00 - 6602.00] P:1365.63 E:0.090324 |  Again we see the routine, right arm in the air, McGuire looking to make the run.
[6602.00 - 6605.00] P:1624.19 E:0.097841 |  Shaw plays it in and it's headed White!
[6605.00 - 6609.00] P:1587.98 E:0.100796 |  White by Declan Rice I think it was, in amongst a whole group of players.
[6609.00 - 6615.00] P:1618.67 E:0.088125 |  Kane was in there as well, but that was not far White.
[6616.00 - 6619.00] P:1541.95 E:0.104837 |  And it was the England captain who got his head to it, but White.
[6619.00 - 6625.00] P:1469.61 E:0.078462 |  He's barely had an opportunity all game, one in the first half, one in the second half.
[6625.00 - 6628.00] P:1401.45 E:0.093368 |  It came at him in amongst bodies, in amongst heads.
[6628.00 - 6633.00] P:1435.03 E:0.077356 |  Just mistimed his jump, skewed it wide off his head.
[6633.00 - 6639.00] P:1366.69 E:0.091681 |  That probably is one of two of England's best chances in the whole match.
[6639.00 - 6643.00] P:1619.00 E:0.088793 |  Yeah, Kane with a transferry early on, which was well blocked by Zimmerman actually.
[6643.00 - 6646.00] P:1450.53 E:0.095117 |  He didn't really need to get in credit for that, and that one there.
[6646.00 - 6649.00] P:1502.75 E:0.101235 |  So Kane, yet to get off the mark, rather like the Euros last year.
[6649.00 - 6653.00] P:1618.57 E:0.085235 |  Didn't get into the goals did he, until the knockout stages.
[6653.00 - 6657.00] P:1492.24 E:0.091365 |  England 0, USA 0, long over the halfway line.
[6657.00 - 6662.00] P:1675.94 E:0.099140 |  We're in the final minute of added time now, but we've seen so many late goals.
[6662.00 - 6668.00] P:1738.85 E:0.097661 |  Don't go to bed just yet, as Free-Kick is won by Giovanni Reina.
[6668.00 - 6671.00] P:1636.60 E:0.090017 |  So a Free-Kick for the United States.
[6671.00 - 6677.00] P:1524.66 E:0.093250 |  That is the four minutes up now, but there'll still be time I would think for the USA to take this.
[6677.00 - 6684.00] P:1617.57 E:0.089418 |  If they, if they are able to get this, that would have a dramatic effect on the group.
[6684.00 - 6689.00] P:1622.40 E:0.097656 |  The United States would go from one point to four points, and to top of the table.
[6689.00 - 6694.00] P:1490.07 E:0.094522 |  This will probably be, as they would say, stateside, the last play of the match.
[6694.00 - 6699.00] P:1549.50 E:0.089149 |  Pulisic to take this, rolls it down into the full back position.
[6699.00 - 6703.00] P:1592.51 E:0.090992 |  They need to get it in the box. Reina plays it off Grealish.
[6703.00 - 6707.00] P:1698.23 E:0.091944 |  It's a throw in, still less time to play, no there's not.
[6707.00 - 6710.00] P:1510.89 E:0.102758 |  That's it. What a waste that was by the United States.
[6710.00 - 6715.00] P:1520.66 E:0.098710 |  They should have played it into the penalty area, but that's it on as even.
[6715.00 - 6722.00] P:1483.18 E:0.087306 |  It's a 0-0 draw, and that means this group is going to go down to the final night,
[6722.00 - 6729.00] P:1386.94 E:0.097254 |  when England will play Wales on Tuesday night to decide who goes through to the last 16.
[6729.00 - 6732.00] P:1102.43 E:0.093883 |  Point of peace, 0-0, Rock Green.
[6732.00 - 6736.00] P:1305.02 E:0.101902 |  Really underwhelming, underwhelming performance, underwhelming on the ball.
[6736.00 - 6741.00] P:1265.14 E:0.092365 |  Didn't get it right, quite off the ball. What they did do, England was staying the game.
[6741.00 - 6746.00] P:1311.62 E:0.088287 |  They kept a clean sheet. I think Gareth Southgate would say that's the one positive.
[6746.00 - 6753.00] P:1218.29 E:0.096646 |  Personally, individual performances, defensively, you'd probably say Harry Maguire was the standout player
[6753.00 - 6759.00] P:1212.63 E:0.086188 |  for defensive interceptions. That sums it up. It wasn't great.
[6759.00 - 6763.00] P:1613.03 E:0.091928 |  Relatively few chances really, across the 90 minutes.
[6763.00 - 6768.00] P:1485.67 E:0.091616 |  The United States had so much of the game in the early stages of the second half,
[6768.00 - 6773.00] P:1366.82 E:0.082345 |  but Jordan Tickford had relatively little to do, if we're talking about goalkeepers making save.
[6773.00 - 6778.00] P:1240.49 E:0.098273 |  They flipped that round and Matt Ryan had the one saving the first half,
[6778.00 - 6781.00] P:1270.91 E:0.075787 |  which was a good save from Mason Mount.
[6781.00 - 6787.00] P:1331.17 E:0.098122 |  Looking at it to say, well, there just wasn't the quality in the game.
[6787.00 - 6794.00] P:1377.03 E:0.095638 |  That may be suited the USA. That may be suited the way that they play, the chaotic nature of it,
[6794.00 - 6797.00] P:1205.70 E:0.094671 |  but even still, they couldn't find the quality.
[6797.00 - 6801.00] P:1412.94 E:0.100438 |  England will pick the pieces out of this. They'll go again against Wales.
[6801.00 - 6807.00] P:1337.71 E:0.099787 |  It probably doesn't suit Wales at all in any shape or form, but it keeps us interested.
[6807.00 - 6809.00] P:1200.44 E:0.104271 |  It keeps it close to that final game.
[6809.00 - 6812.00] P:1324.15 E:0.094972 |  So there we are in the group. It's 4-3-2-1 now.
[6812.00 - 6814.00] P:1498.53 E:0.097726 |  England 4 points.
[6814.00 - 6821.00] P:1342.39 E:0.104203 |  The round 3, USA 2, Wales 1. That's the way it stands after two matches in Group B.
[6821.00 - 6828.00] P:1450.66 E:0.103573 |  And it's back down to earth for England after the sparkling record-breaking opening against Iran.
[6828.00 - 6831.00] P:1458.79 E:0.105079 |  Just like the Euros last year, second group match.
[6831.00 - 6836.00] P:1234.24 E:0.105954 |  0-0 draw. England 0, USA 0.
[6836.00 - 6838.00] P:1421.92 E:0.090408 |  And here is Kelly Cates.
[6838.00 - 6845.00] P:1340.32 E:0.115676 |  Loud boos at the final whistle, and it might be the only boos these England fans get this evening here in Qatar.
