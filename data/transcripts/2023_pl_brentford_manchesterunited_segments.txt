[0.00 - 6.24] P:1544.50 E:0.069808 |  And proving that not everything that 74 years old has to be removed from sports report. Here's John Murray
[8.04 - 13.88] P:1634.97 E:0.108173 |  Very good very good. Well, I'm pleased to hear we've kept ourselves sense of humor anyway
[14.48 - 21.98] P:1764.12 E:0.102929 |  And there is the whistle for the start of Brentford against Manchester United in the Premier League in the sunshine
[22.32 - 28.48] P:1815.45 E:0.102007 |  Here in Brentford's community stadium the GTEC community stadium as it is now
[29.08 - 31.24] P:1707.27 E:0.090463 |  And we are we are absolutely
[31.64 - 37.76] P:1701.00 E:0.109827 |  Swell-tied and when I say we I mean Glenn Murray who's sitting next to me Premier League goal scorer with Crystal Palace and
[38.00 - 42.24] P:1714.95 E:0.103545 |  Bournemouth and Brighton and this has the feel Glenn of a very big game
[42.68 - 48.68] P:1625.81 E:0.101590 |  Yes, especially for one side and that's eyes Manchester United Brentford have got a free hit here at a huge club
[48.68 - 51.00] P:1663.98 E:0.096541 |  And I'm sure inside that Brentford dressing room
[51.00 - 56.76] P:1582.97 E:0.102298 |  They will fancy their chances this afternoon as we see Manchester United being patient with their build-up
[56.76 - 62.68] P:1769.61 E:0.103381 |  Yes, they're playing from right to left in the first half and Brentford now just clearing the ball away
[62.68 - 67.16] P:1865.52 E:0.091173 |  Red and white striped shirts for the bees black shorts red and white socks
[67.36 - 72.72] P:1701.32 E:0.099487 |  Ben me just heading the ball forward near the edge of his own penalty area and Brentford then going all the way back to
[72.72 - 79.68] P:1789.01 E:0.104010 |  Goalkeeper David Ryder. They've made two changes Thomas Frank their manager from the the opening match the 2-2 draw
[79.76 - 83.52] P:1717.66 E:0.096555 |  Against Leicester last weekend the comeback match more on that in a moment
[83.56 - 90.52] P:1782.28 E:0.108961 |  Rashford now playing the ball through the middle to Christiano Ronaldo who goes down Henry in with a challenge just outside the penalty area
[90.52 - 95.52] P:1802.60 E:0.109453 |  It was in the D by the time that he fell referee Stuart at well immediately says nothing doing
[95.64 - 102.24] P:1781.99 E:0.105725 |  No free kick on the edge of the box booze from the home supporters for Christiano Ronaldo for the way that he went down Glenn
[102.72 - 106.94] P:1580.65 E:0.099514 |  Yes, I have to agree with Stuart out. Well, he's gone down in installments there John
[107.20 - 112.96] P:1488.27 E:0.099083 |  The bar has been set a lot higher this season as we've seen from the referees and that is not gonna warrant a free kick
[112.96 - 118.88] P:1669.51 E:0.098488 |  This season however a moment of alarm for Brentford and Rashford providing the ball through
[119.00 - 125.24] P:1674.42 E:0.096609 |  So Brentford with Ryder in goal three central defenders then as United played the ball over the top
[125.24 - 127.96] P:1684.34 E:0.092158 |  But that's headed away on the edge of the box by
[128.60 - 131.36] P:1500.99 E:0.107379 |  Pontus Jansen and United go back to the halfway line
[131.36 - 138.28] P:1741.21 E:0.096219 |  So the three central defenders Roos left coming into the team Jansen and me Hickey on the right Henry on the left and then in the
[138.28 - 141.68] P:1668.13 E:0.102154 |  middle no garden Jensen Josh De Silva Brian and Burma and
[142.44 - 149.52] P:1785.40 E:0.105728 |  Ivan Tony up front and Manchester United just the one change and that is Christiano Ronaldo coming in to start
[149.64 - 156.40] P:1743.92 E:0.094279 |  For the first time this season now fully fit was able to play only a minimal part in United's preseason
[156.68 - 158.84] P:1624.81 E:0.102814 |  So he's in Scott McTominay is on the bench
[158.92 - 161.98] P:1629.99 E:0.103072 |  So to here in goal a back four of Daloh, Maguire,
[162.72 - 166.56] P:1691.99 E:0.103541 |  Martinez and Shaw there was speculation that there would be a change at the back
[166.56 - 172.94] P:1722.67 E:0.092247 |  But not so in midfield Fred Bruno Fernandez and Christian Ericsson back here at the club
[172.94 - 175.40] P:1732.72 E:0.108247 |  Where he made his comeback last season there were some booze
[175.40 - 178.32] P:1814.01 E:0.103189 |  It was a mixed reception when his name was read out pre-match and
[178.84 - 181.84] P:1697.93 E:0.114980 |  Sanchez and Rashford in the wider positions and Ronaldo through the middle
[181.88 - 184.88] P:1899.19 E:0.099860 |  So this United attack comes to an end on
[185.28 - 191.24] P:1695.77 E:0.094574 |  Brentford in Brentford's left back position and it is a free kick that Ben me will take
[191.80 - 193.12] P:1682.59 E:0.084662 |  so
[193.12 - 200.16] P:1748.21 E:0.098960 |  Here we are live Premier League football in the unlikely event you've not heard the Saturday 5 30 Premier League kickoff is a
[200.16 - 205.96] P:1783.09 E:0.106043 |  Commentary match now on five live and BBC sounds for the foreseeable future for the the next three years at least
[206.36 - 208.36] P:1656.60 E:0.096598 |  And this is being played
[208.68 - 214.06] P:1705.78 E:0.103292 |  In a terrific atmosphere swirling around the stadium even though the capacity here is less than
[214.28 - 217.56] P:1756.06 E:0.099052 |  20,000 big shots for Ivan Tony who went down under the challenge
[217.56 - 223.08] P:1744.96 E:0.096811 |  But no free kick and United moving it through the middle Bruno Fernandez Christiano Ronaldo tries to shop from
[223.08 - 228.12] P:1743.96 E:0.105914 |  Way way out on the right-hand side, but it bounces in front of Ryan who's able to fall forward and grab it into his chest
[228.52 - 234.00] P:1636.17 E:0.093753 |  Yes, Ryan collected that very well because the way that Christiano Ronaldo struck that ball
[234.00 - 238.20] P:1543.58 E:0.093493 |  It was wicked it bounced about three four foot just in front of the goalkeeper and skipped up off the turf
[238.20 - 241.64] P:1513.52 E:0.094078 |  But his hands were nice and clean brilliant start by Manchester United
[241.92 - 248.04] P:1486.92 E:0.093241 |  There's a lot of anticipation around the Brentford stadium tonight that they would come and they would get a result
[248.04 - 252.56] P:1569.10 E:0.103998 |  But Manchester United have come out and started this game fantastically well ball forward
[252.56 - 257.64] P:1788.51 E:0.109873 |  For Burma to to make the run across the back line. It was Ivan Tony
[257.64 - 259.84] P:1907.54 E:0.112427 |  That's going to be a feature today Glenn to see how
[260.60 - 264.64] P:1746.03 E:0.102317 |  Uncomfortable Ivan Tony makes this from a choir and Martinez. Yes, that's funny
[264.64 - 268.20] P:1505.02 E:0.100815 |  You've mentioned that so early John because that's the first thing at the top of my notes
[268.76 - 271.32] P:1688.00 E:0.096378 |  Martinez and Tony battle. I know that
[272.12 - 275.92] P:1555.83 E:0.088827 |  Brentford and Ivan Tony will have watched last week's game the
[276.20 - 280.44] P:1520.69 E:0.098627 |  Manchester United versus Brighton game and that is a big talking point Martinez his height
[280.48 - 284.36] P:1500.99 E:0.103083 |  Will be pulling on to me and he will be asking questions all afternoon
[284.36 - 290.68] P:1614.10 E:0.095298 |  Yeah, it you know, I'd heard that he wasn't the tallest and you can never really tell it until you see someone in the flesh
[290.88 - 294.38] P:1688.43 E:0.099160 |  But it is really quite striking when you see him on the field there
[294.38 - 300.84] P:1866.64 E:0.103298 |  He's he's way short of six feet to throw them one of Brentford's long throws into the penalty area. It's rattling around inside the United
[300.84 - 302.84] P:1751.95 E:0.099772 |  Box, it's still in play and then with
[303.76 - 306.16] P:1797.31 E:0.121452 |  No guard the closest arriving to it
[306.20 - 311.08] P:1784.64 E:0.106665 |  Was stabbed behind by combination of Ericsson and Martinez it's a corner to Brentford
[311.28 - 316.24] P:1549.20 E:0.096955 |  Yes, it was classic pinball in the middle of the box then he just wouldn't sit kindly enough for a Brentford player
[316.24 - 317.96] P:1532.16 E:0.103428 |  And it is Ericsson your right
[317.96 - 324.72] P:1534.37 E:0.089724 |  He just comes across and stabs it out of play for a Brentford corner. It was the long throw from Matthias Jensen
[325.68 - 331.72] P:1671.72 E:0.102599 |  Takes me back to the first match here of last season when Brentford made their return to the Premier League and an unsettled
[331.72 - 337.56] P:1799.39 E:0.093520 |  Arsenal with the long throws but it's a corner now from the right and Bermont and Jensen are there
[337.56 - 342.16] P:1710.63 E:0.102169 |  It looks as though it's going to be in Bermont. It is left footed to the near post that's headed away
[342.16 - 344.60] P:1739.30 E:0.111572 |  It was Cristiano Ronaldo Henry arrives on it
[344.60 - 350.16] P:1880.19 E:0.101508 |  But he snatched at the shot though defenders arriving and he hit it wildly actually and it hit the
[351.04 - 354.04] P:1629.06 E:0.087782 |  Advertising hoardings halfway up the stand to our right. Yes
[354.04 - 358.76] P:1586.27 E:0.095428 |  I think he saw his his naming light as he approached that ball then he just lost his composure
[358.76 - 361.24] P:1387.18 E:0.094614 |  And it goes high into the stand behind the goal
[362.24 - 366.88] P:1679.47 E:0.100095 |  So it's five live BBC sounds Brentford Nail Manchester United Nail
[367.00 - 369.48] P:1788.85 E:0.092799 |  there'll be more reaction interviews and
[370.08 - 376.04] P:1720.12 E:0.093221 |  And a full roundup again on all of the significant events this afternoon up and down the country
[376.08 - 379.60] P:1671.26 E:0.094999 |  not just in the footballing world but in the sporting world as well and
[380.20 - 382.04] P:1666.09 E:0.113834 |  Mention of that reminds me to
[382.04 - 387.36] P:1705.28 E:0.101964 |  To tell you that you can listen to commentary on the hundred right now on sports extra
[387.64 - 392.40] P:1847.39 E:0.098990 |  Live from Cardiff, but it is a throwing for Manchester United sure
[392.80 - 399.20] P:1614.88 E:0.097874 |  Takes the throw he gets it back from Ronaldo long long high left footed ball looking for Jaden Sancho
[399.84 - 401.84] P:1588.38 E:0.095852 |  Manchester United in this
[401.84 - 404.84] P:1632.04 E:0.090862 |  This change kid of to sort of yellowy
[405.48 - 408.64] P:1616.93 E:0.105629 |  Yellowy grits feels like it's got a green tinge to it as well
[409.12 - 413.68] P:1530.48 E:0.108480 |  Fernandez playing the ball out towards the right-hand side Sanchez is there Cristian Ericsson. Well, there are the booze
[414.24 - 419.76] P:1547.96 E:0.093862 |  Cristian Ericsson that's Paul from the Brentford fans. I feel yeah, well here. He is again made his comeback here
[420.20 - 423.16] P:1746.21 E:0.112115 |  Brentford Thomas Frank brought him here. This is obviously after
[423.92 - 424.72] P:1677.61 E:0.104012 |  the
[424.72 - 431.68] P:1787.52 E:0.099669 |  The incident when he collapsed at the euros in Copenhagen as Luke Shaw is impeded for a high foot
[432.04 - 438.20] P:1620.39 E:0.094010 |  And it's a free kick to Brentford the challenge on Aaron Hickey the right wing back as he is in this match so far
[438.20 - 442.36] P:1666.33 E:0.090091 |  And it's a free kick to Brentford point being I think some of the Brentford supporters
[442.96 - 444.44] P:1669.10 E:0.083610 |  Felt that
[444.44 - 448.60] P:1633.10 E:0.096725 |  You know, they would have liked to have seen him repay the faith that he had in them
[448.72 - 453.56] P:1550.97 E:0.088505 |  But you know, I think the other side of that is for Cristian Ericsson with everything that's happened to him
[453.56 - 458.72] P:1618.11 E:0.099274 |  The fact that he's 30 years old now gets the chance to go to Manchester United on a three-year contract
[459.08 - 463.64] P:1523.49 E:0.107257 |  Yes, it's a huge opportunity. It's very naive of the supporters to boo him
[463.64 - 470.12] P:1673.24 E:0.094877 |  I think they should be appreciative that they've seen him play for the club and do so well because I think it was a huge plus in keeping them
[470.16 - 474.32] P:1611.37 E:0.096521 |  Open that link with Tony that they created at the end of last season. So for them to boo him
[474.32 - 475.92] P:1679.02 E:0.111914 |  I think it's really poor
[475.92 - 477.92] P:1764.12 E:0.108678 |  Foul on Hickey from Ronaldo
[478.68 - 484.00] P:1654.72 E:0.103720 |  Who looks less than impressed that just down in front of us here Hickey went down just a tub by Ronaldo
[484.00 - 489.88] P:1631.32 E:0.086534 |  Purse lips from him and he walks past referee at well, and it's a free kick
[490.28 - 492.28] P:1654.05 E:0.085880 |  I'm just chuckling because
[492.32 - 498.52] P:1603.11 E:0.098537 |  Just as kickoff was approaching the Sun came around the side of the stand. So it is now blazing on us
[499.28 - 504.60] P:1492.08 E:0.097999 |  We are really struggling to see this TV that's in front of us. So didn't have a chance to see
[505.64 - 510.72] P:1495.59 E:0.102534 |  How how serious that challenge was by Ronaldo or otherwise other than by the naked eye
[510.80 - 513.84] P:1820.69 E:0.088510 |  So it's a free kick anyway down in front of us that
[514.92 - 517.32] P:1759.89 E:0.111977 |  Manchester United are holding an extremely high line
[517.56 - 522.78] P:1594.96 E:0.092687 |  eight and nine yards outside their penalty area and it's played square by Jensen then
[523.20 - 525.86] P:1737.97 E:0.106072 |  No guard lifted over the top good intention
[525.86 - 528.10] P:1528.58 E:0.107732 |  He was looking for the run of them Burma, but no guard
[528.54 - 534.66] P:1646.60 E:0.094121 |  Just overheated and it bounced harmlessly through from Manchester United goal kick and it's Brentford Neil Manchester United Neil
[534.66 - 535.98] P:1559.79 E:0.085610 |  And this is Glenn Murray
[535.98 - 539.14] P:1463.96 E:0.091884 |  That little triangle there that was straight from the training ground wasn't it?
[539.14 - 543.58] P:1535.25 E:0.091815 |  He did everyone was a square ball out to no guard who tried to find when Buehmoy
[543.70 - 547.42] P:1724.11 E:0.104240 |  He just made a run behind the Manchester United defense, but
[548.02 - 553.38] P:1676.12 E:0.109371 |  The pass just was a little bit overheated wasn't it? Glenn Manchester United are trying to play up from the back again
[553.70 - 555.70] P:1625.85 E:0.082122 |  Ball ends up with McGuire
[555.90 - 557.66] P:1656.34 E:0.064385 |  and
[557.66 - 559.66] P:1578.60 E:0.090272 |  And they were all over him
[560.42 - 561.78] P:1601.43 E:0.085978 |  Brentford
[561.78 - 568.54] P:1706.91 E:0.102380 |  And he was he was able to win a throw in by deflecting it off the Brentford player Cristiano Ronaldo goes down
[569.22 - 571.22] P:1769.97 E:0.109418 |  Brentford come forward now a low shot
[573.22 - 581.62] P:1819.62 E:0.111911 |  It's gone in oh my goodness Josh De Silva from 20 yards, but De here should have saved it
[582.54 - 587.10] P:1823.66 E:0.115618 |  Routine saved down to his left is squirmed through his hands into the bottom corner
[587.50 - 592.62] P:1742.43 E:0.112599 |  That is a nightmare again for Manchester United again for David here
[592.62 - 596.94] P:1787.02 E:0.114702 |  And after his opening defeat in his first Premier League match at Old Trafford
[597.14 - 603.62] P:1735.68 E:0.111101 |  Eric Tenhard sees his team go one nil down here after ten minutes with a goal like that
[604.34 - 608.62] P:1777.94 E:0.109090 |  Brentford one Manchester United Neil and that's two in two for Josh De Silva
[609.18 - 614.06] P:1633.00 E:0.104114 |  Hence my reaction as it slipped in through De Hayes hands or no slipped out of my mouth
[614.06 - 616.46] P:1531.18 E:0.115745 |  I couldn't believe it looked like it saved the ball already
[616.62 - 618.46] P:1692.56 E:0.106772 |  He had both pounds behind it
[618.46 - 622.58] P:1683.84 E:0.101104 |  But it just slipped off and rolled into the back of the net for her
[622.78 - 629.94] P:1579.14 E:0.103111 |  horrendous error from the Spanish goalkeeper the Manchester United number one as I see Fred just go over to him and give him a
[629.94 - 632.38] P:1563.67 E:0.103897 |  Little bit of a cuddle a little bit of a pep talk
[632.90 - 638.60] P:1496.07 E:0.102607 |  The one thing that you've got to take from this right now from a Manchester United perspective is there's time to get back
[638.62 - 643.08] P:1599.71 E:0.101572 |  In this game but as far as Brentford are concerned. What a fantastic start to the game
[644.30 - 647.50] P:1658.37 E:0.101474 |  Well, you know, it might be a new start
[647.50 - 651.82] P:1649.48 E:0.096048 |  It might be a new story as Eric Tenhard said in these
[652.26 - 656.34] P:1696.23 E:0.107576 |  Program notes at Old Trafford last weekend, but it really feels like we've seen all this before
[656.34 - 660.06] P:1793.28 E:0.101842 |  But look sure is carrying the ball up towards the edge of the penalty area and now
[660.38 - 663.50] P:1712.00 E:0.113097 |  Fernandez arriving on the edge of the box hits a shot high over the top
[663.54 - 670.30] P:1640.40 E:0.110161 |  But Cristiano Ronaldo went down early and they in that move. I don't know whether he was caught after the ball had gone
[671.54 - 672.82] P:1664.88 E:0.088660 |  Well
[672.82 - 677.38] P:1654.84 E:0.103885 |  He went down, but now he's back up on his feet. It looked for a moment just thought
[678.22 - 682.58] P:1658.84 E:0.110348 |  You know, he was in some serious pain there, but he has got back to his feet quite quickly
[682.58 - 686.44] P:1479.80 E:0.113196 |  I thought for a moment it really hurt himself because it was theatrical, but he's open
[686.44 - 689.46] P:1518.35 E:0.115041 |  He's absolutely fine, but there's Manchester United their best one twos
[690.46 - 695.24] P:1548.68 E:0.107925 |  Luke Shaw going right through the heart of the Brentford defense and gets laid back to
[695.54 - 700.38] P:1577.05 E:0.109901 |  Fernandez very similar to an opportunity had against Brighton at Old Trafford last week and again
[701.14 - 707.70] P:1617.50 E:0.102153 |  Miss miss times the shot and put it over the bar, but Bruno Fernandez will be disappointed with that flowing move for United though
[707.90 - 713.78] P:1649.37 E:0.098078 |  Fernandez to Sancho on the right hand side, but his low crosses blocked Brentford were quickly back in there in numbers
[713.82 - 716.14] P:1622.30 E:0.095954 |  You have to give them credit in this sweltering heat
[716.46 - 720.96] P:1711.67 E:0.097733 |  Very early stages still deep cross to the back post Hickey gets under it Rashford
[721.14 - 728.02] P:1691.85 E:0.088691 |  It was thinking about allowing it to bounce out of play, but he's kept it in kept possession Rashford now back centrally to
[728.34 - 737.06] P:1687.76 E:0.095698 |  Martinez and then to the left-hand side to Shaw, but Manchester United still shaken by the way that they've conceded that opening goal
[738.02 - 740.70] P:1577.68 E:0.092470 |  David to here hanging his head. I mean
[741.38 - 743.78] P:1613.38 E:0.100343 |  He goes from the brilliant to
[744.62 - 749.98] P:1637.05 E:0.095131 |  Moments like that that happened to him on a on a two-frequent basis really. Yeah, I mean
[750.98 - 753.06] P:1598.04 E:0.106117 |  As far as Eric ten hugs concern
[753.06 - 755.86] P:1429.00 E:0.112747 |  I mean he is one player that you think you can rely on and he's
[755.98 - 757.62] P:1544.08 E:0.112958 |  He's an elder statement at the scope
[757.62 - 764.22] P:1539.82 E:0.102373 |  I'm just looking John as we both sat in here sat here in our caps watching this game and the Sun is directly in David
[764.22 - 769.34] P:1563.87 E:0.109445 |  Hey, is eyes and I wonder why he hasn't got a cap on and if that had a point to play in the goal
[770.02 - 774.38] P:1694.95 E:0.097568 |  Popside flag against Marcus Rashford, so it's a free kick to Brentford
[775.02 - 778.52] P:1867.80 E:0.103518 |  But but I mean it was it was quite a low shot
[779.42 - 783.34] P:1655.96 E:0.105293 |  But I see what you're saying whether there was a moment of being dazzled in the midst of that
[783.34 - 787.90] P:1471.32 E:0.090284 |  I mean, it's directly in front in the Sun and it's in it's beating down on him and I just wonder
[787.90 - 792.46] P:1462.96 E:0.099078 |  Why not have a hat on just for that extra bit of security, you know, I think that's a great point
[793.54 - 797.42] P:1545.64 E:0.092866 |  So David to here and he diving down to his left as I said at the time
[797.46 - 802.18] P:1705.50 E:0.101483 |  Looked like a routine save just to silver on his right foot round about 20 yards out
[802.54 - 803.94] P:1627.40 E:0.094793 |  Hit it well enough
[803.94 - 808.06] P:1661.54 E:0.105194 |  The scrambling down his left just slipped through his hands and into the bottom corner
[808.06 - 813.10] P:1627.79 E:0.098617 |  It was almost as if he felt as though he'd already made the save and that he was moving on to the next action
[813.10 - 815.38] P:1498.33 E:0.096134 |  And was looking where he was going to pass the ball next
[816.98 - 820.96] P:1563.26 E:0.097892 |  But you know what I mean, it feels like in it's the same old problems
[821.42 - 824.94] P:1578.37 E:0.097489 |  You know, if it's not one thing with Manchester United, it's another
[825.34 - 830.18] P:1732.09 E:0.102079 |  But taking that one error and you can't you can I mean it's an individual error that you can't
[830.70 - 836.02] P:1599.93 E:0.095507 |  No thing for me. Yeah, it's just one of those Manchester United start of this game has been very good
[836.02 - 838.44] P:1676.98 E:0.091339 |  They look much better than last week agreed
[838.90 - 844.10] P:1756.87 E:0.104179 |  Here is De Silva Brentford's goal scorer two goals in two matches great story
[844.34 - 848.14] P:1695.78 E:0.093437 |  Low cross into the penalty area cleared away by Martinez with his right foot
[848.62 - 850.62] P:1723.04 E:0.101783 |  just to silver who had these
[851.30 - 855.02] P:1600.37 E:0.111891 |  These injury problems the hip injury and here now in Burma
[855.02 - 859.50] P:1467.08 E:0.098187 |  Hitting a shot but straight into McGuire on the edge of the box and then Martin as is able to head it away
[859.90 - 864.74] P:1702.42 E:0.103425 |  Comes out to Jensen turns the full 360 degrees gives it to Hickey
[864.74 - 869.78] P:1780.50 E:0.100876 |  Now the ball to the right-hand side to silver in the box on the left plays it across. It's half cleared
[869.78 - 875.74] P:1734.14 E:0.098268 |  But then a foul by no guard on the edge of the area and a free kick to Manchester United
[875.74 - 879.90] P:1840.02 E:0.111052 |  But yes, you're right Glenn, you know, we've seen some flowing moves from Manchester United
[880.02 - 882.18] P:1803.48 E:0.099668 |  Already in the match not 15 minutes play
[882.94 - 885.14] P:1768.51 E:0.109070 |  Unfortunately the damning fact is they're one nil down
[885.14 - 888.82] P:1475.60 E:0.095351 |  I mean even though Brentford are leading this game one no with 14 minutes into the game
[888.82 - 892.06] P:1540.80 E:0.097181 |  And that's the first bit of possession they've had anywhere neither Manchester United
[892.62 - 897.50] P:1541.43 E:0.103775 |  18 year box and justice elbow was he was the main part of it again playing it across and
[897.78 - 899.90] P:1607.63 E:0.101788 |  Look if much tonight they managed to get rid of it
[899.90 - 905.78] P:1613.90 E:0.084208 |  But that's the best little pattern of play Brent Nevaad Brentford have had so far Brentford won
[906.34 - 909.02] P:1650.93 E:0.093848 |  Manchester United nil that is the
[909.26 - 912.96] P:1674.91 E:0.091301 |  The score line here a goalkeeping error by David Dehaer
[913.22 - 920.02] P:1677.55 E:0.097348 |  Josh the silver shot slipping into the bottom corner and you can hear the crowd getting on it to here as the ball is passed back to him
[920.38 - 926.70] P:1758.52 E:0.100863 |  So so last weekend last Sunday you might have heard it on five live in Eric Tenhards first Premier League match
[926.70 - 933.18] P:1707.60 E:0.111374 |  They lose to Brentford for the first time and now they failed to clear and then Harry McGuire puts the challenge in in the D
[934.02 - 937.54] P:1747.27 E:0.109944 |  It's a free kick and it's a yellow card
[937.86 - 942.26] P:1740.60 E:0.108195 |  Well, there's a moment there. I did wonder whether there might have been a case for a red
[942.26 - 943.74] P:1767.00 E:0.075411 |  I think
[943.74 - 947.74] P:1688.02 E:0.100810 |  Quite correctly the point was made that the ball was running across the penalty area
[947.74 - 951.78] P:1649.26 E:0.096820 |  I think that might have saved McGuire there yellow card for the Manchester United captain
[951.86 - 956.02] P:1544.93 E:0.099922 |  Yes, there was a recovering defender that can't quite make out who it was on the screen
[956.14 - 961.30] P:1614.15 E:0.095292 |  But for me it's a bad pass from the wise to begin with it gives it to Ericsson who's under a lot of pressure
[961.34 - 967.50] P:1645.82 E:0.095639 |  Tries to play the ball round the corner facing his own goal that gets cut out and all of a sudden Brentford are on the attack
[967.50 - 973.50] P:1636.44 E:0.089680 |  And it leads to Harry McGuire having to make a last-ditch challenge. It's bad play by Manchester United
[974.38 - 980.70] P:1635.68 E:0.093615 |  Dennis Brentford. I mean this is a free kick in the D slightly left of centre near the middle of the D
[981.18 - 983.90] P:1619.79 E:0.088791 |  The Brentford can get a second goal now in this match
[984.58 - 989.30] P:1550.63 E:0.094433 |  I'd be very interested to see how these Manchester United players reacted to that absolutely
[989.54 - 997.14] P:1624.09 E:0.091920 |  And Bermol standing to the right of the ball and the Manchester United wall that yellowy-green wall
[1000.06 - 1006.30] P:1722.56 E:0.095302 |  Three four five Manchester United players in there a couple of Brentford players as well and
[1010.82 - 1012.82] P:1784.85 E:0.115266 |  The free kick is ready to be taken
[1013.42 - 1021.34] P:1686.33 E:0.090488 |  They've got a man lying down behind the wall as well. It's hit up and over the top of the crossbar
[1022.58 - 1024.58] P:1857.29 E:0.104331 |  harmlessly away
[1026.06 - 1027.58] P:1570.74 E:0.125632 |  That wasn't very far away
[1027.58 - 1028.78] P:1605.77 E:0.106789 |  It's just got open over the wall
[1028.78 - 1032.74] P:1515.64 E:0.096765 |  He couldn't quite get the dip on it and he goes over the uncovered side of the goal
[1032.74 - 1038.14] P:1572.15 E:0.087277 |  But if I was Thomas Frank the one message I would have been getting on to the field of play there will be
[1038.18 - 1045.02] P:1553.73 E:0.092874 |  Hit it on target ask questions of David Dehaia especially after just what happened. Yeah, Jensen with the free kick
[1045.02 - 1047.86] P:1816.97 E:0.112080 |  Oh Jensen's run the ball back in the area shoots low
[1050.06 - 1054.46] P:1821.53 E:0.117329 |  Christian Ericsson was caught in possession inside his own penalty area
[1054.46 - 1059.66] P:1869.93 E:0.112247 |  He presented it to Matias Jensen and his fellow Dain said thank you very much
[1059.66 - 1067.54] P:1795.72 E:0.112214 |  And with his right foot buried it into the empty net and Brentford celebrate a second goal and Manchester United's players are looking
[1067.58 - 1070.34] P:1808.71 E:0.103409 |  Gag as a one another well, it's happening again
[1070.78 - 1078.14] P:1809.05 E:0.110167 |  Eric Tenhardt stands down on the touchline and again last week in the first half his team were 2-0 down to Brighton
[1078.14 - 1080.74] P:1856.66 E:0.102833 |  This week the 2-0 down to Brentford
[1080.98 - 1087.38] P:1720.17 E:0.103085 |  And he stands on the edge of the pitch there and I can just see the slight shake of their head and the wave of the arm
[1087.38 - 1088.90] P:1576.78 E:0.102843 |  He is not very happy
[1088.90 - 1093.30] P:1688.40 E:0.101876 |  But Manchester United are causing their own problems again only one minute ago
[1093.30 - 1097.22] P:1602.90 E:0.104585 |  We said about McGuire giving the ball to Ericsson in playing a blind pass around the corner
[1097.34 - 1101.66] P:1692.69 E:0.104246 |  He does it again Ericsson's always gonna show for the ball to give an option
[1101.66 - 1108.02] P:1546.46 E:0.106137 |  But the passes and on the players need to realize that he gives it away in his own 80 yard books and Jensen
[1109.14 - 1112.66] P:1478.45 E:0.116345 |  Capitalizes rules it in to the bottom right hand corner of Dehaia's net
[1113.18 - 1118.02] P:1574.65 E:0.104188 |  Manchester United causing their own problems again in this game not 20 minutes played
[1119.14 - 1122.02] P:1721.38 E:0.107100 |  Brentford to Manchester United nil
[1122.02 - 1128.94] P:1593.19 E:0.089930 |  Extraordinary really what a start for Eric Tenhardt
[1129.50 - 1134.74] P:1662.30 E:0.101953 |  The last Manchester United manager to lose his first two competitive matches
[1135.70 - 1137.88] P:1681.24 E:0.098714 |  was John Chapman in
[1139.50 - 1141.50] P:1847.76 E:0.082093 |  1921 and
[1141.54 - 1146.78] P:1742.86 E:0.112791 |  Manchester United finished bottom and were relegated that season he has some Burma taking the ball away
[1146.90 - 1151.18] P:1758.96 E:0.105567 |  But he ran it out of play after the challenge didn't he man he beat the
[1151.18 - 1156.14] P:1594.09 E:0.106695 |  I thought it was just over played did you think not that was very very tight from where we sat John?
[1156.14 - 1158.14] P:1643.74 E:0.090417 |  I think I think that's very
[1158.54 - 1160.34] P:1697.21 E:0.094123 |  beneficial for the
[1160.34 - 1165.22] P:1616.57 E:0.104996 |  Defensive side of Manchester United that a Burma was away if that call wasn't made
[1165.22 - 1168.06] P:1642.01 E:0.106545 |  I would like to see a replay well the assistant ruled it
[1168.58 - 1172.82] P:1722.98 E:0.093271 |  That it had crossed the line. It was touching girl remains to nil
[1173.26 - 1177.70] P:1436.54 E:0.105328 |  But I mean so can you tell me why that wasn't ran on and look back at VA afterwards?
[1177.70 - 1183.86] P:1579.77 E:0.100378 |  I think they did I think they'd oh because that's not and you can't look at that. That's one of those incidents one of the key
[1184.58 - 1186.58] P:1634.31 E:0.112916 |  one of the key four
[1186.66 - 1188.66] P:1612.76 E:0.084778 |  areas that you
[1188.70 - 1191.46] P:1384.59 E:0.097079 |  That that wasn't one of them ball out on the touch line
[1191.94 - 1197.70] P:1574.26 E:0.096598 |  Here come Manchester United on the on the right hand side and now they've got to come from two nil down
[1197.74 - 1203.58] P:1627.77 E:0.101575 |  And even though there were promising early signs Cristiano Ronaldo now hits a shot on the edge of the penalty area
[1203.58 - 1208.50] P:1694.52 E:0.104216 |  But it flies up and away over the top by three or four yards never threatened David Ryers goal
[1208.70 - 1213.92] P:1727.01 E:0.094173 |  But I mean honestly clan I almost can't believe what I'm saying here after last week
[1214.46 - 1218.66] P:1545.38 E:0.096283 |  To see what what Brighton did so well we should say against Manchester United
[1219.26 - 1224.46] P:1622.38 E:0.087247 |  But to implode like this those two goals at this level
[1225.18 - 1226.78] P:1466.14 E:0.070741 |  aha
[1226.86 - 1233.14] P:1444.53 E:0.092876 |  Acceptable. Yeah, you're right. It is unacceptable, but the crazy thing is coming into the game today
[1233.14 - 1235.70] P:1505.07 E:0.106444 |  I really did believe Brentford could get something out of this game
[1235.70 - 1239.58] P:1536.92 E:0.101317 |  I didn't think the future me look so early on in the game, but
[1240.18 - 1245.10] P:1526.77 E:0.095164 |  They've caused their own problems Manchester United apart from those two mistakes. They've played quite well
[1245.10 - 1248.26] P:1591.06 E:0.092203 |  I mean it sounds crazy, but Rashford's been quite bright
[1250.58 - 1252.58] P:1432.86 E:0.106570 |  That sounds a little bit like the old
[1253.62 - 1256.38] P:1463.24 E:0.111278 |  Abraham Lincoln doesn't it when he was assassinated and the
[1256.82 - 1262.14] P:1526.71 E:0.099992 |  Theater and they said but apart from everything else Mrs. Lincoln. How did you enjoy the play?
[1264.38 - 1266.06] P:1576.41 E:0.110918 |  Throw in Shaw
[1266.06 - 1268.58] P:1304.11 E:0.095153 |  Takes it Ronaldo inside his own half
[1268.58 - 1275.58] P:1554.28 E:0.095088 |  There is space on the far side and Ronaldo finds it and Dallow is able to stretch his legs open his legs move into
[1275.58 - 1276.58] P:1666.13 E:0.093515 |  Brentford territory
[1276.58 - 1279.58] P:1811.73 E:0.094965 |  But if you've just switched onto a certain five live if you've been at a match
[1280.02 - 1281.82] P:1703.55 E:0.094553 |  Manchester United are two nil down
[1281.82 - 1288.94] P:1693.29 E:0.088283 |  Shaw now crossing from the left-hand side Henry gets up to head that away comes out for United again and now
[1288.94 - 1291.98] P:1739.58 E:0.103794 |  Well, the ball is played low across the penalty area
[1292.50 - 1298.10] P:1715.43 E:0.103941 |  But Brentford are able to block that and clear it up towards the halfway line and you can hear the reaction
[1298.10 - 1300.34] P:1597.37 E:0.098970 |  Harry McGuire when he's on the ball
[1300.34 - 1307.14] P:1520.03 E:0.094156 |  He's already had uncertain moments in this match United coming again on the right-hand side with Sancho and then Dallow and
[1307.26 - 1313.18] P:1600.59 E:0.094883 |  Back it goes now to Bruno Fernandez in a more deep-lying position. He turns plays it square and then
[1313.50 - 1320.74] P:1627.20 E:0.103551 |  Lissandro Martinez the Argentine the the number six for Manchester United turns it to the captain Harry McGuire
[1321.10 - 1325.18] P:1499.60 E:0.104557 |  United dominating possession now inside the Brighton inside the Brentford half
[1325.50 - 1330.34] P:1650.65 E:0.092228 |  He has Fred Fred's pass with the diagonal to Bruno Fernandez
[1330.74 - 1332.86] P:1521.36 E:0.100289 |  Brentford have got everyone back behind the ball
[1332.90 - 1338.46] P:1654.24 E:0.095775 |  Yeah, it's Brentford are just happy sitting in their shape and shuffling and allowing Manchester United to break them down there
[1338.46 - 1341.82] P:1559.11 E:0.103127 |  Just saying come on have a goal to see what you can do see if you can play between the lines
[1341.82 - 1348.30] P:1549.94 E:0.089109 |  But so far Manchester United just passing around the outside of this Brentford ship. Yep, Erickson again being booed
[1348.90 - 1355.02] P:1614.78 E:0.095934 |  Even though he was thought he was the man dispossessed for the second Brentford goal when Matthias Jensen
[1355.62 - 1357.74] P:1477.73 E:0.095938 |  Pick pocketed him inside the penalty area
[1358.50 - 1361.78] P:1619.89 E:0.106383 |  And then there's an overhead pass from out on the right-hand side
[1361.78 - 1365.02] P:1706.50 E:0.110053 |  Which I don't think will bounce out of play Rashford is trying to shield it
[1365.10 - 1371.02] P:1803.40 E:0.105036 |  The Hickey does well and allows the ball to bounce out of play for a throwing to Brentford
[1371.02 - 1376.66] P:1727.75 E:0.105974 |  He's one of the new faces the five new signings Aaron Hickey the young Scottish international the 20 year old
[1377.18 - 1383.38] P:1506.34 E:0.091955 |  After a couple of seasons in Italy was signed from Bologna, but great things were being said about him
[1384.22 - 1387.18] P:1527.10 E:0.100937 |  During the course of last season had a full season with them
[1387.18 - 1391.70] P:1692.10 E:0.090200 |  I think you have to say Glenn I think Brentford done some very interesting business
[1392.10 - 1397.74] P:1650.44 E:0.098554 |  This summer with some of the signings they've made like Hickey like Mikael dams guard who's on the bench the signing this week
[1398.14 - 1400.22] P:1629.44 E:0.098294 |  That isn't the word I would use interesting
[1400.22 - 1406.74] P:1675.11 E:0.097273 |  I would say it's been shrewd it's young it's talented and it's moldable and it fits into the Brentford system
[1406.74 - 1410.22] P:1697.49 E:0.104749 |  And that's what they do and that's why I think Manchester United is so far behind
[1410.38 - 1415.70] P:1715.48 E:0.097494 |  They're competitive because there's a plan that all the places here's Rashford on the edge of the area hits the shot
[1415.70 - 1420.22] P:1608.84 E:0.092264 |  But there were two Brentford defenders there Rooslav and Jansen were together Brentford
[1420.82 - 1424.90] P:1693.65 E:0.101941 |  Switched to three central defenders in their comeback against Leicester. That's how they've started here
[1424.98 - 1430.02] P:1752.02 E:0.102327 |  Me heads the ball out to Dalor and now Manchester United again Dalor on the edge of the area
[1430.02 - 1431.50] P:1794.06 E:0.106667 |  He hits a low shot, but
[1431.50 - 1433.94] P:1797.07 E:0.104047 |  Ryder is able to get down to his right quite comfortably
[1434.02 - 1438.46] P:1728.85 E:0.099123 |  He slipped as he hit it so it lacked power and it was just down to the goalkeepers, right?
[1438.46 - 1443.78] P:1473.88 E:0.100856 |  But Eric Tenhag will be happy seeing his right back in the opposition 18-yard box unleashing shot
[1443.78 - 1448.06] P:1294.93 E:0.100773 |  It wasn't quite the didn't quite have the power or accuracy he wanted
[1448.10 - 1452.58] P:1526.82 E:0.082371 |  But it is a positive for Manchester tonight, and I think any positive from the moment is a plus
[1453.62 - 1461.42] P:1659.24 E:0.097437 |  Brentford to Manchester United nil and Brentford you cannot take your eyes off this and Bermol plays it back to
[1462.42 - 1466.86] P:1682.45 E:0.101822 |  The ball that is hit over the top by Tony and eventually it does roll out of play
[1467.14 - 1472.78] P:1663.04 E:0.100193 |  Shepard it out by Ericsson. Yes, I mean shepherd it out 20 yards behind anyone else in the Manchester United shirt is
[1472.98 - 1474.86] P:1531.30 E:0.104122 |  Ericsson how how is that possible?
[1474.86 - 1480.46] P:1736.77 E:0.108185 |  How's it not a right a left back or a centre back as we as we just pause for a dream spirit breaker?
[1480.54 - 1482.54] P:1765.85 E:0.105008 |  One question I wanted to ask you John is
[1483.70 - 1490.06] P:1699.88 E:0.105068 |  Obviously when Manchester United look at the opening fixtures of the season they see bright Brighton and they see Brentford and
[1490.34 - 1492.86] P:1655.06 E:0.096305 |  They obviously think there's points there to be had
[1492.86 - 1494.86] P:1427.74 E:0.091131 |  I mean there's a long way left to go in this fixture
[1494.86 - 1499.94] P:1439.30 E:0.098779 |  But I wanted to pick you up on the on the stat you gave us the last time Manchester United lost two games
[1499.94 - 1501.94] P:1601.88 E:0.075582 |  Do you know who they were against?
[1502.26 - 1507.02] P:1587.33 E:0.105595 |  When they lost first two matches of the season the new manager or the new manager
[1508.50 - 1515.78] P:1573.90 E:0.105062 |  Back in 1921. No, do you know? No, I don't know. It's your start. Glenn I had enough trouble finding out who the manager was
[1515.78 - 1519.78] P:1625.97 E:0.101996 |  I've been trying to find that out all week, and I found out this afternoon at about 2 o'clock
[1520.06 - 1525.10] P:1701.11 E:0.100031 |  I was teeing you up there. I thought I thought I was doing you a favour John. Well, that just goes to show
[1525.10 - 1529.22] P:1486.75 E:0.097984 |  There's always more isn't there when you look up something like that. What I can tell you is that
[1531.06 - 1538.34] P:1609.41 E:0.095212 |  The the man who what was the manager who lost lost his first two matches John Chapman who was a Scotsman
[1538.34 - 1545.22] P:1664.83 E:0.091619 |  He was Manchester United's sixth manager in there in their history and they did they finished bottom that season
[1545.50 - 1552.74] P:1690.80 E:0.097563 |  Were relegated to division two but what I love about it is that three years later when Manchester United came back
[1552.98 - 1554.98] P:1724.44 E:0.085010 |  He was still the manager
[1555.06 - 1562.14] P:1749.85 E:0.093700 |  So he took them down, but three years later brought them back up. Well, I think that's the case
[1562.14 - 1566.54] P:1615.21 E:0.112572 |  I don't think we've seen Eric Tenharg again in three years. I was just gonna say Manchester United
[1567.30 - 1569.30] P:1703.40 E:0.097652 |  United finished bottom this season. I
[1570.06 - 1574.02] P:1656.59 E:0.097919 |  Think you're absolutely right. I think it'll be a long gone. But listen
[1574.02 - 1579.18] P:1544.75 E:0.095281 |  There's a long way to go and I think actually the fat and the drinks breakers now come to an end incidentally
[1579.18 - 1584.54] P:1645.53 E:0.089339 |  I think the very fact that we're seeing the same sort of mistakes happening
[1585.02 - 1587.94] P:1612.74 E:0.091238 |  Almost underlines the fact that Eric Tenharg
[1588.86 - 1595.22] P:1573.85 E:0.106894 |  Has not had time to have a proper influence yet. I don't think they're the same mistakes that happened last weekend
[1595.22 - 1598.26] P:1417.50 E:0.104664 |  I think that Brighton were the better team last weekend in this affair
[1598.26 - 1600.74] P:1466.65 E:0.106717 |  I don't feel as though Brentford have really come out and play much
[1600.74 - 1604.94] P:1743.71 E:0.097398 |  They've just pounced on opportunities that Manchester United have gifted them
[1604.94 - 1609.26] P:1680.03 E:0.103405 |  I mean that Brentford have been happy sitting in their shape for large periods of this game
[1610.18 - 1616.14] P:1721.89 E:0.099765 |  There's Brentford come forward again Brentford to Manchester United nil in this hot sunshine
[1616.66 - 1622.02] P:1698.79 E:0.108760 |  And Manchester United through McGuire just clearing the ball away and bounces out of play on the halfway line
[1622.26 - 1626.58] P:1856.40 E:0.091826 |  The point I'm making Glen is not so much last weekend's mistakes
[1627.22 - 1633.86] P:1799.83 E:0.102953 |  Mistakes that have been happening to Manchester United for years now under a string of different managers. Yeah, you're right
[1633.86 - 1635.86] P:1656.29 E:0.093864 |  It is yours. It is it's
[1635.98 - 1639.14] P:1514.95 E:0.103776 |  It's it's incredible to see how far they have fallen
[1640.14 - 1645.58] P:1781.53 E:0.095449 |  Well, they're falling to defeat here to nil down a long way to go in the match still
[1645.86 - 1650.18] P:1776.42 E:0.101463 |  Just under three quarters of the 90 minutes to play as the ball is played in field
[1650.18 - 1655.90] P:1858.63 E:0.102929 |  It's taken in field by no guard who is tripped. It's a free kick near the right edge of the box Glen
[1656.26 - 1657.46] P:1635.53 E:0.055530 |  I
[1657.46 - 1665.38] P:1716.93 E:0.093804 |  I've just watched Bruno Fernandez clearly tripped the Brentford player and then is just eyes into the referee with his arms out stretching
[1665.38 - 1671.34] P:1575.36 E:0.095172 |  His morning. It's a clear free kick. I what is the point of it's still morning at Stuart at will now?
[1673.94 - 1675.22] P:1451.06 E:0.068701 |  Yep
[1675.22 - 1676.46] P:1762.81 E:0.098259 |  Truntering away
[1676.46 - 1680.86] P:1497.45 E:0.087572 |  Let's do it that well and and that boils down to frustration that that's what it is
[1680.86 - 1682.54] P:1706.17 E:0.092658 |  It's frustration himself
[1682.54 - 1688.70] P:1425.87 E:0.095729 |  I his team at the situation they find themselves in and he's looking from external sources to take it out on
[1689.22 - 1694.42] P:1625.16 E:0.098156 |  So it's just having a drinks break then rather carelessly didn't have a drinks break when the players were having a drinks break
[1694.98 - 1702.18] P:1660.62 E:0.096950 |  Jensen to take this free kick then two man United wall lots of red and white striped Brentford shirts there inside the penalty area
[1703.42 - 1707.62] P:1687.48 E:0.109715 |  Jensen raises his arm curls it. Oh nicely on to here diving to his right
[1707.98 - 1713.26] P:1800.51 E:0.101004 |  I mean that was so close to getting a touch from one of the heads in there whether it was a Brentford or Manchester United
[1713.26 - 1715.86] P:1813.24 E:0.115853 |  Man they dive to his right pushed it away
[1715.86 - 1721.94] P:1787.71 E:0.103938 |  And now there's a foul on the far side and it's a free kick to Manchester United to Brentford in the Manchester United right back area
[1722.18 - 1724.26] P:1646.61 E:0.090674 |  And the pressure is growing on Manchester United
[1724.26 - 1729.82] P:1593.50 E:0.097242 |  But what is saved by Dehaire because like you said there could have been a touch on that the goalkeeper can't go too early
[1729.82 - 1733.98] P:1636.50 E:0.095273 |  It's going across his goal if he goes to early somebody gets a touch it goes into an empty net
[1733.98 - 1739.34] P:1487.83 E:0.088013 |  He timed that perfectly the Spanish goalkeeper and pushed it to relative safety
[1739.98 - 1741.98] P:1672.53 E:0.088009 |  so a free kick that
[1743.06 - 1745.86] P:1641.18 E:0.093108 |  Jensen has wandered across to take again
[1745.86 - 1749.38] P:1504.03 E:0.098064 |  So then me is still up there another one of those new signings
[1749.38 - 1752.02] P:1651.08 E:0.077674 |  We'll come back to that Glenn when we get a chance, but
[1752.54 - 1755.82] P:1699.11 E:0.093517 |  Pondess Jensen as well the captain is in there too so
[1757.02 - 1758.10] P:1489.26 E:0.070178 |  considerable
[1758.10 - 1759.78] P:1719.87 E:0.093604 |  presence from those two
[1759.90 - 1766.46] P:1778.17 E:0.095203 |  Free kick then from the left right footed from Jensen into the near post and it's deflected a right across the penalty area
[1766.46 - 1769.94] P:1811.27 E:0.093837 |  There were I mean a two players from each side going for that
[1770.58 - 1778.02] P:1790.47 E:0.104244 |  And in the end Rashford deflects the ball behind from Norgaard's cross high up into the stand for another corner to Brentford
[1778.02 - 1783.62] P:1695.92 E:0.094582 |  I mean Thomas Frank can't want any more from that free kick from Jensen. He's a superb free kick
[1783.62 - 1786.26] P:1765.47 E:0.100103 |  It's right on the money. It's in the danger area
[1786.78 - 1791.46] P:1647.70 E:0.092064 |  Luckily for Munch United they managed to scramble it clear set piece delivery has been
[1792.34 - 1794.34] P:1494.35 E:0.085365 |  outstanding and now
[1794.50 - 1796.50] P:1658.73 E:0.093584 |  Cue this corner hit in the front post
[1797.94 - 1804.26] P:1701.00 E:0.096034 |  Well, I sat and watched Chelsea hit corner after corner this time last week in the first half the Brentford players group together now
[1804.26 - 1807.78] P:1889.98 E:0.099445 |  They head in all sorts of different directions. There are two potential takers. It's in Burma
[1807.78 - 1811.58] P:1739.92 E:0.099468 |  Oh, it says no it's to the back post and it's headed back across for Brentford
[1811.58 - 1813.58] P:1867.77 E:0.113056 |  And the ball drops into the net
[1813.58 - 1816.70] P:1849.36 E:0.114809 |  Ben me gonna touch to it the goal stands
[1817.90 - 1820.54] P:1875.91 E:0.126044 |  Then me raises away and punches the air
[1821.58 - 1823.58] P:1925.25 E:0.116903 |  And it's Brentford three
[1823.90 - 1828.66] P:1717.87 E:0.113035 |  Manchester United now and they simply didn't deal with it a back post header
[1828.98 - 1835.74] P:1757.49 E:0.114144 |  The drop across the face of the goal and then me almost on the goal line getting some sort of touch did affect it in
[1835.74 - 1841.14] P:1756.61 E:0.111429 |  And I'm not sure this Manchester United side are going to be capable of coming back from this even though
[1841.18 - 1845.34] P:1824.31 E:0.106958 |  We've got an hour to play it's Brentford three Manchester United Neil
[1845.74 - 1850.22] P:1639.96 E:0.105455 |  It's a routine corner to the back stick, but it's the big man Ivan Tony that wins the ball and
[1851.58 - 1857.90] P:1637.75 E:0.102664 |  Somehow Ben me almost falls and heads it into the back of the net at the back stick
[1858.26 - 1859.98] P:1765.23 E:0.107566 |  To make it three
[1859.98 - 1868.18] P:1722.03 E:0.102216 |  Neil to Brentford and the Manchester United players shrudge out of their rating yard books heads hung in shame
[1871.18 - 1873.82] P:1691.72 E:0.116122 |  Simple set-piece goal well worked set-piece goal
[1874.02 - 1879.14] P:1588.65 E:0.107659 |  Yes, and it's funny because Eric Tenhag he highlighted that point this week, didn't he?
[1879.26 - 1885.42] P:1586.74 E:0.113234 |  How the set-piece goal last weekend against Brighton was a plus because they've been so bad at them last season
[1885.50 - 1888.46] P:1335.64 E:0.106721 |  And then he sees his side do that and he's onwards
[1890.30 - 1895.46] P:1641.66 E:0.103494 |  Delivery was brilliant though and Burma who took it with a left foot somebody's run onto the field
[1895.46 - 1900.74] P:1630.40 E:0.105432 |  So we've got it. We've got a delay here. I don't know if he's had too much son or too much for you
[1900.98 - 1906.64] P:1636.32 E:0.105092 |  There possibly a combination of them both but he's been wrestled over ground by the stewards and under the new rules this this season
[1906.66 - 1908.66] P:1459.87 E:0.077529 |  I mean, this is where it's
[1909.22 - 1910.50] P:1591.74 E:0.109763 |  This is where it's up
[1910.50 - 1915.20] P:1652.41 E:0.109217 |  This is where it's absolute madness because this this young man. I mean he's banned now
[1915.20 - 1919.70] P:1613.24 E:0.113729 |  He's banned from going to football and rightfully so John. You can't be running the field to play
[1919.86 - 1925.90] P:1630.79 E:0.108612 |  No any any point in any game. It's just unacceptable behavior, especially with some of the scenes we saw at the end of last season
[1926.50 - 1927.74] P:1582.44 E:0.083521 |  so
[1927.74 - 1929.74] P:1772.67 E:0.095337 |  three Nilda Brentford
[1930.94 - 1932.46] P:1682.39 E:0.099019 |  I mean it was
[1932.46 - 1938.90] P:1520.72 E:0.097305 |  The scoreline was a surprise last Sunday, you know Brendan Brent Brighton having never won there
[1939.22 - 1946.34] P:1650.56 E:0.096048 |  Against Manchester United, but they played so well Brighton in the first half particularly, but this I mean this is
[1947.34 - 1951.82] P:1490.14 E:0.101966 |  This is just extraordinary. I mean, I know I know we're sitting here and Brentford are three little up
[1951.82 - 1957.38] P:1688.20 E:0.096214 |  Do you but do you think they've played that well John? I don't actually that's that's the funny thing
[1957.42 - 1958.38] P:1751.43 E:0.095587 |  Had to
[1958.38 - 1966.22] P:1527.43 E:0.094212 |  Manchester United created their own issues and and not defended properly and they find themselves three in the down and they pretty much are the only three
[1966.50 - 1968.98] P:1543.03 E:0.096402 |  Opportunities if you can call them that the Brentford have had
[1969.42 - 1972.02] P:1711.15 E:0.102742 |  Well, Mark Chapman will round everything up for you
[1972.02 - 1977.64] P:1659.92 E:0.099913 |  That's happened today in the sporting world at halftime Arsenal and Manchester City have got two wins out of two now
[1978.14 - 1985.54] P:1622.28 E:0.102188 |  Also among the main stories Alexander Mitrovich having late penalty saved in Wolves in fulham's nil nil at Wolves

[2006.30 - 2011.30] P:1751.95 E:0.100010 |  But the big story of the day is happening and unfolding right in front of our eyes here at the community stadium
[2012.18 - 2013.78] P:1678.15 E:0.085760 |  in West London
[2013.82 - 2019.02] P:1751.21 E:0.088225 |  Between the M4 and the River Thames in this stifling sunshine
[2019.02 - 2022.98] P:1536.87 E:0.092310 |  And and I think that in itself is another point in these conditions
[2023.50 - 2030.06] P:1676.68 E:0.095246 |  From Manchester United to have to come from three nil down and that is going to take a Herculean effort
[2030.86 - 2038.30] P:1445.80 E:0.102870 |  Yes, and as you were given that report there the Brentford fans were in full voice and they were singing you should have stayed at a big club
[2038.30 - 2042.38] P:1550.47 E:0.096846 |  I wonder who that was in wonder I wonder for Christian Ericsson
[2042.98 - 2051.22] P:1600.30 E:0.089606 |  Wasn't supposed to happen this way Fernandez crossing the ball out towards the right-hand side Daloh in the shadows to our left
[2053.78 - 2059.50] P:1678.45 E:0.104454 |  Sancho back to Daloh then Sancho again a dart into the penalty area a little ball through for Fred Fred is forced wide
[2059.50 - 2064.42] P:1748.03 E:0.095930 |  He has to give it back out to Daloh Dalos low ball across Sancho took a touch, but it bounced away from him
[2064.42 - 2068.38] P:1702.35 E:0.110651 |  And there are so many numbers in there Brentford have got everyone in there that you know
[2068.38 - 2073.22] P:1813.85 E:0.114983 |  This back five that it is and they clear the ball downfield and now it's played across from Bournemouth
[2073.22 - 2080.38] P:1827.73 E:0.115402 |  And Bournemouth gets away from Shaw and scores and it's four nil this time on the counter attack
[2081.70 - 2087.50] P:1804.70 E:0.114037 |  Brentford have not witnessed anything like this for decades and decades and decades
[2088.14 - 2090.94] P:1810.75 E:0.117835 |  There's four nil up on Manchester United
[2091.06 - 2096.18] P:1783.29 E:0.115025 |  This is dream land for their man for Thomas Frank, but it's a living nightmare
[2096.70 - 2103.70] P:1706.32 E:0.109093 |  But that man's out there the new Manchester United manager Eric Tenhark who sits quietly in his seat
[2103.90 - 2110.08] P:1692.65 E:0.108345 |  This score line will be being sent out all around the world and it is
[2110.66 - 2112.42] P:1820.33 E:0.097357 |  Brentford for
[2112.42 - 2114.42] P:1909.91 E:0.098820 |  Manchester United nil
[2114.42 - 2121.74] P:1593.20 E:0.108702 |  People all over the world will be sitting up and noticing this result for nil already before halftime the mighty
[2122.50 - 2127.90] P:1647.01 E:0.097700 |  Manchester United undone by Brentford football club and that goal right there was
[2128.62 - 2133.22] P:1642.58 E:0.111159 |  Absolutely brilliant. They won the ball in their own eight in the air box pleaded down the channel
[2133.22 - 2135.30] P:1691.53 E:0.109110 |  Tony was free to run down the channel
[2135.30 - 2138.30] P:1636.78 E:0.107152 |  He plays it into the center of the field Brian and Bournemouth
[2138.30 - 2145.58] P:1708.52 E:0.102242 |  Bursa and his guts together has a touch and plays it to the right hand side nice hard and low side footed
[2145.74 - 2147.74] P:1601.66 E:0.095064 |  down the side of
[2147.78 - 2153.74] P:1598.57 E:0.111823 |  David Dehaier to make it four nil and it is absolutely humble. I'm lost for words John
[2153.74 - 2157.02] P:1534.30 E:0.116550 |  I really am this is incredible what we witness in here
[2157.02 - 2160.22] P:1721.83 E:0.111031 |  But I mean this is on a par and you don't have to go back far
[2160.78 - 2167.26] P:1686.76 E:0.105968 |  This is on a par with their penultimate match of last season when they lost four nil at Brighton
[2168.10 - 2171.66] P:1739.20 E:0.100339 |  And in actual fact this I mean this has to be a defeat now
[2171.66 - 2175.94] P:1801.42 E:0.098242 |  I mean surely they can't come back from this and if that's the case that will be eight
[2176.94 - 2181.74] P:1701.95 E:0.097977 |  consecutive league away defeats for for Manchester United
[2185.02 - 2189.98] P:1593.98 E:0.099754 |  And I mean that has not happened that a run like that has not happened since
[2191.54 - 2193.94] P:1711.51 E:0.087947 |  1936 and actually strangely
[2194.58 - 2201.30] P:1674.71 E:0.100785 |  Within that run back in 1936 of what turned out to be ten consecutive away league defeats in a role
[2201.42 - 2204.14] P:1724.50 E:0.097893 |  They lost four nil away to Brentford
[2205.98 - 2210.98] P:1648.95 E:0.106910 |  Isn't it strange it is how how it you get quirks like that, but this is the present day
[2210.98 - 2214.62] P:1893.71 E:0.104604 |  This is 2022 and this is unreal. It's four nil to Brentford
[2214.62 - 2220.62] P:1658.61 E:0.099935 |  Here's the man who scored the latest goal and Bermol and and suddenly Brentford out knocking the ball around on the edge of the box
[2220.62 - 2227.06] P:1809.80 E:0.101795 |  De Silva who started the corner the scoring gives it to the left-hand side the cross from me. That's headed away by Shaw
[2227.78 - 2230.58] P:1784.94 E:0.109449 |  De Silva a heavy touch and then it's won back
[2231.58 - 2237.54] P:1790.93 E:0.102046 |  By Hickey who actually hurt himself in the challenge on Fred and Manchester United in the end actually come out with the ball
[2237.62 - 2239.62] P:1767.31 E:0.091838 |  Less than ten minutes to go to halftime
[2239.86 - 2242.02] P:1796.85 E:0.095884 |  Bruno Fernandez long downfield Rashford and
[2242.62 - 2245.74] P:1785.71 E:0.113202 |  Ria has come out of his goal and the goalkeeper got a meaningful touch
[2246.50 - 2249.98] P:1797.02 E:0.111411 |  It was an aerial challenge actually between him and Rashford
[2250.50 - 2254.82] P:1834.74 E:0.109481 |  And Rashford has been left on the ground. I don't think I was a suggestion that that was a foul
[2255.42 - 2260.90] P:1743.09 E:0.107284 |  By by Ria who was challenging no ball seen cleanly for the ball, but he's caught Rashford
[2261.06 - 2265.32] P:1506.55 E:0.101720 |  Yes, both plays it was an honest attempt from both plays to get the ball
[2265.32 - 2268.50] P:1482.54 E:0.104375 |  And it was just a collision as they were both running to one other's Ria comes out
[2268.50 - 2270.50] P:1609.08 E:0.090085 |  He gets a good chunk of the ball
[2271.14 - 2273.14] P:1619.84 E:0.100621 |  And he cleans his two to safety
[2276.94 - 2282.14] P:1690.27 E:0.105974 |  Glenn you had a long career as a professional footballer what 20 years are there about?
[2283.14 - 2285.14] P:1681.73 E:0.105246 |  Yes, you don't see you don't see
[2287.14 - 2290.02] P:1769.35 E:0.112333 |  Occasions like this too often do you I mean this feels
[2291.02 - 2293.02] P:1628.80 E:0.102604 |  No, this feels massive
[2293.02 - 2298.26] P:1616.85 E:0.103357 |  That's why I just said I'm lost for words and it's not being in dressing rooms of clubs
[2298.26 - 2302.78] P:1624.04 E:0.098344 |  the sort of similar size to to Bremford and and before this game there
[2302.78 - 2308.84] P:1546.50 E:0.100485 |  There would have been a belief that they could go out there and and beat this current Manchester United crop when they seen the line up
[2309.44 - 2313.24] P:1457.13 E:0.100707 |  Obviously what's going on the football club at the moment that there would have been a slight belief
[2313.24 - 2315.00] P:1192.69 E:0.099903 |  But there would have been a worry as well
[2315.00 - 2322.36] P:1377.02 E:0.109940 |  But slowly throughout this first half where you've seen that belief grow into confidence and they're smoking the ball around now
[2322.64 - 2328.24] P:1490.12 E:0.106237 |  And as you can hear I mean the the Bremford fans are in absolute dreamland and I just wonder
[2328.44 - 2330.76] P:1432.38 E:0.111108 |  Does it get any better for a Brentwood supporter?
[2331.24 - 2334.48] P:1713.45 E:0.097714 |  Well Marcus Rashford who was clevered by
[2335.48 - 2340.92] P:1655.25 E:0.102768 |  David Ryan who headed the ball away and then caught Rashford obviously they're taking care with him
[2341.56 - 2346.60] P:1768.43 E:0.103254 |  Marcus Rashford was very much in the news at the moment clearly PSG are interested
[2346.96 - 2351.80] P:1597.97 E:0.097659 |  But Eric Ten Haag was making it very plain yesterday that he wants him to stay
[2352.48 - 2359.88] P:1622.02 E:0.100621 |  But I mean what a star this is losing to want a Brighton in his first Premier League match and now four-nil down at Bremford
[2360.60 - 2364.20] P:1787.25 E:0.114586 |  Brighton and Brentford with all due respect
[2364.48 - 2366.48] P:1613.93 E:0.105425 |  Then they do deserve respect both of them
[2366.92 - 2370.36] P:1803.90 E:0.104559 |  For what Brighton did last weekend and for what Brentford have done here
[2370.84 - 2371.92] P:1873.64 E:0.086632 |  but
[2371.92 - 2373.92] P:1655.48 E:0.103323 |  Even so I mean
[2374.00 - 2378.96] P:1530.69 E:0.104771 |  There are fractions in the Manchester United side that you can see that the players aren't happy
[2378.96 - 2383.16] P:1600.61 E:0.092148 |  But I think the biggest problem for me is that triangle at the back
[2383.72 - 2386.12] P:1522.98 E:0.096603 |  Is Martinez, McGuire and Dehaier?
[2386.24 - 2393.80] P:1568.16 E:0.093405 |  They don't look comfortable together and as that fourth goal goal went in I could see McGuire going back towards his goalkeeper and centre-back partner
[2394.48 - 2397.20] P:1555.65 E:0.105787 |  With his arms flailing in the air and that isn't what you want
[2397.20 - 2401.36] P:1393.57 E:0.110292 |  You need to be a team whether you're winning or losing you need to do it together and at the moment
[2401.96 - 2406.24] P:1613.03 E:0.100784 |  Manchester United and yeah, that there just looks to be a greater hunger out there
[2406.24 - 2412.92] P:1624.12 E:0.101125 |  I must say we're watching now Brentford and and Roe Sleve and no guard De Silva. I mean De Silva looks
[2413.68 - 2416.52] P:1469.92 E:0.105409 |  I mean talk about Hungary looks as though he hasn't eaten for a fortnight
[2416.52 - 2424.04] P:1617.48 E:0.102746 |  I mean I would I would really like to see the stats that they're running the high speed running and the distance covered because
[2424.60 - 2430.32] P:1752.60 E:0.105367 |  The fundamentals of football you take all talent out of it and the least you can do is work hard
[2430.84 - 2433.56] P:1746.77 E:0.103374 |  And I just question this Manchester United group
[2433.56 - 2438.52] P:1727.58 E:0.095030 |  Are they working hard enough regardless of if their actions are correct if their decisions are correct?
[2438.52 - 2442.04] P:1619.29 E:0.103768 |  Are they working hard enough and that is the easiest thing to do as a footballer?
[2442.64 - 2444.84] P:1850.14 E:0.111718 |  Brentford it is in possession warm applause
[2446.56 - 2448.88] P:1655.75 E:0.109367 |  The second season in the Premier League
[2449.80 - 2453.48] P:1628.24 E:0.099894 |  They were terrific the way that they came back and got a point at Leicester last weekend
[2453.48 - 2456.96] P:1661.24 E:0.101979 |  But they've been out of this world against Manchester United here taking the chances
[2456.96 - 2461.48] P:1800.60 E:0.106020 |  But here's Rashford into the penalty area and Rashford trying to work the ball across took a deflection
[2461.60 - 2465.96] P:1882.24 E:0.103434 |  But David Ryer was able to drop onto it and hold it securely
[2466.00 - 2473.32] P:1835.69 E:0.095188 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live on a Saturday night and what a story we're bringing you in this 530 kickoff
[2474.04 - 2476.44] P:1885.85 E:0.106101 |  Brentford for Manchester United nil
[2476.84 - 2480.64] P:1847.24 E:0.095571 |  Four goals from four different players Josh De Silva in the 10th minute
[2480.96 - 2487.16] P:1715.20 E:0.098542 |  Matthias Jensen in the 18th Ben me in the 30th his first goal for the club on his home debut and
[2487.40 - 2494.20] P:1555.67 E:0.105121 |  Brian and Burma in the 35th John you need to start giving a warning out before you deliver that because there'll be people out there
[2494.40 - 2498.80] P:1605.16 E:0.100941 |  Crushing there'll be accidents people falling off seats because that it's incredible, isn't it?
[2498.80 - 2503.36] P:1376.83 E:0.097532 |  It's not even half-time and it's 4-0 to Brentford as if we haven't got enough to worry about at the moment
[2504.12 - 2510.76] P:1641.78 E:0.102847 |  Balls played forward up towards Rashford, but it bounces off reverse level out of play for a throw in C United near the halfway line
[2511.56 - 2512.76] P:1689.70 E:0.071376 |  United's
[2512.76 - 2514.76] P:1521.28 E:0.078375 |  substitutes today
[2515.40 - 2519.20] P:1505.97 E:0.098192 |  Malasia verran Juan Bersaca Vanda Bake Alanga Ghana
[2519.40 - 2523.48] P:1717.24 E:0.090684 |  Mctominet and Garnaccio as well as Tom Heaton United coming forward
[2523.48 - 2528.00] P:1724.22 E:0.095837 |  But I mean frankly four nil down in these conditions in these sweltering conditions
[2528.84 - 2531.84] P:1661.98 E:0.102201 |  I mean normally four nil down you would say no
[2533.20 - 2534.68] P:1659.02 E:0.081914 |  but
[2534.68 - 2536.80] P:1651.95 E:0.106290 |  It has to be too much on a day like this
[2537.48 - 2543.96] P:1498.89 E:0.103388 |  Yes, I mean it would be an absolutely incredible comeback that they are probing they are showing signs of life
[2543.96 - 2549.36] P:1725.88 E:0.096609 |  But Brentford are just so comfortable sat in their shoes. Yes, Fernandez Fernandez on the edge of the area shoots
[2549.36 - 2554.20] P:1671.78 E:0.095087 |  But that's blocked again there are two Brentford defenders in the way as a softened being the case
[2554.52 - 2561.84] P:1642.54 E:0.086303 |  Sure plays it square has happened before of course remember check Teotate and Arsenal a new castle
[2562.32 - 2563.92] P:1636.94 E:0.077429 |  but
[2563.92 - 2565.48] P:1696.96 E:0.087985 |  just
[2565.48 - 2570.80] P:1656.35 E:0.099568 |  Sitting here. It's all very well talking about that sitting here inside the ground and feeling what this is like and
[2571.08 - 2575.56] P:1652.04 E:0.099818 |  And the way that the players have been the way the crowd are just the reaction of the players
[2575.76 - 2579.52] P:1511.40 E:0.089363 |  That's why I'm saying there's over half the game to play but I cannot say it
[2579.52 - 2585.16] P:1571.34 E:0.094660 |  We've just witnessed Martin as the the the deepest play for Manchester United in possession of the ball
[2585.28 - 2590.08] P:1619.86 E:0.081845 |  Trying cut back across when Burma. I mean why would you risk that?
[2590.44 - 2593.88] P:1490.12 E:0.091558 |  The Brentford players in on goal if he robs you there of the ball
[2593.88 - 2599.58] P:1643.52 E:0.098609 |  I mean he needs to get up to speed with the Premier League better from United working it on the edge of the area Fred and
[2599.60 - 2602.00] P:1735.83 E:0.102138 |  Fernandez sure tries to play it in it bounces away
[2602.44 - 2604.00] P:1794.08 E:0.099419 |  Erickson nods it forward
[2604.00 - 2610.00] P:1676.42 E:0.097324 |  Half cleared away nodded in by McGuire headed away by Ben me and then McGuire out towards the right-hand side
[2610.52 - 2614.60] P:1544.55 E:0.090918 |  Manchester United are parked inside the Brentford half, but they're four-nil down
[2615.88 - 2621.04] P:1692.27 E:0.103958 |  As Bruno Fernandez is going to try a shot from 22 23 yards out
[2621.04 - 2623.04] P:1579.37 E:0.105361 |  But it curls away over by a couple of yards
[2623.60 - 2627.64] P:1553.48 E:0.095764 |  But a happy with them shooting through people shooting from 25 yards
[2628.16 - 2631.80] P:1670.86 E:0.090907 |  And you say that Manchester United a camped in the Brentford half
[2631.80 - 2634.68] P:1577.89 E:0.082611 |  I think that's Brentford allowing them to camping there
[2634.68 - 2640.12] P:1558.69 E:0.092958 |  I think Brentford are happy to sit in their shape their two banks everyone behind there the ball and
[2640.52 - 2645.36] P:1615.64 E:0.093514 |  I'm just wondering if this is a tactic from Thomas Frank to conserve energy and
[2645.68 - 2652.52] P:1591.00 E:0.092485 |  Just sit and allow Manchester United to run make make runs that they're not going to get the ball on and and just waste energy and time at this point
[2652.52 - 2657.96] P:1506.63 E:0.091228 |  Yeah, one of the Brentford regulars when we were talking about the match this afternoon Glen before the game
[2658.72 - 2666.52] P:1572.58 E:0.092236 |  He actually said he said Brentford have got as much energy as any team in the Premier League when we're talking about the conditions and
[2667.44 - 2669.44] P:1622.80 E:0.106286 |  I mean the brilliantly coached
[2670.36 - 2675.28] P:1641.00 E:0.097313 |  Thomas Frank he's won a lot of friends hasn't he and a lot of admirers this this Danish coach
[2675.96 - 2679.88] P:1565.88 E:0.097164 |  Yeah, he has indeed and and and deservedly so but
[2680.56 - 2683.72] P:1637.58 E:0.087418 |  It's not just Thomas Frank. It's everybody the football club
[2683.76 - 2689.60] P:1706.34 E:0.100207 |  There's a clear philosophy that everyone's pulling in the right direction and this is this is what happens when you get that
[2689.76 - 2693.92] P:1636.60 E:0.095308 |  Well, they're equaling their record win at the moment against Manchester United
[2693.92 - 2698.80] P:1738.49 E:0.097691 |  That was that 4-0 in division one back in 1947 there
[2699.76 - 2705.56] P:1679.11 E:0.107573 |  They're only previous spelled in the top flight when they were there either side of World War two
[2706.92 - 2709.60] P:1463.60 E:0.097707 |  But this will be Manchester United's
[2710.48 - 2711.68] P:1639.21 E:0.075862 |  first
[2711.72 - 2718.52] P:1594.93 E:0.096027 |  Defeat to Brentford since then first time they've lost to Brentford since before the second World War
[2719.48 - 2720.68] P:1701.07 E:0.089893 |  4-0
[2720.68 - 2725.96] P:1726.00 E:0.102034 |  Four additional minutes will be played at the end of this first half, but what a first half we've seen here
[2726.52 - 2728.00] P:1710.46 E:0.084534 |  Long and forward
[2728.00 - 2733.48] P:1624.69 E:0.085005 |  Roerslav is underneath that one of the two players that Thomas Frank brought into his side changed to
[2733.84 - 2739.44] P:1735.50 E:0.092576 |  Start with three central defenders having finished the game against Leicester with three and making that comeback
[2739.44 - 2742.00] P:1695.57 E:0.098241 |  So what a start to the season it is for them to nail down
[2742.32 - 2746.28] P:1571.12 E:0.088794 |  Against Leicester, but then getting a point from that match and now starting here
[2746.28 - 2749.00] P:1531.55 E:0.100716 |  But helped by those early errors by Manchester United
[2749.56 - 2751.84] P:1499.34 E:0.109610 |  David to here you'll see it on match of the day tonight
[2751.84 - 2754.00] P:1462.97 E:0.101761 |  You'll be able to talk about it on 6-0-6 as well
[2754.12 - 2760.24] P:1522.19 E:0.092420 |  By the way from 7 30 or thereabouts with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton sure playing the ball into the Brentford box
[2760.60 - 2764.52] P:1736.79 E:0.103946 |  Raya comes for it gets a hand to it that Rico Henry is on hand
[2765.04 - 2769.32] P:1781.29 E:0.103644 |  Just a stoop and head the ball back to his goalkeeper and he's got it safely
[2769.48 - 2772.36] P:1669.68 E:0.101514 |  Yes, we'll hear from Chris and Robbie at half time
[2773.16 - 2778.00] P:1573.83 E:0.101230 |  Once we've rounded everything up with Mark Chapman, but I did look on the website yesterday at Chris Sutton's
[2778.48 - 2783.82] P:1622.30 E:0.086944 |  Predictions and I saw that he predicted a 3-0 win for Brenton for Brentford in this match
[2784.32 - 2786.32] P:1740.69 E:0.085539 |  And I thought to myself
[2786.36 - 2793.60] P:1587.73 E:0.100044 |  Good old Chris. There he is. He's stirring up a few with that. Actually, he's been he's been too conservative
[2794.60 - 2801.08] P:1616.87 E:0.096932 |  Incredibly well Brentford haven't been first a match of the day very often, but I think tonight the fans will get just what they want
[2801.64 - 2805.08] P:1418.48 E:0.074640 |  They will and sadly so will Manchester United
[2805.84 - 2808.88] P:1630.64 E:0.096548 |  be first on just like last Sunday night as well after the
[2809.56 - 2811.92] P:1360.95 E:0.114735 |  the Brighton defeat and McGuire is
[2813.04 - 2819.52] P:1630.14 E:0.096258 |  Just dwelling on the ball Tony is all over the back of him. He was able to flick it back to goalkeeper to here and
[2821.04 - 2823.04] P:1769.68 E:0.103109 |  and now
[2823.72 - 2829.44] P:1711.94 E:0.106143 |  Challenge from from Hickey who goes in rather strongly on Ronaldo, but there were two of them there
[2829.44 - 2835.72] P:1692.98 E:0.090895 |  It was Janssen and Hickey together. They sandwiched Ronaldo not letting them settle. Okay. It's a foul
[2835.72 - 2838.84] P:1512.95 E:0.098442 |  It's a free-kick and no more. He's just stepped across Ronaldo Ronaldo
[2838.84 - 2843.52] P:1537.97 E:0.095631 |  I think was happy he was going no way is happy to buy that free-kick and Manchester United are gonna load the box for
[2844.12 - 2847.68] P:1576.14 E:0.083076 |  What could possibly be one the last efforts of the first half?
[2847.68 - 2851.84] P:1645.13 E:0.096880 |  I can see the television cameraman down there just hovering next to Eric Ten Haag
[2853.72 - 2855.72] P:1589.88 E:0.100966 |  I mean what a first half for him
[2856.48 - 2859.24] P:1668.44 E:0.087601 |  When you thought it perhaps couldn't get any worse
[2859.76 - 2867.00] P:1742.99 E:0.103129 |  It just has free kick is played in by Ericsson, but Raya comes very confidently and catches the ball
[2867.56 - 2871.68] P:1813.77 E:0.103792 |  We've still got a minute and a half of the first half added time to play
[2872.60 - 2875.60] P:1675.89 E:0.105848 |  But Eric Ten Haag, you know, he's been a serial winner at Ajax
[2876.00 - 2878.92] P:1656.42 E:0.094621 |  Winner of the league title with them the last couple of seasons
[2879.64 - 2882.72] P:1660.01 E:0.092840 |  Managed to the big club, but now he is facing
[2884.40 - 2886.40] P:1701.84 E:0.096568 |  The
[2887.08 - 2891.92] P:1603.31 E:0.099607 |  Unprecedented pressure of being the manager of Manchester United when things are not going well
[2892.00 - 2895.52] P:1521.56 E:0.088884 |  this this is without doubt the biggest test he'll have in his career and
[2895.96 - 2902.68] P:1677.92 E:0.094656 |  I think you look at Manchester United from the outside and the size of the club lords you in but for me at the moment
[2902.68 - 2905.20] P:1798.36 E:0.093089 |  It's a poison chalice. I think that
[2905.60 - 2910.28] P:1783.41 E:0.100882 |  It all boils down to the owners to the owners one success. Are they back in Manchester United enough?
[2910.28 - 2916.68] P:1660.03 E:0.095874 |  I think there's a huge question mark hanging over that we talk about Brentford and how everyone's pulling in one direction. There's the philosophy
[2917.16 - 2923.32] P:1684.90 E:0.097361 |  The exact opposite to Manchester United Fred Conceits a free kick Brentford played in the ensign into the penalty area
[2923.32 - 2928.96] P:1750.40 E:0.102720 |  A stretch and away from Martinez who was up against Norgaard near the corner of the six yard box
[2929.08 - 2931.84] P:1690.19 E:0.095105 |  Well, they've already scored from a corner from this side
[2932.84 - 2934.84] P:1679.20 E:0.091239 |  Surely not another one
[2935.72 - 2938.32] P:1718.76 E:0.103680 |  Just before the break to round it all off
[2938.48 - 2944.84] P:1643.58 E:0.092979 |  The last one was brilliantly delivered if you remember if you were listening by unburmold to the back post and Tony got up for that
[2944.84 - 2947.52] P:1734.09 E:0.089615 |  What have they got this time up there up there Brentford sleeves?
[2947.72 - 2952.38] P:1604.58 E:0.091126 |  Well, the players gathered together near the penalty spot all of them head in different directions again
[2952.40 - 2956.92] P:1643.83 E:0.093542 |  And here is the delivery this time. It's actually from Jensen, but that's deep as well
[2956.92 - 2961.84] P:1714.74 E:0.098741 |  It's taken down by Tony who backed away. He tried to play it across the penalty area was cut out by Fred
[2961.84 - 2968.76] P:1854.75 E:0.110167 |  And there is the halftime whistle and Manchester United are put out of their misery for well 15 minutes of
[2969.36 - 2970.24] P:1722.78 E:0.123818 |  the
[2970.24 - 2975.60] P:1829.01 E:0.099754 |  Of the halftime break in the cool of the dressing room, but what a a red hot
[2975.60 - 2982.60] P:1871.51 E:0.092529 |  What a white hot first half for Brentford who are winning 4-0 against Manchester United
[2983.72 - 2988.32] P:1565.95 E:0.100032 |  It's just been remarkable Glen Murray. It has been an absolutely incredible
[2988.32 - 2994.60] P:1573.93 E:0.103055 |  There's two people I watch trudge off that field there and I'd love to give a penny for their thoughts once Cristiano Ronaldo
[2994.96 - 3001.28] P:1575.61 E:0.100759 |  The heights at which he left this football club on what he's returned to and the other ones Christian Ericsson who must
[3001.64 - 3005.92] P:1674.97 E:0.099570 |  Be thinking he's gonna wake up at any point because this is a living nightmare
[3005.92 - 3010.24] P:1686.93 E:0.097538 |  It is yeah, Eric Tynhard facing defeat in his second match
[3010.76 - 3017.72] P:1696.67 E:0.104633 |  And facing the possibility in fact the likelihood of being the first Manchester United manager to lose his first two matches in
[3017.76 - 3019.76] P:1585.28 E:0.098976 |  Charge since 1921
[3019.76 - 3025.12] P:1683.77 E:0.101690 |  That simply cannot see them coming back from Brentford for Manchester United nil here at halftime
[3025.76 - 3031.36] P:1494.41 E:0.113571 |  And you look at that cladonian thinking if only United had managed to get Marco and out of it in this week
[3034.20 - 3039.34] P:1547.43 E:0.106974 |  Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking actually choppers I mean good grief
[3039.34 - 3043.32] P:1539.87 E:0.098595 |  I mean look look this is this is a well-run
[3043.72 - 3045.72] P:1650.65 E:0.073485 |  well coached
[3045.72 - 3052.20] P:1474.77 E:0.098325 |  Football club with the players that the head coach wants with a system that works in modern
[3052.80 - 3055.88] P:1580.41 E:0.090687 |  21st century football against a club that appears absolutely
[3056.64 - 3058.64] P:1331.18 E:0.086860 |  Rotten from the top to the bottom
[3059.40 - 3064.14] P:1428.53 E:0.112077 |  Isn't it? I don't know why you sound so surprised. I know I'm not surprised. I mean it was the same last week
[3064.14 - 3069.24] P:1419.97 E:0.101664 |  You know the surprise around Brighton winning. It's exactly the same thing Brighton Brentford
[3069.72 - 3073.00] P:1757.44 E:0.104456 |  Well run well coached everybody pulling in the same direction
[3073.04 - 3079.52] P:1887.06 E:0.096799 |  Manches United rotten rotten rotten rotten a change of the helm is not gonna change this football club
[3079.60 - 3087.68] P:1755.67 E:0.095408 |  Well, I say helm and by helm I made the manager the hierarchy if that was to change then I think that the club could possibly get back on track
[3087.68 - 3089.68] P:1716.95 E:0.084263 |  I mean we've heard the the
[3090.52 - 3092.52] P:1754.79 E:0.103729 |  Superstars that made Manchester United
[3093.00 - 3096.48] P:1574.04 E:0.099937 |  Such a driving force in them in that while I say the modern-day game
[3096.48 - 3100.44] P:1494.71 E:0.106063 |  But those times have gone I suppose your Gary Neville's your Roy Keane's your real Ferdinand's
[3100.72 - 3106.28] P:1575.32 E:0.102784 |  And you know what I actually really feel for those fellas because they made they made this club what it is
[3108.24 - 3110.24] P:1655.18 E:0.097019 |  You can't live in the past
[3110.96 - 3115.00] P:1502.25 E:0.110254 |  No, you can't determine to live in the past like it's a 90s theme park
[3115.00 - 3120.96] P:1752.55 E:0.103822 |  But it must hurt those guys that made the club so great to see it falling so badly at the moment
[3122.40 - 3127.36] P:1750.91 E:0.097966 |  For all for all that all the you know you could criticize systems and this that and the other
[3128.36 - 3131.44] P:1729.55 E:0.109511 |  Brentford know that Manchester United can't play out from the back
[3131.80 - 3136.12] P:1731.40 E:0.109185 |  So John said they run more than anybody else. They've got more energy than anybody else
[3136.24 - 3143.72] P:1609.30 E:0.097393 |  So they press and they press and they cause Manchester United problems because because Brentford know how as Brighton did know how to work United
[3143.72 - 3150.68] P:1720.47 E:0.104923 |  Oh, I mean hard work beats talent every day if talent doesn't have to work hard and that is it's an old adage
[3150.68 - 3153.32] P:1648.61 E:0.094728 |  But for me that sums Manchester United up at the moment
[3153.32 - 3158.24] P:1707.05 E:0.100755 |  They have got superstars listen Jaden Sancho was absolutely superb in Germany for Dortmund
[3158.24 - 3163.24] P:1763.72 E:0.100644 |  He was brilliant in the Champions League. He doesn't come to Manchester United and all of a sudden become a bad player
[3163.64 - 3167.12] P:1711.26 E:0.082915 |  It's the system. It's the structure. It's the football club
[3168.52 - 3175.96] P:1774.91 E:0.102027 |  More from John and Glenn second half on the way the lines are open I think for 606 0808 5
[3176.32 - 3177.32] P:1989.57 E:0.081980 |  909

[3421.96 - 3425.72] P:1213.78 E:0.085523 |  And I think the guys gave a good answer today
[3427.00 - 3429.88] P:1470.39 E:0.116503 |  Yeah, it's interesting you say that Ralph in terms of a a good answer
[3429.88 - 3435.88] P:1356.00 E:0.104224 |  I mean if anyone wanted to watch Southampton today that last 20 minutes in particular showed the commitment to the cause do you feel?
[3436.84 - 3438.68] P:1200.37 E:0.115968 |  Yeah, but nothing else
[3438.68 - 3442.92] P:1185.39 E:0.105550 |  Was what I was expecting and if somebody else says something different
[3443.64 - 3445.64] P:1508.00 E:0.108739 |  Then I I should be careful
[3446.20 - 3449.56] P:1230.20 E:0.088891 |  Or you should be careful to spread this because
[3450.04 - 3456.44] P:1151.78 E:0.095577 |  Yeah, we know that this makes our life our life tougher my my job a little bit tougher, but uh
[3458.28 - 3462.92] P:833.64 E:0.098781 |  This the important thing is that is that I that I know what I have with my team
[3463.48 - 3466.84] P:1304.92 E:0.093784 |  Yeah, does that does that um noise those stories?
[3467.16 - 3470.44] P:1451.43 E:0.099714 |  Well, you say it makes your job tough and how difficult is that to ignore?

[3481.64 - 3483.88] P:1287.96 E:0.111025 |  Meanwhile, I must say it's a little bit annoying
[3484.60 - 3490.20] P:1130.78 E:0.106747 |  In social media and in all this this this stuff what is coming, but yeah, maybe you have to live with this
[3490.28 - 3493.64] P:1207.94 E:0.088281 |  This is our job. We know this normally. I don't want to speak about it
[3494.12 - 3497.56] P:1360.58 E:0.097781 |  It's always good to to give a reaction on the pitch and and I think they
[3498.68 - 3501.56] P:1088.12 E:0.108214 |  Look the team gave the answer today. Although we took only the point
[3502.36 - 3507.08] P:1856.89 E:0.098584 |  We heard from Gabriel J. Zeus earlier on sports report. He got two arsenal goals as they beat Leicester
[3507.72 - 3512.92] P:1751.58 E:0.091756 |  For two Brendan Rodgers afterwards was asked what he wants to happen at the club over the next few weeks
[3513.40 - 3517.96] P:1356.93 E:0.079507 |  You know, I can only really concentrate on the players that we have. I'm no different to mckell. I'm no different to
[3518.84 - 3525.56] P:1275.97 E:0.067608 |  The other managers that you know that you want to be at the top end of the table you you you got to invest and you got to
[3526.04 - 3528.04] P:1610.84 E:0.065933 |  to bring in quality however
[3528.52 - 3533.96] P:1382.80 E:0.069915 |  The club had been great for me my time. He and I respect that we can't do that. We're not able to do that so
[3534.84 - 3538.36] P:1770.33 E:0.062199 |  So like I say my concentration then has to fall on the players. It's here
[3538.68 - 3542.68] P:1351.55 E:0.071080 |  But everyone knows when you can bring in players and bring in players of quality
[3542.68 - 3545.72] P:1673.71 E:0.063568 |  It's not just what that they bring in. It's the lift it gives
[3546.28 - 3549.00] P:1441.86 E:0.069729 |  All the other players and that's obviously something that we've missed
[3549.64 - 3554.60] P:1554.81 E:0.080984 |  It sounds like you said you almost got to suffer a period of change to go and progress forward again
[3555.00 - 3560.12] P:1592.61 E:0.082523 |  I think so. I think the the club has always been stable. They've it's been ran ever so well
[3560.68 - 3561.96] P:1742.00 E:0.045403 |  um
[3561.96 - 3563.56] P:1772.71 E:0.082636 |  so uh, so yeah, so
[3564.04 - 3571.40] P:1502.71 E:0.072352 |  I trust them and they tell me there's no resources to to do anything as of yet then, uh, you know, I I believe them so
[3572.44 - 3577.48] P:1536.95 E:0.066964 |  We're not one of the big clubs that the the pandemic didn't affect it really affected us
[3577.96 - 3582.44] P:1213.82 E:0.074517 |  Like I say, we're we're increasing the stadium. We've got 100 million pound training facility
[3583.00 - 3585.00] P:1657.93 E:0.066736 |  and so for a club like us
[3585.16 - 3589.32] P:1552.36 E:0.062611 |  And and the resources that we have and that's a big big outlay. So
[3589.80 - 3594.68] P:1447.42 E:0.064145 |  But we're not at the level and that's why these players have done amazing over the the three odd years
[3594.76 - 3599.00] P:1282.56 E:0.065510 |  I've I've been here to be challenging for champions league and winning some trophies, you know
[3599.64 - 3601.64] P:1328.31 E:0.089106 |  But but at this moment in time
[3602.28 - 3606.84] P:1266.45 E:0.074784 |  We we can't then push on and get in more players because we don't have those resources
[3607.32 - 3611.08] P:1960.94 E:0.095722 |  Now let's go to molly new where it finished nil nil means Bruna largest side

[3622.12 - 3626.12] P:1747.24 E:0.085114 |  That's the balance that we need to grow up as a team because if we don't if we cannot
[3626.60 - 3631.88] P:1761.79 E:0.086539 |  Score goals at least we cannot concede or the other and or give chances to the opponent and in the end
[3631.88 - 3636.28] P:1618.82 E:0.076576 |  What you look for what you did all the game. I think we deserve the three points
[3636.76 - 3640.60] P:1540.12 E:0.081414 |  and when you come comes another time that you need to be in that point that
[3641.40 - 3646.28] P:1704.08 E:0.090446 |  Emotional control on it's important especially than I stand 15 minutes because the game were balanced
[3646.60 - 3651.88] P:1681.13 E:0.076243 |  I think with that period we have more fitness and and and strength than the opponent
[3652.04 - 3654.04] P:1608.32 E:0.078329 |  We need to keep going in our game
[3654.60 - 3658.92] P:1798.92 E:0.077302 |  Don't run as a as a crazy team, but stay focused stay in the game
[3659.24 - 3667.64] P:1677.30 E:0.079979 |  Keep control of the of the of the ball of the positions of the emotions and the goal will come and we don't concede spaces and chances for the opponent

[3681.32 - 3686.28] P:1656.91 E:0.090091 |  Sene Dieng here's his manager michael biel and he finished it really well. It's actually a really good technique
[3686.44 - 3692.20] P:1621.30 E:0.092120 |  So well played to him. He's very modest. So he's calmed down in there, but obviously his teammates making a fuss of him
[3692.36 - 3698.20] P:1491.12 E:0.084331 |  We're delighted. I thought just before that we had a wonderful opportunity with Sinclair Armstrong to equalize and we missed it
[3698.20 - 3700.20] P:1099.53 E:0.078770 |  And I thought that was the big moment gone
[3701.16 - 3705.40] P:1689.52 E:0.090117 |  Sene Dieng goes down the other end and makes a big save to secure the point. So that's it. He's
[3706.12 - 3711.08] P:1479.42 E:0.089294 |  I believe he's one of the best goalkeepers in this league. I think he's destined for really big things
[3711.64 - 3713.80] P:1020.36 E:0.082823 |  And we're delighted to have him as our goalkeeper
[3714.52 - 3717.16] P:1683.94 E:0.106959 |  Michael Biel don't forget you can see everything Premier League wise

[3744.20 - 3748.52] P:1801.11 E:0.084238 |  Yeah, just it's really i'm not here from leicester city fans tonight Manchester united, you know
[3748.68 - 3754.36] P:1794.58 E:0.081237 |  Clearly the biggest story in town, but just how despondent brennan rogers, you know was there can't bring in
[3755.08 - 3759.32] P:1642.98 E:0.068765 |  Any players of quality i'm not so sure he's going to be around much longer at least
[3759.40 - 3765.16] P:1739.48 E:0.086058 |  I don't think he's going to part with that. Let's talk about man. Just united rob. I mean where where do you stop?
[3765.16 - 3767.16] P:1886.22 E:0.090241 |  Can they turn it around the second?
[3768.12 - 3773.96] P:1614.43 E:0.079170 |  You're better than that, but I mean do you think ten harga's thinking blimey wide? Why did I bother?
[3774.04 - 3776.28] P:1575.48 E:0.072501 |  This isn't on ten harg, right? Or is it?
[3776.28 - 3778.28] P:1526.89 E:0.080086 |  No, of course not he needs a lot of time
[3778.28 - 3780.68] P:1463.75 E:0.076445 |  But you look at the way they're playing look at the structure of the team
[3780.68 - 3783.96] P:1738.79 E:0.080838 |  You look at the structure of the team last week christian ericsson players of force nine
[3784.04 - 3787.80] P:1546.77 E:0.105450 |  I don't know where that came from. So you're saying it's on ten harg? No last week before the team
[3788.12 - 3789.64] P:1597.01 E:0.093779 |  Structure of the team for me
[3789.64 - 3794.68] P:1567.72 E:0.081877 |  Obviously if you hear manchish united fans over the last couple of seasons we can't play with two number sixes today's gone with
[3795.56 - 3796.84] P:1779.07 E:0.070140 |  Fred is one six
[3796.84 - 3802.36] P:1554.27 E:0.084276 |  Then you've got five attacking players away from home five attacking players in the side you're wide wide open
[3802.36 - 3805.40] P:1649.49 E:0.081958 |  So I think it's massive. It's not ten harg's fault. He needs time
[3806.84 - 3807.96] P:1236.36 E:0.069799 |  Recruitment recruitment
[3808.04 - 3811.88] P:1555.97 E:0.081163 |  Let's me talk about in the show, but the recruitment over the years has been so so bad
[3812.44 - 3816.04] P:1768.18 E:0.069690 |  Where is rabbi on the list and out of it's who's who's evil?
[3816.68 - 3821.08] P:1528.98 E:0.080951 |  Where where are they on the list of my night when they're looking for players? I don't get it chris
[3821.08 - 3827.08] P:1794.36 E:0.069765 |  It's an absolute shambles, but ten harg needs time but brentford for nil chris
[3827.24 - 3834.36] P:1608.87 E:0.051020 |  Yeah, I mean incredible performance from from brentford, but where does this manchish united performance rank?
[3835.00 - 3840.36] P:1849.56 E:0.072047 |  Then in in the history of manchish united, where does that first 45 minutes rank?
[3840.44 - 3845.24] P:1824.41 E:0.079425 |  Let's hear from manchish united fans. Oh eight. Oh eight five nine nine six nine three
[3845.24 - 3848.20] P:1491.45 E:0.105501 |  Well john murray and glen murray there john. Where does this rank?
[3849.80 - 3853.32] P:1703.80 E:0.109399 |  Pretty low. I think I think you've picked the right word there robbie rank
[3854.68 - 3856.68] P:1654.67 E:0.105436 |  That's unusual
[3857.56 - 3861.24] P:1838.38 E:0.108943 |  And as I said in the first half chris you were too conservative with your predictions
[3861.40 - 3864.36] P:1932.16 E:0.108804 |  Yeah, well I went three now just off the back of last week
[3864.60 - 3868.76] P:1925.82 E:0.096553 |  You know, I thought it's going to be difficult for united to pick themselves up, but
[3869.56 - 3873.88] P:1781.33 E:0.105595 |  They've been pathetic. I tell you what I'll do. John if I was manchish tonight and I'd make a triple change
[3874.44 - 3878.84] P:1645.27 E:0.100616 |  I thought you might do that. Yeah. Well, that's very shrewd as ever
[3879.48 - 3883.24] P:1634.33 E:0.105734 |  Listen, um, enjoy the program right? Yeah, we'll be yeah
[3883.48 - 3887.16] P:1761.90 E:0.105901 |  We'll be giving it a push during the second half because there'll be plenty to talk about
[3887.48 - 3892.84] P:2042.34 E:0.109166 |  And and you know the other point is these manchish united fans those who've come down from the northwest of england
[3892.92 - 3896.60] P:1956.46 E:0.108963 |  You know with all of the travel problems today as well the train strike
[3897.24 - 3899.24] P:1804.56 E:0.113413 |  What a miserable experience from them
[3900.12 - 3901.24] P:1763.09 E:0.109746 |  but
[3901.24 - 3905.96] P:1889.10 E:0.109151 |  It's a triple change from eric tenhard at the start of the second half. So fred is off
[3906.68 - 3909.32] P:1787.70 E:0.109665 |  Shaw is off and martinez is off
[3910.20 - 3914.76] P:1851.93 E:0.105290 |  And the players who've come on as the second half begins with a scoreline of brendford four
[3915.24 - 3917.72] P:1744.34 E:0.086153 |  manchist united nil are
[3918.28 - 3919.80] P:1631.45 E:0.065821 |  mcdomenay
[3919.80 - 3924.76] P:1776.13 E:0.098361 |  molasia at left back and verand in central defense so a triple change but
[3925.56 - 3928.04] P:1537.24 E:0.105966 |  You know the the horse has bolted glenn moray
[3928.84 - 3931.64] P:1636.49 E:0.105361 |  Well the one change that I look at there
[3932.76 - 3934.12] P:1571.15 E:0.061675 |  and I'm
[3934.12 - 3936.12] P:1567.38 E:0.092994 |  well, I'm not surprised but
[3936.60 - 3938.12] P:1591.59 E:0.082388 |  Is martinez
[3938.12 - 3941.16] P:1581.93 E:0.096360 |  To to drag and I call it drag because that's what he's done
[3941.16 - 3945.32] P:1658.58 E:0.098356 |  He's dragged him off at halftime the shepherd took as we call it and bring verand on
[3946.04 - 3951.00] P:1627.64 E:0.086091 |  I think speaks absolute volumes of this manchish united group. Well
[3952.28 - 3954.84] P:1607.18 E:0.107873 |  He is he's new to the club martinez
[3955.56 - 3957.56] P:1553.87 E:0.109219 |  It's his second match as you'll be well aware
[3958.36 - 3962.20] P:1790.51 E:0.097446 |  They they spent something in the region of 47 million pounds
[3962.76 - 3969.08] P:1766.97 E:0.104463 |  And this was a player that eric tenhard knew extremely well because he was his player of the year
[3969.64 - 3973.08] P:1613.96 E:0.090861 |  At iac's last season when they won the league in holland
[3973.40 - 3977.64] P:1671.97 E:0.097810 |  I don't know there was there's quite a bit of talk before the game that verand might start this match
[3978.04 - 3980.36] P:1853.78 E:0.103610 |  So maybe there's been a decision there and he's decided
[3980.76 - 3985.64] P:1706.00 E:0.101835 |  You know now's the time to bring verand in because there've been fitness issues there as well
[3986.12 - 3988.12] P:1590.97 E:0.077223 |  Not that the down four nil
[3988.12 - 3989.32] P:1933.37 E:0.070480 |  well
[3989.32 - 3991.32] P:1732.17 E:0.110766 |  I mean you had to change something
[3991.56 - 3997.24] P:1589.65 E:0.105435 |  I I do feel for martinez because as soon as he's joined manchish united he's been questioned about his height
[3997.24 - 4001.56] P:1709.12 E:0.084004 |  Uh, that has got to affect you in in some capacity
[4002.12 - 4006.36] P:1537.05 E:0.098896 |  Even if it is subconsciously the things he's taken on board via his phone via
[4007.16 - 4008.28] P:1351.07 E:0.116841 |  Papers and things like that
[4008.28 - 4013.72] P:1509.00 E:0.092154 |  But then to be dragged by the man that brought you here at halftime in the second in your second start
[4014.12 - 4017.40] P:1635.29 E:0.083308 |  I mean his confidence must be absolutely rock bottom
[4018.60 - 4020.12] P:1595.66 E:0.074494 |  four nil
[4020.12 - 4022.12] P:1777.13 E:0.078120 |  Brentford red and white striped
[4022.20 - 4024.20] P:1904.08 E:0.102318 |  shirts black shorts black socks
[4025.16 - 4028.52] P:1838.94 E:0.100389 |  On the way to a famous victory one of their best
[4029.16 - 4031.16] P:1764.86 E:0.093368 |  four nil three on three and
[4031.48 - 4034.20] P:1860.80 E:0.106379 |  And berma trying to hit the pass early those
[4034.84 - 4038.68] P:1696.05 E:0.112377 |  Three players nor guard was in the middle toni was up there as well. They take a quick free kick
[4038.92 - 4040.84] P:1866.78 E:0.102494 |  Henry is onto this the left wing back
[4040.84 - 4045.64] P:1790.44 E:0.102010 |  He crosses and it's cleared away at the near post and out of play for a throwing to Brentford down the left
[4045.64 - 4047.88] P:1838.78 E:0.096264 |  They're playing from the the right to the left
[4048.52 - 4052.36] P:1738.63 E:0.101723 |  In the in the second half towards what we might call the sun end
[4052.76 - 4058.20] P:1613.34 E:0.098790 |  The sun is up there in the sky right behind that stand blazing down on west london
[4058.92 - 4063.24] P:1792.43 E:0.104973 |  Throw in ten yards back from the corner flag. So it is one of the Brentford specialities
[4063.40 - 4064.92] P:1811.10 E:0.077271 |  It's the long throw
[4064.92 - 4068.12] P:1745.19 E:0.094179 |  I'm anxious united going to be capable of dealing with it
[4069.32 - 4071.88] P:1586.43 E:0.112601 |  Jensen is right up against the advertising hoardings
[4072.28 - 4075.16] P:1726.64 E:0.109049 |  Here he comes the long throw spear into the near post me got a touch
[4075.40 - 4079.88] P:1744.24 E:0.089716 |  And it was cleared away near the edge of the box by finandez and Brentford start again
[4079.88 - 4083.56] P:1675.42 E:0.099738 |  So Brentford as they were in the first half as you would expect raya in goal. He's
[4084.28 - 4089.40] P:1749.60 E:0.104155 |  Clearing it downfield now and it's headed out of play by dallow the three central defenders roerslav
[4089.80 - 4096.60] P:1736.14 E:0.097049 |  Jansen and me Hickey on the right Henry on the left and nor guard and Jensen and berma and disilva
[4097.00 - 4104.36] P:1804.17 E:0.105318 |  And toni as the central striker and Manchester united their rejig team at halftime. I'll run you through that
[4105.00 - 4109.40] P:1725.60 E:0.101626 |  But they've got to throw in again Brentford this one's taken short by Jensen. He gets it back crosses it in
[4109.40 - 4114.04] P:1751.90 E:0.095709 |  It's cleared out to Henry who chips it back out to Jensen on the left hand side
[4114.44 - 4119.96] P:1710.80 E:0.098092 |  Jensen is up against the newly arrived mcdomen a takes him on towards the the dead ball line on the left hand side
[4119.96 - 4123.16] P:1775.73 E:0.091937 |  But mcdomen a has managed to get a foot in and clear it back up the line
[4123.48 - 4128.04] P:1796.60 E:0.108803 |  And it eventually bounces off mcdomen a and behind the corner to Brentford. That's a cheap one
[4128.44 - 4131.64] P:1741.60 E:0.097776 |  It was actually a pass back from sancho that tried to find
[4132.28 - 4134.28] P:1680.81 E:0.106090 |  mcdomen a just missed him and it rolls
[4134.76 - 4139.16] P:1745.16 E:0.096564 |  Pathetically out for a Brentford corner and their two players exchanged looks of
[4140.28 - 4146.20] P:1562.37 E:0.102507 |  Disillusion daggers. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah daggers. Yeah, they they uh, I mean that sums it up
[4146.28 - 4149.32] P:1617.14 E:0.099922 |  It's another one of those days for Manchester united
[4150.04 - 4155.32] P:1560.64 E:0.105315 |  I mentioned the fact that this will be Brentford's first win against Manchester united since before the second world war
[4155.96 - 4161.24] P:1663.44 E:0.097401 |  There's more on that because Brentford have got this corner first which Jensen takes into the near post
[4161.24 - 4165.40] P:1835.68 E:0.099154 |  It's bounced a long way out towards the far side of the penalty area Tony gives it to the right
[4165.48 - 4169.80] P:1796.39 E:0.103469 |  It's driven into the near post and Dehaio is able to get down there and block it with his legs
[4170.28 - 4173.72] P:1626.65 E:0.110689 |  United scrape it away and then Tony out there on the right has a right
[4173.96 - 4178.20] P:1803.72 E:0.101650 |  Lash at it with his right foot and it flashes wide and behind into the Brentford fans
[4178.28 - 4184.12] P:1630.14 E:0.102957 |  And you know what if Tony was a little bit more composed there and just felt that ball back into the back into the area
[4184.76 - 4187.16] P:1450.94 E:0.096796 |  Brentford had three players on the backstick
[4187.16 - 4190.84] P:1425.38 E:0.104723 |  He would it headed into an empty goal a little bit of a composure from Brentford
[4191.24 - 4195.56] P:1432.21 E:0.100965 |  And it could have been five as and since uh since Brentford last beat Manchester United
[4195.64 - 4203.24] P:1665.25 E:0.103923 |  Which as I say was back in there and an FA cup tie in 1938 in all of the games they've played and there have not been that many six
[4203.80 - 4209.16] P:1640.99 E:0.101734 |  Uh wins for united one draw in all of the matches they've played since the second world war
[4210.04 - 4212.04] P:1596.12 E:0.101743 |  Brentford have scored more goals in this match
[4212.84 - 4217.24] P:1594.62 E:0.094492 |  Than they've scored in all of the games they've played against Manchester united put together
[4217.80 - 4219.80] P:1489.84 E:0.089678 |  since the second world war
[4220.76 - 4226.84] P:1634.47 E:0.099255 |  So uh united I mean it's it's one damning fact and statistic after another but here they come now
[4227.64 - 4232.60] P:1765.75 E:0.107670 |  Trying to do something about this dallow chips it in and it's headed down and wide by Cristiano Ronaldo
[4232.68 - 4237.40] P:1793.78 E:0.103067 |  He had to he had to stoop. He was slightly behind ahead of it, but headed it wide
[4237.96 - 4241.08] P:1577.88 E:0.109747 |  On the bounce I think by his own personal standards
[4241.80 - 4243.80] P:1590.30 E:0.092010 |  Ronaldo should be scoring there
[4244.12 - 4247.96] P:1623.09 E:0.103500 |  He watches the ball in no one gets in the way of it. It's right onto his head. Yes granted
[4247.96 - 4255.48] P:1664.62 E:0.096667 |  It might be slightly behind him, but a player is ilk can change his body shape just slightly and feel that back on go on target
[4256.20 - 4258.28] P:1534.33 E:0.097860 |  And I think when he sees that back tonight, I'll be disappointed
[4258.28 - 4263.00] P:1612.50 E:0.088923 |  But I don't think it'll make much difference to the outcome five live and bbc sounds
[4264.20 - 4268.52] P:1750.73 E:0.096255 |  Four nil to Brentford the goals from De Silva. That was a De here era
[4269.40 - 4271.64] P:1657.08 E:0.105149 |  Uh Jensen that was a christian ericsson
[4271.96 - 4274.36] P:1585.53 E:0.101225 |  Era he was caught on the ball in his own penalty area
[4274.52 - 4276.52] P:1489.63 E:0.099492 |  Ben me then in the aftermath of a corner
[4276.92 - 4281.80] P:1672.32 E:0.096051 |  And then brian umbermo scoring the fourth on the counter attack after manchester united had the ball
[4282.36 - 4290.20] P:1777.73 E:0.097499 |  Down the other end so four nil it is and united in these rather sickly yellowy green shirts sickly
[4290.20 - 4296.36] P:1698.04 E:0.097838 |  All right, here's sancho sancho a change of feet and then again, but it's all rather laboured
[4296.76 - 4304.20] P:1736.79 E:0.099312 |  Bruno Fernandez is behind him Bruno Fernandez crosses right footed right across the penalty area hiki follows it out there with rashford
[4304.60 - 4306.60] P:1824.87 E:0.095454 |  rashford works it back to
[4308.76 - 4310.12] P:1863.75 E:0.089148 |  Malacia
[4310.12 - 4312.12] P:1846.45 E:0.100876 |  the uh the new left back
[4312.52 - 4318.76] P:1643.66 E:0.101905 |  And then scott mcdomenay chips it to the right corner of the box to dallol left footed ball in from him and the header from rinaldo
[4319.64 - 4322.52] P:1618.01 E:0.107827 |  10 yards out 12 yards out lands on the roof of the net
[4323.00 - 4325.24] P:1509.57 E:0.110405 |  again rinaldo man of his standards
[4325.96 - 4329.96] P:1525.18 E:0.096574 |  The ball comes in from the same side dallol swings it with his left foot
[4330.20 - 4336.20] P:1657.54 E:0.090549 |  He feels it towards gull and that is mightily closer dropping in that top corner of david reyer's gull
[4336.68 - 4337.88] P:1669.92 E:0.100000 |  Landed on the roof of the net though
[4337.88 - 4344.60] P:1681.24 E:0.099359 |  So the manchester united team now glenn in the second half to here in gull gallo maguire verran and malacia
[4345.00 - 4349.96] P:1746.28 E:0.096222 |  So two substitutes in the back four then scott mcdomenay with bruno fernandez and christian ericsson
[4350.44 - 4352.44] P:1814.38 E:0.103693 |  santo and rashford in the wide positions
[4352.68 - 4357.80] P:1759.65 E:0.097157 |  And rinaldo up front so i rick tenhard making one change from last week's starting lineup
[4357.80 - 4361.64] P:1705.77 E:0.093912 |  But now making three changes at halftime and another thing as well glenn
[4362.60 - 4369.24] P:1722.65 E:0.091196 |  Must mention is i just thought as well having had a week to work with manchester united this week to build up
[4370.28 - 4372.04] P:1810.86 E:0.077933 |  to this game
[4372.04 - 4376.44] P:1648.88 E:0.095174 |  For for that reason almost alone. I was expecting more of manchester united
[4377.16 - 4379.80] P:1290.76 E:0.095288 |  And this is all the more damning in the light of that
[4380.28 - 4384.60] P:1598.39 E:0.097084 |  There's no guard plays it forward and then back it goes to the halfway line russ left
[4385.32 - 4387.32] P:1730.42 E:0.083109 |  to the right brendford
[4387.80 - 4389.24] P:1769.41 E:0.087607 |  lose possession
[4389.24 - 4394.76] P:1627.18 E:0.100900 |  And it's won back by bruno fernandez who passes it to rashford on the halfway line and rashford passes it down the line
[4394.84 - 4398.28] P:1814.16 E:0.093190 |  But there's no way bruno fernandez is reaching that took a deflection though
[4398.28 - 4401.96] P:1747.30 E:0.097536 |  It's out of play for a throwing two manchester united rashford played it off the defender
[4402.04 - 4407.16] P:1437.13 E:0.100383 |  I mean that that that piece of play there was a knight he was nice little link up between rinaldo and fernandez
[4407.80 - 4410.52] P:1596.10 E:0.091798 |  But when that gets passed back to fernandez and he's looking forward
[4410.52 - 4415.24] P:1604.46 E:0.096307 |  There's no one in front of him no one's breaking their neck to to get behind that brendford line and santo
[4415.24 - 4418.12] P:1642.61 E:0.092360 |  I watched on this opposite side just canter into the middle
[4418.12 - 4422.44] P:1725.10 E:0.094596 |  He didn't even try to make a run forward and that's what manchester united lack
[4422.76 - 4426.84] P:1736.42 E:0.099865 |  Here is rashford might get away down the left that cuts back onto his right foot and
[4427.24 - 4432.44] P:1670.97 E:0.098761 |  In that moment russ left is onto him and puts in the block and the ball bounces away towards the halfway line
[4432.92 - 4434.92] P:1823.78 E:0.074173 |  and he's sweltering conditions
[4435.48 - 4439.80] P:1668.99 E:0.097237 |  The players around about two-thirds of the pitch is in this bright sunshine
[4440.28 - 4444.28] P:1688.78 E:0.104286 |  And sancho now moving in from the right hand side gives it to rinaldo square from him
[4444.36 - 4446.92] P:1853.97 E:0.096804 |  fernandez allows it to run malaccio is going to try a shot
[4446.92 - 4452.76] P:1681.26 E:0.099304 |  But it hits russ left inside the penalty area and bounces away for brendford to clear up to to tony on the halfway line
[4452.84 - 4456.60] P:1716.65 E:0.094526 |  tony battling with maguire who who does win the header against
[4457.24 - 4458.36] P:1640.11 E:0.064288 |  tony
[4458.36 - 4464.84] P:1708.29 E:0.108249 |  Oh, and that was very nearly unburmours onto that ericsson was just able to take it away from his former teammate christian ericsson
[4465.24 - 4467.72] P:1592.20 E:0.102462 |  And gives it out to the left hand side ericsson gets it back
[4468.28 - 4470.52] P:1507.32 E:0.104321 |  rinaldo ten yards inside the brendford half
[4471.16 - 4473.16] P:1719.79 E:0.096884 |  and I think this half obviously
[4473.72 - 4475.64] P:1611.88 E:0.109742 |  thomas franken in the dressing about half time
[4475.64 - 4478.36] P:1642.45 E:0.100045 |  I think the biggest he would have to do is calm his players down
[4479.08 - 4482.28] P:1830.39 E:0.105307 |  He has dallow now into the penalty area on the right hand side chips it across
[4482.28 - 4487.40] P:1698.80 E:0.099896 |  But chips it wide and over the top of the crossbar and behind goal kick for nil brendford glenn murray
[4487.56 - 4489.16] P:1643.45 E:0.084687 |  I just I just picking up on that point
[4489.16 - 4494.68] P:1529.00 E:0.103168 |  I was making of thomas franken and calm and his players down. I mean they must be an absolute dreamland right now and
[4495.72 - 4499.96] P:1684.36 E:0.109368 |  They've got in there. I mean they must have been pretty pretty hyped at halftime
[4499.96 - 4506.44] P:1631.01 E:0.107731 |  And I think his job is we need to manage this game boys. Take this thing out of it. We don't need to score again
[4506.84 - 4514.76] P:1687.71 E:0.098344 |  We just need to control as much as we can and keep our heads when we're in such an ascended ascended position
[4515.88 - 4522.76] P:1665.55 E:0.102577 |  Well, it's it's red hot and it should be red hot for callers on 606 tonight after this manchester united supporters
[4524.20 - 4531.80] P:1800.58 E:0.096542 |  You'll want to talk to to robbie and to chris you can book your calls now on 0808 5 9 0 9 6 9 3

[4544.76 - 4552.76] P:1684.77 E:0.095204 |  Of course on the bbc sport website and app and then the highlights on match of the day tonight on bbc one and as we've suggested
[4553.64 - 4556.20] P:1509.93 E:0.107289 |  This will be top of the bill. I don't think there's any doubt about that
[4556.60 - 4560.12] P:1698.51 E:0.103203 |  No, I don't think there is and just chatting about erik ten hags
[4560.76 - 4566.04] P:1632.19 E:0.103336 |  And substitutions at halftime and I understand melasia a new player coming into the football club
[4566.44 - 4569.48] P:1639.36 E:0.101673 |  I kind of understand verand just to show that back line up, but
[4570.84 - 4574.92] P:1714.87 E:0.099043 |  Why not bring vander beek on he's he's former player big question mark for me
[4575.48 - 4580.12] P:1645.91 E:0.104087 |  I thought he would have been one of the first on the team sheet when I seen erik ten hag become the manchester united manager
[4580.92 - 4582.92] P:1640.54 E:0.112417 |  and another thing he's brought players on that
[4583.80 - 4590.12] P:1640.27 E:0.103452 |  Can I say tried and tested he's seen them. He's seen what they can do. Why not bring ganache on why not bring a languron?
[4591.08 - 4593.08] P:1794.20 E:0.081761 |  Well, we might see them yet
[4593.32 - 4596.76] P:1798.73 E:0.107912 |  But it is brentford who come forward after manchester united lost possession
[4597.08 - 4603.48] P:1851.32 E:0.102364 |  But melasia was able to close down the attempted crossing it bounces behind for a corner to brentford
[4603.88 - 4610.52] P:1692.75 E:0.090890 |  And they've been so effective in I mean the plans talk about plans coming together. I mean that has happened
[4611.08 - 4616.04] P:1613.82 E:0.098058 |  Time and time again for brentford while manchester united's best-laid plans
[4616.76 - 4618.76] P:1879.55 E:0.095520 |  have fallen apart
[4619.56 - 4623.50] P:1734.32 E:0.105081 |  And jensen and and bermaul walk together
[4624.84 - 4629.48] P:1593.14 E:0.105887 |  Something almost romantic about that, isn't it the way that they walked holding the ball almost together
[4629.80 - 4632.76] P:1637.78 E:0.101007 |  Applauded by all of those fans in the lovely warm sunshine here
[4634.44 - 4636.44] P:1642.98 E:0.085119 |  moments to remember
[4636.52 - 4637.72] P:1750.75 E:0.070658 |  And bermaul
[4637.72 - 4640.28] P:1728.62 E:0.105567 |  And jensen it is jensen who takes this one
[4640.28 - 4643.64] P:1739.58 E:0.102020 |  It's a deep corner towards the back post and tony very nearly
[4644.20 - 4648.44] P:1688.66 E:0.107059 |  Got himself and it was only erikson who spotted him at the last moment who came across with a saving head
[4648.44 - 4650.84] P:1687.05 E:0.100244 |  I'd have put it behind from a for a corner from the other side
[4651.08 - 4657.56] P:1604.63 E:0.094864 |  Yes, the ball was quite high and tony was in a standing position just waiting for the ball to fall and it wouldn't quite fall quick enough
[4657.56 - 4664.84] P:1652.83 E:0.100940 |  He was willing it onto his head and as he was doing that erikson saw the danger and just nipped in to give brentford another corner
[4665.08 - 4670.20] P:1681.13 E:0.107000 |  And it's lovely again from bermaul and and jensen they're able to walk all the way across the pitch together and
[4670.76 - 4676.68] P:1521.72 E:0.102921 |  And get applauded all the way over. Well, I don't think those two players could be any happier on a football field right now john
[4677.32 - 4679.80] P:1688.22 E:0.105840 |  So who's going to take this one jensen or and bermaul?
[4679.96 - 4683.96] P:1645.89 E:0.095147 |  They're both standing off the pitch as that usual brentford movement inside the area
[4683.96 - 4689.48] P:1732.59 E:0.099016 |  It's jensen to the back post which is hooked away by rashford who was there and it's cleared further away by melasia
[4689.72 - 4691.64] P:1691.05 E:0.106677 |  On the edge of the box they're looking to break
[4691.72 - 4695.80] P:1923.47 E:0.104070 |  But it's and bermaul who gets there first ahead of jaden sancho
[4696.04 - 4700.60] P:1771.36 E:0.100253 |  The man who's just been involved in the taking of the corner snuffs out the manchester united counterattack
[4701.32 - 4705.40] P:1672.85 E:0.105000 |  And then ryer's able to fire a ball away downfield to start another brentford attack
[4705.96 - 4709.64] P:1811.36 E:0.107694 |  Which results in a throw in for the home side brentford for
[4710.04 - 4714.84] P:1792.43 E:0.094281 |  Manchester united nil if you've just switched on if you've been out involving the sunshine
[4715.08 - 4719.32] P:1690.57 E:0.095226 |  If you maybe just got back into the car you've been at the beach. You've not really been paying attention
[4720.20 - 4722.20] P:1812.01 E:0.098472 |  It's brentford for
[4722.60 - 4724.60] P:1689.75 E:0.095235 |  Manchester united nil
[4724.92 - 4725.96] P:1835.43 E:0.093106 |  for nil
[4725.96 - 4727.96] P:1929.13 E:0.084934 |  Yep for nil
[4728.28 - 4734.92] P:1649.09 E:0.105354 |  And it's a throwing for the home side cheered on by their supporters just their second season back in the premier league
[4735.48 - 4741.72] P:1647.02 E:0.111081 |  And here they are looking for what would be an extraordinary fifth goal and bermaul was very nearly in but melasia was able to put in the challenge
[4741.72 - 4743.72] P:1718.27 E:0.081520 |  And actually the flag was up against
[4743.96 - 4748.12] P:1758.95 E:0.097336 |  brian and bermaul and it's a free kick to Manchester united glenn murray
[4748.44 - 4749.64] P:1760.72 E:0.088303 |  We talk about
[4749.64 - 4753.56] P:1715.38 E:0.103325 |  Well at halftime we talked about a manchester united reaction. Didn't we if anything
[4754.12 - 4756.92] P:1681.55 E:0.107448 |  It's brentford that looked like they're going to extend their lead even more
[4756.92 - 4760.44] P:1721.87 E:0.101339 |  There's been no reaction from manchester united all the substitutes they've brought in
[4761.24 - 4762.68] P:1843.50 E:0.084014 |  as we see
[4762.68 - 4763.72] P:1636.75 E:0.084321 |  sancho
[4763.72 - 4768.04] P:1706.01 E:0.097514 |  Exit the field of play and bring on antonyla langer. So that comes immediately after
[4768.68 - 4775.40] P:1591.26 E:0.103448 |  Sancho was beaten by unbermaul there. Yeah the last action that manchester united had in the in the brentford half
[4775.64 - 4776.44] P:1693.20 E:0.071209 |  it was
[4776.44 - 4781.16] P:1613.51 E:0.100263 |  Basically, I would I would class it as a foot race between sancho
[4781.88 - 4783.72] P:1675.24 E:0.068728 |  and unbermaul
[4783.72 - 4786.84] P:1504.37 E:0.103924 |  And I think it boiled down to who wanted it more than it was unbermaul. He got there
[4787.16 - 4792.76] P:1668.42 E:0.097436 |  He made sure he got the ball. He took it from sancho. He was probably at one point in that race ahead of him
[4793.56 - 4799.32] P:1557.61 E:0.099842 |  And it just I mean those are the problems manchester united have and he boils down to that. I think hunger
[4800.60 - 4802.60] P:1641.57 E:0.093960 |  So sancho is off
[4803.40 - 4807.48] P:1709.04 E:0.106273 |  That's the the fourth change of the five that eric ten harg can make
[4808.04 - 4811.00] P:1590.55 E:0.104992 |  His team are four nil down. Alanga is on for sancho
[4811.48 - 4817.24] P:1664.84 E:0.093244 |  Alanga who are so score here last season when manchester united actually won three one in that match. They were
[4818.12 - 4823.56] P:1681.81 E:0.099718 |  Three nil up. Tony scored a late goal. I remember they came into that with a bit of pressure on them manchester united but
[4824.20 - 4830.76] P:1688.01 E:0.093261 |  Stood up to him on that occasion, but the fact is so often now they come into matches when there is pressure on them
[4831.72 - 4833.96] P:1711.70 E:0.098699 |  And very often they don't come look for the mark
[4834.36 - 4837.80] P:1591.50 E:0.095400 |  I remember playing manchester united teams in my career and
[4838.36 - 4841.24] P:1574.06 E:0.097600 |  You looked at them in the tunnel and they seemed like giants
[4841.96 - 4845.08] P:1521.82 E:0.094538 |  You were almost beaten by the badge before you went on on the field of play
[4845.08 - 4851.08] P:1704.96 E:0.102711 |  But now they've lost that for you factor manchester united as a football club regardless of how big they are
[4851.32 - 4855.40] P:1818.95 E:0.100154 |  How big their stadium is they're not a scary prospect anymore
[4856.20 - 4861.72] P:1885.48 E:0.109478 |  And uh a ponderous manchester united attack comes to an end with malacia caught in an offside position
[4862.52 - 4864.12] P:2000.96 E:0.101277 |  and
[4864.12 - 4866.12] P:1993.34 E:0.110622 |  This is brentford's first change
[4867.56 - 4872.36] P:1910.54 E:0.106696 |  And it is vitally janel the uh the german
[4873.40 - 4876.44] P:1921.89 E:0.111692 |  midfielder who is going to come on for josh the silver
[4877.08 - 4883.64] P:1724.45 E:0.108051 |  Who's had a brilliant start to the season after all of the problems that he's had you you might have been hearing or reading about him last weekend
[4883.64 - 4885.64] P:1898.33 E:0.097606 |  This hip injury that he had
[4885.88 - 4891.40] P:1848.29 E:0.103362 |  Four months on crutches then had a hamstring injury last season and he walks off the field now
[4892.04 - 4895.48] P:1914.52 E:0.100147 |  You know great ovation thomas frank shakes his hand
[4896.36 - 4899.96] P:1731.52 E:0.105115 |  Scored the opening goal today. It's been a lovely day in the sunshine for him
[4904.36 - 4909.64] P:1606.99 E:0.106788 |  So vitally or vitally they're singing his name the number 27
[4910.60 - 4912.60] P:1714.65 E:0.078778 |  who uh
[4912.76 - 4916.60] P:1602.16 E:0.102250 |  Has got a sniff i think of getting into the german squad for the world cup another
[4917.08 - 4919.96] P:1706.84 E:0.106392 |  Hansy flick has supposedly been interested been to watch him
[4920.68 - 4922.52] P:1743.36 E:0.062204 |  so uh
[4922.52 - 4927.16] P:1710.80 E:0.106474 |  That is one with the world cup not too far away will be there and bringing all of that to you
[4927.64 - 4933.24] P:1653.07 E:0.093012 |  I suspect some days glenn in kata it might be cooler than it is here in brentford
[4933.80 - 4939.32] P:1626.84 E:0.100062 |  Maybe yes quite possibly but i think some of the stadiums if not all of them are air conditioned over there
[4939.32 - 4942.52] P:1539.96 E:0.091332 |  So that will be uh, that'll be quite nice from our point of view won't it john?
[4942.60 - 4949.80] P:1661.47 E:0.090481 |  It will yan elton's uh, slotted into that defensive midfield role, but manchester united coming forward with bruno finandez
[4950.36 - 4953.08] P:1714.78 E:0.112842 |  Four nil down manchester united rashford goes one way
[4953.88 - 4959.56] P:1770.33 E:0.104526 |  He comes short finandez passes the ball long it rolls past rashford runs out of play
[4960.12 - 4962.12] P:1687.70 E:0.098369 |  bruno finandez is is talking
[4963.32 - 4969.08] P:1654.54 E:0.102253 |  And talking and looking at rashford and waving his arms and telling him what he expected and now he's got his palms apart
[4969.48 - 4971.32] P:1780.76 E:0.082223 |  rashford's ignoring him
[4971.32 - 4974.44] P:1697.88 E:0.092235 |  That is not a good look from manchester united glenn murray
[4975.40 - 4977.40] P:1581.91 E:0.125209 |  No, and you mentioned those two players there
[4978.20 - 4985.24] P:1517.02 E:0.103483 |  That's just one of the problems. I mean it's right throughout this manchester united team. They're looking at one another. There's no cohesion. There's no understanding
[4986.20 - 4988.36] P:1695.42 E:0.096065 |  The question is is there a plan?
[4989.88 - 4993.00] P:1577.91 E:0.095828 |  Well, if there's not a plan that man down there in the gray
[4993.96 - 4998.76] P:1751.08 E:0.092018 |  Short sleeved shirt the black trousers the shaven head the dutchman eric ten hag
[4999.24 - 5002.60] P:1703.62 E:0.089852 |  He's got to find it. He's got to find a plan an effective plan
[5003.24 - 5006.92] P:1644.12 E:0.091816 |  One problem with that plan is manchester united's next match
[5007.56 - 5010.44] P:1665.37 E:0.098827 |  A week on monday is at home to libra pool
[5011.72 - 5014.04] P:1683.60 E:0.105603 |  christian erickson passing the ball forward into the
[5014.76 - 5018.28] P:1655.14 E:0.088209 |  Brentford half a langa comes short and then plays it back
[5018.84 - 5024.52] P:1681.32 E:0.099138 |  To the ran out to the left hand side to rinaldo who's dropped deep and is going to have a run at the Brentford defense
[5025.00 - 5027.00] P:1715.99 E:0.093904 |  It comes the challenge from yan elth who?
[5028.36 - 5030.36] P:1705.89 E:0.094016 |  forces rinaldo to
[5030.60 - 5034.36] P:1662.77 E:0.098263 |  Use mcdomon a and now the ball played out towards the left hand side
[5034.92 - 5039.64] P:1521.53 E:0.104032 |  Again, molasia is there the home supporters. It's party time in the stands in the home sections
[5040.12 - 5044.60] P:1709.27 E:0.109737 |  Manchester united fans. They had a huge anti-glazer banner by the way at halftime
[5044.68 - 5048.84] P:1709.16 E:0.097096 |  Which i guess they brought with them in any case because that's very much a theme of the moment
[5048.84 - 5054.84] P:1758.61 E:0.095733 |  But it was particularly pertinent when the team were four-nil down to brentford to unveil that in the stands
[5054.84 - 5057.40] P:1656.04 E:0.104669 |  You'll see pictures of that. I'm sure on social media
[5057.88 - 5063.72] P:1705.01 E:0.100717 |  Erickson playing a long pass over the top of dallow's running through and bouncing for a goal kick four-nil brentford
[5064.60 - 5068.52] P:1591.91 E:0.103731 |  and a big theme of this game john that we've sat here and watched this afternoon is
[5069.40 - 5073.96] P:1507.99 E:0.104167 |  brentford basically allowing manchester united to have the football and retreating into
[5074.60 - 5076.60] P:1646.92 E:0.098863 |  What can be described as
[5076.60 - 5083.72] P:1584.24 E:0.098746 |  One bank or two banks of four and just being hard to break down and basically manchester united not having the quality
[5084.68 - 5088.60] P:1622.61 E:0.100713 |  To be able to break them down and shooting from distance shooting through bodies and
[5089.72 - 5092.20] P:1717.87 E:0.100509 |  Basically brentford had just frustrated them into submission
[5093.48 - 5100.52] P:1837.68 E:0.095655 |  Brentford four-nil up but on the back foot now christian erickson turns looks faces the play plays it into the path of dallow
[5101.48 - 5107.88] P:1887.75 E:0.094206 |  Long floodlight shadow cast across the pitch at the feet of dallow and now plays the ball into tony
[5108.28 - 5111.80] P:1629.97 E:0.102991 |  But it bounces to maguire mcdomenay middle of the brentford half
[5112.28 - 5115.80] P:1674.73 E:0.100766 |  Stands up tall and plays the ball to the left hand side rashford afflicted by finandez
[5115.80 - 5121.24] P:1728.59 E:0.093874 |  But behind ronaldo and ben me was able to stretch in and and clear it away rashford
[5122.04 - 5127.56] P:1792.72 E:0.108136 |  Turn so there's a little touch from him there brunner finandez now down by the byline the defender slides in nor guard
[5127.80 - 5133.72] P:1760.64 E:0.092515 |  To put it behind from manchester united corner this is manchester united's first corner of the match
[5134.60 - 5136.92] P:1754.60 E:0.103304 |  With an hour and five minutes played
[5137.96 - 5139.96] P:1741.51 E:0.090515 |  And it actually looks
[5139.96 - 5145.32] P:1591.24 E:0.100470 |  As we see erickson just about to take this corner the manchester united fans having quite a bit of fun in that corner
[5145.48 - 5152.28] P:1684.12 E:0.099892 |  Yeah, they are uh, they're serenading erickson in there and the corner from him is over the top of brunner finandez
[5152.28 - 5154.28] P:1852.00 E:0.083822 |  Who then fells ben me
[5154.36 - 5157.88] P:1780.51 E:0.106444 |  As he's challenging for the ball he disputes that runa finandez
[5157.88 - 5163.32] P:1735.32 E:0.093422 |  It's a free kick to brentford who continue to leave for nil and the lines are open now for
[5163.88 - 5167.00] P:1642.52 E:0.101119 |  606 with robby savage and chris sutton from round about half past seven
[5167.48 - 5173.88] P:1599.60 E:0.099912 |  08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 one match being played actually in the national league at the moment last i looked it was olden nil

[5196.76 - 5201.88] P:1824.77 E:0.104351 |  Diagonal run across the box turns crosses towards the header from erickson, but diving was right
[5202.44 - 5204.84] P:1941.54 E:0.108030 |  Ryre is able to catch the ball

[5230.04 - 5233.08] P:1739.36 E:0.108953 |  Of him and it's quite a nice head. He's probably didn't have enough power on it and
[5233.64 - 5238.28] P:1705.09 E:0.102976 |  Rayo dives across to his right and caught it comfortably enough as we see the players

[5243.64 - 5247.00] P:1681.10 E:0.103907 |  So they've had that header from erickson. There was a rinaldo shot in the first half
[5247.32 - 5250.76] P:1563.03 E:0.095436 |  I think that's eight in terms of attempts on target from manchester united. Oh, yeah

[5292.44 - 5298.60] P:1596.09 E:0.095672 |  And that was that was john Chapman. I don't know if he was any relation. I doubt it because he's a scotsman
[5299.08 - 5302.68] P:1649.31 E:0.099356 |  That was they were his first two matches as the manchester united manager
[5302.76 - 5307.64] P:1551.19 E:0.094226 |  That was back in 1921 and no united manager since then has lost his first two matches
[5308.52 - 5312.12] P:1492.53 E:0.096768 |  So, uh, well done. I don't know when you had the time to look that up clen

[5371.80 - 5376.44] P:1582.38 E:0.094175 |  I just wonder if this was a boxing match if they would have thrown the towel in by this stage
[5378.36 - 5379.56] P:1746.80 E:0.077628 |  Well, I think
[5379.56 - 5382.04] P:1652.21 E:0.103042 |  being iced towel if they were going to throw a towel in

[5400.52 - 5406.36] P:1465.63 E:0.104267 |  I mean as as we speak in there they're blasting out united on never die and and and they are the people that keep football clubs alive
[5406.36 - 5409.56] P:1634.79 E:0.091526 |  Is this the supporters and this right here right now?
[5409.64 - 5414.68] P:1570.77 E:0.097869 |  He's probably the lowest ebb that most of those guys have ever seen in in manchester united history
[5415.64 - 5417.64] P:1683.77 E:0.104294 |  And I think he it just got past the point
[5418.44 - 5421.24] P:1583.00 E:0.101303 |  That they're not frustrated. They're not disappointing anymore
[5421.80 - 5427.40] P:1510.85 E:0.097706 |  They've just said let's have let's have a sing song and let's have a good afternoon and try and enjoy the sunshine in the sunshine

[5432.44 - 5433.88] P:1578.17 E:0.084555 |  But it's been a
[5433.88 - 5436.60] P:1793.03 E:0.112768 |  It's been a tough 10 years 10 years next year
[5437.32 - 5441.48] P:1632.17 E:0.096901 |  Since they last won the premier league went to alex ferguson retired with that
[5442.12 - 5444.12] P:1644.27 E:0.090731 |  final blaze of glory
[5444.20 - 5446.20] P:1811.66 E:0.099922 |  but they're four nil down to
[5446.76 - 5452.12] P:1583.15 E:0.098420 |  To brentford so brentford are equaling their record their record win against manchester united
[5452.12 - 5456.12] P:1749.92 E:0.095182 |  Here's finna and there's though trying to reduce the deficit giving it a rash foot on the left hand side rash
[5456.12 - 5461.16] P:1692.47 E:0.094550 |  Fords cross that's headed away by jansen in the middle pontus jansen comes out to mcdomen air
[5461.64 - 5465.96] P:1618.46 E:0.099987 |  25 yards out but brentford have got every single one of the red and white stripes back behind the ball
[5465.96 - 5470.20] P:1590.63 E:0.093778 |  So it is so congested in there and now malacia crosses from the left hand side
[5470.20 - 5474.76] P:1739.29 E:0.095807 |  It's over the top of elanga just wonder whether he might have been impeded by henry in the box
[5474.76 - 5477.48] P:1661.97 E:0.090363 |  He went sprawling couldn't reach it. There were no appeals
[5477.88 - 5482.04] P:1577.79 E:0.100304 |  Dallow with the outside of his boot plays it back towards the halfway line and now he has for an
[5483.08 - 5485.08] P:1574.20 E:0.102133 |  Rafa for an after all of his
[5485.16 - 5487.16] P:1546.99 E:0.111068 |  medal collecting with rail madrid
[5487.88 - 5490.84] P:1677.96 E:0.101617 |  There's no prospect of things improving in his second season
[5491.48 - 5492.92] P:1704.41 E:0.077964 |  and malacia
[5492.92 - 5499.32] P:1632.27 E:0.096542 |  Just miscontrolled that ball had to take it out had to race out to the left hand side and then gives it back to a little figure of christian erickson
[5499.96 - 5503.24] P:1590.43 E:0.096125 |  So important for brentford last season 11 appearances
[5503.88 - 5507.88] P:1714.52 E:0.090973 |  They won seven of the 10 matches that he started christian erickson
[5507.88 - 5512.12] P:1711.52 E:0.089510 |  And that's why they they finished up in 13th in the premier league last season here is
[5512.76 - 5515.88] P:1528.92 E:0.098750 |  Ronaldo now rinaldo gets it back gives it to malacia
[5515.88 - 5520.60] P:1748.50 E:0.100835 |  But they've got to try and find a way through all of these red and white shirts rashford tries to do that with a burst into the
[5520.60 - 5527.08] P:1767.96 E:0.094703 |  Box he's got support there from erickson erickson plays it across bounces off elanga though at the crucial moment 10 yards out and brentford clear
[5527.96 - 5530.84] P:1618.95 E:0.117608 |  Yes, and that ball almost fell to christiano rinaldo
[5530.84 - 5532.12] P:1719.80 E:0.089433 |  In fact, he did fall to him
[5532.12 - 5537.80] P:1643.82 E:0.093508 |  He just fluffed his lines because it he went to pass it with the side of his foot and he just missed the ball and it skipped past him
[5539.16 - 5546.76] P:1642.01 E:0.097786 |  Again, manches united falter in front of gul as rinaldo hits a shot on the turn, but I think the whistle had already gone in there
[5548.04 - 5551.64] P:1690.67 E:0.109859 |  I think it had it wouldn't have counted but it flew over the top of the the bar
[5551.64 - 5559.40] P:1918.12 E:0.100257 |  So a double change I think for brentford now one of the goalscorers brian and bermos scored the fourth goal running away on the counterattack
[5559.96 - 5561.96] P:2031.73 E:0.092077 |  beat luxe shaw to score it
[5562.76 - 5564.76] P:1957.08 E:0.096941 |  He's uh
[5564.76 - 5566.76] P:1773.90 E:0.106941 |  He is a typical
[5566.76 - 5569.48] P:1829.36 E:0.099010 |  A typical thomas frank brentford player, isn't he?
[5570.20 - 5577.08] P:1880.72 E:0.100466 |  Well the teams follow them and he's going to replace by joan wisah the democratic republic of congo international
[5577.80 - 5582.20] P:1900.38 E:0.104956 |  And matthias jensen who's had a very good game
[5583.88 - 5585.80] P:1941.65 E:0.107883 |  And he is replaced by
[5585.80 - 5587.80] P:1958.95 E:0.085872 |  shandon baptiste
[5587.80 - 5593.16] P:1860.11 E:0.106382 |  Who came on as a substitute at leicester last weekend as well. So baptiste is on
[5595.24 - 5597.16] P:1820.69 E:0.101740 |  And wisah is on
[5597.16 - 5602.20] P:1853.96 E:0.106190 |  And jensen has has really caught the eye today glenn murray. Yeah, he's kept the ball well
[5602.76 - 5608.12] P:1691.04 E:0.101596 |  And I think I think the key thing that is done whenever he's had the opportunity from especially a dead ball
[5608.44 - 5610.44] P:1527.09 E:0.090241 |  He's deliver his into the box of course
[5610.92 - 5613.24] P:1334.30 E:0.096430 |  Cause problems and they've been right on the money for brentford
[5614.60 - 5618.92] P:1673.74 E:0.102580 |  So wisah takes up a forward position brentford for manchester united nil
[5619.64 - 5624.60] P:1631.74 E:0.099739 |  Lines open for 606 08085 9096 93 to talk about this
[5625.56 - 5629.48] P:1575.23 E:0.091779 |  Four nil to brentford the score line of the weekend and just looking at those
[5630.44 - 5632.04] P:1636.24 E:0.088483 |  Those substitutions
[5632.04 - 5633.40] P:1588.68 E:0.080326 |  Wisa for me
[5633.40 - 5635.24] P:1696.30 E:0.087951 |  Could be a problem for manchester united
[5635.24 - 5640.36] P:1859.06 E:0.104110 |  He will want in on the act rashford now. This is hunger rides a couple of challenges. He's in the d
[5641.00 - 5643.56] P:1713.20 E:0.103723 |  Beat a couple of men gives it to rinaldo rinaldo now
[5643.56 - 5647.72] P:1845.20 E:0.103778 |  There's new energy in him a little flick behind the back of his heel gives it to rashford
[5647.96 - 5650.20] P:1627.07 E:0.097984 |  That's headed out to the left hand side malacia
[5650.68 - 5652.92] P:1495.78 E:0.093612 |  Suddenly there rinaldo and rashford looked like
[5653.72 - 5655.00] P:1723.49 E:0.080952 |  Changed men
[5655.00 - 5659.48] P:1579.41 E:0.098218 |  Malacia now on the left hand side back onto his right foot, but he's all left foot
[5659.96 - 5664.12] P:1639.19 E:0.105940 |  And he gives it to finandez and finaldes curls it into the back post dallo arriving
[5664.20 - 5666.76] P:1855.18 E:0.095967 |  But henry got there first with his head behind corner
[5667.16 - 5669.96] P:1768.10 E:0.106347 |  Henry's defended really well that back stick on a couple of occasions
[5669.96 - 5674.28] P:1665.78 E:0.099865 |  We watched the langer try and get on the inside of him just a few minutes ago and he bumped him
[5674.60 - 5677.00] P:1631.84 E:0.103827 |  Perfect defending and again dallo's got the run on him
[5677.16 - 5681.88] P:1694.12 E:0.089412 |  But he stands his ground and clears that ball. We've got henry's done a fantastic job 15 minutes to go
[5682.52 - 5684.52] P:1673.88 E:0.063221 |  four nil to brentford
[5684.76 - 5688.92] P:1693.16 E:0.106070 |  And manchester united's christian ericsson takes this to the near post comp beat nore guard
[5689.40 - 5693.32] P:1757.13 E:0.098556 |  Is able to head it away and wisser is chasing it and elanga is
[5693.88 - 5698.36] P:1685.23 E:0.098567 |  Has got there first, but they're tangling the two of them and he's been fouled by wisser and it's a free kick
[5698.76 - 5700.92] P:1685.37 E:0.100988 |  To manchester united he was playing for it
[5702.20 - 5704.44] P:1632.65 E:0.102502 |  But it's a free kick to manchester united
[5705.40 - 5707.40] P:1729.49 E:0.078863 |  but uh
[5707.88 - 5713.80] P:1611.19 E:0.099426 |  It just feels like it's a matter of just seeing the time down now for brentman brentford. Who would who would have thought that?
[5715.48 - 5716.68] P:1579.27 E:0.074920 |  molasia
[5716.68 - 5719.80] P:1579.35 E:0.096961 |  Just moving across wisser and playing it to the left hand side to
[5720.52 - 5722.52] P:1654.20 E:0.057162 |  to ericsson
[5722.52 - 5727.48] P:1654.55 E:0.104687 |  And then molasia left for the ball high into the box rya up high challenged by
[5727.88 - 5730.92] P:1656.02 E:0.095983 |  Fernandez the two of those a little bump between the two of them, but maya
[5731.32 - 5734.12] P:1702.46 E:0.099543 |  David rya caught it easily. I mean Fernandez gets
[5735.64 - 5742.60] P:1594.76 E:0.105456 |  A warranted knee into his into his leg there because he has no chance of getting that ball. He went in just to
[5743.56 - 5747.64] P:1613.48 E:0.100729 |  Upset rya. I think the the odds probably were more like 80 rya
[5748.36 - 5755.48] P:1488.15 E:0.091866 |  20% Fernandez then it was it was a needless jumping and the manchester united number eight seems to have hurt himself a little bit there
[5755.56 - 5757.56] P:1498.90 E:0.059207 |  Yeah, I think he's all right
[5757.88 - 5759.24] P:1729.87 E:0.087967 |  So brentford's ball
[5759.24 - 5761.48] P:1776.92 E:0.103376 |  So four nil to brentford if you weren't listening earlier
[5761.96 - 5765.88] P:1697.19 E:0.092673 |  So this is equaling brentford's biggest win against manchester united
[5765.88 - 5769.40] P:1751.53 E:0.099234 |  It's going to be their first win against united since before the second world war
[5769.80 - 5773.80] P:1808.36 E:0.091125 |  It's going to be seven consecutive league away defeats in a role
[5774.36 - 5778.28] P:1748.14 E:0.094070 |  For for manchester united. That's not happened since 1936
[5778.68 - 5784.28] P:1739.58 E:0.099267 |  Eric ten hargs going to be the first manchester united manager to lose his first two matches since 1921
[5784.68 - 5787.24] P:1795.50 E:0.100548 |  And he'll be the first manchester united manager to lose his
[5787.96 - 5791.00] P:1743.15 E:0.091249 |  First away match since sat alex fergerson
[5792.36 - 5796.84] P:1630.42 E:0.107227 |  So at least he's in good company there. That's one positive stat there. You've just finished with john. Yes
[5797.80 - 5801.96] P:1649.89 E:0.102372 |  Throw in full manchester united halfway inside their own half
[5803.00 - 5807.08] P:1620.37 E:0.100157 |  Malacia to take this the brentford fans are getting excited about it on the far side
[5807.08 - 5811.00] P:1521.20 E:0.102481 |  I think they're just excited generally and then there's a foul by mcdomenay
[5811.96 - 5815.88] P:1814.89 E:0.104597 |  mcdomenay who many felt might have been shown a red card last week
[5816.04 - 5818.04] P:1749.80 E:0.098519 |  This is only a free kick and rightly so
[5818.52 - 5822.20] P:1852.10 E:0.100702 |  But it's a free kick the brentford and that's relieved the pressure. They've been under for
[5822.92 - 5829.80] P:1599.16 E:0.097684 |  For a few minutes or so, but I mean I say pressure. It's not been intense pressure because I think everyone here everyone assembled
[5830.52 - 5838.04] P:1656.29 E:0.097515 |  Inside the the g-tech community stadium knows what the outcome of this match is going to be three points to brentford non to manchester united
[5838.60 - 5841.08] P:1551.96 E:0.095534 |  I feel as though that has been thomas franc's tactics
[5841.56 - 5847.24] P:1481.67 E:0.104259 |  I think taken into consideration the heat of the days wanted his place to sit in and hit manchester united on the counterattack
[5847.24 - 5851.80] P:1572.17 E:0.099023 |  And that shows through the possession sats. I mean the away side manchester united who were four nil down
[5852.20 - 5854.20] P:1516.25 E:0.074289 |  Have 69 percent of possession
[5855.24 - 5857.24] P:1627.56 E:0.088712 |  free kick then that
[5857.96 - 5862.12] P:1630.58 E:0.095070 |  Yanelt is going to take I think there's two of them over there, but it is yanelt
[5862.52 - 5865.96] P:1698.60 E:0.098129 |  Who strikes it and he's missed it that all together and he's given it to rashford
[5865.96 - 5871.00] P:1745.14 E:0.094909 |  He was very nearly away on the counterattack until he was tripped by shandon batteast
[5871.72 - 5878.12] P:1604.23 E:0.096596 |  Who might be a little fortunate not to get a yellow card for that because rashford was away, but it's a free kick to manchester united
[5878.52 - 5883.00] P:1513.39 E:0.093858 |  But again from brentford game management that is that that as far as brentford are concerned
[5883.64 - 5886.68] P:1575.07 E:0.096675 |  Shandon batteast that is that is a good professional foul
[5886.92 - 5892.60] P:1656.24 E:0.094380 |  He stopped the attack and any opportunity that rashford might be able to open up his legs
[5896.52 - 5901.00] P:1664.38 E:0.099322 |  Four nil then and united take this free kick across that back line
[5901.96 - 5908.60] P:1704.94 E:0.100813 |  Oh eight oh eight five nine oh nine six nine three is the number to talk about this or any of the matches that you're at

[5926.52 - 5931.00] P:1966.86 E:0.098143 |  Their fourth and fifth changes and it's aron hickey who is
[5932.04 - 5934.44] P:1958.64 E:0.103209 |  Going to be the first man to come off
[5937.16 - 5943.00] P:1845.16 E:0.111024 |  And what a superb sign in that young man's being plucked from atlanta young scotsman come back to the uk

[5947.64 - 5953.64] P:1776.67 E:0.109533 |  Bologna actually it was very close together actually we were we were there last season bologna and atlanta
[5954.04 - 5958.44] P:1884.31 E:0.106464 |  But here he comes off the field very quietly gone about his business very impressive
[5961.72 - 5964.68] P:1813.98 E:0.108864 |  So he's on and mads speck sorenson
[5965.48 - 5967.48] P:1814.57 E:0.089552 |  Comes on so i guess
[5967.56 - 5970.60] P:1640.72 E:0.103564 |  roast level maybe move out to the right hand side of the defense
[5971.88 - 5973.48] P:1884.12 E:0.101029 |  and
[5973.48 - 5975.48] P:1896.80 E:0.110326 |  The other change sees frank onyeka
[5976.20 - 5979.40] P:1913.95 E:0.104766 |  Coming onto the field the nigerian international
[5980.04 - 5981.56] P:1948.18 E:0.082553 |  midfield at
[5981.56 - 5987.40] P:1785.45 E:0.099083 |  The number 15 and i think that's for christian norgad who's just walking behind the back of the goal and he's blending in
[5988.20 - 5990.76] P:1735.23 E:0.102691 |  To all the brentford shirt in the stand as he would
[5991.48 - 5997.48] P:1734.96 E:0.105818 |  Yes, i just wish as the uh long throw is taken for brentford and it comes out for the shot that is flashed in
[5999.24 - 6004.52] P:1874.54 E:0.104691 |  From henry from 25 yards through a crowd of players david to here to his right was able to make a
[6004.92 - 6007.88] P:1642.18 E:0.098847 |  A decent save actually got a good side of it. It wasn't too wide of him
[6008.36 - 6011.72] P:1689.00 E:0.110311 |  Yeah, it was a good save. It was a really good strike by henry. He caught on his left foot
[6011.72 - 6014.28] P:1769.30 E:0.095505 |  It fell nicely for him, but do you know what struck me there?
[6014.84 - 6018.68] P:1859.63 E:0.099941 |  Was his reaction as soon as he hit that ball his first thought was next action
[6018.84 - 6024.28] P:1833.65 E:0.095587 |  I need to get back into position and he did a 70 yard sprints from the right hand side of the field
[6024.76 - 6029.88] P:1931.09 E:0.100841 |  Back to his left back position. Yeah, that speaks volumes tells you all you need to know about

[6037.48 - 6040.36] P:1714.40 E:0.104975 |  That's a that's a great start after the way that they finished last season
[6040.76 - 6045.08] P:1775.27 E:0.100135 |  They were in a bit of trouble weren't they at one stage mcdomonate gives it to the left and molasia
[6045.24 - 6050.12] P:1862.71 E:0.100126 |  Now rashford's ball across the stretch back sorensen and then it's turned across the face of gold by ericsson
[6050.36 - 6052.36] P:1766.25 E:0.083003 |  I thought he'd hooked it in
[6052.36 - 6053.64] P:1819.72 E:0.095693 |  But he hooked it wide
[6053.64 - 6057.40] P:1593.35 E:0.104231 |  I did it just popped up nicely for ericsson didn't it was a little bit behind him
[6057.40 - 6061.08] P:1628.60 E:0.091338 |  He had to swing that left foot he got deflected the ball in from
[6061.88 - 6065.24] P:1723.80 E:0.098796 |  Rashford and he swung his left foot on the volley back across the goal
[6065.56 - 6069.88] P:1696.80 E:0.098643 |  And he just hooked it a little bit too wide as we just watch it in our monitor just sale
[6070.76 - 6074.92] P:1653.08 E:0.099413 |  Actually what ends up a couple of foot we had through the post but for a second there
[6075.00 - 6077.24] P:1588.20 E:0.088551 |  I was expecting the back of the net to bulge
[6078.36 - 6080.36] P:1611.21 E:0.099591 |  less than 10 minutes to go
[6080.92 - 6084.68] P:1735.49 E:0.087158 |  brentford full majesty united nil and uh

[6093.56 - 6097.80] P:1684.04 E:0.088855 |  Yep, that will be the final change van der beek, but I mean the game's long gone
[6097.88 - 6099.80] P:1471.90 E:0.101485 |  I bet he's delighted to be coming for the last night
[6099.80 - 6106.52] P:1814.88 E:0.107890 |  Oh, there's a foul by mcdomonate and now wish I placed it across who's going to play in toni mcdomonate could be in trouble here
[6107.16 - 6109.16] P:1868.09 E:0.092826 |  It's going to be a yellow card
[6109.16 - 6111.16] P:1923.34 E:0.099072 |  for the uh for the foul
[6112.20 - 6114.12] P:1849.53 E:0.075009 |  on onyeka
[6114.12 - 6117.80] P:1512.95 E:0.110142 |  Who I mean I think it is I think it is a yellow but brentford were away there
[6117.80 - 6120.36] P:1768.57 E:0.100580 |  But it was in the middle of the half he had options though
[6120.92 - 6122.92] P:1709.00 E:0.093792 |  But a yellow card it is from mcdomonate
[6123.32 - 6125.32] P:1707.66 E:0.083315 |  It was the same problems again
[6125.32 - 6127.32] P:1607.26 E:0.112463 |  The deep line midfield they're getting rolled the ball
[6127.64 - 6130.68] P:1630.68 E:0.093624 |  Trying to turn trying to play the ball around the corner getting closed down
[6131.08 - 6136.36] P:1557.91 E:0.095676 |  brentford robbing possession and immediately they're in at majesty united's back two or three. I mean
[6137.32 - 6140.44] P:1591.47 E:0.103611 |  When are this group? I mean they're such talented footballers
[6140.44 - 6144.44] P:1432.89 E:0.099454 |  When are they going to realize and stop making the same mistakes over and over again?
[6144.68 - 6146.68] P:1737.53 E:0.097395 |  It doesn't take eric ten hag
[6147.00 - 6152.20] P:1618.18 E:0.092889 |  As the manager of the ball to make them realize they know they're making the same mistakes over and over again at the moment
[6153.08 - 6155.56] P:1469.15 E:0.098400 |  That's it clen. You're absolutely right that you know the
[6156.36 - 6159.88] P:1599.43 E:0.100629 |  You look at the individual talent that there is on this page
[6160.76 - 6166.68] P:1539.93 E:0.103480 |  And you think it's unmatched from the brentford half. Yeah completely unmatched the talent in the majesty united squad
[6167.16 - 6172.04] P:1485.07 E:0.086492 |  Is second to none and you do think what is it with them that
[6173.48 - 6179.64] P:1649.75 E:0.098092 |  That none of the you know eric ten hag is at two matches so far all of the managers who've been in that position
[6180.60 - 6185.40] P:1659.90 E:0.104030 |  You know they've lost they've lost their jobs because they haven't been able to make it work
[6186.04 - 6192.76] P:1603.99 E:0.096372 |  Yeah to possibly motivate this group. I think it's I think we've got to stop looking at the majesty united managers because
[6193.72 - 6198.52] P:1526.97 E:0.099472 |  It's the same story regardless of the manager. So you've got to start looking at the players
[6200.92 - 6205.56] P:1506.53 E:0.104221 |  Freak it on. Jaqa has is still receiving treatment actually. I think he sort of rolled his ankle, didn't he?
[6205.64 - 6207.64] P:1608.57 E:0.095621 |  So mcdomony put in the challenge
[6208.12 - 6211.72] P:1573.79 E:0.105740 |  And his ankle buckled a little and he's on his feet. I mean he's a
[6212.92 - 6214.92] P:1739.27 E:0.117912 |  He's a formidable figure, isn't he?
[6215.88 - 6217.96] P:1697.86 E:0.108755 |  And I think there's yellow cut is that finandez?
[6218.52 - 6224.44] P:1577.76 E:0.100552 |  Is it something that's been said? I think I think he's been mourning just a little bit too much as as he quite often does
[6226.12 - 6229.80] P:1621.20 E:0.103261 |  So yellow card for finandez that's gone down. I think that's that's put the seal on it
[6229.80 - 6233.72] P:1626.13 E:0.095232 |  Hasn't it for the brentford supporters after the uh after the way that he's been

[6246.76 - 6252.20] P:1680.11 E:0.102821 |  Brentford are still walking set pieces from the training ground. They're still thinking they're still being calm in the moment
[6252.20 - 6256.52] P:1671.70 E:0.091631 |  They're they're going through the process is what they know to do. Yeah
[6258.12 - 6263.32] P:1692.00 E:0.102961 |  Brentford leading four nil six oh six on the way with robbie savage and chris suiting to talk about this
[6264.36 - 6271.40] P:1605.03 E:0.094845 |  Another awful day from anchester united, but what a day for brentford. They'll be wanting brentford fans on to celebrate this
[6272.28 - 6276.04] P:1581.13 E:0.094755 |  Corner then from the right hand side lots of movement again
[6276.04 - 6283.00] P:1740.02 E:0.096427 |  But the this time it's headed away by ronaldo. Henry miss hits a shot into the penalty area still brentford attack
[6283.48 - 6288.20] P:1743.49 E:0.109362 |  And oh wonderful for work and the shot from the angle from janelle is carried away in behind

[6293.64 - 6298.44] P:1757.95 E:0.101754 |  They picked this ball up and he's just skipped past a couple of Manchester united players
[6299.16 - 6302.60] P:1595.98 E:0.105215 |  One go sliding past and then another checks backing onto his left foot and he
[6303.00 - 6308.52] P:1762.70 E:0.106233 |  Unleases a shot and i think he corner's taken quickly and the shot comes in from the edge of the penalty area from wissa
[6308.68 - 6310.60] P:1692.76 E:0.101848 |  De here got down well and carried it away
[6310.60 - 6314.92] P:1813.67 E:0.097056 |  It was cleared away in comes the next bolt of an ear post but that's scooped up by de here
[6315.00 - 6319.48] P:1662.80 E:0.098947 |  Yes, and it was the here who made the first save and then two more saves after that and
[6320.12 - 6324.52] P:1635.42 E:0.107140 |  All of a sudden he's busy and we say manches not you on the attack now. Yeah booze for christian ericsson

[6336.12 - 6339.24] P:1774.18 E:0.109370 |  Actually running field from a langer. It was to the edge of the penalty area
[6339.80 - 6344.92] P:1781.40 E:0.099039 |  Ronaldo with the shot, but it was curled straight into the chest of goalkeeper raya
[6345.16 - 6349.24] P:1574.39 E:0.107316 |  Yes, and as a langer was just making his way along that brentford eight in yaw box
[6350.12 - 6355.16] P:1569.97 E:0.099198 |  Fernandez almost tried to take the ball off him. I think he might have kicked the young man trying to shoot with goal
[6355.48 - 6357.48] P:1713.16 E:0.070478 |  One of those days glenn
[6358.68 - 6362.04] P:1694.00 E:0.102941 |  The problem from anxious united is that they've had far too many

[6388.28 - 6393.40] P:1789.09 E:0.089530 |  Fernandez ball in took a deflection stretch and clearance away from yansen
[6394.52 - 6399.48] P:1674.58 E:0.101404 |  Bruno Fernandez again on the right hand side long shadows now being cast by that hot sun
[6400.20 - 6402.52] P:1568.43 E:0.102796 |  Diego dallo into the penalty area
[6403.40 - 6407.88] P:1770.26 E:0.095410 |  Then he read that all afternoon and cleared it out of play near the halfway line
[6407.96 - 6411.72] P:1711.74 E:0.098780 |  So four nil it is and we'll see van der beek coming on now
[6413.16 - 6415.16] P:1643.94 E:0.093025 |  And it's going to be
[6418.04 - 6420.04] P:1719.32 E:0.128717 |  Christina ericsson is off
[6420.92 - 6422.92] P:1752.04 E:0.106929 |  And they're going to wave him goodbye
[6423.00 - 6425.56] P:1831.03 E:0.115789 |  Christina ericsson. They loved it when he was here last season
[6426.44 - 6428.44] P:1790.52 E:0.112398 |  But they were unhappy that he didn't stay
[6431.48 - 6434.76] P:1674.68 E:0.107118 |  And therefore that's why some brentford fans have budin
[6434.76 - 6438.36] P:1629.74 E:0.100283 |  But you can hear plenty of them here are applauding them as well in the stands too
[6438.36 - 6439.16] P:1453.02 E:0.106385 |  I should make that point
[6439.16 - 6442.52] P:1538.67 E:0.105937 |  I can actually see one or two of them having to go one another over that issue there because
[6442.84 - 6446.84] P:1480.15 E:0.103496 |  Well, I know it has been debated amongst brentford fans this week. Yeah, it has yeah
[6446.84 - 6450.92] P:1441.27 E:0.094386 |  And I for one are definitely on the ones that he needed to be applauded not
[6451.48 - 6453.40] P:1499.67 E:0.096496 |  Definitely not for the way he's played this afternoon
[6453.40 - 6457.32] P:1532.79 E:0.094818 |  But just because of what he done to this football club because I think at one point last season
[6457.72 - 6461.24] P:1509.57 E:0.101337 |  brentford looked like they could be possibly going to get into that tangle of going down but
[6461.96 - 6463.96] P:1686.87 E:0.091554 |  Like I said earlier that that that
[6463.96 - 6469.24] P:1551.15 E:0.105548 |  Partnership between him and tony and the understanding. I really feel fended the relegation fight off
[6469.40 - 6475.64] P:1573.34 E:0.096942 |  Yeah, there were seven wins in their last 11 games really lifted them completely out of danger and ericsson was at the heart of that
[6476.12 - 6481.16] P:1815.66 E:0.101584 |  So three minutes less than three minutes to go brentford four, manchester united nail plus added time
[6481.16 - 6485.08] P:1647.47 E:0.099072 |  There'll be plenty of that as well. Then it'll be six or six. We'll have the live interviews as well
[6485.08 - 6489.96] P:1783.40 E:0.095646 |  Don't don't miss those robbie and chris will be handing to john south all who'll be down talking to
[6490.76 - 6495.32] P:1760.06 E:0.100103 |  Eric ken haag and thomas frank. They'll be very different interviews those two won't they?
[6496.04 - 6498.04] P:1492.35 E:0.100785 |  Well, I think from the
[6498.28 - 6504.92] P:1807.24 E:0.104610 |  Oh poor ball from dallow has set brentford away on a counter attack and that's a foul by rashford coming back
[6506.12 - 6510.84] P:1770.36 E:0.099379 |  Conceding the free kick. I mean he had uh, he had so many options there
[6510.92 - 6512.84] P:1483.44 E:0.085661 |  That's a good foul by rashford by the way
[6512.84 - 6518.20] P:1662.09 E:0.091679 |  Baptiste could have gone through the middle right left with his pass but rashford brought him down yellow color
[6518.28 - 6523.00] P:1655.42 E:0.092006 |  We've we've talked about manchinite a lot in this game, but with two minutes to go rashford did show
[6523.80 - 6526.36] P:1465.72 E:0.108990 |  a little bit of something there coming back and burst
[6527.56 - 6531.16] P:1645.07 E:0.103651 |  Burstens neck to get back there and make a challenge and stop that brentford attack
[6531.48 - 6533.48] P:1828.65 E:0.087210 |  What do you think glenn with rashford?
[6533.72 - 6538.20] P:1624.72 E:0.099843 |  Paris Saint-Germain then in fact you can answer that in a moment because yannelt is going to play this free kick now
[6538.20 - 6540.20] P:1483.30 E:0.065692 |  out to the right hand side
[6540.20 - 6541.40] P:1456.66 E:0.079851 |  and uh
[6541.40 - 6543.40] P:1448.64 E:0.045194 |  whist that
[6543.40 - 6545.40] P:1540.73 E:0.077531 |  to baptiste
[6545.96 - 6547.40] P:1511.68 E:0.066601 |  brentford
[6547.48 - 6551.56] P:1615.04 E:0.106043 |  In possession way over there in that corner on the right and here's the cross which is
[6552.04 - 6556.84] P:1658.04 E:0.097816 |  That's got some adrenaline behind it that's pumped high over the penalty area and into the stand
[6556.92 - 6561.72] P:1557.01 E:0.101411 |  So go kick brentford who lead 4-0. So what do I think about the possibility of
[6561.96 - 6565.08] P:1675.19 E:0.096790 |  Mark's rashford leave manchist united? Well, yeah, would that be good for
[6565.80 - 6567.80] P:1483.21 E:0.103399 |  First of all, would that be good for the individual?
[6568.20 - 6569.56] P:1531.10 E:0.059052 |  Yes
[6569.56 - 6570.60] P:1462.78 E:0.104957 |  Yes, indeed
[6570.60 - 6574.52] P:1558.27 E:0.104282 |  I mean you've got I think you've got to accept that manch that rashford's a manchester boy
[6575.00 - 6577.96] P:1390.54 E:0.102206 |  Think he's a manchester united fan. So there's there's that side of it
[6577.96 - 6583.16] P:1384.39 E:0.103921 |  But I think when you look at it you only get a certain number of years playing this this beautiful game that we watch
[6583.56 - 6585.08] P:1502.04 E:0.102178 |  Week in week out
[6585.08 - 6589.80] P:1581.62 E:0.104122 |  And he wants to win things because he is such an exceptional talent and and is he going to win things?
[6590.60 - 6592.60] P:1385.54 E:0.098525 |  Looking at this afternoon's viewing
[6593.08 - 6594.68] P:1659.29 E:0.086585 |  Not quickly is not
[6594.68 - 6597.00] P:1645.27 E:0.101413 |  And then when we look at it from a manchester united point of view
[6598.12 - 6599.72] P:1510.05 E:0.087349 |  I think he's sort of the
[6599.72 - 6603.56] P:1581.46 E:0.105025 |  The jewel in the crown almost even though he hasn't produced it over the last year or so
[6603.96 - 6608.28] P:1401.50 E:0.102908 |  I still think he's one of the better ones at manchester united and the potential is still clearly there
[6608.28 - 6610.84] P:1260.00 E:0.095850 |  So from a club perspective, they will be desperate to keep him
[6611.72 - 6615.00] P:1746.20 E:0.106007 |  So that's marcus rashford glenn murray on marcus rashford
[6615.80 - 6621.24] P:1772.10 E:0.105215 |  One premier league striker on another four minutes of added time the ball is hoisted up in our direction
[6621.32 - 6627.88] P:1628.05 E:0.089897 |  Won't actually go off the field ben me is now putting it into the stands just down where we're left almost got a touch there glenn
[6628.84 - 6631.88] P:1662.63 E:0.105270 |  Four nil brentford lead were in added time four minutes of added time
[6632.04 - 6635.40] P:1557.55 E:0.100157 |  Well, I don't think we'll forget this afternoon in a hurry brentford fans certainly warned
[6636.44 - 6639.32] P:1697.89 E:0.098874 |  First first time you and I have done a commentary together
[6640.04 - 6643.00] P:1573.11 E:0.109663 |  So that is I think that could be a first for five lives by the way
[6643.08 - 6645.88] P:1673.41 E:0.097386 |  rinaldo thinks about a shot from 30 yards
[6645.96 - 6649.80] P:1646.56 E:0.099638 |  But then gives it to mcdominé and mcdominé plays it behind molasia
[6650.28 - 6652.44] P:1765.55 E:0.114160 |  And the ball rolls out of play for a throwing
[6653.16 - 6655.24] P:1687.39 E:0.109647 |  And that again a yet another example of
[6655.80 - 6663.72] P:1562.26 E:0.096498 |  Well that sums it up for manchester united today. I think I think plays is it's quite it's a nice term that john because he drilled that behind him didn't he
[6664.12 - 6666.12] P:1870.99 E:0.072770 |  Yeah, he did
[6666.20 - 6671.48] P:1590.04 E:0.110358 |  Yeah, I did I did hear chappers chatting earlier on the show and he said we have the brothers the murray brothers
[6671.56 - 6673.88] P:1464.99 E:0.097227 |  I mean, I think it's more a father and son act
[6674.68 - 6677.32] P:1722.84 E:0.089897 |  Yeah, that's that's a sad turn of events
[6678.36 - 6680.36] P:1404.21 E:0.103600 |  And not careful it might not be happening again
[6681.08 - 6685.32] P:1644.73 E:0.094226 |  I was thinking more of the fact that it was a cumbrian nor thumb brian
[6686.60 - 6687.72] P:1695.67 E:0.072422 |  A
[6687.72 - 6690.60] P:1641.88 E:0.111890 |  Combination you and me. I'm not sure we've had I'm not sure we've had one of those before
[6691.72 - 6694.60] P:1476.98 E:0.113488 |  In a commentary team on five lives, but I'm not sure the bbc have
[6695.96 - 6699.16] P:1627.98 E:0.094167 |  Well, let's let's not get too political after the week that we've had
[6699.64 - 6701.88] P:1536.01 E:0.101137 |  Here's van der beek it bounces off into
[6702.52 - 6705.40] P:1508.37 E:0.097642 |  Jan Elk and Jan Elk through over the halfway line
[6705.80 - 6710.20] P:1574.67 E:0.094566 |  Baptiste back to Jan Elk, but it's all a time for the brenford supporters surprised
[6710.84 - 6712.52] P:1617.22 E:0.084535 |  Some of them actually are
[6712.52 - 6717.24] P:1738.62 E:0.103534 |  Leaving early here. You'd think they'd want to be a partner. I mean not many just one or two
[6717.32 - 6721.24] P:1610.83 E:0.099528 |  I should say but you think they'd want to be part of hey jude after this inside this ground
[6721.40 - 6727.16] P:1500.54 E:0.102480 |  We did chat about that earlier, didn't we john and I remember the the the atmosphere against arson last year the opening game and the
[6727.24 - 6731.16] P:1392.63 E:0.098641 |  Liverpool game here and I was really blown away by the atmosphere but today it's
[6731.80 - 6734.68] P:1498.73 E:0.105859 |  I can't say it's been flat, but it's maybe been a little bit disappointing
[6735.00 - 6737.00] P:1629.72 E:0.102095 |  Well, maybe it's been too easy
[6737.72 - 6739.72] P:1642.87 E:0.083599 |  for brenford. Well that that is a point
[6739.72 - 6741.00] P:1482.26 E:0.083025 |  uh
[6741.00 - 6745.32] P:1703.42 E:0.106652 |  But wait for wait for hey jude after the match and thomas frank will take his players around
[6745.56 - 6751.32] P:1535.67 E:0.099936 |  You know, this is to be celebrated this whatever the state of manchester united to for brenford from where they were
[6751.72 - 6753.72] P:1517.19 E:0.099379 |  You know remember it's not too long ago
[6754.92 - 6757.56] P:1674.03 E:0.101778 |  That they spent a couple of seasons in the fourth tier
[6758.68 - 6761.48] P:1693.57 E:0.103068 |  And uh, you know had to make bookard collections
[6762.20 - 6764.20] P:1600.89 E:0.076731 |  to keep the club going
[6764.28 - 6768.52] P:1662.82 E:0.102978 |  Now look at them now. It just shows what a club ran properly can achieve though, doesn't it?
[6770.28 - 6771.88] P:1876.84 E:0.094066 |  Certainly does
[6771.88 - 6773.88] P:1744.07 E:0.104810 |  And here is goalkeeper raya
[6774.76 - 6781.00] P:1738.56 E:0.099916 |  Passing the ball out there henry brenford next weekend by the way one of the saturday three o'clock seal here on five live
[6781.56 - 6786.12] P:1749.83 E:0.098566 |  They are not too far away at fulham for west london darby fulham brenford
[6787.32 - 6788.60] P:1631.36 E:0.089584 |  so
[6788.68 - 6790.68] P:1722.54 E:0.095415 |  Brentford in possession with ben me
[6790.76 - 6795.32] P:1635.91 E:0.107587 |  And oh bruno finandez now is that a second yellow card was he booked earlier?
[6795.40 - 6797.88] P:1483.59 E:0.103633 |  I thought he was booked earlier john on the edge of the box
[6798.12 - 6804.28] P:1456.33 E:0.104300 |  He clearly wasn't so that is a yellow card for finandez, you know, he's just a little we thought he was didn't we early ron on the edge of the box
[6804.28 - 6806.68] P:1544.14 E:0.100298 |  We weren't a hundred percent sure so that confirms it
[6807.32 - 6809.32] P:1547.24 E:0.110364 |  So i'm sure stewart atwell didn't get that wrong
[6813.16 - 6815.16] P:1902.19 E:0.110444 |  So yellow card for finandez
[6815.64 - 6820.76] P:1774.79 E:0.105869 |  Just a minute or so to play before brenford can celebrate this this great win for them
[6821.48 - 6825.16] P:1779.18 E:0.098419 |  raya clears the ball away downfield david de here's got the ball in his hands
[6825.48 - 6832.52] P:1691.48 E:0.101184 |  If you weren't listening earlier david de here caught out badly a really poor mistake from him to concede the opening goal to de silber
[6833.16 - 6837.64] P:1774.20 E:0.101756 |  matthews jensen scored the second after christian erickson of all people was caught in possession
[6838.04 - 6844.68] P:1782.95 E:0.103668 |  The third came from a corner ben mees first goal for brenford and then brennan bermos scored on the breakaway to make it four
[6844.76 - 6847.64] P:1935.70 E:0.100992 |  Nail that was four nil inside 35 minutes
[6847.96 - 6854.12] P:1835.87 E:0.104139 |  That's the way that the scorers remained and brenford have won a free kick battees won a free kick after inside his own half
[6854.44 - 6855.56] P:1659.68 E:0.107570 |  And there it is
[6855.56 - 6864.92] P:1930.38 E:0.104147 |  There is the final whistle here at brenford's community stadium to herald a famous victory that equalled their record victory against
[6865.00 - 6871.24] P:1848.89 E:0.103400 |  Manchester united brenford's first win against Manchester united since before the second world war
[6872.04 - 6875.88] P:1818.65 E:0.109361 |  But the history for Manchester united is all bleak
[6876.52 - 6878.12] P:1740.94 E:0.096314 |  eric ten haag
[6878.12 - 6879.40] P:1896.72 E:0.103898 |  becomes the first
[6879.40 - 6881.40] P:1838.10 E:0.105245 |  Manchester united manager since
[6882.04 - 6883.40] P:1650.81 E:0.091919 |  1921
[6883.40 - 6886.44] P:1837.25 E:0.102668 |  To lose his first two matches in charge
[6887.24 - 6892.44] P:1792.96 E:0.099139 |  And united under his stewardship are left with no points from two matches
[6892.92 - 6898.92] P:1799.09 E:0.100081 |  Against breighton and brenford that is a horrible start for the new manager glenn murray
[6899.88 - 6906.44] P:1717.84 E:0.115425 |  Yeah, I mean starts don't get any worse than that as i'm just witnessing without the walk off and he doesn't look very happy at all
[6906.52 - 6911.16] P:1713.30 E:0.111020 |  He's having a little bit of words with I think it was steve mclaren as he walks off
[6911.16 - 6913.72] P:1681.62 E:0.102044 |  I mean it's just it does I think from the positive
[6913.80 - 6918.92] P:1717.15 E:0.111060 |  But he's just walked right past eric ten haag by the way he didn't shake his hand and eric ten haag also unmoved
[6919.00 - 6922.84] P:1763.54 E:0.113356 |  They didn't acknowledge each other but I mean I think I think from a Manchester united point of view
[6923.08 - 6928.12] P:1714.31 E:0.113149 |  It doesn't get any worse jump. What was that exchange with steve mclaren glenn? I didn't see that
[6928.36 - 6929.72] P:1611.11 E:0.117146 |  No, I missed it to be honest
[6929.72 - 6934.76] P:1726.42 E:0.111898 |  But every one of them spoken to steve mclaren as they walked off and not one player has even looked at eric ten haag
[6935.16 - 6938.92] P:1735.40 E:0.117865 |  Mind you if I put a performance in like that. I might not look at my manager either
[6941.08 - 6943.08] P:2029.16 E:0.108077 |  Wretched day for Manchester united
[6944.12 - 6947.00] P:1946.31 E:0.107981 |  They've been beaten four nil by brenford
[6947.64 - 6953.56] P:1873.64 E:0.111619 |  But a great day for thomas frank and his team and they are going to enjoy this moment in the sunshine here
