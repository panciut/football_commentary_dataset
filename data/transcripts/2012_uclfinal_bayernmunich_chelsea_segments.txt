[0.00 - 7.00] P:1656.16 E:0.039747 |  It is an absolutely fantastic stadium. It's one of the very best in the world.
[7.00 - 10.00] P:1405.77 E:0.074661 |  They still, the Mosaic away to our right, say,
[10.00 - 17.00] P:1333.71 E:0.065996 |  Unzara Stadeon, Unzara Pokal, our city, our stadium, our team.
[17.00 - 21.00] P:1459.17 E:0.065064 |  But would it be from Bayern Munich's point of view, our cup at the end of the night?
[21.00 - 23.00] P:1306.06 E:0.064087 |  That's all to be unveiled here.
[23.00 - 28.00] P:1372.22 E:0.052851 |  Ten and a half weeks ago, this couldn't have happened for Chelsea, really.
[28.00 - 32.00] P:1606.78 E:0.063615 |  Roberto Di Matteo took charge of his first game ten and a half weeks ago.
[32.00 - 35.00] P:1361.81 E:0.052859 |  An FA Cup replay at Birmingham.
[35.00 - 37.00] P:1377.67 E:0.061832 |  They had been beaten three-one at Napoli,
[37.00 - 43.00] P:1407.92 E:0.063061 |  and still, of course, had the second leg at Stanford Bridge to come in the Champions League.
[43.00 - 50.00] P:1338.63 E:0.070411 |  This is his team tonight, and there are four players in the side who began in Moscow four years ago.
[50.00 - 56.00] P:1312.28 E:0.065013 |  Goalkeeper check, the back four, Basingwer, Luis, Cahill and Ashley Cole.
[56.00 - 60.00] P:1367.34 E:0.063121 |  And then, Miquel and Lampard playing in front of the back four.
[60.00 - 66.00] P:1410.49 E:0.069142 |  Kalu Matta and 22-year-old Ryan Bertrand making his Champions League debut.
[66.00 - 74.00] P:1400.66 E:0.059713 |  And then, for me, the man who could make all the difference tonight if he's on fire, Didier Dragbo.
[74.00 - 81.00] P:1424.90 E:0.058773 |  Bayern Munich with seven of the German team, Neueringol, he's one of them, of course.
[81.00 - 88.00] P:1497.27 E:0.051958 |  Martin Lamm, Boateng, Timershuk, who's played over a hundred times for Ukraine and Contento.
[88.00 - 95.00] P:1520.57 E:0.048959 |  Then, Schweinsteiger and Kruse, Robin, Muller, Rieberi and Gomez.
[95.00 - 104.00] P:1348.96 E:0.048602 |  You just wonder whether Tony Kruse might be shackled in the role that he's been given tonight.
[104.00 - 110.00] P:1362.67 E:0.062654 |  We've been paying tribute to Muller before the game, but Muller's been out of sorts for most of this season,
[110.00 - 114.00] P:1427.27 E:0.068947 |  and it's been Kruse in behind Gomez who's been very, very effective.
[114.00 - 121.00] P:1272.38 E:0.063849 |  But tonight, because of the absence of Gustavo, Kruse has to play a more withdrawn role.
[121.00 - 129.00] P:1382.37 E:0.060722 |  Chelsea in the first half will play from left to right, from the outside of this arena.
[129.00 - 134.00] P:1573.07 E:0.054173 |  It looks a little bit like a Steven Spielberg created spaceship.
[134.00 - 141.00] P:1577.43 E:0.067872 |  So for Chelsea, four years on, would it be close encounter of the second time, or can they go all the way?
[141.00 - 147.00] P:1842.82 E:0.050173 |  It's back with Czech for the first time, and Czech clears high into the night,
[147.00 - 152.00] P:1367.76 E:0.057527 |  and the ball is on the halfway line, and it breaks back into the Bayern Munich back four,
[152.00 - 155.00] P:1506.84 E:0.057972 |  and Neuer has his first touch, fed by Timershuk.
[155.00 - 160.00] P:1493.72 E:0.060649 |  Neuer's driven ball towards Gomez, Luis against Gomez for the first time.
[160.00 - 167.00] P:1543.30 E:0.064380 |  Chelsea have possession, and the whistle's gone from the Portuguese referee, who is Pedro Proenza,
[167.00 - 169.00] P:1378.57 E:0.052440 |  and Mark, he's given Bayern an early free kick.
[169.00 - 174.00] P:1396.21 E:0.052521 |  Yeah, it was a free kick, Matt, but see how quickly Bayern players wanted to surround the referee.
[174.00 - 180.00] P:1166.62 E:0.059844 |  I think they're hoping for an early yellow card, a little bit naughty.
[180.00 - 186.00] P:1366.31 E:0.071355 |  Well, the last time I was in this stadium, we were lower down, watching Manchester City get taken apart
[186.00 - 190.00] P:1427.97 E:0.057936 |  in the first half in the Champions League match.
[190.00 - 197.00] P:1326.06 E:0.060656 |  Bayern Munich have this early free kick with Iron Robin, the former Chelsea player settling on the ball.
[197.00 - 201.00] P:1532.49 E:0.057593 |  Schweinsteiger bobbing around on the edge of the penalty area.
[201.00 - 207.00] P:1395.02 E:0.050807 |  Chelsea getting just about everybody back, and Robin prepares himself.
[207.00 - 212.00] P:1465.25 E:0.061526 |  Robin delivers the free kick, and it's headed away easily by Bersingwer of Chelsea.
[212.00 - 219.00] P:1274.22 E:0.062795 |  Back come Bayern for the first time, it's Rieberi on the near side, cuts in and then plays a good ball into the centre circle,
[219.00 - 223.00] P:1476.96 E:0.060220 |  and Timershuk now finds his captain, La, over on the right.
[223.00 - 229.00] P:1679.44 E:0.055750 |  Bayern getting early possession here with Boateng, the former Manchester City man, on to Timershuk.
[229.00 - 234.00] P:1462.50 E:0.058659 |  Bayern settling quickly here, and the ball is played by Rieberi to Robin for the first time.
[234.00 - 236.00] P:1623.85 E:0.065481 |  He's double marked immediately, Robin.
[236.00 - 240.00] P:1478.25 E:0.055050 |  Robin played the ball into the penalty area, at Chelsea looking to clear,
[240.00 - 245.00] P:1390.35 E:0.065815 |  and that was a handball by Kruse, and the referee shows him a yellow card.
[245.00 - 251.00] P:1710.43 E:0.068130 |  Schweinsteiger, yellow card, not Kruse. Schweinsteiger deliberate yellow card.
[251.00 - 255.00] P:1427.67 E:0.035460 |  Yeah, absolutely right. Great for Chelsea.
[255.00 - 260.00] P:1244.87 E:0.056384 |  He just made no attempt whatsoever, he just stuck his right arm out.
[260.00 - 262.00] P:1397.38 E:0.075520 |  Just a little bit unfortunate with the ball, wasn't he, Robin?
[262.00 - 264.00] P:1337.85 E:0.067376 |  He almost played one of the midfield players in.
[264.00 - 267.00] P:1258.60 E:0.050693 |  What should be Chelsea and Manchester cutting out?
[267.00 - 274.00] P:1269.94 E:0.062013 |  Well, we welcome all service to our five-live and BBC Radio London commentary here,
[274.00 - 279.00] P:1301.15 E:0.061628 |  and Chelsea have a free kick because of the handball taken by Czech,
[279.00 - 282.00] P:1312.45 E:0.061749 |  dropped it for the first time, trying to get away from the defender, but he can't.
[282.00 - 287.00] P:1370.67 E:0.053471 |  Now, the thing is, Mark, Schweinsteiger's now on a yellow card for 88 minutes in the game.
[287.00 - 291.00] P:1473.35 E:0.055155 |  Yeah, and he's not exactly a great tackle, is he, in so far as, I think,
[291.00 - 295.00] P:1554.16 E:0.059410 |  is more of an intercept of a ball, but you know, it might just put him on edge,
[295.00 - 297.00] P:1590.12 E:0.060291 |  which you would help might favour Chelsea a little bit.
[297.00 - 299.00] P:1431.34 E:0.050498 |  Every single advantage you could possibly take.
[299.00 - 304.00] P:1586.01 E:0.056825 |  There is a feeling that Schweinsteiger is carrying an injury as well into this game.
[304.00 - 308.00] P:1381.08 E:0.058281 |  A clearance now by Neuer, the Bayern goalkeeper, and Muller try to reach it.
[308.00 - 312.00] P:1410.66 E:0.053619 |  The ball is now picked up down this near side by Ribery.
[312.00 - 315.00] P:1303.24 E:0.056584 |  Ribery onto the tall Muller, and back again to Ribery.
[315.00 - 318.00] P:1433.66 E:0.056904 |  Gomez is pointing, Ribery's faced by Bersingwer,
[318.00 - 323.00] P:1361.02 E:0.066639 |  drives towards the dead ball line, and then miss-kicks, and doesn't get the cross in.
[323.00 - 329.00] P:1498.94 E:0.056840 |  Much to the delight of the Chelsea fans, banked behind Czech's goal away to our left.
[329.00 - 334.00] P:1326.11 E:0.056625 |  And so on, five-lie, BBC London, and well-service, Bayern Munich-Nil,
[334.00 - 338.00] P:1560.40 E:0.060699 |  Chelsea-Nil in the early stages of the Champions League final.
[338.00 - 340.00] P:1502.98 E:0.062192 |  Mark Lawrence is with us, so too is Steve Bruce.
[340.00 - 346.00] P:1536.12 E:0.055825 |  We'll be hearing from Steve throughout the commentary, as Czech now clears into the Bayern half.
[346.00 - 350.00] P:1539.75 E:0.052771 |  Drogberg gets above Boateng, nobody there to feed off it,
[350.00 - 355.00] P:1512.94 E:0.053325 |  and Bayern Munich pick it up once more, and Kroos goes down under the challenge from Kalu,
[355.00 - 359.00] P:1381.75 E:0.047585 |  and Bayern have a free-kick, which they take quickly, and they find Contento,
[359.00 - 361.00] P:1312.45 E:0.061134 |  just down below us on the left-hand side.
[361.00 - 364.00] P:1376.58 E:0.058235 |  Contento in for Alaba, the Austrian international.
[364.00 - 368.00] P:1297.80 E:0.061902 |  Bayern spreading it through the back four, and building now with Timershoek.
[368.00 - 370.00] P:1222.46 E:0.063416 |  Robbins waiting over on the right-hand side.
[370.00 - 373.00] P:1359.82 E:0.056301 |  Timershoek plays it into Gomez, Gomez now for Muller.
[373.00 - 378.00] P:1478.15 E:0.065175 |  Muller just moving away from Luis, and Schveinstein of a Bayern Munich shot to the deflection,
[378.00 - 380.00] P:1555.33 E:0.060080 |  and it's a corner-kick to Bayern.
[380.00 - 383.00] P:1628.82 E:0.064047 |  Yeah, he just opened up a little bit for him, didn't he?
[383.00 - 385.00] P:1588.68 E:0.055392 |  Took it from right foot to left foot.
[385.00 - 389.00] P:1551.66 E:0.054513 |  It was a great block. I don't know which Chelsea defender it was, it was K-Hill.
[389.00 - 391.00] P:1367.52 E:0.057056 |  He might just throw himself at it.
[392.00 - 396.00] P:1382.06 E:0.066918 |  Bayern have settled down, as you would expect in their own arena,
[396.00 - 398.00] P:1426.48 E:0.062607 |  probably quicker here than Chelsea.
[398.00 - 401.00] P:1488.57 E:0.064341 |  They have this corner-kick, and it's headed away by Drogberg.
[401.00 - 405.00] P:1426.01 E:0.053580 |  Collected once more by Contento. Fantastic noise around the stadium.
[405.00 - 409.00] P:1409.75 E:0.057652 |  As Ribery now once more finds Contento.
[409.00 - 411.00] P:1380.26 E:0.063456 |  Contento's ball in, not cleared yet by Chelsea.
[411.00 - 418.00] P:1656.71 E:0.055064 |  It's played back to Krusen in the end that's struck with power, but no accuracy,
[418.00 - 421.00] P:1640.95 E:0.055382 |  and it doesn't even hit the side netting. It's a goal-kick to Chelsea.
[421.00 - 426.00] P:1485.83 E:0.053837 |  Yeah, and a swine-stiger in the box, Mike, who just, two touches a second was into the feet of Krusen as well.
[426.00 - 428.00] P:1401.19 E:0.055123 |  It wasn't particularly well struck.
[428.00 - 432.00] P:1298.89 E:0.053703 |  Ball from Krusen. It's important, Chelsea, they don't get in the mindset
[432.00 - 436.00] P:1383.55 E:0.056093 |  where they're just going to sit back all the time, because all they will do
[436.00 - 440.00] P:1327.95 E:0.063425 |  is invite the lights of La Metal forward all throughout this game.
[440.00 - 445.00] P:1306.81 E:0.056931 |  So far, and we've only played five minutes, Chelsea haven't been able to get matter on the ball at all.
[445.00 - 451.00] P:1463.05 E:0.060986 |  One of the key moves that Di Matteo's made is to get matter much more centrally involved behind Drogberg.
[451.00 - 454.00] P:1603.47 E:0.054927 |  Now Chelsea trying to put some moves together for the first time.
[454.00 - 457.00] P:1522.63 E:0.057899 |  It's Kalu down this near side, into the aforementioned matter.
[457.00 - 464.00] P:1443.11 E:0.054686 |  Mattis ball back though towards Basingwer, and Chelsea have to give it back to Czech once more, and he clears.
[464.00 - 469.00] P:1567.83 E:0.063412 |  Not very well either. Only two people standing up in front of us here, getting a little over-excited.
[469.00 - 471.00] P:1568.28 E:0.063135 |  It's all right, Greeny's just hit him on the head.
[476.00 - 478.00] P:1534.36 E:0.062879 |  Bayern Munich take a throw.
[479.00 - 483.00] P:1685.85 E:0.056879 |  He'd never be the Minister of Diplomatic Relations, would he, eh?
[483.00 - 485.00] P:1605.07 E:0.062667 |  It might be in Afghanistan, but not here.
[486.00 - 491.00] P:1628.00 E:0.055708 |  But he did his job very effectively, and I'm not sure that guy's going to stand up again.
[491.00 - 493.00] P:1605.76 E:0.046812 |  I don't think he can.
[494.00 - 498.00] P:1584.61 E:0.058471 |  Bayern Munich now with Riebering, just inside the Chelsea half.
[498.00 - 500.00] P:1342.37 E:0.060153 |  Contento's made a run forward.
[500.00 - 503.00] P:1466.14 E:0.061861 |  Riebering slips the ball into the area, Cahill away.
[503.00 - 509.00] P:1381.19 E:0.054761 |  At the moment, Chelsea are on the back foot, and they're not really able to link up in midfield with Lampard and Matter.
[509.00 - 514.00] P:1522.95 E:0.059341 |  They're having to get back behind the ball once more, Robin down that right-hand side, cuts in from the touch line.
[514.00 - 516.00] P:1444.08 E:0.058184 |  Looks for Muller, it's away from Muller.
[516.00 - 518.00] P:1362.10 E:0.058414 |  Miquel's there on the edge of the penalty area.
[518.00 - 525.00] P:1475.49 E:0.057466 |  Lot of Chelsea players back inside their own half now, as Matter tries to screw the ball into Kalu, and Kalu holds it.
[525.00 - 530.00] P:1469.22 E:0.065067 |  And good quick fit here from Kalu. Goes into the Bayern half, sets up Dropper down the right-hand side.
[530.00 - 536.00] P:1555.03 E:0.059266 |  DDA Dropper for Chelsea, Kalu's in the penalty area, and it goes to the back post, and it's too strong for Bertrand.
[536.00 - 538.00] P:1573.77 E:0.054913 |  But that's a little bit better from Chelsea.
[538.00 - 546.00] P:1603.79 E:0.054609 |  Well, it is, Mike, because every time you pose a threat, you make the Bayern defenders just think a little bit about coming forward all the time.
[546.00 - 552.00] P:1341.95 E:0.049446 |  That really is most important. It wasn't a bad ball either from Dropper. Bertrand wasn't too far away from it.
[552.00 - 559.00] P:1361.97 E:0.061187 |  Seven minutes gone in the first half here in the Allianz Arena in Munich. Long ball now for Bayern down that right-hand side.
[559.00 - 562.00] P:1549.16 E:0.060462 |  Muller is galloping down the right, and he just about gets there.
[562.00 - 567.00] P:1623.23 E:0.058073 |  Lewis manages to clear with his heel, and Ashley Cole brings the ball out of the Chelsea.
[567.00 - 570.00] P:1465.10 E:0.061237 |  Brent almost played Michele into trouble. Got out of it well though, Michele.
[570.00 - 574.00] P:1430.75 E:0.062558 |  And now this is better from Chelsea as they spread the play down the right-hand side.
[574.00 - 578.00] P:1387.72 E:0.058034 |  Bersingua holds just inside the Bayern half. Bersingua finds Michele.
[578.00 - 584.00] P:1469.96 E:0.058051 |  Michele nudges the ball onto Bersingua, who's really deep inside the Bayern half at the moment.
[584.00 - 589.00] P:1507.65 E:0.064456 |  Kalu available down the right-hand side. Dropper's in the penalty area. So too is Kalu.
[589.00 - 592.00] P:1547.04 E:0.057027 |  He's got two Bayern players around him. Managers knock it back to Matta.
[592.00 - 595.00] P:1470.33 E:0.057401 |  Matta's crossing is headed away by Bayern Munich's Larm.
[595.00 - 600.00] P:1462.54 E:0.058278 |  And the ball is now back in the centre circle where Lewis tries to get in ahead of Gomez.
[600.00 - 605.00] P:1422.56 E:0.070292 |  And Bayern clip the ball dangerously down the right-hand side, and Robin is on side.
[605.00 - 610.00] P:1392.64 E:0.067950 |  And Gomez is going to try and get in the area, and Robin wasted in the end into the Chelsea fans.
[610.00 - 613.00] P:1535.44 E:0.068713 |  Yeah, he cuts his side favourite left foot and he scoops it over the bar.
[613.00 - 618.00] P:1484.48 E:0.056935 |  You know, at the other end, if Matta's ball hit the far post a little bit,
[618.00 - 622.00] P:1467.85 E:0.051969 |  Dropper and Berserund were absolutely totally unmarked at the far post.
[622.00 - 624.00] P:1477.90 E:0.042593 |  An opportunity for Chelsea.
[624.00 - 628.00] P:1457.62 E:0.058547 |  In a couple of minutes at the 10-minute mark, we'll get Steve Bruce's thoughts on what he's been watching so far.
[628.00 - 633.00] P:1436.88 E:0.060512 |  The game's starting to liven up here, and Petticec now with a goal kick for Chelsea.
[633.00 - 638.00] P:1485.52 E:0.062827 |  Nil-nil here. Checks clearance to the left-hand side, headed back by Larm.
[638.00 - 641.00] P:1519.32 E:0.058780 |  Ashley Cole with a neat little header down to Lampard.
[641.00 - 644.00] P:1731.72 E:0.054284 |  The captain, of course, in the absence of John Terry.
[644.00 - 648.00] P:1713.29 E:0.057385 |  Lampard's ball, very ambitious, headed away by Timershoek.
[648.00 - 653.00] P:1704.48 E:0.055435 |  Of course, Chelsea will fancy that if they can pressurise this Bayern defence, there could be opportunities.
[653.00 - 657.00] P:1511.32 E:0.052640 |  Well, that's it. The two opportunities they've had so far, if you can call them opportunities.
[657.00 - 661.00] P:1424.21 E:0.061389 |  They've had space to run it by, and which I think is really important from Chelsea's point of view.
[661.00 - 667.00] P:1382.41 E:0.065705 |  And if you're just joining us, by the way, Schweinsteiger was booked after a couple of minutes for a deliberate handball.
[667.00 - 672.00] P:1448.16 E:0.059294 |  And now Bayern, as they left to do, build from the back, and Timershoek motors into the Chelsea half.
[672.00 - 677.00] P:1459.66 E:0.055439 |  He's already halfway inside the Chelsea half. Larm takes over on the right-hand side.
[677.00 - 681.00] P:1429.09 E:0.049146 |  This is the far side of the field for Bayern in this first half.
[681.00 - 685.00] P:1515.17 E:0.056174 |  Bayern comfortable in possession now, looking to contento again down the left.
[685.00 - 688.00] P:1372.35 E:0.054976 |  Robin's going to cross to this left-hand side. Where's Ribery?
[688.00 - 695.00] P:1532.61 E:0.049261 |  Ribery's floating at the moment. Now it's Schweinsteiger into Ribery, switched back to Timershoek.
[695.00 - 699.00] P:1450.61 E:0.044754 |  But at the moment, Chelsea containing Bayern Munich.
[699.00 - 705.00] P:1478.96 E:0.058800 |  Bayern again with Larm. Chelsea in the way that they did against Barcelona, marking up, compressing the space here.
[705.00 - 710.00] P:1368.42 E:0.060374 |  Bayern Munich lose it, and then Gomez wins it back again. The whistle's gone, has it? Yes, he has.
[710.00 - 714.00] P:1659.61 E:0.056463 |  Foul on Drogba. Drogba was back helping Chelsea defensive enough.
[714.00 - 716.00] P:1762.18 E:0.062710 |  The game interrupted the ball.
[716.00 - 719.00] P:1688.33 E:0.054799 |  Whereas the game stopped, let's just bring in Steve for his early thoughts. Steve Bruce.
[719.00 - 723.00] P:1521.33 E:0.057929 |  Well, Chelsea in the last two, three minutes have at least got some possession of the ball, which they needed to.
[723.00 - 728.00] P:1376.38 E:0.066316 |  And just as we've just seen there, their organisation defensively, Drogba's back 30 yards from goal-making,
[728.00 - 733.00] P:1370.28 E:0.058359 |  the tackle on the edge of his box, which is essential for them, because they must stay compact.
[733.00 - 738.00] P:1410.02 E:0.064985 |  And at the moment, they've settled down quite nicely. I think the longer the game goes, the better for Chelsea.
[738.00 - 742.00] P:1320.64 E:0.069473 |  Thank you, Steve. And there does seem to be quite a lot of interchange going on with Bayern.
[742.00 - 747.00] P:1503.44 E:0.061645 |  Muller is now on the right, and Robin's gone into Muller's position, just trying to make Chelsea think a little bit as
[747.00 - 752.00] P:1391.48 E:0.057336 |  a ball is floated forward for Chelsea, looking for Kalu, contento off-balance, doesn't really deal with it.
[752.00 - 760.00] P:1557.35 E:0.055494 |  Back comes Rebri, and as he clears, he's been caught, and the referee gives the free-kick to Bayern Munich.
[760.00 - 763.00] P:1573.32 E:0.049342 |  And it's a very fluid system at the moment, Bayern are playing down there.
[763.00 - 769.00] P:1602.77 E:0.056671 |  Yeah, it is, but you'd expect that. They're very good at interchanging. They're all very, very quick.
[769.00 - 774.00] P:1674.28 E:0.055418 |  Muller's got the opportunity to run where he wants, and try and pick some holes from Chelsea's defence from their point of view.
[774.00 - 780.00] P:1449.20 E:0.049535 |  But Chelsea are OK at the moment, Mike. And the times they've come forward a couple of times, it's been encouraging.
[780.00 - 782.00] P:1637.94 E:0.050106 |  They must keep that.
[782.00 - 788.00] P:1472.86 E:0.059580 |  Fiensteiger, who won't venture too far forward, he'll try and let Cruz go forward as much as he possibly can.
[788.00 - 793.00] P:1492.44 E:0.057262 |  On five live and war service in BBC London, here in Munich, it's 0-0 in the Champions League final,
[793.00 - 797.00] P:1471.25 E:0.056471 |  and it's the fairhead Timershoek firing the ball down the right-hand side.
[797.00 - 803.00] P:1516.04 E:0.056317 |  Lawn may lose this ball, Chelsea marking tight on him, and then in the end, sensibly Bertrand from distance
[803.00 - 809.00] P:1546.21 E:0.050947 |  gives the ball back to his goalkeeper, Czech. And Czech just sorts himself out, addresses the ball,
[809.00 - 814.00] P:1366.43 E:0.052006 |  and finds Gary Cahill just on the edge of the penalty area. Cahill into Miquel.
[814.00 - 821.00] P:1601.36 E:0.058066 |  Miquel started quite well. Nice touch from Calou onto Basingua, who runs out of space, and he's firmly tackled by Contento.
[821.00 - 825.00] P:1666.09 E:0.051949 |  And it's going to be a throw into Chelsea, just about on the half-way line down here.
[825.00 - 831.00] P:1452.53 E:0.051792 |  Basingua to take it. Basingua just holding. Nobody really helping him at the moment.
[831.00 - 836.00] P:1523.40 E:0.047575 |  Now, Drogba makes the move, and offers himself, and Drogba gets it, and flicks it down to Matta,
[836.00 - 841.00] P:1431.41 E:0.057230 |  and Matta gets it away from Muller, and it's lampard in the centre-circle, back again to Matta.
[841.00 - 846.00] P:1313.10 E:0.051784 |  Matta veering to the left-hand side. Stab back again to Miquel.
[846.00 - 852.00] P:1587.37 E:0.055558 |  Chelsea lose it on the break by Munich, but Miquel's as quick as a flash coming across to cover the danger.
[852.00 - 859.00] P:1549.84 E:0.052167 |  Well, that's his job. That's what he's there for, to just... all those specific instances, just to come and muck up the play for Chelsea.
[859.00 - 863.00] P:1519.86 E:0.063736 |  Interestingly, by Munich, we're just looking to pounce there as Chelsea had possession.
[863.00 - 867.00] P:1475.66 E:0.060609 |  Whistle's gone from the referee from Portugal once more. Yeah, far by Luis. Far by Luis.
[867.00 - 876.00] P:1431.21 E:0.047894 |  This is a free kick to Bayern Munich, and they just take it gently, and now they find Kruse on the half-way line.
[876.00 - 879.00] P:1330.77 E:0.063370 |  Immediately onto Ribri, a cross comes for Basingua once more.
[879.00 - 886.00] P:1393.64 E:0.058195 |  Kalu filters back to help the full back. It's Kruse for Bayern, into the ever-available Timershock inside the centre-circle.
[886.00 - 892.00] P:1424.35 E:0.056794 |  Arrowed forward towards Muller, it's back with Laam. Laam now to the unmarked Feinsteiger.
[892.00 - 898.00] P:1398.00 E:0.056481 |  Chelsea need to get tight on Schweinsteiger. Schweinsteiger gives it to Ribri down this left-hand side.
[898.00 - 903.00] P:1537.21 E:0.064523 |  Ribri with his right foot strokes it in, and it's headed over by Gomez. He made the run. Luis followed him.
[903.00 - 906.00] P:1729.07 E:0.053399 |  Gomez couldn't control the header down, and it's gone into the crowd.
[906.00 - 910.00] P:1633.10 E:0.056683 |  Yeah, he got too much on it. Good ball as well, him from the left-hand side, right footed.
[910.00 - 916.00] P:1698.88 E:0.049673 |  But Gomez just got too much on it. He just wanted a skimmed header as much as anything, and with too much on it, he just took it over the crossbar.
[916.00 - 920.00] P:1522.28 E:0.063052 |  He's lethal, though, Gomez. 12 goals in the Champions League, one in the qualifiers as well.
[920.00 - 928.00] P:1492.30 E:0.050392 |  Just too behind Lionel Messi, which, of course, is an all-time record in a season in either the European Cup or the Champions League.
[928.00 - 933.00] P:1482.26 E:0.054844 |  Clearance by Chelsea. Drogba's going to try and get this. Can't quite... No, he might get it second time. He does.
[933.00 - 939.00] P:1357.27 E:0.050139 |  Knocks it down this near side to Bersingua. K-Hills there at the back, and now it's with Luis.
[939.00 - 947.00] P:1248.63 E:0.055035 |  Luis playing sensibly so far. No runs from him yet. Lampard over on that left-hand side, trying to play it down the line to Bertrand.
[947.00 - 958.00] P:1370.70 E:0.055934 |  There's no space here for Chelsea over on that far side. Larm emerges with the ball. Then a Chelsea tackle goes in, and the Leinsmann's flag that it has gone out of play, and Bayern Munich have a throw in.
[958.00 - 967.00] P:1409.02 E:0.055561 |  Chelsea playing, though, so far with good discipline, good organisation, and Schweinsteiger now sets another Bayern Munich attack moving.
[967.00 - 974.00] P:1290.15 E:0.051357 |  Cross hit it too strong to Robin. Far too strong, and so far it's OK.
[974.00 - 982.00] P:1502.66 E:0.058570 |  No, it's fine, mate. It's absolutely fine. There are a couple of opportunities where they've cut in by Munich, but not really trouble Pettercek as such.
[982.00 - 989.00] P:1574.81 E:0.060907 |  And it's just important for Chelsea to keep the shape. It doesn't matter who's in which particular holes, as long as somebody's in there.
[989.00 - 992.00] P:1277.24 E:0.044776 |  If they open up against Bayern, they're in trouble.
[992.00 - 999.00] P:1527.72 E:0.057912 |  So from Czech's clearance, Drogba can't reach it, but Ashley Cole tucks in down that left-hand side, and Bertrand now tries to move away from La.
[999.00 - 1008.00] P:1356.54 E:0.055734 |  Ashley Cole, very tight now, lampard. Immediately swamped by a couple of Bayern players, but Chelsea keep the ball, and they play through their backfall.
[1008.00 - 1016.00] P:1607.59 E:0.057673 |  Cahill, oh, under pressure from Munich. Just wanted a little bit too much time there, Cahill, got it back to his goalkeeper, and now it's back into the Bayern half,
[1016.00 - 1023.00] P:1519.53 E:0.055421 |  and Boateng gets in first in front of Drogba. Miquel with some very clever play, and now Matta switches the ball in field to Miquel,
[1023.00 - 1031.00] P:1478.06 E:0.061447 |  given early to Colou, who's tackled by Contento, 50-50 in midfield. Bayern emerge with the ball. It's the pace of Robin.
[1031.00 - 1038.00] P:1432.06 E:0.058026 |  Robin feeds, Rieberi, Gomez and Mouller may be available. Rieberi's just inside the penalty area. Rieberi can't get the cross in.
[1038.00 - 1043.00] P:1566.44 E:0.054078 |  Chelsea are double marking him, but then clear poorly, and Rieberi has another opportunity.
[1043.00 - 1050.00] P:1613.39 E:0.052747 |  Knocks it back to Kruse. Gomez made a burst into the penalty area. Bayern just hold on the edge of that area.
[1050.00 - 1057.00] P:1384.08 E:0.063020 |  Back again to Rieberi once more, still 0-0 in the Alliance arena, and we play nearly 16 minutes of the first half.
[1057.00 - 1063.00] P:1311.57 E:0.061793 |  Bayern have had more of the ball, but Chelsea so far are coping. Tim is shook to long over on the Bayern right.
[1063.00 - 1070.00] P:1353.14 E:0.059643 |  All the Chelsea players apart from Drogba are effectively back behind the ball. Gomez turns, Chelsea break up the Bayern attack,
[1070.00 - 1076.00] P:1439.74 E:0.058968 |  and Miquel swings it hopefully into the Bayern half, and Drogba may get a chance here, because Bayern haven't cut it out,
[1076.00 - 1083.00] P:1464.54 E:0.053558 |  but then Drogba can't find matter, and Bayern build, and it's given early to Kruse, and Chelsea have to concentrate once more.
[1083.00 - 1091.00] P:1441.97 E:0.053039 |  They will have to focus for every single second of this evening. It's Mouller down the Bayern right. Mouller just moving forward slowly,
[1091.00 - 1097.00] P:1577.86 E:0.058682 |  and it goes to Gomez. No return ball. Lucky break though for Gomez. Suspicion of a hand as well there.
[1097.00 - 1102.00] P:1513.31 E:0.059981 |  Laam again into Robin. Back again to Laam. Laam tackled by Chelsea on the edge of the penalty area,
[1102.00 - 1109.00] P:1467.77 E:0.053107 |  and now Matter takes it to the far touch line, uses Drogba, and Drogba invites the challenge, manages to get it back,
[1109.00 - 1114.00] P:1458.82 E:0.057783 |  and then Chelsea give it away, and that's one thing that DiMatteo's team will have to do better in possession.
[1114.00 - 1119.00] P:1541.15 E:0.054276 |  They can't just give it straight back to Bayern. They've got to be able to keep the ball.
[1119.00 - 1125.00] P:1530.80 E:0.059548 |  Unfortunately for Chelsea, Bayern are, some of the Bayern passing also is way out of range.
[1125.00 - 1133.00] P:1517.38 E:0.052028 |  That's another one from Kroos. Yeah, that's gone wide over on the far side, and Chelsea have a throw in which Ashley Cole will take,
[1133.00 - 1139.00] P:1373.77 E:0.057933 |  and has to be very careful because as he's right by his corner flag, has to make sure this is clean,
[1139.00 - 1147.00] P:1315.26 E:0.057215 |  and that this doesn't ricochet away from his side. Ashley Cole's throw for Chelsea, doing a good containing job early on here.
[1147.00 - 1154.00] P:1401.57 E:0.060939 |  Drogba, back inside his own half, over his head. There's only Kalu downfield. Kalu trying to get away from Contento,
[1154.00 - 1159.00] P:1353.23 E:0.051662 |  and referee has penalised Kalu, and Bayern have taken the kick very quickly.
[1159.00 - 1164.00] P:1326.25 E:0.060472 |  Referee allowing them to do it, which is a good sign, allowing the game to continue.
[1164.00 - 1168.00] P:1599.78 E:0.052653 |  One yellow card early on here, Bischweinsteiger, and now Contento again.
[1168.00 - 1174.00] P:1505.76 E:0.055181 |  The full back, Rebury on the outside. Contento hands over to Rebury.
[1174.00 - 1179.00] P:1523.01 E:0.051163 |  Muller and Gomez and Robin are all in the penalty area. Rebury hasn't got this one in yet.
[1179.00 - 1186.00] P:1647.79 E:0.060306 |  Rebury now into Muller. Good turn from Muller. Ball played in dangerously, and Chelsea can see the corner kick.
[1186.00 - 1192.00] P:1709.31 E:0.054532 |  I know they've done well against Chelsea, they just turned on the outside, Muller got an early left foot cross in, it was dealt with.
[1192.00 - 1200.00] P:1603.72 E:0.054418 |  They've been great Chelsea because they've been staying on their feet, they've been trying to shunt all the Bayern players into the middle where Chelsea have got the numbers.
[1200.00 - 1206.00] P:1563.66 E:0.066138 |  This is going to be a corner kick for Bayern Munich to be taken by Kruse, and it hasn't been cleared, and Robin got a shot in,
[1206.00 - 1212.00] P:1568.10 E:0.058230 |  it takes the deflection off at Chelsea Defender, I don't know if that was intended, it was a very deep corner,
[1212.00 - 1217.00] P:1600.50 E:0.059672 |  and it travelled an awful long way, there was an attempted diving header by Chelsea, it didn't work.
[1217.00 - 1221.00] P:1479.54 E:0.059466 |  Robin got a shot in, now Cech gets a hand to it over on the far post following the corner,
[1221.00 - 1227.00] P:1460.65 E:0.048260 |  Kruse comes at Timershoek, and he's going to settle for the throw in to Bayern Munich, and it's taken by Robin.
[1227.00 - 1232.00] P:1538.65 E:0.070074 |  Hurl down to Muller, Muller's four, Gomez with a chance, Chelsea have to be careful here,
[1232.00 - 1237.00] P:1418.65 E:0.062975 |  oh a miss kick from Bersingwer, should have cleared it, and it's a corner, and Chelsea at 6-7s.
[1237.00 - 1244.00] P:1602.82 E:0.057413 |  Well Muller did brilliantly, it's very well worked ball into Muller, he played Gomez in, he just needed to hit it first time.
[1244.00 - 1253.00] P:1564.51 E:0.052425 |  Kruse with a ball in which in the end defeats Muller at the far post, and travels to the far side for Chelsea's right,
[1253.00 - 1255.00] P:1395.78 E:0.053607 |  well that was a little bit anxious.
[1255.00 - 1264.00] P:1497.70 E:0.060161 |  Well Gomez, he's just got to hit it, he tried to do a sort of drag back almost, he's just got to whack it at the goal, that was a chance.
[1265.00 - 1271.00] P:1438.22 E:0.063060 |  Chelsea throwing sensibly just taking their time, mopping their brows under a little bit of pressure,
[1271.00 - 1278.00] P:1499.89 E:0.049334 |  and Ashley Cole prepares to take the throw with nearly 19 minutes gone in the first half, 0-0.
[1278.00 - 1283.00] P:1505.63 E:0.050723 |  Bayern have had territorially more of the game so far, but you'd expect that in their own backyard,
[1283.00 - 1288.00] P:1339.09 E:0.058535 |  and now Miquel has to take possession for Chelsea, and he sends the ball down the right hand side,
[1288.00 - 1294.00] P:1498.39 E:0.059897 |  Colou will gallop across but won't get it, Chelsea's passing has to be better than that when they have the opportunity.
[1295.00 - 1301.00] P:1468.07 E:0.051983 |  Yeah the other thing as well is otherwise the likes of Druckweir aren't going to run for anything at the moment, he's extremely fresh,
[1301.00 - 1305.00] P:1406.13 E:0.060609 |  and Timershut comes out from the back, he doesn't pick him up, pick him up, he's just saving himself,
[1305.00 - 1310.00] P:1442.41 E:0.056847 |  but keep sticking balls like that for Druckweir or at Colou, they're not going to go in the end.
[1310.00 - 1315.00] P:1510.14 E:0.057422 |  Mark Lawrensen, Steve Bruce with us, another word from Steven a few seconds, as we move towards the 20 minute mark here,
[1315.00 - 1323.00] P:1371.27 E:0.055754 |  Bayern Munich 0, Chelsea 0 in the Champions League final of 2012, once more Chelsea retreat,
[1323.00 - 1329.00] P:1399.93 E:0.055160 |  as Bayern have the possession, but of course Chelsea will make it as difficult as possible in the way they did against Barcelona,
[1329.00 - 1339.00] P:1378.26 E:0.049680 |  for Barcelona to find space and opportunity, La, and Barcelona just forced to play along the back four at the moment,
[1339.00 - 1348.00] P:1432.37 E:0.049195 |  and now at Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Schweinsteiger to Timershut, Timershut who hasn't had to do very much defending early on here.
[1348.00 - 1354.00] P:1250.32 E:0.049278 |  Bayern playing quite slowly and Chelsea have the players once more apart from Drogba back,
[1354.00 - 1360.00] P:1471.30 E:0.053755 |  and Chelsea frustrating Bayern, they're forcing them backwards and now La can spring down that right hand side,
[1360.00 - 1365.00] P:1597.80 E:0.054695 |  Ashley Cole immediately tries to hold him up, but he picks out Kruse, who's great at finding space in midfield.
[1365.00 - 1370.00] P:1614.72 E:0.048028 |  Now it's Robin down the left, onto Ribery, they're the two danger men of course in this side,
[1370.00 - 1377.00] P:1580.84 E:0.052458 |  Ribery just outside the penalty area, Miquel got a block, but Robin picks up the possession once more and finds Contento,
[1377.00 - 1383.00] P:1686.19 E:0.051140 |  Contento back again to Robin, these are dangerous moments for Chelsea, as Robin plays a 1-2,
[1383.00 - 1390.00] P:1412.86 E:0.070039 |  and Robin in the end almost got that in, checks somehow makes a save, and it's cleared for a corner kick,
[1390.00 - 1396.00] P:1670.61 E:0.059262 |  Robin's strike, he's fighting his thumbs at the moment, wondering how that didn't go in, check has denied it.
[1396.00 - 1401.00] P:1782.55 E:0.058742 |  Well, check saved it, he didn't know much about it, and look for a split second,
[1401.00 - 1405.00] P:1637.06 E:0.050575 |  it's going to sneak in, crawl into the bottom of the net, but Chelsea survive.
[1405.00 - 1410.00] P:1648.91 E:0.058037 |  And Bayern Munich have another corner kick, and this time Chelsea get it out of the penalty area,
[1410.00 - 1414.00] P:1523.07 E:0.051908 |  but back come the team all in red once more, this needs clearing from Lampard,
[1414.00 - 1420.00] P:1559.33 E:0.057376 |  he manages to manoeuvre the ball down the line, and Matt has done very well to keep it in, terrific skill from the Spaniard,
[1420.00 - 1426.00] P:1631.67 E:0.058506 |  and a long ball across the field to Young Bertrand, good first touch from him, onto Colou's run offside,
[1426.00 - 1432.00] P:1649.56 E:0.049827 |  and almost the halfway point of the first half, let's have another word from Steve, Steve Bruce.
[1432.00 - 1438.00] P:1737.41 E:0.053026 |  Well defensively Chelsea have just got away with one there as we said, but we know the defensive organisation is particularly good,
[1438.00 - 1443.00] P:1451.97 E:0.048707 |  the one thing where I have to say is that they have to keep the ball better, certainly in offensive areas,
[1443.00 - 1447.00] P:1446.85 E:0.059425 |  and that's the one thing where they've got the defensive flag Bertrand playing on the left,
[1447.00 - 1451.00] P:1456.44 E:0.055453 |  it gives you no out ball if they possibly come when they've won possession.
[1451.00 - 1460.00] P:1548.03 E:0.053818 |  Thank you Steve, 22 minutes gone in the first half here in Munich, Bayern Munich threatening Chelsea at the moment, surviving,
[1460.00 - 1467.00] P:1489.31 E:0.057823 |  haven't really seen a great deal of Chelsea as an attacking force, and the very fact that Timberschuk is coming forward all the time from the back here,
[1467.00 - 1473.00] P:1568.19 E:0.054974 |  he is of course a midfield player, and he finds Robin down the right, gives it early to Muller, back again to Robin,
[1473.00 - 1480.00] P:1673.58 E:0.051567 |  Robin's the source of most of the danger, and Bayern win a corner this time over on the right hand side, and here's Alan Green.
[1480.00 - 1488.00] P:1542.93 E:0.056736 |  Well maybe it's because I'm watching and not commentating, but I'm far more worried than you too are, I really think Chelsea have been rocking
[1488.00 - 1495.00] P:1522.76 E:0.051592 |  over the last 10 minutes, Robin to take the corner for Bayern Munich from the right, played in left footed,
[1495.00 - 1501.00] P:1287.67 E:0.052868 |  and headed up and away by Didier Drogba, dropping towards Lamm on the far side, cushioned header by the captain,
[1501.00 - 1508.00] P:1381.36 E:0.053632 |  then the volley cross into the penalty area by Robin again, Chelsea clear once more, Timberschuk jumps, beats Kalu in the air,
[1508.00 - 1514.00] P:1421.07 E:0.051344 |  now it's headed away by Ashley Cole, and still it's with Bayern again.
[1514.00 - 1519.00] P:1695.39 E:0.053048 |  Chelsea don't get touching the ball, friendly move on a couple of passes.
[1519.00 - 1527.00] P:1535.51 E:0.053441 |  Here's Schweinsteiger, Schweinsteiger to Ribbri, largely down the left side at the moment for Bayern Munich,
[1527.00 - 1533.00] P:1401.42 E:0.052522 |  Robin has joined him on occasion, which makes the doubling up on the far side dependably for Chelsea not so good,
[1533.00 - 1540.00] P:1510.93 E:0.055240 |  but Robin's down the right now as he takes up possession, good ball into the penalty area, and the cross in towards Gomez,
[1540.00 - 1543.00] P:1552.43 E:0.053152 |  but ahead of Gomez, and it's behind for a goal kick.
[1543.00 - 1548.00] P:1717.74 E:0.055210 |  That was a close that Alan, absolutely brilliant, it was just a little bit too good for Gomez,
[1548.00 - 1553.00] P:1692.54 E:0.050596 |  I don't think Gomez expected it, it was just a twisted and turning and the ball came in brilliantly.
[1553.00 - 1557.00] P:1488.72 E:0.054076 |  Just seeing a replay of that Robin effort, I think it hit the post, it did.
[1557.00 - 1566.00] P:1550.54 E:0.049237 |  It wasn't just a save by Czech, Czech sort of pushed it up and it hit the corner of goal post across bar.
[1566.00 - 1568.00] P:1462.60 E:0.038949 |  Yeah, that'll be the angle then.
[1568.00 - 1576.00] P:1538.82 E:0.049669 |  Something like that, you two didn't notice it, anyway, it's still 0-0, which frankly is as good as Chelsea can hope for at the moment.
[1576.00 - 1582.00] P:1451.89 E:0.049230 |  Cruz trying to squeeze the pass through, but it comes off Lampard into Bayern's possession again,
[1582.00 - 1587.00] P:1438.48 E:0.058513 |  Contento is playing well at left back, Contento coming forward, deliberately played it off the single,
[1587.00 - 1591.00] P:1805.07 E:0.054757 |  and it's behind for yet another corner to the German side.
[1591.00 - 1594.00] P:1737.55 E:0.051357 |  Yeah, you just feel the pressure starting to build on Chelsea, don't you?
[1594.00 - 1598.00] P:1617.01 E:0.056148 |  They can't get out of their own half, when they do, they've given the ball away,
[1598.00 - 1601.00] P:1575.77 E:0.057086 |  and they're just starting to look a little bit creaky.
[1601.00 - 1608.00] P:1556.09 E:0.054680 |  Ribbry's corner from the left, played in right footed, deep, it comes Czech and Czech gets both hands on the ball,
[1608.00 - 1615.00] P:1423.97 E:0.046747 |  preventing it reaching Schweinsteiger, and now he rules it out, underarm to the far side of the field, it's Kalu.
[1615.00 - 1622.00] P:1357.92 E:0.050867 |  Matt is unmarked on the right side, I wonder if Chelsea can spot him, it's with Lampard now, back to Miquel, Matt is still unmarked,
[1622.00 - 1628.00] P:1289.12 E:0.052969 |  and finally Miquel picks out the Spaniard, though he had to run in field to collect possession, then he lost it,
[1628.00 - 1635.00] P:1376.81 E:0.050577 |  Miquel helps him out again, back to Lampard, Lampard hits the ball hurriedly forward, onto the chest of Lyon,
[1635.00 - 1638.00] P:1501.78 E:0.048419 |  good control by the captain, and back to goalkeeper Nore.
[1638.00 - 1643.00] P:1575.23 E:0.054421 |  Yeah, just went for Hollywood, Nore, if the pass wasn't on, just kicked the ball for a while.
[1643.00 - 1650.00] P:1482.12 E:0.053748 |  25 minutes play, he's listening to 5-5, BBC London, 94.9, and World Service,
[1650.00 - 1660.00] P:1647.41 E:0.061489 |  and it's still Bayern Munich, Nils, Chelsea, Nils, and anyone who dodged it, as some of us did, whether this was entirely a home game for Bayern Munich,
[1660.00 - 1662.00] P:1599.22 E:0.061301 |  need only look around this arena.
[1662.00 - 1665.00] P:1583.27 E:0.046622 |  Droppo's clever there, you know, he's just...
[1665.00 - 1666.00] P:1683.83 E:0.071475 |  He jumped into Vote.
[1666.00 - 1670.00] P:1556.99 E:0.051787 |  Well, he just made him dive and jump over him to earn a free kick.
[1670.00 - 1677.00] P:1475.64 E:0.051118 |  So it's a relieving free kick for Chelsea, and it's just on the edge of the centre circle,
[1677.00 - 1684.00] P:1392.17 E:0.055158 |  haven't seen a great deal of Lampard, Matta's going to take it, he's got Miquel to his right, Lampard to his left,
[1684.00 - 1692.00] P:1478.65 E:0.054827 |  we play nearly 26 minutes, still 0-0 in the 2012 Champions League final, Matta touched the ball to Lampard,
[1692.00 - 1697.00] P:1362.57 E:0.048492 |  Lampard now chips it to the left side, and it's headed back to Cahill, who'd come up for the free kick.
[1697.00 - 1703.00] P:1497.93 E:0.056204 |  On the pass, Chelsea lose possession, and it goes out of a Chelsea first, going to be a Bayern throw.
[1703.00 - 1705.00] P:1608.99 E:0.052729 |  I just think it's an attacking ball, Chelsea aren't in it.
[1705.00 - 1708.00] P:1589.77 E:0.051402 |  Well, they're just trying to force it, Alan, that's the problem, but you know,
[1708.00 - 1713.00] P:1597.02 E:0.054739 |  but sometimes when you haven't seen the ball a while, you have to feel sometimes that you want to make an effect with it,
[1713.00 - 1717.00] P:1723.86 E:0.050367 |  when all you really have to do is just keep getting a touch of it.
[1717.00 - 1724.00] P:1385.96 E:0.051338 |  I was hoping that Timershoot would be a weak link in the Bayern defence, but so far the Ukrainians played well.
[1724.00 - 1726.00] P:1598.09 E:0.054917 |  Nothing's been under a lot of pressure.
[1726.00 - 1731.00] P:1740.54 E:0.058594 |  He's come out and just played in midfield, isn't he, which is fine, but he will come under pressure at some stage.
[1731.00 - 1737.00] P:1487.67 E:0.049971 |  Goten clears, but he clatters into Dragwa, out of play for a throw-in, throw-in taken,
[1737.00 - 1744.00] P:1469.76 E:0.048579 |  here's Gruz playing in a deeper position tonight for Bayern Munich because of the suspension of Gustavo,
[1744.00 - 1747.00] P:1352.24 E:0.052814 |  forcing Muller's introduction to the team.
[1747.00 - 1750.00] P:1255.20 E:0.054416 |  Here is Muller on the far side of the field, into Robin.
[1750.00 - 1753.00] P:1337.72 E:0.053138 |  Robin plays it wide to Lampard, to the right of the penalty area.
[1753.00 - 1759.00] P:1392.74 E:0.050235 |  Lampard checks, he won't cross it left-footed, plays it back to Schveinsteiger, onto Muller again.
[1759.00 - 1766.00] P:1319.81 E:0.053421 |  Schveinsteiger to Contento, left side of the field, it's all Bayern at the moment, 18 minutes to half-time, 0-0.
[1766.00 - 1773.00] P:1345.50 E:0.049306 |  Now, Ribery takes it up, he was suspended two years ago and missed the defeat by Inter Milan in the final in Madrid.
[1773.00 - 1779.00] P:1306.68 E:0.057242 |  It's on the far side now with La, and I'd love to see the possession stats.
[1779.00 - 1782.00] P:1370.82 E:0.057794 |  It's overwhelmingly in favour of the German side.
[1782.00 - 1785.00] P:1456.40 E:0.063748 |  Now, here's Muller, outside the penalty, oh, that was clever.
[1785.00 - 1790.00] P:1645.31 E:0.066161 |  He knew that Luis was going to come into, and boy, did he work for that free kick and he got it.
[1790.00 - 1794.00] P:1780.66 E:0.056601 |  Yeah, he just, he, Luis just wanted to have a nip at him, didn't he, and try and take the ball.
[1794.00 - 1798.00] P:1693.53 E:0.056204 |  He's obviously caught him, very clever, he shoved his arm across.
[1798.00 - 1800.00] P:1839.03 E:0.060305 |  You're precisely what he was doing. Absolutely.
[1800.00 - 1809.00] P:1582.64 E:0.053394 |  Now, he's, what, four yards outside the penalty area, to the right of the D, as Bayern look at it, and it's Arjen Robin.
[1809.00 - 1817.00] P:1780.53 E:0.043491 |  Now, with clues that Robin must be favourite to take this, Chelsea dare not wilt.
[1817.00 - 1825.00] P:1724.16 E:0.045828 |  Robin waits, the Portuguese referee forcing the Chelsea wall back the full 10 yards.
[1825.00 - 1831.00] P:1499.75 E:0.052450 |  He's already been in charge in this arena as Bayern Munich lost two Champions League games.
[1831.00 - 1834.00] P:1346.55 E:0.044530 |  That was a good omen for Chelsea tonight.
[1835.00 - 1840.00] P:1379.21 E:0.045473 |  And we still wait for the free kick. He's talking to the Chelsea wall.
[1840.00 - 1845.00] P:1390.03 E:0.045596 |  Robin or Cruz, take your pick. Bayern Munich hope for a goal.
[1845.00 - 1850.00] P:1708.03 E:0.053374 |  16 and a half minutes to half time. Here comes Robin, plays it straight into the wall,
[1850.00 - 1853.00] P:1379.47 E:0.057577 |  for a free kick, and it rebounds out of play of the far side.
[1853.00 - 1857.00] P:1582.91 E:0.050691 |  Yeah, good wall from Chelsea's point of view, big, big and strong did his job.
[1858.00 - 1864.00] P:1454.74 E:0.052712 |  Throw-in is taken by Laud, back to Timershaw, and Bote on the halfway line,
[1864.00 - 1869.00] P:1493.96 E:0.056635 |  left of the centre circle onto Contento, who's Wallace played left midfield.
[1869.00 - 1871.00] P:1355.12 E:0.044347 |  He hasn't any defending to do.
[1871.00 - 1877.00] P:1401.74 E:0.053046 |  Taken up now by Schweinsteiger, running forward onto Contento, but wasn't the pass that Contento was expecting,
[1877.00 - 1880.00] P:1438.37 E:0.044001 |  and he can't keep possession, and he's had to play for a throw-in to Chelsea.
[1880.00 - 1882.00] P:1617.92 E:0.058292 |  Just a little bit on his heels, wasn't he, Contento?
[1882.00 - 1887.00] P:1421.08 E:0.058106 |  What we don't know, obviously, at the moment, Alan and Chelsea are fine, it's 0-0, yes, they're under pressure,
[1887.00 - 1890.00] P:1525.41 E:0.057991 |  Checks had to make the save, the ball came off the post, etc.
[1890.00 - 1893.00] P:1581.13 E:0.065582 |  But we don't know how hard they're having to work at the moment,
[1893.00 - 1898.00] P:1396.08 E:0.056070 |  we probably won't see the effects of that, so probably 70 minutes plus.
[1899.00 - 1902.00] P:1337.44 E:0.065468 |  The one thing Steve Bruce says, the longer it goes at 0-0,
[1902.00 - 1905.00] P:1294.91 E:0.050402 |  hopefully the more frustrated Bayern will get.
[1905.00 - 1909.00] P:1461.56 E:0.053425 |  Well, that's what I said before the game, they'll be delighted that they can get half an hour.
[1909.00 - 1914.00] P:1421.52 E:0.060286 |  The longer it goes for me, the better for Chelsea, but we must see them take care of the ball better.
[1914.00 - 1916.00] P:1412.14 E:0.056505 |  That's the disappointing thing at the moment.
[1916.00 - 1920.00] P:1678.01 E:0.053469 |  We've got to throw in, for instance, now, you know, and look, they should be giving it,
[1920.00 - 1922.00] P:1487.80 E:0.048591 |  and they're keeping possession, they've got a little bit of it.
[1922.00 - 1926.00] P:1453.68 E:0.070493 |  Good header by Drogba, on fed-on to Kalu, Kalu approaching the penalty,
[1926.00 - 1931.00] P:1523.69 E:0.060422 |  I was first in the penalty here, but he ran into Phillip Lam, and it's taken away,
[1931.00 - 1935.00] P:1728.20 E:0.056570 |  and he goes out off, actually, called for a throw-in, sorry to put in there, Steve, on some of the good things.
[1935.00 - 1936.00] P:1790.55 E:0.058185 |  It's a pleasure.
[1936.00 - 1940.00] P:1922.73 E:0.056556 |  It's a pleasure, no, it's the first time we've seen a little, that they've put two, three passes together,
[1940.00 - 1942.00] P:1680.70 E:0.053783 |  and had a chance at the Bayern goal.
[1943.00 - 1946.00] P:1446.79 E:0.052422 |  It ain't happening often enough to calm my nerves.
[1946.00 - 1954.00] P:1275.41 E:0.042930 |  Bayern Munich 0, Chelsea 0, Bultank with a quarter of an hour left in the first half, onto Contenta,
[1954.00 - 1961.00] P:1437.78 E:0.049335 |  and now, Ribri, and Ribri filed by Busingua, and Ribri rolling around.
[1962.00 - 1964.00] P:1852.14 E:0.057507 |  Don't think it's that bad a tackle.
[1965.00 - 1966.00] P:1856.13 E:0.084462 |  Ribri thinks it is.
[1967.00 - 1969.00] P:1983.11 E:0.072104 |  He's catching his face now.
[1969.00 - 1971.00] P:1946.58 E:0.068637 |  He's caught him on the back of the car, fella.
[1971.00 - 1972.00] P:1948.45 E:0.046210 |  Has he?
[1973.00 - 1975.00] P:1918.59 E:0.057809 |  Oh, yes, he hit, he did, actually.
[1976.00 - 1978.00] P:1806.08 E:0.052572 |  So Ribri is every right to go down.
[1978.00 - 1983.00] P:1636.26 E:0.050764 |  The trouble is, as Mike and I experienced, practically every game that we do,
[1983.00 - 1989.00] P:1379.49 E:0.057259 |  you see players rolling around, and 90% of the time, they're feigning injury.
[1989.00 - 1990.00] P:1362.63 E:0.051024 |  Now, that hurt.
[1990.00 - 1991.00] P:1300.34 E:0.068370 |  But that hurt.
[1991.00 - 1994.00] P:1514.64 E:0.060476 |  That did hurt, and if the referee had actually seen...
[1994.00 - 1997.00] P:1443.05 E:0.060654 |  The contact made by a... Yeah, it would have been here.
[1998.00 - 2005.00] P:1285.28 E:0.055232 |  Well, Ribri is receiving treatment, and Jepanques, the Bayern coach,
[2005.00 - 2009.00] P:1468.25 E:0.051695 |  are also talking to Schreinsteiger and to Cruz.
[2009.00 - 2013.00] P:1355.66 E:0.048213 |  He must be reasonably happy with the way things are going for Bayern Munich at the moment,
[2013.00 - 2015.00] P:1609.32 E:0.061728 |  but no other goal.
[2015.00 - 2017.00] P:1683.35 E:0.046055 |  Yeah, a goal because of the pressure and the play, certainly.
[2019.00 - 2021.00] P:1421.46 E:0.062700 |  So Busingua fortunate.
[2021.00 - 2023.00] P:1345.17 E:0.064941 |  Ribri is now off the field.
[2023.00 - 2025.00] P:1479.85 E:0.056769 |  I'm sure he'll be back on.
[2025.00 - 2027.00] P:1853.07 E:0.051923 |  Well, it's a kick, isn't it? So he should be fine.
[2027.00 - 2028.00] P:1442.89 E:0.031199 |  Get over the pain.
[2028.00 - 2029.00] P:1804.34 E:0.054269 |  Free kick's taken.
[2029.00 - 2032.00] P:1316.97 E:0.049261 |  Ribri's ready when the referee weighs him back on.
[2032.00 - 2034.00] P:1361.99 E:0.044669 |  Bayern temporarily down to 10-man.
[2034.00 - 2036.00] P:1177.74 E:0.055230 |  Ball on the far side to Robin.
[2036.00 - 2037.00] P:1283.16 E:0.062097 |  Robin feels it.
[2037.00 - 2039.00] P:1457.75 E:0.061313 |  Audricoma's great control by the striker.
[2039.00 - 2040.00] P:1507.74 E:0.053092 |  Gomez, edge of the penalty here.
[2040.00 - 2041.00] P:1208.65 E:0.053530 |  Pulls it back.
[2041.00 - 2042.00] P:1602.86 E:0.062610 |  Oh, there's a chance of a shot now.
[2042.00 - 2046.00] P:1530.82 E:0.059208 |  No, Robin hits it, goalwards, but it bumped the foot of the check, and it's a simple take.
[2047.00 - 2048.00] P:1590.98 E:0.064813 |  Yeah, good play by Gomez.
[2048.00 - 2050.00] P:1517.65 E:0.068988 |  Hold it, play, play the man here as well,
[2050.00 - 2053.00] P:1607.65 E:0.063753 |  which was Muller got half a shot really on it,
[2053.00 - 2055.00] P:1589.41 E:0.061955 |  as much as they have him back to Robin.
[2055.00 - 2057.00] P:1554.39 E:0.048556 |  Left foot shot, easily saved by Czeck.
[2058.00 - 2061.00] P:1181.21 E:0.054271 |  But there's been nothing going the way of Noyer's goal.
[2061.00 - 2062.00] P:1379.50 E:0.062013 |  Nothing at all.
[2062.00 - 2064.00] P:1467.00 E:0.045157 |  Do you know what? He's probably on a two-stick twice.
[2065.00 - 2071.00] P:1271.67 E:0.047399 |  Well, he was a ball boy in a final, what, eight years ago, in Geltjenkirchen.
[2072.00 - 2075.00] P:1447.68 E:0.057699 |  Here he is playing, and he hardly touched the ball at all.
[2076.00 - 2079.00] P:1348.93 E:0.051355 |  Here's Kehel, over the halfway line for Chelsea.
[2079.00 - 2081.00] P:1509.09 E:0.058421 |  On to Kalu, back to Kehel.
[2081.00 - 2083.00] P:1391.74 E:0.066510 |  And Kehel goes down, tackled by Boateng.
[2083.00 - 2087.00] P:1496.75 E:0.066678 |  It's a foul tackled by Boateng, and here's a rare opportunity for Chelsea.
[2087.00 - 2090.00] P:1731.14 E:0.057790 |  I just sucked him in, didn't he? Very clever by Kehel, joining the attack.
[2090.00 - 2092.00] P:1471.86 E:0.056719 |  Little one-two went for the two as it were,
[2092.00 - 2097.00] P:1453.87 E:0.055024 |  and nicked it past Boateng, who'd already sort of made his decision to try and pitch the ball off him.
[2097.00 - 2101.00] P:1432.02 E:0.060122 |  Now, Matta has the ball in his hand, but surely this is drug but territory.
[2102.00 - 2103.00] P:1573.53 E:0.067375 |  He tried getting the ball off him.
[2103.00 - 2106.00] P:1274.67 E:0.060939 |  Well, Matta hasn't let him take the ball.
[2106.00 - 2109.00] P:1325.39 E:0.051717 |  Matta's placing it where he wants it.
[2110.00 - 2111.00] P:1780.27 E:0.048268 |  Did you see what Neuer did?
[2112.00 - 2113.00] P:1154.85 E:0.053895 |  No, I didn't.
[2113.00 - 2115.00] P:1514.57 E:0.057549 |  He got the ball, boy, to throw him the ball.
[2115.00 - 2119.00] P:1436.80 E:0.055778 |  Not the ball we're playing, but one behind the ball, just to have a touch of it before they take the free kick.
[2119.00 - 2121.00] P:1451.99 E:0.059836 |  I think it's practically the only touch he's had in the game.
[2121.00 - 2122.00] P:1375.40 E:0.053970 |  With his hand, certainly.
[2122.00 - 2126.00] P:1410.69 E:0.049296 |  Right, Matta and drug but are discussing options at the moment.
[2126.00 - 2130.00] P:1546.65 E:0.050048 |  Matta's still indicating that it's his free kick.
[2130.00 - 2133.00] P:1312.62 E:0.044839 |  It's meant for a left-footed shot.
[2133.00 - 2137.00] P:1428.03 E:0.045116 |  Drug was still there, though, only a foot away from the ball.
[2137.00 - 2141.00] P:1660.08 E:0.050689 |  If that, now he backs off 12 minutes to half-time.
[2141.00 - 2143.00] P:1719.57 E:0.049504 |  The first opportunity for Chelsea.
[2143.00 - 2145.00] P:1708.63 E:0.058719 |  Will it be Matta or will it be drug but?
[2145.00 - 2149.00] P:1805.12 E:0.061320 |  Referee makes sure the barn wall is back the full 10 yards.
[2151.00 - 2152.00] P:1814.04 E:0.045286 |  Now he waits.
[2152.00 - 2153.00] P:1693.63 E:0.070272 |  Drug but runs over the ball.
[2153.00 - 2154.00] P:1896.35 E:0.051290 |  Matta shoots.
[2154.00 - 2155.00] P:1400.41 E:0.066142 |  Oh, poor it.
[2155.00 - 2156.00] P:1226.67 E:0.058165 |  Over the crossbar.
[2156.00 - 2158.00] P:1641.26 E:0.059628 |  Yeah, William Shakespeare.
[2158.00 - 2160.00] P:1546.03 E:0.060972 |  Gotta make the goalkeeper do something.
[2160.00 - 2161.00] P:1792.26 E:0.045039 |  Nothing, yeah.
[2161.00 - 2164.00] P:1586.39 E:0.053358 |  At least make him a save, make him make a save.
[2164.00 - 2166.00] P:1396.72 E:0.050998 |  Especially when he hasn't had to make a save.
[2166.00 - 2169.00] P:1458.10 E:0.051581 |  He will be still nervous, no, yeah?
[2169.00 - 2170.00] P:1511.31 E:0.037847 |  We're nervous, and we're not playing.
[2170.00 - 2171.00] P:1343.08 E:0.057074 |  You are.
[2171.00 - 2172.00] P:1239.90 E:0.031915 |  I'm a bit worried.
[2172.00 - 2173.00] P:1480.13 E:0.056557 |  You're not a good job, you're not playing, innit?
[2173.00 - 2177.00] P:1333.33 E:0.050176 |  Well, I'm just wondering if I have to strike that clown with a green cap in front of me again.
[2177.00 - 2181.00] P:1295.66 E:0.048145 |  I notice he hasn't got up after the previous altercation.
[2181.00 - 2183.00] P:1170.98 E:0.047653 |  He's wised up the guy.
[2183.00 - 2185.00] P:1301.96 E:0.053403 |  Imagine standing up trying to take photographs.
[2185.00 - 2186.00] P:1199.38 E:0.049036 |  He's media.
[2187.00 - 2188.00] P:1106.74 E:0.044201 |  Here's Robin.
[2188.00 - 2190.00] P:1293.63 E:0.061686 |  Good work by Robin.
[2190.00 - 2191.00] P:1240.47 E:0.038926 |  Onto Gomez.
[2191.00 - 2192.00] P:1449.54 E:0.050400 |  Back to Robin.
[2192.00 - 2193.00] P:1252.36 E:0.072331 |  Well played, Arjen.
[2193.00 - 2194.00] P:1556.59 E:0.048329 |  Robin, feeding it to Contento.
[2194.00 - 2195.00] P:1688.54 E:0.058246 |  Ribbri's down the left.
[2195.00 - 2196.00] P:1686.11 E:0.070188 |  So to his, Robin.
[2196.00 - 2197.00] P:1701.52 E:0.040504 |  It's with Ribbri.
[2197.00 - 2199.00] P:1580.13 E:0.044148 |  To the left of the penalty here.
[2199.00 - 2200.00] P:1490.91 E:0.058869 |  Now moving in field.
[2200.00 - 2202.00] P:1435.86 E:0.055181 |  Into the box and shoots wide of goal.
[2202.00 - 2204.00] P:1623.68 E:0.047347 |  Now, I just dragged this shot.
[2204.00 - 2207.00] P:1844.92 E:0.054134 |  They seem to be able to create the opportunity and the space,
[2207.00 - 2213.00] P:1536.75 E:0.050531 |  but in terms of the shooting, I think Robin had a similar chance from the left-hand side.
[2213.00 - 2216.00] P:1403.51 E:0.052937 |  In terms of coming in from the left, from the right-hand side,
[2216.00 - 2220.00] P:1327.11 E:0.050119 |  and obviously then Ribbri, but neither unfortunately for Bayern Munich,
[2220.00 - 2221.00] P:1358.37 E:0.052035 |  might as to hit the target.
[2221.00 - 2225.00] P:1410.99 E:0.054463 |  Earlier in football, West Ham reclaimed their place in the Premier League
[2225.00 - 2228.00] P:1092.05 E:0.053600 |  by beating Blackpool 2-1 in the play-off at Wembley.
[2228.00 - 2231.00] P:1427.96 E:0.048855 |  Heartsbeat Hibbs 5-1 in the Scottish Cup final,
[2231.00 - 2236.00] P:1345.29 E:0.055618 |  and in the Heineken Cup final, Leinster 42, Oster 14.
[2236.00 - 2241.00] P:1111.57 E:0.059642 |  Contento for Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, here in Munich.
[2241.00 - 2243.00] P:1045.86 E:0.056774 |  On line to Ribbri.
[2243.00 - 2247.00] P:1124.11 E:0.052177 |  Ribbri, faced by Basinger, and taps it back to Contento.
[2247.00 - 2248.00] P:1393.93 E:0.059494 |  Contento crosses into the box.
[2248.00 - 2252.00] P:1443.76 E:0.062832 |  Here's a great chance for the shot, I think it hit a Chelsea player.
[2252.00 - 2255.00] P:1407.62 E:0.063154 |  Well, the referee looked, but no, he hasn't given the corner.
[2255.00 - 2256.00] P:1621.12 E:0.058568 |  It's a goal kick.
[2256.00 - 2257.00] P:1733.58 E:0.051114 |  Yeah, it was Buller.
[2257.00 - 2261.00] P:1577.51 E:0.053850 |  Heads of the penalty area, left foot on the volley.
[2261.00 - 2262.00] P:1745.50 E:0.059570 |  Good chance.
[2262.00 - 2264.00] P:1647.76 E:0.050018 |  Good chance, decent strike, but obviously not on time.
[2264.00 - 2267.00] P:1357.63 E:0.042901 |  No, he didn't hit a Chelsea player with that shot.
[2267.00 - 2270.00] P:1386.78 E:0.041225 |  Ashley Korn was closest to him.
[2270.00 - 2271.00] P:1160.69 E:0.044291 |  Worrying.
[2271.00 - 2277.00] P:1439.06 E:0.046592 |  All the chances are Bayerns inside the final 10 minutes of the first half.
[2277.00 - 2281.00] P:1530.80 E:0.050196 |  Miquel on to Matta, lovely touch by Matta,
[2281.00 - 2283.00] P:1452.22 E:0.058965 |  and now it's over the halfway line with Bersingua.
[2283.00 - 2286.00] P:1625.06 E:0.054443 |  Bersingua now checks, and it looks in field,
[2286.00 - 2288.00] P:1565.86 E:0.063270 |  flicks it in the direction of Lampard.
[2288.00 - 2292.00] P:1478.24 E:0.062207 |  Lampard on to Drogba, here's a chance for Dignit Drogba into the penalty area.
[2292.00 - 2294.00] P:1548.12 E:0.059544 |  The ball couldn't get down off his head quickly enough,
[2294.00 - 2297.00] P:1449.51 E:0.050683 |  and it's partially cleared by Bayern Munich.
[2297.00 - 2300.00] P:1378.34 E:0.046398 |  Bertrand, DeCole, back to Bertrand.
[2300.00 - 2303.00] P:1516.78 E:0.055942 |  A collision on the far side, referee, Eliza Brady continue.
[2303.00 - 2305.00] P:1348.11 E:0.054172 |  Chelsea still on the ball.
[2305.00 - 2308.00] P:1506.79 E:0.057482 |  Lampard back to Miquel, Drogba was so unlucky, just couldn't get the ball down.
[2308.00 - 2310.00] P:1682.01 E:0.049769 |  I think Lampard did brilliantly, you know, coming back, the right back,
[2310.00 - 2311.00] P:1654.70 E:0.041469 |  just to put him off.
[2311.00 - 2313.00] P:1619.34 E:0.048076 |  He has impinged it from him.
[2313.00 - 2316.00] P:1446.63 E:0.062497 |  Here's Kalu, running between two Bayern defenders,
[2316.00 - 2319.00] P:1597.37 E:0.053600 |  but then the ball didn't run kindy for him,
[2319.00 - 2322.00] P:1533.55 E:0.042473 |  and it's cleared by Bayern Munich.
[2322.00 - 2323.00] P:1341.92 E:0.031805 |  It's with...
[2323.00 - 2325.00] P:1414.45 E:0.041818 |  Is it Gomez on this side?
[2325.00 - 2327.00] P:1392.75 E:0.052417 |  How deep was Gomez there?
[2327.00 - 2330.00] P:1475.18 E:0.067784 |  Then he's tackled, lost the ball initially to Miquel,
[2330.00 - 2333.00] P:1493.35 E:0.058128 |  lost it a second time to Miquel, and Chelsea have it back.
[2333.00 - 2338.00] P:1395.69 E:0.060758 |  That's good play by Kalu, defined Lampard on to Mata.
[2338.00 - 2340.00] P:1433.44 E:0.057827 |  Bertrand available down the far side.
[2340.00 - 2342.00] P:1587.36 E:0.050938 |  Chelsea's best foul this last couple of minutes.
[2342.00 - 2345.00] P:1545.25 E:0.058231 |  Little cross in, Drogba back, here's the ball to Lampard,
[2345.00 - 2349.00] P:1384.12 E:0.070867 |  into Kalu, collusion, and the near post, well saved by Neuer.
[2349.00 - 2350.00] P:1476.69 E:0.068259 |  That was goal by...
[2350.00 - 2353.00] P:1723.23 E:0.064278 |  It was goal by, now, but it's an easy save by Neuer in the end,
[2353.00 - 2356.00] P:1692.53 E:0.059686 |  but it's encouragement from Chelsea's point of view.
[2356.00 - 2358.00] P:1647.97 E:0.054815 |  Very, very good break, and they kept the ball and moved it
[2358.00 - 2360.00] P:1403.93 E:0.041279 |  better and quicker this time.
[2360.00 - 2363.00] P:1393.51 E:0.055622 |  Far, far better, Steve, Bruce. What do you think, Steve?
[2363.00 - 2366.00] P:1492.52 E:0.057184 |  Well, last have got a foothold in the game, which is terrific to see.
[2366.00 - 2368.00] P:1610.90 E:0.063584 |  I think he's made the wrong choice there, Kalu.
[2368.00 - 2370.00] P:1567.10 E:0.064070 |  Maybe he should have gone a cross goal.
[2370.00 - 2371.00] P:1751.13 E:0.053291 |  I think it was better options on,
[2371.00 - 2373.00] P:1426.61 E:0.057061 |  but at least they've got a foot in the game.
[2373.00 - 2375.00] P:1518.30 E:0.061244 |  And once the string, two, three, four passes,
[2375.00 - 2378.00] P:1362.28 E:0.060550 |  I think Bayern Munich defensively are not that great.
[2378.00 - 2381.00] P:1545.28 E:0.057146 |  They're good in the ball, but certainly Cruz and Schweinsteiger
[2381.00 - 2383.00] P:1438.11 E:0.049107 |  have not had great defensively wise.
[2383.00 - 2384.00] P:1383.37 E:0.037623 |  Here is Schweinsteiger.
[2384.00 - 2386.00] P:1532.22 E:0.049057 |  They don't track to there at all.
[2386.00 - 2387.00] P:1063.92 E:0.032083 |  No.
[2387.00 - 2391.00] P:1260.82 E:0.050537 |  Schweinsteiger, too contentive, and on to Ribbri,
[2391.00 - 2393.00] P:1321.30 E:0.050635 |  a little burst of speed from Ribbri.
[2393.00 - 2394.00] P:1416.39 E:0.069810 |  Pass into Robin.
[2394.00 - 2397.00] P:1567.94 E:0.059953 |  Robin miscontrolled the ball, and it's taken away well by Cahill.
[2397.00 - 2398.00] P:1487.15 E:0.047168 |  Cahill, no.
[2398.00 - 2399.00] P:1528.34 E:0.047596 |  To Matta.
[2399.00 - 2401.00] P:1550.16 E:0.053944 |  Matta in space, down the right side.
[2401.00 - 2402.00] P:1569.37 E:0.060004 |  Cahill still running forward.
[2402.00 - 2404.00] P:1220.05 E:0.048537 |  Drug was already up there.
[2404.00 - 2405.00] P:1454.22 E:0.048566 |  On the far side, it's got Bertrand.
[2405.00 - 2408.00] P:1325.50 E:0.051627 |  The pass into the centre circle, though, and Lampard.
[2408.00 - 2411.00] P:1367.07 E:0.060276 |  Gershle called, clearly Chelsea's best ball in the game.
[2411.00 - 2413.00] P:1361.46 E:0.050741 |  These last five minutes, his flick pass,
[2413.00 - 2415.00] P:1378.28 E:0.056138 |  and not from under control by Bertrand,
[2415.00 - 2416.00] P:1714.53 E:0.044221 |  and it's behind for the goal.
[2416.00 - 2418.00] P:1789.60 E:0.059037 |  Yeah, just back to the bad old ways a little bit,
[2418.00 - 2420.00] P:1883.68 E:0.056953 |  where you want to force it.
[2420.00 - 2423.00] P:1829.71 E:0.045367 |  When you've no need to force it, just keep the ball.
[2423.00 - 2426.00] P:1439.75 E:0.050161 |  As you see that, you know, in terms of backpedalling,
[2426.00 - 2428.00] P:1440.59 E:0.061836 |  the two central midfield players are Bayern,
[2428.00 - 2429.00] P:1494.26 E:0.063414 |  aren't particularly good at it.
[2429.00 - 2433.00] P:1538.39 E:0.059805 |  They don't offer much protection to a back four already depleted.
[2433.00 - 2436.00] P:1234.41 E:0.049628 |  Gold kick was taken short by Neuer.
[2436.00 - 2438.00] P:1351.55 E:0.059373 |  And now they're just risking a little bit by Munich,
[2438.00 - 2440.00] P:1329.45 E:0.044069 |  deep in defence.
[2440.00 - 2444.00] P:1291.47 E:0.044621 |  Ten attempts by Bayern Munich.
[2444.00 - 2446.00] P:1488.47 E:0.050214 |  Just two by Chelsea.
[2446.00 - 2449.00] P:1474.18 E:0.052200 |  Yeah, but only two on target for Munich and one for Chelsea.
[2449.00 - 2451.00] P:1356.44 E:0.046836 |  That effort by Kalu.
[2451.00 - 2452.00] P:1602.04 E:0.057179 |  Here's Feinsteiger,
[2452.00 - 2454.00] P:1259.97 E:0.039526 |  flicking the ball to the right,
[2454.00 - 2456.00] P:1594.95 E:0.058702 |  and the cross by Cruz takes an affliction.
[2456.00 - 2458.00] P:1503.58 E:0.059858 |  Gomez inside the penalty here, overhead kick,
[2458.00 - 2460.00] P:1446.76 E:0.056514 |  ball rebounds over to Fender,
[2460.00 - 2462.00] P:1539.80 E:0.070315 |  Robin to Ribbery, Ribbery shot.
[2462.00 - 2464.00] P:1503.80 E:0.069198 |  Oh, my goodness, what an opportunity for Gomez.
[2464.00 - 2466.00] P:1596.73 E:0.063597 |  Why didn't he just shoot first time?
[2466.00 - 2468.00] P:1406.67 E:0.063283 |  He tried to bring the ball under control,
[2468.00 - 2469.00] P:1538.40 E:0.061254 |  and it's cleared by Chelsea.
[2469.00 - 2470.00] P:1674.83 E:0.065905 |  Yeah, I think it was one of those.
[2470.00 - 2472.00] P:1422.63 E:0.069563 |  He looked a little bit of a difficult ball to control
[2472.00 - 2475.00] P:1394.76 E:0.059141 |  when it first came over from Ribbery.
[2475.00 - 2477.00] P:1355.52 E:0.044939 |  And I think he just...
[2477.00 - 2479.00] P:1459.42 E:0.055589 |  Yeah, he's gone to have a first touch.
[2479.00 - 2481.00] P:1568.78 E:0.060908 |  It was an awkward height for him.
[2481.00 - 2484.00] P:1345.36 E:0.044046 |  Six minutes and a half time, corner to Bayern.
[2484.00 - 2486.00] P:1475.24 E:0.055410 |  Robin to take it, in front of the Chelsea fans.
[2486.00 - 2488.00] P:1383.42 E:0.049154 |  Plays it in deliberately deep,
[2488.00 - 2490.00] P:1386.90 E:0.064899 |  but it's far too deep actually.
[2490.00 - 2493.00] P:1399.26 E:0.056734 |  And as Feinsteiger, despite rushing back towards the touchline,
[2493.00 - 2495.00] P:1500.81 E:0.045326 |  can't keep it in play. What a waste.
[2495.00 - 2497.00] P:1286.62 E:0.030851 |  Yeah.
[2497.00 - 2498.00] P:1470.30 E:0.040930 |  It's funny, Gomez.
[2498.00 - 2500.00] P:1358.84 E:0.053359 |  I've seen him four or five times,
[2500.00 - 2503.00] P:1403.58 E:0.054483 |  and two or three of those times, he's looked ordinary.
[2503.00 - 2506.00] P:1232.96 E:0.053711 |  And the other two times, he's looked absolutely brilliant.
[2506.00 - 2508.00] P:1415.76 E:0.054723 |  And tonight at the moment, he looked ordinary.
[2508.00 - 2511.00] P:1426.32 E:0.048689 |  It's as if it's best for him not to think,
[2511.00 - 2513.00] P:1390.37 E:0.040641 |  because on a couple of occasions here,
[2513.00 - 2516.00] P:1512.40 E:0.059029 |  he's taken a first touch when you just hit it goal-wards.
[2516.00 - 2519.00] P:1730.32 E:0.046692 |  It might be like you, it might be nervous.
[2519.00 - 2521.00] P:1405.66 E:0.053469 |  Now, what happened there?
[2521.00 - 2524.00] P:1222.20 E:0.043360 |  Well, ticked off by the referee,
[2524.00 - 2526.00] P:1158.61 E:0.057575 |  and a free kick to Bayern,
[2526.00 - 2529.00] P:1227.32 E:0.063573 |  taken by Cruz.
[2529.00 - 2531.00] P:1514.09 E:0.073056 |  And now Tim Schuchat from long range,
[2531.00 - 2533.00] P:1221.89 E:0.057197 |  kicks a deflection of a Bayern player,
[2533.00 - 2534.00] P:1150.95 E:0.062642 |  and it's wide of goal.
[2534.00 - 2537.00] P:1531.21 E:0.048583 |  I think it was at Mullah, he tried to flick it on.
[2537.00 - 2539.00] P:1474.10 E:0.051266 |  And Cech was obviously going for the first one,
[2539.00 - 2541.00] P:1620.85 E:0.057577 |  and that's a scurry across his goal.
[2541.00 - 2543.00] P:1537.87 E:0.050339 |  Rolled footed him, but at least the deflection
[2543.00 - 2547.00] P:1432.07 E:0.043685 |  took the ball wide, and it's a goal kick for Chelsea.
[2547.00 - 2549.00] P:1331.68 E:0.061265 |  Five minutes to go to halftime.
[2549.00 - 2552.00] P:1371.41 E:0.054630 |  Chelsea nail, and you're listening to five-fly,
[2552.00 - 2557.00] P:1161.23 E:0.054491 |  BBC London, 94.9, and World Service on the BBC.
[2557.00 - 2560.00] P:1306.89 E:0.057038 |  Chelsea have been largely under the cosh,
[2560.00 - 2562.00] P:1469.85 E:0.039175 |  but they haven't conceded.
[2562.00 - 2564.00] P:1511.77 E:0.052965 |  That's the most important thing.
[2564.00 - 2566.00] P:1673.39 E:0.055759 |  The longer it goes, the more encouraging.
[2566.00 - 2570.00] P:1285.36 E:0.036172 |  Call with a throw, to Lampard,
[2570.00 - 2573.00] P:1205.42 E:0.051151 |  and back to Luis, and here's Cahill.
[2573.00 - 2576.00] P:1190.99 E:0.052551 |  And that other worry we had before kickoff
[2576.00 - 2578.00] P:1407.98 E:0.053183 |  about the fitness of the two central defenders,
[2578.00 - 2580.00] P:1530.16 E:0.057707 |  they seem fine, don't they?
[2580.00 - 2581.00] P:1451.42 E:0.056481 |  Absolutely fine.
[2581.00 - 2584.00] P:1557.01 E:0.062519 |  In training this week, they've done as much as they can
[2584.00 - 2587.00] P:1650.12 E:0.056254 |  with the pair of them to try and put them in a game situation
[2587.00 - 2590.00] P:1789.58 E:0.057929 |  just to make sure they were going to be OK.
[2590.00 - 2593.00] P:1593.24 E:0.055778 |  Luis for Chelsea, slashes the ball towards the left side,
[2593.00 - 2595.00] P:1629.84 E:0.054183 |  deliberately aimed towards Ashley Cole.
[2595.00 - 2598.00] P:1482.87 E:0.056771 |  Cole controlled it well, Cole's done very well.
[2598.00 - 2600.00] P:1381.40 E:0.044482 |  Can he find Bergen? No one's dead, it's Matta.
[2600.00 - 2603.00] P:1525.68 E:0.060288 |  Matta running in towards the penalty here, Matta still going.
[2603.00 - 2605.00] P:1302.79 E:0.061882 |  Oh, got the pass wrong, the drogba.
[2605.00 - 2608.00] P:1551.02 E:0.047717 |  It's cleared by Bayern Munich, and here's Cruz.
[2608.00 - 2611.00] P:1606.49 E:0.056130 |  Cruz, knight of referee, who pops up in the centre circle,
[2611.00 - 2613.00] P:1646.52 E:0.058103 |  but he didn't spot the run from Pusingua,
[2613.00 - 2615.00] P:1609.97 E:0.056440 |  Pusingua takes the ball off him,
[2615.00 - 2617.00] P:1520.36 E:0.052400 |  and now it's with Frank Lampard for Chelsea.
[2617.00 - 2620.00] P:1581.29 E:0.051267 |  Chelsea certainly far more in the game
[2620.00 - 2622.00] P:1651.51 E:0.035044 |  in this last ten minutes.
[2622.00 - 2625.00] P:1480.05 E:0.046029 |  Colou with Pusingua on the overlap,
[2625.00 - 2628.00] P:1520.84 E:0.045124 |  it's flicked towards Pusingua, right at the penalty area,
[2628.00 - 2631.00] P:1489.38 E:0.052846 |  the Bayern penalty area, played through the legs of a defender,
[2631.00 - 2635.00] P:1512.34 E:0.054888 |  and then it's cleared by Contento and Cruz.
[2635.00 - 2639.00] P:1570.14 E:0.051691 |  On now to Muller, Muller over the halfway line,
[2639.00 - 2641.00] P:1529.36 E:0.047789 |  right in the centre circle, gives it to Robert,
[2641.00 - 2643.00] P:1458.74 E:0.049574 |  down the right side, river is on the left,
[2643.00 - 2645.00] P:1504.99 E:0.056208 |  Robin moving in field, and it's fed through,
[2645.00 - 2647.00] P:1508.44 E:0.070758 |  Gomez, chance for Gomez,
[2647.00 - 2649.00] P:1586.58 E:0.071153 |  hits it over the crossbar, best chance in the game,
[2649.00 - 2651.00] P:1432.46 E:0.062741 |  and he messed it up.
[2651.00 - 2654.00] P:1543.94 E:0.065274 |  Well, the thing is Alan initially did absolutely brilliantly,
[2654.00 - 2657.00] P:1490.95 E:0.058398 |  because he kind of let the ball run and stepped over it at the same time,
[2657.00 - 2659.00] P:1575.32 E:0.054572 |  so it came on to his favour's left foot,
[2659.00 - 2662.00] P:1393.73 E:0.049296 |  and he's just hiked it over the crossbar.
[2664.00 - 2666.00] P:1401.54 E:0.055115 |  Bad, bad miss.
[2666.00 - 2668.00] P:1439.49 E:0.056479 |  Great chance as well, great chance.
[2668.00 - 2672.00] P:1367.75 E:0.056009 |  Lost an opportunity, and it was brilliantly created by Muller.
[2672.00 - 2675.00] P:1516.11 E:0.056371 |  Newpank is head in hands at that miss.
[2675.00 - 2678.00] P:1514.34 E:0.048804 |  On the break, it was a break, wasn't it?
[2678.00 - 2681.00] P:1573.25 E:0.051486 |  Check with a goal kick for Chelsea,
[2681.00 - 2684.00] P:1492.03 E:0.047311 |  two and a half minutes to go to half time.
[2684.00 - 2687.00] P:1437.84 E:0.052399 |  Seemed to be fouled by Drogba on Schreinsteiger,
[2687.00 - 2689.00] P:1397.22 E:0.049313 |  but he didn't matter as far as Barna concerned,
[2689.00 - 2691.00] P:1524.14 E:0.046973 |  because they had the ball.
[2691.00 - 2693.00] P:1343.41 E:0.047775 |  Lamb back to his goalkeeper, Neuer,
[2693.00 - 2696.00] P:1484.25 E:0.059193 |  Neuer plays it up over the half-way line immediately.
[2696.00 - 2699.00] P:1484.80 E:0.052638 |  Muller hates it just behind Gomez,
[2699.00 - 2701.00] P:1583.23 E:0.051471 |  I think Muller's played really well.
[2701.00 - 2703.00] P:1555.33 E:0.060416 |  Considering he starts too early for Barna really.
[2703.00 - 2706.00] P:1440.39 E:0.044410 |  I think he understands the space in terms of, you know,
[2706.00 - 2709.00] P:1434.09 E:0.037437 |  when to run into it, when to stay out of it.
[2709.00 - 2711.00] P:1373.08 E:0.059943 |  Oh, dear.
[2711.00 - 2714.00] P:1219.86 E:0.048240 |  I hope we don't have to face him in the summer in Ukraine.
[2714.00 - 2716.00] P:1399.07 E:0.048617 |  Here's Bo-Tang.
[2716.00 - 2718.00] P:1274.89 E:0.046669 |  No, probably not.
[2718.00 - 2720.00] P:1307.78 E:0.052596 |  I'd rather he wasn't in the German side.
[2720.00 - 2724.00] P:1441.68 E:0.045994 |  Here's Krose to Schreinsteiger, who will be in the team.
[2724.00 - 2727.00] P:1555.89 E:0.056142 |  Onto Krose, Krose, then sort of muscled out of it by Kalu.
[2727.00 - 2729.00] P:1469.70 E:0.049707 |  Good play by Chelsea.
[2729.00 - 2731.00] P:1457.16 E:0.053856 |  Kalu on now to Lampard.
[2731.00 - 2733.00] P:1292.50 E:0.054188 |  Lampard to the left side and Bertrand.
[2733.00 - 2735.00] P:1210.37 E:0.055277 |  Lampard was fouled there by Ribbry.
[2735.00 - 2736.00] P:1166.95 E:0.050910 |  Referee played good advantage.
[2736.00 - 2738.00] P:1277.60 E:0.044181 |  Referee's doing really well here.
[2738.00 - 2740.00] P:1257.65 E:0.054849 |  Not holding things up unnecessarily.
[2740.00 - 2744.00] P:1343.60 E:0.051202 |  Lampard again to McKen.
[2744.00 - 2746.00] P:1572.28 E:0.059094 |  Bertrand on the far side of the field.
[2746.00 - 2748.00] P:1635.74 E:0.059541 |  Look how far upfield Ashley Cole is.
[2748.00 - 2750.00] P:1754.81 E:0.052222 |  Fast goes backwards though, initially.
[2750.00 - 2752.00] P:1330.69 E:0.063812 |  To Matta. And now Lampard.
[2752.00 - 2754.00] P:1199.02 E:0.056643 |  A minute and a half left in the first half.
[2754.00 - 2757.00] P:1317.04 E:0.056029 |  Matta to Lampard, who's Tackle and the ball squirts out of play
[2757.00 - 2759.00] P:1550.87 E:0.050772 |  for a throw into Chelsea.
[2759.00 - 2762.00] P:1449.06 E:0.046838 |  Good tackle by Tim Issue, actually.
[2762.00 - 2765.00] P:1270.10 E:0.063897 |  Throwing to be taken by Ashley Cole.
[2765.00 - 2768.00] P:1271.47 E:0.049406 |  We've seen much more of Chelsea as an attacking force
[2768.00 - 2771.00] P:1183.39 E:0.048164 |  in the recent quarter of an hour.
[2771.00 - 2774.00] P:1128.67 E:0.062524 |  And now it goes back to Louise.
[2774.00 - 2777.00] P:1477.12 E:0.060559 |  Alan, since Chelsea have come forward a little bit more,
[2777.00 - 2779.00] P:1435.16 E:0.051215 |  Bayern don't look anything like the team
[2779.00 - 2781.00] P:1447.43 E:0.053543 |  in the possession of the ball all the time.
[2781.00 - 2783.00] P:1446.89 E:0.068383 |  Here's Bertrand down to the left side.
[2783.00 - 2785.00] P:1336.17 E:0.054120 |  Bertrand falls over. Was he fouled?
[2785.00 - 2787.00] P:1624.60 E:0.045826 |  No, Bertrand was the one doing the fouling.
[2787.00 - 2790.00] P:1743.04 E:0.044648 |  And it's a free kick to Bayern Munich in the final mid-to-the-first half.
[2790.00 - 2792.00] P:1744.55 E:0.051262 |  Yeah, I just think it's very important.
[2792.00 - 2794.00] P:1441.83 E:0.046394 |  You're going at half time, you're 0-0.
[2794.00 - 2797.00] P:1465.74 E:0.054681 |  And I think, you know, Tim Matta has to be very, very positive with them.
[2797.00 - 2799.00] P:1552.89 E:0.054769 |  Keep the ball better defensively as well.
[2799.00 - 2802.00] P:1686.77 E:0.049598 |  But when you get the opportunity to build up with the ball,
[2802.00 - 2804.00] P:1537.79 E:0.056694 |  they're going to create themselves some chances.
[2804.00 - 2809.00] P:1373.04 E:0.051327 |  Here's Cruz over the halfway line, playing it to the left to content on to Ribri.
[2809.00 - 2812.00] P:1453.84 E:0.049711 |  I think he's been a bit of a disappointment so far, Ribri.
[2812.00 - 2816.00] P:1715.25 E:0.059476 |  I think he tried to go around Basingua on the outside very early.
[2816.00 - 2819.00] P:1591.59 E:0.047076 |  Basingua got back easily, and he's not tried it since.
[2819.00 - 2821.00] P:1651.33 E:0.046358 |  He just keeps cutting inside.
[2821.00 - 2824.00] P:1395.40 E:0.054004 |  Schweinsteiger heading it towards the right side on Muller.
[2824.00 - 2826.00] P:1602.42 E:0.053913 |  Gomez is inside the penalty here.
[2826.00 - 2828.00] P:1432.18 E:0.055074 |  And he's headed in to Ribri.
[2828.00 - 2830.00] P:1544.68 E:0.059622 |  Ribri now on his left foot.
[2830.00 - 2833.00] P:1713.82 E:0.053175 |  Luis takes the ball off him, and Chelsea clear that carefully.
[2833.00 - 2835.00] P:1636.03 E:0.059616 |  Well, he just stood up, Luis, and he said,
[2835.00 - 2837.00] P:1589.29 E:0.048136 |  come on, you're going to have to beat me in the end.
[2837.00 - 2839.00] P:1580.91 E:0.061357 |  He's pinched the ball off his toes.
[2839.00 - 2841.00] P:1304.49 E:0.040595 |  One minute of added time at the end of this first half.
[2841.00 - 2843.00] P:1355.35 E:0.058039 |  We're into it.
[2843.00 - 2845.00] P:1448.99 E:0.055575 |  Cahill, back to Luis, don't do anything daft.
[2845.00 - 2847.00] P:1372.87 E:0.041477 |  And back now to Czech.
[2847.00 - 2849.00] P:1701.25 E:0.059500 |  Oh, there's the Tanoian answer.
[2849.00 - 2851.00] P:1530.99 E:0.035313 |  It's the greatest night of his life.
[2851.00 - 2854.00] P:1733.67 E:0.058421 |  He's blasting his voice all across the world.
[2854.00 - 2856.00] P:1775.81 E:0.040106 |  And he's the only son you're talking about.
[2856.00 - 2859.00] P:1710.87 E:0.031109 |  You'll be getting letters.
[2859.00 - 2861.00] P:1604.64 E:0.049982 |  And the fellow you knocked out in front of us as well.
[2861.00 - 2864.00] P:1432.59 E:0.037923 |  I wonder what the third one's going to be.
[2864.00 - 2867.00] P:1057.74 E:0.038180 |  I'll find one. I'll deal with him.
[2867.00 - 2871.00] P:1241.93 E:0.050581 |  Schweinsteiger, Proband Munich, inside his own half.
[2871.00 - 2873.00] P:1243.89 E:0.062684 |  To Boathe.
[2873.00 - 2875.00] P:1237.29 E:0.062444 |  And on to Ribri. Good ball by Ribri.
[2875.00 - 2877.00] P:1465.63 E:0.056599 |  Into Muller. Well tackled by Miquel.
[2877.00 - 2879.00] P:1402.55 E:0.050299 |  Miquel's playing really well for Chelsea tonight.
[2879.00 - 2881.00] P:1366.63 E:0.056725 |  Miquel again from Basingua's pass.
[2881.00 - 2883.00] P:1252.83 E:0.047769 |  On to Matta. Back to Miquel.
[2883.00 - 2885.00] P:1048.34 E:0.050055 |  Miquel holds off Cruz.
[2885.00 - 2887.00] P:1390.38 E:0.050689 |  And then the ball goes out of play off Cruz.
[2887.00 - 2889.00] P:1677.75 E:0.049946 |  It's going to be a throw in to Chelsea.
[2889.00 - 2891.00] P:1795.87 E:0.067095 |  And then Chelsea are growing into this game.
[2891.00 - 2893.00] P:1738.61 E:0.039153 |  Which is the key at the moment.
[2893.00 - 2898.00] P:1380.09 E:0.045238 |  Well, it has taken Nil Nil at the start of the first half at half time.
[2898.00 - 2900.00] P:1383.64 E:0.035263 |  Definitely taken Nil Nil.
[2900.00 - 2902.00] P:1705.34 E:0.047888 |  And that is half time.
[2902.00 - 2904.00] P:1771.97 E:0.068582 |  What do you think, Mark?
[2904.00 - 2906.00] P:1787.13 E:0.059223 |  Well, I think that, you know, Chelsea would be delighted it's Nil Nil.
[2906.00 - 2910.00] P:1716.81 E:0.056254 |  And as to say, you know, they accentuate the positives at half time with the Dimmato.
[2910.00 - 2912.00] P:1778.19 E:0.051689 |  What we must say, of course, is Chelsea
[2912.00 - 2916.00] P:1714.57 E:0.049927 |  in check he's made a really good save with his sweep which came off the crossbar.
[2916.00 - 2919.00] P:1601.20 E:0.046886 |  But in all honesty, Gomez should have put Bayern in front.
[2919.00 - 2921.00] P:1737.56 E:0.058831 |  Muller had a very, very good chance as well.
[2921.00 - 2924.00] P:1745.41 E:0.057959 |  They've held on a little bit, but in the last 10 or 15 minutes
[2924.00 - 2926.00] P:1688.86 E:0.056728 |  they've started to grow into the game
[2926.00 - 2929.00] P:1574.42 E:0.047370 |  and starting to show a little bit more belief.
[2929.00 - 2934.00] P:1409.15 E:0.050360 |  The guy in the green cap has stood up at the half time interval
[2934.00 - 2936.00] P:1700.56 E:0.063272 |  but he's immediately making his way out.
[2936.00 - 2939.00] P:1856.32 E:0.060009 |  He knows, he's got to stay out of my way.
[2939.00 - 2943.00] P:1601.51 E:0.052172 |  And certainly when the games in motion sit down, son, are you going to be trouble?
[2943.00 - 2945.00] P:1691.67 E:0.056419 |  He's not coming back here, by the way.
[2945.00 - 2946.00] P:1355.76 E:0.047911 |  Half time, Nil Nil Mark.
[2946.00 - 2949.00] P:1928.20 E:0.056708 |  So, Steve Bruce, from a Chelsea point of view
[2949.00 - 2952.00] P:1916.87 E:0.053171 |  they just edged their way into the game as it went on.
[2952.00 - 2955.00] P:1833.74 E:0.054281 |  Well, I think we spoke about it last night in detail, didn't we, that?
[2955.00 - 2959.00] P:1680.63 E:0.052646 |  In my opinion, with the way it is, we're actually playing, you know,
[2959.00 - 2961.00] P:1692.16 E:0.052753 |  it's a home game for Bayern Munich, if the truth be known.
[2961.00 - 2964.00] P:1705.14 E:0.055226 |  So we knew that it's going to be difficult to start with.
[2964.00 - 2968.00] P:1707.31 E:0.052155 |  And for 20-25 minutes, let's be fair, they were on the back foot.
[2968.00 - 2971.00] P:1629.03 E:0.050539 |  They've dug in defensively, they've been sound.
[2971.00 - 2974.00] P:1580.56 E:0.050362 |  Czech has made a decent save, there's been one outstanding chance
[2974.00 - 2976.00] P:1790.39 E:0.049248 |  and Gomez has placed it over the bar.
[2976.00 - 2979.00] P:1646.72 E:0.045616 |  I would like to see Chelsea now, if they possibly can,
[2979.00 - 2982.00] P:1786.07 E:0.057520 |  try and insert themselves, because as soon as they have,
[2982.00 - 2984.00] P:1731.53 E:0.044008 |  a little bit of possession of the ball.
[2984.00 - 2987.00] P:1730.39 E:0.059860 |  Defensively, the Bayern Munich team are not that great,
[2987.00 - 2990.00] P:1776.21 E:0.056490 |  even though Chelsea have not made the keeper, made a save yet
[2990.00 - 2992.00] P:1767.98 E:0.051332 |  and I don't think he's touched the ball with his hands.
[2992.00 - 2994.00] P:1713.56 E:0.062725 |  But there must be a little bit more positive.
[2994.00 - 2997.00] P:1774.24 E:0.050008 |  First 15-20 minutes is going to be vital.
[2997.00 - 2999.00] P:1748.07 E:0.052696 |  And let's hope Chelsea can get a break.
[2999.00 - 3001.00] P:2061.67 E:0.070132 |  But as Mark said, the great chance to go,
[3001.00 - 3003.00] P:1978.02 E:0.060997 |  when Chelsea came, when Chelsea were attacking
[3003.00 - 3006.00] P:1924.34 E:0.059710 |  and suddenly there was a bit of space for Bayern Munich to exploit.
[3006.00 - 3009.00] P:1579.25 E:0.047929 |  Yes, I mean, they're quite regimented in what they do.
[3009.00 - 3012.00] P:1618.32 E:0.060861 |  We all knew what Bayern are, you know,
[3012.00 - 3015.00] P:1433.37 E:0.062271 |  Robin plays down the rest, the right here,
[3015.00 - 3018.00] P:1691.88 E:0.058279 |  the river is down the left, they're very regimented.
[3018.00 - 3020.00] P:1795.20 E:0.061686 |  Just a little slight change for me would be,
[3020.00 - 3022.00] P:1760.38 E:0.049856 |  can Matta get back on Swinsteiger?
[3022.00 - 3025.00] P:1796.74 E:0.054446 |  Everything goes from Swinsteiger, who's the deepest midfielder,
[3025.00 - 3029.00] P:1763.08 E:0.057626 |  I would like to see Matta 5-10 yards closer to him, possibly.
[3029.00 - 3033.00] P:1791.98 E:0.055942 |  And let one of the two central halves start the attacks for them.
[3033.00 - 3036.00] P:1788.73 E:0.055840 |  And then, as I said, Chelsea have grown into the game.
[3036.00 - 3038.00] P:1710.25 E:0.059623 |  We know they've got players like Torres on the bench
[3038.00 - 3041.00] P:1826.67 E:0.046780 |  who can come on and might make that difference.
[3041.00 - 3043.00] P:2110.51 E:0.071395 |  And Mark said it, there are times when Gomez looks like
[3043.00 - 3045.00] P:1955.45 E:0.065051 |  the greatest natural goal scorer of all times.
[3045.00 - 3047.00] P:1947.82 E:0.056001 |  And there are other nights like tonight when he hesitated,
[3047.00 - 3050.00] P:2042.28 E:0.063348 |  tried to do a little drag back when he just needed to shoot.
[3050.00 - 3052.00] P:1912.34 E:0.057182 |  And then the chance at the end where he actually,
[3052.00 - 3055.00] P:1995.34 E:0.061675 |  and you sort of rather groaned, he shook off Gary Cahill
[3055.00 - 3057.00] P:2053.69 E:0.067019 |  very easily, didn't he, to shoot over the top?
[3057.00 - 3061.00] P:1827.59 E:0.060416 |  Yeah, Gary Cahill dived in a little bit, which is obviously Gary,
[3061.00 - 3063.00] P:1720.10 E:0.055012 |  you know, he's playing for Bolton this time of year ago,
[3063.00 - 3067.00] P:1879.66 E:0.051330 |  he's had a meteoric rise to the top, he's just dived in,
[3067.00 - 3070.00] P:1678.09 E:0.061358 |  committed himself, and that's left an opening for him,
[3070.00 - 3072.00] P:2000.15 E:0.051347 |  and thankfully for him, Hanford Chelsea Gomez has
[3072.00 - 3074.00] P:1915.26 E:0.065795 |  just hit it over the bar. And you're right, he's one of them,
[3074.00 - 3077.00] P:1974.83 E:0.060243 |  he's in and out as I say, you know, he can be on his day,
[3077.00 - 3081.00] P:1860.55 E:0.050740 |  a fantastic pair, let's not hope we're putting the kiss of death
[3081.00 - 3084.00] P:1964.57 E:0.057539 |  on Chelsea in that, it's going to be Gomez's night.
[3084.00 - 3086.00] P:2013.37 E:0.068330 |  Chelsea, we've got a half-time then at nil, nil,
[3086.00 - 3088.00] P:2013.02 E:0.060985 |  let's go out into town, out into Munich,
[3088.00 - 3090.00] P:1921.85 E:0.057333 |  and join our reporter, John Bennett.
[3090.00 - 3093.00] P:1553.32 E:0.067000 |  Yes, well over a thousand Bayern fans packed into this
[3093.00 - 3096.00] P:1877.46 E:0.076168 |  beer garden in northern Munich, Mark,
[3096.00 - 3099.00] P:1854.25 E:0.063448 |  and Chelsea succeeded in doing one thing already in this final,
[3099.00 - 3103.00] P:1813.10 E:0.066953 |  silence the fans here, great atmosphere for the first ten minutes
[3103.00 - 3106.00] P:1991.22 E:0.058662 |  of the match, but then with Chelsea frustrating the German side,
[3106.00 - 3109.00] P:1790.99 E:0.058417 |  it became very tense and nervous, there's silence at the moment
[3109.00 - 3113.00] P:1619.39 E:0.062732 |  as we speak, Michael is a Bayern fan, he's wearing his replica shirt,
[3113.00 - 3116.00] P:1560.47 E:0.052694 |  Michael, how are you feeling after that first half?
[3116.00 - 3120.00] P:1862.23 E:0.054944 |  I'm feeling very confident, I think it's a sure win for Bayern,
[3120.00 - 3126.00] P:1482.62 E:0.043314 |  and I don't think Chelsea will take it, so I think it will be
[3126.00 - 3128.00] P:1516.02 E:0.065124 |  a two-zero for sure.
[3128.00 - 3130.00] P:1674.68 E:0.062976 |  You're not nervous though, Bayern are missing a lot of chances.
[3130.00 - 3135.00] P:1740.48 E:0.060357 |  A little bit, but I think Chelsea didn't have a very clear chance,
[3135.00 - 3137.00] P:1378.75 E:0.047465 |  so Bayern will take it in the end.
[3137.00 - 3141.00] P:1659.02 E:0.060781 |  What do you make of Chelsea, a few boos for some of their players,
[3141.00 - 3145.00] P:1413.67 E:0.065092 |  from the fans here at the beer garden, some boos for Roman Abramovich
[3145.00 - 3149.00] P:1533.96 E:0.044554 |  when his face pops on the big screen, what do you make of their tactics?
[3149.00 - 3153.00] P:1724.67 E:0.061678 |  I don't think Chelsea has very strong tactics, it's under defence,
[3153.00 - 3158.00] P:1597.04 E:0.050858 |  and to try to counter us, but in the end we will succeed and take it home.
[3158.00 - 3161.00] P:1513.41 E:0.054844 |  Who will be the man to win it for Bayern, do you think, finally?
[3161.00 - 3162.00] P:1738.48 E:0.058443 |  I hope it's Robin.
[3162.00 - 3167.00] P:1576.21 E:0.057766 |  They're still confident here, but I can really feel the tension
[3167.00 - 3170.00] P:1596.70 E:0.056970 |  and the nerves around the beer garden here in Northern Munich.
[3170.00 - 3173.00] P:1889.94 E:0.047034 |  Thank you very much indeed for that, John, we've just seen the stats
[3173.00 - 3177.00] P:2005.68 E:0.055566 |  from the first half in terms of possession, and Bayern Munich had
[3177.00 - 3182.00] P:2084.36 E:0.053055 |  60% possession there, so just 40% for Chelsea, just quickly, Steve Bruce.
[3182.00 - 3186.00] P:2080.39 E:0.063393 |  They won in Barcelona with a lot less than 40%, it was more like 30%.
[3186.00 - 3190.00] P:1920.15 E:0.051014 |  Absolutely, you would expect Bayern Munich to have the large majority of possession,
[3190.00 - 3194.00] P:1960.16 E:0.050014 |  we understand that, and you're right, in Barcelona they had 20% in the whole game
[3194.00 - 3200.00] P:1863.28 E:0.049763 |  and come away winning the game, so that stat is worrying of course,
[3200.00 - 3204.00] P:1903.83 E:0.050104 |  but the big stat for Chelsea at this particular moment is zero goals,
[3204.00 - 3208.00] P:1887.98 E:0.047367 |  and as I said from the start of this match, let's hope that in the second half
[3208.00 - 3212.00] P:1914.67 E:0.050243 |  Chelsea can come stronger, certainly in the last 10 minutes they've looked better
[3212.00 - 3215.00] P:1870.74 E:0.048469 |  and more of a threat going forward, let's hope they can keep that up
[3215.00 - 3218.00] P:1728.16 E:0.055719 |  and keep the ball better and provide that threat.
[3218.00 - 3221.00] P:2122.68 E:0.064691 |  0-0 halftime here in the Allianz Arena in the Champions League final
[3221.00 - 3226.00] P:2031.20 E:0.060715 |  between Chelsea and Bayern Munich. This weekend, well, it's time for

[3295.00 - 3300.00] P:1811.57 E:0.058077 |  growth in reviving the global economy and urged Greece to remain in the single currency.
[3300.00 - 3304.00] P:1808.07 E:0.061956 |  A statement issued at Camp David said a strong and cohesive eurozone was important
[3304.00 - 3306.00] P:1453.44 E:0.057628 |  for global economic stability.
[3306.00 - 3310.00] P:2074.19 E:0.044690 |  Jonathan Portes is from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
[3310.00 - 3315.00] P:1360.10 E:0.053007 |  The mood has definitely shifted as political leaders have realised that austerity,
[3315.00 - 3320.00] P:1210.02 E:0.047633 |  particularly in the eurozone, is politically unsustainable and economically
[3320.00 - 3322.00] P:964.71 E:0.049059 |  not delivering the results.
[3322.00 - 3326.00] P:1255.05 E:0.047625 |  This has the potential to be the most important international summit in a couple of years,
[3326.00 - 3328.00] P:1180.51 E:0.051719 |  so hopes are high.

[3360.00 - 3363.00] P:1085.38 E:0.061121 |  It's because the lorry was on fire on the side of the motorway and all traffic had to be stopped
[3363.00 - 3365.00] P:1589.92 E:0.061216 |  so the fire brigade could get through.
[3365.00 - 3370.00] P:1161.99 E:0.060213 |  Two lanes are still closed there southbound at 32, but traffic is now able to pass in lane 3.

[3385.00 - 3388.00] P:1590.84 E:0.060442 |  I reckon that's about as plummet as they come these days.

[3420.00 - 3423.00] P:2017.48 E:0.070736 |  And it's goalless at half-time, so let's look at the other sport today.
[3423.00 - 3429.00] P:1988.08 E:0.062301 |  And West Ham have returned to the Premier League at the first time of asking after they won the championship playoff this afternoon.
[3429.00 - 3434.00] P:1816.72 E:0.060628 |  A Ricardo Vasate goal three minutes from time, saw them beat Blackpool 2-1.
[3434.00 - 3438.00] P:1877.93 E:0.052367 |  Carlton Cole earlier put the hammers in front before Tom Ince equalised,
[3438.00 - 3441.00] P:1850.04 E:0.063493 |  only for Vasate to grab the glory at the end.
[3441.00 - 3444.00] P:1746.51 E:0.055339 |  And here's the West Ham manager Sam Allardice.
[3444.00 - 3450.00] P:1258.63 E:0.065411 |  We've been waiting for a winning goal in the last five minutes all season and one at a time together, you know.
[3450.00 - 3454.00] P:1310.33 E:0.059586 |  Vasate again, brought him in January.
[3454.00 - 3458.00] P:1253.09 E:0.062785 |  And he's one of the reasons why we're where we are today and where we're going next season.
[3458.00 - 3461.00] P:1598.81 E:0.047060 |  In Scotland the All-Enever Cup final went the way of hearts.
[3461.00 - 3464.00] P:1825.22 E:0.055020 |  They hammered Hibbs 5-1 at Hamden.
[3464.00 - 3468.00] P:1792.58 E:0.053885 |  It's the eighth time that hearts have won it the first time since 2006.
[3468.00 - 3472.00] P:1854.04 E:0.063016 |  England's cricketers have taken charge of the first test against the West Indies at Lauds.
[3472.00 - 3481.00] P:1863.07 E:0.056276 |  The visitors lost three wickets without scoring a run in ten deliveries just before T, Barat, Paule and Edwards all out with a score on 36.
[3481.00 - 3485.00] P:1821.31 E:0.056108 |  By the close they were 120 for four, still 35 behind England.
[3485.00 - 3492.00] P:1879.80 E:0.056319 |  Lenster are rugby unions, European champions for the third time in four seasons following a win over Ulstra at Twickenham.
[3492.00 - 3498.00] P:1861.57 E:0.054763 |  They won 42-14 and the semi-final line-up is completed at Golfs World Match playing Spain.
[3498.00 - 3504.00] P:1638.57 E:0.057359 |  Graham McDowell will face Rafael Cabrera-Bello while Paul Lory plays Nicholas Coleserts.
[3504.00 - 3515.00] P:1749.39 E:0.053772 |  Right, Rafa Nadal soon to the final of the row, Masters tennis to play either Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer who are playing their semi-final now and Lee James can update us.
[3515.00 - 3521.00] P:1857.39 E:0.059632 |  And Roger Federer is still alive in this match mark but only Chas Novak Djokovic has been in the ascendancy from the start
[3521.00 - 3525.00] P:1897.15 E:0.052987 |  in a one-sided contest, he won the first set six games to two.
[3525.00 - 3533.00] P:1828.96 E:0.052158 |  Federer appeared to be heading for the exit but he's come to life when match point down he kept himself in contention with a four-hand winner.
[3533.00 - 3535.00] P:1737.38 E:0.045013 |  We're now into a tie break in the second set.
[3535.00 - 3543.00] P:1695.26 E:0.048066 |  Thanks for that Lee and in racing, Frankel made it ten wins from ten as he took victory in the lock-in stakes at Newbury.
[3543.00 - 3550.00] P:1738.42 E:0.059941 |  So another win for Frankel, just going to ask Steve Bruce about Ryan Bertrand who we flagged up as having the most amazing ten months or so
[3550.00 - 3554.00] P:1740.71 E:0.059489 |  from Chelsea reserve to the Champions League final, he's barely touch the ball.
[3554.00 - 3555.00] P:1685.21 E:0.060422 |  But actually how has he done?
[3555.00 - 3557.00] P:1660.72 E:0.068242 |  If that doesn't sound a sort of rather contrary question.
[3557.00 - 3561.00] P:1840.11 E:0.054056 |  Yeah, I mean, let's be fair, Chelsea and as a team haven't had great possession.
[3561.00 - 3564.00] P:1852.86 E:0.066005 |  But you can see why Demeterre Wise picked him.
[3564.00 - 3571.00] P:1847.68 E:0.053759 |  I mean, the big strength, the right back alarm must be as good a fullback as there is in the world, let alone in Europe.
[3571.00 - 3575.00] P:1911.58 E:0.055979 |  And of course, you know, he links fantastically down there, there right-hand side.
[3575.00 - 3579.00] P:1841.06 E:0.040198 |  And that's what he's done. The kids are threatening. He's got up and down the pitch.
[3579.00 - 3581.00] P:1862.04 E:0.050440 |  He's helped Ashley Cole enormously.
[3581.00 - 3584.00] P:1908.30 E:0.050337 |  In fact, that hasn't been much of a threat.
[3584.00 - 3594.00] P:1769.82 E:0.058224 |  You know, they haven't been really tested down there as such because the young kid defensively has got himself back in an area where he's not let Ashley Cole be exposed.
[3594.00 - 3597.00] P:1754.95 E:0.061658 |  And he's done very, very well. I'd like to see him in a more tack.
[3597.00 - 3602.00] P:1801.13 E:0.045030 |  Has he got that little bit of trick or that can he produce a cross? What can win you a game?
[3602.00 - 3604.00] P:1591.61 E:0.043990 |  We'll have to wait and see until the second half.
[3604.00 - 3610.00] P:1895.17 E:0.067197 |  Milnell at half-time here in Munich, back at home, the Olympic torch relay around Britain is reaching the end of the first day.
[3610.00 - 3616.00] P:2051.13 E:0.061565 |  John Kay has been following it for us from Lansend early this morning. So where have you ended up this evening, John?
[3616.00 - 3622.00] P:1702.28 E:0.060633 |  We're in Plymouth, just approaching the centre of Plymouth for a big final celebration at the end of day one.
[3622.00 - 3630.00] P:1712.46 E:0.065847 |  I tell you what, you would never know there was a big football match on tonight in Plymouth because it feels like the entire city has come out.
[3630.00 - 3634.00] P:1608.61 E:0.057395 |  I've seen people piling out of pubs as the flame has gone past.
[3634.00 - 3639.00] P:1680.65 E:0.061525 |  He's seen him in a wedding party in the last few minutes coming out of their reception to join in.
[3639.00 - 3652.00] P:1734.06 E:0.060327 |  Tens of thousands of people across Cornwall are now into Devon today and the most recent torch bearer just a couple of minutes ago was the BBC's legendary sports commentator, Olympic opening ceremony commentator, Barry Davis.
[3652.00 - 3656.00] P:1635.63 E:0.055607 |  Big smile from him, but I suspect he's now going to go and watch the match.
[3656.00 - 3663.00] P:1813.22 E:0.065528 |  I should think he is. He will love that, Barry Davis. He will absolutely love that. Great to hear that he's been part of that relay.
[3663.00 - 3666.00] P:1872.23 E:0.050247 |  Back here in Munich, no goals, plenty of chances.
[3669.00 - 3677.00] P:1481.77 E:0.069275 |  Gomez with a chance. Chelsea have to be careful here. Oh, Miss Kick from Basingua should have cleared it and it's a corner and Chelsea at 6-07.
[3677.00 - 3685.00] P:1285.18 E:0.072138 |  Chelsea as Robin plays a 1-2 and Robin in the end, Onderskott that in, checks, somehow makes a save and it's cleared for a corner kick.
[3685.00 - 3690.00] P:1442.74 E:0.062317 |  Robin's strike, he's fighting his thumbs at the moment, wondering how that didn't go in.
[3690.00 - 3696.00] P:1407.51 E:0.072433 |  Robin to Ribbry, Ribbry shot. Oh my goodness, what an opportunity for Gomez. Why did he just shoot first time?
[3696.00 - 3699.00] P:1314.81 E:0.069913 |  He tried to bring the ball under control and it's cleared by Chelsea.
[3699.00 - 3703.00] P:1337.82 E:0.071738 |  Galo's shot and the near post, well saved by Moyer. That was goal by Gomez.
[3703.00 - 3708.00] P:1388.21 E:0.074826 |  Chance for Gomez, Hicksal over the crossbar, best chance in the game and he messed it up.
[3709.00 - 3719.00] P:1734.70 E:0.080561 |  Saying earlier that the Allianz Arena can change colour, it is still predominantly white but with sort of turquoise and green and blue at the bottom of it.
[3719.00 - 3723.00] P:1760.07 E:0.059017 |  From the outside, Steve, it looks sensational, doesn't it? And from the inside as well for that matter.
[3723.00 - 3729.00] P:1694.73 E:0.049114 |  Well, both, it's absolutely sensational stadium. I mean, the trend changes colour, it's quite incredible.
[3729.00 - 3736.00] P:1668.49 E:0.056987 |  It reminds me actually of the Bullring in Birmingham City centre. I don't have anybody seen it from the outside.
[3736.00 - 3740.00] P:2047.65 E:0.070404 |  Oh yes, I know exactly what you mean. Yes, there's sort of studded effects on the outside there.
[3740.00 - 3748.00] P:1878.59 E:0.052307 |  I'd say it's just a wonderful, wonderful place to play football. And the German fans, they really do it fantastically well.
[3748.00 - 3756.00] P:1851.22 E:0.054866 |  We were talking just before, the average German fan here pays 120 euros for a season ticket to come to a stadium like this.
[3756.00 - 3761.00] P:1922.91 E:0.053614 |  It's quite remarkable and just shows you how they look after the average supporter in this country.
[3761.00 - 3767.00] P:1993.58 E:0.065849 |  There's so much they've got right about German football, but are they going to have the Champions League or is it coming to the Premier League at the end of this?
[3767.00 - 3776.00] P:1913.15 E:0.058715 |  The lines are open for Alan 606, 0500, 999, 693, the text number is 85058, Chelsea reappearing for the second half.
[3776.00 - 3780.00] P:1740.01 E:0.057252 |  Here come the red of Bayern Munich as well and here's Mike Ingham to pick up the story.
[3782.00 - 3785.00] P:1641.62 E:0.060640 |  Well, the best thing about this stadium, I think, is the fact that there's no running track.
[3785.00 - 3794.00] P:1473.89 E:0.051483 |  That was the problem with the old Olympic stadium. The crowd are right on top of the pitch here, so the stats from the first half were 60-40 to Bayern possession.
[3794.00 - 3802.00] P:1391.45 E:0.055761 |  They had eight corners and Chelsea had none, but it's still 0-0. We've got something I'd never like to see actually in the stadiums.
[3802.00 - 3809.00] P:1472.84 E:0.050856 |  Red flares up on the top tier away to the right and they need to get those extinguished as quickly as possible.
[3809.00 - 3815.00] P:1437.75 E:0.047151 |  Certainly a hazard and dangerous and goodness knows how they managed to get them in the first place.
[3815.00 - 3818.00] P:1319.69 E:0.049478 |  Bearing in mind you can't even bring bottles of water in from outside.
[3818.00 - 3829.00] P:1643.68 E:0.058074 |  Anyway, here are the line-ups for the second half. Bayern with Neuer in goal, Laam, Botang, Timershulken, Contento, Schweinsteiger and Kruss, Robin, Muller, Ribbery and Gomez.
[3829.00 - 3834.00] P:1686.48 E:0.055173 |  The Chelsea line-up and Chelsea in this second half play from right to left with check in goal.
[3834.00 - 3843.00] P:1395.68 E:0.048427 |  Bersingwer, Luis, Cahill and Cole, Mikhail, who I thought was outstanding and lampard, Kalu, Matta, Bertrand and Drogba.
[3843.00 - 3854.00] P:1384.46 E:0.047094 |  The closest really to a goal was when Robin's shot was saved by Czech's feet and came off the bar, but also Gomez, of course, Mr. Sitter.
[3854.00 - 3862.00] P:1378.72 E:0.049876 |  So, do we have here the last 45 minutes of the European club season or are we going to have an extra 30 and maybe even penalties?
[3862.00 - 3864.00] P:1259.66 E:0.044224 |  What are some early thoughts from Mark Lawrence?
[3864.00 - 3868.00] P:1508.88 E:0.053424 |  Well, I think it's just important that Chelsea start the second half positively, Mike.
[3868.00 - 3874.00] P:1483.34 E:0.049541 |  I thought they ended the second half much brighter than the first, sort of half an hour and the mines are in their attack now.
[3874.00 - 3881.00] P:1585.39 E:0.064597 |  Here comes Ribbery for the first time. Going forward for Bayern Munich, Kail trying to force him wide and Luis is there to scramble the ball away.
[3881.00 - 3886.00] P:1659.91 E:0.053077 |  And it went kindly for Chelsea because it actually hit Ribbery and so it's going to be a goal kick.
[3886.00 - 3895.00] P:1580.07 E:0.047149 |  That's the first time that Ribbery's had a chance to run it virtually the last defender in the penalty area and he went past Kail rather easily and should have done better.
[3895.00 - 3907.00] P:1685.32 E:0.053328 |  The smoke from those flares now billowing across the stadium and the television cameras are picking out the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich for the first time here tonight.
[3907.00 - 3916.00] P:1473.06 E:0.053592 |  This, of course, very much his holy grail. Nine seasons he's tried to win this competition so close in Moscow.
[3916.00 - 3920.00] P:1562.45 E:0.057765 |  And by the way, conditions completely different from Moscow. We had torrential rain in Moscow.
[3920.00 - 3930.00] P:1453.44 E:0.052560 |  Here it's a perfect evening after a perfect day and Bayern Munich wants more start with the ball but Müller misplaces the pass behind Ribbery and Chelsea as Mark Lawrence has been saying.
[3930.00 - 3939.00] P:1363.66 E:0.056011 |  Really have to start the second half well. No lapses of concentration as Miquel now receives following the throw over on the far side.
[3939.00 - 3949.00] P:1373.27 E:0.053681 |  Chelsea building from the back. You're listening to Five Live, BBC London 94.9 and World Service from the Champions League final.
[3949.00 - 3958.00] P:1459.13 E:0.052343 |  0-0 here. Despite the fact that Bayern had most of the game, it's still 0-0 and Drogber is battling down below us now with Timershaw.
[3958.00 - 3966.00] P:1526.04 E:0.059827 |  Played the ball in field and was scrambled back well by Bertrand and Miquel. Good crisp pass by him to Matta who spreads it wide now to Bersingua.
[3966.00 - 3973.00] P:1374.86 E:0.051226 |  That was good from Chelsea. Only Drogber at the moment in the penalty area and they have to settle for throwing over on the far side.
[3973.00 - 3980.00] P:1491.02 E:0.050463 |  Bersingua will take it and now he can throw the ball long Bersingua but it doesn't look like he's going to do it this time.
[3980.00 - 3987.00] P:1504.59 E:0.053319 |  Throws it to Matta who bends the ball into the centre circle and now it's David Louise. Louise finding Cole.
[3987.00 - 3997.00] P:1537.63 E:0.061536 |  Cole up against Robin, his former teammate. In fact it was five years ago today when Robin played his last game for Chelsea in the Cup final and Louise misjudges that and Robin's going forward.
[3997.00 - 4009.00] P:1586.59 E:0.054682 |  Great scrambling challenge from Ashley Cole to help out Chelsea. Still Robin has possibilities here. Plays the ball back to Kruse. Kruse's shot is lifted behind off the Chelsea player for a corner.
[4009.00 - 4016.00] P:1612.17 E:0.057296 |  Well I mean Louise has the intent to do that. He did one in the first half where he died in for a tackle and then he completely sold himself.
[4016.00 - 4021.00] P:1613.39 E:0.049450 |  Fortunately for him and for his team. Ashley Cole managed to get the block in.
[4021.00 - 4028.00] P:1561.75 E:0.054486 |  Robin still has fantastic pace and energy and he takes a short corner and he finds Laam and Robin's available now with a better angle perhaps.
[4028.00 - 4032.00] P:1395.81 E:0.049699 |  Boateng's gone forward headed out of the penalty area though by Chelsea.
[4032.00 - 4039.00] P:1374.34 E:0.062841 |  Robin's left it for Laam who plays it beautifully back to Timershaw and Bayern build again down this near side though.
[4039.00 - 4048.00] P:1387.21 E:0.059991 |  Rebury's calling for it over on the far side. The ball is with the danger man Robin. Robin's ball into Rebury so it couldn't have been him calling for it over on the far side.
[4048.00 - 4054.00] P:1318.47 E:0.057720 |  Rebury now and the ball played in and Chelsea have to be careful here. It was Laam who played it into the penalty area.
[4054.00 - 4066.00] P:1434.67 E:0.057409 |  Chelsea looking to try and counter attack. Colou in to Matta who does well to find Lampard and now Lampard played it long looking for the pace of Colou but Schweinsteiger actually in the left back position is there covering
[4066.00 - 4076.00] P:1674.97 E:0.060169 |  and Schweinsteiger pulls forward now for Bayern Munich. Schweinsteiger on to Rebury down the Bayern Munich left. Nil Nil here. Rebury on the edge of the penalty area.
[4076.00 - 4083.00] P:1459.56 E:0.052721 |  All the Chelsea players coming back. It's Thomas Muller now for Bayern Munich. Muller thinking about the shot perhaps.
[4083.00 - 4088.00] P:1521.67 E:0.056982 |  Miquel slips and the ball is tinked into the penalty area and the ever reliable check is there.
[4088.00 - 4096.00] P:1691.01 E:0.048015 |  Yeah it's a good break certainly by Bayern set up by the goalkeeper. Nile had the first touch into Schweinsteiger broke very quickly but should have done better with it Muller.
[4096.00 - 4104.00] P:1502.10 E:0.053691 |  Just have to hold the ball better Chelsea. I think we've been making that point especially Steve Bruce making the point that when they do have the opportunity to play some football
[4104.00 - 4108.00] P:1345.28 E:0.061981 |  they don't really need to be giving it straight back to Bayern Munich.
[4108.00 - 4115.00] P:1512.39 E:0.063931 |  Over on that occasion Matt they were right to try and play Colou in. It would have been similar to the goal Ramirez scored against Barcelona away from home.
[4115.00 - 4122.00] P:1325.84 E:0.060221 |  And they must know and Roberto Di Matteo must know that if they can have some moments they can trouble this Bayern defence.
[4122.00 - 4128.00] P:1517.09 E:0.067055 |  There's no question about that. Throw into Chelsea. Droggler with his great bow. Tries a shot there from 30 yards or so.
[4128.00 - 4136.00] P:1501.46 E:0.061102 |  And I don't know why Timershoek is screaming at the referee. It's gone wide but it was Droggler's very best confident there but just spanking it wide.
[4136.00 - 4144.00] P:1546.38 E:0.058304 |  Well he just rolled Timershoek didn't he with his strength. Completely rolled him on the volley. A decent dip in strike as well.
[4144.00 - 4150.00] P:1518.04 E:0.066353 |  Just as noisy as it was at the start of the game. Still waiting. We thought there were going to be goals here in this game.
[4150.00 - 4157.00] P:1357.60 E:0.061473 |  We still may have them but it's Nile Nile here as Muller gets a bang on the head and Miquel plays it very delicately down the right hand side.
[4157.00 - 4163.00] P:1451.84 E:0.060871 |  And now Bersinghu has got some space down that right for Chelsea. Can he use it? Droggler's on the edge of the penalty area.
[4163.00 - 4168.00] P:1417.40 E:0.055543 |  Still Bersinghu partially tackled and winning a throw in off Schreinstein.
[4168.00 - 4175.00] P:1354.99 E:0.058945 |  Chelsea now got players in the penalty area and Bersinghu throws the ball down, throws the ball back to Miquel.
[4175.00 - 4183.00] P:1488.58 E:0.057949 |  Miquel under instruction from Cahill, knocks it a long way back to Louise and Chelsea start from inside their own half and Louise will get this back to Jack once more.
[4183.00 - 4190.00] P:1703.13 E:0.052372 |  Chelsea just calming things down here in this fever pitch atmosphere here in Bavaria.
[4190.00 - 4198.00] P:1606.86 E:0.055830 |  Still Nile Nile in the Champions League final, ball back with Czech in the goal away to our right and we've already played six minutes of the second half.
[4198.00 - 4206.00] P:1338.40 E:0.052089 |  Czech now feeding Cahill and Cahill and Louise both seem to be fine after their injury problems.
[4206.00 - 4211.00] P:1225.03 E:0.057184 |  Now Matta, who had some good moments but wasted a free kick in the first half.
[4211.00 - 4217.00] P:1216.37 E:0.057017 |  Kalu now back to Lampard who's been playing with great discipline Lampard, hardly wasting a pass as well when he's had it.
[4217.00 - 4226.00] P:1533.31 E:0.060209 |  Now Louise, Inter-Drogba, who tried to turn away from Timishuk once more, by and when it back again and now a lovely touch from Ribery, filters the ball down the left towards Muller.
[4226.00 - 4232.00] P:1654.81 E:0.064857 |  Cahill sweeps across though and does really well to find Kalu and the game just opening up a little bit here now.
[4232.00 - 4236.00] P:1518.03 E:0.056713 |  Kalu plays it square to Miquel and Miquel down the left hand side.
[4236.00 - 4244.00] P:1478.97 E:0.063267 |  Ashley Cole didn't run for it and Bayern have it and Lawn has it and Lawn is going forward at great pace here for Bayern Munich.
[4244.00 - 4253.00] P:1455.93 E:0.056847 |  The ball, Bbobbles throw, Cole has to be careful, Gomez throws himself down and it's going to be a goal kick but that was a complete misunderstanding down there
[4253.00 - 4256.00] P:1564.78 E:0.056316 |  and there are just a few words being spoken between Miquel and Ashley Cole.
[4256.00 - 4262.00] P:1737.73 E:0.056595 |  In all honesty, Ashley Cole, if he'd gone for it, Miquel would have got it easily. He decided not to go for it and in the end though,
[4262.00 - 4266.00] P:1300.97 E:0.050467 |  he managed to rectify the problem from Chelsea's point of view with the block.
[4266.00 - 4273.00] P:1322.10 E:0.055972 |  Well, here again from Steve Bruce in a couple of minutes as we move towards 7.5 minutes gone in the second half here.
[4273.00 - 4280.00] P:1447.94 E:0.054716 |  Still 0-0, Drogba now going to try and flick on this long clearance to Matta but Bayern Munich have it and Kruse,
[4280.00 - 4287.00] P:1571.01 E:0.064066 |  who really has had his style cramped a little bit here tonight, hasn't been able to get forward and Bayern Munich give the ball away really carelessly.
[4287.00 - 4294.00] P:1446.48 E:0.063327 |  Matta now finds Lampard, Lampard on the edge of the area, didn't have a shot but Bayern Munich give it straight back to Degas Drogba
[4294.00 - 4300.00] P:1478.65 E:0.063868 |  and there you have it really in a nutshell but when Bayern Munich are put under pressure, they can look vulnerable
[4300.00 - 4306.00] P:1413.23 E:0.062309 |  but now they go forward once more with Muller down the left hand side. Now Chelsea have to be careful.
[4306.00 - 4314.00] P:1541.86 E:0.070837 |  Muller for Bayern to Robin, Robin shoots and it's offside, it's in the back of the net from Ribery but it's offside and Chelsea survive.
[4314.00 - 4320.00] P:1480.38 E:0.071217 |  Well, they've got away with one, they really seriously have, it was a good block from Robin's shot I think.
[4320.00 - 4326.00] P:1431.84 E:0.064698 |  In the end it just did come back to Ribery, it was a decent block. Oh, it's tight mate.
[4326.00 - 4331.00] P:1470.92 E:0.067849 |  And the ball was played, it was really, really tight, really tight.
[4332.00 - 4341.00] P:1494.49 E:0.062628 |  And all of that happened, Bayern Munich nearly scoring within seconds of their own defence looking to have troubles at the other end of the field.
[4341.00 - 4344.00] P:1484.60 E:0.064430 |  Well, a drug per shot was blocked and they were away, weren't they?
[4344.00 - 4351.00] P:1552.35 E:0.069237 |  It's now contento, the left back of Bayern Munich, that's got the crowd going again. Gomez makes a rum but the ball is shorter to Muller,
[4351.00 - 4356.00] P:1592.21 E:0.063102 |  the Chelsea defenders back off, Robin's available down the near side but Bertram will cut it out
[4356.00 - 4365.00] P:1481.74 E:0.052444 |  and now Ashley Cole on the edge of the penalty area, bides his time and still bides his time and Lampard gives it back to Louise
[4365.00 - 4376.00] P:1576.95 E:0.055327 |  and Louise for Czech and Czech cleared it very hurriedly there towards this near side to Bertram and it's been headed out by Laam for a Chelsea throw.
[4376.00 - 4377.00] P:1659.61 E:0.066846 |  Quick word from Steve Bruce, Steve.
[4377.00 - 4383.00] P:1661.59 E:0.055672 |  Well, you can obviously see when Chelsea have got possession and they've got up into the final third now, the quick list of the break on Bayern Munich,
[4383.00 - 4388.00] P:1501.45 E:0.061278 |  that's once or twice now, the game's opened up far more than they ever did in the first 45 minutes
[4388.00 - 4396.00] P:1501.76 E:0.065475 |  and Chelsea have obviously got to be careful on the break because Bayern Munich with their three forward players will certainly enjoy that extra room which they're given at the moment.
[4396.00 - 4405.00] P:1469.62 E:0.066969 |  Still anybody's cut though here, 0-0 and Chelsea now try to spread the play down this near side to Bertram and Neuer who's hardly had a touch.
[4405.00 - 4417.00] P:1539.52 E:0.061832 |  In fact, Mark Lawrence was saying when he had to face a free kick from Matta towards the end the first half, he even got the ball boy to throw a ball at him so he could actually feel the ball.
[4417.00 - 4426.00] P:1445.56 E:0.054577 |  The ball never went out of the area there and it's been spotted by the officials and so they'll have to start that one all over again.
[4426.00 - 4437.00] P:1226.99 E:0.054064 |  Neuer then in the Bayern Munich goal to clear for them with just over 10 minutes gone in the second half on five live BBC London, 94.9 and World Service.
[4437.00 - 4447.00] P:1423.92 E:0.059549 |  Now it's into the Chelsea half, Louise Bayern Munich's Muller is it? I think holding his head and he's won himself the free kick that he was after all the way there.
[4447.00 - 4454.00] P:1470.39 E:0.043265 |  I think Louise sort of clambored and climbed all over and maybe caught him with an errant arm.
[4454.00 - 4462.00] P:1249.65 E:0.056967 |  And so are Jan Robin. Whenever he scores in this stadium Bayern Munich always win, that's his record. He hasn't scored yet this evening.
[4462.00 - 4472.00] P:1282.41 E:0.061881 |  He's been the closest to a Bayern goal so far and now he's lining up a free kick. They've only got two players forward, Gomez and Muller, two very good headers of the ball.
[4472.00 - 4479.00] P:1509.88 E:0.060501 |  Rieberi again optimistically calling for it and it's been taken short and Schweinsteiger now finds Kruse and it may go to Rieberi.
[4479.00 - 4487.00] P:1560.36 E:0.050019 |  Shot driven in and that's wasted from Bayern Munich. That was very selfish in the end really and that's gone wide for a goal kick for Chelsea.
[4487.00 - 4494.00] P:1477.38 E:0.051827 |  Yeah it was a waste and I think from Chelsea's point of view they all backed into the penalty area waiting for the cross and they just let Bayern Munich have the ball.
[4494.00 - 4496.00] P:1407.27 E:0.045185 |  That was from Kruse the shot wasn't it?
[4496.00 - 4506.00] P:1360.50 E:0.055134 |  And the thing is the longer this game goes there will still be Fernando Torres time I think in this final. At some point we're bound to see him and well you never know.
[4506.00 - 4510.00] P:1415.57 E:0.047775 |  He might have to surgically remove the track suit bottoms though.
[4510.00 - 4518.00] P:1131.66 E:0.057842 |  He's bound to play a part at some point and of course he played a massive part in Barcelona in that second leg semi-final.
[4518.00 - 4525.00] P:1411.30 E:0.066016 |  So Bayern Munich so far are being frustrated. They are the home side, they are getting more of the ball.
[4525.00 - 4534.00] P:1383.94 E:0.060044 |  But Chelsea just as they did in the semi-final are working really tirelessly here. Will they be able to keep it up?
[4534.00 - 4541.00] P:1472.28 E:0.054959 |  Neuer out of the penalty area for Timershuk and Lawn makes himself available down the right.
[4541.00 - 4548.00] P:1567.53 E:0.064097 |  Timershuk moves very coolly around the place and then he gave it straight to Michele who finds Matta. Can Chelsea counter attack here?
[4548.00 - 4556.00] P:1444.74 E:0.061777 |  Matta went around Kruse and was fouled by Kruse and to be honest for me that's a yellow card because he knew exactly what he was doing.
[4556.00 - 4562.00] P:1465.16 E:0.054978 |  Clever foul mate, clever foul. You're right about the yellow. Very clever foul because he just completely halted the break.
[4562.00 - 4568.00] P:1375.63 E:0.060945 |  Well he knew exactly what he was about there Kruse but the referee reluctant to produce cards in the final.
[4568.00 - 4576.00] P:1513.50 E:0.062214 |  He produced the one when he had no other alternative for deliberate handball. Now Ashley Cole for Chelsea looking for Drogba headed up in the air by Contento.
[4576.00 - 4584.00] P:1367.86 E:0.057639 |  Not very well as the whistle gone he sees it has as Kalu tries to bounce and it's going to be a free kick to Bayern Munich quickly taking Chelsea up to concentrate.
[4584.00 - 4591.00] P:1229.15 E:0.058439 |  They find Kruse on the edge of the penalty area. Kruse now bringing the ball out slowly and we played nearly 30 minutes of the second half.
[4591.00 - 4598.00] P:1384.41 E:0.063100 |  It's still 0-0. Robin and Ribery so far haven't changed flanks in the second half. Ribery very much down the left hand side.
[4598.00 - 4604.00] P:1454.47 E:0.055604 |  Then Bersingwer did well though to cut it out and then Michele who's having one of his best games for Chelsea.
[4604.00 - 4611.00] P:1300.28 E:0.054886 |  Finding Cole and now Lampard. 0-0. Lampard back to Cahill. Chelsea looking quite assured.
[4611.00 - 4616.00] P:1226.66 E:0.050532 |  Ball with Bersingwer the right back and Bersingwer knocks it long and that's poor.
[4616.00 - 4620.00] P:1375.44 E:0.054335 |  That's exactly what we've been talking about. Need to protect the ball better than that.
[4620.00 - 4625.00] P:1428.70 E:0.066174 |  Bayern, well I thought they'd let Chelsea in there but referee's penalised Chelsea.
[4625.00 - 4629.00] P:1645.60 E:0.049636 |  Yeah, high foot. It was Kalu.
[4629.00 - 4637.00] P:1606.27 E:0.050118 |  When he's had his moments, Drogba has shown of course that he is a menace and now Laam near side of the field.
[4637.00 - 4642.00] P:1276.68 E:0.055085 |  Laam in field to the unmarked Kruse. Chelsea perhaps need to be just a bit tighter on him.
[4642.00 - 4646.00] P:1401.56 E:0.059486 |  Now it goes to Muller down the right hand side. Gomez waits in the penalty area.
[4646.00 - 4651.00] P:1314.80 E:0.060264 |  Ball is played short though. They do like to build up. Don't normally hit long balls.
[4651.00 - 4656.00] P:1460.70 E:0.060184 |  Now it's Muller once more for Bayern. 1-2's towards Robin. Chelsea have to be careful.
[4656.00 - 4660.00] P:1494.99 E:0.063518 |  The dangerous Gomez is there. They haven't cleared it. Goes to Robin. Fantastic defending.
[4660.00 - 4664.00] P:1544.05 E:0.058767 |  I think it was Ashley Cole. Chelsea still have to get this ball out of the penalty area.
[4664.00 - 4669.00] P:1587.54 E:0.053832 |  Lampard jumping with Schweinsteiger and they're desperate for this to go out of play and eventually it does
[4669.00 - 4673.00] P:1752.24 E:0.056802 |  and somebody I think it was Cole throwing something there. Absolutely brilliant block.
[4673.00 - 4678.00] P:1647.74 E:0.050991 |  Broke to Robin, middle of the goal, pulled a left foot back, bang, Cole was there like a flash.
[4678.00 - 4682.00] P:1151.37 E:0.050755 |  We're going to get a replay of that mark and you can just...
[4682.00 - 4685.00] P:1241.84 E:0.066022 |  Yeah, Ashley Cole. That's absolutely great.
[4685.00 - 4693.00] P:1420.97 E:0.063946 |  And he was described yesterday by the way by Didier Drogba. Of course he is biased but he was described as the best left back in Europe.
[4693.00 - 4697.00] P:1500.73 E:0.057083 |  Well, I don't think there'd be too many disagreements about that.
[4697.00 - 4701.00] P:1487.94 E:0.053990 |  There's a lad who plays so Bayern could play left back and be the best in Europe as well.
[4701.00 - 4706.00] P:1662.12 E:0.059615 |  You're talking about arm, yeah. But he is now playing most of his football right back, but nevertheless...
[4706.00 - 4709.00] P:1320.54 E:0.037464 |  Is he? Yeah. The ball...
[4709.00 - 4715.00] P:1404.62 E:0.048394 |  Now Matta. Matta for Chelsea. Matta's ball into Kalu on the edge of the penalty area.
[4715.00 - 4720.00] P:1512.42 E:0.052257 |  Nice touch from Kalu. Basingwer now helps out. Basingwer has to be careful not to lose this
[4720.00 - 4724.00] P:1611.71 E:0.052270 |  because Bayern Munich could counterattack. Matta spots the danger though and plays it back.
[4724.00 - 4730.00] P:1472.73 E:0.051915 |  Chelsea are playing quite brightly in spells here. It's Matta once more now towards Drogba.
[4730.00 - 4735.00] P:1614.29 E:0.060036 |  Cushion clearance by Boateng and now this is when Bayern can be dangerous when they bring the ball out
[4735.00 - 4738.00] P:1499.95 E:0.043339 |  and Chelsea have to get numbers back in midfield.
[4738.00 - 4741.00] P:1521.16 E:0.060497 |  Kruis runs a long way with the ball and finds Rieberi down the left.
[4741.00 - 4745.00] P:1633.63 E:0.048405 |  It's still 0-0 in the Champions League final. Now it's Schweinsteiger.
[4745.00 - 4748.00] P:1506.32 E:0.051648 |  Schweinsteiger 15 yards inside the Chelsea half.
[4748.00 - 4753.00] P:1615.62 E:0.055132 |  Plays the ball down this near side, down the right to Muller who's won himself a corner off Ashley Cole.
[4753.00 - 4758.00] P:1767.06 E:0.062423 |  Yeah, you could just see there when Chelsea came forward. All of a sudden they had five players
[4758.00 - 4763.00] P:1681.40 E:0.056857 |  the wrong side of the ball which is something that Bayern very much like to try and do, hit you on the break.
[4763.00 - 4770.00] P:1491.10 E:0.060007 |  Chelsea still haven't had a corner. This one's short from Bayern Munich and it's been headed behind by Dillier Drogba for another corner.
[4770.00 - 4775.00] P:1515.17 E:0.052305 |  Drogba of course is always very useful coming back for these set pieces
[4775.00 - 4780.00] P:1310.64 E:0.055861 |  and now Robin prepares to take another Bayern Munich corner. Boateng's made a run into the penalty area.
[4780.00 - 4784.00] P:1448.32 E:0.059704 |  This time they do deliver long and it's been headed away to the far side.
[4784.00 - 4789.00] P:1451.35 E:0.052835 |  This time it was a Bayern player and so it's a goal kick for Chelsea. Still 0-0.
[4789.00 - 4794.00] P:1564.52 E:0.063643 |  Yeah, it was Schweinsteiger with the last two. He looked as though he jumped just in from to Gomez.
[4794.00 - 4798.00] P:1537.75 E:0.060503 |  Gomez was in a better position maybe in terms of the header.
[4798.00 - 4801.00] P:1593.72 E:0.060168 |  Important player of the game now for Chelsea mightness.
[4801.00 - 4806.00] P:1650.49 E:0.055447 |  Chelsea fans more subdued at the moment than the Bayern fans.
[4806.00 - 4813.00] P:1458.24 E:0.059716 |  Relentless applause away to our right. See a red down there and now check clears into the Bayern half.
[4813.00 - 4822.00] P:1201.23 E:0.056091 |  Drogba's going to try and chest this ball back. Lampard was there reacting and Kay Hill and Louise together have the ball
[4822.00 - 4830.00] P:1399.98 E:0.064892 |  and now so does Ashley Cole in field to Lampard leading well the side tonight. Lampard and Miquel looking very solid in midfield.
[4830.00 - 4836.00] P:1418.63 E:0.060881 |  The ball down the Chelsea right now the Chelsea fans we can hear responding to the Bayern supporters.
[4836.00 - 4842.00] P:1290.39 E:0.060513 |  Check takes possession once more away to our right and Louise now picks it up from him.
[4842.00 - 4848.00] P:1305.64 E:0.057580 |  Drogba points, Louise hits it long trying to lift it over Larm. Bertrand made a challenge.
[4848.00 - 4855.00] P:1434.18 E:0.062309 |  Bayern Munich are quick and Bayern Munich now move towards the half-way line and Gomez sends the ball back to Schweinsteiger
[4855.00 - 4860.00] P:1634.79 E:0.062439 |  and here's a chance for Bayern Schweinsteiger straight at Pedecek and his handling was brilliant.
[4860.00 - 4867.00] P:1554.37 E:0.061975 |  Well got his angles wrong, Schweinsteiger great break. Another five yards further sort of left towards us as you well away from checking.
[4867.00 - 4869.00] P:1499.09 E:0.060774 |  It was a great opportunity for Bayern.
[4869.00 - 4872.00] P:1346.86 E:0.057033 |  It's a much better second half. It is really opening up again now.
[4872.00 - 4878.00] P:1409.32 E:0.061232 |  Matter over on that far side for Chelsea surrounded though by red shirts and between them they win the ball back
[4878.00 - 4884.00] P:1548.28 E:0.063446 |  and it's Frank Ribere and Bersingua backs off and Robin goes on the outside and Ribere is charging towards the penalty area
[4884.00 - 4888.00] P:1373.94 E:0.066515 |  and still Frank Ribere and Ribere in the end try to set it up for Muller
[4888.00 - 4893.00] P:1530.65 E:0.055304 |  and Chelsea have the defenders back to clear and Cole finds Bertrand and Cole's gone for the return.
[4893.00 - 4896.00] P:1498.13 E:0.058910 |  Drogba holds and nuts it on to Ashley Cole.
[4896.00 - 4901.00] P:1625.30 E:0.054969 |  Cole though got a challenge from Bastian Schweinsteiger. He's now out of position.
[4901.00 - 4907.00] P:1616.26 E:0.052439 |  Bertrand will have to cover for him as Larm takes possession for Bayern Munich in field to Kruse.
[4907.00 - 4913.00] P:1540.04 E:0.054483 |  High ball to the far side. Robin now is playing down the left-hand side. Bersingua just backing off.
[4913.00 - 4917.00] P:1379.62 E:0.049011 |  Robin approaches the penalty area. The ball is flicked back into midfield.
[4917.00 - 4923.00] P:1586.34 E:0.056739 |  Chelsea got everybody back now behind the ball. Ribere trying to shape the shoot and he does and he drags it wide.
[4923.00 - 4925.00] P:1838.74 E:0.035541 |  And here's Mark.
[4925.00 - 4929.00] P:1689.04 E:0.066570 |  You know what? I don't know why he didn't shoot the time before. He had loads of space.
[4929.00 - 4934.00] P:1574.46 E:0.057529 |  He injured himself half a yard, headed the penalty area, just coming in from the left-hand side
[4934.00 - 4937.00] P:1372.57 E:0.063169 |  and he decided to try and play Gomez in. Have a shot.
[4937.00 - 4940.00] P:1481.09 E:0.054476 |  Let's have another word from Steve Bruce. Steve.
[4940.00 - 4945.00] P:1506.29 E:0.058929 |  Well, it's a far more open game in the second half as everybody can obviously see and we can see from here.
[4945.00 - 4950.00] P:1458.85 E:0.059664 |  And obviously Chelsea now in the next ten minutes is a vital, vital stage of it.
[4950.00 - 4954.00] P:1475.15 E:0.050758 |  Can they keep the ball and cause the threat? Because it's there for them.
[4954.00 - 4958.00] P:1694.44 E:0.055560 |  It's there for them if they can just reach their other little gear, which they're sure they've got.
[4958.00 - 4961.00] P:1477.43 E:0.050561 |  Yeah, it's almost a three-quarter mark in the 90 minutes.
[4961.00 - 4965.00] P:1481.84 E:0.051151 |  But of course the longer this goes, we may have an extra 30 for you.
[4965.00 - 4969.00] P:1541.48 E:0.049205 |  And it's going to be a Bayern Munich free kick.
[4969.00 - 4973.00] P:1501.40 E:0.058595 |  Despite their possession, they haven't been able to get a stranglehold of the game here.
[4973.00 - 4976.00] P:1520.87 E:0.050388 |  Gomez missing a great chance before the break.
[4976.00 - 4981.00] P:1370.82 E:0.051475 |  Robin having his shot deflected onto the post by Petrcek.
[4981.00 - 4985.00] P:1250.43 E:0.051288 |  But Chelsea so far keeping them at bay.
[4985.00 - 4991.00] P:1395.36 E:0.046094 |  Contento the fallback over on the left-hand side in field to the busy Schweinsteiger.
[4991.00 - 4994.00] P:1495.09 E:0.050340 |  Schweinsteiger just looking for the best option here.
[4994.00 - 4997.00] P:1435.27 E:0.058823 |  Looks for Robin, who seemed just a bit surprised to get that.
[4997.00 - 5002.00] P:1212.62 E:0.047913 |  And now it's with Laam, Laam finding Muller, tight to the line near side.
[5002.00 - 5005.00] P:1266.50 E:0.059842 |  Robin linking the play once more into Laam.
[5005.00 - 5010.00] P:1405.18 E:0.051491 |  Laam in the end just slipped over as he was trying to turn and check clears.
[5010.00 - 5013.00] P:1594.62 E:0.063162 |  There's a huge gap between the Chelsea midfield and Drogba.
[5013.00 - 5015.00] P:1533.58 E:0.057066 |  And Timershoek went swinging in there with the boot.
[5015.00 - 5021.00] P:1656.19 E:0.058848 |  Drogba can't get it and Neuer immediately sends the ball to Timershoek and Bayern Munich start again.
[5021.00 - 5026.00] P:1487.41 E:0.060436 |  They're getting a bit like Arsenal though, they seem to want to score the perfect goal by him.
[5026.00 - 5029.00] P:1698.27 E:0.063985 |  Well they are known as FC Hollywood aren't they?
[5029.00 - 5032.00] P:1200.62 E:0.066312 |  And that's maybe what they're trying here.
[5032.00 - 5036.00] P:1645.46 E:0.070705 |  But a great Chelsea noise now from away to our left.
[5036.00 - 5039.00] P:1373.51 E:0.076208 |  But it's Bayern Munich with the ball, they've had most of it this evening.
[5039.00 - 5042.00] P:1633.77 E:0.063018 |  Robin now, Ashley Cole and Bertrand are there.
[5042.00 - 5047.00] P:1476.48 E:0.066277 |  Robin feeding Cruz on the edge of the area and now it opens up for Laam down the right-hand side.
[5047.00 - 5050.00] P:1371.67 E:0.064981 |  And Ashley Cole's there with another important block.
[5050.00 - 5052.00] P:1521.89 E:0.051289 |  He must have had half a dozen.
[5052.00 - 5054.00] P:1535.68 E:0.059638 |  Was he appealing for handball there?
[5054.00 - 5055.00] P:1465.55 E:0.027210 |  It was Laam, yeah.
[5055.00 - 5056.00] P:1197.30 E:0.038669 |  Well it's a corner.
[5056.00 - 5058.00] P:1197.02 E:0.048203 |  It's a corner to Bayern.
[5058.00 - 5061.00] P:1348.60 E:0.049717 |  Chelsea still haven't had one, what are you pointing at?
[5061.00 - 5063.00] P:1583.30 E:0.068648 |  He's had another touch from the ball, boy.
[5063.00 - 5065.00] P:1508.44 E:0.055614 |  No, because he's been so long without him touching the ball.
[5065.00 - 5067.00] P:1420.79 E:0.056495 |  But they can be dangerous games for goalkeepers.
[5067.00 - 5070.00] P:1541.62 E:0.057605 |  Long, a corner kick, check flapped at that one a little bit.
[5070.00 - 5073.00] P:1528.79 E:0.062040 |  And Louise is standing firm at the back for Chelsea.
[5073.00 - 5077.00] P:1369.81 E:0.064123 |  But they still haven't cleared the ball and now it's Kalu all on his own.
[5077.00 - 5081.00] P:1530.39 E:0.066988 |  And he's going to lose this, he's tackled and Philipp Laam is driving forward
[5081.00 - 5085.00] P:1580.48 E:0.069285 |  and Dropper is there shoulder to shoulder with him in the penalty area.
[5085.00 - 5088.00] P:1649.04 E:0.063369 |  And Chelsea now desperate to get out of their own half as Matt defines Kalu.
[5088.00 - 5092.00] P:1469.21 E:0.061863 |  Well played didier Dropper, just sometimes when forwards in your area you think
[5092.00 - 5095.00] P:1556.97 E:0.065823 |  oh my goodness he's going to tackle but he was just so strong.
[5095.00 - 5099.00] P:1435.60 E:0.049621 |  Now Bayern have to get back but Chelsea have just held it.
[5099.00 - 5104.00] P:1357.73 E:0.056646 |  It's Lampard very deep at the moment in the Chelsea half, 21 and a half minutes gone
[5104.00 - 5106.00] P:1265.57 E:0.058925 |  nearly in the second half and it's still 0-0.
[5106.00 - 5110.00] P:1393.75 E:0.052878 |  I think Chelsea are going to get an outstanding chance in this game mate.
[5110.00 - 5112.00] P:1270.17 E:0.065435 |  It might be enough, sorry.
[5112.00 - 5117.00] P:1408.74 E:0.061046 |  Neuer, as we've been saying, hasn't really had to make a say
[5117.00 - 5121.00] P:1382.06 E:0.067061 |  but they sometimes can be very dangerous games for goalkeepers.
[5121.00 - 5125.00] P:1368.27 E:0.062750 |  Long ball now is over hit from Lampard, that's a bit unfranked Lampard like
[5125.00 - 5130.00] P:1526.56 E:0.057890 |  because he couldn't find Dropper and Bayern Munich now bringing it out once more.
[5130.00 - 5135.00] P:1553.44 E:0.053763 |  Kruss, for Contento the left back nearly 22 minutes gone in the second half.
[5135.00 - 5139.00] P:1440.43 E:0.052176 |  Contento for Bayern Munich, he's got Muller on the outside.
[5139.00 - 5142.00] P:1475.79 E:0.054695 |  Gomez waits and hopes for something coming his way.
[5142.00 - 5147.00] P:1360.97 E:0.054146 |  Reabery on the left edge of the penalty area has to send the ball back into midfield
[5147.00 - 5151.00] P:1542.48 E:0.059493 |  and it comes to Larm again, he's getting a lot of the ball down the right at the moment
[5151.00 - 5156.00] P:1599.79 E:0.055711 |  and so too is Robin and again Ashley Cole backs off and Robin tries a shot.
[5156.00 - 5159.00] P:1598.44 E:0.054153 |  Chelsea managed to get a block in, Schweinsteiger lifts it forward,
[5159.00 - 5162.00] P:1540.80 E:0.058780 |  Miquel was a little bit careless, Robin is going in,
[5162.00 - 5166.00] P:1494.76 E:0.057847 |  Luis got an important head to it, Miquel clears and here's Alan Green.
[5166.00 - 5171.00] P:1477.56 E:0.058083 |  And it's still 0-0, by the way the lines are open for 6-0-6 for Charles,
[5171.00 - 5177.00] P:1469.75 E:0.057891 |  present from Munich 0-599-6-9-3, Heaven only knows when I'll be presenting 6-0-6.
[5177.00 - 5179.00] P:1606.33 E:0.056453 |  We may have extra time, we may have penalties.
[5179.00 - 5182.00] P:1270.25 E:0.048443 |  Here's Philipp Lahm, the captain of Bayern Munich,
[5182.00 - 5186.00] P:1267.31 E:0.054733 |  couple of yards outside the Chelsea penalty area, to Reabery, Lahm again
[5186.00 - 5191.00] P:1248.69 E:0.047305 |  and on-node to the right and Muller, Muller doesn't cross first time,
[5191.00 - 5195.00] P:1304.15 E:0.059404 |  plays it back to Lahm, they do try to walk the ball into the penalty area.
[5195.00 - 5200.00] P:1383.68 E:0.043861 |  It's Muller again, towards the right touch line, faced by Ashley Cole,
[5200.00 - 5206.00] P:1365.11 E:0.051094 |  back-nited Reabery, Reabery into Schweinsteiger, Schweinsteiger runs forward now,
[5206.00 - 5209.00] P:1365.52 E:0.050272 |  he's right edge in the penalty area, Muller again,
[5209.00 - 5213.00] P:1663.48 E:0.058134 |  he still doesn't get the cross in and he's tackled by Cole's behind for a corner.
[5213.00 - 5216.00] P:1743.88 E:0.054851 |  Yet again, how many times have we mentioned Ashley Cole's name,
[5216.00 - 5218.00] P:1704.15 E:0.045420 |  outstanding he's been tonight.
[5218.00 - 5220.00] P:1684.74 E:0.058758 |  Why doesn't he cross the ball?
[5220.00 - 5222.00] P:1677.88 E:0.053958 |  Why don't any of them cross, Alan?
[5222.00 - 5224.00] P:1688.69 E:0.043285 |  How big's Gomez?
[5224.00 - 5226.00] P:1387.57 E:0.042963 |  I can't understand that.
[5226.00 - 5230.00] P:1507.21 E:0.057782 |  No, sorry, they're playing a little bit like Barcelona did against Chelsea.
[5230.00 - 5232.00] P:1619.57 E:0.042374 |  Not quite.
[5232.00 - 5236.00] P:1470.77 E:0.067516 |  Robin with a corner, left foot in, towards the near post and reached the far post
[5236.00 - 5240.00] P:1442.61 E:0.051126 |  and it's headed up and behind, corner again to Bayern Munich.
[5240.00 - 5243.00] P:1608.36 E:0.050266 |  Yeah, it was Bertrand wasn't it with that header maybe.
[5243.00 - 5246.00] P:1419.88 E:0.050849 |  Well, anybody will do, frankly.
[5246.00 - 5248.00] P:1339.01 E:0.053854 |  Robin wants more.
[5248.00 - 5254.00] P:1339.20 E:0.062596 |  And it's the assistant deal of the Asylons, a ball near the penalty area.
[5254.00 - 5257.00] P:1593.71 E:0.059708 |  Robin takes the corner in and it's headed away by Luis.
[5257.00 - 5259.00] P:1272.96 E:0.037378 |  And here's Matta.
[5259.00 - 5263.00] P:1266.09 E:0.051684 |  Matta sort of need the ball back in the direction of the captain Lampard
[5263.00 - 5265.00] P:1316.49 E:0.060239 |  who clears it up field, dropping towards Colou.
[5265.00 - 5269.00] P:1518.32 E:0.058502 |  Red shirts around him and Colou loses a devotee.
[5269.00 - 5274.00] P:1358.42 E:0.055656 |  21 minutes left for play here on 5-5, the World Service in BBC London, 94.9.
[5274.00 - 5279.00] P:1313.07 E:0.049836 |  That's how you're listening to the final of the 2012 Champions League.
[5279.00 - 5284.00] P:1199.56 E:0.044543 |  It's with Schweinsteiger inside the centre-circle, on to Lamp.
[5284.00 - 5289.00] P:1388.27 E:0.055028 |  Lamp, now midway inside the Chelsea half, flicks it to the right.
[5289.00 - 5291.00] P:1325.62 E:0.061994 |  Surely Robin will cross it. Not yet he won't.
[5291.00 - 5294.00] P:1275.60 E:0.051045 |  Robin controls the ball though, faced by Bertrand.
[5294.00 - 5297.00] P:1452.11 E:0.056792 |  Robin on his left foot, slides it back, here's an opportunity,
[5297.00 - 5301.00] P:1442.51 E:0.065389 |  shot forward, blocked by a Chelsea body, was that actually called again?
[5301.00 - 5303.00] P:1576.33 E:0.064833 |  I don't know.
[5303.00 - 5305.00] P:1610.89 E:0.061907 |  Was it with the cross or with the shot?
[5305.00 - 5309.00] P:1510.66 E:0.053501 |  Well, they are probing it.
[5309.00 - 5311.00] P:1471.41 E:0.039527 |  They are probing.
[5311.00 - 5314.00] P:1465.45 E:0.053436 |  But they're not incisive enough for Van Munich.
[5314.00 - 5317.00] P:1284.77 E:0.045762 |  Thank goodness for Chelsea at the moment, they're not.
[5317.00 - 5320.00] P:1325.56 E:0.059965 |  Croes is going to take this free kick for Van Munich.
[5320.00 - 5323.00] P:1348.49 E:0.063647 |  And how many Van Clauser inside the Chelsea penalty area?
[5323.00 - 5325.00] P:1310.21 E:0.062693 |  Five at the moment.
[5325.00 - 5329.00] P:1420.11 E:0.063946 |  So it will be six as Schweinsteiger joins in.
[5329.00 - 5332.00] P:1675.25 E:0.064677 |  Kalu's nowhere near ten yards back from the free kick.
[5332.00 - 5336.00] P:1664.47 E:0.053491 |  There are frees pulling him back, verbally pulling him back.
[5336.00 - 5341.00] P:1835.33 E:0.054268 |  Croes with a free kick, 20 minutes to go here in Munich, still 0-0.
[5341.00 - 5343.00] P:2004.16 E:0.035542 |  Croes waits.
[5343.00 - 5346.00] P:1813.23 E:0.053930 |  Where is Gomez? It's played in towards Gomez,
[5346.00 - 5348.00] P:1329.79 E:0.054799 |  but it's a simple header away by Lampard,
[5348.00 - 5351.00] P:1354.17 E:0.050106 |  and then Timershoek heads it back to the captain Lamp,
[5351.00 - 5353.00] P:1207.65 E:0.045362 |  on the halfway line in the centre-circle.
[5353.00 - 5356.00] P:1326.56 E:0.051697 |  Timershoek the Ukrainian again, on to Robin.
[5356.00 - 5360.00] P:1473.86 E:0.055362 |  Robin now runs in towards the penalty area, takes it inside of Bertrand,
[5360.00 - 5362.00] P:1559.71 E:0.053792 |  shoots, takes a reflection off Bertrand,
[5362.00 - 5365.00] P:1364.36 E:0.055763 |  balls, edges of the penalty area and should be cleared.
[5365.00 - 5368.00] P:1394.26 E:0.056163 |  It's carefully cleared by Lampard, well done, Frank.
[5368.00 - 5371.00] P:1526.58 E:0.049155 |  Didn't get too worked up, just controlled himself.
[5371.00 - 5374.00] P:1847.49 E:0.057597 |  On it goes to Drogba, Drogba tackled by Dimitri,
[5374.00 - 5377.00] P:1827.53 E:0.062166 |  who, aside from the odd stray passes, played really well.
[5377.00 - 5379.00] P:1757.37 E:0.050247 |  And it's hard to play for a throw into Chelsea.
[5379.00 - 5382.00] P:1590.38 E:0.057879 |  Strange isn't it, 70, come up to 71 minutes, no changes,
[5382.00 - 5385.00] P:1563.86 E:0.049748 |  no changes at all from either side.
[5385.00 - 5387.00] P:1654.43 E:0.071976 |  There might be soon, though.
[5387.00 - 5390.00] P:1693.92 E:0.062185 |  Well, they're obviously thinking about the extra time,
[5390.00 - 5392.00] P:1617.04 E:0.049826 |  as well, aren't they, both managers?
[5392.00 - 5395.00] P:1728.18 E:0.063785 |  I think Malouda is warming up for Chelsea at the moment.
[5396.00 - 5399.00] P:1873.17 E:0.063475 |  And he might think Torres will get his chance.
[5399.00 - 5403.00] P:1833.64 E:0.056582 |  But here's Kalu, to Marta, and Vesingua to his right,
[5403.00 - 5406.00] P:1744.40 E:0.062193 |  and it's on to Vesingua, will he cross first time?
[5406.00 - 5409.00] P:1494.78 E:0.070250 |  Yes, he does in towards Kalu, good defensive header away by Dimitri.
[5409.00 - 5412.00] P:1543.46 E:0.058662 |  Played back in towards Drogba, out comes Neuer,
[5412.00 - 5414.00] P:1773.92 E:0.062275 |  and he catches the ball securely.
[5414.00 - 5417.00] P:1760.07 E:0.062804 |  I know it's only across my... Alan, but he was under pressure.
[5417.00 - 5420.00] P:1621.02 E:0.065113 |  I'm Alan Ismael. Yeah, I know. I know it was one of you.
[5420.00 - 5424.00] P:1644.42 E:0.052834 |  Here's Robin, Ribbri rushing forward, but Robin delays.
[5424.00 - 5426.00] P:1636.05 E:0.055288 |  Robin cuts in, edge of the penalty,
[5426.00 - 5429.00] P:1659.44 E:0.064881 |  should try to put in straighter check, he saves easily.
[5429.00 - 5432.00] P:1740.25 E:0.060289 |  But better, isn't it? That's probably the fourth to fifth time,
[5432.00 - 5435.00] P:1735.40 E:0.058177 |  second half, where Robin or Ribbri is cut inside.
[5435.00 - 5438.00] P:1666.74 E:0.051804 |  That was a better strike, comfortable save in the end,
[5438.00 - 5441.00] P:1355.57 E:0.044513 |  but you've got to start shooting if you're by a Munich.
[5441.00 - 5444.00] P:1566.80 E:0.048084 |  Check, delays clearing until now,
[5444.00 - 5447.00] P:1550.24 E:0.045125 |  and he smacks it left, put it in the direction of Drogba.
[5447.00 - 5451.00] P:1376.89 E:0.047282 |  Drogba actually sort of beaten in the air by La Malut is coming on.
[5451.00 - 5454.00] P:1321.12 E:0.033955 |  Who for? What do you reckon?
[5454.00 - 5457.00] P:1300.82 E:0.035281 |  Burt's run, you think?
[5457.00 - 5461.00] P:1573.92 E:0.042745 |  Well, it could be. It's another attacking move
[5461.00 - 5463.00] P:1277.24 E:0.048702 |  by Roberta Dimitriou.
[5463.00 - 5466.00] P:1397.90 E:0.058959 |  Here's Drogba. Oh, Drogba's away from Timershoe.
[5466.00 - 5468.00] P:1514.55 E:0.062708 |  Drogba left edge of the penalty here,
[5468.00 - 5470.00] P:1328.68 E:0.072213 |  and that is on the near-pulled in play,
[5470.00 - 5472.00] P:1512.21 E:0.066250 |  and put behind by Contento for a corner.
[5472.00 - 5475.00] P:1617.84 E:0.069291 |  Yeah, well done, Contento. Good defending into your left back.
[5475.00 - 5477.00] P:1513.96 E:0.072107 |  You get yourself in the middle of the penalty area
[5477.00 - 5480.00] P:1674.26 E:0.058214 |  and you deal with the ball that comes across the six-yard box.
[5480.00 - 5484.00] P:1662.97 E:0.052228 |  It is Bertrand who's coming off to be in the play spine, Malouda.
[5484.00 - 5486.00] P:1765.31 E:0.070058 |  Well, the 22-year-old's done really well.
[5486.00 - 5490.00] P:1777.54 E:0.058275 |  He certainly has justified the ball selection by Dimitriou.
[5490.00 - 5492.00] P:1668.47 E:0.068456 |  The other thing as well, Arnie,
[5492.00 - 5494.00] P:1695.06 E:0.057197 |  he won't have played in that position too many times.
[5494.00 - 5497.00] P:1645.43 E:0.054616 |  I know he played against it in Blackburn in the last game of the Premier League,
[5497.00 - 5499.00] P:1744.10 E:0.054697 |  so he's done exceptionally well.
[5499.00 - 5501.00] P:1792.51 E:0.053360 |  Well done, young man.
[5501.00 - 5504.00] P:1898.50 E:0.050436 |  And now Malouda is on,
[5504.00 - 5507.00] P:1595.78 E:0.049169 |  and Miquel just wants a drink.
[5507.00 - 5510.00] P:1147.99 E:0.055105 |  I thought that was going to be a corner kick,
[5510.00 - 5512.00] P:1428.77 E:0.066488 |  but it's only a throw in to Chelsea, taken by Cole.
[5512.00 - 5514.00] P:1307.10 E:0.055144 |  To the set, Malouda.
[5514.00 - 5517.00] P:1301.27 E:0.049896 |  Malouda yard outside the firing penalty area to Cole.
[5517.00 - 5520.00] P:1423.43 E:0.061945 |  Cole crosses in, Nora comes, only fouls it away,
[5520.00 - 5522.00] P:1429.10 E:0.065570 |  and it was a weak shot by Colou.
[5522.00 - 5524.00] P:1665.96 E:0.061621 |  Oh, Drogba runs.
[5524.00 - 5528.00] P:1759.50 E:0.061236 |  Yeah, the thing was, though, because Nia was struggling to get back,
[5528.00 - 5530.00] P:1472.13 E:0.050949 |  he wanted to hit it early,
[5530.00 - 5532.00] P:1456.38 E:0.040368 |  and unfortunately just didn't make great contact.
[5532.00 - 5534.00] P:1278.04 E:0.053742 |  Nia's got away with one a little bit.
[5534.00 - 5536.00] P:1202.67 E:0.047836 |  Well, he has not a lot to do,
[5536.00 - 5539.00] P:1327.11 E:0.048081 |  so maybe concentration, a bit of a problem.
[5539.00 - 5542.00] P:1364.42 E:0.049750 |  You wouldn't think so in a Champions League final.
[5542.00 - 5545.00] P:1493.43 E:0.056372 |  Anyway, Crows jumps, and it's actually a swanky tiger,
[5545.00 - 5547.00] P:1639.36 E:0.062151 |  and he fouls, Clows.
[5547.00 - 5549.00] P:1781.06 E:0.055338 |  I think it was a previous foul, you know.
[5549.00 - 5551.00] P:1439.13 E:0.054849 |  On Cahill by Gomez,
[5551.00 - 5553.00] P:1321.67 E:0.048216 |  it's the referee who realised Chelsea didn't have vantage,
[5553.00 - 5555.00] P:1566.52 E:0.039551 |  so he pulled them back.
[5555.00 - 5557.00] P:1558.76 E:0.065409 |  16 minutes to go.
[5557.00 - 5559.00] P:1382.78 E:0.046414 |  Barn Munich, Niel, Chelsea near.
[5559.00 - 5563.00] P:1621.31 E:0.053551 |  Cahill to Lamperd, who has had such a disciplined game tonight.
[5563.00 - 5566.00] P:1475.12 E:0.053271 |  You know, we normally expect to see Lamperd rampaging forward,
[5566.00 - 5569.00] P:1505.58 E:0.052008 |  but he stayed back, and I think he's needed to stay back.
[5569.00 - 5571.00] P:1627.34 E:0.061868 |  Colou didn't throw his fouls.
[5571.00 - 5573.00] P:1716.79 E:0.054141 |  And it's actually, and McKellen himself have done extremely well.
[5573.00 - 5576.00] P:1446.01 E:0.032094 |  Both of them. Yeah, it's a barrier, isn't it?
[5576.00 - 5580.00] P:1414.31 E:0.050953 |  Schweinsteiger back to Neuer in front of the Chelsea fans.
[5580.00 - 5584.00] P:1722.85 E:0.053186 |  Neuer rather delayed the clearance, hits it, upfield.
[5584.00 - 5587.00] P:1686.87 E:0.056047 |  Oh, and long last the guy in the Tannard,
[5587.00 - 5589.00] P:1989.31 E:0.043752 |  knows there's been a substitution.
[5589.00 - 5592.00] P:1715.91 E:0.049511 |  So he has his second big moment, his mom and dad will be proud.
[5592.00 - 5595.00] P:1737.45 E:0.054450 |  Cole, over the halfway line, into Drogba.
[5595.00 - 5597.00] P:1694.52 E:0.052255 |  Drogba tried to feed it back to Ashley Cole,
[5597.00 - 5600.00] P:1698.97 E:0.053309 |  but it hits a foul, and player refounds to Robyn.
[5600.00 - 5603.00] P:1447.53 E:0.042796 |  Well done, Drogba. He's getting back to make the challenge.
[5603.00 - 5606.00] P:1439.00 E:0.055662 |  Robyn down the right side, checks in field, in now to Ribbry.
[5606.00 - 5608.00] P:1519.94 E:0.057516 |  Yard, I say the penalty here.
[5608.00 - 5610.00] P:1523.01 E:0.055371 |  Stabs it forward, and no.
[5610.00 - 5612.00] P:1495.33 E:0.056535 |  Muller can't turn the ball forwards.
[5612.00 - 5616.00] P:1670.78 E:0.055025 |  It's put behind by Cale, or played by Cale until he throws it.
[5616.00 - 5618.00] P:1681.95 E:0.053730 |  It's just a wrong decision, really.
[5618.00 - 5620.00] P:1655.63 E:0.051022 |  I think the ball was let Muller make.
[5620.00 - 5621.00] P:1209.11 E:0.051184 |  They only took defenders away.
[5621.00 - 5623.00] P:1351.38 E:0.048110 |  The ball was more to the left-hand side, however.
[5623.00 - 5625.00] P:1099.95 E:0.047628 |  Quarter of an hour to go.
[5625.00 - 5626.00] P:1777.84 E:0.053306 |  Chelsea have made a change.
[5626.00 - 5630.00] P:1256.45 E:0.044804 |  No sign of an alteration yet by Barn Munich.
[5630.00 - 5633.00] P:1362.94 E:0.048225 |  Robyn with the throwing to Ribbry.
[5633.00 - 5634.00] P:1310.32 E:0.068282 |  And Ribbry falls down.
[5634.00 - 5636.00] P:1491.24 E:0.063288 |  Looking for a free kick. He hasn't got it.
[5636.00 - 5638.00] P:1669.90 E:0.056829 |  Well done, the assistant.
[5638.00 - 5640.00] P:1579.65 E:0.065606 |  Oh, no, it's given away by Chelsea.
[5640.00 - 5642.00] P:1393.68 E:0.040108 |  That was poor. Laugh.
[5642.00 - 5644.00] P:1510.63 E:0.063386 |  Edge of the Chelsea penalty into Ribbry.
[5644.00 - 5645.00] P:1527.37 E:0.066042 |  Ribbry's pass lamp out.
[5645.00 - 5646.00] P:1516.30 E:0.060557 |  Ribbry still going.
[5646.00 - 5648.00] P:1494.64 E:0.065593 |  Gets the cross, inflicts in the air out for the defender,
[5648.00 - 5650.00] P:1427.79 E:0.067716 |  and is found behind by Cac for a corner.
[5650.00 - 5652.00] P:1721.13 E:0.066508 |  It's a great save, Alan, because he's running back
[5652.00 - 5654.00] P:1566.07 E:0.065465 |  towards his own goal, Cacac,
[5654.00 - 5657.00] P:1677.39 E:0.060353 |  and it was just creeping in under the bar.
[5657.00 - 5659.00] P:1744.49 E:0.057752 |  He's had to stretch right-handed after the deflection
[5659.00 - 5661.00] P:1557.99 E:0.045622 |  and just help it over.
[5662.00 - 5665.00] P:1371.23 E:0.054122 |  Robyn to take the corner from the right, played in left,
[5665.00 - 5667.00] P:1518.47 E:0.045971 |  but it rushed it corner.
[5667.00 - 5669.00] P:1372.26 E:0.056600 |  Didn't beat the first defender. That was Lampard.
[5669.00 - 5671.00] P:1537.93 E:0.048039 |  The clearance goes to Timershook.
[5671.00 - 5673.00] P:1514.96 E:0.047489 |  Timershook feeds it to Robyn again,
[5673.00 - 5675.00] P:1355.15 E:0.058237 |  and Robyn runs in towards the penalty area
[5675.00 - 5678.00] P:1578.96 E:0.054523 |  and ran into Lampard, and it's behind for another corner.
[5678.00 - 5680.00] P:1699.92 E:0.057434 |  Chelsea have done that wonderfully well,
[5680.00 - 5683.00] P:1547.06 E:0.048733 |  where they've just stood up when both Robyn and Ribbry
[5683.00 - 5685.00] P:1550.38 E:0.060977 |  have been running at them
[5685.00 - 5687.00] P:1324.80 E:0.050606 |  and made it really difficult for them to go past them.
[5687.00 - 5689.00] P:1387.78 E:0.054087 |  Robyn's corner, 14 minutes to go,
[5689.00 - 5690.00] P:1646.97 E:0.059926 |  deeper this time.
[5690.00 - 5692.00] P:1366.33 E:0.047202 |  Well defended by Drogba.
[5692.00 - 5694.00] P:1525.43 E:0.053632 |  He's headed away.
[5694.00 - 5696.00] P:1453.93 E:0.050993 |  Schweinsteiger controls it.
[5696.00 - 5698.00] P:1468.80 E:0.045625 |  Left side of the penalty area, the Chelsea penalty area.
[5698.00 - 5700.00] P:1436.98 E:0.051467 |  Schweinsteiger back to Cruz.
[5700.00 - 5702.00] P:1576.82 E:0.053905 |  Cruz attempted to shoot from 30 yards,
[5702.00 - 5704.00] P:1282.83 E:0.046447 |  shoots left-footed, hits an offender,
[5704.00 - 5708.00] P:1320.84 E:0.045083 |  and rebounds to Bayern on the far side of the field.
[5708.00 - 5711.00] P:1271.46 E:0.044726 |  Bayern continue to probe,
[5711.00 - 5713.00] P:1247.09 E:0.043458 |  continue to dominate the game.
[5714.00 - 5717.00] P:1397.75 E:0.055750 |  It's with Cruz to the left side,
[5717.00 - 5720.00] P:1412.38 E:0.052535 |  and Schweinsteiger back to Cruz.
[5720.00 - 5723.00] P:1290.24 E:0.056887 |  Cruz looking to the right side, towards Robyn.
[5723.00 - 5726.00] P:1278.73 E:0.042517 |  And it's a firm pass, hit towards the Dutchman.
[5726.00 - 5728.00] P:1418.19 E:0.048408 |  Robyn controls it, cuts in field.
[5728.00 - 5731.00] P:1404.26 E:0.045167 |  Doesn't find Muller with his pass,
[5731.00 - 5734.00] P:1387.10 E:0.054396 |  and then Muller trying to win the ball back.
[5734.00 - 5737.00] P:1732.76 E:0.051771 |  Trips for Chelsea player, and it's a free kick.
[5738.00 - 5741.00] P:1544.93 E:0.045888 |  Robyn does that so many times though, doesn't he?
[5741.00 - 5742.00] P:1669.83 E:0.044596 |  That sort of faints,
[5742.00 - 5744.00] P:1475.31 E:0.057733 |  to sort of go past people and try and play a little one-two,
[5744.00 - 5746.00] P:1580.80 E:0.062179 |  and Chelsea are wise to it now.
[5746.00 - 5749.00] P:1400.91 E:0.061373 |  Steve Bruce sitting a few yards to our left.
[5749.00 - 5751.00] P:1383.58 E:0.066423 |  Steve, what are your thoughts?
[5751.00 - 5753.00] P:1564.28 E:0.066729 |  It would be interesting to see if Bayern
[5753.00 - 5755.00] P:1563.54 E:0.054348 |  ever changed them over, you know,
[5755.00 - 5757.00] P:1666.18 E:0.052317 |  and give us a little bit of dimension,
[5757.00 - 5759.00] P:1690.82 E:0.053773 |  where maybe they go on the outside,
[5759.00 - 5761.00] P:1602.20 E:0.046129 |  because every time they keep cutting in on the inside,
[5761.00 - 5763.00] P:1540.14 E:0.053499 |  and Chelsea have done very, very well defensively
[5763.00 - 5765.00] P:1707.25 E:0.048868 |  to play against them.
[5765.00 - 5767.00] P:1332.59 E:0.059319 |  Checks free kick, driven mightily upfield,
[5767.00 - 5770.00] P:1430.49 E:0.048510 |  but Drogba can't help it on towards Matta.
[5770.00 - 5773.00] P:1478.18 E:0.061999 |  And here's Schweinsteiger, mid-air inside his own half.
[5773.00 - 5775.00] P:1348.53 E:0.055296 |  That's a lovely ball forward now.
[5775.00 - 5777.00] P:1450.87 E:0.041233 |  Muller to Robyn,
[5777.00 - 5779.00] P:1514.65 E:0.057537 |  and onto Ribbery on the far side.
[5779.00 - 5782.00] P:1590.94 E:0.051566 |  Ribbery now approaching the Chelsea penalty area into it.
[5782.00 - 5784.00] P:1618.59 E:0.058346 |  Beats for single ones, then he feeds it back.
[5784.00 - 5786.00] P:1522.11 E:0.066046 |  It might fall. Oh, my goodness!
[5786.00 - 5788.00] P:1483.21 E:0.063325 |  Shot by Muller.
[5788.00 - 5790.00] P:1699.08 E:0.061069 |  He should have got it in target.
[5790.00 - 5792.00] P:1727.96 E:0.058346 |  Well, it came to him on his left foot.
[5792.00 - 5794.00] P:1584.29 E:0.050066 |  You think he's going to hit it with his left,
[5794.00 - 5796.00] P:1526.35 E:0.054857 |  and he sort of had a change of mind,
[5796.00 - 5798.00] P:1619.38 E:0.054267 |  and let it bounce, and he's going to hit it with his right,
[5798.00 - 5800.00] P:1402.79 E:0.055885 |  and he just dragged it.
[5800.00 - 5802.00] P:1203.54 E:0.042544 |  Just dragged it worldwide in the far post.
[5802.00 - 5804.00] P:1617.99 E:0.052955 |  Do place your calls for 6-0-6,
[5804.00 - 5806.00] P:1388.14 E:0.056917 |  even if you don't get on for quite a while.
[5806.00 - 5808.00] P:1440.12 E:0.046173 |  Extra time looming, 12 minutes away.
[5808.00 - 5811.00] P:1416.76 E:0.054700 |  The number for 6-0-6, 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3.
[5811.00 - 5814.00] P:1605.90 E:0.059465 |  Whatever time it starts, I'll be presenting an hour of your calls
[5814.00 - 5817.00] P:1419.17 E:0.049285 |  at the conclusion to this Champions League final.
[5817.00 - 5820.00] P:1426.46 E:0.047253 |  And remember, West Ham back in the Premier League
[5820.00 - 5824.00] P:1314.81 E:0.057134 |  after beating Blackpool in the playoff final at Wembley.
[5824.00 - 5827.00] P:1602.30 E:0.042192 |  Hearts thrashed hibs in the Scottish Cup final.
[5827.00 - 5829.00] P:1569.79 E:0.045705 |  And, of course, a little story this week,
[5829.00 - 5832.00] P:1623.95 E:0.047371 |  emanating from Merseyside Delglesat.
[5832.00 - 5835.00] P:1811.92 E:0.040520 |  Robyn for Bayern Munich.
[5835.00 - 5837.00] P:1675.97 E:0.060639 |  Robyn, and this controls the ball,
[5837.00 - 5840.00] P:1464.48 E:0.054138 |  allows Lampard to take it off quite easily.
[5840.00 - 5843.00] P:1387.20 E:0.047613 |  Lampard again from Calou's pass.
[5843.00 - 5845.00] P:1569.14 E:0.054627 |  Well played, Frank Lampard.
[5845.00 - 5847.00] P:1334.26 E:0.043885 |  I've won for it, yeah, well played.
[5847.00 - 5849.00] P:1612.94 E:0.042860 |  What was the last time Gomez took the ball in this game?
[5849.00 - 5851.00] P:1585.19 E:0.053242 |  A long time ago.
[5851.00 - 5853.00] P:1607.47 E:0.047639 |  Well, you see, look what he is now.
[5853.00 - 5855.00] P:1488.23 E:0.056295 |  He's on the halfway line.
[5855.00 - 5857.00] P:1371.53 E:0.048117 |  He's no use there at all.
[5857.00 - 5859.00] P:1413.91 E:0.063657 |  Dragba. Oh, that's a good ball to the right side.
[5859.00 - 5861.00] P:1512.48 E:0.049042 |  Matta now, near the penalty area.
[5861.00 - 5863.00] P:1469.51 E:0.049784 |  Matta, can he find a blue shirt in the pass?
[5863.00 - 5866.00] P:1542.80 E:0.052447 |  No, he couldn't because it was blocked by Schweinsteiger,
[5866.00 - 5868.00] P:1521.90 E:0.051548 |  and it's out of play for Chelsea throwing.
[5868.00 - 5871.00] P:1287.84 E:0.058281 |  Matta wasted a good opportunity there.
[5871.00 - 5874.00] P:1186.87 E:0.061359 |  Fraction under 11 minutes to go.
[5874.00 - 5877.00] P:1352.83 E:0.058156 |  Look forward to see if there's a Bayern substitution
[5877.00 - 5879.00] P:1410.74 E:0.055936 |  about to be made.
[5879.00 - 5883.00] P:1566.25 E:0.046649 |  Not yet, though a couple players are getting ready.
[5883.00 - 5885.00] P:1736.38 E:0.055693 |  Bersingua with a throw-in,
[5885.00 - 5888.00] P:1666.28 E:0.053361 |  level with the edge of the Bayern penalty area.
[5888.00 - 5890.00] P:1662.30 E:0.057736 |  Apart from Calou's shot,
[5890.00 - 5893.00] P:1826.47 E:0.050666 |  Norris had next to nothing to do.
[5893.00 - 5895.00] P:1845.06 E:0.053178 |  Go on, make him work, Chelsea.
[5895.00 - 5897.00] P:1659.96 E:0.049490 |  Bersingua throws the ball into the penalty area,
[5897.00 - 5901.00] P:1380.72 E:0.062345 |  comes out of a red shirt, feels for handball,
[5901.00 - 5904.00] P:1334.04 E:0.064146 |  and, no, I didn't think so, but they weren't appealing anyway.
[5904.00 - 5907.00] P:1491.43 E:0.054305 |  I think only one person appealed, actually, on the field of play.
[5907.00 - 5911.00] P:1435.81 E:0.049779 |  It was thousands of Chelsea fans who were screaming for a penalty.
[5911.00 - 5913.00] P:1370.51 E:0.055824 |  No, it's head-away towards the pass,
[5913.00 - 5916.00] P:1469.93 E:0.053125 |  and that's a great pass, great control too,
[5916.00 - 5919.00] P:1363.71 E:0.056107 |  by Bersingua. No, can he get the ball into the penalty area?
[5919.00 - 5923.00] P:1439.95 E:0.055439 |  No, it's played back, and it's with Matta.
[5923.00 - 5926.00] P:1649.40 E:0.060700 |  Matta, rolling towards the far side of the field,
[5926.00 - 5929.00] P:1810.39 E:0.054525 |  on by Bersingua to Frank Lampard.
[5929.00 - 5931.00] P:1586.12 E:0.064476 |  To Matta, not a great ball from Lampard,
[5931.00 - 5933.00] P:1630.93 E:0.054157 |  and it's head-away for a Bayern throw-in.
[5933.00 - 5935.00] P:1721.29 E:0.054099 |  10 minutes to go, 0-0.
[5935.00 - 5939.00] P:1762.95 E:0.055100 |  Yeah, just a little bit of a waste in quite an advantageous position,
[5939.00 - 5942.00] P:1786.91 E:0.056370 |  and it's important, Chelsea, to keep the ball in the corner there.
[5942.00 - 5946.00] P:1759.10 E:0.050232 |  I do feel there will get a chance before the 90 minutes is up.
[5947.00 - 5950.00] P:1549.74 E:0.056526 |  Kain quite a while for Contento to take this throw-in.
[5950.00 - 5954.00] P:1428.04 E:0.055878 |  He throws it finally to Boateng, who lashes it upfield,
[5954.00 - 5956.00] P:1329.87 E:0.060230 |  headed away well by Kaile, both Kaile,
[5956.00 - 5959.00] P:1330.72 E:0.054977 |  and generally, Louise have played well.
[5959.00 - 5961.00] P:1326.51 E:0.052066 |  The odd aberration from Louise,
[5961.00 - 5963.00] P:1438.09 E:0.054013 |  but that appears to be in the Brazilian's nature.
[5963.00 - 5965.00] P:1521.68 E:0.062219 |  Oh, that's a good pass to Matta. Matta now.
[5965.00 - 5967.00] P:1246.23 E:0.059084 |  Has drug available?
[5967.00 - 5970.00] P:1459.43 E:0.054110 |  Try to feed it to the left instead, the Colm's intercepted,
[5970.00 - 5972.00] P:1419.18 E:0.050877 |  and now on the counterattack.
[5972.00 - 5975.00] P:1423.43 E:0.064203 |  Bayern Munich with Muller, filed by Ashley Cole.
[5975.00 - 5977.00] P:1525.73 E:0.062859 |  They'll take it.
[5977.00 - 5979.00] P:1653.53 E:0.049495 |  He knows, he's walking away.
[5979.00 - 5981.00] P:1707.73 E:0.061043 |  You know what he was doing.
[5983.00 - 5985.00] P:1390.00 E:0.040508 |  Do you really sense a goal?
[5985.00 - 5989.00] P:1132.33 E:0.050126 |  I think no matter how poorly you play sometimes,
[5989.00 - 5993.00] P:1345.63 E:0.062517 |  you always get a chance, always, always.
[5994.00 - 5999.00] P:1415.10 E:0.044977 |  It has to be said, we've got to judge the game thoroughly,
[5999.00 - 6001.00] P:1520.10 E:0.050515 |  and Bayern have been the better side.
[6001.00 - 6003.00] P:1622.29 E:0.059047 |  Oh, Cricky, yeah. More threatening side.
[6003.00 - 6005.00] P:1271.28 E:0.039461 |  Crick is, no doubt about that.
[6005.00 - 6007.00] P:1409.92 E:0.061287 |  Free kick taken. Doesn't matter, though.
[6007.00 - 6010.00] P:1498.24 E:0.060739 |  No. Fast loaner with a better side in the two legs against Chelsea.
[6010.00 - 6013.00] P:1433.84 E:0.056958 |  Robin onto Ribbri, down the far side of the field to the left.
[6013.00 - 6016.00] P:1523.31 E:0.050760 |  Contento runs ahead of the Frenchman.
[6016.00 - 6018.00] P:1514.48 E:0.055548 |  Ribbri keeps the ball, but the ball breaks to Contento.
[6018.00 - 6020.00] P:1550.99 E:0.039971 |  Contento doesn't cross it.
[6020.00 - 6022.00] P:1600.40 E:0.047001 |  They seem disinclined across it.
[6022.00 - 6025.00] P:1542.85 E:0.064349 |  Robin now sweeps it in, and it's a header down by Muller.
[6025.00 - 6027.00] P:1800.98 E:0.059148 |  Safe by Czech. Well, there you go.
[6027.00 - 6029.00] P:1844.78 E:0.061480 |  You've got to cross it, and you have an effort at goal.
[6029.00 - 6031.00] P:1846.40 E:0.034460 |  It's quite simple.
[6031.00 - 6033.00] P:1702.89 E:0.040545 |  Check with the clearance.
[6033.00 - 6039.00] P:1425.88 E:0.046674 |  Drogba cleverly pushed Timmy Schuch, but didn't get the ball.
[6039.00 - 6043.00] P:1390.64 E:0.061478 |  And it's a good pass by Schveinsteiger to Robin on the far side.
[6043.00 - 6045.00] P:1494.62 E:0.058899 |  The game's really stretched out.
[6045.00 - 6047.00] P:1346.19 E:0.054535 |  Deep into it.
[6047.00 - 6050.00] P:1431.16 E:0.051189 |  Eight minutes of the regular 90 to go.
[6050.00 - 6052.00] P:1439.15 E:0.039756 |  Can Ribbri get it back?
[6052.00 - 6054.00] P:1585.57 E:0.054564 |  It's just to the edge of the penalty.
[6054.00 - 6055.00] P:1596.03 E:0.062434 |  There's the cross.
[6055.00 - 6059.00] P:1706.11 E:0.074157 |  And he goes, go, miss Muller with that, and it's off the underside of the crossbar.
[6059.00 - 6063.00] P:1524.99 E:0.072646 |  And with eight minutes left for play, Muller has hit it.
[6063.00 - 6065.00] P:1409.65 E:0.071766 |  Far and Munich in front.
[6065.00 - 6067.00] P:1495.86 E:0.072407 |  It's been coming. They deserve it.
[6067.00 - 6069.00] P:1414.77 E:0.074092 |  Far and Munich won.
[6069.00 - 6070.00] P:1390.37 E:0.075574 |  Jossi Nielsen.
[6070.00 - 6071.00] P:1465.25 E:0.067544 |  Well, you know what?
[6071.00 - 6073.00] P:1506.65 E:0.073695 |  It was almost a carbon copy of the cross
[6073.00 - 6075.00] P:1435.01 E:0.072433 |  from probably 90 seconds ago,
[6075.00 - 6078.00] P:1455.96 E:0.067879 |  when Muller came in from the right-hand sidehand
[6078.00 - 6080.00] P:1396.37 E:0.071347 |  and got in front, or above, actually, goal.
[6080.00 - 6083.00] P:1600.62 E:0.066148 |  This time he just got in front of him, headed it down,
[6083.00 - 6085.00] P:1464.85 E:0.069351 |  and Czech was absolutely helpless.
[6085.00 - 6087.00] P:1503.57 E:0.065599 |  There's nothing he could do about it.
[6087.00 - 6090.00] P:1537.84 E:0.067933 |  So we kept saying, why don't they cross?
[6090.00 - 6092.00] P:1468.87 E:0.062578 |  Now you know why.
[6092.00 - 6094.00] P:1306.25 E:0.072453 |  No, we don't know why,
[6094.00 - 6096.00] P:1576.20 E:0.060944 |  because they've actually threatened more
[6096.00 - 6098.00] P:1453.07 E:0.066587 |  when they've crossed the ball in early.
[6098.00 - 6100.00] P:1366.80 E:0.067726 |  The number of times it's in Robert and Ribbri
[6100.00 - 6102.00] P:1465.99 E:0.062831 |  run towards the penalty area,
[6102.00 - 6103.00] P:1592.37 E:0.054585 |  declining to cross it,
[6103.00 - 6105.00] P:1598.57 E:0.062814 |  and the last two occasions they've done it,
[6105.00 - 6107.00] P:1664.26 E:0.058341 |  they've threatened and know they've scored.
[6107.00 - 6109.00] P:1574.11 E:0.061742 |  Have you seen what happened as well?
[6109.00 - 6111.00] P:1641.42 E:0.058071 |  Gomez backed onto Ashley Cole,
[6111.00 - 6112.00] P:1591.36 E:0.063283 |  pinned him, jumping.
[6112.00 - 6116.00] P:1597.08 E:0.065235 |  Well, he couldn't jump, so Muller had a free header at the far post.
[6116.00 - 6119.00] P:1613.27 E:0.070092 |  Thomas Muller would not have played,
[6119.00 - 6121.00] P:1731.96 E:0.058362 |  or certainly would not have started,
[6121.00 - 6123.00] P:1786.72 E:0.059835 |  this final but for suspensions.
[6123.00 - 6124.00] P:1073.27 E:0.057166 |  But he scored.
[6124.00 - 6127.00] P:1612.94 E:0.065146 |  It's his second Champions League goal of the campaign.
[6127.00 - 6129.00] P:1420.75 E:0.065861 |  It might be the only goal of the final.
[6129.00 - 6132.00] P:1431.07 E:0.066152 |  The ball played forward toward Drogba.
[6132.00 - 6133.00] P:1250.09 E:0.062273 |  Drogba falls an offender,
[6133.00 - 6136.00] P:1672.86 E:0.052397 |  and it's a free kick to Bayern Munich.
[6136.00 - 6139.00] P:1638.16 E:0.075864 |  And we're going to get Fernando Torres on for Calu.
[6141.00 - 6143.00] P:1709.16 E:0.056991 |  Asking a lot, isn't it now?
[6144.00 - 6146.00] P:1579.36 E:0.068737 |  I wonder will he play on the right side,
[6146.00 - 6149.00] P:1556.73 E:0.064230 |  where the suspicion was last night that he might play.
[6149.00 - 6150.00] P:1643.95 E:0.056289 |  That's where he's going.
[6150.00 - 6152.00] P:1722.44 E:0.061009 |  Yeah, it looks like it.
[6152.00 - 6154.00] P:1784.65 E:0.064729 |  He's not going alongside Drogba.
[6154.00 - 6156.00] P:1791.09 E:0.065323 |  Steve Bruce, what are your thoughts?
[6157.00 - 6159.00] P:1788.75 E:0.075274 |  Well, I think you've got to make sure that you put Torres
[6159.00 - 6160.00] P:1817.70 E:0.072136 |  up the top end of the pitch,
[6160.00 - 6163.00] P:1702.62 E:0.065665 |  and you've got to go for it now with six, seven minutes to go.
[6163.00 - 6164.00] P:1691.78 E:0.068890 |  Put him up through the middle,
[6164.00 - 6166.00] P:1835.25 E:0.065963 |  so it's going to be quite comfortable,
[6166.00 - 6168.00] P:1900.90 E:0.059393 |  and maybe he's going to spark a chance.
[6168.00 - 6170.00] P:1856.63 E:0.053281 |  Let's hope he goes and plays there.
[6170.00 - 6172.00] P:1712.03 E:0.067061 |  Oh, that's a good header by Müller.
[6172.00 - 6174.00] P:1569.70 E:0.058593 |  Finding Robin into the penalty.
[6174.00 - 6176.00] P:1552.26 E:0.062943 |  Robin should be hitting it more forcefully.
[6176.00 - 6178.00] P:1689.48 E:0.053887 |  It might have beaten Czech for Czech saves.
[6178.00 - 6179.00] P:1711.00 E:0.050689 |  It's a half-time.
[6179.00 - 6180.00] P:1687.93 E:0.046684 |  I'm with Steve.
[6180.00 - 6182.00] P:1643.05 E:0.063301 |  You may as well lose two,
[6182.00 - 6184.00] P:1688.30 E:0.058397 |  and he'll try to get a 1-1 draw, might you?
[6184.00 - 6185.00] P:1652.15 E:0.076033 |  Well, Torres has gone in nine.
[6185.00 - 6187.00] P:1548.63 E:0.055847 |  Drogba's header on, just ahead of the Spaniard,
[6187.00 - 6190.00] P:1376.32 E:0.050378 |  and it's behind for a goal kick.
[6190.00 - 6192.00] P:1743.85 E:0.049276 |  Well, unfortunately, that number for 6-0-6
[6192.00 - 6194.00] P:1690.35 E:0.064697 |  might be more relevant sooner than later.
[6194.00 - 6197.00] P:1717.58 E:0.049136 |  0-599-693.
[6198.00 - 6200.00] P:1699.29 E:0.043940 |  I don't think Czech had any chance at the goal.
[6200.00 - 6201.00] P:1734.94 E:0.039217 |  No.
[6201.00 - 6202.00] P:1533.58 E:0.035166 |  Really don't.
[6202.00 - 6204.00] P:1605.20 E:0.042089 |  No, but it is.
[6204.00 - 6207.00] P:1568.73 E:0.056459 |  Gomez and Asikov sort of ran into each other,
[6207.00 - 6210.00] P:1641.80 E:0.067295 |  and Asikov had to come in and try and mark him.
[6210.00 - 6212.00] P:1545.68 E:0.061130 |  He just left Müller with a free header,
[6212.00 - 6213.00] P:1612.65 E:0.070097 |  and he did the right thing,
[6213.00 - 6216.00] P:1521.07 E:0.060695 |  which was heading down from that angle.
[6216.00 - 6218.00] P:1492.24 E:0.055841 |  Five minutes left for play here
[6218.00 - 6221.00] P:1445.93 E:0.064350 |  on five live the World Service in BBC London.
[6221.00 - 6223.00] P:1527.75 E:0.047551 |  Can Chelsea get back into this final?
[6223.00 - 6225.00] P:1518.97 E:0.064800 |  Or will Bayern Munich score again?
[6225.00 - 6227.00] P:1504.40 E:0.049244 |  It's with Robin.
[6227.00 - 6228.00] P:1614.20 E:0.064030 |  Louise comes across.
[6228.00 - 6230.00] P:1595.48 E:0.075342 |  Robin holds him off, and then Louise just acts in his angle.
[6230.00 - 6232.00] P:1701.73 E:0.065956 |  He's going to be booked.
[6232.00 - 6233.00] P:1801.50 E:0.066758 |  And rightly so.
[6233.00 - 6235.00] P:1798.92 E:0.062332 |  Now, what does Rubri do?
[6235.00 - 6237.00] P:1892.85 E:0.064743 |  Rubri's going over to complain to Louise.
[6237.00 - 6238.00] P:1927.82 E:0.058821 |  None of his business.
[6238.00 - 6240.00] P:1829.37 E:0.061410 |  He's run 40 yards to complain.
[6240.00 - 6242.00] P:1734.51 E:0.039628 |  No, no, no. Go away, little boy.
[6242.00 - 6244.00] P:1642.64 E:0.049865 |  No way. Nothing to do with you.
[6244.00 - 6246.00] P:1597.34 E:0.056170 |  Robin's making the most of it as well.
[6246.00 - 6248.00] P:1615.58 E:0.048782 |  No, no. Not like Arjen.
[6248.00 - 6250.00] P:1541.05 E:0.060825 |  No one's going to see that, do they?
[6250.00 - 6252.00] P:1409.34 E:0.064357 |  Well, he's on his feet.
[6252.00 - 6254.00] P:1418.76 E:0.057786 |  That's another booking
[6254.00 - 6256.00] P:1593.34 E:0.055836 |  for Chelsea.
[6256.00 - 6259.00] P:1773.37 E:0.055202 |  Unfortunately, it's the scoreline that counts most.
[6259.00 - 6262.00] P:1609.25 E:0.053856 |  It's 1-0 to Bayern Munich.
[6262.00 - 6264.00] P:1388.73 E:0.058315 |  And Bayern are going to make a change.
[6264.00 - 6266.00] P:1641.08 E:0.058721 |  Van Boijten is coming on,
[6266.00 - 6268.00] P:1391.04 E:0.068858 |  and Muller, the goal scorer,
[6268.00 - 6271.00] P:1696.31 E:0.057601 |  is coming off, and that's a clear defensive change
[6271.00 - 6272.00] P:1684.43 E:0.063123 |  by Eupankis.
[6272.00 - 6275.00] P:1632.15 E:0.059991 |  Right, just sell the game up. Why not?
[6275.00 - 6278.00] P:1598.00 E:0.066434 |  Well, it's a glory moment
[6278.00 - 6280.00] P:1754.64 E:0.056940 |  for Thomas Muller.
[6280.00 - 6283.00] P:1833.90 E:0.067186 |  Muller takes the applause of two-thirds of the stadium.
[6283.00 - 6285.00] P:1739.68 E:0.059288 |  That's how heavily Bayern fans
[6285.00 - 6287.00] P:1652.43 E:0.061918 |  like number Chelsea supporters
[6287.00 - 6289.00] P:1727.94 E:0.066357 |  inside the Allianz Arena.
[6289.00 - 6291.00] P:1670.14 E:0.061195 |  And they're four minutes away
[6291.00 - 6293.00] P:1835.22 E:0.048248 |  from their fifth European Cup
[6293.00 - 6295.00] P:1747.70 E:0.060639 |  Stoke Champions League triumph.
[6295.00 - 6297.00] P:1852.36 E:0.032712 |  They've got a free kick.
[6297.00 - 6299.00] P:1856.96 E:0.053061 |  Yeah, I think Van Boijten will just go
[6299.00 - 6301.00] P:1657.18 E:0.061161 |  sixth central midfield.
[6301.00 - 6303.00] P:1303.81 E:0.059001 |  And then you might even try and take
[6303.00 - 6305.00] P:1681.56 E:0.061320 |  drug with them. The long balls
[6305.00 - 6308.00] P:1541.13 E:0.060406 |  put forward, and Timershick and the other guy
[6308.00 - 6310.00] P:1629.41 E:0.044917 |  will just drop off.
[6310.00 - 6312.00] P:1685.61 E:0.038344 |  Robin, in no decruse.
[6312.00 - 6314.00] P:1446.69 E:0.055873 |  Why do Robin again?
[6314.00 - 6316.00] P:1402.22 E:0.049167 |  And now, Rubri takes it up.
[6316.00 - 6318.00] P:1529.91 E:0.054761 |  Rubri gets past Ashley Cole.
[6318.00 - 6320.00] P:1483.51 E:0.054373 |  Rubri should have out-balled across the goal line.
[6320.00 - 6322.00] P:1616.01 E:0.059358 |  That should have been a goal kick.
[6322.00 - 6324.00] P:1715.35 E:0.065455 |  Look at the extra assist in there.
[6324.00 - 6326.00] P:1588.51 E:0.064575 |  He's all of a yard away.
[6326.00 - 6328.00] P:1702.17 E:0.049464 |  They're not allowed to move, have you not heard?
[6328.00 - 6330.00] P:1851.89 E:0.067782 |  No, seriously, they're not. They're just for the uniforms.
[6330.00 - 6332.00] P:1749.36 E:0.043931 |  You're not even allowed to pick your nose or scratch your ear.
[6332.00 - 6333.00] P:1354.85 E:0.046092 |  Absolutely ridiculous.
[6333.00 - 6335.00] P:1539.69 E:0.036259 |  What other match for you for this?
[6335.00 - 6337.00] P:1304.60 E:0.051456 |  He ain't done anything.
[6337.00 - 6339.00] P:1107.02 E:0.044916 |  And missed that.
[6339.00 - 6341.00] P:1185.64 E:0.061540 |  And now, he's going to go.
[6341.00 - 6343.00] P:1554.97 E:0.057058 |  Before whatever time will be added on
[6343.00 - 6345.00] P:1536.36 E:0.060493 |  for stoppages and substitutions.
[6345.00 - 6347.00] P:1337.90 E:0.063067 |  Balls out of play on the far side of the field.
[6347.00 - 6349.00] P:1555.63 E:0.055382 |  It's a Chelsea throw-in.
[6349.00 - 6351.00] P:1581.43 E:0.058823 |  They can't get Torres the substitute
[6351.00 - 6353.00] P:1517.34 E:0.062078 |  into the action at the moment.
[6353.00 - 6355.00] P:1615.71 E:0.063929 |  Van Munich lead Chelsea 1-0.
[6355.00 - 6357.00] P:1678.45 E:0.060636 |  And it has to be said, Mark, they deserve it.
[6357.00 - 6359.00] P:1743.87 E:0.058160 |  They do the better team.
[6359.00 - 6361.00] P:1692.63 E:0.037480 |  There's no argument.
[6361.00 - 6363.00] P:1682.43 E:0.059037 |  Matter. On to Torres on the far side of the field.
[6363.00 - 6365.00] P:1709.92 E:0.042427 |  Torres, face back in 10-0.
[6365.00 - 6367.00] P:1580.93 E:0.062065 |  Torres goes down, right in front of the assistant.
[6367.00 - 6368.00] P:1354.66 E:0.046409 |  Corner.
[6368.00 - 6371.00] P:1405.37 E:0.049502 |  And that was a dive, but he's got a corner, has he?
[6371.00 - 6372.00] P:1658.47 E:0.035755 |  Yes.
[6372.00 - 6374.00] P:1588.19 E:0.058619 |  Don't take it. Get in the box.
[6374.00 - 6375.00] P:1358.00 E:0.026711 |  What are you doing?
[6375.00 - 6377.00] P:1496.82 E:0.063261 |  Come on, Fernanda. You get into the penalty area.
[6377.00 - 6379.00] P:1417.17 E:0.049567 |  Leave matter to take the corner.
[6379.00 - 6381.00] P:1656.84 E:0.067804 |  Right, Louise is up there. So to his kale.
[6381.00 - 6382.00] P:1675.21 E:0.067496 |  First corner.
[6382.00 - 6383.00] P:1584.69 E:0.049809 |  Two and a half minutes to go.
[6383.00 - 6385.00] P:1635.31 E:0.047525 |  Chelsea's first corner of the game.
[6385.00 - 6387.00] P:1568.97 E:0.044968 |  That's a remarkable statistic.
[6387.00 - 6389.00] P:1582.60 E:0.042120 |  Matter has to wait.
[6389.00 - 6391.00] P:1611.81 E:0.053624 |  There's some pushing inside the penalty area.
[6391.00 - 6393.00] P:1557.81 E:0.057389 |  Van just want to close out the first here.
[6393.00 - 6395.00] P:1562.79 E:0.055624 |  Inside their own stadium.
[6395.00 - 6397.00] P:1532.51 E:0.053290 |  Matter. Left foot into the near post.
[6397.00 - 6399.00] P:1712.18 E:0.076092 |  Drunk wall ahead.
[6399.00 - 6401.00] P:1666.91 E:0.075213 |  Bridget Haddon by Gidea Gromfam.
[6401.00 - 6403.00] P:1557.53 E:0.072705 |  Fantastic effort.
[6403.00 - 6405.00] P:1575.19 E:0.073449 |  And we're heading for extra time.
[6405.00 - 6407.00] P:1558.97 E:0.076436 |  Told you to get a chance.
[6407.00 - 6409.00] P:1501.17 E:0.074234 |  Bridget Haddon.
[6409.00 - 6410.00] P:1346.26 E:0.083332 |  Absolutely brilliant.
[6410.00 - 6413.00] P:1470.46 E:0.076356 |  It was almost past Neuer in the Munich goal.
[6413.00 - 6416.00] P:1556.59 E:0.076270 |  Before he got a hand to it, he just could prevent it going in.
[6416.00 - 6418.00] P:1417.79 E:0.069136 |  Great, Haddon.
[6418.00 - 6421.00] P:1457.47 E:0.071151 |  Call us to 6-0-6. Just hang far for a moment.
[6421.00 - 6423.00] P:1336.05 E:0.064900 |  Just hang far.
[6423.00 - 6427.00] P:1410.04 E:0.071512 |  0-599-6-93. What a great header from Drogba.
[6427.00 - 6429.00] P:1556.89 E:0.063639 |  He made up some ground, Alan, as well.
[6429.00 - 6431.00] P:1493.18 E:0.068235 |  Goodness gracious.
[6431.00 - 6433.00] P:1475.29 E:0.064652 |  It's probably his final game for Chelsea.
[6433.00 - 6435.00] P:1490.71 E:0.065337 |  And he scores his 34th Champions League goal.
[6435.00 - 6437.00] P:1451.73 E:0.061174 |  It was unstoppable.
[6437.00 - 6439.00] P:1459.02 E:0.053528 |  I just wonder...
[6439.00 - 6441.00] P:1468.02 E:0.067039 |  ...Beyen had had somebody on the post.
[6441.00 - 6444.00] P:1608.67 E:0.060204 |  Whether they would have naturally come out and headed that away.
[6445.00 - 6447.00] P:1454.90 E:0.054993 |  And now my game takes a first.
[6447.00 - 6451.00] P:1583.83 E:0.058433 |  He did his own hands by telling a clock in the front to sit down.
[6451.00 - 6453.00] P:1605.37 E:0.054678 |  He's over this camera, you know.
[6453.00 - 6455.00] P:1717.47 E:0.056010 |  Goodness gracious.
[6455.00 - 6457.00] P:1739.99 E:0.064426 |  We've got a minute to go.
[6457.00 - 6459.00] P:1600.03 E:0.048516 |  Before and at a time.
[6459.00 - 6461.00] P:1685.63 E:0.047495 |  And it's 1-1.
[6461.00 - 6463.00] P:1771.69 E:0.075050 |  Well done, Chelsea.
[6463.00 - 6465.00] P:1715.00 E:0.050918 |  Well, the other thing as well, Alan, don't forget...
[6465.00 - 6467.00] P:1725.92 E:0.073493 |  ...Munich made the change to close the game up.
[6467.00 - 6471.00] P:1663.33 E:0.065206 |  So they now got Van Bitenen there in central midfield.
[6471.00 - 6473.00] P:1704.31 E:0.063058 |  Yep, and he's got his goal scorer.
[6473.00 - 6475.00] P:1831.16 E:0.050896 |  In fact, he's dropped back in, is he?
[6475.00 - 6477.00] P:1622.80 E:0.028166 |  Wow.
[6477.00 - 6479.00] P:1780.48 E:0.065777 |  This is... Timershoek...
[6479.00 - 6481.00] P:1536.26 E:0.061506 |  ...is one of the most...
[6481.00 - 6483.00] P:1632.71 E:0.047120 |  Van Biten's dropped in there.
[6483.00 - 6485.00] P:1683.93 E:0.056317 |  Rivery gives the ball away to Torres.
[6485.00 - 6487.00] P:1701.42 E:0.060742 |  Can Chelsea possibly find a winner?
[6487.00 - 6489.00] P:1639.59 E:0.055204 |  It's hitting the direction of Drogba.
[6489.00 - 6491.00] P:1603.27 E:0.054184 |  Drogba takes the ball on his right thigh,
[6491.00 - 6494.00] P:1446.62 E:0.050561 |  but unfortunately, Laam was there to help out Van Buiten.
[6494.00 - 6497.00] P:1406.10 E:0.041862 |  Van Buiten now finds Bote.
[6497.00 - 6499.00] P:1567.82 E:0.055664 |  And went out to Timershoek.
[6499.00 - 6501.00] P:1575.03 E:0.051603 |  I wonder if any Chelsea punters left.
[6501.00 - 6503.00] P:1429.26 E:0.060031 |  I hope not.
[6503.00 - 6505.00] P:1509.40 E:0.058056 |  I hope not. Laam's on the halfway line.
[6505.00 - 6507.00] P:1442.01 E:0.050837 |  Surely it's extra time now.
[6507.00 - 6510.00] P:1503.05 E:0.052862 |  But after what happened at the Etihad the other Sunday,
[6510.00 - 6512.00] P:1626.19 E:0.060257 |  anything is possible.
[6512.00 - 6515.00] P:1610.53 E:0.068202 |  So Chelsea score from the first corner of the game.
[6515.00 - 6517.00] P:1485.86 E:0.045630 |  Robin onto Laam.
[6517.00 - 6520.00] P:1552.11 E:0.053902 |  Laam flicks it to the right side in Cruz.
[6520.00 - 6522.00] P:1658.83 E:0.053728 |  Baron on the attack. Cruz, edge of the Chelsea penalty.
[6522.00 - 6524.00] P:1734.23 E:0.048442 |  Dicks the cross in.
[6524.00 - 6525.00] P:1588.13 E:0.048253 |  Luis heads it up.
[6525.00 - 6528.00] P:1589.55 E:0.054839 |  Rivery heads it down, and Luis smashes it upfield.
[6528.00 - 6530.00] P:1528.67 E:0.047106 |  Good control by Bote.
[6530.00 - 6532.00] P:1556.32 E:0.053172 |  We've got three minutes of added time.
[6532.00 - 6534.00] P:1591.39 E:0.060221 |  It's 1-1.
[6534.00 - 6536.00] P:1684.53 E:0.058408 |  And here's Robin into the Chelsea penalty.
[6536.00 - 6539.00] P:1656.99 E:0.055546 |  It should take some reflection and runs his way towards the corner.
[6539.00 - 6541.00] P:1850.85 E:0.050055 |  A little half chance that was, you know,
[6541.00 - 6544.00] P:1804.32 E:0.059100 |  and yet again another good block by one of the Chelsea defenders.
[6546.00 - 6549.00] P:1902.71 E:0.039388 |  Don't you just love the drama?
[6549.00 - 6553.00] P:1808.15 E:0.044075 |  Cruz to take the corner for Bayern Munich.
[6553.00 - 6555.00] P:1793.13 E:0.050871 |  Stung by Drogba's equaliser.
[6555.00 - 6558.00] P:1474.38 E:0.044399 |  Cruz from the right, plays it in deep.
[6558.00 - 6561.00] P:1600.97 E:0.050093 |  It was actually Schweinsteiger who ran to meet the header,
[6561.00 - 6563.00] P:1505.67 E:0.053199 |  but the ball cleared to Torres.
[6563.00 - 6566.00] P:1613.77 E:0.064614 |  Torres was fouled there and it's a free kick to Chelsea.
[6566.00 - 6569.00] P:1739.42 E:0.045285 |  Yeah, he's just taken out, wasn't it?
[6569.00 - 6572.00] P:1673.95 E:0.044677 |  That's why he just loved the game, though, isn't it?
[6572.00 - 6574.00] P:1488.38 E:0.056264 |  That's when you think it's over.
[6574.00 - 6577.00] P:1579.28 E:0.060025 |  I did. I just didn't see Chelsea getting back into it.
[6577.00 - 6579.00] P:1524.42 E:0.065493 |  Just had this feeling, Drogba would get a chance.
[6579.00 - 6581.00] P:1182.53 E:0.061477 |  I think he's written.
[6581.00 - 6583.00] P:1364.07 E:0.073483 |  And didn't he take it brilliantly?
[6583.00 - 6585.00] P:1396.89 E:0.064381 |  Didn't he take it brilliantly?
[6585.00 - 6587.00] P:1455.14 E:0.064067 |  The man for the occasion, Digné Drogba.
[6587.00 - 6589.00] P:1590.27 E:0.070888 |  It always is.
[6590.00 - 6592.00] P:1324.72 E:0.069383 |  Two minutes of added time remaining.
[6592.00 - 6595.00] P:1238.33 E:0.067099 |  Before we're into 30 minutes of extra time.
[6595.00 - 6597.00] P:1352.58 E:0.062062 |  Checks free kick to Miquel,
[6597.00 - 6599.00] P:1195.04 E:0.070749 |  who with Lampard has been immense.
[6599.00 - 6601.00] P:1661.32 E:0.058956 |  Forward it goes to Torres.
[6601.00 - 6603.00] P:1338.39 E:0.055513 |  Torres chess in fact of a single.
[6603.00 - 6605.00] P:1515.90 E:0.064012 |  Drogba reach for the cross, played in towards Drogba,
[6605.00 - 6607.00] P:1264.34 E:0.055279 |  cleared by Van Boijten.
[6607.00 - 6610.00] P:1614.19 E:0.065961 |  He holds his faces if he's got a smack from Digné Drogba.
[6610.00 - 6612.00] P:1634.45 E:0.059438 |  Excited play, it's going to be a Chelsea throw-in.
[6612.00 - 6614.00] P:1535.46 E:0.041650 |  I think he did accidental there.
[6615.00 - 6618.00] P:1586.30 E:0.058435 |  Come on, Chelsea. Are we asking Tim Wunsch to get a winner?
[6618.00 - 6621.00] P:1453.24 E:0.052184 |  90 seconds of added time remaining.
[6621.00 - 6623.00] P:1432.73 E:0.047577 |  Bersingua with the throw-in.
[6623.00 - 6626.00] P:1543.29 E:0.044458 |  It goes short to Torres.
[6626.00 - 6628.00] P:1749.26 E:0.048315 |  Torres tried to get it past,
[6628.00 - 6631.00] P:1643.91 E:0.051722 |  but he didn't and it should be cleared now by Schweinsteiger.
[6631.00 - 6634.00] P:1422.70 E:0.065539 |  Schweinsteiger running off field, runs into Miquel.
[6634.00 - 6636.00] P:1408.93 E:0.064101 |  Miquel crosses in towards Drogba.
[6636.00 - 6638.00] P:1419.44 E:0.061459 |  Neuer decides to punch and punches well.
[6638.00 - 6640.00] P:1414.22 E:0.062021 |  Cole hits it back.
[6640.00 - 6642.00] P:1407.63 E:0.053277 |  Here's Matta. Matta with a minute to go.
[6642.00 - 6644.00] P:1353.73 E:0.057679 |  In Munich, one goal each.
[6644.00 - 6646.00] P:1485.96 E:0.061219 |  Spahn, Munich and Chelsea.
[6646.00 - 6648.00] P:1394.74 E:0.053953 |  Lampard has the ball for Chelsea.
[6648.00 - 6650.00] P:1425.66 E:0.049810 |  Back to Miquel. Matta again.
[6650.00 - 6654.00] P:1431.33 E:0.054115 |  Lampard's rarely in a forward position in this final.
[6654.00 - 6656.00] P:1408.84 E:0.055803 |  He's up on the edge of the penalty.
[6656.00 - 6658.00] P:1234.65 E:0.059658 |  Drogba tried to lay the ball back to Matta,
[6658.00 - 6662.00] P:1374.25 E:0.063025 |  but it slashed away to safety by Neuer up over the half way line.
[6662.00 - 6666.00] P:1448.39 E:0.047939 |  Czech is there. 40 seconds of added time remaining.
[6666.00 - 6668.00] P:1326.57 E:0.054934 |  Czech to Kehl.
[6668.00 - 6670.00] P:1364.35 E:0.066897 |  Bayern are worried by conceding a winner.
[6670.00 - 6672.00] P:1472.99 E:0.065630 |  He can tell from their body language.
[6672.00 - 6674.00] P:1388.57 E:0.066597 |  Alan, you may as well lump it up forward here.
[6674.00 - 6675.00] P:1398.71 E:0.057903 |  You never know.
[6675.00 - 6678.00] P:1337.53 E:0.050986 |  Kehl to Miquel.
[6678.00 - 6681.00] P:1400.36 E:0.055448 |  25 seconds of added time remaining.
[6681.00 - 6683.00] P:1639.97 E:0.061075 |  Drogba just wants it played in his direction.
[6683.00 - 6686.00] P:1388.15 E:0.047765 |  It goes to Torres. Torres back to Bersingua.
[6686.00 - 6688.00] P:1380.42 E:0.058909 |  Bersingua now thinks about Drogba.
[6688.00 - 6690.00] P:1446.92 E:0.054584 |  Plays it in towards Dider Drogba,
[6690.00 - 6692.00] P:1503.44 E:0.057559 |  who chests it back brilliantly to Matta on the Drogba again.
[6692.00 - 6694.00] P:1431.40 E:0.060893 |  Good header by Drogba to Louise.
[6694.00 - 6696.00] P:1630.71 E:0.062131 |  Louise steps inside Robin.
[6696.00 - 6698.00] P:1568.09 E:0.061600 |  One last chance for Chelsea.
[6698.00 - 6700.00] P:1465.48 E:0.057459 |  One last attack from the London side.
[6700.00 - 6702.00] P:1387.65 E:0.057848 |  Cole into Lampard.
[6702.00 - 6704.00] P:1426.58 E:0.060999 |  Matta's available. Matta steps away from...
[6704.00 - 6706.00] P:1406.14 E:0.078639 |  3-0.
[6706.00 - 6709.00] P:1514.53 E:0.062225 |  Every 3-kick to Chelsea.
[6709.00 - 6712.00] P:1640.19 E:0.073177 |  30 yards from Cole. Not even 30 yards from Cole.
[6712.00 - 6714.00] P:1376.50 E:0.046274 |  25 yards from Cole.
[6715.00 - 6717.00] P:1542.70 E:0.058201 |  Give it to Frank.
[6717.00 - 6719.00] P:1451.04 E:0.060759 |  Question is who takes this now.
[6719.00 - 6721.00] P:1379.40 E:0.054496 |  Lampard wants it, but Drogba's taking it off him.
[6721.00 - 6723.00] P:1456.73 E:0.053435 |  Well, Drogba hasn't taken one, has he?
[6723.00 - 6726.00] P:1405.02 E:0.063706 |  Matta took the one in the first half, so it's obviously his turn.
[6726.00 - 6729.00] P:1352.77 E:0.068370 |  Cricky, what a story that would be if he smashes this in the 2nd.
[6729.00 - 6732.00] P:1351.11 E:0.066158 |  We've had our three minutes of added time.
[6732.00 - 6734.00] P:1469.01 E:0.056838 |  This is extra added time
[6734.00 - 6737.00] P:1361.82 E:0.058536 |  being added on by the Portuguese referee.
[6737.00 - 6740.00] P:1446.38 E:0.061048 |  I think the best barn can hope for now is extra time.
[6740.00 - 6744.00] P:1421.13 E:0.051094 |  But Chelsea can search for a dramatic winner.
[6744.00 - 6747.00] P:1351.36 E:0.057005 |  After the 3-kick, there'll be no time left.
[6748.00 - 6752.00] P:1308.81 E:0.067605 |  Right, it's pushed away a bit further away from the penalty area.
[6753.00 - 6755.00] P:1357.50 E:0.064308 |  Matta moves clear.
[6755.00 - 6758.00] P:1251.21 E:0.068165 |  It will be left to Diedre Drogba.
[6758.00 - 6760.00] P:1441.85 E:0.057990 |  Score of the headed equaliser
[6760.00 - 6763.00] P:1398.35 E:0.055488 |  as time ran out for Chelsea here in Munich.
[6764.00 - 6766.00] P:1532.68 E:0.059529 |  Drogba standing close to the ball.
[6766.00 - 6768.00] P:1587.37 E:0.049224 |  He'll back off very shortly.
[6768.00 - 6770.00] P:1743.24 E:0.054089 |  Just three or four paces.
[6770.00 - 6772.00] P:1488.39 E:0.046260 |  And Neuer beware.
[6772.00 - 6774.00] P:1582.41 E:0.050560 |  Drogba, not much of a run-up at all.
[6774.00 - 6777.00] P:1620.13 E:0.063810 |  Here he comes and shoots wildly over the crossbar.
[6777.00 - 6779.00] P:1537.40 E:0.046807 |  What are the left down?
[6779.00 - 6782.00] P:1708.11 E:0.061369 |  And it's full time, and we've got 30 minutes of extra time.
[6782.00 - 6784.00] P:1786.59 E:0.044551 |  My goodness.
[6784.00 - 6785.00] P:1659.76 E:0.063612 |  Mark.
[6785.00 - 6787.00] P:1731.77 E:0.054685 |  That's unbelievable, Alan.
[6787.00 - 6790.00] P:1819.78 E:0.054974 |  When you consider how late through Muller that Bayern scored,
[6790.00 - 6793.00] P:1795.64 E:0.051694 |  they then made the change to show the game up from Chelsea's first
[6793.00 - 6795.00] P:1739.08 E:0.055636 |  and only corner by that stage of the game.
[6795.00 - 6798.00] P:1634.94 E:0.055187 |  A great run and late by Drogba.
[6798.00 - 6799.00] P:1880.51 E:0.064254 |  Unstoppable header.
[6799.00 - 6801.00] P:1870.48 E:0.053496 |  Chelsea very much back in this game now.
[6801.00 - 6804.00] P:1763.91 E:0.053591 |  Don't forget, there will be a 6-0-6.
[6804.00 - 6807.00] P:1935.35 E:0.048981 |  Eventually, but we have got extra time here in Munich
[6807.00 - 6809.00] P:1866.50 E:0.047628 |  and possibly penalties.
[6809.00 - 6811.00] P:1848.63 E:0.050723 |  At the end of 90 minutes, it's finished.
[6811.00 - 6813.00] P:1965.91 E:0.059423 |  Bayern Munich won. Chelsea won.
[6813.00 - 6815.00] P:2060.18 E:0.067566 |  Steve, I sent you for 80 minutes.
[6815.00 - 6817.00] P:1845.45 E:0.062429 |  It wasn't exciting, but it was gripping and absorbing.
[6817.00 - 6819.00] P:2039.44 E:0.052604 |  And then the last 10 minutes, exciting.
[6819.00 - 6822.00] P:1869.58 E:0.057814 |  Muller heads, Bayern into a lead in the 83rd minute.
[6822.00 - 6824.00] P:1713.90 E:0.063138 |  And then from their first corner, Drogba.
[6824.00 - 6828.00] P:1563.49 E:0.056638 |  We said earlier today, he always plays incredibly well at Wembley.
[6828.00 - 6830.00] P:1712.78 E:0.063728 |  Sometimes on this stage, he's let them down a little bit,
[6830.00 - 6831.00] P:1739.29 E:0.058191 |  not with that header.
[6831.00 - 6834.00] P:1558.80 E:0.060289 |  What a big player and a big cage in this Foller is.
[6834.00 - 6838.00] P:1550.33 E:0.060941 |  I mean, he's been for seven, eight, nine years now in the Premier League.
[6838.00 - 6842.00] P:1812.45 E:0.052557 |  The outstanding centre forward of the English-British style, if you like.
[6842.00 - 6845.00] P:1541.72 E:0.055903 |  He's thunked a header into the top corner,
[6845.00 - 6847.00] P:1714.94 E:0.059501 |  and it was a wonderful, wonderful header.
[6847.00 - 6850.00] P:1821.26 E:0.062371 |  It's the first time Chelsea have really gone on the outside of them.
[6850.00 - 6853.00] P:1628.34 E:0.054668 |  Torres is forced to corner, first corner of the game.
[6853.00 - 6855.00] P:1727.88 E:0.044215 |  He's got past his marker, Boateng.
[6855.00 - 6859.00] P:1707.20 E:0.044162 |  And for me now, there's a big gamble gone on by the German coach, Enckus,
[6859.00 - 6862.00] P:1718.05 E:0.045882 |  because he's brought Van Boijten on for the last four, five minutes,
[6862.00 - 6864.00] P:1719.87 E:0.043118 |  who hasn't played since last January.
[6864.00 - 6867.00] P:1553.78 E:0.043336 |  Now, he must be fit enough, however,
[6867.00 - 6871.00] P:1678.34 E:0.042919 |  he's got to get through 30 minutes for the first time in five months,
[6871.00 - 6873.00] P:1721.40 E:0.044630 |  which is a big, big call,
[6873.00 - 6876.00] P:1938.47 E:0.047760 |  and could be that just the Chelsea swing that we need.
[6876.00 - 6879.00] P:1938.77 E:0.059359 |  They've been far more positive when Torres has come on,
[6879.00 - 6881.00] P:1959.85 E:0.056317 |  and now it's a cup final.
[6881.00 - 6885.00] P:1932.94 E:0.054994 |  They must try and go for it now, not sit back like they've done for 70 minutes.
[6885.00 - 6887.00] P:1949.75 E:0.051160 |  It's here right now.
[6887.00 - 6890.00] P:1780.25 E:0.048024 |  Can they go and attack them and get something out of the game and win the trophy?
[6890.00 - 6893.00] P:1940.22 E:0.066911 |  Bayern were hanging on for the last three or four minutes, weren't they, having been in...
[6893.00 - 6896.00] P:1859.39 E:0.051312 |  Well, they were shocked when the goals gone in.
[6896.00 - 6899.00] P:1796.20 E:0.052375 |  As I said, you know, Luis has made a silly foul down here.
[6899.00 - 6901.00] P:1532.56 E:0.053276 |  We thought, well, that's the end of it.
[6901.00 - 6904.00] P:1527.60 E:0.048638 |  They get one little sniffed goal, and how often do we see it?
[6904.00 - 6907.00] P:1763.42 E:0.058713 |  This game, we've been in it for years and years and years.
[6907.00 - 6910.00] P:1649.85 E:0.045198 |  You see a wonderful, wonderful exhibition
[6910.00 - 6913.00] P:1610.00 E:0.040885 |  of what the last 10 minutes of a cup final can be.
[6913.00 - 6915.00] P:1960.08 E:0.063515 |  Mark, is the force with Chelsea here?
[6915.00 - 6917.00] P:1845.81 E:0.053887 |  Do Chelsea have them momentum?
[6917.00 - 6920.00] P:1671.75 E:0.048962 |  Definitely, and the spring will be in their legs now.
[6920.00 - 6922.00] P:1522.67 E:0.056930 |  There's no doubt about it.
[6922.00 - 6924.00] P:1575.61 E:0.056868 |  They were out, they were gone.
[6924.00 - 6926.00] P:1730.35 E:0.052347 |  It was all over, they were just finalists,
[6926.00 - 6928.00] P:1503.23 E:0.044042 |  and we're going to lift the trophy.
[6928.00 - 6932.00] P:1670.74 E:0.045521 |  So, most definitely, and the thing from Bayern's point of view,
[6932.00 - 6935.00] P:1808.85 E:0.052140 |  they're just a little bit fortunate that Timerschuk actually,
[6935.00 - 6938.00] P:1549.96 E:0.048688 |  the midfield player, can go in there and play.
[6938.00 - 6941.00] P:1402.15 E:0.047202 |  But the point Steve makes a bit about van Boijten,
[6941.00 - 6944.00] P:1696.95 E:0.053120 |  I mean, you'd be looking to stretch him at every available opportunity
[6944.00 - 6947.00] P:1453.84 E:0.052065 |  if you did hear Droegler and Fernando Torres, of course.
[6947.00 - 6949.00] P:1854.32 E:0.070528 |  Just watching Frank Ribbery, who's on the bench,
[6949.00 - 6952.00] P:1841.79 E:0.058077 |  he's taken his shirt off, I don't think there's any suggestion, necessarily,
[6952.00 - 6953.00] P:1798.07 E:0.062729 |  that he's been substituted.
[6953.00 - 6956.00] P:1762.74 E:0.064953 |  Now, David Luiz has been struggling with his hamstring injury, of course.
[6956.00 - 6958.00] P:1844.07 E:0.057663 |  I mean, 90 minutes will be tough, 120.
[6958.00 - 6960.00] P:1826.79 E:0.058901 |  Well, that's going to test.
[6960.00 - 6964.00] P:1780.26 E:0.056400 |  I have to say, in defence of Keahal and Luis, they've been fantastic,
[6964.00 - 6966.00] P:1850.08 E:0.054183 |  especially when they haven't played for five, six weeks.
[6966.00 - 6970.00] P:1871.62 E:0.053846 |  Let's hope that obviously the hamstring can last for the next 30 minutes.
[6970.00 - 6975.00] P:1877.57 E:0.050371 |  Luis, since the game's finished, has lay on the pitch,
[6975.00 - 6977.00] P:1963.33 E:0.050474 |  got unbelievable treatment to his leg.
[6977.00 - 6980.00] P:1823.00 E:0.048241 |  Let's hope he can stand up to it and lead the team forward.
[6980.00 - 6983.00] P:1956.14 E:0.064626 |  Two centre-halves here we've got with us in Stephen Mark Lawrence.
[6983.00 - 6987.00] P:1831.89 E:0.057144 |  And Steve, what were your thoughts on Berteng's defensive inadequacies,
[6987.00 - 6990.00] P:1858.90 E:0.058693 |  or otherwise, or did just Droegler get too good a run on him, too good a jump?
[6990.00 - 6993.00] P:1795.06 E:0.062650 |  Well, you know, for always, we say that the Germans are that meticulous
[6993.00 - 6997.00] P:1895.77 E:0.051484 |  in their approach to bring Van Boijten on, who's six-foot-five, six-foot-six,
[6997.00 - 7000.00] P:1906.05 E:0.056313 |  and Boiteng still stays with Droegler, you know?
[7000.00 - 7002.00] P:1974.04 E:0.046248 |  So I couldn't quite get that.
[7002.00 - 7004.00] P:1892.54 E:0.061263 |  I would have thought he'd brought Van Boijten on and said,
[7004.00 - 7006.00] P:2013.20 E:0.056148 |  listen, you go and manmark Droegler.
[7006.00 - 7009.00] P:1931.24 E:0.051957 |  He's the big threat. Go and put him out the game.
[7009.00 - 7011.00] P:1957.79 E:0.048594 |  They haven't Boiteng picked him up. He switched off.
[7011.00 - 7014.00] P:1947.21 E:0.048310 |  He got half a yard, and he's thumped ahead of him at the top corner.
[7014.00 - 7017.00] P:1915.75 E:0.064457 |  A shot of John Terry on the bench, and his orange tracks,
[7017.00 - 7020.00] P:1991.64 E:0.061962 |  with Iron Robin extremely animated in the Bayern Munich.
[7020.00 - 7024.00] P:1836.85 E:0.063743 |  Hardell looked really quite angry as well, so close to winning the Champions League
[7024.00 - 7027.00] P:1884.30 E:0.062664 |  against his former team. Thomas Müller absolutely crestfallen.
[7027.00 - 7030.00] P:1824.08 E:0.058740 |  He could see the headlines that he'd won the Champions League
[7030.00 - 7034.00] P:1606.27 E:0.059183 |  before Didier Droegler bulleted a header into the back of the net.
[7034.00 - 7036.00] P:1626.82 E:0.061047 |  Now, Frank Lampard, the captain on a night, of course,
[7036.00 - 7039.00] P:1792.55 E:0.064515 |  because they tossed the coin once again, is by the officials,
[7039.00 - 7043.00] P:1567.66 E:0.059331 |  and just waiting for the Bayern Munich skipper, Philipp Lahm,
[7043.00 - 7047.00] P:1634.38 E:0.055444 |  to come up and toss the coin and do their bit.
[7047.00 - 7049.00] P:1938.04 E:0.064013 |  So what are you thinking at the moment? You're Chelsea.
[7049.00 - 7052.00] P:1741.90 E:0.058668 |  You're saying to each other, we've got a real chance here.
[7052.00 - 7055.00] P:1739.04 E:0.069473 |  It's going to be interesting again of what they're going to do with Torres.
[7055.00 - 7058.00] P:1893.16 E:0.056131 |  Are they going to put Torres up the pitch with Droegler in the last half an hour,
[7058.00 - 7061.00] P:1733.25 E:0.050804 |  or are they going to put him to the right?
[7061.00 - 7064.00] P:1785.83 E:0.055908 |  It'll be interesting to see me personally,
[7064.00 - 7067.00] P:1691.88 E:0.052678 |  with half an hour to go now, to try and win a cup final.
[7067.00 - 7069.00] P:1810.09 E:0.056304 |  I would put Torres up there. He's fresh.
[7069.00 - 7073.00] P:1580.68 E:0.050051 |  Van Boiteng's just come on, and we've always had terrible problems.
[7073.00 - 7076.00] P:1390.69 E:0.046336 |  Let's see if we can go for it. It'll be interesting to see what they do.
[7076.00 - 7078.00] P:1518.92 E:0.059360 |  OK, here we go then.
[7078.00 - 7081.00] P:1592.30 E:0.055205 |  Extra time here on Five Lives Sport.
[7081.00 - 7084.00] P:1868.75 E:0.065438 |  It is what, 19 minutes to 11 local time here in Munich.
[7084.00 - 7085.00] P:1787.68 E:0.063251 |  We could have penalties.
[7085.00 - 7087.00] P:1806.40 E:0.051820 |  6-0-6, stand by your bets for that.
[7087.00 - 7090.00] P:1846.38 E:0.063829 |  0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3 with Alan.
[7090.00 - 7092.00] P:1794.57 E:0.054612 |  8-5-0-5-8 on the text.
[7092.00 - 7095.00] P:1818.57 E:0.049139 |  1-1 in Munich. Extra time, my king.
[7095.00 - 7098.00] P:1555.44 E:0.046148 |  Jupp Heinkers, the Bayern Munich coach,
[7098.00 - 7101.00] P:1634.50 E:0.053694 |  said on his press conference yesterday, he expected a storm of a drama.
[7101.00 - 7104.00] P:1467.46 E:0.053250 |  Well, eventually we got one,
[7104.00 - 7107.00] P:1583.16 E:0.053799 |  and we go back to the way the team started,
[7107.00 - 7109.00] P:1587.30 E:0.059131 |  with Bayern Munich playing from right to left
[7109.00 - 7112.00] P:1585.99 E:0.050016 |  for this first period of extra time.
[7112.00 - 7114.00] P:1651.30 E:0.066999 |  I don't think Chelsea really wanted that final whistle,
[7114.00 - 7116.00] P:1575.40 E:0.060705 |  because they definitely had the momentum with them.
[7116.00 - 7119.00] P:1527.26 E:0.054764 |  Two headers then, 83 minutes, Müller,
[7119.00 - 7121.00] P:1513.67 E:0.045867 |  88 minutes, Drogber.
[7121.00 - 7123.00] P:1642.98 E:0.063496 |  Drogber, of course, who disgraced himself the last time
[7123.00 - 7125.00] P:1612.42 E:0.051476 |  he played in a Champions League final,
[7125.00 - 7128.00] P:1549.28 E:0.052182 |  being sent off in Moscow against Manchester United.
[7128.00 - 7130.00] P:1558.72 E:0.070978 |  So away we go. Van Boiteng has come on, by the way.
[7130.00 - 7132.00] P:1635.51 E:0.061741 |  Does carry a goal threat himself
[7132.00 - 7135.00] P:1529.97 E:0.049760 |  if he goes down the other end with free kicks and stuff.
[7135.00 - 7138.00] P:1550.60 E:0.058300 |  But it's Bayern Munich going forward straight away.
[7138.00 - 7141.00] P:1518.53 E:0.051619 |  And Laum plays it down this near side to Contento.
[7141.00 - 7144.00] P:1497.01 E:0.066079 |  So we're into extra time, 30 minutes of extra time in Munich at 1-1.
[7144.00 - 7147.00] P:1434.87 E:0.057558 |  Torres, a bit late with the challenge on Rieberi,
[7147.00 - 7151.00] P:1395.54 E:0.047650 |  and Rieberi throws himself down theatrically and wins the free kick.
[7151.00 - 7155.00] P:1409.49 E:0.051635 |  And Bayern Munich just nudged it off from Schweinsteiger to Contento,
[7155.00 - 7158.00] P:1454.57 E:0.049474 |  and Schweinsteiger at walking pace now,
[7158.00 - 7161.00] P:1504.83 E:0.055575 |  trying to win a free kick, but Chelsea have it.
[7161.00 - 7163.00] P:1492.62 E:0.066873 |  A little shimmy from Torres,
[7163.00 - 7166.00] P:1551.62 E:0.068487 |  and he goes into the Bayern Munich half, cross-cum defenders.
[7166.00 - 7169.00] P:1568.47 E:0.059956 |  Torres needs support in the penalty area.
[7169.00 - 7172.00] P:1416.90 E:0.066842 |  Torres is in the penalty area, goes down under the challenge from Boiteng,
[7172.00 - 7175.00] P:1468.77 E:0.063958 |  gets back up on his feet again, and Bayern haven't cleared,
[7175.00 - 7177.00] P:1399.86 E:0.059691 |  and Lampard shot its defender.
[7177.00 - 7179.00] P:1354.36 E:0.060860 |  Bayern were all over the place there.
[7179.00 - 7181.00] P:1423.61 E:0.053498 |  Great work initially by Torres.
[7181.00 - 7184.00] P:1270.74 E:0.060414 |  Chelsea wants more. Lampard in midfield, back to Cole,
[7184.00 - 7187.00] P:1276.57 E:0.060212 |  and now Matta really does well to control that,
[7187.00 - 7190.00] P:1324.79 E:0.062097 |  and it's opening up down the right-hand side for Bersingwer.
[7190.00 - 7193.00] P:1455.87 E:0.065367 |  Bersingwer's ball in his two-nier Boiteng, but it drops to Matta.
[7193.00 - 7196.00] P:1483.59 E:0.062166 |  Matta's shot is charged down, hit it away by Laam,
[7196.00 - 7200.00] P:1248.09 E:0.059359 |  still a chance for Chelsea, back into midfield with Miquel,
[7200.00 - 7203.00] P:1424.27 E:0.062489 |  and Bayern Munich absolutely shell-shocked at the moment,
[7203.00 - 7207.00] P:1336.08 E:0.059397 |  but it's still 1-1, and Chelsea have the ball almost back on the halfway line,
[7207.00 - 7211.00] P:1397.95 E:0.064128 |  but they must know the signs are there that if they can go forward,
[7211.00 - 7214.00] P:1475.56 E:0.065382 |  they can win this cup. It's Gary Cahill at the back now,
[7214.00 - 7218.00] P:1463.65 E:0.061809 |  finding Miquel, Miquela Chelsea on the halfway line.
[7218.00 - 7222.00] P:1521.57 E:0.059442 |  Miquel to Drogba, who hit it far too quickly, back to Boiteng,
[7222.00 - 7225.00] P:1595.86 E:0.054917 |  but Chelsea are getting much more of the possession now.
[7225.00 - 7229.00] P:1264.77 E:0.056724 |  Bersingwer in field to the excellent Miquel, back again to Bersingwer.
[7229.00 - 7231.00] P:1216.91 E:0.065740 |  They're all pointing and helping each other,
[7231.00 - 7234.00] P:1467.65 E:0.063369 |  and he finds Louise now in plenty of space.
[7234.00 - 7239.00] P:1378.85 E:0.062454 |  Louise onto Lampard on the halfway line, Matta and Lampard together.
[7239.00 - 7244.00] P:1533.29 E:0.055062 |  Torres and Drogba wait in hope. Louise now shuffles forward.
[7245.00 - 7249.00] P:1401.59 E:0.058504 |  Louise brings the ball to the halfway line and then lifts it down the left-hand side.
[7249.00 - 7251.00] P:1264.70 E:0.050496 |  Oh, that's poor, that's too high for Cole.
[7251.00 - 7255.00] P:1393.29 E:0.046308 |  They've virtually had the ball, mate, for however long we started in extra time,
[7255.00 - 7260.00] P:1354.96 E:0.050440 |  certainly, we said before that very much that the flow is with Chelsea,
[7260.00 - 7262.00] P:1520.82 E:0.052814 |  and it started that way a second half.
[7262.00 - 7264.00] P:1450.27 E:0.068817 |  Bayern Munich have to lift themselves again,
[7264.00 - 7266.00] P:1529.63 E:0.063940 |  but of course they have great resilience this German side,
[7266.00 - 7270.00] P:1363.74 E:0.053284 |  and it's now Riebery near side, the Bayern Munich left.
[7270.00 - 7275.00] P:1122.22 E:0.048839 |  Riebery coming forward, players waiting to be given the ball.
[7275.00 - 7279.00] P:1452.62 E:0.054477 |  Timershock now, finding Contento, and now it's back with Tony Kruse once more.
[7279.00 - 7282.00] P:1507.77 E:0.061829 |  Edge of the area, Kruse's shot is charged down by Lampard.
[7282.00 - 7285.00] P:1498.62 E:0.056565 |  Chelsea haven't cleared it though yet, it's Contento once more.
[7285.00 - 7291.00] P:1416.11 E:0.063480 |  Chelsea have to defend well here, Riebery, no, where Riebery's won a penalty.
[7291.00 - 7293.00] P:1447.29 E:0.062950 |  Dropus, dropus.
[7294.00 - 7296.00] P:1353.57 E:0.050770 |  Has he?
[7296.00 - 7301.00] P:1334.81 E:0.062031 |  Yeah, dropus got the yellow as well, and it was Dropus' foul, of course,
[7301.00 - 7305.00] P:1199.82 E:0.056955 |  was it in Barcelona, I think, that brought the penalty for Messi,
[7305.00 - 7311.00] P:1372.50 E:0.056359 |  and of course Messi missed it, but here's Iron Robin against his former club.
[7311.00 - 7316.00] P:1514.50 E:0.051945 |  He clipped his right leg, he's just gone to play the ball, Riebery.
[7316.00 - 7320.00] P:1430.27 E:0.053383 |  Dropus caught him, there's no argument, Mike, whatsoever.
[7321.00 - 7326.00] P:1529.08 E:0.059608 |  Just when Chelsea seem to have unlimited possibilities in the game,
[7326.00 - 7332.00] P:1397.97 E:0.056484 |  Bayern Munich have won themselves a penalty, all the Chelsea fans are behind Pedecek's goal,
[7332.00 - 7335.00] P:1532.83 E:0.060242 |  and Robin is bouncing the ball, trying to calm himself down.
[7335.00 - 7338.00] P:1688.56 E:0.057146 |  Could this be for Chelsea? Another messy moment.
[7340.00 - 7344.00] P:1292.63 E:0.064382 |  Well, Robin, five years ago today, played his last game for Chelsea.
[7344.00 - 7349.00] P:1403.22 E:0.067887 |  He's in the FA Cup final against Manchester United, Riebery still receiving attention,
[7349.00 - 7355.00] P:1644.69 E:0.051107 |  and actually this is not helping his own player, because Robin is having to wait.
[7355.00 - 7359.00] P:1529.25 E:0.045432 |  No, it's not, but he is obviously injured.
[7359.00 - 7362.00] P:1530.18 E:0.042147 |  He's won his penalty, you get up if you weren't.
[7364.00 - 7367.00] P:1372.66 E:0.061290 |  The force, the momentum of the game was with Chelsea.
[7367.00 - 7371.00] P:1404.96 E:0.061888 |  Bayern Munich were going to have to lift themselves up, they thought they'd done enough.
[7371.00 - 7374.00] P:1591.38 E:0.060529 |  They thought that Muller's goal was going to carry them through.
[7375.00 - 7380.00] P:1658.93 E:0.061710 |  There's been some delay here for the injury to Frank Riebery, who's been taken off the field.
[7384.00 - 7388.00] P:1574.23 E:0.063047 |  Mikkel is holding the ball, and it seems reluctant to give it to Arjen Robin.
[7388.00 - 7389.00] P:1370.73 E:0.052060 |  Wouldn't you be?
[7389.00 - 7395.00] P:1346.47 E:0.054934 |  But now here comes the Dutchman, who had some good times at Chelsea under Jose Mourinho,
[7395.00 - 7400.00] P:1447.72 E:0.058137 |  but now he could break their hearts. He could break Roman Abramovich's hearts.
[7401.00 - 7403.00] P:1769.00 E:0.045330 |  Here we go with Arjen Robin.
[7403.00 - 7406.00] P:1682.73 E:0.059233 |  Is he going to bite the hand here that used to feed him?
[7406.00 - 7408.00] P:1691.69 E:0.055903 |  Arjen Robin against Pedecek.
[7408.00 - 7410.00] P:1652.04 E:0.064918 |  Robin...
[7410.00 - 7414.00] P:1656.73 E:0.067186 |  Say bycek, the ball comes out again, and Robin can't follow it up,
[7414.00 - 7419.00] P:1398.95 E:0.072367 |  andcek holds on, and Bayern miss them over, and it was a messy moment again.
[7421.00 - 7425.00] P:1369.01 E:0.069421 |  That's a good save, not a particularly good penalty, but listen, it's a great save,
[7425.00 - 7427.00] P:1381.52 E:0.066952 |  and you keep it up, doesn't matter.
[7427.00 - 7431.00] P:1329.59 E:0.072114 |  But now Chelsea have to focus once more, because Robin has the ball down the right-hand side,
[7431.00 - 7436.00] P:1403.71 E:0.070706 |  and Ashley Cole has to be careful, and Arjen Robin hits it over the bar into the Chelsea fans,
[7436.00 - 7439.00] P:1238.37 E:0.075476 |  and Bayern's night of frustration continues.
[7439.00 - 7441.00] P:1331.24 E:0.074911 |  It's still one-one in extra time.
[7441.00 - 7445.00] P:1440.27 E:0.068544 |  There was actually a poor penalty, and it seemed for a split second
[7445.00 - 7448.00] P:1445.41 E:0.062613 |  when the ball came back, Arpetit Schachtner.
[7448.00 - 7454.00] P:1449.34 E:0.066519 |  Robin might just get a second bite at the cherry, but he was up just quickly enough to claim the ball.
[7454.00 - 7458.00] P:1391.55 E:0.057212 |  I think also Chelsea will be relieved that the penalty wasn't at the other end as well,
[7458.00 - 7462.00] P:1380.59 E:0.074412 |  because all the Bayern fans there would have tried to suck that ball into the back of the net,
[7462.00 - 7465.00] P:1410.48 E:0.067061 |  and if we go to penalties, it will be interesting to see, of course,
[7465.00 - 7467.00] P:1427.55 E:0.062672 |  at which end the penalties will be taken.
[7467.00 - 7472.00] P:1303.99 E:0.063798 |  But we are having the drama now in this Champions League final.
[7472.00 - 7474.00] P:1463.98 E:0.066796 |  Robin has missed his penalty.
[7474.00 - 7477.00] P:1374.09 E:0.065214 |  Robin now looking for Gomez, he's throws himself down looking for the free kick.
[7477.00 - 7481.00] P:1481.44 E:0.068750 |  Remember, Didier Drogba got a yellow card, and he's got a yellow card.
[7481.00 - 7487.00] P:1616.05 E:0.057672 |  Remember, Didier Drogba got a yellow card for bringing down Ribery, and...
[7487.00 - 7489.00] P:1582.52 E:0.040192 |  Make a change, Bayern.
[7489.00 - 7492.00] P:1377.83 E:0.069748 |  Ribery's off, by the way. We almost have forgotten about Ribery.
[7492.00 - 7493.00] P:1777.70 E:0.048431 |  Olić is coming on, I think.
[7493.00 - 7497.00] P:1523.85 E:0.059028 |  Olić is coming on, the man, of course, who's done well in the past against England,
[7497.00 - 7499.00] P:1424.24 E:0.050078 |  playing for Croatia. I must bring Steve Bruce in.
[7499.00 - 7502.00] P:1450.14 E:0.057169 |  Sorry, Steve, we've... in all the drama. Tell us your latest.
[7502.00 - 7504.00] P:1703.95 E:0.053267 |  Wow, it's just incredible drama, isn't it?
[7504.00 - 7507.00] P:1702.62 E:0.060272 |  I mean, and I'm sitting next to Marquis, and he says I don't fancy him.
[7507.00 - 7511.00] P:1844.07 E:0.061646 |  Chelsea's name's on the cup, so what we've just witnessed, is it their night?
[7511.00 - 7513.00] P:1963.83 E:0.048517 |  I mean, they were just...
[7513.00 - 7516.00] P:1880.34 E:0.065271 |  For the first time in the whole night there, just leading to the penalty,
[7516.00 - 7519.00] P:1609.00 E:0.062465 |  they were a little bit in control, that good possession.
[7519.00 - 7523.00] P:1830.48 E:0.060921 |  And, you know, is it written in the sky that it's Chelsea's night?
[7523.00 - 7527.00] P:1834.92 E:0.054455 |  It's a free kick to Bayern Munich, and they just tapped it back to Krus.
[7527.00 - 7531.00] P:1568.57 E:0.054449 |  So just to confirm that Olić is going to play on the left-hand side in place of Ribery,
[7531.00 - 7534.00] P:1440.03 E:0.063504 |  Robin is desperate now to redeem himself.
[7534.00 - 7537.00] P:1479.57 E:0.059162 |  The ball is with his captain, Laam, over on the right-hand side.
[7537.00 - 7539.00] P:1379.27 E:0.071315 |  Van Boijten's gone into the penalty area. He can be dangerous,
[7539.00 - 7541.00] P:1265.24 E:0.069218 |  and Van Boijten was there, it was a great block from Luis.
[7541.00 - 7543.00] P:1345.38 E:0.070656 |  Still dangerous, Lampard.
[7543.00 - 7545.00] P:1581.78 E:0.062597 |  That's the ball out for a corner kick.
[7545.00 - 7548.00] P:1551.57 E:0.060112 |  Yeah, well done, David, Luis.
[7548.00 - 7550.00] P:1648.00 E:0.068047 |  Bayern have been... Stunned his ground.
[7550.00 - 7552.00] P:1443.88 E:0.068316 |  Bayern have been stung, though, by that penalty miss.
[7552.00 - 7554.00] P:1466.28 E:0.058445 |  It seems to be driving them on a bit here.
[7554.00 - 7556.00] P:1598.19 E:0.043973 |  1-1.
[7556.00 - 7558.00] P:1558.90 E:0.068374 |  So here's a corner for Bayern.
[7558.00 - 7560.00] P:1574.24 E:0.054915 |  Van Boijten, who's come on, can be dangerous,
[7560.00 - 7562.00] P:1530.04 E:0.063742 |  but it's headed away at the near post by Frank Lampard.
[7562.00 - 7566.00] P:1262.23 E:0.066672 |  Laam will collect, and Laam this time ignores Robin,
[7566.00 - 7569.00] P:1435.57 E:0.058711 |  and floats the ball into the penalty area towards Gomez.
[7569.00 - 7571.00] P:1528.82 E:0.055446 |  It was a great clearance by Cahill.
[7571.00 - 7573.00] P:1605.19 E:0.061523 |  Torres tries to lift the ball over Timershoek,
[7573.00 - 7575.00] P:1359.98 E:0.047679 |  but then hits it straight to Boateng,
[7575.00 - 7577.00] P:1672.99 E:0.062839 |  and Bayern Munich getting back into the game again.
[7577.00 - 7581.00] P:1616.16 E:0.052951 |  Schweinsteiger and Timershoek together, and now Boateng.
[7581.00 - 7584.00] P:1659.97 E:0.060721 |  It's 1-1 here in this Champions League final, an extra time.
[7584.00 - 7587.00] P:1180.80 E:0.062404 |  Robin's missed a penalty, 5-5, BBC London, 94.9,
[7587.00 - 7590.00] P:1500.99 E:0.059577 |  and the World Service, and away goes Robin,
[7590.00 - 7593.00] P:1494.27 E:0.065916 |  again down that right-hand side up against Ashley Cole.
[7593.00 - 7595.00] P:1404.57 E:0.066792 |  Lampard finds Gomez, Miquel came in,
[7595.00 - 7597.00] P:1437.34 E:0.058996 |  and Czech will fall on the ball once more
[7597.00 - 7600.00] P:1604.66 E:0.055145 |  before Robin compounds, and Czech holds on once more.
[7600.00 - 7602.00] P:1643.72 E:0.059097 |  What's happened since Bertrand's gone off, Mike,
[7602.00 - 7606.00] P:1470.41 E:0.056838 |  is that Robin all of a sudden has got a little 10-yard-serun
[7606.00 - 7608.00] P:1582.37 E:0.062150 |  at Ashley Cole and caused one or two problems.
[7608.00 - 7611.00] P:1457.27 E:0.048025 |  Probably something Chelsea might have to do something about.
[7611.00 - 7613.00] P:1288.07 E:0.043420 |  Some movement down there on the bench, we think.
[7613.00 - 7616.00] P:1492.04 E:0.058587 |  Chelsea are going to make a change, and is it Palo Ferreira?
[7616.00 - 7618.00] P:1204.49 E:0.054613 |  I think the camera in the way down there.
[7618.00 - 7620.00] P:1258.36 E:0.058583 |  Ferreira is coming on.
[7620.00 - 7623.00] P:1153.61 E:0.059819 |  I rather thought that he might have a part to play here this evening.
[7623.00 - 7625.00] P:1256.39 E:0.058777 |  He's the only player in this Chelsea side
[7625.00 - 7629.00] P:1166.01 E:0.052325 |  who played in a winning Champions League side with Porto.
[7629.00 - 7631.00] P:1552.07 E:0.055579 |  Now it's Olic for the first time.
[7631.00 - 7634.00] P:1457.26 E:0.049792 |  Olic has come on for the injured rebrew,
[7634.00 - 7638.00] P:1452.38 E:0.055780 |  and now Van Boijten, and it's brighter now from Bayern Munich.
[7638.00 - 7642.00] P:1557.40 E:0.050355 |  But they've been pegged back here, and they've missed a chance to go in front.
[7642.00 - 7645.00] P:1378.51 E:0.052251 |  It's Timershoek once more in the centre-circle.
[7645.00 - 7647.00] P:1252.54 E:0.066356 |  Blazorball near side for Contento.
[7647.00 - 7650.00] P:1239.11 E:0.051652 |  Olic makes a run, Contento holds it.
[7650.00 - 7652.00] P:1204.47 E:0.053645 |  Chelsea players filter back once more.
[7652.00 - 7654.00] P:1359.72 E:0.061953 |  Basinger was there against Olic.
[7654.00 - 7656.00] P:1341.11 E:0.071424 |  We've got a little nudge as well, Basinger.
[7656.00 - 7660.00] P:1611.22 E:0.055485 |  And the referee, who's had a very good game, gives the free kick to Chelsea.
[7660.00 - 7664.00] P:1246.10 E:0.033663 |  Quite clever, actually, from...
[7664.00 - 7666.00] P:1280.84 E:0.048560 |  Here's a penalty again.
[7667.00 - 7669.00] P:1415.28 E:0.070944 |  It wasn't a particularly good penalty.
[7669.00 - 7672.00] P:1307.07 E:0.047648 |  Sometimes, I mean, there was a big delay,
[7672.00 - 7674.00] P:1202.20 E:0.065100 |  wasn't it, before Robin took the penalty?
[7674.00 - 7676.00] P:1241.14 E:0.057876 |  I mean, no, you don't think so.
[7676.00 - 7678.00] P:1736.22 E:0.061619 |  No, he under was, yeah, but Bayern...
[7678.00 - 7682.00] P:1565.19 E:0.047936 |  Players of this class should score penalties, end of.
[7682.00 - 7685.00] P:1286.13 E:0.066096 |  And he normally does. He's normally pretty reliable, Bayern.
[7685.00 - 7687.00] P:1461.13 E:0.057990 |  Now it's Olic, no, it's not Olic,
[7687.00 - 7689.00] P:1536.60 E:0.067332 |  because Basinger chose good control the right back,
[7689.00 - 7692.00] P:1264.43 E:0.058912 |  played the ball, referee does well there, opens his legs, Lampard has it.
[7692.00 - 7696.00] P:1279.58 E:0.056647 |  And now it's Florin Maluda of Chelsea, seeking out Drogba down the far side.
[7696.00 - 7699.00] P:1280.60 E:0.068260 |  I don't think he's going to get very far here against Van Boijten.
[7699.00 - 7702.00] P:1469.47 E:0.062837 |  Has to be careful, Drogba has to rein it in a little bit here,
[7702.00 - 7704.00] P:1478.38 E:0.069195 |  screaming at the referee, he's on a yellow card.
[7704.00 - 7706.00] P:1498.63 E:0.058232 |  Just keep it all together here for Chelsea.
[7706.00 - 7709.00] P:1451.10 E:0.052084 |  It could still be their night, very much so.
[7709.00 - 7712.00] P:1472.77 E:0.051109 |  Nine nearly ten minutes gone in the second half.
[7712.00 - 7714.00] P:1348.00 E:0.053082 |  Bayern Munich won Chelsea one.
[7714.00 - 7717.00] P:1106.80 E:0.058503 |  Barcelona were the better side in Barcelona,
[7717.00 - 7720.00] P:1202.31 E:0.055798 |  but it didn't matter, messy Mr. Penalty,
[7720.00 - 7722.00] P:1331.68 E:0.060388 |  Robin's Mr. Penalty here.
[7722.00 - 7725.00] P:1525.71 E:0.052672 |  The ball is with Neuer in Bayern's goal.
[7725.00 - 7728.00] P:1362.58 E:0.059778 |  Hits the ball down the centre, towards Gomez.
[7728.00 - 7731.00] P:1519.05 E:0.053923 |  Luis against Gomez, and Luis was clever there.
[7731.00 - 7735.00] P:1560.77 E:0.054226 |  Just made sure that he was physically there,
[7735.00 - 7738.00] P:1254.57 E:0.056652 |  and made sure Gomez couldn't get the better of him,
[7738.00 - 7740.00] P:1142.65 E:0.048558 |  and Chelsea bring the ball out.
[7740.00 - 7745.00] P:1350.93 E:0.056103 |  Miquel, who's really patrolled that midfield area well tonight for Chelsea.
[7745.00 - 7747.00] P:1226.50 E:0.064682 |  Chelsea still have to be very, very careful.
[7747.00 - 7751.00] P:1367.26 E:0.053181 |  Miquel, at the moment in the centre half position, finds Lampard.
[7751.00 - 7755.00] P:1083.91 E:0.070275 |  Chelsea fans making a noise once more.
[7755.00 - 7758.00] P:1342.58 E:0.054893 |  Delirious as Czech fell on that penalty from Robin.
[7758.00 - 7763.00] P:1228.90 E:0.070917 |  And Czech finds Ashley Cole, who looked very tired at the end of the 90 minutes.
[7763.00 - 7765.00] P:993.13 E:0.044522 |  Cole into Lampard.
[7765.00 - 7767.00] P:1121.97 E:0.073894 |  Can Chelsea respond again?
[7767.00 - 7769.00] P:1019.21 E:0.058779 |  Lampard into Gary Cahill.
[7769.00 - 7772.00] P:1380.03 E:0.065908 |  We had a headed goal from Muller for Bayern, 83 minutes.
[7772.00 - 7775.00] P:1176.31 E:0.061762 |  Five minutes later, Drogba with a header from a corner.
[7775.00 - 7778.00] P:1394.87 E:0.049182 |  Chelsea's first corner of the game, one-one.
[7778.00 - 7780.00] P:1134.15 E:0.055527 |  And since then a Robin missed penalty.
[7780.00 - 7784.00] P:1469.17 E:0.059690 |  Chelsea just keeping the ball, and then Luis gives it away.
[7784.00 - 7787.00] P:1324.48 E:0.055301 |  Oh, he hit that straight into the Bayern Munich defence.
[7787.00 - 7789.00] P:1260.10 E:0.049886 |  And here comes Timershoek now,
[7789.00 - 7791.00] P:1332.73 E:0.070996 |  but Walsz scrambled away by Lampard.
[7791.00 - 7793.00] P:1241.97 E:0.049793 |  Matta, he's got Torres ahead of him.
[7793.00 - 7796.00] P:1242.76 E:0.055086 |  Matta plays it down the right-hand side.
[7796.00 - 7798.00] P:1316.12 E:0.068959 |  He was fouled off the ball afterwards by Timershoek.
[7798.00 - 7800.00] P:1469.69 E:0.063509 |  The referee's played advantage.
[7800.00 - 7802.00] P:1608.36 E:0.057830 |  Torres going forward, and still Torres going forward,
[7802.00 - 7804.00] P:1414.31 E:0.071855 |  and still Torres, oh, in the end.
[7804.00 - 7807.00] P:1396.38 E:0.063082 |  He just hit it ahead of himself, and too wide.
[7807.00 - 7811.00] P:1600.00 E:0.055076 |  I think Drogba sort of ran in his path a little bit.
[7811.00 - 7814.00] P:1442.07 E:0.065921 |  He thought for a moment he was going to be in the way,
[7814.00 - 7816.00] P:1326.13 E:0.068585 |  and he just had a heavy touch at the end
[7816.00 - 7819.00] P:1103.37 E:0.066523 |  when he sort of wriggled through, hadn't he?
[7819.00 - 7821.00] P:1364.02 E:0.066274 |  Three and a half minutes left of added time
[7821.00 - 7824.00] P:1355.75 E:0.038204 |  in this first period of added time.
[7824.00 - 7829.00] P:1386.63 E:0.049932 |  Getting ever, ever closer to a possible penalty shoot out here.
[7829.00 - 7831.00] P:1328.19 E:0.065913 |  Remember what happened to Chelsea four years ago
[7831.00 - 7834.00] P:1166.77 E:0.048890 |  in Bayern Munich, 100% record in penalties.
[7834.00 - 7836.00] P:1365.47 E:0.069019 |  Now, Robbins' header on, looking for Olic.
[7836.00 - 7838.00] P:1674.92 E:0.056652 |  Olic back again towards Robin.
[7838.00 - 7840.00] P:1513.53 E:0.062343 |  Ashley Cole has to be careful on the edge of the area.
[7840.00 - 7842.00] P:1480.51 E:0.056094 |  Good quick feet there from the fallback.
[7842.00 - 7844.00] P:1541.77 E:0.061027 |  And Chelsea looking to clear,
[7844.00 - 7846.00] P:1399.90 E:0.069155 |  but the singles pass towards Torres.
[7846.00 - 7848.00] P:1379.14 E:0.057793 |  He made a run, and it's gone behind him.
[7848.00 - 7851.00] P:1497.47 E:0.054109 |  And Contento now finds Khrus for Bayern Munich.
[7851.00 - 7853.00] P:1530.61 E:0.058844 |  Khrus looking for Olic, cleared by Besingwer.
[7853.00 - 7856.00] P:1381.74 E:0.054683 |  It's a bit loose, and it's a bit scrappy at the moment.
[7856.00 - 7858.00] P:1279.36 E:0.056363 |  Torres now, if the ball will come down for him.
[7858.00 - 7861.00] P:1360.23 E:0.062495 |  Botenk's leaping all over him, and then he fouls him.
[7861.00 - 7863.00] P:1520.26 E:0.064730 |  And Torres wins the free kick,
[7863.00 - 7866.00] P:1416.96 E:0.056861 |  and needs to just take it, he's taken it quickly.
[7866.00 - 7868.00] P:1442.36 E:0.065386 |  Finds Lampard, Lampard going around Schweinsteiger.
[7868.00 - 7870.00] P:1313.48 E:0.059545 |  Matto trying to control this.
[7870.00 - 7872.00] P:1260.83 E:0.074009 |  Handball on the ground there by Robin,
[7872.00 - 7874.00] P:1302.42 E:0.066392 |  clearly as Matto tries to threaten.
[7874.00 - 7877.00] P:1276.53 E:0.052224 |  Mat should be a yellow card for him.
[7877.00 - 7879.00] P:1494.30 E:0.051474 |  It should be, but look, it is.
[7881.00 - 7883.00] P:1169.75 E:0.061716 |  Well, he hasn't produced it yet,
[7883.00 - 7885.00] P:1011.52 E:0.054078 |  but where's the consistency?
[7885.00 - 7888.00] P:1167.89 E:0.066777 |  Anyway, he hasn't shown him a yellow card.
[7888.00 - 7890.00] P:1347.30 E:0.070144 |  He showed Wontage-Schweinsteiger
[7890.00 - 7892.00] P:1181.53 E:0.053032 |  in the first two minutes of the game.
[7892.00 - 7896.00] P:1341.22 E:0.051026 |  Well, anyway, can Chelsea punish that handball now
[7896.00 - 7898.00] P:1434.13 E:0.058307 |  from Arjen Robin, just to round off his night?
[7898.00 - 7901.00] P:1162.99 E:0.050153 |  Nearly 13 minutes gone in the second half.
[7901.00 - 7904.00] P:1144.22 E:0.057341 |  And we've got Matto and Lampard together.
[7904.00 - 7906.00] P:1222.38 E:0.045974 |  Mikkel backs away.
[7906.00 - 7908.00] P:1313.56 E:0.062895 |  Torres is on the right edge of the area.
[7908.00 - 7910.00] P:1327.66 E:0.052960 |  Dragbos down the centre.
[7910.00 - 7912.00] P:1303.72 E:0.046261 |  Gary Cahill has gone forward.
[7912.00 - 7914.00] P:1221.81 E:0.049295 |  Scored some important goals over the years.
[7914.00 - 7916.00] P:1629.89 E:0.061008 |  Matto now plants the ball towards Torres.
[7916.00 - 7919.00] P:1373.59 E:0.052044 |  Torres brings it down on the edge of the penalty area.
[7919.00 - 7922.00] P:1386.53 E:0.065846 |  Still possibilities here on nice play from Torres.
[7922.00 - 7924.00] P:1121.81 E:0.070513 |  Torres ball in towards Dragbos,
[7924.00 - 7926.00] P:1498.66 E:0.060679 |  and he's been played by Lampard to the far side.
[7926.00 - 7929.00] P:1749.16 E:0.064632 |  He looked as though he wasn't just quite going to get that touch on it, Lampard.
[7929.00 - 7931.00] P:1745.89 E:0.056612 |  He just streched a little bit.
[7931.00 - 7933.00] P:1338.85 E:0.068936 |  Lampard following the Chelsea throw,
[7933.00 - 7935.00] P:1576.04 E:0.059075 |  works the ball in towards Dragbos.
[7935.00 - 7938.00] P:1464.49 E:0.064850 |  Feinsteiger's there, and now it's a counterattack from Bayern Munich,
[7938.00 - 7940.00] P:1436.39 E:0.060216 |  but there are lots of blue shirts back already waiting.
[7940.00 - 7943.00] P:1359.99 E:0.053151 |  Kruist finding Lampard, the outstanding Lampard on the right back.
[7943.00 - 7945.00] P:1219.40 E:0.055526 |  On to Robin, on the halfway line.
[7945.00 - 7947.00] P:1316.94 E:0.043878 |  Robin gives it to Kruist.
[7947.00 - 7949.00] P:1393.66 E:0.068850 |  Gomez strolls towards the penalty area.
[7949.00 - 7951.00] P:1177.64 E:0.059941 |  Kruist played the ball in behind Arjen Robin,
[7951.00 - 7953.00] P:1273.58 E:0.065452 |  and Chelsea will tidy up once more.
[7953.00 - 7955.00] P:1451.97 E:0.059835 |  Look a bit like him, mate.
[7955.00 - 7957.00] P:1369.80 E:0.072892 |  Long ball down, fear looking for Dragbos,
[7957.00 - 7959.00] P:1624.59 E:0.043628 |  he'll try and go in between the two centre-backs.
[7959.00 - 7962.00] P:1437.32 E:0.067402 |  We are now van Boijten and Boeteng, but Boeteng was quick and alive.
[7962.00 - 7966.00] P:1553.49 E:0.056470 |  The destructive players, the ones who can take people on for Bayern Munich,
[7966.00 - 7969.00] P:1611.80 E:0.056953 |  just look a little bit like him at the moment.
[7969.00 - 7972.00] P:1545.02 E:0.076393 |  14 minutes gone in this, and they give the ball away,
[7972.00 - 7975.00] P:1741.50 E:0.063172 |  and of course last week they had that sort of traumatic German cup final,
[7975.00 - 7978.00] P:1759.69 E:0.060096 |  losing 5-2 to Börsch Adortmann,
[7978.00 - 7980.00] P:1654.61 E:0.062965 |  who've eclipsed them all season domestically.
[7980.00 - 7983.00] P:1789.42 E:0.061625 |  This Champions League is still there for Chelsea,
[7983.00 - 7986.00] P:1608.08 E:0.063415 |  but they're running out of time at the end of the first period of extra time.
[7986.00 - 7989.00] P:1415.59 E:0.052901 |  It's Molluder now of Chelsea, hasn't had too many moments.
[7989.00 - 7992.00] P:1374.07 E:0.059858 |  Molluder to Cole, trying to return it to Molluder.
[7992.00 - 7995.00] P:1547.11 E:0.061912 |  Van Boijten, who's been out for a very long time with injury,
[7995.00 - 7997.00] P:1360.71 E:0.053905 |  gets the ball inside the penalty area,
[7997.00 - 8000.00] P:1229.40 E:0.058034 |  and Bayern Munich now play a good ball up to Kruist,
[8000.00 - 8002.00] P:1482.17 E:0.056329 |  but in comes a great challenge from Lampard.
[8002.00 - 8004.00] P:1569.96 E:0.060916 |  Fantastic work there from the Chelsea captain.
[8004.00 - 8005.00] P:1303.20 E:0.057748 |  Molluder now.
[8005.00 - 8007.00] P:1318.61 E:0.047952 |  Molluder gives the ball back to Luis,
[8007.00 - 8010.00] P:1446.59 E:0.062684 |  we've just seconds left at the end of this first period of extra time.
[8010.00 - 8013.00] P:1447.12 E:0.059860 |  The most dramatic moment when Robin missed a penalty.
[8013.00 - 8017.00] P:1397.76 E:0.060533 |  Miquel's long ball over the top, but Drogba's going to be flagged offside.
[8017.00 - 8019.00] P:1393.17 E:0.037602 |  And that's a free kick to Bayern Munich.
[8019.00 - 8022.00] P:1423.84 E:0.046508 |  Well, Börsch Adortmann's fortunate, because he wasn't quite sure.
[8022.00 - 8025.00] P:1576.32 E:0.054509 |  He was the last man, he was caught for a split second.
[8025.00 - 8030.00] P:1480.54 E:0.056940 |  One minute of added time at the end of this first 15 minutes of extra time.
[8030.00 - 8033.00] P:1704.42 E:0.052312 |  A chance maybe for Bayern, Olic, one of their substitutes.
[8033.00 - 8035.00] P:1700.77 E:0.055176 |  Olic going towards the dead ball line,
[8035.00 - 8038.00] P:1699.64 E:0.060926 |  then he just checks and still Olic.
[8038.00 - 8040.00] P:1711.21 E:0.052767 |  Chelsea try and get players back.
[8040.00 - 8043.00] P:1657.25 E:0.052231 |  Olic feeds the ball into midfield to Schweinsteiger.
[8043.00 - 8046.00] P:1533.70 E:0.054686 |  Olic again, nicely they'll turn on the ball.
[8046.00 - 8048.00] P:1413.20 E:0.062006 |  Back to Schweinsteiger.
[8048.00 - 8050.00] P:1553.07 E:0.055579 |  The ball is with Kruist.
[8050.00 - 8052.00] P:1679.40 E:0.062174 |  Kruist looking for a 1-2 with Gomez.
[8052.00 - 8054.00] P:1689.66 E:0.068540 |  Chelsea have it, maybe Chelsea will have a chance.
[8054.00 - 8056.00] P:1268.58 E:0.057492 |  Right at the end, Lampard's been crowded out,
[8056.00 - 8061.00] P:1488.81 E:0.054639 |  and he can't find Drogba, and Contento lifts the ball forward to Olic once more.
[8061.00 - 8065.00] P:1573.97 E:0.060291 |  We've got about 25 seconds of added time at the end of the first period of extra time.
[8065.00 - 8068.00] P:1506.64 E:0.044651 |  Contento wide on the left.
[8069.00 - 8073.00] P:1769.56 E:0.043899 |  Schimachuk is screaming for it.
[8073.00 - 8077.00] P:1733.82 E:0.056383 |  Still Bayern Munich trying to win a corner kick here.
[8077.00 - 8079.00] P:1401.33 E:0.060380 |  How on the referee's given?
[8079.00 - 8080.00] P:1396.41 E:0.065918 |  Foul by Lampard, I think.
[8080.00 - 8082.00] P:1366.56 E:0.050089 |  Foul, free kick right at the end of...
[8082.00 - 8086.00] P:1465.28 E:0.054278 |  This will be the last kick of the first period of extra time.
[8086.00 - 8090.00] P:1372.72 E:0.059934 |  And again, Van Boijten is potentially a danger man here for Chelsea.
[8090.00 - 8093.00] P:1556.39 E:0.061058 |  He scored many goals for his country and his clubs.
[8093.00 - 8096.00] P:1462.66 E:0.066549 |  So, Boijten and Van Boijten together.
[8096.00 - 8099.00] P:1642.71 E:0.066126 |  This free kick will be taken by Kruist.
[8099.00 - 8103.00] P:1708.43 E:0.068292 |  So it's Chelsea's turn now just to hang on at the end of this first period.
[8103.00 - 8106.00] P:1823.66 E:0.051293 |  Kruist with a free kick for Bayern Munich.
[8106.00 - 8108.00] P:1681.50 E:0.069929 |  It's played very deep towards Robin,
[8108.00 - 8110.00] P:1457.67 E:0.070071 |  and Drogba cuts it out on the volley,
[8110.00 - 8114.00] P:1638.26 E:0.060129 |  and that'll be the end of the first period of extra time.
[8115.00 - 8118.00] P:1628.92 E:0.066306 |  So, 1-1 at the end of the 90 minutes.
[8118.00 - 8121.00] P:1705.17 E:0.054397 |  Two minutes from time, Drogba equalising.
[8121.00 - 8124.00] P:1613.36 E:0.049765 |  And then in this first period of extra time,
[8124.00 - 8126.00] P:1668.07 E:0.057638 |  just when Chelsea seemed to have the initiative,
[8126.00 - 8128.00] P:1390.35 E:0.051689 |  Robin's penalty, but it was missed.
[8128.00 - 8132.00] P:1348.76 E:0.039988 |  And now through to the end of extra time, Alan Green.
[8134.00 - 8137.00] P:1305.66 E:0.051955 |  I know how to be cooked with this.
[8137.00 - 8141.00] P:1379.63 E:0.055884 |  Michael, myself, have watched so many dramatic games this season.
[8141.00 - 8143.00] P:1703.09 E:0.062418 |  The referee's very anxious, of course, to get them there.
[8143.00 - 8145.00] P:1544.40 E:0.064875 |  Yeah, I know, everyone wants to take flu down.
[8145.00 - 8147.00] P:1459.10 E:0.053050 |  They want to have a break, they want to have a drink.
[8147.00 - 8149.00] P:1290.15 E:0.028688 |  But it's not going to be a good thing.
[8149.00 - 8152.00] P:1439.72 E:0.042826 |  I mean, are you on a time pressure referee?
[8152.00 - 8155.00] P:1318.76 E:0.053633 |  Well, I'm sure he is, to a degree.
[8155.00 - 8157.00] P:1323.46 E:0.066342 |  But the whole, not just the whole of Europe,
[8157.00 - 8159.00] P:1418.65 E:0.041493 |  the whole of the world will be captured
[8159.00 - 8164.00] P:1463.97 E:0.053772 |  by this dramatic conclusion to the 2012 Champions League final.
[8164.00 - 8168.00] P:1500.18 E:0.045772 |  By the way, there may be penalties, of course,
[8168.00 - 8172.00] P:1255.92 E:0.059315 |  but at the moment we're anticipating 606 to start at 10.30
[8172.00 - 8176.00] P:1546.45 E:0.055109 |  in a run for an hour. 0-500, 9-9, 6-9, 3.
[8176.00 - 8179.00] P:1263.27 E:0.056112 |  If you've got any voice left, that is.
[8179.00 - 8183.00] P:1605.42 E:0.046954 |  Well, who would blame the players for wanting to have some liquid?
[8185.00 - 8187.00] P:1430.54 E:0.060378 |  Pretty fancy.
[8187.00 - 8189.00] P:1672.38 E:0.057836 |  This is going to pend.
[8189.00 - 8191.00] P:1916.23 E:0.043508 |  Is it? Yeah.
[8191.00 - 8193.00] P:1757.83 E:0.069603 |  Yeah, I've got that feeling too.
[8193.00 - 8196.00] P:1807.69 E:0.063207 |  I said to you, I thought the keeper would serve it.
[8196.00 - 8199.00] P:1884.21 E:0.052242 |  Yeah, absolutely. You turned to me and you thought, save.
[8199.00 - 8202.00] P:1893.84 E:0.043738 |  You said save. Didn't fancy Robin at all.
[8202.00 - 8204.00] P:1695.85 E:0.054804 |  Well, Robin...
[8204.00 - 8207.00] P:1841.41 E:0.047919 |  I'd say we're jumping out the seat watching this when Robin missed.
[8207.00 - 8209.00] P:1817.05 E:0.045563 |  Jose Mourinho.
[8209.00 - 8212.00] P:1617.62 E:0.054194 |  He'd have been absolutely delighted, by the way.
[8214.00 - 8217.00] P:1739.19 E:0.057810 |  Right, finally, the players appear to be ready.
[8217.00 - 8221.00] P:1832.88 E:0.055506 |  It's nearly 11 o'clock in the evening here in Munich.
[8221.00 - 8225.00] P:1711.94 E:0.057432 |  10 o'clock for those listening at Five Live in BBC London.
[8225.00 - 8228.00] P:1630.34 E:0.060571 |  Heaven only knows what time it is if you're listening to the World Service.
[8228.00 - 8230.00] P:1752.89 E:0.062845 |  94.9 or 94.5?
[8230.00 - 8232.00] P:1795.91 E:0.047401 |  94.9. OK.
[8233.00 - 8237.00] P:1737.51 E:0.058502 |  Now, Chelsea are attacking the end behind which their fans are gathered.
[8237.00 - 8242.00] P:1567.87 E:0.052103 |  They are heavily outnumbered here in the Allianz Arena in Munich,
[8242.00 - 8244.00] P:1491.63 E:0.052351 |  but boy, did they celebrate.
[8244.00 - 8248.00] P:1363.35 E:0.049612 |  Drogba's headed equaliser close to the end of 90 minutes.
[8248.00 - 8254.00] P:1304.52 E:0.046611 |  Drogba and Torres, between them, two fantastic strikers.
[8254.00 - 8259.00] P:1268.56 E:0.052310 |  Can they prize a winner here on the home of Barne Munich?
[8260.00 - 8264.00] P:1344.79 E:0.051450 |  The final 15 minutes is underway, and Vsingua heads it up,
[8264.00 - 8266.00] P:1314.37 E:0.057655 |  feels towards Drogba.
[8266.00 - 8270.00] P:1314.11 E:0.050048 |  Drogba heads it on, van Boijken shaped as if he had hurt himself there.
[8270.00 - 8274.00] P:1332.38 E:0.050938 |  I think he's OK, and it's cleared by Lamm, the Munich captain,
[8274.00 - 8277.00] P:1353.58 E:0.057959 |  up towards the halfway line, but Gomez has hardly been in it, really,
[8277.00 - 8279.00] P:1332.70 E:0.049144 |  for the last half an hour.
[8279.00 - 8281.00] P:1206.36 E:0.045019 |  Hardly noticed him.
[8281.00 - 8283.00] P:1374.99 E:0.046635 |  Here's Miquel, he's been immense.
[8283.00 - 8285.00] P:1186.17 E:0.056552 |  Back to Cahill.
[8285.00 - 8288.00] P:1327.36 E:0.056861 |  Cahill to Torres, Vsingua on the far side of the field.
[8288.00 - 8291.00] P:1424.75 E:0.059784 |  Into Torres, Torres tackled though, loses the ball to Cruz.
[8291.00 - 8293.00] P:1405.66 E:0.045637 |  The challenge was by Schweinsteiger.
[8293.00 - 8297.00] P:1403.87 E:0.057118 |  Schweinsteiger takes it up, plays it to the left to Olig.
[8297.00 - 8300.00] P:1551.86 E:0.055725 |  Olig is fresh, of course, substitute for Barne Munich.
[8300.00 - 8302.00] P:1390.51 E:0.050771 |  Back to Schweinsteiger.
[8302.00 - 8304.00] P:1340.95 E:0.046996 |  They look tired, don't they?
[8304.00 - 8306.00] P:1526.48 E:0.061630 |  They look like he said to Mike,
[8306.00 - 8309.00] P:1622.95 E:0.052947 |  that it's sort of end of the first extra-time period.
[8309.00 - 8313.00] P:1333.40 E:0.055129 |  Timershoop to Robin, down the right side, back to Lamm,
[8313.00 - 8316.00] P:1243.45 E:0.045906 |  on to Robin again, declines to get the cross in early,
[8316.00 - 8319.00] P:1185.33 E:0.056237 |  Mike played in early now, he doesn't.
[8319.00 - 8322.00] P:1267.07 E:0.061714 |  Delayed, delayed, delayed, and finally when he flipped it
[8322.00 - 8324.00] P:1227.62 E:0.050771 |  towards the penalty area, took an inflection,
[8324.00 - 8326.00] P:1473.88 E:0.049058 |  and Chelsea clear it up field.
[8326.00 - 8330.00] P:1155.44 E:0.044138 |  Van Boijten and Boateng almost confuse each other,
[8330.00 - 8333.00] P:1318.50 E:0.058693 |  but Van Boijten has the ball.
[8333.00 - 8336.00] P:1495.88 E:0.060464 |  And onto the far side, and Contento.
[8336.00 - 8339.00] P:1594.81 E:0.060740 |  Contento leaving it to Schweinsteiger.
[8339.00 - 8342.00] P:1529.64 E:0.056347 |  The Bayern fans have found their voices again.
[8342.00 - 8344.00] P:1611.68 E:0.053574 |  It's to Olig.
[8344.00 - 8346.00] P:1690.79 E:0.044869 |  Olig looks quick.
[8346.00 - 8349.00] P:1409.88 E:0.057545 |  Bersingu is across there, trying to impede his progress.
[8349.00 - 8352.00] P:1477.88 E:0.057475 |  Olig has made progress, 30 yards towards the goal line,
[8352.00 - 8354.00] P:1692.77 E:0.064222 |  and he crosses it, hits Bersingua,
[8354.00 - 8357.00] P:1700.76 E:0.057844 |  and is behind for a corner, though Bersingua protests.
[8357.00 - 8359.00] P:1612.30 E:0.057580 |  And they're all up, Alan. The big guns are up.
[8359.00 - 8361.00] P:1509.84 E:0.046421 |  Boateng's up, Van Biten's up.
[8363.00 - 8367.00] P:1465.97 E:0.046975 |  13 minutes of extra-time remaining.
[8367.00 - 8370.00] P:1593.49 E:0.044135 |  Corner to Bayern Munich.
[8370.00 - 8372.00] P:1724.65 E:0.052759 |  Cross to take it.
[8372.00 - 8374.00] P:1619.65 E:0.054966 |  And it's out of the penalty area.
[8374.00 - 8376.00] P:1482.85 E:0.051719 |  At least temporarily.
[8376.00 - 8378.00] P:1342.58 E:0.052417 |  Cross back to Robin.
[8378.00 - 8380.00] P:1527.47 E:0.051570 |  Robin now to Boateng.
[8380.00 - 8382.00] P:1395.99 E:0.038785 |  Boateng on his right foot, shoots,
[8382.00 - 8385.00] P:1371.84 E:0.049783 |  and it's blocked by the right foot of Bersingua.
[8385.00 - 8388.00] P:1578.63 E:0.050847 |  And here it is again, with Bayern Munich.
[8388.00 - 8390.00] P:1368.95 E:0.035585 |  The cross into the penalty area.
[8390.00 - 8391.00] P:1620.54 E:0.062447 |  Good header away by Luis.
[8391.00 - 8393.00] P:1574.44 E:0.046803 |  Falls to Robin.
[8393.00 - 8395.00] P:1699.15 E:0.062173 |  Robin places it back to the captain.
[8395.00 - 8396.00] P:1591.39 E:0.047862 |  Lam scurries forward.
[8396.00 - 8398.00] P:1314.11 E:0.046118 |  There's a Chelsea fly-down injured.
[8398.00 - 8400.00] P:1582.91 E:0.066979 |  The cross into the penalty area.
[8400.00 - 8402.00] P:1590.91 E:0.068437 |  Here's a chance. Oh, it's hit play.
[8402.00 - 8405.00] P:1492.71 E:0.072348 |  By always. I think he was trying to set up Gomez.
[8405.00 - 8407.00] P:1473.59 E:0.071178 |  He was trying to set up Gomez,
[8407.00 - 8410.00] P:1500.71 E:0.059265 |  because just by his gesticulation, he's trying to say,
[8410.00 - 8412.00] P:1663.94 E:0.054641 |  I was knocking that back for you to Gomez,
[8412.00 - 8413.00] P:1695.79 E:0.055501 |  his run away now.
[8413.00 - 8415.00] P:1526.03 E:0.064573 |  Great ball from Lam.
[8415.00 - 8417.00] P:1564.43 E:0.049477 |  Absolutely brilliant ball, far post.
[8417.00 - 8419.00] P:1680.94 E:0.055738 |  What a chance that is.
[8419.00 - 8421.00] P:1756.89 E:0.045121 |  Why didn't he just shoot at Gomez?
[8421.00 - 8423.00] P:1751.64 E:0.057254 |  Well, in all honesty, he gets the pass, right, Alan?
[8423.00 - 8425.00] P:1713.86 E:0.046481 |  I think it's a tap-in for Gomez.
[8425.00 - 8428.00] P:1507.77 E:0.047567 |  If you look at the angle, it was probably a bit tight for him.
[8428.00 - 8430.00] P:1639.48 E:0.049709 |  Which is why he made this decision.
[8430.00 - 8433.00] P:1350.86 E:0.061327 |  It was a glorious cross from Phillip Lam.
[8433.00 - 8435.00] P:1707.06 E:0.048415 |  That's just a nice layoff for Gomez.
[8435.00 - 8438.00] P:1605.02 E:0.057148 |  Gomez almost tripped over his own feet.
[8438.00 - 8440.00] P:1586.19 E:0.063756 |  Droga had gone to an injury,
[8440.00 - 8443.00] P:1605.66 E:0.049279 |  and may need further treatment on the far side of the field.
[8443.00 - 8444.00] P:1467.55 E:0.056923 |  We'll see.
[8444.00 - 8446.00] P:1699.51 E:0.045116 |  Droga was going to the far touch line.
[8446.00 - 8448.00] P:1602.29 E:0.048702 |  They need him on the pitch.
[8448.00 - 8449.00] P:1841.54 E:0.071398 |  How many minutes to go?
[8449.00 - 8451.00] P:1528.59 E:0.039085 |  12 minutes to go here in five-live,
[8451.00 - 8454.00] P:1371.70 E:0.056596 |  BBC London and the World Service on the BBC.
[8454.00 - 8456.00] P:1409.50 E:0.052505 |  Here's Bersingar.
[8457.00 - 8459.00] P:1312.15 E:0.051983 |  Here's Bersingar.
[8459.00 - 8461.00] P:1590.61 E:0.050737 |  Droga was fit again.
[8461.00 - 8463.00] P:1398.68 E:0.064681 |  Bersingar, running back towards his own penalty area.
[8463.00 - 8466.00] P:1523.64 E:0.058238 |  Slides it back to Czech, who saved Robin's penalty.
[8466.00 - 8468.00] P:1573.05 E:0.064955 |  And Czech's clearance goes straight out of play
[8468.00 - 8470.00] P:1436.91 E:0.047035 |  on the far side of the field.
[8470.00 - 8473.00] P:1565.33 E:0.052525 |  Olich with the throw in to Schweinsteiger.
[8473.00 - 8476.00] P:1528.32 E:0.064568 |  Back to Olich, and Olich runs away far too easily from Torres.
[8476.00 - 8479.00] P:1538.37 E:0.066875 |  Takes on Bersingar, gets past him, and a cross came Kale.
[8479.00 - 8481.00] P:1552.03 E:0.063927 |  He's fouled by Olich.
[8481.00 - 8484.00] P:1637.86 E:0.070504 |  And the referee's given a throw, and I think that's a bit of a feeling.
[8484.00 - 8486.00] P:1680.42 E:0.051901 |  He just took him out.
[8486.00 - 8488.00] P:1699.84 E:0.059949 |  Throw in is only taken to Olich,
[8488.00 - 8491.00] P:1395.71 E:0.049039 |  who's contributed an awful lot more than the referee did.
[8491.00 - 8493.00] P:1712.82 E:0.046732 |  And he's a few minutes on the pitch.
[8493.00 - 8495.00] P:1614.01 E:0.044166 |  Well, he's just been very direct, hasn't he?
[8496.00 - 8498.00] P:1472.20 E:0.071086 |  Throw in wants more to Feinjordek.
[8498.00 - 8500.00] P:1193.24 E:0.059693 |  Ten yards from the corner flag on the far side.
[8500.00 - 8503.00] P:1397.40 E:0.062842 |  Throw him back to Krosz, hits it crossfield.
[8503.00 - 8505.00] P:1266.99 E:0.060702 |  Robin controls it on his left foot.
[8505.00 - 8507.00] P:1436.02 E:0.052945 |  He's about 30 yards from goal.
[8507.00 - 8508.00] P:1615.72 E:0.064687 |  Timur Shuk's available.
[8508.00 - 8510.00] P:1394.81 E:0.046391 |  It goes to the Ukrainian.
[8510.00 - 8512.00] P:1249.85 E:0.057089 |  And now, wide right again.
[8512.00 - 8514.00] P:1232.04 E:0.052728 |  To Llam, 11 minutes to go.
[8514.00 - 8517.00] P:1269.07 E:0.054955 |  And if there's no other goal, we're going to have penalties.
[8517.00 - 8520.00] P:1383.16 E:0.043330 |  Robin, who missed his penalty,
[8520.00 - 8523.00] P:1363.12 E:0.066937 |  a rather it was saved, but it was a wretched strike from Arjen Robin.
[8523.00 - 8525.00] P:1099.85 E:0.050457 |  Robin again.
[8525.00 - 8529.00] P:1181.12 E:0.068017 |  To Llam, and back it goes to Van Boijten inside the Munich half.
[8531.00 - 8533.00] P:1303.81 E:0.065900 |  Chelsea supporters are noisy.
[8533.00 - 8536.00] P:1283.33 E:0.072554 |  I think they need to be noisy to help carry their side through
[8536.00 - 8538.00] P:1247.17 E:0.053834 |  these 11 remaining minutes.
[8538.00 - 8541.00] P:1358.47 E:0.061619 |  For the most part, Chelsea have been on the back foot in the game.
[8541.00 - 8544.00] P:1351.82 E:0.058125 |  They should be more weary than Van Munich.
[8544.00 - 8548.00] P:1476.66 E:0.054153 |  Here's Robin, faced by two defenders, Maluda and Cole.
[8548.00 - 8550.00] P:1408.09 E:0.052600 |  Robin beats Cole, slides it back.
[8550.00 - 8552.00] P:1562.31 E:0.050984 |  Llam, edge of the penalty, crosses in low.
[8552.00 - 8554.00] P:1472.40 E:0.060348 |  Gomez can't control it, thankfully.
[8554.00 - 8556.00] P:1395.65 E:0.054475 |  And Miquel hits it away to Matta.
[8556.00 - 8558.00] P:1472.13 E:0.059136 |  Matta's layoff to Torres.
[8558.00 - 8560.00] P:1417.73 E:0.073049 |  Torres should have got there, didn't get there.
[8560.00 - 8562.00] P:1642.37 E:0.060765 |  Ball breaks to Olic.
[8562.00 - 8564.00] P:1512.97 E:0.061578 |  Olic, left edge of the penalty area, crosses into the box.
[8564.00 - 8566.00] P:1576.74 E:0.053028 |  It took an afflection, I think, over Chelsea's plan.
[8566.00 - 8568.00] P:1696.57 E:0.064971 |  It was Torres, Allen.
[8568.00 - 8570.00] P:1580.56 E:0.060645 |  Torres after making the mistake,
[8570.00 - 8573.00] P:1554.80 E:0.060062 |  actually got something on it by running back and making amends.
[8573.00 - 8575.00] P:1435.47 E:0.058550 |  Far too casual.
[8575.00 - 8577.00] P:1423.24 E:0.056431 |  10 minutes left for play.
[8577.00 - 8580.00] P:1433.44 E:0.053958 |  The ball is with Peter Cech.
[8580.00 - 8582.00] P:1287.08 E:0.059428 |  Bayern's last triumph.
[8582.00 - 8586.00] P:1302.44 E:0.055545 |  I saw when they beat Valencia, that was on penalties in 2001.
[8588.00 - 8591.00] P:1503.90 E:0.062031 |  Of course, since then, they've lost it into Milan in regular time.
[8591.00 - 8593.00] P:1417.69 E:0.044776 |  Two years ago, it's head-out field.
[8593.00 - 8596.00] P:1343.27 E:0.063175 |  Great control by Drogba into the penalty area,
[8596.00 - 8598.00] P:1520.21 E:0.059588 |  surrounded by Red Shirts.
[8598.00 - 8601.00] P:1572.66 E:0.060320 |  Ball breaks back to Torres. Torres can't get past.
[8601.00 - 8603.00] P:1543.93 E:0.065446 |  That was Schweinsteiger.
[8603.00 - 8605.00] P:1449.06 E:0.073093 |  Schweinsteiger keeps it in play. That was well done.
[8605.00 - 8608.00] P:1610.24 E:0.068714 |  Schweinsteiger, finding Cross, close over the halfway line.
[8608.00 - 8610.00] P:1570.55 E:0.062900 |  Bersingua looks very heavy-legged on the far side.
[8610.00 - 8612.00] P:1757.49 E:0.056456 |  On it goes to Olic.
[8612.00 - 8614.00] P:1537.93 E:0.055587 |  Olic should have crossed first time, didn't cross first time.
[8614.00 - 8616.00] P:1516.36 E:0.060573 |  Only Gomez was inside the Chelsea penalty area.
[8616.00 - 8618.00] P:1437.54 E:0.044443 |  Perhaps that's why he didn't.
[8618.00 - 8620.00] P:1579.42 E:0.055679 |  It's back to Cross.
[8620.00 - 8622.00] P:1429.18 E:0.054668 |  And now Schweinsteiger, 30 yards from goal.
[8622.00 - 8624.00] P:1413.31 E:0.044903 |  On to La.
[8624.00 - 8626.00] P:1516.38 E:0.043723 |  Bayern Munich continue to press.
[8626.00 - 8628.00] P:1172.61 E:0.053090 |  No, Robin wants more.
[8628.00 - 8630.00] P:1341.95 E:0.074832 |  Robin, couple of yards to the penalty area.
[8630.00 - 8632.00] P:1369.05 E:0.070612 |  Now pulls it back.
[8632.00 - 8634.00] P:1372.16 E:0.070118 |  Gomez should have turned it in.
[8634.00 - 8636.00] P:1566.93 E:0.062555 |  And Luis, he's behind to the corner.
[8636.00 - 8638.00] P:1495.49 E:0.061022 |  Gary Cahill, Alan, who's probably got cramp, I would suggest.
[8638.00 - 8642.00] P:1395.17 E:0.060567 |  He did brilliantly because he put Gomez under immense pressure.
[8642.00 - 8645.00] P:1547.81 E:0.059847 |  And then the ball came across, and Luis dealt with it.
[8645.00 - 8647.00] P:1544.63 E:0.057340 |  I thought it was split second, it might have hit him on the arm.
[8647.00 - 8650.00] P:1445.55 E:0.055814 |  He obviously didn't. But Gary Cahill did fantastically.
[8650.00 - 8652.00] P:1432.53 E:0.058327 |  And so, too, did Luis.
[8652.00 - 8654.00] P:1385.96 E:0.041538 |  Yeah.
[8654.00 - 8656.00] P:1417.30 E:0.071443 |  And he was climbing in the front.
[8656.00 - 8658.00] P:1787.50 E:0.072505 |  Couple of yards in front. He's standing up and looking at our monitor.
[8658.00 - 8660.00] P:1604.22 E:0.062419 |  Switch it off.
[8660.00 - 8662.00] P:1614.50 E:0.054432 |  And then he won't be able to save.
[8662.00 - 8664.00] P:1715.08 E:0.044554 |  OK, Dad.
[8665.00 - 8667.00] P:1712.90 E:0.058669 |  Cahill's OK.
[8667.00 - 8669.00] P:1757.75 E:0.062015 |  Cramp.
[8669.00 - 8671.00] P:1886.22 E:0.065853 |  It's definitely cramp.
[8671.00 - 8673.00] P:1900.04 E:0.060936 |  He's not giving up. No, should he?
[8673.00 - 8675.00] P:1906.35 E:0.056733 |  Chelsea...
[8675.00 - 8677.00] P:1950.29 E:0.063564 |  Is he having to go off? He's trying to make him go off.
[8677.00 - 8679.00] P:1841.32 E:0.055172 |  Oh, should he not?
[8679.00 - 8681.00] P:1718.40 E:0.064479 |  He is.
[8681.00 - 8683.00] P:1690.67 E:0.073012 |  Eight minutes to go. Chelsea facing a fine corner.
[8683.00 - 8686.00] P:1845.32 E:0.054964 |  And Cahill forced to go off the pitch.
[8686.00 - 8688.00] P:1829.54 E:0.048735 |  Hope that's not costly.
[8688.00 - 8692.00] P:1610.29 E:0.049223 |  Robin's going to take the corner from the right side.
[8692.00 - 8694.00] P:1356.33 E:0.040481 |  Playing it in, left-footed.
[8694.00 - 8696.00] P:1471.97 E:0.052034 |  Watch out for Van Boyden.
[8696.00 - 8698.00] P:1463.12 E:0.049865 |  Here comes Robin. Playing it in.
[8698.00 - 8701.00] P:1701.63 E:0.063065 |  Deliberately deep. Torres rushes towards the edge of the penalty.
[8701.00 - 8703.00] P:1723.28 E:0.062396 |  And heads it out of play.
[8703.00 - 8705.00] P:1641.77 E:0.050989 |  And Cahill, surely, must be allowed back on.
[8705.00 - 8707.00] P:1471.62 E:0.063336 |  Yeah, he's out.
[8707.00 - 8709.00] P:1588.15 E:0.053911 |  Finally, back on. Throw in to Barn Munich on the far side of the field.
[8709.00 - 8711.00] P:1606.88 E:0.056965 |  Seven and a half minutes to go.
[8711.00 - 8713.00] P:1570.05 E:0.047675 |  Second period of extra tie.
[8713.00 - 8715.00] P:1334.97 E:0.045507 |  Barn Munich won. Chelsea won.
[8715.00 - 8717.00] P:1203.38 E:0.035446 |  Laugh for Barn Munich.
[8717.00 - 8719.00] P:1268.88 E:0.056983 |  Onto Robin.
[8719.00 - 8721.00] P:1373.06 E:0.056346 |  Robin again. Moves in towards the edge of the penalty.
[8721.00 - 8723.00] P:1442.42 E:0.063326 |  Still going.
[8723.00 - 8725.00] P:1358.98 E:0.067938 |  Robin shoots wildly wide.
[8725.00 - 8727.00] P:1689.40 E:0.060474 |  High often, has he done that tonight?
[8727.00 - 8729.00] P:1769.41 E:0.063535 |  Quite a few times, but you can see it's a desperation attempt
[8729.00 - 8731.00] P:1630.98 E:0.057216 |  in Sofar as to make up for the missed penalty.
[8731.00 - 8733.00] P:1603.64 E:0.064622 |  Well, try crossing the ball in towards the whist.
[8733.00 - 8735.00] P:1688.34 E:0.060617 |  But on every single occasion,
[8735.00 - 8738.00] P:1672.42 E:0.052094 |  when he's cut inside, he's miscued every single shot.
[8738.00 - 8740.00] P:1135.75 E:0.042433 |  Part from...
[8740.00 - 8742.00] P:1270.38 E:0.053169 |  Part from one problem in the whole game.
[8742.00 - 8744.00] P:1594.69 E:0.053087 |  Seven minutes.
[8744.00 - 8746.00] P:1551.23 E:0.064612 |  Cahill's moving, OK.
[8746.00 - 8748.00] P:1527.48 E:0.057676 |  A bit gingerly, but... Thankfully.
[8748.00 - 8750.00] P:1562.68 E:0.069553 |  I mean, it's remarkable that Luis and Cahill
[8750.00 - 8752.00] P:1470.02 E:0.055021 |  are going to make it through 120 minutes.
[8752.00 - 8754.00] P:1488.88 E:0.035660 |  Here's Matta.
[8754.00 - 8756.00] P:1648.41 E:0.056857 |  Matta caught in possession.
[8756.00 - 8758.00] P:1630.20 E:0.059775 |  And it's taken up by Schweinsteiger.
[8758.00 - 8760.00] P:1519.19 E:0.053465 |  Schweinsteiger with Olicz rushing down the left side.
[8760.00 - 8762.00] P:1575.76 E:0.065645 |  The pass was poor.
[8762.00 - 8764.00] P:1565.36 E:0.061732 |  Bersingwer intercepted. Bersingwer does well.
[8764.00 - 8766.00] P:1621.78 E:0.049224 |  Fingert Miquel. Miquel back to Cahill.
[8766.00 - 8768.00] P:1558.87 E:0.061827 |  Cahill probably didn't welcome that pass.
[8768.00 - 8770.00] P:1684.59 E:0.053630 |  But all to Luis.
[8770.00 - 8772.00] P:1650.97 E:0.056664 |  Don't give me the ball. I cramped for goodness' sake.
[8772.00 - 8774.00] P:1768.09 E:0.057143 |  You always get it. It's like a cookie-two drops a catch.
[8774.00 - 8776.00] P:1617.41 E:0.044703 |  The next one comes to him, innit?
[8776.00 - 8778.00] P:1311.02 E:0.059308 |  Here's Cole. Up to the halfway line.
[8778.00 - 8780.00] P:1505.65 E:0.061383 |  And crossing into Munich territory.
[8780.00 - 8782.00] P:1496.16 E:0.058497 |  Fáil tackled.
[8782.00 - 8784.00] P:1654.17 E:0.050283 |  Vycroce free-kick to Chelsea.
[8784.00 - 8786.00] P:1659.25 E:0.044592 |  Maluda plays it back to Luis.
[8786.00 - 8788.00] P:1356.67 E:0.041328 |  Don't give it to Cahill.
[8788.00 - 8790.00] P:1377.34 E:0.059750 |  Larch with Miquel inside the centre circle.
[8790.00 - 8792.00] P:1169.33 E:0.037535 |  We're going to have another change.
[8792.00 - 8794.00] P:1773.09 E:0.065303 |  Shortly, it has to be a barn change,
[8794.00 - 8796.00] P:1415.06 E:0.037053 |  because Chelsea...
[8796.00 - 8798.00] P:1423.16 E:0.048718 |  Oh, sorry. Ferreira, I think, Al.
[8798.00 - 8800.00] P:1620.94 E:0.059012 |  Ferreira's coming on. Chelsea can make one
[8800.00 - 8802.00] P:1541.41 E:0.047788 |  further substitution.
[8802.00 - 8804.00] P:1557.17 E:0.054759 |  Maybe he's worried about Cahill.
[8804.00 - 8806.00] P:1391.71 E:0.028520 |  Drop Bersingwer in there.
[8806.00 - 8808.00] P:1377.93 E:0.052621 |  Drop Bersingwer in there.
[8808.00 - 8810.00] P:1273.64 E:0.043624 |  Anyway, we've got a free-kick to barn Munich.
[8810.00 - 8812.00] P:1643.24 E:0.050170 |  Six minutes to go.
[8812.00 - 8814.00] P:1435.37 E:0.044243 |  Roberto Di Matteo
[8814.00 - 8816.00] P:1633.67 E:0.050734 |  out in the technical area.
[8816.00 - 8818.00] P:1567.95 E:0.062009 |  Hauer Ronnick,
[8818.00 - 8820.00] P:1718.20 E:0.050726 |  the Kurtz-Tekker manager,
[8820.00 - 8822.00] P:1596.37 E:0.054609 |  might lead Chelsea to triumph
[8822.00 - 8824.00] P:1779.83 E:0.061701 |  in the Champions League final.
[8824.00 - 8826.00] P:1756.41 E:0.059179 |  And what might be his last game?
[8826.00 - 8828.00] P:1344.13 E:0.059064 |  Yeah.
[8828.00 - 8830.00] P:1348.98 E:0.067931 |  Balls in the halfway line.
[8830.00 - 8832.00] P:1688.68 E:0.047972 |  La.
[8832.00 - 8834.00] P:1633.00 E:0.066526 |  Back to Kroos.
[8834.00 - 8836.00] P:1266.69 E:0.064882 |  Onto La again.
[8836.00 - 8838.00] P:1302.64 E:0.052918 |  Into Robin. Robin.
[8838.00 - 8840.00] P:1377.77 E:0.043217 |  Midway inside the half.
[8840.00 - 8842.00] P:1670.99 E:0.054720 |  Finds on...
[8842.00 - 8844.00] P:1468.73 E:0.064373 |  Swainstegger.
[8844.00 - 8846.00] P:1578.65 E:0.060913 |  Swainstegger well tackled by Torres,
[8846.00 - 8848.00] P:1546.98 E:0.051596 |  but look how deep Torres is now.
[8848.00 - 8850.00] P:1599.87 E:0.048274 |  Only drug left upfield for Chelsea.
[8850.00 - 8852.00] P:1622.09 E:0.037896 |  Kroos to La.
[8852.00 - 8854.00] P:1460.10 E:0.040328 |  La into Robin now.
[8854.00 - 8856.00] P:1360.10 E:0.047926 |  Robin approaching the penalty area.
[8856.00 - 8858.00] P:1656.00 E:0.047417 |  To Schweinsteiger.
[8858.00 - 8860.00] P:1497.37 E:0.054597 |  Schweinsteiger well tackled.
[8860.00 - 8862.00] P:1401.24 E:0.060069 |  Lazy for Macau.
[8862.00 - 8864.00] P:1481.57 E:0.071422 |  Goodness. Don't give those away.
[8864.00 - 8866.00] P:1381.36 E:0.038027 |  Don't do it.
[8866.00 - 8868.00] P:1217.57 E:0.047145 |  Free-kick.
[8868.00 - 8870.00] P:1140.95 E:0.062984 |  Hopefully too far out
[8870.00 - 8872.00] P:1033.75 E:0.060058 |  for Robin to score from.
[8872.00 - 8874.00] P:1083.15 E:0.064473 |  But up from the back, Van Boijten
[8874.00 - 8876.00] P:1295.03 E:0.058942 |  and Boateng and Gomys.
[8876.00 - 8878.00] P:1531.35 E:0.062348 |  And Petty Cech saying he's trying to push his players
[8878.00 - 8880.00] P:1295.40 E:0.065072 |  as far forward as he possibly can.
[8880.00 - 8882.00] P:1062.43 E:0.049795 |  Robin's going to take this free-kick.
[8882.00 - 8884.00] P:1332.47 E:0.055855 |  Lambs nearby.
[8884.00 - 8886.00] P:1040.74 E:0.039939 |  Well, they've plenty of aerial targets
[8886.00 - 8888.00] P:1271.49 E:0.063259 |  inside the Chelsea penalty area.
[8888.00 - 8890.00] P:1368.12 E:0.049176 |  Chelsea, come on.
[8890.00 - 8892.00] P:1616.22 E:0.057645 |  Defends tightly.
[8892.00 - 8894.00] P:1248.32 E:0.043545 |  Less than five minutes to go.
[8894.00 - 8896.00] P:1232.62 E:0.053795 |  Robin waits. The referee's happy.
[8896.00 - 8898.00] P:1722.88 E:0.044529 |  Robin still waits.
[8898.00 - 8900.00] P:1737.95 E:0.028299 |  Is he going to get on with it finally?
[8900.00 - 8902.00] P:1775.65 E:0.055902 |  Finally, he does.
[8902.00 - 8904.00] P:1768.66 E:0.044723 |  And he flicks it in too deep.
[8904.00 - 8906.00] P:1737.50 E:0.051937 |  Straight into the arm to check.
[8906.00 - 8908.00] P:1643.06 E:0.063001 |  Local free-kick.
[8908.00 - 8910.00] P:1765.55 E:0.035296 |  Absolute waste.
[8910.00 - 8912.00] P:1554.10 E:0.039582 |  Well, we talked about Robbery.
[8912.00 - 8914.00] P:1367.25 E:0.043070 |  That's Ribbery and Robin
[8914.00 - 8916.00] P:1420.78 E:0.052805 |  before the game. Actually, they haven't contributed
[8916.00 - 8918.00] P:1527.95 E:0.061212 |  a great deal.
[8918.00 - 8920.00] P:1354.85 E:0.054338 |  On the far side of the field.
[8920.00 - 8922.00] P:1308.64 E:0.038709 |  It's with Bersingua.
[8922.00 - 8924.00] P:1450.99 E:0.059004 |  Bersingua then retreats, goes back to the halfway line,
[8924.00 - 8926.00] P:1430.72 E:0.057500 |  plays it to Cahill.
[8926.00 - 8928.00] P:1381.65 E:0.057696 |  On to Louise. The ball can't go out
[8928.00 - 8930.00] P:1405.63 E:0.040327 |  for Ferrero to get on.
[8930.00 - 8932.00] P:1171.35 E:0.032425 |  They don't want to
[8932.00 - 8934.00] P:1299.97 E:0.044607 |  knock it out of play unnecessarily.
[8934.00 - 8936.00] P:1476.63 E:0.055466 |  But they've lost the ball.
[8936.00 - 8938.00] P:1382.50 E:0.046705 |  Actually, it's a free-kick now.
[8938.00 - 8940.00] P:1598.88 E:0.055150 |  And here surely is the change.
[8940.00 - 8942.00] P:1696.62 E:0.050467 |  Yeah, and Byte has gone down as well.
[8942.00 - 8944.00] P:1601.22 E:0.062041 |  Well, where is Ferrero?
[8946.00 - 8948.00] P:1698.09 E:0.059654 |  Can't see him now.
[8948.00 - 8950.00] P:1823.22 E:0.059279 |  But Byte is down.
[8950.00 - 8952.00] P:1938.15 E:0.042702 |  And what's
[8952.00 - 8954.00] P:1844.27 E:0.067655 |  lawyer doing? He rushes out of his penalty area.
[8954.00 - 8956.00] P:1757.29 E:0.067088 |  Is he getting the physios off?
[8956.00 - 8958.00] P:1830.85 E:0.036780 |  Right.
[8958.00 - 8960.00] P:1872.24 E:0.073125 |  He's getting his own physios off.
[8960.00 - 8962.00] P:1861.30 E:0.051415 |  Say, don't come on, don't come on.
[8962.00 - 8964.00] P:1830.24 E:0.059874 |  He's got half minutes to go. Where is Ferrero?
[8964.00 - 8966.00] P:1985.06 E:0.042403 |  Why is Neone?
[8966.00 - 8968.00] P:1968.84 E:0.045556 |  Free-kick's already taken.
[8968.00 - 8970.00] P:1976.93 E:0.026107 |  Change.
[8970.00 - 8972.00] P:1754.44 E:0.062196 |  Contento. I just wanted to...
[8972.00 - 8974.00] P:1742.55 E:0.044434 |  Sorry, I wonder where the Cahill said I'm fine.
[8974.00 - 8976.00] P:1651.65 E:0.037912 |  I'm absolutely fine. Leave it.
[8976.00 - 8978.00] P:1451.19 E:0.047971 |  Right, Schveinsteiger.
[8978.00 - 8980.00] P:1565.84 E:0.047811 |  On to Timershield, back to Kroos, inside the centre circle.
[8980.00 - 8982.00] P:1531.81 E:0.059108 |  That helped on towards this near side.
[8982.00 - 8984.00] P:1212.57 E:0.064055 |  The Bayern right in the remaining minutes
[8984.00 - 8986.00] P:1529.72 E:0.062968 |  of the 2012 Champions League final.
[8986.00 - 8988.00] P:1408.99 E:0.055924 |  Robin cuts in from the right side.
[8988.00 - 8990.00] P:1471.74 E:0.048366 |  Doesn't find Gomez.
[8990.00 - 8992.00] P:1638.56 E:0.061214 |  He's cleared by a tired-looking Luis.
[8992.00 - 8994.00] P:1359.42 E:0.056916 |  It bounces once before, clears the near-touch line
[8994.00 - 8996.00] P:1235.37 E:0.045449 |  and it's out of play
[8996.00 - 8998.00] P:1336.21 E:0.051559 |  for a throw-in to Bayern Munich.
[9000.00 - 9002.00] P:1439.98 E:0.067655 |  Well, we didn't think we were going to get a goal
[9002.00 - 9004.00] P:1556.70 E:0.053449 |  at any stage, and then suddenly
[9004.00 - 9006.00] P:1491.35 E:0.053299 |  Muller headed
[9006.00 - 9008.00] P:1565.30 E:0.061278 |  Bayern in front, and then we didn't think we were going to get
[9008.00 - 9010.00] P:1556.58 E:0.060415 |  an equaliser, but Drucker powered
[9010.00 - 9012.00] P:1661.72 E:0.054887 |  in a wonderful header from Chelsea's first corner
[9012.00 - 9014.00] P:1713.16 E:0.042753 |  of the game.
[9014.00 - 9016.00] P:1764.47 E:0.062369 |  I don't think either side's going to score now,
[9016.00 - 9018.00] P:1553.32 E:0.055915 |  so that's probably the signal for one under to score.
[9018.00 - 9020.00] P:1490.30 E:0.048360 |  Well, this isn't the strepica of what
[9020.00 - 9022.00] P:1489.78 E:0.051809 |  I'm going to have in Grant, the sort of tempering charge,
[9022.00 - 9024.00] P:1191.31 E:0.050028 |  isn't it?
[9024.00 - 9026.00] P:1445.26 E:0.049515 |  Here's Robin.
[9026.00 - 9028.00] P:1492.35 E:0.056885 |  Robin steps inside of Cole, then he's tackled
[9028.00 - 9030.00] P:1278.83 E:0.046299 |  with the ball breaks back to Lamm.
[9030.00 - 9032.00] P:1169.79 E:0.040227 |  Lamm on to Robin.
[9032.00 - 9034.00] P:1182.85 E:0.041359 |  Robin again, doesn't cross the ball.
[9034.00 - 9036.00] P:1440.71 E:0.053294 |  Wants to walk it in, but he feeds it back.
[9036.00 - 9038.00] P:1510.15 E:0.062153 |  And here's Timershield, shooting from long range.
[9038.00 - 9040.00] P:1587.91 E:0.053101 |  Hits a Chelsea player, Miguel.
[9040.00 - 9042.00] P:1472.31 E:0.059526 |  Rebounds the Torres.
[9042.00 - 9044.00] P:1425.31 E:0.060933 |  Torres was tackled there by Olic and the ball breaks
[9044.00 - 9046.00] P:1580.06 E:0.050450 |  out of play and it's going to be a throw-in to Chelsea.
[9046.00 - 9048.00] P:1645.56 E:0.052471 |  And here's the ball, and the Torres was watching it.
[9048.00 - 9050.00] P:1558.17 E:0.060402 |  He was.
[9050.00 - 9052.00] P:1508.11 E:0.070595 |  He's not entirely comfortable in that right-sided midfield
[9052.00 - 9054.00] P:1625.00 E:0.056581 |  roll, when he has to defend.
[9054.00 - 9056.00] P:1606.49 E:0.063832 |  It's a bit hair-and-scare-er.
[9056.00 - 9058.00] P:1624.41 E:0.068094 |  Two minutes to go, and the slow pace with which
[9058.00 - 9060.00] P:1857.96 E:0.059530 |  Bersink was going to the far touch,
[9060.00 - 9062.00] P:1754.12 E:0.066011 |  takes this throw-in,
[9062.00 - 9064.00] P:1745.54 E:0.062519 |  makes me think Chelsea want penalties.
[9064.00 - 9066.00] P:1663.37 E:0.057933 |  I bet the corporate punter's never seen
[9066.00 - 9068.00] P:1616.03 E:0.053983 |  so many minutes of football.
[9068.00 - 9070.00] P:1180.67 E:0.045981 |  They look at the watchers,
[9070.00 - 9072.00] P:1531.73 E:0.051658 |  they're like, what is this?
[9072.00 - 9074.00] P:1681.72 E:0.066912 |  I've got this game to finish by now.
[9074.00 - 9076.00] P:1585.13 E:0.052131 |  It's supposed to finish in 90 minutes.
[9076.00 - 9078.00] P:1177.90 E:0.066858 |  You know, there's a glass of champagne waiting for me.
[9078.00 - 9080.00] P:1151.55 E:0.069176 |  30,000 on.
[9080.00 - 9082.00] P:999.55 E:0.055731 |  And some prongs.
[9082.00 - 9084.00] P:1268.96 E:0.077346 |  Chelsea's throw-in succeeded
[9084.00 - 9086.00] P:1110.52 E:0.072893 |  in moving in a bit closer to the halfway line.
[9086.00 - 9088.00] P:1428.20 E:0.062159 |  They've got another throw-in, a minute and a quarter to go.
[9088.00 - 9090.00] P:1599.08 E:0.067634 |  It's the Chelsea fans you hear
[9090.00 - 9092.00] P:1207.55 E:0.056662 |  singing at the moment.
[9092.00 - 9094.00] P:1138.73 E:0.068281 |  Miguel.
[9094.00 - 9096.00] P:1124.76 E:0.062037 |  Talampar, back to Cahill.
[9096.00 - 9098.00] P:1608.94 E:0.061663 |  And now Luis.
[9098.00 - 9100.00] P:975.42 E:0.070831 |  Luis onto Cole.
[9100.00 - 9102.00] P:1572.50 E:0.065788 |  By the way, the shot we saw, the short time he goes,
[9102.00 - 9104.00] P:1534.36 E:0.059273 |  the long-term, Terry was in a track suit.
[9104.00 - 9106.00] P:1456.09 E:0.059040 |  Get earlier shots of him in the game,
[9106.00 - 9108.00] P:1347.52 E:0.053701 |  had him wearing a suit.
[9108.00 - 9110.00] P:1317.32 E:0.060960 |  Terry is planning to go up
[9110.00 - 9112.00] P:1317.12 E:0.051637 |  to get the trophy.
[9112.00 - 9114.00] P:1182.62 E:0.039917 |  If Chelsea win.
[9114.00 - 9116.00] P:1417.90 E:0.057566 |  Here, they've got the ball on the other side of the field
[9116.00 - 9118.00] P:1455.65 E:0.047772 |  with Maluda. Left side for Chelsea.
[9118.00 - 9120.00] P:1292.10 E:0.056868 |  Midway inside the bar and half,
[9120.00 - 9122.00] P:1320.18 E:0.057716 |  inside the final minute of extra time.
[9122.00 - 9124.00] P:1434.54 E:0.059789 |  Back to Lampard. Lampard switches play to the far side.
[9124.00 - 9126.00] P:1359.46 E:0.058443 |  Taking on the chest by Torres.
[9126.00 - 9128.00] P:1537.17 E:0.064833 |  Torres runs forward, he must be fresh.
[9128.00 - 9130.00] P:1302.82 E:0.069625 |  He's past contento, into the penalty area
[9130.00 - 9132.00] P:1331.18 E:0.069564 |  and he's called a bar and defender.
[9132.00 - 9134.00] P:1523.57 E:0.062719 |  And it's a free kick.
[9134.00 - 9136.00] P:1429.38 E:0.059224 |  He's going to get booked as well.
[9136.00 - 9138.00] P:1416.41 E:0.062289 |  He didn't think he'd fouled contento, did he?
[9138.00 - 9140.00] P:1522.37 E:0.060935 |  But he's running away,
[9140.00 - 9142.00] P:1565.39 E:0.054485 |  knowing he's going to get booked.
[9142.00 - 9144.00] P:1442.72 E:0.055669 |  Drogba needs to stay away from the ref as well.
[9144.00 - 9146.00] P:1535.36 E:0.063459 |  Don't get sent off again.
[9146.00 - 9148.00] P:1618.73 E:0.067885 |  Don't be doing that, did he?
[9148.00 - 9150.00] P:1741.93 E:0.077921 |  Painful memory of Moscow
[9150.00 - 9152.00] P:1857.94 E:0.071400 |  should be enough for Didier Drogba.
[9152.00 - 9154.00] P:1862.47 E:0.063775 |  He's still complaining of the referee, get away.
[9154.00 - 9156.00] P:1757.82 E:0.048987 |  It is, unquestionably, a free kick.
[9156.00 - 9158.00] P:1661.64 E:0.052962 |  Good job, you can't lip-read in Spanish, by the way.
[9158.00 - 9160.00] P:1610.87 E:0.058590 |  Well, I think he did foul the player.
[9160.00 - 9162.00] P:1219.08 E:0.047417 |  We've had our 15 minutes,
[9162.00 - 9165.00] P:1438.00 E:0.067405 |  the lot of 15 minutes of the second period of extra time.
[9165.00 - 9168.00] P:1549.68 E:0.062215 |  I doubt it's a referee to lay us much longer.
[9168.00 - 9170.00] P:1558.13 E:0.054296 |  We are heading for penalties.
[9170.00 - 9172.00] P:1652.27 E:0.057535 |  We are now going to penalties.
[9172.00 - 9174.00] P:1571.93 E:0.070681 |  Oh!
[9174.00 - 9176.00] P:1578.10 E:0.048859 |  Oh!
[9176.00 - 9178.00] P:1455.41 E:0.054974 |  Wow, this is just a lottery element of the game, isn't it?
[9178.00 - 9180.00] P:1419.20 E:0.051073 |  Absolutely.
[9180.00 - 9182.00] P:1386.75 E:0.059724 |  I would give Robin all five penalties for Barney.
[9182.00 - 9184.00] P:1326.37 E:0.049070 |  All five penalties for Barney.
[9184.00 - 9186.00] P:1340.53 E:0.071994 |  He's a great player,
[9186.00 - 9188.00] P:1338.10 E:0.058057 |  but he's not going to play the penalties for Barney.
[9188.00 - 9190.00] P:1182.80 E:0.055152 |  All five of them.
[9190.00 - 9192.00] P:1240.78 E:0.055057 |  It's finished 1-1.
[9192.00 - 9194.00] P:1297.59 E:0.056890 |  Well, you know, I was just wanting from Charles's point of view,
[9194.00 - 9196.00] P:1538.28 E:0.046364 |  Mullahs obviously can't take one, can he?
[9196.00 - 9198.00] P:1477.61 E:0.057787 |  I'm clenching its drawers a little bit.
[9198.00 - 9200.00] P:1468.49 E:0.056000 |  You know what normally happens with Germans
[9200.00 - 9202.00] P:1414.08 E:0.063292 |  in terms of penalty shootouts,
[9202.00 - 9204.00] P:1625.99 E:0.065496 |  but Charles, you just need to be strong here.
[9204.00 - 9206.00] P:1578.24 E:0.054200 |  We'll see.
[9206.00 - 9208.00] P:1707.90 E:0.070132 |  The thing is, of course,
[9208.00 - 9210.00] P:1541.39 E:0.063869 |  Lampard will take one, Terros will take one,
[9210.00 - 9212.00] P:1516.84 E:0.049749 |  Drogba will take one,
[9212.00 - 9214.00] P:1708.68 E:0.053294 |  Matta will take one, wouldn't he, you think?
[9214.00 - 9216.00] P:1671.79 E:0.063119 |  Oh, yes, definitely.
[9216.00 - 9218.00] P:1761.78 E:0.045788 |  And Robbins Langen is back now,
[9218.00 - 9220.00] P:1547.18 E:0.062136 |  and he's thinking, do I have to take one?
[9220.00 - 9222.00] P:1613.57 E:0.035236 |  We'll see.
[9222.00 - 9224.00] P:1648.45 E:0.063738 |  Mark, it's all yours for the moment.
[9224.00 - 9226.00] P:2058.85 E:0.062865 |  Well, I wonder why that's...
[9226.00 - 9228.00] P:1812.71 E:0.063711 |  As much as anything, why Matta stayed on,
[9228.00 - 9230.00] P:1775.95 E:0.054324 |  maybe Ferreira didn't come on,
[9230.00 - 9232.00] P:2052.18 E:0.062995 |  because Matta can take a penalty.
[9232.00 - 9234.00] P:1855.96 E:0.052282 |  Steve, what is crucial now,
[9234.00 - 9236.00] P:1889.06 E:0.072381 |  and that she might mention this at lunchtime,
[9236.00 - 9238.00] P:1926.47 E:0.054167 |  Mike Ingram, which end will they take the penalties?
[9238.00 - 9240.00] P:1975.61 E:0.056452 |  Away to our right, the massive Byn Munich fans,
[9240.00 - 9242.00] P:1932.58 E:0.058531 |  away to our left, Chelsea fans,
[9242.00 - 9244.00] P:1988.93 E:0.063866 |  so that is going to be absolutely crucial as well.
[9244.00 - 9246.00] P:1998.90 E:0.066833 |  Could it be that Chelsea, after this season of all seasons,
[9246.00 - 9248.00] P:1693.03 E:0.060233 |  are going to win the European Cup
[9248.00 - 9250.00] P:1894.66 E:0.054758 |  on penalties against a German team in Germany?
[9250.00 - 9252.00] P:1752.88 E:0.052284 |  Well, we've spoken about it,
[9252.00 - 9254.00] P:1777.14 E:0.068816 |  we've spoken about it for 24, 48 hours,
[9254.00 - 9256.00] P:1834.75 E:0.048607 |  and is it our turn, is it our turn
[9256.00 - 9258.00] P:1827.19 E:0.065311 |  to get one over on the Germans?
[9258.00 - 9260.00] P:1816.93 E:0.056234 |  How many times have we been in this situation,
[9260.00 - 9262.00] P:1749.15 E:0.056496 |  and we've come unstuck?
[9262.00 - 9264.00] P:1888.53 E:0.055617 |  We've never managed to quite do it.
[9264.00 - 9266.00] P:1939.50 E:0.066011 |  Let's hope, let's hope now,
[9266.00 - 9268.00] P:2014.35 E:0.061180 |  there's a lot of tired, tired bodies there,
[9268.00 - 9270.00] P:1949.80 E:0.056332 |  and it's now vitally important
[9270.00 - 9272.00] P:2147.07 E:0.052619 |  that you keep your concentration,
[9272.00 - 9274.00] P:2079.88 E:0.057333 |  make sure that you concentrate, don't lose focus,
[9274.00 - 9276.00] P:1996.09 E:0.053795 |  and make sure that when you're taking a penalty,
[9276.00 - 9278.00] P:1960.97 E:0.051264 |  do one thing, don't change your mind.
[9278.00 - 9280.00] P:1732.91 E:0.054047 |  Pick your spot now, where you're going to put it,
[9280.00 - 9282.00] P:1709.49 E:0.053930 |  and make sure that nothing changes from that situation.
[9282.00 - 9284.00] P:1837.16 E:0.055927 |  We just saw a shot there
[9284.00 - 9286.00] P:1615.32 E:0.068834 |  of Roberto Di Matteo
[9286.00 - 9288.00] P:1724.56 E:0.068021 |  writing out his list.
[9288.00 - 9290.00] P:1694.88 E:0.059928 |  It looked like he was writing a shopping list.
[9290.00 - 9292.00] P:1873.28 E:0.063897 |  He could have been writing eggs, bacon, milk bread,
[9292.00 - 9294.00] P:1689.44 E:0.063796 |  and he was probably writing, obviously,
[9294.00 - 9296.00] P:1574.78 E:0.058184 |  lampard, matter, etc.
[9296.00 - 9298.00] P:1345.44 E:0.057494 |  I'm going to go for lampard, of course,
[9298.00 - 9300.00] P:1524.98 E:0.055203 |  drug bar, of course,
[9300.00 - 9302.00] P:1564.30 E:0.047574 |  Torres, matter, and Ashley Cole, remember,
[9302.00 - 9304.00] P:1409.78 E:0.054074 |  scored the penalty back a few years ago.
[9304.00 - 9306.00] P:1589.80 E:0.068422 |  Lampard, of course, missed a penalty for England
[9306.00 - 9308.00] P:1706.36 E:0.067900 |  here in Germany, didn't he, in a 2006 shootout
[9308.00 - 9310.00] P:1735.85 E:0.067407 |  against the Portuguese?
[9310.00 - 9312.00] P:1536.82 E:0.065015 |  Well, a lot of people think
[9312.00 - 9314.00] P:1516.59 E:0.066875 |  that astrology or fate,
[9314.00 - 9316.00] P:1629.15 E:0.070118 |  or whatever you call it, an absolute bunk of...
[9316.00 - 9318.00] P:1664.37 E:0.070546 |  and it may be absolute bunk of...
[9318.00 - 9320.00] P:1825.34 E:0.065279 |  but I'll tell you what, they've got this far, Chelsea, somehow.
[9320.00 - 9322.00] P:1235.21 E:0.069048 |  Well, we've said no for the best part
[9322.00 - 9324.00] P:1404.11 E:0.071573 |  of the week, into the build-up of it.
[9324.00 - 9326.00] P:1461.68 E:0.061714 |  Is it Chelsea?
[9326.00 - 9328.00] P:1591.54 E:0.070994 |  Is it a reward for these great players who've played
[9328.00 - 9330.00] P:1609.46 E:0.064059 |  for Chelsea? Ashley Cole tonight
[9330.00 - 9333.00] P:1453.52 E:0.069711 |  has given an absolutely wonderful, wonderful performance
[9333.00 - 9336.00] P:1479.80 E:0.066861 |  and deserves to be in a winning team.
[9336.00 - 9339.00] P:1663.33 E:0.067220 |  Year in and year out, he keeps the same standards at that,
[9339.00 - 9341.00] P:1496.95 E:0.060801 |  and I'm particularly impressed with him tonight.
[9341.00 - 9344.00] P:1502.80 E:0.060496 |  And I have to say, Pisinga has been much maligned.
[9344.00 - 9346.00] P:1541.10 E:0.064647 |  He was terrific, too.
[9346.00 - 9348.00] P:1314.48 E:0.050846 |  When there was a lot of people flagging towards the end,
[9348.00 - 9350.00] P:1514.24 E:0.060118 |  he seemed to still have a little yard in his step,
[9350.00 - 9352.00] P:1217.01 E:0.053511 |  well done to him.
[9352.00 - 9354.00] P:1551.19 E:0.059350 |  They got very predictable, didn't they, Bayern Munich?
[9354.00 - 9356.00] P:1546.37 E:0.062009 |  Really, Robyn, cutting off the right-hand side,
[9356.00 - 9358.00] P:1803.33 E:0.064622 |  and we said it at the same time as Alan.
[9358.00 - 9360.00] P:1563.94 E:0.064211 |  We said it to each other. There's the same time as Alan
[9360.00 - 9362.00] P:1491.64 E:0.056499 |  said in commentary. How many times has he done that tonight?
[9362.00 - 9364.00] P:1554.68 E:0.065591 |  How many times did Robyn come in on his left foot
[9364.00 - 9366.00] P:1400.44 E:0.065067 |  and then try and either play one, two,
[9366.00 - 9368.00] P:1480.80 E:0.059950 |  or he hit it into the crowd?
[9368.00 - 9371.00] P:1368.24 E:0.057328 |  I mean, has he now got the ability
[9371.00 - 9374.00] P:1446.97 E:0.061312 |  to go and take a penalty, which is going to rack with him now?
[9374.00 - 9376.00] P:1527.46 E:0.070779 |  Is he going to take it? Here we are.
[9376.00 - 9378.00] P:1771.87 E:0.071875 |  Look at Philipp Lahm, he's in.
[9378.00 - 9380.00] P:1702.79 E:0.062214 |  Philipp Lahm, the Bayern Munich captain,
[9380.00 - 9382.00] P:1767.46 E:0.062780 |  is shaking his fists in the huddle, as if to say,
[9382.00 - 9385.00] P:1719.35 E:0.068069 |  we are a German team, predominantly German players in Germany.
[9385.00 - 9388.00] P:1683.55 E:0.073043 |  We don't lose penalty shootouts,
[9388.00 - 9390.00] P:1582.29 E:0.063361 |  especially not against an English team.
[9390.00 - 9393.00] P:1540.19 E:0.063111 |  And not against an English team? Let's hope it's our night.
[9393.00 - 9396.00] P:1481.05 E:0.071556 |  It comes a lottery, you have to say that mentality over the years
[9396.00 - 9398.00] P:1500.21 E:0.073293 |  has obviously been better than ours.
[9398.00 - 9401.00] P:1449.18 E:0.074153 |  I think these Chelsea lads will do it.
[9401.00 - 9405.00] P:1568.02 E:0.072260 |  Look at Betachek out there, a man all alone with his thoughts.
[9405.00 - 9408.00] P:1739.76 E:0.070338 |  There are no other Chelsea players anywhere near him,
[9408.00 - 9411.00] P:1625.23 E:0.065957 |  no other Chelsea players even attempting to have a conversation with him.
[9411.00 - 9413.00] P:1715.30 E:0.070523 |  A man alone with his thoughts.
[9413.00 - 9416.00] P:1758.02 E:0.059122 |  Now Mikhail comes over and gives him a high five,
[9416.00 - 9418.00] P:1793.33 E:0.060883 |  and Czech and Lampard and Drogba and Ashley Cole,
[9418.00 - 9420.00] P:1743.05 E:0.052406 |  and that generation must be thinking
[9420.00 - 9422.00] P:1647.64 E:0.062486 |  we cannot lose two finals on penalties, surely.
[9422.00 - 9424.00] P:1767.89 E:0.064196 |  Well, it would be cruel if they did.
[9424.00 - 9427.00] P:1792.53 E:0.062756 |  You're right, the two goalkeepers are wonderful, wonderful goalkeepers.
[9427.00 - 9429.00] P:1673.29 E:0.058136 |  Neuer in the goal as well for Germany
[9429.00 - 9432.00] P:1668.01 E:0.054631 |  is a really, really top-class goalkeeper.
[9432.00 - 9435.00] P:1713.61 E:0.065996 |  And so is Petr Cech. Let's hope that they can hold their nerve.
[9435.00 - 9438.00] P:1549.17 E:0.063983 |  Let's hope they've got the concentration levels right.
[9438.00 - 9440.00] P:1550.02 E:0.056782 |  As much as if Lampard's right to take the first one,
[9440.00 - 9443.00] P:1461.68 E:0.051428 |  I would have thought, let's hope he can get us off to a good start.
[9443.00 - 9447.00] P:1781.31 E:0.059303 |  For the third time tonight, Lampard and Lampard shake hands.
[9447.00 - 9449.00] P:1744.58 E:0.065962 |  They shook hands at the beginning of the game.
[9449.00 - 9451.00] P:1528.00 E:0.048780 |  Crucial. This is crucial.
[9451.00 - 9453.00] P:1911.57 E:0.062733 |  This for me is crucial. If it's at the Chelsea end,
[9453.00 - 9455.00] P:1699.05 E:0.061534 |  it's a huge, huge advantage.
[9455.00 - 9458.00] P:1488.23 E:0.058474 |  Let's hope Frank picks heads and gets it right.
[9458.00 - 9460.00] P:1797.89 E:0.067848 |  I think the referee's actually not giving them a choice.
[9460.00 - 9462.00] P:1549.09 E:0.074718 |  I think the way he's been pointing, he's gone.
[9462.00 - 9466.00] P:1575.76 E:0.064563 |  If it's this way and if it's that way, it's that way.
[9466.00 - 9467.00] P:1390.00 E:0.057509 |  By an end.
[9467.00 - 9470.00] P:1693.41 E:0.069099 |  It looks like it's the by an end, the way that the referee has pointed.
[9470.00 - 9473.00] P:1527.06 E:0.052461 |  I think it's the by an end.
[9473.00 - 9475.00] P:1385.84 E:0.078861 |  And now the referee is going through all the preliminaries
[9475.00 - 9478.00] P:1584.81 E:0.068349 |  about what is happening, but certainly the referee
[9478.00 - 9480.00] P:1853.52 E:0.068799 |  gestured towards our right.
[9480.00 - 9484.00] P:1737.65 E:0.056696 |  Oh, hang on. Is it best of three? He's tossed the coin again.
[9484.00 - 9486.00] P:1739.85 E:0.061104 |  Now what's going on here?
[9486.00 - 9488.00] P:1777.03 E:0.066578 |  They hand shakes the game between the captains.
[9488.00 - 9492.00] P:1606.43 E:0.051707 |  They definitely tossed the coin twice.
[9492.00 - 9495.00] P:1581.37 E:0.068107 |  And we still don't know which end it's going to be exactly.
[9495.00 - 9497.00] P:1652.30 E:0.063557 |  Looks like the by an end, doesn't it?
[9497.00 - 9499.00] P:1597.44 E:0.074816 |  And the pin is going first.
[9499.00 - 9500.00] P:1550.87 E:0.065132 |  And who's gone first?
[9500.00 - 9502.00] P:1605.76 E:0.072462 |  Apparently you have a 60-40 better chance of winning
[9502.00 - 9504.00] P:1598.42 E:0.067667 |  statistically if you take the first penalty.
[9504.00 - 9507.00] P:1675.58 E:0.063009 |  Hey Ho, who knows what that means?
[9507.00 - 9509.00] P:1743.91 E:0.069787 |  So Mike, here we go then.
[9509.00 - 9514.00] P:1756.43 E:0.065083 |  Is this to be Chelsea's night in the most dramatic fashion?
[9514.00 - 9516.00] P:1533.18 E:0.079552 |  Ladies and gentlemen...
[9516.00 - 9519.00] P:1385.98 E:0.074498 |  I'll just give you a name.
[9519.00 - 9521.00] P:1418.12 E:0.065803 |  Harry Redner.
[9521.00 - 9524.00] P:1404.86 E:0.075719 |  Because you know, this penalty shootout is obviously all about...
[9524.00 - 9527.00] P:1592.69 E:0.061912 |  Chelsea's search for the Champions League,
[9527.00 - 9531.00] P:1518.64 E:0.065889 |  but of course Chelsea are successful in this penalty shootout.
[9531.00 - 9535.00] P:1578.94 E:0.054123 |  Tottenham will not be in the Champions League next season.
[9535.00 - 9539.00] P:1623.75 E:0.056774 |  So I don't think I've ever seen an English team
[9539.00 - 9541.00] P:1637.25 E:0.063955 |  be a German team on penalties.
[9541.00 - 9544.00] P:1584.78 E:0.060171 |  In Moscow, as the Chelsea players go into a huddle,
[9544.00 - 9547.00] P:1336.25 E:0.066901 |  you may remember Lampard, Ashley Cole and Kalu,
[9547.00 - 9549.00] P:1504.86 E:0.051786 |  all scored from penalties.
[9549.00 - 9552.00] P:1566.96 E:0.047918 |  And in the semi-final,
[9552.00 - 9554.00] P:1604.06 E:0.068301 |  Bayern Munich against Real Madrid,
[9554.00 - 9556.00] P:1547.97 E:0.055071 |  Kruse and LaM missed.
[9556.00 - 9560.00] P:1416.67 E:0.049788 |  Schweinsteiger and Gomez scored.
[9560.00 - 9564.00] P:1575.62 E:0.055624 |  But despite that, LaM, having missed the penalty in Madrid,
[9564.00 - 9567.00] P:1725.50 E:0.050567 |  is going to lead from the front here.
[9567.00 - 9569.00] P:1754.33 E:0.053625 |  But Bayern Munich captain,
[9569.00 - 9572.00] P:1567.01 E:0.061567 |  and it is, as we've been saying, at the Bayern end,
[9572.00 - 9574.00] P:1674.33 E:0.054575 |  so he's getting absolute encouragement,
[9574.00 - 9578.00] P:1678.56 E:0.060319 |  as Czeck tries to make himself as big as possible
[9578.00 - 9581.00] P:1658.38 E:0.055129 |  in that Chelsea goal away to our right.
[9581.00 - 9585.00] P:1699.85 E:0.056777 |  Remember, LaM did miss in the semi-final.
[9585.00 - 9587.00] P:1771.66 E:0.071743 |  Here he comes with Bayern's first penalty,
[9587.00 - 9591.00] P:1421.81 E:0.068725 |  and he tucks it away into the corner,
[9591.00 - 9594.00] P:1417.74 E:0.063080 |  and Bayern lead 1-0.
[9594.00 - 9597.00] P:1665.45 E:0.066684 |  Yeah, I think it's always important that he score the first one,
[9597.00 - 9599.00] P:1579.03 E:0.065801 |  Mike Czeck wasn't that far away from that,
[9599.00 - 9601.00] P:1455.60 E:0.071716 |  was he? Got a hand to it, a right hand,
[9601.00 - 9604.00] P:1646.72 E:0.046926 |  a little bit unfortunate, actually.
[9604.00 - 9607.00] P:1748.94 E:0.057643 |  It's no one matter for Chelsea.
[9607.00 - 9609.00] P:1846.98 E:0.064588 |  Bayern have the lead,
[9609.00 - 9614.00] P:1945.26 E:0.070958 |  but it can be eradicated if Matta scores.
[9614.00 - 9618.00] P:1939.94 E:0.066734 |  Neuer, who's saved from Ronaldo and from Cacar
[9618.00 - 9622.00] P:1926.53 E:0.064063 |  in the semi-final, should out against Real Madrid.
[9622.00 - 9626.00] P:1902.21 E:0.064635 |  Has not a great deal to do in the game.
[9626.00 - 9628.00] P:1783.83 E:0.077374 |  He's bunching up and down in the line.
[9628.00 - 9630.00] P:1865.58 E:0.063726 |  Matta's going to hit it left-footed.
[9630.00 - 9634.00] P:1791.18 E:0.070350 |  Come on, Matta. There it goes! Oh, it's saved!
[9634.00 - 9636.00] P:1584.46 E:0.074962 |  It's saved! It was a poor penalty,
[9636.00 - 9639.00] P:1368.97 E:0.069377 |  and Neuer got his body to block it,
[9639.00 - 9642.00] P:1519.94 E:0.065228 |  and the advantage is with Bayern Munich.
[9642.00 - 9644.00] P:1485.67 E:0.068467 |  There's always an unlimited guesswork,
[9644.00 - 9646.00] P:1690.84 E:0.066518 |  and he just guessed right, Neuer,
[9646.00 - 9650.00] P:1512.12 E:0.065612 |  but now he was going in some sort of five or six feet from the post
[9650.00 - 9653.00] P:1412.03 E:0.059193 |  to poor penalty from Matta.
[9653.00 - 9655.00] P:1489.55 E:0.073178 |  The worst possible start for Chelsea.
[9655.00 - 9658.00] P:1462.94 E:0.071605 |  Mario Gomez, 12 goals in the Champions League this season.
[9658.00 - 9661.00] P:1479.88 E:0.062158 |  Mr. Sitter here tonight in normal play.
[9661.00 - 9663.00] P:1587.52 E:0.072817 |  He did score a penalty in the semi-final.
[9663.00 - 9665.00] P:1679.19 E:0.069237 |  He's normally a very cool customer.
[9665.00 - 9668.00] P:1792.45 E:0.063707 |  He wants to get on with it, check his waiting,
[9668.00 - 9671.00] P:1721.24 E:0.073514 |  and here comes Gomez, and Gomez very calmly
[9671.00 - 9674.00] P:1347.93 E:0.073563 |  once more puts it in the same part of the net
[9674.00 - 9676.00] P:1389.35 E:0.069861 |  that Philippe Larn found as well,
[9676.00 - 9678.00] P:1503.27 E:0.067088 |  and Bayern have scored both of theirs.
[9678.00 - 9681.00] P:1595.65 E:0.065096 |  That's probably the best penalty of the three so far, Mike.
[9681.00 - 9684.00] P:1520.72 E:0.066386 |  Low keepers left. No chance to save it.
[9684.00 - 9688.00] P:1657.87 E:0.070997 |  I'm not sure many would have had David Luiz on the list to take a penalty.
[9688.00 - 9690.00] P:1875.32 E:0.073580 |  I bet he scores, Alan.
[9690.00 - 9692.00] P:1936.74 E:0.074051 |  I hope you're right.
[9692.00 - 9694.00] P:1935.11 E:0.075533 |  And here is the Brazilian.
[9694.00 - 9697.00] P:1911.48 E:0.069318 |  And Neuer is so animated.
[9697.00 - 9699.00] P:1946.48 E:0.064261 |  He's already saved once.
[9699.00 - 9703.00] P:1885.33 E:0.068848 |  He thinks Bayern are closing in on a fifth European Cup
[9703.00 - 9705.00] P:1939.26 E:0.059521 |  Stroke Champions League.
[9705.00 - 9708.00] P:1842.50 E:0.070030 |  It's a mighty run-up for David Luiz to take it.
[9708.00 - 9710.00] P:1846.95 E:0.073841 |  Here he comes, shooting right foot in.
[9710.00 - 9712.00] P:1517.65 E:0.070914 |  Great penalty.
[9712.00 - 9714.00] P:1668.62 E:0.073426 |  Back to 2-1. Just always fan-tied him.
[9714.00 - 9716.00] P:1634.52 E:0.068305 |  Oh, I just think he loves the limelight,
[9716.00 - 9718.00] P:1720.93 E:0.056423 |  loves a big occasion.
[9718.00 - 9720.00] P:1479.04 E:0.065482 |  The spotlight, call it what you will.
[9720.00 - 9724.00] P:1478.74 E:0.057468 |  But Chelsea now need a Bayern miss, really.
[9724.00 - 9727.00] P:1296.00 E:0.061935 |  Because Bayern are rolling on here
[9727.00 - 9730.00] P:1435.93 E:0.063540 |  as they always do these German sides.
[9730.00 - 9733.00] P:1391.23 E:0.056505 |  Nobody's stepping forward at the moment to take a Bayern penalty.
[9733.00 - 9735.00] P:1697.21 E:0.052976 |  There's confusion here.
[9735.00 - 9737.00] P:1682.01 E:0.055787 |  Neuer is going to take it.
[9737.00 - 9740.00] P:1694.56 E:0.064188 |  Well, of course, but who's the deputy goalkeeper.
[9740.00 - 9742.00] P:1556.02 E:0.063853 |  Also takes a brilliant penalty.
[9742.00 - 9744.00] P:1540.90 E:0.059020 |  So it's keeper against keeper here.
[9744.00 - 9747.00] P:1630.63 E:0.068493 |  Manuel Neuer at 2-1 in the penalty shootout.
[9747.00 - 9749.00] P:1642.41 E:0.060298 |  Neuer is going to take this third penalty.
[9749.00 - 9751.00] P:1650.50 E:0.063672 |  And this is a massive moment here.
[9751.00 - 9754.00] P:1694.80 E:0.065343 |  Neuer is going to run at it and thump it.
[9754.00 - 9756.00] P:1786.45 E:0.069922 |  It looks like he's going to just give it absolutely everything.
[9756.00 - 9758.00] P:1907.76 E:0.052157 |  Check crutches.
[9758.00 - 9762.00] P:1393.38 E:0.072426 |  And Neuer tucks it away in the other corner this time.
[9762.00 - 9764.00] P:1297.46 E:0.073180 |  So not only can he save them,
[9764.00 - 9767.00] P:1316.64 E:0.070332 |  he can also score them and it's 3-1 on pens.
[9767.00 - 9769.00] P:1652.01 E:0.063741 |  I think it makes a lot of sense, Mike,
[9769.00 - 9771.00] P:1556.10 E:0.067079 |  because if you think about a goalkeeper,
[9771.00 - 9773.00] P:1612.15 E:0.067136 |  he's forever taking dead ball kicks, always.
[9773.00 - 9775.00] P:1608.20 E:0.053642 |  It's a good penalty.
[9776.00 - 9781.00] P:1710.97 E:0.058956 |  It's not over yet, but really, Lampard has to score.
[9783.00 - 9785.00] P:1854.08 E:0.070380 |  Chelsea have lost both penalty shootouts
[9785.00 - 9788.00] P:1874.60 E:0.062491 |  that they faced in European competition.
[9788.00 - 9793.00] P:1881.54 E:0.058214 |  Bayern Munich have won all four that they faced.
[9793.00 - 9796.00] P:1878.47 E:0.056176 |  Neuer having scored.
[9796.00 - 9798.00] P:1872.55 E:0.063461 |  Neuer faces the Chelsea captain.
[9798.00 - 9802.00] P:1830.85 E:0.065653 |  Lampard normally so secure to 10-yard run-up.
[9802.00 - 9804.00] P:1754.47 E:0.064929 |  He's going to hit it right-footed.
[9804.00 - 9806.00] P:1474.78 E:0.074846 |  Brilliant.
[9806.00 - 9809.00] P:1627.36 E:0.062477 |  Last the ball into the roof of the net and it's back to 3-2.
[9809.00 - 9811.00] P:1627.96 E:0.054813 |  It's passed an eye before he even moved.
[9811.00 - 9813.00] P:1602.61 E:0.051861 |  No chance. Well done, the captain.
[9815.00 - 9820.00] P:1447.04 E:0.062275 |  Chelsea fans away at the other end of the ground,
[9820.00 - 9824.00] P:1483.79 E:0.063305 |  hoping, unhoping for a missed penalty from Bayern Munich.
[9824.00 - 9826.00] P:1562.34 E:0.070075 |  It's going to be one of their substitutes,
[9826.00 - 9830.00] P:1461.91 E:0.056924 |  Olic the Croatian, who's going to stride forward now
[9830.00 - 9834.00] P:1490.90 E:0.062208 |  and try and put Bayern into a 4-2 lead,
[9834.00 - 9837.00] P:1649.41 E:0.067758 |  which will be very hard for Chelsea to claw back.
[9837.00 - 9840.00] P:1778.42 E:0.057184 |  Olic from 5 yards.
[9841.00 - 9843.00] P:1614.48 E:0.055708 |  Czech waits.
[9843.00 - 9845.00] P:1655.85 E:0.076677 |  Olic, Czech saves!
[9845.00 - 9848.00] P:1413.85 E:0.077287 |  Turns it away before he took the penalty.
[9848.00 - 9851.00] P:1387.73 E:0.074140 |  Mark Larnsomer's shaking his head.
[9851.00 - 9854.00] P:1292.78 E:0.077527 |  I think there was something about Olic's body language.
[9854.00 - 9855.00] P:1443.65 E:0.068591 |  It was, mate.
[9855.00 - 9857.00] P:1183.89 E:0.068301 |  But Mark didn't fancy.
[9857.00 - 9859.00] P:1286.59 E:0.067480 |  And can Chelsea take advantage?
[9859.00 - 9861.00] P:1579.87 E:0.065443 |  He just had that little look where she just thought,
[9861.00 - 9863.00] P:1266.48 E:0.068528 |  he's not convinced about this at all.
[9863.00 - 9865.00] P:1442.44 E:0.057410 |  Good save, Czech.
[9865.00 - 9868.00] P:1532.89 E:0.068202 |  The responsibility now is with Ashley Cole.
[9868.00 - 9873.00] P:1730.77 E:0.058424 |  Ashley Cole, who appeared in a losing Champions League final
[9873.00 - 9877.00] P:1785.82 E:0.064096 |  for Arsenal, and then a losing Champions League final for Chelsea
[9877.00 - 9879.00] P:1788.44 E:0.057697 |  four years ago.
[9879.00 - 9884.00] P:1834.68 E:0.061305 |  This, to draw the penalty shootout, level at 3-3.
[9885.00 - 9890.00] P:1837.00 E:0.065923 |  Neuer again, implores the Bayern fans behind him to help.
[9890.00 - 9893.00] P:1878.40 E:0.063488 |  Just concentrate, Ashley.
[9893.00 - 9896.00] P:1695.99 E:0.073902 |  Left-footed, all excellent.
[9896.00 - 9898.00] P:1339.02 E:0.074927 |  Moan into the corner.
[9898.00 - 9901.00] P:1430.11 E:0.071816 |  Neuer went the right way, but he couldn't get anywhere near it,
[9901.00 - 9903.00] P:1497.52 E:0.069086 |  and it's 3-3.
[9903.00 - 9905.00] P:1607.06 E:0.061078 |  Well, that's just been his night, Ashley Cole.
[9905.00 - 9907.00] P:1437.21 E:0.066639 |  He's been absolutely brilliant for me.
[9907.00 - 9911.00] P:1418.00 E:0.075768 |  Absolutely sensational penalty by Ashley Cole.
[9911.00 - 9914.00] P:1493.53 E:0.066887 |  But now, probably the coolest player in the Bayern Munich team,
[9914.00 - 9916.00] P:1713.38 E:0.063016 |  Bastian Schweinsteiger.
[9916.00 - 9919.00] P:1639.30 E:0.069389 |  It was his penalty which brought Bayern Munich to this stage
[9919.00 - 9922.00] P:1712.31 E:0.071962 |  against Real Madrid in the semi-final.
[9922.00 - 9925.00] P:1773.53 E:0.065235 |  But he has to score this, because, of course,
[9925.00 - 9928.00] P:1772.41 E:0.063580 |  if Schweinsteiger doesn't put this one in the back of the net,
[9928.00 - 9932.00] P:1758.06 E:0.065063 |  then Chelsea could go on to win the Champions League.
[9932.00 - 9936.00] P:1807.51 E:0.059838 |  Schweinsteiger is calm.
[9936.00 - 9939.00] P:1774.50 E:0.060532 |  The Bayern fans expect.
[9939.00 - 9942.00] P:1624.52 E:0.067753 |  And Schweinsteiger hits the post!
[9942.00 - 9944.00] P:1428.19 E:0.075116 |  Schweinsteiger hits the post!
[9944.00 - 9949.00] P:1312.37 E:0.073996 |  And Chelsea are a penalty away from winning the Champions League.
[9949.00 - 9952.00] P:1447.81 E:0.071960 |  Yeah, did Czech actually get a little hand on it?
[9952.00 - 9954.00] P:1505.96 E:0.072481 |  I'm not sure, but it doesn't make it...
[9954.00 - 9956.00] P:1405.90 E:0.066977 |  It doesn't give a damn, because he's missed.
[9956.00 - 9959.00] P:1552.69 E:0.072690 |  He had a stutter up as well, he wasn't quite sure, was he?
[9961.00 - 9963.00] P:1308.85 E:0.063960 |  Giddy-ay, Drogba.
[9963.00 - 9965.00] P:1385.93 E:0.073358 |  Mamey goes back four years,
[9965.00 - 9968.00] P:1277.17 E:0.059500 |  sitting with Mamey in Moscow,
[9968.00 - 9971.00] P:1452.09 E:0.068737 |  watching Drogba being red-carded next to time,
[9971.00 - 9974.00] P:1411.27 E:0.071090 |  so he didn't take the penalty and the shootout.
[9974.00 - 9978.00] P:1488.70 E:0.064885 |  That's why Terry had to take a penalty, and Terry missed.
[9978.00 - 9981.00] P:1473.86 E:0.065663 |  Drogba now, having headed the equaliser,
[9981.00 - 9984.00] P:1448.47 E:0.071642 |  close to the end of the normal 90 minutes,
[9984.00 - 9989.00] P:1641.73 E:0.056843 |  can score, can win the Champions League
[9989.00 - 9994.00] P:1629.38 E:0.059832 |  on what will surely be his last performance for Chelsea.
[9994.00 - 9997.00] P:1585.48 E:0.055260 |  It's just a couple of yards of run-up.
[9997.00 - 9999.00] P:1662.43 E:0.059861 |  Noy are bouncing on his line.
[9999.00 - 10001.00] P:1705.81 E:0.048750 |  Drogba to win it.
[10001.00 - 10002.00] P:1892.72 E:0.069989 |  Come on, Giddy-ay!
[10002.00 - 10004.00] P:1730.77 E:0.073751 |  And he's won it!
[10004.00 - 10005.00] P:1719.59 E:0.071557 |  He's won it!
[10005.00 - 10008.00] P:1599.59 E:0.076531 |  Chelsea are champions of Europe, and Drogba,
[10008.00 - 10012.00] P:1442.94 E:0.074438 |  always the big man for the biggest occasion,
[10012.00 - 10015.00] P:1376.18 E:0.073919 |  has sealed a fantastic victory.
[10015.00 - 10018.00] P:1358.61 E:0.076131 |  No, Drogba, with his dream, has been fulfilled.
[10018.00 - 10021.00] P:1413.19 E:0.071518 |  Chelsea are champions of Europe.
[10023.00 - 10026.00] P:1731.83 E:0.078771 |  Absolutely astonishing scenes here,
[10026.00 - 10028.00] P:1627.74 E:0.073764 |  in the Allianz Arena.
[10028.00 - 10030.00] P:1725.71 E:0.075226 |  Schweinsteiger has pulled a shirt over his head.
[10030.00 - 10033.00] P:1632.87 E:0.075443 |  Ashley Cole is on his own.
[10033.00 - 10035.00] P:1533.56 E:0.074305 |  I would have thought, absolutely, in tears.
[10035.00 - 10038.00] P:1572.75 E:0.072547 |  There are a few Chelsea fans on the pitch.
[10038.00 - 10041.00] P:1531.66 E:0.075455 |  The Chelsea players won't know that the moment
[10041.00 - 10043.00] P:1582.87 E:0.076166 |  the engraver is doing his work.
[10043.00 - 10046.00] P:1609.49 E:0.072184 |  Roberto Di Matteo extremely dignified
[10046.00 - 10048.00] P:1542.08 E:0.071680 |  Shakespeare's hands with Jupp Heinkiss.
[10048.00 - 10051.00] P:1473.07 E:0.067493 |  And Chelsea have done it!
[10051.00 - 10054.00] P:1514.03 E:0.073707 |  Chelsea have won the Champions League, finally,
[10054.00 - 10058.00] P:1542.53 E:0.075281 |  and Roman Abramovich's dream has come true.
[10058.00 - 10061.00] P:1377.91 E:0.073114 |  Well, we've said it for 24 hours,
[10061.00 - 10064.00] P:1421.16 E:0.077635 |  and is it written in the stars that Leedsvards can go and win it?
[10064.00 - 10066.00] P:1429.96 E:0.073284 |  To show the courage that they have,
[10066.00 - 10069.00] P:1458.66 E:0.071256 |  let's be fair, buying in over 90 minutes with a better team.
[10069.00 - 10072.00] P:1460.01 E:0.070618 |  To show the courage that they have, to come back,
[10072.00 - 10075.00] P:1371.12 E:0.071408 |  to beat them on penalties after missing the first one,
[10075.00 - 10077.00] P:1441.67 E:0.069986 |  is quite a remarkable achievement.
[10077.00 - 10080.00] P:1430.90 E:0.075330 |  Well done, Chelsea, and well done everybody concerned
[10080.00 - 10081.00] P:1422.32 E:0.066212 |  for a fabulous night.
[10081.00 - 10085.00] P:1589.08 E:0.073108 |  Mark Lawrensen, you won a European Cup on penalties in 1984.
[10085.00 - 10088.00] P:1534.76 E:0.073146 |  Chelsea weren't the better team against Barcelona nor tonight,
[10088.00 - 10090.00] P:1649.49 E:0.062747 |  but that doesn't matter.
[10090.00 - 10093.00] P:1597.98 E:0.071036 |  They hung in there, and in Didier Drogba,
[10093.00 - 10096.00] P:1578.35 E:0.071084 |  nine goals in nine finals, and now a winning penalty
[10096.00 - 10099.00] P:1458.88 E:0.073196 |  with quite possibly his last ever kick as a Chelsea player.
[10099.00 - 10102.00] P:1503.90 E:0.070625 |  And people say that stories aren't written.
[10102.00 - 10104.00] P:1353.23 E:0.061927 |  Well, you know, as I said to you,
[10104.00 - 10106.00] P:1459.70 E:0.073115 |  we spoke a couple of times over the weekend,
[10106.00 - 10108.00] P:1359.19 E:0.072539 |  previewing the game, Mark.
[10108.00 - 10110.00] P:1328.76 E:0.070467 |  Sometimes there's a football,
[10110.00 - 10113.00] P:1415.56 E:0.067954 |  I think things happen in football matches and on pitches,
[10113.00 - 10115.00] P:1535.05 E:0.068880 |  and especially in Cup competitions,
[10115.00 - 10118.00] P:1502.12 E:0.072128 |  and it absolutely totally convinces you that you're going to win.
[10118.00 - 10119.00] P:1549.79 E:0.082123 |  Look at Drogba, Mark.
[10119.00 - 10123.00] P:1742.28 E:0.071306 |  Over in the corner, he's taken his shirt off, he's thrown it down.
[10123.00 - 10126.00] P:1549.76 E:0.069414 |  He is king of this place.
[10126.00 - 10128.00] P:1447.69 E:0.067629 |  Well, I've said it just 20 minutes ago,
[10128.00 - 10130.00] P:1466.55 E:0.075492 |  when he's got the equaliser,
[10130.00 - 10132.00] P:1363.59 E:0.073403 |  he's been the best centre forward of his type,
[10132.00 - 10136.00] P:1411.90 E:0.072244 |  and certainly in the Premier League for the past eight years.
[10136.00 - 10139.00] P:1465.11 E:0.075767 |  It could be his last appearance for what we're hearing.
[10139.00 - 10141.00] P:1648.80 E:0.071116 |  I sincerely hope it is not,
[10141.00 - 10143.00] P:1749.74 E:0.071558 |  because he's still got something to offer,
[10143.00 - 10146.00] P:1603.40 E:0.074711 |  as we've just seen, big player, big occasion,
[10146.00 - 10148.00] P:1599.57 E:0.074964 |  quite remarkable that he's gone and got the two goals.
[10148.00 - 10151.00] P:1828.70 E:0.075265 |  How many times over the years have we seen English players
[10151.00 - 10155.00] P:1765.86 E:0.071591 |  on the ground, inconsolable, crying,
[10155.00 - 10157.00] P:1759.93 E:0.064526 |  shirts over their heads,
[10157.00 - 10159.00] P:1877.44 E:0.071142 |  while German teams on the whole celebrate?
[10159.00 - 10162.00] P:1838.77 E:0.069324 |  And look at Iron Robin, his pain, his edge,
[10162.00 - 10164.00] P:1770.05 E:0.071101 |  he is saying to himself in Dutch,
[10164.00 - 10165.00] P:1731.99 E:0.066934 |  how has this happened?
[10165.00 - 10167.00] P:1746.53 E:0.068740 |  I've missed a penalty, and we've lost on penalties.
[10167.00 - 10170.00] P:1773.91 E:0.069324 |  And Frank Lampard, sorry Steve, who's set off to the Cup Final,
[10170.00 - 10173.00] P:1850.60 E:0.072793 |  D-Day Drogba is my hero, he's helped me win so many trophies.
[10173.00 - 10176.00] P:1658.22 E:0.068931 |  Now he's helped me win the trophy with the big ears.
[10176.00 - 10178.00] P:1598.53 E:0.056896 |  Well, I mean, fantastic, it's just in comparison
[10178.00 - 10180.00] P:1688.76 E:0.068884 |  that we've seen John Terry stripped too.
[10180.00 - 10181.00] P:1627.61 E:0.073946 |  Yeah, yeah, I was going to say that.
[10181.00 - 10183.00] P:1459.00 E:0.063022 |  Is he going to go and lift it?
[10183.00 - 10185.00] P:1473.37 E:0.053168 |  Certainly looks like it.
[10185.00 - 10190.00] P:1665.27 E:0.070592 |  Absolutely astonishing how football continues to astound.
[10190.00 - 10193.00] P:1500.84 E:0.071836 |  And Schreinsteiger, of course, who is a Munich boy,
[10193.00 - 10196.00] P:1431.11 E:0.069779 |  Mark, he's so proud to play for this club,
[10196.00 - 10199.00] P:1526.47 E:0.069799 |  and it was that penalty, just a little hitch step, wasn't it?
[10199.00 - 10202.00] P:1614.58 E:0.072710 |  There was a little John Aldridge hitch step in there, wasn't there?
[10202.00 - 10206.00] P:1371.10 E:0.069530 |  Yeah, and in all honesty, I mean, it wasn't the worst of penalties,
[10206.00 - 10208.00] P:1613.00 E:0.073257 |  but he's missed, he's missed.
[10208.00 - 10210.00] P:1632.37 E:0.076963 |  And one or two probably worse,
[10210.00 - 10213.00] P:1733.61 E:0.067424 |  actually scored just a shot there of Roman Abramovich,
[10213.00 - 10215.00] P:1688.93 E:0.071501 |  who spent hundreds of millions,
[10215.00 - 10218.00] P:1743.11 E:0.069266 |  and he's finally got what he really wanted all that time.
[10218.00 - 10221.00] P:1730.46 E:0.069941 |  And Mark, it's the FA Cup's league championship,
[10221.00 - 10223.00] P:1668.68 E:0.068678 |  absolutely everything.
[10223.00 - 10224.00] P:1746.42 E:0.070505 |  Let's not forget as well,
[10224.00 - 10227.00] P:1535.99 E:0.065283 |  Tottenham will miss out on the Champions League.
[10227.00 - 10229.00] P:1795.92 E:0.069893 |  It's a crushing blow for Tottenham,
[10229.00 - 10231.00] P:1726.24 E:0.072213 |  and for Harry Redknapp, who were two minutes away
[10231.00 - 10233.00] P:1825.09 E:0.067192 |  from the Champions League,
[10233.00 - 10236.00] P:1869.75 E:0.070239 |  and at 3-2 up, going with serve as it were, really,
[10236.00 - 10238.00] P:2075.86 E:0.071572 |  and the penalty shootout as well, Steve.
[10238.00 - 10241.00] P:1846.66 E:0.059851 |  When Olig stood up, they were leading 3-2,
[10241.00 - 10244.00] P:1755.03 E:0.065869 |  and if Olig had scored, that would have put enormous pressure
[10244.00 - 10246.00] P:1786.43 E:0.060026 |  on Ashley Cole to score.
[10246.00 - 10250.00] P:1718.67 E:0.069277 |  We have seen a German team lose in Germany a penalty shootout.
[10250.00 - 10252.00] P:1504.35 E:0.068191 |  Well, it doesn't happen very often,
[10252.00 - 10254.00] P:1634.20 E:0.059508 |  and you can see Schweinsteiger,
[10254.00 - 10256.00] P:1654.75 E:0.065804 |  the cameras are beaming in on him.
[10256.00 - 10258.00] P:1608.56 E:0.061094 |  That kid is absolutely distraught,
[10258.00 - 10260.00] P:1689.84 E:0.069521 |  and it'll stay with him. How long will that stay with him?
[10260.00 - 10263.00] P:1729.48 E:0.065235 |  You know, all summer, you have to live with that.
[10263.00 - 10266.00] P:1921.01 E:0.067649 |  Ashley Cole, sorry, Ashley Cole is prodding Roberto Di Matteo
[10266.00 - 10269.00] P:1925.43 E:0.066249 |  in the chest, as if to say, you have done a lot of this.
[10269.00 - 10271.00] P:1890.35 E:0.070975 |  You have done a lot of this, what a turnaround.
[10271.00 - 10274.00] P:1666.00 E:0.060884 |  Yeah, have to give the credit to Demetrio.
[10274.00 - 10277.00] P:1878.23 E:0.067386 |  Ivanovic is on the crossfire, like the Scots in 1975,
[10277.00 - 10280.00] P:1742.81 E:0.066518 |  but Wembley had drugged her very sportingly,
[10280.00 - 10282.00] P:1787.86 E:0.060974 |  because of course he played with Robin for two seasons,
[10282.00 - 10285.00] P:1751.38 E:0.066494 |  goes over to Iron Robin and gives him an enormous hug,
[10285.00 - 10288.00] P:1751.48 E:0.067201 |  and I don't think Robin is too proud to have a good old cry
[10288.00 - 10290.00] P:1766.44 E:0.057345 |  on his former teammate's shoulders.
[10290.00 - 10293.00] P:1672.40 E:0.062962 |  Well, listen, it does make Gromben cry.
[10293.00 - 10295.00] P:1601.04 E:0.070535 |  They get paid handsome sums of money and all the rest of it,
[10295.00 - 10297.00] P:1698.25 E:0.057621 |  but it hurts them, believe me.
[10297.00 - 10300.00] P:1779.84 E:0.064803 |  You see Ivanovic on the crossfire now.
[10300.00 - 10303.00] P:1808.56 E:0.065556 |  I hope he doesn't sell himself an injury by getting up there.
[10303.00 - 10306.00] P:1724.00 E:0.065234 |  Chelsea have won this competition away from home.
[10306.00 - 10309.00] P:1696.99 E:0.064560 |  Absolutely, totally away from home,
[10309.00 - 10313.00] P:1662.09 E:0.062819 |  and in many, many ways, you know, the performances in Lisbon,
[10313.00 - 10317.00] P:1543.65 E:0.066541 |  and obviously at Camp Nou, Barcelona have really set them up
[10317.00 - 10319.00] P:1658.74 E:0.053809 |  for this night, but I mean,
[10319.00 - 10322.00] P:1616.47 E:0.066619 |  DDA's drug was equalised in the time that it was,
[10322.00 - 10324.00] P:1722.06 E:0.059320 |  just has made such a massive difference
[10324.00 - 10326.00] P:1521.98 E:0.061774 |  to the outcome of this game.
[10326.00 - 10328.00] P:1769.10 E:0.066116 |  John Terry is in his Chelsea kit.
[10328.00 - 10331.00] P:1816.22 E:0.065837 |  He is in his Chelsea kit, Alan, I think he's ready in his Chelsea kit
[10331.00 - 10335.00] P:1667.73 E:0.064522 |  as if he's played the game to go and pick up the European Cup.
[10335.00 - 10337.00] P:1723.21 E:0.058467 |  He has won the lot.
[10337.00 - 10342.00] P:1703.37 E:0.059304 |  John Terry, DDA Droga, Petticec, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard,
[10342.00 - 10344.00] P:1632.94 E:0.067164 |  they've won everything like you did, Mark,
[10344.00 - 10346.00] P:1480.49 E:0.067920 |  that they possibly could win.
[10346.00 - 10348.00] P:1646.13 E:0.063373 |  And when you're old and grey and sit in your rocking chair,
[10348.00 - 10351.00] P:1527.33 E:0.058366 |  you look back and you go, that's a pretty good return on a career.
[10351.00 - 10353.00] P:1614.81 E:0.062004 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[10353.00 - 10355.00] P:1486.24 E:0.070275 |  You know the thing about it, Mark, once you win one,
[10355.00 - 10357.00] P:1451.71 E:0.061439 |  and Steve knows this as well as I do,
[10357.00 - 10360.00] P:1541.69 E:0.059929 |  you think the first one out of suite is that one.
[10360.00 - 10364.00] P:1539.86 E:0.058136 |  You just want to keep winning and winning and winning.
[10364.00 - 10366.00] P:1665.53 E:0.061553 |  Well, Chelsea's name has been engraved.
[10366.00 - 10368.00] P:1760.50 E:0.069119 |  It is there. They cannot remove it.
[10368.00 - 10370.00] P:1551.94 E:0.058168 |  This really did happen.
[10370.00 - 10372.00] P:1411.38 E:0.065647 |  It's quite remarkable, I mean, how quiet.
[10372.00 - 10375.00] P:1550.41 E:0.061691 |  I have to say, they're played to the buying fans
[10375.00 - 10377.00] P:1580.92 E:0.063820 |  and the vast majority of them stayed in the stadium.
[10377.00 - 10380.00] P:1522.23 E:0.062598 |  That doesn't happen very often, but it's quite a remarkable night.
[10380.00 - 10382.00] P:1715.51 E:0.064820 |  And as I've said, as I've said,
[10382.00 - 10384.00] P:1751.06 E:0.062666 |  Droga, Petticec, Terry Lampard,
[10384.00 - 10387.00] P:1726.35 E:0.059224 |  they've been fantastic servants and fantastic players for Chelsea
[10387.00 - 10390.00] P:1781.10 E:0.063090 |  over the years as Droga takes a bow.
[10390.00 - 10392.00] P:1883.28 E:0.072423 |  You know when you go to the theatre and you think,
[10392.00 - 10395.00] P:1826.40 E:0.067529 |  oh, he's a terrific actress and I like watching her,
[10395.00 - 10397.00] P:1740.66 E:0.067352 |  and at the end they do their curtain call,
[10397.00 - 10399.00] P:1614.49 E:0.063480 |  but then the main man comes out, doesn't he?
[10399.00 - 10401.00] P:1712.23 E:0.065708 |  All women and everybody starts up.
[10401.00 - 10403.00] P:1730.78 E:0.067209 |  Droga has just done that.
[10403.00 - 10405.00] P:1614.08 E:0.066679 |  Well, I have to say, if they're going to replace him,
[10405.00 - 10407.00] P:1653.98 E:0.060597 |  how do you replace him?
[10407.00 - 10409.00] P:1622.54 E:0.067654 |  Because he has been quite fantastic year in and year out.
[10409.00 - 10412.00] P:1631.80 E:0.062176 |  It's quite fitting that he's got an equalising goal
[10412.00 - 10415.00] P:1502.76 E:0.065050 |  and quite fitting that he's got the penalty if he is going to bow out.
[10415.00 - 10418.00] P:1619.60 E:0.061791 |  Still the fine players, a lot of them.
[10418.00 - 10420.00] P:1871.20 E:0.066057 |  Iron Roberts now on his haunches completely on his own
[10420.00 - 10423.00] P:1790.44 E:0.066876 |  and Schweinsteiger still in the centre circle,
[10423.00 - 10425.00] P:1640.21 E:0.061518 |  head bowed, hand on head.
[10425.00 - 10428.00] P:1712.35 E:0.068537 |  Jupp Heinkers is all on his own on the halfway line.
[10428.00 - 10431.00] P:1610.41 E:0.070935 |  Two minutes away from winning the European Cup in his own ground
[10431.00 - 10435.00] P:1568.92 E:0.068273 |  and now denied by Didier Droga
[10435.00 - 10437.00] P:1614.70 E:0.068549 |  and denying Tottenham as well.
[10437.00 - 10439.00] P:1695.18 E:0.070655 |  An arsell into the qualifiers,
[10439.00 - 10441.00] P:1564.02 E:0.072317 |  and you can get a pretty nasty qualifier as well there,
[10441.00 - 10443.00] P:1612.53 E:0.071232 |  and it slightly disturbs the beginning of the season.
[10443.00 - 10446.00] P:1508.12 E:0.068786 |  Peter Cech getting a hug, of course, from Didier Droga,
[10446.00 - 10448.00] P:1582.08 E:0.069933 |  because Cech saved all his chances.
[10448.00 - 10450.00] P:1601.10 E:0.071236 |  And I think you're right, Mark,
[10450.00 - 10452.00] P:1712.79 E:0.068326 |  you might have just got a little feather on Schweinsteiger's,
[10452.00 - 10455.00] P:1465.01 E:0.069306 |  maybe just a little feather to put it onto the post.
[10455.00 - 10457.00] P:1415.98 E:0.072801 |  Yeah, quite possibly.
[10457.00 - 10459.00] P:1515.00 E:0.075106 |  Interesting to see you didn't take a penalty,
[10459.00 - 10462.00] P:1601.28 E:0.059106 |  did you, unlike Neuer for Bayern Munich.
[10462.00 - 10466.00] P:1362.89 E:0.064667 |  This is just one of the absolutely brilliant times of football in your life
[10466.00 - 10469.00] P:1354.70 E:0.066494 |  when you know you're going to go up and collect that trophy.
[10469.00 - 10471.00] P:1540.12 E:0.065230 |  The big ears trophy, as it's called, is brilliant.
[10471.00 - 10473.00] P:1545.49 E:0.066344 |  What is quite remarkable as well,
[10473.00 - 10475.00] P:1644.29 E:0.063287 |  the two penalties, big crucial penalties,
[10475.00 - 10478.00] P:1519.03 E:0.062385 |  Ashley Coles and David Luiz, two defenders.
[10478.00 - 10480.00] P:1413.93 E:0.065332 |  Who two defenders, and you think, oh,
[10480.00 - 10483.00] P:1465.16 E:0.069696 |  we both all turned away when David Luiz had it and thought,
[10483.00 - 10486.00] P:1445.89 E:0.062350 |  oh, centre-back taking a big important penalty.
[10486.00 - 10488.00] P:1646.17 E:0.057478 |  Quite remarkably smashed it in the top four.
[10488.00 - 10490.00] P:1943.63 E:0.068001 |  And Didier Droga is the story tonight,
[10490.00 - 10492.00] P:1824.32 E:0.070811 |  but Didier Droga gave away a penalty in the Camp Nou,
[10492.00 - 10495.00] P:1763.49 E:0.062215 |  which a messy miss, and Droga gives away a penalty here,
[10495.00 - 10496.00] P:1710.63 E:0.056540 |  which Robin misses.
[10496.00 - 10499.00] P:1713.14 E:0.065260 |  Both those penalties could have easily knocked Chelsea out.
[10499.00 - 10501.00] P:1663.12 E:0.063874 |  How many more layers are there to this story?
[10501.00 - 10503.00] P:1754.36 E:0.063250 |  And that's why some people will say...
[10503.00 - 10506.00] P:1647.04 E:0.061518 |  They say you have to have a little bit of luck to win the game.
[10506.00 - 10508.00] P:1556.92 E:0.062938 |  And that's that little bit of luck.
[10508.00 - 10511.00] P:1547.70 E:0.062371 |  Robin, a terrific penalty taker, is missed,
[10511.00 - 10514.00] P:1513.20 E:0.063424 |  and he put him off taking one in the shootout.
[10514.00 - 10517.00] P:1588.25 E:0.057762 |  And of course, the best player in the world,
[10517.00 - 10519.00] P:1695.46 E:0.070410 |  messy miss one a few weeks ago,
[10519.00 - 10521.00] P:1580.39 E:0.052955 |  which has sent them through to this final.
[10521.00 - 10524.00] P:1756.99 E:0.063902 |  And Mark, they have had some bad luck in the Champions League, Chelsea.
[10524.00 - 10527.00] P:1786.42 E:0.066402 |  Clearly, you know, John Ceri slipping, although people would argue
[10527.00 - 10529.00] P:1764.68 E:0.064334 |  his technique wasn't really quite up to it.
[10529.00 - 10531.00] P:1777.97 E:0.063561 |  But clearly, the semi-final against Barcelona
[10531.00 - 10533.00] P:1639.18 E:0.067389 |  with a Norwegian referee.
[10533.00 - 10535.00] P:1700.68 E:0.064487 |  You'd have to have a harder stone, not to...
[10535.00 - 10538.00] P:1668.31 E:0.069324 |  You would have to, to begrudge them a little bit of a night.
[10538.00 - 10541.00] P:1629.50 E:0.059470 |  Absolutely. Well, they could have had four penalties at night.
[10541.00 - 10543.00] P:1476.59 E:0.072393 |  And they weren't borderline incidents either, were they?
[10543.00 - 10545.00] P:1385.08 E:0.063405 |  They were absolutely stone-cold penalties.
[10545.00 - 10548.00] P:1350.50 E:0.064883 |  So they say that, you know, it does eventually run for you to look.
[10548.00 - 10550.00] P:1341.41 E:0.062841 |  It's been with them in this competition,
[10550.00 - 10552.00] P:1468.71 E:0.061626 |  but what an absolutely fantastic effort.
[10552.00 - 10554.00] P:1561.68 E:0.055352 |  Not just tonight, but, you know,
[10554.00 - 10556.00] P:1584.69 E:0.063433 |  the second leg game against Napoli, Mark,
[10556.00 - 10558.00] P:1201.60 E:0.059731 |  but, you know, and you talked about actually cold clearance
[10558.00 - 10560.00] P:1552.08 E:0.063812 |  after line could have been 4-1, et cetera.
[10560.00 - 10564.00] P:1476.23 E:0.065611 |  Just when they've needed something fortuitous to happen to them,
[10564.00 - 10567.00] P:1425.00 E:0.061002 |  they've had it, and good luck to them, they've earned it.
[10567.00 - 10569.00] P:1795.87 E:0.060930 |  So what we have is a phalanx of photographers
[10569.00 - 10571.00] P:1975.42 E:0.066427 |  across the halfway line behind a rope,
[10571.00 - 10573.00] P:1902.67 E:0.064772 |  and the Chelsea players are lined up like a rugby team,
[10573.00 - 10575.00] P:1844.56 E:0.058442 |  sort of, you know, ten each side,
[10575.00 - 10577.00] P:1728.12 E:0.063504 |  almost as if they're going to clap by Munich down there,
[10577.00 - 10580.00] P:1599.06 E:0.064226 |  which they won't, instead the singers dancing down there.
[10580.00 - 10583.00] P:1562.30 E:0.066204 |  The referee is now going through the tunnel.
[10583.00 - 10585.00] P:1593.15 E:0.064559 |  Fair do's the referee had a probably decent game, didn't he?
[10585.00 - 10588.00] P:1721.16 E:0.073970 |  They're covering the referee off the eighth, he did very, very well.
[10588.00 - 10590.00] P:1859.70 E:0.068014 |  I'm not sure he did that well, but...
[10590.00 - 10595.00] P:1892.71 E:0.066226 |  And the referee and the assistants are going up to get their medals,
[10595.00 - 10597.00] P:1815.46 E:0.069786 |  and it's going to be a moment for John Terry
[10597.00 - 10599.00] P:1992.79 E:0.056065 |  and for Chelsea quite soon,
[10599.00 - 10601.00] P:1778.97 E:0.059789 |  and for Roman Abramovich to remember forever,
[10601.00 - 10603.00] P:1890.26 E:0.068117 |  and then you'll want to call Alan,
[10603.00 - 10609.00] P:1755.32 E:0.061189 |  because the lines are open for 606, 0500, 909, 693, 850, 580 on the text.
[10609.00 - 10611.00] P:1610.60 E:0.056931 |  Might be a West Ham fan as well,
[10611.00 - 10613.00] P:1689.56 E:0.058923 |  you want to talk about that,
[10613.00 - 10616.00] P:1530.04 E:0.059744 |  because West Ham, of course, backs in the Premier League.
[10616.00 - 10618.00] P:1649.12 E:0.067510 |  And just the final thing before we hand over to Alan Mark,
[10618.00 - 10621.00] P:1668.25 E:0.064877 |  to win on penalties, which you did in Roma as well.
[10621.00 - 10625.00] P:1654.92 E:0.063875 |  It does add that extra piquancy, that layer of contention and excitement.
[10625.00 - 10627.00] P:1609.70 E:0.066165 |  Yeah, it's absolutely horrible at the time, Mark,
[10627.00 - 10629.00] P:1694.81 E:0.059731 |  and, you know, it is a cure for constipation,
[10629.00 - 10631.00] P:1540.89 E:0.068724 |  the only one that I know,
[10631.00 - 10634.00] P:1513.24 E:0.051173 |  but it's a fantastic feeling when you win.
[10634.00 - 10637.00] P:1775.36 E:0.063283 |  So the Chelsea players now are going to Usher,
[10637.00 - 10640.00] P:1627.18 E:0.054663 |  the Bayern Munich players, down that tunnel,
[10640.00 - 10642.00] P:1842.52 E:0.054905 |  and Philippe Larm, the captain,
[10642.00 - 10646.00] P:1731.63 E:0.057032 |  just accepts the handshakes from a couple of players,
[10646.00 - 10649.00] P:1908.02 E:0.069360 |  and very sportingly, they are applauded by Chelsea,
[10649.00 - 10650.00] P:1769.46 E:0.061996 |  and that's good to see.
[10650.00 - 10652.00] P:1902.74 E:0.066963 |  Nice touch, absolutely nice touch,
[10652.00 - 10654.00] P:1921.25 E:0.068568 |  because there's nothing worse than their runners-up
[10654.00 - 10655.00] P:1850.33 E:0.054535 |  in a big cup final.
[10655.00 - 10657.00] P:1769.21 E:0.068206 |  Fair play to Chelsea, you know,
[10657.00 - 10660.00] P:1881.96 E:0.063121 |  they've made a garden of honour for them, and it's a good touch.
[10660.00 - 10662.00] P:2075.06 E:0.075952 |  It's not the walk that Philippe Larm wanted,
[10662.00 - 10664.00] P:1967.65 E:0.071717 |  he wanted to pick up the European Cup
[10664.00 - 10666.00] P:1884.04 E:0.061746 |  in his own town, in his own stadium.
[10666.00 - 10668.00] P:1830.07 E:0.070298 |  Instead, it's going to be runners-up,
[10668.00 - 10670.00] P:1931.28 E:0.069585 |  and the moment's time is going to be a moment
[10670.00 - 10673.00] P:1902.19 E:0.060476 |  that Chelsea fans will remember for the rest of their lives.
[10673.00 - 10674.00] P:1666.41 E:0.040398 |  Here's Alan.
[10674.00 - 10677.00] P:1690.63 E:0.059017 |  And unfortunately for Bastion Spainsteiger,
[10677.00 - 10680.00] P:1555.23 E:0.057603 |  it's also a moment that he will never forget.
[10680.00 - 10682.00] P:1538.78 E:0.059789 |  He is the last Bayern player,
[10682.00 - 10686.00] P:1466.69 E:0.057995 |  the very last Bayern player to make his way
[10686.00 - 10690.00] P:1530.87 E:0.057969 |  towards that tribute of honour that Chelsea have formed.
[10690.00 - 10692.00] P:1312.76 E:0.061852 |  He's been applauded,
[10692.00 - 10695.00] P:1523.99 E:0.063759 |  but there's no disguising in his hurt,
[10695.00 - 10698.00] P:1349.35 E:0.066566 |  and all that of the other Bayern Munich players.
[10698.00 - 10702.00] P:1408.12 E:0.064958 |  Spainsteiger can barely hold back the tears.
[10702.00 - 10706.00] P:1165.71 E:0.064447 |  You don't want a loser's medal on a night like this.
[10706.00 - 10708.00] P:1402.56 E:0.072023 |  And they were only two minutes away
[10708.00 - 10710.00] P:1123.74 E:0.059257 |  from winners' medals Bayern Munich.
[10710.00 - 10713.00] P:1457.16 E:0.056314 |  And if it had ended in 90 minutes,
[10713.00 - 10716.00] P:1214.13 E:0.066966 |  if Bayern Munich had claimed their fifth European Cup
[10716.00 - 10720.00] P:1211.12 E:0.054181 |  Stoke Champions League, who could have complained, Mark?
[10720.00 - 10721.00] P:1399.23 E:0.065026 |  They were the better team.
[10721.00 - 10723.00] P:1406.71 E:0.065095 |  No, they were the better team, Alan.
[10723.00 - 10724.00] P:1447.83 E:0.046925 |  They were way from that fact.
[10724.00 - 10727.00] P:1469.93 E:0.058486 |  But you know, credit Chelsea, because they hung in there,
[10727.00 - 10729.00] P:1590.79 E:0.069171 |  and they hung in and fought, and they scrapped.
[10729.00 - 10732.00] P:1340.39 E:0.058769 |  And you know, Chelsea against Barcelona.
[10732.00 - 10735.00] P:1371.40 E:0.071720 |  But Barcelona were the better team easily over the two legs.
[10735.00 - 10737.00] P:1592.38 E:0.062956 |  But again, they just fought and they scrapped,
[10737.00 - 10741.00] P:1409.60 E:0.060787 |  and you have to give massive credit to Roberto de Matteo.
[10741.00 - 10743.00] P:1342.37 E:0.062804 |  Absolutely brilliant.
[10743.00 - 10744.00] P:1652.96 E:0.068811 |  The way he's managed them,
[10744.00 - 10746.00] P:1524.94 E:0.064431 |  because he's not sure what's going to happen to him tomorrow,
[10746.00 - 10748.00] P:1486.37 E:0.064398 |  let alone what was going to happen to the players
[10748.00 - 10750.00] P:1512.49 E:0.068143 |  and all he's done, that's not all he's done,
[10750.00 - 10752.00] P:1493.22 E:0.066977 |  but what he has done, he's got them all together.
[10752.00 - 10754.00] P:1449.53 E:0.067254 |  They've all been playing for each other.
[10754.00 - 10755.00] P:1427.63 E:0.069721 |  They've all raised the game.
[10755.00 - 10757.00] P:1401.13 E:0.059384 |  He's got the more experienced players back in the team.
[10757.00 - 10759.00] P:1443.64 E:0.062284 |  And boy, has that made a difference.
[10759.00 - 10762.00] P:1296.82 E:0.060869 |  Well, we don't know what's going to happen to de Matteo.
[10762.00 - 10767.00] P:1273.37 E:0.059815 |  Only Roman Abramovich knows what will happen to his caretaker manager.
[10767.00 - 10770.00] P:1389.19 E:0.063391 |  But you know, they've just won the FA Cup.
[10770.00 - 10772.00] P:1464.86 E:0.066447 |  They've just won the Champions League.
[10772.00 - 10775.00] P:1225.41 E:0.067514 |  Let's say it will be a very cruel blow
[10775.00 - 10780.00] P:1112.08 E:0.059651 |  if de Matteo doesn't be offered the job on a permanent basis.
[10780.00 - 10784.00] P:1257.50 E:0.065141 |  It may well be it will only last another year
[10784.00 - 10789.00] P:1430.18 E:0.066506 |  until a manager in the mind of Abramovich of greater stature is available.
[10789.00 - 10791.00] P:1447.50 E:0.057094 |  But we'll see.
[10791.00 - 10796.00] P:1465.36 E:0.062857 |  De Matteo is being encouraged to go forward
[10796.00 - 10799.00] P:1539.42 E:0.062414 |  before his players, Vichel Platini,
[10799.00 - 10803.00] P:1446.23 E:0.064344 |  the president of UEFA, is handing out the medals.
[10803.00 - 10806.00] P:1433.70 E:0.067531 |  It's been a long walk and a hard climb
[10806.00 - 10808.00] P:1438.56 E:0.064979 |  for those Bayern Munich players.
[10808.00 - 10810.00] P:1529.48 E:0.066334 |  Here in the Allianz Arena
[10810.00 - 10814.00] P:1444.72 E:0.061151 |  to receive the runners-up medals that they don't want.
[10814.00 - 10817.00] P:1388.83 E:0.061508 |  In the 120 minutes, I'm told,
[10817.00 - 10820.00] P:1164.63 E:0.061640 |  Bayern had 35 goal attempts.
[10820.00 - 10822.00] P:1297.01 E:0.061962 |  Chelsea, nine.
[10822.00 - 10825.00] P:1141.53 E:0.052612 |  But you know something that's probably similar
[10825.00 - 10828.00] P:1492.52 E:0.061580 |  against Barcelona in both legs of the semi-finals.
[10828.00 - 10829.00] P:1321.19 E:0.059059 |  There's probably more.
[10829.00 - 10832.00] P:1016.00 E:0.050279 |  The difference would have been more, I would have thought.
[10832.00 - 10835.00] P:1414.20 E:0.064037 |  Well, I've got to admit, you know, having been in Naples,
[10835.00 - 10839.00] P:1506.42 E:0.057346 |  I couldn't see how Chelsea could get back into that tie.
[10839.00 - 10841.00] P:1188.06 E:0.050770 |  But they did, remarkably.
[10841.00 - 10845.00] P:1425.82 E:0.058111 |  Alan, two-nil down, John Terry off in the Camp Nou.
[10845.00 - 10847.00] P:1266.47 E:0.062258 |  I didn't give them a chance.
[10847.00 - 10849.00] P:1531.88 E:0.073042 |  Either night against Barcelona.
[10849.00 - 10850.00] P:1240.98 E:0.038233 |  Either night.
[10850.00 - 10852.00] P:1331.46 E:0.059946 |  But this is what is wonderful about the game
[10852.00 - 10855.00] P:1460.49 E:0.072655 |  that supports us and that we know
[10855.00 - 10858.00] P:1493.26 E:0.066693 |  that these nights can happen.
[10858.00 - 10863.00] P:1535.99 E:0.064679 |  Congratulations, says the man in the Tanoi to Chelsea.
[10863.00 - 10867.00] P:1431.68 E:0.064954 |  Well, Roberto DiMitale has earned the right
[10867.00 - 10870.00] P:1634.76 E:0.061588 |  to lead his players up the steps.
[10870.00 - 10873.00] P:1654.27 E:0.058399 |  He looks quite modest, quite shy.
[10873.00 - 10876.00] P:1582.88 E:0.056746 |  He was great with your pancreas at the end of the game.
[10876.00 - 10878.00] P:1527.68 E:0.066869 |  Your great dignity.
[10878.00 - 10880.00] P:1543.16 E:0.062015 |  And I think you basically said, look, you know what?
[10880.00 - 10883.00] P:1669.48 E:0.056430 |  In penalties, anybody can win.
[10883.00 - 10887.00] P:1398.56 E:0.063240 |  You know, I'm thinking back to the Abramovich era
[10887.00 - 10890.00] P:1460.29 E:0.072259 |  and all the managers who tried but didn't deliver.
[10890.00 - 10892.00] P:1503.89 E:0.062524 |  There have been a few.
[10892.00 - 10899.00] P:1547.35 E:0.062796 |  Brañere, Mourinho, Grant, Scallari, Hiddick, Ancelotti,
[10899.00 - 10902.00] P:1334.94 E:0.065705 |  Villas-Fos, I might have missed out half a dozen.
[10902.00 - 10905.00] P:1568.22 E:0.068796 |  There have been so many managers in Abramovich's term
[10905.00 - 10907.00] P:1670.65 E:0.072353 |  in charge of Chelsea.
[10907.00 - 10910.00] P:1393.77 E:0.064727 |  But it's a caretaker manager who doesn't know
[10910.00 - 10914.00] P:1647.93 E:0.065921 |  if he will be in employment next weekend,
[10914.00 - 10916.00] P:1225.22 E:0.076385 |  getting a hug from a little girl
[10916.00 - 10920.00] P:1445.31 E:0.067699 |  and a hug from a man and a kiss as well from a man.
[10920.00 - 10925.00] P:1740.60 E:0.060025 |  And he leads the players further towards the podium.
[10925.00 - 10928.00] P:1687.50 E:0.071948 |  David Luis wearing an outrageous hat that matches
[10928.00 - 10930.00] P:1769.35 E:0.055985 |  outrageous hairstyle.
[10930.00 - 10932.00] P:1615.99 E:0.067843 |  What a brilliant penalty he took.
[10932.00 - 10934.00] P:1300.71 E:0.053150 |  What a penalty.
[10934.00 - 10936.00] P:1422.72 E:0.069577 |  And the photographer, he gathered on a podium.
[10936.00 - 10940.00] P:1449.36 E:0.055189 |  Well, there must be two or three hundred of them there.
[10940.00 - 10943.00] P:1499.47 E:0.072199 |  There's a huge smile on the face of DiMitale.
[10943.00 - 10945.00] P:1549.36 E:0.067938 |  And Abramovich kisses him.
[10945.00 - 10947.00] P:1492.46 E:0.062025 |  Maybe that's a sign.
[10947.00 - 10950.00] P:1449.91 E:0.063121 |  Maybe that's a sign for the Russian owner.
[10950.00 - 10954.00] P:1611.54 E:0.069097 |  He will never have envisaged a night as dramatic as this
[10954.00 - 10955.00] P:1706.29 E:0.068258 |  to climax his dream.
[10955.00 - 10960.00] P:1612.96 E:0.061448 |  I've never seen Abramovich so animated in my life.
[10960.00 - 10964.00] P:1476.63 E:0.062608 |  DiMitale walks along towards the trophy.
[10964.00 - 10966.00] P:1259.80 E:0.049190 |  He won't lift it.
[10966.00 - 10969.00] P:1357.01 E:0.070261 |  I'm wondering if it will be John Terry on his own
[10969.00 - 10971.00] P:1368.00 E:0.062623 |  or whether it will be Terry in Lampard.
[10971.00 - 10974.00] P:1424.22 E:0.053027 |  I would like to think that is what will happen
[10974.00 - 10976.00] P:1654.94 E:0.062140 |  and it will not just be John Terry.
[10976.00 - 10978.00] P:1568.12 E:0.060276 |  Because some of us, including me,
[10978.00 - 10982.00] P:1467.25 E:0.056284 |  have doubts about the morality of a player who's suspended
[10982.00 - 10985.00] P:1571.74 E:0.062369 |  for the final being allowed to raise the trophy.
[10985.00 - 10990.00] P:1602.14 E:0.056477 |  I'm not remotely underrated what John Terry has done
[10990.00 - 10992.00] P:1551.97 E:0.071934 |  for Chelsea in a magnificent career.
[10992.00 - 10995.00] P:1626.61 E:0.068496 |  What he's done for Chelsea in a magnificent season.
[10995.00 - 10998.00] P:1536.21 E:0.054471 |  But we have doubts.
[10998.00 - 11000.00] P:1433.07 E:0.068156 |  DiMitale has his winners medal.
[11000.00 - 11002.00] P:1370.21 E:0.057165 |  Basingua has his.
[11002.00 - 11005.00] P:1530.65 E:0.061274 |  Moreles, another suspension for the final.
[11005.00 - 11007.00] P:1388.88 E:0.059663 |  Has his winners medal.
[11009.00 - 11012.00] P:1382.69 E:0.058348 |  Now it's Sturridge, one of the substitutes
[11012.00 - 11014.00] P:1415.29 E:0.063048 |  who didn't make it onto the pitch.
[11014.00 - 11018.00] P:1298.23 E:0.056126 |  The young man Bertrand, who could not have expected
[11018.00 - 11021.00] P:1261.18 E:0.064156 |  when he made his way to Munich for this final
[11021.00 - 11024.00] P:1281.84 E:0.064741 |  that he'd be anything other than a substitute.
[11024.00 - 11026.00] P:1230.65 E:0.057381 |  Chelsea gather.
[11026.00 - 11028.00] P:1050.94 E:0.059126 |  They prefer to celebrate properly.
[11028.00 - 11031.00] P:1105.33 E:0.061364 |  It's wonderful that so many Bayern Munich fans
[11031.00 - 11033.00] P:1430.64 E:0.067092 |  have stayed in the arena.
[11033.00 - 11034.00] P:1708.90 E:0.064350 |  Yeah, it's class.
[11034.00 - 11036.00] P:1470.33 E:0.057229 |  Absolute class.
[11037.00 - 11040.00] P:1157.83 E:0.068728 |  They're ready. No big ears is there.
[11040.00 - 11044.00] P:1205.74 E:0.059661 |  Bayern Munich had hoped that they would be claiming that trophy
[11044.00 - 11047.00] P:1156.35 E:0.071956 |  and keeping that trophy because it would have meant
[11047.00 - 11049.00] P:1491.21 E:0.056010 |  their fifth triumph.
[11049.00 - 11051.00] P:1311.36 E:0.047761 |  But not tonight.
[11051.00 - 11054.00] P:1280.33 E:0.059320 |  Not tonight in their own stadium.
[11054.00 - 11057.00] P:1538.75 E:0.062504 |  Malouda has lost his shirt somewhere.
[11057.00 - 11059.00] P:1326.76 E:0.059936 |  Matters hung on to his.
[11059.00 - 11063.00] P:1256.66 E:0.070646 |  And his spondent, Arjen Robin, a former Chelsea player,
[11063.00 - 11064.00] P:1281.12 E:0.061572 |  looks off.
[11064.00 - 11068.00] P:1253.22 E:0.053214 |  And we look from a distance at the podium
[11068.00 - 11070.00] P:1547.09 E:0.069514 |  to see where John Terry is.
[11070.00 - 11072.00] P:1503.42 E:0.055587 |  He's still not in shot.
[11072.00 - 11075.00] P:1387.71 E:0.067835 |  Here's Ashley Cole, what a magnificent game he had.
[11075.00 - 11077.00] P:1259.25 E:0.064557 |  And Drogba, the big man.
[11077.00 - 11080.00] P:1336.52 E:0.061935 |  I don't always like some of his antics.
[11080.00 - 11084.00] P:1421.70 E:0.067139 |  But my goodness, he knows how to play when it really matters.
[11084.00 - 11087.00] P:1475.42 E:0.057706 |  Dramatic headed equalizer.
[11087.00 - 11092.00] P:1355.92 E:0.060855 |  I now see John Terry and Frank Lampard is nearby.
[11092.00 - 11095.00] P:1546.90 E:0.060026 |  Miesel Platini congratulates Terry.
[11095.00 - 11097.00] P:1524.59 E:0.062768 |  He congratulates Lampard.
[11097.00 - 11100.00] P:1010.31 E:0.063645 |  Hopefully it's the two of them.
[11100.00 - 11102.00] P:1348.23 E:0.070774 |  Well, that's huge funner.
[11102.00 - 11107.00] P:1179.10 E:0.062055 |  Before the game, Red Unzar Pocal from the Bayern fans.
[11107.00 - 11111.00] P:1309.20 E:0.052190 |  That meant translated R-Cup.
[11111.00 - 11115.00] P:1064.06 E:0.047188 |  Bayern is not your cup.
[11115.00 - 11118.00] P:1423.85 E:0.050910 |  This cup is going to London.
[11118.00 - 11122.00] P:1339.87 E:0.047262 |  It's back to England for the 12th time.
[11122.00 - 11125.00] P:1356.82 E:0.071370 |  And it will be Chelsea's first ever victory.
[11125.00 - 11129.00] P:1182.25 E:0.064313 |  And there is Lampard encouraging the fans.
[11129.00 - 11131.00] P:1449.76 E:0.069831 |  I've lost sight of John Terry.
[11131.00 - 11132.00] P:1473.30 E:0.059965 |  His arm is in there.
[11132.00 - 11134.00] P:1467.44 E:0.072502 |  So too is Lampard.
[11134.00 - 11136.00] P:1608.42 E:0.078073 |  The trophy is raised.
[11136.00 - 11138.00] P:1547.01 E:0.076962 |  And Chelsea are champions of Europe.
[11138.00 - 11142.00] P:1515.08 E:0.077892 |  And a fantastic night of football action here in Munich.
[11142.00 - 11144.00] P:1522.03 E:0.075964 |  Well done, Chelsea.
[11144.00 - 11146.00] P:1468.26 E:0.068470 |  Well done, Dimitri.
[11146.00 - 11150.00] P:1656.80 E:0.076345 |  For a club footballer, it was not a better moment than this.
[11150.00 - 11153.00] P:1633.28 E:0.077056 |  It doesn't sink in for ages and ages and ages.
[11153.00 - 11156.00] P:1637.35 E:0.078558 |  But eventually you realise you played in the best team
[11156.00 - 11159.00] P:1604.06 E:0.079507 |  in the whole of Europe that won the competition
[11159.00 - 11162.00] P:1643.48 E:0.072059 |  in front of everybody else.
[11162.00 - 11166.00] P:1643.32 E:0.073011 |  Can we collect this tinsel? I'm sure I'll make a fortune.
[11166.00 - 11168.00] P:1696.18 E:0.076221 |  Great night was the fight.
[11168.00 - 11169.00] P:2013.18 E:0.077615 |  Absolutely.
[11169.00 - 11173.00] P:1834.96 E:0.076235 |  Football's ability to astound and astonish continues.
[11173.00 - 11175.00] P:1899.85 E:0.078144 |  Because it wasn't a particularly good game,
[11175.00 - 11177.00] P:1852.43 E:0.066387 |  but it was so gripping.
[11177.00 - 11179.00] P:1852.04 E:0.065878 |  And you thought, Steve Bruce, didn't you?
[11179.00 - 11181.00] P:1993.07 E:0.061088 |  Well, you know what? Bayern Munich, they're not actually that good a team,
[11181.00 - 11183.00] P:1925.54 E:0.063450 |  but they've done enough and they deserve to win.
[11183.00 - 11184.00] P:1690.30 E:0.054236 |  There's no doubt about that.
[11184.00 - 11186.00] P:1683.45 E:0.058553 |  And Drogber comes up with that goal,
[11186.00 - 11187.00] P:1909.93 E:0.065438 |  then gives away a penalty.
[11187.00 - 11190.00] P:1599.50 E:0.056663 |  That's missed and then scores the winning penalty.
[11190.00 - 11192.00] P:1556.16 E:0.071376 |  It's quite bizarre football, isn't it?
[11192.00 - 11194.00] P:1571.90 E:0.066951 |  How often do we see it?
[11194.00 - 11197.00] P:1778.05 E:0.068577 |  How often do we all, as coaches, managers, analyse stats,
[11197.00 - 11199.00] P:1580.50 E:0.055625 |  to go out the window?
[11199.00 - 11202.00] P:1697.63 E:0.062098 |  Sometimes in a cup final, you need that bit of luck.
[11202.00 - 11204.00] P:1749.11 E:0.063678 |  Chelsea's name was written on it.
[11204.00 - 11206.00] P:1649.02 E:0.062571 |  Let's be fair for the last six, eight weeks.
[11206.00 - 11208.00] P:1669.97 E:0.063724 |  It must have been the luck they've carried,
[11208.00 - 11210.00] P:1700.19 E:0.067902 |  but also the courage they've shown
[11210.00 - 11212.00] P:1655.20 E:0.065945 |  and the way they've turned the season round.
[11212.00 - 11215.00] P:1678.17 E:0.065403 |  And I am genuinely pleased that the four, five lads
[11215.00 - 11218.00] P:1695.08 E:0.064898 |  who have been Chelsea, Mr Abramovich can change the coaches
[11218.00 - 11221.00] P:1827.96 E:0.064146 |  and he can obviously change managers.
[11221.00 - 11223.00] P:1621.23 E:0.071757 |  But the one thing he's had over the last few years
[11223.00 - 11227.00] P:1601.09 E:0.066897 |  is he's been able to rely on Terry, Lampard,
[11227.00 - 11231.00] P:1572.95 E:0.059180 |  Czech, Drogber, and particularly Lampard, Ashley Cole as well.
[11231.00 - 11235.00] P:1640.52 E:0.065815 |  They've been the rock, so they've always created
[11235.00 - 11237.00] P:1694.04 E:0.056132 |  a spirit at Chelsea and as we've seen it tonight,
[11237.00 - 11239.00] P:1684.74 E:0.064069 |  it goes a long way.
[11239.00 - 11241.00] P:1684.41 E:0.056852 |  You just wonder about, don't you?
[11241.00 - 11243.00] P:1602.43 E:0.061168 |  What Anders Villes Boas would feel at this moment.
[11243.00 - 11244.00] P:1725.17 E:0.070755 |  Oh yes, I forgot about it.
[11244.00 - 11245.00] P:1752.14 E:0.062553 |  It'd be Tarly.
[11245.00 - 11248.00] P:1794.21 E:0.064911 |  Well, his record, Demeter, since taking over from ABB
[11248.00 - 11252.00] P:1615.87 E:0.065808 |  in 10 weeks, has won 14, drawn four, lost three,
[11252.00 - 11253.00] P:1818.81 E:0.064497 |  won the FA Cup.
[11253.00 - 11256.00] P:1760.26 E:0.071838 |  There's John Terry, that's the photograph he'll want.
[11256.00 - 11259.00] P:1690.35 E:0.060591 |  Won the FA Cup, won the Champions League.
[11259.00 - 11262.00] P:1635.27 E:0.068353 |  Now there's a little similarity straight away.
[11262.00 - 11264.00] P:1677.99 E:0.074414 |  Obviously you do, Steve, because you were there,
[11264.00 - 11265.00] P:1631.74 E:0.064772 |  but we all picked up on him.
[11265.00 - 11267.00] P:1701.58 E:0.066963 |  The fact that Lampard and Terry picked the trophy up together,
[11267.00 - 11269.00] P:1721.98 E:0.074577 |  just like you and Brian Robson picked the trophy up
[11269.00 - 11271.00] P:1855.24 E:0.068972 |  when United first won the title.
[11271.00 - 11273.00] P:1714.63 E:0.067229 |  It seems a long time ago and you're right.
[11273.00 - 11276.00] P:1576.49 E:0.061501 |  I mean, when I was captain of United, Brian Robson had been there
[11276.00 - 11279.00] P:1600.38 E:0.062576 |  something like 10, 13 years and never quite managed
[11279.00 - 11280.00] P:1775.40 E:0.057048 |  to be on the winning team.
[11280.00 - 11282.00] P:1440.68 E:0.070170 |  It was only the right thing to do.
[11282.00 - 11284.00] P:1562.87 E:0.064351 |  And to be fair, that's what creates a spirit as well,
[11284.00 - 11290.00] P:1586.67 E:0.063406 |  that the two egos can both go up and say, do it together.
[11290.00 - 11292.00] P:1541.58 E:0.060853 |  I think Zimba Teo gets sacked in the morning,
[11292.00 - 11294.00] P:1461.52 E:0.066495 |  failed to win the Premiership and the Carlin Cup.
[11294.00 - 11295.00] P:1596.54 E:0.062169 |  Exactly.
[11295.00 - 11297.00] P:1596.90 E:0.062543 |  I think they might have been out of the Carlin Cup by then,
[11297.00 - 11299.00] P:1837.55 E:0.068445 |  but definitely the Premier League, only finished sick.
[11299.00 - 11302.00] P:1744.14 E:0.059950 |  Now, just a clarification, it's a minor thing,
[11302.00 - 11303.00] P:1744.96 E:0.065728 |  but not if you support Arsenal.
[11303.00 - 11306.00] P:1734.94 E:0.067939 |  Arsenal do go straight into the group stages.
[11306.00 - 11309.00] P:1706.98 E:0.057761 |  They don't drop into the qualifier.
[11309.00 - 11311.00] P:1901.96 E:0.063670 |  OK, so that's obviously good news for Arsenal.
[11311.00 - 11313.00] P:1895.32 E:0.063288 |  They don't get that potentially nasty qualifier,
[11313.00 - 11316.00] P:1674.98 E:0.062122 |  but Tottenham, of course, are in the Europa League
[11316.00 - 11318.00] P:1660.74 E:0.073251 |  and Tottenham have paid the price for a really poor end
[11318.00 - 11322.00] P:1772.26 E:0.059082 |  of the season there, with Arsenal pipping them to third spot
[11322.00 - 11324.00] P:1722.87 E:0.058733 |  and obvious automatic qualification.
[11324.00 - 11326.00] P:1933.36 E:0.066970 |  You missed the shot, see, we just look in the other way.
[11326.00 - 11328.00] P:1773.28 E:0.059509 |  Roman Abramovich picked up the cup as well,
[11328.00 - 11330.00] P:1666.30 E:0.064595 |  physically picked it up as well.
[11330.00 - 11332.00] P:1718.80 E:0.058677 |  Farinac, he spent a billion.
[11332.00 - 11335.00] P:1695.11 E:0.064000 |  I think he spent a billion quid or whatever it's been
[11335.00 - 11337.00] P:1568.06 E:0.066334 |  and fair play to him.
[11337.00 - 11339.00] P:1848.68 E:0.063366 |  I don't think we've seen him so animated.
[11339.00 - 11341.00] P:1777.54 E:0.070300 |  It's nice to see that he has enjoyed it,
[11341.00 - 11344.00] P:1763.63 E:0.067110 |  because sometimes being the leader of the whole lot,
[11344.00 - 11346.00] P:1807.59 E:0.067140 |  it does become a bit stressful.
[11346.00 - 11348.00] P:1682.29 E:0.066467 |  He's had a wonderful, wonderful night
[11348.00 - 11351.00] P:1747.06 E:0.064938 |  and it's probably why he's come into the game.
[11351.00 - 11354.00] P:1760.49 E:0.065960 |  Tonight he's done it, now will he bankroll them again?
[11354.00 - 11357.00] P:1679.74 E:0.065814 |  He's going to have to replace the five players
[11357.00 - 11358.00] P:1828.29 E:0.057102 |  we've been mentioning all night.
[11358.00 - 11360.00] P:1880.57 E:0.071336 |  I just spotted Tomaszuk, who is completely on the ground.
[11360.00 - 11363.00] P:1879.57 E:0.069326 |  I always remember the late great Peter Jones once describing
[11363.00 - 11366.00] P:1725.78 E:0.065185 |  Joe Jordan as flat out as if he's on a Spanish beach,
[11366.00 - 11369.00] P:1733.76 E:0.067356 |  after Manchester United had lost a cup final
[11369.00 - 11371.00] P:1649.98 E:0.075428 |  and they can barely move.
[11371.00 - 11374.00] P:1579.24 E:0.073122 |  There's Timoteo, that's the roar for Timoteo.
[11374.00 - 11376.00] P:1535.27 E:0.065957 |  Not bad for an interim.
[11376.00 - 11379.00] P:1606.03 E:0.078508 |  Not bad at all, the FA Cup and the European Cup.
[11379.00 - 11382.00] P:1505.25 E:0.069203 |  Not bad for a man sacked by West Brom.
[11382.00 - 11384.00] P:1594.40 E:0.078598 |  We've had too many stories really this season
[11384.00 - 11386.00] P:1735.41 E:0.062745 |  to get our heads around, Steve.
[11386.00 - 11388.00] P:1670.54 E:0.075031 |  It's quite remarkable and Mark's quite right.
[11388.00 - 11390.00] P:1560.86 E:0.065318 |  I wonder what Willis Boas is thinking tonight.
[11390.00 - 11392.00] P:1645.31 E:0.066530 |  He's thinking what on earth has happened to me
[11392.00 - 11394.00] P:1599.68 E:0.066677 |  in the last 10, 11 weeks.
[11394.00 - 11397.00] P:1543.76 E:0.063728 |  He's seen his team come from nowhere
[11397.00 - 11400.00] P:1253.68 E:0.052364 |  and go and win in the new camp.
[11400.00 - 11403.00] P:1381.68 E:0.068321 |  Let's be fair, go and win here by Hooker by Crook.
[11403.00 - 11405.00] P:1230.58 E:0.059436 |  They've gone everywhere and won away from home.
[11405.00 - 11407.00] P:1360.24 E:0.057773 |  A wonderful, wonderful achievement.
[11407.00 - 11410.00] P:1424.67 E:0.065766 |  And as I keep saying, thoroughly deserved by the four or five
[11410.00 - 11412.00] P:1542.19 E:0.061059 |  who've created the spirit of Chelsea.
[11412.00 - 11414.00] P:1436.06 E:0.062240 |  They might be getting a little bit older,
[11414.00 - 11416.00] P:1323.22 E:0.059182 |  your lampards and your terrors,
[11416.00 - 11418.00] P:1085.99 E:0.053801 |  but they've done fantastically well as a group.
[11418.00 - 11420.00] P:1429.75 E:0.066938 |  By a minute it weren't great, Mark.
[11420.00 - 11422.00] P:1308.76 E:0.068158 |  Let's be honest, they were quite predictable by the end,
[11422.00 - 11425.00] P:1747.52 E:0.069227 |  but we did think they'd just done enough to shade it 1-0.
[11425.00 - 11428.00] P:1633.64 E:0.071101 |  Well, I think also, you know, the save check made in the first half
[11428.00 - 11432.00] P:1450.14 E:0.071737 |  where it hit his foot, went on to the angled post and bar.
[11432.00 - 11435.00] P:1465.95 E:0.066517 |  Great chance as well at one stage for Muller, left foot, first half,
[11435.00 - 11438.00] P:1529.42 E:0.065237 |  and then Gomez as well had an outstanding chance.
[11438.00 - 11440.00] P:1581.24 E:0.065214 |  And they also thought they'd nicked a goal in the second half,
[11440.00 - 11443.00] P:1399.80 E:0.066014 |  didn't they, through Ribbery, which was a close call.
[11443.00 - 11447.00] P:1468.96 E:0.060823 |  But listen, you know, on the evidence of the last six to eight weeks,
[11447.00 - 11449.00] P:1546.68 E:0.062522 |  as Steve said, Chelsea were running good.
[11449.00 - 11451.00] P:1668.69 E:0.069192 |  Why did we ever doubt that they were ever ever going to win?
[11451.00 - 11453.00] P:1666.95 E:0.061248 |  They were ever ever going to win this competition.
[11453.00 - 11455.00] P:1624.07 E:0.062619 |  It was written, Mark.
[11455.00 - 11456.00] P:1686.98 E:0.074642 |  It's an encore.
[11456.00 - 11458.00] P:1761.62 E:0.071063 |  Tindy O'Drogge was taking the encore now,
[11458.00 - 11460.00] P:1613.01 E:0.071343 |  and it's just like being at the theatre.
[11460.00 - 11463.00] P:1606.41 E:0.070183 |  He's the main man, back by himself in the D, taking the applause,
[11463.00 - 11465.00] P:1765.19 E:0.068942 |  and you can understand why.
[11465.00 - 11469.00] P:1595.14 E:0.063770 |  To have a player like that, nine goals in nine finals.
[11469.00 - 11472.00] P:1679.76 E:0.069551 |  Big players, we were talking about it last night when you were saying,
[11472.00 - 11474.00] P:1758.00 E:0.069698 |  we were talking about players freezing.
[11474.00 - 11476.00] P:1640.39 E:0.063131 |  Was the antithesis of that?
[11476.00 - 11479.00] P:1576.90 E:0.066340 |  When you know, when you're sitting in an address and before a big cub,
[11479.00 - 11482.00] P:1501.24 E:0.065511 |  you're going to have to tell him and know that he's going to show up.
[11482.00 - 11485.00] P:1431.42 E:0.071348 |  He's going to turn up, be the big player that he is.
[11485.00 - 11488.00] P:1446.89 E:0.065055 |  And that's what makes the great players and make no mistake.
[11488.00 - 11490.00] P:1556.39 E:0.068459 |  Sometimes the word great is used too often.
[11490.00 - 11493.00] P:1613.42 E:0.067650 |  This fella here is a really, really great player.
[11493.00 - 11496.00] P:1512.48 E:0.070791 |  In big occasions, you know, he's antithesis of times,
[11496.00 - 11499.00] P:1521.19 E:0.062445 |  he falls over and dives him out at times, but make no mistake,
[11499.00 - 11501.00] P:1758.53 E:0.066545 |  when the big trophies are there, he can certainly produce.
[11501.00 - 11504.00] P:1764.38 E:0.072045 |  Now, 6-0-6 with Alan is going to start off to the news at the top of the hour.
[11504.00 - 11508.00] P:1787.08 E:0.065208 |  0-500-909-69-3, 8-5-0-5-8 on the text.
[11508.00 - 11511.00] P:1665.71 E:0.072112 |  Chelsea players now having their photographs taken with the trophy.
[11511.00 - 11514.00] P:1658.01 E:0.073130 |  These are the photographs you'll see in your newspapers tomorrow morning.
[11514.00 - 11518.00] P:1468.78 E:0.073904 |  Fernando Torres with a Spanish flag wrapped around his waist.
[11518.00 - 11520.00] P:1704.46 E:0.071330 |  He may not even be going to the Euros, Mark.
[11520.00 - 11524.00] P:1501.72 E:0.069789 |  He's had a horrendous season, but he does have an FA Cup winners medal
[11524.00 - 11526.00] P:1819.74 E:0.066210 |  and a Champions League winners medal.
[11526.00 - 11528.00] P:1474.46 E:0.068379 |  Yeah, and in fairness, probably in the last couple of months,
[11528.00 - 11531.00] P:1473.68 E:0.076996 |  he has improved under Roberto de Matere,
[11531.00 - 11535.00] P:1529.32 E:0.063386 |  but he's under all sorts of pressure for his place in this Spanish squad, surely.
[11535.00 - 11538.00] P:1491.30 E:0.070614 |  But listen, don't forget that, you know, Abramovich bought him
[11538.00 - 11542.00] P:1376.43 E:0.068207 |  and he bought David Louis, what, sort of January, 18 months ago,
[11542.00 - 11544.00] P:1427.51 E:0.079949 |  and they thought they could win the Champions League last year.
[11544.00 - 11547.00] P:1553.23 E:0.074431 |  They've done it this year. They won't be bothered.
[11547.00 - 11551.00] P:1729.65 E:0.080846 |  Well, it's 5-12 local time here in Munich,
[11551.00 - 11555.00] P:1699.26 E:0.079707 |  and if you're a Chelsea fan, you recognise that song,
[11555.00 - 11558.00] P:1724.40 E:0.080666 |  and the Chelsea players have now run with the European Cup
[11558.00 - 11562.00] P:1616.80 E:0.077687 |  and are sitting in the penalty area way to our left
[11562.00 - 11565.00] P:1668.10 E:0.078019 |  in front of those Chelsea fans who have seen heartbreak
[11565.00 - 11570.00] P:1669.87 E:0.078373 |  in semi-finals going all the way back to Claudio Ranieri's day against Monaco
[11570.00 - 11573.00] P:1660.52 E:0.081379 |  when he tinkered quite bizarrely, Steve,
[11573.00 - 11576.00] P:1769.12 E:0.080137 |  and lost to a Monaco team, and really, they should have been.
[11576.00 - 11580.00] P:1664.32 E:0.079630 |  And since then, it's been pitfall after mishap after upset,
[11580.00 - 11581.00] P:1701.98 E:0.080721 |  and it's finally come round.
[11581.00 - 11585.00] P:1689.39 E:0.079239 |  What is quite remarkable as well is, you know, the beating of six semi-finals,
[11585.00 - 11588.00] P:1641.46 E:0.078946 |  you know, it's quite remarkable over the last decade.
[11588.00 - 11591.00] P:1805.25 E:0.081148 |  Something like six semi-finals is incredible.
[11591.00 - 11595.00] P:1650.26 E:0.078911 |  They're finally here today, and on a big occasion, they've produced,
[11595.00 - 11599.00] P:1691.73 E:0.081306 |  and you have to take your hats off to them and let them and go and enjoy,
[11599.00 - 11602.00] P:1788.69 E:0.082090 |  enjoy what they're obviously experiencing now,
[11602.00 - 11605.00] P:1716.02 E:0.078082 |  because it's the most fantastic feeling.
[11605.00 - 11608.00] P:1688.25 E:0.079201 |  Well, there are a couple of players who have been quite underrated,
[11608.00 - 11611.00] P:1822.83 E:0.078409 |  but have very good games this evening, waiting the trophy now,
[11611.00 - 11615.00] P:1693.08 E:0.075039 |  but the single were in Miquel's, the single sometimes were in Stafford Bridge,
[11615.00 - 11617.00] P:1744.48 E:0.080498 |  and people are telling us about it, bringing them on.
[11617.00 - 11619.00] P:1698.66 E:0.080948 |  I remember what I'm getting now, people are howling,
[11619.00 - 11621.00] P:1760.88 E:0.073173 |  telling them to sit down, we don't want him on.
[11621.00 - 11624.00] P:1712.54 E:0.076525 |  Well, he looked for quite a part of the season,
[11624.00 - 11627.00] P:1737.23 E:0.074403 |  as though he was totally disinterested and didn't want to be there,
[11627.00 - 11631.00] P:1719.94 E:0.072457 |  but he was at his game tonight, most definitely, and he needed to be in.
[11631.00 - 11635.00] P:1670.70 E:0.071262 |  And John Obi-Milchow was left out for a while, couldn't get anywhere near the team,
[11635.00 - 11638.00] P:1681.11 E:0.074535 |  and as Dimitiel slowly took over, Mark,
[11638.00 - 11642.00] P:1742.99 E:0.074032 |  and the formation of the team changed, and the shape of the team changed as well.
[11642.00 - 11647.00] P:1714.67 E:0.069728 |  And let's be fair with Dimitiel, tactically, he's got absolutely everything spot on,
[11647.00 - 11652.00] P:1857.64 E:0.068867 |  but I just thought tonight, Ashley Cole again was just brilliant.
[11652.00 - 11654.00] P:1809.19 E:0.070065 |  Absolutely brilliant.
[11654.00 - 11656.00] P:1985.47 E:0.077226 |  Well, we talked about him today, about how good he is.
[11656.00 - 11659.00] P:2004.21 E:0.075168 |  Now it's David Luisa, the Scottish fans at Wembley in 75,
[11659.00 - 11663.00] P:1886.95 E:0.071760 |  he's sitting on top of the crossbar with a Brazilian flag wrapped around him,
[11663.00 - 11665.00] P:1888.26 E:0.071873 |  and a thought for Ryan Bertrand.
[11665.00 - 11666.00] P:1849.54 E:0.074907 |  Wow.
[11666.00 - 11669.00] P:1869.51 E:0.071791 |  Because he's going to wake up tomorrow morning, I think with a medal probably under his pillow,
[11669.00 - 11671.00] P:1931.51 E:0.074284 |  or still around his head.
[11671.00 - 11673.00] P:1734.93 E:0.074190 |  You know that is the fantastic thing about football,
[11673.00 - 11677.00] P:1699.59 E:0.072314 |  I think it only a matter of months ago, was the Jullingham for a year.
[11677.00 - 11679.00] P:1872.65 E:0.067085 |  You know, they're going to learn his trade.
[11679.00 - 11682.00] P:1668.62 E:0.069019 |  Here he's been given a chance by the manager, did fantastically well.
[11682.00 - 11686.00] P:1569.51 E:0.067516 |  In the vital first hour of the game, did fantastically well.
[11686.00 - 11690.00] P:1645.11 E:0.058247 |  The tactic was to see if they could go the distance, they went the distance,
[11690.00 - 11692.00] P:1637.19 E:0.056771 |  and I was always predicted.
[11692.00 - 11695.00] P:1683.74 E:0.066708 |  I always thought if they went the distance, they'll win the game.
[11695.00 - 11698.00] P:1537.35 E:0.060245 |  Maybe not on penalties, but fantastic for him.
[11698.00 - 11700.00] P:1466.85 E:0.057661 |  It certainly is.
[11700.00 - 11703.00] P:1882.93 E:0.069137 |  They're playing all the favourite Chelsea songs, as you can hear.
[11703.00 - 11708.00] P:1788.64 E:0.066950 |  The Bayern fans are dragging themselves disconsolently away.
[11708.00 - 11711.00] P:1796.45 E:0.074393 |  There's another one coming out of the PA,
[11711.00 - 11714.00] P:1736.10 E:0.071583 |  and the Chelsea fans are now starting an impromptu dance,
[11714.00 - 11716.00] P:1610.84 E:0.073144 |  and who can blame them?
[11716.00 - 11718.00] P:1599.14 E:0.071613 |  It might take them a few days to get home,
[11718.00 - 11721.00] P:1779.01 E:0.073660 |  but with two minutes to go in the game, they would have never believed it,
[11721.00 - 11725.00] P:1756.95 E:0.069498 |  and of course such, Leasinger of Madness is a massive Chelsea fan.
[11725.00 - 11727.00] P:1942.71 E:0.069031 |  It might even be here, you never know.
[11727.00 - 11731.00] P:1866.11 E:0.067872 |  I think Seb Coe wanted to come here, maybe he has on the way back from Athens.
[11731.00 - 11733.00] P:1892.27 E:0.064474 |  Huge Chelsea fan as well.
[11733.00 - 11736.00] P:1971.34 E:0.064098 |  A day they will never, ever forget.
[11736.00 - 11738.00] P:2057.96 E:0.067251 |  We have to look the other side briefly, Mark, for Bayern Munich,
[11738.00 - 11742.00] P:1877.34 E:0.070252 |  lose the Bundesliga, lose the German Cup, lose on penalties here.
[11742.00 - 11744.00] P:1945.74 E:0.064106 |  That's a deep scar.
[11744.00 - 11747.00] P:1735.50 E:0.063676 |  It is a deep scar, Mark, and the thing about it, you know,
[11747.00 - 11749.00] P:1714.32 E:0.066374 |  and we have to be completely neutral here,
[11749.00 - 11752.00] P:1819.02 E:0.062582 |  but they were the better team than Chelsea tonight.
[11752.00 - 11754.00] P:1880.26 E:0.063087 |  It doesn't matter as far as Chelsea's concerned,
[11754.00 - 11756.00] P:1956.67 E:0.073178 |  but they were the better team.
[11756.00 - 11760.00] P:1867.68 E:0.063393 |  I want to note, a few weeks ago, when Manchester United went out,
[11760.00 - 11762.00] P:1766.94 E:0.060969 |  Manchester City went out, also went out,
[11762.00 - 11765.00] P:1806.73 E:0.070915 |  we were belittling the Premier League teams,
[11765.00 - 11768.00] P:1774.57 E:0.060532 |  the Champions League, what on earth has happened to our teams,
[11768.00 - 11771.00] P:1710.67 E:0.061722 |  and lo and behold, an English team goes and wins it.
[11771.00 - 11775.00] P:1898.51 E:0.069134 |  The beauty of football is that you can be the inferior team and still win.
[11775.00 - 11778.00] P:1971.63 E:0.069901 |  It can't really happen in any either Coda Rugby or Cricket on the whole,
[11778.00 - 11781.00] P:1917.41 E:0.069375 |  because of the way that the game is structured in terms of scoring and points.
[11781.00 - 11785.00] P:1766.33 E:0.061677 |  In a one-off, in a one-off cup final, a cup final,
[11785.00 - 11787.00] P:1906.78 E:0.068515 |  if you need that little bit of luck with Chelsea hard,
[11787.00 - 11790.00] P:1854.23 E:0.063511 |  there's no doubt at all that Bayern Munich were the better team on the night.
[11790.00 - 11792.00] P:1895.66 E:0.057662 |  There's no discrepancy, there's no disputing that.
[11792.00 - 11794.00] P:1829.33 E:0.063144 |  However, they haven't won the trophy,
[11794.00 - 11796.00] P:1857.54 E:0.061515 |  and how often do we say that in football?
[11796.00 - 11799.00] P:1911.90 E:0.063733 |  That's where, in the biggest stage like this, you need that bit of luck.
[11799.00 - 11801.00] P:2036.74 E:0.067327 |  And over the years, Chelsea have deserved it.
[11801.00 - 11805.00] P:1877.40 E:0.062492 |  That horrible night in Moscow, when they've missed John Cherry's missed the penalty.
[11805.00 - 11806.00] P:1881.74 E:0.066919 |  All of that is forgotten.
[11806.00 - 11807.00] P:1943.52 E:0.063598 |  It certainly is.
[11807.00 - 11810.00] P:1983.28 E:0.066173 |  Ped传ek on the shoulders of the Chelsea players.
[11810.00 - 11813.00] P:1985.78 E:0.061289 |  Chelsea have won the Champions League,
[11813.00 - 11817.00] P:2010.78 E:0.061463 |  6-0-6 with Alan Green is up after the news with Suzanne Cisner.
