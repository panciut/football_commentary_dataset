  "transcript": " It will not be a full house in Baku, it's a big stadium but still a large crowd somewhere in the region of 60,000 or so. It's blue against red, it's Chelsea against Arsenal and at a budget we are almost ready to get on the way. It just seems so surreal. Here we are in the Europa League final, Arsenal beat Chelsea and a stadium that's not full and I look back on the history of this game. So many classic encounters and yet we have only one Englishman starting so it's a, it kind of feels kind of strange but so important for both clubs tonight, for Sarri the manager and for Arsenal to get that champion league spot, massive, massive game and I'm really looking forward to it. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang stands inside the centre circle, he'll be the man to get this Europa League final started. Chelsea, Arsenal have already released plans to hold a trophy parade in Islington tomorrow if they are the team who triumphs. Chelsea players had a little giggle of that in the press conference yesterday, they'll be setting out to ensure it doesn't happen. In Golo Kante gets a touch of the ball for the first time, 10 yards inside the Arsenal half, Chelsea play it back to David Louise who was involved in that scuffle between team-mates on the pitch here last night, well publicised moment which led to Maurizio Sarri storming off the pitch, will there be a reaction from Chelsea tonight as it's played in field by Aspel Aquetta and Chelsea get it out to the left-hand side and Emerson will give you a reminder of the full teams when we get a break in play but Kovicic back into his own half, it's all Chelsea, Arsenal having had a touch so far, David Louise pings a long-range ball looking for Petro, had a huge roar from the Arsenal fans as Petticec comes out and it was a comfortable save but they just love that he's had a positive first touch. Yeah, I think that's what Peter would have liked, a nice floaty ball to come out and collect but it's interesting already the two Chelsea fullbacks are going to get a lot of space tonight and I can notice there was right out on the touch line trying to stretch this Arsenal team so an interesting tactical point at the start. Jack plays it out to Montréal just outside the Arsenal penalty area, there was a heavy touch there I think by Granada Jack but he recovered to clear it long into the Chelsea half. Chelsea gained possession with the Dane, Andreas Christensen who helps it back to keeper Rita Balaga the Spaniard. Well, quite a high profile season particularly those scenes. The last time Chelsea played in a final, the League Cup final when he refused to be substituted. Chelsea lost to Manchester City on spot kicks in the end. We could have penalties tonight in Baku one way or the other, we get a winner tonight as a miscue in defence by Socrates but Azar isn't able to bounce on it but Jack had a miscue, Socrates had a miscue, Arsenal's defence which is always a worry for them, it hasn't had a completely 100% solid start here so far. Early stages, two minutes played in Baku, Chelsea did Arsenal now. Yeah, I think Chelsea just thought I'm a move of the ball, it was interesting to see Ozil go around Drogenio and Drogenio still managed to get his pass off, he just needs a little, you know, that kind of lazy style that Ozil has defensively, he's going to need to be on his game today for sure. Lovely clearance from keeper Rita Balaga, but Kovačić unable to keep it in play and Arsenal win possession here for the first time really in the Chelsea half. Played in field, Jack along to Montréal, bogged down in the midfield though it's taken time to spread it out to Kolasinac to the far side. Aspelik Kweta comes close to Kip Tamsen even, Arsenal forced back again to the halfway line and Laurent Kishelny was injured in the semi-final of the Europa League last season, ended up missing the World Cup as a result which of course his nation France went on to win this time round and he's got further than the Europa League semis, here he is captaining his side in the final itself, it will drag back for the Frenchman. Low ball into the midfield to Lucas Torreira, just short of the halfway line, right hand side as Arsenal come forward, heavy touch by Maitland Niles, Azard is in to try and bounce on it and then Maitland Niles fouls in and Azard free kick to Chelsea just inside the Arsenal half, Alain Parjik. Yeah, just a few too many errors from Arsenal's final view in possession, but the game's settling down both obviously two different systems, so one just trying to dictate to the other, Chelsea just got the line share at the moment and again a mistake there and now Arsenal in position again, just trying to settle down the game. You see Unai Emery stride out to the edge of the technical area, Mr Europa League in many respects, he has won this competition more than any other manager 2014, 2015, 2016 with Sevilla's Montréal clears it away for Arsenal, up over the halfway line stretching Christianson managers to keep it in play and now in Golo Cante with a touch and again just like the warm up, you're feeling Golo Cante isn't exerting himself here, the bare minimum there is he kept it moving in the midfield and Chelsea get it to their danger at, Eden Azard, midway inside the Arsenal half, sets off an amazing dribble, turns back at himself short of the penalty area, support from Covacic and now back to the centre circle once again and Chelsea will start from scratch, Christianson, little dummy by Azard but nobody's behind him to take it and Maitland Niles will help it back to Petticec, so a reminder of the teams, Caporita Balaga the goalkeeper for Chelsea, they are officially the home team in terms of UEFA designation despite being two and a half thousand miles away from home, Aspel Aquetta, Christianson, Luis and Emerson the back four, Cante, Giorginho, at Covacic in the midfield, Pedro, Giroux and Azard the three up front, for Arsenal Petticec is the goalkeeper, three central defenders for them, Socrates, Kishelny and Monreal, Maitland Niles and Colasen actually wing backs, Terera and Jacque in the middle of the park, Mesut Ersel who's hardly had a touch if he has had a touch so far, he's the number ten position behind Lacazette and Obamayang, much made Alan of the potent nature of Arsenal's front three but they've got to get the ball first, we've played six minutes, those three have hardly had a touch, yeah you're two central midfield players and you in your centre backs need to be much better in possession than they've been, they've given the ball away and turned it over to Chelsea and they're starting to just get a little bit of a feel for it Chelsea I think, Azard has been on the ball as you'd expect in that little pocket, Fal committed by David Louise on Lacazette ten yards inside the Chelsea half for the first time Arsenal have a free kick inside the reported south that was trademark David Louise there, I mean no attempt really to play the ball, happily conceding the free kick just to let Lacazette know he's there, yeah and Obamayang had a feel from Christensen as well just making them half the centre backs as you'd expect, Mesut Ersel's only had one touch to the ball so far he's about to have his second to take the free kick left footed high towards the far side of the penalty area, Colasen was trying to creep in defending Olivier Giroud against his old team back pedals he was trying to put it out for a throw I think he's put it out for a corner or a throw and I thought the referee was indicating to the quarter flag it is a throw in right down in that location for Arsenal so their first proper attack of the game, terrible throw, Colasen at straight to Georgina and that's just giving away position Katte is beaten to it by Torera, Lacazette gets a chance, Jacque does well to keep it moving and Arsenal have a crossing position left hand side, Colasen at his attempted cross though cut out by Aspel at quite a Chelsea clear it away for a throw still nil nil on five live and BBC Radio London. Yeah I mean Katte looks like he's fine to me I mean I've watched him just that first sort of five six minutes there and he's moving well he looks fine so I don't think there's a much to worry about there I think in that period you would have seen something so that would be great news for the manager great news for Chelsea. This all English Europa League final, Colasen atch turns and rolls it back to Petticec for a long time ranked as the best goalkeeper in the world tonight playing as a professional for the final time. Arsenal come down the left Lacazette controls but immediately Georgina is in to win it off and that's Neaton Tidy from Georgina, Chelsea get it back, Davy Louise on the edge of the D of the penalty area that Chelsea defend and he just scoops it out to Emerson the left back who's put under pressure by Maitland Niles and Chelsea retreat to their goalkeeper caper and both teams still just feeling it to the right here as Chelsea try to play their way out of defense. Aspel acquitted, loops it forward and Golucante controls and he's up a thigh, shifts it on to Georgina up towards Olivier Giroud not a good enough ball cut out by Kishelny. Arsenal find a bit of space now for Maitland Niles down the right hand side, Obamian gets involved back to Maitland Niles crossing position to the ball and whipped in with power keeper Flokson follow-up shot by Obamian is left and wide it's the first real chance of the game it's taken eight minutes and Obamian didn't catch it as cleanly as he would have wished. Oh and Maitland Niles was you know he encouraged to join in their lead hazard which is nice to see he has that freedom to do that got down the right hand side good cross across the near post and Kepper made a bit of a hash of that he looked nervous he punched it out into the middle and then the shot from the striker GS wide good chance for Arsenal. It was not a floated cross from Maitland Niles it was drilled in a keeper struggled to deal with it and on another day Obamian might have done better with Kepper out of position somewhat the goal a little bit at his mercy there's an awkward hide again spinning at him but the player of the quality of Pierre-Emerick Obamian he might well have expected to hit the target there right free kick for Arsenal inside their own half taken by Kishelny short to the Uruguayan Lucas Torera coming to the end of his first season as an Arsenal player Maitland Niles finds himself immediately tackled by Emerson as the ball comes his way and that goes out for a throw into Arsenal right in front of Mauricio Sarri who we know that as he arrived was wearing a suit very smart to tell you it's a feeling I've ever seen Mauricio Sarri wear a suit he looked great but the game is underway and he's back and he's regular attire and he's got the floppy top and the tight tracky bottoms and the trainers and he's down there and arms folded across his chest and observing the opening stages of this Europa League final here in Baku in Azerbaijan where you can smell the petrol fumes in the air David Louise floats it forward right foot it towards Olivier Giroud gets it at the second attempt helped by Eden Azad gives it back to the Belgian lovely shift of weight from his left to his right there to create a bit of space by Azad and now Pedro's involved 15 yards outside the Arsenal peddle the area Azad's hungry here he runs into possession and receives it again twist one way then the other Arsenal defenders of Fates to Lugin now they do Azad goes down into the penalty area nothing doing with the referee who doesn't even give it a second look he was challenged outside the box he fell into the penalty area Eden Azad the referee was well located he said play on and Arsenal looked to clear it away here down the right hand side Alampardji what do you make of that well that was brilliant from Hazard he got it on this this left hand side done a little bit got it back into midfield and then went right across the other side of the pitch played a brilliant one too and then it was so difficult to see from here where he was actually caught or he took a dive just seeing the replay now looked to me like a foul so a little bit unlucky then Hazard he was a there's a great bit of play though the only only sort of play Hazard can do yeah you can see in that moment that he is up for this game he had an energy and enthusiasm he was involved three different times at three different locations and Arsenal might well off their hands full keeping tabs on Eden Azad tonight here comes Kovacic the Croatian who this time last year was getting ready to play in the World Cup but of course he got all the way to the final as well as the Frenchman and show him as it runs the ball out of play he's a look at it was trying to to dribble it along the chalk of the touch line but it does go out and that will be a throw into Chelsea just in front of Mauricio Sarri 12 minutes played Chelsea nil Arsenal nil in Baku yeah I mean now Zo is such an important role today it'd be great to see him on the ball because he has that you know like Hazard he's not quite the same in terms of taking players on but the way he passes the clinical style of his through pass it'd be great to see some moments from him and just then just showed a little flash this is the olympic stadium in Baku there is a running track around the pitch but they've covered it with a sort of a heavy green carpet and the two enormous Chelsea and Arsenal shirts that were displayed on the pitch as the teams came out they are now positioned behind the goal if you're sitting behind the goal you're quite a far away back from the action that the steepest and highest sides of this ground are along either edge of the pitch and at both ends there's three tiers there's actually six tiers on the far side from us including two tiers of corporate hospitality as Petticec clears straight down the middle of the pitch Obamian jumps doesn't get a clean touch on it Lackazette won't get there as Aspelikweta helps it back to Kaeper who's played in all but two of Chelsea's Premier League games this past season and all but two of their Europa League games on the way to this final as well Caviera was put in in that shenanigan after the the League Cup final of course here is David Louise 15 yards outside his own penalty area no great urgency impressed from Arsenal here until it comes to Aspelikweta then Kolasinac comes and powers into him but Chelsea weaved through that and then Koshelny does well to win it back in the midfield and here come Arsenal Lackazette receiving it looking up for Obamian that was good it was clever but he couldn't quite receive it Obamian and it skims through him and out for a Chelsea goal kick still 0-0 the nice contrast of styles there Chelsea almost worked a moment there to get through Arsenal's press but one they when he didn't quite come off Arsenal quick on the counter good turn from Lackazette and Obamian almost in almost Unai Emery hoping to become the fourth manager to win out of the old UEFA Cup or the current Europa League with two different teams Giovanni Trappatoni did it with Uve and Inter and Chelsea Mourinho did it with Porto and and Manchester United Rafa's done it with Valencia and Chelsea of course and Unai Emery hoping to join that through because down goes Olivier Giroux here just outside the Arsenal penalty area and he's managed to win a free kick and those cheers and whistles of the background coming from the Arsenal fans who felt that was a defile it was Laurent Koshelny who clattered into it well it's a great position for Chelsea I mean that's about three yards outside the 18-yard box so a great position for Hazard I could see him on the ball and got some big big targets in there with Louis and Giroux so big test here for Arsenal and particularly on Peter Check these are the moments that you'd like to test him early on Peter Check such a proud history and reputation of the game playing in his final match as a professional against his old club I would even hate to be involved in any sort of an error tonight as Hazard whips it in and it well what happened there there was a push in an Arsenal defender to Rara and absolutely no sweat at all to Arsenal they win themselves a free kick from what should have been a dangerous Chelsea position it immediately becomes a free kick for Arsenal a chance to clear away yeah I mean David Louise again yeah Louise just pushes to Rara over there and that's just ridiculous he does those kind of moments and so infuriating for Chelsea fans David Louise he dunked out of the header earlier he has these crazy moments but of course you know he comes with great quality in other areas he needs to just calm down a little yep you have to take the good with the bad of David Louise who's trying to play the hard man I think in the early stages here when he cladded into like a Zed and there when he bundled to rare out of the way but it's been wasteful for his team and now down the other end Arsenal are in Kolasinac first side good recovery by Aspelikweta and he puts it out for a corner just for a moment Arsenal look to have picked the lock there and Kolasinac inside the penalty area it was really good defending by Aspelikweta to get back yeah Petro kind of squitched off there and as Aspelikweta really did well as he's done the Chelsea many many times brilliant defending corner for Arsenal here it comes from the far side and cleared to the edge of the penalty area where Maitland Niles was lurking he couldn't get it down couldn't get into a position to shoot but it's back out to Kolasinac on the left hand side it's Jack in factor sends in across and it's deflected back away again and that goes out for an Arsenal throw in down near the corner flag they attack on the left hand side this is 5-5 for the BBC we're also live tonight in London on BBC Radio London we're live in Baku 16 minutes on the big stadium clock Chelsea Niles Arsenal nail the score Arsenal on the attack as the throw in is given to Montréal he sends it straight back to the half along with most of his teammates ahead of it and that what a waste that is as Koshelny puts it out of play what do you make of that Alan it wasn't his greatest pass but a good spell for Arsenal that was probably their best spell of the game so far it's nice and evenly poised at the moment the wingbacks have got in a couple of times for Arsenal down the sides and they've probably been the two best chances and you know an early cross down this right hand side and this left hand side as well so Chelsea just needs to be aware that central midfield players of the wingbacks getting in because the two wide players are hazard and Pedro they're just letting them go Nile Nile this stadium which will be used for games at Euro 2020 next summer that's a good header by Obamian Cape has got to come out challenges like a set also what a penalty referee is waiting and hesitating and I think he wants to hear what VA or have got to say about this lack of set went charging into the penalty area Cape came out and the referee for the moment is indicating that it's a gold kick I think he's indicating in the most tame way possible I think lack of set gets there first and then he's fouled by the goalkeeper the VA or officials are checking to see if it's a penalty I think they've got a strong case here but we've just been told the check is over they say no penalty well he wins it first the keeper actually catches him is probably debatable on what I've just seen on that replay but he definitely got there first and then he went over so wherever the dive was out was in no contact and he just dived after because he wasn't going to get it because I think it was running out of play so we'll have to see that again well very close it is further evidence that they are warming up Arsenal they're beginning to get in around the Chelsea defense Obamian's pass there was really good lack of set we know he's got the pace in the race head to head against Cape are running out towards me against the touch first down he goes but the VA or officials have decided that there was no foul by the goalkeeper and no resultant penalty but it's a scare a big scare for Chelsea wasn't that interesting with the referee didn't look like he made a decision at all it looked like he was I didn't even think he'd give a gold kick he was just hovering waiting for bar that is the problem when you have that system little nil in the Europa League final lack of set collects possession near the halfway line challenge this done by Andreas Christensen another foul given away by the Chelsea defense free kick to Arsenal on the halfway line Christian Sun who only played in eight Premier League games this campaign just finished has been a regular in this competition though in the Europa League and he falls back into a defensive position now as Chelsea pulled everyone apart from Sheree back behind the ball and I still take the free kick short to Shelley good ball into Mesut Erz and right channel the midfield midway inside the Chelsea half Maitland Niles is with him in support takes on Emerson goes around it Maitland Niles scoffed the cross a little bit but put out out off to a junior for a quarter quarter to Arsenal on the right hand side good spell from Arsenal and you know the use nice ball out from the back from Chris Chelney into the midfield and then the wing back got in again and that's the second time Maitland Niles he just won past Emerson and they've got a corner in a good position and a great spell nil nil the score line remains possession slightly in Chelsea's favour overall but Arsenal looking the more dangerous at the moment as Grannichakor comes across and he just picks something off the pitch there I don't know what it was he picks something as he was placing the ball here comes left foot across played in David Louise with a header away that was important and Aidan Azad continues that clearance on the edge of the penalty area good quarter by Shaka well dealt with by David Louise Terera has the centre circle to himself sprays out a lovely ball to Mesut Erzal who's picked up a position on the left wing support inside from Kolasinac driving but the offside flag is raised and that must have been for Erzal as the ball was played he was offside yeah just getting exploited Chelsea a little bit down the sides but a great header from Lewis from that corner because that was right where you want it if you're an attacking team right just inside that six yard box and it was a good defensive header one of these better moments in this game so far Chelsea playing in the Europa League for only the second time last time they played in this competition they won it that was in 2013 Sheru here wins a header and he was trying to cushion it down for Azad but he put too much on it and it goes out for an Arsenal throw Olivier Sheru who's not really been in the game so far certainly not in an attacking sense and Chelsea need to work out how they can get them out of us have been the joint top scorer in this competition so far how they can get him involved so far and maybe a chance to claim that top spot all to himself Jovic the Eintracht Frankfurt player is the other who's level with him here come Arsenal again like I said trying to surge forward good goalkeeping brave goalkeeping keeper Rietha Balaga came out I think he bundled into his team at Aspelicueta there and the goalkeeper is hurt Aspelicueta is down Rietha Balaga is down both Spaniards are going to be in need of some treatment here and again Arsenal getting in around the back of that Chelsea defense at the barge it's just the pace of the front too they're just causing them problems and he almost got that under control Lacazette and if he had you'd like to think he had scored there big collision between the goal in Aspelicueta but he's okay he'll be alright to continue so we're off from ready pulling his shirt by the way on the way through there certainly was yeah Aspelicueta was using all the dark arts of defending to try and keep Lacazette from from burning him with the the pace there as they both charged into the penalty area play is going to resume with a free kick to Chelsea just inside their penalty area taken by Kaeper and out towards Emerson who's immediately challenged by Maitland Niles and I think a feature that gave so far is that with the two Chelsea central defenders Christensen and Louise Havett there's no big press for Obamie Ang and Lacazette but as soon as the full backs get it Aspelicueta Emerson then the press comes Kalasenac and Maitland Niles putting pressure on those two so far in Golokante heavy pass very heavy too far in front of Aspelicueta goes out for an Arsenal throw and what should have been a routine clearance for Chelsea has now given Arsenal an attacking platform yeah I mean Arsenal are far the better side in this last 10 minutes and you're quite right and Maitland Niles down this side has been terrific just in this spell and he's causing a problem because Hazard's not tracking him so he's got the freedom and all credit to the manager to give him that freedom to let him go and run on. Here comes Monreal good bursting Rondamba left hand side and then fouled by Pedro and Chelsea are making a lot of fouls at the moment and I think it's testament to the pressure that Arsenal are putting on the Monreal just about to skip away from his compatriot and Pedro made sure he would go no further so a tactical fouling from Chelsea the spreading it around so no one individual looks at the guilty party so free kick to Arsenal they'll send plenty of bodies forward here Chelsea have got everyone back in around their penalty area they're holding a high line as well on the edge of the box good distribution here from Jaka and they could get into that corridor of uncertainty between the defenders and the goalkeeper the Swiss international stands and waits for the signal from the Italian referee there's the whistle here it comes in for Granicakha Kishelny missed it out comes Kaeper I think the last touch there off Socrates but it hit him rather than the other way around no shot at the end of it from Arsenal and their best chance so far remains that effort from Obamie Yang earlier on after Kaeper had punched it away into his path. Yeah it was just a bit shallow that free kick wanting to be just a little bit more on the back of that Chelsea line it was very very high and their Arsenal players ready to go but another chance for Arsenal you know the the creating chances they're making Chelsea play in their own half and turnovers Chelsea working hard in the midfield here Pedro wins possession that really got the way he skipped away from Lucas Terera now this is a test of a Golucatis fitness he runs he gets it into Olivier Chiroux tangled up in his feet he tried to pull it down with the instep of his left boot it hit his right boot he still nearly managed to get it under his control but for the first time in the game and it has taken 25 minutes for this to happen a counter attack from Chelsea and across that very nearly found Olivier Chiroux yeah and the centre backs were pulled around there once you do that when you commit to that press as Arsenal did then and a centre half's gone in then you're only one b1 in the middle where you're centre back and Chiroux jesting I'm not sure if he was trying to bring Pedro into the game there with a sort of clever backflip he had done better to get it under control but a good chance for Chelsea possession down the other end with the Chelsea goalkeeper the gap is clearance up towards the halfway line returns possession to Arsenal Chelsea Ndell Arsenal Niel here in Azerbaijan as the ball goes out of play off the knee of Matlin Niles and that returns possession back to Chelsea they take the throw in quickly Lucas Terera puts pressure on Kovacic it's a foul but play on to the referee oh and again in Golokate with a wayward pass whatever he had in his mind in reality there was no one over there he lashed it out to the far wing and the ball goes straight out of play for an Arsenal throw and they get on with it into Kishelny 15 yards outside his own penalty area short to Matlin Niles now a long ball which Obamie Angle capped her after down the right wing he picks it up he's got support as well Colasinac to the far post and he can pick him out here it is played in Lacazette flicks it up into the air and Chelsea breathe a sigh of relief as it comes down for Giorgio and a chance to clear away well if Obamie Angle had spotted Colasinac there he had an acre to himself on the far side here comes Lucas Terera trying to dribble his way into the penalty area too many blue shirted defenders in the way and Chelsea are able to get it away but only as far as Mesut Erzel just outside the Chelsea penalty area gives it out to Colasinac now back into Gradijakka be urged to shoot he does shoot and it's just over the top and the biggest ooo of the night from the crowd in Baku as the shot from Gradijakka is not that far over the top at all well the Arsenal causing Chelsea all sorts of problems particularly the front two they're running down the sides at a centre backs they got in again there great cross and it got cleared and then it come out and Jaby has a great hit I mean that is literally an inches over the bar fantastic hit which he he does possess and Chelsea just giving too much time there fantastic on the replay even clipped the bar at the end four goals from the Premier League this season for Gradijakka he scored for Switzerland during the international break in March as well against Denmark we know he can hit them from long range that's the first attempt he's had tonight but 28 minutes play Chelsea 0 Arsenal 0 here in Baku as Maitland Niles from a halfway line plays it over into space Colasinac sprints after it won't get their ball frustratingly for him bounces away and out for a throw into Chelsea Chelsea have absorbed a lot of pressure over the last 10 minutes or so yeah Chelsea Arsenal system is just dictating at the moment when you when you come out against these type of systems when you play free at the back you either dictate or you don't and they're dictating at the moment and that's great for the manager for sorry you'd be thinking hmm what's the way out now Chelsea's what I come on the counter attack here at Kova chat should push the ball ahead of him and try to chase after it Arsenal deal with it okay but Petticex clearance isn't great Eden Azar picks up possession here this room for Emerson in the penalty area shoots low blocked away by Stratas and it goes out for a quarter to Chelsea and his final is warming up and we're beginning to have chances at both ends yeah they just got they just got disheveled they are asked all sometimes they just got too many men going to the ball they got lost their shape and there was a chance there for Emerson the left back position worked nice to cut out by the centre back it's a corner one call for Chelsea at the pass for Emerson in the lead cup and he shot blocked out for this corner which is about to be taken by Eden Azar and he's got a very busy penalty area awaiting Giroud he's been man marked at the far side by Stratas and those two are squaring up to each other so much so that the Italian referee has to come over and have a word and say he's got his eyes on them here comes the corner played in by Azar David Louise tries to get the other front post good defending to get it away I think was Monreal who cleared Arsenal off into step up but they don't all step out together and they're quite fortunate Mesut Ozil had his wits about him to head it away there Chelsea Trio want to edge the penalty area it's played in by Azar the return pass though from Covichet is too firm and it goes out for a goal kick to Chelsea and to Pedecek away to our left hand side Chelsea nil Arsenal nil here in the Europa League final at the start of a very busy week on five live we have so much coming up tomorrow the start of the cricket world cup England against South Africa the oval every ball of every match live across the tournament on Friday will be live in Madrid will be counting down to Saturday's commentary of the Champions League final again in all English affair Liverpool against Tottenham and then in the early hours of Sunday morning you can hear exclusive commentary from New York of Anthony Joshua against Andy Ruiz for the heavyweight championship of the world so much live sport and big live sport coming up over the next few days on five live and one way or the other tonight we're going to get an English team winning the Europa League tonight in Baku for the moment nothing to choose between Chelsea and Arsenal on the scoreboard Emerson comes down the left hand side Chelsea have absorbed a lot of pressure but now they're beginning to apply some in Golokante midway inside the Arsenal half to the right hand side to his captain that's what they're going to step off it the right back shoots deflected off the heels of the defender I think it was Socrates and Arsenal were able to clear the ball away and then Chelsea fighting better for it in the midfield ensure that Arsenal don't fully get it away it goes out for a throw in for them on the far side I mean it's that you know you can't be more balanced this final at the moment you know the two systems have got their different strengths and Arsenal probably just got shading it at a moment but a chance for Arsenal there here comes Lacazette bit of room for him down the right hand side Emerson's trying to get close that's a clever ball back to the end of the penalty area Mizzard Erzel to Terera over into space for Colas and I shot the first time today he's had space in that wing and he's attempted cross come shot gets deflected out for a corner and the game has become end to end in the last five minutes it is it's a really good game I mean there's no it's apart from Cante probably you know not training I don't know for a week or so definitely having its effects tonight he looks a bit rusty he's given more away other than that everybody's on the game the thing we haven't mentioned so far is that for both European finals this week here tonight and in Madrid on Saturday they're doing it like the World Cup where you can name a 23 man squad it's not just the seven subs you would normally get in the Europa League or a Champions League game so there's an enormous number of players available on both benches here's the Arsenal quarter played in by Gratajakas so Kratus's header goes wide to the far post that wasn't the best marking from Chelsea so Kratus was given quite a bit of room but it goes wide yeah but he was just just did enough really bit of pressure from christiansen who's just enough to put him off if he hadn't put that pressure on him with about a chance there but again a number corner from Arsenal and progressing down these sides must be worrying for Sarri that Arsenal keep getting in down his sides of his team last on these sides met Chelsea lost that was two days on the Premier League in January Chelsea haven't lost back-to-back games against Arsenal since 2011 0-0 for now five live and BBC Radio London I'm sure many black cap drivers in the capital will be tuning in on one of those networks to us they may well know this but if you're a black cab driver in London you've got work in Azerbaijan if you ever wanted all the taxis over here are a London black cab taxis with one crucial difference Adam we know is the air condition is really good it needs to be given the heat here in Baku here come Chelsea Emerson into Giuggino that definitely played better now Chelsea here's Emerson gets to the end of the 1-2 shoot save by Pena Cek first important save of the man tipped to be Chelsea sporting director makes against Chelsea tonight as Azar tries to weave his way into the penalty area and is expertly dealt with by Ainsley Matlin as what a tackle that was to win the ball from Azar and to clear it away but then Incoli Cante catches um Galassana possession Incoli Cante's cross is weak and Arsenal managed to get it away but there's no doubt that this game has shifted up a gear or two with 12 minutes to go to half time Giuggino on the middle of the park gives it to Kovacic the noise here is good at the moment Emerson 10 yards outside the Arsenal penalty area to Eden Azar three Arsenal players come to surround him it's back to Kovacic nice flick by Olivier Giroud he does pick out Azar but Azar can't break away from the attentions of Socrates in front of him in the penalty area clever back heel from Azar Emerson's cross played in and despite the attempts of a flick from Olivier Giroud he couldn't flick his heel back behind him the player who uh not so like he scored that wonderful what's it called scorpion kicks not so long ago Olivier Giroud it was that it just wasn't high enough for that kind of a flick but he was trying to propel it from behind and all he could do was play it back to Pena Cek 34 minutes of the clock Chelsea and Arsenal now yeah I mean Hazard just had a few more moments there and for Chelsea that's if you can just get him in possession you can see he's scaring Arsenal to death but he just hasn't seen enough of it Arsenal dictated most of the game and that's how they want to continue just keep limiting his possession when he gets it he's a threat but Arsenal are throw him well nice from his result to go around Eden Azar and he wanted to play a one two with Obama Yang with a return pass was too firm Emerson does well under pressure from from Ozil both Ozil and Azar that the flair players if you like they're working hard they're telling me it's got that final atmosphere where nobody's putting in a out shift here uh they're making themselves available they're hungry to be on the ball as Torera has possession near the halfway line Arsenal playing from left to right as we looked out in there red shirts white shorts red socks and I amery on the edge of the technical area smart in the suit but it's your sorry a bit scruffier in the track he to his right hand side enormous technical areas here on what would normally be the running track of this Olympic stadium nil nil the score 10 minutes to halftime Arsenal in possession granted Jack 15 yards inside the Chelsea half support alongside him from Socrates who started more Europa League games this season than any other Arsenal player this is Lacazette back to goal on the edge of the penalty area to Ozil into granted Jack again the space for Kolasin as well as like close enough here comes the cross and Kepp is able to punch it away and it comes back into the penalty area and Gigno completes the clearance and then a showboating back heel volley from Eden Azar does nearly pick up Olivier Giroud mind you but Giselle he gets there first and it's cleared away but just for a moment Arsenal thought again space for Kolasin I mean just to explain it for Listerus at home Alan Aspen Aquinas been really well in the game but he's leaving gaps for Kolasin actually was coming on that overlap his wing back and finding space in the penalty area you know Pedro has to do more for me I mean Pedro is you know at the moment thinking he's not his job but I think halftime he's going to get a severe reminder of his manager because this is the massive problem that they're getting both wire players are not tracking the wing backs and so Chelsea are completely overloaded and that is causing them the most problems today if you're just joining our coverage on five live we have had a penalty appeal for Arsenal Lacazette went down VA or looked at it and said no penalty tonight the first time video assistant referee has ever been used in the Europa League and we've also had a shot from Obama Yang after Keppa punched it out towards him and he didn't quite catch it cleanly down the other end across from Gulloch and he picked out Olivier Giroud but he got it in a tangle between his legs and the only other real chance was was Everson's shot which was saved by Petr Cech time ticks on halftime looming in Baku good play by Chelsea as they work their way over the halfway line as on gives it back to Georgina Arsenal now working hard to get back into defensive positions as Aspelik-Quetta comes over the halfway line supporters of Chelsea find their voices Petros Kost into the penalty area manages to pick out Azard but his first touch was just a little bit off and he couldn't get it under his spell and Socrates clears away for Arsenal good clearance up to Lacazette who's foul and again this pattern of Chelsea when they feel they might be outnumbered they commit fouls in neutral areas it's no card but it's a telling off from the referee and a free kick to Arsenal still 0-0 Alan Bargeron. The best what Lacazette brings to the game you know is clever hold up play wait for the centre back to get too tight and then just took the ball in and drew the fouls clever centre forward play there but you know this is a nicely balanced game and in some respects even though we're a million miles away from England and London it's very much a Premier League game there's a nice tempo to the game. Here come Chelsea, Giorncinho in possession 15-20 yards inside the Arsenal half is there to be a goal before halftime. They've got a cante right hand side of the midfield Chelsea in danger of losing it here but Aspelik-Quetta is able to backpedal and he holds on to the ball supported by Christensen just inside it. It's a good work here there you know one touch stop in around the halfway line and Chelsea creating a little bit of space here. Chance, Giroux, head to the baller, shoot save by Petticec and cleared away by Montréal that's two big saves. Czech has made in the game now still 0-0. Well if everyone in an example of one touch midfield play that was it and they cut through Arsenal brilliantly there couple of nice just touches and Giroux has a clear chance right on the edge of the box left foot slightly scuffed still a very very good save by Petticec if he needed to prove anything tonight there to his manager he just did. Yeah it was a good reaction from the man who turned 37 this month getting down agile to his left hand side to push it away from danger as well but more danger might be coming because Chelsea have got themselves a corner and starting out to take it is Petro with a busy penalty area awaited. Petro and Azard standing over the corner now Arsenal with all 11 players back inside the penalty area to defend five minutes to half time corner is swung in stretching was Christensen couldn't get a touch. Georgina's got room on the edge of the box back in looking for Olivier Giroux does win the header down away from goal Petro tries to follow on and his volley is deflected away off and Arsenal defender Montréal and that goes out for a corner another corner to Chelsea who will remain on the attack for now they're trying to block there trying to free Louis up around the back he a couple of players just interfering with Arsenal players trying to get him free. Louis is a big threat from set plays particularly across that near post and he's gone again into that far post position to run across the near. Here comes the corner played by Eden Azard check comes and punches good goalkeeping picked up by Petro on the edge of the penalty area left hand side as Chelsea come forward clever ball into space for Angola Cante but his first touch isn't great and then he's got a retreat and gives it to Emerson as in the centre circle Arsenal being forced back at the moment and Golo Cante out to David Luis who's in a right wing position for some reason which is which is a very David Luis thing to be here he is again right hand side of the midfield picking up possession scrappy hair just easily drifting in the wind as he plays it in field towards the Arsenal penalty area that a foul is given away by Kovacic and Arsenal get another free kick and again no card Lucas Terraro was the player who was down How many it's hard to imagine why at 41 minutes we haven't had a yellow card yet in a European final because there's been enough fouls the referee's been quite tolerant I think it's from Italy so unusual for them they usually get the cards going they do yeah and Golo Cante flicks it over the top of Shack it tries to run around but he handles it then as he tries to control free kick to Arsenal bang on the halfway line Chelsea now Arsenal mill five live and BBC Radio London this game kicking off at 11 p.m local time in Baku so it's uh it's coming up to a quarter to midnight now christiansen wins the ball ahead of Lacazette and sets Chelsea in motion this is he did as on inside the centre circle it's got emerson making a good one outside it but he might need him here this is really good from as hard he shrugs off a couple of challenges now he gives it to emerson just inside the penalty area mate lanals is having a good game comes across and makes the challenge but offside flag was raised anyway against emerson and that will be a free kick to Arsenal and they'll clear their lines little nil it's strange really because you know well I think Chelsea they usually um have a lion's share of possession dictate the play dictate the play and have their moments tonight they're even though they've had a good share of possession they might even be edging it Arsenal look better in possession particularly in that last third where the two wing backs have got in Chelsea look better actually on the counter attack which you would expect it to have been the other way around tonight so that's just a slight difference in terms of what I was expecting Arsenal yet to have a shot on target in the match Chelsea have had a couple now where they've tested better check and he has stood up and made the saves last time Chelsea played in a Europa League final the winning goal came very late Branislav Ivanovich 93rd minute winner to win the Europa League might go all the way to the wire tonight extra time penalties if necessary to separate these London rivals as Socrattus as well here up against Covertich and clears the ball away but it goes out of play and that's going to be a throw into Chelsea left hand side as they come forward time ticks on 90 seconds of normal time remaining in this first half there'll be a little bit added on the stop which is as well Emerson prepares to take 10 yards inside the Arsenal half gets it back from Covertich now Covertich takes it on himself always don't matter if he can keep it in play and he doesn't a little bit like Ozilonio Arnibus scampering after it as it trickled along the white touch line book goes out of play for an Arsenal throw-in right full-back position for them so we were saying when you burst through like that you know it's running out of play but it's not running out faster than having you got to chase it down that's what happened there he knew it was going out I mean it's been a great first half I've really enjoyed it the goal action has been limited but some good chances and both managers will have different problems to deal with Arsenal who have shared the goals around in the Europa League this season they've had 12 different scorers in this competition not including own goals but so far they've yet to properly test Kepa the moment they're struggling to play it out of their own half for Bamyang with a touch into Lucas Terera who tries to return it over the top but it's cut out by Christensen Giroud knew he was coming back from an offside position so he doesn't challenge forward in the ball trickles out of play for a throw-in to Arsenal on the far side reminder will be live in Madrid building up to the Champions League final this weekend tomorrow the start of the cricket world cup every ball of every match live across the tournament on five live and five live sports extra. Arsenal's throw-in has been delayed and the reason for that is because the referee has decided there won't be anything added on for stoppages so they make their way towards the changing rooms all square nil nil both teams having created some chances but we await a break in the deadlock. Alibar, Geoff. Yeah I mean I feist the affair and I have to say some good quality on the pitch it's hard to say who has really got the upper hand here because I think it's so even slightly played out differently to what I expected but Arsenal have done really well I'd be really pleased if I was the Arsenal manager if I was the Chelsea manager I would definitely be concerned about the two win backs and I'll be talking to Hazard maybe to counteract that and Pedro just a wee bit more than they are. Hazard has shown a few glimpses Arsenal remember must win this final to get in the Champions League for next season for now in Baku at the break it's Chelsea nil Arsenal nil. Well your thoughts on 8505 885 live sport on social media Richard shame on those questioning Peter check and how much he cares he's saved us twice so far neat stop from Giroud there in the closing stages wasn't it Rob says you a for doing their bit for grassroots football by reproducing the atmosphere of park football in a major final I think I think our effects Mike is turned up to the max this evening Rob you might be right James that was a clear penalty for Arsenal even with the AR they've managed to get this wrong well let's go straight to Andy Townsend and Lee Dixon here in the studio with me on that you've had the benefit of the of replays it was a very swift decision Lee wasn't it yeah absolutely I think it was probably Vaar working at his best I did I thought at the time that the foot had gone in and it was a penalty I think Vaar I think just about got it right if that's possible with Vaar you know it's supposed to clear up everything it doesn't there's a couple of angles where there was a little bit of contact was there enough to bring him down etc I Andy I think Vaar got it just about right yeah the referee has always looked for the direction that the ball travels in those tight situations when you've got an on rushing goalkeeper trying to confront a striker the ball appeared that Lacazette had always made first contact with whether or not there was any contact really with Kepper I actually thought that that it was the right call there wasn't significant contact certainly from the angles that we saw here in the studio but but you're right Jonathan it was a very quick call there was no debate no no dilly dallying there they absolutely made that decision very very quickly okay tactics from the first half two things I want your views on one as Alan Padreau says that the room the space for the Arsenal wing backs Lee Maitland Niles on the right Clasinac on the left what more can Chelsea do to remove that space well a plane very narrow as we've seen and you know Azad and Pedro are not really coming back to help out the midfield so the midfields getting drawn into the to the centre of the pitch where Chelsea are protecting the back four and they're just getting hit down the sides and I think that's been their key weapon for Arsenal Alan was right the way that Clasinac has got in Maitland Niles are causing problems they've got the two up front so that's engaging the two centre backs the two full backs are going quite narrow as well because they're conscious about the two up front so they're trying to that four are trying to nullify the two and that's leaving the space down the sides I think Arsenal got it absolutely right but when you look at what Chelsea have done they've had the better chances yeah the one thing Lee I think that Maitland Niles and Clasinac have got to be better when they get in those areas where they're where they're exposing Chelsea a little bit the delivery into the box has got to be there you've got to make the most of that a couple of times we saw Maitland Niles just not quite stand it up we've seen Colisean actually take a touch when he could have hit things first time I think when you get in those areas and you and and you find yourself in good positions you've got to make the right call you've got to produce that bit of quality to really make it count but there was one moment wasn't there a beautiful ball through to Clasinac on the overlap yeah stayed on side he's down by the byline abamie and Lacazette are waiting for it six hour box yep and he takes a touch he takes a touch for the first time and you mentioned a name to me did I Andy Robertson with that dick oh it was Lee mentioned that and he's right who would have played that first time right yeah exactly would have just done done done it a little bit more quicker and more instinctively and it was the right thing to do doing it first time I think Arsenal played well played with good control in the first 20 minutes 25 minutes Chelsea have have looked a little bit menacing at times particularly when Azar gets on the ball and starts bumping in the people looking to get it back but but it's tight there's nothing much in this game and it again it's that those decisions I spoke about before the game not just without the ball with the ball at your feet making the right call to to provide an opportunity for someone might be the turning point here some more of your thoughts Adams and Chelsea fan no gameplay from us just random flicks losing possession less said about our defense the better hope we get lucky uh Anish says I'd love to see make the Niles playing as a winger next season when Bellerin comes back in um second tactical theme I'd like to just expand upon this this Arsenal press Alan Pardew great work from Jacques and from Terera and goodness me even Mesut Erzel what more can Chelsea do to to bypass that press because Arsenal are dominating that in that area aren't they yeah I mean um I think that uh Ozil when he's got on the ball has been very very good actually and um he's drifted into wide areas as well at times and of course that causes the center backs of Chelsea problems because he doubles up then with a wing back so you know Ozil has been very very good um I think Arsenal have been terrific actually and uh Chelsea ironically best moments probably have been on the counter attack thanks Adam we'll let you get a cup of tea or whatever you're offered there in in Baku as as a late night midnight feast um what what do you think guys on that I mean Terera has been impressive hasn't he yeah I think in order for Arsenal to win this game they've got to be good in midfield we they've got to stop that possession that Georgino we talked about before the game have they done that yeah they have and they've pressed him enough for him not to get easy ball out yeah and I think Cante you know to get the ball out to you know um Covertix for me is is a passenger in this midfield you know we haven't seen an awful lot of him and they're relying on Pedro and and Azar to just hit them on the break the worrying thing for Arsenal is the amount of shots they've had the amount of shots on target obviously is difference than the the difference because Chelsea have had a couple of shots Peter Cech's made a couple of decent saves one he should make the other one was a good save getting down as you really should have done better I think we talked about that me and Andy saying he didn't really get his shot away with a lot of power but it was a good save that's the worrying thing is Chelsea haven't really been in the game from a possession and tactics point of view but they've had the better chances well of lovely azard moments though on the edge of the box Andy tells it hasn't quite happened for him in terms of the final product but is there enough there from him to suggest that we could see something decisive in the next 45 from him at any given moment when he picks the ball up 30 yards out and he's got the ball at his feet and all of a sudden you see a wall of Arsenal players between him and the and the penalty spot and yet a couple of swift one-touch passes and he can find himself just a fraction away from getting a shot on target he's that good in those tight areas I think that again I think Unai Emery will be very pleased with the way that his Arsenal team have played but I think having been slightly better than Chelsea in that first 45 they've got to score first here I just get the feeling for Arsenal Lee I think if Chelsea score first I don't know why I just get the feeling that they might go on and get it done I think Arsenal have got to make it count whilst they're whilst they're enjoying good possession we've seen their press is good tonight Arsenal but they're notoriously bad when they get hit on the break when they've got possession they can get too many men forward and they can get me I'm out of goals last season we saw him get hit on the break like how does that happen you know you've got to see the danger before it comes and make sure you don't leave 1v1 at the back which they've been guilty of before if you leave 1v1 with Azar knocking about you're going to be in big trouble and you just feel as the game goes on Azar's going to have a little bit more of the important play and I mean that in the last in the last third second

F1 on 5 Live this is 5 Live Sport with Jonathan Overend alongside Lee Dixon and Andy Townsend here in the studio back to Connor McNamara and Alan Pardew inside the stadium in Baku very shortly Javel gets in touch 85058 neither side exhibiting best in Europe quality hope it's not the two weeks of inactivity that's to blame for the sake of Saturday coming what do we think about that I mean do we think that there has been a bit of a break here which has disrupted the momentum of these teams well you're always going to get that I mean I've been two weeks I know that the Arsenal have had a practice game behind closed doors so they've had a little bit of a run out whether that's competitively whether that's competitive enough going into a final not too sure I don't think it makes that much difference to be honest we don't think you need to be playing every three days in order to keep that up it's a final if you can't get up for this then you know pack your bags and go home I don't think it's been there I actually think the game has been has been has been tight but there's been moments both teams have showed a little bit of quality don't forgets an awful lot of states tremendous amount of state for both teams that we spoke pre-match here so it's you know it's not one that you're going to get either team just go and flying out the blocks all guns blazing literally from the first whistle look 10 minutes 15 minutes into this second period we'll start to see when a change or two is made when a when a team feels there's a moment perhaps for them that they can capitalize on we might start see the game pick up even more but I don't think it's been a disappointing game I think it's been what I expect I think Arsenal played particularly well and can't taste lasted when you know there were the doubts after what we saw in the warm-up and hearing his manager pre-match he obviously wasn't so sure he's been a bit sloppy in possession a couple of times he's not the greatest number eight in the world let's be honest he's he's fantastic at what he does but he's not he's not the most amazing forward player so but he's been okay and he looks he looks fit then he looks like he's gonna go through it yeah I think he's not his best but I think you can get away with doing what he's doing and these other players on that pitch that are going to win Chelsea this game it's not can't can't he'll do his job but they're looking at the the pointed end of the pitch with you know Pedro it and I'm on the break and obviously as I think as the game gets on and the you get a little bit tired in a final as well and the big comes a lot at stake towards in the last 20 minutes of this game one mistake and all of a sudden you see drifting away then it could get a little bit twitchy and that's when people would normally make mistakes when you get a bit nervous what about that point from Anisha read out just before the news about mate lanar's obviously when bellerine comes back in we would assume he is still Arsenal's number one choice on the right could you see a situation where he maybe shuffles his formation to accommodate both well he's done enough in that wing back position I still I don't think he's a right fullback personally I think he's a he can play wing back he can play midfield I don't think that's where he'll end up playing a lot of his football so he's his mate do has been brilliant because he has filled in that gap bellerine still needs a lot of coaching he needs a lot to learn about that right back position again very good going forward defensively I would question both of them as a right back as such they're both great wing backs but it's dependent as Andy said before we still don't know what Arsenal's best position is from the back four point of Euro back five they still keeps chopping and changing he does that to protect some certain players in positions Calasino he's not a left back so they play wing back so and I think they're still can't he's not sure and personnel in the summer who he signs in the summer personnel will decide what system they play long term and also on Chelsea I mean big summer ahead in terms of possible reshuffling Andy as the teams come out just a quick thought on on what may happen you know players are going to go they've got long-term injuries now as well correct big 45 minutes Jonathan now in for many many different reasons from for the manager for players moving forward for the club moving forward so it's a it's a significant 45 minutes certainly for both teams okay well nine o'clock here in the UK means that the clock is just ticking past midnight out in Baku in Azerbaijan and well it's nil nil we could still have extra time we could have penalties it's the Europa League final live on five live sport and here's the second half inside the stadium Alan Pardieu and Conor McNamara and still Chelsea now Arsenal nil for now just looking over some of the stats at halftime obama yang had the fewest touches of the ball of any player in the pitch just nine touches of the ball one of them was a shot that he skewed wide to the target no changes in personnel from either team over the break will get back underway with the same elevens that started this match it's late into the night in Baku we have passed midnight and here we go for the second half of this Europa League final Chelsea now playing from left to right as we look down in their blue shirts and shorts the white socks Arsenal in red Chelsea trying to get it up to Olivier Chirou but he can't make it stick on the edge of the area Terera does well to feed it away now a bit of room for Obamayang running with long strides making up an off-road across getting to the edge of the penalty area his cross deflects off the toes of David Louise not an intentional back pass and picked up by the goalkeeper Alan Pardieu well he's had more touches there probably than he did in the first half he had a run he had about seven touches but he just showed his pace there and again they're just down now in the signs of Chelsea's the worry Chelsea go long controlled down by Olivier Chirou five yards outside the Arsenal penalty area support behind from Pedro and the Arsenal defenders just for a moment stand off Pedro so he cuts in field on his right boot and gives it to Ingolecante 15-20 yards outside the Arsenal penalty area Pedro now picks it up on the right wing and there's a nice delicate touch from Eden Azard to encourage Aspelacueta forward good build up this from Chelsea Ingolecante back to Aspelacueta level with the edge of the penalty area right hand side as they come forward Arsenal have hardly had a touch since the game got back underway here's a chance for Ingolecante to cross he tries to run along the edge of the byline but well challenged by Jacca and the ball goes out for a goal kick to Arsenal and their goalkeeper Peracek away to our right hand side so a reminder of the teams Kevin Goldferre Chelsea back for Aspelacueta, Christensen, David Louise and Emerson in midfield, Giorgio Gigno is the anchor with Ingolecante and Covacic alongside him and then Pedro and Azard in support of Olivier Chirou up front Arsenal come over the halfway line with Colasinash forward to Mesut Erzl first touch was a bit heavy nearly gets through to Lacazette though David Louise back pedals wins ahead on the edge of his own penalty area and then Covacic down for the left back Emerson who clears it up towards the halfway line the Arsenal team check in goal three central offenders Socrates, Kishelny and Montréal make them miles and Colasinash with the wing backs then Jacque Terera and Ozil and then the top two Obamian and like I said here comes Chelsea on the counter attack good work to get to the edge of the penalty area Chirou's cross takes an affliction but it goes out I think for a corner and the referee has got two players on the ground to deal with here but Chelsea beginning to look more and more dangerous on this counter attack and they had plenty pace there as they almost created the chance for Chirou just stayed on side drew and as Aydan carried on his run he just went straight into one of the centre backs it wasn't a deliberate foul but Real certainly wasn't getting out of the way he made sure he stopped hazards going forward there but there's a corner for Chelsea and a good start by them a little bit a little bit livelier than perhaps they ended the first half just seeing a replay of that and Montréal certainly knows what he's doing blocking as are there his eyes are on him you could see where the collision was coming and he made sure as I would not be able to get on the end of a one-two here's the resultant corner taken by the Belgian terrible corner short right footed and clued away by the first defender who was Terera and Chelsea will remain on the attack with a throw in which has a hard threatens to take but I think he's going to leave it there says Eraspelakweta who started every Premier League game this past season for Chelsea it takes his time over this throwing just over 10 yards from the corner flag that Chelsea attacked down the right hand side Chelsea nil Arsenal nil in the wee hours in Baku header away by Montréal working hard for those Georgino gets it back for Chelsea Kovacic into a bit of space for Emerson five yards as of the penalty area President Zerouz diving header Olivia Zerouz scores against his old club he is now the standalone top scorer in the Europa League this season and once again it happens a player comes back to halt his former employers that was a killer header from Olivia Zerouz Chelsea won Arsenal nil four minutes played in the second half that was a textbook centre forward goal that the ball that comes in from the wide area is quite low and flat but he gets across the centre half and gives all he muster all his effort to get across him stoop low and bury that in the corner Peter check no chance that is a class goal from a striker who's banging form in terms of Europe in this competition for sure that is now 11 goals in 14 appearances in this competition Olivia Zerouz the World Cup winner the former Arsenal player has scored against his old club tonight and this is going to live and think something you had just mentioned at the part you have Chelsea came out with a renewed vigor at the start to the second half and they've been rewarded for it yeah a little stir from the manager maybe to sort of live and stuff up quick quicker pay get to the get to possession quicker and they certainly did and Arsenal just caught on their heels in that period and you know when you come out a half time as a manager you're wondering ever got the mood right free kick now to Arsenal so it's a game in which Arsenal were creating a lot of chances during a purple patch of the first half when they didn't score and now Chelsea who've been increasingly warming up and getting into the swing of things have broken the deadlock Olivia after 49 minutes free kick to Arsenal can they respond instantly jacket takes it wide from the left and a bad delivery there's a bit of a pinball machine off several players and then there's a push in a go to cad day and needlessly Arsenal have conceded a foul had a free kick to Chelsea that will relieve a lot of pressure and then we will be you know going over as a manager you stand on the sideline you see your team not start well second half and start picking your brains and did you get it right you know did you get the message right but Chelsea definitely have started the live here are the two teams and deserve their lead here we are on the shores of the Caspian Sea and Chelsea won the Lop in the Europa League final and that's at the moment that parade planned for Islington tomorrow is not going to be happening unless Arsenal could turn this around Chelsea in possession near the halfway line good work by Terera to win it back for Arsenal and then Joaquin your goes in strong and in go to cad day as well and chance of a counter attack here for Chelsea this is he didn't as hard weaving his way towards the edge of the Arsenal penalty area good work by Monreal to win that possession and now Arsenal will try and turn defense into attack as it is takes it over the halfway line pushes it in front of Obama Yang Arsenal have got a go for it now here's the cross too high for Lacazette and yeah the first half Colasalach had always gambled on making that run to the back post this time he doesn't the ball was played in that area but he was 30 40 yards back nearer to the halfway line and that was a fast break though I don't think really had a chance to get there to be fair but the Oyang is still the danger man really with that pace down that right flank and that's the side that Arsenal are going to have got down a couple of times in this half that's probably all of them Chelsea now got the noses in front they're very difficult when they're like this one nil to Chelsea the captain Aspelacueta takes the throw their goal scorer Olivia Giroux flicks it on all the talk about Petter check playing against his old club well it's it's another man who scored against his former teammates but it's over the deadlock here comes Eden as our good run twice around Socrates who did just enough as I had built up a foot head of steam there and the Greek defender was able to at least hold him up but Chelsea remain on the attack Pedro 15 yards outside the penalty area Chelsea enjoying themselves now playing it around with a bit more confidence Arsenal scrambling a little bit as Chelsea keep ball on the far side Kovacic back to the halfway line to David Louise it's incredible our goals change games but this has now become the Chelsea show as Angola can't a skips away from Montreal pushes it forward to Pedro Arsenal disoriented it cross comes in just too far in front of Olivier Giroux who sprints out tries to keep it in right by the corner flag it hits the stick but goes out in the end for a goal kick and Giroux has I think heard himself there stretching for the ball trying to keep it in play and he's slowly getting back up to his feet yeah he didn't look comfortable there did he when he went down he's holding his groin area and he's still holding it so you know a ball that was really gone to be honest he did well to just go and try and keep it in but he I'm just watching him recover there he looks okay Chelsea one Arsenal 0 5th live for the BBC and BBC Radio London tonight as Matlin Niles tries to get into a crossing position but he's matched all the way by Emerson good challenge now that ball goes out Arsenal will remain on the attack they have a throw in very close to the corner flag that they're attacking Arsenal be right to left in this second throw in from it nice towards Lacazette was a good one but Lacazette doesn't control it just to the moment these 10 minutes or so since half time not much is going Arsenal's way just seeing a repeat of the goal is a fantastic header I mean and that's going back in the annuals you're Andy Gray's and John Toshack's that goal fantastic and the goal scoring prowess of a little bit here she wrote this season out maybe cause it's a question how he's been used so sparingly in the Premier League as you know Marat at times it was a green being brought in she was very seldom being the first choice striker in the league and yet in this competition he keeps scoring here comes our song like a set into the penalty area does a full 360 degree swivel but can't bring the ball with it and Chelsea get it away Pedro is fouled as he clears fouled by Montréal all goes out for throw in now what's this oh no hang on so Pedro has said something to the referee he thought he was getting a free kick and when he didn't get it he's given some lip to the Italian official who does show the first yellow card of the evening to the former Barcelona man you don't agree with the talent disagree with Italian referee you're only going one way that result but you know it was interesting to see Pedro absolutely sprinting as hard as he could to get back with Verkal asnayac that time something he wasn't doing in the first half so that message has definitely got through Pedro the first man booked I remember commentating in a community shield a few seasons back when Pedro was sent off against Arsenal in that curtain raiser and at the end of this game obviously we've got the big one to come on on Saturday in the Champions League and then we start to drift our minds towards next season Premier League fixtures by the way are out on June 13th here comes Arsenal looking for a way back into this Europa League final in which they currently trail 1-0 as it ursil good body shape sends a low cross into the feet of a Bamiang who can't make it stick osil tries to send it further out this time but it's intercepted by Pedro Chelsea play it long good header by Kishelny Arsenal will come again room for Maitland Niles on the right hand side the two wing backs playing like wingers now really for Arsenal they have to go for this Kovacic battles for the ball and he gets the favour of the referee, Frinkik has given a Chelsea's favourite and a chance for them to just kill a bit of time here and settle things down. Yeah, awesome just need to settle down a little bit both the two sides and the banks joined in there left one on one I mean Jereau is not going to really embarrass you in that situation but that's you don't want to see that and I start chasing the game at this stage just playing me a time left for Arsenal to get back in this. So Olivier Jereau 11 goals in the Europa League this season it means he's the first player to score 11 goals in a European competition for an English club since Alan Shearer he got 11 in 2004-2005 for Newcastle United Jereau's goal separates the teams for now the assist from Emerson who's had a busy game on the left hand side of the Chelsea defence Arsenal have possession after midnight in Azerbaijan. Montréal 15 yards inside his own half under pressure from Pedro he's forced back and the body language is frustrated now from Arsenal how stretched arms from Montréal wanted better movement I think from Obamayang here comes Jacques over the halfway line helped forward to Maitland Niles he's got the front to Obamayang and Lacazette inside it gives it shorter though to Granajako tries to scoop it out to the near side received on the upper thigh by Kalasinac Montréal gets a touch helped out by Terera midway inside the Chelsea half Gigno's busy in there trying to suffocate the space for Arsenal here's a one-two between Maitland Niles and Lucas Terera the cross comes in it sits up for a moment and then a chance of a bicycle kick for Obamayang and a follow-up by Montréal three chances in one there for Arsenal but none of them target how the ball goes wide again down the sides of Chelsea getting in although Aidan Hazard and Pedro doing definitely more work down their sides they still managed to get in and Maitland Niles has been very effective down that side good chance gets a deflection up and wide before Obamayang can get an overhead kick in there's a good challenge from Christensen I think and stops him getting clean contact we have almost played an hour in Baku and Arsenal are yet to have a shot on target they trail Chelsea 1-0 the goal from Olivier Giroux on five live in BBC Radio London tonight similar cast as Pedro has possession for Chelsea more spring in their heels now Aspelac Quetta in field to Georgina lovely ball to Ingola Cante who's up in a right wing possession Terera comes out to try and keep tabs on him Ingola Cante who was the big injury worry in the 24 hours leading to the game for Chelsea his ball in field towards Azar was decent but Maitland Niles wins it off him and they play answers the referee as Chelsea get it back again this is a chance Georgina just outside the penalty area it's coverage swivels around now Azar into the box now Pedro it's 2-0 to Chelsea they double their lead Maitland Niles was caught in possession inside his own half had Chelsea have punished Arsenal Chelsea 2 Arsenal 0 Arsenal in big trouble now big trouble I mean Maitland there Miles I don't know if he takes a chance it looked like a foul to me but he ended up in right in the centre of the pitch with which left them short of the back a little one two a little bit of play Aino has it gets it down that left hand side and then he just picks out Pedro absolutely beautifully with a with just a really little label and then Pedro on his left foot scoops it cross the goal into the far corner great goal two goals at 10 minutes it was nil nil at halftime it is now Chelsea 2 Arsenal nil Chiroud at Pedro the goal scores and you have to say whatever Mauricio Sarri said at halftime his team have come out in a perfectly determined mood they have been so professional so ruthless almost in the second half in and giving themselves a huge advantage now absolutely and you know those comments Peter check made about you know that hunger and desire to win trophies you've certainly seen that from Chelsea at the start in the second half and Arsenal nil got a really dig deep really dig deep and then the shape they're in not take chances because they're getting exposed here so it's a real test for Arsenal to make sure that they go about this in the right manner yeah those comments telling referring to an interview the standard today with the peter check where he said that when he was in the Chelsea dressing room even if they drew a match it felt like the end of the world it was a real will to win he said things have been far more relaxed at his time at Arsenal look people were told don't worry about it if you don't win a match and there wasn't that pressure applied he said things are improving a bit under Unai Emery but that that intensity is not quite there as it was in his Chelsea days and maybe that's what we're seeing in this Europa League final which is now firmly in Chelsea's favour if Arsenal are going to come back and win this trophy they're going to have to do it the hard way mind you it's been a season of dramatic comebacks in European football so I'm not ruling anything out just yet we've a half an hour still to play in Baku never say never in Europe this year for sure but you know this is going to be a hell of a mountain to climb for Arsenal two nil down against this team Arsenal I think preparing a change down there there's certainly been a discussion between Unai Emery and some of his backroom staff for the moment it's the same players that start to the game Drana Jacka here from the halfway line plays a wonderful ball out onto the chest of Mesut Erzal on the far side this is where Arsenal need Mesut Erzal to step up now and provide a little bit of magic they need something special he runs across the goal from right to left well outside the penalty area gives it off to Monreal now granted Jacka chips forward chested down by Kolasinat crossing position on the left hand side but swarmed by Chelsea defenders and unable to find the space that would be needed to send in across Jacka again 20 yards outside the box plays a crossfield ball looking for Maitland Niles excellent tracking back really good that was from Eden Azar to get back there and win possession and now Chelsea lose it in the midfield again and Arsenal have no time to waste here two nil down in Azar by Jean Monreal that's really clever scooped it away in front of Georgina but he then loses it Monreal and fighting for his covetage in the midfield there's an obvious pull in his shirt referee says play on oh well they didn't play on Chelsea because they thought the free kick was coming it was such an obvious pull in the shirt I don't blame the referee there Alan I think he's he's helped out Chelsea as much as he can there but Azar didn't continue the run and ultimately Chelsea lost possession but they'll come again yeah I mean in you know just after which it would ragged at the moment I just think they need to they need sort of five minutes to get themselves together there's also sort of courage in the midfield where's my midfield you know and Chelsea really got a good grip on this game at the moment. Arsenal are preparing to make not one but two changes one of them is Wobby the other Guendouzi here's a good run Covertich gets right to the edge of the penalty area challenged by Kishelny taken off him by Pedro Pedro de Chiroux who goes down well he goes down very dramatically and the referee points to the spot and Chelsea unless VA or get involved have got themselves a penalty here it was another slick slick build up from Chelsea who were proving to be headed shoulders better than their opponents in the second half. Giroud just as the ball came to him went down like a ton of breaks and the referee hardly hesitated pointing to the spot a penalty to Chelsea a chance to get a three goal lead. It's I mean Pedro drives across the box lays into Gerard Giroud's path and make the miles really has been quite naive really he's come in the back of him and put a shoulder into his back and unfortunately that's a straight decision and I'm just looking at the manager of Arsenal he knows. So this can probably settle it then with 25 minutes to go. Eden Azard in what could be his final game for Chelsea a penalty against Petricek in Baku and he sends it straight down the middle of scores. Chelsea three Arsenal nil if the Europa League trophy had handles they might well be putting the ribbon on them now. 3-0 in Baku Giroud, Pedro Azard and all the goals have come in the 20 minutes since half time. I mean Chelsea you've just gone up a gear I mean that's all you can say really but they might have even gone up two gears from where they were because this second half just been about them they've just been more clinical strong got faster they've moved the ball quicker and they're two offensive players Azard and Kovacic had a brilliant run there they've just gone and just drove at Arsenal's midfield. Maitland Miles you've got to feel for him young boy like that making that error that's a that's a costly error and now Arsenal made the two subs I've not seen who's gone did you see come up. Monreal has gone off, Gwendozzi has come into the midfield and Wobby's about to make his introduction they wanted to make this change before the third goal this smacks of the horse having bolted and people looking at the fence and wondering can we close the gate. Monreal was the first it goes off and now it's going to be Lucas Terera so two changes for Arsenal but they need three goals and in the mood that Chelsea are in it seems highly unlikely that they're going to get them what Arsenal need to ensure now is that this doesn't become embarrassing because 16 minutes are they get between those three goals from the moment Giroud scored with Pedros in the middle and then Azard's penalty and just like that in those 16 minutes Arsenal's Europa League dream appears to have absolutely crumbled away from their grasp. You know one of Arsenal's problems was when they went one down they was chasing the game it didn't need to do that whether that's the naivety of some of the players in the group not been at this level before I don't know but Chelsea just picked them off and you know the free gold league probably flatters them slightly but that's what it is. So Arsenal back to a back four, Pedro in possession for Chelsea they're enjoying it now spraying the ball around a three goal cushion here and it's all turned so quickly against Tuna Emery a man who was hoping to win this competition for the fourth time but his Midas touch appears to have come up a little bit short. Nicola Cante challenging Guendouzi here. Guendouzi fresh onto the field as a substitute Arsenal in possession but they're back on the edge of their own penalty area. Yeah they've really got to sort of find a route back in somehow and that will help. And Wobby just skipping past as we were checking they always skip past. Wobby was not there by Christian Sinner, he's got to go in the book as well. That was a cheeky trip. Christian Sin knew he'd been bamboozled by the swing of the hips by Wobby. He raised his leg as a Wobby went over him and tripped him rather blatantly. Yellow card has been shown. Yeah so as we've got absolutely roasted there and that's what Arsenal need. They did that individual flair in between some of their good team play. Take someone on try and create something try and get back in this game. And there's a there's another set play which I think they've been poor at tonight Arsenal. That delivery was to go right in that area between the Chelsea back line and the goalie. Jack to take the free kick wide on the left. Swings at a left foot had better delivery this time but David Louise gets up and heads it away. It's going to fall here for... Obama young at the far side. Wobby! What about that? Just on the pitch! Drills in a half volley! Unstoppable for Kaper. Arsenal have got one back. They need two more but in this season of crazy comebacks they've got a quarter of the game remaining to try and worry Chelsea. Three one four goals all in this second half. There's a corner it gets cleared it comes to the edge of the box it sits up absolutely beautifully for him but he's still got a lot to do. He gets a great connection and actually calls it with the outside to be sported to that far post. That's a great goal. What a what a live for Arsenal that is as the game was running away from them they're right back in it and as we say with all of everything that's happened in Europe this week that will be in Chelsea's mind for sure. Three one four goals at 20 minutes. Sherwood, Petro and Azad for Chelsea. It will be trying to keep things interesting from an Arsenal point of view but if they could go and grab another one it will be interesting. Us for sure. Two goal deficit will feel a lot better to win iMRI's team than the three goals they were facing just a moment ago. By the way that Eden Azad penalty means that his tally for the season in all competitions moves to 20 goals. It's the first time he's ever reached 20 goals in a season for Chelsea. They may be about to lose him but it's been the highest scoring campaign of his career at the club. How are they going to replace those goals next season? Here is Inko Lokante halfway line. Chelsea preparing to bring on William. They want fresh legs. Sherwood's going to run here but I don't think he'll keep it in play. We'll eat no it goes out. It goes out for a corner corner to Chelsea who just want to calm things down now. They've got a three one lead. They want to make sure Arsenal don't make it any closer. Well you know when you're a manager and you're putting on substitutes you want an impact. You say to yourself come on you know give us the lift and my goodness Mia Wobbe has done that. He's done that great bit of skill and took two players on one the free kick and then from that result in there's a corner and then he's goes and smashes it in the corner. So brilliant for him but you know that goal just lifts so many players. I'm looking at Maile Lamarles. He looked like he was really suffering after giving that a penalty away and now he's got a little spring in his step again so it's such a lift and the game now is poised a little bit better. Corner taken short. Williams just come on. Rolls it to Azard and Gullochante with the cross. Header at the far post was by Olivier Giroud who feels that he was sure it was being held on to, that he was being fouled by Socrates but the referee says it's okay. Had play continues. William by the way came on in place of Pedro. Pedro who scores it in all English final again. Here they come. Chelsea into the piliers. Azard gets it back from Giroud scores. Four-one. What a second half it's been. It's Chelsea's night though once again. Four-one. Second goal of the evening for Azard. Arsenal's defense all over the place. Well they get themselves back in the game. They make another mistake on that right-hand side. Azard gets the turnover. Little run puts Giroud in and the Giroud's pass back is absolutely exquisite. Here we just showing the replay now. Azard drives it to the defense. Giroud just drifts left and then he thinks it over the centre half. Azard calls it a side-four. Four-one. Well they've pretty much averaged to call every five minutes since half time. What about this? Chelsea four. Arsenal won. It will be a score the best goal of the night but as things stand it's only going to be a scant consolation for an Arsenal team who've not really got their illustrious front through of Aubameyang and Lacazette into the match and their weak spot if you like. Their defense has looked uncertain, has left gaps and has allowed Chelsea to score for a fourth time now. It's just what I say the build up to the goal. About Pedro scoring in an all English final again. He scored in the Champions League final against Manchester United in the past as ball is played back to Socrates. Ten yards outside the Arsenal penalty. What do they do now? And just when they felt okay maybe just maybe with a chance at three-one four-one it must be so demoralised. And on a turnover as well they was in possession. I mean how ironic that Aydans now on a hat trick you know it was only ten minutes ago that he hadn't scored so it just goes to show you how the quickness game can change but Chelsea you know to say they got the hands on the trophy really and surely now and Arsenal very very difficult to find a route back when you can you score and give you that lift and then to concede straight away is a is a terrible blow for them. Five lives from the BBC and BBC Radio London tonight live in Baku the capital of Azerbaijan. And we've had five goals tonight in this Europa League final four of them for Chelsea who were on the verge of winning the Europa League for the second time. This Mendoza makes a very deliberate and obvious foul on the half-way line on Georginho and that is a free kick to Chelsea who are just completely in control now once again. I mean I find it strange that we haven't had more yellow cards. You know I'm looking at this game that's such an obvious yellow card that you would get in the Premier League and yet again it's I don't know if you just had the one book in two I think. Pedro and Christensen both Chelsea players but it's Chelsea on the verge of winning this Europa League final. Georginho back to Christensen all the way back to the goalkeeper once again. So first season in England for Mauricio Sarri he appears to be about to win a trophy for the first time in his managerial career and led Chelsea to third place in the Premier League when you consider the high standard achieved for the top two. There's no great shot, that's a lovely touch by Hazel the far side. Now into Olivier Giroud. Now the low shot saved away by Petitcek and Chelsea are going for it now. They want to humiliate Arsenal, they want five and most notably Eden Azard wants a hat trick. It's absolutely brilliant. He's you know he's tails up. Here comes Obamayang into the penalty area down the other end takes it wide around David Luiz and blazes it high up and over the crossbar. Sorry Adam. Obamayang has been poor this second half and those moments of quality but Eden nearly got his hat trick there. Great save from Petitcek. They needed Petitcek tonight. I mean you know he's made three or four fine saves and still finds himself four one down. You know he can't hardly believe it I should imagine but Chelsea have been terrific second half. I mean they've just been a level above. Yeah I think if you weren't in tune with this game, if you just saw the score line afterwards you'd think oh dear poor old Petitcek what a way to bow out and it is sad for him personally. It's not in any way beaten his fault. None of the goals you could point towards the the goalkeeper playing against his old team for making the mistake. There's a little change happening here. Ross Barclay is being introduced and he will come on in place of Kovačić. It's almost a joke amongst Chelsea fans so those two always seem to replace each other but the 12th appearance of this Europa League campaign. For Ross Barclay scored home and away against Malmo and he comes on. Fresh legs into the midfield for the last 15 minutes. It feels like the outcome of this final though is already decided. Chelsea four Arsenal one, Giorgio on the halfway line. No opponent within 10 yards or in any direction. Back out to the left hand side to Emerson. Now in Golokate who would look and appear is about to see out the full 90 minutes after all that talk about injury concerns. He's passed the ball forward. William was fouled and the Golokate sprints after it himself but I tell you he nearly gets there. I've always had this theory you know when he's fully fit there's actually two in Golokates. He makes his present felt so much on the pitch but on this occasion it's out for a goal kick and possession back. The guy can confirm that as the opposing manager. There's definitely two of him for sure. But he's been terrific second half and you know it's so ironic isn't it. We're all talking before the game about Sarri Fronis cap and you know Badfielder in Chelsea and his cantony, Fiat etc. etc. Well the scoreline 4-1. Just goes to show you you media boys you can't read anything into that. Sometimes some of its gloating daggers sometimes is put on for show you know and for sure. I don't think Kanti was anywhere in doubt from what I've seen of him tonight. Right another change for Arsenal. A very despondent looking mezzed Uzzel makes way and his teenager Joe Willick comes on. He's played a couple of times in the Premier League in recent months. Scored in the Europa League back in November. He is on some fresh legs down the left hand side of it up here. He's the left hand side of attack. Obamian on the right and Lacazette through the middle but Arsenal in need of a Baku miracle here with 12 minutes or so remaining in the game. Chelsea 4 Arsenal 1 Alex Obobi who came on as a sub at 3-0 down. You'd only been on the pitch for two minutes. Scored a brilliant goal and we thought here we go. Maybe just maybe game on but down the other end Chelsea came and that goal from Azard restores their three goal lead and the feeling of dominance that they've got in this game. Azard who scores two goals in the final of the European competition. He's the first player for an English club to score twice in UEFA competition final since Mark Hughes. Here comes Joe Willick into the penalty area twice to shoot good defending by David Louise. Makes the block in the penalty area and gets it away. Mark Hughes, Manchester United against Barcelona, 1991 Cop Winters Cup. Here comes Chelsea down the other end. William to the edge of the penalty area goes to Rakesh Ali. Shoot and save by Petticec. Well he's by far made the most saves of the two goalkeepers. He pushes that out for a Chelsea corner. I think Peter Czech will be looking at his back four here saying you know guys come on give me a bit of cover here. He's had to make another great save there. He must have made three. They switched off again here Arsenal. Chelsea are in. The corner is taken shortly. Willi and slips in the penalty area and that goes out for a goal kick to Arsenal. The clock ticks on just over 10 minutes of the regulation time to go. It feels highly unlikely we're going to have extra time and penalties now. Chelsea who have got the job done in the second half after withstanding a lot of pressure during the first period. But for all that pressure Arsenal didn't produce a shot and target. I think that will be the regret, the biggest regret for their supporters who've travelled here. This enormous journey. 5,000 miles return journey at Tupacou and their team toothless in front of goal and not able to trouble Chelsea at all in that regard. Here's Ross Barkley. Really nice touch from Hazard to find in. Hazard is hungry for that hat-trick. Willi and comes through the middle. Barkley again back to Willi and fresh legs. Sucrose comes running across. The shot is deflected and it goes out for a corner to Chelsea who are threatening to run away with this if they haven't indeed already. Well Barkley had two choices there. He had William down the run. He had Aydan Hazard from the hat-trick down the left hand side and he went to William and he does look to him as if he's saying come on. But you know Arsenal, the preview of this game was Arsenal's defence. Would it hold out? Would it be able to cope with Hazard? Unfortunately it hasn't. So it will appear no Champions League football for Arsenal next season. William takes the corner short to Aydan Hazard. Behind him is Aspelik-Quetta. And now Hazard wriggles his way into the penalty area. It gives it back to Aspelik-Quetta. The angle is tight but the shot was only a whisk away. That was so close to a fifth goal for Chelsea at this final. Aspelik-Quetta, I love that. I mean he's been Chelsea's outstanding defender for 10 years or whatever it is. He's been brilliant and that would have really capped it off but Chelsea are absolutely dominant at the moment. Aspelik-Quetta who got his first score of the season not so long ago actually against Brighton. Here comes a Wobby for Arsenal. Surely it's done and dusted though. Gwendouzi in the midfield. When he looks back at his tactics tonight, Unai Emery, do you think you'll regret the three central defenders? Was that too negative or did he need that firm base given their defensive record? Well I thought the system worked well in the first half to be honest. I think it probably just had the upper hand. But when it came out second half, Sarri was a bit braver. The two wide players started doing their job for a bit more aggressive in the defensive work and they got turnovers and from then turnovers they've come the goals. But after the first goal, definitely Arsenal went down a level and Chelsea went up a level and that's how it stayed more or less the whole of the second half. Arsenal attacked down the right. Obamian Lash has won in and it goes for an Arsenal corner and in the turn our strain of little Gianfranco Zola who'll be savoring this means long association with Chelsea over the years. About to lift more silverware it would appear. Just over eight minutes to play a Wobby who's already scored once. This time he dinks it in. That's a clever ball and a chance to control and like I said, can't score and Obamian tries and he can't score either. And with the goalkeeper flailing all over the place, do you know what? It wouldn't have counted anyway. Flag was raised on the far side. Chelsea's defenders celebrate as if they've scored a goal themselves. Look down there, little pats at the bottom and high fives in the hall works and it's just not been Arsenal's night. Well, Chelsea come out there and four Arsenal players looked offside but ironically the player it fell to was onside. A brilliant save by Catherine and then on the rebound. Even though he was offside, Christensen got a great block in. Chelsea's defensive duties have been much, much better in this game than the Arsenal back four, five. Again, strong waft of the smell of oil that you get here in Azerbaijan. This Petrodollar State and very much the smell of the local industry and where all the money is coming from in the air as Chelsea come forward but an interception by Kishelny and a chance to clear away. Bamiyang is deep inside his own half of the moment. Now Granada Jack is still midway inside the Arsenal half and Chelsea just enjoying it now, jogging across, trying to keep times on Alex O'Wobe who comes over the halfway line, picks out Willock. Good play to give it to Lacazette. Back to Willock! Oh, so close! He puts it shot wide but that would have been a beauty for the teenager. How unlucky after O'Wobe and Lacazette aided him perfectly in the build-up. Well, they made the last eight minutes interesting as well. It was a brilliant play and now he's just trying to put too much on that. He hasn't got his foot quite round and he's just gone outside the far post but his play before them was absolutely brilliant. Both the subs have done terrific since they come on in the team that in the other nine areas have got their head down a little bit. Not just going to be made tomorrow. I'm sure there'll be pictures showing some empty seats at either end of this stadium. One thing to point out, if you look at the top of the very bottom tier here, I think a lot of supporters have left seats at either end because the concourse allows you to walk around and stand at the back and you get a halfway line view because behind the goal with the running track you're very far away. So although, you know, absolutely this isn't a completely sellout tonight, I think there's more people here than the empty seats revealed because there's thousands of them standing at the back of those tiers all the way along the side. Obviously we can't see the stand we're in but I'd imagine it's a similar aspect there. Arsenal not enjoying their night here for one down against Chelsea. This all London Europa League final very one-sided after a second half performance from Chelsea that has just blown Arsenal away. Here is a wobby left hand side. Chelsea pulling lots of defenders back deep. Hesitation by Jacque waiting for the challenge to come which does throw Olivier Giroud and the referee gives Arsenal a free kick at what? Oh for a moment I thought might have been a shooting position but actually the referee's taken a step or two further back from there to put his referee spray out and that those extra couple of yards have made this a very long range prospect if Arsenal decided they wanted a goal for goal but like I said Mike just be considering that desperate times lead to desperate measures. Yeah but you know it probably is in his range jest and that's about 28 yards 30 yards that's a hell of an effort. I will be worked too worried if I was the Chelsea manager in this situation but you know the goal now with the sort of history we've had in Europe this season. Like I said is the only Arsenal player standing over this there's no decoy runners there's a wall built in front of him like I said hits it but hits it high and wide he gave it a good lash but it's off target four minutes to play Chelsea for Arsenal one. And is that still there that would they have an under shot and target Arsenal because that wouldn't be something you want to walk away from a final with there's a stat against you. It hasn't cost them the game by the way the back defenders have but Chelsea for sure here seeing the time out now 86 minutes. And in those 86 minutes Arsenal have only had two attempts on target. Clear and spy Kepa up over the halfway line straight to Socrates who wins the header for Arsenal. Latelyn Niles still with energy in his legs comes over the halfway line right hand side Ross Barkley puts pressure on Obamiak. Arsenal hold on to possession Gwendozzi and to Granadjakka out to Obamiak on the left hand side that's really well done for Kalasadu tries to cross and blocked away by Christensen. Now you mentioned on the project that the substitutes have done well they really have done for Arsenal actually. Obamiak has been a live wire since coming on Gwendozzi has been full of running. Here is Obamiak tries to flick it back to Gwendozzi into the penalty area wants to try and control it harder said than done. Chelsea regain possession and they'll clear it away with Azard in that left full back position helped out by Emerson Gwendozzi battles out and wins it back again. He's fighting on for sure into the penalty area they come Arsenal but good work back there from Giorgio Gigno. Chelsea will come away with the ball and in the end with a Chelsea player down in Golochante plays another field so his team it can receive some treatment two and a half minutes to go. No doubt about it now Chelsea are about to win the Europa League. Yeah I'm fairly deserved mainly on the second half we've got a substitution now I'm not sure who's that's going to be as the Chelsea substitution. Azard's going off and Zapacosta is going to come on to stretch his legs right at the very end so there won't be a Europa League final. Hattrick, Frieden, Azard is this to be his last appearance for the club. Chelsea fans will certainly once they realise it's him going off they're going to give a standing ovation I'm sure. Tonight Eden Azard's 60th game of the season for club and country he brings his goal tally to 21 goals for Chelsea the most he's ever scored in a single season of the club. Well if it is a way to bow out it's not a bad one Alibarju. He could feel he's been a very good surfer for the club over the years. Absolutely he's been brilliant for Chelsea but in the second half today he was almost on player out there on that left hand side he's created and scored and his job is done and they'll be looking forward to you know getting hold of that trophy and fairly deserved too. Is that a difference between the two teams that that Chelsea have a standout performer whereas Arsenal there's no one individual who you would say yeah he's been their best player tonight. Well you know we've got a well cut winner in Ozu out there who didn't produce tonight nowhere near the level of Eden so you know they have got those players and they have got those players but defensively today own half breakdowns a bit of naivety here and there and the goals of hurt them too and that's why we stand at this small. Right all over Bar the shouting we're into the final minute of normal time a banner has been unfurled up midway through the enormous stand on the far side it's a message from Azerbaijan it says that we are all part of football thanks to UEFA for the final. They know that there's been doom and gloom about the the decision to have the final here particularly when two English clubs were drawn and they knew it's such a long arduous expensive journey they know there's been criticism of that and I think that banner is sort of saying well look we are all part of football it's not just the elite nations we're so thrilled to have hosted this final and they've got to see five goals as well as Willock attacks down the left hand side he's done well but he can't get the shot through and Targeter wins a corner Chelsea defending resolutely to the enemy the only goal Arsenal have got was a worldy from distance Arsenal haven't looked like scoring from close range in the game. Willian miscontrols here but Ngola Cante is in to clear it away and he does see out the 90 minutes in Gola Cante as we move into stoppage time of which there are three being added on the manner was the big injury doubt Ngola Cante is about to win another medal well cupwriters medal a year ago and if I was a betting man I bet he covers more distance than anybody else and he almost can guarantee it which would say everything wouldn't it won the league with Leicester won the league with Chelsea he's won a world cup with France and now we're about to add the Europa League and Gola Cante as Alex O'Wobe battles on down the left hand side for Arsenal plays a one-two thinks about a shot on the edge of the penalty area saw a lovely cross in front of Bami Ang and he can't score he muffles his shot what a chance and that if nothing else that sums up Arsenal's miserable night that was laid on a plate for a Bami Ang and he just couldn't apply the finish yeah that was great play by O'Wobe again he gets it in the left hand channel thinks it would be right for it sets out beautifully and unfortunately for O'Wobe he's had one of those nights tonight he hasn't really struck the ball well and his final pass has been poor the repercussions of this are going to reverberate for Arsenal it's not just the disappointment of losing a one-off final it's not just the wait for a european trophy to continue the wait for a first trophy of the post-venger era it's going to mean no champions league football and that's going to be difficult and attracting the players that they clearly do need if they're to get into the top four next season I think if you as an Arsenal fan you know you know that the manager's good enough there's no doubt about that you know and he you know you look at this team and they just don't look good enough really individually for for the quality that Arsenal need and they have they have players in certain areas but in certain areas they look weak but you know there is a there is a good future here with his manager and a lot of young players at Arsenal that are coming through but that extra money the champions league as you say would have just propelled them up much quicker here comes Arsenal Joe Willough get into the penalty area shoots from the edge of the penalty area and it goes wide but uh just be pointed out to one of the one of the comments of the BBC at Tech's commentary toby texted it to say Willough still more in 10 minutes than Ozil did all game and I think he's right that's not actually an exaggeration that is true Chelsea on the verge isn't it incredible 24 hours ago I was sat alongside you while we were talking about the shambolic scenes at our Chelsea's training session here last night Sarri leaving the pitch throwing his cap kicking things it looked like players were fighting amongst each other a day is a long time in football and they're about to celebrate together and and Sarri what a moment for him about to lift his his first ever piece of silverware as a coach it must be you must be so proud because it's so difficult to win trophies and you know this is a this is a way to win it there will be crosses from the left for Arsenal Lacazette shoots blocked away by David Louise he doesn't want Arsenal to score another one Lacazette goes down that's not going to be a penalty Zappacostra wants clear and there it is the final whistle in Baku goes at 10 to 1 in the morning local time it confirms a 4-1 victory for Chelsea from Maurizio Sarri third place finish of the Premier League higher than Antonio Conte did last year in terms of points and he's got himself some silverware and Arsenal's trophy parade and Islington tomorrow has just been abruptly cancelled Sherude and Pedro and two from Eden Azard in what might be his final appearance for the club and you've got to say in that second half Chelsea were really really good yeah they as a team they were they were just faster and quicker and part in the small crisp and of course with the outstanding individual on the pitch, Eden Azard he was terrific second half he was quite quiet actually in moments in the first but he really come alive in the second half and all those moments all those goals he was part of a great performance from Chelsea I thought Arsenal were good first half and unfortunately for them the game got away from them and their reaction to the goals would probably be a bigger concern than anything the goals went in quite easily at that that period and the game was gone but you know they still have a lot of great young players and a great manager and they'll come next year and hopefully be pushing for that Champions League place again. Joy for Olivia Sherude scoring against his old team the two goals from Azard will get headlines as well final score in Baku Chelsea win the Europa League they beat Arsenal 4-1 and the next live football is Saturday night live from Madrid here on Five Live Sport the whole of Tottenham Liverpool the Champions League final but we're with you tonight through until half past 10 for all the reaction for the moment Chelsea lift their third major title the third different major title it has to be said in the last three seasons Premier League two seasons ago FA Cup last season under Conte and now under Surrey the Europa League and congratulations to Chelsea for a scintillating second half and Andy Townsend, Eran Hazard as we suspect he might turn the game and won it for Chelsea. Well he did as Alan Padu quite rightly said in commentary that second half they played at a different beat a different tempo to what they've been playing in the first half there was more energy about them what we saw from Arsenal in the first half we liked but ultimately that was pretty much all they had to offer and I just always had a gut feeling that first goal this evening if it went Chelsea's way Lee and I spoke about it half time I didn't see Arsenal somehow clawing their way back and and they were there were some good goals in there from a Chelsea point of view there was some sloppy casual defensive work as well from Arsenal in that respect the best team won on the night the key player stepped up and again fitting for Aiden Hazard that he should score a couple on what is probably his last game. Just looking at the monitors Chelsea's name is being engraved on the Europa League trophy a shot of Mesut Erzel sitting leaning back in the dugout not bothering to go out there on the pitch to either console his teammates or indeed congratulate the Chelsea players I'm going to turn to Lee Dixon before we lavish more praise on Chelsea because that has to be done this evening and Maurizio Sarri I mean after an extraordinary season that he has endured a first season in English football he leaves having helped Chelsea to third in the Premier League guaranteed Champions League football and the Europa League title but Lee from an Arsenal point of view what do you make of what you've just seen well I think Alan was right he played played well in the first off didn't have a shot on target that was one of the problems started to look like they were just giving a little Chelsea a little bit of space and then setting after we're blown away this team to be honest with you it needs to be playing well it needs things to be going its way when the things don't go its way it falls a little bit we saw that at the end of the season the character of the side the team spirit is talked about it's good it's this it's that I don't see that when they go down I really don't I think the fight isn't there the organisation are they getting everything from the manager are they understanding what he wants from them because they don't look any different to me without the ball than they did when he took over there's a little bit more organisation but the actual the press in the first half was decent so you go okay as soon as they go behind the defense the defensive mistakes they make the first goal was imperative that you get that goal in a final as Andy said Koshelny's mistake for the goals a brilliant header from Giroud really great cross brilliant header should not have a chance to make a header like that you've got three centre backs there's a centre half you've got to be in front of Giroud you know he wants to make a near post run it's his game that's you know your player know the player's going to make that run stand in front of him it gets bit you get beat over your head that's fine but the organisation defensively without the ball at times is knowing no better than it was before emory get there but huge recruitment problem they've got in the summer they need players have they got enough money will he get will he get enough money to sign those players major disappointment for the club tonight what do you make of mezzan urzel just chilling on the bench at this moment well all play but listen players deal with getting beat in different ways his performance i you know i look at these first doesn't look botheredly no it does not look bothered i look at his first half performance and alan said he did well and then in parts on the ball maybe he did i don't get i don't get what he brings to the side most of the time he steps up sometimes against the smaller clubs for a big world-class player that people keep talking about him i don't see enough of him and certainly in that second half went missing sat on the bench moaning to his players you know i shouldn't have been taken off or whatever he was saying i don't know what he's saying probably wronged me to speculate but i can pretty much guess what he was saying congratulations to marizio sarri a man who after years of impressing at nappley was recruited by chelsea into the english premier league but without a trophy or a title to his name he has just won his first trophy and let's not forget this after a season andy townsen in which he has gone public with his frustration at getting his messages through to his players he has withstood um players questioning his authority yep like keppa did in the in the league cup final and he has guided this team to third in the league to within a penalty shootout of winning that match and now the europea league how do you rate his impact his season has to be a success his season has to be viewed as a success it's had peaks and troughs i thought as i mentioned earlier it started well it then lost its way there was a lot of confusion around him and the direction that he appeared to be taking the team around christmas time they have gathered themselves he's weathered that storm he hasn't felt the love you know most chelsea managers when they go in there they they they get that and i think you've got it to start with and he hasn't really felt like he's he's admired by the by the chelsea fans and and and now i'd like to think i'd like to think those that have doubted him would come on and and and pay credit to his well his his his resilience because it's not been easy be very interested in here where he goes from here is he gonna come out make some statement after the game and say listen guys there's your trophy you wanted someone else you can have your wish i'm you know look he might he knows well he might he might jonathan he might will do that well chelsea done it the other way haven't they look they won't be they're not slowing get rid of you get rid of you and he will know that he will know that but uh but i think when you consider third place league cup final runners up and a europea league in your back pocket there's been worse chelsea seasons i can tell you some of your thought chelsea fans arsenal fans uh steve chelsea fans sari should keep his job now third place winning europea league it's a really good season tom i hope sari walks away from chelsea today and does so with his head held high after so much disrespect from players and fans alike um arsenal fan marwin didn't want to be in the champions league next season anyway distracts us from winning the league uh chris unsurprising really playing with 10 men our creative genius urzel may as well not have been on the pitch useless uh this from ed and azad in the past couple of moments talking live on television on the pitch i don't know yet in terms of his future i'll decide in the next few days only thing on my mind was winning a trophy he was then pushed on that particular issue as you might expect i've taken my decision already i'm just waiting for the clubs i think this is goodbye but you never know my dream was to play in the premier league and i have done this bye bye ed and azad thanks for coming and thanks for the memories i mean goodness me what a player he has been what a player probably the player of the abramovich era uh i mean he's had some good ones that's that's terry lampard drogba but azad yeah he's not there that's a debate let's let's know your thoughts 85058 um he finishes with 20 goals yep which is his best ever season and it's the one that's the one area with azad when when you're talking about a galactico which he's probably going to become you know those the Ronaldo's of this world on the messes a bazaar they score 50s and 60s a season is he capable of going to do in that look i'm not sure he's capable of going to do that but he's certainly capable of scoring regular mid 20s 30 a season i think he's that good and he should be scoring more goals and perhaps he has up to now our league's not so easy to get them but uh but but i think in aral madritcha he should be looking if he does happen he should be looking for 30 plus every season back inside the stadium the trophy is being brought towards the plinth you'll hear that live very shortly presumably gary k hill will join says our aspelik wetter for that moment which will be described by connor macnamara but alan pardra your thoughts on those azad quotes i've taken my decision already i think this is goodbye but you never know i think they speak for themselves those quotes um you know he's put in a great performance here you know as we said earlier if he moves on to real madrid then i think we'll all wish him well and good luck to be a big loss for the premier league because there's not many players who have the quality and the ability to to do the defense is what he's done tonight he has that drop of shoulder people underestimate how quick he is you can just once he gets level with you he just gets away from you and uh any ten towns and tell you he was not on particularly great mobile black midfield play like myself and that was the worst thing when they start running at your back for and you can't do nothing about it so you know he's uh he's a great talent and we're all going to miss him but you know let him join joey's moment tonight because um you know chelsea were terrific tonight and the the manager and the team uh they deserve the plaudits that are going to come their way just looking at social media though uh chelsea fans are intrigued by this additional line from asad where he says i'm just waiting for the clubs now what he means there we don't quite know but whether he's sort of like launching an auction or anything like that i mean we're all saying real madrid andy towns and but is that guaranteed i mean is there that's the possibility he could even stay in the premier league that's the destination he wants i think the player wants and that's the destination he deserves and when he says he's waiting for the clubs he what he's saying is he's just waiting for the cubs to agree the number that's what he's waiting for they will have obviously been dialogue going on heavy serious dialogue up to now and now it's just the case of getting the number right he hasn't done himself any favors tonight by playing as well as he has he's probably just slung an extra few quid on that um on that fee but uh but let me tell you he's uh he's absolutely few heroes on his wages as well yeah he's absolutely everything that realm adrid need right now um but but for chelsea and the premier league it's uh it will be a sad loss because he uh he illuminates illuminates our game more often than not and uh we don't we don't want to see our best players going and playing those we're well arson are going up to receive their runners up medals i see connor that mezzedurzel has wrenched himself up from the bench and is towards the the back end of that line but for for many of these players this is a crushing blow isn't it a crushing defeat and they will be thinking of their future as well and it won't quite be as appetizing as eddard hasard's future no the uh the future looks rather bleak for arson the moment this is a walk of shame for their players as they go through a a corridor that's been created by their victorious chelsea opponents that to walk through that disconsolate up onto a platform to receive their runners up medals which are being received well i guess with the the sort of disdain that we get always at these these big occasions these arsile players have got a very long flight home and they've got to try and rebuild over a summer in which it's going to be difficult to attract new players because of the situation now with no champions league football next season it's going to take an enormous effort for mooni emory to try and get to back into that top four i mean who's going to drop out to allow them in but for chelsea what a story you know for for morizio sarri a guy who if ever a coach has worked his way up from the bottom 19 different clubs the majority of them you'll have never heard of stia felaezy and della tego leto san sevino these lower league clubs rezzo avilino then eventually he starts to build his way up helis farona and perugia and serento and empley and he gets his way to nappoli and he comes ever so close to pipping uventas last season but he doesn't pick them and he doesn't get the trophy so for all the acclaim and everyone's saying what a good coach he is no silverware until now 60 years of age morizio sarri i think he'll be the happiest of all the chelsea staff and players because they know they're in the champions league next season most of them have i mean if not all of them have won trophies before alib par to this is morizio sarri's night yeah and a kind of you know for a manager like myself a manager's in the game what a great story that he's had to work this long to finally win a trophy and and he won it in style it wasn't like uh you know he's come here and won it on a robbery kind of breakaway kind of game he's dictated done well in the first half stayed in the game the second half were miles better team and um you know but uh in terms of what he's done this season as you say he's had some real downtime and he's managed to battle through that and you have to do that in front of him chelsea players going through among them ross parkley who of course left everton hoping to win trophies with chelsea about to receive a Europa League medal over his neck he didn't as a dot behind him all eyes on azar and those comments being made tonight as alexa de sefre puts the winners medal around his shoulders all this going on with our so players on the pitch watching on and unayemery like a character in a 1950s movie like humphrey bogart is leaning against the dugout he's got one foot in front of the other he's leaning dramatically out on his elbow and there's not much he can do he's to watch on as chelsea go behind the barrier and aspel acquetta and gary kale together lifts the europea league twice chelsea have been in this competition twice they have won it an unbeaten campaign in the europea league in 2018 2019 a season that's been written off at so many junctures but it ends with silverware it ends with a third place finish behind two of the most dominant finishers the premier league has ever seen and who knows this could be a night that in checks new enthusiasm for chelsea going forward the arsile players while all this is going on are walking around the back of the fireworks the back of the celebrations and heading over towards where the main body of arsile supporters are what a journey 5000 mile round trip to come to back to to watch a game with five goals but to lose four one arsile disconsolate but the chelsea celebrations continue as robert green is center stage robert green the third choice goalkeeper is given the trophy he raises it above his head to big acclaim as does marcus alonso now keppa gets involved and 24 hours ago they appeared to be squabbling they appeared to be fighting amongst themselves look at these scenes now rudiger is down there he's fulfilling the John terry roll he's got a proper suit on and a chelsea shirt over the top and he's raising the trophy for livi asia roue cast aside by arsile wins silverware for chelsea against arsile it's chelsea's night in baku and these celebrations for them could go on long into the evening alan it's just interesting to see rob green there i mean third choice goal it means he's out there every day he's shooting shooting everybody's shooting at him and he gets his reward because obviously he's not playing so great for him an old colleague of mine so i'm chuffed for him but chelsea by far the better side in the 90 minutes and again they have this great record of winning trophies particularly were european trophies it looks like it's a farewell to chelsea from eden azad but he's gone out in style he scored the third and fourth goals of a full one route against arsile of all opponents to give an extra sweetness to the chelsea victory and their supporters who've traveled here to baku azad celebrates chelsea celebrates and sarri as his first ever trophy will it be his last with chelsea these are going to be interesting times at sanford bridge yeah he's uh it's a weird scenario for for the for the ball that chelsea you know fans not really tip to him but he's delivered the trophy and they have this record of getting rid of managers after the one trophy so um it's still up in the air really i hope he stays because i think um he's just diligent so doing the job um of coming through some pretty low points in the in the season uh he's got his reward tonight and uh and he got it in style and there's nothing better than a final to win in style will this performance make him even more alluring to the likes of rail metroid the fact he can do it in the big finals like this 21 goals in a team that hasn't always been firing at old cylinders he's not an out and out striker it's a very impressive if he's in a team playing at a higher level than chelsea does he does his performance do you think rise to match that well i i don't think the level is that much greater at real Madrid but the opposition is less so he's goal tally for sure if he goes to the league he's going to go up that's why you can get 40 goals in the league you're just not going to get that in the premier league i don't can't remember the last player who got that kind of number so his numbers will go up and in those crucial games where he will be judged that real madrid is in this champions league in the big games against the Barcelona aphelic home adrid that's where his real judgment will come if he makes that move and a quick word on on unayemery who you know it feels such a moment of disappointment given though the situation he inherited i mean he's finished with more points than than our sybingers last season in charge he did get them to the final which is more than than arsail did last season at darsevega did has there been improvements from from arsail or do they find themselves back where they were a year ago now well i you know i the noise is coming out of arsail as what has league sort of commented on i think have been that the organization of the training ground the way they put the team together for the games has been better but they've got major weaknesses in that defense and i think only finance is going to change that with some new players i think they've got a lot of midfield players coming through so good batter young players and uh that that shows a good sign for the future but they really need to tighten that back that back group up all right well gentlemen the celebrations continue here jelsie about to go off in a lap of honor around the stadium displaying the gleaming silver where it's a wonderful cup is the europa league trophy it's the only way for cup that doesn't have handles on it and they are parading that around it's also the heaviest as well so sometimes you'll see two of them needing to hold it chelsea winning silver where again they beat arsail for one chelsea back up",
