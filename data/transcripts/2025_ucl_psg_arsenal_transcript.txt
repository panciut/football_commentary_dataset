 The Royal's are twirling them around, the Arsenal banners. They see a Royal standard in there as well with the Arsenal badge on it, and the players go into a huddle as close as they can towards that corner of the ground. So the teams tonight, as we've discussed, Usman Dembele, PSG's top scorer, 33 goals, scored the goal in the first leg. The enormous explosion goes off as the red flares are lit in the end to our left. PSG with Donnarummar in goal. Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho and Mendes, the familiar now back four, familiar middle three as well, Vittini, Joanne Eves and Fabian Ruiz. And then the front three. Expectation is that Desiree Douay will play through the middle, the 19-year-old, with Bradley Valkala and Keviche Claretscalia in the wide positions. We'll just see how that does settle down right now. It's Valkala who's over the ball in the centre circle actually. Arsenal's team tonight, Trossard's on the bench. There is the whistle from Felix Zviat, the German referee, and he gets us underway and PSG immediately hit the ball down the right-hand side and it's out of play for a throw. So the Arsenal team, Ryering goal, Kimba is fit, big doubt that he plays. Saliba and Kivio and Lewis Skelly at left back, then party. Suspended for the first leg last week, party, Odegaard and Reiss, and then Saka and Martinelli either side of Miquel, Marino playing as the auxiliary striker. And here's Bukaio Saka now for the first time for Arsenal, taking the ball on, but he can't get past Nuno Mendes, who clears it actually and it bounces into Saka, and then his right foot, he gives it away. So Arsenal back in possession with party, then it's up to Marino. Party goes in with a high foot on Fabian Ruiz, the ball bounces very high in the air, and then Odegaard, as he attempted to bring it down, ran away from him and PSG had got it back on the edge of the box. I'm assuming Arsenal won the toss and decided to change ends just to unsell. That's the first little sign that they're going to try and un-settle this PSG team. And they've started the game in a fashion of, we're going to make it physical, they've gone long, they've kicked the ball quite high, they want to make it a bit scrappy, they've got to turn it into a physical battle. And remember after Villarparque, Luis Enrique said that his team are not the biggest of teams. And Villarra in that second half made things uncomfortable for them. They punch above their weight really, John, physically, this Paris team. They do a great job physically, given the stature, but I think it's an area that Arsenal really have to try and exploit. Marino through the middle, long pass forward from Raya, clicked it on with his head, and then Marquinhos is able to win a throw in the right back area. And Marquinhos, the captain, great, great servant for this club. 12 years a PSG player, five years as captain. He clenches his fist to the supporters who respond with another enormous cheer. Arsenal, red and white shirts, white shorts, and it's been brought forward from the back by Saliba, forward of the centre-circle, but then to Timber, and then Timber. Rolls it into the path of Saka down the right wing. Saka cutting infield, but the challenge comes in on him. It was Kvarys Kali, but he's dispossessed by Timber, chance to cross into the penalty area, and it's headed wide on the edge of a six-yard box by Declan Rice, who holds his head. He had a defender there with him, but he couldn't direct it on target. Wow, big chance for Declan Rice. Gets good contact on the ball, really gets up high. I mean, it's Timber that won the ball back, gets it down the line, and crosses it, really nice flight, it ball into the box. Yeah, really good effort from Rice. First chance for the match. PSG 0, Arsenal 0. This is five-live. Remember, you can listen to all BBC Radio five-live included via BBC Sounds if you're on the move, via the BBC Sounds app. Here's Martin Ely, already seen one excellent piece of tackling back from him. Now he's heading in the right direction. Martin Ely down the left-hand side, and in comes the challenge from Hakimi, which puts it out of play and referees the virus as the final touch was off the PSG man. So it's a throw-in for Arsenal, made a good start. Trotter start from Arsenal, have to say. Confident, aggressive, taking the game to Paris, both Martin Ely on one side and Sakhar on the other. Long throw, Arsenal conceded from a long throw against Bournemouth on Saturday night. Let's see what they can do with this one. Long from party into the penalty area, but the load saved by Donoroma. The chance from close range, arriving in the six-yard box. And it was saved by Donoroma. And I think it was Martin Ely, who was the player, who got the contact in between all of those blue shirts. But Donoroma kept it out with his first save of the night. Well, big talking point before the game was the PSG goalkeeper. And so early on, he's delivered a brilliant reaction save down to his left. I mean, there's so many bodies in the box, brilliant long throw in. And he just has to react. The ball bouncing towards him, but it's just the reaction to parm it away. And it was Martin Ely, who's still in there. Good run, wasn't it? Yeah, excellent. And that could easily have been 1-0 as well. So strong start from Arsenal, but still 0-0, so PSG 1-0 up on the night. All for the right to play Inter in the final three weeks on Saturday. You'll hear that with us on Five Life. As Arsenal come forward again, the ball clipped right across the penalty area. Martin Ely gets it down, still in the box. Martin Ely right foot crossed. That's headed away by Nuno Mendes and then further away PSG. Really being put under pressure here by Arsenal in the early stages. And confounding what we've seen here, the evidence of our eyes when we were here with Manchester City and with Liverpool and with Aspen Ville as well. This is their eighth match, PSG, against English clubs in the Champions League this season. Here is Rice playing the ball to the right-hand side, Audegarde. Then Saka is challenged, might have been fouled, yes he was, by Nuno Mendes, and that's a three-kick near the halfway line. You get the impression that Kaio Saka's going to have to do something a little bit different to his normal game this season. He's got two kind of one-on-ones against Mendes in the left-back position, who's just outstanding in those duels. And I think he's going to have to find a different type of movement. A different solution to be impactful in this game because him and Cabaret Scalia really double up well defensively on that side. Yes, and here he is again, as Timber gives it to Saka. And it's Saka running at Nuno Mendes, and then infield away from Fortuna. Still Saka on the ball, 25 yards out, and he just, with his left foot, finds Martinelli, who's on the left flank. Martinelli takes on Bicicchini to the byline, trying to pull it back. And Hakimi, the recovering Hakimi, was able to block it behind. Another corner to Arsenal, first corner of the match to Arsenal. Yeah, it's a shame, he did what he needed to do. He kind of wriggled his way past Hakimi, and then didn't quite take the ball within Martinelli, got it caught under his feet, so he couldn't get his head up and find the cutback. There was players arriving in and around the penalty spot, but really good early signs from Arsenal. Martinelli and Saka both getting a lot of ball in that wide area. So set, piece, chance for Arsenal. You know the danger of that, PSG, well aware of it. Declan Rice to take this, just leans forward and pulls his socks right up, raises his left arm, Rice with the delivery of the corner to the back post, Donnarola comes and gets a punch on that, beyond the far post. Players, he didn't care. The big six-foot-five Italian goalkeeper was going to get to that ball, come what man in amongst the crowd of players, he punched it out for a throw. You don't see many goalkeepers go and get that ball so far deep. I mean, he went a long way there, Donnarama. Big decision to go, positive, but if you make that call and then you go and punch it as well as what he did, it was a right call. Another long throw, they're testing them, blocked out to the edge of the area. Oh, the guard! Oh, it's saved! Saved by Donnarama. That was an excellent save. That came through a crowd of players, down to his right, he flung himself at it and was able to turn it round the post. That was hit with some power from Donnarama as well. Wow, Arsenal can't believe. They're not level in this tie. What a save down to the left, it bobbles out to the edge of the box. Super hit from Oda guard, keeps it low, absolutely perfect, but what a reaction and again, it's that low to the left-hand side. I mean, how quickly he can get down Donnarama. The pace that that shot was hit through the bodies as well, John. He couldn't have been perfectly sighted to see that ball, but what a reaction. I mean, he's laying in a heap on the floor at the moment, he's not got up from that save. No, he's down on his back, whether he was winded by it, I'm not sure, because he went down with some force as well, because he had to. He had to go down very, very quickly and shot on the edge of the penalty area. I mean, the ball was a blur. It's a brilliant start from Arsenal. I mean, they couldn't have started this game any better, the confidence, the belief he's going to give the team to think we can go and win this tie. I mean, it's just something that PSG are going to have to have a look at. I think they're really pleased that they're having a bit of a break here, PSG. They've got a little bit of time just to have a chat with each other and get settled into this game. And there's the cheer, because Donnarama is on his feet. They sent out their Russian goalkeeper, Matve Safonov, who played at the weekend when they made ten changes and lost to... to Liam Rossini as Strasbourg on Saturday. But all of the big guns are back, with the exception of Dembele, who's on the bench, where they will see him. Remains to be seen. But Arsenal continuing this excellent start, still in the first ten minutes. Still 0-0, but they could easily have scored one, maybe two goals. Corner then in towards the near post from Saka. That's headed back out to the far side. It's just clear clouted, really, with his left foot up in the air. Fabian Ruiz, and then it's out of play for another throw. And here we go again, the long throw, clear tactic tonight. They're just setting it up. They're making this game as ugly and as physical as they possibly can, but they've had real flashes of quality in and around it so far. Kivyol comes up, he's at the near post. Marino's buzzing around. Here's the long, flat throw from Parti. That's headed away to the edge of the area, Audegarde with the shot, that's blocked, bounces back out. Parti lifts it across. Marino tries to get there, that's one in the air by Patrell for Paris Saint-Germain. Martin Ely, well defended. Very difficult that, that was a super throw from Parti. And then Lewis Skelly is challenged and stays down, and PSG are off now. Finally on the attack again, they've survived the pressure, but Hakimi, the groans from the PSG fans, told the story across the low cross, far too close to Raya, who's almost able to pick it up like a back pass. I think it's a case of sometimes too much time, and a lot of time to get his head up. Declan Reis does brilliantly, he makes the run back into the defensive left-back position, which allows Saliba to stay in the box. I mean, Saliba decided that very early on, he wasn't going to come out, because if he left that area, Arsenal were in big trouble, and he just panned out all right for them. So it's still Nel Nel, Paris Saint-Germain Nel, Arsenal Nel, but we've already seen very good saves from Donnaroma, from Martinelli, and from Odegaard to add to the saves that he made in the first leg when he kept a clean sheet at the Emirates. Arsenal, who have never come through a European tie when they've lost the first leg at home. Five previous instances of that, Arsenal have gone out on every occasion. So history is against them, but this is a unique night, and they've started very well. The only thing they're lacking is a goal, but they have one another throw in. So it's throw in number three, long throw number three, these are as good as corners. Party, standing way off the pitch, a big wind-up. Here he comes, the long throw with power into the edge of the six-yard box. Marquinhos heads that away, it's knotted back out by Saliba to Party, who's able to control this, and Party dummies to cross, then takes it away. Low balling with his left foot, but straight into the path of... ...Juaul Neves, who's able to control that, and between them, Hakimi and Juaul Neves are able to win the throw-in. Hakimi playing it off Martinelli, and out for a throw. PSG 0, Arsenal 0, five-life from the BBC. I like Martinelli's start to the game. He really has taken it to Hakimi, unsettled him, tried to rough him up. Every time he's got the ball, he's knocked it outside of him, tried to run. He's really asking a question of the full-back and putting him under pressure. Honestly, Matt, PSG have barely been out of their own half. No, we've always been doing, he's watching to the left, haven't we? In that half of the pitch, where Arsenal have just been controlling the game. And in the build-up to this match last week, certainly over the course of the last couple of days, when all of the talking has been going on, I've quite often said that PSG here this season have been almost irresistible. But Arsenal are hanging their hats on that word, almost. Here's Martinelli, Martinelli taking on Hakimi, but that's a win for the Moroccan right-back, strong challenge, out of play for a throw, but they're being tested in all defensive departments, PSG. And it's another long throw, this is number four. I think that is the point, John, they're being tested. So they've asked who have come here, and they're asking question after question in a different way, so a very different start from them than it was in the first leg at home. It really is a confident, aggressive start. I mean, this must be what the fifth throw in. Here we go, it's another long one from Thomas Pardi with a throw. Flick down, but cleared away by Quaretz-Kalia, packed penalty area, and the flick, unfortunately for Arsenal, right at the feet of the Georgian. But Arsenal take up possession again as they play from right to left as we look here in the first half. So it is all heads left as Audegarde gives it away. And then PSG give it away, and Luis Enrique suddenly, all in black tonight. But from his trainers, his white trainers, he becomes so animated there. Luis Enrique, his Paris Saint-Germain team who lost in the semifinals last season. Remember, there's a turn in center field, and actually there's been a collision there, but Arsenal continue the attack. Saka tries to take it on, he's claiming the final touch was off the defender, Pacho, but the assistant on the far side says no free kick. And was it Declan Rice who collided in center field? I think it was Declan Rice who chipped the ball out wide. It might have been Marino actually, I think Rice was arriving in the box, and Marino had dropped deep to have the ball. But that's working out really nicely for Arsenal, because sometimes Rice will go beyond him, and Marino drops into that familiar midfield role. It's a really nice interchange for that. And I think the reaction of Luis Enrique in that technical area, I mean, he's prowling that and coming out of the area very animated. Just a little indicator, so early on to be like that, he's concerned about the start of his team here. Yes, you can tell that from the body language, it's his birthday tomorrow. They went out of the Champions League on this day last year, so they went out of the Champions League in the semi-final on the eve of his birthday last year, 55 tomorrow. He was asked yesterday when I went out to the PSG campus, as they call it, their training ground, which is out on the edge of the city, out to the west, near Placie. Very impressive it is, as it's given away by Nuno Mendes. Now, Martin Ali finds Marino, then to his right, to Odegaard. Odegaard trying to find a position, but pass along the edge of the penalty area, wrong decision, gave it away, couldn't find a teammate, and now it's PSG who break away with the teenager, Duet. He's carried the ball already 30 yards, but Arsenal are quickly back in position, and they force him to play it back to little Vettiniya with his hair bobbing, and the momentum of the breakaways has slowed, although here is Barclay on the right-hand side, Bradley Barclay, who has played in every match this season for PSG. This is his 54th appearance of the season, whether as a starter or as a very effective substitute. 19 goals for him now this season. He scored the PSG goal against Strasbourg on Saturday. We're 16 minutes into the game. It's the first time, I think, where I've felt like PSG have just had control of the ball, or certainly any possession in the Arsenal half. I mean, that's how well Arsenal have started this game. But the frustration for them will be that they weren't able to get the ball into the net, and now Kaveritsch-Kaelya to Duet, back to Kaveritsch-Kaelya on the left-hand side. Straight for Chanoi, hits the post, bounces down, and Lewis Scali was able to get something on that, because Barclay was there, but Lewis Scali was just able to see it back to Raya, with the post from PSG going in front. It's just a horrible sight for a defender, when Kaveritsch-Kaelya is coming inside on his right foot. He can go either way, but when he comes inside there, he's devastated. He gets the angle, what a shot off the post, and that would have been cruel for Arsenal had that gone in the back of the net. I have to say, I thought it was him. Yeah, I did. Given the body language, Kaveritsch-Kaelya, the dive of Raya to his left, and also the reaction of the supporters. He's nearly unstoppable when he's in that zone. The flow and the sway of his upper body, when he's doing those stepovers and dropping his shoulder and creating that half-yard to get the shot off, and then the shot is generally perfectly placed. Ball played forward, the Douay won't reach that, and it bounces away through for a goal kick, bounces into the ever-changing electronic advertising hoardings. I think all of the smoke has just about cleared down. When you look at the lights, you can still see... Still a little bit of it hanging there. In front of the lights. All manner of flags being waved in the ultra's end to have a left. The PSG nil, Arsenal nil, one nil to the French champions as Arsenal come forward again. Timber, who's in field, and a yellow card is being shown. It's Mendes, isn't it? Is it Nuno Mendes? I think it is. Who's protesting to the referee. So that's interesting. That's a positive thing for Arsenal. Yeah, now Saka is going to be up against Nuno Mendes on an early yellow card, 18 minutes play. Yeah, he went to ground to try and win the ball, didn't win the ball, and just caught his studs. It was a little bit of a reckless tackle, and the referee has come over and punished it early with a yellow card. I mean, he's not best happy about it. He just catches the foot of Timber as he's driving past him. It's not a horrendous tackle, but I can understand why the yellow cards come out. Now they've got to get in one-to-one with Saka more often. So immediately, free-kick taken, and it's given by Reis to Saka. Then back to Reis, though, and it comes out to Martin Ali. Chests it down, but shoots into the crowded edge of the penalty area. And then excellent footwork from Vettini, dragged the ball back, killed the pass forward, but well defended, as Matt Upson says by Miles Lewis, Skelly, against Hakimi. And the margins for Ero were very fine for Lewis Skelly there, as Timber bounces into a challenge. Now he has Saka again on the far side. Ord, as well, comes in fill-up. He might have been caught by Joan Neves, but referee Zvaya's not interested in that. PSG have got it back on the edge of the penalty area, and it's still 0-0. Yeah, he's taken quite a hard line with the game, the referee. There's a couple of things that you might have considered a foul, and he's just waved play on. But that little piece of defending from Lewis Skelly there, John, I can't tell you how difficult that was. The ball's bouncing over your head, you're running back towards your own goal, you're around the halfway line, you've got a player with the pace of Barca, they're bearing down on you, and you manage, he uses his body in such a mature fashion, this young player. He just gets his hips and his back, and his backside around to shield the ball, and then swivels out with it, it was a lovely piece of defending. And there's another excellent tackle by Timber on Claret's calia. You know, the feel at the moment is good for Arsenal. You know, there's some impressive duels being won. By Arsenal players in many areas of the field, and this belief that they talked about yesterday, well, they are producing so far, but still no goal. 20 minutes played. Arsenal going back to party on the halfway line, here's Lewis Skelly in a central position, just drags it back and plays it back to the halfway line. Audegarde up to the right, and then they will go back to the halfway line again. So, Nel Nel, this night that is a giant fork in the road to Munich. Audegarde coming in from the right, thought about shooting, but didn't. In the end, thought he might have one goal from the edge of the area. Instead, it's Martin Ely, Martin Ely taking on Hikini, who gets his foot in, the ball rolls away behind for a corner. Is that the point about Martin Ely there? John just did so well, drove with the ball, went past two players, got the momentum, then has that stepping side of the pitch a little bit more, he's got a lovely angle to just let that left foot go, and he chooses to offload it. That to me is, get that shot off, he's more than capable of scoring at that point. Corner then, from the left, for Arsenal. This is corner number three, Donnarumma, just waits on his line, orange-backed gloves, his arms dangled by his sides, then Arsenal players run in all directions. Here's the delivery, a little glance out to the edge of the area, PSG head on that, order guard, couldn't get the shot in. Lewis Skelly heads it forward to the edge of the box, Saka tried to lay it off, bounces back to Saka, who works the pass forward, that's a nice touch from Marino. Now the ball in from the right-hand side, from Timber, but it's too close to Donnarumma, who's able just to allow the ball to bounce up into his midriff. Yeah, the snap into the tackle's good from Arsenal, the loose ball, anything that's dropping in the midfield is a bit of a bouncing ball, where two players are battling. I have to say, at the moment they're coming out on more of those duels on top, and that's the problem for PSG, they're just not getting hold of the ball, because Arsenal are just turning it over like they have done just now. Giving away again, Hakimi under pressure from Martin Ely. Arsenal players working tremendously hard, and it comes back into the centre-circle. Oh, and that's a little short to Kivio, the pass from Saliba, now Barcalo's away, and then Douay, edge of the area, Douay shoots weakly. And Raya was able to go down to his right and save that, really. And routine save, it opened up for PSG though, but they couldn't take advantage. Well, Julien Laurent said the words before the game, Saliba can't have a mistake, like he did against Madrid, like he did in the Premier League recently as well, and that was very much of that ilk, what a dangerous ball to play. It gets cut out, and really, Arsenal should have been punished. It was a soft finish in the end from Douay. He should do better, but Saliba very lucky to be let off the hook there. Yes, the Crystal Palace match, wasn't it? It was, yes. And Mateta scored so well in the 2-2 draw. Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal, Arsenal have won their last four away matches in the Champions League, they'd never won five in a row away from home. Yeah, well, just hopefully that's his mistake with the ball out of the way there, John. Declan Rice in possession. He had an early chance as well with a header, didn't he? Which was Arsenal's first opportunity. Saliba then playing the ball forward to Marino, no tross-hard in the team tonight, forward to Lewis Skelly. Now on the left-hand side, from Timber, actually, the pass out to Martin Ellie, Lewis Skelly on the overlap to his left, but he comes back in field with the ball to Odegaard. Odegaard goes right, then back out to the left again. Lewis Skelly, left foot across, that's very high, I think he's over-hitted. No, it's still in play, but it's over the top of Saka, and then Nuno Mendes goes in on the challenge, goes sprawling down. Did he win the free kick or is it a throwing? Yes, I think it's a free kick to PSG. It is a free kick, but just how audacious that is from Mendes to actually run around Saka to try and win that ball is just a sign of the confidence that this PSG left back has in himself physically and with his pace to dominate anyone. And I have to say, on the whole, I don't see him get beaten. I think he's the best in the world at the moment in that left-back position. So, 0-0 it is. Arsenal, who, as we mentioned last week, have not scored now in their last six semi-final matches. PSG with it at the back, but that's given away by Marquinhos. More groans, and Lewis Skelly's able to take it on towards the edge of the penalty area, but then blue, red and white shirts converge on him. It's brought away by Fabian Ruiz, and Vettini has to hold off Audicard, but he's got support and help from Saka, and Saka takes it on, but then going central. He ran into Vettini, Fabian Ruiz, passes it to Hakimi. Arsenal now need to get their defensive heads on again, do it back to Hakimi, but PSG go back into their own heart. There's just a breakaway goal feeling around this match at the moment. Arsenal, it's almost too good to be true, John, in terms of how they're managing the game, and you just feel that Paris are going to have a breakaway situation, just like the one they have with the mistake from Saliba. That is the risk that Arsenal are running here. They're almost being too dominant with the ball, and you've got so many players committed forward that when it breaks down on the edge of the Paris box, they can be in big trouble, because they've got such good quality in place in the front three. There's Arsenal playing it out from the back. Raya passing it to Declan Rice, who had... ...Kvaritz-Kirlia all over him. It's a heavy touch from Rice, from Raya's ball out, and Rice has fouled Kvaritz-Kirlia, and it's a yellow card for the Arsenal midfielder. I'm not too keen on the pass out in that area. Well, that's gone wrong for Arsenal several times recently as well. Again, for me, that's a managed the game a bit. I mean, Rice, a pass into him is on, but you've got to bear in mind, even if he has a perfect touch there, John, what's he going to do with the ball? He's running back towards the corner of his own eight-in-yard box. He's got a group of players really in a high press after him. I don't think he can really wriggle out that with the best touch ever. He didn't have a good touch, which is why he made the foul, but it's not a pass from me that David Raya should consider at that moment. So it's a yellow card apiece now, for Declan Rice for Arsenal and Mendes for PSG, but this is a free kick, good position, Vatinya has over the ball. And Arsenal holding the line probably a couple of yards inside there, half. Barrett-Kirlia comes across with his hand up to his mouth and whispers something to Vatinya. Right-footed free kick towards the back post, that's headed out by party to the edge of the area. Fabian Ruiz! So he scores! Fabian Ruiz makes it one-nil on the night to Paris Saint-Germain. And for all of Arsenal's pressure, for all of their chances, it's the French champions who take the lead. He drove it powerfully for a crowd of players past the dive of Raya. It's one-nil to Paris Saint-Germain on the night. They've doubled their lead in the tie, two-nil on aggregate. What a hit from Fabian Ruiz. You can't take anything away from the quality of this strike, but it's another set play that Arsenal don't defend well enough. OK, Thomas' party wins the first header, but he heads the ball back right into that edge of the box danger area, where his PSG players just lurking. Martin Ely then just gets sucked in. He's running across the box, where he's just got to put the brakes on. Not try and win the ball, but just stop Fabian Ruiz from getting any kind of control on the ball, but he runs way past him. The touch to his left foot off his chest is brilliant. The ball is bouncing, and the strike, I mean, he really swings that left foot at the ball, but he gets a perfect connection, and it just drills past Raya. He's got no chance really of reacting. It's a brilliant finish, but you feel it's a goal that Arsenal should defend better. Yeah. They'll be kicking themselves. The way that they con... You know, the ball out from Raya, the conceding of the free kick. That defensive header from party... That's the difference. Those decisions, that game management experience at this level, they're the difference. Bringing that situation on themselves didn't need to happen. Quite the contrast, the way that PSG have... have soaked up the pressure, and some pressure from Arsenal as well, but Arsenal couldn't find a way through. Donoruma making the saves, and now the explosions of flares, and the smoke pours down out of the stand behind the goal to our left. Audegarde crossing for Arsenal, to the back post. That's headed down, but cleared away by Marquinhos on the edge of the area. Back to Sacher on the right-hand side, so Arsenal now 2-0 down in the tie. This match tonight, they've got to win tonight, and they're losing. 1-0 at home, 1-0 away. That's given away by Lewis Skelly. Gwarris-Galer takes it on, passes it to Barcala, Barcala beats Lewis Skelly, and shoots and saves by Raya. As Rice came in with the challenge, Barcala couldn't finish. And if he had finished, that might have been Arsenal finished. Come on, the game is going in a style that's just really suit in PSG. Arsenal have started very well, they had so much of the ball, but when there's a mistake or a slightly short pass, wow, their counter-attack is swift, it's decisive, it's so sharp, and really, they should have had two goals on the break already, and it's only Declan Rice that manages to get back to stop the shot. Here's the corner, Douay pulls it to the edge of the area, Hakini's right underneath that, though has Sacher challenged him and hoisted the shot high over the top, actually landed on this blue carpet that is behind the goal, and all around the pitch, this PSG blue, massive badge, Paris Saint-Germain, that landed right in the middle of the R of Paris. So 1-0 to PSG, Fabian Ruiz, the goal scorer, the Spanish international part of the team that won the Euros last year, an important part of that team, that's his first goal in the Champions League this season for Paris Saint-Germain, and what an important one it was. PSG's eyes now, very much closing in on Munich and the final against Inter at the end of the month, Saturday the 31st, it is, on the evening of, and Arsenal, the task has just got a great deal harder, and yes, they had chances, Voritz Kehle with his shot against the post, the chance as well, that Douay had when he shot weakly at Raya, but the opening goal, the crucial opening goal, has gone to Lewis-Henry Fez-Tin. The scary thing is, John, they've had all those chances, and they barely had the ball, and that's what makes them an incredible team, because yes, they can pop it around and build, but they're absolutely lethal in situations like this, when you've got to come out, you've got to try and press and force the issue like Arsenal have to be in a goal down, two goals down now, but they become even more dangerous in this situation. They do, as Kebarat's Kehle and the mood has changed as well. Inside the stadium here, we're setting high up, just for the right of the halfway line, looking down on Lewis-Henry, Michael Arteger is out there as well, various hand signals, now he looks exasperated as well, Arsenal coming forward though, Timber with a cross, it's a deep one, Rice backs away, Rice heads it across, hook goal, it's by Marino, but it drops wide of the top right corner, with Donnaroma scumploring across his six-yard box, it's behind, it's a goal kick, and this noise now, listen to this, inside this stadium, the sound of a jubilant, aboyant Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal have had all the ball, but PSG have had all the moments, and I clue Donnaroma in that, two cracking early saves in this game, when they're under real pressure, and then the attacking play that's followed after, you know, that's the difference in this game, their players have really stepped up in those moments and produced something. Goal kick from Donnaroma, forward from Rice, but that will just run away for PSG, Hakimi chasing it, and there is the feeling here, inside the stadium, there is the feeling that PSG have weathered the storm. But Arsenal have got other ideas, here's Rice, Rice receives it from Audegarde, stretching forward, passes it to Martin, early on the left-hand side, got a shove in the back there, as a result of that, carried the ball out of play, he'd gone down, he might have won a free kick, but it's a goal kick to PSG. Let me just tell you as well, that over the course of history in the Champions League, there have been only two cases of teams who have lost the first leg at home, yet still gone on to win that semi-final and get through to the final. And this is where I'm offering a crumb of hope here, because the most recent of them was Tottenham, against Ajax back in 2019. They lost 1-0 at home, against Ajax, if you remember, and then went 2-0 down on the night, so they were 3-0 down, and then Lukas Moura came and scored the hat-trick in the second half, so let's not give it up just yet. No, but it took one of the craziest moments in European football to make that happen, didn't it, to turn that around, and that's what Arsenal need now. Yep, six years ago, tomorrow, that was, so that means six years ago today, was Liverpool's comeback against Barcelona the night before. PSG with a ball with Pacho in his left-back area, chips it forward, and it drifts out of play, and after all of that smoke cleared, we're back to square one, aren't we? Still one red flare is burning away in the top tier. I'm sure they've got their plans already, these PSG supporters, and they will bring real life to Munich for that final, if that were to be the case. Arsenal in the PSG left-back area, but that breaks down, PSG have got it back, and Kavara Takeda dancing forward with the ball, he's fouled, and that's a free kick to the home side, halfway inside the wrong half, so 10 minutes to go to halftime, Matt. PSG won Arsenal, 0-2, they're long aggregate. Difficult situation for Arsenal now, and they've just got to be careful, the body language doesn't change, the belief is still there. There's two goals that they need to find now in this incredibly difficult situation against a team that is so hot on the break, they really aren't any slipped pass or misread or weight of passes wrong, they're on it, and they've got runners going forward, so they've got to be aware of that Arsenal, they just want to have a good 10 minutes into halftime and then regroup. Arsenal win the ball back, over there on the far side, Saka now direct running towards the edge of the penalty area, Cross comes in from the right-hand side, it's deflected, only half headed away by Patro after Rice put the ball in, Rice chases him over there out into the left-back area, but Patro gets there first and blasts it out of play for throwing to Arsenal near the halfway line. There is five live Champions League final score tonight, by the way, it's a great time to us, to the five live commentary alongside the final score graphics, that is on the BBC Sport website and app, it's on the red button, or you can look on the iPlayer as well, just click on five live final score, and the highlights are on BBC One Champions League match of the day later after the news, and if you haven't seen them yet, you really want to watch the highlights of last night, which was extraordinary, and they'll be available on the iPlayer as well from I think 10 o'clock onwards, but match of the day on BBC One tonight. So at the moment you'll be watching Fabian Ruiz's goal, one goal in the first leg for PSG, so far one in the second for the French Champions, but Marino heading to Rice, Rice has shot that clock, comes out to Audegarde, Audegarde then finds Martinelli, Martinelli who made a good start against Takimi, slips the ball past him, but there was defensive cover there from Truand-Nerbez, Martinelli does well, gets the ball in, then the shot on the edge of the area from Timber, that too blocked by Paris Saint-Germain on the edge of their own penalty area, and then the ball is lifted forward by Saliba, bounces on the left corner of the penalty area, with a high foot from Martinelli, but it's not given us a free kick, because Takimi brought the ball away and he's still going, so Arsenal have to get back, and then just blinks it past Louis Skelly, that was cool, Douay then with the pass, but he's over hit that, and Arsenal will have to clear through Saliba, which they do, but that's given away, headed forward, Truand-Nerbez is onto this, moving in field, 25 yards out, he's got Kvaratskalia, I'd use him if I was him, Kvaratskalia then into the area, but Saliba comes across and is just able to, with his right foot, clear it away desperately. When he gets those jinky feet moving at players, it's very difficult to stop Kvaratskalia, nearly impossible, I'd say, just poked it through, they're trying to get the other side, but the big surprise with him, and I've seen it a lot tonight, he's made about two or three really important blocks in his own 18-yard box, he really does give protection to Nuno Mendes in the left-back position, and he works incredibly hard defensively. Truand-Nerbez has been dispossessed by Thomas Party, but then the pass is over here to PSG, they've got it back in their own half. At half-time, we will be crossing to Rome again, Russell Fuller is there, the tennis in Rome, we're not far away from Roland Garros here, are we? It's just a stone's throw away, Court Philippe Chatterier, which I've seen in the flesh, as it were, for the first time, since it was rebuilt, very impressive it is, as the ball is taken down by Douet, so we will be hearing from Jack Draper at half-time with Russell, I heard Russell say it was a little bit chilly in Rome, it's a lovely temperature here tonight, not warm at all. No, you could get better conditions for a football game, there's barely any breeze, it's a nice cool evening, slick pitch in a stadium like this, no better place to be playing or watching football at the moment. Not as cool as Bordeaux, though, according to Paul Robinson. Bordeaux sounded a bit nitty, didn't it? Bordeaux, so Alistair Bruce Ball will be getting there as well, if he's not there already, so that's what you'll be hearing on Five Life Tomorrow Night, and that should be a tremendous listen to hear the sounds of Norway as Tottenham go there and try to reach the Europa League final, whereas the Manchester United match will be live from Old Trafford on Sport Extra, so a great choice of listening for you tomorrow night, and obviously we'll be with Chelsea as well to see if they can claim their place, and they should in the conference final. But it's PSG going through to the Champions League final with this scoreline, one-nil, very enjoyable first half, Arsenal have been very, very good, but PSG, they couldn't find a way through, and Fabian Ruiz scored that goal just short of a half hour. Here is Vittinia, the little former Wolves midfielder, who certainly come on leaps and bands here at the Parc de France. That's given away by Hikini, but it's won back by Jo Arneves, he's into the area now, Douay, lots of Arsenal players back, a back heel, and Jo Arneves takes it away from PSG, and it's cleared away by Timber to the half-way line, and then forward from Patio, and out of play for an Arsenal throw. I'll tell you how quickly is Jo Arneves into the tackle, John. Wow, he is snapping about in that midfield, any little loose ball. If you don't protect that ball with your body well enough, he's got to be with his real low centre of gravity and quick feet, and that kind of stocky, quite strong build, but he's very light on his feet. He just gets after the ball, and he can get low, and in and around your ankles, around your hips, and he just gets a toe on the ball, and he scurries after it. He's such a good midfield player out of possession. Yes, the Portuguese, sturdy little figure, isn't he? 20 years old, they bid 60 million euros, for him from Benfica, Paris Saint-Germain, that they are defending right now, Arsenal on the attack as the first half moves into the last five minutes, cross from the right-hand side, that's headed down and away by Patio, and then cleared further away towards the half-way line. Kivio, the Polish international central defender, his ball to the edge of the box, that's just cleared up in the air by Nuno Mendes, forward from Reis, but PSG have got that one away as well. Hakimi lost his footing, plays it in field though to Joao Neves and PSG have got it safely back near the edge of their own penalty area. They've got more of a measure of control now, PSG. Yes, and the atmosphere has changed in the ground, hasn't it? There's a calmness and a relaxed atmosphere now. It was a little bit edgy in that first 15 minutes. So, Arsenal, with the ball on the right, in comes the challenge from Douay this time. Douay back there, almost in his own left-back position. That's been a feature, hasn't it? Barcala, Douay, Kivarets, Kalea, as you've said, really helping out the back line, but here's Sakat now, lovely. Ball into the middle, Marino dies for it, but couldn't get any meaningful touch on that at the near post, edge of the six-yard box, and it was through him in a flash and beyond the ball kick. They need something, Arsenal, something like this to go in a toe from Marino into the far post, just anything to get them back in this game, because at the moment they're creating good situations without that real final product. Must win match tonight for Arsenal, otherwise they're out. These are the two clubs that have played the most matches in this competition without actually going on to win it. And only one French club has ever been European champions, winners of either the European Cup or the Champions League, and that's their big rivals, Marseille, Chris Waddle's old team, when they won it back in 1993. And as our friend in the Bistro, Ackill told us last night, Marseille won it in Munich. And this year's final is also in that great Barbarian city. Kavaric's Kalea turns on the half-way line, he was challenged by Timber, wanted a free kick for that. Referee's Vias not interested. He's got good football knowledge. Our friend Ackill, isn't he? It's incredible football knowledge. Unbelievable what he did about English football and European football. Yes, and he was a little edgy about this, but I think confident he's already made his plans for Munich, as Raya, long, long pass downfield from him, Sacher on the chase. No-no-menders is with him. They're into the penalty area now on the right-hand side. Gets the ball across, cleared away by Marquinhos, though. There were two men in there, Reiss and Martin Ali, but Marquinhos was able to find himself in the right place. Then Hakini with a long pass, Barcala taking on Louis Skelly, down the right wing, is able to get the ball down, plays it across, Douay on the edge of the area, the teenager, beats Kivill, right foot shot into the body of Louis Skelly, who's gone down. Might have hit him in the face, actually. And therefore the referee stopped playing, much to the frustration of the PSG supporters. So Louis Skelly stays down, and at that moment, Anottas Nikola Teterin and Luis Enrique both almost in unison there, turned around, walked back, picked up a water bottle, and returned to their coaches on the bench. Yeah, breaking play where they can just take their eyes off this game. I mean, it is intense. There's little jewels and little moments on the pitch all the time, and this one, when he's a fair old hit from Douay, and it does catch Louis Skelly, he gets side on, and the ball strikes him right just underneath the ribs. Really took the wind out of his sails. Yeah, so it's going to be a drop ball, the referee just goes across to Douay to explain what he's going to do. I mean, I know it's not a head injury, but I think the referee's right to, you know, probably stop the game. A lot of people would argue and say he should have played on, but... So he's dropped the ball, and now he's asked to get it back. I'm not sure what happened there. Anyway, he's dropped the ball, and Douay unchallenged, so it's an uncontested drop ball, really, and Douay plays it back to Hakimi. Half-time approaching, run the last minute of the first 45. Paris-Saint-Germain won Arsenal, no, two minutes. I didn't show up in two minutes. There we are. You'll have heard that. Two minutes. Look, two minutes. Ball's out of play for a throw to PSG over there on the far side, halfway inside their own half. I mentioned that we are a stones throw away from Roland Garros, stones throw away from the Sain as well, not far from the Bois de Boulogne. Julian Laurent before the match, what is that in French? How would you say a stones throw? And it is Aquelques & Cableux. A stones throw. I thought that was going to come out differently then, for a moment. Raya is able to get the ball downfield, and Rice strides on, gives it to Odegaard. Now he has Saka in added time. Saka's ball across, but Hakimi is able to position himself perfectly. Martinelli behind him, and left-footed, he clears it out of play on the far side, and Martinelli, frustration there, just followed on through and kicked the post. He's got to get across the face of him. Arsenal are going to run out of opportunities to make these situations count. He's a good position from Hakimi, he touched right in where he should be, but Martinelli has to make that happen. Back to the long throws from Arsenal, Partier comes off the head of Catini, but up in the air it went, and then Donnarumma arrives, throwing himself headlong to catch the ball, like a green flash he was, and he's got it safely in his hands. And that's been the story of the first half, really. Arsenal have been good. Yeah. But... Not quite good enough. Not quite good enough to just make those chances count. And a little bit of that is PSG, i.e. Donnarumma, has really made two excellent saves. So that could have been very different in that first ten minutes, if he doesn't get down to make that save from Odegaard. The pitch is completely different. But Scalia has fouled Saliba, so that's a free kick to Arsenal, near the right corner of the box. Well, coming here tonight, we knew that either Arsenal or PSG, by the end of the evening would be appearing in a second Champions League final, and as the halftime whistle goes with this scoreline, it is going to be Paris Saint-Germain, leading through that Fabian Ruiz goal, that well-struck goal from the edge of the area, following the free kick, and then the final thinking of the chances that they've had. Nicola Teta, Declan Rice yesterday, saying that they needed magical moments and so close, particularly really the chance for Martinelli, Odegaard as well, with that fiercely struck shot, but Donnarumma making the saves as he did at the Emirates. Yeah, they've laid the foundation, has had the substance to the performance, has been excellent. They've asked a question, I think they've been aggressive, they've taken the game to PSG, they've unsettled them in the opening 15 minutes, but what he said in the press conference about the magical moments, they've been on the other side, they've produced those, the goalkeepers produced the moment, Fabian Ruiz has produced an outstanding finish, so that's why they're behind, and that I guess is what this competition is all about, the quality of player that can do things like they've done, and Arsenal just haven't put the finishing touches to that. Yeah, so halftime here, suddenly it feels like the atmosphere, that's been bubbling throughout the course of the first half, it's just lulled a little, and 1-0 at halftime, Paris and Jermaine won, Arsenal 0-2-0 on aggregate. It is compelling, is this Champions League, 75 and all second leg, and that, with half an hour gone, Arsenal could have been 2-0 up or 3-0 down. Yeah, you're right, they really could, and for Paris to be as devastating and as cutting as what they were, not having the ballchappers, they just didn't have it, but they didn't seem to mind, they've got a goalkeeper that's pulling out saves like the one he did for Martin Odegaard's shot, I think the wide players have defended well, they're punching their weight okay in terms of dealing with the throw-ins, and it just hasn't dropped for Arsenal, but then to go and do what they did, and look so dangerous, I mean it's a tough one for Arsenal to crack, isn't it, because the more ball and the more control you have, sometimes you're even more vulnerable at that point. I mean that is one of the great saves, isn't it? I think so. One of the reasons I say that is, I've done enough with Joe Hart this season for him to tell me about wherever the shot is from, you then have to look from where a goalkeeper actually sees it from, and he probably had 7 yards maybe to react to a shot that was absolutely thumped. It wasn't curled or anything, it was thumped. That could have been as fiercely hit a shot as I've seen all season. It was travelling. And it was along the turf as well, so it wasn't even one of those that had a little bit of height to it, it was going right along the ground, and it was through all of those bodies, and it was interesting that we had that detailed chat with Robo, wasn't it before the game about these situations and the reaction time, and he was quite close to his line, wasn't he? He had come out a couple of yards, which maybe, as Robo explained, gave him the time to actually get down, because to be that big and then get down to your ankles in that low to react like that, it's not easy. So he gives himself the reaction time in order to do it, and what a fabulous save, and what a contribution he's made to this game. And tactically, really, until the goal, Arsenal were absolutely spot on, weren't they? Timber was high, Lewis Skelly was inverted, Erdogan was playing off Marino and would also then drop for any corner or long throw to pick it up on the edge of the box. I mean, they had Paris Saint-Germain for that first 25 minutes. Yeah, they needed the goal, Chappers, didn't they? You know, if you're going to start that well here, you need one of those throw-ins to drop, and somebody hook one in, or for Donorama not to produce such a brilliant piece of goalkeeping, they needed something in that period to go their way. And when it didn't, and then you saw the break of PSG and Kavaris-Kalia just scares me to death when I see him just touching that ball, arriving in that corner of the 18-yard box. If you're a fullback, you are just, your head's thinking, what do I do here? He can go outside, inside, he runs at you, he goes through you, whatever it may be, and he does it with such speed. It's just a joy to watch. Maybe, John, the only shot that's been hit harder was the actual Paris Saint-Germain goal. Oh, well, I know, I think Audigards was, I think it was, I mean, it was very well hit, but I'm saying Audigards. Honestly, it was a blur. Yeah, I mean, Arsenal weren't great with the defending on that set piece, though, Chappers. I think they let himself down with that. Martinelli's got to put the brakes on, party heads it right back into that danger area. Those little fine details were just out, and that's where they paid the price. Aigilia Noura, who is alongside John and Matt as well, and yet, for everything that we've just discussed about where Arsenal had the advantage, Paris Saint-Germain should really be home and dry now, shouldn't they? Yeah, I think so, apart from the goal, there's those two counterattacks really that they didn't play well, the one for Douay on the Barcola interception, really, and then the one for Barcola, like Vasquez, gives him, well, PSG is just so good, Fabian Riz, again, in one touch, puts him through, but then when you've suffered so much for the first half hour of your PSG, you're also lucky that you haven't considered, really, because they've been rattled, like, I've rarely seen them this season being so on the back foot and so on the pressure, like, Arsenal put them in the first half an hour, but it's what we said pretty much for Arsenal to qualify for the final, they would have to be perfect, and they might have lost this tie on the first 15 minutes of the two legs at home in the first leg, and tonight here, because they could have been two nil after 10 minutes, and the game would have been completely different. So you're still nervous? So no, I didn't sit down. That's where I was sad. I could not sit, I was standing up the whole first 45 minutes, it's just, because we knew it was going to be a great game, very different to yesterday, of course, because those teams have different qualities and flows than Barcelona and Inter Milan, but tactically, I think for Arsenal to have the perfect game plan, for Arsenal to be so good and do so many good things, and yet to be two nil down on aggregate, this is what football is about, though, you might be the best team, and yet somehow find yourself in the losing side. Have you been like a cat on a hot tin roof? It was more of a... What's that in French? Chasse sur le toit? Yeah. But I've been more like a statue, John, I promise you, I could hardly move, it was inferno. I mean, you really mangled stones' throat, didn't you? Let's be honest. Second half. Butchers. Are you rude? See, I should have heard it, Jules, it was perfect. Second half on the way, brilliant first 45 minutes, Arsenal are not out of it, but they're one nil down on the night, and they are two nil down on aggregate.

And welcome to the Karl Walker Podcast with me and Malang and Brownie in Manchester. Walker, just brilliantly, brilliantly.

Listen on BBC Sounds. Back to Paris shortly, where Paris Saint-Germain lead 1-0 on the night. 2-0 on aggregate. Let's head to Rome, though, and the Italian Open Tennis. Correspondent Russell Fuller is there. What's to doubt for you on the first round so far? We are still going fairly late in the night, and it's a chilly night, too, in Rome. Mark with Emma Raddickanu now about to begin a deciding set against Maya Joint, the 19-year-old Australian qualifier. Raddickanu won the first set by seven games to five, and really should have won the second as well. She served for the match. She was twice the break-up, but she's just lost a tie break by seven points to one, so a third set coming shortly. On this court earlier, Cameron Norrie had a win as a lucky loser, having lost in qualifying yesterday. He beat Chris O'Connell in straight sets. He'll take on Daniel Medvedev in the second round on Friday. But the British number one, Katie Bolter, went out in straight sets to a former French Open runner-up in Anastasia Pavliuchenkova. And then a lot of British eyes, certainly, on Jack Draper, who will arrive in Rome, Russell, in the top five in the world. Yes, and second in the annual race, the rankings that are calculated from the start of the year. And remember that the top eight qualify for the ATP final. So that's very much a goal for Jack Draper, who has been the special one on the men's side for a few years now, for many years now. But of course, no one quite knows whether that talent is going to develop in a way it would be hoped. I think the fact that he had a late growth spurt turned him into a six-foot-four man help. The fact that he's a left-hander helps too. Naturally, a right-hander, in fact, but he just picked up a racket with his left hand when he was hitting against a wall when he was younger and continued playing in that way. So that's certainly another little advantage. And three titles in the past year, and then nearly a fourth having just missed out on the Madrid Open title last weekend. Well, let's hear from him on how he's feeling after that defeat to Casparud in the Madrid final. Hurt and gutted with the final and the way it kind of went in the end. I think overall, I'm very proud of the couple of weeks I had there. I played some really good tennis. After Monte Carlo, I was hoping for a bit of a clay breakthrough because I know what I'm bringing in practice. But in there, yeah, I really struggled. And so going into Madrid, I was a bit apprehensive. But then trust in my training, did all the right things and had a really good week and showed some really good tennis on the top. What does it mean to be top five in the world? Do you feel mentally as if you're a top five player now? Yeah, I think, I mean, I don't think about it in all honesty, but I think I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm playing some good consistent tennis and that's a reflection on my ranking. And I guess all the hard work that I've done over the past few years, all the little moments, little decisions, setbacks and I've really grown up a lot in terms of, I think, all areas, but I've got a lot to keep on going for. So I feel good, but at the same time, I want to keep on going. And Madrid is a tournament, I think, which would particularly suit you given the quicker conditions and the altitude. Do you think that your game can have the same impact on the clay courts of Roman Roland Garros? You know, I'm confident that I'm playing some really good tennis on any surface, any conditions. And I think that, you know, if I do all the right things, I'm going to be a tough guy to beat, so let's see how it goes. Jack Draper with a Russell Fuller. So thanks to Russell in Rome. He'll obviously keep you updated throughout that tournament. Let's switch from tennis to cricket. And Rohit Sharma has retired from Test cricket, the Indian captain, making that decision six weeks before the series against England, but he will continue to captain the 50-overside, having already retired from the T20 format. Our cricket reporter, Henry Ran, joins us now. His decision, has he been pushed? Why now? Good question. There were reports across Indian media today that suggested that the captaincy was going to be handed to somebody else. His form has been a problem, no question about it. Last three series, he's barely been averaging double figures. And so, yeah, he's a guy who is up there, and the very upper reaches and a history of recent Indian cricket. But his form just hasn't been there. Let's not forget that at the back end of the tour to Australia, he actually dropped himself from the final Test match. And so, I think he possibly realises that he wasn't going to get the opportunity to lead the side, and as soon as that was the case, it was always likely that he would step away from playing Test match cricket. Now, it's an interesting one, this, because who's going to replace him? Is it going to be Jasper Bumrar, a bowler who has captained before, but equally, fast bowlers are a little more susceptible to injuries as Bumrar has been lately. I think more likely is going to be them looking towards a new generation of players and a captain that can lead for the coming years. Somebody like Shun Mungill feels a lot more likely. But certainly this close to a tour and a major Test tour is a little disruptive, I think it's fair to say. Yeah, not quite ready for the 14-year-old, are we? Not as yet. I worked out today that MS Donie was about just under 30 years younger. Older, forgive me, than the 14-year-old. But goodness me, I mean, the depth of talent in Indian cricket is astonishing, and because of the IPL, so many players have got leadership experience as well. They're not going to be short of options, that much is certain. Thank you very much, Henry. Let's go back to Paris Arsenal. Back out, they trail by a golden ill, two-nil on aggregate, a big, huge 45-minute ahead for both of these sides back to Matt and John. Yes, Arsenal have got it all to do. They've got to win this match tonight, and with the second half about to begin, they are losing one-nil, so two-nil on aggregate, just watching Lewis Enrique down there with the goal scorer Fabian Ruiz giving him a hearty pat on the back as he ran out on to the field with some final instructions, no changes at the break. So PSG, Donnaroma in goal, the excellent Donnaroma, he's been cheered here. That's the cheer for Donnaroma from the fans behind the goal to our right, and he uploads back to them to big saves from him in the first half. So Donnaroma, Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho and Mendes on the back four, Arsenal are just about to kick off here, Vettini, Dronnevers and Fabian Ruiz, then Bradley Barcala, Kavica, Kavaric Scalia and Desiree Dua. There's the whistle from Felix Zvaya, and Martin Odegaard plays the ball immediately all the way back to David Ryer, the Arsenal goalkeeper, Ryer in goal, Kimba Saliba, Kivio and Lewis Skelly, then party, Odegaard and Rice in midfield, Saka on the right, Martin Eli on the left and Mikkel Marino playing as the central striker with Kai Havertz on the injured list. Giorgio Ginho is among the substitutes, weren't necessarily expecting that, Calafiore as well, Trossard left out of the team tonight. And Matthew Upsen sitting next to me, Arsenal, an England central defender, played in the Champions League for Arsenal, watching the Arsenal captain, Odegaard who can't bring that ball down, and now Vettini is able to take it away and pass it actually behind Barcala, out under the right wing. Barcala gets the ball under control, he's got Vettini on the overlap, but he goes back to Hakimi and then Hakimi back towards the halfway line. And he's Paris Saint-Germain support as Matt, they're just going to be, this is an anxious 45 minutes watching their clocks as the cross comes over from Hakimi all the way across the Arsenal area, and counting down the time to when they can say that they've done it and they're through to the Champions League final in Munich. Yeah, I mean, such is the confidence and the work rate in this PSG team. I'm not sure if they are going to have a nervous 45 minutes done, but I think they're already a little bit in that celebratory mode, you'd feel, and the stadium's now starting to jump, they're all in unison, there's a chant going round, and I think they're just thoroughly enjoying this situation. Foul on Marino, so to free kick to Arsenal, might be interested to know, as John Cross from the Daily Mirror was telling me, you know the famous song One Nil to the Arsenal, that John says, was actually invented here in this stadium when Arsenal played PSG in the Cup Winners Cup semi-final back in 1994, it was One Nil to Arsenal at halftime, they were playing the Pet Shop Boys, Goal West, and the Arsenal fans, and there'd been a series of One Nil wins during that season in Europe, and at the time George Graham's Arsenal, and it was taken on from there. But tonight, unfortunately for Arsenal, it's One Nil to the PSG, and the free kick has taken long after that foul on Marino, but Martin Elliott's dispossessed, and Paris Saint-Germain, and the mainly blue kick with the red and blue stripe down the middle, burst away forward, Barcalat, but Saliba comes across, forward towards Rice, and back to Audicard just inside his own half, and then all the way back to Kivill, in the middle of Arsenal territory, they're playing from left to right in the second half, passing it forward again to Lewis Skelly, the teenager, as he loves to do, uses his body to hold off Chouinéves, and Arsenal with Pardi a pass forward, which is taken down by Kimba, who's in a well-advanced position, down the line to Saka, but there's Kivarets-Kaelya tackling back on Saka, and it's the Georgian for Paris Saint-Germain, who's come out with a ball against the England International. That's brilliant, that really is brilliant. I really noticed in that first half how hard he was working, and not just the hard work, when he gets there, he then engages, and he's actually a good tackler. He gets in and around the feet of Saka, who hasn't really been able to build any momentum on Arsenal's right-hand side and create as much as what you'd like from him, but I think a lot of it is down to the left-back, he's playing against his outstanding, and Kivarets-Kaelya is just as good when he gets in those defensive positions. Yes, we saw a little group of Georgians, didn't we, outside the parter prince? Just before we came into the stadium. Here, presumably, very proud of the star man, four times Georgian footballer of the year. I suspect he might win it a few more times as well. I think he's got a chance. Here's Saka through the middle, and he's leaned into by Nuno Mendes. That's no free kick. Saka's stayed down, clutching his right leg, PSG in possession, but they don't go gung-ho, they don't need to, and actually, Hakeemi says, I'm going to put this out of play. So Saka can be looked at. I didn't quite see what the issue was there. I mean, the referee hasn't bought any of these situations. I mean, he's let the game flow quite nicely, I think. I mean, there's been a little bit of contact, and maybe a few fouls that could have been given, but just look to the replay. I think Saka just got his leg caught between Mendes' legs, and that's maybe why he's just got that knock. Yeah, he's OK. They're not going to call the physio on, so he's back on his feet. Pukajos Saka, say Alexander Chefri, the UEFA president, is here. Just glanced at the little screen here. I think he's sitting next to the PSG president, Nassar Al-Khalifi. 2011, that Qatar first bought into Paris, San-Germain, and some of the managers that they've had, some of the coaches. And, you know, first and foremost, the target is to win the Champions League. They win the French League almost every year, four in a row now, 11 in the last 13 years. The Champions League is the big target. And here, Zvon Neves, winning the ball back for PSG. Then the challenge comes in, good one as well by Pardi, then puts a tackle in on Duit, and that's a sturdy challenge by Timber. It's given us a free kick to Paris, San-Germain, and Timber reacts, going down onto his knees, flops down onto the pitch with his hands in a praying tie. Yeah, looked like a foul to me. He threw himself down like a tantruming three-year-old. If I can split it out. He really did go flat on his front onto his knees. He wins a good chunk of the ball, which is why his reaction was so extreme, but I must say... He slid through. Yeah, he went straight through, and I think the referee, just for the follow-up, the ball kind of glanced off him, but the main bulk and chunk of the contact was with the player, which is why he blew for the foul. This is a free kick, not too far away from the position where PSG scored their goal in the first half. Fittinias, where didn't you take this? Michel Arteta looks anxious. Fittinias swings it in, but he's... Nothing like the delivery in the first half. Curls it into the clubs of Raya, who's able to catch it quite comfortably. Five live BBC sounds, listen as well to Moronite to hear what it sounds like in Bordeaux. Bordeaux glimped the team with the slash in their title, playing Tottenham in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final. So live from Bordeaux to Moronite, we're in Paris tonight. Sports Extra tomorrow night for the commentary on Manchester United. Here, Arsenal in possession. VE Day as well tomorrow, and you'll hear coverage of that all day on five live. As the ball bounces away off Marino and out of play, near the halfway line. Sounds right up your street a bit of Bordeaux. I can see you strolling around there enjoying the culture. I am very, very jealous of them. I would love to have been able to make that trip. Yeah. Raya, long pass from him, downfield. Saka can't keep it in, and it's out of play for a throwing to PSG. However, I think we'll cope here in the fashionable Boulogne-Bilancau area of Paris, where Kashmir is always acceptable. Just looking down the most well-heeled sit down in front of us. There's some wonderfully coiffured hair in the five or six rows that I'm looking down on. It's a lovely park. It's a lovely park. It's a lovely park. Paris, actually. It's a real sporting kind of corner, isn't it, with Longchamp as well, the racing track and all the other sporting. The party has caught in possession on the halfway line, and Arsenal have got men back and PSG. That's another part of this second half. This is so big for Paris Saint-Germain, and this is mainly a young team, and they talk about it all of the time. Whether the pressures will come into it, there's no pressure here. Nuno Mendes, pouring forward from left back, playing it across. Dewey turns and shoots go. It's opened his body, very La Mignamal-like, actually, on the other side of the penalty area. Quick play, opened his body, that steered the shot well wide, actually. Well, this PSG left side is the best in world football. It really is. I mean, the quality and the speed they have between the Mendes and Caravaj Kelya is just blistering, and that with the intelligence, the work ethic, the quality, it literally has everything, this left-hand side, and it's been such a challenging tie for Paquio Saka to get in the game, understandably, because you're up against two players that are very, very difficult to get on top of. Best left flank in world football. I think so at the moment. I don't think there's a better one. Not the half-sign this season. When Luis Enrique won the Champions League, when he was coach of Barcelona, he had Suarez and Messi and Neymar, but here's Bárcala. Bárcala carrying the ball into the area, still Bárcala puts his foot on the ball, little pass, chipped across the goal by Petina, and that's easily chested back by Timber to goalkeeper Raya. Almost ten minutes played in the second half, and I must say now it does feel as though that first 20-25 minutes of this match before Luis gave PSG the lead, and they could have scored before then as well, but I think particularly the first 20 minutes, if it doesn't go for Arsenal tonight, which it's not doing with this scoreline, that's where they've lost it. When you play as well as what they did, and you get nothing for it, it hurts, it takes a chunk out of you, you feel, and then you're dealing with the quality on the counter, and the, you know, hitting the post, and then the goal, and all of a sudden it's like a sinking feeling. So Arsenal have got to dig in deep here, they're still in this match, they have to work hard, if they can just get anything, it might just make that last piece of this game a little bit difficult for PSG. Raya long free kick, forward to the edge of the area, Marino jumps for it, but it bounces through and is cleared away to the halfway line, where Barclay is in a bit of a candle there with Lewis Skelly, who has fouled him, says referee's via, and that's a yellow card for the Arsenal teenager, Lewis Skelly. Nothing worse than when you're waiting for the ball to come down and you've got a player that's got momentum coming onto it, and he's just in a difficult position there, Lewis Skelly. He loves to just stick his body between the man and the ball, that's his go-to all the time, and Barclay read it, got round him, and then he had to pull him down. One nail to Paris Saint-Germain, two nail on aggregate, Nuno Mendes goes down, no free kick, Cavarra T'Caillier is in possession of the ball with his wispy beard and his white strapping on his wrist turns, goes down, it's taken on though by Vitinha, excellent footwork from Vitinha, still going Vitinha, and it's clipped across via a deflection, but caught by Raya stretching, what a piece of play that was by the Portuguese number 17. Cross, some twinkle toes, that one, a lovely lift at the start to lift the ball down the line over the outstretched leg of Timber, and then the footwork going into the box was really, really magical. Yes, he didn't have the best of times by any means at Wolves when he was there, he didn't play enough, he came in and spoke to us at the Emirates last week and he was talking about how looking back, that was very important and good for him, but I think the meaning there was, I didn't really enjoy it very much. He has ordered guard, forward to Saka, now Arsenal could be interested, Saka with the shot from the angle, but Nuno Mendes puts a foot out and blocks it behind, wider than the opposed, corner Arsenal though. It's almost the best outcome Arsenal could have, you know, Mendes 1v1, you're not going to get too much change out of him, but if Saka can keep winning, this set plays, if Arsenal can keep putting the ball in the box as many times as they can, probability says something's going to drop at some point. Corner then, one of Arsenal's big, big strengths. Over the course of the last couple of seasons, no Gabrielle at the moment though, one of the main dangers, however, there are still dangers there, little steps from Saka, in comes the corner and it's pushed up and over the top by Donnaroma. It was dropping in, but Donnaroma, 6'5", was able to reach up and just push it over the top of the bar, second corner. Yeah, comfortable, wasn't it? I mean, he gets too much curl in the ball there, Saka. He wants to set that a little bit further out near the 6-yard box line. Saka again then, second right-sided corner in a row, and it goes on Donnaroma, came off an Arsenal head, even though the goalkeeper went for it. Mikael Moreno's claiming that the final touch was off a PSG body, but referees via well-position says goal kick. Yeah, decent ball in and good flick, just everyone had gone into the middle of the box and nobody drifted out. Somebody just pulled onto the back post area. There was a simple header in an empty net, but there was completely empty of any player. Yeah, I think the final touch was off Timber. You can see that now. So goal kick, referee got it right. Goal kick to Paris Saint-Germain, just over half an hour to play. PSG half an hour from going to Munich. Arsenal half an hour from going out. It would be a fourth defeat out of four for Mikael Arteta in two-legged semi-finals as the Arsenal manager. How's your look? Saka bundled over by a patch hole. He's fallen off the pitch, but it is. It's a free kick to Arsenal on the right-hand side, Audegarde runs off the pitch. Arsenal just need to... whatever, however they do it, just find a way through. Find a way past Donoruma. That isn't a good decision from Paco. It doesn't need to give that foul away. Really clumsy, smashes into the back of Saka right on the touch line. He's going nowhere, now Martin Audegarde can place the ball. This is a lovely angle for him, John with his left foot, just to witness one in. The Arsenal captain with his left foot waits to deliver this. He has created three goals in the last four matches. Audegarde plays it in, Donoruma comes, gets a good punch on that. Well out of the penalty area. Barcala just heads it back to Fabian Ruiz, the scorer of the only goal tonight. The man who scored the goal in the first leg, Usman Dembele, only on the bench for PSG this evening, the 33-goal top scorer, but they've not needed him so far as Timber on the right wing wins it. The throw-in, Arsenal are building a little bit of pressure here. Timber wins the throw-in, just looking to see if party is going to come and take the long one, but he's not. Maybe just a little too far up behind. I think he is. Oh no, here he is, he is coming. They have to. And also they have caused problems with it. They have to, I mean, in open play at the moment it's hard to see where the goals are going to come from with Arsenal. I mean that has been a big problem that there's this season, but they have a chance with these long throws. Here it goes, we're right behind the line of it. The throw is headed away on the edge of the box. Saliba though is able to steer it back out to party. Party beats the jumping Douay, then plays it back to the edge of the area. Timber back to party, party right for it across the box, but right into the path of Pat Cho, who is able to clear away for Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal come again. Saliba's crossed this time right away to the far side of the penalty area. Marino backing away, turns. Oh, and he's got it all wrong. He's past it behind Martin Elliott all the way through for a goal kick. And you can hear what that's done to the PSG supporters who like us, we're watching. Arsenal have a spell there, but it's gone. And what was it like? It was again, it was really good foundations, good movement, technique, all the rest, but without that final piece at the end. And until they find that somewhere, PSG are going to feel relatively comfortable, because while they might have those moments where they're under pressure, I don't think they really feel massively threatened that Arsenal are going to score. No. It feels now like it's not going to go Arsenal's way, but I've sat and watched enough surprise turnarounds in my life to not give this one up just yet. And it is incredible how it can change, and the mood of a match can change so quickly. But I'm not stacking my house on this happening tonight. Here is Hakimi playing the ball out to the far side. Shroud Nevers, that's a heavy touch from him, out of play for a throw. Miles Lewis-Skelly takes this, pulls it down the line, this is from Artinelli to Chase, and the cross comes Marquinhos to put it out of play. Marquinhos was one of the goal scorers when PSG won their only previous victory in a Champions League semi-final. And if you remember, that was back in the Covid year, in 2020, when it was a one-off semi-final against Leipzig. So PSG have never won a two-legged Champions League semi-final. That's what they're trying to do tonight. Last season they lost both legs 1-0. This season they're winning both legs 1-0. Long throttle for party. Bounces out to the edge of the penalty area, Timber couldn't get there. Dua is barged off the ball by Odegard, I'm surprised that wasn't given as a free kick. Fabian Ruiz has been able to clear it away downfield. Saliba's got to be careful. Saliba might be in danger of losing out there. That might be in danger of losing out to Barcala, but in the end he's managed to draw the foul from Barcala. They don't like it in the stands of the Parc de Prince, but Arsenal now already the urgency is there. Quick free kick, played forward, Rice gets it back, Rice's ball across, deflected right across. Beyond the far post, Saka, dropped behind it. Saka, then back to Timber. Timber gives it back to Saka. Saka now onto his left foot, curls it, go, it's off! What a save again from Donorama. I thought that was bound for the top corner. I thought that was beating the big man, but he threw out one of those arms, fingertips again, round the top corner. Oh, what a save. And what a hit from Saka. We've been asking for an Arsenal player to produce something a bit special. That was it from Bacchio Saka. For the first time in the game, he gets himself a couple of yards away from Mendes. He whips it with his left foot, and what a fingertips save. With the right hand from Donorama, he's gone in the top corner. Rice with the corner, deep to the back post. Pardi tried to get there, Defendo's in the way, comes out to Saka, goes down, threw himself down, Clarence Galea tells him what he thinks of him. Meanwhile, PSG are off on the counterattack. It's Hakimi who's taking the ball down the left wing, but they're not going gung-ho, duee, though, so says, give it to me. And then he gives it back to Hakimi, and Hakimi shoots, and Raya's able to go down to his right. Took a little deflection that Raya was able to feel that down to his right. Yeah, gave it the ball a nasty little bit of movement there, didn't it? You know, one of those ones that you can see squirm under the arms of goalkeepers. They did quite well there, Dabin Raya, to get solid forearms behind that ball. It was a tricky save, but, you know, PSG, for that breakaway there, John, like you mentioned, they didn't really go for the throat, did they? There's a feeling now that we're comfortable. You know, we've got two goals, we're in control. If we can break forward, then great, but if not, no problem. We'll just keep the ball and run the time down. Patchall steps forward, stabs it away. William Patchall, the Ecuadorian central defender. He's good, isn't he? 23 years old. Arsenal again in possession on the left-hand side. Saka, the latest to have been denied by Donnarumma. Saka must be thinking what do I have to do to beat Donnarumma. Remember the Euros final. And here he is now. He's popped up on the left-hand side, Bucayo Saka trying to come in field, but well defended. Excellent midfield play from Shroud Neves, who got in there, won the ball against Saka. Then he's felled by Moreno. The referee's just simply to go to the streets. Suggesting that he is going to be called to the screen. Yeah. What was that about? And there is a potential penalty check. So this, I guess, well, it would have to be for an Arsenal penalty because the ball's not been in the PSG penalty yet. Surely not the Saka swan dive that we've got. We brushed that off as if it was a... Well, and you know what this means? Usually, when the referee is called across by the VAR, who is Bastien Dankert, it's a handball against Arsenal. Oh! It was when Hakini went for goal. It was when Hakini shot for goal, and it did say deflected off Lewis Skelly. And a penalty has been awarded by Felix Zvaya. Wow. And Miles Lewis Skelly was twisting his body. And I think he's a little unfortunate there for that to be given as a handball against him. I would say a little unfortunate. His hand is just... The arm is at right angles. Yeah, but... I mean, he's twisted his body. But, you know, in Europe, with Miles off being reasonable with these handball situations, you know, the Premier League's gone so far in actually applying a little bit of rationale and common sense to the situation that the player's in. There's no thought for the situation that Lewis Skelly's in. Is his arm away from his body? Yes. But he's trying to break, change direction, and block a shot at the same time. Your arms are not going to be down your side like a penguin. So they're going to be free-flowing in that natural movement. He smashes the ball from two yards away from him. How on earth is he supposed to get his arm or hand out the way? And to get penalised, very similar to the game away into the Arsenal had in the Champions League this year. A ridiculous handball. Marina, that one. This is just another one. And it's needless. I mean, for VAR to call that back, to think that there's a clear and obvious error from the referee in that decision, I find ludicrous. I think it's a total misuse of what VAR is there for. It's the kind of decision that is given in European competitions. Yeah, but it's ridiculous. And if the referee gives it on field even, I would be upset with it. But for the VAR to bring it back and say there's a clear problem here, it's just ridiculous. Well, Arsenal need David Ryer here. Remember his penalty save against Atalanta in the league phase of the competition. Brilliant double save from Retege. Well, he's going to face Vittinia, the little Portuguese midfielder. So it's a penalty. Arsenal have made a change. Trossard has come on and Califiori. So Louis Skelly and Martin Elliott have been substituted. Meanwhile, here is the moment that could clinch it for Paris Saint-Germain. Vittinia stands right behind the ball on the edge of the area. Little steps forward, a crouching motion. He walks up to the ball and then... Ryer saves it down to his left. Pushes it away. Not the most firmly hit penalty you've ever seen. I think he was hoping that Ryer was going to commit himself, but Ryer keeps it out and it's still 1-0 on the night. 2-0 on aggregate and Arsenal are still just about alive. Wow, that was a bizarre approach to the ball. It was like he was trying to creep up on it, John. Tiptoeing. I almost felt like saying, you go down to the woods to get it. It had that feel. It was a really poor penalty. I don't quite know what that was, but there's no power. You've got no momentum coming into the ball because you're creeping up on it. And then no power, and David Ryer holds his nerve really well, actually. He's in the corner, so he has to really get across to his left-hand side, but good save. Arsenal have changed their left flank, and now Dan Bale is on. Booseman Dan Bale coming on for the last 20 minutes. Went off injured, the man who scored the goal in the first leg. The top scorer, 33 goals this season. 28 in his last 28 appearances. That's not bad. And it's a PSG corner after the Ryer penalty save. And corner from the right-hand side. One nil on the night, two nil on aggregate. PSG going through. Here is the corner, but Oda the near post headed away for Arsenal. And then nodded to the man who's just had his penalty save, Vettini, who, with his right foot, brings Dan Bale into the game for the first time. And then he's a throwing off Timber. So Barca making way for Dan Bale. So I think if that had gone in, I think you'd have heard that all around Paris, the cheer, outside the ground, but instead, David Ryer has kept Arsenal in it. And as you said, Matt, you do feel for Arsenal and Lewis Skelly being pulled up for that. But here's Calafiori back from injury, not played in the last 10 matches. Calafiori into the penalty area, but overruns it. And PSG are able to clear it away and actually might be able to break away up the right-hand side. So with Barca being substituted, Douay was over there on the right-hand side. Hakimi's now bursting forward as well. Douay turns on the edge of the box. That was well defended though for Arsenal by Saliba, who passes it to Crossard, who's onto the field now. Crossard having started the last four matches, but on the substitutes bench tonight, back to party, time now very much beginning to run out for Arsenal. We're in the last 20 minutes, 71 minutes play. Arsenal with Bukai Osaka, who forced the best save of the second half from Donorumma. He's in contention to be man of the match again. The PSG goalkeeper into the centre-circle. It is with Kibyo. He's given it away past it behind Oda Gard, so Kibara Tsukeliya was able to pick up possession of the ball and now glides forward in that way that he does the Georgia number seven and then pulls it back to the edge of the box, not cleared by party. Hakimi! Right foot, bottom corner! The right back has clinched it, surely, for Paris Saint-Germain. That's finished the semi-final. Surely it has, and it's finished off Arsenal as well. Nikolaj Tepa stands with his arms crossed. Two-nil on the night, three-nil on aggregate. PSG are bound for Munich. Wow, this place has just erupted. They know they're home and dry. And Arsenal are out of this game. The body language, the dejected look on the players says it all. I mean, it was a tired piece of defending, and Arsenal have put so much into this game. They really have. They've run their socks off, and PSG now in a position where they can just exploit those little holes. And it's Hakimi with a lovely sweeping right foot, with finish, it really is a well-taken goal. Krabats-Kaliya gets the ball wide. Arsenal don't quite deal with it, and then it's a bit tired. Kibyo doesn't get out to the ball. Saliba's a little bit deep, and it just allows Hakimi, the space and time, 18 yards out, to wrap his foot round. And what he does, he rips it beautifully around Saliba, and it nestles right in the bottom of the far corner, just hits the inside, grazes the inside of the side netting, probably about two or three inches inside the post. Beautiful finish with his right foot. And Luis Enrique with a two-nil lead on the night, three-nil on aggregate. Luis Enrique immediately says, right, let's be having one of those forwards off, two a's off. And Lucas Hernandez, the French international, is coming on, the number 21. So he's playing on the left-hand side of the defence, which I guess means, what, three central defenders now for PSG? No-no-mendes playing as the left wing back. Yeah, you think that probably looks the luck he's set up for. Or indeed, no-no-mendes just playing further forward. Yeah, I think he's gone further forward in that position, and Hernandez will go to the left back. But, you know, what a scoreline to keep a clean sheet at the moment against Arsenal. I mean, Donnarumma has been hugely influential in that, but Paris, in full control of this tie now, and the supporters are just enjoying themselves. Yeah, and again, it's not a new conversation. We'll be talking about Arsenal and it being another one of those games where they couldn't find the goals that they needed. That's, you know, the draws that they've had in the Premier League. 13 draws in the Premier League this season. Yeah, I mean, you've got no centre-forward on the pitch, and, you know, Martinelli's not in a big goal-scoring form. Saka weighs in with his... A good haul of goals most season, but, you know, they have to work incredibly hard and get incredibly creative in order to get that goal tally up. And, you know, there's been a few little mistakes starting to creep in as well. They've conceded a lot from set plays in the last 10 games, and Saliba's making a few little errors with the ball, and just a few things that have crept into the game that have added to this situation, but, you know, it's been a difficult season for Arsenal, and this game is maybe just that one game too far after brilliant performances against Madrid. So 2-0 on the night, Fabian Ruiz in the first half, and the excellent Atra Hakini, the former Real Madrid and Inter man. Yeah. So up against his former club, and the final he will be, and he's produced some great moments, as Trossard wins the ball back from Marquinhos, and here's Saka, Saka's in, and Saka scores! And Arsenal have got a goal back with 15 minutes to play. Marquinhos is saying that he was fouled by Trossard, referee's not interested, and Saka finally has been able to get the ball in the net past Donnarumma. 2-1 on the night now, 3-1 on aggregate. From where I'm sat, I think the referee makes an excellent call. It's a gutsy call as well, because everything's screaming to say this is a foul, but for me, Marquinhos, he knows Trossard's behind him, and he just puts the brakes on and then falls on top of the ball. Like so many players do, and the referee just instantly gives a foul, and he doesn't, because he reads it and thinks, well, you're trying to buy that foul, is there contact in a bit of a shove from Trossard? Yes, there is, but not enough to fall over. He thinks he can just fall on the ball, and the referee will give him the foul, and he doesn't. Then it just ends up in the box. There's loads of movement. Saka's running across. Donnarumma gets the save, or a block, or maybe it was a Hakimi, and then it's a simple tapping just from three yards out into an empty net for Saka, and Arsenal are on the score sheet. 2-1 on the night, 3-1 on aggregate. There was a very handy deflection, actually, from the Trossard pass-off, Pacho, which took it to Saka with Donnarumma going down. Here's another ball in, and Saka in the middle couldn't get his head to it, as Lucas Hernandez actually came across. And suddenly, there's a little bit of concern here in the PSG defence. Donnarumma coming out, and he's asking questions. He's saying, what's going on here? You know, they very nearly had another goal there, Arsenal. He's losing his rag with Gaviraj Kailia. He really has had a go at him, and he's kind of pointed to himself going, what me? Donnarumma's going, yeah, you. He wasn't happy with the intensity in which he got after the ball and stopped Arsenal developing something down the left-hand side. So Bukajosaka means Arsenal are on the board, as Jhvn Nevers fires the ball forward, but the referee's going to bring it back for the PSG free-kick half-inside their own half. So Bukajosaka becomes the first Arsenal player to score in a semi-final since Nicolas Pepe scored with a penalty against Villarreal in 2021 in the Europa League semi-final. So that run of six semi-final matches without scoring a goal, that is all about. However, I think the phrase that we'll probably use is too little, too late. Well, you did say earlier... Still got 12 minutes to play. You said earlier that these games can turn quickly. And PSG have given it away, and Reiss now to Odegard, and Odegard with a flick into the path of Patro of PSG, who's able to just belt it away to the halfway line. That's a good situation. They turned the ball over in a really dangerous area. Martin Odegard tried to clever little back heel flick through, and Pacho, who has just covered that back line so well, he's such a tough player to get around. He just seems to read the line of the ball and get blocks, stops a little pathways through. There are jitters here for PSG. Saka's now playing centrally, and here they come again. Trossard, Trossard, back towards the halfway line. You know, this is the pressure. These are the nerves jangling at a team that, you know, a few moments ago, thought the job was done. Saka, oh, the chance! Saka's put it over the bar. Kala Fiori's crossed. Donnaruma came for it, didn't get there, and behind him, Saka couldn't direct the shot under the crossbar. Open goal over the top. I can't believe he's missed it. He can't believe he's missed it. Sat on the floor with his hands on top of his head, he knows. This was a massive chance. I mean, he's just got to take the pace off it a little bit and get his upper body over the ball and caress it. Any kind of touch that's underneath the crossbars in the back of the net is flashed across. Brilliant ball in. Donnaruma's at full stretch. He doesn't get there. It goes past the goalkeeper. Saka arrives. He's been in that area, like you said, centrally or in the back post every time the play's developing down the left, and he just can't keep the effort down under the crossbars. It'd just be in the back of the net, and wow, that would set up the last 10, 15 minutes of this game brilliantly. The Jitters are on here for Paris Saint-Germain. Yes. And there in the space of maybe two or three minutes, Arsenal scored one and could have scored two more. Here's Timber. Timber coming forward, gets up, loses out. Nuno Mendes is going to play the ball out to Cavarra-Tecalier, who's over there on the right-hand side. Hakini's making a run through the middle again. That's typical, then. Cavarra-Tecalier, though, keeps running, and then finds the pass to Fabian Ruiz, and then Dembale with a shot. Raya's able to, period, push it away back into the penalty area, comes back to Dembale, and then there's a foul on Xhwau Neves, centrally by Marino. We saw the waving of the imaginary yellow card from little Neves when he was sitting on the ground. It's a free kick, no more than that. Well, that needs a yellow card for him, then, doesn't it? It should be, anyway. I mean, the big difference in this game, when Paris come forward like that, you feel like they're manufacturing slicker, better goalscoring opportunities than what Arsenal have done. They're getting these wide players on the ball, whichever ones have mixed up the movements all into changing, but then once they get their one or two passes off, they really do create a good bit of space and good opportunity, and their clinical edge has been good in this game. Five lives from the BBC. We're live here at the Parc de France. That's Matthew Upson. A little later on, we will, on BBC One, have the highlights, Champions League match of the day, the highlights of this match and tomorrow, last night, and they'll be on the iPlayer as well after 10 o'clock, so you can find the Champions League highlights there. And a free kick for Paris Saint-Germain, which is taken short, and then the shot is squeezed in from probably 35 yards, and passed by Vettini as a hechini. They hit it well enough, but it was pulled away, left of the goal and behind for a goal kick. Ben White's going to come on as well for Arsenal very shortly, and Timber probably did well to make this. And Nicolò Teth is frustrated, because he wanted to make the substitution there. Arsenal through the middle, Marino, here's Declan Rice, Declan Rice had a little look there, he's onside, the cross hits, Nuno Mendes, then back to Timber, now Declan Rice again, Rice a packed penalty area, Saliba to party, now Audegarde, Audegarde holds off Nuno Mendes, and then the ball bounces away from Declan Rice, and Nuno Mendes is able to bring it forward and then hit a long crossfield pass, that's for Hakimi to chase, his energy is incredible, but he overhits that out of play, and it's a throw in the last night. That was a steam train in the up and down the right, I mean, one minute he's back, and then he's halfway up the pitch, and then he's back again, I mean, he gets everywhere. He was telling us yesterday about his nutritionist, Hakimi. He's obviously feeding him the right stuff. Yeah, what's he eating, John? Well, he didn't kill us. Disclose. No, it's full of whatever it needs to be. Raya, long downfield over the top of Saka, then Audegarde on the challenge with Vettini, we've got the chaos that Arsenal needed, but TSG have got the lead that they need. Two-one on the night, three-one on aggregate. Well, Arsenal had the chance as well, though, didn't they? I mean, that from Saka should be in the back of the net. He should have two goals in this game, and also Donnarama, the save he made from him with his left foot was absolutely outstanding. They've had their chances, Arsenal, in fairness. I mean, you have to take your hat off to the way they've gone about the game. Six minutes to play. Plus added time. Arsenal somehow have got to come up with two goals without reply. Paul has deflected out for a PSG throw. So, Timberwos, replaced by Ben White. So, White now operating at right back. And Arsenal with Saliba in possession. Long and forward from Calafiori. It's a long one. This is for Trossard to chase Marquinhos. Comes out with the ball, excellently defended by the PSG captain, the Brazilian captain as well. Hakini then allows Jair Neves to find Dembele. And Dembele's first-time pass will run to Hakini. Hakini right side of the box. Arsenal have got men back. Kvaratskjelja, though, in the area. It's now very congested in there, as Kvaratskjelja takes it back out into the left-back area. And is being followed all the way out there by Saliba. He's trying to draw the foul. He's taking it towards the corner flag. Then he goes down. And then the ball has actually run for Jair Neves. Kvaratskjelja again has got Saliba all over him. The two of them fall off the pitch together. Calafiori it is. And actually, it's just a goal kick that's been given as they square up to one another. Calafiori and the assistant has actually come onto the field to stand between them. And it's a yellow card for Calafiori and also a yellow card for Kvaratskjelja. You can't square up in that fashion. I mean, the linesman is acting as a bouncer, trying to get his arm between him. He's that boxing referee. They really are squaring up and the referee comes over and gets the yellow card out for both players as it's just boiled over a little bit. Less than five minutes between Paris Saint-Germain and a second Champions League final. They reached that final, the Covid final in Lisbon against Bayern Munich, Hansi Flix Bayern Munich. There's a foul centre-field on Saka. I think it was dissent that from Saka. He felt that he was fouled and got up and he really let the referee have it. So frustration for Saka. He said something to the referee. So a free yellow card for Bukajosakar in a free kick. And Marquinhos down there, Marquinhos. They can see him saying to Patio and to Vettini. Just take as long as you can over this. More substitutes have been beckoned forward, called forward by Luis Enrique. Who is the champion of the final? Yes, it's Thomas Tuchel's PSG that lost in that Champions League final against Hansi Flix, Bayern Munich and Lisbon in 2020. They've had some of the managers who've come through and tried to do what Luis Enrique might be able to do next month. And Chalotti, Laurent Blanc was here for a long time. Unai Emery, of course, mentioned Thomas Tuchel who got to the final, Richard Pocciettino. And Christoph Gaultier was the most recent coach before Luis Enrique to Kovac. And it really looks as though Luis Enrique has got everything for this PSG, for this club pointing in the right direction. And it might well be enough to see them all the way to lifting the trophy, but as we know, Inter are going to be tough, tough opponents within Zaghi. Arsenal come forward again, needing two goals without reply. Just to take this to extra time. Consolo Ramos is going to be that substitute for Portuguese striker. 15 goals from him this season. We saw him score against Manchester City, the clincher, didn't we? In the league stage, that important victory when they came from 2-0 down. That was when they were in danger of going out to the Champions League, remember, PSG? I mean, unbelievable. Was it 15? They finished in the league phase. To them being in this situation where your moments away from making the final just shows you the journey this team has been on this season. They're just a different team to what they were in October, November, and they're now a force to be reckoned with. Nuno Mendes is off, so Consolo Ramos is on. Long throw for Arsenal, again, party, but that's headed back out, and he gets that down. He has to cross in towards the back post. Ben White gets up with the header, but Lucas Hernandez did his job, there's high-fives all around, then White could only have it wide and behind, and it's a gold kick to PSG. And Pat Cho says to the PSG supporters, get on your feet, and they do. All around the stadium, the two tiers under this immense concrete roof above our heads. They're on their feet, they've got their red, blue and white scarves, they're twirling them, they're singing their Paris Saint-Germain songs, they're nearly there, just over a minute to play, just over a minute to go. Donnarumma, one of the men of the night, if not the man of the match. Donnarumma takes this gold kick, which comes off Consolo Ramos's head, now is out of play. Nicolette says, come on, let's get that ball back. They're not giving it up yet, of course. Need two goals without reply, just to take this to extra time. Urega jumps with Vittini, but it bounces down for Fabian Ruiz, he scored the opening goal tonight. Now, Cavarietta Caglia, carrying the ball out towards the right-hand side. I wouldn't be surprised that he just keeps going with it down that right wing, he does, Rice is there, Calafiore puts in the challenge, takes the ball away from... Cavarietta Caglia gets up and roars to the crowd to make some noise over in that section as well. Cavarietta Caglia signed from Napoli in January, who might well win the Italian League ahead of Inter by the time we get to the Champions League final. I wonder if that means that he'll get two League championships... ..winning medals this season. Five minutes of added time, time running out for Arsenal and for Michela Arteta. It would be some League season if you've got two championship-winning medals and the Champions League winning medals. France, Italy and the Champions League. That wouldn't be bad. And they've got to go off to the FIFA Club World Cup, and they've got to go off to the course as well. In the summer there, one of the teams that are in that, they're in a group with Atletico Madrid, Seattle Sanders and Botter Falgo. So we are into those five minutes of added time. And PSG, playing the ball back towards the edge of the area. Again, if you just switched on tonight, the first 20 minutes tonight of the second leg were absolutely crucial. Arsenal play were excellent in that spell, they couldn't get the goal, they couldn't find the goal to bring the tie back level. And Fabian Ruiz was able to sweep in a magnificent shot from the edge of the area to make it 1-0 on the night. That became 2-0 Hakimi's goal. Bukai Osaka got one back, but Arsenal now just minutes away from going out at the semi-final stage. It's a second semi-final defeat of the season after Newcastle in the Carabao Cup. Ben White now into the penalty area. Ben White's cross, Glantz by Marino, but wider the far post with his head. Ten yards out, behind, goal kick, PSG. And Arsenal's players out there, the body language, just tell you that they know the game is nearly up. Yeah, three players arriving in the box, because he checked onto his left foot there, Ben White, their momentum is then stationary when the ball comes in, and they can't get any power or purchase on the header to really trouble Donnarama and it ends up being a bit of a glancing flick from Marino. It goes harmlessly wide, and they just haven't quite made enough of those situations they've got in this evening, Arsenal, certainly around when this cross has come into the box. Five-life sport will be on air tonight. Until half-bast 10, we'll try and bring you some reaction from Nicola Teta before 10.30, if not, it'll be on the Champions League debrief on the football daily feed on BBC Sound. Here's Declan Rice. Declan Rice in comes the challenge on him from Patio, then back to party, Oregard on the right flank, down near the corner flag. Oregard back to Ben White, puts his foot on the ball, infield towards Thomas Party, then back towards Saliva. Oregard, Oregard away from Lucas Hernandez. And then Thomas Party, then to the edge of the area, Declan Rice, the man against Real Madrid. And here's Trossard now who finds some space, and Trossard shoots, puts that block inside the penalty area by Schuau Neves. And now it goes for a throw-in over on the left-hand side. That Arsenal will take with just over two minutes of added time to play. Arsenal have to score twice. Kibios now up there as well. Kibios won the throw-in over on the far side. A throw-in party to take this. Right up against the hoardings. Here's the long throw for Arsenal. Into the penalty area, a little flick. Then it's poked by Trossard, but it just ran away, dribbled away from him. And Donnaroma just follows the ball and then flops down on it. And then climbs to his feet. Marino turns away, frustratedly. And I'll make it, we've got 90 seconds left, Matt. Yeah, I think Thomas Party's arms might be a bit sore tomorrow from the amount of throw-ins that he's had to sling into the PSG box to try and cause a bit of chaos. It hasn't quite had the effect where anything has dropped bar in that opening 15 minutes, and you've already alluded to it, John. It was crucial that something landed for Arsenal in that period and it would have been possibly a different story. Yes, the high-high for Arsenal. It was the quarter-final against Real Madrid. They're going out to this excellent Paris Saint-Germain team that Louis-Enrique has moulded. This is second season, already French champions. And it looks as though in the next few seconds the whistle will go and send them to the Champions League final in Munich later this month. Donnaroma long and downfield. Raya's able to bring that down. 2-1 on the night, 3-1 on aggregate. Saliba, perhaps the final attack. We're in the last 30 seconds now. Here's one for Saka to chase into the area. Saka across, but Marquinhos also is able to win the ball, win the race to it against Merino, and he plonks it out of play down in front of us, looking down the stand here in front of us, all of the PSG supporters. Thousands of them now, all around the Parc de France with their scarves in the air. They're nearly there. Arsenal heading out, Thomas Parti with the long-thrill. I think this will be the last action of the match. In comes the thrill. There's the clearance from Petitna. There's the final whistle. And Paris Saint-Germain have knocked out Arsenal in the semifinals. Paris Saint-Germain are going to Munich. Arsenal are out. These two clubs with their big dreams of winning the Champions League. Well, not this year for Michel Arteta and Arsenal. And Luis Enrique. Luis Enrique is surrounded by his coaching staff. Luis Enrique, already a Champions League winner with Barcelona. Now he'll try and do what so many before him have failed to do with Paris Saint-Germain. He's got Inter and Filippo and Zaghi to get past in three weeks' time in the final. What a final that should be. But Arsenal players standing with hands on hips, looking at the turf just like 16 years ago. Last time they were in a Champions League semi-final, it's ended in defeat. Two-one on the night, three-one on aggregate. Yeah, difficult to take for Arsenal. Another semi-final that they end up losing is becoming a little bit of a habit, which isn't great. But what I will say, John, is I think that you have to look at the performance and the way that Arsenal approached this game. And there's a lot of positives about how they went about it. They didn't get the desired result. Donnarama pulled brilliant saves at key moments where they really needed to score a goal. And it just didn't happen for them in this game. But PSG, for me, of all the Champions League teams I've seen this season, they're in a special moment here at this club. And I think there's a real feeling for me that this is going to be their time. Yep, much more on that very subject, I'm sure, after 10 o'clock. But we've got wild scenes of celebration here at the end of a semi-final. It's so tough for the losers, Arsenal's players going across to their fans in the corner. And that PSG theme go west, blaring out inside the stadium. The Arsenal song, but it's Paris Saint-Germain's night. Two-one on the night, three-one on aggregate. Paris Saint-Germain are in the final. Mickaël Arteta going round the Paris Saint-Germain players and shaking them by their hands. Of course, Mickaël Arteta, a man who has played for Paris Saint-Germain as well. So he's shaking the hands of some of the Paris Saint-Germain staff in Dignitaries who were on the pitch as well. And they are celebrating as a group, aren't they, John? That Paris Saint-Germain squad, backroom staff, they're in a circle and dancing together at the moment. And that's exactly it. And we've said this time and again about this Paris Saint-Germain squad, this team at the moment under Louis Enrique. The big difference is that's exactly what they are. They're all celebrating together there. They are a unit, they're a team, and that's often been the downfall in the past. But this is different PSG and this might be the year for them. And you describe them as being in a moment, Matt. And look, well, back on the game after 10 o'clock, we'll certainly look at it from an Arsenal point of view as well. But they are in a moment at Paris Saint-Germain and they are enjoyable to watch for all sorts of different reasons. Yeah, I completely agree, Chappers, that they're an outstanding team to watch. I will say there's so many interesting things about them, but the one thing that stands out the most for me is that Louis Enrique has got a team that works incredibly hard for each other. And they've got an energy level and a speed about them, certainly in wide areas, that is just so hard to handle. And they put it all together, I think they're demanding a lot from each other, and they've grown so quickly as a team together that it's just really, you know, they're night and day for what they were at the start of the season. I think they... Yeah, it's baffling. I think we've struggled to find five positives about them, say, in October, to be honest with you. But then, since then, they have pace, they have energy, they have stamina, they put their bodies on the line, they've got some of the most skillful players in Europe, they've got some of the youngest players in Europe, they have a goalkeeper who divides opinion but seems to make four world-class saves in every Champions League knockout tie that he's in. Seems to be man of the match in virtually every Champions League. Yeah, and yet people question, I mean, the contrast from October to now is, I mean, it's not much of a different clock. They're actually now going, Mark, the PSG squad altogether, they've gone to the other end, which is to our left, that's where the all the Ultras are. There's no one's left there, and there are dozens of red flares burning away in the top tier, and they're all together celebrating, hand in hand, running towards those supporters. There are probably about 200 photographers as well behind the goal in the area between the goal and the pitch and the stand, and the flag still waving, what a sight it is. I think also, Chappers, touching on that speed of how quickly they've kind of transformed into this Champions League finalist team, you have to look at the manager, don't you? And you have to think, wow, the messages that he must have got across in such a short period of time, credit to him because he's influenced this group of players massively. Lots to talk about ahead of the Champions League final. It's going to be Luis Enrique and Simone Insargi, Paris, Ajaman against Inter, at the end of May, that will be the 2025 Champions League final. Plenty of discussion and reaction to come until half past 10, just in the tennis, by the way, in the Italian Open, Emerald Ocarno threw to the second round after a three-set win against Maya, joint of Australia, earlier Katie Boulter, going out in straight sets. Exactly 10 o'clock, loss of reaction to come then, to Arsenal going out, all of the Champions League at the semi-final stage after Lisa McCormack in the BBC News.
