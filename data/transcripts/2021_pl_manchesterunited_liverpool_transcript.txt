 Anthony Taylor is the referee, he blows his whistle and the players and the coaching staff taking me To warm applause and then Anthony Taylor says right here you go off you go And Liverpool kickoff the ball is played back. Canate gets his first touch I think they picked him out there Dion to give him an early touch and he walked it away down the left hand side Yeah, he's a canate. Absolutely just calm the nerves give him a quick touch Diagonal, you enjoy this you should enjoy it maybe a few nerves, but he should enjoy this occasion Van Dyke also gets the ball back and gives it to canate who Flights a ball over the top looking for the run of Jota through the middle But that bounces through to Dehaa and welcome to everyone listening around the globe on the BBC World Service They've just joined us and this is the Manchester United team unchanged from Wednesday night here to here Wanderzakha, Lindelof, McGuire and Shaw, Maktominay Fred and Bruno Fernandez, Greenwood, Ronaldo and Rashford Fred, Bruno Fernandez and Rashford were all actually injury doubts But are all okay to play and here is Fred coming across and just driving the ball out of place straight at Jurgen Klopp actually who dropped it Should have caught that. Poor drop that from Klopp A drop from Klopp who named this team Alisson in goal Alexander Arnold, Canate, Van Dyke and Robertson, Henderson, Katerin Milner, Salah Tamino and Jota Liverpool unbeaten this season Unbeaten in 12 matches in all competitions this season and 21 in all if you stretch back into last season and very good winners in Madrid against the Spanish champions on Wednesday Manchester United sending the ball forward Lindelof but Canate comes across then Greenwood is onto it through to Bruno Fernandez then a little touch from Rashford trying to give it back to Bruno Fernandez Appeals for handball it was Kater who came across and blocked the intended pass from Marcus Rashford and Liverpool go back To the edge of their own penalty area so no Fabinho You've just joined us as indeed the World Service listeners will have 28 yesterday But a knock on the knee means he's not able to be involved and that means the gyms Milner is there again Dion the great dependable 35 years old which is fifth consecutive start this for the 35 year old Yeah, it doesn't surprise me with the game of this magnitude He knows the game has been in these games many many times before He knows the role that he has to play as a leader is dependable He always gives you eight out of ten. So yeah, I don't think that's a bad choice whatsoever So it is no no And it is Liverpool who've got the ball on the right-hand side They can't keep it in canate tried to get there the pass forward from Alexander-Arnold So Manchester United with a throw inside their own half Cannot see an empty seat around the place. It's the host ticket today No question about that all this weekend Grace Guise above with occasionally had sunshine. It was raining heavily in Manchester earlier as Greenwood plays the ball back to Lindelof they will see it back to Dehaa I did enjoy Bastion shrunch digger earlier in the program talking about how David Dehaa always used to ask him if he was as good as Manuel Neuer Not sure he'd necessarily want that in the public arena Manchester United coming forward the ball played back to Greenwood now. He has Bruno Fernandez drives his shot over the top of the bar Now was that should there have been an offside flag in that my initial thought John I thought that Ronaldo was offside listen no flag went up. There was no queries from the officials Bruno Fernandez has to score there So lovely little run. It's a great little ball through as well. I think it's from Fred. He's on side Ronaldo's on side lays it into Bruno and he should really score. He's only 12 yards out United should be one up Yeah, the assistant Gary Bezic on this side spot on And Manchester United waste the first chance No, no Bruno Fernandez who started the season Well, particularly as is Manchester United Korea has been so far Bruno Fernandez with his hat trick here against Leeds United But just one goal in 11 appearances since then however, it's still being his same creative self Robertson sending a pass forward McGuire comes across chess sit down and then Lindelof will clear took a deflection for me No heads it forward John keeps it in actually on the left wing the number 20 Diogo Jota And the bench the last couple of matches came on and was heavily involved in Madrid the other evening both in the winning of the penalty and in the conceding of the penalty that never was to to Atlético Madrid for which I thought the place was going to go mad for me. No place it through the Salah. This could be dangerous Salah now to cater One-on-one scores Liverpool have an early lead here in the fifth minute this time at Salah who set it up Just a little pass to his right into the area to cater and a composed finish from him And it's Manchester United now Liverpool one that is some finish that is some start by Liverpool What a lovely ball from Salah, but some really good play down the left-hand side Jota and Milner Little triangles nice little play nice little hold-up play from Firmino Onside Salah is he's going for the center of the goal Sure has to come over from his left back spot leaves the space in the left back spot that he vacated For cater cater's going straight down the center of the pitch straight towards a penalty spot and just slides it past the keeper It's a very good finish. It's an amazing start by Liverpool Talk about space Dion Two bases all over the Manchester United to much space yet But the whole of Manchester United Defenders over to the right-hand side too close to one the sack of left sure on his own He had to come over to Salah the lesser to evil Kater going for the chance on goal, but yet listen tell defending at the back down the left-hand side Yeah, those lines that you like to draw when you're on match of the day back fours. Yeah, I mean that was it that Was a squiggle? It was a squiggle? Yes Yes, and props all over the place and now Liverpool have won the ball centerfield it's a goal scorer Kater Firmino's in left foot shot save by Deher and then the ball is cleared to the edge of the area where it hits referee Kailor Who has to stop the play and David Deher? Well, he was that he was the only man there between Liverpool and a 2-0 lead Expected Firmino to score as well. He was only eight ten yards out on the angle should have scored he put either side of the Gay up. I think he would have scored his sort of At the get Liverpool on the front for every time man United players turn their back to try and receive the ball There's a Liverpool player there closing them down Well, what a start here Manchester United nil Liverpool one Jonathan Agnews got the latest on the cricket. Yeah, we're India have lost their fifth wicket now They might not get to that 150 we're talking about 132 for five. They've lost to Jager Cole is still there though on 57 is joined by Pandia who of course play some big shots, but they're running out of time now ten balls left 132 for five As I say commentary continues five lives sports extra just like all of the matches from the 2020 World Cup digital radio BBC sounds for that for Lanka winners earlier against Bangladesh and Liverpool winning a three K ten yards inside Manchester United territory who have they've conceded already Manchester United it is it is quite an issue this leaky defense that they've got in the absence of Varan who's out injured still but Salah found space there sore easily in a central position actually came across Luke Shaw in that position exposed didn't know whether to stick or twist and he just rolled it across to Navi Kater Kater scored in Madrid now. He scored in Manchester this week. It was It was avoidable. It really was Manchester United winning it back Bruno Fernandez had the early chance for United not taken Liverpool made no mistake with theirs And here he is Kater who was praised even though he was substituted at half time in that Madrid Salah now running forward freely with the ball He's got Fred and the Tom and I decided and he goes down for free kick Jurgen Klopp's wondering why saw the rest of Liverpool certainly their supporters Here's Cristiano Ronaldo on the left-hand side. Canate comes in and upends him It goes in takes the ball away from Ronaldo Liverpool played for it Salah on the right-hand side Jotter wants it in the middle still Salah left foot shot drags it wider than the opposed gold kick Manchester United What about that from Ibrahim a canate? Hello Cristiano Yeah, he seems to take a little bit too long on the ball there Ronaldo and he wanted to play it back I think he wanted to play it back to shore but he took that second too long Canate just kicked it out from underneath his feet whether it was a free kick or not You need a reaction on your loser ball there and then Liverpool go forward again And could have quite easily scored and made it to because Yotter Sprinted about 30 40 yards down the center of the pitch to be available for Salah Salah went for gold, but he had shot her there as well so positive What a great start big wicket with you Jonathan Agnew indeed Virat Koli is the one Pakistan wanted They've been really impressive with this I mentioned those 12 Defeats to the hands of India. Well, they've got them now 133 for six with just eight balls left Thanks Jonathan and it is Saracens 49 wasps 15 Here's Milner playing it forward for Liverpool who lead by one goal to nil Yeah, Naby Kater, I think he felt I think Jürgen Klopp Felt that Kater will have Taken a blow to his morale being substituted the other evening, but he's come up with a goal here But it is now taken forward by Rashford who shoots from 22 23 yards He actually got away from Kater there, but called the shot wide Centrally as it bounce wide by three or four yards. Yes, it's 25 yards out there Marcus Rashford He's never gonna pass. He did have Bruno Fernandez to his left When he takes his shot Marcus Rashford Bruno sort of points towards his feet as if to say pay me in But he's never gonna pass there Marcus promising start this Dion in terms of entertainment Yeah, really positive Liverpool is very good so far United finding their feet still yeah, and United Oleg Anasolja said it in his pre-match comments That he wanted his team to play on the front foot. Well, it means that they They're on the front foot They've conceded in their last 13 home matches Manchester United Last clean sheet they kept here was back in April Wow All at the back with Liverpool here is Virgil van Dijk just turns to his right Liverpool continued their record of scoring in every game this season Salah on the far side Salah goes back in towards Ibrahim a Canate so he plays instead of Matt it who is on the bench 36 million pounds of air about Liverpool played for him in the in the summer 22 years old So big football in future ahead of him playing as the right-sided central defender And he's already made an impact with that challenge on Christiano Ronaldo He's not lacking confidence He's tried a couple of really difficult passes and Ronaldo's got the ball and he takes it off his foot and that physical element that he has You can see he's a good 6 4 6 5 and he seems to enjoy it And I'm not surprised being part of this Liverpool team that is winning here with that early goal from Kater He has MacTomon a chest the ball down in the center circle Fred had to come across and stretch because it bounced off MacTomon His chest is Rashford on the left-hand side He scored in both of his Manchester United appearances this season the England manager Garas Southgate is Another one of the stars in the directors box to our left your old teammate He's about 15 yards to our left as we've said spider-man is in there as well So we've got spider cam and spider-man Here's Van Dyke For what it goes to Henderson Jordan Henderson playing in the Fabinho position and then a flick from Salah out to the right-hand side Salah who scored in his last nine Liverpool appearances Which is a new Liverpool record Milne at the left-hand side and Robertson tried to thread it forward but when the sack of made the block and it's out of play for a throw Yeah, it seems very comfortable at the moment for Liverpool I know it's only early what they seem to be getting the ball and that they're able to turn And that's halfway inside Manchester United's half and needs to be a little bit more intensity From United don't allow Liverpool to turn make it more difficult for them because at the moment they're picking a pass Robertson on the left-hand side curls the ball for to the edge of the arm the quiet show come together and Kate and now Kate on the right-hand side Alexander-Anders ball across it's in It's to know for Liverpool And Jota slides it in on the edge of the six-yard box What a start for Liverpool here at Old Trafford and what a nightmare start for Ali Kona Solchar Who immediately steps forward to the edge of the coaching area with instructions might already be too late? Manchester United Nell Liverpool to and they've deserved it. They have been at it today What is it 13 minutes gone? I can see Olly on the screen in front of a shouting and balling at his players Liverpool have been sharper There's been runs going forward when the midfield players have it from Jota and Kater in there the ball goes wide is about five yards inside the box down the right-hand side Alexander-Arnold and he's got two to choose from on the far post Jota's diving in Milner's diving in Take your pick If it hadn't been Jota sliding in on his backside, it would have been Milner I mean this is a decision we're watching the replay the indecision between the captain McGuire and sure When the balls in between you and your defending one of you deal with it and then ask questions later Don't leave it for the other player deal with the situation Honestly, I mean sure and McGuire So dependable for for England together Get a self-get as I say watching the two of them But when the jitters come in football when it gets into your head and it has with Manchester United's defense That happens when there's one of the oldest shouts in football is early shout sorts it out simple as that early shout sorts it out Bruno Fernandez in the center circle and Yet again Manchester United have got to come from two nail down just like Wednesday He has Rashford into the box Rashford still going inside the penalty area, but Liverpool stand firm Van Dyke and Henderson stand firm Rashford's dispossessed and Liverpool cleared away downfield this Liverpool team this season mentioned it Every game this season the fact that they've scored at least three times in every away game this season And here at all trap at 15 minutes played they've already scored twice every chance. They're going to do it again Yeah, they look incredibly comfortable Comfortable confident there in a really nice shape as well They're in like a like a 451 leaving Firmino Furthest forward cater dropping into a five Salas dropping into that five as well down the right-hand side Well, just like in Madrid when Mark Lawrence and was with us on on Tuesday night I did say in that match when Liverpool took an early two-nil lead It is still early There's a lot of time left in this match and the match that we saw then unfolded but To nail up here inside all Trafford with less than 15 minutes to play as it was at the time You're now thinking that this could potentially be a very very damaging result for Oligana Solskjaer There's plenty of time left for both teams in this match But Manchester United have won a corner from the left-hand side Sure with the delivery looking for McGuire with a stretch bounces down the terminate rather sliced his shot and Sent it spiralling up and over the crossbar under pressure from the defender Alexander-Arnold. Yeah The next goal has to have to be scored It's it's imperative that Manchester United score the next goal in this game. They have to there's pressure there in Itself but man United have to make sure that this doesn't go to three-nil if it does there can't be any way back You know Liverpool have really deserved this lead with a positive start every players on the front foot Every time the United player gets it is under pressure The AR had a look at the Chota goal with the lanes, but I mean with the naked eye could see it was okay Yeah, his arm was outstretched, but with the change for the with the t-shirt line now He was clearly on side and actually that was one I think but you know with it as it is now that little tweak with the naked eye You could say yeah, that's good. Well, they did they did that's exactly what I think the ball from Alexander-Arnold as well He's just inside the box down the right-hand side about eight yards from the touch line And he actually pings it across the goal He has to miss out to many United players to get it to the far post. It's just the concentration on the pass Yeah, click up another assist for Trent Alexander-Arnold for that one Manchester United nil Liverpool 2 great start for Liverpool and Klopp and Serious worries for Manchester United Alexander-Arnold Liverpool still on the front foot Salah and Kate any of the edge of the box Kate are chasing it down now towards the dead ball line But it runs away and behind for a goal kick for Manchester United I suppose the only shock is that most Salah's not on the score sheet yet. Yeah, and only 17 minutes in so There's plenty of time for that one Unfortunately for Manchester United. I'm just keeping an eye on Virgil van Dijk the way he's he's talking to his Center half inexperienced center half Manchester United have lost it inside their own penalty area Lindelof tried to play it across and somehow Manchester United have been able to scrape it away clear And now Bruno Fernandez gives it to Juan Bersaca, but there's Milner tigerishly putting in the challenge But good recovery from Juan Bersaca Jota slipped over now Greenwood left-footed ball in that's headed away by Conate Bruno Fernandez gets that first on the edge of the area and then Ronaldo with a shot left side of the box But he got right underneath it and sent it sky high across the face of goal and behind and into the crowd They've got to be hitting the target there, especially someone like Ronaldo. It's just rolled out his 18 yards Maybe 15 yards on the angle. I'm expecting Ronaldo to hit the Hit the target at least can I say he's been busy? I think man United have made it that way on purpose, but he's uh, he's dealt with everything that's been thrown at him physically He's comfortable on the ball van Dijk's been chatting to for the whole of the game. We've got a stoppage now Yeah, Keita has sat down and he's got a problem with well. It looks like his right car if If what we're seeing is anything to go in by because he's using his left hand to rub his left his right cuff so Manchester United nil Liverpool 2 is the score 6-0-6 later with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton So I'll let you know when the lines are open for that match of the day have passed 10 tonight to see the pictures of this Lester's very good win 2-1 at Brentford to Sound as though they were right in that again Brentford West Ham What a good win 1-0 against Tottenham West Ham up to fourth Rangers three points clear after their 2-1 win at St. Miren Sheffield United 3-2 winners at Barnsley who've lost six league games in a row and Fullham 4-0 up at Nottingham Forest last we heard let's get more from Jonathan Agnew on India Pakistan Yeah, well India got their 150 actually they got to 151 for 7 in fact so Pakistan need a 152 to win it's a middling sort of target but lots of pressure on of course particularly in this contest Virat Kohli got 57 Richard Pant 39 and Pandia slogged a few at the end must mention the Shaheen Shahra Friede the left arm quick bowler took 3 for 31 His four overs involved very well now the pressure on Pakistan 152 to win Thank You Jonathan and it's all over with you Ian Carter in the premonition It is indeed the expected convincing win for Saracens rounded off by their eighth try coming from Ben Earl in the final move of the match converted by Owen Farrell 56-15 the final score eight tries to two four of them to Max Maylins Saracens cruising to a bonus point with Fullham still romping with you Katie Smith They are they lead for us by four goals to know with one minute of added time Left full of on the attack again through Wilson on the right-hand side But Steve Cooper's winning streak is over at Forest It's his sixth game in charge that has happened one minute left to play John Fullham lead four goals to know Rashford on the attack from Manchester United Fred then square to McTomon air Now Ronaldo with a touch to one besaqa on the right-hand side Liverpool 2-0 up the Manchester United finally putting something together here in Liverpool's defensive third, but it's all rather ponderous. I'm afraid but United sure crossing easy stooping head out by Canate just dropped to his knees no challenge then Ronaldo Greenwood back to McTomon air 30 yards out McTomon in now out to the left where it's Chester down by Bruno Fernandez and then Manchester United go back to the center circle you can hear the reaction from the home supporters whistles as well from Liverpool's fans with Manchester United in possession at Tomon air then to shore has a touch has a shot Which bounces across the face of goal and and wide of the foot of the far post as he looked at it Yeah, it was he wasn't a bad striker tall He wasn't far from the corner of the box there trying to strike across Allison there into that far corner a Couple of yards away But he was kind of forced into it sure fans are getting all uptight I can just see the view here on the screens is about a yard away Allison had it covered actually all the way Final score is Nottingham Forest nil full of four so that excellent winning run of Nottingham Forest now well and truly all back And an important and a very good win for full of as well at the towards the top end of the table Manchester United nil Liverpool to here in the Premier League and Lindelof going back to goalkeeper to here but I mean the jitters there in that Manchester United defense are there to see virtually every time it gets an into the United Defensive third. Yeah, it does the indecision and the lack of chat as well from the back four is terrible at the moment from Manchester United We had a stoppage there when Kater was holding his car and all I was looking at is Jordan Henderson talking to people It was Miller talking to his teammates. They were organizing Kater's okay by the way Salah gives it to Firmino down the right-hand side Firmino played in his 300th match for Liverpool during the week in Madrid And then Alexander-Arnold centrally to Henderson Liverpool so much crisper it seems than Manchester United Of course, they've got the confidence of a 2-0 lead here at Old Trafford One for two last season That was Jurgen Klopp's first win at Old Trafford as the Liverpool manager a slip from Milner and Ronaldo's under this down the right-hand side He chips it across but he chips it under the head of Canate who heads it away for Liverpool McTomonay then back out to the left-hand side Milner's got a problem Milner's hobbling after that slip and he's indicated it to the bench But sure now down the left-hand side But no one there on the edge of the box from Manchester United easy header away for Jota McTomonay has to slide in on Salah And the Liverpool medical it looks like a hamstring for Milner Liverpool Defending ball whipped in from the left-hand side but through to Allison and Milner has sat down on the edge of the D and Anthony Taylor waves on the medical people That look like a hamstring didn't it? He was holding his left hamstring there He had to he actually slipped over before the ball went in behind him And then Ronaldo got on the end of it and as he was trying to catch up with Ronaldo Like most players trying to catch up with Ronaldo you do a hamstring because he was going that quickly. So yeah, particularly when you're 35 Absolutely, thank you. Of course, Ronaldo's 36 But but Milner as I said to you Dion, this is his fifth consecutive start Maybe maybe one too many and so that means with no Fabinho that Curtis Jones has got to very quickly get himself ready here I saw Jürgen Klopp sending him out to to get warmed up only just coming back from an injury problem that he had on England under 21 duty and Maybe not absolutely ideal for him to get involved in the match this early, but if he's on the bench, he'll be fit Yeah, and he's a very very good player as well. You'll come in. It won't be a problem for him whatsoever Jones and enjoy the challenge Milner just getting pulled up off the turf now by the physio hobbling slightly as well But he'll want to carry on but there's no chance by the way he's walking No looking back at the goals actually on the screen that became his goal was so comfortable one-on-one It really was indecision sure I Maguire and then we see the second goal with Trent Alexander just sticking it in that corridor of uncertainty in Diego Jota's there Liverpool have dominated this first off So now be cater with his third goal of the season Jota with his fourth Liverpool 2-0 up but having to make a change now here in the 26th minute James Milner is walking off the field very very slowly and Curtis Jones Is making his comeback having Started for in a role in the Liverpool team remember before he was injured in the in the under 21 match So off he comes having missed the last couple of Liverpool matches Curtis Jones on into the midfield Manchester United nil Liverpool to BBC Radio 5 live live from old traffic I think they might be going to get another rain shower again. It seems to have darkened Floodlights have taken greater effect and now here's Alexander Arnold on the right-hand side who is charged down by Rashford and the ball bouncing around in the first few rows of the set Alex Ferguson stand on the far side of the ground Liverpool's throw It's been quite a shock from Manchester United. I say a shock It's not like this sort of thing hasn't happened to them before in fact It's already happened this week to nail down here at Old Trafford dreamwood for Manchester United Greenwood up to the edge of the penalty area United winning it back from what was a Liverpool throw on the halfway line Greenwood then curling it out to the left-hand side Rashford takes it down Bruno Fernandez is there as well Bruno Fernandez cross hits the backside of Kata and bounces away and Rashford had to be sharp there to get Get there first ahead of Salah, but he was Bruno Fernandez now back to Rashford and the Manchester United number 10 Only just recently back after that shoulder operation that he had following the Euros Fred now through to Rashford but Rashford incomes a little challenge from Kata has done really well in there as well as scoring his goal He's been a real presence in central midfield the Guinea international and the touch from him took it back to Allison Yeah, I need a bit more movement up front for Manchester United when Tom and a's got it Fred's got it They're in a line They're in a line with the Liverpool line. There's nobody dropping into that hole Bruno Fernandez needs to get into that hole He'd see more movement from Rashford on the left-hand side as well and Greenwood on the right-hand side That of course is Deon Dublin with us on five life and the World Service Golden boot winner and Like Salah and Manet a member of the Premier League 100 goals club And here is Rashford on the left-hand side Rashford now red shirts pouring forward for Manchester United But Rashford couldn't find the pass deflected back to Fred back. It goes to Rashford turns on to his left foot Alexander Arnold up against him and then cater arrived so back it goes towards Fred more centrally middle of the Liverpool half Mekotomani now to the right-hand side to one Bersaka one Bersaka being patrolled by Jota Greenwood drops the shoulder should and Allison took a deflection actually Allison diving to his right got a good sight of it good height for it as well and pushed it away and wide and behind from Manchester United yeah, that's his area there Greenwood corner of the box down the right-hand side Shifts it from his right foot to his left tries to put in that far corner good saving the end from Allison Greenwood Takes up a position show with the corner here it is towards the penalty spot That's headed away comes out for Manchester United for the nodded ball forward from Lindelof Kater was behind that But Manchester United are able to take up possession again in the center third in the field More jitters on the halfway line Liverpool win it back and then over the halfway line they go Jota Curtis Jones almost all alone in the center circle had a look over his shoulder There was no one coming and actually just slows slows the play down almost half an hour played And Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool have got Manchester United exactly where they want them Kater on the right-hand side up to Firmino Firmino Turns moves in field Jota on the edge of the day takes a touch double touch then to the left-hand side Alexander Arnold's there plays it right across The six-yard box United half clear the ball loops up Mekton may nods it away headed it straight to Liverpool now Henderson's going to have a goal which he does and sweeps the shot via a deflection Wide of the left post as he looked at it and behind and Liverpool have a corner for that Yeah, Liverpool are being very clever. They're holding the ball Back forward just playing from left to right Forcing one of the man United players to come out to squeeze them because man United have to and then they're just using the space It's been vacated by that player in lead being very very clever very well managed this side managing the game Well as well Liverpool. Yeah, they look what they are a team in prime form Alexander Arnold with the corner then for them towards the back post That's headed away on the edge of the six-yard box play lindel off fired back into the back post Firmino couldn't get a touch Bruna Fernandez was in there as well, but I think it went past both of them and through for what is given as a goal Yeah, we can just feel that frustration now can hear the frustration as well from the man United Fans get the ball forward be more positive. That's the feeling I'm getting sat here from the fans Yeah, it's a it's an unsettled sound isn't it that's coming down from the stands of old Trafford over 70,000 people here United have Simply just got to try and find a way back into this game a goal before half time Would be just what they want, but it's a sound of satisfaction coming from the Liverpool supporters in their section to our right They can be they can be they can have every confidence that their team in this form can see this through There's an upside flag up against Manchester United But it's bounce forward for Liverpool and Salah's in here and Salah shot his block by to here The angle was very very tight mind you That doesn't necessarily put Salah off and here still had to make the same Yeah, he was actually down that side that we know he likes Canate with the challenge on Rashford who's left down on the ground home supporters feel that was a foul by Canate on on Rashford Referee Taylor says no it wasn't I think these man United players know that canate is playing today Doesn't like the physical side of the game doesn't mind it at all Letting those man United players know come my side you think he might be easy this side because there's over there you're wrong I'm up for this game. That's what he's saying and so a Liverpool Well, he's had a very good game so far and now Liverpool again Jotter in the middle stretching But couldn't get there and the ball runs across the box into here's a little bit to get to it and just feel that like a back pass Yeah, that doesn't seem to be any relaxed defending from Manchester United. Everything's lost everything's the last bitch They're forcing the game out to kick the ball forward the fans and now he's giving it away But they're better than this They are better than this this Manchester United back lane we know we've seen them this this this back lane is very very familiar Yeah, yeah, it is it is and we've seen it play many many times and play very very well many times The thing about it is when you're in an atmosphere like this and you're playing for a big club like Manchester United You need those players on the pitch to calm things down Rashford in an offside position As McGuire hit the long ball downfield for him And Liverpool with a free kick half way inside their own territory Manchester United nil Liverpool to half-time approaching Just over 10 minutes away. We're gonna hear from David Moyes the former Manchester United manager who is enjoying another very good season still early days with With West Ham this season, but what a good win for them Disappointing defeat for Tottenham and we will also hear from the Leicester camp as well James Madison is going to be talking to us after he scored the the second goal for Leicester In their win at Brenford Leicester on 14 points the same as Manchester United United losing at Leicester last weekend conceded bad goals in that match as well as you'll know Greenwood now for Manchester United who win possession back Here's the ball in from Bruno Fernandez to the back post Ronaldo was underneath it Robertson just jumping got his head to it first Ahead of the great Portuguese and Glans stood behind for corner Just enough just good enough Robertson down the far post and now they were zooning that little diagonal run Bruno had the ball diagonal run diagonal ball Robertson flicks it out for corner Short to take this one from the right-hand side first one they've had from this side So it's the in swing at and the England left back Liverpool fans up there behind him plays it in rattles around on the edge of the six yard box Still not cleared McGuire heads at four another head stretch then the ball bounces down Rashford's in there comes out for sure showing on the challenge clattered together with Who kept his feet sure went down short claims for a corner referee Taylor says goal kick Liverpool Yeah, I think he gets it right as well having seen the replay a couple of times Sure's got his arms out running towards ref as if to say you've got that one wrong But I think he was gonna just flick it off Kater's legs and Katie moved out the way So it's 2-0 to Liverpool Liverpool last season that 4-2 win that was the first win for Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp here at Old Trafford Manchester United had won in the FA Cup last season That was a good game. I remember that and And they were pretty much full strength teams that played in the FA Cup tie But Oligo Nassosha yet to win a league match against Liverpool as a manager in six matches And if he gets a win out of this one, then I think the reaction will be even greater Then it was in the week when they came back to beat Atlanta Fred playing the ball through but too much on that Rashford couldn't get onto it through the middle and Liverpool coming through Bringing it out from the back again themselves, but Kate or is dispossessed and now McTominay allows it to run to Bruno Fernandez his past slightly behind Ronaldo and therefore he had to check back Ronaldo still in possession on the left-hand side Then back to Shaw Shaw into Bruno Fernandez first time volley into the area Rashford with a shot as it dropped over his shoulder Went for the spectacular and miss hit it really straight through to Allison Yeah, lovely little bit of play Ronaldo to Bruno and Bruno puts in Rashford he tries to take it first time it's coming over his right shoulder tries to volley it Which is the right thing to do because if he lets it bounce Van Dyke's there to clear it To know Liverpool League Liverpool coming forward again, it's Not while it's not been absolutely end-to-end all the time it's had plenty of that Van Dyke just forward of the center circle Uses the Scotland captain Robertson here on the left-hand side then and back it goes towards the halfway line Canate now John that it is among the substitutes and no Quavine Kellehab by the way either we Discovered before kickoff that he's been unwell this week So Adrienne is on the substitutes bench the goalkeeper for Liverpool His Curtis Jones turning on to his right foot to give it to Robertson Jürgen Klopp all in back black apart from that big red kick on the back of his coat Those big white shoes on again with the red stripes and the red laces Here's Henderson Henderson and Liverpool keeping possession they like this those supporters to our right Liverpool bossing it at Old Trafford And then back it goes to canate Mike feelings the man from Manchester United on the edge of the coaching area both played through the middle stretch to his left from Lindelof intercepts that pass But all Manchester United do is give it back to Liverpool on the halfway line Henderson now to Keita Keita who started the ball rolling with the opening goal Now for Mino this is lovely from Liverpool then jot out Salah with a snapshot that's deflected across the box now It's across it's another one. It's Salah this time. It's three nil Salah scores for a tense consecutive match and Liverpool are all over Manchester United Here at Old Trafford Oleg on a soft shot down there just stays in his seat and it's Manchester United nil Liverpool three And when nowhere near half-time even yet That is an incredible That is an incredible passage of football there from Liverpool one tunes Flicks round the corners little round the corner watching the replay here for Mino and Salah into Jota And then ricochet is out to Keita The thing that I noticed there is that most Salah is being marked by McGuire and sure The ball ricochets out wide to Keita Salah goes by those two defenders and wants to get there first He does he scores deserves to score Liverpool have been outstanding man United aren't even out on the pitch yet Manchester United nil Liverpool three three nil to your fiercest rivals On your home tour And surely even though we've got Well over half of the match to play Surely this is too much to come back for this Even with some of the power that Manchester United have got out there because it's just not clicking for them and Of course yet again Liverpool have maintained their record of scoring at least three goals in every away match this season I mean to do it in the metropolitan and all-trafford in the same week Against the Spanish champions and Manchester United that's some going and they haven't they haven't just Just nick these goals in this first off. They haven't just not been ricochets or mistakes. They've been well-worked goals Real Madrid are two nil up on Barcelona In the in the big game in Spain today Barcelona nil Real Madrid to and Lucas Vasquez with the second goal For Carlo Ancelotti's side so Barcelona's walls continue little Manchester United plate forward But up Ronaldo was in an offside position that was So clear Even the assistant put the flag up I mean the organization of that back four at the moment for Liverpool is just it's outstanding the pace Wow Salah was pulled back there by sure he was away from him and that's going to be a yellow card for sure it is Salah was away just a blatant took back by the England left back shouldn't be that easy John It shouldn't be that easy the balls rolled into Salah is on the right wing ten yards inside Manchester United's half he lets the ball roll through his legs and sure is so upright He can't see where the ball is so he has to pull Salah back because he's done it with a bit of skill This was on the right wing about 15 yards inside the Manchester United half But Salah's caused real problems for Manchester United by coming centrally so much He's been involved in the build up to two of the goals in a central position And as Dion said when the ball was played by Salah it hit McGuire bounce to Keita right side of the area But Salah's reaction was so quick He just he just got there on the edge of the six yard box and in that position when it came across low from Keita flash And into the back of the net Yeah, that's all the players you want it to fault it to Salah. It was just Not so much to finish not so much the ball from Keita It was just the desire from Mo Salah to get past because sure try to pull his shirt To try and get him back But Salah just shook them both off got into a dangerous area and hope the ball will come just that desire to score goals It shows that's why he scored so many goals This is a story Dion is met this school in Manchester United nil Liverpool 3 Barcelona have got a very late goal back against Real Madrid Sergio Acuero has scored and the seventh minute of added time so Barcelona 1 Real Madrid 2 and I think they're still playing Manchester United coming vainly forward Greenwood was offside Van Dijk got to the ball first in any case and just planted into the crowd Great result for Liverpool great score line for Liverpool For Manchester United for Oligo Nassau-Shar. This is the stuff of nightmares. It is it isn't you know They'll go in half-time United, you know, we're looking at each other though. We think you won't What have you done and then the other play we think you want a what have you done? They've done nothing at the moment Manchester United every time a man United player gets the ball They're looking at positive to say No real they don't really know what to do or who to pass to It's all over in the new camp or the camp new whatever you prefer Barcelona 1 Real Madrid 2 So in Spain tomorrow in Catalonia tomorrow, they'll be talking about the manager's job at Barcelona And in England tomorrow in Manchester tonight, they'll be talking about the manager's job Here at Old Trafford unless we see something Transformational in the second half Paul Pogba on the substitutes bench. I guess he's got to make a change at half-time Yeah, listen, this is this is what it's all about Oli. How good are you? How good, you know, you know Your players who do you bring on who do you take off got Lingard on the bench as well who we know can make a huge difference When he comes on Cavani as well Manchester United coming forward but Liverpool leading by three goals to nil five line on the world service from the BBC Highlights tonight match of the day have passed ten five-life football daily podcast in the morning to hear all of the Reaction and fallout a six or six to talk about it tonight with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton We'll bring you the live interviews during the course of six or six as well We'll hear from Jurgen Klopp and Oli Gunnar Solskjaer. So do not miss that But we've still got over a half of football to play yet Canate at the back puts his foot on the ball and And really in some ways, I think he set the tone canate Coming into the team strong performance confident performance only his third appearance Playing at the back But really the issues at the back have been at the other end MacTomonet comes out with the ball from Firmino and then Firmino just nibbles back at him free kick Fred takes it quickly out to the left-hand side And just United need something quickly. We're in the 45th minute Halftime break coming most of all Trafford sits quietly Not that section to our right. You can hear them. Here's Rashford on the left-hand side Rashford back to Fred Fred now lays it forward to Shaw Shaw's past a stray into the penalty area Liverpool clear Linda Lough back to MacTomonet Thought that missing Firmino might be an issue for Liverpool, but not a bit of it And here's Rashford now forward into the penalty area finding way through all world played Rashford and then pulls it back Van Dyke was there instead of Ronaldo Liverpool clear. Yeah great bit of skill that From Rashford down the left-hand side goes past Trent Alexander. No problem at all great play from Rashford inspirational stuff that didn't have the final pass Van Dyke was there as I say instead of Ronaldo and now Liverpool come forward again Robertson angles it back This is going a long way, but Bruno Fernandez will get there first just pushes it away Takes Kater out of the game. He found Rashford three minutes of added time being played now Manchester United trying to find the goal that they really need before halftime green with through for Ronaldo Ronaldo blocked by Allison who came out well from the angle blocked the attempted little clip and then Ronaldo has a swing Oh Ronaldo has a swing at Jones. He kicked at the ball, but he caught the player who was on the ground Liverpool react Bruno Fernandez is in there trying to take Ronaldo away This could this could easily be a red card for Ronaldo depends what the officials have seen Anthony Taylor is there Fred is is having a little dust up with canate as well Ronaldo has been has been taken away. He's now left the scene of this kafufo down in one corner Anthony Taylor is pointing to Ronaldo He's walking away from it now. He says to Ronaldo. He's pointing a finger Oh, I think he might be going. No, it's a yellow card It's a yellow card Ronaldo does the motion of the ball and says that he's kicking at the ball and Anthony Taylor says only yellow card Wow, wow, wow, that is if I've ever seen frustration that is total frustration there Wow, it was Joe's that got to the ball first actually and then he started to shield it Yeah, it was it was aggressive from Ronaldo Well, I'm gonna get the ball Jones is shielding the ball does well and does well and Ronaldo swings a foot rounding John scores to ground falling on the ball and Ronaldo kicks twice at the ball Which is in Jones midriff as he lies on the ground and does make contact with the ball. He does kick the ball Yeah, he does but I think it was the aggressive nature that he kicked the ball as well. So I'm reflection may be seeing the replay Yellow card may be a lot of referees quite easily would have given a lead there could have been quite easily given red there could have been a reason There's a there's a talking point certainly You'll hear more about that. They might mention it Robbie and Chris and you know what? Might mention it a couple of times. Was it a red card? Yes or no There's on the fence Manchester United nil Liverpool throw a high foot from Fred and now he's caught Kate at No, listen, we've seen we've seen this cause problems this week Griezmann was sent off for the high foot that That caught for me know in the week and it's a yellow card for Fred He's I mean it was head height for Fred Kate are leaning into it yellow card And that's not a million miles away for From what Griezmann was sent off in Madrid in the week it doesn't make contact though No, he doesn't make contact at all seeing the replay kind of pulls his foot I he knows he's going high and then he decides to pull out Fred because he sees Kater's head there He's trying to stand over Kater and apologize to the physios as well looks concerned Fred Kater looks okay He looks okay. I didn't see any contact John Which I think maybe a saved Fred so 3-0 the Liverpool Kater Jota and Salah with his 13th goal of the season Kater still receiving treatment So most Salah extending his Liverpool record he scored in his now in 10 successive Liverpool matches that is 13 and 12 appearances this season and just the record stack up This means that he's the first to score in Liverpool's first five away league matches of a season since Sam Raybold in 1902 I think I played with him Sam bit of a clogger War long woolly socks and And also is the first Liverpool player to score in three successive matches at Manchester United So I mean Salah's correct collecting records like they're going out of fashion. I've got some vinyl That's about all the records I collected well, they're all the rage Here's Robertson Robertson playing it through Jota in the middle now to the right Salah left for Chinese in It's a ball in added time at the end of the first half Salah scored again as easy as you like 12 yards out No backlift bottom corner. This is embarrassing for Manchester United and Ali gonna Salchard But what a result for Jurgen Klopp and for Liverpool Halftime coming up Manchester United mill Liverpool for That is an incredible score line. I mean Liverpool Manchester, you know, I'm looking at the replay here I'm looking at Manchester United's defense and shores left What is it to on one is? It's trying to come across he's trying to help his center half out center halves have crossed over never crossed over Linda loves trying to get in sure has to leave south has to leave Salah on the far post Salah just puts it in the near post. He'd normally go across the keeper. Listen. It's so easy for Liverpool. This is they've worked so hard It's just Talk about a chorus of booze That was a cacophony of booze Inside all traffic. I don't think I've ever heard all traffic boo like that not 70,000 of them anyway. I mean it's just It's still going They must be so embarrassed the fans the players walking off the pitch have got to feel embarrassed as well Liverpool dominated in every Department you want to talk about Scoring goals that easy for them Well, you're gonna sell show walks away down the touch line He's chatting away to Mason Greenwood with his shot his arm around his shoulder as they disappear down the tunnel That for Manchester United and for soul shout was an absolute nightmare You name it it went wrong and Liverpool scored four goals Kater in the fifth minute Jotter in the 14th and Then Salah weighed in with two as we kind of felt that he would in the 38th minute and then right at the end in added time What a half for Liverpool They're looking so strong five-nil at Watford last weekend and winning in Madrid But this this tops the lot and we still got 45 minutes to go Manchester United nil Liverpool four we've got spider-man in the crowd Tom Holland is here They'll need all the superheroes to get out of this one Climbing the walls before long here inside old Trafford you would think because this is embarrassing For Manchester United. Oh my word John I want to take you back to to January last year and we were here to watch Manchester United play Manchester City in a League Cup semi-final first leg city with three nil up at halftime and we said We'll open the phone lines because this could be it for Oligo and Solciar. Well, this is for and it's Liverpool Yeah, and we've said many times actually over the course of the last couple of seasons that he has tended to get results when he's Really needed them and and he did you know they they staged a comeback of sorts in that match and And and got themselves up into second place in the Premier League last season But there is a lot of noise around him right now this season. We're only in the middle of October but As we sit here watching this empty red seats all around old Trafford not sure how many will be occupied at the start of the second half This is a really tough time. The the pressure is ratcheted right on him here And Dion as good as Liverpool have been and they have been very very good Manchester United have made themselves problems time and time again at the back And you know what John mentioned it before the game, you know this tag of Olly doesn't know they have no They have no structure. How do they play? You know, they do they play tippy-tappy football do they go long? What do they do do they play through the furs and you watch that and you think well? I'm not quite sure how Manchester United play because I can see one Berserker looking forward and There's nothing I can see Greenwood making a run and they the run hasn't been seen they are so disjointed And and the thing that really annoys me is when the ball goes dead That's when you need your leaders to say right This is what we're doing you stay here as a defender You stay here as a defender plug the holes for the next five ten minutes because Liverpool have been so dominant And they've been dictating to Manchester United players what they want you to do they're dragging them out They're playing now and they're getting in The Manchester United fans who are disappearing into the concourse beneath us will be getting their phones out will be venting their fury This is the kind of thing they're saying 8505 a at 5 live sport Ross only makes good signings He'd make a good sporting director. He is not a coach Neaton United are a team of individuals Some look awe-inspiring on paper but inspire frightened agony for fans when they play together there is no discipline map Absolute shambles same predictable formation no change in tactics lorry Oli It's simply time to go. Let's bring in Chris Sutton. It's going to be a quiet for an increase. Oh Blimey, I mean what a half that I mean that must rank as one of the most embarrassing halves of football in Manchester United's history. Yeah four nil I mean it is it is a total total mismatch I think Dion nailed it really, you know Liverpool have an identity, you know when they press the ball They press as a unit Manchester United don't what are they and the question is is where are they heading? Under Oli will Oli survive this? I mean four nil is bad enough, but this could be anything Couldn't it Chris? You know when you know when you've been in a situation I've been in a situation one down two down three down you get in a bit of a pasting You actually as players you can't forget the coaches Chris, don't you and you have to do something about it on the pitch or Stop the rock for a few minutes at least. Yeah, but it's not like that Oli hasn't been given all the weapons this season, you know Ronaldo signed verand signed sancho has signed that you know They've got everything together and they still cannot compete with Liverpool with Manchester City with Chelsea It had to be this season for Oli, but it's just not happening for him. Is it? Chris is the difference this season that you know, we said it before the game This isn't the first time that the vultures have circled over Oli gonna. So I is the difference now because of those players He's got no excuse absolutely No excuses nowhere to go now and you know when you're being I mean this is a this is a thrashing This is a mauling from You know arguably their their their biggest rivals Liverpool a Humiliating Manchester United on their own page from the Manchester for a Manchester United fan this can't get any worse Can it know and the question? I mean look you don't have to plug for callers tonight. Do you it's the six or six is going to be Absolutely, I hope it's what's the big question going to be well the the the question is Where does Oli go from here? I mean is this the end is this the end for Oli this evening Does it have to be the end for Oli this evening? Are there any Manchester United fans out there who think Oli is still the man to take the club forward? Chris, thank you very much Chris Sutton and Robbie Savage with you for six oh six after full-time here at Old Trafford They've lied the last time Liverpool beat Manchester United four nil 1990 a hat-trick from Peter Beardsley. This is big United nil Liverpool four second half commentary with Dion Dublin and John Murray So Four nil to Liverpool and the teams are out for the start of the second half and the answer to the question We asked at the end of the first period is there are lots and lots of empty red seats looking at the Stretford end Maybe people haven't come back to their seats yet, but Sir Alex Ferguson stand I mean second tier of the Alex Ferguson stand. It's almost half full Yeah, you can actually see the whole S of Manchester because you the whole S there in the lower tier Yeah, wow well he sent sent the players out early the classic Unhappy managers move and they stood almost like statues Waiting for Liverpool to come out to join them Pogba's come on. That's the change that Oli Gunnar Solcher has made He's brought him on for Greenwood Dion Yeah, and hopefully that hopefully he's gonna make a difference decision-making maybe picking a pass driving forward Fernandez putting the challenge in on Curtis Jones who came on as the first half substitute for the injured James Milner and Yellow card out for Bruno Fernandez per talking Telling the assistant what he what he thinks of him So yellow card for Bruno Fernandez right at the start of the second period. It's quite a bad tackle I should look at the replay there and he catches Jones down the down the left card didn't get much of the ball at all. So frustration still there at the moment Judging by that first challenge There's unhappiness there that that reaction from Bruno Fernandez how they looked when they were standing there 11 individuals waiting for the Liverpool players to come out That in itself spoke volumes even if they weren't speaking to anyone Free kick Alexander-Arnold then on the right hand side Liverpool looking for five in it goes for me No, got his head to it but glanced it right across the penalty area and behind for a goal kick So Pogba goes chasing after the ball To pick it up from in front of the hoardings down the little slope there and throws it back on That's better in terms of body language Manchester United now then with Dehaer, Wanderzakha, Lindelof, Maguire and Shaw Defence has been all over the place again for United midfield of MacTomon A Fred Pogba Bruno Fernandez Marcus Rashford and Cristiano Ronaldo and The Liverpool team Alisson Alexander-Arnold, Canate Van Dyke and Robertson Kater Henderson and substitute Jones Salah Firmino and Jota and if you weren't listening in the first half Liverpool's four their fab four were scored by Kater Jota and two for Salah Free kick Rather drop ball send a field Anthony Taylor and Liverpool knock it back into their own half Liverpool supporters that you can hear in great voice great cheer This is some result after the week that they've had this is the third of four consecutive away matches So Watford they won five-nil Madrid that match in Madrid that thrilling game came back to win three two Got a Preston next midweek That's one of our commentary matches on five live and sports extra in the caribou cup Now there's a mistake a rare mistake for uh for Liverpool on the left hand side Just um the poor church actually miscontrolled it Jones and it's out of play for a throw in to Manchester United I mean they've they've just carried on where they left off Liverpool ball at the feet just playing one twos The what Liverpool do really well as they pass the ball at pace when you pass the ball at pace You do something called passing the ball on passing the time on you give your teammate lots of time on the ball And they're doing it and then just start the second half Manchester United trying to build from the back playing towards the the now Nowhere near full straight for then lots of gaps looking now that the match is Into the fourth minute of the second half. Yes, there are still big gaps there Lots of empty red seats right in the middle of the lower tier of the straight for then one of the most popular areas Bruno Fernandez incidentally that that yellow card was for descent not for the tackle You could easily have got it for the tackle actually Bruno Fernandez himself is Fouls sent to field And Manchester United with Ronaldo and Shaw Going back halfway inside their own half under darkening skies here Cluglight's taking full effect And this as we said right at the start will be going all around the world this score line every corner of the world Where they're interested in football Have you heard Liverpool are winning four nil at all trafford Henderson now playing it forward. Oh lovely ball Salah's in for the hat trick he's overrun it. No, he hasn't He scored it Lovely touch just a final little talk Passed to here and into the back of the Manchester United net Salah scores a hat trick. It's Manchester United nil Liverpool five and for only the second time in history Liverpool score five goals against Manchester United here at old trafford What a day what a day to remember for those Liverpool fans who are cheering in the stands But a day to forget For united and only gonna soldier My word Jordan Henderson is in the middle of the park is in the centre of the d is one yard Inside Manchester United's half In place of all the outside of his boot which dissects the two centre halves of Manchester United Salah gets onto it the rest is history. What a finish A hat trick for Mo Salah Liverpool are making this look like a training game Hat trick Salah He just goes just gets better and better that's 15 goals now this season And his fourth hat trick for Liverpool Here is Rashford who is coming back from an offside position and it's a free kick to Liverpool halfway inside their own half So we might see something that we've never ever seen before today. Dion this score line Liverpool's record win Well, the only time that they scored five goals here at old trafford that was back in 1936 They won five two Both teams were struggling that season Manchester United ended up being relegated But today in 2021 We see Liverpool score five goals against Manchester United at old trafford for the first time since 1936 Five nil and the television cameras predictably have picked up Well, I can only describe your old manager Sir Alex Ferguson as scowling in the stands in the director's box to our left Here's Pogba playing it forward ball bounces back But Robertson is there and is able to put it out of play for a throw to Manchester United down the right Yeah, there doesn't seem to be any danger at this present time of Manchester United Causing Liverpool any problems No reaction as yet. No shouting. No screaming. No anger from the man United players United coming forward Here's the cross van Dijk gets up and challenge heads it away I'm not sure Liverpool's traveling support will ever have sung louder Maguire takes control plays a lovely ball to Ronaldo inside the box Ronaldo skipping from left to right shoots and scores very sick Well despite everything that's the same old Ronaldo Super pass from the choir great work from Ronaldo. He had a lot to do And he drove it right footed beyond the dive of allison and Manchester United at least are on the score sheet United won Liverpool five. Yeah, no celebration whatsoever to see in the replay He's just on side played on side by Robertson at left back He gets into that area just inside the left downside of the box on the corner Drops his left shoulder comes in on his right and curls into the far corner past allison a really really good finish That's Ronaldo. That's what he does The the match has not restarted yet. So VAR just just absolutely checking That he was on site the weight goes on And uh, it looks on site. No, no the goal is ruled out Liverpool fans cheer even more loudly. Well the lines we're seeing here That looked on site the the shot that we saw With those lines it looked like he was he was on side by a good half yard, but Maybe they're the wrongs. Maybe they're the wrong features. We're looking at it remains Manchester United nil Liverpool five And uh, Cristiano Ronaldo's very good goal does not stand. It's as you were Five nil This is incredible. It really is. I've not seen united players like this looking, you know for lawn Clueless at the moment as well. Not sure who to pass to where to pass how to pass They have got to find a way at the moment man united To do something positive give us something positive Liverpool defending at the moment and uh Ibrahim a Canate before the match it looked like Liverpool had problems with no Fabinho But no Fabinho no problem. He has Jones playing it through maguire Looks to have caught jotter on the edge of the box. The referee's having a look. He's given the free kick It was in the d I mean, it was so close to the penalty area Maguire lunged in just as jotter broke through He was sent spiraling into the box and referee taylor had a long think about that and has given us as a free kick Yeah, I think he's right as well. It was it was a yard or two outside The box right in the middle of the d as well not too far from the 18 yard line I think it's jones that has two or three options maguire's pointing Telling wambasaka to stay with famino And i'm just watching that. Yeah, he just catches jotter Before he catches the ball edge of the box. We've got that one spot on yeah, he uh He just caught the trailing leg of jotter who was sent uh Falling into the penalty area and then cleared the ball yellow card for maguire For that challenge, but it's right on the edge of the penalty area So free kick for liverpool. It's one of those where we say maybe it's a little bit too close But nothing is impossible for liverpool today. I've just looked at the center center half here van dyke. This is definitely van dyke territory Definitely van dyke territory the way he's striked the ball He's now striding forward That would put the seal on it wouldn't it if van dyke Flatters this into the back of the manchester united net Well, there are four of them talking about it. Salah's already scored a hat trick. Don't be greedy more Alexander randall likes the look of this as well Be greedy moe be greedy moe Van dyke's wonder away, it won't be him might be tapped short Henderson is is in a position where he's winding himself up four or five yards behind the ball So, uh, you think alexander randall into top corner free kick alexander randall little tap Salah hits it into the bottom of the wall bounces out for roberton roberton now to the left hand side that's played across by Jones and deflected wide of the near post from that side And it is a corner for liverpool So manchester united nil liverpool five rinaldo's goal was ruled out So i've had to get the uh find the tipx pen So, uh, rinaldo's name will be expunged corner vent for liverpool Into the near post united get ahead to it and uh fred is underneath it and then brunner fernandez Wax it away downfield allison's out of the penalty area. Oh, there's confidence for you. There's confidence in nonchalance uh, allison that 70-yard pass the goalkeeper took it down on the top of his thigh And then cleared it downfield and liverpool come again Manchester united stretched here femeno on the left hand side femeno up against wanbasaka Left footed cross to here as able to catch it So come in jonathan agnew with the latest on pakistan india Well, it's going pakistan's way very easily at the moment 71 for no wicked chasing 152 to win terrific batting It's from mohammed reiswan 35 that out from 30 balls in the captain barbara's arm 34 from 30 virac coley A face rather like uh, alex ferguson's possibly at the moment looks like he's chewing a wasp not happy at all 71 for no wickets are 81 needed from 61 Even nailed it jonathan as ever Even though you can't see him United are going to make a double change next ballo and cavani are going to come on i've managed to Make christiano ronaldo's name disappear from my list of scorers And we've got over half an hour to play Manchester united nil Liverpool five is the scoreline of the day the scoreline of the weekend The scoreline of the season It is as the americans say A score aligned for the ages Five nil for Liverpool at all trapper It would be their biggest win ever here bruner finandez crossing it's cleared away By canate on the edge of the six yard box cleared up into the air By robertson pogbaz underneath it and united red shirts with the white trim white shorts black socks being humbled here by their greatest rivals And uh, wan besata crossing from the right hand side hits a Liverpool defender of bounces behind and Manchester united Have a corner it's going to be Rashford and bruno finandez who are going to be substituted So corner is taken short and uh, and cater is caught in there As as the ball comes back just outside the box and pogbaz slid in got the ball But he caught cater as well and it's a free kick and it's a yellow card for pogbaz Yellow cards are mounted up now. They can man chest united. That's just pure Frustration as well. I mean they've got a corner man chest united put the ball in the box Don't try and complicate it. You're not having a good day lads put the ball in the box give yourself a chance Just watching that me play there. I think he did dive in. I think the referee look at his head stood showing Is there not there is some stood showing as well? He's very lucky. I've seen them given us red cards as well Again pogbaz lucky. That's a couple of players now that have been lucky. I think reynauldal in the first half Could have been a red card Bruno down the right hand side in front of us Oh and now hang on. I think antony taylor's shown us the rectangle there in the air And he's been called to come and have a look at this So this could be pogbaz in trouble The very fact that the bar stewart atwell has called antony taylor across he's sprinted across the field here It's just down On the side of the the ground where we are the the tv screen on its black stalk Anthony taylor's now in front of it. Look shores come across to the edge of the pitch the assistant Gary bezik is saying to the manchester united players maguire and fred and shore who are looking over the shoulder If this is a rectangle, this is bad news as antony taylor moves away. That means That the yellow card is ruled out and paul pogbarr is going to be sent off. There's the red card for pogbaz And now manchester united five male down deliver pool have paul podbarr half time substitute sent off Wow and I He left the floor is out of control His studs were showing And the way that paul pogb is gone off the pitch as well. He's kind of resigned to the fact that That wasn't his best challenge I'm not sure who he caught there. I'm not sure who the tackle was on was it on cater He's caught him cater still down actually getting treatment. So Paul pogbarr in the corner of the ground was walked straight off the field no messing And he passes the corner flag There are some supporters applauding him in the the bottom section of the strep for den but he disappears down the tunnel Which is now pulled back So manchester united down to ten men five nil down deliver pool Oli gunnar solshar is talking to kivani Who's about to be sent on What on earth can he be saying? I mean where where can they possibly go in this game from here? You know, I think the body language. Yes, you're five down against your biggest rivals You've got 29 minutes to go half an hour to go There's a lot of game to go There's a lot of work to be done if you want to get back in this game, of course there is But show us something. They're just all individuals at the moment now. They've been brought together now the game is talking to the players It's far too late, but show me some positive body language manchester united players Well, it's bruno finandez who is the first player to be withdrawn So it's going to be finandez and rashford and remember there were there were doubts There were fitness doubts over both of these players So that is maybe partly the reason that they are coming off the field But they're both walking off with heads bowed rashford Only just back from injury himself And bruno finandez who had the early chance if you remember deon when it was nil nil in the brief period of this match when it was nil nil Bruno finandez did have the chance that wasn't taken And the rest is now modern history So kivani is on and that's it. Those are the three substitutes So kivani number 21 takes his place up front and uh The libra pool supporters inside are all trapped under having an absolute ball Little worrying for navi kata who's still receiving treatment And actually they've got the stretcher out and he's being lifted onto the stretcher and carried away And that's going to be the end of his afternoon. So alex oxley chamberland coming on for him I mean it was a poor challenge by Because of his force. Yeah, it was as well and he leaves the floor and he's you know when you see the replay You can see he's got his stud showing as well catches kata on the calf as well and the shin And the referee has no real what does he do? You know, he's trying to give me yellow card. He tries to see with his own eyes He looks at it again and I think he's Unfortunately right to give a red card to pocba. Can't challenge like that. Look where you're stud showing This is really tough for kata who as you'll be aware has struggled really to To get himself into the first team and make himself a regular Liverpool and they've been really promising signs again lately scoring Here in the first half as he did in Madrid in the week and now he's been strapped to a stretcher and has been carried away And alex oxley chamberland is onto the field So manchester united nil Liverpool five BBC radio five live and the world service live from A raucous old trafford, but only one section of old trafford is raucous and that is where those those Liverpool supporters are who will have A great night this evening in fact You know, they will quite possibly Never have known a night like this To celebrate what is currently a five nil win a record win for Liverpool at old trafford Here's salah already three goals for him now for mino on the right hand side for mino the cream shirts of Liverpool running rings around manchester united's red Van Dyke Strokes it forward towards jones robertson now on the left hand side robertson going back to To jones so the lines are open for five live listeners to call six or six and talk to robbie savage and chris sutton about these events at old trafford As it's played forward by oxley chamberland Salah down the right hand side clips it across but it will land on the roof of the net to here just Jumping hopping up and touching the crossbar.

He didn't even look at him Took it forward. He struck it from about 25 yards on the angle and that was nested in in the top corner. What a save Corner is taken short by liverpool The trouble remains henderson clips it in maguire is up there headed away headed further away on the edge of the box by gallo and then reynolds charges down an attempted forward pass by oxley chimbaland And it bounces all the way back to alexander So liverpool start again.

They must have had They must have had a hundred passes here between them. Yeah, and they're in no rush at all to get into that final third Because the man united players man united at the moment are playing the five at the back Dallow's gone in there made a five And they've only got two forwards If I was a captain here, I'm saying get out of my way get into midfield and let's get that ball back Let's show a little bit of pride So alex Ferguson this will be tough watching from him your old manager in the stands I mean, can you imagine what he would have said if If his team had been on the on the wrong end of this?

He would have been gutted to be out the side He's on now and he's got plenty of time So Sadio mani Takes his place through the middle Sadio mani And uh, a throw into Liverpool on the right hand side Which is the mani will be in the middle jotter on the left hand side for the time being at least End of the last 15 minutes we go Manchester united nil Liverpool five was four nil at halftime Mo Salah got his hat trick early in the second half Paul Togba was then sent off Cristiano Ronaldo so he'd scored but the goal was ruled out for a very tight offside decision What about that finish as well by the way Dion for the hat trick goal for Salah? Yeah, he's never never under pressure. He always makes sure that his preparation When he's about to strike a ball is very very good.

So that is your your evenings Listening guaranteed if you're on a long car drive tonight Enjoy that with Jenny garen jack nipples and jolly and Palmer who are always an excellent team Here's uh Liverpool with Henderson in the center circle four towards alexander arnold alexander arnold now at the salah I mean Liverpool over the course of well, I think since podberg got sent off They the the possession over that period of the match has got to be 80 percent probably more than that And kind of embarrassing at the moment really has Henderson in the center circle to the right hand side Jordan Henderson gets it back And then alexander arnold And really they're just knocking the ball around between the manchester united players. This is This is a a gross embarrassment for manchester united And and all of the time More and more of the manchester united fans are just quietly heading away to the exit. Yeah, but you I'm looking at manchester united now And I know you five down the embarrassments there already the embarrassments gone You've got to do something about this There's five at the back and the only player that's occupying those five defenders is sadio mani I don't understand why you just don't just go for it. You've got nothing to lose you embarrassed already Try and get a ball back make a tackle positive something something Liverpool In possession again They'll extend this unbeaten run of theirs their longest unbeaten run under clock in all competitions ballplay for the jotter Who very nearly wriggles away from lindelhoff, but it runs through lindelhoff did enough And manchester united finally have got the ball back and it's in the gloves of david de here So eight eight five nine oh nine six nine three to call robbie savage And chris sutton to talk about this or indeed lester's very good win At brentford edinson kevani conceded a free kick for a foul on canate Lester winning two one at brentford west ham winning one nil against top them Ikela Antonio scoring the only goal there so west ham in fourth place in the table again Rangers top of the table by three points after their win at st Mirren and sheffield united and full of the winners in the championship Jordan Henderson gives the ball to alexander on i mean henderson's under no pressure at all Every time he gets the ball in the center circle. There's not a liveable player not a manchester united player within 10 yards of him So so comfortable it could not be more comfortable You know they're halfway inside manchester night off and listen i know the game's done I know many night aren't going to get back into this but You know the frustration i'm not going i'm not saying go and kick somebody don't hurt anybody but just run around work hard and They don't seem to be doing it. They've resigned themselves Salah Salah is absolutely atre to To get on the ball and get into the game He wants it in the danger area and he's got this his record as we heard from him earlier in the afternoon You know despite the goals that he scored last season 31 in all competitions last season Wasn't the leading scorer in the premier league harry kane got that ball played for it He has that man inside the box chest it down nicely left foot shot hits maguire Who's right in front of him and then fred gives it back to maguire who passes it away and then ronaldo has headed it Straight back for for libra pool ronaldo heading it straight to kurtis jones and now robertson on the left his cross Hicks one for sack out bounces across the area. It's hooked up in the air to here should catch this he does he's underneath it Yes, it's terrible at the moment isn't it? It's really hard to watch a man united side like this completely Inept of any idea whatsoever. They're not sure what to do the balls in David the guy has hands and he's waving his players as if say get into a position Well, I can roll the ball to you And the ball's given back to never fall again. Yep, they've lost it again inside their own heart jones Now to jota jota left foot shot that hits the the back of wanda sackers carbs and rebounds to kivani and then Fred is rather bundled over center field So it's a pretty kick to manchester united and they're just going to take a breather here united after after all of that chasing of the ball who can blame them I mean the the two seven halves and libra pool canate and verge of undyke. I don't think they've been anywhere near their own 18 yard box for the last 20 minutes 25 minutes have been on the half wayline Manchester united finally freds on his feet and united take the three kick And one bersak is going to have a little run down the right hand side The ball ran out of play it was touched out of play. There were two libra pool players on him challenge came in and deflected out of play And uh, and it's manchester united's ball. So for once for once over the course of these last 20 minutes Manchester united have got possession Inside the libra pool half. It was a foul on wanda sackers. So it's a free kick and a chance for the set piece And a chance for manchester united to perhaps get on the score sheet that really that's going to mean Diddly squat in the grand scheme of things Free kick out on the right manchester united have sent everyone up libra pool have actually got everyone back defender so this Free kick from manchester united high in towards the back post matamane with a free header It's deflected against the crossbar. Cavani was there just a couple of yards out coming in at pace It it hit him hit the crossbar bounced out and van dyke cleared. Yeah, I mean It just shows limp all back making sure that the man united don't score I just think they just the pride in not consuming the goal is there to see So the corner into the near post and that is up and headed away for liverpool And uh, and manchester united come back again, but at least two players were in offside position So liverpool have it once again manchester united nil liverpool five is the score here at old trafford and Pakistan on the way to victory with you jonathan agnew they certainly are 27 They want from 28 balls and they haven't lost a wicket. I guess it's much much of a power in what you're seeing now 125 for no wicket some terrific batting uh from rizwan and also babaras um And india have been off it today the boleans being poor whereas, uh, parkistan traditionally Blew rather hot and cold they've been absolutely far up from the various dot. They deserve this win 126 for no wicket They need 26 more. Yeah, just in the way that liverpool deserve this win Oleg an assault shot before the match said that manchester united were we're going to come out Right from the start here. They had an early chance that bruno finandez Wasn't able to to get on target with the shot and then the scoring started for liverpool kater Jota and a hat trick for salah. It was four nil at halftime very soon in the second half it was five nil and And manchester united just haven't laid a glove on them deal No, they haven't they've not had the ball for a long time either I mean there was a moment there when liverpool could have broke quickly and trend ali zander tried to break quickly and he didn't And van dyke saying calm down keep the ball Manchester united defending again Salah on the right Back towards alexander on now robertson And then uh kurdice jones jones full 360 degrees and now hinderson Mania is there in a more deep lying position hinderson a little further forward oxley chamberlain on his left foot. He can't hit them, but that one flies away Wide and a little high of the angle of postman barring behind and into the lower tier of the east stand We have a lot of care liverpool being incredibly professional I mean the job's been done, of course it has in regards goals, but The way that they're managing it the players that I can see Managing their own teammates on the pitch as well trend alexander trying from 30 yards, but Just the organization and the work rates and everything's just spot on from liverpool I've seen nothing from united all day United supporters are trying to make a bit of noise inside the stadium those supporters who are still here What do you reckon the uh, how many united fans do you think are still in the ground? Well, there's got to be at least 15 000 20 000 have gone There's just so many red seats that we can see now. Oh a challenge on on jota who is sent spinning Center field was one basaka who came in that was a little late. That's a bit clumsy. That's another yellow card. How many is that now? one two three four five one two three four five six and pogba's red card Six yellows in the red And jota was stayed down. There's a little bit of concern here. They haven't called for the medical people yet So I think he's going to be okay. Yeah, he's just being helped to his feet He scored the the second goal slid into convert at one And the goals have have all been I mean they've played through manchester united. I think almost all five goals Absolutely. There's been nothing lucky about this before nothing lucky about the goals They've been there for a long time Great day for Liverpool this one of the great days for them And that's why they're singing that song whistles from the home supporters it's all they can do Liverpool playing it forward to alexander arnold With three minutes to play The only thing you can say for manchester united is It hasn't got any worse since salla scored the fifth goal for Liverpool in the 50th minute salla Backs away on the right hand side gets the ball down works it to alexander arnold alexander arnold And then with the outside of his boot Finds henderson centrally henderson scoops one forward kivani slips over on the edge of the box as he chests it down But he found a teammate in red and sure will play it away. They just got that one away to fred Dallow Chips it across for an aldo in the center circle Ronaldo turns lifts it out towards the right hand side, but i'm not sure when bersaq has going to get there is not it's actually caught off the field by by roberton So back it comes again I think the question's got to be asked as well deon whether whether the arrival of the great christiano rinaldo has actually set things off kilter here And listen he scored six goals in eight appearances before today. Absolutely. Is that? As you know, they're doing it back on the halfway line. It is rinaldo square to kivani kivani Then back centrally to mcdomine mcdomine to fred fred outside the box left for the ball across It's behind kivani and they have to trot out towards the far side and in any case he was in an offside position Freak it to love the pool so back to the rinaldo point. Yeah, it's it's you know, it can't be a negative Surely having rinaldo in your ranks, but it his goals have been brilliant his performances When he scored his goals have been brilliant But at the moment united don't look like They don't look like that they're in the same league as they look like they could be in a completely different league with limapool and Chelsea and sitting They look miles ahead of man united on this performance here at old trafford Manchester united Just a couple of minutes away from what will be their fifth defeat of the season in all competitions Their third premier league defeat of the season so they have lost three of their first nine And the debate is going to absolutely rage over oligone solshah's position unless and the club have been adamant about this For a lengthy period of time now That their support for oligone solshah is as they've said many times rock solid But this clearly will test that support and the question will be asked Jurgen Klopp No doubt about his position his roaring start to the season that liable have made Well, they've turned up the volume here with yet another superb away day Things with as well for manchester united. They're already out of the carabao cup So there is a spare week now for manchester united without a game coming up before They go to top them next saturday Nothing looks easy for them at the moment as kivani united concede another three kick Three kick just forward and left to the center circle Sorry, sorry, john. I've just seen mo salami come from the right wing He's gone into the center of the of the pitch into the center circle He's played four or five passes into jordan henerson and jordan henerson has passed them back to him Between them they've had about seven passes and nothing nothing at all from man united player Salah going back to alexander arnold three minutes of added time Get through that quickly enough manchester united And those who are left here and and and many more now they're disappearing in there in their hundreds and thousands One of one of the the worst defeats that manchester united have ever suffered here at old trafford Here's jotter on the left hand side jotter stabs it back to Cristiano Ronaldo a little bit of fancy footwork from him We've seen little and nothing of that today kivani now out to the right hand side van besaker is there This is a rare united attack van besaker crossing takes a deflection man that loops behind for a united corner It was actually our old friend angus lochron has been in touch to tell us it was 10 years yesterday Since the famous six one against manchester city here It's right up there with that or right down there. Yeah from a manchester united point of view. Yeah, it is It really is a really bad day for the fans of manchester united and the players How is he there corner then For united mac Thomony got his head to it headed across the box But Liverpool can clear and salla turns away He's off and running salla still hungry for more in this game the hat trick man plays it through And jones runs on to it and cuts back onto his left foot John shot his block though by the recovering defender van besaker It was it very nearly opened up there again for Liverpool with salas the creator this time. Yeah, he did and Jones is going through the middles. Sadio man is going through the middle Jota's going through the they had three players wanting to score the sixth goal. That's the hunger. That's the hunger that they're showing today We're into the second minute of added time All around old trafford manchester united supporters on their feet those who are still here and credit to them They they're singing their songs many of them wearing their scarves and clapping their hands And I suppose that that will be seen as a modicum of support For for those supporters farley gonna salshar and the team But the Liverpool supporters. I mean they have had what a day out this is for them This is one that they will tell their children and their grandchildren about that they were there to see this This record win for Liverpool Manchester united coming forward jota with a cross to the back post rinaldo is able to take it down And onto his left foot shoots it hits van dyke Ball cleared up in the air Haven't cleared the penalty area mcthomman a back then a shot from rinaldo who just pulls it wide from the angle and it's Low fives Between roberton and van dyke. They want that clean sheet the boys at the back. Yeah, I think they're going to get it Yeah, I agree. I really do it's this and it's great to watch them go forward but the concentration at the back A minute ago that robson stopping the ball coming into his box turn alexander stopping crosses They're five nil up and they're still working hard to keep that clean sheet started so well this season from anchester united with the the hamson win Against leeds united here five one beat newcastle four one But this will be four premier league games without the win And after this, I mean they can't win the title this season. You would have to say it And there it is the final whistle at old trafford One of the worst days for manchester united here at old trafford Olly gunner solshar looks towards urgen clop What an awful day for him in his team Who knows what the future will hold for him as he walks across now and he clasps hands with urgen clop But what a brilliant day for liverpool. They've never seen a day like this at old trafford It's a record win for them Five nil only the second time they've ever scored five goals at old trafford against manchester united The last was back in 1936 They have had the proverbial field day and they continue unbeaten this season liverpool they're back up to second They're in there right in the thick of this title race liverpool and urgen clop's team As he goes around all of his players and he says well done to canate who came into the team But manchester united off their goal heads down bidraggled battered beaten Deion Dublin I just thought liverpool were Explosive everything they did was was spot on It was very professional. It was very precise Looking at the screen most salos got another match ball underneath his left arm is getting congratulated by every teammate Players in bibs of the subs five five in him They love it when he scores. They love it when they win and when they play well like today There's very few teams that can live with them. Liverpool you deserve it today. You've been brilliant Yeah, liverpool come across urgen clop leads the way a big smile on his bearded face Jordan Henderson Fist clenched punches the air. There's a huge cheer He's the man who's leading the way the liverpool captain here Urgen clop as well stands with palms apart and now pats his chest as if to say How about that?

It's that sort of day Manchester United nil liverpool five Liverpool have not had it this good against united since 1990 When in the team was one of the men sitting about 10 yards to our left hand side Celebrating every goal when it went in he turned 60 this week Ian rush at the game today dion with kenny dal gleeche Even in their era this didn't happen You know what steve? They're legends. They're proper. They are proper not just liverpool legends. They're footballing legends But to do what this current liverpool side has done today here at old trafford in front of 76,000 fans I mean to embarrass Manchester United in this stadium in the way they did That's it's got to be down to the managers influence on those players How he sets them up the belief that he gives them the professionalism the hard work I can't think hard. I can't speak high enough of liverpool today. They were absolutely brilliant 1990 by the way when that four nil victory for liverpool over manchester united happened That was the same year when that famous mart robbins goal saved sir alex bergasson Can anyone save oligunus olsiadeon? I don't know. It's got to be difficult for him after a performance like today Or should I say more so the result? Five five goals at home against your biggest rival in football It's totally embarrassing. I don't know what he's going to say. I don't know what the higher. You're going to say I know what the fans will say though I'm just looking john at the messages. We've been getting on social media from manchester united fans This one time for og has to go not up to the job jack if ollie doesn't get sat tomorrow i'll be surprised barry If I was the glazers i'd walk onto the pitch and hand him his p45 total incompetence. This is disgusting steven as a liverpool fan It's so sad to hear united fans booing a playing legend united have lost something as a liverpool fan It's great, but I know things can change so fast. Well, we've been reading and hearing That the the authorities here are behind solcii, but that can change and fast That's been a consistent line from the manchester united hierarchy that they are rock solid behind ollie gonna solcii and what what he's trying to do and Listen, they've made those those big signings. They backed him massively with the arrival of sancho We didn't come off the bench today and admittedly, you know pogba was sent off so that that Changed things in terms of the the changes that he could make So sancho reynolds and verand who's obviously out injured at the moment we are still In the first couple of months of him having those players available to him But but this this result simply will have to provoke a discussion at the top of this club About whether they still feel that he's the right man for what they're trying to do You know one of the and I hate listen. I hate talking about my earlo and I was here. I was only here for a short while But I seen I seen players when things weren't going right putting it right on the pitch Body language saying something Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Paul, it's players that will take responsibility At 2-0 at 3-0. Yes, you're getting a doing You're getting taken to the cleaners. You're playing against a better team Don't let it continue to the fours and the fives Do something about it on the pitch. I didn't see anything like that today from any players in a red shirt taking responsibility Then basically the they had the trousers pulled down by Liverpool in the first half And in the second half Liverpool just toyed with them It was it was so simple for Liverpool. Listen. I seen Jordan Henderson He must have ran across the the centre the centre circle about 20 times getting it from van Dijk giving it to To whoever he wanted to he had so much time on the ball It was looking up. He had six or seven options. He'd play it. He'd get it back He was dictating the play he was shouting at his teammate Steve With a minute to go get back get back work hard. I can see him from here. I'm thinking That that is the sign of winners And there's also d on the spectre of Antonio Conte being out of work Peter Schmeichel I was reading in the times the other day talking about him saying I'm not sure about Conte He never stays longer than two years. Can you knighted thinking in those kind of timelines? They're going to think months weeks days, haven't they? I mean Steve you got off the we're talking about today's performance, right? And and and and the way it's gone today I don't know where Oli can go. You know as a bloke I like Oli a lot of people like Oli as a bloke But the man United fans don't see Oli the bloke They see the 11 players that go on the pitch and they're seeing performances. They're not happy with What you'll get from Antonio Conte we know this because we know him from Chelsea is that There's every chance he'll bring success And there's every chance that he will get more out of this this very very talented Manchester United squad but what you might get as well is aggravation and and Confrontation confrontation aggravation fallouts and also this would alter that the what Manchester United are trying to do because his history tells us that there's every chance that will be relatively short term So effectively with a manager like that you'd be going back to what they attempted to do With when Jose Mourinho was brought here and we know how what happened there There's a lot of aggravation and confrontation inside old trapper and celebration from the Liverpool fans to our right hand side
