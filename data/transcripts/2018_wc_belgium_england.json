  "transcript": " Yes, thanks Mark. Welcome to Kaliningrad. We're up here on the Baltic Sea coast. It's a beautiful evening. There's hardly a cloud in the sky and the sun is shining down on this. Actually quite compact rectangular stadium on the edge of the city of Kaliningrad. And we have had a huge cheer inside the stadium because there's now familiar ceremony before the match. All of the children are unfurling the flags of the two countries. England, the red and white crosses to the left of where we sit. And the Belgian flag of black, yellow and red is to the right with the image of the Russian World Cup in the centre circle. And the teams are now just coming into our sight down in front of the commentary gantry here. We're up on the second tier. We begin to see the children carrying out the flags ahead of the anthems. And now the teams as well with Eric Dyer leading out England at the World Cup with Harry Kane rested for this match. If you've just switched on to us on Five Live, no Harry Kane in the team. It's going to be Vardy and Rashford up front. I'll run you through the teams in full before we get underway. But they're just lining up for the anthems. The stadium here, I must say, I get the impression that there is a little bit of momentum growing behind England. For each group match we have seen more and more England supporters inside the ground. And as we heard from Rachel Burden who's down behind the hoardings to our left, Rachel says there are officially three and a half thousand England fans. I just have a feeling with all of the flags and all of the white shirts that there are many more than that. But we are ready. England and Belgium already qualified for the last 16 of this World Cup. So this match tonight all about deciding the positions at the top of the table and we're ready for the anthems. And the bright red and yellow of Le Diable Rouge are unmissable around the stadium. Huge pockets of them in various points splattered around the stands. T-Ball Courtois is the captain of the Belgian side today with Eden Azard not in the starting lineup. Vincent Coopney, Roberto Martinez said just they didn't want to risk his fitness in this match. So as the players complete the handshakes along the line and the Belgian players line up for their team photograph and the England men start to peel off their bright white tracksuits. This is the team that Gareth Southgate has picked tonight. Eight changes to no Harry Kane in it, no Lingard, no Henderson, no Walker, no Sterling. The team is Pickfitting goal again, Jones-Stones and Cahill in central defence. Alexander-Arnold and Rose are the wing-backs. So it's a competitive debut for Trent Alexander-Arnold, the 19-year-old, the youngest man in the squad. Eric Dyer with Ruben Loftus-Chick and Fabian Delph, either side of him and Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy up front. So for England that represents first starts at this World Cup, first starts at any World Cup for Rashford, Vardy, Dyer, Rose and Delph and first appearances here in Russia at this World Cup for Cahill, Jones and Alexander-Arnold. In fact, the outfield players, Danny Welbeck is the only man once kickoff here who won't have got onto the field. And the Belgian side, nine changes for them, Courtois and Boyatta, the only players to keep their places. So Courtois in goal, Dendonka Boyatta and Vermalen in central defence, Chadli Dembele Filene and Azad, that's Torgan Azad, Eden's younger brother with Yuri Telemann's Adnan Yannisai and then Nitchi Batjawe. So we'll only know Chris Waddle how this is going to shape up once we see kickoff and we see exactly what sort of rhythm and style we're going to be able to describe this evening. England drop off to the at-in yard lane and Belgium drop off to the at-in yard lane and we'll just pass the ball 50 yards each other. We just hope it's a good game and we hope they go for it. No matter where wins a group, wherever they go, they move on. This is England's real first test, even though they've made a lot of changes. Belgium tonight still got a lot of quality out there, some really talented players. But England's made a lot of changes so we still haven't really saw England's first team play a real strong side yet. Chris Waddle, 62 caps for England, played at the World Cup in Mexico and Italy and we're watching England against Belgium. Not what we anticipated it would be, but really for them both it's for all the right reasons because they are the two Group G teams who've won two out of two so far at this World Cup. They're lined up ready for kickoff here in Kaliningrad. So we're ready for the last 90 minutes of group action at this 2018 World Cup in Russia. England will kick off, Rashford will kick off for England and he plays the ball back to John Stones. Who immediately gives Phil Jones a first touch of the ball at this World Cup. Remember he played against Costa Rica in the final group match four years ago. Phil Jones. Now Gary Cahill with all of his experience, the most experienced man in terms of caps in this England squad. And England go all the way back to Jordan Pickford to our left. So the formula this evening, whoever does end up winning the group will be playing Japan in the last 16. As England looked to set away Vardy but the pass was a little heavy from centrefield and is straight through for a goal kick. And the runners-up in this section will play Columbia. All of the various reasons why England in inverted commas don't want to win the group because it'll be the easier side of the draw. Because it will involve less travel, because there'll be an extra day if you come through in the second position in the group before you play a match in the last 16. And also what the weather might be like, how hot it might be in Rostov. But as far as I'm concerned, and England have conceded a throw-in down in front of us, there are many players out there. There are players all over the pitch here who tonight are playing for places in the knockout stages of the World Cup. England, White shirts, blue shorts, white socks and Belgium playing the ball back. Vardy's onto this, Vardy on the right-hand side, Rashford's in the middle and Quadswell kicks it away. Comes out to Delph in the D and as he's challenged the ball runs away from him and then Fellaini gets a shove in the back from Fabian Delph. And Belgium take a quick free kick actually. So England have got to be smart here and Trent Alexander-Arnold deflects the ball out of play. And they think England started the break-off and they've chased things down, they've got a good tempo about them, Vardy there. Sloppy pass by Azad, who's playing left wing back tonight. Sloppy pass Vardy gets onto it and I don't know what Quadswell was thinking, they're kicking it away. But at the minute England have started break and Belgium, Matillam is actually sitting with them, Bellion. Fellaini's actually playing as the second sort of third striker. Yeah, he is. Almost right up alongside Michibachiouai with, out on the right-hand side for Belgium at Manjana's eye. It's the same for Belgium this evening. This team tonight as it's headed away by Dan Donkat on the right-hand side of the Belgian backline. And now Moussa Dembele is very nearly shrugged off the ball by Jamie Vardy who's nipping away at him. He got a touch on the ball but Dembele recovered very well. We know so well his strength and Belgium are able to play it up the right-hand side towards Yanisai. But K-Hill got there first and K-Hill turns and finds the pass back to Pickford who with his left foot pulls it across to Jones. And England building from the back with Trent Alexander-Arnold. As I say his first competitive appearance for England made his debut just before the World Cup at Elend Road against Costa Rica so this is a second cap. Here's Danny Rose on the left-hand side playing instead of Jung tonight. Rose's ball. This is a nice one for Rashford to chase which he does into a full-back position. But Boyatta comes across and just passes that out of play for an England throw down the left. Neil Nill. Well, I just probably think at the minute it's a canceling each other out. It's a quite high tempo game and whoever gets the ball there's a lot of pressure on it. Not many people are dealing with it very well at the minute. They're giving the ball away. Cheaply ball teams. BBC Radio 5 Live with England at the World Cup live from Kaliningrad which is the most westerly of the venues in this exclave, this Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania on the Russian coast of the Baltic coast. It's actually the home of the Baltic fleet here, the Russian Baltic fleet, the great might of the Russian Navy. Here's Delph on the left-hand side for England. Delph looks to lay it back into the penalty area for Rashford but the covering challenge comes in from Dendonka who just chips it out but the offside flag is up and it's a free kick to Belgium. England start a break again. They're moving the ball quick. Waiting for Belgium to settle a later, keep a possession game. Look after the football at the minute to find it difficult because England's in the faces. And again just to explain it for you, at the top of this group England are level on points with Belgium. They're level on goal difference with Belgium. They've both scored eight goals so at the moment as it stands they would be separated. Oh, there's a back pass from Van Marlen that was behind Boyetta and I think Kortua must have been looking the other way and actually Vardy was looking the other way as well otherwise he could have been in there. So at the moment they would be separated by their disciplinary record and Belgium have had one more yellow card than England. They will have to see what happens on that front this evening as well. Goal of Southgate was joking last night that if towards the end of the game he went across and headbutted Roberto Martinez then you'd know exactly what he wanted. It was a joke. Here's Van Marlen to the left hand side to Torgan Hazard and Hazard rolls it back into the Belgian half where Van Marlen chips it forward and Jones is just collided with the back of his Manchester United team-mates head, caught the side of his jaw. Fellainy of course is out of contract at Manchester United. Fellainy on the stretch, Delph comes across and England are back in possession with Loftus-Chic and Trent Alexander Arnold. Now Eric Dyer is beaten to the ball by Fellainy. Dembale plays it across, took it a flexion into the path of Yannisai and Yannisai now weaves out towards the right hand side. The support out there from Nasser Chadli just relegated with West Brom. Chadli then into a central position where the shot is saved by Pickford. A sort of stunning dipping effort that was from the central area and a very good reaction saved. A great effort, good build up by Belgium and moved the place from the left to the middle. He's got too much time on the ball. He gets one touch out of his feet, bends it within saves. It's a good save for Pickford but you would expect him to save. It was middle of the goal. Now it's time for the final game of the season. The number 17, the Monaco Youngster, 21 years old. Jordan Pickford was able to react well and eat it away. It's still England-nil, Belgium-nil. Obviously the Panama-Chinesia match is underway. The dead robot, the other final game in the group section in Saransk for the record. We'll let you know if there are any goals in that one. England with a ball on the left hand side. Both of these teams coming into this match now having won their opening group games with long unbeaten runs behind them. It's 12 matches now since England last lost a match over a year ago. Here is Rashford who tries to play it in field but it's blocked out of play by Dembele for a throw to England on the far side. Belgium for their part are on a 20-match unbeaten run and that is a Belgian national record. Each of them have won their last four matches, so both in confidence and form. England flag is waved in the stand behind where Rose takes this throw in. Back it goes to Delft. Then the cross from Rose is cleared away on the half volley and it comes out for Yannis I and Eric Dyer is a judge to have fouled him and it's a free kick to the Belgians. With a little bit of pressure there getting the ball in from the left, Belgian clear on it and Dyer giving a silly free kick away. It's been quite a lively start. I was expected to be a lot more slower. I thought the booties would drop off and let them have the ball at the back but it's quite a bit of pressure. Belgium bringing the ball away and it's Thomas Vermaulen who has had such serious injury problems over the course of years and years now. Coming into the side but not with Vincent Co. I saw them both train here last night but Roberto Martinez obviously just erring on the side of Co. He did not want to take any chances with a player of Co.'s importance in terms of what he means to this Belgian squad. He has Pickford with the ball at his feet. A little pass out of the penalty area to Jones. Alexander-Arnold infield to Dyer. Dyer turns and rolls it across towards the left-hand side to Gary Cahill and then a forward pass towards Delft. Delft who we hear will be returning home after this match. It's a long pass Delft but that's beyond the run of Vardy and Rashford and Courtois is able to come out and pick it up. His third child is about to be born and the word is that he will be going home for that Fabian Delft. He has Telemans bringing it forward. The ball out towards the right-hand side. Chaddly it is who gives it to Yannis-Eye. Yannis-Eye, couple of stepovers, couple more stepovers against Danny Rose into the penalty area. Left foot across to the back post. Fellainy heads it down. It's not cleared but Pickford... It wriggled out of Pickford's grasp but it was cleared off the line by Stones. The Belgians were appealing for it but it was over the line. Batuayu obviously got a touch in there because Pickford didn't have it under control as it came across. It was rather messy the whole thing. Fellainy headed it across. It was missed by an aerial kick. Batuayu was in there and it was scooped away off the line and it did not cross the line. Gary Cahill gets it away off the line and yeah it didn't go all the way. The other appealing for it but it did not cross the line. But if it makes up there, Yannis-Eye getting Rose on the back foot. Lovely cross to the far post. Fellainy with nose very strong and he heads it back down. Bit of a scramble. Cahill kicks it off the line. Yeah, Stones who missed his clearance. Sort of fly kick at the ball. Batuayu was in there. It was all at close quarters. Cahill was there too. I thought that Pickford had it under control but clearly not. So an important clearance off the line and it remains England nil. Belgium nil here on BBC Radio 5 Live. You can get in touch at 5 Live Sport on social media. You can listen as well via the BBC Sport website and the app. And if you do you'll be able to hear England with Trent Alexander-Arnold in possession. Now Marcus Rashford, his first start at a World Cup. Now back in towards Stones and Stones. Just caught there by Batuayu who missed the end of the season. Batuayu with Bruceya Dortmund but has recovered just in time for the World Cup. Now Alexander-Arnold receives it from Stones on the right hand side. A good forward run from him. Brought it down and he wins the corner off Torgan Azar. Second corner isn't it today for England? It was a good ball by Stones. He did well to get rid of Batuayu on the halfway lane. The centre circle and diagonal ball out to Alexander-Arnold. And ends up with a corner. Here it is. Alexander-Arnold's going to take this. Most of the Belgian support is at that end. The right side from us. Alexander-Arnold with the out-swinger at the back post and it's headed away. It will bounce to Delth and Rashford points to Delth. And then Delth gives it to Rashford who's cutting in field now on his right foot. He's going to try a shot which hits a defender Filene on the edge of the penalty area. He took a wide of goal and it bounced behind over the Hordings for another corner. This time from the left hand side. Alexander-Arnold took them from the right and he's going to take them from the left as well. It's going to full-back take them in the corners. Well it's usually. Tripierre are young isn't it? So here's Alexander-Arnold. Tripierre not risked tonight. He had his thigh strapped the other evening. So Alexander-Arnold wipes his face with his left arm. And then in it comes over. Courtois and it's headed down and wide of the far post. John Stones was in there. Two goal John Stones against Panama. Very nearly got his name on the score sheet again. Yep he did. Very dangerous to set piece. It was great to leave Courtois came for it but then realised he wasn't going to get it. Went back the lane and it was actually Cahill got the header. Gary Cahill and it's behind. Did it take it a flexion as well? It might well have done. So Gary Cahill coming close for England. And Belgium with the ball in front of that penalty area with Boyatta of Celtic. A bouncing pass up towards Batuay on the half-air line but that's tied it up by Rose. He just actually caught Batuay on his follow-through but I think it'll be okay. Just a little reaction from him. 12 minutes played here then England nil. Belgium nil. And England with possession again at the back. Despite all of the changes John Stones keeps his place. Gary Southgate after the relative lack of football that Stones had Chris during the latter part of the season. He's been his man all the way through the warm-up games. Stones kept his place and even when the changes have been made here Stones has continued to keep his place. Eric Dyer who's come in for Henderson in the central role and has also taken the captain's armband from King. Alexander-Arnold now lifts one across and Vardy with the header. 8 or 9 yards out managed to escape his two markers but headed it wider the far post by 4 or 5 yards. Good move, good ball by Dyer. Alexander-Arnold takes off very, very early. We know Azar's not a wing back. He's playing a little bit too high. He's trying to catch Alexander-Arnold all the time. He's chasing him. Vardy would be disappointed, didn't hit the target. Going back to the chance that Keahal had from the corner. England getting joy again from set pieces. Corners this time. Traditional strength of course of the England team going back. Well almost as far as you like. But they are a threat. I think Belgium at the minute when they get good possession which they will as the game goes on because the pace drops. You can tell when they get the ball they're good on the ball. I know they've rested a lot players but even this team they've got out of the deck. Very good on possession. Without the ball like the team what normally plays they're not the best. You can get at them. England nail Belgium nail. No yellow cards. So with that being the situation if it stays like this England would be group winners and Belgium would be runners up. Here's Fellainy finding a bit of space centrally playing it out to the right hand side. Where again Yanisai in that lazy fashion of his. Real Sociedad now is his club. Plays the ball with his left foot to the left hand side. Here to Torgan Azard. Bruce and Munchen Gladbach is the team that Torgan Azard plays for now. Having been a Chelsea youngster. Ball on the right hand side again with Chadley who may well move on after the relegation of West Bromby. This season Nasser Chadley. Now for Marlon. Again to the left hand side and then Jones steps forward and dispossesses Marwan Fellainy. Who puts in a challenge but it bounces kindly for Vardy and Vardy now looking for the run of Rashford. Both of the edge of the area. Courtois comes right out and scoops it up as Boyatta runs across Rashford. Decent pass Decent Rohnberg good talking by Courtois. The defenders were aware that he was around and he's obviously called for it and they've left it. What sort of combination is Alexander Arnold heads the ball back to Pickford? Would you be looking to see Chris tonight from Vardy and Rashford as England's front two. Rashford's got to be the 10 and Vardy's got to play high. Vardy especially against the three. You expect to get down the sides of the Marlon who's not getting any younger. Doesn't play a lot of football. Vardy should be playing slightly on his right hand side and getting down the same as much as possible. England nil Belgium nil likewise in the Panamartian-Isia game. Earlier as we know Poland were already out but won 1-0 against Japan who also go out because Japan had a through despite their defeat and Senegal leave the World Cup after their defeat against Columbia. England in possession inside their own half. Alexander Arnold leaves it for Eric Dyer the ball almost at walking pace. Now Reuben Loftus-Cheek. Quite surprised Chris to see Loftus-Cheek in the team bearing in mind he's on the yellow card. Yeah again, same, same. Trying to get him into the cock. He's been quite quiet. You've got to say he's got a lot of ability but he's been quite quiet in the game. He's making a run now towards the edge of the area. Dyer tries to pick him out but it was intercepted by Torgan Azard. And then Jones dived in on centrefield on Dembele, England off on the attack. Referee Damia Scamina one of the top officials in Europe brings it back. I think rightly for the foul, 3K Belgium. Yeah he just gets in, it's a slight challenge late by Jones in the number of free's to give it. But Belgium just can't get any rhythm. Yeah they've had two good chances as well. The shot was a good effort and the scramble with an early score. Kale kicked it off the line. Apart from that they've not shown a great deal. Borda line yellow card. That challenge by Jones which is something we're going to have to keep an eye on tonight. Bat Shuaia heading it back trying to find Fellaini. 25-30 yards from goal but Eric Dyer was there. And Belgium have got the ball back inside their own half. So far we've played just over a quarter of an hour. A couple of chances. Gary Kehoe with a back post header that was deflected wide. And at the other end a shot from Telemans that was saved by Pickford. And then a bit of a scramble that Kehoe was able to scrape away from the goal line. So still 0-0 in the sunshine here. And Telemans manages to get away from Dyer. And Telemans' little pass is intercepted on the edge of the penalty area by John Stones. And England are away with Reuben Loftus-Cic who is up-ended by Fellaini on the half-way line. Free kick. Referee Scamina is going to call him across and says... There's your warning. Cut it out. It's a warning. There's your warning. It's 2-0 in the game. He's giving me yellow, isn't it? They'll be looking at towards the end of the game. Ref will be aware of this though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So... You know, it'll be well over... He will know exactly what the score is. Telemans looks a decent player. I know he struggled in France in Monaco, but he came on last game for them. Looked all right. And today he started pretty great as well. Yep. He was tipped and picked out as a great young star in his very early days at Andalect. Yuri Telemans played in the Champions League when he was only 16 years old. And now, as Chris says, at Monaco, still only 21. So an opportunity for him tonight in the World Cup. 0-0, BBC Five Live, beautiful evening, and Phil Jones in possession. Turns, plays it out to the right-hand side to Alexander-Arnold, who swills, went in. Oh boy, that's an awkward height for him, but he was in two mines there, and he actually almost headed it away at thigh height. And now, Danny Rose. Ref says that's not a foul as Rose wins the possession back, and then Rose is blatantly tripped by Telemans. That is a free kick. And it is the yellow card, first of the game to Belgium. Well, Danny Rose did ever so well. Yannisai dawdled on it, he took it off him. Good strength. I see that there's air. Just thought, yeah, you've gone past this, but you're not going to cross it. So he takes him down, takes the yellow. Can't help but be suspicious. But, yeah, that had the yellow card written all over it. Yep. England-0, Belgium-0. And we heard from Christophe Therreur, our Belgian journalist friend before the match, who was absolutely adamant that Belgium want to remain in the Moscow area, because that's where their base is, as well as it being what you might call the easier side of the draw. That is if you finish second in the group. And now England have got a significant fair play advantage with two yellow cards in their favour. England-0, Belgium-0. This is going to be swung in by Alexander-Arnold from out on the left-hand side. Raises his left arm. Alexander-Arnold then hits it in. Good delivery as well, but it is safely and securely headed away for Belgium. Batchouai challenges for it. And now Yannisai presents it back to Alexander-Arnold, who's ball over the top for Vardy. Boyatou came across, got a touch on it and sends it out for a throw in the other corner flag on the far side. 0-0. I think England's appetites there, and you can see that they're really contesting everywhere all over the park. Good tempo about them. Belgium, I'm not so sure. They are playing very slow. They're giving the ball away. Chibney, a basic play-in-half pace at the moment. Jamie Vardy looks red hot. Doesn't he? Finished the season very well, ended up with 23 goals for Leicester this season. Rose takes the throw in to Delph. Rose with the ball at his feet, and Rose was offside when Delph returned. He had to say things like, I don't get this level as well. He should be looking across the lane, and it turns for Belgium to slow the game down again. So it is 0-0. And as I say, already today, one team has gone out of the World Cup on the basis of losing out on the disciplinary record. Semicore going out, and Japan going through. And the group winners will play Japan. What are your thoughts, Chris, on the relative strengths of Japan and Colombia as opponents in the last 16 years? Colombia have got players up and turning on. They've got a variation of play-out. I wouldn't say they're outstanding as 11, but they have got players up and changing the game. If our goal is on his game, he can put the ball in there. Sometimes he's not on his game. We've got a lot of talent players. We're out as far as Japan. I think that's all about the teamwork. The energy levels they show. They're a little bit naive, it seems. But technically they're very good. They like to play high tempo. They work ever so hard. Belgium in position. Halfway inside their own half. I'm with Garry Southgate when he says, people are talking about England will go there, and they'll go there, then they'll do this. He was saying, we're not in a position, England, to pick and choose where we go and who we might want to play. It's only two of nine knockout ties at tournaments. This is World Cup and European Championship since Euro 96. It's a long time since England won at a tournament against a team that is ranked higher in the world than they are. Which is what Belgium are. Belgium third in the world, England 12th in the rankings currently. As John Stones took a little bit of a gamble there against that Shuaib that was able to find the pass to Jones. But Belgium have one possession back now as they play from right to left. The tall, unmistakable figure of Fellaini back into the back line to Dendonka. And now Chadley to Telemans. Telemans thought about going for long pass. Actually goes 360 and then finds Chadley who over hits the ball through badly to Jordan Pickford. This is not the best belzer performance we've seen. I think the starter quote, barely got shot 25 yards in a scramble. They keep it away, Dyer. Now Dyer's given it away. Chadley gets a chance to make up for his earlier error. Here he is again, Chadley. Now to the right-hand side. Yannisai up against Rose. Beat him the last time in this position. Back onto his left foot goes Yannisai. Then it's cleared into the area by Telemans but Rose recovered and Fell as he cleared it away right-footed towards the half-way line. Of course there's problems with Yannisai. We know him. He's obviously drifted around, lost his way a bit. But when he gets one-on-one, especially in that last 20 yards, he is dangerous. England out of possession. Belgium have it. England against Belgium at the World Cup. But inevitably for those of a certain age, Christopher, makes you think of that game back in 1990, the David Platt volley in extra time. And actually I know you did a little feature on it with Terry Butcher and Mark Chapman this week which I think is available on a podcast. Yep, it is. Is it the take-match of the World Cup? No, it's not that. No. Let's see. We haven't done one of them for five minutes. Five minutes? I know, it's amazing. I'm surprised producer Gary hasn't been onto this. Here's Dembele. That's for your smart speaker users, incidentally. If you say take me to the World Cup, you'll hear all sorts of things. The ball is out of play on the far side. Kailah's passed by Belgium and it's become a little scrappy, Chris. It's not the best, let's be honest. I think England's played quite a good tempo and they are trying to... Basically, they are trying to score goals and create things. The tempo's quite good from England. But Belgium, every time they get it, they just want to play keep ball. And of course, there is the danger as well. We've talked about that, disrupting momentum. That would be the case if you lose this match. But Fomarlin in possession inside the Belgian half, plays it to Boyatta. Now out to the right-hand side, where it's played back to Boyatta. And now Fomarlin just crosses the half-way line. Great chorus from the England supporters inside the ground. There are Red and White flags of St George draped on almost every level of this stadium. One of the smallest stadiums, 35,000, the capacity here in Kailanengrad. And Boyatta, as Belgium continue to keep possession in the centre-third of the field, plays it to Fomarlin. Now Togen Hazard on the left-hand side. Rashford puts Fomarlin into pressure. So he goes all the way back to go keep a croatoir. It's got all of the makings there, so it's not being a thriller minute for Boyatta. Now to the left here to T-limits. But also, you know, there are the signs as well of players who really do know that they stand a chance of winning a place in the team. Like Rashford, the way that Vardias thought as well, I mean, has started as well. Obviously these players have great belief in their own ability. And the fact that they might be able to win their place in the side for the knockout stage. Here at the back is Den Donka. And now Yannisai does well against Rose, plays the ball through to Batuaie. Batuaie to the edge of the penalty area, into the box, shoots from an angle. And a sliding stone sticks out a leg and sends it behind for Belgium corner. Well, Belgium get a little jid on right-hand side. Yannisai's got the beaten-up Rose every time he's picked up, he's caused problems. Obviously deep, he doesn't look comfortable. Once he's getting that last third of the pitch, he's got a trick, he can get past Rose. That's why he goes good change of pace and great blocks out to the first corner for Belgium. He was something about an expected selection, wasn't he? Adnan Yannisai, not really pulled up trees at Real Sociedad. But here he is and he's done well here, starting at this tournament for the first time. It's a corner and it's an out-swing and curler. It's Chester down by Fellaini, shoots, who's brought by a defender, Alexander Arnold. I think Pickford might have had it covered. The ball still not cleared the penalty area. And then Keelam hits a shot from outside of the penalty area. Dyer wanted a foul as he was challenged on the edge of the box. Referee Skamina ignored that and England have actually fired it away downfield for Vardy to chase. And it's Vardy in possession who goes back to Rose inside his hand. That's how Vardy's grew up. Big scramble there wasn't it. Belgium did fancy their chance. Fellaini's really strong in the air. Great by Fellaini, Chester did it down, shot, it was on target. But Alexander Arnold was able to block it. It's out of play for three into Belgium. And the score is England nil, Belgium nil. Yeah, Fellaini did ever so well, cleared away. I think Pickford had it covered. It was a bit of a scramble. England get it away. When Belgium do one out up the tempo, you can see the quality they've got. And I know they've rested a lot on their team. But this squad is a very strong squad for Belgium in this tournament. I remember when we were in the Kremlin when the draw was made, as Rashford now takes it up, gives it to Vardy through the middle, loft his cheek, looking to find Rashford with his aerial cross. It's just a little beyond him, but Rashford was able to get a touch and also did well to keep the ball as he was put under pressure on the left hand side. Rose uses Rashford and back it goes towards the halfway line where Eric Dyer actually will chip it out here to the right hand side. I remember when we were in the Kremlin and the draw was made, producer Gary was with me there as well. We were licking our lips at the prospect of this one at the World Cup, as loft his cheek now takes it strongly towards the corner of the penalty area, turns back to Dyer. Dyer's chip to the back post is nodded away by Yangozi who is back in there. And now Fabian Delphi thought he was pushed. He was. It's a free kick to England just inside the Belgian half on the far side. It's a hard game to call you on at the moment because England have a little spelly up the tempo and they look quick. He thinks something's going to happen and Belgium really are strolling through the game. They up the tempo and they've had two or three really good chances. You always think something might happen when this tall, slim, Manchester United man, Marcus Rashford is in possession. A sort of expectancy that you can hear around the stadium rises when he has the ball at his feet. But this time his possession results only in a throwing on the far side. Two rolls, takes it back towards the halfway line where Gary Cahill chips the ball across to Jones. Now loft his cheek back to Phil Jones. Jones puts his foot on the ball and finds loft his cheek who turns infield. Loft his cheek who looks up, sees John Stones coming forward, rolls it across to him. This is good possession from England. This is what Garas Southgate wants to see from his England side to have possession and use the pace as well. Moves the ball quickly and Cahill chips one again out to the right hand side where Jones has got space in front of him. And Phil Jones can cross the halfway line and Jones can pass it up to his club mate Rashford. A couple of touches from him. Then back to Alexander-Arnold. Now Rashford turns away from Dembele and he heads towards the edge of the area and he passes it into the area via a deflection. It doesn't fall to the feet of Vardy and Belgium just clear it away where it rolls out of play for a throwing. He's unlucky Rashford. He's getting some good areas of Rashford. He's just dropping off that back three. Nobody really wants to go in here with him. I think England could get the ball to him a little bit earlier and he's always been available. I don't know about you, I'm seeing it as a direct contest between Rashford and Sterling. Yeah, of course it is. It's difficult. You know this game is... Those who have rested players and England have rested players. It's a good opportunity for them. If Rashford can come up with something special here then that gives Garis Salisgate a real decision to make for the last 16 game. Whether it's against Japan or whether it's against Colombia. The group winners will play Japan. England, Belgium Nill. We've played half an hour here and England are on the move again. Down the right hand side, Loftus Cheek into the path of Alexander-Arnold who goes for goal. Oh, he did not. That was a ship cross. Dropped just beyond the top corner. Courtois was bewildered by it for a moment. That was a cross. He's shanked, he tried to wrap his foot around it and he's missed it and it's definitely not. If that goes on as the board in front of you as a shot, you've got it wrong. You can see him all of the time actually looking in the field. Almost at the point where he hit it. However, he very nearly scored. England Nill, Belgium Nill and Delph is hopping away from a challenge from Thielenans near the centre-circle to free kick to England. Nill Nill. Diop, little pass to Alexander-Arnold. Feel like a million dollars won't he, Chris Alexander-Arnold. 19 years old. Come from nowhere. Now here he is playing in the World Cup. Unbelievable story. In Russia. It really is. Having played in the Champions League final. Now back into the central area, the John Stones. Care Hill, looks for Rose. Now Fabian Delph working tirelessly as he does. Does really well, Delph. Finds Rose. Rose chips it on and is caught laid by Dendonka. Then it's a free kick in the Belgium right back area. And a yellow as well for Dendonka. The Belgian fans are cheering. The Belgian fans were cheering the yellow card for their man. Yeah, they are. Oh, listen. Yes, they definitely are. As Jimmy Greaves used to say, football is a funny old game. It is. Free kick for England. So that, and they've got a big advantage now, that's five yellows to England's two in the tournament. Can't believe it. Can't believe it. Not goals, chances, what's going to happen to one of our yellow cards. Two man wall for Belgium. Trent Alexander-Arnold again in possession. He's seen a lot of the ball on his World Cup debut. And he's standing with his hands on his hips. Referee Scamina is giving Azard and Batuaia an extremely good talking to. About what they must do in the wall and what they must not do. And now the referee spotted some man handling inside the area. He's pointing to... Chadley, I think, is the culprit. Free kick to England on the left. Alexander-Arnold drives it in, takes a deflection off that two man wall, which carried it wider than the near pause and behind for a corner to England. After all that. Well, see if he can put a better delivery in from the corner. So this is the match that will determine who will win the group and who qualifies second from Group G. The last night a group action at this World Cup. Alexander-Arnold with this latest corner for England from the left. Right footed in, Swinger, which is headed down and wide by Lofter's cheek. Seven yards out. Difficult one that George wasn't it really. Batuaia stayed down, wasn't he? But there's a good movement from him, it's a good place on it. He's actually got to come away from the goal. He's getting his shirt pulled slightly, which has ripped. And he heads the chub, he's pulling his shirt. And really trying to turn it on the target. That was a couple of yards away. So it is a goal kick for Belgium. England nail, Belgium nail. England. As Belgium are looking to take this goal kick out from the back. Lofter's cheek and Rashford and Vardy pressing very high against them. And now Ball Downfield from Courtois. Actually hit the back of Jones. Fellaini then was able to get at the Yanisai who hits a shot from 25 yards. And a Yanisai turned immediately to the referee. And said that clip the heels of the England man on its way wide and it is a corner. I'll probably say, the game so far, Fellaini's been the best player on the park. But he's really played well on those and he's really put himself about. Corner on the right hand side for Belgium. It is going to be taken by Torgan Azard. Azard out swinging corner towards the near post, Batouai heads it across the box. And it's picked up on the left hand side, possession by Dembele. Dembele, little ball in field now, Telemans is there again. Dembele sees in a central area. Torgan Azard and then a very good challenge from Danny Rose to win the ball back from Telemans. And Rose allows it to run back towards the edge of the penalty area where Alexander-Arnold hits a long ball down field. That is chested down and Vardy. And now Rashford in possession. Rashford looks for Vardy with the chip but it was just a little high for him. And Boyatto was able to come across with the challenge and just do enough to nudge Vardy off it. And so Belgium are back in possession. Pressure by England, the win in the ball back and Vardy there was just a little bit too high for him. Decent ball Rashford did well to get the space, deliver but just a hell of a tinnity, far too long. He did a bit more pace on it. England, Nill, Belgium, Nill. And Belgium approaching the half-way line again with Vermaulen. Now infield from Azard, Jones steps forward, Dembele though is there. Just ahead of Vardy on the half-way line Dembele up towards Fellainy. A little heavy from Jones from behind, just forward and left of the centre-circle. Free kick. Team mates are manning out here, Jones gets too tight. Fellainy has been very effective for Belgium, he's probably been their best player for me. He's been strong, good in the air, his movement's been good. Just caused problems. Free kick, where it's going to be taken by Telemans. Batuaie, central, Fellainy's there as well. And it goes to Fellainy who heads it across, an important header away, but only to the feet of Fellainy, square from him to Batuaie. And then Tolgan Azard, slightly off-balance, tried to curl it goal-wards and bent it well wide and well high. And behind for a goal kick. And Panama, I can tell you, are leading by a goal to Nill against Tunisia. So that, obviously, the target for Panama tonight to win their first match at a World Cup and a 1-0 up on Tunisia. That's what it is, as we said, dead rub-out with both of them heading home tomorrow or the next day or whenever. So, Chris, Nill Nill here. Yeah, Fellainy there does well again from the set piece, brings it down. The link to play with Batuaie, who's looked quite lively as well, as our shot high in Wade. So there's not a lot of report on the game, you've got to say, John, it's... Belgium are playing in such a slow tempo. England's trying up the tempo, trying to force something, make something happen, but it's not. Throw in to Belgium, down in front of us, Torgan Hazard, waiting to take it. Just in front of the England dugout, throwing, taking down the line, Batuaie into the full-back position. Just has a look in field, he's on his right foot, Torgan Hazard makes a run, Batuaie goes round stones, crosses, pulls it all back out of the penalty area, actually, but there was no one there in a red Belgian shirt. And Jamie Vardy was able to get the touch for England. The ball is just as cheap, shrugged off the ball by Dembele, and Belgium have got it back inside their own half. Dembele potentially a Belgian player who will be playing for places in their side in the knockout stages of the competition. But when we were shivering in the Kremlin in December, thinking about this game, thinking about De Bruyne and Hazard playing against the England players like Harry Kane and Kyle Walker, and they're all sitting on the bench watching it because of the circumstances. Van Marlen sends a pass forward into the full-back position, Torgan Hazard plays it across, T-Lemons now with the yellow number 17 on the back of his shirt, Delph was able to close him down, but Chadley in possession now on the right-hand side, Chadley goes for the aerial cross towards the back post, Torgan Hazard hits it across the penalty area, but no one was able to get a touch, and in the end it runs out of play for a goal kick near the corner. They're very patient about them aren't they? They don't just get it in areas and say get it in the box when they get a certain part of the pitch they go back out, they're waiting for an opportunity, they are dangerous, and I know they've made a lot of changes as well, but you can see if people were Hazard playing and Lukaku on form, you can see what a threat they do with Cully. The studio have asked us to confirm that we used the term shanked cross when Trent Alexander Arnold nearly scored at the cross about 10 minutes ago, apparently it sounded like something else, I'm not sure what it sounded like, but we have clarified that. Five minutes to go to half time, England nil, Belgium nil, here on BBC Five Live, when we'll continue to bring you all of the matches over the course of the knockout stage, there's only 16 matches to go after tonight, Chris Bull bouncing forward, Vardy through the middle, but Kourtwa was always favourite to come out and gather at, which he did. This is where it really hot-tops after this, isn't it, these 16 matches. That's what the tournament's all about, it's very cagey, the group games, you know that nobody wants to lose, nobody wants to go home early, these two have got the luxury that they're already through, but it's well being documented, well debated, who wants to finish top? It's a very distinct draw though, isn't it, in terms of the two sides of it, like they've got Spain and Russia playing one another, Croatia-Denmark, Sweden-Switzerland, and Colombia against either England or Belgium in one side of the draw, whereas the other side of the draw absolutely live it with former winners of the World Cup in Uruguay, he'll be playing the European champions Portugal, France playing Argentina, Brazil against Mexico, and then Japan against one of these two sides. It is very different, isn't it, very clear cut those two sides of the set. Whoever you get, John, if you're going to win a tournament, you know, it's any cup competition, you're going to get some good teams, strong teams, teams you don't really fancy sometimes, but they turn up and they perform. Roars on the left-hand side for Delph, Delph swings the ball over, headed away by Boyata, comes out to loft his cheek, his first touch was a little heavy, and he had space actually, but in the time he had that touch, Togan-Azard was all over him, and Togan-Azard then gives it away through the middle. So it's played back to Alexander-Arnold by John Stones, Alexander-Arnold, Dembele comes across and closes him down, and the ball runs towards the dead ball line, and Dembele should clear it. In fact, Dembele beats Alexander-Arnold, the Belgian supporters enjoyed that, they're giving it an au lait. I think Mar-O-Anne-Fallain, he got an au lait there as well, that doesn't happen every day. Well done Mar-O-Anne, and now the Marlin plays it across the back line, where Dendonka will run it away, and that's exactly what he does, he's over the half-way line, the right-sided central defender as he is in this match, Fellainy, now to Togan-Azard. Back towards Dembele, and Belgium have got it again inside their own half. So England-Nil, Belgium-Nil, if you have been at work or at play, and you've just got back into your car, and you haven't heard, both Garret Southgate and Roberto Martinez made a raft of changes for this match, eight for England, nine for Belgium, so these sides very different from the teams that started the first two matches. And now, of course, it whistles around the ground as Belgium have possession in the central third. Well, don't get me at this game about Nil Nillen. He has Yannisai on the right-hand side, though, up against Rose again, that's been the contest of the match so far. Nilsai beats him again, shoots infield, but it hits, Cahill bounces down, and England actually could be off, or Alexander-Arnold just waits a moment, gives it to Dyer, back to Alexander-Arnold who turns and will actually pass it back into central defence to Jones. And now indeed, Pickford as well. And England start from the back once more. Lovely, orangey Baltic sunshine glinting on the white and grey metalwork at the top of the stand, very distinct rectangular roof at both our heads with Alexander-Arnold down on pitch surface, rolling it infield towards Loftus-Chi. It's been quite strange actually to get used to going one hour back from Moscow. So here, we're one hour back from Moscow, but we're one hour ahead of the UK. Things like that easily confuse me. Here's Dyer, back to Alexander-Arnold, with the ball just in front of where Roberto Martinez is standing. And then England go back into their own half, and increase in whistles, which I imagine are possibly from the locals, the Russian supporters who've come here to see this much anticipated World Cup match. I think we've got a point, to an extent. I think the game's been flattened. I think we've had a couple of moments, Belgium had about two or three half decent chances, I suppose in England's, of course, a threat on one or two occasions. But basically, both teams are playing with no risk. Everybody thought coming here was going to be nearly the way they were talking about the game, and it looks like it's going to be a bit of a loss. Stones gives it to Loftus-Chi. Now Alexander-Arnold, possibly the one who's done most of further his course. Loftus-Chi curls the ball in, but Boyatta under pressure from Delphi's able to fall and head it away from Goal and behind for an England corner. So another set piece, which is, I think it's good for England in this scenario, to try the set pieces that at this World Cup have brought great success. Alexander-Arnold, who has taken all of the set pieces, whether corners, free kicks in the match so far. Here he is, Alexander-Arnold with his latest corner to the near post, which is cleared away by Dembele quite comfortably, the first defender. And as it's played forward, someone in the crowd blows a whistle. Now the referee is doing the whistle, there's no added time at the end of the first half, and that's it. Bang on, 45 minutes. I think to be honest, if we'd all sat here and wrote down in a suite what the score would be, it'd off-time. I think everybody wrote a 0-0, and that's how it's gone. I think there's a couple of chances, England and Belgium, but you can tell they're both through, and they're playing very cagey, and it's a non-event for me. England have had opportunities. K-Hill's header, I think, was the closest that England came. We saw the dipping shot from Thieleman's, Fellaini with the shot that was blocked, the one that was scrambled away off the line by K-Hill, and Ruben Loftus-Ciek actually with the header was the best chance for England, but it's panning out pretty much as the pre-match conversation went. It has, and yeah, what we all thought about this would be the result, and it is. So, half-time here in Kalingengrad, England nil, Belgium nil, and back in Red Square, I suspect Mark Chapman will have some questions. Oh, that was terrible. That was nearly as bad as the first half. Well, welcome back to Kalingengrad, everyone. England nil, Belgium nil, and the New Year's Day's England are making a change, and Harry Maguire's coming on, and John Stones is going off. So a change in half-time. We can't tell, obviously, whether that's been pre-planned. As I mentioned, the fact that John Stones has actually started now 11 England games in a row, obviously an important part of this England team, so I suspect that was the plan all along, and that it's not a niggle, but we'll find out from Garry Southgate later, Chris. Yeah, I think that was all lined up. I think John Stones is out there working game time, but yeah, I think that was all planned. Kale's gone into the middle now, and Maguire on to the left. So the England team now, that's the first change for either side in the match. England with pick-fitting goal, three central defenders are Jones, Kale and Maguire. Alexander-Arnold and Rose the Wing-backs, Daya, who's the captain tonight, with Loftus-Chick and Delphi on the side of him, and Rashford and Vardy up front. You've just spotted a shot of Stones on the bench. Yeah, he looks alright, he's just starting to dugout watching the game. And the Belgian side, Courtois, Dendonka, Boyata and Vermaullen, Chadli Dembele, Fellini and Torgan Hazard, and then Uri Tillerman's Adnan Yannisai and Michi Batchowai. So England nail, Belgium nail, if you weren't listening in the first half, just to remind you that this is all about who finishes first and second in this group. And at the moment, a draw would mean that the two teams would be level on points, goal difference, goal scored, the head-to-head would be the same, so it would come to the disciplinary record and already in this match, Belgium have picked up two more, so they have five, England have two. So it would be England finishing top of the group, and England would play Japan on Monday night in Rostov, where we had a little look earlier on, and the temperature tomorrow in Rostov is forecast to be 39 degrees Celsius. It did say it would get a little cooler by Monday. England nail, Belgium nail. You'll need to get that laundry done, Chris, by the time we get to Rostov. Definitely, it's 39. The wash is only 30. You were adamant, weren't you, when we went to the Launderette? I said 40, and you said no, 30. I shrank 40, don't trust it. Stones has got some strapping on one of his legs. I've just passed the nose. Belgium coming forward, 0-0. You have to see the first opportunity of the first of the second half. Now, Yannis Ai, he's done quite well, Adnan Yannis Ai against Rose in the match so far. He has Batu Ai, 30 yards from goal, plays it back to Dembele, and Dembele goes back into the centre circle, by Atta, to Thomas Vimalen, who's winning a 67th cap tonight. There will be so many more, we're not for all of the injuries that he's had. Jones plays it back to Pickford, who quickly got the ball out of his feet to his left, and chips it towards Danny Rose, who is beaten in the air by Yannis Ai, and it's out for a throw into England. Already on this trip, on the subject of laundry, I've lost three socks, which is an achievement in itself. England, Vadi wins it back, gives it to Rashford, who goes for a curler, but he didn't get the bend on it that he was after. We were, as Jimmy Armfield would say, right behind it, and it just didn't come back in at all. Yeah, he didn't wrap his foot around it, did he? It was the right idea, he used the defender by Atta as a target to bend the ball around, but no, he's hit it too... He's saved for no bend at all on it, so it goes for a goal kick, short one. England, Nell, Belgium, Nell, Belgium with the ball at the back, and it's being passed forward, but straight to Harry Maguire, who stepped forward to good effect, actually, rose now on the left-hand side. Rashford, he does well. Brilliant run into the penalty area, and then eventually the challenge came in, but Rashford in fact pushed Dendonka, and it's a free kick to Belgium. Yeah, he did it, great bit of skill to get the space to get into the box. He's right on the touch lane, goes past two, three defenders, and not as well to be fair, he gets by across the many ends and push them to the floor. And mentioning Jimmy Armfield, incidentally, who of course died earlier this year, we lost Graham Taylor last year, great colleagues of ours who've been at many tournaments, many World Cups with us, the fact that it's the first World Cup since then, I was meaning to make a mention of them, and now is a perfect opportunity to do that. I'm sure their families will be very much missing them at World Cup time. Delph is caught in possession, Tillerman's taking it on, Tillerman still tried to play it off, and Maguire stepped forward, he couldn't find Yanisai, and it was cut out by Maguire, who brings it towards the halfway line. Danny Rose now, Rose is running between two of the Belgians, and Tillerman's slid in there, having already been boot, Rose went down no free kick. He got on here to the box, I think he's done quite well tonight in midfielder, chartery up, roll Yanisai in, under hit the pass, but he works back hard to get the ball back for Beausen. Yeah, there's Dembelli in the centre circle, Roberto Martinez making his nine changes, go to Southgate eight, it's going to be brought forward by Chadley towards the edge of the box, Batuay now takes it on, and Yanisai on the right hand side turns, gives it back now, to Tillerman's on his left foot, thought about a shot, checked it back, gives it to Yanisai, he puts his foot on it, oh, Beats Rose, brilliantly and curls it in, and Belgium have taken the lead. They're now on course to go top of the group, and that was a quite delightful goal by Adnan Yanisai, who beat Rose, all ends up and curl the shot past Jordan Pickford into the net to make it England nil. Belgium won, I've got to say that is fair quality, I saw this kid play years ago, I thought he was going to be a superstar, I did when I first saw him play the Man United, it's never happened for him, he's lost his way, he's ended up playing in Spain, he's given Danny Rose a hard evening tonight, you've got to say every time he's picked it up, he's looked dangerous, he's always got the beat in, he's put a few crosses in, this is brilliant, just drags it, bends it with his left foot, Pickford absolutely no chance, Danny Rose is on his heels, can't get back across him, wraps his left foot around it, top corner, what a goal that is. It'll be interesting now to see how Belgium play from now on. One nil, Belgium lead, so it would now, if it finished like this, it would be England, it would be runners up and would play Colombia in Moscow, and it would be Belgium who would play Japan in Rostov. The ball is played back to Pickford, well how will the two teams react? England now, he's getting beat, you've got to try and get back into the game, the ball's gone out, Pickford's kicked there, it's gone out at Farside, England's got now to take the game to Belgium because at the end of the day, as it is, Harry Kane's getting his shin pads on, so he must be coming on. Interesting twist that we weren't expecting. Well as Alan Shearer said, every player going out on the pitch, Janusz, I wanted to score here tonight, Janusz, I wanted to do that at a World Cup, and he's done it, and now he has Loftus Chief bringing the ball forward powerfully, strongly, and he's bundled over centrally by Dembele, and it's a free kick to England in a good position centrally. And Will Alexander-Arnold take this as well, he took every piece tonight, good run by Loftus Chief, Dembele does bring him down, it's a good, it's middle of the goal, it's what, 30 yards? Good opportunity. It's England-Nil, Belgium won, very, very good goal by Adnan Januszaj in the 51st minute, but Eric Dyer won this free kick to play, so now I can see Tunisia have equalised against Panama in the dead rubber incidentally, Fajr Ben-Yusuf has scored the goal. Eric Dyer picked up the ball, remember him scoring the free kick at the Euros two years ago against Russia, this is a little further out, it is quite central, Delphi's there and Alexander-Arnold, I think Alexander-Arnold's got it, I think so too. It's a big wall and there's three English players done on the end of it, trying to block the goalkeeper's view. So Alexander-Arnold, this is certainly 25 yards out, just slightly to the right of centre, and almost, all but about four or five of the outfield players are in this wall, hits to one of the widest walls as Alexander-Arnold swings it, predictably, into the wall. Delphi, back towards the half-way line after the ricochet off the Belgian wall, and Pickford strikes this downfield, it's helped on by Dyer, who I think might have been caught there by Vermeerlen. He did catch him slightly, he just held the ball on, but Vermeerlen just came a little bit late, Dyer's alright, he's getting up, referee Scrimina spotted it, so the free kick has taken short. Certainly from an England point of view, they've got, clearly they're old Fellini, does his Zinedine Zidane turn to get away from Delphi and from Vardy, played back to Courtois. Courtois strikes it long towards the half-way line, Harry Maguire wins the header, now Delphi hoists it forward, Vardy was in an offside position, so it bounces through to Courtois. Interesting, I can't tell what Southgate thinks now, because he's won down, and I've got to say, Belgium are quite up for it at the moment, their tempo's good, they're moving the ball quick, wonderful goal by Zinedine Zidane, I've got to say it was a real top-class goal, just trying to see, just getting in my feet to see who is warming up. Fetting him down there, actually youngers out there, Danny Welbeck as well, he now is the only England player, the outfield player in this squad who hasn't been on the pitch at this World Cup. England, though loose possession, Lofter's cheek was shrugged off the ball, now it's been taken forward by Torgan Azad, he exchanges passes with Batchewy, Azad, now into the penalty area, the Anazide, who went for another shot between the legs of Maguire this time, but he was able to close them and block it out for a throw. That's what they're good at, Belgium, you've been watching this tournament, I know these players aren't even playing with Wendeltsen, Azad normally, they really break quickly and get the ball in, the Brauner set some free and they're off and they really play with pace. The start of the second half, very, very well. Five live with England at the World Cup, we're live in Kallenengrad, listened as well by the BBC Sport app and the website, World Cup Daily Podcast will be available as it is every day of the tournament, there'll be a new one when you wake up in the morning, as Jamie Vardy fouls for Marlon on the far side and it's a free kick to Belgium. The World Cup Daily Podcast tomorrow will bring you the interview that I'll be doing down in the tunnel after the match with Gareth Southgate, whichever England players I speak to, that will be on there and Mark Chapman also will be talking to Alan Shearer and Dion Dublin on the five live World Cup Daily Podcast tomorrow morning and Robbie Savage's World Cup Breakfast will be on as part of the wider breakfast programme, Rachel Burden will be involved in that from six o'clock in the morning UK time, she'll be here in Kallenengrad as she is inside the ground, I can see her from where I'm watching this match in the commentary position and also Paul Gascoigne is going to be a guest with Robbie Savage in the morning so don't miss that between half past eight and nine o'clock, Gazan. Ball hit long and forward from the half-way line for Belgium, Azad is tangling with Alexander Arnold and the ball eventually bounces out of play and that is given as an England throw, just chested back to Alexander Arnold who then volleys it high downfield towards Vardy who wins a header and Varmalan goes down holding his face and Vardy and Varmalan have clashed heads actually because Vardy is rubbing the back of his head. There's blood I think on Varmalan, I'm sure they just saw it, there is. Oh yeah it's a gash on his forehead and yeah just back of head on forehead, he's hit the back of Vardy's head as you say he gets up a bit late, Vardy tries to flick it on and he heads the back of his head and unfortunately he'll have to lose a pitch. Yes he will, he will receive lengthy treatment now, I would expect he is setting up for Varmalan, he's okay they've obviously got a check for the concussion but it was a crack on the front of his head and the crowd attendance has been announced here 33,973 and a good proportion, officially something like 3,500 England fans inside the stadium but I think they're all on that. I think they're all on that, I think they're right, I think it's all on the bottom tier really and I think a lot of people do wear England shirts who actually live in Russia. So at the moment it is England near Belgium 1, Adnan Yannisai scoring the goal, Thomas Varmalan is still receiving treatment here, so England would go to Rostov to play Japan in the last 16, what am I talking about, England would go to Moscow to play Columbia in the last 16 on Tuesday so they would have an extra day and then the route after that for England and obviously that is a tough enough game, England would then go to Samara for the quarter final, worthy to beat Columbia and then it would be back to Moscow again. So it's the easier route in terms of travel as well but this is not finished yet and Varmalan still receiving treatment, so it's a tough game in the field and Jamie Vardy plays the ball all the way back to Kourtois. So Belgium are playing with 10 men at the moment. You said before John didn't you, Belgium are on beating what, 20 games? 20, yeah. They want to keep that rock going as well. That's your eye, wins the header. Now here is goal scorer Yannisai, really excellent goal, BBC highlights later if you get the chance, Adnan Yannisai and Donka receiving the pole. I think for Marlon it's just about ready now to come back onto the field, he's just having a swig of water on the far side of the ground. It's lovely temperature here, but near the Baltic coast on an evening like this it can't be any more than what, late teams, something like that warm enough to sit and watching short sleeved shirts if you've got any still clean enough. As the ball goes back to Dembele who turns and runs it back into his own half and gives it to Kourtois. It is 20 degrees here in Kölnengrad. I am informed by Gary. Here's Fellaini, the offside flag, up on the far side against Torgan Hazard and it's a free kick to England. And now we're seeing this, it's become a bit of a theme this hasn't it during the course of the World Cup matches. The chant of Ruff Sia, which tends to go about now doesn't it, without an hour gone in all of the matches. I don't know whether it's something that's been choreographed. England with the ball on the right hand side with Loftus cheek, does well into the penalty area, takes it to the byline, chips it across, takes a double deflection and in the end is cleared away by Chadley for Belgium. Fellaini put under pressure, England win the ball back, Jones, Alexander-Arnold gives it back to Jones who overhits the cross across the face of goal and beyond the far post for goal kick. Another cross shot that was. I'm surprised, I actually thought England would have really upped the tempo, started asking more questions, taken a bit of a risk, a little bit more risk. They've actually sat off the pace, letting Belgium just pass the ball around them. You've got to say this is the first team, I know England's made a lot of changes, I've Belgium up, but this is the first team they've played and may I say I've got a bit of quality. Yeah, good. Is it fair to draw conclusions from this match tonight when these teams that have been picked for tonight have been selected? Yeah, well you've got to think, yeah England might say you've got Ari Keating coming in, we've made a difference in front of goal, but I've really created a lot of chances. But maybe another one or two, but when you're talking about people like Hazard coming in, that's a massive difference as well, massive. England have got to be careful here, but they are nicely played away from the back by Maguire and Cahill and Delph. And now Loftus Cheek has set away over the half-way line and he's off and running and he has lots of options and he gives it out to the right-hand side. Alexander Arnold looked as though he might have been offside. Why did he just put his flag up? And then the flag goes up, free kick to Belgium. Why did the weight, he's like three yards offside and he stands on weights till action, something else happens and he takes up with me on the arm now. I'm almost afraid to mention it, but in the first referees briefing they did say that they were encouraging the assistant not to put their flag to the tight decisions. That wasn't tight, no, that was like 20 yards offside. Is that tight? It's 1-0 to Belgium and at the moment England will be heading to Moscow for that game against Columbia because they're losing by one goal to nil. England with Loftus Cheek. Now Rashford, challenged by Boyatter and Boyatter bounces off Rashford who's left on the ground and Belgium played away from the back and that was possibly a little late there by Vardy on Fomarlin as well. But referee Skumina allows it to go, Delph, the outside of his boot. Vardy spreads it past Rose here on the left-hand side. Rose goes past Chadley, crosses towards Vardy, important touch from Boyatter, played across the back line. Dembele will have to clear it away, Torgan Hazard though in a tight position there against Vardy turns away and clears it up towards Batouay on the halfway line. Belgium still leading through that very good Yanisai goal. Batouay and Telemans together, now Fellaini on the left-hand side, comes back from Torgan Hazard to Dembele. And Belgium dropped a walking pace. Just controlling the game, managing the game very well. If it's a counter-attack chance on John, they go for it. If they don't see it, England getting the ball quick, they decide to keep the ball, slow the game down. He has Yanisai again with Rose. Yanisai up against Rose once more. This is Telemans running out of play. Actually it's quite a rare win for Danny Rose in that particular contest and Rose has thrown it to Maguire who has Yanisai all over him. Maguire just well though uses his strength against the much freer in terms of his build. Yanisai holds him off and then chips it away downfield and Belgium have to go back into the run. I don't know what to go through Martian as I said. He actually must have thought, this is the, you know, well it's well documented, he doesn't want to win the group. That's what he's quoted as saying from yesterday. But you know when Adnan Yanisai scores a goal like that, that's good for the team collective, good for the confidence. But Telemans chips the ball out of play and it's the throwing to England half way inside their own half. And of course, you know, if England are disrupted, if their momentum is disjointed by this display and we know that that happened two years ago at Euro 2016, you know, there will be questions to be answered. But we'll only really know that after the piece, won't we? Maguire passing the ball along the edge of his penalty area, Pickford just scampers out, little pass towards Jones who brings it up towards the half way line. Alexander-Arnold now back to Phil Jones. And then England start again in central defence with Gary Cahill. The only man in this squad, when it was named, who'd won more than 50 caps, 61st cap that he's winning tonight, Gary Cahill, the much decorated FA Cup winning captain of this season. Rose now on the left hand side just in front of where Roberto Martinez is watching. Gaia for England who took the captain's armband tonight with Harry Kane and as yet unused substitute. Gaia makes himself available to Jones, but Jones goes back to Alexander-Arnold on the right hand side. No urgency, John. They're just passing the ball and Belgium's thinking, well, do you actually want to win the group? He was interested because you're not taking any risk. There you go. There's Bardi. Slips the ball through to Rashford. Rashford is clean through. Rashford shoots wide. Save. A little touch from Courtois. Could have been much of one. One-on-one, clearest chance of the match so far for England and Rashford is denied by a touch from Courtois. It seems. I don't know if it was as good as the corners we'd take. The corners have been taken, but Azard, Poggan Azard swings it back out for a throw on the first leg. He could have done anything there. He could have lifted it, placed it. He could have went round the goalkeeper if he wanted to. He was clear. He's trying to hit it really early. Whatever had hit Courtois, Han or his boot, it went great. Nice combination though from Bardi and Rashford. Bardi should have a solo. England 0, Belgium 1, which is a similar scoreline to when these teams last met in the World Cup back in 1990, when England won by the only goal of the match, the famous David Platt volley. Here's Maguire, who's going to swing a high ball far to the England right. Alexander Arnold as well, actually. Little poke to Loftus' cheek. Fabian Delton possession. He's going to shoot, you know, left footed and he slices it badly wide and he holds his head, actually. An anguish goal kick. Belgium 1-0 to Belgium. And this is Chris Waddle, who played in that game back in 1990. Just watching the replay of the Rashford chance. There was a bit more tempo about our game. No, Rashford, great chance. Courtois, it must have hit the end of his glove because it just went past the post, but he could have done a lot of things, but it was a great move. Bardi, Lincoln, the play, very, very well. England 0, Belgium 1, BBC 5 live. So we are on course for England against Columbia and Belgium against Japan in the last 16, because Belgium are winning this match and will win the group. And Telemans now in the centre circle plays it to the right-hand side to Chadley. Chadley looks for the run of Yangers-Eye. Oh, he's just got to it ahead of Yangers-Eye. Killed the ball, actually. And now Maguire will step forward from the back and hit a long pass over the top, looking for Rashford. Courtois comes out and calmly allows the ball to bounce and skip through to him before Rashford could get there. Dembele, away from Ruben Loftus-Chik. They're like two middleweight boxers, those two, aren't they? They're up against each other, Loftus-Chik and Dembele in centrefield. Now Yangers-Eye on the right-hand side back to Telemans, and Telemans goes out to the left-hand side to Torgan Asar to bring that ball down on his right shoulder. No place in the team for Eden Azard or De Bruyne. Incidentally, Lukaku, I don't know whether you're spotted at half-time, Chris, as Fellaini heads the ball out of play on the far side. Lukaku was warming up, and he was going through a series of exercises on the pitch, which is good news for Belgium after the start that he'd made, but then picking up that ankle injury. But when the teams came out at the start of the second half, it was like a testimonial down there. The clubmates saying one another, he actually embraced Marcus Rashford. He put his arms around him and gave him a proper hug. That wasn't a corner. There they are, still looking at it. Tunisia have taken the lead, so Tunisia lead Panama by two goals to one. So that in the match, they'll both be going home, they're both going out after the group stages. Panama took the lead, but Tunisia winning two-one. As the final group matches at this 2018 World Cup, Marcus Rashford is off on a little run out towards the left-hand side. Rose was there, now back to Delph, Rashford, back towards McGuire near the halfway line. There are 20 minutes to play, and the approach of England in this position will be very interesting to see. One nail down, which means they go to Moscow, if it stays like this, to play Columbia, and will be in the same quarter of the draw as Sweden and Switzerland. They would be potential quarter-final opponents. Daya plays the ball out towards the far side to Alexander Arnold. Alexander Arnold beats Azard, and then a left foot across to the back post. Rose nods it across, it took a header away, Delph hits a shot. It's deflected by Boyatta, which took it square and away from goal into the full-back position, and Chadley will complete the clearance. In fact, he keeps it in, gives it to McGuire, and England can start again. The England band drumming at their rhythm as Daya's pass over the top is too strong into the arms of Kouatois. I think England's got a lot of possession. Belgium have just dropped off the pace, and they just want to keep the ball moving. England are offering little going forward. There's no imagination. Yes, there's a lot of running around in China-spinning areas, but there's no quality. England nil, Belgium won. There is a 6-0-6, by the way. Tonight, we'd love you to join us as Fellainy takes the ball on. There's a collision there with Eric Daya. Fellainy's been fouled, it's a free kick to Belgium. Daya committed the foul, but I think he was also caught in there as well by a hand as Fellainy went down to the face. I think he might have a scratch on his face. He's okay, he's just putting his hand through his cheek. It's a free kick to Belgium out on the left. It was deliberate, we just saw the replay. The referee has had two cards out already for Belgium, but Daya gets away with one. Free kick then. That's Hawaii, in the absence of the injured Lukaku. Fellainy obviously a threat. Yanisai is going to take this from out on the left flank towards the left side, curls it into the penalty area. Daya's able to twist, unchallenged to head it away. Damballe then back centrally towards Telemans, who places a high pass into the penalty area, but it's easily caught by Jordan. He's in a way city could have gone, and a couple of passes in there before he puts it in the box. Belgium in total control of this game. So one now, Belgium still lead that goal early on in the second half, where Yanisai did extremely well, beat Rose, and then hit a glorious shot beyond Tickford and into the England net. The only goal of the match so far. England against Belgium, England not lost in their last 11 games against Belgium. He has rose on the left hand side, then back towards Rashford, who is challenged and beaten by Fellainy. Does well, good composure from Fellainy. He could be an important figure for Belgium if they go far in this World Cup. And out to the left hand side now to Fomarland, spent much of this season injured. Fellainy if you remember, and then Fomarland's long passes way beyond anyone else. That's why we didn't give him an option at all. He thought it was going to spin in behind, he's played it long for his pace, he's come short. You're right Chris, we're going to see Vincent Kumpenig coming on. You said that at half time, he looked as though you'd be ready. Certainly Roberto Martinez before the match, when we heard him give his FIFA interview, suggested he wasn't going to play. He suggested he wasn't quite right to start, but he is going to come on. And again, like Fellainy, company could be a very important figure for Belgium's World Cup run. Company who's yet to play at this World Cup while he's recovered from that problem. He has Delft for England. Delft trying to play through La Vardy, who couldn't get around. I think it was Dembele who was back in there, and as a result it was played back to Kurzweil who clears from the ground and bounces out of play, and I think we might see this change now. This is it, yeah. For who? Boiata or Vermaulen? I think it's going to be the number three of Vermaulen that we can see it is on the board. We saw a little preview of that. So it is Thomas Vermaulen who relieved the field, he did take that crack on the head, and he's okay, he's got heavily greased right eyebrow. We can see that on the screen here as he's walking off the field. And down below on the pitch, company waiting to come on. There's applause from Vermaulen, the 32-year-old Thomas Vermaulen. And now the captain of Manchester City, Vincent Company at 32 makes his first appearance in this World Cup here in Russia and takes his place in the centre of the Belgian defence. Boiata goes to the left-hand side of the three. I think there will be plays, I think Martina will be happy the way Vermaulen has come through it, he looked good. Vincent Company winning his 78th cap for Belgium tonight, the president as they're calling. England, Niel, Belgium won, 15 minutes left to play. Rose plays the ball down the left flank for Rashford to chase, two England players have gone down there, Rose and Vardy, and the free scumina says it was a free kick for the challenge and Vardy, which was slightly off the ball. Good angle again and Alexander-Arnold comes across, I'm sure he's going to bend his right foot, tells him how to hold in a very high lane, this is what, 25-30 yards, this left-hand side from the by-lane, and it's just about 14 yards from the goal. Chris Waddle with us on five-life, we're watching England attempt to come from behind. It will be England against Columbia in Moscow in the last 16, but if England equalised that would change. Just keep an eye on the big man, Maguire is at the far post, Eric Dyer's taken a position near the penalty spot, Gary Cahill is there as well, the referee's pointing to Eric Dyer, just making the point, but he is in an offside position. Alexander-Arnold plays it in, Maguire at the back post, heads it across, Courtois comes, and is able to collect it quite easily, just took a black glove up and poked it out of the air and sends Belgium off on this latest counter-attack with Dembele, who is quickly surrounded by white England shirts, and passes back to Boyatta, who's attempted ball forward, is blocked out of play by Vardy for a throwing on the far side. This is a set piece, well worked again, Maguire spins around the back, which he's done on many teams or in this tournament, but he's headed back across goals too high. Easy catch for Courtois. There's a threat in there, Maguire, isn't there? Yeah, he's got very dangerous throwing to Belgium on the far side, near the halfway line, we've seen one substitution each so far. They've got Eddyn Hazard warming up now, hence the cheers from the Red Devils, the Diabla Rouge company. Played it from the back, especially from Mark Chapman, he'll have enjoyed that. The lines are open by the way, 606 tonight, 08, 085, 909, 693, to talk about the team that Garas Southgate picked tonight, and did he do the right thing, leaving out Harry Kane, and what about the prospect of playing against Columbia? Here they'll come, Belgium with Fellini on the left hand side, who crosses into the opposite full-back position, however, Belgium still in possession with Chadley, I think we are going to see Danny Weldback coming on very shortly for his first taste of this World Cup, and Janerzai is then challenged, unbeaten by Delph actually, and it's out of play for a throw level with the edge of the penalty area. The outlines open 08, 085, 909, 693, Kelly Cates is going to be hosting the programme tonight from Red Square, our studio in Red Square, Terry Butcher is going to be with her, getting touch as well, and we'll be back with a 5-life sport at BBC 606 on your social media, or you can text on 85058 to talk to Terry, and to Kelly Cates about what lies next for England. At the moment, what lies next will be Columbia. Here's Dyer to Delph. Delph, long pass high over the top down the... the England left, Chadley stumbles, that's because there's a little snudge by Rashford, and it's a free-kick. Yes, a substitution. Weldback coming on for Vardy, is it? Nope. Weldback is going to be coming on in actual fact for Trent Alexander Arnold. Hmm? Just an interesting one. So what are England going to do here, Chris? The messages play, Loftus cheek. Actually, it's Rashford's going out to that right-hand side, Rashford to a right-wingback position. Well, what do you think of that? Well, no one expected to see that here. Never seen that before, that's a new one. Well, there's something to talk about on 606 for starters. Marcus Rashford now, with Trent Alexander Arnold going off, is playing in a right-wingback position. And Danny Weldback has taken a position up front at the moment through the middle with Jamie Vardy. Must have been something that they've been thinking about. Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland, England, Nile, Belgium won. They've saw something. And we have got just over 10 minutes to play before 606. We're bringing the interviews as well, live into 606 from Gareth Southgate. I must make a note of that to ask him about. Rashford is right-wingback, but here Loftus cheek has been shoved over. Challenge from behind, free-kick and a good position out towards the right. Well, Alexander Arnold has gone off, so who's going to take it? Is it Rashford? He fancies it? Well, he surely will. Yeah, why not? It's from round about the position where he scored from open play admittedly against Costa Rica with that brilliant shot. Well, there's a lot talking here. Who'd be wanting to shoot here, Rashford? There'll be a lot of them saying, look, I'm going to spin round the back. Can you clip it to the far post? There'll be a lot going on here. Belgium are winning 1-0. Referee Scamina sprays out the line about one straight outside of the penalty area. As I say, it is towards the right. It's right of centre. Four, five England players have been in discussion about this. They've all now begun to walk away. Eric Dyer, captain on the night, has left it to Marcus Rashford. And Loftus Cheek just standing to the left of the ball. England players have taken up positions on the edge of the wall. K. Helen McGuire is definitely going to shoot. And so Marcus Rashford is ready. England 1-0 down, heading to play Columbia, but it'll change up the equaliser. Rashford goes for goal and whips it over the bar, but over the wall as well. A little hop and a skip by Courtois, but he knew it was going over the top. Yeah, good goalkeeping, good position as well. You know, sometimes the movie just... He always had a cover. He didn't need to touch it. It was always going high over the bar. Didn't trouble him at all. Got a south gate. It's more like waistcoat weather this evening, isn't it? As opposed to initially Norfolk Road, where it was sweltering. Down there, we can see him in the blue shirt, waistcoat on. But at the moment England are heading to defeat, which will be their first defeat for over a year. Fellainy plays it over the top, but that's beyond Batuai. Pickford's got it. Fellainy was excellent first half. I've got to say he's had a very poor second half. He's not really won his battles. He's not used the ball well. He had a really good first half. We're in the last 10 minutes now. And it seems, if it stays like this, that we'll be following all of the England fans. If anyone to come and join in with this World Cup party. And it really is quite an atmosphere and quite a thing to behold this Russian World Cup. Well, they will be accessible in the last 16 because they'll be in Moscow if you can get your hands on a ticket. England nil, Belgium won. And now Harry Maguire steps forward and lifts the ball over the top with an angle into the full-back position. Rose catches up with it, chips it round the defender. But then there's a covering challenge as well from Ben Donca, who has deflected it out for a corner to England from the left. Another set piece. Yeah, I mean, England's having a goal, trying to get back into the buttocks. They're not trouble courts. There's not a lot of quality, John. For all, there's a lot of honesty. They've upped the tempo. They're working hard. And they're trying to make something happen. Look at little joy. There might be a set piece from this where they'll get the goal. Danny Weldek has taken up a position outside of the penalty area. He's winning his 40th cap tonight, Danny Weldek. Decent goal-scoring record for England. Now involved in this World Cup. But where's Harry Maguire? That's the key for the corner, which is taken by Rashford. Cordoire comes, gets a punch, comes out to Weldek, who shoots across goal and it's deflected wide by the right leg of Fellini. Corner. Yes, that's the best of second hours, but that was a very important touch, wasn't it? Cordoire makes a little bit of a mess of it, comes back in at the don't-of-order, went in the bottom corner, Fellini clears it, another corner. Rashford now the corner take-up. And here's the delivery. Cordoire, easy catch into the black gloves. It sticks. Almost as if they were made of India rubber. God, keep up. He's a very good goalkeeper, hasn't he? Imposing. Quite amusingly yesterday, I was watching them warm up when we were allowed into training. And Simon Minoulet actually mishandled a shot, and it hit Cordoire on the back of the head and pole-axed him. England nil, Belgium won. Here is Torgan Azard on the left-hand side. Still no sign of any further substitution. England have made two. But the intention tonight, the primary intention, was to rest players for the last 16 with qualification already secured. So we've not seen Kane, we've not seen Lingard, Henderson, Walker, Sterling. And the question will be 08085909693. Has anyone here tonight furthered their cause and made a case to be involved in the starting line-up against Columbia if indeed it is to be Columbia? No, not for me. So you can ask Terry the same question with Kelly Kate on 0606 on 08085909693. The lines are open. Here's Rashford, right-wing back Rashford. And corner taker and free kick taker now that Alexander Arnold is off the field. Back it comes to Maguire, now Dyer, Delph, Belgium very much sitting off England now. And Danny Rose then taking on Chaddly and crossing left-footed and headed away by Boyatter. Back out to the side from where it came. Danny Rose challenging and fouling Denbully. Referee says no free kick or at least he's going to play an advantage with Telemans in possession approaching the halfway line. Now Yannisai, little stumble from him. The goal scorer, Adnan Yannisai. And then Telemans challenged by Vardy and as a result gives it away. And now Loftus Cheek drifts around Boyatter so easily. And Loftus Cheek overhits the chip looking for Weldbeck and it just drifts over the crossbar and behind. That's a couple he's done tonight. Has a great position. Just standing up at the far post and he's miss-hit it yet again and he has a sub-murtains come on. Yep, second Belgian change. For Yannisai, it's going to be Mertens. Dries Mertens of Napoli replacing the goal scorer, Adnan Yannisai. He's had a good night. In terms of England players furthering their course. Yannisai has certainly done that with Belgium. I thought he's played with Dany Rose really well. I think he's had to beat them a lot of times. He's picked the ball up and what a goal. What a fantastic goal. Make sure you see it. So Belgium's number 13, the experienced Dries Mertens of Napoli who's had a couple of excellent seasons there, is onto the field. And Mertens, who had a little bit of a problem. I don't think it was any more than that, an ankle issue, but clearly it's not too serious because he's on the field now for Belgium. We're into the last five minutes. Five live Belgium winning by one goal to nil. And so it will be England against Colombia in Moscow on Tuesday night at 7 o'clock. And it means that England, if it stays like this, will be in the Sweden, Switzerland, Croatia, Denmark, Spain, Russia side of the draw. We'll bring you all of those matches in the last 16 of this world cup. By the way, on five live or on sports lecture or via the BBC Sport website. Every time one of those games is on, BBC Radio will be bringing you commentary. And now Danny Rose overruns it in field and runs into Anfels Telemann. So it's a free kick to Belgium. Rest day tomorrow, Chris. Back to Moscow for us. Oh, John, yeah, well, not for how long we don't know yet. There's still four, five minutes to this game to go yet. So we'll... It still will be a rest day tomorrow and I can guarantee you. Belgium with the ball at the back. Flick four, been given away by Chadley. So Rose is onto this. Rose taking on Dendonka, who just nudged him over. There wasn't much more than that and is a free kick ball. Free kick, which is taken quickly on and then it prodded horribly behind by Danny Weldbeck at the near post. What are you laughing at? Proded terribly. Right. Well, Belgium sometimes just cause their own problems, don't they? I mean, they've been cruising in this game. For all England have had a lot of ball and no quality. You've got to say England tonight in final third. Nothing can have been far from hitting Rachel Bergen. That effort from Danny Weldbeck. She's sitting over the hoardings behind the goal. England nil, Belgium won, remains the score with two and a half minutes plus added time to play. And Vincent Coomperny at the back. Back on the World Cup scene, playing the ball behind him to Courtois. And then Boyatta, who's gone out to the left-hand side since Coomperny came on. Oh, nicely done by Fellaini on the far side. Beatney, the right wing back Rashford, his club mate. And then gives it to the left-hand side where it will be hit across for Telemans, who squares up Merchants and Merchants with a shot that's well saved by Pickford, diving to his right. That would have sealed it, but Merchants is denied. But then a great piece of skill by Torgan Hazard on the left, hits the shot that actually hits his own man, Merchants, in the six yard box. I think that was on target and it was blocked by Merchants and it's out for a throw. It just shows you on the break. Great count. They're a great count, retakenside, aren't they? What a straight. This isn't a good save by Pickford. It's a good hate for him in the middle of the goal. He expects him to save. It's a good strike by Merchants, comfortable save, pushes it away. Belgium it seems. When they move on that counter, it's hard to live with. And that's where effectively the second team on the field. England, Nill, Belgium, won. So we're not going to see Harry Kane. It would appear at any point this evening. How do you imagine that he is feeling about that? Part of the team decision. And that's England. What are the finished second? The top scorer at the World Cup that he's being saved for the last 16, where England will be playing Columbia, unless there is a late goal. Jones to the right-hand side. To Rashford, who whips the ball in, takes a flick off the head of Boyatter, only half cleared away. Then Merchants is caught in possession by Maguire, but it's cleared further away by Belgium. Up towards Tiemens now, who has Dyer and Delph as well closing in on him. Between them, the Faldon. And it's a free kick. We've got only 20 seconds of the 90 minutes to play. Martínez has said some things which put him in question, but he does say he's got a very good squad and he all could play. The man is the game great tonight, Belgium. Five live, Paul Gasconi is going to be on Robbie Savage's World Cup breakfast in the morning between half past eight and nine o'clock at some point in that time. Three minutes of added time. We are into now. Belgium on the verge of making it three wins out of three, so it'll be a first defeat for England at this World Cup, in this game where both managers made a raft of changes. Eight for England, nine for Belgium. Lines are open for six or six as Tiemens slips it through now towards Chadley. Chadley plays it wide for Batouay down into the full-back area, the England left-back position. The shirt of Cale was being held there by Batouay. Batouay beats Cale, plays it across, bounces off Cale, merchants is in there, Pickford as well. It's a huge scramble and the referee says it's a free kick to England. It is a free kick. There was legs flying everywhere, it wasn't a people were jumping, jumping up, everything. Again, goes in great position. That's why he gets a little bit of good fortune on the bar lane, squares it, there's a massive scramble. They're all sharp holding it, Pickford's there, everybody drops to the floor and he gets a free kick. So, one nil Belgium, it remains in at a time. Two minutes to go, two minutes before we know exactly who England will be playing in the last 16. Looks like it's going to be a defeat here, unless... Here's Rashford, Rashford now playing it across the field, but it was beyond Delphine, it was a little short for Chadley, and Belgium have possession back. So, it's a little deep out, it would seem he'll be heading down to lost off in all of that heat as Telemans plays it across, Torgan has it now into the penalty area to Fellini, who hits a left-footed shot into the side netting, the outside of the goal. Brilliant counter attack again. They nick the ball, England are so sloppy at teams. We've talked about England, they're in the great World Cup so far, they've given it away again, but the referee says... This is the first team, I know England may say Kane's not playing and so on, so is not playing, Belgium can say the same, but squad-wise, if this is Belgium on far better, they'll technically knowledge the game, they've managed the game unbelievable, and every time they break on the counter attack, they look brilliant. We're here from Garro Southgate live into 6-0-6, and you can join in the programme with Terry Butcher and Kelly Kates on 08, 08, 5, 9, 0, 9, 6, 9, 3 to book your call, or on 8, 5, 0, 5, 8, and of course you can get in touch at 5LiveSport, at BBC 6-0-6, on social media. England, 0, Belgium, 1, and the ball at the back with the Belgians, and time is almost up here. Fellainy puts his foot on the ball on the far side, Belgian flag, the black and yellow and red is being flourished on the far side of the stadium, the Belgians are singing their songs, and referee Scamina just has a look at his wrist. The Belgium in possession inside their own half, and England are going to have to take the defeat, the Belgium are handing out to them here. Just one goal in the match, that very good Jan Isai goal early in the second half, as Belgium still with possession of the ball. Maguire though comes across, if there is going to be one final attack for England, it's going to have to come now. Pickford strikes it long downfield, but the final whistle goes, and this last group match here at World Cup 2018 has resulted in a 1-0 win for Belgium. So Belgium will go through as group winners, after three victories out of three, Belgium will go through to play Japan in Rostov, and England who just suffered their first defeat in over a year, in all of the qualifiers, friendlies, and now matches here at the World Cup. England will go to Moscow to play Colombia on Tuesday night in the Spartac Stadium. I've got to say I was very disappointed with England today, I know people said there's not a lot on the game, they've qualified, they've made changes, as Belgium had, Belgium far superior for me, as that game went on, every time they got the ball they used it well, they know when to go quickly, they know when to play slow. We were one place tonight, we try to go quick all the time we pick it up, we give it away cheaply, and now people are going to say we've left players out as Belgium have. But you've got to say Belgium's got a better squad in May-Eyes, and they've managed the game far better than England, and Belgium are a very talented side, and that's without people like Hazard and Lukaku and De Bruyne. So disappointing performance from the evening, and it's the first team England's played in May-Eyes, who are a good outfit. Yeah, Carousel's gate said yesterday, you know, you can't talk about England going a long way in the World Cup, because of the record he said, we need to beat top teams. But tonight it's a defeat that I think also underlines the great importance that the current World Cup top scorer, Harry Kane, to this England team. He wasn't involved, and the final scorer here in Kirlinengrad is England-Nil, Belgium won.",
