  "transcript": " Well thank you Mark and good evening to you 19 down, 5 to go and still the dream is intact. Last four days have changed the mood, tangible substance added to the wistful hopes of glory, the unseasonably cold summer air laced with optimism and further. Whisper it quietly if you dare. It is starting to feel quite real. The Germany game saw to that, a night that was pragmatic and cathartic in equal measure. The end justifying the means with the beautiful bedlam within Wembley mirrored around the country. A result that will live long in the memory in a way in which few Tuesday tea times ever will again. Sweet success, sweet Caroline, the sweetest of days. Locking Germany out of a tournament felt like a significant watershed moment. It was for one game, nearly the middle step on the journey at large. Tonight the task is to guarantee that the seemingly eternal wait isn't prolonged in the eternal city to ensure that all roads don't lead to Rome. But at the end of the clash London's calling, foundations laid for a potentially historic week under the arch. But these are heady Ukrainian days too. A first-ever European quarter-final secured with pride and persistence and almost the last touch against Sweden. Tonight the biggest game of their lives on the international stage. Their country's first visit to the last aid of major competition. Since they succumbed to Italy on a tough night in Hamburg in the 2006 World Cup. Andreshevchenko played that night and he featured in their only ever win against England three years later. Now recast from master marksman to mastermind, he's named this team for tonight's encounter. It's Busz Czannengol, Karabayev Sabani, Krasov, Matvienko, Mikolenko. Zinchenko, Szilvac, Shaparenko, Yarmolenko and Yaremchuk. Against the England side who revert to a back four from a three, Pickford, Walker Stones, McGuire Shaw, Philipsson Rice, Sancho Manstirling and Kane. And those England players before kickoff take the knee. England's footballing history is a tale of one high, the odd nearness, the occasional aberration. All punctuated by a myriad of quarter-final defeats. But remember Wembley 66 and 96, remember Naples and Samara and hope that Rome will soon be mentioned in the same breath. Because if England beat Ukraine, only Denmark will stand between them in the first major final in 55 years. England in white shirts and it might be the purest in me, but how great to see them in white shirts and dark blue shorts. They could give them right to left in this first half with Ukraine in all the other. And it is England with the early feel of the ball, playing it down for Raheem Sterling. In towards Luke Shaw and a long sleeve shirt, one of the few that is. Back from him to Harry McGuire and now John Stones. And then played out towards the right hand side where Karl Walker can receive possession. Over on that far touch line which is almost a bus ride away from here. Loft advantage point right at the back of the west end of the Stadio Olympic. And England play for Dad Awards Luke Shaw around the edge of the penalty area. Sterling trying to get the ball into feet. Couldn't take it with him as he turned and Ukraine will get it away. And it's a long ball, launch forward upfield. Lucky for Yama Lenkova, straight out of play for an England throw. Very positive compose, opening 90 seconds of the game here on Tortsport. Ukraine and England might be falling here in Italy, I know it isn't back home. Raheem's delighted to say we're joined by the former England captain, Stuart Pierce. Good evening Stuart. Evening Jim, just looking at the Ukrainian lineup there. They're quite happy to drop into a five when England have possession. It's a five three two. And when teams line up against you like that, it's really important you get that ball switched nice and quickly into our wide areas. Move the ball from side to side quickly and make the midfield three that are going to slide across. Do extra work trying to get there. If you do it slowly, the whole team shuttle across and plays too predictable. That is an area that England haven't always excelled in. Even within this tournament where progress has been serene at times, but still confident. Shaw playing it in. It's cut out in the midfield. But straight back to England again where McRae will pick it up on halfway. Lay spread towards John Stone. Stone's playing it out to can't walk around the England right back. He goes through the midfield again towards Calvin Phillips. England looking up surveying their options. Harry Kane beating out towards the left hand side of the penalty area. Sterling at the moment in a central position around the edge of the D. Sanjo making a dancing run out to the right hand touch line. The ball being worked back inside the centre circle again. That England just getting an early feel of the ball. Laying it out towards Kane on the left leg. Now the long quick accurate switch of play. Good to see. Out towards Karl Walker. Walker plays forward into the feet of Jaden Sanjo. An opportunity to turn inside the penalty area. The challenge comes in as a fair one despite the appeals that perhaps the referee should have a look at it. Mason Mount was the player that went down but they will go on and it's back with Calvin Phillips again in the heart of the England midfield. From him to McGuire. Down towards Raheem Sterling. Three and a half gone on talk sport at Nill Nill. Sterling trying to ride the challenge slips it in. It's Harry Kane. It is the perfect start for England. Listen to that roar around Rome. Three and a half minutes gone. And it's Ukraine Nill. England won one perceptive through ball inside the penalty area. Harry Kane has finished it. He got the Ronald Karabayev. And his ability and sharpness in front of goal did the rest. A long way to go. That is the perfect start as England have their noses in front of you. Yeah the creator on this occasion Sterling. Fantastic little dart and ball through. And when Kane went through he just lifted it over the goalkeeper. Skimmed off his chest and into the back of the net. Ukraine have started to go in very tepid showing England a lot of respect. And I think the ball hit in the back of the net will only emphasize the point. You're probably going to have to show us respect tonight. Again fantastic with Sterling coming inside and showing that quality. Just keep them doing that really. That great movement from Harry as well. So Harry Kane with the goal those are the thoughts of Stuart Pierce. And Sol Campbell to four man. England World Cup defenders with us here on Torch Spore. Harry Kane's goal scored four minutes from the end against Germany. Four minutes from the start against Ukraine. His first two knockout goals for England. How sweet they are. Eight now for an amazing tournament. All told 31 in his last 39 starts for his country. And again without wishing to tempt fate. When you're one nil up and you're a side that haven't conceded a single goal in the tournament so far. What an early shot of confidence of adrenaline. That is going through the veins. And you can hear the England supporters dotted around in there. They're hundreds rather than tens of thousands around the stadium. But it is certainly the England support outnumbering the Ukrainian counterparts tonight. And it is they who are in voice. Already Ukraine trying to get the full backs for that little bit more readily. Opportunity for them to bring it towards the edge of the penalty area. Yama Lenko wanted the ball into feet. Was it forthcoming? And sure is there to head it away. Well Southgate will field it just that controls it. Staring on the edge of the technical area in his dark suits. And internally he will be bustling with pride at the start that England have made. Started three of the four games before tonight. Very sharply hit the post in the first three. And now have hit the net four minutes in in this one. Ukraine, then England won on talk sport ball out of play. Sol Campbell for a throw on the Ukrainian run. It's okay. You know they've conceded and now Ukraine have started quite high up confident on the ball. It's almost you want to say well why don't you start like that? Who cares though? One nil to England. Absolutely. There's Yama Lenko playing the ball down the right hand touch line. And it should be easy for Harry Maguire to get there first. Takes it down towards the corner flag. Gets it away down towards the figure of Raheem Sturk. It's just only a little kick out. He caught Karavayev there rather than being able to play the ball. And it's an opportunity for Ukraine to test England's ability on set pieces. It is an area where Ukraine themselves defensively can struggle. Much better with attacking set pieces than they are defending them. Two of the six goals that they've scored in this tournament so far have come from headers. Ball being swept inside the penalty area. Now Jordan Pickford hasn't had a touch of the ball as yet. Just reaches behind the goal for a white towel that is discarded there. Drives his face. Just takes a little bit of sweat off his brow. It's going to be a free kick which will be swept in by Shaporenko. A little bit of the bubbling around on the edge of the penalty area. And optimistic appeals for a hand ball by those in yellow. Nothing given. It's back for Shaporenko again. Shaporenko working it back for Matveyenko. And now played forward through the midfield forward. So Sid Orchard. Can England be able to push out and just get Ukraine playing that a little bit higher? Interesting actually that the three Ukrainian center halves aren't playing the way around that we anticipated. They've got Matveyenko who possibly is the weak link playing on the right of the three rather than the left. The young Zabani giving that little bit more license to push forward on the left of the three center halves. Zinchenko's got the ball on the edge of the center circle. And it turns neatly and plays it back for Sid Orchard. Down from him to the dark head Shaporenko. Caravaya pushing forward from right wing back plays the ball towards the edge of the penalty area. Calvin Phillips can stick out a foot and knock it away easily. Since England took the lead with that early Harry Kane goal. Ukraine have had more of the possession hardly had a kick of the ball prior to England taking the lead on four minutes. Now more possession easier possession. Now they're working back towards the edge of their own penalty area. We're nine minutes in here in Rome. Is Ukraine ill? England won. Here's Stu appears. What I like about England's performance is Jim we seem to be seamlessly picking up good form from one game to another. You know we finish a game on good form with good confidence and straight away we run into the next game looking as though we're playing exactly the same way with no nerves with our performance, good passing, good understanding of positional play. And well we couldn't have got a better start in this one. England have one of the last four meetings between these two. That was in the Euros as well. Nine years ago Wayne Rooney scoring early in the second half in a game in the Dnyaks. England finished top of the group and Ukraine at finish bottom. Here's Luke Shaw in possession for England now leading courtesy of that Harry Kane goal which is his 36th goal for his country. Jim one thing I'm looking at here I think if the Ukrainians lose the ball and drop back into shape the one thing we can do is dictate the tempo of this game. I don't think they press particularly well from the front so we can dictate the tempo. The only time they'll get a touch at a ball potentially is when we gamble on it to attempt to go forward but that's the good thing we can take the sting out of the game at any given time that we want to. Sterling winning a throw laying it back for McGuire now the stones played forward through the midfield to Declan Rice who benches into Ukrainian territory. Ladies little one to a car walk against it back and then works it down to the left hand side of the back line for Harry McGuire and on towards Luke Shaw. Shaw's got Mason Mounties ahead of him. Calvin Phillips making a good run which has split the lines but the pass wasn't forthcoming it's worked back instead for Shaw into his own half from McGuire and back behind square from him to John Stones. Now it comes down towards McGuire again England with a man over on the right hand side the the ball out towards Karl Walker always on and McGuire plays it almost that far towards Declan Rice now it does come down towards Walker but Ukraine defending with a back five when they haven't got possession still defending quite narrow. Look as though they're susceptible to the quick switcher play Ukraine have turned possession over here Yama Lenko making a good run forwards Yeremchuk that's got the ball tall dark-edged striker working right for Yama Lenko who will want to cut into onto his left foot low ball into wants the near post Rice has come back and fields across from his club team they turn knock it away and it came almost won the seconds as it just looked as though they overplayed it in the midfield Ukraine but Sabali has it and has played it back for Matt Vienko he said the halves just switching around to their more customary format now for Ukraine and the ball played out towards the left hand touch line was over hit goes out it's an England throw which will be taken inside their own half in the right back position with 12 minutes in on Torch Sport it's Ukraine now England one of these are the thoughts of Sol Campbell I feel now with Ukraine I don't think they've got any energy but when they obviously you know get that kind of turnover you can see how quickly they can attack but for me England I've got them because they just seem dead on their feet got through 120 minutes of the game in Glasgow against Sweden which they won with a goal in the 121st minute it was the second latest goal in Euro's history young striker Goldberg coming off the bench and doing the damage against the Sweden side that have played just a little over half an hour of that match with 10 men certainly felt as an England fan that England would have more chance in this game if it were against Ukraine rather than against Sweden have the opportunity to make their way forward now with Walker getting towards the byline tries to deliver across which is well defended by the retreating Mikolenko but it goes out of play for a throw that England will take down by the corner flag over on the far touch line that's 13 minutes gone and it's one meal to England on a day where so far possession has been over the whole piece 50-50 although England dominated the early exchanges and Ukraine have had a little bit more of it since the goal went in Luke Shaw has possession on the England left Ukraine have only ever beaten England once which was in qualified for the 2010 World Cup a one-nil success and Rob Green set off very early in that game you know though Ukraine missed the penalty they still ended up winning one-nil. Shachenko played that day but the first ever match with Ukraine was the England's last ever victory at the old Wembley. Gower Southgate played that day and so did a Mr. Sol Campbell also playing in what turned out to be England's last ever win under the Twin Towers. I'm going to get back under the arch for two games over the next eight days that the main prize and 14 minutes in so far so good as far as England are concerned still got easy possession inside Ukrainian territory all over on the right hand side for England good combinations between Walker and Jadon Sanjo who's already played twice as long in this game as he has in the rest of the tournament combined. Rice now playing it back for Harry Maguire Luke Shaw on the left down towards Shaw a couple of yards in from the left hand touch line just forced back by Karavayev lays it back for Maguire and it's just simple possession as far as England not at a great tempo now it's given away one back by Matt Vienko Matt Vienko getting it looking to launch it long Yarmolenko had made a run into the inside left channel and the ball had been played to where he had been a couple of seconds previously it sailed just behind him and over his shoulder and goes out for well down towards the left hand side for England who can build from the back again it's Walker playing it down towards Sanjo good movement off the ball that time came from Mason Matt's gone out of play Stuart for an England throw with the three lines leading one now yeah it's crucial that England with the Ukrainians playing so deep and compact and we've sort of a narrow head if you like up to their two forwards that we play on the outside of them don't try and go through them certainly unless you're in the last third in their last third by all means try and Fred Little passes through don't give the ball away in the mid third though because they come alive Yarmolenko's look to go in behind on a couple of occasions your amchuk could do the same as well so no give away possession keep bodies behind the ball when we have to and only gamble the ball in the final third because when you've got your nose in front in these games you don't have to chance that ball because if they do turn it over as they've shown before they'll look to go in behind you as quick as they possibly can Yarmolenko just lost the house winning his 99th cup for the Ukrainians and I was good speaking before the game about the the immense patriotism that he has playing for his country it's just lost possession there Luke Shaw's got it on the left hand side just a yard in from the left hand touch line now that goal that Harry Kane scored incidentally England's earliest goal in the European Championship match is 2004. Pickford having to get down at his near post able to make a save from Yarmolenko just for a moment looked as though he's going to get in behind the England back line. The good goal scoring record it was an under hit back pass Walker looking to lay it back towards Harry McGuire didn't have the legs to get there and Yarmolenko with a tame ish shot in the end which Pickford was able to beat round the post and out of play for a corner as I was just saying do not gamble and give the ball away in central areas there's no need for it in comes the corner Ukraine's first of the game headed away England win the seconds as well try and divert it further clear but many yellow have won it back Karavayev just played by Matvienko through the midfield to the left hand touch line Mika Lenko making his way forward from left back and it goes back for Matvienko again certainly sent a heart but looking at the goals Ukraine have conceded in this game it looks as though you can not just run at him but you can probably run off him as well England haven't had the opportunity to to do that so far with the way that the players been condensed but Ukraine beginning to spread about a bit making grab towards the left hand side of the penalty area towards Yarmolenko who tried an optimistic little back heel flick around the edge of the box it's knocked away by Declan Rice and Ukraine will pick it up back inside the road 18 minutes gone Ukraine nil England won and a level here from sure appears a firstly soul Campbell it's concentration level as well you know you don't when you got so much possession you don't want to lose it and they don't want to lose your concentration make sure every pass is proper don't lose the ball concentrate 100 percent there's bases on the outside here tonight against these when they're out of possession they drop into that little pointed press deep lying we can dictate the tempo of when we play put the spaces on the outside of them and that's what we've got to utilize well when we finish here at the Stalio Olympic going Rome at 11 o'clock tonight Adam Cantor all and Mickey Gray will be taking your calls on national radio 717 double two double three double four is the number you get your calls then have you say on talk sport from 11 tonight and then tomorrow morning on the weekend sports breakfast is Natalie Sawyer and Tony Cascarino Ukraine had a play down an injury at the moment and it would be put out of play by Shapa Reinko just so they can attend to Caravane and see how significant his problem is he's just down on the it's Matt the Encore beg your pardon just down on the left hand side of the Ukrainian back line and it's going to be an opportunity for a few of the England players to come over towards this near touch line and get some drinks on board and get a few instructions on board as well so yeah you know this is a good time for garrisons to kind of hey let's keep it going list don't lose our concentration and use the width use that space on the side you know there's three of those guys in the middle of the park for the for Ukraine can't keep on shifting over but if you shift it over quickly you can you can expose a big time and get those one-on-one scenarios we'll bring your podcast to kickstart your day from talk sport tomorrow morning we'll be nailing the biggest talking points from euro 2020 with punchy personality in opinion all the biggest interviews from the managers and the players that matter and our England correspondent Faker others I can see in a red dress just behind the orange hoardings that isn't really doing it much justice away to our left hand side behind the goal at which Harry Kane found the net right in front of Faye about 15 minutes or so ago and all the reaction from those men that matter coming with Faye at the end of this game here on talk sport we're 20 minutes in and it's a ukraine ill england one Matt Vienko still receiving a little bit of treatment a little compress around the ankle but he's going to be okay and we'll be way back on in a moment and england restart play with the throw that is taken in maguire who just chips it for for the goalkeeper hulky bush and who led in seven on his international debut against france back in octo but who has kept the veteran andre pyatov out of the side ever since long before from bush chan england approaching the midway stage of the first half in game number five of this tournament as far as the three lines are concerned and they still lead by a golden ill still yet to concede a goal in the tournament a record which is currently what some 380 minutes in not too far short of six and a half hours now free kick to england take your short by shore finds maguire maguire to stones stones playing it through towards calvin phillips and now out towards walker back for phillips again who's ten yards inside his own half played at his left hand side for stones stones to rice and straight back for john stones again now maguire's got him he can play down to luk shore that was the cue for the early dynamic darting run of mason man who was furious that the ball wasn't played and just exchanges not unpleasant words with luk sure i'm sure but makes the point that that was the run and that was the time to play that particular pass to be able to turn the ukrainian set to halves but this is better from england able to break it for now with sterling trying to cut it onto his right foot shore on the overlap he's just played it inside the penalty area behind four players then a back pass which was a shocker read by michael enko before any of the england players could get there and they've been able to slam it up field but that was much better from england pushing forward luk shore getting into a good position down the left and england's sure just not able to make the most of it no they weren't as i say good turnover at possession both teams have demonstrated tonight that on turnover of possession they'll go and hurt you and so whether it's england running at them and getting at them or the ukrainians if they get a possession they will turn turn it over and try to turn you around and hurt you very very quickly so the likes of rye seat and certainly philips have got to make sure that at least one of them does not vacate that central midfield area caravaii i've just found there by luk sure it's a free kit which will be taken by ukraine that's georg pierce olcambulist former england team made alongside us as well here in the uh stadium olympica northern suburbs of rye we're at the midway stage the first half salt and denrace so far so good it's going well it's going very well um scoring earlier on good chances we just got to keep it going don't lose our concentration you know we've got to get sancho in a little bit more getting money out running out there you can claim and if we can nick the ball in the last in their third we've got great charts england just losing out in the midfield now melenko can't bring the ball under neat control of the bank pastor torten pickford chased after michael enko doing everything he can to close him down but not able to get there and england as pickford gets it away he can just calmly lay it back to him from calvin philips and now it's just tapped forward again for harry maguire england looking for the first semi-final victory they will ever have had in this particular competition that hasn't gone to penalties just the one success so far with a famous one against spain back in 1996 all three european championship quarter finals that england have played have gone the full distance and beyond to spotkicks since 96 beaten in 2004 by portugal and by italy eight years later in this tournament eight scheduled to have been played eight years after that england hoping that it's not going to go the full distance this time but all they have to do is hold the ukrainians over the next 66 minutes and england will be playing danmark for a place in the final danmark being the checks two on earlier here's luke shore for england getting towards the edge of the ukrainian penalty area shore picking up a yard in from the left hand side has a couple of options lazy back for harry maguire on halfway maguire goes back to stones stones just picking it up neatly in the midfield to carl walker and then played by walker how towards the england right hand side and the possession for garris south gatesman on the increase but shots still very much at a premium england haven't had an attempt on goals since harry gain score but the men in white and blue still have possession working down the right hand touch the ball just take a little nick goes out of play for a throw off nick elenco throw that england have taken quickly and they just revert to type again passing the ball between themselves walker the stones to maguire luke shore showing for it but sterling had just dropped that a little bit deeper trying to draw chaperonco out of shape in the midfield now maguire with the long switch out of the england right hand side where it's headed down by sancho walker trucks onto that now rice back for stones number passes in this move up into the 20s now agrada shore again england leading 1-0 harry canes 4th minute goal calvin phillips is one to throw which will be taken on the england left hand side midway through the ukrainian half and the fourth official just bolling the ball down for luke shore to take this throw phillips brook their referee dr phillips brook to give him his full title just look sure that he can't move any further forward than the edge of the left hand corner of the technical area in which uh chepchenko stands hands on hips at the moment throws a good one it's flicked onto wall dr hanes sterling can't quite work the angle for right footy shot although he did his best and it was ricochet the way yamalenko won it back look for yarencha now jordan pickford just look for a moment as though he wasn't sure whether he's going to leave that for one of his defenders but he has sent the 20 yards outside his penalty area and just making quick ground outside the box was enough to stop the ukrainians trying to charge down the pass and now pickford just looks across the maguire hands outstretched and says just calm things down everything's okay england work a long ball over the top sancho's offside and it's a free kick for that offside which will be taken by ukraine not too far outside their box 27 minutes gone ukrain nil england one torbsport yeah the front two in uh yamalenko and yaramchuk i'm not sure they really love going to press the defenders what they do is get you into a full sense of security they're sort of very languid with their movement at times then all of a sudden that ball comes near them and off they go they come alive and we've got to be very very mindful of that that we do not give the ball away in the mid third the mid band because if a goal's going to come from ukraine anytime in this game it'll come from something like that a loose pass turn over a possession and they have the ability to hurt you with some clinical passing and clinical finishing well notwithstanding harry kain's gold tonight ukraine has still scored more goals in this tournament than england have for six compared to england's five they've let it eight more than england nine more than england now sterling's done well good industry from him linking up with luxure on the left hand side and then sterling just caught there no complaints from kovitzov freaky he's given england's way and this is a chance to load the penalty area if they uh deem fit solkhan well it's a great opportunity now it's all about delivery now big guns are up there just get it into that zone and let the guys do the rest it's a sure standing over it the choir coming forward john stone's there as well well bush and the ukraine in gold keeper and his fluorescent orange just asking for a two-man wall and he's not happy with the position of it whether referee has put the spray down the players have been the edge across to the right so far that they're they're almost off that spray could be a left-footed out swinger from shore that is the delivery and it's far towards goal a header over the bar from harry kain a disappointing attempt just yellow shirts all around in making life difficult for him to time the jump and he's handed it over the bar by about a yard or so it's still one nil to him i think really you gotta you know those kind of balls you you want to hang in and around the six yard box give the guys something to kind of you know the goalkeeper got you have to kind of worry about is it can i come out do i stay in my line that's important really get into that zone ukraine have it at the back again play back towards sabani sabani certainly a player for the future he's only 18 just made his debut in october only made his dino debut in september fleet doesn't see new appearances at club level behind him but winning his 13th cap tonight he's hardly missed the game over the course of this season as they've just 18 years of age the right footage set to half we've got a nightmare ball back out from his goalkeeper there certainly not in the position he was expecting whether was shandy so he was going to try and play out from the back rather than launch it long and the net result of that is a throw that'll be taken on the england left hand side by luke shore and short as we've already seen on a number of occasions in absolutely no hurry to restart play match management certainly what you'd want to decide to be doing in these circumstances england leading 1-0 walker seven or eight yards inside the ukrainian half more than happy to go back again for stones stones to maguire so the ukrainian defense shuffle across as luke shore picks up possession that always leaves space on the england right for both sancho and walker if there can be a quick switch of play yama lenko try to win it back ended up taking a tumble the referee indicates that it was a coming together between the two players and no foul now england will be able to work it forward again with stones finding walker walker going out to the england right hand side once more jayden sancho try to take on nico lenko takes it down towards the corner flag nico lenko recovered well but sports has slated out of play for a throw that england will take only about three or four yards from the corner flags yeah as i say when we move the ball there's a difference between being patient and moving the ball quickly you can still move the ball quickly and be patient in your build up we've got to come out use the center arms and go around from side to side we showed him just a minute ago there when we try to go inside they've got a number superiority in that middle band of the pitch and that is a dangerous place to go you've got to be doubly sure that it is the right pass otherwise keep coming out keep dotting it across the back and switching play nice and quickly and i'd like to see look sure when the ball is on cold walker's side he's just coming in and narrowing off probably 10 meters i'd like to see him keep his width walker adzord sancho has been keeping his width on the england right hand side chipped over the top by him it's ricochet bottle nicely for england because it came into the hip of calvin phillips well england couldn't quite get mason now making a third man run past him to pick up possession sancho keeps it on the right hand touchline now a chance for england to work it forward again sancho getting a return ball around the edge of the box walker never too far away from him good one two between the pair of them sinchenko sticks out a foot can only dive further down towards the right hand touchline where a ball is fired in but despite sheer weighted numbers ukraine were able to clear their lines comes back out for luke shore shorter sterling on the edge of the penalty area sterling left hand side of the box is a great show of tempo gets back in plays across the edge of the c-share box nobody there cleared out for right search to shoot and he does shoot push-chan beats it away ricochet on the edge of the penalty area fired towards goal straight to the nearest defender by mount and ukraine will be able to get it out of harm's way from the back but that was much better from england than the england supporters here in the stadium olympic odie lighting in that song fantastic really that's what it's all about in around the box keep it live you know good shots sterling fantastic one-on-one that's what we what we want you know england one-on-one sancho sterling one-on-one in the box and then cutbacks and then we just need someone to connect now really well struck shot by deffelin reiss you certainly was he's got that in him fantastic finishing see every day at training and once he gets in those advanced areas given the chance he's got a very clean strike on him the score against iceland back in november the only goal that he scored in his international career so far you're not missing anything because ukraine have a couple of players down injured on just outside the penalty area it was just an awkward fall i think for kovitsov as possibly put his weight through his left knee as he came down there 35 minutes in there's gonna be a fair bit of stoppage time at the end of this first half and i think that kovitsov's race is run he's limping off very gingerly under his own steam but only now as he managed to make it towards the touch line and they're gonna have to make a change and it's going to be sehan kov who's going to come on so this could well be a change in shape because they're taking a center half on and they're bringing a winger on so whether they've already electing that maybe they need to change the shape they could play alternatively sehan kov over as a left wing back and jopnikolenko back in as one of center one of the center halves so i'll just keep an eye on that whether it's a it is a change in personnel and a change in shape as well sol but 10 minutes to go to halftime and still england with no undue alarms at one end and the key breakthrough at the other yeah now you know they're gonna play a flat back four there's gonna be a lot more space to help for for england to look in those spaces and and thread those balls in now so hopefully we're gonna have a little bit more joy in the last word see train changing the shape back to the back four that they started the three group games with that's about the enko has possession now on the left of the two center halves nicolenko certainly not showing any early attacking endeavor from left back but he will make his way forward over the halfway line now plays it in towards zinchenko zinchenko to the retreating yaremchuk who can turn around the corner very neatly for nicolenko now play through the midfield for the recently arrived sahantuk the israeli born winger just that takes a couple of touches deposits the ball at the feet of zinchenko ahead of him he goes into the feet of yaremchuk zinchenko will continue his run off the ball and he has it in space and he's played it towards yaremchuk left hand side of the area pull back for yarmolenko onto his left foot zinchenko will get a shot in that is blocked immediately and england will be able to get it away he played forward and uh feels for a handball against the sahankov and it will be an england free kick a little none of the head from the ukrainian substitute eight minutes to go to halftime that was a better move stewart from ukraine the passing triangle's on the left hand side of the penalty yeah but england getting enough bodies back to make sure that it wasn't an effective shot when it came in yeah it's important that both vriss and phillipson on that occasion mount fill the box when they have to drop in and ukraine just demonstrating they're a very slick passing team that will create opportunities if you give them time and space to do so just the one shot on target so far for ukraine that means that england have still only faced eight shots on target in the entire tournament up to this point very few moments of alarm all the way through since the start of the tournament i'm clearly a big one the other night with thomas moeller but that's been the the clearest opportunity nobody's been able to take rave sterling has uh just been caught and wasn't happy at all about the challenge this is a free kick that'll be taken by england england remember rice maguire and phillips of the players in the starting liner if england are successful they're able to hold on to this league they would be suspended for the semi-finals if they were cautioned tonight ukraine also have three of their starting lineup in the same boat england have possession inside the center circle possession for england still in the the mid 50s no higher than that but probably had the ball in better areas than ukraine have had it but wide out towards shore sliding in caravans been able to put the ball out of play and south for a throw that'll be taken on the england left shore has to just retreat into the ukrainian technical area to be able to get a match ball to restart play shore's 10 yards outside the penalty area fantastic good darting run off the wall there from mason mount but instead he's throwing it in towards sir sterling shore trying to buy a throw off caravans then wins it back as it didn't go out of play kane flick through shore is in the angle is tight he's pulled it back great turn sancho shot right at the goalkeeper got his right hands down to it as in ricochet back out the offside flag comes up anyway but much better cleaner crisper interplay around the edge of the ukrainian penalty area so great play really need more that you know because the plan of back for now there's going to be a lot of spaces in between those centre alves and the right back and left back encouraging moments do it certainly was if i well certainly rolling the clock back probably 50 60 years if i'd have burst in there as a left back i would have been sledgehammering at the goal and i think luke shore picked the the more difficult pass in some ways sancho still had a player to beat and his ability to turn and get a shot away was commendable but i think sure should have had to take in the shot and see what come of it you only go about 50 or 60 years so still when you're in the twilight of your career then that was at the back end yes exactly well done here's mattie enko they were to play the ball back we might be in different countries but you're still getting grief the ball played the left hand side of the england penalty area walkers very quickly got back goal side england leading 1-0 as they've done since the fourth minute we've now played 40 chance up for your m check left hand side of the penalty area works in yarmulanko was waiting and england had three players very quickly cutting the angle of the near post and between them they could smuggle it away for a corner but that was not great defend it was kind of almost you know allow it to get into the box you're crying so we've got to really watch that and be on it straight away i'm not sure what will could was doing there it's as though he was waiting for someone to come and help him out and clear it out where we're clearly it was he's he's ball to deal with stones that was able to come back in the end and then as the corner came in it swung over the dead ball line out of play before coming back inside the penalty area so it's a goal kick that'll be taken by jorgen pick for the weight of our right hand side crane nil england won on talk sports yeah we you know obviously we've got to get it back together again seems like there's a little bit of a disturbance going on now i don't know why walker allowed that ball to kind of drift to the ball line and almost caused a problem for england's he's playing beaten the switzerland and spain in the the nation's league but lost the other five games that they played in 2020 had a record in 2021 though only beaten by the dutch and the austrians in the group stage those the only defeats that they've suffered since the turn of the uh england hoping to make it three defeats in 2021 for them in one of the biggest games that they've ever played in their history first quarter final that they've ever played in this competition the only previous quarter final was in the 2006 world cup when they lost three nils to italy having beaten switzerland on penalties in the ground of 16 it was sweden that they got past this time with almost the last kick of the game at hampton park but england with their noses in front early today one nil it's great to have possession inside their own half but only just with map v enko map v enko working forward through the heart of the midfield england able to easily get it away bush shambles will come out sweep up just outside his box and play for again sabani nannis at orcchuk is it orcchuk back for a sabani again map v enko for for they were to come forward some 10 yards 20 yards playing it out was the left hand side sinchenko england with 10 back behind the ball as the majesty city man darts in it comes again towards yarem chuk nadiya malenko on his left foot tries to tease it over the top defensive header from john stones still falls inside the box great diving header away right for an effort through a crowd goes why but he was really well struck by shaper enko he's about 25 yards out probably put in a yard wide or someone pickford would have had it covered it was an excellent defensive diving header in there but england just for a moment beginning to look stretched and it's the first half and here's its conclusion there's a little bit of defensive sorting out adusia there is but you've got to give the ukrainian's credit they're very slick around our last third they really are yarmel enko's an intelligent player they've got good movement good technique and i hope i'm wrong when i make this statement on the grounds that we've not conceded a goal so far i have a feeling looking at the game that we might need two goals to win this game frame in possession again back inside their own heart and since the harry kane gole one in england have only had one further shot on target which was the ever the bush sham is able to beat away so they couldn't guarantee the clean sheet notwithstanding the fine defensive form that england had been in mentioned it earlier there have been six separate occasions in england's history that they've come into a match on the back of six straight clean sheets which is the national record on all six previous occasions england have conceded in game number seven haven't conceded in game number seven so far tonight there's just been a few nervy moments and the final minute of the stipulated 45 could easily be four to be added three or four at the end of this first half ukraine bring it forward again yaremchuk has linked up the play very effectively yarmel enko stands on the edge of the d's in chenco is in the d the furthest advance of the ukrainian players england with everybody back behind the ball even though the ball itself is only 15 yards outside the england penalty area caravayev played back to shaper enko just as england forces to retreat into their shallow a little bit more protecting this league going into all tough times an excellent ball for caravayev the right back unable to supply another good pass looking for yarmel enko and england could get it away three minutes at the end of this first half sancho's done brilliantly writes the first challenge then the second as yarmel enko had a little nibble i think that as he lost his balance he tried to keep the move alive by finding mason mount didn't do so and the referee said there was no advantage and england will just be able to draw breath as they have a free kick on halfway 30 seconds through stoppage time it's ukraine nil england wants all camp great skill by sancho just shows you know his quality when he's moving the ball so slick and his body movement just really want that last third i'm sure he's going to do more damage as the game goes on harry the guire preparing to take a free kick for england the yard or so inside his own half and he's gone backwards back for rice who just dropped deep and split the two england's set to halves for a month stone's back for rice again it's just an exercise and keeping possession now towards the end of this first half for england with a couple of minutes of stoppage time to play england leading mom nil here on talk sport jim prouford solc Campbell and stew appears the former england world cup defenders talking you through the action here in northern rome tonight faker others are england corresponded mark sagas in the chair we'll hear from in a moment at halftime as sterling brings it forward good dynamic run down the right hand side of the penalty area have england won a corner yes they have which is their first but he's just a referee flag for a corner the referee pointed to the edge of the six yard box just a referee just so he just moved his flag round 90 degrees to indicate it was a gold kick i thought it was a corner really but that's what you want sterling running at you that's it they've switched sides sentio and sterling so you know that i like that you know let's see what happens on the other side england still haven't had a corner as yet the guaya heading the ball forward from the gold kick sanjo now on the left flank comes into a more central position links up with sterling sterling back for walker walker to stones maguire to his left base ball in advance of him to deathland rice who could travel with it over the halfway line and go into the feet of luke shore again still england won that up as they've been for the first majority of the game back he goes for harry maguire maguire to stones is the england fans that you can hear and for all the pre-match predictions of how many england fans will actually be here at the stadio olympico it's probably five times as many maguire has just been brought down now there's another chance for england to kill the game or kill the half maguire is just down garem chuck was leaning over him and yama lenko came in and frog marched his teammate away i don't know whether he felt that yarem chuck was being a little bit busy and getting involved with maguire or perhaps he felt that he shouldn't be helping him back up to his feet making sure he was all right either way the referee just wants a little word with yama lenko things are being calmed down now and lukshaw and yama lenko just having a word looks as though the red mist has descended for a moment stewart on your right-winger at west ham and they're calming him down and it's going to be a freaking restart play for england which harry maguire has taken back behind square again with the three minutes of the stoppage time now having elapsed ball put out of play that's the end of the half and it's been a typical england half within euro 2020 in many ways england plenty of possession lots of containment the old scare at one end but the breakthrough at the other they're 45 minutes away from a home semi-final against denmark yagrein nil england won at the break england have actually in euro history have scored a goal to take the lead five times in the opening five minutes of matches have won any of them lost three and the two draws both ended in penalty shootout defeats well in 96 while in 2004 i only say that to make the point that nothing has been won yet but england of 45 minutes away from a semi-final against denmark here on the talk sport england white shirts dark blue shorts kicker from left to right in this second half against the ukraine team in or yellow harry kain has been fouled and this is a really good set piece opportunity right at the start of the second half and said or to just a little bit over zealous as he just tried to go over the top of harry kain's boot to get to the ball and the court his foot as well so ukraine line up a two-man wall they've got one two in the deep they've got another six on the edge of the penalty here england they've got three in the box make that five by the time ricen stones have but lately arrived again elixir so it's going to be a left-footed luke shore away swinger that's what's planned into heller and in on england and scored right at the beginning of both halves harry maguire this time attacking it lovely in swinging delivery maguire with a bullet header it's a throwback to the last world cup maguire from a set piece england got to the semis in that they go to the semis in this as well ukraine nil england two super super fantastic you know first free kick great delivery great contact bullet header fantastic what a help i think when you put the ball into an area like that it was uh really really tight on the offside situation i'm sure he's just on side it was matt vienco who's running him behind trying to play catch up with maguire but when maguire bears down on goal like that there's only one outcome and that is a fantastic start to this half once again for england scored a late winner against poland back in march he's scored in the world cup quarter final he's now scored in the euro's quarter finals and you can you can just dare to dream now two nil to england still more than 40 minutes to go but a perfect start of the first half a perfect start of the second as well ukraine nil england two kane and maguire yeah we've been bemoaning the set place in previous games either from corners all three kicks you get the delivery right and with the lights and maguire going in on a very very difficult to stop dekla rice has just put his foot through a loose ball in the midfield to make sure that he got it away from caravane and goes out of play for a throw which will be taken on the ukraine and right midway between the halfway line and the edge of the penalty area england lining up pinkford in goal walk is stones maguire and shore philips and rice sancho mountain sterling with harry kane up front and england winning it back tigress into the challenge in midfield think after everything that we've had the almost non-stop football for some players over the course of the last 13 months or so has been a little bit of lethargy from the players in every team throughout this tournament perhaps towards the end of the first half there were a few illustrations of that but england buoyed now by that goal ukraine ping the ball back to the goalkeeper who shundered well to get it back out for mikolenko ball over the top is taken an awkward bounce your amtrak trying to get on the end of it quarterfinal that we saw earlier today demarkin complete control in that at about this stage of the game leading the checks by two goals to nil but checks got one back and it all became a little bit fraught fractious and frenetic i think we'll have to make sure that they don't allow that to happen here leading by a couple of goals to nil mikolenko back for sidorchip sidorchip bringing over the half wayline it's only about 15 yards inside england territory and fowl in philips wasn't going to let him get any further he forces him to go back for at the enko now comes down towards mikolenko again a level with us about 10 yards inside the half of england defending in this second half i'll play by sidorchip back for mikolenko again mikolenko to map the enko we'll take it towards the edge of the center circle and just wait for harry kane to try and rob him of possession and then he won it back but as they played it forward towards sidorchip jayden sancho stuck out of left foot and he won it now england might be able to break quickly and they have a chance to make some man making good ground towards the edge of the penalty area it's found raheem sterling and also left hand side chips in by shawl there is goal number three harry kane again what a start of the second half two in the opening five minutes there's no way back for ukraine now and england can dream of another 75er in the major tournament and their first in the euros since 1996 it's going to happen it's your krain nil england three top gamble fantastic by mal driving driving driving and then sterling lovely back hill and a great chip and there again harry doesn't miss from there what a start fantastic roll on great header from kane's shoot yeah it certainly was listen top quality delivery from the fallback and top quality header from kane fantastic it's really puts in charge of this time now and the calmest people in the stadium south gate and holland just chatting things through where do we go from here nice and comfortable see the game out but listen england have been absolutely sumptuous in this second half yeah it's gone well so far three goals in the space of 54 minutes for harry kane one the other night and two in the first 50 today here in row ukraine nil england three and then mark are waiting and surely surely england have got the job done there so i think the more this game goes on the gym the more the importance of your utilisation of substitutes if you get to a stage in a game where you know you're beyond the beyond the clock let's say uncomfortable within the game that's when you look after your players on a yellow card potentially nicole england playing the ball through the midfield or ced or churkin now it goes back for matthew enko again and ukraine looks shell shot after a brilliant start from england at the beginning of this second half perhaps struggled to defend balls played aerial inside the penalty area for avid tournament and they conceded twice two headers in the opening four five minutes of this second half ukraine nil england three the ball is playing back for mica lecce lico on the edge of the box it just runs away from your remture and there's another important touch from harry mcguire this one just arcing it 50 yards up into the nice sky and it will bounce down on halfway and out of play for a throw and we were talking about how england could win this game sold before its starting you were talking about deliveries into the kill zone and we've seen it and that's it that's what you've got to do give whoever's in there a chance to kind of put the ball away either by you know good cross or bullet header so they've done really well i think england has been fantastic keep holding the ball give it under the ball and when it's the right moment great cross feed it in beautiful i think good good teams now jim take a pride in keeping a clean sheet you know top teams in world football we should be one of those we should be sort of looking for that now and saying you know what whatever happens we don't concede a goal now if we go and get four and five so be it but we don't concede a goal what's the psychological advantage if england could go into a semi-final having not conceded a single goal in the tournament up to that point and what an edge that could give them they have possession now inside their own half they've got the healthiest of leads three nil there's a rare mistake as the ball is played out towards left hand such like around him standing actually went behind him and england are going to make a double change very shortly see the jude bellingham is going to come on and jorton henderson as well so england are now in a position uh position excuse me with this three goal lead that they can think about the disciplinary situation that they can get rice and philips off the field because i'm sure to be those two that are withdrawn and they know that they're not going to pick up this yellow card for a slightly mistime challenge on a on a hot night the suspension won't come to fruition deklin rice has it now lady back for luke shore and sure will play for it again inside the center circle nice little pop off around the corner harry kane who's scored three international hat tricks in his career eyeing up a fourth all the way back for walker kane incidentally only two goals and 12 games going into the germany match now three in his last two sure back through the midfield again for rame sterling sterling just going into a more central position and still a bundle of energies the lovely turn just trying to get the better of chap aren't going to eventually was able to stick his foot into knocking away england have got the substitutes ready well i can't see two belligom for a moment he's he's put his shirt on i think he's just back down in the dugout but jorton henderson will be coming on for the next break in play and just exchanging a few thoughts with the spanish fourth official carlis delcera grande at the moment right in front of us zhchenko's got possession for ukraine and he plays it back for matthiy enko england three mil up in a major quarter final yeah seriously ball played by sabani out of caravayak caravayak look at the yama lenko the yama lenko looking for inspiration they look a little bit the league at now ukraine and england have done well to spin the ball out towards the left hand touch line where sterling was peeling away but ukraine have got it back they've had the majority of possession in the second half but england have twice hit them with rapier blows two superb headers and england lead by three goals and they're building on that early harry kane goal now there's a free kick has been given ukraine's way for a foul on yama lenko and england will make the first change it doesn't look as though it is going to be a double at the moment but it is going to be henderson for rice stewart england's first challenge yeah as i say going into the game i mean we spoke i spoke with joe tay in the week on one of the programs and you know he was of a an opinion that england can turn over ukraine comfortably uh brave and resting one or two of our players on yellows and that was an opinion i was was not the same opinion but i think it's a sensible situation now to maybe look after one or two um and i think henderson getting more minutes hungry is built as well rice he'll be pleased with his evening's work it's all about managing now you know utilizing that that bench and getting guys playing and um i'm sure there's going to be a few more changes before the end of the night so jordan's jordan henderson coming on he came on a half time and again against the checks and played the last five minutes against germany has only started two of the last 19 internationals but still an integral member of this england squad our possession with kag rolling studs over the top of the ball dropping into a deep position when he looked up he had three ahead of him sancho on the right hand side jordan emerson had made a third man run past him as well but england just taking a more conservative option upfield comfortable leads in the knockout games in major tournaments few and far between her remember one that you played in song against denmark back in the 2002 world cup i think england three three three and up inside half an hour of that raining pouring the rain but it's uh it's hot out there football is hot it's fantastic england just controlling the game that's what i like to see the passing with movement and they're going to wait for the right opportunity to kind of bounce again so it's great everybody's buzzing now um it's pleasing to see henderson bank for pickford pickford's record currently 664 minutes without conceding a goal since dris merton's put one pass in for belgium gordon banks with the all-time england record at 721 minutes just a shade over 12 hours england able to bring the ball forward again looking for goal number four slipped in the direction of kane but it was well read by the center half sabani came across and was able to lock it away england pick up the second ball in and around the edge of the penalty area for more than happy just to work it back to halfway emerson for stones maguire back for jorton henderson again emerson has six yards inside his own half works it forward into the uh feed of harry kane just looking as though there's a weight lifted off his shoulders with the game that he scored against germany the other night more of a christmas about his work and he's smiling his face all put out a play for a throw that kane's industry has uh helped garner that's a throw that'll be taken on the england right right down by the corner flag ukraine nil england three on torx sport with 14 minutes gone in the second half all right torx sport with jim pram but sol cambal and stew appears to former england world cup defenders and captains kane back for walker emerson down the line for sancho sancho trying to get towards the fire line couldn't beat mikolenko who turns it away goes out of place due for another england throw play the power it's sirena yes uh garith and steve e ollen deep in conversation now when it's fair to say the uh the topic of conversation will be the utilisation of the bench you know outlined it before of how important that actually was and will be in tournament football and sometimes it is just that in match situations like this where you're saving some players you're saving legs and also as well you're rewarding some of those that are on the bench and saying to them giving them valuable minutes within a game but it's very rare that in competitions like this that you can be so comfortable in a game that all changes with a goal we understand that but at this moment in time we can dictate the tempo with this game and the ukrainians look because they've had their hearts broken henerson will find harry maguire maguire springs it onto his right foot slips down the inside left channel luke shore had made a run from out to in and receives it and he goes back for philips back for maguire again remembering terms of the substitution situation england can make five but they can only make them at three different junctures within this second half they've made the one bringing henerson on so you would imagine it's going to be a couple of doubles from here when gath south gate and steve e ollen think that the time is right i'm sure that calvin philips are belling him for philips is a change that uh probably is in the post already philips has possession now 61 gone three little england two for kane in the only five minutes of each half and harry maguire a minute into this second period calvin philips with a long diagonal out towards the england right which is headed away by michael enko and out for a throw that mason mount will come across the tape and the conjunction with the car walker in ukraine now that they're going home after this now and they look dispirited henerson back for philips philips back for harry maguire maguire inside the center circle working it out towards the england left hand side for raheem sterling sterling and kane both tide and the top of the england goal scoring charts with three now henerson dropping deeper chipping one over the top trying to get sterling in left but he finally all good save well that would have been some way to marthe hattrick harry kane he hit it so sweetly left footed on the edge of the penalty area buschand threw himself to his left and was able to beat it round the post but that would have been a magnificent hattrick his ability to adjust his body shape and get a shot away as clean as that is absolutely incredible left foot as it landed goalkeeper's done really well always just looking at the replay and it was literally fingertips that kept it out the goal is a wonderful side the nine kane is 39th goal of the season mcguffin country but as the corner comes in it is put in for four and jordan handerson breaks finally breaks his england duck he couldn't do it from the penalty spot in the friendly but he can do it from a corner in a major quarterfinal he breaks his duck he breaks ukrainian hearts it is ukraine nil england four and into the last four so fantastic that's what we want that's what we want fantastic you can't be you know for me everything's just you know fitting into place and you know chasing subs and you know the lads have worked really hard to get into this position and i'm so pleased with jordan handerson you know breaking his duck but you know this is incredible this is a fantastic night for him awful defending i've got to say great run so this it was about two or three players all lined up to at that end it was henderson who darted level with a near post who guided it down fantastic goal we've been bemoaning the level of quality from set plays we've been treated to three wonderful deliveries that have resulted in goals well sorry too that have resulted in goals and i think england has send him sending a message out now we're keen to italy's message the other day we're good enough and playing well enough to win this tournament well this does give england the opportunity to make changes now and it's going to be a triple change luke shore comes off kiran trippier is coming on to replace him jubelina and marcus rashford are ready as well which of the other england players that will make way rahaim sterling is the first sterling has had another outstanding night integral in everything that england have done sterling coming off and marcus rashford on to replace him and calvin phillips makes way as well jubelina being introduced so shore phillips and sterling off should be a belligham and rashford coming on to replace them still really sensible work from the bench i think they you know looking off the sterling it's been wonderful again tonight it really has he sparked it off creator of the first goal gone past people and he's an absolute credit to the england setup phillips wonderful almost becoming valuable to this squad phillips at the moment now on this team and it gives fellingham a chance as well to get on and have some good minutes and a feel good factor in england shirt and that almost forgotten man in some ways marcus rashford on the pitch as well but listen it's the perfect scenario at the moment yeah 25 minutes for those three recently arrived substitutes to make an impact first man off the bench he has already made an impact with his first international goal jordan hennesson breaking his duck at the 62nd time of asking in an england shirt he was the new fielder who played more games for england than anybody in history without scoring for his country but he's done it now and the massive grin that lit up the eternal city is an iconic moment that i'm sure that he will never forget that his family will never forget a servant he has been for england and that is a prize moment for him and this is the night that england will never forget you think back to the successes that england have had the failures that england have had in major tournaments they trip off the tongue but this is an i will talk about for a long time england scored from their first corner and marcus rashford's first contribution is to win their second which will be taken over on the left hand side and when they said why ukraine can't defend corners they can't defend high ball inside the penalty area they're susceptible to headers they weren't kidding england has scored three in this second half can they make it four four making runs on the edge of the penalty area swung it deep around the back although it's an england first contact harry maguire off balance could only head it wide we're midway through the second half on talk sport ukraine nil england four you know what it's all about maintaining the quality now you know ukraine are just you know they're done now they're just you know they're looking at the clock and they just want to wind the clock down now but england got to keep on doing all the right things keep on pressing keep on nicking on the ball and and be professional now it's all about being ultra professional now rashford in possession on the england left hand side just exchanging passes with trippier england remember if they can keep a clean sheet tonight we'll break a national record seventh successive clean sheet haven't conceded now for 10 hours and 40 minutes of play 640 minutes the only goal they've conceded in 2021 to jakup modder of poland and if they can keep a clean sheet tonight they will be the first side in the european championship history ever to keep clean sheets in the first five games of the finals fact there's only ever been one country who's done it at a major tournament one european country should have said that's italy in the 1990 world cup the only side to start a campaign with five clean sheets in iraq and englander just a shade over 20 minutes away from doing that they leave four now and ukraine have possession on halfway okay still putting a shift in not quite at full pace but still keeping the defenders honest and charging down trying to win possession back trying to stop ukraine playing out from the back there's a tie contribution on the left hand side right in front of us from the substitute shankoff who just controlled it and then the ball ran away from him as he tried to get a second touch it had already gone over the line and out of play for a throw that'll be taken on the england right hand side 68 garnish ukraine nil england four and it's going to be a very positive reaction from the england manager from the headline makers as well you can hear that reaction with our england correspondent fey carothers after the game here on talksmore with will you through until 11 out of capital and mickey grail will be taking your calls from 11 on i make seven one seven double two double three double four england trying to pull those their way through inside the penalty area again but the starting challenge was good enough to be able to get it away it was chaparenco that stuck his foot in now england having one score with rashford and the crane will be able to play out from the back a long ball over the top and england had kept everybody upfield jordan pickford comes out and does enough to start with his office line and the attempted lob from 35 yards didn't get off the ground and england are able to block it and get it away it's the warning shot off the cross the boughs though that england can't be complacent the clean sheet is important they've got to make sure that they keep their shape jordan pickford comes out and acknowledges his kicking error there's a positional error from the england backlight who had everybody at four nil up inside ukrainian territory that's all yeah that's the lack of concentration you know sometimes it happens but we've got to make sure we uh we're tight and where every movement don't drop it don't drop the concentration be professional to the end do all the boring stuff all the time just keep it keep it kind of simple and concentrate when you talked about jim the headline makers on gareth now when you look back and sort of decode some of the decisions that he's made along the way you know bringing henderson bringing maguire uh star in raheem sterling all of those are substitutions and team selections he must think well that you know he's having a housey and summer at the moment as much as the players not much of course you're only 90 minutes away from any summer losing housey and status but england about to go into the final week of the tournament and about to make their final change as well uh dominik cowbert louis is stripped and ready for action and it's yamal g johnny b and k that's going to come off but here's walker in possession for england on halfway working into the feet of jordan henderson as straight back again and now john stones finds maguire maguire on the edge of the center circle is able to venture forward which is working into the feet of jute belligan and england towing with ukraine this really is just an exercise in running the clock down and getting back to wembley on wednesday to take on the danes live on torxport build up from six stewart sol alongside park sagas we're willing for the commentary of that one on torxport an eight o'clock kickoff and tuesday the first of the semi finals as italy meets spain england trying to get around the back again on the left hand side of the penalty area good dynamic darting run came from mason mounts played back by rashford belligan laying you back for maguire donny carver louis still very patiently waiting his opportunity to come on but his opportunity to come on is only going to come after the ball has gone out there's no sign of that happening at the moment carver louis waits hands and arms behind his back very patiently now i'll get his chance because the referee has spotted an infringement i think it's going to be a free kick and carver louis for cain is the final change being made good night for harry cayne though stewart pierce goal early in each half to underpin this victory it certainly is delighted for him i really am i don't think his form was fantastic going into certainly this game but three goals in in 90 minutes basically two tonight and one very late on in the german game you can never write this fella off mentally very very strong clinical in front of goal and the important thing for england as i said before the tournament if england are going to win this tournament harry cayne's got to play well now there's a lot of football to play he's played well tonight hopefully he's got two more good games in him plus some goal scoring feats as well which will take us all the way six goals in the world cup three in these euros nine and fifteen games in major tournaments now for cain carver louis who got the final seconds against kroatia gets a little bit longer tonight he's got the last 20 percent of the game there are there about ukraine have possession hending in their own right back area at the moment and when the england fans sing it's coming home every chorus just has that little bit more conviction now england nothing up at the back of the walkers clearance hits in chenco stones can get it back for pickford better clearance throwing this time headed on through the midfield brought down at the back by big said a half map venko now just chapa renko to work it out towards the ukrainian right can england keep this record breaking clean sheet shot comes in from this pick for pizza away's are very little to do in terms of saves got that one away since enchanco then couldn't link up the player by miguel enko on the left hand side and the clearance switch walker tries to hit up field which hits me gelenko just loops up into the roman night sky and jordan pickford can make a comfortable save 16 to go it's ukraine nil england four on talk sports all camera now it's all about you know it's about when you play like this and you want to kind of you know obviously you want to run the clock down you don't want to make any mistakes you want to keep the ball moving making sure there's no silly mistakes because all those little bits and all those kind of you know sloppy passes and maybe sloppy kind of clearance it makes you kind of you have to run you have to cover now it's all about conserving energy conserving energy don't waste any more energy there are guys england with it inside the center circle wish stones that just feels as though england have had a lot of the ball in this kind of area throughout the game but they have been lethal in front of golf six attempts on target four of them have gone in three headers and an opportunity to try and find another one now is this right foot inside the penalty area is a good ball in from sancio it really might have wrapped his right foot around it down on the dead ball line and ukraine have cleared just away from the on rushing camera in goes out of play for a throw but it'll be taken on the england right hand side we're into the final 15 and the camera fans the harry kane sat on the bench successful nights work for him always want to be in a side that gets better as the tournament grows older this thing goes out of doing that is walker walker on the right hand touch line cabalouin trying to turn it around the corner but it's knocked away easily by the ukrainian backline the well time jump at the back by john stones can go that away just for a moment it's two against three but yama lenko's used his hand and it's a free kick got to be taken by england 10 yards inside their own half 15 minutes away from a semi-final it's a lovely phrase to attest you it certainly is you just get the impression tonight where there's a lot of euphoria around the german victory and for what that symbolized this victory tonight internally i'm talking amongst the squad will be very very wokeman like with a steely determination looking forward to that semi-final balls out of play for a goal kick just to reiterate the situation i know you're away it's italy against spain on tuesday and surely england against denmark on wednesday final sunday night maybe a little bit premature to clear the diaries yet but you're never enough no there'll definitely be a final sunday night my friend oh okay i'll clear your diary i'll clear the diary that's fine i do need to point out at this stage that england have played demark twice this season didn't score on either of them and lost to them at wembley it was the the day that england ended up with the two players being set off harry maguire for two bookable offenses inside the opening half hour or so and then rice james after the full-time whistle you can't take anything for granted in terms of getting to the final i think you can now take for granted that england will be reaching the settings for the first time since 1996 pick for with another poor clearance force for zinchenko plenty of traffic between him and gol and ukraine the force to go back towards halfway and then having got that far at the enko is supposed to go all the way back to his goalkeeper bushamp it's been seven times on his international debut earlier this season and beaten four in a major quarter final tonight so far yama lenko into yurempche yurempche back towards the edge of the center circle ukraine able to just work the passes mackerenko is in there now the play falling towards yurempchuk again yurempchuk who scored against the dutch and against the macedonians as well ten international goals for him this season after a good season playing club football in belgium forget and he'll make his way into the middle now as they will try and find him but only found john stones with a close getting left-footed cross that was easily repelled and he goes out of play for a throw on the ukrainian left-hand side 12 to go four nil to england here's salt gamble yeah um you know i just can't believe it it's fantastic you know when you look at this england four nil up all these changes and we're playing fantastic football that's what it's all it's it's unbelievable really you know next stop semi-final we just got to keep it going enjoy enjoy playing in there we've got to see you know try things run them move one twos get it going love it is there but concentrate don't let anyone score this ukrainian score keep a clean shoot it's in chenco towards the edge of the area yarmulinko trying to get it on to his left foot couldn't do so in the end he that's the next best thing buys a corner as the right foot across comes shot is flicked away it's the ukrainian's first corner of the second half taken by mancheson city's alexing cenco over on the ukrainian right and they've got plenty of bodies committed forward as you would imagine just trying to get a consolation goal six inside the penalty area ready to attack this left-footed ball swung in plenty of whip on a good header away by dominic carver louis and from whence it came out to that right flank something or nothing more from chaper nko as in cenco did well to field in england though win it back and try and turn it on the edge of their own penalty area into a more advantageous position rashford turn one way then turn the other and goes all the way back for pickford who slams it upfield and bounces on halfway tend to go four nil to england and then we play four through the midfield again by ukrain england just keeping a shake cenco that was matthiyenko matthiyenko with the left back nico lenko ahead of him and it's the ball that he plays right in front of valdryshevchenko who stands hands-on hips on the edge of the technical area just hasn't been ukrain's night they have only failed to score in one of their ten matches since the turn of the year but opportunities still had have been few and far between for them just two on target so far still england's shot count on target that they faced in the whole tournament is still in single figures there are 10 minutes left in this one it's ukraine nil england four it's steward pierce you know i'm just looking firstly the shot count absolutely fantastic that you know the stats speak for themselves there that is wonderful and a real recommendation for the whole team and their defensive work secondly as well just looking at on the left hand side there you know trippier coming on might be just more than resting luke sure that substitute putting trippier there right footed he's stronger on the inside with yama lenko out there coming inside so might be a good little matchup he had the opportunity of putting chillwell on but decided not to and that's probably because of trippier's confidence at play left back and also as well the fact that you know the strength is on his right foot which nullifies yama lenko strength fantastic darting run for by marcus rashford the substitute really going up through the gears as he tried to get on the ball that have been pinged over the top it was a little bit too heavy for him and it goes out of play for a goal kick that'll be taken by bush out plenty to react to i think it's fair to say a famous night in the stadium olympica alan casual and mickey grail will be taking your calls on talk sport tonight nox717 double two double three double four get him in have you say on talk sport from 11 tonight a weekend sports breakfast with natalie soyer alongside the public of island of former republic of island international tony cascarino tomorrow morning and don't forget we also bring you a podcast to kickstart your day from talk sport as we nail the biggest talking points from euro 2020 all the big interviews as well and you can download all listen to the euro daily podcast on the talk sport at or wherever you get your podcasts it's four nil to england with eight minutes to go demmark await on wednesday jayden sancho's got possession he's had worse weeks and he'll get inside the penalty area now and he's scepto his way through but he was judged to have found nicole nko have that decision come at nil nil i think he would have been met with fury but when you've fallen it up with eight minutes to go you let it pass and i think there was an awful lot in it probably just maybe a hand on the top of the shoulder nicole nko felt the contact went down so free give you a crane the play out from the back solar got some good news for you what's that you've lost your record what records that don't pretend to have Jordan Henderson scoring his first senior goal for england his 60 second cap is the longest ever wait by a player before scoring their first goal for the three lines beating and certain mr solzia cambell who was a previous record holder scoring in your 47th appearance records are there to be broken he's your mchuck inside the penalty area and you're glad that one has been ball played forward plenty of people in the world have never scored a goal for their country so here's sir jordan Henderson playing through the midfield and he's found belligom belligom to henderson henderson sancho back for belligom belligom just days after his 18th birthday back to stone stones to mcguire and towards kira and trippie six and a half minutes to go here on talk sport ukraine they'll england for jordan Henderson has it again the ola he's coming from the england fans in the crowd just imagine if we're in different circumstances and the world was a different place if this place was full tonight and england had 30 000 in you really wouldn't be able to hear yourself as it is those that are here relishing the moment and their team have done them proud walk out back to stone stones his left hand side for harry mcguire again another record for england this is the longest england have ever gone at the start of a major tournament without concealing a goal in the 1966 world cup they conceded in the 82nd minute of game five the usabio penalty and now in the 85th minute of this one 445 minutes into the tournament and england's defense still yet to be breached ukraine just watching england passing the ball between themselves at the back but now they have it back up just slightly misplaced a ball out towards the england right your enter now for shaperenko played towards the zinchenko zinchenko down to the ukrainian left good movement off the ball comes from mikkelenko mikkelenko will cut inside and will be down to the left hand side of the penalty area the danger hasn't passed for england yet it will now as a audacious backheal flick inside his own penalty area from jordan Henderson together the way little over from marcus rashford trippie couldn't hook his left foot around it and tried to play the ball over the top for rashford's run so england's slow it down and the oles come out again at the back so i don't think he would have done that to neil nilda might not have played in the next game had he done it at neil nilda but now it's just you know oles are going on the leds have had a fantastic night great great night for our nation england perfect neil nil i mean you know no goals julian just keep it going kaveluin drops all the way back to halfway just you got a touch really lays it back from maguire and maguire can turn and ukraine will pay lip service for putting a little bit of pressure on from the front but they knew really in the opening seconds of the second half when one nil became two nil but they were behind the eight ball when two very soon became three and it was all over for them three has subsequently become four two for k one for maguire one for henderson and england strolling literally strolling at the moment to victory and to a place in the semi finals ukraine had possession but they're 15 yards aside their own half and it's played by shaperenko and towards the right hand touch line and straight back to him again shaperenko does a barney and the sliding challenge comes in from sterling they've played all the way back to keorgi buschan the goalkeeper will have better nights than this in terms of his international career he did produce one stellar save to deny harry kena hatred not an awful lot he could have done about the four that beat him ukraine still just outside the top 20 in the fifa world rankings notwithstanding this performance it's been a decent rise under chef chenco they are a country that are moving in the right direction and this better to come from them you think particularly with the likes of the the 18 year old sabanius said a half who's got a great future man the enco's got it now and it's going to be a triple change made by ukraine just to give some minutes to some of the players don't pick the hero the other night against sweden's going to be coming on and tim chiccan sudikov will get the nod as well two and a half minutes to go and ukraine with the ball down the left hand side for nicole enko it's just about keeping a clean sheet now for england that's all that matters the job is done ball played for cavitt louis can't get there it was lunched away from him before it reached him by macarenco and then england at the back maguire just steps over and lets it run through for jorgen pick for two to go plus stopping some there won't be too much of it sol and it's four nil to england on a great great night it's a great night in rome fantastic job done now it's a fantastic to feel you know be here and see this quality from the indian side it's great well those three ukranians are ready waiting to come on they might not get the opportunity pickford gets it upfield sancho chasing after nicole enko is there there's no eagerness from england who have declared i think it's fair to say to get a fifth goal there's no need for it but you just wonder whether one last opportunity might present itself the good for marcus rashford i think if he could get on the score sheet a player that is uh get to score a goal for england in a major tournament you've seen what a lift to gate harry cane scoring against germany the other night he's built on that tonight that'd be good if a chance could come rashford's way the crane had possession we're in the 90th minute and the ball is played out to the right hand side there have been very few games in this tournament where one side has been so completely and utterly dominant above the opposition and that has been as well as england's progress of course from a selfish point of view what has made it such a brilliant spectacle but this has been a shooing zabani through the midfield makarenko shaper and now that's towards the right hand touch like a catavaya or this is a footballs coming home still emanating around the stadio olympico here dropping deeper in the midfield makarenko will be able to pick it up 15 seconds of the 90 minutes to go and still those three ukrainian substitutes wait patiently might only be a couple of minutes to be added on balls on the left hand side of the penalty area worked in towards in cienko took a tumble of no appeals from him that there should be a penalty he just fell over inside the penalty area and as he comes right down the loose ball in front of those three ukrainian substitutes it was kept in by one of their number and the full-time whistle blows no need for stoppage time no need for an interest tonight a famous night a perfect night one of those that you will just never forget england into the final week keep dreaming keep believing do so with a little bit more intent and believe the italian job has been successfully navigated it is now two home wins a glory england doing their damage in the air early in both halves and like kane and like maguire and like henderson england are heading in the right direction it's denmark on wednesday in the semis ukraine nil england four",
