  "transcript": " ...and Rice and Bellingham, Sacher on the right, Thorne on the left, and Harry Kane up front. So whatever temptation there was for Garis Southgate to change his team, just the one change. And Slovakia unchanged, Dubravka with Newcastle and Goal, Peckery, Vavros, Skriniy, the captain and Hansko, Kutka, Lobotka and Duda, Strants, Haraslín in the wide positions, as Harry Kane actually has the ball cleared into him, and it bounces straight through to Dubravka on the bounce, no worries for Slovakia, but that'll count as England's first decent on target. That would have been the most random goal you'll ever see if that would have gone in. I mean, the ricochet, they do a different start, aren't they, Slovakia? They play it back, one of the centre backs sets the other one to go long, and Harry Kane just sprinted straight forward, jumped, that almost rugby style really, wasn't it? Just blocking a kick and ricocheted off him straight into the goalkeeper's hands. And the other member of the Slovakia team that was running through there, it is significant, Davide Strelitz has been chosen up front rather than Boschiennik, who started the first two matches, that was the big talking point for Slovakia. So, Strelitz it is, and we are off and under way, England and Slovakia in the round of 16, here at the Euros, this is for the right to play Switzerland in the quarterfinals in Dusseldorf on Saturday. England in the all-white kit again, or at least with the blue trim up the side, and England, everyone looking to see what sort of performance this will be, whether they will be able to move the ball more quickly, it's back in front of the penalty area with Stones and Gay, and Gay now just taps the ball back to Jordan Pickford on the edge of the six yard box, who works it out to John Stones, who will give it back to Pickford again, and already this is the very very patient approach, as Pickford on his left foot chips it out here to the right side, as England play from left to right in this first period, Walker goes back to Stones who just draws the challenge from Strelitz, and then Pickford actually is going to carry the ball out of the penalty area on his own, and hits that long left footed pass that is flicked in field by the head of Bellingham, comes back to Bellingham, no it's just taken away from an in-center field by LeBott, Bellingham the day after his 21st birthday, and then the first Slovakia attack down the right front, plates down and it's a throw into him. Lovely car play from LeBott, there, that holding midfield pivot for Slovakia, brought the ball down, cool as you like, he really does look the part actually in the heart of the Slovakia midfield. Yep, the number 22, the Napoli man who plays for the coach, Francesco Calzona, for both country and club, Calzona, who had two jobs for the latter part of the season, coach of Napoli, long crossfield pass from Walker, the crowd like that, Trippier infield to Foulden, he gets his first touch of the match, back to Trippier again, now he has Declan Rice infield, Manu with his first touch, confident, first time, Crisp turned it back into his own half, England now on the left hand side, Slovakia in the all blue, that pass was a little short, all game with the challenge, that's going to be a yellow card, and that's a problem, that is a problem for England, because Gay is one of the England men on a yellow card, and if England go through, Mark Gay will be suspended for the quarterfinal. Well, it's funny, we were just talking with Joe beforehand about the yellow cards, when the screen came up with the teams, it's a real shame because he's been so key, but he's sold short by Kieran Trippier's pass back to him, he's on the touchline Trippier, and he just doesn't fire the ball into him with enough intensity, he's too slow, he's rolling towards him, and puts him banging trouble really, John, he picks up that yellow card early in this game as well, God be careful. That's very much the other side of it, and Trippier with the pass that was short, so it's a free kick to Slovakia, out towards the right hand side, so that is a big early setback for England on a number of levels, and clearly there will be a discussion over who it is, who comes in if England progress. Here's the free kick into the penalty area, which is deflected wide, there were two men going for it, and I think it came off the knee of Stravitz, and went wide, great delivery. That is a big chance, big, big chance, I think they get in each other's way. They do. The players, I mean, if he just manages to get his head on that, it's a fantastic delivery, perfect angle of pace, just dropped into the right area, real warning shot. It's actually Stravitz who got in just in front of Kutska, and that deflected wide of the goal. England nil, Slovakia nil, there's the first warning. And they are dangerous, remember, even though this Slovakia team is ranked 45th in the world, they've already beaten Belgium at this tournament, Slovakia one of the third-place qualifiers, Walker's out of position. Now here's the dangerous Haras Linn on the left, Haras Linn into the penalty area, gives it to his left, and the ball right across the face of goal, driven there by Hanskjord, the left back, picked for diving down to his left, but we had the perfect angle, we knew it was going wide of the far post. It's been a sloppy start, I have to say. England not really at the races, not moving the ball quickly, Walker loses out the tackle, and the Slovakian team, I mean, it's a brilliant counter-attack in terms of the break, they get bodies forward, and he just cannot find the right pass there, Hanskjord, the left back. He's so advanced, he's put too much angle on it, it's not a shot, it's not a cross, it's kind of in between, he's better off choosing one or the other there, but another real warning shot. Here on Five Live for the commentary, we've got Matt Upsson, played at the World Cup for England, we've got Joe Hart, 75 caps, we've got Izzy Christiansen down behind the goal as well. Let's bring in Joe, that's an uncertain start from England, Joe. Yeah, I liked the first two minutes, I did, and then I thought Slovakia looked very comfortable, press, shape, look at this, their shape's low, isn't it? Yeah, but the shape's exceptional, they're ready, they're really ready to pounce, and that first, you know, mind and mistake that Kieran Tripier made, obviously, Gimmart Gahey picking up the yellow card, which is difficult in the third minute, here's Saka. Yeah, that's great from Saka, round his man to Baligham, Baligham in the penalty area, in comes the tackle, Menu's there on the edge of the box, gives it back to Saka, Saka, left footed, uses Menu, Menu back to Saka, Saka could be in, in comes the challenge, they miss the clearance, and then eventually scrap it away, and actually the referee, who is the Turkish referee, Ulut Meler, has shown a yellow card to Pukaj O Saka, as he was trying to get to the ball, he was late in on the challenge, and caught his man, and it's a free kick, and I mean, Harry Kane has gone to the referee, shaking his head, and Menu, it is, who put in the challenge, and it is Menu who is booked. Yeah, it's an interesting yellow card, really, because he's making a attempt to the ball, and he just stands on the foot of the ball, I mean, I think that's harsh for a yellow card, to be honest, I mean, he's not going in with any real force, and he doesn't really snap down on it, but it was stringy, I think with the block, wasn't it, Saka almost in on goal, and the big centre-back just gets a vital block in for Slovakia. That happened at the end, where Izzy Christensen is behind the goal, Izzy. Yeah, that's what Pukaj O Saka is all about, isn't it? What we've been missing, maybe, in the first couple of games, is him coming to the byline, and chopping in, and getting a cross in. Really good start from Pukaj O Saka. It's a great touch as well from Saka, from the long task, that took him away from handscored, the highly rated left back, as Slovakia come forward with Skrinjar, now into the central area, to the number 17, Haras Linn, square from him to Kutska. Kutska lifts a right-footed ball, Strelets back to the edge of the penalty area, Haras Linn with a shot, that hits stones, comes out again, Kutska with the ball right across the six-yard area, and all the way through for a goal kick. Um... Lively start. Very lively start, and a really strong start from Slovakia. Three chances now they've created, lovely passing play, get it into the front, it gets set back stones with the block, but the amount of time and space the midfield players have got to get the ball and pick their pass, nearly another really good ball from Kutska into that area, but the quality's been good from Slovakia. Slovakia, let me remind you, 37 attempts on goal during the three matches in the group stages, and they've shown here, well, they've carried on that form, haven't they? Here, positive start from Francesco Calzona's team, and an uncomfortable start for England with bookings for Gae and Manu. Here is Manu, and we're still only in the eighth minute, two England men boot, Walker, who's back to stones on the edge of the box. England flags draped all around this blue stadium of Shalka, forward towards Bukayo Saka, that first touch of the match will make him feel good, I'm sure, Saka to Walker, and then England go back into their own half. Walker points to down the line, Bellingham is there, out on the right-hand side, Saka as well, Bellingham's ball, all the way across, and then Trippier on his right foot arriving, absolutely skies the effort, arriving on it on his right foot, just inside the penalty area, halfway up the stand. Lovely ball from Bellingham, sees the space out wide, it really opens up, and Trippier, he just doesn't get his upper body over the ball. It's quite a tough one, it's a funny technique, the way he strikes it actually, doesn't really connect with the ball cleanly, it's perfect weight for him really to strike first time, but he's always leaning back. As Slavakia take a short goal kick and clear it away towards the halfway line, Bellingham, that was an excellent pass from Jude Bellingham, to spot the opportunity and the space that there was there for Kieran Trippier, who couldn't take advantage. So Slavakia break back towards the halfway line, that's given away to Pocayo Saka, Saka now back to Manu, Manu, who shuffles it forward, Declan Rice to his left, here's Jude Bellingham, who's made a positive start, I must say, after all of the talk about the way that he's played at the tournament, Thoden out there together as well, Bellingham too, back it goes towards the halfway line, still nail-nail, where it could easily have had an opening goal, Saka now just holds off the challenge, gives it back to Manu, Manu trying to find a way to... He does, Bellingham, now to Kain, Kain on the edge of the box, ball caught up underneath his feet, however he's been able to find Walker on the right-hand side, Walker with a cross, it's a deep one, should be headed away on the edge of the box actually, it's only headed out to Tripier, now back to Foden on the left-hand side, pass a little short to Tripier, he uses Rice, Rice 30 yards out, square to Manu, who's already looked a good choice, I must say, Kobi Manu despite the yellow card, Walker down the line to the byline, Saka catches up with that, Pocayo Saka in the white boots back to Walker, puts his foot on the ball, then infield out Manu, then Rice lifts it forward, but got badly underneath that and it just looked the way through for a goal, kicked us the back here, nail-nail, that passage of play for me is miles better, moving the ball, there's movement off the ball, which is the key, allows the passing to happen, but Manu does brilliantly a moment ago, just to toe the ball through into Kain, he couldn't quite get hold of it quick enough, and he had to shift it wide, it was a bit bubbly the pass to Karl Walker, but much better from England. Back down to behind the goal, is he? You can really feel the England fans behind as they were fizzing the ball around on that, that passage of play around the 18-yard box, they were crisp, they were sharp, exactly what I think everybody's wanted. Oh, that's a good ball to Haraslín down the left for Slovakia, Walker trying to get there, Haraslín, deflection cleared away, and somehow England survived, somehow, although it's won back, won back again by Duda, and that is giving us a free kick for the challenge on the Slovakia, number eight. Another massive let-off, brilliant play from Slovakia, what a pass, super pass, inside the fallback to Haraslín, gets the wrong side of Karl Walker, which you don't see that very often, just gets Karl Walker a little bit infield, not quite aware of where the player is, and it's a super block from Mark Eyre, he makes it all the way across from the left side centre-back, throws himself in front of the ball, it wasn't the most convincing of finishes from Haraslín, has to do better from that position, John, really. True, chaotic start from England, and actually, as Walker tried to recover and put in the challenge right on the edge of the area, I thought that could be a good chance. Could have given a penalty easily, and then there's a red card option as well. And a red card, England have survived that scare, England nil, Slovakia nil, Haraslín is going to take this, curls it in, that's powerfully headed away, by John Stones, comes out, England looking to bring it forward, look, that looked like a free kick it is, for the challenge on Kiran Trippier, as he was trying to take it away, and a yellow card now for Kutska. I think we can safely say that the referee doesn't mind a yellow, John. He's brandishing them out quite quickly in this game, I have to say. Which, in what's been quite a chaotic game, you know what that could mean? There's going to be a few, because obviously, Trippier's on a yellow card, isn't he? So all of a sudden, you could have to replace two of the back four, if Trippier picks up a booking in this game. Let's get a word from Chil Hart, Chil. Yeah, my jaw was slightly open there, seeing Carl Wolkham to chase one back, very unusual for him, but I thought it was some good recovery runs for Thordon, now John Finlay will take it over for him. For Thordon, down the left-hand side, Thordon's able to swing over the cross towards Sackett, but that's dealt with by Hans-Growe, who turns and puts it out of play, excellent pass from Trippier over the top, down the line for Thordon. It does feel, I have to say, that there are goals in this. Yes, 100%, which is good. The game has a different feel to it, John, and it isn't kind of slow-paced and dull, it's actually a really lively start to the game, maybe not for all the right reasons, but as a spectator, it's been enjoyable so far. And the other point to make, I don't think we've said, actually, it is quite cool here today. The heat has disappeared after all of the rain over the course, the weekend in the Ruhr Valley, stones, playing it across to Gay, now to the left-hand side to Trippier, and then infield towards Thordon, who's leaned into by Kutska, who's just picked up that yellow card, and I think he might have stepped on the ankle of Phil Thordon, a father again this week. Right, it's not foul. It's just strong, right? It's just strong. It's just a good tackle, Joe. Strong player that for me, I think the referee's getting way too involved. Yeah. Freak, they're taking an England, move it to the right-hand side, still 0-0 if you just joined us, five live in the World Service from the BBC, stones, halfway inside his own half. England have conceded so far just the one goal in the tournament, that excellent shot from Huleman against Denmark, but could easily have conceded here, could have conceded a couple of goals. Trippier, Trippier out there on the left, Gay, then picks out Kobe Nenu, who's been very involved, I must say, in the early stages, with 14, 15 minutes now on the clock. John Stone's winning his 76th cap tonight, across to Walker, his 87th. And then Walker and Stone's exchange passes again, the Manchester City pair, Declan Rice, then gets involved in England, are forced all the way back towards the edge of their own penalty area, and actually all the way back to goalkeeper Pickford. So they start again from in front of their own box, Trippier, Foden comes short, first-time pass from Foden. They've talked so much over the course of the last 24 hours about the fun that they've had this week, long pass from Stone's, I don't think Saka's got a chance of reaching that, he hasn't set a play for a throwing in their own left-back position, but they're opening few minutes, and some of the mistakes have been far from funny. Yeah, no, they haven't been funny. And also, Foden is being very central, he's not holding that width on the left-hand side at all. Haraslin or Bellingham in with a challenge, and that's a yellow card. I think Bellingham got the ball, but he's certainly got Haraslin as well, and now Jude Bellingham's booked, and that's three England players in the referee's book. Well, I'm not too sure if it is a yellow card, I mean, great to see the replay. My initial feeling was he wins the ball, and he's remonstrating with the referee, is really saying, I won the ball, which I think he did clip the ball, but then he took a big chunk of Haraslin, I think he gets a toe on the ball, which for me is a clean tackle. I think it's a clean tackle, I agree with you, but with the way we've just seen how this game's being refereed here, and I immediately thought he's going to book him. So as much as it isn't a booking, in this game it is, and this is the game that we're playing, so I think we need to be really aware of that, and that message needs to be getting onto the pitch. It doesn't matter what you think, this referee's in charge, and if he wants to make a decision, he will. England, nil, Slovakia, nil, far from plain sailing against Slovakia, who've never reached a quarter-final, but have made a strong positive start in the match here, Saka, but Saka loses out centrally, and now it is Lobotka of Napoli, who just recycles it from in front of the centre-circle. He's a player. Good player, really good player. He is a player. It's brilliant at winning the ball back, but the speed in which he distributes, he's got the picture of where he's going before he has it, and he just pops it around, really low centre of gravity, looking like a top player. Napoli man, Slovakia's most expensive footballer. He's caught the eye. He's certainly a contender for one of the players of the tournament in that position. England, nil, Slovakia, nil. Now here is the captain, Skriniar of Paris Saint-Germain, but Walker's able to get the right side of Hans Gull. I mean, they get high up the picture. That's the left back job. He's looking to get in behind Karl Walker on this side a lot of the time, and also Harris-Lynne will then come a bit narrower or deeper. They've got a nice build-up happening on the left-hand side for Slovakia. Yeah, Hans Gull, that's the left back who's been playing for Arnie Slott at Feyenoord this season, and there is a bit of talk that he may end up at Liverpool with him. We'll see about that. But England, 15 yards inside their own half. Stones onto his right foot, then back to Walker again, Bellingham make himself available, but instead the passes go to Saka on the right-hand side. Bukajosaka has looked a potential danger man for England in this match. Back to Maynou, and Declan Rice just holds off the challenge from him, and England go back to stationary ball again. Walker, then long pass from him. Trippier pushing up the left-hand side, puts in the challenge on Peckeryk. The oldest man in the squad, the 37-year-old Peckeryk, thrown taken by Trippier back to Rice. He has Maynou, Maynou then just keeps the ball, rolls it out here to Saka, Saka running up against Hans Gull. Still Saka in possession of the ball, goes in field, on his left foot again, cutting in field, square from him to his Arsenal teammate, Rice. Now back to Foden on the edge of the penalty area, over towards the left-hand side. Trippier back to Rice, and Maynou wants it. No, instead the ball into the area onto the head of Skriniar, who's able to head it away. That was a proper get-out header, wasn't it? I mean, he puts so much neck power into that clearance, Skriniar. He's no nonsense centre-back. Stones has given it away to Stralatz now. This is dangerous. Slavakir on the attack. All Rice goes in with a challenge there that he had to make. He had to time that well, particularly with the yellow cards we've seen, but he timed it perfectly. Cracking tackle from Declan Rice. He saw the opportunity. It was forceful, and he took a massive chunk of Kutskup at the same time. It's actually the perfect opportunity to win the ball and lead a bit on someone's own. Yeah, put down a marker. Yeah, yeah. And obviously with the way the game's been going, it was risky, but he nailed it. He absolutely nailed it. Let's hope that's going to get us a little foothold in the game again. Still nail-nail, but not a comfortable watch for England supporters. Wherever they are, either here in Gelsenkirchen in the stands, where there are massed ranks of white and red shirts, whether at home in the UK or around the world, listening to us on the World Service. Fortunate that it is still nail-nail. Menu. Now to Tripier. Phil Folder just comes back into his own half, then back to Tripier again. Mark Gay. We will have that conversation about who might come in if we get a chance match. So, what are you thinking, Capon? Stones back to Gay. And I think there's a lot of water to pass under the bridge before we start talking about an England quarterfinal, the way that this match has started over the first now, 20 minutes. I mean, it could go anywhere this game, Joe. It has that feel to it. It's entertaining to watch, but not entertaining, if you know what I mean. And then Saka loses out. Hanskull puts in the challenge, so Slovakia off. Another attack, there's a ball in field from Walker. That could have gone anywhere. That could have set Strelitz away. And John Stones was very fortunate that the ball deflected off him. But now England attack with Tripier on the left-hand side. Just the feel of this game. There must be a goal coming sooner or later. At that moment there, John, we've got an overload on the left-hand side. But Tripier comes straight inside. Not once have we got at the oldest player on the pitch. Pecker at the right-backs, 37, plays in the second division in Germany, doesn't he? And no one's isolated him, 1v1. No one's got at him on our left-hand side, their right-hand side at all. It's really surprised me in the opening 20 minutes. Yeah, place for Hertha in the capital in Berlin, England back on the halfway line. And then Tripier, he has one for Foulden to chase down the right-hand side. And actually, Fabro, the centre of the fender, comes across and takes the ball away from Foulden. As clean as a whistle, the Slovakia fans, the Falkens, will have enjoyed that. Now Rice wins it back. He has Ballingham on the edge of the area. Ballingham trying to find the position, left side of the box, back to Foulden. Foulden goes down, big shout for Penalty. I'm not sure. Ballingham, though, his cross, that's blocked by the defender. Comes out to Tripier, right-footed ball in from him. Kane with a header wide, came off the defender, it's a corner. This game is really edgy. I mean, it's happening at both ends. Declan Rice, brilliant interception, wraps the ball into Drew Ballingham. He gets past Scrinia, who has a real lunge for the talent, and then he just tickles the ball back into the penalty spot. And it's a wild clearance by Slovakia. It's a little bit messy from then. I mean, the tackle goes in on Foulden. It's a real melee. There's a lot going on inside that box. Came off the defender, Kane's header into the top of his shoulder. So corner from the right-hand side. The first quarter of the match is through, and somehow, both sides still. Yet to break through. Tripier with the corner from the right, takes it back towards Saka. Left-footed ball in from Saka, came off the header. The defender hasn't cleared its stone, stretching for it. Comes out, Mino goes for the volley, but it wouldn't hit. Hit it beautifully, but it flew away over the top left corner by a yard or more. That's a perfect trajectory, wasn't it? I'm looking at his facial expression as he jogs away, and he's a tough chance. Ball falling out of the sky, but he's got the quality to hit the target now. I think he's disappointed, actually. He's got that ability to dip and swerve the ball. It was a lovely effort. Time that beautifully. You know, a couple of yards lower. That's an unstoppable shot. But, yeah, that was a good couple of minutes from in there. Bravka slightly caught in two mines as well with the corner. I wanted to see Tripier put it in, but I thought it was a good ball in from Saka as well. Ball played forward by Duda. Here is Haraslina again, the number 17 walker, threatened to step in there on the challenge, back to hands go, then down the line. Bakia goes to the halfway line to Lobotka, and then through the middle England, back in position. But Slavakia just popping the ball around England. As Lobotka draws, Bellingham plays it in field towards Duda, and they go back into their own half. Confident. Well, they have turned up here feeling like they can beat England today. You can tell by their body language, the way they're chasing the ball. Strelitz now on the edge of the area, trying to get it down. It wouldn't bounce forward and played into the box. Now the chance under goal! Stranc! With a right foot from the angle, and it is Slavakia who opened the scoring. And they deserve it. A super start to the match from them. 24 minutes on the clock. He scores his third goal of these Euros. And it's England, Nils Slavakia won. Well, this is massive, massive pressure for England now. What a start to the game from Slavakia. When I'm looking down, John, I don't think Mark Gehrig, was it Kobe Mainu? Oh, it's Gehrig down in the box. Whoever the recovering player was, it's Gehrig, isn't it? It was recovering, and he's caught the heel. I mean, it's a lovely goal from Slavakia, but he's caught the heel of one of the players, and he's not really getting back up onto his feet. I mean, it's super football, but there's so much time and space on the ball that they have, John, to find the right pass, lovely run into the box from Schrantz, who gets found by his teammate, he gets his head up, Pickford's coming out, and he just flicks the ball, with the outside of his right boot, slot it into the corner, and Mark Gehrig receiving treatment in the six-yard box. Yeah, this is... This could be a problem for Mark Gehrig. Let's go down behind the goal to Ersy Christensen. Taking my eyes off the pitch, and just looking at all the England fans behind me. Every single one of them has exactly the same facial expression. They're all in shock, and we have the luxury here of looking up at the big screen, and I know you guys have it on your side as well. But as the replay was being shown on the big screen, all the fans were starting to point, going, who's tracking that runner, who's doing that, and they're all really frustrated. Big goal for Slavakia, though. What a finish, I must say. I think Mark Gehrig is going to be OK, look, he's feeling his collarbone, his neck. It's hard to see where he is. I think it's with the challenge. There's an initial challenge in the air that he loses out on, and it has been that kind of start. I have to say, Slavakia had started brilliantly, and he's caught his shoulder, or popped his shoulder, or collarbone, or something in that challenge. It's a heavily strapped there, I can see that. So it's obviously an existing injury, so as much as it wasn't a huge impact, that's probably something that he's just been struggling with, so maybe just that knot, when you're not expecting it, it just throws you a little bit. England-nil, Slavakia won, and the shock is on. Would it be a shock the way that the match has been played? That's a good question. Given the form, and how Slavakia have started this game, they've got belief this team, they really have. They firmly believe they're good enough to beat England today, and so far the evidence would say that they can. Yeah, they've already beaten Belgium at the tournament, Schranz scored the goal there in that match, and they were able to see that out for a 1-nil win. Now Schranz, who has become the joint-leading scorer at the tournament, scored in three of the four matches now. It's a cute finish as well, wasn't it? Composed from the right-sided midfielder. That was a cracking goal. Super composure, lovely run. And the past, the trouble is, we lose that initial header, the ball drops down into the second ball phase, and the distance is massive. There's so much time for the midfield player. I think it might have been Kutsko, actually, who had the ball, who slid it through behind the back four, the run from Schranz was perfect, but there was so much time, John. I mean, it was pretty comfortable for them. And it's been a big problem with England's in the Euros in this tournament, which just haven't got tight enough or close enough to the opposition to stop them playing, and Slovakia will take full advantage of it. So England now behind for the first time at the Euros. They've got the ball inside their own half. Pickford comes out of his penalty area, and actually urges Stones to go forward. Rice does exactly that, gives it to Tripier. The England players as well, as he was talking about, the fans looking up at the big screen, that's a sort of four-sided cube that hangs above the centre-circle here. The England players were doing that as well, when Gay was receiving treatment. He is back on the field, incidentally, Mark Gay. So the England players as well, keen to see it again. Ivan Schranz's goal in the 25th minute to put Slovakia one nil up. Slovakia have never beaten England since the break-up of the former Czechoslovakia. He has Rice, Rice out to the left-hand side. Tripier. Tripier just gives it back towards the halfway line. If you remember the last match before Gareth Southgate took over, was against Slovakia. Sam Aladais' only match when they won right at the end in Trinabar, with a goal from Adam Lallana, as Hanskor again comes forward. Bellingham. Bellingham, nice change of feet from him, moves infield into the centre-circle, turns back, passes it right for it to Saka, who takes that down again. Lovely control from him in the challenge from Haraslin, which is deflected out of play for a throw in to England. Saka takes this back to Walker. So right now with this scoreline, we're looking at a quarter-final of Switzerland, Slovenia, and England will be going out. Bellingham passes it to Tripier. Tripier then infield to Foden, Foden controlled it, tried to stab it forward to Harry Kane, Kane chasing down into the full-back position. Slovakia get it away where it's headed away by Kutska, then Duda's battling for it in there, and an excellent midfield three. Duda, Lobotka and Kutska, they know their jobs. I'll tell you what, there, midfield three has been exceptional in this opening half an hour. Lobotka is everywhere with and without the ball, anticipation. I mean, he's intercepted there, he comes across, he's reading the play. The ball's coming in, I think it was either Foden maybe had come inside, he just steps in, puts the pressure, nudges the play, gets a toe on the ball, wins it back. Little subtle things like that all the time. He is really playing out of his skin. Harry Kane putting pressure on Dubravka of Newcastle, the goalkeeper who passes it out for a throw into England on the far side. So there's applause for Harry Kane for that. Half an hour played, England one nil down, and Slovakia doing their thing again. They were in that very tight group, Ukraine and Romania and Belgium, lost to Ukraine, drew with Romania, and here they are now in position where they could reach a quarter final for the first time as Slovakia gave back to the halfway line. And then Dalingham in a deeper lying position, it's passed out to the right-hand side to Saka. Now Jude Dalingham again, right is available, Dalingham drags it back, uses Manu, then Dalingham, that's a lovely ball to Saka, Saka now against Skriniar in the box, right foot across, that's beyond Foden at the back post who has to scamper out, it's kept in very well by Trippia, Foden then takes it up, here's Harry Kane left side of the box, Kane curls it into the back post, but that's over the jump of Saka and all the way through for Golke. We can only come inside the pitch when the ball is on the left-hand side, I mean it's been a problem for me for a while but in this match it's so glaring, you want to get at the right back, you want to isolate him 1v1, there's never, it's never on to play wide, there's no whip stretching the pitch on that side, you're almost playing with just one flank available, which is the right-hand side with Saka who does like to stay out here but it's just coming inside every time off our left-hand side and it's just making the pitch so much smaller. The score here in Gelsenkirchen, England 0, Slovakia 1, the Lobotka, is being chased by two England men, Foden and Bellingham and he uses Vavro back in his penalty area, long ball away from him and John Stones is able to to control it. Well England, their supporters want England to play on the front foot, dominate teams, they're 1-0 down and there will be a point where they have to throw caution to the wind and go at Slovakia, here's Trippier and back to from Foden to Trippier but that pass doesn't reach, Rice is kept in on the far side by the goal scorer, Schrantz and then Declan Rice is able to pull the ball down and Koby Mainu, 10 yards inside his own half, Garry Southgate watching in that cream shirt on the edge of the coaching area anxiously, here's Saka, now is able to chest the ball down but he's under pressure from Hans, goes exceptionally well, Hans goal then forward to Strelitz but who miscontrolled it and then Mainu just gets there, Kane inside his own half goes for a long pass that's intercepted, cleared away back to Harry Kane and then Kane just sensibly plays it to Rice in the centre circle I mean how well has Hans gone playing at left back as well, really getting tight to Saka, comfortable enough to get really tight and steal the ball off him, Bellingham that's good, now Trippier, Bellingham Bellingham wriggles into the penalty area, still going to the byline, chips it across, took an affection that takes it behind, into corner to England, and a big wave of the hands from Jude Bellingham to try and get the crowd up on their feet, get the fans behind England, he drives into the box, four or five Sevacian players all around him, they have to be careful, they stand off enough, tries to cross it with his left foot and is blocked and out for a corner well he has been more involved, it is more positive from Bellingham, here's the corner then, England have not really threatened from set pieces, Trippier waiting to take this, the referee just blows his whistle again, Trippier backs away, Kieran Trippier with the corner, into the near post, Kane was after it but it was headed by the near post by Vavro, we got there ahead of him, John Stones applauds the delivery, the second consecutive England corner, Trippier once more, behind him the backdrop is all of those England flags in the stands, Trippier still waits, Stones takes up a position at the near post and then in it goes, towards the near post the referee is buttering an infringement, was it a foul by Stones, was it Mark Gaye, it's a free kick down there to Slovakia and that was just a few yards away from Izzy Christensen, yeah Slovakia are playing a game that England aren't really used to playing, England are operating with a lot more control but every time England get into the attacking third the fans are obviously responding, the noise is deafening and then the response from Jude Bellingham on that last attack, he was geeing the crowd up getting everyone off their feet so they want it, of course they want it but it's coming and they've got to make it happen. Joel Hart up here, are you worried for England? Look it's definitely not been easy, it's a tough game, I think Slovakia look really organised as we expected, the way Lobocca's kind of orchestrating that I'm really enjoying watching him play from a neutral point of view but it's fits and starts isn't it, it's not a smooth performance by any means but we are creating chances, we do look dangerous but it's fits and starts and we're just crying out for that rhythm and it looks like Slovakia have really got that. Yeah they have, they look like a team, they're leading 1-0, I do feel that there's a very strong possibility of more goals in this match on the play that we've had, the goal that we scored, I think this sums them up really and sums up the spirit that they've got, it was Strelets who played it through so this is the striker who was on loan at Slovan Bratislava, the Slovak champions and he was scored by Trance of Slovia Prague. So in a normal sense you would say England would be strong, strong favourites dominating the game, their coach was saying yesterday this England scored it's worth 1.5 billion euros, our teams were at the 150 million. Yeah it's a good point, it's a really good point but they're playing like a team and Martin who was on earlier, Slovakian expert, that was the key point he made and that is what Calzón is all about, getting them to play to the strength of what he feels is the best way to be the best team and he picks the players accordingly and you can see it on the pitch, they're very well organised, they're pressing together and not all the time, they're not that suffocating high-pressure, letting England have the ball and we're just not moving the ball quickly enough, it's now with John Stones and between Pickford and it's just so pedestrian John, you're not going to break that down, there has to be more tempo to the play and then eventually Pickford just kicks the ball long. Yeah long pass from Pickford, Saker in on the challenge, hooked away by Haras Linn and all of the time with Slovakia having a 1-0 lead while England do look depressed forward then that opens the possibility for a second goal for Slovakia and here they are inside their own half challenge on Kutsk, Minu back to Dalingham, that was smooth from Dalingham and then he actually stood on the ball right and ended up being wrestled by Gouda and it's a great kick to England on the right hand side, lovely the way that he moved away there, his influence has been significantly great at Dalingham in this game. It has, I mean he just does some things that you look at and think how does he even think, I don't think he does think, he just does it, it's like the ability to see opportunities to sink in and out of situations and he does it in a fashion that's so smooth, I mean he's a joy to watch at times through Dalingham. We've got seven minutes to go to half time, Slovakia leading 1-0 folding to take this in from the right, the right flank left footed free kick in it goes, swirled excellent header away I think it was Skrinjar hooked away by Lobotka on the edge of the box, comes back to England, comes back to Walker who is quickly put under pressure, used Trippia, Trippia's angled high ball into the area, Rice gets his head to it to Brafko, comes challenge on him, that's not given us a free kick, the challenge by Dalingham and the ball is cleared towards the halfway line. They've defended the box really well there, top quality delivery in, I have to say the left footed cross from Bowdoin was brilliant. I think Kavro has ended up down in the referee's stop play so there's a chorus of whistles and the referee has waved on the medical people, Harry Kane has gone across, in fact I think to Brafko the goalkeeper actually caught Kavro with his hit as he came out. He clatters him, he comes for the ball to Brafko, he has to win it and he does that quite well, gets a right-handed punch on the ball but then the follow through really does clatter his teammate. Job? Yeah I see that, I've seen that England have a ploy, it looks like they're trying to whip it in on Dabravko actually, especially from the Kieran Trippia corners, I was interested to see who would take that free kick then and Foden did with the line being as deep as it well as high as it possibly could but I feel like England are really trying to put pressure on him, he's common he's done well there but in the previous when we had two or three corners in a row I think his defence had defended him really really well winning some really really big headers as we just see the replay of the goal now. Under the pressure of Mark Gay he potentially a foul, I think he's done really well to just outside of the foot, really really good finish, settle himself and a deserved lead. It's an area I think we can do better on those set pieces though Joe, I mean it was a real strength of England's wasn't it in previous tournaments and it hasn't quite been that this time. Yeah I've definitely not felt it, I've not felt the anticipation, I've not felt the buzz when a free kick's coming in, I've not seen too much in the way of different run-ups, different line-ups when it comes to it and especially this one, like I say it looks like they're going they're really going old school and they're looking to whip it on Dabravko and put as much pressure as they can. So Joe Hart, Matthew Upson, Izzy Christensen with us five live in the World Service, the football daily at the Euros will be available from BBC Sounds in the morning and right now there'll be some very unhappy England interviews in it if it stays like this. 1-0 to Slovakia from that Ivan Shrentz goal which puts him alongside Mikau Tadze and Muzeala as the joint leading scorers at the Euros, the Georgians tonight playing Spain, that's our next commentary with Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton who will be inside the stadium in Cologne so that's still to come tonight but here England up against it, Neynu back to Gae, Vavro has come back onto the field so he's okay and Slovakia are back up to their full complement. Here's John Stones who is in deep discussions with Gara Southgate on the edge of the pitch while Vavro is receiving his treatment Gae that's a good ball to Trivia, now to Foden on that left flank, Orange Boots comes in field, White strapping on his hand, Foden then back to Neynu, calm from him to Walker, Walker then back to Foden, White central, Foden's able to take the ball away, look for the space then curls into the box but that's way beyond Trivia and through, all the way through for a goal kick. A nice run from Trivia looking to get in behind but really difficult ball to execute from Foden, had to be absolutely inch perfect to drop it at that kind of angle, it's quite a straight pass with a little bit of angle just to think it over the top of the Slovakian right back but all just skips out of play and England resets, Slovakia looking to go along with the bracket, banging his studs against the post, that's what you could hear there, the Slovakian supporters in great voice here, they are outnumbered by well significantly by the England fans but what a what a score line they have here inside the stadium, Slovakia are given a throw in on the far side and the assistant appears to have changed his point, he's given it to England's way. I mean was that just on appeal then John, that's because he was adamant, I mean it's miles out, I think the referee could see it from the middle of the pitch, he was about a yard out. Yeah I think I presume it was a discussion between the two of them on there. He's held the ball up really well, Strollik up front, I think he's not charging around, he's not exerting too much energy but when his team needs it, I think he's held it and moved the ball really well. I mean he's not a goal threat is he? Like you say, the role that he's playing is significant, he's looked shattered from the first minute but literally whenever he's got the ball he's still going, there he is, he's on his hunches. Yeah he is, we're ready. Pass down the line from Walker, Saka can't reach that. If it stays like this I think the expectation will be that we will see those changes coming from Garasouthgate. Quite soon you think as well, I mean half time is nearly upon us and I'm sure you may even see a change at half time though, will be quite the clamour for Cole Tarma and I noticed that the television camera has already picked him out, here's Declan Rice, Garasouthgate and his team they could do with a goal before half time. And we are in the 44th minute, but John Stoence has quite heavily challenged. That's a yellow card by Duda. Maybe not, no, it's not. Well, is he feeling okay? I don't know. And that was charitable because Duda is one of the slow backs who's on a yellow card. I mean that's miles more of a yellow card for me than the main one and I tackle earlier because he really just take him out. Yeah, that was deliberate. That was 100% deliberate. He kicks it from behind Joe, it's a yellow card. Yeah, I agree. And there's Gay with the ball inside his own hum across to Stoence and then here to Walker. Walker then forward towards Mikhail Saka who is very tightly challenged by Hans Kov. That's a free kick. England and Garasouthgate's three tournaments have always won the round of 16 match. Remember the penalty shootout against Columbia in Moscow and then as Foden chases this ball downfield, that's headed away. It's flicked away, then Gay back out to Tribbjerg on the far side and then back to Gay. The last Euros it was Germany, that's famous 2-0 win against Germany at Wembley at this stage of the competition and then in Qatar the handsome 3-0 win against Senegal. But this is a different matter. 1-0 down to Slovakia all towards the left-hand side. Three minutes of added time at the end of the first half and then we will try and explain this away. There goes the board. Walker to Kobimenev and then infield from Saka. Jude Dalingham. Inko Skriniar with a challenge on him. That was a heavy one and that will be a yellow card. Skriniar turns as though he can't believe it but out comes the card for the Slovak captain. I just felt, I mean you could see he had the intent in the way he went after Bellingham there and you thought okay you're putting the pressure on but don't do anything drastic and he goes to ground, he slides alongside. I'm not sure if he really does catch him to be honest but there was real intent from Skriniar. Knew what he was doing Matt. Yeah he did and with this referee as Joe's already mentioned you can't take the risk. You whip out that yellow card blink of an eye. However he's a great old professional Skriniar and he took that moment to impose himself on Bellingham even if the yellow card followed. He is Bellingham now to the right hand side. Saka nice footwork from him. He was caught. It was run away by Hanscoe but the free kick had been given and this is a set piece in a good position and then Kyle Walker just grabbing the ball back from Hanscoe but a free kick on the right in added time. Yeah the trailer leg, trailing leg just catches and I'm looking at the replay of the Skriniar one that's a harsh yellow card actually. He does slide on the floor Skriniar alongside Bellingham and he does slightly catch him John but he doesn't kick him. Do you know what I mean? It's not. It was the way Bellingham went down. It was and the referee got drawn into the yellow card. I can see why it feels hard done by but this is a great position. Foden left foot just off the corner of the 18 yard box. Right opportunity to whip the ball in. 90 seconds of the first half left. England up against it. One nil down here in Gelsenkirchen. Foden waiting. One foot in front of the other. The referee sorted out the wall. Then he runs over there next to the penalty spot. So stones and rice near the penalty spot. Bellingham's there as well. Kane's near the back post. Mark Gay up to Foden. Swirls it in to Brabka. Comes I think might have been in two minds. Headed back into the box then flicked forward by Rice. Kane was in an offside position so didn't even go for the ball and Skriniar was able to probably get away. Cheers from the slow back supporters. They're held out there but England come again. Maynou lovely. Maynou's right foot shot. That's deflected wide of goal. It's a corner. Lovely play from Maynou. Takes the ball lovely as he does on the back foot. Drives it several players. Rolls his foot over the ball. Gets a shot up and it could have deflected anywhere. Could have ended up being really difficult for the Brafker but he's gone out for a corner and Trippia is not going to take this one. So this will not be whipped in under the crossbar. It's a left-footed corner from Foden. Trippia leaves him to it. The out swing at towards the penalty spot. It's over Kane. We've got 20 seconds of the first half to go. Maynou then to Saka. Saka's shot. That hits a defender. Bounces out to Maynou on the right-hand side. Maynou kicks on his man Lobotka. In comes the cross. Brilliantly headed away. The halftime whistle is coming any moment. Trippia back to Foden. This will be the last chance to attack in the half. Rice with the cross. That's out of play. It's a corner. The referee looks at his watch. England mill. The time is almost up at the end of the first period. Foden's across there to take it. It's the back here hanging on under real pressure but I have to say they're defending the box. Favreau has got his head on the end of everything so far. Last chance for the half. Last chance for an equaliser. Thordon deep. Kane shoots wide of goal and the whistle goes. It's actually gone for a free kick. Maybe a challenge by Bellingham. It's a free kick to Slovakia and that's the end of that. Yeah the referee's seen something in the box. It's very crowded. I think it's a shot from John Stones actually in the Slovakian play-up. It just goes down quite easily but it is a foul from Stones. He really tries to shrug his man off. Yeah that was hectic. That was a hectic couple of minutes. England really pushing but you know Slovakia stood strong. They stood really strong. A really really really interesting half time coming up. There goes the half time whistle. Gareth Southgate head down. Disappears down the steps and up that mineshaft style tunnel to the dressing room whereas Joe Hart has said he has a very big half time discussion to have and some big decisions to make because at the break with this scoreline England are going out and Slovakia are going through to the quarter-finals. England nil, Slovakia won and here's Mark Chapman who is inside the stadium with us. Just before we get to the overall passes of playing that first half you're going to have to go some to beat them in the air aren't you? Are they committed by any chance? I mean they are going at it. Every challenge, anything that is in the air they are leaping. Like the centre forward it doesn't look like he's going to be much of a goal threat but he's coming across the centre arms and getting older the ball flicking it on, chesting it down. I mean it's impressive what they've done in that opening 45 minutes. It is, even in this day and age you can't beat a good old-fashioned header can you? I'm not self but you've got two big guys next year up there. Mark Upsen heading them away and Joe Hart coming and catching them but I'm not going to be a great in the air is he? Oh I had a decent jump I won't lie. But they're solid aren't they? They really are and my question you know is how long can Slovakia keep up this rhythm and the tempo. England are starting to really grind them down and if anything half-time has just come at the wrong time for England because you could feel the energy behind me here with the fans getting right on top of it and like Joe said a very interesting half-second half-team talk. I mean the stat that's just come on our screen Joe has England at 75% possession as Slovakia RIT 20 back. I'll be honest to me it didn't feel like that at times in that first half but maybe that's because England were doing a lot with their possession. Yeah it doesn't feel like a completely dominant performance that would back that stat up but I think Slovakia have been very good with the ball. They've been very organised, they're playing from the same sort of positions and they've certainly got a way of attacking. England having a lot of possession but an awful lot of it's passing and then with the arms in the air because they're looking for that. They are looking for that forward pass but it's just I think Slovakia strategically are looking very good. The stats was leading because we've had so much time just stood on the ball. I mean how many times the centre back or Jordan Pickford even just stood there with the ball not moved. It really frustrates me because I think even if you're not going to be progressive get a pass off. Just get that tempo rolling it's so slow in the build-up. Who needs to take the initiative on that then because as you say stones to gay, gays to stones maybe to walk and back to stones back back to Pickford maybe out to Trippier back inside. Is it midfielders offering themselves? Is it the defenders going do you know what if there's no option there we'll try and turn them and get in behind them. What is it? Well either bounce it bounce it to someone get it back and then the pitch will change if we're moving and we've got to move off the ball to create that and there's been moments where we have that you see flashes of it and you go oh yeah and then it goes away but foot on the ball at the back for me I just I can't bear it. I'd rather just get a pass off into car walker get it back and then all of a sudden where's the pass now but it's a tempo that you create and we don't have that tempo when we're trying to play through. You may correct me on this Izzy but it feels like most of the players want to take an extra touch. I feel like if it goes into Maynou it goes again very quickly he doesn't he likes to play one touch. Yeah. There are a few of the others who are maybe taking two or three touches and you can feel the frustration in the crowd. Yeah you can and I think you can see you can see that on the pitch that the crowd are responding exactly like you say but Coby Maynou has been outstanding exactly what you say there Chappers. He's been moving the ball quickly he's looked sharp and in advanced positions in and around the box he's been crisp with his passing and I think there's just a little bit of a disconnect between the players that are taking a few more touches than needed because this is a team game this is about a system it's about us working in being fluid together as a team and unfortunately there are a few out there who are taking more touches and I think I can see it frustrating the other players around them but let me be honest here I think this is a better England performance but my word they're one nil down and they've got some they've got some work to do. When you move the ball quickly it's simple it's hard but it's simple and it's that simplicity that then breaks teams down because it's quick and the touches too many touches it just kills it kills the player trying to receive the ball and the pitch is gone so that for me is the reason why even Pickford and the two centre backs while there's nothing on just move it quick and get that ball moving. I've just had some stats typed into the dock by the production team on my behalf. Total shots England six, Slovakia four. What was interesting is that they've also typed in aerial duels one but originally they put an extra one in it so we look like England five, Slovakia 110 which would have been which would have been taking it taking this a little bit too far but 10 Slovakia of one compared to England five. My only other thing before we go to the news you do wonder whether the referee's going to play a part in this because he's fussy isn't he? He seems to be drawn into the if there's something going on in the middle of the field and there's lots of bodies and the tackle goes in he's very keen to get his cards out it doesn't matter the severity of the tackle or the offense he's keen to brandish and then we saw and isolated it to where John Stones was was dawdling a little bit on the ball and took a deliberate kick a yellow card in all of our eyes because it didn't have the drama of about four or five players around it he just let it slide. He's not for me the way he's refereeing the game. I think lots of games have been really well refereed actually this tournament but this one here is making a problem in this game like you just mentioned and it doesn't need to be there but Mattie I think one thing that we'd need to definitely take on board is that referee's not changing. No he isn't so that's the conversation at halftime that referee's not changing whether he's wrong or right he could be getting a second yellow card out or a very soft red card so hopefully not but we'll see. Slovakia won England nil at the Brake Mall from Joe and Matt and Izzy and John to come in the second half on the way as well but at just shy of five two or just shy of seven o'clock actually here in Germany five to six in the UK here's Richard Foster. The voice of the UK and the home of the Euros and the general election 2024. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Spanish police have called off the search for the British missing teenager in Tenerife, Jay Slater. He's 19 and phoned a friend nearly two weeks ago to say he was lost in the mountains. He hasn't been seen since despite a huge search involving emergency workers, search dogs and drones. A reform UK election candidate in Derbyshire has disowned the party and endorsed a local conservative instead. Liam Booth Isherwood says there's a significant moral issue in parts of reform following what he calls reports of widespread racism and sexism. A woman's due in court tomorrow over a social media video allegedly showing a prison officer having sex with an inmate at HMP Ones within London. Linda de Souza Abru is accused of misconduct in public office and people living in an affordable housing development in Edinburgh are facing a 450% rise in their gas bills. The homes are connected to a district heating system where one huge boiler provides heating and hot water. Residents aren't able to shop around and those in two bedroom flats could pay as much as £400 a month for their gas. That's how the Slovakia goal sounded on radio. Slavensko, they lead by a goal to nail maybe if England equalised John Murray will do something similar. To Andy Murray who says he should be able to make a decision tomorrow afternoon or evening about completing a Wimbledon. The championship gets underway tomorrow coverage here on 5 Live from 1pm. Here is Andy Murray with our tennis correspondent Russell Fuller. Andy, it's just eight days since you had that spinal cyst surgery. How much progress do you feel you've made over the past week? What have you been able to do on the practice court? How are you feeling? Yeah, a lot of progress. Whether that's going to be enough or not, I don't know yet. I practiced on the grass last couple of days, last three days I practiced on the grass and then played a set today. I'm going to play a set again tomorrow. I'm going to do some physical testing in the morning before that just to run my movement to see where that is and then you know, I should probably be able to make a decision tomorrow afternoon or evening. Every day it's been getting better and better. I just don't know whether it's enough time. But the way you're talking sounds like you think there's a genuine chance you might now be able to play singles. Well, I played a set today and it was not the best set of tennis I've ever played, but I was hitting the ball extremely well. My team said that if they didn't know what was going on, they wouldn't have been like aware that I had an issue. So, if I can improve a little bit again tomorrow and on Tuesday then, yeah, there's a chance. I think it's more likely that I wouldn't play singles if I'm being honest right now, but we'll see how the next couple of days go. But it bodes well for the doubles where you'll have an extra three days potentially and it's three sets rather than five. Yeah, I mean, look, it's, to be honest, I'm not so concerned about the amount of like the length of the match and stuff. It's just whether I can feel my leg properly. If I can feel my leg properly, I don't care whether it's five sets or three sets, singles or doubles, but that's what I'm just waiting for the nerve to fully resolve before I'm able to play properly again. And yeah, obviously the more days that go by, the more chance there is of that happening and doubles starting later in the week, obviously gives me a better chance. We've discussed before the difficulty of top athletes choosing the right moment to go out or at least in the right surroundings. If it is a case of going out on a doubles court, on centre court with your brother Jamie alongside you, then from my perspective, it doesn't get too much better than that, does it? Yeah, I mean, well, who says we're going to go out on who says we're going to go out if we get to play on centre? I mean, I think we can win matches, but yeah, I mean, if that's the way it is, then yeah, like I'm okay with that as well. And, you know, obviously me and Jamie had never played here before. So, you know, that'd be really special, not just for me, but I think for all of our family as well. And if that's the way it is, then that's the way it is. And I'll enjoy every moment of that. Andy Murray with Russell Fuller. So coverage of that begins tomorrow on Five Live. George Russell won the Austrian Grand Prix for Mercedes and McLaren's Oscar Piazzari was second. Carlo Sainz was back in third in the Ferrari. The late match this evening at the Euros is Spain against Georgia. Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton are in Cologne and Spain, given the fact that they're the only side to win all of their group matches. Ian are probably the favourites at the moment, along with the hosts. Yes, not only have they won all three matches, they're yet to concede a goal. It's only been done once before in the history of the European Championship. And that was this late the last Euros, of course, went on to win it. And notably as well, Mark, every outfield player has been used in the in this tournament so far. And the fact that they made 10 changes in their last group game means that the first 11 will have had a nine-day rest coming into this game against the surprise package, Georgia. Well, Georgia, Chris, have been one of the most enjoyable sides to watch at this tournament so far. Do you give them any chance? Well, we've got to give them a chance. But personally, I don't. I think Spain will wipe the floor with them. But the victory against Portugal, I think their mindset going into this game is, you know, there are possibilities. But they're going to have to have to be the game of the life, really, to beat this Spanish team. I think they're the best team I've seen in the competition so far. Ian's right about they had the luxury to rest so many players in the last game. They'll come back. This will be against Spain's first 11. And I don't want to take anything away from Georgia, but it wasn't against the strongest Portuguese team. But for them to get... But they've got a good balance about them, Chris. They have. I mean, they're not possession-based. They'll sit deep. I mean, the forwards, perhaps Scalia and Miquetad, I think I'm right in saying, you know, they've been practicing these pronunciations all day. They carry a threat. They play two up top and they keep two up top. But doing that against Spain, I think, is so, so dangerous. And Spain will get overloads in the middle of the push. And that is going to be their problem. But if they hang on in there, they may create one or two opportunities. But I mean, Spain are looking ominous in this competition. All right, Ian, Chris, thank you very much. More from them a little bit later on. Spain against Georgia kicks off an eight thought UK time. All the build-up with those two to come a little bit later on England already, making their way out. Does it look like they're going to make any changes at the moment? They haven't had a shot on target, though, Johan, in that first half. According to Alpe, you have to go back to 1986 for the last time that happened at a major tournament. Was the Harry Kane block tackling the first half? I'm not sure they can alter our character that as a shot on target. But that shows, doesn't it? For all the possession, they've got to have that possession higher up. Yeah, and they were pushing towards the end. Some good crosses coming in, but a resolute defending from Slovakia. Look, the optimistic side of me is saying that we're going to wear them down. We're going to make it tough. And those sorts of last-ditch headers become a lot more difficult. 65, 70 minutes into a game when that possession does add up. So that possession doesn't necessarily win you the game in the first half, but it puts a lot of pressure on you as an opposition, puts a lot of miles in the legs for the opposition, and that pressure is going to build. Oli Watkins and Cole Palmer, the two subs who came out first to warm up during that interval. We shall see if they come on during this 45 minutes is John Murray. The pressure is on. England nil Slovakia won as the second half is about to begin. England unchanged at halftime. Pickford, Walker-Stone, Gaye and Trippier, Menu Rice, Saka, Bellingham, Foden and Kane, and yellow cards already for Bellingham, Menu and Gaye who would be suspended for a quarter-final. But at the moment it's going to be Slovakia against Switzerland. There's the whistle from referee Umut Melair. England kickoff, all in white, back to Pickford, all in green, a long ball down the middle that is headed away by Vavro and the Slovakian team. Dubravka of New Castling goal as they play a ball forward that Walker will steer back with his left foot to Pickford, who gives it back to Walker who's in a little bit of pressure down there but passes it forward to Saka who has to come and get it halfway inside his own half and then Walker goes in field towards John Stones. Slovakia with this press that they've become notable for. Stralets is reading that and England are able to move it through Pickford to Trippier. Pickford's ball out that could give it away, comes off Foden, bounces through the middle for Duda and then Kutska and now on the right hand side the goal scorer at Schrantz and then back to Kutska, Slovakia in this almost all blue kit with the red trim, looked to play it down the line. This is for a run of Schrantz but that is seen behind by Phil Foden for a goal kick. So the Slovakia team unchanged from their previous match Dubravka Ringel, Peckery Vavro, Strinja and Hansko, then Kutska, Lovotka and Duda the central three. Schrantz the goal scorer on the right, Haraslín on the left and Stralets up front. World Service listeners are back with us here on Five Live. Listeners well if you're on the move on BBC sounds. Remember you can listen back as well by a sound to any of our commentaries from the Euros. If England turn this round this might be one of them. Here's Meynu, Meynu now out towards the right hand side to Walker and then Walker pulls it back. Matt Upsons just to my left here. What do you want to see most from England now Matt? I just want to see us move the ball quicker. It's so slow in the build up. I know we're talking about having a lot of possession but it's just sat with Declan Rice. Slovakia have got all their players behind the ball. They're set, they're in shape, they're ready to defend as a unit. We need to catch them when they're out of position and move them around a little bit and you've got to do that by moving it quickly, John. It can't be slow, methodical build up all the time. They're too good at organised team to break down. It's much harder to break down a set unit than if you can move in that position with quick play. Matt Upsons next to me. Joe Hart's here as well. Izzy Christensen down at touch line. Saka there. Very tight hands go with the challenge out of play for a throwing to Slovakia. Now Mark Gay is able to give it back to Pickford on the edge of the area. I'm sure there will be a clamour. Joe for Kul Parma to get him on the field. However, if he does play on the right, Saka has actually been one of England's more effective players as the ball's headed back towards the halfway line for Slovakia. Duda is able to take it away there, then Bellingham puts the challenge in and deflects it out for a throw. Yeah, Saka's look good, but he's in a battle. That's for sure. It's been tough down that side. Some early moments towards the end as well. As England look to get on the press here, obviously it's going to get a little bit excitable in the next couple of minutes if England don't score and don't take a grip of this game. So there will be a clamour, but Gareth proved all along that how he does things. He's not going to be forced into anything, so let's see how this plays out. Time ticking away on England. One nil down, folded after Rice won a free kick. Rice again. England go backwards once more. Now John Stones. Stones, as we see this press again from Slovakia, it is so effective, forcing England right back to the edge of their own penalty area. Stones used to be in very comfortable in possession with Manchester City. Declan Rice is just outside his own box. There's the pass back to Pickford. Short pass to John Stones, and then Bellingham comes short, but again it's square out towards the right-hand side to Kyle Walker. Back to John Stones again on the edge of the box. England fans inside this ground, thousands of them. They'll be sitting rather nervously watching this as Walker comes forward and uses the pass to Saka. Saka now in field to Kane. Kane first time touch. Lovely pass. Trippier could be in on his left foot across, it comes in from Foden. There's no flag. Foden turns it in, and England equalise. Five minutes into the second half, they're back on level terms, and it all came from the pass from Harry Kane. Trippier then Foden with the final touch, and it's England once for Vakia 1. Well, Phil Foden keeps his discipline here, keeps his wick really well. It's great play from Kane, he recedes the ball, sees the opening wide, and it's just really unselfish play. It's good build-up. For the first time in the game, really do stretch the Vakia. The wick is there, and the tap in is in, but there's a real chance that this is going to be offside. I think that I felt it at the time, I'll be honest, that I felt offside. He's drifted just in front. I mean, he's Trippier with the wick. He's on that left-hand side, but he certainly looks comfortably offside, Joe. I think Slovakia, they looked on their knees there. They looked like... Yeah, goals ruled out. That's a big moment, that's a huge moment in the game. That's going to give them energy. I felt like Slovakia felt, you know what, we've done okay, but this is going to be tough now. Yeah, really disappointing to see. The goals ruled out, it remains England-nil, Slovakia won. A clear decision. And Phil Forden after the big celebration, well, that is caught in his throats and the throats of the England fans. Down to pitchside, is he Christensen? Okay, we'll see if we can make contact with Izzy in a moment, that it is a free kick as a result that is taken by Dubravka. So that's another goal England have had ruled out for offside. England come again though with Kane into the penalty area against Skriniar. Kane with a chance deflected, or deflected wide. It did look as though the ball was going to drop into the net from our position up here, but instead that touch did take it away from goal wide of goal of Favreau's right instead. It's a corner, man. It was so hard to see whether that was going to drop cruelly into the near post of the Slovakian goal there as the ball deflected up in there. Loads of spin on it, it bounces and it just goes wider that post. Here's the corner, this from Trivia, pushed away by Dubravka almost on the goal line underneath the crossbar and back to Walker in the centre circle. Walker has a look forward that the option was Kobe Maneu, so it goes back to Jordan Pickford, the goalkeeper who it's a long pass that actually Trivia is going to do well. He does chest it down, played in field, Clodin, but Clodin is challenged by Lobodka and England go back into their own path. I mean even though that goal's chalked off, it looks like it's given us a little bit of belief I have to say to know that we can break through. If we get one or two passes off and move the ball well, create the space, keep our width, all of a sudden there's an opportunity with Trivia all the way down the left and we have to keep hanging on to that. We've got to develop that belief, John, that we can move the ball past it cleanly and create that space and if we do we'll create chances. Well we are in the thick of a European championship knockout tie here, no question. England 1-0 down, striving to try and find an equaliser. Rice slips the ball forward, that's intercepted by a sliding doodah that puts it out of play for a throw for England on the far side in the second half. England attacking towards the end where the Slovakia fans are, they've been in great spirit. A throwing that is taken by Walker, Kane controls it on the edge of the box, Kane works it back to Saka, Saka pulls it across but cleared away by Fabro, comes back out to England though, Manu, tests it down Manu, then back to Rice, Slovakia got everyone back behind the ball. In their matches, they've been looking back at them, you know when teams put pressure on them, you can get at them but England straining for the breakthrough, Trippia can't reach that and it is cleared up the lane but that just gives possession back to England. Yeah I mean they are struggling a bit, I have to say they can't keep hold of the ball Slovakia, their coach Calzone is just shouting at the players to try and get up the pitch but you need to have the ball if you want to get up the pitch because England now will have another patient build up and a wave of attacks will come and you just feel they will start to tire and holes will start to appear. 1-0 Slovakia lead if you've just got into your car, England are heading out, they're going out here in the round of 16 with this score line, here's Walker on the right hand side, Walker is tripped, that's a free kick, free kick ten yards inside the Slovak territory and we would have Slovakia as Slovak, oh they've taken the free kick quickly, Pickford's going to struggle to get there and it bounces wide, the shot from Strelitz in the centre circle, quick free kick, Storns and Bellingham and Meen who were nowhere near it and Strelitz went for goal through the centre circle and very nearly scored. Goodness me what a disaster that really actually should have been because if Strelitz has any quality with his left foot it's not a difficult chance to convert from that race John, he had the whole goal to Amat, it didn't have to be inch perfect the shot, he should hit the target, that should be a goal, he's so sloppy from England. Guys this is where you earn your money, how on earth do you explain that on the radio, that is almost impossible to explain what's just gone on there, it was it was sloppy play, John Storns not aware of a short pass being made to him. Pickford goes for a long pass, Trippier I don't think they'll get there and do a graph because they would have taken it up on the end of the year. It was a very nonchalant pass though Joe, wasn't it? It wasn't the clear I'm taking this free kick and I'm going to pass it to you. It's the wavelengths that we're talking about that were just not quite on and that sloppy isn't it? Jordan Pickford's heart must have been racing, look at him there, he's taken some deep breaths, he was chasing back to goal thinking I'm dead here, this is a huge moment. I think if that falls to one of the midfield three that's in the back of the net because they'd have the quality to hit the target with that, he should score. It was an escape for England most certainly and I think Joe Hart is a very recently retired goalkeeper that must have really brought back the memories as Trippier plays it in field towards Rice in the centre circle. Rice goes for one of his passes, trademark passes, struck it well to Saka. How many times has he done that this season for his club and then Saka takes on the defender, still going, there are two of them there then cuts back onto his left foot and actually hands good as well and hands good, he's giving it away under pressure from Saka, then Manu to Foden, Manu, Manu's still going, there's the ball to the right hand side to Walker, Walker cuts it back to Foden, Foden, his ball into the area left foot, it's plain challenging for it, that was headed away though by Peccarique on the edge of the six yard box, this is good pressure from England but we've already played 10 minutes in the second half and the equaliser has not come even though England have had the ball in the net as they did in the previous match against Slovenia but from an offside position. The ball just hasn't stuck as well to Harry Kane as what you'd expect in this game, a couple of loose touches, it's not really going into him and he's holding it, he's bringing players into play. Trepia, then to Manu, John Stones, forward of the centre circle, Stones rolls the ball out towards Walker on the right hand side, Walker taking on Haraslín, Saka comes short, there's Foden over towards the right hand side, Foden's ball in, he's looking for Kane, in fact it's Bellingen under pressure from the defender Peccarique who goes down in a heap and Bellingen has said something there to Peccarique and Dubravka's pointed that out to the referee and Jude Bellingen is on a yellow card but the referee is going to take no further action although he turns, Harry Kane is there or thereabouts as well as the captain. I think Bellingen knows that Peccarique is experienced enough to be buying time here, they're under masses of pressure here, Slovakia, there's a challenge from Bellingen, he knows he hasn't caught him but Peccarique goes down on a heap on the floor just to take this thing out of the game, slow the pace down which there has happened and then now restart the game and Bellingen has to be careful, he just doesn't get, go too far shall we say in terms of expressing that. Yeah if England lost a man now, if they went down to 10 then I think you can begin to make plans for the playing home. Slovakia look tired guys, they look really tired, they look like they're hanging on and it's very early in the game to be hanging on with the quality of England they have got. And actually that coach Calzona is going to make a couple of changes so it's actually Slovakia who are going to make the changes first as the ball has flicked forward but Gage's able to. Well he's had five substitutes quite vigorously warming up down to the right hand side for ever since that they came out for the second half so I should imagine he needs fresh legs as well and there's two getting stripped. Yeah Suslov is going to come on and also Boženik up front, here's Bellingen through the middle, lovely change of feet again from right to left then it opens up from through the middle in fact he gives it square to Declan Reis, Menu, England still one nil down, Trippia on the right, Trippia curls it in, headed away well by Skriniar, excellent header from the Paris Saint-Germain player, comes out to Reis, Reis is able to give it to Menu, Menu now to the left hand side, Trippia back centrally to Koby Menu, Walker makes a run in fact the pass goes square to Reis, back square again to Menu, Menu is going to take it on himself into the penalty area where he's reaching it down by Kutska and Kutska is on a yellow card you know in the match. Well he's got to be careful I mean he just takes Menu's back leg as he goes past him but this is all about the decision making from Koby Menu, he gets the ball he sees a tiny hole and he thinks right I'm going to go for it, he drives with it really quickly, gets the drop on Kutska, he'll have to slide in and just wipe him out, he is quite fortunate John I mean it isn't a second yellow offence but it's on the edge isn't it? So free kick to England, Kieran Trippia who's not scored for England since the World Cup semi-final in Moscow back in 2018 I thought it might be Kane from this angle you'd have thought that Kane would have yeah but clearly Trippia is the there's the choice although Foden is there as well with the left foot but you would think that Trippia would have to go for goal here. You'd think so I mean it's a great angle and the distance is very good it's about probably seven or eight yards outside of the the penalty box but it's just to the left hand side so it's perfect for a right footer. Well how many times will Kieran Trippia have practiced this free kick against Martin Dubravka? Is clubmate Foden to the right of the ball it's actually Foden into the wall and advances away to the halfway line and Trippia actually recovers it and then plays a right footed ball for the advances all the way through for a goal kick. I'll try to be a little bit clever there maybe it's interesting tack because Foden with his left foot takes it they're trying to catch Dubravka out because I think they're feeling Dubravka really does feel that Trippia is going to take it and he's trying to bend it into that near post area but not high enough over the wall. So Slovakia now make these two changes and Thomas Susloff of Verona is going to come on to replace Haras Linn who has faded in the game it must be said so the number seven will come on for him over on the left hand side as there is also Strelitz is down I think he's coming off anyway isn't he? Yeah yeah to be replaced by Robert Buzh is down to pitch side is he Christensen? Hello up there Joe's called it hasn't he the Slovakians are getting tired and they're responding I want to see England respond but I'm just watching the fans and the contrast between the the celebrations when Foden found the back of the net and then the feeling afterwards when VAR choked it off they're getting increasingly frustrated and I can really feel it transmitting out here down to me and then on to the pitch and they've got to keep their heads and let's hope for some fresh legs in that England front line. Well we are now into the last half hour so when are the England subs going to come? Well I'm just looking at them on the big screen warming up they're down there on the touch line going through their paces and looking at Oli Watkins Gallagher I very much say Eze is down there as well and I think we will surely see somebody soon but I'm not surprised that the centre forward who's just gone off Strelitz I mean he looked tired after 15 minutes he's lasted an hour and he has put a shift in. I think it's forward pass for us all the way through to De Braf goes looking for Foden it's over armed out that could have been given away by Trippia got their defender Peckery did well Rice takes it on down the left hand side Rice comes through the challenge his ball into the box bounces all the way through to De Braf go in Trippia has stayed down there and he's saying he's got a problem so De Braf has put the ball out of play it was full body weight into his kind of shin or ankle I mean he's kicking the floor here in Trippia's holding his right leg but he overran the ball there Peckerych and when he goes in for tackle he actually catches him really nastily it's a bad tackle that's a bad tackle yeah that really is I mean he gets a little bit of the ball but kind of by chance Joe he's got ricochets and hits him he doesn't actually win the ball with the tackle he makes contact after his kick Trippia I can't make sense of the rhythm of the referee no we don't want to be sat up here talk about referees but his rhythm in his decision making I thought the free kick on the edge of the area obviously on a yellow card it's tough to give a second yellow card but there's just no consistency but England in the ascendancy the threats there obviously I know everyone will be clamouring for a change but I think the boys that are on the pitch at the moment actually looking very settled in this game getting some rhythm to it like we say we're looking at the subs that are warming up at the moment they're not the ones that I think will be coming on yeah speaker that Cole Palmer stripped them ready to go yeah it's going to be Cole Palmer as the cheer the England fans behind the the dugout there they get to their feet they start applauding that's the last thing you need to see if you're a Slovakian player oh yes oh wow a tiring team with Palmer coming on but who's coming off? Vukaiyo Saka has been called across by Garrett Southgate Mark Gay it is who's been called across Trippia is is just climbing to his feet I think it is Saka who's going to come off yeah he's being spoken to isn't he by by Declan Rice I'm not sure I mean Declan Rice is having a real word in his ear whether or not he's shifting position or he is going to come off well Saka runs over to this side of the field Garrett Southgate's going to speak to him we won't see the change yet I mean I'm not I'm not sure if Trippia can continue I think Saka's going to go to left back John okay Saka's dropping dropping into the left back position I'm going to see Saka at left well he is for now and now now Trippia's back on the field but I think they're waiting to see if Kieran Trippia can actually continue because he's hobbling along England nil Slovakia one time beginning to run out as Bellingham has tackled and now here's the newly arrived Bosjanik Bosjanik the the number nine who started the first two matches at the tournament for Slovakia little ball forward now to the right hand side where it's played in by Schrantz the goal scorer now Gouda receives it 35 yards out left hand side in comes the cross from Hansko into the penalty area right struggling to get it away just gets there first and his foul as well on the edge of the box and it's helped to his feet by Kruzka that's another that's another foul by Kruzka he's making a free end and here's the change and it's going to be Trippia off yep not able to continue so this is going to be Bukaya Saka at left back it is it is and I totally understand the change I mean Deccan Rice was having quite a word with him he took some information on board from Garisalve gate went across had a long discussion with his arson teammate and Saka is now next to Mark Gehrhe in that left back position but he just saw the benefit of fresh legs for Slovakia it was Bosjanik that just robbed the ball off for Jude Bellingham a moment ago and just that ejection of energy is that they've desperately needed that the Slovaks and whether or not that'll help them defend this lead we'll have to wait and see but they've certainly got a bit more legs in the team now England Nils Slovakia won five live in the world service from the BBC Spain against Georgia to come tonight on five live as Deccan Rice off winside his own half will play the ball to the right hand side and stones now picks out a pass to Palmer involved for the first time the Chelsea man the Premier League young player of the season back it goes from him to John Stones stones his former teammate at Manchester City as Koby Manu receives it from him and England well the England fans want to see them on the front foot here they're up against this tiring Slovakia team but still the goal won't come the equaliser and actually England have got it in their own half Palmer has been forced to to carry it there and now gives it to gay gay's been put under pressure he has been fouled by Trance for it's brilliant pressure at this stage of the game from Trance to be that high on care he's touched but England have picked up a quite interesting format it's a bit of a 4-1-4-1 now he's got kind of Bellingham Palmer Foden all the way along Harry Kane higher up the pitch Sackers advancing quite the way up as well it's really having to throw everything at it as you'd expect at this stage in the game 23 minutes or so left and England desperate for a goal England facing an exit at the last 16 unless they can come up with something it's the first time since Euro 2016 the famous infamous defeat against Iceland this would be considered I'm sure on a par but I think that would be to underestimate this Slovakia team Rice Rice now there's a Slovakian player down on the far side here is Saka now playing as the left back Rice goes for a big Trossfield pass this is for Palmer Palmer takes it down on his left instead Bellingham's there with him Palmer's ball in Foden tried to get his head to it but it was blocked by Vapro and deflected way to goal for corner you cannot give Cole Palmer that kind of space coming inside on his left foot he will find the perfect pass and that was just a shame Phil Foden didn't make any contact with the ball he got the distance off the centre back it just needed a glance in header would have caused the Brafka a real problem and he just didn't make any contact and it ricochets up in the air one of the first time the two centre backs have been caught out with a crossing to the box Foden to take this corner for England standing in front of all of the Slovak flags Foden's ball into the near post that's headed up and away effectively as well by Bozjanik who's just come on and then back to the halfway line it goes and England will have to start again we are now into the final quarter of the match here in Gelsenkirk and England with Foden is still on the right flank after taking that corner he holds the ball up chest puffed out then his passing field towards the number four Declan Rice Rice skips away from a couple of challenges takes it away from the Botker again Foden left foot ball into the back post but that's beyond and over the top of Harry Payne and it's through for Goldkirk yeah not the best if Cross is in from Foden just kind of floats it really it's not got a lot of intent drops back onto his left foot Kane peels for the back to post Bellingham's running the near post but I mean I have to say Slovakia defensively in terms of the Crosses this is I mean I haven't seen two centre backs enjoying defending the bots as much as this in a long long time Joe has been outstanding as they've edited it really well as a goalkeeper's perspective to feel that and see that it has to be so precise for us to get inside and someone get a chance near post they're taking they're taking hold of everything they're meeting it as high as point and really really getting rid of it I think the only chance you've got to beat in them is if a run is going to get across the face of them like that situation with Foden there you're not going to physically dominate them in the air today I think they're just they're just too good at that a hopeful cross no chance it needs to be you know concise and organised in what we're doing yeah that's Joe Hart and Matt Upson England internationals both up here in the commentary position Pecker Eakley very tired there when he miscontrolled the ball out England coming toward again Kane through the middle Palmer's available on the right there could be space here for England Palmer's ball across Bellingham with a touch the challenge in on him Bellingham works it back I'm not sure there was enough therefore a penalty even though the England fans want one now Rice back out to the right-hand side to Palmer suddenly he's creating the spark called Palmer as he's challenged but manages to shrug it off now Kobe Mino back to him Mino goes for the high ball into the penalty area that's hit overhead and it's caught by Dubravka I think I was a little bit naughty from Drew Bellingham that tries to con the referee it's a dive here should be simulation really John there's barely any contact he's going down before the contacts made he can see Kutsker who let's face it he's got about the pitch and kicking nearly everyone on it yeah today he's knowing that the contacts coming and he goes down and tries to win the penalty right right in front of the referee as well all the while there's the threat of a second goal for Slovakia Hans Cole as Slovakia move into England territory but then England forced them back into their own half that would have been big move from referee Mala that's a heavy back pass back to Dubravka to clear it away downfield onto the head of Kyle Walker and then stones back to to Pickford so Slovakia still leads through that goal from Ivan Schrantz in the 25th minute of the match they've been ahead it feels for a long long time England are on knocking on the door they've had the ball in the net Foden was offside now England here is Saka now on the left flank Saka infield towards Rice Dalingham makes a run through the middle but Rice goes over there to the far side with his pass to Parma Walker joins in in fact it's Manu who receives it Manu through the middle now to his left to Declan Rice Rice Foden on the left flank Foden has Saka there with him back it comes towards Rice again the whistles from the Slovakia fans that parked behind the ball Manu there's been forced away from the penalty area back it comes again to the Manchester United teenager now Declan Rice Rice with a forward pass towards Balingham Saka is there this is tricky for England to find a way through they need a bit of craft a bit of imagination maybe Balingham can provide it lovely turn away from the blocker Balingham then takes it down the left side into the box cuts back onto his right foot here's the cross and then Skriniar is there to head it away for Slovakia only back to the white shirts of England again this is this is a real cup tie feel to this England the favourites coming into this Slovakia the underdogs and in the classic cup tie scenario it's the underdogs who lead by one goal to Nel Foden and time running out for Garrett Southgate and his team in his 99th match in charge there's a big question now whether he'll make it to 100 a slow back player goes down England don't put the ball out of play Balingham then square towards Rice Rice through the middle but that just bounces back for Slovakia and they will bring it forward and actually do that there's going to pop it down and play so the physio can come on he can't blame them to be honest I mean this is all part of it it's the gamesmanship it's to know him what you need to he does actually really roll his ankle he's not faking it so there's a lot of booing going on around the stadium like he's just staying down but when he puts his foot down there he really does roll the ankle quite badly it's not not nice and it gets kicked out there's a chance for the players to break in Garrett Southgate just having a word with Mark Gehr here a couple of players but this is this is big-time stuff John this is this is a real it's on the line oh it's massively on the line listen to with Peckery the 37 year old right back Tiring I mean do we do you want to see Anthony Gordon running at him absolutely someone run run at him isolated but we've got to move the ball out there we've done it once on the goal and the space was there but it just hasn't happened often enough and my worry is is even though they are tired what this means to Slovakia to win this game against I mean they're going to find the strength they're going to find the energy to be able to to deal with it because they'll dig into the reserves it's such a big moment for them yeah they're World Cup or a European championship just the third time that they've been in a round of 16 and listen I'm not forgetting the fact that Slovakia as part of Czechoslovakia did actually win the thing back in 1976 and there were a majority of slow back players in that team but as Slovakia this would be so so special and to do it in the spirited way that they have well Suslov has received treatment so he's off the field for 30 seconds play resumes and we have now got only 15 minutes to play England 15 minutes from going out and this would be seen as an unmitigated failure in Garo Southgate's last tournament in charge but it's not over yet as Slovakia they come they're coming forward now whether they get a second goal that might be it and it is with Trance on the right hand side Trance back to Kutskja here is Lobotka Duda as well lovely touch Lobotka just so economically is just back to the halfway line Skriniya Lobotka under pressure from Rice Lobotka comes away with the ball brilliant I mean the low center of gravity allows him to adjust his angle and position so quickly and sharply I mean he's almost hovering waiting check in his shoulder see which angle Declan Rice is coming from he just pops the ball in the opposite direction gets his body in between Rice in the ball takes the contact and bang plays it I mean he has just been outstanding in this game feet wide apart and then there's a pass forward for a pick that to come out and pick up Joe like the ratty that low center of gravity very calm on the ball he realizes that no one's going to be able to just clip him and take him off guard if you wanted to knock him over you'd really have to hit him hard and with his low center of gravity and his height he's more than more times often going to get the foul yeah such quick feet as well he do well on the dance floor as gay hits a long pass over the top for Bellingham to chase Skriniya got to that and then cold Palmer without question he's the danger man just allows the ball to roll out of play he's brought something again to England he takes a quick throw to Bellingham who goes down rather easily from the challenge from Duda it's not giving us a free kick Bellingham trying to get up and Palmer's in there as well but Slovakia come out with the ball and it's played away downfield but that will just give possession back to England he looks very fatigued due to Bellingham I'm a little bit surprised he's still on the pitch to be honest he just looks tired and you can tell he's just he's falling over when he gets the ball just trying to win a free kick or a foul or something I don't think he's quite got the energy oh then Fordham is fouled by Techery the lovely exchange there by the way between Saka and Foden on the left wing you know that's what you get with the left footer in the Saka position that's a yellow card for Techery so free kick to England out on the left outside so the question would be if you see Bellingham tiring and he's only yellow card as well there's been a couple of nearish things from Bellingham is he the man who makes way to well Gordon is now being cheered and Ezra down there as well the two of them I think we will see them but time really is running out Fordham at the free kick in, game with a header down and wide from eight yards out it was slightly behind him he got his head to it but couldn't direct it into the bottom corner well I just can't believe that isn't in the back of the net what a chance super delivery for once England find the space Kane is unmarked he's a little bit in advance but technically I think the ball kind of just drops on he's not really positioned to guide that inside the post and he gets good contact heads it down and it's about a yard wider than near post he just can't get the right contact that's good and pitch side to Izzy yeah Pickford's reaction to that chance was interesting he's dropped to his knees he's put his hands on the on the floor almost in like a yoga position he knows how close that was and the fans I can feel it behind me increasingly frustrated their facial expressions their nervy thanks Izzy he has Fordham still inside his own half it's just right in the balance here England playing with with fire at the back he's able to get the ball down and take it away from Bozheny and now Maynard lovely from him on the halfway line white shirt pouring forward folding ahead of him Bellingham's on the left hand side here he gives it to Bellingham left footed crossing but that is far too close to the Brafko who can make the catch he's going to see another double change for Slovakia very shortly I'm just looking to see if yep we've got a barrage Eza who is going to be brought on by Garoslavl yes it's going to be really interesting to see who does come off I mean fresh legs for Slovakia as well they're hanging on they're going to freshen up and air the pitch now and all it is is out of possession how much pressure how hard can you be to play against but they've really ran themselves into the ground what a performance as a team regardless of where this game goes John they have just been superb and I think they can see the finishing line now as well the big clock is on the screen right above the centre circle just under the roof 79 minutes and 13 seconds and Rice crossfield pass to Saka Saka takes that down he's up against Peckery and then plays it in field Thoden holds off the challenge again this tireless Slovak side Rice curls it into the box clear away though by hands go sort of flick healed it back healed it away with England players there I can't tell you how good that was John from the left back who has just been superb as well to defend like that and actually get the outside of his left boot and like you say flick the ball away into space where his team is what a piece he defended a 26 year old firenord man as England come again down the right hand side 10 minutes to go one nil Slovakia lead called Parmado for England the substitute now Kyle Walker rolls his foot back to Palmer law ball into Thoden just outside the edge of the penalty area Saka Saka in the fallback position ball across hits the defender Peckery bounces back to the Kyle Saka then back to Rice onto his right foot Rice for the shot hits the post came bounces the shot into the ground up and over and behind the width of a post still one nil Slovakia wow what a moment bang off the upright ricochet back onto the penalty spot and it is a tough chance for Harry Kane it's a great hit from Rice with his right foot steps inside the pitch hits it draws it to the near post back out Kane into the ground he nearly does everything right it is tough to finish Gareth Southgate hands on his head Rice hands on his face and England 10 minutes to go I think there's enough time Joe there's no need to panic but there's going to be more opportunities in this game so many bodies deep in front of Martin DeBrakke they're so hard to get that dive off they're just dropping and dropping they're not even considering playing out Slovakia are shattered and I grew do my matter we don't need to panic here we need to all England need to look for the goal and I think if we can take it to extra time unfortunately not ideal not ideal situation but we're not here for ideal situations we're here to try and win the tournament if we can get them into extra time I think this game's over however Slovakia are winning it a double change for Slovakia Duda and Kutskara both being taken off from the midfield and they have been replaced by Benes and Barrow and in England Concealer throwing on the far side and England when the substitution comes it is well it will be a barrage Eze who is coming on for England and Rice playing the ball back towards the the figure of Jordan Pickford who apart from that scary moment when Strelitz went for goal from the centre circle there's been a virtual spectator in the second half but England now well there are seven minutes plus added time left if it's going to come it's going to be late England couldn't score against Slovenia and now they're being held by Slovakia throwing taken quickly Mainu no couldn't get there and and it is Barrow who gets his first touch and Barrow again to the left hand side Barrow makes a run through the middle and Rice has to get that but he does and he takes the ball on away from Barrow and runs it into his own penalty area I thought for a moment that Barrow was going to nip into score very close really did nearly get the wrong side that they do play some lovely football when they take their time on the ball I think it's the Botker at the heart of it again but they've got nice angles they've got running off the ball the energy they're finding Slovakia to get forward at this stage in the game is impressive John Stones wins a throw in a winter handball free kick on the halfway line and then threatens to take it and push an e-cast to move out of the way right here's the change it's Mainu who's coming on off from the midfield and a barrage as he's coming on on the left hand side well interesting switch I mean Mainu has been absolutely brilliant I think I think he's done a good job stepping into a game like this with England playing how they are and coping with it and actually in the first half as we discussed at half time was was very very good I think he can come off the pitch feeling very proud of his performance one nil Slovakia lead England will be going home tomorrow with this score line Saka to Ezra Ezra now skips in field uses Kyle walk actually the pass was slightly wider than Palmer does as well actually but then Slovakia able to nip in win it back Bellingham's into the challenge Ezra turns brilliant turn as that misses his kick as he went for goal he actually slipped over Bellingham though is onto the loose ball the England fans thousands of them inside the stadium here urging England on Bellingham tries to go around the outside of Suzlop he's fouled it's a free kick he then actually took the ball away but the referee had already blown his free kick on the right five minutes to go just all that I mean I can't believe with five minutes left of the game and we still won nil down but Suzlop just couldn't deal with Bellingham there Riggles passed in wins the foul legitimately but we've had several free kicks from this situation in the game and the delivery's actually been good in but that's how good Slovakia have been at defending them the two set the backs I mean Scrinniar's been immense free kick then for England set peace opportunity folding to swing it in Slovakia winning 1-0 the signal from folding and it goes too close to goalkeeper to Bravket he's able to punch it away you'd have thought he could have caught it he's not caught that I mean you got a punch I took one look at Joe and he just the raised eyes catch it what a punch England again Rice Rice's ball Kane controls on the edge of the box works it to his left half cleared as a ring with the challenge and Slovakia scrape it away and actually bring it away for them into the last five minutes it's probably take the ball to the corner flag time but England win it back ball was played forward by Benesh England to Foden Foden now moves infield into a nest of blue shirts the ball is deflected actually out to Palmer on the right hand side that was a fortunate break of it and then in comes the challenge from hands go out of play throwing really defending again hands go the energy the footwork to get out to Palmer there quickly put the brakes on the justice feet superb Palmer receives a Palmer's ball into the area this one's headed away to comparative safety by Scrinniar comes out for gay now back to Palmer again Palmer couldn't find the pass that Harry Kane cut out on the edge of the box and played away for Slovakia who will look to Poznanique he's still inside his own half but then eventually all they do is give possession back to England these could be the final minutes for Gareth Southgate as the England manager in his 99th match unless his team are able to find the goal here Rice Rice to Foden but it bounces for Slovakia and Poznanique in the centre circle but now blue shirts do come forward and it's it is Schrantz the man who scored the goal such a long time ago in the match Schrantz plays it back to Poznanique Poznanique infield that will break for Lebotka Lebotka shoots for goal and Pickford straight out and is able to pass it down from what 25 yards yeah we never troubled Pickford but it did open up a little bit and I mean I can't believe Slovenia since the back of sorry are still pressing high up the pitch I mean it is pretty unbelievable but I just I never pictured this scenario John leaving the hotel earlier on the way to the game picturing how the game's going to go I didn't expect a great England performance but I certainly didn't expect them to be in this situation with 87 minutes on the clock chasing the game 1-0 down heading out of the Euros in the last 16 England with stones he has Palmer then Foden with a run into the box could open up here but Lebotka was in place to stab it away behind for a corner from the right well just bodies in the box England Bellingham and Kane both in a similar position in the box nobody really gets across that near post area and sure enough there's a blue shirt in there ready to deal with it and put the ball out of the box again big moments these big moments at the Euros for England have to find a goal Foden with the corner in under the crossbar Bellingham with a challenge to Brabka goes down referee's not interested headed back in by Ezzer still not out of the penalty area and then Ezzer commits a foul on the edge of the box and a free kick to the lucky yet another great header in there to really control Paul to his huge header super header wouldn't I mean they took to a man in anything in the box it's just been brilliant and the way Lebotka just wins the foul there's a tiny hand on the back from Ezzer but he drops to the floor and takes this thing out of the game there's a free kick in their own box they're taking their time they're running the clock down it'd be interesting to see what kind of added time England have to play with but this is this is scary stuff John it is 90 seconds of the 90 minutes to go commentary on Spain Georgia to come right now England would take anything they'd take expert time they'd take penalties whatever it takes but they are on the way home from Germany unless unless Kane on the halfway line Rice hit the post with a shot Kane couldn't shoot in the follow-up goes back to do Brabka to Brabka's clearance Garasagic catches it and hands it to Saka and then back to not gay gay turns and uses Saka then gay can't take my eyes off that clock there'll be five minutes just five minutes of added time they don't know that in the stadium yet Palmer still only 10 yards inside the Slovakia half Palmer takes it on himself and then Palmer's pass is blocked and Slovakia just anywhere will do volleyed away into the centre circle John Stones then heads it back to Pickford well it's been quite a story for Garas Southgate and his England team but I think it's going to come to a bit around unless they can come up with a goal it just doesn't look likely John at the moment I mean if anything Slovakia having the probably the better joy and an hour of bouncing with the ball and here they come with Schrantz on the right wing Schrantz he's the hero again as he turns and passes it out as tired six minutes it's actually six minutes that have been added on and now Kane turns on the halfway line and passes the ball actually behind Palmer that there's no one there in a blue shirt so England Palmer is able to carry it forward the England supporters thousands of them urging their team on Rice then back to gay gay again Declan Rice pulls away to the left hand side Ezra ahead of him Saka Saka forward towards a barrage at Eze who finished the season so well with Crystal Palace he turns his man Vabro then the cross into the penalty area bought by Packereak for a corner whenever a blue shirt has been beaten there's been another one that comes across and gets the job done defensively they've been brilliant as teammates for each other tonight Slovakia I mean Vabro comes out of the box there gets done by Eze and there's a recovering midfield player running all the way across to get that block in and put it out for a corner five minutes of added time to go Ezra right footed corner to the back post to Brabler comes gets a punch on it Thornton will allow it to bounce he's being forced out there by Schrantz you've got to touch on that onto Thornton minutes of throwing to Slovakia in their own left back position and it was the perfect amount of pressure from Schrantz not committing a foul but making Foden really uncomfortable and I'm looking at Garis Algate on the monitor hands in his pockets looking at the floor I think he feels what's coming John is yeah it's not looking good he knows what's coming we'll hear from him post match whatever happens throwing is taken see Slovakia are going to bring on John Bear as well no but John Bear so that'll waste a few more seconds that's their final change and we've got we are in to the point where we've got four minutes of added time to play Rice challenges for a ball inside the pang of the area but he's got his head to it and it bounces through Rice's stones it is down on his back I think he's got a bang in the face as well as he put the challenge in on that possibly the way that he fell actually caught his face on the ground yeah he lands quite awkwardly I mean his desperation isn't it John Stone's up there trying to get anything on the ball just to keep it in play and head it back in the box and that full stretch lands very awkwardly smashes his face off the turf he's back up on his feet but I mean I just can't believe we're in this situation yeah well I can relate to this it's not a nice feeling I was there in 2016 the game we're talking about and as a goalkeeper and as a player you're just hoping for one more chance one more big moment you never give up you've got to keep pushing you've got to keep believing the change final Slovak change is made and it's the goal scorer Ivan Shrance his goal is being shown on the big screens England are going to make a very late change as well Ivan Tony coming on for his first experience of the tournament and and he they'll have to wait though can't it can't happen yet so Norbert John Bear of Salerno Tana comes on into the midfield for Slovakia and we have now less than three minutes to play forward from game headed away by Vavro Forden now turns England simply not being able to find the way through and past this awkward spirited Slovakia team who are on course for Switzerland and the quarterfinals on Saturday stones Tama balanced himself well Walker though can't reach that it's just chipped out of play by Skrinyafra throwing to England down the left with just over two minutes now to go and now the change is made the final change the final throw of the dice from Gareth Southgate Ivan Tony replacing Phil Forden who is ready to take the throw the boost from the England fans I think Tony pick Tony takes up a position inside the penalty area it's going to be a long throw for England we're into the penultimate minute here comes the throw headed away for Slovakia turned back in by Rice stones was after it cleared away out of play throwing next to the corner flag Kyle Walker waiting to take it urges the ball back from someone over the hoardings there Walker again winds himself up here's the throw flat to the near post flaked on over it's one one it's that man too Balian he's come up with the magic he saved England he saved Gareth Southgate England wants Slovakia won in the final minute of added time an extra time now is on the cards what a way to do it the day after his 21st birthday who writes his scripts that's a fairy tale one one I I can't believe it what a moment that is the long throw into the box to flick on from Gehir the overhead acrobatic kick from that man Jude Bellingham to look dead on his feet he finds this from somewhere it's so accurate it's technically executed to perfection England off the hook I mean I just cannot believe we've got away with that performance in this stage of the game it's just incredible I cannot believe it John what it's just you can't write it what a moment what a moment that was incredible we're all shaking our heads putting balls into the box Slovakia gobbled them up all night great ahead of from gay heat that was incredible that was absolutely incredible what a time to do it you can see the anger you can see the frustration he's hearing people talking about him and for the first time in his career they've not been saying good things but oh my goodness me what a moment from Jude well England have provided a moment for their supporters at this euros right right at the point when it seemed they were heading out and Jude Bellingham making it England one Slovakia one with an overhead kick from what was he mad 10 yards out it flew into the net and the scenes of celebration from England this is really taking me back to Moscow but the other way around against Columbia remember the Colombians came up with the Yerimina with his equalizer to take it to extra time we're still playing we're way beyond the six minutes now after the England celebrations Harry Kane with the ball inside the each Slovakia Harvest challenged thought he might have been felled but referee Mel air allows that play to continue and there it is there's the final whistle and we've got extra time here in galsen kerkin and look at the lift Matt that this is given to England the players the England players with a spring in their step Jude Bellingham walks away pushing his chest out and raising his arms to the England bench and the supporters England one Slovakia one extra time to come Matt Upsen to your heart where do you go with your your mindset and your body language now if you're a Slovakia player you have got to drag yourself up from the floor this game was one they had done an amazing job what a performance from then and you have now got to pick yourself up for half an hour of extra time it surely swung right back into England's favor I really do I think that I think from maybe the 41st minute onwards England started having we're in the ascendancy and Slovakia but they were feeling we were discussing it you know 75% possession it's just possession but it does it takes out of your legs it takes the confidence it takes the belief and every time they were able to bring two subs substitutes on they had that little bit of energy they got two three passes together but that's been it in isolation Jordan Pickford's just been basically orchestrating from the back England have been threatening but is that their first shot on target I think that's the crazy thing I don't think there's not been a huge amount of pressure on Martin de Brabkir in terms of shots and shots raining in but the pressure was just coming and coming and yes it was first shot on target bicycle kick in the 96th minute what a moment well England's supporters England's followers wanted some excitement at this euros it came rather late England once Slovakia won an extra time to follow well they haven't been happy behind you have the easy christiansome but they are now do you know what I cannot stop laughing because I have just seen firsthand what the word limbs means oh my word the fans behind me have gone absolutely nuts they've taken their tops off they're swinging them around their heads every single one well most of them have got their tops off they the atmosphere is just incredible the noise is deafening and my word has it swung back into England's favour I mean I think and we were talking about it Joe during the commentary I think that might be the only header that Slovakia didn't win in their box for the whole of the 96 minutes yeah it seemed it didn't seem like the right play but desperation there was absolute desperation John Stones was playing up front at one point there was pure desperation and then there was that guy Jude Bellingham Harry Kane's not that kind of guy but he was next to him doing the Jude Bellingham celebration in this stadium that's what's happened that's the feeling in the place huge lift huge pressure on Slovakia now and England have got to press home this advantage they will now won't they going into extra time is he and just looking at sort of the contrast really of the two groups of players there are a few Slovakians on the floor getting robbed England with the exception of John Stones and maybe Jude Bellingham are all standing up yeah it's the contrast of elite sport isn't it it can swing in the matter of a split second and the Slovakian team the way that they have defended in this game the structure has been exceptional and I can't help but think they are going to be absolutely knackered now what have they got in their tank and in that England huddle they've got to be wary of the Slovakian threat because on the ball they've shown real glimpses of quality they can break through England but come on it's all about England now they've got to take this and they've got to swing it back well Matt is is he talks about the Slovakian structure the England structure will be interesting in this in this 30 minutes when they're burning mine just before that throwing Foden came off and Tony came on so how they balance this will be interesting well Ivan Tony thought he was going to get one minute of Euro's action is now going to get a hugely important 30 minutes of extra time and you're right that the balance of the team I mean I you lose count of where people are playing and what they're doing at that at that stage in the game is desperation you just throwing people on to see if they can have an impact now England have to settle they have to get a bit of a rhythm and an understanding of who's doing what and what role each player is playing but the main thing is we're hanging in there and we've got an opportunity and that's the only thing that matters right now so be a very very interesting first 15 minutes of extra time just to see the body language and the energy of the two respective teams John Murray well garrison gate and steve holland in discussions on the side of the page so far they've made three substitutions so main who called and and trippie have been taken off so I presume they're talking about exactly what we've been discussing in the balance of the team yeah well yeah just how they're lining up I mean Ivan Tony's out here on the right halfway line sacks is behind him yeah so whether or not it's going to be Eze possibly I mean it's hard to see until the ball they're not really set yet once they get into shape and position we'll have a look but garrison's walker right back whether or not it's going to be a three oh the flick by Tony into the penalty area England kicking off at the start of this period of extra time the first extra time of euro 2024 in England involved in it against world number 45 ranked Slovakia who took England all the way before jude bellingham came up with that equalizer in the fifth minute of added time and Tony has won a free kick for England on the right England now attacking towards their jubilant supporters they almost couldn't believe their eyes I think probably most of them had given it up thought it wasn't going to come thought England were going home with bellingham saved them now Palmer takes the free kick into Brabka comes free gets a punch as it with a shot miss hit across the goal from it and Kane is there! England scored right at the start of extra time from one mil down and almost out now and right at the start of extra time Harry Kane with a close range header and a cheaply two Slovakia won who won it how things can change at the drop of a hat in this game it's crazy absolutely crazy but you just felt England were going to come into this extra time with the positive edge with that ascendancy and they've capitalised on it straight away in extra time it's two players I mean Ivan Tony does brilliantly it's a skewed hit from SA with his right foot he shanks the effort on the edge of the box but the header from Tony it bounces off the floor and he just flicks it right back into the danger area Slovakia have players really deep and it's pretty simple for Harry Kane just to get off the ground and punch the header into an open net the Brabka is all the way across the other side of the goal but Ivan Tony does superbly well with his header just to guide it back into the danger area and have him right in front of his Christianson in front of that goal oh well well well how about turning it around Harry Kane that man he's had so much criticism but what a finish he couldn't really miss could he in the celebration say everything and that man Ivan Tony as well having a say in it you couldn't write it could you Harry Kane that makes it a record extending eight goals for him in knockout matches that either the World Cup or the European Championship 14 goals in total at World Cups and European Championship finals tournaments and Harry Kane was there where it mattered and it looks very very different for England now who are two one up on a on a very tired Slovakia however they attack down the right hand side great noise now swirling around this stadium what a moment that was for England Dalligan scoring in the fifth minute of added time Harry Kane in the first minute of extra time would you say the mood's changed a little bit slightly marginally slightly almost interceptively here so what do England do now guys they've got the lead the dominate in the game Slovakia tired all played across from the left hand side into the penalty area I would suggest you they've got to keep it tight at the back I think nothing different no I agree that's nothing different if you if you start to picture now hanging on to something all of a sudden you wind up on the edge of your own box yeah you know you've almost got to stay in that mindset that you're still drawing the game and you need to just play in that that fashion you know a lot was made after the knockout stages of the competition by those who could remember it that the England's group record was exactly like atalia 19 and at that tournament things really sparked for England in the round of 16 when David Platt scored a goal right at the end of extra time to take England through against Belgium and then after that what a roller coaster against Cameroon in the quarterfinal is that the over the shoulder volley it was what oh that was gas coins free kick so the similarities to 1990 continue England we thought they were out now they're in a position where they'd be heading through there's a high foot there from Harry Kane I think it was which is uh which is called scrinny R and it's a free kick to Slovakia just outside the penalty area Kane looking like put a wooden belt in his mouth Harry Kane who's just scored his 65th goal for England I did you know to suggest that Harry Kane should be left out of this team when when Kane has actually now scored 14 goals in his last 17 England appearances that's pretty impressive isn't it I mean there's no doubting what he has brought whether or not for me his look that is fittest and sharpest in this tournament I don't think he is and I think he's been struggling a little bit with injury and what have you I don't think he's he's right at his best but if you want anyone in a situation where you need a goal and they've got to finish something statistically you know he's hard hard to match isn't he and you want him in that position to take the chance when it comes and he's he's done that today so on a sunday evening now England lead Slovakia by two goals to one in extra time we've got commentary coming from Cologne from Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton on Spain Georgia which uh that could be a thriller as well we'll see that this has provided some moments for us I mean we've got we've got Eze left back at the moment haven't we yeah that's right I mean it just it seems to be changing all the time but Rice is still sat in front of the back four yeah looks like Eze left back with Bellingham and Palmer in the middle of the pitch Tony and Kane kind of as a two up front with Kane dropping just behind a little bit and it's now about keeping good high pressure it's kind of a back three isn't it yeah with gay and stones and Walker and Sacher on the right Sacher is the right wing back so we've seen all sorts of things that we didn't expect to see here today as Slovakia are attacked with hands go he's been one of their bright lights Slovakia it looks as though I mean that must have just taken so much out of them for England to score those two goals in the way that they did so credit to them if they're able to recover from base and come again which is what they're trying to do now with the ball just outside the area with Benish now to the left hand side to Susloff Susloff's ball into the penalty area but Rice takes charge and runs it away and uh and Rice then on his left foot is able to clear away up towards Tony England playing with Tony and Kane up front we weren't expecting that we weren't expecting return to three central defenders we weren't expecting Ezi at left wing back no but I certainly expect to see what Tony did there that is what he brings to the team uses his body superbly well just backs in it's got that big frame really backs into the center back doesn't allow him a clean run to go and attack the ball and he buys and wins that foul takes the contact and just allows England to settle a little bit get up the pitch slow the pace of the game down and take control you just want to see some control possession at the moment and just keep the ball a little bit well we're midway through the first period of extra time so there's still quite a long way to go before England can celebrate a place in the quarterfinals and at 2-1 of course it is finally poised Ezi now here is Bellingham he's enhanced his reputation he's built his reputation Ezi runs away from the challenge from Boznik now Walker Walker to Saka Saka looking for the passing field towards Harry Kane Kane turns tries to play one of those Kane passes shoulders hunched left footed out to the far side he's looking for Tony but it was intercepted by Pecorico still on the field incidentally the 37 year old he's still going he's still going here's Sprinniar the Slovakia captain from a point where for England supporters about 10 minutes ago 15 minutes ago it seemed that the clock was whizzing around now for them it seems as though it's slowed almost to stopping point those uh Fabro it's a long pass gaze underneath that for for England now Declan Rice Eza then back towards the edge of the penalty area and all the way back to to goalkeeper Tickford if you've just switched on if you've been out at about on a Sunday and haven't heard what a dramatic afternoon we've had here in Gelsenkirk in England 1-0 down the early goal from Ivan Trance in the first half right deep into added time when Jude Bellingham with an overhead kick made it 1-1 to take it into expert time and then right at the start of expert time after a free kick on the right a shot from Eza Ivan Tony managed to work it across the penalty area and Harry Kane in the middle from first range headed into the back of the Slovak net so 2-1 it is to England Eza heading the ball away so that you're trying to put pressure on England now Fabro Fabro through to LeBotte Cat LeBotte catches outside the box LeBotte Cat turns plays it back you know a lot of time there Joe didn't LeBotte because there was nothing in front of him so he couldn't find the pass but he had a lot of time to turn on the edge of the box screen yard Slovakia fighting their feet again in the game the ball comes in Tickford comes and is able to tap it down up and across from Hansquon the left hand side and drops down onto his knees a bit like he does in those Everton games Joe where Tickford will catch it drop down flat on his face to wind up the Liverpool fans yeah um yeah that's how he likes to play the game that's what he does obviously it's important now to I don't I don't want us to just wind the clock down I think I think another goal completely kills the game but obviously I understand there's a lot go a lot on the line here but another goal completely kills this and Slovakia they've come back into the game ironically when they're 2-1 down of course but us just dropping off just allowing them in when they were absolutely crushed yeah they could make another change an extra time actually Conagalliga is getting ready so uh England going to just alter things with the 2-1 lead as uh as you said Matt with Tony and Kane up front interesting to see who Conagalliga comes on for here stones with the ball on the edge of his penalty area turns it forward as Joe said Joe Hart suggested there that England don't want to go all safety first and cautious again do they oh absolutely not I just think you you've got a picture it's still as being level and you play with it in that kind of manner it's progressive okay you want to have control possession but you want to do it in the right area the pitch not in your own 18 yard box necessarily and just get yourself up the pitch into their territory long pass forward from walk up long long downfield and it's headed back to uh to Gorky by Dubravka by Jumper Dubravka gets it down you know we did speculate didn't we about whether Jude Pellingham was going to be able to continue in the game he did well justified leaving him on doesn't he you can you can doubt that you can't doubt that I mean it must have been easy to look looking at him thinking and need to switch him because he looks really tired but Gareth Southgate making exactly the right call there to leave him on to produce something like that that's just look out on his feet again no doesn't he just watching him now as Slavakir attacked down the right hand side the ball is kept in look as though it's going to go out for throwing Susalop against Bukhayo Saka the right the right wing back as he is now throwing taken with Benesh and then Benesh gets it back the number 11 comes back to Skrinjar and Slavakir are actually building the pressure on England here 12 minutes played in the first period of extra time again Benesh who has looked bright since he came on to the field as this the number of the Slavak substitutes who have refreshed them Skrinjar on his right foot Skrinjar goes for the angle ball Pickford comes a long way and makes that catch that was very positive from Jordan Pickford and actually I think the flag's off the flag is up as well yeah I mean he had a long time to judge that ball it was floated in across diagonally across the box and he comes and trains it really nicely takes a bit of a bump rolls around on the floor a little bit now having a chat with a referee I mean yeah he knows what he's doing John in terms of running this clock down you've got a rice smile on your face Joe yeah he comes into his own here doesn't he yeah he kicks in doesn't he it does it really does kick in uh yeah fair play to him to one England League five live and the World Service it'll almost be straight into Spain Georgia after this then field it goes Walker trying to to keep up with Susloff and then the ball through the middle as over the challenge that might be a free kick no referee's not giving it for as a challenge an England break away with Palmer Palmer now Palmer is might have been fouled no he's kept his feet against Susloff there's only Tony in the middle Palmer cuts into the box Leopard and ball headed back to him Saka's in there Saka goes down England fans shout for a penalty but I don't think they had anything of a case there and Slavakir Airol to survive that is having in wins a throw a concede to throw in on the far side it's not even close to a penalty with Saka I know it England fans are going to appeal for that at this stage in the game but just opened up a little bit there for Slavakir a little bit fortunate as they does well actually gets himself back in position yes there's contact with the player but he's gold siding and he makes a really good run back into that hole Slavakir come again Palmer wins the ball but fouls his man and it's a free kick and we are now in the last minute of the first period of extra time here it's like he toes the ball away cleanly there Palmer I don't really see the offense there but maybe there's a slight contact on Slavakir and players foot before he wins the ball yeah Susloff free kick taken Slavakir back towards the halfway line it goes it's controlled there and played forward towards the left hand side Susloff slips the ball that's a nice ball into the penalty area then back and the across goal it goes and with the arriving Peckery at the back post the offside flag I think was up but Peckery lifted it over the bar what a warning for England it's over the bar whether it is I don't think it is offside it doesn't look offside he kind of comes from behind Eze but he knows how big a chance it is the 37 year old right back to get that high up at the pitch I mean we're just marveling the fact he's on the pitch John let alone flying up the wing and also that was one of the moves of the match yeah it was brilliant look like say the pass in to the centre forward who makes that little diagonal run into the corner of the 18 yard but sets the ball back for the cross and he's very nearly there just to bang that into the back post it was a good foot over the crossbar but any kind of different contact is in the back of the net one minute of added time at the end of this first period of extra time and the score remains England 2 Slovakia 1 Jordan Teckford with the ball just walks it out towards the edge of the penalty area referee says come on get rid of it which he does clearance downfield Kane the challenge for it have roll wins the header comes to Tony Tony involved in the goal for England that turned it around here a sacker now against Hans go ball into Palmer inside the penalty area Palmer keeps his feet and then plays it back to Rice Rice to his left to Ezzar and now Tony gives it away and there is the whistle for the end of the first period of extra time so England 15 minutes away now from a place in the quarter finals when at one stage right at the end of the 19 minutes and more there were seconds from going out half time in extra time England 2 Slovakia 1 still got to be careful haven't they Matt Oaksson absolutely just saw that Chappers really carved a lovely opportunity they've played some good football Slovakia make no mistake they're not just a team that wants to work hard off the ball when they've had it they put some really nice combinations together have they played the better combinations I know it seems slightly cheerlish to say that with England 2 on up but it do you think they have yes I think they've been slicker with their passing when they've had it and they've had those moments it's been one and two touch I mean the bot has been at the heart of a lot of it in terms of starting it nice angled runs the energy they've had to run and they've got wide players Chappers that will stay in that channel try and get in behind the defence and they've done it on several occasions and creating opportunities just like that one and to have the right back in that position at that stage of the game they've put some heart into this game I mean I really do feel for the position they're in they've been absolutely superb Izzy has had Consra and Gallagher waiting for a while to come on I wonder whether they will be the changes at this half time in extra time just to solidify it in a couple of areas definitely absolutely and I think our Southgate got them ready and then hung fire a little bit because I think he thought okay the team's in a good place right now wait until half time of extra time or maybe into the second period just to kind of delay it as well yeah just to delay it as a way to the ages before yeah yeah just to delay it a little bit but I think it makes a lot of sense to solidify things but it's incredible you know when they go 2 on up England the energy that I've seen from Jude Bellingham I know Matt and the guys up there have been saying that he looks tired and he is but he has found something deep within him and he's been running he has been running after things he shouldn't be running after in extra time let me tell you that so just trying to look at who's to be off and it looks like 9 and 10 John Murray yes it does Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham so on come Gallagher and Consra as well as we con that who we've heard the Aston Bellaman the number 14 has been doing very well in training has impressed caught the eye but Garas Southgate with 15 minutes to go there's still the possibility of penalties to come takes off two of his potential penalty takers yeah he does but I think he's he's making that judgment to say well I need to bring them off they're tired we also got to be picturing the fact that we could have a big game to come in a few days time and just want to shore things up I mean it's it's a tough game to come on out for someone like consa in a defensive role you know you've really got to have your wits about you you're only really potentially going to make a mistake or something crazy you know what I mean you're not going to send a forward coming on to win the game like Tony comes on so it's all about mentality and having that belief and he's very calm very assured he's been training well from what what I hear so for him to come on and have the his experience is brilliant as a defender but you do have to feel that you know there's a lot on it and you have to make good decisions and be really positive just adds to the nervousness of this afternoon job yeah I don't I don't think this is going to be a 15 16 minutes that we cruise I really don't it's just been the way that we've played this tournament and it's it's not exactly easy on the eye but the team need to find a way they really need to find a way and you know consa and Gallagher have got a huge part to play here and now it's consa mad at left back well yeah I mean he still looks a little bit of a back five almost I mean sack has dropped so deep on that right hand side I mean he's out just outside of Karl Walker so as your eyes look at it now it's a five but you'd think it would be a back four with consa at left back so back here coming forward the ball ricochets into the penalty area and Jordan Pickford's able to move across to his left after it came off John Stones and prevent the ball from going out for a corner so already into the second minute of the second period of extra time Slovakia have got one more change and they're going to bring on a forward Lubomir Tupta once the ball goes out of play that'll be their sixth and final change to one England lead and Tony loses out in the centre circle here is Peckery and then Vavro Vavro to Lobotka and Lobotka is able to cross the halfway line a little mobile figure that he is passes the ball through the middle to Buzheny but it breaks down and Tony is able to carry it forward then played back to Cona Gallagher Gallagher then back to Kyle Walker and out to Bukajosaka who's been put under pressure by Slovakia who seem to have found their press again don't they there's energetic press of theirs Mark Gaye now across to Esri Konza and then back to Gaye again on the edge of the box. Pickford takes it on to his right foot but uses his left to pass it across the penalty area where John Stones languidly passes it forward comes back to Slovakia then it's blocked back into the path of Suzlov but Gallagher I suppose that this is why Gallagher's come on for his energy in the latter period of extra time Gallagher again chasing the ball rice dives in with a challenge excellent from him and then Ezzar the baritie Ezzar is able to carry the ball forward downfield beats Longman oh and then is taken out by Vavro and the referee couldn't get his yellow card out of his puppy quickly enough for Dennis Vavro. Well we actually heard that up here it was some clatter from Vavro really just stepping with his hip and his shoulder as Ezzar just nudges the ball past him and runs into him I mean it's somebody checking so much the fact that Ezz is still laying on the floor he's not got up yet. The change is made and it is now Petter Pekareek who has been substituted what a shift from him to the 30s of a year old. Yeah I mean he had his very happy name day yesterday didn't he? He did yes he was able to celebrate that. He was and he's had a good day today I mean his performance you can't really pick any holes in any of their performances for Slovakia. Tupter has gone into sort of left wing position Lubomir Tupter of Slovan Liberets. What a battle this has been for England. Talk about lacking energy they've had to use every drop of energy here free kick taken by Gay. Three minutes almost four of this second period of extra time Slovakia come forward but Bero has to turn give it back in field to Lobotka Lobotka now looking forward with his pass as Income 2 England men. Rice is in there that's given as a free kick Gallagher and I think it was rice with the challenge and the free kick is free kick is won by Slovakia through the middle after Gallagher didn't quite get there and actually took down Tupter. Yeah it's a little bit unfortunate the ball just kind of ricochets it drops loose the other side of Gallagher he puts his right leg really outstretched just to win the ball back in and he makes contact and it's a it's a it's a funny distance this it's just one of those distances John that if you've got a player in the team that can hit the ball flat and just that dipping shot just go gets over the wall and bouncing with pace in front the goalkeeper can be really difficult. Tupter likes to look at this yeah and Jordan Pickford just leaning against his left post lining up the wall you do wonder it's been one of those tournament games whether there might be yet another twist in it. Tupter with his right foot from this free kick becomes chips ago with that Pickford was comfortable there and actually jumps up and hangs off the crossbar as it flies over by a couple of yards to the cheers of the England fans behind where is he Christensen is standing and he is a goal kick. Yeah he tries to hit exactly that shot that kind of Ronaldo-esque dipping flat hit with the boot where it just goes over and moves about in front of the goalkeeper but he just can't keep it down too much height on it and he just blazes over the bar. Ten minutes to go England 2 Slovakia 1 you're listening to us on the World Service and on Five Live tomorrow morning we've got more county championship cricket on the BBC Wimbledon begins tomorrow two more commentaries but what drama we've had here in Gelsenkirchen as England try to see this out for what would be only their second win of the tournament when it seemed almost gone for them. As Ivan Tony ball is presented to him hope that was a foul by Gallagher it is they complain about it but it was just a little over exuberant into the challenge and England are now in danger of just sitting on it free kick to be taken by Benish and so up they go. Benish takes this left footed headed away by Eza somebody's thrown a ball back onto the pitch so we've got two balls on the pitch so that's sliced away over the hoardings throwing for Babro and actually the ball's thrown back on by the England fans. Still on the pitch. Still on the pitch when he popped off the advertising hoardings and come back in England fans enjoying that one. I hope that wasn't Izzy throwing that back onto the field it's down to her end. Throwing is taken here's the cross that's blocked on the edge of the six-yard box by Konza out of play for another throw England are coming under pressure here it's not over yet long throw by Barrow here it is into the penalty area rice gets up couldn't reach it bounces down rice clears it on the turn only though back to Barrow his cross into the back post is cleared away by Walker oh just over the head just over the head of Hanscoe. Slovakia come again suddenly they're taking great encouragement from this Suzlov on his left foot and it goes into the penalty area and it's allowed to bounce all the way through and Kyle Walker is is enveloped by a Jordan Pickford hook for allowing that through for goal kick. Well Hanscoe was an intro way from making this game level there any kind of contact on that delivery it was a lovely left foot in swinging delivery into the box and he jumps it's going through loads of bodies and he just can't get any contact must have grazed the hair on his head but any touch would have been big trouble for England. Pickford with the free kick some England fans begin twirling their shirts above their heads on this actually by recent standards comparatively cool evening still shirt sleeve weather Tony concede to free kick and so Barrow again to the right hand side to Barrow Barrow's ball in to the edge of the box John Stones comes across is able to carefully head that away to Declan Rice who controls it and now called Tarma with his balance keeps possession there's a little wiggle of his hips there as well from the Chelsea man and then it's back towards the edge of the penalty area John Stones out to Kyle Walker on the far side Walker is able to keep possession plays the factor Stones long pass from him to the halfway line to Tony who's been fouled he's been shoved over by Jim Bear and actually as a yellow card I think for the protest as much as anything else and it's a chance for England to take a few moments or that there's Tony stayed on the ground yeah John Bear hasn't managed to get to grips with Ivan Tony who's done his job since coming on he's done very well he's just used his body so any long ball that gets cleared up the pitch he's backing in he's making life difficult for the centre back he's drawing fouls he even gets a book in there and he wins a free kick and an important time for England we were looking a little bit shaky a little bit defensive sat on the edge of our own 18-yard box we're now able to get all the way up the pitch if you're on the way home the highlights of this are on later tonight 1045 BBC 2 or on the iPlayer and as I say via Stones if you want to you can listen back to this commentary it's a roller coaster 2-1 England League as a free kick has hit four as a as or is able to take it down into the full back position but Slovakia were able to to win it back and rice herring after the ball the effort that he's put into this game Deflan Rice LeBotka again he's the big hope for Slovakia it's a long pass towards the edge of the penalty area where it's carried out towards the far side and back it goes to LeBotka once more England drop back white shirts behind the ball Fabro now again to the right hand side to Beiro Fabro on the right wing the central defender and that's blocked behind by gay for a corner which are looping to take quickly this is their first corner of the match Slovakia they've been on top the last five minutes England have to be careful here's another ball flying into the box and you can bet there's going to be a blue shirt flying towards the ball they're so committed in these situations some big man finished to take there's no other referees not ready so Jordan Pickford steps out of his six yard box and and just not sure who he was shouting at there but Benesh will come again to take this corner from the right hand side England need to stand up strong here could take it short Benesh with the the left foot delivery into the edge of the six yard area Ivan Tony was there to head it away for England and then Ezzar the folly's it downfield goalkeeper to Bravka races out of his penalty area to control this we've got four minutes of added time four minutes of extra time to play and Slovakia attacking through the middle bounces back to the centre circle to Fabro now towards the left hand side LeBotka Slovakia dominating possession now England have dropped right off them Fabro takes it on forward passes it to the right hand side Suzlov is there his crosses blocked out of play to throw into Slovakia down the right by the way that Spain Georgia game is going to start on sports extra so we can hear from the England camp and react to this game two balls on the pitch one's been knocked off the pitch and then the shot from the angle by Bozhenik into the side netting and it is a goal kick to England that's up some of it interesting if that had gone in the back of the net because there were two balls there were two balls so technically the game probably should have stopped the referee allowed play on ridiculous angle to try and score from you're never going to be able to beat the goalkeeper from from that kind of tight angle Joe Hart it feels like England are kind of in Normans land here at the moment yeah they are you know they've been guilty of that every time they've taken the lead in this tournament but it feels like it's a moment where they just need to get over the line and then and deal with the deal with whatever falls out from it after but yeah it's been it's such a shame when you see them being so dominant I understand Slovakia was sitting in trying to hang on to the result but this team can dominate when it's in the right mood but the moment they take the lead they're just so cautious it's amazing the psychology behind after the goals isn't it to be so dominant and let's say to score that second was two one you know Slovakia are crushed at that moment and to then have that psychology to then not keep taking the game there and you end up in this situation where you're now hanging on the edge of your own 18-yard box and defending to to win the game and that's what they're doing two minutes to see this out two minutes to see it out for a place in the quarter finals but it is Slovakia in possession Conigalega hairs after the ball Lebotka has got it then it comes in field towards the captain Skriniar then back from Skriniar to Lebotka one two three four five six Slovakia players near the edge of the England penalty area as I look down here Skriniar again Skriniar finds the pass to the right hand side to Barrow Barrow slips it past Konza now Suslov on the right hand side Suslov then back for the ball in from the right and it is headed up in the air but wide and Kyle Walker did his best there to put the challenge in and make sure that that was not a clean header on goal and it bounced wide at the far post for a goal kick to England from the head of Hancock. You need to be ready when that ball is wide they've got one thing in their mind it's coming in the ball is getting delivered into the box and there's blue shirts arriving so defending that 18-yard box for England when the ball is wide is so key can we hang on and just see this game through. What an effort from Slovakia I think we're going to have to feel a little for them absolutely with that they've played here today that is to be defeated and exit at the round of 16 again for them that England they are now seconds away I make it we've got 40 seconds to go England equalised almost right at the end of normal time now Slovakia with Lebotka they know time's almost up for them the pass through the middle Tony puts his foot in here's Vabro Suslov again on the right Suslov against Konza left footed ball into the box headed away Walker got a good header in on that still inside the penalty area and then away it is by Konza and it calls it the feet of Tony and England could run away now and break away with Parma they do Slovakia have only got one man back Tony and Eze Parma tries to find Eze bounces to Tony Tony blasts it over from the edge of the penalty area that would have finished it Tony slats on his back waiting to add a time now there's one minute of added time before England are through to the quarterfinals. When he goes for power here Tony the ball just falls to him he has a touch on his right foot if he hits the target it's in because he's hit it with so much power but just blazes it about a yard over the crossbar. 30 seconds to go England lead 2-1 England who are almost out Slovakia have to come forward their coach Calzona is urging them on he's almost on the pitch Suslov now on the right hand side Suslov as Slovakia looked for the goal that would take it to penalties right foot cross that was excellent it's headed down Pickford dives to his right and is able to gather the ball and fall flat on his face and hold on to it Harry Kane's there on the edge of the coaching area Pickford gets up he twirls his fist that orange glove to the England fans I think he thinks that that is it and the referee says that is it and England have come through it and Garrard Southgate and Steve Holland hook one another and all of his coaches now in an embrace what an emotional effort this has been England players are down on the pitch Slovakia are out what an effort from them they were so close to going through I think a yellow card's been shown down there on the pitch as well whether that was Suslov and actually the the coach Calzona is having words with Declan Rice and I think Calzona pushed away Declan Rice and now Tempazart off-reying there and the Slovakia coaches is right in the middle of this and players generally milling around but what an effort that is from England it looks as though the story was coming to an end for Garrard Southgate as England manager for his team at this tournament and somehow Jude Valingham an incredible unforgettable overhead kick and then Harry Kane with a header right at the start of extra time and England have won two-one and England are through into the quarterfinals for a fourth time in four tournaments under Garrard Southgate it'll be England Switzerland on Saturday Manipsen, Johard, shoot England only Garrard Southgate only gets to the set of the quarterfinals minimum jump and that's happened again today how it's happened I don't quite know to be honest it's just been the most bizarre game you have to take a step back and look at how bad England have played in moments in this game and how Slovakia must feel I can see why Francisco Calzona is frustrated and airing that frustration because he thinks they're calm down now they have but his team were just absolutely superb he's congratulating them in the middle of the centre circle and rightly so they gave everything they were excellent they were better than us in certain moments and throughout a lot of the game they had a structure they had a plan they pressed they worked they played when they got the ball and England have just hung on and got through it just watching Garrard Southgate just to see what he does now he's in a big embrace with Jude Valingham and I'm not surprised after what Valingham's done for him today yeah that was a big moment and obviously he's put a lot of a lot of trust in him I'm just thinking there Matt you said I don't know how to explain what's gone on there because I expect my the hairs and the back of my neck to be stood up but they're not I don't know I'm aware of what happened in the game and yeah they were they were yeah I don't really know what to say do you feel flat I do yeah I think I feel like I should be absolutely buzzing and don't get me wrong that the crowd's getting behind it and sweet Caroline's playing but it's going to have to be a huge improvement for us to get anything out of the game on Saturday that's all that's running through my mind well listen there will be a 100th match for Garrard Southgate as the England manager it'll be the quarterfinal on Saturday after it finished here England 2 Slovakia 1 after extra time Mark Chapman well England have some England have provided some drama finally but first of all Joe welcome to the last 20 years I'm sitting here judging but I've just more trouble than these guys I've trust me just trying to work out what we've what we've seen and trying to find a bit out what you would say is he and maybe the big this is the biggest thing that might change after tonight the energy is different yeah now what's more interesting now is Southgate's on his own in front of the England fans so he'll be interested to see what the response is here it's more positive yeah I mean the fans are just they just want to win and for me there's enough in that performance there I completely agree with Joe you know the performance on the whole Slovakia were the better team you know in and out of possession but there were moments in that game where I think you can cling on to that and you can take that forward and massive massive moment from Jude Bellingham it must have been about 30 seconds left on the clock and he's done a bicycle kick to equalize to take it to extra time and then Harry Kane two set pieces two goals and the set pieces have been awful this tournament so far from England but I think there's enough in that there's character we said before the game the players were going to have to dig deep and they were the pilots they were the ones who were going to have to sort this out and some big players have stepped up in big moments when their countries needed them so they've got to capture that move forward. So for Garos Southgate now that's his 13th win at a World Cup or a European Championship that's a record for an England manager and he's now won seven knockout matches which is a record for an England manager. There are more games at tournaments and in between 1966 and 2016 that's a lot of tournaments and a lot of matches England won six knockout matches but there are more games at tournaments. There are more games at tournaments but in in a period of well half a century they weren't able to win as many as that. Look you've done all of the you've done all of the England games here do you think there's a change in energy? Just from just from because they weren't look for the majority of that game those England fans have not been happy and they haven't. We know how sport works and how psychology works and you know I referred back to 1990 when England were as flat as a pancake under Bobby Robson got a very hard labour dramatic win against Belgium and it changed the mood. Yeah up against another very organised team in the next round in the court finals with that little bit more quality you know we've been praising Slovakia today and they did they did they played out of their skins but they'd never overly threatened us did they there was a few chances but Switzerland yeah let's see. It's not ideal I don't want to rely on that. Yeah you don't you don't want to have to sit here and rely on things oh my god is anyone going to turn up and produce something like what we've just seen there is is it's a bit crazy isn't it it's ridiculous you want you want it to be set you want it to be organised you want it to be fluid and happening and bang that's how you win but even a winning match is in this fashion so the crowd behind the goal is drama and they're out probably go home happy. And that's what I find fascinating in all of this because right at the death they've come back they aren't going out everybody is absolutely bouncing from the messages I'm getting from back home people are bouncing back home because they've gone from going out to going through in the space of five or six minutes. What what's interesting I think is how they reflect on that yeah and how everybody else in the cold like a day will reflect on that I thought I said to you after the last group game I'm a bit confused here about how we sort of analyse all of this and now as you've said John I'm even I'm even more confused you know really it's like job done through. But surely there has to be a performance in this England team there has to be a performance and the more games you play it would follow the more chance that there will be that performance. The beauty about this sport is that a good team will beat a team of good players. That's brilliant that's why we love it that's why we watch games like this today and credit to to Slovakia was just to a man was just brilliant and they were better they performed better than us miles better than us today for what they're capable of and that's why the sport's so great so that will always out trump great individuals there's no that history will tell you that but you can win football matches in the way that we're doing because we're doing it right now whether or not we'll be a better team who plays to their maximum that's a different question and that's going to be the next challenge on Saturday and if you're in that England camp Joe now and if you're Garasavka you go that's that's you get out of jail that should get out of jail now sees that moment. Yeah I think so because there would have been moments obviously with the way that things have gone in the group stages and the feeling and the reflections you know as much as they say they won't see it they'll they'll have felt it there would have been a feeling and I felt that feeling and I've actually gone the other way and followed through with it that oh my goodness me we're going to go out here I mean this is going to cause an awful lot of trouble an awful lot of trouble it's not a nice feeling it's a helpless feeling and then that huge moment that Jude Bellingham moment I'm so pleased that you've just said chappers there that people are happy at home I want I want English fans to be happy I want them to be feeling I want them to be rejoicing I want the you know I want sweet Caroline being belted out but the team will yeah let's cash the get out of jail free card and let's go let's build on it let's get behind them and let's see what happens people are happy because they've been entertaining you can't deny that was an entertaining game of football I mean we're emotions are all over the place and you come away and you're you're you're quite thrilled about it but I don't think you can change what this is now we're too far you can't change what these performances are it's not that simple if we were to be told that England have won this tournament I think the only way they're gonna we're gonna win it is by exactly what's just happened there incredible moments moments of madness individuals turn up and produce individual bit of brilliance mistakes it doesn't feel like it's gonna be one from a free flow but as I keep saying that you know Italy Portugal the previous two winners when they were not setting this tournament alive",
