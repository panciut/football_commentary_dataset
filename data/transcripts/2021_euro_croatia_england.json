  "transcript": " So finally England embark upon Euro 2020 slightly later than advertised but with the delay has come an increase in expectation now the waiting is over with the hope that inside the next month the longest most interminable weight of all might also end in glory underneath that white Wembley arch. As it starts you can afford yourself that hope irrespective of how battle-scarred you've been by the crushing conclusions of previous reveries allowing yourself to be imbued with that dose of optimism daring to dream that this time this time that narrative will be supplemented by the ending that we all crave because close your eyes and these are the games these tournament matches are the ones that end up indebtably etched on your memory engraved on your soul these are the games that have that unparalleled power to captivate the draw you in and toy with your emotions where split-second decisions become permanent reference points these are the games you don't forget for better or worse where snapshot images are born, reputations formed and heroes made and now the next chapter in England's tale is about to be written where those clad in white craft their own story and conjure up the moments that will be remembered frame by agonizing or glorious frame for decades that three Lions journey starts here sit back and let the history unfold England have pick-filling goal Walkestones, Mings and Shipia, Raeson Phillips, Foden, Mountain Sterling and Harry Kane, Troesha, Lvivakovich, Vasaliko, Vida, Chaletsisar and Kvadiol, Brozovic, Rebic, Modric, Kovacic and Paracic and Kramerich, Danieli Olsato from Italy is the referee vastly experienced and before kickoff the England players take the knee their message still lost on a few how sweet that roar of expectation that greets the very first kick of England fans back in Wembley the scene of the history making and the heartbreaking but which will it be this time Gareth has his 2020 vision but can it come to fruition in 2021 yeah it'd be really important that we get off to a decent start get get those nerves to put to one side if we possibly can and make sure we can get an ascendancy in the game England in all whites are defending the end away to our right-hand side and Raeson Sterling has the ball this week play back for Kieran and now to Tyrone Mings takes a couple of touches and hits a comfortable confident pass to John Stones to his right back out the car Walker back for Jordan Pickford in all yellow today Pickford has only conceded four goals in his last nine games for England and he clears this one left footed a high ball for Harry Gaines trying to isolate himself against the blonde-haired familiar figure of Domagoy Vita at the heart of the Croatian defense Croatia win the second ball Trippie went down hurt thought that he should have had a free kick got back to his feet play went on and Declan Rice can mop up and find Calvin Phillips who will just work it back for stones an hour towards Carl Walker again Walker playing it for down the England right for the newly blonde Phil Foden who just loses possession Rosovic gives him a little shove in the midfield after the ball had been played forward England can lock up comfortably again in the right back position it's been decent steady early possession with a couple of minutes gone at nil-nil on Torxburg I hope I'm wrong Jim but people suggest him beforehand this isn't the Croatia of a couple of years ago I think this will be a very stern test when you can see consider the complexity is of a first game in a major tournament like we're going into now the nerves of that and it will be important that we do get off to a decent start maybe turn the opposition round on occasion as well not playing front of them so readily such as for me just a little fear of the ball and this is first match in a major tournament as it is for Mason Mount who's in possession now way forward into the feet of Raheem Sterling his control is neat and tidy trying to turn away from Rosovic the midfield enforcer for Croatia in the lay back for stones now for the Walser Walker midway inside Croatian territory Sterling drifting over to inside right for a moment Foden leaves the ball but the whistle is gone as the free giver should be taken by Croatia as a foul on the perisic over on the fire touch line and Croatia have the opportunity just to regroup England coming into this on the back of six straight wins their best run since the one seventh in a row back in the 2014-15 season but as has been well documented England do not have a good record in the opening game of this tournament nine played haven't won any of them five draws and four defeats Croatia on the other hand unbeaten in their opening game of the year owes winning all but one they're in possession now with the 19 year old Vardio who becomes the first team major to play for Croatia in a major tournament he's laid it back for Charity Sa the Marseys had a half from him to Vida that walks the right back to Salico he's just lost possession just worried about where the ball is gonna go next and laid it off and Raheem Sterling was in there to win it but Luca Modric quickly won it back he can play it for now for Kovacic who will drive forward towards the edge of the penalty area perisic's the outboard of his left hand side in the sunshine of north London still on the fire touch line perisic's coming back finding Modric perisic with an opportunity to try and take on Karl Walker he checks against it on to his right foot still can't deliver defending good enough Vardio will be able to bring it forward Modric around the edge of the penalty area trying to go through but the whistle has gone pick from Ashley made a decent save after free kick was given and it's an opportunity for England just to be able to get the ball out of harm's way from the back nil nil four minutes gone on talk sport yeah just looking at a midfield shape of Rice Phillips and Mount it's Rice he was sort of being a central figure and the deeper of the two allowing Phillips on the right hand side just to flourish a little bit push on look on to people same with Mount as well so it I think it'll be rice you will be asked to get in and around Modric to make sure he doesn't see any space there the referee that's the stock legs the ball hit him it was a drop ball to Croatia which they went out he was the right hand touch line and gave away sending a high ball sailing over the head of the Salico and now for a throw which be taken on the England left hand side Strubears and Sol Campbell alongside me Jim Brown from here at Wembley under the arch on a glorious day his sterling out to bring the ball forward and find Foden takes it into his stride will check left foot he shot across the face of goal he's the inside of the post and Vardy Olli's out of clear his first contribution in the major tournament so nearly ending up in a goal great interplay between Sterling and Foden and Foden has it again just play back towards Carl Walker what a start that would have been Foden again checking laying it back for Calvin Phillips he just has a swagger about him Foden born to succeed at major tournaments you would think with his style of play his competencies confidence and wonderful ability in possession and very nearly giving England a six minute I think that's just shown that we don't need to play at Croatia's tempo and speed we need to play at our own speed and tempo and the pace we've got up front and the threat we got up front the more we can service those front players and the quicker we can do it the better top quality effort there by Foden it was just the liquor paint on the inside of the post that kept that one out rolled away from him and goes out of play interesting that Croatia started with Rebic playing up front Krameric playing on the the right wing anti-Rebic playing through the middle scored against Argentina in the last World Cup and scored 11 league goals in each of his two seasons with Milan Andre Krameric who has been absolutely prolific for often I'm nearly a hundred goals in less than 200 games but he started off on the right Declan Rice heading the ball away through the midfield with Torxport seven gone England have already hit the frame of the goal but haven't hit the net and it's nil nil Rice laying it back towards John Stones the referee's whistle has gone again it's a free kick which will be taken by England mings down to Trippia Kiran Trippia sending a long left footed ball for us and that's the run from Mount who will go down towards the corner flag he's drawing Vida out of position Mount's able to get good possession just on the left hand touch like fighting Sterling Trippias made a run for for him on the the overlap works in field instead towards Mason Mount into the feet of Kane Kane trying to turn inside here Sterling takes it on but can't get a shot in it's a corner Kane thought that he might have had a penalty and Sterling maybe had a penalty shot as well as Charlie the star came across but it is gonna be an England corner yeah I think what we're seeing here England playing at a tempo that is really causing Christ are a bit of a problem and my advice would be don't be shy and getting the ball forward get it in behind their back line for runners whether it be Mount whether it be Sterling and it will cause them a big problem so this first corner is gonna be a Mason Mount in swinging delivery from the England left-hand side and he's got four in and around the edge of the six-yard box Tara means is making a slightly later on it's so deeper towards John Stones who's just beaten it's a volley right footed folly from the edge of the penalty area well hit by Calvin Phillips and it was a decent save from Levakovic you got down to his right hand side ball cleared out of play for a throw this has been a bright promising start as far as down south gates men are concerned no no but England have asked the most potent and pertinent questions in the opening nine minutes Tyrone means just down into the little thin corridor of shadow on the left hand touch on the near side as far as we look at it with rice playing it for for Mount Mount back for Sterling to Rice again options to his right hand side include Walker Walker playing it for now towards Foden Foden controlling it neatly works it away from Perisic just playing it back in towards the edge of the penalty area John Stones will twist away he finds Walker Walker back out for Stones again Stones about eight or nine yards inside the Croatian half four from Foden deflected out of play for a throw which be taken on the England right-hand side I think it's really important Jim that England if they've got a forward pass make that forward pass don't come out don't play safe because I think that's really causing a problem Kane firing it inside the penalty area wonderful scoop in with the outside of the right boot after a great move between him and Foden Phillips then does well to retain possession with two Croatians around him Rosovic snapping at his heels but he maintained it very well this has been an excellent starting when playing at a decent tempo no sign of any real early nerves taken the game to the opposition sure hasn't always been the way in the first match of a major tournament and can read so much from the opening exchanges his mount mount back for Phillips Walker making a good early run down the England right-hand side just couldn't quite control it and it drifts away and goes out of play for a front yeah they've really had problems with with players sterling Foden mount just coming off and dropping in a little wide areas to receive and just having a little look at the volley from Phillips absolute sensational volley watched it straight on to his four went through legs and the goalkeeper done very well to parry out he's still waiting for his first goal for England Calvin Phillips only a ninth count for him today only made his debut back in September very different England side in this first game that it would have been in the first game of the tournament in 2020 came fighting Foden now inside the penalty area Foden just laying it across the edge of the box too far ahead of Mason Mount he can get there but can't run on to it and get a shot in back it goes from sterling to Mount again on the corner of the penalty area with about making a run down the inside left channel work back instead for Foden but control lots and eat entirely that time and opportunity for Kovacic to put his foot on the ball Sariqo then playing about for Kovacic again Croatia try and bring it forward for Brozovic has given it away it was a relatively simple pass to Luka Modric but he's missed him by four or five yards and it goes out of play for an England throw on the left hand touch line you would talk sport in 11 minutes gone England no Croatian ale yeah I think England start has been that positive after the first maybe four or five minutes since then we've really up the tempo we've looked to threatening behind we've got in a good space in the final third and it's almost rock the Croatians a little bit possession in the low 70s for England in these early stages and it's been good possession as well not keeping the ball for keeping the ball's sake his trippier chipping it in Kane trying to flick it on behind him and a good mopping up Perisic who comes back inside his own penalty area from the left wing lays it back for Vida Vida out towards the right back for Sariqo he just gets it for hoping that Rebic can make something of it for him he did actually he headed a ball through the midfield to make it another fight ball which Modric could get on the end of then for Sariqo with a dainty little chip will flick it down the touch line he finds Kramaric little nutmeg there with Modric ending up in possession now back for Marcelo Brozovic again Brozovic such an experienced customer in the heart of the midfield winning his 60th count for his country the Inter Milan player lays it back to Chalata Sariqo from him to Vida scored in the World Cup quarter-final three years ago he gets Russia forward from the back Brozovic out towards the very impressive left-sided defender Gvadijal so such a bright future ahead of him just 19 but it's just been signed in a 16 million euro deal by Leipzig his Kira and Trippia much the more experienced of the two-man playing left-back today from him to Mings to stones back for Mings again Mings controlling it inside his own half then sending it forward long left-footed ball which is easily headed away by Vesalico but straight to Mason Mount and Raheem Sterling has it now coming in off the left hand touch like stops and checks Modric forces him to go back for Kira and Trippia Trippia back for Mings Sterling to Mings again and his bright yellow boots on a glorious day beautiful summer's afternoon here in north London Sterling back for Mings again inside his own half and he'll just emerge from that corridor of shadow which probably covers about a third of the pitch or so back he goes for stones stones under pressure from Rebic to Mings again Mings to Trippia they're just passing it along the back line now Mings will look long Sterling trying to take it on the half turn away from Vesalico is winning his 50th count for his country today Croatia will it back and Brozowicz goes back for Vida Vida finds his goalkeeper who's happy just to slam it upfield Perisic will flick it on but stones is there to mop up and get it back for Jordan pick for 14 minutes gone much to recommend the early stages of this England performance we hear from Sol Campbell in a moment but these are the thoughts of Stuart Pierce yeah I think in games like this when we've had a really good start in the game it's a concentration from the from the back line make sure they filled the ball into midfield and up front and get us playing definitely from that situation and don't play down to Croatia Croatia want to slow the game down and take the sting out the game it's important that we play to a tempo and a speed that suits our players we are a very athletic side it's important we play to that that high tempo stones finds Walker and it goes back to his Manchester City teammate now played out to Manchester City man in Trippia Sterling chips it forward awkward bounce for Vida to deal with Philips is in there to regain possession for England in the engine room and then Mount ever busy just a flicks it off for Sterling down towards Mount again on the left-hand side of the penalty area now just stops and checks right for the ball just took a deflection on its way in Phil Foden just give a little shove under the flight of the ball for Sally co can then claim knocked away Kane brings it forward but Vida gets that one clear around the edge of the penalty area and then Philips was caught and it's a free kick to England about 15 yards outside the penalty area in a central position right at the very extreme of range for anybody fancing a shot not in that too dissimilar a position to that the Kearn trip you put in against Croatia in the World Cup semi-final yeah it's not in a bad area I would say probably slightly too deep and as per normal I hope I've put my foot right in my mouth there and he sinks it in the back of the net but it's certainly some distance that he's got to a to to generate whether it be a little chip up to potentially stones he's just pulled out to the left it is very central so difficult to get an angle on the ball really for that little clip towards either side of the box Foden on the right hand side of the penalty area stones will be much the more obvious target on the left mounts and trippier of the two players standing over it here for England it showed a distance Croatia have not even got a wall it is just clips in looking for Kane Kane with a little flick header it's claiming that he was pulled down the offside flag is up though and it's going to be a free kick for Croatia inside their six-yard box 17 minutes gone England now Croatia now with her from Stuart Pierce a soul Campbell a part of our team as well for the England games here on Talksport so great start plenty to recommend I think it's a great so it's definitely a great start I think we are high the back line is high we're confident Croatia haven't got going that's because we've been pushing and probing and not giving them any a second to kind of settle down which is called to keep it going and make sure the low make sure we don't kind of fall asleep there's always about it's always about concentration at international football England have the ball over on the far touch line midway inside their own half it's gonna be throw which car Walker will take Croatia and finish top of their qualifying group above Wales but they have been beaten seven times this season which is hardly vintage form to come into a major tournament being twice by Portugal twice by France by Sweden and Slovenia and a more excusable friendly defeat to Belgium last week where they went down one nil in their final warm-up game but the penultimate warm-up game is a one or draw at home to one mania which was a very inauspicious result for them and that was with a strong side a much stronger side than England put out for their two friendly victories on T side Phil Foden's got possession on the England right darting twisting turning a little pirouette but couldn't just the con his way through good sliding chance from Calvin Phillips that wasn't quite how the referee saw it for was a foul as he won the ball a little bit overzealously on the edge of the box and it's a free kick that Croatia will take played 18 minutes England hit the post very early on with Phil Foden but it has been a very bright start England next in action against Scotland here Friday night you knew that already eight o'clock to kick off time if you're a Scotland fan and at one commentary with the Scottish angle that's on talk sport to the English angle here on talk sport eight o'clock with a Stuart and salt and sags alongside me here is Mason Mount brings it for for England around the edge of the penalty area slipping in trivia trivia checking back onto his favorite right foot couldn't quite find came but it'd be played back by Phillips Phillips to Declan Rice linking up the play and exchanging passes with his close childhood friend Mason Mount back he goes then from stone stones just given a little shove of the ball from red it you knew exactly what he was doing there just catching stones on the top of the back the stones back on his feet very quickly wasn't hurt but was offended about England if maintained possession and work it all the way back for Jordan Pigford tomorrow another three games coming up for you Scotland begin their campaign home to the Czechs hand and part of venue two o'clock the kickoff time here on talk sport followed by Spain against Sweden in the evening and Poland against Slovakia over on talk sport to England work the ball for now inside the penalty area again just chipped in King's just coming towards the edge of the penalty area England getting the bodies for Phillips taking up some good advanced positions Croatia clear that one and then as Walker works it back in the clear that one as well charity SAR volling it away the tripier nods it down there's a good purpose about England a good temp on the vast majority of the time as well and if there were question marks when the team was leaked this morning and those that were in and those that weren't I think that Garth will already point to the performance over the first 20 minutes to say that the the team selection has been entirely justified but no way through as yet Sterling laying it back for tripier who had already scored one these two met in the World Cup semi-final by this stage I remember that England play Croatia in the Nations League since then it was Croatia that took the lead that day in England but came from behind to win by two goals to one you have one five of the previous ten meetings losing three two of which came in qualified for Euro 2008 and it rained that night as you will remember all play for by mings headed away by the Salico and the strict ice-crammer shot a play for a throw that'll be taken on the England left-hand that many clear-cut goal-scoring opportunities in 21 minutes to it and just that the two for England but still the possession is good they're having any good areas and there's nobody that really looks below the pace for him no and I looked to look through the start in 11 I thought you know who's showing good form for their club and the only one you might have back into the season would have a question mark is Raheem Sterling form for his club and to be fair to him he's been sensational for England but lost four or five years at least and he's earned his place in in this team the rest of them all got good club form and they've certainly shown that and I tell you who impresses me and probably goes under the radar a little bit Calvin Phillips his energy to get near people to go and press to offer he almost does two jobs he's used to playing that way for Leeds they play high energy and he certainly adds that to the midfield and when England are out of possession he will drop back and partner Declan Rice in there but when they have it he's so eager to be on the front foot and to get forward at every conceivable opportunity they certainly playing a good 10 15 yards in front of Rice and being able to take up station around the edge of the penalty area a position that you're balling him also plays well that is Phillips that has been given the nod from the start today and has had an excellent start to this his first game in a major tournament it's nil nil with Salliko in possession bringing the ball forward just trying to take on the Raheem Sterling who maybe gave him a little shove but did so surreptitiously Sterling actually stays down injured for a moment but Trippie is there to get it away and he got it over the halfway line for Kane to chase and feeder and receiving the awkward ball from his subcenter half-partner Chalice Saar but the Ada Brozovic Croatia been able to mop it up pretty neatly on the halfway line now Luca Modric will lay it back for Brozovic again and Kovacic champions league winner with Chelsea brings the ball through the center circle for Croatia Modric taking on got away from Trippie went down is waved up by the referee and Trippie's challenge was certainly firm and Modric far from happy England get the ball upfield and the Croatian goalkeeper Levachevich plays out from the back away from Foden yeah certainly looked like a fail to me and certainly Modric thought that as well but so made a very good point about concentration at the highest level earlier and he's very much that is the case when you step up from club football to international level yet as a defender especially you have to sniff danger before danger is anywhere near where you are on the pitch for Salica right for the ball swung inside the box it's the first ball from out wide that England have had to defend and Tyrone Mings did so very ably coming across again in his head to it steering it out of play for a Croatian throw level the edge of the England penalty area taken quickly by over Salica back from him to so Brozovic now to Chaleta Saar was in that World Cup squad but hardly featured in the tournament for now the Brozovic Matio Kovacic they were to bring it forward and work it out towards the left-hand side Vardio playing at left back but I think he will end up being you said a half in the not too distant future at international level as well as club level his right footed ball just a little bit too steep and that's a sailed straight out of play for a goal kick that'll be taken by Jordan Pickford 24 minutes gone in the sunshine England nil Croatian nil on talk sport coming up later today Austria against North Macedonia that's live on talk sport 2 from 5 and then the Dutch begin their campaign at Hunder Ukraine which is here on talk sport from 8 o'clock don't forget after the game here on talk sport today our England correspondent Faker others will be speaking to all the men that matter again in the reaction of down south gate and the headline makers will hear from Jose Mourinho as well as the most in-depth analysis of the game with song and with Stuart that's all remarks that is at the conclusion of this game and every England game on talk sport 25 gone nil now throw taken quickly by Trippier he's sterling well the idea was right finish wasn't as he just let the ball bounce in front of him and it set up nicely for him but he's hooked the top of his right foot underneath it and he screwed it away with cut spin and it's gone started wide and ended up going ever wider of Lovakovic's goal nil now I ain't trying to put myself in the in the minds eye of the Croatian manager here will be a little bit disappointed England players are getting a lot of space in in that sort of middle to last third area and on that occasion it was sterling you should have done a lot better to be honest Kramaric shot a plate forward here for Revis and mings did well got back to all side and in his gets it for the left hand touch line so much more composure and confidence in his performance today than that that we saw last week in the games against Austria and Romania was I think that he might have played his way out of contention for a place in the starting line up but God's shown faith in him and he's justified it so far mings trying to get the ball away this time can't quite get a contact on it and they fell in behind of the perisic near the edge of the penalty area but his shot way off and out of play for a goal kick nil now it's that type of interaction that we've just seen there the Croatians going down the right hand side whip cross no one got first contact to clear and it ended up being a hitch kick probably just on the edge of the box and it's just those little interactions that we've seen that have caused us a problem we saw it in the last two friendlies last week these wide no one taking control of cutting the cross out or dealing with the cross and players just getting a little bit too much space to potentially get a shot away England's record on home soil has been absolutely fantastic they've had 15 of the last 16 home games with the sole exception being the defeat of Denmark back in October in that run of 16 games have scored average of three a game and only conceded seven all told in fact it's 24 home wins in 26 if you go back that little bit further Southgate only beaten twice on the home soil as the England manager Croatia have possession but not in an area that's going to hurt England they're much nearer the edge of their own penalty area than the centre circle Kovacic just lays it back for Luca Modric England have done an effective job on stopping Modric playing so far but he's found some space this time and he's found Vardion making his way forward in space down that left hand touch line back from Modric again Rice comes forward but can't get close enough to fully engage with Modric uses his range of passing again working with the Vesalico now play four by Modric into Krammerich on the edge of the penalty area good control from him he's back to the direction of play back out for Vesalico England have eight back in the penalty area to defend this and they send in one full back towards the other but again over hit for Cardiola and out of play for a goal kick that'll be taken by Jordan Pickford 28 gone and it's nil nil Sturpeyers yes I was pleased to see that crossover hit the creations have loaded all bases up in our box and it was Vardion with the far post who just got away from Foden but crossed slightly too far for him so what do you want to see more of so far bearing in mind that England have dominated possession in an excellent half hour but have only had the one shot on target but definitely a bit of more of this you know especially from the goal kicks play out you know that's the situation it's four versus two you can get out easy a bit more confidence I think you know allowing Croatia to slowly creep into the game look passes done wide it's concentration but it's also recognizing Croatia yeah when they're holding the ball the slender game down they're picking their passes the slowly kind of getting the foot holding the game we've got to kind of react to that and and see and feel what they're trying to do and get hold of the ball as well especially in the middle of the park and also playing out we've got to get that kind of confidence back because they're slowly slowly chip away us that's all Campbell alongside at Sturpeyers Amnesian Brownford here at Wembley Marksaggers in the chairfaker others are England correspondent Declan McCarthy are in stadium producing your England team for the European championships is nil nil with 29 minutes gone here at Wembley and the fans just a little bit muted I think over the last ten minutes or so there's an undercurrent of singing as you can hear around the stadium but no real hugely vociferous support England will play out from the the back against stones to rice and they fall down the line by Walker and the last three or four minutes have been England's worst three or four minutes off the game but no harm done I should try to take a throw very quickly there but from the the wrong place the Italian referee was alive to that let's just ask for it to be retaken that's allowed England to get their shake back behind the board I think the pattern of the game gym is dictated when we've dictated to the opposition we've been comfortable caused them a problem and the creations have been feeding off scraps relatively within the game and we've just let them into the game it's more not so much what they've done probably more what we haven't done and it's hoping the door for them to get a little bit of confidence on the ball well he always gonna be able to bring it forward again now slinking up with perisic on the Croatian left cross the second deflection mings did well to come across a sweep it away on the half volley Rosovic mobs up lays it back for cover chitch cover chitch will take it on and get away from Foden play for towards the edge of the penalty area cover chitcha continuing his run can work it why perisic can control it he'll try and get down towards the ball against it in red bitch was waiting for it but Declan Rice so alert came back and cut out the cross it was vital for England that he did so and Croatia will have to backpedal and not it with Canada saw back to his own goalkeeper Levakovich and now they will build from a deeper position this is the first time really that Croatia have had a spell in the game where they will feel that they've been on top they have it with for Salico sparse the half hour mark here on talks for Rosovic coming forward for Croatia and that's stretched not happy with his lack of options but he was able to travel with the ball without any England player putting any pressure on him finds Kramrich and that's what's out towards for Salico Sterling does well comes back defense finds trippier trippier back to Jordan Pickford who sweeps it away very effectively left footed well over halfway field will race back and not about to his goalkeeper and England struggling to maintain the the only struggle hold that they had on the game they've lost something in the way of tempo needs trying exert their authority again over the the next ten minutes coming up to half time yeah games have ebbs and flows when you get in the ascendancy and when you don't and probably that little bit of it's inexperience within the team we just need to wrestle that back from the Croatians at this moment in time but the likes of moderate she's clever he's an intelligent player he knows how to get on the ball how to create space and how to dictate the tempo of games as means inside the set of circle it's nil milk here at Wembley between England and Croatia you're listening to Euro game day live on talk sport with intuit quick books helping you take care of business Sterling laying your back for Kieran Trippie and out of Tyrone Mings 33 gone Mings back for stones England that defended with a encouraging highlight in the early stages less so recently play for that what a take-by phone and that got the crowd on their feet beautiful touch with the top of his left boot but as he then just tried to play a little one to over on the far touch line with Walker didn't come off and just rolls away over the dead ball and then out of play for a goal kit great control by Fogman he just can't quite get him into the game enough at the moment no we can't fantastic one though we've played maybe three or four balls just straight long balls this is not just a careless ball it's a cultured person mounts got on the end of one certainly folding on that occasions got on the end and you have to keep turning around which will keep creating the space in front of them and Karl Walker has just been a bit loose couple of these policies just ventured out of play Luca Modric inside the center circle and then very quickly making ground into England territory still mill mill ball played out towards the figure of Paris it's on the left hand side Paris it's an Vardial bearing in mind that they haven't started an international together before her for a very well in tandem that far touch line was the fallback that was the furthest forward on that occasion it goes out of play for a goal kick Jordan pictures still hasn't had a difficult save to make so far 34 minutes in and it is at nil nil England's record of major tournaments as if you need reminding has not been great for wins in 15 games and speeding Ukraine back in Euro 2012 victory against Wales in 2016 and then against Tunisia Panama and Sweden in the last World Cup England off to a winning start in the World Cup three years ago by beating Tunisia and getting off to a winning start has been an exception to the rule Paraguay and then Tunisia again the only other teams that England have beaten in the first match of a major tournament since the 1990s stones with a commanding header away which left Rebic on the deck and he's in a position there you'll remember the little clash between the pair of them about ten minutes ago stones you had a free shot there you come and attack the ball new he's gonna give rubbish a little bit of a bang on the way through and took his opportunity still nil nil tend to go to halftime rice working it forward Phillips back for stones Rebic's trying to second guess where the ball was going next had actually got it right but stones could still get it back for Pickford and that's our own mings has it on the edge of his own penalty area now thinking to build up Jim we've just got to be a little bit quicker you know I think a slow build up and not playing that forward pass to get a player turned on the ball suits the Croatians at the tempo they want to play Mount back inside his own half for Declan Rice the fundamental part of the England team he's started 13 of the last 16 games now winning a 21st international camp today three of them for Ireland at the start of his career he's trippier five sterling sterling in his fourth major tour that for England good injection of pace takes him past Krammerich into what's photon into the penalty area and Fodenway back up by the referee who has let plenty go so far has been very consistent at Daniela your Sato and the ball is played for by Perisic out of harm's way for Croatia and one back by Walker but that was better from England a little more purposeful and the crowd reacting accordingly a sterling desperate to get on the ball drops deep shows for Declan Rice Rice obliges with a little side footed ball for back it goes towards mings now Walker turning it between the two set of halves but safely back to his goalkeeper and England able to get another 10 15 yards upfield with the defensive line trying to condense the play in the midfield stones wide for Walker back it goes again for Jordan Pickford and we're eight from hard time at 0-0 yeah my advice to the likes of sterling mount that the front three really behind Harry Kane every time you get it try and get turned once you get turned go and take somebody on because every time we've done that that they can't live with us we've got too much ability to my too much pace too much endeavor now came John rather challenge of a salico loose ball squirms back for Calvin Phillips Phillips wide for Walker again this a tendency to go sideways rather than forwards at times for England his Mason mount another play that England haven't quite been able to get into the game as much as they would like sterling has seen plenty of it and there was a moment about 30 seconds 40 seconds ago where he made his way for him Vita steps up for the defensive line and follows him and that is Croatia journalist telling me an area where England might be able to exploit them Calvin Phillips is offside here but when you have Vita stepping up from the defensive line it creates space for people running in it was a sterling that created that space on that occasion that's what England need to try and make the most of well we've done it on a few occasions I mentioned earlier you know probably about four or five times we've looked to play that ball into those channels from from varying distances and it's an Achilles heel especially with a pace that we've got from from our players of the likes of Foden and Sterling to get into those areas once you get in there you normally faced with a one-on-one situation 38 on the clock it's nil nil the back of it's the Croatian goalkeeper who's been first choice since 2019 taking his time about this free kick which he sends swirling forward now and then the flag is up again and so an offside of the other end as Andy Rebic should just come back from an offside position still nil now also a really important point to make as well I think certainly with the attacking minded players in the team they almost like there's no point saving yourself physically for games not with the modern day substitution situation chances are Garovs going to make changes in in the advanced areas of the pitch you can almost go out and say look blitz it for an hour and then we'll get impact subs coming on. Inglour working the long ball forward again and towards the the right hand touch line Karl Walker there's nothing in the middle for him he tried to win a corner by bending a right foot he crossed in but he missed his man and it's gone out of play for a goal kick. Five minutes to go to halftime so Campbell part of our team here on Talksport so what are your thoughts? Just like Pearson was saying that kind of ball those third man runs into the into the space you know it is causing a lot of problems but it's all about once we get into that last third and we made that run it's the next ball in it's the cutback who's following through you need someone coming in and you know as of the box cutback shot we need to have an end product we can't kind of get into the box and then we're thinking about what's what we're gonna do with it we need those runners in there we need that kind of that magic that kind of someone making an unselfish run and getting into the box we need that and when we do that we're gonna you know we're gonna cause them problems but at a moment when the game has slowed down we possession it's all about possession we've got to keep possession more but now I don't know what's going on there's a lot of discussion going on with the keeper and nings and I don't know there's a little bit of they're scared or something's going on there's too much discussion going on for my like and it should be just let's go on and play and see what we can do that means we'll have on board over the top of Sterling will run on to it and get their first round the edge of the penalty area and win a free kick it's right close to the edge of the box and Harry Kane thought it was inside of the VAR will check and the challenger Saar making his way forward Sterling inflicted past him and challenger Saar knew exactly what he was doing in leaving a left arm in there the ball hit it and the free kick is for a handball about a yard and a half outside the box and this is a very promising position so made the point there the back line have got a tech responsibility in the goalkeeper of getting on the ball a little bit quicker than they have looking to feed the ball into midfield quicker than they have and on that occasion means this played a ball which I think is almost played a ball to get shut down not a cultured pass and it still caused a problem because of Sterling's ability and speed well this is a really good area favours the right-footed shot mounts and shippier and Sterling are the three England players in attendance but Sterling is very much the outside of the three and he vacates the scene already England have lined up a little two-man wall to the right of a five-man Croatian wall haven't got the old draft excluder in behind the wall oh they have that just putting him down so one line behind a four-man wall it's Kieran Shrippier who's scored from this kind of area against Croatia in the past tries to do so again the wall jumped blocked it goes out of play fourth right yeah hit it good pice but Perisic I think it was managed to get his head to his a good solid wall from the Croatians and that is what the throw quickly shrippier in the waltz around him Sterling and the referee has found against him as a freaking two Croatia that was much better the move that got England into that kind of position in the first place and Sterling when he can attack that back line and win intent and pace it can cause problems Chami Desaar incidentally on the yellow card now because of the handball and so the better of the two center halves is working the tightrope and Vida we know doesn't have that much base at this stage of his career anyway so that's where it's England's way two minutes ago the half time is still near near it's nothing short we just channel balls over the over the back line for decent runs and that that is what causes them problems right slaying it back in for stones back to Miskolki the pick for those shanked it away but to safety it's okay that mounts controls a little bit all please given mortgage and a ceremony shove off the ball it's gone out of play for a throw it's going to be taken on the Croatian right hand side between the back line and the goalkeeper they're almost flustering each other in many ways they just need to settle down a little bit do things a little bit quicker but but don't be panicking about being pressurized I don't think Croatians are pressurized in particularly well Kovacic try to rectify that brings it forward stone steps up from the defensive line loose ball be changed by Walker but Fadiol is going to be there first he lays it back for Paris six towards the edge of the penalty area and it's a back in from again ming stands firm knocks it away he was fouled and it's a free kick to England you listen to the Euro game they live on talk sport with trade point the lineup of over 40,000 products in stores nationwide and online get all you need when you need it at trade point yeah really good into change there on the edge of the box Croatia planning to our penalty area but means come out had to make it a very clean tackle we did that and got fouled in the process but our fortunes in this tournament are going to hinge not on what we do going forward but what we do defensively and I've seen nothing in this first off to change my mind in that respect we've been okay we've been pretty solid came John and not it on here for Foden who's come closer than anybody for England Croatia knock it away the 45 minutes up and no need for any added time almost the perfect start Phil Foden's first contribution of the game to hit the inside of the post with a shot lands as close as either side have come England have seen the game there been flow they've had some good stages they've had some not so good but they're playing with a confidence in a good tempo it's been a solid start to the tournament no breakthrough though England in Croatia in the hard time the one thing I will say and you're absolutely right sacks of the sand next to you a lot of these games it isn't easy watching England at the end of the game and they've certainly seen England start tournaments much worse than they've started this one it's gonna be Croatia get the second half on the way in the all black hit they're kicking from the right to left defending what used to be the the tunnel end of the old stadium and then all white it's no no Charity shot in the book shocks on target and a premium only the one between the two sides so far Phil Foden hitting the post early on closer than anybody to break in the deadlock back on the way and the only touch of the start of the second half of the goalkeeper Dominic Lovakovich who clears it down towards the left-hand side for Paris it's a shot at take on John Stones snatched it past him stones doing well came back found mings mings back inside his own penalty area played it hit perisic moved up on target big foot alert there was enough loop on it that you had time to think about it he took a couple of hasty steps back and made a catch but slightly nerdy start to the second half Paris is just trying to take on John Stones for pace we didn't see that at all in the first no we didn't as I said John Stones dealt with him pretty well rolled it back into to mings and mings cannon these clearance straight into the creation player who looked at the ball just looked and pick for dealt with it I just want to sort of I spoke with Gareth a couple of days after I think it was our internationals in March and then we talked there was a clamour about making a substitution to get a goal at the time I can't remember which game it was and we sort of spoke with each other and he talked about it wasn't a case of bringing someone on it was a case of which one of them do I take off because they're all doing quite well and that's a fair point that you made there and I think it's worth sort of just mentioning now sometimes we've got great options from the bench if someone said to me now which one of the front four do I take off I need a goal it will be a difficult judgment call I think challenge aside finding perisic on the Croatian left-hand side of the offside flag is up it's a pretty good which it's taken by England who have pick for the goal Walker Stones mings and trivia the bag for rice and Gringham midfield with Phillips and Mount either side of him Foden and Sterling wide of Harry Kane up top Croatia the back of it you go to Sarko Vila challenge a star and the teenage who's making his first star for his country quality old Rosovitch anchors that midfield for them Kramaric on the right moderate to cover stitch perisic on the left and anti-revic leads the line means put under pressure by Rebic is it back for his goalkeeper pick for the term to play out from the back John Stones can do that now just easy for Kane comes to meet it are the old who's shown maturity beyond his years and experience was in there and a very poor challenge which is rewarded with a yellow card coverage it's on Foden nice and free kick to England just on the exit of center circle Mason matter beg your pardon the player that was caught there just took the ball was it and coverage it slid in from a long way out a little bit of the ball but it's clearly out of control any yellow car for Mateo coverage for a foul on his club team yeah we'll probably deny the fact he was out of control there what he's done was keep his feet in he's not extended to make the challenge because I think if he did he could have been in red country world in red card world but he done quite well we in some respects kept his feet tucked in probably deserved a yellow card but certainly not red man's okay he's back on his feet nice a free kick which will be taken by Declan Rice back for mings and Mason will work it for down the England left-hand side for Sterling Sterling trying to take the game to the Croatian back line Saliko getting his angles right tribute making his way forward from left back which we nice sporadically in the first half Croatian will try and utilize that space those they work it for links slides in there's enough to deviate the ball away from the path of red it's and then stones will come across the play down by the corner flag but that's given possession away to throw to Croatia right down by that quarterfinal just wait if it should be the push forward and hit the space in behind it yeah in the second half we've had a couple of balls just into the channel area it's extended both stones and means manage just clear things up reasonably comfortably on the Croatian right little back here flick from Luka Modric but all that's inside the box is fallen away by Tyrone mings Kane chasing after it try to make something happen feed are able to guard it back for Chalaza Sar Kane then chases the back pass to the back of it you know he was very much second favorite and then the back of it's the tribute tribute of the back had a just didn't see Revis Pigford's come out swags up and gone away I was hearing tribute just assuming that there was no one there and he turned the back had a back to his goalkeeper and he read his eyes lit up for a moment but pick for very sharp good anticipation off his line should be a extends a hand of apology no harm done but it's a close one thing yeah there's a say Revis was was alert to it made a really good dot in run to try and get on the end of it and fortunately for England pick for got there slightly ahead of him otherwise I think the way committed himself we'd have had a problem it's no no you listen to Euro Game Day Live on Talksport with Intric QuickBooks helping you take care of business John Stones final tire on Mings Mings were working out towards the Cure and Trippia Trippia short of 30 caps for his country now maybe of experience he's made it left back in six of his last ten internationalists for England now despite the fact that he is a right back by trade Rice out for Stones who's counters in the 40s and bring it forward and find Harry Kane dropping off looking for Foden cut out by Perisic Brazovic mopping up in the midfield for Chaleta Saan feeder poking it forward a little bit awkward in the midfield for Croatia trying to extend and keep the move alive eventually mob which is fouled just got caught in the center circle and it's a free kick which would be taken very quickly back on his feet and the veteran Croatian captain will bring it forward it's no no on Talksport a feature of Harry Kane's game certainly over the last season or two has been dropping deep and towing things together and I'm not sure today whether he's been asked to stay for up the pitch or not but he probably needs to start doing that a bit more regularly dropping in and playing together just to break the momentum of the game up a little bit the Salico to Modric Rosovic has it now just brings it back on to his left foot swerves it wide that's a Cardiol he spores back under the close watchful attention of Kyle Walker and Croatia working out wide towards the right-hand side come stretch the play the Salico losing out on the Garen Trivia as soon as Trivia got it Sterling was making his way forward probably needed the ball to be played instantly Vida battling with him holding him up trippiest on world fights K now to Foden get to their feet Foden inside the penalty area two black shirts immediately converge on him Calvin Phillips making the run inside the box Foden with a little 1-2 with Walker his way back for stones again this intent from the English ball that England have worked it back from the penalty area all the way back to the half wayline just dropping deep in a bit to come again Sterling to Trivia works in towards Kane Kane round the edge of the area little reverse ball in didn't fight Sterling that was easily cleared Modric now fouled by Calvin Phillips the referee just from a moment maybe of producing a yellow car for that he kind of raised the right hand towards his pocket but didn't a good free kick to give away with the opportunity for Modric to get past Phillips and into the midfield still no no eight minutes into the second half on talks but I think Croatia will probably be slightly the happier with their start to the second half for pending them back a little bit pretty confident on the ball as I said with Kane I think it's important that on that occasion there he's dropped back and he was part of the build-up scenario in the main I like to see Harry Kane just stand up top but for the sake of this game I think you might need to just drop off a little bit and maybe let the lights and mount and Phillips to run beyond him just to break the backline of the creations up a touch challenge aside for the hotel don't worry Vita plays a club football in Turkey these days for a basic dance now work for by a besanico 15 yards inside the England half chip down towards Perisic Perisic Vardiole the full back outside him clever little back ill-flipped back for Vardiole now towards the edge of the box is Kramerich in a central position man who rode the deadlock the last time the two sides up net here pays it off the moderate to sends one in with power from 30 yards but it's easily claimed by Jordan Pickford little bit frustrated because the quick release seems to be on for a moment Pickford always a goalkeeper who's alive for that but he didn't play it Phillips just put rice under a little bit of pressure with a hasty pass that was just a wee bit panic stricken England can just calm things down walk play forward towards Phil Ford it's interesting Jim sometimes the crowd reaction as a player almost should tell you what to do they're telling the goalkeeper when he catches it you can hear him come on get us going a little bit quicker and he's good coaching many ways you know but it comes from the terraces ten minutes into the second half those the thoughts of Stuart Pierce or Campbell with assault no real discernible change the passenger player the start of the second period no I think there's a little bit of nervousness creeping in I think we're gonna kind of you know get back on the ball a little bit more get some passes together move the ball quicker create two one scenarios all over the pitch they step in like here now Tyrone step in and cause logic a little problem you know we can just always pass in front of players but top players have gone side to side create a scenario to keep them under pressure keep them thinking keep top players thinking if they don't have to think it's gonna be easy going for them just to mark you or track your run here and there so you gotta step it up laser back for Phillips quickly the meetings and afterwards trippier again now Raheem Sterling back for Kieran trippier these passes are brisk enough over 10 15 yards a piece but it did not make any headway now Calvin Phillips will try and make a run to split the lines and he's not well he receives the ball and he turns inside slips it in he's starting and England are off and running Calvin Phillips has made it Raheem Sterling puts it away his first goal at a major tournament for England and if he was a man who had a question mark over his place in the starting line well he has just answered his potential critics and excellent England move Sterling with the sharpness Phillips breaking the lines England with the lead to offensive passes through the lines first one the Phillips he let it run and went beyond the midfield second one a forward pass straight at the heart of their back line and when Sterling ran him behind there was no doubt he was gonna finish really good run by Sterling acres of space and they're under big pressure when they get asked questions physically the quickness of our front line causes them a big problem fantastic goal Raheem Sterling played in three tournaments for England before this one hadn't scored a goal in any of them over 12 appearances at a major tournament but now finds the net but Calvin Phillips take a bow that was a magnificent contribution from it yeah it was the good thing is we were patient at the back but we did we waited for the time to play that pass it was a 30-yard ball straight through their lines and it was a wonderful run by Phillips that created all the problems and all the panic in the back line of Croatia but England have the lead against Croatia before bottom line is just gonna be able to hold on to it but Sol Campbell and Calvin Phillips doing exactly really what you were advocating should be done only a couple of minutes previously it was out of play for a throw which we've taken on the Croatian right-hand side played for a high ball which means will chase and get there John Slantz just let's see what across his body's got to get the first touch he has back for Pickford Pickford calmly getting it out of the water walker walker drives on now England one Croatian now Phillips to Foden Foden to Harry Kane on the edge of the center circle back for Phil Foden again now to Rice and here's the gold scorer Sterling 13 in his last 17 games for England now I had a fantastic qualification campaign where he scored 8 in 7 and he scored England's first goal at the tournament as well and with the format of the tournament only eight teams get eliminated in the group stage if you win any game then you're through just about here's John Slantz Phillips to head towards the left-hand side here for Kieran Trippier 59 minutes back for Declan Rice Rice aside the center circle one for again for Phillips Phillips down for Karl Walker Kane just jogging run trying to draw Chalice Sarra out of position and now isolating himself against Guardi Olvi left back and you work it back through the midfield the other way good patience now and you can hear the intensity of the support the volume is there lifted the England fans lifted by that genuine quality that we've seen in the game back he goes for Rice 59 minutes gone Stones Stones down for Calvin Phillips Stones just working in the feet of Harry Kane so he was foul referee and has played it go on because England have still got possession Walker waiting for Kane to get back to his feet then plays it into his captain Kane with a good turn Bosvich comes forward and it was one nibble at the ankles to Manny to bring the free kick being no hurry to take it so Campbell your thoughts on that England got now play for again towards the edge of the penalty area by England Sterling laying it off for Rice back for Calvin Phillips again Phillips inside the center circle now John Stones has got it it's all inside Croatia territory Foden Foden again splitting the line Sterling working it wide to make some outlifting side of the air it's Kane always missed it sliding in far post and he said himself as well potentially colliding with the post and Levakovich the Croatian goalkeepers very concerned so ball across the six-yard box Kane was right by the post as he slid in couldn't get the contact he needed to double England's lead but his momentum has taken him straight into the post it might be his left shoulder that has borne the brunt of that or potentially even the side of his head that was the last one yeah I think it's his left shoulder he's just gone past the goalkeeper shoulder stroke ribs but it's got to say wonderful ball in and for all intents and purposes you felt as though Harry Kane was going to score there he doesn't often miss and he's just stretching too much and got over the top of it once again good play by England took the chance played forward passes got turned and eventually got the effort of the far post I still down receiving treatment away to our right-hand side so what are your thoughts on what we've seen over the last four five minutes of Harry Kane incident but also the goal the procedure what a change really for me to make what a goal does to the team and you know just pushing them and probing and getting into you know breaking those lines and getting in those good positions a great great ball behind the sterling sticks it away that's what you want and the confidence is his office is coming back and the shame about you know came confident you know just just a minute ago but the confidence is flying now and that will do the world a good for the teams especially the young players to settle them down as well while the world the first world you heard was Harry getting getting back to his feet and the second as he almost squinted down towards the corner flag to get behind the touch line so that he could come back on his been waved on he's okay and England are as well at the moment leading by a golden ill with the Raheem sterling breaking the deadlock after an extra Calvin Phillips run and pass 12 minutes into this second half on Torx sport sterling's 15th goal for his country every single one of them has come in a competitive international I think Jim it's important that we understand how to play now we've taken the lead don't just slow it down for slow it down sake hopefully Croatia will come on to us a little bit and create space but we've still got a push forward and almost take a leaf out the Italians books from the other night they've scored one they've scored two and still they kept coming forward it is almost the best means of defense as a naughty one from Foden who just make contact with the back of the olds here gets a yellow card is fun played the advantage to start with because Croatia still have the ball but party all riding around in pain and so he stopped it so we can see if any treatment is necessary but Foden in the book actually just that's calling on the top of the foot rather than the Achilles so phone and put leading by a golden hill we've played 63 minutes on the talk sport it's it that's strange modern day phenomenon in football when it you get booked not so much for what you've done but for the reaction of your opponent nothing that's what folding what book for there is starting with a little drop of the shard when he got away from Prosevich and then ran into the Salico referee said he was nothing more than a genuine coming together between the two players actually sterling back on his feet didn't really complain about it but few of the others did Chalice the star has it for Croatia England leading courtesy of that Raheem Sterling gone listen to Euro game day live on talk sport with trade point lineup of over 40,000 products in stores nationwide and online get all you need when you need it at trade point England needed to lead and they've got it Modric work wide out towards the right hand side for salad goes ball in it's coverage it's your crowd it plays not to a another shot through a crowd of players from Rebic just drag wide that was a half chance yeah it was pinball in the box there ball bouncing around and was Rebic it come out to eventually on the edge of the box and our hearts were in our mouth and he just pulled it wide if the if the score stays 1-0 you know full between now and the end of the game there'll be one or two nervous moments and we've got to make sure that we don't add to that we've got to make sure what we do puts them on the back for best way of doing that get a second you made about the Italians the things very significant because they were really going after Turkey in that game England might be able to do something similar now because man can bring it forward and Mounties goal side he just tried to towards can he was brought down and it's a free kick to England five yards outside the box and another yellow car this time for Marcelo Brosevich absolutely surprises that it's taken any three quarters of the game before he's got his first one of the tournament Brosevich's the third relation player to have his name taken but in fact it's probably a good free kick to give away because Mount was making good progress and he had came in space to his right and Brosevich did everything he could to make sure that Mount couldn't play the pass. Whenever we've got in situations like that when there's been a one-on-one player being exposed the Croatians are fine being found wanting that they've got the energy or the legs to be fair dealing with the likes of Mount Fogun and Sterling when you come in at the tournament they are a handful to defend against. So Proletia lining up this defensive wall of Akavic just cramps down he's got his left shot against his post he's got five in the wall England of again station two in front of that wall it's gonna be Mason Mount to take it right foot in oh it was close over the bar but close and it just kissed the roof of the net on its way over and he had the Makulic straggling across his line very grateful just to see that the ball cleared his crossbar as a close run for him. Yeah I think he had it well covered he's gone goalkeeper's side but it just didn't get the dip early enough. Got a new though. You've got a new Aladar but not a second goal for England. The middle way through this second half. With Torxport those are the thoughts of for Sturepears England leading Croatia. By a golden elm next in action against Scotland here and eight o'clock kickoff Friday night and that's life you want Torxport and Torxport two. If you want the Scottish angle to the commentary Torxport two is your place to go and if you're an England fan then it's here on Torxport that we'll be talking through the action. The Akavic goalkeeper lays out from the back good pressing from Mount he's gonna be unrewarded but it's just played out towards Broznic and Mount head after him and closed him down. Now they are just showing those seeds of doubt in the Croatians as the men in black shirts have possession and Croatia I think are going to be the first to bring the changes. Change is going to be made over on the far touch line and it's Vlasic who will come on and Vlacalo as well. So Vlasic who never really showed ever some fans exactly what he was about but he's had a very good career since leaving Goodison Park and you know as at Bregalo will be on as well. Croatia in possession. I think we've got Rashford coming on as well for England. Kibben. They're just able to play it forward. Goes out to the Croatian left and an opportunity for Fulbac to make his way who's that hit last. Walkie yes. It's out of play for a Croatian. Let's join the Torxport England goalie Faker others. Faker Fane. They will have all the reaction. It's been the Garas Southgate and the head line makers at the end of this game. It's been four and five here on Torxport. Will it be an England team celebrating at the moment so far so good. One little England in comes this Croatia corner from Modric towards the edge of the air. Right foot in Vali. Drag wide again. Well they just worked the one back towards the edge of the box. Brozovic ran onto it but pulled it wide and that's going to be his last kick because he's going to be replaced now by the more attack mighty Nicola Vlasic who scored at home to Sweden and France in the Nations League. 12 goals for CSKA Moscow this season so he will come on and Josip Perekulo. Kelo has a right winger against Slovenia but ordinarily plays as a 10. He's the other man that is going to be coming on here for Croatians and will make their change at this juncture as well. Looks that way. Kramaric is the man that Perekulo has replaced and sure enough it is Phil Foden who hit the inside of the post early on and he will make way here for Marcus Rashford. So to Jason for Croatia one for England. Should be. Yeah I think Rashford will play on the left potentially Sterling who will slide across. That's what he's doing there. So Rashford's coming from the right hand side. So Marcus Rashford makes his way on. Big ovation for it. England leading by Goldemir. Rashford is scoring five of his last six games including the winner against Romania last time out. One more England lead. I think if you're a Croatian defender and you're a little bit worried about the pace all of a sudden seeing Rashford coming off the bench on 70 or 70 minutes is a major concern for them. Salika playing here forward. Mings is there and knocking away for England. Goes into the feet of Sterling. England just mopping up very niggly entirely. Working back for Mings. Mings dropping his shoulder turning inside the box. Gets it away from Revis. Troupier into the midfield for Rice. Kane drops off. It's a lovely ball. Flick forward scooped the outside of the right boots. Joss got over the fire touch line and had a play for a throw. It's one of the best attempts of Mason now. It was an excellent piece of play. Assault Campbell, part of our commentary team as well. That was so much tournament experience playing for England. So what are your thoughts on that change? Rashford for Fogholtz? Well it's a great change really. I know Fodos are running south into the ground and you've got Rashford coming on. Pace, Skill and I for goal. The creations of the definitely going to be worrying about him getting on the ball in one-on-ones scenarios in the last third. So great substitution. Vlasic slaying the ball off. Brekolo play forward to Vlasic again wearing 13. The former Everton man chipped in left footed. Perisic going up for it inside the penalty area. Walk down well though by Walker. He headed it forward and now Rashford was scamper after it. Coming across Chalets-Assard just locked it away from Marcus Rashford's run. Has come off the bench as many times as he started for England in an international career which is now five years old Marcus Rashford. Croatia working it towards the edge of the England penalty area again with Kovacic sending it wide. Vlasic to the full back for Saliko. Vlasic has already seen plenty of it since coming on and Declan Rice is trying to stop the cross coming in. Now it is chipped inside the area. It should be an easy one for Walker just to shepherd it back to his goalkeeper. He knew that Perisic was coming in blind side of him but he just got his body in the way and Pickford could come out and claim it after a bounce inside the six yard box. And England lead Croatia 17 minutes ago here on Torch Sport. You know, gotta give Col Walker a lot of credit there. The ball bounced in the six yard box. What I hold is in my mouth. They dealt with it really well. Just shepherd it back to his goalkeeper. England 17 minutes away from getting off to a winning start in the Euros for the first time ever. Chalaza has attacked the balls gone right through the back of Harry K. He is already on a yellow card. Chalaza, that in itself got a yellow card offence but the next one might be in terms of persistent infringement. Kain gets up feeling the small of his back. He's okay. It's going to be an England free kick which will be taken about 15 yards inside Croatian territory. Some continues to shine. Just a little bit of white wispy cloud in the arch as we look up at it over on the top of the roof on the far touch line of this magnificent stadium. The atmosphere with the supporters in here today and the last majority delighted with what they're seeing. Mings, it's not even down for Sterling. And he couldn't get underneath it. There's a free attempt. He's only about 11-12 yards down. Maybe had time to take a touch and do something more constructive with it. It's just a straight free kick punted forward. Mings heading it back down and Sterling had a lot more time than he thought. Went for goal immediately and missed the target by a distance. Mings' set up play there. Fantastic. Headed it back and it's probably the Achilles heel over. He should have done so much better there. It was a really poor effort. It's just a wild swing at the goal. Skyed it like the one he did earlier in the first half. Now England have got a problem with John Stones who is down injured inside the centre circle. It's just that sitting down, an obvious concern. Now with Harry Maguire already out. If England were to lose their other first choice centre half, then the potential ramifications will be obvious. He's sitting down just stretching the toes of both boots towards him. Yeah, I think he's, well I don't know if it is cramp or not. But when he first went down I thought it was cramp. But I'm not so sure he would have got back to the centre circle and gone down again with cramp. I think it's probably something to touch more than that. Ben White's been set out to warm up. Wight and Mings not to set the half part. As you can see with Moe's disrespect at all that Garry Southgate would have been expecting to field at any stage of a match in a major tournament even probably six weeks ago. But Stones is back on his feet which is good to see and he's not making his way towards the fire touch line. He's making his way towards this near one which suggests that he is going to be able to continue. That's a very heartening sign as far as England support is concerned. I think it was a blow on his knee by the looks of it. No way they were flexing his knee. But hopefully it will be okay but sometimes going off and coming back on the pitch doesn't mean that they can continue. Just taking a little bit of fluid on board. Philips put the ball out of play so that Stones could receive the treatment that was necessary. Anker O'Asia restarted it with a throw that was taken by Perisic and Rebic. She chips it back out for an England throw. Carl Walker spinning the ball in his right hand a couple of times. Spacing a few seconds. Now Hales a long one down the touch line. Kane sandwiched in between the two of the Croatian defenders. Croatia winning the seconds and Philips is in there again. He really has had an excellent just this contribution for the goal. Vida played forward. Kovacic is working for over the halfway line. Goes into the Vida Vlasic back for Modric again. Kovacic covering a lot of ground. In and out towards the right hand side for his full back for Saliko. England won it up on Torxport only 13 minutes to go. Last on these two med at Wembley. Scythe was winning with 13 minutes to go. Lost. Here's Perisic play back towards Gvardian. Gvardian all back for Kovacic again. Now Luca Modric who so far England have been able to restrict Vida plays it for. Saliko again. England just dropping that little bit deeper. He'll sit back inside the penalty area along with the goalkeeper but as it's right down the touch line or it has taken a touch of an England man it's gone out for a throw which be taken by the Croatians. And Tram build again towards the edge of the penalty area. Nice turn by Rebic. They've got a man on the overlap. Low ball play in. Well read by Declan Rice. He took a touch with his right foot. Smashes it away with his left and puts it out of play for a throw and another change will be made on the Croatian bench over on the far touch line. This their third and it's the striker who's coming on. Petkovic who was left out of the starting line up today. He played against Belgium last week. Has scored these last six games since he headed against Portugal back in September. Has made 40 odd appearances in Serie A as a striker and has failed to score yet. But he's on now. Here's the Demos diagram man is replaced Rebic to strike swap up front. One little England 12 minutes ago on talk score. Yeah I'm just looking at the England bench and I'm not sure I've got quite a distance away here but I think it's Bellingham who's just been shouted to to go warm up. I think that is down there. So I've obviously got it in their mind to make things a bit more stable. It's important as well Croatia potentially will pin us back if we don't get the second goal. The lights are Rashford and certainly Stirling who does it more naturally just to drop in and offer that little bit of a barrier in front of their fallback. 11 to go. One little England. Pinkford takes the free kick and he said just send it right down the left hand touch like Stirling going up for it. Hike disadvantage against the man marking in Vesalico and he drifts over both of their heads and out of play for a throw to Croatia but midway inside their own half. Just about match management now. It was a long period whereas in England Fannie Muir has felt that one little England was a dangerous school line. I think back to the first game of Euro 2004 where England were a go up against France for a long long time and then proceeded twice to Zidane in stoppage time to end up getting beaten by two goals to one. Nobody's taking anything for granted yet but you'd rather be one that up than one that down at this stage. Rashford chipping it forward. Kane watching it over his shoulder. Well Chase after it might get there ahead of Vida. He didn't quite. Vida can just get his right foot to it working back to his goalkeeper. Novakovic plays out for Modric. Modric out to the right hand touch line. Over the final 10 minutes with the lead still intact. Vesalico. I'm sure we've had a little more purpose about them since they made the attacking changes. Prevolo is always lively. Just coming in off after right hand touch line having an important effect at the moment and Kramerich did. First opportunity for Peckovic. You will make his way forward now into a central position. An opportunity for the Croatians to give him something to attack. Prevolo is out there with Sterling. Sterling trying to prevent the cross. Prevolo ends up on the deck. Sterling ends up with a ball and takes a touch inside his own penalty area. As he gets it away he does actually find Croatian territory. Blowing because Salazar saw the ball run underneath his feet and he had to work his way back inside his own penalty area to rescue possession. Then there's his play for by Kovacic. He's missed his man Perisic by 20 yards and he goes out of play for a front. Nine minutes to go and Dubebelem just receives his final instructions for a go. So yeah I'm pleased to see this boy getting on. He's one tip by many in and around the game to have an impact at this tournament. You know that really good solid performance. We're in game management time now. Last nine minutes of the game plus a bit of added time. Sensibility, opportunity, account, and attack as well. Harry Kane is the player who's going to come off and Danielli Osada the referee is just saying he's got to leave by the nearest touch line. Kane's taking the captain's armband off and setting the referee. Well I've got to give this to somebody and the referee said don't worry about it. Kane gets a big ovation. There's a moment of history here for Dube Bellingham who becomes the youngest player ever to play out the Euros. The Dutchman Jettro Willems who was 10 weeks past his 18th birthday. Dube Bellingham just a fortnight short of his 18th birthday. So what for the might not last for long because Polish goalkeeper Kasper Koslowski could beat his record in this tournament. Dube Bellingham at 17 playing for England in the Euros. So it shows the trust that the manager has in this young man you know and the faith he has in him that he's prepared to put him on the pitch at this stage of a game. Also as well I quite enjoyed your little Dutch Steve McLaren type Jettro. Very good. Ball played on the top Rashford would chase it. And it goes all the way through to his goalkeeper. Oh I don't know what you're trying to say with that little observation. You cheek him up. Ball to play forward here. Ball to play it into the Park of Cobbichic. I think it was the left hand side. I think it's a really sensible substitution actually. We've got a threat of Rashford now down the middle. So if they come on to us and see Rashford's pace or get in there and Mount just filling this right hand side berth and we just look a little bit more secure defensively I think. So it is pretty much a 4-5-1 now. Mount on the right. Sterling still on the left hand side. And it's Phillips, Reiss and Bellingham in midfield three as we look at it. High ball inside. Pickford's penalty area is comfortably claimed at an over hit cross from Perisic. It's still good of course problems because it was not too far away from curling that top right hand corner. Pickford's handling is assured. An England's Sol Campbell are seven minutes away. You can't just position now. You just all about concentration. Keeping the ball. Don't do anything silly. And keep the ball moving and probe as well. If you can nick another one why not and calm all our nerves down. But now no silly mistakes. Keep it easy now. My memory goes back 25 years. We're in a similar position against the Swiss and some idiot called Pierce playing at the back give a penalty away. And it ended 1-1. But we've got much more intelligent players out there today than we had in those days. No turkey or master. Spore your afternoon today. Don't worry. One nil to England at the moment. You can remember it. How do you think the rest of us feel? The challenge coming in on him. The referee decides it's just a little bit too overzealous from Calvin Phillips. That's free kick to Croatia. Not in a shooting position at all. They're going to make another change before the free kick is taken. That's Povacic who's come off and it's going to be replaced by Pasilic. Over on the fire touch line. Maria Pasilic, the German born player who at an end aside from Chelsea. Played at all six of the nation's league games. And he'll come on fourth change for Croatia. Modric standing over this free kick. England shuffle away from the edge of the penalty area to keep a higher line. Free kick is over towards the right hand touch line. Modric addresses the ball just to see how far England are prepared to drop. Now he starts his run up again and he bends it in right footed in towards Celeto. Salve referee saw some pushing and shoving going on. That sweep the sound of that whistle. Free kick to England. Yeah they done well there. The England back line kept us as high as they possibly could for as long as they possibly could. And just I think it was either a foul or probably a slight offside I would suggest. Certainly Celeto's all was all over stunt. As long as they were actually to withstand the physical nature of that battle. And won it anyway. There will be a free kick which will be taken by England's Jordan Pitford. And the clock is ticking down into the 87th minute in a moment. England's still leading. Chelsea and that round he's sterling goal from half an hour ago. Is it going to be at the 10th time of asking? Victory in the first game of the Euros for England. Pitford sending the free kick forward. Has just flighted it straight out of play. The throw which will be taken on the Croatian right. The Salica has the ball in his hands. He works it forward over the half way line. Pashelic in the centre circle with the target of the pass which was a forthcoming. And Marcus Rashford then will chase as Croatia have to back pedal quickly. Celeto's start finding his goalkeeper. The back of it's out to the centre half again. And now out towards the full back for Salico. Celeto's start once more has the ball at his feet. Three and a half minutes to go. The stoppage time, there will be a little bit. Harry Kane went down, John Stone has gone down as well. Both able to continue after the respective collisions that they endured. So might be four minutes. Modric, obviously into the game so far as he's off of the way in the Champions League football. Sometimes not quite as often, or quite as much as you think the added time. So potentially it could be three. Three minutes before we find out. The amount of substitutions we have now could be eight. He's sterling. Back in defensive, Ducati adding starting well. Sheparding the ball over the line. And it goes out of play. A little chest bump there between sterling and Kier and Shupia. England know that they're on the verge of getting off to a winning start. But they also know. Like they haven't achieved anything yet. Pickford's spotted the ball down on the edge of the six-yard box. England just indulging in more match management as you would expect, as you would want. Wasting as much time as they think they can get away with. Pickford slams it forward now. Helped on through the midfield. There's a nasty clash ahead. Stomagoy-Theder has gone down and Jude Bellingham is down as well. And the referee indicating very quickly that he wants medical staff of both countries to come on. Veda is okay. He's sitting up straight away. In fact, he's got back on his feet. Jude Bellingham, less so. Now Bellingham, Veda could just brace himself for the inevitable collision. Bellingham with his back to the direction of play didn't know it was coming. And it's come off a worse of the two. Yeah, really big leap there by Bellingham. And when you jump and you're trying to flick the ball on. You leave yourself very, very open to anything that's coming in behind. It's just a very genuine clash of heads by both players. And Calvert-Lewin is being readied on the bench as we speak. Don Calvert-Lewin who scored the winner in the under 20 World Cup final against Vena as well. Back in 2017, four international goals. And this is first season as an England player. And he will also come on for his tournament debut in a moment. You're in the 89th minute. Raheem Sterling, who's the captain's arm band now that Harry Kane has gone off. And he's the man whose goal is the difference between the two sides. And he's just in this break of play. Going around some of his teammates. Just talking through what is necessary from here on in. Bellingham's okay. He's got the protective hand of his manager on his right shoulder at the moment. He's going to be way back on at the moment. England take the free kick and take it quickly. The idea was right. The execution not quite as mount had made a very good early run down towards the right hand corner flag. But the ball was overhead. And he goes out of play for a goal kick. And England not making the change just at the moment. Bellingham is back on. But Calvert-Lewin hasn't come on just yet. 20 seconds plus stoppage time to go. Shaw will now be at least four minutes to be added on. Passionate Chazard on the left-hand side of the Croatian midfield. He goes back for his left back Guardiol. Who's been solid enough at the age of 19 on his full international day. It's got a bright future out of him. Fida. That's towards Vesalica. He will walk you back to his goalkeeper again. England happy. All the time that the ball is in that half of the field. Four minutes to be played. Long right foot of ball over the top from Calvert-Lewin. Paracic is going to chase it. Paracic nods it down. Should be Pickford's. And he will just let the ball roll and roll and roll. But still get there ahead of Pashlic. And England are three and a half minutes of playing time away from a victory. In the first game of Euro 2020. Yeah, fortunately there for England and Carl Walker. Paracic didn't have any support with him. So when he headed in across Galway, it was three England defenders. And Pickford just went up in the problem up. England have only had two shots on target in 90 minutes. One of them has gone in. In tournament football sometimes that's all that matters. More importantly Jim, sorry, he's affecting the creations. I'm not sure how many they've had won. So that is a more impressive stat I think for us. There's our play for Goldgear, which the back of itch is going to take. He leaves the field, chucks the captain's arm and Marcus Rashford. And here's Dominic Cowan-Lewin. Wearing 18 and coming on. Here's the international cap count up into double figures. And he'll come on for the last two and a half, three minutes or so. England just have to stand firm for the next few exchanges. Ball play four down the Croatian right. Mings letting the ball run across his bodies. And put under pressure. He has been able to get it back to his goalkeeper, although Pickford had to scramble to stop it going out of play for a corner. Launched forward by Pickford. Cowan-Lewin are such a fantastic outball now for any aerial ball that's sent forward from the England back line. Cowan-Lewin won it, but Croatia won the seconds. Good play from Vardion. Very neat and tidy in possession. Finding Modric. Modric to his right hand side for Vida. We're in the 93rd minute. One little England here on Torxport. Flash hits and Breckelow combining. Sliding challenge comes in to knock it away. That came from Drew Bellingham. It was much appreciated, excuse me, by the England crowd. I thought the ball had gone out of play for a throw and hadn't. Modric has it. The deepest of all the Croatian outfield players. Sent forward inside the penalty area. Pickford comes out and catches it. And England are nearly there. Stuart Pierce. Yeah, we've been pretty consistent this second half. And to be fair, once we get a nose in front, I haven't really been threatened too much with Croatia getting back into the game. This will give us a wonderful lift. If we go over the line here with three points, first group game, which England really do, will give to squad and the team and the manager a big lift. And they have been eliminated in the group stage four times in the last eight tournaments. But this result will mean that chances of that happening are extremely small. Providing they can hold on. Carl Walker lays it back for his goalkeeper. Pickford's got time to take a touch. And his second one goes off the island, but out of play for a throw just in Croatian territory. And we've got 40 seconds of the minimum four minutes still to be played. England crowd wanting to hear the four-time whistle. Feder to Modric. Chip Ford, Matt lets it run. Calvin Phillips lets it run out. And it's a throw to England inside the round half. And another chance just to run the clock down. England close, so close. Finishing line almost within touch and distance. What a lift. This will give the players what a lift it will give the England supporters. Walker throwing it forward over the head of Coward-Lewin. Rashford able to win the seconds. Play back to the goalkeeper, Lebacowicz takes a touch, comes outside the penalty area. His Vida four minutes are up. High ball fall from Vida. Flick's on, but away from Perisic. He'll go out of play for a Croatian throw. Left with the edge of the England penalty area. Perisic waves everybody inside the box, but they'll barely be time to take the throw. Peckovic is in there. The principal aerial target. Shadow the Stars in there as well. Long throw inside the box. England with a contact, plays over the bar from Pasalic. And that should be that. And the referee signals the end of the game. England off to a winning start in the Euros for the first time in their history. At the tenth time of asking, it's the W for the three Lions first up. And it all came after Calvin Phillips' excellent contribution. Slipping Raheem Sterling in. The one moment of genuine England attacking quality. And it's given them the victory. Defensively, this remodeled defence was sound. Only one Croatian shot on target. Certainly more to come from England as an attacking force. But the bottom line is that the highest rank to find an England will face in the group stage. Have been beaten. Raheem Sterling giving England the win. In the one, Croatian ill.",
