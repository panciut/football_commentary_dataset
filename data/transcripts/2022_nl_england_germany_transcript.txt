 She presented the FA Cup, it was to Billy Wright in 1949. She also gave Stanley Matthews his winner's medal in 1953 after the Matthews final and on the program cover tonight that famous moment it's in black and white but I'm sure you remember it in vivid technical are those who can remember the Queen who is in her yellow coat and a yellow feathered hat handing the jewel remake trophy to Bobby Moore in his red England shirt after he wiped his hands on the red velvet of the royal box and the lights have been dimmed inside Wembley Stadium and hundreds thousands of people have now put their lights on on their phones and Jeff Hearst and Burt Neumann and Debbie have walked to the side of the pitch and placed those white flowered wreaths on the side of the pitch and the two sets of players are gathered around the center circle to remember the late Queen the image of the Queen's face on the huge electronic screens above either end of the ground and it really was actually a very subtle and effective touch to to dim the lights inside Wembley Stadium just add that element of darkness and all of the lights in the stands so the team's now ready for the start of the match England and Germany playing each other for what is the 34th time old foes England in the red Germany in the white shirts just 55 days to go before the world cup kicks off and exactly two months to the day before England play Iran there is only this 90 minutes of football to play for England Danny Macalee blows his whistle a huge cheer from the Wembley crowd a full house here this evening and Germany get us underway and immediately fire the ball forward and there's a header away on the edge of the box it comes back to Harry Maguire who just lifts it forward into the center circle and Harry Kane is pulled over on the halfway line although I think he's given it for Kane's initial challenge on Schlotterbeck although Kane looks over his shoulder and glares at the referee as if to say how can you have the temerity not to give that my way Chris Sutton he does but he also looks over his shoulder and catches Schlotterberg in the neck and takes him out really so I think that was the correct decision so England and Germany the England side tonight if you've not heard two changes from Friday night in Milan Nick Pope continues in goal stones Dyer and Maguire the three central defenders James on the right Shaw on the left Dullingham and Rice in the middle Fodman Stirling either side of Kane and England win the ball back here Shaw plays it up towards Stirling Stirling who scored the opening goal if you remember in the last 16 at Euro 2020 and here is Stirling who does well on the left hand side gives it to Kane through the middle that's a crunching challenge on him from Schlotterbeck who gives a bit back there to the England captain who's okay he's quickly back up on his feet and England have it again on the halfway line so the German side tonight Tess Steggen of Barcelona in goal Manuel Neuer the usual captain had COVID last week so he's not involved Leon Goretzka likewise they courted it Octoberfest apparently so the back four tonight I'll tell you in a moment because England have it on the right hand side it's played for for Kane Kane turns and twists and plays the ball in and it comes off the shins of a German defender and out of play for a throwing down the right hand side Kane is going to take this quickly which he does back to Reese James James in field towards Declan Rice looking forward to seeing how this Rice-Bellingham partnership is going to look tonight and now Shaw on the left hand side Shaw gives it back and McGuire just stretching for it plays it to Eric Dyer playing for England again at Wembley after making his England return with the ball halfway inside his own half so that German side Tess Steggen in goal back four of Kera Zula Schlotterbeck and round and Kimmich and Gundewan in center field lots of familiar names in this German side Hoffman on the right who scored when they played each other in Munich in June in the nation's league earlier in the group Jungtjermal Moussiala the number 14 who played for so many of the young England teams but has committed himself to Germany exciting by a Munich talent Leroy Zanne on the left and Kai Havertz up front so Nilnil very early stages were in the third minute Chrisson yeah in England with a 343 formation in the Germans setting up they started with a back four against Hungary went to a three back three in the second half but they'll try and dominate the ball the Germans will as they do in most games just lack that punch in recent times albeit they did get five against Italy but Kera Zaske really needs a performance from his England team this evening yep that was their only win in their last six internationals Germany and there are questions being asked about Hansi Flickside so that's the other side of the coin tonight it's important for Germany as well as England and England playing the ball too sterling he's way over there on the far side of the field but he's surrounded by Germans on either side of him and it is Germany who come away with the ball and it's deflected out of play in the end a German foot so Luxo has a throwing level with the edge at his own penalty area England Nil Germany Nil BBC Radio 5 Live Listen as well on BBC sounds tonight and Luxo still waiting to take this throwing making his return to the England starting line he's not started for club or country Luxo since August the 13th started Manchester United's first two matches of the season and there's a slip on the halfway line by Raum the left back but Rhys James was quickly closed down and James gets it back now from Bellingham Bellingham wants it Bellingham of Borussia Dortmund playing against so many familiar faces for him James now on the right hand side James being forced in field by Raum he is Bellingham again but kind of habits is after him so it has to go back to John Stones who gives it back to Nick Pope who quickly gets rid of it straight away I think that's probably the best option for the new Castle goalkeeper Keynes overhits it pass out to the left hand side sure can't reach that it's out of play for a three to the Germans yeah well Nick Pope interesting call getting the not again this evening but I've got to say he always looks a bit clumsy with his feet uncomfortable yeah clumsy uncomfortable but he kicked one out of play a couple of minutes ago didn't he and then taking no chances there but see the way the Germans have set up they'll really overload the centre of the pitch and England have got to find a way of getting up the pitch which they struggled to do and go against Italy they were from Declan Rice centrally then the balls played over the top for Sterling down the left hand side but that's tied it up by big Nicholas Zula passes it back to Kers Degen excellent goalkeeper to have as your second choice the Barcelona man who passes it out from the back and then Rhys James concedes a throw in just down in front of us here our commentary box back in our commentary box our glass fronted commentary box at Wembley Stadium in these better times round playing it infield to Kimmich who then passes it back to Thier Steegert second choice but it is his 30th cab lots of experience and here is young Muziala who's carrying the ball forward from the halfway line but then Declan Rice is able to step into his path but Muziala is back on the ball again the number 14 giving it out towards the the right hand side Hoffman is there now Kimmich is involved back more centrally to Gundawan square from Gundawan remember Gundawan was injured wasn't able to play in the game here at the Euros when England eventually and dramatically and excitingly won it with the two late goals now Thomas Mulla in the team tonight that's one of the four changes that Hansy Flick has made to his team from Friday night Rudiger suspended so he couldn't be involved Gnabry Mulla and Verna are all among the substitutes here is the Manchester City man Gundawan gives it to Hoffman and then back into the German half the white shirts of Germany with a big black stripe down the middle a little bit like the Ajax style black shorts and white socks so everyone's got their World Cup kits on in this in these international matches these are the shirts that we will see in Kata in two months time when we will bring you every blow of that World Cup on Five Live and here on BBC Radio here is Muziala nice nice turn away from Rice little touch to Kimmich but that breaks down and now Thornton can bring it forward for England over the halfway line Thornton just a little touch to Kane to his right hand side Sterling's available on the edge of the box Kane curls it in towards the back post but beyond the run of Thornton and it will run over the white line and behind for a goal kick that's when England look at their most dangerous turn over there belling him did well to win the ball back and England they're away as the ball goes out wide right to Harry Kane it's a terrific ball in it really is and he's not far away from picking out Raheem Sterling and Phil Thornton at the back post in fact so Germany with it inside their own penalty area that was another feature of the other night you know the talk of how England need to move the ball more quickly I feel like we say that virtually every time England get together at one stage or another but also making the right decisions and and that was better that more promising from England but nil nil very early stages here's Gundawan the bearded Gundawan looks up and then just taps it forward towards Muziala can play in any number of positions Muziala the 19 year old Bayern Munich man who's made a brilliant start to this season as well here is Gundawan 30 yards out just runs his foot over the ball England have got everyone apart from Harry Kane in their defensive third he has to cross from the right hand side which doesn't reach habits but Eric Dyer was behind behind him and headed behind for the first corner match to the visitors from Germany in Germany just controlling the game a little bit in the early stages England there said that was a 5-4-1 defending deep cross ball goes in the Germans have just lacked in that central striking position have heard starts up there tonight I'm not sure that's his favorite position I know he plays there for Chelsea well this corner looks as though it's going to be swung in by round now with RB Leipzig after his move in the summer round hits this very very deep towards the back post habits actually peeled away there tried to bring it down with his left foot but couldn't get a touch couldn't get a clean touch and he's buffered it off the ball and England bring it forward with John Stones who looks to thread a pass century that was a good pass to Sterling over the halfway line and then Sterling tried to play through to Fordham's run I think he might have been offside anyway as it is a German defender blocked it and that's a poor touch by Kane and Germany are able to clear it away on the edge of the box through Schrotter Beck and Eric Dyer then challenges in the centre circle but England have got it back yeah and that's when they have looked dangerous in the early stages England counter-attack and Stones with that tantalizing left foot crossfield pass just got there Sterling cut inside Fordham had made his run a little bit too early German high line that's Chris Sutton with us and Ross Townsend is here as well another England international Nick Pope is caught in possession and the ball bounces for Germany on the edge of the box and back it comes to Gundewan who hits the shot from the edge of the D just tried to whip it curled into the top corner but too high with the the shot by two or three feet but Nick Pope caught in possession he did he just delay took a heavy first touch in fact he was unaware of Havertz I think it was he put him under pressure the shot from Gundewan just over the bar but doesn't instill you with great confidence Nick Pope with the ball at his feet so why not Ramstail tonight why why you pop again I think it's a it's a strange call in many respects but a call which is saying to me Nick Pope you're my number two so Ramstail Ramstail's better with his feet than Nick Pope significantly but Ramstail did start the two matches the second two matches in in June in this competition against Italy in Hungary at Mollin new but Nick Pope's been selected for both of these here's Rice gets the ball down gives it a sterling on the left wing sterling is up against Kimmich out there actually got past Kimmich but then there was the covering challenge coming in from Tilo Kera and the ball bounces I would play for a Throin to England near the corner flag on the left hand side in front of all of those German flags that are dripped over the first few seats in that section in that corner actually the Throins got to be taken more towards the middle of the half sure we're now to play there but sure that's preferentially stopped him didn't he to say take it higher up yeah normally the other way around no sterling gives it back to Kane then Kane's return pass but he was blocked by Kera who actually just turns into no particular pressure and puts the ball out of play for another England throw down the left hand side this is seven or eight yards away from the corner flag uh yeah Stuart just hands the ball to Shaw who again takes it probably six or seven yards away from where it actually went out sterling now in the box Rice is there as well back to uh and the offside flag is up against Luke Shaw who'd come back from an offside position that was all rather odd yeah that that's the the assistant with the the light flag that infuriates people doesn't around the country with the late flag for offside it didn't look like it was offside well in fact yeah we're getting infuriated already tonight we've only played 12 minutes England nil Germany nil and very few empty seats around Wembley Stadium I guess it'll be early 80 000 as the ball is played down the left hand side but it's beyond sterling and it runs out of play and it's a throwing to the Germans halfway inside their own half in actual fact Germany will play a game before their opening match at the World Cup the Germans in a group with Japan Spain and Costa Rica but because they're one of the latest starters in the World Cup they've been able to organize a game on the Wednesday before so they'll play in muscat against a man on the Wednesday and then they'll fly to Qatar because you have to be in the country five days before you play so the Germans will have a friendly match before the real thing begins but not England this is the end of the meaningful action for garros southgate and his team still England nil Germany nil and rather like the other night in Milan very few opportunities for the opening goal so far here is Gundawan he's had the the shot over the top of the English crossbar Gundawan gets it back looks over his shoulder and then he lifts a ball for that was very Manchester City style but England are able to deal with that on the edge of the box and he has Maguire now on the left hand side who clears but that's blocked down and now Maguire recovers and is able to put a foot in and block it out for another corner for the Germans yeah Maguire in the first instance trying to make the clearance it was blocked and there's a ball broke free in the wide area Maguire got a good block on recovered well well round took the first corner that Germany had from over there on the right hand side but this is going to be kimmick instead so this is an out swinger is it Germany play from right to left as we look from the dressing room side of the ground in the first half kimmick raises his right arm and then fires this into the back post it's over the top of habits it's headed back across the England penalty area Maguire headed it away not a further away by bearing him on the edge of the box a stretching header as he moved backwards by Harry Kane and then it's volleyed forwards into the centre circle by Rehan Sterling but the Germans are back in possession and the central defender Schubert gives it back to Gunduan who is behind him in Germany are able to assume possession of the ball again inside England territory. We're in about 80,000 people but Wembley very very quiet because they haven't seen anything yet to get them off their seats from England here's kimmick kimmick back to Schlotterbeck and then back in the centre circle Nicholas Zula to the right hand side it goes Kara the new West Ham signing playing it right back tonight Gunduan plays it in to the edge of the area but Bellingham dives forward and blocks that out actually well the referee spotted a foul by it was uh James on round who made a run on the inside of Rhys James this was off the ball yeah and uh and James bought round down and protested to the referee I don't know whether he's got a little heads up from one of the assistants there but this is a that's a good spot by the referee that I mean that was not in his eye line that was off the whether that was him who spotted it or whether you know an assistant has made that decision but good range this isn't it what 23 24 yards out well that's it that's it that's a cheap free free kick to concede by Rhys James a little naive you might say but this is left of centre and I've seen Gunduan be able to hit them from here Leroy Zane is there as well Zane is making it look as though it's going to be him to take this but this could easily be Gunduan with the with the right foot so this is going to be a test for Nick Taub England have put up a uh a five man wall a someone lying down behind it as well but there's also a four man German wall to the right as we look of the uh of the England wall and actually England have put two men behind the German wall looks like there's three walls there John all in all and also the man lying behind as well so it is Zane who will take and he hits it into the middle of the the wall to the left well the biggest wall the biggest wall yeah and then uh England bring it away and James his trip and it's a free kick to England half being saved around half and actually that seems to have woken up a few other crowd be the wall yeah the wall just standing firm and doing their job and the crowd are excited what how many minutes are we in now we are 17 minutes in stadium buzzing I don't think I've got quite that far England nil Germany nil once we've played 20 minutes we'll bring in Andros Townsend I think for a little thought on what's happened but there's not a great deal for Andros to analyze at this stage of the game but it is a free kick that England have near the centre circle that eric Dyer will wander forward to take I don't I don't think we're surprised by the way Gareth has set up you know they're set up to defend deep and counter against the German team who want to dominate the ball this is a German team who even though they've won only one of their last six matches as I mentioned that defeat on Friday night against Hungary that was Hansy Flick's first defeat as the as the manager of Germany of the national team champions league winning coach with Bayern Munich that's spectacular but relatively brief spell that he had in charge of Bayern Munich and losing his first match out of 14 after winning the first eight he has Tess Steggen with the ball in front of his penalty area Tess Steggen just knocking the ball two or three yards in front of himself and then over hitting the ball downfield that Nick Polk should deal with at the other end which he does just picks it up so England nail Germany nail BBC Radio 5 live and BBC sounds tomorrow night more nations league commentary with rather more on the line in the nations league as Scotland go for promotion to League A so our team will be in Krakow in Poland for Ukraine against Scotland you'll be hearing that if you're listening to five live this time tomorrow night ball played over the top four Germany he has Havertz on the right hand side one of the players in the German team not necessarily in the best of form with Chelsea at the start of this season ball headed forward for Sterling who nods it down and then it's taken up by Bellingham two Germans both of the central midfielders Gündewan and Kimmich catch Bellingham at the same time and it's a pre-kick for England inside their own half what about the theory Chris this this promising pair race in Bellingham might be even better if there were three of them in that central midfield area what have you made of the partnership between them so far look I thought Bellingham performed well the other evening in Italy I really did I think Declan Rice start of the season has been okay but I think his role is key in this England team he has to really move the ball really quickly in Sicef passes passes which we haven't seen really in an England jersey Schoes giving it away and it was given to Gündewan now on the right hand side comes back in field towards Kimmich Kimmich chips it from right to left headed away by James on the edge of the box and Phil Forden is there on the edge of his own penalty area plays it back to Stones and Pope had to clear very quickly there it was slightly under hit by Stones but Pope was quick quickly enough onto it and just right footed it rattled it away downfield I think it was Hoffman who Stones was completely unaware of Hoffman as the ball was popped back to him he had a blind pass back to Nick Pope he fortunately got his big right boot to it Harry Maguire just glances ahead across the penalty area and Schoes will clear it away towards the halfway line 20 minutes played then England nail Germany nail and Drostan Zenders here with us what have you what have you thought so far and I think it's clear that in the first 20 minutes this England side have picked up where they left off the other night not much attacking threat yes with the ball at his feet so I thought I better come in there and Ross but he's been able to take a touch and clear it away carry on yeah not much attacking threat defended very well as a unit as a collective not really given much space to this German side had a few counter attacking moments but again in isolation when the when the front three or the front five a counter attacking the back three aren't getting up high enough which isn't allowing us to then sustain attacks in in in in the German defensive half and yeah we're allowing them to get out but I'd like to see more combinations between our front three which we didn't get the other night we've seen one or two signs but not much to write home about no that sums it up very well James still playing it at the left hand side kinect is there on the edge of the box though to clear away and gunned a one is able to pass it back to his goal keep at Tess Deggen who pulls it on with left foot and finds the pass to the halfway line Havertz was onto that Zanne as well but then Eric Dyer back in position half winside his own half gives it to John Stones on the right hand side Stones ball forward looking for Bellingham that's headed down by Zula who hasn't quite got it away Foden was after it shot a bit with a touch Gundawan is in there as well it's bounced to Kain Kain right side of the penalty area Bellingham wants it short in fact Kain gives it to James and then in comes a very good challenge by left back round and Germany are off on the counter attack Zanne to Muziala Muziala could have gone long with the pass instead he goes square Hoffman now takes it on gets his head down up the right wing he goes into the England left back position Hoffman's cross to the back post it's turned back in field by round comes to round again and then a stretch away from McGuire to safety and the ball's out of play and England under pressure there England nil Germany nil halfway through the first half here at Wembley Stadium and it's time for Ian Dennis to halftime thank you John that all comes from Rhys James losing the ball there and that will do who wonders from McGuire I thought it was a timely intervention from in his penalty area England not missing out on the marketing opportunity to wear their away strip at home in the new kit they all red playing from left to right as we look against Germany in their white shirts with that broad black stripe going down the middle and it is nil nil on BBC Radio 5 Live there have been a couple of nervy moments for for Pope with the ball at his feet but apart from that England have certainly defended a lot better than they did if you think back to the opening 10 minutes quite a nervy start in Milan on Friday night Germany have a throw on this near side the left 10 yards in round to take it arcs its way in headed out by stones picked up by Rhys on the edge of his penalty area held up though by by Hoffman and then McGuire plays the ball forward and then it's laid back and now England can come forward and it's a ball through the middle looking towards Raheem Sterling Sterling enters the penalty area Sterling saved by the goalkeeper to Steggen cut back onto his left foot about 12 yards out from goal central position and to Steggen making the save all in blue away towards his right hand side by far the best opportunity of the game nil nil and what a pass this is I think it's Luke Shaw who hits the pass from from deep and it's curled around the back of the German defense and Raheem Sterling right hand side of the box chops onto his left foot tries to feed the ball into the far corner what a save that is Sterling with a layoff Foden towards Harry Kane it's played behind him and Kara the right back the West Ham United defender on the cover tucks in turns it behind for a corner kick but two really promising bits of play for England in the space of 60 seconds important clearance from Kara but Phil Foden should have taken greater care with his cross because Harry Kane would have had the easiest opportunities six yards out level with the near post poor pass from Phil Foden John scorn set piece so for England corner kick near side the right James to take it right armour loft in it comes now right footed was actually flicked on by John Stones in a way but Bellingham will keep that ball in play over on that far side the brush your Dortmund midfielder inside towards Raheem Sterling who turns links up once again with Bellingham and then it's taken off his toes by Hoffman and it's gone behind for another corner kick by far England's best spell of the game 26 minutes play goalie yeah and I suppose you know with the lack of goals in the last five games it's those moments when you have those opportunities just to be a bit more careful with that final ball and Foden missing Harry Kane all about those fine margins as the corner kick from the left hand side heavy goal it's by Kane comes back to Kane and with a dipping balling from the right hand side of the penalty area he hit it first time right footed and it drops probably about half a foot wide of that left hand post as we look 0-0 I mean this is such wonderful technique from Harry Kane as the ball dropping what would he be 14 yards out at an angle trying to dip the ball back over Ter Stegen into the far corner he wasn't far away a yard past Ter Stegen's right hand post when you're having great fun with John and he was talking about the various walls I'm surprised you never said it's a wall of silence because at the time Wembley was quite quiet but they've certainly been livened up with those England efforts three of them in rapid fire time but it's Germany now who are coming forward and the ball from the central defender Nico Schlotterbeck given away Gundelwander will have it back for Germany who's right of the centre circle he's also a kimmick now for for Germany waits plays it forward Hoffman able to turn out to Kera on the right goes square along the ground kimmick with Bellingham behind him Gundelwander every outfield player is in the England half away towards our left hand side as now it's Zula a burly figure of the central defender of Germany he's lost it now with Wussi Arla and Kane to Sterling ladies off it was a heavy touch a very heavy touch from Raheem Sterling but once again that front three of Kane Sterling of Foden were looking to try and profit yeah and when Germany do overturn the ball that's when England have looked at their most dangerous but on the break there Kane into Sterling in a central position a really poor touch as Sterling just tried to cushion the ball to Phil Foden who've made a good run on the right hand side Sterling frustrated with himself England remember who haven't scored in their last three successive matches for the first time since 2000 you have to go back to 1981 the only time in England's history where they fail to score in four successive games here is Gundelwander kimmick switches play round left back closed down by James runs away off the shins of the Chelsea defender with those games against in 1981 Romania Brazil Wales and Scotland that won't indeed you see your friends north of the border unless you were talking about the Welsh that won't indeed you're six six partner Robbie Savage talking about Brazil here is Gundelwander tries to slide it in low Ron Greenwood was the other manager back then for for England here kimmick round Gundelwander pace of the game has slowed down considerably Germany will see a lot of the ball England have dropped off everybody behind it Gundelwander able to turn six yards forward of the centre circle coffins in a central area gives the ball away Bellingham can't hold on to it comes back to Gundelwander slides it through and then Hamerts mis controls the ball England managed to get away with that carer though is back forward for Germany on that far side the right and he slips the ball on the inside now to a to Hoffman and then Kara dives inside the penalty area looking for a penalty now that is where you're wanting your referee to take action I mean there there isn't a slight clip isn't there outside the box from Stirling but it's an exaggerated dive absolutely he's so much better than that Kara I knew you were going to say that ball played away by Tishtegen Gundelwander on the edge of his penalty area now we've been playing for half an hour here at Wembley on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds and tomorrow incidentally England's under 21s against Germany's under 21s will be streamed live on the BBC the red button the BBC iPlayer as well as the BBC Sport website that's at Bramble Lane is here we are at Wembley in north London where it is still goalless Mussiala round the left back for Germany to Schlotterbeck inside to Gundelwander in between the two central defenders he has the ball now and now it's with Zula just edging his way forward Hoffman to Kimmich short diagonal ball back towards Hoffman creates the overlap for the run of Kara first time cross cleared by Stirling for for England and now Germany starting to sit a little bit more of the ball yeah England happy to defend deep don't have a great deal of pace with those three central defenders in Germany a bit of joy in the wide air is just watching the Stirling and Kara incident again there is a slight tug of the jersey from Rehm Stirling but it's the exaggeration Deno which we can't stand I think it's fair to say Paul van Borkel who's the VAR the Dutch official would have no doubt had a look at that from his Dutch counterpart Danny Makalie the referee was Kara inside to Kimmich back with the the German midfielder once again it's almost being played at a walking pace this contest that is set 0-0 round forward back to Schlotterbeck Gundelwan once again the black armband is just coming loose there of Gundelwan managed to reattach it however still with the ball at his feet and now Zula along the ground and the ball goes away might reach round but James was alert back towards Pope first time clearance stumble from the Newcastle goalkeeper headed forward by Gundelwan against his Manchester City teammate Phil Foden and now it's with that with Dyer plays it forward Bellingham Germany trying to press stones along the ground Foden lays it off towards Bellingham England though can't get out of their own half at the moment back it goes towards stones Havertz loitering back towards Pope first time clearance a lot of distance on that flipped on by the head of Kane Sterling Schlotterbeck and Kara between them deal with that bouncing ball midway through the Germany half here is Sane challenge made by James comes out to round left corner of the area delivers the cross headed out first time by Dyer picked up by Gundelwan this is Kimmich running to the edge of the area checked back onto his left foot chips the ball in towards the penalty area and it's over the head of Mussiala in the other group by the way group A3 Hungary who had a two point advantage over Italy Raspidori who scored against England the other night in the San Siro has given Roberto Mancini side the lead that would take Italy to the top and go through to the finals venue for those finals will be totally decided for the next UEFA executive committee who meet on October the 27th but Italy looking to try and pit Hungary to the top of England's group of course England have already been relegated and will the 2024 competition will be in the second tier 34 minutes played 11 minutes to go to halftime get another word from there from Andros who's alongside us here before the the break is Gundelwan picks it up plays the ball forward headed away by by stones and then James has lost the ball to round the left back now it's with Mussiala and Mussiala was looking to try and get on that ball there on the edge of the area here is stones there with interception towards Foden and Foden can run forward Cain having to check his run stones just pulled up there looking towards sterling through the goalkeeper he's got a big problem there John Stones was looking to make a running behind the German high line he's gone down I'm not a medical expert they know but that's a right hand string Foden was looking towards sterling but whilst that was happening stones has pulled up and he sat down and he's now just on the halfway line and doesn't look like he's going to be in a position to continue so let's bring in Andros what have you you made of the game in Andros so far 10 minutes to go to halftime yeah again we've had our moments and spells initially straight after that 20 minute period we had a few attacks back to back we've managed to stay in their half for a few minutes which I haven't seen in the last definitely in the last 100 minutes of football that I've been watching England play including the other night but still I feel like when we're counter attacking it's too isolated where Declan Rice making a marauding run sterling's got in a few times we're not backing up the play there's too much space between those counter attacking and those behind the two midfielders need to get higher the three centre halves I know they're worried about their pace but they need to get higher as well we need to get some sustained possession in this German half and we're not doing that at the minute as Andros town's ends England international and here is Chris Sutton I mean it's very basic England's brand of football that you know that's the truth I mean when the ball goes back to Nick Pope he kicks the ball up the pitch Harry Kane tries to flick it on and Raheem Sterling makes a movement off him and but where England have been dangerous is in the turnover and when they've counterattacked and and you know it's just been that final ball at times but England haven't really found a way of playing out from the back through this German team who are pressing high but even if you are going to play that way it is very basic if you are going to play up to Harry Kane and try and get flip-bombs and try and get a knockdown if your two midfielders are on the halfway line they're never going to pick up the bits so then Germany win it back straight away and they're attacking us again and then we retreat back to our back to our shape in our own half so yes it's one thing playing basic playing up to Harry Kane but if you haven't got the runners off him or behind him back from him up you're not going to get any joy at all. John Stone's unable to continue and the way that he pulled up you would think that it'd be a doubt for the Manchester Derby a game incidentally you can hear live on Sunday afternoon on BBC Radio 5 live seven appearances for Manchester City five starts in the Premier League as well this season for for John Stones so a doubt ahead of the the Manchester Derby and he's replaced by his Manchester City teammate Kyle Walker that was one of two changes from the side that lost to Italy on Friday made by by Gareth Southgate so Kyle Walker comes on for his 70th cap for England tonight to play on the right side of that three-man defence talking of City, Gundewan, Stutterbeck with the cross headed away by Shaw who hasn't played in the Premier League for Manchester United since that defeat at Brentford he's actually had less game time for United than Harry Maguire here is Bellingham charging forward for the red of England to Sterling, Shaw's going to go on the overlap Sterling carries the ball forward now he utilises Shaw and the cross is charged down and deflected behind for a corner kick and it remains 0-0 with seven minutes to go to halftime and that attack stemmed from a wonderful pass from Phil Foden brave for 30 yards from his own goal little reverse pass in England once again looking at danger on the counter attack can they make something in this corner? Corner kick far side to left Phil Foden to take it left footed it's an out swing at Maguire climbs 12 yards out from goal but his header drops well off target England's highest scoring defender makes his way back into defences to Steggen tries to take the quick goal kick but Shaw was alert in a central area and the two wing backs for England combined passing the ball there and now it's back with with Clow Walker once more for for England Rice now with Dyer almost coming to a standstill at the heart of that England defence and then Maguire from the left of the three spreads play out towards James nicely controlled first time Bellingham with Gundogan looking to close him down goes back and then Dyer backpedaling manages to clear the ball up towards that far side and it's with with Shaw back towards his Manchester United teammate Maguire and England in turn all the way back to the goalkeeper Pope in yellow clears with a diagonal ball James looks to attack it heads it on high on the chest by Foden looking to turn surrounded by too many white shirts and Germany back in possession Kimmich strokes it forward round makes the run in behind on this near side the Germany left plays it now back to Nico Schlottebeck who Borussia Dortmund central defender up against his teammate of course Jude Bellingham way waving the team up waving England's back line up there's not a lot of pace in that back line other than Karl Walker who has come on here is Gundogan Germany now being forced back this is with with Foden round for Germany Kimmich able to have a little glance around Bellingham in close proximity back towards his goalkeeper controls the ball in his six yard area but his right foot of clearance over the head of carer because of England's presence Germany give the ball away it'll be in England throw with four and a half minutes to go but apart from that flurry of activity with with England they had two or three moments of genuine excitement and Pope's nervy moments that's been about it in terms of a spectacle had the sterling opportunity wonderful pass from Shaw and sterling actually chopped inside didn't he really big opportunity with his weaker left foot decent save from test it test again is it a good pass though the quiet to Shaw flicks it forward along the ground left hand side of the penalty area sterling goes to ground waggle the finger from the referees there's no foul Shaw wins it back to Foden couldn't control the ball on the edge of the area and Zulu will play it up towards the Gundogan Bellingham coming across gets the foot into the challenge but Germany will still come forward over on that far side with Mussiala on the Germany left lays it back to Gundogan coming on to the ball left of the center circle and now it's left towards Kimmich who passes the ball out towards that far side and Havertz just drifting in off that right touch line now with Kimmich 30 yards from goal still 0-0 as we approach halftime on BBC Radio 5 line Sane Gundogan Kimmich wants more over the top of Hoffman and Shaw will easily come across and deal with that and then runs it out of play for a throw doesn't deal with that very well he did initially well he didn't in the end because he was careless and the ball went out for a German throwing Kera right hand side threads it through Mussiala first cross was blocked right hand side of the penalty area cuts it back right corner of the area to Kimmich Kimmich waits to deliver the ball that was blocked by Dyer and out of play it goes for a throw down by the corner flag over on that far side the Germany right and it remains England nil Germany nil when John said at the start of the game the reaction throughout tonight from this sellout crowd at Wendley will be quite telling we'll get a flavor of what the supporters have felt with this first 45 minutes when Danny Macaulay does indeed blow his halftime whistles the cross comes in from the right an excellent the defended by Carl Walker just chest in the ball back towards Nick Pope yeah really cool wasn't it Carl Walker only have it's really in the middle for Germany Walker what six yards from goal just cushioned chest back to Nick Pope who eventually clears the ball away it's flicked on by the head of James Foden makes the running behind hooks it in field laid off by the chest of Kane James spins away from Gwendolyn lays it off to Bellingham turns into trouble in Mousiala loses the ball break on now for Germany Kimmich out towards Hoffman have it's going on ahead of him Hoffman with his short dark hair nutmegs rise stepping out of defense with McGuire out towards Sterling forward ball now towards Harry Kane England now looking to counter Sterling ahead of Kane enters the penalty area Sterling's low left-footed shot easily saved by Tishegan at his near post 0-0 brilliant once again Harry Kane his weight of pass to Raheem Sterling who is marauding into the box on the left hand side gets to run on Kera decides to shoot a goal with his left foot I think he could have squared that to Phil Foden who would have an easy tap in at the far post on a few occasions in this first half England have had opportunities to take the lead they've just been slightly careless Garry Southgate yesterday in conversation with John was saying that's where they need to be ruthless in that that final third but in the end it was easily kept out by Tishegan Neuer missing for Germany as Gwendolyn does a 360 degree turn lays the ball off to Tisula central defender for Germany was quite high there edge of the area now with that with Mussiala no sight of goal plenty of red shirts back no way through and England able to clear ball just touched forward by Bennington to Foden now it's with Raheem Sterling over the halfway line a little dart forward by Sterling the through ball to Foden was blocked comes out towards Harry Kane on that far side and back it goes towards Shaw and we're about to find out how much added on time there were playing as you may have heard it's just the two as Maguire sends the ball forward Harry Kane has done no I was about to say exceptionally well to keep it in he was like a ball juggler there teetering down the touch line but it's gone out of play and it'll be a Germany throw the ball juggler I know what you meant but yeah he didn't keep it in so he did juggle with the ball yeah but it doesn't count does it if it's not on stage back with Tishtegen and now with that with Zula to here the Germany goalkeeper Declan Rice has gone into press Gundewin looks like Ter Stegen no so good with the ball at his feet Ter Stegen Schlotterbeck tests out that footwork once more of the Germany goalkeeper to Zula there is a hush around Wembley Stadium as Hoffman now picks up the ball plays it out towards that far side the right to to Kara which had an interesting time since he's moved to to West Ham United an own goal against Tottenham conceding a penalty against Brighton and Hobalbein this Kimmick to Kara forward back towards Kimmick once again a little bit off balance that ball inside to Kimmick but it's kept alive by Schlotterbeck Gundewin this is Musiala edge of the area accelerates couldn't find a way through comes out to Schlotterbeck on this left hand side Gundewin edge of the area 30 yards out Kimmick's gonna shoot right footed close there's a low right footed effort just under 30 yards out along the ground Pope fully extended away towards his right but as we look it was off target from the left hand post and behind for a goal kick nil nil in stoppage time the England defense very deep couple of yards inside the box and now he's sterling the closest man to Kimmick who shoots from a central area so he doesn't really shut him down and he's not far away Kimmick decent strike I don't give him too many shooting opportunities the reaction from tonight's game will be live if not before we're off air at 10 o'clock into Colin Murray's program that follows five live sports at 10 but the halftime whistle has sounded it's England nil Germany nil England had a couple of nervy moments for Nick Pope in goal and that low effort for Kimmick but apart from that the best spell was when Harry Kane had an effort that was off target and sterling with a obviously left foot brought out a save from from to Steggen in a flurry of activity but that's probably been about it as far as the goal mouth incidents are concerned and so mark a halftime England nil Germany nil you're still awake and Ross we've had our moments we've had our moments it's not been too bad that was just talking about it's listen to Chris I said no if you it's there's no intensity is that I mean from either side really it's all a bit a bit flat I think from from the German side they've had the lion's shell possession but they've not really troubled us at all they've not really dragged us out of position they've not gone down the side of us they've not gone over us they've not gone in behind us so I think from an England side even though we're not seeing large amounts of the ball I think we're very comfortable and where we're catching them on the counterattack we're very dangerous we're creating chances but we just need to be like the guy I said in commentary we need to be more clinical because we're not getting there as often as we would like Chris yeah I think there's an element of you know we we knew the way Gareth would set up how he sets up against the the better teams and it is to counterattack I think the truth is from the first half is you know as Andrew said Nick Pope hasn't really had anything to do in terms of shot stopping and there haven't been any big opportunities for the Germans if anything England have just been slightly wasteful when they have had opportunities the fold and cross where he has to find Kane I mean you know massive opportunity Sterling went through and you know it's a good save from from Ter Stegen came is a bit unlucky with uh with the volley there have been moments but England just have to be clinical in those moments and that's the story of the first half but I don't think that we it's not going to happen under Gareth for England to go toe to toe with the big nations and play an expansive uh brand of football it's not going to happen we have to accept what we are and you know it's been basic football at times Nick Pope hasn't taken any chances after he made an error early on and he's been like walloping balls up to Harry Kane who's trying to flick the ball on but where England have looked danger dangerous is uh is in the turnover when they've won the ball from Germany when Germany are throwing bodies forward and they have countered England have been a threat it's just they haven't been clinical enough Andross Chris thank you very much second half on the way here on Five Live Sport that's a good thing that's meant to keep you listening we'll talk Worcester and Ukraine Scotland during halftime after the latest BBC News Listen on

from the Singapore Grand Prix Sunday afternoon from one on BBC radio five sports extra listen on BBC sounds this is five live sport with Mark Chapman England nail Germany nail a half time second half on the way now in rugby union today Worcester Warriors have been suspended from playing and will be put into our administration after failing to meet an RFU funding ultimatum we can hear from Nick Easton now a defense coach at the club it's obviously been a horrific situation the last the last five weeks six weeks over long it's been going on for but personally you know I know there's a lot of other people in a lot worse situation I am now that doesn't make it easier but you know it's been you know a lot of mental torment and torture and it's probably born out of yes look not the situation that we signed up for and we thought that the club would be in but rather the fact that the communication and lack of answers and the complete uncertainty which is probably what concerns you the most whereas when you have good communication lines and there's a bit of certainty whichever way it may be you can move forward and I suppose the announcements in the last hour or two hours or whatever it might be have provided a bit of that we've got a call later on tonight you know as coaches and management so I'll find out a little bit more about what's going on. Minti because it's been broken deadline after broken deadline there's been no visibility in person if I'm to believe everything that I've seen on Twitter with regards to the new owners you shared your frustration online too but as from today and I'm sure you get more clarity when you have your call what is your stance what is your position currently suspended from the Gallagher Premiership your employer coach players every single day but there is no competition. Yeah so as far as I'm concerned and the club's concerned Steve Dimes decided on Saturday told the management before the game told the players after the game we'd have to week off he said there's no point coming in because the other thing is the building now is an insured so it's been closed as of 4.30 this afternoon even the caretaker and his wife have been kicked out which is their accommodation for however long they've been there yeah I mean that's our appalling the whole situation is and the you know the lack of honesty and care that's gone into the situation to be honest with you so we can't train there so yeah look if we carried on training we might have to go on to a local school or a club or a field or something but I just don't think that does anyone any good so he's giving everyone the week off as far as that's concerned. I mean over the last few weeks being as you've said it's been really uncertain has the rugby been the gel between it all just keeping people together I know it doesn't mean much right now but you had a great result and sometimes rugby can bring the best of our people in that way has it done that in this situation? Yeah look at least it gives you something to focus on doesn't it for the time you're training and obviously the lads playing and you know us as coaches I suppose and the supporters just get behind the boys and they've all been fantastic and it gives you an outlet you know it's obviously an incredibly physically demanding game so your frustrations and anger and what other emotions you're feeling you know gives you an outlet but it can only go so far can't it really? Yeah we want to keep everyone on coaches and what I say but I mean Dimes you know he's obviously in charge of the rugby side has said that you know he wants to keep everyone on but he won't stand in a way of people don't want to leave and I think a small amount of people have asked whether they can leave I think it's you know their minds aren't made up I'm pretty sure well actually I know that everyone is committed to wanting to stay but obviously it gets to a point doesn't it where you can't just carry on being led down the garden path and something needs to happen and as I'll repeat you know now with the suspension and now the administration will be a lot closer to finding out what does happen. It's a must listen every week is the rugby union weekly this week more so than ever plenty more with Nick Easter with Hugo and Chris Ashton on the pod and the full episode will be out later tonight on BBC Sands. Now tomorrow night we've got live commentary of Scotland's Nations League decider against Ukraine in Poland Alistair Bruce Ball is there. Yes welcome to the beautiful city of Krakow in Southern Poland Pat Nevin and I have flown over today with a fair few blue-shirted, bequilted Scotland fans if that's a term I'm not sure it is they're hoping their team can get at least a point against Ukraine in our commentary game on Tuesday night to win group B1 of the Nations League we'll hear from the Scotland boss Steve Clark in a moment who's been talking ahead of the game. Pat Scotland obviously off the back of an excellent win against Ukraine last week but unfortunately Steve Clark is missing a lot of players and not just plays key players for this one. He has made a mistake of speaking in five live last week about the fact that we've got lots and lots of fillbacks I shouldn't have opened my mouth we've got hardly any left yet with so many injuries but really important ones obviously we knew a Robertson was out beforehand but it's certainly a big one for Cairnti and it'd be missing but maybe even more so and if you look down the line of centre backs that were missing just now Grant Hanley and Cooper were out before but McKenna missing as well so you're talking about an entire back lane almost it's been repped out of the team. Okay let's hear from the boss and one of his strikers ahead of the game so Pat's mentioned it some of the names missing Scott McTomonay as well actually suspended but Scott McKenna's key at the back Cairnti and one of the latest as well to withdraw from the squad Shay Adams now a doubt as well we're actually going to hear from him straight after we have heard from Steve Clark. It's actually disappointing because you don't want to lose any players from the squad at Cairnti and Scott to good players playing to the best of their ability but as I always say injuries are sent to test you there's now a chance for someone else. One or two missing from training this morning we've got some kind of virus in the camp just sickness so when the Dyches Shay Adams couldn't train this morning they didn't feel very well but they'll be on the plane so we've got that to worry about as well so we're not short of issues and we're also not short of determination to go there and finish the job. Now I feel great you know I trained this morning and feeling better but I think it's just that you know it's one of them mornings where we have to get through it and so I can play I think yeah I think if it was any worse than that I think I couldn't but you know I'm fit and I'm ready to go. Yeah there's been a few injuries you know but I think that's that comes from boys putting their bodies on the line and you know wanting to do well for the nation so I think yeah it's been tough but you know brought some other players in and I think we've had a good two games in this campaign and I think we just have to end it well now I think you know everyone wants to do well and everyone show how good we are as a team so it's just you know getting over that final line tomorrow. So those are the thoughts of the Scotland striker Shay Adams before him the manager Steve Clark Pat do you think there'll be a temptation given the players missing and given the fact that a point is enough to sit back and play for the point? I think he might be tempted to try and play three at the back problem is he's not got three it's a real difficult inform but he'll really have to think imaginatively but that's one thing that Steve Clark's good at he's had to adapt it and time's gone past and it's kind of worked so you know I'm really intrigued to know what he's going to do system wise personnel wise and I could almost not guess just now. Pat and Ali and Joel here more from them from seven o'clock tomorrow all the build-up and then the game in full with us one other football line not the first time that I've said this on Five Lives Sport. Watford have a new manager Slamm and Billage has signed an 18 month deal after Rob Edwards was the latest one to be sacked by the club we will have reaction to tonight's England game on the football daily podcast which you'll be able to download later on via BBC Sands and don't forget the rugby union weekly one will be up a little bit later on we're waiting for the second half to get underway at Wembley, Goalless at halftime, Andros Tansen what do you want to see more of in the second half? Definitely more in the final third more creativity more linking up but I think like Chris said earlier we've created the chances created four or five good chances just the final ball needs to be a bit more clinical when you're playing the low block you know you're not going to get that many chances but when you do get in the final third you need to make it count. Would you switch the wide men round Andros at all so they're playing on their natural side? No I think they're more comfortable I know nowadays the left footer plays on the right and the right footer plays on the left so I think they're both comfortable where they are they're both creating it's just I know it's rich it's very rich coming from me but it's just the the final ball is just that end product which is missing. So you've heard from Andros Chris is alongside him second half maybe has just got underway cool I don't want to miss a second of this sorry John Murray. He's very naughty isn't Mark Chapman. Second half begins here at Wembley Stadium on this dry September night England 0 Germany 0. Germans have made a change Timo Werner once of Chelsea is onto the field now he's taken the place of Jonas Hoffman who was quite quiet I must say on the right hand side so Werner who's done well actually since he's gone back to RB Leipzig this season has already scored four goals Werner is on we'll just see where he's going to play if he's going to play through the middle which I suspect he will as Germany win a free kick inside their own penalty area he is isn't he Chris Sutton he's he's got the number nine on his back and he's playing through the middle up front Werner. Yeah and Havards just dropping into that number 10 roll towards the Germans and they're getting onto that ball and Werner backing in but like why winning it wouldn't that have been a lovely had England scored after 10 seconds and Chapman would have missed it. Well they didn't so England in the red shirts with the the blue trim this is the new the new kit with the the old style collar the navy blue collar and Germany in the white shirts big black stripe down the front of those shirts black shorts and white socks and in the first start in the second half England playing from right to left as they did when they scored the two goals here at the Euros in the last 16 and beat Joachim Lürf's Germany as they were at the time offside flag against England. That's really bad from Luke Shaw the Shaw left wing back Declan Rice he got a long 40-yard ball from the centre of the pitch to Shaw who made a run in behind but he's looking across the line the German back line that's really poor. People haven't rushed back to their seats for the start of the second half still lots and lots of empty red seats people still coming in the exit the entrances and here is Werner for Germany square from him Kimmich Kimmich is onto this 30 yards out slips the ball through the Muziala he's got some space right side of the penalty area he pulls it back to the edge of the box but he pulls it straight to his young friend Jude Bellingham and Bellingham for England passes it forward quickly to Sterling and now Cain return pass to Sterling. Sterling's got away from Zula but the Germans are getting back in numbers Sterling on the left hand side puts his foot on the ball actually and now the Germans are all back in position and groans you can hear it from the England supporters and we'll run you through the teams again when we get a chance but England with it still inside German territory and the ball forwards towards Bellingham who plays it out to the right hand side Rhys James is there Bellingham again with a touch that's away from Fulton though and I think it will be taken up by Germany deep inside their own half it is with the back run. I think the frustration there for the England support and I get that is Sterling actually turned back when he had the run on Zula had the opportunity to go for goal but didn't back himself turned back and the chance was gone. England with Fulton he has been bright in the match Phil Fulton he's done a lot of good things now the ball square across the edge of the box to Sterling should Spurt test Deggan diving to his left is able to catch it actually leaping to his left. Yeah and it's a good run from Luke Shaw on the overlap and Kera just backs off because he's thinking about going with Shaw that allowed Sterling to come inside on his right foot and try to bend the ball into the far corner but smart goalkeeping. Germany it is now coming forward still nil and a nil on five live and BBC sounds ball out to the right hand side and Tilo Kera of West Ham playing the ball back towards the halfway line. England had to make a change during the first half blow from Manchester City John Stones seeming to have pulled a hamstring so he was replaced by Kyle Walker that's the only England change so far balls played over the top for Werner Werner Flix a foot in it but lifts it high over and in any case the offside flag is up against the blonde German number nine so the England team now Pope and goal Walker Dyer and Maguire are the three central defenders James on the right Shaw on the left Bellingham and Rice in the middle Foden and Sterling either side of Ken and the German team with Tess Deggan in goal as England have given it away to Muziala and Muziala takes on K and Maguire Muziala went down in the box there seemed to be contact and must say from my view here but the referee Danny Macaulay waved it away straight away who's having none of that in terms of it being a penalty well it's how much contact I've got to say my initial feeling was penalty there was enough contact for Muziala to go down balls out of the play now so the question is whether they're going to have a look at this on the AR they've got to look at this got to Muziala stands Maguire up little step over I mean Maguire catches him has to be a penalty it's clumsy defending from Maguire can't get his feet going that little step over there is contact here we are here we are it's Harry Maguire is going to concede a penalty here he kicked he kicked and caught Muziala on the on the ankle the ball had gone the referee is going across to have a look at the screen but the video assistant referee Paul van Virkel has called the referee over and this is an absolute certainty he's going to have a look at this and England are going to concede a penalty Harry Maguire is going to concede a penalty and there's the narrative for you right there absolutely it's unfortunate there's the rectangle from the referee booze from the crowd but he points to the penalty spot and Harry Maguire in the middle of the England half just lifts his hand to his face and walks back to his own penalty area the England players go across Declan Rice is going to have a word Harry Kane as well but it's no good the decision's been given Harry Kane just shepherds race away but it's a penalty and it's Ilkai Gundawan who's got the ball in his hands yeah and it's just Maguire who gives the ball away to Muziala plays a little square ball Maguire tries to find short Muziala pinches the ball and drives up Maguire clumsy challenge there's a penalty and it's a poor poor error from Maguire what a chance for the Germans to take the lead well Gundawan has still got the ball in his hands and there's still general milling around but Harry Maguire is going to be the focus having been involved England losing possession Maguire involved in that then Maguire conceding the penalty so it's Nick Paul Newcastle United's Nick Paul dancing around on his line Ilkai Gundawan right footed slots it away Paul went down to his left but couldn't get that very good penalty by the Manchester City midfielder and England are behind at Wembley in this final match before they head to the World Cup and Cata England on this five-match run without a win a one-nil down to the Germans here at Wembley yeah good penalty from Gundawan Pope actually stands up I think he thinks Gundawan is going down the middle Gundawan just slides the ball into Pope's left hand side just looking at this challenge again from Maguire in your right John that's the narrative why does Garith Southgate persist with Harry Maguire doesn't get enough club football the ball passed from him initially it's going to be hung out to dry here isn't he well as a football manager you in metaphorical terms you live and die by your decisions and Harry Maguire and the Fray just conceded that penalty and Germany lead England by one goal to nil so now they have to respond England to a searching for a goal right to the left hand side shore curls it across chested down by Bellingham but it bounces away now there are big appeals for a handball there from the England players Kane and Bellingham are saying that it struck a German arm the referee's having nothing to do with that either he's leaving that to be a R England come forward again but concede a free kick so this is a question of whether Paul van Buurkel is going to call the referee to have a look at that must say with the naked eye it wasn't obvious but we are now seeing it Chris as the ball came into the box oh it's uh it's Bellingham and round I don't say handball yeah there's no handball I think the England forwards clutching their wanting a decision which clearly wasn't there but now England they've sat in first half haven't they encountered got to take some initiative and take the game to Germany they have a precious situation in the nation's league this game that is effectively a dead rubber really as the balls played back to pulp who clears long towards the halfway line in the context of the nation's league there's really very little resting on this match England have already relegated Germany can't make the finals but it's important it's big for England this now it's big for England speak for Garis Southgate after his team selection Harry Maguire was at fault in the conceding of the opening goal here is Bellingham now Bellingham players have got to stand up to the moment stand up to the occasion Kane and Sterling there too are the most experienced men now the ball is Shaw on the left hand side Shaw in the full back position the German's quickly back in position now Rice receives it on the edge of the box gives it back to Sterling on the left hand side Sterling to Maguire Maguire looks up lifts a pass right over to the far side James takes that down James now approaching the penalty area on his right foot plays it to the edge of the box and Bellingham tried to curl a shot under the crossbar but lifted it over instead by a yard or two yeah it's funny isn't it the Germans take the lead and you know one of the first times in the game England then take the initiative a couple of good passages of players the balls fed out to the right hand side James feeds a lovely ball back to Bellingham from 18 yards out edge of the box should make Ter Stegen work full sails over the bar in the other match in this group Italy now lead two nil in Budapest in the Puskas arena against Hungary and it looks as though Italy Roberto Mancini's Italy who are not going to the World Cup are going to win this group and head to the finals next year the donations lead instead free kick sure Rice is fouled on the left hand side most teammate West Ham teammate Kara with the foul so it's a free kick set piece opportunity Harry Maguire an obvious target that would be that would turn the story on its head if he's able to get that big head to the ball and put this into the net so the free kick to be taken by James from the left hand side right footed he plays it in towards Ter Stegen but he got one of those big orange gloves to it and up a cut got a good distance on that with that punch caught that beautifully almost punched it to the halfway line England with Walker the substitute the first half substitute Manchester Derby coming on Sunday that's one of our commentaries from the Premier League this weekend England get the ball away down the right hand side with James James delays the cross and then just to win a corner strikes it straight into the defender and it's behind England corner he had the opportunity though Reese James to whip the ball in first time it's 2v2 and Sterling inside the box German defenders running back towards the goal got a corner corner here's the delivery now to the near post it's a flick it bounces out belling him on the edge of the box shoots but he slipped the thing as he did so and hit a bouncing shot well wide of the right post as he looked at it just slips doesn't he belling him there a couple of decent opportunities there similar position to the one he ballooned over the bar it's not a great corner from Foden the ball for German defender just ricochets to him from 18 yards but that left standing foot slips and chance gone the score is England 0 Germany 1 an England facing the possibility of heading to the World Cup on a six match unbeaten run that would be the first time that England have gone six matches without a win for 29 years Dyer playing the ball out from the back Sterling now short the flick but it bounces out of play off the Manchester United man for a throw in on the halfway line it was Federico de Marco who scored the second goal for Italy hungry nil Italy 2 so not that it England or Germany or bothered but that's Netherlands Croatia it looks like Italy and either Portugal or Spain will be the four teams through to the the nation's league finals next year rice puts in the challenge but Verna comes out with the ball there's a slip in the box by Dyer and Verna couldn't find the pass across the penalty area and Sané was all alone almost at the far post but but Verna couldn't find the pass and that's a let-off for England and Garis Southgate could easily have been 2-0 terrible from Timo wasn't it I mean that was impossible to miss that pass the Germans would have been 2-0 and it was awful the way he just fed the ball I think it was to Dyer with two German attackers free just to tap the ball in Dyer slipped as well at the crucial moment and he was fortunate England were fortunate Germany lead 1-0 half an hour to play half an hour for England to salvage this against Germany German supporters over there boyant they'll be enjoying this question is which of these teams would go to the World Cup off the back of a morale boosting win at the moment it's Hansy Flicks Germany and here they come again and there's a low shot from the edge of the box from Zula the central defender who did well exchange the pass around the edge of the penalty area and then try to pass it into the bottom corner but hit it a couple of feet wide yeah he's comfortable though Zula when he steps in gonna sit little pass in I think it's the Musiala who's wonderful waited cushion pass back to him allows him to take another touch and he's under pressure but fires a shot not far away from Nick Popes right hand post England have lost possession again they've given it away inside their own half Gundau and then the Gwaiar puts in the challenge and the ball bounces away to Sterling near the halfway line who bounces off Kaira but Havertz is able to pick it up and Germany have just got a they've got an extra spring at the moment they've got the goal they're a goal ahead and they just have the edge over England this is where yeah they're gonna make some subs on the England but this is where England and Garith Thaisgate you feel the team have to be brave and really press the Germans high if England just sit in and the Germans dominate possession then you can see it getting ugly in here yeah you can now Pukaj or Sackare can see is being prepared to come on remember Jack Grealish is not an option Jack Grealish who came on at the Euros here and and helped it to win the game for England Grealish suspended for this match after his yellow card in the San Siro the other night and I think Jordan Henderson is being prepared down there as well Rice stretchers into the challenge Bellingham stretches into the challenge McGuire stretches into the challenge but Musiala gets away and gives it to Furner and Furner shoots low across the face of goal and beyond the far post and again England are fortunate well I'm lucky that chance felt to Timo Verna because he got the feeling because it's Timo Verna that he would miss but a couple of challenges from England players not good enough the ball slipped into Verna who has that pace to get away the England backline but then from 12 yards at the angle he's trying to slide the ball across Pope into the far corner it slides a couple of yards couple of yards wide of Nick Pope's post terrific from Musiala though I mean that was that was wonderful stuff he could easily have been playing for England tonight against Germany even though he you know he's born in Germany he was born in Stuttgart but moved to this country as a seven-year-old was at Southampton was at Chelsea actually met Gareth Southgate when he was 13 or 14 years old when he was a schoolboy when Gareth Southgate came to his school well we can't hold that against Gareth that's wonderful but real talent said it was a really tough decision but he came through the groups your friend Derek Ray put out a picture this afternoon with Bellingham and and Musiala sitting alongside each other in an England dressing room one of the young teams but Musiala he won the penalty tonight and he very nearly set Verna up for the second goal where England nil Germany won England needs something and Gareth Southgate going to make a couple of changes it's Mason Mount who is coming on with Pocayo Saka they thought saw Jordan Henderson standing up but he's not he's not coming on just yet if he is going to come on so uh two of the two of the players who've been real Gareth Southgate men hadn't they Saka and Mount if this this England team are going to be called on to see if they can help turn things around here's Eric Dyer at the back but Dyer's pasted straight the kinect and kinect chips it over the top Nick Popes come right to the edge of his box and clears it away and they left it to one another Walker and Pope and Pope in the end it didn't cross the line into the box and Pope cleared it but at the other end Foden plays it up but it bounces off Sterling and Germany will come again in the centre circle with the goal scorer Gundawan but he loses out in centrefield is club mate Thoden came back and tackled it Bellingham now to the right hand side I think that German goal the Gundawan penalty is actually making it a better game it is uh that was a nerfy moment for Nick Pope really indecisive there expecting the ball to run through to him and side is 18 yard box and then in the end a hacked clearance away Eric Dyer goes for a long diagonal pass down the right hand side to James he gets the ball under control immediately near the corner of the penalty area plays it in square but played it in short that was read so easily by Gundawan now it's headed forward though for Walker for England Harry Kane turns on the right hand side slips the ball down the right hand side it's clipped across to the near post bit headed behind by Schrotterbeck who was comfortably in the right area to head it behind and it's a corner to England from the right I don't think I'll make the double change yet but it's corner yeah it's really clean play from Harry Kane to slide the ball to Reese James but he's cross blocked can England make something Harry McGuire is calling for it McGuire and Kane standing together Thoden with the corner into the near post it's a flick and it's up and over the near post by Eric Dyer and it's a goal kick to Germany England are going to make a double substitution now. Well, Thoden is replaced Saka and Mount coming on and Raheem Sterling so Sterling and Thoden are off and Saka and Mount are on well well they sought themselves out let's bring in Andros Townsend for a word we're almost halfway through the second half Andros yeah I think the introduction of Timo Verna has completely changed the dynamic of this German front three we've said at half time how comfortable England were not really troubled and then you get someone like Verna with his pace and his willingness to run behind you get him stretching defences and all of a sudden even though he's not having joy himself he's stretching the defense and allowing the more technical players in behind him to get on the ball so yeah his introduction has really really hurt England. Thank you Andros England nailed Germany one BBC Radio 5 live 25 minutes to go what do you think Chris Thoden, Thoden and Sterling off? Yeah a little bit surprised. There's Harry Maguire left side of the penalty area Maguire still going between two Germans still going but then the challenge comes in on him and Maguire is dispossessed trying to rectify matters Havertz plays it forward to Verna Verna now Zane in the middle Verna still in possession 30 yards out he's on his right foot he plays it square to Havertz just outside the D a curling left foot shot it's in it's beyond the dive of Nick Pope Havertz scores and Germany lead here by two goals to nil and Garros Southgate stands on the edge of the coaching area it's going to be a defeat it seems to send England to the World Cup it's going to be six matches without a win and it's going to be another Nations League defeat damaging very damaging this terrible Nations League campaign and Germany now celebrate that goal that well taken goal from Kai Havertz black red and yellow flags flying in one corner of a very quiet Wembley stadium the rest of it extremely subdued England nil Germany to dare I say it was Harry Maguire who gave the ball away driving forward from England's left hand side cutting inside is dispossessed and the Germans break a great pace and as Verna with the ball across the box to Kai Havertz who's still got so much to do but 20 yards out right hand side of the box with his left foot finds the far top corner it's a brilliant finish the howitzer from Havertz into the far corner Pope no chance no way back for England another Maguire mistake and I sense it's going to get ugly in here midway through the second half here at Wembley Stadium Garros Southgate and his England team heading to another Nations League defeat England nil Germany to and for the remainder he is Ian Dennis thank you John so a double change being made there with Robin Goosens coming on and Serge Gnabry so Goosens replacing round at left back and Gnabry coming on for Sane on the left hand side for Germany as England looking for a way back into the game with a final quarter of this match remaining but trading 2-0 and a bad night for Harry Maguire culpable with both of the goals he gave away the first and then trying to win it back conceded the penalty and then losing the ball in the Germany half and then within a matter of seconds a fine curling effort as Bellingham shoots from distance but just outside the D as England all in red play from right to left right footed well positioned and a comfortable save for for Andre to Steggen it's a bit of sod's law for Harry Maguire isn't it the Havertz finish was so good such a brilliant effort to but the Germans 2-0 ahead you know normally from that range you've got to be perfect and Havertz was perfect and it's you know he can do no right can he Harry Maguire everything which he does at this moment in time is under so much scrutiny he gives the ball away on the edge of the German box and the Germans end up scoring blindly but England so far in this second half they haven't really had a passage of play where they actually look like scoring a couple of efforts from Bellingham on the edge of the box immediately after the Germans had scored took a bit of the initiative but now this is where you sense that England need to be brave here is Mason now picking up a loose ball on the left hand side and running forward goes down the left side of the penalty area scoops the ball in towards Harry Kane six yards out cleared away by Schlotterbeck the fair-haired central defender for Germany but it's over 560 minutes now England without a goal in open play they really have toiled of late in terms of creating opportunities they failed to score in four of their last five that goal against Germany in that 1-1 draw earlier on in the nation's late campaign was a penalty a sack of turns on the halfway line on the right back towards Rice as Rice runs forward and now towards Maguire he lays it off first time and we have under 19 minutes remaining with with you through until 10 o'clock tonight on five live sport we'll try and bring you as much reaction as we can down in the in the tunnel with John no doubt speaking to garris southgate and the number of the players has reached James forward ball Saka onto it right hand side back towards James James with a right footed cross comes out towards Shaw down into the ground it's cross the line surely goal is given and England have a goal back and it is Luke short to reduce the areas hope for England England one Germany two do you know what do you know what that stems from Jude Bellingham inside his own half being really brave on the ball is under pressure from three German attackers maneuvers the ball outright and then the ball is crossing England load the box for attackers in there goes all the way through to shore at the far post who takes a touch off his chest and chokes the ball down goes through test against legs and just over the line England showing a bit of character a bit of spirit back in this 21 always concerned when the game doesn't immediately restart but it now does they must have been having a look at that for the AR for for something but after a delay it is to want an England now it's a stoppage in play and Luke short one of the players who's been questioned about being in the starting 11 only two Premier League starts from Manchester United only three appearances all season for Eric Tenhard with his third goal for his country this is first was against Italy in the Euro final there's a Germany player down let's have a word with Andrews Townsend our guest hitting out on five live sport sets us up for an interesting finale now doesn't it yeah it does and England have obviously had to be more adventurous since Germany scored their goal we've had to come out more brought on more attacking players and like Chris said in commentary Jude Bellingham a bit of adventure he drove full with the ball and he made he made the opening happen for us to get our first goal but now it's going to be interesting we've got 20 odd minutes to really throw some bodies forward and see if we can break this German resolve and what about whilst there's still the treatment going on to I think it's Kimmich who's getting the treatment and the England players are getting a lot of liquid refreshment and having words with the coaching staff and Gareth Southgate when you when you're behind as an England player we were talking before off air weren't we about the level of scrutiny and the pressure that sometimes the players have got to play with you tune ill down you're in a bad run of form you character and resiliency is tested somewhat isn't it yeah of course but listen when you go two goals down whether an England player or not it's sort of what have I got to lose it's sort of right let's let's have a go yes we've been resolute we've been defensive we've played in the low block we've been disciplined but now we're two goals down let's go and play and I think we've seen that especially after the second goal maybe not after the first goal we've seen that attitude change attacking players have come on and England have definitely benefited because of it that's andross 10 10 thank you andross as Kimmich is able to come back onto the field of play with Germany leading by two goals to one rice wins the ball in the centre circle held up a little bit by Gnabry couldn't play it forward instead goes out towards the right hand side now sacca takes over sacca charging forward oh what a fine goal by mason mount hit it first time and what a fine fight back by england there is a super goal though by mason mount sacca did exceptionally well but now took it first time and took it so early he gave this shagging no chance and england from two little down and fought back at 2 2 wow that's magnificent from mount it really isn't there a south gate his substitutions what i say that's all sterling was a threat but that play from sacca direct and then the ball slipped into mount right hand side of the box 18 yards out he fizzes a right foot effort into the corner beats to second at his near post no blame attached to the goalkeeper too much pace and precision on the shot we've got a game on now either side of that injury to Kimmich england has scored two goals in a matter of minutes 71 and 74 so two goals in three minutes for england luke shore and mason mount and that has certainly transformed the mood here at wembley stadium and just talking about the character of the resilience with andros and then all of a sudden england with that with sacca to mason mount but what a fine goal from from mason mount the two substitutes combining his last goal march 2021 against albania he's yet to score for chelsea this season that will do his confidence the world of good because it was a super strike and england now will be thinking that they're going to go on to win it and we could have a very exciting last quarter of an hour here on bbc radio five live wonderful finish wasn't it the first time didn't think about it knew what he was or wanted to do and then to get that precision that much power that much bend on the effort absolutely brilliant and you felt garis i was gay needed that didn't he well it will still be if it was to stay like this a sixth game without winning but england are actually thinking they can go on and win it now as kane holds on to the ball passes the ball out towards james on that far side the right back to the england captain tries to play it early stopped by ghanabry but england now are very much on the front foot chris there they are two quick goals confidence up taking the game to germany just got to keep it going now keep that momentum up rice running forward to shore left corner of the area sure cross was blocked musiala picks it up now midway through his own half he's overrun that and belligan slides into the challenge belligan was happy with that challenge rice caught by his west ham teammate carer helped out by gunduan sliding across by mason mount there's a bite to england's play the crowd are responding steve holland also getting to try and whip the players up it's funny isn't it how there's a stoppage in play carer has gone down had england been too little and squandered a two-goal lead there would have been a sense of disappointment despite the fact that he may still finish two two but the fact that they fought back from two nil down will do wonders for the players confidence yeah it's it's massively positive isn't it and and also i think it's a it's a good message to the england supporters from the players to garrif sarsgate that raheem sterling spoke about you know we're all with garrif they enjoy garrif as england manager and going two nil down they could have chucked it they didn't you spoke about their resilience they're showing what they think of the england manager with this level of intensity essentially going into tonight's game nothing to play for relegated from the nation's league but the players are stuck at it just need harry mcguider to score the winner now thomas moeller has uh has come on musy aahler is the player who has has gone off and here is moeller straight away into the thick of the action the 33-year-old there was that period of time when he was out of the german national side after being dropped by yokem lerb the referee has played an advantage because mason mount was caught off the ball out towards james central area 30 yards out floats into the air here is that bellingham side onto goal plays it out towards the left this is sure left corner of the area back towards rice forward ball laid off by mount towards shore on the left hand side 2 2 on 5 live 11 minutes remaining sure coming forward enters the penalty area towards bellingham plays it out towards james and mark right hand side checks back crosses the ball with his right foot stretching to head it away with suhla the red shirt of illin get the ball back rice plays it forward much better from england germany now on the back foot rice chips the ball across towards race james right hand side back inside towards sack are able to turn the return ball bellingham on the stretch he was caught there he's arriving in agony his jude bellingham i tell you what that's such a strong challenge bellingham inside the box he gets caught anywhere else on the pitch that's a free kick i wonder look at this steve holland is furious he's just having a word with the fourth official england are going to put the ball out of play i think to allow treatment for bellingham no they're not james actually continues playing bellingham is now back on his feet rice spreads play out towards shore on the left hand side links up with harry k back heals the ball towards shore drifts into a central area two two on bbc radio five live and also bbc sounds a sack on that right touch line back towards bellingham under 10 minutes remain bellingham forward ball sack are able to turn edge of the area sack are into what harry k harry k with a turning shot hits the side netting england very very close to going three two up as now the referee will be having some sort of communication about that challenge a long time ago on bellingham as we will have a look at it yeah if you're just seeing the harry k neff it's sack are again dangerous off the right hand side here we are i think that's a penalty i think schlotterberg on bellingham catches bellingham on his right angle bellingham gets the ball first all the england players are surrounded by goalkeeper and the referee for the second time tonight has been instructed by paul van berkel the v ar to go across to his monitor and we know how this ends up this should result in an england penalty and harry kane with an opportunity to give england the chance to come from two nil down to maybe go three two up the potential penalty review and rossie think it's a penalty um i think we'll give it as it's gone to the monitor i don't think jude bellingham's in full control of the ball so i personally don't think it's a penalty the penalty is awarded and neco schlotterberg who conceded the penalty when these two sides met in munich has conceded a penalty and how the fortunes can be transformed on a fluctuating night in emotions for manager garrah southgate and his players it looked like a miserable run was going to continue a yellow card has been shown there to carat the west ham united defender by the duct referee and harry kane the captain 15 penalties he scored in his england career he did of course score from the spot against germany when it was one one in munich has a chance now to end this baron run for england and to completely turn this game on its head we have seven minutes remaining harry kane with a penalty against tischtegen two or three steps back harry kane waits runs up now and scores a sweet 16 from the spot for harry kane to cap a fine comeback for england to transform the fortunes for manager garrah southgate and the players and maybe they will set off to the world cup with a win after all from tunel down it's england three germany two harry kane right footed high into the top left hand corner lots of penalty this is harry kane whips the ball into the top corner goes across tischtegen who has absolutely no chance three goalkeepers wouldn't have saved that it's a brilliant penalty and england from behind from two down what a comeback that is it was a penalty i thought bellingham inside the box got there first with the touch schrotterberg it's a late challenge wasn't it just a point to the side of the head there to the temple from garrah southgate to the to the players now keep their their nerve their discipline for the next six minutes because three goals in the space of 13 minutes have completely transformed this game and garrah southgate's faith in the players vindicated with a scoreline here three two against germany who are looking at back-to-back defeats actually for the first time since october 2018 but what an emphatic penalty that was from harry kane just what the doctor ordered here for england's final match before katar mason mounts certainly has made a difference coming off the bench right hand side and getting a throw for for england how good has jude bellingham been in this second half i really think that he has been the difference for england his bravery in possession to drive past players make things happen but further forward england of course going behind but really pushed the germans back won the penalty can england hold on now see this through they received praise the other night from garrah southgate despite losing in in melanne jude bellingham 19 years of age this is when the starting 11 was named england 414 caps when they actually met in june against germany in munich 481 was the most experienced 11 named by garras southgate as the referee always gets in the way but again bellingham winning the ball there with a vital intervention in the midfield and harry kane now runs forward and suhla comes across as harry kane goes for gol from a tight angle on the left hand side of the penalty area but once again bellingham and the fact that calvin phillips is going to really have a struggle to get fit in time for the world cup you're looking at england's midfield partnership for katar in rice and bellingham oh what what i think 100 percent i mean bellingham has to be nailed on to start in katar i think he's shown enough and not just for katar either bellingham at 19 years of age decklin rise at 23 it'll be a partnership that should serve england well as canabry shoots from distance left by the goalkeeper he's lost it and on the follow-up an aeroban nick poke ty havertz smothers the ball in from close range and england may not get the win after all three minutes remain tot lost it havertz from close range has equalized at 3-3 but you can't believe this really it's i'm a big fan of nick poke not his kicking but his his actual handling but this is a is a howler the ball does bounce just in front of him down to his left hand side it's a standard catch for a goalkeeper really they do hundreds of these every week in training it's a shot from canabry and he just spills it and havertz alert has ever brought it in 3-3 here is short to mount 3-3 with two and a half minutes remaining bellingham left hand side of the penalty area belling china squeeze his way in between two german players havertz can't bring the ball away the mistakes have proved costly from england tonight okay and you've got a feel for carrot side skate haven't you you really have two nil down get themselves back into a brilliant position and then a basic error from nick poke in the england goal and it's all gone flat again hasn't it inside the stadium he would have thought it no salvation 3-3 germany are going to make a change 78,949 is the the attendance inside wembley here tonight here is havertz to moeller quite quiet since he came on thomas moeller persons with the cross headed away by harry maguire they're going to make a third and final change and it's going to be the south hampton defender bellicott chap who's going to come on for his germany debut the 21 year old who's south hampton side from bockham for just under nine million pounds already i notice he's been linked quite heavily with with liverpool despite only playing what six appearances for for the saints who did you hear that sources here is moeller edge of the area havertz looking to turn on a hat trick cleared away dug out well by maguire harry germany committed everybody forward saccaron the counterattack germany's white shirt splitting back saccaron to the penalty area right footed across the face of galt chance to win it inside the last 30 seconds there was a touch there from to shaggan to spoon the ball behind and it's gone out for a corner kick and it's so good from harry cayne it really is inside his own half whips the ball to sacca who's on his own on the right hand side gundewan last man on the center circle tries to get back but he can't match sackers pace and sack a right footed is creeping in tersteggan big fingers around the post that was a fingertips a havertz has come off bellicott chef has come on to replace kai havertz and england belligam struggling isn't it six minutes of of stoppage time which we're now into and jordan henderson is going to come on and it's belligam who is coming off jordan henderson who's missed the last three matches with a hamstring injury for for liverpool coming on for his 70th cap for belligam who's had a very impressive game in the in the midfield sure with the corner kick right down the throat of tersteggan three three christophe oh yeah we just just john murray they're just thinking harry maguire his big head getting on the end of a corner there for three england didn't happen poor corner meanwhile ganabri wins a throw for germany on this near side the right and maguire has now gone down but they won't be able to make the change because they've had the three opportunities to utilize their five substitutions so he's going to have to play on his is harry maguire for the next five minutes although they've only used four substitutions so far they've been at the three different intervals so maguire is just going to have to see it through for for england and the closing stages of what has been a second half that will have i'm sure even excited mark chappell i'm not so sure really he's got a high bar hasn't he here is muller england three germany three however what doesn't change the facts is that england will still be going to the world cup on the worst run of results in 29 years but oh come there will be and i get that but there has to be positivity yes in terms of the performance two down i think i said at the time it could have got really ugly but england really good resilience responded took the game to germany get themselves in front like they've shot themselves in the foot haven't they poor error from nick polk but i think a lot of positives for garras southgate and his team garras southgate yesterday was talking about the reaction externally will be result-based emotion-based but they eradicate the errors that have led to all three germany goals and elements of the performance certainly to maybe encourage the england manager but it will be six games without a win for the first time since and graham taylor was in charge back in 1993 the six match on that sequence of games was actually a defeat to germany in michigan when england were beaten by two goals to one however with two minutes remaining nick polk will be extremely disappointed with his own performance it was a shot that he spilled from ganabry and kai havert the beneficiary to get a late equalizer after england had produced an excellent fight back with three goals in 14 minutes and still fighting for the ball over on that far side and for germany each of their last three away matches have ended as a draw they've never previously drawn four on the road in succession but that's what they're looking at now under hansey flint three three here on five live tomorrow night ukraine scotland from crack group b1 scotland have a two-point advantage only have to avoid defeats against ukraine saturday our commentary is from anfield liverpool brighton at three west hand walls to follow that at 5 30 and then on sunday premier league five live sunday manchester city manchester united the adabi at two to be followed by leeds aston villa at 4 30 and next week the champions league resumes comprehensive coverage on five live as you'd expect as england forward at three three the flick by mount reaches saka henderson tries to win the ball on the edge of the area ball played away by carer to mullah goes to ground there's a german player down which means there's going to be a stoppage you play at zula three three chrisson yeah just an opportunity for england there but the germans scramble it clear and zula back on his feet there's a challenge with harry kane coming together harry kane caught him in the ribs he's back up here is carer forward ball on the right hand side maguire turns forward ball from him headed back by gunduan kimik the five minutes have added time the minimum of now being played so we enter the last 60 seconds now of stoppage time with the duck treporee here on five live with you through until 10 o'clock as much live reaction as we possibly can before 10 and then when collin murray takes over i'm sure if we get any live reaction into collin's program as james over on that right hand side finds saka is the one final time for for england saka tees up henderson henderson mason mount taking away off his toes inside the area back towards to steggen uh to steggen clears the ball away that probably will be it now the six minutes have almost elapsed kimik waits what has certainly been an entertaining second half yeah i mean it's been blow for blow hasn't it and then really responding well there you go three three and there is the full-time whistle so england's run continues without a victory extended to six games worst run of results in 29 years however as the two managers embrace and share a smile hansy flick and garras southgate there will certainly be elements of that performance to encourage the england manager garras southgate and certainly one man in particular who gets a pat on the back will be jude belligham as he makes his way out onto the pitch after coming off and garras southgate it could have been so much worse when his side were two nil down and it could have been so much better had it not been for an error from nick pope when they were then three two up but as it was it finished england three germany three mark
