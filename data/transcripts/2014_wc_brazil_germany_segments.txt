[0.00 - 1.60] P:2065.40 E:0.014437 |  He's watching this game.
[1.60 - 6.88] P:2022.26 E:0.075718 |  Certainly Thiago Silva was out there helping to plurt the players to warm up before we started.
[6.88 - 13.60] P:2065.06 E:0.090382 |  And now he get underway and Schweinsteiger immediately takes up that deep position in front of the back four.
[13.60 - 15.24] P:1970.01 E:0.101705 |  The Germans give the ball away.
[15.24 - 17.28] P:2011.53 E:0.085421 |  Luis Gustavo intercepted.
[17.28 - 19.44] P:1984.52 E:0.087666 |  Closer tries to go round Marcello.
[19.44 - 22.72] P:1901.94 E:0.083119 |  And now Marcello building over on the left-hand side.
[22.72 - 23.76] P:1931.78 E:0.082320 |  Five live.
[23.76 - 25.36] P:2008.15 E:0.078024 |  Breathtaking fixture.
[25.36 - 26.64] P:2020.57 E:0.097355 |  Germany, Brazil.
[26.64 - 28.96] P:2004.07 E:0.089737 |  The ball played forward. Schweinsteiger cuts it out.
[28.96 - 30.80] P:2000.53 E:0.072756 |  It almost dropped to Oscar.
[30.80 - 33.52] P:1963.67 E:0.083273 |  The Brazilians trying to set an early tempo here.
[33.52 - 36.72] P:1897.32 E:0.085603 |  And Bernhard is playing up on this right-hand side at the moment.
[36.72 - 38.72] P:1915.73 E:0.093061 |  The ball is played forward to Fernandinho.
[38.72 - 40.88] P:1836.75 E:0.085791 |  Fernandinho is going to try and win a corner kick.
[40.88 - 43.20] P:1938.14 E:0.080130 |  I think he might have made it down there.
[43.20 - 46.32] P:1966.82 E:0.084875 |  Brazil attacking right from the start.
[46.32 - 48.56] P:1963.78 E:0.082035 |  With Maicon doing good work.
[48.56 - 52.08] P:1964.49 E:0.085325 |  And they have this corner inside the first minute of the game.
[52.08 - 55.44] P:1913.58 E:0.074495 |  The first test for Neuer and his defenders.
[55.44 - 58.64] P:1874.46 E:0.090417 |  Fernandinho makes his way into the six-yard area.
[58.72 - 60.64] P:1838.30 E:0.083580 |  David Luiz is there.
[60.64 - 65.36] P:1889.77 E:0.085457 |  Who's been quite a specialist in the knockout stage of the World Cup with goals.
[65.36 - 67.36] P:1862.12 E:0.092255 |  The corner kick to be taken by Oscar.
[67.36 - 72.64] P:1783.90 E:0.083116 |  But before it does, there's something happening on the goal line between Neuer and Fernandinho.
[72.64 - 75.20] P:1807.62 E:0.072016 |  Which the Mexican referee sorts out.
[75.20 - 76.88] P:1817.16 E:0.074610 |  And now we're ready.
[76.88 - 78.16] P:1848.06 E:0.079272 |  Oscar prepares.
[78.16 - 79.68] P:1868.03 E:0.096315 |  Bernhard offers his services.
[79.68 - 81.76] P:1950.64 E:0.095871 |  And it goes, headed away by the Germans.
[81.76 - 84.48] P:1915.91 E:0.074078 |  Well defended there by the centre-backs.
[84.48 - 86.64] P:1917.78 E:0.079931 |  Marcello picks up the loose ball.
[86.64 - 89.84] P:1898.14 E:0.084635 |  And Hulck, who seems to be playing over on the left-hand side at the moment,
[89.84 - 92.56] P:1899.47 E:0.094393 |  finds Dante, who's stayed forward following the corner.
[92.56 - 94.40] P:1928.02 E:0.082879 |  And it goes, headed away by Hoveders.
[94.40 - 96.80] P:1900.38 E:0.081318 |  The Germans haven't crossed the half-way line yet.
[96.80 - 99.76] P:1947.67 E:0.101573 |  Now they might as Chris Ohersels tumbled over.
[99.76 - 102.80] P:1933.49 E:0.091810 |  And Brazil have the ball again down this right-hand side of the field.
[102.80 - 104.96] P:1953.11 E:0.083618 |  David Luiz is pointing to Oscar.
[104.96 - 106.88] P:1829.32 E:0.076834 |  Fred is waiting in the penalty area.
[106.88 - 110.00] P:1938.36 E:0.093344 |  Oscar turns the ball back a little short to Luis Castarvo.
[110.00 - 112.40] P:1956.13 E:0.093599 |  But Castarvo goes snapping into the challenge.
[112.40 - 114.64] P:1927.41 E:0.086513 |  And this is a really good start from Brazil.
[114.64 - 117.28] P:1930.18 E:0.080605 |  Castarvo again with Fred Poist in the area.
[117.28 - 119.68] P:1855.65 E:0.075914 |  By the corner flag, inviting the challenge.
[119.68 - 121.52] P:1828.85 E:0.081422 |  Looking for the corner, it's a throw.
[121.52 - 122.24] P:1856.78 E:0.081162 |  Dante?
[122.24 - 125.04] P:1940.08 E:0.091593 |  This is exactly how the Brazil start against Colombia.
[125.04 - 127.60] P:1939.44 E:0.080244 |  On the front foot, Hulck is on that left-hand side.
[127.60 - 130.00] P:1759.31 E:0.085027 |  A lot of people expect him Bernhard to play over there.
[130.00 - 133.28] P:1813.53 E:0.086837 |  But he played very, very well, especially the first half against Colombia.
[133.28 - 135.44] P:1758.75 E:0.083380 |  Got the ball and ran up people, caused problems.
[135.44 - 137.36] P:2016.42 E:0.105825 |  Castarvo on the edge of the German area.
[137.36 - 138.40] P:1984.83 E:0.096224 |  He falls over as well.
[138.40 - 140.40] P:1889.79 E:0.094057 |  But Marcello intercepts ahead of Muller.
[140.40 - 142.40] P:1836.55 E:0.081654 |  Marcello shot his one.
[142.48 - 146.32] P:1915.06 E:0.090016 |  And the Brazilians are rather optimistically appealing for a corner kick.
[146.32 - 147.92] P:1966.21 E:0.078970 |  It's not there for them.
[147.92 - 150.16] P:1956.54 E:0.090700 |  A little bit of late evening sunshine breaks through.
[150.16 - 152.80] P:1863.83 E:0.087759 |  It's certainly been overcast over the last couple of hours.
[152.80 - 156.40] P:1811.25 E:0.078752 |  But it's absolutely perfect conditions for this semi-final.
[156.40 - 158.16] P:1729.32 E:0.100780 |  Well, Brazil very much on the front foot.
[158.16 - 161.60] P:1779.50 E:0.086096 |  I think Luis Castarvo was tricked by Schweinsteiger.
[161.60 - 163.84] P:1824.81 E:0.090499 |  Referee again, been a little bit lenient.
[163.84 - 166.72] P:1821.34 E:0.086211 |  But we've seen a lot of that during this World Cup so far.
[166.72 - 169.20] P:1719.81 E:0.085236 |  But Brazil very much on the front foot.
[169.20 - 171.52] P:1768.65 E:0.085124 |  I think they want to get at this German side early on.
[171.60 - 173.84] P:1835.57 E:0.090278 |  Botein's rather aimless ball out of defence.
[173.84 - 175.76] P:1847.00 E:0.090831 |  That really isn't very German like at all.
[175.76 - 178.88] P:1904.79 E:0.083564 |  They do keep possession most of the time.
[178.88 - 181.12] P:1835.99 E:0.091453 |  The morning newspaper in Belorosante.
[181.12 - 184.00] P:1830.34 E:0.082882 |  The big headline this morning was BH Belorosante.
[184.00 - 185.52] P:1809.64 E:0.078346 |  Capital de Mundo.
[185.52 - 186.96] P:1783.32 E:0.084622 |  That's how they see it here.
[186.96 - 189.52] P:1824.19 E:0.091749 |  Long ball forward down the left-hand side, looking for Hulk.
[189.52 - 190.48] P:1856.91 E:0.100232 |  Lambs let it run on.
[190.48 - 191.44] P:1949.65 E:0.087471 |  And Hulk has got there.
[191.44 - 192.64] P:1872.84 E:0.100271 |  And Hulk pulls the ball back.
[192.64 - 194.96] P:1917.96 E:0.090173 |  And Neuer makes the diving save.
[194.96 - 199.04] P:1915.11 E:0.082593 |  And I'm surprised that Lam wasn't tighter there on Hulk over on the far side.
[199.04 - 201.12] P:1870.62 E:0.089747 |  Well, at the moment, the Germans are rattled.
[201.12 - 202.16] P:1780.76 E:0.097865 |  They're giving the ball away here.
[202.16 - 203.84] P:1827.84 E:0.080865 |  A couple of long balls so far.
[203.84 - 205.12] P:2021.48 E:0.089642 |  Now they've got a chance to go forward.
[205.12 - 206.40] P:1960.44 E:0.091387 |  Kedira picks up closer.
[206.40 - 207.68] P:1982.51 E:0.093619 |  In steps, David Louise.
[207.68 - 208.96] P:1959.18 E:0.098199 |  Closer rides the challenge.
[208.96 - 212.88] P:1964.63 E:0.081828 |  But then he's helped out by the player
[212.88 - 214.88] P:1990.79 E:0.101909 |  who's come in for Thiago Silverdante,
[214.88 - 217.44] P:1960.62 E:0.081699 |  playing in the World Cup for the first time this evening.
[217.44 - 219.60] P:1940.16 E:0.078727 |  The man who made his Brazilian debut
[219.60 - 225.36] P:1959.86 E:0.086977 |  when Scolari returned to Brazil at Wembley against England in February 2013.
[225.36 - 227.60] P:2055.04 E:0.099200 |  On five live, the Germans can just see now,
[227.60 - 229.44] P:2048.34 E:0.099762 |  they're just trying to calm things down here
[229.44 - 230.64] P:2088.18 E:0.096485 |  and get a little feel of the ball
[230.64 - 233.76] P:2055.61 E:0.093763 |  because they haven't had any possession at all early on here.
[233.76 - 235.20] P:2014.31 E:0.082344 |  Just listen to the crowd, though, Mike.
[235.20 - 238.24] P:1986.64 E:0.077143 |  Every time the Germans get it, there's Buen, there's Jiren.
[238.24 - 240.72] P:2021.14 E:0.095753 |  Every Brazilian pass is a cheer and a lay.
[241.36 - 242.72] P:2030.84 E:0.097278 |  This is going to be some atmosphere.
[242.72 - 244.08] P:2038.98 E:0.090325 |  And I think this is going to be some game.
[244.72 - 246.00] P:2053.61 E:0.096478 |  Throw into Germany.
[246.64 - 248.24] P:1934.36 E:0.090807 |  All out of play from Michael.
[249.44 - 252.72] P:1941.37 E:0.080003 |  Holding off Danny Alves now in that right back position.
[252.72 - 253.76] P:1971.56 E:0.096019 |  Throw into the Germans.
[253.76 - 254.80] P:2003.00 E:0.091187 |  Robertus takes it.
[254.80 - 256.48] P:2020.11 E:0.094405 |  Nobody's picked up Tony Kruse.
[256.48 - 258.64] P:1981.70 E:0.099235 |  Kruse lifts it down the right-hand side to Lam.
[258.72 - 261.12] P:2022.80 E:0.090973 |  First time we've seen the Germans really coming forward.
[261.12 - 263.28] P:2031.20 E:0.091754 |  Lam tucks the ball back into midfield and Kedira.
[263.28 - 264.88] P:2021.79 E:0.086560 |  This is better now from Germany.
[264.88 - 266.72] P:2029.43 E:0.100484 |  Schweinsteiger, though, doesn't go forward.
[267.28 - 269.44] P:2081.58 E:0.093071 |  Keeps possession, plays it back to Boateng.
[269.44 - 272.72] P:2069.64 E:0.092023 |  Little flick from Kedira, Muller's there over on the right-hand side.
[272.72 - 276.16] P:1962.75 E:0.092473 |  And the crowd are cheering because Germany have the ball, not for long now.
[276.16 - 280.08] P:1921.26 E:0.077600 |  Oscar down the left-hand side and the ball is nicked away from him
[280.08 - 282.16] P:1864.91 E:0.068702 |  by Philippe Lam, the German captain.
[282.16 - 284.40] P:1797.66 E:0.072380 |  And Brazil have a throw in on the halfway.
[285.04 - 286.88] P:1883.86 E:0.090388 |  Sensational atmosphere here.
[286.96 - 289.52] P:1870.52 E:0.080546 |  And Bella Horizonte for the first of these two semifinals.
[290.08 - 291.52] P:1960.84 E:0.103861 |  Germany nil, Brazil nil.
[292.08 - 298.80] P:1858.54 E:0.083958 |  And we've played just under five minutes of a breathless first half-star.
[298.80 - 302.24] P:1831.34 E:0.094306 |  Ball back with Julio Cesar in the Brazilian goal.
[302.80 - 305.60] P:1764.63 E:0.096209 |  Brazil now building with Luis Gustavo.
[305.60 - 307.76] P:1840.35 E:0.092143 |  Who knows all about these German players, of course.
[307.76 - 311.84] P:1787.42 E:0.082207 |  He plays now with Wolfsburg, but had great success with Bayern Munich.
[311.84 - 313.92] P:1820.41 E:0.092100 |  Here's the Bayern Munich centre-back Dante.
[314.48 - 318.56] P:1840.71 E:0.086588 |  Back again to Luis Gustavo. Scolari's pointing down there.
[318.56 - 320.32] P:1897.96 E:0.090813 |  Brazil trying to stay patient here.
[320.96 - 322.64] P:1841.74 E:0.082054 |  And the ball is back again with Gustavo.
[322.64 - 324.72] P:1894.96 E:0.081439 |  He's almost playing as one of three centre-backs at the moment.
[325.28 - 328.24] P:1877.58 E:0.084801 |  Brazil just keeping it, just biding their time.
[328.24 - 331.84] P:1936.24 E:0.095533 |  Then it's nudged into the centre-circle and given away by Fernandinho.
[331.84 - 334.24] P:2009.60 E:0.093686 |  Poor first touch, though, by Mesut Erzl.
[334.24 - 336.96] P:1937.88 E:0.081529 |  And it comes crashing forward from the left-back Hoveders.
[336.96 - 339.92] P:1943.04 E:0.083752 |  And Julio says, ah, well, he might have left that, but he's kept it in
[339.92 - 341.12] P:1992.96 E:0.076160 |  so he can clear for Brazil.
[341.60 - 345.52] P:1812.22 E:0.084059 |  Again, Brazil are snapping into the tackles like they did against Colombia.
[345.52 - 348.96] P:1723.48 E:0.084349 |  But also, when Germany get it, they're playing a very, very high tempo,
[348.96 - 353.12] P:1761.07 E:0.081214 |  closing people down. A very bright start from the Brazilian team.
[353.12 - 354.32] P:1855.28 E:0.086471 |  Why do you think that they've...
[354.32 - 357.28] P:1845.30 E:0.083969 |  Well, you all expected Bernardo to play left and Holt right, didn't we?
[357.28 - 358.80] P:1757.73 E:0.082668 |  Any reason why they're not doing that?
[358.80 - 362.24] P:1877.13 E:0.080819 |  I think Holt played really well, especially in the last game.
[362.24 - 364.32] P:1929.09 E:0.075813 |  He got the ball and he ran at people.
[364.32 - 366.80] P:1942.46 E:0.091127 |  Philip Larmes, not the quickest, not getting any younger.
[367.44 - 370.00] P:1923.54 E:0.055537 |  The ball is out of play and the Germans...
[370.00 - 372.88] P:1879.08 E:0.089535 |  It's just very unusual, Danny, I did the game against France
[372.88 - 376.40] P:1823.26 E:0.082350 |  in the quarter-final when the Germans just had a stranglehold
[376.40 - 378.32] P:1739.50 E:0.076439 |  right from the start, but they rattled here.
[378.32 - 383.76] P:1729.28 E:0.080311 |  I think this anthem, the atmosphere, gives the Brazilian players such a lift
[383.76 - 385.76] P:1779.88 E:0.085613 |  in the first 10, 15 minutes.
[385.76 - 388.64] P:1742.32 E:0.080283 |  You can almost see the adrenaline pumping out of them.
[388.64 - 393.76] P:1805.25 E:0.077489 |  You know, faces, veins, you know, the intensity on their faces.
[394.72 - 399.20] P:1853.80 E:0.081845 |  They've got to control that, but that certainly gives them an edge
[399.20 - 402.64] P:1880.38 E:0.071093 |  in the first 10, 15 minutes in terms of energy, closing people down.
[402.64 - 407.92] P:1890.26 E:0.086987 |  Well, it was 64 years ago to this day that Brazil beat Spain 6-1
[407.92 - 410.96] P:1903.24 E:0.076119 |  to effectively qualify for the 1950 World Cup final,
[410.96 - 413.20] P:1883.89 E:0.080645 |  which they lost, of course, to Uruguay.
[413.20 - 416.32] P:1833.94 E:0.089579 |  And they've won their last six World Cup semi-finals
[416.32 - 419.84] P:1954.64 E:0.093914 |  and here now go Germany dangerously down the right-hand side.
[419.84 - 423.36] P:1981.92 E:0.097188 |  Muller is poised on the edge of the area and it goes, travels a very long way.
[423.44 - 426.72] P:1987.26 E:0.089198 |  Erzl's there. Erzl tacks it in. Kedira had a shot, which was blocked.
[426.72 - 430.32] P:1922.49 E:0.080790 |  Germany's best move. Muller again over on the right-hand side.
[430.32 - 433.12] P:1962.79 E:0.084019 |  Suddenly Germany pounced and almost cut through.
[433.12 - 436.00] P:2007.26 E:0.090371 |  Muller down the right-hand side, taking on Dante.
[436.00 - 438.48] P:2033.39 E:0.092130 |  Still Muller, trying to dink the ball into the area.
[438.48 - 440.80] P:2030.82 E:0.085127 |  Boateng is now supporting this latest attack.
[440.80 - 443.92] P:2017.30 E:0.089867 |  That's a rather aimless ball into the area and the free kick is given
[444.80 - 448.00] P:1989.18 E:0.087931 |  against Germany, against Closer for the foul on David Louise.
[448.00 - 452.08] P:1951.22 E:0.076176 |  But Germany then just causing Brazil for the first time a few problems.
[452.08 - 456.96] P:1892.78 E:0.080817 |  Well, if Germany can manage to soak up the pressure, which they will do at times,
[456.96 - 461.68] P:1836.61 E:0.083491 |  they will then hit the Macauge. Actually, the ball hit Tony Cruz on the back side.
[461.68 - 465.76] P:1800.79 E:0.078253 |  There's a ball cut across the area from Erzl.
[465.76 - 468.00] P:1814.47 E:0.086176 |  But that's what the Germans will do. They will sit back.
[468.00 - 470.80] P:1875.87 E:0.084599 |  They will soak up this pressure. They will take it.
[470.80 - 473.28] P:1770.94 E:0.082658 |  They will remain cool. They will remain collected.
[473.28 - 476.88] P:1823.82 E:0.086992 |  But when they get the ball, they have the quality to go and hurt you as well.
[476.88 - 480.48] P:1965.22 E:0.096337 |  The Brazilians building slowly from the back and Hoverdez almost used his arm
[480.48 - 483.60] P:1921.37 E:0.080974 |  to control that. But he has the ball, the left back from Schalke.
[483.60 - 486.08] P:1973.47 E:0.101614 |  Looks for Erzl, who's struggling to make an impact here.
[486.08 - 490.40] P:1965.42 E:0.097610 |  Maikon takes the ball away from Erzl. Maikon's ball in towards Frett on the edge of the area.
[490.40 - 492.72] P:1947.60 E:0.089458 |  Frett brings it down, almost got that through to Oskar.
[492.72 - 495.60] P:1947.09 E:0.080508 |  Brilliant defending though by Schweinsteiger to Germany.
[495.60 - 496.96] P:1896.58 E:0.085640 |  And a good ball out of defense.
[496.96 - 500.80] P:1958.57 E:0.090311 |  But immediately, Brazil trying to smother Germany in central midfield.
[500.80 - 503.52] P:1997.72 E:0.094571 |  But Germany still get going. It's crossed down the left-hand side.
[503.52 - 505.52] P:1978.13 E:0.091540 |  Muller is calling for it over on the far side.
[505.52 - 510.16] P:1991.06 E:0.083283 |  The ball is cut back to Kedira. 25 yards out. Kedira on now to Muller.
[510.24 - 511.84] P:1967.30 E:0.096217 |  Muller down the German right-hand side.
[511.84 - 514.48] P:1950.14 E:0.095665 |  But Marcelo makes a very important interception.
[514.48 - 517.76] P:1909.53 E:0.088823 |  And then he's caught by Muller. And the free kick will have to be given.
[517.76 - 520.88] P:1987.87 E:0.090417 |  But Muller's a specialist at finding space.
[520.88 - 524.00] P:1998.20 E:0.086211 |  And Marcelo's going to have to be really on his game tonight.
[524.00 - 525.84] P:1995.21 E:0.087499 |  Such a contrast in styles, isn't it?
[525.84 - 528.88] P:1953.05 E:0.081754 |  Even then, David-Louise came forward, lost attack on him.
[528.88 - 531.28] P:1908.90 E:0.090054 |  The Brazil defense was all over the shop.
[531.28 - 533.60] P:1918.23 E:0.082807 |  But they streamed back in numbers.
[533.60 - 536.64] P:1856.73 E:0.079483 |  You know, it's all about effort and passion for Brazil.
[536.64 - 538.80] P:1839.65 E:0.084572 |  Germany, it's about control.
[538.88 - 541.60] P:1870.04 E:0.082442 |  You know, staying cool, keeping possession of the ball.
[541.60 - 543.68] P:1868.38 E:0.097282 |  Both teams have been guilty of giving the ball away at the moment.
[543.68 - 545.92] P:1829.43 E:0.076406 |  But I think that's understandable. A lot of nerves about.
[546.64 - 550.00] P:1842.94 E:0.088519 |  And I'm struck by how slowly Brazil are building from inside their own half.
[550.00 - 552.08] P:1872.20 E:0.084478 |  And then they're looking to try and hit diagonal balls.
[552.08 - 554.72] P:1926.21 E:0.071569 |  And just looking for some precision to trouble.
[554.72 - 557.76] P:1942.76 E:0.093239 |  And there's a bit of an exchange down there between Closer and Louise.
[558.48 - 560.80] P:1933.78 E:0.076639 |  And that's going to be a free kick to Brazil.
[560.80 - 565.44] P:1936.44 E:0.081514 |  David-Louise is now really taken over from Neymar as the poster boy here.
[565.44 - 568.56] P:1914.85 E:0.076679 |  His face was all over the front pages of the papers this morning.
[568.64 - 569.84] P:1965.18 E:0.082481 |  And he takes a free kick.
[569.84 - 572.64] P:1910.27 E:0.095957 |  And that's an interesting one towards Hulk over on the far side.
[572.64 - 574.88] P:1949.74 E:0.084070 |  Hulk reaches for it, doesn't control it.
[574.88 - 576.48] P:1923.04 E:0.078154 |  Across comes Philippe Lange.
[576.48 - 579.52] P:1860.79 E:0.078500 |  Hulk trying to turn away from the German captain.
[579.52 - 581.44] P:1887.45 E:0.098065 |  Hulk still supported by Marcelo.
[581.44 - 582.96] P:1913.64 E:0.092554 |  And that move has broken down.
[582.96 - 584.24] P:1973.39 E:0.089461 |  And the Germans are breaking.
[584.24 - 585.76] P:1969.28 E:0.089147 |  And Kedira's on the ball.
[585.76 - 587.68] P:1910.64 E:0.082538 |  And the Brazilians haven't cut it out.
[587.68 - 589.52] P:2002.43 E:0.096738 |  And now Thomas Müller for Germany.
[589.52 - 591.04] P:2026.20 E:0.089261 |  Really good counterattack here.
[591.04 - 594.56] P:2006.56 E:0.090448 |  Kedira has a chance to pull it in towards Closer.
[594.56 - 596.24] P:1944.65 E:0.094440 |  Instead has to settle for a corner kick.
[596.24 - 598.00] P:2055.07 E:0.096211 |  This is Germany's first corner.
[598.56 - 602.32] P:1873.74 E:0.078345 |  But remember, with people like Hummels down there, they can be very dangerous.
[602.96 - 603.92] P:1767.28 E:0.085403 |  I don't want to put the moccasins on it,
[603.92 - 606.88] P:1949.35 E:0.087552 |  but it looks like it's shaped up to be a really entertaining game, isn't it?
[606.88 - 609.84] P:1990.05 E:0.095997 |  Brazil clearly trying to isolate the full backs.
[609.84 - 613.04] P:1942.96 E:0.091724 |  Hit diagonals over the top for Bernard and Holtzra on two.
[613.04 - 616.32] P:2002.24 E:0.090465 |  Germany quite happy to soak up the pressure from the counterattack.
[616.32 - 617.44] P:2053.88 E:0.099729 |  Corner kick to Germany.
[618.08 - 621.20] P:2051.05 E:0.100490 |  All eyes maybe on Hummels who score that goal against France.
[622.00 - 623.68] P:2046.84 E:0.100959 |  In goes the corner kick.
[623.68 - 625.28] P:1889.84 E:0.105772 |  Troubles a very long way and it's gone in.
[626.24 - 629.04] P:1830.58 E:0.109586 |  And that man has done it again, Thomas Müller.
[629.76 - 631.68] P:1770.50 E:0.106630 |  Nobody picked him up at the far post.
[632.24 - 634.64] P:1845.71 E:0.093669 |  Müller wrapped his right leg around it.
[634.64 - 638.72] P:1828.68 E:0.097107 |  And this specialist in tournament football, Thomas Müller,
[638.72 - 643.12] P:1813.38 E:0.095873 |  maybe the key man in this German side, has stunned Belahorizonte.
[643.12 - 645.36] P:1874.66 E:0.096043 |  He's given the Germans the lead after 10 minutes.
[645.36 - 647.20] P:1846.88 E:0.099592 |  Brazil nail Germany 1.
[648.00 - 649.60] P:1857.63 E:0.091162 |  Disaster almost for Brazil.
[650.16 - 651.52] P:1788.41 E:0.097248 |  We're on the front foot on top.
[651.52 - 652.40] P:1840.41 E:0.091955 |  The ball comes in.
[653.20 - 656.56] P:1833.64 E:0.088512 |  Nobody at all is marking Müller.
[656.56 - 658.00] P:1947.95 E:0.085519 |  I think it's David Luiz.
[658.00 - 659.44] P:1860.99 E:0.081452 |  He's lost his man.
[659.44 - 661.92] P:1915.73 E:0.091086 |  He's got a little bit wrapped up in his first 10 minutes.
[661.92 - 663.12] P:1923.13 E:0.087800 |  He's had a couple of challenges.
[663.92 - 665.04] P:1756.47 E:0.084853 |  Hasn't picked his man up.
[665.04 - 668.00] P:1873.29 E:0.088779 |  Müller just a little bit of movement, just pulled off the shoulder.
[668.72 - 671.04] P:1817.06 E:0.081173 |  And well, a very, very simple finish.
[671.04 - 672.24] P:1888.21 E:0.079451 |  Five goals hit for now.
[672.24 - 673.84] P:1903.83 E:0.077714 |  But that's David Luiz.
[673.84 - 676.16] P:1913.74 E:0.085976 |  Wrapped up, you know, he was chasing down a minute ago.
[676.16 - 678.96] P:1850.93 E:0.074142 |  He had a clash with Closer.
[679.92 - 681.12] P:1829.61 E:0.074514 |  That's what we talked about.
[681.20 - 682.64] P:1816.47 E:0.081614 |  He has to remain disciplined.
[682.64 - 685.84] P:1817.34 E:0.086999 |  The emotion and adrenaline has gone a little bit too much for him.
[685.84 - 687.12] P:1898.60 E:0.068326 |  He's just lost concentration.
[688.00 - 690.00] P:1909.33 E:0.097045 |  Well, I think it was said during the build-up to this game
[690.00 - 692.72] P:1826.31 E:0.088483 |  that Thiago Silva helps to protect David Luiz.
[692.72 - 697.04] P:1841.55 E:0.092072 |  He's no partner tonight, but now can Brazil respond down that left-hand side with Hulk?
[697.92 - 699.28] P:1907.14 E:0.095032 |  Hulk challenged by Bote.
[700.48 - 702.32] P:1832.60 E:0.074607 |  And that's going to be a goal kick for Germany.
[702.32 - 703.84] P:1889.35 E:0.097164 |  Well, if you've been with us from the start,
[703.84 - 707.92] P:1914.26 E:0.084293 |  you'd have gathered that it was an alien atmosphere here for the German side.
[707.92 - 708.96] P:1901.86 E:0.085465 |  But now they've scored that goal.
[708.96 - 710.72] P:1844.11 E:0.071946 |  They're really going to settle into the semi-finals.
[711.36 - 712.80] P:1802.03 E:0.092079 |  They'll take all the pressure off the Germans.
[712.80 - 716.08] P:1786.75 E:0.082583 |  But I think now Brazil have to keep doing what they're doing and start attacking
[716.64 - 718.24] P:1770.98 E:0.085993 |  and at every opportunity.
[718.24 - 721.84] P:1855.88 E:0.089890 |  You know, this crowd will get behind them all the way through the game.
[721.84 - 725.92] P:1921.12 E:0.085449 |  But like we said, contrast in styles, Germany, cool as you like.
[725.92 - 728.40] P:1868.22 E:0.073746 |  One chance, bang, back of the net goal.
[728.40 - 730.64] P:1921.30 E:0.093300 |  He's a phenomenal talent, Thomas Muller,
[730.64 - 733.12] P:1929.49 E:0.086117 |  the man, of course, who really undid England at the last World Cup.
[733.12 - 735.92] P:1935.21 E:0.084263 |  He's now scored five goals at this World Cup.
[735.92 - 739.36] P:1897.69 E:0.082017 |  He's won behind Rodriguez, the Colombian,
[739.36 - 741.84] P:1906.83 E:0.072245 |  and well, Brazil have been caught.
[741.84 - 745.12] P:1912.83 E:0.092708 |  And it was a goal to really distress Luis Filipe Scolari,
[745.12 - 747.28] P:1912.55 E:0.082428 |  because it was so basic, so straightforward,
[747.28 - 748.96] P:1862.24 E:0.080053 |  from the corner kick, from the set piece,
[749.84 - 751.44] P:1834.42 E:0.085926 |  and it really shouldn't have happened.
[751.44 - 752.56] P:1999.61 E:0.100711 |  Julio says, are clears.
[753.12 - 758.24] P:1859.73 E:0.081643 |  So all that early exuberance here has been, in a sense,
[758.24 - 759.76] P:1909.18 E:0.089706 |  quashed by that German goal.
[759.76 - 762.16] P:1836.57 E:0.074494 |  Can the Brazilians now come back again?
[762.16 - 765.28] P:1876.86 E:0.081959 |  They haven't found themselves in this position at the tournament,
[766.08 - 768.08] P:1916.32 E:0.092553 |  as that's a nameless ball from Louise,
[768.16 - 770.32] P:1940.12 E:0.083017 |  and that's straight through to Neuer once more.
[770.32 - 773.12] P:1900.68 E:0.082259 |  And I'm not surprised to see Scolari down there
[773.12 - 775.36] P:1920.04 E:0.074806 |  trying to just sort a few things out.
[775.36 - 776.56] P:1825.43 E:0.090157 |  Well, they clearly had a game plan,
[776.56 - 778.96] P:1776.07 E:0.075214 |  which was to use diagonal balls, get him behind the full backs.
[779.60 - 780.40] P:1727.74 E:0.094910 |  But David Louise...
[781.68 - 783.68] P:1930.12 E:0.099218 |  Ball headed on by closer to Muller.
[783.68 - 786.48] P:1986.32 E:0.088951 |  He doesn't take it cleanly, though, and Louise steps in.
[786.48 - 788.24] P:1940.42 E:0.085130 |  I'll bring back Danny again in a moment,
[788.24 - 791.60] P:1991.87 E:0.092081 |  as Louise now strides forward to try and redeem the error.
[791.60 - 794.16] P:1976.32 E:0.092834 |  Ball down the left-hand side to play in Hulke.
[794.16 - 795.68] P:1985.66 E:0.095953 |  Fred is steaming in the area.
[795.68 - 796.56] P:2012.36 E:0.089793 |  Hulke is there.
[796.56 - 799.44] P:1969.21 E:0.083591 |  The drag back, though, has only gone to a German player,
[799.44 - 803.60] P:1942.70 E:0.082503 |  and Lawn will clear and find the man who's always in space, Muller,
[803.60 - 804.72] P:1858.42 E:0.080327 |  over on the right-hand side.
[804.72 - 806.96] P:1955.96 E:0.083082 |  The goal scorer here. Muller thinks he was fouled,
[806.96 - 808.00] P:1860.99 E:0.063084 |  and the referee agrees.
[808.72 - 810.48] P:1943.43 E:0.073526 |  But again, concentration.
[810.48 - 813.52] P:1909.50 E:0.074234 |  You know, David Louise, we've seen how energetic he gets.
[813.52 - 815.52] P:1933.37 E:0.072428 |  We've seen the passion in his face.
[815.52 - 817.52] P:1848.58 E:0.079927 |  Even at the moment, he's trying to be everywhere,
[817.52 - 818.32] P:1737.60 E:0.082776 |  running on over the shop.
[818.32 - 820.32] P:1802.87 E:0.076903 |  I've already said that, you know, when they break,
[820.88 - 823.36] P:1885.14 E:0.076538 |  the Brazilian defence looks disorganised.
[823.36 - 825.20] P:1845.88 E:0.079744 |  You know, they all run back in numbers.
[825.28 - 826.72] P:1732.63 E:0.090184 |  There's no real authority there.
[827.44 - 830.00] P:1921.59 E:0.078146 |  And you know, David Louise, the emotion just got him.
[830.00 - 831.68] P:1885.02 E:0.073110 |  Lost concentration for a split second.
[831.68 - 834.56] P:1850.40 E:0.072584 |  Thomas Muller, 10 goals now in World Cup football.
[834.56 - 836.32] P:1881.49 E:0.071464 |  He's still got two World Cups left as well.
[836.32 - 840.32] P:1806.09 E:0.068102 |  He's probably going to break that record of 15 goals, isn't he?
[841.52 - 842.80] P:2000.05 E:0.105811 |  Well, I'm sure you're right, Danny.
[842.80 - 844.72] P:1883.46 E:0.079084 |  Of course, closest hoping to do that tonight.
[844.72 - 846.64] P:1889.47 E:0.073507 |  He's on 15 with Ronaldo.
[846.64 - 849.60] P:1862.74 E:0.089446 |  If there was any self-doubt about these Brazilians
[849.60 - 851.76] P:1892.85 E:0.080341 |  losing Neymar and Tiago Silva,
[851.76 - 854.88] P:1919.69 E:0.083383 |  well, surely that's increased here now, following that goal.
[854.88 - 857.60] P:1936.00 E:0.087105 |  From Thomas Muller to give Germany a 1-0 lead.
[857.60 - 860.56] P:1950.92 E:0.074237 |  You're listening to Five Live from the first of the semi-finals.
[860.56 - 861.92] P:1942.10 E:0.092489 |  Much for Brazil to do now.
[861.92 - 863.76] P:1917.36 E:0.074843 |  Marcelo can't go forward.
[863.76 - 866.96] P:1882.03 E:0.077946 |  And the German side look all together now more settled
[866.96 - 869.44] P:1810.56 E:0.079568 |  outfit down there, rather torrid opening.
[869.44 - 871.28] P:1884.17 E:0.080197 |  The ball is with Hulk for Brazil.
[871.28 - 873.04] P:1894.00 E:0.083106 |  And I'm not quite sure what he's trying to do.
[873.04 - 875.20] P:1893.99 E:0.081453 |  He digs the ball down the right-hand side.
[875.20 - 877.60] P:1909.45 E:0.073059 |  But Bernard had come in from the touchline,
[877.60 - 879.28] P:1884.87 E:0.070188 |  and that's gone out of play.
[879.28 - 882.24] P:1809.82 E:0.075273 |  And what the Brazilians need to pick me up here.
[882.96 - 884.96] P:1891.04 E:0.082475 |  It's a throw-in to Germany.
[884.96 - 888.40] P:1861.41 E:0.074023 |  And interestingly, now they're just calming things down as well.
[888.40 - 889.44] P:1790.21 E:0.089227 |  They have the goal.
[889.44 - 891.52] P:1870.72 E:0.076072 |  Long way to go, though, still in the game.
[891.52 - 893.52] P:1903.38 E:0.086278 |  And the throw-in is taken towards closer.
[893.52 - 896.72] P:1885.27 E:0.076038 |  And as a pilt of handball, and it's given by the referee,
[896.72 - 898.80] P:1937.26 E:0.082190 |  free kick is quickly taken by Cruz.
[898.80 - 900.64] P:1838.26 E:0.075449 |  Nobody picked up Kedira.
[900.64 - 903.52] P:1839.31 E:0.073231 |  The Brazilians just a little slack at times with their marking.
[903.52 - 904.64] P:1888.93 E:0.078062 |  Cruz now.
[904.64 - 906.48] P:1935.86 E:0.090175 |  A challenge came in from Bernard.
[906.48 - 908.32] P:1990.48 E:0.064702 |  And it was rugged.
[908.32 - 911.20] P:1984.85 E:0.070708 |  And it's a free kick to Germany, short of the halfway line.
[911.28 - 913.36] P:1899.89 E:0.080918 |  I think the Germans are going to go down for free kicks
[913.36 - 914.56] P:1864.55 E:0.071145 |  at any opportunity.
[914.56 - 917.52] P:1884.71 E:0.085378 |  Any time a challenge comes in, they're going to ground.
[917.52 - 918.96] P:1850.43 E:0.078494 |  And I think they're trying to save the referee.
[918.96 - 921.20] P:1865.94 E:0.074951 |  Look, you cannot keep allowing this to go on.
[921.20 - 923.60] P:1846.99 E:0.080616 |  And again, that's a clear ploy after what happened
[923.60 - 925.04] P:1740.33 E:0.066591 |  in the last Brazilian game.
[926.24 - 929.12] P:1896.50 E:0.096741 |  I mean, what would have really upset Scolari here
[929.12 - 931.20] P:1850.94 E:0.077849 |  was that it was just a straightforward corner kick.
[931.20 - 933.52] P:1824.70 E:0.072721 |  And they would have spent a lot of time
[933.52 - 936.32] P:1782.53 E:0.074250 |  as now Germany moved towards the penalty area,
[936.32 - 937.68] P:1697.97 E:0.067543 |  but Louise is there.
[937.68 - 939.76] P:1722.99 E:0.083724 |  They presumably would have done all of their
[939.84 - 941.04] P:1754.37 E:0.085291 |  blackboard homework.
[941.04 - 944.72] P:1895.05 E:0.072109 |  They would have identified Hummels in particular as a danger.
[944.72 - 947.68] P:1892.28 E:0.070801 |  And in the end, nobody picked up Thomas Muller.
[947.68 - 950.80] P:1867.54 E:0.078450 |  And he wrapped the ball home for Germany with his right foot.
[950.80 - 954.80] P:1909.03 E:0.076142 |  And now Gustavo and Maicon trying to energise Brazil.
[954.80 - 957.36] P:1877.14 E:0.073057 |  Maicon for Fernandinho near side.
[957.36 - 958.96] P:1857.60 E:0.080768 |  Down the line, we haven't seen much of Bernardo.
[958.96 - 960.96] P:1974.95 E:0.089475 |  But that's a decent ball now for Maicon.
[960.96 - 962.08] P:1931.26 E:0.093954 |  Fred's in the area.
[962.08 - 963.84] P:1941.39 E:0.085433 |  Maicon can't get the ball though.
[963.84 - 965.76] P:1903.63 E:0.079446 |  In, it was blocked by Hoveders.
[966.40 - 968.24] P:1960.72 E:0.084003 |  And Erzl still struggling to make an impact
[968.24 - 969.68] P:1942.39 E:0.072038 |  down this left-hand side.
[969.68 - 972.72] P:1929.17 E:0.072524 |  And the ball is out of play for a German throw-in once more.
[972.72 - 975.84] P:1923.48 E:0.076734 |  We've played 16 minutes of the first half here,
[975.84 - 977.60] P:1783.38 E:0.066692 |  in better horizontal.
[977.60 - 979.60] P:1856.87 E:0.086465 |  And the hosts are up against it.
[979.60 - 980.96] P:1994.32 E:0.087404 |  Germany lead through Muller's goal.
[981.52 - 983.84] P:1990.77 E:0.085927 |  Very disappointing goal from Brazilian's point of view.
[983.84 - 985.20] P:1939.77 E:0.098269 |  Sometimes we saw with, like,
[985.20 - 988.00] P:1931.71 E:0.079372 |  Hummels-Rodriguez score an absolute wonder goal.
[988.00 - 990.32] P:1854.82 E:0.078488 |  You can't do an awful lot about that at times.
[990.32 - 991.92] P:1853.54 E:0.077186 |  But from a corner-asset piece,
[991.92 - 995.20] P:1861.97 E:0.073352 |  where a player loses concentration, loses marker,
[996.00 - 996.88] P:1872.73 E:0.071507 |  that's stoppable.
[996.88 - 997.76] P:1892.86 E:0.069460 |  That is preventable.
[998.00 - 1000.00] P:1914.38 E:0.076851 |  Scallari will be absolutely furious with David Luiz.
[1000.00 - 1001.44] P:1912.31 E:0.097273 |  Good ball from Oscar now to Hulk.
[1001.44 - 1003.28] P:1878.87 E:0.105006 |  And now Marcelo cuts into the penalty area.
[1003.28 - 1004.88] P:1958.56 E:0.097057 |  Driving run for Marcelo.
[1004.88 - 1006.72] P:1938.70 E:0.109547 |  He's gone down under the challenge from Laam,
[1006.72 - 1007.92] P:1917.10 E:0.085963 |  looking for a penalty.
[1007.92 - 1010.40] P:1932.25 E:0.092568 |  Referee has given a corner kick only,
[1010.40 - 1013.12] P:1991.80 E:0.091414 |  and one or two players square up on the edge of the six-yard area.
[1013.76 - 1014.72] P:1892.10 E:0.087124 |  No penalty for me.
[1014.72 - 1017.60] P:1909.24 E:0.085315 |  Philip Laam, I think he's going to struggle in this game
[1017.60 - 1018.48] P:1906.40 E:0.088441 |  with a pace.
[1018.48 - 1019.92] P:1956.04 E:0.085366 |  Players running out, and we've seen that.
[1019.92 - 1023.60] P:1920.61 E:0.076152 |  And I think that Brazilian are going to try and exploit that at times.
[1023.60 - 1025.92] P:1873.96 E:0.084765 |  But he dived in, tackled from behind.
[1025.92 - 1029.04] P:1899.06 E:0.085247 |  For me, clearly won the ball without seeing the replay.
[1029.04 - 1030.32] P:1819.97 E:0.078410 |  Right decision from the referee.
[1031.04 - 1033.04] P:1933.66 E:0.084894 |  Oscar threaded the ball through initially.
[1033.04 - 1034.24] P:1887.05 E:0.082628 |  He has to play well tonight,
[1034.24 - 1036.40] P:1899.18 E:0.076281 |  if Brazillor going to get into the World Cup final.
[1036.96 - 1038.88] P:1830.71 E:0.086138 |  Corner kick to Brazillor over on the far side.
[1038.88 - 1040.88] P:1818.91 E:0.075719 |  There are words now between the referee,
[1040.88 - 1042.72] P:1853.68 E:0.080666 |  and Marcelo, and also Bote.
[1042.72 - 1044.56] P:1914.28 E:0.083672 |  But we did see it in the first game, didn't we?
[1044.56 - 1047.12] P:1872.75 E:0.084169 |  You know, the referee's come under all sorts of pressure
[1047.12 - 1048.32] P:1835.24 E:0.079619 |  from the home crowd.
[1048.32 - 1049.92] P:1958.31 E:0.075239 |  Just seen it on the replay.
[1049.92 - 1050.72] P:1887.09 E:0.078913 |  Dead right.
[1050.72 - 1052.48] P:1943.51 E:0.079083 |  Fantastic challenge from Philip Laam.
[1052.48 - 1053.84] P:1934.71 E:0.076458 |  But he did get done with pace.
[1053.84 - 1055.12] P:1976.02 E:0.085099 |  Now, Germany scored from the corner,
[1055.20 - 1058.24] P:1871.64 E:0.082294 |  but this is a really poorly delivered corner by Brazillor.
[1058.24 - 1061.60] P:1849.10 E:0.073165 |  And they find themselves back on the half-way line now with Maikom.
[1061.60 - 1063.52] P:1843.01 E:0.082283 |  Germany leading 1-0 on five-lives.
[1063.52 - 1068.32] P:1945.92 E:0.089736 |  A great ball now from Marcelo to find Oscar inside the area.
[1068.32 - 1068.96] P:2003.25 E:0.100446 |  Oscar turns.
[1068.96 - 1072.32] P:1908.54 E:0.083081 |  That's been lifted up in the air by Hommels, the German defender.
[1072.32 - 1073.44] P:1968.77 E:0.084884 |  Oscar jumping again.
[1073.44 - 1075.52] P:1914.94 E:0.075162 |  Louise is supporting this latest attack.
[1075.52 - 1076.72] P:1989.65 E:0.097185 |  There'll always be danger, though,
[1076.72 - 1079.84] P:1920.81 E:0.073993 |  when Germany try and counterattack, looking for the flick-ons
[1079.84 - 1081.60] P:1879.60 E:0.087721 |  from the likes of Kloser and Muller.
[1082.24 - 1084.96] P:1895.62 E:0.081804 |  And now, Brazillor looked to Marcelo.
[1085.84 - 1088.16] P:1879.80 E:0.089422 |  The only thing that Jokam Lowe maybe will want more from
[1088.16 - 1089.92] P:1947.94 E:0.086317 |  is maybe Erzl down this left-hand side.
[1089.92 - 1091.92] P:1909.65 E:0.081239 |  The game is passing him by at the moment,
[1091.92 - 1095.44] P:1905.45 E:0.076012 |  but he won't mind the score line at least in his favour.
[1095.44 - 1098.64] P:1937.40 E:0.089383 |  All the... Most of the German danger is coming over on the right-hand side.
[1098.64 - 1100.56] P:1950.63 E:0.096833 |  And now Muller picks up the ball once more.
[1100.56 - 1103.12] P:1971.10 E:0.085543 |  Thomas Muller trying to thread the ball through for Kruse.
[1103.12 - 1105.12] P:1930.72 E:0.091176 |  Now, the Brazilians counterattack.
[1105.12 - 1107.84] P:1938.66 E:0.096308 |  Little Bernard on the half-way line, maybe running into trouble,
[1107.84 - 1110.40] P:1917.27 E:0.086989 |  invited the challenge, looked as if he was fouled by Kedira.
[1110.40 - 1111.92] P:1959.85 E:0.081203 |  Referees played advantage.
[1111.92 - 1114.24] P:1938.56 E:0.086725 |  Marcelo for Brazill, plenty of options.
[1114.32 - 1117.68] P:1884.88 E:0.083996 |  Oscars, though, disappointingly from the home side, played the ball back.
[1117.68 - 1121.28] P:1920.91 E:0.088195 |  Marcelo again is rampaging forward and then loses his way,
[1121.28 - 1122.48] P:1938.75 E:0.078919 |  and now he's out of position.
[1122.48 - 1125.52] P:1859.39 E:0.083365 |  And this is the problem. Muller is in space over on the far side.
[1125.52 - 1127.68] P:1892.52 E:0.094160 |  And when Marcelo goes forward, they have to cover.
[1128.24 - 1129.44] P:1931.74 E:0.067549 |  And they didn't.
[1129.44 - 1132.72] P:1888.05 E:0.083068 |  And fortunately for Brazill, the ball to Muller wasn't very good.
[1132.72 - 1134.56] P:1875.45 E:0.077670 |  It was too high for Muller to control.
[1134.56 - 1136.08] P:1826.95 E:0.075646 |  But that is a problem for them.
[1136.08 - 1139.76] P:1810.24 E:0.075847 |  Somebody does need to cover when Marcelo makes these runs forward.
[1139.76 - 1142.48] P:1857.74 E:0.081392 |  It's incredibly gung-ho, isn't it, from Brazill at the moment.
[1142.48 - 1145.20] P:1876.56 E:0.085534 |  They get the ball, they're running at people, chasing forward.
[1145.20 - 1148.48] P:1958.54 E:0.082933 |  They leave themselves exposed at the back at the times.
[1149.52 - 1151.52] P:1928.57 E:0.086684 |  Germany can keep themselves cool under pressure.
[1152.24 - 1154.48] P:1921.22 E:0.075889 |  Brazill could get hit quite easily on the counterattack.
[1154.48 - 1157.28] P:1850.19 E:0.091463 |  Well, because Muller is one of the best players in the world
[1157.28 - 1159.60] P:1924.28 E:0.084265 |  at exploiting exactly that kind of scenario.
[1160.40 - 1162.48] P:1937.88 E:0.086796 |  And now a ball from Dante.
[1162.48 - 1164.32] P:1942.83 E:0.099124 |  And Marcelo's loving to go forward here,
[1164.32 - 1166.40] P:1990.13 E:0.085218 |  but his problems are when he's having to defend.
[1166.40 - 1168.96] P:1927.90 E:0.077507 |  He's want to throw in over on the far side.
[1168.96 - 1172.24] P:1879.60 E:0.076543 |  This is where the likes of Gustavo have to come back in particular.
[1172.72 - 1176.64] P:1847.29 E:0.075194 |  And maybe Fernandinho when Marcelo decides to drive forward.
[1176.64 - 1179.20] P:1868.26 E:0.079610 |  Gustavo again, Germany leading 1-0.
[1179.20 - 1180.96] P:1852.63 E:0.080283 |  Gustavo finding Louise.
[1180.96 - 1183.76] P:1883.19 E:0.079698 |  And now Oscar just inside the German half.
[1183.76 - 1186.16] P:1898.43 E:0.071945 |  Fred hasn't had much to feed off so far.
[1186.16 - 1188.80] P:1899.20 E:0.083292 |  Maicon near side the Brazilian right.
[1188.80 - 1191.36] P:1931.10 E:0.079424 |  Good ball onto Oscar, though doesn't control it.
[1191.36 - 1193.20] P:1932.00 E:0.077264 |  Germany looking to try and counterattack.
[1193.20 - 1195.76] P:1890.86 E:0.077362 |  Schweinsteiger who's just sitting in front of the back four,
[1195.76 - 1198.24] P:1967.41 E:0.093186 |  looking to release Erzal down this near side.
[1198.24 - 1201.04] P:1986.70 E:0.094139 |  Erzal gets, gets it in and tries to get away from Louise,
[1201.12 - 1205.28] P:2004.36 E:0.081118 |  who just gets his body in the way and gives the ball back to his goalkeeper.
[1205.28 - 1209.36] P:1989.56 E:0.070561 |  Giulio Cesar, who now clears, non-too effectively.
[1209.36 - 1213.44] P:1976.10 E:0.076590 |  Bernhard comes in and then just gives the ball away back to the German midfield.
[1213.44 - 1216.48] P:1975.45 E:0.076898 |  And that German midfield now starting to assert itself.
[1216.48 - 1217.60] P:1983.52 E:0.095304 |  Ball played down the centre.
[1217.60 - 1219.52] P:2005.80 E:0.091990 |  Lovely flick to Miroslav, closer.
[1219.52 - 1223.36] P:2056.85 E:0.087277 |  Closer though, on the edge of the area is outnumbered by Yellowshirts.
[1223.92 - 1227.92] P:1944.24 E:0.077196 |  Giulio Cesar gets the back pass and then can only find touch with his clearance.
[1228.56 - 1230.96] P:1877.42 E:0.076933 |  All a little bit panicky in that Brazilian defence
[1230.96 - 1233.12] P:1865.76 E:0.072380 |  when Germany get the ball in decent possession.
[1233.68 - 1236.56] P:1840.96 E:0.077783 |  And I said, this is almost what we expected from the start.
[1236.56 - 1239.92] P:1914.44 E:0.081147 |  Brazil frantic at times, chasing all over the place.
[1240.56 - 1242.64] P:1945.37 E:0.088876 |  Germany playing very, very cool.
[1242.64 - 1244.80] P:2015.00 E:0.085140 |  Yeah, using all the tactical nows that they have.
[1245.84 - 1250.00] P:2028.66 E:0.085513 |  Germany leading 1-0 and moving towards the midway point of the first half.
[1250.00 - 1252.48] P:1990.22 E:0.076663 |  Now, Boateng's got a lot of space, the defender.
[1252.48 - 1254.72] P:2036.79 E:0.083433 |  Boateng now up towards the edge of the area.
[1254.72 - 1257.52] P:1995.81 E:0.076797 |  Back again to Boateng, again that man Muller is waiting.
[1257.60 - 1258.64] P:1991.49 E:0.087607 |  Kedira has it.
[1258.64 - 1260.08] P:2038.21 E:0.091446 |  Little wrestling match with Bernard.
[1260.08 - 1265.28] P:1996.10 E:0.088217 |  This is danger here though, as the shot is driven in then low and without any power from closer.
[1266.08 - 1270.64] P:1957.75 E:0.087252 |  But the Germans are starting to create positions here to trouble Scolari's side.
[1270.64 - 1273.20] P:1930.74 E:0.065937 |  And there is much to sort out defensively.
[1273.20 - 1275.20] P:1970.05 E:0.085403 |  The ball is now down below us with Fred.
[1275.68 - 1276.80] P:1938.04 E:0.071688 |  He finds Maicon.
[1276.80 - 1280.32] P:1960.80 E:0.082938 |  Maicon's going to have to hold this because there's nobody really in an advanced position.
[1280.88 - 1282.48] P:1886.95 E:0.087248 |  Oscar helps him out on the halfway.
[1283.20 - 1284.48] P:1911.46 E:0.083963 |  Oscar to Fernandinho.
[1284.48 - 1286.16] P:1850.12 E:0.086223 |  In comes a snapping challenge from Bruce.
[1286.80 - 1288.24] P:1900.03 E:0.079163 |  Brazilians keep it.
[1288.24 - 1291.36] P:1898.27 E:0.096917 |  And now Louise hits one of those diagonal balls to the far side of the field.
[1291.36 - 1295.44] P:1908.59 E:0.085336 |  It rears up at Marcelo and he's done very well to keep it in.
[1295.44 - 1297.60] P:1946.02 E:0.083675 |  Now Hulk trying to shake off the defenders.
[1297.60 - 1301.44] P:1920.78 E:0.086986 |  Hulk played it forward towards Fred, but the Germans are defending well.
[1301.44 - 1303.84] P:1934.88 E:0.098278 |  And now here they go again down the right-hand side.
[1303.84 - 1306.00] P:1977.84 E:0.092485 |  And once more galloping down the right is Muller.
[1306.56 - 1308.88] P:2034.64 E:0.087206 |  Brazilians, Gustavo trying to come back.
[1308.88 - 1313.44] P:1989.26 E:0.082861 |  Ball played in by Muller, but at the near post it was cleared for throwing over on the far side.
[1313.44 - 1314.40] P:1955.05 E:0.075143 |  1-0 to Germany.
[1314.96 - 1317.12] P:1932.34 E:0.070173 |  I think Brazilians are going to have to change something.
[1317.12 - 1318.64] P:1909.25 E:0.082609 |  They're too cavalier at the moment.
[1318.64 - 1319.60] P:1888.83 E:0.063912 |  They're going forward.
[1319.60 - 1322.40] P:1971.92 E:0.082421 |  Marcelo is charging down that left-hand side.
[1322.40 - 1325.12] P:1948.32 E:0.087243 |  But when they give it away, they're just getting hit on the counter-attack.
[1325.12 - 1328.24] P:1968.35 E:0.098742 |  And Fernandinho's completely missed that ball and Tony Cruce has got it.
[1328.24 - 1329.44] P:1956.48 E:0.097212 |  It's gone into the area to Muller.
[1329.44 - 1330.64] P:2023.73 E:0.097133 |  And there's a chance for Closer.
[1330.64 - 1333.28] P:2042.13 E:0.100178 |  Great save from Cesar, but Closer's there!
[1333.28 - 1336.32] P:1936.18 E:0.094332 |  Second time round to break Ronaldo's record.
[1336.32 - 1340.40] P:1866.23 E:0.098715 |  Against all teams, he's done it against Brazilians in the semi-final.
[1340.40 - 1343.84] P:1895.12 E:0.093723 |  His sixth-deep goal in World Cup finals.
[1343.84 - 1345.20] P:1846.32 E:0.096755 |  It's a new record.
[1345.20 - 1347.52] P:1918.46 E:0.090530 |  It gives Germany a 2-0 lead.
[1347.52 - 1349.52] P:1841.06 E:0.090436 |  And is there any way back now for the hosts?
[1350.16 - 1351.04] P:1834.68 E:0.092444 |  Brazil at times.
[1351.04 - 1353.12] P:1822.31 E:0.081201 |  The fence has been in absolute shambles.
[1353.12 - 1354.72] P:1744.94 E:0.093633 |  Players all over the place.
[1354.72 - 1356.72] P:1857.33 E:0.087287 |  A square ball played into the middle.
[1356.72 - 1359.20] P:1805.99 E:0.086508 |  Fernandinho took his eye off it.
[1359.20 - 1360.32] P:1895.83 E:0.094131 |  It should have been cut out.
[1360.32 - 1361.36] P:1814.23 E:0.077065 |  It wasn't.
[1361.36 - 1365.28] P:1805.36 E:0.089842 |  And then when the ball came in, a little 1-2 on the edge of the box.
[1365.84 - 1368.80] P:1869.64 E:0.085685 |  Closer, Muller has the first chance.
[1368.80 - 1372.40] P:1868.45 E:0.084032 |  It's a decent save, but it comes straight back out to Closer.
[1372.40 - 1373.52] P:1852.07 E:0.077541 |  It just tucks it away.
[1373.60 - 1375.76] P:1845.58 E:0.085735 |  Very, very simple finish in the end.
[1375.76 - 1378.24] P:1808.46 E:0.089698 |  But Brazil all over the shop.
[1378.24 - 1380.40] P:1841.75 E:0.086096 |  Clearly missing Thiago Silva.
[1380.40 - 1381.60] P:1874.51 E:0.097192 |  A moment of history.
[1381.60 - 1387.04] P:1856.51 E:0.090113 |  A Brazilian World Cup record broken in the semi-final against them by a German player.
[1387.04 - 1388.80] P:1823.31 E:0.094882 |  It's the halfway point of the first half.
[1388.80 - 1390.96] P:1905.05 E:0.090198 |  Germany lead 2-0, and here's Ian Dennis.
[1391.76 - 1392.40] P:1831.07 E:0.083485 |  Thank you, Mike.
[1393.04 - 1397.68] P:1871.33 E:0.086600 |  Just said to Mark Purgac before taking over the commentary duties.
[1397.68 - 1398.48] P:1884.35 E:0.084802 |  Blumfontein.
[1399.44 - 1401.12] P:1800.97 E:0.098855 |  Every time, Germany are going forward.
[1401.12 - 1402.80] P:1781.64 E:0.086269 |  I can't help but think of Blumfontein.
[1402.80 - 1409.36] P:1916.67 E:0.088028 |  I think every English fan who was in that stadium was hurt as the ball is over the top towards Bernardo
[1409.36 - 1411.28] P:1980.33 E:0.092690 |  and haunted by the way that Germany...
[1412.80 - 1415.68] P:1934.53 E:0.090334 |  How ruthless they were, but the same thing is happening here.
[1415.68 - 1419.92] P:1914.68 E:0.076656 |  They've got the goal in front before the second goal, and they're picking Brazil off.
[1419.92 - 1422.80] P:1887.24 E:0.080138 |  And it's no surprise to see them get the second,
[1422.80 - 1424.96] P:1846.53 E:0.080693 |  and I won't be surprised if they win three or four.
[1425.52 - 1428.80] P:1844.60 E:0.082257 |  Well, it's been a little bit too easy for Germany going forward at the moment,
[1428.80 - 1432.32] P:1925.99 E:0.087365 |  but I said before the game, all the passion, all the fire in the bellies,
[1432.40 - 1436.72] P:1900.49 E:0.087501 |  but the Germans, as we know, have ice in their blood, a very calm under pressure.
[1436.72 - 1437.36] P:1928.65 E:0.068606 |  Clinical.
[1437.36 - 1439.68] P:1937.06 E:0.101642 |  Larmus forward on the right-hand side, Moolas missed it.
[1439.68 - 1440.80] P:2092.67 E:0.096337 |  Cross for the shots.
[1440.80 - 1442.00] P:2079.69 E:0.106437 |  There's the third goal.
[1442.88 - 1443.68] P:2082.82 E:0.111229 |  Fiercely struck.
[1445.12 - 1446.72] P:1872.04 E:0.102430 |  Low, left-footed.
[1446.72 - 1451.04] P:1978.36 E:0.092008 |  Cesar had no chance, and Germany now lead Brazil 3-0.
[1451.60 - 1458.00] P:1950.08 E:0.092004 |  And in a stadium that he's soaked in yellow, a black cloud looms large in Bellahorizonte.
[1458.96 - 1459.68] P:1815.58 E:0.101726 |  Unbelievable.
[1460.24 - 1461.60] P:1833.76 E:0.095972 |  Simply unbelievable.
[1461.60 - 1464.64] P:1849.36 E:0.093494 |  Just looking at some of the faces of the Brazilian players.
[1464.64 - 1466.96] P:1888.43 E:0.089319 |  We get close-ups on the monitors, the fans.
[1468.00 - 1468.96] P:1960.22 E:0.113076 |  They are in shock.
[1469.52 - 1471.20] P:1896.23 E:0.082686 |  Deep, deep shock.
[1471.20 - 1473.76] P:1866.59 E:0.084604 |  Again, it was a simple goal that should have been cut out.
[1473.76 - 1475.04] P:1870.67 E:0.084701 |  And it's Larmus cross.
[1475.04 - 1476.48] P:1877.58 E:0.093710 |  Moola missed the first opportunity.
[1476.48 - 1477.76] P:1827.94 E:0.085068 |  It was pretty much unmarked.
[1477.76 - 1482.64] P:1897.35 E:0.084629 |  It came to Tony Cruz at the far side of the box, and just drove it in at the near post.
[1482.64 - 1484.00] P:1769.31 E:0.083786 |  Moola completely unmarked.
[1484.00 - 1485.68] P:1857.72 E:0.080473 |  Cruz completely unmarked.
[1485.68 - 1487.12] P:1933.76 E:0.098032 |  Brazil 3-0 down.
[1487.84 - 1488.64] P:1808.33 E:0.089237 |  Devastating.
[1489.60 - 1497.28] P:1811.40 E:0.084298 |  There is a hum around the stadium, but the Brazilian balloons have had those balloons
[1497.28 - 1503.52] P:1876.61 E:0.089583 |  popped, with the exception of a large chunk of white, of the German support away to our right-hand
[1503.52 - 1506.00] P:1783.98 E:0.081663 |  side, who are jumping up and down.
[1506.00 - 1507.36] P:2005.24 E:0.091585 |  In fact, they're threatening again.
[1507.36 - 1508.40] P:1971.36 E:0.099573 |  Here is Kadeera.
[1508.40 - 1509.84] P:2063.99 E:0.090757 |  Kadeera back to Cruz.
[1509.84 - 1510.96] P:2031.64 E:0.099595 |  It's a second goal.
[1511.52 - 1517.20] P:1963.50 E:0.098745 |  Brazil are capitulating, and the Germans are romping their way through to the final in the American R.
[1517.68 - 1518.88] P:1924.84 E:0.098237 |  Brazil 0.
[1518.88 - 1520.08] P:2023.16 E:0.095713 |  Germany 4.
[1520.08 - 1520.80] P:1955.13 E:0.100870 |  Unbelievable.
[1522.32 - 1523.28] P:1942.31 E:0.097714 |  Almost speechless.
[1523.28 - 1526.56] P:1957.92 E:0.096552 |  We've just seen a little child in the crowd crying his eyes out.
[1527.36 - 1529.04] P:1890.02 E:0.092940 |  This is, we never expected this.
[1529.04 - 1534.16] P:1900.12 E:0.087760 |  And after the start, where Brazil started quite well, they've just been hit on the counterattack
[1534.16 - 1536.16] P:1897.05 E:0.081406 |  time and time again.
[1536.16 - 1538.24] P:1850.75 E:0.086698 |  Brazil have gone completely at the moment.
[1538.24 - 1541.84] P:1895.30 E:0.090688 |  This could end up 7 or 8 in a World Cup semi-final.
[1542.40 - 1545.36] P:1833.98 E:0.091596 |  Brazil at the moment have got no answer to this at all.
[1545.60 - 1546.88] P:1830.77 E:0.057380 |  There are shambles.
[1546.88 - 1549.60] P:1964.82 E:0.095374 |  There are absolute shambles at the back, Brazil.
[1550.08 - 1553.68] P:1893.65 E:0.084870 |  And Germany are taking full advantage and some.
[1554.80 - 1561.36] P:1838.35 E:0.084655 |  And now all of a sudden, we've got a scenario where Brazil as the host nation have just got to
[1561.36 - 1563.36] P:1788.67 E:0.076534 |  damage limitation.
[1565.36 - 1568.88] P:1860.13 E:0.088788 |  Supporters are in tears around us here in Belo Horizonte.
[1571.36 - 1572.24] P:1708.53 E:0.061491 |  Unbelievable.
[1572.24 - 1573.12] P:1787.88 E:0.088072 |  Unbelievable.
[1574.48 - 1579.68] P:1866.61 E:0.091447 |  When I said that I could see Germany winning 3 or 4, I didn't necessarily mean, within 4 minutes of
[1579.68 - 1583.52] P:1869.40 E:0.082752 |  picking up the commentary mic, that they're going to add two more goals.
[1584.32 - 1584.96] P:2099.14 E:0.107749 |  Shell shot.
[1586.00 - 1589.12] P:1958.80 E:0.090031 |  The nation of Brazil is absolutely shell shot.
[1590.08 - 1592.16] P:1863.82 E:0.086782 |  An example of how clinical Germany have been.
[1592.16 - 1595.36] P:1809.32 E:0.079790 |  I think they've had four shots on target and they've scored four goals.
[1595.36 - 1599.12] P:1810.29 E:0.083709 |  They might have had five shots on target, but they have been exceptional.
[1600.08 - 1602.16] P:1795.30 E:0.081815 |  Clinical, efficient.
[1603.44 - 1606.00] P:1879.98 E:0.091956 |  Schweinsteiger sits in front of the back four.
[1606.00 - 1609.28] P:1871.49 E:0.086770 |  All that passion, all that flair from the Brazilians in the first few minutes.
[1609.76 - 1612.64] P:1830.10 E:0.084124 |  You know, I'm looking at, I'm trying to find David Luiz now on the pitch.
[1612.64 - 1616.48] P:1912.32 E:0.083639 |  He should be playing centre half and he stood halfway up the pitch in midfield.
[1617.04 - 1618.88] P:1842.05 E:0.090860 |  This was always going to be a problem.
[1618.88 - 1622.00] P:1883.15 E:0.084198 |  Once they considered that first goal, their heads have now dropped.
[1622.64 - 1624.24] P:1710.32 E:0.095926 |  They are all over the place.
[1624.24 - 1627.60] P:1745.79 E:0.081320 |  Big fill on the touch line, throwing his hands in the air.
[1628.56 - 1631.12] P:1830.66 E:0.085892 |  You have to say 4-0, that's it, game over.
[1631.12 - 1633.92] P:1844.75 E:0.083980 |  And it really could be a case of how many the Germans want to score now.
[1634.80 - 1638.00] P:1807.69 E:0.086786 |  Throw from Marcelo. Chested off by Fred.
[1638.00 - 1640.96] P:1890.92 E:0.088041 |  Ball played back in. Bernhard is coming forward now.
[1640.96 - 1642.40] P:1919.96 E:0.094490 |  Bernhard then towards Holt.
[1642.40 - 1645.12] P:1907.53 E:0.091490 |  Mijkon on the overlap on the right-hand side, if he wants him.
[1645.12 - 1647.36] P:1953.04 E:0.085615 |  Tried to flick the ball with his left foot in field.
[1647.36 - 1649.60] P:1914.66 E:0.084633 |  Collected that loose ball by Fernandinho.
[1649.60 - 1650.96] P:1836.19 E:0.086305 |  They'll run on this right-hand side.
[1650.96 - 1652.56] P:2025.26 E:0.082528 |  Yellow shirts and blue shorts.
[1652.56 - 1654.48] P:1954.17 E:0.077078 |  Playing from left to right as we look.
[1654.48 - 1656.96] P:1892.59 E:0.078672 |  Plays it back towards Mijkon, right-hand side.
[1657.04 - 1659.84] P:1844.93 E:0.075271 |  Prouded out by three German players.
[1659.84 - 1663.28] P:1889.32 E:0.075596 |  And Hubertes will be the one who will just clear it out of play.
[1663.28 - 1664.96] P:1806.03 E:0.072946 |  And it'll be a Brazilian throw.
[1664.96 - 1667.36] P:1905.47 E:0.070884 |  Mijkon to take it. Here is Holt.
[1667.36 - 1669.20] P:1863.40 E:0.075353 |  Right corner of the penalty area.
[1669.20 - 1672.16] P:1912.95 E:0.079633 |  Holt caught by Hubertes.
[1672.16 - 1674.48] P:1897.70 E:0.080669 |  No, Holt goes to ground too easily.
[1674.48 - 1677.12] P:1906.22 E:0.081065 |  And that says the referee is a goal kick.
[1678.88 - 1681.68] P:1915.00 E:0.100702 |  Orafa Honigstein back in our studio in Rio.
[1681.68 - 1684.08] P:1868.49 E:0.081547 |  What do you make of this scoreline? 4-0 to Germany.
[1684.88 - 1688.80] P:1749.32 E:0.100474 |  It's hard to believe really, especially if you consider Germany had such a shaky start.
[1688.80 - 1690.48] P:1628.51 E:0.085767 |  They looked nervous in the first five minutes.
[1690.48 - 1691.76] P:1557.44 E:0.084515 |  They gave the ball away.
[1691.76 - 1693.36] P:1742.45 E:0.070868 |  Brazil took the game to them.
[1693.36 - 1695.68] P:1720.06 E:0.084539 |  Everything changed after the Mule goal.
[1695.68 - 1699.92] P:1766.22 E:0.080432 |  Brazil suddenly, I think, felt the danger of getting knocked out in Germany.
[1699.92 - 1701.68] P:1718.29 E:0.076604 |  The confidence just took them.
[1701.68 - 1703.12] P:1604.30 E:0.082220 |  And every time they went forward, they scored.
[1704.48 - 1705.84] P:1885.39 E:0.074590 |  Three goals in four minutes.
[1706.88 - 1708.16] P:1784.27 E:0.080343 |  They were blitz with Brazil.
[1710.96 - 1713.12] P:1968.30 E:0.104235 |  We'll have further discussions, I'm sure, with...
[1714.56 - 1716.32] P:1831.61 E:0.095753 |  With a referee half-time.
[1716.32 - 1717.20] P:1939.19 E:0.095023 |  Germany 4-0.
[1718.32 - 1719.04] P:1726.48 E:0.095602 |  Brazil 0-0.
[1720.24 - 1723.12] P:1842.36 E:0.084566 |  Not an only one for statistics here, but again, a percentage.
[1723.12 - 1724.08] P:1871.63 E:0.087992 |  Percentage of play.
[1724.08 - 1726.72] P:1877.91 E:0.078893 |  Brazil 65% almost of the play.
[1726.72 - 1727.92] P:1983.76 E:0.106222 |  They're in again here, Germany.
[1727.92 - 1728.80] P:2057.01 E:0.104000 |  This is Kedera.
[1728.80 - 1729.68] P:2088.00 E:0.093808 |  He's got options.
[1729.68 - 1731.04] P:2082.82 E:0.100808 |  He's pulled the ball back to Erzl.
[1731.04 - 1732.48] P:2092.22 E:0.102895 |  Here is Kedera again.
[1732.48 - 1734.88] P:2004.17 E:0.104453 |  And Kedera strokes the ball in right footed.
[1735.44 - 1737.68] P:1954.41 E:0.092292 |  It's a fifth goal for Germany.
[1737.68 - 1740.08] P:2038.33 E:0.101480 |  It's truly astonishing in Belo Horizonte.
[1740.80 - 1742.88] P:1995.17 E:0.095289 |  Germany a running riot.
[1742.88 - 1744.16] P:1965.37 E:0.088672 |  Brazil 0.
[1744.16 - 1745.84] P:2045.85 E:0.084410 |  Germany 5.
[1745.84 - 1747.44] P:2031.05 E:0.102831 |  We haven't even played half an hour.
[1749.04 - 1750.64] P:1919.37 E:0.084408 |  Defences capitulated.
[1752.32 - 1753.28] P:1855.41 E:0.103703 |  Really don't know what to say.
[1753.28 - 1757.28] P:1929.91 E:0.086705 |  But the whole stadium is almost just silence in shock.
[1758.16 - 1759.04] P:1960.62 E:0.096678 |  It's just incredible.
[1759.04 - 1760.56] P:1960.61 E:0.089876 |  That was so easy.
[1761.92 - 1763.68] P:1863.64 E:0.099917 |  Erzl, you know, just dropping the ball back.
[1763.68 - 1765.60] P:1844.35 E:0.086140 |  Kedera could have shot first time.
[1765.60 - 1767.04] P:1823.51 E:0.085970 |  No, waits for Erzl.
[1767.60 - 1769.12] P:1751.82 E:0.085177 |  Gets the ball back on the second one.
[1769.68 - 1770.56] P:1788.40 E:0.099087 |  Slots the ball home.
[1771.36 - 1773.36] P:1759.17 E:0.075772 |  I really don't know what to say.
[1773.36 - 1779.36] P:1789.14 E:0.078917 |  You know, I think the romantics in this wanted Brazil to be in the final.
[1779.36 - 1781.84] P:1727.17 E:0.078039 |  In the American R, maybe it's Argentina.
[1781.84 - 1783.36] P:1876.05 E:0.089573 |  But fair play to the Germans.
[1783.36 - 1784.96] P:1846.42 E:0.074047 |  They have been exceptional.
[1784.96 - 1787.44] P:1893.68 E:0.084985 |  Apart from that first maybe 10, 15 minutes or so
[1787.44 - 1789.36] P:1873.73 E:0.077188 |  where they came up with a little bit of pressure.
[1789.36 - 1790.32] P:1861.25 E:0.094657 |  They remain calm.
[1791.12 - 1793.92] P:1886.93 E:0.075112 |  Noia didn't really have a save to make in that time.
[1794.48 - 1796.96] P:1866.12 E:0.068551 |  But they have been clinical.
[1796.96 - 1799.92] P:1857.64 E:0.066776 |  Exceptional when going forward.
[1800.88 - 1801.92] P:1823.70 E:0.088123 |  On the counterattack.
[1802.48 - 1804.08] P:1856.30 E:0.084214 |  And they have put this Brazilian side.
[1804.08 - 1808.00] P:1791.40 E:0.072191 |  They've made them look defensively worse than schoolboys.
[1808.64 - 1810.48] P:1913.86 E:0.102711 |  My worry now inside the stadium
[1810.48 - 1814.80] P:1950.97 E:0.082623 |  is that this could really turn quite ugly in terms of the atmosphere.
[1814.80 - 1817.60] P:1889.30 E:0.086462 |  Because wherever you look, particularly way to our right hand side now,
[1817.60 - 1820.48] P:1931.98 E:0.086884 |  there are more and more stewards in their luminous orange jackets.
[1821.28 - 1825.04] P:1954.52 E:0.085308 |  And Brazil trailing by five goals to nil.
[1825.04 - 1826.80] P:1982.41 E:0.084403 |  If there was a concede more goals,
[1827.44 - 1829.76] P:2040.64 E:0.093776 |  not only would it be a national humiliation,
[1830.48 - 1834.72] P:1972.54 E:0.077264 |  but I think then it could quickly turn from that carnival atmosphere
[1834.72 - 1836.88] P:1975.81 E:0.075428 |  to something a little bit more sinister.
[1836.88 - 1839.92] P:2026.32 E:0.091366 |  Tim Vickery is also in our studio alongside Rafa Honigstein. Tim.
[1840.96 - 1842.16] P:1650.71 E:0.112898 |  Yeah, you do worry about this.
[1842.16 - 1846.24] P:1673.66 E:0.087682 |  You worry about the way that crowd are capable of turning on their own players.
[1846.88 - 1849.36] P:1757.34 E:0.084520 |  I knew some of the players from 1950.
[1849.36 - 1853.52] P:1863.46 E:0.094702 |  A great side who lost 2-1 in the last few minutes to Uruguay.
[1853.52 - 1856.40] P:1788.86 E:0.071847 |  They were never, ever able to forget it.
[1856.40 - 1857.76] P:1774.31 E:0.104690 |  One of them told me years afterwards,
[1857.76 - 1860.56] P:1664.29 E:0.081296 |  he was still worried about people coming at him with a knife
[1860.56 - 1862.08] P:1805.26 E:0.062654 |  because he lost that game.
[1862.08 - 1866.16] P:1758.31 E:0.084291 |  Now, Denau, you mentioned there, if there's more goals, it might be a humiliation.
[1866.16 - 1870.08] P:1745.90 E:0.082477 |  I think after the third goal, we are already in humiliation territory.
[1870.08 - 1873.20] P:1831.22 E:0.079104 |  Defensive line for Brazil, an absolute shambles.
[1873.20 - 1875.52] P:1736.32 E:0.096382 |  And if you were giving points out of 10 so far,
[1876.08 - 1879.44] P:1780.37 E:0.098120 |  you might give Fernandinho one for putting his shirt on the right way around.
[1880.00 - 1884.56] P:1749.57 E:0.093315 |  An absolute shambolic performance from the man who's supposed to protect
[1885.04 - 1887.12] P:1640.88 E:0.083006 |  the centre-backs.
[1887.12 - 1888.88] P:1752.17 E:0.089238 |  They're all over the place defensively.
[1892.08 - 1895.44] P:1794.94 E:0.096544 |  I think you've picked up very well on the fear for the atmosphere here.
[1895.44 - 1896.64] P:2035.52 E:0.094393 |  Here is Lawn. Lawn pulls the ball back.
[1896.64 - 1898.56] P:2040.43 E:0.091050 |  Gros, sticks and deflection goes wide.
[1899.28 - 1903.28] P:2002.31 E:0.095282 |  They are exposing Brazil time and time and time again.
[1905.36 - 1907.04] P:1961.98 E:0.095450 |  And it's a corner kick to Germany.
[1907.04 - 1908.16] P:1916.56 E:0.072159 |  Five-nil.
[1908.16 - 1911.52] P:1856.37 E:0.087562 |  Every time Germany come forward, they look like scoring.
[1911.52 - 1913.60] P:1969.28 E:0.081738 |  Corner is taken short on the left-hand side.
[1913.60 - 1914.40] P:1993.15 E:0.088239 |  Here is Erzl.
[1915.44 - 1916.96] P:1982.27 E:0.100821 |  This now is Schweinsteiger.
[1917.52 - 1920.40] P:1960.99 E:0.090907 |  Schweinsteiger with a short-daggle ball to Kaderer.
[1920.40 - 1921.36] P:1935.36 E:0.090588 |  Back to Boateng.
[1922.48 - 1926.40] P:1902.56 E:0.084851 |  Every German player is inside the Brazilian half.
[1926.40 - 1928.80] P:1958.68 E:0.078273 |  Lawn with a cross, takes a slight deflection.
[1928.80 - 1932.64] P:1907.21 E:0.080773 |  The Fred, who's been anonymous, is back doing some defensive work.
[1934.00 - 1937.36] P:1969.04 E:0.093316 |  And bearing in mind that Germany scored five before the half-hour,
[1937.84 - 1943.36] P:1862.55 E:0.078608 |  it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the biggest margin of victory
[1943.92 - 1946.16] P:1871.33 E:0.085784 |  in a World Cup is nine goals.
[1946.88 - 1951.20] P:1921.53 E:0.088102 |  You wouldn't rule out, bearing in mind that they've scored five before the half-hour.
[1951.20 - 1954.88] P:1907.21 E:0.086500 |  How many more, then, will they add between now and the 90-minute mark?
[1955.52 - 1957.92] P:1875.12 E:0.097648 |  I'm sure Kroosl will be thinking, how many more can I add?
[1958.56 - 1960.64] P:1820.39 E:0.092159 |  Thomas Muller as well, how many more can I get?
[1960.64 - 1962.72] P:1892.76 E:0.085464 |  Kroosl slows records as well.
[1962.72 - 1966.40] P:1955.13 E:0.081437 |  David Luiz has just sighed into the back of Muller.
[1966.40 - 1967.84] P:1898.16 E:0.089938 |  And that's also another worry.
[1967.84 - 1971.84] P:1867.74 E:0.079231 |  We know that these Brazilians are a little bit hot-headed at times.
[1971.84 - 1972.88] P:1844.01 E:0.083337 |  It could spill over.
[1973.52 - 1978.24] P:1863.81 E:0.076985 |  I wouldn't surprise them at some point if a Brazilian loses cool and gets a red card.
[1978.88 - 1980.32] P:1887.42 E:0.077069 |  It's a nightmare for Brazil.
[1981.84 - 1984.48] P:1968.95 E:0.101077 |  It is a nightmare where they're 5-0 down.
[1984.48 - 1986.80] P:2019.31 E:0.093601 |  We've got 13 minutes to go to halftime.
[1986.80 - 1989.36] P:1899.92 E:0.098820 |  It is a remarkable scoreline here on Five Live.
[1990.16 - 1994.72] P:1914.48 E:0.085802 |  I would think that tomorrow's semi-final would be a lot tighter in Sao Paulo,
[1994.80 - 1996.24] P:1919.52 E:0.091182 |  Argentina against Holland.
[1997.04 - 2001.04] P:1917.85 E:0.089823 |  We'll get a two-hour build-up ahead of that nine-o-clock kickoff from Sao Paulo.
[2001.04 - 2003.68] P:1898.39 E:0.082454 |  And, of course, Sunday's final in the Maracanar.
[2004.24 - 2008.88] P:1910.95 E:0.081086 |  A week ago, I sat in the Copa Cabana as here is Kadeira.
[2009.84 - 2012.96] P:1878.84 E:0.090611 |  And it's Kroosl, closed down by Finandinho,
[2012.96 - 2016.08] P:1850.78 E:0.078744 |  trying to thread that ball through towards Laam.
[2016.08 - 2019.92] P:1861.34 E:0.085639 |  And I said with Jonathan Overand that I could see Germany picking off Brazil.
[2020.72 - 2024.56] P:1827.06 E:0.088691 |  But I never, and I don't think anybody envisaged this scenario.
[2024.72 - 2027.44] P:1900.42 E:0.087460 |  And certainly this scoreline, Danny Mills, never in a million years.
[2027.44 - 2029.84] P:1849.94 E:0.075572 |  You'd have never gone out and put, you know...
[2030.64 - 2033.28] P:1905.11 E:0.082297 |  I don't think you've even put maybe four-0, you know,
[2033.28 - 2035.52] P:1877.91 E:0.084938 |  as a bet over the course of the whole game.
[2035.52 - 2038.80] P:1861.46 E:0.079403 |  Now, this is likely to end up six, seven, you know, as you said.
[2039.36 - 2042.00] P:1882.79 E:0.080904 |  Nine is the record. Would be incredible.
[2042.96 - 2047.04] P:1917.78 E:0.069478 |  Just Germany have just been stereotypical.
[2047.04 - 2049.60] P:1899.96 E:0.085803 |  And they've been German. They've been efficient. They've been clinical.
[2049.60 - 2050.80] P:1976.94 E:0.078163 |  Here is Closet.
[2050.80 - 2052.80] P:1905.81 E:0.099445 |  Closet runs the man over on that far side.
[2052.80 - 2054.96] P:1979.61 E:0.097578 |  He's locked to go through the middle towards Kadeira.
[2055.60 - 2058.08] P:1929.87 E:0.095279 |  And in fact, they had even had Erzel on the left-hand side.
[2058.80 - 2061.60] P:1947.02 E:0.093266 |  In their red and black horizontal striped shirts,
[2061.60 - 2065.68] P:1898.95 E:0.074951 |  Germany are going forward at every opportunity
[2066.72 - 2069.12] P:1930.05 E:0.086835 |  and look like they're going to score at every opportunity.
[2070.88 - 2075.52] P:1825.28 E:0.088539 |  It is unbelievable how that the Brazilian defence is all over the shop.
[2076.40 - 2078.88] P:1906.01 E:0.093034 |  David Luiz, supposed to be the other, the Marshal,
[2078.88 - 2082.32] P:1814.11 E:0.081173 |  was hoping that he was going to step up to the plate.
[2082.88 - 2083.44] P:1878.11 E:0.097624 |  Not at all.
[2084.16 - 2087.04] P:1865.92 E:0.092980 |  Louis Gustavo in the middle, Fernandinho in non-existent.
[2087.04 - 2089.52] P:1837.46 E:0.091995 |  I talked about that really important square,
[2089.52 - 2092.40] P:1823.70 E:0.084336 |  that block of four players, the two-centre midfield players,
[2092.40 - 2093.76] P:1860.63 E:0.066118 |  the two-centre defenders.
[2093.76 - 2095.12] P:1884.18 E:0.095253 |  That's where you get hurt.
[2095.76 - 2098.88] P:1872.06 E:0.075069 |  And that has been incredibly weak for Brazil.
[2098.88 - 2102.16] P:1899.27 E:0.076803 |  Laam to Mula. Mula in field to Erzel.
[2102.16 - 2104.00] P:1820.84 E:0.087251 |  Challenge comes in from Fernandinho.
[2104.00 - 2106.40] P:1945.59 E:0.074016 |  Croce will pick up that ball closer.
[2106.40 - 2111.04] P:1923.12 E:0.071385 |  Just prods it back then towards, closer to Croce.
[2111.60 - 2114.72] P:1835.37 E:0.083860 |  And then the ball goes out and it'll be Marcello who'll play it forward
[2114.72 - 2115.60] P:1906.88 E:0.082210 |  towards Bernard.
[2116.32 - 2118.72] P:1876.09 E:0.085318 |  It's gone completely flat in Belo Horizonte.
[2118.72 - 2120.08] P:1915.14 E:0.086441 |  Bernard then towards Fred.
[2121.20 - 2123.68] P:1961.25 E:0.092288 |  We know that this is a Brazil side with their limitations,
[2123.68 - 2125.52] P:1983.02 E:0.091166 |  as Hulk triggers the offside trap.
[2125.52 - 2126.56] P:1935.70 E:0.080511 |  And that'll be a free kick.
[2127.44 - 2131.92] P:1869.85 E:0.082282 |  And the other thing to remember as well is that this is a Brazilian side,
[2131.92 - 2134.32] P:1837.26 E:0.075803 |  as Mike Ingram has pointed out,
[2134.32 - 2139.36] P:1908.54 E:0.074373 |  that are unbeaten at home since August 2002.
[2139.36 - 2142.72] P:1933.28 E:0.083032 |  Now that was a slightly strange game because they just won the World Cup,
[2142.72 - 2144.72] P:1922.27 E:0.088264 |  playing against Paraguay in August.
[2144.72 - 2149.44] P:1949.54 E:0.076353 |  But since then it is a run of 42 successive home matches,
[2149.44 - 2151.92] P:1890.33 E:0.084679 |  where they are undefeated on Brazilian soil.
[2152.64 - 2158.16] P:1956.49 E:0.076829 |  It's 39 years since they last lost a competitive fixture at home
[2158.16 - 2160.08] P:1867.08 E:0.082431 |  in the semifinal of the Copa America.
[2160.80 - 2162.48] P:1858.18 E:0.093829 |  But to lose in this manner,
[2163.76 - 2165.36] P:1962.15 E:0.099187 |  and there could yet be further goals,
[2166.48 - 2169.04] P:1771.15 E:0.089421 |  well they talk about the Maracanar blow when they lost the final
[2169.04 - 2170.88] P:1846.87 E:0.077521 |  in 1952 Uruguay.
[2170.88 - 2173.84] P:1873.96 E:0.081175 |  This is a hammer blow here in 2014.
[2174.48 - 2176.40] P:1797.24 E:0.087216 |  Out towards LaM on that far side.
[2176.40 - 2179.36] P:1906.53 E:0.080056 |  Germany level with the penalty area.
[2179.36 - 2182.88] P:1897.87 E:0.078663 |  Marcello will not keep the ball in play as he tries to hook it clear
[2182.88 - 2184.16] P:1963.25 E:0.070815 |  to throw to Germany.
[2184.16 - 2186.48] P:1873.77 E:0.078285 |  Well the game's over, simple as that now.
[2187.04 - 2193.12] P:1826.91 E:0.069433 |  Looking around, Brazilian fans clearly do not know what to make of this.
[2193.60 - 2196.64] P:1841.06 E:0.075227 |  It's been, I've never seen a game like it.
[2196.72 - 2202.08] P:1931.06 E:0.078181 |  This magnitude, to be so overwhelmed by the opposition,
[2202.08 - 2203.28] P:1910.84 E:0.080976 |  is absolutely staggering.
[2204.16 - 2207.20] P:1922.59 E:0.078531 |  Here is Germany coming forward once again,
[2207.20 - 2211.28] P:1980.00 E:0.075530 |  trying to thread that ball through towards closer.
[2211.28 - 2214.64] P:1971.76 E:0.094851 |  Only cleared as far as LaM on that far side for Germany.
[2214.64 - 2215.60] P:2061.45 E:0.084656 |  He'll go in field.
[2216.08 - 2217.92] P:1925.91 E:0.079425 |  Crose, who's on a hat-trick.
[2218.48 - 2220.72] P:2036.72 E:0.087018 |  Waits for Nandinho stumbles.
[2220.72 - 2223.20] P:1965.68 E:0.084614 |  The toying with, Germany are toying with Brazil.
[2223.20 - 2225.20] P:2025.57 E:0.089119 |  It's meant to be the semifinal of a World Cup.
[2226.16 - 2230.96] P:1904.61 E:0.078282 |  And 179 seconds between the second and fourth goal.
[2232.56 - 2235.44] P:1870.90 E:0.080941 |  Brazil, they've gone simple as that.
[2235.44 - 2239.20] P:1873.34 E:0.085083 |  Luis Gustavo has just put a crew challenge on Thomas Muller.
[2239.20 - 2241.52] P:1824.37 E:0.080911 |  I think we might start to see a little bit more of that.
[2241.52 - 2244.08] P:1844.92 E:0.080738 |  It's almost too late to try and restore some pride.
[2244.08 - 2248.08] P:1845.22 E:0.080554 |  We talked about before the game that Germany might be the slight favourites.
[2248.08 - 2251.52] P:1883.17 E:0.078254 |  If Brazil were to lose, the pressure's off because Naimeau wasn't there.
[2251.52 - 2254.88] P:1804.95 E:0.081970 |  But we were thinking maybe a 2-1 or a 1-0, something like that.
[2255.52 - 2258.72] P:1831.64 E:0.078283 |  This isn't getting beaten. This is being humiliated.
[2260.24 - 2267.20] P:1908.63 E:0.085321 |  Annihilated as well for a Brazilian side that are reeling here in Belo Horizonte.
[2267.20 - 2270.64] P:1964.25 E:0.084199 |  Five live, your World Cup station for 2014.
[2270.64 - 2273.84] P:1921.46 E:0.078357 |  The second semi to come tomorrow, the final on Sunday.
[2273.84 - 2278.96] P:1901.12 E:0.079466 |  We already know that Germany will be there as the ball is clipped over the top
[2278.96 - 2283.04] P:1957.34 E:0.078502 |  and that will go out of play from Erzal for a goal kick to Brazil.
[2283.68 - 2286.16] P:1910.65 E:0.086836 |  And we've still got seven minutes to go to halftime.
[2286.16 - 2290.32] P:1901.09 E:0.081958 |  I'd like to hear the reaction from the Brazilian supporters at halftime.
[2290.88 - 2293.28] P:1943.15 E:0.098670 |  Just remove the left headphone.
[2293.28 - 2295.12] P:1844.65 E:0.080212 |  I'll tell you what it'll be. It'll be booze.
[2295.12 - 2298.32] P:1824.80 E:0.085189 |  Simple as that for every single Brazilian player.
[2298.32 - 2300.88] P:1749.56 E:0.087205 |  Bizarre. They started the game on the front foot.
[2300.88 - 2304.24] P:1805.64 E:0.079082 |  It was a little bit gun-ho, a little bit frantic in their play,
[2304.24 - 2305.92] P:1743.01 E:0.077191 |  but they started to have a bit of a go.
[2305.92 - 2308.96] P:1776.14 E:0.082390 |  But then once Germany got a little bit of a foothold in the game,
[2310.08 - 2311.84] P:1819.77 E:0.087988 |  overcame that pressure, if you like.
[2312.80 - 2314.24] P:1876.50 E:0.089506 |  So clinical going forward.
[2314.24 - 2316.24] P:1867.10 E:0.071753 |  Superb on the counterattack.
[2317.60 - 2323.76] P:1861.05 E:0.076693 |  And it really is very, very difficult to try and explain how good the Germans have been.
[2323.76 - 2327.20] P:1877.51 E:0.081005 |  Schweinsteiger just epitomises everything about the Germans.
[2327.20 - 2330.48] P:1827.35 E:0.078008 |  He's just sat there, controlled the game, hardly giving the ball away.
[2330.48 - 2331.76] P:1829.89 E:0.085679 |  Absolutely superb.
[2331.76 - 2333.92] P:1870.67 E:0.065185 |  And also how bad the Brazilians have been.
[2333.92 - 2337.12] P:1912.48 E:0.089101 |  Well, defensively, it's been an absolute nightmare for them.
[2337.12 - 2338.72] P:1833.12 E:0.091300 |  They've been all over the shop. David Louise,
[2339.44 - 2340.48] P:1817.81 E:0.080364 |  I think there was a clip beforehand.
[2340.48 - 2342.64] P:1769.94 E:0.075763 |  I said, you know, often plays centre-back forward.
[2342.64 - 2345.04] P:1854.83 E:0.079370 |  You know, he goes on these mazes, he runs. That's brilliant.
[2345.04 - 2349.76] P:1856.03 E:0.082541 |  That, he gets away with it when Tiago Silva is that rock beside him.
[2349.76 - 2351.28] P:1767.39 E:0.081128 |  Dante's not good enough to do that role.
[2351.28 - 2355.36] P:1792.33 E:0.078571 |  He's relatively inexperienced and he's only got 12 caps before today.
[2356.32 - 2359.28] P:1833.32 E:0.076465 |  At the back, you know, Mykon is okay.
[2359.28 - 2362.00] P:1872.59 E:0.087150 |  Marcelo was bombing down the left-hand side,
[2362.00 - 2364.72] P:1866.24 E:0.083180 |  but leaving himself very, very exposed.
[2364.72 - 2367.84] P:1858.20 E:0.082246 |  And the Germans just have that control, that self-belief.
[2367.92 - 2369.44] P:1749.75 E:0.083433 |  Give us the ball, you know what?
[2369.44 - 2372.08] P:1808.25 E:0.076453 |  And we will control the game and eventually we will score.
[2372.08 - 2374.32] P:1853.50 E:0.064325 |  And they scored five in such a short space of time.
[2374.32 - 2376.72] P:1807.16 E:0.080433 |  If we were in Spain now, they'd have the white hankies out.
[2377.60 - 2382.08] P:1938.54 E:0.081290 |  The only white things that are being waved at the minute
[2382.08 - 2385.84] P:1951.85 E:0.089544 |  are the German fans celebrating high up on that right-hand side.
[2385.84 - 2387.44] P:2025.19 E:0.091494 |  Whether it's the shirts that they've taken off,
[2387.44 - 2388.96] P:1910.62 E:0.088868 |  or they've been swung around their heads.
[2389.92 - 2392.00] P:1875.24 E:0.100413 |  Mike, I know you've got a programme coming up, haven't you?
[2392.00 - 2394.16] P:1959.81 E:0.087504 |  Where you're looking back at eight-world tournaments
[2394.16 - 2395.92] P:1949.00 E:0.090537 |  on Friday at nine and Sunday at one.
[2396.88 - 2398.72] P:1981.69 E:0.076648 |  You've covered eight tournaments.
[2398.72 - 2400.40] P:2072.84 E:0.091691 |  Well, this is your eighth World Cup.
[2400.40 - 2401.68] P:2024.52 E:0.065886 |  What are your thoughts at this stage?
[2401.68 - 2404.64] P:1968.63 E:0.099435 |  Well, the only thing that I can think of that's comparable
[2404.64 - 2407.04] P:1929.57 E:0.076892 |  in the first half of a World Cup game,
[2407.04 - 2409.12] P:1906.97 E:0.081094 |  and I'm just watching Germany come forward again.
[2410.88 - 2413.44] P:2006.70 E:0.094056 |  The only thing I can think of that shocked me to the extent
[2413.44 - 2416.56] P:1895.98 E:0.096517 |  that tonight has was when North Korea went into a 4-0 lead
[2416.56 - 2420.32] P:1941.95 E:0.089900 |  against Portugal in the quarter-final in England in 1966.
[2420.32 - 2422.32] P:1936.00 E:0.096309 |  But then, of course, Portugal had Eusebio.
[2422.88 - 2427.60] P:1883.79 E:0.089719 |  And at 3-0 they went up, and then Eusebio came back to score four.
[2429.52 - 2432.40] P:1911.83 E:0.097932 |  And Portugal went through, but in all the World Cups I've covered,
[2432.40 - 2434.16] P:1924.35 E:0.086640 |  no, nothing like this in the first half.
[2434.16 - 2435.60] P:1923.95 E:0.086760 |  This is absolutely unprecedented.
[2436.40 - 2438.96] P:1938.24 E:0.100422 |  Marcelo over towards Bernard on that far side,
[2439.52 - 2442.00] P:1992.37 E:0.097244 |  stopped by Germany, who are leading 5-0.
[2442.72 - 2445.04] P:1963.57 E:0.090292 |  Muller with the first, closer with the second.
[2446.32 - 2448.48] P:1953.17 E:0.097150 |  He has now broken Ronaldo's record.
[2448.48 - 2450.48] P:1956.35 E:0.089656 |  He's the all-time leading scorer in the World Cup.
[2450.56 - 2452.64] P:1983.37 E:0.078796 |  This Hulk tries to chip a ball through.
[2453.20 - 2456.24] P:1962.52 E:0.081073 |  Croce has got two, and Kadeera strokes in the fifth.
[2456.24 - 2458.48] P:1939.43 E:0.078343 |  This worth reiterating that program,
[2458.48 - 2461.20] P:1935.12 E:0.070608 |  as Mike reflects on his World Cup years.
[2461.20 - 2464.64] P:1897.26 E:0.075298 |  Friday at 9 o'clock, and Sunday at 1,
[2464.64 - 2466.56] P:1911.81 E:0.087394 |  the final, of course, in American art,
[2466.56 - 2470.16] P:1943.17 E:0.075011 |  and tomorrow Argentina against Holland from 9 o'clock.
[2470.16 - 2471.76] P:2085.49 E:0.102658 |  Just to get that straight again, it was 3-0,
[2471.76 - 2473.60] P:1964.78 E:0.084250 |  I think North Korea went up, but it was dramatic.
[2474.64 - 2476.72] P:2009.68 E:0.099181 |  Brazil looking for a consolation.
[2476.72 - 2478.40] P:2032.97 E:0.094870 |  Oscar with a shot charged down.
[2478.40 - 2480.48] P:1962.85 E:0.088713 |  Cannons away over towards that far side.
[2482.64 - 2484.24] P:2057.50 E:0.099323 |  People are numb inside this stadium.
[2484.24 - 2486.08] P:1976.93 E:0.077189 |  I think even the Neutrals are too,
[2486.08 - 2489.12] P:1951.60 E:0.079162 |  because nobody, nobody expected this.
[2489.12 - 2489.92] P:1887.20 E:0.082121 |  It's incredible.
[2489.92 - 2493.20] P:1890.93 E:0.074481 |  To put it into perspective, England beat Moldova 5-0.
[2493.92 - 2496.24] P:1976.00 E:0.092547 |  You know, this is Germany beating Brazil.
[2497.52 - 2500.80] P:1821.17 E:0.088278 |  In Brazil, 5-0 within half an hour of the game.
[2501.76 - 2502.64] P:1883.20 E:0.090853 |  I just really...
[2504.40 - 2507.84] P:1972.05 E:0.095881 |  It is, you're right, it is, everybody is almost numb.
[2508.48 - 2509.36] P:1822.39 E:0.094231 |  You know, with sort of like...
[2510.48 - 2511.52] P:1870.03 E:0.087951 |  Is this surreal?
[2511.52 - 2512.56] P:1977.03 E:0.088083 |  You know, is this a dream?
[2512.56 - 2513.36] P:1804.05 E:0.084310 |  Is this a nightmare?
[2513.36 - 2516.24] P:1907.99 E:0.067731 |  It was a complete nightmare for the Brazilians.
[2516.24 - 2517.84] P:1834.28 E:0.076417 |  But they've just been ripped apart.
[2517.84 - 2518.64] P:1774.42 E:0.080043 |  It can't go on enough.
[2518.64 - 2520.08] P:1930.52 E:0.074515 |  Defensively awful.
[2520.08 - 2522.72] P:1978.08 E:0.078934 |  Started with David Luiz, lost concentration,
[2522.72 - 2523.52] P:1900.60 E:0.090002 |  all that passion.
[2524.64 - 2526.08] P:1913.09 E:0.096501 |  You know, got himself a little bit heads up,
[2526.08 - 2527.36] P:1885.10 E:0.079946 |  a little bit worked up,
[2527.36 - 2530.16] P:1879.65 E:0.074940 |  looking at the ball, took his eye off Muller,
[2530.16 - 2530.80] P:1847.36 E:0.066363 |  and that was it.
[2530.80 - 2532.48] P:1932.02 E:0.081858 |  Once that first goal went in,
[2532.48 - 2534.80] P:1897.90 E:0.083241 |  you just saw the Germans growing confidence,
[2534.80 - 2535.76] P:1728.98 E:0.080556 |  growing belief.
[2536.56 - 2539.20] P:1856.49 E:0.071469 |  And they've just ripped this Brazilian team apart.
[2539.20 - 2541.68] P:1887.99 E:0.065470 |  And now it's a training round exercise.
[2541.68 - 2545.44] P:1947.34 E:0.076555 |  The other thing to say, Danny, is if they concede again,
[2545.44 - 2547.68] P:1980.04 E:0.069045 |  it will equal their record defeat,
[2547.68 - 2550.88] P:1962.87 E:0.082248 |  which was against Uruguay in the South American Championships
[2550.88 - 2553.84] P:1902.52 E:0.068069 |  back in September of 1920.
[2553.84 - 2555.20] P:1945.19 E:0.102347 |  Brazil don't lose at home.
[2556.08 - 2557.84] P:1981.52 E:0.097394 |  They certainly don't lose in this manner.
[2558.72 - 2561.52] P:1920.02 E:0.077532 |  Well, if they don't concede again, I will be flabbergasted.
[2561.52 - 2562.64] P:1906.55 E:0.082148 |  I think if they don't concede again,
[2562.64 - 2564.00] P:1903.00 E:0.091087 |  it'll be just as much a surprise
[2564.64 - 2566.56] P:1903.78 E:0.085162 |  as they are being 5-0 down now.
[2566.56 - 2567.92] P:2005.46 E:0.081091 |  Well, a lot will depend, I suppose,
[2567.92 - 2571.04] P:1957.79 E:0.075960 |  on how Germany then approach the second half, won't it?
[2571.04 - 2574.00] P:1888.42 E:0.070330 |  But even still Germany, even if it's played at walking pace,
[2574.64 - 2576.16] P:1917.49 E:0.085668 |  they will create one or two chances.
[2576.16 - 2577.20] P:1874.39 E:0.080741 |  And have we seen so far?
[2577.76 - 2579.28] P:1939.20 E:0.079076 |  They don't need many chances.
[2579.28 - 2581.04] P:1856.70 E:0.086022 |  They probably had six or seven chances.
[2581.04 - 2582.00] P:1776.49 E:0.082028 |  They've scored five goals.
[2582.96 - 2584.72] P:1993.07 E:0.089499 |  Brazil are at walking pace,
[2584.72 - 2585.76] P:2126.68 E:0.094408 |  and here is Hulk.
[2586.32 - 2588.72] P:2014.79 E:0.089983 |  Hulk goes past a couple of half-hearted challenges.
[2589.52 - 2591.04] P:2106.42 E:0.105594 |  Fernandinho slides in.
[2592.24 - 2593.68] P:2068.48 E:0.110291 |  Two minutes to go to halftime.
[2594.40 - 2596.64] P:1936.12 E:0.084137 |  This will be one of the longest nights
[2596.64 - 2598.48] P:1984.53 E:0.088656 |  in the history of Brazilian football,
[2599.36 - 2602.64] P:1978.22 E:0.086954 |  because every minute is going to seem like an hour,
[2602.64 - 2605.36] P:2042.11 E:0.094653 |  trailing 5-0 in the semifinal
[2606.16 - 2608.72] P:1991.09 E:0.088949 |  as a host nation against Germany,
[2609.36 - 2611.76] P:2001.86 E:0.084113 |  and totally and utterly humiliated.
[2613.76 - 2615.68] P:2047.11 E:0.111005 |  90 seconds remain of normal time.
[2619.76 - 2621.68] P:1882.32 E:0.105224 |  It's flat, hardly surprising.
[2621.76 - 2624.16] P:1805.29 E:0.087484 |  I wonder how long those Brazilian players
[2624.16 - 2625.92] P:1732.86 E:0.079091 |  will remain in the dressing room after the game.
[2627.20 - 2628.40] P:1854.98 E:0.090809 |  It could be a couple of hours,
[2628.40 - 2630.48] P:1848.95 E:0.079865 |  because I think when this bus leaves,
[2630.48 - 2633.84] P:1863.22 E:0.087304 |  we saw the amount of people clapping the bus as it came in.
[2634.40 - 2635.76] P:1876.41 E:0.088883 |  That ain't going to be up in on the way out.
[2635.76 - 2639.12] P:2053.58 E:0.090458 |  Marcelo with the free kick flags up on this near-hand side.
[2640.32 - 2641.84] P:2091.49 E:0.112640 |  Well, the Germans are celebrating.
[2642.48 - 2645.12] P:1954.81 E:0.103643 |  There are 12,000 bars, do you know, in Belo Horizonte.
[2645.68 - 2648.00] P:2000.02 E:0.087175 |  They won't be filled tonight with Brazilians.
[2648.08 - 2648.88] P:2005.60 E:0.097258 |  There might be the...
[2650.32 - 2652.24] P:2012.17 E:0.108184 |  I don't know, two, three thousand Germans
[2652.24 - 2654.72] P:2104.56 E:0.098492 |  who are inside this stadium here in Belo Horizonte.
[2654.72 - 2657.12] P:2023.92 E:0.090032 |  In fact, I would imagine that most of those 12,000 bars
[2657.12 - 2658.24] P:2051.48 E:0.085268 |  would have closed early.
[2658.24 - 2659.12] P:2140.56 E:0.095497 |  The shutters will be up.
[2660.16 - 2662.00] P:1897.93 E:0.101371 |  And they might not want to open up those shutters,
[2662.00 - 2664.56] P:1979.78 E:0.092735 |  just like they might not want to open up the curtains tomorrow morning.
[2665.52 - 2667.52] P:2095.59 E:0.104098 |  Such further that we've seen in Brazil,
[2668.16 - 2669.20] P:1975.44 E:0.097923 |  football mad nation,
[2670.88 - 2673.60] P:2027.06 E:0.105265 |  where football is at the very soul of this country,
[2674.16 - 2677.52] P:1953.93 E:0.086839 |  but they will be hurting like no other tonight.
[2678.56 - 2681.68] P:1951.59 E:0.103402 |  We're about to see how much added on time at halftime,
[2682.64 - 2686.80] P:2048.61 E:0.094892 |  but a Brazilian team that are on their knees.
[2687.60 - 2689.44] P:1931.96 E:0.097283 |  What does Big Field do at halftime now?
[2690.24 - 2691.92] P:1962.77 E:0.096210 |  It can't change it really and say,
[2691.92 - 2694.72] P:1901.87 E:0.086771 |  well, let's go for it because they did that and they've been ripped apart.
[2695.92 - 2698.72] P:2023.93 E:0.099608 |  Marcelo coming forward, away from Fred.
[2700.24 - 2701.20] P:1955.83 E:0.108973 |  And Noy will be there.
[2701.20 - 2702.40] P:2010.22 E:0.103717 |  And Noy just plays it early.
[2702.40 - 2704.40] P:1834.00 E:0.093361 |  One minute of added on time, which we're now into.
[2704.40 - 2706.48] P:1904.21 E:0.083565 |  But if the players don't have a go,
[2706.48 - 2708.72] P:1965.93 E:0.091289 |  they'll be accused of being no pride in it.
[2710.00 - 2714.64] P:1852.47 E:0.085034 |  I think it's now almost an impossible team talk for Scolari.
[2715.44 - 2718.56] P:1937.30 E:0.081234 |  Whatever he does, whatever he says to these players,
[2718.56 - 2720.80] P:1836.53 E:0.087195 |  they've got to come out and play some pride in the second half.
[2721.68 - 2724.08] P:1813.77 E:0.080316 |  But it almost has to accept defeat and just say,
[2724.08 - 2725.20] P:1887.87 E:0.083417 |  look, the game's over, lads.
[2725.20 - 2725.76] P:1961.00 E:0.080986 |  You've lost it.
[2725.76 - 2730.56] P:1904.01 E:0.073207 |  You've blown your chance of becoming absolute legends in this country.
[2730.56 - 2732.88] P:1821.40 E:0.082828 |  The only you not going to become legends,
[2733.76 - 2736.08] P:1789.83 E:0.090188 |  you are going to become villains for the rest of your lives.
[2736.72 - 2738.40] P:1867.70 E:0.094077 |  The headline will be written.
[2738.40 - 2741.36] P:2021.86 E:0.093324 |  However, the script to the story is still not finished yet
[2742.64 - 2745.60] P:2015.19 E:0.093316 |  because it could get a lot, lot worse for Brazil.
[2745.60 - 2746.96] P:2007.53 E:0.085576 |  Training 5-0.
[2746.96 - 2750.80] P:2065.70 E:0.092200 |  You might be able to hear the strains of the German fans already celebrating.
[2750.80 - 2752.16] P:2042.45 E:0.079597 |  Ball from Louise.
[2752.16 - 2754.72] P:2012.45 E:0.083611 |  Hulk will not keep that ball in play.
[2754.72 - 2755.84] P:2044.27 E:0.092036 |  That will be a goal kick.
[2758.40 - 2759.84] P:1981.31 E:0.106376 |  Thiago Silva and Neymar.
[2759.84 - 2761.76] P:1893.14 E:0.078920 |  I wonder what they're feeling right now.
[2761.76 - 2763.52] P:1874.39 E:0.083084 |  Disappointed not to be playing.
[2763.52 - 2765.84] P:1797.62 E:0.094727 |  But I tell you what, they'll be part of them thinking, you know what.
[2766.56 - 2768.32] P:1883.06 E:0.090550 |  I am so glad I am not out there.
[2769.44 - 2773.52] P:2052.46 E:0.108903 |  Booth and Gears hardly surprising from the Brazilian fans
[2774.32 - 2776.24] P:2020.39 E:0.102435 |  to greet the half-time whistle,
[2777.20 - 2780.64] P:2109.83 E:0.097822 |  which is an incredible scoreline in Belo Horizonte.
[2780.64 - 2783.28] P:2103.05 E:0.089487 |  A Brazil-0, Germany 5.
[2783.92 - 2786.24] P:1997.07 E:0.087755 |  Brazil shrug off the field.
[2787.12 - 2788.56] P:2123.35 E:0.104706 |  High fives for the Germans.
[2789.84 - 2793.36] P:2069.57 E:0.093468 |  But this is certainly one of those occasions to say I was there, Janney Mills.
[2793.36 - 2794.08] P:1771.62 E:0.095797 |  Unbelievable.
[2794.16 - 2796.72] P:1790.73 E:0.084850 |  I can see half these Brazilians not coming back for second half.
[2797.36 - 2799.76] P:1779.79 E:0.085237 |  A bit like the team haven't turned up in the first half.
[2799.76 - 2801.28] P:1828.99 E:0.099731 |  I think the fans might just go home.
[2802.40 - 2803.52] P:1842.77 E:0.083775 |  Drown their sorrows.
[2803.52 - 2806.00] P:1902.52 E:0.098200 |  You know, we're seeing now, it's been pictured on the monitors in front of us.
[2807.04 - 2808.88] P:1777.26 E:0.089691 |  People in floods of tears.
[2808.88 - 2810.48] P:1696.35 E:0.085899 |  This will hurt them more.
[2810.48 - 2811.36] P:1846.86 E:0.087409 |  Anything else.
[2812.40 - 2813.12] P:1867.59 E:0.081035 |  Ah, it's just...
[2814.32 - 2816.40] P:1709.19 E:0.099955 |  It really is unbelievable.
[2816.40 - 2816.96] P:1970.48 E:0.093268 |  Speechless.
[2817.76 - 2819.60] P:1880.00 E:0.089208 |  We never saw anything like this coming.
[2819.60 - 2821.92] P:1853.51 E:0.088767 |  You wouldn't expect this in a group game, would you, Mark?
[2822.56 - 2827.12] P:1762.10 E:0.090718 |  It's our job to talk out loud, as we're reminded all the time,
[2827.12 - 2829.52] P:1806.24 E:0.082120 |  but it's hard to know what to say.
[2829.52 - 2834.00] P:1889.61 E:0.084911 |  It is quite the most extraordinary sporting thing I think any of us have ever seen.
[2834.64 - 2836.96] P:1819.13 E:0.093812 |  Five-wheel down at half-time.
[2836.96 - 2841.04] P:1930.52 E:0.080917 |  Chris Waddle the other day said this is the worst Brazilian side he's ever seen.
[2841.04 - 2845.04] P:1842.23 E:0.074185 |  But I bet you even Chris wouldn't have thought of this scoreline.
[2845.52 - 2846.48] P:1959.02 E:0.096669 |  I mean, it is.
[2847.12 - 2849.84] P:1967.06 E:0.091889 |  You're having to pull your jaw off the floor.
[2849.84 - 2852.08] P:1948.76 E:0.089382 |  We talked about, didn't we, that they might get beaten.
[2852.08 - 2855.52] P:1978.00 E:0.088301 |  It might be 2-1, it might be 3-1 at worst, maybe.
[2855.52 - 2859.28] P:1982.16 E:0.090427 |  There'll be the excuse that Neymar wasn't there, Tiago Silva wasn't there.
[2859.28 - 2861.92] P:1871.81 E:0.083543 |  And we thought, well, okay, you can see this going either way.
[2861.92 - 2865.12] P:1902.60 E:0.084023 |  Germans we know are very, very good and cool and calm and collected.
[2865.12 - 2866.40] P:1869.07 E:0.078781 |  Lots of passion from the Brazilians.
[2866.40 - 2868.40] P:1910.98 E:0.082585 |  We saw that in the first 10, 15 minutes.
[2869.68 - 2872.56] P:1699.77 E:0.094469 |  And then five-nil down in a World Cup semi-final.
[2873.36 - 2875.68] P:1881.33 E:0.083686 |  Just absolutely staggering.
[2875.68 - 2879.52] P:1929.11 E:0.101232 |  The last team to score five in a World Cup semi-final were Brazil, ironically.
[2879.60 - 2880.96] P:2130.82 E:0.080683 |  In 1958.
[2880.96 - 2883.20] P:2114.86 E:0.097542 |  And I think as you've mentioned here, they're going to lose
[2883.20 - 2888.64] P:1908.95 E:0.084692 |  in a competitive match at home for the first time since 1975 when Peru beat them.
[2888.64 - 2893.52] P:1997.21 E:0.089342 |  But to be beaten in this match, to be absolutely humiliated in this manner.
[2894.56 - 2897.12] P:1886.37 E:0.098929 |  Mike Higgin, what are your thoughts before we bring in Julio Gomez,
[2897.12 - 2899.36] P:1801.15 E:0.084150 |  who's very bravely come back to speak to us?
[2899.36 - 2900.64] P:1910.72 E:0.072904 |  Mike, what are your thoughts?
[2900.64 - 2903.84] P:2010.97 E:0.093649 |  Well, I'm trying to put it into a World Cup context,
[2903.84 - 2907.28] P:1868.30 E:0.080722 |  but actually, Mark, I'm putting it into a football context.
[2907.28 - 2909.60] P:1850.51 E:0.080768 |  I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like this before.
[2909.60 - 2910.48] P:1832.51 E:0.085222 |  Not even in the Premier...
[2910.48 - 2913.68] P:1985.03 E:0.086447 |  I remember Manchester United running right one day against Arsenal,
[2913.68 - 2915.84] P:1931.99 E:0.088345 |  and Arsenal are sitting just behind us, by the way.
[2915.84 - 2917.04] P:1865.44 E:0.074645 |  I think they were five-nil.
[2917.04 - 2919.36] P:1826.36 E:0.075524 |  But this is the semi-final of the World Cup.
[2919.36 - 2925.52] P:1934.34 E:0.081694 |  And the only thing I can think of that had the same effect on me as a teenager,
[2925.52 - 2928.40] P:1894.63 E:0.080411 |  really, was watching that North Korean team at Goodison Park
[2928.40 - 2929.60] P:1912.56 E:0.091269 |  go into a three-nil lead.
[2929.60 - 2931.28] P:1925.63 E:0.082570 |  And then, of course, Eusebio just said,
[2931.28 - 2933.04] P:1813.83 E:0.084226 |  I'm not having this and took over.
[2933.12 - 2938.00] P:1855.55 E:0.079776 |  But there's been all this talk about Pele in 1962,
[2938.00 - 2942.80] P:1936.50 E:0.084387 |  with Neymar being injured, and of course Pele was injured in 1962.
[2942.80 - 2944.48] P:1920.83 E:0.097157 |  Brazil still went on to win the World Cup.
[2944.48 - 2945.84] P:1888.00 E:0.086955 |  But of course, that Brazilian team
[2945.84 - 2950.48] P:1944.21 E:0.085557 |  had got the likes of Garencha, Zagalo, Dede and Vava,
[2950.48 - 2952.24] P:1925.22 E:0.081491 |  as well as Amarillo, who came in.
[2952.24 - 2953.28] P:1792.57 E:0.078667 |  So it's not comparable.
[2954.16 - 2957.20] P:1935.56 E:0.103791 |  Brazilian lady, we just saw the monitor, is on the phone,
[2957.20 - 2959.68] P:1896.93 E:0.081101 |  and she's in absolute floods of tears.
[2959.68 - 2961.04] P:1747.17 E:0.089789 |  Julia, thank you for coming back.
[2962.00 - 2962.88] P:1812.21 E:0.100251 |  Speak if you can.
[2964.56 - 2967.44] P:1693.45 E:0.090870 |  Look, this is a shocking moment.
[2967.44 - 2973.44] P:1631.38 E:0.084209 |  And I think, and I'm very, I'm almost alone in this thought here in Brazil.
[2973.44 - 2975.20] P:1514.64 E:0.088068 |  Brazilian football needs it.
[2975.92 - 2978.08] P:1715.67 E:0.085236 |  Brazilian football needs this.
[2979.28 - 2981.36] P:1791.08 E:0.088749 |  Humiliation at home.
[2981.36 - 2983.52] P:1840.95 E:0.078611 |  So we change everything.
[2983.52 - 2988.72] P:1646.89 E:0.081616 |  Everything is being done wrong in this country when it comes to football.
[2988.72 - 2994.64] P:1746.40 E:0.077891 |  Youth football, local league, the way players behave,
[2994.64 - 3002.80] P:1702.44 E:0.081870 |  the way players are trained, the way coaches don't go abroad to take information,
[3003.68 - 3006.32] P:1785.86 E:0.084575 |  exchange information and all that.
[3006.32 - 3012.00] P:1690.14 E:0.083374 |  We sit in five titles and always thought it would sort out our problems.
[3012.64 - 3016.32] P:1648.70 E:0.084951 |  When, if a British man comes, not to me,
[3016.32 - 3020.32] P:1661.77 E:0.092113 |  but to a Brazilian friend saying, oh, you should be doing this, this and that,
[3021.36 - 3025.20] P:1328.82 E:0.087022 |  a Brazilian would reply, well, I've got five stars in my jersey,
[3025.20 - 3028.00] P:1576.10 E:0.075956 |  and you've got one end of discussion.
[3028.00 - 3029.84] P:1442.06 E:0.099065 |  This is not how it goes.
[3029.84 - 3033.84] P:1671.71 E:0.083308 |  Football evolved, and Brazilian football needs to evolve.
[3034.56 - 3041.12] P:1680.10 E:0.081565 |  The only thing I really hope is that this humiliation changes things here in Brazil.
[3041.12 - 3045.84] P:1722.41 E:0.080280 |  I don't know if it's going to happen, but I truly hope it does.
[3046.40 - 3050.48] P:1788.23 E:0.088799 |  Everything you've just said about Brazilian football is what we say about English football.
[3050.48 - 3051.52] P:1779.66 E:0.074308 |  You realise that?
[3051.52 - 3054.56] P:1884.79 E:0.093577 |  The way the players are coached, they've got five, you've got to say.
[3054.56 - 3056.24] P:1815.42 E:0.072099 |  At least in the semi-final.
[3056.24 - 3057.04] P:1728.25 E:0.091349 |  Yeah, yeah.
[3057.04 - 3059.04] P:1963.61 E:0.081461 |  We only made it two games in.
[3059.04 - 3061.36] P:1645.07 E:0.095805 |  We have the players.
[3061.36 - 3065.04] P:1688.98 E:0.084510 |  We have too many people, we have 200 million people in a country.
[3065.68 - 3070.40] P:1820.81 E:0.081231 |  The only thing people do when the kids play ball.
[3070.40 - 3072.80] P:1636.10 E:0.088522 |  So obviously, you always have good players,
[3072.80 - 3074.16] P:1511.23 E:0.088068 |  and they will always go to...
[3074.16 - 3075.28] P:1162.49 E:0.079395 |  This is the European team.
[3076.16 - 3077.44] P:1639.61 E:0.076542 |  This is Brazil, Europe.
[3077.44 - 3078.88] P:1476.66 E:0.089027 |  I mean, they all play there.
[3078.88 - 3083.20] P:1404.95 E:0.081755 |  They all learned how to play football there.
[3083.20 - 3086.00] P:1555.09 E:0.079821 |  You see, it has nothing to do with Brazilian football.
[3086.80 - 3089.44] P:1618.22 E:0.084701 |  So we have to change things here in this country.
[3091.36 - 3094.72] P:1655.68 E:0.094129 |  If we don't, yeah, we're still going to win one World Cup here,
[3094.72 - 3098.48] P:1489.61 E:0.082912 |  one semi-final here and there, because obviously the players are good.
[3098.48 - 3103.76] P:1731.40 E:0.075373 |  But I hope this shocking moment will change things here in the country.
[3103.84 - 3106.16] P:1726.12 E:0.084079 |  Let me just ask you one very, very briefly.
[3106.16 - 3107.68] P:1849.39 E:0.084416 |  This is a serious question.
[3107.68 - 3109.52] P:1908.66 E:0.088368 |  Do you expect trouble here tonight?
[3109.52 - 3110.64] P:1793.84 E:0.056624 |  No, I don't.
[3110.64 - 3111.28] P:1692.05 E:0.050009 |  No.
[3111.28 - 3113.04] P:1671.01 E:0.072017 |  No, I just don't.
[3113.04 - 3114.88] P:1719.99 E:0.073471 |  I expect tears.
[3114.88 - 3116.40] P:1833.74 E:0.098520 |  Well, there are plenty of them already.
[3118.16 - 3121.04] P:1855.15 E:0.097325 |  Just Mark Chapman, let me read you this tweet, which is quite funny.
[3121.04 - 3124.32] P:1914.37 E:0.097408 |  Alfonso says, well, at least when any team gets a drumming this season,
[3124.32 - 3127.52] P:1837.49 E:0.089327 |  the fans could truthfully sing, it's just like watching Brazil.
[3129.12 - 3132.48] P:1665.56 E:0.096180 |  Well, let me via Amy Lawrence read one back to you.
[3132.48 - 3136.32] P:1598.27 E:0.087169 |  Mark, you mentioned not having seen anything like it, maybe,
[3136.32 - 3138.64] P:1654.65 E:0.091133 |  not even in the Premier League, but Amy.
[3138.64 - 3141.36] P:1606.28 E:0.093287 |  Yeah, there's a tweet here from Red Action Gunners,
[3141.36 - 3144.40] P:1522.71 E:0.085049 |  who found a tweet from earlier on in the tournament saying,
[3144.40 - 3148.48] P:1493.31 E:0.096962 |  this is like watching Arsenal in the 12.45am kick-off.
[3148.48 - 3151.44] P:1831.29 E:0.104538 |  I saw that as well, and I did think it was quite similar.
[3151.44 - 3154.00] P:1806.30 E:0.094668 |  It was like watching Arsenal at Stanford Bridge or at Abfield.
[3154.72 - 3157.84] P:1572.50 E:0.093035 |  That will be back with Mark and the team there shortly.
[3157.84 - 3161.12] P:1759.43 E:0.082563 |  Amy and Tim Vickery and Rafael Honigstein
[3161.20 - 3164.96] P:1936.94 E:0.087169 |  are in the studio here in Rio with us this evening.
[3164.96 - 3171.04] P:1687.50 E:0.090494 |  A Rafael Honigstein who couldn't relax, maybe, until it was 4-0.
[3171.04 - 3173.20] P:1695.69 E:0.101679 |  And he's sat now, watching the replays.
[3173.20 - 3174.40] P:1679.20 E:0.092773 |  You're not going to get any sense out of it.
[3174.40 - 3175.36] P:1951.96 E:0.112478 |  He's just watching the goals.
[3175.36 - 3179.84] P:1793.23 E:0.088857 |  He's watching the replays on the monitor that we have in the studio.
[3179.84 - 3181.76] P:1774.33 E:0.090115 |  Can you talk in amongst the grinning?
[3183.28 - 3183.92] P:1570.76 E:0.115776 |  I'll try.
[3183.92 - 3188.88] P:1674.85 E:0.093113 |  It's just so hard to relate to a game which turned
[3189.60 - 3191.68] P:1529.88 E:0.080229 |  on one or two minutes.
[3191.68 - 3194.96] P:1477.38 E:0.081792 |  I thought Germany started badly for Brazil were up for it.
[3194.96 - 3197.28] P:1776.53 E:0.078677 |  They looked sharp. They pressed.
[3197.28 - 3198.40] P:1677.82 E:0.075590 |  Germany couldn't keep the ball.
[3198.40 - 3200.80] P:1421.67 E:0.094823 |  I think Mesut Uzil, the first four balls that went to him,
[3200.80 - 3202.24] P:1833.71 E:0.085284 |  he lost all of them.
[3202.24 - 3203.92] P:1477.83 E:0.080765 |  There was no rhythm, nothing.
[3203.92 - 3206.64] P:1620.17 E:0.087261 |  Then there was this key challenge, you remember, from Filipe Blanc?
[3206.64 - 3207.76] P:1815.11 E:0.046845 |  Yeah. Yes.
[3207.76 - 3209.12] P:1907.19 E:0.096136 |  Which, very rightly, was given as a...
[3209.12 - 3211.52] P:1548.88 E:0.083482 |  And Marcelo appealed for a penalty, but it was a cracking tackle.
[3211.52 - 3213.20] P:1104.34 E:0.094328 |  As a corner, I think.
[3213.20 - 3216.72] P:1316.28 E:0.085476 |  And from the corner on the other side, Germany scored,
[3216.72 - 3218.40] P:1348.17 E:0.066808 |  and then the game opened up completely.
[3218.88 - 3220.64] P:1153.15 E:0.077710 |  And Brazil collapsed.
[3220.64 - 3223.04] P:1695.85 E:0.087103 |  And I think if ever you needed a demonstration
[3223.04 - 3226.00] P:1485.81 E:0.086706 |  of the importance of psychology, even at this level,
[3226.56 - 3227.60] P:1059.35 E:0.080550 |  this is the game.
[3227.60 - 3231.68] P:1390.18 E:0.089359 |  I think they completely lost themselves on that pitch.
[3231.68 - 3232.32] P:1721.00 E:0.073074 |  Tim Vickery.
[3232.32 - 3236.24] P:1760.90 E:0.076187 |  I think this shows that confidence is never an abstract.
[3236.24 - 3239.68] P:1718.82 E:0.097400 |  Confidence always reflects your own perception of your ability
[3239.68 - 3242.00] P:1629.46 E:0.058856 |  to carry out a certain task.
[3242.00 - 3244.64] P:1723.80 E:0.096546 |  And yes, Brazil, as they did in the Confederations Cup,
[3245.52 - 3248.00] P:1621.29 E:0.077779 |  very quick out of the blocks, full of brio.
[3248.00 - 3252.64] P:1513.52 E:0.081194 |  But the test of a team always, always, always is when you go a goal down.
[3252.64 - 3255.84] P:1498.36 E:0.093308 |  And as soon as they went a goal down, the balloon was pricked.
[3256.64 - 3258.80] P:1452.06 E:0.086591 |  And they absolutely fell apart.
[3258.80 - 3261.04] P:1577.90 E:0.073737 |  The defence was Fred Karno in his army.
[3261.04 - 3263.84] P:1649.48 E:0.096606 |  I can't recall seeing a top international side
[3263.84 - 3266.16] P:1583.94 E:0.080677 |  defend worse than Brazil have done.
[3266.72 - 3271.28] P:1688.66 E:0.081781 |  And I thought Julo Gomez in his comments was absolutely magnificent.
[3271.28 - 3272.48] P:1872.72 E:0.110157 |  That's exactly what you were saying to us.
[3272.48 - 3277.52] P:1761.67 E:0.083469 |  Yes. And as a Brazil fan, I feel very sorry for these players
[3277.52 - 3280.48] P:1777.29 E:0.079015 |  because a humiliation plays really big in this part of the world.
[3280.48 - 3284.00] P:1844.53 E:0.084135 |  And these players will live with this humiliation for the rest of their careers.
[3284.00 - 3286.96] P:1666.25 E:0.075235 |  But look, taking the wide of you on Brazilian football,
[3286.96 - 3289.76] P:1639.87 E:0.071621 |  this could not possibly be better.
[3289.76 - 3292.24] P:1809.03 E:0.098944 |  In order to change, and Brazilian football is operating
[3292.24 - 3295.20] P:1935.56 E:0.079062 |  so far below its potential, it's untrue.
[3295.20 - 3298.96] P:1816.12 E:0.087985 |  In order to change, they need something like this
[3298.96 - 3301.20] P:1777.45 E:0.093314 |  to stop that arrogance of we've won it five times
[3301.20 - 3303.76] P:1424.38 E:0.052308 |  because that was then, this is now.
[3303.84 - 3307.60] P:1691.42 E:0.086921 |  Kerr just talked about what they touched on it in Belo Horizonte.
[3307.60 - 3311.52] P:1726.17 E:0.079016 |  But our studio at the moment looks out over the Copacabana.
[3311.52 - 3313.84] P:1925.35 E:0.084229 |  It has rained since just before kickoff.
[3313.84 - 3316.16] P:1720.97 E:0.090964 |  Myself and Amy put a couple of pictures on social media
[3316.16 - 3317.92] P:1909.72 E:0.082095 |  to be able to see of it lashing down.
[3317.92 - 3320.72] P:1699.50 E:0.080833 |  So there aren't that many people out there on the beach.
[3320.72 - 3324.72] P:1821.41 E:0.082747 |  As I look out of our window, stretches down the Copacabana towards the fan fest,
[3324.72 - 3327.04] P:1830.05 E:0.087960 |  I can see an awful lot of flashing red lights.
[3327.04 - 3328.72] P:1743.36 E:0.074524 |  Probably police vehicles.
[3328.72 - 3331.04] P:1794.82 E:0.085019 |  There might be the odd fire engine in there as well.
[3331.12 - 3334.88] P:1815.03 E:0.088864 |  I have to say, they don't look as numerous as they did on the opening night
[3334.88 - 3339.52] P:1844.53 E:0.087336 |  after Brazil beat Croatia and there were protests outside our TV studio.
[3339.52 - 3344.64] P:1741.91 E:0.065903 |  So at this stage, it's probably impossible to guess
[3344.64 - 3346.08] P:1717.87 E:0.087416 |  what the reaction will be at full time.
[3346.08 - 3349.04] P:1813.60 E:0.094541 |  But it would appear that the police are gearing themselves up
[3349.04 - 3352.72] P:1648.28 E:0.076921 |  to make sure that nothing comes down from the fan fest towards this end.
[3352.72 - 3356.72] P:1617.78 E:0.083763 |  Sure. And the reaction, to be honest, no one can really predict.
[3356.72 - 3359.36] P:1782.88 E:0.088525 |  Because we've never been in this situation before.
[3359.36 - 3364.08] P:1725.15 E:0.077008 |  And as Julius said, he thinks there will be more tears than anything else.
[3364.08 - 3369.12] P:1602.97 E:0.075087 |  I agree. But I also think, certainly, myself, after our transmission,
[3369.12 - 3370.72] P:1458.24 E:0.066857 |  I'm going home. I'm going home.
[3370.72 - 3372.48] P:1350.39 E:0.073296 |  As a foreigner, I'm keeping my head down tonight.
[3373.28 - 3374.80] P:1645.45 E:0.083667 |  Right. And what should we do the same?
[3375.36 - 3376.72] P:1738.92 E:0.089935 |  Yes, please do.
[3376.72 - 3380.48] P:1686.71 E:0.102163 |  Let's get a BBC News update and then we will be back for the second half.
[3380.48 - 3383.04] P:1772.38 E:0.089950 |  Goodness only knows what that is going to bring.
[3383.04 - 3387.12] P:1820.60 E:0.091899 |  As it stands at halftime, Brazil nil, Germany five,
[3387.20 - 3390.40] P:1653.71 E:0.074804 |  in a World Cup semi-final. Here's Alison Hughes.
[3391.92 - 3397.12] P:1395.84 E:0.095193 |  On digital, online, smartphone and tablet, this is BBC Five Live.
[3397.12 - 3400.40] P:1147.94 E:0.097098 |  The most senior civil servant at the Home Office has admitted the department
[3400.40 - 3404.08] P:1560.53 E:0.081751 |  probably destroyed most of its 114 missing files,
[3404.08 - 3407.76] P:1756.98 E:0.082691 |  which could shed some light on historical allegations of child abuse.
[3407.76 - 3411.60] P:1514.38 E:0.078857 |  But Mark Sedwell told the Home Affairs Select Committee
[3411.60 - 3413.76] P:1387.94 E:0.088394 |  there was a record of the names of the files.
[3413.76 - 3415.68] P:1574.79 E:0.077794 |  Keith Vaz as the committee's chairman.
[3415.68 - 3419.76] P:1181.68 E:0.073050 |  I have asked Mr Sedwell to go back and at the very least,
[3419.76 - 3422.48] P:1072.52 E:0.073882 |  look at the list of the titles of the files.
[3422.48 - 3426.08] P:1216.61 E:0.081758 |  So they still retain the names of the files,
[3426.08 - 3428.48] P:950.94 E:0.073494 |  but they don't have the files themselves.
[3428.48 - 3431.76] P:1246.40 E:0.081480 |  So if he could do that, that will just give us an indication
[3431.76 - 3434.72] P:1140.99 E:0.077275 |  of whether or not they're serious and relevant.
[3434.72 - 3436.80] P:1053.28 E:0.083763 |  But this is a very chaotic department.
[3437.60 - 3441.92] P:1564.01 E:0.078833 |  Israel has authorised the military to call up 40,000 reservists
[3441.92 - 3445.20] P:1420.83 E:0.087982 |  and says it isn't ruling out a ground invasion of Gaza.
[3445.20 - 3449.52] P:1411.05 E:0.087744 |  The country's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says Israel is not eager for war,
[3449.52 - 3451.68] P:1548.51 E:0.067955 |  but wants to stop the rocket attacks.
[3451.68 - 3455.04] P:1520.02 E:0.087927 |  Palestinian officials say 15 people have died in Gaza
[3455.04 - 3458.88] P:1431.39 E:0.082890 |  after a day of Israeli air raids. Yolande Nel is in Gaza City.
[3458.88 - 3461.68] P:1211.51 E:0.072131 |  Well, at the moment, the message is very much one of defiance
[3461.68 - 3463.76] P:1357.48 E:0.069785 |  from the militant groups here in Gaza.
[3463.76 - 3469.04] P:1435.01 E:0.070207 |  We heard volleys of rockets being fired off in the direction of Israel,
[3469.04 - 3472.00] P:1338.90 E:0.073204 |  and we're getting lots of claims coming through from militant groups
[3472.00 - 3476.40] P:1701.90 E:0.070371 |  that they're managing to reach areas that they haven't previously been able to reach.
[3477.04 - 3482.08] P:1487.86 E:0.085353 |  The leader of a trek to the Arctic, in which a 17-year-old from Salisbury was killed by a polar bear,
[3482.08 - 3484.72] P:1677.04 E:0.079873 |  says he gouged the bear's eyes during the attack.
[3484.72 - 3488.88] P:1478.78 E:0.082027 |  Michael Reed told an inquest he fought the animal when his rifle failed to fire.
[3490.00 - 3495.28] P:1576.42 E:0.088677 |  Two British men who went to Syria to join rebel fighters have pleaded guilty to terrorism charges.
[3495.28 - 3498.48] P:1313.78 E:0.088275 |  Nahin Ahmed and Yusuf Sawa, both from Birmingham,
[3498.48 - 3501.12] P:1447.17 E:0.075978 |  admitted preparing to carry out terrorist acts.
[3501.12 - 3503.04] P:1657.07 E:0.075671 |  They'll be sentenced in the next few weeks.
[3503.68 - 3506.48] P:1426.98 E:0.097880 |  And the British Chambers of Commerce is warning the Bank of England
[3506.48 - 3509.04] P:1658.88 E:0.074972 |  against a premature rise in interest rates.
[3509.04 - 3513.92] P:1442.66 E:0.075142 |  Manufacturing output fell by 1.3% in May, the first drop in six months.
[3514.80 - 3518.80] P:1414.89 E:0.105063 |  BBC Radio 5 Live, the home of Brazil, 2014.
[3520.56 - 3525.04] P:1710.08 E:0.093506 |  It is the first World Cup semi-final here at Brazil, 2014,
[3525.04 - 3527.84] P:1835.58 E:0.087084 |  between the host nation and Germany.
[3527.84 - 3530.96] P:1838.03 E:0.087912 |  Thomas Muller gave the Germans the lead in the 11th minute,
[3530.96 - 3533.92] P:1803.01 E:0.074291 |  and they're followed five minutes of madness.
[3533.92 - 3536.08] P:1896.77 E:0.102682 |  Tony Kruse has got it, it's gone into the area to Muller,
[3536.08 - 3537.28] P:2033.07 E:0.099959 |  and there's a chance for Closer.
[3537.28 - 3540.00] P:2022.00 E:0.096966 |  Great save from Cesar, but Closer's there!
[3540.00 - 3543.04] P:1921.94 E:0.094577 |  Second time round to break Ronaldo's record.
[3543.04 - 3545.68] P:1901.85 E:0.098974 |  Against all teams, he's done it against Brazil,
[3545.68 - 3548.00] P:1867.32 E:0.084041 |  and is there any way back now for the hosts?
[3548.00 - 3550.40] P:1901.85 E:0.091369 |  Larm is forward on the right-hand side, Muller's missed it.
[3550.40 - 3553.12] P:2055.44 E:0.094235 |  Kruse with a shot, there's the third goal!
[3553.12 - 3557.04] P:1947.87 E:0.085201 |  And in a stadium that he's sulting yellow, a black cloud.
[3557.12 - 3561.52] P:1802.16 E:0.083408 |  Looms large. Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable.
[3561.52 - 3564.64] P:1664.68 E:0.083243 |  Defensive line for Brazil, and absolute shambles.
[3564.64 - 3567.60] P:1616.55 E:0.088902 |  And if you were giving points out of 10 so far,
[3567.60 - 3571.12] P:1652.04 E:0.097100 |  you might give Fernandinho one for putting his shirt on the right way round.
[3571.12 - 3575.36] P:1969.51 E:0.091353 |  Here is Kedira, Kedira back to Kruse, it's the second goal!
[3575.36 - 3579.28] P:1942.15 E:0.104355 |  Brazil are capitulating, and the Germans are romping their way
[3579.28 - 3581.52] P:1498.66 E:0.114090 |  through to the final in the American R.
[3581.52 - 3585.12] P:1767.07 E:0.114562 |  Brazil nil, Germany four, unbelievable.
[3585.20 - 3586.40] P:1725.01 E:0.114562 |  They're in again here, Germany.
[3586.40 - 3589.52] P:1869.97 E:0.119017 |  This is Kedira, he's got options, he's pulled the ball back to Erzl.
[3589.52 - 3593.84] P:1679.31 E:0.115478 |  Here is Kedira again, and Kedira strokes the ball in right footed.
[3593.84 - 3597.28] P:1777.98 E:0.109107 |  Germany are running riots, Brazil nil.
[3597.28 - 3600.80] P:1835.49 E:0.113257 |  Germany five, we haven't even played half an hour.
[3600.80 - 3603.76] P:1500.17 E:0.114753 |  In all the World Cups I've covered, this is absolutely unprecedented.
[3607.76 - 3609.28] P:1490.56 E:0.135856 |  Well, that's what happened in the first half.
[3609.28 - 3613.76] P:1588.53 E:0.103964 |  The teams are out early for the second 45 minutes.
[3614.48 - 3617.44] P:1651.25 E:0.102739 |  I dread to think what the reaction was for the Brazilian players,
[3617.44 - 3619.44] P:1735.30 E:0.080358 |  Mark Pugach, when they came back out.
[3619.44 - 3620.96] P:1759.01 E:0.089271 |  They got booed, Mark, they got booed.
[3620.96 - 3622.56] P:1825.43 E:0.096553 |  Only about six or seven of them came out.
[3622.56 - 3625.20] P:1619.02 E:0.092212 |  There's an old man clasping a replica of the World Cup,
[3625.20 - 3627.44] P:1666.91 E:0.084008 |  and he's about a cap size in tears.
[3627.44 - 3630.80] P:1895.69 E:0.085367 |  There have been several substitutions from both sides, Mike Kingham,
[3630.80 - 3634.24] P:1886.04 E:0.086582 |  after the worst 45 minutes in Brazilian football history.
[3636.40 - 3637.12] P:1930.30 E:0.105988 |  Thank you, Mark.
[3637.12 - 3641.28] P:1927.04 E:0.088355 |  I think I said at the start of the game you could feel the tension of the occasion.
[3641.28 - 3643.36] P:1809.88 E:0.090323 |  Actually, you can't now because it's all over, really,
[3643.44 - 3647.44] P:1844.68 E:0.072339 |  but damage limitation may be for Brazil in the second half.
[3647.44 - 3649.68] P:1872.62 E:0.082469 |  Let me tell you about the changes that Brazil have made.
[3650.32 - 3653.76] P:1835.16 E:0.079550 |  Fernandinho, as suggested by Tim Vickery, really,
[3653.76 - 3655.60] P:1833.19 E:0.079981 |  he's made way for Paulinho.
[3656.16 - 3658.08] P:1855.10 E:0.083942 |  And Enrique has come on for Hult.
[3658.08 - 3662.00] P:1934.49 E:0.075542 |  We'll just wait and see exactly how he's going to play, where he'll play.
[3662.00 - 3664.40] P:1892.92 E:0.081903 |  I'll give you the revised Brazilian lineup in a moment.
[3664.96 - 3667.20] P:2020.29 E:0.099711 |  The Germans have also made a change.
[3667.20 - 3668.72] P:1841.33 E:0.089463 |  Mertesak has come on for Hummels.
[3669.28 - 3673.92] P:1911.69 E:0.079621 |  And maybe if Hummels has got a slight injury or something,
[3673.92 - 3675.44] P:1858.56 E:0.086177 |  they're now going to preserve him for the final.
[3676.48 - 3678.88] P:1847.11 E:0.090917 |  So it's Ramirez who's come on, not Enrique.
[3678.88 - 3679.92] P:1780.04 E:0.078059 |  Sorry, Ramirez.
[3680.56 - 3683.76] P:1852.25 E:0.079659 |  So that's more logical, because Ramirez can play in that wide position
[3683.76 - 3685.04] P:1839.17 E:0.064488 |  and help out in midfield.
[3685.04 - 3685.76] P:1992.91 E:0.099249 |  Which is interesting.
[3685.76 - 3688.24] P:1747.13 E:0.082461 |  Mike Palinio has just come on, put his hands together,
[3688.24 - 3689.92] P:1763.29 E:0.080247 |  looked up to the sky and prayed.
[3690.88 - 3692.96] P:1820.97 E:0.091343 |  We know this is a very, very religious country.
[3693.68 - 3694.48] P:1915.43 E:0.078162 |  They believe in God.
[3694.48 - 3695.84] P:1729.78 E:0.086306 |  They look to God for an awful lot of things.
[3696.56 - 3700.32] P:1798.50 E:0.068266 |  But to get back in this game is even beyond the miracle now.
[3700.32 - 3703.04] P:1895.31 E:0.076420 |  It's just absolutely staggering.
[3703.04 - 3707.60] P:1855.45 E:0.076096 |  And the action afterwards is going to be very, very interesting to see what happens.
[3707.60 - 3708.32] P:1988.36 E:0.104690 |  That's just sad.
[3709.76 - 3712.80] P:1951.99 E:0.097146 |  All around the nation, there would have been fireworks ready to go tonight.
[3712.80 - 3714.88] P:1840.74 E:0.063733 |  And the way that they have in this tournament,
[3714.88 - 3717.52] P:1928.33 E:0.083148 |  each Brazilian goal celebrated with the fireworks.
[3717.52 - 3719.76] P:1858.73 E:0.064662 |  But I know it's raining in Rio,
[3719.76 - 3724.24] P:1774.28 E:0.066603 |  and it really is a complete and utter damp squib here in Belo Horizonte.
[3724.24 - 3727.68] P:1812.84 E:0.075887 |  So this revised Brazilian line-up in the second half, trailing 5-0,
[3727.68 - 3729.12] P:1906.88 E:0.099108 |  is Giulio Cesar in goal,
[3729.12 - 3731.76] P:1823.62 E:0.077477 |  Maicon, Luis Dante and Marcelo.
[3731.76 - 3736.56] P:1938.38 E:0.087425 |  We'll just break off here as Paolino for the first time gets possession by the corner flag.
[3736.56 - 3739.36] P:1873.95 E:0.073415 |  Brazil playing from right to left in this second half.
[3739.36 - 3742.56] P:1879.59 E:0.086965 |  Plays the ball into Ramirez, switched back to Marcelo once more.
[3742.56 - 3743.60] P:1992.47 E:0.085263 |  Into the penalty area.
[3743.60 - 3745.04] P:2024.93 E:0.104426 |  Ramirez tried to get a shot in.
[3745.04 - 3746.56] P:1889.63 E:0.079670 |  He shovels it all along the ground,
[3746.56 - 3748.64] P:1945.81 E:0.079734 |  and Murdersaka makes his first contribution.
[3749.60 - 3751.28] P:1940.75 E:0.110935 |  So we've got Palinio Gustavo,
[3751.28 - 3753.68] P:1920.09 E:0.082592 |  we've got Ramirez, Oscar Bernad and Fred.
[3754.40 - 3758.32] P:1817.27 E:0.070046 |  And, well, Bernhard hardly got the ball at all in that first half.
[3758.32 - 3761.60] P:1920.38 E:0.083500 |  And yet, if you weren't with us in the first five minutes or so,
[3761.60 - 3764.00] P:1921.68 E:0.079335 |  before Thomas Moura scored after 11 minutes,
[3764.00 - 3765.44] P:1773.48 E:0.079133 |  we thought the Germans were rattled.
[3765.44 - 3766.88] P:1931.57 E:0.075078 |  They seem to be making mistakes.
[3766.88 - 3768.64] P:1830.20 E:0.068810 |  They were giving the ball away.
[3768.64 - 3770.00] P:1943.14 E:0.075739 |  The crowd may be getting at them,
[3770.00 - 3773.68] P:1851.30 E:0.070876 |  because it was a wonderful, wonderful start for Brazil in terms of atmosphere.
[3774.56 - 3776.24] P:1882.27 E:0.092266 |  And without really creating very much,
[3776.24 - 3779.28] P:1919.42 E:0.077223 |  I have to say early on Brazil seemed to have the Germans rattle,
[3779.28 - 3781.04] P:1795.84 E:0.070479 |  but then the goals came flowing in.
[3781.04 - 3785.04] P:1844.68 E:0.082911 |  And the German team is Neuer, Lamm, Bote, Murtisakar and Hovades,
[3785.04 - 3788.88] P:1897.20 E:0.072820 |  Schweinsteiger and Kedira, Moller, Krus, Herzl and Kloser.
[3788.88 - 3790.32] P:1866.11 E:0.072904 |  You're listening to Five Live.
[3790.32 - 3793.04] P:1912.70 E:0.074188 |  We've played two minutes of the second half,
[3793.04 - 3796.32] P:1910.46 E:0.075859 |  and it is just really sad now for the host nation.
[3796.32 - 3797.84] P:1978.20 E:0.095212 |  Five goals in 29 minutes.
[3799.52 - 3802.08] P:1871.65 E:0.084628 |  Blumfontain revisited in terms of England memories,
[3802.08 - 3803.28] P:1725.92 E:0.079818 |  I remember four years ago.
[3804.40 - 3809.28] P:1815.52 E:0.079150 |  And this nation is going to suffer massive withdrawal symptoms.
[3809.36 - 3812.08] P:1789.66 E:0.070986 |  Huge hangover tomorrow in particular.
[3812.08 - 3814.32] P:1885.51 E:0.091505 |  Five nil to Germany, and Brazil and Denis were saying,
[3814.32 - 3819.12] P:1789.90 E:0.071170 |  the record defeat for Brazil is six nil in 1920 by Uruguay.
[3819.12 - 3821.52] P:1833.71 E:0.096963 |  The problem I think we identified early on here, though,
[3821.52 - 3826.80] P:1861.73 E:0.074556 |  was you're going to have a full back like Marcelo rampaging forward
[3826.80 - 3828.40] P:1961.05 E:0.088481 |  in the way that Roberto Carlos used to.
[3829.12 - 3831.60] P:1868.59 E:0.094822 |  In Scolari's team, when Roberto Carlos was going forward,
[3831.60 - 3835.84] P:1940.34 E:0.086612 |  you had people like Cleverson and Gilberto Silva immediately tracking back to help
[3835.84 - 3839.04] P:1849.66 E:0.075775 |  and to cover the back three that they left behind.
[3839.12 - 3841.36] P:1822.62 E:0.080413 |  But that was non-existent, and of course,
[3841.36 - 3846.32] P:1889.75 E:0.085909 |  Muller was the perfect man to really exploit that situation.
[3846.32 - 3847.84] P:1908.57 E:0.094921 |  The ball is down the Brazilian right.
[3847.84 - 3849.52] P:1964.65 E:0.095613 |  Mijkoz ball in towards Fred.
[3849.52 - 3850.48] P:2052.48 E:0.081025 |  Germany defend.
[3850.48 - 3855.68] P:1988.94 E:0.094152 |  Oscar picks the ball up, and then falls easily after the challenge from Boateng.
[3856.32 - 3860.64] P:1903.57 E:0.087048 |  And the ball is back on the halfway line once more with the host nation.
[3860.64 - 3862.56] P:1892.31 E:0.088241 |  Ball played forward, looking for Fred once more.
[3862.56 - 3866.40] P:1970.67 E:0.097016 |  Fred also goes to ground very cheaply there against Mertesaker,
[3866.48 - 3869.20] P:1872.76 E:0.082864 |  and the ball's gone behind for a German goal.
[3869.20 - 3870.08] P:1913.27 E:0.084182 |  Kick, no way to take.
[3870.08 - 3871.76] P:1898.42 E:0.080030 |  Danny, a lot of empty seats.
[3872.32 - 3875.92] P:1819.10 E:0.092225 |  I think a lot of people either have gone to the bar and drowning their sorrows.
[3875.92 - 3877.28] P:1729.57 E:0.085931 |  They're not coming back for the second half.
[3878.00 - 3880.56] P:1798.37 E:0.087331 |  But also now, Holland and Germany, sorry,
[3880.56 - 3883.36] P:1777.25 E:0.085130 |  Holland and Argentina must be looking at this thinking, wow.
[3883.84 - 3886.96] P:1822.07 E:0.095270 |  You know, not only have Germany now got an easy second half,
[3886.96 - 3888.40] P:1827.81 E:0.091096 |  the players will be very, very fresh.
[3888.40 - 3890.00] P:1787.76 E:0.086176 |  They didn't have to work massively hard.
[3890.00 - 3893.36] P:1863.72 E:0.084714 |  Apart from that first 15-minute spell, then it was easy for them.
[3893.36 - 3894.96] P:1829.63 E:0.097251 |  So they are going to be well rested.
[3894.96 - 3897.76] P:1801.20 E:0.073825 |  They'll be very, very fresh for the final.
[3897.76 - 3900.16] P:1877.10 E:0.088939 |  And also, we've seen how devastating the clinical they are.
[3900.96 - 3904.32] P:1765.85 E:0.081111 |  Those are Argentina and Holland will be thinking,
[3904.32 - 3906.16] P:1771.98 E:0.078633 |  wow, yes, we want to get to the final,
[3906.16 - 3910.16] P:1852.34 E:0.082775 |  but we're going to have to go all out and play the better than we've ever played
[3910.16 - 3911.52] P:1917.67 E:0.075384 |  to be this German side.
[3912.72 - 3915.12] P:1860.94 E:0.096963 |  It no longer feels like a World Cup semi-final.
[3915.12 - 3918.72] P:1834.43 E:0.088405 |  It's 5-0 to Germany, and they were leading 5-0
[3918.72 - 3920.96] P:1916.31 E:0.094083 |  after 20 to nine minutes of the first half.
[3920.96 - 3922.48] P:1907.41 E:0.080144 |  You're listening to Five Live.
[3922.48 - 3927.04] P:1815.54 E:0.087669 |  Mertesak, who's come on to equal Franz Beckenbauer's 103 caps,
[3927.04 - 3931.20] P:1839.86 E:0.089741 |  lifts the ball forward, and then it's uncharacteristically given away by Germany.
[3931.20 - 3934.32] P:1856.12 E:0.078403 |  And Brazil just looking for, I was going to say crumbs of comfort,
[3934.32 - 3935.44] P:1742.34 E:0.074296 |  but nothing will comfort them.
[3937.36 - 3938.96] P:1904.94 E:0.098878 |  Absolutely no consolation at all.
[3938.96 - 3941.36] P:1936.93 E:0.092255 |  David Luiz now crosses the half-way line.
[3941.36 - 3943.12] P:1941.93 E:0.104335 |  Luiz with the ball on to Ramirez.
[3943.12 - 3947.76] P:1976.68 E:0.097727 |  Ramirez, and that pass was misplaced to Marcello down the left-hand side.
[3947.76 - 3949.04] P:2003.20 E:0.102584 |  Bernard offers his services.
[3949.04 - 3952.00] P:1966.52 E:0.095023 |  The ball goes in, and there's an opportunity maybe for Paulinho,
[3952.00 - 3955.68] P:1935.46 E:0.093151 |  but immediately the Germans smother around Paulinho.
[3955.68 - 3956.96] P:1989.37 E:0.097141 |  Ball lifted into the far post.
[3956.96 - 3961.60] P:1901.46 E:0.082397 |  And Neuer, I think he touched that, but it's been kept in by Erzl.
[3961.60 - 3964.24] P:1916.51 E:0.083207 |  And what a great ball out of defence by Mesut Erzl.
[3964.24 - 3966.56] P:1949.39 E:0.097409 |  Miroslav closer, by the way, in the first half,
[3967.12 - 3971.76] P:1922.93 E:0.089106 |  has now gone past Ronaldo with his 16 goals at World Cup finals.
[3971.76 - 3974.08] P:1852.06 E:0.092756 |  But Danny's saying now we expect Muller on 10 goals
[3974.08 - 3975.52] P:1959.82 E:0.089141 |  to at least go past that.
[3975.52 - 3977.52] P:2006.53 E:0.094409 |  Ball played up now towards Oscar.
[3977.52 - 3979.04] P:1918.91 E:0.089207 |  Fred lays it to Ramirez.
[3979.04 - 3982.96] P:2017.72 E:0.096837 |  Ramirez's shot may find Fred on the edge of the area.
[3982.96 - 3984.08] P:1979.19 E:0.117438 |  He releases Ramirez.
[3984.08 - 3986.40] P:1945.91 E:0.101687 |  Ramirez cut back, diving save from Neuer.
[3986.40 - 3989.52] P:1972.20 E:0.089006 |  Just about the first real save he's had to make.
[3989.52 - 3993.04] P:1958.08 E:0.086086 |  Erzl keeps the ball in over on the far side by the corner flag,
[3993.04 - 3994.64] P:1908.99 E:0.090292 |  and then Botein completes the clearance.
[3994.64 - 3997.04] P:1920.86 E:0.092320 |  And it was caught late as well as he released that ball.
[3997.04 - 3998.64] P:1849.90 E:0.086912 |  But the referee continues the game,
[3998.64 - 4000.88] P:1914.08 E:0.093295 |  closer dances around a few challenges.
[4000.88 - 4003.36] P:1950.70 E:0.098032 |  Muller's there, it's tight over on the far side.
[4003.36 - 4005.12] P:1984.46 E:0.091245 |  Brazil have the ball again.
[4005.12 - 4006.48] P:1987.43 E:0.103045 |  Lifted forward by Luiz.
[4007.12 - 4010.96] P:1919.92 E:0.081627 |  Header back by Philippe Larm, and Neuer will come out of his area.
[4010.96 - 4013.12] P:1917.03 E:0.088310 |  And then lift the ball as far as he can,
[4013.12 - 4015.92] P:1853.13 E:0.077127 |  away from his penalty area, back into the Brazilian half.
[4015.92 - 4017.20] P:1914.15 E:0.103634 |  Well, Brazil should have scored then.
[4017.20 - 4021.36] P:1859.70 E:0.095209 |  Ramirez down the right-hand side, got in a really good position.
[4021.36 - 4024.24] P:1876.92 E:0.087635 |  And he was played in by Fred, I think it was.
[4024.24 - 4027.28] P:1937.65 E:0.089331 |  Went to cut the ball back across goal for Oscar.
[4027.28 - 4029.20] P:1980.32 E:0.098676 |  But even Ramirez, he was not in the first half.
[4029.84 - 4032.72] P:1891.58 E:0.083601 |  No belief, no conviction about that pass.
[4032.72 - 4035.84] P:1847.13 E:0.080814 |  And a simple push out, if you like, for Neuer in the end.
[4035.84 - 4039.12] P:1943.68 E:0.083603 |  Five-mil to Germany, at least Asia to the second half.
[4039.12 - 4042.40] P:1842.65 E:0.093527 |  And just the record, by the way, I'm going to say that I was disappointed
[4042.40 - 4046.40] P:1896.09 E:0.081851 |  that they didn't at least put a picture of Alfredo de Stefano up here
[4046.40 - 4049.44] P:1868.98 E:0.084994 |  to show the crowd, because I know he wasn't identified with the World Cup,
[4049.44 - 4051.12] P:1913.39 E:0.093691 |  but he was one of the game's great players,
[4051.12 - 4052.80] P:1885.51 E:0.095701 |  and he sadly passed away yesterday.
[4052.80 - 4054.72] P:1926.17 E:0.089407 |  That should have been recognised here tonight.
[4054.72 - 4058.16] P:1979.18 E:0.108852 |  Here now, Ramirez, ball in the area, save by Neuer.
[4058.16 - 4060.72] P:1979.10 E:0.101115 |  And nothing is dropping Brazil's way.
[4060.72 - 4062.88] P:1921.42 E:0.093007 |  Nobody there, Fred wasn't there to follow up.
[4062.88 - 4064.88] P:1845.65 E:0.093760 |  Erzal having to play as a left back at the moment.
[4065.60 - 4068.72] P:1900.17 E:0.096243 |  And you can understand the Germans in many ways now.
[4068.72 - 4070.64] P:1910.78 E:0.087405 |  It's cruise control for them, isn't it?
[4070.64 - 4073.44] P:1904.17 E:0.088118 |  They know that there's no way back here for the opposition.
[4074.16 - 4075.20] P:1911.22 E:0.099991 |  And they're really just...
[4075.20 - 4078.08] P:1856.44 E:0.087746 |  I don't know how ambitious they're going to be in the second half, Danny.
[4078.08 - 4080.16] P:1874.48 E:0.091739 |  Well, they won't need to be ambitious at all.
[4080.16 - 4082.72] P:1877.75 E:0.091199 |  But they'll get a couple of chances, it's just where they take them.
[4082.72 - 4084.96] P:1772.52 E:0.088942 |  But bizarrely, Brazil couldn't score two already.
[4084.96 - 4088.32] P:1792.13 E:0.083683 |  Ramirez got in, then they're out on the side, couldn't cut the ball back for Oscar.
[4088.32 - 4090.08] P:1761.80 E:0.081273 |  And Oscar should have put that ball away.
[4090.08 - 4091.04] P:1824.90 E:0.079094 |  You know, simple.
[4091.76 - 4093.36] P:1904.38 E:0.098802 |  But the only... Ten yards from goal.
[4093.36 - 4095.68] P:1822.88 E:0.087122 |  Only countries to score against Germany in this tournament.
[4095.68 - 4098.96] P:1875.61 E:0.084745 |  The African countries, Algeria and Ghana, but here come Brazil again.
[4098.96 - 4101.36] P:1944.00 E:0.096765 |  But Germany seem to be quite happy to allow them to have the ball.
[4101.36 - 4102.64] P:1996.97 E:0.100325 |  Bernard's in the area.
[4102.64 - 4106.00] P:1929.97 E:0.079620 |  Challenge came in from Muller.
[4106.00 - 4107.28] P:1909.48 E:0.088961 |  And the corner kick is given.
[4107.28 - 4109.84] P:1942.28 E:0.090106 |  A replacement ball immediately thrown to Bernard.
[4109.84 - 4112.48] P:1928.81 E:0.093100 |  We've played seven and a half minutes at the second half.
[4112.48 - 4114.16] P:1937.63 E:0.084260 |  We've now got two balls on the field.
[4114.16 - 4116.64] P:1918.50 E:0.084078 |  One is cleared. Bernard will take this corner.
[4116.64 - 4119.04] P:1943.10 E:0.085862 |  Brazil have made two changes at halftime.
[4119.04 - 4122.56] P:1930.32 E:0.088236 |  Dante by Munich, making his way to the far post.
[4122.64 - 4123.52] P:2014.28 E:0.094520 |  In goes the corner kick.
[4123.52 - 4125.36] P:1953.43 E:0.086989 |  Noia gets a really good fist to it.
[4125.36 - 4128.16] P:1870.74 E:0.091919 |  Might drop to Marcelo, who gets the head of Ozil.
[4128.16 - 4132.80] P:1890.26 E:0.085558 |  Marcelo looking to set up a shot, but Schweinsteiger immediately comes in with a great challenge.
[4132.80 - 4135.20] P:1907.47 E:0.098227 |  And here come the Brazilians once more.
[4135.20 - 4136.32] P:1989.73 E:0.106095 |  Paulinho in the area.
[4136.32 - 4138.08] P:2042.32 E:0.105709 |  Paulinho shot straight at Noia.
[4138.08 - 4139.28] P:2018.56 E:0.098122 |  Paulinho again.
[4139.28 - 4140.40] P:1946.06 E:0.098278 |  Noia makes another save.
[4141.20 - 4143.92] P:1901.59 E:0.088253 |  And comes to the referee and complains about something.
[4143.92 - 4145.36] P:1778.50 E:0.088324 |  How good is Manuel Noia?
[4146.08 - 4146.64] P:1861.86 E:0.108743 |  Fabulous.
[4147.20 - 4149.44] P:1857.22 E:0.097673 |  Paulinho was on the side.
[4150.08 - 4151.12] P:2000.52 E:0.097151 |  Short corner taken.
[4151.12 - 4153.84] P:1968.10 E:0.087795 |  Marcelo over on that far side.
[4154.40 - 4156.88] P:1957.23 E:0.082147 |  Digs the ball back to Maicon.
[4156.88 - 4161.12] P:1943.07 E:0.091501 |  Maicon now taking it forward as far as Ozil will allow him.
[4161.12 - 4163.28] P:1917.59 E:0.091057 |  And then there's a misplaced pass from him.
[4163.28 - 4166.96] P:1980.83 E:0.095553 |  So Manuel Noia who made that wonderful save against Benzema
[4166.96 - 4172.16] P:1937.06 E:0.092748 |  at the end of the quarterfinal in Rio stands up firm once more for the Germans here tonight.
[4173.52 - 4174.80] P:1894.47 E:0.094591 |  It's a brilliant double save, Mike.
[4174.80 - 4176.48] P:1967.10 E:0.102072 |  The first one, he stood tall, strong.
[4176.48 - 4177.76] P:1866.86 E:0.076537 |  The ball almost hit him.
[4177.76 - 4178.88] P:1972.72 E:0.090971 |  Came back to Paulinho again.
[4178.96 - 4181.68] P:1971.90 E:0.086671 |  Just a little flick with his left hand.
[4181.68 - 4184.08] P:1951.19 E:0.095077 |  But such a strong arm that he's got.
[4184.08 - 4188.24] P:1853.13 E:0.084055 |  Puts his hand up and the ball bounces like 30, 40 yards away.
[4188.24 - 4190.24] P:1884.53 E:0.078818 |  Noia is absolutely immense.
[4190.24 - 4193.04] P:1973.83 E:0.093183 |  Bernard at least is trying a few flicks down this left hand side,
[4193.04 - 4195.12] P:1962.36 E:0.078264 |  trying to get the crowd lifted.
[4195.12 - 4196.32] P:1978.49 E:0.103866 |  But it's an impossible job.
[4196.88 - 4200.72] P:1987.94 E:0.086040 |  And now Germany with a great ball out of defense.
[4200.72 - 4202.48] P:1896.38 E:0.103346 |  Find Muller down this right hand side.
[4202.48 - 4205.36] P:1927.48 E:0.094673 |  In comes Luis Gustavo and the challenge has been penalized.
[4205.36 - 4208.40] P:1908.28 E:0.091917 |  And it's a free kick to Germany just inside the Brazil high.
[4208.40 - 4209.60] P:1871.47 E:0.100907 |  Just noted David Louise.
[4209.60 - 4213.04] P:1838.07 E:0.089193 |  He's gone from centre half and he's ran 40 yards up the field
[4213.04 - 4216.80] P:1817.43 E:0.082353 |  to try and close down with field players for Germany.
[4216.80 - 4218.40] P:1873.62 E:0.094547 |  Now Muller down the German right.
[4218.40 - 4220.80] P:1897.48 E:0.088060 |  Muller's beefy ball to the far side.
[4220.80 - 4223.36] P:1808.56 E:0.087321 |  And I suppose, I hope this isn't going to sound cruel,
[4223.36 - 4224.64] P:1915.20 E:0.096988 |  but maybe we've seen here tonight,
[4224.64 - 4228.72] P:1797.39 E:0.083869 |  why perhaps Jose Mourinho hasn't retained the services of David Louise as a defender.
[4229.28 - 4231.36] P:1873.60 E:0.095410 |  Well, quite possible because he wasn't disciplined enough.
[4231.36 - 4234.48] P:1832.07 E:0.087223 |  He lost his concentration, got wrapped up in the moment.
[4235.28 - 4236.08] P:1868.50 E:0.102026 |  And you can't do that.
[4236.08 - 4240.24] P:1852.66 E:0.085569 |  You've got to have, you know, fire in your belly, you know, but ice in your head.
[4241.04 - 4243.20] P:1876.75 E:0.085807 |  That's not the sort of player that he is.
[4243.20 - 4246.00] P:1749.56 E:0.080090 |  And obviously, I'm 40, 50 million euros, whatever it was,
[4246.00 - 4249.04] P:1825.03 E:0.080183 |  it's probably a good price for him.
[4249.60 - 4251.28] P:1824.43 E:0.091787 |  Jochim Lowe, I think, would have said at half time,
[4252.24 - 4253.28] P:1792.99 E:0.083900 |  keep yourselves out of trouble.
[4254.16 - 4255.28] P:1810.08 E:0.096704 |  Don't overdo anything.
[4255.28 - 4256.80] P:1857.23 E:0.090720 |  Don't overstretch for anything.
[4256.80 - 4259.04] P:1846.43 E:0.083707 |  You know, you can see the goal, not a problem.
[4259.04 - 4261.36] P:1944.54 E:0.085591 |  Keep yourselves fit, stay out of trouble,
[4262.08 - 4263.68] P:1846.45 E:0.093345 |  and just then, you know, just see the game out.
[4264.48 - 4269.36] P:1972.55 E:0.102954 |  This is five-life, and Marcelo has the ball for Brazil down this left hand side of the field,
[4269.36 - 4272.16] P:1918.84 E:0.100222 |  and then it's a topoker, which Oscar will not get.
[4272.16 - 4274.16] P:1919.36 E:0.093929 |  If you're just joining us, what is it back home?
[4274.16 - 4275.28] P:1810.58 E:0.099081 |  10 pass, 10 in the evening.
[4277.04 - 4278.08] P:1899.54 E:0.112191 |  This is the score line.
[4278.08 - 4279.04] P:1765.16 E:0.089530 |  Well, where have you been for one?
[4279.04 - 4280.16] P:1820.43 E:0.107023 |  Well, this is the score line.
[4281.68 - 4285.44] P:1904.44 E:0.095728 |  Brazil nailed Germany five, and this is the World Cup semi-final,
[4285.44 - 4290.16] P:1835.90 E:0.088794 |  and I have never seen balloons punctured to the extent that they were here this evening.
[4290.16 - 4292.64] P:1785.91 E:0.084088 |  I've never seen an atmosphere in a stadium
[4292.72 - 4294.08] P:1825.24 E:0.093197 |  subside the way it did here.
[4294.08 - 4297.92] P:1705.77 E:0.091459 |  The Brazilians came out to unbelievable support.
[4298.56 - 4302.08] P:1783.17 E:0.094581 |  Never heard an anthem sing as sung as loudly as it was here,
[4302.08 - 4306.16] P:1927.08 E:0.094400 |  and they started okay, and the Germans looked as if they were a bit affected by the occasion.
[4306.72 - 4310.40] P:1823.39 E:0.096387 |  But then once Muller stroked them into a lead, unmarked, following a corner,
[4311.12 - 4314.96] P:1867.77 E:0.085715 |  well, then the goals came from closer, that record 16th at the World Cup,
[4314.96 - 4316.88] P:1879.52 E:0.085162 |  two from Croce, and then Kedira.
[4317.76 - 4322.32] P:1861.13 E:0.080778 |  Five-nil to Germany, and I think now it's very safe to say
[4322.80 - 4328.40] P:1794.50 E:0.079283 |  that the 2014 World Cup final will be Germany against either Argentina or Holland.
[4328.40 - 4333.60] P:1829.36 E:0.088208 |  Could be an all-European final, or it could be for the third time in a World Cup final,
[4333.60 - 4336.80] P:1883.15 E:0.083888 |  Germany against Argentina, one-one in the previous finals.
[4337.36 - 4340.24] P:1812.03 E:0.088510 |  Muller now down the left-hand side, Erzels there,
[4340.24 - 4342.64] P:1917.39 E:0.093562 |  just inside, lovely running again from Muller.
[4342.64 - 4344.80] P:1976.94 E:0.085707 |  Croce is looking interested.
[4344.80 - 4346.48] P:1957.63 E:0.104080 |  Muller's going to run towards the dead ball line,
[4346.48 - 4348.24] P:1931.91 E:0.090571 |  and try and pull this ball back for closer.
[4348.24 - 4350.88] P:1837.67 E:0.086040 |  Damn it, he's all knocked it back to goalkeeper.
[4350.88 - 4355.12] P:1860.85 E:0.084554 |  Giulio says, ah, and just about got away with that one.
[4355.12 - 4358.40] P:1737.48 E:0.082415 |  And as Brazil move forward, Joachim Lowe,
[4358.40 - 4362.00] P:1916.64 E:0.087711 |  even though he's leading five-nil, is still conducting his team down below.
[4362.00 - 4365.76] P:1911.34 E:0.095758 |  Out comes Neuer, and he got there first ahead of Ramirez,
[4366.32 - 4369.76] P:1953.97 E:0.096882 |  looked to be body checks, and then the referee's going to make a great song and dance of it, though.
[4370.40 - 4372.00] P:1925.03 E:0.071019 |  He's just going to give the free kick.
[4372.00 - 4376.96] P:1833.75 E:0.080717 |  Yeah, Manuel Neuer won the free kick, got tripped up, did 17 rollovers,
[4376.96 - 4379.68] P:1834.34 E:0.079429 |  but then to be fair to him, did jump up straight away.
[4379.76 - 4381.04] P:1934.98 E:0.086404 |  Now, you know, you talk about how seriously
[4381.04 - 4382.56] P:1799.18 E:0.085052 |  will Germany take this second half.
[4383.20 - 4385.60] P:1738.84 E:0.083225 |  Well, I tell you what, Muller's on, what, five goals now.
[4386.48 - 4388.80] P:1813.79 E:0.078114 |  Obviously, how many Rodriguez out of the tournament on six?
[4390.40 - 4392.80] P:1691.55 E:0.088459 |  I'm sure. Muller won the goal, but last one now.
[4392.80 - 4394.08] P:1870.43 E:0.100505 |  Yes, he did, yes, he did with five.
[4394.08 - 4395.28] P:1890.72 E:0.089735 |  Has anybody ever won it?
[4395.28 - 4395.92] P:1890.48 E:0.089223 |  Twice in a row?
[4395.92 - 4396.56] P:1663.77 E:0.111130 |  Twice in a row.
[4396.56 - 4398.96] P:1773.01 E:0.088958 |  Well, at the moment, he's got that incentive, obviously,
[4398.96 - 4402.08] P:1848.09 E:0.084645 |  his lamb now playing it right back, and he does look so much better.
[4402.08 - 4405.76] P:1859.38 E:0.086864 |  And he's great in midfield, but he is exceptional at right back,
[4405.76 - 4409.36] P:1937.58 E:0.085185 |  and now Scherler of Chelsea is going to come into the game,
[4409.36 - 4411.28] P:1883.38 E:0.093092 |  and he's going to replace Closar.
[4411.28 - 4414.64] P:1956.68 E:0.092038 |  Well, Closar's got his 16th World Cup finals goal.
[4414.64 - 4419.04] P:1906.63 E:0.091236 |  And remember, he played in that 2002 final in Yokohama.
[4419.04 - 4421.76] P:2018.75 E:0.104356 |  The Brazilian team on that occasion was much stronger
[4421.76 - 4424.88] P:1980.81 E:0.098115 |  than this Brazilian team, and the German team on that occasion,
[4424.88 - 4426.72] P:1964.27 E:0.103121 |  nothing like as strong as this German team.
[4427.28 - 4429.44] P:2021.87 E:0.103831 |  So, Closar's replaced by Scherler.
[4429.44 - 4433.36] P:1981.77 E:0.099749 |  Scherler, who's given the Germany side good service in this World Cup,
[4433.36 - 4436.08] P:1921.25 E:0.092553 |  coming on for the last half an hour, always a threat,
[4436.08 - 4438.80] P:1867.56 E:0.087160 |  and he's going to run hard at this Brazilian defence,
[4438.80 - 4441.76] P:1828.67 E:0.092594 |  and maybe cause even more anxiety around the stadium.
[4442.48 - 4445.04] P:1926.84 E:0.087735 |  Diving header away by Germany.
[4445.04 - 4448.16] P:1722.57 E:0.086298 |  Brazil regroup in midfield with Paulinho.
[4448.16 - 4450.80] P:1785.94 E:0.090983 |  Paulinho now for Luis Gustavo.
[4450.80 - 4452.64] P:1859.90 E:0.101882 |  That ball towards Marcelo is a bit short,
[4452.64 - 4455.12] P:1932.44 E:0.102782 |  and then as he drifts in field, he's caught by Scherler.
[4456.40 - 4458.00] P:1791.39 E:0.091220 |  But I mean, everything is...
[4458.00 - 4460.88] P:1851.69 E:0.089065 |  The bottom has just dropped out of this semi-final,
[4460.88 - 4463.60] P:1913.57 E:0.097786 |  in terms of anticipation and expectation,
[4464.16 - 4466.80] P:1820.19 E:0.098925 |  and everything that we were looking forward to really here today.
[4467.36 - 4470.48] P:1843.64 E:0.099179 |  This is so one-sided and so sad for the host nation,
[4470.48 - 4471.52] P:1861.19 E:0.094377 |  as the ball is played in.
[4472.56 - 4475.28] P:1817.12 E:0.096801 |  And the other thing is, Danny, in the aftermath of all of this,
[4475.28 - 4479.76] P:1947.79 E:0.088386 |  I mean, most of the talk is going to be about Brazil,
[4479.76 - 4481.84] P:1833.51 E:0.084406 |  but I wonder how much credit Germany are going to get
[4481.84 - 4484.00] P:1750.41 E:0.072373 |  for turning them over here in such a way tonight?
[4484.56 - 4485.60] P:1807.82 E:0.094100 |  Well, they've been incredible.
[4486.56 - 4491.68] P:1850.35 E:0.084073 |  They've just sort of epitomised everything that German football is about.
[4492.40 - 4493.52] P:2009.78 E:0.118077 |  She would do chance from Fred,
[4493.52 - 4495.44] P:1960.49 E:0.103223 |  but he doesn't really get anything on it at all.
[4496.00 - 4498.88] P:1968.46 E:0.109874 |  Straight at Muller, and there are immediately boos around the stadium,
[4498.88 - 4502.32] P:1979.63 E:0.091434 |  because I think that they thought Fred could have had more of a stab at that one.
[4503.12 - 4508.24] P:1919.98 E:0.091820 |  Kedira moving forward, already now, nearly 15 minutes gone in the second half,
[4508.24 - 4510.48] P:1975.50 E:0.087050 |  and the ball is through to Scherler.
[4510.48 - 4513.36] P:1875.19 E:0.077272 |  He won't chase that, because I think he would have been offside,
[4513.36 - 4514.48] P:1806.18 E:0.081324 |  and the ball is back with...
[4514.48 - 4515.68] P:1823.77 E:0.091863 |  Julio says, ah, the goalie.
[4515.68 - 4519.52] P:1809.93 E:0.097420 |  Just checking, Mike. No-one's ever won the Golden Boot twice in a row.
[4520.40 - 4521.20] P:1698.43 E:0.089512 |  Well, cut, obviously.
[4521.20 - 4523.12] P:1816.39 E:0.095318 |  Muller needs one more goal to...
[4523.12 - 4524.16] P:2052.24 E:0.109446 |  Oh, given away!
[4524.16 - 4526.00] P:1967.66 E:0.102494 |  And he goes to Muller looking for another goal,
[4526.00 - 4527.28] P:1891.54 E:0.082805 |  and he goes round the goalkeeper.
[4527.28 - 4531.36] P:1969.49 E:0.091702 |  No, he doesn't, because Julio Cesar managed to get something on the ground there,
[4531.36 - 4534.08] P:1883.06 E:0.090800 |  and Germany have to settle for the corner kickover on the far side.
[4534.08 - 4535.28] P:1780.48 E:0.096726 |  Just like no-one's done it twice,
[4535.28 - 4538.56] P:1805.72 E:0.087939 |  Muller nearly put himself in prime position to do that.
[4538.56 - 4542.00] P:1807.31 E:0.087562 |  So my able, glamorous assistant Ian Dennis was looking up.
[4542.00 - 4543.44] P:1713.74 E:0.088804 |  It only went back to 1978,
[4543.44 - 4545.36] P:1732.02 E:0.082280 |  so we needed the internet for a little bit of extra help.
[4545.92 - 4548.32] P:1901.53 E:0.091283 |  Well, he's one short at the moment of Rodriguez,
[4548.96 - 4551.28] P:1790.09 E:0.083802 |  the Colombian who leads with six at this tournament,
[4551.28 - 4554.00] P:1921.74 E:0.086807 |  short corner for Germany, leading by five goals to nil.
[4554.24 - 4557.04] P:1892.90 E:0.081469 |  Ball is played back to Schveinsteiger on the edge of the area.
[4557.04 - 4557.84] P:1892.98 E:0.082319 |  Now Kedira.
[4558.56 - 4561.12] P:1884.32 E:0.090366 |  Muller's looking interested once more inside that penalty area.
[4561.84 - 4562.96] P:1912.97 E:0.084150 |  Ball goes back to Kedira.
[4562.96 - 4565.20] P:1847.10 E:0.076865 |  Muller's pointing, give it to me to my feet here.
[4565.20 - 4567.76] P:1951.26 E:0.090376 |  Kedira, instead, though, finds Tony Kruse.
[4567.76 - 4570.16] P:1980.72 E:0.099596 |  Tony Kruse now onto Muller, edge of the area.
[4570.16 - 4571.36] P:1966.63 E:0.097573 |  Militant shot on!
[4571.36 - 4574.72] P:1982.79 E:0.089732 |  And Julio Cesar turns it away, one-handed for a corner kicker.
[4574.72 - 4578.16] P:1961.21 E:0.088596 |  Now, I think that just amplifies everything we've been saying about Thomas Muller.
[4578.88 - 4579.92] P:1902.24 E:0.087647 |  Fabulous player.
[4579.92 - 4581.60] P:1894.95 E:0.078492 |  Left foot, right foot.
[4581.68 - 4585.12] P:1933.15 E:0.088199 |  He gets himself in a little bit of space, just turned.
[4585.12 - 4587.84] P:1807.04 E:0.081054 |  He's just tried to bend the ball into the top corner.
[4587.84 - 4589.36] P:1912.03 E:0.091140 |  In the end, it was a fabulous save.
[4590.32 - 4593.60] P:1925.87 E:0.093815 |  Another short corner to Germany, five-nil they lead.
[4593.60 - 4596.16] P:1924.10 E:0.090974 |  Ball played forward and then given away this time by Germany.
[4596.72 - 4600.00] P:1793.41 E:0.083625 |  And it'll be brought out from the back by Dante.
[4600.00 - 4602.88] P:1888.74 E:0.091983 |  And Dante just hoops the ball towards the halfway line.
[4602.88 - 4605.28] P:1930.52 E:0.092978 |  Bernard does well in the air, gets above Lawn.
[4605.28 - 4608.16] P:1965.45 E:0.088594 |  Fred's slow to control that, but then eventually gets it.
[4608.16 - 4610.24] P:1949.45 E:0.088521 |  And the crowd of Bullying Fred here,
[4610.32 - 4611.44] P:1997.05 E:0.092259 |  there's a question about that.
[4611.44 - 4614.24] P:1863.73 E:0.079569 |  Fred is getting some grief from the crowd here.
[4614.24 - 4617.84] P:1853.08 E:0.083746 |  And Oscar, I'm not quite sure why they're targeting him in particular,
[4617.84 - 4622.64] P:1884.95 E:0.083394 |  because nobody down there has done themselves any favours tonight in the Brazil side.
[4622.64 - 4624.96] P:1989.30 E:0.084524 |  It's Bernard now, down the left.
[4624.96 - 4627.84] P:1896.27 E:0.086422 |  Krosk comes Schveinsteiger, Schöler rather.
[4627.84 - 4631.92] P:1949.00 E:0.091129 |  The ball is played into David Luiz, who got that thrilling goal, of course, in the last round.
[4631.92 - 4634.24] P:1991.20 E:0.095047 |  Ball chipped into Maicon in the penalty area.
[4634.24 - 4637.68] P:1971.22 E:0.100844 |  Maicon tries to bring it down, takes the tumble, again looking for a penalty.
[4637.68 - 4640.40] P:1965.09 E:0.090381 |  Germans complaining, corner kick is given only.
[4640.40 - 4643.84] P:1970.82 E:0.097243 |  And I think the Germans are just saying to the referee, that was another dive,
[4643.84 - 4646.00] P:1918.07 E:0.084251 |  probably the third in the second half.
[4646.00 - 4647.76] P:1943.24 E:0.090076 |  The Brazilians are getting desperate.
[4647.76 - 4649.52] P:1855.82 E:0.091683 |  Oscar's got a corner over on the far side.
[4649.52 - 4650.32] P:1808.66 E:0.059885 |  What do you think of that?
[4650.32 - 4652.72] P:1873.45 E:0.088428 |  Well, Brazilian players are trying, anytime they get the box,
[4652.72 - 4654.48] P:1922.56 E:0.080092 |  they go into ground far too easily.
[4654.48 - 4656.08] P:1869.53 E:0.083400 |  Anything for a consolation at the moment.
[4656.80 - 4660.48] P:1992.57 E:0.096115 |  5-0 to Germany, corner kick to Brazil, over on the far side.
[4660.48 - 4662.88] P:2028.96 E:0.088840 |  A backward header by Schöler to clear.
[4662.88 - 4664.32] P:2101.30 E:0.096159 |  But now Bernard lifts it in,
[4664.40 - 4668.32] P:1914.06 E:0.089862 |  Annoyus there once more with those capable hands in the German goal.
[4668.96 - 4672.40] P:1944.19 E:0.092201 |  Holes onto the ball and then throws it out, gets good distance.
[4672.40 - 4674.24] P:1822.63 E:0.079787 |  Erzl up against Maicon.
[4674.24 - 4678.00] P:1929.54 E:0.086125 |  Maicon from the angle gives it back again to Julio Cesar,
[4678.00 - 4679.44] P:1833.09 E:0.078022 |  the goalkeeper away to the right.
[4679.44 - 4687.60] P:1929.63 E:0.087991 |  Well, Scolari, of course, had the stress and strain of being with the host Portugal in Euro 2004
[4687.60 - 4689.84] P:1947.13 E:0.087467 |  and losing the final against Greece.
[4689.84 - 4691.84] P:1873.27 E:0.083101 |  That was hard for him, this is worse.
[4691.84 - 4693.92] P:1844.86 E:0.089641 |  As a Brazilian, he'll be feeling this.
[4694.00 - 4698.32] P:1880.91 E:0.084263 |  As his team go forward and the ball in is poor really towards Fred
[4698.32 - 4702.08] P:1918.44 E:0.081007 |  and Germany easily clear to the far side of the field.
[4702.08 - 4705.76] P:1774.56 E:0.087675 |  You have to remember that normally the Brazilian press conference is very, very long.
[4706.80 - 4708.00] P:1814.98 E:0.095918 |  I just wonder...
[4708.00 - 4710.16] P:1931.97 E:0.097389 |  We've just got a picture of Ronaldo, by the way there.
[4710.16 - 4710.96] P:1993.44 E:0.097747 |  Well, it's...
[4710.96 - 4713.12] P:2036.23 E:0.094328 |  Commentating here for Brazilian TV, I imagine.
[4713.12 - 4714.08] P:1815.87 E:0.097013 |  It's a double blow, isn't it?
[4714.08 - 4718.80] P:1910.77 E:0.084028 |  Because he's lost his record to Murph's life closer and he then thumps 5-0.
[4720.64 - 4722.32] P:1953.57 E:0.089048 |  It's just incredible now.
[4722.32 - 4724.72] P:1987.14 E:0.082579 |  The game has become a nothing game.
[4724.72 - 4727.84] P:2026.32 E:0.101213 |  Well, it's an exercise in total futility now for Brazil.
[4727.84 - 4729.60] P:1910.96 E:0.087175 |  Germany are quite happy with them to have the ball
[4729.60 - 4731.68] P:1961.35 E:0.092747 |  because Brazil keep giving it away anyway.
[4731.68 - 4733.68] P:1939.21 E:0.091136 |  And that's been threaded through from Marcelo,
[4733.68 - 4737.84] P:1881.37 E:0.087806 |  straight through to Manuel Neuer in the German goal away to our left.
[4738.96 - 4740.96] P:1972.25 E:0.107852 |  I mean, when England shot Germany in Munich,
[4740.96 - 4743.44] P:1895.43 E:0.093693 |  that was quite a stunning evening, but that was a qualifying game.
[4743.44 - 4745.52] P:1828.51 E:0.085100 |  That wasn't the semi-final of the World Cup.
[4745.52 - 4747.84] P:1935.57 E:0.096228 |  And now here we go with Paulinho for Brazil.
[4747.84 - 4749.04] P:1942.14 E:0.093610 |  Ramirez makes the run.
[4749.04 - 4750.88] P:1954.24 E:0.097135 |  Paulinho's overrun that one though
[4750.96 - 4753.84] P:1922.07 E:0.088811 |  and Hovhards, who hasn't missed very much at left-back clears
[4753.84 - 4755.12] P:1855.56 E:0.085182 |  and the ball is back once more.
[4755.12 - 4758.24] P:1766.03 E:0.092643 |  And still Jochen Lowe, it's him down there, not Scolari,
[4758.80 - 4761.20] P:1877.71 E:0.085668 |  trying to sort of keep his side going,
[4761.20 - 4762.24] P:1824.72 E:0.087965 |  even though they're leading 5-0.
[4762.24 - 4765.52] P:1921.52 E:0.089597 |  He wants a focus, I suppose, as Bernard gives chase once more.
[4765.52 - 4767.04] P:1922.09 E:0.089658 |  Neuer has to get back in his goal.
[4767.04 - 4769.20] P:1987.19 E:0.094003 |  Bernard's ball in to nobody at all,
[4769.20 - 4771.20] P:1966.47 E:0.083083 |  apart from the German left-back Hovhards,
[4771.20 - 4772.96] P:1905.49 E:0.086692 |  and that's a no-nonsense clearance from him
[4773.60 - 4776.08] P:1833.94 E:0.094732 |  onto the Belo Horizonte sign over on the far side.
[4776.64 - 4779.04] P:1799.44 E:0.080774 |  And Brazil quickly take the throw.
[4779.04 - 4781.92] P:1819.60 E:0.089214 |  Five live, 18.5 minutes gone in the second half.
[4781.92 - 4785.28] P:1881.55 E:0.084813 |  The most amazing World Cup first half here in a semi-final,
[4785.84 - 4789.60] P:1873.26 E:0.085957 |  with Germany going into a 5-0 lead inside half an hour.
[4789.60 - 4790.72] P:1820.51 E:0.090890 |  So just going back to that, Mike,
[4790.72 - 4792.24] P:1777.64 E:0.086576 |  normally the Brazilian press conferences
[4792.24 - 4794.96] P:1722.81 E:0.082142 |  an hour and a half long, we could be here all night.
[4796.80 - 4799.68] P:1924.64 E:0.085037 |  The post-mortem for this is not just me tonight.
[4799.68 - 4803.52] P:1864.01 E:0.081906 |  It's going to go on for days, for months, possibly even years.
[4804.24 - 4807.28] P:1826.75 E:0.085536 |  This is just so unprecedented
[4807.28 - 4810.80] P:1811.91 E:0.081434 |  and to happen on your home turf is just unbelievable.
[4810.80 - 4812.16] P:1891.18 E:0.102270 |  Here they come again, the Germans,
[4812.16 - 4814.80] P:1932.51 E:0.099703 |  and the ball is played into the area. Cesar will get there.
[4815.36 - 4818.40] P:1899.06 E:0.085660 |  And all the television channels here,
[4818.40 - 4819.84] P:1835.02 E:0.092073 |  from breakfast time onwards this morning,
[4819.84 - 4822.64] P:1835.24 E:0.085284 |  it's been wall-to-wall coverage, as you would expect,
[4822.64 - 4824.24] P:1785.80 E:0.081616 |  building up to this game.
[4824.24 - 4826.88] P:1837.39 E:0.089329 |  200 million Brazilians hopeful,
[4826.88 - 4830.32] P:1995.02 E:0.094940 |  and here now goes Bernard, and it's a lost course for them.
[4830.32 - 4833.76] P:1958.73 E:0.093251 |  Bernard's ball lead, even that wasn't measured right to Paulinho,
[4833.76 - 4835.76] P:1889.76 E:0.086450 |  and then he was a little bit late,
[4835.84 - 4838.08] P:1830.04 E:0.088911 |  he's caught one of the German players over on the far side,
[4838.72 - 4843.52] P:1797.64 E:0.082110 |  and Jokam Lohr, of course, can make one more change if he wants to,
[4843.52 - 4847.12] P:1900.27 E:0.091218 |  and I'm sure he'll be talking to his coaching staff down there,
[4847.12 - 4848.96] P:1877.66 E:0.098256 |  and they'll be weighing up the fitness of all the players.
[4848.96 - 4850.40] P:1937.53 E:0.088091 |  They won't want to take a risk with anybody
[4850.40 - 4854.72] P:1870.05 E:0.070149 |  who's maybe not completely 100% fit, and Germany have a free kick.
[4854.72 - 4857.44] P:1811.17 E:0.082615 |  And that's why I would have said, go out there, just protect yourselves.
[4857.44 - 4860.00] P:1699.27 E:0.083822 |  Don't get injured, do things the simple way,
[4860.00 - 4863.44] P:1784.10 E:0.088505 |  don't overstretch him in any way, shape or form,
[4864.16 - 4867.60] P:1781.79 E:0.079976 |  and just go out and be sensible, even if you concede a goal.
[4867.60 - 4869.04] P:1900.18 E:0.085752 |  Don't concern yourselves.
[4869.04 - 4871.76] P:1833.65 E:0.075301 |  The most important thing for Germany now is the final.
[4871.76 - 4873.92] P:1945.16 E:0.098047 |  Well, this World Cup began with a Brazilian-owned goal,
[4873.92 - 4876.16] P:1962.75 E:0.086718 |  which is turning out to be quite symbolic now,
[4876.16 - 4878.88] P:1942.86 E:0.092567 |  because Marcelo put through his own goal against Croatia
[4878.88 - 4882.24] P:1855.51 E:0.083049 |  in the opening game, but then Neymar in particular got them back
[4882.24 - 4884.24] P:1908.40 E:0.088494 |  with two goals, 3-1 victory.
[4884.24 - 4887.12] P:1905.95 E:0.088779 |  They had a few lucky breaks as well along the way in that game.
[4887.92 - 4891.28] P:1746.25 E:0.087499 |  So, symbolically, this Brazilian World Cup began
[4891.28 - 4895.84] P:1860.99 E:0.081596 |  with a Brazilian-owned goal, and this is where it's going to end,
[4895.84 - 4898.72] P:1878.31 E:0.088929 |  in the stadium where it ended for England, of course, against Costa Rica.
[4898.72 - 4901.04] P:1912.48 E:0.093648 |  Long ball forward, very different circumstances, though.
[4901.84 - 4905.28] P:1902.18 E:0.081978 |  Again, Fred making a negligible contribution.
[4905.28 - 4907.68] P:1941.94 E:0.106718 |  Now, battles back, and he's still being booed by the fans here.
[4908.24 - 4912.48] P:1937.63 E:0.089638 |  Mike on down the right-hand side, into midfield, and Ramirez.
[4913.04 - 4915.76] P:1992.79 E:0.099949 |  Ramirez is just being hustled by Schweinsteiger there,
[4915.76 - 4917.36] P:1940.32 E:0.089993 |  as if it's still nil-nil.
[4917.36 - 4919.68] P:1958.50 E:0.094332 |  I mean, Schweinsteiger wasn't going to allow him to go through.
[4920.24 - 4921.04] P:1993.06 E:0.103334 |  Louise again.
[4921.92 - 4924.40] P:1952.08 E:0.096118 |  There'll be a lot of debate, too, I'm sure, about now.
[4924.40 - 4927.92] P:1906.58 E:0.092945 |  hindsight's a wonderful thing, whether all the right players were here for Brazil.
[4927.92 - 4932.48] P:1872.01 E:0.088848 |  Rebenio, for example, was left out, and people like Coutinho,
[4932.48 - 4933.92] P:1785.72 E:0.104792 |  Liverpool, when they were even near it.
[4934.48 - 4937.12] P:1948.25 E:0.099480 |  And now, Germany again, left-hand side.
[4937.12 - 4938.48] P:1917.30 E:0.098522 |  That's a fantastic ball.
[4938.48 - 4939.92] P:2005.70 E:0.097152 |  Schweinsteiger might have got it.
[4939.92 - 4941.20] P:2086.45 E:0.102170 |  Scherler might get it instead.
[4941.20 - 4945.12] P:2072.16 E:0.097054 |  Julio Cesar does well, comes out of his area, and Scherler shakes his fist.
[4945.12 - 4948.32] P:2027.95 E:0.088230 |  He thought he might have had a chance there of Germany's sixth goal,
[4948.32 - 4950.96] P:1941.30 E:0.091292 |  and Brazil now moving it down this left-hand side.
[4951.60 - 4953.68] P:1856.44 E:0.088098 |  At least from Brazil's point of view,
[4953.68 - 4956.00] P:1837.15 E:0.090903 |  there's been nothing more to stun them in this second half,
[4956.00 - 4958.72] P:1953.62 E:0.088106 |  as the ball is played into the penalty area.
[4958.72 - 4960.08] P:1844.33 E:0.086952 |  It won't come down for them.
[4960.08 - 4962.32] P:1950.61 E:0.095419 |  Now it's lifted in, Murdersack is header,
[4962.32 - 4964.56] P:1930.99 E:0.102658 |  and there's a flag up over on the far side.
[4965.28 - 4966.96] P:1881.97 E:0.103209 |  So the bicycle kick was in vain.
[4967.76 - 4969.76] P:1909.96 E:0.096927 |  The bicycle kick came from Paulinho,
[4970.72 - 4972.88] P:1957.19 E:0.094072 |  and it's going to be a free kick to Germany.
[4973.84 - 4978.56] P:1822.42 E:0.075788 |  And, well, it's not quite the halfway point of the second half,
[4978.56 - 4980.80] P:1870.51 E:0.091334 |  but I think it's actually quite a good moment,
[4980.80 - 4982.72] P:1817.91 E:0.082590 |  as there's a break in play here.
[4983.28 - 4984.72] P:1793.55 E:0.092261 |  I wonder whether Ney and Dennis
[4984.72 - 4986.88] P:1862.00 E:0.091545 |  is going to describe a record defeat for Brazil.
[4986.88 - 4990.80] P:1852.27 E:0.089387 |  Remember, 6-0 is that record scoreline in 1920.
[4990.80 - 4992.08] P:1872.59 E:0.081684 |  Over to you, Ian.
[4992.08 - 4996.08] P:1876.95 E:0.090985 |  I've worked quite closely with Mike over the last five years, covering England,
[4996.08 - 4998.40] P:1902.85 E:0.098162 |  and over the last five years, I've been quite reliant on him.
[4998.96 - 5001.20] P:1752.69 E:0.088501 |  And I'm going to have to ask for one last favour.
[5001.28 - 5002.48] P:1848.04 E:0.093192 |  Could I borrow your stopwatch?
[5002.48 - 5004.64] P:1827.96 E:0.093379 |  Because mine is a little bit like the Brazilian defence.
[5004.64 - 5005.84] P:1973.60 E:0.088921 |  It's stopped working.
[5006.96 - 5009.20] P:1921.90 E:0.087830 |  Thank you, Mike, and not just for the stopwatch.
[5011.44 - 5013.36] P:2049.34 E:0.108673 |  If you want to interact,
[5013.36 - 5017.12] P:1923.18 E:0.097048 |  then we're more than welcome to receive your texts and tweets here on 5 Live,
[5017.12 - 5018.24] P:1980.40 E:0.082855 |  your World Cup station.
[5018.24 - 5021.04] P:1862.40 E:0.088302 |  We do try and pride ourselves on being interactive.
[5021.52 - 5024.08] P:1900.57 E:0.088012 |  Here are a couple, not who have gone into 5 Live,
[5024.08 - 5027.20] P:1989.06 E:0.088296 |  but Josie Altador, all jokes aside, this is crazy.
[5027.20 - 5029.12] P:1849.79 E:0.084041 |  Hope Brazil can get a couple back.
[5029.12 - 5031.76] P:1956.10 E:0.087650 |  Hate to see the host nation go down like this.
[5031.76 - 5032.64] P:1922.38 E:0.097781 |  And Piers Morgan.
[5034.16 - 5036.72] P:1872.26 E:0.097037 |  And I'll pre-empt this by saying I'll make no other comment
[5036.72 - 5038.24] P:1857.33 E:0.082488 |  once I've read out his tweet.
[5038.24 - 5040.32] P:1897.06 E:0.092745 |  I'd back Brazil to win, Fred to score,
[5040.32 - 5042.72] P:1883.08 E:0.079742 |  and declared Louis my man of a tournament.
[5042.72 - 5044.80] P:1867.41 E:0.079335 |  I feel a complete and utter prat.
[5046.08 - 5049.92] P:1871.90 E:0.087792 |  5 Live, we're with you here until the end of this game.
[5050.48 - 5054.24] P:1889.51 E:0.090313 |  And when we were last here, of course, it was a complete dead rubber.
[5055.60 - 5057.68] P:1924.69 E:0.095205 |  England against Costa Rica.
[5057.76 - 5059.52] P:1854.41 E:0.087249 |  England were already going out.
[5059.52 - 5061.36] P:1895.36 E:0.094830 |  And ever since that fifth goal's gone in,
[5061.36 - 5065.04] P:1763.28 E:0.091751 |  we've had another hour of another dead rubber in Belo Horizonte.
[5065.04 - 5066.88] P:1828.24 E:0.092480 |  But even England's defence was better than this.
[5067.84 - 5068.64] P:1842.50 E:0.112492 |  I'm not sure...
[5068.64 - 5070.56] P:1851.20 E:0.086306 |  Well, they might have been beaten fire by Germany,
[5070.56 - 5072.32] P:1862.93 E:0.098239 |  but certainly probably not in the first 30 minutes.
[5073.52 - 5075.36] P:1765.29 E:0.097258 |  Here is Laam for Germany.
[5075.36 - 5076.24] P:1725.71 E:0.092271 |  Red and Hoopt.
[5077.04 - 5079.12] P:1898.25 E:0.094606 |  Red and Black Hoopt strike shirts.
[5079.12 - 5080.40] P:1938.29 E:0.103976 |  Laam into the penalty area.
[5080.40 - 5081.52] P:2023.28 E:0.107542 |  Low ball, pulsing.
[5082.40 - 5084.00] P:1998.77 E:0.112521 |  There is the goal from Scherler.
[5084.64 - 5090.32] P:2049.26 E:0.099735 |  And it is a record-equalling defeat for Brazil since 94 years.
[5091.12 - 5092.00] P:2076.40 E:0.118701 |  Brazil nil.
[5092.64 - 5094.00] P:2056.91 E:0.091412 |  Germany six.
[5094.72 - 5097.84] P:2011.24 E:0.092028 |  It is a night nobody will ever forget.
[5098.80 - 5099.92] P:1922.64 E:0.072331 |  Frightening.
[5099.92 - 5102.16] P:1909.96 E:0.102032 |  Knife through hot butter, doesn't even describe it.
[5102.16 - 5104.56] P:1923.25 E:0.103008 |  You can now hear all the fans around the stadium,
[5104.56 - 5106.80] P:1903.09 E:0.105718 |  every single one of them booing.
[5106.80 - 5108.96] P:1954.57 E:0.100061 |  They are absolutely outraged.
[5108.96 - 5113.52] P:1952.91 E:0.096694 |  There was four defensive players in and around Scherler,
[5113.52 - 5114.72] P:1948.45 E:0.085301 |  and he just went, no.
[5116.32 - 5120.48] P:1939.03 E:0.100818 |  Well, there's been pockets of descent during the second half.
[5121.04 - 5123.84] P:1970.43 E:0.100629 |  The stewards in their luminous orange and yellow jackets
[5123.84 - 5126.48] P:2001.40 E:0.090292 |  have had to intervene on two or three occasions.
[5127.20 - 5130.24] P:2012.67 E:0.099730 |  There was sporadic fighting high up a way to our right,
[5130.24 - 5132.48] P:2002.49 E:0.087748 |  which was quickly nipped in the bud.
[5133.12 - 5137.28] P:2009.50 E:0.092166 |  But I do fear that it is going to turn and continue to turn sour.
[5138.24 - 5140.48] P:1991.65 E:0.096738 |  Because, William is on for Brazil.
[5141.04 - 5146.40] P:1911.00 E:0.085874 |  Germany's record world-cut win, by the way, was against Saudi Arabia
[5146.40 - 5148.32] P:1993.82 E:0.093519 |  in the group stages of 2002.
[5148.32 - 5149.28] P:1891.51 E:0.084332 |  That was eight nil.
[5150.24 - 5151.20] P:1896.06 E:0.099549 |  It is six nil.
[5152.16 - 5156.48] P:1783.40 E:0.089990 |  It is an unbelievable score line,
[5156.48 - 5159.04] P:1947.10 E:0.097480 |  and will send shockwaves throughout world football.
[5160.56 - 5163.76] P:1928.20 E:0.097336 |  Brazil totally and utterly humiliated.
[5164.64 - 5167.28] P:1757.80 E:0.088213 |  Paulinho, to their credit, you know,
[5167.28 - 5170.32] P:2014.38 E:0.099916 |  there are still so many yellow shirts inside this stadium.
[5170.64 - 5173.20] P:1986.94 E:0.094657 |  That holds just under 57,500.
[5175.04 - 5177.84] P:1947.95 E:0.095683 |  Call me fickle, but I'd have gone a long time by now.
[5178.40 - 5179.52] P:1867.51 E:0.086726 |  Floated over.
[5179.52 - 5182.80] P:1961.83 E:0.089186 |  Brazil looking for the consolation,
[5182.80 - 5186.72] P:1986.00 E:0.094449 |  and it was Marcelo who has been exposed time and time again.
[5186.72 - 5190.00] P:1970.22 E:0.089522 |  And Arsene Vanguino, who's commentating for French TV,
[5190.00 - 5193.44] P:1907.59 E:0.091353 |  said these Brazilian players will be traumatised for life.
[5197.92 - 5199.68] P:1890.40 E:0.104123 |  And Germany coming forward.
[5199.68 - 5200.32] P:2019.04 E:0.096798 |  Kadeira.
[5201.12 - 5202.64] P:1904.76 E:0.108793 |  Erzal over on that far side.
[5203.20 - 5204.16] P:2075.14 E:0.111570 |  Scherler again.
[5204.16 - 5205.44] P:1961.11 E:0.095383 |  Sorry, it would cross this time.
[5205.44 - 5207.44] P:1912.17 E:0.076960 |  It got round the back of Marcelo.
[5207.44 - 5210.64] P:1914.31 E:0.085193 |  They are incredibly open still at the back.
[5210.64 - 5211.60] P:1854.23 E:0.080498 |  They've given up.
[5211.60 - 5213.76] P:1884.32 E:0.095987 |  We've just seen a very dejective thread on the sideline.
[5213.76 - 5216.32] P:1890.51 E:0.093322 |  He was taken off for William coming on,
[5216.32 - 5218.88] P:1982.24 E:0.084339 |  and they purely to save him from any more embarrassment.
[5218.88 - 5220.56] P:1982.22 E:0.076494 |  Every time he touched the ball,
[5220.56 - 5222.32] P:2002.26 E:0.082163 |  he was getting massive cheers and booze,
[5222.32 - 5224.80] P:1949.86 E:0.073469 |  and I think Scolari said, you know, that's not nice.
[5224.80 - 5226.00] P:1874.44 E:0.103279 |  The only way to sum it up, I think,
[5226.00 - 5229.20] P:1850.82 E:0.078552 |  and I think Mike said it earlier, it's actually quite sad.
[5230.64 - 5232.08] P:1795.42 E:0.086513 |  Here is William.
[5232.08 - 5233.84] P:1986.00 E:0.095177 |  We'll get the thoughts of Tim Vickeringer moment.
[5233.84 - 5236.40] P:2029.55 E:0.090714 |  William, who's a substitute, goes for a curling effort.
[5236.96 - 5241.20] P:1956.58 E:0.097479 |  Tim, 1920, was the last time that Brazil suffered a 6-0 defeat
[5241.20 - 5242.56] P:1982.83 E:0.085110 |  against Uruguay.
[5242.56 - 5243.36] P:1880.03 E:0.083885 |  Your thoughts, please.
[5244.72 - 5246.40] P:1669.78 E:0.099675 |  Very, very sad for these players.
[5246.40 - 5249.68] P:1717.87 E:0.093677 |  There'll be an orgy of self-hatred now over the next few days.
[5249.68 - 5251.76] P:1647.39 E:0.095678 |  Remember, this team will have to play again on Saturday.
[5252.32 - 5256.24] P:1892.51 E:0.097060 |  Straight afterwards, next week, the Brazilian championship resumes.
[5256.24 - 5259.28] P:1572.02 E:0.094165 |  So the focus will be back on club football very, very soon.
[5259.76 - 5262.72] P:1550.28 E:0.093026 |  I hope that doesn't mean that Brazilian football just looks at it,
[5262.72 - 5264.56] P:1755.93 E:0.074822 |  it stares at its own belly button.
[5264.56 - 5267.84] P:1734.94 E:0.084603 |  I hope that this defeat will have wide-ranging effects
[5267.84 - 5270.08] P:1655.20 E:0.087565 |  because Brazilian football is operating ludicrously
[5270.08 - 5270.96] P:1684.61 E:0.065815 |  below its potential.
[5272.08 - 5274.56] P:1878.92 E:0.081304 |  Well, nobody, of course, ever wants to play
[5274.56 - 5276.08] P:2047.84 E:0.091211 |  in a third-fourth-place playoff
[5276.08 - 5278.08] P:1834.96 E:0.081973 |  after the disappointment of losing the semi-final.
[5278.88 - 5280.72] P:1877.81 E:0.097624 |  But will any Brazilians turn up for that?
[5281.68 - 5283.28] P:1874.35 E:0.092041 |  That would be my question.
[5283.28 - 5287.28] P:1990.68 E:0.093485 |  I think they'll be so disenchanted with their team, so despondent.
[5287.84 - 5289.76] P:1899.01 E:0.099292 |  You can hear the booze ringing round at the moment.
[5290.48 - 5293.04] P:1938.27 E:0.099359 |  I'm not sure that, even those with tickets might go, you know what,
[5293.60 - 5296.00] P:1902.08 E:0.095174 |  it was so embarrassing to play, don't deserve our support.
[5296.64 - 5298.80] P:1967.34 E:0.093610 |  Here is Murtisaka to Scherler.
[5298.80 - 5300.56] P:1960.40 E:0.089276 |  You can only admire the Germans, by the way.
[5300.56 - 5303.36] P:1933.17 E:0.082227 |  I know a lot of the focus has been on Brazil
[5303.36 - 5305.52] P:1868.89 E:0.091052 |  and quite rightly so with the scoreline, maybe,
[5306.08 - 5308.96] P:1941.61 E:0.077488 |  because it is totally astonishing.
[5308.96 - 5312.80] P:1921.81 E:0.072393 |  But the Germans have been fantastic.
[5312.80 - 5314.56] P:1935.95 E:0.089879 |  They're into an eighth World Cup final.
[5315.12 - 5316.48] P:1896.80 E:0.096485 |  And you look at their record,
[5318.00 - 5322.16] P:1968.61 E:0.097267 |  since Euro 2004, when they failed to get out of the group stages,
[5323.44 - 5327.92] P:1910.94 E:0.093591 |  and they failed to reach the last four of a World Cup or Euro since.
[5329.12 - 5333.12] P:1990.39 E:0.095097 |  I know it's 18 years since they last won a major tournament, Euro 96.
[5334.16 - 5337.52] P:1980.98 E:0.083255 |  But for tournament football, Rafa Honegstein,
[5338.24 - 5339.44] P:1924.31 E:0.096428 |  it's an incredible record.
[5340.00 - 5342.88] P:1949.03 E:0.086232 |  And one, there's some more fighting, I think he's just breaking out
[5342.88 - 5344.88] P:2004.31 E:0.100348 |  on that right-hand side, the stewards are getting involved.
[5345.60 - 5349.84] P:1976.15 E:0.091308 |  Rafa, you'll never have a better opportunity to end that 18-year wait.
[5352.00 - 5356.08] P:1751.36 E:0.090972 |  That is true, although with every goal, Germany's score here,
[5356.08 - 5358.32] P:1688.29 E:0.071814 |  the pressure just becomes bigger on them.
[5358.32 - 5362.72] P:1586.20 E:0.092718 |  After Nervy 1-0 or 2-1 after penalties or that sort of result,
[5364.48 - 5366.80] P:1544.68 E:0.109612 |  you wouldn't have necessarily such a clear favourite.
[5366.80 - 5368.88] P:1379.57 E:0.099802 |  Now, whatever Argentina and Netherlands will do,
[5368.88 - 5372.00] P:1608.91 E:0.087167 |  Germany will go in this game with a feeling that they've
[5372.88 - 5373.92] P:1220.66 E:0.099471 |  only can throw it away.
[5373.92 - 5375.12] P:1362.55 E:0.087832 |  And I think that's very dangerous.
[5375.12 - 5377.12] P:1565.86 E:0.097490 |  I mean, maybe I'm being a bit a little bit too German,
[5377.12 - 5380.64] P:1569.15 E:0.088662 |  you're seeing already the negatives after a 6-0 win against Brazil.
[5381.44 - 5383.52] P:1605.69 E:0.092084 |  But of course, it does increase the pressure on Nervy.
[5383.52 - 5386.16] P:1685.84 E:0.077070 |  And it'll be a nice result to remember,
[5386.16 - 5389.60] P:1682.18 E:0.079916 |  but it'll count for very, very little if they don't win the World Cup.
[5389.60 - 5390.88] P:1611.40 E:0.089733 |  And that is a serious point.
[5392.80 - 5396.40] P:1919.17 E:0.089280 |  Well, the one thing that they do have in their favour is huge experience.
[5397.36 - 5400.48] P:1902.82 E:0.091227 |  Tally of the Brazilian starting line-up was 406 caps.
[5401.04 - 5404.56] P:1854.70 E:0.088643 |  Brazil with Laam, Schweinsteiger and Kloser,
[5404.56 - 5407.04] P:1938.76 E:0.091185 |  3 centurions was 352.
[5407.04 - 5409.76] P:1847.15 E:0.076739 |  Kroos has scored a couple of goals,
[5409.76 - 5413.20] P:1880.97 E:0.088926 |  is actually making his 50th appearance tonight for his country.
[5413.20 - 5417.44] P:1883.95 E:0.083918 |  And with that, there's actually another five players with 50 or more caps.
[5417.44 - 5422.32] P:1906.11 E:0.082851 |  This is a German squad that has so much experience.
[5422.32 - 5426.08] P:1913.49 E:0.083884 |  And I remember being in Sweden when they beat England
[5426.72 - 5430.48] P:1975.57 E:0.092138 |  England in the under-21 championships by four goals to nil.
[5431.12 - 5436.00] P:1980.77 E:0.084167 |  And six of those players are in this squad here for World Cup 2014.
[5436.88 - 5439.44] P:1904.26 E:0.092232 |  And one of England's gripes is about player progression.
[5440.56 - 5444.80] P:1870.34 E:0.089058 |  On that night in Malmo, England had Martin Craney and Michael Mansion.
[5444.80 - 5446.00] P:1883.26 E:0.078774 |  Where are they now?
[5446.00 - 5447.68] P:1936.98 E:0.091603 |  We know where the Germans are.
[5447.68 - 5451.92] P:1928.34 E:0.086035 |  They're romping their way through to the World Cup final of American art,
[5452.72 - 5454.56] P:1947.65 E:0.087885 |  with 15 minutes remaining.
[5454.64 - 5461.28] P:1955.11 E:0.078801 |  Germany are leading by six goals to nil against the host nation,
[5462.08 - 5467.60] P:1890.09 E:0.079387 |  who have suffered their heaviest defeat since 1920.
[5467.60 - 5468.96] P:1919.22 E:0.091549 |  So 94 years.
[5469.92 - 5470.88] P:1807.18 E:0.090239 |  Oh, this is going to hurt.
[5473.12 - 5478.16] P:2069.99 E:0.102506 |  They wanted to so exercise the ghosts of 1950 and losing the final to Uruguay.
[5480.08 - 5481.84] P:1875.02 E:0.068321 |  Well, not going to happen.
[5482.40 - 5486.08] P:1896.74 E:0.072385 |  It's going to be a night that will haunt them,
[5486.08 - 5489.92] P:1961.99 E:0.092924 |  a new generation of Brazilian supporters for many, many years to come.
[5492.96 - 5497.20] P:1876.32 E:0.084301 |  Here is Louise flicking the ball over the head of Schweinsteiger.
[5497.20 - 5499.76] P:2010.52 E:0.101448 |  Schweinsteiger recovers, brings him down free kick.
[5499.76 - 5500.96] P:1941.07 E:0.083053 |  Germany are going to make a change.
[5500.96 - 5501.76] P:2075.19 E:0.094211 |  Jenny Mills.
[5502.56 - 5505.52] P:1972.59 E:0.072708 |  Well, I think Germany now just going to see the game out.
[5505.52 - 5509.28] P:1900.53 E:0.081164 |  You said the substitutes about to be made is actually Schweinsteiger.
[5509.28 - 5512.24] P:1854.89 E:0.086441 |  It's actually Schweinsteiger that's going to come off.
[5512.24 - 5514.72] P:1934.95 E:0.091930 |  I just listened to you talk about those statistics.
[5514.72 - 5518.88] P:1884.52 E:0.078575 |  Now, you stopped counting up to three or three players adding up those numbers.
[5518.88 - 5523.44] P:1832.21 E:0.079607 |  719 caps, I think Germany started with at the beginning of this game,
[5523.44 - 5525.36] P:1812.00 E:0.084109 |  compared to Brazil's 406.
[5526.08 - 5529.84] P:1940.89 E:0.090224 |  The experience that they have, and the average age of the players now,
[5529.84 - 5534.88] P:1884.46 E:0.083755 |  at around about 24, 25, all these players are just about hitting their peak.
[5534.88 - 5539.20] P:1888.47 E:0.080388 |  And just to wrap you honestly, I think the disappointment now will be from Germany.
[5539.52 - 5543.20] P:1873.78 E:0.092954 |  If they don't want to win this, because these players, they are in their prime.
[5543.20 - 5546.56] P:1911.36 E:0.085562 |  They've proved, you know, at their clubs, they are exceptional.
[5546.56 - 5551.44] P:1788.85 E:0.084205 |  They've now proved here this evening that they are worthy winners of a World Cup.
[5551.44 - 5553.76] P:1861.20 E:0.078239 |  Now, they've got to go out and prove it.
[5553.76 - 5556.00] P:1973.83 E:0.095061 |  I was fluttered earlier to be called your glamorous assistant,
[5556.00 - 5557.52] P:1802.66 E:0.087226 |  but maths has never been my strong point.
[5557.52 - 5559.52] P:1930.69 E:0.088710 |  That's why I stopped at 352.
[5559.52 - 5562.80] P:1912.64 E:0.097217 |  Although your Portuguese, I have to say, has been very, very good
[5562.80 - 5565.12] P:1829.64 E:0.075805 |  and has been well worked on this trip,
[5565.12 - 5567.76] P:1912.95 E:0.092561 |  has saved us on more than one occasion, getting us into a restaurant.
[5568.72 - 5569.76] P:1817.51 E:0.081870 |  I have my uses.
[5569.76 - 5572.16] P:1911.04 E:0.102613 |  Julian Draxler is on for Samir Kedira.
[5572.16 - 5577.04] P:1920.19 E:0.075210 |  It's his first appearance of this tournament, the Schalke player.
[5577.04 - 5579.84] P:1994.86 E:0.076395 |  It's his 12th appearance for his country.
[5580.72 - 5582.24] P:1945.92 E:0.097006 |  Lula has just been told to get away.
[5582.24 - 5585.84] P:1955.65 E:0.088009 |  I think there was a wild swing by Luiz that he reacted to.
[5587.36 - 5589.04] P:1936.01 E:0.087810 |  I asked for your texts and tweets.
[5591.04 - 5594.00] P:1934.92 E:0.084810 |  Upbeat Trick has sent Germany proving to the world.
[5594.00 - 5595.12] P:1887.82 E:0.088656 |  Brazil just aren't very good.
[5595.20 - 5599.60] P:1896.31 E:0.081435 |  It's a well-oiled German machine tearing up a rusty shell-shot Brazil.
[5599.60 - 5601.04] P:1889.17 E:0.086655 |  Adam Carter, 1985.
[5601.04 - 5602.72] P:1852.44 E:0.088225 |  OK, this is humiliating for Brazil.
[5602.72 - 5604.08] P:1700.29 E:0.072302 |  Unbelievable, incredible.
[5604.08 - 5605.52] P:1789.51 E:0.088019 |  And Hamnest, take Neuer off.
[5605.52 - 5606.48] P:1855.59 E:0.078401 |  He could do with the rest.
[5606.48 - 5607.76] P:1957.62 E:0.054729 |  Football justice.
[5607.76 - 5608.96] P:1828.88 E:0.095027 |  The worst Brazil side ever.
[5608.96 - 5610.80] P:1677.40 E:0.076709 |  This was coming not 5-0, though.
[5610.80 - 5614.32] P:1692.99 E:0.072729 |  Well, if you missed it, since that was sent, they've added another.
[5615.20 - 5618.56] P:1995.08 E:0.097423 |  6-0, 5-live, your World Cup station in 2014.
[5619.28 - 5622.72] P:1856.65 E:0.095607 |  Tomorrow night, Sao Paulo, the two-hour build-up to Argentina
[5622.72 - 5623.44] P:1906.56 E:0.093021 |  against Holland.
[5623.44 - 5625.92] P:1801.07 E:0.077446 |  It certainly will not be as one-sided as this.
[5625.92 - 5628.80] P:1910.69 E:0.083025 |  And then Sunday's final in the Maracanar at 8.
[5628.80 - 5631.92] P:1901.58 E:0.088737 |  And do not forget to miss my King and the World Cup years.
[5632.80 - 5633.68] P:1879.56 E:0.106150 |  Friday at 9.
[5633.68 - 5635.20] P:1825.30 E:0.084680 |  And Sunday repeated at 1.
[5635.20 - 5639.84] P:1789.21 E:0.072503 |  Looking back on his 8th World Cup tournament.
[5642.64 - 5644.00] P:2050.47 E:0.103797 |  Have I dropped a faux pas?
[5644.00 - 5645.60] P:1988.72 E:0.096048 |  I think he said, do not forget to miss.
[5645.60 - 5646.08] P:2067.13 E:0.119826 |  Oh, do not.
[5648.32 - 5650.64] P:1870.90 E:0.108700 |  It's been a long tournament, but don't worry, I'm going home tomorrow.
[5651.04 - 5653.28] P:1878.67 E:0.078165 |  He'll give me another kick under the table.
[5653.28 - 5654.88] P:1723.19 E:0.098773 |  I've had a few of those on this tournament.
[5654.88 - 5657.28] P:1901.25 E:0.091240 |  I've had a few over the last five years, to be fair, from Mike.
[5657.28 - 5659.60] P:1849.42 E:0.084815 |  Don't forget to listen to Mike's World Cup years.
[5659.60 - 5660.56] P:1914.89 E:0.100850 |  That's what I meant.
[5660.56 - 5661.36] P:1848.46 E:0.089838 |  I think that's what we need to say.
[5661.36 - 5662.56] P:1838.70 E:0.078967 |  I'm shell shot like the rest of them.
[5662.56 - 5663.44] P:1893.23 E:0.073615 |  I'm not Brazilian.
[5664.48 - 5666.64] P:1780.79 E:0.077048 |  Anyway, you got the drift.
[5666.64 - 5670.24] P:1862.44 E:0.087728 |  I think the German fans are actually genuinely shocked as well.
[5674.72 - 5678.48] P:1980.17 E:0.093786 |  Scherler has added a second for himself.
[5680.72 - 5683.44] P:2088.30 E:0.100932 |  And now Germany have scored seven.
[5683.44 - 5687.12] P:2061.31 E:0.092929 |  And it is the heaviest defeat in Brazil's history.
[5687.68 - 5689.84] P:2056.18 E:0.101936 |  Brazil's illustrious history.
[5690.64 - 5694.96] P:2105.97 E:0.096693 |  And the herd continues on a night when the nation of Brazil
[5694.96 - 5696.64] P:2156.55 E:0.101936 |  is totally humiliated.
[5697.36 - 5699.28] P:2084.83 E:0.102964 |  It is a complete another night there.
[5699.92 - 5703.52] P:2137.17 E:0.096914 |  And it is a scoreline which the Germans cannot believe.
[5703.52 - 5705.68] P:2161.64 E:0.100894 |  And the Brazilians cannot believe.
[5706.24 - 5707.12] P:2070.25 E:0.110183 |  Brazil, nil.
[5708.40 - 5709.84] P:2111.51 E:0.096369 |  Germany, seven.
[5710.40 - 5713.76] P:2146.32 E:0.096186 |  And Andre Scherler with a left-footed shot
[5713.76 - 5715.60] P:2062.36 E:0.096355 |  in off the underside of the crossbar.
[5716.40 - 5717.92] P:1981.30 E:0.092751 |  What a fantastic strike.
[5717.92 - 5720.80] P:2006.89 E:0.084322 |  It was just lobbed back in to the edge of the box.
[5720.80 - 5725.76] P:1985.38 E:0.081378 |  He was running through, took it, smashed it in at the near post.
[5725.76 - 5726.40] P:1695.24 E:0.096091 |  On off the other side.
[5727.04 - 5729.28] P:1896.59 E:0.095797 |  U-Laces are absolutely no chance.
[5729.28 - 5730.48] P:1768.49 E:0.082582 |  The Brazilians are giving up on him.
[5730.48 - 5732.72] P:1895.19 E:0.086937 |  David Luiz couldn't chase him anymore.
[5732.72 - 5736.16] P:1820.68 E:0.089052 |  And the celebrations were almost apologetic.
[5736.16 - 5739.44] P:1916.12 E:0.088250 |  Even the German fans were shaking their heads
[5739.44 - 5741.20] P:1814.02 E:0.081338 |  going, is this real?
[5741.76 - 5743.84] P:1850.98 E:0.078540 |  You know, euphoric for them.
[5743.84 - 5747.28] P:1921.31 E:0.086607 |  But they should, no one in their wildest dreams.
[5747.28 - 5750.00] P:1785.36 E:0.085413 |  I don't think would have put a bet on Germany winning by
[5751.04 - 5754.16] P:1888.30 E:0.089641 |  three clear goals, four clear goals at the very, very most.
[5754.88 - 5759.36] P:1928.11 E:0.080973 |  Seven, just, well, we are literally speechless.
[5760.00 - 5762.64] P:1935.87 E:0.091401 |  Well, now they're heading for the exits of the Brazilians supporters.
[5763.92 - 5765.84] P:1987.02 E:0.093776 |  I was slow to pick up the goal
[5765.84 - 5768.88] P:1992.67 E:0.082994 |  because I'd actually just been handed a note
[5768.96 - 5771.52] P:1988.87 E:0.089194 |  which said the biggest World Cup semi-finals wins.
[5771.52 - 5773.84] P:2006.80 E:0.094536 |  Well, it now eclipses all of these previous score lines
[5773.84 - 5776.56] P:1952.95 E:0.084206 |  that are going to give you because this is the biggest margin
[5776.56 - 5778.32] P:1922.69 E:0.080436 |  in a World Cup semi-final.
[5778.32 - 5780.80] P:2001.12 E:0.089399 |  Eclipsing Argentina sixth, the United States one,
[5780.80 - 5783.68] P:1935.14 E:0.086276 |  and Uruguay sixth, Yugoslavia one in 1930.
[5783.68 - 5787.76] P:1996.33 E:0.087053 |  And West Germany sixth, one victory against Austria in 1954.
[5788.64 - 5791.76] P:1953.73 E:0.094038 |  Shot comes in from Marcelo on the edge of the area.
[5791.76 - 5792.40] P:1929.01 E:0.096295 |  That's wide.
[5792.96 - 5795.76] P:1989.69 E:0.082142 |  Seven, seven nil to Germany.
[5796.32 - 5799.36] P:2007.10 E:0.086138 |  And we have still 10 more minutes remaining.
[5799.36 - 5802.88] P:2016.69 E:0.083582 |  They might well yet equal their record win
[5802.88 - 5806.56] P:2010.62 E:0.082854 |  in a World Cup for Germans against Saudi Arabia that was eight nil.
[5808.08 - 5810.16] P:1955.10 E:0.090270 |  The record continues to be broken.
[5810.16 - 5811.28] P:2033.14 E:0.102514 |  Miroslav closer.
[5812.24 - 5816.08] P:2018.98 E:0.100773 |  Beating Ronaldo's record, the all-time leading scorer now in the World Cup.
[5816.64 - 5820.80] P:1963.62 E:0.084626 |  Brazil, the heaviest defeat in their entire history.
[5820.80 - 5822.40] P:1953.03 E:0.095784 |  That is remarkable in itself.
[5826.48 - 5827.84] P:1764.59 E:0.118844 |  You're almost, well, we are.
[5827.84 - 5829.04] P:1815.85 E:0.099711 |  I really don't know what to say anymore.
[5830.48 - 5831.36] P:1782.91 E:0.087986 |  It's seven nil.
[5832.72 - 5834.08] P:1905.50 E:0.096394 |  Brazil starts the OK.
[5834.08 - 5836.72] P:1862.12 E:0.072303 |  Germany have been exceptional.
[5837.60 - 5842.00] P:1873.49 E:0.079111 |  You know, they weathered the storm for that 15, 10, 15-minute spell.
[5842.96 - 5848.56] P:1867.70 E:0.077632 |  And then they have just been so efficient, so clinical in their play.
[5849.60 - 5850.72] P:1833.40 E:0.092638 |  You know, it really has been...
[5850.72 - 5853.04] P:1890.02 E:0.089750 |  We've concentrated a lot on Brazil
[5853.04 - 5855.84] P:1831.76 E:0.081209 |  and how awful they've been, especially defensively.
[5855.84 - 5857.04] P:1842.59 E:0.078609 |  They've been absolutely shocking.
[5857.04 - 5859.28] P:1817.33 E:0.079097 |  They're complete shambles at times.
[5860.08 - 5862.24] P:1907.87 E:0.083446 |  Germany have just controlled this.
[5862.24 - 5865.20] P:1898.59 E:0.084339 |  Since they went two nil up, it then became men...
[5866.64 - 5868.40] P:1863.60 E:0.090869 |  Not even as boys against infants.
[5869.04 - 5870.00] P:1909.82 E:0.086097 |  It's been that easy for them.
[5870.00 - 5873.04] P:1981.50 E:0.105459 |  The Brazilians are actually allaying the Germans now.
[5873.04 - 5876.80] P:1975.23 E:0.093269 |  The Brazilian support are allaying Germany football
[5876.80 - 5879.12] P:1979.12 E:0.091738 |  as they're keeping the ball and coming forward.
[5880.16 - 5882.16] P:1990.47 E:0.096041 |  It can't get much worse.
[5882.72 - 5887.12] P:1973.32 E:0.092007 |  This humiliation, this abject humiliation for Brazil.
[5887.12 - 5890.08] P:2024.20 E:0.096304 |  Their own supporters are allaying the opposition
[5890.72 - 5893.12] P:1959.97 E:0.090905 |  who are leading by seven goals to nil.
[5893.68 - 5897.04] P:1958.38 E:0.089387 |  For a footballing sense, I remember being at St. James's Park
[5897.04 - 5902.00] P:1952.16 E:0.084378 |  where Newcastle scored eight, seven or eight against Spurs.
[5902.00 - 5905.84] P:1982.08 E:0.084024 |  I remember Kevin Keegan feeling for Jerry Francis after the game.
[5905.84 - 5907.12] P:1812.06 E:0.089694 |  I didn't enjoy it after a while.
[5908.08 - 5909.92] P:1953.79 E:0.093910 |  He felt for his opposite number.
[5910.88 - 5913.60] P:2032.08 E:0.101615 |  I wonder if Joachim Lerb is feeling the same as well here
[5913.60 - 5917.12] P:2022.86 E:0.089473 |  because Germany with Scherler into the penalty area, cleared by Dante.
[5918.72 - 5920.00] P:1985.16 E:0.092434 |  I mentioned earlier in about...
[5920.64 - 5922.40] P:1853.81 E:0.075468 |  Put it in perspective.
[5923.28 - 5926.08] P:1874.73 E:0.085652 |  This is what England Moldova, five nil.
[5927.20 - 5929.12] P:1727.14 E:0.094592 |  England San Marino, I'm sure there's a seven nil.
[5930.72 - 5935.12] P:1871.07 E:0.078186 |  It's just absolutely staggering.
[5935.12 - 5938.08] P:1799.99 E:0.088136 |  I really cannot believe that it has got to this point.
[5938.64 - 5942.00] P:1823.76 E:0.083110 |  Brazil, Phil Scolari, still in the sideline now.
[5942.00 - 5942.80] P:1720.20 E:0.089444 |  Arms folded.
[5943.68 - 5947.44] P:1752.61 E:0.079985 |  Must be thinking, how on earth am I going to explain this
[5948.40 - 5952.88] P:1787.66 E:0.076545 |  to not just the Brazilian press, but the world press after this game.
[5952.88 - 5954.56] P:1975.57 E:0.100925 |  Will you hear the cliché trotted out?
[5954.56 - 5957.44] P:1865.65 E:0.081922 |  There are no easy games in its international football nowadays.
[5958.88 - 5959.60] P:1742.19 E:0.103756 |  Apart from this one.
[5959.60 - 5960.48] P:1707.00 E:0.084742 |  Apart from this one.
[5962.40 - 5965.76] P:1928.72 E:0.098386 |  We will certainly have a repeat of the previous final,
[5965.76 - 5967.76] P:1904.64 E:0.093628 |  whether it be 1990 in Argentina,
[5967.76 - 5970.16] P:1965.08 E:0.086053 |  or just West Germany winning that, of course, in Italy,
[5970.16 - 5974.64] P:1972.14 E:0.085757 |  or indeed the 74 final where the Germans beat Holland 2-1.
[5974.64 - 5978.08] P:1956.26 E:0.083172 |  Because tomorrow in Sao Paulo, Argentina against Holland,
[5978.08 - 5979.92] P:1938.69 E:0.092211 |  we've got six and a half minutes remaining,
[5981.28 - 5982.80] P:1888.60 E:0.092564 |  and Germany are coming forward.
[5982.80 - 5985.76] P:2018.71 E:0.095300 |  And this is Laam, and they've still got runners going on ahead of them.
[5985.76 - 5990.24] P:1989.59 E:0.083755 |  Scherler, who's on a hat-trick, cleared though by Gustavo towards Marcello.
[5992.08 - 5994.40] P:1909.10 E:0.088451 |  And Marcello will play it forward to William.
[5994.40 - 5995.44] P:1931.48 E:0.087683 |  They came with hopes.
[5995.44 - 5998.08] P:1956.39 E:0.092003 |  They came on a ride of emotion.
[5999.76 - 6001.12] P:1873.23 E:0.112724 |  This is why they're going.
[6001.12 - 6004.40] P:1963.49 E:0.084209 |  But they've been completely dismissed by the German efficiency
[6004.40 - 6006.08] P:1868.21 E:0.078463 |  and their own shambolic defending.
[6006.88 - 6010.72] P:1917.94 E:0.087045 |  Let's just about say, this might sound really odd, and maybe a bit daft,
[6010.72 - 6012.96] P:1836.90 E:0.083232 |  but Brazil have won this, sorry, Germany have won this,
[6013.68 - 6015.04] P:1771.77 E:0.078999 |  without trying that hard.
[6017.52 - 6019.20] P:1845.18 E:0.103231 |  Out towards that far side, Maicon.
[6019.20 - 6022.08] P:1807.59 E:0.087941 |  Maicon to Paulinho opens up his body, cleared away by Bote.
[6022.64 - 6026.96] P:1805.51 E:0.084536 |  Tomorrow we've got the first day of the first test starting at Trent Bridge.
[6026.96 - 6030.32] P:1903.26 E:0.080028 |  There'll be coverage on five live sports extra from 10-25.
[6031.36 - 6034.08] P:1950.75 E:0.095228 |  In quick as in parlance now, the Germans can easily declare,
[6035.44 - 6038.40] P:1942.36 E:0.075541 |  leading by seven goals to nil.
[6038.40 - 6040.88] P:1979.63 E:0.092148 |  Brazil are forward now, and this is with Ramirez.
[6040.88 - 6043.44] P:1964.94 E:0.081939 |  Ramirez will turn straight towards Neuer.
[6043.44 - 6044.48] P:1957.29 E:0.083799 |  They've not let up though.
[6044.48 - 6046.80] P:1982.62 E:0.084681 |  That's why you've got to admire the Germans.
[6046.80 - 6050.40] P:2002.29 E:0.094214 |  Even Neuer earlier in the second half, making those saves.
[6051.36 - 6053.84] P:1965.84 E:0.083840 |  They're not ease off the pedal at all.
[6053.84 - 6056.00] P:1794.25 E:0.074436 |  A lot of pride about the performance.
[6056.00 - 6057.60] P:1913.40 E:0.074295 |  They won't want to concede goals.
[6058.64 - 6061.20] P:1821.56 E:0.072761 |  They've taken it a little bit easy in the second half,
[6061.20 - 6062.72] P:1685.10 E:0.081717 |  but they've taken the whole game.
[6062.72 - 6068.24] P:1789.30 E:0.083109 |  They've played with such a swagger, such a confidence and an air of belief.
[6069.52 - 6073.44] P:1826.11 E:0.073553 |  And just sheer efficiency is what they've done.
[6073.44 - 6075.28] P:1715.31 E:0.093634 |  They haven't really had to work hard.
[6075.28 - 6077.44] P:1804.07 E:0.080698 |  They haven't had to go and close the Brazilians down.
[6077.52 - 6081.28] P:1742.14 E:0.079497 |  So once they got that second goal, that was it, game over.
[6081.28 - 6083.52] P:1829.82 E:0.075517 |  They've been in complete control ever since.
[6085.44 - 6090.56] P:1846.29 E:0.091042 |  Well, for Germany, they're unbeaten in their last 17 internationals now.
[6090.56 - 6092.64] P:1870.39 E:0.084619 |  They've won 12 and drawn five.
[6092.64 - 6097.36] P:1937.58 E:0.082297 |  They're going into the World Cup final in the American R on the crest of a way.
[6097.36 - 6099.12] P:1963.52 E:0.074711 |  Their confidence will be high.
[6099.12 - 6100.88] P:1971.16 E:0.089562 |  Raffer Honekstein back in studio.
[6103.04 - 6105.68] P:1665.61 E:0.104298 |  There will be incredible headlines tomorrow about the dream,
[6105.68 - 6112.80] P:1757.73 E:0.081706 |  about the miracle of a better horizon to about Germany having one and a half hands at the cup,
[6112.80 - 6117.04] P:1663.38 E:0.077790 |  if that's possibly an animosity possible.
[6118.48 - 6123.04] P:1661.14 E:0.094654 |  And they'll be waiting for whoever will be the underdog in that final.
[6123.04 - 6124.88] P:1646.97 E:0.091832 |  That will be the assumption in Germany.
[6124.88 - 6128.16] P:1738.41 E:0.082357 |  And Lerth will try his best to downplay everything.
[6128.16 - 6129.84] P:1415.78 E:0.105015 |  They'll say, you know, this is another game.
[6129.84 - 6130.88] P:1615.33 E:0.083160 |  We'll have to start again.
[6131.44 - 6133.52] P:1778.05 E:0.076789 |  We can't take anything for granted.
[6133.52 - 6136.40] P:1741.38 E:0.083633 |  But the players will go into this game with so much confidence.
[6136.40 - 6138.00] P:1765.88 E:0.096146 |  You know, they were shaky against Algeria.
[6138.00 - 6139.76] P:1672.10 E:0.083434 |  They were shaky against Ghana.
[6139.76 - 6144.48] P:1683.55 E:0.082427 |  But with the confidence that's come into their game, coupled with the ability,
[6145.04 - 6146.56] P:1733.63 E:0.072549 |  they look absolutely awesome today.
[6149.44 - 6152.24] P:1846.13 E:0.097164 |  Well, the thing is as well is that for Joachim Lerth,
[6153.28 - 6155.44] P:1905.37 E:0.076405 |  this is his fourth major finals.
[6155.44 - 6160.24] P:1890.20 E:0.091606 |  He's yet to taste the success and he wants to obviously change all that runner up in 2008.
[6161.20 - 6162.72] P:1933.36 E:0.097356 |  Third, of course, in South Africa.
[6163.60 - 6169.76] P:1860.10 E:0.080891 |  Beating Uruguay in that third, fourth place playoff and then semifinals in the 2012 Euros.
[6170.32 - 6172.32] P:1868.27 E:0.097907 |  All the headlines be back in Germany, Rapper.
[6174.16 - 6178.40] P:1654.95 E:0.089387 |  Well, it will be all about a result that nobody thought was possible.
[6179.12 - 6181.12] P:1623.94 E:0.090942 |  A result that we'll probably never see again.
[6181.12 - 6187.44] P:1643.94 E:0.086458 |  A seven-nil in the semifinal between the two of the best teams in World Football
[6187.44 - 6190.32] P:1670.31 E:0.088497 |  is something that I'm not sure we'll ever see again.
[6190.40 - 6195.60] P:1838.34 E:0.087943 |  To see a team fall apart and to see a team hit them with all they've got.
[6197.52 - 6201.36] P:2057.66 E:0.096447 |  The German supporters high up away to our right-hand side,
[6201.36 - 6203.04] P:2088.38 E:0.099558 |  a swaying from side to side.
[6203.60 - 6206.00] P:2084.32 E:0.102485 |  They're either bare-chested or wearing the white shirts.
[6206.64 - 6208.64] P:1969.10 E:0.086845 |  It's a night they will never forget.
[6208.64 - 6210.16] P:1849.83 E:0.086004 |  It's a night nobody will ever forget,
[6210.16 - 6213.60] P:1982.75 E:0.082873 |  whether you're actually inside the stadium of Belo Horizonte
[6213.60 - 6217.44] P:1945.65 E:0.089793 |  and it is far from a beautiful horizon as far as the Brazilians are concerned.
[6218.00 - 6220.32] P:1903.91 E:0.084007 |  Or indeed, from a German's point of view.
[6221.60 - 6224.48] P:1923.72 E:0.073663 |  Because they have been fantastic.
[6224.48 - 6225.68] P:1991.72 E:0.103070 |  Brazil have been awful.
[6227.20 - 6230.72] P:1887.88 E:0.092374 |  And we have two minutes of normal time remaining.
[6231.76 - 6234.08] P:1907.75 E:0.088136 |  And here is Merserzaka backpedaling.
[6235.04 - 6240.56] P:1897.86 E:0.085956 |  And Neuer, the sweeper keeper midway through the German half.
[6241.20 - 6242.56] P:1997.01 E:0.091387 |  Kroos forward.
[6244.24 - 6246.88] P:1945.61 E:0.100623 |  Just dropping to collect this ball is Julian Draxler.
[6247.68 - 6252.00] P:1930.16 E:0.089848 |  Playing the ball at walking pace, stroking it around, oozing with confidence.
[6254.16 - 6256.56] P:2004.26 E:0.098955 |  Erzal and finding the space as well.
[6256.56 - 6258.00] P:2100.56 E:0.099627 |  Laam towards Scherler.
[6258.00 - 6260.56] P:2009.05 E:0.077177 |  Louise will cover in fact, he'll leave it towards
[6260.56 - 6263.36] P:1919.06 E:0.094137 |  Julio Cesar, who throws it out underarm towards Marcelo.
[6264.88 - 6268.00] P:1985.80 E:0.100827 |  Not sure going to need your Portuguese tonight to get us a table at a restaurant.
[6268.56 - 6270.16] P:1859.92 E:0.089122 |  I think there might be plenty of spaces.
[6270.16 - 6272.00] P:1900.25 E:0.076977 |  There might be lots of empty tables.
[6272.00 - 6273.68] P:1938.57 E:0.098895 |  Offside trap is beaten by Oscar.
[6273.68 - 6275.28] P:1912.46 E:0.093370 |  Oscar across the face of goal.
[6275.28 - 6277.28] P:1919.29 E:0.087301 |  Won't even go out for a goal kick.
[6277.28 - 6278.88] P:1922.35 E:0.088906 |  He goes out of play for a throw.
[6278.88 - 6282.32] P:1905.21 E:0.084749 |  And there's a few more hoots of derision from the Brazilian supporters
[6282.32 - 6284.24] P:1878.94 E:0.083206 |  who have remained inside the stadium.
[6284.24 - 6288.56] P:2021.33 E:0.095314 |  And now here in Belo Horizonte, you can actually see those shades of
[6289.84 - 6292.72] P:1961.72 E:0.086586 |  degrees of grey of the bucket seats here.
[6293.44 - 6294.72] P:2020.23 E:0.100549 |  But it is not a grey night.
[6295.36 - 6298.32] P:1934.16 E:0.076527 |  It is a black night for Brazil.
[6299.92 - 6302.88] P:1941.11 E:0.085533 |  Seven-nil as a host nation.
[6302.88 - 6304.40] P:1870.35 E:0.096501 |  The worst thing is for them now.
[6304.40 - 6307.12] P:1883.95 E:0.077065 |  They've got to come out and play the third, fourth place playoff.
[6307.12 - 6310.00] P:1820.15 E:0.083135 |  You know, and that's going to be a horrible game for them to be involved in.
[6310.00 - 6310.88] P:1775.10 E:0.093565 |  Here is William.
[6311.68 - 6315.44] P:1888.79 E:0.101093 |  Shot comes in from Bernard, off target, left footed, high and wide.
[6316.16 - 6320.72] P:1942.03 E:0.097339 |  Few supporters behind that goal just throw their arms away in disgust as well.
[6321.28 - 6324.64] P:1946.60 E:0.078170 |  And Neuer quickly wants to take that goal kick.
[6324.64 - 6328.40] P:1930.41 E:0.088195 |  That was the first little bit of lazy play from Germany, picked up by Ramirez.
[6328.40 - 6330.72] P:1923.98 E:0.089807 |  Now the ball cannons away and there's a break-off.
[6330.72 - 6333.04] P:2185.08 E:0.103253 |  And all of a sudden, Germany going in search of an eight.
[6333.04 - 6334.16] P:2111.07 E:0.090592 |  It's played through the middle.
[6334.16 - 6335.04] P:2113.80 E:0.095489 |  This is Erzl.
[6335.04 - 6337.68] P:2090.50 E:0.098975 |  Erzl's got a chance to weigh this one up and he pulls it wide.
[6340.48 - 6342.56] P:1900.49 E:0.097623 |  Terrible miss from Mr. Erzl.
[6342.56 - 6347.84] P:1930.69 E:0.091541 |  Broke the off-side line, one-on-one with a goalkeeper on the edge of the 18-yard box,
[6347.84 - 6349.44] P:1936.79 E:0.074039 |  on his left foot, getting in.
[6349.44 - 6351.20] P:1927.51 E:0.085343 |  Just rolled this in, eight-nil.
[6352.40 - 6353.28] P:1810.12 E:0.104711 |  Dragged it wide.
[6354.40 - 6359.20] P:1953.82 E:0.090421 |  Just to put things into perspective, Brazil's first home defeat for 12 years
[6359.20 - 6360.88] P:1892.78 E:0.099549 |  as Oscars into the penalty area.
[6360.88 - 6362.88] P:2012.92 E:0.105220 |  Oscar now with the consolation.
[6363.84 - 6366.64] P:2027.84 E:0.105118 |  Oscar with the consolation, right footed, beach Neuer.
[6366.64 - 6369.04] P:2003.10 E:0.095090 |  There will be no fourth clean sheet for Germany,
[6369.68 - 6372.24] P:1967.71 E:0.096189 |  but it will make not one John of Difference for Brazil.
[6373.12 - 6379.36] P:2015.01 E:0.089389 |  They celebrate in the tamest of scenarios for Brazil.
[6380.96 - 6383.44] P:1986.92 E:0.092865 |  Brazil won Germany 7th.
[6383.44 - 6386.48] P:1944.66 E:0.086838 |  It will not alter the fact that the host nation
[6386.48 - 6392.00] P:1928.37 E:0.089166 |  have still been humiliated at home as two minutes have added on time here in Belo Horizonte.
[6392.24 - 6394.08] P:1965.97 E:0.102303 |  Germany will be a little bit disappointed with that,
[6394.08 - 6396.08] P:1801.53 E:0.081626 |  which is a long, hopeful ball through.
[6396.08 - 6401.36] P:1910.94 E:0.088064 |  But I think the cheers were ironic cheers more than anything else.
[6402.72 - 6405.12] P:1816.22 E:0.091638 |  I'm sorry, but it's 7-1, it's not even a consolation.
[6408.00 - 6412.08] P:1990.61 E:0.093364 |  Ball played forward to their first home defeat in 12 years,
[6412.08 - 6415.20] P:1996.58 E:0.089093 |  their first competitive defeat at home in 39 years,
[6415.92 - 6419.12] P:2062.02 E:0.087806 |  the heaviest defeat in a World Cup semi-final.
[6422.96 - 6426.88] P:1922.38 E:0.092916 |  And their record defeats in their illustrious history.
[6428.08 - 6430.72] P:1927.91 E:0.089387 |  Ball pulled back, Marcelo into the penalty area.
[6430.72 - 6433.68] P:1906.02 E:0.084862 |  And so it's William rather than Marcelo's in close proximity.
[6433.68 - 6434.64] P:1924.18 E:0.086409 |  There's the back heel.
[6435.76 - 6437.76] P:1932.07 E:0.094014 |  Bernard's sliding challenge comes from La,
[6437.76 - 6441.44] P:1944.69 E:0.078543 |  knowing the Germans, they'll complain about not being happy
[6441.44 - 6443.20] P:1992.65 E:0.088562 |  about keeping a fourth clean sheet.
[6443.20 - 6444.80] P:1894.26 E:0.092060 |  Well, Manuel Neuer certainly will be.
[6444.80 - 6447.76] P:1925.67 E:0.082904 |  You know, he's made some good saves in the second half,
[6447.76 - 6450.88] P:1913.84 E:0.077206 |  and he'll be bitterly disappointed as he's conceded a goal.
[6450.96 - 6452.88] P:1953.87 E:0.087917 |  Here is William into the penalty area,
[6452.88 - 6454.40] P:1982.72 E:0.086529 |  headed away then by Borteng.
[6455.04 - 6456.40] P:1884.21 E:0.081917 |  And that's why he got to admire them,
[6457.04 - 6458.88] P:1879.85 E:0.090914 |  that ruthless winning streak that they have.
[6459.68 - 6460.96] P:1876.14 E:0.098389 |  And Neuer now will go long,
[6462.08 - 6464.16] P:2005.77 E:0.108544 |  and deliberately keeps it low towards Erzl.
[6464.16 - 6465.76] P:1994.53 E:0.089342 |  And there's another break on here.
[6465.76 - 6467.36] P:2025.47 E:0.099181 |  Erzl carves the ball forward,
[6467.92 - 6470.48] P:2030.72 E:0.086879 |  and it's looking towards Draxler and Draxelmeitz.
[6470.48 - 6471.84] P:2082.92 E:0.075270 |  Now the referee's blown his whistle.
[6474.24 - 6477.76] P:1836.34 E:0.089552 |  I think the referee felt sorry for Luis Gustavo there.
[6477.84 - 6481.36] P:1797.03 E:0.081261 |  A little bit of a tangle of legs gave the free kick,
[6481.36 - 6482.40] P:1821.51 E:0.094426 |  and the referee ends the game.
[6482.40 - 6484.32] P:1915.93 E:0.085998 |  That's it. Humiliation.
[6484.32 - 6486.72] P:2039.48 E:0.098669 |  Brazil won, Germany 7th.
[6486.72 - 6488.88] P:2029.18 E:0.093039 |  Brazil's misery is complete,
[6488.88 - 6491.44] P:1975.23 E:0.092400 |  but it's a night that will haunt them forever.
[6492.32 - 6493.04] P:1959.59 E:0.090221 |  Mark Puget.
[6494.56 - 6499.04] P:1950.28 E:0.097110 |  Well, in 1950, when they lost the final game to Uruguay,
[6499.04 - 6502.00] P:1859.17 E:0.097046 |  in the Maracanar, it became known as the Maracanaso.
[6502.56 - 6504.88] P:1889.93 E:0.102517 |  I wonder if there's going to be a similar word here,
[6505.60 - 6507.52] P:1883.12 E:0.100331 |  as David Luiz is on all fours.
[6508.08 - 6510.96] P:1920.69 E:0.083719 |  Luis Gustavo, I think, is praying and crying.
[6510.96 - 6513.28] P:1952.25 E:0.098294 |  Several of the Brazilians slumped to the ground,
[6513.92 - 6516.08] P:1939.29 E:0.097568 |  while the Germans embrace each other.
[6517.28 - 6521.04] P:1828.36 E:0.086254 |  Brazil won, Germany 7th.
[6522.88 - 6526.32] P:1724.27 E:0.096676 |  Danny, nobody has a betting slip in the world with that on it.
[6526.88 - 6529.20] P:1894.37 E:0.094947 |  I don't care who they are and what they say.
[6529.20 - 6531.76] P:1814.68 E:0.091812 |  Nobody has a betting slip anywhere near like that on them.
[6532.72 - 6534.56] P:1826.79 E:0.095842 |  Not a chance. It's just been incredible.
[6535.20 - 6538.96] P:1797.13 E:0.091475 |  Look at the Brazilian players now. They'll feel humiliation.
[6538.96 - 6540.88] P:1717.70 E:0.091385 |  They'll be devastated. They'll be embarrassed.
[6542.64 - 6544.88] P:1813.66 E:0.099466 |  It's just unprecedented scenes.
[6544.88 - 6548.96] P:1792.74 E:0.089509 |  David Luiz, for about three minutes after the game, stood there,
[6548.96 - 6552.40] P:1814.55 E:0.088916 |  his two fingers in the air, on his knees, looking at the sky,
[6552.40 - 6554.56] P:1847.52 E:0.096749 |  obviously saying some sort of prayer, as you mentioned,
[6554.56 - 6555.60] P:1766.87 E:0.095856 |  Luis Gustavo as well.
[6556.40 - 6559.28] P:1810.46 E:0.084301 |  There are players down there inconsolable.
[6560.08 - 6561.84] P:1862.58 E:0.094515 |  I think Thiago Silva has just gone on.
[6561.84 - 6563.68] P:1842.19 E:0.077707 |  I think he's with Oscar.
[6563.68 - 6566.16] P:1927.35 E:0.102383 |  I think he's with Oscar, who's in absolute floods of tears.
[6566.16 - 6568.80] P:1841.94 E:0.092643 |  And I think, as Ian said, that Arsene Venger said,
[6568.80 - 6572.00] P:1829.32 E:0.081675 |  who's on French television, about 10 yards away from us,
[6572.00 - 6574.32] P:1934.23 E:0.097064 |  they will be traumatised for life by this.
[6574.32 - 6576.00] P:1824.30 E:0.095742 |  Danny, does that seem right?
[6576.72 - 6579.68] P:1745.47 E:0.093487 |  In a footballing sense, they will be traumatised forever
[6579.68 - 6583.04] P:1777.15 E:0.088063 |  by being part of this absolute humiliation.
[6583.68 - 6587.60] P:1758.21 E:0.086749 |  Completely. Because wherever you go, whatever happens,
[6587.60 - 6589.44] P:1837.44 E:0.097290 |  even if they go on and win the next World Cup,
[6590.08 - 6592.56] P:1802.92 E:0.087351 |  they will always be saying, you were part of that team.
[6592.64 - 6594.96] P:1861.31 E:0.090525 |  You let us down, you let yourselves down.
[6594.96 - 6599.28] P:1749.05 E:0.085643 |  But most importantly, you let 200 million people down.
[6599.28 - 6600.88] P:1780.17 E:0.086093 |  We talked about this before the game.
[6600.88 - 6604.48] P:1777.80 E:0.088111 |  We said, how many people will be wearing a yellow shirt
[6604.48 - 6605.52] P:1888.97 E:0.092178 |  or a Brazilian shirt?
[6606.08 - 6608.32] P:1743.17 E:0.083064 |  And we probably said maybe half the country,
[6608.32 - 6609.76] P:1777.19 E:0.090077 |  maybe 100 million people.
[6610.32 - 6613.12] P:1958.75 E:0.101696 |  Now, the Boos have started as the Brazilian team
[6613.12 - 6615.12] P:1919.71 E:0.095675 |  congregate in the centre circle.
[6615.68 - 6617.28] P:1925.36 E:0.099870 |  I wouldn't really say it's a huddle,
[6617.28 - 6619.44] P:2037.34 E:0.095167 |  it's a bit like they're defending, it's a bit of a mess,
[6619.44 - 6620.56] P:1940.62 E:0.095537 |  it's a bit of a mishmash.
[6621.12 - 6624.40] P:1943.74 E:0.102846 |  And Luis Felipe Scallari is having a word with Oscar.
[6624.40 - 6627.52] P:1947.37 E:0.096544 |  Oscar's been craved by Tiago Silva, like a father
[6628.24 - 6630.40] P:1913.75 E:0.103111 |  who knows that his son is very, very upset.
[6630.40 - 6634.16] P:1977.00 E:0.093685 |  There were some Boos, there's still some whistles,
[6634.16 - 6637.04] P:1952.44 E:0.094117 |  now the noises for the Germans who are going to their supporters,
[6637.04 - 6640.32] P:1902.31 E:0.088362 |  where the main bulk of their supporters is away to our right.
[6640.32 - 6642.96] P:1918.52 E:0.094500 |  And it looks like Scallari's almost having a debrief
[6642.96 - 6645.04] P:1894.39 E:0.087101 |  in the centre circle already.
[6646.32 - 6648.16] P:1887.69 E:0.103302 |  Listen to the whistles again.
[6651.52 - 6654.72] P:1926.32 E:0.104090 |  As the Brazilian team started to walk towards the team,
[6656.48 - 6657.68] P:1949.36 E:0.093569 |  to applaud their fans,
[6659.36 - 6661.04] P:1892.59 E:0.108973 |  and that's what they're getting in response.
[6662.88 - 6665.68] P:1955.38 E:0.090648 |  Rightly so, but I think Scallari came onto the pitch and said,
[6665.68 - 6670.40] P:1914.30 E:0.093631 |  don't you dare walk off this pitch without applauding your fans.
[6670.40 - 6672.80] P:1935.26 E:0.089289 |  They have turned up, not just here tonight,
[6672.80 - 6674.16] P:1923.89 E:0.096731 |  but all over the country,
[6674.96 - 6679.36] P:1884.66 E:0.090185 |  and a bit exceptional support on this nation as a football team.
[6679.44 - 6682.24] P:1905.01 E:0.096917 |  And I think he's going to say, look, you owe them something.
[6682.80 - 6687.36] P:1865.81 E:0.093266 |  Stand there, be a man, be counted, and apologise to the fans.
[6688.00 - 6689.76] P:1903.54 E:0.115989 |  And we see as we did before kick off,
[6689.76 - 6691.84] P:1905.83 E:0.102651 |  the German away to our right holding out the big card,
[6691.84 - 6693.28] P:1971.10 E:0.086552 |  which says four on it.
[6693.28 - 6697.44] P:1887.32 E:0.086614 |  Well, they will be favourites to win their fourth world title this Sunday.
[6697.44 - 6701.44] P:1896.28 E:0.093646 |  And as Ian said, it's either a repeat of the 1974 final against the Dutch,
[6701.44 - 6705.28] P:2015.85 E:0.089611 |  or the 1990 final against Argentina.
[6705.84 - 6709.12] P:1990.46 E:0.099783 |  Luis Felipe Scallari hauling himself down the tunnel.
[6709.12 - 6710.96] P:1975.61 E:0.103510 |  Luis is in floods of tears as well.
[6710.96 - 6713.44] P:2009.06 E:0.093542 |  Thiago Silva is walking off with him.
[6713.44 - 6717.04] P:1977.50 E:0.093050 |  But Thiago Silva should feel extremely responsible, daddy Mills,
[6717.04 - 6719.76] P:1858.34 E:0.095363 |  for a ludicrous and needless bookie against Colombia,
[6719.76 - 6721.36] P:1863.72 E:0.071189 |  which ruled him out tonight.
[6721.36 - 6723.76] P:1923.88 E:0.067333 |  Yeah, definitely. Didn't need to do it.
[6723.76 - 6726.56] P:1841.75 E:0.088928 |  Did he run past the goalkeeper, just nicked the ball off him,
[6726.56 - 6727.76] P:1938.90 E:0.086785 |  then kicked it in the back of the net.
[6728.32 - 6730.08] P:1956.40 E:0.089555 |  They appealed the decision, but, you know,
[6730.64 - 6733.44] P:1862.99 E:0.082678 |  he was never going to overturn that yellow card.
[6733.44 - 6735.12] P:2021.91 E:0.091371 |  He was sorely missed.
[6735.12 - 6737.04] P:2002.13 E:0.097394 |  I think David Luiz, just looking down the touchline,
[6737.04 - 6739.04] P:1886.78 E:0.078324 |  has been dragged away as captain.
[6739.04 - 6740.40] P:1919.64 E:0.089844 |  He's going to have to face the media.
[6741.68 - 6747.04] P:1753.29 E:0.085493 |  What, what, under a week ago, he was the Brazilian hero,
[6747.04 - 6748.64] P:1937.19 E:0.080561 |  an absolute legend.
[6748.64 - 6749.84] P:1858.97 E:0.094199 |  We talked about it before the game,
[6749.84 - 6752.88] P:1843.20 E:0.077961 |  the fans were talking about him, captains his team,
[6752.88 - 6756.56] P:1848.77 E:0.093046 |  in a World Cup semi-final, responsible for the first goal,
[6757.20 - 6758.80] P:1686.82 E:0.073870 |  and they get beaten 7-1.
[6758.80 - 6762.16] P:1798.20 E:0.088692 |  The only thing I would say, Mark, and Mike mentioned that FIFA
[6762.16 - 6766.80] P:1789.37 E:0.084547 |  didn't make any reference to the sad death of Di Stefano.
[6766.80 - 6769.44] P:1876.65 E:0.086369 |  Yesterday, just to put things into perspective,
[6769.44 - 6773.44] P:1901.30 E:0.090615 |  FIFA also didn't make any reference to the fact that last weekend
[6774.08 - 6777.52] P:1761.75 E:0.093569 |  two people died here in Belo Horizonte as a bridge collapsed.
[6777.52 - 6779.44] P:1869.13 E:0.087685 |  Twenty people were seriously injured,
[6779.44 - 6782.56] P:1727.69 E:0.090616 |  two people lost their lives here in Belo Horizonte.
[6783.12 - 6786.40] P:1946.89 E:0.092302 |  To put it into perspective, as a nation mourns a football defeat,
[6787.20 - 6789.84] P:1753.77 E:0.078844 |  there are more important things than a game of football.
[6789.84 - 6790.80] P:1952.85 E:0.111263 |  Absolutely, well said.
[6790.80 - 6793.84] P:1986.92 E:0.099068 |  I remember Michel Platini saying that he went back into the dressing room
[6793.84 - 6796.64] P:2070.83 E:0.093792 |  after the 1982 defeat to West Germany,
[6796.64 - 6798.64] P:1833.41 E:0.093305 |  and devastated though they were.
[6798.64 - 6801.60] P:1920.88 E:0.087407 |  He realised quite soon afterwards, nobody died,
[6801.60 - 6804.08] P:1797.93 E:0.077215 |  it's a game of football, we've lost.
[6804.08 - 6806.08] P:1953.32 E:0.095851 |  But Julia Gomez from BBC Brazil,
[6806.64 - 6810.88] P:1905.92 E:0.090440 |  this has to be the darkest day in the history of Brazilian football.
[6810.88 - 6813.36] P:1853.43 E:0.092804 |  Forget 1950, in the Maracanar, in Uruguay.
[6813.36 - 6814.88] P:1932.80 E:0.071360 |  Is this not worse?
[6814.88 - 6816.32] P:1733.98 E:0.085037 |  It is, it is.
[6816.32 - 6819.20] P:1716.36 E:0.084502 |  First of all, great words, definitely right.
[6820.08 - 6821.76] P:1308.84 E:0.093469 |  There are more important things than this,
[6823.52 - 6824.48] P:1795.33 E:0.068491 |  but yeah, definitely.
[6824.48 - 6826.88] P:1584.14 E:0.099719 |  It's the darkest day in Brazilian football, as I said.
[6827.76 - 6834.96] P:1633.45 E:0.083146 |  Hopefully it will be bad enough for Brazilian football to
[6836.40 - 6840.80] P:1516.23 E:0.088537 |  be born again, let's say, to rebuild all its structures.
[6842.00 - 6845.76] P:1509.62 E:0.080623 |  Everything is being done wrong in this country regarding football,
[6845.76 - 6848.88] P:1504.43 E:0.088668 |  since top level to youth football.
[6849.76 - 6852.00] P:1501.08 E:0.091134 |  And we needed a shock like this.
[6852.96 - 6857.84] P:1670.47 E:0.074564 |  Hopefully it will have consequences.
[6859.60 - 6863.36] P:1620.85 E:0.090895 |  One year from now, if you ask me, Julia, what has changed?
[6863.36 - 6864.88] P:1604.41 E:0.082744 |  And I tell you, nothing.
[6865.76 - 6868.24] P:1587.17 E:0.093686 |  Then it will be only sadness, isn't it?
[6868.24 - 6870.64] P:1720.97 E:0.085813 |  So hopefully this will be for good,
[6870.64 - 6876.00] P:1652.67 E:0.085281 |  this somehow will be worked by the football authorities here in Brazil,
[6876.00 - 6880.72] P:1755.10 E:0.074261 |  as the Germans did after that horrible year 2000
[6881.68 - 6883.28] P:1590.88 E:0.078409 |  in Belgium and Holland.
[6883.28 - 6886.32] P:1596.40 E:0.074648 |  This is the result of those defeats.
[6886.32 - 6890.24] P:1503.67 E:0.084463 |  Hopefully Brazil will take the same, or at least more or less,
[6890.24 - 6895.12] P:1532.79 E:0.084031 |  the same attitude, the same acts, so to change everything here.
[6895.12 - 6897.60] P:1684.94 E:0.096026 |  There are tears aplenty here in Belo Horizonte.
[6897.60 - 6899.28] P:1813.17 E:0.084585 |  The recriminations will start.
[6899.28 - 6902.64] P:1856.80 E:0.081294 |  So the word Maracanazo was born after that defeat.
[6902.64 - 6905.12] P:1781.22 E:0.083269 |  What word is going to be born after today?
[6905.12 - 6908.48] P:1766.31 E:0.096310 |  With the Minheiro Casso, I don't know, I've invented Portuguese here.
[6908.48 - 6913.68] P:1489.66 E:0.089278 |  Maracanazo comes from a Spanish word, because of Uruguay.
[6913.68 - 6916.72] P:1588.28 E:0.091186 |  So if we had lost to Chile, it would have been a Minerazo.
[6917.28 - 6920.08] P:1541.60 E:0.093817 |  I was talking to my friends, I don't know, maybe a Minerhaish.
[6920.72 - 6921.68] P:2025.92 E:0.094988 |  A Minerhaish.
[6921.68 - 6922.32] P:1656.94 E:0.097928 |  Minerhaish.
[6922.32 - 6923.04] P:2082.99 E:0.090904 |  Which would mean what?
[6923.04 - 6924.08] P:1693.96 E:0.088222 |  I don't know.
[6924.08 - 6927.76] P:1632.28 E:0.092039 |  I'm just mixing Minerão with German words.
[6927.76 - 6932.00] P:1952.93 E:0.079407 |  The Minerhaish, but it is the worst 90 minutes
[6932.00 - 6934.80] P:1874.11 E:0.083271 |  in Brazilian football history by a long way.
[6934.80 - 6935.84] P:1580.11 E:0.080104 |  Yeah, definitely.
[6935.84 - 6937.60] P:1674.36 E:0.099684 |  And all the humiliation, isn't it?
[6937.60 - 6943.60] P:1560.93 E:0.083507 |  I mean, your own supporters saying ole, ole, when the Germans were passing.
[6943.60 - 6947.68] P:1530.05 E:0.088899 |  Basically, to be honest, if the Germans wanted, they would have won what?
[6947.68 - 6948.64] P:1741.33 E:0.081601 |  15 to 0.
[6948.64 - 6955.44] P:1634.91 E:0.083910 |  They actually somehow they pity Brazil and Brazilians and took it easy.
[6955.44 - 6958.80] P:1507.42 E:0.084416 |  Because if they wanted, it would have been like what?
[6958.80 - 6961.20] P:1580.85 E:0.082187 |  12 to 1 or anything like that.
[6961.20 - 6965.36] P:1671.78 E:0.094316 |  So yeah, the whole humiliation, it became political somehow.
[6966.16 - 6968.72] P:1780.00 E:0.090619 |  Yes, they were swearing at the president, weren't they?
[6968.72 - 6970.08] P:1485.78 E:0.098002 |  They were swearing at the president.
[6970.08 - 6973.28] P:1571.18 E:0.077919 |  Obviously, these are not her voters.
[6973.28 - 6975.36] P:1460.80 E:0.098931 |  But yeah, it did happen.
[6977.04 - 6980.88] P:1750.17 E:0.082675 |  There will be people trying to make political use of it.
[6980.88 - 6984.16] P:1713.43 E:0.081059 |  It will be a shame, but it will happen, that's for sure.
[6984.16 - 6987.84] P:1524.91 E:0.091496 |  But again, what I really hope is that Brazil look at Germany.
[6988.72 - 6990.24] P:1428.91 E:0.090567 |  Everybody's looking at Germany, isn't it?
[6990.24 - 6994.72] P:1650.42 E:0.083342 |  I mean, what they did in these last 14 years in their academies,
[6994.80 - 6996.00] P:1666.54 E:0.083914 |  in their year football.
[6996.00 - 6998.40] P:1663.13 E:0.086109 |  This is not a lucky generation.
[6998.40 - 7003.44] P:1636.95 E:0.079513 |  This is a generation that they basically built, isn't it?
[7004.08 - 7006.08] P:1652.12 E:0.089137 |  This is just only the first one, actually.
[7006.64 - 7007.84] P:1393.40 E:0.101025 |  There will be more to come.
[7008.40 - 7012.96] P:1768.18 E:0.078768 |  So hopefully, Brazilian football will look at it and change.
[7013.92 - 7019.20] P:1908.15 E:0.088828 |  Since failing at Euro 2000, runners up in the World Cup in 2002 Germany.
[7019.20 - 7021.84] P:1981.32 E:0.094464 |  2004 the group stages, but then it really does kick on.
[7021.84 - 7027.28] P:1913.55 E:0.086603 |  2006 semi-finals, runners up in 2008, runners up in 2010.
[7027.28 - 7030.72] P:1901.28 E:0.085872 |  Semi-finals in 2012 and now a final in 2014.
[7032.00 - 7034.96] P:2040.06 E:0.102249 |  Sorry, David Lees has just finished his TV interview,
[7034.96 - 7038.80] P:1839.93 E:0.081767 |  walked down the tunnel and he was apologising to the fans.
[7038.80 - 7041.36] P:1952.94 E:0.086854 |  And his hands on his chest, put his hands in the air.
[7041.36 - 7044.80] P:1835.63 E:0.090888 |  And I think said the scoop, which is obviously, which is sorry to all the fans.
[7045.44 - 7046.64] P:1816.62 E:0.098521 |  He must be heartbroken.
[7046.64 - 7050.88] P:1876.79 E:0.088301 |  His big moment as captain of his nation has just been destroyed forever.
[7051.28 - 7056.56] P:1759.21 E:0.085369 |  It's the only name I heard people shouting here.
[7056.56 - 7058.00] P:1716.30 E:0.096797 |  Boing at him, shouting at him.
[7058.00 - 7059.84] P:1544.56 E:0.086964 |  Yeah, I'm in a positive way.
[7059.84 - 7060.56] P:1628.36 E:0.106912 |  Oh, in a positive way, right?
[7060.56 - 7061.92] P:1635.32 E:0.090627 |  Yeah, it's the only name.
[7061.92 - 7065.60] P:1706.27 E:0.088797 |  It's his one of the guys who will be forgiven.
[7065.60 - 7069.44] P:1658.34 E:0.084825 |  Obviously, the guys who aren't here, Thiago and Neymar, obviously.
[7069.44 - 7070.88] P:1344.26 E:0.089406 |  But there will be a lot of villains.
[7071.60 - 7072.64] P:1351.90 E:0.083017 |  There will be a lot of villains.
[7072.64 - 7074.88] P:1908.98 E:0.092098 |  And all the while, Mark Chapman, we just had a shot.
[7074.88 - 7079.20] P:1840.72 E:0.085904 |  And who complained them of German men celebrating drinking beer in their
[7079.20 - 7080.88] P:1689.70 E:0.092061 |  Lederhosen away to our right?
[7081.92 - 7084.40] P:1706.09 E:0.097518 |  Germany 7, Brazil 1.
[7085.92 - 7088.64] P:1714.10 E:0.105095 |  Rafael Honestain is in the Rio studio with me here.
[7089.28 - 7093.92] P:1763.48 E:0.085547 |  Did you think at the end the Germans looked not embarrassed to celebrate,
[7093.92 - 7095.60] P:1675.90 E:0.096855 |  but a little bit self-conscious.
[7095.60 - 7100.48] P:1560.96 E:0.076981 |  If I'm contrasting it with the quarterfinal with Brazil and Columbia,
[7100.48 - 7103.52] P:1617.21 E:0.096807 |  where, depending on your point of view, David Luiz either consoled
[7103.52 - 7109.12] P:1593.01 E:0.084151 |  or patronised James Rodriguez, the Germans very much left the Brazilians too.
[7110.08 - 7113.36] P:1262.66 E:0.090233 |  I think Clauser had a warm arm around.
[7113.36 - 7117.84] P:1245.95 E:0.088751 |  And the Dante was consoled by some of his Bayern teammates.
[7117.84 - 7121.68] P:1345.50 E:0.091116 |  But you could see this Germany team, the law of diminishing returns,
[7121.68 - 7122.72] P:1417.41 E:0.083887 |  returned to kicked in.
[7122.72 - 7127.44] P:1386.97 E:0.082518 |  Because with every goal by the final whistle, it felt less special.
[7127.44 - 7132.00] P:1394.76 E:0.080812 |  If this had been a scrappy 1-0, or the way they really had to battle
[7132.00 - 7136.80] P:1367.64 E:0.084029 |  against Argentina and France, the relief after the final whistle was incredible.
[7136.80 - 7141.76] P:1521.52 E:0.085568 |  Here, the game was over after 25 minutes, so it was just a long, long wait just to seed us out.
[7141.76 - 7146.64] P:1528.68 E:0.079944 |  And that professionalism is very much a mark of this side.
[7146.64 - 7151.20] P:1389.99 E:0.083939 |  Oliver Birhoff said he'd never seen, he'd been with many teams as a player
[7151.20 - 7154.96] P:1290.93 E:0.087835 |  and as a general manager, he'd never seen a team celebrate so little
[7154.96 - 7156.88] P:1262.45 E:0.072059 |  after going through the quarterfinals.
[7156.88 - 7161.76] P:1376.10 E:0.076745 |  They had a drink, they patted each other on the back, and then all went to bed.
[7162.48 - 7164.16] P:1319.27 E:0.091216 |  And this is the Germany team.
[7164.80 - 7171.20] P:1720.32 E:0.076667 |  At the danger of continuing stereotypes, Germany have been looking,
[7171.76 - 7178.08] P:1725.55 E:0.080804 |  as a team and as a nation, have been looking for that kind of pragmatism efficiency,
[7178.08 - 7179.84] P:1544.81 E:0.083895 |  because it had gone out a little bit.
[7179.84 - 7182.72] P:1628.19 E:0.090227 |  Or maybe they were too young, maybe they were a little bit too naive,
[7182.72 - 7184.40] P:1760.85 E:0.079905 |  the new generation is coming through.
[7184.40 - 7188.56] P:1536.58 E:0.080338 |  Now this side, they have six, seven players who already won the Champions League.
[7188.56 - 7192.16] P:1584.09 E:0.082211 |  You could see they are ready, they played with the maturity,
[7192.16 - 7196.96] P:1415.72 E:0.081182 |  and they were ready when Brazil started to falter, Germany were there,
[7196.96 - 7199.76] P:1467.90 E:0.078938 |  they didn't just continue, they went for the kill,
[7199.76 - 7201.68] P:1371.11 E:0.074617 |  and that's why they decided to game so early.
[7201.68 - 7203.60] P:1461.48 E:0.084648 |  Amy Lawrence alongside Rafa.
[7203.60 - 7206.32] P:1480.98 E:0.088001 |  Well, interested to hear you use the word pragmatism there,
[7206.32 - 7208.56] P:1502.12 E:0.084956 |  because if you think this is a pragmatic team,
[7209.36 - 7212.00] P:1509.60 E:0.104888 |  I mean to me this is a team to admire immensely,
[7212.00 - 7216.16] P:1603.00 E:0.087078 |  so much so that you begin to feel very strongly that this was the moment that,
[7216.64 - 7219.92] P:1381.39 E:0.089757 |  you know, we talk about the era of Spain being the team in world football,
[7220.00 - 7222.96] P:1363.97 E:0.084082 |  we all looked at ending when they went out of this World Cup,
[7222.96 - 7226.00] P:1269.57 E:0.082408 |  but in a way that ending has come here now,
[7226.00 - 7229.20] P:1352.74 E:0.091498 |  because this is the time when I think you look at Germany and say,
[7229.20 - 7230.96] P:1176.51 E:0.084630 |  this is modern football at its finest.
[7232.24 - 7236.40] P:1668.62 E:0.094301 |  You were nodding along at the end of when I was putting that question to Rafa,
[7236.40 - 7239.04] P:1591.76 E:0.091518 |  about the difference in the teams at the end of that game.
[7240.08 - 7243.04] P:1775.19 E:0.098616 |  Yeah, I'm still absolutely shell shocked,
[7243.04 - 7246.56] P:1640.86 E:0.087618 |  and I just feel so sorry for these Brazilian players.
[7247.52 - 7249.28] P:1680.71 E:0.107850 |  Can I ask why?
[7250.40 - 7255.92] P:1638.77 E:0.088126 |  Because this is a 90 minutes that they will be reminded of in 50 years time,
[7256.88 - 7260.64] P:1588.24 E:0.096730 |  and I knew some of the players from 1950 when they lost then,
[7261.52 - 7265.68] P:1568.49 E:0.088675 |  and I know how bitter they were about how they were treated,
[7265.68 - 7268.88] P:1575.78 E:0.098849 |  half a century afterwards, they were never ever allowed to forget,
[7268.88 - 7272.64] P:1758.88 E:0.079360 |  and that's harsh, that's really harsh.
[7272.64 - 7276.00] P:1706.18 E:0.107540 |  Class from Scolari at the end coming on, being the father figure,
[7276.56 - 7278.72] P:1482.52 E:0.082604 |  having said that, since the half hour mark,
[7278.72 - 7282.32] P:1505.45 E:0.088122 |  all he's been thinking of, I imagine, is how do I deal with this defeat?
[7282.32 - 7286.80] P:1473.57 E:0.095040 |  What can I do? Because there's nothing I can do to turn this game around.
[7286.80 - 7289.36] P:1778.89 E:0.105915 |  Do you think? And obviously we don't know, we're only surmising here,
[7289.36 - 7291.60] P:1547.35 E:0.094705 |  but we have the pictures obviously on the big screen.
[7291.60 - 7296.08] P:1641.32 E:0.093807 |  My belt here, the helicopters overhead here at the far end of the Copacabana beach,
[7296.08 - 7298.72] P:1735.00 E:0.091775 |  where there are still several police cars,
[7298.72 - 7300.80] P:1811.14 E:0.092694 |  lights flashing in the distance near the fan fest.
[7301.60 - 7305.44] P:1714.97 E:0.090441 |  It looks, as well as Luis Felipe Scolari giving Oscar a pep talk,
[7305.44 - 7310.16] P:1643.21 E:0.084072 |  it looked like he banged his own chest, and I say with some eyes,
[7310.16 - 7313.04] P:1679.03 E:0.096271 |  but he was zipped, so let me take the responsibility here.
[7313.04 - 7316.08] P:1702.07 E:0.091681 |  Do you think that's what he will do? Yes, I think he will.
[7316.08 - 7318.40] P:1560.47 E:0.088006 |  I think he has to, I think that's his role.
[7318.40 - 7321.92] P:1708.87 E:0.084443 |  I think it was almost quite touching the way that he took off his centre forward,
[7321.92 - 7324.56] P:1573.36 E:0.083009 |  Ferreji, to save him from what?
[7324.56 - 7327.68] P:1770.39 E:0.087661 |  Brazilian crowds, they can be absolutely vicious,
[7327.68 - 7329.60] P:1403.96 E:0.095696 |  and they have a tendency when things are going badly,
[7329.60 - 7333.28] P:1473.26 E:0.084055 |  they will pick on one player and they will go after him.
[7333.36 - 7337.92] P:1752.60 E:0.085259 |  And it was Ferreji, and anything that Ferreji would have done, no change.
[7337.92 - 7339.92] P:1757.48 E:0.093604 |  So let's get him out of the firing line, it's lost.
[7340.96 - 7342.32] P:1650.43 E:0.084955 |  Let's preserve him a little bit.
[7343.04 - 7348.00] P:1639.42 E:0.089260 |  And you tell the quality, anyone can be a gracious winner.
[7348.00 - 7350.72] P:1581.40 E:0.097766 |  Anyone can do what David Louise did to Hammy's Rodriguez the other day.
[7351.28 - 7353.92] P:1799.52 E:0.078340 |  How do you react in defeat?
[7353.92 - 7356.16] P:1674.94 E:0.082559 |  That really tells you who has class.
[7356.96 - 7360.56] P:1717.23 E:0.090778 |  And when we talk about what a defeat can mean for players, Amy?
[7360.56 - 7366.24] P:1602.70 E:0.085900 |  Yeah, we were reminded of the obvious situation from the 1950 final.
[7366.24 - 7369.12] P:1661.24 E:0.091276 |  And the comments of Barbosa, who was the goalkeeper,
[7369.12 - 7373.20] P:1784.77 E:0.076946 |  who was perhaps a bit unfairly scapegoated after that result,
[7373.20 - 7376.96] P:1674.81 E:0.096574 |  was something he lived with, and his quote really rings so horribly true
[7376.96 - 7378.24] P:1830.21 E:0.064862 |  for these Brazilian players.
[7378.24 - 7379.92] P:1879.13 E:0.079620 |  And he said shortly before his death,
[7379.92 - 7382.96] P:1799.74 E:0.089469 |  the maximum punishment in Brazil is 30 years imprisonment,
[7382.96 - 7387.84] P:1523.30 E:0.077759 |  but I've been paying for something I'm not even responsible for by now for 50 years.
[7388.80 - 7394.32] P:1481.12 E:0.088165 |  I've always thought that this team could lose without suffering the same consequences,
[7394.96 - 7398.48] P:1485.72 E:0.088078 |  but I never imagined that they could be absolutely humiliated.
[7398.48 - 7403.76] P:1795.45 E:0.094151 |  And this is a society where humiliation has a huge, huge power.
[7403.76 - 7405.60] P:1697.89 E:0.092781 |  And it's for that reason I feel so sorry for this team.
[7406.64 - 7411.36] P:1428.14 E:0.079450 |  I was just trying to think in historical context what this game means
[7411.36 - 7414.56] P:1454.17 E:0.091212 |  and what it could mean because a lot of it will depend on the final.
[7415.28 - 7419.36] P:1540.43 E:0.092085 |  If they don't win, as I said earlier, this will be seen almost like an empty defeat.
[7419.36 - 7423.12] P:1512.59 E:0.079634 |  If they are to win the World Cup, I think this game, this result,
[7423.12 - 7426.16] P:1371.35 E:0.094909 |  could have the same sort of resonance that Germany's win at Wembley.
[7426.16 - 7430.64] P:1563.47 E:0.089338 |  The first ever win at Wembley in 72 on the way to European Championships had,
[7430.64 - 7433.92] P:1224.65 E:0.086141 |  because England was seen as unbeatable at home.
[7434.88 - 7439.60] P:1440.11 E:0.092921 |  And with that win, Germany came of age, won the Euros, then won the World Cup.
[7440.24 - 7444.24] P:1319.57 E:0.088668 |  To beat Brazil, 7-1 in Brazil could have that similar kind of marker.
[7444.32 - 7446.40] P:1492.36 E:0.078181 |  As far as German football history is concerned.
[7446.40 - 7447.76] P:1920.44 E:0.102114 |  Let me read you some tweets.
[7447.76 - 7450.00] P:1782.00 E:0.092583 |  Joey Barton, who is David-Louise Prane too.
[7450.00 - 7453.60] P:1815.13 E:0.094758 |  If there is a God, he surely deserted him tonight on that performance.
[7453.60 - 7455.52] P:1786.57 E:0.101323 |  John Hart and I made a function in Edinburgh.
[7455.52 - 7458.32] P:1835.47 E:0.094081 |  What on earth has gone on in Brazil? 7-1. Wow.
[7458.32 - 7461.20] P:1809.19 E:0.084171 |  Heidi Klum, can you believe that?
[7461.20 - 7462.56] P:1651.49 E:0.098840 |  Can I just put out these ascent to me?
[7462.56 - 7465.12] P:1446.30 E:0.102972 |  I don't necessarily follow all the people that I'm reading out here.
[7466.56 - 7467.92] P:1629.24 E:0.108462 |  Heidi Klum, I really don't.
[7467.92 - 7469.20] P:1634.96 E:0.089373 |  Heidi Klum, can you believe this?
[7469.20 - 7472.08] P:1797.61 E:0.090023 |  I can't. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[7472.08 - 7475.44] P:1794.75 E:0.098602 |  Let's go to some Brazilian fans who are with Bruce Douglas this evening.
[7475.44 - 7477.76] P:1540.08 E:0.072691 |  Bruce? Yes, I'm in Cabal.
[7477.76 - 7479.28] P:1485.29 E:0.085230 |  It's this covered...
[7481.44 - 7482.64] P:1442.62 E:0.099657 |  And I'm with a fan now.
[7482.64 - 7484.00] P:1138.11 E:0.095114 |  I'm with Gabriela.
[7484.00 - 7486.64] P:1471.29 E:0.073407 |  I never had to walk down with a fan.
[7486.64 - 7487.20] P:1367.43 E:0.062352 |  What do you tell me?
[7487.20 - 7492.40] P:1519.22 E:0.089028 |  Well, we're having real problems with Bruce's line.
[7492.40 - 7494.32] P:1963.82 E:0.086686 |  So we will try again to reconnect.
[7494.32 - 7497.44] P:1876.71 E:0.093921 |  I will get a reaction of some Brazilian fans in a little while.
[7497.44 - 7499.28] P:1813.98 E:0.085316 |  Plenty more reactions have come.
[7499.28 - 7502.72] P:1787.23 E:0.093855 |  Mark Pugach and Mike Kingdom in Ian Dennis and Danny Mills
[7502.72 - 7506.08] P:1954.41 E:0.096896 |  are still in the stadium in Bella Horizonte here in the Rio Studio.
[7506.08 - 7508.72] P:1808.22 E:0.089477 |  Tim Vickery, Raphael Honestine and Amy Lawrence.
[7508.72 - 7511.28] P:1914.61 E:0.097127 |  Your reactions as well to an astonishing semifinal.
[7511.28 - 7515.04] P:1840.61 E:0.085410 |  85058, hashtag BBC World Cup.
[7515.04 - 7519.84] P:1764.47 E:0.086832 |  Germany have beaten Brazil 7-1 in the semifinal this evening.
[7519.84 - 7521.68] P:1640.77 E:0.091403 |  It's 5 past 11. Here's Nathan Turby.
[7523.20 - 7525.92] P:1342.61 E:0.106551 |  On digital, online, smartphone and tablet.
[7525.92 - 7528.32] P:1494.55 E:0.087029 |  This is BBC 5 Live.
[7528.32 - 7531.20] P:1290.77 E:0.113968 |  Thank you, Mark. The Brazilian captain tonight, David Luiz.
[7531.20 - 7535.12] P:1694.92 E:0.083078 |  Let's apologise to fans after the country's worst World Cup defeat,
[7535.12 - 7538.96] P:1587.61 E:0.095416 |  losing 7-1 to Germany in Bella Horizonte, as we've been hearing.
[7538.96 - 7540.96] P:1316.63 E:0.102775 |  Many of the players were in tears at the end.
[7540.96 - 7545.12] P:1562.29 E:0.091440 |  Germany will now go on to face the Netherlands or Argentina in the final.
[7545.76 - 7548.88] P:1372.56 E:0.102601 |  The top civil servant at the Home Office has told a committee of MPs
[7548.88 - 7551.84] P:1722.53 E:0.089483 |  there were no records to show whether documents were destroyed
[7551.84 - 7555.12] P:1548.07 E:0.084647 |  or simply lost by the department in the 1980s and 90s.
[7555.12 - 7558.16] P:1484.91 E:0.093295 |  Mark Sedwell was giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee
[7558.16 - 7563.28] P:1545.13 E:0.081913 |  about the loss of 114 files potentially relating to child abuse linked to Westminster.
[7563.28 - 7566.08] P:1617.16 E:0.091310 |  The Labour MP Simon Danchuk wasn't impressed.
[7566.08 - 7569.68] P:1332.04 E:0.078654 |  He couldn't tell us the names of the files that had gone missing.
[7569.68 - 7573.04] P:1293.64 E:0.083901 |  He couldn't tell us whether the investigator had interviewed
[7573.04 - 7577.12] P:1399.30 E:0.084702 |  the Home Office official who alleges that the Home Office had paid money
[7577.12 - 7579.44] P:1634.71 E:0.073047 |  to the paedophile information exchange.
[7579.44 - 7581.76] P:1324.71 E:0.084117 |  You would have thought that the permanent secretary
[7581.76 - 7586.88] P:1283.59 E:0.079129 |  would have done his homework before he went in front of these MPs today.
[7586.88 - 7591.84] P:1645.47 E:0.091187 |  The Israeli government says it's prepared to send ground troops into Gaza to confront Hamas.
[7591.84 - 7595.68] P:1458.68 E:0.095622 |  Palestinian militants in Gaza say they have fired rockets into Israel.
[7595.68 - 7599.36] P:1646.48 E:0.082362 |  The country's military says it shot down a rocket in the Tel Aviv area.
[7599.36 - 7604.64] P:1729.41 E:0.088317 |  Palestinian officials say at least 15 people have been killed in Gaza by Israeli airstrikes.
[7604.64 - 7606.64] P:1753.27 E:0.097793 |  Israel's president is Shimon Peres.
[7606.64 - 7611.52] P:1075.00 E:0.071871 |  We are shooting at our children, at our mothers, at our civilians.
[7611.52 - 7612.24] P:1119.16 E:0.094201 |  What for?
[7613.44 - 7615.36] P:985.37 E:0.078740 |  We cannot compromise with death.
[7616.00 - 7618.16] P:870.87 E:0.071915 |  We cannot compromise with rockets.
[7618.16 - 7621.12] P:832.71 E:0.079816 |  We cannot compromise with this sort of a behaviour.
[7622.00 - 7623.84] P:1473.09 E:0.060928 |  And we should stop them.
[7623.84 - 7626.56] P:1625.55 E:0.111587 |  Two men from Birmingham who travelled to Syria to fight with rebels
[7626.56 - 7630.00] P:1622.99 E:0.081293 |  have pleaded guilty to preparing to carry out terrorist attacks.

[7640.08 - 7644.24] P:1696.20 E:0.086668 |  It dropped by 1.3% in May compared with the previous month.
[7644.32 - 7649.44] P:1507.63 E:0.091303 |  An investigation has begun in the United States after six unopened vials of smallpox virus
[7649.44 - 7652.24] P:1623.56 E:0.093507 |  were found in a storage room in a government laboratory.
[7652.24 - 7655.52] P:1669.94 E:0.077925 |  The freeze-dried samples are thought to date from the 1950s.
[7655.52 - 7656.72] P:1744.49 E:0.067088 |  Five live breakfast.
[7656.72 - 7661.52] P:1565.39 E:0.104695 |  The crisis in Syria continues, of course, and now we hear one in four Syrian refugee women
[7661.52 - 7663.20] P:1293.17 E:0.094207 |  caught in a spiral of poverty.
[7663.20 - 7665.84] P:1416.51 E:0.111522 |  This is according to the UN's refugee agency.
[7665.84 - 7669.28] P:1795.46 E:0.099244 |  The civil war has torn apart families, has torn apart communities.
[7669.28 - 7673.12] P:1886.31 E:0.102740 |  These women, you find many women who have fled with their children, unable to flee with their
[7673.12 - 7674.32] P:1811.79 E:0.090208 |  husbands for the first time.
[7674.32 - 7677.60] P:1627.29 E:0.095763 |  They have to basically bear this burden of looking after the family
[7677.60 - 7680.24] P:1389.45 E:0.091152 |  and also being the sole provider for their families.
[7680.24 - 7684.24] P:1536.84 E:0.099147 |  Many of these women are dependent on age because they simply cannot find work.
[7684.24 - 7686.40] P:1178.82 E:0.095596 |  Many of these women have never worked before.
[7686.40 - 7687.60] P:1240.71 E:0.074646 |  Five live breakfast.
[7687.60 - 7689.28] P:1738.96 E:0.084836 |  Weekday mornings from six.
[7691.12 - 7694.72] P:1689.21 E:0.104729 |  You're listening to BBC Radio Five Live, your home of Brazil, 2014.
[7694.72 - 7699.76] P:1757.82 E:0.088627 |  This is Marpeu Gachin, Belo Horizonte on the night Germany burst the Brazilian bubble
[7699.76 - 7702.08] P:1987.03 E:0.083411 |  in the most extraordinary fashion.
[7703.28 - 7704.16] P:2027.11 E:0.069116 |  We get underway.
[7704.16 - 7705.92] P:1921.09 E:0.070606 |  Breath-taking fixture.
[7705.92 - 7706.96] P:2034.04 E:0.094652 |  Germany, Brazil.
[7706.96 - 7707.46] P:2008.86 E:0.066256 |  Corner kick.
[7707.46 - 7709.04] P:1827.05 E:0.083346 |  Troubles are very long way and it's gone in.
[7710.00 - 7712.00] P:1616.06 E:0.090824 |  And that man has done it again.
[7712.00 - 7712.88] P:1825.80 E:0.089742 |  Thomas Muller.
[7712.88 - 7714.16] P:1831.38 E:0.083545 |  It's gone into the area to Muller.
[7714.16 - 7715.36] P:1969.28 E:0.085588 |  And there's a chance for Closer.
[7715.36 - 7718.00] P:1926.70 E:0.092264 |  Great save from Cesar, but Closer's there.
[7718.00 - 7721.04] P:1856.23 E:0.085888 |  Second time round to break Ronaldo's record.
[7721.04 - 7723.68] P:1850.77 E:0.092660 |  Against all teams, he's done it against Brazil.
[7723.68 - 7726.08] P:1818.36 E:0.079058 |  And is there any way back now for the hosts?
[7726.08 - 7727.76] P:1834.60 E:0.088680 |  Larmish forward on the right-hand side.
[7727.76 - 7728.48] P:1869.57 E:0.081107 |  Muller's missed it.
[7728.48 - 7729.60] P:2023.72 E:0.085610 |  Cross for the shots.
[7729.60 - 7731.04] P:1994.92 E:0.094330 |  There's the third goal.
[7731.04 - 7733.60] P:1870.82 E:0.079994 |  And an Estadian that he's sulting yellow.
[7733.60 - 7734.96] P:1892.89 E:0.080670 |  A black cloud.
[7734.96 - 7736.16] P:1831.26 E:0.080629 |  Looms large.
[7736.16 - 7740.72] P:1634.13 E:0.090200 |  If you were giving points out of 10 so far, you might give Fernandinho one for putting his
[7740.72 - 7742.24] P:1730.72 E:0.090376 |  shirt on the right way around.
[7742.24 - 7743.28] P:1951.44 E:0.091658 |  Here is Kedira.
[7743.28 - 7744.72] P:2042.93 E:0.084866 |  Kedira back to gross.
[7744.72 - 7746.48] P:1986.85 E:0.088911 |  It's a second goal.
[7746.48 - 7752.16] P:1676.59 E:0.115424 |  Brazil are capitulating and the Germans are romping their way through to the final in the American R.
[7752.16 - 7753.04] P:1740.26 E:0.109069 |  This is Kedira.
[7753.04 - 7753.84] P:1925.58 E:0.106519 |  He's got options.
[7753.84 - 7755.28] P:1818.75 E:0.108795 |  He's pulled the ball back to Erzal.
[7755.28 - 7756.72] P:1852.66 E:0.116959 |  Here is Kedira again.
[7756.72 - 7759.60] P:1552.23 E:0.113247 |  And Kedira strokes the ball in right footed.
[7759.60 - 7761.36] P:1874.52 E:0.113572 |  Germany are running right.
[7761.36 - 7764.24] P:1533.86 E:0.102878 |  You get that? If you're just joining us, this is the score line.
[7764.24 - 7766.16] P:1650.73 E:0.106306 |  Brazil nail Germany five.
[7766.16 - 7768.08] P:1408.34 E:0.102879 |  And this is the World Cup semi-final.
[7768.08 - 7772.64] P:1581.84 E:0.106783 |  And I have never seen balloons punctured to the extent that they were here this season.
[7772.64 - 7774.32] P:966.27 E:0.113206 |  We are not closing off.
[7774.32 - 7776.48] P:909.81 E:0.099787 |  It's difficult to understand the attitude.
[7776.48 - 7777.68] P:1544.23 E:0.103064 |  Larmish to the penalty area.
[7777.68 - 7778.40] P:2226.29 E:0.118665 |  Low ball.
[7778.40 - 7778.88] P:1611.85 E:0.104939 |  Pulting.
[7779.84 - 7783.04] P:1840.78 E:0.113949 |  And it is a record-equalling defeat for Brazil.
[7783.68 - 7787.20] P:1910.75 E:0.091207 |  It is a night nobody will ever forget.
[7787.28 - 7789.76] P:1910.79 E:0.094898 |  You can now hear all the fans around the stadium.
[7789.76 - 7792.00] P:1734.76 E:0.113281 |  Every single one of them brewing.
[7792.00 - 7794.16] P:1655.78 E:0.111007 |  They are absolutely out of range.
[7794.16 - 7797.60] P:1629.24 E:0.104009 |  Brazil totally and utterly humiliated.
[7797.60 - 7800.88] P:1456.44 E:0.108838 |  In all the World Cups I've covered, this is absolutely impressive.
[7800.88 - 7804.32] P:1638.44 E:0.108152 |  Scherler has added a second for himself.
[7806.00 - 7808.72] P:1797.07 E:0.110969 |  And now Germany have scored seven.
[7808.72 - 7812.88] P:1979.42 E:0.086957 |  And it is the heaviest defeat in Brazil's history.
[7812.88 - 7818.88] P:2072.49 E:0.090401 |  And the herd continues on a night when the nation of Brazil is totally humiliated.
[7822.32 - 7827.52] P:1853.83 E:0.106148 |  A tweet from Jürgen Klinsmann, of course, who won the World Cup the last time that the Germans did in 1990.
[7827.52 - 7829.36] P:1806.09 E:0.090699 |  Germany right in World Cup history.
[7829.36 - 7831.04] P:1940.54 E:0.074030 |  Huge, huge compliment.
[7831.04 - 7832.32] P:1813.51 E:0.084960 |  So proud of them.
[7832.32 - 7836.32] P:1710.57 E:0.087726 |  Daniel Sturridge said fair play to close and broke my idol Ronaldo's record.
[7836.32 - 7837.52] P:2040.95 E:0.085049 |  Unbelievable achievement.
[7837.52 - 7841.84] P:1829.71 E:0.081099 |  And Kevin Peterson at five nil said, I've seen a few five nils before.
[7841.84 - 7843.44] P:1674.17 E:0.082725 |  It's not the end of the world, Brazil.
[7843.44 - 7845.36] P:1871.09 E:0.075851 |  Well, it got worse than that, my kingdom.
[7845.36 - 7849.12] P:1823.69 E:0.081093 |  It got seven-one in Germany's favour.
[7849.84 - 7854.32] P:1838.55 E:0.089624 |  The great thing about sport is that it just continues to enthrall and surprise us from time to time.
[7855.04 - 7858.40] P:1879.87 E:0.080843 |  Well, I've got to be a bit careful of hyperbole, Mark.
[7858.40 - 7863.52] P:1928.94 E:0.082350 |  But, you know, it's not only the most astonishing game there's ever been, I think, at any World Cup.
[7864.80 - 7868.40] P:1911.48 E:0.094899 |  It's one of the most astonishing games there's ever been in the history of the sport.
[7868.40 - 7871.60] P:1751.48 E:0.086166 |  It's sort of like a bit like the Hungarian victory at Wembley in the 50s.
[7871.60 - 7872.56] P:1579.71 E:0.055414 |  Isn't it?
[7872.56 - 7875.44] P:1903.25 E:0.093139 |  And I'm still trying to come to terms with it and make sense of it.
[7875.44 - 7878.64] P:1729.27 E:0.089389 |  And for it to happen here, because, you see, I've still got this...
[7879.44 - 7882.72] P:1789.54 E:0.090999 |  I've taken on board everything that's been said by our local friends,
[7882.72 - 7887.52] P:1715.28 E:0.077807 |  but I still have this old-fashioned romantic view of Brazilian football.
[7887.52 - 7890.24] P:1847.48 E:0.080880 |  I know this isn't the Brazil of the 60s and 70s.
[7890.24 - 7896.48] P:1842.25 E:0.076519 |  Nevertheless, I thought for me coming here, it was going to be the definitive World Cup,
[7896.64 - 7902.64] P:1848.48 E:0.082135 |  simply because I regard this country as being the heartbeat of the game, the rhythm of the game.
[7902.64 - 7906.96] P:1914.50 E:0.090848 |  And I think, you know, in this tournament, many of the visiting teams have also responded
[7906.96 - 7912.16] P:1906.43 E:0.073203 |  to the backdrop of being here, being in Brazil, the history, the culture, the home of the carnival.
[7912.16 - 7916.64] P:1870.56 E:0.087895 |  And so for it to happen here, of all places, is just absolutely extraordinary.
[7916.64 - 7920.64] P:1880.54 E:0.077226 |  The other thing I would say is that maybe I'm being presumptuous here,
[7920.64 - 7926.32] P:1796.83 E:0.082165 |  but I also think that once England got knocked out, I bet Brazil were a lot of people's second team.
[7926.32 - 7929.36] P:1894.09 E:0.082143 |  Even though this isn't the Brazil of Pelé and everything else, you know, Riverlinia,
[7930.24 - 7933.60] P:1705.45 E:0.086308 |  because of what they have come to represent over the years.
[7935.12 - 7938.08] P:1907.00 E:0.096581 |  The only player, of course, to have come out of this unscarred is Neymar,
[7939.20 - 7943.04] P:1867.86 E:0.085336 |  who didn't start his first game for two years here today.
[7943.04 - 7947.84] P:1687.99 E:0.073191 |  But the other thing that I'm slightly concerned about is,
[7947.84 - 7950.16] P:1884.27 E:0.089841 |  I'm not sure the Germans are getting all the credit that they should get,
[7950.16 - 7953.20] P:1793.29 E:0.090602 |  because in the aftermath of all this, it's all going to be about Brazil.
[7953.76 - 7957.68] P:1852.09 E:0.089060 |  For me, it's very simple. Raffer's in the studio still, I think.
[7958.40 - 7962.00] P:1936.17 E:0.085865 |  We've said this many times. I came away from Blum Fontaine four years ago.
[7962.00 - 7964.48] P:2046.55 E:0.086805 |  I then went to see them in Cape Town beat Argentina 4-0.
[7964.48 - 7967.44] P:1868.85 E:0.083589 |  I thought this was on the agenda, not 7-1 against Brazil,
[7967.44 - 7970.16] P:1837.99 E:0.081617 |  but I could see them as being potential World Cup winners here.
[7970.16 - 7975.92] P:1901.21 E:0.085341 |  But the thing is, Danny's been on the commission, where it works is the national team works in tandem
[7977.20 - 7979.68] P:1942.15 E:0.091202 |  with the German league. They're all in it together.
[7980.40 - 7984.08] P:1852.69 E:0.073663 |  And that's the lesson for me for English football, for the future.
[7985.04 - 7987.20] P:1970.15 E:0.113906 |  Let's have a word with the BBC reporter, Steve Evans,
[7987.20 - 7989.52] P:1763.66 E:0.093601 |  who's at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
[7989.52 - 7991.92] P:1732.14 E:0.093137 |  Steve, we're probably like us here in Balor Horizonte.
[7991.92 - 7995.12] P:1876.02 E:0.083275 |  They cannot quite believe what they've just been watching
[7995.12 - 7997.12] P:1906.13 E:0.088144 |  on the big screens there and in their homes.
[7998.96 - 8001.76] P:1581.34 E:0.101953 |  They're starting to believe it now, but you're absolutely right.
[8001.76 - 8006.64] P:1485.87 E:0.082450 |  When it was 5-0 after 30 minutes, people were sort of shaking their heads,
[8006.72 - 8011.60] P:1398.10 E:0.077100 |  as though some sort of mirage was appearing on all these screens around me.
[8011.60 - 8015.60] P:1355.91 E:0.092257 |  Now, we're way past midnight here at the Brandenburg Gate,
[8015.60 - 8017.84] P:1526.80 E:0.074718 |  and there is a Brazilian party going on.
[8017.84 - 8020.48] P:1415.32 E:0.080771 |  It's the kind of thing which is meant to happen in Rio,
[8020.48 - 8023.52] P:1444.65 E:0.079992 |  and not to happen in Germany, but it's the other way around.
[8024.80 - 8027.28] P:1543.61 E:0.078902 |  And I was listening to your contributor earlier.
[8027.28 - 8032.32] P:1463.38 E:0.080944 |  I think what's impressed them here is that there was a bit of style to that play.
[8032.32 - 8037.28] P:1549.74 E:0.071136 |  It was kind of machine football, but beautifully played.
[8037.28 - 8042.24] P:1404.68 E:0.074206 |  There was imagination and working things, and that's what they love about it.
[8042.24 - 8044.24] P:1392.49 E:0.080660 |  They just think, bring on the final now.
[8045.92 - 8047.20] P:1793.39 E:0.106386 |  Steve, thank you very much indeed.
[8047.20 - 8049.20] P:1931.65 E:0.095020 |  Steve Evans at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
[8049.20 - 8051.76] P:1842.25 E:0.088261 |  Tim Vickery back in our Rio studio.
[8051.76 - 8052.88] P:1729.67 E:0.090515 |  Tim, is this the end of...
[8052.88 - 8056.16] P:1843.37 E:0.083036 |  I'm not saying before the third place match, but is this the end of Scolari?
[8056.96 - 8059.20] P:1499.20 E:0.100552 |  Oh, I would imagine so. I think he was going to go anyway.
[8059.92 - 8063.12] P:1592.02 E:0.093405 |  And before the Chile game, he said, whatever happens,
[8063.12 - 8065.44] P:1622.36 E:0.099093 |  I'm still the last Brazilian coach to win the World Cup.
[8066.40 - 8067.76] P:1499.47 E:0.098580 |  Feels a little bit hollow now.
[8068.88 - 8070.48] P:1735.38 E:0.099677 |  A couple of points on what's just been said,
[8070.48 - 8073.92] P:1556.61 E:0.092001 |  and clearly agree on the danger of Germany not getting enough credit.
[8073.92 - 8077.04] P:1628.59 E:0.094130 |  If they do go all the way, this will be one of the greatest
[8077.04 - 8078.72] P:1534.89 E:0.094758 |  World Cup wins in the history of the sport.
[8079.28 - 8082.48] P:1538.26 E:0.097847 |  Germany had a ferocious first round draw,
[8082.48 - 8086.24] P:1555.30 E:0.089726 |  not only in terms of opponents, but in terms of the location of their games.
[8086.24 - 8087.68] P:1728.57 E:0.092811 |  Last year, after the Confederations Cup,
[8087.68 - 8089.76] P:1439.58 E:0.084562 |  Oliver Bierhoff, their technical director,
[8089.76 - 8093.28] P:1678.29 E:0.089949 |  said it would be almost impossible for a European team to win this World Cup.
[8093.28 - 8097.28] P:1694.34 E:0.090499 |  Germany have done it so far, the hard way, and in style.
[8098.08 - 8101.44] P:1794.33 E:0.088979 |  And something Mike said about other teams,
[8101.44 - 8104.88] P:1668.07 E:0.089647 |  maybe have responded to the Brazilian backdrop in this World Cup.
[8104.88 - 8106.48] P:1732.32 E:0.099483 |  Well, maybe to an extent,
[8107.12 - 8111.36] P:1699.38 E:0.080373 |  but I think it's perhaps more true to flip it round the other way.
[8111.36 - 8116.88] P:1681.73 E:0.087336 |  I think Brazilian crowds have responded to the quality of modern football
[8116.96 - 8120.40] P:1751.85 E:0.084730 |  played by the other teams, because the football on display,
[8120.40 - 8124.96] P:1563.79 E:0.084240 |  and I felt this very clearly in the game between Ghana and Germany,
[8125.52 - 8129.84] P:1784.20 E:0.089571 |  a really pulsating second half, really intense.
[8129.84 - 8132.48] P:1649.06 E:0.097700 |  And this is the thing that the Brazilian media are picking up on,
[8132.48 - 8134.40] P:1812.85 E:0.088797 |  the intensity of the games.
[8134.40 - 8138.88] P:1790.83 E:0.088106 |  In comparison with domestic football in Brazil, this is just a...
[8140.00 - 8144.24] P:1844.70 E:0.090339 |  It's not even one class, it's two classes, three classes, four classes above.
[8144.32 - 8148.96] P:1832.79 E:0.086531 |  Brazilian football has suffered the huge danger of success,
[8148.96 - 8150.88] P:1833.98 E:0.085600 |  which is that you become complacent,
[8150.88 - 8152.96] P:1646.52 E:0.091325 |  and you think that your history will get you through.
[8152.96 - 8155.36] P:1791.66 E:0.087413 |  Julio Gomez has been making absolutely these points,
[8155.36 - 8156.96] P:1581.39 E:0.090763 |  and quite brilliantly as well.
[8156.96 - 8161.76] P:1824.86 E:0.082368 |  This is the moment when all of that balloon should be punctured.
[8161.76 - 8166.16] P:1637.10 E:0.083878 |  The medicine today for Brazilian football has been very, very cruel,
[8166.16 - 8168.16] P:1698.28 E:0.081431 |  but also, I think, very necessary.
[8169.52 - 8172.40] P:1849.34 E:0.077728 |  I think what is going to be interesting, Mark, about this,
[8172.40 - 8176.32] P:1779.98 E:0.091809 |  if Germany do go on and win the final, 1-0, 2-1, 3-1,
[8177.12 - 8181.04] P:1773.73 E:0.086217 |  I'm not sure they're going to be remembered for the final.
[8181.04 - 8184.32] P:1709.76 E:0.094200 |  It would almost be a case of, who did Germany play in the final?
[8184.32 - 8188.48] P:1792.24 E:0.093955 |  You know, when they won it in Brazil, they beat Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final.
[8189.04 - 8191.60] P:1781.80 E:0.093333 |  This will probably be the memorable game.
[8191.60 - 8193.52] P:1915.50 E:0.088511 |  People will almost forget about the final,
[8193.52 - 8196.00] P:1700.89 E:0.088448 |  because this is the game that everybody will remember.
[8197.04 - 8199.76] P:1853.51 E:0.094727 |  Well, yes, I think you're right, Danny,
[8199.76 - 8202.72] P:1775.92 E:0.082064 |  but I think if a little man called Messi runs the game
[8202.72 - 8204.88] P:1893.48 E:0.091345 |  in the way that Maradona did, and if he gets to the final,
[8204.88 - 8207.44] P:1806.45 E:0.087898 |  then I think we'll also be going away with a memory of that too,
[8207.44 - 8208.32] P:1869.77 E:0.093597 |  but I know what you're saying.
[8208.32 - 8211.04] P:2007.34 E:0.099162 |  I'm sure if Germany win it, everyone will be...
[8211.04 - 8213.04] P:1925.42 E:0.092880 |  This is the game that everybody will remember.
[8213.04 - 8216.24] P:1730.71 E:0.084240 |  Oh, Messi might score 4-3 or 4-1 in the World Cup final,
[8216.24 - 8218.16] P:1857.45 E:0.083910 |  if they get there, and we'll be talking about that,
[8218.16 - 8221.60] P:1714.59 E:0.077138 |  but I just think this game, you'll never...
[8221.60 - 8224.08] P:1769.05 E:0.067191 |  I don't think I've been in contact as long as you,
[8224.08 - 8226.80] P:1857.70 E:0.095900 |  but we will never, ever see anything like this ever again.
[8226.80 - 8228.88] P:1914.12 E:0.100343 |  I was interested in what Rafa said earlier on the program,
[8229.28 - 8234.80] P:1683.71 E:0.075638 |  in some respects, Mark, do they want to be overwhelming favourites?
[8234.80 - 8236.48] P:1885.97 E:0.088777 |  Because that's what everybody's going to make them now.
[8236.48 - 8239.36] P:1872.28 E:0.090563 |  Whoever they play, Holland or Argentina, after this,
[8239.36 - 8240.32] P:1821.84 E:0.090625 |  Germany are the favourites,
[8240.32 - 8241.92] P:1734.98 E:0.075162 |  and maybe they won't be comfortable with that role.
[8242.96 - 8249.28] P:1469.12 E:0.093357 |  I think if they lose the final to Holland or Germany or Argentina,
[8249.28 - 8252.00] P:1291.51 E:0.101289 |  they will be like Holland 74, Hungary 54.
[8253.28 - 8255.76] P:1649.52 E:0.097641 |  A great team who fell at the final hurdle.
[8256.48 - 8257.20] P:1879.60 E:0.092915 |  Sorry, Chelsea.
[8257.92 - 8259.76] P:1834.28 E:0.091096 |  Would it... How bad would it now be
[8261.36 - 8263.12] P:1857.26 E:0.093717 |  if Argentina now win the World Cup?
[8264.56 - 8265.76] P:1725.39 E:0.117034 |  It would make things worse.
[8266.64 - 8269.20] P:1970.19 E:0.108870 |  Can it get any worse, Julia? I've got my arm around, Julia.
[8269.20 - 8270.32] P:1924.61 E:0.097003 |  Can it get any worse?
[8270.32 - 8271.44] P:1707.85 E:0.081157 |  I think it can.
[8271.44 - 8273.84] P:1628.53 E:0.098712 |  Messi scores a hat trick tomorrow, and a hat trick on Sunday.
[8273.84 - 8275.04] P:1166.36 E:0.091543 |  Yeah, it would be similar.
[8275.04 - 8280.32] P:1425.77 E:0.081091 |  But I tell you what, I think Brazil will back Germany up,
[8280.96 - 8285.84] P:1465.64 E:0.084678 |  even against Holland, because somehow we still have this, isn't it?
[8285.84 - 8290.88] P:1570.23 E:0.082588 |  I mean, we like football, we love football, and this Germany team,
[8290.88 - 8293.20] P:1674.01 E:0.089773 |  I don't know when they scored the sixth or fifth,
[8293.20 - 8295.36] P:1716.02 E:0.079046 |  when they lost count, they were applauded.
[8295.36 - 8297.68] P:1731.98 E:0.079220 |  Well, they were applauded for the seventh.
[8297.68 - 8298.24] P:1614.01 E:0.076094 |  For the seventh, right.
[8298.24 - 8301.28] P:1802.26 E:0.092962 |  Yes, I think there were boos for the sixth and applause for the seventh.
[8301.28 - 8302.48] P:1693.07 E:0.079318 |  I think that's the way it was.
[8302.48 - 8303.76] P:1822.83 E:0.090097 |  You're going to have to translate this for us.
[8303.76 - 8305.68] P:1752.70 E:0.089093 |  We want to play this David Luiz interview in Portuguese,
[8305.68 - 8307.92] P:1814.66 E:0.087735 |  because you can hear how emotional he is.
[8307.92 - 8309.12] P:1802.42 E:0.089423 |  So let's have a listen first.
[8316.16 - 8319.60] P:1261.41 E:0.079609 |  I just wanted to give my people joy.
[8321.60 - 8324.48] P:1065.09 E:0.099513 |  My people, who are already suffering from this,
[8326.48 - 8328.64] P:1062.06 E:0.103196 |  unfortunately we didn't get it.
[8331.28 - 8332.64] P:1166.15 E:0.098848 |  I'm sorry, everyone.
[8333.20 - 8334.80] P:1092.78 E:0.100759 |  I'm sorry, everyone.
[8336.80 - 8338.64] P:1158.60 E:0.091350 |  I just wanted to see my people smiling.
[8341.92 - 8345.04] P:1163.47 E:0.079989 |  Everyone knows how important it was for me.
[8346.48 - 8346.96] P:1334.90 E:0.081145 |  Very.
[8347.60 - 8350.08] P:1799.11 E:0.104953 |  Now you said the school pay a few times, which means sorry, doesn't it?
[8350.08 - 8351.04] P:1202.77 E:0.108295 |  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8351.04 - 8355.04] P:1629.09 E:0.085506 |  He says he only wanted to bring joy to his people,
[8355.84 - 8359.84] P:1423.35 E:0.088352 |  to put a smile on his people's face, and he was really sorry.
[8359.84 - 8360.64] P:1737.82 E:0.077216 |  He was really sorry.
[8360.64 - 8362.96] P:1352.40 E:0.075466 |  He said that many, many times.
[8362.96 - 8363.84] P:1505.44 E:0.096505 |  It's emotional, yeah.
[8364.80 - 8370.56] P:1464.32 E:0.093641 |  It's hard to hear a professional footballer, a man, a good man.
[8371.44 - 8372.40] P:860.42 E:0.103097 |  He is a good man.
[8372.40 - 8373.84] P:1168.80 E:0.080810 |  He's a great guy.
[8374.72 - 8375.84] P:1685.62 E:0.086680 |  It's difficult.
[8376.96 - 8379.52] P:1654.57 E:0.098117 |  It's painful to listen to that, because you say he is a good man.
[8379.52 - 8380.88] P:1798.61 E:0.072556 |  It's painful to listen to that.
[8380.88 - 8382.40] P:1837.24 E:0.096614 |  John Southland is down in the mix zone.
[8382.40 - 8384.00] P:1803.11 E:0.090921 |  Now this is where the players come past.
[8384.00 - 8385.28] P:1634.36 E:0.084871 |  They don't have to stop.
[8385.84 - 8386.64] P:1460.87 E:0.114346 |  They really don't.
[8387.28 - 8388.24] P:1435.71 E:0.103913 |  Quite often they don't.
[8388.24 - 8389.44] P:1581.32 E:0.096070 |  John, what's the scene down there?
[8390.48 - 8392.80] P:1309.56 E:0.102786 |  Well, you know what mix zone is like, Mark,
[8392.80 - 8397.20] P:1295.80 E:0.098273 |  but I've never seen so many people in the mix zone before in any competition.
[8397.20 - 8400.40] P:1477.20 E:0.098529 |  There must be 200-plus journalists down here waiting, as you say,
[8400.40 - 8401.52] P:1199.13 E:0.092647 |  for the players to come through.
[8402.24 - 8403.44] P:1239.67 E:0.108432 |  No sign of anybody yet.
[8403.44 - 8406.56] P:1490.34 E:0.092356 |  I'm sure the German players will be more than happy to stop.
[8407.12 - 8410.56] P:1165.19 E:0.091717 |  Now I've done three Brazil games at this World Cup,
[8410.56 - 8413.36] P:1477.45 E:0.093752 |  and generally the Brazilians have always stopped.
[8413.36 - 8415.20] P:1383.12 E:0.085091 |  They've always spoken to the media.
[8415.20 - 8419.52] P:1374.57 E:0.092574 |  David Luiz, who I know from Chelsea, as we just heard from him there,
[8419.52 - 8423.52] P:1519.74 E:0.088842 |  is such a decent individual and he's such a decent man.
[8423.52 - 8426.16] P:1330.06 E:0.087544 |  But I wonder tonight if he will stop.
[8426.16 - 8429.60] P:1385.92 E:0.088680 |  I mean, he will possibly be one of the only ones who does.
[8429.60 - 8433.44] P:1243.70 E:0.090728 |  And how long it will be before the Brazil team come through here,
[8433.44 - 8434.40] P:1339.97 E:0.098188 |  is anybody's guess.
[8434.40 - 8435.92] P:1287.50 E:0.094630 |  It could be a long time.
[8435.92 - 8437.12] P:806.41 E:0.102540 |  It could be a long night down here.
[8438.08 - 8439.52] P:933.15 E:0.086214 |  I'll tell you what, they will all stop.
[8440.08 - 8442.24] P:1109.74 E:0.105295 |  That's what happened in 2010.
[8443.04 - 8449.36] P:1474.45 E:0.090649 |  I had never seen and never saw after that such a devastating mix zone
[8449.36 - 8452.56] P:1433.83 E:0.085823 |  as in 2010, the Brazilian defeat to Holland.
[8453.76 - 8456.72] P:1483.44 E:0.089674 |  It will probably break the record tonight.
[8457.36 - 8462.00] P:1438.69 E:0.085846 |  But it's a characteristic of these Brazilian players.
[8462.00 - 8465.36] P:1724.46 E:0.078940 |  They never escape from their responsibility.
[8465.36 - 8469.76] P:1609.94 E:0.076586 |  They will all, maybe Fred will escape the reporters,
[8469.76 - 8471.36] P:1342.22 E:0.099275 |  but they will all talk.
[8471.36 - 8472.48] P:1221.18 E:0.089698 |  They will all be crying.
[8472.48 - 8476.16] P:1568.01 E:0.076904 |  There won't be much to say, but they will all be there.
[8476.16 - 8478.00] P:1815.81 E:0.090803 |  What they do is they sort of walk down an avenue,
[8478.00 - 8480.32] P:1786.60 E:0.080536 |  which is sort of through barriers.
[8480.32 - 8481.92] P:1995.95 E:0.090882 |  And as John has just described,
[8481.92 - 8484.16] P:1519.69 E:0.089028 |  there are a couple of hundred reporters there,
[8484.16 - 8486.56] P:1947.23 E:0.088822 |  radio and TV and newspapers as well.
[8486.56 - 8488.96] P:1915.60 E:0.087784 |  And you basically shout and you say, can we have a word?
[8488.96 - 8491.20] P:1899.38 E:0.094093 |  You have a word with the BBC and it's up to them
[8491.20 - 8492.32] P:1891.68 E:0.086479 |  whether they stop or not.
[8492.32 - 8495.76] P:1868.98 E:0.085556 |  Luis Felipe Scolari has just said in their press conference,
[8495.76 - 8498.32] P:1839.72 E:0.075405 |  we ask for forgiveness.
[8498.32 - 8500.24] P:1921.74 E:0.093012 |  To the people, please excuse us.
[8500.24 - 8502.48] P:1768.92 E:0.083790 |  I'm sorry, we could not get to the final.
[8503.12 - 8508.16] P:1770.61 E:0.083268 |  What was so extraordinary about the way this game panned out, Mark,
[8508.16 - 8512.32] P:1886.17 E:0.087816 |  was that I'd love to rewind the tape and listen to our first eight or nine minutes.
[8512.32 - 8513.60] P:1953.32 E:0.093014 |  Danny and I were commentating.
[8513.60 - 8518.32] P:1870.75 E:0.086346 |  We were just all of us taken aback emotionally by the anthem.
[8519.36 - 8523.04] P:2027.39 E:0.096842 |  The German players seemed to shrink actually for the first eight or nine minutes.
[8523.04 - 8525.12] P:1949.89 E:0.091939 |  I saw them come out against France in the quarterfinal
[8525.12 - 8527.92] P:1874.83 E:0.081821 |  and just control the game right from the start.
[8527.92 - 8530.32] P:1932.40 E:0.085245 |  And all of our commentary was suggesting
[8530.32 - 8532.64] P:1893.35 E:0.094709 |  that the Brazilians have made a fantastic start,
[8532.64 - 8534.24] P:1896.04 E:0.086560 |  the Germans look a little bit rattled,
[8534.80 - 8538.40] P:1715.79 E:0.086624 |  and then I have never seen floodgates open in the way that they did here.
[8538.40 - 8539.84] P:1964.25 E:0.093205 |  It was almost their first attack, wasn't it?
[8539.84 - 8541.60] P:1941.15 E:0.087014 |  You go back for the first 11 minutes,
[8542.16 - 8544.88] P:1843.71 E:0.088045 |  Brazil, you know, okay, their final ball wasn't brilliant,
[8544.88 - 8548.56] P:1877.57 E:0.078975 |  but they were high tempo, they were closing people down.
[8548.56 - 8550.64] P:1982.89 E:0.083943 |  They created some half chances,
[8550.64 - 8553.60] P:1827.43 E:0.085073 |  and they came out like they did against Colombia on the front foot,
[8553.60 - 8555.36] P:1893.66 E:0.073174 |  and we're going to go for this.
[8555.36 - 8557.52] P:2012.84 E:0.097338 |  Suddenly, Germany were giving the ball away,
[8557.52 - 8558.96] P:1976.56 E:0.081221 |  which is very un-German like.
[8559.52 - 8564.00] P:1816.48 E:0.077236 |  The corner comes in, David Luiz loses concentration, 1-0,
[8564.88 - 8566.00] P:1861.78 E:0.077637 |  and then it just fell apart.
[8566.00 - 8567.20] P:2023.42 E:0.115652 |  And there's no excuse for that, Danny.
[8567.20 - 8568.88] P:1971.30 E:0.100544 |  You're the defender, a World Cup defender.
[8568.88 - 8571.44] P:2006.98 E:0.085063 |  There's no excuse, even though the goal
[8571.44 - 8573.84] P:1832.69 E:0.088695 |  the Mula goal was very, very sloppy.
[8573.84 - 8576.80] P:1896.51 E:0.079905 |  There's no excuse for what followed after that, is there?
[8576.80 - 8579.76] P:1757.38 E:0.084687 |  They're only 1-0 down, they've got 80 minutes to get it back.
[8580.48 - 8582.88] P:2066.79 E:0.094201 |  Exactly. Well, the excuse for David Luiz's goal,
[8582.88 - 8586.48] P:1870.83 E:0.088260 |  I think he was so pumped up, there was so much adrenaline flowing,
[8586.48 - 8590.24] P:1947.38 E:0.081554 |  we saw the emotion in the players' eyes, the anthem.
[8591.28 - 8594.56] P:1884.77 E:0.087761 |  They were so pumped up on adrenaline, they were chasing round,
[8594.56 - 8598.16] P:1837.18 E:0.080731 |  here and everywhere, like crazy men, all over the place.
[8598.16 - 8600.32] P:1805.33 E:0.083420 |  And that sort of flowed into that first 10-15 minutes.
[8600.32 - 8603.36] P:1843.31 E:0.073983 |  He lost concentration, lost his man, but then they did,
[8603.36 - 8606.88] P:1836.62 E:0.082580 |  they just fell apart, and it was in the end, it was sad to see.
[8607.44 - 8609.20] P:1624.62 E:0.106076 |  Have you got a theory why they fell apart?
[8609.20 - 8610.64] P:1538.59 E:0.082959 |  I think it's tactical.
[8611.52 - 8615.68] P:1372.36 E:0.084436 |  I slightly disagree with you guys, after 10 minutes, I tweeted,
[8616.48 - 8617.84] P:1586.22 E:0.074524 |  and it was new, new.
[8617.84 - 8620.80] P:1572.36 E:0.090745 |  If Brazil keeps playing like that, it's 3-0 after half-hour.
[8620.80 - 8623.44] P:1545.83 E:0.081731 |  I didn't see it coming 5-0 after 25.
[8623.44 - 8628.24] P:1486.11 E:0.087288 |  But I really thought the team was as open as in the other matches.
[8628.24 - 8630.64] P:1432.58 E:0.086213 |  No midfield, Bernhard here.
[8630.64 - 8635.20] P:1671.54 E:0.077463 |  I mean, it was a dreadful decision to use Bernhard.
[8635.20 - 8639.20] P:1562.01 E:0.088952 |  Now, okay, it's easy to say now, but we were talking about that before.
[8639.20 - 8641.52] P:1540.69 E:0.086704 |  It was a gamble. It was a gamble.
[8641.52 - 8644.00] P:1587.88 E:0.082478 |  Brazil could have scored in the first 5-6 minutes,
[8644.00 - 8644.88] P:1323.01 E:0.080829 |  it could have happened.
[8645.60 - 8648.56] P:1358.11 E:0.085455 |  It didn't, and then the team was completely open.
[8648.56 - 8652.72] P:1563.17 E:0.076659 |  So it really reminded me, not a couple of,
[8652.72 - 8656.32] P:1555.59 E:0.083291 |  but some Barcelona matches throughout the years,
[8656.32 - 8660.00] P:1696.70 E:0.081490 |  when they struggled in the first 10 minutes just to adjust.
[8660.00 - 8663.36] P:1682.39 E:0.069238 |  And when they adjusted, it was a massacre.
[8663.36 - 8667.12] P:1572.84 E:0.090049 |  So it looked to me that after 10 minutes, the German had adjust.
[8667.76 - 8671.04] P:1650.16 E:0.080906 |  And if Brazil didn't respond to that,
[8671.04 - 8674.48] P:1508.64 E:0.084011 |  it would be a massacre just as it was.
[8675.12 - 8678.40] P:1822.66 E:0.072893 |  And we highlighted pretty much Marcelo.
[8678.40 - 8681.84] P:2016.80 E:0.091694 |  A-Wal, defensive midfielders, nowhere to be seen.
[8683.04 - 8686.16] P:1962.51 E:0.094267 |  I would actually pin the blame more at those defensive midfield players,
[8686.16 - 8688.40] P:1911.36 E:0.088785 |  because everyone knows what Marcelo is all about.
[8688.40 - 8689.60] P:1930.68 E:0.073016 |  That's the tactic.
[8689.60 - 8691.36] P:2025.10 E:0.100721 |  And in the past, we've been used to say,
[8691.36 - 8695.76] P:1942.22 E:0.087402 |  Dunga in 1994 doing that job so that Kappu could go flying.
[8695.76 - 8698.88] P:1870.01 E:0.095200 |  And then at the last, when they won the World Cup in 2002, Mark,
[8698.88 - 8701.04] P:1859.37 E:0.099397 |  they had the magnificent Gilberto Silva.
[8701.04 - 8705.92] P:1935.15 E:0.083079 |  Tonight, Tim pointed out very early on Fernandinho all over the place.
[8705.92 - 8708.16] P:1917.03 E:0.087274 |  That wasn't the Fernandinho we see from Ant City, was it?
[8708.16 - 8710.72] P:1923.61 E:0.096772 |  Even Luis Costavo, who in the last episode,
[8710.72 - 8714.16] P:1924.55 E:0.082660 |  what a big miss he's going to be, was non-existent tonight.
[8714.16 - 8716.88] P:1930.37 E:0.090441 |  All the talk is about playing three holding midfield players.
[8716.88 - 8718.56] P:1837.86 E:0.082863 |  They should have played five holding midfield players.
[8718.56 - 8721.04] P:2050.96 E:0.103196 |  And you quite rightly said that you felt that would be a danger,
[8721.04 - 8722.08] P:1996.94 E:0.092665 |  Marcelo, going forward.
[8722.08 - 8724.00] P:2024.61 E:0.099410 |  And you said, Julio, yes, he will get forward,
[8724.00 - 8727.44] P:1826.38 E:0.085010 |  but Luis Costavo will shuffle over and block off that avenue.
[8727.44 - 8729.04] P:1766.18 E:0.091767 |  It doesn't do it. It didn't happen, did it?
[8729.04 - 8730.00] P:1926.29 E:0.085238 |  It just didn't happen.
[8730.00 - 8732.08] P:1895.01 E:0.087918 |  I thought that Bernard was going to go on that side,
[8732.08 - 8734.32] P:1993.82 E:0.086107 |  and Hulk, who I saw at the times at the Olympics,
[8734.32 - 8736.56] P:1962.61 E:0.078034 |  sometimes would switch to the right-hand side.
[8736.56 - 8740.16] P:1974.92 E:0.085318 |  But I mean, Fred, no wonder poor old Fred got booed.
[8740.16 - 8742.64] P:2046.58 E:0.077483 |  I mean, he was anonymous.
[8742.64 - 8744.32] P:1947.50 E:0.066991 |  Hulk didn't get back.
[8744.32 - 8746.16] P:2016.59 E:0.072062 |  It was...
[8746.16 - 8748.56] P:2041.31 E:0.100167 |  Yeah, but Marcelo, when he plays like that for Real Madrid,
[8748.56 - 8750.48] P:2056.13 E:0.089629 |  has got Kedira, he's got Javier Alonso,
[8750.48 - 8752.64] P:1952.82 E:0.077462 |  he's got people like that protecting him.
[8752.64 - 8754.32] P:1952.82 E:0.096941 |  That just simply wasn't there this evening.
[8754.32 - 8757.04] P:1936.77 E:0.086019 |  There was talk at one stage of them playing all three,
[8757.04 - 8759.20] P:1944.20 E:0.086433 |  Fernandinho, Costavo and Paulinho.
[8759.20 - 8761.84] P:1886.84 E:0.087258 |  And then we were a little bit surprised that Bernard came in.
[8761.84 - 8764.48] P:1894.19 E:0.089826 |  And so whether Scolari now regrets not doing that,
[8764.48 - 8767.44] P:1920.76 E:0.070234 |  but the other two were just... They were bypassed.
[8767.44 - 8770.32] P:1922.04 E:0.098012 |  Let's hear from Juninho, the World Cup winner of 2002,
[8770.32 - 8772.24] P:1833.13 E:0.077179 |  who's just been talking to Jason Mohamed.
[8772.32 - 8774.64] P:1678.72 E:0.089263 |  Juninho, you know some of these players.
[8774.64 - 8776.88] P:1460.80 E:0.098378 |  That's a very good question the boys have been talking about
[8776.88 - 8779.52] P:1423.66 E:0.077002 |  in the studio. How do they recover?
[8779.52 - 8780.72] P:1529.06 E:0.092376 |  Well, it would be difficult.
[8780.72 - 8785.28] P:1268.49 E:0.076183 |  Some of them I don't think could be back to where the Brazilian shirt was.
[8785.28 - 8787.20] P:1471.05 E:0.075655 |  A lot of pressure on them.
[8787.20 - 8793.04] P:1306.25 E:0.081956 |  But it's wrong for us now, it's a great size, all the players.
[8793.04 - 8799.20] P:1438.24 E:0.075161 |  So we saw on the field, we saw German and Titios how to play football.
[8800.16 - 8801.84] P:1187.98 E:0.088987 |  We have to learn from that.
[8801.84 - 8808.24] P:1439.61 E:0.084420 |  We have to learn from the seven goals that we're concerned.
[8810.08 - 8813.20] P:1338.69 E:0.083589 |  The Germans played the way that we like to play,
[8813.20 - 8815.04] P:1313.70 E:0.071209 |  the way that we ever play.
[8815.68 - 8822.08] P:1400.64 E:0.074071 |  So we need now to sit back, see what's wrong with Brazilian football.
[8822.08 - 8823.12] P:1363.02 E:0.082426 |  Is something wrong?
[8824.24 - 8826.56] P:1187.94 E:0.071413 |  It's not because of these defeats.
[8826.56 - 8827.84] P:1189.03 E:0.066970 |  Is something wrong?
[8827.84 - 8833.04] P:1472.45 E:0.081234 |  Especially in the academy, the way that we cheat them to play.
[8833.04 - 8835.84] P:1350.93 E:0.086993 |  So there's a lot of change, I think we'll come.
[8837.60 - 8839.36] P:1889.02 E:0.103385 |  Just some more thoughts from Scolari.
[8839.36 - 8842.32] P:1846.83 E:0.092877 |  It's a catastrophe, the worst loss of a Brazil national team.
[8842.32 - 8844.40] P:1807.50 E:0.085140 |  We have to learn how to deal with this.
[8844.40 - 8846.72] P:1776.02 E:0.085885 |  And when it talking about the first half blitz of goals,
[8846.72 - 8848.72] P:1835.00 E:0.078795 |  he said it was like we blanked out.
[8848.72 - 8851.52] P:1605.81 E:0.087394 |  Rafa Honekstein, Rafa, it's a little bit of you that thinks,
[8851.52 - 8853.04] P:1639.91 E:0.081274 |  come on, give Germany some credit.
[8853.04 - 8854.32] P:1529.09 E:0.084615 |  It's all about Brazil, this.
[8854.64 - 8861.20] P:1646.85 E:0.076482 |  No, but the credit that Germany can take is that they exploited Brazil's problems today.
[8861.20 - 8862.24] P:1565.64 E:0.057181 |  And they did it beautifully.
[8862.24 - 8865.20] P:1350.08 E:0.089052 |  I looked at what Joachim Luf said in the press conference.
[8865.20 - 8869.60] P:1555.54 E:0.085617 |  He said that we knew that it would come at us with passion and with commitment.
[8869.60 - 8874.08] P:1408.86 E:0.086485 |  And we had to keep a cool head and resist that pressure and then take advantage.
[8874.08 - 8878.00] P:1491.70 E:0.085454 |  And what was so surprising is that after that first goal, Germany scored,
[8878.00 - 8880.24] P:1567.61 E:0.088288 |  you still think there's 18 minutes for Brazil.
[8880.24 - 8881.76] P:1304.55 E:0.072656 |  Don't open up.
[8882.16 - 8883.12] P:1235.31 E:0.084877 |  Don't open up.
[8883.12 - 8885.44] P:1528.62 E:0.087656 |  Don't start running all forward like headless chicken.
[8885.44 - 8890.80] P:1262.25 E:0.088312 |  I mean, this is a Scolari Brazil to be so open, so without any discipline,
[8890.80 - 8893.92] P:1472.22 E:0.085309 |  tactically, you know, it almost doesn't matter individually.
[8893.92 - 8896.64] P:1241.99 E:0.091231 |  You can point at all players and saying this is his mistake.
[8896.64 - 8897.68] P:1496.33 E:0.071476 |  That's that mistake.
[8897.68 - 8900.32] P:1425.82 E:0.082584 |  But the whole positioning collective, it was all over the place.
[8900.32 - 8902.48] P:1542.00 E:0.087056 |  And Germany in the end found it easy.
[8902.48 - 8906.00] P:1538.39 E:0.086993 |  And you saw if you give them a bit of space, then the automatism,
[8906.00 - 8909.36] P:1630.97 E:0.087810 |  as we say in Germany, they kick in people in Norway, Chavarra.
[8909.36 - 8911.92] P:1449.34 E:0.084432 |  They play nice one and twos without looking up.
[8911.92 - 8915.28] P:1487.92 E:0.082927 |  The lightness that wasn't there in this tournament so far came back.
[8915.28 - 8917.60] P:1612.57 E:0.096049 |  But it came because Brazil allowed them to do it.
[8917.60 - 8919.68] P:1536.51 E:0.075043 |  And you have to praise Germany.
[8919.68 - 8920.96] P:1683.42 E:0.068952 |  Of course you do.
[8920.96 - 8922.64] P:1352.25 E:0.085728 |  But Brazil made it easy for them.
[8922.64 - 8925.68] P:1412.04 E:0.094559 |  And I think Germany, that that will be the message that Germany themselves
[8926.32 - 8928.08] P:1609.16 E:0.084912 |  will be telling for the next few days.
[8928.08 - 8929.44] P:1697.43 E:0.096768 |  Don't get carried away.
[8929.44 - 8931.84] P:1642.98 E:0.073152 |  Don't think you're any of the world champions.
[8931.84 - 8935.68] P:1686.26 E:0.083167 |  We played beautifully, but we were allowed to do that.
[8935.68 - 8939.36] P:1588.95 E:0.083220 |  And whoever will play is not going to make life so easy for us.
[8939.36 - 8940.56] P:1497.64 E:0.069943 |  And just roll over.
[8940.56 - 8941.84] P:1603.06 E:0.096673 |  Rafa, thank you very much, Anil.
[8941.84 - 8942.88] P:1908.48 E:0.097140 |  Giulio, thank you.
[8942.88 - 8944.00] P:1815.04 E:0.086484 |  Mike, Danny, Anil.
[8944.00 - 8944.64] P:1588.88 E:0.083208 |  Thank you very much.
[8944.64 - 8948.96] P:1754.22 E:0.089499 |  We'll be in Sao Paulo tomorrow night for Argentina against the Netherlands.
[8948.96 - 8951.12] P:1947.47 E:0.087816 |  The winners, of course, to play Germany.
[8951.12 - 8954.48] P:2051.51 E:0.087273 |  A night here in Belo Horizonte that shocked the World Cup.
[8955.12 - 8957.92] P:2048.74 E:0.089932 |  And now Germany have scored seven.
[8957.92 - 8962.48] P:2029.28 E:0.091203 |  And it is the heaviest defeat in Brazil's illustrious history.
[8962.48 - 8969.20] P:2041.65 E:0.093549 |  And the herd continues on a night when the nation of Brazil is totally humiliated.
