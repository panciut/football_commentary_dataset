 It lives up to its expectation as referee Anthony Taylor gets us underway and Germany go downfield immediately with a ball that is headed away by Leynall Mann. They are in all white, they're playing from left to right as we look. Spain defending the end where the majority of those red shirts here in this Stuttgart arena, it holds 54,000. The top tier is suspended underneath the canopy style roof, it's actually made of fabric. We've been sitting here and it is quite an oppressive heat in this arena in Stuttgart as Marata tries to link up with Williams coming in off this left touch line and then there is Rudiger to Kimmich. The top scorers in the competition are Germany with 10, it's a joint national record. But Spain have been so dynamic as Williams plays a low ball in. Marata pulls it back, Petri with a shot left but it straight annoy it. A couple of touches already by Marata have been absolutely fantastic. They've come up to him, he's not able to hold it, he's touched it so good he's laid it back into his midfield and he's got three players running on there in the light of Nicaragua and Jamal and Petri that are going to go and hit anything. Just a moment before that it's what the interest is to see, there's something major going on off the field, off the ball between Sani and Cucarrea and it happened in the first seconds. There have already been three coming together between those two players. We've only been playing a minute, tell you what, this should be interesting. We'll see a little bit of a look at this again. First of all, I also was adived by Chan, which the referee told me he got for and in actual fact Cucarrea stayed down. And to be honest, not for the first time in this tournament, I have no idea why Cucarrea stayed down. But Cucarrea went down holding his face, his face wasn't even touched. No idea, to be honest, when unique all out players when they're doing that, throwing themselves to the ground in the next tournament, he's went to the ground so easily, that Chan dived, full stop, he dived. Cucarrea went over top, pretended to be poleaxing the face, not touched, keeping an eye on him. Him against Sani there, I think that'll be tasty. That was a warning shot though by Spain, that Petri effort was timed at 56 seconds. Yeah, the way it played up to Murata is really suited to this style. When it played in the English game, a lot of bulls played up in the air too. Now he's good at attacking bulls from crosses, but bulls is played up in the air. I mean, Tar and Rudegard are going to give them a tough time, but to feet is technically superb. Ball from Fabian goes out of play, too far ahead of Cucarrea. What a bumper weekend we have for you on BBC Radio 5 Live. The Euros, all four of the quarterfinals, Wimbledon, the Rugby Union Test match tomorrow morning, New Zealand against England, kick off at five past eight, the British Grand Prix, all on five live and BBC sounds. As Gunduan tries to touch the ball into the path of Sani on this right-hand side, Le Normand turns and puts it out of play for a German throw. Niel Niel in the early stages, three minutes played. Sun shining and those Spanish supporters away towards our right are having to shield the Sun from their eyes behind the goal of Oona Simon. As Kymik with a throw to Sani down the line, back towards Kymik. Sani tries to take it, shrugs off the challenge of Cucarrea. Rodgerie, oh, gross, taking out Pedri. Anthony Taylor comes under pressure from both sets of players. He tells them to move away, but Pedri was caught. You'd be stunned. I don't think he's going to bring his yellow card out there, and I'm amazed by that, because he completely mis-times it and he wipes it away completely. That is the clearest yellow card you're going to see. He's really wiped them out there. I mean, he's down and he's not acting. He's been taken out, a really bad one. Might have a dead leg just above his knee. And Anthony Taylor, and he's not reached with his yellow card yet, and you just wonder sometimes with the home crowd, the biggest name, is there something in that because anyone else, they've reached the card out, don't they? Well, Luis Stella Fuente, the 63-year-old head coach of Spain, is having to be appeased by Ivan Krusliak, the Slovakian who's the fourth official. Now, he takes no nonsense. You might recall he took charge of an Aston Villa tie in Europe. I think he was at Lille. And all the Spanish substitutes are saying that the gesturing wears the card. And Krusliak has told them to sit down and be quiet. Pedri will certainly have a dead leg, because he was taken out. Really high. And it was so high. It's quite... I'm not suggesting it was deliberate. I actually don't think it was, particularly if there ever... But it was dangerous. And he left his leg kind of hanging there, and it just wiped him out. So, you know, the referee's got a decision to make now. What if there's another one just the same as that? Is he going to let that go? No action taken by Anthony Taylor. Pedri is back on the field of play. You're listening to five live, five minutes play. Rodgery clips the ball on up towards Williams, near side the left. Takes it on the inside of Kimmich, rolls it towards Rodgery. He was fouled. And on this occasion, referee Anthony Taylor blows his whistle, gives Spain the free kick. You can hear what the German supporters think about that decision. And now it's taken quickly by Spain. Out to La Mena, Mal, this exciting teenager. Skips inside one challenge, passes the ball in field. He's gone down, saying he was fouled. There's a little bit of niggle already creeping into this game. Six minutes in. It's a very hard game to referee because it's so tight, because players have been pressed all over the field. And there's a lot of tackles going in. And another player down holding his face this time. Petri. Petri can't continue. And you have a look at the Spanish Benz. They're absolutely fuming at this. And to be fair, it may have looked really, really rough. I'm totally stunned that that initial one wasn't a yellow card. He's tried to run it off here, but I'm trying to see if he's actually got anything else. He's hit, but I tell you what, that's Jamal being done there. He says he's first to do it again. Not saying it's deliberate, but you know, there's referees that get the cards out for that as well. So Petri's done it again. Danny Olmo's going to be coming on. There was a lot of speculation leading up to this game that he should have replaced Petri. He retained his place. He stood the youngster from Barcelona, but he's the victim of a heavy challenge by Tony Crows. He's tried to shrug it off, and then he's gone down and he's sitting down, and he's going to have to come off the field of play. Yeah, it's a typical one, and every referee will deny this completely. But you can't come out with a game plan if you're at it as well. You don't want to get a yellow card early on. You want to calm the game down a little. You also want to let it flow a little bit. But sometimes you need to make a decision now, and I'm just not convinced he got that one right. And the players are now angry. They're going to love it. Catch you about it as well. Maybe I'll have lost a player off the field. And I do have a suspicion that maybe if it wasn't Tony Crows, if there had been somebody else, the temptation would have forgotten the yellow card out. Well, Petri is on his feet, but he's hobbling badly, and seven minutes into this contest here in Stuttgart, he is going to be replaced. The family and friends of each of the sides competing in this tournament tend to sit just behind the dugouts, and that small pocket of red down beneath us here behind the Spanish bench are all rising to their feet and giving Petri a standing ovation. As he does struggle, at least he can walk, but he's hobbling quite badly. He's embraced now by Dani Olmo, who of course plays his football in Germany for Leipzig. They finished fourth in the Bundesliga this year, and Dani Olmo comes on to replace Petri, but Petri is now being consoled by his substitutes, his teammates in the green bibs, as he makes his way back onto the bench. So, Germany give the ball back to Spain, sportingly, Chan chips it long, downfield to Unai Simon, and after that lengthy stoppage here in the sunshine in Stuttgart, five live and BBC sounds, we're back underway at 0-0. It's been a better stop-start, obviously, but what I was wanting to see at the start of the game is whether the Germans would be as offensive, or would they sit off slightly, because you know the Spanish are not going to do that. The Germans are. They're trying to stand up to them, punch for punch, and they don't, I mean, they're physically violent, I mean, they want to attack as much as they can as well, but let's hope there's a little bit more flow to the game there, unless three kicks than there's been so far. Certainly a stop-start nature to the proceedings here in Stuttgart, Rudiger. When you see Spain in the flesh, the one thing that has really struck me is their work rate off the ball. Here is Williams. A couple of occasions the other day against Georgia in Cologne, they had four red shirts snuffing out, potential Georgian counter-attacks, and Germany being pressed by Fabian, Rudiger to Kimmich with Williams putting him under pressure, cleared long by Rudiger, up towards Sane, bounces in field, Yamal clips it first time, Marata will give chase, and that ball is going to go out of play, and it will be a Spain throw on this near side, in front of their balled headed coach, De La Fuente. Very, very smart, suave and sophisticated, with his crew-neck T-shirt and his suit jacket. Of course, he's wearing the customary black and white pumps as the referee, Anthony Taylor, will say this will be a free kick to Germany. It was an offside, yeah, it was an offside just before that, and the bell's up. But it's funny that because it did start very, very quickly, but because of those negligible fills, and purely because each player was closing everybody else down very quietly, it's kind of not gotten to his rhythm yet, but you can see the Spanish, yeah, so high up the field, they really want to press on them. Ball played out by Tart, Mussialla on the stretch, couldn't get there on the halfway line, picked up by Gunduan, he's got a round going on ahead of him, Dagelborn in field will reach Haberts, Sane in back takes over, there is Haberts, plays it back out towards Rahm, Rahm drives it left from that left footed, and into the arms of Una Simon, who bolted out straight away towards Williams, Ruder Gido stepped out of defence and had it covered, and all of a sudden, Germany now being urged on. They're inside the Spanish half, but that ball out towards Rahm was unable to be controlled, and it's gone out of play for a throw, Nil Nil Patnevin. Nico Wownes has been brilliant in this tournament so far on the left wing, for the Spanish, but he's got to keep a shot there, gave him a 50-50 with Tony Rudiger, and nobody wants that, generally, but you don't want an early in a game anyway. So Rudiger won the ball there, but both teams wanted close to him, there was a moment just before there, Haberts was on the tongue, and that little tunnel they had the other night, which was one of the best I've seen in the tournament so far, he tried that one again, didn't quite come off the same way. There is Williams for Spain on this near side of the left, Cucarera just over the halfway line, La Porte, Fabian, plays it first time, Cucarera back in field now to the midfielder from Paris Saint-Germain, Charme will go towards him, just strokes it back to Le Normand, Carvajal is out wide over on that far side, Carvajal patiently playing it across the back, our Spain here in Stuttgart, five-live, still goalless between the two, as Le Normand, edging his way slowly but surely towards the halfway line. The Wimbledon coverage continues on Sports Extra, as here is Fabian to Williams, Cucarera coming forward on the near side, Williams goes it alone, right footed, and dragged it well off target, and that will be a goal kick, Neil Mill. There are some players that are just that much more special when they see them in the flesh, and Fabian's vision is absolutely fantastic, I mean, he's getting close to some of those greats in the last 10, 20 years ago, and there's another stoppage in play here, isn't it? You're absolutely right, it's getting a bit niggly. Is that Nico Williams having a little bit with Kimmich? Yep. It's happening off the ball, so it's hard to see, and he's just left his body there, where Kimmich is kind of kicked through it. Yeah, it's a foul, isn't it, vicious? There's nothing really to buy a bit. But can I sort of show that earlier on, a lot about physicality, letting each other know that they are very old-skilling, anyways. Again, no take, action taken from Anthony Taylor. Later on tonight, we've got the next quarterfinal for you live from Hamburg, Portugal against France. There's Gunduan, he's caught in possession by La Mignamal, his Barcelona teammate, Marata, placing inside, Olmo trying to get through, Olmo taken out by Rüdiger. Rüdiger's on a yellow card, incidentally. If he gets shown here, he will miss the semi-final, should Germany progress, and indeed, the Real Madrid defender will be ruled out of any last four appearance. Show the yellow, the first yellow card of the game by Anthony Taylor, Rüdiger suspended for the semi-final. Well, that's a big, big moment for Germany. Can you hear the sound of a marmer around the stadium? Either worried about the free kick he's given away, which is only 20 yards out, very dangerous position, but everyone in here knows that Rüdiger's going to miss the next game if they get through. And how similar was it to the tackle that Tony Cross wasn't booked for? As I said, some people get booked for some chavicles, and the same tackle, someone has got to leave with it. The imposing, aggressive central defender of Anthony Rüdiger will be missing the semi-final. Now, this is a free kick for Spain, direct free kick, right of the deep. Is it Olmo off the right foot or the left foot of La Mignamal? The youngest ever player in the history of the European Championship. Germany have got every white shirt back inside the penalty area. It's Olmo, he leaves it for Yamal, strikes it, takes the deflection of Target, and it will go out for a goal, kick, nil, nil. He's went below the wall, expecting a jump. They haven't got the player below the wall, so he's waiting for them to jump. They do jump, but he doesn't quite get it on Target. He's not lacking in confidence for a 16-year-old, is he? No. Pretty impressive. He's actually started beautifully in this game. He glides past players so fabulously. He's 16 years and 358 days old, as Gundue makes ground on that far side to left. Havertz and Sane are up with him. He finds Sane, central position outside the D, touches the ball to Kroos. He was caught late from behind. Williams brings the ball away. Germany protest, Spanish counterattack. Spanish counterattack. Yamal over the halfway line. Olmo, Morato's pit. Morato's peeled out to this left-hand side. Thought Olmo would overrun that ball. He just finds Morato, Morato shoots. That's charged down by Chan. And then it rebounds up towards the halfway line. Le Porte with a flick with his leg, headed on by Rodgery. 15 minutes played, still nil-nil, live on five live ambivisie sounds. But the most notable dash limits between the teams is, when the Spanish players run with the ball, the Germans can't get near them. They're just flying by them. So you've seen these tackles going flying. As I see it, Ramm tries to get into Yamal there. And they're doing everything to stop him now. They are very, very worried about the dribbling from the Spanish. Havertz, Mussiola, who's been quiet, collects the ball, goes out to the left touch line, midway through the Spain half. Ramm on the overlap. He finds him left-hand side, looks for the cutback. And with a couple of deflections, it's scooped up inside his six-yard area by Unoi Simon, 16 minutes played, nil-nil. Juno's always really good when you see Wenger's playing. I would say that, but Zane, Mussiola, Nico Williams, who's looked really lively. And Yamal as well, who's probably been the pick of them so far in this game. Here is Yamal on that right-hand side. Fabian finds some space, looks for a shooting opportunity. Left footed, couldn't keep it down, just outside the D off target. I don't think he should shoot there. I know he's 20 yards out, and he's actually scored in the tournament so far. But there is an overlap outside him to his left. Morata's looking at him to say, oh, just passed him in, it's 2-1, 2-1. If Nico Williams widens me here, we'll be through in the goalkeeper. But he got a little bit carried away there, Fabian, and put it over the crossbar. So if you were to judge this game in quarters, who'd been playing for 16 and a half minutes, you'd give the first quarter the space. So far, yeah. Not quite the full quarter of the game gone yet, but Spain at the moment look the more dangerous. That's not to say there aren't dangers. And we've not seen Moussiala run at his defender yet, and he's up against Carvajal. He's got a few years in him, you know, he's got the pace of him. But many players have the pace of Carvajal, and don't get much out of him. Here is Rudiger. He wants Kimmich to go a little bit further forward on this near side, the right. Kimmich midway through the Spain half, all in white, remember Germany. Now in field to Chan, former Liverpool midfielder. Gunduan is just ahead of him. Back to Kroos, in between the two central defenders. Havertz comes deep. In the shadows of the main stand here in the Stuttgart Arena. As the German support created a bit noise inside this 54,000 capacity arena. Kroos waits, Rudiger is to the side of him. Spain have got everybody back inside their own half. Marata tries to close down Kroos. To Jonathan Tahr. Kroos now takes over with the outside of his right boot, spreads it out towards the left background. Got a couple of touches to take it forward. Into the sunshine now he is with Mussiala. Mussiala on that left touch line, back towards Gunduan. Nice, gentle pace though by Germany. Kroos looking to dictate. Tahr. Havertz again. Just dropping off the two central defenders a little bit, not necessarily playing on their shoulder. There's Kimmich to Sane. Low ball into the box, stretching to keep it from going behind. There's Laporte. He concedes a throw though, 10 yards up from the corner flag, near side the right that Kimmich will take quickly. Rudiger back with Jonathan Tahr. Sustained spell of pressure from Germany. Probably the first time that they've actually had that. Offside against Kimmich on this near side. And Mussial, the assistant referee gets his flag up very, very early. They're doing generally do that. He seemed very confident because the player was right beside them and I think he's spot on with that one. So I'm not going to complain about that. But it's as if the Germans are starting, you know, play really quick at the beginning and see how the Spanish can cope there. And it's kind of, oh actually, that's not a good idea. We better control this more. And you can see the Germans saying, no, no, let's control the game. Get the ball to Jan and Kroos, particularly in that central midfield there. And build it up slowly. Whereas the Spanish, they'd love to lift the tempo. Germany lost the first meeting to Spain on German soil back in 1935 in Cologne. They've been unbeaten in their last nine since. As this is the fourth meeting between the two at the Euros. Spain, who really came through a tough group. Group B winners navigating their way past Croatia, Italy and Albania. The only side, of course, with a 100% winning record in this competition. As Kimmich floats it forward, headed away by Le Nommand. Edge of the area, Rodgery trying to get away from Sane. Mussialas there, Cham stabs it back to Tar. And Ramm on that far side, back with Tar once again. His forward ball to Mussiala. Just had to accelerate away from Lameen Yamal. Keeps the ball though for Germany. And now it's with Kroos and Cham. There's a man over on that far side. It's David Ramm, but Gunduan spins. And Kimmich is joining the attack on this near side, the right. And his diagonal ball along the ground finds him. And Kimmich chips the ball into the penalty area. And Hamerts with a header saved by Ulo Simo. I mean, he got up really well there. The pearls are down as much as he possibly can. But there is no pair on the cross. He's given it everything. He's tonned his head. He's caught it perfectly. But because it's a floated cross, and he cannot get off on it. And it's an easy one for Sinon to deal with. But the first and best chance so far for the Germans. It remains 0-0. Ball goes direct from Simo down to Dani Almo, who at the minute is playing almost through the middle. Because Lameen Yamal has gone out to the right. Marata is at the moment to the left. And Williams has actually gone into a much more deeper role. Nico Williams for the time being. It remains 0-0 here in Stuttgart. 21 minutes played. Rodgery wins the ball in the midfield. Fabian will play it back to Leynor Mann. Let's get another update from Wimbledon, Ian Carter. Carlos Alcaraff, the defending champion in cruise control now. Eventually, 3 hours 42 minutes on the clock. But he's leading now with two breaks of serve in the deciding set. Against Francis Tiofo by four games to one. Thank you Ian. commentary continues on sports extra. As Simon just puts his foot on the ball a couple of times. Hits it right footed. Again looking for that ball down the middle. Rudergat who will miss the semifinals should Germany go through. After that yellow card after 13 minutes. Back then to Ettenoya who is today making a little bit of German history. He's the top appearance maker for Germany in major tournaments. With his 39th appearance beating the record set by, or held jointly by Bastian Schweinsteiger. Only Ronaldo has actually played more games in major tournaments than Manuel Neuer. In Manuel Neuer, what a servant he has been over the years. 38 now. There's the German support behind him in that goal. He can put them down in unison. It's the port. Drills one in from 25 yards out left footed. Saved at the second attempt. It remains goalless. Saved at the second attempt. I remember seeing that somewhere else quite recently. In Champions League semifinal. Now I made a mistake. But that's him he managed to recover it a little bit. I'm drinking the way it's gone here. You know, it's trying to be controlled by the Germans. But you're looking out there and if you're Spain you're thinking, Kimmy, brilliant player, but not blessed with a huge amount of pace anymore. He's getting on a lot a bit. Ram, good feel by it. But again, not absolute lightning pace. And you look at the pace that's out wide for that Spanish team. They got together those winners. A bit more of the ball further up the field. You can see though there is a respect between the two sides, isn't there? Absolutely. Funny because they understandably, we got a bit excited at the start of the game and tackles the flying end. There's about 100mph stuff. It has settled a little bit now and they're maybe slightly over respectful for the last three or four minutes. Here is Rudiger, short of the halfway line. Round was just starting to go off on a run on that far side. Every time he goes forward, he takes Laminio Malt back with him. As the move breaks down on this near side, a ball towards Kimmy, too far ahead of him. It'll be a Spain throw midway through their own half. You look actually at the last four meetings at major tournaments. Spain have won two, they've drawn two. But only six goals scored between them. So I guess maybe it was always going to be a tight contest here. As Sane gets momentarily away from Cucaraya. Kimmick helps out, the Rattery's back leans into Kimmick. That was a foul and it will be a free kick to Germany, just in from the right touch line on this near side. Senefovos tackle there, there's no use at all. He's just shoved them off. Kimmick knows what he's doing, he's pitched his body in the way. But to give a free kick away, when Kimmick's going lower, he's just going into the corner. Silly free kick to give away. When you consider the power of Tar, Rudiger, Havertz in the middle there, he's got a great chance to put it in from a dangerous area here. And those players that Pass has mentioned, along with Gunduan, are lurking as four white shirts inside the penalty area. Sane have every red shirt back inside the box. Anthony Taylor, the English referee, is just having a word with Jonathan Tar. There is an air of expectation and anticipation here inside the Stuttgart Arena. It's crosed with a delivery, right footed. Rudiger climbs as does Tar. And then that header just drops down off Tar and is picked up. And then lobbed out by the right hand of Uno Simon. And Williams is a judge to a foul David Raum. And that will be another free kick to Germany, midway through the Spaniard. Very, very straight through, wasn't it? I think he was caught in two mains as he threw the ball out there. But what they wanted to, is when they get the ball from deep to Spanish, they know that the white players have got better pace than their opponents, with the exception of Rudiger who's central. So he's trying to get out to those white areas, but quite simply the ball wasn't on there. So this free kick must be 15 yards into the Spain half. 10 yards in from the left touch line on that far side. Gross eventually is going to place the ball down, just spins it. Takes a couple of steps back. Quite a high line though, this from Spain with their red shirts. Just outside the deep. So there's a lot of protection there for Uno Simon. As it goes deep, Le Porte stretching. Does it touch his head? Yes, it does. It'll be a corner kick to Germany. Very good with their corner kicks in the free kicks of Germans. Very noticeable in the last game they scored one. It was chopped off because of a very, very obvious block. But on that occasion, I kept an eye on Rudiger. He must have made a 30-yard run, knowing exactly where the ball was going to end up. He was unlucky not to get in the end of it, but they have got a corner. So this should be an out-stringing corner from Tony Cross on this near side, the right. Rudiger is trying to get away from Le Normand. The referee's got to split the two of them for the time being. Havert, Tahr, Chan are all lurking. Inside the six-yard box, you've got Gunduan in there. Kimmich in there too. And it comes now. Tahr tries to get on the end of it. Chan heads it, Goldwoods and Uno Simon, after stumbling over a couple of German players, literally takes it off the head of Gunduan and throws it out. And now it's with Fabian for Spain. Waits for the running, supporting run of Kukereya to his left. Trots his way towards the halfway line. 27 minutes played. Rodgery, he passes the ball forward. Williams is onto it. Sane's the one who backpedals. Williams goes on the outside, ships the ball to the far post. And Raum should clear this with La Mignamal in pursuit. Calva Halber with the interception. And then he was chopped from behind. And it'll be a free kick to Spain. And Anthony Taylor is going to show another yellow card. Incorrect again. Absolutely. And the Germans are getting possibly rough house tactics now. They're going into his tackles. And if you don't win the ball, you know how to keep on going through. And he's straight through. Actually, it's one of those ones. I just don't think his feet are quicker off. He's tried to get the man and he's just wept out Calva Halber. And he's not going to stand on his feet. Just before that, Niko Williams gets his first opportunity. They're defending the final thought effortless. Gets to the byline. And after a five, six, seven minute good period for the Germans, they're under pressure again. Raum then shown a yellow card. The second German player to be booked by Anthony Taylor. Free kick to Spain level with the penalty area far side to right. Twenty-eight minutes played, still goalless. Yamal threatens to take it, leaves it for Williams. It's curling in now up towards Rodgery, headed away by Gross. Only as far as Olmo. He's then tried to hit it and he's missed it. And by actually catching Gunduan in the process, Gunduan's hobbling his back on his feet, tries to stamp off the effects of that challenge. It'll be a free kick to Germany. Yeah, I think his referee's got that one right. Gets a lot about the ball. And almost just trying. He doesn't see the tackle coming in. It's a free kick. Absolutely nothing more than that. Well, you consider that Petri had a low shot for Spain after 56 seconds. He's since left the field through an injury to be replaced by Olmo. And Neuer is saved from Le Porte's low drive. Simon saved from a Havertz header. And that's been about it as we approach the half-hour mark. Ball goes astray. Gunduan on to it. Then he was caught by Le Normand. Le Normand could be in trouble here. Because if he's shown a yellow card, he'll be suspended. And there it is. The first Spanish player to get a booking. And like Rudiger, the central defender for Spain. If Spain progress, we'll be banned for the semifinal. Awful decision. Terrible decision. He's just come out close to him behind him. And he's thrown himself to the ground there at the very, very most, a free kick. And he's just going to play it a possibility, a semifinal for that. That's a very pro decision. Nil Nil. 15 minutes to go to half-time. Kroos. Kymik. Passes the ball back to the halfway line for Jonathan Tarr. This tall central defender. He won the title for Bayer Leibacuzn in their sensational season that they had here. Back with Tarr once again. Just coming back from a ban. So he missed that last 16 encounter against Denmark. As the ball is forward. And now with Tarr out towards that far side. And they're building. Round on the left-hand side. Close down by Carvajal. Gets away. Edge of the area. Chan to the edge of the box. Chan loses his balance. Spain can't keep the ball. Played back by Tarr. Sane right corner of the box. Headed away by Carvajal. It's a throw to Germany. Which Kymik will take quickly. They try and keep that momentum going. With 14 minutes to go to half-time. Kymik on this near side. Havertz waits. Kymik. Passes the ball in field. Tarr forward of the centre circle. Back with Rudiger once again. Spain just trying to keep that high line as Sane. Back by the buoyant German support. Kymik though held up by Fabian. Towards Croes. They're trying to prise their way. Passed the Spanish side. Tarr steps forward. Forward of the centre circle. Gets the ball back by Chan. Passes it now to Gunduan. Gunduan to Mussiala. And now all of a sudden there's a break on for Spain. La Mena Malo over on that far side. He's over the halfway line. And then he's fouled. Let's get an update from Ian Carter at Wimbledon. Carlos Alcaraft safely through the defending champion. Coming through a five-setter. Three and three-quarter hours on court against France's TFO. But in the end he did it. Five, seven, six, two, four, six, seven, six, six, two. Next up on centre, Emma Radacana. Regular updates here on Five Live and BBC South. The tennis coverage continues on Sports Extra. Chan was not booked for that challenge on La Mena Malo. Yeah, it's getting a wee bit bizarre. I don't think Anthony's having his best day out there. How he can book for Le Mans, Le Mans for what he done. And then not book Chan for that. It's utterly beyond me. Utterly beyond me. It seems really strange. If you're Spanish just now watching this, you'll be very confused and very angry. The sun continues to shine in Stuttgart. It remains 0-0 with 12 minutes to go to half-time. Very cagey affair here. As Le Mans, Carvajal on the halfway line. Pushing the ball past Mussiala. Round-o. Quickly dealt with it. Wins the ball back for Germany. Carvajal, though, chases and hassles. And Harris, his Real Madrid teammate, Anthony Rudiger. But they try and beat the press from Spain. Keeping the ball at the back. Cross, of course, an integral part. Once again, just linking up the play. Rudiger to Kimmich, held up by Williams. And then just strokes it back. Mussiala's had a quiet game so far. Just can't go into the ball. If you're a wide player, you need to get the ball in the final third. Preferably one-on-one at half a chance. You won't get that many opportunities, but you've got to take them, but he's not had one yet. Marata forward, ball towards Olmo. Sliding was tart and did just enough to see it back towards Neuer. There was just a glimpse of an opening, maybe, for Dani Olmo. That's just something slightly more sprightly about the Spanish. You're a little bit sharper about Spanish. That's not to say that the Germans are lumping, but they need to control this. They need to use their physicality, and they have doing so. Here is Havertz. Can't get past Rodgery. Referee almost gets in the way. Havertz, though, with Chan. Kimmich had gone into a rolling field on the edge of the area. Now has to go out wide. Here is Kimmich, plays it in low. Seamon wouldn't have counted. Flag was up on this near side, and it will be... Like that, the referee will just let play continue with it. Unai Seamon with the ball at his hands, and it is still 0-0, just over 10 minutes to the break. It was a special play by Havertz, wasn't it? He held up so well. Everyone was coming through. He was almost playing as a 10. He does that, false nine quite a lot himself. Lovely play, and Kimmich had just made the run a little bit too quickly. We'll be hearing from Gareth Southgate a little later on. But all the latest from the England camp on the Football Daily Podcast, ahead of that quarterfinal tomorrow in Düsseldorf, live on 5 Live, and BBC sounds from 5 o'clock. England against Switzerland. And indeed, the Rugby Union Daily, likewise ahead of New Zealand, England in the first test, which you can hear at 5 past 8 tomorrow morning, on BBC Radio 5 Live. What a bumper day of live sport tomorrow. Rudiger goes long, searching ball. Havertz off his chest. Havertz with the shot right footed. Unai Seamon with the save, away to his right. Movements brilliant, isn't it? How about... It does exactly what I said before, what should do. Runs wide, and as soon as he's slightly over-covered, he comes inside again and finds himself with a couple of yans there. Doesn't catch it clean, but that's two half-decent chances. He's got himself with great movement, but it has to be said, not great. Finish him. 10 minutes to go to the break. The voice of Pat Nevin with us here in Stuttgart, as La Porte gets away from Sarne. Accelerates with Sarne now running back at him, and La Porte has carried that ball midway through the Germany half. Marathe plays it out towards Yamal. Yamal enters the penalty area. Yamal twisting and turning. I mean, in the end, he probably bamboozled himself to the 16-year-old. He's pushed off the ball by Rao. The German supporters like that. His clearance will be fixed up by Kuker Air inside the centre circle. He'll defend the lovesack. He's in seed, he's boxed, he cannot dive in there. He just waits for the movement from the winger on Yamal. And he does run too much, but he shouldn't get downhearted about that. He's looked dangerous. Olmo finds Williams round the back, opens up for Williams, and Neuer makes the save at his near post. Flags up again. Yeah, but they're coming so close, aren't they? Every time they play a ball wide, the Spanish look dangerous. That one was very, very tight indeed. The assistant referee's got it right most of the time up until now. Not so sure about that one. I think that's when you definitely tried the lines. You could not tell by the naked eye. What has Moussiala then got to do to get more involved? It's really hard though, because if you're playing in a system, you're asked, because most teams at the moment, if you're playing with wide players, you're told, get as wide as you can, stretch the game, develop the space. But if there's no one passing you to do that, you're stuffed. You'd like to come in looking for it, but if the system says you need to drag wide, you have no option, you need to do it until the ball comes to you. So far, him and, it has to be said, Zani as well. They've got very, very little ball in the last dug. Here is Cook Araya. Certainly when you contrast that to William Zanayamal. Yeah, and they've got a little bit of space to run into. The way that the Spanish are playing it, they play it so quick from back to front. It'll only be one or two passes, but it'll be done with such speed that they've got space to run into. As we are looking just now, look at the 40-50 yards between the back line and the Germans and the goalkeeper. That's great if you're a wide player with some pace to run into. Still awaiting the first goal and this first at the quarter finals. Maratta reacted there to Jonathan Tav. I think he was just slightly caught on the back of the head and he didn't like it. Meanwhile, it's Chan who's gone down. Maratta will just have a word with Anthony Taylor, but it's a free kick to Germany on the edge of their own centre circle. Maratta, be very careful. There's nothing very good towards the Spanish so far in the FAD. I mean, they should actually have both, they should have crossed. And Chan should be both booked. We know, definitely should both be booked. If you get two centre midfield players, both on yellow counts against pace, the players against them, that would be real danger. And as neither is booked. Olmo, Fabian in the centre circle for Spain, plays it out wide. That mop of dark hair of Cucaraya, who's held up by Sane, has to go back to La Porte. He can come forward over the halfway line for the red of Spain. Rebound, Fabian, first-time ball, finds Williams. Cucaraya has stayed out wide on the near side, links up with Williams. Left side of the penalty area now, seven minutes to go to half time. Cucaraya makes a darting run in from the left touch line. Williams though will run back in that space that Cucaraya has vacated. Williams still hasn't delivered the cross. Sane is back with him. Williams waiting. Rodgery helps out. Le Normand now forward of the centre circle, passes the ball out towards Fabian. Calvahal is on the inside of him. Here he is, touches the ball back to Fabian. Spain now is just starting to see a little bit more of the ball. They've only had 48% possession in this first half. As the Spanish supporters with the Olay, says Yomal. And those Olays are being drowned out by the whistles now of the Germany support here in Stuttgart. As the sun continues to shine, six minutes to go to the break. Williams keeps the ball in play, near side, up against Kimmich. Kimmich dives in and gets the challenge. Breaks towards Havertz. Kimmich's gone forward. Cucaraya though easily dispossesses Havertz. Olmo now is going to shape to shoot. Spilt by Neuer, comes out to Maratta. Can Maratta get a sight of goal? No, held up by Rudiger and then the rebound off the outstretch leg of Charlie is picked up by Neuer. It's a good hit, but Neuer's playing it back into the danger round here again. Again, we'll talk about that. He did it with Bayern Munich, very famous against Real Madrid. And this time, we're just seeing it again in Maratta's offside for the rebound. But if you're a goalkeeper, every goalkeeper tells me, when it's shot and you parry it to the side, not straight back to the danger. Actually, Mamadou Svili for Georgie did that with great effect the other night in Cologne with strong risks. As the ball has gone behind the advertising hoardings and it's taken a while for the ball boy or ball girl, it's so hard to see with that far away from the action in our commentary position here in the Stuttgart arena. But now with that throw, Moussiala finds round, cut out by Le Normand. Will lovely first touch by Olmo. Tar with the interception. There was Rodgery, Spain have it back, five minutes to go to halftime, 0-0. Along the ground towards Williams. Kymic was tight behind him. And Le Porte back in that central defensive area, squares it for his partner, Le Normand. Both of them French-born, Spanish internationals. 0-0, five live and BBC sounds. Wimbledon coverage continues on Sports Extra. It's just classically one of those games here. People want to take chances, but they only want to do it in the final third. There is a fear, in fact, there isn't. They're playing around at the back, no one's over-risking it from the back line there. You understand that, because if you make a mistake in this game, you give a goal away. There's every likelihood the one may make more goals. I do understand there was a certain uncertainty with one or two players. Rodgery in between the two central defenders who've split quite wide, passes it to Le Porte. Oonoz-Simon hits it low, Olmo has made that run, being tracked by Croce. Oh, somebody's spoken out of turn here. Anthony Taylor is having a word with Chan. It was fortunate he should have been booked earlier, and that was a clear bit of dissent, the way that Anthony Taylor's reacted. And yet Chan once again escapes the booking. It's kind of been an unusual referee in my foot. Look, it's not always an easy game, the referee. The quality plus all chance. Kukere looking for the pace of Williams. I don't think it was offside that time. And just shows you the pace you've got. You turn off for a millisecond against any of the three off-world wingers that are on this pitch just now. And you're stuffing it. It shows you what a tough gig it is for everyone that he's fullbacks. Talk to Eluron about the battle between Zani and Kukere. Kukere has played it really well so far, hasn't he? In fact, he's pushed Zani back further and further in getting into dangerous positions themselves, the chance he'll play. I thought about you. I can't recall an opportunity for either Mussiala or Zani. Maratta coming deep, showed good strength to hold off the challenge of Havertz. Forward ball, though, cut out by Round. Just squeezed in a little bit there to the left back in the shadows now of the other son here with three minutes to go to halftime. This is their first meeting since a 1-1 draw in the group stages of the World Cup in Qatar. Both the goals came in the second half. Maratta just passed the hour and full crook with a late equaliser, seven minutes from the end. But there is Rudiger just putting his foot on the ball, nobody moving. And it's become that sort of... It's like becoming a game of chess in many ways. I think it shouldn't be a real surprise now. I mean, there are slightly different systems that they play. That every player after about 10 or 15 minutes knows where his problem is and who he should be marking. And they're trying to create a lot of chaos now in the Spanish. Roderick did well to get away from Chan. Fines Williams left-hand side, Williams with the cross, Noy has got it covered as it goes over his head. He was calm and relaxed, his arms were open wide. There was no threat to the Germany goal as it's gone out of play for a throw on that far side. I'm not about to shame that, because it always was Williams' problem. There has been over a few years that he's been around that. No problem beating Flitz. No problem getting to the baseline. Sometimes the choice when you actually get there hasn't been absolutely perfect though. And this tournament so far, he has scored one absolute stonker of a goal, hasn't he? Was that against Georgia? It was. Oh, what a goal. Yeah, it was a fine finish. It was his first goal for Spain since they played Georgia back in September. But it was only his third for his country. Tonight is his 18th appearance for the 21-year-old, who scored eight goals in 37 appearances for Athletic Bilbao. He's got just over 60 seconds remaining. It remains 0-0 on BBC Radio 5 Live. Laporte. Kukereya. Kymik closes him down, back with Laporte. Two former Manchester City players there coming together, Asane. She uses him, passes it all the way back to Unai Simon, and his dark goalkeeping outfit. Bright white gloves, strikes the ball long, right footed. Carvajal, flick header. La Minha Mal hooks it back then to Carvajal, and then helped out by Kroos. And Germany then give the ball away, straight towards Rodgerie. This is Fabian. Kukereya is getting forward to the feet of Marata, plays it out to the right-hand side of the penalty area. La Minha Mal, Williams is there as is Olmo, tussling for the ball, Mussi Arla on defensive duties, digs it out, and Germany should clear with 30 seconds remaining. Goalless. It was pretty good defending that, there was a lock going on off the ball there, wasn't there? I mean, I have to say, I'm impressed with Marata. He's kind of, he's got a lot stronger, hasn't he? He's taken on Rudiger, very physically there, and not many people do that. And he's not doing a bad job of it so far. He scored the first goal in this campaign against Croatia in Berlin. That was a sharp turn by La Minha Mal, who shoots, but it lacked the power really. It bounced into the arms of Neuer, and it was straight at, and the keeper didn't really have to move too much. There is something extra special about Yamal, isn't there? When he gets the ball, he just slips past plays with such pace. You know, he's very young, and he made the wrong choice there. He shoots from about 25 yards there. We're now in actual fact, he can take another five or six yards there, but why is he impressive when he's on the ball? Williams is now over on that far side, the right. We're into two minutes of added on time, five live and BBC sounds. Yamal still on that far side, Carvajal behind him. Carvajal to Yamal, forward, holding the whip, there's Williams. Carvajal's made a run into the penalty area. Rodgeri just outside the box. This is Leynor Mande. Leynor Mande, I thought he was going to shoot from distance. Here is Rodgeri. They don't score goals outside the box in the Euros. There was a great debate, that goal from Rodgeri, was it inside the area, was it outside the area against Georgia? Up to ruled, it was inside. It means that their last 59 goals at the Euros have all come inside the penalty area. As Carvajal now is forward, Olmo to Carvajal, cleared by a very compact and narrow back four by David Rao. Spain no win the ball back. Rodgeri, can they find a way through in stoppage time? Kroos stops the run of Morata. Kroos forward ball to Gundawan, coming together between Kukareya and Gundawan. Gundawan has stayed down. I think Anthony Taylor tried to let the game flow. He's brought it back for a Germany free kick. That's one of those ones where it's tough one now. It's a hard call for the referee, because I think Gundawan makes sure he leaves his leg and in place where the defender's coming. So, yeah, there is contact there. It is a free kick. I don't think it's a great deal more than that, because Gundawan knows what he's doing there. Johnny Stapman, Johnny Blaine, who is a friend of the Monday nightclub, often gets a mention from Mark Chapman. He verified for me that that goal from Rodgeri was inside the area. Chris Sutton was a little skeptical. I know it's not like Chris, I know. Here is Rodger, two to Kimmich. And there indeed is the halftime whistle. Spain nil, Germany nil. Pat Nevin. I mean, a very interesting game in many ways. And I think it probably would have kicked on going at a better pace. Had the injuries and the problems right at the start of the game, with the free kicks and the injuries and the referee making some unusual decisions. It kind of slowed it down a little bit, and as you say, it's become very, very tactical after that. I think maybe the Spaniards are just nudging it with chances and looking slightly more dangerous. But there's so little in it, and you just know it's going to come down in one piece of absolute brilliance. The problem is, I guess, who that absolute brilliance is going to come from. Because there's so many capable of it in this field at the moment. But at the moment, not completely taken off yet, but a very intriguing game. And in this heavyweight contest, no side has managed to land a knockout blow just as yet. Halftime then, Spain nil, Germany nil. And Kelly, you're in Hamburg. I am indeed, yes, Ian Denison, Pat Nevin, bringing us that game between Spain and Germany. And Pat, for two teams, you've got so much talent on display. It's been pretty scrappy for the first 45 minutes. I think that was understandable from the Germans, because I think they realised early on that the sprightliness of the Spanish was going to cause them all sorts of problems. So there was a few hefty hits early on in the game. And I kind of made it a little bit bitty for a little bit too long. And you understand why the Germans are going to do that, because if they stand up and just play an open game, I think the Spanish probably will win this one. Because of the like, and the Nicol Williams and Jamal out in the wide areas, they just look fabulous. So, you know, understand why that happened, but you know, the game will open up. It's a very steamy atmosphere here. And because of that, one or two players get tired, a little bit of space will open up. And whether it will happen in the next 45, or indeed possibly the 30 after that, I don't know. But at some point, some of those players will get opportunities. Whenever it happens, and whichever side goes through, there could be players missing for either side, with the injury to Pedri, and with suspensions from players picking up yellow cards today. Yeah, Rodrigo's going to miss it. That's a massive one. He was obviously quite affected by that for about 10 or 15 minutes afterwards, because he wasn't going into any tackles. He was kind of holding off a little bit, obviously worried about being sent off in this game. But he's going to miss the next one. And he has been really core of that defence for quite some time now. Limitly, Norman, he needs to get his head together, because as far as I'm concerned, he's been booked for doing nothing wrong. And that's hard to take, knowing that if your team goes through, you've got a semi-final coming up, and you're not going to be able to play in it because of what was a very unusual decision by the referee. That's a tough line to take. But hey, that's tournament football. They go on with it, they deal with it, and they'll put it to the back of their minds. But you're absolutely right. It's not been the explosive game we hope for so far. But that doesn't mean it's not going to happen. I mean, I really do expect it will. And if any team scores early in the second half, I'm sure we'll have a cracker start to come. And Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis will bring you second half commentary from Stuttgart of Spain against Germany, nil nil there at halftime. As you said, we are here, and we are in Hamburg ahead of the late kickoff this evening. It's eight o'clock here in Hamburg, and we'll be bringing you coverage of what could be quite a tight game between Portugal and France. We'll have some build-up to that coming up. We'll also get the very latest from a busy day at Wimbledon after the BBC News with Richard Foster. The Voice of the UK. And the home of the Euros and Wimbledon. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thanks, Kelly. Good evening. Rachel Reeves has become Britain's first ever female chancellor, as Secure Sturma names his first cabinet after Labour's landslide election victory. She's been speaking at the Treasury and told staff she's aware of the challenges of the job. It comes with a great weight of responsibility. I embrace it. It will demand hard work. I am ready for it. The British people have put their trust in this new government. They've put their trust in us to run the economy and to protect their finances. And that trust must not be squandered. Angela Reina has been named Deputy Prime Minister. John Healy is the Defence Secretary, and Pat McFadden has been appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Evette Cooper is the new Home Secretary. She's been outlining her priorities outside the Home Office. Trying to get neighbourhood police back on our streets in our communities and also setting up the new Border Security Command to go after the criminal boat gangs that are organising the dangerous boat crossings. Our communities have faced damage and often felt fractured and sometimes brittle as well. And our task has to be to bring people back together. David Lamme is the new Foreign Secretary and says everyone wants to see an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He says he'll do all he can diplomatically to support Joe Biden in bringing about that ceasefire. And he's been setting out his key aims in government. I want to see a reset on Europe, a reset on our relationships with the Global South and a reset on climate. And I also want to see some gear shifts. Gear shifts on European security and on global security, given all the problems that we're seeing in the Middle East, but also I want to centre our foreign policy on British growth. In the past few minutes, Lisa Nandi has been promoted to Culture Secretary and Secure Starmer's top team after the previous holder of the brief, Thangam Debenair, lost her seat to the Greens. Reform UK have won another seat. They've just taken Basildon South and East Thuruk from the Conservatives, with a majority of just 98 votes over the Labour candidate. It takes reforms total to five seats, despite securing more than 14% of the vote share. Earlier, Nigel Farage was heckled at a news conference but said he'd campaigned for changes to the electoral system. If we had proportional representation, we'd be looking at nearly 100 seats. But equally, First Pass the Post inverts the other way. Where Labour get fewer votes, they got under Corbyn, and yet 200 more seats. It is very much my view that our outdated First Pass the Post electoral system is not fit for purpose, and we will campaign with anyone and everyone to change this electoral system. The Conservatives had their worst election result ever, and we're now looking for a new leader, after Rishi Sunak announced his resignation. He'll step down once the process of choosing a successor begins, and says he's heard the anger of the people. Dame Eleanor Lang is the former Conservative MP for Epping Forest. She told Five Live the Tories' next leader must have serious substance. There's been far too much discussion of late about trivia, instead of about principles. There has also been far too much talk about personalities. It isn't a game show. It's about people's lives, and it's about the future of this country. We have to have a leader who will have decent, honest, straightforward arguments with Keir Starmer. The Liberal Democrats will return to government at the third largest party in Parliament, with 71 seats. The party took the seats of two former Prime Ministers, David Cameron and Theresa May. And in Wales, almost all the seats went to Labour, leaving the Tories with no MPs at all there. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin has the most seats in Westminster, while the DUP lost three MPs. In the latest travel news, on the road to Ingrate Manchester, the M60 clockwise, one lane is closed at the moment, between Junction 13 at Wersley and the Swinton interchange. It's broken down vehicle, they're very heavy traffic, so expect delays. The M25 anticlockwise, two lanes are closed between Junction 17 and 16 at the M40. There's been an accident. Traffic is queuing as you approach that closure. Really long delays already, so it is going to be slow. And the M23 southbound, the exit slip road is partially blocked at Junction 11 at Pease Potage. That is causing a bit of a back up onto the main carriageway. It's a broken down lorry, so it's going to take a little while for that to clear. Ellie Brennan, five live travel. This is Five Live Sports with Kelly Kitts. Euro 2024, Deutschland. We're in Hamburg this evening for the eight o'clock kickoff between Portugal and France in the quarterfinals of Euro 24. Before that, we'll be back to Stuttgart for the second half of Spain against Germany. That one is nil nil at half time. And our coverage of Wimbledon continues on SportsAxtra. Let's head there now for an update. Ian Carter is on centre court, where reigning men's champion, Carlos Alcarath, had a titanic battle with Francis Tiafoeian. He really did. Tiafoe provided just so much energy. He really stretched to Alcarath, who wasn't at his absolute best. He dropped the first set, seven-five, hit back, taking the second by six games to two. But Tiafoe came back, he took the third, six-four, and the fourth went all the way to a tie break. So there was real concern as far as Alcarath was concerned. But he came through the breaker and then really up to gear in the final set to take that by six games to two. And as a result, takes his place in the last 16. But a real scare for Alcarath, no doubt about it. Kelly. 2013 Wimbledon champion, Marion Bartley is alongside Ian at Wimbledon. Marion, how would you sum up that encounter? We will get to hear what Marion Bartley made of that very shortly. Once we've got the more technical details sorted out, in the meantime, we can hear about Britain's Sonny Cartel, who's in action on court one against Coco Goff. Maz Veroucchi is watching this one. Maz. Hello Kelly, yes. Coco Goff serving for the first set, leading five-four. She has just broken Sonny Cartel in the previous game of this first set. But Sonny Cartel doing really well, I think, given the occasion, the fact she's playing in this arena at court one, and given the huge opponent she's facing over the net in the number two C, Coco Goff, she has rallied after conceding a break early on in the first set. And then she had two break-back points of her own in the eighth game of the first set, was able to take advantage of the second one of those with Goff serving a double fault, but then immediately was broken then in the next game by the US Open champion. So Coco Goff serving here at 30 Love in this first set, to take this first set six games to four. So a couple of points away, but Sonny Cartel with a wonderful four-hand winner there. So she's really rising to the occasion there. Obviously the challenge of facing Coco Goff is a huge one, but she's not letting the occasion overawar her at the moment. Maz, for now, thank you very much. Ian, back to you, because Emma Radhikhanu is in action against Maria Sakari. Yes, Emma Radhikhanu now has got the early break of serve here against Maria Sakari, but she is under a little bit of pressure here at 15-30 in her initial service game. Of course Radhikhanu is looking to build on what was a brilliant performance in the second round. She knows about Sakari in a grand slam environment, because she beat her in the semi-finals in the US Open when she won that a couple of years ago. So the Omens are good. It's a fairly sparsely populated centre court right now. People catching their breath after Al-Qurraf, but this will fill up, and I'm sure we'll turn into a real cauldron as this match continues. Ian, we are going to try and talk to Marian now. Hopefully, Marian, you can hear me, and I can hear you. It's all working perfectly now. Look, French Open finalist Jasmine Paulini is through to the fourth round for the first time at SW 19, but she's up against Madison Keyes next. Well, Jasmine Paulini has been really surprising since the beginning of the season. She never passed any more than the second round at any grand slam she played since the beginning of her career, until the Australian Open this year, when she started to reach the round of 16, and then she back it up with that beautiful and amazing run of wrong arrows when she conquered so many hearts with that beautiful smile on the court. Today she had a great victory over Bianca Andrescu, a former US Open champion as well herself, 7-6-6-1, very convincing, but she's up against Madison Keyes, Katie, and Madison Keyes is having a lot of firepower, and on the grush, she has proven over the years that that firepower can be extremely dangerous and hard to handle. So we will be in for a very tight contest between those two players. They're very close in terms of the ranking as well, so it's getting very interesting here at SW 19. Marian, lovely to talk to you eventually. Thank you very much to Marian Bartley, Hunter Ian Carter, and of course to Mars Ferooki. And remember that you can keep up to date with everything that's happening at Wimbledon as coverage continues on Sports Extra. We will have regular updates here on Five Lives Sport. We'll be back to Stuttgart very soon for second half commentary of that game between Spain and Germany, and then at eight o'clock this evening in Hamburg, it's Portugal against France, Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton will be your commentary team. Ali, it's a repeat of the 2016 Euros final, but much has changed since then. It's just a marker rather than a predictor. I mean, are we actually calling it Portugal, France, or are we just cutting to the chase and going straight to Ronaldo against Mbappe? Okay, let's start with the headline and then work our way into the details. I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek, actually, Kelly, because it is an obvious narrative. It is going to be a massive feature of tonight's game. And actually, I think both nations really need their star men to help them find a creative spark. I was saying to Chris yesterday, we're having a coffee in Berlin, I felt both teams have become a little constipated at this tournament. We have some great conversations, don't we? Genuinely, you two are spending far too much time together. Sometimes thoughts can stay inside your head, Ali, but there has been an issue with both these sides scoring. Yes, there has. And let's hope this is the evening when both teams really come to life in this competition. France, I mean, they always seem to go into tournament football and just do enough. So this is maybe when they can get going. And Portugal, everybody talks about Ronaldo. I wonder whether he is part of the problem, the fact that at the ripe old age of what is he, 39 now, that the team are always looking for him in an attacking sense. But they've got so many quality players through their side. Bruno Fernandez, Bernardo Silva, they are a talented lot. And it's an interesting game, difficult one to call. I just think that France eventually will click and Bapé hasn't really hit the heights. We know that he's capable of. So maybe this is the evening when it happens. Let's head back to Wimbledon and Masferuki. What rallies these two players are constructing here on court? One, exchanging ground strokes from the baseline, but the World Number Two, Coco Goff, has now just managed to wrap up the first set against the World Number 298, the Brit's Soné Cartel. Six-four, she's taken the first set of this third round match. Thank you very much for that, Mas. Remember, as always, Coverage continues on Sports Extra with updates here on Five Live Sport. Here in Hamburg, Chris Sutton and Alistair Bruce Ball, who you've just been hearing from, will bring us commentary of that big game between France and Portugal. In the meantime, we're going to head back to Stuttgart, where no goals is yet between Spain and Germany. Taking you through the second half, Cat Nevin and Ian Dennis. Thank you, Kelly. We have a change, though, for Spain. Leynall Mann, who was booked in the first half, and should Spain progress, he would be banned for the semi-final, has been replaced at halftime by Nacho. His only appearance was a start against Croatia in the first game. So, Spain line-up with Simon Engol, Carvajal Nacho, La Porta and Cucarrea, Fabian Rodri and Olmo in the midfield. Olmo, remember, came on in the first half for Petri, Williams, Yamal and Marathe. And in fact, Germany are going to be making a double change. Leroy Sarne has come off, and I think that is, indeed it is, Florian Wirtz is going to replace him, and Chan has also come off to be replaced by André. So, a double change being made by Germany. Well, it doesn't look really bad to me, but that's quite a lot of changes, isn't it? There are two changes at halftime there, but Chan wasn't... I thought he should have been booked anyway. They didn't look to me as if they had enough energy. I think they needed to add a little bit of energy, and if it's Sarne's come off for Wirtz, I think that might give a chance on Moussiali to go and switch wings, which is better over the other wing. So, she'll see if that makes a difference. Well, Wirtz straight away has introduced himself and has caught La Porta with a wrap around the heels. Wirtz just gets a talking to from Anthony Taylor. So, André replacing with his dyed pink hair. He's certainly standing out in the middle of that midfield. So, it means that Neuer is in goal, a back four of Kimmich, Rudiger, Tahr and Raum, Kroos, André and Gunduan, Wirtz, Habertz and Moussiali. For Germany, all in whites, against Spain in their red shirts and royal and their navy blue shorts, they're playing from left to right to Spain, where the majority of that red is behind that goal away towards our right. But early in the second half, and it started again in a stop-start fashion that was symptomatic, really, of much of the first half. Well, particularly the very beginning, 10, 15 minutes when you wanted the game to really explode, and it couldn't get going. Once again, everyone is up for this second half start. And right away, you've got an injury, and I don't think that was it. He wasn't pretending there, I think it was natural when down. Got his foot trodden on, but let's see if we've got a little bit better now. Carvajal comes forward and comes inside, and he finds Olmo. Olmo, there's no width. Williams has gone on ahead of him, but he does find Williams inside the penalty area. Williams with the cross. Yamal brings it under control, off his left foot, rolls it towards Marata. Marata with a turn, puts it over the top, seven yards out. Real chance. That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. By a wing, wing up, crosses off to the other one, and Yamal's clever enough not to just go and whip it, and it's tough to beat the two centre-backs. Obviously, Rudergan, the air, so he's put it into feet there, and he's got a very, very quick turn there on. Now, the referee seems to have pointed to some sort of a free kick, because it certainly didn't look offside to me when that ball was played in, but it couldn't quite keep it on target, but clever play there. We had a brief word with Antonio, a Spanish commentator at halftime, who was in full agreement with everything that you said in your summary with Kelly at the break. Yeah, particularly about the referee not moving the Spanish, but that's not a shock in Spanish radio, is it? Two and a half minutes into the second half, five live and BBC sounds. Virts touches the ball, Havertz man over, his kimmick right-hand side of the penalty area. Closed down by Cucaraya. Back towards... Andric hits it first time, it's curling, it's always going away from... from goal, from Robert Andric. And it will be a goal kick to Spain. I remember coming here in 2006, it was a UEFA Cup tie with Middlesbrough. They've since removed the running track, they've actually lowered the pitch, the stands have been moved closer to the action. It really is quite an expansive, but tidy stadium. It's a lovely stadium. Odd enough, I've seen a lot of stadiums here in Germany, which have held the atmosphere a lot better than it, but it's still a very impressive stadium, and let's be honest, they all have been in this tournament. Yes, they have. This is the Stuttgart, where Germany have a decent record. They're unbeaten in eight when they played here in Stuttgart, holds 54,000, and German voices trying to make themselves heard again, keep the host nation going. Spain, who have a wretched record, they have never, ever beaten the host nation at a major tournament in nine attempts. And indeed, in each of the last three, they've drawn and they've been eliminated on penalties. Certainly chances at a premium so far, early in the second half, on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, as Roger goes back to Simon. And talking of BBC Sounds, tomorrow is the sort of day that is made for it to take 5 Live with you wherever you go, and you think that New Zealand, England, the Rugby Union test gets underway at 5 past eight, the Rimbaldon coverage, England, Switzerland at five, to be followed by the Netherlands against Turkey at eight o'clock. So much live sport to look forward to. Throw in the British Grand Prix on Sunday as well, and hopefully 5 Live will get your vote. Five minutes into the second half, 0-0. Here is round. Back to Andric. Probs it, intercepted by Yamal, and he just lifts it out of play, catches it, and it will be a Germany throw. It's a shame it's such a beautiful little touch. We have a question to ask you about our Spanish journalist friend. Do you only bring him up because you think he looks like me? He's my brother. Didn't think you looked anything like Tommy. Famously. Talk to my people about that. Here is Kukareya, far side the left, chips it in field. Murata got a challenge from behind by Tahr, right in front of the referee, and again, Anthony Taylor tried to let the game flow. He did actually well to get something on it, Murata, but it was a clear foul. Free kick to Spain outside the centre-circle. Again, if we get something wrong, we have to see it. When he gets it right, the position, the ball is spot-on, seeing exactly what Tahr was doing there, and tried to let it play on. Did everything right there. Puyong is in the crowd. Piquet as well, I noticed, just sat in front of him down below. I have to see one of my favourite players, Heistro Rolf, football player, wonderful, wonderful player. That's fantastic. Here is Lameen Yamal running in from the right-hand side. And Dany Olmo coming onto that ball, hitting it first time right-footed, and Spain take the lead, right-footed, finds the bottom left-hand corner. Germany didn't react, and Dany Olmo gives Spain the breakthrough, 1-0. It's very noticeable that all the way through this game, Spain have been doing this. They do not lump the crosses in when they get away. They try to pass it in and find somebody running in from a deep area. A lot of the team has gone to Murata. This time almost coming from that deep area there. They didn't take a touch. He knew that he only had one possibility. First time, and he takes it, and he caresses it. Rather beautifully into the bottom corner there. But a lot of lovely pick-out there is, from Yamal on the right-hand side. Super wing play, and really intelligent pass there. But he came so late. Nobody picked up the run of Olmo, just inside the penalty area. Hit it first, time right-footed. And Neuer was given no chance, and Spain lead. It's something that the Spanish obviously work on. We see them do it time and time again. I mean, don't lump it in. If you have got centre-forward up there, and even though it's Murata, and he'll try and take on, he's got Taa, and he's got Routhiga. Don't lump it into the box. The chance is that you're not going to get anything. But if you pass it into the box and look for players running from deep, you can score, as they did there. Daniel Moe scored. The fourth goal against Georgia. That's his second goal of this tournament. And all of a sudden, now Germany have got a problem. Because if they were just trying to contain Spain in that first half, and the early stages of the second, they're going to have to come out. But by doing so, they're going to expose themselves to the pace that Spain have with Williams and Yamal. We could have done with that first goal right at the start of the first half. How about a goal early in the second, and that should definitely open up a bit of a gap between the two. And already has. Gündewan to Round. Left-hand side of the penalty area. Cross takes the deflection. Simon did ever so well there. Because the cross took a deflection, he got a fingertip save onto it, and it allowed Spain then to eventually clear the ball out of the penalty area. But Germany have won it back. Round passes the ball back towards Kroos. Kroos keeps it in play. This is Taa on the halfway line, left of the centre circle. Gündewan. He's got a good chance of getting the ball in the centre. The ball is out of the line. Left of the centre circle. Gündewan. Musiála to Round. Yamal picked up now by Musiála, driving the Spanish defence. Left-hand side of the box. Back towards Gündewan. Gündewan's cross. Kukerea tucked in. Heads it out. Andric passes the ball forward. Williams. All of a sudden, Spain can come forward now. Maratah away to the left. Olmo going on ahead of him. Williams looks for Olmo. Jonathan Taa will get there first with a back pass towards Neuer, and the game has certainly now stepped up. Yeah, this is a game we're respecting, it's finally happened. And you understand why it takes a lot of will, but just notice it now. Ram, he's almost playing like a right wing, a left winger. This game is so open immediately. This is Kymik. Kymik out towards that far side, Virts with a cross, forced towards Gundogam, taken away from his former Manchester City teammate, Rodri. He was pulling back the right boot, he was looking to hit that on the volley. But Rodri, right place, right time for Spang. Good reaction from the Germans, they're in the front foot here, creating chances all over the place. This is Andri, Mussiala, Mussiala again, Rodri, with a well-timed intervention with a challenge, because Mussiala was looking to try and get that shot away. It's amazing, isn't it, that straight away, the sides now up the ante. Yeah, I mean, people don't like to take chances because you're the one who can make a mistake, well, the game's now gone. It's open now, and the Spaniards are loving it because they've got spaces to break into as well. And Williams finds Yamal, and Yamal up against Round, helped out by Williams, backheels the ball towards Yamal. Yamal enters the penalty area, Williams has a little dig at goal, and it was a challenge coming in. Falkrog is going to be coming on, Germany are going to be making a change. Julian Nagelsmann not deliberating, not hesitating. He's going to make a positive change. Very brave, he's made two at halftime, gone one down there, straight into it, he's not waiting for the usual 60th minute before he makes the change, and interested to see who comes off. I mean, he usually takes Havertz off to bring Falkrog on, but Havertz has looked pretty good in this game so far. Here is Gundewan. Wirtz, far side the right, Germany trailed by a goal to nil. Here is Gundewan with his back to goal, right-hand side of the penalty area. Wirtz tries to pass the ball inside. Fabian, who hasn't really got forward as much, that was Andric catching Williams. He's gone down as the Spain player, and a yellow card, and Robert Andric will miss the semi-final, like Rudiger should Germany progress. Let's get an update from Wimbledonian Carter. Encouraging start for Emma Radikhanu, that early break of serve, which means that she leads by three games to two. She did have the chance of a double break. She had love 40 on the Maria Sakari serve, but she couldn't capitalise, so it's 3-2 with just the one break of serve first set. Now let's check in with the other Britain on court, with Masferuki on court one. Not the second set that Sonny Kartell have hoped for. She's lost both her service games in this set, and his love fell down to the world number two, Coco Gough here on court one in the second set, having lost the first, remember, 4-6. Commentary on Wimbledon continues on sports extra, so the double change is Maximilian Mittelstadt replacing Raam, light for light. He had the three starts at left back in the group stages, didn't play against Denmark, the Stuttgart defender, here on his home ground, and Nicholas Fulkru, getting a wonderful ovation, who has come on and he has replaced Ilkai Gundawan. So that is the double change that has been made by Nagelsmann as Germany look for an equaliser. That's a clever change. I mean, the left back for left back, actually, I don't think Raam was doing particularly badly at all, but the plate, obviously, he would argue was at fault at the goal because it came from that right-hand side, and Jamal. But to see Gundawan off, it gives you the chance to put Havers back in his best position, which is, you know, number 10, that Riven Deep with Fulkru up top, so I can see the thinking of Nagelsmann there. Andrake snapping at the heels of Fabian Ruiz, who tries to get away from him and succeeds. Fabian now to Carvajal, Spain lead by Goulton Hill. Fabian looks to play in Olmo, and here is Olmo right corner of the area, enters the box, head looking up, Ruedigo with a clearance, and eventually, Kimmich will run the ball away for Germany. But then Rodry with the interception, Fabian to Murata, forward ball, might fall towards... Williams off a sliding challenge that was made by the Germany defence. Here is Wirtz under pressure from Kukereya. This is where Spain try with their intensity to pin the opposition back, and at the minute, they're trying to beat that pressure. Neuer towards Tar, lifts it up towards Mussiala. Nacho tight behind him, Spain with a turnover. Olmo, the goal scorer to Rodry. They are a very, very impressive side. Yeah, they are lovely on the ball. Just a few minutes ago, we were down the right-hand side, and they tried exactly the same pass into the box. You described it perfectly in the commentary there. They just don't want to end there. They don't even dink it to the back post. Middelstadt... Ooh! It's got away with one there. I caught Middelstadt caught, but Anthony Taylor has told him to get up. Middelstadt was booked. Here'd be another Germany player who'd missed the semi-final. Over on that far side, Wirtz to the right, Germany trail, five live-in BBC sounds, Kimmich with a cross, repelled by the head of Le Porte, firm header two, back out towards that far side. As Williams goes to ground, no foul. Instead, it'll be a Germany throw, midway through the Spain half, as we approach the almark. I love the way this is set on there, because Phil Krug is... You know, he's just up there. He's a batter around the centre forward. He's got a knife and a goal as well. And he'll attack everything, which will leave space for Havertz to come in at that back post. Middelstadt with the cross. Havertz was up. Le Porte got the header away, collected by Germany and Kimmich right-hand side to Rudiger. Level with a penalty area. Rudiger's cross, brief header there by Le Porte, brushed the top of his head. Yermal is going to try and get it. Middelstadt, no, gets it away from him. His cross blocked by Carvajal. Olmo now lifts the ball up in the air, deep inside his own half, and plays it up towards Marathe. But Kroos gets there first. Andric passes the ball forward. This is Vertz looking to turn and shoot. Right-footed off target. Took a deflection on his way through. Yeah. It's a corner kick to Germany. Loving the pace of this game. And of course, it helps that the Germans... It can hear me over them. The Germans are shooting into their fans, just now, and they react really well. Because before, really hadn't been playing at 100%. This is everything they've got so far. They are throwing the catch and sink in the Spanish. They trail by a goal to Niel. An hour played on five live MVBC sounds. Corner kick to Germany, playing from right to left as we look. Kroos to take it. Far side the right. Rudiger up from the back as his tar. Havertz there. Fulcrum. A lot of targets in it comes. Le Porte, good header away under pressure. Collected by Vertz, chips the ball in, but chips it too long and out for a goal kick. It's a massive disappointment for the Germans here, because they're working now to get any positions just to put it in the mixer. And you can't blame them for doing it. If they're going to play football on the ground against the Spanish side, they're actually being second best. Not by a huge amount, but not second best. So they've just looked at it and thought, OK, can't do that. Let's see if we can do something else. It's kind of worked for them so far. They're getting into good areas, but that was a clear crossing. This is Germany's 19th quarterfinal at a major tournament. It's a record for any European nation. They have progressed from 15 of the previous 18, and indeed each of the last seven. But they are behind by a goal to Niel. As Spain are going to be making a change, and Ferran Torres is the player who's going to be coming on. He's appeared in three of the four matches so far. Cross from that far side, the right, from Kimmich, blocked by Cucarrea. They must be temptation off to bring their young Jamal off. He's making a few mistakes defensively. He has to follow his left fullback when he overlaps at this point in time. The moment he's finding it difficult. Cucarrea, ball over the top, who has looked towards Haberks and Cucarrea, couldn't take any chances, and headed it behind for a corner kick that Germany have looked about taking it quickly, and then have had second thoughts. And it isn't going to be LaMiglia Mal, who is the player coming off. So the youngest ever player at a European championship, still looking to be the youngest goal scorer, makes way for Ferran Torres. But he did get an assist. He got a give-up on that. The most important passer again so far was made by him. But he's beginning to get pushed a little bit further back, and he wasn't making the right decisions defensively. Totally and utterly understand why Dela Flanthard brought him off, even though it's always sad to see it, because he is a special, special talent that we're going to be seeing a lot of in the next 15 to 20 years. So Torres is on. Every red shirt is inside the penalty area. Corner kick to Germany, looking for an equaliser. With 27 minutes remaining. Cross, hands-on hips, waits to deliver. Referee Anthony Taylor is calling Rudiger towards him. Rudiger's already on a yellow card, and also Nico Williams. Now there is the referee's whistle. Play can resume. Corner kick, fast side the right. Full crook with the header, drops off target, and out for a goal kick. Spain still lead. This is going to be very, very difficult indeed for the Spanish. They're going to... This sort of... I mean, everywhere left, right, from deep, it's all going to put into that area. Full crook's going to attack everything. The centre-backs are going to be up. We know how the answer is a danger. It's going to be a long, oh, 27 minutes for the Spanish fans. Back to Wimbledon, Ian Carter. Two huge running forehands have helped Emma Radicalno dig herself out of trouble and hold serve after facing break points in the last service game. So Radicalno against Maria Sacuri, the Greek ninth seed, and Radicalno leads 4-2 first half. Whether it's Wimbledon or indeed the Euros, you can always listen to BBC Radio 5 Live through your smart speaker. All you've got to do is say, ask BBC Sounds to play Radio 5 Live. On this busy weekend that we're about to go into here, at SW19 and also across Germany. With 64 minutes play, the thunderclap echoes around Stuttgart as Simon comes to claim and collect that ball and now looks for the early release, right footed downfield. Almost goal is still the difference between the two. Middleshatt heads the ball forward towards Mussiala. There was no foul, says Carvajal. Anthony Taylor agrees, tells him to get up to his feet. As Havert comes in from the left touch line. Andric now onto the ball with that shock of pink hair. This is Wirtz looking to try and turn. He's side onto goal, coming on to it is Mussiala from deep. Fabian, oh, the decision has gone against Germany. Free kick to Spain, and wanted to take it quickly too. They couldn't get Ferran Torres on the ball. Yeah, I mean, Marathe, he's been clever trying to take it quickly there, but Marathe goes down and it's one of those things. It was the most tiniest touch in the back of his heel and he's completely and utterly collapsed on it there. And I think he's very unlucky. He's very lucky to get a free kick now. Marathe. Free kick to Spain. Fabian being pursued by Andric. Natural the substitute to Olmo, tried to roll away from Kroos. Kroos snapping away at his heels. Luis Delafuente apports the decision and apports Dani Olmo, whose goal is still the difference, that replacement early in the game for the injured Pedri. As Germany have about 25 minutes remaining to salvage their participation as the hosts in this Euro 2024 competition here in Germany. Fabian to Olmo, diagonal ball out then towards Ferran Torres, level with the penalty error on the right-hand side, back to Carvall. Little touch by Fabian, goes straight towards Tony Kroos, plays the ball in field, and it might just open up here for Germany. Full crook is ahead of him. Carvall does ever so well. Just gets a little touch with the right boot and Oonai Simon gathers it in safely. Spain still lead by a goal to Neal. Back to court one, Masferuki. The incredible run to the third round of Wimbledon for the world number 298. Sonny Cartel has come to an end here against the world number two, Coco Gough. It was a brilliantly evenly matched first set, but the US Open champion then raced away with the second. Gough coming through 6-4, 6-love. Olmo took back by Kroos. He was running away from goal. They were covering defenders, but it was a cynical bit of play by Tony Kroos, who has shown a yellow card and he's booked. Yeah, I mean, brilliant play by the goalkeeper. They've done it quite a few times, Simon. He played 20, 30, 40 yards, sometimes 50-yard ball, straight up the pitch. It's not a lump. It's a pass into that area. He's done it again there. It's flicked on. Kroos has got booked. He should have been booked earlier. Had he been booked to the start of the first half, as every chance he probably wouldn't have done that. Correct. Correct. And Olmo would have been maybe away. Although it wasn't a denying of a goal-scoring opportunity. But we're midway through the second half, and Spain lead by a goal to nil. Danny Olmo with a goal, 6 minutes into the second half. Fabian with a free kick. Left foot, it chips it. Into the penalty area. He heads it back. Can you hear this? Danny Olmo, break up there with Mussiola. Mussiola then tries to hit it early. Virts is saying that he was being impeded. He has a word with the referee, Anthony Taylor, who just glares at him, and the ball goes all the way through to Unazimo. Really difficult time, moments now for the Germans, because, you know, since the goal, they stepped it up, and it can work for a well, and then they made a change, and that worked for a well. But so far, the Spanish have survived it, and can the Germans keep at that level? Because they need to do that between now and the end of the match. There's a quarter of the match to go, and they need to keep it up at that level, or else they will not score a goal. That's the voice of Pat Nevin here in Stuttgart, where Spain have a slender lead. Just over 20 minutes remaining. Fabian back then with Unazimo, chips it forward, over the head of Kimmich, downward header by Williams to Marata, deep inside his own half, forward ball with Fabian, Marata, now up towards the halfway line, trying to turn with Rudiger, feeds it, and the gap has appeared for Williams, as Kimmich was downfield, Williams running now. Kimmich and Rudiger try and hold up Williams, he comes in between the two, the ball runs away from him, and there is Andric on the edge of the German penalty area, and Germany are back in possession, and Havertz, just outside the centre-circle, leaves it now for Wirtz, passes the ball to Middelstadt on this near side, the left, and then goes to the left corner of the left wingfield, to Mussiala, Wirtz has continued the run, left corner of the area, enters the box, but surrounded by the red shirt, that's what I was talking about, that work ethic, as the cross comes in, Havertz tries to get his head onto it, this is Falkrup, can't turn, Andric places it, great save by Simon, back out towards Havertz, they appeal for handball, Simon dives on the ball, and Spain still lead by Goulton Hill. Just behind that goal, every one of those German fans are screaming for the handball, something that the referee hasn't spotted, and we've just seen a little bit of a freeze frame, I can't see much in that so far, there may have actually been an argument for an offside, and a build up to that play, it did, definitely hit Cucarilla's hand, and his hand was out slightly, so we'll be having a look at that. At the minute there is no appearance on our little monitor that would suggest that VAR are doing so, of course Stuart Atwell is the VAR, well I say that they check everything, don't they? Yeah, but the hand wasn't high, it was lowered down by his knee, but it was out from his knee, and it's certainly, as far as I can see from the replay, caught Cucarilla's hand, and it was in the box. The point being is that they will have dismissed that check very, very quickly, as Fabian out towards that far side, 20 minutes remain, nevertheless, what a save by Simon. Yep, he's actually been fantastic, and this game not just with the saves, but also with his distribution, he's been really, really special. By the way, talking about hand balls from the balls crossed in, and the hand's just a little bit out the side, Denmark against Germany? Yes. Certainly the Germans have got lucky with that already in this tournament. Remember, no opposition player is yet to score against Spain, it was a Normand-owned goal against Georgia, but they've been impressed going forward, they've been equally impressive in defence as Andric forward. 19 minutes remain, five live and BBC sounds. Portugal, France, commentary to come from eight in Hamburg, with Alistair Bruce Ball and Chris Sutton. It'll flick down the line, right side of the penalty area, Wirtz back with Kimmich in field, Rudiger, first time cross, into the penalty area, Falkeruk sees it, Havertz, Havertz, great block by Carvajal, blocks the left-footed shot, knocking at the door, edge of the area, Middleshaw, waits. A wall of red though, Middleshaw has to pass the ball back inside, Tar floats it forward, Cucarrea tucked in, directs his header intelligently out towards Williams, who passes the ball towards Fabian, and Spain will do very, very well to bring this clear, as though Cucarrea has just shown too much towards Kimmich, and they've given the ball away as a result, with 18 minutes remaining. And in the city, which is known as the cradle of the automobile, Germany are looking to go through the gears in these closing stages, as the cross comes in, and Falkeruk's header back down, where it came from, is well off target, and out it goes for a goal kick, and Spain still lead 1-0. They still lead, but they're not getting out as much, are they? They're not being able to control the play, and in possession of the Germans have managed to get in this game so far, it's been pretty special, particularly in the second half, since they've lost the goal. Understandably, they've got everything to lose, so they need to go for it. What has impressed me is, they've actually changed the system two or three times. I've got Moussiala, who's... He's coming up, and he's trying to help me, and Berks is going a wee bit more central, but the play between the strikers has been very good. Falkeruk holds the ball up, lays it up towards Havards. Moussiala is to his left, he couldn't release the ball. Rodri has been superb. Rodri once again passes the ball now towards Ferran Torres. Ferran Torres will get there before Middleshaw, right-hand side. Middleshaw now dives in. Does he get the ball? No, says the referee, and Middleshaw is so annoyed with that decision from the English official. He might well have talked himself into the book, and Middleshaw is on a yellow card, and he too would miss a semi-final. It's a madness. I don't think he talked himself in there. I think he kicked the ball away. And that's a madness, to kick the ball away in Tokyo, you don't have to say anything for that one minute of stupidity. No, it's a harsh, it is a harsh free kick, but he didn't get the ball, and he touched the player, and he shoved him over. He can't do that. It's madness, absolute madness. By the way, is that where the free kick actually happened? It looks to me they've moved down a few yards. I've got to say, I thought it was a lot closer to the touch line. So did I. I agree with you, Pat. Ferran Torres to take it, but should Germany come from behind, they're currently trailing 1-0, and Rick, Middelstadt and Rudiger would all miss a semi-final. She was picking up a yellow card in this quarter-final, that they trailed by a goal to 0 with 16 minutes remaining. Ferran Torres then, just a few yards away from the right corner of the penalty area. Just wipes his chin with his left arm, swings it, towards the far post, kept him played by LePorte at that far post, and then maybe Germany can break. Mussiala held it all. That was a rugby tackle by Ferran Torres. He had no attempt to play the ball. He tried to bring him down by the shoulders. Something you'd see in the rugby union test tomorrow. That's one of the most ridiculous tackles I've seen in this tour. No, that is the most ridiculous tackle. It is a rugby tackle. It's one of those ones that's so cynical you just wonder, should it be worse than a yellow? Anyway, he's got away with the yellow. Rudiger goes with a searching diagonal ball. Just over a quarter of an hour remains here in Stuttgart, Spain leads Germany by a goal to nil. Fabian to Williams, running at pace, in from that left touch line, plays the ball behind to Marata. Marata goes square. Ferran Torres now, midway through the Germany half. Roderick just slows it down, calms everything down for Spain. Carvajal joins the attack. Ferran Torres, Spain keeping the ball. They're just shading it in terms of possession. 53% Moussiala and Carvajal. Last touch game of Carvajal. It'll be a Germany throw on the halfway line. Not Carvajal's best moment, is it? I mean, he's got the ball. He's got lots of options ahead of him. He tries a little dribble, completely enough to lose. It gives possession away. And considering it's so hard at the moment for the Spanish to get possession, I don't think his friends are going to thank him for that. Or should that be Amigos? It hasn't been the classic we were expecting, has it? No, but it's tense. I mean, as you're going to get that, sometimes it's like that. There's a lot of good players out in the show. There have been moments that have been very, very good. Technically, it's been an interesting game tactically as well. Millions and millions of chances? No, it has not been that. I'll grant you that. Here is Tar, left of the centre circle. Fulcruxis, a target along the ground, back towards Moussiala, stooping head of by Carvajal and gathered in by Seymour. Ian Carter at Wimbledon. First set, Emma Radikano against Maria Sacri of Greece. A double break came in the seventh game, courtesy of a stunning lob right onto the baseline. A tortuous game to serve it out, two break points saved, and Radikano gets the first set by six games to two. Commentary continues on Sports Extra. Middleshap with the back pass to Neuer. Neuer passes it right-footed to Rudiger. Kimmick has stayed quite high on that far side, and here he is, over the halfway line. He looks for the run a verge round the back of Kukerea. Fulcrux is the post! Fulcrux, who was falling down to the ground right-footed, hits the base of the right-hand post, and Germany comes so close to an equaliser. Fabulous, fabulous break there. The pace of that was incredible there, but that's so full, Krux, isn't it? It looks like there's nothing on, no chance at all. You're right, he's falling, the ball zipped across him, but he somehow manages to get enough power on it, and Simon Krux would have done nothing about it, saved by the post. First time that they've got round the back of Kukerea. Yep, and he's done really well so far, but he can put under pressure by a whole bunch of them, and they're looking at the German bench now, and they're all up, trying to get the fans to lift the team. They're whipping up the crowd, and the crowd responds inside this arena that holds 54,000 here in Stuttgart. 13 minutes remaining. Otherwise, Germany, the host nation, are going out in the last eights. Here is Rudiger, forward ball to Vox. Spain are going to make a double change. Moreno is going to be coming on, and I think Oya Sabel is the other player who's going to be coming on as well. Two players who have been loyal servants to Luis de la Fuente for the success that he's had with the Spanish youth sides in his career. It's been tough for them hasn't it? They're not used to chasing the Spanish. They're used to holding the ball, controlling the pace against, having lots of possession. They've not had much, they scored that goal. Kimmich with a cut back right-hand side, falls to Virts. Virts can't get the shot away, and in the end it's just cleared long. By Fabian, Neuer is the one, the sweeper-keeper comes almost to the halfway line, but he puts it out of play for a throw. Didn't he once do that before and make a big mistake? I think some time ago. But he'll make those changes now, and you understand why, very, very tiring for a number of those players, particularly in the midfield, for the Spanish at the moment, so he's going to try and make changes. He'll give a little bit more energy than they have. For most of the game, the Spanish with a more energetic side, but it hasn't been that for about 15 minutes. 11 minutes remaining, a lot of liquid refreshment is being taken on board, on this. Sultry Nights in Stuttgart. Williams is the player who's going to be coming off. And we're also going to see Maratta coming off, so... Oya Saval will replace Alvaro Maratta, the Real Sociedad striker, has appeared now in every game. This is his fourth appearance off the bench. He did start against Albania, and Nico Williams for Mika Moreno, the former Newcastle United player, also coming on. And taking their time as well, much to the annoyance of the German supporters, less so the German players, who are getting instructions from Nagelsmann and a lot of liquid refreshment. Yeah, they've got real belief in themselves. You're looking at the German team down there, on the bench down there, they still don't look panic to me. They're a team that seems to believe, no, we're going to make chances. We'll get a few more. Before the end of the game, there will be a little chance, now and again, and all the Germans again, another substitution, to be a really going for it just now. Would there be a more popular goal scorer to get an equaliser than Thomas Muller? He's never scored at the Euros. He only has made one appearance in this European Championship, and that was against Scotland for the final 16 minutes. Let's try to see if there's a tie that came off from there. Wow, you're going seriously positive. Here is Fabian. Fabian to Oya Sabal, couldn't get there. It might come out to Ferran Torres, attempted clearance blocked, comes towards Moreno, Moreno, plays it out, and over the head of Olmo, and out it goes for a throw. I'll be intrigued to see what the Germans are doing now. It looks to me that they're putting Andric back there, along centre-back, alongside Tony Rudiger, that's given Muller a chance to go in, and what an attacking look inside the Germans on now. And Havards picks it up, and he drives forward over on that right-hand side, passes the ball up towards Muller, but just coming across his nacho, all with his experience, the Real Madrid defender. Cucarero gives the ball away, straight towards Andric, nine minutes remaining, Kroos to full group, backs a goal, turns, plays Mussi-Alarin, inside the penalty area, inside left channel, shoots left footed, off target, goal kick, Spain still lead 1-0. Yeah, it's good tactic with Aubain, I go to Sven, he's asked a lot of different questions, and the team that he's playing just now, the way they're playing, they're trying to push you up almost like a 2-3-5. Now, if anybody who's a certain age will remember, that's decades and decades and decades of goals, and that's played there. Rudiger's having to go out to the right-hand side there. In Spanish team, they're trying to do, and what they're doing is they're putting their wingers to go, it's way responsible. Two good coaches, they're asking lots of different questions, and they shall... That's the voice of Pat Nevin on five live, as Ulai Semon has been shown a yellow card for time-wasting by referee Anthony Taylor. Don't think he can get out good, but not too much there. And right behind them, everyone of those Germans, finds well-lit an Antinitello Norbeau. By the way, Antinitello's had a much better second half. Think he's ready for... Not been in the mistakes in his second half, so he's done well. It's the eighth yellow card that has been shown by Anthony Taylor. Semon with a clearance, wasn't the best. Strikes the legs of the court, falls towards Havertz. Havertz with a chip! Just over the top! Semon was off his goal line, and Havertz went mightily close for a German equaliser. He should get it on target. He really should. Semon, terrible goal kick, and then comes out when he shouldn't. And he leaves himself completely in no-man's land there, balls dinked over the top, Havertz knows. He's tried to give it a little bit more, because he knows Semon's a big tall goalkeeper. He should get that on target. Ulai Semon testing the patience of the German crowd. He's just been booked. He has to be careful. Clearance downfield, headed on by Moreno, headed back by Middelstadt to Manuel Neuer. By my watch, we have seven minutes remaining of normal time. Germany looking for a late equaliser, just as they did when they met back last time at the World Cup. It was around now that that man Falkirk scored, but this occasion, he gives it away. And the ball is played forward by Le Port. And now brought down by Torres to Rodgerie. Foul from Moula on the back of Rodgerie. Free kick to Spain inside the centre-circle. It's a fury, and for Moula, for all his talents, he's not the pace he's playing the world anymore. And the one chance he's had since he came on, the ball was played far too far in front of him. But you know, it could be the romantic story, couldn't it? That he gets the goal that changes everything for the country. The winners of this will meet the winners of Portugal, France, in the semi-final in Munich on Tuesday. You'll hear that quarter-final tie in Hamburg at 8 o'clock tonight on Five Live. This is Fabian, who shoots edge of the area. It was a wild effort, left footed. He actually had Oya Sabel to his left, who was free. That's the second time he's done it. He's done it in the first half as well. There was an overlap on the left-hand side, and two players, Niko Wilkes, was waiting for it. And it was Monata as well on that occasion. This time, I mean, it's unthinkable we do that, because he's got the vision to see that, so that's a mistake. Spain looking to maintain this winning run. It would be 11 consecutive games in competitive football. It would be their best run actually, since they achieved 14 13 years ago. Rudiger. German crowd though still haven't lost faith. Full group, falling theatrically to the floor, but getting a free kick, some 26 yards out from goal. First of all, it looks a little bit lucky, but Carvajals come in. You would call that a clever little nudge, but it ain't clever if it gives them a free kick. It's about 30 yards out. It looks a little bit too far. It's shoot from there. Gross may think about it, but with a pair that he's got at that back post, you think he's going to get zipped in a lane with the back post, cuddling in towards it for his strikers, and he's sent back to go and attack it. So you're suggesting he's not going to do a Ronaldo? I don't think he's that carried away at the moment. Not quite yet. One big deep breath from Tony Kroos. But you never know, by the way. Well, Mullahs just had a word with him as well. Rudiger is hobbling. He used all of their five substitutes of Germany. It's just under 30 yards out from goal. Five minutes remain. Kroos waits to take it. Kimmich has made the darting run up from the back. Referee, he went to find him too and succeeded, but the referee has called it back much to Kroos' frustration. He did exactly the same for a free kick in the first half when it was Rudiger who went wide. So you can see what we're trying to do there, that the referee's not spotted it and held up the play. Kroos waits, chips it into the penalty area. Havers down with header, turned behind by Seymour. Referee has spotted a bit of pushing. It wouldn't have counted anyway. It'll be a free kick to Spain. Yeah, Havers getting on the end of it. I mean, he's getting himself sent in brilliant positions, but he just cannot do the final thing though. There's a little nudge there. Not a huge amount, but it's enough to put the defender off. The defender in that case was natural. He feels, hands in his back, he's going down. Time is in short supply for Germany here in Stuttgart. Four minutes remain. Unai Seymour. Gain didn't really get much elevation off that clearance, but Olmo touches the ball out to that far side of the left for Kukere, and it'll flick by Olmo. That was Andric who won it forcefully. Havers is released on the left-hand side. Havers looks up, level with the penalty area, sends over the cross, and Carvajal arriving at the far post. Heads it, flying header behind for a corner kick. Germany are putting Spain under pressure. Where have they got the energy from? They didn't look like they had that sort of energy in the first half, but they know they're going to enter this tournament, and they have played really well in the second half since they lost the goal of the Germans. On this muggy evening in Stuttgart, three minutes of normal time remain on five live and BBC sounds. Spain still lead 1-0. You wouldn't put it past them, would you? No, you wouldn't. Kroos rolls it from this near side of the left to Kimmich. Backheels the ball to Kroos. Kroos cuts it back, Mussiala just inside the penalty area. He tees up, middle stat, shot blocked, cleared away, but Olmo anywhere will do for Spain. Out it goes for a throw. They're firmly on the back foot now of Spain. The Lafianse is telling his players to calm down. Yeah, right. Look, chance they're going to get any opportunity to calm down, because they're getting closed down. They're putting under pressure just now, but they're tired. Here is Andriy. Passes the ball out wide. Moula, his diagonal cross from that right-hand side. Full crook touches it on with his head. Mussiala left-hand side of the penalty area. Mussiala can't get a shot of goal. He tries to pull it back to the edge of the area. There's a potential break-on. Oya Sabal is going to give chase. Noya, though, is out of his penalty area, and he'll leave it. And Noya will take the throw, and he takes it quickly and plays it down this near side to Middleship and then the halfway line. The left back finds Kroos. Spain are desperate to get every red shirt back behind the ball. Kroos floats it out towards the right. Moula controls it, waits. Still, they're not panicking, but there is that... a degree of urgency. Of course there is. It's Rudiger. But there's a structure about their play. In comes the cross, bounces off the chest of Havertz. Vertz touches it. Kroos works it out towards the left. Middleship out with a cross, queuing over the far post. Kimmick is there, down into the ground. And then, the goal is to convert the goal. And it's coming. Junior arrives, and Germany are back level. With about 90 seconds of novel time remaining. One-one. Oh, I said to him, he could have passed them. Of course, he could have finished it. He had so much pressure. There have been so many goals in the post. He had so many strikers and so many quality players there. It is absolutely no surprise whatsoever that they've got this all back. And then, no matter how much pressure they've got this all back. And they now have everything in their favour. Because the Spanish look tired, they've made a lot of changes. Well, it looks like we're going to have 30 more minutes of pure drama here. Thank goodness you're not going to train to catch. The bench absolutely exploded down below. They were running on the pitch, they're whipping up the crowd. I can see a beer being tossed by the German supporters. By the way, there should be a number of players booked here. A good number booked here. He's actually booked one, right? I would say there were seven German players that are not on the pitch just now. He shouldn't have been on the pitch. They ran onto the pitch. The whole bunch of them booked. He's matched about one. I don't know which one it was. He looks quite disappointed. We'll try and bring you confirmation of that. But they always seem to find a way. They're going to have a one-one verts with a goal in the 89th minute and there will be four minutes of added on time which we're now going into on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. But Germany have got designs on winning it here in stoppage time. Fabian gets the ball away up towards Rodgery. Rodgery turns and the pressure has to pass it back to Oono Cimod. And then it's a hard one to call. It's one-one. It's been a time of my experience with a better save until they scored the goal. And so Germany by some distance have been a better save. But they're not going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. They're going to have it. They're going to have it. They're going to get it. They've no time to get it. And it's a hard one to call. But you've got to see Germany are there in ascendance. Just know by a long way. And if you're the Spanish, you've got to try and make some changes now. They've made one or two already. The fact that they've made 1, 2, the sixth German yellow card in this quarterfinal here in Stuttgart. Still to come. We've got that game between Portugal and France. A spader on the attack, cross from the left-hand side, cleared away by Andric. There's a German player down at the moment. A Spain win the ball through Rodgery. It's got a head injury. They're entitled to play on. Oya Savl tries to wriggle away from a challenge, gets a push, goes down just outside the area. Referee Anthony Taylor says no foul. And now Germany try and break. They're quite happy to break now that the player, Fulcrum, is back on his feet. As Kroos took a tumble as well, it's all happening. I saw that classic win with footballers getting all the calls, they won't kick the ball out. They don't need to. It's not in the rules to kick the ball out. It's a referee's decision. Fulcrum will play absolutely fine. The Spanish were right to play on. But I think the Spanish should have got a free kick now. Just about 20 yards out. They were very, very lucky the Germans had. They were furious. They've got a little bit kind of a way they could have given a free kick away 20 yards out. Central, right in front of their own goal. They had the pyrotechnics at the start. The game itself was certainly a slow burner in the first half. But now it should boil up rather nicely for this extra time period that is looming. As Wirtz, they've got the equaliser for Germany, goes in pursuit of the ball. Uniseem on there will get there first. By my watch, we've just got about 70 seconds remaining of this minimum of four to be added on. And it's 1-1 between Spain and Germany. The two best sides so far in this tournament. Going at it. Head-to-head here in Stuttgart on five-lie. Don't forget tomorrow, England, Switzerland. Five o'clock commentary from Düsseldorf. As Ferran Torres bursts into the penalty area, Andric falls free kick to Germany. And Netherlands, Turkey will round off the last day's action tomorrow night in Berlin. You know what's really clever though, watching Wirtz and Eglensman is done. You know, as soon as they scored the goal, they had the wildest, you know, almost 2-3-5. They switched wild, but they were going for it. Soon as they scored the goal, they've managed to get back into a 4-2-3-1. And the two players, Moussiala, who doesn't play there in the centre midfield, he's gone back there because they have to get another player back into Andric's, who's had to go centre half alongside Rudiger. So the speed in which they're making these tactical changes and the cleverness of them, very impressive. 30 seconds remain. Muller, left-hand side. Muller with the cross. And the header from Nato almost presented it towards Falkruck. He's going to keep the ball in play on that far side, the right. He tried to bring it down and around waist-height with his right boot, Kimmich with the cross. Muller is there and Muller just steers it wide of an air post. Never scored in his entire career in the Euros. He went close there. Honestly, the way it's going just now, it's been just half to get to extra time. They're hardly ever getting off the back at all, just know they've managed to get there, but by the skin of their teeth. There is the end of the 90 minutes. Spain won, Germany won, almost giving Spain the lead after 51 minutes. But then Florian Vert with an equaliser in the 89th minute. We're going into extra time. For the time being, we'll hand you to Hamburg and Kelly Gates. Thank you very much for that, Ian Dennis and Pat Levin, watching that game and Stuttgart for us. We are in Hamburg, we've got a big kick-off later on between Portugal and France, that one coming up at eight o'clock. But Pat, this game, it felt like Spain were in control, they got the goal, then there was a point where it felt like they were just trying to protect their lead. Was that the point that it started to slip away for them? Maybe so, but here it looks like the win and the goal, they are the best team, they are controlling last pass, but not the entire table game, but last pass of the game. They score the goal and it's just nice. We've seen a million times, you fall back a little bit, but I have to say the Germans changed everything. They started making tactical changes, substitutions, taking more chances, more risk, made more positive, more direct, getting balls into the box. Suddenly you've got Havertz is up there, Foucault is up there, Mussial is still on, Vertz comes on. They're attacking from absolutely everywhere. Eventually, just go to this 2-3 at the back, and you think you will throw the catch and sink into it, which they indeed did, but there's something else on top of it, Kelly. They just believe, they really just believe, they never feel as if they're out of it, and you can see that the Spanish team, they believe staff is sapping away as soon as they start to get overpowered. Now, it's very, very soon after they score the goal, and I've got to say it's partly down to Neglesman, who's made such very, very good and very, very brave changes. Yeah, Germany have been brave, and it has paid off for them. They are level with Spain. They're heading into extra time. Pat Neven talked about the noise inside the stadium and Stuttgart there. Actually, here in Hamburg, where it looks as though it's mostly France and Portugal supporters, there was huge noises as Germany equalised. Alistair Bruce Ball's going to be commentating on Portugal France later, but Ali, just a word on the reaction to that Germany equaliser. Clearly, there are German fans inside this stadium as well, and I was trying to think, as to the Portugal and France fans, maybe they've got a leaning towards who they might... you know, fancy-facing in the semi-finals. I think, plus just the drama of a late goal, game has been shown entirely on the big screens at either end of this stadium, and the fans have been in here for ages, haven't they? They've been here to watch that entire game. So, yeah, atmosphere is good. Team News ahead of the eight o'clock kick-off. It is really nice and simple, actually. Roberto Martinez has gone with exactly the same Portugal starting 11 that Squeak threw in the penalty shootout against Slovenia in the last 16. So, Cristiano Ronaldo goes looking for that first goal at this tournament, captains the side and leads the line. Two changes for France, two players getting their first starts at this tournament. 21-year-old Eduardo Camarvinga of Real Madrid comes into the midfield. That's because Adrián Rabio is suspended, and Randall Colomuane, who's made a few substitute appearances at this tournament, took great effect in the last game against Belgium. And the first shot that was deflected in for the winner, he comes in for Marcus Turan. Let's check in at Wimbledon with Ian Carter. Well, the first set went the way of Emma Radacanu against Maria Sacari, the ninth seed from Greece. And it's Radacanu of Great Britain, who's got the early break of serve in the second to open a 2-1 lead. She's having to work really hard to consolidate that break of serve, but she does have game point right now, Kelly. This is the best tennis this week that we've seen from Emma Radacanu since she won the US Open in 2021. And it's worth remembering that she beat Sacari in the semifinals at Flushing Meadows, en route to that maiden Grand Slam title. Radacanu serves it out there. She does consolidate the break of serve. She now leads by three games to one in the second set, and by one set to luck. Thank you very much for that, Ian. Remember, we will have regular updates here on the next five live sports, but you can listen to full coverage of Wimbledon on five sports extra. Extra time about to get underway in Stuttgart. It finished Spain one, Germany one, after 90 minutes taking you through the period of extra time. It's Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis. Thank you, Kelly. Germany have made their sixth and final change, and it's the Stuttgart captain here in his home ground, Valdemir Anton, who's going to be coming on for just his second appearance of these Euros. He's going to be playing against Denmark, so he will slot in alongside Rudiger, and the player who's gone off is Kei Haber. Yeah, and they've just gone safe again, haven't they? Knowing that they can adapt any time. They've actually looked to me like they've gone off almost a 3-4-3. Rudiger's going to be a right centre back at this point in time. And that's what you get at the very top level. Adaptability, ask different questions, change the shape, and believing that players can do different things. When you ask them, we do different things, and confuse your position. I have to say, Niggles, he's done it more. Well, it's the first period of extra time. He's under way. Germany in all whites playing from left to right here. Hab Kimmich is a right back. Rudiger now has Anton alongside him. Middelstadt, another substitute, there's a left back. You've got Wirtz, Andric, Kroos, Mussiala, Mulla and Fulkrich. Spain are attacking. Ferrantoro is trying to get his head onto that. And it's a goalie, and he's targeting out for a goal kick. Spain have Simon in goal, Carvajal, Nacho, Laforte and Guacare, Fabian Rodri, Olmo Moreno, Torres and Oya Sabel. So they, by my calculation, still have two substitutes who they can bring on if they so wish for Luis de La Fuente. They're a 63-year-old coach. But we're in extra time. Five live and BBC sounds on a busy weekend that we're about to go into here. A sporting action. Not just the Euros, Wimbledon, British Grand Prix and that Rugby Union test tomorrow morning. But here is Fulkrich turning and running. Pass the centre-circle in the Spain heart. Kroos comes in from Wirtz and Nacho is the one who has to turn it behind for a corner kick. Look at that, there was a little bit of hesitation between him and Simon. There's no chances. Horrible possession at Wirtz, but that ball into Wirtz. He's gone to Wirtz and to Defenders. Doesn't want to take any chances. Goldkeeper just can't quite come to it. He's actually, well, obviously he's done well. He scores since he came on, but Wirtz is special player. He's had a really, really good season. He's been a lot of well-to-get involved in this game, but now he looks to be one of the most important players. That's not the most important. Joining the break for extra time, the third-choice goldkeeper, Alibaba Balmón was trying to stir up the Stuttgart crowd. Carvajal has gone to the floor in an off-the-ball incident and he's being helped back up by Mullah. Germany have a corner kick. 1-1 early in the first period of extra time here in Stuttgart. Corner kick then far side the left. In it comes now. There is another coming together between Mullah. On this occasion it was Nacho. There's a little slip. This is Kroos. Mussiala. Mussiala passes the ball out towards the left-hand side. And then Wirtz able to turn. Left corner of the area. Helped out by Mussiala. Middleschtatt delivers the cross. Hasn't been dealt with. It went through two Spanish defenders. Flags up on this near side. It'll be a Spain free kick. Yeah, but the Germans are actually smothering him. It just cannot go out. The Spanish, now when they had Marat up to open the ball was coming up to him. He was holding it well. Nice little neat 1-2 passes. Alone he's way plus. Come on. But if you look at that forward lane now, it's completely changed for the Spanishers. Yassabao, Moreno and Torres are up front now. And that hasn't looked as dangerous as the previous three. That says that Germany is smothering Spain. Certainly suffocating conditions here on a very humid evening. Kukarera has gone down off the ball with Wirtz. He's gone down with Wirtz. He's headed into the floor. Anthony Taylor has spotted it. The Spanish bench are all up in arms. And Wirtz is shown a yellow card. Yes, another yellow card shown to a German player. You wouldn't believe how many times Kukarera and this German has gone down holding his face. It's extraordinary the amount of times he's done it. And he's kind of run towards a player. He's kind of blocked him a lot of it, but it's the way he throws himself down. It's incredible. That's the tenth yellow card in the game. Seven to the host nation on five live here in extra time. The ball back by La Porte to Unozimot who's well out of his penalty area almost to the edge of the centre circle chips it forward headed on by Fabian Moreno out towards Olmo. Kukarera ahead of him. Olmo tries to pass the ball forward to Oya Savo. And it runs in a diagonal path out for a goal kick. One one. This has got the look of penalties. No, I'm not diving in there yet. I'm definitely not diving in there yet. That was really neat, you know from the Spanish club. Not being up the park that much in the last quarter of the game in normal time. But that was clever. I mean, he passed it well and they're there again. Oya Savo gets the shot away blocks. Anton digs it out with his shaven head. Here is Rodgery just touches the ball back the port forward ball early to Kukarera. Kukarera to Olmo on this near side the left Redshirts, Navy Shorts playing from right to left as we look. Strokes it back to Kukarera. Dele Fuente only lost one of 14 competitive games. Narglesman who's yet to lose a competitive fixture since he took charge last September. Scenic side come from behind and score eight and that's the reason we're in this additional 30. As the ball is passed out by Fabian and then Nacho. Ferrant Torres on that right-hand side has to go all the way back. They've lost that little sprinkling of stardust with Williams off the field and LaMine Amal as well have Spain. All of a sudden it could be a case of Groundhog Day if you're a supporter of Spain their record against the Hodes Nations as Fabian curls the ball out to Ferrant Torres level with the penalty area right-hand side back with Carvajal. Left footed ball back towards Torres. Carvajal bombs on ahead of him and he finds him. He's got round the back here but he couldn't deliver the cross. Now he has. Chips it in. Rudiger heads it away Fabian. Nice little touch off the top of his left foot. Just drifts out towards that far side. Germany try and wrestle the ball off him. Plays a cute ball inside towards rotary. Spain keep the ball well under pressure. Nacho finds Moreno. Moreno along the ground. Olmo now left corner of the area. Carvajal on the open up. Olmo goes for goal. Blocks comes out towards rotary. Spain keep the ball well Pat Nevin. Yeah best period in the past since they actually scored their own goal. A lot of bad belief coming back. Just that rest after the 90 minutes giving them a bit of left and certainly the manager said look you've got to hold the ball. You've got to have foot hold in this game. They have manis to do that at the start of this extra time. They're slugging out here in the middle. Here is Olmo. Couldn't thread the ball through. Blocked by Rudiger. Olmo reacts to get that loose ball back. Here is Olmo once again. Back with Kukereya. Midway through the Germany half. Germany got every white shirt back behind the ball. Le Porte to Nacho inside the center circle. Rodry gives it to Nacho. And now with Le Porte to come forward. He'll carry the ball as far as he can. They'll burst there from Le Porte. Then they lose the ball. Muller didn't really have anybody going too far ahead. There was only Fulcruc. They decide to keep the ball and it's with Wirtz on the halfway line and he finds Muller now. Muller challenged by Kukereya. It goes out of play for a Germany throw. They take it quickly. Muller with a throw. Finds Wirtz. Wirtz with a cross from the right-hand side. Clear away by Nacho. Downward header back by Le Porte and then Oyasavl to Fabian. More players have gone down. That was Kroos. You're in a Kroos right at the start of the game. He leaves his body in to take a play-out and we thought he should have been booked. I wonder if that was not dissimilar if it was a foot stamp. No, not dissimilar, but not as vicious as the one he did. Very early on in the game against Pedry. I think Kroos looks a wee bit tired out there, don't you? Well, he's wiped. He's been lured out of international retirement in March after retiring when they lost to England in the last Euros three years ago. He will be bringing to an end. The glittering career is there to be one final dance. He's back on his feet now as the 34-year-old. They've used all their substitutes, so he's got to see it through to the bitter end. Or will it be a joyful conclusion here as we're still at the end of the year? We're going to have a very serious period of extra time. We have about six minutes to go in the break. I think the changes that Farnham Nagersman has made for this part of the game haven't worked as well. The negative ones have had a negative effect on his team so far. They finally get out of their own half. In Spanish, they've lifted a little bit. They believe in themselves a wee bit. They're going to have a very serious period of extra time. They've got to be very serious about the game. I think the Germans are very good. The ball, Mulla gives chase, Kukaraya alert, covers. It goes to Oona Sima. Clears it long. Headed forward by Anton. There's hardly any prep inside this stadium. They're four around there. For a certain age, it has to be said as well. They're feeling it. You can see Crosses is feeling it to some degree as well. But it doesn't matter. You have to keep on going. There are very few options left. Attention being cranked up as well. Carvajal could be showing a yellow card for handball here. Denny Carvajal will miss the semi-final. So all of a sudden, if Spain do go through, they've lost half of that back four that has really been quite a battle defence, with the exception of when they made the 10 changes against Albania because Le Normand and Carvajal will both miss the semi-final in Munich. I was going to suggest he can't have a complaint. But he absolutely deserved that. He knew exactly what he was doing. He got his hand up, stopped the ball going through. He didn't want to chase back there. He's going to miss the next one if they get through. Germany are attacking. Middlesfield far side. Moussiala in field to Wirtz. Moussiala wants the return ball. He finds it. He darts towards the byline, pulls it back, beaten out of the near post by Simon. And then there's little shrug. Header away by Kukareya. Andric has a swing at that with a right footed volley on the edge of the area. Absolutely skyd it. Gold kick, 1-1. Simon has to be very, very careful there. He's going to try and collect a ball that was coming from a real distance, from a real height. You know, look to me as if he's certainly pushed somebody there. But was it a red or a white shot that he's pushed? Actually, I'll give him a cheer. And I think was it full crew? Tried to get in front of him to make sure he couldn't get the ball. Talking about tired players. Fabian is down at the moment. Is that a touch of cramp? Spain have still got two opportunities to... Well, they've got two more players to potentially bring on. I thought they only had one. Must have got that wrong. They've brought on Nacho Moreno, Olmo, Ayers Sabel, they'll get the extra one in. In extra time. Yes, there's the one they're going to go for, I think. May have to get half a chance, we shall see. Talking about a story. Born in Stuttgart, Hossaloo. Could it be a fairy tale for Hossaloo and his hometown? We've just seen Mussiala. Likewise, born in Stuttgart, trying to create some magic. But Fabian, who for me has been one of the standout players for Spain in this tournament, is going to be coming off. He turns to Alonso Mourinho, who is going to be coming off. He turns to acknowledge the Spanish crowd away towards our right-hand side. Olias Sabel, I would imagine, will just drop a little bit deeper. But Hossaloo, five goals in his 12 appearances. Second appearance of this tournament. He did start against Albania. Hossaloo comes on. Made his international debut at the age of 32. Just a couple of years ago, he scored within two minutes. He comes on for Spain. One-one in extra time. Five live and BBC sounds. The first of the quarterfinals that you'll hear all on five live and BBC sounds over the weekend. In and around Wimbledon, Coverage, the rugby union test. First thing in the morning, England, Switzerland, at Düsseldorf, five o'clock tomorrow. And the British Grand Prix on Sunday as well. Is Andriak out of play? No fouls, says Anthony Taylor. It'll be a great game. And the first half of the season, is Anthony Taylor. It'll be a Spain throw-in down below. We have about two minutes remaining of this first period of extra time. Yeah, but I'm not sure that he would have chosen Hossaloo to come on just now. He has chosen, and I think he makes him look a lot better. A bit stronger. They've got a focal point now up top there for them to have to play a long ball. They can play to him, so that's actually the main work for the Spanish. He's up there, and of course, being marked by Rudiger as the shot comes in from distance. It was from Oya Sabel, who hit it outside the penalty area, left footed, and it whistled wide for a goal kick. I'll tell you what, Noyar wasn't comfortable there, was he? He's scampering across his goal there. He must have seen it quite late as well. And it's just bounced before his hand. He wasn't getting to him because it bounced under him. And I think we're very relieved, man, it went past that back post. But as Georgia, this first period of extra time, totally unlike the 25 minutes before that, Spain would be the better side. 1-1, Noyar goes long. Rodgerie tries to throw Muller out of the way, as the ball is tidied up by La Porte back to Ounai Simon, who has a very good record when it comes to saving penalties in shootouts. Will it go that far? Pat thinks not. For the time being, at least, Mussiola over the halfway line. Andric coming forward for Germany. By my watch, we're inside the last 60 seconds of the first period of extra time. Taser slowed down, Croce passes the ball out towards Middleshaw. The left back gets it back for Germany, back in field to Croce once again. Every outfield player in the half away towards our right-hand side. He tries to get away from Hosselut. The two Real Madrid players, shoulder to shoulder. Rudiger back with Anton. Germany's turn now to see a lot of the ball. Rudiger passes the ball all the way back to Noyar. Just looking at Rudiger there. He looked to me injured, but 10 minutes to go in normal time, but he's kept on going. He was the player, if you remember, who was the first to go into the right-hand side and got the first ball in. So he'll be happy. Opportunity here, Nuller. Verzolli was close. Hitted first time left-footed, but it was always going away from goal of that right-hand post, but that was almost an opportunity for Germany to take the lead. Carbon copy of the Spanish goal. Almost exactly the same move. Coming from the other side, though, passed towards the back post, but he was almost able to go there. And this time he wasn't able to do that. And a good move there for the Germans. Their best moment of these 15 minutes, and they've got one minute extra. It's tense here in Stuttgart. Una Simon, who's already been shown a yellow card for time-wasting in no real hurry, were inside the 60 seconds of added-on time. Andric heads it away, repelled by the head of Le Port. Andric then again climbs to head it further away, comes back, like head tennis at the moment, it won't come down, and then eventually it does, and there's a big up-and-under from Rudiger. That was no nonsense from Rudiger. That was a clearance that Peter Kaye would be proud of. David, out of play, goes for a throw. End of the extra-time first period, 1-1. Yeah, and it's... I've done too well done spin. Going self-backhand, they were clinging on. Obviously, the list of all very, very late-on in the game. Psychologically, it was a hard one to take. They were under all sorts of pressure. They couldn't get out of their own half. They had the break, and suddenly they came back a lot stronger. Held the ball really well, and they were the better team for 15 minutes. They were out, you know, destroying the Germans. And you wonder at this point in time, I mean, I don't think it's impossible that our penalties, obviously. Just thought there might be more chances. Who would you think would want the penalties more? You would imagine the Germans are quite comfortable. They've had the bad teams as well. But the Spanish record with penalties isn't brilliant, is it? No, it's not. Will we get there? We'll find out in about 15 minutes' time. Kelly. Thank you very much to Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin. Back very shortly. Emma Radikano is in action at Wimbledon. Ian Carter's watching. And she's one game away from a second appearance in her career in the fourth round at Wimbledon. That break of serve early in the second set has been consolidated. She leads it against Maria Sacarri, the ninth seed from Greece, by five games to three. So Sacarri's serving to stay in Wimbledon. And she's currently at love 30, Kelly. So things looking very encouraging for Emma Radikano. Ian Carter's going to keep us up to date with everything that happens there. And remember that there is full coverage of Wimbledon on sports extra. Our commentary match is here on Five Life Sport this evening and all the way through from this afternoon. First of all, in Stuttgart, we're going to head back for penalties very shortly in the game between Spain and Germany. And then from eight o'clock, it's commentary of France against Portugal, the match that's being built as a baffé against Ronaldo. But which one will come out on top? Let's head back to Stuttgart now with Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis. Pat, by the way, you were right. They have actually used six, the Spanish. I kind of thought that. Because I was looking at players thinking, well, you can't get injured now. But they're still in the pitch. And there are so many tired players out there just now that it would be no surprise in these last 15 minutes of play that somebody will basically be hobbling. You'll have to stick them up front and just say, be a nuisance. But at the moment, there are 11 fit-ish players left on either side and no substitute options left. So they've used both teams, they've used their full entitlement as the second period of extra time is underway. You're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds where they're going to Stuttgart, where this first quarter final, the Euros has gone to extra time. And if there's not to be another goal in the next quarter of an hour, we'll have a penalty shootout. There's Mussiala. Over the halfway line runs from Moreno. Forward ball to Wirtz. Muller's forward ball, Falkerug off the chest, tries to turn with his back to goal, pulls it back, Mussiala. They appeal for handball. There was strong penalty appeals there by Germany. So much so that when the ball then bounced to the edge of the area, none of them went to strike it. They all just shouted at Anthony Taylor from Mussiala's effort. He's going to give that. That's a stick on. Ehler on, Cuccarella was very, very fortunate for me to go away with one. His hand is low, but it's out to the side. Wow, he's not giving it. He's not giving it. Are you surprised with that? I didn't think it was deliberate handball. It's not deliberate. But when you look at some of the decisions that have been given by UEFA, when it normally strikes the hand, as here is Muller, Muller, edge of the area, Andric back out towards the left-hand side, Stuart Atwell was on VAR, Mussiala's shot saved by Seymour. But as you said, it was low down. But it was out from his body, and you'll see, that's not an unnatural possession, all that sort of stuff, right? But it was quite far out from his body, and it was maybe heading towards the goal. Maybe that's where he came down to. If it's not heading towards the goal, if it was heading just way, there's a shot on, not on target, maybe that made the decision for him, but that was a big call. Well, certainly, here is Cuccarella. Could have escaped, maybe, for Spain. Two minutes into this second period of extra time, still at 1-1. Rodgerick passes the ball to La Porte. This is Moreno coming onto it on the left-hand side. Cuccarella waits, level with the penalty area. Olmo tries to get away from Andric, drops his shoulder, accelerates, passes the ball forward, Cross comes in from the left, Rudiger on the stretch, prevents it from reaching Hossilou behind for a corner kick. One-wap! Very toned, Rudiger. Last-ditched tackle, isn't it? He's on the ground. If he doesn't get it, it's probably a goal there. He's passed through, there's... And Hossilou's going in the back, yeah, he's going in the back there. He might have got in the end of it, but still a corner kick, still an opportunity, Spain. Can't call this one. Two Spanish flags fly high behind that goal. As Spain have a corner kick far side the left, and it comes now. It's deep, headed back by La Porte, cleared by Germany to Mussiala, able to turn. He's only got Virts ahead of him, he finds him. And Mussiala now is showing the attack. Kukereya has to get back. Virts running at the heart of the Spain defence. Mussiala wants it to feed, Virts is going alone, he pulls it back. It's his full crook! Left foot, it shoots wide off target, goal kick, one-wap. But we have talked a few times about Kukereya. He was brilliant now. Absolutely brilliant. The pace he showed to get back, and he didn't dive in, he just held up players as much as possible, held up Virts, he goes to Fulcruc, there's still a half a chance there, but by that time they got the players back, and we all know that Fulcruc, he can hit a ball. Hasn't Virts had much more of an impact than Leroy Sane? Yeah, absolutely, but then sometimes if you're a wide player, it's easier to come on the centre after referees, you see doing just that, he's having a ward. Is there another ball behind the goal, so it's got to be cleared? That's the new one I see him on the favour, because he was taking his time yet again. He's already on a yellow card, let's not forget. Yeah, we're talking about Virts, when you come on the second half, there's probably more space than the first half, so it's kind of harder for the wide attacking players, but yeah, in short, he's done far more than Sane. Downfield it goes, Rudiger should tidy this one up, back towards his goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer, had to really dig that out as he fell backwards, got a lot of lift on it, Mulla gets in a bit of a tangy with Rodgery, they're appealing for a yellow card, and they get one. Rodgery, who has already been actually suspended, he missed the Albania game, not that he would have played, because they made so many changes, but he gets yet another yellow card in this tournament, he knew exactly what he was doing. I think we've all seen that one before from Rodgery, when he knows he's not going to get back, he's calculated, we've got all on his mind, not on a yellow card yet, just put it out with it, take the yellow. Rudiger with a free kick, still 1-1 in Stuttgart, goes long, full crook, downward header, directs it to the feet of Mussiala, Mussiala hits this bobbly ball, towards Mulla, Mulla's cross is deep from the left-hand side, Kukere is going to be closed down by Kimmich, they go into a thunderous challenge, Kimmich really did catch Kukere, shoulder to shoulder, and Kukere is lying flat on his back. And this time Kukere has actually been hit in the head, and there was a sore one. To be honest, I definitely should have a lot of look at that one again. He would argue it was a 50-50, he's gone on far, but he was catapulted there. I think that's a horrendous touch. I think Kimmich knows exactly what he's doing there, his weight to play around, he's not even going for the ball, if he's got the ball he's got it with his arm. Not quite Schumacher against Batistone all those years ago, in the 82 World Cup. Yeah, it's a sad answer, I think, to be fair, it's a tough call for the referee, it's a lot of calls to the... There's a lot of pressure on, there's been a lot of extreme tackles in there, a lot of clever players playing out there as well. That one was tough. Let's go back to Wimbledon, Ian Carter. Emma Radikano is through to the last 16, she's won in straight sets against the ninth seed, Maria Sacari 6-2-6-3, only the second time in her career, she's beaten top ten opposition, and for the second time in her career, Radikano through to the last 16. Continues on, sports extra, Spain are attacking, Oya Sabel, man over on this near side level, the area's Ferran Torres, Torres with the cross, it hangs in the air, Rudiger heads it up, headed further away by Kimmich, still at 1-1. We've been playing for seven minutes of this second period of extra time, penalties looming. Germany there with a quick throw, Muller, full crook had come short, and he goes long, the move breaks down. They've just got a little bit more energy back again, they can feel it. There are a few players out there, they should have kicked it out there, the Gemmas, crosses on the ground, they're barely 10 men. Oya Sabel, edge of the area, Oya Sabel with a shot, left footed, always off target. He gets a little shove there by Andre, Rudiger also has a word, wasn't a head injury, he's more than entitled to play on. I have no idea why some players think they're that important, that the game should stop because they've got a little injury. You can't go down for that, it's not a major injury, it may well be cramped, in fact it is cramped, so why are you expecting the game to be stopped? It's a nonsense. I've been talking about it before, I thought everybody using all the substitutes that somebody might end up having to basically go and goal hang. Well it could well be Tony Kruse, because that sort of level of cramp there, right at the end of the game, you shall see if he's capable of carrying. Well, he has to carry on, there's no choice. Kruse is getting treatment for cramp, there is a lot of permitted to use any more substitutes at this stage, he's got to just battle on Tony Kruse if he wishes to add to his 33 trophies that he's picked up during his career, but we're halfway through the second period of extra time and we could be going the whole hog. I was just watching that penalty shoot against Kukerella again, but they've not shown us a good enough angle from behind the goal. If you see it from behind the goal, if it hits his hand and it's going towards goal, you'd expect them to give a penalty kick there. They've not shown a good enough angle to tell that yet. Meanwhile, Germany have had another player book, but it's another substitute, Schlotterbeck was booked earlier, but Brighton's Dennis Undab has been shown a yellow card for speaking out of turn to referee Anthony Taylor. So Undab has been booked. Get the calculator out for the bookings here, so many of them. 13. Clearance from Neuer. That would have been a record in the history of the European Championships, had it not been for that contest between the Czech Republic and Turkey, but a combination of 19 cards, 17 yellows and two reds, was shown earlier on in the competition. Kukerella gets it out to the left-hand side. This is with Olmo on that far side, tries to turn away from André. Hosselou has come short, created a space for Moreno to run into. That was a sharp turn by Olmo, goes to ground, gets himself back to his feet. Olmo passes the ball, edge of the area, crosses there. André has gone back to the left-hand side. That was a close-up by Kymik. Clearance wasn't the best by Kymik, and Spain have got it back, with Olmo over on that far side yet again. Moreno with his short, dark hair, waits. Olmo still keeping it tight between themselves, very congested. Olmo is told to get to his feet as he was sent tumbling. Back it goes to Neuer, closed down by two Spanish players, sweep it long. André, Oonoh, Seymour. Seymour almost trying to do it just now. And again, Fouker allegedly off the ball. Slightly too many players going down too easily now, which is a bit infuriating. Again, it's a tough one for the referee. They're coming together, but as it is bad, as the players are suggesting it is, probably not most of the time. It has been feisty, hasn't it? Yeah, understandably. The great thing is, everyone's still on the pitch. They're not set off yet, so that's been managed to some degree as well. But, to be honest, I've watched that now. And see if you can do it by replays, and actually boot natural immediately for that. Because he's basically cheated. He's deliberately slowed down, thrown himself in the way of Fouker, then lain down in the ground as if he's badly injured. It's an absolute nonsense. Well, he went down from Vertz, who was running behind him. Vertz, who actually wasn't Fouker. He's on a yellow card as well, so had Anthony Taylor take an action, he would have been off. It is surprising, isn't it? 13 yellows, and we haven't had the red. Exactly, and I'm really happy Anthony Taylor didn't panic there and do that. And, by the way, he's out again, natural. Four minutes remain in extra time. Otherwise, we've got the drama of a penalty shootout. 1-1, Kimmich's forward ball. Good save by Oeno Simon. Fouker did ever so well to get something on it. He's forward, and Oeno Simon away to his right, made the save. There's so little space for Fouker, but he always seems to get in front, and he gets a little neck there, a brilliant little header. Not quite enough per on it there, but he's had two great opportunities that's given. Once he's at the post, same thing, goalkeeper's been equal to it. Now, Natcio has gone down onto his haunches in that challenge with Fouker. Simon was instructed by his coach, Luis Delafuente, to put the ball out of play. He's back down on his haunches again, is that his Natcio. But the Germans aren't happy, they think this is time-wasting. Well, it was wasting everybody's time when it went down before. They're just not sure about it, that's the only holding, an odd possession, as if he's pulled something in his thigh, or just above his knee. No choice, mate, you either go off the pitch or you carry on. Is it worth remembering that statistic of Spain never beating a host nation in a major tournament, and in each of their last three, they've been drawn and they've been eliminated on penalties. Russia in the last 16 in 2018 World Cup, South Korea in the World Cup in 2002, and who, in England at least, will ever forget England at Euro 96, the quarter-finals, even for those who have 11% of English heritage, as the ball is cleared away downfield by Simon, but we're 1-1 and we're edging ever closer, and it goes through towards Neuer in Germany, who've won all six penalty shootouts at the major tournament since losing to that Ponenka chip in the Euro final of 1976, as the host nation. As we get close down, you mentioned Ponenka. Is anyone going to be brave enough on a shootout? I think I know, I think somebody will. I've got a fair idea who it will be. I think it's going to be David Deyvult, your hunch. Carvajal. He's just got that about. Really nice, he's one of them. Hey, if... I certainly think if Habers had been on the pitch, he might have been tempted by it too, because he's got that sort of bravery. Carvajal, who scored the decisive penalty when Spain won the Nations League against Croatia, is on the ball here now on this near side, the right. 111, 5 live, and BBC sounds. We've got 60 seconds remaining. Kukere, passes the ball out wide. Cross comes in from the left. Moreno with the header! Moreno inside the six-shot area with the knockout blow, surely. And Spain finally would have banished the Houda against the host nation. Right at the end, they lead by two goals to one. Miquel Moreno! What a header! We just didn't see it coming, because both teams looked like they had nothing left. They were just beginning to play out the end of the game. But they get the ball on the left-hand side there. Kimmich does not get close enough, and he managed to get that ball into the centre there. But the amount of time that he's got, there is nobody within yards of him. Rudiger, who's probably the best defender, marker that you've got in this championship, absolutely nowhere near him. That may well be partly due to a little injury, but the ball was put in, and he had acres of space. Beautiful little head there into the back corner, and, well, they can't see him coming back from that, can you? He climbed high. He's up a body twisted. He directed it to the right of Manuel Noyer, and with three minutes of added-on time in extra time. Spain might finally at the tenth attempt have beaten the host nation at a major tournament. Meanwhile, somebody, I think, there's something going on behind the crowd, because Anthony Taylor has been... directed towards the Spanish bench, who's been shown a yellow card. Fabian has been shown a yellow card, celebrating as a substitute. So Fabian has been shown a yellow, but the Spanish bench aren't happy with something that has occurred behind, in that little section of support behind them. It's kind of weird, though, because that's it on players. I mean, I'm sure the Attebal doesn't give a stuff at that point in time. You know, you can maybe just have a complete another hero, just now. Play is back underway. Spain lead by two goals to one, and the crowd in Stuttgart, if you're not of Spanish persuasion, has been silenced. Hosselou back, heads it away, cleared by Ferran Torres. Three minutes of additional time. Three minutes, there's that. The madness that was going on, you couldn't tell. At some point, you wouldn't be surprised now if they go and just lob one into the middle and get another half chance to the Germans now. Must be a temptation if they got a corner kick for Noyer to come up as well. Dela Fuente is having to marshal his own substitutes, telling them to get back, ball forward, up towards Mussiala, prods it, edge of the area, Kimmig with a shot, blocked by the legs of La Porte, still inside the penalty area, hook goalwards, headed away, and then hook clear by Oya Saval. Still made with a drama, isn't over here on five live, and BBC sounds. Spain lead by two goals to one, now they can counterattack. Ferran Torres is away. Torres into the penalty area, Torres to finish it, he's put it wide, didn't even back go wide. They were ready to celebrate, they were all off the bench, down below. It's absolutely mayhem now, you've got to get up centre-forward now. They have just got to go for the Hill Mary Bowl. They've done it before, they've done it with Full Crook already in this competition, they need to put one in there. Ball goes long, Full Crook is up there, edge of the area, Oya Saval clatters it away, by my watch we're inside the last 40 seconds, almost collected it far side the left. He'll surely keep hold of the ball, he runs into the penalty area and he goes straight towards Noya, why didn't he go to the corner flag? I can tell you why, it's because he's pulled his hamstring, it can't run. Germany meanwhile attack, Wirtz far side the right, looking for a dramatic equaliser. Wirtz, who took us into extra time in the 89th minute to make it 1-1. Germany pass the ball out towards the right, Cross comes in, Full Crook with a header, planting wide, that was the moment. That was that, I thought if we'd get a chance, I was absolutely convinced we'd get a chance, that is a good chance. Now he's in front of the goal, but Full Crook is as good as anyone there. And the referee is walking up towards goalkeeper, what's he doing? I mean, there's three Spanish players down there claiming cramp, referees ignoring them as much as they possibly can, I think he should ignore them completely. The Spanish bench down below are ready to celebrate to a man. Every single one of them down there in that technical area, aligning up willing referee Anthony Taylor to blow his whistle. However, Danny Olmo has made it to the edge of the centre circle and he's still gone down with cramp, so there is a further delay. By my watch, we're now into the fourth minute. We had a minimum of three, Marata embraces an official down below. They're ready to celebrate, Ars Fane, they're leading by two goals to one. Una Simon goes long, gets plenty of distance, Andric wins the challenge, free kick to Svane, that's not Germany wanted. It's the Spanish supporters who celebrate, that surely is it. That's a big, big call there from the referee, because it doesn't seem to be a huge amount in that. Germany got the ball back again, they were going to launch another attack, but they're not going to get a chance to do that now. Spain are killing every single second, every time the ball goes out, somebody goes down, I'm not going to say Fane and Injury, but saying they've got cramps, saying there's something wrong, just trying to kill these last few seconds left. Miguel Moreno, he won the under-19 euros, the under-21 euros, under Luis Delafuente, and he's kept up his target of claiming a hat-trick, because Spain are moments away from a place in the semi-finals. They thought that was it, the substitutes are already running on the pitch to celebrate, and the fourth official has said get back off the field, because Germany have got one last chance. Mussi Ahrle, oh, Carvajal takes him down by the neck. Carvajal's already been booked, Carvajal will be sent off here, and there is the red from Anthony Taylor. Carvajal with a desperate bit of action, there's a shred from Carvajal. As one of those moments, he knows he's never getting back, he's done it before, and as he's done it, I think he's realised, I've blown it now, I'm going off. Has he taken one for the team? Has he just not got any energy? He threw himself, definitely needs to go off, great thing to do, and Germany have yet another last chance. A second yellow card, the first had ruled him out of the semi-final anyway. Carvajal was left with no choice, he trudges off, Spain are down to ten, late drama. He doesn't try Joff, he's still not off the pitch yet. The fourth official says please leave the field of play, but this free kick now for Germany, it's now or never. We had three minutes, a minimum of added on time. No, he has up. We're now into the seventh, in it comes, claimed by Simon, and he stays down, and the referee, Anthony Taylor, blows the full-time whistle, and Germany, the host nation, are out. The first host nation to be ever eliminated at the quarter-final stage, and Spain progress by two goals to one after extra time. I mean, extra revenue, and so much was happening at the end, so many exhausted players. I don't know who does have to win that game, it was really, really tight. I don't think they could have managed penalty kicks in, they were so exhausted. The one-group of players, the two-groups of players, they'll be very, very happy with this game, as the ones that are following this one, because there are so many exhausted players, there's so many injured players, there are going to be so many suspended players from these two teams there. But Spain have managed, by who could by group, to get through, and Germany, afterwards, been a very good competition for them, are going out, and I do feel sorry for them, because they gave our right good go today. So, late drama with the sending off of Carvajal, and also with Moreno's winning goal in the 119th minute, as the Spanish supporters celebrate in Stuttgart, they've knocked out Germany by two goals to one. Kelly. Ian Dennis, Sam Patnevin in Stuttgart for that game. Pat, it was a slow burner, but when it caught fire, it really caught fire. It was incredible. And you had no idea where it was going to go at the end. You talk about tactics, and tactics and changes in the system, they all happened, and they were happening every 30 seconds in this game. But after a while, they became much more human than that. It just became who was going to be least exhausted at the end, who was going to switch off for that second, and in the end, it turned out to be the Germans. A simple ball into the middle from the left-hand side, header it in the air post, and, you know, I do feel sorry for the Germans, because they've been great hosts of this tournament. They have improved as it's come along. They were the better team, and looked at the end of that nine minutes, and they were just going to cruise ahead in this. But well done, Spain. They came back. They're not just a pretty team. They have got some amount of grit as well, and they showed it today. Problem is, they've got grit, but they've also got a whole bunch of players missing for the semifinals. They're going to find it very hard to get through whoever they meet when they get there. They have spent every last bit of energy on this victory against Germany in Stuttgart today, as have Pat Nevin and Ian Dennis. But, Deno, I hope you've got something in the tank, because you're off to Berlin for Turkey against Netherlands tomorrow. I will see you there, but for now, to both of you, thank you very much.
