[0.00 - 5.20] P:1908.84 E:0.054679 |  Solo, Linter. There is only Inter.
[5.20 - 9.80] P:1784.22 E:0.084342 |  And I can tell you there have been times over the course of the last 24 hours here in Munich,
[9.80 - 16.20] P:1904.93 E:0.083919 |  that it has felt a little bit like there is only Inter, because their fans are here en masse.
[16.20 - 21.80] P:2083.06 E:0.084400 |  They've been going crazy because some of the real Inter legends of the past who are still involved in the club
[21.80 - 25.00] P:1986.38 E:0.087388 |  have just been on the pitch in front of us, like Javier Zinetti,
[25.00 - 29.60] P:2055.12 E:0.077744 |  a massive part of the Inter team that won the Champions League for the last time
[29.80 - 34.00] P:1877.48 E:0.078015 |  in 2010. They come here looking to win their fourth European Cup.
[34.00 - 37.80] P:1872.54 E:0.062223 |  Paris Saint-Germain have never won it. Never.
[37.80 - 41.80] P:2060.22 E:0.083264 |  Their fans are away to our left-hand side, so many of them wearing white shirts.
[41.80 - 48.40] P:1971.96 E:0.073022 |  Their coach, Luis Enrique, was actually on the pitch just a few minutes ago, standing, nodding,
[48.40 - 54.20] P:1917.64 E:0.075725 |  taking it all in like he hasn't been there, seen it, done it all before, and got the T-shirt.
[54.40 - 61.00] P:1905.08 E:0.080502 |  So here inside the stadium, we're going to have so much for you across the course of the next hour and 20 minutes before kickoff.
[61.00 - 63.00] P:2119.13 E:0.089321 |  You can follow all the action as we get ready for the game.
[63.00 - 66.10] P:1806.55 E:0.074792 |  You can listen to tonight's commentary with the final score graphics.
[66.10 - 71.40] P:1835.60 E:0.074583 |  Go to BBC iPlayer or the BBC Sport app. Click on Champions League final score.
[71.40 - 76.40] P:2035.35 E:0.086295 |  Our build-up looks like this. So our Euroleagues regulars will drop in, you know, just for a few minutes here and there.
[76.40 - 82.50] P:1913.12 E:0.076889 |  Guillain Balagay, Julien Laurent, James Horncastle periodically arriving in the commentary position.
[82.50 - 84.70] P:2006.81 E:0.083562 |  Loads of big names on the way as well.
[84.70 - 92.70] P:1946.55 E:0.077042 |  We're going to hear from Champions League winner here at the Allianz Arena with Chelsea Petrček, a PSG cult hero, JJ Akocča.
[92.70 - 94.30] P:1891.37 E:0.076421 |  Gajskomendieta will hear from him.
[94.30 - 99.60] P:1895.51 E:0.082557 |  Two times a finalist with Valencia, a former teammate of both Luis Enrique and the coach.
[99.60 - 103.60] P:1883.99 E:0.071178 |  He bears so many similarities to Pep Guardiola.
[103.60 - 109.00] P:1948.90 E:0.072024 |  Stadium's brilliant. Correspondent John Murray is with us, of course, throughout the evening.
[109.00 - 111.00] P:1928.09 E:0.055990 |  Great stadium. Great-looking final.
[111.00 - 113.30] P:1838.83 E:0.090326 |  Yeah, beautiful day, beautiful evening.
[113.30 - 121.50] P:1856.90 E:0.083382 |  And if it's anything like it was last night, outside the stadium, probably about now, just when the sun is beginning to think about setting,
[121.50 - 130.40] P:1831.66 E:0.072844 |  you will, from right outside this magnificent arena, be able to see very clearly the Alps etched against the horizon to the south.
[130.40 - 133.00] P:1856.93 E:0.082906 |  It's a great city to host a final like this.
[133.00 - 134.50] P:1979.59 E:0.068008 |  It's a great stadium.
[134.50 - 140.00] P:1803.06 E:0.065295 |  I was in the English Garden this morning and it was absolutely stunning.
[140.00 - 144.30] P:1816.94 E:0.066965 |  It was verdant. It was green. The temperature was wonderful.
[144.30 - 150.40] P:1884.60 E:0.079764 |  However, that's as close as we're going to get to anything English involved in this Champions League final.
[150.40 - 154.70] P:1882.21 E:0.069850 |  Nevertheless, there is still plenty to attract us and entertain us.
[154.70 - 155.90] P:1771.43 E:0.050994 |  I hope this evening.
[155.90 - 161.00] P:1994.09 E:0.080121 |  This is also the closest that you and I will ever get to the European Cup,
[161.00 - 167.90] P:1888.35 E:0.079083 |  because we're about what sort of 30 rows back pitch side here, just about 10, 15 meters away from the halfway line, John.
[167.90 - 169.00] P:1796.65 E:0.088049 |  And there it is.
[169.00 - 176.80] P:1893.50 E:0.073807 |  And how many times we do programs and we're standing next to trophies and you talk about the trophy and you describe it and you say it's gleaming away,
[176.80 - 178.60] P:1844.36 E:0.086848 |  there's nothing like the European Cup.
[178.60 - 182.50] P:1842.42 E:0.078197 |  It's so much bigger than it looks on the TV as well.
[182.50 - 190.10] P:1926.00 E:0.087861 |  Yeah, and I think anyone who has had any love and interest for football in Europe, that trophy means so much to them.
[190.10 - 197.70] P:1883.28 E:0.094945 |  And when I was growing up, you know, they were the start of those incredible glory years for the English clubs in the late 70s.
[197.70 - 200.70] P:1891.43 E:0.097805 |  And the early 80s, which was started by Liverpool.
[200.70 - 205.80] P:1829.14 E:0.101905 |  And I always remember the sort of grainy footage that I'd be watching at the time of the UEFA President.
[205.80 - 214.80] P:1807.38 E:0.093839 |  I think he was at the time Artemio Francki, who would always enjoy his moment as he was handing over that trophy down there to whoever the captain was.
[214.80 - 221.60] P:1788.58 E:0.083586 |  He would always just lift it up himself before he actually gave it to the captain of the winning team.
[221.60 - 224.70] P:1942.12 E:0.078841 |  So many great faces of European football.
[224.70 - 230.60] P:1960.70 E:0.091648 |  As we look up and down the touch line here immediately, I'm just drawn to the figure of Arsene Venger,
[230.60 - 234.80] P:1872.93 E:0.088422 |  who is right in front of us, almost looking back up to the common treat position.
[234.80 - 237.40] P:1776.65 E:0.083507 |  So tons to come from here inside the stadium.
[237.40 - 244.60] P:1769.76 E:0.089231 |  Of course, it's also a historic day for BBC television because we'll have our first ever Champions League final match of the day.
[244.60 - 247.20] P:1655.90 E:0.099040 |  Thomas Hitzelsberger, Nadar Manua, both on it.
[247.20 - 249.50] P:1467.77 E:0.087158 |  Good evening, guys.
[249.60 - 257.40] P:1734.83 E:0.094449 |  Thomas, I was really, really interested to see that you scored the second goal in this stadium.
[257.40 - 262.40] P:1733.55 E:0.092006 |  Now, that must feel special because when you were growing up on the books at Bayern before you left,
[262.40 - 266.90] P:1744.48 E:0.090877 |  this thing was just a blueprint, an idea, an acorn of what it's grown into.
[266.90 - 268.50] P:1466.90 E:0.099442 |  Well, you've just made my day.
[268.50 - 270.20] P:1467.22 E:0.112375 |  See, I remember I scored in the stadium.
[270.20 - 272.60] P:1358.04 E:0.086840 |  I didn't know I was the second goal scorer there.
[272.60 - 274.20] P:1369.46 E:0.112980 |  And as you can imagine, it's my hometown.
[274.20 - 279.10] P:1515.94 E:0.098035 |  I would love to be there in the stadium, but it's equally as nice being here with Nadar.
[279.60 - 281.40] P:1425.35 E:0.118285 |  Come and tell you the good.
[283.20 - 284.90] P:2068.75 E:0.084680 |  Nadar, you've been here this season as well.
[284.90 - 287.30] P:1801.80 E:0.080127 |  I mean, it's a heck of a stadium for a Champions League final.
[287.30 - 288.10] P:1799.70 E:0.083380 |  It's one of the greatest.
[288.10 - 289.40] P:1389.84 E:0.095146 |  Absolutely is.
[289.40 - 292.30] P:1246.47 E:0.092784 |  It was my first time going there to watch Bayern against Levekuz.
[292.30 - 293.90] P:1283.46 E:0.084611 |  And I think I was with you, Thomas, for that game.
[293.90 - 294.40] P:1305.94 E:0.102302 |  Yeah, you were.
[294.40 - 296.90] P:1401.70 E:0.085938 |  Listen, I can't go anywhere without Thomas Hitzelsberger.
[296.90 - 298.10] P:1441.83 E:0.100985 |  But do you know what I love, Steve?
[298.10 - 302.20] P:1554.96 E:0.078555 |  Like, you're at the game and we can hear the Paris Saint-Germain fans already.
[302.20 - 305.50] P:1236.04 E:0.089926 |  These two sides, for as good as they are, they're so well supported.
[305.50 - 309.00] P:1398.60 E:0.100468 |  And the noise is going to be absolutely amazing because this is an hour and 15 before kickoff.
[309.50 - 311.10] P:1266.36 E:0.102480 |  And it feels like the game's going on right now.
[311.80 - 315.00] P:1895.52 E:0.086092 |  Yeah, I mean, it was quite amazing, John, actually, wasn't it?
[315.00 - 320.30] P:1769.05 E:0.081487 |  That when the big screens were sort of lit up with the two team buses arriving,
[320.30 - 324.20] P:1869.83 E:0.085884 |  the noise for Usmann Dembele, just the picture of him getting off the bus,
[324.20 - 327.80] P:1845.61 E:0.087720 |  the noise for Lautaro Martinez just getting off the bus was immense.
[327.80 - 331.40] P:1730.82 E:0.088084 |  Well, the point is, and we should make it really right at the outset,
[331.40 - 336.20] P:1881.49 E:0.089731 |  is for these Paris Saint-Germain supporters, yes, it's their second final in this competition.
[336.20 - 340.50] P:1957.78 E:0.080591 |  But of course, the first one in 2020, Thomas Tuchel's PSG,
[340.50 - 343.40] P:1859.50 E:0.083705 |  that was the Covid final behind closed doors in Lisbon.
[343.40 - 351.70] P:1835.37 E:0.083923 |  So these fanatical and so emotional PSG supporters that have seen time and time and time and time again this season,
[351.70 - 354.50] P:1736.93 E:0.082254 |  knocking out the English clubs, beating the English clubs,
[354.50 - 358.80] P:1772.47 E:0.083620 |  they've got their chance here today to be here and witness,
[358.80 - 361.70] P:1716.49 E:0.073557 |  little like we've been talking about Liverpool recently,
[361.70 - 365.60] P:1788.10 E:0.074062 |  to witness their team tonight playing in the Champions League final.
[365.60 - 368.30] P:1795.73 E:0.078064 |  And similarly, at the other end, Inter, you know,
[368.30 - 372.10] P:1890.96 E:0.082206 |  have got recent experience of seeing their team get this far,
[372.10 - 375.20] P:1782.66 E:0.070887 |  but lose in Istanbul against Manchester City.
[375.20 - 379.20] P:1762.15 E:0.088878 |  So that's probably part of the reason why we have the atmosphere already
[379.20 - 381.80] P:1863.41 E:0.072157 |  that is coming over the airwaves.
[381.80 - 385.90] P:2022.59 E:0.064508 |  Yeah, I mean, it feels absolutely spectacular in here,
[385.90 - 388.40] P:1891.64 E:0.071763 |  an hour and 15 minutes to kick off.
[388.40 - 391.80] P:2018.31 E:0.081762 |  John's just been talking about Paris Saint-Germain's journey to this final
[391.80 - 395.30] P:2028.58 E:0.084014 |  and how they've just done for all of the English Champions League teams.
[395.30 - 399.50] P:2028.11 E:0.089707 |  So let's hear first from the man who was in front of us just a few moments ago,
[399.50 - 404.40] P:1989.43 E:0.081251 |  taking in the atmosphere inside the Allianz, the PSG boss, Lewis Enrique,
[404.40 - 411.00] P:1895.88 E:0.078311 |  whose side have beaten Pep Guardiola, Arnaz Sla, Unai Emery and Miquel Arthetta in the Champions League this season?
[411.00 - 416.60] P:1812.75 E:0.085933 |  If you think about the level of the Premier League teams,
[416.60 - 423.90] P:1598.98 E:0.083040 |  we can see the final of Europa League and also the Conference League winning for English teams.
[423.90 - 431.70] P:1669.30 E:0.068959 |  We had to play against them many times this season and I think it was tough, really tough,
[431.70 - 439.20] P:1494.33 E:0.071672 |  but at the same time we could analyse and enjoy playing our football against them
[439.20 - 441.70] P:1591.05 E:0.075689 |  and I think we deserve to win the final.
[441.70 - 444.60] P:1643.54 E:0.080702 |  Yeah, that's it. I think we are ready.
[444.60 - 451.20] P:1718.76 E:0.073761 |  I hope we can get it and that's our plan, our idea. We'll see in the future.
[451.30 - 453.10] P:1853.67 E:0.092974 |  There he is, Lewis Enrique.
[453.10 - 456.80] P:1851.91 E:0.090071 |  So correspondent John Murray is with us, Nadia Maneuwer and Thomas Hitzelsberger,
[456.80 - 459.30] P:1830.39 E:0.083022 |  Champions League analysts tonight.
[459.30 - 465.40] P:1927.98 E:0.082853 |  We've got BBC TV's first Champions League final match of the day at 11pm.
[465.40 - 468.40] P:1825.64 E:0.098361 |  I said our Euroleagues regulars will drop by from time to time.
[468.40 - 469.90] P:2093.41 E:0.097689 |  Good evening, Guillain Balagay.
[469.90 - 471.40] P:1847.12 E:0.083858 |  Good evening, Steve.
[471.40 - 474.60] P:1888.41 E:0.093774 |  And what perfect timing as we hear from Lewis Enrique
[474.60 - 478.50] P:1758.95 E:0.089872 |  and people can go and read your profile of him on the BBC Sport website.
[478.50 - 481.60] P:1834.45 E:0.068145 |  This is a huge night for him.
[481.60 - 483.50] P:1698.60 E:0.091844 |  Yes and no, yes, absolutely.
[483.50 - 486.60] P:1875.51 E:0.084308 |  He could get in trouble with PSG.
[486.60 - 488.90] P:1765.04 E:0.080143 |  He obviously is working all year for this.
[488.90 - 493.90] P:1695.83 E:0.084760 |  This is the culmination of a new era at PSG
[493.90 - 497.10] P:1769.31 E:0.080279 |  that started with the meeting with the bosses and saying,
[497.10 - 498.90] P:1424.56 E:0.081679 |  no, I don't want some of the players that are there.
[498.90 - 500.40] P:1696.62 E:0.077466 |  I want to change the culture there.
[500.40 - 504.50] P:1749.74 E:0.078714 |  So Verrati left, Neymar left, Bapé finally left as well.
[504.50 - 509.40] P:1807.61 E:0.082272 |  And yes, this is of course prestige and so much more related to it.
[509.40 - 511.50] P:1554.26 E:0.088165 |  But at the same time, I think he's one of those managers
[511.50 - 514.80] P:1756.79 E:0.067739 |  that if he loses today, not that it doesn't matter,
[514.80 - 517.60] P:1739.22 E:0.077962 |  but certainly he will move on quite quickly.
[517.60 - 520.60] P:1878.57 E:0.064897 |  He's going to do everything in his power.
[520.60 - 523.60] P:1745.13 E:0.070890 |  And he has the on decision to make this side better.
[523.60 - 524.80] P:1558.59 E:0.087385 |  But if he doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.
[524.80 - 525.80] P:1823.47 E:0.053026 |  They'll try again.
[525.80 - 528.20] P:1966.24 E:0.053017 |  You know, Thomas and Nadum,
[528.20 - 531.20] P:1996.75 E:0.085066 |  one of the things that struck me just about that little clip from Lewis Enrique,
[531.20 - 534.50] P:1952.31 E:0.073384 |  and you know, that was the answer that he gave in English.
[534.50 - 536.30] P:2067.89 E:0.091552 |  Talking about the Premier League teams, he said, oh yeah,
[536.30 - 538.80] P:1940.50 E:0.075527 |  but we could analyze and enjoy.
[538.80 - 544.10] P:1957.24 E:0.084779 |  I wonder if you can both analyze and enjoy taking on this into Milan team
[544.10 - 546.70] P:1901.04 E:0.081641 |  because they're not just like a, they are resolute,
[546.70 - 548.10] P:1940.44 E:0.081245 |  but they're not just resolute.
[548.10 - 549.40] P:1038.03 E:0.106077 |  No, no, not at all.
[549.40 - 552.00] P:1528.63 E:0.081918 |  I think in the group phase of the Champions League,
[552.00 - 555.00] P:1331.73 E:0.094658 |  they did feel resolute in the fact that I think they had the best defensive record
[555.00 - 557.60] P:1607.83 E:0.088264 |  going into the knockouts and they didn't score a ton of goals.
[557.60 - 559.60] P:1236.72 E:0.092979 |  So yes, it's felt as if the games that they're involved in
[559.60 - 562.90] P:1545.13 E:0.090895 |  were a little bit on the, not necessarily hard to watch,
[562.90 - 566.80] P:1217.48 E:0.083089 |  but not as glamorous as say, watching Barcelona, for example,
[566.80 - 569.30] P:1457.73 E:0.077569 |  who end up leaving as top scorers in competition.
[569.30 - 570.60] P:1110.30 E:0.102889 |  But then as soon as they went to the knockouts,
[570.60 - 573.10] P:1574.35 E:0.074003 |  they found a different way because they had to score.
[573.10 - 576.00] P:1282.13 E:0.095526 |  So many times where, you know, the other team is potentially taking it to them
[576.00 - 577.40] P:1658.88 E:0.071361 |  and they found a way.
[577.40 - 579.20] P:1330.41 E:0.098570 |  And then before you know it, you know, they're playing in classics
[579.20 - 581.60] P:1244.01 E:0.097624 |  like that two-legged tie against Barcelona the round before.
[581.60 - 587.10] P:1674.49 E:0.089975 |  So yeah, it's really interesting because this interside through the knockouts,
[587.10 - 588.30] P:1752.24 E:0.092809 |  they've changed my perception of them.
[588.30 - 589.20] P:1818.41 E:0.084577 |  I don't know if you'd agree, Thomas.
[589.20 - 590.40] P:1685.25 E:0.122099 |  Well, I do agree.
[590.40 - 593.90] P:1927.51 E:0.106607 |  The thing is, obviously, I enjoy watching PSG going forward,
[593.90 - 597.40] P:1732.22 E:0.096668 |  all the individual players, how they work as a team.
[597.40 - 602.20] P:1635.96 E:0.096381 |  But then I think Inter's game against Bayern at the Alans Arena changed my perception,
[602.20 - 605.30] P:1945.73 E:0.106391 |  actually started to enjoy watching the team defend
[605.30 - 609.40] P:1905.96 E:0.096770 |  because the way Inter defend, they seem to have joy in sitting back
[609.40 - 610.90] P:1600.74 E:0.117114 |  and waiting for that perfect moment.
[610.90 - 613.90] P:1765.56 E:0.094540 |  That's when they hurt Bayern, when they scored the winner.
[613.90 - 616.40] P:1654.29 E:0.095178 |  That for me was, that is brilliant football
[616.40 - 620.40] P:1547.19 E:0.089862 |  because when we talk about here, who's a better team?
[620.40 - 622.80] P:1628.50 E:0.098948 |  And PSG, they beat four Premier League teams.
[622.80 - 627.20] P:1493.15 E:0.094428 |  This is always the English perspective, but we haven't probably seen enough of Inter.
[627.20 - 629.50] P:1649.26 E:0.096288 |  The teams, they beat, the way they beat them.
[629.50 - 631.70] P:1713.79 E:0.106015 |  That's why I really have huge respect for Inter
[631.70 - 634.10] P:1668.78 E:0.067803 |  and that's why I say this is 50-50 tonight.
[634.10 - 635.70] P:1816.72 E:0.091948 |  In about three, four days I've been in Munich
[635.70 - 637.90] P:1720.56 E:0.086618 |  and I haven't found a single person that goes like,
[637.90 - 641.10] P:1780.29 E:0.073373 |  PSG is going to win or Inter is going to win.
[641.10 - 644.40] P:1653.95 E:0.075199 |  It's just, in a way, like the perfect movie, isn't it?
[644.40 - 649.00] P:1729.38 E:0.081711 |  With an uncertain ending, two main characters that are completely different.
[649.00 - 652.50] P:1943.35 E:0.084849 |  Two brands of football, a young club in PSG
[652.50 - 656.10] P:1869.84 E:0.083052 |  and one that has won three European Cups in Inter.
[656.10 - 659.30] P:1851.58 E:0.091609 |  A team that's starting to be built, if you like, in PSG,
[659.30 - 662.00] P:1685.48 E:0.085374 |  but one that perhaps today will be the last time
[662.00 - 664.20] P:1875.10 E:0.076454 |  they're together in a changing room at Inter.
[664.20 - 668.10] P:1767.52 E:0.083464 |  And they both failed the last hurdle.
[668.10 - 672.60] P:1836.75 E:0.086282 |  They failed the lost finals recently, but they won really big games,
[672.60 - 674.90] P:1828.06 E:0.089629 |  which Lussand Rigg and the press conference called them finals.
[674.90 - 677.00] P:1903.13 E:0.076346 |  This season, they won big games.
[677.00 - 681.00] P:1898.05 E:0.085434 |  So they're capable of almost beating anything that's in their way.
[681.00 - 684.20] P:1852.23 E:0.080846 |  So I don't know, has anybody got an answer to this?
[684.20 - 685.20] P:1636.90 E:0.072906 |  No.
[685.20 - 687.00] P:1891.07 E:0.089857 |  But that is what makes it great, Thomas.
[687.00 - 688.80] P:1983.15 E:0.094949 |  And actually, just as Guy was talking about,
[688.80 - 692.00] P:1860.46 E:0.087159 |  finding it really difficult to stop looking at the European Cup,
[692.00 - 693.40] P:1871.70 E:0.086720 |  it's really hard.
[693.40 - 695.70] P:1957.26 E:0.079281 |  Arsene Wenger's just standing in front of it now.
[695.70 - 698.20] P:1885.11 E:0.089766 |  And it's got these sort of red and blue ribbons,
[698.30 - 702.90] P:1994.77 E:0.090641 |  somewhere sort of between PSG, red, blue and Inter, dark, blue and black
[702.90 - 704.20] P:1931.74 E:0.067114 |  on it at the moment.
[704.20 - 706.20] P:1875.21 E:0.086137 |  I was thinking, why does it look a bit weird?
[706.20 - 708.60] P:1870.59 E:0.087905 |  And it looks weird because it hasn't got white ribbons on it.
[708.60 - 709.90] P:1940.66 E:0.077665 |  That's why it looks weird.
[709.90 - 712.50] P:1983.55 E:0.090366 |  It's a Champions League final without an English team
[712.50 - 715.00] P:1806.51 E:0.092770 |  and the might they bring, Thomas, and without Real Madrid.
[715.00 - 717.40] P:1874.72 E:0.071448 |  That's one of the reasons it feels different.
[717.40 - 719.30] P:1529.26 E:0.108762 |  Well, of course, I totally understand it
[719.30 - 722.90] P:1707.72 E:0.090268 |  because at the beginning of the season, we were talking about the format
[722.90 - 724.20] P:1921.45 E:0.080436 |  and favourites.
[724.20 - 728.00] P:1720.78 E:0.095674 |  I did not think of PSG or Inter to get to the final,
[728.00 - 729.90] P:1798.28 E:0.097730 |  but of course, now they're in the final.
[729.90 - 731.40] P:1843.65 E:0.087719 |  I said that they both deserve it.
[731.40 - 734.50] P:1880.42 E:0.096030 |  The only other team that I could see in the final
[734.50 - 737.10] P:1809.11 E:0.083857 |  and say it's justified is Barcelona.
[737.10 - 740.40] P:1778.72 E:0.097297 |  I think we've all watched both semi-finals between Inter and Barcelona.
[740.40 - 741.40] P:1575.55 E:0.090073 |  That was a spectacle.
[741.40 - 742.80] P:1809.35 E:0.079588 |  Both games were.
[742.80 - 744.80] P:1535.70 E:0.109954 |  And that's why this is really, really amazing.
[744.80 - 746.20] P:1318.31 E:0.093602 |  There have been some amazing teams.
[746.20 - 748.80] P:1576.91 E:0.101734 |  We look at Liverpool, the way the season was going.
[748.80 - 750.60] P:1627.28 E:0.086271 |  I thought, where'd they go all the way?
[750.60 - 753.40] P:1664.19 E:0.098498 |  And today tonight is going to be absolutely phenomenal.
[753.40 - 756.00] P:1841.25 E:0.086390 |  And I think that people got so much to look forward to.
[756.00 - 758.60] P:1442.21 E:0.101582 |  And as I said, I can't predict anybody that made them.
[758.60 - 760.10] P:1634.06 E:0.118090 |  I'm sure you always get it right.
[760.10 - 761.60] P:1258.27 E:0.089317 |  Absolutely. I never get it right.
[761.60 - 762.60] P:1689.98 E:0.055136 |  That's the problem.
[762.60 - 764.70] P:1355.31 E:0.104272 |  I think in regards to these two teams as well,
[764.70 - 767.60] P:1619.62 E:0.092872 |  what's really interesting from the variation is that Paris Saint-Germain
[767.60 - 771.70] P:1630.46 E:0.080430 |  two games to go in the group phase were outside of qualifying for the knockouts.
[771.70 - 774.20] P:1577.91 E:0.091857 |  Whereas for Inter, I feel like they've always been in the top eight.
[774.20 - 778.20] P:1782.79 E:0.074124 |  So their route to this point has always felt a bit clearer.
[778.20 - 779.70] P:1451.52 E:0.095155 |  We've understood how good they are.
[779.70 - 781.00] P:1482.51 E:0.082347 |  We've understood that for the last few years,
[781.00 - 784.30] P:1744.14 E:0.086266 |  there's been a team who would have a belief that they can go and win the whole thing.
[784.30 - 786.60] P:1579.58 E:0.097709 |  Whereas with Paris, we had doubts in that first phase.
[786.60 - 789.20] P:1740.70 E:0.091201 |  We had doubts because like Julian, when he comes on,
[789.20 - 792.10] P:1443.19 E:0.096433 |  he will say how they played well, but in reality, they lost games.
[792.10 - 792.80] P:1582.17 E:0.062256 |  Sorry, again.
[794.80 - 796.90] P:2063.69 E:0.105601 |  No, sorry, that was just me laughing at you, Ned.
[796.90 - 797.70] P:1879.85 E:0.113603 |  I'm sorry. Yeah.
[797.70 - 800.20] P:1946.75 E:0.091622 |  Do you want like, I'm throwing it forward to when Jules arrives
[800.20 - 802.40] P:1794.23 E:0.083201 |  and tries to pretend that Paris Saint-Germain aren't favourites.
[802.40 - 805.00] P:1299.22 E:0.095026 |  Well, yeah, of course, that's the way you protect yourself as a human being,
[805.00 - 806.50] P:1411.32 E:0.094782 |  isn't it? Especially about your football club.
[806.50 - 809.50] P:1520.57 E:0.091663 |  But in that first few games, they were losing losing games of football
[809.50 - 812.30] P:1523.57 E:0.072485 |  whilst having tons of chances and they had question marks around them.
[812.30 - 813.70] P:1522.62 E:0.097082 |  Then they played against some man city side.
[813.70 - 816.40] P:1773.28 E:0.079154 |  I think in the penultimate game and they destroyed them.
[817.20 - 822.30] P:1575.30 E:0.090558 |  And that kind of was a way to let you see what was coming next
[822.30 - 824.00] P:1503.30 E:0.094919 |  because I believe they won their next game.
[824.00 - 827.10] P:1601.08 E:0.087832 |  Then they destroyed breasts, I think in the in the next stage.
[827.10 - 828.70] P:1325.19 E:0.095979 |  And before you know it, they come up against all the teams.
[828.70 - 832.30] P:1664.42 E:0.080944 |  As Thomas has said, there's obviously very much an English bias here.
[832.30 - 836.00] P:1767.74 E:0.100575 |  But of course, you know, telling the front three to really work for the team
[836.00 - 838.20] P:1693.82 E:0.085194 |  and then Billy is the player that stands out.
[838.20 - 841.50] P:1805.09 E:0.102331 |  And once Luis and Ricky managed to get hold of them and say,
[841.50 - 843.10] P:1576.66 E:0.092025 |  listen, you've got a job to do for the team.
[843.10 - 846.30] P:1736.86 E:0.101384 |  And once you do this, it makes your life easier going forward
[846.30 - 848.30] P:1788.89 E:0.077907 |  and creating chances and scoring goals.
[848.30 - 849.60] P:1871.58 E:0.095703 |  And that for me was key.
[849.60 - 853.80] P:1808.00 E:0.087543 |  Some of the big names have left the club and some other young big names
[853.80 - 854.60] P:1749.55 E:0.099063 |  are already there.
[854.60 - 857.60] P:1645.78 E:0.102551 |  And to be fair, if they don't win tonight, I can see them do it next season
[857.60 - 858.30] P:1199.18 E:0.113030 |  or the season after.
[858.30 - 860.20] P:1199.30 E:0.090858 |  Let's talk about next season. Let's talk about the now.
[860.20 - 862.40] P:1657.06 E:0.077854 |  So how about this then for you, Thomas?
[862.40 - 865.50] P:1538.16 E:0.092836 |  Do you prefer to be the side that is older and more experienced
[865.50 - 870.00] P:1416.97 E:0.087149 |  and into Milan or the young side with in all those legs and that youthful exuberance?
[870.00 - 871.00] P:1646.44 E:0.089168 |  Which would you rather be today?
[871.00 - 874.10] P:1659.90 E:0.105157 |  Well, if I was a fan, of course, I preferred on the PSG side
[874.10 - 876.70] P:1738.91 E:0.100431 |  because there's so much to look forward to over the next few years.
[876.70 - 880.20] P:1775.10 E:0.086247 |  And with Inter, as well as Simone Insaghi is done,
[880.20 - 882.60] P:1467.33 E:0.081353 |  you don't know what's going to happen next season.
[882.60 - 886.80] P:1661.27 E:0.093585 |  And in this Serie A, they've just missed out to Win the Scudetto.
[886.80 - 891.80] P:1661.16 E:0.096708 |  It's always the age when you look at Italian teams are usually always a bit older than the rest,
[891.80 - 893.00] P:1215.81 E:0.091462 |  but they seem to pull it off.
[893.00 - 895.70] P:1547.27 E:0.092687 |  Do you think now is the time where they need to change again?
[895.70 - 897.20] P:1558.91 E:0.098908 |  And the next season, they're still there.
[897.20 - 898.80] P:1493.03 E:0.098648 |  So I admire them, what they've done.
[898.80 - 900.70] P:1687.44 E:0.085138 |  But PC is probably the team I would pick.
[900.70 - 903.20] P:1516.54 E:0.091869 |  Oh, he said it's team. That's it.
[903.20 - 904.20] P:1696.06 E:0.045841 |  There you go.
[904.20 - 906.80] P:2026.08 E:0.097158 |  Naden, Thomas, thank you both very much indeed.
[906.80 - 909.00] P:2149.48 E:0.083556 |  Enjoy Champions League final match of the day.
[909.00 - 909.60] P:2003.05 E:0.095036 |  It'll be great.
[911.40 - 913.40] P:1891.02 E:0.101539 |  Naden Manura and Thomas Hitzelsberger there.
[913.40 - 914.10] P:1917.78 E:0.095837 |  Who will be with you?
[914.10 - 916.00] P:1878.53 E:0.077622 |  BBC 11, 11 p.m.
[916.00 - 917.90] P:1931.86 E:0.080471 |  John Murray, we have the team news.
[917.90 - 921.60] P:1959.55 E:0.091484 |  We've got the team news and it's pretty much as we expected.
[921.60 - 924.60] P:1689.40 E:0.079813 |  But I think the headlines, one headline for both.
[924.70 - 930.40] P:1784.01 E:0.086831 |  The fact that for PSG, it is Desiree Due, who starts rather than Barcola.
[930.40 - 935.40] P:1763.44 E:0.082310 |  So Barcola is among the substitutes, but the PSG team, Donor Omarengol,
[935.40 - 941.90] P:1843.65 E:0.079422 |  Hakimi Marquinhos, Paco and Nunomendes, then Vettiniya with Juan Neves and Fabian Ruiz,
[941.90 - 947.60] P:1884.07 E:0.087945 |  and then the front line for the final of Desiree Due, Gambele and Cabaret Scalia.
[947.60 - 951.00] P:1885.61 E:0.080924 |  So Barcola on the bench for PSG.
[951.00 - 959.00] P:1878.62 E:0.080570 |  And the headline for Inter is that the former Bayern Munich man, Benjamin Pavard, is fit.
[959.00 - 964.80] P:1952.28 E:0.079211 |  Yesterday, in Zargi said, only if he is 100% fit will he start.
[964.80 - 969.80] P:1813.02 E:0.077241 |  But he said if he is 100% fit, he will definitely start and he starts.
[969.80 - 972.40] P:1890.98 E:0.072653 |  So Bisseck is on the substitutes bench.
[972.40 - 977.80] P:1780.68 E:0.071742 |  So Summer Engel, Pavard, a chairbeat and Bastoni, the three central defenders,
[977.80 - 980.50] P:1786.24 E:0.075420 |  then Dumfries and DiMarco as the wing backs.
[980.50 - 985.70] P:1717.03 E:0.068697 |  Chalannoglu, Barela and McIterian and Turan and Lautaro Martínez up front.
[985.70 - 988.30] P:1861.78 E:0.094296 |  All right, so we're going to have loads of time to dissect that,
[988.30 - 993.40] P:1809.01 E:0.070236 |  but Guillem, just before we let you go, looking at that inter-line-up,
[993.40 - 999.40] P:1821.31 E:0.067184 |  where is the area of most concern for Luis Enrique?
[999.40 - 1006.30] P:1822.25 E:0.070959 |  To be honest, if Inter Milan do what they do well and they've done most of the season,
[1006.30 - 1009.70] P:1779.11 E:0.072686 |  which is to defend well on the edge of the box and around the box,
[1009.70 - 1014.50] P:1764.77 E:0.065788 |  the danger is if the midfielders steal the ball and counterattack,
[1014.50 - 1019.50] P:1865.95 E:0.079003 |  because even though PSG is a structured team and they will try to defend themselves for that
[1019.50 - 1023.50] P:1773.45 E:0.082587 |  and be together when they attack as well, so if they lose it, they're there to recover it,
[1023.50 - 1026.70] P:1835.67 E:0.078727 |  there will be occasions, especially in the first hour, 70 minutes,
[1026.70 - 1031.70] P:1804.81 E:0.069291 |  where Inter will be able to counterattack and if that happens, they're very, very, very good at it.
[1031.70 - 1035.70] P:1890.28 E:0.064501 |  But if he gets to the minute 70 and nothing has happened, I think I'll give...
[1035.70 - 1038.50] P:1892.10 E:0.077107 |  I'll mortgage my house on PSG then.
[1038.50 - 1039.70] P:1750.50 E:0.094276 |  Don't do that.
[1039.70 - 1040.90] P:1947.13 E:0.080914 |  Thank you, Guillem. Cheers.
[1040.90 - 1042.50] P:2049.35 E:0.103977 |  That's Guillem Balagay from the Euroleague.
[1042.50 - 1044.40] P:1842.55 E:0.081255 |  James Horncastle dropped by at some point.
[1044.40 - 1046.70] P:1866.37 E:0.091706 |  Julianne LeRonal dropped by at some point.
[1046.70 - 1049.30] P:1927.74 E:0.087890 |  We'll be speaking to Danny Murphy as well shortly.
[1049.30 - 1053.20] P:1872.95 E:0.090925 |  Your summariser for the TV coverage, the highlights later at the Champions League final.
[1053.20 - 1058.10] P:1948.16 E:0.089450 |  We have got just over an hour to go until full commentary of Inter Milan
[1058.10 - 1061.70] P:1903.20 E:0.084925 |  against Paris Saint-Germain from Munich to Paris and Roland Garros.
[1061.70 - 1063.60] P:1924.99 E:0.077384 |  We'll talk Jack Draper in a moment.
[1063.60 - 1067.30] P:1933.56 E:0.081522 |  First of all, though, there's that all British clash taking place.
[1067.30 - 1071.60] P:1976.89 E:0.071723 |  Cam Norrie against Jacob Fernley and Abigail Johnson is watching.
[1071.60 - 1074.80] P:1658.84 E:0.087449 |  And I can tell you there is no escaping the football factor here.
[1074.80 - 1078.60] P:1810.79 E:0.086059 |  Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fernley on Cours Simon Matieu,
[1078.60 - 1083.10] P:1763.42 E:0.085838 |  which is at the very edge of the grounds, playing through fireworks and car horns.
[1083.10 - 1086.90] P:1712.07 E:0.084323 |  It's all been a little much for the British number two, Jacob Fernley, so far.
[1086.90 - 1091.90] P:1692.36 E:0.088726 |  He's in his first ever Roland Garros third round up against a man who's he's called inspiring.
[1091.90 - 1097.00] P:1660.62 E:0.086052 |  Cameron Norrie, former World Number Eight and also a graduate of Texas Christian University.
[1097.00 - 1103.50] P:1814.21 E:0.089221 |  A little erratic from Fernley, but he has forced the second set tiebreak here after Norrie took the opener.
[1103.50 - 1107.10] P:1774.72 E:0.068755 |  It is Norrie, though, four points to one up in the tiebreak.
[1107.10 - 1112.30] P:1821.57 E:0.064099 |  And this follows, doesn't it? Just a ruthless performance from Jack Draper.
[1112.30 - 1115.80] P:1738.68 E:0.085679 |  It was utterly impressive from the current World Number Five
[1115.80 - 1120.30] P:1889.37 E:0.085135 |  and shows how much Jack Draper has grown over the past 12 months.
[1120.30 - 1123.80] P:1805.45 E:0.072085 |  He lost in the first round here in five sets last season.
[1123.80 - 1126.70] P:1659.60 E:0.089543 |  The body is stronger. The focus is linear.
[1126.70 - 1131.40] P:1782.60 E:0.091040 |  He was up against Brazilian teenage sensation, Joel Fonseca, who's been junior World Number One.
[1131.40 - 1135.10] P:1760.84 E:0.080960 |  He dominated. He controlled with the serve and from the back of the court
[1135.10 - 1137.00] P:1784.21 E:0.073211 |  and he kept it to the clinical straight sets.
[1137.00 - 1140.80] P:1821.69 E:0.065663 |  That could mean a lot going deeper into the tournament.
[1140.80 - 1144.70] P:1943.89 E:0.077744 |  And we've got the main event. Haven't we still to come on Chatterier?
[1144.70 - 1146.90] P:1851.12 E:0.094629 |  It is the main event. It's the night session.
[1146.90 - 1153.10] P:1659.29 E:0.085452 |  Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam champion, will be up against the qualifier from Austria, Philip Misalich.
[1153.10 - 1157.10] P:1721.95 E:0.081257 |  But Misalich, who's never been ranked inside the World's Top 120,
[1157.10 - 1160.80] P:1702.83 E:0.089178 |  might be a little thankful that there's a certain big football match going on
[1160.80 - 1165.30] P:1768.05 E:0.083595 |  because it's going to be incredibly overwhelming walking out onto the biggest show court
[1165.30 - 1168.00] P:1750.46 E:0.080674 |  to take on one of the greatest athletes of all time,
[1168.00 - 1171.40] P:1607.26 E:0.086029 |  having never had the experience of being inside the World's Top 100.
[1171.40 - 1175.40] P:1828.65 E:0.069158 |  Big task for Misalich tonight against the three-time former champion.
[1175.40 - 1177.40] P:2018.08 E:0.084160 |  Abigail, thank you very much indeed.
[1177.40 - 1181.10] P:1977.01 E:0.095005 |  Here inside the Allianz Arena, the Paris Saint-Germain supporters
[1181.10 - 1183.50] P:2069.94 E:0.084594 |  have just really started to flood in.
[1183.50 - 1185.40] P:1805.70 E:0.095856 |  I can see a couple of Brazil flags.
[1185.40 - 1187.80] P:1992.94 E:0.097821 |  I mean, Marquinhos isn't the only Brazilian in this squad,
[1187.80 - 1190.20] P:1976.91 E:0.081457 |  but I feel like they may be for him.
[1190.20 - 1192.70] P:1935.41 E:0.067455 |  We'll discuss him, his impact on the team,
[1192.70 - 1195.70] P:1947.17 E:0.086306 |  Uusman Dembele, and his impact as I turn to the right
[1195.70 - 1200.40] P:2037.33 E:0.075044 |  and I just see a sea of blue and black and the yellow shirts
[1200.40 - 1203.70] P:2008.40 E:0.079494 |  that Inter will be playing in in this Champions League final tonight.
[1203.70 - 1207.00] P:1984.59 E:0.084404 |  Lautaro Martinez, he'll be one of the big focuses.
[1207.00 - 1210.90] P:1937.93 E:0.084523 |  The two goalkeepers will hear from Petr Cech on Donorumma at one end
[1210.90 - 1213.20] P:1929.68 E:0.075890 |  and Janssommar at the other.
[1213.20 - 1217.00] P:1973.19 E:0.084882 |  One hour from kickoff, the build-up to the Champions League final continues
[1217.00 - 1218.80] P:1887.39 E:0.068806 |  after the news with Nick Horatio.

[1226.30 - 1229.50] P:1811.87 E:0.070123 |  by a 50% tariff announced by Donald Trump.
[1229.50 - 1232.80] P:1646.88 E:0.082632 |  The doubling in import taxes is due to take effect on Wednesday.
[1232.80 - 1235.20] P:1708.88 E:0.078739 |  Gareth Stath is the head of UK Steel.
[1235.20 - 1238.20] P:1959.20 E:0.052795 |  This further tariff tax hike
[1238.20 - 1242.50] P:1745.66 E:0.072826 |  will deliver a serious body blow to the UK steel sector.
[1242.50 - 1246.40] P:1683.03 E:0.077512 |  We were hoping to see a removal of the tariffs.
[1246.40 - 1251.00] P:1595.27 E:0.076740 |  So to wake up this morning to a doubling of the tariffs to 50%
[1251.00 - 1256.50] P:1685.37 E:0.072588 |  will deliver serious concern and confusion to our sector here in the UK.
[1256.50 - 1259.10] P:1652.36 E:0.098861 |  The body of a girl has been recovered from the River Thames.
[1259.10 - 1262.60] P:1755.09 E:0.089544 |  It was found near Gravesend where two children got into trouble yesterday.
[1262.60 - 1265.40] P:1765.60 E:0.058414 |  The boy is in a stable condition in hospital.
[1265.50 - 1269.80] P:1817.48 E:0.088800 |  Beijing has issued a strong response to a warning by the American Defence Secretary
[1269.80 - 1273.00] P:1693.73 E:0.094009 |  that an attack by China on Taiwan could be imminent.
[1273.00 - 1278.60] P:1765.64 E:0.072684 |  The Chinese embassy in Singapore said the US was the biggest troublemaker in the region.
[1278.60 - 1283.90] P:1844.51 E:0.094832 |  Hamas says it's prepared to return 10 living hostages and the bodies of another 18
[1283.90 - 1287.80] P:1775.21 E:0.078847 |  in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody.
[1287.80 - 1293.40] P:1676.26 E:0.069670 |  But it's repeated certain demands which are not included in the US ceasefire proposal.
[1293.40 - 1298.20] P:1806.19 E:0.093703 |  Campaigners say a ban on the sale of single-use vapes may have a limited effect
[1298.20 - 1299.90] P:1878.94 E:0.070748 |  in protecting the environment.
[1299.90 - 1304.30] P:1707.08 E:0.078963 |  The aim is to cut down on waste and make the products less attractive to children.
[1304.30 - 1308.70] P:1865.01 E:0.065817 |  Marcus Saxton is from the Independent British Vape Trade Association.
[1308.70 - 1313.00] P:1741.64 E:0.096206 |  There's no doubt that there's too many millions upon millions of these products,
[1313.00 - 1315.10] P:1636.37 E:0.086473 |  single-use that have gone into landfills.
[1315.10 - 1318.00] P:1771.69 E:0.088062 |  From environmentally, there is a really good opportunity.
[1318.00 - 1320.00] P:1939.49 E:0.088528 |  So far as youth access, unlikely.
[1320.00 - 1324.60] P:1707.71 E:0.082116 |  It's illegal today, let alone when the ban comes into effect, to sell to a miner.
[1324.60 - 1328.80] P:1811.97 E:0.091463 |  And therefore, it's those rogue traders that aren't following the legal responsibility
[1328.80 - 1329.80] P:1783.94 E:0.079714 |  that are the challenge.
[1329.80 - 1338.80] P:1815.10 E:0.070907 |  And the UK's oldest and smallest private army has its full complement of 20 for the first time since 1890.

[1368.10 - 1371.60] P:1109.23 E:0.122537 |  They want to finish this era with a title.

[1402.20 - 1409.10] P:1907.35 E:0.083913 |  and are waving them back and forth in the hot and close Munich weather this evening.
[1409.10 - 1410.40] P:2076.21 E:0.091161 |  It's going to be some final.
[1410.40 - 1412.50] P:1878.10 E:0.093151 |  Both teams have suffered heartbreak before.
[1412.50 - 1416.50] P:1929.25 E:0.078725 |  Both have walked the hard road to the end game this time.
[1418.00 - 1421.90] P:1604.61 E:0.107607 |  See tears from Neymar, but he didn't do enough tonight for PSG.
[1421.90 - 1424.90] P:1346.90 E:0.103487 |  And Bayern Munich deservedly win the Champions League.
[1424.90 - 1427.50] P:1407.08 E:0.098978 |  Tears of joy from the Manchester City fans.
[1427.50 - 1430.30] P:1401.17 E:0.088318 |  One or two of the tears of desperation from the Inter players.
[1430.80 - 1431.80] P:1686.49 E:0.144995 |  Fabian Ruiz.
[1431.80 - 1433.30] P:1689.04 E:0.118000 |  Oh, he's scored.
[1434.50 - 1438.30] P:1566.07 E:0.127341 |  Fabian Ruiz makes it one more on the night to Paris Saint-Germain.
[1438.30 - 1439.30] P:1399.63 E:0.115837 |  So could fall in.
[1439.30 - 1440.30] P:1624.52 E:0.108675 |  Trav.
[1441.00 - 1444.30] P:1638.05 E:0.117589 |  Wonderful finish to put Inter in front.
[1444.30 - 1445.30] P:1332.47 E:0.091223 |  Cello Noli.
[1445.30 - 1447.70] P:1676.24 E:0.120265 |  The balls in the back of the Arsenal net.
[1447.70 - 1450.70] P:1602.30 E:0.114350 |  The Italian Champions have the lead here.
[1450.70 - 1453.10] P:1539.23 E:0.135931 |  The Torre Montenegro is in two.
[1453.10 - 1458.10] P:1530.00 E:0.114290 |  And even at this very early stage, Monaco simply cannot handle Inter.
[1458.10 - 1461.10] P:1770.24 E:0.117576 |  The team that takes this in right to the back post this Saturday.
[1461.10 - 1466.90] P:1788.44 E:0.106993 |  And Manchester City's player, they've been absolutely bombarded by Paris Saint-Germain.
[1466.90 - 1468.10] P:1364.68 E:0.114139 |  Terremes the layoff.
[1468.10 - 1469.10] P:1464.43 E:0.118207 |  Fratasi.
[1469.10 - 1470.60] P:1409.20 E:0.112028 |  Oh, he's done it.
[1470.60 - 1477.10] P:1469.66 E:0.105638 |  Davide Fratasi puts Inter in front yet again on aggregate into seven.
[1477.10 - 1479.10] P:1477.06 E:0.099269 |  Barcelona six.
[1479.10 - 1480.10] P:1464.29 E:0.123359 |  Hakimi.
[1480.10 - 1483.10] P:1573.70 E:0.118903 |  Leipzig, bottom corner.
[1484.10 - 1488.10] P:1601.86 E:0.122574 |  The right back has clinched it surely for Paris Saint-Germain.
[1488.10 - 1491.10] P:1591.65 E:0.108172 |  That's finished the semi-final.
[1491.10 - 1493.10] P:1469.15 E:0.109950 |  Inter the man.
[1493.10 - 1498.10] P:1428.96 E:0.114667 |  Immune it down for their seventh European Cup final.
[1504.10 - 1508.10] P:2029.64 E:0.090979 |  So it's Inter for the first time in 15 years,
[1508.10 - 1512.10] P:2006.72 E:0.078097 |  or Paris Saint-Germain for the first time.
[1512.10 - 1514.10] P:2099.02 E:0.088229 |  Correspondent John Murray, still with us.
[1514.10 - 1516.10] P:2106.48 E:0.097768 |  Chris Sutton and Danny Murphy have joined us.

[1520.10 - 1522.10] P:1774.21 E:0.075054 |  This is something else, Danny, isn't it?
[1522.10 - 1524.10] P:1852.55 E:0.091136 |  Yeah, it's a pretty special occasion.
[1524.10 - 1530.10] P:1750.38 E:0.083922 |  I was here yesterday we got here and last night it was in Munich and it was Italians everywhere.
[1530.10 - 1533.10] P:1827.09 E:0.092060 |  Inter Milan fans were loud, boys were in good spirits.
[1533.10 - 1535.10] P:1838.29 E:0.073628 |  But it's great to see.
[1535.10 - 1538.10] P:1879.40 E:0.082806 |  It's what you want from European final.
[1538.10 - 1542.10] P:1883.06 E:0.087110 |  Two sets of fans who are just desperate for their team to go over the line.
[1542.10 - 1543.10] P:1903.83 E:0.106477 |  Chris?
[1543.10 - 1545.10] P:1809.95 E:0.100331 |  Yeah, and we're an hour away from kick-off.
[1545.10 - 1549.10] P:1911.67 E:0.100667 |  It's pretty raw because at this moment,
[1549.10 - 1551.10] P:1866.30 E:0.097085 |  what is going to be like in an hour's time?
[1551.10 - 1552.10] P:1853.62 E:0.100511 |  Who knows?
[1552.10 - 1559.10] P:1926.46 E:0.092716 |  It's a fascinating final because we've all got our ideas about how we think it's going to pan out.
[1559.10 - 1564.10] P:1891.01 E:0.075142 |  But with the contrast of the styles with these two teams, you just don't know.
[1564.10 - 1566.10] P:1832.59 E:0.097498 |  People have been asking, haven't they?
[1566.10 - 1568.10] P:1943.40 E:0.093129 |  But it really does feel like 50-50.
[1568.10 - 1573.10] P:1924.29 E:0.084051 |  We're talking about two teams who've got their own style, their own way of playing.
[1573.10 - 1576.10] P:1785.57 E:0.072701 |  PSG with that dynamic from three.
[1576.10 - 1578.10] P:1928.38 E:0.095833 |  Inter Milan, who some have called pragmatic in the past,
[1578.10 - 1582.10] P:2017.77 E:0.091727 |  but they certainly weren't that in the semi-final against Barcelona at times in that game.
[1582.10 - 1584.10] P:1735.01 E:0.081378 |  They went to Pato end-to-end.
[1584.10 - 1587.10] P:1960.63 E:0.102371 |  It was a really, really good game to watch.
[1587.10 - 1589.10] P:1861.78 E:0.072117 |  I'm expecting big things tonight.
[1589.10 - 1592.10] P:1890.51 E:0.093937 |  I don't normally get too excited by big games, but tonight I really am.
[1592.10 - 1595.10] P:1893.80 E:0.093511 |  I think we could have a really special final.
[1595.10 - 1601.10] P:1776.20 E:0.092663 |  So is it because there's no obvious favourite that big?
[1601.10 - 1603.10] P:1869.33 E:0.106153 |  The PSG, by the way, their goalkeepers are just coming out.
[1603.10 - 1609.10] P:1936.36 E:0.104535 |  So we've got our first look at the massive figure of Gigi Donnarumma with his white gloves
[1609.10 - 1614.10] P:1860.21 E:0.097316 |  and his shades of blue training kit waved to the fans.
[1614.10 - 1616.10] P:1836.15 E:0.095955 |  My goodness me, Danny.
[1616.10 - 1619.10] P:1905.28 E:0.088991 |  I know he's big, but he's not big, is he?
[1619.10 - 1620.10] P:1801.51 E:0.090328 |  He's massive.
[1620.10 - 1623.10] P:1794.27 E:0.097962 |  You wouldn't want to take a penalty against him, would you, Chris?
[1623.10 - 1626.10] P:1901.54 E:0.100140 |  I mean, come on, he's actually in the last cup at the Arsenal and Villa game.
[1626.10 - 1629.10] P:1777.56 E:0.085004 |  He had two outstanding games, second leg, didn't he?
[1629.10 - 1632.10] P:1784.72 E:0.099418 |  Made some saves that you don't expect keepers to make,
[1632.10 - 1634.10] P:1710.47 E:0.097651 |  because he's that big and agile.
[1634.10 - 1636.10] P:1632.14 E:0.090966 |  He could play a key role tonight.
[1636.10 - 1639.10] P:1749.40 E:0.096362 |  But it's going to be fascinating because of all the different battles
[1639.10 - 1641.10] P:1699.54 E:0.090537 |  that were all over the pitch.
[1641.10 - 1643.10] P:1766.42 E:0.095467 |  And more importantly, that tactical one,
[1643.10 - 1648.10] P:1862.90 E:0.098242 |  because Milan play in the back three against PSG's front three, of course.
[1648.10 - 1653.10] P:2037.17 E:0.098639 |  Here come Inter, gold shorts, blue shirts, Yan Summer.
[1653.10 - 1655.10] P:2074.41 E:0.106106 |  The other great goalkeeper of this final,
[1655.10 - 1658.10] P:2031.00 E:0.089780 |  we're going to hear a bit closer to kick off from Petr Cech,
[1658.10 - 1663.10] P:1990.04 E:0.091885 |  who I've been speaking to, about the differences between these two keepers.
[1663.10 - 1667.10] P:1939.08 E:0.084740 |  I mean, Summer looks tiny next to Donnarumma,
[1667.10 - 1669.10] P:1981.28 E:0.086601 |  but then so does absolutely everybody else.
[1669.10 - 1675.10] P:1940.96 E:0.088172 |  Chris, the player who got the biggest cheer when we saw the teams walk into the stadium for PSG, though,
[1675.10 - 1681.10] P:1862.53 E:0.083733 |  was Usman Dembele, 33 goals, 13 assists this season.
[1681.10 - 1684.10] P:1887.62 E:0.095382 |  There is a feeling, isn't there, if he were to play well and they were to win,
[1684.10 - 1686.10] P:1913.21 E:0.080294 |  he could be a Ballon d'Or winner.
[1686.10 - 1688.10] P:1940.75 E:0.082219 |  Yeah, there is that feeling.
[1688.10 - 1692.10] P:1959.67 E:0.097826 |  And I mean, it's amazing, really, because over the years,
[1692.10 - 1695.10] P:1704.00 E:0.075661 |  I think I'm, you know, the same as Danny.
[1695.10 - 1697.10] P:1937.77 E:0.096510 |  I never saw him as a centre forward.
[1697.10 - 1701.10] P:1925.72 E:0.090418 |  So to sort of throw him up as Luis Enrique has done,
[1701.10 - 1703.10] P:1835.06 E:0.091389 |  and to have that goals return,
[1703.10 - 1705.10] P:1953.03 E:0.087050 |  33 goals this season, you mentioned.
[1705.10 - 1709.10] P:1914.79 E:0.093200 |  I think his previous best was something like 14 in a season,
[1709.10 - 1710.10] P:2022.81 E:0.105385 |  but he's on fire.
[1710.10 - 1714.10] P:2021.00 E:0.102584 |  He's not a sort of conventional centre forward, as we know it,
[1714.10 - 1716.10] P:1902.61 E:0.096804 |  but I don't think he'll play up against the centre halves.
[1716.10 - 1718.10] P:1884.14 E:0.100957 |  I think he's one who will drift.
[1718.10 - 1720.10] P:1875.14 E:0.085183 |  You know, he'll come short.
[1720.10 - 1725.10] P:1906.51 E:0.096367 |  He plays a bit on instinct, on feeling, and has worked so well for PSG,
[1725.10 - 1727.10] P:1842.77 E:0.087872 |  so, you know, they're not going to change that.
[1727.10 - 1730.10] P:1854.05 E:0.086968 |  The thing that's also incredible about him, Chris, as well,
[1730.10 - 1732.10] P:1929.10 E:0.084621 |  is that he got dropped, but he asked for a game, didn't he,
[1732.10 - 1734.10] P:1701.60 E:0.079391 |  if you remember, away.
[1734.10 - 1736.10] P:1928.73 E:0.098936 |  There was talk of a little fallout, and he gave him a little kick
[1736.10 - 1738.10] P:1767.15 E:0.083948 |  up the backside by leaving him out.
[1738.10 - 1741.10] P:1842.45 E:0.080895 |  He then gives him a free roll in that central, like Chris said,
[1741.10 - 1744.10] P:1715.69 E:0.089142 |  go where you want, you know, do drop in, go where you want to go wide,
[1744.10 - 1747.10] P:1887.53 E:0.076941 |  do whatever you need to do to impact the game.
[1747.10 - 1750.10] P:1991.20 E:0.099226 |  And his goals, Tally, he's like no other season he's ever had before,
[1750.10 - 1753.10] P:1839.96 E:0.074748 |  so, yeah, he's going to be a big player for them,
[1753.10 - 1756.10] P:1737.84 E:0.080966 |  but they've got talent all across that front three, haven't they?
[1756.10 - 1758.10] P:1877.12 E:0.087572 |  Right, let's bring in the most nervous man in Munich,
[1758.10 - 1760.10] P:1892.45 E:0.091597 |  believe it in Julianne Laurent.
[1760.10 - 1762.10] P:1629.51 E:0.091187 |  Hello, guys. Hi, Steve. Hi, everyone.
[1762.10 - 1763.10] P:1958.27 E:0.059391 |  How you doing?
[1763.10 - 1765.10] P:1727.50 E:0.092804 |  I'm so stressed. I haven't eaten all day.
[1765.10 - 1768.10] P:1853.15 E:0.095100 |  I don't think I could eat. I mean, I saw you at lunchtime,
[1768.10 - 1770.10] P:1927.95 E:0.096882 |  and I was stressed already, and now I'm sweating as well
[1770.10 - 1772.10] P:1895.67 E:0.093229 |  at stress because it's so hot.
[1772.10 - 1775.10] P:1927.23 E:0.089061 |  I guess play...
[1775.10 - 1777.10] P:1822.40 E:0.076188 |  Play the occasion, no, was it? Play...
[1777.10 - 1779.10] P:2003.85 E:0.092448 |  Play the game, not the occasion.
[1779.10 - 1781.10] P:1729.03 E:0.098447 |  Yeah, but I'm not good at not playing the occasion.
[1781.10 - 1783.10] P:1922.45 E:0.102633 |  Keep you out of that dressing room, will you?
[1784.10 - 1786.10] P:1832.09 E:0.087608 |  It's a great point, though, right?
[1786.10 - 1789.10] P:1717.39 E:0.079800 |  Because, Chris, we can talk a bit more about Dembele
[1789.10 - 1791.10] P:1709.09 E:0.083392 |  specifically in a second.
[1791.10 - 1794.10] P:1685.22 E:0.078905 |  But PSG play some wonderful stuff, all right?
[1794.10 - 1796.10] P:1642.25 E:0.076786 |  Some great stuff.
[1796.10 - 1799.10] P:1935.72 E:0.088989 |  Finals, big finals often end up being KG.
[1799.10 - 1802.10] P:1804.31 E:0.088106 |  If this ends up being that kind of final,
[1802.10 - 1805.10] P:1929.49 E:0.091017 |  is it more suited to Inter than it is to PSG?
[1805.10 - 1808.10] P:1857.85 E:0.085251 |  Well, that's what makes it fascinating, isn't it?
[1808.10 - 1813.10] P:1972.06 E:0.102233 |  PSG aren't going to change the way that they play,
[1813.10 - 1815.10] P:1970.63 E:0.091772 |  but what's also fascinating is, you know,
[1815.10 - 1817.10] P:1884.56 E:0.099803 |  the contrast in ages, you know, that's been
[1817.10 - 1819.10] P:1790.36 E:0.084600 |  spoken a lot in the build-up to the final.
[1819.10 - 1821.10] P:1875.08 E:0.101445 |  You know, it is a young team. Let's get it right.
[1821.10 - 1823.10] P:1797.11 E:0.093444 |  I think Marquinhos is their oldest player,
[1823.10 - 1827.10] P:1853.09 E:0.103300 |  the only player over 30, I think Fabian Ruiz
[1827.10 - 1829.10] P:1950.76 E:0.090843 |  is just under 30.
[1829.10 - 1832.10] P:1929.55 E:0.091372 |  The rest are all sort of kids in footballing terms,
[1832.10 - 1834.10] P:1885.81 E:0.106452 |  and then you look at the sort of battle-hardened
[1834.10 - 1836.10] P:1919.68 E:0.081975 |  Inter team, Mkhitaryan in there,
[1836.10 - 1839.10] P:1812.19 E:0.099121 |  Chanololu, Chirby at the back,
[1839.10 - 1842.10] P:1864.29 E:0.087507 |  and, you know, they will be KG.
[1842.10 - 1844.10] P:2026.51 E:0.103397 |  They are street-wise, you know, they will try
[1844.10 - 1847.10] P:1788.83 E:0.087501 |  and ruffle a few feathers with PSG,
[1847.10 - 1849.10] P:1898.75 E:0.097063 |  and they will look to frustrate,
[1849.10 - 1850.10] P:1859.50 E:0.086484 |  but I think Danny touched on it.
[1850.10 - 1852.10] P:1778.24 E:0.091456 |  I don't think that this is going to be an Inter team
[1852.10 - 1854.10] P:1944.31 E:0.086117 |  who sits back all game.
[1854.10 - 1857.10] P:1827.18 E:0.084121 |  I think they'll pick their moments when they do press,
[1857.10 - 1859.10] P:1765.78 E:0.089374 |  and when they press, you know, they'll press with bigger
[1859.10 - 1861.10] P:1818.33 E:0.084986 |  and intent.
[1861.10 - 1862.10] P:1778.48 E:0.096345 |  They'll try and win the ball back high up.
[1862.10 - 1864.10] P:1817.92 E:0.085472 |  Danny touched on the Barcelona again.
[1864.10 - 1866.10] P:1737.51 E:0.083495 |  That was an incredible game, and, you know,
[1866.10 - 1869.10] P:1875.28 E:0.094589 |  the early goals for them came from them being brave
[1869.10 - 1871.10] P:1733.97 E:0.090664 |  and pressing, so it's not going to be one where they
[1871.10 - 1874.10] P:1971.87 E:0.091492 |  just sit in and let PSG dictate and eventually
[1874.10 - 1876.10] P:1902.32 E:0.088928 |  find a way of scoring.
[1876.10 - 1878.10] P:1865.56 E:0.089802 |  They'll have a plan, they'll be versatile,
[1878.10 - 1881.10] P:1800.51 E:0.075598 |  they'll be adaptable, and that may be a problem for PSG.
[1881.10 - 1883.10] P:1844.22 E:0.085228 |  I think Chris makes some great points.
[1883.10 - 1886.10] P:1899.69 E:0.073645 |  I mean, the two wing-backs, when they get the opportunity,
[1886.10 - 1889.10] P:1813.23 E:0.078080 |  we've seen them fly forward time and time again,
[1889.10 - 1891.10] P:1827.87 E:0.090631 |  and it's going to be interesting to see if the two
[1891.10 - 1894.10] P:1862.42 E:0.078151 |  wide boys with PSG do the defending,
[1894.10 - 1896.10] P:1823.72 E:0.089463 |  or they let their full-backs take the wing-backs,
[1896.10 - 1898.10] P:1883.18 E:0.083494 |  as they come onto them, because if they do that,
[1898.10 - 1900.10] P:1757.92 E:0.076044 |  we're talking about man-to-man all over the pitch,
[1900.10 - 1903.10] P:1768.94 E:0.090779 |  then we could be in for an epic, we could have goals galore,
[1903.10 - 1906.10] P:1824.14 E:0.073474 |  but I don't want to tempt face, so I'll shut up.
[1908.10 - 1910.10] P:1549.10 E:0.097163 |  I agree with what the boys have just said.
[1910.10 - 1913.10] P:1836.89 E:0.085007 |  I guess what happened two years ago as well with Inter,
[1913.10 - 1916.10] P:1866.77 E:0.086331 |  we were talking before the show with Chris,
[1916.10 - 1918.10] P:1760.15 E:0.097694 |  we were together in Istanbul.
[1919.10 - 1921.10] P:1809.09 E:0.088400 |  If you're Inter, what happened two years ago
[1921.10 - 1924.10] P:1696.59 E:0.092838 |  when you were probably the better team against Manchester City
[1924.10 - 1927.10] P:1641.41 E:0.092660 |  on that day, on that game, and you had a lot of regrets after?
[1927.10 - 1930.10] P:1878.79 E:0.078201 |  Is there an extra motivation to go and win tonight?
[1930.10 - 1934.10] P:1872.04 E:0.088332 |  Or on the other hand, it's like you can't lose again tonight.
[1934.10 - 1936.10] P:1721.92 E:0.086103 |  You can't lose a second final in three seasons,
[1936.10 - 1939.10] P:1866.83 E:0.088403 |  so the pressure is probably even bigger in a way,
[1939.10 - 1941.10] P:1771.32 E:0.097023 |  because you didn't win the one two years ago, in a sense.
[1941.10 - 1944.10] P:1849.26 E:0.092358 |  It's not bigger in a way, PSG haven't won a final,
[1944.10 - 1947.10] P:1781.48 E:0.097826 |  so I understand what you're saying,
[1947.10 - 1950.10] P:1889.55 E:0.094928 |  and people can look at it saying a final, look at the PSG,
[1950.10 - 1953.10] P:1920.49 E:0.096600 |  the age of the team, there's plenty of time for them
[1953.10 - 1956.10] P:1817.66 E:0.083232 |  in years to come to win a final, of course there is.
[1956.10 - 1959.10] P:1834.95 E:0.082421 |  But football doesn't really work like that,
[1959.10 - 1962.10] P:1953.42 E:0.086505 |  especially at this level, the absolute elite level.
[1962.10 - 1965.10] P:1820.14 E:0.097085 |  You don't think there's extra pressure for Inter,
[1965.10 - 1969.10] P:1771.61 E:0.087340 |  because they would lose a second final in three years?
[1969.10 - 1972.10] P:1910.54 E:0.109005 |  Nobody does that, Valencia did that, they never won a game to a final.
[1972.10 - 1976.10] P:1901.33 E:0.100707 |  You can spin it whichever way you want to favour your PSG.
[1977.10 - 1980.10] P:1893.19 E:0.105644 |  However you want to do it, there's pressure on both, there is.
[1980.10 - 1983.10] P:1998.43 E:0.101554 |  The ageing Inter team, is it a last chance for some of their players?
[1983.10 - 1988.10] P:1885.09 E:0.089972 |  Of course it is, there may be a bit of edginess because of that.
[1988.10 - 1993.10] P:1781.93 E:0.083501 |  Nobody knows how this is going to pan out, that's what makes it the most.
[1993.10 - 1998.10] P:1927.71 E:0.077723 |  I do think as well, the failures sometimes create resilience.
[1998.10 - 2001.10] P:1845.17 E:0.075034 |  So this Inter side, they've played in big games,
[2001.10 - 2003.10] P:1853.59 E:0.088654 |  they're not going to be fazed by it,
[2003.10 - 2005.10] P:1943.86 E:0.084469 |  but because you've lost, especially in the city game,
[2005.10 - 2007.10] P:1828.26 E:0.057002 |  where they felt like they did okay,
[2007.10 - 2009.10] P:1706.49 E:0.083062 |  that can actually help them grow,
[2009.10 - 2012.10] P:1794.62 E:0.086357 |  and get over the line, being that little bit more determined.
[2012.10 - 2016.10] P:1779.53 E:0.089855 |  This is right, you just don't know how players are going to react on a big day like this.
[2016.10 - 2018.10] P:1841.02 E:0.067338 |  It's relevant of a little bit of experience tonight.
[2018.10 - 2021.10] P:1875.63 E:0.097673 |  Are PSG duels more of a team now than Bapay's gone?
[2021.10 - 2024.10] P:1852.83 E:0.087870 |  If Bapay was here this evening,
[2024.10 - 2028.10] P:1911.41 E:0.084925 |  would that make a huge difference in the way that they set that out,
[2028.10 - 2030.10] P:1813.28 E:0.087133 |  in the way that they press the ball?
[2030.10 - 2031.10] P:1739.76 E:0.088193 |  What's your view on that?
[2031.10 - 2033.10] P:1733.54 E:0.084655 |  Yeah, because he doesn't press.
[2033.10 - 2036.10] P:1541.65 E:0.077434 |  Would they have got here even with him?
[2036.10 - 2040.10] P:1706.50 E:0.086887 |  They wanted to keep him, he decided to go, we know we talked enough about that.
[2040.10 - 2042.10] P:1827.18 E:0.102432 |  He asked him this earlier and he hated it.
[2042.10 - 2047.10] P:1693.89 E:0.099495 |  No, it's not that, because there's been the only moment we've spoken about in Bapay back home.
[2047.10 - 2050.10] P:1633.55 E:0.083572 |  This week has been, where is he now?
[2050.10 - 2052.10] P:1807.32 E:0.091897 |  Is he watching? Does he want PSG to win?
[2052.10 - 2057.10] P:1756.48 E:0.091319 |  Could he have come here to the stadium because this is still the club that he supported as a kid as well.
[2057.10 - 2060.10] P:1806.11 E:0.099253 |  So he's not here, we're not sure if he's watching,
[2060.10 - 2066.10] P:1836.43 E:0.082915 |  but I think Chris, this team is better without him than they would have been with him,
[2066.10 - 2069.10] P:1684.31 E:0.091161 |  and is there better than what they had when he was there last season.
[2069.10 - 2074.10] P:1785.96 E:0.093489 |  As much as I love Kylian myself, he brings you 45-50 goals a season, this is great.
[2074.10 - 2081.10] P:1741.99 E:0.090620 |  But what Danny just said, this team is good and is here because they're all played together,
[2081.10 - 2083.10] P:1639.84 E:0.078792 |  they're tied together, they defend together.
[2083.10 - 2086.10] P:1848.51 E:0.090223 |  They don't defend at 10, and one doesn't do anything.
[2086.10 - 2090.10] P:1758.78 E:0.090819 |  They don't attack with the ball having to go to a one player all the time,
[2090.10 - 2093.10] P:1811.76 E:0.082146 |  like they used to when he was in this team, it's very different.
[2093.10 - 2098.10] P:1679.76 E:0.085012 |  So, yeah, I think they are better now than they were when he was there, or if he had been here.
[2098.10 - 2102.10] P:1879.49 E:0.093029 |  Can I just ask you a quick question on Do-A, because obviously he's been chosen at a Barco tonight.
[2102.10 - 2106.10] P:1827.15 E:0.086551 |  The games I've seen to be the last, only the semi and the quarters,
[2106.10 - 2112.10] P:1717.74 E:0.091642 |  he seems to do his work okay, but has he got that mindset off the ball?
[2112.10 - 2113.10] P:1842.75 E:0.099035 |  Has he got that?
[2113.10 - 2119.10] P:1734.41 E:0.084344 |  Absolutely, and he's young, and a 19-year-old in a Champions League final doesn't happen often,
[2119.10 - 2124.10] P:1760.34 E:0.095398 |  but he's got the mentality and he knows that defensive work tonight against Di Marco,
[2124.10 - 2128.10] P:1748.14 E:0.092446 |  or against one of the two, something forward for Inter,
[2128.10 - 2133.10] P:1824.18 E:0.088245 |  or one of the Mikitaian, for example, going forward, that's his job, that's for him, and he will do it.
[2133.10 - 2139.10] P:1852.13 E:0.085190 |  So, Danny's asked you one on that side, the other side, Kravatskelya, him coming in in January.
[2139.10 - 2143.10] P:1889.78 E:0.080810 |  What difference has he made? Would PSG be here if he had been there?
[2143.10 - 2147.10] P:1850.10 E:0.087363 |  And they were really good, remember, against Manchester City in that second half,
[2147.10 - 2151.10] P:1762.18 E:0.089899 |  when they turned the game over around, and he was not involved because he had signed,
[2151.10 - 2156.10] P:1891.33 E:0.088293 |  he was not registered for the Champions League, but he's been wonderful in possession,
[2156.10 - 2161.10] P:1895.73 E:0.095124 |  because he's one of those old kind of wingers, right, where you don't know if he's going to go on the outside,
[2161.10 - 2166.10] P:1864.31 E:0.082610 |  on the inside, right foot, left foot, and that makes him special,
[2166.10 - 2171.10] P:1907.30 E:0.095406 |  and then defensively, out of possession, the guy works so hard, he helps Nuno Mendes so much,
[2171.10 - 2176.10] P:1902.02 E:0.080035 |  and he will do it again today on Dumfries, and whoever is on the PSG left-hand side.
[2176.10 - 2180.10] P:1878.96 E:0.084020 |  Just two or three of the individuals there that we're going to focus on before kick-off,
[2180.10 - 2186.10] P:1873.59 E:0.078990 |  because there are potential match winners by the bucket load on both sides this evening.
[2186.10 - 2189.10] P:1837.63 E:0.083626 |  Good question on Kylian and Bapay. Where could he be tonight?
[2189.10 - 2193.10] P:1840.72 E:0.090211 |  Maybe he'd be at Roland Garros, watching a couple of Brits Abigail.
[2193.10 - 2198.10] P:1766.20 E:0.093687 |  Maybe. I mean, there have been plenty of fireworks out here, and not just on the court.
[2198.10 - 2201.10] P:1542.50 E:0.088784 |  Cam Norrie looking the more comfortable man on courts in Montmartre right now.
[2201.10 - 2206.10] P:1645.92 E:0.084601 |  He contests his fourth Roland Garros third round against tournament debutante Jacob Fernley.
[2206.10 - 2210.10] P:1714.16 E:0.084906 |  Second set fight back from Fernley, but it's Norrie, who's precision off the ground is holding up.
[2210.10 - 2215.10] P:1759.43 E:0.074471 |  He's got the two sets to love lead, and one all 30 love in the third set.
[2215.10 - 2220.10] P:1926.94 E:0.082807 |  Right, we promised you a few cult heroes from European football.
[2220.10 - 2226.10] P:1958.79 E:0.082554 |  Here's a great one. J.J. Acotcha, big part of the PSG team in the late 90s,
[2226.10 - 2230.10] P:1718.76 E:0.086858 |  before he just came and lit up the Premier League with Bolton Wanderers,
[2230.10 - 2234.10] P:1709.17 E:0.086738 |  talking about players expressing themselves whenever they play.
[2234.10 - 2238.10] P:1854.13 E:0.085565 |  Well, that was him. So here he is on how this PSG team
[2238.10 - 2242.10] P:1876.60 E:0.086912 |  have moved past the likes of Mbappe and Messi and Neymar to this new team,
[2242.10 - 2246.10] P:1867.87 E:0.086794 |  this new era, especially Uzman Dembele.
[2246.10 - 2250.10] P:1508.17 E:0.088717 |  He was on the shadow of Messi and Mbappe and all that,
[2250.10 - 2256.10] P:1318.73 E:0.070932 |  and sometimes some players need that responsibility, they need that confidence, you know.
[2256.10 - 2259.10] P:1131.80 E:0.092085 |  And I think that's what has been given to him, you know,
[2259.10 - 2263.10] P:1254.99 E:0.082004 |  to make him realise that he's now one of the leaders, you know,
[2263.10 - 2267.10] P:1263.24 E:0.087168 |  and he's taking it in good faith and had a wonderful season,
[2267.10 - 2270.10] P:1212.79 E:0.087141 |  and it would be great to see him crown it tomorrow.
[2270.10 - 2277.10] P:1126.05 E:0.078447 |  Especially after the so-called mega-stars in the team left, you know,
[2277.10 - 2281.10] P:1307.18 E:0.088371 |  they've shown a lot of character, got good team spirit.
[2281.10 - 2286.10] P:1258.56 E:0.086897 |  And of course, we know that if you get it right on the day,
[2286.10 - 2290.10] P:1133.35 E:0.086573 |  you can beat anybody, so they've got a very good chance in the final.
[2290.10 - 2295.10] P:1491.97 E:0.088903 |  When those mega-stars left, did you think they could do this so quickly?
[2295.10 - 2303.10] P:1065.78 E:0.082334 |  Well, no, I mean, to be honest, I was expecting them to take more time to build,
[2303.10 - 2307.10] P:984.67 E:0.088228 |  you know, and that was why I think they brought Luis Enrique,
[2307.10 - 2310.10] P:1112.74 E:0.092167 |  who is used to working with youth or young players, you know,
[2310.10 - 2316.10] P:1047.87 E:0.092956 |  but I mean, the way that the team improved, the pace that they did, you know,
[2316.10 - 2318.10] P:695.89 E:0.119825 |  it's unbelievable.
[2318.10 - 2321.10] P:1446.12 E:0.115771 |  So much pace, so many amazing dribblers.
[2321.10 - 2325.10] P:1645.08 E:0.096415 |  I think you're a Kabaret-Skelly guy, but I don't know, you tell me.
[2325.10 - 2328.10] P:1143.10 E:0.095130 |  It's all about getting the balance right, you know,
[2328.10 - 2333.10] P:1142.43 E:0.096971 |  I think they play very attractive football, they try to keep position,
[2333.10 - 2336.10] P:1203.36 E:0.094008 |  and of course, if you want to be a position team,
[2336.10 - 2339.10] P:1074.40 E:0.087085 |  you have to have players that have got skills, you know,
[2339.10 - 2342.10] P:974.10 E:0.083629 |  so I think that's what they've got in their sport.
[2342.10 - 2344.10] P:1701.03 E:0.104594 |  What do you think about the whole PSG project?
[2344.10 - 2347.10] P:1338.67 E:0.089540 |  Well, I think they're qualifying for the final,
[2347.10 - 2353.10] P:1052.73 E:0.075384 |  it's a testimony to the amount of jobs that have been put into the club, you know,
[2353.10 - 2358.10] P:1304.31 E:0.090412 |  and of course now they've changed the perspective of the club
[2358.10 - 2366.10] P:1124.36 E:0.109143 |  from paying huge amounts of transfer fee to growing their own young players,
[2366.10 - 2369.10] P:1245.23 E:0.078882 |  you know, it is amazing to see how far they've come.
[2369.10 - 2371.10] P:1376.89 E:0.100770 |  Are they more of a team now?
[2371.10 - 2376.10] P:1252.84 E:0.089071 |  Oh, they are, they are, because I think they have players that haven't got ego,
[2376.10 - 2381.10] P:1183.22 E:0.075082 |  you know, players that are playing more for the club than their own personal accolades,
[2381.10 - 2385.10] P:1372.64 E:0.077033 |  so I think, yeah, of course, they are more like a team now.
[2386.10 - 2389.10] P:1884.53 E:0.095447 |  That's JJ Acotcha speaking to me here in Munich,
[2389.10 - 2392.10] P:1924.40 E:0.096235 |  Julianne Laurent, Chris Sutton, correspondent John Murray,
[2392.10 - 2395.10] P:1841.49 E:0.091644 |  and Danny Murphy with us for another minute or so.
[2395.10 - 2398.10] P:1878.65 E:0.080787 |  Danny, we've talked so much about this project,
[2398.10 - 2402.10] P:1873.08 E:0.091017 |  it's so interesting here in Acotcha, and Claude McAlely said it to us yesterday as well.
[2402.10 - 2406.10] P:1918.85 E:0.084577 |  You really get the sense loads of people attached to PSG
[2406.10 - 2411.10] P:1779.54 E:0.084725 |  are really happy they've gone down this road and completely flipped the script on what they used to do.
[2411.10 - 2415.10] P:1759.61 E:0.106903 |  Absolutely, because what they're seeing is a brilliant team that's rounded,
[2415.10 - 2419.10] P:1890.80 E:0.099461 |  it's got creativity and dynamism and pace when they've got the ball,
[2419.10 - 2422.10] P:1903.85 E:0.106163 |  and without it, they all work to win it back, like you expect.
[2422.10 - 2425.10] P:1948.78 E:0.099304 |  It's funny listening to JJ Acotcha, actually,
[2425.10 - 2427.10] P:1946.27 E:0.091157 |  except Tommy's voice makes me feel a bit nervous,
[2427.10 - 2430.10] P:1863.09 E:0.090429 |  because he's done things to me on a pitch that shouldn't be allowed.
[2430.10 - 2434.10] P:1901.26 E:0.087315 |  Honestly, he's absolutely taken me, honestly, to places I never thought
[2434.10 - 2437.10] P:1808.16 E:0.097388 |  when we played against Paul and Acotcha, what a talent he was.
[2437.10 - 2439.10] P:1879.35 E:0.095017 |  That's why I asked him about Clarek Skellier.
[2439.10 - 2442.10] P:1865.52 E:0.090869 |  Oh, he's got more than him in terms of skill and the things he can do.
[2442.10 - 2445.10] P:1827.97 E:0.089994 |  I mean, different type of player, but what a guy.
[2446.10 - 2449.10] P:1926.68 E:0.093749 |  It's what we love though, isn't it, those great dribblers?
[2449.10 - 2453.10] P:1921.93 E:0.086460 |  You look to see great players and bravery and talent on the pitch,
[2453.10 - 2457.10] P:1739.70 E:0.075697 |  matched with a passion to win and do the right thing for your team.
[2457.10 - 2460.10] P:1901.04 E:0.086231 |  You know, talk about Cavalier, spit it out.
[2461.10 - 2463.10] P:1879.69 E:0.069610 |  He's got great work at it.
[2463.10 - 2465.10] P:1814.37 E:0.102603 |  You know, he does the work, doesn't he, up the ball?
[2465.10 - 2467.10] P:1945.83 E:0.070314 |  It's not just the flash bit.
[2467.10 - 2471.10] P:1908.22 E:0.090000 |  Too many times we see the players who've got all the quality going forward
[2471.10 - 2474.10] P:1881.96 E:0.082594 |  and switch off going that way, but this PSG team, for me anyway,
[2474.10 - 2476.10] P:1998.15 E:0.095593 |  personally, I want to see them get over the line.
[2476.10 - 2479.10] P:1989.08 E:0.087771 |  Great to have you with us, Danny. Thank you very much, Topman.
[2479.10 - 2483.10] P:1956.27 E:0.091843 |  That's Danny Murphy. You will be able to watch him later tonight
[2483.10 - 2488.10] P:1985.16 E:0.091455 |  in the first BBC Television Champions League final match of the day.
[2488.10 - 2492.10] P:1958.18 E:0.089442 |  He's a big part of the commentary team, 11 o'clock, BBC One,
[2492.10 - 2494.10] P:1908.21 E:0.085365 |  here inside the Allianz Arena.
[2494.10 - 2496.10] P:1903.75 E:0.098488 |  Well, there were a couple of moments ago
[2496.10 - 2499.10] P:1845.24 E:0.093207 |  because the Paris Saint-Germain players have now emerged in their blue
[2499.10 - 2503.10] P:1857.47 E:0.095236 |  and white and red training tops, blue shorts, blue socks,
[2503.10 - 2506.10] P:1921.39 E:0.084481 |  right in front of the PSG supporters.
[2506.10 - 2511.10] P:1898.42 E:0.088849 |  So many of them wearing pristine white shirts, bouncing up and down.
[2511.10 - 2514.10] P:1880.70 E:0.095533 |  Donorum is still there in the goal, filling the goal.
[2514.10 - 2517.10] P:1992.94 E:0.078317 |  He makes the goal look absolutely tiny.
[2517.10 - 2521.10] P:1817.25 E:0.081541 |  Let's pick up on Kvaret Skelya, I think, then, Jules.
[2521.10 - 2523.10] P:2015.39 E:0.091901 |  There was a change in this PSG team.
[2523.10 - 2525.10] P:1893.59 E:0.097531 |  We keep talking about them like they've been amazing all season.
[2525.10 - 2527.10] P:1711.15 E:0.095290 |  They actually haven't.
[2527.10 - 2530.10] P:1810.93 E:0.092945 |  They started really slowly, especially in the Champions League,
[2530.10 - 2532.10] P:1767.04 E:0.095989 |  like a very stuttering start,
[2532.10 - 2535.10] P:1722.41 E:0.091098 |  where Luis Enrique was still trying to figure out
[2535.10 - 2538.10] P:1750.25 E:0.094007 |  the best way for this team to go forward.
[2538.10 - 2540.10] P:1797.51 E:0.098212 |  As we said, it's a new project.
[2540.10 - 2544.10] P:1851.65 E:0.098281 |  There was no more Kylian Mbappe, no more of Neymar and Verati
[2544.10 - 2548.10] P:1789.12 E:0.087512 |  and all those players, so he had to try to fit the pieces in the jigsaw
[2548.10 - 2551.10] P:1718.93 E:0.099748 |  in the best way possible, and that took a bit of time.
[2551.10 - 2555.10] P:1764.04 E:0.091866 |  The Jules Mandembele repositioning from Rai Winger to force number nine.
[2555.10 - 2557.10] P:1679.33 E:0.093773 |  Dimitri 3, find the right balance.
[2557.10 - 2560.10] P:1478.10 E:0.093532 |  Fabian Riz was not really in the team at the start of the season,
[2560.10 - 2563.10] P:1638.56 E:0.090009 |  then he established himself, Vittinia in front of the back four,
[2563.10 - 2566.10] P:1893.86 E:0.092224 |  that back four as well, behind them.
[2566.10 - 2571.10] P:1830.94 E:0.081702 |  It was just about time to get things right,
[2571.10 - 2575.10] P:1735.72 E:0.093562 |  and he took his time, and he finally got it probably in that game against Manchester City.
[2575.10 - 2577.10] P:1886.80 E:0.098691 |  So, Jules, I was going to ask you that.
[2577.10 - 2581.10] P:1905.28 E:0.098784 |  Was there a moment, was there a game where you just suddenly felt
[2581.10 - 2584.10] P:1849.93 E:0.086385 |  that the switch had been flicked and here we go?
[2584.10 - 2587.10] P:1734.86 E:0.088640 |  Yeah, I think that's 60-second half, really,
[2587.10 - 2590.10] P:1782.70 E:0.088768 |  and I saw Vittinia last week at the media there, and he said exactly,
[2590.10 - 2592.10] P:1780.96 E:0.102649 |  he said like, this is where you all click.
[2592.10 - 2595.10] P:1882.79 E:0.092168 |  They went two-nil down just after the start of that second half,
[2595.10 - 2602.10] P:1832.27 E:0.085943 |  and at that time, if they lose that game, I think they're probably out of the Champions League as a whole.
[2602.10 - 2611.10] P:1860.93 E:0.086876 |  And they turn it around with the most, I don't know, exciting style of football, entertaining.
[2611.10 - 2615.10] P:1885.24 E:0.089137 |  They score four goals in the space of 30 minutes, destroy City in that second half,
[2615.10 - 2618.10] P:1825.54 E:0.089814 |  and after that, they've never looked back since, really.
[2618.10 - 2623.10] P:1877.04 E:0.084066 |  And for me, that night in January, remember, John, you were under the rain,
[2623.10 - 2626.10] P:1663.22 E:0.102009 |  pouring rain all day in Paris, that's the moment where these teams clicked,
[2626.10 - 2628.10] P:1732.83 E:0.081454 |  and that's the reason why they're here.
[2628.10 - 2631.10] P:1872.11 E:0.092173 |  Yes, Matthew Upson got absolutely soaked that night.
[2631.10 - 2635.10] P:1917.14 E:0.086375 |  He had to hang his coat up at the back of the park to France to dry out.
[2635.10 - 2641.10] P:1929.12 E:0.086664 |  But that, Jules, I put that to Lewis Enrique before the Arsenal first leg.
[2641.10 - 2646.10] P:1850.55 E:0.083527 |  I was the same as you. I felt not seeing every PSG game.
[2646.10 - 2649.10] P:1902.64 E:0.072174 |  It just felt that night that it really clicked.
[2649.10 - 2651.10] P:1808.31 E:0.096451 |  A friend of ours that night said to us,
[2651.10 - 2654.10] P:1778.45 E:0.087644 |  that's the best-eating PSG play for 10 years.
[2654.10 - 2656.10] P:1823.52 E:0.099391 |  So I said to Lewis Enrique before the Arsenal match,
[2656.10 - 2660.10] P:1814.22 E:0.074970 |  was that the night that it really clicked this season?
[2660.10 - 2664.10] P:1694.85 E:0.084899 |  And he was adamant that that was not where it happened.
[2664.10 - 2666.10] P:1839.11 E:0.082644 |  And he said the similar sort of thing yesterday,
[2666.10 - 2674.10] P:1903.92 E:0.083393 |  when he was talking about how he knew that this group would get to this point.
[2674.10 - 2679.10] P:1910.95 E:0.084035 |  And so, he started kind of distancing himself from any moment where it clicked.
[2679.10 - 2683.10] P:1898.25 E:0.097040 |  The feeling was that it was always moving to this point.
[2683.10 - 2687.10] P:1967.90 E:0.085101 |  Which is understood, there's something really good that Mark Inouye said last week as well.
[2687.10 - 2693.10] P:1908.92 E:0.090419 |  He said, this new project, and this is very much one of what we can call the Lewis Enrique project, right?
[2693.10 - 2698.10] P:1907.27 E:0.081094 |  And the objective was not really to be in the final this year.
[2698.10 - 2700.10] P:1717.55 E:0.102709 |  They thought this would be a bit early, but they're here now,
[2700.10 - 2703.10] P:1595.82 E:0.085430 |  and they're going to try to obviously go all the way now.
[2703.10 - 2706.10] P:1849.50 E:0.093546 |  But he said that Lewis Enrique had so many things to fix,
[2706.10 - 2710.10] P:1812.15 E:0.092811 |  that he went like compartment by compartment.
[2710.10 - 2712.10] P:1939.48 E:0.085376 |  So first, build the face.
[2712.10 - 2716.10] P:1921.61 E:0.100788 |  How you get that ball out from your goalkeeper to your winger,
[2716.10 - 2718.10] P:1805.26 E:0.108048 |  to your centre forward.
[2718.10 - 2722.10] P:1701.19 E:0.098516 |  Then, that midfield three, that fluidity, within the structure.
[2722.10 - 2726.10] P:1696.32 E:0.099521 |  So you can have Vittigna as a holding midfield first,
[2726.10 - 2728.10] P:1415.45 E:0.100868 |  and Neves on his right, Ruiz on his left.
[2728.10 - 2731.10] P:1628.88 E:0.102350 |  But during the game, it could be Ruiz who's the holding,
[2731.10 - 2733.10] P:1763.58 E:0.103601 |  Neves on the left, Vittigna on the right.
[2733.10 - 2736.10] P:1769.29 E:0.087206 |  As long as the structure of them three is always right.
[2736.10 - 2740.10] P:1742.73 E:0.087738 |  And then, the two wild players, how to get the ball as quick to them.
[2740.10 - 2742.10] P:1689.38 E:0.088142 |  Then the pressing, then the counter-pressing.
[2742.10 - 2747.10] P:1733.04 E:0.094919 |  And when finally, all those compartments have been worked on and coached and taught,
[2747.10 - 2749.10] P:1762.87 E:0.089036 |  then he said they were ready.
[2749.10 - 2753.10] P:1766.00 E:0.099724 |  Whether that's against City or a bit later, against Stuttgart,
[2753.10 - 2755.10] P:1647.68 E:0.097405 |  or against Liverpool, I don't know.
[2755.10 - 2758.10] P:1789.43 E:0.093157 |  Maybe they're not there yet,
[2758.10 - 2761.10] P:1490.67 E:0.106556 |  but I find it really interesting that they worked on all those departments
[2761.10 - 2764.10] P:1579.89 E:0.088229 |  of their game through those first six months of the season.
[2764.10 - 2767.10] P:1777.85 E:0.101507 |  I think what we've got here with PSG is a real object lesson
[2767.10 - 2770.10] P:1664.49 E:0.071882 |  in how to assemble a team.
[2770.10 - 2773.10] P:1754.93 E:0.095339 |  And all parts seem to work together.
[2773.10 - 2778.10] P:1850.02 E:0.082754 |  St. Chris earlier this afternoon, having seen those matches against the English clubs.
[2778.10 - 2781.10] P:1817.17 E:0.098498 |  In every area of the field, there's someone who contributed to that.
[2781.10 - 2783.10] P:1805.28 E:0.098815 |  Important moments in those wins.
[2783.10 - 2786.10] P:1898.14 E:0.084069 |  So you've got the assembling of the team,
[2786.10 - 2789.10] P:1919.46 E:0.104028 |  and you've also got the way that they're coached.
[2789.10 - 2791.10] P:1896.48 E:0.097876 |  And I think that's where they are, where they are.
[2791.10 - 2796.10] P:1939.92 E:0.106481 |  So you've got all that talent, and Jules talks about that Manchester City game.
[2796.10 - 2800.10] P:1871.21 E:0.107773 |  But then to dispatch the three English teams, as they did do,
[2800.10 - 2804.10] P:1846.31 E:0.105669 |  to actually go to Anfield when they dominated the game in Paris,
[2804.10 - 2806.10] P:1804.29 E:0.098514 |  and ended up losing 1-0,
[2806.10 - 2810.10] P:1935.93 E:0.100386 |  but to have that resilience, that toughness to go to Anfield
[2810.10 - 2813.10] P:1944.41 E:0.095495 |  and then against Aston Villa and then Arsenal.
[2813.10 - 2816.10] P:1982.39 E:0.109125 |  And that's a weather a bit of a storm earlier on against Arsenal.
[2816.10 - 2819.10] P:1883.10 E:0.106737 |  Donnarumma making a couple of brilliant saves.
[2819.10 - 2823.10] P:1913.40 E:0.109751 |  And we're trying to look for things tonight about what are the weaknesses with PSG.
[2823.10 - 2825.10] P:1984.65 E:0.082920 |  Is it mental toughness?
[2825.10 - 2829.10] P:1897.03 E:0.093164 |  Well, nothing from this competition this season have told us that they're mentally weak.
[2829.10 - 2831.10] P:1824.81 E:0.102773 |  No, I don't think it's mental.
[2831.10 - 2835.10] P:1682.11 E:0.091996 |  One thing, if we analyse those games a bit better or deeper,
[2835.10 - 2839.10] P:1645.12 E:0.092281 |  against Aston Villa in the second half of that second leg at Villapart,
[2839.10 - 2844.10] P:1487.88 E:0.101034 |  when Villa were 2-0 down, 3-5-1 down on aggregate, and had nothing to lose anymore,
[2844.10 - 2847.10] P:1605.45 E:0.089909 |  they went after them. They were so aggressive, Villa.
[2847.10 - 2850.10] P:1844.34 E:0.099554 |  That midfield for Villapart worked so hard,
[2850.10 - 2853.10] P:1899.70 E:0.096292 |  and they put Vittigna under pressure, they put PSG under pressure,
[2853.10 - 2855.10] P:1854.39 E:0.074929 |  and they rattled them.
[2855.10 - 2858.10] P:1789.85 E:0.090664 |  Same with Arsenal in the first 20 minutes of the semi-final,
[2858.10 - 2862.10] P:1752.99 E:0.101372 |  second leg at the Par-de-Prince, where PSG could not get out of their own box,
[2862.10 - 2866.10] P:1701.88 E:0.096397 |  could not get the patterns of play, because Arsenal were so aggressive,
[2866.10 - 2869.10] P:1674.44 E:0.094179 |  so into their faces, and that's when they got rattled again.
[2869.10 - 2871.10] P:1826.96 E:0.093578 |  Can they do that tonight?
[2871.10 - 2873.10] P:1456.54 E:0.099584 |  Maybe, but for how long?
[2873.10 - 2876.10] P:1547.62 E:0.105438 |  As we said, Inter don't have the legs to be able to chase after Vittigna,
[2876.10 - 2879.10] P:1693.31 E:0.093910 |  chase after the ball, chase after Neves, after Dembele,
[2879.10 - 2881.10] P:1714.64 E:0.105946 |  after Braz, Kelly or after Dua.
[2881.10 - 2883.10] P:1533.24 E:0.098844 |  So they will have to do it in a different way,
[2883.10 - 2887.10] P:1837.06 E:0.093307 |  but this PSG team can get rattled if you are more aggressive than they are with the ball.
[2887.10 - 2890.10] P:1991.82 E:0.083823 |  I've suddenly got as nervous as you are, Jules,
[2890.10 - 2895.10] P:1909.60 E:0.084661 |  and the reason for that, I've just seen Tom Cruise is in the stadium,
[2895.10 - 2900.10] P:1833.78 E:0.094135 |  and if Tom Cruise is in the stadium, there's a danger there'll be some sort of stunt, isn't there?
[2900.10 - 2904.10] P:1864.32 E:0.102806 |  I don't think tonight is about stunts for him.
[2904.10 - 2908.10] P:1857.41 E:0.106772 |  I think if Tom Cruise is in the stadium, it means he's got to film out.
[2908.10 - 2912.10] P:1963.87 E:0.093248 |  I think he's always got to film out, hasn't he, Tom Cruise?
[2912.10 - 2914.10] P:1954.56 E:0.107440 |  Right, what have we got? Just over half an hour to kick off,
[2914.10 - 2919.10] P:1875.07 E:0.093905 |  let's flip it over to Inter, Simone Linsarchi in his press conference.
[2919.10 - 2922.10] P:1899.29 E:0.099467 |  This squad has given me a great deal. We've won a great deal.
[2922.10 - 2926.10] P:1856.91 E:0.086866 |  I think we've given everything, the players, the staff, the fans,
[2926.10 - 2931.10] P:1781.39 E:0.096045 |  we are proud to represent Inter. It's a competition I dreamt of playing in as a kid.
[2931.10 - 2934.10] P:1687.38 E:0.093263 |  I didn't make it. I only... I didn't make it.
[2934.10 - 2938.10] P:1869.54 E:0.101439 |  I only got as far as the quarter-finals at the Champions League.
[2938.10 - 2942.10] P:1822.59 E:0.090762 |  But thanks to this group of players, I'll be involved in two Champions League finals
[2942.10 - 2947.10] P:1786.81 E:0.097031 |  as a head coach. Another one of our EuroLeague team has dropped in
[2947.10 - 2950.10] P:1707.87 E:0.099453 |  with perfect timing. James Horncastle, good evening.
[2950.10 - 2953.10] P:1707.93 E:0.108074 |  Frosty, do you know who I just walk past coming to this position?
[2953.10 - 2956.10] P:1831.85 E:0.089918 |  Tom Cruise. No. Oh.
[2956.10 - 2960.10] P:1747.97 E:0.110708 |  It was Simone Linsarchi's brother, Pippo, who obviously did win this as a player
[2960.10 - 2963.10] P:1805.31 E:0.095229 |  and was the man of the big occasion.
[2963.10 - 2967.10] P:1772.95 E:0.102269 |  Scored in Champions League finals for Inter's rivals, AC Milan.
[2967.10 - 2973.10] P:1677.60 E:0.100597 |  And yeah, you can only imagine what it's like in the Insarchi household at the moment.
[2973.10 - 2976.10] P:1768.60 E:0.099971 |  That is incredibly modest for him to say,
[2976.10 - 2980.10] P:1832.67 E:0.100423 |  I didn't really make it. I only got as far as the Champions League quarter-final.
[2980.10 - 2984.10] P:1749.88 E:0.102813 |  Does he wear his playing career? Which was a great playing career,
[2984.10 - 2988.10] P:1743.53 E:0.090044 |  just because it wasn't his brother's. Does he wear it lightly?
[2988.10 - 2993.10] P:1870.01 E:0.099926 |  His brother really eclipsed him. I mean, Pippo was the man of the big occasion,
[2993.10 - 2998.10] P:1917.05 E:0.095885 |  as I just said, and was part of an AC Milan side that made history.
[2998.10 - 3003.10] P:1909.71 E:0.101756 |  Remember, reached three finals between 2003, 2005, 2007,
[3003.10 - 3010.10] P:2057.81 E:0.112118 |  and was party of such big moments that Simone winning the lead with Lazio
[3010.10 - 3014.10] P:2046.84 E:0.112304 |  for the first time since the 70s, it didn't really make a ripple,
[3014.10 - 3018.10] P:2050.92 E:0.114886 |  in part because a lot of the Lazio players that were his teammates
[3018.10 - 3022.10] P:2071.47 E:0.113344 |  were bigger names than him. You know, they're like, so, you know,
[3022.10 - 3025.10] P:2086.59 E:0.104769 |  Veron, Stankovic, Crespo, all of those guys,
[3025.10 - 3028.10] P:2084.03 E:0.099377 |  Simone and Zaghi kind of faded into the background.
[3028.10 - 3030.10] P:2065.69 E:0.102559 |  As a coach, that's completely different.
[3030.10 - 3036.10] P:1880.72 E:0.103314 |  His brother's been very successful as a guy who gets teams up from the second division in Serie A.
[3036.10 - 3038.10] P:1729.32 E:0.090698 |  He's done that with three different teams.
[3038.10 - 3043.10] P:1796.99 E:0.088308 |  But Simone is very much the coaching talent in our family.
[3043.10 - 3048.10] P:1805.79 E:0.096193 |  What do you think he has learned from losing to Manchester City in the final
[3048.10 - 3052.10] P:1875.42 E:0.084493 |  a couple of years ago? Does he feel ready to win now?
[3052.10 - 3055.10] P:1753.03 E:0.083267 |  I think they felt ready to win last year as well.
[3055.10 - 3058.10] P:1864.41 E:0.097514 |  I think they played better football last year. They ran away with the league.
[3058.10 - 3062.10] P:1892.66 E:0.088837 |  They ran away with the league in part because they came back from losing that final
[3062.10 - 3066.10] P:1779.06 E:0.083587 |  against Man City, Istanbul, saying, hang on a minute, this mythical team
[3066.10 - 3070.10] P:1913.23 E:0.091213 |  that has made English football history or matched what Man United did in winning a treble,
[3070.10 - 3072.10] P:1896.93 E:0.081372 |  we almost beat them. We could have taken them to extra time.
[3072.10 - 3077.10] P:1895.84 E:0.086956 |  We played better than them for an hour and they wiped the floor of everyone in the league last year
[3077.10 - 3081.10] P:1950.88 E:0.102861 |  and should, should have knocked out at Let's Go.
[3081.10 - 3085.10] P:2045.56 E:0.109752 |  No one this year can begrudge into their place in the final
[3085.10 - 3089.10] P:2012.36 E:0.113779 |  because two years ago people said they had the easy side of the draw.
[3089.10 - 3093.10] P:1963.89 E:0.112725 |  They played Porto, they played Benfica, they played AC Milan in the semi-final.
[3093.10 - 3098.10] P:1926.71 E:0.104578 |  This time around, they've beaten all of the teams that you have to beat.
[3098.10 - 3104.10] P:1908.14 E:0.109317 |  Barcelona, Bayern Munich, they want to beat PSG tonight. I think they will.
[3104.10 - 3112.10] P:1895.36 E:0.103876 |  That is the noise when the stadium announcer read out the name of Lautaro Martinez
[3112.10 - 3120.10] P:1844.77 E:0.100575 |  and you may have just heard Acerbi screamed by the Inter fans away to our right-hand side
[3120.10 - 3125.10] P:1900.74 E:0.099893 |  and he is simply a player, Francesco Acerbi, that we must talk about.
[3125.10 - 3133.10] P:1884.81 E:0.103490 |  He was the face of the win over Barcelona because he somehow, some way, got up to score at the end.
[3133.10 - 3139.10] P:1948.54 E:0.098892 |  His first ever goal in UEFA Club competition. James, that's 1% of his story.
[3139.10 - 3146.10] P:1850.44 E:0.096935 |  It really is. I mean, just that 1%. I mean, in that 93rd minute of that game,
[3146.10 - 3150.10] P:1868.34 E:0.101315 |  he looks to Matteo Damian in his own penalty area and he just says,
[3150.10 - 3154.10] P:1957.58 E:0.096147 |  I'm off, I'm going and ran all the way to the other penalty area
[3154.10 - 3157.10] P:2023.43 E:0.090552 |  and obviously scored the goal that took the game to extra time.
[3157.10 - 3163.10] P:1955.03 E:0.095468 |  Acerbi was signed by AC Milan, so Inter's rivals, to replace Alessandro Nesta.
[3163.10 - 3167.10] P:1958.65 E:0.088172 |  Nesta, one of the greatest centre-backs in Italian football history.
[3167.10 - 3172.10] P:1905.38 E:0.102054 |  It was too much too soon for him. He said he used to go out partying, used to go out drinking.
[3172.10 - 3178.10] P:1746.10 E:0.096844 |  AC Milan got rid of him. He then, test positive for Testosterone, but it's not doping.
[3178.10 - 3183.10] P:1812.45 E:0.093110 |  He's got testicular cancer. He comes through testicular cancer twice
[3183.10 - 3188.10] P:1969.68 E:0.097789 |  and he's been a big part of Inter not only this year, but over the last four years.
[3188.10 - 3192.10] P:1982.89 E:0.075763 |  He loved, he loves playing against the best strikers in the world.
[3192.10 - 3196.10] P:1730.57 E:0.088550 |  We saw that with Erling Haaland, remember, against, right, in Istanbul,
[3196.10 - 3201.10] P:1820.65 E:0.088391 |  but also earlier this season in the league phase where they went to the Etihad and they got a clean sheet.
[3201.10 - 3205.10] P:1887.17 E:0.076277 |  Yeah, this, Acerbi, he's, I remember him saying,
[3205.10 - 3210.10] P:1733.13 E:0.084009 |  there's nothing that can scare him on a football pitch after everything that he's gone through.
[3210.10 - 3214.10] P:1832.65 E:0.091225 |  What about profile of centre forwards?
[3214.10 - 3219.10] P:1880.54 E:0.086051 |  Because I can imagine him sort of sadistically relishing coming up against Erling Haaland.
[3219.10 - 3223.10] P:1811.03 E:0.076146 |  Yeah. Where does then-Belle fit into that? It's totally different profile.
[3223.10 - 3229.10] P:1848.69 E:0.084584 |  It's very tricky, I think. One of the things I would like to maybe bring Jules in on is, like,
[3230.10 - 3234.10] P:1891.74 E:0.091791 |  the similarities between Barcelona's attack and PSG's attack
[3234.10 - 3238.10] P:1803.39 E:0.088475 |  in terms of you have these live wire, unpredictable driblers
[3238.10 - 3241.10] P:1904.59 E:0.085806 |  who will take you in places you don't want to go.
[3241.10 - 3243.10] P:1821.71 E:0.086962 |  With a centre forward, you usually have a reference point.
[3243.10 - 3247.10] P:1771.71 E:0.082959 |  They'll play up against you with these guys, not so much.
[3247.10 - 3250.10] P:1679.44 E:0.087812 |  And I think that's the tricky thing that he has to confront tonight.
[3250.10 - 3253.10] P:1791.65 E:0.108383 |  Yeah, and that's part of the key. If you remember the goal that PSG scored at,
[3253.10 - 3257.10] P:1830.01 E:0.085103 |  where Liverpool, when Ben Bely dropped between Konati and Vondijk
[3257.10 - 3259.10] P:1731.10 E:0.095134 |  and neither of them went with him, he turned.
[3259.10 - 3262.10] P:1788.94 E:0.089309 |  The ball went to Barcola, Barcola crossed and then Ben Bely scored.
[3262.10 - 3266.10] P:1803.53 E:0.091788 |  If you think about the goal that Ben Bely scored at Arsenal at the Emirates
[3266.10 - 3269.10] P:1835.19 E:0.086051 |  in the semifinal first leg, he dropped into that midfield,
[3269.10 - 3272.10] P:1749.15 E:0.083449 |  found a little bit of space, turned, the ball went left,
[3272.10 - 3275.10] P:1820.35 E:0.086388 |  came back to him, cross Kelly, crossed the ball, then Bely scored.
[3275.10 - 3280.10] P:1818.64 E:0.084180 |  Won it again. And I think this is the problem, one of the centre-backs,
[3280.10 - 3284.10] P:1794.88 E:0.093216 |  whether that's a Ciebi, Pavel, probably Bastoni, more likely Bastoni,
[3284.10 - 3288.10] P:1876.62 E:0.087368 |  would have to drop with Ben Bely, otherwise he would find,
[3288.10 - 3291.10] P:1923.06 E:0.101393 |  or he would have to be Mikitaien, whoever, but you cannot give
[3291.10 - 3296.10] P:1909.80 E:0.089428 |  with Ben Bely that time to control the ball, turn, and then you're in trouble.
[3296.10 - 3299.10] P:2015.99 E:0.079198 |  Just watching the players now finish their warm-up,
[3299.10 - 3301.10] P:1915.68 E:0.081058 |  that was the cheer in the background.
[3301.10 - 3305.10] P:1931.88 E:0.090992 |  Janssommar has just jogged down the tunnel in front of us, away to the left.
[3305.10 - 3310.10] P:1980.71 E:0.081695 |  They are just waving some of the PSG substitutes at their fans,
[3310.10 - 3312.10] P:1944.80 E:0.100158 |  who are directly in front of us, opposite us.
[3312.10 - 3315.10] P:2069.25 E:0.087412 |  I mean, I was going to, you can't say a mainstand,
[3315.10 - 3320.10] P:1942.64 E:0.092045 |  because the Allianz is this unbelievable, like elliptical shape.
[3320.10 - 3323.10] P:2001.50 E:0.087699 |  From the outside, it sort of looks like a giant marshmallow,
[3323.10 - 3327.10] P:1847.30 E:0.087833 |  like a blimp has landed on the outskirts of Munich
[3327.10 - 3329.10] P:1791.29 E:0.082895 |  and just decided to stick around.
[3329.10 - 3332.10] P:1916.91 E:0.095025 |  Inside, it's lit up, there's red and white lights all around us.
[3332.10 - 3336.10] P:1954.56 E:0.084186 |  There's a big five Beckenbauer shirt as well,
[3336.10 - 3341.10] P:1835.34 E:0.084552 |  which is just imprinted above us on the roof of the Allianz Arena.
[3341.10 - 3343.10] P:1919.35 E:0.085584 |  Real picture, this stadium.
[3343.10 - 3345.10] P:1830.42 E:0.086971 |  Let's keep going with Inter guys.
[3345.10 - 3349.10] P:1817.64 E:0.075152 |  Chris, we talked about Achirbi and Bastoni.
[3349.10 - 3351.10] P:1866.26 E:0.086205 |  Pavar is a big deal as well, isn't he?
[3351.10 - 3353.10] P:1856.55 E:0.074404 |  He was the question mark.
[3353.10 - 3355.10] P:1944.43 E:0.111687 |  Yes, he was the question mark,
[3355.10 - 3361.10] P:1856.14 E:0.085616 |  but I think it would have been too big a risk if Simone and Zargi,
[3361.10 - 3363.10] P:1767.98 E:0.072712 |  if he didn't feel he was 100% fit.
[3363.10 - 3366.10] P:1884.57 E:0.094797 |  I mean, there's competition in that backline,
[3366.10 - 3370.10] P:1853.41 E:0.096907 |  so it's one of those, if he's 100%, he has to have that trust in him.
[3370.10 - 3373.10] P:1852.79 E:0.096197 |  I think it's as simple as that, but as I say, you look through,
[3373.10 - 3376.10] P:1948.07 E:0.091807 |  you look into squad, they do have strength in depth.
[3376.10 - 3379.10] P:1924.38 E:0.088061 |  He does have that ability to make changes,
[3379.10 - 3380.10] P:1792.57 E:0.096403 |  but he must be confident.
[3380.10 - 3382.10] P:1904.07 E:0.084472 |  I think his last game looking up,
[3382.10 - 3384.10] P:1836.26 E:0.085544 |  John may help me, because I often get things wrong.
[3384.10 - 3386.10] P:1849.08 E:0.079524 |  Was that a month ago?
[3386.10 - 3387.10] P:1814.98 E:0.101880 |  Mr. Last Six.
[3387.10 - 3388.10] P:1745.30 E:0.083900 |  Yes, there you go.
[3388.10 - 3391.10] P:1912.52 E:0.091194 |  It's a fair while ago, so there must be that element of trust,
[3391.10 - 3395.10] P:1894.84 E:0.081216 |  but also his importance to that back three then, James.
[3395.10 - 3396.10] P:1836.26 E:0.087815 |  It's pretty interesting, Chris,
[3396.10 - 3401.10] P:1745.33 E:0.082740 |  watching how Simone and Zargi has managed this team after the semifinals,
[3401.10 - 3405.10] P:1735.05 E:0.081320 |  because they were in a title race, which went down until the final day,
[3405.10 - 3409.10] P:1840.23 E:0.076737 |  but if you looked at the team selections that Zargi was putting out
[3409.10 - 3411.10] P:1791.72 E:0.080917 |  for the last three weeks of the season,
[3411.10 - 3414.10] P:1797.43 E:0.082406 |  I wouldn't say he had his mind on this game,
[3414.10 - 3416.10] P:1784.12 E:0.092864 |  but he was resting, rotating.
[3416.10 - 3421.10] P:1841.01 E:0.077730 |  He was trying to do his best to make sure that Pava could recover
[3421.10 - 3422.10] P:1895.47 E:0.069986 |  and be at his best for this game.
[3422.10 - 3424.10] P:1849.81 E:0.064153 |  It's the same with Lautaro Martinez.
[3424.10 - 3426.10] P:1792.95 E:0.079983 |  Lautaro has been missing.
[3426.10 - 3429.10] P:1904.31 E:0.083740 |  He could have played last Friday against Como.
[3429.10 - 3430.10] P:1904.31 E:0.083763 |  Inzaghi preferred not to.
[3430.10 - 3432.10] P:1952.50 E:0.071769 |  This is your game. This is your night.
[3432.10 - 3435.10] P:1726.12 E:0.098319 |  Has that cranked up the pressure on Inzaghi?
[3435.10 - 3439.10] P:1921.31 E:0.075163 |  It cranked up the pressure, but the fact he made changes,
[3439.10 - 3441.10] P:1837.11 E:0.098653 |  they ended up losing out in that title race.
[3441.10 - 3445.10] P:1937.17 E:0.090955 |  What was said back in Italy about those changes?
[3445.10 - 3446.10] P:1838.14 E:0.083390 |  Was there anger about that?
[3446.10 - 3450.10] P:1878.28 E:0.091704 |  Or is it fair enough if he wins tonight, the justification is in that?
[3450.10 - 3451.10] P:1826.59 E:0.098307 |  Absolutely.
[3451.10 - 3456.10] P:1797.58 E:0.089047 |  The commentary in Italy, let's say the five lives of Italy,
[3456.10 - 3458.10] P:1781.38 E:0.073309 |  were very critical of Simone and Zargi
[3458.10 - 3460.10] P:1884.40 E:0.087200 |  for essentially blowing the title race,
[3460.10 - 3462.10] P:1867.84 E:0.099092 |  which I felt was harsh.
[3462.10 - 3464.10] P:1876.42 E:0.079995 |  We'd never have been that harsh, guys.
[3464.10 - 3469.10] P:1926.31 E:0.084129 |  Because Inter have tried to win every competition that they've entered this season.
[3469.10 - 3472.10] P:1881.31 E:0.094101 |  Napoli had only one competition to focus on.
[3472.10 - 3474.10] P:1899.73 E:0.094924 |  They got out of the Coppa Italia as quickly as they could,
[3474.10 - 3476.10] P:1922.24 E:0.091774 |  and they weren't in Europe.
[3476.10 - 3485.10] P:1850.67 E:0.091182 |  And so, in some respects, Napoli still won the title with the lowest points total since 2011.
[3485.10 - 3490.10] P:1840.11 E:0.096255 |  And the sense is that it's because Inter blew it, not because Napoli won it.
[3490.10 - 3494.10] P:1825.81 E:0.098742 |  Antonio Conte, if he was here, he would give me the hair dryer treatment,
[3494.10 - 3496.10] P:1774.08 E:0.110979 |  if I said that.
[3496.10 - 3498.10] P:1805.75 E:0.103473 |  But that's certainly been the sense in Italy,
[3498.10 - 3502.10] P:1756.19 E:0.102940 |  that the match winners for Napoli were not only Scott MacTomone,
[3502.10 - 3505.10] P:1811.17 E:0.099073 |  but the guys who scored the goals against Inter,
[3505.10 - 3508.10] P:1774.08 E:0.104351 |  Orsalini, Pedro, for Platte and Bologna.
[3508.10 - 3510.10] P:1697.49 E:0.105133 |  And so that's where the criticism is fine.
[3510.10 - 3515.10] P:1553.71 E:0.104853 |  So the big question, James, is what happens to in Zargi?
[3515.10 - 3519.10] P:1722.42 E:0.104900 |  Because when he sat down in front of us in the stadium yesterday, he said, didn't he,
[3519.10 - 3523.10] P:1840.46 E:0.090486 |  since the question's been asked, I will address it.
[3523.10 - 3527.10] P:1839.01 E:0.097958 |  And he is sitting down and having a conversation with the president later this week.
[3527.10 - 3531.10] P:1932.57 E:0.098465 |  So is he off or does tonight,
[3531.10 - 3535.10] P:1845.42 E:0.103800 |  is it absolutely pivotal what happens tonight in terms of what happens to him next?
[3535.10 - 3540.10] P:1896.16 E:0.097770 |  And also, is this genuine and legitimate this interest from Saudi Arabia?
[3540.10 - 3542.10] P:1736.18 E:0.103862 |  Yes, there is an offer from Saudi Arabia,
[3542.10 - 3545.10] P:1722.92 E:0.095555 |  and it would make him the highest paid coach in the world.
[3545.10 - 3549.10] P:1779.02 E:0.107819 |  So, but I think at Simone in Zargi's age,
[3549.10 - 3552.10] P:1704.20 E:0.112197 |  I don't think Saudi Arabia is right for him.
[3552.10 - 3555.10] P:1643.78 E:0.097005 |  I think he appreciates that. I think he would,
[3555.10 - 3558.10] P:1628.51 E:0.098045 |  as he was saying yesterday,
[3558.10 - 3561.10] P:1767.54 E:0.099045 |  he's got such a connection with this group of players at Inter,
[3561.10 - 3564.10] P:1899.46 E:0.095411 |  that he would find it very hard to walk away,
[3564.10 - 3566.10] P:1956.41 E:0.093645 |  even if they achieved fulfilment tonight,
[3566.10 - 3569.10] P:1905.35 E:0.100591 |  in winning the only trophy that they haven't won.
[3569.10 - 3571.10] P:1796.21 E:0.115746 |  Let's take you back to Roland Garros.
[3571.10 - 3573.10] P:1799.74 E:0.101550 |  Have we got a conclusion, Abigail?
[3573.10 - 3576.10] P:1722.81 E:0.095837 |  Just as you come to me, unfortunately,
[3576.10 - 3580.10] P:1694.52 E:0.102490 |  ends on a double fault, an overwhelming moment for Jacob Fernley,
[3580.10 - 3585.10] P:1671.63 E:0.097138 |  and it's Cameron Norrie on his fourth attempt in the third round here at Roland Garros,
[3585.10 - 3588.10] P:1298.72 E:0.099226 |  who comes through, there's a warm embrace at the net.
[3588.10 - 3592.10] P:1340.66 E:0.101921 |  These two Brits both went the college tennis route at Texas Christian University,
[3592.10 - 3595.10] P:1406.39 E:0.105977 |  and Fernley, who only graduated a year ago,
[3595.10 - 3598.10] P:1568.48 E:0.083340 |  and has gone from outside top 500 to edge of top 50.
[3598.10 - 3600.10] P:1514.08 E:0.112822 |  He looked a little over-awed at times,
[3600.10 - 3603.10] P:1847.12 E:0.087848 |  with the chaos of the occasion in the French capital.
[3603.10 - 3605.10] P:1700.42 E:0.092095 |  Excitement about the football.
[3605.10 - 3607.10] P:1860.83 E:0.087865 |  Norrie, steady on the court,
[3607.10 - 3610.10] P:1675.36 E:0.098671 |  found all the marks to create a human wall.
[3610.10 - 3613.10] P:1799.28 E:0.078939 |  It is straight sets for Norrie, 6-3, 7-6-6-2.
[3613.10 - 3617.10] P:1798.88 E:0.094350 |  And in the fourth round, he could face the great Norweck Djokovic,
[3617.10 - 3620.10] P:1684.70 E:0.088866 |  who leads by the first game against Philipp Misalich
[3620.10 - 3622.10] P:1718.58 E:0.089092 |  out on court for Lepchiatrie.
[3622.10 - 3624.10] P:1592.49 E:0.107685 |  Abigail, thank you.
[3624.10 - 3628.10] P:1727.04 E:0.107550 |  The noise you can hear is a PSG party.
[3628.10 - 3631.10] P:1672.15 E:0.104807 |  Jules, as much as you can translate, what are they singing,
[3631.10 - 3633.10] P:1761.53 E:0.102046 |  and how does that make you feel?
[3633.10 - 3634.10] P:1711.07 E:0.114058 |  The image is remarkable.
[3634.10 - 3636.10] P:1574.37 E:0.089337 |  Scarves up, bouncing up and down.
[3636.10 - 3638.10] P:1724.14 E:0.097699 |  The Allianz is alive.
[3638.10 - 3639.10] P:1776.81 E:0.104867 |  I'm getting so emotional.
[3639.10 - 3641.10] P:1731.68 E:0.103752 |  This is my children's favourite channel as well.
[3641.10 - 3643.10] P:1733.68 E:0.091184 |  They're right opposite us there,
[3643.10 - 3645.10] P:1618.80 E:0.102753 |  with my cousins and my best friend.
[3645.10 - 3647.10] P:1689.98 E:0.100088 |  It's basically saying,
[3647.10 - 3650.10] P:1596.14 E:0.105821 |  I'm not going to sing because my voice is Paris-Egé.
[3650.10 - 3653.10] P:1771.55 E:0.104723 |  All together we will sing all the love we have for you
[3653.10 - 3655.10] P:1807.45 E:0.078375 |  that will never stop.
[3655.10 - 3658.10] P:1771.84 E:0.106966 |  After so many years of fights and struggle,
[3658.10 - 3660.10] P:1646.00 E:0.107069 |  all Paris-Egé,
[3660.10 - 3663.10] P:1639.66 E:0.109625 |  we're going to break our voice for you.
[3672.10 - 3678.10] P:1711.64 E:0.088254 |  Jules, has that song ever hit home for you, like tonight?
[3678.10 - 3680.10] P:1922.06 E:0.104953 |  I mean, the way I've not heard it before,
[3680.10 - 3682.10] P:1813.53 E:0.084417 |  but you might as well have been telling us a song
[3682.10 - 3684.10] P:1735.11 E:0.085017 |  that was written for this evening.
[3684.10 - 3685.10] P:1388.95 E:0.106659 |  Incredible.
[3685.10 - 3687.10] P:1763.34 E:0.098754 |  I mean, this is for me,
[3687.10 - 3690.10] P:1492.57 E:0.093063 |  going back 40 years when I first went to the Paris-Depart,
[3690.10 - 3692.10] P:1725.97 E:0.090288 |  when I was four years old with my dad,
[3692.10 - 3694.10] P:1701.43 E:0.090632 |  that song was already on then.
[3694.10 - 3697.10] P:1758.53 E:0.079482 |  And now for it to be sung here,
[3697.10 - 3700.10] P:1787.19 E:0.103739 |  on the Champions League final with my children there,
[3700.10 - 3702.10] P:1778.22 E:0.090519 |  singing here at the same time.
[3702.10 - 3705.10] P:1783.47 E:0.097318 |  I promise you, my heart is just pumping so hard.
[3705.10 - 3708.10] P:1645.62 E:0.099509 |  Jules, were you able to go to Lisbon?
[3708.10 - 3710.10] P:1711.13 E:0.107057 |  No, I wasn't.
[3710.10 - 3713.10] P:1656.77 E:0.107972 |  So none of us were able to get there, so that means all of all.
[3713.10 - 3715.10] P:1782.82 E:0.110339 |  Absolutely, and that's why maybe I'm so stressed right now,
[3715.10 - 3717.10] P:1665.37 E:0.094706 |  I'm so invested,
[3717.10 - 3719.10] P:1767.51 E:0.108665 |  because I've never experienced this before.
[3719.10 - 3720.10] P:1702.85 E:0.116938 |  Neither have those fans,
[3720.10 - 3723.10] P:1780.13 E:0.100315 |  neither have my children or the rest of the family,
[3723.10 - 3725.10] P:1980.34 E:0.104459 |  so it's a very special night,
[3725.10 - 3727.10] P:1689.38 E:0.102750 |  and I guess if you win it, it's even more special.
[3727.10 - 3729.10] P:1874.54 E:0.077956 |  If you don't, then you'll cry your eyes out.
[3729.10 - 3732.10] P:1880.19 E:0.101455 |  Just in the last sort of 30 seconds, so quickly,
[3732.10 - 3734.10] P:1757.63 E:0.098761 |  it was like the covers coming on at Wimbledon,
[3734.10 - 3737.10] P:1832.59 E:0.094112 |  but even faster, all of a sudden,
[3737.10 - 3740.10] P:1876.17 E:0.085594 |  a black and purple and white carpet
[3740.10 - 3743.10] P:1779.49 E:0.092908 |  has emerged inside the Allianz Arena
[3743.10 - 3745.10] P:1796.17 E:0.090206 |  and been rushed right across it.
[3745.10 - 3747.10] P:1779.20 E:0.097986 |  In the next three or four minutes,
[3747.10 - 3750.10] P:1855.46 E:0.091773 |  we'll be underway with what they call it, the kickoff show.
[3750.10 - 3753.10] P:1878.57 E:0.092269 |  So just for the sake of everybody's sanity,
[3753.10 - 3755.10] P:1802.14 E:0.096466 |  I'm going to tell you how that'll go.
[3755.10 - 3758.10] P:1832.20 E:0.090190 |  The brilliant Lincoln Park,
[3758.10 - 3761.10] P:1760.80 E:0.087753 |  Lincoln Park will walk out,
[3761.10 - 3764.10] P:1846.84 E:0.106476 |  and either we'll be able to hear ourselves think or we won't.
[3764.10 - 3767.10] P:1939.65 E:0.080006 |  If we can, we'll play you Pettichek.
[3767.10 - 3769.10] P:1859.81 E:0.082697 |  If we can, we'll wait a minute
[3769.10 - 3771.10] P:1879.28 E:0.091392 |  and then play you Pettichek anyway,
[3771.10 - 3773.10] P:1740.36 E:0.095219 |  talking about the two goalkeepers.
[3773.10 - 3775.10] P:1975.24 E:0.101204 |  But the paraphernalia, John, is now on its way on.
[3775.10 - 3776.10] P:1904.65 E:0.102933 |  There are the drums.
[3776.10 - 3778.10] P:1804.24 E:0.101603 |  Yeah, I think of those two options,
[3778.10 - 3780.10] P:1760.19 E:0.096902 |  I think we'll be hearing from Pettichek.
[3780.10 - 3782.10] P:1889.28 E:0.100974 |  Yeah, I think you might be right.
[3782.10 - 3783.10] P:1781.45 E:0.065588 |  Cross it.
[3783.10 - 3786.10] P:1779.28 E:0.100858 |  To shut Jules up, they're playing the Inter-Anthonyl right now,
[3786.10 - 3788.10] P:1827.28 E:0.102138 |  which is Chess Sololimpire.
[3788.10 - 3789.10] P:1803.83 E:0.100239 |  There's only Inter.
[3789.10 - 3792.10] P:1757.38 E:0.099613 |  No PSG, no Julien LeRons.
[3792.10 - 3794.10] P:1832.24 E:0.082014 |  Only Inter at this moment in time.
[3794.10 - 3797.10] P:1817.03 E:0.085626 |  And on that, James, the Inter fans,
[3797.10 - 3799.10] P:1820.91 E:0.105465 |  we can see some of them on the big screen.
[3799.10 - 3801.10] P:1744.01 E:0.102629 |  There's a guy whose pictures come on the big screen,
[3801.10 - 3804.10] P:1785.96 E:0.089018 |  who, you know, it's Vane's coming out of his head.
[3804.10 - 3806.10] P:1869.35 E:0.090075 |  All of the passion in there.
[3806.10 - 3809.10] P:1786.62 E:0.092098 |  You know, you can have won this cup before
[3809.10 - 3812.10] P:1813.04 E:0.093785 |  and still want it as much as somebody who has never won it.
[3812.10 - 3815.10] P:1845.29 E:0.088568 |  And it just feels so much 2010.
[3815.10 - 3818.10] P:1840.73 E:0.089725 |  A great manager linked with a move away.
[3818.10 - 3819.10] P:1979.92 E:0.096880 |  The last chance for a side,
[3819.10 - 3821.10] P:2025.51 E:0.088989 |  they will feel there's a bit of destiny here.
[3821.10 - 3824.10] P:1872.80 E:0.094564 |  Yeah, although I put that to Matteo Damian on Monday,
[3824.10 - 3826.10] P:1892.90 E:0.090951 |  he said, do not mention destiny.
[3826.10 - 3827.10] P:1805.60 E:0.102564 |  We're superstitious around here.
[3827.10 - 3829.10] P:1765.48 E:0.094192 |  You know, please don't talk about that.
[3829.10 - 3833.10] P:1915.94 E:0.062927 |  But I wonder what it's like, Crossy,
[3833.10 - 3837.10] P:1755.13 E:0.089465 |  because is it an advantage to have played in a final two years ago
[3837.10 - 3838.10] P:1590.81 E:0.088318 |  and to have come up close,
[3838.10 - 3840.10] P:1852.02 E:0.101098 |  to have already lived all these moments
[3840.10 - 3842.10] P:1881.50 E:0.090848 |  that are new for the PSG players?
[3842.10 - 3844.10] P:1668.98 E:0.081088 |  Or does it actually bring more pressure
[3844.10 - 3847.10] P:1808.04 E:0.087630 |  because you're like, well, we lost last time around.
[3847.10 - 3848.10] P:1812.46 E:0.108358 |  If we lose this time around,
[3848.10 - 3850.10] P:1702.85 E:0.077783 |  we're never coming back to this
[3850.10 - 3853.10] P:1833.09 E:0.082461 |  with this group of players who are, with an average age,
[3853.10 - 3855.10] P:1766.07 E:0.080412 |  the oldest team in the knockout stages.
[3855.10 - 3858.10] P:1735.65 E:0.093572 |  Are Italians some of the most superstitious people in Europe?
[3858.10 - 3860.10] P:1704.03 E:0.091730 |  They are very much so.
[3860.10 - 3862.10] P:1749.60 E:0.089429 |  I mean, they talk about this thing called...
[3862.10 - 3863.10] P:1805.36 E:0.078970 |  The thing with the shirt.
[3863.10 - 3864.10] P:1819.48 E:0.091290 |  Yes.
[3864.10 - 3865.10] P:1569.09 E:0.076970 |  The drill today.
[3865.10 - 3867.10] P:1661.95 E:0.090108 |  Yes, I mean, that was an in-joke
[3867.10 - 3869.10] P:1705.59 E:0.091797 |  between Lautado and Barela yesterday
[3869.10 - 3873.10] P:1798.22 E:0.088210 |  where they were asked why the yellow shirt, not the white shirt.
[3873.10 - 3875.10] P:1748.05 E:0.075220 |  And they kind of just looked at each other,
[3875.10 - 3877.10] P:1742.90 E:0.081111 |  laughed, and then didn't give us an answer.
[3877.10 - 3880.10] P:1671.28 E:0.091656 |  I mean, there was about fourth coming with the finances
[3880.10 - 3882.10] P:1834.29 E:0.077543 |  in Zaghi was on his future.
[3882.10 - 3886.10] P:1787.48 E:0.090424 |  But the only match they'd lost in the Champions League this season
[3886.10 - 3890.10] P:1676.61 E:0.090481 |  was wearing the white shirt when they were beaten by Levicusen.
[3890.10 - 3891.10] P:1563.09 E:0.096389 |  So...
[3891.10 - 3893.10] P:1738.98 E:0.081615 |  Yeah, superstition.
[3893.10 - 3894.10] P:1859.29 E:0.069815 |  Scaramantico.
[3894.10 - 3897.10] P:1840.68 E:0.097415 |  You're superstitious in Italian.
[3897.10 - 3898.10] P:1880.68 E:0.081128 |  Scaramantico.
[3898.10 - 3899.10] P:1753.70 E:0.086105 |  Scaramantico.
[3899.10 - 3902.10] P:1863.53 E:0.115203 |  That's going on the commentator's view on BBC Sound.
[3902.10 - 3904.10] P:1837.50 E:0.083205 |  And the other thing is...
[3904.10 - 3905.10] P:1753.75 E:0.079024 |  Guffando.
[3905.10 - 3907.10] P:1770.50 E:0.076909 |  Guffando means literally...
[3907.10 - 3908.10] P:1804.89 E:0.079702 |  Owling.
[3908.10 - 3910.10] P:1874.53 E:0.088828 |  Okay? A gufo is an owl.
[3910.10 - 3911.10] P:1787.30 E:0.085523 |  Okay?
[3911.10 - 3913.10] P:1787.14 E:0.077470 |  And what they will do is they...
[3913.10 - 3915.10] P:1841.92 E:0.097080 |  to be superstitious,
[3915.10 - 3917.10] P:1828.19 E:0.084094 |  if I were an Interfan right now, I'd say,
[3917.10 - 3918.10] P:1817.73 E:0.084667 |  PSG 3-0.
[3918.10 - 3919.10] P:1759.18 E:0.067368 |  PSG are going to walk this.
[3919.10 - 3922.10] P:1769.51 E:0.093797 |  Because you say the opposite of what you actually want to happen.
[3922.10 - 3923.10] P:1557.90 E:0.079498 |  That is Guffando.
[3923.10 - 3925.10] P:1706.57 E:0.079110 |  That is being an owl.
[3925.10 - 3926.10] P:1699.84 E:0.066854 |  Ha ha ha.
[3926.10 - 3928.10] P:1892.46 E:0.087048 |  And just now on the pitch in front of us,
[3928.10 - 3930.10] P:1904.29 E:0.094548 |  there's loads of spotlights, there's a stage,
[3930.10 - 3932.10] P:1788.92 E:0.076440 |  there's a big drum kit set up.
[3932.10 - 3933.10] P:1875.11 E:0.099121 |  Lots of people have emerged.
[3933.10 - 3935.10] P:2103.36 E:0.098045 |  You were sort of evolved in the show here.
[3935.10 - 3938.10] P:1921.83 E:0.079354 |  In big white sort of pond shows,
[3938.10 - 3939.10] P:1762.55 E:0.080276 |  I can tell they're involved in the show,
[3939.10 - 3941.10] P:2041.93 E:0.094578 |  because if they weren't, they wouldn't need them.
[3941.10 - 3942.10] P:1895.00 E:0.078483 |  It's still baking hot.
[3942.10 - 3944.10] P:1868.06 E:0.073321 |  They sort of look like
[3944.10 - 3946.10] P:1950.85 E:0.091368 |  Rebel Alliance soldiers from Star Wars,
[3946.10 - 3949.10] P:1841.61 E:0.086200 |  with the big kind of hats coming up over the top of their heads.
[3949.10 - 3953.10] P:1989.21 E:0.067373 |  They're all stood, absolutely, stock still.
[3953.10 - 3956.10] P:1832.52 E:0.081862 |  And Linkin Park are now on the stage.
[3956.10 - 3958.10] P:1728.70 E:0.087693 |  I think for many, many people listening of a...
[3958.10 - 3960.10] P:1894.16 E:0.086737 |  Probably of a certain age, I'm about to turn 40.
[3960.10 - 3965.10] P:1787.37 E:0.076321 |  They're a massive band from that era of the Nauties.
[3965.10 - 3968.10] P:1924.72 E:0.093221 |  And it is how it goes these days with the Champions League final
[3968.10 - 3969.10] P:1832.19 E:0.065745 |  and the kickoff shows.
[3969.10 - 3971.10] P:2021.31 E:0.088534 |  Last year it was Lenny Kravitz.
[3971.10 - 3973.10] P:1748.58 E:0.076089 |  This year it's Linkin Park.
[3973.10 - 3977.10] P:1862.64 E:0.073624 |  So there's still this just huge carpet
[3977.10 - 3980.10] P:1936.91 E:0.074603 |  right across the pitch, over the centre circle,
[3980.10 - 3982.10] P:1970.49 E:0.081806 |  right towards the two goals.
[3982.10 - 3983.10] P:1670.32 E:0.070678 |  John.
[3983.10 - 3986.10] P:1867.58 E:0.092516 |  It's quite a radical choice, isn't it, Linkin Park for UEFA.
[3986.10 - 3987.10] P:1832.73 E:0.097093 |  What is it?
[3987.10 - 3988.10] P:1825.75 E:0.113578 |  They've got cool.
[3988.10 - 3991.10] P:1867.12 E:0.091312 |  I think, you know, after their Bars at Inter semi-final,
[3991.10 - 3993.10] P:1684.02 E:0.117104 |  they want an encore.
[3993.10 - 3994.10] P:1748.15 E:0.095956 |  There you go.
[3994.10 - 3996.10] P:1681.53 E:0.101888 |  You don't know you're Linkin Park, do you?
[3996.10 - 3998.10] P:1837.35 E:0.108688 |  I all know my Linkin Park inside, Alster.
[3998.10 - 3999.10] P:1587.09 E:0.107070 |  There were an encore, though.
[3999.10 - 4000.10] P:1528.22 E:0.089752 |  It's very good.
[4000.10 - 4001.10] P:1599.26 E:0.075980 |  Very good.
[4001.10 - 4003.10] P:1811.32 E:0.105707 |  Right, Linkin Park are on the stage.
[4003.10 - 4006.10] P:1747.69 E:0.100953 |  Now the lights are absolutely beaming out as bright as anything.
[4006.10 - 4008.10] P:1742.68 E:0.100701 |  So John, do you think we should...
[4008.10 - 4010.10] P:1694.20 E:0.092623 |  Should we hear from Pettichek, do you think?
[4010.10 - 4011.10] P:1667.49 E:0.108951 |  I think that might be a good idea.
[4011.10 - 4013.10] P:1781.49 E:0.104531 |  Yeah, I think this is about the right time for it.
[4013.10 - 4015.10] P:2016.92 E:0.095561 |  All right, so we're talking goalkeepers
[4015.10 - 4018.10] P:1831.73 E:0.109215 |  as the fireworks start here inside the Allianz.
[4018.10 - 4020.10] P:1856.15 E:0.104434 |  Gigi Donnaruma for PSG,
[4020.10 - 4022.10] P:1902.04 E:0.099276 |  Jan Sonner for Inter.
[4022.10 - 4025.10] P:1882.56 E:0.105011 |  I've been getting a neutral opinion from Pettichek,
[4025.10 - 4030.10] P:1799.04 E:0.104954 |  who won the Champions League here at the Allianz with Chelsea in 2012.
[4030.10 - 4033.10] P:1407.62 E:0.102111 |  You know, the reason why those two teams are in the final,
[4033.10 - 4035.10] P:1508.76 E:0.100615 |  particularly in both semifinal games,
[4035.10 - 4037.10] P:1344.34 E:0.101394 |  Jan Zomar against Barcelona
[4037.10 - 4041.10] P:1416.74 E:0.093014 |  and Gigi Donnaruma against Arsenal,
[4041.10 - 4044.10] P:1410.73 E:0.095551 |  you can clearly see that they help their teams
[4044.10 - 4047.10] P:1338.22 E:0.087535 |  to go through because they made important saves,
[4047.10 - 4049.10] P:1405.59 E:0.091510 |  big saves in important times.
[4049.10 - 4052.10] P:1350.98 E:0.095968 |  Both teams will rely on their goalkeepers, of course, in the final.
[4052.10 - 4055.10] P:2029.12 E:0.083770 |  Gigi and Jan are very different goalkeepers, aren't they?
[4055.10 - 4057.10] P:1745.59 E:0.089623 |  Gigi's got that real sort of big personality.
[4057.10 - 4059.10] P:1455.25 E:0.102249 |  Yeah, of course they are both different,
[4059.10 - 4061.10] P:1461.16 E:0.105400 |  but even Gigi, he's younger,
[4061.10 - 4063.10] P:1711.38 E:0.082600 |  but he has a lot of experience already,
[4063.10 - 4067.10] P:1293.43 E:0.104037 |  playing for the top clubs and playing for Italy,
[4067.10 - 4071.10] P:1535.77 E:0.102541 |  obviously winning the Euros, where he played big part in the tournament.
[4071.10 - 4073.10] P:1555.00 E:0.109930 |  Obviously he has this experience already,
[4073.10 - 4075.10] P:1508.46 E:0.084791 |  so he can use that.
[4075.10 - 4079.10] P:1575.07 E:0.090921 |  He's a big goalkeeper, he manages to make his presence count.
[4079.10 - 4084.10] P:1503.96 E:0.086736 |  But Jan, I think I have to say, for a goalkeeper,
[4084.10 - 4087.10] P:1704.69 E:0.087485 |  a lot of people don't talk too much about it.
[4087.10 - 4089.10] P:1547.92 E:0.100970 |  He's always there.
[4089.10 - 4091.10] P:1266.71 E:0.098608 |  He's been there ever since he started playing European football
[4091.10 - 4093.10] P:1214.07 E:0.105316 |  with Switzerland and with Basel.
[4093.10 - 4096.10] P:1192.23 E:0.084191 |  He's been always a great performer.
[4096.10 - 4099.10] P:1704.22 E:0.107531 |  And I think especially this season with Inter,
[4099.10 - 4101.10] P:1447.78 E:0.076343 |  he plays one of his best football,
[4101.10 - 4106.10] P:1269.57 E:0.095301 |  and I think he will obviously be an important piece in the Basel for Inter.
[4106.10 - 4109.10] P:1695.76 E:0.091202 |  And I know this is a very English question to ask,
[4109.10 - 4112.10] P:1559.51 E:0.089361 |  but are you surprised we've not seen either of them in the Premier League?
[4112.10 - 4116.10] P:1315.38 E:0.090305 |  Everybody has different pathways, everybody has a different career.
[4116.10 - 4119.10] P:1179.34 E:0.084526 |  When you look at, for example, the Naruma case,
[4119.10 - 4126.10] P:1138.82 E:0.086918 |  obviously in the moment, you know, the top teams in England
[4126.10 - 4130.10] P:1285.19 E:0.090646 |  probably didn't need a goalkeeper to sign,
[4130.10 - 4134.10] P:1312.49 E:0.094909 |  and then he committed to Paris Saint-Germain,
[4134.10 - 4137.10] P:1280.40 E:0.096860 |  and obviously I don't think they will let him go just easily.
[4137.10 - 4140.10] P:1260.37 E:0.086543 |  So this is obviously a big difference as well.
[4140.10 - 4142.10] P:1693.69 E:0.096483 |  Just to finish on Jan specifically then,
[4142.10 - 4144.10] P:1597.81 E:0.089667 |  do you think he's been a bit underrated?
[4144.10 - 4147.10] P:1517.66 E:0.090153 |  Well, if you ask the Swiss national team,
[4147.10 - 4150.10] P:1088.92 E:0.106386 |  people and players and everybody, you will know how valuable he was
[4150.10 - 4152.10] P:1562.88 E:0.086227 |  for all those years.
[4152.10 - 4155.10] P:1166.43 E:0.086890 |  If you ask people in Basel, in Minkengladbach,
[4155.10 - 4157.10] P:1263.85 E:0.091147 |  he was a great performer.
[4157.10 - 4159.10] P:1455.96 E:0.109299 |  If you ask people at Inter, he will always tell you he's a great performer.
[4159.10 - 4162.10] P:1474.50 E:0.097421 |  So he's one of those goalkeepers who always deliver.
[4162.10 - 4165.10] P:1425.28 E:0.100895 |  Maybe you don't notice as much, but he always delivers.
[4165.10 - 4169.10] P:1860.67 E:0.081283 |  That's Petr Cech, and we can check in.
[4169.10 - 4171.10] P:1766.54 E:0.100733 |  The French open with Abigail Johnson.
[4171.10 - 4173.10] P:1542.01 E:0.092551 |  Yeah, we're on the main stage here.
[4173.10 - 4177.10] P:1696.31 E:0.095477 |  It is actually impressively populated on Court Philippe Chatriet,
[4177.10 - 4179.10] P:1963.39 E:0.095367 |  given that we're in the French capital
[4179.10 - 4182.10] P:1527.09 E:0.096086 |  and there is the Champions League final coming up.
[4182.10 - 4185.10] P:1550.15 E:0.091816 |  But Novak Djokovic with a strong start to one
[4185.10 - 4187.10] P:1240.18 E:0.085591 |  against the qualifier from Austria,
[4187.10 - 4191.10] P:1577.02 E:0.093851 |  Philippe Misalich, whose career high ranking is world number 126.
[4191.10 - 4193.10] P:1577.97 E:0.086668 |  To put this in perspective,
[4193.10 - 4195.10] P:1657.01 E:0.095390 |  Misalich, who came through qualifying here,
[4195.10 - 4199.10] P:1739.87 E:0.097650 |  has never played in the main draw at the other three Grand Slams.
[4199.10 - 4203.10] P:1853.52 E:0.084946 |  So this is a huge task against the world number six
[4203.10 - 4205.10] P:1712.67 E:0.080449 |  of the presence, Djokovic,
[4205.10 - 4209.10] P:1825.03 E:0.093969 |  who is on a 19-match winning streak on Parisian clay.
[4209.10 - 4211.10] P:1769.90 E:0.094810 |  Got to be keeping a close eye on this under the lights.
[4211.10 - 4213.10] P:1625.96 E:0.089352 |  Djokovic on serve.
[4213.10 - 4215.10] P:1795.99 E:0.077022 |  Abigail, thank you very much.
[4215.10 - 4220.10] P:1819.95 E:0.102353 |  We're back here inside the Allianz Arena with 10 minutes to kick off.
[4220.10 - 4223.10] P:1868.42 E:0.102388 |  The Champions League final is on the way.
[4223.10 - 4225.10] P:1797.04 E:0.098609 |  Harry Sajaman and Inter Milan,
[4225.10 - 4229.10] P:1842.35 E:0.098659 |  I reckon we're about two-thirds through Lincoln Park.
[4229.10 - 4232.10] P:2006.81 E:0.097539 |  If it wasn't for the fact that we've got such a fascinating
[4232.10 - 4234.10] P:1832.75 E:0.102613 |  Champions League final on the way,
[4234.10 - 4236.10] P:1866.89 E:0.100557 |  I would... James, I would hear the encore.
[4236.10 - 4238.10] P:2006.46 E:0.089607 |  They could do this song again.
[4238.10 - 4243.10] P:1898.77 E:0.086764 |  Look, I just think if we have an encore of that Champions League semi-final
[4243.10 - 4245.10] P:1939.84 E:0.074714 |  from a few weeks ago between these two teams,
[4245.10 - 4248.10] P:1845.45 E:0.106025 |  I think they match up very similarly as well.
[4248.10 - 4251.10] P:1851.22 E:0.100498 |  PSG and Inter, as PSG and Inter and Barca did.
[4251.10 - 4253.10] P:1783.06 E:0.088301 |  Yeah, we'll settle for that.
[4253.10 - 4255.10] P:1934.55 E:0.107122 |  Just before we let you go then, James,
[4255.10 - 4257.10] P:1834.42 E:0.092069 |  I do want to ask you one-on, Yams Summer,
[4257.10 - 4261.10] P:1845.65 E:0.100574 |  Petter Cech there saying, effectively, he thinks he's underrated.
[4261.10 - 4263.10] P:1845.10 E:0.107658 |  Edmund van der Sar said the same thing to me.
[4263.10 - 4267.10] P:1827.79 E:0.102740 |  Rob Green said the same thing to all of us earlier.
[4267.10 - 4269.10] P:1807.15 E:0.123724 |  I think you could say that sums up Inter.
[4269.10 - 4271.10] P:1803.91 E:0.112528 |  Sums up Lautaro, underrated.
[4271.10 - 4273.10] P:1828.52 E:0.106124 |  Sums up the team as a whole.
[4273.10 - 4274.10] P:1863.94 E:0.115883 |  Sums up Summer.
[4274.10 - 4278.10] P:1847.12 E:0.109133 |  I mean, two years ago, when Inter lost the final,
[4278.10 - 4281.10] P:1935.32 E:0.105942 |  Pep did that thing that Pep does where he says,
[4281.10 - 4282.10] P:1795.27 E:0.108652 |  I was so, so hard.
[4282.10 - 4284.10] P:1927.91 E:0.103095 |  So, so hard because we couldn't press Inter.
[4284.10 - 4286.10] P:1915.77 E:0.107041 |  Why couldn't they press Inter?
[4286.10 - 4289.10] P:1889.41 E:0.108238 |  Because O'Nana was so good with the boys' feet,
[4289.10 - 4292.10] P:1828.49 E:0.104191 |  so good at sweeping, playing over the press,
[4292.10 - 4295.10] P:1712.15 E:0.097357 |  that selling O'Nana, many United fans and English football fans,
[4295.10 - 4296.10] P:1749.08 E:0.106385 |  were like, what are you saying, Horncastle?
[4296.10 - 4298.10] P:1776.17 E:0.090143 |  This is crazy. O'Nana.
[4298.10 - 4302.10] P:1813.73 E:0.089161 |  But Yams Summer had big gloves to fill,
[4302.10 - 4305.10] P:1826.73 E:0.103120 |  and he's done it, set record clean sheets in his first season.
[4305.10 - 4308.10] P:1733.50 E:0.101082 |  And for a guy, we're talking with this one, Rob Green earlier.
[4308.10 - 4311.10] P:1646.80 E:0.083479 |  He's only six foot. He's not big for a goalkeeper.
[4311.10 - 4317.10] P:1801.89 E:0.104560 |  And yet, his presence, his ability to make himself look big in that goal,
[4317.10 - 4322.10] P:1857.28 E:0.108232 |  he makes such big saves in that semi-final against Barcelona.
[4322.10 - 4324.10] P:1889.87 E:0.115172 |  Everyone talks about the Lameen one,
[4324.10 - 4326.10] P:1888.38 E:0.110053 |  but the one in the stadium on Erick Garcia,
[4326.10 - 4328.10] P:1838.42 E:0.108358 |  after Barcelona just started their comeback,
[4328.10 - 4330.10] P:1837.94 E:0.109292 |  felt massive in the stadium.
[4330.10 - 4332.10] P:1914.77 E:0.119431 |  Can I just ask James quickly?
[4332.10 - 4335.10] P:1795.50 E:0.117761 |  James, earlier you said you thought Inter would win.
[4335.10 - 4339.10] P:1789.30 E:0.096797 |  Tell us why you have that much belief that they will do so.
[4339.10 - 4341.10] P:1806.60 E:0.085855 |  Because I think you can't kill this team.
[4341.10 - 4345.10] P:1762.37 E:0.093729 |  I think they showed that here, at this stadium in the quarter-final,
[4345.10 - 4348.10] P:1932.71 E:0.100264 |  when Thomas Muller came off the bench, scored an equaliser,
[4348.10 - 4350.10] P:1921.79 E:0.105379 |  everyone thought, oh no, here we go again, Inter.
[4350.10 - 4353.10] P:1914.92 E:0.080804 |  Fratese, 90th minute, scores the winner.
[4353.10 - 4357.10] P:1799.91 E:0.081746 |  We saw in that semi-final against Barcelona, they tune it up,
[4357.10 - 4360.10] P:1591.73 E:0.086697 |  three-two down in the 87th minute, people are filing out,
[4360.10 - 4362.10] P:1490.68 E:0.097538 |  Inter fans are leaving,
[4362.10 - 4365.10] P:1567.15 E:0.093505 |  Maka Matarazzi, the legend in the VIP seats, he's leaving,
[4365.10 - 4369.10] P:1649.78 E:0.092701 |  but no, a chair to be goes up, he scores, Fratese gets the winner again.
[4369.10 - 4372.10] P:1687.31 E:0.097494 |  It's a team that is very, very hard to put away.
[4372.10 - 4374.10] P:1695.10 E:0.083250 |  I'm sorry, Jules, I'm really sorry.
[4374.10 - 4376.10] P:1880.58 E:0.099167 |  I agree with you completely.
[4376.10 - 4379.10] P:1921.48 E:0.108514 |  Let me ask you one on Donnerrumber, then James,
[4379.10 - 4385.10] P:1958.91 E:0.099551 |  because obviously he is right in the Venn diagram of you and Julian Laran, isn't he?
[4385.10 - 4387.10] P:2012.46 E:0.102202 |  We were saying when he stood out there,
[4387.10 - 4390.10] P:1934.79 E:0.091088 |  it sort of reminds me a bit of Harland in the sense that
[4390.10 - 4394.10] P:1922.93 E:0.089104 |  you do have to see him in person to realise just how big he is.
[4394.10 - 4399.10] P:1797.37 E:0.090365 |  If you're in a mix zone with him, it's like being with an NBA player.
[4399.10 - 4402.10] P:1822.93 E:0.087164 |  The only player I've had a similar experience with is Latin,
[4402.10 - 4405.10] P:1792.27 E:0.106405 |  every one of us, it's just towering over you.
[4405.10 - 4410.10] P:1717.30 E:0.105466 |  And there are goalkeepers, we spoke to Rob Green who was talking about
[4410.10 - 4414.10] P:1858.85 E:0.101238 |  how great he is at getting down for his size.
[4414.10 - 4416.10] P:1823.50 E:0.107572 |  But I would say the thing that separates
[4416.10 - 4420.10] P:1867.03 E:0.100049 |  Gianluigi Donnerrumber above everyone is his composure,
[4420.10 - 4422.10] P:1889.66 E:0.102969 |  his ability to stay cool.
[4422.10 - 4427.10] P:1861.34 E:0.105711 |  That's why Sinisa Mahalovic gave him his debut at 16 for AC Milan at San Siro.
[4427.10 - 4433.10] P:1896.23 E:0.100579 |  That's a very difficult place to play, and yet he took that all in his stride.
[4433.10 - 4436.10] P:1816.51 E:0.107535 |  And you know, there's been all these doubts about him.
[4436.10 - 4441.10] P:1857.42 E:0.093899 |  You know, I mean, take moments, you think of that Euro's final at Wembley,
[4441.10 - 4444.10] P:1821.50 E:0.092321 |  at Wembley, home final for England,
[4444.10 - 4449.10] P:1858.07 E:0.092941 |  and he's the guy who is the hero of that night for the penalties that he saves.
[4449.10 - 4453.10] P:1803.83 E:0.093179 |  You know, I mean, for someone who's 26, he's played for a decade already,
[4453.10 - 4458.10] P:1796.20 E:0.091637 |  he's very, very experienced for still a relatively young head.
[4458.10 - 4461.10] P:1823.80 E:0.103902 |  James, lovely to have you on, thank you so much.
[4461.10 - 4465.10] P:1931.95 E:0.090200 |  Next up at pitchside, Javier Pastore and Javier Zanetti
[4465.10 - 4469.10] P:1782.89 E:0.079092 |  have just put the European Cup on its plinth.
[4469.10 - 4473.10] P:1828.16 E:0.089539 |  There is a violinist playing in the centre of the pitch at the minute.
[4473.10 - 4477.10] P:1829.09 E:0.096390 |  They've just pulled back a little bit of the purple and black carpet.
[4477.10 - 4479.10] P:1770.12 E:0.098027 |  And there sits the European Cup.
[4479.10 - 4485.10] P:1803.24 E:0.092029 |  Blue, red, shades of blue, into Milan, Paris Saint-Germain.
[4485.10 - 4488.10] P:1833.32 E:0.099473 |  Jules, I'll ask you about Donnerrumber as well,
[4488.10 - 4491.10] P:1882.97 E:0.098854 |  but what are we witnessing away to our left-hand side?
[4491.10 - 4494.10] P:1745.50 E:0.106188 |  Yeah, it's one of the T-Force from the Paris Ultra.
[4494.10 - 4496.10] P:1802.83 E:0.112041 |  I mean, it only says Paris Saint-Germain,
[4496.10 - 4499.10] P:1846.01 E:0.097241 |  but they have all the bottom side of these stands and at the top,
[4499.10 - 4501.10] P:1921.24 E:0.095722 |  the crest of the club,
[4501.10 - 4505.10] P:1907.35 E:0.096403 |  and they're obviously crest of the City of Paris to here.
[4505.10 - 4507.10] P:1979.97 E:0.095779 |  Looks absolutely fantastic.
[4507.10 - 4510.10] P:1847.26 E:0.096867 |  Right across the bottom tier, that word, Paris,
[4510.10 - 4513.10] P:1940.85 E:0.092728 |  and then the club crest filling the hole of the second tier.
[4513.10 - 4517.10] P:1870.86 E:0.088236 |  Only the top, the gods of the stadium, you can't see it.
[4517.10 - 4521.10] P:1921.46 E:0.093552 |  So, Donnerrumber Jules, have you stopped worrying about him in big finals?
[4521.10 - 4523.10] P:1968.49 E:0.083507 |  He just comes to the party.
[4523.10 - 4527.10] P:1715.92 E:0.087015 |  He does. The only thing I would say, and he's been incredible in 2025,
[4527.10 - 4531.10] P:1271.84 E:0.081016 |  is that he's seen the team, is the team that has scored the most goals on set-pieces this season
[4531.10 - 4536.10] P:1371.06 E:0.079818 |  in the Champions League, and set-pieces is a weakness for this PSG team.
[4536.10 - 4538.10] P:1768.71 E:0.099654 |  And this could be also one of the keys.
[4538.10 - 4541.10] P:1704.64 E:0.080522 |  We've mentioned many keys, many match-ups between players, tactically,
[4541.10 - 4545.10] P:1678.46 E:0.094015 |  the midfield, the experience, the youth, the weather, the heat, everything you want.
[4545.10 - 4549.10] P:1605.17 E:0.085439 |  Set-pieces is another one, and let's see who deals with it better
[4549.10 - 4553.10] P:1353.35 E:0.079616 |  in terms of when they attack with them, PSG when they have to defend them.
[4553.10 - 4556.10] P:1407.06 E:0.084692 |  And I really think that it's the kind of finals as well
[4556.10 - 4559.10] P:1397.84 E:0.088730 |  that can be won or lost on set-pieces.
[4559.10 - 4561.10] P:1702.86 E:0.083475 |  It's still really hot Jules, isn't it?
[4561.10 - 4566.10] P:1728.28 E:0.092406 |  PSG do a lot more running, 26K a game more than Inter Milan.
[4566.10 - 4568.10] P:1809.50 E:0.091060 |  Both teams really are going to go through it here.
[4568.10 - 4570.10] P:1421.86 E:0.085788 |  Yeah, I think so. Let's see what Inter do.
[4570.10 - 4574.10] P:1751.88 E:0.090750 |  We talked before with Danny and Chris, are they going to sit really deep?
[4574.10 - 4578.10] P:1792.38 E:0.087622 |  We don't think so, but they will have to hit PSG in transitions quickly.
[4578.10 - 4582.10] P:1728.35 E:0.095775 |  And that's tiring as well, because when you have the ball,
[4582.10 - 4587.10] P:1772.25 E:0.091714 |  the PSG have more of the ball, and the move is harder to run after it
[4587.10 - 4588.10] P:1643.04 E:0.096338 |  than to have it in your feet.
[4588.10 - 4590.10] P:1845.29 E:0.075168 |  Jules, great stuff. Thank you.
[4590.10 - 4591.10] P:1796.59 E:0.092362 |  Thank you.
[4591.10 - 4592.10] P:1810.72 E:0.080583 |  And listen, try and enjoy it.
[4592.10 - 4593.10] P:1771.36 E:0.084759 |  I'll try.
[4593.10 - 4595.10] P:1991.38 E:0.098277 |  All right, that's Julianne Laurent here inside the Allianz Arena.
[4595.10 - 4597.10] P:2014.97 E:0.096083 |  We've got four minutes to kick off in front of us,
[4597.10 - 4601.10] P:1825.58 E:0.092300 |  the crest of Paris Saint-Germain with the Eiffel Tower in red,
[4601.10 - 4604.10] P:1837.39 E:0.092677 |  right in the centre is now being waved up and down,
[4604.10 - 4608.10] P:1857.64 E:0.096240 |  the crest of Inter Nathionale away to the right-hand side,
[4608.10 - 4610.10] P:1865.62 E:0.092066 |  the Champions League emblem in the middle,
[4610.10 - 4613.10] P:1774.05 E:0.085051 |  the European Cup sits there,
[4613.10 - 4620.10] P:1753.38 E:0.078036 |  Stock still, the players of PSG and Inter Milan walk out in front of it,
[4620.10 - 4622.10] P:1777.26 E:0.091455 |  and not one of them moves to touch it.
[4622.10 - 4626.10] P:1833.72 E:0.083553 |  I'm not sure any of them even looked at it.
[4626.10 - 4628.10] P:1928.99 E:0.098475 |  Full commentary then of the Champions League final.
[4628.10 - 4634.10] P:1745.82 E:0.090560 |  Five live BBC sounds, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan, Chris Sutton,
[4634.10 - 4636.10] P:1732.03 E:0.097002 |  and correspondent John Murray.
[4641.10 - 4643.10] P:1810.31 E:0.100745 |  Well, thank you very much, Steve.
[4643.10 - 4644.10] P:1584.69 E:0.096029 |  Thank you very much, everyone,
[4644.10 - 4648.10] P:1860.82 E:0.102401 |  because the World Service are joining us here as well in Bavaria
[4648.10 - 4653.10] P:1774.60 E:0.078001 |  for the 2025 UEFA Champions League final,
[4654.10 - 4659.10] P:1610.92 E:0.088289 |  the 70th final in the history of this great competition.
[4659.10 - 4663.10] P:1651.02 E:0.088460 |  The flags are waving, the scarves are waving,
[4663.10 - 4668.10] P:1672.92 E:0.087550 |  PSG have their Tiefel in place in the stands.
[4668.10 - 4673.10] P:1717.84 E:0.096724 |  There is quite the atmosphere inside the Munich stadium.
[4683.10 - 4687.10] P:1772.43 E:0.105596 |  Big noise coming out of both ends of the three tiers
[4687.10 - 4691.10] P:1714.37 E:0.083703 |  of the home of Bayern Munich for this,
[4691.10 - 4695.10] P:1743.06 E:0.083422 |  actually slightly offbeat Champions League final.
[4695.10 - 4700.10] P:1753.21 E:0.087640 |  Chris Sutton, I feel the fact that there is no Spanish involvement,
[4700.10 - 4704.10] P:1797.63 E:0.082870 |  no German involvement, no English involvement,
[4704.10 - 4710.10] P:1795.68 E:0.090733 |  and each of the last 20 finals have had one or both clubs from those three countries.
[4710.10 - 4712.10] P:1733.00 E:0.112857 |  That does feel really odd.
[4712.10 - 4716.10] P:1766.42 E:0.105839 |  Amarine saying it's the first time these two teams have made it.
[4716.10 - 4718.10] P:1767.63 E:0.099565 |  I mean, that's incredible.
[4718.10 - 4722.10] P:1715.75 E:0.103676 |  First time these two managers have taken on each other competitively.
[4722.10 - 4726.10] P:1837.59 E:0.109744 |  I mean, it is, you know, you chuck all those things into the mix.
[4726.10 - 4727.10] P:1834.68 E:0.112580 |  It is incredible.
[4727.10 - 4731.10] P:1914.55 E:0.104023 |  This is interim PSG, two European giants as such,
[4731.10 - 4736.10] P:1935.90 E:0.104730 |  and then you put in both teams' roots to the final PSG slow start,
[4736.10 - 4739.10] P:1940.55 E:0.105517 |  and they've finished the season so, so strongly.
[4739.10 - 4742.10] P:1888.65 E:0.092249 |  Dispatched three English teams on the way to getting here,
[4742.10 - 4745.10] P:1908.96 E:0.103826 |  and then the Wiley hold into how much of that semi-finals,
[4745.10 - 4747.10] P:1794.13 E:0.099611 |  that semi-final against Barcelona.
[4747.10 - 4750.10] P:1741.13 E:0.098718 |  That changes things quite dramatically, I feel.
[4750.10 - 4755.10] P:1712.84 E:0.096524 |  If they'd had two 1-mil wins against, I don't know, whoever it happened to be,
[4755.10 - 4758.10] P:1798.35 E:0.086281 |  but because they did that against that team,
[4758.10 - 4762.10] P:1827.04 E:0.089942 |  I think it changes the perspective completely.
[4762.10 - 4768.10] P:1752.14 E:0.097957 |  Anyway, I mean, the scene that we've got in front of us is a real feast for the sensors, isn't it?
[4768.10 - 4775.10] P:1828.57 E:0.092255 |  And the T4, the PSG T4, which said in French, together, we are unbeatable.
[4775.10 - 4778.10] P:1697.38 E:0.096707 |  That was the message that they put out across the middle of it,
[4778.10 - 4780.10] P:1831.41 E:0.094548 |  and now that's been tucked away.
[4780.10 - 4783.10] P:1861.43 E:0.099155 |  We've got the teams lining up for the start of the match.
[4783.10 - 4787.10] P:1921.41 E:0.096750 |  The two big decisions that were made by the coaches, Douay plays,
[4787.10 - 4791.10] P:1917.08 E:0.101254 |  and Barcalat is only among the substitutes for Paris Saint-Germain,
[4791.10 - 4798.10] P:1858.65 E:0.096446 |  and for Inter, Pavard is fit, important big player, a winning player,
[4798.10 - 4804.10] P:1916.53 E:0.092902 |  a World Cup winner in 2018, and indeed Pavard,
[4804.10 - 4809.10] P:1796.78 E:0.097056 |  a Champions League winner against PSG back in 2020,
[4809.10 - 4812.10] P:1738.20 E:0.104591 |  when he was playing for Bayern Munich, so he's in the team.
[4812.10 - 4816.10] P:1884.97 E:0.097720 |  So the PSG side, other than that, as expected, Donnarumma,
[4816.10 - 4819.10] P:1820.99 E:0.101658 |  Hakimi Marquinhos the captain, Pacho, Nuno Mendes,
[4819.10 - 4823.10] P:1792.79 E:0.099864 |  then that midfield of Vittini, Giornaves and Fabian Ruiz,
[4823.10 - 4827.10] P:1825.60 E:0.097031 |  and then up front, Usmann Dampellet, the 33-goal top scorer,
[4827.10 - 4832.10] P:1829.87 E:0.100193 |  with Desiree Douay and Caviccia Cavarra-Scalia either side of him.
[4832.10 - 4837.10] P:1805.48 E:0.094116 |  And Inter in their yellow shirts, Janss Summering goal, Pavard a chair-beat,
[4837.10 - 4840.10] P:1865.14 E:0.094210 |  and Bastoni the three central defenders,
[4840.10 - 4843.10] P:1875.21 E:0.094867 |  Dumfriesen DiMarco as the wing-backs, Cialonoglu Barella,
[4843.10 - 4847.10] P:1769.16 E:0.090899 |  and McIterian, who've hardly mentioned McIterian at 36,
[4848.10 - 4851.10] P:1727.07 E:0.092934 |  starting the Champions League final, and then Marcus Turan
[4851.10 - 4855.10] P:1852.44 E:0.085571 |  and the captain, Lautaro Martinez, up front.
[4855.10 - 4857.10] P:1946.45 E:0.084774 |  So here we go.
[4857.10 - 4862.10] P:1882.10 E:0.095562 |  The first Champions League final here in this great Bavarian city,
[4862.10 - 4867.10] P:1886.26 E:0.086300 |  since Chelsea won it back in 2012, PSG kickoff,
[4867.10 - 4871.10] P:1698.66 E:0.103513 |  and Vittini built it downfield out for a throw-in.
[4871.10 - 4873.10] P:1742.69 E:0.100470 |  It's incredible, isn't it?
[4873.10 - 4876.10] P:1752.80 E:0.097726 |  It's a bit like a rugby kick to touch.
[4876.10 - 4878.10] P:1688.42 E:0.088013 |  What on earth was that?
[4878.10 - 4880.10] P:1618.92 E:0.102384 |  I don't know whether I've seen that before.
[4880.10 - 4883.10] P:1837.22 E:0.104780 |  You expect something like that from maybe a Stokes City?
[4883.10 - 4887.10] P:1693.99 E:0.098301 |  I was just going to say Neil Warnock might have come up with something like that,
[4887.10 - 4889.10] P:1605.90 E:0.084366 |  with all due respect, Chris.
[4889.10 - 4891.10] P:1638.09 E:0.102498 |  So Chris Sutton's with us for the commentary,
[4891.10 - 4894.10] P:1676.86 E:0.104854 |  World Service listeners are with us as well on Five Live.
[4894.10 - 4896.10] P:1760.71 E:0.102485 |  Listeners, wherever you are tonight, BBC sounds,
[4896.10 - 4899.10] P:1586.20 E:0.101341 |  if you're on the move, you'll find all of your radio networks there,
[4899.10 - 4904.10] P:1646.52 E:0.091986 |  your BBC radio networks, and PSG, they are the home team tonight,
[4904.10 - 4908.10] P:1700.69 E:0.096766 |  so they're in the almost all navy blue kit with the red and white trim,
[4908.10 - 4910.10] P:1707.51 E:0.088707 |  that big stripe down the front of the blue shirt,
[4910.10 - 4912.10] P:1753.94 E:0.092469 |  and Dan Ballet with a first touch,
[4912.10 - 4915.10] P:1722.59 E:0.096116 |  but it bounces back two rams on the move, two rams through the middle.
[4915.10 - 4918.10] P:1748.96 E:0.106685 |  An important interception from Nuno Mendes.
[4918.10 - 4920.10] P:1777.92 E:0.097709 |  That was a little victory early on from the left back,
[4920.10 - 4922.10] P:1720.30 E:0.096977 |  and then on the half-wail line, Hakimi,
[4922.10 - 4926.10] P:1794.55 E:0.100504 |  the other fallback for Paris Saint-Germain, keeps the ball against De Marco.
[4926.10 - 4929.10] P:1910.27 E:0.106700 |  I think the truth is, John, we knew how PSG would start this game,
[4929.10 - 4931.10] P:1806.38 E:0.089154 |  they'll start on the front foot.
[4931.10 - 4934.10] P:1800.19 E:0.102626 |  I don't think anybody was quite sure about how Inter would start,
[4934.10 - 4937.10] P:1846.80 E:0.095311 |  but it looks like they'll pick their moments,
[4937.10 - 4941.10] P:1709.39 E:0.089159 |  went to press light, and then went to drop off.
[4941.10 - 4945.10] P:1696.62 E:0.093591 |  There was a lot of talk yesterday, when we were doing all of the talking,
[4945.10 - 4950.10] P:1665.42 E:0.092075 |  about how PSG would cope with the front two of Inter,
[4950.10 - 4954.10] P:1472.79 E:0.091712 |  Martinez and Turand, so that's definitely what you're watching.
[4954.10 - 4957.10] P:1552.26 E:0.085919 |  I mean, the two of them there together,
[4957.10 - 4961.10] P:1629.03 E:0.097769 |  they're less than 10 yards apart, the two frontmen.
[4961.10 - 4965.10] P:1827.31 E:0.099332 |  He plays that way, Simone Insagi likes the two up top,
[4965.10 - 4969.10] P:1827.88 E:0.095595 |  and it's of paramount importance that they do play close together,
[4969.10 - 4973.10] P:1752.80 E:0.088375 |  they don't get dragged apart, that becomes far more difficult for them.
[4973.10 - 4977.10] P:1744.27 E:0.093767 |  PSG nail Inter, nail Paris Saint-Germain,
[4977.10 - 4979.10] P:1856.08 E:0.087566 |  looking to create club history tonight,
[4979.10 - 4984.10] P:1702.85 E:0.090597 |  by winning the Champions League and lifting that European cup for the first time.
[4984.10 - 4987.10] P:1773.62 E:0.095206 |  And then, he's playing the ball towards the edge of the area,
[4987.10 - 4990.10] P:1734.44 E:0.105168 |  that's good, he has a little burralla, he's giving it away,
[4990.10 - 4993.10] P:1818.22 E:0.103963 |  Douay's onto this, the team edge, and out of the edge of the area,
[4993.10 - 4995.10] P:1790.92 E:0.092198 |  Challenge came in on him, Douay works it across,
[4995.10 - 4999.10] P:1743.47 E:0.099744 |  but the clearance was there, and one of the Inter players has gone down,
[4999.10 - 5001.10] P:2058.68 E:0.105555 |  and I think might have fallen awkwardly,
[5001.10 - 5004.10] P:2026.10 E:0.101261 |  as he tried to put in the challenge on the edge of the area,
[5004.10 - 5008.10] P:1962.19 E:0.093718 |  Chalinolu, who I thought I saw him twist his foot,
[5008.10 - 5011.10] P:1596.72 E:0.100053 |  in fact he's saying that he got a hand in the face from Douay.
[5011.10 - 5014.10] P:1742.92 E:0.100932 |  I should mention Chris, Romanian referee tonight,
[5014.10 - 5019.10] P:1628.30 E:0.095752 |  István Kovac, who tonight, and he's one of the most experienced, of course he is,
[5019.10 - 5022.10] P:1616.48 E:0.100232 |  he completes the set of the three European finals,
[5022.10 - 5025.10] P:1574.87 E:0.094140 |  he's won the conference league, he's won the Europa League,
[5025.10 - 5027.10] P:1544.63 E:0.071292 |  now he's got the Champions League.
[5027.10 - 5029.10] P:1620.49 E:0.112542 |  Just wondered, Douay got in the half-term,
[5029.10 - 5032.10] P:1861.15 E:0.093404 |  whether he could have actually slid the ball through to Dembele,
[5032.10 - 5037.10] P:1937.47 E:0.092551 |  took a touch or two, and it eventually crowded out.
[5038.10 - 5042.10] P:1613.86 E:0.078581 |  So, Free Kick was given to Inter,
[5042.10 - 5046.10] P:1563.12 E:0.091888 |  who strike it away downfield, and it comes back to the halfway line.
[5046.10 - 5051.10] P:1721.02 E:0.093092 |  And Pavard gets his first touch, having missed the last six matches back to Sommar,
[5051.10 - 5054.10] P:1874.33 E:0.093711 |  the Swiss goalkeeper got it on his left foot,
[5054.10 - 5057.10] P:1726.68 E:0.101573 |  but was put under pressure immediately by Dembele,
[5057.10 - 5061.10] P:1834.60 E:0.090497 |  and that's forced him to kick it straight out of play,
[5061.10 - 5065.10] P:1637.89 E:0.088137 |  for throwing to PSG halfway inside the Inter half.
[5065.10 - 5069.10] P:1659.65 E:0.097129 |  Inter themselves three times winners of this competition,
[5069.10 - 5072.10] P:1598.59 E:0.100850 |  but not since 2010 when José Mourinho's team won it,
[5072.10 - 5075.10] P:1627.35 E:0.091186 |  Diego Milito scored both goals,
[5075.10 - 5080.10] P:1653.70 E:0.095301 |  I saw so many Milito shirts today, trying to evoke that spirit,
[5080.10 - 5085.10] P:1582.68 E:0.089715 |  and of course Inter losing in the final two years ago,
[5085.10 - 5089.10] P:1560.24 E:0.091752 |  against Pep Guardiola and Ko in Istanbul.
[5089.10 - 5093.10] P:1745.53 E:0.093056 |  He has Viteña, PSG already dominating the possession.
[5093.10 - 5098.10] P:1709.07 E:0.091459 |  Inzaghi said that his team would be looking to get as much of the ball as possible,
[5098.10 - 5101.10] P:1697.64 E:0.085600 |  but this is the early pattern that we expected,
[5101.10 - 5104.10] P:1616.24 E:0.097914 |  as it's won back on the halfway line by Miqueterian,
[5104.10 - 5106.10] P:1644.22 E:0.102009 |  who has bundled over near the centre-circle,
[5106.10 - 5108.10] P:1844.56 E:0.085012 |  and that has given us a free kick.
[5108.10 - 5113.10] P:1753.85 E:0.088453 |  Yeah, really well organised, Inter sitting deep,
[5113.10 - 5117.10] P:1619.29 E:0.089065 |  that back five, and then when they do win the ball,
[5117.10 - 5119.10] P:1650.73 E:0.102855 |  an attack with Pace Miqueterian.
[5119.10 - 5121.10] P:1632.48 E:0.093878 |  It's interesting to see how long he lost,
[5121.10 - 5125.10] P:1558.76 E:0.087758 |  at the ripe old age of 36.
[5125.10 - 5128.10] P:1611.53 E:0.094593 |  Beautiful evening here, it's warm, dry,
[5128.10 - 5133.10] P:1565.59 E:0.095381 |  it has actually clouded over above the Allianz Arena.
[5133.10 - 5135.10] P:1756.13 E:0.110033 |  As the ball is played through the middle to Martinez,
[5135.10 - 5138.10] P:1626.09 E:0.095126 |  but he couldn't get that pass right, hit it short,
[5138.10 - 5140.10] P:1615.93 E:0.095649 |  and Hakimi was able to give it to Marquinhos,
[5140.10 - 5141.10] P:1508.15 E:0.093471 |  who knocks it back.
[5141.10 - 5143.10] P:1527.79 E:0.107235 |  Marquinhos, if they're able to do it tonight,
[5143.10 - 5146.10] P:1389.39 E:0.099947 |  would mean so much to him, he played in the final in Lisbon.
[5146.10 - 5149.10] P:1684.57 E:0.095398 |  As a midfielder, he started that match, Marquinhos,
[5149.10 - 5152.10] P:1512.22 E:0.103303 |  against Hansi Flakes by Mignan, that was Thomas Tuchels,
[5152.10 - 5154.10] P:1427.70 E:0.089798 |  Paris Saint-Germain, if you remember.
[5154.10 - 5156.10] P:1593.45 E:0.109859 |  Summer now with a ball on the edge of his box,
[5156.10 - 5158.10] P:1693.37 E:0.100118 |  long clearance downfield, but that drift straight out of play
[5158.10 - 5160.10] P:1711.55 E:0.096111 |  for a throw-in to PSG.
[5160.10 - 5162.10] P:1587.79 E:0.112189 |  They've certainly got into their stride,
[5162.10 - 5164.10] P:1538.25 E:0.105105 |  Luis Enriquez's team a long throw,
[5164.10 - 5166.10] P:1662.36 E:0.096187 |  he has Coralatz Kaelia,
[5166.10 - 5169.10] P:1676.56 E:0.099825 |  trying to get round the outside of Pavard,
[5169.10 - 5171.10] P:1806.82 E:0.104131 |  but he did his job, did it well,
[5171.10 - 5173.10] P:1708.10 E:0.096503 |  and then Inter win themselves,
[5173.10 - 5175.10] P:1629.22 E:0.112443 |  for throwing ten yards inside their own half.
[5175.10 - 5177.10] P:1781.61 E:0.085073 |  PSG fans to our left,
[5177.10 - 5180.10] P:1629.27 E:0.098332 |  that is the end that the French champions are defending
[5180.10 - 5183.10] P:1532.88 E:0.102694 |  in the first half, and they are doing their job.
[5183.10 - 5186.10] P:1543.23 E:0.096548 |  And at the other end, all of that blue and black,
[5186.10 - 5191.10] P:1553.33 E:0.097205 |  so much of it, with the odd white and yellow shirt
[5191.10 - 5193.10] P:1455.56 E:0.082930 |  spattered around in amongst it,
[5193.10 - 5196.10] P:1495.79 E:0.095588 |  but it is mainly the black and blue,
[5196.10 - 5201.10] P:1433.02 E:0.092538 |  il narraturi of internazionale.
[5201.10 - 5205.10] P:1716.55 E:0.091249 |  Here is Marquinhos, ten yards inside his own half,
[5205.10 - 5207.10] P:1870.33 E:0.102278 |  looks forward to his Fabian Ruiz,
[5207.10 - 5211.10] P:1547.24 E:0.093421 |  Fabian Ruiz, European championship winner with Spain now,
[5211.10 - 5215.10] P:1598.80 E:0.094617 |  attempting to become a European champion with his club.
[5215.10 - 5218.10] P:1624.62 E:0.099792 |  Fabian Ruiz, straight onto this again, plays it down the left,
[5218.10 - 5222.10] P:1668.40 E:0.096437 |  Dewey on the chase, Dewey, who has got company there with him,
[5222.10 - 5226.10] P:1867.70 E:0.104698 |  and he's handed off the ball by Bastoni,
[5226.10 - 5230.10] P:1848.96 E:0.097654 |  and Dewey was pushed off the pitch altogether,
[5230.10 - 5234.10] P:1716.99 E:0.100808 |  and it is given as a free kick, which was hotly disputed by Inter.
[5234.10 - 5237.10] P:1730.65 E:0.108098 |  Yeah, Bastoni, I mean, it's a little large, isn't it?
[5237.10 - 5240.10] P:1634.92 E:0.107385 |  I don't think Bastoni really wants to get drawn out
[5240.10 - 5242.10] P:1697.51 E:0.109569 |  in those wide areas up against Dewey.
[5242.10 - 5244.10] P:1635.34 E:0.089019 |  I think Dewey may have the beating of him,
[5244.10 - 5247.10] P:1766.84 E:0.092584 |  it's important they double up, and Dewey...
[5247.10 - 5250.10] P:1750.41 E:0.090607 |  Yeah, I mean, he shoved, but it's one of those
[5250.10 - 5253.10] P:1722.54 E:0.103626 |  where I think Dewey's made a bit of a meal of it,
[5253.10 - 5255.10] P:1562.29 E:0.099493 |  an opportunity from a wide free kick.
[5255.10 - 5259.10] P:1820.02 E:0.093598 |  Now, remember, Inter have scored eleven of their 26 Champions League goals,
[5259.10 - 5262.10] P:1739.62 E:0.091153 |  this season from set pieces.
[5262.10 - 5268.10] P:1652.46 E:0.087661 |  So here it is then defending a set piece as Vettinias strikes it in
[5268.10 - 5271.10] P:1588.96 E:0.099463 |  towards the back post, it's whipped right across everyone,
[5271.10 - 5273.10] P:1738.61 E:0.085381 |  taken down at the back post.
[5273.10 - 5277.10] P:1652.11 E:0.091001 |  Here's the cross in, off the head, it bounces to Vettinias again at the back post.
[5277.10 - 5280.10] P:1793.67 E:0.097765 |  He chips it in there, a stretch from Marquinhos,
[5280.10 - 5286.10] P:1824.40 E:0.093366 |  who goes to ground and off his head, bounces behind for a goal kick to Inter,
[5286.10 - 5288.10] P:1572.24 E:0.106804 |  and it remains 0-0.
[5288.10 - 5290.10] P:1761.75 E:0.086221 |  I think Pavard does brilliantly.
[5290.10 - 5293.10] P:1599.60 E:0.097017 |  They're at the back post four in Jersey,
[5293.10 - 5297.10] P:1653.33 E:0.096211 |  they play the way out, they play the way out successfully at the moment.
[5297.10 - 5300.10] P:1598.41 E:0.097318 |  PSG are not letting up with their press.
[5300.10 - 5303.10] P:1578.39 E:0.102102 |  They are not, they are really putting Inter under pressure.
[5303.10 - 5305.10] P:1676.58 E:0.098661 |  But eventually they work into DeMarco,
[5305.10 - 5310.10] P:1779.70 E:0.104754 |  but DeMarco gives it away, cheers, French cheers, Vettinias now 30 yards out,
[5310.10 - 5312.10] P:1732.39 E:0.100633 |  takes it on a little further, puts his foot on the ball,
[5312.10 - 5315.10] P:1543.78 E:0.088855 |  then to the edge of the box, then it comes back to Fabian Ruiz,
[5315.10 - 5319.10] P:1704.58 E:0.101794 |  Fabian Ruiz out to the right-hand side, little João Neves is there,
[5319.10 - 5323.10] P:1563.81 E:0.097355 |  the Portuguese with the curly black hair, back in towards another Portuguese,
[5323.10 - 5328.10] P:1520.49 E:0.099285 |  Vettinias, they'll be here again on Wednesday night with Roberto Martinez,
[5328.10 - 5332.10] P:1769.15 E:0.093692 |  the Portuguese coach, they come here to play in the Nations League against Germany.
[5332.10 - 5335.10] P:1649.12 E:0.108860 |  Roberto Martinez is here this evening, Roy Hodgson as well,
[5335.10 - 5338.10] P:1581.52 E:0.087595 |  the former England manager, but the former Inter manager,
[5338.10 - 5341.10] P:1627.07 E:0.099264 |  as part of the UEFA technical committee,
[5341.10 - 5344.10] P:1695.45 E:0.084425 |  we saw him on the pitch before the game, Vettinias,
[5344.10 - 5348.10] P:1619.35 E:0.091796 |  15 yards inside Inter territory, back to the right-hand side,
[5348.10 - 5350.10] P:1616.25 E:0.106606 |  they are putting some pressure on Inter here,
[5350.10 - 5354.10] P:1577.08 E:0.097279 |  step over, step over from Douay, then it's delivered to Dan Belly on the edge of the area,
[5354.10 - 5357.10] P:1591.93 E:0.091008 |  back to Vettinias, Vettinias thinks about the shot,
[5357.10 - 5361.10] P:1584.59 E:0.095004 |  but there are too many Inter players between him and the edge of the penalty area,
[5361.10 - 5365.10] P:1594.96 E:0.095748 |  so PSG go back to the edge of the, back towards the half-way line,
[5365.10 - 5368.10] P:1727.86 E:0.100951 |  Nuno Mendes then out to the right-hand side, Fabian Ruiz in,
[5368.10 - 5371.10] P:1786.56 E:0.093435 |  Hakimi tries to cross it, but it's blocked by the defender DeMarco,
[5371.10 - 5373.10] P:1725.91 E:0.093875 |  who is able to turn, see the ball in front of him,
[5373.10 - 5378.10] P:1648.09 E:0.100833 |  and whacks it away to the half-way line, but PSG back in possession again,
[5378.10 - 5381.10] P:1736.59 E:0.102174 |  that looked like a foul on Vettinias, referee waves the advantage,
[5381.10 - 5385.10] P:1688.44 E:0.108460 |  Fabian Ruiz, more encouragement for the PSG supporters,
[5385.10 - 5389.10] P:1774.56 E:0.087464 |  as the tall Spanish midfielder Fabian Ruiz is able to keep possession,
[5389.10 - 5393.10] P:1714.67 E:0.097152 |  just gliding in from the right-hand side, now it's the Moroccan international,
[5393.10 - 5399.10] P:1620.33 E:0.101136 |  Hakimi, the former Inter man, had one season at Inter, then in field,
[5399.10 - 5404.10] P:1714.10 E:0.099143 |  Vettinias, Nuno Mendes picks out the ball towards the edge of the box,
[5404.10 - 5409.10] P:1873.16 E:0.098933 |  and the shot from the angle from Douay, who popped up there towards the left corner of the box,
[5409.10 - 5413.10] P:1811.30 E:0.087325 |  is straight at Summer, who's able to gather it into his yellow shirt.
[5413.10 - 5418.10] P:1561.31 E:0.097366 |  Yeah, it's a good switch of play from PSG, you can play that way against it,
[5418.10 - 5421.10] P:1695.88 E:0.110456 |  3-5-2, quick switches of play, get a bit of dominance,
[5421.10 - 5424.10] P:1591.11 E:0.099489 |  overloads in those wide areas.
[5424.10 - 5428.10] P:1638.54 E:0.100659 |  This is, it's been intense that pressure hasn't it, and Inter just can't get out,
[5428.10 - 5433.10] P:1595.68 E:0.098788 |  although here they are with Turan, Turan, Martinez, Latorra, Martinez,
[5433.10 - 5437.10] P:1738.38 E:0.097469 |  to the right-hand side, to Dumfries, Barales ball across the penalty area,
[5437.10 - 5440.10] P:1619.26 E:0.090083 |  is headed down at the back post, safely by Droneves,
[5440.10 - 5444.10] P:1558.09 E:0.097204 |  who's kind of dropped in at right back while Hakimi is further forward,
[5444.10 - 5449.10] P:1682.45 E:0.094406 |  and then it's played back to Donoroma, who might be getting his first touch first.
[5449.10 - 5454.10] P:1714.55 E:0.095341 |  The thing is within, John, I don't think they care whether they suffer a little bit,
[5454.10 - 5458.10] P:1706.94 E:0.086578 |  as you know, I think they actually quite enjoy suffering at times,
[5458.10 - 5462.10] P:1782.10 E:0.093941 |  as long as they get a favourable result, they'll hang on in there,
[5462.10 - 5465.10] P:1649.18 E:0.092300 |  they'll defend deep at times, they'll chuck the bodies on the line,
[5465.10 - 5470.10] P:1672.12 E:0.093521 |  they'll be resilient, but they'll have their moments in this game, I'm sure of that.
[5470.10 - 5477.10] P:1600.88 E:0.082184 |  Yeah, and you know, it's part of the fabric of Inter defending.
[5477.10 - 5483.10] P:1724.97 E:0.095139 |  Long has been, decades and decades, back to when they first won this competition,
[5483.10 - 5489.10] P:1660.87 E:0.096421 |  back in the mid-60s, under the great Heleneo Herrera,
[5489.10 - 5496.10] P:1662.15 E:0.095530 |  who was very much part of the Italian catinaccio brigade,
[5496.10 - 5500.10] P:1722.43 E:0.090788 |  the Dorbolt defending, so that's where it came from.
[5500.10 - 5504.10] P:1756.70 E:0.097605 |  And here we are, 2024-25, what happened in the group stage,
[5504.10 - 5508.10] P:1727.70 E:0.095416 |  in Zargi's Inter conceded one goal in the group stage.
[5508.10 - 5511.10] P:1784.85 E:0.095222 |  But here comes Dan Bale, cutting in from the right,
[5511.10 - 5515.10] P:1811.94 E:0.098144 |  and then the left-foot shot was weak, and it was straight at goalkeeper Summer,
[5515.10 - 5517.10] P:1781.54 E:0.096623 |  who was able to see it bounce up into his chest.
[5517.10 - 5521.10] P:1789.10 E:0.103264 |  And that's your central striker, PSG, drifting out into that wide right area.
[5521.10 - 5524.10] P:1738.80 E:0.092213 |  I actually think it's a tame effort, Summer gathers easily,
[5524.10 - 5528.10] P:1829.98 E:0.093004 |  but has a decent shooting opportunity for Dan Bale,
[5528.10 - 5531.10] P:1709.76 E:0.091439 |  in off that right-hand side, on his left foot.
[5531.10 - 5536.10] P:1733.00 E:0.089925 |  That was given away by McIterian in the centre area, so PSG have got it again.
[5536.10 - 5540.10] P:1780.82 E:0.104377 |  Nil Nel, if you've just joined us five live from the BBC and the World Service as well,
[5540.10 - 5544.10] P:1662.02 E:0.094426 |  here is the excellent Coralitz Kalea on the left-hand side.
[5544.10 - 5547.10] P:1561.64 E:0.087827 |  Fabian Ruiz has popped up there, back to Virginia, back into the box.
[5547.10 - 5551.10] P:1624.53 E:0.111615 |  Do it with a check, squares it, there it is, in the middle.
[5551.10 - 5557.10] P:1566.42 E:0.114531 |  Hakini makes it 1-0 Paris Saint-Germain, it's the right back, they love that.
[5557.10 - 5562.10] P:1595.78 E:0.112725 |  They love their goal-scoring right backs, and he's there on the edge of the six-yard area
[5562.10 - 5566.10] P:1555.27 E:0.114536 |  to give PSG the lead in the 12th minute.
[5566.10 - 5571.10] P:1684.86 E:0.111455 |  Brilliantly worked, slick football, just exactly what we expect
[5571.10 - 5576.10] P:1652.32 E:0.109256 |  from Luis Enriquez Paris Saint-Germain, total football.
[5576.10 - 5581.10] P:1563.29 E:0.108548 |  What a start to the game from PSG, they thoroughly deserve it.
[5581.10 - 5586.10] P:1380.74 E:0.106370 |  They've been the dominant team, they've pushed into back,
[5586.10 - 5589.10] P:1481.07 E:0.111901 |  and they work it brilliantly, clever little ball,
[5589.10 - 5595.10] P:1566.65 E:0.102180 |  and the half turn, and Hakini, all of six yards out, I think it's Dewey on the drift.
[5595.10 - 5598.10] P:1511.49 E:0.086021 |  And it's a great pick.
[5599.10 - 5602.10] P:1551.11 E:0.110301 |  Left-hand side of the box, and he gets his head up,
[5602.10 - 5606.10] P:1614.45 E:0.099578 |  I wonder whether he thought about shooting, he didn't, he was unselfish,
[5606.10 - 5611.10] P:1734.69 E:0.105148 |  and picks out Hakini, who's as free as a bird, six-seven yards out, centre of the goal,
[5611.10 - 5615.10] P:1735.87 E:0.095838 |  and he just side-foot the ball in easily.
[5615.10 - 5617.10] P:1763.50 E:0.099948 |  What a start for PSG.
[5617.10 - 5622.10] P:1619.48 E:0.098714 |  Paris Saint-Germain won, inter-nil.
[5622.10 - 5625.10] P:1875.72 E:0.098046 |  A storming start from the French champions,
[5625.10 - 5628.10] P:1708.83 E:0.098714 |  and they've got the early goal that they were looking for.
[5628.10 - 5632.10] P:1683.38 E:0.096686 |  And it is remarkable, isn't it, how these full-backs,
[5632.10 - 5636.10] P:1632.78 E:0.103127 |  whether it's Nuno Mendes on one side, we've not really seen him come forward,
[5636.10 - 5641.10] P:1486.09 E:0.104355 |  or whether it's Hakini as it is in this case, that's his ninth goal of the season,
[5641.10 - 5645.10] P:1533.91 E:0.105666 |  he's provided the assist for so many as well,
[5645.10 - 5651.10] P:1471.18 E:0.104671 |  and Hakini, who scored in the French Cup final last weekend,
[5651.10 - 5655.10] P:1516.90 E:0.100737 |  effectively clinched it, scored in the second leg against Arsenal,
[5655.10 - 5660.10] P:1620.24 E:0.102695 |  scored against Aston Villa, and now he's scored in the Champions League final.
[5660.10 - 5663.10] P:1424.85 E:0.095749 |  Right back in name only, really, is it?
[5663.10 - 5665.10] P:1625.26 E:0.110776 |  You know, he plays all up that right-hand side, doesn't he?
[5665.10 - 5670.10] P:1603.34 E:0.091539 |  Right back, right winger inside right, took up a brilliant position in the box,
[5670.10 - 5677.10] P:1697.83 E:0.091945 |  he was unmarked, but also the way in this opening period that PSG have interchanged,
[5677.10 - 5680.10] P:1762.75 E:0.100125 |  and players on the drift do it a couple of times,
[5680.10 - 5684.10] P:1693.79 E:0.083565 |  just drifted over to that left-hand side, very hard to mark,
[5684.10 - 5688.10] P:1542.54 E:0.078829 |  and that was the key, he was found free,
[5688.10 - 5694.10] P:1524.23 E:0.107526 |  just squared to Hakini, one up, and Inter, talked about Inter's experience,
[5694.10 - 5698.10] P:1538.19 E:0.104044 |  they're going to have to use every ounce of it to get back in this game,
[5698.10 - 5703.10] P:1481.61 E:0.104167 |  because they are a team who are being dominated, cannot get up the pitch.
[5704.10 - 5707.10] P:1473.83 E:0.112219 |  And how tough is that for the Inter supporters?
[5707.10 - 5714.10] P:1445.46 E:0.098077 |  At that end, one of their own played for Inter for one season, won the league under Conte,
[5714.10 - 5718.10] P:1597.79 E:0.114698 |  and there he was on the edge, as you said, Chris, free as a bird,
[5718.10 - 5721.10] P:1548.28 E:0.096773 |  and it is the year of the bird, as we keep being told,
[5721.10 - 5725.10] P:1642.18 E:0.094193 |  to pop it in on the edge of the box, and I mean, they had their pickets pocked,
[5725.10 - 5731.10] P:1533.63 E:0.094388 |  their pockets picked, if I can spit it out there by PSG,
[5731.10 - 5735.10] P:1598.31 E:0.100284 |  as you say, inside left, outside right, they didn't know where he was,
[5735.10 - 5738.10] P:1775.92 E:0.087203 |  he was free as can be, and popped it in the net.
[5738.10 - 5744.10] P:1630.11 E:0.094883 |  Yep, and it has been a feature of PSG, the longer the season has gone on,
[5744.10 - 5749.10] P:1498.20 E:0.091354 |  the confidence has been there in forward areas, well, not just in forward areas,
[5749.10 - 5752.10] P:1545.22 E:0.078372 |  all over the pitch, and they just back themselves,
[5752.10 - 5756.10] P:1730.47 E:0.096905 |  they think their build-up play is going to be better than the opposition's,
[5757.10 - 5761.10] P:1479.36 E:0.084184 |  and in every area, they have great strength,
[5761.10 - 5765.10] P:1701.38 E:0.096918 |  and they talked before the game about, do I, John, would he start?
[5767.10 - 5769.10] P:1432.53 E:0.095962 |  And how effective has he been?
[5769.10 - 5773.10] P:1593.35 E:0.106128 |  And he set up the goal, Vettini's pass was the...
[5773.10 - 5777.10] P:1595.72 E:0.097678 |  That was the scalpel's touch, wasn't it, from Vettini on the edge of the area,
[5777.10 - 5782.10] P:1605.81 E:0.093532 |  who played it through perfectly for Douay, who just squared it for Akimi,
[5782.10 - 5789.10] P:1484.48 E:0.096930 |  and now PSG won into Nill, they didn't score in the final, back in 2020,
[5789.10 - 5793.10] P:1542.99 E:0.091727 |  they were beaten by one of their own, if you remember then,
[5793.10 - 5800.10] P:1535.84 E:0.089158 |  Kingsley Coleman, the Paris boy who scored the winner for Bayern Munich,
[5800.10 - 5806.10] P:1643.88 E:0.093320 |  but here it's different, and it is Lewis Enriquez's team who are in front,
[5806.10 - 5809.10] P:1838.05 E:0.085600 |  as he attempts to win it for the third,
[5809.10 - 5813.10] P:1650.74 E:0.101903 |  and the second time as a coach after his Barcelona days 10 years ago,
[5813.10 - 5817.10] P:1630.93 E:0.097224 |  but he's built this team, even though this is still only a second season,
[5817.10 - 5824.10] P:1689.19 E:0.093612 |  this PSG team has got the thumbprint of Lewis Enriquez all over it,
[5824.10 - 5830.10] P:1497.84 E:0.097860 |  and part of that is doing exactly what they've done in the opening 15 minutes of this match,
[5830.10 - 5835.10] P:1614.14 E:0.094484 |  but in turn out, having to respond, they've barely been behind in the Champions League this season,
[5835.10 - 5839.10] P:1467.37 E:0.098147 |  I think in total it's something like 17 minutes before tonight,
[5839.10 - 5841.10] P:1526.14 E:0.096500 |  that Inter have been behind in this whole competition.
[5841.10 - 5845.10] P:1618.58 E:0.087533 |  That is incredible, and in this opening 16 minutes,
[5845.10 - 5847.10] P:1637.47 E:0.092419 |  Inter haven't been able to get up the pitch,
[5847.10 - 5849.10] P:1742.92 E:0.092653 |  we've talked about the importance of the centre forwards,
[5849.10 - 5852.10] P:1623.88 E:0.094289 |  linking up there for the first time, long ball into Ram,
[5852.10 - 5857.10] P:1732.32 E:0.092469 |  and Martinez drawing the foul, it's really important they do that.
[5857.10 - 5860.10] P:1767.58 E:0.092097 |  To Ram now, forcing it forward, Dumfries on the chase,
[5860.10 - 5864.10] P:1600.79 E:0.106539 |  William Pacho is back there, Cavarrochalier is back there as well,
[5864.10 - 5868.10] P:1768.43 E:0.091526 |  and that is typical of the work that Cavarrochalier does,
[5868.10 - 5872.10] P:1668.82 E:0.091372 |  he's effectively an auxiliary defender there as Inter broke forward,
[5872.10 - 5874.10] P:1731.47 E:0.092651 |  and now it's all the way back with Summer,
[5874.10 - 5878.10] P:1681.45 E:0.096168 |  at the other end who had to be quick there, under pressure from Dempale,
[5878.10 - 5881.10] P:1636.45 E:0.101389 |  but he was, he just got a tour to it to give it to Marco,
[5881.10 - 5885.10] P:1759.58 E:0.098921 |  that forces the error, and now Nuno Mendes,
[5885.10 - 5888.10] P:1787.98 E:0.104481 |  he has Cavarrochalier, right foot shot,
[5888.10 - 5891.10] P:1833.79 E:0.096625 |  he's blazed that, got right underneath it and blazed it,
[5891.10 - 5894.10] P:1839.03 E:0.106879 |  high across the face of Golan, beyond the far top corner,
[5894.10 - 5897.10] P:1697.45 E:0.109306 |  and into the Inter fans, 1-0 PSG lead.
[5897.10 - 5900.10] P:1489.35 E:0.082355 |  Yeah, and so dominant, and Moritz Scalier,
[5900.10 - 5904.10] P:1621.75 E:0.107313 |  you expect better from him, coming inside on that right foot,
[5904.10 - 5906.10] P:1575.61 E:0.111637 |  he's always going to try and come in on that right foot,
[5906.10 - 5909.10] P:1547.54 E:0.105076 |  and get a shot off, Pavard backed off,
[5909.10 - 5914.10] P:1626.88 E:0.089419 |  the shot was high and wide, but it is total dominance, John,
[5914.10 - 5916.10] P:1460.44 E:0.095435 |  he's opening stages.
[5918.10 - 5922.10] P:1552.97 E:0.101297 |  So 1-0 to PSG, 5-0 from the BBC, Inter coming forward,
[5922.10 - 5925.10] P:1784.58 E:0.095237 |  but Marquinhos was there, the force of thought,
[5925.10 - 5929.10] P:1870.73 E:0.101489 |  and the play will be stopped, because Nuno Mendes has gone down,
[5929.10 - 5934.10] P:1697.34 E:0.091412 |  holding the left side of his head, so they will have a look at him.
[5934.10 - 5938.10] P:1565.71 E:0.084328 |  So what a start we've had then, it's a start that matched the build-up,
[5938.10 - 5941.10] P:1729.01 E:0.080319 |  actually, all action, wham, bam,
[5941.10 - 5945.10] P:1495.74 E:0.085173 |  and that goal beautifully worked by the team,
[5945.10 - 5948.10] P:1533.47 E:0.085907 |  and you're in Douay, and then finished off by Hakimi.
[5948.10 - 5951.10] P:1645.19 E:0.101667 |  So we've got a choice of listening for you right now,
[5951.10 - 5956.10] P:1612.53 E:0.095007 |  on the brand new Sport Extra 2, you will hear the T20 blast,
[5956.10 - 5960.10] P:1488.36 E:0.092741 |  Sport Extra 3, the Super League Catalan against Hall,
[5960.10 - 5963.10] P:1635.02 E:0.089957 |  will either have just finished, or it'll be coming to an end,
[5963.10 - 5967.10] P:1639.86 E:0.093367 |  we'll get you a scoreline on that in due course,
[5967.10 - 5970.10] P:1556.67 E:0.104221 |  but brand new BBC sounds, that's where you find them,
[5970.10 - 5972.10] P:1568.67 E:0.103605 |  at the top of the dial on BBC sounds,
[5972.10 - 5975.10] P:1593.03 E:0.094778 |  Sport Extra 2 and 3, which means that we can bring you
[5975.10 - 5982.10] P:1679.79 E:0.096588 |  more and more and more live sport, as the players back underway,
[5982.10 - 5984.10] P:1540.59 E:0.090752 |  and Nuno Mendes just keeping an eye on him,
[5984.10 - 5988.10] P:1343.54 E:0.093600 |  having received that bang on the head, seems okay, back up on his feet,
[5988.10 - 5992.10] P:1425.73 E:0.091911 |  and I think probably everybody needed a breather after the start for this match,
[5992.10 - 5996.10] P:1639.27 E:0.097753 |  and smoke bellowing out as it seems, every area,
[5996.10 - 6000.10] P:1795.70 E:0.097297 |  I mean it's all coming from the left, that's where the PSG flares have been,
[6000.10 - 6005.10] P:1663.76 E:0.097539 |  and those smoke sticks, but all is quiet now, all of the red has disappeared,
[6005.10 - 6011.10] P:1793.12 E:0.093301 |  but I mean it's hanging around, it's like a mist, it's like a London piece super.
[6011.10 - 6017.10] P:1956.28 E:0.103613 |  Catalan's nil, Hall FC 34 is the final score,
[6017.10 - 6020.10] P:1982.90 E:0.107788 |  and we'll keep you up to date as well with Milvac Djokovic,
[6020.10 - 6023.10] P:1956.69 E:0.095289 |  who's playing right now at the French Open,
[6023.10 - 6031.10] P:1993.42 E:0.101583 |  and was up early in that match, throwing level with the edge of the penalty area.
[6031.10 - 6035.10] P:1929.47 E:0.105545 |  Don't freeze to take this, a long loopy throw, that's headed on by Toulon,
[6035.10 - 6040.10] P:1664.23 E:0.105656 |  headed across the box by William Pacho, and it was kept in over there on the far side,
[6040.10 - 6045.10] P:1670.33 E:0.103331 |  but Gaurd's Kehler is away with it, and the Georgian passes it forward to D'Ambele,
[6045.10 - 6049.10] P:1692.74 E:0.101858 |  Fabian Ruiz is through the middle, still going with it, D'Ambele,
[6049.10 - 6052.10] P:1803.49 E:0.096519 |  Shroud Nevers arriving, all the way across to the right,
[6052.10 - 6057.10] P:1558.39 E:0.117313 |  doing with a shot to Flake De Nain, pass to him, it's 2-0,
[6057.10 - 6064.10] P:1599.68 E:0.114586 |  DSG are off like a shot in this Champions League final.
[6064.10 - 6069.10] P:1575.13 E:0.119456 |  Luis Enrique in his coaches all celebrate, nothing someone could do about that.
[6069.10 - 6075.10] P:1626.22 E:0.112166 |  First Akimi, now the teenager, Douay, what a choice that is from Luis Enrique,
[6075.10 - 6081.10] P:1507.77 E:0.113038 |  he set one up and he scored the other, the 19 year old, DSG 2 in 10-0.
[6081.10 - 6087.10] P:1418.92 E:0.107370 |  The right pick, of course it was the right pick, and it's from one end to the other,
[6087.10 - 6093.10] P:1416.34 E:0.101900 |  into, actually with the long throw, it looked like it was going to go out for a corner.
[6093.10 - 6098.10] P:1560.28 E:0.104314 |  I think it's Pacho who keeps the ball in, and then they break,
[6098.10 - 6103.10] P:1415.63 E:0.101304 |  the Brad Scaliere feeds the ball in the left hand channel,
[6103.10 - 6107.10] P:1633.25 E:0.105030 |  and D'Ambele does brilliantly, quick switcher play to Douay,
[6107.10 - 6110.10] P:1626.30 E:0.096486 |  right hand side of the box, takes the ball down,
[6110.10 - 6116.10] P:1674.14 E:0.084408 |  off his chest, one bounce and bang, and it's the deflection which does for Summer,
[6116.10 - 6121.10] P:1579.69 E:0.095176 |  who goes down to his right hand side, and the ball creeps past him,
[6121.10 - 6127.10] P:1566.05 E:0.086984 |  he chokes it into the floor, it's off to Marco, actually, the deflection,
[6127.10 - 6133.10] P:1516.44 E:0.101532 |  and PSG are blowing into Douay, Inter can't get a foothold in this game,
[6133.10 - 6137.10] P:1572.22 E:0.110420 |  we talk about them being resilient, bliming, they're going to have to be now,
[6137.10 - 6141.10] P:1439.23 E:0.097435 |  they're going to have to dig in and try and find a way back in this game,
[6141.10 - 6148.10] P:1512.77 E:0.100625 |  but it's impossible to see at this moment in time, they have been absolutely smothered, blown away.
[6148.10 - 6154.10] P:1457.36 E:0.101145 |  Yep, and now the flares are out again, 3, 4, 6, 8 of them,
[6154.10 - 6161.10] P:1582.81 E:0.091253 |  all being lit all of the time, I suspect somebody is making some sort of vain announcement
[6161.10 - 6166.10] P:1654.19 E:0.095497 |  to suggest that maybe they took them out, not sure how successful that's going to be,
[6166.10 - 6170.10] P:1629.49 E:0.090545 |  as Akiti plays the ball, high across his own penalty area,
[6170.10 - 6175.10] P:1635.48 E:0.087503 |  don't know Roma, tried to kick it away, got that all wrong,
[6175.10 - 6180.10] P:1802.22 E:0.097314 |  and now Inter with Dumfries with the cross that comes off Nuno Mendes
[6180.10 - 6184.10] P:1841.86 E:0.087579 |  is left behind for the first corner of the match, it's gone to Inter,
[6184.10 - 6189.10] P:1740.30 E:0.092030 |  more importantly, two goals have gone to PSG, but a corner to Inter.
[6189.10 - 6193.10] P:1798.95 E:0.095921 |  And Julian LeRond talking before the game about his worry,
[6193.10 - 6198.10] P:1958.13 E:0.095118 |  that this PSG team from set plays.
[6198.10 - 6205.10] P:1936.48 E:0.105273 |  Yep, so let's see how PSG deal with it, here comes the corner which is headed up,
[6205.10 - 6210.10] P:1681.44 E:0.093500 |  and all back from the edge of the six yard box, I think it was a chirpy,
[6210.10 - 6216.10] P:1818.82 E:0.096358 |  it was a chirpy who got there, the grizzled a chirpy with his scraggie beard,
[6216.10 - 6221.10] P:1772.40 E:0.094223 |  got higher than anyone else but couldn't keep the ball down, not this time a chirpy.
[6221.10 - 6227.10] P:1643.55 E:0.077233 |  It just couldn't get up high enough, it's seven yards out, centre of the goal,
[6227.10 - 6234.10] P:1559.48 E:0.082792 |  couldn't get over the ball and not it down, and don't know Roma, grateful that that crept over the bar.
[6235.10 - 6244.10] P:1472.58 E:0.079475 |  Paris Saint-Germain to Inter, Nile, goal kick to the French champions,
[6244.10 - 6249.10] P:1519.73 E:0.091193 |  winning it again this season for a record extending 13th time,
[6249.10 - 6257.10] P:1431.35 E:0.103184 |  the ball runs back into the Inter, penalty area, Inter who were pipped by Antonio Conte
[6257.10 - 6263.10] P:1314.27 E:0.107002 |  and Napoli and Scott McTominay and Billy Gilmour,
[6263.10 - 6268.10] P:1512.17 E:0.112856 |  and here they are trying to salvage something from this regular season,
[6268.10 - 6273.10] P:1507.76 E:0.111774 |  if you want to call it that, before both of these teams go off next month to America
[6273.10 - 6277.10] P:1446.97 E:0.103177 |  to the newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup,
[6277.10 - 6283.10] P:1482.61 E:0.104295 |  that they were beaten in the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia,
[6283.10 - 6289.10] P:1416.74 E:0.101832 |  they lost in the final of the Italian Super Cup as well which was played in Saudi Arabia,
[6289.10 - 6294.10] P:1437.86 E:0.095756 |  and here they are now having reached the final of the Champions League, two-nil down,
[6294.10 - 6298.10] P:1679.95 E:0.092944 |  I suppose the only thing it's able to say to them Chris is that there is actually still plenty of time to respond,
[6298.10 - 6302.10] P:1565.12 E:0.095410 |  but against this PSG team in the mood that they're in.
[6302.10 - 6310.10] P:1772.43 E:0.085213 |  Yeah, and you can't see PSG not creating more opportunities with the firepower that they have,
[6310.10 - 6316.10] P:1716.14 E:0.090097 |  but they haven't got any sort of foothold in this game, they've had absolutely no control,
[6316.10 - 6319.10] P:1822.28 E:0.085969 |  it's just one-way traffic isn't it?
[6319.10 - 6323.10] P:1767.29 E:0.102489 |  I thought it was interesting yesterday and I wasn't quite sure how this was going to work,
[6323.10 - 6329.10] P:1822.41 E:0.098164 |  as the man who opened the scoring, Hakimi, brings it forward and he gives it to the man who scored the second,
[6329.10 - 6337.10] P:1641.74 E:0.098773 |  he is absolutely loving this, the 19-year-old on the stage like this, dragging his foot over the ball,
[6337.10 - 6343.10] P:1495.04 E:0.095252 |  dragging it back, taking on players, probably watched LaMigna Mal in the semi-final,
[6343.10 - 6349.10] P:1684.41 E:0.096887 |  saw what he did against Inter and thought, a fancier bit of that, and here he is doing it,
[6349.10 - 6357.10] P:1633.11 E:0.093033 |  Duet, doing it, Latina back to the centre-circle to Jr. Neves who plays it back to William Pattschel.
[6357.10 - 6362.10] P:1635.06 E:0.098226 |  So things looking good, excellent start for Luis Enrique and Paris Saint-Germain, long pass forward,
[6362.10 - 6369.10] P:1578.24 E:0.096346 |  but some has got that, and Simone Insargi has got a lot of thinking to do.
[6369.10 - 6375.10] P:1592.67 E:0.099813 |  What he doesn't want is for this to get any worse, he's standing there almost doing that in front of our eyes
[6375.10 - 6380.10] P:1623.22 E:0.094559 |  with his hand on his chin, very thoughtful in his smart, slim-fitting black suit,
[6380.10 - 6386.10] P:1741.90 E:0.093522 |  Vettini, carrying it on through the middle, now here is Dembele, he's not got in on the act just yet,
[6386.10 - 6393.10] P:1763.77 E:0.091718 |  that's a worry as well, Hakimi back to Dembele, just one goal in his last-date appearance,
[6393.10 - 6396.10] P:1760.46 E:0.098803 |  as Maintier, which to me means he's due one way.
[6396.10 - 6403.10] P:1641.74 E:0.089491 |  Yeah, that's why I look at it as well, PSG have been so much in control and dominant.
[6403.10 - 6409.10] P:1600.85 E:0.102609 |  The thing is the way that PSG set up when Inter have the ball, they're happy to leave their centre-halves 2v2,
[6409.10 - 6416.10] P:1490.13 E:0.100112 |  Patrao Marquinhos with Toro Martinez and Turram, we can deal with those two,
[6416.10 - 6422.10] P:1532.67 E:0.088484 |  push Hakimi in high on Demarco, on the other side Mendes high,
[6422.10 - 6429.10] P:1681.40 E:0.097891 |  and then Zaldamp Fries, and just say, well, you know, we back ourselves to press you in her own half,
[6429.10 - 6431.10] P:1796.44 E:0.093515 |  you'll build up play, you can't play through us.
[6431.10 - 6436.10] P:1704.35 E:0.096329 |  No, and they can't get the ball off them, PSG dominate in the football.
[6436.10 - 6441.10] P:1689.67 E:0.097541 |  Out it comes to Hakimi again on the right-hand side, up against Demarco, the unfortunate Demarco.
[6441.10 - 6446.10] P:1838.48 E:0.107312 |  And Fabio Nouruis tries a shot from the edge of the area, but we were right behind that,
[6446.10 - 6453.10] P:1421.11 E:0.097939 |  as Jimmy Armfield used to say, and it was easily gobbled up in inverted terms, not literally, by Summer.
[6453.10 - 6461.10] P:1531.16 E:0.097243 |  Yeah, an easy gather, bit of a lazy attempt from Nouruis, there we go, there's that ball forward.
[6461.10 - 6464.10] P:1663.48 E:0.095067 |  Up to Turram, Big Turram, on the half-way line,
[6464.10 - 6468.10] P:1632.90 E:0.093324 |  and then holds it up against William Pacho, the Ecuadorian, I don't know about you,
[6468.10 - 6473.10] P:1675.26 E:0.092373 |  in Munich over the course of the last day of soft, since so many Ecuador flags,
[6473.10 - 6478.10] P:1832.87 E:0.092678 |  feels like the whole Pacho family must be here, Demfries now for Inter on the right,
[6478.10 - 6481.10] P:1696.39 E:0.101868 |  and it comes with the whole Martín has thought about the overhead kick there,
[6481.10 - 6487.10] P:1789.96 E:0.099127 |  it was just over him, he was setting himself for it, and then realised he couldn't do it.
[6487.10 - 6493.10] P:1603.94 E:0.091901 |  Just for a second, it looked like it was within reach, I think, but then you got back and
[6493.10 - 6496.10] P:1448.09 E:0.089519 |  you smelt the danger, cleared the danger.
[6496.10 - 6502.10] P:1527.34 E:0.092603 |  Yeah, for older listeners, it was a bit like that feeling when you're trying to get up and you think,
[6502.10 - 6506.10] P:1588.76 E:0.089960 |  can I get up out of this? No, I'm not going to be able to get up out of the seat here.
[6506.10 - 6512.10] P:1574.95 E:0.097773 |  So, in fact, if you can picture that, for younger listeners, one day that'll come to you,
[6512.10 - 6520.10] P:1726.79 E:0.087921 |  Novak Djokovic has won the first set against the qualifier, Philip Misalich, the French Open,
[6520.10 - 6526.10] P:1554.77 E:0.094966 |  so Djokovic is one set up, and if Djokovic wins that, he will play Cameron Norrie in the fourth round
[6526.10 - 6531.10] P:1422.13 E:0.101974 |  after his win against Britain's Jacob Fernley, Jack Draper won earlier.
[6531.10 - 6538.10] P:1493.32 E:0.088561 |  Stacks of coverage and commentary, again, tomorrow that you'll hear from us at BBC Radio.
[6538.10 - 6543.10] P:1718.55 E:0.104635 |  Hakimi is dispossessed, now then Inter, Barela plays it through for De Marco,
[6543.10 - 6548.10] P:1718.98 E:0.113102 |  looks as though he was offside and eventually the flag goes down, even though Hakimi was able to recover
[6548.10 - 6551.10] P:1708.54 E:0.099604 |  in any case and put the tackle in on De Marco.
[6551.10 - 6555.10] P:1762.86 E:0.091582 |  I just wondered for a second whether Barela could have had a shot there,
[6555.10 - 6561.10] P:1669.51 E:0.080274 |  done a rumour out of his goal in that right-back position, the PSG,
[6561.10 - 6566.10] P:1749.67 E:0.090847 |  and again, let's play from Hakimi, just for a moment, Barela thought he could have taken a touch
[6566.10 - 6571.10] P:1771.55 E:0.081342 |  and had a shot, he didn't, elected to pass to De Marco, who had drifted offside.
[6571.10 - 6576.10] P:1562.11 E:0.083384 |  There's been very little combination play, though, from Inter in the final third.
[6576.10 - 6578.10] P:1536.90 E:0.060211 |  And at the ball.
[6578.10 - 6581.10] P:1762.68 E:0.085722 |  That's why there's been very little combination play, John.
[6581.10 - 6589.10] P:1673.37 E:0.103432 |  PSG 2-0 up, this is the fifth final out of the now 70 finals in this competition
[6589.10 - 6593.10] P:1453.57 E:0.107814 |  that has been hosted here in Munich, and if you haven't heard,
[6593.10 - 6598.10] P:1577.27 E:0.098576 |  what is a remarkable fact is that all of the finals, the previous four finals,
[6598.10 - 6600.10] P:1698.52 E:0.091387 |  have featured first-time winners.
[6600.10 - 6602.10] P:1749.08 E:0.095188 |  And what have we got here?
[6602.10 - 6607.10] P:1725.14 E:0.091856 |  The potential of a first-time winner with PSG 2-0 up.
[6607.10 - 6613.10] P:1414.02 E:0.107937 |  PSG lost here this season in the league phase against Bayern Munich
[6613.10 - 6616.10] P:1417.14 E:0.104168 |  when Dembele was sent off, and actually it was this referee,
[6616.10 - 6619.10] P:1563.67 E:0.089355 |  Isdán Kovács, who sent him off in that match.
[6619.10 - 6620.10] P:1567.90 E:0.082357 |  Straight right.
[6620.10 - 6626.10] P:1736.59 E:0.081529 |  Two yellows, one for descent and one for a tackle that was disputed
[6626.10 - 6629.10] P:1448.86 E:0.094480 |  on Alfonso Davis, Inter coming forward.
[6629.10 - 6631.10] P:1422.45 E:0.098916 |  They won here against Bayern Munich.
[6631.10 - 6632.10] P:1672.34 E:0.101174 |  This is better.
[6632.10 - 6633.10] P:1517.34 E:0.104735 |  Ball down the right, pulled back.
[6633.10 - 6637.10] P:1715.33 E:0.093837 |  Martinez, though, that was cut out, comes back across the PSG area,
[6637.10 - 6641.10] P:1708.23 E:0.104209 |  and Vettini has had to head it down and head it away, and it's out for a throw.
[6641.10 - 6645.10] P:1802.50 E:0.111082 |  Yeah, on a couple of occasions, Vettini has been really well positioned
[6645.10 - 6648.10] P:1822.99 E:0.073122 |  when the ball has gone into the PSG box.
[6648.10 - 6652.10] P:1523.17 E:0.102098 |  There's a good run from Pavard, initially, to release him,
[6652.10 - 6657.10] P:1656.87 E:0.088517 |  and maybe took the wrong option, but for Vettini it...
[6657.10 - 6660.10] P:1551.86 E:0.096095 |  Balls out of play for a throw in 2-2 PSG.
[6660.10 - 6663.10] P:1647.17 E:0.106208 |  So Paris-Saint-Germain leading through the goals from Hakeemi and Douay
[6663.10 - 6668.10] P:1779.12 E:0.094797 |  in the 12th and 20th minutes, which means they are in tall position here.
[6668.10 - 6674.10] P:1677.71 E:0.092143 |  They become the 24th club, the 24th different club, to win this competition.
[6674.10 - 6680.10] P:1475.53 E:0.093739 |  And a couple of those first-time winners in Munich, Nottingham Forest,
[6680.10 - 6683.10] P:1651.58 E:0.092595 |  in the old Olympic Stadium, and Chelsea.
[6683.10 - 6687.10] P:1687.02 E:0.091962 |  Last time it was staged here in 2012. PSG pouring forward.
[6687.10 - 6690.10] P:1878.54 E:0.093687 |  Hakeemi again, Douay together, Douay again in field.
[6690.10 - 6694.10] P:1663.59 E:0.087545 |  Look at that confidence, Chris, outside of his boot, to Dembele.
[6694.10 - 6699.10] P:1767.68 E:0.097751 |  Dembele into the box, but the cross is deflected wide of the near post corner to PSG.
[6699.10 - 6703.10] P:1663.30 E:0.096688 |  It's wonderful, from Douay chopping in on that right-hand side,
[6703.10 - 6708.10] P:1642.72 E:0.089463 |  outside of the boot, right footed past Dembele.
[6708.10 - 6712.10] P:1730.28 E:0.082348 |  Once again, he's not playing as a conventional striker on the move
[6712.10 - 6718.10] P:1626.17 E:0.095657 |  to the left-hand side of the box, and then she gets a shot off that block.
[6718.10 - 6723.10] P:1382.19 E:0.097924 |  So somewhere through all of that fine mist to our right,
[6723.10 - 6728.10] P:1577.73 E:0.086271 |  Nuno Mendes, another of the PSG Portuguese contingent,
[6728.10 - 6732.10] P:1825.15 E:0.094288 |  is going to take this corner and out-swing it towards the penalty spot.
[6732.10 - 6735.10] P:1693.44 E:0.098755 |  Oh, the top of Marquinhos, and we might have been pushed over by a Terby.
[6735.10 - 6738.10] P:1713.50 E:0.094383 |  It's dinked back into the back post, but that's all that everyone is through.
[6738.10 - 6741.10] P:1657.47 E:0.095416 |  And Marquinhos is saying to referee Kovac,
[6741.10 - 6743.10] P:1696.15 E:0.093696 |  how about that for a push on me?
[6743.10 - 6750.10] P:1577.71 E:0.084440 |  Yeah, I mean, I'd my eye on that, and there's a tiniest little touch from Marquinhos.
[6750.10 - 6753.10] P:1858.34 E:0.078156 |  But Marquinhos is better than that, John.
[6753.10 - 6756.10] P:1762.64 E:0.091764 |  Yes, he is. You played against Inter, didn't you?
[6756.10 - 6760.10] P:1653.11 E:0.090441 |  Against those rugged Inter defenders in your time?
[6760.10 - 6763.10] P:1545.73 E:0.101778 |  Birgimi, one of the best.
[6763.10 - 6766.10] P:1514.70 E:0.102600 |  Did he give you a little nudge?
[6766.10 - 6770.10] P:1539.86 E:0.087999 |  He was very, very sort of cagey at blocking, I should say.
[6770.10 - 6774.10] P:1692.12 E:0.071690 |  Yes, he rips a tickle, did he?
[6774.10 - 6776.10] P:1642.36 E:0.104009 |  More than a tickle, John.
[6776.10 - 6781.10] P:1667.84 E:0.088578 |  I think he was famous for being slightly rough.
[6781.10 - 6787.10] P:1442.20 E:0.096224 |  He was. I think that understates it nicely.
[6787.10 - 6792.10] P:1471.15 E:0.092865 |  PSG with a ball inside their own half, a sweltering night here.
[6792.10 - 6794.10] P:1461.46 E:0.101539 |  That's the other thing as well.
[6794.10 - 6797.10] P:1613.43 E:0.108873 |  They are an aging team, as we have said, over and over and over again.
[6797.10 - 6801.10] P:1677.07 E:0.086721 |  And an aging team without the ball having to chase and chase,
[6801.10 - 6803.10] P:1248.41 E:0.104567 |  that is not ideal.
[6803.10 - 6806.10] P:1414.73 E:0.090951 |  And in fact, to underline this,
[6806.10 - 6808.10] P:1558.09 E:0.097029 |  Inzaghi has taken off his jacket,
[6808.10 - 6811.10] P:1587.93 E:0.088190 |  so he is in his white shirt sleeves,
[6811.10 - 6816.10] P:1578.94 E:0.083885 |  thin black tie hanging down just like his lank black hair.
[6816.10 - 6818.10] P:1707.43 E:0.085489 |  Pacchol, edge of the area.
[6818.10 - 6820.10] P:1566.51 E:0.088676 |  Left footed to the edge of the area,
[6820.10 - 6822.10] P:1622.20 E:0.088696 |  is cut out there by Cialanollo.
[6822.10 - 6826.10] P:1662.88 E:0.098249 |  And then it's worked away by PSG.
[6826.10 - 6829.10] P:1639.05 E:0.096337 |  Here they come again, over the half-way line,
[6829.10 - 6830.10] P:1792.24 E:0.084411 |  back to Dronneves.
[6830.10 - 6833.10] P:1720.76 E:0.101020 |  The PSG supporters groan, they just want them to go forward,
[6833.10 - 6835.10] P:1804.52 E:0.088998 |  forward and forward.
[6835.10 - 6836.10] P:1691.58 E:0.082633 |  But they are now.
[6836.10 - 6840.10] P:1607.53 E:0.082721 |  Dambali on the right-hand side, back to little Vettiniere.
[6840.10 - 6841.10] P:1705.49 E:0.098768 |  Vettiniere again.
[6841.10 - 6844.10] P:1742.30 E:0.102320 |  Dambali into the penalty area, goes for the shot come cross,
[6844.10 - 6847.10] P:1851.35 E:0.095292 |  which hits the shins of De Marcal,
[6847.10 - 6850.10] P:1772.03 E:0.098892 |  and bounces behind for a PSG corner from the right this time.
[6850.10 - 6854.10] P:1546.01 E:0.088021 |  They're just interchanged so well, don't they?
[6854.10 - 6859.10] P:1327.96 E:0.111221 |  Dambali on the drift, on the left, on the right this time.
[6859.10 - 6863.10] P:1416.25 E:0.104323 |  Always trying to shift the ball on the inside and
[6863.10 - 6864.10] P:1579.86 E:0.118133 |  fire shots off.
[6864.10 - 6869.10] P:1498.56 E:0.099774 |  They just look so much slicker, so much in control.
[6869.10 - 6874.10] P:1388.66 E:0.098649 |  PSG in every area.
[6874.10 - 6878.10] P:1524.96 E:0.090546 |  They are dominating it with just over ten minutes to go to
[6878.10 - 6879.10] P:1707.36 E:0.106379 |  halftime.
[6879.10 - 6882.10] P:1566.31 E:0.093507 |  This Champions League final five-live from the BBC.
[6882.10 - 6885.10] P:1720.70 E:0.098315 |  Listening as well on the World Service, wherever you are,
[6885.10 - 6889.10] P:1575.63 E:0.096096 |  on what is a late Saturday evening now here in the south of
[6889.10 - 6890.10] P:1462.21 E:0.105958 |  Germany.
[6890.10 - 6893.10] P:1640.85 E:0.098132 |  No-namendous with this latest corner to the back post.
[6893.10 - 6897.10] P:1630.67 E:0.078411 |  Marquinhos was after it, and it was deflected onto him,
[6897.10 - 6902.10] P:1570.17 E:0.096765 |  actually, by a chair-beat and behind for a goal kick.
[6902.10 - 6905.10] P:1589.31 E:0.107339 |  So, Douay, what a night he's had so far.
[6905.10 - 6909.10] P:1627.99 E:0.103674 |  The 19-year-old, he's 20 on Tuesday as well, so his birthday,
[6909.10 - 6912.10] P:1527.24 E:0.093517 |  just a couple of days away.
[6912.10 - 6916.10] P:1675.35 E:0.092924 |  He scored the goal that clinched the title for PSG this season.
[6916.10 - 6920.10] P:1575.25 E:0.091769 |  And if you remember, this is his fourth goal in the Champions League.
[6920.10 - 6925.10] P:1490.79 E:0.090102 |  He scored a vital goal against Aston Villa in the first leg.
[6925.10 - 6930.10] P:1475.92 E:0.085093 |  They equalised that when Rodgers had given Villa the lead in the
[6930.10 - 6934.10] P:1636.86 E:0.096283 |  park de France as intercom forward, Mekaterian.
[6934.10 - 6938.10] P:1793.33 E:0.101979 |  His ball across the area, flicked away by the heels of Patio,
[6938.10 - 6943.10] P:1659.89 E:0.085586 |  which took it away from Touran, and it's out for a throw-in to PSG
[6943.10 - 6946.10] P:1574.23 E:0.105458 |  10 yards away from their own corner fly.
[6946.10 - 6951.10] P:1621.41 E:0.095281 |  Producer Gary just points me to this, and that is, with that
[6951.10 - 6956.10] P:1482.23 E:0.088447 |  goal, Desiree Douay has become the third teenager to score in a
[6956.10 - 6958.10] P:1611.96 E:0.081670 |  Champions League final.
[6958.10 - 6960.10] P:1435.10 E:0.099213 |  That was Patrick Clive, that was a goal.
[6960.10 - 6962.10] P:1333.76 E:0.055716 |  Yes, he was one of them.
[6962.10 - 6964.10] P:1490.70 E:0.107797 |  Do you know the other one?
[6964.10 - 6966.10] P:1477.27 E:0.090500 |  Carlos Alberto.
[6966.10 - 6971.10] P:1628.13 E:0.087839 |  It was! Honestly, Chris, you were on fire tonight.
[6971.10 - 6975.10] P:1775.47 E:0.083428 |  Carlos Alberto for... Who was it again?
[6975.10 - 6976.10] P:1822.51 E:0.118870 |  Who was he playing for?
[6976.10 - 6980.10] P:1606.54 E:0.087609 |  Ah, I cheated, John. I did say on every screen there.
[6980.10 - 6984.10] P:1538.42 E:0.073665 |  It was for Porto against Monaco.
[6984.10 - 6989.10] P:1612.71 E:0.089883 |  I did say, John, on BBC, on five lives this morning, to Ellie,
[6989.10 - 6993.10] P:1578.00 E:0.088817 |  that Douay would be the key man this evening.
[6993.10 - 6997.10] P:1557.82 E:0.103533 |  They should get you on again in the morning, then, and talk about it.
[6997.10 - 7001.10] P:1693.10 E:0.090052 |  Here is Marquinhos, long pass-down field from him, but some are
[7001.10 - 7003.10] P:1273.72 E:0.112223 |  able to come and get it.
[7003.10 - 7007.10] P:1740.93 E:0.080538 |  Well, this has been torrid for Inter this first half in a season.
[7007.10 - 7012.10] P:1585.31 E:0.094961 |  Well, it's been a nearly season for them, and this, even though there
[7012.10 - 7015.10] P:1592.48 E:0.106206 |  is a long way to go, there's over half of the match to go,
[7015.10 - 7020.10] P:1419.14 E:0.090403 |  10 minutes to go to halftime, it's a tall order already for them.
[7020.10 - 7024.10] P:1694.55 E:0.096502 |  But Martínez and Turand together, Dumfries makes the run,
[7024.10 - 7027.10] P:1580.91 E:0.103561 |  but Turand goes back and goes in the other direction.
[7027.10 - 7030.10] P:1592.82 E:0.097580 |  So now Dumfries is there on the edge of the penalty area.
[7030.10 - 7033.10] P:1722.47 E:0.097859 |  Now the yellow shirts, these goldy yellow shirts with that sort of
[7033.10 - 7037.10] P:1724.35 E:0.093565 |  bluish-mottled effect on the sides, ball on the right-hand side,
[7037.10 - 7041.10] P:1856.62 E:0.102704 |  whipped across to the near post, but Pacho is there in front of Turand
[7041.10 - 7043.10] P:1775.46 E:0.106808 |  just to see it behind for a corner.
[7043.10 - 7046.10] P:1865.83 E:0.098478 |  It only takes a goal, doesn't it, from Inter?
[7046.10 - 7050.10] P:1952.24 E:0.091216 |  You know, 2-0, everybody talks about the next goal.
[7050.10 - 7053.10] P:2097.67 E:0.111632 |  That's all it will take for PSG to get nervous.
[7053.10 - 7056.10] P:2057.29 E:0.088027 |  Yes, exactly.
[7056.10 - 7062.10] P:2076.37 E:0.106504 |  And after being involved in that semi-final, then anything's possible.
[7062.10 - 7064.10] P:2117.62 E:0.099598 |  Inter with the corner. Here it is, curling to the back post.
[7064.10 - 7067.10] P:1813.80 E:0.108970 |  Headed all wide, wide by Turand.
[7067.10 - 7070.10] P:1778.16 E:0.083346 |  He got up so well at the back post, he headed it wide
[7070.10 - 7073.10] P:1716.33 E:0.105125 |  of the post instead of inside the post.
[7073.10 - 7078.10] P:1715.92 E:0.075744 |  And I have to say, for a split second there, I thought that's in.
[7078.10 - 7081.10] P:1794.89 E:0.098142 |  Yep, same. We are right behind this.
[7081.10 - 7083.10] P:1845.11 E:0.103192 |  He sees it all the way, Turand, gets up brilliantly.
[7083.10 - 7086.10] P:1789.26 E:0.081714 |  It's a poor header, he's six yards out.
[7086.10 - 7089.10] P:1712.56 E:0.082676 |  Nearly level with the far post.
[7089.10 - 7092.10] P:1766.65 E:0.090954 |  I think he's trying to be too accurate there.
[7092.10 - 7095.10] P:1806.67 E:0.095302 |  Always thinking those situations go back across the goalkeeper
[7095.10 - 7099.10] P:1709.46 E:0.092478 |  into the far corner, tries to beat Don O'Rourke at his near post.
[7099.10 - 7103.10] P:1793.61 E:0.101722 |  And it's a yard wide. That's their biggest opportunity.
[7103.10 - 7106.10] P:1886.26 E:0.092922 |  And you sort of feel, John, they have to take them.
[7106.10 - 7111.10] P:1904.01 E:0.096340 |  PSG still two-nil up. That's Chris Sutton, Premier League winner,
[7111.10 - 7116.10] P:1851.89 E:0.089997 |  Champions League player, Champions League goal scorer against some of the big clubs.
[7116.10 - 7120.10] P:1531.69 E:0.092040 |  And indeed, played in a European final.
[7120.10 - 7125.10] P:1605.81 E:0.094754 |  Well, it's been Paris and Jermain's final so far this one.
[7125.10 - 7130.10] P:1453.61 E:0.104044 |  Attempting, as I say, to become the 24th different club to win it.
[7130.10 - 7134.10] P:1507.99 E:0.092482 |  Six English clubs have won it.
[7134.10 - 7140.10] P:1486.05 E:0.094212 |  Celtic, of course, the first British club to win this competition back in 1967.
[7140.10 - 7148.10] P:1581.76 E:0.095956 |  But Marseille, the great rivals of PSG, the only French club thus far
[7148.10 - 7152.10] P:1613.46 E:0.093082 |  to have lifted the famous trophy.
[7152.10 - 7158.10] P:1571.45 E:0.085122 |  To goal kick. Goal kick for PSG is half-time approaches.
[7158.10 - 7164.10] P:1508.13 E:0.080704 |  Don Arumma waiting to take this, the former AC Milan goalkeeper.
[7164.10 - 7169.10] P:1611.15 E:0.087294 |  That's where he cut his teeth. Don Arumma, I was watching him last night.
[7169.10 - 7172.10] P:1660.00 E:0.092090 |  They actually played a match without any goalkeepers.
[7172.10 - 7175.10] P:1416.84 E:0.097376 |  And Don Arumma was playing as an outfielder.
[7175.10 - 7179.10] P:1363.52 E:0.096854 |  And I have to say, Chris, he looked like an absolute liability.
[7179.10 - 7183.10] P:1599.32 E:0.107637 |  But, of course, the team passes the ball out of play for it.
[7183.10 - 7186.10] P:1331.01 E:0.093236 |  Throw in to Inter on the half-way line.
[7186.10 - 7189.10] P:1507.77 E:0.089040 |  Inter just with a little sniff here.
[7189.10 - 7192.10] P:1496.41 E:0.108463 |  Tiny, tiniest aroma.
[7192.10 - 7196.10] P:1611.59 E:0.096716 |  When you started that Don Arumma outfield, a conversation there.
[7196.10 - 7199.10] P:1325.80 E:0.090641 |  I thought it was going to end like that.
[7199.10 - 7203.10] P:1495.10 E:0.096256 |  It's a through for Don Arumma who was able to.
[7203.10 - 7205.10] P:1560.28 E:0.096277 |  Marquinhos left it and Don Arumma was very quickly out.
[7205.10 - 7209.10] P:1583.20 E:0.087089 |  As we know he can do, and he got the ball very safely.
[7209.10 - 7212.10] P:1597.88 E:0.100419 |  In all honesty, Chris, I thought Don Arumma in that match last night
[7212.10 - 7216.10] P:1591.72 E:0.093793 |  was going to take out at least a couple of PSG players out of the final.
[7216.10 - 7218.10] P:1605.30 E:0.097074 |  As the ball is played to the edge of the air.
[7218.10 - 7224.10] P:1750.66 E:0.102386 |  Turan with a flick. Martínez tries to get there, but Marquinhos very coolly steps across.
[7224.10 - 7231.10] P:1681.19 E:0.082879 |  There's a little exchange between Marquinhos and Don Arumma, which was quite firm.
[7231.10 - 7233.10] P:1698.59 E:0.081833 |  And they come again.
[7233.10 - 7240.10] P:1635.34 E:0.086313 |  Inter with Bastoni, the defender of the year in the Italian top flight this season.
[7240.10 - 7244.10] P:1748.42 E:0.099338 |  Now Don Fris on the right-hand side, ball in, cleared by Marquinhos.
[7244.10 - 7247.10] P:1713.77 E:0.090761 |  Barela with a heavy touch. Marquinhos then on the challenge,
[7247.10 - 7251.10] P:1758.67 E:0.096650 |  but the Italian international, Barela, is able to hold Don Fris with a cross.
[7251.10 - 7254.10] P:1774.42 E:0.096781 |  Pat Show wasn't quite sure in the end, half-leaded away.
[7254.10 - 7260.10] P:1506.30 E:0.084257 |  And Kravitz-Kalia is able to take it down and pass it back into the PSG.
[7260.10 - 7266.10] P:1626.19 E:0.098957 |  Depends on the first real period of the match where PSG have been under any sort of what you would describe
[7266.10 - 7272.10] P:1676.80 E:0.091428 |  as being sustained pressure. And they're back in possession now, just as they like it.
[7272.10 - 7275.10] P:1641.26 E:0.108783 |  Little Vitini, the former Wolves midfielder.
[7275.10 - 7278.10] P:1571.13 E:0.090730 |  Don't forget, plays it via Don Ballet.
[7278.10 - 7283.10] P:1615.53 E:0.092518 |  Kravitz-Kalia is on the move now with his socks down, back to Don Ballet, 20 yards out.
[7283.10 - 7285.10] P:1613.79 E:0.081220 |  Don Ballet clips it across the penalty area.
[7285.10 - 7288.10] P:1648.91 E:0.100761 |  Douay, who's been quiet actually the last 20 minutes or so.
[7288.10 - 7293.10] P:1637.79 E:0.089113 |  But we can give him that after his opening 20 minutes, when he created one goal and scored the other.
[7293.10 - 7299.10] P:1560.25 E:0.096945 |  Two now it is to Luis Enriquez, Paris Saint-Germain, Fabian Ruiz now with the ball,
[7299.10 - 7305.10] P:1496.69 E:0.085658 |  and it's flicked back towards the half-way line, and here is Vitini again.
[7305.10 - 7307.10] P:1597.82 E:0.099403 |  Absolutely loves the ball at his feet.
[7307.10 - 7310.10] P:1652.30 E:0.090485 |  Gets it back now from Dempeli in a deep-lying position.
[7310.10 - 7313.10] P:1710.62 E:0.085110 |  Kravitz-Kalia is in a central area.
[7313.10 - 7320.10] P:1643.50 E:0.092853 |  Then Schwaun-Neves, playing as the deeper of the three really over the course of the match so far, the little number 87.
[7320.10 - 7326.10] P:1520.81 E:0.085758 |  Then he gets it back, Schwaun-Neves, Fabian Ruiz passing the ball between the two of them.
[7326.10 - 7328.10] P:1723.06 E:0.081998 |  It's almost like watching a training exercise.
[7328.10 - 7336.10] P:1664.79 E:0.076378 |  Now Marquinhos with the thick, curly hair, he brings it forward to the right flank, Hakimi,
[7336.10 - 7341.10] P:1551.27 E:0.089170 |  and then PSG go back towards the half-way line, and it snuffed out that pressure.
[7341.10 - 7346.10] P:1786.04 E:0.101629 |  Although Marquinhos has over-hit the ball away beyond Dempeli and out for a throw-in.
[7346.10 - 7348.10] P:1824.66 E:0.084730 |  But that's all it's done there.
[7348.10 - 7353.10] P:1705.67 E:0.091005 |  PSG, that little bit of pressure that Inter had, PSG get the ball back and just keep it.
[7353.10 - 7361.10] P:1712.83 E:0.092335 |  It's not sustained, because Inter, they're not capable of keeping the ball for long periods
[7361.10 - 7367.10] P:1441.66 E:0.103532 |  because of PSG, they're more mobile, more athletic, the press is better.
[7367.10 - 7374.10] P:1433.14 E:0.097447 |  There we see Hakimi right up, some of the clips of all-out left-footed, right up on DiMarco,
[7374.10 - 7378.10] P:1478.01 E:0.089929 |  and left wing back for Inter, not letting him get his head up.
[7378.10 - 7382.10] P:1751.45 E:0.103746 |  We've barely seen him in this game, DiMarco, he's such an important player.
[7382.10 - 7389.10] P:1516.62 E:0.088502 |  We talk about the Inter wing backs, and what a great season both of them have had,
[7389.10 - 7392.10] P:1417.47 E:0.084302 |  but tonight they barely had a kick.
[7392.10 - 7397.10] P:1193.62 E:0.097528 |  Here is Nuno Mendes, heads it forward towards the half-way line.
[7397.10 - 7399.10] P:1643.15 E:0.097794 |  It was quite a contrast last night.
[7399.10 - 7405.10] P:1733.55 E:0.096627 |  I mentioned the PSG approach, very relaxed, Donoroma doing what he was doing,
[7405.10 - 7410.10] P:1634.97 E:0.094753 |  Inter claiming that this throw-in should have gone their way, or possibly a handball actually there.
[7410.10 - 7414.10] P:1704.25 E:0.082991 |  Inter were absolutely on it.
[7414.10 - 7418.10] P:1534.38 E:0.096056 |  Their approach in their training session last night, we're able to watch all of it.
[7418.10 - 7422.10] P:1356.07 E:0.106297 |  I mean, Nzargi was acting like it was a proper match.
[7422.10 - 7427.10] P:1418.41 E:0.097086 |  He was like he normally is on the touchline, it was very, very intense.
[7427.10 - 7431.10] P:1684.46 E:0.096115 |  Different approaches, you do what you think is right, don't you?
[7431.10 - 7433.10] P:1593.79 E:0.095660 |  Absolutely, in the end all that matters is...
[7433.10 - 7435.10] P:1663.07 E:0.077391 |  What happens here?
[7435.10 - 7441.10] P:1579.52 E:0.094775 |  And here is Kvaratskalia, now a little ball in, and then back to the half-way line.
[7441.10 - 7444.10] P:1537.51 E:0.097085 |  Kvaratskalia, who's already...
[7444.10 - 7447.10] P:1433.94 E:0.100227 |  He's got two championship winners medals this season,
[7447.10 - 7450.10] P:1469.77 E:0.097554 |  because he obviously got one for Napoli now, so Napoli and PSG,
[7450.10 - 7454.10] P:1745.16 E:0.092376 |  ball down the left-hand side, and they come again with Douay, PSG,
[7454.10 - 7457.10] P:1712.95 E:0.105009 |  into the box, whipped across at the back post, and it's driven!
[7457.10 - 7460.10] P:1532.74 E:0.094175 |  Now did that actually come off the frame of the goal?
[7460.10 - 7464.10] P:1703.91 E:0.069478 |  The attempt at the back post from Dempale,
[7464.10 - 7469.10] P:1580.86 E:0.085160 |  it's been kept in play on the far side, they come again, PSG, edge of the box.
[7469.10 - 7473.10] P:1567.90 E:0.097086 |  Dempale was the man at the far post who was stretching for the contact on that.
[7473.10 - 7474.10] P:1487.57 E:0.092838 |  What happened to him?
[7474.10 - 7477.10] P:1699.74 E:0.099135 |  I hope for his sake it did come off the frame of the goal,
[7477.10 - 7481.10] P:1562.91 E:0.085334 |  because that would have been a bad enough miss anyway.
[7481.10 - 7484.10] P:1816.01 E:0.098553 |  Douay once again out on that left-hand side,
[7484.10 - 7487.10] P:1748.14 E:0.095364 |  causing carnage with the cross at the back post.
[7487.10 - 7491.10] P:1829.64 E:0.083523 |  Dempale just goes to the end, he must have been two yards out.
[7491.10 - 7495.10] P:1490.49 E:0.100171 |  Back post, arriving back post, there was a defender there as well,
[7495.10 - 7500.10] P:1394.65 E:0.097138 |  however, the ball pinged away out to the far side,
[7500.10 - 7504.10] P:1479.72 E:0.088491 |  and I can only assume it's come off the Angla-Post and Baros or some such.
[7504.10 - 7510.10] P:1474.77 E:0.080929 |  So could easily have been 3-0, Inter with Martinez.
[7510.10 - 7514.10] P:1670.75 E:0.081889 |  Another goal there, and I have to be honest,
[7514.10 - 7518.10] P:1686.21 E:0.093655 |  you'd have to say that would have, with the way that the match has gone,
[7518.10 - 7521.10] P:1537.37 E:0.081789 |  it would have been incredibly difficult to think that
[7521.10 - 7526.10] P:1593.26 E:0.098780 |  Inter could come back from that in the final, in the Champions League.
[7526.10 - 7527.10] P:1611.70 E:0.114723 |  How's that before?
[7527.10 - 7531.10] P:1786.09 E:0.089366 |  That would have been Curtains, I don't know what Curtains is in Italian,
[7531.10 - 7538.10] P:1664.67 E:0.081847 |  but that's Hakeemi, the PSG right back, pressing high.
[7538.10 - 7543.10] P:1678.48 E:0.090084 |  I think it's Pavard and Ciannololo in the right back position,
[7543.10 - 7547.10] P:1693.02 E:0.084486 |  the opposite side of the pitch for PSG.
[7547.10 - 7551.10] P:1477.90 E:0.104682 |  You need Alistair Bruce Ball with you, Chris,
[7551.10 - 7554.10] P:1360.39 E:0.101382 |  to know what Curtains is in Italian.
[7554.10 - 7557.10] P:1328.29 E:0.094683 |  Very good, isn't he?
[7557.10 - 7563.10] P:1405.28 E:0.087866 |  Apparently it is Kende, or some such.
[7563.10 - 7566.10] P:1548.82 E:0.098033 |  He had a year of polytechnic over there, I think, didn't he?
[7566.10 - 7569.10] P:1577.40 E:0.089171 |  He studied films, I think, didn't he, in Italy?
[7569.10 - 7573.10] P:1759.16 E:0.104927 |  Nuno Mendes cuts this ball out on the half-way line, plays it forward to Douay,
[7573.10 - 7577.10] P:1734.07 E:0.099738 |  Douay's got Fabri and Ruiz, Douay's still going, drips on, shoots low,
[7577.10 - 7581.10] P:1659.06 E:0.086820 |  Summer goes down to his left, but knew it was rolling wide.
[7581.10 - 7585.10] P:1480.30 E:0.092183 |  That would have absolutely put the seal on it if he'd been able to bury that one.
[7585.10 - 7590.10] P:1689.47 E:0.089816 |  And do you know what, he just drifts past, I think it's Miqueteri with the step over.
[7590.10 - 7593.10] P:1655.63 E:0.077066 |  Took the wrong option there.
[7593.10 - 7599.10] P:1700.49 E:0.092828 |  He had Nevezato, his left-hand side, but there's a tame shot from the shooting position.
[7599.10 - 7605.10] P:1630.67 E:0.101135 |  It put me in mind, actually, of the 20-Watson finish for Sunderland in the playoff final.
[7605.10 - 7607.10] P:1281.33 E:0.095099 |  That sort of passed it into the net.
[7607.10 - 7610.10] P:1340.78 E:0.082748 |  Is it not once off Sunderland now? Is he not off?
[7611.10 - 7617.10] P:1519.08 E:0.083504 |  It is, actually, isn't it? Yes, because the season is over for Sunderland.
[7617.10 - 7619.10] P:1476.79 E:0.113633 |  Next we see them, they'll be in the Premier League,
[7619.10 - 7622.10] P:1556.42 E:0.094028 |  they'll be coming to it in next season, Sunderland.
[7622.10 - 7626.10] P:1698.94 E:0.094011 |  More Premier League commentaries, even more Premier League commentaries,
[7626.10 - 7631.10] P:1478.31 E:0.092238 |  if you can believe that, than ever before, on Five Live.
[7631.10 - 7635.10] P:1383.30 E:0.086177 |  Sports Extra, Sports Extra 2, Sports Extra 3, next season.
[7635.10 - 7637.10] P:1492.62 E:0.100744 |  So join us for that.
[7637.10 - 7642.10] P:1619.63 E:0.096554 |  This is Paris-Saint-Germain in control, in charge of the Champions League final,
[7642.10 - 7645.10] P:1757.09 E:0.095125 |  in two minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
[7645.10 - 7649.10] P:1692.07 E:0.090293 |  And could easily there, in the latter stages, have increased their lead.
[7649.10 - 7655.10] P:1557.89 E:0.085068 |  But as it is, the goals from Hakini and Douay have built a platform
[7655.10 - 7661.10] P:1513.40 E:0.098224 |  for Luis Enrique's team, from which they are now strong, strong favourites to lift the trophy.
[7661.10 - 7664.10] P:1639.39 E:0.101847 |  And here comes Caravres-Caliar into the penalty area now.
[7664.10 - 7668.10] P:1598.97 E:0.093739 |  Italian defenders back-faddling, left foot shoots across goal and it's deflected.
[7668.10 - 7671.10] P:1650.82 E:0.092189 |  And it bounced rather awkwardly there.
[7671.10 - 7674.10] P:1847.07 E:0.107527 |  Summer was on his heels as he staggered across the goal line.
[7674.10 - 7679.10] P:1699.56 E:0.090632 |  And if it had taken a left turn there, it might have ended up in the back of the net.
[7679.10 - 7684.10] P:1650.33 E:0.090215 |  Oh yes, I think it's a yard and a half wider than the far post for...
[7684.10 - 7688.10] P:1550.42 E:0.107414 |  Grapple, Scaliere, chopping inside on his right foot,
[7688.10 - 7691.10] P:1598.68 E:0.098965 |  chopping again on the outside, left and getting the shot off.
[7691.10 - 7697.10] P:1592.60 E:0.089038 |  I think it comes off from Fries' right heel and drifts past to that far post.
[7697.10 - 7701.10] P:1647.67 E:0.101842 |  Excellent service from the staff in the media area here,
[7701.10 - 7704.10] P:1638.52 E:0.099039 |  topping us on the shoulder, asking if we want more water.
[7704.10 - 7710.10] P:1737.52 E:0.101885 |  Here is the corner and Crollards-Caliar heads it over from 8 yards, 9 yards out,
[7710.10 - 7716.10] P:1691.67 E:0.098960 |  curled onto his head by Dembele, took the corner and Crollards-Caliar couldn't keep it down.
[7716.10 - 7723.10] P:1781.95 E:0.104549 |  There's the halftime whistle and listen to that cheer from all of those Paris Saint-Germain supporters
[7723.10 - 7727.10] P:1790.15 E:0.097087 |  who are all on their feet, many of them with their shirts off, hands above their heads,
[7727.10 - 7731.10] P:1744.94 E:0.081401 |  clapping and saying what a half that was.
[7731.10 - 7734.10] P:1886.18 E:0.097061 |  First 45 minutes of a Champions League final,
[7734.10 - 7739.10] P:1802.41 E:0.088980 |  Paris Saint-Germain, they're halfway there to their first title in this competition.
[7739.10 - 7740.10] P:1861.84 E:0.072787 |  Yeah, but who needs them?
[7740.10 - 7744.10] P:1587.84 E:0.093092 |  Bapay, when you've got Douay, there was that call before the game.
[7744.10 - 7750.10] P:1649.46 E:0.087882 |  Douay would it be Bar-Cole up, it was in Recape, got the right call,
[7750.10 - 7754.10] P:1861.01 E:0.093624 |  didn't he, and Douay, brilliant for the first goal, just drifted onto the left-hand side of the box,
[7754.10 - 7758.10] P:1952.19 E:0.098059 |  turned most 19-year-olds in that situation, their eyes would have lit up
[7758.10 - 7761.10] P:1874.40 E:0.089699 |  and they would have tried to shoot, he didn't, composed himself,
[7761.10 - 7766.10] P:1747.04 E:0.077700 |  found Akimi, who stroked the ball in and then got the second goal,
[7766.10 - 7770.10] P:1874.32 E:0.089668 |  but this, John, has been an absolute mauling this first half.
[7770.10 - 7774.10] P:1768.41 E:0.078008 |  I think sitting here now, how are we going to get back into this game?
[7774.10 - 7779.10] P:1857.30 E:0.085511 |  Maybe there'll be changes at half-time, but at this moment in time,
[7779.10 - 7783.10] P:1687.74 E:0.067825 |  it looks like Champions League is going to Paris.
[7783.10 - 7787.10] P:1737.08 E:0.094851 |  Yeah, and what a half for the 19-year-old is last match as a 19-year-old
[7787.10 - 7792.10] P:1911.36 E:0.093086 |  before he leaves his teenage years, what a season he's had in the Champions League.
[7792.10 - 7797.10] P:1839.63 E:0.085509 |  I mentioned the goal that Douay scored against Aston Villa,
[7797.10 - 7801.10] P:1797.05 E:0.090934 |  that equaliser, the fact that he scored the goal that clinched the league for them.
[7801.10 - 7806.10] P:1772.62 E:0.098393 |  Remember, he was the one that scored the clinching penalty in the shootout at Anfield as well.
[7806.10 - 7813.10] P:1868.56 E:0.085294 |  So another chapter being written by Desiree Douay setting up one goal for Akimi,
[7813.10 - 7816.10] P:1827.96 E:0.093076 |  scoring the other himself, they could have had more at the end of the half,
[7816.10 - 7823.10] P:1729.51 E:0.072083 |  as it is here in Munich, Paris Saint-Germain 2-0 at half-time.
[7823.10 - 7830.10] P:1627.97 E:0.077320 |  And inside the stadium with us, Steve Crossman sits to my left with a healthy glow about him.
[7830.10 - 7834.10] P:1819.49 E:0.092000 |  Thanks very much, not as healthy as the glow of the man immediately to my right, Julian LeRan.
[7834.10 - 7836.10] P:1589.77 E:0.065817 |  How are we doing?
[7836.10 - 7840.10] P:1689.24 E:0.091178 |  Not sure about the glow, but certainly the heart is a bit better now.
[7840.10 - 7844.10] P:1612.19 E:0.076905 |  A half-time 2-0 up, although we've been in football far too long
[7844.10 - 7847.10] P:1470.70 E:0.091351 |  to think that this is over and that Inter are not going to come back better.
[7847.10 - 7849.10] P:1580.67 E:0.080879 |  They can't be like that in the second half.
[7849.10 - 7853.10] P:1684.63 E:0.098369 |  They can't be like that, Christoph, Christopher, even you know,
[7853.10 - 7856.10] P:1690.23 E:0.086550 |  that they can't be that bad again in the second half.
[7856.10 - 7860.10] P:1701.63 E:0.091239 |  They will have to change something, they will have to go for it, they will have to do something else.
[7860.10 - 7863.10] P:1791.88 E:0.083391 |  But I've loved this first half from PSG and again,
[7863.10 - 7869.10] P:1768.86 E:0.080872 |  there's nothing that PSG have done so far that we didn't know they were going to do,
[7869.10 - 7872.10] P:1835.90 E:0.090697 |  they were capable of doing, how they moved the ball so well,
[7872.10 - 7875.10] P:1716.14 E:0.089680 |  all that fluidity in that midfield within the structure,
[7875.10 - 7880.10] P:1794.30 E:0.087672 |  then the technical ability of Dwayne and Vascalia and then Belé.
[7880.10 - 7884.10] P:1686.74 E:0.081750 |  The pressing and counter-pressing has been exceptional tonight, really.
[7884.10 - 7888.10] P:1910.30 E:0.080265 |  And that's what the first half has come down to.
[7888.10 - 7893.10] P:1875.43 E:0.089866 |  Inter, you know, they've tried to beat the PSG press, you know, their philosophy will be,
[7893.10 - 7895.10] P:1901.89 E:0.083873 |  you know, can we beat that press?
[7895.10 - 7896.10] P:1862.38 E:0.093359 |  We should be able to.
[7896.10 - 7899.10] P:1936.81 E:0.081651 |  PSG have just absolutely smothered them, they've pressed them high,
[7899.10 - 7901.10] P:1742.48 E:0.087777 |  they've won the ball high up the pitch,
[7901.10 - 7907.10] P:1784.46 E:0.079013 |  went in to have gone long, Makinios and Patio at the back have controlled the front too,
[7907.10 - 7909.10] P:1873.54 E:0.094130 |  they've been too physical for them.
[7909.10 - 7913.10] P:1856.61 E:0.087689 |  So it's how on earth, it may be through a substitution,
[7913.10 - 7918.10] P:1897.08 E:0.088527 |  maybe it'll be through, you know, a moment, a set play, the two front players linking up.
[7918.10 - 7922.10] P:1879.21 E:0.081674 |  But this has been so one-sided, it surprised me.
[7922.10 - 7928.10] P:2001.21 E:0.099844 |  Inside the Allianz Arena now, there are just little laser lights all around the roof,
[7928.10 - 7930.10] P:1920.64 E:0.081516 |  all different shades.
[7930.10 - 7934.10] P:1950.67 E:0.095260 |  We've just seen pictures outside the stadium, the whole of the Allianz Arena,
[7934.10 - 7938.10] P:1972.22 E:0.085744 |  and I mean, the whole of it is now lit up in the various colours.
[7938.10 - 7943.10] P:1751.87 E:0.085418 |  The shades of blue into Milan, Paris Saint-Germain sort of starting to feel like
[7943.10 - 7946.10] P:1846.13 E:0.091456 |  you could just drop all the other colours and have it as blue and red.
[7946.10 - 7949.10] P:1946.80 E:0.076737 |  Jibs, Horncastle is back with us as well.
[7949.10 - 7951.10] P:2007.43 E:0.093211 |  What does Simone Insagi do now, Jibs?
[7951.10 - 7953.10] P:1771.31 E:0.048272 |  What can he do now?
[7953.10 - 7956.10] P:1772.94 E:0.075846 |  He has to say, you've got nothing to lose, lads.
[7956.10 - 7958.10] P:1653.47 E:0.084015 |  You've got to play for pride here.
[7958.10 - 7963.10] P:1774.63 E:0.079676 |  We have seen Champions League finals where teams have been further behind at this stage
[7963.10 - 7966.10] P:1717.70 E:0.074078 |  and they've come back, you know, in Istanbul.
[7966.10 - 7969.10] P:1822.30 E:0.071775 |  But what surprised me really about Inter, I mean,
[7969.10 - 7972.10] P:1703.19 E:0.073246 |  Chris was touching upon it there about the counter-pressing
[7972.10 - 7974.10] P:1754.74 E:0.078405 |  and how PSG have smothered them.
[7974.10 - 7978.10] P:1648.51 E:0.085334 |  I mean, Insagi said yesterday, yeah, we want the ball.
[7978.10 - 7982.10] P:1726.97 E:0.082695 |  We do not want PSG to have the ball, because if they have it,
[7982.10 - 7986.10] P:1646.34 E:0.074700 |  we're in trouble, particularly with those driblers that they've got.
[7986.10 - 7991.10] P:1594.06 E:0.080357 |  And I think what surprised me is that some of the players just haven't done their jobs,
[7991.10 - 7993.10] P:1637.41 E:0.084291 |  I think, as they would have liked.
[7993.10 - 7998.10] P:1638.73 E:0.076867 |  I mean, Federico Di Marco, the hometown kid, always supported Inter.
[7998.10 - 8001.10] P:1656.44 E:0.086935 |  Used to be in the Inter end when he was in a player,
[8001.10 - 8004.10] P:1554.56 E:0.078956 |  been at the club since he's six years old.
[8004.10 - 8009.10] P:1712.50 E:0.090374 |  You've seen him get pulled every which way and that.
[8009.10 - 8011.10] P:1680.00 E:0.091556 |  Particularly, I mean, on that first goal,
[8011.10 - 8013.10] P:1773.84 E:0.085112 |  what is he doing leaving Hageemi there?
[8013.10 - 8014.10] P:1752.75 E:0.098885 |  What is he doing?
[8014.10 - 8017.10] P:1848.19 E:0.078101 |  I mean, he goes to shut down a shot from Douay,
[8017.10 - 8021.10] P:1717.84 E:0.088698 |  which turns into an assist for a completely free Ashraf Hageemi.
[8021.10 - 8027.10] P:1871.85 E:0.085542 |  So, you know, I mean, I think it's very curious to see Insagi look at this team
[8027.10 - 8032.10] P:1737.72 E:0.084234 |  that has only been behind for 16 minutes in a Champions League going into this game,
[8032.10 - 8035.10] P:1823.31 E:0.072430 |  find itself behind, find itself two goals down.
[8035.10 - 8039.10] P:1841.55 E:0.079097 |  It's not a position that Inter are used to being in.
[8039.10 - 8044.10] P:1937.35 E:0.079789 |  You know, Jules, the one thing I can find for Inter here is that,
[8044.10 - 8046.10] P:1802.61 E:0.085526 |  okay, they're 2-0 down.
[8046.10 - 8051.10] P:1905.20 E:0.072964 |  I'm not sure PSG actually look that good at the back.
[8051.10 - 8054.10] P:1964.12 E:0.090430 |  I feel like Inter have managed to find the space a few times.
[8054.10 - 8059.10] P:1985.42 E:0.083729 |  Every time they've come forward, it's not like one of those finals where a team has got 2-0 up
[8059.10 - 8062.10] P:2024.19 E:0.090558 |  and they just look like they're going to be able to shut down at the back.
[8062.10 - 8065.10] P:1790.92 E:0.074835 |  The problem is, you feel like they're probably going to score again as well.
[8065.10 - 8066.10] P:1790.22 E:0.112503 |  Yeah, maybe.
[8066.10 - 8069.10] P:1787.52 E:0.073836 |  I mean, this is not a team that defends anyway.
[8069.10 - 8072.10] P:1767.03 E:0.083902 |  This team that very much attacks things about possession all the time
[8072.10 - 8077.10] P:1733.70 E:0.087048 |  and going forward, either building up as we saw on the first goal,
[8077.10 - 8082.10] P:1698.82 E:0.086730 |  because I didn't count exactly the amount of passes until Vittinia finds Douay,
[8082.10 - 8086.10] P:1847.61 E:0.091430 |  who then finds Hageemi, or in quick transitions like the second goal,
[8086.10 - 8091.10] P:1860.51 E:0.088393 |  because Inter attacking, patch against the ball, then Vars-Kelia to Dembele,
[8091.10 - 8094.10] P:1721.33 E:0.091760 |  Dembele to Douay, and yeah, they get lucky with the deflection on the Douay shot,
[8094.10 - 8097.10] P:1800.06 E:0.087987 |  but still, they can hit you on some different ways.
[8097.10 - 8102.10] P:1793.36 E:0.076999 |  But yeah, defensively, they're not as strong, I guess, than going forward.
[8102.10 - 8105.10] P:1777.82 E:0.088299 |  But I still think that despite a few good crosses from Dumfries,
[8105.10 - 8110.10] P:1764.06 E:0.086917 |  that could have fallen to Lautaro or to Ramm, and obviously to Ramm header on the corner.
[8110.10 - 8115.10] P:1816.32 E:0.077467 |  And we've said before, said PSG is big tonight, and the Hageemi one as well,
[8115.10 - 8120.10] P:1814.43 E:0.073924 |  but the two-run one is even the bigger chant than the Hageemi header on the other corner.
[8120.10 - 8123.10] P:1765.49 E:0.082887 |  I thought PSG did pretty well even defensively.
[8123.10 - 8125.10] P:1705.78 E:0.069084 |  Zero shots on target.
[8125.10 - 8126.10] P:1499.18 E:0.069408 |  Yeah, OK.
[8126.10 - 8130.10] P:1820.96 E:0.086165 |  But you know, for Inter, so I just think that, you know, the PSG,
[8130.10 - 8134.10] P:1813.18 E:0.089679 |  their two-send half-field they can deal with the two in the front-place.
[8134.10 - 8138.10] P:1879.28 E:0.087475 |  It's set-place, as Jules said, where they've had the chances to Ramm should have scored.
[8138.10 - 8142.10] P:1824.21 E:0.094779 |  But Jürgen maybe just didn't time his jump properly. Jürgen had that opportunity.
[8142.10 - 8145.10] P:1886.15 E:0.094882 |  And it's all about the next goal. That's the truth of it.
[8145.10 - 8147.10] P:1793.88 E:0.086598 |  The next goal, we know what's going to happen.
[8147.10 - 8150.10] P:1898.05 E:0.092206 |  James, what was that Italian word for superstitious again?
[8150.10 - 8151.10] P:1650.05 E:0.070552 |  Scaramantico.
[8151.10 - 8152.10] P:1694.73 E:0.067351 |  Scaramantico.
[8152.10 - 8155.10] P:1695.32 E:0.092795 |  Yeah, so what I was doing when I was being...
[8155.10 - 8158.10] P:1840.47 E:0.092066 |  I was guffando, wasn't I? I was, you know, being superstitious.
[8158.10 - 8162.10] P:1838.55 E:0.093842 |  So when I said that Inter would win, I was doing actually Jules a favour
[8162.10 - 8164.10] P:1607.17 E:0.106125 |  by saying something that wasn't going to happen.
[8164.10 - 8167.10] P:1709.97 E:0.103628 |  You said Jules would win 3-0. You're on course for your prediction.
[8167.10 - 8169.10] P:1819.72 E:0.089433 |  I presume now because you're Scaramantico, Jules.
[8169.10 - 8171.10] P:1853.20 E:0.093532 |  You're going to stay with us for the rest of the night, yeah?
[8171.10 - 8175.10] P:1676.04 E:0.097589 |  I can't move. I'm here to stay. I'm going to sleep here if he stays like this.
[8175.10 - 8177.10] P:1960.97 E:0.085203 |  Jules, James, thank you both very much.
[8177.10 - 8180.10] P:1956.48 E:0.088919 |  Right, Paris Saint-Germain 2, Inter Milan 0,
[8180.10 - 8182.10] P:1941.02 E:0.088315 |  half-time in the Champions League final.
[8182.10 - 8186.10] P:1798.51 E:0.088622 |  We are going to do some F1, some qualifying for the Grand Prix
[8186.10 - 8189.10] P:1851.02 E:0.083317 |  that you might have been listening to this afternoon.
[8189.10 - 8192.10] P:1859.27 E:0.086246 |  Live commentary from 2 o'clock tomorrow on 5 Live,
[8192.10 - 8194.10] P:1990.54 E:0.086952 |  McLaren's Oscar Piazzari on pole.
[8194.10 - 8197.10] P:1921.60 E:0.076312 |  We'll see if we can hear from him and Cam Noree.
[8197.10 - 8200.10] P:1904.61 E:0.089834 |  We'll be back to the French Open at Roland Garros as well.
[8200.10 - 8202.10] P:1872.36 E:0.085840 |  And then second half commentary from here at the Allianz,
[8202.10 - 8204.10] P:2097.75 E:0.083242 |  all after the news with Nick Horatio.
[8204.10 - 8206.10] P:1531.21 E:0.111045 |  The Voice of the UK.
[8206.10 - 8209.10] P:1420.28 E:0.109454 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[8209.10 - 8211.10] P:1584.39 E:0.101923 |  Thank you, Steve. The government says it's engaging with the US
[8211.10 - 8216.10] P:1789.96 E:0.090513 |  on the implications of President Trump doubling steel tariff imports to 50%.
[8216.10 - 8220.10] P:1876.68 E:0.083025 |  The announcement has created uncertainty for British steelmakers
[8220.10 - 8223.10] P:1837.24 E:0.088834 |  because the UK and US have agreed to remove the levees,
[8223.10 - 8225.10] P:1689.81 E:0.083029 |  but the deal hasn't yet been finalised.
[8225.10 - 8228.10] P:1870.23 E:0.084045 |  Liam Bates is from Marsha Galiar, a firm in Sheffield.
[8228.10 - 8231.10] P:1562.71 E:0.080549 |  15% to 20% of our business goes to the US,
[8231.10 - 8234.10] P:1405.77 E:0.103724 |  and the vast majority of it, 15% to 20%,
[8234.10 - 8237.10] P:1739.63 E:0.097026 |  is our own downstream production in the US.
[8237.10 - 8240.10] P:1550.19 E:0.101182 |  So steel is basically melting part one,

[8303.10 - 8307.10] P:1964.64 E:0.075048 |  but unlike the Cold War, it is not so neat and simplistic

[8345.10 - 8347.10] P:1723.70 E:0.095745 |  So what was it meant to say, then?
[8347.10 - 8348.10] P:1798.98 E:0.076517 |  Toga party.
[8348.10 - 8349.10] P:2051.73 E:0.070741 |  What?

[8350.10 - 8351.10] P:1952.85 E:0.081122 |  So they all came as moments.
[8351.10 - 8352.10] P:896.26 E:0.114231 |  I never thought of it like that.

[8376.10 - 8381.10] P:1913.81 E:0.091477 |  There's thousands of people just hold their phones in the air and put the torch on
[8381.10 - 8383.10] P:1917.02 E:0.092620 |  and wave it around like stars in the night sky.
[8383.10 - 8387.10] P:1933.09 E:0.086957 |  So many Paris Saint-Germain supporters were getting it on that,
[8387.10 - 8389.10] P:1682.55 E:0.077574 |  less into fans as you might imagine.
[8389.10 - 8394.10] P:2001.78 E:0.092389 |  Because here in the Champions League final, PSG lead into by two goals to nil.
[8394.10 - 8396.10] P:1635.00 E:0.084882 |  Fabian Ruiz has popped up there back to Petina.

[8404.10 - 8407.10] P:1572.75 E:0.112918 |  It's the right back. They love that.
[8407.10 - 8409.10] P:1472.32 E:0.114921 |  They love their goal-scoring right back.
[8409.10 - 8410.10] P:1546.33 E:0.103811 |  Stembelli.
[8410.10 - 8413.10] P:1749.93 E:0.101213 |  Shroud Nevers arriving. All the way across to the right.
[8413.10 - 8415.10] P:1663.08 E:0.110519 |  Do it with a shot to flake the ball.
[8415.10 - 8418.10] P:1532.01 E:0.116095 |  Pass, Summer. It's two-nil.
[8418.10 - 8424.10] P:1590.13 E:0.115054 |  PSG are off like a shot in this Champions League final.
[8424.10 - 8426.10] P:1733.06 E:0.061828 |  Second half commentary on the way.
[8426.10 - 8428.10] P:2006.30 E:0.106368 |  Let's go over to Roland Garros,
[8428.10 - 8431.10] P:2011.86 E:0.088915 |  primarily for an update on Djokovic-Musevich,
[8431.10 - 8433.10] P:2035.64 E:0.094712 |  but also Abigail, I am curious.
[8433.10 - 8437.10] P:1852.44 E:0.084367 |  Are there signs that this is happening here where you are,
[8437.10 - 8439.10] P:1819.24 E:0.077236 |  or does it feel like a different world?
[8439.10 - 8442.10] P:1781.74 E:0.086938 |  There have been fireworks today. There have been car horns.
[8442.10 - 8444.10] P:1823.87 E:0.078855 |  It's been a pretty chaotic evening.
[8444.10 - 8447.10] P:1847.38 E:0.082525 |  I'm impressed by how well populated
[8447.10 - 8450.10] P:1942.88 E:0.080099 |  Kort-Philippe Chatriet is tonight with the PSG excitement,
[8450.10 - 8453.10] P:1761.46 E:0.081864 |  but the most excitement is for Novak Djokovic
[8453.10 - 8456.10] P:1859.23 E:0.081287 |  because he's looking in pretty much cruise control on the court,
[8456.10 - 8459.10] P:1551.70 E:0.083444 |  where he won as a lucive Olympic gold medal last season,
[8459.10 - 8462.10] P:1731.30 E:0.085171 |  serve unbroken so far on this humid night in Paris,
[8462.10 - 8465.10] P:1780.32 E:0.087973 |  despite some entertaining court-craft from the Austrian qualifier,
[8465.10 - 8468.10] P:1751.68 E:0.087487 |  Philippe Misalich, and it is the three-time tournament champion,
[8468.10 - 8473.10] P:1861.40 E:0.081965 |  Djokovic, with a point for a two sets to love lead on the main stage.
[8474.10 - 8478.10] P:1761.56 E:0.077050 |  Sion from the British players who have been in action this afternoon.
[8478.10 - 8481.10] P:1665.26 E:0.078506 |  Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie both threw to the fourth round
[8481.10 - 8483.10] P:1836.04 E:0.080203 |  for the first time, actually both did it in straight sets.
[8483.10 - 8485.10] P:1792.72 E:0.080215 |  Draper Beach, Welfare and Secker,
[8485.10 - 8487.10] P:1791.82 E:0.077010 |  we can hear from Cam Norrie,
[8487.10 - 8489.10] P:1964.93 E:0.072275 |  who came through beating his fellow Brit Jacob Ferdley.
[8489.10 - 8493.10] P:1642.56 E:0.081411 |  I feel great, but it's not really tough to get there.
[8493.10 - 8495.10] P:1636.46 E:0.068011 |  It was a tough match.
[8495.10 - 8499.10] P:1642.99 E:0.079106 |  Playing Jacob today, we both went to the same university at TCU,
[8499.10 - 8502.10] P:1776.28 E:0.081218 |  and he's had an amazing season, amazing breakthrough
[8502.10 - 8504.10] P:1744.83 E:0.101393 |  in the tour, so I was just really happy.
[8504.10 - 8507.10] P:1893.63 E:0.079430 |  I played a solid match, and I was a bit tempted towards the end,
[8507.10 - 8509.10] P:1843.66 E:0.078588 |  but it was a great atmosphere,
[8509.10 - 8513.10] P:1769.66 E:0.066029 |  and I went through about seven shirts and two sets,
[8513.10 - 8515.10] P:1701.94 E:0.071425 |  they were all three sets,
[8515.10 - 8517.10] P:1820.26 E:0.088764 |  so sweating a lot and I had to work really hard for that,
[8517.10 - 8519.10] P:1732.61 E:0.067617 |  so it really felt good.
[8519.10 - 8521.10] P:1688.29 E:0.117067 |  Are you a big football fan?
[8521.10 - 8523.10] P:1874.76 E:0.100048 |  You're going to try and soak in a little bit of the atmosphere tonight?
[8523.10 - 8525.10] P:1867.81 E:0.076975 |  Absolutely, yeah, so it will be a good match,
[8525.10 - 8528.10] P:1678.78 E:0.075654 |  and actually it's been nice to see PSG win it.
[8528.10 - 8531.10] P:1749.65 E:0.069442 |  Well, that's what it looks like.
[8531.10 - 8533.10] P:1939.99 E:0.097907 |  It looks like it's going to happen at the moment, isn't it?
[8533.10 - 8537.10] P:1921.38 E:0.081267 |  Paris Saint-Germain leading into 2-0 in the Champions League final.
[8537.10 - 8539.10] P:2175.91 E:0.099021 |  Players actually are just emerging.
[8539.10 - 8543.10] P:1909.79 E:0.075466 |  They emerge from effectively underground at the Allianz Arena,
[8543.10 - 8546.10] P:1666.47 E:0.085434 |  a little trapdoor opens and they pop up out of it,
[8546.10 - 8548.10] P:2047.27 E:0.083637 |  so they'll be doing that in the next few seconds.
[8548.10 - 8551.10] P:1852.65 E:0.086429 |  By the way, there's live F1 commentary of the Spanish Grand Prix
[8551.10 - 8553.10] P:1730.94 E:0.083735 |  from 2 o'clock tomorrow on 5 Live.
[8553.10 - 8555.10] P:1667.20 E:0.080127 |  McLaren have got a front row lockout.
[8555.10 - 8559.10] P:1707.70 E:0.084397 |  Oscar Piazzari, the world champion, starts first ahead of Lando Norris.
[8559.10 - 8564.10] P:1797.60 E:0.076405 |  You'll be able to get reaction on BBC Sounds via the Checkered Flag podcast.
[8564.10 - 8566.10] P:1971.38 E:0.079673 |  Right, almost ready to go.
[8566.10 - 8569.10] P:1906.77 E:0.075861 |  I just looked to my right-hand side thinking I might ask somebody a question,
[8569.10 - 8571.10] P:1925.91 E:0.095310 |  and then I realised that everybody was eating bananas.
[8571.10 - 8575.10] P:1698.65 E:0.071961 |  So, Chris Sutton, what do you think they can do in this second half
[8575.10 - 8578.10] P:1854.81 E:0.094447 |  into obviously they need to score and score early,
[8578.10 - 8581.10] P:1713.08 E:0.075473 |  but can they do that while playing the same way?
[8581.10 - 8583.10] P:1760.22 E:0.080790 |  Well, obviously not.
[8583.10 - 8587.10] P:1812.28 E:0.089609 |  I mean, first of all, they have to try and get an element of control back into this game,
[8587.10 - 8589.10] P:1857.40 E:0.100138 |  but it's all about the next goal,
[8589.10 - 8594.10] P:1697.39 E:0.086993 |  and I'm sure that Simone and Zaghi would have emphasised that.
[8594.10 - 8598.10] P:1837.99 E:0.088165 |  It'll be interesting to see whether he's made a substitution or two,
[8598.10 - 8602.10] P:1804.80 E:0.087973 |  but the fact of the matter is, is PSG have smothered them.
[8602.10 - 8606.10] P:1870.31 E:0.099123 |  So, whether it's going a little bit more direct, which I don't mind,
[8606.10 - 8608.10] P:1965.79 E:0.098767 |  so it's two on two at the back,
[8608.10 - 8613.10] P:1799.03 E:0.091089 |  and maybe the two strikers coming up with a bit of combination play,
[8613.10 - 8616.10] P:1797.11 E:0.088555 |  but at this moment in time, if PSG get the next goal,
[8616.10 - 8618.10] P:1788.48 E:0.052762 |  it's curtains.
[8618.10 - 8622.10] P:1745.83 E:0.078428 |  Well, it is, and we've got a big 45 minutes to come then.
[8622.10 - 8624.10] P:1900.21 E:0.091396 |  I am going to be very busy indeed,
[8624.10 - 8627.10] P:1820.15 E:0.090741 |  acting as Julianne LeRon's emotional support cushion,
[8627.10 - 8630.10] P:1710.08 E:0.075322 |  while John Murray commentates on the Champions League final.
[8630.10 - 8632.10] P:1814.33 E:0.101065 |  Yes, I've been watching the interplayers,
[8632.10 - 8635.10] P:1870.69 E:0.078851 |  where we've seen pictures of them coming down the steps,
[8635.10 - 8637.10] P:1910.16 E:0.101732 |  and now we can see them all.
[8637.10 - 8640.10] P:1961.50 E:0.091391 |  I'll just say no thanks, we don't have any water at the moment.
[8640.10 - 8645.10] P:2004.00 E:0.089840 |  And Bastoni and Achirbi
[8645.10 - 8649.10] P:1821.37 E:0.085794 |  are all there, I'm not sure I can see any players that weren't out there,
[8649.10 - 8651.10] P:1767.65 E:0.095990 |  McIntyreians out there as well.
[8651.10 - 8653.10] P:1606.24 E:0.081943 |  Looks like it's them again, Chris, to me.
[8653.10 - 8658.10] P:1684.93 E:0.084277 |  Yeah, you know, he's given them the opportunity, Simone and Zaghi,
[8658.10 - 8661.10] P:1769.84 E:0.082074 |  the opportunity to try and put things right really.
[8661.10 - 8666.10] P:1782.20 E:0.085537 |  It was such an insipid display in that first half.
[8666.10 - 8670.10] P:1849.71 E:0.088477 |  It was a fear about them really, and it was the younger, hungrier.
[8670.10 - 8672.10] P:1740.34 E:0.089537 |  How much was that PSG though?
[8672.10 - 8673.10] P:1629.26 E:0.090759 |  Yeah, no, exactly.
[8673.10 - 8677.10] P:1867.85 E:0.084643 |  And I suppose the question is, can PSG keep up this intensity,
[8677.10 - 8680.10] P:1656.71 E:0.088593 |  but the fact that you look at their average age,
[8680.10 - 8683.10] P:1685.98 E:0.076831 |  compared to Winters, I suspect they can.
[8683.10 - 8686.10] P:1495.58 E:0.101765 |  Can they keep up this intensity while having seen them
[8686.10 - 8689.10] P:1462.10 E:0.099097 |  keep up the intensity against Manchester City,
[8689.10 - 8691.10] P:1363.83 E:0.098268 |  keep up the intensity against Liverpool,
[8691.10 - 8693.10] P:1448.30 E:0.102703 |  keep up the intensity against Aston Villa,
[8693.10 - 8695.10] P:1616.20 E:0.119374 |  keep up the intensity against Arsenal.
[8696.10 - 8700.10] P:1532.56 E:0.083472 |  I think they might be able to, but we will see.
[8700.10 - 8707.10] P:1703.01 E:0.085978 |  As referee Istvan Kovac gets the second half underway here in Munich,
[8707.10 - 8710.10] P:1684.22 E:0.094165 |  with 70,000 people watching down,
[8710.10 - 8714.10] P:1624.44 E:0.087592 |  darkness has descended in Bavaria above our heads,
[8714.10 - 8721.10] P:1605.25 E:0.087149 |  and it is Inter in the golden yellow kit with the blue trim,
[8721.10 - 8726.10] P:1630.47 E:0.092305 |  who tried to play it forward, but he has due pass forward,
[8726.10 - 8728.10] P:1715.12 E:0.089361 |  Flick from Dan Ballet, Fabian Nouriz,
[8728.10 - 8731.10] P:1718.07 E:0.104878 |  Kravitz-Kalias into action, he's in the box now,
[8731.10 - 8736.10] P:1638.41 E:0.099449 |  and he shoots from the angle wide of the top left corner.
[8736.10 - 8739.10] P:1546.82 E:0.110500 |  We've seen that goal already for him this season, haven't we?
[8739.10 - 8743.10] P:1526.11 E:0.093209 |  Planting it into the top corner at this time, just wide.
[8743.10 - 8747.10] P:1535.24 E:0.100639 |  They are so slick, do a ball fit into Dan Ballet,
[8747.10 - 8752.10] P:1399.48 E:0.099685 |  little back heel, Scalier onto it, driving into the box,
[8752.10 - 8757.10] P:1379.40 E:0.094676 |  and their foot at effort, high and wide, from a cute angle.
[8757.10 - 8760.10] P:1677.15 E:0.093551 |  Inter take this goal kick, and this is right in front of us,
[8760.10 - 8763.10] P:1613.66 E:0.099818 |  because our country position is halfway inside one half.
[8763.10 - 8766.10] P:1452.53 E:0.093073 |  Dan Ballet was like an Olympic sprinter,
[8766.10 - 8769.10] P:1652.52 E:0.096984 |  waiting on his blocks on the edge of the area for Summer
[8769.10 - 8772.10] P:1644.34 E:0.088137 |  to take that short goal kick, and then he was off sprinting,
[8772.10 - 8774.10] P:1669.24 E:0.090013 |  trying to put this press on them.
[8774.10 - 8778.10] P:1545.80 E:0.096185 |  Inter with Martinez, I'll run you through the teams in full again,
[8778.10 - 8780.10] P:1589.08 E:0.092964 |  but it is as we started the match,
[8780.10 - 8782.10] P:1568.00 E:0.094779 |  he saw the teams or heard the teams earlier,
[8782.10 - 8785.10] P:1403.40 E:0.094894 |  he has two Ram, son of the great Lillian two Ram,
[8785.10 - 8787.10] P:1599.08 E:0.096037 |  the world cup winner, never won the Champions League.
[8787.10 - 8790.10] P:1619.16 E:0.110997 |  He has two Ram again, gets it back, then a maniola,
[8790.10 - 8793.10] P:1650.01 E:0.103244 |  and comes the challenge from Pacho, down goes two Ram,
[8793.10 - 8796.10] P:1753.48 E:0.097866 |  wins the free kick, and Inter have a set piece on the right.
[8796.10 - 8801.10] P:1643.89 E:0.091367 |  Yeah, and they caused problems for PSG from a couple of corners,
[8801.10 - 8804.10] P:1706.40 E:0.096309 |  so Darf free kick to give away from Pacho,
[8804.10 - 8808.10] P:1585.09 E:0.091417 |  little bit too keen to make the challenge on two Ram,
[8808.10 - 8811.10] P:1511.43 E:0.084434 |  so maybe this is a moment.
[8811.10 - 8814.10] P:1691.95 E:0.108156 |  So this is five-lie, this is the genuine sound
[8814.10 - 8818.10] P:1595.78 E:0.097634 |  from inside the stadium here in Munich on five-lie,
[8818.10 - 8821.10] P:1660.03 E:0.096559 |  and the World Service from the BBC,
[8821.10 - 8823.10] P:1577.48 E:0.104865 |  listening wherever you are around the globe
[8823.10 - 8827.10] P:1628.06 E:0.099785 |  to one of the great sporting events of any year.
[8827.10 - 8830.10] P:1732.33 E:0.098537 |  And at the moment, this is in PSG's hands,
[8830.10 - 8834.10] P:1667.42 E:0.101242 |  but Chalannolo takes the free kick, and he gets that all wrong,
[8834.10 - 8836.10] P:1639.51 E:0.102083 |  kills it over everyone inside the box,
[8836.10 - 8838.10] P:1547.94 E:0.098422 |  whether in a blue shirt of Paris,
[8838.10 - 8841.10] P:1359.00 E:0.097745 |  or a yellow shirt of Inter, and it bounces behind Inter golfing.
[8841.10 - 8846.10] P:1584.16 E:0.097511 |  That's incredible. That free kick, whipped in,
[8846.10 - 8849.10] P:1663.85 E:0.095027 |  15-20 yards beyond the far post,
[8849.10 - 8851.10] P:1825.34 E:0.101280 |  just when you need that bit of quality,
[8851.10 - 8856.10] P:1565.06 E:0.093712 |  that sums up Inter's evening so far, pretty much perfectly.
[8858.10 - 8862.10] P:1557.34 E:0.104143 |  Luis Enrique looks as calm as it's possible today
[8862.10 - 8866.10] P:1499.52 E:0.095728 |  in these circumstances, for a man with such energy,
[8866.10 - 8870.10] P:1561.42 E:0.095877 |  he's very casually dressed in black, black T-shirt,
[8870.10 - 8873.10] P:1507.22 E:0.106470 |  Simone and Zaghi looks as though he's got an appointment
[8873.10 - 8876.10] P:1578.23 E:0.086795 |  with the bank manager, and he steps forward
[8876.10 - 8879.10] P:1620.59 E:0.099563 |  and he traps his hands again, trying to urge his team on.
[8879.10 - 8882.10] P:1322.24 E:0.096295 |  He's interested in James Horncastle's things before the match,
[8882.10 - 8886.10] P:1538.78 E:0.093207 |  that this offer, this reported offer from Al Hillal
[8886.10 - 8890.10] P:1609.94 E:0.103116 |  would make him for the richest manager in world football.
[8890.10 - 8893.10] P:1599.32 E:0.097448 |  And hence why you might have to have a meeting with his bank manager.
[8893.10 - 8895.10] P:1480.47 E:0.095526 |  Yeah, I would have thought if you get a job like that,
[8895.10 - 8898.10] P:1595.12 E:0.090699 |  you don't need to have a manager, you need to be a bank manager.
[8898.10 - 8902.10] P:1527.89 E:0.093873 |  Here's Martinez, Martinez now, slipping a pass out to Varela.
[8902.10 - 8905.10] P:1590.36 E:0.102023 |  Varela curls it in, Turan tries to take it down,
[8905.10 - 8909.10] P:1714.64 E:0.101665 |  Hakimi had to be careful, and in the end, he headed up behind Donnaroma.
[8909.10 - 8913.10] P:1757.57 E:0.103940 |  He wasn't sure where DiMarco was behind him. DiMarco picks the ball up,
[8913.10 - 8916.10] P:1680.17 E:0.095293 |  races towards the corner fly, it's urgency now.
[8916.10 - 8919.10] P:1738.46 E:0.096834 |  Chris Sutton's talked about the importance of this next goal,
[8919.10 - 8923.10] P:1829.70 E:0.082409 |  and Inter know it's got to be them who score it.
[8923.10 - 8927.10] P:1862.11 E:0.101913 |  Chalannolo runs away, DiMarco takes it, DiMarco to the near post,
[8927.10 - 8930.10] P:1808.05 E:0.097566 |  dances down, still in the PSG box, scrambled away,
[8930.10 - 8934.10] P:1710.88 E:0.096391 |  out to McIterri in the referee, spotted an infringement.
[8934.10 - 8938.10] P:1844.11 E:0.104987 |  I think Simone and Zaghi actually, in his technical area,
[8938.10 - 8941.10] P:1628.46 E:0.095545 |  screaming for a penalty for Anbole for Inter.
[8941.10 - 8944.10] P:1723.69 E:0.098945 |  It looks like the call has gone the other way.
[8944.10 - 8946.10] P:1570.02 E:0.065522 |  Well, they'll have a look.
[8946.10 - 8951.10] P:1638.53 E:0.106055 |  I mean, from our first look there, it's hit the body of Marquinhos.
[8951.10 - 8954.10] P:1331.25 E:0.096178 |  As opposed to the arm, what do you think?
[8954.10 - 8956.10] P:1496.85 E:0.084570 |  Yeah, I thought so.
[8957.10 - 8964.10] P:1402.35 E:0.095577 |  So, it is a pre-kick to PSG.
[8964.10 - 8969.10] P:1518.49 E:0.097042 |  The fourth official tonight is Portuguese, actually,
[8969.10 - 8973.10] P:1474.32 E:0.098324 |  and the video assistant referee is from the Netherlands,
[8973.10 - 8976.10] P:1520.24 E:0.084208 |  so they are not all from the same country.
[8976.10 - 8980.10] P:1481.59 E:0.098161 |  Referee and assistant from Romania, but the VAR is Dennis Biegler.
[8980.10 - 8982.10] P:1575.53 E:0.094257 |  Here is Kavaret's Kaelia.
[8982.10 - 8986.10] P:1732.18 E:0.100415 |  On the move down the left-hand side, Fabio Ruiz is ball across the...
[8986.10 - 8987.10] P:1889.93 E:0.110032 |  Kavaret's Kaelia!
[8987.10 - 8989.10] P:1488.42 E:0.096758 |  Shuts wide!
[8989.10 - 8991.10] P:1495.95 E:0.101756 |  That was a big opening.
[8991.10 - 8994.10] P:1509.10 E:0.084943 |  Bastogne was down.
[8994.10 - 8999.10] P:1587.75 E:0.094834 |  He was stretching for it, but he couldn't direct the shot into the top corner.
[8999.10 - 9003.10] P:1611.28 E:0.092908 |  No, and should have scored. That should have been the match right there.
[9003.10 - 9006.10] P:1233.16 E:0.098625 |  Scalia, what an opportunity.
[9006.10 - 9008.10] P:1631.59 E:0.113691 |  Ruiz with the pullback.
[9008.10 - 9012.10] P:1590.69 E:0.095486 |  Think about having a derby, actually, who was down,
[9012.10 - 9017.10] P:1630.09 E:0.096127 |  but maybe he did enough on the floor just to put Marquinhos Kaelia off.
[9017.10 - 9020.10] P:1703.16 E:0.093917 |  He took a touch and once again high and wide,
[9020.10 - 9023.10] P:1520.44 E:0.078744 |  six yards out from the point of the six-yard line.
[9025.10 - 9028.10] P:1595.37 E:0.086584 |  PSG 2, Inter, 0.
[9028.10 - 9032.10] P:1492.89 E:0.091133 |  That's been the scoreline since the 20th minute of the match.
[9032.10 - 9034.10] P:1641.45 E:0.110763 |  If you weren't with us in the first period,
[9034.10 - 9038.10] P:1606.06 E:0.091662 |  PSG went off like a bullet a gate, really.
[9038.10 - 9041.10] P:1596.86 E:0.094873 |  They were just too much, they were too hot to handle.
[9041.10 - 9046.10] P:1529.57 E:0.094678 |  I must say, Chris, it was, to me, watching so much Manchester City
[9046.10 - 9050.10] P:1307.78 E:0.099646 |  over the course of recent times, when Manchester City have really been in the groove
[9050.10 - 9053.10] P:1294.74 E:0.097774 |  and they've set their sights on starting off powerfully,
[9053.10 - 9055.10] P:1609.27 E:0.097916 |  that's what it reminded me of.
[9055.10 - 9059.10] P:1668.84 E:0.104588 |  But this is Luis Enrique's team, not Pet Guardiola's team,
[9059.10 - 9061.10] P:1589.66 E:0.095975 |  and PSG passing it forward again.
[9061.10 - 9063.10] P:1509.35 E:0.091468 |  Fabio Ruiz, Fabio Ruiz turns.
[9063.10 - 9064.10] P:1792.35 E:0.089973 |  Slips it to his left.
[9064.10 - 9067.10] P:1651.55 E:0.101101 |  Dembele Kirling across the face of goal.
[9067.10 - 9069.10] P:1607.70 E:0.098517 |  Didn't get enough curl on it by any distance.
[9069.10 - 9071.10] P:1648.80 E:0.086112 |  Actually, he wanted to draw it in,
[9071.10 - 9074.10] P:1528.11 E:0.105562 |  but it just cut its line beyond the far post.
[9074.10 - 9076.10] P:1643.00 E:0.102577 |  Dembele getting that opportunity, John,
[9076.10 - 9078.10] P:1673.78 E:0.097942 |  that was because he shut Yan Somerdown.
[9078.10 - 9081.10] P:1454.20 E:0.101758 |  Hurry clearance up the park, went to Mendes,
[9081.10 - 9084.10] P:1531.39 E:0.097832 |  quick ball into Ruiz, fed Dembele.
[9084.10 - 9088.10] P:1455.73 E:0.091421 |  You're half fancy him in that position, drifting in on his right foot,
[9088.10 - 9090.10] P:1541.69 E:0.101357 |  trying to bend the ball into that far corner.
[9090.10 - 9093.10] P:1398.30 E:0.084227 |  But their intensity out of possession,
[9093.10 - 9096.10] P:1404.28 E:0.094430 |  they just do not stop running.
[9096.10 - 9099.10] P:1517.17 E:0.092596 |  They have out-worked into, haven't they?
[9099.10 - 9103.10] P:1556.29 E:0.086975 |  Yeah, and there's been an immense amount of talk and written about Dembele
[9103.10 - 9107.10] P:1494.47 E:0.097873 |  being left out by Luis Enrique when they went to the Emirates to Arsenal
[9107.10 - 9113.10] P:1529.68 E:0.093443 |  in the league phase, and it was all to do, apparently, with his work for the team.
[9113.10 - 9116.10] P:1547.82 E:0.099586 |  Well, my goodness, he's got his act together on that front.
[9116.10 - 9118.10] P:1630.60 E:0.092681 |  Dembele, hasn't he?
[9118.10 - 9121.10] P:1469.30 E:0.103994 |  What a team man he is, providing the goals as well,
[9121.10 - 9125.10] P:1527.44 E:0.098979 |  and he was talking about him as being a leader for this team, Dembele,
[9125.10 - 9130.10] P:1577.52 E:0.103274 |  as PSG win another free kick, ten yards inside their own half
[9130.10 - 9137.10] P:1378.40 E:0.102233 |  after DiMarco was in tight there and committing the foul on Hakimi.
[9137.10 - 9140.10] P:1562.23 E:0.111443 |  Apparently, the UEFA statistics, Chris,
[9140.10 - 9145.10] P:1634.60 E:0.101170 |  say that Inter have run four kilometres more than Paris Saint-Germain
[9145.10 - 9147.10] P:1517.34 E:0.087085 |  as a team just now.
[9147.10 - 9151.10] P:1401.54 E:0.098904 |  Yeah, it's not how far you run, it's how you run, though, John.
[9151.10 - 9155.10] P:1434.27 E:0.095846 |  Yeah, it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it.
[9155.10 - 9158.10] P:1578.64 E:0.093408 |  Yeah, I just got my straws out there.
[9158.10 - 9162.10] P:1460.95 E:0.090423 |  It's Inter, winner, free kick on the right-hand side.
[9162.10 - 9164.10] P:1693.98 E:0.098538 |  Well, he is going to make a couple of changes,
[9164.10 - 9167.10] P:1417.06 E:0.101009 |  Simone and Zaghi with almost eight minutes played in the second half.
[9167.10 - 9173.10] P:1594.13 E:0.084237 |  So, he's going to take off Pavard,
[9174.10 - 9177.10] P:1653.89 E:0.098459 |  who has missed the last six matches.
[9177.10 - 9181.10] P:1894.38 E:0.099973 |  So, Jan Bisak is going to come on to replace him,
[9181.10 - 9187.10] P:1966.21 E:0.100571 |  and the other change will see DiMarco coming off, Federico DiMarco,
[9187.10 - 9196.10] P:1762.23 E:0.088269 |  who will be replaced by the Polish international, Nicola Zalewski.
[9196.10 - 9198.10] P:1718.11 E:0.099238 |  So, double change.
[9198.10 - 9202.10] P:1696.37 E:0.100192 |  Chalonola takes this free kick in, and Dona Roma came and didn't get there,
[9202.10 - 9206.10] P:1755.93 E:0.105912 |  and it came off a defender's head, or possibly Dona Roma himself
[9206.10 - 9209.10] P:1875.76 E:0.096961 |  deflected up and over his own crossbar.
[9209.10 - 9212.10] P:1680.95 E:0.100650 |  Chirby was in for Inter, and Dona Roma's ended up on the ground,
[9212.10 - 9215.10] P:1524.88 E:0.087393 |  but I'm not sure he got there at all, Chris.
[9215.10 - 9220.10] P:1344.75 E:0.095993 |  He's still down, Dona Roma.
[9220.10 - 9224.10] P:1486.55 E:0.092392 |  There's a ball fizzed in, Dona Roma goes to punch,
[9224.10 - 9228.10] P:1774.72 E:0.094722 |  Kaleida, Marquinhos, it is, coming together.
[9228.10 - 9232.10] P:1587.83 E:0.096965 |  Chirby can't quite get the flick, Dona Roma back on his feet.
[9234.10 - 9236.10] P:1622.36 E:0.108443 |  PSG with some defending to do.
[9237.10 - 9240.10] P:1727.80 E:0.102325 |  I assume that it's not a problem, an injury problem for DiMarco,
[9240.10 - 9242.10] P:1702.90 E:0.096787 |  so what a disappointment that is for him.
[9242.10 - 9246.10] P:1819.59 E:0.103601 |  Here is the next corner, Dona Roma comes, flaps at it, it bounces out,
[9246.10 - 9251.10] P:1729.66 E:0.083512 |  it's drilled across the box by the newly...
[9253.10 - 9257.10] P:1641.25 E:0.104712 |  As it bounces all the way to the other end to Soma, who's able to turn it away.
[9258.10 - 9263.10] P:1617.88 E:0.088044 |  The chance on the edge of the box for Inter, the shot across goal,
[9263.10 - 9267.10] P:1525.99 E:0.085983 |  which was deflected away and then cleared away,
[9267.10 - 9271.10] P:1562.72 E:0.098095 |  downfield by Paris Saint-Germain, remains 2-0,
[9271.10 - 9274.10] P:1608.68 E:0.100245 |  but a couple of alarms there for Paris Saint-Germain,
[9274.10 - 9278.10] P:1605.86 E:0.091246 |  one for Dembele, to chase Bissec, is able to turn it back to Soma,
[9278.10 - 9280.10] P:1583.02 E:0.085705 |  who gets rid of it quickly on his right foot,
[9280.10 - 9285.10] P:1606.19 E:0.095373 |  towards the centre circle, Barela's after that.
[9285.10 - 9289.10] P:1586.24 E:0.095465 |  Now there's more energy from Inter, Lautaro Martinez, heads it forward,
[9289.10 - 9292.10] P:1713.35 E:0.096363 |  Barela just outside the edge of the penalty area,
[9292.10 - 9294.10] P:1572.51 E:0.094382 |  there's the overlap to the left-hand side,
[9294.10 - 9297.10] P:1722.84 E:0.104931 |  cutting infield, the shot initially is blocked,
[9297.10 - 9300.10] P:1589.92 E:0.116972 |  that's the newly arrived Zalewski with the effort inside the area,
[9300.10 - 9305.10] P:1732.62 E:0.102422 |  and with that second effort, he actually caught the defender
[9305.10 - 9310.10] P:1719.21 E:0.091882 |  and has committed the foul and it's a free kick to PSG on the edge of their own box.
[9310.10 - 9314.10] P:1640.16 E:0.102681 |  Yes, Soma's actually coming inside, not on his right foot,
[9314.10 - 9319.10] P:1683.42 E:0.092562 |  Nevers gets the first block in his attempt to retrieve the ball.
[9319.10 - 9324.10] P:1500.02 E:0.098935 |  Catches, I think, Fabian Ruiz,
[9324.10 - 9329.10] P:1624.44 E:0.097554 |  only gives him a bit of impetus, a bit of drive down that left-hand side,
[9329.10 - 9332.10] P:1398.16 E:0.083549 |  Zalewski.
[9332.10 - 9337.10] P:1529.52 E:0.099747 |  So a little stoppage here, PSG after the Fabian Ruiz just gets to his feet,
[9337.10 - 9342.10] P:1477.26 E:0.098108 |  the score, PSG 2, Inter at 0, Hakimi and Due the goal scorers,
[9342.10 - 9347.10] P:1555.26 E:0.100135 |  Due setting up the goal for Hakimi and then shooting in via a deflection off DiMarco,
[9347.10 - 9356.10] P:1790.94 E:0.091448 |  and as I say, Federico DiMarco, who as James Horncastle was saying on FIED LIVE at half-time,
[9356.10 - 9363.10] P:1640.01 E:0.092892 |  he's an Inter fan born in Milan, would be in the stands watching Inter,
[9363.10 - 9367.10] P:1641.84 E:0.101117 |  son of a green drosa, he is a Milan green drosa,
[9367.10 - 9372.10] P:1547.06 E:0.088316 |  the club means so much to them and here he is, Champions League final,
[9372.10 - 9377.10] P:1512.47 E:0.094370 |  they lost two years ago, now they're facing defeat for a second time in three years
[9377.10 - 9381.10] P:1403.08 E:0.090874 |  and he's been substituted, and maybe an issue we don't know,
[9381.10 - 9386.10] P:1409.08 E:0.088629 |  but Zalewski coming on to replace him,
[9386.10 - 9392.10] P:1353.43 E:0.096376 |  PSG serenaded by the drums of the French supporters,
[9392.10 - 9398.10] P:1537.84 E:0.088854 |  the ball passed from deep into the penalty area, the somers able to clear,
[9398.10 - 9402.10] P:1666.91 E:0.100312 |  now a turn by Turan, went between two French defenders,
[9402.10 - 9407.10] P:1849.71 E:0.102054 |  Paco and Zalewski, there's between them, they sandwiched Turan, that's a free kick,
[9407.10 - 9415.10] P:1749.01 E:0.091896 |  near the centre, and referee Kovac has been called across to speak to someone,
[9415.10 - 9420.10] P:1610.48 E:0.088702 |  I think, on the Inter bench, and he's calling for it,
[9420.10 - 9425.10] P:1696.18 E:0.101087 |  Simone and Zargi, and it's a yellow card for Simone and Zargi,
[9425.10 - 9432.10] P:1759.81 E:0.094063 |  meanwhile, ten yards to the left, Luis Enrique is going absolutely crazy about something,
[9432.10 - 9437.10] P:1385.01 E:0.083537 |  who's he talking to, it's one of the, it might be Dembele,
[9437.10 - 9440.10] P:1722.99 E:0.105171 |  I think it was the player furthest forward anyway,
[9440.10 - 9444.10] P:1632.36 E:0.094774 |  yellow card for Simone, something he said rather amusingly,
[9444.10 - 9448.10] P:1525.28 E:0.091657 |  he disappeared quickly and sat down, and had to be beckoned out by referee Kovac
[9448.10 - 9453.10] P:1662.21 E:0.075425 |  to be shown the yellow card, free kick for Inter,
[9453.10 - 9457.10] P:1459.08 E:0.089710 |  as they play from left to right, both teams now attacking towards the end
[9457.10 - 9462.10] P:1394.57 E:0.085940 |  where the bulk of their supporters are, they win themselves another throw,
[9462.10 - 9470.10] P:1589.19 E:0.095424 |  down that left flank, that will be hurled in from deep, from level with the edge
[9470.10 - 9474.10] P:1699.07 E:0.103619 |  of the PSG penalty area, there have been a couple of uncertain moments
[9474.10 - 9480.10] P:1536.83 E:0.082975 |  for Donnarumma, already in this second half, the PSG leading as they are 2-0,
[9480.10 - 9483.10] P:1693.40 E:0.099619 |  here is the long throw, Mokinius gets up, heads it down,
[9483.10 - 9487.10] P:1641.48 E:0.100801 |  bounces out to the edge of the area where Varela controlled it,
[9487.10 - 9493.10] P:1816.82 E:0.089285 |  just pumped it over the top of the crossbar on the volley, and threw for a goal kick.
[9493.10 - 9498.10] P:1721.34 E:0.096128 |  No, I didn't take that first time, Mokinius I think with a header,
[9498.10 - 9501.10] P:1693.19 E:0.099719 |  and the ball just bouncing, it did bounce up a little bit,
[9501.10 - 9504.10] P:1822.73 E:0.107245 |  but it's still capable of getting his right hip up nice and high,
[9504.10 - 9509.10] P:1858.13 E:0.088836 |  and getting a shot off, he didn't, took the touch and was closed down, high and wide.
[9509.10 - 9512.10] P:1644.14 E:0.102192 |  That's Chris Sutton with us here in Munich, in the stadium,
[9512.10 - 9517.10] P:1582.75 E:0.090693 |  still commentary position, excellent view of Gerard, it's Kaeli Edges down in front of us,
[9517.10 - 9521.10] P:1525.36 E:0.093999 |  the referee is trying to get Donnarumma to get a move on with things,
[9521.10 - 9527.10] P:1605.16 E:0.078751 |  so he's onto that, as balls fired forward by Varela, comes out,
[9527.10 - 9531.10] P:1673.58 E:0.098567 |  he's not able to keep it in play, but it is a throw-in to, into,
[9531.10 - 9535.10] P:1644.38 E:0.093691 |  Simone and Zargi comes, little tiptoes in his shiny black shoes,
[9535.10 - 9540.10] P:1620.74 E:0.093275 |  all the way along the dotted line of his coaching area to say something to Varela,
[9540.10 - 9543.10] P:1592.09 E:0.092208 |  it's got to be careful otherwise they'll be sent to the stands in the Champions League final.
[9543.10 - 9548.10] P:1671.21 E:0.092405 |  Now Bissec, the central defender is going to take it on, but tried to do too much,
[9548.10 - 9552.10] P:1638.14 E:0.095925 |  he's out of position now, PSG might be able to break, but they can't,
[9552.10 - 9556.10] P:1715.97 E:0.095908 |  and into, come again, having a better spell right now, Zalewski,
[9556.10 - 9559.10] P:1627.91 E:0.093405 |  now to the left-hand side, the ball is deflected across,
[9559.10 - 9564.10] P:1796.68 E:0.098122 |  Donnarumma comes and is able to catch it, much to the relief of those PSG supporters in the stands,
[9564.10 - 9569.10] P:1756.83 E:0.091218 |  to our left, they've brought the virage or toy with them,
[9569.10 - 9574.10] P:1772.52 E:0.087253 |  from the, the Parc de France, I don't know whether you saw all of those white T-shirts outside the ground,
[9574.10 - 9578.10] P:1456.98 E:0.086454 |  and they've got a banner up there as well, that's the popular end at the Parc de France,
[9578.10 - 9583.10] P:1498.36 E:0.085793 |  and they've tried to recreate that inside the stadium here, but,
[9583.10 - 9587.10] P:1418.11 E:0.087715 |  we've got a stoppage because Bissec, after his 1-4, has ended up injured.
[9587.10 - 9594.10] P:1522.38 E:0.088591 |  Yeah, there's a diagonal run from, right centre, half position, deep into the PSG,
[9594.10 - 9600.10] P:1522.50 E:0.094484 |  half of that scaly attract him all the way, won the ball back,
[9600.10 - 9604.10] P:1635.05 E:0.083542 |  and you mentioned John in the first half, that's a, that's a big feature of his game, isn't it?
[9604.10 - 9609.10] P:1498.97 E:0.076376 |  Not just with the ball, with his wizardry dribbling,
[9609.10 - 9612.10] P:1634.68 E:0.086834 |  under the Bissec's holding his hamstring there, which,
[9612.10 - 9618.10] P:1634.15 E:0.092463 |  having changed one of your central defenders already, that would be an issue, wouldn't it?
[9618.10 - 9623.10] P:1556.36 E:0.085289 |  I'm not a medital expert, but I know where the hamstring is, and he's holding it.
[9623.10 - 9628.10] P:1509.68 E:0.096994 |  But, Krover-Scalier, when he's in possession, and here he is now,
[9628.10 - 9632.10] P:1672.55 E:0.106376 |  receiving it from a flick from Dürer, that was wonderful to watch.
[9632.10 - 9638.10] P:1699.73 E:0.098500 |  Hakimi, now, Dan Ballet, back to Hakimi, shoots it all the way across the six-yard box,
[9638.10 - 9642.10] P:1651.30 E:0.102636 |  and Krover-Scalier was waiting on the far side of the penalty area,
[9642.10 - 9645.10] P:1612.55 E:0.113524 |  and if Hakimi had been able to pick him out, that might have been 3-0 as well.
[9645.10 - 9652.10] P:1630.50 E:0.087925 |  Absolutely, all about Dürer though, isn't it? The magic, little twirl and flick.
[9653.10 - 9660.10] P:1667.24 E:0.097513 |  Hakimi goes for the far corner, but do right this evening.
[9660.10 - 9663.10] P:1665.87 E:0.088044 |  It's been absolutely sensational, hasn't it?
[9663.10 - 9666.10] P:1685.39 E:0.101651 |  He has been a joy to watch, and as you say, Chris, a twirl there.
[9666.10 - 9669.10] P:1509.78 E:0.090324 |  Used to say, didn't they, on Saturday nights, give us a twirl?
[9669.10 - 9672.10] P:1529.06 E:0.084300 |  Well, he did, here in Munich.
[9672.10 - 9676.10] P:1555.93 E:0.075386 |  Nunamendes plays it back to Vittinia.
[9676.10 - 9681.10] P:1670.87 E:0.091143 |  Vittinia lifts one in, but over everyone and through, and bounces behind for a goal kick.
[9681.10 - 9686.10] P:1747.27 E:0.092178 |  Another double change for Inter, which sort of gives the impression to me
[9686.10 - 9689.10] P:1738.84 E:0.087738 |  that we're getting towards Panic Stations.
[9689.10 - 9691.10] P:1691.74 E:0.094500 |  He's got to make something happen here.
[9691.10 - 9695.10] P:1835.87 E:0.087664 |  Bissex not coming back on, so that's unfortunate.
[9695.10 - 9700.10] P:1931.18 E:0.096937 |  Yeah, very unfortunate for Inter, and he's been led away over there into the far corner.
[9700.10 - 9707.10] P:1894.80 E:0.093722 |  Therefore, Carlos Augusto has been thrown into the breach,
[9707.10 - 9712.10] P:1826.91 E:0.084786 |  and let's see where he's going to fit in.
[9712.10 - 9717.10] P:1785.56 E:0.098334 |  They're going to have to have a rejig, and Matteo D'Amian has come on as well.
[9717.10 - 9726.10] P:1645.48 E:0.085825 |  So, we've almost got the full house now, haven't we, of the old brigade for Inter,
[9726.10 - 9736.10] P:1488.36 E:0.087184 |  with a chirby on at 37, and goalkeeper Summer at 36, and McIterian at 36.
[9736.10 - 9741.10] P:1388.92 E:0.100073 |  Now D'Amian at 35, the former Manchester United defender.
[9741.10 - 9749.10] P:1274.91 E:0.094459 |  And yeah, Carlos Augusto is on the field, as I mentioned.
[9749.10 - 9753.10] P:1321.88 E:0.094282 |  Yeah, he's gone to the left-wing back roll.
[9753.10 - 9756.10] P:1314.18 E:0.099480 |  So, he's left-winged back.
[9756.10 - 9759.10] P:1445.82 E:0.100031 |  And Pavard had to go off early in the half.
[9759.10 - 9764.10] P:1607.19 E:0.107080 |  DSG now completely changed Inter backline, and Bastoni struggling to get there!
[9764.10 - 9766.10] P:1659.24 E:0.111564 |  He can't get there!
[9766.10 - 9772.10] P:1525.81 E:0.117562 |  It's Dewey, who slips the ball into the bottom corner of the Internet,
[9772.10 - 9779.10] P:1545.16 E:0.117381 |  off comes his shirt, and the teenager stands in front of the stands here in Munich,
[9779.10 - 9784.10] P:1524.72 E:0.114768 |  and checks the adoration of the Paris Saint-Germain supporters.
[9784.10 - 9789.10] P:1488.58 E:0.107329 |  I think the moment may be about to arrive for the French champions.
[9789.10 - 9795.10] P:1454.36 E:0.110222 |  Paris Saint-Germain are inching ever closer to winning the Champions League.
[9795.10 - 9800.10] P:1438.61 E:0.109060 |  Dewey with two goals, and Dewey duo.
[9800.10 - 9806.10] P:1532.88 E:0.106432 |  What a night he's had, he set up the other one, and it's PSG3, Inter nil.
[9806.10 - 9812.10] P:1366.71 E:0.099975 |  The flicks and the tricks, and the finishing. Dewey at the double.
[9812.10 - 9815.10] P:1533.76 E:0.106999 |  He was never going to miss, not the evening he's had.
[9815.10 - 9819.10] P:1492.41 E:0.104012 |  It doesn't matter how many subs Inter make, John, bring on to freshen things up.
[9819.10 - 9824.10] P:1489.46 E:0.095878 |  They've been well beaten. Lovely little flick from Dembele to release Fettini.
[9824.10 - 9831.10] P:1699.41 E:0.092776 |  He just waits his ball to Dewey, who strolls onto it first time, beats Sommer.
[9831.10 - 9835.10] P:1602.90 E:0.092500 |  It is near post, big gap at the near post.
[9835.10 - 9841.10] P:1632.72 E:0.082776 |  No blame really attached to Sommer. It's a composed finish.
[9841.10 - 9845.10] P:1480.25 E:0.087180 |  The finish of a confident young player.
[9845.10 - 9849.10] P:1690.94 E:0.095924 |  Surely this game set match now for PSG.
[9849.10 - 9862.10] P:1576.77 E:0.101415 |  They've been a joy to watch this evening. They've simply blown this old-aging experience into Team Await.
[9862.10 - 9866.10] P:1702.40 E:0.100809 |  It looks as though it's going to be Paris Saint-Germain's night here in Newnich.
[9866.10 - 9872.10] P:1389.04 E:0.105813 |  It looks as though Inter are going to lose in this final for the second time in three seasons.
[9872.10 - 9878.10] P:1460.13 E:0.102334 |  With that, Luis Enrique says, three nil up. What shall we do?
[9878.10 - 9883.10] P:1398.29 E:0.096453 |  How about a bit of Bradley Barcala? How do you like that?
[9883.10 - 9887.10] P:1328.77 E:0.102291 |  That's all you need, isn't it? You're an inter defender.
[9887.10 - 9890.10] P:1603.33 E:0.103931 |  He's almost certainly going to come on. He's played in every match this season,
[9890.10 - 9893.10] P:1490.23 E:0.097771 |  either starting or coming off the bench.
[9893.10 - 9899.10] P:1621.90 E:0.080069 |  No one will want to come off. Not one of this front three.
[9899.10 - 9904.10] P:1757.63 E:0.089235 |  D'Ambele has not scored, but he's played his full part.
[9904.10 - 9910.10] P:1725.28 E:0.088225 |  Inter are trying to come forward, as Dumfries can't reach that.
[9910.10 - 9917.10] P:1491.75 E:0.098790 |  And João Neves just uses his body there to block Dumfries and it ran through for a goal kick.
[9917.10 - 9921.10] P:1299.42 E:0.093884 |  And now we are, Chris. PSG three into nil.
[9921.10 - 9927.10] P:1312.07 E:0.099401 |  And to me, this is right out of the playbook from what we've seen
[9927.10 - 9934.10] P:1337.72 E:0.103210 |  from this Paris Saint-Germain side in the second half of the Champions League season.
[9934.10 - 9942.10] P:1579.73 E:0.100197 |  And it is going to be D'Aziré Douay, who is going to be substituted with 25 minutes to play,
[9942.10 - 9947.10] P:1515.50 E:0.099236 |  having put his thumbprint all over this Champions League final.
[9947.10 - 9954.10] P:1614.56 E:0.100562 |  And this young man, 19-year-old, turns 20 on Tuesday, turns and waves an arm,
[9954.10 - 9958.10] P:1806.16 E:0.102013 |  waves a fist, a fist of celebration towards the PSG players.
[9958.10 - 9961.10] P:1754.20 E:0.100890 |  As he leaves the pitch, is replaced by Bradley Barcala.
[9961.10 - 9963.10] P:1754.49 E:0.099138 |  He's got a massive smile on his face.
[9963.10 - 9966.10] P:1790.91 E:0.105382 |  Luis Enrique says, well done young man.
[9966.10 - 9971.10] P:1712.82 E:0.092664 |  And he goes to take his seat on the bench. What a night, what a job he's done.
[9971.10 - 9974.10] P:1687.67 E:0.104253 |  As in to come forward now, there's a double collision at the near post.
[9974.10 - 9978.10] P:1810.61 E:0.093859 |  Marquinhos was in there, but the ball bounced for PSG
[9978.10 - 9982.10] P:1678.03 E:0.088788 |  as it feels like it is one of those nights where it does.
[9982.10 - 9983.10] P:1748.89 E:0.070444 |  I can't. I can't.
[9983.10 - 9986.10] P:1720.99 E:0.100957 |  I can't believe Luis Enrique has taken Douay off.
[9986.10 - 9988.10] P:1399.39 E:0.109475 |  He's been the best player on the park.
[9988.10 - 9993.10] P:1661.52 E:0.095783 |  I suppose Barcala going on, he was always going to get some part to play in this game.
[9993.10 - 9997.10] P:1383.18 E:0.088085 |  And he's, you said it, not a bad replacement at all.
[9997.10 - 10001.10] P:1622.85 E:0.097403 |  Yeah, is replaced the man who scored 15 goals this season
[10001.10 - 10005.10] P:1556.59 E:0.091237 |  with a man who scored 21 goals this season.
[10005.10 - 10006.10] P:1336.31 E:0.092863 |  Barcala.
[10006.10 - 10011.10] P:1472.10 E:0.101380 |  And incidentally, that goal there, that third goal to Paris Saint-Germain
[10011.10 - 10019.10] P:1542.23 E:0.100169 |  brought up 150 goals in all competitions for PSG this season.
[10019.10 - 10024.10] P:1485.04 E:0.102595 |  36 of them in the Champions League.
[10024.10 - 10028.10] P:1536.73 E:0.098663 |  They've been my team of the season in this competition.
[10028.10 - 10031.10] P:1448.68 E:0.107117 |  Well, I mean, you know, talk about doing it the hard way,
[10031.10 - 10033.10] P:1492.21 E:0.095734 |  getting to this final.
[10033.10 - 10035.10] P:1509.01 E:0.094607 |  I'll say it's such a struggle at the start.
[10035.10 - 10038.10] P:1483.95 E:0.112621 |  There's a head scratcher really, but it's not how you start, John.
[10038.10 - 10040.10] P:1515.81 E:0.082230 |  It's how you finish.
[10040.10 - 10042.10] P:1590.96 E:0.096923 |  What have they put on a show tonight?
[10042.10 - 10046.10] P:1361.17 E:0.083464 |  It's not how you start, it's how you finish.
[10046.10 - 10052.10] P:1734.28 E:0.101084 |  And by Jolth, they are finishing brilliantly here.
[10052.10 - 10056.10] P:1731.57 E:0.104818 |  For a performance in a final like this, when the pressure's on,
[10056.10 - 10058.10] P:1614.74 E:0.100168 |  this is something else, isn't it, to be able to come out
[10058.10 - 10060.10] P:1536.31 E:0.093512 |  and do what they've done tonight.
[10060.10 - 10063.10] P:1657.43 E:0.085926 |  That is the ultimate testament to what they've done.
[10063.10 - 10068.10] P:1608.73 E:0.097768 |  Against a really street-wise quality interteam.
[10068.10 - 10070.10] P:1622.58 E:0.095117 |  And that's been a feature of PSG's play,
[10070.10 - 10073.10] P:1533.13 E:0.093401 |  Dembele just drifting off the back line
[10073.10 - 10075.10] P:1519.95 E:0.110213 |  in a little overload in the midfield
[10075.10 - 10078.10] P:1618.20 E:0.101101 |  and just popping the ball off and going to show for it again.
[10078.10 - 10081.10] P:1410.58 E:0.097754 |  They just haven't been able to cope into it, really,
[10081.10 - 10085.10] P:1382.88 E:0.095767 |  with the way that they've interchanged and combined and moved.
[10089.10 - 10094.10] P:1437.86 E:0.096773 |  PSG, with the jubilant backdrop of the songs
[10094.10 - 10097.10] P:1339.13 E:0.106769 |  of the Paris Saint-Germain supporters inside the stadium here,
[10097.10 - 10102.10] P:1726.51 E:0.103157 |  is two-round rather dived into that challenge with Fabien Rouiz,
[10102.10 - 10105.10] P:1731.52 E:0.093918 |  who's been on the end of a number of rough challenges.
[10105.10 - 10108.10] P:1651.30 E:0.097632 |  He was 50-50-ish, but he went in and caught Fabien Rouiz,
[10108.10 - 10112.10] P:1545.53 E:0.082409 |  and it's a yellow card, yellow card for two-round.
[10112.10 - 10115.10] P:1482.50 E:0.095908 |  You're absolutely right, Chris, in the Champions League this season.
[10115.10 - 10119.10] P:1468.11 E:0.087663 |  When we went to Park de Prans in January,
[10119.10 - 10121.10] P:1351.01 E:0.090583 |  when they were going to play Manchester City,
[10121.10 - 10123.10] P:1459.00 E:0.086085 |  they were tottering then.
[10123.10 - 10126.10] P:1480.31 E:0.101721 |  They were actually in the elimination places in the league phase,
[10126.10 - 10128.10] P:1169.96 E:0.097782 |  this new league phase this season.
[10128.10 - 10130.10] P:1562.33 E:0.092364 |  That's where PSG were.
[10130.10 - 10132.10] P:1681.34 E:0.110107 |  As here they play the ball forward,
[10132.10 - 10134.10] P:1741.84 E:0.095758 |  and then they're offside, takes it on into the box.
[10134.10 - 10137.10] P:1585.61 E:0.096949 |  Barclay's ball across, and the arriving,
[10137.10 - 10139.10] P:1481.33 E:0.100338 |  then Ballet wasn't able to get a touch on that.
[10139.10 - 10141.10] P:1446.34 E:0.094699 |  There is no flag onside.
[10141.10 - 10143.10] P:1774.48 E:0.102131 |  Fabien Rouiz with a cross, comes out the head of the defender,
[10143.10 - 10146.10] P:1577.66 E:0.096501 |  then Barcalay couldn't keep the shot down,
[10146.10 - 10151.10] P:1647.92 E:0.096276 |  and blazes it over the top of the bar from 8-10 yards.
[10151.10 - 10154.10] P:1795.83 E:0.110574 |  He's got a score, Barcalay. Good ball from Rouiz to the far post.
[10154.10 - 10157.10] P:1773.73 E:0.090386 |  Takibi trying to attack it, takes a touch,
[10157.10 - 10160.10] P:1601.24 E:0.092642 |  six yards out on the point of the six-yard line,
[10160.10 - 10162.10] P:1507.17 E:0.106979 |  and Amazard a yard over the bar.
[10162.10 - 10164.10] P:1585.95 E:0.090303 |  Just has to control that effort.
[10164.10 - 10167.10] P:1709.39 E:0.095479 |  Easier if he just tries to choke that into the floor.
[10167.10 - 10171.10] P:1430.55 E:0.087267 |  He goes for a break, should have been four.
[10171.10 - 10175.10] P:1556.71 E:0.098307 |  Another change, and that is, is that number five it is?
[10175.10 - 10179.10] P:1352.14 E:0.104013 |  Number five for Inter, and that's the end of Cello Nollu.
[10179.10 - 10184.10] P:1468.15 E:0.101519 |  He's had quite a difficult night, hasn't he, in the midfield for Inter?
[10184.10 - 10186.10] P:1533.01 E:0.105079 |  He did get a knock early on, if you remember,
[10186.10 - 10188.10] P:1700.69 E:0.098003 |  in the first few minutes of the match,
[10188.10 - 10193.10] P:1638.49 E:0.084681 |  but it's this brilliant PSG midfield that has run the show.
[10193.10 - 10195.10] P:1568.58 E:0.082995 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[10195.10 - 10198.10] P:1583.75 E:0.093225 |  I think all the Inter midfielders have struggled,
[10198.10 - 10201.10] P:1631.22 E:0.097135 |  I think the Mkhitaryan, Cello Nollu have had many touches,
[10201.10 - 10203.10] P:1666.32 E:0.113531 |  Borel has been involved a little bit more.
[10203.10 - 10207.10] P:1729.33 E:0.096897 |  Yeah, there's PSG, Fabian Rouiz stabs it forward.
[10207.10 - 10210.10] P:1637.67 E:0.106629 |  Here's the tile of Chaneves, who I think was fouled.
[10210.10 - 10213.10] P:1577.45 E:0.095405 |  Coravats-Calea passes it forward, Fabian Rouiz on the chase,
[10213.10 - 10217.10] P:1674.37 E:0.087653 |  and the referee actually is going to bring it back for the foul.
[10218.10 - 10220.10] P:1531.47 E:0.100037 |  What's he doing here?
[10220.10 - 10223.10] P:1660.62 E:0.101575 |  He's looking for the player who, it's a Chirby.
[10223.10 - 10229.10] P:1672.51 E:0.096227 |  It's a Chirby who turns with that straggly hair hanging down,
[10229.10 - 10233.10] P:1395.45 E:0.097147 |  and that rough beard of his, he turns and he says,
[10233.10 - 10242.10] P:1435.62 E:0.099365 |  Nihili, for that blatant block on Chaneves.
[10242.10 - 10245.10] P:1377.93 E:0.116837 |  So a Chirby, it's not going to happen tonight
[10245.10 - 10248.10] P:1365.00 E:0.106293 |  after that amazing semi-final,
[10248.10 - 10252.10] P:1393.41 E:0.106165 |  and the goal that he scored is first Champions League goal,
[10252.10 - 10255.10] P:1470.82 E:0.098378 |  and what a finisher as well it was on his right foot.
[10255.10 - 10258.10] P:1462.93 E:0.099350 |  And it looks as though that effort, really,
[10258.10 - 10263.10] P:1640.15 E:0.084237 |  in the Champions League for Inter to get through against Barcelona
[10263.10 - 10266.10] P:1657.68 E:0.097683 |  has been their final fling.
[10266.10 - 10269.10] P:1670.63 E:0.093755 |  They've not been able to live with PSG in the way that they went
[10269.10 - 10272.10] P:1606.27 E:0.086337 |  toe-to-toe with Barcelona.
[10272.10 - 10277.10] P:1520.94 E:0.086425 |  And Patio blocked the taking of that free kick there,
[10277.10 - 10279.10] P:1459.77 E:0.091128 |  but referee allows it to go.
[10279.10 - 10281.10] P:1621.38 E:0.104690 |  Pirella pass out towards the left-hand side.
[10281.10 - 10284.10] P:1646.74 E:0.098240 |  Rather confusingly, someone in the stands here seems to have a referee's whistle
[10284.10 - 10288.10] P:1541.69 E:0.097397 |  that they keep blowing. Fabian Rouiz, halfway inside his own half.
[10288.10 - 10292.10] P:1597.59 E:0.094740 |  If you've just switched on to us on Five Live or the World Service,
[10292.10 - 10296.10] P:1618.51 E:0.104325 |  PSG are on their way to victory here in Munich,
[10296.10 - 10299.10] P:1508.07 E:0.081626 |  three-nil up on Inter,
[10299.10 - 10302.10] P:1425.66 E:0.101839 |  and Luis Enrique is going to be the man
[10302.10 - 10306.10] P:1693.25 E:0.100283 |  it would appear who's finally going to deliver the big trophy
[10306.10 - 10309.10] P:1534.36 E:0.100577 |  for the modern Paris Saint-Germain.
[10309.10 - 10314.10] P:1737.89 E:0.112701 |  Dempare's pass forward, Côte d'Ascaliers under this, into the box!
[10314.10 - 10316.10] P:1447.01 E:0.118873 |  Scores number four!
[10316.10 - 10319.10] P:1591.24 E:0.113300 |  That seals it!
[10319.10 - 10321.10] P:1621.06 E:0.113783 |  Côte d'Ascaliers!
[10321.10 - 10326.10] P:1582.97 E:0.113930 |  With a finish that was unerring past summer.
[10326.10 - 10331.10] P:1499.44 E:0.117740 |  Which four-nil now, all of the players are involved in the celebrations.
[10331.10 - 10334.10] P:1502.10 E:0.113642 |  Luis Enrique is down on the pitch here in front of us.
[10334.10 - 10338.10] P:1561.50 E:0.113944 |  He's dancing, he's punching his fists into the air.
[10338.10 - 10341.10] P:1411.83 E:0.110470 |  Paris Saint-Germain know they've got it now.
[10341.10 - 10345.10] P:1367.88 E:0.111086 |  They're going to be collecting that Champions League trophy.
[10345.10 - 10347.10] P:1286.27 E:0.099292 |  Four-nil!
[10347.10 - 10351.10] P:1393.78 E:0.106165 |  Ah, it's an absolute mauling, isn't it?
[10351.10 - 10353.10] P:1390.55 E:0.105997 |  It really is.
[10353.10 - 10357.10] P:1576.25 E:0.104461 |  Once he went through Gravatt-Scalier, you knew he was going to finish.
[10357.10 - 10362.10] P:1371.52 E:0.107172 |  Winger's once again Dempare on the drift in the wide area.
[10362.10 - 10367.10] P:1592.49 E:0.092794 |  Slips the ball through to Gravatt-Scalier.
[10367.10 - 10371.10] P:1603.14 E:0.112017 |  Bistoni can't get near him, and he just draws summer out.
[10371.10 - 10374.10] P:1581.74 E:0.097024 |  Someone leaves that gap at the near post.
[10374.10 - 10376.10] P:1519.39 E:0.111119 |  And he finds the gap.
[10376.10 - 10379.10] P:1812.40 E:0.098484 |  It's a devastating finish, it's a clinical finish.
[10379.10 - 10383.10] P:1541.06 E:0.096174 |  DSG a bit clinical all evening.
[10383.10 - 10387.10] P:1575.07 E:0.099572 |  Couple of wing wizards tonight with important goals,
[10387.10 - 10389.10] P:1597.99 E:0.075126 |  but what an evening.
[10389.10 - 10394.10] P:1621.50 E:0.090298 |  They have absolutely annihilated Inter.
[10394.10 - 10397.10] P:1645.63 E:0.108623 |  Wild, wild celebrations from Paris Saint-Germain.
[10397.10 - 10400.10] P:1461.37 E:0.100502 |  Their supporters in the stands, all of the players,
[10400.10 - 10403.10] P:1658.70 E:0.097696 |  the substitutes, whether they've gone off the field,
[10403.10 - 10407.10] P:1632.24 E:0.102722 |  whether they're yet to come on, the coaching staff, Luis Enrique.
[10407.10 - 10411.10] P:1511.00 E:0.102471 |  They know that was the moment, that was the release there that we saw.
[10411.10 - 10416.10] P:1460.07 E:0.096814 |  With that finish from this great Georgian, Kavicic,
[10416.10 - 10421.10] P:1418.21 E:0.102875 |  Kavaratt-Scalier, was sent away, and he only had one thing on his mind.
[10421.10 - 10425.10] P:1472.14 E:0.101231 |  That ball, after the chances that he'd missed in this match,
[10425.10 - 10428.10] P:1457.99 E:0.104461 |  that ball was going to end up in the back of the net,
[10428.10 - 10430.10] P:1829.48 E:0.100173 |  and it surely did.
[10430.10 - 10433.10] P:1495.51 E:0.093000 |  He smashed it past the Inter goalkeeper.
[10433.10 - 10437.10] P:1637.14 E:0.092306 |  Four-nil, and this Georgian,
[10437.10 - 10441.10] P:1489.01 E:0.088972 |  this Georgian who is an absolute delight to watch.
[10441.10 - 10444.10] P:1429.16 E:0.102547 |  With his slight figure, and his blue socks down,
[10444.10 - 10447.10] P:1444.91 E:0.101503 |  and his white cape around his left wrist.
[10447.10 - 10450.10] P:1507.62 E:0.111943 |  The man who keeps the ball under his spell,
[10450.10 - 10453.10] P:1286.61 E:0.107728 |  well, he's waved the wand,
[10453.10 - 10458.10] P:1447.00 E:0.111212 |  and the PSG celebrations now are absolutely in full swing,
[10458.10 - 10461.10] P:1276.86 E:0.099099 |  here in the home of Bayern Munich.
[10461.10 - 10464.10] P:1326.91 E:0.102448 |  Yeah, the other thing,
[10464.10 - 10466.10] P:1350.01 E:0.107455 |  that Scalier is his work, right, isn't it?
[10466.10 - 10469.10] P:1527.65 E:0.098010 |  His work ethic chasing back, it's not a prima donna,
[10469.10 - 10471.10] P:1574.13 E:0.083471 |  doesn't think he's cracked it.
[10471.10 - 10475.10] P:1701.34 E:0.081799 |  Barella might have a goal, in fact, beats Pacho, still going,
[10475.10 - 10478.10] P:1788.38 E:0.097788 |  lizard off to his left, and then the shot from Choran
[10478.10 - 10481.10] P:1652.84 E:0.101573 |  is blocked on the edge of the six-yard box,
[10481.10 - 10484.10] P:1609.98 E:0.088539 |  and PSG are able to get it away.
[10484.10 - 10487.10] P:1629.67 E:0.101102 |  That was, well, a chance to not your goal, but I'm afraid it's gone.
[10487.10 - 10489.10] P:1733.19 E:0.096441 |  This final's gone for Inter.
[10489.10 - 10492.10] P:1692.27 E:0.100612 |  No real conviction in the finish run, to Ram.
[10492.10 - 10495.10] P:1593.14 E:0.096561 |  Barella did well, maybe should have been awarded a free kick.
[10495.10 - 10498.10] P:1598.69 E:0.098735 |  The referee played a good advantage, but that's Donnarumma.
[10498.10 - 10501.10] P:1578.50 E:0.100980 |  Down to a T, isn't it? Down to his left-hand side.
[10501.10 - 10504.10] P:1396.46 E:0.094461 |  It's Ram trying to find that far corner.
[10504.10 - 10507.10] P:1339.05 E:0.096743 |  Donnarumma reading the shot.
[10507.10 - 10511.10] P:1395.67 E:0.105690 |  And, unsurprisingly, keeping it out, big left hand.
[10511.10 - 10514.10] P:1378.43 E:0.104666 |  Well, that's what he'll want, go on T, Donnarumma.
[10514.10 - 10516.10] P:1429.62 E:0.108124 |  Another clean sheet.
[10516.10 - 10520.10] P:1371.59 E:0.104198 |  More clean sheets for Jan Sommer tonight, the very opposite.
[10520.10 - 10524.10] P:1388.17 E:0.098470 |  Inter mentioned their defensive capabilities,
[10524.10 - 10528.10] P:1398.81 E:0.095698 |  but, well, tonight, PSG have just been too good for them.
[10528.10 - 10533.10] P:1409.77 E:0.095233 |  Four goals on the night, and the ball from Inter
[10533.10 - 10535.10] P:1593.53 E:0.099844 |  right across the area.
[10535.10 - 10538.10] P:1501.72 E:0.100745 |  I think it took a touch off one of the PSG players in the box,
[10538.10 - 10541.10] P:1478.86 E:0.101554 |  which means that it's gone behind for a corner.
[10541.10 - 10547.10] P:1355.91 E:0.108167 |  Luis Enrique is just preparing to make another change
[10547.10 - 10552.10] P:1339.85 E:0.099093 |  with Lucas Hernandez coming on, the French international.
[10552.10 - 10555.10] P:1471.43 E:0.105921 |  Corner for Inter, into the near post.
[10555.10 - 10558.10] P:1321.08 E:0.095512 |  That's headed away, bounces across the box,
[10558.10 - 10561.10] P:1442.92 E:0.108833 |  and then is hoisted high by Marquinhos.
[10561.10 - 10564.10] P:1460.56 E:0.096720 |  Donnarumma comes, gets a punch on that,
[10564.10 - 10566.10] P:1420.67 E:0.101289 |  but it's already bounced behind the line,
[10566.10 - 10568.10] P:1438.49 E:0.100809 |  and it's another Inter corner.
[10569.10 - 10575.10] P:1285.29 E:0.099900 |  Lucas Hernandez just waiting to get his chance
[10575.10 - 10578.10] P:1541.27 E:0.104660 |  to become a part of all this.
[10580.10 - 10583.10] P:1621.42 E:0.101458 |  Corner from the left-hand side this time.
[10583.10 - 10585.10] P:1768.94 E:0.109346 |  It's a deep one into the gloves of Donnarumma,
[10585.10 - 10587.10] P:1748.85 E:0.096844 |  who's able to back away, catch the ball,
[10587.10 - 10589.10] P:1719.30 E:0.088170 |  and then thunder down to the ground
[10589.10 - 10591.10] P:1714.87 E:0.092973 |  and hold that ball securely.
[10591.10 - 10596.10] P:1642.03 E:0.084255 |  So we've got 13 minutes to play.
[10596.10 - 10601.10] P:1609.36 E:0.091300 |  Chris, 13 minutes before we can properly herald
[10601.10 - 10603.10] P:1570.06 E:0.101209 |  Paris Saint-Germain as Champions League winners
[10603.10 - 10605.10] P:1549.57 E:0.076131 |  for the first time.
[10605.10 - 10609.10] P:1427.76 E:0.096218 |  I think what they would want to do now is nothing silly,
[10609.10 - 10611.10] P:1733.94 E:0.100923 |  not to give anything away.
[10611.10 - 10613.10] P:1790.70 E:0.089452 |  Just not be careless, really.
[10613.10 - 10618.10] P:1596.74 E:0.073790 |  Keep that intensity level up for the games done and dusted
[10618.10 - 10620.10] P:1709.12 E:0.081889 |  from a player's perspective.
[10620.10 - 10624.10] P:1718.53 E:0.087058 |  It's just making sure you see it through now,
[10624.10 - 10627.10] P:1810.13 E:0.079462 |  and they will do, I'm sure, are that.
[10627.10 - 10629.10] P:1822.85 E:0.093092 |  Two goals in each half.
[10629.10 - 10632.10] P:1734.40 E:0.094959 |  Hakimi and Douay in the first 20 minutes.
[10632.10 - 10634.10] P:1623.98 E:0.101003 |  That set the tone, but really more than that,
[10634.10 - 10636.10] P:1787.95 E:0.083036 |  it was the way that Paris Saint-Germain
[10636.10 - 10638.10] P:1693.06 E:0.101327 |  imposed themselves on this final,
[10638.10 - 10640.10] P:1610.21 E:0.079691 |  but set the tone then.
[10640.10 - 10645.10] P:1549.69 E:0.090540 |  And this second change that PSG are making
[10645.10 - 10649.10] P:1755.63 E:0.093095 |  will see Nuno Mendes leaving the field.
[10649.10 - 10652.10] P:1742.31 E:0.103452 |  He's been one of their players of the season,
[10652.10 - 10655.10] P:1802.61 E:0.099037 |  but there again, you could probably say that
[10655.10 - 10659.10] P:1902.16 E:0.081062 |  about almost every man out there.
[10659.10 - 10662.10] P:1724.52 E:0.094190 |  Brilliant in those 1v1 situations.
[10662.10 - 10664.10] P:1552.95 E:0.089058 |  Nuno Mendes. Not a bad replacement.
[10664.10 - 10666.10] P:1433.47 E:0.075865 |  Not bad.
[10666.10 - 10669.10] P:1673.26 E:0.087747 |  Nuno Mendes, World Cup winner,
[10669.10 - 10673.10] P:1586.80 E:0.090597 |  coming on to replace the Portuguese left back,
[10673.10 - 10675.10] P:1421.30 E:0.098926 |  who, as I say, will be playing here again,
[10675.10 - 10678.10] P:1409.43 E:0.084891 |  at Howard mansion on Wednesday night
[10678.10 - 10681.10] P:1396.14 E:0.093710 |  for Roberto Martinez's Portugal in the Nations League.
[10682.10 - 10685.10] P:1461.11 E:0.098426 |  Against Germany in the semi-final in that competition.
[10685.10 - 10688.10] P:1525.17 E:0.092767 |  As Barcailat carries it forward.
[10688.10 - 10691.10] P:1700.88 E:0.088524 |  This time next week, by the way, if you're listening to Five Live,
[10691.10 - 10695.10] P:1547.65 E:0.083600 |  you'll be hearing us in Barcelona for Andorra against England.
[10695.10 - 10699.10] P:1674.05 E:0.083599 |  The next match for Thomas Tupol and Cole as Inter bring it forward.
[10699.10 - 10702.10] P:1618.19 E:0.105694 |  We'll bring you commentary on all of the World Cup qualifiers
[10702.10 - 10704.10] P:1801.90 E:0.118125 |  and internationals.
[10704.10 - 10707.10] P:1695.49 E:0.109088 |  Caravats-Kalia is tackling back on Dumfries.
[10707.10 - 10710.10] P:1778.83 E:0.107672 |  They love that, and then Dumfries fouls Caravats-Kalia.
[10711.10 - 10713.10] P:1786.97 E:0.094730 |  And it's a free kick.
[10713.10 - 10715.10] P:1739.91 E:0.097754 |  And they come across,
[10715.10 - 10717.10] P:1806.15 E:0.096269 |  Fettiniar comes across and gives him a cuddle.
[10717.10 - 10722.10] P:1880.86 E:0.095959 |  But that sums up this PSG team under Lewis Enrique.
[10722.10 - 10725.10] P:1763.91 E:0.094508 |  It didn't happen with Mbappe and the team.
[10725.10 - 10728.10] P:1679.87 E:0.101163 |  Forward's tracking back.
[10728.10 - 10731.10] P:1551.92 E:0.106177 |  And it's been a constant all night, hasn't it?
[10731.10 - 10733.10] P:1486.77 E:0.090349 |  Good with the ball.
[10733.10 - 10735.10] P:1429.12 E:0.115410 |  Outstanding without the ball.
[10735.10 - 10737.10] P:1578.15 E:0.099672 |  Lewis Enrique a couple of moments ago,
[10737.10 - 10740.10] P:1739.95 E:0.103505 |  applauding Dembele for shutting down Janssommel.
[10740.10 - 10742.10] P:1518.23 E:0.099738 |  Janssommel punting the ball up the pitch.
[10742.10 - 10747.10] P:1774.84 E:0.086598 |  PSG flying in to offside.
[10747.10 - 10749.10] P:1792.40 E:0.103896 |  It's all about the work rate, isn't it?
[10749.10 - 10751.10] P:1713.58 E:0.095047 |  That work ethic, the team spirit.
[10751.10 - 10757.10] P:1619.03 E:0.101922 |  Yeah, as Fabian Ruiz plays it to Caravats-Kalia,
[10757.10 - 10761.10] P:1672.05 E:0.093687 |  who skips infield, but Borral is able to get a touch on this,
[10761.10 - 10765.10] P:1574.64 E:0.103825 |  and it's deflected back into the Inter penalty area.
[10765.10 - 10772.10] P:1361.48 E:0.103511 |  So 4-0, and the worry for Inter is that it seems to me
[10772.10 - 10776.10] P:1403.71 E:0.102496 |  that PSG are in the mood to actually get one or two more.
[10776.10 - 10779.10] P:1550.10 E:0.086718 |  And with gaps showing at the back and the changes
[10779.10 - 10784.10] P:1691.34 E:0.083454 |  that they've had to make, Inter, that might be entirely possible.
[10784.10 - 10786.10] P:1837.36 E:0.104495 |  I think it's one of those who's Inter,
[10786.10 - 10788.10] P:1913.49 E:0.100372 |  they've got enough experience in the team.
[10788.10 - 10792.10] P:1682.59 E:0.081306 |  They're not getting back in this, just shut up shop.
[10792.10 - 10797.10] P:1791.13 E:0.093116 |  As Inter come forward, and actually try a shot from the edge of the area
[10797.10 - 10801.10] P:1701.53 E:0.100989 |  that is hit by Zalevsky, but straight at Donnarumma,
[10801.10 - 10804.10] P:1602.08 E:0.108585 |  who's able to make a routine save.
[10804.10 - 10811.10] P:1351.29 E:0.108064 |  10 minutes to go, Paris Saint-Germain, 4-0 up as Marquinhos,
[10811.10 - 10813.10] P:1229.02 E:0.099297 |  puts his foot on the ball.
[10813.10 - 10817.10] P:1526.89 E:0.090384 |  Lucas Hernandez is able to get his first feel
[10817.10 - 10820.10] P:1711.28 E:0.093257 |  of that Champions League final ball,
[10820.10 - 10823.10] P:1616.79 E:0.101667 |  and then passes it to D'Altiniar, who wasn't able this time
[10823.10 - 10826.10] P:1559.80 E:0.087709 |  to slip the pass through against Dembele.
[10826.10 - 10829.10] P:1770.17 E:0.106517 |  He's cut out by a derby, but watch out,
[10829.10 - 10832.10] P:1735.35 E:0.098291 |  watch out into Barcalas now onto it.
[10832.10 - 10834.10] P:1695.57 E:0.119219 |  Barcalas, he's passed the derby!
[10834.10 - 10836.10] P:1605.32 E:0.113732 |  Oh, he's put it wide!
[10836.10 - 10838.10] P:1554.30 E:0.110149 |  Oh, he did everything there.
[10838.10 - 10842.10] P:1765.50 E:0.087892 |  He left a derby on the seat of his pants
[10842.10 - 10846.10] P:1714.30 E:0.091468 |  and just had to pop it past Summer into the bottom corner
[10846.10 - 10849.10] P:1613.31 E:0.085651 |  and put it wide into the side netting.
[10849.10 - 10851.10] P:1523.80 E:0.088458 |  I believe he's missed that.
[10851.10 - 10854.10] P:1660.66 E:0.101060 |  It was so good how he set a derby up,
[10854.10 - 10859.10] P:1627.34 E:0.086582 |  shaped on his right foot to fire a shot into the far corner,
[10859.10 - 10865.10] P:1815.77 E:0.083049 |  sat him down, and then one-on-one has to score,
[10865.10 - 10868.10] P:1881.73 E:0.097990 |  tries to beat Summer in his near post from six yards
[10868.10 - 10870.10] P:1696.68 E:0.090743 |  and drags it horribly.
[10870.10 - 10874.10] P:1692.29 E:0.098949 |  What a piece of skill, though, and then the poor execution.
[10874.10 - 10876.10] P:1719.79 E:0.081059 |  Well, where's that come from?
[10876.10 - 10879.10] P:1719.00 E:0.097423 |  That's the Bradley Barcalas I remember last season.
[10879.10 - 10882.10] P:1533.90 E:0.088387 |  Do you remember the Magic against Newcastle?
[10882.10 - 10885.10] P:1541.61 E:0.098740 |  Well, he's some of the chances he missed in that match,
[10885.10 - 10892.10] P:1396.18 E:0.101666 |  but this one, I mean, he created with absolute genius, really.
[10892.10 - 10899.10] P:1522.84 E:0.094998 |  And he made a derby look 57, never mind 37.
[10899.10 - 10901.10] P:1622.14 E:0.086663 |  Here's Lucas Hernandez.
[10901.10 - 10904.10] P:1573.08 E:0.091345 |  If they get another one, by the way, the biggest score,
[10904.10 - 10909.10] P:1742.95 E:0.080440 |  the biggest score line in terms of winning margin is four goals.
[10909.10 - 10915.10] P:1704.79 E:0.087286 |  That's the biggest winning margin in any European club final.
[10915.10 - 10922.10] P:1544.99 E:0.094793 |  So another one would set a record as Barcalas is able to carry it forward.
[10922.10 - 10925.10] P:1596.58 E:0.099817 |  So that's any of the European competitions.
[10925.10 - 10928.10] P:1428.06 E:0.101664 |  My mind goes back to Middlesbrough when they lost to Seville.
[10928.10 - 10930.10] P:1230.65 E:0.099034 |  That was 4-0.
[10930.10 - 10933.10] P:1612.54 E:0.093035 |  And of course, one of the most famous finals of all,
[10933.10 - 10936.10] P:1588.70 E:0.083165 |  Real Madrid, Eintracht, Frankfurt.
[10936.10 - 10938.10] P:1452.68 E:0.094027 |  That was 7-3, wasn't it?
[10938.10 - 10940.10] P:1528.94 E:0.105063 |  So that was the full goal margin.
[10940.10 - 10943.10] P:1592.03 E:0.108954 |  And now we get the Olés.
[10943.10 - 10946.10] P:1513.52 E:0.105957 |  They might be French, but they're giving it the Olés.
[10946.10 - 10948.10] P:1574.85 E:0.101138 |  And why not?
[10948.10 - 10951.10] P:1312.55 E:0.095025 |  And just looking to my left now,
[10951.10 - 10954.10] P:1444.44 E:0.111548 |  there are three tiers there of PSG supporters.
[10954.10 - 10956.10] P:1513.15 E:0.112007 |  And again, just to underline it,
[10956.10 - 10958.10] P:1389.18 E:0.100922 |  you maybe weren't listening earlier,
[10958.10 - 10962.10] P:1634.78 E:0.111519 |  as the ball is played forward by Fabian Ruiz de Barcalas,
[10962.10 - 10965.10] P:1748.90 E:0.092495 |  who pulls his shot wide across the face of goal.
[10965.10 - 10967.10] P:1701.93 E:0.094218 |  Dembele was waiting in the middle.
[10967.10 - 10969.10] P:1935.88 E:0.084729 |  He's not got in on the app yet.
[10969.10 - 10974.10] P:1869.23 E:0.098770 |  Hakimi, two for Douay, and one for Kivaratskjelja.
[10974.10 - 10980.10] P:1760.43 E:0.092971 |  And Luis Enrique says, OK, let's throw another three on.
[10980.10 - 10983.10] P:1611.12 E:0.097475 |  So Warren Zaire Emery, another of the teenagers,
[10983.10 - 10986.10] P:1679.46 E:0.103203 |  is going to come on into the midfield to replace Fabian Ruiz.
[10986.10 - 10989.10] P:1647.05 E:0.107596 |  So I say, he's taken a few knocks tonight.
[10989.10 - 10995.10] P:1842.28 E:0.098092 |  So the very highly-raped Zaire Emery is going to come on.
[10995.10 - 10999.10] P:1713.63 E:0.105079 |  Gonzalo Ramos, this is a move that we're very used to seeing.
[10999.10 - 11008.10] P:1695.35 E:0.092610 |  Gonzalo Ramos coming on to replace Kivaratskjelja.
[11008.10 - 11011.10] P:1726.74 E:0.092047 |  So that's the end of his evening.
[11011.10 - 11014.10] P:1730.55 E:0.102752 |  So the Georgian has left the field.
[11014.10 - 11017.10] P:1681.48 E:0.083179 |  Sorry to see him go as well, Chris.
[11017.10 - 11024.10] P:1589.22 E:0.089058 |  Yep. Absolutely. Not an evening, he said.
[11024.10 - 11025.10] P:1733.84 E:0.113973 |  Was it Neves?
[11025.10 - 11030.10] P:1712.22 E:0.097175 |  He's one, I think it is Neves.
[11030.10 - 11032.10] P:1753.14 E:0.083704 |  Yes, it was. Shrao Neves.
[11032.10 - 11035.10] P:1495.30 E:0.086024 |  So those are the three changes.
[11035.10 - 11039.10] P:1510.64 E:0.098063 |  And we have also coming on to the field.
[11039.10 - 11043.10] P:1623.82 E:0.111866 |  And Seny Mayulu, another of the teenagers.
[11043.10 - 11047.10] P:1669.60 E:0.097355 |  So that's two 19-year-olds coming on.
[11047.10 - 11052.10] P:1445.40 E:0.106693 |  And Soma clearing the ball from his own penalty area
[11052.10 - 11056.10] P:1284.11 E:0.092571 |  to the halfway line as Inter again.
[11056.10 - 11058.10] P:1197.48 E:0.104159 |  Mount some kind of attack.
[11058.10 - 11062.10] P:1398.49 E:0.091363 |  They're managing to maintain some energy in this,
[11062.10 - 11068.10] P:1406.75 E:0.090012 |  even though at 4-0 down, that is a mightily tough thing to do.
[11068.10 - 11071.10] P:1469.75 E:0.107771 |  Damian, and it's going to be so hard for Insargi
[11071.10 - 11074.10] P:1485.14 E:0.091991 |  and the players to have to explain this away.
[11074.10 - 11079.10] P:1457.92 E:0.090178 |  This simple explanation is PSG has just been far too good.
[11079.10 - 11083.10] P:1723.53 E:0.108425 |  I think it's one of those after you try and analyse the game
[11083.10 - 11085.10] P:1507.60 E:0.090149 |  and you could strip everything back.
[11085.10 - 11088.10] P:1397.71 E:0.103373 |  But at that point you may jump PSG,
[11088.10 - 11091.10] P:1316.12 E:0.097591 |  just put in a different league.
[11091.10 - 11096.10] P:1469.75 E:0.084763 |  They have...
[11096.10 - 11100.10] P:1524.58 E:0.095070 |  Damian passing it through the middle, where...
[11102.10 - 11105.10] P:1688.66 E:0.109573 |  Martin has tried to turn on the edge of the box,
[11105.10 - 11107.10] P:1657.75 E:0.091140 |  but just too physical.
[11107.10 - 11109.10] P:1553.79 E:0.106910 |  He's not been able to get into the game.
[11109.10 - 11112.10] P:1518.45 E:0.099409 |  Martin has had a recent injury,
[11112.10 - 11115.10] P:1489.33 E:0.084756 |  but I don't know whether that's anything to do with it.
[11115.10 - 11117.10] P:1518.53 E:0.107908 |  Just not seen enough of the ball.
[11117.10 - 11118.10] P:1759.08 E:0.087260 |  No, exactly that.
[11118.10 - 11120.10] P:1842.63 E:0.099193 |  Like a service in fairness, PSG,
[11120.10 - 11124.10] P:1333.02 E:0.096951 |  Pachir and Marquinhos have both of two into strike
[11124.10 - 11126.10] P:1414.25 E:0.107479 |  as pretty well this evening.
[11128.10 - 11130.10] P:1546.11 E:0.113466 |  That's Chris Sutton with us on Five Live
[11130.10 - 11135.10] P:1515.45 E:0.085915 |  on this joyous night for Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
[11135.10 - 11139.10] P:1598.51 E:0.095877 |  There's PSG, break forward again,
[11139.10 - 11141.10] P:1624.69 E:0.098309 |  and the gaps once again open up.
[11141.10 - 11143.10] P:1622.24 E:0.084566 |  Barcala receives it on the edge of the box,
[11143.10 - 11146.10] P:1578.73 E:0.094848 |  back to the edge of the area, into Barcala.
[11146.10 - 11150.10] P:1719.90 E:0.104459 |  Left side of the box, now forward again, and that's it!
[11150.10 - 11152.10] P:1664.48 E:0.113217 |  It's 5-0!
[11152.10 - 11155.10] P:1519.80 E:0.110608 |  It's a record scoreline!
[11155.10 - 11159.10] P:1538.59 E:0.116637 |  Seneb Aulou, the 19-year-old,
[11161.10 - 11165.10] P:1484.78 E:0.124595 |  has sparked extraordinary celebrations
[11165.10 - 11167.10] P:1453.30 E:0.105843 |  on the pitch here in Munich.
[11167.10 - 11171.10] P:1477.92 E:0.108719 |  5-0 on the night, the biggest score
[11171.10 - 11175.10] P:1438.07 E:0.117559 |  that has ever been witnessed in a European club final.
[11175.10 - 11178.10] P:1439.90 E:0.106914 |  The biggest margin of victory.
[11178.10 - 11183.10] P:1404.18 E:0.115706 |  And Luis Enrique, all of the years that Paris Saint-Germain
[11183.10 - 11186.10] P:1457.55 E:0.106794 |  have waited for this day to arrive,
[11186.10 - 11189.10] P:1541.26 E:0.107541 |  it is all absolutely pouring out here,
[11189.10 - 11192.10] P:1575.46 E:0.105518 |  with that finish for number five
[11192.10 - 11197.10] P:1518.68 E:0.110273 |  from another of the Academy product, Seneb Aulou.
[11197.10 - 11203.10] P:1568.55 E:0.102404 |  Paris Saint-Germain 5-0, what a scoreline!
[11203.10 - 11207.10] P:1528.94 E:0.109352 |  What a moment with Aulou.
[11207.10 - 11211.10] P:1438.65 E:0.080376 |  Clever little ball into Barcala,
[11211.10 - 11214.10] P:1634.96 E:0.112203 |  and he just carries his run on, little underlap
[11214.10 - 11216.10] P:1331.02 E:0.086426 |  on the wrong side of Damien.
[11216.10 - 11219.10] P:1449.74 E:0.083524 |  Angle against him, left footed, goes for power,
[11219.10 - 11224.10] P:1586.69 E:0.089271 |  beats Summer, had his near post, in off the near post.
[11224.10 - 11229.10] P:1450.23 E:0.085079 |  What a great moment for the young man, off the bench.
[11229.10 - 11231.10] P:1513.36 E:0.083771 |  Gets his goal.
[11231.10 - 11236.10] P:1441.32 E:0.085485 |  I mean, this is an absolute pummelling, isn't it?
[11236.10 - 11240.10] P:1483.06 E:0.097192 |  Well, he did score in the Champions League earlier this season
[11240.10 - 11245.10] P:1582.37 E:0.091658 |  in the playoff round, when they hammered seven goals past Brest.
[11245.10 - 11250.10] P:1635.38 E:0.095762 |  And that is their record win in European competitions.
[11250.10 - 11254.10] P:1668.79 E:0.093763 |  But for all of the predictions, and all of the talking
[11254.10 - 11257.10] P:1813.00 E:0.094457 |  before this match, here over the last couple of days
[11257.10 - 11261.10] P:1806.90 E:0.084157 |  and in the build-up to it, 50-50.
[11261.10 - 11265.10] P:1687.62 E:0.096599 |  Could goal, could goal, Inter, could goal PSG.
[11265.10 - 11268.10] P:1480.56 E:0.101840 |  Are you having a pop at me there, John?
[11268.10 - 11270.10] P:1611.11 E:0.092713 |  I was saying exactly the same thing.
[11270.10 - 11272.10] P:1665.55 E:0.103581 |  No one's saying, no one is saying,
[11272.10 - 11275.10] P:1700.43 E:0.089330 |  Paris Saint-Germain are going to hammer them 5-0.
[11275.10 - 11278.10] P:1561.83 E:0.088672 |  Maybe lack of experience.
[11278.10 - 11281.10] P:1532.73 E:0.073551 |  How would they cope?
[11281.10 - 11283.10] P:1754.03 E:0.082988 |  All of that.
[11283.10 - 11286.10] P:1698.51 E:0.095469 |  I'll tell you what, Lewis and Reakey can move, can't they?
[11286.10 - 11289.10] P:1687.70 E:0.099865 |  You talk about the running the PSG plays have done on the pitch,
[11289.10 - 11293.10] P:1568.96 E:0.091718 |  blind me. See him tearing down the touchline, celebrating.
[11293.10 - 11298.10] P:1440.32 E:0.093893 |  What, the guy who does the Iron Men and the Marathons?
[11298.10 - 11300.10] P:1648.18 E:0.112193 |  That's endurance, John.
[11300.10 - 11302.10] P:1357.50 E:0.074534 |  That's endurance.
[11302.10 - 11304.10] P:1300.38 E:0.086763 |  Shouldn't be dynamism.
[11304.10 - 11306.10] P:1319.69 E:0.102740 |  I think the amount of ground he's covered,
[11306.10 - 11312.10] P:1311.42 E:0.087103 |  he's probably lapped this stadium 15 times.
[11312.10 - 11315.10] P:1468.36 E:0.096325 |  I mean, the PSG supporters in the stands,
[11315.10 - 11319.10] P:1405.50 E:0.095093 |  they must not be able to believe their eyes here tonight.
[11319.10 - 11321.10] P:1387.23 E:0.097237 |  They've got their scarves up,
[11321.10 - 11325.10] P:1462.89 E:0.091794 |  they've got their scarves up above their heads,
[11325.10 - 11329.10] P:1346.52 E:0.104605 |  down in the bottom tier, in fact all three tiers now.
[11329.10 - 11333.10] P:1483.97 E:0.109194 |  And when I say tiers, that stand will be full of tiers once it,
[11333.10 - 11335.10] P:1348.78 E:0.098860 |  tiers of joy.
[11335.10 - 11337.10] P:1585.72 E:0.100916 |  And again, to underline it,
[11337.10 - 11342.10] P:1428.51 E:0.089346 |  this club, Paris Saint-Germain, was only formed in 1970.
[11342.10 - 11345.10] P:1422.03 E:0.094043 |  So it's a relatively young football club
[11345.10 - 11351.10] P:1495.03 E:0.088304 |  when the old Paris FC was merged with Stade Saint-Germain.
[11351.10 - 11353.10] P:1604.65 E:0.093349 |  But then, of course, the big change came
[11353.10 - 11356.10] P:1550.28 E:0.102415 |  when the Qatari ownership got involved.
[11356.10 - 11358.10] P:1679.92 E:0.087734 |  They want six now.
[11358.10 - 11360.10] P:1570.92 E:0.091037 |  Barcala plays it across.
[11360.10 - 11363.10] P:1725.92 E:0.092997 |  Dempale is still not being able to get on the score sheet here tonight,
[11363.10 - 11366.10] P:1621.22 E:0.093133 |  despite the five PSG goals.
[11366.10 - 11369.10] P:1529.67 E:0.091277 |  Vittigna, it's almost like they're trying to set him up for this.
[11369.10 - 11373.10] P:1373.52 E:0.101911 |  Vittigna, then Zaire Emery over to the far side.
[11373.10 - 11375.10] P:1502.70 E:0.104950 |  Inter, absolutely chasing, shadowed.
[11375.10 - 11377.10] P:1664.31 E:0.096464 |  How good has he been, Vittigna,
[11377.10 - 11381.10] P:1658.87 E:0.091032 |  precisely just given the ball for the first time this evening.
[11381.10 - 11385.10] P:1703.55 E:0.068174 |  But, you know, he talked about Douay and...
[11385.10 - 11387.10] P:1514.51 E:0.081476 |  What a scali-up.
[11387.10 - 11391.10] P:1590.38 E:0.095863 |  Yellow card for Hakimi there for breaking down the Inter,
[11391.10 - 11392.10] P:1394.37 E:0.070564 |  Kemper attack.
[11392.10 - 11396.10] P:1586.68 E:0.096860 |  Vittigna's the one who knits everything together, isn't he?
[11396.10 - 11399.10] P:1588.57 E:0.118536 |  And that is it!
[11399.10 - 11403.10] P:1624.85 E:0.112263 |  The referee says 90 minutes are enough.
[11405.10 - 11407.10] P:1589.27 E:0.121475 |  He's basically said to Inter,
[11407.10 - 11410.10] P:1465.32 E:0.101949 |  you've taken enough punishment.
[11410.10 - 11415.10] P:1537.91 E:0.113664 |  Paris Saint-Germain have won the Champions League here in Munich.
[11415.10 - 11419.10] P:1708.86 E:0.094165 |  All of those years of waiting.
[11419.10 - 11421.10] P:1790.54 E:0.115383 |  I think some PSG supporters wonder
[11421.10 - 11424.10] P:1665.53 E:0.100593 |  whether this day would ever come.
[11424.10 - 11428.10] P:1688.03 E:0.096541 |  Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment.
[11428.10 - 11431.10] P:1704.71 E:0.100347 |  Defeat in the final, in the Covid final,
[11431.10 - 11433.10] P:1619.97 E:0.098864 |  where none of the Paris Saint-Germain supporters
[11433.10 - 11435.10] P:1673.13 E:0.095289 |  could be there to witness it.
[11435.10 - 11439.10] P:1700.78 E:0.095257 |  But they are here tonight in their thousands,
[11439.10 - 11444.10] P:1679.17 E:0.101721 |  and they must not be able to believe what they have seen.
[11444.10 - 11446.10] P:1621.14 E:0.094542 |  Five-nil.
[11446.10 - 11448.10] P:1656.23 E:0.106887 |  Luis Enrique is the man.
[11448.10 - 11450.10] P:1727.68 E:0.107228 |  He's brought the trophy.
[11450.10 - 11452.10] P:1607.79 E:0.096548 |  He's brought the big night.
[11452.10 - 11457.10] P:1646.16 E:0.101042 |  And Inter have to accept that they were a distant second best.
[11458.10 - 11462.10] P:1681.99 E:0.108301 |  Losing in this final for the second time in three years.
[11462.10 - 11465.10] P:1655.18 E:0.104274 |  But tonight was PSG's night.
[11465.10 - 11469.10] P:1562.51 E:0.104731 |  And a perfect Paris Saint-Germain this evening.
[11469.10 - 11471.10] P:1482.10 E:0.104126 |  What a performance!
[11471.10 - 11473.10] P:1508.36 E:0.117946 |  Blew away a wily old Inter team.
[11473.10 - 11477.10] P:1401.70 E:0.106905 |  He talks about the flair and the flamboyance,
[11477.10 - 11479.10] P:1550.47 E:0.100560 |  but this is a Paris Saint-Germain team
[11479.10 - 11482.10] P:1563.39 E:0.103039 |  who fight as well when out of possession,
[11482.10 - 11484.10] P:1610.19 E:0.093794 |  and they suffocate Inter.
[11484.10 - 11486.10] P:1455.79 E:0.087553 |  And let me just describe this,
[11486.10 - 11490.10] P:1526.19 E:0.105808 |  because Luis Enrique is leaving the celebrations now.
[11490.10 - 11491.10] P:1421.67 E:0.100909 |  And what celebrations?
[11491.10 - 11493.10] P:1642.45 E:0.098588 |  He's won the Champions League before,
[11493.10 - 11495.10] P:1631.52 E:0.104865 |  but he won it with Barcelona.
[11495.10 - 11497.10] P:1608.55 E:0.100554 |  This is the team that he built,
[11497.10 - 11500.10] P:1701.31 E:0.102313 |  and he is right at the front of this in his black T-shirt.
[11500.10 - 11503.10] P:1788.28 E:0.105325 |  He's down there, although the player's following him.
[11503.10 - 11506.10] P:1635.57 E:0.089921 |  He's like the Piper of Munich,
[11506.10 - 11508.10] P:1601.21 E:0.102848 |  and he's dancing and he's punching the air.
[11508.10 - 11510.10] P:1676.79 E:0.105561 |  The smile on his face.
[11510.10 - 11512.10] P:1568.64 E:0.090965 |  I think probably everyone knows the Agnes
[11512.10 - 11515.10] P:1748.84 E:0.100961 |  and the personal tragedy that he has come through.
[11515.10 - 11518.10] P:1573.17 E:0.096365 |  Well, tonight is a night that he can really enjoy this,
[11518.10 - 11521.10] P:1640.03 E:0.105617 |  because he is the architect.
[11521.10 - 11523.10] P:1569.57 E:0.093205 |  Qatar may have provided the money for this,
[11523.10 - 11525.10] P:1621.87 E:0.089047 |  and eventually the ship has come in,
[11525.10 - 11528.10] P:1626.27 E:0.102071 |  but they needed Luis Enrique to do it, Chris.
[11528.10 - 11530.10] P:1501.94 E:0.092268 |  Yeah, and guide them.
[11530.10 - 11532.10] P:1567.69 E:0.107453 |  He has...
[11532.10 - 11534.10] P:1675.14 E:0.104078 |  Even in his wildest dreams,
[11534.10 - 11537.10] P:1725.77 E:0.107534 |  I don't think he would have seen this dominance this evening,
[11537.10 - 11540.10] P:1769.32 E:0.097883 |  this scoreline against an Inter team
[11540.10 - 11543.10] P:1684.02 E:0.108865 |  who have been excellent in this competition,
[11543.10 - 11546.10] P:1721.63 E:0.102511 |  but there's ways to win a football match,
[11546.10 - 11549.10] P:1675.44 E:0.097934 |  there's ways to win a final in Blimey.
[11549.10 - 11551.10] P:1507.68 E:0.085685 |  That was one of them.
[11551.10 - 11553.10] P:1675.28 E:0.095238 |  They barely put a foot wrong.
[11553.10 - 11556.10] P:1619.45 E:0.093877 |  In every area, every aspect of the team,
[11556.10 - 11559.10] P:1581.73 E:0.099395 |  they were dominant, and this is a young team.
[11559.10 - 11561.10] P:1500.81 E:0.097763 |  Maybe this is just the start.
[11561.10 - 11564.10] P:1250.23 E:0.117028 |  Yep, in January,
[11564.10 - 11568.10] P:1399.31 E:0.100053 |  we thought they might be going out of the competition all together,
[11568.10 - 11572.10] P:1484.16 E:0.103840 |  but then they gave Manchester City a good hiding
[11572.10 - 11574.10] P:1367.95 E:0.104368 |  and just went on from there.
[11574.10 - 11576.10] P:1580.24 E:0.094183 |  They rescued their Champions League season.
[11576.10 - 11579.10] P:1362.30 E:0.106067 |  They knocked out Liverpool, the number one seed.
[11579.10 - 11581.10] P:1502.82 E:0.098418 |  They knocked out Aston Villa.
[11581.10 - 11585.10] P:1588.11 E:0.101780 |  They knocked out Arsenal, and here in the final in Munich,
[11585.10 - 11588.10] P:1641.88 E:0.090228 |  well, they've knocked Inter out of the park.
[11588.10 - 11591.10] P:1720.89 E:0.097280 |  Paris Saint-Germain 5-0.
[11591.10 - 11593.10] P:1801.22 E:0.098898 |  It's the extraordinary final score
[11593.10 - 11597.10] P:1754.83 E:0.091114 |  to this 2025 Champions League final.
[11598.10 - 11603.10] P:1539.29 E:0.101763 |  And Steve Crossman, like the rest of us, is wondering how has that happened?
[11603.10 - 11607.10] P:1434.94 E:0.114444 |  Absolutely astonishing.
[11607.10 - 11613.10] P:1453.97 E:0.101828 |  For the first time since Benfica, 1962,
[11613.10 - 11618.10] P:1635.03 E:0.106182 |  Eusebio Etal, a team of scored five goals in the European Cup final.
[11618.10 - 11621.10] P:1449.02 E:0.090102 |  And it's Paris Saint-Germain.
[11621.10 - 11623.10] P:1573.21 E:0.092885 |  And John Murray asked the question,
[11623.10 - 11629.10] P:1537.23 E:0.097544 |  as the PSG players celebrate on the far side in front of 70 or 80,
[11629.10 - 11632.10] P:1741.65 E:0.093924 |  right at the police, there's no sign of any issues with the PSG fans
[11632.10 - 11637.10] P:1601.63 E:0.092357 |  beyond the obvious, beyond the flares that are going off behind the goal at the minute.
[11637.10 - 11640.10] P:1753.66 E:0.092577 |  He asked the question, if you were a PSG supporter,
[11640.10 - 11644.10] P:1631.63 E:0.084874 |  you could be forgiven for thinking this might not happen.
[11644.10 - 11647.10] P:1548.68 E:0.075633 |  Julian LeRon, that just happened.
[11647.10 - 11649.10] P:1582.39 E:0.114267 |  I still can't really believe it.
[11649.10 - 11653.10] P:1644.78 E:0.097141 |  My eyes are so full of tears still,
[11653.10 - 11657.10] P:1619.93 E:0.089870 |  but this is probably the greatest performance I've seen from a team ever.
[11657.10 - 11663.10] P:1576.90 E:0.085947 |  And this is my team in the Champions League final with my sons in the stands.
[11663.10 - 11669.10] P:1589.26 E:0.094046 |  It's a day that I never thought I would see really after all the pains and all those years,
[11669.10 - 11674.10] P:1583.85 E:0.089795 |  40 years, 40 years I was waiting for this, and now it's here, and it's just exceptional.
[11674.10 - 11677.10] P:1700.50 E:0.081142 |  And I never thought that the game could be so good,
[11677.10 - 11681.10] P:1683.41 E:0.095055 |  and it could go all like that, and all the stress and everything,
[11681.10 - 11683.10] P:1466.70 E:0.094710 |  but they've done it, they're a wonderful team,
[11683.10 - 11687.10] P:1605.90 E:0.088686 |  and Luis Enrique is a wonderful coach, and they deserve it all.
[11687.10 - 11690.10] P:1786.94 E:0.078878 |  But it's just an exceptional night.
[11690.10 - 11694.10] P:1782.59 E:0.095235 |  I've just seen Steve Luis Enrique tearing his shirt off,
[11694.10 - 11697.10] P:1768.87 E:0.085351 |  just like Dewey did when he scored the goal.
[11697.10 - 11702.10] P:1811.93 E:0.100907 |  And you don't see many 55-year-old managers tearing their shirts off.
[11702.10 - 11704.10] P:1671.89 E:0.069934 |  So whatever happens?
[11704.10 - 11708.10] P:1817.22 E:0.095473 |  If I was doing the Iron Man that he was doing, I might, I might, but I'm not.
[11708.10 - 11711.10] P:1802.94 E:0.092135 |  Goodness me, you spoke to him, Jules, in the week.
[11711.10 - 11716.10] P:1647.20 E:0.090333 |  You said to Luis Enrique, what would it mean to Paris for this to happen?
[11716.10 - 11720.10] P:1760.48 E:0.094249 |  And he gave you a look, which kind of said, well, you tell me, so you tell us.
[11720.10 - 11726.10] P:1541.98 E:0.086012 |  I think it means everything to the city and to those fans and to the club.
[11726.10 - 11729.10] P:1543.32 E:0.089953 |  And they've been chasing here for so long,
[11729.10 - 11732.10] P:1679.73 E:0.086756 |  even back in the 90s with David Genolan and George Weyer,
[11732.10 - 11734.10] P:1420.03 E:0.100657 |  and the fans have always been there.
[11734.10 - 11736.10] P:1272.02 E:0.104064 |  And then, yeah, the Catari arrived with their money,
[11736.10 - 11740.10] P:1637.68 E:0.088172 |  and they tried, as we explained earlier, by splashing money at it,
[11740.10 - 11744.10] P:1581.57 E:0.104079 |  trying to almost buy this trophy here, the Holy Grail.
[11744.10 - 11748.10] P:1620.78 E:0.084538 |  And then for them to change direction, invest in youth,
[11748.10 - 11750.10] P:1680.82 E:0.091089 |  still spending money, of course,
[11750.10 - 11754.10] P:1698.32 E:0.088328 |  but going for something that looks more like a team than ever before,
[11754.10 - 11757.10] P:1724.47 E:0.099743 |  and doing it on that first year, really,
[11757.10 - 11759.10] P:1758.50 E:0.082463 |  with the youngest team in the competition.
[11759.10 - 11762.10] P:1732.92 E:0.092472 |  And the football that they played, it's not just the age,
[11762.10 - 11764.10] P:1784.41 E:0.091461 |  it's just the football that they played.
[11764.10 - 11767.10] P:1790.05 E:0.080320 |  John was mentioning the team that they beat along the way
[11767.10 - 11770.10] P:1670.90 E:0.091522 |  since they turned that game around against Manchester City in January,
[11770.10 - 11773.10] P:1639.18 E:0.085333 |  and they were just outstanding.
[11773.10 - 11775.10] P:1598.72 E:0.100862 |  They played football the right way.
[11775.10 - 11777.10] P:1580.90 E:0.091845 |  That's what people like them.
[11777.10 - 11780.10] P:1654.32 E:0.089672 |  They are likeable now, because the football is great.
[11780.10 - 11782.10] P:1801.74 E:0.083299 |  Everything they do is great.
[11782.10 - 11784.10] P:1813.60 E:0.091629 |  Luis Enrique put his top back on then,
[11784.10 - 11788.10] P:1860.13 E:0.090832 |  and he was thrown up in the air by all of the Paris Saint-Germain players
[11788.10 - 11792.10] P:1765.46 E:0.090950 |  in a big ring, and eventually they caught him and put him down on the floor.
[11792.10 - 11795.10] P:1785.31 E:0.090049 |  That's a great point, Jules, what you say there about,
[11795.10 - 11800.10] P:1701.52 E:0.084756 |  actually, he's made, he's made, they've made PSG likeable.
[11800.10 - 11804.10] P:1761.62 E:0.087275 |  You know, because people generally, I think it's fair to say,
[11804.10 - 11808.10] P:1598.64 E:0.095218 |  don't like the clubs, the Newtols don't like the clubs
[11808.10 - 11810.10] P:1688.28 E:0.095307 |  that have taken the petrol money.
[11810.10 - 11815.10] P:1675.55 E:0.082091 |  But what he's done has definitely changed the perspective on that club.
[11815.10 - 11816.10] P:1609.87 E:0.120653 |  Yeah, I agree.
[11816.10 - 11819.10] P:1647.07 E:0.069742 |  For a long time people were saying,
[11819.10 - 11824.10] P:1623.15 E:0.097409 |  this is a plastic club almost, it's not a very old club per se,
[11824.10 - 11827.10] P:1611.81 E:0.081541 |  because they merged and they were formed in 1970
[11827.10 - 11829.10] P:1702.95 E:0.098227 |  from two clubs in Paris already,
[11829.10 - 11832.10] P:1774.32 E:0.094660 |  but still it's not the same history as in Inter Milan
[11832.10 - 11834.10] P:1473.50 E:0.102953 |  or as Real Madrid or Barcelona.
[11834.10 - 11837.10] P:1718.97 E:0.084651 |  I get that, and because they were spending that money
[11837.10 - 11840.10] P:1826.26 E:0.092673 |  trying to assemble the team with great players
[11840.10 - 11843.10] P:1609.71 E:0.087676 |  because they thought this is how we can win the Champions League,
[11843.10 - 11847.10] P:1673.77 E:0.088876 |  people didn't like them, and I can completely understand it.
[11847.10 - 11851.10] P:1556.87 E:0.084396 |  And also they were not, they didn't look like a team either,
[11851.10 - 11853.10] P:1339.95 E:0.078714 |  they didn't have the mentality of a team.
[11853.10 - 11857.10] P:1578.59 E:0.086923 |  Everything that this team has was not there for the last 14 years,
[11857.10 - 11859.10] P:1759.41 E:0.083758 |  pretty much, or not all of it.
[11859.10 - 11861.10] P:1705.53 E:0.080815 |  And now they've done it.
[11861.10 - 11863.10] P:1804.40 E:0.100214 |  That jigsaw that we mentioned before the game,
[11863.10 - 11865.10] P:1461.32 E:0.090640 |  all those little pieces, some bigger than others,
[11865.10 - 11867.10] P:1703.25 E:0.095638 |  even Brazkeliah, who by the way,
[11867.10 - 11870.10] P:1677.29 E:0.092654 |  will end the season with a Serie A medal,
[11870.10 - 11873.10] P:1647.17 E:0.090908 |  a Ligue 1 medal, a French Cup medal,
[11873.10 - 11875.10] P:1476.82 E:0.075291 |  and a Champions League medal.
[11875.10 - 11880.10] P:1567.56 E:0.090961 |  This is the last piece of that jigsaw that arrived in January,
[11880.10 - 11883.10] P:1708.20 E:0.082491 |  but all those pieces fit it together.
[11883.10 - 11886.10] P:1662.51 E:0.097421 |  And recent weekend, 10 years on, his daughter passed away,
[11886.10 - 11889.10] P:1725.79 E:0.094517 |  she's not here with us tonight, but she was there 10 years ago,
[11889.10 - 11892.10] P:1593.95 E:0.090311 |  Sana, and 10 years on, he wins another treble,
[11892.10 - 11895.10] P:1687.65 E:0.090395 |  only the second manager in history to do that with Pep,
[11895.10 - 11897.10] P:1639.25 E:0.076138 |  and he's the Munich Magic again,
[11897.10 - 11901.10] P:1660.72 E:0.081689 |  for the fifth time, a first time winner is crowned here.
[11901.10 - 11902.10] P:1901.05 E:0.077084 |  It's just special.
[11902.10 - 11906.10] P:1830.06 E:0.085235 |  Jules, I think it's really telling that only now are the cameras
[11906.10 - 11909.10] P:1714.46 E:0.097932 |  starting to focus on other players like Donnarumma, like Dua,
[11909.10 - 11912.10] P:1677.90 E:0.079805 |  like Akimi and Kvaret Skelia,
[11912.10 - 11918.10] P:1761.61 E:0.081912 |  because this just feel like the Luis Enrique story by a distance.
[11918.10 - 11920.10] P:1652.38 E:0.074261 |  I'm not even sure it's close.
[11920.10 - 11922.10] P:1499.87 E:0.104357 |  I said to him 10 days ago, I said to him,
[11922.10 - 11925.10] P:1685.60 E:0.082691 |  I know you're not going to agree with me,
[11925.10 - 11928.10] P:1593.66 E:0.075785 |  but this is the Luis Enrique project for me.
[11928.10 - 11930.10] P:1589.28 E:0.082447 |  And he smiled and he said, you know,
[11930.10 - 11933.10] P:1588.58 E:0.084203 |  and I know exactly what he was going to say,
[11933.10 - 11934.10] P:1521.04 E:0.098940 |  because it's not him.
[11934.10 - 11936.10] P:1638.69 E:0.093218 |  We mentioned before, Nasser El Khalayfi, the president,
[11936.10 - 11938.10] P:1680.16 E:0.086454 |  who's been there since day one, Luis Campos,
[11938.10 - 11941.10] P:1692.26 E:0.092673 |  that we see on the page, a sporting director,
[11941.10 - 11944.10] P:1484.16 E:0.080154 |  who went to get patched and tried to fight for that,
[11944.10 - 11947.10] P:1490.13 E:0.068543 |  maybe not many people have heard of before.
[11947.10 - 11949.10] P:1596.86 E:0.096702 |  And Joe Neves, Benfica are 19,
[11949.10 - 11951.10] P:1211.76 E:0.092533 |  there may be not many other people have heard before,
[11951.10 - 11953.10] P:1680.22 E:0.079956 |  or Desiree Dwayne, even.
[11953.10 - 11955.10] P:1738.43 E:0.080857 |  It's them, it's not just Luis Enrique,
[11955.10 - 11957.10] P:1697.17 E:0.080134 |  but Luis Enrique is the architect.
[11957.10 - 11960.10] P:1691.74 E:0.086941 |  He is the one who drew the plans,
[11960.10 - 11963.10] P:1602.61 E:0.079403 |  drew the style and the philosophy,
[11963.10 - 11968.10] P:1586.57 E:0.088370 |  who put all of that together for them to be incredible with the ball,
[11968.10 - 11973.10] P:1617.68 E:0.078650 |  very good without the ball, balance and structured and clever,
[11973.10 - 11977.10] P:1609.60 E:0.089637 |  and with technical ability and with the right fitness too,
[11977.10 - 11978.10] P:1648.97 E:0.073674 |  just perfect.
[11978.10 - 11980.10] P:1572.96 E:0.090236 |  And the way he changed with Man Dembélé,
[11980.10 - 11981.10] P:1710.79 E:0.098389 |  what he did with Dwayne,
[11981.10 - 11984.10] P:1672.21 E:0.090423 |  you can look at every single player on the pitch tonight,
[11984.10 - 11985.10] P:1476.08 E:0.097193 |  he's improved them this season.
[11985.10 - 11989.10] P:1698.09 E:0.086295 |  From where they were back in August to the 31st of May,
[11989.10 - 11992.10] P:1590.72 E:0.076361 |  they've all become better, thanks to Luis Enrique.
[11992.10 - 11994.10] P:1903.80 E:0.106462 |  Meanwhile, James Horncastle, as we look away
[11994.10 - 11998.10] P:1702.00 E:0.081139 |  to the right-hand side of the pitch, the interplayers,
[11998.10 - 12001.10] P:1677.48 E:0.085033 |  goodness me, they're all so still,
[12001.10 - 12003.10] P:1699.81 E:0.084033 |  they were down on their knees and down on the floor
[12003.10 - 12007.10] P:1637.35 E:0.084626 |  and there were tears, now they are standing in the centre-circle,
[12007.10 - 12009.10] P:1571.36 E:0.085874 |  like statues.
[12009.10 - 12011.10] P:1344.81 E:0.107104 |  Because they didn't want to feel this way again,
[12011.10 - 12014.10] P:1519.82 E:0.094327 |  that was the entire point of getting back here.
[12014.10 - 12017.10] P:1489.82 E:0.115397 |  Hacanchalinolu there, Mithbill Blair said yesterday
[12017.10 - 12019.10] P:1605.47 E:0.093465 |  that it was the second chance,
[12019.10 - 12022.10] P:1436.24 E:0.104148 |  I think they all realised that it was also their last chance,
[12022.10 - 12026.10] P:1399.69 E:0.104984 |  and I think that's why the tears are the same as in Istanbul,
[12026.10 - 12030.10] P:1289.78 E:0.096853 |  the pain is the same, but it's different, it cuts deeper.
[12030.10 - 12034.10] P:1582.01 E:0.091610 |  I think Jules was talking about how this Paris Saint-Germain team
[12034.10 - 12037.10] P:1558.35 E:0.083892 |  had the youngest average age in this competition.
[12037.10 - 12040.10] P:1725.50 E:0.092613 |  When you've got Francesco Cedric, who's 36,
[12040.10 - 12042.10] P:1657.60 E:0.091182 |  when you've got Janssommo, who's around the same age,
[12042.10 - 12046.10] P:1717.47 E:0.083425 |  you've got six or seven core guys in that interteam
[12046.10 - 12049.10] P:1765.24 E:0.089169 |  who are in their 30s.
[12049.10 - 12052.10] P:1860.06 E:0.106184 |  Yet they appreciate that they might not get back here,
[12052.10 - 12055.10] P:1883.93 E:0.097539 |  that it took an awful lot to return to the Champions League
[12055.10 - 12057.10] P:1872.40 E:0.108064 |  final after two years ago.
[12057.10 - 12062.10] P:1941.91 E:0.091151 |  Jules mentioned how Piers Cedric had done it in getting here,
[12062.10 - 12065.10] P:1787.08 E:0.096081 |  you know, Inter, I think, felt that after knocking out Bayern,
[12065.10 - 12069.10] P:1735.85 E:0.082980 |  after knocking out Barcelona, they could beat anyone.
[12069.10 - 12072.10] P:1693.52 E:0.077329 |  But Piers Cedric was too much for them tonight,
[12072.10 - 12078.10] P:1753.64 E:0.089916 |  and I also wonder as well if they were too keenly aware
[12078.10 - 12080.10] P:1726.30 E:0.084592 |  that this was their last chance,
[12080.10 - 12084.10] P:1672.28 E:0.105917 |  and that that had some psychological impact on them tonight.
[12085.10 - 12089.10] P:1768.13 E:0.099419 |  Do you think there will be a little regret there
[12089.10 - 12092.10] P:1785.79 E:0.088865 |  as the Champions League trophy, the European Cup,
[12092.10 - 12094.10] P:1736.23 E:0.082566 |  is now brought out to that plinth,
[12094.10 - 12096.10] P:1776.10 E:0.094756 |  and in a moment they're going to have to walk past it, James,
[12096.10 - 12098.10] P:1733.65 E:0.092030 |  with their runners-up medals?
[12098.10 - 12101.10] P:1706.42 E:0.095877 |  Yeah, I mean, Jules, we're just saying that Javier Pastore
[12101.10 - 12103.10] P:1742.89 E:0.090038 |  bring out the trophy.
[12103.10 - 12107.10] P:1696.60 E:0.089381 |  Javier Pastore was the first player signed by Nassal Galefi
[12107.10 - 12110.10] P:1747.80 E:0.093591 |  as the guy who started this project.
[12110.10 - 12112.10] P:1681.54 E:0.090709 |  He was like, we don't want to sign Messi,
[12112.10 - 12115.10] P:1703.10 E:0.090053 |  we want the new Messi, and Pastore was supposed to be that,
[12115.10 - 12118.10] P:1575.48 E:0.092028 |  and instead we've maybe seen what Desiree Dua,
[12118.10 - 12121.10] P:1691.80 E:0.087561 |  and these guys are the new Messi.
[12121.10 - 12124.10] P:1602.55 E:0.101104 |  Yeah, and I guess it's a good symbol that Javier is here,
[12124.10 - 12127.10] P:1768.74 E:0.085074 |  and we see Dembele and Nassal Galefi
[12127.10 - 12130.10] P:1757.71 E:0.094604 |  with a massive hug on the stage before the referee
[12130.10 - 12132.10] P:1770.54 E:0.101917 |  go and collect the medal.
[12132.10 - 12136.10] P:1902.27 E:0.087321 |  It's a little bit of all of that, because this is his treat tonight,
[12136.10 - 12139.10] P:1775.95 E:0.091107 |  and Chris, at halftime, when I said the game is not over yet,
[12139.10 - 12141.10] P:1824.46 E:0.102905 |  surely, looked at me with these big eyes,
[12141.10 - 12143.10] P:1795.43 E:0.107756 |  and I knew exactly what I was thinking.
[12143.10 - 12145.10] P:1799.66 E:0.090326 |  The PSG have been there before.
[12145.10 - 12147.10] P:1715.91 E:0.104634 |  PSG is the remontana where Barcelona,
[12147.10 - 12150.10] P:1704.16 E:0.090990 |  after winning the first leg, fornir, losing 6-1.
[12150.10 - 12153.10] P:1760.93 E:0.089167 |  PSG is the defeat against Manchester United,
[12153.10 - 12156.10] P:1806.74 E:0.090521 |  the Parc de France and the Oleg Gnar Solskjaer.
[12156.10 - 12160.10] P:1678.34 E:0.090543 |  We've been here before, their hearts have been broken so many times,
[12160.10 - 12165.10] P:1612.89 E:0.083271 |  but finally, to get past that final hurdle,
[12165.10 - 12168.10] P:1806.17 E:0.083303 |  and to make it, and to finally win this trophy,
[12168.10 - 12171.10] P:1770.72 E:0.086771 |  and also for French football in general, this is great.
[12171.10 - 12173.10] P:1860.12 E:0.086204 |  I know the Farmers League nickname,
[12173.10 - 12177.10] P:1652.93 E:0.094958 |  that it has how people see it, people don't even watch it.
[12177.10 - 12181.10] P:1752.93 E:0.082585 |  Sometimes I get that, but it was 32 years since Marseille won
[12181.10 - 12184.10] P:1673.74 E:0.095897 |  the only championship that French football had ever won.
[12184.10 - 12187.10] P:1789.77 E:0.093229 |  Here in Munich, down the road at the Olympic Stadium,
[12187.10 - 12191.10] P:1818.97 E:0.093675 |  and I think really it was long due for French football
[12191.10 - 12193.10] P:1862.86 E:0.085062 |  to get another one.
[12193.10 - 12196.10] P:1806.52 E:0.099741 |  Luis Enrique is still going absolutely crazy.
[12196.10 - 12200.10] P:1926.75 E:0.097416 |  He's part of a big guard of honour that's been formed,
[12200.10 - 12202.10] P:1978.24 E:0.093040 |  ever thus in big finals.
[12202.10 - 12204.10] P:1856.87 E:0.093096 |  The Paris Saint-Germain players standing on either side
[12204.10 - 12207.10] P:1889.82 E:0.099476 |  and applauding as the Inter players in their yellow shirts
[12207.10 - 12209.10] P:1912.36 E:0.088159 |  go walking through them.
[12209.10 - 12213.10] P:1908.55 E:0.091805 |  Lautaro Martinez is right at the head of the queue there,
[12213.10 - 12215.10] P:1793.92 E:0.081880 |  and he shakes hands with Nasser Al-Khalifi,
[12215.10 - 12218.10] P:1893.94 E:0.096094 |  the PSG owner, a Chirby is next to him as well,
[12218.10 - 12221.10] P:1862.12 E:0.089526 |  and now they begin to get those runners-up medals.
[12221.10 - 12223.10] P:1922.52 E:0.094696 |  And this, I always think, is just a heartbreaking moment,
[12223.10 - 12230.10] P:1807.98 E:0.083444 |  because they are three, four, five metres from the European Cup, James,
[12230.10 - 12234.10] P:1810.01 E:0.089866 |  and a lot of them know that as close as they will ever get.
[12235.10 - 12239.10] P:1833.25 E:0.099349 |  It is, and they were talking about this being the only thing
[12239.10 - 12242.10] P:1722.65 E:0.089914 |  that they were missing to be fulfilled in their careers,
[12242.10 - 12246.10] P:1735.60 E:0.083261 |  because as a group, and they are a really good group of lads,
[12246.10 - 12249.10] P:1768.86 E:0.083955 |  you know, in terms of the team spirit, the team ethic that they've got,
[12249.10 - 12254.10] P:1868.53 E:0.083348 |  in terms of all being great friends, wanting to go that extra yard for each other,
[12254.10 - 12257.10] P:1781.41 E:0.079856 |  this was all that they were missing.
[12257.10 - 12260.10] P:1741.41 E:0.092001 |  They've won the league, they've won the cup, they've won the Super Cup,
[12260.10 - 12263.10] P:1732.69 E:0.085929 |  they've been to a Europa League final, they've been to a Champions League final,
[12263.10 - 12265.10] P:1750.81 E:0.081893 |  they just wanted to lift that trophy.
[12265.10 - 12268.10] P:1782.86 E:0.089347 |  And again, as was the case two years ago,
[12268.10 - 12272.10] P:1544.79 E:0.086938 |  they have to stand and stare as someone else is dancing,
[12272.10 - 12277.10] P:1771.68 E:0.092131 |  someone else is singing as Julien Neurons is jumping up and down in the press stand.
[12279.10 - 12286.10] P:1755.66 E:0.084517 |  And they know that, yeah, leaving aside what winning this trophy would have done for Inter,
[12286.10 - 12293.10] P:1638.32 E:0.084653 |  just consider their last week, losing the title on the final day of the season.
[12293.10 - 12297.10] P:1656.03 E:0.103890 |  That's the second time that's happened to Inter in the last three years,
[12297.10 - 12302.10] P:1884.29 E:0.111387 |  losing the Champions League for the second time in three years in the final.
[12302.10 - 12307.10] P:1892.90 E:0.102261 |  Yes, this, it was very curious to hear some of the journalistic questions yesterday
[12307.10 - 12312.10] P:1853.08 E:0.088839 |  to say, Nicola Barela, you've lost a lot in your career, haven't you?
[12312.10 - 12316.10] P:1807.89 E:0.093929 |  They have, you know, they've won a lot, but they've lost a lot.
[12316.10 - 12320.10] P:1846.09 E:0.088951 |  And it's just part of sport, that's what we love about it.
[12320.10 - 12325.10] P:1822.65 E:0.097356 |  Lewis Enrique has just given the biggest hug to Nassar Al-Khalifi.
[12325.10 - 12330.10] P:1904.14 E:0.092584 |  He's walked past the European Cup and he's rubbing his hands together.
[12330.10 - 12332.10] P:1927.26 E:0.076861 |  John Murray, it's almost time.
[12332.10 - 12336.10] P:1880.38 E:0.106289 |  Well, what they're supposed to do here is, they're supposed to receive their medals,
[12336.10 - 12342.10] P:1849.23 E:0.092687 |  give their thank yous and then go and stand on a stage over to the right.
[12342.10 - 12344.10] P:1997.88 E:0.101855 |  They cannot leave that trophy alone.
[12344.10 - 12348.10] P:1917.03 E:0.100244 |  Lewis Enrique, who was the first man up, who was given,
[12348.10 - 12351.10] P:1936.47 E:0.101273 |  who walked through all of the PSG players, who slapped them on the back.
[12351.10 - 12355.10] P:1839.03 E:0.098467 |  He actually stood behind the plin, behind the trophy,
[12355.10 - 12359.10] P:1840.74 E:0.094584 |  which has the red and blue ribbons on it,
[12359.10 - 12362.10] P:1862.19 E:0.108963 |  clapped his hands together and the other players just joined in there.
[12362.10 - 12365.10] P:1820.41 E:0.096932 |  Only now, actually, have they begun to move away.
[12365.10 - 12367.10] P:1840.24 E:0.105220 |  And very soon, we will have that moment.
[12367.10 - 12371.10] P:1946.22 E:0.098283 |  And what a fitting man it is for PSG to lift the trophy here.
[12371.10 - 12376.10] P:1917.10 E:0.092683 |  Marquinhos, who is waiting at the end of the line to do just that.
[12376.10 - 12383.10] P:1882.69 E:0.092724 |  And that exchange as well between the PSG president, Nassar Al-Khalifi,
[12383.10 - 12386.10] P:1918.32 E:0.096782 |  that smiles the unadulterated joy.
[12386.10 - 12388.10] P:1915.57 E:0.108981 |  And now it's Marquinhos.
[12388.10 - 12393.10] P:1945.42 E:0.093512 |  Marquinhos steps up there onto the blue stage
[12393.10 - 12398.10] P:1900.38 E:0.089169 |  and there's the hug between the captain and the president together.
[12398.10 - 12401.10] P:1754.55 E:0.102630 |  He slaps them on the back, he cuddles him.
[12401.10 - 12406.10] P:1885.79 E:0.104862 |  And Marquinhos now moves over to the UEFA president,
[12406.10 - 12410.10] P:1637.62 E:0.092431 |  Alexander Cheferin, and has that medal put around his neck.
[12410.10 - 12416.10] P:1686.18 E:0.087828 |  Marquinhos, the number five, 12 years at the club, captain for five years.
[12416.10 - 12419.10] P:1576.27 E:0.114005 |  He thought this day might never come.
[12419.10 - 12424.10] P:1628.65 E:0.104981 |  They all thought this day might never come.
[12424.10 - 12428.10] P:1555.43 E:0.112844 |  But here it is on the last day of May, 2025.
[12428.10 - 12432.10] P:1665.35 E:0.104081 |  It finally comes to pass for Paris Saint-Germain,
[12432.10 - 12436.10] P:1539.07 E:0.107008 |  as Marquinhos walks the trophy across
[12436.10 - 12441.10] P:1490.62 E:0.122537 |  and raises it above his head to signify
[12442.10 - 12446.10] P:1667.53 E:0.103542 |  that Paris Saint-Germain, a champion of Europe,
[12446.10 - 12452.10] P:1692.78 E:0.101941 |  dominant in France for so long with all of their Qatar riches.
[12452.10 - 12457.10] P:1677.69 E:0.102956 |  They were in danger of going out of this competition in January,
[12457.10 - 12462.10] P:1760.79 E:0.101132 |  but here they are now at the end of May with the trophy in their hands.
[12462.10 - 12468.10] P:1703.39 E:0.103811 |  And in Munich we have Paris Saint-Germain as first-time winners,
[12468.10 - 12473.10] P:1771.63 E:0.106520 |  and finally the second French club to win it, both here in Munich.
[12473.10 - 12478.10] P:1684.10 E:0.089654 |  Marseille held that position for so many years,
[12478.10 - 12483.10] P:1733.99 E:0.098174 |  but now Paris Saint-Germain can say they have won the European Cup
[12483.10 - 12487.10] P:1792.67 E:0.110525 |  and the scenes of celebration in front of the stage.
[12487.10 - 12491.10] P:1790.59 E:0.104174 |  Behind them on the arch it says PSG winners,
[12491.10 - 12494.10] P:1822.97 E:0.097043 |  and that is precisely what they are.
[12494.10 - 12496.10] P:1752.43 E:0.084859 |  The shape all over the place.
[12496.10 - 12499.10] P:1768.10 E:0.097408 |  Champions League theme playing,
[12499.10 - 12503.10] P:1692.64 E:0.107718 |  and big French smiles everywhere you look.
[12507.10 - 12510.10] P:1733.79 E:0.086448 |  Chris Sutton, there goes that glass ceiling.
[12510.10 - 12513.10] P:1801.37 E:0.089478 |  Yeah, absolutely.
[12513.10 - 12515.10] P:1782.29 E:0.095868 |  You know, it's what happens next.
[12515.10 - 12518.10] P:1634.58 E:0.088522 |  I mean, astonishing performance in the final,
[12518.10 - 12522.10] P:1741.90 E:0.099775 |  but talk about, you know, owning the right, the hard yards,
[12522.10 - 12525.10] P:1692.28 E:0.089786 |  and the three English sides which they beat
[12525.10 - 12528.10] P:1635.90 E:0.101823 |  and how they had to show that resilience to get here.
[12528.10 - 12532.10] P:1555.99 E:0.093828 |  But then to perform as they did do with that confidence,
[12532.10 - 12535.10] P:1743.43 E:0.101492 |  that class, that belief, that energy.
[12535.10 - 12541.10] P:1844.81 E:0.110099 |  And as I say, this could go on for many a season.
[12541.10 - 12545.10] P:1834.66 E:0.103446 |  And English clubs will be looking at this PSG team and thinking,
[12545.10 - 12548.10] P:1765.87 E:0.101227 |  if they stay together they could even strengthen,
[12548.10 - 12551.10] P:1548.18 E:0.084366 |  then they're going to take some beating.
[12552.10 - 12555.10] P:1898.73 E:0.111114 |  Well, everyone is having a go on the trophy,
[12555.10 - 12557.10] P:1828.47 E:0.100922 |  and there's Lewis Enrique,
[12557.10 - 12561.10] P:1817.57 E:0.102818 |  and now he's on the shoulders of his players,
[12561.10 - 12566.10] P:1740.83 E:0.106252 |  hoisting the trophy above his head with the red and the blue ribbons.
[12566.10 - 12570.10] P:1699.45 E:0.098129 |  He's been here before, he's seen it all before,
[12570.10 - 12574.10] P:1926.08 E:0.097947 |  and yet still he's looking through watery eyes
[12574.10 - 12576.10] P:1800.66 E:0.087530 |  at that famous trophy.
[12576.10 - 12579.10] P:1496.40 E:0.102020 |  And now it's the club president, Nasser Al-Khalifi,
[12579.10 - 12581.10] P:1764.84 E:0.091664 |  who's hoisted up on the shoulders.
[12581.10 - 12584.10] P:1811.93 E:0.086394 |  I wouldn't drop him, that would be very, very expensive.
[12584.10 - 12586.10] P:1805.65 E:0.091452 |  He's got a winners medal on as well.
[12586.10 - 12587.10] P:1944.47 E:0.073549 |  And I'm just looking, James,
[12587.10 - 12590.10] P:1930.91 E:0.086991 |  and a couple of the interplayers have actually stayed behind.
[12590.10 - 12594.10] P:1766.01 E:0.079333 |  And it's that sort of strange thing, isn't it?
[12594.10 - 12598.10] P:1923.34 E:0.087150 |  Sometimes they just feel runners-up in this situation
[12598.10 - 12602.10] P:1738.75 E:0.080434 |  that they have to stay, albeit it feels like they can't watch.
[12602.10 - 12605.10] P:1476.84 E:0.077132 |  Yeah, Nicola Barela is still out there.
[12605.10 - 12611.10] P:1506.23 E:0.083269 |  And Barela is one of the players who has had most success,
[12611.10 - 12614.10] P:1801.91 E:0.103990 |  not only with Inter, but he was part of that Italy team
[12614.10 - 12617.10] P:1871.64 E:0.098818 |  that beat England in the European Championships.
[12617.10 - 12621.10] P:1801.25 E:0.099556 |  He has been on the other side of nights like this.
[12621.10 - 12625.10] P:1744.85 E:0.102491 |  But that is of no consolation for Barela.
[12625.10 - 12628.10] P:1795.91 E:0.091545 |  Who is one of the senior players?
[12628.10 - 12631.10] P:1801.45 E:0.105578 |  Not only for Inter, but for his country as well.
[12632.10 - 12637.10] P:1786.03 E:0.100068 |  And someone who, as with Alessandro Bastoni,
[12637.10 - 12639.10] P:1799.74 E:0.096815 |  Federico Di Marco,
[12639.10 - 12643.10] P:1886.07 E:0.107571 |  these players are good enough to play
[12643.10 - 12646.10] P:1801.70 E:0.095205 |  with some of the other top sides in the world.
[12646.10 - 12648.10] P:1917.22 E:0.098342 |  They could play in the Premier League,
[12648.10 - 12650.10] P:1840.78 E:0.105246 |  they could play with some of the big clubs in Spain.
[12650.10 - 12654.10] P:1787.18 E:0.100478 |  But for those three, there's nothing bigger for them
[12654.10 - 12658.10] P:1671.33 E:0.088719 |  than playing with and winning with Inter.
[12658.10 - 12662.10] P:1741.21 E:0.095365 |  And so it means that nights like tonight hurt all the harder.
[12662.10 - 12665.10] P:1924.39 E:0.096870 |  I'm just staring up at the roof of the Alianz Arena
[12665.10 - 12670.10] P:1834.73 E:0.093252 |  where there is that great imprinted Beckenbauer 5-shirt
[12670.10 - 12673.10] P:1972.88 E:0.089689 |  just staring back down at the pitch
[12673.10 - 12678.10] P:1825.53 E:0.100703 |  to see PSG's number five, to see Marquinhos lifting that trophy.
[12678.10 - 12682.10] P:1696.86 E:0.106023 |  He rubbed it in his hands like a magic lamp.
[12682.10 - 12687.10] P:1548.28 E:0.107444 |  And now the PSG players go sprinting through the pitch,
[12687.10 - 12689.10] P:1674.04 E:0.104777 |  through the line of Riot Police,
[12689.10 - 12692.10] P:1763.19 E:0.086167 |  who thankfully have been very, very much unnecessary
[12692.10 - 12695.10] P:1745.98 E:0.092071 |  over the course of the 20 minutes or so
[12695.10 - 12697.10] P:1824.31 E:0.089428 |  since the full-time whistle.
[12697.10 - 12701.10] P:1808.68 E:0.088710 |  And now they hold the trophy aloft right in front of their fans.
[12701.10 - 12706.10] P:1768.15 E:0.089271 |  There are knee slides, arms in aeroplane formation,
[12706.10 - 12710.10] P:1560.79 E:0.074502 |  heads in hands, people on the floor,
[12710.10 - 12713.10] P:1697.26 E:0.087726 |  people on the shoulders of teammates,
[12713.10 - 12716.10] P:1713.18 E:0.096986 |  wonderful images for everybody associated
[12716.10 - 12718.10] P:1587.78 E:0.085385 |  with Paris Saint-Germain.
[12718.10 - 12721.10] P:1663.68 E:0.100215 |  Chris, it's almost difficult to know which individual
[12721.10 - 12724.10] P:1526.73 E:0.083334 |  to pick out first, but this sort of feels like
[12724.10 - 12727.10] P:1967.80 E:0.097742 |  the Desiree-Douay final, doesn't it?
[12727.10 - 12732.10] P:1719.16 E:0.091113 |  Well, it does, because once he'd made his mark...
[12732.10 - 12735.10] P:1855.71 E:0.091295 |  The first goal, his composure for the first goal,
[12735.10 - 12738.10] P:1785.04 E:0.100006 |  I can't tell you how impressive that was.
[12738.10 - 12742.10] P:1829.01 E:0.099028 |  19-year-old, clever movement all night to drift
[12742.10 - 12744.10] P:1825.34 E:0.088792 |  across from the right to the left.
[12744.10 - 12747.10] P:1919.22 E:0.104495 |  And then, you know, my eyes would have lit up in that situation.
[12747.10 - 12750.10] P:1946.68 E:0.101172 |  That would have been all about me, Steve, trying to finish it myself.
[12750.10 - 12755.10] P:1945.43 E:0.094851 |  He didn't compose himself, realised Hakimi was in a much better position
[12755.10 - 12757.10] P:1723.05 E:0.089598 |  and just laid it on a plate for him.
[12757.10 - 12761.10] P:1725.51 E:0.098807 |  That was one that he got the second by a deflection.
[12761.10 - 12763.10] P:1845.80 E:0.096793 |  But all evening at that magic moment, didn't he,
[12763.10 - 12767.10] P:1735.50 E:0.096415 |  in the second half, a lovely little twirl and flick,
[12767.10 - 12769.10] P:1812.55 E:0.082884 |  a player full of confidence, full of it.
[12769.10 - 12775.10] P:1788.33 E:0.093087 |  Tucked his second goal away, PSG's third away with real composure.
[12775.10 - 12777.10] P:1828.10 E:0.074828 |  What a play he looks.
[12777.10 - 12780.10] P:1843.92 E:0.092183 |  You've got Kravitz-Skelier on the other side, who's a talent.
[12780.10 - 12783.10] P:1728.10 E:0.096153 |  Dembele's work great, what he brought for the team.
[12783.10 - 12789.10] P:1851.71 E:0.089363 |  The way he kept peeling off the intercenter halves into little pockets of space,
[12789.10 - 12791.10] P:1981.74 E:0.081982 |  getting things, linking the play-up.
[12791.10 - 12796.10] P:1919.08 E:0.089141 |  Vitiniar in the midfield, just making them tick, controlling the game.
[12796.10 - 12799.10] P:1951.12 E:0.085952 |  You've talked about the leadership at the back.
[12799.10 - 12806.10] P:1895.56 E:0.090179 |  There weren't any weak links, and for a team so young to show that composure,
[12806.10 - 12812.10] P:1788.54 E:0.089089 |  that belief, the way that they steamed away there to celebrate in front of the fans,
[12812.10 - 12815.10] P:1940.74 E:0.087838 |  they are a fit, energetic team.
[12815.10 - 12818.10] P:1851.74 E:0.090597 |  And you can't see anybody stopping them, really.
[12818.10 - 12822.10] P:1956.66 E:0.084998 |  There's a really, really powerful moment now,
[12822.10 - 12826.10] P:1948.38 E:0.084842 |  which is happening just away to our left-hand side.
[12826.10 - 12833.10] P:1872.82 E:0.075694 |  So there is a Paris Saint-Germain Tiffaux that has been unveiled to the left.
[12833.10 - 12836.10] P:1888.20 E:0.083392 |  And normally it's the kind of thing that they would only do pre-match,
[12836.10 - 12842.10] P:1835.97 E:0.079037 |  but they've obviously brought another one with them deliberately this afternoon.
[12842.10 - 12846.10] P:1797.01 E:0.078039 |  And it's just been laid out there, and it says Zanaroni,
[12846.10 - 12848.10] P:1896.08 E:0.082489 |  it's the name of Louis-Henriques' daughter.
[12848.10 - 12852.10] P:1763.37 E:0.081430 |  And she, of course, is no longer with us as Julianne Leron was saying before.
[12852.10 - 12856.10] P:1566.53 E:0.074822 |  And he is standing at the bottom, looking up at that.
[12856.10 - 12859.10] P:1739.49 E:0.084489 |  There's a number eight shirt on the back as well.
[12859.10 - 12863.10] P:1844.27 E:0.086990 |  And all of a sudden, the celebrations, which are so loud and so raucous,
[12863.10 - 12865.10] P:1549.10 E:0.060442 |  just move a little bit quieter.
[12865.10 - 12867.10] P:1625.12 E:0.080539 |  John, that's very powerful.
[12867.10 - 12871.10] P:1539.85 E:0.088393 |  Yeah, very. And I think he's almost been overwhelmed by it, actually, when he saw it.
[12871.10 - 12873.10] P:1525.35 E:0.092011 |  I mean, what a motions for him.
[12873.10 - 12877.10] P:1611.81 E:0.090061 |  Just watching here, we've got a little bit of a concerning situation
[12877.10 - 12881.10] P:1487.38 E:0.092896 |  because a number of the Paris Saint-Germain fans who were in the stands
[12881.10 - 12884.10] P:1483.20 E:0.091326 |  have now actually gone over the hoardings.
[12884.10 - 12888.10] P:1589.73 E:0.087707 |  And all of the players, and I can see the European club,
[12888.10 - 12891.10] P:1596.80 E:0.093012 |  Silva, Glinting, are way over on the far side,
[12891.10 - 12893.10] P:1631.68 E:0.092200 |  because that's where all of the players are.
[12893.10 - 12895.10] P:1495.91 E:0.079039 |  And many, many supporters.
[12895.10 - 12901.10] P:1509.83 E:0.086408 |  We've now got hundreds and hundreds of them who are going and joining in with this.
[12901.10 - 12904.10] P:1549.05 E:0.079741 |  You know, I'm sure it's all going to be good natured,
[12904.10 - 12909.10] P:1611.38 E:0.091684 |  but even so, I think in an ideal world, you would keep the fans in the crowd
[12909.10 - 12911.10] P:1447.55 E:0.082385 |  so everyone would be able to witness this.
[12911.10 - 12916.10] P:1474.80 E:0.089342 |  But more and more of them all at the same time are coming onto the field together.
[12916.10 - 12920.10] P:1593.74 E:0.088110 |  And I think the security forces down there that you've mentioned,
[12920.10 - 12922.10] P:1582.76 E:0.087842 |  which is quite surprising to see, actually,
[12922.10 - 12928.10] P:1717.94 E:0.081572 |  that we've got helmeted security people all in a line who are just next to it
[12928.10 - 12931.10] P:1683.53 E:0.090691 |  and are just trying to contain this.
[12931.10 - 12936.10] P:1658.10 E:0.083759 |  And actually, I think the team, the squad, the Paris Saint-Germain squad now
[12936.10 - 12942.10] P:1671.76 E:0.087573 |  have been advised and persuaded and asked to move out of that area
[12942.10 - 12944.10] P:1574.19 E:0.090254 |  and away from that stand.
[12944.10 - 12949.10] P:1681.90 E:0.086373 |  So we now have that line of police, I presume the police,
[12949.10 - 12952.10] P:1741.61 E:0.087524 |  certainly security personnel with these helmets,
[12952.10 - 12954.10] P:1776.86 E:0.080966 |  these black helmets and visors on,
[12954.10 - 12958.10] P:1816.83 E:0.088700 |  who are standing in a line across the penalty area
[12958.10 - 12960.10] P:1714.60 E:0.094493 |  and holding back the supporters.
[12960.10 - 12962.10] P:1759.34 E:0.089886 |  It's quite obvious who the supporters are,
[12962.10 - 12964.10] P:1778.55 E:0.100587 |  because they're either in white shirts or they're bare-shirted,
[12964.10 - 12969.10] P:1797.09 E:0.081131 |  whereas the PSG squad have moved away out of that area.
[12969.10 - 12973.10] P:1752.54 E:0.085531 |  Yeah, and it was only about two minutes before that happened
[12973.10 - 12976.10] P:1850.00 E:0.092955 |  that I was just saying that the police who were out there
[12976.10 - 12979.10] P:1719.17 E:0.089319 |  hadn't at that stage been needed, and now all of a sudden,
[12979.10 - 12982.10] P:1858.91 E:0.095211 |  there are absolutely hundreds and hundreds of fans on the pitch now,
[12982.10 - 12986.10] P:1841.79 E:0.074854 |  and it's almost like those being there have then convinced others
[12986.10 - 12988.10] P:1875.85 E:0.093614 |  that it's a good idea to go on.
[12988.10 - 12991.10] P:1871.69 E:0.084570 |  And the goal is actually being moved back and forward now
[12991.10 - 12994.10] P:1883.21 E:0.083307 |  by PSG fans under the weight of them.
[12994.10 - 12997.10] P:1881.26 E:0.084950 |  There are people hanging off the inside of the goal net as well,
[12997.10 - 13002.10] P:1864.09 E:0.080821 |  and now I can see that there's a real rush happening on the far side
[13002.10 - 13006.10] P:1702.89 E:0.072216 |  of supporters back into the stands,
[13006.10 - 13009.10] P:1944.76 E:0.085582 |  and that line of police is still long and straight,
[13009.10 - 13013.10] P:1799.40 E:0.077890 |  but all of a sudden, maybe like 20%, 15% of them
[13013.10 - 13016.10] P:1694.13 E:0.073557 |  have now disappeared back into the stands,
[13016.10 - 13020.10] P:1768.32 E:0.077114 |  and hopefully they can get the supporters off the pitch as quickly as possible,
[13020.10 - 13022.10] P:1757.94 E:0.090713 |  but there is still quite a lot on there.
[13022.10 - 13025.10] P:1750.91 E:0.083057 |  Yeah, meanwhile, looking to my right,
[13025.10 - 13029.10] P:1765.13 E:0.095247 |  the Paris Saint-Germain players at Al have now moved themselves
[13029.10 - 13032.10] P:1837.99 E:0.087212 |  all the way over to the area in front of the tunnel,
[13032.10 - 13037.10] P:1780.61 E:0.080482 |  and they're being ringed by stewards in pink bibs, actually.
[13037.10 - 13039.10] P:1851.94 E:0.091207 |  So there are still some celebrations going on there,
[13039.10 - 13042.10] P:1817.48 E:0.090377 |  but it does have a feel of the celebrations having been curtailed
[13042.10 - 13044.10] P:1771.04 E:0.077599 |  for the time being.
[13044.10 - 13047.10] P:1680.48 E:0.086063 |  And in fact, I think they are heading down the tunnel, aren't they?
[13047.10 - 13049.10] P:1966.63 E:0.096168 |  Yeah, well, normally, I mean, what time is it?
[13049.10 - 13050.10] P:1685.27 E:0.072132 |  17 minutes past the hour.
[13050.10 - 13053.10] P:1971.79 E:0.096537 |  Normally, at least through to about 40 minutes after a final,
[13053.10 - 13056.10] P:1780.23 E:0.082522 |  you would have players still celebrating on the pitch
[13056.10 - 13059.10] P:1707.21 E:0.086466 |  in front of supporters, but looks like that's not been possible.
[13059.10 - 13061.10] P:1829.99 E:0.093589 |  We can see shots from inside the tunnel here,
[13061.10 - 13064.10] P:1758.83 E:0.090539 |  where the PSG players are dancing down the tunnel now,
[13064.10 - 13066.10] P:1726.67 E:0.094195 |  heading toward the dressing room,
[13066.10 - 13069.10] P:1766.10 E:0.095103 |  where there will be party number two or five or six parties.
[13069.10 - 13073.10] P:1833.39 E:0.083188 |  That was a message over the PA system here inside the Allianz Arena.
[13073.10 - 13076.10] P:2010.78 E:0.089896 |  I assume something to the tune of, please get off the pitch.
[13076.10 - 13080.10] P:1930.20 E:0.083825 |  And actually, there's a line of stewards in front of the line of police.
[13080.10 - 13082.10] P:1884.51 E:0.077431 |  They've all got pink bibs on,
[13082.10 - 13086.10] P:1795.63 E:0.081869 |  and they're actually now just moving back the supporters
[13086.10 - 13089.10] P:1794.61 E:0.075245 |  all the way back towards the stands.
[13089.10 - 13093.10] P:1823.84 E:0.083408 |  So hopefully, they're able just to hop back over the hoardings there.
[13093.10 - 13096.10] P:1725.12 E:0.080644 |  Well, they're trying to force them back towards the stands,
[13096.10 - 13101.10] P:1548.52 E:0.080932 |  but I can see still plenty of people who are jumping down from the stands
[13101.10 - 13105.10] P:1681.36 E:0.071667 |  and jumping over the advertising hoardings.
[13105.10 - 13109.10] P:1780.82 E:0.075176 |  So I'm not sure that they are of a mind,
[13109.10 - 13113.10] P:1778.14 E:0.081291 |  those who are on the pitch, even though they are being moved back.
[13113.10 - 13117.10] P:1746.95 E:0.084310 |  So, I mean, the site is a massive crowd
[13117.10 - 13121.10] P:1902.53 E:0.078101 |  that has been forced further and further back
[13121.10 - 13124.10] P:1788.32 E:0.100251 |  towards the face of the stand there.
[13124.10 - 13127.10] P:1597.76 E:0.097131 |  And I think some people now have realised
[13127.10 - 13129.10] P:1780.39 E:0.088293 |  that they do have to turn tail
[13129.10 - 13132.10] P:1678.88 E:0.082383 |  to actually get back over the hoardings
[13132.10 - 13134.10] P:1654.97 E:0.077659 |  and take their places in the stand again.
[13134.10 - 13136.10] P:1874.42 E:0.091989 |  There's somebody hanging off the crossbar.
[13136.10 - 13138.10] P:1875.19 E:0.087095 |  There's somebody standing on the crossbar now.
[13138.10 - 13141.10] P:1698.10 E:0.081952 |  I do just worry for the fans in and around that goal net
[13141.10 - 13144.10] P:1762.22 E:0.078340 |  because the posts will probably come down at this rate.
[13144.10 - 13146.10] P:1840.62 E:0.076564 |  And there's also, everyone's kind of...
[13146.10 - 13149.10] P:1776.08 E:0.086787 |  There's a few people tangled up in that net as well.
[13149.10 - 13152.10] P:1765.87 E:0.069668 |  And the person who's on top of the crossbar has just tried to get down
[13152.10 - 13155.10] P:1787.82 E:0.095478 |  and sort of fallen down into the arms of a group of supporters.
[13155.10 - 13158.10] P:1940.89 E:0.089154 |  But yeah, there are still now PSG fans who are
[13158.10 - 13161.10] P:1848.44 E:0.077314 |  just kind of climbing. The hoarding's actually quite high there.
[13161.10 - 13164.10] P:1775.78 E:0.084118 |  They're sort of having to step up and then reach over the top
[13164.10 - 13165.10] P:1905.43 E:0.086189 |  to get out of the way.
[13165.10 - 13168.10] P:1955.78 E:0.082253 |  And I would say that the line of stewards and line of police
[13168.10 - 13171.10] P:1730.89 E:0.071747 |  is not moving particularly quickly.
[13171.10 - 13174.10] P:1889.21 E:0.081354 |  So, hopefully they're allowing enough time for those fans
[13174.10 - 13176.10] P:1852.69 E:0.079069 |  just to hop back over.
[13176.10 - 13179.10] P:1739.35 E:0.079798 |  But again, there's a fan climbing on top of the crossbar
[13179.10 - 13181.10] P:1734.88 E:0.079708 |  and those posts, I think, are coming down, John.
[13181.10 - 13184.10] P:1841.66 E:0.060845 |  Yeah, they are. And as you say,
[13184.10 - 13187.10] P:1875.85 E:0.087106 |  it does appear that people are caught up in the net
[13187.10 - 13189.10] P:1877.82 E:0.069367 |  in the goal there.
[13189.10 - 13192.10] P:1876.81 E:0.069729 |  And, you know, let's make it clear
[13192.10 - 13197.10] P:1801.51 E:0.074436 |  that these are still scenes of celebration.
[13197.10 - 13202.10] P:1731.41 E:0.082041 |  And, you know, we don't see any sign of anyone taking hurt down there,
[13202.10 - 13205.10] P:1829.99 E:0.080338 |  but there are people still very tightly packed in
[13205.10 - 13207.10] P:1713.78 E:0.094124 |  into a smaller and smaller area,
[13207.10 - 13212.10] P:1813.84 E:0.076464 |  as the police do in that long, thick black line
[13212.10 - 13214.10] P:1818.99 E:0.058795 |  force them back.
[13214.10 - 13216.10] P:1684.17 E:0.090867 |  And the hoarding's there. The advertising hoarding's
[13216.10 - 13219.10] P:1701.27 E:0.083669 |  for the Champions League are particularly high.
[13219.10 - 13222.10] P:1731.14 E:0.083379 |  Yeah. So they do, you know, it's an effort to get over that
[13222.10 - 13224.10] P:1743.71 E:0.086710 |  in a restricted area.
[13224.10 - 13228.10] P:1809.23 E:0.081406 |  And someone else has now climbed themselves up onto the
[13228.10 - 13231.10] P:1737.46 E:0.067518 |  crossbar of the goal,
[13231.10 - 13234.10] P:1855.45 E:0.084578 |  which is still just, we can see approximately
[13234.10 - 13237.10] P:1820.17 E:0.072907 |  what the top third of the posts and the crossbar
[13237.10 - 13239.10] P:1658.61 E:0.086122 |  and the netting underneath it.
[13239.10 - 13244.10] P:1843.86 E:0.081923 |  And little by little, I think the people are being forced back
[13244.10 - 13248.10] P:1776.35 E:0.074158 |  eventually off the pitch now and back into the stands.
[13248.10 - 13250.10] P:1495.95 E:0.082195 |  And let's just hope everyone's OK, Dan.
[13250.10 - 13254.10] P:1714.75 E:0.073563 |  Yeah, absolutely. And as you say, it's not great
[13254.10 - 13256.10] P:1663.23 E:0.093081 |  that people come onto the pitch clearly,
[13256.10 - 13259.10] P:1696.73 E:0.077479 |  but it's not really a discussion about behaviour at the minute.
[13259.10 - 13261.10] P:1823.93 E:0.078374 |  It's a discussion about safety,
[13261.10 - 13263.10] P:1754.16 E:0.083282 |  just to make sure everybody gets off safety.
[13263.10 - 13266.10] P:1755.62 E:0.078759 |  I can see that there's a sort of a big red line
[13266.10 - 13270.10] P:1784.71 E:0.074662 |  that is being held by the stewards right at the front.
[13270.10 - 13272.10] P:1856.66 E:0.083492 |  So there's a line of sort of armed riot police
[13272.10 - 13274.10] P:1902.65 E:0.090354 |  who haven't been really getting involved
[13274.10 - 13277.10] P:1894.80 E:0.079176 |  beyond the fact that they are in a long line.
[13277.10 - 13280.10] P:1949.25 E:0.086445 |  We haven't seen anybody, you know, using any of the gear
[13280.10 - 13281.10] P:1702.72 E:0.077371 |  that they have with them there.
[13281.10 - 13284.10] P:1880.55 E:0.076041 |  Then there's a line of pink-shirted stewards in front of them.
[13284.10 - 13287.10] P:2079.48 E:0.091087 |  And then stewards in yellow bibs who are just sort of holding up
[13287.10 - 13291.10] P:1658.59 E:0.068887 |  a big red ticker tape, which some fans are walking underneath.
[13291.10 - 13294.10] P:1835.25 E:0.075520 |  And now that sort of line is getting thinner and thinner
[13294.10 - 13296.10] P:1813.26 E:0.070049 |  and fingers crossed, John.
[13296.10 - 13301.10] P:1808.31 E:0.068248 |  It looks like most of the fans now are either off the pitch
[13301.10 - 13303.10] P:1907.63 E:0.062555 |  or shortly will be off the pitch.
[13303.10 - 13307.10] P:1747.19 E:0.079016 |  Yeah, I think probably by the nature of what's happened there
[13307.10 - 13311.10] P:1816.03 E:0.068820 |  and the effort involved to get out of the stands
[13311.10 - 13315.10] P:1831.79 E:0.061857 |  over the Hordings and onto the pitch,
[13315.10 - 13318.10] P:1701.12 E:0.094352 |  you know, you have to be relatively agile to do that.
[13318.10 - 13320.10] P:1774.35 E:0.052092 |  So...
[13320.10 - 13324.10] P:1752.14 E:0.089087 |  And there are no signs of anyone needing assistance
[13324.10 - 13328.10] P:1627.93 E:0.092408 |  that I can see from where we sit here.
[13328.10 - 13331.10] P:1750.01 E:0.092732 |  And now we can actually see the goal has been cleared now
[13331.10 - 13333.10] P:1739.94 E:0.079206 |  and is still standing.
[13333.10 - 13336.10] P:1723.49 E:0.100129 |  And the net is hanging down there now clearly.
[13336.10 - 13339.10] P:1779.63 E:0.088140 |  And we can see the base of both posts.
[13339.10 - 13344.10] P:1858.14 E:0.090863 |  So this security operation does appear to have been successful
[13344.10 - 13347.10] P:1785.81 E:0.079261 |  in moving everyone first off the pitch
[13347.10 - 13349.10] P:1659.31 E:0.063576 |  and then back into the stands.
[13349.10 - 13351.10] P:1783.77 E:0.083765 |  Yeah, and I think it's probably a little telling
[13351.10 - 13354.10] P:1782.72 E:0.087187 |  that you may just have heard some Paris Saint-Germain fans chanting again
[13354.10 - 13356.10] P:1846.69 E:0.088204 |  because it all went a little bit quiet
[13356.10 - 13360.10] P:1682.55 E:0.073555 |  and they're trying to work out how to get people back off the pitch.
[13360.10 - 13363.10] P:1698.58 E:0.068882 |  So the line which was... I mean, there must have been
[13363.10 - 13366.10] P:1733.47 E:0.077447 |  500, 400, 500 on the pitch?
[13366.10 - 13368.10] P:1639.61 E:0.086415 |  Yeah, they're about...
[13368.10 - 13371.10] P:1658.08 E:0.067794 |  At one point and now we're probably, you know, 150, 200.
[13371.10 - 13373.10] P:1782.75 E:0.092225 |  So most of the work has been done.
[13373.10 - 13375.10] P:1889.22 E:0.081149 |  But as you say, the problem was, you know,
[13375.10 - 13377.10] P:1898.77 E:0.060036 |  if you're a fan who's decided you want to get onto the pitch,
[13377.10 - 13380.10] P:1796.49 E:0.084618 |  it's relatively easy to hop over a Hording.
[13380.10 - 13383.10] P:1826.13 E:0.084237 |  But to get back over it, just as an example, you know,
[13383.10 - 13385.10] P:1700.86 E:0.078375 |  we're watching fans do it right now.
[13385.10 - 13390.10] P:1861.61 E:0.089885 |  And we're still with you,
[13390.10 - 13392.10] P:1808.36 E:0.079347 |  but the fans are out.
[13392.10 - 13395.10] P:1886.18 E:0.096004 |  And so I think you can get a few hands on the barrier
[13395.10 - 13398.10] P:1771.45 E:0.075506 |  and really, really heave themselves to get over the top,
[13398.10 - 13401.10] P:1781.02 E:0.081165 |  which obviously when you've got a lot of fans behind you,
[13401.10 - 13403.10] P:1901.54 E:0.081455 |  can become quite a sticky situation.
[13403.10 - 13405.10] P:1811.09 E:0.091506 |  And that's another PA announcement,
[13405.10 - 13408.10] P:1763.03 E:0.076763 |  which I suspect is just underlying what's already been said.
[13408.10 - 13410.10] P:1507.48 E:0.079674 |  What it has done, John,
[13410.10 - 13413.10] P:1827.37 E:0.087455 |  has brought a really early end to the celebrations.
[13413.10 - 13416.90] P:1759.39 E:0.089304 |  the players. They're going to
[13416.90 - 13418.70] P:1694.89 E:0.093596 |  keep their eyes on the left
[13418.70 - 13420.90] P:1649.59 E:0.092061 |  hand side, but it does look like
[13420.90 - 13422.90] P:1801.82 E:0.080755 |  it's almost totally cleared now
[13422.90 - 13424.90] P:1752.73 E:0.072884 |  fingers crossed and just switch
[13424.90 - 13426.90] P:1303.04 E:0.076174 |  it back to the football. I think
[13426.90 - 13428.90] P:1729.92 E:0.086591 |  then Chris Sutton and the
[13428.90 - 13430.90] P:1830.56 E:0.080010 |  question I was going to ask I
[13430.90 - 13432.90] P:1759.67 E:0.073755 |  think before all of this
[13432.90 - 13434.90] P:1746.95 E:0.090260 |  happened is good to see you look
[13434.90 - 13436.90] P:1835.14 E:0.071622 |  at this Paris Saint-Germain team
[13436.90 - 13438.90] P:1790.09 E:0.093658 |  now. I think that's a good
[13438.90 - 13440.90] P:1711.52 E:0.062601 |  thing. I think that's a good
[13440.90 - 13442.90] P:1756.72 E:0.075996 |  thing. I think that's a good
[13443.10 - 13445.10] P:1456.81 E:0.064486 |  thing. I think it's important
[13445.10 - 13449.10] P:1655.95 E:0.090191 |  to know what is possible for
[13449.10 - 13451.10] P:1645.64 E:0.067982 |  them. They're so young. Yep,
[13451.10 - 13456.60] P:1708.18 E:0.078526 |  The age profile in the team
[13456.60 - 13459.20] P:1805.23 E:0.090025 |  mentioned. Do a craft's
[13459.20 - 13463.30] P:1832.91 E:0.081981 |  come back earlier wise is getting
[13463.30 - 13465.30] P:1666.49 E:0.096078 |  on a little bit, but still sort
[13465.30 - 13467.30] P:1639.94 E:0.085380 |  of in his prime. hydro 23
[13467.30 - 13468.90] P:1777.97 E:0.083885 |  taking me. You know, he feels
[13468.90 - 13471.70] P:1748.78 E:0.078066 |  like he's been around forever.
[13471.70 - 13474.74] P:1680.22 E:0.087548 |  It's where they go from here, really.
[13474.74 - 13478.46] P:1718.34 E:0.088780 |  But you think with Lewis Enrique at the helm,
[13478.46 - 13483.26] P:1881.58 E:0.087080 |  this is a team who are just at the start of their evolution, really.
[13483.26 - 13488.18] P:1771.59 E:0.081270 |  The most impressive thing in all for me with this PSG team
[13488.18 - 13490.38] P:1515.05 E:0.090487 |  is their work ethic. They're brilliant on the ball.
[13490.38 - 13493.98] P:1684.30 E:0.078376 |  They have great technicians in the team, but this is a team.
[13493.98 - 13496.18] P:1601.18 E:0.085196 |  The difference is, under Lewis Enrique,
[13496.18 - 13498.58] P:1528.54 E:0.081756 |  this is a team who are prepared to run,
[13498.58 - 13500.66] P:1656.41 E:0.080490 |  who are prepared to do the hard yards.
[13500.66 - 13504.10] P:1696.77 E:0.089160 |  They put the graft in, and that's why they were a success tonight,
[13504.10 - 13505.94] P:1526.56 E:0.077995 |  because they never let Inter play.
[13505.94 - 13509.82] P:1526.73 E:0.092582 |  Inter, there wasn't any moment in the game where Inter had control
[13509.82 - 13511.50] P:1339.79 E:0.088188 |  or got a foothold.
[13511.50 - 13514.50] P:1653.70 E:0.076658 |  And we spoke about Inter's experience,
[13514.50 - 13518.22] P:1775.95 E:0.075854 |  and they're now, and talked about them being street-wise.
[13518.22 - 13520.22] P:1676.20 E:0.067524 |  Tonight, they looked anything but.
[13520.22 - 13525.78] P:1808.28 E:0.078409 |  I think, John, in commentary, did you say that Duwe was the third teenager
[13525.78 - 13528.74] P:1683.55 E:0.085571 |  to score in the European Cup?
[13528.74 - 13530.74] P:1778.17 E:0.090576 |  He actually said Champions League final.
[13530.74 - 13534.74] P:1882.62 E:0.078567 |  OK, so before tonight, we had two teenagers who'd scored
[13534.74 - 13536.42] P:1763.11 E:0.073449 |  in the final of the Champions League.
[13536.42 - 13539.66] P:1825.90 E:0.084179 |  We've doubled that number in one evening with PSG,
[13539.66 - 13541.10] P:1897.36 E:0.095806 |  because more than half of their goals,
[13541.10 - 13544.34] P:1788.72 E:0.077058 |  Maillou and two from Duwe, came from teenagers.
[13544.34 - 13547.66] P:1713.86 E:0.071427 |  I mean, to the rest of Europe, that's pretty ominous.
[13547.66 - 13549.94] P:1610.14 E:0.083579 |  Yeah, and that is it.
[13549.94 - 13555.82] P:1701.05 E:0.072600 |  I suppose the thing is, PSG have got the riches to keep these players,
[13555.90 - 13556.90] P:1466.27 E:0.085638 |  haven't they?
[13556.90 - 13560.10] P:1715.20 E:0.076564 |  And you just had to witness what we saw tonight
[13560.10 - 13563.18] P:1812.01 E:0.080377 |  to know that this looks like a happy place to be.
[13563.18 - 13566.30] P:1592.15 E:0.071904 |  And it's appeared that way all season.
[13566.30 - 13570.18] P:1625.39 E:0.078516 |  And you've heard us how many times we've been there this season,
[13570.18 - 13575.18] P:1571.33 E:0.069940 |  and have said the part de France is the place to be.
[13575.18 - 13578.10] P:1689.27 E:0.078772 |  And that's one of the best places to go and watch football.
[13578.10 - 13580.58] P:1739.84 E:0.086161 |  So therefore, it would follow that if you're doing things like
[13580.58 - 13581.90] P:1705.99 E:0.071353 |  winning the Champions League,
[13581.90 - 13584.62] P:1719.68 E:0.079688 |  it's one of the best places to play football as well.
[13584.62 - 13588.70] P:1867.79 E:0.093832 |  You know, everybody talks about the Premier League being the best league in the world.
[13588.70 - 13591.58] P:1598.31 E:0.078353 |  People can have a debate about that, you know, right or wrong,
[13591.58 - 13595.70] P:1742.23 E:0.076873 |  but you think about our best teams, Liverpool,
[13595.70 - 13600.06] P:1596.70 E:0.089708 |  and the way that Liverpool got away with one in the part de France,
[13600.06 - 13604.06] P:1740.82 E:0.084263 |  and yet they had the maturity PSG to go to Anfield and beat them.
[13604.06 - 13608.70] P:1770.68 E:0.084352 |  And look, it hasn't been an incredible Arsenal team this season,
[13608.70 - 13610.82] P:1615.14 E:0.088536 |  but they've still had enough about them, you think,
[13610.82 - 13613.70] P:1796.25 E:0.081328 |  that they could have taken PSG's scalp.
[13613.70 - 13615.38] P:1581.90 E:0.071983 |  That didn't happen.
[13615.38 - 13620.18] P:1627.91 E:0.084665 |  They are a brilliantly well-balanced team, and you're right, you know,
[13620.18 - 13625.34] P:1843.26 E:0.081955 |  when you feel as a player like you're at the start of something
[13625.34 - 13626.74] P:1671.01 E:0.075242 |  and you're building something,
[13626.74 - 13632.38] P:1766.94 E:0.064594 |  that's an incredible feeling for these PSG players,
[13632.38 - 13635.58] P:1714.76 E:0.073909 |  an incredible position for them to be in.
[13635.58 - 13638.42] P:1716.27 E:0.086026 |  And, you know, tonight they thoroughly deserved it,
[13638.42 - 13642.66] P:1701.29 E:0.061827 |  and it wasn't just winning, it was blowing into a way.
[13642.70 - 13644.66] P:1965.99 E:0.096605 |  It looks like now, just to our left-hand side,
[13644.66 - 13649.46] P:1693.04 E:0.076499 |  to confirm that all of the Paris Saint-Germain supporters
[13649.46 - 13652.34] P:1652.86 E:0.071768 |  that came onto the pitch are now off the pitch.
[13652.34 - 13657.06] P:1769.21 E:0.082354 |  I can see one more bare-chested fan who's actually standing on that hoarding
[13657.06 - 13660.42] P:1643.09 E:0.072089 |  that way we're discussing that the fans had to climb over
[13660.42 - 13662.58] P:1722.21 E:0.068832 |  to get back off the pitch.
[13662.58 - 13665.22] P:1806.40 E:0.077493 |  I have to say, John, I think as a sort of...
[13665.22 - 13667.50] P:1737.78 E:0.079651 |  I don't know, the right word is an operation.
[13667.50 - 13671.22] P:1715.43 E:0.077267 |  In that circumstances, it looks from what we can see
[13671.26 - 13674.10] P:1604.11 E:0.083423 |  that that was handled very well and everyone has been able to get off OK.
[13674.10 - 13677.06] P:1657.70 E:0.082893 |  Yeah, I think helped by the fact that there wasn't any,
[13677.06 - 13679.34] P:1345.44 E:0.078913 |  for one of the better word, agro in there.
[13679.34 - 13680.90] P:1591.05 E:0.080021 |  They were all happy people,
[13680.90 - 13684.54] P:1668.01 E:0.091539 |  and they were trying to get closer to the scenes of celebration.
[13684.54 - 13689.62] P:1601.74 E:0.081258 |  And yes, the security forces did not weigh in.
[13689.62 - 13695.54] P:1554.42 E:0.090879 |  As you said, they stood back and allowed people enough space to...
[13695.54 - 13698.14] P:1545.67 E:0.088654 |  Although, you know, that was uncomfortable briefly.
[13698.14 - 13700.18] P:1725.53 E:0.066329 |  Yeah, it was. Yeah, absolutely.
[13700.18 - 13702.74] P:1801.04 E:0.091719 |  Right, just before we go, then we've got a couple of minutes.
[13702.74 - 13704.66] P:1834.05 E:0.084957 |  Stephen Nolan is on the way shortly.
[13704.66 - 13706.90] P:1904.20 E:0.095277 |  Final thoughts from you both around Lewis Enrique.
[13706.90 - 13707.82] P:1796.69 E:0.086615 |  Let me do the start.
[13707.82 - 13710.58] P:1812.41 E:0.079158 |  The sixth manager to win the Champions League with two different clubs,
[13710.58 - 13712.82] P:1784.33 E:0.084006 |  Carlo Ancelotti, Ockmar Hitzfeldt,
[13712.82 - 13716.94] P:1767.45 E:0.078885 |  Joppe Hainke's Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola.
[13716.94 - 13719.74] P:1762.26 E:0.091454 |  And Pep Guardiola is the man, of course, that he's so influenced by
[13719.74 - 13721.62] P:1788.05 E:0.043787 |  and so compared to.
[13721.62 - 13727.10] P:1736.38 E:0.081126 |  Do we have to now say that Lewis Enrique is amongst the best coaches
[13727.10 - 13728.14] P:2048.19 E:0.095371 |  of his generation?
[13728.18 - 13730.26] P:1703.05 E:0.066528 |  That's probably the least we have to say, isn't it?
[13730.26 - 13733.70] P:1785.92 E:0.091783 |  Yeah, I think so in the way that he sets his team up,
[13733.70 - 13736.86] P:1827.77 E:0.080764 |  you know, in his work ethic,
[13736.86 - 13741.18] P:1868.04 E:0.089803 |  and the way that he has built this PSG team.
[13741.18 - 13745.66] P:1729.59 E:0.076855 |  And, you know, we speak about the money which they have spent
[13745.66 - 13750.06] P:1873.08 E:0.078051 |  and, you know, what their reign was while spending the money.
[13750.06 - 13753.34] P:1707.31 E:0.084050 |  And they've taken a hell of a long time to get where they want to be.
[13753.34 - 13756.74] P:1815.65 E:0.080505 |  But Lewis Enrique is the guy
[13756.74 - 13759.70] P:1764.60 E:0.081976 |  that maybe the final piece in the jigsaw, if you like,
[13759.70 - 13761.42] P:1914.40 E:0.077677 |  to actually get them there.
[13761.42 - 13764.22] P:1797.10 E:0.083022 |  Now it's about, you know, they are the team to beat.
[13764.22 - 13765.62] P:1890.88 E:0.075539 |  Can they maintain it?
[13765.62 - 13769.06] P:1734.12 E:0.083844 |  In terms of, yeah, top European managers of all time,
[13769.06 - 13773.18] P:1660.04 E:0.072921 |  then he has to be in that category.
[13773.18 - 13776.30] P:1573.43 E:0.098916 |  And I think just a thought on what has been a new look
[13776.30 - 13779.14] P:1540.90 E:0.079941 |  Champions League this season, which, as you both know,
[13779.14 - 13781.34] P:1548.05 E:0.081312 |  I'm still not absolutely sold on.
[13781.34 - 13785.26] P:1631.86 E:0.086101 |  You know, I'm not sure it's as fair as it should be,
[13785.26 - 13787.10] P:1791.92 E:0.079499 |  certainly in the league phase.
[13787.10 - 13789.98] P:1650.82 E:0.086189 |  Knockout stage is probably as good as it's ever been,
[13789.98 - 13791.50] P:1249.47 E:0.056061 |  because that's...
[13791.50 - 13793.38] P:1537.04 E:0.074656 |  You can't mess with that.
[13793.38 - 13796.26] P:1558.31 E:0.081347 |  A two-legged knockout scenario.
[13796.26 - 13799.70] P:1608.57 E:0.084815 |  But, I mean, some of the memories that we've had from this Champions League,
[13799.70 - 13803.30] P:1589.57 E:0.093419 |  I'm thinking, Aston Villa-Chris, when we watched them beat Bayern Munich,
[13803.30 - 13804.86] P:1749.52 E:0.067259 |  that was an incredible night.
[13804.86 - 13808.30] P:1743.96 E:0.074421 |  Liverpool winning their first seven matches.
[13808.30 - 13814.58] P:1847.98 E:0.084849 |  Celtic finishing 21st and Manchester City 22nd in the table.
[13814.58 - 13817.62] P:1640.52 E:0.082338 |  I can't remember the group match Barcelona in Lisbon
[13817.62 - 13819.42] P:1599.57 E:0.085268 |  against Benfica on the wet night.
[13819.42 - 13821.14] P:1637.45 E:0.075612 |  That was an amazing game.
[13821.14 - 13825.02] P:1836.59 E:0.071039 |  I think the last night of it, the 36 team group,
[13825.02 - 13827.74] P:1795.70 E:0.067635 |  I'm still having nightmares about that.
[13827.74 - 13832.58] P:1686.33 E:0.087809 |  And Bates-Hattrick in the Burnabout against Manchester City,
[13832.58 - 13834.30] P:1490.04 E:0.084257 |  that was a memory.
[13834.30 - 13838.10] P:1587.21 E:0.082263 |  Liverpool, Taris-San, German, and what happened in that tie.
[13838.10 - 13841.10] P:1753.59 E:0.088783 |  Rice-Rice Baby, of course, we can't forget that.
[13841.14 - 13844.38] P:1816.17 E:0.094406 |  You had the Villa comeback, didn't you, against PSG?
[13844.38 - 13846.06] P:1609.44 E:0.086337 |  Villa's comeback? You think, blimey.
[13846.06 - 13847.42] P:1577.91 E:0.086413 |  Yeah, into Barça.
[13847.42 - 13849.42] P:1489.05 E:0.107000 |  One of the most amazing... Which one?
[13849.42 - 13850.82] P:1287.70 E:0.072681 |  Well, both of them.
[13850.82 - 13853.26] P:1537.98 E:0.098941 |  One of the most amazing ties that we've ever seen.
[13853.26 - 13857.82] P:1787.46 E:0.076180 |  But in the end, I strongly feel that we've seen the team of this season
[13857.82 - 13859.82] P:1568.35 E:0.095842 |  emerge in the way that they've done,
[13859.82 - 13861.82] P:1744.99 E:0.085142 |  and the way that they've done it,
[13861.82 - 13865.42] P:1784.96 E:0.074109 |  to record a record margin of victory for a European final.
[13865.42 - 13870.50] P:1855.03 E:0.083728 |  Only the third team to get five goals or more in a European Cup
[13870.70 - 13872.22] P:1746.30 E:0.078154 |  or Champions League final.
[13872.22 - 13875.18] P:1675.19 E:0.080036 |  And this is the 70th one of those.
[13875.18 - 13879.06] P:1883.40 E:0.083971 |  That banner before the match, in amongst the PSG supporters,
[13879.06 - 13882.62] P:1655.23 E:0.073399 |  said, together, we are invincible.
[13882.62 - 13884.82] P:1560.42 E:0.078751 |  Well, they've not been invincible.
[13884.82 - 13887.98] P:1742.08 E:0.077793 |  They've lost five matches in the Champions League this season,
[13887.98 - 13890.74] P:1592.69 E:0.069345 |  but they are the champions.
[13890.74 - 13893.14] P:1827.78 E:0.088810 |  There will be lots of complicated opinions
[13893.14 - 13894.62] P:1880.13 E:0.078557 |  about this new Champions League.
[13894.62 - 13898.10] P:1836.81 E:0.082752 |  There will be people who look at this and say, hang on a second.
[13898.14 - 13900.82] P:1840.89 E:0.084223 |  The team that finished 15th in the league phase
[13900.82 - 13902.70] P:1618.96 E:0.084824 |  have just won the European Cup.
[13902.70 - 13906.42] P:1910.70 E:0.088824 |  There will be lots more who say PSG were the best team
[13906.42 - 13911.46] P:1531.85 E:0.072772 |  in the European Cup this season, and they have won it.
[13911.46 - 13913.74] P:1599.78 E:0.072798 |  Chris John, thank you both very much indeed.
[13913.74 - 13916.26] P:1747.69 E:0.073616 |  Chris Sutton, correspondent John Murray.
[13916.26 - 13920.30] P:1784.96 E:0.086267 |  Ticker tape everywhere on the pitch here at the Allianz Arena.
[13920.30 - 13923.38] P:1807.16 E:0.079214 |  Paris Saint-Germain have won the European Cup
[13923.38 - 13926.14] P:1995.28 E:0.069025 |  for the first time in their history.
[13926.14 - 13929.82] P:1997.59 E:0.081058 |  Steven Nolan, up next on 5 Live after the news with Shojo Saka.
