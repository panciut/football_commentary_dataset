[0.00 - 4.44] P:1946.73 E:0.050385 |  Club legend, Petitci. Played for this club a long time ago.
[4.44 - 7.20] P:1938.43 E:0.104733 |  Petitci, actually, the nickname means Little Duck,
[7.20 - 10.28] P:1865.40 E:0.107578 |  and he was slight of frame, but he was a mighty player,
[10.28 - 12.56] P:1805.57 E:0.100761 |  scored lots of goals for Athletic Bill Bauer.
[12.56 - 15.64] P:1699.39 E:0.098571 |  It's Arsenal's first ever game, competitive game,
[15.64 - 17.32] P:1658.63 E:0.103617 |  against Athletic Bill Bauer,
[17.32 - 19.52] P:1676.97 E:0.114179 |  and that is one of the great traditions
[19.52 - 21.04] P:1683.56 E:0.114809 |  of this great football club,
[21.04 - 24.20] P:1712.61 E:0.107770 |  and now the atmosphere builds again ahead of kickoff,
[24.20 - 28.12] P:1556.27 E:0.113687 |  and Arsenal sort of try and seal themselves away from it a little bit.
[28.16 - 33.32] P:1613.95 E:0.103033 |  They're in a team huddle down, way down below us on that pitch,
[33.32 - 35.36] P:1536.09 E:0.107383 |  and they just break away from that.
[35.36 - 37.72] P:1705.55 E:0.100403 |  David Ryder gives Cala Fiori a big hug.
[37.72 - 41.16] P:1500.42 E:0.087058 |  The Arsenal fans just under 3,000 of them,
[41.16 - 44.56] P:1708.27 E:0.101256 |  up high away to our right-hand side through the Arsenal flags.
[44.56 - 48.76] P:1695.99 E:0.080585 |  You can see there at the front of their section behind the netting,
[48.76 - 51.56] P:1676.52 E:0.091426 |  and the game is about to get underway.
[51.56 - 54.84] P:1811.42 E:0.094082 |  Only two English clubs have ever won here in European competition.
[54.84 - 56.64] P:1793.73 E:0.094706 |  Manchester United did it last season,
[56.68 - 59.56] P:1920.22 E:0.086908 |  first leg of the Europa League semi-final.
[59.56 - 62.48] P:2006.74 E:0.097144 |  Liverpool did it at the Old Sandman Estadium.
[63.40 - 67.24] P:1983.57 E:0.105603 |  Back in 1983, 84, a certain Ian Rush
[67.24 - 69.92] P:2077.16 E:0.111040 |  scored the only goal of the game on route
[69.92 - 72.56] P:2124.72 E:0.108133 |  to winning the European Cup that season.
[72.56 - 75.28] P:2143.81 E:0.110065 |  That is what Arsenal are trying to do this season
[75.28 - 77.52] P:2006.19 E:0.110444 |  for the first time in their history,
[77.52 - 79.92] P:2049.09 E:0.116008 |  and their Champions League campaign gets underway.
[79.92 - 81.56] P:2001.82 E:0.099930 |  Rice plays it back to Ryder.
[81.56 - 84.32] P:1981.16 E:0.096559 |  Ryder goes long, Merino heads it forward,
[84.32 - 85.92] P:1911.17 E:0.092529 |  headed away by Danny Vivian,
[85.92 - 87.76] P:1799.56 E:0.097156 |  nodded down the line by Timber,
[87.76 - 90.68] P:1903.33 E:0.110475 |  and then hoofed away by Adama Boyro,
[90.68 - 94.16] P:1927.31 E:0.090194 |  who starts at left back for Athletic Bilbao.
[94.16 - 97.40] P:1809.57 E:0.109327 |  It is a really interesting team selection from the home team.
[97.40 - 99.12] P:1879.98 E:0.100892 |  Four changes, the ball has come in.
[99.12 - 101.52] P:1746.74 E:0.104686 |  It's their first start to the season for all of them.
[101.52 - 104.04] P:1758.13 E:0.101878 |  Big changes from the Atlético Bilbao manager.
[104.04 - 107.76] P:1778.92 E:0.096022 |  I think obviously they lost last time out at home against Alves
[107.76 - 110.28] P:1889.52 E:0.092574 |  to a surprise defeat to an own goal.
[110.28 - 112.44] P:1785.93 E:0.090545 |  They had a great start to the season, other than that,
[112.44 - 114.40] P:1774.10 E:0.103066 |  maybe that's something the coaches are thinking.
[114.40 - 117.28] P:1796.06 E:0.089525 |  They actually played a friendly game during the international break.
[117.28 - 119.16] P:1799.57 E:0.090443 |  The coach had the majority of their players.
[119.16 - 121.48] P:1757.54 E:0.095689 |  They had a friendly game behind closed doors,
[121.48 - 123.04] P:1690.33 E:0.110815 |  so you do wonder whether those selections
[123.04 - 124.52] P:1741.73 E:0.078299 |  have come from something like that.
[124.52 - 126.52] P:1734.91 E:0.106109 |  I'll remind you of the two-team line-ups
[126.52 - 129.16] P:1698.32 E:0.095648 |  and just the second when we get our first break in play,
[129.16 - 130.52] P:1769.30 E:0.102585 |  just under a minute in,
[130.52 - 131.84] P:1828.76 E:0.111603 |  Arsenal seeing lots of the ball.
[131.84 - 134.84] P:1908.02 E:0.102896 |  Gabrielle is the captain, William Saliva,
[134.84 - 136.76] P:1909.26 E:0.101386 |  on his way back to fitness on the bench,
[136.76 - 138.76] P:1839.64 E:0.092271 |  but Christian Mosquera,
[138.76 - 141.60] P:1648.32 E:0.101944 |  the 21-year-old Spaniard signed from Valencia.
[141.60 - 144.00] P:1810.68 E:0.103536 |  He's done really well since coming into the Arsenal team,
[144.00 - 147.76] P:1986.74 E:0.113993 |  pressing to emergency action at Anfield when Saliva went down.
[147.76 - 150.56] P:2081.20 E:0.111838 |  They've really well against Nottingham Forest at the weekend.
[150.56 - 153.28] P:2062.97 E:0.118663 |  Gears and whistles for Ryder on the ball for Arsenal.
[153.28 - 155.28] P:2049.48 E:0.097635 |  It comes into midfield.
[155.28 - 157.92] P:2019.21 E:0.111504 |  He's played back by Zubemendi to the goalkeeper again.
[157.92 - 159.64] P:2000.77 E:0.091686 |  Now out to Gabrielle,
[159.64 - 162.88] P:2054.67 E:0.107331 |  an athletic Bilbao in the red and white vertical strikes.
[162.88 - 165.64] P:2087.70 E:0.104815 |  Red panels on their backs with white numbers on those,
[165.64 - 167.68] P:2017.92 E:0.105717 |  black shorts and black socks.
[167.68 - 168.68] P:1992.02 E:0.116850 |  Paul.
[168.68 - 170.68] P:2018.59 E:0.120494 |  Another interesting change from the manager.
[170.68 - 172.68] P:2021.07 E:0.118322 |  We spoke about the formation before and who made it a threat,
[172.72 - 175.72] P:2009.14 E:0.112964 |  in a very, very orthodox 4-4-2 formation.
[175.72 - 178.72] P:1886.57 E:0.112972 |  Inaki Williams, the captain, he's up front alongside Santhert.
[178.72 - 181.48] P:1836.65 E:0.109783 |  Berenge, who we thought might be deployed down the centre,
[181.48 - 183.48] P:1752.73 E:0.107648 |  he's actually playing on the right-hand side.
[183.48 - 185.48] P:1796.49 E:0.120377 |  They're quite happy here at the moment without the ball,
[185.48 - 189.00] P:1953.21 E:0.107183 |  a quite sacrificial in possession, allowing Arsenal to dominate the possession,
[189.00 - 191.48] P:1894.69 E:0.113575 |  as you can probably tell by the noises in the background.
[191.48 - 193.48] P:1855.46 E:0.105837 |  Zubemendi plays to Timber.
[193.48 - 196.48] P:1917.04 E:0.105169 |  Timber dummy to pass up the touch line, nearly lost the ball there.
[196.48 - 199.08] P:1770.43 E:0.095486 |  Mosquera gives it a good thump, crossed the halfway line.
[199.08 - 201.08] P:1880.81 E:0.095063 |  It bounces on the halfway line,
[201.48 - 203.08] P:1667.59 E:0.106130 |  hoisted forward into the Arsenal half.
[203.08 - 205.08] P:1705.25 E:0.098016 |  Zubemendi comes forward to win the header.
[205.08 - 207.08] P:1784.57 E:0.099991 |  Eza nods it back into his own half.
[207.08 - 209.08] P:1818.60 E:0.100909 |  Got a shove in the back, no free kick.
[209.08 - 211.08] P:1761.86 E:0.099492 |  The referee's going to let that go.
[211.08 - 213.08] P:1665.57 E:0.095250 |  The ball is back with David Reier.
[213.08 - 215.08] P:1675.60 E:0.102413 |  So, Eza making a Champions League debut,
[215.08 - 217.08] P:1749.30 E:0.097878 |  so is Mosquera at the back for Arsenal.
[217.08 - 221.08] P:1667.27 E:0.103625 |  And Noni Medwayke played in Champions League qualifying rounds
[221.08 - 223.08] P:1682.25 E:0.101658 |  for PSV Eindhoven.
[223.08 - 226.08] P:1547.44 E:0.088023 |  This is his first appearance in the competition proper.
[226.08 - 229.08] P:1707.52 E:0.085335 |  Timber plays back to Mosquera.
[229.08 - 233.08] P:1827.83 E:0.093546 |  Mosquera across to Gabrielle, just outside the Arsenal penalty area.
[233.08 - 238.08] P:1858.92 E:0.098277 |  The pitch pretty much entirely draped in shade.
[238.08 - 240.08] P:1912.77 E:0.110833 |  A few splashes of sunshine down there.
[241.08 - 245.08] P:1835.35 E:0.114772 |  Just coming up to 7 o'clock local time in the evening in northern Spain.
[245.08 - 247.08] P:1704.52 E:0.106537 |  As Gabrielle goes long, looking for Yurkarez,
[247.08 - 249.08] P:1759.11 E:0.089647 |  beaten in the air by Perades.
[249.08 - 251.08] P:1712.04 E:0.097562 |  Yurkarez battles again.
[251.08 - 253.08] P:1848.35 E:0.097889 |  The ball bounces in the centre circle.
[253.08 - 256.08] P:1833.59 E:0.089317 |  Perades nips in, lost the ball up in the air.
[256.08 - 258.08] P:1907.43 E:0.085075 |  It's brought down here by Timber.
[258.08 - 260.08] P:1780.45 E:0.112410 |  He goes to Medwayke on the right-hand side,
[260.08 - 263.08] P:1788.43 E:0.108588 |  and immediately those Redmond White shirts are back so quickly
[263.08 - 267.08] P:1736.37 E:0.101575 |  and surrounding Arsenal when they get into possession in attacking positions.
[267.08 - 270.08] P:1772.49 E:0.111305 |  They had the best defensive record in the league last season.
[270.08 - 273.08] P:1876.19 E:0.113287 |  Obviously took them to the semi-final of the Europa League here
[273.08 - 275.08] P:1793.78 E:0.109093 |  where they lost 3-0 to Manchester United,
[275.08 - 277.08] P:1697.55 E:0.096825 |  but they went down to 10 men.
[277.08 - 279.08] P:1648.88 E:0.104177 |  Obviously Vivian and Perades, the two centre halves,
[279.08 - 282.08] P:1803.87 E:0.099576 |  they form a great partnership and they're very defensively organised.
[282.08 - 285.08] P:1812.28 E:0.100770 |  Valverde works very hard on the training ground with them out of possession.
[285.08 - 288.08] P:1805.37 E:0.097603 |  Gabrielle's ball forward, intercepted by Perades.
[288.08 - 290.08] P:1869.03 E:0.106084 |  He plays it through the middle of the pitch here.
[290.08 - 292.08] P:1828.75 E:0.111027 |  Possibly a chance to hit a shot from Reigns.
[292.08 - 294.08] P:1909.81 E:0.116041 |  They still keep coming in.
[294.08 - 296.08] P:1961.94 E:0.116478 |  Califuri gets a foot in.
[296.08 - 298.08] P:1955.22 E:0.109303 |  Before David Rye was about to be tested,
[298.08 - 303.08] P:1822.29 E:0.101578 |  home fans love the early attacking initiative from Athletic Bill Bauer.
[303.08 - 306.08] P:2011.12 E:0.114107 |  Push on Timber, free kick for Arsenal in the middle of their own half.
[306.08 - 310.08] P:2104.06 E:0.093806 |  So coming up to four minutes played in the Champions League,
[310.08 - 314.08] P:1816.34 E:0.089947 |  first round of fixtures in this league phase this season.
[314.08 - 317.08] P:1875.20 E:0.099886 |  Athletic Bill Bauer, Arsenal, Neil Paul Robinson.
[317.08 - 320.08] P:1864.85 E:0.091936 |  We talk about the tough test for Arsenal coming here tonight.
[320.08 - 322.08] P:1796.65 E:0.097895 |  People say they come out of pot four,
[322.08 - 324.08] P:1807.34 E:0.097669 |  but when you look at their record last year
[324.08 - 327.08] P:1874.04 E:0.094289 |  and when they got to the semi-final of the Europa League,
[327.08 - 330.08] P:1816.97 E:0.093976 |  they finished fourth behind Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.
[330.08 - 332.08] P:1941.20 E:0.090311 |  70 points in the league last season,
[332.08 - 335.08] P:1827.14 E:0.092888 |  whilst at the same time having the best defensive record.
[335.08 - 337.08] P:1832.32 E:0.097319 |  This is a tough test for Arsenal tonight.
[337.08 - 339.08] P:1890.27 E:0.095616 |  If they get through this, it'll be a big statement.
[339.08 - 342.08] P:1905.96 E:0.093339 |  Incredibly experienced manager as well.
[342.08 - 345.08] P:2009.04 E:0.100090 |  Ernesto Valverde, a third-spelling charge of the club,
[345.08 - 348.08] P:2056.79 E:0.098285 |  has managed more games in charge of Athletic Bill Bauer
[348.08 - 353.08] P:1994.60 E:0.096317 |  than any other, 457, and counting this evening.
[353.08 - 355.08] P:1991.81 E:0.108836 |  Former Barcelona boss who famously was in charge
[355.08 - 358.08] P:1943.91 E:0.102777 |  when Barcelona lost that Champions League semi-final
[358.08 - 362.08] P:1942.22 E:0.095769 |  second leg at Amfield against Liverpool by four goals to Neil.
[362.08 - 364.08] P:1780.68 E:0.104304 |  This is Athletic Bill Bauer, Neil Arsenal,
[364.08 - 366.08] P:1853.04 E:0.089813 |  five live and BBC sounds.
[366.08 - 369.08] P:1785.88 E:0.092556 |  Tottenham Villareal commentary from eight o'clock this evening.
[369.08 - 371.08] P:1882.45 E:0.106478 |  We'll keep you across all the goals as they go in.
[371.08 - 375.08] P:1834.87 E:0.089350 |  League Cup commentaries on the Sports Extra Networks as well.
[375.08 - 377.08] P:1884.08 E:0.088699 |  And Arsenal just playing some patient keep ball
[377.08 - 379.08] P:1718.10 E:0.097800 |  inside the Athletic Bill Bauer half.
[379.08 - 381.08] P:1891.72 E:0.100470 |  Pass from Madelueva, he doesn't quite find Timber.
[381.08 - 384.08] P:1838.21 E:0.104110 |  Interception from Boiro, goes out for an Arsenal throw.
[384.08 - 387.08] P:1817.45 E:0.091812 |  Timber takes that quickly down the line to Yurkares.
[387.08 - 389.08] P:1892.53 E:0.096456 |  He holds it up, can't find Marino.
[389.08 - 391.08] P:1815.64 E:0.086631 |  Supermendi's there to intercept the ball forward,
[391.08 - 393.08] P:1803.79 E:0.095527 |  then Marino plays a pass back into his own half
[393.08 - 395.08] P:1817.89 E:0.105823 |  and finds Gabrielle and Arsenal quickly
[395.08 - 397.08] P:1730.93 E:0.095697 |  ship it out to the left-hand side.
[397.08 - 399.08] P:1778.58 E:0.109278 |  Here's Calafiori, the pass is beyond.
[399.08 - 402.08] P:1938.80 E:0.104604 |  There's a little run-out for a throw-in to Athletic Bill Bauer.
[402.08 - 405.08] P:1873.46 E:0.106244 |  I'm not sure that Arsenal expected to have this much early possession.
[405.08 - 407.08] P:1856.82 E:0.098173 |  From the start, we're coming up to the six minute of the game,
[407.08 - 410.08] P:1743.06 E:0.103577 |  but they've had the majority of the ball rotating possession,
[410.08 - 412.08] P:1841.94 E:0.094390 |  keeping the ball, I think with the atmosphere
[412.08 - 414.08] P:1773.39 E:0.103426 |  and the way that Athletic Club do normally start games,
[414.08 - 416.08] P:1754.69 E:0.083946 |  they expected to be pressed, pressed high.
[416.08 - 419.08] P:1758.46 E:0.097964 |  Athletic Club had one attempt coming down the right-hand side,
[419.08 - 422.08] P:1753.59 E:0.091326 |  but actually Arsenal have controlled the tempo of the game.
[422.08 - 425.08] P:1765.89 E:0.086962 |  Six minutes in, 0-0, long ball downfield,
[425.08 - 428.08] P:1736.34 E:0.098589 |  headed forward by Moschera, Rice can't quite control it.
[428.08 - 432.08] P:1794.43 E:0.089753 |  Comes off his right boot and goes out for a throw-in to Athletic Bill Bauer.
[432.08 - 436.08] P:1803.70 E:0.087563 |  The offside flag was up, so it's actually going to be a free kick to the home team.
[436.08 - 441.08] P:1719.73 E:0.098485 |  Don't forget, Champions League highlights back on the BBC as well this season.
[441.08 - 446.08] P:1766.04 E:0.089412 |  So 10-40 tomorrow on BBC One, then Mark Chapman has Jimmy Floyd,
[446.08 - 449.08] P:1860.57 E:0.094179 |  Hasselbank and Julianne LeRan as his guests,
[449.08 - 453.08] P:1786.91 E:0.086223 |  and BBC Two on Thursday at 11 o'clock,
[453.08 - 455.08] P:1858.10 E:0.086211 |  Gabby Logan will host the show,
[455.08 - 459.08] P:1735.69 E:0.093776 |  Newcastle Barcelona, Manchester City, Napoli amongst the highlights.
[459.08 - 462.08] P:1767.31 E:0.091048 |  We've got commentary tomorrow night on Five Live,
[462.08 - 464.08] P:1840.94 E:0.079774 |  a bi-amunic against Chelsea,
[464.08 - 469.08] P:1736.10 E:0.096351 |  and Thursday night, Newcastle, Barcelona with Manchester City, Napoli on SportSex.
[469.08 - 472.08] P:1864.06 E:0.110518 |  Arsenal with defending to do, the ball breaks here to Hauregifre,
[472.08 - 475.08] P:1845.46 E:0.113899 |  chips it into the area, back across goal,
[475.08 - 477.08] P:1794.03 E:0.101219 |  really important in deception from Gabrielle.
[477.08 - 480.08] P:1858.99 E:0.110862 |  The danger is not averted just yet, driven shot from the edge of the box.
[480.08 - 481.08] P:1930.49 E:0.114204 |  Gabrielle is there again,
[481.08 - 484.08] P:1985.58 E:0.108622 |  and the Catholic Bill bow fans are pealing for a foul
[484.08 - 487.08] P:1962.33 E:0.112660 |  on how to get it on the edge of the box, and the referee agrees,
[487.08 - 489.08] P:1995.03 E:0.090473 |  and not only that, gives the free kick,
[489.08 - 491.08] P:1932.77 E:0.092540 |  and books Declan Rice for the challenge.
[491.08 - 494.08] P:1775.95 E:0.099094 |  Yeah, he's got his arms in the air, Declan Rice protesting his innocence to the referee,
[494.08 - 497.08] P:1766.47 E:0.097698 |  but it was clever play from Jaren Geitha there, central midfield,
[497.08 - 499.08] P:1842.09 E:0.103003 |  there's a deep line midfielder, he's always available,
[499.08 - 502.08] P:1832.69 E:0.097747 |  chips a ball over the top, looking for a Nackie Williams,
[502.08 - 506.08] P:1735.74 E:0.099438 |  ball comes back out to Jaren Geitha, looks to strike it first time,
[506.08 - 509.08] P:1733.05 E:0.106059 |  Declan Rice just gets there after he's made connection with the ball,
[509.08 - 511.08] P:1732.20 E:0.090935 |  over the top, catches the athletic club player,
[511.08 - 514.08] P:1722.97 E:0.085861 |  and they've got a free kick in a really dangerous area.
[514.08 - 517.08] P:1817.51 E:0.079743 |  Berengeir is one of those who stands over the ball,
[517.08 - 521.08] P:1923.54 E:0.074522 |  the left back Adama Boyro comes forward as well,
[521.08 - 523.08] P:1773.09 E:0.097658 |  and you can see how it would suit the left footer,
[523.08 - 526.08] P:1809.03 E:0.088435 |  because the ball is just outside the Arsenal penalty area,
[526.08 - 528.08] P:1780.30 E:0.093699 |  in the inside right channel.
[528.08 - 532.08] P:1766.29 E:0.091690 |  Arsenal have all the big men lined up in a one, two, three, four, five man wall,
[532.08 - 535.08] P:1870.08 E:0.087592 |  and someone's going to have to do the old draft excluder job as well,
[535.08 - 538.08] P:1866.49 E:0.101206 |  but at the moment David Ryre is down on his horses,
[538.08 - 542.08] P:1852.78 E:0.100795 |  he's all in green away to our right, getting the wall in the right position,
[542.08 - 546.08] P:1863.38 E:0.100047 |  it could be Alex Berengeir, and it could be Adama Boyro,
[546.08 - 550.08] P:1796.36 E:0.097890 |  and as you can hear, the stadium is pumped,
[550.08 - 560.08] P:1743.43 E:0.097752 |  bright white line of vanishing spray, just across the boot tops of the Arsenal defenders in that wall.
[560.08 - 566.08] P:1722.44 E:0.096551 |  David Ryre just trying to make sure he's got a view to the right-hand side of the Arsenal wall as he looks out,
[566.08 - 569.08] P:1683.35 E:0.101138 |  and the wall is going to try and protect the left of his goal for him,
[569.08 - 572.08] P:1855.41 E:0.098268 |  long shrill blast on the whistle, it is Berengeir, backheels it,
[572.08 - 576.08] P:1821.32 E:0.103674 |  Boyro hit that hard, ball is loose inside the Arsenal area,
[576.08 - 579.08] P:1914.14 E:0.101592 |  and it's cleared away by Timber, the shot was on target,
[579.08 - 581.08] P:1919.15 E:0.106209 |  it just couldn't get through all the bodies,
[581.08 - 584.08] P:1837.74 E:0.092996 |  now the cross comes into the Arsenal penalty area, Timber heads it away,
[584.08 - 587.08] P:1891.58 E:0.108176 |  Ezzer's going to chase, trying wind possession for Arsenal,
[587.08 - 589.08] P:1974.23 E:0.117209 |  he can't do that, more thunderous applause,
[589.08 - 593.08] P:1888.93 E:0.093191 |  brings around this stadium, and there's got to sabre the right back,
[593.08 - 597.08] P:1767.42 E:0.110415 |  playing back to Vivienne, and in the end they've come back to their goalkeeper.
[597.08 - 600.08] P:1700.07 E:0.110321 |  Spain's number one, Oonai Simon, all in bright orange,
[600.08 - 602.08] P:1852.22 E:0.081382 |  he's over hit that pass, it bounces twice,
[602.08 - 604.08] P:1859.34 E:0.083734 |  and his international teammate David Ryre,
[604.08 - 607.08] P:1801.37 E:0.083323 |  chests it down, and Arsenal will start to play out.
[607.08 - 610.08] P:1810.20 E:0.113794 |  That was a good set play that from Athletic Club, really well worked,
[610.08 - 612.08] P:1923.84 E:0.099250 |  Berengeir looked like he was going to strike the ball,
[612.08 - 615.08] P:1872.67 E:0.101687 |  and the Arsenal ball actually moved to the left when he was going to strike it,
[615.08 - 617.08] P:1836.74 E:0.105805 |  rolled it under the sole of his spot to Boyro,
[617.08 - 620.08] P:1757.99 E:0.090348 |  he struck it with his laces, thankfully for Arsenal,
[620.08 - 624.08] P:1725.01 E:0.086766 |  found his own player and made the block, no real danger.
[624.08 - 628.08] P:1702.17 E:0.084780 |  Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson with us at the San Mames Stadium,
[628.08 - 633.08] P:1722.23 E:0.080518 |  Athletic Bilbao, Arsenal 0, that is Mosquera,
[633.08 - 636.08] P:1742.66 E:0.084473 |  chips the ball to the right, Timber's got a leap there,
[636.08 - 640.08] P:1875.80 E:0.092535 |  now he can't keep that in play, wouldn't have even caught that with his hands
[640.08 - 643.08] P:1697.09 E:0.087457 |  at the peak of his jump, it was an over hit pass,
[643.08 - 646.08] P:1804.02 E:0.090964 |  it's gone out for the Athletic Bilbao throw,
[646.08 - 648.08] P:1943.61 E:0.103505 |  they've taken it, they've come back into their own half,
[648.08 - 652.08] P:1931.69 E:0.099243 |  and of course Kepper, who is now Arsenal's backup goalkeeper,
[652.08 - 656.08] P:1900.52 E:0.090880 |  was an Athletic Bilbao player, Chelsea bought him from this club
[656.08 - 661.08] P:1736.32 E:0.095328 |  for a massive, massive sum which was plowed back into facilities in the academy
[661.08 - 665.08] P:1702.78 E:0.082345 |  and such like, and has done a lot of good for the club,
[665.08 - 670.08] P:1829.46 E:0.099491 |  and Unais Simona has just continued as the club's goalkeeper all the way through.
[670.08 - 672.08] P:1803.11 E:0.101594 |  I've never been to the training facilities,
[672.08 - 675.08] P:1802.15 E:0.076455 |  but I can vouch that they're very plush and excellent,
[675.08 - 677.08] P:1815.96 E:0.090209 |  we flew over them yesterday, saw them as we came into land,
[677.08 - 680.08] P:1797.21 E:0.091140 |  and they're rather nice, they've got quite a few pitches,
[680.08 - 683.08] P:1953.87 E:0.096425 |  huge building with their crest and blazoned on the top of it,
[683.08 - 685.08] P:1946.10 E:0.095407 |  so that'll be thanks to Kepper.
[685.08 - 688.08] P:1930.50 E:0.088991 |  Yes indeed, here's Gabrielle, sticks the foot in,
[688.08 - 692.08] P:1827.97 E:0.087901 |  Ezzer, clever little ball over his right shoulder, releases Reiss,
[692.08 - 695.08] P:1910.73 E:0.104799 |  charges forward down the left, offside flag stays down,
[695.08 - 697.08] P:1937.59 E:0.113120 |  Yurkares in the penalty area with the cutback,
[697.08 - 701.08] P:1936.51 E:0.103722 |  intercepted by Viviane at the near post, then the offside flag goes up,
[701.08 - 705.08] P:1904.95 E:0.096311 |  so they were waiting to see what happened in the attacking phase of play,
[705.08 - 710.08] P:1789.27 E:0.083590 |  system referee raises his flag, and Athletic Bill Bow will have the free kick.
[710.08 - 714.08] P:1682.27 E:0.089142 |  Ten minutes in, Athletic Bill Bow, Arsenal nil, and I haven't heard otherwise,
[714.08 - 720.08] P:1712.64 E:0.093986 |  so I'm presuming, I'm just going to check PSV nil, Union Saint-Gilouin nil,
[720.08 - 725.08] P:1661.35 E:0.094161 |  which is the other early kickoff in the Champions League this afternoon,
[725.08 - 730.08] P:1663.66 E:0.081255 |  and we'll bring it up on my screen in just a second free kick coming here.
[730.08 - 736.08] P:1716.22 E:0.095060 |  For the home team, Unaise Simon places the ball down,
[736.08 - 741.08] P:1726.25 E:0.108670 |  seven, eight yards outside his own penalty area, drives it forward with his right foot
[741.08 - 744.08] P:1628.98 E:0.099090 |  to the edge of the Arsenal box, it bounces dangerously,
[744.08 - 747.08] P:1885.91 E:0.082992 |  Navarro will get there wide on the left, Timber is breathing down his neck,
[747.08 - 751.08] P:1947.86 E:0.095481 |  sticks the right foot in, and it goes out for the throwing to Athletic Bill Bow,
[751.08 - 756.08] P:1896.80 E:0.095334 |  and in fact, no I'm wrong, Union Saint-Gilouin have scored early in that game,
[756.08 - 759.08] P:1866.71 E:0.087163 |  so in the ninth minute they have taken the lead away from home against PSV,
[759.08 - 764.08] P:1781.05 E:0.093872 |  so that is your first goal in the Champions League, League phase this season,
[764.08 - 767.08] P:1643.47 E:0.096679 |  Union Saint-Gilouin playing in their first ever Champions League,
[767.08 - 771.08] P:1674.35 E:0.090543 |  they've taken the lead at PSV, long throw into the penalty area,
[771.08 - 774.08] P:1569.73 E:0.091493 |  all the rage nowadays, long throws, Miquel Arter was asked about that,
[774.08 - 777.08] P:1885.26 E:0.112348 |  was that a hand ball by Ezra, into his own box, referee says no,
[777.08 - 781.08] P:1885.54 E:0.091397 |  now for the Bill Bow though, have the ball on the right with Berenge,
[781.08 - 787.08] P:1847.38 E:0.087990 |  Berenge is shadowed by Ezra, plays the ball back to Haura Geitha,
[787.08 - 791.08] P:1737.61 E:0.096769 |  Sam Fett gets the ball back with a little back heel from Garas Sable,
[791.08 - 793.08] P:1867.29 E:0.114050 |  then the cross comes in with the far post, dangerous ball,
[793.08 - 797.08] P:1918.54 E:0.105981 |  Timber tries to head it away, and the Ackee Williams behind him couldn't control it
[797.08 - 799.08] P:1947.62 E:0.105193 |  but his head has gone behind for the goal kick, Niel Niel.
[799.08 - 802.08] P:1832.07 E:0.112998 |  They're looking more and more dangerous, Athletic Club has a wonderful ball
[802.08 - 805.08] P:1803.72 E:0.109662 |  across the six yard box there, no Arsenal defender could touch it,
[805.08 - 809.08] P:1709.69 E:0.106159 |  Timber actually does really well at the far post just to leave it to Anaki Williams,
[809.08 - 811.08] P:1688.22 E:0.089296 |  he's the one who ends up putting it out for a corner,
[811.08 - 814.08] P:1849.56 E:0.099404 |  but Sam Fett gets in on the right hand side, plays a really nice one too,
[814.08 - 817.08] P:1922.10 E:0.086033 |  lays the ball back and it's played right across the six yard box,
[817.08 - 821.08] P:2022.29 E:0.095700 |  very difficult to defend, Williams puts it out for a goal kick in the end.
[821.08 - 823.08] P:2070.61 E:0.101357 |  Athletic Bill Bow currently second in La Liga,
[823.08 - 825.08] P:2131.27 E:0.104530 |  started the season with three wins out of three,
[825.08 - 829.08] P:1940.30 E:0.100669 |  then rather surprisingly lost that home in this stadium at the weekend,
[829.08 - 831.08] P:1849.68 E:0.100206 |  local Derby as well against Alibis.
[831.08 - 834.08] P:1938.76 E:0.092522 |  Ryder clears first time with his right foot,
[834.08 - 837.08] P:1974.14 E:0.106251 |  that's not going to find a teammate, you've got a star belt,
[837.08 - 839.08] P:1899.89 E:0.097619 |  can let the ball bounce, you've got to play for a throw,
[839.08 - 843.08] P:1816.05 E:0.093462 |  in a relatively attacking position here for Athletic Bill Bow,
[843.08 - 847.08] P:1820.94 E:0.096935 |  Mikhail Artheta looks slightly exorcised, he's going to be warmed down there,
[847.08 - 851.08] P:1869.22 E:0.080182 |  dark black jumper, tight fitting grey trousers,
[851.08 - 854.08] P:1720.04 E:0.100260 |  black shiny shoes on the edge of the pitch here,
[854.08 - 858.08] P:1720.24 E:0.093315 |  Coradis plays the ball back to the goalkeeper, Simon,
[858.08 - 860.08] P:1696.26 E:0.064988 |  Simon delicately floats it forward,
[860.08 - 863.08] P:1685.31 E:0.091263 |  Berengueh sticks out the studs of his right boot, gets a touch on the ball,
[863.08 - 867.08] P:1849.68 E:0.101735 |  50-50 now, Ezra and Rice have lost it, here's Berengueh,
[867.08 - 871.08] P:1918.06 E:0.103954 |  dribbling forward for Athletic Bill Bow, hits the shot into the legs of Gabrielle,
[871.08 - 873.08] P:1962.37 E:0.112077 |  and it goes off the Brazilian for a corner.
[873.08 - 875.08] P:1929.88 E:0.102184 |  It's certainly on the front foot now, Athletic Club,
[875.08 - 878.08] P:1897.68 E:0.105737 |  Berengueh getting in some really dangerous positions on this right-hand side,
[878.08 - 880.08] P:1866.46 E:0.094416 |  over the most during the right-hand side,
[880.08 - 882.08] P:1891.64 E:0.093669 |  Santhet's drifting over to this right-hand side,
[882.08 - 884.08] P:1828.94 E:0.100931 |  taking on Calafuri, doubling up on him,
[884.08 - 886.08] P:1758.92 E:0.101299 |  Inaki Williams looking for the runs in behind,
[886.08 - 889.08] P:1970.69 E:0.101162 |  got the self a corner, but you can tell by the noise in the stadium,
[889.08 - 892.08] P:1681.36 E:0.090017 |  the team and the supporters are growing in confidence.
[893.08 - 896.08] P:1782.51 E:0.088224 |  Almost 14 minutes played, still 0-0,
[896.08 - 898.08] P:1630.53 E:0.099760 |  Berengueh with the corner away, swing ahead, it away at the near post,
[898.08 - 901.08] P:1910.80 E:0.098307 |  half folly from Jair Githa, goes straight up,
[901.08 - 904.08] P:1864.00 E:0.091666 |  and yeah, Rice spilled it, but he's OK, it bounced in front of him,
[904.08 - 908.08] P:1892.68 E:0.082555 |  and he catches it on that bounce and then runs out to the edge of the penalty area,
[908.08 - 910.08] P:1758.59 E:0.106873 |  made his 100th appearance for Arsenal,
[910.08 - 912.08] P:1821.43 E:0.070918 |  in the 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday,
[912.08 - 914.08] P:1619.28 E:0.092262 |  keeping a 40-second clean sheet,
[914.08 - 918.08] P:1811.11 E:0.090799 |  spoke really well, I thought, actually, in the press conference yesterday,
[918.08 - 921.08] P:1813.47 E:0.099356 |  here's Merino battling for the ball in the Arsenal midfield,
[921.08 - 923.08] P:1836.64 E:0.094927 |  he's down on the floor and he's lost it,
[923.08 - 926.08] P:1829.27 E:0.080359 |  so here come Athletic Bill Bow again,
[927.08 - 932.08] P:1873.62 E:0.108071 |  that is Sanfet, who's in this front two with Iñaki Williams,
[932.08 - 934.08] P:1895.95 E:0.109763 |  17 goals he scored last season,
[934.08 - 939.08] P:1867.28 E:0.086749 |  third top scorer in La Liga, behind Lewandowski and Dumbapé,
[940.08 - 943.08] P:1836.80 E:0.094415 |  there's Vivian, plays it into the midfield, to Jair Githa,
[943.08 - 946.08] P:1877.14 E:0.095256 |  short pass from him to his right-hand side to Sanfet,
[946.08 - 948.08] P:1724.49 E:0.093282 |  he's got Declan Rice in his way,
[948.08 - 951.08] P:1803.72 E:0.093705 |  Athletic Bill Bow working into the middle of the pitch here,
[951.08 - 954.08] P:1672.24 E:0.085270 |  and Vesga, Mikhail Vesga, one of the four changes,
[954.08 - 957.08] P:1744.13 E:0.090654 |  one of the ones to come into the starting line-up this evening,
[957.08 - 959.08] P:1725.55 E:0.095047 |  lays the ball off, makes a run through the middle of the pitch,
[959.08 - 961.08] P:1871.71 E:0.101104 |  Haldegi for the 21-year-old, nice turn and pass,
[961.08 - 964.08] P:1852.33 E:0.095235 |  Navarro to his right-hand side, here's Sanfet,
[964.08 - 968.08] P:1654.58 E:0.082799 |  Sanfet is closed down by Calafiori, pass comes back to Garasarbo,
[968.08 - 971.08] P:1858.85 E:0.101146 |  Beto and Gair just holds off the challenge there from Yurkárez,
[971.08 - 974.08] P:1853.41 E:0.095610 |  short pass to Navarro again, turning inside the box,
[974.08 - 977.08] P:1826.74 E:0.088436 |  then tries to chip a ball to the far post, blocked at close range,
[977.08 - 979.08] P:1834.76 E:0.119827 |  Merino wins ahead of, he's fouled in midair,
[979.08 - 983.08] P:2007.08 E:0.112511 |  he makes the most of that as he falls, sort of wriggling around,
[983.08 - 985.08] P:2025.35 E:0.093631 |  like a fish that's just been hoisted out of the river,
[985.08 - 988.08] P:1901.39 E:0.092589 |  and the referee's buying that and says free kick to Arsenal.
[988.08 - 990.08] P:1888.72 E:0.104323 |  I think he knows that his team needed that,
[990.08 - 992.08] P:1741.74 E:0.093431 |  Mikhail Merino, his team are a little bit under pressure there,
[992.08 - 994.08] P:1742.36 E:0.102337 |  they're not getting close enough at the moment, Arsenal,
[994.08 - 997.08] P:1655.70 E:0.094525 |  Athletic Club have kicked into gear, they're keeping the ball,
[997.08 - 999.08] P:1619.84 E:0.111045 |  they're rotating possession, they're finding the little pockets,
[999.08 - 1001.08] P:1765.17 E:0.104550 |  Arsenal playing with the three in midfield,
[1001.08 - 1004.08] P:1772.17 E:0.112013 |  Rice, Zubemendi and Merino, they're actually being very narrow,
[1004.08 - 1006.08] P:1848.64 E:0.086010 |  because of the way the Athletic Club are playing,
[1006.08 - 1009.08] P:1886.44 E:0.096598 |  which is forcing Eze and Maddoekki deeper to try and cover the wing-backs
[1009.08 - 1010.08] P:2028.40 E:0.102140 |  that are pushing on.
[1010.08 - 1013.08] P:2138.56 E:0.110063 |  Look at you giving it the old Athletic Club, getting him in the locals.
[1013.08 - 1016.08] P:2169.83 E:0.116500 |  That's what I've been told now, we all know what we're talking about, don't we?
[1016.08 - 1019.08] P:2119.61 E:0.104398 |  That lot in red and white, but by the way,
[1019.08 - 1023.08] P:2024.86 E:0.100542 |  I've never been inside a football stadium where almost every single person
[1023.08 - 1025.08] P:1941.10 E:0.105431 |  has got the home shirt on, it's red and white everywhere,
[1025.08 - 1027.08] P:1966.45 E:0.104790 |  it's like a sub-bouty old stadium, isn't it?
[1027.08 - 1029.08] P:2002.97 E:0.105748 |  And we were in the stadium quite early, but you showed me the footage
[1029.08 - 1032.08] P:1913.39 E:0.102997 |  when you were here last season of the build-up in the streets
[1032.08 - 1035.08] P:1966.58 E:0.094892 |  outside the ground as well, and it's just, again, a wash with everyone
[1035.08 - 1039.08] P:1898.23 E:0.107040 |  in the red and white shirts, Rice stretching, loses the ball inside his own half,
[1039.08 - 1044.08] P:1933.24 E:0.113599 |  and Gorsabel plays back to Unaise Simon, which is why one of my questions
[1044.08 - 1048.08] P:1718.79 E:0.096492 |  in the presentation last night was, can a kid grow up in this city
[1048.08 - 1050.08] P:1511.67 E:0.091040 |  and choose to support any other club?
[1050.08 - 1053.08] P:1610.11 E:0.103245 |  And the answer to that basically is no, you've got no chance.
[1053.08 - 1055.08] P:1625.76 E:0.075118 |  Absolutely no chance.
[1055.08 - 1058.08] P:1700.17 E:0.096732 |  But you can see the pride and the passion and what it means to the city.
[1058.08 - 1063.08] P:1634.89 E:0.102831 |  You talk about a one-club city, but actually the club is at the heart of the city, isn't it,
[1063.08 - 1064.08] P:1639.40 E:0.111782 |  where the stadium is?
[1064.08 - 1067.08] P:1685.25 E:0.100307 |  Merino is definitely fouled there by Boiro just short of the halfway line.
[1067.08 - 1070.08] P:1614.37 E:0.102208 |  Well, exactly, Paul, and you think about the club used to play for.
[1070.08 - 1073.08] P:1698.18 E:0.104199 |  Harry Kane playing for them, he's one of our own, he's one of our own, that's such a big thing.
[1073.08 - 1078.08] P:1584.63 E:0.103812 |  The entire team here, throughout their history, pretty much, they are all ones of their own.
[1078.08 - 1082.08] P:1621.02 E:0.094370 |  That is how it works, and that's why you have such an attachment to your football club.
[1082.08 - 1085.08] P:1677.52 E:0.100449 |  And the point, the other point that was made to me last night was when they lose games,
[1085.08 - 1090.08] P:1674.05 E:0.091667 |  the fans don't necessarily get on the team's back because they do feel as one with them.
[1090.08 - 1092.08] P:1659.22 E:0.100438 |  This is a good move, building up for Arsenal.
[1092.08 - 1097.08] P:1812.68 E:0.105736 |  Yurkares couldn't quite control the ball from Timber, hoisted away in the air again by Garasarba.
[1097.08 - 1102.08] P:1748.82 E:0.104936 |  Merino chases it back, awkward, couple of bounces here, Navarro behind him, gets it back to Raya,
[1102.08 - 1106.08] P:1872.29 E:0.090441 |  bobbling pass, and Raya clears it first time, chested down by Timber.
[1106.08 - 1110.08] P:1814.03 E:0.095271 |  Zubemendi's got time to get his head up here, lofts it on the half volley with his left foot.
[1110.08 - 1114.08] P:1771.18 E:0.112250 |  Yurkares sticks out a right boot, and barges into Peredes,
[1114.08 - 1119.08] P:1883.81 E:0.101753 |  and the assistant referee waves his flag and says that is going to be a free kick to Athletic Bill Bow.
[1119.08 - 1125.08] P:1600.00 E:0.087583 |  Athletic Bill Bow, Arsenal nil, and Union Sanjilwa, one nil up, away to PSV.
[1125.08 - 1130.08] P:1537.61 E:0.089916 |  Tottenham Villareal is our commentary at eight, and we'll bring you the goals from some great games tonight.
[1130.08 - 1135.08] P:1575.97 E:0.095137 |  Real Madrid in action at home against Marseille, Juventus against Borussia Dortmund,
[1135.08 - 1139.08] P:1514.93 E:0.088658 |  and Benfica against Carabag. It's back, Paul, the Champions League is back.
[1139.08 - 1143.08] P:1474.78 E:0.094564 |  You like saying that, don't you, that team's name? Which one? The one that played PSV?
[1143.08 - 1146.08] P:1502.89 E:0.112452 |  Union Sanjilwa. You like that, don't you?
[1146.08 - 1149.08] P:1749.83 E:0.088945 |  Well, Julianne LeRon got in touch, actually, before the show, and said,
[1149.08 - 1152.08] P:1600.36 E:0.089410 |  make sure you pronounce that right, so I'm probably butchering it, actually, to be fair,
[1152.08 - 1154.08] P:1532.05 E:0.076559 |  but giving it my best shot.
[1154.08 - 1159.08] P:1588.27 E:0.092671 |  Simon. Athletic Bill Bow's goalkeeper clears, it hits Califiori on the thigh,
[1159.08 - 1164.08] P:1627.07 E:0.090183 |  he then leans in, chest the ball down to himself, lays it back into Zubemendi,
[1164.08 - 1168.08] P:1602.15 E:0.102807 |  chip ball forward, intercepted by Peredes, scruffy football here at the moment,
[1168.08 - 1172.08] P:1609.72 E:0.098778 |  Mosquera lets that bounce, Timber jumps, wins ahead, Reno lent towards that.
[1172.08 - 1175.08] P:1760.06 E:0.100748 |  I think that might have hit his arm, yes, referee spotted that.
[1175.08 - 1178.08] P:1884.25 E:0.107261 |  That's going to be a free kick for Athletic.
[1178.08 - 1182.08] P:2013.75 E:0.113729 |  Scruffy, isn't it? Neither team really settled in the last five, six minutes or so.
[1182.08 - 1186.08] P:1842.29 E:0.096445 |  Interesting thing for Arsenal is Yorker as he's cutting a very, very lonely figure.
[1186.08 - 1190.08] P:1659.28 E:0.090613 |  Like I said, the possession that Athletic Bill Bow had, it's forced Eze and Maddoeki
[1190.08 - 1194.08] P:1611.63 E:0.087060 |  into more of a defensive position, so every time Arsenal have turned over possession,
[1194.08 - 1197.08] P:1713.66 E:0.089875 |  Yorker as he's isolated, he's chasing down lost causes.
[1197.08 - 1200.08] P:1595.80 E:0.077747 |  I'd be surprised if he's touched the ball more than once.
[1200.08 - 1204.08] P:1638.81 E:0.088949 |  Free kick then, Athletic Bill Bow, middle of the Arsenal half.
[1204.08 - 1206.08] P:1645.00 E:0.103125 |  He's in at pace, but it's straight at Ryre, he's in a good position,
[1206.08 - 1209.08] P:1661.58 E:0.086884 |  edge of the six yard box, and he puts his hands in front of his face
[1209.08 - 1213.08] P:1742.82 E:0.098185 |  and catches the ball cleanly, then bowls it out over, I'm a Calafiori,
[1213.08 - 1218.08] P:1841.59 E:0.096558 |  tall Italian, hair tied back, loads of space to work with, brings it up to the halfway line,
[1218.08 - 1222.08] P:1686.92 E:0.100709 |  one, two with Eze, back to Calafiori, the pass is beyond Gabrielle, no danger though.
[1222.08 - 1225.08] P:1771.31 E:0.093668 |  David Ryre's behind him, he comes and collects for Arsenal,
[1225.08 - 1228.08] P:1850.49 E:0.099427 |  and he quickly ships the ball out to the right-hand side.
[1228.08 - 1232.08] P:1779.08 E:0.100511 |  As we walked in, Paul, at a lower level, you felt the grass look quite long on this pitch tonight.
[1232.08 - 1236.08] P:1667.70 E:0.098378 |  It did, didn't it, as we came in, we were almost at pitch level, you could see.
[1236.08 - 1241.08] P:1875.47 E:0.090272 |  It's a pitch that's been heavily watered beforehand, as we know groundsmen,
[1241.08 - 1244.08] P:1995.92 E:0.105941 |  and women like to keep their pitch longer at this stage of the season
[1244.08 - 1247.08] P:1788.83 E:0.098970 |  to prevent any scars and any long-lasting damage.
[1247.08 - 1250.08] P:1664.74 E:0.093685 |  I don't think it will have any effect because it would be so wet.
[1250.08 - 1253.08] P:1680.26 E:0.112945 |  And the Accu-Williams lays the ball off, that's a miscube from Vesga,
[1253.08 - 1256.08] P:1809.03 E:0.111317 |  move was building nicely for Athletic Bill Bow, that's what I mean.
[1256.08 - 1259.08] P:1769.86 E:0.097480 |  You hear those sort of ooze and aahs of disappointment, and then it's applause,
[1259.08 - 1262.08] P:1623.95 E:0.093550 |  clearly they're back in the team because they're in good form.
[1262.08 - 1265.08] P:1572.08 E:0.108084 |  I was amazed, it was exactly the same when they lost 3-0 here to Manchester United,
[1265.08 - 1268.08] P:1688.71 E:0.105014 |  they had a man sent off, and actually they all stayed almost to the end
[1268.08 - 1270.08] P:1764.98 E:0.105888 |  to applaud the team for the effort that they'd given,
[1270.08 - 1273.08] P:1781.51 E:0.104580 |  whereas you don't always get that in football stadiums.
[1273.08 - 1276.08] P:1580.77 E:0.098277 |  You don't have to be from the Basque Country to manage the team though.
[1276.08 - 1280.08] P:1601.63 E:0.093873 |  Howard Kendall famously managed Athletic Bill Bow, back in the 80s,
[1280.08 - 1284.08] P:1613.74 E:0.095948 |  he just won the title with Everton, 1987, then came and managed here,
[1284.08 - 1287.08] P:1684.92 E:0.098902 |  they finished fourth in his first season in charge,
[1287.08 - 1290.08] P:1619.64 E:0.105089 |  didn't last too much longer after that, Marcelo Bielse has been in charge here,
[1290.08 - 1292.08] P:1522.24 E:0.095555 |  took them to Europa League final in 2012,
[1292.08 - 1295.08] P:1622.86 E:0.102117 |  Esza plays a nice one to his Ubers, gets it back to the Spaniard,
[1295.08 - 1298.08] P:1694.79 E:0.094365 |  space on the right hand side for Madwake for the first time this evening,
[1298.08 - 1302.08] P:1799.04 E:0.091444 |  ball bounces in front of him, suddenly two red and white shirted defenders are there,
[1302.08 - 1305.08] P:1724.06 E:0.102454 |  he's going to take on Navarro into the penalty area,
[1305.08 - 1309.08] P:1805.09 E:0.109125 |  two of them wrestling and jostling there, it's cleared away only as far as Rice,
[1309.08 - 1313.08] P:1767.81 E:0.087232 |  Timber takes a touch and Yuki Williams is back, Timbers nicked it off him,
[1313.08 - 1316.08] P:1714.94 E:0.101914 |  this could be good for Arsenal, Madwake back to Esza,
[1316.08 - 1319.08] P:1724.07 E:0.111034 |  back to Esza and the shot just as he was about to hit it,
[1319.08 - 1323.08] P:1798.19 E:0.097982 |  got a sabre slid in, cleared the ball, Esza's accidentally kicked him,
[1323.08 - 1325.08] P:1749.33 E:0.103886 |  and that will be a free kick to Athletic Bill Bow,
[1325.08 - 1328.08] P:1821.00 E:0.092631 |  for a second there, Esza must have been thinking, I'm going to score.
[1328.08 - 1330.08] P:1835.54 E:0.106195 |  He's got an empty net, he's just put his head in his hands,
[1330.08 - 1332.08] P:1833.89 E:0.109107 |  he surely thinks he's going to score,
[1332.08 - 1335.08] P:1914.14 E:0.104659 |  Garazable comes from absolutely nowhere, the right back,
[1335.08 - 1338.08] P:1725.80 E:0.106795 |  that's much better from Arsenal, really good from Zubemendi,
[1338.08 - 1342.08] P:1731.36 E:0.099320 |  he spreads it wide to Madwake, the first time that Arsenal really got any kind of width,
[1342.08 - 1345.08] P:1741.85 E:0.092124 |  Madwake wins the ball, takes on his attacking fallback,
[1345.08 - 1348.08] P:1751.78 E:0.095316 |  takes Timber, their win possession, Madwake gets into the 18-yard box
[1348.08 - 1351.08] P:1835.69 E:0.097268 |  and he lays it square to Esza, and it's come into his right foot,
[1351.08 - 1355.08] P:1641.08 E:0.097701 |  goalkeeper's committed himself, Esza looks like he's going to tap it into an empty net,
[1355.08 - 1358.08] P:1682.12 E:0.102751 |  but the right back, Garazable pinches it off him at the last second.
[1358.08 - 1361.08] P:1842.11 E:0.100051 |  Still getting used to wearing glasses for football commentary pool,
[1361.08 - 1363.08] P:1737.18 E:0.106148 |  they do, when it's warm, they fog up.
[1363.08 - 1365.08] P:1733.62 E:0.101670 |  I'm still getting used to seeing you with them.
[1366.08 - 1368.08] P:1579.97 E:0.108702 |  Are you okay there, they are a bit steamy.
[1368.08 - 1372.08] P:1655.69 E:0.090993 |  It needs a bit of air con like in the car, I need to blast the windscreen here,
[1372.08 - 1377.08] P:1638.29 E:0.083098 |  the seam on, long clearance from the free kick,
[1377.08 - 1379.08] P:1716.96 E:0.093181 |  and it clears the entire Arsenal back line,
[1379.08 - 1381.08] P:1671.69 E:0.100415 |  and Beringere was the only one who kept running,
[1381.08 - 1384.08] P:1625.62 E:0.089018 |  and he's got this ball for Athletic Bilbao, wide on the left,
[1384.08 - 1388.08] P:1795.73 E:0.094006 |  Mosquera chases him up towards the halfway line,
[1388.08 - 1393.08] P:1725.54 E:0.085776 |  the pass hits Mosquera, goes out for a throw in, which Boiro will take,
[1393.08 - 1396.08] P:1693.30 E:0.082453 |  and it's played back into the athletic half,
[1396.08 - 1398.08] P:1632.18 E:0.087312 |  and the two centre backs will both get a touch,
[1398.08 - 1400.08] P:1691.90 E:0.096357 |  Paredes plays across to Danny Vivian,
[1400.08 - 1405.08] P:1580.17 E:0.092681 |  was the player sent off in the semi-final first leg against Manchester United last season,
[1405.08 - 1407.08] P:1619.79 E:0.104954 |  Manchester United came here, one really well,
[1407.08 - 1410.08] P:1645.51 E:0.091825 |  probably one of the best performances actually under Ruben Amarim,
[1410.08 - 1411.08] P:1692.19 E:0.109528 |  one three-heel in the first leg,
[1411.08 - 1413.08] P:1684.06 E:0.104174 |  Jaregita playing the ball through to Navarro,
[1413.08 - 1415.08] P:1736.26 E:0.100594 |  Gabriele is there, gets his body in the way,
[1415.08 - 1418.08] P:1791.31 E:0.099629 |  important challenge for Arsenal, then his clearance is blocked by Navarro,
[1418.08 - 1420.08] P:1900.10 E:0.108022 |  and goes behind for the goal kick,
[1420.08 - 1422.08] P:1833.41 E:0.099599 |  but there's definitely a threat from the home team.
[1422.08 - 1424.08] P:1651.37 E:0.095845 |  Yeah, super defended from Gabriele though,
[1424.08 - 1426.08] P:1683.00 E:0.091089 |  his positional awareness is excellent,
[1426.08 - 1428.08] P:1585.07 E:0.089161 |  and even when he does get caught out of position,
[1428.08 - 1430.08] P:1699.13 E:0.102936 |  he's got the pace and awareness to get back goal side,
[1430.08 - 1433.08] P:1792.87 E:0.095084 |  got him behind there, it was a ball, slipped down the side of him,
[1433.08 - 1435.08] P:1725.88 E:0.096062 |  very, very clever, opens his body up,
[1435.08 - 1437.08] P:1689.68 E:0.097473 |  gets his body between the goal and the attacker,
[1437.08 - 1439.08] P:1712.36 E:0.085084 |  Berenguer shields the ball,
[1439.08 - 1441.08] P:1933.70 E:0.104631 |  knows exactly where his opposing player is,
[1441.08 - 1444.08] P:2055.56 E:0.098255 |  turns around, plays it off him and gets a goal kick,
[1444.08 - 1446.08] P:2038.96 E:0.103571 |  really good experience, defending.
[1446.08 - 1448.08] P:1847.41 E:0.094924 |  That's one thing that Arsenal have been excellent at, isn't it,
[1448.08 - 1450.08] P:1708.07 E:0.095172 |  over the recent months, defending hasn't been their issue.
[1450.08 - 1451.08] P:1622.66 E:0.040675 |  Yeah.
[1451.08 - 1456.08] P:1773.35 E:0.089222 |  Marino has lost it just inside the athletic half,
[1456.08 - 1460.08] P:1671.17 E:0.063268 |  and then he's got his parades, onto the ball,
[1460.08 - 1462.08] P:1647.35 E:0.097058 |  in the red and white stripes forward,
[1462.08 - 1464.08] P:1440.75 E:0.095275 |  it comes here to Santhet, inside his own half,
[1464.08 - 1467.08] P:1848.92 E:0.092945 |  back to Viviane, Viviane gives it a,
[1467.08 - 1470.08] P:1686.76 E:0.097642 |  a good clump of a pass back to his goalkeeper, Simon.
[1470.08 - 1472.08] P:1591.75 E:0.094916 |  Simon looks left and looks right,
[1472.08 - 1475.08] P:1653.99 E:0.090101 |  two Arsenal players close enough there to put him under threat,
[1475.08 - 1477.08] P:1711.42 E:0.103170 |  so he plays a long one down the middle,
[1477.08 - 1479.08] P:1698.20 E:0.105969 |  and the Acce Williams runs here with Moschera,
[1479.08 - 1482.08] P:1844.85 E:0.099456 |  Canafiori not the friendliest pass back to Raya,
[1482.08 - 1484.08] P:1836.70 E:0.094490 |  who just cushions the volley away,
[1484.08 - 1486.08] P:1764.98 E:0.084686 |  Canafiori then thumps it downfield with his left foot,
[1486.08 - 1488.08] P:1661.33 E:0.104188 |  Rice has just knocked off balance there as he went for the header,
[1488.08 - 1490.08] P:1776.98 E:0.094662 |  it's got Scrappy again here,
[1490.08 - 1492.08] P:1665.98 E:0.105773 |  now Marino is going to try and do something,
[1492.08 - 1495.08] P:1853.35 E:0.100272 |  little ball over the top, I think the flag is going to stay down there for Yurkares,
[1495.08 - 1497.08] P:1947.13 E:0.099061 |  and here he comes, Arsenal centre forward into the penalty area,
[1497.08 - 1500.08] P:1938.28 E:0.094936 |  angles tight, straight at Simon, he got his angles right,
[1500.08 - 1502.08] P:1836.25 E:0.097630 |  he makes the save and the flag does stay down,
[1502.08 - 1504.08] P:1749.00 E:0.105171 |  and I think Boiro might have been playing him on.
[1504.08 - 1507.08] P:1924.63 E:0.096777 |  He was, it was Boiro who was looking over at the assistant on the far side,
[1507.08 - 1509.08] P:1733.32 E:0.088185 |  the left back, put his hand in the air,
[1509.08 - 1510.08] P:1932.50 E:0.066652 |  went on the offside,
[1510.08 - 1512.08] P:1832.43 E:0.105692 |  Supermendi just flicks a simple ball over the top,
[1512.08 - 1515.08] P:1839.84 E:0.099158 |  Marino actually is, there's a simple ball over the top for Yurkares,
[1515.08 - 1517.08] P:1686.89 E:0.093585 |  but he's got half a length of the pitch to run,
[1517.08 - 1519.08] P:1728.42 E:0.115249 |  he's not that type of striker who enjoys that.
[1519.08 - 1524.08] P:1931.96 E:0.095985 |  Supermendi with a heavy challenge, a clumsy challenge in midfield,
[1524.08 - 1528.08] P:1808.07 E:0.080075 |  Howdy Geetha goes down, free kick given to Athletic Bill Bow,
[1528.08 - 1531.08] P:1594.25 E:0.092030 |  0-0 against Arsenal, going to say it again, Paul,
[1531.08 - 1533.08] P:1637.49 E:0.079607 |  Union Sanjidwa, they're still winning,
[1533.08 - 1536.08] P:1667.18 E:0.091474 |  1-0 up, away to PSV Eindhoven,
[1536.08 - 1539.08] P:1597.69 E:0.077008 |  Conor McNamara and Chris Sutton with your commentary,
[1539.08 - 1542.08] P:1722.63 E:0.108255 |  Tottenham against Villareal this evening,
[1542.08 - 1543.08] P:1709.72 E:0.080117 |  advantage played here,
[1543.08 - 1546.08] P:1684.96 E:0.100043 |  Santhet bringing it forward dangerously for Athletic Bill Bow,
[1546.08 - 1549.08] P:1740.32 E:0.098821 |  he's turned Gabrielle, Gabrielle's held him up for now,
[1549.08 - 1553.08] P:1758.19 E:0.087959 |  Santhet holds onto it, just shy of the Arsenal penalty area,
[1553.08 - 1556.08] P:1561.60 E:0.098577 |  back to Gorisabel, short passing field from him,
[1556.08 - 1560.08] P:1659.08 E:0.096456 |  that is good work from Marino, just hassles Howdy Geetha out of possession,
[1560.08 - 1562.08] P:1763.46 E:0.104640 |  holds him off, looks for Yurkares, strength from Yurkares,
[1562.08 - 1564.08] P:1674.09 E:0.102652 |  does well to turn Vivian,
[1564.08 - 1567.08] P:1817.49 E:0.099490 |  and now Maduake is going to be interested in the middle here,
[1567.08 - 1570.08] P:2002.99 E:0.111818 |  if Yurkares can get the ball in, or will he go it alone into the penalty area?
[1570.08 - 1574.08] P:1993.82 E:0.103590 |  Lays it back to Ezra, Ezra across here to Zubemendi,
[1574.08 - 1578.08] P:2041.69 E:0.118262 |  Zubemendi turns, Jeers and whistles to try and distract Arsenal,
[1578.08 - 1582.08] P:2074.93 E:0.119818 |  as the attack builds, Timbers involved on the right,
[1582.08 - 1586.08] P:2052.09 E:0.118633 |  Deckham Rice back into the team this evening, still no Erdogan,
[1586.08 - 1589.08] P:2029.99 E:0.115555 |  no Sacken, no Havertz, no Jezus, no Ben White,
[1589.08 - 1595.08] P:2032.48 E:0.111392 |  yet for Arsenal, as Mosquera plays across to Maduake,
[1595.08 - 1600.08] P:2029.06 E:0.109830 |  he's made an excellent start to life as an Arsenal player,
[1600.08 - 1604.08] P:2031.46 E:0.116733 |  he's some really good football, he's played for England this season as well,
[1604.08 - 1608.08] P:1822.04 E:0.115253 |  Marino just inside that athletic build, Bauer Hall, to Ezra,
[1608.08 - 1611.08] P:1583.13 E:0.110270 |  Ezra in his bright orange boots is allowed to turn,
[1611.08 - 1613.08] P:1599.22 E:0.096495 |  just dangles his right foot in front of the ball,
[1613.08 - 1617.08] P:1790.56 E:0.096022 |  offers a dummy back to Gabrielle, wide it comes to Calafiori on the left,
[1617.08 - 1620.08] P:1974.26 E:0.108923 |  Calafiori shuffles in field, still going, good dribbling,
[1620.08 - 1624.08] P:1841.83 E:0.103827 |  Yurkares now lays it off to Zubemendi, Rice has it 30 yards out,
[1624.08 - 1627.08] P:1948.78 E:0.108214 |  plays to his right, Timbers cross, that looks like a good ball,
[1627.08 - 1631.08] P:1744.34 E:0.098084 |  Yurkares heads just wide, diving header bravely through himself at it,
[1631.08 - 1634.08] P:1604.11 E:0.107128 |  and I think it would have really fancied his chances of burying it,
[1634.08 - 1636.08] P:1763.64 E:0.111635 |  quick clearance from the goal kick,
[1636.08 - 1638.08] P:1716.91 E:0.098530 |  David Ryzen in a good position for Arsenal,
[1638.08 - 1641.08] P:1703.49 E:0.112562 |  because Iñaki Williams was racing onto that and Ryzen well out of his box,
[1641.08 - 1643.08] P:1868.18 E:0.098679 |  heads it away, Paul Robinson.
[1643.08 - 1646.08] P:1702.77 E:0.102071 |  Much better from Arsenal, they look so much better when they're trying to impose
[1646.08 - 1649.08] P:1568.48 E:0.107589 |  themselves rather than sitting deep and trying to nick possession back
[1649.08 - 1652.08] P:1644.00 E:0.109164 |  when they're in possession and they're asserting themselves onto the game,
[1652.08 - 1654.08] P:1697.79 E:0.098579 |  playing on the front foot, that's when they look a lot better,
[1654.08 - 1657.08] P:1672.25 E:0.100428 |  an earlier chance down the right-hand side from Madoeke,
[1657.08 - 1659.08] P:1657.97 E:0.103308 |  that time it was a wonderful ball into the box from Timber,
[1659.08 - 1662.08] P:1713.94 E:0.110188 |  and that's what they've been missing, a play like Yurkares throwing himself,
[1662.08 - 1664.08] P:1883.12 E:0.104500 |  old-style diving header goes really close.
[1664.08 - 1668.08] P:1867.33 E:0.093291 |  Yeah, I was thinking Keith Houch in 1987, that's the one isn't it, the classic,
[1668.08 - 1670.08] P:1867.48 E:0.088290 |  and it was like that, he really lost.
[1670.08 - 1674.08] P:1902.87 E:0.109423 |  But that's what they've missed Arsenal, we've talked so long about Arsenal missing,
[1674.08 - 1677.08] P:1698.13 E:0.090106 |  that number nine, but in Yurkares that looks like what they've got,
[1677.08 - 1679.08] P:1885.98 E:0.098775 |  I mean he's got three and four already this season,
[1679.08 - 1683.08] P:1783.57 E:0.092988 |  but that type of ball into the box, they haven't one been put in that type of ball
[1683.08 - 1686.08] P:1817.29 E:0.097304 |  into the box, or two had a player that would throw himself like that at it.
[1686.08 - 1690.08] P:1828.30 E:0.096706 |  Yeah, six goals and six champions league starts for Yurkares last season as well
[1690.08 - 1693.08] P:1820.10 E:0.100336 |  for Sporty, including a hat-trick against Manchester City, Madoeke,
[1693.08 - 1696.08] P:1786.30 E:0.106659 |  taking on Boyro, gets the cross in Wings Arsenal, a corner,
[1696.08 - 1701.08] P:1793.36 E:0.097135 |  first corner of the game for Arsenal, and we know the threat they pose from these,
[1701.08 - 1704.08] P:1657.15 E:0.100844 |  and this game has two to throw, because first ten minutes or so,
[1704.08 - 1707.08] P:1682.17 E:0.096191 |  Arsenal had a lot of the ball they looked in control,
[1707.08 - 1711.08] P:1632.70 E:0.098619 |  then Athletic Bilbao took over for a bit, it's a good old arm wrestle,
[1711.08 - 1715.08] P:1583.33 E:0.094172 |  David Ryan needs a drink, obviously racing out of his box to win the header,
[1715.08 - 1719.08] P:1845.70 E:0.106107 |  his thirsty work, so he's come to the edge of the pitch to collect that,
[1719.08 - 1722.08] P:1970.24 E:0.106755 |  Madoeke is taking his time here, ball tucked under his left arm.
[1722.08 - 1726.08] P:1810.98 E:0.104952 |  I think there's more to that for Ray, I think he's carrying some instructions,
[1726.08 - 1729.08] P:1684.63 E:0.101491 |  I think that's why Madoeke is delaying taking the corner.
[1729.08 - 1730.08] P:1762.93 E:0.072726 |  OK.
[1731.08 - 1733.08] P:1831.75 E:0.106210 |  And here it comes then, shortly from the right-hand side,
[1733.08 - 1737.08] P:1814.03 E:0.096232 |  after that it built down 0 Arsenal, 0, no, short one to Zuba Mendi,
[1737.08 - 1741.08] P:1844.51 E:0.098906 |  back to Madoeke, controls it, then crosses with his left boot,
[1741.08 - 1746.08] P:1658.44 E:0.095456 |  header off target, well off target from Moskera, might bounce to Ezra,
[1746.08 - 1749.08] P:1763.43 E:0.102337 |  Ezra does well, stretches out a right leg, controls the ball,
[1749.08 - 1751.08] P:1681.84 E:0.098493 |  takes it on the dribble down the right,
[1751.08 - 1754.08] P:1787.28 E:0.095200 |  challenge comes in from Iñaki Williams,
[1754.08 - 1757.08] P:1775.09 E:0.117544 |  and he knocks it out of play for a throw into Arsenal,
[1757.08 - 1759.08] P:1859.59 E:0.086619 |  down by the corner flag on the right-hand side,
[1759.08 - 1761.08] P:1634.60 E:0.095189 |  Timber as the ball above his head,
[1761.08 - 1764.08] P:1617.07 E:0.085877 |  thinks about going quickly, but Madoeke's got his back turn,
[1764.08 - 1767.08] P:1650.72 E:0.094928 |  so there's not an option to do that.
[1769.08 - 1772.08] P:1651.45 E:0.098707 |  I've let it build down 0 Arsenal, 0, Zuba Mendi has to stretch,
[1772.08 - 1774.08] P:1775.65 E:0.106920 |  couldn't find Califuri with the pass,
[1774.08 - 1777.08] P:1850.44 E:0.092404 |  Navarro's going to operate from deep here for Athletic,
[1777.08 - 1779.08] P:1865.35 E:0.106404 |  plays across to Gorisarbol,
[1779.08 - 1782.08] P:1665.72 E:0.084804 |  Ezra closes him down, that'll pass forward to Navarro,
[1782.08 - 1784.08] P:1776.80 E:0.105341 |  get a right little shimmy in front of the ball there,
[1784.08 - 1786.08] P:1869.25 E:0.097756 |  but it worked because he lost the attention of Marino,
[1786.08 - 1789.08] P:1753.98 E:0.089590 |  Vesga, short pass to his left to Boyro,
[1789.08 - 1793.08] P:1580.66 E:0.082486 |  and everything calms down, and Athletic Bilbao go at walking pace,
[1793.08 - 1796.08] P:1612.28 E:0.095593 |  so this is Arsenal's first game in the Champions League,
[1796.08 - 1799.08] P:1513.80 E:0.100491 |  next up is Olympiakos at home,
[1799.08 - 1802.08] P:1503.09 E:0.089182 |  and then Athletic home Madrid at home.
[1802.08 - 1805.08] P:1465.17 E:0.080665 |  Next couple coming Arsenal's way in this competition,
[1805.08 - 1807.08] P:1583.88 E:0.098334 |  as Paul said before the game,
[1807.08 - 1809.08] P:1652.99 E:0.103450 |  did really well in the league phase last season,
[1809.08 - 1811.08] P:1447.59 E:0.102716 |  six wins, one draw, one defeat,
[1811.08 - 1813.08] P:1683.97 E:0.099244 |  the only defeat away to Inter,
[1813.08 - 1815.08] P:1723.05 E:0.096334 |  Madoeke wants a free kick,
[1815.08 - 1817.08] P:1794.66 E:0.095751 |  thought he was hauled to the floor by Boyro,
[1817.08 - 1819.08] P:1627.06 E:0.098013 |  but to deal with Madoeke, Madoeke gets the decision.
[1819.08 - 1821.08] P:1801.53 E:0.084185 |  That's when Arsenal look better,
[1821.08 - 1825.08] P:1761.17 E:0.099580 |  they look better when there are strengths in the wide areas,
[1825.08 - 1828.08] P:1639.23 E:0.095240 |  when Madoeke are in a higher position rather than defending,
[1828.08 - 1831.08] P:1652.65 E:0.089215 |  Arsenal get the ball, push the two players wide,
[1831.08 - 1833.08] P:1644.09 E:0.088857 |  Madoeke's certainly a threat,
[1833.08 - 1835.08] P:1762.93 E:0.083434 |  I saw him for England in midweek, he was absolutely excellent,
[1835.08 - 1837.08] P:1557.75 E:0.081071 |  I think he was obviously the player of the game for me,
[1837.08 - 1839.08] P:1530.03 E:0.101811 |  I just think the impact he's had,
[1839.08 - 1842.08] P:1616.80 E:0.085260 |  I know there's a lot of Arsenal fans that weren't overly convinced when they signed him,
[1842.08 - 1844.08] P:1610.96 E:0.088635 |  I think that's a bit of an understatement in all honestly,
[1844.08 - 1847.08] P:1780.32 E:0.085086 |  but I think the freedom that he's got and the way that he's playing,
[1847.08 - 1849.08] P:1594.56 E:0.083415 |  and the way that Miquel Artheta's managing him,
[1849.08 - 1851.08] P:1738.55 E:0.086006 |  I think definitely in an England shirt,
[1851.08 - 1853.08] P:1804.78 E:0.089790 |  and you see in glimpses of it already in an Arsenal shirt.
[1853.08 - 1858.08] P:1914.98 E:0.085335 |  Declan Rice trying to make himself heard inside this cavernous stadium,
[1858.08 - 1860.08] P:1899.31 E:0.089307 |  shouting as he's about to take this free kick,
[1860.08 - 1863.08] P:1857.51 E:0.086889 |  which Madoeke won out on the right,
[1863.08 - 1865.08] P:1938.67 E:0.100619 |  Rice holds his left arm in the air,
[1865.08 - 1867.08] P:1784.67 E:0.092256 |  kills that in with his right foot,
[1867.08 - 1869.08] P:1710.80 E:0.096927 |  powerful header from Gabriele's off-target, well off-target,
[1869.08 - 1872.08] P:1732.89 E:0.093636 |  and I think he might have headed his own player as well,
[1872.08 - 1874.08] P:1735.05 E:0.081520 |  because two Arsenal players are down,
[1874.08 - 1877.08] P:1595.30 E:0.093510 |  and Gabriele is going to need some attention.
[1877.08 - 1879.08] P:1627.47 E:0.078744 |  Yorcares is the other.
[1879.08 - 1882.08] P:1617.04 E:0.099430 |  Yeah, there's a really well-worked set-players you would expect from Arsenal.
[1882.08 - 1885.08] P:1588.29 E:0.093874 |  Interesting that Athletic Club just held the line on the edge of the box,
[1885.08 - 1889.08] P:1717.55 E:0.094335 |  didn't pick up man-for-man, all the Arsenal players starting the group at the edge of the box,
[1889.08 - 1891.08] P:1854.03 E:0.087067 |  right at the back of the defensive line,
[1891.08 - 1894.08] P:1787.12 E:0.098810 |  and then they made a run individually, tried to break through the line,
[1894.08 - 1896.08] P:1728.38 E:0.090720 |  they ended up with a free header, Yorcares.
[1899.08 - 1901.08] P:1397.98 E:0.088244 |  Just watching the replay there.
[1901.08 - 1905.08] P:1605.84 E:0.099214 |  Yorcares and Gabriele, Yorcares has definitely come off the worst of the two, hasn't he?
[1905.08 - 1909.08] P:1668.54 E:0.088281 |  Gabriele is headed, Yorcares, he's headed the ball, and Yorcares,
[1909.08 - 1913.08] P:1656.93 E:0.089480 |  so the back of Yorcares' head has taken the full brunt of that.
[1913.08 - 1916.08] P:1717.36 E:0.096761 |  So slight stoppage in play, 15 minutes left in the first arc,
[1916.08 - 1919.08] P:1705.13 E:0.093138 |  you're listening to the Champions League on five live and BBC sounds,
[1919.08 - 1921.08] P:1646.96 E:0.092855 |  top them against Villarreal,
[1921.08 - 1924.08] P:1605.87 E:0.097800 |  there's our commentary at eight o'clock this evening,
[1924.08 - 1927.08] P:1430.72 E:0.116459 |  and Paul, you've spotted on the TV pictures here,
[1927.08 - 1929.08] P:1520.71 E:0.109150 |  blood streaming from Yorcares' head.
[1929.08 - 1932.08] P:1507.34 E:0.113545 |  Yeah, we're going to have a long break in play here.
[1932.08 - 1934.08] P:1516.92 E:0.117060 |  He's bent over and all forced, right over the penalty spot,
[1934.08 - 1936.08] P:1474.34 E:0.106840 |  he's got the physio on, won't be long before the doctor comes on,
[1936.08 - 1938.08] P:1534.11 E:0.119578 |  just seeing it close up on the screen,
[1938.08 - 1941.08] P:1515.51 E:0.105684 |  he's got blood trickling down the side of his face.
[1942.08 - 1945.08] P:1383.54 E:0.104752 |  Well, Yorcares not afraid to throw himself about,
[1945.08 - 1947.08] P:1456.88 E:0.095396 |  put himself in dangerous situations,
[1947.08 - 1950.08] P:1575.75 E:0.096758 |  has come closest in this first half with the diving header
[1950.08 - 1952.08] P:1498.85 E:0.091552 |  that was just off target,
[1952.08 - 1954.08] P:1594.64 E:0.091747 |  and at the moment receiving medical attention,
[1954.08 - 1956.08] P:1495.24 E:0.078361 |  so Mikhail Artejeda has a good chance here
[1956.08 - 1958.08] P:1583.73 E:0.094156 |  to get the tactical instructions onto the team.
[1958.08 - 1960.08] P:1688.56 E:0.084616 |  So yes, Tottenham Villarreal tonight,
[1960.08 - 1963.08] P:1664.48 E:0.088660 |  tomorrow night, Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin in Munich,
[1963.08 - 1965.08] P:1738.04 E:0.092750 |  for Bayern Munich against Chelsea,
[1965.08 - 1968.08] P:1522.58 E:0.083367 |  will have updates on Liverpool against Atletico,
[1968.08 - 1970.08] P:1776.73 E:0.087499 |  and on Thursday night, choice of listening,
[1970.08 - 1974.08] P:1546.34 E:0.098264 |  Champions League commentaries, Newcastle Barcelona on five live,
[1974.08 - 1976.08] P:1621.96 E:0.098327 |  John Murray will be at St James's Park,
[1976.08 - 1980.08] P:1529.70 E:0.085206 |  Manchester City against Napoli on Sports Extra,
[1980.08 - 1983.08] P:1631.08 E:0.091084 |  and then Sunday, I'm just going to flag this one up as well, Paul,
[1983.08 - 1986.08] P:1601.88 E:0.092936 |  because, I mean, Arsenal in a sense have a bit of an advantage this week,
[1986.08 - 1989.08] P:1534.99 E:0.099162 |  they play tonight, and Manchester City play Thursday,
[1989.08 - 1992.08] P:1691.69 E:0.085100 |  it's Arsenal, Manchester City on Sunday at half four,
[1992.08 - 1994.08] P:1557.07 E:0.094764 |  we've got full commentary on that one.
[1994.08 - 1995.08] P:1731.06 E:0.081805 |  It's a huge advantage, isn't it?
[1995.08 - 1997.08] P:1493.63 E:0.104217 |  I mean, Tuesday to Thursday, a big difference recovery,
[1997.08 - 2000.08] P:1635.57 E:0.104555 |  and obviously with the game being an early kickoff here this evening,
[2000.08 - 2003.08] P:1588.19 E:0.097013 |  the Arsenal players will jump on the plane as soon as they're finished,
[2003.08 - 2007.08] P:1745.26 E:0.112287 |  and more than likely we'll be back in London and back home before, what, 12, one o'clock.
[2007.08 - 2010.08] P:1844.55 E:0.104103 |  So maybe a morning off tomorrow morning to recover,
[2010.08 - 2014.08] P:1821.10 E:0.097758 |  and then a long time to prep, more than Manchester City get ahead of the game on Sunday.
[2014.08 - 2018.08] P:1684.18 E:0.082019 |  Jürkaer still receiving treatment, he's in a sort of praying position,
[2018.08 - 2022.08] P:1597.71 E:0.097544 |  he's on his knees, his back is straight, his head is bent forward,
[2022.08 - 2025.08] P:1642.53 E:0.091904 |  and they've got some tight black bandage wrapped tightly around his head,
[2025.08 - 2028.08] P:1612.22 E:0.094800 |  and that is a sharp haircut, that isn't it, Jürkaer?
[2028.08 - 2031.08] P:1765.00 E:0.114329 |  It's not going to be looking sharp after this though, is it?
[2031.08 - 2032.08] P:1794.91 E:0.101832 |  No, that's...
[2032.08 - 2035.08] P:1857.27 E:0.105327 |  What can we give our listeners an image, a Terry Butcher?
[2035.08 - 2036.08] P:1802.03 E:0.095344 |  Yeah, a little bit.
[2036.08 - 2039.08] P:1746.93 E:0.091401 |  It's a Terry Butcher, but it's black tape, black heavy tape, isn't it?
[2039.08 - 2042.08] P:1816.60 E:0.083757 |  And not, not, you know, oceans and oceans of blood,
[2042.08 - 2045.08] P:1849.60 E:0.090952 |  the famous picture of Terry after a game against Sweden.
[2045.08 - 2047.08] P:1747.96 E:0.096671 |  By the way, talking Terry Butcher, the other thing,
[2047.08 - 2051.08] P:1852.44 E:0.085665 |  because I love looking into the history of football clubs and stadiums,
[2051.08 - 2056.08] P:1881.14 E:0.108547 |  this is the new San Mamma Stadium, which was opened in 2013,
[2056.08 - 2059.08] P:1960.61 E:0.097529 |  the old one lasted for 100 years.
[2059.08 - 2063.08] P:1847.18 E:0.099207 |  If people like me, and I was a young kid at the time, I think I was nine years old,
[2063.08 - 2067.08] P:1692.09 E:0.088127 |  1982, I came back from school, England against France,
[2067.08 - 2069.08] P:1704.79 E:0.101282 |  opening group game of the World Cup for England,
[2069.08 - 2072.08] P:1811.14 E:0.094266 |  in those fantastic England kits that I loved then.
[2072.08 - 2075.08] P:1579.55 E:0.104525 |  Throw in from Steve Coppel, 27 seconds into the game,
[2075.08 - 2080.08] P:1752.40 E:0.097649 |  Terry Butcher flick on, and an athletic Brian Robson left footed finish
[2080.08 - 2084.08] P:1663.14 E:0.105903 |  in the old San Mamma Stadium, England won the game by three goals to one,
[2084.08 - 2086.08] P:1618.34 E:0.098402 |  Robson got two, and Mariner got the other.
[2086.08 - 2089.08] P:1754.81 E:0.079108 |  That's one of my very first football memories, Paul.
[2089.08 - 2090.08] P:1788.53 E:0.102931 |  What year was that, 82?
[2090.08 - 2091.08] P:1520.89 E:0.090677 |  82.
[2091.08 - 2093.08] P:1573.53 E:0.099752 |  That seemed a long time ago now, doesn't it?
[2093.08 - 2096.08] P:1791.58 E:0.096683 |  Those old kits that are now coming back and they're very cool to wear.
[2096.08 - 2099.08] P:1564.85 E:0.099282 |  England's women won the Euros this summer in something very similar, actually.
[2099.08 - 2102.08] P:1694.79 E:0.085276 |  Great kit there, his Sam there on the turn.
[2102.08 - 2105.08] P:1651.01 E:0.095993 |  Spinning high ball to the right to Gorisarble,
[2105.08 - 2108.08] P:1721.98 E:0.100033 |  Gorisarble plays it back to Navarra, handball!
[2108.08 - 2113.08] P:1662.56 E:0.094439 |  Says the referee, who is Donatas Romsas from Lithuania.
[2113.08 - 2114.08] P:1498.12 E:0.093935 |  What have you spotted, Paul?
[2114.08 - 2115.08] P:1608.64 E:0.081566 |  He's back on, Yorker is.
[2115.08 - 2116.08] P:1604.30 E:0.086896 |  Oh, yeah.
[2116.08 - 2118.08] P:1596.25 E:0.102834 |  He's back on, referee's just giving him permission to come back on.
[2118.08 - 2120.08] P:1833.51 E:0.100869 |  Heavily bandaged on this near side.
[2122.08 - 2124.08] P:1783.52 E:0.109736 |  So, free kick Arsenal, Gabrielle will take it.
[2124.08 - 2128.08] P:1858.74 E:0.101389 |  11 minutes to the first half remaining, Athletic Bill bound 0, Arsenal 0.
[2128.08 - 2132.08] P:1721.96 E:0.088489 |  Steve Crossman back with us at half time.
[2132.08 - 2134.08] P:1691.10 E:0.090488 |  This is one thing that I've noticed, not just with Arsenal,
[2134.08 - 2137.08] P:1656.41 E:0.096377 |  but across the Premier League and leagues in Europe as well.
[2137.08 - 2140.08] P:1824.53 E:0.089932 |  They've got a free kick Arsenal, five yards outside their 18-yard box.
[2140.08 - 2142.08] P:1795.89 E:0.079016 |  There's no questions now, it's going long.
[2142.08 - 2145.08] P:1809.02 E:0.097657 |  They're going to put it in an area, they're going to be allowed to play in a certain area,
[2145.08 - 2148.08] P:1751.60 E:0.082264 |  but we're not going to put the ball at risk if we don't need to, it's going long.
[2148.08 - 2150.08] P:1700.17 E:0.094301 |  And they did that immediately from the kick-off as well.
[2150.08 - 2153.08] P:1861.32 E:0.105474 |  Do you know what, if Yorker has put a better touch on that ball
[2153.08 - 2155.08] P:1809.95 E:0.098507 |  and maybe still a little bit groggy after a whack on the head,
[2155.08 - 2159.08] P:1738.01 E:0.100197 |  he suddenly then would have had it just outside the Athletic Bill bow area
[2159.08 - 2161.08] P:1732.08 E:0.104517 |  with players running off him, so it worked.
[2161.08 - 2164.08] P:1698.26 E:0.114410 |  There's a lot to be said for doing things in one go rather than six or seven.
[2164.08 - 2166.08] P:1750.24 E:0.092566 |  Maybe more passes sometimes.
[2166.08 - 2171.08] P:1780.48 E:0.097703 |  You cause yourself more problems at times, playing in areas that you don't really need to.
[2171.08 - 2173.08] P:1815.28 E:0.087215 |  And like we say, we're seeing a big shift this year.
[2173.08 - 2175.08] P:1686.70 E:0.101591 |  Well, and that was really interesting actually.
[2175.08 - 2178.08] P:1669.76 E:0.099390 |  Michael Artheta was asked about that in the press conference yesterday as well,
[2178.08 - 2181.08] P:1632.39 E:0.102215 |  about the set pieces, the long throws, the longer balls from the back.
[2181.08 - 2186.08] P:1682.84 E:0.096955 |  And he basically said, you have got to be, you're going to win in the Premier League Champions League.
[2186.08 - 2189.08] P:1618.68 E:0.095292 |  You have got to be the best in every single department of the game.
[2189.08 - 2190.08] P:1692.21 E:0.107787 |  No stone unturned.
[2190.08 - 2193.08] P:1637.16 E:0.077943 |  Look at everything forensically.
[2193.08 - 2195.08] P:1605.81 E:0.106542 |  And that is how you win.
[2195.08 - 2198.08] P:1618.69 E:0.092645 |  And even then, obviously you might not because it's fine margins.
[2198.08 - 2203.08] P:1553.03 E:0.099391 |  But that's certainly what he does and what plenty of other football managers do as well.
[2203.08 - 2208.08] P:1662.95 E:0.096302 |  Ten minutes left in the first half, still 0-0, still a great noise inside the stadium.
[2208.08 - 2215.08] P:1769.53 E:0.098446 |  Calafiore fires a low pass back to Gabrielle, plays it across to Mosquera, the young Spaniard
[2215.08 - 2218.08] P:1520.78 E:0.094838 |  with the dark blue Arsenal shirt untucked, long sleeves.
[2218.08 - 2223.08] P:1653.36 E:0.084013 |  Here's Timber, Julian Timber across to Mosquera again.
[2223.08 - 2226.08] P:1604.25 E:0.102150 |  Mosquera forward to Rice, Rice under pressure from Santhet,
[2226.08 - 2229.08] P:1565.40 E:0.087068 |  who's chasing him across that Arsenal half.
[2229.08 - 2232.08] P:1601.98 E:0.092879 |  Wide to Timber, back again to Mosquera.
[2232.08 - 2235.08] P:1688.67 E:0.102089 |  Mosquera takes a couple of touches, looking for an avenue to pass into.
[2235.08 - 2237.08] P:1747.30 E:0.102009 |  There it is on the right.
[2237.08 - 2241.08] P:1768.53 E:0.108180 |  Timber then looks for the run of Madwake, and Madwake is pulled Boidrow back.
[2241.08 - 2244.08] P:1807.01 E:0.102695 |  And the two of them there, there was a bit of tugging, pulling and whatever.
[2244.08 - 2247.08] P:1730.35 E:0.092633 |  But eventually Madwake, not subtle enough, wasn't going to get to that ball.
[2247.08 - 2249.08] P:1654.39 E:0.069677 |  And it's a free kick for Athletic.
[2249.08 - 2251.08] P:1442.08 E:0.102353 |  It's a game very much being played in the middle of the pitch, isn't it?
[2251.08 - 2254.08] P:1576.77 E:0.103284 |  I mean, we talked about a couple of opportunities for either side,
[2254.08 - 2256.08] P:1527.67 E:0.109823 |  but there's been no real clear cut opportunities.
[2256.08 - 2260.08] P:1564.23 E:0.098778 |  Probably the best opportunity was Yorker as he's diving headed through himself at.
[2260.08 - 2264.08] P:1638.39 E:0.093930 |  But actually when you talk about Simon and Rea, we haven't really talked about them much,
[2264.08 - 2268.08] P:1604.80 E:0.081389 |  which tells you where the game's been played the majority of the time.
[2268.08 - 2273.08] P:1710.08 E:0.093538 |  Free kick then for Athletic Bill Bow, which Unai Simon will take.
[2273.08 - 2278.08] P:1745.03 E:0.098729 |  And again, it's going to go long because Athletic Bill Bow and the red and white
[2278.08 - 2280.08] P:1780.41 E:0.100453 |  vertical stripes have cleared their half.
[2280.08 - 2283.08] P:1716.11 E:0.096213 |  Simon goes directly from left to right across the pitch.
[2283.08 - 2287.08] P:1681.86 E:0.097706 |  Califuri nods it down, Ezra stretched, controlled it well,
[2287.08 - 2289.08] P:1495.62 E:0.100228 |  then tries to roll a pass down the left.
[2289.08 - 2292.08] P:1769.63 E:0.104923 |  Califuri will chase that. He won't get there, got a sabre, is there first
[2292.08 - 2294.08] P:1648.15 E:0.089788 |  and plays back to his goalkeeper.
[2294.08 - 2297.08] P:1613.21 E:0.101710 |  Doesn't look right, Yorkers. I mean, he's taken that blow to his head.
[2297.08 - 2301.08] P:1656.01 E:0.093948 |  He's got his head heavily strapped. There's a through ball there that he wasn't quite switched on.
[2301.08 - 2303.08] P:1642.57 E:0.102446 |  It's a little bit groggy to me.
[2303.08 - 2306.08] P:1657.95 E:0.100083 |  Interesting. The ball down the inside left channel for Athletic Bill Bow.
[2306.08 - 2308.08] P:1682.22 E:0.093868 |  And Yaki Williams goes tearing after it.
[2308.08 - 2312.08] P:1645.85 E:0.098690 |  Rea's there first, scoops it over his head, plays to Madwake.
[2312.08 - 2316.08] P:1778.83 E:0.102916 |  Madwake back here to Moschera. Rea under pressure this time.
[2316.08 - 2320.08] P:1884.39 E:0.110234 |  Low curling ball in between two Athletic Bill Bow players that were very close to him.
[2320.08 - 2323.08] P:1734.65 E:0.120034 |  Rice looking to win the ball in the half-way. He's on a yellow card.
[2323.08 - 2326.08] P:1879.69 E:0.112758 |  He's caught Garisable. It will be a free kick.
[2326.08 - 2331.08] P:2028.65 E:0.105324 |  And you can hear what the Athletic fans are trying to get across to the referee here.
[2331.08 - 2334.08] P:1903.72 E:0.098281 |  I don't think there's any malice in that for Declan Rice.
[2334.08 - 2337.08] P:1859.85 E:0.081827 |  He just late, just caught the player on his way through.
[2337.08 - 2341.08] P:1712.96 E:0.085629 |  But as you heard in the background, home support, they know exactly who's on a yellow card.
[2341.08 - 2344.08] P:1691.75 E:0.090936 |  Yeah, he was slightly late though, Declan Rice, looking at that.
[2344.08 - 2346.08] P:1785.46 E:0.092688 |  Got to be careful. Ball forward from the free kick.
[2346.08 - 2349.08] P:1751.52 E:0.108854 |  And also, they've caught sleep in there, bearing gear nearly got him,
[2349.08 - 2352.08] P:1645.79 E:0.083950 |  the offside flag is up. Doesn't matter because it ran through to David Rea,
[2352.08 - 2355.08] P:1663.99 E:0.092154 |  and he's bowled it out underarm this time to Timber.
[2355.08 - 2359.08] P:1724.07 E:0.098002 |  And Arsenal can start to play inside their own half.
[2359.08 - 2362.08] P:1706.24 E:0.091212 |  It's got to look this stadium as well from the outside.
[2362.08 - 2365.08] P:1654.52 E:0.083914 |  Modern stadium, big dome.
[2365.08 - 2369.08] P:1686.43 E:0.085360 |  Lots and lots of sort of triangular shaped panels,
[2369.08 - 2371.08] P:1609.61 E:0.105107 |  which obviously light up in the evening.
[2371.08 - 2373.08] P:1630.42 E:0.096329 |  You can sort of show all sorts of things on those.
[2373.08 - 2377.08] P:1630.50 E:0.091171 |  But I thought as we approach it today, it looked like you could actually stack a pack of cards
[2377.08 - 2381.08] P:1624.60 E:0.096199 |  in a stadium shape. It looks like loads of playing cards all stacked on top of each other.
[2381.08 - 2384.08] P:1556.32 E:0.106887 |  You've been trying to replicate it in your room this afternoon.
[2384.08 - 2386.08] P:1754.14 E:0.102727 |  Is that what you've been doing? You've not been doing your notes really?
[2386.08 - 2387.08] P:1624.41 E:0.084640 |  Absolutely no chance of that.
[2387.08 - 2390.08] P:1728.23 E:0.104954 |  This is one of those stadiums that if you like going around the world, around Europe,
[2390.08 - 2393.08] P:1611.21 E:0.092260 |  or in the UK, whatever, visiting football stadiums,
[2393.08 - 2395.08] P:1576.83 E:0.089494 |  this is one that you don't necessarily think of.
[2395.08 - 2397.08] P:1598.55 E:0.093939 |  But I've been here a couple of times before.
[2397.08 - 2400.08] P:1559.92 E:0.095056 |  This is an absolute must visit for the whole matchday experience,
[2400.08 - 2403.08] P:1780.77 E:0.096364 |  the build up, the city, the streets, the game.
[2403.08 - 2406.08] P:1691.81 E:0.116875 |  Just to see all these supporters in red and white and the noise.
[2406.08 - 2408.08] P:1822.76 E:0.103158 |  It's a great place, it really is.
[2408.08 - 2411.08] P:1746.21 E:0.093818 |  Tottenham fans, Paul's Old Club, a fond memories of course.
[2411.08 - 2416.08] P:1923.12 E:0.097870 |  This is where they beat Manchester United to win the Europa League final back in May.
[2416.08 - 2418.08] P:2042.14 E:0.111742 |  Arsenal playing out from inside their own half.
[2418.08 - 2421.08] P:2018.29 E:0.100397 |  Good pace and pass into the path of Madwake up against Boiro.
[2421.08 - 2424.08] P:1947.10 E:0.101074 |  Takes him on the outside, then checks for a second.
[2424.08 - 2426.08] P:1855.77 E:0.106815 |  Little flick of the ball into Berengea.
[2426.08 - 2427.08] P:1693.34 E:0.106281 |  Arsenal winner throw on the right.
[2427.08 - 2429.08] P:1673.64 E:0.081888 |  Six minutes for the first half remaining.
[2429.08 - 2431.08] P:1606.21 E:0.110719 |  Plus a little bit of added time.
[2431.08 - 2433.08] P:1677.81 E:0.103652 |  I think there's going to be a good four or five minutes of that,
[2433.08 - 2436.08] P:1619.86 E:0.104995 |  but it's a Yurka as a situation to the wild to deal with.
[2436.08 - 2439.08] P:1686.27 E:0.100493 |  Arsenal's biggest threat again, Madwake down the right-hand side.
[2439.08 - 2442.08] P:1524.81 E:0.083827 |  Been very, very narrow as he always tucks in.
[2442.08 - 2445.08] P:1978.31 E:0.106595 |  And actually the biggest threat has come when Timbers overlap to Madwake.
[2445.08 - 2446.08] P:2050.70 E:0.073407 |  He's on the ball.
[2446.08 - 2448.08] P:2079.12 E:0.101160 |  Arsenal have it on the right.
[2448.08 - 2454.08] P:1972.02 E:0.094113 |  That's Zubemendi, former Real Sociedad player.
[2454.08 - 2456.08] P:1853.39 E:0.099084 |  One of the big rivals here of Athletic Bilbao.
[2456.08 - 2458.08] P:1756.81 E:0.103008 |  As was Mikael Marino.
[2458.08 - 2459.08] P:1596.77 E:0.088152 |  There's Zubemendi.
[2459.08 - 2462.08] P:1618.38 E:0.103137 |  His little flick pass intercepted.
[2462.08 - 2465.08] P:1675.60 E:0.101146 |  Come on, Antonio Salabini.
[2465.08 - 2470.08] P:1913.81 E:0.110152 |  MC can drawann...
[2470.08 - 2473.08] P:2033.37 E:0.108936 |  Lord Gar herself has got it...
[2473.08 - 2476.08] P:1973.12 E:0.104992 |  an answer needless i'
[2476.08 - 2478.08] P:1828.47 E:0.090359 |  ko
[2478.08 - 2482.56] P:1725.54 E:0.110578 |  sw
[2482.56 - 2486.56] P:1817.92 E:0.110155 |  Chen
[2486.56 - 2491.56] P:1871.78 E:0.101970 | atter
[2491.56 - 2496.12] P:1803.34 E:0.101467 |  2, Arsenal on the left, Union, Sanjil, Yves got a second, Paul.
[2496.12 - 2499.28] P:1815.84 E:0.090711 |  PSV, Niel, USG.
[2499.28 - 2501.92] P:1687.66 E:0.103331 |  Two, maybe you've been seeing a lot more of them this season.
[2501.92 - 2503.72] P:1689.15 E:0.110924 |  But that was a great tackle by Eze, wasn't it?
[2503.72 - 2504.92] P:1748.82 E:0.075666 |  A real old-fashioned challenge.
[2504.92 - 2506.72] P:1652.09 E:0.101830 |  Certainly didn't expect him to leave the ground
[2506.72 - 2508.56] P:1633.87 E:0.098533 |  and put in a sliding challenge like that on Vivian.
[2508.56 - 2510.12] P:1771.65 E:0.109781 |  And Vivian certainly didn't like it.
[2510.12 - 2511.72] P:1752.47 E:0.112782 |  He's known for his robustness.
[2511.72 - 2514.56] P:1731.98 E:0.112054 |  He, in turn, returned the favour, didn't he, honestly?
[2514.56 - 2516.56] P:1702.70 E:0.105536 |  When you say Vivian, I mean, that's going to take me back
[2516.56 - 2518.20] P:1564.09 E:0.089385 |  to the 80s and the young ones as well.
[2518.20 - 2521.80] P:1515.54 E:0.095613 |  So there's all sorts of stuff ringing around my head here.
[2521.80 - 2526.36] P:1676.09 E:0.094135 |  Long throw into the penalty area, headed away by athletic Bill Bow.
[2526.36 - 2529.36] P:1715.47 E:0.092400 |  Califuri steps in to win it back for Arsenal,
[2529.36 - 2532.56] P:1776.26 E:0.082599 |  waits for the ball to drop, gets away from Vesca.
[2532.56 - 2534.44] P:1735.64 E:0.109968 |  Then the pass there is behind Zubemendi.
[2534.44 - 2537.04] P:1888.85 E:0.098299 |  And it was all a bit sort of scruffy after the set piece.
[2537.04 - 2538.64] P:1835.90 E:0.088097 |  Everyone was getting reorganised.
[2538.64 - 2540.04] P:1623.47 E:0.108416 |  Arsenal didn't really know what to do with that.
[2540.04 - 2542.04] P:1482.59 E:0.084132 |  And it's gone out for a throw-in to athletic Bill Bow.
[2542.04 - 2543.72] P:1637.78 E:0.105283 |  It's been a scruffy type of game.
[2543.72 - 2546.20] P:1661.15 E:0.096628 |  I mean, we're just passing the 41-minute mark now.
[2546.20 - 2548.00] P:1725.58 E:0.108167 |  No real team you could say is on top.
[2548.00 - 2550.40] P:1677.95 E:0.092213 |  As I said, it's played a lot in the middle of the park.
[2550.40 - 2551.96] P:1718.71 E:0.097763 |  But for Arsenal, it's job done.
[2551.96 - 2554.36] P:1563.59 E:0.094417 |  I mean, a draw here is not a disaster.
[2554.36 - 2556.76] P:1593.88 E:0.088579 |  A clean sheet will be important to them,
[2556.76 - 2558.68] P:1610.12 E:0.099285 |  as we know defensively, they're very good.
[2558.68 - 2560.96] P:1679.25 E:0.096207 |  But actually for them to be at this stage of the game,
[2560.96 - 2561.92] P:1691.82 E:0.106653 |  job done thus far.
[2561.92 - 2563.52] P:1815.83 E:0.088649 |  Here's Mabwaki, edge of the penalty area.
[2563.52 - 2564.64] P:1801.44 E:0.091794 |  Can it get better for Arsenal?
[2564.64 - 2567.80] P:1821.90 E:0.090937 |  Low shot block, ball spins out to Zubemendi.
[2567.80 - 2570.64] P:1944.06 E:0.098642 |  30 yards out, sees Timber in space on his right.
[2570.64 - 2573.44] P:2058.10 E:0.101018 |  Timbers put the most dangerous cross of the game in in this first half.
[2573.44 - 2575.72] P:2007.58 E:0.085925 |  He's inside the penalty area now.
[2575.76 - 2578.52] P:1920.29 E:0.092597 |  Lays it out to the right to Mabwaki.
[2578.52 - 2580.44] P:1969.79 E:0.113335 |  Athletic Bill Bow defenders all in the line.
[2580.44 - 2581.44] P:2036.46 E:0.095194 |  10 yards from their goal.
[2581.44 - 2582.84] P:1963.47 E:0.094353 |  Mabwaki twisting and turning.
[2582.84 - 2585.12] P:1828.68 E:0.087323 |  Cross comes in, hits the back of one of those defenders.
[2585.12 - 2587.76] P:1817.97 E:0.091810 |  How to geitha, bouncing ball.
[2587.76 - 2588.96] P:1609.49 E:0.114210 |  Clears it away with his right foot.
[2588.96 - 2590.04] P:1584.74 E:0.109101 |  Timber heads it in the air.
[2590.04 - 2592.64] P:1634.35 E:0.084788 |  Zubemendi wins the next header.
[2592.64 - 2594.92] P:1677.77 E:0.108632 |  Timber gets a touch on that, chases it down to the ball.
[2594.92 - 2597.40] P:1810.11 E:0.109235 |  And keeps it in and gets the cross in.
[2597.40 - 2601.96] P:1833.08 E:0.105130 |  This hurting self-doing that is down behind the dead ball line.
[2601.96 - 2603.64] P:1783.83 E:0.108150 |  Paredes just checks he's OK.
[2603.64 - 2606.48] P:1653.27 E:0.100712 |  Play's going to continue and Arsenal are down to 10 men.
[2606.48 - 2607.48] P:1745.63 E:0.121085 |  Really at the moment.
[2607.48 - 2609.80] P:1747.47 E:0.086756 |  Moskera's come across to the right back position.
[2609.80 - 2611.56] P:1654.76 E:0.103305 |  And Athletic Bill Bow spotted the weakness here.
[2611.56 - 2613.00] P:1645.45 E:0.093405 |  They're attacking down that left-hand side.
[2613.00 - 2615.16] P:1666.76 E:0.116669 |  And Nacky Williams sees the run of Behrangir.
[2615.16 - 2617.20] P:1656.37 E:0.115910 |  Into the penalty area, across the face of goal.
[2617.20 - 2618.68] P:1812.95 E:0.097518 |  And behind for the goal kick.
[2618.68 - 2620.24] P:1827.12 E:0.096261 |  David Ryad dives.
[2620.24 - 2621.80] P:1823.73 E:0.090587 |  He had that covered.
[2621.80 - 2624.08] P:1788.85 E:0.112233 |  There was one player, Athletic Bill Bow player.
[2624.08 - 2626.40] P:1712.55 E:0.104679 |  It was it's Santhe, racing through the middle,
[2626.40 - 2630.00] P:1651.98 E:0.111552 |  who was a couple of metres away from getting a right boot on that.
[2630.00 - 2631.60] P:1595.77 E:0.109707 |  They would have put it in the back of the net.
[2631.64 - 2633.72] P:1564.18 E:0.114694 |  Arsenal's point of view, Jury and Timber.
[2633.72 - 2636.64] P:1634.21 E:0.109549 |  He got himself injured by the corner flag and he stayed off the pitch.
[2636.64 - 2638.68] P:1724.34 E:0.108572 |  And immediately Athletic Club could see that weakness.
[2638.68 - 2641.68] P:1805.56 E:0.085672 |  And like you said, Moskera went over to the right back position.
[2641.68 - 2643.76] P:1892.75 E:0.106540 |  Paredes and Gehran, the end cuts inside and he shot.
[2643.76 - 2646.20] P:1896.41 E:0.085714 |  It's a cross, come shot, wasn't it?
[2646.20 - 2647.52] P:1971.61 E:0.108096 |  Sanse couldn't get on the end of it.
[2647.52 - 2649.72] P:2107.23 E:0.087812 |  David Ryad dived across but didn't save.
[2649.72 - 2650.96] P:2134.56 E:0.096481 |  That is definitely one, by the way.
[2650.96 - 2652.44] P:2063.87 E:0.080892 |  I've just thought for the glossary.
[2652.44 - 2654.48] P:2071.84 E:0.096561 |  For the commentators view, the great glossary of football commentary.
[2654.48 - 2655.92] P:1992.80 E:0.085552 |  The cross, come shot.
[2655.92 - 2657.52] P:1919.50 E:0.089985 |  Surely that is only football.
[2657.52 - 2659.80] P:1748.97 E:0.102310 |  That has to be. You must have had that by now.
[2659.80 - 2660.88] P:1914.82 E:0.088120 |  Here's Madwake.
[2660.96 - 2664.48] P:1763.67 E:0.105425 |  Dribbling again for Arsenal, taking on defenders into the athletic penalty area
[2664.48 - 2666.76] P:1859.51 E:0.090348 |  and then he's lost it and he's fouled his man.
[2666.76 - 2668.76] P:1911.10 E:0.110658 |  And that is going to be a free kick for the home team.
[2668.76 - 2673.08] P:1909.71 E:0.107215 |  We're into the 44th minute of an intriguing Champions League game.
[2673.08 - 2676.04] P:1934.09 E:0.100809 |  Arsenal knew it was going to be tough and it has been so far.
[2676.04 - 2679.88] P:1684.63 E:0.094879 |  And Athletic Bill Bowen-Neal, Arsenal, Neal, PSV, Neal,
[2679.88 - 2682.40] P:1697.20 E:0.106984 |  Ounee and Sanjid Wah, two.
[2682.40 - 2684.68] P:1770.54 E:0.119951 |  They're not going to have it all the way tonight, Arsenal.
[2684.68 - 2686.40] P:1855.59 E:0.104463 |  We knew that before the start of the game.
[2686.40 - 2689.32] P:1767.06 E:0.117883 |  Defensively very robust, as Bill Boweside.
[2689.32 - 2693.00] P:1720.03 E:0.112131 |  But what Arsenal have done, they haven't really come under any threat in the goal.
[2693.00 - 2695.76] P:1725.65 E:0.115750 |  On the two occasions they've had half chances at the home side.
[2695.76 - 2697.72] P:1698.62 E:0.115390 |  But nothing that's really threatened David Reyes' goal
[2697.72 - 2702.04] P:1711.33 E:0.099076 |  or forced him into any kind of action to make him at Neal, to make a save.
[2702.04 - 2704.28] P:1540.99 E:0.082465 |  They've kept everything fairly much in front of them.
[2704.28 - 2706.12] P:1589.79 E:0.088948 |  At times they haven't had possession, Arsenal.
[2706.12 - 2708.52] P:1648.73 E:0.076153 |  They've been comfortable in a defensive shape.
[2708.52 - 2711.68] P:1615.04 E:0.090090 |  You can see a couple of athletic fans just making their way back to their seats.
[2711.68 - 2715.64] P:1799.60 E:0.109117 |  They've beaten the crowds and she has got an enormous tub of popcorn.
[2715.64 - 2718.08] P:1953.75 E:0.075551 |  She's going to have to share some of that
[2718.12 - 2719.40] P:1796.43 E:0.120607 |  with the people sitting around her.
[2719.40 - 2720.96] P:1855.12 E:0.111253 |  Never going to be able to finish that.
[2720.96 - 2724.04] P:1853.79 E:0.109340 |  She sits down a few rows in front of us and the ball goes behind.
[2724.04 - 2724.96] P:1853.77 E:0.107376 |  No, it's a throw-in.
[2724.96 - 2729.68] P:1908.65 E:0.078068 |  The referee is saying that's a throw-in for Athletic Bill Bowes.
[2729.68 - 2732.64] P:1755.54 E:0.091834 |  And an attacking position wide on the left.
[2732.64 - 2734.00] P:1658.70 E:0.098439 |  Let it build down Neal.
[2734.00 - 2734.88] P:1812.04 E:0.106188 |  Arsenal, Neal.
[2734.88 - 2738.68] P:1770.48 E:0.095621 |  Stay in touch with the Champions League goings on this evening.
[2738.68 - 2743.20] P:1717.82 E:0.085169 |  Champions League final score available by the iPlayer website and app
[2743.20 - 2744.64] P:1631.47 E:0.094856 |  alongside our commentary.
[2744.64 - 2747.80] P:1651.72 E:0.102148 |  Just another way you can stay across everything while you're listening to us.
[2747.84 - 2748.96] P:1561.49 E:0.108392 |  Long throw into the Arsenal area.
[2748.96 - 2751.40] P:1650.53 E:0.095884 |  Mosquera heads it down and away, head to the box,
[2751.40 - 2754.04] P:1826.02 E:0.099400 |  right stretches and a sliding challenge on him.
[2754.04 - 2757.24] P:1822.97 E:0.098863 |  Turns into a shot on goal, really, from Danny Vivienne.
[2757.24 - 2760.44] P:1746.97 E:0.092476 |  It goes well wide at the target and behind for an Arsenal goal kick.
[2760.44 - 2762.24] P:1620.37 E:0.103585 |  They look to be comfortable defensively, Arsenal.
[2762.24 - 2764.32] P:1780.14 E:0.088071 |  They look to have it sussed out earlier in the game.
[2764.32 - 2767.28] P:1799.30 E:0.091447 |  Athletic Club were getting down the side of them at times.
[2767.28 - 2770.08] P:1817.91 E:0.094754 |  And you could see them just, you know, the two centre halves.
[2770.08 - 2772.00] P:1844.52 E:0.102525 |  Gabriella Mosquera just trying to work it out.
[2772.00 - 2773.40] P:1839.33 E:0.082274 |  But as the game's gone on,
[2773.40 - 2776.08] P:1771.81 E:0.090125 |  the threat from Athletic Club has become less and less.
[2776.08 - 2777.84] P:1780.74 E:0.116555 |  And the threats become less in wider areas.
[2777.84 - 2780.72] P:1734.14 E:0.084533 |  It's not coming down the middle in the width of the 18-yard box.
[2780.72 - 2782.44] P:1611.05 E:0.091763 |  The threat and the danger that they've had
[2782.44 - 2786.20] P:1652.92 E:0.088624 |  has been wider than the 18-yard box and has materialised in nothing.
[2786.20 - 2788.08] P:1631.90 E:0.100018 |  Three minutes of added time.
[2788.08 - 2792.08] P:1792.54 E:0.084678 |  We look down from our steepling commentary position here
[2792.08 - 2795.00] P:1629.82 E:0.093670 |  in the San Mamas Stadium in Bilbao.
[2795.00 - 2796.92] P:1428.96 E:0.092691 |  Let it Bilbao-nil, Arsenal-nil.
[2796.92 - 2799.32] P:1573.38 E:0.093167 |  Ryers goal kick headed forward by Santhe.
[2799.32 - 2803.48] P:1618.72 E:0.097727 |  Gabrielle powers ahead of down the left, over the head of Ezra.
[2803.48 - 2804.84] P:1779.13 E:0.109782 |  Challenge from Marino.
[2804.84 - 2808.36] P:1731.53 E:0.093700 |  That's a foul on Santhe, free kick for Athletic Bilbao.
[2808.36 - 2811.48] P:1585.72 E:0.082975 |  Did I just say three minutes of added time? You did. Yeah. OK.
[2811.48 - 2816.24] P:1667.96 E:0.086864 |  Good. And we've played 90 seconds of that.
[2816.24 - 2820.68] P:1692.09 E:0.107190 |  So Danny Vivian, who was the player sent off
[2820.68 - 2824.72] P:1578.29 E:0.104157 |  for Athletic Bilbao in that semi-final against Manchester United,
[2824.72 - 2828.28] P:1824.08 E:0.103941 |  the three-nil defeat, they then lost four-one-an-old Trafford.
[2828.28 - 2830.44] P:1658.66 E:0.115902 |  Manchester United got themselves through to that final,
[2830.44 - 2833.44] P:1529.08 E:0.099702 |  but couldn't get the job done in this stadium against Tottenham.
[2833.44 - 2835.56] P:1455.76 E:0.093879 |  Vivian takes the free kick forward.
[2835.56 - 2837.72] P:1634.63 E:0.105698 |  It's like Miss Q from Gabrielle on the clearance,
[2837.72 - 2839.40] P:1653.99 E:0.098282 |  still defending for Arsenal to do.
[2839.40 - 2842.92] P:1593.62 E:0.093485 |  Here's Navarro, who's got little blonde highlights at the front of his fringe,
[2842.92 - 2844.72] P:1706.57 E:0.111665 |  through the legs, cleverly, of Ryse there.
[2844.72 - 2846.96] P:1750.55 E:0.109293 |  And Yaki Williams, low ball, cross the face of goal.
[2846.96 - 2849.80] P:1727.60 E:0.092737 |  It's OK for Arsenal, runs through their penalty area.
[2849.80 - 2852.36] P:1671.24 E:0.094046 |  And Madueke collects it in the right back position,
[2852.36 - 2854.92] P:1635.69 E:0.102273 |  played to Marino, fell that touch on the edge of the box.
[2854.92 - 2858.48] P:1777.45 E:0.108813 |  Had to be good there. Forward to Yurkares, physical battle with Paredes.
[2858.48 - 2861.32] P:1848.69 E:0.105793 |  Paredes drags into the ground, free kick Arsenal.
[2861.32 - 2863.52] P:1680.51 E:0.113661 |  Timber takes it quickly. Madueke is away here,
[2863.52 - 2865.16] P:1790.73 E:0.097268 |  and the referee has said he'd play.
[2865.16 - 2866.84] P:1840.08 E:0.102122 |  Madueke pauses for a second there.
[2866.84 - 2869.88] P:1825.47 E:0.110738 |  He's now on the attack, arrowing into the box, looks for the cutback,
[2869.88 - 2873.44] P:1729.83 E:0.113352 |  last touch, came off the Arsenal player, cross-hit the defender,
[2873.44 - 2876.04] P:1809.50 E:0.106004 |  then hit Madueke, goes behind for the goal kick.
[2876.04 - 2878.92] P:1699.75 E:0.103444 |  Paredes is complaining that Arsenal shouldn't have been able to go
[2878.92 - 2881.76] P:1658.43 E:0.097592 |  with the quick free kick, and Unai Simon races out and says,
[2881.76 - 2884.40] P:1690.04 E:0.088521 |  look, don't get involved, it's fine. It's our goal kick.
[2884.40 - 2887.52] P:1552.13 E:0.099975 |  Well, they're quite happy now, because it's come to nothing, it's a goal kick.
[2887.52 - 2891.04] P:1561.57 E:0.105025 |  But they're absolutely raving. Vivian and Paredes immediately straight out
[2891.08 - 2893.44] P:1545.44 E:0.109255 |  to surround the referee. I don't know what the problem is, though.
[2893.44 - 2896.16] P:1649.61 E:0.119722 |  The free kick was given, nobody was within ten yards of the ball,
[2896.16 - 2898.12] P:1718.54 E:0.107482 |  there was nobody stopping the quick free kick.
[2898.12 - 2900.84] P:1701.43 E:0.115755 |  Timber saw that the free kick was on, he put Madueke in.
[2900.84 - 2902.84] P:1695.81 E:0.115490 |  Madueke actually half-stopped right, he said, didn't he?
[2902.84 - 2904.36] P:1596.15 E:0.113409 |  But then he realised he was through.
[2904.36 - 2906.04] P:1664.35 E:0.119391 |  There was no reason the referee should have stopped that.
[2906.04 - 2908.24] P:1485.24 E:0.093113 |  It was good, quick thinking by Arsenal.
[2908.24 - 2912.24] P:1381.53 E:0.092008 |  Red and white stripes bouncing in rhythm,
[2912.24 - 2914.88] P:1575.13 E:0.104102 |  and that two-tiered stand behind the goal away to our left,
[2914.88 - 2916.88] P:1464.81 E:0.094207 |  defended by the home team in the first half,
[2916.88 - 2919.52] P:1486.47 E:0.086952 |  let it build down, Arsenal nil.
[2919.52 - 2923.52] P:1557.35 E:0.114817 |  The Champions League this season underway, Gabrielle jumps,
[2923.52 - 2925.52] P:1618.17 E:0.093308 |  the ball comes off his forehead, goes behind him,
[2925.52 - 2928.16] P:1854.08 E:0.104502 |  but through to his goalkeeper, David Ryder.
[2928.16 - 2932.24] P:2037.26 E:0.111912 |  Half-time at PSV, two-nil down at home against Union Sanjou,
[2932.24 - 2934.00] P:2043.92 E:0.102463 |  the Belgians.
[2934.00 - 2935.64] P:2011.16 E:0.121042 |  Declan Rice on the ball for Arsenal,
[2935.64 - 2937.64] P:1981.40 E:0.103621 |  20 seconds remaining in the first half,
[2937.64 - 2940.92] P:1920.40 E:0.104905 |  Yurka Rez is diving head-up, the closest Arsenal of Karn.
[2940.92 - 2943.56] P:1677.13 E:0.108911 |  Gabrielle tries to thread one through to Califari, intercepted,
[2943.56 - 2945.84] P:1643.48 E:0.113830 |  here's Navarro, brings it forward for Athletic Bill,
[2945.84 - 2948.32] P:1765.45 E:0.109093 |  Boul, lines up the shot, deflected, and behind it goes.
[2948.32 - 2950.72] P:1865.88 E:0.114180 |  For a late corner in the first half to the home team.
[2950.72 - 2953.28] P:1753.28 E:0.113720 |  Arsenal got to guard against his complacency,
[2953.28 - 2954.84] P:1663.23 E:0.122426 |  in very, very comfortable possession.
[2954.84 - 2957.44] P:1676.48 E:0.111170 |  Gabrielle, that time, looks to thread a ball into midfield,
[2957.44 - 2960.80] P:1603.91 E:0.115209 |  but he gives it away, gives the ball away really cheaply,
[2960.80 - 2962.92] P:1541.83 E:0.115110 |  shot deflected and away for a corner.
[2962.92 - 2965.32] P:1615.65 E:0.109975 |  Arsenal, just get concentration, keep clean sheets,
[2965.32 - 2969.00] P:1524.30 E:0.093834 |  don't cause yourself your own problems, which is what they did.
[2969.00 - 2970.44] P:1676.78 E:0.104666 |  Got to concentrate now, Arsenal.
[2970.44 - 2971.84] P:1694.24 E:0.100569 |  Last second to the first half,
[2971.84 - 2974.48] P:1805.08 E:0.098149 |  this is where the fans can make a real difference.
[2974.48 - 2977.96] P:1883.85 E:0.107148 |  Get those noise levels up, make it hard for the Arsenal players
[2978.00 - 2979.08] P:1945.64 E:0.102705 |  to think.
[2979.08 - 2982.60] P:1824.13 E:0.115893 |  Thunder clap begins around the stadium, nil-nil.
[2983.60 - 2984.88] P:1846.60 E:0.124553 |  Pace builds in the clapping,
[2984.88 - 2986.36] P:1759.14 E:0.119169 |  Beringer delivers the corner,
[2986.36 - 2988.56] P:1768.15 E:0.100114 |  near post, headed well wide at the target,
[2988.56 - 2990.00] P:1869.64 E:0.108820 |  and behind for the Arsenal goal kick,
[2990.00 - 2992.88] P:1918.37 E:0.095602 |  and as soon as the ball is back in play, I think,
[2992.88 - 2995.52] P:1856.73 E:0.106333 |  that is going to be the half time whistle.
[2995.52 - 2998.24] P:1921.69 E:0.099523 |  In fact, before David Ryde takes that goal kick,
[2998.24 - 3000.64] P:1788.04 E:0.115155 |  the referee does indeed say, that is it,
[3002.20 - 3003.60] P:1711.82 E:0.117361 |  for this evening so far.
[3003.60 - 3005.88] P:1697.66 E:0.103931 |  Half time in the San Memo Stadium,
[3005.88 - 3008.12] P:1584.76 E:0.103727 |  Paul Robinson, athletic Bill Bowen at Arsenal now.
[3008.12 - 3009.88] P:1625.49 E:0.110956 |  Without having a huge attacking threat,
[3009.88 - 3011.88] P:1580.56 E:0.098879 |  Arsenal have looked comfortable in the first half.
[3011.88 - 3014.68] P:1773.94 E:0.102987 |  I think Bill Bowe had the better of the earlier exchanges,
[3014.68 - 3016.64] P:1771.90 E:0.088216 |  created maybe one or two opportunities,
[3016.64 - 3018.68] P:1691.07 E:0.094888 |  but didn't really trouble David Ryde's goal.
[3018.68 - 3021.12] P:1810.13 E:0.084335 |  Defensively, Arsenal have showed up, they've kept possession.
[3021.12 - 3022.48] P:1736.21 E:0.074012 |  They've looked the...
[3022.48 - 3025.72] P:1722.13 E:0.087132 |  Sorry, athletic, they've looked the inferior opponent at times.
[3025.72 - 3027.48] P:1766.46 E:0.102589 |  Arsenal have looked stronger, they've looked dominant,
[3027.48 - 3028.64] P:1754.33 E:0.093031 |  and when they do look their best,
[3028.64 - 3031.28] P:1707.05 E:0.082988 |  is when they play forward and they play on the front foot.
[3031.28 - 3033.28] P:1705.24 E:0.094991 |  Madiwekey, again, for me, is the biggest threat.
[3033.28 - 3035.52] P:1609.53 E:0.070284 |  Eze needs to stay wider.
[3035.56 - 3037.16] P:1662.75 E:0.112356 |  In Yorker-ez, they've got a willing runner,
[3037.16 - 3038.72] P:1750.44 E:0.078246 |  but not giving him enough service.
[3038.72 - 3040.12] P:1642.03 E:0.096294 |  I think there's more to come from Arsenal.
[3040.12 - 3041.92] P:1651.22 E:0.085035 |  He won't be disappointed with Calarteta.
[3041.92 - 3044.88] P:1744.71 E:0.101423 |  Closest Arsenal have come, the Yorker-ez diving header
[3044.88 - 3046.28] P:1624.85 E:0.098667 |  from the Timber Cross.
[3046.28 - 3048.96] P:1651.43 E:0.103303 |  I'm going to go for intriguing tussle to sum it up.
[3048.96 - 3051.28] P:1523.91 E:0.098309 |  So far, half time, athletic Bill Bowen, nil.
[3051.28 - 3053.04] P:1163.10 E:0.079297 |  Arsenal, nil.
[3053.04 - 3055.60] P:1523.17 E:0.105007 |  I've got to say, Paul, I am amazed that Yorker-ez
[3055.60 - 3057.84] P:1353.11 E:0.093266 |  was able to continue after that knock,
[3057.84 - 3060.16] P:1665.27 E:0.082085 |  because it looked awful, didn't it?
[3060.16 - 3062.36] P:1631.69 E:0.100492 |  It didn't look great, and we're obviously sat right at the back
[3062.36 - 3064.64] P:1460.41 E:0.090105 |  at the stand here, at the very, very back.
[3064.68 - 3067.08] P:1700.45 E:0.102711 |  The top tier looking down, so the incident in itself
[3067.08 - 3068.28] P:1460.66 E:0.074579 |  looked bad enough.
[3068.28 - 3070.00] P:1624.00 E:0.105913 |  We've got a couple of replays on the small monitor,
[3070.00 - 3072.20] P:1677.87 E:0.088618 |  but obviously you've seen it closer up on the TV.
[3072.20 - 3074.28] P:1756.98 E:0.105212 |  We could just see the blood streaming down the side of his head.
[3074.28 - 3075.72] P:1549.53 E:0.083966 |  He went off the side of the pitch
[3075.72 - 3078.72] P:1609.26 E:0.094692 |  after a lot of treatment on the pitch, heavily bandaged.
[3078.72 - 3079.88] P:1843.39 E:0.107068 |  Stood on the near-touchline.
[3079.88 - 3081.40] P:1551.66 E:0.100490 |  He walked around halfway around the pitch,
[3081.40 - 3083.28] P:1654.70 E:0.081688 |  stood on the near-touchline in front of the dugout,
[3083.28 - 3085.04] P:1574.59 E:0.099803 |  and then was allowed to come back onto the pitch.
[3085.04 - 3087.84] P:1608.29 E:0.092673 |  And in all honesty, he didn't look himself.
[3087.84 - 3090.08] P:1695.30 E:0.089989 |  I mean, he looked bright, he looked sharp to start with,
[3090.08 - 3091.20] P:1529.99 E:0.100947 |  but since that knock on the head,
[3091.20 - 3092.40] P:1554.75 E:0.097557 |  there was a couple of times where I thought,
[3092.40 - 3093.44] P:1567.71 E:0.101036 |  you know, is he going to run through,
[3093.44 - 3095.20] P:1614.11 E:0.087437 |  and he kind of held his run.
[3095.20 - 3096.44] P:1630.68 E:0.096743 |  It looked like a heavy one.
[3097.44 - 3099.40] P:1517.05 E:0.101019 |  On Ezzer as well, it just got me thinking
[3099.40 - 3102.20] P:1333.04 E:0.090439 |  when I was listening to you there, wrapping up at half-time.
[3102.20 - 3106.40] P:1461.12 E:0.095955 |  In Martinelli, Arsenal have a player who wants to stay wide.
[3106.40 - 3107.68] P:1332.28 E:0.121320 |  Ezzer doesn't want to do that,
[3107.68 - 3109.60] P:1402.55 E:0.095267 |  does he? He wants to come back inside.
[3109.60 - 3112.20] P:1463.73 E:0.097980 |  So do you think Arsenal can find a way
[3112.20 - 3114.08] P:1380.99 E:0.094119 |  to make that work in the second half,
[3114.08 - 3117.56] P:1386.91 E:0.093060 |  or because it's a more natural fit in an Arteza system,
[3117.56 - 3119.20] P:1367.97 E:0.106891 |  does Ezzer need to change?
[3119.20 - 3121.12] P:1332.29 E:0.105261 |  No, I think he likes that because of the defensive way
[3121.12 - 3122.00] P:1207.30 E:0.108946 |  that Ezzer plays as well.
[3122.00 - 3124.24] P:1550.69 E:0.100113 |  He tooks in and it allows him to tuck in
[3124.24 - 3125.96] P:1532.69 E:0.098080 |  and drop in in the defensive shape.
[3125.96 - 3128.00] P:1535.31 E:0.101351 |  But all their threat has come from Adelwecki
[3128.00 - 3129.24] P:1518.46 E:0.084401 |  down the right-hand side.
[3129.24 - 3132.24] P:1508.11 E:0.099613 |  And naturally, when that happens, the whole team shift,
[3132.24 - 3133.36] P:1564.26 E:0.105613 |  and Ezzer at the edge of that team,
[3133.36 - 3135.24] P:1605.35 E:0.090325 |  he's naturally going to shift and tuck in,
[3135.24 - 3137.36] P:1496.68 E:0.106757 |  but actually in possession, they'll be better off doing,
[3137.36 - 3139.56] P:1590.61 E:0.099825 |  like what England did in midweek against Serbia,
[3139.56 - 3141.24] P:1637.62 E:0.103285 |  split and making the pitch really wide,
[3141.24 - 3144.28] P:1667.15 E:0.097024 |  get the wide players literally as wide as they possibly can.
[3144.28 - 3146.08] P:1610.22 E:0.090931 |  And that's where the threat's been for Arsenal.
[3146.08 - 3147.76] P:1750.04 E:0.109216 |  But for me, Ezzer is one, not done enough,
[3147.76 - 3149.60] P:1766.70 E:0.089727 |  and two, he just tracks inside all the time.
[3149.64 - 3151.20] P:1778.23 E:0.106518 |  He needs to find himself more space
[3151.20 - 3152.72] P:1563.64 E:0.074718 |  and get involved in the game.
[3152.72 - 3154.72] P:1669.51 E:0.102203 |  All right, you two, thank you very much for the time being.
[3154.72 - 3157.44] P:1576.60 E:0.090076 |  So, Athletic Club, nil, Arsenal, nil.
[3157.44 - 3159.04] P:1518.96 E:0.094415 |  I knew I was going to say that.
[3159.04 - 3160.96] P:1689.94 E:0.089672 |  As soon as I started saying, should we say,
[3160.96 - 3161.88] P:1909.89 E:0.078271 |  Athleticville bow?
[3161.88 - 3164.40] P:1863.34 E:0.081059 |  Anyway, it's goalless inside San Mames.
[3164.40 - 3167.12] P:2034.17 E:0.080398 |  We've got two Champions League commentaries for you tonight
[3167.12 - 3168.00] P:1830.35 E:0.102115 |  on Five Lives.
[3168.00 - 3169.72] P:1930.77 E:0.097716 |  So, coming up shortly, we'll make our first trip
[3169.72 - 3171.52] P:1859.98 E:0.086519 |  of the night to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
[3171.52 - 3175.24] P:1904.80 E:0.081619 |  Spurs VRAL in full on Five Lives and BBC Sounds
[3175.24 - 3177.24] P:1726.16 E:0.080410 |  at eight o'clock this evening.
[3177.24 - 3180.56] P:1743.87 E:0.092118 |  We'll also get you round the three league cup ties tonight as well.
[3180.56 - 3184.44] P:1894.94 E:0.065284 |  We're at Brentford, Crystal Palace, and Sheffield Wednesday.
[3184.44 - 3185.96] P:1525.22 E:0.104478 |  And we've got more coming as well
[3185.96 - 3188.36] P:2022.89 E:0.071321 |  from the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.
[3188.36 - 3190.80] P:1795.86 E:0.086735 |  So, we'll do all of that before second half commentary
[3190.80 - 3192.92] P:1490.59 E:0.060407 |  after the news on Five Lives with Bethan Holmes.
[3192.92 - 3194.48] P:1497.43 E:0.129077 |  The Voice of the UK.
[3194.48 - 3197.68] P:1406.14 E:0.101234 |  This is BBC Radio Five Live.
[3197.68 - 3200.40] P:970.99 E:0.093783 |  Thousands of people are attempting to flee Gaza City
[3200.40 - 3203.36] P:1615.83 E:0.091526 |  as the IDF launches a major ground offensive there.
[3203.36 - 3205.68] P:1712.35 E:0.083872 |  Israel claims it's a Hamas stronghold.
[3205.68 - 3209.20] P:1331.92 E:0.104742 |  That coincides with a finding by a UN commissioner of inquiry
[3209.20 - 3212.20] P:1720.02 E:0.092281 |  that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza.
[3212.20 - 3215.08] P:1361.94 E:0.082083 |  The report found four out of the five genocidal acts
[3215.08 - 3217.88] P:1740.33 E:0.076316 |  have been carried out, which Israel rejects.
[3217.88 - 3220.56] P:1184.28 E:0.083876 |  Our diplomatic correspondent is Caroline Hawley.
[3220.56 - 3223.96] P:1498.24 E:0.091759 |  The UN Secretary-General has just said that it's not for him
[3223.96 - 3226.80] P:1553.80 E:0.076269 |  to determine legally if it's genocide,
[3226.80 - 3228.88] P:1524.18 E:0.090441 |  but he said the situation is horrendous
[3228.88 - 3232.56] P:1512.83 E:0.077374 |  and he said he couldn't remember such massive killing of civilians
[3232.56 - 3234.56] P:1567.99 E:0.068527 |  during the time he's done his job.
[3234.56 - 3238.00] P:1466.28 E:0.093963 |  So, I think this report will certainly add to the mounting condemnation
[3238.00 - 3240.80] P:1652.78 E:0.084977 |  of what Israel is doing in capitals right around the world,
[3240.80 - 3244.08] P:1652.70 E:0.069925 |  including many of Israel's Western allies.
[3244.08 - 3246.64] P:1228.30 E:0.105270 |  Elsewhere this evening, some of Hollywood's biggest names
[3246.64 - 3250.28] P:1761.85 E:0.082857 |  are paying tribute to Robert Redford, who's died at the age of 89.
[3250.28 - 3252.84] P:1325.46 E:0.096580 |  His co-star in Barefoot in the Park, James Fonda,
[3252.84 - 3255.40] P:1627.62 E:0.086768 |  says he was a beautiful person in every way.
[3255.40 - 3257.96] P:1273.73 E:0.070864 |  Here's our entertainment correspondent, Colin Patterson.
[3257.96 - 3259.68] P:1795.39 E:0.087222 |  When you look back at his career,
[3259.68 - 3263.36] P:1778.45 E:0.086656 |  it is that spell in the 1970s
[3263.36 - 3268.08] P:1809.52 E:0.083148 |  when he was the biggest movie star on the planet.
[3268.08 - 3271.36] P:2035.09 E:0.093705 |  He became the first person since Bing Crosby
[3271.36 - 3275.36] P:1803.86 E:0.084481 |  to have three films of his own in the top ten
[3275.36 - 3278.32] P:1641.88 E:0.097878 |  at the end of the year in 1974.
[3278.32 - 3280.24] P:1759.86 E:0.061745 |  What a movie star he was.
[3280.24 - 3282.20] P:1435.79 E:0.093856 |  Donald Trump is on his way to the UK.
[3282.20 - 3286.12] P:1590.31 E:0.081274 |  He's the first US president to be invited for a second state visit.
[3286.12 - 3288.84] P:1245.33 E:0.098750 |  The US president will spend tomorrow at Windsor Castle
[3288.84 - 3290.00] P:1613.52 E:0.077192 |  with the king and queen,
[3290.00 - 3292.24] P:1451.50 E:0.087659 |  and on Thursday he'll travel to the prime minister's
[3292.24 - 3294.04] P:1860.70 E:0.074700 |  country residence, Checkers.
[3294.04 - 3297.20] P:1658.21 E:0.086707 |  And as part of his visit, Mr Trump will be speaking about trade.
[3297.20 - 3300.16] P:1219.18 E:0.093429 |  But we now understand an expected deal to scrap tariffs
[3300.16 - 3304.84] P:1569.03 E:0.069509 |  on UK steel exports to the US has been put on hold indefinitely.
[3304.84 - 3307.80] P:1767.65 E:0.082507 |  British steel faces a 25% duty,
[3307.80 - 3310.24] P:1739.24 E:0.078507 |  which is half the rate put on other countries.
[3310.24 - 3313.36] P:1765.56 E:0.080139 |  Senior government sources say the UK steel industry
[3313.36 - 3315.64] P:1853.89 E:0.063426 |  still has a competitive edge.
[3316.36 - 3318.56] P:1264.98 E:0.114316 |  Well, let's have a look at the travel here, Zawna.
[3318.56 - 3319.56] P:1168.10 E:0.094170 |  Thanks, Beth Ann.
[3319.56 - 3321.72] P:1364.20 E:0.104954 |  So if we look at Cumbria first with the M6
[3321.72 - 3324.28] P:1654.63 E:0.098672 |  and if you're heading north, T-bay at junction 38,
[3324.28 - 3326.04] P:1051.67 E:0.110693 |  that's where the motorway was closed this morning.
[3326.04 - 3328.04] P:1426.48 E:0.104709 |  Two lanes are still closed at the scene there.
[3328.04 - 3329.96] P:1541.99 E:0.100366 |  It's looking slow on the approach as well.
[3329.96 - 3332.64] P:1451.61 E:0.103031 |  The A56 in Lancashire heading north
[3332.64 - 3335.12] P:1592.49 E:0.097901 |  and approaching the M66 junction once.
[3335.12 - 3336.48] P:1374.60 E:0.110127 |  So that's the rum spot in junction.
[3336.48 - 3338.16] P:1177.68 E:0.102664 |  It's where it joins the A56
[3338.16 - 3340.64] P:1186.21 E:0.106250 |  and it becomes that new route there heading north
[3340.64 - 3343.24] P:1416.90 E:0.100302 |  and heading towards the Burnley turnoff at Rottenstall.
[3343.24 - 3345.64] P:1363.90 E:0.089438 |  You've got it all blocked off to deal with an accident there.
[3345.64 - 3348.60] P:1359.17 E:0.111091 |  M5 Bristol Q's long delays Northman junction 15
[3348.60 - 3349.76] P:1136.99 E:0.100239 |  joining the M4.
[3349.76 - 3351.52] P:1214.32 E:0.094116 |  That said, Almond's free with the Q's backing up
[3351.52 - 3353.32] P:1252.51 E:0.105223 |  to Cripps causeway junction 17.
[3353.32 - 3355.48] P:1537.59 E:0.093869 |  One lane still closed at the scene of the accident.
[3355.48 - 3358.68] P:998.57 E:0.108202 |  M25 looking slow along the bottom at 7 near the M23
[3358.68 - 3359.72] P:1800.32 E:0.093505 |  at the interchange.
[3359.72 - 3361.20] P:1106.03 E:0.099087 |  One lane closed for the repairs,
[3361.20 - 3362.88] P:1637.31 E:0.097438 |  queuing that to 8 at Rygate.
[3362.88 - 3366.08] P:1244.91 E:0.094086 |  And the M27 westbound junction 12 at Portsmouth.
[3366.08 - 3368.12] P:1276.74 E:0.110487 |  The scene of the accident still looking busy there.
[3368.12 - 3370.88] P:1364.15 E:0.097044 |  Q's backing up onto the A27 haven't bypassed
[3370.88 - 3372.60] P:1535.74 E:0.106817 |  and on the trains, no service.
[3372.60 - 3375.04] P:1313.46 E:0.095145 |  Operating between rugby and Coventry
[3375.08 - 3378.20] P:1049.40 E:0.102110 |  are neither Avanti West Coast or London Northwestern.
[3378.20 - 3379.96] P:1199.49 E:0.082123 |  On a merchant, five life travel.

[3395.48 - 3397.84] P:1899.53 E:0.127860 |  Let's just go up and shift away and make a difference.
[3397.84 - 3401.00] P:1371.30 E:0.125344 |  Whatever the day throws at you will help make sense of it.

[3422.84 - 3426.96] P:1871.32 E:0.085668 |  It is the first Champions League night of the season proper
[3426.96 - 3429.12] P:1772.44 E:0.095710 |  on Five Live and BBC Sound.
[3429.12 - 3433.16] P:1819.40 E:0.084189 |  Athletic Bill Bown Nill, Arsenal Nill at half time.
[3433.20 - 3435.36] P:1928.75 E:0.096239 |  Whilst you're listening, you can follow on with the conversation
[3435.36 - 3437.68] P:1840.38 E:0.083874 |  on the BBC Sport website as well.

[3443.32 - 3445.12] P:1964.56 E:0.063919 |  is how you do it.
[3445.12 - 3446.84] P:2020.15 E:0.084611 |  Right now on the live text page,
[3446.84 - 3450.64] P:1804.94 E:0.081317 |  I've just seen that the review of the first half is Nill Nill.
[3450.64 - 3452.64] P:1978.27 E:0.066098 |  I'll be honest, not a great watch.
[3452.64 - 3454.08] P:1780.81 E:0.090320 |  Which I think sums it up quite well.
[3454.08 - 3455.72] P:1944.33 E:0.076745 |  So if you head over to the BBC Sport website,
[3455.72 - 3457.04] P:1865.49 E:0.069824 |  you can follow with that.
[3457.04 - 3460.44] P:1812.99 E:0.084948 |  Full commentary to come as well on Spurs versus VRAL at 8.
[3460.44 - 3462.88] P:1958.09 E:0.073503 |  So we'll be inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
[3462.92 - 3466.24] P:1919.44 E:0.092190 |  Shortly, three games in the third round of the league cup tonight.
[3466.24 - 3469.60] P:1801.80 E:0.087588 |  Aston Villa, still looking for their first goal of the season
[3469.60 - 3472.80] P:1936.49 E:0.083017 |  who are at Brentford, who've scored in all five of their games so far.
[3472.80 - 3473.72] P:1816.08 E:0.053988 |  Chris Wise.
[3473.72 - 3475.12] P:2222.73 E:0.094358 |  And strangely, despite that,
[3475.12 - 3477.16] P:2128.68 E:0.082684 |  Villa have actually had more shots than Brentford
[3477.16 - 3478.44] P:1938.12 E:0.078472 |  in the Premier League this season.
[3478.44 - 3480.56] P:2114.15 E:0.102363 |  Second meeting in less than a month for these two as well.
[3480.56 - 3483.64] P:2236.07 E:0.083502 |  Brentford's one-nil win here was Keith Andrews' first victory
[3483.64 - 3485.28] P:2278.53 E:0.058844 |  since taking charge.
[3485.28 - 3489.72] P:2218.06 E:0.086001 |  But clearly, the inquisitive eyes are going to be on Unai Emery's team
[3489.72 - 3493.56] P:2300.22 E:0.081911 |  a sense that he might need to go strong in his team selection tonight,
[3493.56 - 3495.52] P:2215.07 E:0.077084 |  given their troubles in front of goal.
[3495.52 - 3499.00] P:2097.21 E:0.080980 |  Interestingly, Emery's actually only won one league cup game
[3499.00 - 3502.28] P:2084.31 E:0.072757 |  since his appointment just under three years ago at Villa.
[3502.28 - 3503.64] P:2266.34 E:0.099632 |  We're going to get the team news very shortly
[3503.64 - 3506.52] P:2084.08 E:0.079274 |  and we'll find out if we're going to see Jadon Sancho for the first time
[3506.52 - 3507.76] P:2067.18 E:0.040027 |  in a Villa shirt.
[3507.76 - 3509.92] P:1740.93 E:0.088744 |  That one's an eight o'clock kickoff and so is this one.
[3509.92 - 3512.84] P:1778.61 E:0.096310 |  Crystal Palace, of course, the FA Cup and Community Shield winners.
[3512.84 - 3516.36] P:1931.09 E:0.089546 |  They face Millwall, who last went beyond the third round of the league cup
[3516.36 - 3517.88] P:1934.51 E:0.109072 |  in 1995.
[3517.88 - 3519.32] P:1649.18 E:0.061026 |  Aaron Paul's at Selhurst.
[3519.32 - 3521.64] P:2070.51 E:0.092201 |  Yeah, and this one, Steve, needs no real introduction,
[3521.64 - 3524.60] P:1841.36 E:0.099147 |  does it with the last competitive meeting between Palace and Millwall,
[3524.60 - 3527.00] P:1855.47 E:0.099124 |  reigniting the vitriol in South London.
[3527.00 - 3530.12] P:1892.69 E:0.094038 |  Things have mellowed since both have their own individual focuses,
[3530.12 - 3533.04] P:1885.03 E:0.092711 |  but tonight's tyre first between the two in the EFL cup
[3533.04 - 3536.56] P:1899.17 E:0.081770 |  will no doubt be contested in a white hot heat atmosphere.
[3536.56 - 3538.20] P:1911.61 E:0.103537 |  The team news is yet to be released.
[3538.20 - 3541.00] P:1752.39 E:0.097065 |  We understand Walter Benitez will start in goal for Palace
[3541.00 - 3544.28] P:1934.29 E:0.087879 |  with Saar Walton and Anketia all expected to miss out.
[3544.28 - 3547.72] P:1931.40 E:0.086369 |  Millwall's scraped a draw down the road at Charlton on Saturday.
[3547.80 - 3551.16] P:1753.94 E:0.100301 |  Alex Neil will demand a better showing from his side who were poor.
[3551.16 - 3553.64] P:1927.09 E:0.081487 |  We go at eight o'clock under the lights at Selhurst.
[3553.64 - 3555.44] P:1823.25 E:0.087778 |  There's a 745 game as well.
[3555.44 - 3557.60] P:1872.49 E:0.096561 |  League two Grimsby town, you will remember,
[3557.60 - 3560.64] P:2121.24 E:0.082219 |  stunned Manchester United in the last round.
[3560.64 - 3562.84] P:2133.23 E:0.093169 |  So what can they do against championship struggle
[3562.84 - 3565.64] P:1970.82 E:0.074873 |  as Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough, Julia Boldt?
[3565.64 - 3567.96] P:1904.74 E:0.084632 |  Sheffield at Wednesday might be in crisis,
[3567.96 - 3572.36] P:1906.09 E:0.082416 |  but their own win over leads on penalties to reach this third round match.
[3572.36 - 3575.60] P:1785.94 E:0.085942 |  Did put some much needed positivity into the club.
[3575.60 - 3579.40] P:1945.23 E:0.085303 |  However, it is fair to say it's chaos behind the scenes here
[3579.40 - 3582.96] P:2019.93 E:0.079729 |  with some wages on paid, second from bottom in the championship
[3582.96 - 3584.60] P:1784.76 E:0.089724 |  and a transfer embargo.
[3584.60 - 3588.72] P:1961.31 E:0.071818 |  So again, the fans will protest against the ownership tonight
[3588.72 - 3591.60] P:1952.52 E:0.081616 |  with the majority of them boycotting the game.
[3591.60 - 3595.48] P:1943.31 E:0.078296 |  It means we'll have just 2000 home supporters here
[3595.48 - 3599.04] P:1890.02 E:0.074900 |  compared to around 5000 Grimsby fans.
[3599.04 - 3600.52] P:1826.44 E:0.096925 |  We do have the team news here now.
[3600.52 - 3603.48] P:1897.96 E:0.093429 |  Nine changes to the side that lost here at Hillsborough
[3603.52 - 3605.88] P:1940.41 E:0.068053 |  against Bristol City on Saturday.
[3605.88 - 3607.88] P:1943.06 E:0.094946 |  But after beating Manchester United,
[3607.88 - 3610.92] P:1876.30 E:0.079758 |  the visitors are brimming with confidence.
[3610.92 - 3612.68] P:2135.49 E:0.087364 |  It is two changes for them tonight,
[3612.68 - 3617.12] P:1952.23 E:0.075341 |  Rhys Staunton and Justin Amalzor, both come into the midfield.
[3617.12 - 3618.12] P:2097.31 E:0.101162 |  Thank you very much, Julia.
[3618.12 - 3619.68] P:1915.39 E:0.095121 |  So we'll be back in Bilbao shortly.
[3619.68 - 3621.84] P:1516.72 E:0.094458 |  Athletic Bilbao Nill, Arsenal Nill,
[3621.84 - 3623.76] P:1958.60 E:0.095072 |  half time in the Champions League.
[3623.76 - 3628.20] P:1926.53 E:0.093015 |  Then our second commentary of the evening is Spurs versus VRAL.
[3628.20 - 3630.04] P:1625.61 E:0.086756 |  Chris Sutton's at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
[3630.04 - 3631.84] P:1667.60 E:0.074576 |  It's an eight o'clock kickoff evening, Chris.
[3631.84 - 3632.60] P:1897.05 E:0.049282 |  Hello, Steve.
[3632.64 - 3635.12] P:1599.73 E:0.098713 |  Let's hope Conor McNamara's train hurries up.
[3635.12 - 3636.92] P:1326.12 E:0.088193 |  Otherwise, you'll be commentating as well.
[3636.92 - 3639.72] P:1324.88 E:0.082349 |  Well, yeah, that won't be a good listen.
[3639.72 - 3641.16] P:1657.76 E:0.109340 |  I don't think it'll be great.
[3641.16 - 3642.92] P:1906.95 E:0.079025 |  So let's pray for Conor.
[3642.92 - 3644.52] P:2014.57 E:0.066153 |  Yes, just get it, Conor.
[3644.52 - 3646.88] P:1807.43 E:0.080837 |  However you do it, trains, planes, automobiles.
[3646.88 - 3649.36] P:1889.27 E:0.069613 |  Just get to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, please.
[3649.36 - 3650.36] P:1885.09 E:0.109870 |  There's a lot going on.
[3650.36 - 3652.28] P:1989.36 E:0.086366 |  Not only is it Spurs' first Champions League
[3652.28 - 3653.56] P:1889.11 E:0.089461 |  much in two and a half years,
[3653.56 - 3655.32] P:1852.78 E:0.081294 |  it's the first full stop for Thomas Frank.
[3655.32 - 3657.80] P:1920.67 E:0.099020 |  It's the first since the end of the Daniel Levy era.
[3657.80 - 3659.24] P:1744.72 E:0.075622 |  There's a lot going on, basically.
[3659.24 - 3661.72] P:1868.30 E:0.097993 |  Yeah, and Justin is programme notes.
[3661.72 - 3664.52] P:1731.15 E:0.082780 |  Thomas Frank has talked about great pride
[3664.52 - 3667.56] P:1806.58 E:0.088153 |  in being a coach in the Champions League.
[3667.56 - 3669.24] P:1817.98 E:0.077078 |  First time, you're quite right.
[3669.24 - 3672.08] P:1739.42 E:0.086688 |  And just the importance of Tottenham
[3672.08 - 3674.40] P:1835.34 E:0.078256 |  getting off to a flying start.
[3674.40 - 3676.00] P:1644.50 E:0.093225 |  You get that first win on the board
[3676.00 - 3680.52] P:1845.81 E:0.071581 |  that gives them a real opportunity to build on that.
[3680.52 - 3683.80] P:2048.61 E:0.085484 |  It's been pretty seamless, really,
[3683.80 - 3685.36] P:1757.04 E:0.083955 |  the takeover from Thomas Frank.
[3685.36 - 3688.40] P:1919.94 E:0.065733 |  It's... He's felt, as far as I can see,
[3688.40 - 3693.20] P:1764.28 E:0.081136 |  very comfortable moving across London from Brentford to Tottenham.
[3693.20 - 3695.68] P:1793.59 E:0.072330 |  They've had a good start in the Premier League.
[3695.68 - 3697.08] P:1616.93 E:0.098705 |  Three wins out of four.
[3697.08 - 3700.56] P:1964.27 E:0.082430 |  And he's a manager, horses for courses, isn't he?
[3700.56 - 3702.92] P:1945.34 E:0.096303 |  He's adaptable, he will change up,
[3702.92 - 3706.32] P:1951.58 E:0.083503 |  as we saw in the Super Cup final against PSG,
[3706.32 - 3708.56] P:1822.85 E:0.086533 |  where they nearly got over the line,
[3708.56 - 3709.92] P:1703.51 E:0.090380 |  actually played very well in that.
[3709.92 - 3712.28] P:2030.64 E:0.073866 |  So it'll be interesting to see how he sets up,
[3712.28 - 3715.24] P:1552.05 E:0.083066 |  but they're up against a difficult opponent in Villarreal,
[3715.24 - 3718.24] P:1802.14 E:0.078778 |  who didn't have European football last season,
[3718.24 - 3722.60] P:1740.70 E:0.084989 |  but we know they're sort of pedigree in Europe over the years.
[3722.60 - 3725.04] P:1884.66 E:0.064661 |  You know, they can take a scalp or two.
[3725.04 - 3728.84] P:1899.63 E:0.081813 |  So, have you been impressed, then, with how they've looked?
[3728.84 - 3730.64] P:1771.57 E:0.072976 |  Because, like you said, they have got off to a good start,
[3730.64 - 3733.84] P:1826.01 E:0.082227 |  and results have been all right so far, certainly good.
[3733.84 - 3737.16] P:1544.86 E:0.057902 |  So, stylistically, are they more fun?
[3737.16 - 3740.48] P:1809.17 E:0.083470 |  I don't know whether they're more fun.
[3740.48 - 3743.68] P:1545.50 E:0.089516 |  I think that there was quite a ride under Angi Posta-Cogli,
[3743.68 - 3745.08] P:1796.26 E:0.106365 |  wasn't it, in last season?
[3745.08 - 3746.64] P:1698.27 E:0.086619 |  You know, the Premier League form wasn't good,
[3746.68 - 3748.96] P:1874.46 E:0.070454 |  but they ended up winning the Europa League.
[3748.96 - 3750.92] P:1733.77 E:0.087163 |  And Angi Posta-Cogli at the end of the season
[3750.92 - 3753.00] P:1713.33 E:0.097733 |  put all those eggs in the Europa League basket,
[3753.00 - 3754.16] P:1616.98 E:0.085502 |  ended up winning a trophy.
[3754.16 - 3756.48] P:1904.85 E:0.068568 |  Tottenham don't win trophies.
[3756.48 - 3759.20] P:1843.48 E:0.092273 |  There just seems to be an air of calmness,
[3759.20 - 3760.92] P:1809.11 E:0.077555 |  more calmness around the club.
[3760.92 - 3762.84] P:1658.79 E:0.091219 |  It's early days, as of yet,
[3762.84 - 3766.72] P:1816.83 E:0.080584 |  but you look at the result at the weekend against West Ham.
[3766.72 - 3769.28] P:1829.59 E:0.081916 |  You know, I think it was their first win in six years,
[3769.28 - 3770.28] P:1649.49 E:0.082885 |  something like that.
[3770.28 - 3772.68] P:1926.53 E:0.060973 |  It was extremely comfortable.
[3772.68 - 3775.64] P:1588.33 E:0.096951 |  And I've just seen Conor McNamara arriving.
[3775.68 - 3777.64] P:1856.70 E:0.099416 |  We don't need him, Chris. We're having a good time, aren't we?
[3777.64 - 3779.08] P:1628.06 E:0.053576 |  That's cheered me up, yeah.
[3779.08 - 3780.44] P:1914.54 E:0.084873 |  What do you mean, cheered you up?
[3780.44 - 3781.96] P:1580.97 E:0.082423 |  Yeah, well, that's cheered me up.
[3781.96 - 3784.92] P:1337.41 E:0.087868 |  You wouldn't want to listen to me all evening, Steve, on my own.
[3784.92 - 3787.24] P:1858.63 E:0.071465 |  But no, but just going back to Tottenham,
[3787.24 - 3791.44] P:1792.18 E:0.081612 |  it's been a really good start for Thomas Frank,
[3791.44 - 3794.56] P:1833.34 E:0.069307 |  and it would be even better if they could get a win tonight.
[3794.56 - 3797.96] P:1913.03 E:0.065358 |  I actually think the fixtures they've got in the Champions League
[3797.96 - 3799.44] P:1811.27 E:0.089933 |  are pretty OK.
[3800.40 - 3801.84] P:1920.96 E:0.098044 |  This is the one, isn't it,
[3801.84 - 3805.88] P:1855.98 E:0.065727 |  which on paper feels like a big night, if you like?
[3805.88 - 3809.48] P:1631.96 E:0.095081 |  Well, it is, because it's about getting a foothold, isn't it?
[3809.48 - 3812.00] P:1654.23 E:0.094502 |  Getting three points on the board, I don't know how many it'll be,
[3812.00 - 3815.44] P:1621.38 E:0.094101 |  to qualify, 10-11, whatever it is, but it gives them a great chance.
[3815.44 - 3818.08] P:1709.11 E:0.094479 |  I think they've got home games against Copenhagen,
[3818.08 - 3819.72] P:1904.89 E:0.070793 |  Slevear, Proud to come,
[3819.72 - 3823.84] P:1941.50 E:0.080688 |  games which you would expect Tottenham to have too much quality
[3823.84 - 3824.80] P:2093.30 E:0.072450 |  for those two teams.
[3824.80 - 3829.16] P:1851.81 E:0.077482 |  So, you know, an enormous game tonight for Thomas Frank,
[3829.16 - 3831.28] P:1822.18 E:0.049295 |  and, you know, first time in the Champions League.
[3831.32 - 3834.20] P:1859.11 E:0.092515 |  Also, Mike got a first sight of Randall Colomawani,
[3834.20 - 3836.68] P:1692.06 E:0.045444 |  who's quite an exciting signing, isn't he?
[3836.68 - 3840.44] P:1874.94 E:0.095721 |  I think he is, and he has plenty of Champions League experience
[3840.44 - 3844.44] P:1851.28 E:0.081857 |  with his previous clubs, Frankfurt and PSG and Juventus,
[3844.44 - 3847.48] P:1828.69 E:0.081193 |  I think 23 appearances in the Champions League.
[3847.48 - 3850.16] P:1801.28 E:0.098831 |  Tottenham have strength in depth, don't they, in those forward areas?
[3850.16 - 3855.48] P:1792.16 E:0.071987 |  I know Solanke doesn't look like he's fit this evening,
[3855.48 - 3857.48] P:1766.41 E:0.086541 |  but no, they have real strength in depth.
[3857.48 - 3859.04] P:1797.75 E:0.086155 |  You look at the bench at the weekend,
[3859.08 - 3861.36] P:1934.14 E:0.078714 |  you know, some of the players on the bench, Johnson,
[3861.36 - 3865.36] P:1648.61 E:0.086281 |  Audubair, you know, on the Colomawani, on there as well.
[3865.36 - 3867.28] P:1881.34 E:0.081338 |  So, you think Richardleisson, I don't know,
[3867.28 - 3869.76] P:1740.92 E:0.091462 |  they'll start this evening, I think the teams are out.
[3871.12 - 3872.40] P:1696.01 E:0.081320 |  But John, can I have a look at the teams?
[3872.40 - 3874.12] P:2060.49 E:0.090247 |  John, I'll just do Conor's job here.
[3874.12 - 3876.04] P:1542.43 E:0.110639 |  Go on, I mean, you're doing very well so far.
[3876.04 - 3878.32] P:1875.39 E:0.063267 |  Yeah, just doing Conor's job.
[3878.32 - 3882.56] P:1830.24 E:0.082830 |  So, yeah, well, Richardleisson starts tonight.
[3882.56 - 3885.84] P:1969.90 E:0.075470 |  So, Kudas, I can't see Colomawani though,
[3885.84 - 3888.72] P:1882.95 E:0.061747 |  so he must be on the bench then.
[3889.68 - 3891.68] P:2127.00 E:0.102151 |  Just John's just scrolling, he's on the bench,
[3891.68 - 3892.72] P:1896.06 E:0.108559 |  so a little bit disappointing.
[3892.72 - 3895.36] P:1710.59 E:0.080026 |  We built him up there and he's on the bench,
[3895.36 - 3898.00] P:1870.39 E:0.065978 |  but I'm sure he'll get some minutes.
[3898.00 - 3900.76] P:1679.93 E:0.073265 |  I think you're right, Chris, we need Conor back, don't we?
[3900.76 - 3902.08] P:1898.34 E:0.107804 |  Here he is.
[3902.08 - 3903.60] P:1904.84 E:0.104719 |  Here he is, just saying hello.
[3903.60 - 3904.44] P:1692.32 E:0.084968 |  Thank God.
[3904.44 - 3906.40] P:1731.48 E:0.085668 |  Good, listen, well done,
[3906.40 - 3907.68] P:1678.25 E:0.093134 |  because it sounds like you've had a nightmare,
[3907.68 - 3908.52] P:1240.30 E:0.112447 |  so well played.
[3908.52 - 3909.36] P:1811.78 E:0.073692 |  All good, all good.
[3909.36 - 3910.20] P:1848.61 E:0.021090 |  Excellent.
[3910.20 - 3911.84] P:1729.60 E:0.098094 |  Right, fine, well, we've run out of time now, Conor,
[3911.84 - 3912.96] P:1467.36 E:0.096302 |  but it's lovely to hear your voice.
[3912.96 - 3913.80] P:1507.22 E:0.106047 |  No problem.
[3913.80 - 3914.64] P:1796.49 E:0.092822 |  Chris has done a great job.
[3914.64 - 3915.48] P:1699.22 E:0.058433 |  Do you have the teams?
[3915.48 - 3917.60] P:1902.84 E:0.076589 |  Yeah, go on, if you've got a couple headlines.
[3917.60 - 3919.52] P:2093.35 E:0.095137 |  Two changes for Spurs,
[3919.52 - 3922.40] P:1898.80 E:0.080148 |  because Bentoncourt comes into the midfield
[3922.40 - 3923.96] P:1976.77 E:0.086506 |  and Rashardlison comes into the attack
[3923.96 - 3925.92] P:1534.57 E:0.075209 |  and they replace Joe Pelina and Matias Tell.
[3925.92 - 3926.80] P:1734.85 E:0.067579 |  What professionals?
[3926.80 - 3927.92] P:1977.99 E:0.110698 |  Thank you very much, U2.
[3927.92 - 3929.72] P:1800.79 E:0.093120 |  We're ready to go in Bill Bow, Ali.
[3930.68 - 3931.52] P:1951.77 E:0.106283 |  Thank you, Steve.
[3931.52 - 3933.60] P:1646.04 E:0.091083 |  Welcome back to the San Mamès Stadium.
[3933.60 - 3935.16] P:1570.19 E:0.084675 |  Listening to the dulcet tones of Chris Sutton
[3935.16 - 3938.28] P:1803.55 E:0.097936 |  just reminds me I was recording the FPL podcast
[3938.28 - 3940.40] P:1790.67 E:0.106541 |  from BBC Sport earlier on today with him.
[3940.40 - 3941.92] P:1855.42 E:0.091160 |  If you're a fantasy football fan,
[3941.92 - 3942.92] P:1760.88 E:0.111210 |  get your ears around that.
[3942.92 - 3944.20] P:1818.19 E:0.101161 |  It comes out every Wednesday.
[3944.20 - 3947.56] P:1820.27 E:0.094744 |  Chris and his team actually go in really well this season,
[3947.60 - 3948.56] P:1533.36 E:0.107104 |  no most seller in it,
[3948.56 - 3949.76] P:1640.82 E:0.099118 |  but he has got Erling Harland,
[3949.76 - 3952.04] P:1848.43 E:0.086103 |  who's been banging the goals for him.
[3952.04 - 3954.88] P:1601.23 E:0.086148 |  And we are waiting for the second half
[3954.88 - 3957.32] P:1567.91 E:0.098915 |  to get underway here in northern Spain.
[3957.32 - 3959.76] P:1579.42 E:0.107440 |  Halftime, Athletic Bill Bow, Niel Arsenal, Niel.
[3959.76 - 3960.76] P:1643.19 E:0.113307 |  There goes the whistle.
[3960.76 - 3963.88] P:1859.63 E:0.100765 |  Athletic Bill Bow will play from right to left
[3963.88 - 3965.72] P:1712.11 E:0.085294 |  in this second half.
[3965.72 - 3968.04] P:1614.35 E:0.102856 |  Their goalkeeper, Una Simone, is all in orange.
[3968.04 - 3971.44] P:1574.49 E:0.080684 |  The outfield players in the famous red and white stripes.
[3971.44 - 3973.28] P:1581.70 E:0.085722 |  Red panels on the backs with white numbers,
[3973.28 - 3974.72] P:1763.68 E:0.086170 |  black shorts and black socks.
[3974.72 - 3976.68] P:1676.95 E:0.098042 |  That's a shove in the back on Yurka Rez.
[3976.68 - 3978.92] P:1827.77 E:0.098882 |  And Yurka Rez is out there for Arsenal.
[3978.92 - 3980.52] P:1601.42 E:0.102399 |  Paul, we wondered, didn't we?
[3980.52 - 3983.08] P:1685.26 E:0.078414 |  Particularly after that knock he took to the back of the head
[3983.08 - 3984.28] P:1656.52 E:0.102514 |  late in the first half,
[3984.28 - 3985.36] P:1736.83 E:0.096295 |  and then he looked groggy after that,
[3985.36 - 3986.80] P:1455.96 E:0.091069 |  whether he might not return.
[3986.80 - 3988.88] P:1447.46 E:0.090494 |  But he is starting the second half for Arsenal.
[3988.88 - 3991.28] P:1450.72 E:0.093915 |  We did wonder, and I think it would be obviously very difficult
[3991.28 - 3993.92] P:1647.95 E:0.100756 |  to take him off from a manager's point of view as well.
[3994.92 - 3996.48] P:1695.95 E:0.116272 |  That number nine that they've talked about,
[3996.48 - 3998.32] P:1849.41 E:0.094282 |  he's come in, he's had such a good start.
[3998.32 - 3999.72] P:1666.15 E:0.106091 |  Here's Madueke on the right,
[3999.72 - 4002.12] P:1821.06 E:0.103455 |  crosses too close to Una Simone.
[4002.12 - 4004.88] P:1709.71 E:0.095081 |  He was looking for Yurka Rez, not the far post.
[4004.88 - 4006.20] P:1828.92 E:0.110876 |  Yurka Rez was lurking there,
[4006.20 - 4007.52] P:1552.43 E:0.095265 |  but he couldn't find him at the cross.
[4007.52 - 4010.24] P:1651.86 E:0.093845 |  Santheck nearly turns into trouble inside his own half.
[4010.24 - 4013.52] P:1709.03 E:0.097008 |  Good presence of mind and strength on the ball to hold onto it.
[4013.52 - 4017.04] P:1664.66 E:0.094533 |  Robert Navarro plays out to the right-hand side,
[4017.04 - 4020.92] P:1712.71 E:0.101150 |  to the right back, and Doni got a Sarbel.
[4020.92 - 4024.72] P:1769.47 E:0.097662 |  The athletic fans start up with a good old sing song
[4024.72 - 4025.80] P:1621.61 E:0.102553 |  at the start of the second half.
[4025.80 - 4028.04] P:1575.40 E:0.107317 |  Probably worth reminding you as well about this league phase
[4028.04 - 4028.92] P:1615.49 E:0.094733 |  and the Champions League.
[4028.92 - 4031.84] P:1533.92 E:0.095117 |  Second season of it, 36 teams.
[4031.84 - 4035.20] P:1683.67 E:0.093272 |  You play eight fixtures, which take you up to the end of January.
[4035.24 - 4038.24] P:1714.64 E:0.110040 |  The top eight go straight through to the last 16.
[4038.24 - 4041.36] P:1883.00 E:0.104538 |  If you finish between ninth and 24,
[4041.36 - 4044.64] P:1930.71 E:0.088288 |  you then go into a playoff game
[4044.64 - 4048.08] P:1747.23 E:0.084594 |  to try and get into that last 16.
[4048.08 - 4052.00] P:1639.66 E:0.103222 |  And anything below 24, 25 to 36, that is your European season over.
[4052.00 - 4053.48] P:1716.04 E:0.094075 |  I don't know what was more entertaining
[4053.48 - 4055.04] P:1886.02 E:0.096488 |  as scrambling around at the start of the season,
[4055.04 - 4057.52] P:1930.32 E:0.103069 |  trying to understand it, or sitting next to you, John and Ian,
[4057.52 - 4060.76] P:1784.60 E:0.107264 |  when the tables were going up and down towards the end of the league stages.
[4060.76 - 4062.80] P:1736.03 E:0.081156 |  Yeah, that is good fun to watch that happen.
[4062.80 - 4063.68] P:1676.19 E:0.089112 |  Great to be involved in.
[4063.68 - 4065.32] P:1724.61 E:0.102900 |  Here's Calafiore on the left for Arsenal.
[4065.32 - 4070.88] P:1763.13 E:0.094445 |  Esa, nice bit of skill fouled on the corner of the athletic Bilbao penalty area.
[4070.88 - 4071.76] P:1737.98 E:0.086645 |  Just too quick there.
[4071.76 - 4072.64] P:1885.45 E:0.101014 |  He went through the gap.
[4072.64 - 4074.04] P:1719.76 E:0.083056 |  Howard Eghitha stuck a leg out,
[4074.04 - 4076.40] P:1612.53 E:0.090389 |  and Esa has won an important free kick for Arsenal.
[4076.40 - 4077.44] P:1479.88 E:0.083150 |  And better already.
[4077.44 - 4078.88] P:1798.09 E:0.092971 |  Spoke about it a half time to Steve.
[4078.88 - 4080.12] P:1503.52 E:0.091621 |  Esa staying wider.
[4080.12 - 4081.68] P:1614.69 E:0.093165 |  That time he gets the ball, he gets possession.
[4081.68 - 4084.12] P:1660.90 E:0.099357 |  He tries to get around the outside, take his full back on,
[4084.12 - 4087.00] P:1828.04 E:0.098527 |  and as you say, wins a free kick in a really good position.
[4087.00 - 4088.96] P:1754.26 E:0.110841 |  It's actually Robert Navarro who caught him.
[4088.96 - 4093.48] P:1736.72 E:0.101646 |  Arsenal have got Ryring goal, Timber, Moschera, Gabrielle and Calafiore.
[4093.52 - 4097.64] P:1739.16 E:0.087285 |  Saliba is on the bench, so close to fitness, ready to be involved again.
[4097.64 - 4100.40] P:1750.59 E:0.098951 |  Rice on the yellow card, got that early in the game.
[4100.40 - 4103.40] P:1726.33 E:0.083077 |  Zubemendi, Merino is the midfield three,
[4103.40 - 4106.76] P:1861.49 E:0.086404 |  and Zubemendi and Merino, born in the Basque country,
[4106.76 - 4108.08] P:1969.51 E:0.106499 |  played their football here.
[4108.08 - 4109.52] P:1854.66 E:0.091347 |  They're all about playing here,
[4109.52 - 4112.24] P:2018.03 E:0.104787 |  and look at all those Arsenal players in the blue shirts.
[4112.24 - 4114.36] P:1952.37 E:0.079722 |  Four of them, cluster of them,
[4114.36 - 4117.84] P:1941.74 E:0.100347 |  lurking on the far right of the Athletic Bilbao area.
[4117.84 - 4121.32] P:1954.68 E:0.094486 |  The Athletic Bilbao defenders still steadfastly staying in the line.
[4121.36 - 4123.64] P:2009.21 E:0.095371 |  Then the Arsenal players move in the gaps in between them.
[4123.64 - 4125.60] P:1786.92 E:0.104604 |  Ball comes in, far post, headed down wide.
[4125.60 - 4129.72] P:1842.84 E:0.096838 |  Good chance, Yurkarez at the back post, got power on the header,
[4129.72 - 4131.24] P:1949.38 E:0.081366 |  didn't get the direction.
[4131.24 - 4132.96] P:1814.46 E:0.081714 |  That's a great chance for Arsenal.
[4132.96 - 4135.96] P:1878.37 E:0.097900 |  Best chance of the game, it's of course at Yurkarez at the far post.
[4135.96 - 4139.04] P:1730.59 E:0.110788 |  Simple set play once again, Declan Rice with the delivery.
[4139.80 - 4141.72] P:1688.41 E:0.111880 |  All four Arsenal players attacking the ball,
[4141.72 - 4144.40] P:1658.62 E:0.105580 |  starting the cluster at the back of the defensive line
[4144.40 - 4146.20] P:1652.03 E:0.104046 |  of the Athletic Bilbao players.
[4146.20 - 4148.48] P:1682.47 E:0.110841 |  They all break and try and breach that line.
[4149.40 - 4151.00] P:1527.50 E:0.130996 |  Yurkarez is the one that holds his run.
[4151.04 - 4153.84] P:1637.70 E:0.092975 |  He goes round the back, ends up with a free header.
[4153.84 - 4155.68] P:1604.68 E:0.097561 |  Almost inexplicably puts it wide.
[4155.68 - 4157.80] P:1471.52 E:0.088495 |  Amichela Teta's got his head in his hand.
[4157.80 - 4159.16] P:1655.65 E:0.094192 |  Got to be testing the goalkeeper there,
[4159.16 - 4161.40] P:1661.83 E:0.097499 |  he's got a header at the least, absolutely.
[4161.40 - 4164.20] P:1542.30 E:0.103046 |  He's a quality player, but he's a very good player
[4164.20 - 4166.00] P:1612.36 E:0.089371 |  in and around the box with his header as well.
[4166.00 - 4169.16] P:1650.96 E:0.095083 |  That was a free header from what, six yards out, granted it was on the angle.
[4169.16 - 4170.76] P:1741.59 E:0.070691 |  Didn't even hit the target.
[4170.76 - 4172.96] P:1646.27 E:0.098401 |  So good chance for Arsenal at the start of this second half.
[4172.96 - 4175.88] P:1672.54 E:0.095548 |  So it's Madwake and Eza, either side of Yurkarez,
[4175.88 - 4177.28] P:1826.35 E:0.087125 |  just to complete that Arsenal line-up.
[4177.28 - 4179.00] P:1683.23 E:0.099242 |  I'll give you the Athletic Bilbao team in a second.
[4179.00 - 4180.92] P:1670.42 E:0.094607 |  That's a complete miscue by Vivian.
[4181.16 - 4183.88] P:1626.26 E:0.107125 |  And then Paredes has panicked and bundled into Yurkarez.
[4183.88 - 4185.04] P:1844.13 E:0.087469 |  Doesn't get the free kick, actually.
[4185.04 - 4186.60] P:1760.05 E:0.120467 |  The ball's still high in the air.
[4186.60 - 4191.68] P:1863.62 E:0.093738 |  Then there is a foul committed on Inyaki Williams by Julian Timber.
[4191.68 - 4194.84] P:1713.58 E:0.086094 |  And so that will be a free kick for Athletic Bilbao.
[4194.84 - 4197.20] P:1658.43 E:0.096036 |  Unai Simon is their goalkeeper.
[4197.20 - 4203.48] P:1612.85 E:0.099876 |  And Doni Gorisabo, Danny Vivian, Aitor Paredes and Adama Boiro are the back four.
[4203.48 - 4206.92] P:1772.12 E:0.092114 |  The full backs this evening, both making their first start to the season.
[4206.92 - 4208.48] P:1625.71 E:0.090837 |  Gorisabo and Boiro.
[4208.52 - 4215.72] P:1657.58 E:0.078188 |  Mikhail Vesga has come into central midfield to partner the 21-year-old Mikhail Hauregitha.
[4215.72 - 4219.96] P:1552.72 E:0.108124 |  Inyaki Williams, Oyan Santhet, Robert Navarro.
[4221.32 - 4226.76] P:1730.82 E:0.092314 |  And Alex Berengue, make up the Athletic 11.
[4226.76 - 4230.96] P:1600.97 E:0.089048 |  They've got to throw five yards inside the Arsenal half on the right.
[4230.96 - 4235.72] P:1553.76 E:0.104051 |  Gorisabo throws it down hard into the turf and it skids to the feet of Vivian.
[4235.72 - 4240.64] P:1523.78 E:0.085400 |  Across to the other centre-back, Paredes, plays back to Simon.
[4240.64 - 4243.56] P:1651.74 E:0.100367 |  Marino is highest up the field for Arsenal there, puts the pressure on.
[4243.56 - 4248.96] P:1572.15 E:0.089727 |  Long ball downfield, headed away by Moskera, modded infield there by Vesga.
[4248.96 - 4253.52] P:1715.94 E:0.099969 |  Now, Yurka is going to chase a ball to the edge of the Athletic area.
[4253.52 - 4257.28] P:1652.12 E:0.094745 |  It was awkward there, bounced high and eventually volleyed away by Simon.
[4257.28 - 4259.08] P:1673.96 E:0.088511 |  Out for a throw to Arsenal, taken quickly.
[4259.08 - 4262.56] P:1707.53 E:0.095361 |  Timber into the feet of Marino to Madueke.
[4262.56 - 4265.36] P:1762.90 E:0.104458 |  Quickly gives it back to Marino, who dummies the cross with his right foot.
[4265.36 - 4268.80] P:1791.99 E:0.108239 |  Low ball with his left, looking for Timber, easily read, intercepted.
[4268.80 - 4270.72] P:1673.80 E:0.118069 |  And now, Athletic come on the break.
[4270.72 - 4273.20] P:1705.77 E:0.109758 |  Chance here, Navarro wants it played into his path.
[4273.20 - 4276.52] P:1704.65 E:0.101927 |  Santhet plays it to the left-hand side to Inyaki Williams.
[4276.52 - 4280.16] P:1696.37 E:0.101012 |  Slides a pass in down the left, Berengue gets there, slightly off balance.
[4280.16 - 4281.88] P:1675.76 E:0.118063 |  He's run that over the dead ball line, I think.
[4281.88 - 4286.28] P:1700.85 E:0.106318 |  Then he's caught by Gabrielle, picks himself up, goes down again
[4286.28 - 4288.88] P:1888.23 E:0.111376 |  and eventually it goes out for a throw-in to Arsenal.
[4288.88 - 4291.92] P:1948.43 E:0.099622 |  And Gabrielle celebrates the defensive work.
[4291.92 - 4293.08] P:1953.51 E:0.099710 |  He's just done for his team.
[4293.08 - 4294.08] P:1778.75 E:0.104732 |  Paul Robinson.
[4294.08 - 4298.68] P:1846.78 E:0.088567 |  A really good, quick, dissected break from the Athletic club players there.
[4298.68 - 4300.88] P:1774.16 E:0.099082 |  Really swift on the turnover of possession.
[4300.88 - 4302.08] P:1727.80 E:0.099144 |  I think he chose the wrong option.
[4302.08 - 4304.40] P:1844.69 E:0.098736 |  I think the better option was Grisabel on the right-hand side.
[4304.40 - 4307.08] P:1734.46 E:0.092689 |  The overlap was there, chose to pass it to this near side.
[4307.08 - 4308.68] P:1778.23 E:0.082593 |  To Inyaki Williams.
[4308.68 - 4309.92] P:1781.49 E:0.106781 |  Fought really hard for the ball.
[4309.92 - 4313.52] P:1935.21 E:0.089483 |  They thought they should have had a free kick on two occasions.
[4313.52 - 4314.52] P:1784.03 E:0.114304 |  Here they are again.
[4314.52 - 4317.40] P:1796.30 E:0.101707 |  Inyaki Williams tries to hit a curler from the edge of the penalty area.
[4317.40 - 4319.20] P:1762.98 E:0.096290 |  That's blocked. It comes back to Berengue.
[4319.20 - 4321.24] P:1768.16 E:0.091045 |  Berengue running with the ball at his feet.
[4321.24 - 4323.88] P:1722.07 E:0.084555 |  Lays it off here to Garisabel.
[4323.88 - 4324.64] P:1708.26 E:0.094029 |  Howard-Aguitha.
[4324.64 - 4327.48] P:1725.25 E:0.092218 |  Straight ball down the middle, down the channel.
[4327.48 - 4328.96] P:1713.62 E:0.112993 |  Good defensive work from Arsenal.
[4328.96 - 4330.84] P:1705.85 E:0.099454 |  There's Rice, passes it out to Ezra.
[4330.84 - 4332.48] P:1721.94 E:0.111317 |  That's intercepted by Vesga.
[4332.48 - 4335.80] P:1901.13 E:0.104667 |  Comes back to Ezra in the left-back position.
[4335.80 - 4340.00] P:1895.51 E:0.102559 |  Pauls rings around the stadium from the Athletic Bilbao fans again.
[4340.00 - 4342.16] P:1770.91 E:0.096499 |  You know what I'm saying in the first half?
[4342.16 - 4345.56] P:1843.94 E:0.103672 |  That you weren't able to support any other team if you lived in this city.
[4345.56 - 4348.96] P:1670.82 E:0.098684 |  Seeing someone wearing a Dennis Burr camp shirt in this stand.
[4348.96 - 4351.72] P:1654.55 E:0.103718 |  And the kid wearing a cold-parm-a-sher as well.
[4351.72 - 4355.52] P:1609.06 E:0.085574 |  So a couple of different bits of garb in and around us.
[4355.52 - 4357.52] P:1722.47 E:0.098773 |  Here's Yurkarez gets it out to Madwake.
[4357.52 - 4359.32] P:1706.89 E:0.100433 |  He got the pace here to go down the outside.
[4359.32 - 4361.32] P:1813.20 E:0.102472 |  Still Madwake, he pokes it towards the near post.
[4361.32 - 4365.00] P:1856.50 E:0.100322 |  It hits Simon, who had it covered, stuck out a left hand.
[4365.00 - 4367.68] P:1662.55 E:0.105384 |  And Arsenal go close again early in this second half. It's 0-0.
[4367.68 - 4368.80] P:1700.98 E:0.108822 |  He gets lucky there.
[4368.80 - 4371.04] P:1829.57 E:0.105738 |  Simon, the Athletic Good goalkeeper.
[4371.04 - 4372.52] P:1916.97 E:0.114284 |  Madwake once again does brilliantly.
[4372.52 - 4374.08] P:1832.19 E:0.096657 |  He gets all the way to the byline.
[4374.08 - 4375.32] P:1825.36 E:0.122107 |  I think he gets it a little bit wrong.
[4375.32 - 4377.28] P:1911.55 E:0.101184 |  He looks to play it across the six-yard box
[4377.32 - 4378.72] P:1853.83 E:0.113039 |  with the outside of his left boot.
[4378.72 - 4380.56] P:1878.01 E:0.100849 |  Actually, it's the inside of his left boot.
[4380.56 - 4382.12] P:1862.74 E:0.124739 |  Could have done Simon at his near post.
[4382.12 - 4385.68] P:1736.53 E:0.087908 |  Sticks a left hand out and gets lucky that he makes the block.
[4385.68 - 4387.04] P:1676.75 E:0.110801 |  Going to see the replay of it now.
[4387.04 - 4389.28] P:1662.89 E:0.101862 |  Madwake looking to score that first goal for Arsenal.
[4389.28 - 4391.28] P:1605.42 E:0.096075 |  Yeah, and Simon, you're absolutely right, Paul.
[4391.28 - 4392.96] P:1745.97 E:0.082053 |  Stuck out the big left hand.
[4392.96 - 4395.76] P:1581.49 E:0.104568 |  Paul just hit it and spun to safety.
[4395.76 - 4398.48] P:1688.95 E:0.103822 |  Cleared down the left-hand touch line by Boyerow.
[4398.48 - 4399.44] P:1820.87 E:0.085447 |  Throw in for Arsenal.
[4399.44 - 4401.72] P:1710.41 E:0.092860 |  Timber takes it early stages of the second half.
[4401.72 - 4403.12] P:1721.62 E:0.095745 |  Zubemendi, a couple of touches.
[4403.12 - 4404.52] P:1707.83 E:0.087175 |  Can't quite get the ball down.
[4404.56 - 4407.92] P:1732.06 E:0.093423 |  Controls it on his right thigh, passes it low to Timber.
[4407.92 - 4410.12] P:1724.98 E:0.094738 |  Two red and white shirted defenders in front of him.
[4410.12 - 4411.64] P:1788.57 E:0.109005 |  Tries to take them both on.
[4411.64 - 4413.04] P:1849.13 E:0.086479 |  He's tackled there.
[4413.04 - 4415.72] P:1788.39 E:0.114056 |  And Berengea is going to bring it away down the left.
[4415.72 - 4416.60] P:1942.21 E:0.107916 |  Foul by Zubemendi.
[4416.60 - 4418.40] P:1946.10 E:0.103114 |  He's broken the play-out early for Arsenal there.
[4418.40 - 4421.00] P:1856.73 E:0.093023 |  Conceded the free kick and Arsenal will back off.
[4421.00 - 4423.72] P:1819.94 E:0.088653 |  Talking about defenders doing fabulous bits of skill
[4423.72 - 4424.96] P:1759.41 E:0.091067 |  in the right wing position.
[4424.96 - 4426.72] P:1643.30 E:0.125372 |  Last season here, you saw Harry Maguire.
[4426.72 - 4429.44] P:1879.91 E:0.109804 |  Do you remember that bit of magic he did to create the...
[4429.44 - 4431.04] P:1773.66 E:0.115974 |  It was Casimiros' goal, I think, wasn't it?
[4431.04 - 4432.60] P:1775.38 E:0.120850 |  Casimiros' goal, yeah.
[4432.60 - 4435.04] P:1773.91 E:0.119577 |  It's been a good stadium for English teams, hasn't it?
[4435.04 - 4437.52] P:1878.90 E:0.107721 |  Obviously Manchester United come here and winning 3-0.
[4437.52 - 4439.28] P:1757.47 E:0.124520 |  Not so good for them the next time they turned up here,
[4439.28 - 4441.96] P:1726.23 E:0.107025 |  but Tottenham ended that 17-year trophy drought
[4441.96 - 4443.24] P:1733.17 E:0.110726 |  in this wonderful stadium.
[4444.56 - 4447.84] P:1796.62 E:0.085096 |  Free kick for Athletic.
[4447.84 - 4450.68] P:1718.45 E:0.092201 |  Athletic club, Athletic club of Bilbao.
[4450.68 - 4453.48] P:1622.41 E:0.108033 |  We must have said it ten different times.
[4454.68 - 4457.32] P:1784.13 E:0.082854 |  Simon, with his right foot.
[4457.32 - 4458.76] P:1625.27 E:0.096642 |  Can't get it right for everyone.
[4458.76 - 4461.44] P:1714.60 E:0.075331 |  That's the problem. Miss Q there from Madwake.
[4461.48 - 4462.88] P:1595.53 E:0.097432 |  Trying to hit it first time on the half folly.
[4462.88 - 4464.80] P:1626.76 E:0.089325 |  Howard Agitha, lobbed one forward.
[4464.80 - 4466.28] P:1578.41 E:0.098416 |  Moskera heads it away.
[4466.28 - 4467.80] P:1606.11 E:0.094696 |  Marino climbs highest.
[4467.80 - 4471.52] P:1581.15 E:0.095897 |  Heads it to his left, where he finds Ezzer.
[4471.52 - 4473.12] P:1696.57 E:0.101661 |  Ezzer back to Calafiori.
[4473.12 - 4475.96] P:1789.06 E:0.088531 |  Good start to the second half made by Arsenal.
[4475.96 - 4477.84] P:1670.15 E:0.118390 |  Change, kicked this evening.
[4477.84 - 4481.36] P:1765.67 E:0.109151 |  Dark blue shirts, red stripes down the arms.
[4481.36 - 4483.16] P:1837.73 E:0.104536 |  Looks like gold numbers on the back, actually.
[4483.16 - 4485.28] P:1780.68 E:0.114947 |  White shorts or grey shorts, I would say.
[4485.28 - 4487.64] P:1827.66 E:0.097582 |  Grey shorts and grey socks.
[4487.64 - 4491.04] P:1632.38 E:0.090784 |  And here's Gabrielle, the captain with the bright yellow.
[4491.04 - 4495.88] P:1536.30 E:0.088817 |  The captain's armband wrapped around his left bicep.
[4495.88 - 4498.48] P:1525.91 E:0.101085 |  Timber on the right-hand side.
[4498.48 - 4503.20] P:1641.14 E:0.095282 |  Max Dauman on the bench for Arsenal this evening.
[4503.20 - 4504.88] P:1714.02 E:0.107425 |  If he does get onto the pitch tonight,
[4504.88 - 4508.52] P:1797.32 E:0.101119 |  he'll become the youngest player ever to feature
[4508.52 - 4510.32] P:1667.59 E:0.110464 |  for Arsenal in European competition.
[4510.32 - 4513.00] P:1711.90 E:0.103860 |  Still 0-0, Calafiori stoopes, chest one down.
[4513.00 - 4514.64] P:1656.70 E:0.117221 |  Pass goes astray inside, the Arsenal half.
[4514.64 - 4517.04] P:1709.69 E:0.113523 |  Marino slides in, got the ball, says the referee.
[4517.04 - 4518.24] P:1822.91 E:0.117250 |  Had a good view of that.
[4518.24 - 4520.60] P:1920.45 E:0.115728 |  Zubemendi's there, plays it away to the right.
[4520.60 - 4522.84] P:2021.48 E:0.119227 |  And Madueke, one-on-one with Boyro.
[4522.84 - 4525.44] P:2006.12 E:0.109020 |  He'll fancy that, let it go bow, getting back in numbers there.
[4525.44 - 4528.44] P:2002.45 E:0.110023 |  Madueke stops, passes back to Timber behind him.
[4528.44 - 4529.88] P:2079.32 E:0.116423 |  He's a good outlet, Madueke.
[4529.88 - 4531.52] P:2160.50 E:0.127572 |  Every time that Arsenal turnover possession,
[4531.52 - 4533.04] P:2169.67 E:0.118328 |  they look to this right-hand side.
[4533.04 - 4536.32] P:2285.45 E:0.126110 |  But now, as they're on the ball, he is noticeably staying a lot wider.
[4536.32 - 4538.12] P:2201.25 E:0.108553 |  The pitch is a lot bigger, which is why Arsenal
[4538.12 - 4539.96] P:2111.87 E:0.103053 |  are dominating possession in the second half.
[4539.96 - 4543.68] P:2009.86 E:0.106631 |  They're able to stretch the pitch and the likes of Defton Rice, Zubemendi.
[4543.68 - 4546.68] P:1938.49 E:0.087825 |  Marino, they can dictate the pace of the game.
[4546.68 - 4549.68] P:1944.72 E:0.101301 |  Champions League football on five live and BBC sounds.
[4549.76 - 4552.28] P:1862.85 E:0.103299 |  Tottenham Villareal on the way in full, eight o'clock tonight.
[4552.28 - 4554.04] P:1865.13 E:0.084205 |  The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium,
[4554.04 - 4556.88] P:1672.65 E:0.097407 |  as they make their return to the competition under Thomas Frank,
[4556.88 - 4558.64] P:1480.17 E:0.096659 |  Conor McNamara and Chris Sutton,
[4558.64 - 4560.40] P:1714.18 E:0.115620 |  will be bringing you that one.
[4560.40 - 4561.92] P:1767.08 E:0.113092 |  All the other goals as they go in.
[4561.92 - 4564.12] P:1715.74 E:0.088777 |  Champions League final score tonight,
[4564.12 - 4567.08] P:1630.27 E:0.090601 |  available via the iPlayer website and app.
[4567.08 - 4568.32] P:1663.55 E:0.119859 |  So you can keep across it all.
[4568.32 - 4570.12] P:1827.63 E:0.096917 |  Good control by Timber, the pass was behind him.
[4570.12 - 4571.44] P:1725.65 E:0.097617 |  Looking for Madueke, Madueke.
[4571.44 - 4574.84] P:1829.52 E:0.114784 |  On the angle, nearly got the cut back to Yurka Rez.
[4574.84 - 4577.60] P:1779.15 E:0.095910 |  Foot stuck out by Vivian, blocked it.
[4577.60 - 4578.76] P:1611.00 E:0.107689 |  Cross comes in from Marino.
[4578.84 - 4580.76] P:1677.55 E:0.098064 |  Deep one, Rice is waiting at the far post.
[4580.76 - 4582.20] P:1647.14 E:0.089217 |  It doesn't quite reach him.
[4582.20 - 4585.52] P:1587.88 E:0.096819 |  Navarro controls it on the laces of his right boot.
[4585.52 - 4587.44] P:1693.05 E:0.095599 |  Calafiore is right behind him.
[4587.44 - 4589.88] P:1722.46 E:0.105893 |  Navarro's heading towards his own corner flag here.
[4589.88 - 4591.36] P:1720.15 E:0.105120 |  Got to be careful, turning.
[4591.36 - 4593.56] P:1765.93 E:0.112847 |  Clears with his right foot. Good pressure there, no foul.
[4593.56 - 4594.48] P:1671.97 E:0.108515 |  Arsenal get the throw.
[4594.48 - 4597.32] P:1616.08 E:0.108746 |  I'll tell you what, Yurka Rez is going to make a difference for Arsenal this season.
[4597.32 - 4598.88] P:1797.28 E:0.117785 |  Watching him now, he runs tirelessly.
[4598.88 - 4600.48] P:1523.78 E:0.102346 |  That run there that he was in behind,
[4600.48 - 4602.72] P:1705.55 E:0.128630 |  the ball in from Timber was actually meant for him.
[4602.72 - 4606.00] P:1975.09 E:0.114268 |  Came to Madueke, but it was Yurka Rez's run that caused the problems.
[4606.00 - 4608.12] P:2085.15 E:0.109937 |  They should have a foul there from Ezzar.
[4608.12 - 4610.08] P:1957.16 E:0.105126 |  Attack continues, here's Madueke onto the left foot.
[4610.08 - 4613.16] P:1889.67 E:0.103708 |  Once hit, the currently deflected Simon down quickly to his left hand side.
[4613.16 - 4614.80] P:2009.48 E:0.119299 |  That was sneaking in at the near post.
[4614.80 - 4616.08] P:2057.43 E:0.114616 |  Good save by the goalkeeper.
[4616.08 - 4618.44] P:2170.06 E:0.122121 |  Well again, Madueke on this right hand side.
[4618.44 - 4621.12] P:2199.06 E:0.116867 |  That time instead of going around the outside, he causes problems.
[4621.12 - 4624.84] P:2221.19 E:0.110910 |  Cuts in, goes across the 18-yard box, tries to fire it across Simon
[4624.84 - 4626.36] P:2041.85 E:0.095848 |  into the far right hand corner.
[4626.36 - 4628.80] P:2026.24 E:0.100196 |  Takes two deflections and was creeping in at the near post,
[4628.80 - 4630.72] P:1856.40 E:0.078974 |  but Simon was alert to it.
[4630.72 - 4634.08] P:1754.75 E:0.099490 |  Paul gave me this fantastic start ahead of this game, which I'd not seen.
[4634.12 - 4636.96] P:1701.85 E:0.091256 |  The Arsenal are trying to do something here, Paul,
[4636.96 - 4641.72] P:1775.11 E:0.106801 |  that no team has ever done in the history of the European Cup.
[4641.72 - 4645.08] P:1793.56 E:0.108329 |  And I'm going to allow you to deliver it when we get the next break in play.
[4645.08 - 4648.60] P:1804.41 E:0.094938 |  Califiori wins it for Arsenal inside his own half.
[4648.60 - 4650.52] P:1789.84 E:0.101198 |  Zubemendi gets the move in quickly.
[4650.52 - 4653.72] P:1808.29 E:0.102824 |  Diagonal to Madueke, seeing more of the ball in this second half.
[4653.72 - 4656.56] P:1851.29 E:0.094216 |  Madueke running at Boiro, two defenders there.
[4656.56 - 4657.56] P:1861.95 E:0.110644 |  They can't deal with him at the moment.
[4657.56 - 4659.04] P:1897.29 E:0.117293 |  Then Boiro does well.
[4659.04 - 4661.00] P:1918.22 E:0.102209 |  Watches the ball, gets a left foot on it.
[4661.00 - 4666.20] P:1837.28 E:0.096294 |  Madueke's tackled, and Boiro is able to bring it away down the left pass-up.
[4666.20 - 4668.16] P:1712.72 E:0.106241 |  Towards Santhe, he couldn't control it.
[4668.16 - 4672.88] P:1686.10 E:0.079444 |  It's gone out for a throw-in to Arsenal, which Timber takes.
[4672.88 - 4674.88] P:1734.64 E:0.092966 |  Timber throws back to Mosquera.
[4674.88 - 4678.00] P:1525.19 E:0.091851 |  Mosquera passes to Declan Rice.
[4678.00 - 4680.92] P:1628.35 E:0.108410 |  Rice inside his own half, forwards to Zubemendi, who looks busy.
[4680.92 - 4682.16] P:1799.81 E:0.108054 |  Always tackled there.
[4682.16 - 4685.00] P:1760.28 E:0.095121 |  Santhe charging forward for Athletic.
[4685.00 - 4687.68] P:1739.15 E:0.109606 |  Great support on the right-hand side from Inaki Williams.
[4687.68 - 4689.84] P:1709.35 E:0.100923 |  Into the Arsenal penalty area, onto that left foot.
[4689.88 - 4691.28] P:1759.13 E:0.111072 |  Shops on to the right, hits the shot.
[4691.28 - 4693.28] P:1819.43 E:0.098255 |  Easy save for Raya.
[4693.28 - 4694.28] P:1870.36 E:0.107328 |  Low down to his left.
[4694.28 - 4695.80] P:1772.99 E:0.109777 |  This game is certainly livening up.
[4695.80 - 4697.64] P:1846.39 E:0.102140 |  Certainly opening up, and that's tacked to Arsenal.
[4697.64 - 4699.64] P:1691.92 E:0.108770 |  Been a little bit more proactive playing on the front foot,
[4699.64 - 4702.24] P:1627.04 E:0.102226 |  but in turn they've left itself a little bit more exposed.
[4702.24 - 4704.72] P:1507.17 E:0.115981 |  Inaki Williams, that time it was on the right-hand side.
[4704.72 - 4708.60] P:1610.63 E:0.105161 |  He gets his shot on his right foot, on an angle from about 12 yards.
[4708.60 - 4712.32] P:1751.59 E:0.087870 |  David Rea, perfectly positioned, had his angles absolutely such the perfection.
[4712.32 - 4714.64] P:1913.45 E:0.095777 |  Went down to his near post and made a comfortable save.
[4714.64 - 4717.24] P:2000.07 E:0.088699 |  But the first real save that Rea has had to make.
[4717.28 - 4719.28] P:1851.20 E:0.100108 |  How could it build down 0, Arsenal 0?
[4719.28 - 4724.32] P:1812.80 E:0.094446 |  Ernesto Valverde, the 61-year-old in charge of Athletic.
[4724.32 - 4728.36] P:1853.57 E:0.103113 |  In the black T-shirt, black trousers and trainers this evening.
[4728.36 - 4730.48] P:1802.43 E:0.111081 |  Out on the edge of the pitch, trying to get some instructions
[4730.48 - 4731.48] P:1763.66 E:0.108448 |  across to his players.
[4731.48 - 4734.68] P:1590.81 E:0.097680 |  Mosqueda walking pace inside his own half.
[4734.68 - 4739.52] P:1703.86 E:0.090108 |  Low little pass to his right to Zubemendi, across to Timber.
[4739.52 - 4742.76] P:1767.84 E:0.089921 |  Some of the subs are getting a shout here for Athletic.
[4742.76 - 4746.32] P:1769.55 E:0.091334 |  So I think they're about to make at least one change.
[4746.40 - 4749.20] P:1641.14 E:0.076571 |  Timber gets the ball on the right.
[4749.20 - 4753.44] P:1746.55 E:0.085654 |  When they do make that change, that'll be the time for Paul's killer stat.
[4753.44 - 4754.56] P:1887.15 E:0.117346 |  I tell you what, you're bigging it up,
[4754.56 - 4757.16] P:1962.96 E:0.094436 |  but I've just had to quickly go back through my WhatsApp messages.
[4757.16 - 4758.92] P:1835.98 E:0.113168 |  Because I deleted it once I sent you it.
[4758.92 - 4760.60] P:1892.32 E:0.101065 |  I thought that's a you stat, not me.
[4760.60 - 4763.00] P:1776.25 E:0.091278 |  OK, I've got it. I've got it if you need it.
[4763.00 - 4765.08] P:1685.90 E:0.096272 |  I think you'll remember it. Here's Rice up towards Timber.
[4765.08 - 4767.36] P:1668.89 E:0.089377 |  Good turn inside the Athletic Bill Bauham.
[4767.36 - 4769.68] P:1750.52 E:0.091211 |  That's a ridiculous foul from Paradeys.
[4769.68 - 4772.96] P:1753.57 E:0.100671 |  Grabbed him with both arms, slung him left-right, left again,
[4772.96 - 4775.00] P:1882.93 E:0.099873 |  threw him to the floor and then looks at the referee and says,
[4775.04 - 4776.76] P:1999.98 E:0.091052 |  how's that free kick? Well, it is.
[4776.76 - 4778.76] P:2019.04 E:0.090078 |  Definitely a free kick there.
[4778.76 - 4781.48] P:1890.50 E:0.103406 |  Almost manhandled him there inside his own half.
[4781.48 - 4784.40] P:1706.92 E:0.105546 |  Arsenal growing in confidence as the game goes.
[4784.40 - 4786.48] P:1886.22 E:0.091487 |  They'll take more and more chances going forward.
[4786.48 - 4789.28] P:1969.50 E:0.094206 |  Defensively solid, but they will put free kicks forward.
[4789.28 - 4791.44] P:1865.35 E:0.102769 |  Ida Wecky once again on the ball on this right-hand side.
[4791.44 - 4794.72] P:1710.36 E:0.089672 |  Yeah, he's looked a real threat for Arsenal in this second half.
[4794.72 - 4796.32] P:1670.93 E:0.110306 |  Teasing Boiro this time.
[4796.32 - 4799.24] P:1697.37 E:0.096505 |  Dummies the cross with the left foot back onto that left foot.
[4799.24 - 4800.52] P:1677.99 E:0.074786 |  Here's Rice.
[4800.52 - 4804.64] P:1641.87 E:0.102727 |  Receives the low pass from Madueke back to Zubemendi across to Gabrielle.
[4804.68 - 4807.28] P:1647.27 E:0.097225 |  Gabrielle's 40 yards out inside left channel.
[4807.28 - 4809.68] P:1571.48 E:0.095622 |  Ezzer tackled.
[4809.68 - 4813.00] P:1576.42 E:0.107936 |  The move loses a little bit of momentum, but Gabrielle picks it up again.
[4813.00 - 4816.72] P:1495.04 E:0.099104 |  Passes into the centre-circle to find Zubemendi.
[4816.72 - 4817.68] P:1593.31 E:0.112129 |  Cross to Mosquera.
[4817.68 - 4822.84] P:1566.92 E:0.093952 |  Unai Gomez is waiting to come on and attacking midfielder for Athletic.
[4822.84 - 4824.36] P:1475.06 E:0.114138 |  A lot of Arsenal possession at the moment.
[4824.36 - 4825.64] P:1650.05 E:0.097074 |  Here's Mosquera.
[4825.64 - 4828.00] P:1763.02 E:0.106659 |  Coming up to an hour played in the game.
[4828.00 - 4831.28] P:1692.72 E:0.110860 |  Athletic Bill Bauham, Arsenal 0.
[4831.32 - 4834.96] P:1730.51 E:0.107437 |  A few more raucous singing and chanting
[4834.96 - 4836.64] P:1610.06 E:0.102806 |  from these fabulous home fans.
[4836.64 - 4838.96] P:1547.62 E:0.105828 |  Ezzer, diagonal ball left to right.
[4838.96 - 4841.44] P:1743.18 E:0.103877 |  Finds Madueke, kills it, stone dead first touch.
[4841.44 - 4843.12] P:1713.64 E:0.104468 |  Little trick, right foot down by the bar,
[4843.12 - 4845.72] P:1860.67 E:0.105850 |  and dinks the cross straight into the arms of Simon.
[4845.72 - 4847.52] P:1611.21 E:0.115127 |  That's the first thing he's got wrong tonight, Madueke.
[4847.52 - 4850.04] P:1640.24 E:0.109442 |  Did everything right, controlled it with the outside of his left foot,
[4850.04 - 4851.44] P:1683.44 E:0.124399 |  went round the outside,
[4851.44 - 4854.08] P:1852.04 E:0.116675 |  and then looks to pull the cross across the edge of the six-yard box.
[4854.08 - 4856.76] P:1883.15 E:0.115445 |  He just dinks it harmlessly into the goalkeeper's arms.
[4856.76 - 4860.28] P:2001.62 E:0.111305 |  Simon, having caught it, went quickly with the clearance.
[4860.28 - 4863.52] P:2049.33 E:0.114782 |  And it looked to be a one-on-one between Inyaki Williams and Mosquera,
[4863.52 - 4865.92] P:1863.36 E:0.101424 |  and the Athletic fans are complaining they felt Mosquera
[4865.92 - 4868.80] P:1872.00 E:0.102168 |  was holding Inyaki Williams back, to be honest.
[4868.80 - 4871.28] P:1875.01 E:0.114291 |  Six to one, half a dozen of the other.
[4871.28 - 4875.96] P:1919.87 E:0.109381 |  So, Unai Gomez is coming on for Robert Navarro.
[4875.96 - 4879.00] P:1910.56 E:0.116007 |  So, Arsenal this evening, Paul, are trying to do something
[4879.00 - 4883.40] P:1901.17 E:0.113143 |  no other team has done in the history of the European Cup Champions League, which is...
[4883.40 - 4886.24] P:1789.51 E:0.121839 |  Well, the longer it goes without them scoring, they're getting further away from it.
[4886.24 - 4887.36] P:1904.38 E:0.112085 |  But should they win tonight,
[4887.40 - 4890.76] P:1783.11 E:0.090746 |  they'll become the first side to ever beat Spanish teams,
[4890.76 - 4893.96] P:1763.66 E:0.097322 |  six games in a row in the European Cup and Champions League.
[4893.96 - 4896.00] P:1846.06 E:0.095313 |  So, basically, the whole history of the competition.
[4896.00 - 4899.72] P:1825.51 E:0.092402 |  Having taken down Real Madrid twice, Seville twice, and Girona.
[4899.72 - 4901.80] P:1649.47 E:0.083203 |  That'll be six.
[4901.80 - 4902.76] P:1833.19 E:0.095539 |  Competition first.
[4902.76 - 4904.80] P:1592.14 E:0.090859 |  Yeah, Real Madrid last season in the quarter-finals,
[4904.80 - 4909.16] P:1499.09 E:0.085838 |  Sevilla, home and away, group stages the year before that.
[4909.16 - 4910.80] P:1631.59 E:0.110539 |  Girona last season as well.
[4910.80 - 4912.28] P:1621.95 E:0.079251 |  That's the five.
[4912.28 - 4914.64] P:1521.83 E:0.102389 |  Six wins in a row would be a first ever
[4914.64 - 4917.44] P:1676.18 E:0.088239 |  in the history of this grand old competition.
[4917.44 - 4919.00] P:1601.80 E:0.104660 |  Michel Arteta's not bothered about that.
[4919.00 - 4919.96] P:1663.24 E:0.092179 |  He wants three points.
[4919.96 - 4922.24] P:1663.10 E:0.074317 |  At the very least, one point.
[4922.24 - 4923.36] P:1654.87 E:0.107648 |  This game is well balanced.
[4923.36 - 4926.92] P:1902.77 E:0.104638 |  Calafiore plays back to Raya, all in green.
[4926.92 - 4929.68] P:1977.54 E:0.100406 |  The Arsenal keeper, the Spaniard, Mosquera.
[4929.68 - 4932.48] P:1907.24 E:0.094541 |  Another Spaniard out to Timber in the right back position.
[4932.48 - 4934.40] P:1780.36 E:0.109417 |  Chase back by Gomez. Home fans love that.
[4934.40 - 4935.76] P:1666.88 E:0.091178 |  Oh, great run from Timber.
[4935.76 - 4938.24] P:1750.02 E:0.101973 |  Flicks it over Boyro.
[4938.24 - 4939.56] P:1845.04 E:0.121586 |  Paredes comes across.
[4939.56 - 4943.60] P:1769.57 E:0.098231 |  Has a hack in it. That turns into a decent pass here for Gomez.
[4943.64 - 4945.52] P:1658.95 E:0.105475 |  Curly here, bouncing on top of his head,
[4945.52 - 4947.96] P:1696.38 E:0.102398 |  plays it to Boyro, continues his run on the left.
[4947.96 - 4949.76] P:1773.11 E:0.093654 |  Good block by Mosquera.
[4949.76 - 4951.52] P:1590.69 E:0.103356 |  Mosquera muscles him off the ball as well,
[4951.52 - 4954.48] P:1705.90 E:0.107692 |  passes down the right to Timber, lay off here to Medwake.
[4954.48 - 4957.28] P:1874.75 E:0.111564 |  Sliding challenge, important one from Jada Geitha.
[4957.28 - 4958.76] P:1886.41 E:0.101434 |  The fans are on their feet.
[4958.76 - 4961.12] P:1820.67 E:0.099627 |  And look at that response there between player and fans.
[4961.12 - 4963.20] P:1740.64 E:0.082346 |  Again, all as one. Fantastic.
[4963.20 - 4965.28] P:1605.50 E:0.110947 |  It's become a lot more open the game now.
[4965.28 - 4967.56] P:1725.28 E:0.103944 |  Arsenal taking chances in the final third.
[4967.56 - 4969.20] P:1866.11 E:0.114313 |  Looking to move the ball forward.
[4969.20 - 4970.40] P:1702.91 E:0.118844 |  Homeside sense in that.
[4970.40 - 4972.48] P:1695.58 E:0.115823 |  Both teams at the moment looking to win the game.
[4972.48 - 4975.08] P:1708.37 E:0.108975 |  What a point in the game where there's an opportunity now to go on.
[4975.08 - 4977.32] P:1716.05 E:0.114580 |  Neither side are really thinking about a point at this stage,
[4977.32 - 4979.28] P:1546.29 E:0.102329 |  both wanting to take all three.
[4979.28 - 4982.52] P:1787.71 E:0.094803 |  Giant flags flying in the home end away to our left.
[4982.52 - 4985.92] P:1715.33 E:0.097567 |  Athletic Bilbao intercept, break up an Arsenal attack.
[4985.92 - 4987.08] P:1723.03 E:0.109135 |  Pass forward, no good.
[4987.08 - 4990.20] P:1721.43 E:0.092389 |  Gabrielle is there into the last half hour of the game.
[4990.20 - 4994.44] P:1692.84 E:0.092235 |  Arsenal yet to make a change.
[4994.44 - 4997.08] P:1602.82 E:0.109225 |  Calafiore's got space to work with on the left.
[4997.08 - 5000.20] P:1586.57 E:0.096138 |  Ezzer, edge of the penalty area, trying to make himself available.
[5000.20 - 5001.96] P:1610.21 E:0.099949 |  They're going to switch left to right again.
[5001.96 - 5003.28] P:1503.56 E:0.096141 |  Look for the danger man, Manuweke.
[5003.28 - 5006.52] P:1643.15 E:0.088879 |  Ball bounces in front of him. He leaps high, controls it athletically,
[5006.52 - 5009.40] P:1738.79 E:0.095567 |  rolls it back into the path of Timber, onto his right foot,
[5009.40 - 5010.88] P:1565.10 E:0.093602 |  stands the cross up into the box.
[5010.88 - 5012.56] P:1703.23 E:0.094286 |  Ezzer trying to get on the end of it.
[5012.56 - 5016.12] P:1799.29 E:0.090539 |  Beaten to that, header finds Zubemendi.
[5016.12 - 5018.96] P:1874.09 E:0.104783 |  A clearing header now. Calafiore, pace across, block.
[5018.96 - 5020.52] P:1787.01 E:0.095312 |  Will go straight up in the air.
[5020.52 - 5023.20] P:1763.20 E:0.098511 |  Vivian gives Garosarba a shout.
[5023.20 - 5027.48] P:1809.94 E:0.095523 |  Garosarba ducks. Vivian volleys the ball away.
[5027.60 - 5032.08] P:1694.19 E:0.099758 |  And Arsenal are about to bring Leandro Trossard into the game.
[5032.08 - 5034.88] P:1656.25 E:0.109016 |  He's taken a big slug of water from a bottle,
[5034.88 - 5039.40] P:1695.99 E:0.088755 |  as Mikael Arter has his left arm around the Belgian shoulder.
[5039.40 - 5041.80] P:1610.83 E:0.106865 |  Gives him the last instructions in his shell-like,
[5041.80 - 5044.28] P:1737.97 E:0.125170 |  and then gives his hair a good old ruffle for good measure.
[5044.28 - 5047.72] P:1789.80 E:0.102327 |  Timber, that was a foul on Sam Thet, but advantage play.
[5047.72 - 5050.24] P:1750.95 E:0.094504 |  Gomez is all on his own here, for athletics,
[5050.24 - 5052.04] P:1893.03 E:0.110758 |  so he's just got to hold onto the ball,
[5052.04 - 5054.52] P:1933.64 E:0.116043 |  keeps possession, plays back into his own half, 0-0.
[5054.52 - 5057.04] P:1842.15 E:0.104792 |  Look sharp, Gomez, since he's come on on this left-hand side,
[5057.08 - 5059.92] P:1636.13 E:0.101438 |  in place of Navarro. Navarro tended to drift inside a lot.
[5059.92 - 5062.60] P:1679.60 E:0.112514 |  But Gomez has come on defensively, as it shirks his duties,
[5062.60 - 5064.28] P:1607.67 E:0.109339 |  made one or two good tackles.
[5064.28 - 5066.72] P:1605.28 E:0.109672 |  His first thought every single time is to get past Timber.
[5066.72 - 5069.28] P:1594.04 E:0.080385 |  This caused Timber a problem since he's come on the field.
[5069.28 - 5072.96] P:1620.31 E:0.085524 |  PSV, Niel, Union, Sanjilwa, 2.
[5072.96 - 5076.00] P:1603.20 E:0.101595 |  Tottenham Villareal commentary on the way this evening at 8 o'clock.
[5076.00 - 5079.28] P:1516.07 E:0.101050 |  Tomorrow night we're in Munich, for Bayern Munich against Chelsea.
[5079.28 - 5082.28] P:1482.24 E:0.092477 |  We'll have updates on Liverpool, Atletico.
[5082.28 - 5086.36] P:1544.23 E:0.093560 |  The highlight show, BBC One, tomorrow night at 10.40.
[5086.36 - 5088.56] P:1559.11 E:0.094004 |  And BBC Two, 11 o'clock, where they have highlights
[5088.56 - 5090.96] P:1421.91 E:0.106429 |  in Newcastle, Barcelona and Manchester City, Napoli,
[5090.96 - 5094.12] P:1696.37 E:0.112516 |  both of which you can hear as commentaries on the BBC's sounds.
[5094.12 - 5096.44] P:1877.08 E:0.122781 |  Newcastle on five-lie.
[5097.16 - 5100.04] P:1798.62 E:0.101569 |  And Manchester City on the sports extra.
[5100.04 - 5102.24] P:1714.14 E:0.098040 |  Good chasing down the left by Yorcarez.
[5102.24 - 5104.56] P:1671.30 E:0.098462 |  Again, Tylus Workpool to win a throw in for Arsenal.
[5104.56 - 5106.24] P:1822.09 E:0.101600 |  I really like what I see with Yorcarez.
[5106.24 - 5108.52] P:1874.47 E:0.090986 |  I think he'll be a real asset to Arsenal this season.
[5108.52 - 5111.52] P:1899.03 E:0.097569 |  I've already scored his goals, like I said, three and four this season.
[5111.52 - 5112.52] P:1866.89 E:0.125842 |  Got that head injury, though.
[5112.52 - 5114.56] P:1889.58 E:0.087936 |  It's looking like that might be his last act to the evening.
[5114.56 - 5116.28] P:1862.46 E:0.084414 |  Yeah, Yorcarez coming off.
[5116.28 - 5117.68] P:1783.67 E:0.080249 |  Just had the attendance in.
[5117.68 - 5120.32] P:1858.33 E:0.083522 |  Just over 51,000.
[5120.32 - 5123.92] P:1721.64 E:0.104681 |  2,700 Arsenal fans up high, away to our right.
[5123.92 - 5125.60] P:1752.30 E:0.069078 |  Yorcarez off.
[5125.60 - 5129.40] P:1756.77 E:0.099057 |  Trossard on for Arsenal with 25 minutes left to play.
[5129.40 - 5132.40] P:1636.56 E:0.085841 |  Game is still 0-0.
[5132.40 - 5136.04] P:1548.39 E:0.090137 |  Giant banner was unfilled before the game.
[5136.04 - 5138.04] P:1631.76 E:0.099785 |  Written in big block capitals in Spanish,
[5138.04 - 5140.68] P:1589.42 E:0.086835 |  which our producer, George, thankfully,
[5140.68 - 5142.08] P:1609.59 E:0.112808 |  had translated for me.
[5142.08 - 5143.48] P:1480.45 E:0.099702 |  Has it taken him this long?
[5143.52 - 5145.48] P:1638.71 E:0.113007 |  Just 16 runs to the get.
[5145.48 - 5147.24] P:1570.94 E:0.084290 |  Throw into the near post now. That's unfair.
[5147.24 - 5149.24] P:1511.28 E:0.080562 |  He passed it to me right at the start.
[5149.24 - 5151.12] P:1779.13 E:0.109637 |  Marino is going to chase the ball here in the penalty area.
[5151.12 - 5152.64] P:1631.40 E:0.065026 |  Parade is nipped in.
[5152.64 - 5154.72] P:1742.50 E:0.096251 |  What a really important header for Athletic.
[5154.72 - 5156.72] P:1736.26 E:0.097643 |  It's cleared away an out for an Arsenal throw.
[5156.72 - 5162.88] P:1613.27 E:0.086376 |  It just read, we will be by your side until the last day.
[5162.88 - 5167.52] P:1498.20 E:0.095147 |  And that drop down from in between those two tears away to our left.
[5167.52 - 5170.40] P:1743.71 E:0.104210 |  Another couple of changes coming for Athletic.
[5170.40 - 5171.96] P:1692.89 E:0.105850 |  But here are Arsenal with Ezzar.
[5171.96 - 5173.40] P:1640.99 E:0.091208 |  Ezzar stands the ball up to the far left.
[5173.44 - 5175.76] P:1838.64 E:0.100186 |  Marino's header, Seymour makes the say.
[5175.76 - 5176.96] P:1903.83 E:0.114298 |  Marino was stretching.
[5176.96 - 5179.72] P:1761.18 E:0.082508 |  He was trying to direct it back to where it was coming from.
[5179.72 - 5181.40] P:1555.17 E:0.083814 |  Couldn't get the power or the placement.
[5181.40 - 5182.60] P:1641.45 E:0.096975 |  It's half a chance for Arsenal.
[5182.60 - 5184.52] P:1532.72 E:0.093163 |  It's a ball from the left-hand side from Ezzar.
[5184.52 - 5187.92] P:1784.32 E:0.098788 |  First time he's really got round his fullback and attacked his fullback in the game.
[5187.92 - 5188.92] P:1735.90 E:0.112559 |  Stands up a good cross.
[5188.92 - 5191.08] P:1739.16 E:0.103014 |  It's just a little bit behind Marino.
[5191.08 - 5194.16] P:1827.32 E:0.095686 |  Stretching, reaching, but managed to get some kind of purchase on it.
[5194.16 - 5196.32] P:1863.51 E:0.097114 |  But harmlessly into the goalkeeper's arms.
[5196.32 - 5198.48] P:1593.79 E:0.084682 |  Athletic, nil.
[5198.48 - 5201.60] P:1795.74 E:0.100968 |  Arsenal, nil in the Champions League.
[5201.64 - 5203.32] P:1808.72 E:0.107567 |  And the Ackie Williams, chess it down.
[5203.32 - 5205.36] P:1700.58 E:0.091466 |  Plays back into his own half to Vivian.
[5205.36 - 5207.52] P:1516.78 E:0.084506 |  Vivian again on the ball.
[5207.52 - 5210.80] P:1670.61 E:0.095877 |  Rolls his pass low to Paredes, the other centre-back.
[5210.80 - 5214.24] P:1724.91 E:0.096031 |  Back to the goalkeeper, Seymour, and all in light orange.
[5214.24 - 5215.32] P:1671.01 E:0.102715 |  Timber heads it away.
[5215.32 - 5219.12] P:1764.53 E:0.086846 |  McWakie, flicks the head around the corner for Marino to chase.
[5219.12 - 5223.32] P:1768.60 E:0.102049 |  Marino then has to block that pass forward down the left-hand side from Paredes.
[5223.32 - 5224.80] P:1734.20 E:0.108055 |  And it goes out for a throw.
[5224.80 - 5230.44] P:1647.39 E:0.080583 |  So, striker Gorka Gurutheta is about to come on
[5230.44 - 5232.56] P:1700.73 E:0.080100 |  for Athletic Bill Bauer.
[5232.56 - 5236.24] P:1600.92 E:0.082453 |  And also left-back Yuri Berchicce.
[5236.24 - 5237.52] P:1507.74 E:0.108943 |  Surprised he didn't start, actually.
[5237.52 - 5239.12] P:1491.96 E:0.102895 |  Berchicce is a real attacking threat.
[5239.12 - 5242.04] P:1602.80 E:0.081038 |  I think that might be what the manager's thinking.
[5242.04 - 5244.56] P:1675.17 E:0.082702 |  Throw in for Athletic.
[5244.56 - 5246.56] P:1522.64 E:0.097218 |  Gomez flicks the header behind him.
[5246.56 - 5248.76] P:1458.58 E:0.099364 |  Mosquera is there for Arsenal.
[5248.76 - 5251.76] P:1689.74 E:0.097896 |  Christian Norgaard, by the way, is on the bench for Arsenal tonight.
[5251.76 - 5258.92] P:1836.37 E:0.077611 |  Yet to feature for the club since joining from Brentford in the summer.
[5258.92 - 5262.04] P:1916.46 E:0.106072 |  And Pierre-Oim Capier, as well, yet to make his debut.
[5262.04 - 5266.16] P:1832.79 E:0.093512 |  The Ecuadorian defender was on loan from Bayer Leibicouz.
[5266.16 - 5269.32] P:1758.61 E:0.094513 |  And he is also on the bench this evening.
[5269.32 - 5274.96] P:1875.91 E:0.092043 |  Timber carries the ball up to the halfway line for Arsenal.
[5274.96 - 5280.08] P:1868.75 E:0.101880 |  Back to Zubemendi, passes it to Mosquera across to Gabrielle.
[5280.08 - 5282.80] P:1815.76 E:0.113667 |  Gabrielle trucks forward.
[5282.80 - 5284.24] P:1915.35 E:0.105403 |  Garen Gair gets in his way.
[5284.24 - 5288.44] P:1795.07 E:0.095617 |  And Gavriel panicked a little bit there, just sort of ran into Garen Gair.
[5288.48 - 5289.76] P:1789.13 E:0.090327 |  And found him.
[5289.76 - 5291.00] P:1737.07 E:0.103592 |  And that's going to be a free kick.
[5291.00 - 5294.36] P:1771.70 E:0.100612 |  It's either a free kick for Athletic or a throw in on the right.
[5294.36 - 5295.88] P:1866.50 E:0.109047 |  Gabrielle certainly had the last touch.
[5295.88 - 5298.24] P:1873.04 E:0.102125 |  Right, change is coming.
[5298.24 - 5304.72] P:1881.79 E:0.110554 |  Oyan Santhet, attacking midfielder is coming off to be replaced by Gurutheta.
[5304.72 - 5306.68] P:1844.64 E:0.109692 |  And the other change is left back for left back.
[5306.68 - 5309.84] P:1897.36 E:0.106832 |  So yes, Boyro comes off, who started the seedling.
[5309.84 - 5313.12] P:1899.98 E:0.107812 |  And Berchicce comes on.
[5313.12 - 5314.52] P:1818.14 E:0.128210 |  The interesting to see what he does now,
[5314.52 - 5317.20] P:1903.29 E:0.106960 |  because I think this will be a little bit of a shuffle of the puck.
[5317.24 - 5320.32] P:1819.76 E:0.121763 |  Garen Gair has played as a number nine alongside Williams.
[5322.12 - 5325.44] P:1775.98 E:0.085674 |  You know what the home fans think of that immediately.
[5325.44 - 5329.20] P:1767.62 E:0.080850 |  Gurutheta goes up there.
[5329.20 - 5331.60] P:1741.03 E:0.093761 |  Straight down the middle, just having a quick look now.
[5331.60 - 5333.04] P:1755.76 E:0.092108 |  So Berchicce has gone to the right.
[5333.04 - 5334.60] P:1696.84 E:0.096530 |  Garen Gair off him, you think, maybe.
[5334.60 - 5336.60] P:1679.16 E:0.094002 |  Yeah, Garen Gair's playing in the number 10 role.
[5336.60 - 5338.68] P:1681.51 E:0.095904 |  Williams out to the right.
[5338.68 - 5340.32] P:1694.64 E:0.095700 |  And Gomez on the left-hand side.
[5340.32 - 5341.76] P:1784.30 E:0.080070 |  Slight change in formation.
[5341.76 - 5343.52] P:1567.34 E:0.105868 |  Mosquera wins a header on the halfway line.
[5343.52 - 5344.72] P:1748.37 E:0.114330 |  Marino's pass for his block.
[5344.72 - 5346.92] P:1753.10 E:0.101384 |  Garen Gair in that number 10 role onto the ball quickly.
[5346.96 - 5348.24] P:1733.18 E:0.093825 |  He finds in the Acce Williams.
[5348.24 - 5350.04] P:1706.91 E:0.092065 |  He's got Calafuri backpedaling.
[5350.04 - 5351.44] P:1745.41 E:0.106047 |  Turns to his left, then to his right.
[5351.44 - 5353.72] P:1661.47 E:0.095771 |  Calafuri sticks out a leg, tries to block the cross.
[5353.72 - 5355.80] P:1691.35 E:0.100267 |  Headed away by Gabrielle.
[5355.80 - 5358.44] P:1695.20 E:0.110404 |  Howard-Aguitha outnumbered on the edge of the box.
[5358.44 - 5361.00] P:1684.91 E:0.095930 |  Ezra and Calafuri player 1-2 back to Ezra.
[5361.00 - 5363.60] P:1711.08 E:0.093275 |  He's lost it. Trossard steps in.
[5363.60 - 5365.84] P:1720.95 E:0.121981 |  Trossard dribbling into danger.
[5365.84 - 5367.64] P:1723.55 E:0.111755 |  Definitely fouled on the edge of the box.
[5367.64 - 5368.92] P:1777.73 E:0.093862 |  Referee spotted that.
[5368.92 - 5370.16] P:1841.21 E:0.100280 |  Will be a free kick.
[5370.16 - 5372.64] P:1690.53 E:0.090986 |  And the Acce Williams hits the shot anyway.
[5372.64 - 5375.00] P:1703.31 E:0.095728 |  And Raya tips it over the bar, but Arstel get the free kick.
[5375.04 - 5377.32] P:1690.20 E:0.103909 |  So Marino for Arstel now.
[5377.32 - 5379.28] P:1890.83 E:0.095675 |  Further forward, Paul with Trossard.
[5381.76 - 5382.92] P:1818.39 E:0.121061 |  Sort of midfield.
[5382.92 - 5384.24] P:1751.89 E:0.121860 |  Dropped away in behind.
[5384.24 - 5386.72] P:1820.25 E:0.087408 |  Trossard will be slightly more advanced than Marino.
[5386.72 - 5388.68] P:1803.61 E:0.102821 |  Well, Trossard at the moment is going to receive treatment
[5388.68 - 5390.64] P:1813.82 E:0.083030 |  on the edge of his own 18-yard box.
[5390.64 - 5391.96] P:1786.21 E:0.102599 |  They've interchanged.
[5391.96 - 5394.44] P:1780.61 E:0.090160 |  It's kind of a false nine, really, isn't it?
[5394.44 - 5397.24] P:1832.03 E:0.093427 |  I mean, you see Marino now, he's anchoring in that midfield role.
[5397.24 - 5400.12] P:1909.11 E:0.091542 |  So when Trossard does get up, he'll be the most advanced player.
[5400.12 - 5403.00] P:1911.58 E:0.097428 |  But the interesting one, the changes from Ernesto Valverde,
[5403.00 - 5404.52] P:1816.45 E:0.068136 |  the athletic manager.
[5404.56 - 5407.12] P:1866.58 E:0.107466 |  You look at their draw, he's thinking, right, it's nil-nil here.
[5407.12 - 5409.96] P:1826.75 E:0.078085 |  I've got 20 minutes to go. Throw caution to the wind.
[5409.96 - 5413.00] P:1794.47 E:0.088864 |  This home form could be important to get out the league base.
[5413.00 - 5414.68] P:1732.00 E:0.079182 |  I mean, they've got PSG at home.
[5414.68 - 5415.84] P:1714.76 E:0.090176 |  They go to Dortmund.
[5415.84 - 5417.84] P:1755.30 E:0.093893 |  They've got Atlanta, Atlanta away.
[5417.84 - 5419.00] P:1905.22 E:0.096430 |  They play sport in here.
[5419.00 - 5420.44] P:1900.55 E:0.082749 |  They go to Slavia Prague.
[5420.44 - 5421.60] P:1794.81 E:0.092847 |  They've got Karabag at home.
[5421.60 - 5423.24] P:1753.28 E:0.096566 |  And then they go to St James's Park.
[5423.24 - 5425.64] P:1705.73 E:0.100535 |  So this form here and getting the result here,
[5425.64 - 5427.40] P:1767.83 E:0.107924 |  I think he's going for three points here.
[5427.40 - 5429.48] P:1727.61 E:0.091808 |  Beringa and Gomez just make a bit of a mess
[5429.48 - 5431.84] P:1863.28 E:0.103538 |  of an attacking opportunity for Athletic there.
[5431.84 - 5433.44] P:1981.50 E:0.117355 |  The ball is back with Raya.
[5433.48 - 5436.88] P:1833.33 E:0.083436 |  Raya saw the pass and then whips it perfectly into the feet of Timber.
[5436.88 - 5438.76] P:1857.67 E:0.097156 |  Timber's in the right back position.
[5438.76 - 5440.68] P:1911.98 E:0.093406 |  Plays further back to Mosquera.
[5440.68 - 5442.56] P:1870.89 E:0.102990 |  Mosquera's done really well for Arsenal.
[5442.56 - 5445.64] P:1841.85 E:0.094123 |  21 years old, first appearance in the Champions League,
[5445.64 - 5447.56] P:1807.47 E:0.093700 |  has settled in very nicely.
[5447.56 - 5448.96] P:1605.71 E:0.099481 |  Having signed from Valencia.
[5448.96 - 5452.24] P:1597.55 E:0.094344 |  Rice carries the ball forward to the halfway line.
[5452.24 - 5453.36] P:1589.82 E:0.126567 |  Chips it down the left.
[5453.36 - 5455.16] P:1593.71 E:0.095738 |  Nearly a mess up on the edge of the penalty area
[5455.16 - 5456.60] P:1496.74 E:0.108967 |  between Seaman and Paredes.
[5456.60 - 5458.92] P:1622.38 E:0.101978 |  Paredes sliding in, clears the ball away.
[5458.92 - 5460.72] P:1711.13 E:0.093441 |  Arsenal come again with Ezzer.
[5460.72 - 5462.12] P:1616.87 E:0.092911 |  They'll drop with the shoulder.
[5462.16 - 5463.68] P:1783.11 E:0.083304 |  Glides past a couple of defenders.
[5463.68 - 5465.88] P:1840.53 E:0.098799 |  Still going, Ezzer feeds it forward to Trossard.
[5465.88 - 5469.48] P:1828.54 E:0.100682 |  Trossard edge of the area, trying to wriggle into space to tee himself up
[5469.48 - 5472.28] P:1815.98 E:0.103924 |  for a shot and the referee's given a free kick against him
[5472.28 - 5474.44] P:1883.92 E:0.089775 |  for an arm which has come out
[5474.44 - 5477.68] P:1751.41 E:0.086282 |  and caught one of the Athletic players, Vivian, in the face.
[5477.68 - 5478.68] P:1456.99 E:0.092993 |  He's clever, Vivian.
[5478.68 - 5480.32] P:1650.33 E:0.087401 |  He's an experienced defender.
[5480.32 - 5483.08] P:1798.80 E:0.093340 |  26-year-old Spaniard knows exactly what he's doing.
[5483.08 - 5484.68] P:1833.12 E:0.099588 |  Trossard looked like he'd got the better of him.
[5484.68 - 5485.88] P:1902.41 E:0.085801 |  There was a flailing arm.
[5485.88 - 5488.52] P:1806.40 E:0.077381 |  Vivian made it look a lot worse than it was.
[5488.52 - 5489.96] P:1778.27 E:0.102981 |  Right, another change coming for Arsenal.
[5490.00 - 5491.28] P:1691.87 E:0.080756 |  Ezzer coming off.
[5491.28 - 5492.84] P:1806.34 E:0.073719 |  20 minutes to play.
[5492.84 - 5495.12] P:1765.76 E:0.087548 |  First Champions League game for him.
[5495.12 - 5497.28] P:1820.29 E:0.090104 |  Never really got into it this evening.
[5497.28 - 5498.36] P:1747.34 E:0.095275 |  It is going to take a bit of time.
[5498.36 - 5500.24] P:1815.68 E:0.084908 |  Looks slightly frustrated as he comes off.
[5500.24 - 5501.28] P:1781.50 E:0.099979 |  Martin Ellie comes off.
[5501.28 - 5502.60] P:1749.44 E:0.098052 |  I'm not surprised with that change.
[5502.60 - 5504.24] P:1679.72 E:0.085344 |  I think he's been poor tonight, Ezzer.
[5504.24 - 5506.84] P:1677.93 E:0.101601 |  He's come inside far too much
[5506.84 - 5509.24] P:1752.80 E:0.101244 |  rather than taking on this fallback, getting around the outside,
[5509.24 - 5510.92] P:1638.14 E:0.087313 |  putting crosses into the box.
[5510.92 - 5512.56] P:1735.51 E:0.103474 |  I think it's been a quiet game for him.
[5512.56 - 5514.96] P:1825.23 E:0.103354 |  They've played a lot dominantly down the right-hand side
[5514.96 - 5517.16] P:1848.76 E:0.095887 |  because of the quality of Madu Ecke.
[5517.16 - 5518.84] P:1778.04 E:0.112911 |  All the reaction to tonight's football
[5518.84 - 5521.96] P:1751.57 E:0.099963 |  in the Football Daily podcast for you later on this evening.
[5522.96 - 5524.52] P:1548.88 E:0.112137 |  There for your first thing every morning.
[5524.52 - 5526.56] P:1715.76 E:0.105483 |  BBC Sounds app Trossard flicks it forward.
[5526.56 - 5528.32] P:1836.88 E:0.089567 |  Martin Ellie first touch, heads it down.
[5528.32 - 5530.48] P:1692.52 E:0.117828 |  Oh, brings it on. Martin Ellie, clean through on goal.
[5530.48 - 5532.56] P:1880.91 E:0.101082 |  One-on-one, right footed under the keeper.
[5532.56 - 5536.88] P:1696.95 E:0.101484 |  And Martin Ellie is on and scores immediate impact
[5536.88 - 5538.76] P:1561.43 E:0.104815 |  from the Arsenal substitute.
[5538.76 - 5540.72] P:1609.63 E:0.105740 |  He had the pace to get away,
[5540.72 - 5542.68] P:1676.65 E:0.105281 |  but he had the cool head as well
[5542.68 - 5544.64] P:1605.85 E:0.093327 |  when the chance presented itself.
[5544.64 - 5547.00] P:1592.65 E:0.106090 |  Slid it under the keeper with his right foot.
[5547.04 - 5550.64] P:1625.49 E:0.101174 |  And Arsenal's Champions League campaign is up and running.
[5550.64 - 5553.16] P:1721.91 E:0.099206 |  Athletic Bill Balneal, Arsenal won.
[5553.16 - 5554.88] P:1728.11 E:0.099077 |  Well, there he is, the super-sup.
[5554.88 - 5558.60] P:1666.62 E:0.103821 |  Miquel Arteta, you can praise him for his proactive change there.
[5558.60 - 5561.40] P:1736.14 E:0.119375 |  Martin Ellie with his first touches of the game.
[5561.40 - 5564.68] P:1674.33 E:0.114620 |  Runs through from midway and through the opposition's half.
[5564.68 - 5566.12] P:1696.90 E:0.118802 |  Goes through one-on-one with the goalkeeper.
[5566.12 - 5569.76] P:1665.05 E:0.099313 |  It's not the most convincing of attempts to save it from Simon.
[5569.76 - 5571.88] P:1679.45 E:0.102406 |  Goes underneath the athletic goalkeeper,
[5571.88 - 5573.32] P:1644.51 E:0.104820 |  but it's brilliant from Arsenal.
[5573.32 - 5576.12] P:1679.58 E:0.106757 |  It's a simple ball over the top into Martin Ellie.
[5576.16 - 5579.04] P:1741.35 E:0.100350 |  His first touch is good. His second touch is even better.
[5579.04 - 5582.36] P:1688.53 E:0.110806 |  Comes from an athletic goal kick that's headed back down the field.
[5582.36 - 5584.84] P:1821.20 E:0.111796 |  Arsenal turned defence into attack with two headers,
[5584.84 - 5586.24] P:1767.69 E:0.109073 |  helped over the top.
[5587.40 - 5591.76] P:1796.29 E:0.112669 |  Really quick thinking by Drossard into the path of Martin Ellie.
[5591.76 - 5594.48] P:1702.13 E:0.117078 |  His second touch is absolutely superb.
[5594.48 - 5597.40] P:1719.55 E:0.113196 |  Takes it away from the unrushing defenders, opens himself up,
[5597.40 - 5599.56] P:1778.98 E:0.106899 |  almost telegraphs it with his right foot.
[5599.56 - 5601.08] P:1833.26 E:0.106265 |  Looks to go across Simon.
[5601.08 - 5602.36] P:1726.93 E:0.111388 |  It's not the greatest of finishes.
[5602.36 - 5605.36] P:1654.20 E:0.104584 |  It goes right underneath the goalkeeper, but he won't care.
[5606.76 - 5609.16] P:1677.29 E:0.102834 |  Talking about squad strength and options, Paul,
[5609.16 - 5611.68] P:1656.91 E:0.102284 |  Ezra off, Martin Ellie on, they offer different things.
[5611.68 - 5613.68] P:1668.97 E:0.099493 |  Martin Ellie has that quick silver pace,
[5613.68 - 5615.40] P:1664.08 E:0.091101 |  and he was perfect for that situation.
[5615.40 - 5618.12] P:1761.54 E:0.102291 |  He was so sharp, so quick alert to the situation,
[5618.12 - 5620.28] P:1568.96 E:0.105002 |  and you've got to give him a lot of credit for being that ready
[5620.28 - 5621.40] P:1763.95 E:0.088972 |  coming off the bench.
[5621.40 - 5624.04] P:1757.61 E:0.099291 |  That wasn't just a snapshot, a goal with his first touch.
[5624.04 - 5626.24] P:1814.10 E:0.100174 |  That was two touches on the halfway line,
[5626.24 - 5628.36] P:1723.60 E:0.098351 |  a run half a length of the field and a finish.
[5628.36 - 5630.48] P:1704.78 E:0.108018 |  Superb attitude to come off the bench and do that.
[5630.48 - 5632.04] P:1508.58 E:0.110359 |  Yeah, under pressure from the defender as well,
[5632.04 - 5634.64] P:1654.95 E:0.106323 |  and he very nearly with one of the touches didn't get it past him,
[5634.64 - 5637.88] P:1633.91 E:0.098461 |  but kept his head and just managed to squeeze the shot
[5637.88 - 5640.28] P:1523.14 E:0.099994 |  under the body of Unai Simon.
[5640.28 - 5642.76] P:1632.44 E:0.101013 |  First goal of the season for Gabrielle Martin Ellie,
[5642.76 - 5645.36] P:1917.31 E:0.095868 |  as it stands Arsenal heading for three points
[5645.36 - 5649.96] P:2019.49 E:0.105505 |  in their first Champions League outing of the season.
[5649.96 - 5653.04] P:1919.19 E:0.109243 |  As I said at the start as well, only three English teams,
[5653.04 - 5655.60] P:1950.77 E:0.089074 |  two English teams have beg your pardon,
[5655.60 - 5659.88] P:1847.34 E:0.094193 |  but one in Bilbao against Athletic in European competition,
[5659.88 - 5664.24] P:1823.70 E:0.103145 |  Manchester United last season, 3-0, Europa League semi-final.
[5664.28 - 5666.48] P:1955.11 E:0.112813 |  And that great Liverpool team back in the early 80s,
[5666.48 - 5667.88] P:1831.15 E:0.102402 |  so Arsenal trying to become the third.
[5667.88 - 5672.00] P:1798.29 E:0.093250 |  Gabrielle to Cala Fiori, intercepted by Garas Sable.
[5672.00 - 5674.80] P:1889.95 E:0.108907 |  Athletic really have to come at Arsenal now,
[5674.80 - 5679.68] P:1711.96 E:0.104389 |  which may open further opportunities for Michel Arteta's team.
[5679.68 - 5681.68] P:1648.15 E:0.110939 |  Paredes in the centre circle,
[5681.68 - 5683.28] P:1709.22 E:0.097771 |  lofted ball down the middle of the pitch,
[5683.28 - 5685.44] P:1686.54 E:0.096361 |  bounces once inside the Arsenal area,
[5685.44 - 5687.52] P:1737.79 E:0.100062 |  and David Ryder chests it down.
[5687.52 - 5689.60] P:1787.37 E:0.095999 |  So just over 15 minutes to play,
[5689.60 - 5691.84] P:1767.08 E:0.100927 |  Athletic Bill Barnell, Arsenal won,
[5691.88 - 5695.76] P:1794.36 E:0.093942 |  and O'Neill Sanjianouar still turning up away to PSV Eindhoven.
[5695.76 - 5698.44] P:1901.54 E:0.113697 |  It's not been the most fluid and the most prettiest of performances,
[5698.44 - 5702.52] P:1899.90 E:0.099664 |  but it's been a job well done at the moment for Michel Arteta in his Arsenal team.
[5702.52 - 5705.96] P:1730.64 E:0.093201 |  You can see the way that they set up, they battled and they scrapped in the first half,
[5705.96 - 5707.92] P:1854.02 E:0.089638 |  they saw it through, they've kept a clean sheet,
[5707.92 - 5709.36] P:1707.67 E:0.106042 |  they've got their goal away from home,
[5709.36 - 5711.64] P:1742.29 E:0.085501 |  and as you say now, Athletic have got to come out,
[5711.64 - 5713.92] P:1705.22 E:0.106064 |  and that might suit Arsenal with the pace that they've got on the pitch
[5713.92 - 5717.56] P:1764.10 E:0.099495 |  and Martin Ellie, Trossard and Maddoeki especially on this right-hand side.
[5717.56 - 5720.32] P:1752.92 E:0.102233 |  At the moment, it's a typical away performance, isn't it?
[5720.36 - 5722.76] P:1679.40 E:0.105129 |  Sends an extra urgency for Athletic Bill Barnell.
[5722.76 - 5725.36] P:1687.42 E:0.097626 |  Don't forget Arsenal have only conceded the one goal so far this season,
[5725.36 - 5727.28] P:1636.61 E:0.093660 |  that was the stunning Sobberslide three-kick,
[5727.28 - 5729.60] P:1742.62 E:0.103140 |  but that's a foul I think by Moskera,
[5731.04 - 5733.36] P:1700.72 E:0.105073 |  inside the Athletic Bill Barnell half,
[5733.36 - 5735.96] P:1648.13 E:0.098902 |  eager to win the ball back to get Arsenal on the front foot,
[5735.96 - 5739.36] P:1637.59 E:0.092068 |  but he's just been a little too enthusiastic in the challenge,
[5739.36 - 5741.76] P:1533.96 E:0.091115 |  so that'll be a free kick.
[5741.76 - 5744.40] P:1617.66 E:0.091953 |  So just about 15 minutes to play,
[5744.40 - 5747.08] P:1625.92 E:0.098725 |  Arsenal are one up in a course,
[5747.12 - 5749.52] P:1641.29 E:0.093465 |  their next game, home against Manchester City,
[5749.52 - 5753.52] P:1491.03 E:0.097457 |  massive game on Sunday, we've got commentary of it on Five Live,
[5753.52 - 5756.52] P:1645.60 E:0.107522 |  and BBC Sound, I'll let it Bill Barnell get the game underway again.
[5756.52 - 5760.36] P:1504.07 E:0.078897 |  Paul Robinson here, in the San Mames,
[5760.36 - 5762.28] P:1525.38 E:0.104425 |  watching with us has got a sabre,
[5762.28 - 5764.68] P:1472.76 E:0.078987 |  stocky little right back,
[5764.68 - 5767.56] P:1576.78 E:0.093517 |  four Athletic, plays it back to Vivian,
[5767.56 - 5770.24] P:1495.70 E:0.086700 |  into the midfield, Vesca back to the goalkeeper,
[5770.24 - 5773.56] P:1575.06 E:0.090096 |  Simon, Simon chips it down the middle of the pitch,
[5773.56 - 5774.88] P:1645.06 E:0.099279 |  Gabrielle wins the header,
[5774.88 - 5779.16] P:1761.35 E:0.105097 |  and he's got the pace again, nearly gets there ahead of Khaled Agatha,
[5779.16 - 5780.84] P:1755.72 E:0.110097 |  he did well to bump him off the ball,
[5780.84 - 5783.12] P:1729.36 E:0.107537 |  and also plays a good pass down the right and got a sabre,
[5783.12 - 5785.40] P:1705.25 E:0.097412 |  the right back is flying forward, danger for Arsenal here,
[5785.40 - 5787.80] P:1809.41 E:0.105978 |  Calafiore shuts it down, gets his body in the way,
[5787.80 - 5789.76] P:1871.97 E:0.093374 |  makes the block, throw in for Athletic.
[5789.76 - 5792.60] P:1628.70 E:0.102686 |  Defended very well in those areas, Arsenal, Calafiore that time,
[5792.60 - 5794.92] P:1626.61 E:0.103777 |  they do took in narrows a back ball when they're at possession,
[5794.92 - 5797.64] P:1699.42 E:0.111864 |  but when the need to, Calafiore reads the game really well,
[5797.64 - 5800.04] P:1783.20 E:0.099645 |  goes out to the full, that closes the ball down,
[5800.04 - 5803.16] P:1728.26 E:0.099653 |  and makes the block, it's about concentration now for Arsenal,
[5803.24 - 5804.68] P:1652.92 E:0.086906 |  seeing the job through.
[5804.68 - 5806.84] P:1662.55 E:0.106463 |  David Reyes' goal has not really come under much threat,
[5806.84 - 5809.12] P:1410.60 E:0.073225 |  defensively they've been very good.
[5809.12 - 5811.04] P:1563.22 E:0.095126 |  Throw in now that Arsenal have to defend,
[5811.04 - 5813.24] P:1539.00 E:0.104911 |  aim towards the penalty spot, Gabrielle heads it away,
[5813.24 - 5814.76] P:1768.77 E:0.099172 |  right footed shot is driven low,
[5814.76 - 5818.88] P:1580.32 E:0.088747 |  Marino makes the block, played back there by Guruthayton,
[5818.88 - 5820.00] P:1549.55 E:0.098424 |  other cross comes into the area,
[5820.00 - 5821.64] P:1643.82 E:0.101972 |  header from Gomez, straight at Ryder,
[5821.64 - 5823.76] P:1795.84 E:0.087005 |  easy save, clash of heads again,
[5823.76 - 5825.52] P:1641.26 E:0.103181 |  we're going to get another stoppage in play,
[5825.52 - 5828.20] P:1632.23 E:0.100023 |  Athletic Bill Bowneal, Arsenal won,
[5828.20 - 5832.40] P:1593.12 E:0.090193 |  and David Ryder is trying to get the medical staff
[5832.44 - 5834.88] P:1715.50 E:0.095929 |  to hurry up here, since there's some urgency there,
[5834.88 - 5836.28] P:1560.13 E:0.107264 |  Marino is there, more blood?
[5837.28 - 5838.40] P:1623.17 E:0.097530 |  Not sure.
[5838.40 - 5839.92] P:1741.81 E:0.107802 |  Still waiting on the blood camp,
[5839.92 - 5841.68] P:1765.32 E:0.085844 |  it's not zoomed in enough yet,
[5841.68 - 5844.80] P:1537.87 E:0.093848 |  but they were pretty adamant to get the doctors and physios on,
[5844.80 - 5846.68] P:1771.90 E:0.074000 |  look to nasty clash of heads,
[5846.68 - 5848.60] P:1728.56 E:0.101619 |  but again it's good defending from Arsenal,
[5848.60 - 5850.20] P:1511.66 E:0.088405 |  yes there's been a header on the goal,
[5850.20 - 5853.32] P:1532.53 E:0.094544 |  but the header on goal has come from 16-17 yards out,
[5853.32 - 5855.88] P:1581.56 E:0.092883 |  the cross came into the box, didn't really have any pace on it,
[5855.88 - 5859.04] P:1692.96 E:0.087448 |  the header came in and it's just a simple catch for David Reyes,
[5859.04 - 5861.80] P:1572.50 E:0.090521 |  it was an opportunity, it was a chance,
[5861.80 - 5863.04] P:1622.98 E:0.079826 |  but it's from distance,
[5863.04 - 5865.68] P:1660.02 E:0.110908 |  I mean I could still catch a ball from a header from that distance,
[5865.68 - 5866.88] P:1854.93 E:0.103405 |  now I fancy the chances.
[5866.88 - 5868.88] P:1832.53 E:0.100527 |  While we wait for the players to receive treatment here,
[5868.88 - 5871.84] P:1692.04 E:0.097329 |  Paul, just talk to me about Simon and the goal he conceded,
[5871.84 - 5873.12] P:1609.35 E:0.095849 |  Spain's number one there,
[5873.12 - 5875.48] P:1529.29 E:0.097589 |  Martinelli is racing through in the one-on-one,
[5875.48 - 5878.72] P:1730.07 E:0.091118 |  and it's one where you look at it, it's quite close to him,
[5878.72 - 5881.64] P:1724.72 E:0.099342 |  but it sort of sneaks underneath him between left hand and left leg,
[5881.64 - 5883.64] P:1519.38 E:0.096889 |  is that an awkward one where that ended up for him?
[5883.64 - 5885.32] P:1449.82 E:0.095846 |  That's exactly what we talk about all the time, don't we?
[5885.32 - 5887.64] P:1628.42 E:0.089154 |  We talk about it quite often when goal's going,
[5887.64 - 5889.84] P:1559.39 E:0.093199 |  just down by the side of goalkeeper's feet,
[5889.88 - 5893.28] P:1608.30 E:0.089213 |  I mean we see a lot of goalkeepers now making blocks with their feet,
[5893.28 - 5895.32] P:1453.19 E:0.093213 |  and that's something that they practice in training,
[5895.32 - 5896.64] P:1479.10 E:0.101728 |  something that we never used to practice,
[5896.64 - 5898.96] P:1564.12 E:0.090321 |  it was always get down, get your hands to it,
[5898.96 - 5902.72] P:1574.18 E:0.096764 |  and your natural instinct as a goalkeeper is to get down, get your hands to it,
[5902.72 - 5906.52] P:1649.22 E:0.094890 |  but actually when you talk to strikers and you listen to strikers in the way that they're coached,
[5906.52 - 5907.84] P:1587.47 E:0.091216 |  that's the place that they look.
[5907.84 - 5910.68] P:1516.14 E:0.098000 |  Now I don't think for one minute that's what Martinelli meant to do,
[5910.68 - 5913.24] P:1544.99 E:0.094221 |  because he opened himself up and looked to go around Simon,
[5913.24 - 5916.20] P:1757.72 E:0.086606 |  he actually didn't quite get his shot and it went right in between,
[5916.20 - 5917.40] P:1746.96 E:0.105323 |  well you can imagine yourself standing,
[5917.40 - 5919.68] P:1531.59 E:0.090699 |  if you want to put your left hand down on the ground,
[5919.72 - 5922.48] P:1705.67 E:0.102909 |  between your foot and the ground, that's exactly where the ball went through.
[5922.48 - 5926.48] P:1833.16 E:0.100648 |  Difficult place, but the goalkeeper could have made it easier just by booting the ball away,
[5926.48 - 5929.52] P:1778.49 E:0.088115 |  but that's technically not what you taught and technically not correct.
[5930.32 - 5935.44] P:1766.32 E:0.099309 |  So the athletic Bill Bow player who took a whack to the head here is up and on his feet,
[5936.08 - 5945.24] P:1875.19 E:0.093020 |  and he's holding a bandage addressing a cover, a white cover to his left cheek,
[5945.68 - 5949.92] P:1875.39 E:0.103464 |  that is the substitute Unaid Gomez who's slowly making his way back towards the half way line
[5949.92 - 5952.96] P:1861.33 E:0.090093 |  to try and get himself back into the action when we get back under way.
[5952.96 - 5957.68] P:1902.35 E:0.095847 |  Marino, slightly concerningly for Arsenal, is still flat on his back,
[5957.68 - 5962.52] P:1883.56 E:0.089867 |  I mean he's not out cold because he's been talking to the Arsenal medical staff
[5962.52 - 5964.84] P:1723.11 E:0.093246 |  and they're now hauling him up into a sitting position,
[5964.84 - 5967.00] P:1712.89 E:0.092975 |  but they've been taking their time quite rightly as well,
[5967.00 - 5969.00] P:1741.60 E:0.084287 |  any clasher heads, any banger heads.
[5969.00 - 5970.80] P:1552.01 E:0.111316 |  Just getting to look at the incident again,
[5970.80 - 5974.44] P:1703.27 E:0.108316 |  it was Marino who was going forward onto the ball, substitute Gomez was in front of him,
[5974.44 - 5977.16] P:1932.08 E:0.099205 |  he tried to flick it on, but as he flipped it on,
[5977.16 - 5981.24] P:2012.41 E:0.112618 |  Marino got the whole load of blonde hair and head right in front of his nose and teeth,
[5981.24 - 5982.72] P:2005.63 E:0.106735 |  painful one for Marino.
[5983.64 - 5988.36] P:1967.46 E:0.101002 |  Right, 12 minutes left of this game, plus a fair bit of added time now,
[5988.36 - 5991.80] P:1905.14 E:0.093505 |  Marino's OK, up and moving for Arsenal,
[5991.80 - 5998.04] P:1742.11 E:0.095376 |  he is now just breaking into a gentle jog down behind the dead ball line away to our left,
[5998.04 - 5999.64] P:1825.03 E:0.098165 |  David Ryder has the ball at his feet,
[5999.64 - 6002.08] P:1855.09 E:0.095509 |  Oonion Sanjiraba third goal,
[6002.12 - 6005.64] P:1683.95 E:0.097851 |  debuting the Champions League away from home in their first game,
[6005.64 - 6007.64] P:1742.14 E:0.102457 |  and they're 3-0 up the way to PSV,
[6007.64 - 6010.60] P:1698.66 E:0.089345 |  we've got commentary of Tottenham VRAL to come tonight,
[6010.60 - 6012.44] P:1756.25 E:0.092283 |  from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium,
[6012.44 - 6015.72] P:1569.90 E:0.099138 |  and we'll keep you updated on Ray on the grid at home to Marseille,
[6015.72 - 6018.72] P:1559.21 E:0.095716 |  the event is at home to Borussia Dortmund and Benfica,
[6018.72 - 6019.92] P:1750.90 E:0.117509 |  Houston Karabag,
[6019.92 - 6021.76] P:1778.27 E:0.105433 |  Unai Gomez is going to have to come off,
[6021.76 - 6024.40] P:1663.83 E:0.091900 |  so he walked back towards the half-way line,
[6024.40 - 6026.20] P:1535.16 E:0.099518 |  he's gone and sat straight down in the dugout,
[6026.20 - 6028.64] P:1498.80 E:0.091345 |  Athletic are about to make a couple of changes here,
[6028.64 - 6030.92] P:1493.86 E:0.098210 |  I can see Sub's getting ready to go,
[6030.92 - 6033.52] P:1461.46 E:0.087648 |  one of them is Alejandro Rego,
[6033.52 - 6035.44] P:1549.08 E:0.104611 |  the other one is Nico Serrano,
[6035.44 - 6036.56] P:1690.54 E:0.096942 |  here's Iñaki Williams,
[6036.56 - 6039.24] P:1638.36 E:0.098256 |  tries something very audacious from the angle,
[6039.24 - 6041.96] P:1797.19 E:0.104829 |  30 yards out and has accidentally kicked Califiore,
[6041.96 - 6045.16] P:1832.49 E:0.103033 |  and now Iñaki Williams claims that Califiore is making a meal of it,
[6045.16 - 6047.60] P:1725.48 E:0.071463 |  and Arsenal are trying to run the clock down,
[6047.60 - 6049.08] P:1669.49 E:0.109893 |  Califiore does seem in some pain,
[6049.08 - 6051.76] P:1899.01 E:0.107972 |  the referee doesn't seem too fussed about it,
[6051.76 - 6053.80] P:2090.14 E:0.117513 |  he's telling Ryder just to stay where you are,
[6053.80 - 6056.76] P:2053.40 E:0.096016 |  keep the ball, come on let's get this game going again,
[6056.76 - 6059.20] P:1964.47 E:0.099561 |  and Athletic wait to make the double change,
[6059.20 - 6061.04] P:1716.71 E:0.106942 |  but this is what it's all about as well isn't it Paul,
[6061.04 - 6063.68] P:1834.95 E:0.098805 |  you know Michel Arteta was asked a lot of this last night,
[6063.68 - 6065.16] P:1985.47 E:0.107753 |  about the experience,
[6065.16 - 6067.08] P:1931.15 E:0.108072 |  and Pep Guardiola always said that about Manchester City
[6067.08 - 6067.92] P:1937.36 E:0.103345 |  and the Champions League,
[6067.92 - 6070.48] P:1888.97 E:0.111755 |  you have to have season after season after season,
[6070.48 - 6073.24] P:1900.18 E:0.110011 |  of experience, of these stadiums, of these trips,
[6073.24 - 6074.28] P:1927.36 E:0.105779 |  of these big games,
[6074.28 - 6076.52] P:1851.84 E:0.105126 |  as Athletic make one of these changes right now,
[6076.52 - 6078.64] P:1889.48 E:0.096966 |  so Gomez is coming off,
[6078.64 - 6082.20] P:1822.04 E:0.094539 |  is already off receiving treatment in the dugout,
[6082.20 - 6088.04] P:1747.49 E:0.097719 |  and Vesga is the other one to come off Serrano and Rego,
[6088.40 - 6089.76] P:1847.22 E:0.097709 |  but that's what they were asking Paul about,
[6089.76 - 6091.56] P:1975.28 E:0.087690 |  the experience Arsenal have,
[6091.56 - 6093.84] P:1965.62 E:0.093934 |  and the strength and depth they now have,
[6093.84 - 6096.84] P:1903.50 E:0.094792 |  where effectively lost and they sort of ran out of players almost.
[6096.84 - 6099.40] P:1774.23 E:0.101525 |  And this is the first Champions League game of the season,
[6099.40 - 6101.20] P:1675.07 E:0.095006 |  this is something that they're going to have to manage
[6101.20 - 6102.64] P:1705.38 E:0.086641 |  throughout the whole season,
[6102.64 - 6104.44] P:1745.50 E:0.100777 |  competing on both fronts as we've seen,
[6104.44 - 6105.76] P:1785.70 E:0.084137 |  we've seen them fall away,
[6105.76 - 6107.52] P:1765.59 E:0.095625 |  both in Europe and domestically,
[6107.52 - 6109.00] P:1586.33 E:0.097615 |  and that's it now for Michel Arteta,
[6109.00 - 6111.32] P:1873.11 E:0.094883 |  it's become the time where you've had the summer,
[6111.32 - 6113.32] P:1927.19 E:0.092247 |  you've spent 250 million,
[6113.32 - 6114.60] P:1965.95 E:0.107750 |  you look at the players that you brought in,
[6114.60 - 6116.88] P:1879.58 E:0.087317 |  you've got two players in every single position,
[6116.88 - 6118.20] P:1652.71 E:0.110854 |  now the time for potential,
[6118.20 - 6120.88] P:1922.22 E:0.095227 |  it's time to turn that expectation and potential
[6120.88 - 6122.36] P:1992.90 E:0.109090 |  into actually delivering something,
[6122.36 - 6124.20] P:1905.15 E:0.087610 |  and you say the experience and everything
[6124.20 - 6126.12] P:1846.25 E:0.105123 |  will stand these players in great stead,
[6126.12 - 6127.76] P:1978.57 E:0.110323 |  it's come into places like this,
[6127.76 - 6128.68] P:2026.00 E:0.109279 |  it might not be pretty,
[6128.68 - 6130.84] P:2021.52 E:0.097880 |  this hasn't been the best ever Arsenal performance,
[6130.84 - 6132.36] P:2084.21 E:0.099625 |  but you're looking at the score sheet,
[6132.36 - 6133.84] P:1970.83 E:0.095336 |  there's no pitches on the score sheet,
[6133.84 - 6136.00] P:1984.11 E:0.103118 |  it says 1-0 and at the moment they've got three points.
[6136.00 - 6139.60] P:1688.18 E:0.079171 |  Martin Ali's goal in the 72nd minute, David Ryder,
[6139.60 - 6141.72] P:1806.76 E:0.090275 |  clears the ball downfield from the free kick,
[6141.72 - 6142.80] P:1576.52 E:0.099820 |  Trossard wins the header,
[6142.80 - 6144.12] P:1515.81 E:0.110219 |  volleyed away by Parades,
[6144.12 - 6145.32] P:1765.10 E:0.097635 |  and Jacqui-Williams will chase that,
[6145.32 - 6147.00] P:1791.15 E:0.107354 |  Mosquera heads it back towards Ryder,
[6147.00 - 6149.56] P:1770.19 E:0.090393 |  Ryder's not really there yet to come racing across
[6149.56 - 6150.64] P:1523.44 E:0.103967 |  from the left-hand side of the field,
[6150.64 - 6152.20] P:1588.26 E:0.107771 |  got there, slices the clearance away,
[6152.20 - 6154.16] P:1639.16 E:0.091623 |  that was brought down brilliantly by Beringer,
[6154.16 - 6155.40] P:1680.44 E:0.078405 |  knocks it past Timber,
[6155.40 - 6157.16] P:1714.14 E:0.084115 |  Timber will beat him to the ball,
[6157.16 - 6158.68] P:1811.45 E:0.106182 |  and play it back to Mosquera again,
[6158.68 - 6161.04] P:1937.85 E:0.093558 |  Mosquera, edge of his own penalty area,
[6161.04 - 6162.72] P:1870.49 E:0.089787 |  never flustered, Trossard tries to turn it quickly
[6162.72 - 6164.28] P:1862.71 E:0.098169 |  around the corner, runs to Madwake,
[6164.28 - 6166.56] P:1781.04 E:0.077903 |  Madwake keeps the ball in play,
[6166.56 - 6168.92] P:1749.51 E:0.112037 |  but can't find his teammate Zuba Mendi,
[6168.92 - 6172.52] P:1644.20 E:0.106161 |  and Danny Vivian passes back to Unai Simon,
[6172.52 - 6174.80] P:1729.08 E:0.100047 |  80s references all over the place this evening,
[6174.80 - 6176.12] P:1565.91 E:0.108070 |  Ounion Sanshiloise,
[6176.12 - 6178.80] P:1732.40 E:0.090771 |  third goal has been scored by Kevin McAllister,
[6178.80 - 6179.92] P:1807.70 E:0.097170 |  brother of Alexis,
[6179.92 - 6183.64] P:1803.69 E:0.096135 |  producer George Wright's not a home-alone character,
[6183.64 - 6185.76] P:1839.20 E:0.098222 |  good line by that George,
[6185.76 - 6188.32] P:1546.40 E:0.087104 |  eight minutes plus, that is time remaining,
[6188.32 - 6191.20] P:1671.52 E:0.095206 |  Arsenal leading 1-0, Beringer,
[6192.48 - 6194.08] P:1713.05 E:0.092815 |  holding off Marino,
[6194.08 - 6196.16] P:1677.15 E:0.108323 |  Bericiccio plays the ball down the left-hand side,
[6196.16 - 6199.24] P:1771.75 E:0.099500 |  Beringer, all over the back of Mosquera,
[6199.24 - 6200.84] P:1736.85 E:0.091586 |  wrestles him to the floor,
[6200.84 - 6202.36] P:1843.11 E:0.105114 |  that is going to be a free kick for Arsenal,
[6202.36 - 6203.16] P:1789.37 E:0.114837 |  and you can see now,
[6203.20 - 6205.20] P:1663.08 E:0.087563 |  the athletic Bill Bowes players are getting frustrated,
[6205.20 - 6206.84] P:1581.95 E:0.085641 |  desperately trying to make something happen,
[6206.84 - 6208.72] P:1660.32 E:0.091461 |  and Arsenal are just killing the game.
[6208.72 - 6210.64] P:1576.27 E:0.107820 |  He's going to be a good player, you know, that Mosquera,
[6210.64 - 6212.64] P:1890.85 E:0.111358 |  he's going to be a really astute sign,
[6212.64 - 6215.68] P:2010.31 E:0.116757 |  21 years old, I think he'll have to pay for him 15 million,
[6215.68 - 6218.72] P:2007.45 E:0.103514 |  but I think he's going to be a really clever, clever acquisition,
[6218.72 - 6220.80] P:1820.48 E:0.094166 |  sitting in there like he's played there for years,
[6220.80 - 6222.44] P:1768.66 E:0.094227 |  alongside Gabriel this evening,
[6222.44 - 6224.92] P:1844.36 E:0.094443 |  looks very experienced, and just that incident there,
[6224.92 - 6227.56] P:1697.54 E:0.102763 |  running the game down, knowing when and where to win a free kick,
[6227.56 - 6229.56] P:1751.37 E:0.090888 |  slow the game down, and break the play-up.
[6230.56 - 6231.88] P:1750.73 E:0.118537 |  Trossard's down on the floor,
[6231.88 - 6235.08] P:1717.91 E:0.092343 |  challenging for a high ball inside the athletic half,
[6235.08 - 6236.44] P:1653.40 E:0.105938 |  goes back into the Arsenal half,
[6236.44 - 6239.36] P:1651.09 E:0.093633 |  Ryre is there, 10 yards outside his penalty area,
[6239.36 - 6241.36] P:1572.82 E:0.098051 |  long spinning clearance downfield,
[6241.36 - 6243.36] P:1642.69 E:0.090261 |  headed away over the head of Madwake,
[6244.36 - 6246.84] P:1680.77 E:0.099879 |  Altezza looking slightly anxious there,
[6246.84 - 6248.76] P:1629.85 E:0.116423 |  pleased with the challenge from Merino to win the ball,
[6248.76 - 6250.28] P:1650.13 E:0.088183 |  lovely pass for the outside of his left foot,
[6250.28 - 6252.68] P:1798.78 E:0.097428 |  to find Trossard, who looked for the early cross to the far post,
[6252.68 - 6256.48] P:1870.57 E:0.094606 |  towards Martinelli, blocked, and behind it goes for the corner,
[6256.48 - 6258.28] P:1846.93 E:0.084770 |  league cup commentaries tonight,
[6258.28 - 6261.36] P:1649.92 E:0.091885 |  so in 15 minutes time, Sheffield, Wednesday Grimsby,
[6261.36 - 6264.36] P:1699.57 E:0.084507 |  gets underway on Sports Extra, 8 o'clock kick-offs,
[6264.36 - 6266.76] P:1698.85 E:0.089302 |  Brentford Villa is on Sports Extra 2,

[6270.36 - 6271.48] P:1719.89 E:0.116727 |  and if you're enjoying the coverage
[6271.48 - 6273.16] P:1732.07 E:0.105309 |  on the World Athletics Championships,
[6273.16 - 6279.76] P:1841.87 E:0.109035 |  big race tomorrow, 2.20, will come into five live live from Tokyo,
[6279.76 - 6282.68] P:2019.34 E:0.113022 |  the men's 1500 metre final, three bricks in that,
[6282.68 - 6285.44] P:2134.43 E:0.107581 |  Josh Kerr, Jake Whiteman, and Neil Gauley,
[6286.80 - 6289.92] P:2009.55 E:0.122156 |  World Athletics on BBC Two from 11 in the morning,
[6289.92 - 6293.36] P:2014.21 E:0.117545 |  and then in the afternoon on BBC One from 2 o'clock.
[6294.36 - 6296.88] P:1937.07 E:0.104780 |  Athletic fans now, oh, Yellow Card,
[6296.88 - 6299.08] P:1721.80 E:0.095881 |  for Madwake was it for Deleu, in the take-in of the corner?
[6299.08 - 6301.12] P:1806.39 E:0.088918 |  I think it's Madwake who's been booked there.
[6302.12 - 6304.32] P:1851.99 E:0.111048 |  Now waits to take the corner away to our right,
[6304.32 - 6306.84] P:1893.51 E:0.106992 |  referee's still not happy, because he's spotted some pushing
[6306.84 - 6311.16] P:1974.48 E:0.091168 |  and shoving from young Moschera inside the six-yard box,
[6311.16 - 6313.12] P:1736.30 E:0.113353 |  Arsenal happy with the time ticking away,
[6313.12 - 6315.40] P:1900.61 E:0.110921 |  six minutes plus added time to go,
[6315.40 - 6318.44] P:1786.80 E:0.095159 |  now Madwake takes it with his left foot into the far post,
[6318.48 - 6321.20] P:1612.72 E:0.098168 |  Gabrielle's down inside the box, not before by Supermendi,
[6321.20 - 6324.16] P:1669.14 E:0.097006 |  Calafiori has a strike at the ball, didn't get much on it,
[6324.16 - 6327.44] P:1819.92 E:0.113862 |  break on for Athletic, and here's the man they want to have
[6327.44 - 6329.12] P:1713.55 E:0.113378 |  the ball as well, it's Iñaki Williams,
[6329.12 - 6331.68] P:1743.66 E:0.100779 |  moving at high speed down the inside left channel,
[6331.68 - 6334.28] P:1762.79 E:0.101586 |  infield onto his right foot, the ball hits the back of Supermendi,
[6334.28 - 6336.32] P:1728.22 E:0.100840 |  Bettinger turns, but turns into trouble,
[6336.32 - 6339.92] P:1789.41 E:0.089144 |  Declan Rice strides away, imposing figure,
[6339.92 - 6342.00] P:1780.67 E:0.122775 |  chased by Haudegy through, holds him up,
[6342.00 - 6344.80] P:1860.18 E:0.118627 |  Rice holds him up, the referee says that's actually a foul
[6344.80 - 6347.88] P:1934.31 E:0.105188 |  on Declan Rice, and Arsenal celebrate the award
[6348.60 - 6350.72] P:1989.30 E:0.125652 |  The locals are not happy with that decision,
[6350.72 - 6352.16] P:2041.59 E:0.116472 |  do you know what, you can kind of understand it,
[6352.16 - 6355.32] P:2081.60 E:0.110940 |  because the referees let things similar go,
[6355.32 - 6357.12] P:2094.20 E:0.097334 |  what Arsenal players have committed,
[6357.12 - 6358.60] P:2055.16 E:0.115470 |  and actually they're deep in his own half,
[6358.60 - 6361.16] P:2054.95 E:0.091628 |  Declan Rice knew what he was doing, drew the foul,
[6361.16 - 6363.16] P:1983.99 E:0.086691 |  referee immediately gave the free kick,
[6363.16 - 6366.20] P:1921.26 E:0.090532 |  home support there, as you can hear, felt that they should
[6366.20 - 6369.04] P:1947.26 E:0.106246 |  have potentially had more free kicks for similar offenses,
[6369.04 - 6370.00] P:2044.05 E:0.075386 |  let's say.
[6370.00 - 6373.40] P:2033.77 E:0.101292 |  Paul Robinson here with us in Bilbao, tomorrow night,
[6373.40 - 6375.80] P:2066.59 E:0.095121 |  it's Ian Dennis and Pat Nevin in Munich,
[6375.84 - 6377.28] P:2019.71 E:0.101343 |  but by Munich against Chelsea,
[6377.28 - 6380.32] P:1935.93 E:0.081949 |  updates of Liverpool, Atletico, Thursday night,
[6380.32 - 6382.12] P:1792.30 E:0.094117 |  where it's St. James' Park on five life,
[6382.12 - 6384.36] P:1754.51 E:0.085340 |  full commentary of Newcastle Barcelona,
[6384.36 - 6386.36] P:1618.68 E:0.107268 |  Manchester City Napoli on sports extra,
[6386.36 - 6389.60] P:1742.13 E:0.084467 |  Ryder thumps it downfield with his right foot,
[6389.60 - 6391.32] P:1594.00 E:0.107796 |  got a sabre, sort of leans into the ball,
[6391.32 - 6393.52] P:1774.95 E:0.090552 |  gets the touch there, has to keep it in play,
[6395.16 - 6398.68] P:1785.13 E:0.098784 |  clearance on the turn, ends up spinning away here to Timber,
[6398.68 - 6400.20] P:1601.04 E:0.106134 |  Timber brings it forward for Arsenal,
[6400.20 - 6401.20] P:1730.32 E:0.086500 |  is able to get his head up,
[6401.20 - 6403.84] P:1685.55 E:0.088734 |  Trossard was in a bit of space there, he's annoyed,
[6403.88 - 6405.16] P:1563.33 E:0.103791 |  Timber didn't deliver that cross,
[6405.16 - 6407.40] P:1618.08 E:0.111499 |  because Trossard felt he was in a good position,
[6407.40 - 6411.28] P:1511.65 E:0.089445 |  clever little nutmeg from Madueke, takes him past
[6411.28 - 6414.40] P:1646.35 E:0.091625 |  Bercice, back it comes to Zubemendi,
[6414.40 - 6416.40] P:1580.04 E:0.112069 |  Zubemendi passes back to the halfway line,
[6416.40 - 6417.88] P:1704.08 E:0.103063 |  Arsenal happy to keep the ball at the moment,
[6417.88 - 6420.36] P:1769.16 E:0.113685 |  leading one-nil, Martinelli's goal,
[6420.36 - 6422.96] P:1604.51 E:0.098778 |  he'd only been on the pitch for about a minute or so,
[6422.96 - 6425.76] P:1593.74 E:0.099695 |  having replaced Ezzer, and it was Trossard's clever little
[6425.76 - 6427.72] P:1485.72 E:0.090375 |  ball forward from the halfway line,
[6427.72 - 6429.24] P:1704.58 E:0.129822 |  that got Martinelli racing away,
[6429.24 - 6430.56] P:1782.20 E:0.116588 |  definite foul from Zubemendi,
[6430.56 - 6432.36] P:1860.13 E:0.093865 |  I'm surprised the rest are not giving that,
[6432.36 - 6434.12] P:1920.85 E:0.104498 |  I know he's going to let that go,
[6434.12 - 6435.96] P:1930.10 E:0.110366 |  there was another foul on Marino after that,
[6435.96 - 6438.28] P:1937.81 E:0.102040 |  but anyway Arsenal have it now with Martinelli,
[6438.28 - 6439.68] P:2018.17 E:0.107928 |  and Martinelli's moving at speed,
[6439.68 - 6441.88] P:1832.25 E:0.098568 |  takes on Garasable, beats him into the penalty area,
[6441.88 - 6444.00] P:1850.69 E:0.089345 |  looks for the cutback, Trossard controls,
[6444.00 - 6446.80] P:1733.40 E:0.096358 |  Dummies the shot deflected, and in!
[6446.80 - 6449.76] P:1720.76 E:0.107362 |  And that will be an Arsenal winning Bill Bow,
[6449.76 - 6453.28] P:1770.13 E:0.104837 |  a massive win at the start of this Champions League campaign,
[6453.28 - 6455.72] P:1888.84 E:0.104020 |  and it's another substitute that has done it
[6455.72 - 6458.80] P:1926.80 E:0.095108 |  for Mikkel Arteta, deflected shot,
[6458.80 - 6461.96] P:1964.28 E:0.099243 |  high into the net, athletic Bill Bow-nil,
[6461.96 - 6463.28] P:2004.00 E:0.091553 |  and Arsenal too!
[6463.28 - 6465.72] P:2019.91 E:0.104884 |  All three points heading back to London tonight,
[6465.72 - 6467.32] P:2039.64 E:0.101054 |  good play again by the substitutes,
[6467.32 - 6470.20] P:2044.69 E:0.106975 |  and it's Martinelli that's absolutely superb
[6470.20 - 6471.52] P:1982.07 E:0.093028 |  down that left-hand side,
[6471.52 - 6472.68] P:2081.66 E:0.112022 |  immediately you get it,
[6472.68 - 6474.52] P:2070.90 E:0.117057 |  his first thought is to go forward,
[6474.52 - 6477.08] P:2056.79 E:0.117349 |  they are going to check on VAR to see if there's any infringements
[6477.08 - 6478.56] P:2078.00 E:0.118832 |  in the build-up, as you can hear,
[6478.56 - 6480.64] P:2072.51 E:0.121590 |  the home fans are on the back of the referee,
[6480.64 - 6482.88] P:2146.89 E:0.116803 |  the home players are all surrounding the referee,
[6482.88 - 6484.52] P:2175.10 E:0.113926 |  but it looks at the moment that Trossard
[6484.52 - 6486.04] P:2191.19 E:0.103737 |  has put this game out of reach.
[6486.04 - 6487.56] P:2309.16 E:0.111942 |  The only thing I can see there, Paul,
[6487.56 - 6488.80] P:2225.61 E:0.103041 |  and we mentioned it in the commentary,
[6488.80 - 6491.88] P:2119.79 E:0.097639 |  was Zubemendi's challenge on the halfway line,
[6491.92 - 6493.28] P:2098.81 E:0.110092 |  that is way back,
[6493.28 - 6495.36] P:2088.91 E:0.100347 |  they always talk about the attacking phase of play,
[6495.36 - 6498.32] P:2081.22 E:0.093504 |  where has it started, is that crucial before Arsenal scored the goal?
[6498.32 - 6500.68] P:2040.79 E:0.102298 |  Well, yes, to my mind, because that's how they get the ball.
[6500.68 - 6502.32] P:2056.79 E:0.103742 |  Here's the challenge on the halfway line,
[6502.32 - 6505.08] P:2009.20 E:0.099040 |  at the time I thought that was a foul from Zubemendi,
[6505.08 - 6507.76] P:2003.03 E:0.112005 |  the assistant referee is close, but maybe not actually.
[6507.76 - 6509.00] P:2049.14 E:0.092336 |  No, there's not a lot in that,
[6509.00 - 6510.28] P:2039.56 E:0.114911 |  I think that's a very harsh foul,
[6510.28 - 6511.76] P:2053.79 E:0.081082 |  if that's given as a foul,
[6511.76 - 6514.40] P:2005.99 E:0.110056 |  referee sees the incident, puts his arm in the air and says,
[6514.40 - 6517.20] P:2040.69 E:0.099748 |  no, carry on, there's no way that's going to get given as a foul,
[6517.20 - 6519.44] P:1925.67 E:0.086839 |  I think the athletic player made a lot of it,
[6519.44 - 6520.84] P:1876.30 E:0.105525 |  Zubemendi, there was contact,
[6520.88 - 6522.16] P:1842.99 E:0.079357 |  but after that what ensued,
[6522.16 - 6524.80] P:1769.20 E:0.102884 |  Arsenal was swift, precise, down the left-hand side,
[6524.80 - 6527.08] P:1886.50 E:0.097623 |  Martinelli absolutely superb again,
[6527.08 - 6528.24] P:1920.40 E:0.112105 |  pulled it back to Trossard,
[6528.24 - 6529.44] P:2009.38 E:0.106566 |  first touch was brilliant,
[6529.44 - 6531.64] P:2017.05 E:0.110281 |  second touch was the finish and the goal stands.
[6532.32 - 6533.76] P:2040.11 E:0.106717 |  By rightly the goal stands,
[6533.76 - 6536.36] P:1948.41 E:0.094856 |  Leandro Trossard gets his first of the season,
[6536.36 - 6537.92] P:1748.61 E:0.107080 |  as does Gabrielle Martinelli,
[6537.92 - 6541.40] P:1673.69 E:0.087721 |  and again we make the point about the Arsenal squad strength.
[6541.40 - 6543.56] P:1796.12 E:0.094061 |  Ball loose in the Arsenal box,
[6543.56 - 6545.64] P:1855.89 E:0.108995 |  89th minute of the game now,
[6545.64 - 6548.36] P:1958.50 E:0.095098 |  Arsenal are home and hosed, it looks like,
[6548.36 - 6549.76] P:1822.34 E:0.092619 |  2-0 up and...
[6550.40 - 6552.00] P:1828.28 E:0.108742 |  You know, it has been a tricky fixture tonight,
[6552.00 - 6553.36] P:1872.85 E:0.106258 |  it always looked that way,
[6554.52 - 6556.32] P:1722.34 E:0.112346 |  right at the start of the campaign,
[6556.32 - 6559.80] P:1634.09 E:0.105337 |  six English teams in the Champions League league phase,
[6559.80 - 6561.32] P:1684.06 E:0.093830 |  five Spanish teams,
[6561.32 - 6563.68] P:1506.35 E:0.098409 |  loads of Premier League against La Liga,
[6563.68 - 6565.64] P:1362.80 E:0.100082 |  got another one tonight, Tottenham Villareal,
[6565.64 - 6567.88] P:1298.88 E:0.095384 |  tomorrow of course Liverpool, Atletico,
[6567.88 - 6569.84] P:1522.58 E:0.110162 |  and Thursday Newcastle Barcelona,
[6569.84 - 6572.84] P:1501.87 E:0.092785 |  but Arsenal look like they've put this game to bed,
[6572.84 - 6575.36] P:1645.20 E:0.112705 |  they're going to make a couple of late changes as well.
[6575.36 - 6577.92] P:1779.59 E:0.099127 |  Athletics still battling, here's Berengear,
[6577.92 - 6579.40] P:1621.34 E:0.096048 |  little ball to Inaki Williams,
[6579.44 - 6580.92] P:1767.00 E:0.092196 |  edge of the penalty, lays it back,
[6580.92 - 6583.48] P:1762.09 E:0.122354 |  Howard Aguilther, was he caught by Trossard?
[6583.48 - 6587.36] P:1812.79 E:0.105949 |  No, no contact, Howard Aguilther threw himself to the floor,
[6587.36 - 6588.80] P:1832.27 E:0.108601 |  in which case that was simulation,
[6588.80 - 6591.56] P:1727.28 E:0.094732 |  then he dives in, makes a tackle, it runs to Timber,
[6591.56 - 6593.52] P:1713.59 E:0.091518 |  Timber clears it, man awake, he might get there first,
[6593.52 - 6594.72] P:1685.23 E:0.079894 |  he doesn't quite,
[6594.72 - 6597.48] P:1811.58 E:0.093527 |  Mikhail Vateta furiously waving his Arsenal players
[6597.48 - 6600.12] P:1766.01 E:0.101722 |  in the blue shirts back to defend, he wants this clean sheet,
[6600.12 - 6602.60] P:1652.93 E:0.097956 |  he doesn't want any late drama, Arsenal under pressure,
[6602.60 - 6606.24] P:1792.09 E:0.092974 |  Cross comes in, Ryder jumps and makes a confident, easy claim.
[6606.24 - 6607.24] P:1740.43 E:0.122629 |  I'll tell you what, I hope the referee
[6607.28 - 6609.28] P:1790.59 E:0.105590 |  haven't got any holidays coming up in Bilbao,
[6609.28 - 6610.68] P:1821.70 E:0.102336 |  because he certainly won't be welcome back,
[6610.68 - 6612.68] P:1848.52 E:0.091537 |  he'll do well to get out of the stadium tonight.
[6612.68 - 6614.12] P:1907.20 E:0.098079 |  Rice does well for Arsenal,
[6614.12 - 6615.64] P:1828.26 E:0.092162 |  though he doesn't, his pass is given away,
[6615.64 - 6618.00] P:1633.78 E:0.087973 |  that's a wonderful bit of control there from Gooder Fagter,
[6618.00 - 6619.48] P:1637.87 E:0.102762 |  plays the ball to the right-hand side,
[6619.48 - 6621.24] P:1686.66 E:0.106878 |  Berengear tries to get a low crossing,
[6621.24 - 6624.08] P:1614.09 E:0.102985 |  Trossard back there for Arsenal, great bit of defending,
[6624.08 - 6627.24] P:1780.36 E:0.116440 |  and then he is fouled by Nico Serrano,
[6627.24 - 6629.24] P:1849.96 E:0.097136 |  and the Athletic fans again, they don't like it,
[6629.24 - 6630.68] P:1902.84 E:0.097292 |  they think Trossard has bought that,
[6630.68 - 6631.96] P:1808.80 E:0.100604 |  but what he's done is he's stopped,
[6631.96 - 6634.24] P:1790.34 E:0.084080 |  he's waited for the contact when it comes,
[6634.24 - 6635.52] P:1865.18 E:0.085156 |  they're always giving us free kicks.
[6635.52 - 6637.52] P:1627.32 E:0.096274 |  Yeah, it's clever play, it's called running the clock down,
[6637.52 - 6640.00] P:1614.86 E:0.096045 |  running the game down, it's been away from home,
[6640.00 - 6642.00] P:1752.42 E:0.093398 |  and a Champions League game in 2-0 up,
[6642.00 - 6645.00] P:1794.78 E:0.091182 |  heading towards the 90th minute, it's good game management.
[6645.00 - 6647.52] P:1785.22 E:0.101241 |  And I think the thing that you look at Arsenal's performance tonight
[6647.52 - 6650.00] P:1840.75 E:0.103352 |  is that's maybe the difference of what we've seen in recent years,
[6650.00 - 6652.00] P:1811.15 E:0.097003 |  they've found a way and they've got over the line,
[6652.00 - 6654.52] P:1828.38 E:0.097596 |  whereas if this game had gone by and were interviewing
[6654.52 - 6656.52] P:1783.36 E:0.100775 |  Michele Arthetto at the end of the game and it was 0-0,
[6656.52 - 6658.00] P:1701.80 E:0.082249 |  I don't think he could have had any complaints
[6658.00 - 6660.52] P:1806.66 E:0.098482 |  without the real creativity, without any real spark.
[6660.52 - 6663.52] P:1737.58 E:0.091202 |  If this game had finished 0-0, I don't think we'd have been surprised,
[6663.52 - 6665.52] P:1869.79 E:0.092586 |  but actually the substitutions that he made,
[6665.52 - 6669.52] P:1817.58 E:0.094561 |  the pro-activist that he showed, bringing on Martin and he bringing on Trossard,
[6669.52 - 6672.52] P:1830.53 E:0.091767 |  and at that stage in the game, sensing he could make a difference,
[6672.52 - 6674.52] P:1783.55 E:0.095396 |  you've got to give him a lot of credit because that has,
[6674.52 - 6676.52] P:1803.42 E:0.096249 |  it's changed the game, it's won the game.
[6676.52 - 6679.52] P:1765.08 E:0.100736 |  He will be absolutely delighted, loads of his family in here this evening,
[6679.52 - 6682.52] P:1646.15 E:0.101015 |  the family home about an hour away from here,
[6682.52 - 6685.52] P:1595.51 E:0.087786 |  Michele Arthetto born in San Sebastián,
[6685.52 - 6687.52] P:1508.67 E:0.092176 |  basketball, of course, could have played,
[6687.52 - 6690.52] P:1663.22 E:0.105617 |  qualified to play for Athletic Bill Bow,
[6690.52 - 6692.52] P:1804.43 E:0.117004 |  but here he is as the opposition manager,
[6692.52 - 6694.52] P:1796.78 E:0.108584 |  and Arsenal are going to come away with a win,
[6694.52 - 6697.52] P:1683.94 E:0.098310 |  Yellow Card given to Zuba Mendi for delaying the restart of the game,
[6697.52 - 6701.52] P:1691.59 E:0.098158 |  double change for Arsenal, two debuts, two late debuts in this game for Arsenal,
[6701.52 - 6705.52] P:1703.80 E:0.097243 |  in Capier and Norgard, Christian Norgard are both on,
[6705.52 - 6709.52] P:1633.63 E:0.087026 |  Califiori and Madueke with the two players to come off,
[6709.52 - 6711.52] P:1421.19 E:0.096925 |  and let's repeat before the final whistle blows,
[6711.52 - 6714.52] P:1516.99 E:0.085956 |  because I'm pretty sure that Arsenal are going to get this win.
[6714.52 - 6716.52] P:1520.99 E:0.108748 |  Six minutes about in time to be played though,
[6716.52 - 6719.52] P:1627.41 E:0.109483 |  Flickon bounces inside the Arsenal area, Naki Williams sticks a foot out,
[6719.52 - 6723.52] P:1625.61 E:0.092707 |  didn't get the touch he wanted, and Ryder is able to bend down and pick the ball up,
[6723.52 - 6728.52] P:1610.20 E:0.089531 |  they are going to become the first team in the history of the European Cup Champions League
[6728.52 - 6732.52] P:1641.99 E:0.099211 |  to beat Spanish opposition six games in a row,
[6732.52 - 6737.52] P:1529.31 E:0.100281 |  and when you consider how many good teams there have been down the years in this competition,
[6737.52 - 6741.52] P:1669.90 E:0.084627 |  it's a quirk, a quirk is assisted, but still it's impressive,
[6741.52 - 6743.52] P:1613.07 E:0.110356 |  and here they come again, Arsenal, and this is Norgard,
[6743.52 - 6747.52] P:1663.26 E:0.102126 |  first touches the ball as an Arsenal player, driving run down the right hand side,
[6747.52 - 6750.52] P:1653.12 E:0.093195 |  looking to get the cross in, two defenders there, it's blocked,
[6750.52 - 6753.52] P:1536.56 E:0.087100 |  but Norgard has managed to keep it, plays it back to Rice,
[6753.52 - 6757.52] P:1567.94 E:0.102309 |  four and a half minutes to play, Arsenal leading 2-0, Timber,
[6757.52 - 6761.52] P:1557.54 E:0.100980 |  chased down here by the substitute Rago, Timber holds him off,
[6761.52 - 6766.52] P:1634.68 E:0.097439 |  plays back to Mosquera, Mosquera, a couple of touches just short of the halfway line on the right,
[6766.52 - 6768.52] P:1537.77 E:0.102154 |  forwards to Timber, there's Rice, lovely from Arsenal,
[6768.52 - 6773.52] P:1633.98 E:0.093843 |  Flickton field by Rice again, Norgard swings the left boot at the ball
[6773.52 - 6776.52] P:1515.16 E:0.106783 |  and actually misses it this time, here's Berenge, and then Timber,
[6776.52 - 6780.52] P:1698.94 E:0.099019 |  slides in, makes the challenge, Berenge goes down as if he's fouled,
[6780.52 - 6782.52] P:1649.93 E:0.086542 |  Timber walks past him, slaps him on the back side,
[6782.52 - 6785.52] P:1476.87 E:0.092581 |  says you're not getting that decision, throwing for Athletic.
[6785.52 - 6788.52] P:1669.39 E:0.099349 |  They've done really well, Arsenal, in the latter part of this second half,
[6788.52 - 6792.52] P:1643.64 E:0.103498 |  once they got that first goal, they knew that Athletic would have to open up,
[6792.52 - 6794.52] P:1504.70 E:0.105845 |  they would have to come after them and chase the game,
[6794.52 - 6797.52] P:1388.54 E:0.099179 |  if they wanted to get anything out of the game, that in turn led to the gaps,
[6797.52 - 6800.52] P:1556.27 E:0.095493 |  and that's probably what led to Miquel Arteris thinking of the substitutions,
[6800.52 - 6803.52] P:1565.61 E:0.109937 |  the pace of Martin, Ellie Trossard, Maduakiu when he was on,
[6803.52 - 6806.52] P:1549.53 E:0.097988 |  he's just come off recently, when he was on, he was Arsenal's biggest goal threat,
[6806.52 - 6811.52] P:1541.28 E:0.094710 |  but it's been a very good away performance, and a good start to the Champions League.
[6811.52 - 6815.52] P:1590.38 E:0.095815 |  Excellent start made by Arsenal, exactly what Miquel Arteris was talking about
[6815.52 - 6819.52] P:1601.67 E:0.089400 |  in the press conference last night, being on it from the start,
[6819.52 - 6823.52] P:1544.47 E:0.097733 |  100% concentration, imperative to start the league phase well,
[6823.52 - 6826.52] P:1548.28 E:0.100771 |  to not be on the back foot, and they've done precisely that.
[6826.52 - 6828.52] P:1570.58 E:0.099741 |  Defending to do here though, is Athletic Bill Bowman,
[6828.52 - 6830.52] P:1670.13 E:0.101675 |  who's been making ground into this Arsenal penalty area,
[6830.52 - 6834.52] P:1610.57 E:0.105412 |  Arsenal get there in numbers, it's Serrano, nearly wriggled his way through,
[6834.52 - 6838.52] P:1680.35 E:0.089260 |  Norgaard was able to make the challenge, Moschera clears up to Merino,
[6838.52 - 6841.52] P:1577.65 E:0.092668 |  lays it back to Rice, Rice pressure on him from Parades,
[6841.52 - 6844.52] P:1744.08 E:0.109342 |  plays back to Norgaard, Norgaard's under pressure as well,
[6844.52 - 6848.52] P:1773.10 E:0.094883 |  fouled here though by Serrano, and that is a free kick for Arsenal,
[6848.52 - 6850.52] P:1692.76 E:0.094505 |  I'm sure Arteris will be delighted as well,
[6850.52 - 6853.52] P:1580.55 E:0.104542 |  just about a few minutes here into the legs of Norgaard and him,
[6853.52 - 6855.52] P:1502.52 E:0.097123 |  and give them a feel of the plan for Arsenal.
[6855.52 - 6858.52] P:1607.34 E:0.110849 |  Get those players integrated into the side, into the squad,
[6858.52 - 6861.52] P:1651.50 E:0.095209 |  we've said so many times about the squad and the strength and depth they've got,
[6861.52 - 6865.52] P:1712.19 E:0.094151 |  and also to come back into this, we've got Odegaard, Saka, Habertz and Saliba,
[6865.52 - 6868.52] P:1565.69 E:0.092650 |  there's a lot of good players still to come back into this,
[6868.52 - 6872.52] P:1613.50 E:0.096057 |  they've come here tonight with three or four individuals that would have started,
[6872.52 - 6874.52] P:1545.21 E:0.089406 |  and like I say, the squad is looking strong,
[6874.52 - 6877.52] P:1587.31 E:0.092760 |  and this now, there's no excuses now for Arsenal,
[6877.52 - 6883.52] P:1495.89 E:0.097275 |  unless they get a load of injuries through the season, or a real dip in form,
[6883.52 - 6887.52] P:1515.95 E:0.094502 |  there's no reason now that this squad cannot compete on both runs.
[6887.52 - 6890.52] P:1737.68 E:0.101005 |  Michela Arteris will be under pressure, sorry, to deliver.
[6890.52 - 6893.52] P:1691.85 E:0.093332 |  Next challenge for the Manchester City at home on Sunday,
[6893.52 - 6896.52] P:1527.83 E:0.092479 |  it's a five-live commentary, it kicks off at half-four, Arsenal,
[6896.52 - 6899.52] P:1733.36 E:0.097414 |  playing this game out in total control, leading 2-0,
[6899.52 - 6904.52] P:1614.87 E:0.085046 |  Martinelli in the 72nd minute, Trossard making it safe in the 87th,
[6904.52 - 6906.52] P:1483.52 E:0.087891 |  two minutes have added time to be played,
[6906.52 - 6910.52] P:1625.35 E:0.089103 |  Timber from the right back position looking for the run of Martinelli,
[6910.52 - 6913.52] P:1704.11 E:0.101444 |  nearly fell to Rice, played forward by Rago,
[6913.52 - 6916.52] P:1702.03 E:0.098445 |  late charge possibly from Athletic,
[6916.52 - 6920.52] P:1689.38 E:0.089674 |  Berengea gets on the ball, 45 yards out on the left,
[6920.52 - 6922.52] P:1627.93 E:0.101159 |  Cross in, Mike Fulton and Jacqui Williams,
[6922.52 - 6926.52] P:1668.89 E:0.088967 |  it hit Gabrielle, fell to the Ghanaian international,
[6926.52 - 6929.52] P:1659.76 E:0.095373 |  but he couldn't do much with it, the ball is cleared away by Arsenal,
[6929.52 - 6931.52] P:1609.19 E:0.082378 |  looking like some tired players out there now,
[6931.52 - 6934.52] P:1704.58 E:0.090819 |  throwing four Athletic, minute and a half to play,
[6934.52 - 6939.52] P:1740.55 E:0.094644 |  job is nearly done, support still, fantastic inside this stadium,
[6939.52 - 6942.52] P:1496.18 E:0.094308 |  just as I say that, Paul Robbins has scribbled me a little note,
[6942.52 - 6945.52] P:1442.59 E:0.091315 |  by the way, have you seen no one is leaving this stadium?
[6945.52 - 6948.52] P:1461.70 E:0.103281 |  Incredible, isn't it? It's brilliant, Paul, it's absolutely phenomenal.
[6948.52 - 6952.52] P:1468.37 E:0.081460 |  Yeah, really enjoyed my time here, such hospitality we had last night,
[6952.52 - 6956.52] P:1617.06 E:0.101998 |  learning about Athletic Bill Bauer, their philosophy,
[6956.52 - 6960.52] P:1642.25 E:0.098976 |  fact they're back now, top level of European football for the first time in 11 seasons,
[6960.52 - 6963.52] P:1484.06 E:0.097357 |  next up for them, Dortmund away, next up for Arsenal,
[6963.52 - 6967.52] P:1586.85 E:0.094826 |  Olympiacos at home, minute to go in this game,
[6967.52 - 6972.52] P:1656.23 E:0.095753 |  and Arsenal lead it 2-0, and Capier makes a thumping tackle,
[6972.52 - 6975.52] P:1582.42 E:0.089726 |  but actually wins the throw for Arsenal as well.
[6975.52 - 6978.52] P:1892.29 E:0.090615 |  So throwing for Arsenal in the left back position,
[6978.52 - 6984.52] P:1619.97 E:0.086533 |  Nikola Teta pacing pensively, hands in pockets,
[6984.52 - 6987.52] P:1448.82 E:0.105307 |  way down beneath us in this San Manes Stadium,
[6987.52 - 6991.52] P:1506.69 E:0.085308 |  Arsenal's first ever visit, and they're going to come away with the win.
[6991.52 - 6996.52] P:1523.15 E:0.088962 |  Trossard makes the block, and the ball goes out for a throw in,
[6996.52 - 6999.52] P:1702.79 E:0.099808 |  to Athletic, into the last 30 seconds of the game,
[6999.52 - 7003.52] P:1547.43 E:0.087973 |  and just a few, very few, handful of the Athletic fans
[7003.52 - 7007.52] P:1480.82 E:0.081339 |  are finally going to beat the rush and head out of this stadium.
[7007.52 - 7014.52] P:1674.76 E:0.092533 |  Here's Paradez, diagonal, lofted ball to the right, nicely brought down by Niaqui Williams.
[7014.52 - 7017.52] P:1518.09 E:0.087362 |  10 seconds to play, little bit of skill from him,
[7017.52 - 7019.52] P:1613.17 E:0.100526 |  but pass forward to Serrano,
[7019.52 - 7022.52] P:1594.03 E:0.097207 |  Serrano is outnumbered by the Arsenal players wide on the right,
[7022.52 - 7025.52] P:1677.73 E:0.081953 |  it goes out for a throw in, Athletic Bill Bauer, take their throw,
[7025.52 - 7028.52] P:1598.88 E:0.096396 |  Arsenal players and fans look at the referee, wait for the whistle,
[7028.52 - 7032.52] P:1733.30 E:0.096660 |  cross into the penalty area, Timber controls it, he has time,
[7032.52 - 7035.52] P:1715.43 E:0.103748 |  he flicks it in the air, he clears the ball away,
[7035.52 - 7042.52] P:1972.51 E:0.096413 |  and Arsenal celebrate three points at the start of their Champions League campaign.
[7042.52 - 7047.52] P:1861.00 E:0.091405 |  A good win, an impressive performance, goals from the Super Subs,
[7047.52 - 7050.52] P:1697.47 E:0.092605 |  Martin Eley and Trossard have done the job,
[7050.52 - 7055.52] P:1671.54 E:0.091678 |  and Arsenal become only the third English team to win away to Athletic Bill Bauer
[7055.52 - 7061.52] P:1745.31 E:0.091093 |  in European competition, joining Manchester United in Liverpool in achieving that feat.
[7061.52 - 7065.52] P:1843.70 E:0.098316 |  Not at their very best, but ruthless when the moments came.
[7065.52 - 7066.52] P:1792.81 E:0.111667 |  Paul Robinson.
[7066.52 - 7068.52] P:1873.67 E:0.107434 |  That's not underestimate the job they've done, they played against a team
[7068.52 - 7071.52] P:1824.79 E:0.109161 |  who had the best defensive record in the league last season,
[7071.52 - 7074.52] P:1842.82 E:0.105544 |  they're a tough outfit, they're always going to be a hard team to beat here at home.
[7074.52 - 7078.52] P:1811.03 E:0.103342 |  First half wasn't pretty, but Arsenal dug in, defensively we know that they're good,
[7078.52 - 7082.52] P:1734.58 E:0.106020 |  but the changes that they've made, the signers that they've made in the final third,
[7082.52 - 7086.52] P:1634.38 E:0.104083 |  made the difference, Maddoekli was excellent, the whole time down the right-hand side,
[7086.52 - 7089.52] P:1544.56 E:0.106149 |  had a real threat, Eze down the left-hand side, never really got in the game,
[7089.52 - 7092.52] P:1793.65 E:0.093667 |  and that forced the manager, forced his hand, they made the substitution,
[7092.52 - 7095.52] P:1965.66 E:0.102005 |  and the substitutes, Martin Eley and Trossard came on,
[7095.52 - 7098.52] P:2068.24 E:0.105677 |  it was perfect time in the game, just opened up for them, the goal appeared,
[7098.52 - 7101.52] P:2048.00 E:0.115564 |  Athletic had to come out, they had to press against Arsenal,
[7101.52 - 7104.52] P:2127.29 E:0.119524 |  the holes were there, a really good start to the season for Arsenal.
[7104.52 - 7108.52] P:2199.14 E:0.113844 |  Cheers and whistles for the Lithuanian referee, and the Athletic fans,
[7108.52 - 7113.52] P:1834.97 E:0.096132 |  I think, complaining about the Zubemendi challenge in the moments leading up
[7113.52 - 7117.52] P:1567.75 E:0.092397 |  to the second Arsenal goal, but the Athletic player, I think, made too much of that,
[7117.52 - 7121.52] P:1613.15 E:0.094646 |  they are quite right to allow the goal, and Arsenal, they have done the job,
[7121.52 - 7126.52] P:1561.52 E:0.095968 |  they've done exactly what Michel Artheta wanted at the start of this league-phase campaign,
[7126.52 - 7129.52] P:1766.67 E:0.089818 |  looked like a tricky game, and they've dealt with it well, it's finished,
[7129.52 - 7132.52] P:1648.58 E:0.097684 |  Athletic Bill Balneil, Arsenal too.
[7132.52 - 7136.52] P:1483.35 E:0.095018 |  Paul, it's all right for us to have conversations about Arsenal and strength in depth,
[7136.52 - 7140.52] P:1621.46 E:0.098629 |  and we've done it ad nauseum, but that is the physical demonstration of it,
[7140.52 - 7141.52] P:1642.05 E:0.087419 |  that's what we've seen tonight.
[7141.52 - 7144.52] P:1517.70 E:0.092507 |  Yeah, and it's the pro-activist of the manager to make the substitutions,
[7144.52 - 7148.52] P:1625.07 E:0.098662 |  and to make the substitutions at the right time, to realise that signed Eze,
[7148.52 - 7151.52] P:1646.50 E:0.090182 |  we need to maybe take time to integrate them into the side,
[7151.52 - 7154.52] P:1728.04 E:0.101491 |  didn't play well tonight, Eze at all, manager realised that, made a substitution,
[7154.52 - 7158.52] P:1826.05 E:0.098864 |  got the first goal, made another substitution, the strength in depth is there,
[7158.52 - 7164.52] P:1785.39 E:0.089255 |  and when you see what's not here, if you like, Odegaard, Saka, Havertz, Saliba,
[7164.52 - 7169.52] P:1812.02 E:0.091706 |  Norgard came on, let's not forget Hesous as well, who's still there in the squad,
[7169.52 - 7173.52] P:1726.05 E:0.097399 |  the strength in depth is there, the excuses have now been taken away from Michel Artheta,
[7173.52 - 7176.52] P:1860.39 E:0.104329 |  like I said, this game could have finished 0-0, it would have been a good point,
[7176.52 - 7179.52] P:1866.42 E:0.104187 |  okay, let's build on that, but actually they've found a way,
[7179.52 - 7182.52] P:1889.15 E:0.105021 |  and they've won a game which maybe they might not have won last year,
[7182.52 - 7186.52] P:1833.70 E:0.107622 |  really good start to the season, the only bullet, the disappointed defeat against Liverpool,
[7186.52 - 7191.52] P:1865.45 E:0.109330 |  come under criticism for being too defensive, protecting weaknesses rather than being proactive,
[7191.52 - 7196.52] P:1838.71 E:0.110888 |  but we've now seen, and in Yorker as I really like him, Steve, I think he's going to be a really good signing,
[7196.52 - 7200.52] P:2018.23 E:0.108454 |  you can see the willingness of his runs, tireless effort that he puts in in the box,
[7200.52 - 7204.52] P:1815.55 E:0.113509 |  finds really good positions, and with the players around him, like Zubemendi,
[7204.52 - 7207.52] P:1796.96 E:0.106894 |  like Eze, like Maddoeki, Marino, the quality that's around him,
[7207.52 - 7211.52] P:1828.57 E:0.103296 |  he will get chances if he works in between the 18-yard box.
[7211.52 - 7213.52] P:1705.53 E:0.114267 |  We've got to have a word on Martin Ely here as well,
[7213.52 - 7218.52] P:1739.42 E:0.099589 |  I think Ali's just sort of been pushed towards the Arsenal fans there by a couple of members of the coaching staff,
[7218.52 - 7220.52] P:1797.48 E:0.088621 |  that's such an important goal for him.
[7220.52 - 7225.52] P:1968.59 E:0.109238 |  I think it is, Steve, and that's the job now for Michel Arteta, so Paul is quite rightly saying no excuses,
[7225.52 - 7231.52] P:1916.97 E:0.109310 |  but it's keeping players like Martin Ely motivated and upbeat and proving to him
[7231.52 - 7235.52] P:1790.01 E:0.107796 |  that he's going to have a massive part to play in the season, and that's precisely it,
[7235.52 - 7238.52] P:1800.05 E:0.108425 |  it happened within a minute of him getting on the field,
[7238.52 - 7242.52] P:1895.99 E:0.103118 |  and as we say, different players with different profiles, that was perfect for him,
[7242.52 - 7246.52] P:1827.73 E:0.107329 |  but if that ball had been flicked through to Eze, that's not necessarily his skill set,
[7246.52 - 7250.52] P:1863.19 E:0.098292 |  but with Athletic pushing on, it worked perfectly there, Martin Ely's sped in, took the goal well,
[7250.52 - 7253.52] P:1941.40 E:0.106255 |  and you've got two players there, I know Martin Ely and Trossard,
[7253.52 - 7256.52] P:1855.17 E:0.102662 |  you know, will be frustrated that they're not starting games,
[7256.52 - 7260.52] P:1845.98 E:0.095635 |  all you can do in that situation is come on, impact the game, that's what they've done.
[7260.52 - 7265.52] P:1763.44 E:0.115398 |  And Martin Ely, let's not forget scored that huge goal in the Bernabas last season for Arsenal,
[7265.52 - 7269.52] P:1942.69 E:0.106590 |  and Michel Arteta, so the relationship that he's got with the manager,
[7269.52 - 7273.52] P:1815.18 E:0.103097 |  and like you said, I said it in commentary, but you've got to give Martin Ely so much credit.
[7273.52 - 7276.52] P:1742.06 E:0.106635 |  He will have wanted to start this game tonight, he won't be happy sat on the bench,
[7276.52 - 7280.52] P:1737.51 E:0.109613 |  but actually he understands his role, and he knows that he's an impact player tonight,
[7280.52 - 7282.52] P:1869.47 E:0.108681 |  and he says to come off the bench and do a job,
[7282.52 - 7285.52] P:1893.29 E:0.107066 |  and actually with his first three touches of the ball, his first touch was good,
[7285.52 - 7289.52] P:1822.32 E:0.106859 |  his second touch, honestly it was a brilliant touch away from the defender,
[7289.52 - 7292.52] P:1788.65 E:0.100126 |  and then he scores, so to have that impact and that mentality,
[7292.52 - 7295.52] P:1746.32 E:0.098264 |  you've got to credit his mentality for coming off the bench and doing that.
[7295.52 - 7298.52] P:1693.07 E:0.088254 |  Great stuff you two, thank you very much indeed.
[7298.52 - 7305.52] P:1690.73 E:0.092345 |  Athletic Bill Bowneil, Arsenal 2, perfect start to the new Champions League season for Michel Arteta.
