In the England team tonight, Anthony Gordon just sprints over there and has a little embrace with Rhys James and there's a high five with Nani Madweyke as well and the players just preparing now for the start of this fifth match for England in the group. Serbia against England, the Serbian team, Dragan Stojkovic, the great Dragan Stojkovic, their coach, he's also made four changes for this match and before we get underway there's going to be a moment's silence to remember the recently deceased Dobrovoce Tanasijevic whose image is being shown on the big screen at one end of the stadium. We can't last before a moment of silence to pay the last respect to one of the most loyal ambassadors of Serbia football in the world. That is the whistle blown by one of the most experienced referees around, Clement Terpan, the Frenchman, whose referee, the Champions League final in his time. I don't think it's any coincidence that a referee of that standing has been appointed to this match and there is I think a nervousness in the home sections in the Serbian Football Association. They are very very keen that this passes off without incident here this evening and have made themselves very clear on that front and there is the three-step UEFA protocol which has been discussed by the England players in advance of this match. Serbia team Petrovic in goal, the Bournemouth goalkeeper, Eracovic, Milenkovic the captain from Nottingham Forest, Pavlovic the three central defenders, Nadelkovic as the match begins England kickoff, Declan Rice playing it back to Jordan Pickford. So Nadelkovic one of the players coming in, he's at life's sake currently on loan from Aston Villa. That's a long pass from Pickford to Kane inside the penalty area, tried to head it back towards the edge of the box and Thomas Tuchel said it at the weekend they're not going to be frightened to go direct and that's what they did Paul Robinson right from the start. Spoke about long ball, spoke about the importance of set plays that he's not afraid to go direct immediately from the kickoff all the England players lined up on the halfway line. Declan Rice played it back to Jordan Pickford who in turn launched it all the way into the Serbian penalty box and Harry Kane was battling for the header, came to nothing but early intentions are clear. So England with Mark Gay who's able just to knock the ball across to Esri Konzat and a slip there in centrefield by Elliot Anderson but England are still in possession at the back. So yes the rest of the Serbia team, Nadelkovic on the right hand side, Illic Lukic of Fulham, Maximovic and Bermanchovic across the middle section then Zivkovic and the Juventus Man Vlahovic who scored the winner in regatt against Latvia on Saturday. England attacking down the right hand side with Noni Madweke who is hauled to the ground and that is a free kick Bermanchovic. There's another one of the four players who've come in, manhandled him to the ground and it is a free kick and a very good possession for England on the right. Noticeable from England already the two wide players when England are in possession. Madweke and Anthony Gordon they both get the old-fashioned chalk on the boots. As soon as England have got the ball the wide players really stretch the pitch. Noticeably already early on England in possession they're trying to make the pitch as big as they possibly can. England playing from right to left in the first half and this free kick out there on the right wing Declan Rice to take it. Four England players gathered around the penalty spot. Anthony Gordon currently standing beyond the defensive line. Referee Turpan has just actually run across into the penalty area just to have a word with certainly Esri Konza. Anyway Declan Rice is ready with the free kick into the near post. It's a poor delivery from Declan Rice and easily cleared away by Vlahovic and England take up possession again on the halfway line. The England side tonight for Pickford in goal. He's got the ball right now in fact he's going for another long pass. Pickford looking for Madweke and it's headed out of play by Berman Cevich for a throw into England over on the right hand side. So Rhys James, Konza, Gaye and Livremento for the back four with Elliot Anderson second cap here after he performed so well on Saturday at Villapart. Morgan Rogers coming in, Declan Rice then Madweke on the right, Gordon on the left and Kane on the bench. What do you think? Well it's the same formation that we're used to with Thomas Tuchel. He's not going to stray away from the 4-2-3-1. You can understand the two holding midfielders in games like this. Maybe not so sure about it in the lesser games where you're looking for more attacking quality to break teams down. But Declan Rice and Elliot Anderson they seem to be his favourite partnership at the moment and you can see England have started quite brightly pressed high up the pitch and they are noticeably going longer. Thomas Tuchel said it was going to be a job as Madweke now takes the ball down the right hand side and cuts into the penalty area but Berman Cevich went with him and in the end the final touch was off Madweke and behind for a goal kick. Although I see Madweke there is pointing out to the assistant on the far side that he feels that he received a tug from the left wing back but it is a goal kick. There's Berman Cevich wasn't it was checking him back. Madweke did extremely well. He knew that as soon as he got into the penalty area he couldn't touch him. Slightest of touches and he went down. It wasn't a foul for me. No. So it is 0-0 very early stages five live this World Cup qualifier. Choice of listening tonight by the way the Wales Canada game is on sports extra. You can listen to the commentary on that match on sports extra but England with Rhys James on the right hand side Rhys James the Chelsea captain who started both matches this month then back to Mark Gay now who's a little bit of a doubt but has been able to train Anthony Gordon coming in for Rashford on the left hand side back to Konza now James again for Madweke down the right hand side. Madweke turns gives it back to Rhys James. Roger's points that he wanted inside the penalty area but actually England go back to Rice who is now carrying the ball out towards the right hand side and Madweke goes back to the halfway line. So 0-0 very early stages. I did mention Dragan Stojkovic the great Dragan Stojkovic a former teammate of Chris Waddles at Marseille. He's a real Serbian footballing hero as James plays the ball to the edge of the box and that is headed away out of play by Pavlovic for a throw into England's level with the edge of the penalty area but he was booed Dragan Stojkovic when he came out from the tunnel and I'm informed that that is because he has publicly supported the president of Serbia over recent unrest so the crowd have made it plain to him what they think of that nil-nil with England in possession these floodlight pylons brightly shining down here on what is a warm evening after a beautiful day here bright sunshine Harry Kane right side of the penalty area and it's stabbed back by Rodgers now from Elliott Anson out to James whose deep cross is over everyone inside the penalty area and it's clear away but actually Liv Romendo is able to take up possession Gordon all Newcastle United for England there then it comes back to the former Newcastle man Elliott Anderson 25 yards out Elliott Anderson just to his left to Declan Rice then back to Anderson England dominating the possession Rice on the edge of the box goes for goal but the shot was more or less straight at goalkeeper Petrovic who was able to drop down to his left and field it they really have started well England Thomas Tuchel spoke about the high press started on the front foot we've seen a lot more creativity and urgency in England's play it is opening five minutes than we did all weekend at Villapar it was started on the front foot yes they've gone longer the wide players have caused problems and I think with Serbia playing with the two wing backs very important for England the two wide players occupy those two wing backs and make them play with a back five. Dusan Vlahovic just miscontrolled the ball there and the reason you can hear this reaction from the crowd is that having miscontrolled it you then dived into the challenge with Rhys James and fouled him and actually that could have been nasty for James and I'm pleased to see that he's okay and hasn't suffered any ill effects. Yeah he looks okay it's a proper centre forward challenge wasn't it from Vlahovic lost possession midway through in the England half and the lunge didn't Rhys James unfortunately he's up with the back playing Rhys James looks okay. Nelnell here in Belgrade England again but the offside flag is up against Madueke. England have really looked to attack down the right hand side in these early stages but Madueke just in an offside position. Earlier Republic of Ireland lost for the first time in this World Qualifying campaign they were beaten 2-1 in the early kickoff in Armenia and a couple of latest scores Cyprus, Nel, Romania won and in that fascinating group involving Norway and Italy Norway have got an early lead against Moldova by one goal to Nel. I wonder who scored it as Rodgers tries to force his way through the middle but is challenged on both sides. A fair challenge and Serbia have got the ball inside their own half all in blue Serbia, England all in white and it was Felix Mayra who scored for Norway not you know who. Is that who you're leaning towards? That wasn't two hours suggesting Paul. Unusual if he doesn't. So Nel Nel it is Paul Robinson with a seven minutes play but a good start from England. Thomas Tuchel said in advance of this that he did expect it again for England to be a task against a 5-4-1 and that's exactly what it's been so far the Serbian back five and England having so much possession and already really promising attack which ended in that Declan Reich's shot. And that shows you the possession that England are having because this Serbia team are a back five. He likes to play the manager with a back three he pushes the wing backs on and he likes them in advanced areas but the way that Maddoekje and Anthony Gordon have started is not allowing their full backs to push on and England having a lot of joy in the wide areas so we are seeing a Serbian team we didn't expect it sat in a low block with a back five. Serbia Nel England Nel remember they played each other in the first match at the Euros in Germany last summer but the teams are much changed six changes for Serbia seven for England from that ball over the top for James to chase on to inside the penalty area but Pavlovich did well was able to take the ball away from the England right back and put it out of play for what is the first corner for. Yeah and again another good piece of play from England good passage of play not over playing not too many passes quite direct this time over the top not over playing already I mean I know it's early in the game but we see England so many times recycling possession and keeping possession for possession's sake actually in the early stages we're seeing possession with a real purpose longer possession cutting out four five six passes playing the one direct ball over the top so it is Declan Rice with the corner from the right he's already had one attempt that has set peace which was poorly delivered by his standards but this the corner and England players grouped around the penalty spot four six of them actually between the penalty spot and the edge of the six yard box Rice curls it in and that just takes a header away from Pavlovich out to the edge of the penalty area Livremento was able to take up possession for England Livremento wearing the number 16 as the left back then Elliot Anderson short pass to Anthony Gordon Elliot Anderson curls it in that was cleared away right foot volley away by Milenkovich still inside the Serbia penalty area Anthony Gordon England are all over Serbia here and then again Anderson does very well under pressure in a tight area Livremento rolls it out to Anthony Gordon Gordon lucky to cross it but that was blocked away towards the halfway line nevertheless England come again with Elliot Anderson and then Anthony Gordon and back to the halfway line extremely impressive high press from England the ball goes into the box from a Declan Rice corner and then you can see when they lose possession or Serbia try and clear the ball England they've got it ringed they've got like a circle around the Serbian defence they're not letting get out they're winning the ball but very quickly and it's been an impressive start from England Felix Mayram might have scored the first goal for Norway Paul but Erling Harlander scored the second and they lead Moldova by two goals to nil nil nil here that uh England with the ball on the halfway line and with this high tempo start that England have made here they come again Declan Rice Anthony Gordon dropping deep Gordon then playing it into Kane near the penalty area Kane back centrally to Elliot Anderson over and then have missed control from Madway Kers the ball was played out to him by Elliot Anderson took his eye off the ball and missed control that out of play for a throw in Serbia nil England nil five live listen as well via the BBC sounds app wherever you go to the live radio and if you do that and listen to sports extra you will hear what Molly Stevens well wheels lucky to have not conceded here actually John Ismail Corny has just had a shot come off the post no goals yet but what an entertaining game in the early stages really open free flowing football Wales nil Canada nil England in possession on the halfway line a whole line of flags hanging rather limply on the top of the stand on the opposite side of the ground above all of the graffiti I don't think I've ever seen so much graffiti in and on and outside a football stadium Ian Dennis did the famous walk down the tunnel yesterday here that the players embarked on tonight and they'll tell you all about that later but it's a feature here Red Star Belgrade do it as well they don't actually come and warm up on the pitch they warm up on one of the pitchers outside the stadium so the first time you see them is when they come out of the the famous tunnel England winning the ball back from Serbia on the halfway line 12 minutes played still nil nil but the tempo is good as rice goes back to gay and then across to Esri Konza Dan Burns sitting on the bench tonight with Esri Konza coming in Reese James and Konza exchange passes there and then Elliot Anderson was telling me on Saturday night how nervous he was before he made his debut you wouldn't have known it would you as Harry Kane is able to hold on to the ball and I think someone in the stands blew a whistle there not the referee and now Madwakie with the ball at his feet on the right hand side two defenders in front of it still Madwakie ball comes to a stop actually at his feet James back to Anderson then across the Liverpool mental Liverpool mental to Anthony Gordon in a central position England are being patient here and Serbia are having to oh that's given away centre field by Elliot Anderson given away to Glawage now it's being taken forward down the right hand side Glawage though runs down a blind alley in England are able to win it back and that's a let off earlier Anderson yeah that's a sloppy piece of play from Elliot Anderson England in really good possession of the ball he plays a blind ball looks a mark gay in the middle of the park gets there Glawage intercepts it thankfully for Anderson it comes to nothing but England really are in control of this game and you can tell by the crowd noise the atmosphere was excellent before the game but approaching the 15 minute mark they've quietened the crowd down already well Harry Kane who's on the ball he's been here I was here that day to see Tottenham Pochettino Maritzo Pochettino's Tottenham win four-nil here they're quietened the crowd that night I can tell you and Gordon and Livremento again this is all for England on the league on the left hand side Gordon back to Harry Kane Kane didn't score on that day by the way even though they won four-nil James right corner of the box Madwakie tries to give him it back but Pavlovich is able to come across and Serbia have got it back and actually was that an offside decision or is that even given as a free kick on the edge of the area to Serbia also when we saw Thomas Tuchel last night Ian asked him if he'd been here before as a manager and he said yes yes I have I won five-nil with PSG against Red Star Belgrade but when he unchecked it this morning we discovered actually it was four-one not five-nil but nevertheless a handsome victory and at the moment this England performance very early on in the match the only thing that is lacking is the goal to go with it I'll be really pleased Thomas Tuchel the way that his team have started I mean Serbia haven't really got the ball this is the first time now they're having a spell of possession they're recycling the ball trying to just keep hold of the ball England have started extremely well pressing high winning the ball back at a really high tempo now Delcovic though takes the ball in from the right hand side Serbia for once in possession inside the England half Ivan Ilich goes back to the excellent Milenkovic I know some of the the regular Serbia watchers feel that for all of the the praise that Mitrovic gets Milenkovic is actually currently the most important player for them the the Nottingham Forest Central Defender that's a risky pass to Mipelkovic he headed it straight into Livremento that could have gone anywhere but it's ended up back with with with Petrovic the goalkeeper who does a pickford hits a long pass over the halfway line they're all at it Paul. Well he spoke quite openly Thomas Tuchel didn't he he said he wanted a high tempo he wanted England to play with a passion with a behind possession and he said he about going long said about the long throw-ins set plays the emphasis on the set plays and we have seen that within the opening 15 minutes of this game. Fuller man Lukic sends a pass a testing pass out towards the far side. Bia Manchavic was struggling to keep it in and actually couldn't keep it in and it's out of play as he tried to to head it back into to play but that also a long pass from center field from the Fuller man Lukic, it's a throwing for England. The midfield is very congested at times when you look at the way that Serbia have set up when those wingbacks do push on into the midfield they've got a five man midfield and with Ryzen Anderson, Madiwecki Rodgers and Anthony Gordon it can be quite congested and that's when England have looked the best when they've got the ball away from that congestion in the middle of the park and got it wide. A little careless by England losing possession from the throw in and Zivkovic has taken it on and forced the corner. Declan Rice went across there to to close him down and Zivkovic played it off in an out of play for a corner for Serbia. Serbia who've got a very very good home record. Corner is taken short and swung into the back post and it I think it took a little glance which took it out into the England left back position. Ivan Ilić now centrally to Nadelkovic who hits the shot but it's deflected which carries it straight through to Pikvod all in yellow who's able to drop forward under the ball. Nadelkovic there who's given quite a lot of time and space, a well-worked set play from Serbia, first real attempt on target from distance, didn't bother Jordan Pikvod. It's like deflection in front of him, Harry Kane it was, he went out to block the shot, easy one for the England goalkeeper. That's Paul Robinson, World Cup goalkeeper for England, Phil Jagialka is with us tonight as well or he's back in the UK, we'll hear from him during the course of the evening but Serbia nil, England nil is the score with just over a quarter of an hour played. Madhwei keg, then back to the halfway line. What about the omission of Marcus Rashford and Ezra tonight Paul? He's shown that he's not afraid to make big decisions Thomas Dirk, as when you look at what he's used he's used the 29 players in the five games, rotation and personnel. Here's James swinging the ball in from the right hand side but a stretch by Pavlovic, heads it behind for another corner to England from the right flank, Romania now 2 nil up in Cyprus, so Cyprus nil, Romania 2 and the corner for England, Rhys James and Declan Rice just have a word with one another as Rice carries the ball towards the corner flag and also just makes one or two signals to his teammates in the middle. So again, Rice stands one foot in front of the other and prepares to deliver this corner which comes in now towards the penalty spot, comes off a Serbia head which clears the penalty area, Rhys James, go under pressure, tries to pass it back to Rice and actually Serbia get there first and look to break away downfield, long pass comes off the toe of Rhys James and Jordan Pickford comes out of his penalty area, England trying to play it away from the back which they do effectively, it was slightly here and scarred him and actually Declan Rice's misplaced pass puts it out for a throw to Serbia. An initial calm piece of play there from Jordan Pickford looks like Zivkovic was just about to nip in between him and Rhys James, Jordan Pickford came out of his goal, he was quite decisive, interjected into the situation, played a simple ball to Rhys James but then in turn Declan Rice loses possession, Serbia you feel just growing in confidence. Jordan Pickford incidentally called going for his seventh clean sheet in a roll, kept clean sheets in his last six England appearances which would equal his own and Gordon Banks record for clean sheets in consecutive appearances for England. I feel we're a long way off that yet. He's been excellent though Jordan Pickford, what is he winning this 77, 77, 77 cap tonight? I think he's been an outstanding performer in England in major tournaments, you know there's always been question marks on him but you look at the way he performed it ever in last season, second in this clean sheets chart, I think second or third in the club that once again struggled to stay in the Premier League, I think he's been excellent international level. So the eighth cap tonight that he's winning, second most capped England goalkeeper after Peter Shilton, long ball forward for Serbia but James is able to chest it forward and then James playing it back to Konza who's inside the penalty area. Incidentally one thing I mentioned on Saturday, I did say Dan Byrne that was the first yellow card that England had received during the campaign, in fact Bellingham also received a yellow card but just two yellows so far in the World Cup qualifying group, Pickford playing it to Greece James near the halfway line. Still no no if you've just joined us, 20 minutes played now here on this dry warm evening in Belgrade, fantastic view from here as well, darkness now but you can see the magnificent cathedral on the hill with its green copper dome, white walls and the golden cross on top of it, it is quite a sight. Here is Livremento, playing the ball back to Mark Gaye, square from him to Konza who will now step over the halfway line and roll the ball just deliver it to the feet of Rhys James, hungry of taking the lead against Portugal, Hungry won, Portugal nil, Hungry were the last team to beat Serbia here in this stadium two years ago and they've had some very notable results since then as well, Livremento against some very decent teams and when they've drawn nil nil with Spain here, Gordon taking the ball down the left, turns gives it back to Livremento, Livremento touches from him, being forced away so plays it all the way back towards the halfway line and then Gaye quickly is able to calmly play it across to Konza and England continue to build as we approach the halfway point of the first half here, Madweyke again running at two Serbian defenders, Rhys James behind him, James with the cross to the back post, Rhys with the header but couldn't get any power on it, it bounced down and an easy take for Georgie Petrovic in the six yard box so we are halfway through the first half here in the Rijko Mittic Stadium, Serbia nil, England nil, more from Paul Robinson and then it'll be Ian Dennis. Yeah they've started really well England but you can feel Serbia just about growing in confidence coming into the game, the Serbia manager Belitha, he's desperately trying to get that back five out, he's trying to get his team up the pitch but England at times are in real good comfortable possession and I've been impressed with the way that they've started. I think Thomas Tuchel-Paul will be as well because the England players have carried out his exact wish which was to try to control the crowd by keeping the ball and for that they have been very very dominant for the first quarter of this game, it is nil nil, Serbia against England a world-class qualifier, you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live, we're also on the BBC Sounds app, England are in all white, they're playing from right to left as Gordon makes a run forward and Milinkovic will just hold him off as the goalkeeper Petrovic, a Bournemouth of course after signing that five-year deal picks it up for his ninth cap in the in the Serbian goal but it's a different feel I've got to say to when you've been here in this stadium for a Champions League night I was here 2018 famous night they beat Liverpool by two goals to nil it was a frenzied atmosphere I've got to say it felt in contrast a lot more sedate not much of a not the same level of an edge with the national side although when they do get behind their side as they now come forward over on that far side they will raise their voices and can still create a real racket inside this ball-like arena that holds just under 52,000 but as John has already said 8,000 empty seats a partial closure in the end next to the England fans away towards our right hand side as now here is Rice coming forward and he just slows his run as he passes the ball in towards Harry Kane the captain who drops off into the centre circle Gordon is in a central area lays it out towards James forward now to Maddoeka on the front foot Maddoeka with a cross on the run headed up by Milinkovic Gordon is there and then the ball is hooked forwards and it goes off target and out for a goal kicks we'll get an update in that game as Swansea with Molly Stevens watching Wales Canada. Yes, it's been a lively first 20 minutes or so Ian things have settled a little bit more here now though some good chances for Wales Daniel James found space in the penalty area but the Canada keeper was so close to save it and another one where James crossed for David Brooks but he missed the volley for now is goalless. Thank you Molly commentary if that continues on sports extra you can find that through the BBC sounds app and don't forget more live football this weekend as the Premier League returns Everton Aston Villa at three the usual goal service Newcastle Wolves will be on sports extra to be followed by West Ham against Tottenham at 5.30 and then on Sunday Burnley against the leaders and the champions Liverpool of course at two and the Manchester Derby City against United at 4.30 that's how weekend offering has gone into the penalty area shoots pushed away forcefully by Petrovic he's around head height as I think Zipkovic has gone down and that'll be a free kick to Serbia it was a direct strike right at the goalkeeper Paul his first real opportunity that England have had first clear sight of goal for all the pressure for the pressing that they've done excellently well it was Anthony Gordon this time cutting in off the left hand side as you were expecting to just opened up in front of him and he got a decent strike on the ball but unfortunately for him in England it was straight at Petrovic easy one for the goalkeeper but he made it look difficult just put two palms on it pushed it 25 yards away they've gone over eight hours without conceding at home have Serbia you know they have gone two years since their last tastered defeat September 23 against Hungary France Nyl Iceland one is the latest score and Albania are leading Latvia by a goal to nil in England's group group K and Albania only two points behind Serbia and they meet here next month and that's why the Serbian FA have been quite fearful really about fan behaviour and they really have gone to great lengths to talk about making sure everybody is on their best behaviour no more transgressions that we've seen in the past talk about that partial closure because they they are fearful that the game against Albania would then be played behind closed doors and that's why they have been several messages and statements issued by all sorts of high-ranking officials and the Serbian FA to the supporters ahead of this game as England get a free kick for a push on Gordon well thankfully we've had no incidents thus far in the game but there is a pest in the crowd somewhere with a whistle we keep hearing it every time that they think that Serbia should have a free kick there's a real loud blast on a whistle from somewhere in the crowd and it has affected the players on a number of occasions also the England players were having a green laser directed at them during the warm-up ahead of the game as concert plays the ball to feet nice turn by Rogers in towards Madaweca Madaweca and it falls to Harry Kane and he can't prod it goalwards there was a lunge came in Harry Kane saying it should have been a corner kick has left footed from close range it just runs wide at the left hand post and once again that whistle was ever poor wasn't it oh first glance it's like a real glaring miss from Harry Kane Madaweca again does brilliantly well down the right hand side he puts the ball across with his right foot it's deflected into the path of Kane and I think he's just put off by the dive in Petrovic at his feet two or three yards out Harry Kane you think all day long he's going to score goalkeeper does really well he's right Harry Kane goalkeeper gets a little block on it it should have been a corner to England well he missed the chance to equal his own record of scoring in six successive games against Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday and the England captain going close here in Belgrade live on five live as we're approaching the half hour mark gay in his own penalty area Lahavic presses Pickford Anderson gives Pickford an out and then the ball out from gay he forward towards Rogers Rogers looks for the run of Gordon down the middle here is Gordon Madaweca in support Gordon will go alone and Petrovic makes the save low down to his right one handed kept alive by Livremento back towards Harry Kane England are creating openings full forward towards James back towards Harry Kane Harry Kane goes down inside the D and a direct free kick is awarded to England and a yellow card is shown as well and that was to Sasa Lukic and the fuller midfielder will now be suspended for their next World Cup qualifier against Albania that crucial game so Lukic will be suspended and England now with a free kick in the D the really poor challenge there from Lukic Harry Kane was just about to pull the trigger got a clean sight the goal England got a free kick right inside the D two yards from the edge of the box possibly too close but there's a number of players standing over it debating who's going to take it but this is on the back of yet again another good piece of build-up play from England Anthony Gordon was through one on one with Petrovic who made a really good save on a difficult angle for Gordon he choose to take this shot on quite early probably 15 16 yards out on the angle to the right of the goal Petrovic dives to his right hand side makes a big save with his right hand came to nothing in the end but once again England recycled possession got the ball back into Harry Kane and they've worked this free kick Cyprus won Romania two so Cyprus have got a goal back now this free kick is slap bang in the centre of the D must be awkward for the goalkeeper because you've got James if he wants to go with the right foot Madaweca potentially with his left and he's not going to get much of a side to this because every Serbian royal blue shirt is back in their penalty area you can't say in this situation as a goalkeeper you really are struggling to see you've got to put pick a gap through shirts through two players try and put your end man in the wall trying to give it half a night half an inch to see really difficult position for a goalkeeper England have got their own little wall of three inside the penalty area Conce is going to join on that as well in fact no he's just having a word in the ear of Harry Kane to expect Harry Kane to move away either reach James or Madaweca 0-0 5 live in Belgrade it's James fires it in might fall towards Harry Kane England are appealing for a penalty that of course we looked at by VAR comes out to the edge of the centre circle Livremento to Gordon Gordon now on this near side the left tries to go on the outside of Illich his cross is delivered deep towards the far post headed away at the far post picked up by Madaweca though for England all in white England clearly this is the the best performance in the early stages of the Thomas Tuchel reign James now with a cross on the right take city flexion and Petrovich has to dive down at his near post can't prevent it from going out for another England corner kick good spell of pressure good spell of possession from England keeping the press on high winning the ball back in the right areas looking again at the Reese James free kick very very crowded penalty area it does look like it strikes the hand of Maxim Kovic in the middle of the penalty area referee deemed it was too close there's too many bodies there in front the goalkeeper difficult one for Reese James to get a shot on target with all those men in front of him Clément Tertin the French referee who is in a garish luminous orange referee shirt and his black shorts makes his way into the penalty area play it's a VAR has clearly had a look at that penalty appeal for England and it's dismissed it corner kick to be taken on that far side the right it will be an out swinger from Declan Rice Serbia have every blue shirt back in it comes now and the goal is headed and there is Harry Kane the England captain with the header that clipped the inside of the left hand post and Harry Kane yet again England's captain with the opening goal and it's a goal that is thoroughly deserved Serbia nil England one Harry Kane 12 minutes before half time and it's been coming they've been banging on the door of England played extremely well really impressed with the way that England have approached this game and it come from a set play over on the far side it's an out swinging corner from Declan Rice there's a lot of Mellio bodies in the middle of the 18 yard box brilliant delivery from Declan Rice how Harry Kane is not picked up I have no idea 12 yards out in the middle of the goal it's got the easiest of tasks puts his head on it directs it into the bottom left hand corner in off the post wonderful start for England and a great headed goal from Harry Kane Melinkovich yesterday was saying in the press conference that we're not going to follow Harry Kane if he drops deep we'll just leave him but I can't believe that nobody has picked him up inside that penalty area completely left him didn't he I mean that's taking it to extremes I mean a player in a manner of his caliber and his goal score in Pro S isn't marked from corners we understand how you mark zones etc but you mark the centre forward you mark the danger man Harry Kane had the freedom of the penalty area but listen it's still a great header he had to stoop he got power behind the ball 12 yards out directed inside the post really good headed finish something like just over eight hours and 20 minutes of football for the first time now they've conceded at home since Desperdorf scored for Bulgaria in a two-all draw in November 2023 and they've had some notable results during that period as well the nation's league in the in the top league incidentally they held Denmark and Spain to goal a straws at home they beat Switzerland 2-0 so some good opposition have come to Serbia and have not been able to breach that Serbian back line but England have played well they're dominated and from a set piece Harry Kane with what is his 65th goal in his 81st game as England's captain took it really well as well didn't he just looking at the replays again his movement was minimal in the 18 year old box he didn't have to do a lot it's a really really good delivery from Declan Rice a pace a bend on it found the England skipper good header tucked it away inside the left hand post and no more than England deserved because they have been the better team so that's his record as a captain but it's 74 goals now in 109 as the ball is flicked forward by Rodgers and Madowakia with acceleration into the penalty area what a goal by not in Madowakia it's his first for his country and he will remember that for many a year because he latched onto the flick by Rodgers he attacked the Serbian defense with pace and a nonchalant finish and England have scored two goals in no time Serbia nil England two and the England manager up and down the touch line underneath us he's absolutely delighted and rightly so once again it's a quick change over a possession Morgan Rodgers in the middle of the park it's a death touch around the corner outside of his right boot into the path of the onrussian Madowakia who by the way has still got a lot to do he cuts it on his left foot he runs in front of the defender so he knows that he can't be touched goalkeeper Petronich comes rushing out to close the angle down and it's such a cool finish from Madowakia just lifts it over the onrussian goalkeeper and this is better from England this is what we've wanted to see a really good performance they did say didn't they yesterday that because we might see a better a true version of ourselves you know they've been criticised it's been underwhelming but they are certainly putting in an excellent performance I can see that green laser pen being directed once again at some of the England players on the pitch as it was flashing away on that left hand side but two goals in rapid fire time and England in full control he's been a real threat Madowakia ever since the game started down that right hand side and it was Morgan Rodgers he's on a number of occasions he's put Anthony Gordon in twice and it was the same type of touch from in the outside of his right boot the tiniest of touches that took the midfielder out to play Madowakia rushed on to it and it was a really really good finish Erling Harland is on the score sheet again as Norway now lead Moldova by three goals to nil first visit to Belgrade since Serbia became an independent nation in 2006 and last visit 38 years ago actually produced England's first ever win in Belgrade in six attempts Peter Beardsley, John Barnes, Brian Robson and Tony Adams were on the score sheet in a handsome 4-1 win and England leading 2-0 with seven minutes to go to half time live on five live and Serbia haven't really posed much of a danger to Jordan Pickford as Portugal have equalised Hungary won Portugal won Bernardo Silva has got that goal earlier in group half Armenia beat the Republic of Ireland by two goals to one ball clipped in by Blavich on this near side the right and it goes straight through towards Jordan Pickford once again that laser pen is just flashing at the feast of Jordan Pickford all in yellow as he bides his time you might recall in the opening game at Euro 2024 Serbia won red this season they have changed to the royal blue it's historically a significant colour for Serbia key colour in the flag it's associated with freedom faith and the sky but now I think that eye the laser pen has gone in the eye of Esri Konza and the referee has come across to have a word with the fourth official Stephanie Frappar he immediately stopped Konza Jordan Pickford rolled the ball out to midway through the England half and immediately Konza just stopped and you could see the flash on his shirt put his hand to his eyes and it's been a problem the whole first half we said about the whistle that's been there the laser pen it was a clear clear green laser pen he must have flashed right in Konza's eye he immediately stopped held his face referee as you say came over to this near touch line and reported it to the fourth official well Franco Rodoicov who's the the secretary general of the Serbian FA did say yes in the match program every inappropriate reaction insults or incident could cost us dearly he wants the supporters to be loud and dignified he wants it to be a source of strength not a risk for the national side it'll be interesting to see what happens regarding that because that was clearly been brought to the attention of the referees the ball goes long up towards Rogers who certainly played his part in that second goal with that depth little flick into the path of Maddoe Aker Harry Kane volleys the ball forward it reaches Gordon then he brings down Nedelkovich and there is no oh yes there is going to be a yellow card shown to the Newcastle player so the first England player is booked Anthony Gordon here tonight we got five minutes to go to halftime yeah they've been really impressive England haven't they I mean you can't give them enough praise for what Thomas Tupola said I like the way that they've mixed it up yes they've gone long they showed their intentions immediately from the kickoff when Jordan Pickford launched it into the Serbia penalty box direct from the kickoff and during the game they've got players wide they've stretched the pitch they've pressed high the tempo has been excellent and there's been a real mixture of keeping possession in good areas and also going long and more direct and causing problems. Melinkovic hammers the ball away downfield James though was there he was actually applauded for being so alert by Thomas Tucco Livremento has his heels clipped he tumbles over lands rather awkwardly England get a free kick just over the halfway line as they play from right to left as we look four and a half minutes to go to the break and the two and a half thousand England supporters are in good voice as I would imagine that that is the Tanoi announcement saying about the green laser pen how's your Serbian is your Serbian not up to scratch no the translation I think it is absolutely right that he was greeted with a chorus of boos from the home section so you can only presume that that's indeed what it was. Also Slobodan from BBC Serbia is still with us he says there's pyros as well that they're actually asking them not to to use those two inside the at the ground so other than that Paul my Serbian spot on it was a good guess Gordon to James James and matter of fact not quite on the same wavelength move breaks down on that far side behind it goes for a goal kick England still lead then to nil and Molly Stevens watching Wales Canada. Yeah where Canada have broken the deadlock Ian Derek Cornelius with a stunning free kick which Adam Davis just couldn't get a hand to it nestles into the top right hand corner it's Wales nil Canada one. Thank you Molly sports extra for that in fact Wales will be England's next opponents because they play a friendly in early October before travelling to Latvia as they will continue their world-class qualifying campaign as they're looking for a fifth straight win still yet to concede remember here is Zipkovic picks the ball up gets it in low referee has I think already blown his whistle for a free kick he was an offside flags up England free kick inside the penalty area. Does really well there as Rikonda initially slipped lost his foot in but might as to close the gap between him and Zipkovic England back four they've done well they've protected Jordan Pickford's goal as well as contributing to the forward play it's been a good performance all around from England. Well with Albania leading England Tuna look they'll be going seven points clear at the top of group A. Erling Harland has scored a hat trick a first half hat trick as now Norway lead mould over by four goals to nil. Pickford then with a goal kick all in yellow two and a half minutes to go to halftime BBC Radio five live this time next week the champions league is back we will have three successive nights for you of Europe's elite competition will be live in Bilbao London Bayern Munich and Newcastle United for four commentaries on five live on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday of next week. To nil went to England back it goes to to Pickford but they've had an element of control from the first whistle. They've been really impressive you can't heap enough praise on them everything we spoke about before the game that we haven't seen and what Thomas Tuchel said that he wanted from his side they've delivered you know they've gone out here tonight with the manager's words ringing in their ears the tactical approach what he said about like going slightly longer and they've done that and they've done it effectively they've played in the right areas and there's been a real good mixture the test now for this team is where do they go do they go on and score more goals do they try and see the game out from an England fans point of view the way that they've played you now want to see them press on and go and get more goals and keep doing what they're doing don't create their own problems. The Romento looks comfortable doesn't he? The Newcastle defender? Yeah I mean me and John Sawyer met the weekend Newcastle leads last weekend and I thought he was brilliant down the left hand side a lot when he played even higher advanced Newcastle had like a hybrid back four back five and the Romento was the one that was allowed to push on and obviously with Lewis Skelly not being on the plane and not making the squad it's an opportunity for the Livromento this evening. Only his second start just his third cap for Tino Livromento. Rice slows it down Anderson Harry Kane again drops off Consul will play the ball across to Gehi playing on the left hand side of that central defensive partnership with the Esri Consul one of four changes that Thomas Tuchel made inside the last 60 seconds of normal time and England through a Harry Kane header and Noddy Madowekers first goal for England are leading by two goals to nil as almost coming to a standstill is Consul just plays the ball out towards Declan Rice James is ahead of him and then that ball has been stubbed wide by by Reese James it'll go out for a a Serbia throw but the exception of possibly an Anderson mistake it has been almost error free from England. The only time that England have looked in any danger was through their own doing as you say Anderson giving away possession is dangerous area a couple of sloppy misplaced passes but other than that it has been an error free performance and Rice charging through the the midfield pressing as the ball goes back towards Geordi Petrovic the Bournemouth goalkeeper one minute of added on time that we are being played now for that additional period here in Belgrade and England will be going in at half time by two goals to nil and when they took the lead against Senegal in June and it's the only defeat in 47 games where they've scored first and lost going all the way back to 2019 and it's a route in Norway Norway five Moldova nil Martin Urdogan in injury time has got that latest goal Malinkovic of Noddingham Forest the Serbian captain coming forward carrying the ball into the England half Zivkovic is able to turn along the ground this is Lajevic can I get the shot away you can it was a dipping effort left footed off target goal kick England 2-0 yeah Morgan Rogers did well there tracks track back helps his defenders out track Blarovic all the way back five yards outside the edge of the box couldn't really get a clean shot on Jordan Pickford's goal and that's the only real attempt that they've had Serbia a really impressive first half from England and that was the last bit of action as well because that Lajevic effort there was no time to take the goal kick the halftime whistle has sounded and England are taking a significant stride towards the World Cup next summer because for what was billed as the toughest test in group K well they are making it look very very comfortable indeed because a goal from Harry Kane followed up by Maddoek has shot on the run and England will head back down that long tunnel all 240 meters of it in a very very good place indeed the Serbia supporters are not happy they are disgruntled you can hear that in the background because the halftime score in Belgrade is Serbia 0 England 2 Kelly thank you very much to Ian Dennis Paul Robinson and John Murray watching on in Belgrade also with us former England defender Phil Jagielka Phil is that closer to what England fans have been asking for yeah definitely I think the first 20 minutes to us all feeling it out but after that there's only been one team looking to score a goal and thankfully the captain came up with a header then after that we've played some decent football and fantastic flowing move for the for the second and hopefully if Serbia potentially come out a little bit to try and get back in the game we can hopefully get some more goals yeah Harry Kane on the on the score sheet again normal service resumed after not scoring against Andorra it was ages wasn't he not scored it's a drought I had plenty of that one in school very many so I had about three year droughts yeah well to be fair you weren't England's number nine that wasn't the job again yeah yeah and but Belgrade with a goal for Harry Kane and then Nonny Madwake with that that pace down the right I mean he'd been causing trouble for Serbia across the for the certainly from that that half an hour point where England really seemed to kick into gear yeah I think this camp he's the one that's probably Sean the Sean the brightest he's took his chance a bit similar to obviously getting his chance as well at Arsenal on the on the right obviously because the sack is not available and he's he's taken his the chance with both hands he's been our arguably our best player for what three halves of football so far that he's got to play in but we spoke before the game about when do you give people opportunities and and sort of experience to play for your country we look at the obviously the second goal we've got Anderson who plays it to Rodgers who flicks it around the corner to Madwake so again you know the under 21 connection there you could see even the celebrations they were all thanking each other big smiles and everyone's happy so that's when it does work you know giving opportunities to younger players to see how they deal with these atmospheres and and those three in particular have done well tonight Leon's social media says to be fair this is the best I've seen England under Tuchel but it's like saying this is the best I've seen Sheffield United under Sellers Wow he's having a great time with it to be perfectly honest I thought you might enjoy that one that was all but look I'm not because we've lost every game so well no but I thought you might enjoy the comment rather than the season so far and but Lisa says fair play to Madwake taking his chances Elliott Anderson looks exceptional much improved there was the error which only stands out because it's probably the only error that England made in that that first half but other than that what have you made of this? What I like about it though is the way he reacted you know we all make mistakes and he's making a mistake on the biggest stage he's probably played in and he's not he's not obviously going to his shell he gets the ball again gets on it helps create some chances yeah and he's doing well in that in that first half and England have looked good as they they move into the second half as you said Serbia going to have to to go for it a bit more in the in the second half opportunities will open up for for England do you think we'll start to see Thomas Tuchel make changes is he still looking at that that setup? I think he'll I'm not the honest answer I don't know I think if they're still on top and they can look like they could potentially get a couple more goals I think he'll quite like the feeling of potentially after the game selling the dream that things are coming along nicely and you know we're scoring more goals and creating more where it's obviously if you start to make substitutions sometimes it can you know slow the pace of the game down and change things around so as much as he potentially would like probably to see a few more different faces I think if the game's going the way it is especially the second half of the first half if that chance translates into the first bit the second half he'll probably stay as he is and hopefully England get on top yeah and he'll probably tell us that he doesn't listen to the critics but that doesn't mean he doesn't want to answer them Phil thank you very much we'll be talking to you a bit later on so it's Serbia nil England too at halftime worlds have got a friendly against Canada molly Stevens is watching that one hey molly hello there yeah wheels nil Canada won after a thoroughly entertaining half a football a goal that the Canadians deserved I have to say Derek Cornelius it broke the deadlock with a stunning free kick some 30 yards out they'd hit the post and the bar before that centre half got off the ball he was absolutely phenomenal six yellow cards have been handed out so far including for the Canada boss Jesse Marsh that'll tell some story to the needle and intensity this game has had despite being a friendly wheels have done well with some good chances for David Brooks and Dan James but Canada have just been relentless high pressing high energy football Craig Bellamy will need to find a way to limit that in the second half wheels nil Canada won molly thank you very much for that coming up we're going to bring you second half commentary of Serbia against England and we've got a little taster from the latest women's football weekly podcast that's after the news on Five Live with Nick Hatfield the voice of the UK this is BBC Radio Five Live thank you Kelly good evening the White House says President Trump feels very badly about the location of Israel strike against Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital Doha Qatara has mediated indirect negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza Hamas says six people were killed in the attack and Qatara has called it a blatant violation of international law the White House press secretary Caroline Levitt spoke earlier unilaterally bombing inside Qatar a sovereign nation and close ally of the United States that is working very hard in bravely taking risks with us to broker peace does not advance Israel or America's goals however eliminating Hamas who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza is a worthy goal well Israel says it conducted a precise strike and those targeted are directly responsible for the October 7th attacks Nicholas Hopton is a former UK ambassador to Qatar it raises a lot of questions not least what this means for the future of the negotiations if there is no longer a last leadership with which to negotiate it also raises large questions about what this means for the Gulf in general but particularly for Qatar who is allied closely with the United States with Britain and France Sakiastama is to hold talks with the Israeli president Isaac Herzog in Downing Street tomorrow number 10 says the prime minister will raise the situation in Gaza elsewhere six Labour MPs have put themselves forward to become the party's next deputy leader they include the former cabinet minister Lucy Powell the community's minister Alison McGovern and the education secretary Bridget Phillipson a 57 year old man's been arrested after tear gas was brought into Heathrow Airport the incident saw terminal four evacuated yesterday evening and the former master chef presenter Greg Wallace is taking legal action against the BBC over a data protection claim the case has been filed at the high court Greg Wallace was sacked in July after a report upheld more than 40 allegations about his conduct on master chef after which he said none of the serious allegations were upheld but that he was also deeply sorry for any distress caused I was the only woman who's ever been charged with gang they murder in British history this is the story of Britain's most notorious female gangster the black widow she's not a black widow spider because every bloke she's ever at ease with is either dead or in prison it's a tale of love and retribution she has delivered the fatal shot told by those who were there literally is one of those stories that can only be true because if you made it up you know you would believe it gangster the story of the black widow listen first on BBC sounds this is five live sports with Kelly Kate listen on BBC sounds it's Sabia England two at halftime in Belgrade will be back there for that World Cup qualifier the second half due to get underway in just a few minutes time in the meantime there's a couple of cricket lines to bring you England captain Ben Stokes is back in training with Durham their head coach Ryan Campbell says he's confident that Stokes will be fit to play in the ashes Sam Curran has been recalled to England's T20 side for the first match of the series against South Africa in Cardiff tomorrow it's the first time the all-rounder will feature under head coach Brenda McCullum his last appearance was in November 2024 TMS will bring you live ball by ball commentary on Sports Extra from 615 the latest women's football weekly podcast is out now on its brand new feed so let's hear Ben Haynes Ellen White and Tom Gary talking about Arsenal's 4-1 win over newly promoted London City Lionesses they brought on Caitlin Ford, Stina Blatestinius, Frieda Manum and Beth Mead and they would probably get into I would say a lot of WSL teams starting 11 so that strength in depth is something that maybe they didn't have last season so if they were able to keep everyone fit that would go a long way for them fighting for the title and a lot of major trophies but yeah you've got to give credit to Beth Mead obviously she would have been disappointed not to have started the game but showing her mentality to come on and have to assist in two minutes her impact her professionalism and obviously her quality as well because at both of those goals she could have gone herself actually and had a strike maybe would maybe could have scored but she cut she done quite a lot of chopping and then just some lovely crosses into the ball especially the kind of dinked one back poster to Frieda Manum's header but yeah credit to her with her mentality also showcasing that she is a key player for Arsenal and like you say quite in those rumors that she is going to leave because she does love Arsenal. Ellen can you just take us back a little bit you mentioned earlier Ron about the feeling in the ground so it's 38,000 at the Emirates on Saturday what was the atmosphere like and how did it compare to last season for example? Yeah I thought the atmosphere was great I think they told everyone to get in their seats because they were doing a kind of farewell to to Leah Volte and then Leah Williamson walked out with the the European trophy, Champions League trophy and that really got the place kind of rocking. Yeah it was an amazing atmosphere even when London City Lionesses went one nil up you could still feel the crowd they were still singing they were still willing the team on and then it absolutely erupted obviously when Olivia Smith scored and also I'd like to give credit as well to Arsenal that they've sold 17,000 season tickets which is a phenomenal amount of tickets to be sold for them to have every home game at the Emirates so that blueprint of what they're doing for their fan base is quite extraordinary and hopefully more teams are able to kind of look at that and think how can we grow our fan base get bums on seat get people supporting our club not just in the WSL but the whole football pyramid because that's important we need the teams to be supported. That's some going Tom isn't it to shift 17,000 season tickets. Yeah that number alone is it's 10 times the figure that we're at the game that you and I saw on Sunday between Tottenham and West Ham and you know the attendance on Saturday was 20 times that of some of the other WSL games they're kind of operating in a different like stratosphere to the other WSL clubs with the numbers that they're attracting. There's a big gulf there not just in terms of the audience but in terms of the matchday revenues that that is going to generate so if other teams aren't careful then Arsenal are just going to carry on getting further and further ahead because the more matchday revenue they get the more times they'll be able to spend a million pounds on a superstar like Olivia Smith so it's something that I think all the other clubs are going to be looking at and from all we hear at Arsenal the crowd we saw on Saturday is probably looking like it's going to be about the average for the season they're sort of expecting that pretty much give or take that every week now for the campaign and that's going to be really formidable as a just adding the footballing context as you know as a home support and what they that could do for their home record over the course of a season that that's something that will really be dangerous for the visiting sides to contend with over the course of the campaign as it starts to feel more and more like home for the women's players as well because I think if we go back maybe three years it was unfamiliar still for some of the Arsenal women's players and now it will start to have those home comforts. On Friday night Tom and I were down at Stanford Bridge to see Chelsea Man City and a good atmosphere there probably not the same numbers Tom but a good atmosphere at Stanford Bridge a really impressive and professional performance from Chelsea as they ran out two-one winners over City. Yeah it was one of those games we've seen so many of from Chelsea where I don't think they ever showed their absolute best football I don't think they ever really played more than maybe seven or eight out of ten but they've still managed to win a really important game being clinical in the key moments defending the box and then you needed to take in their chance I think they had three shots on target and scored twice which is very Chelsea in terms of the efficiency. That was just a snippet of Women's Football Weekly. Ben Haynes, Ellen White and Tom Gary were on there you can listen to it on BBC Sounds right now. Our focus this evening is on the England men's qualification campaign for the World Cup next summer they're currently two nil up against Serbia in the other group in group K which is England's group Albania are beating Latvia one nil at half time so if it stays like this England will be seven points clear of Albania eight ahead of Serbia who have a game in hand and if England do go on to win this game in Belgrade this evening they'd only need five more points from the last three matches to secure a place in the World Cup next summer and yet Phil people are still not happy. Well that's what I can't maybe want to go out there as a nation and go and dominate every game and win so hopefully there's a big second half coming and there'll be a few more smiley faces tonight and tomorrow morning. So goals so far for Harry Kane and Noni Madweke for England's second half coming up from Belgrade with Paul Robinson, Enny and Dennis and first of all John Murray. Thank you very much Kelly. Yes we're still waiting for the teams to emerge from that famous tunnel here many of the England substitutes are out Paul Robinson sitting next to me and what a half that was for England as Ian rightly said the best half that Thomas Tuchela has had as the England manager so far in his sixth match. Far none they were excellent I think they're everything that we've wanted to see from England yes they've been underwhelming in previous games but I think he's he spoke quite openly about this game been a tough test he thought that it'd be a better game for them because Serbia would actually come out and play and try and expose England but actually England have done really well to move the ball quickly and Serbia have sat in a low block at times but the link-up play that England have showed the intensity to the thing that's impressed me they've pressed really high up the pitch the understanding between Rhys James and Madweke down the right hand side most of England's threat has come down that right hand side and everything that Thomas Tuchela spoke about before this game we are seeing. Teams are out there it looks as though Draghann Stojkovic is going to make a couple of changes at halftime I'm not surprised at that they've been a long way second best in this match and and Slobodan our our colleague from the BBC Serbian service was telling us that many of the supporters were chanting Pixie out at halftime so he might be one of the great heroes of Serbian football but there seems to be a a mood against him here inside the stadium so we're going to see Philip Kostic who is left wing can play it wing back place for Yaventus and also Lukac Jović coming on the number eight who was one of the brightest young stars if you remember when he came through at Red Star Belgrade he made his debut he was the youngest player at one stage ended up getting a move to to Real Madrid who paid 60 million euros for him but his career has kind of tailed off since then and he's now actually he's just moved Lukac Jović to A.E.K. Athens so Kostic and Jović are on for Nedelkovic and Biaman Cevic so the two wing backs actually have been taken off second half begins Serbian nil England two and Serbia win an early free kick halfway inside the England half Morgan Rodgers who I thought was very good in the first half one of the four changes that Thomas Tucho made set up the Madwaker goal brilliantly but they've won themselves a set PC airport yeah surprise that Kostic and Jović didn't actually start the game they started their previous game against Latvia on Saturday in the 1-0 win and those two were surprise emissions from the from the start in 11 I think Jović will go and play up alongside Blavić trying to have more of an attacking threat and Kostic will play in the wing back position so this free kick and it will be taken by Philip Kostic the Juventus man might remember he was injured against England at the Euros and had to go off with a knee injury he curls this ball in and it's headed away for England and then played away to the halfway line and Anderson chasing it and it was a sort of 50-50 challenge he was caught by his club mate Milenkovic actually the Serbian captain is Nottingham Forrest team made has put a challenge in on Elliot Anderson as he was breaking away that's classic international football isn't it no love lost between the club mates no coming together in a real good 50-50 challenge he was there first Milenkovic the Anderson just went over the challenge but as you can see and here the support inside this stadium weren't too happy that the referee stopped the game they felt that the game should have been allowed to carry it on it wasn't a head injury no and the referee stopped play and he has restarted play with a drop ball Clementurpa so Serbia nil England two so the changes being made by Dragan Stojkovic means that the Serbia team and they've got the ball at the back just at the moment playing it long to the halfway line and now Mark Gaye is having that it Esri Konza has to stand up strongly there under the challenge and he's able to come out with the ball and give it to Elliot Anderson so Petrovic is the goalkeeper has been beaten twice the the Bournemouth man and the second of them by his former Chelsea teammate Noni Maduake as Serbia looking to improve their efforts in the second half this is better from them Illich though he's challenged by Livremento good challenge that leaves Illich on the ground and England looked at to play it out from the back although they've lost possession in the left full back position ball comes into the middle but Mark Gaye is there to stretch forward and head it Livremento takes it down he passes it forward to to Harry Kane who drives a long pass which is asking a lot of Noni Maduake he's going to do well to reach there he does reach it actually Defender goes there with him and and the two of them Pavlovic in the end is able to get to the ball out physical Maduake and wins a throw in for Serbia halfway inside his own half yes so the Serbia team Petrovic and goal Irakovic Milankovic and Pavlovic are the three central defenders Zivkovic now is the as the right wing back as England attack with Maduake Rogers ball across Rice in the D controls and shoots wide a sort of bubbling shot a bouncing shot that he pulled wide of the left post as he looked at it yeah good opportunity for Declan Rice there early in this second half again it's England's threat down this right hand side Maduake works the ball into Rogers who in turn finds Declan Rice he's got all the time in the world on the edge of the box he's getting able to get the ball out of his feet and he just drags the shot while he's disappointed so Serbia with the the goal kick as I say Zivkovic now the the right wing back Ilic Lukicjofullin and Maximovic in the central area substitute Kostic on the left and then Jovic and Vladovic Alexander Mitrovic remains on the bench and the England team if you weren't listening earlier the England team that Thomas Tukul picked tonight four changes from Saturday so Pickford in goal James Konza gay and Livremento then Elliot Anderson with Morgan Rogers and Declan Rice in the midfield and Maduake on the right Gordon on the left and Harry Kane up front who scored his 74th goal for England on his 109th appearance so Harry Kane now in fifth place on his own on the list of England appearances playing the ball out from the edge of their own penalty area Reese James going back to to goalkeeper Pickford who goes long Erling Harlanders just scored his fourth goal of the night so Norway 6-0 up on Moldova after that dramatic win for Italy last night against Israel but Norway have won all of their matches so far in that group and the final match in that section is Italy against Norway England with this score line by heading for five wins out of five at the top of group K and Maduake with the ball on the right hand side just a little past to Reese James now Elliot Anderson who's been very tidy really I know he's spoken about the mistake that he made in the first half but other than that out to the left hand side it goes with Declan Rice Rice back in field towards Elliot Anderson square from him to James who's 30 yards out Serbia all in blue 10 men behind the ball as Maduake now attacks again against Costage pulls it back to the edge of the area to James he tees up Rice with the shot that's blocked inside the penalty area by Milankovic and Serbia try to bring it away but England are all over them Paul he's done so well none he might have worked you down this right hand side again this is where the threat comes from pulls the ball back to Reese James and he lays it across the edge of the 18-yard box for Declan Rice to strike first time and we know what a good right foot Declan Rice has got that's the last two chances that he hasn't got right and now Declan Rice wins a free kick for England left of centre so another set piece for England incidentally France have equalised now against Iceland and it was Kilian Mbappe who made it 1-1 in the in that match that's being played in the park to France actually this evening Kilian Mbappe was one of the gold scorers by the way when Thomas Tuchel's PSG won 4-1 here in that match we were talking about in the first half 2-0 to England free kick taken short and then it's driven in from the left hand side Maduake with a judge came and then it's scored on the dead ball line almost and it's Henry Konza who's there to score his first goal for England virtually standing next to the post it fell to him and he swept it in and turned away and went off to celebrate his first goal for England the Aston Villa central defender and surely that's it now here tonight three goals for England and three points in Belgrade Serbia near England three the England fans away to our right are absolutely delighted they've picked up where they left off in the first half England started on the front front at a really good two or three passages of play this time it's a quick short free kick played into Anthony Gordon 25 yards from goal it's a difficult one for Petrovic to deal with it bounces just in front of the Serbian goalkeeper gets two hands on it but all he can do is push it into a crowd of England players gay as he gets there first deflects across the box you think Harry Kane's going to put it in but there's Esri Konza with his left foot just surely giving them all three points and to top off what's already been a wonderful performance so Esri Konza as it's announced on the loud speaker and you might have heard there as well I don't think you had to be an expert in Serbo Croat to work out the that was the loudest chorus of pixie out that we've that we've heard so far so in fact looking down now there is a bit of movement there I think one or two are beginning to head towards the the exits and there is a possibility that that goal might be ruled out there is a suggestion that that there could be an offside yeah the AR taking a check now much has restarted his over and the goal stands confirmed Serbian ill England three and Esri Konza scoring the the third goal Esri Konza winning his 14th cap here in Belgrade tonight Harry Kane drags the ball back that actually is dispossessed and now Lukaj Jowicz will carry the ball long and forward but incomes the challenge from James it's a foul and it's a free kick to Serbia it's got another update from Swansea and Molly Stevens Wales nil Canada won Wales have had the best chance of this second half so far powerful header from captain Ben Davis into Harry Wilson on his left who looked to score on the volley but Canada's defenders did very well to clear it it remains Wales nil Canada won Bosnia and Hurtigovina nil Austria one in group H and they are the top two in that group so Austria Ralf Ragnick's Austria winning free kick then Kostić plays it into the England penalty area it took a flick off an England head and that is being very strongly disputed it's been given as a corner by Clement Turpan but it's a corner to Serbia yeah the England players are absolutely adamant that it wasn't a corner but they're gonna have to defend as you can hear now the noise in the stadium has been completely nullified I mean it was an electric atmosphere before the game as you can see as well there's a few that are wandering towards the exits already they're certainly not happy at the moment corner to Serbia 3-0 down deep one right across the penalty area which is actually headed back by Morgan Rogers to Jordan Pickford I'm not sure whether he entirely meant that no I don't think he did I think he was a very brave header back to his goalkeeper in that situation if he did we'll give him the benefit of the doubt good piece of defended that's Paul Robinson England goalkeeper another old Stager has scored for Bosnia and Herzegovina Edin Jekyll has equalised so Austria went 1-0 up Bosnia Herzegovina have promptly equalised and earlier in this group by the way Albania were winning 1-0 against Latvia as far as I'm aware that's still the score Harry Kane in a deep line position curls the ball into the box Anthony Gordon takes it down it was Gordon's shot that actually led eventually to the Konza goal to make it 3-0 the ball as he's challenged bounces out of play and that is given as a Serbia throw 10 minutes played in the second half we will be on air by the way to hear the reaction from Thomas Tuchel and whoever else we are presented with so you will hear that on five live tonight we've got to go a long way away behind the stadium to my left I've got a actually walked down the street about 200 yards and then turn right into the training ground and they're eventually going to bring them to us in what must be the most remote interview position that I think I've ever been to have you heard what they're doing with Thomas Tuchel after you've interviewed him to bring him to the press conference I have they're going to bring him in a car from there to actually do his press conference we've got to stop it now by the way the Serbian player who challenged Anthony Gordon has has stayed down so he's going to need a little bit of treatment he did actually used to have a smart car you know when he was Chelsea manager he used to used to total into Chelsea's training ground in a smart car so he might might be back in the smart car tonight also outside the ground I saw some of the most fearsome police stroke security stroke army personnel I think I've ever seen at a football ground I mean full riot gear armor and you actually you've just picked them out in the some of them in the stands there in the empty seats the the 8100 seats that are empty that because of the reduced capacity here tonight this is a this is a lengthy stoppage actually it's it's Zivkovich just catches a stray arm from Anthony Gordon both players chasing for the ball in the corner I think there's there's no intent there from Anthony Gordon at all but what it does do it allows Thomas Tuchel to get his players over to the touch line like we see quite often the managers use these times for almost like a basketball timeout all the players are stood down beneath us Thomas Tuchel talking to them individually and taking opportunity to get some drinks on board and getting some more messages onto his team he's stood talking to Livremento quite intently yep Livremento the left back so the goal scorer as England scored twice in two minutes in that period Harry Kane and then Nonny Madweykay Harry Kane incidentally has now scored in 16 different countries for England which equals Wayne Rooney's record 16 different countries he's now got Serbia on the list and and with Declan Rice sending in the corner for Harry Kane's goal which was I mean it was as straightforward as could be I'm not sure Harry Kane will he will rarely have had as much space from a from a corner head in as he did for that goal incredible how he wasn't marked but I mean it was a really good delivery from Declan Rice but Kane still had a lot to do didn't he when the ball got to him he's 12 yards out he's kind of had to stoop and direct the header really good powerful low header and Declan Rice that's now three goals and five assists in his last 13 England appearances Zivkovich has been has received his treatment and he's able to come back onto the field Serbia are breaking forward there's a collision two players clashing off the ball on the edge of the box there's this move breaks down down the left hand side and and Harry Kane is able to turn and chip it forward for Morgan Rogers to chase after but Malinkovic gets there first goalkeeper Petrovic plays it out from the back Portugal who were one nil down are now winning two one in Budapest against Hungary and Cristiano Ronaldo has scored yet another goal wouldn't we say the other day 140 international goals I think that I think that's now 141 that he's scored Harry Kane's got a little way to go to catch up with him but Kane has has now scored five goals under Thomas Tucho and and four goals in this group so England with the ball at the back long pass from Pigford as Serbia are able to take up possession inside their own half lots of England substitutes milling around down there Paul who in these circumstances three nil and suddenly the Serbian fans come to life in the stadium looking over the top of our balcony here everyone bouncing up and down so so so someone's managed to get them going it is Lukic of Fulham who plays the ball through the middle to Vladovic that's cleared away for England actually the offside flag is up and three kick to England yeah Thomas Tucho has got his substitutes out warming up we've seen two changes already from the Serbian manager just about to make his third substitution as you say you look at the quality that England have that Thomas Tucho's disposal on the bench the likes of Eze Raster as we know started the last game Morgan Gibbs White will think he was unlucky not to start the game tonight by saying that Morgan Rogers has taken his opportunity this far maybe Oli Watkins, Jared Bowen he won't be comfortable at three nil Thomas Tucho before we see a raft of changes I think he'd want another one ideally but I do suspect just after the hour mark we may see a couple. Dragon Stokovic has taken off Ivan Illich from the midfield and he has brought on Lazare Samarjic of Atalanta for his 22nd cap the number 20 Serbian nil England 3 still waiting for that first change from Thomas Tucho who's in the in the same outfit that he was wearing at Velopark on the touchline on Saturday night at all black and he is just sending one or two signals out there as England are defending in the right back position with with Mark Gaye use holding off Vlahovic and then Elliot Anderson calmly plays it across his six-yard box Pickford plays it out to Harry Kane who goes for one of those early Harry Kane passes that Declan Rice is able to seed the ball back into the heart of the England half to Elliot Anderson just under half an hour to play Serbian nil England 3 and if you don't hear the reaction tonight then on your BBC sounds app search football daily in the morning and you'll hear us wrap everything up from here still Wales nil Canada one in the friendly in Swansea as James infield to Morgan Rodgers lovely angled ball for Kane inside the penalty area but he can't get round Milenkovic who does well actually defends it well gives it to Pavlovic still inside their own penalty area Milenkovic his clearance is charged down Rice on the edge of the box Gordon back to Rice left foot shot bounces straight at goalkeeper Petrovic who can scoop it up into his chest finding some space Declan Rice isn't he on the edge of the box finding a lot of space there Declan Rice ballwork back to him from Anthony Gordon this time it was on his left foot didn't really make any good type of contact with it harmlessly into the arms of Petrovic we're just seeing down to our left in the in the front rows of the stands there there's a disturbance there and and quite a number of men in black shirts actually are in that section and and there's also some trouble on the far side of the ground as well as a section on the far side where an area of seats has been emptied and and that also is an area where there are a lot of men in black shirts and and it it seems to have calmed down but I don't know whether there was a a point you know it's almost as if there was an agreed point where suddenly that trouble breaks out on both sides of the ground there's two or three pockets in the stadium where it's still clearly there's a lot of unrest those heavily armed police officers that you spoke about earlier they've all just made the way into the stadium you can see to the to our left they're coming all down the stairs here they come to the areas but there is certainly pockets of unrest around the stadium in certain areas it's not looking pretty no it's not and and you can hear the chanting and there must be 20 or 30 of those I think they are police they're very darkly dressed and they've got crash helmets on and visors there's a lot of families below us leaving taking the option to go yeah because that trouble did overspill and it kind of ran over like what 10 or 15 rows yeah we're sitting up high here so we're looking down on the you know it's a massive bold this stadium and as Paul Robinson says you know I can see now there are people streaming towards the exits and as you correctly spotted you know they do look like families have decided right if this is just going to be the the mood if this is going to be the 10 out the feeling this evening three nil down we're going to head off home there has been a real mood change hasn't I mean the the game at the moment it's a possession game been played in the middle of the park everyone in the stadium seems to be watching around to see what's going on but certainly the section below us is empty and very very quickly as is the far side of the stadium yeah and and actually while this is happening the match seems it seems to have affected the match and that it's now very much being played this little period here in between the penalty areas although here's Pavlovich down the left hand side the central defender with a deep deep cross which is flushed across the England goal and out of play I think it went out came back in it's given as a goal kick Jordan Pickford just has one or two things to say I think things have calmed down with the arrival of the security forces still on the far side there is an area in the stands where we can see lots of empty blue and white seats and people have have disappeared to away from that area but if you you know if you look there there are dozens and dozens of of men in black shirts probably ultras who are who are sitting over there and oh as uh England just have to be careful inside their own penalty area as Elliot Anderson is able to see the ball back to to Pickford and yes what those chants you could hear slobber down from the BBC Serbian services told us that they were anti-government chants you know feelings are running high here at the moment there were demonstrations in central Belgrade yesterday and the the president Alexander Vučić is very much the the target of that so I think that's what we're seeing here inside the stadium England breaking forward with Rogers now to Maduakie Maduakie again down the right clips it in it's headed away Rogers couldn't get there on the edge of the box actually it was the substitute Sam Argic who got there first and is able to play back to the halfway line England win it back there again Elliot Anderson strides forward with it gives it to Maduakie Maduakie left footed ball drifts it in just over the top of King that's headed away comes out to Rice Rice a shot that's blocked right across the penalty area and it actually more or less hits Pavlovic and bounces away off his body behind for an England corner he really is finding some pockets of space depth and rice we know we talk about him playing as this deep line midfielder but he's allowing with Elliot Anderson alongside him what a pivot really well and Declan Rice is making these runs finding these spaces on the edge of the box that's the fourth shot he's had now once again to no available the spaces that he's finding been really impressed with him tonight Declan Rice Declan Rice walks down here the two and a half thousand England fans are in are in splendid isolation actually they're in a section that is a long way away from from any of the the home supporters and of course they've got the the area of empty seats next to them as well the 8100 but Declan Rice applauds them and here he is now he's already set up one goal from a corner Rice with the outswinger towards the penalty spot it's bounced all the way out to Livremento who eventually gets the ball under control and gives it to his new castle teammate Gordon then back to Livremento again who goes for the dead ball line but overruns it and it is through and behind for a goal kick we are halfway through the second half then here in Belgrade Serbia Nail England three the score line Kane Madueke and Konza the goal scorers and England on the way to victory and Ian Dennis will talk you through it thank you John well I've got to say you can feel the tension inside the stadium and Jonas talks about the two areas the two different areas where there's been trouble but that section over on the far side there is now a gap that is continuing to widen and people are just walking further and further away from those who that area of the ultras who have many of them are decked out in black there's just been another tenor announcement as well but a number of Serbian supporters are leaving here and well UEFA will be watching with a great deal of scrutiny won't they yeah absolutely the second half has been marred by scenes in the crowd and there's a real strange atmosphere now there's a real lull spectators leaving by the by the dozens watching over on the far side everyone seems to be streaming out of the stadium and there's certainly big patches of empty seats and as you can hear the effects might that we've had up for the for the noise and the incredible atmosphere in the stadium it's completely turned and changed full circle it's almost silent in here England have made two changes Rashford has come on for Gordon and Jed Spence has come on for England he is the 30th different player that Thomas Tuchel who's used in now his sixth game in charge but Jed Spence becomes the first muslim player to represent the men's senior side a proud night for Jed Spence and I'm sure he'll be hoping to inspire others in years to come so he comes on for Rhys James so Jed Spence has been playing actually as a left back for for Spurs goes in at right back instead of Rhys James as there's going to be another change here for Serbia and Alexander Mitrovic to receive that presentation ahead of the game the former fuller the Newcastle striker now playing his trade in Qatar comes on for his 102nd appearance and it is like the like he will replace Toussaint Blajevic so Alexander Mitrovic comes on but it is a string ill to England indeed I was just saying to slobber down as well you know that that England win 4-1 in Belgrade is still the heaviest home defeat that Serbia well that was actually against the old not was the old Yugoslavia wasn't it but so for Serbia this actually matches the defeat to Belgium in October 2012 which is actually their only defeat in their last 28 World Cup qualifiers at home going all the way back to 2001 but England have been absolutely outstanding for Thomas Tuchel and Madoeco once again driving as Pavlovic back pedals goes through towards Rodgers try to turn stopped Lukic will bring the ball away for Serbia all in royal blue playing from right to left against England in white as Spence goes to ground makes a challenge well timed out it goes for a throw and about 19 minutes remaining here on BBC Radio 5 live he's kicking every ball tonight Thomas Tuchel there's no chance of him sitting on a drink school watching this game he's living every moment he's team 3 and 11 giving him the performance that is asked for and even there Madoeco he had a good option give the ball away and you could see the frustration on Thomas Tuchel he wants him to go and score more still the riot police remain in the area beneath us just slightly away towards our left hand side up towards Mitrovic easily knocked off the ball by Gehir Rashford plays it forward towards Harry Kane Harry Kane goes into a challenge with Milinkovic and the two captains coming together and Milinkovic is off the Nottingham Forest Defender has been sent off by Clemence Terpac Milinkovic is protesting he was the last line of defense and it is a straight red he must have still been about I don't know 30 yards out from goal but because he was making a direct run Harry Kane he wasn't running out towards the left hand side because he was caught Clemence Terpac has shown him a red card yeah it was the last man Harry Kane was about to get around clumsy tackle by Milinkovic not really no much malice in it but I think you could see that Harry Kane was going to get round the other side of him I think that's what's gone into the referee's mind Kane would have had a free run on goal the Serbian players Mitrovic included still surrounding the referee but the referee to his credit he had no hesitation he was right there he was right on the spot immediately ran over and showed the red card yeah we're watching the challenge again Harry Kane still down receiving treatment it's a clumsy challenge more than anything isn't it and the referee's deemed that to have prevented a goal scoring opportunity it has been checked on VAR and he's wandering off Willie Dela Jod is the VAR official from from France and he's just indicated to Clemence Terpac that the decision was a correct one and now he's got that long long walk so the captain of Serbia in any hopes of the English media hoping to speak to the forest defender for that managerial change at the city ground in that mix zone might have also just taken a bit of a turn as well because I can't really see that the Serbia captain will be forthcoming tonight uh Pavlovic incidentally was booked as well for his protest Moldova have got a goal back Norway seven Moldova one France two Iceland one and Bosnia one Austria two our latest scores so for the next 16 minutes they're going to have to see out this game with 10 men on what is a knight that is proven to be rather costly in more ways than one bearing in mind that Sasalukic picks up a yellow card in the first half he will now be suspended Malinkovic will be suspended and I'm sure as well that you wait for will take action for the trouble in the stands bearing in mind that those warnings from the Serbian FA have not been heeded as rice for the free kick kills it in Gehe is there and England have got a fourth goal Marge he guides it in inside the six yard area it is a comprehensive victory for England as they take a significant step towards the world cup next summer toughest test in the group Thomas Tuchel side have passed it with flying colors they lead four nil statement made Benchmark set great performance from England again it's such a simple free kick he spoke about set plays and the importance of them Declan rise with an in swinging free kick Serbia all over the shop just gone down to 10 men marking nowhere to be seen Mark gay he's got the freedom of the six yard box it's lovely ball by Declan rise over the top of everybody gay with the outside of his right boot beats Petrovic from close range four nil what an excellent performance his first goal as well so we've had first goals for England tonight from money man awake at Esri concert and mark gay he on his 25th appearance but what has been certainly a difficult time at his club with that move to Liverpool falling through on deadline day his attitude Thomas Tuchel has said has been absolutely spot on and he has got that fourth goal as Norway have rattled in an eighth now against Moldova and too many has been sent off for France as they lead Iceland by two goals to one Belkovic is coming on a defender for Serbia so he I think it was if Kovic has gone off Belkovic has come on and England have also made a couple of changes as I think the Serbia supporter is trying to get at the England section that's not very wise at all he's trying to pull down some of the St George's flags that are draped over the the red railings away towards our right and in fact security now are making sure that the reinforcements I mean how can he come through that gap he's got to climb over a white wall red railings and then get onto the track but he's now been taken down to the ground England have made changes Maddoiga and Kane are off and Watkins and Bowen are on it's all happening in fact the riot police now are having to go and deal with that supporter who's been apprehended and is still faced down on the red tarmac I tell you what Ian I'm glad you're here tonight because I don't fancy this walk back to the hotel I'm glad I've got you by my side you on one side and John on the other we'll be all right won't we I'm glad I've got you in the middle in a rapidly emptying Raiko Mitic Stadium here the home of Red Star since 1963 and I'm sure the Serbian FA will not at all be impressed with the conducts of some of their supporters as that it'll flick downfield by Bowen spent with the at the cross from the right hand side there's a slip there it'll be picked up now by Bowen once again in a central area out towards Rashford links up well crosses the ball in towards the penalty area and then it's swept away by Kostic and it'll be a free kick to Serbia I'm thinking I'm watching more what's happening off the pitch rather than on it yeah it's been a debacle hasn't it really has the behaviour and the conducts of the home supporters we know there's unrest in the country at the moment but the the riot police they're having to do the job now they're reprimanding that supporter who tried to make his way over to the England supporters the stadium as you say now you can look around to our left and you can almost pick out the right in on the seats there has been violence there's been it would be fighting really they've been fighting amongst themselves haven't they yeah they have and I'm sure that UEFA will take note as well bearing in mind I mean this is staggering over the past five years the Serbian FA have been fined as I'll just hold off because Rashford in towards the penalty area Rashford shoots good shot as well and Petrovic with a very good save he opened up his body hit it right footed from just inside the area central position Petrovic away to his left made a tumbling save yeah it's a smart save from Petrovic this game's over England are picking and choosing as and when they want to attack good play that time from Marcus Rashford he's come on playing wide on the left and he that trademark move that we see him do so often cuts in alongside the edge of the 18-yard box on his right foot decent height for the goalkeeper Petrovic but a good save turns it around the corner England corner Bowen's going to take the the corner kick we've got about 11 minutes remaining here in Belgrade missile then it's just been lobbed from the supporters in front of us didn't reach Jared Bowen it'll be picked up by an official corner's taken short Bowen then towards Rice back out towards Rashford Rashford then with a cross only partially cleared Anderson down into the ground controls it runs slows it down back out towards Rashford and here is Rice once again England lead by four goals to nil Rashford Anderson Bowen on the inside Rogers gets a touch passing the ball quickly sharp Chris passing Bowen now comes inside in towards the penalty area might run through out towards that far side gay he with a cutback saved by Petrovic his legs Declan Rice hit it first time left footed and Petrovic's not made the saves he had England could have got seven or eight here tonight yeah that's another good save by Petrovic and Bournemouth goalkeeper England fans away to our right they're starting to enjoy the hook they're away trip now really really comfortable it is now for England picking Serbia open at will the wide areas Rashford Declan Rice once again getting in a really good position just watching the replay excellent save and as you say it could have been six or seven for England there are six riot policemen stood in front of the England supporters I would suggest that they need to stand in front of the Serbian supporters I'll tell you what I'll carry on you go and tell it mate Jordan Henderson is going to be killing on his 85th cap he was heavily involved in the in the warm-up with the starting 11 almost like what you'd see as a as a coaching member of staff like a player coaching role but Jordan Henderson comes on Declan Rice who's had an outstanding game in the midfield makes way so Jordan Henderson comes on for the next nine minutes or so of normal time where England lead by four goals to nil and I would say now the stadium here in Belgrade is probably about half full judging by how many Serbian supporters have left already a lot of stewards with their luminous yellow jackets and out stood in front of the Serbian supporters on the far side where the corner comes in okay he couldn't get there if a mental turns then the ball from spent back out towards that far side space we're going to run into drives into the penalty area fast and across the goal and then it was steered in by Rashford at the far post but the flag was up and it was offside and that goal will not count defensively the Rashambo Serbia led down tools they just want the final whistle and really good play again by England this time Jarobo popping up on the left hand side he's got what 10 15 yards of space to run into freely into the box hammers a shot at the far post it's a cross come shot Marcus Rashford looked to try and tap it in at the far post but he strayed just offside again another good passenger play for England I didn't want to miss any of the action but I was going to tell you about this staggering statistic about the Serbian FA so over the last five years they have been fined 703,375 euros which is 30,000 euros less than the fines in the previous 14 years how would suggest there is going to be more incoming from from UEFA Norway 10 Moldova 1 Harland has now got five of those 10 goals well his week has improved did you see him in social media this week I didn't manage to pick up three stitches on his chin this week Erling Harland for a collision with the the the bus door the bus door yet inadvertently opened up on his chin so if you see Erling Harland playing tonight with a slight graze on his chin and three stitches he had a fight with a bus this week we've got seven minutes remaining and Jordan Pickford on course for that seventh successive clean sheet which actually would be his 40th clean sheet in his England career that would mean that only Joe Hart and Peter Shilton have kept more clean sheets because that would take him level with David Seaman impressive that isn't it it is he's nearly had as many clean sheets as I had caps I'm gonna say mind you your ratio was good Paul it was it was decent ratio 24 clean sheets in 41 yeah maybe slightly prematurely ended my own international career here is spent for England all in white the England supporters singing the national anthem every outfield player is in the half away towards our right hand side England their hunger levels haven't diminished they're still looking for more goals here is Rogers that was a nice little turn just scoops it out towards bowing bowing now with a shot takes an efflection might fall towards Rogers and then it's cleared by Kostich but Serbia really are coming under all sorts of pressure they've been superb tonight England they really have we spoke in the pregame show about Thomas Tuchel about what have we seen what we learned from him since he's taken over this is everything that we wanted to see I mean like you say the international managers don't get that much time with the teams they don't get that much time with these players to work on the training ground nor that many games in succession this is the first game in Thomas Tuchel's reign where we've actually gone yeah we can see what he wants to do here I like this they're playing a mix of longer balls playing in the right areas they're pressed high they've been really impressive Rashford again jinking his way towards the penalty area still going ball stuck to his feet place it out the area shot then comes in from Anderson went to try and place it with a curling effort blocked Liberamento over on that far side England lead by four goals to nil just have a five minutes to go to halftime live on five live as the ball is cleared but just Serbia can't get out they are being forced back and this is spent this has been so impressive from an England point of view and they're going to equal a record as well because it would be seven competitive games where they have not conceded which would actually equal a record set by the Subabi Robson side in the late 80s October 88 to October 89 four nil they leave under five minutes to go we're on and through till 10 30 will bring you as much live reaction as we can if not it'll be in the five live football daily part Tony Libsson remember takes over at 10 30 on five live England supporters two and a half thousand of them stealing good voice away towards our right here is spent out towards Rogers Rogers back inside to Henderson they have always a slip there by Anderson in the midfield but then given away by Mitrovic going stopped Mitrovic picks it up deep inside his own half for for Serbia quickly crowded though by England who are still hunting impacts for the ball still chasing the ball down even in this late stage what would you say has caught your eye the most I think Maddoek he's been outstanding on the right hand side until he Gordon's played well and I think the way that the the wide players stretch the pitch made the game open and allowed England to play but I think the biggest change you can see tonight the directness that instead of the five six seven passes to try and create something they'll go over the top or play slightly more direct and then play in the right areas it's been a possession with intent it's been a real performance from England tonight they've set out to win a game and they've carried out exactly what the manager said they were going to do I've been really really impressed with them and it's a long time since I've said that about England yes yeah it's the the first glimpse as you say we certainly didn't see anything from Thomas Tuchel in his first five games in charge but to be fair to him he's been maintaining all along that progress was being made certainly the the field from the England camp at St George's Park that it's been a good week in the in the training when they arrived albeit delayed last night few two I think storms delayed that takeoff from Birmingham airport they arrived in really really good heart and speaking to Harry K and they were optimistic there's now they're racing away and it's Rashford on that far side the left who's been sent clear and Rashford now carries the ball to the edge of the area with pace enters the box slips it into the path of Watkins who goes down referee has a good look at that wats his finger and says no penalty York to Tam with Nill as the latest score in the National League this is five line oh that was a penalty that looked all the world for a penalty only Watkins still down in the box on the way to our right hand side Marcus Rashford does extremely well half a lend to the pitch gets into the box sees Watkins on his outside Thomas Tuchel stood by nose on the edge of his dugout arms are wide I'm still asking the referee forn him up is not happy I mean that's a really clumsy challenge on Ollie Watkins Orakovic I think it is and it's a stone wall penalty for me I'm sure that VAR will check it how he's not given it is seeing it the referee's been excellent this evening England players around the referee they want a penalty seeing one replay and it looked all the world a penalty well Harry Kane is off the field of course he scored his last 31 penalties for club and country this has got to be a penalty Jordan Henderson now is in the in the ear of Clemence Epper but having a look at it again it has to be a penalty surely he's coming over he's coming over to this game I mean we've only been privy to one replay but I mean we are sat quite a distance away from the pitch and the incident but I mean you could see quite clearly from up here I mean you could see Ollie Watkins reaction I mean at four nil up he's not going to dive in that situation he's gone over and it's a really clumsy challenge and it's it's it will be given as a penalty well Serbia's record defeat overall was a way to Ukraine in 2019 when they lost 5 nil the penalty has been awarded and England now have got an opportunity to get that fifth goal Erykovich with a challenge on Rashford and it's been a sorry night for Serbia this really could put the icing on the cake for England everything that we spoke about before what we wanted to see from England this is what we've been waiting for this type of performance in what was potentially a really difficult place and you and John have spoke about the stats and how long it is since Serbia have lost the game here and the intimidating atmosphere this on paper was a really difficult place for England to come tonight and they've certainly put in one of the best performances in a long time. Marcus Rashford has been given the ball he places it down on the spot England all in white are playing from left to right as we look he's up against Jordy Petrovic who stands on his goal line Marcus Rashford waits he's almost side on before he starts his run up he's giving no clues as to which way this is going now he takes a couple of steps back a stuttering run up from Rashford and Rashford scores slots it in with ease Marcus Rashford with his first goal in almost two years for England seals what has been a five star display sorry night for Serbia Serbia nil England five job well and truly done mission accomplished here in Serbia tonight excellent performance Marcus Rashford the trademark no luck penalty like we've seen Ivan Tony do over the years waits for the goalkeeper sideways run up stutters almost kicks it off one step watches the goalkeeper and as soon as the goalkeeper drops his shoulder Marcus Rashford places it into the other side all round excellent evening for Thomas Tuchel and England if you were to say a five star display then for England what could you say for Norway as they've just got another goal heaven 11 Norway 11 Moldova one and the Rangers Taylor Asgard has got a hat trick for for Norway so five for Erling Harland and three for Asgard three minutes have added on time here in Belgrade England leads Serbia five nil so it is a joint record heaviest defeat for Serbia as we will go Wales Canada and Molly Stevens yeah Wales nil at Canada one we're into three minutes of added time here Ian Mark Harris very nearly got the equaliser for Wales in the past few minutes but I have to say Canada have played some brilliant football tonight really exciting to see what the World Cup cohorts can do next year at the World Cup Wales nil Canada one thank you Molly England incidentally have scored now in each of their last 22 World Cup qualifiers 67 goals in that process going all the way back to 2016 and a goal a straw away to Slovenia I don't think there'll be anybody left in the Serbia area of this stadium you know very very rapidly emptied started slowly in the second half people trickling away when the violence started but now it's almost empty isn't it apart from England fans away to our right who will no doubt be kept in but they will certainly enjoyed what they watched this evening yes they will some of the horns are being sounded as well as we've got 60 seconds remaining and we'll try and bring you as much live reaction as we can before five live sport finishes at 10 30 but the there is indeed the final whistle so impressive oh no that was the whistle from that's the whistle in the crowd that for me on that occasion did you the players stopped as well I know it wasn't just you the players had stopped even the England supporters cheered too I thought he was blowing early the England support staff have all got up off the bench and started to pack up as well I'm glad it wasn't just me here is here is Spence he hasn't watched the referee he's about to blow it you keep your eye on the referee I'll listen out we've got about 15 seconds remaining the old ladies from the England supporters five nil Henderson spreads the ball out towards Spence Spence brings it down off his right knee Rogers in field and there indeed is the final whistle this time and an impressive performance from England in every aspect but for Serbia a night to forget Serbia nil England five Paul you've run out of superlatives for England tonight it's everything that you wanted to see I mean the performances in recent games have been lapped luster there's been a poor watch remember sat home watching the game at Villa Park at the weekend thinking you know it's a it's a poorish performance but tonight everything that Thomas Tuchel said what he wanted from his team the tactics that he set his team up they followed it out right to the nth degree it's been a really really workman like impressive statement performance from England tonight but like I say it's what you want to see it's what you expect from England we've got the quality of players but we've not been able to get that type of tune out of them before Thomas Tuchel in the games leading up to this we haven't seen that type of performance but he certainly got a performance out of them tonight that was impressive certainly was Canaan Madiwakar in the first half Kansa Gehi and a Rashford penalty in the second half giving England that five nil victory as you can hear the England supporters away to Walter right hand side but those that have remained in the Raikou Mithic Stadium booing once again the Serbian coach Dragon Stojkovic coming under increasing pressure from the supporters they finished the game of course with 10 men after descending off of Milenkovich with 18 minutes to go the England players go back knowledge the traveling support on a great night for England Serbian nil England five Kelly Ian Dennis Paul Robinson and John Murray in Belgrade for us we're also joined by Phil Jagelko we'll be getting their thoughts right the way through until 10 30 here on five live sport on social media garras said very impressive by England this has been achieved without Palmer Bellingham Foden Stone Saka Alexander Arnold all world-class footballers Stephen says Morgan Rodgers has been excellent his press was put a lot of pressure on Serbia John asks where did this come from after two died games and or ever get this sublime show and Sam said I can't wait for the it's only Serbia comments I don't think you're going to get them here we're going to be talking about a really good performance for England a five nil victory for them in Serbia between now and 10 30 if you think that was good Norway have beaten Moldova by 11 goals to one five of those Norway goals for Harland ahead of this weekend's Manchester Derby there is commentary of that on Premier League Sunday Hungary two Portugal three finished Armenia two Republic of Ireland one earlier and France two Iceland one Wales in friendly action against Canada and it's full time in Swansea Molly Stevens yeah Wales nil Canada one Kelly Canada take the one nil win Jesse Marsh's side a really exciting team to watch one touch two touch front foot football their goal came in the first half thunderous free kick from centre Derek Cone center back Derek Cornelius lots of learnings for lots of young Wales players tonight who just didn't find a rhythm in the game Wales lose for only the second time under Craig Bellamy and guess what next up for them it's a friendly against England at Wembley as Bellamy continues to test his side amongst those world cup qualifiers it finishes here Wales nil Canada one that's one to look forward to Molly thank you very much for everything this evening so Ian Dennis Paul Robinson and and John Murray are in Belgrade for us Phil Jagellka also joins us to reflect on England's five nil defeat of Serbia in Belgrade and Philip BBC senior football correspondent Sanny Mock Bell has said on the the live page on the website finally the Thomas Tuchel era has lift off is that fair comment yeah I think so it was always going to be a tough game to go to Serbia and get the win let alone winning the style that we have we scored some good goals we scored some good set of pieces every box pretty much ticked and we said before obviously we're missing some key players but sometimes that gives opportunities to players they potentially wouldn't have got a chance and I think those lads have done really well tonight Paul England managers when they come in all managers really but England managers in particular they need a statement win a statement performance has Thomas Tuchel got that now said it before the game that's what we needed and absolutely I mean that's the best that I've seen an England team play for a long time I mean we saw in the the previous games against Andorra Latvia Albania they won the games but they didn't win them convincingly that's the type of performance that we should have seen against the lesser sides if you like I mean England if it wasn't for Petrovic tonight in golfer Serbia England could have had six seven eight goals they were that good tonight you know Serbia folded at the end when Malenkovic got sent off but England reduced them to that England battered them into the corner they just didn't take their foot off the pedal tonight they pressed high they won the ball back they used the ball wisely in areas they used the set plays Madiwek and Gordon were outstanding in the wide areas and it was just a really impressive all-round performance and in answer to your original question absolutely that was a statement win and Paul those two goals coming round about the half hour mark for Harry Kane and Nonny Madwaking meant that Serbia had to come out we said this at a halftime that England were going to find that there were more opportunities in the second half but just talk to me about the performance up to that point for that first half hour you talked about England sort of grinding Serbia down yeah they were constant they just didn't go away and when they did lose possession they wanted to win it back and it wasn't just isolated incidents of individuals pressing they pressed as a team they pressed as a unit we all talk about you know in the media and in the press teams got to have an identity you know what's what's an identity what does it look like that tonight is an identity they pressed as a team they pressed as a unit they won the ball back but when they won the ball back the two wide players got wide they made the pitch big the relationship between Deckham Rice and Anderson was impressive the whole spine through the team Konza and Gage you know kept the Serbian strikers very very quiet all over the pitch every single individual won their battles yes we'll say you know that's what should be happening but it hasn't previously happened like I said to you I watched the game at Villa Park at the weekend and like many others I was thoroughly underwhelmed by it tonight I was excited to watch that that was a good England performance to be fair I couldn't agree more Paul like they've gone into a little bit of an intimidating atmosphere and they've done something that's quite nice for the England team is to to recognise the Serbia team was under a little bit of pressure they've not scored many goals you could see their fans could potentially turn and for once rather than a team coming in shorts or trying to quiet down the English players and team we went there quieting them down and we a thoroughly professional performance together we're quite a young squad as well quite a lot of young lads as I said before they played together the 21s took their chance tonight that was actually the remit as well Phil Thomas Tuchel when he was addressing the players they wanted the message was to keep the ball let's try and control the crowd early on they were so proactive from the first whistle carried out his his message to a to a to a tee and also as well Kelly that in those in his six games that was for what was the toughest test for England the most inexperienced team that he's named the starting 11 only had 340 caps so that's the least experience side he's picked in his six games and as Paul has already alluded to so many impressive performances in that 11 by far the best performance without a shadow of a doubt and that happens quite often you know when you look at the the players that are not in the squad I mean we spoke about it before the game Grealish Foden Trent Alexander-Arnold Saka Wharton Bellingham you know those players were likely to come back into the squad at some point but quite often when you have big names missing the team then becomes the star and the team tonight for England they were united they were there was a lot of cohesion there was a lot of understanding and you could see relationships forming on the pitch the right hand side was the most dangerous for England with Rhys James and Maddoekie really impressed with the way that Maddoekie played tonight a lot of positives he's hit 30 players used already Thomas Tuchel as he tries to kind of to come across that that first choice starting 11 that we talked about in the build-up to the game and it's worth mentioning as well Phil the players we touched on this earlier on Palmer Bellingham Foden Stones Saka Alexander-Arnold not in the not available for for this game yeah we know how good this jump in depth is but you sort of don't really want it at the same extent and it's a great headache now for Thomas Tuchel but those players that have played especially tonight have put their name down to put a marker down now and it's going to be tough for those players no matter how well they play to come and ask to be starting in the next game so it's a great headache to have as Paul said the relationships that were that look like they'd they'd formed even over tonight but you know working especially on the right side even obviously Morgan Morgan and then number 10 and things like that you know these are going to be tough people to move and you know if I was in the England squad tonight and I saw that game I know I've got a lot of hard work to try and get back in there the other game that took place tonight in England's group Albania beat Latvia by a goal to nil so the table looks like this England are top having played five games with 15 points maximum number of points as we know from from their games with a goal difference of 13 Albania are second with eight points Serbia eight points behind England now although Serbia have played a game less Latvia on five games with four points and or at the bottom with with no points from their opening games England now only need five games I think five points from the the remaining games I think Deno I will take your mathematics with that lady Kelly I think they need five points from that they're remaining three games in in this group which puts them Paul in a really really comfortable position and look they've they've had as you said steady performances or steady results really with with low key performances tonight has kind of changed all of that and it's shown what what this group of players are capable of was there something in the way that that England set up I know you talked about the new players coming in the fact that they're they're not necessarily experienced players but was there more attacking talent was it a more attacking attempt what was the difference in this performance it was the intent it was the tempo immediately that the game was played at and when they they took the kickoff Declan Rice went straight back to Jordan Pickford but when England had the kickoff every single player in a white shirt was on the halfway line it was a set play it went back from Declan Rice to Jordan Pickford who then launched it into the Serbia penalty area and they want to throw in deep in in Serbia half I mean nothing came of it but they weren't afraid to play these longer balls into certain areas and then allow their talent to play football in the right areas they didn't put the ball at risk at the back we quite often see teams over playing rolling the goal kicks across the six yard line we didn't see so much of that yes there was incidents in the game where they played around at the back and they they controlled the game is the best way of describing it there's there's a time and a place to keep the ball and rotate possession in and around your own 18 yard box without putting the ball at risk and England did that and the possession the tempo and the control over anything was the most impressive thing that England had tonight because from the first whistle to the last they were in complete control and you could see exactly what they were trying to employ the whole game it was it was good it really was Kelly and just some extra context to that Serbia have lost just one of their last 28 home world cup qualifiers since 2001 and that was defeat by Belgium in 2012 this is not an easy place for any team to go and and get the result and England have done it in style with that that five-nil victory Phil you said that if you were maybe one of the more senior more experienced England players who wasn't involved this evening you'd be knowing that you'd have to work hard to get your place back in the squad who do you think's done a done a good job for England who's going to put themselves right in there in the manager's thinking well I think we alluded to it before obviously Maddoek is obviously shown out Morgan Rogers in the 10 again and we spoke about who's going to play sort of the holding holding midfielder you know again Anderson came in did another good job it's difficult obviously he'll chop and change again but it's a it's a really nice thing to know that basically whoever normally gets that position that role now is going to have to step his game up and that's what it should be it should be the hardest squad to get into because we've got so many good players and that's the way it should be but I'm sure we'll be having all sorts of different types of conversations when the squad's announced next time and there's probably people not in it or different people starting different places but that's where we're at but hopefully Thomas Tushal's found out a few things about his his squad and his players you know they can play in tough atmospheres tough places to go as you just said they don't lose games at home so they'll be a lot alone get battered five-nil so a massive massive box ticked as far as character and and stuff goes tonight and he'll be looking to take that forward obviously to the fed-up on him for the World Cup I tell you what's interesting Kelly is that is that Thomas Tuchal just particularly if we focus on the right back you know Alexander Arnold and Kyle Walker have been admitted from the squad and Thomas Tuchal sees that Rhys James and Tino Livremento are ahead of Alexander Arnold and Walker for that right back slot at the minute but the versatility of Tino Livremento is that tonight he played as a left back you know Rhys James earlier on the campaign played as a left back so the two who he sees vying to keep out Walker and Alexander Arnold in the right back slot have both played as a left back in this campaign and he's got a lot of options in defense as Thomas Tuchal in that respect I think the options he's got I mean we all talk about his as he does he know his best 11 he will never pick the same 11 as an international manager because you'll have players are out of form players who are injured and like we said the players that are missing from this squad but the players that aren't in the squad or the players that didn't play tonight will watch that performance and they will know that that's what is expected of them now that's the way they've got to play and that's what the manager wants his best 11 is listen you'll never be able to do that as an international manager because of the the rotation of players but he certainly if those players are fit and available next time it'll be interesting to see what he does it's happened three times that England have named an unchanged side three times since 1982 right so that puts that one into context and just on the on the liveamento point and on that that idea that his maybe his right backs can can also play as left backs do you think that's deliberate from from Tuchal and that he wants to bring versatile players into the into the squad because over the course of a tournament as as everybody's kind of alluded to there are going to be injuries there are going to be players in and out of form there are going to be situations where you'll your need players to do something other than what their their first choice position is yeah I think so definitely I mean it'll be it'll be a squad of 26 but in in that as well you're going to have you could well Lewis Skelly as well he was not included in the matchday squad of 23 today but he's he's been a I thought was going to be a regular at left back you've got you know the potential for Hall at Newcastle possibly as well so that he's he's got these options on the evidence of what we've seen so far I think it might be hard particularly for for Kyle Walker as well as Alexander Arnold to get back into this England squad because Livremento I thought played really really well tonight he looked comfortable you know that was only his second start for his his country and he looked very much at ease this is going to sound daft but he likes full backs that are able to defend and he wants a full back the first thing with his full backs able to defend in a tight narrow back four but also give him something going forward and I think maybe with Trent Alexander Arnold I'm not necessarily sure that he trusts him defensively above what he's got in his squad now Jed Spence playing as a left back for Tottenham this season comes on tonight for his England Davies as a right back and in the process becomes the first player to represent England who is Muslim so kind of a huge watershed moment for for him as well in terms of that and I'm sure we'll hear more from him on on that so five different goal scorers for for England this evening there was a conversation we were having beforehand and I think Ian it was it was you who made the point about about Harry Kane that perhaps England were too reliant on him and not that he's unreliable but there maybe there weren't too many options outside of Harry Kane for England does five different scorers on the on the score sheet help to to solve that problem I think so yeah but also I think going back over the last 20 odd internationals England only the second time they've scored five goals so it's been a while since England put a team to to the sword if you like I think Ireland 5-0 last autumn was the only other time that it's happened in in in recent matches from an England point of view but yeah I think it does in that respect I think it will always please any manager when you get five different goal scorers and for Harry Kane I mean in the last 40 internationals he's played 33 Watkins has played five Tony who I think is going to struggle to get back into the squad just the want and he's got the option as well of his uh it was against Greece last October he played Foden in a false nine but if you speak to Thomas Tuchel Kelly he would say well Rogers can play there Rashford can play there Bo Boing could play there so they have got a number of options and of course the England captain Harry Kane is so rarely out of form he always delivers for England he's done it again this evening against Serbia with the opening goal in that five-nil victory here is the England captain with John Murray yes here he is Kelly Harry Kane congratulations that was a bit of a statement wasn't it yeah absolutely you know I spoke a lot yesterday about you know how we wanted to play and and being on the front foot and being aggressive and I think we showed our level today um you know even in the other games I feel like we've done well but we haven't quite reached and a top form tonight was totally different you come away to a place like this against a good side score five make it look really comfortable we can be really proud of proud of ourselves so it's been a great camp and we're in a great position now it's good right from the off wasn't it tonight yeah you could go all the way back to the first kick you know pickers we spoke before about trying to kick it into the box got in the box kind of had a little knock down and did nothing come of it but I think that was just the statement we had from the first minute we wanted to play in their half and put balls into their box we wanted to press high and that's exactly what we've done they found it difficult to play whenever they did break we recovered quickly and then uh yeah limited them to very few chances so yeah overall we can be pleased with the whole week I think and then we take this into the next camp and I know Thomas Tuchel said on Saturday night he said to us yesterday that he felt that it was coming but it's all very well-saying that isn't it you've got to do it yeah I think it's just a feeling we've had in the camp this week I think the energy has been higher I think the level in training has been higher maybe the motivation as well and yeah that we we felt that we had a good performance a few days ago I know it wasn't the performance everyone was excited about but we done what we had to so we was coming into this game with maybe a little point to prove to show that you know we can play at the highest level and we can make it really difficult for these teams sure be our really good team and we made them look average tonight so yeah overall you know we would just got a build on this we've got a good camp a stranger camp next one with a friendly and then a qualifier but we'll be ready for that and we're just building now hopefully until next summer yeah and five matches played in the group now one or five not conceded a goal you know qualification looks I mean it looked to have one foot in the states already yeah sounds good when you put it like that for sure but yeah no that's that's what we want and you know like it's never easy to qualify for a major tournament sometimes we've made it look easy over the past we're making this one look easy but there's a lot of work that goes into it there's a lot of mindset that goes into it a lot of pressure playing for England and and we've all handled that really well there's a few new faces in the squad another couple another debut tonight for for Jed so another first goal scorer right next to me here and there's I'll let him have that one so yeah look we're we're building something and look it's not going to be perfect but you know we can take nights like tonight with with great spirit and use that as a good energy lovely well done Harry and without further ado we'll go from the man who scored tonight his 74th goal for England to a man who scored his first goal for England Esri Konza well done great night for you yeah excellent night um like I've said in in previous interviews a moment I've jumped off since I was a kid and um you know you always you always dream about these moments and when you're when I was young I always pictured it you know trying to score for England so for it to finally happen and I'm a whole family watching back home it was a proud moment and uh I know I'll never ever forget that's where you wanted it as well wasn't it you were virtually standing next to the post of course definitely um I think you know in set pieces especially I said in the house we have to think like the attackers like like H and all the them up top so you know um it's something I've been trying to work on to to try and get more goals so um you know to finally score today uh it was an amazing moment yeah so so even though I presume you've spent almost all of your career as a defender even when you're a even when you're a youngster yeah you you still had that dream of actually scoring for England of course one million percent I think that's everyone's dream especially no matter where you play I don't know about goalkeepers I'll forget about it goalkeepers as defenders midfield whatever wherever you play but you know it's everyone's dream to score for their country and um like I said a proud moment and I'll never forget yeah and a good feeling for you all in the dressing room to produce like that 100% you know we've had a great weekend camp we showed our levels in training and and in both games so um you know like I said look we knew if we we came into the game with a right mindset and the same quality that we have been putting in for the last week we knew that we could come here and and get a victory and that's what we did today well done Esri you'll have sweet dreams tonight won't you probably won't sleep thank you thank you very much Esri yeah absolutely delighted John wasn't he about that about scoring that that goal for England his first goal for for England the third of England's goals um Phil Jagielka all defenders grow up dreaming of scoring a big goal for their country I bet you he didn't play in defense when he was young so I'll let him off he said he did no he said he did no way all of us started strikers surely no one to play in defense when he was young surely now fair play he's he's done really well every time he's played for England and I didn't realize it was his first goal obviously when he scored it today but that'll live with him that's a great moment I remember scoring my first goal and um yeah a massive proud one anytime you play for your country but to be able to get an added bonus especially to defender to get up there and score a goal and to be fair tonight every time a set piece came in we looked dangerous obviously scored from sort of three of them as well so I'm sure that'll delight the uh the set piece coach whoever that is lots more to talk about between now and 10 30 after England's five nil win against Serbia in Belgrade but we're just going to take a pause now and get the BBC headlines with Nick Hatfield",
