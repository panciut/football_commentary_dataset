[0.00 - 9.00] P:1884.57 E:0.323770 |  Oh no, we're absolutely right here. England must have won the toss. England have won the toss because they will attack down to this end in the second half.
[9.00 - 16.00] P:1948.71 E:0.305921 |  Here's the car coming. The remote control car is bringing the ball out to the referee beyond Kipers.
[16.00 - 23.00] P:1840.72 E:0.307132 |  Italy, blue shirts, black shorts, blue socks. We're about to get underway.
[23.00 - 33.00] P:1726.53 E:0.324813 |  Italy with Donoroma, Di Lorenzo, Bonucci, Chiellini and Emerson, Perala, Giorginio and Barati, Chiesa, Immobile and Insegnan.
[33.00 - 43.00] P:1763.42 E:0.334525 |  And England with Pickford, Walker-Stones and McGuire, 343, Trivia, Phillips, Rice and Shaw, Mount, Sterling and Payne.
[43.00 - 52.00] P:1880.10 E:0.343205 |  It will be Italy who get the Euro 2020 final underway after the players taking knee and applause all around Wendley Stadium for that.
[52.00 - 59.00] P:1994.33 E:0.334810 |  The players of both sides joining in with the gesture. And here we are. The moment has arrived at Wendley.
[59.00 - 72.00] P:1947.66 E:0.345135 |  This is the biggest football match for England for 55 years. The biggest sporting occasion this country has stayed since 1966.
[72.00 - 84.00] P:1975.89 E:0.335353 |  Say some, certainly the biggest football match. At England, balling white, playing from right to left, win the ball back for the first time on the half-way line.
[84.00 - 92.00] P:1965.48 E:0.333498 |  Calvin Phillips with a touch and the ball is deflected out of play for a joint at England, 5 or 6 yards inside the Italian half.
[92.00 - 100.00] P:1995.55 E:0.343894 |  But is Italy against England in the final year at Wendley? The final is on BBC One Television tonight.
[100.00 - 105.00] P:1898.61 E:0.311825 |  You can listen to our excellent friends and colleagues, Guy Mbree and Jermaine Genus.
[105.00 - 111.00] P:1973.61 E:0.332621 |  Or you can watch with our 5-life commentary all synced up via the i-player and the red button.
[111.00 - 116.00] P:1988.26 E:0.343764 |  And you can also get involved on the BBC Sport website live pages.
[116.00 - 125.00] P:2000.54 E:0.328872 |  The match is underway, the final is underway. Oh, there's a heavy touch by Maguire who turned under pressure and has passed the ball straight out of play for a corner.
[125.00 - 131.00] P:1939.18 E:0.324025 |  And exchanges words with Jordan Pickford. But what an unforced error that was by Harry Maguire.
[131.00 - 140.00] P:1981.39 E:0.347030 |  Very, very shaky start from England and Harry Maguire trying to pass the ball back to Jordan Pickford. Straight out play, Italian corner.
[140.00 - 145.00] P:1998.37 E:0.319070 |  Italian corner from the right. So England have got to be strong here in the early stages.
[145.00 - 150.00] P:1941.01 E:0.324473 |  In the second minute it's going to be taken by little Insignia. Lots of Italian movement.
[150.00 - 157.00] P:1973.65 E:0.322203 |  In it comes towards the penalty spot and it's cleared away by Harry Maguire who got their first on the volley.
[157.00 - 162.00] P:1975.11 E:0.304815 |  Towards the half-way line, Mason Mount is there. More Chelsea players in this.
[162.00 - 167.00] P:1979.69 E:0.334842 |  Italian starting line-up and there are England players in the England team.
[167.00 - 173.00] P:2011.39 E:0.326542 |  Harry Kane takes it on into the centre-circle. Here's the ball out to Trippier on the right-hand side.
[173.00 - 179.00] P:2021.08 E:0.335172 |  Trippier with a cross towards the back post. Sure scores from the volley.
[179.00 - 187.00] P:1970.74 E:0.340466 |  England lead in the second minute of the final. What a finish by the Manchester United man.
[187.00 - 194.00] P:1896.43 E:0.352493 |  That was wing back to wing back. The left foot finish. What a start for England in the final.
[194.00 - 204.00] P:1882.54 E:0.360687 |  Italy Hill in the one. Well from one end to the other. It's a devastating break from England.
[204.00 - 212.00] P:1828.85 E:0.335651 |  Harry Kane taking the ball from deep and passing the ball out to the right-hand side.
[212.00 - 221.00] P:1876.94 E:0.334743 |  Here in Trippier who does so so well. Sure in the game. Kane on the half-turn inside his half.
[221.00 - 227.00] P:1838.31 E:0.346118 |  Drops the ball out to the right-hand side. Walkers with the overlap.
[227.00 - 231.00] P:1875.61 E:0.310649 |  Takes a man with him and Trippier stands the ball up far post.
[231.00 - 237.00] P:1889.78 E:0.317189 |  Look, sure. Six yards out on the half-volley. Controls it brilliantly with his left foot.
[237.00 - 241.00] P:1883.27 E:0.317655 |  The ball sails over De Lorenzo's head and it's laces from shore.
[241.00 - 248.00] P:1931.35 E:0.328172 |  In off the near post. No chance for Donnarumma. What a start from England.
[248.00 - 256.00] P:1955.53 E:0.331315 |  What a time to score your first goal for England Luke Shaw. It's his birthday tomorrow. He's 26.
[256.00 - 266.00] P:1936.60 E:0.333820 |  What a controlled finish. You said it Chris Sutton. He didn't rush at it. He just measured it and hit it on the bounce.
[266.00 - 272.00] P:1936.87 E:0.336016 |  It kissed the post and Flupas Donnarumma. So England lead by one goal to nil.
[272.00 - 276.00] P:1900.23 E:0.319133 |  Not for sterling through the middle but that's won by Chiellini.
[276.00 - 284.00] P:1887.93 E:0.338469 |  And England in front. England against the Italians. The Italians on this 33-match unbeaten run.
[284.00 - 291.00] P:1866.89 E:0.331766 |  And they've not conceded more than one goal in any of their last 36 matches.
[291.00 - 297.00] P:1893.36 E:0.327339 |  But they've already conceded in this one. Harry McGuire after that nervy-only moment. Pets the ball down.
[297.00 - 305.00] P:1956.27 E:0.333448 |  Declan Rice now mount is impeded. And that's a free kick which is given by referee Bjorn Kipers.
[305.00 - 309.00] P:1969.00 E:0.319359 |  That was his clubmate, Giorgio Gigno. He won the free kick from.
[312.00 - 315.00] P:2011.87 E:0.348257 |  What a start. What a noise.
[315.00 - 321.00] P:1975.88 E:0.338287 |  Echoing around Wembley Stadium. Mason Matt was actually started on the left-hand side.
[321.00 - 327.00] P:1950.68 E:0.324203 |  We thought he was going to start off the right and sterling on the left for England.
[327.00 - 334.00] P:1953.38 E:0.328940 |  Maybe Harry McGuire had a plan, John, when he kicked out for a corner for Italy early on.
[334.00 - 338.00] P:1897.68 E:0.322336 |  You think so? Lull him into a false sense of security.
[338.00 - 342.00] P:1861.04 E:0.318016 |  Well, McGuire strikes this free kick now down the left-hand side. That's where Harry Kane is.
[342.00 - 346.00] P:1882.06 E:0.312165 |  He's up against the Italian right back, Di Lorenzo.
[346.00 - 357.00] P:1911.55 E:0.341027 |  And then Incomes the challenging Mason hand, which sent Giorgio Gigno spiralling to the ground.
[357.00 - 359.00] P:1844.48 E:0.311637 |  And he won a free kick.
[359.00 - 360.00] P:1697.48 E:0.335377 |  Absolutely.
[360.00 - 365.00] P:1872.13 E:0.330212 |  No, interesting, isn't it? We talked about team selection.
[365.00 - 372.00] P:1826.10 E:0.318729 |  Trippier coming in for Saka. Has Gareth gambled again. It was Trippier with the cross, wasn't it?
[372.00 - 376.00] P:1888.73 E:0.335428 |  For Luke Shaw, wing back to wing back.
[376.00 - 378.00] P:1856.54 E:0.334134 |  And England ahead.
[378.00 - 385.00] P:1894.68 E:0.335303 |  Well, if you're on your way home and you've just switched on, you've missed the opening goal of the final.
[385.00 - 388.00] P:1905.64 E:0.339657 |  And then Calvin Phillips has picked up for a foul in the centre-circle.
[388.00 - 393.00] P:1918.58 E:0.325322 |  The referee is going to have a firm word with Calvin Phillips, but no more than that.
[393.00 - 395.00] P:1904.58 E:0.292943 |  That was Porella again on the wrong end of that challenge.
[395.00 - 400.00] P:1901.98 E:0.317861 |  So 1-0 to England. Five live and BBC sounds.
[400.00 - 407.00] P:1899.79 E:0.332952 |  The World Service are with us. And so are many of the BBC local radio stations around England.
[407.00 - 412.00] P:2001.56 E:0.335263 |  So welcome to you all from Wendley Stadium under great skies.
[412.00 - 418.00] P:1949.61 E:0.325720 |  The smoke of the red arrows has disappeared and Italy are on the attack down the right-hand side with Chiesa.
[418.00 - 421.00] P:1969.22 E:0.331097 |  But England clearing away. Huge cheer.
[421.00 - 426.00] P:1937.68 E:0.326016 |  Again, around 65,000 inside Wendley Stadium for the final.
[426.00 - 430.00] P:1950.42 E:0.331426 |  Second man hitting it forward. Declan Rice then wins ahead of him.
[430.00 - 433.00] P:1932.75 E:0.329958 |  And Chiesa's got it back. And Chiesa up to the edge of the penalty area.
[433.00 - 437.00] P:1970.77 E:0.321804 |  Shaw comes into the challenge. Kicks him down. It's a free kick to Italy.
[437.00 - 442.00] P:1942.28 E:0.318082 |  That was quite a heavy challenge by Shaw on Chiesa, who's still sitting on his backside.
[442.00 - 444.00] P:1948.72 E:0.328027 |  But it's just a free kick.
[444.00 - 448.00] P:1968.49 E:0.320723 |  Shaw commits. Chiesa does really well. Diminishes player.
[448.00 - 453.00] P:1955.22 E:0.326559 |  Good dribbler off the right-hand side. Starting off the right-hand side for Italy.
[453.00 - 461.00] P:1963.71 E:0.328253 |  But this is within range. 25 yards out. Right-hand side of the box.
[461.00 - 466.00] P:1985.24 E:0.344166 |  Little insignia over the ball.
[466.00 - 470.00] P:1932.34 E:0.327517 |  Signia is over the ball. And so is Emerson as well.
[470.00 - 474.00] P:1960.44 E:0.325940 |  Emerson is actually striding it out as if he's going to hit it.
[474.00 - 479.00] P:1937.35 E:0.346971 |  Jordan Pickford is standing on his left post. So the angle is from the right.
[479.00 - 483.00] P:2044.42 E:0.348523 |  An England wall of four. There's a man sitting behind it.
[483.00 - 488.00] P:2014.00 E:0.351927 |  It's Insignia who curls it over the wall. But over the bar as well.
[488.00 - 495.00] P:1990.42 E:0.318237 |  An England survived that first scary moment and continued to lead by one goal to nil.
[495.00 - 500.00] P:1947.12 E:0.310267 |  The early goal from Luke Shaw of all people that scored a goal in the final.
[500.00 - 502.00] P:1950.74 E:0.289887 |  Down pitch side again. The Karen Kearney.
[502.00 - 505.00] P:1866.18 E:0.294349 |  Well he has to start England to start like the Red Arrows.
[505.00 - 510.00] P:1866.74 E:0.309798 |  Wow what a start that was. If you go and watch the goal you should see Kyle Walker and Trippier.
[510.00 - 514.00] P:1921.88 E:0.293168 |  Soon as K get it they're on their bike. They're going in. Fantastic as you said.
[514.00 - 517.00] P:1834.22 E:0.309931 |  Wing back to wing back. But now I see the attitude in England players.
[517.00 - 523.00] P:1884.55 E:0.280628 |  Calm down. Garasov gate. The back five. Relax. Let's calm it down now.
[523.00 - 529.00] P:1934.48 E:0.317861 |  I must say I'm already thinking back to Moscow and the semi-final against Croatia in the World Cup.
[529.00 - 533.00] P:2011.30 E:0.341556 |  When England took an early lead and those euphoria there.
[533.00 - 536.00] P:2001.02 E:0.326939 |  And then things slowly really went downhill.
[536.00 - 540.00] P:1928.46 E:0.326607 |  Come on John. Just a word of caution Chris. That's all.
[540.00 - 547.00] P:1891.17 E:0.311535 |  Garasov gate you'll be delighted Chris. He's got his back tonight.
[547.00 - 551.00] P:1869.10 E:0.325848 |  He has on this rainy north London evening.
[551.00 - 554.00] P:1865.61 E:0.336048 |  Here's the goal scorer. The new hero Luke Shaw.
[554.00 - 559.00] P:1908.45 E:0.306072 |  Totally out of the picture before Christmas in terms of an England comeback.
[559.00 - 566.00] P:1866.73 E:0.316515 |  And now here he is starting the final. Shaw Bertol Carlos himself scoring the goal for England.
[566.00 - 569.00] P:1923.38 E:0.301065 |  Yeah I wonder what Joe's like made of that.
[569.00 - 576.00] P:1978.49 E:0.339542 |  Yes. He has Sterling. Sterling is bundled over just near the centre.
[576.00 - 579.00] P:1912.11 E:0.317722 |  Kealini's getting him up with a headlock.
[581.00 - 584.00] P:1931.83 E:0.299925 |  Lovely touch. Lovely that.
[584.00 - 589.00] P:1881.76 E:0.328409 |  He was very hands on Kealini on Sterling as he tried to lift him up.
[589.00 - 592.00] P:1962.46 E:0.333787 |  So it is that one nail to England.
[592.00 - 596.00] P:2002.30 E:0.325598 |  Here's Luke Shaw who plays the ball into the body of Di Lorenzo.
[596.00 - 599.00] P:1954.78 E:0.317978 |  And it's a throw into England down the left.
[599.00 - 601.00] P:1988.34 E:0.309733 |  Shaw is going to take.
[601.00 - 605.00] P:1913.43 E:0.326341 |  It smells like kodite in the air.
[605.00 - 609.00] P:1933.55 E:0.326953 |  I don't know if small poms were let off when England scored.
[609.00 - 615.00] P:1919.19 E:0.326392 |  But the noise was absolutely incredible when that goal went in.
[615.00 - 620.00] P:1909.11 E:0.320305 |  I mean the people inside the stadium were pumped up enough because of the opening ceremony.
[620.00 - 624.00] P:1837.01 E:0.311210 |  The red arrows of course. Seeing England come out. The anthem.
[624.00 - 628.00] P:1838.51 E:0.294626 |  And then that finish from Luke Shaw. Here is Shaw. To Kane.
[628.00 - 631.00] P:1838.39 E:0.322335 |  Kane now moving inside. Four goals in the tournament.
[631.00 - 634.00] P:1981.07 E:0.337086 |  It's Walker who slips the ball through to Trippia.
[634.00 - 637.00] P:1960.34 E:0.324441 |  Trippia's ball across. It's just blocked on the edge of the six yard box.
[637.00 - 639.00] P:1892.50 E:0.327832 |  An Italy area with a cure in the way.
[639.00 - 643.00] P:1999.82 E:0.330321 |  Oh and then Walker. Another dive in there.
[643.00 - 645.00] P:1988.43 E:0.340019 |  And that is a free kick.
[645.00 - 648.00] P:1972.97 E:0.334138 |  It's actually the second challenge that came in from Trippia.
[648.00 - 651.00] P:1891.05 E:0.320916 |  Walker I think with the initial foul and referee Capers.
[651.00 - 653.00] P:1852.73 E:0.326736 |  It's just going to have a word there as well.
[653.00 - 654.00] P:1968.82 E:0.317332 |  Italy free kick.
[654.00 - 655.00] P:1974.74 E:0.339606 |  What's a passing tyre.
[655.00 - 658.00] P:1958.98 E:0.336999 |  Walker often criticised for his distribution.
[658.00 - 662.00] P:1940.68 E:0.354915 |  The ball played inside in Signia to Trippia.
[662.00 - 665.00] P:1992.68 E:0.342999 |  He was on the overlap there. Fist in the cross.
[665.00 - 669.00] P:1990.93 E:0.341972 |  The Alini experience centre half right place at the right time.
[669.00 - 671.00] P:1905.43 E:0.328510 |  Made the clearance.
[671.00 - 673.00] P:1954.17 E:0.351723 |  Italy nail England one.
[673.00 - 675.00] P:1989.29 E:0.316402 |  BBC Radio 5 live. Live from Wembley.
[675.00 - 678.00] P:1965.23 E:0.335824 |  And Italy on the move. The ball played into the penalty area.
[678.00 - 680.00] P:2023.42 E:0.343986 |  But it's beyond the run of him over there.
[680.00 - 683.00] P:2017.72 E:0.318280 |  And Pickford is able to come forward and collect.
[683.00 - 688.00] P:1948.80 E:0.318353 |  The official timing of the goal. One minute and 57 seconds.
[688.00 - 694.00] P:1857.32 E:0.320123 |  And the FAA president. Prince William the Duke of Cambridge.
[694.00 - 697.00] P:1871.78 E:0.325373 |  The Royal Box on the opposite side of the stadium.
[697.00 - 700.00] P:1787.07 E:0.335642 |  The Duchess of Cambridge is there as well.
[700.00 - 703.00] P:1814.30 E:0.347550 |  She had a busy day presenting the trophy to Norbach Chokovic
[703.00 - 705.00] P:1861.80 E:0.337646 |  down at Wimbledon earlier.
[705.00 - 709.00] P:1927.24 E:0.321950 |  And Prince George is having another late night out as well tonight.
[709.00 - 712.00] P:1799.84 E:0.318818 |  Tom Cruise is in there as well.
[712.00 - 715.00] P:1780.80 E:0.331656 |  Kate Moss is also in the director's box.
[715.00 - 718.00] P:1646.91 E:0.328431 |  Cabello, Wayne Rooney. All the stars.
[718.00 - 720.00] P:1722.19 E:0.325172 |  He has Kane on the half way line.
[720.00 - 723.00] P:1744.69 E:0.327048 |  Kane turns and he's just caught there and it's a free kick.
[724.00 - 729.00] P:1769.42 E:0.330427 |  That's given up in a challenge came in.
[729.00 - 731.00] P:1670.01 E:0.340031 |  Verratti wasn't it?
[731.00 - 733.00] P:1646.64 E:0.322868 |  Verratti, yeah.
[733.00 - 735.00] P:1605.10 E:0.311572 |  Kane snapping and snarling.
[735.00 - 738.00] P:1762.19 E:0.336281 |  Verratti, Kane winning the free kick.
[738.00 - 743.00] P:1819.33 E:0.324217 |  And I think Kane just followed through when he was brought down.
[743.00 - 747.00] P:1887.07 E:0.344545 |  A little collision with Varela who's moving.
[747.00 - 750.00] P:1856.06 E:0.347313 |  Three gingerly. Just watching the goal again from shore.
[750.00 - 752.00] P:1886.01 E:0.330103 |  It's an incredible finish.
[752.00 - 755.00] P:1863.60 E:0.343435 |  Normally players would open the foot out.
[755.00 - 758.00] P:1879.56 E:0.350972 |  So our little side foot half volley finish.
[758.00 - 760.00] P:1903.56 E:0.336809 |  Lucho laces it.
[760.00 - 763.00] P:1836.32 E:0.351334 |  Laces it to brilliant effect.
[763.00 - 765.00] P:1791.47 E:0.337827 |  Maguire takes the free kick.
[765.00 - 769.00] P:1694.82 E:0.334927 |  And play gets underway again with England 1-0 up in the final.
[769.00 - 773.00] P:1925.82 E:0.351185 |  Harry Kane works away and then plays a lovely ball out to the right-hand side.
[773.00 - 776.00] P:1926.57 E:0.322414 |  Trippie with a control. The cross-leads over the top of Sterling.
[776.00 - 779.00] P:1900.37 E:0.349303 |  However, Dealer ends off the back post and the no particular pressure
[779.00 - 781.00] P:1922.16 E:0.322684 |  puts it out for a corner.
[781.00 - 783.00] P:1915.99 E:0.343554 |  But that was another argument for England.
[783.00 - 786.00] P:1830.05 E:0.332404 |  And Kane coming deep. A little nutmeg in midfield.
[786.00 - 788.00] P:1923.26 E:0.336425 |  I don't know what nutmeg is.
[788.00 - 790.00] P:2000.16 E:0.335802 |  It's Allian.
[790.00 - 793.00] P:1928.58 E:0.334513 |  Spreads the ball out wide and Trippie on foot on his mind early cross.
[793.00 - 797.00] P:1866.06 E:0.340159 |  Sterling feels away beyond Chiellini but the ball a little bit too long.
[797.00 - 799.00] P:1918.27 E:0.296393 |  Dealer-Enzo takes no chances.
[799.00 - 801.00] P:1941.93 E:0.321884 |  Puts it behind.
[801.00 - 803.00] P:1863.02 E:0.310821 |  He didn't get it right this time, Trippie.
[803.00 - 806.00] P:1897.91 E:0.332574 |  But he got it right for the goal and that's what matters.
[806.00 - 810.00] P:1981.20 E:0.335247 |  And Trippie has come across to take the right-footed corner from the left.
[810.00 - 814.00] P:1969.38 E:0.347797 |  So England lining up the three big men, McLean, Stones and Kane.
[814.00 - 816.00] P:1985.56 E:0.325459 |  Here it is from Trippie out of the back post.
[816.00 - 821.00] P:1954.35 E:0.322836 |  Gunnaroma comes and he has a little juggle that makes a good catch outside his six-yard box.
[821.00 - 824.00] P:1932.38 E:0.338730 |  And then under arms it out and Italy are on the move.
[824.00 - 826.00] P:1954.59 E:0.341816 |  And there was a dive in the system.
[826.00 - 831.00] P:1978.42 E:0.346295 |  Overly again. He's better than that, John. He's not previous.
[832.00 - 835.00] P:1988.48 E:0.336865 |  Not sure he is better than that, Chris.
[835.00 - 839.00] P:1969.86 E:0.338602 |  Here's Stones passing the ball forward to Sterling.
[839.00 - 843.00] P:1951.47 E:0.336058 |  The local hero takes the ball on now, running at the Italian defence.
[843.00 - 845.00] P:1977.54 E:0.328175 |  What a start this is to the final.
[846.00 - 852.00] P:1937.09 E:0.327394 |  The atmosphere, the vibrancy inside Wendley under the arch is quite something to behold.
[852.00 - 856.00] P:1892.41 E:0.321637 |  Here's Rice now giving it to Mason Moode.
[856.00 - 860.00] P:1945.28 E:0.350430 |  And then back into the centre of the field to Declan Rice.
[860.00 - 862.00] P:2005.84 E:0.337615 |  Calvin Pillins with a touch.
[862.00 - 866.00] P:1996.81 E:0.344286 |  Shaw, lovely ball from Shaw into the space for Mount.
[866.00 - 870.00] P:1957.15 E:0.334055 |  Mount now takes on the defender as the challenge comes in.
[870.00 - 873.00] P:1950.37 E:0.342421 |  Morella who is back in there and bounces behind the referee.
[873.00 - 875.00] P:1930.95 E:0.340870 |  Kaitlin says corner England.
[875.00 - 877.00] P:1949.41 E:0.338559 |  Chelsea on Chelsea again.
[877.00 - 878.00] P:1844.15 E:0.321107 |  Virginia on Mason.
[878.00 - 882.00] P:1913.96 E:0.330088 |  Now lovely first touch from Luke Shaw as the ball was popped out.
[882.00 - 884.00] P:2003.46 E:0.324866 |  Jim on the left hand touch line.
[884.00 - 888.00] P:1946.06 E:0.328861 |  Mount had made the run beyond but Deano got back.
[888.00 - 891.00] P:1936.99 E:0.329079 |  Michael Block another corner for England.
[891.00 - 894.00] P:1925.01 E:0.323659 |  Interesting this, Chris, after Donnaroma came for the first one.
[896.00 - 900.00] P:1888.24 E:0.328929 |  And Harry Maguire has just got a message for Kieran Trippier.
[900.00 - 903.00] P:1898.95 E:0.328921 |  He actually walks across the penalty area and shouts.
[903.00 - 905.00] P:1928.12 E:0.309506 |  I'm not sure how he's going to make himself heard.
[905.00 - 907.00] P:1935.05 E:0.318204 |  Trippier holds both arms in the air.
[907.00 - 909.00] P:1823.79 E:0.325225 |  The run is to the near post.
[909.00 - 912.00] P:1859.69 E:0.301310 |  Here's to delivering which is headed away for Italy towards Shaw.
[912.00 - 914.00] P:1838.69 E:0.299025 |  He just pops it back over the top.
[914.00 - 916.00] P:1996.75 E:0.311670 |  What a pass that was from Shaw.
[916.00 - 917.00] P:1924.34 E:0.297953 |  Now Trippier again.
[917.00 - 918.00] P:1912.15 E:0.297800 |  Now Mount.
[918.00 - 922.00] P:1964.04 E:0.331884 |  Mount's ball into the box too close to Donnaroma who's able to gather the ball in.
[922.00 - 925.00] P:1966.61 E:0.319708 |  And the score remains Italy-nil.
[925.00 - 926.00] P:1924.73 E:0.319139 |  England won.
[926.00 - 934.00] P:1987.16 E:0.355114 |  Luke Shaw has just become the first man to score for England in a final since 1966.
[934.00 - 942.00] P:2011.70 E:0.335658 |  Indeed the first man who doesn't play for West Ham to score for England in a major final.
[942.00 - 953.00] P:1963.29 E:0.351179 |  So Manchester United are off the mark for England on the goal scoring stakes in the major tournament final football.
[953.00 - 956.00] P:1950.00 E:0.329696 |  The whistles because Italy are in possession.
[956.00 - 961.00] P:1938.86 E:0.312239 |  This won't ruffle them of course, but maybe it has ruffled them slightly.
[961.00 - 963.00] P:1965.44 E:0.339715 |  Here's Dilorenzo on the right.
[963.00 - 966.00] P:2008.95 E:0.337381 |  I'm not sure anything can ruffle Roberto Mancini.
[966.00 - 970.00] P:2017.80 E:0.351663 |  Now Veracchi plays it through to the edge of the box.
[970.00 - 974.00] P:1990.19 E:0.329230 |  It's taken infield by Emma Sisson.
[974.00 - 977.00] P:1882.77 E:0.315885 |  It just runs into Rice who whacks it away downfield.
[977.00 - 982.00] P:1945.83 E:0.327888 |  That's where Rice has been outstanding in this tournament.
[982.00 - 986.00] P:1955.81 E:0.332899 |  He's screening England back line.
[986.00 - 988.00] P:1913.45 E:0.330373 |  There he is again breaking the play up.
[988.00 - 994.00] P:1942.99 E:0.324368 |  Rice with the ball out of play after doing exactly what Chris Sutton describes.
[994.00 - 998.00] P:1795.65 E:0.315178 |  So 15 minutes on the clock, Italy nail England one.
[998.00 - 1002.00] P:1886.12 E:0.321017 |  And if ever there was a start that you wanted England got it Chris.
[1002.00 - 1005.00] P:1932.41 E:0.336055 |  Absolutely the perfect start.
[1005.00 - 1014.00] P:1958.69 E:0.340995 |  Mara Southgate and England players would have dreamed of now it's about seeing it through.
[1014.00 - 1017.00] P:1922.22 E:0.342062 |  Little Veracchi, a pair of signs you back.
[1017.00 - 1022.00] P:1911.35 E:0.330013 |  Gets the ball back centrally and then flips it out towards the left hand side.
[1022.00 - 1025.00] P:1924.85 E:0.309493 |  Veracchi gets it back but he's under pressure from Phillips.
[1025.00 - 1030.00] P:1948.56 E:0.337290 |  So uses the two experience, old stages at the back.
[1030.00 - 1035.00] P:1921.57 E:0.336416 |  The Elini and Benucci and then the pass over the top into the penalty area.
[1035.00 - 1038.00] P:2001.68 E:0.331742 |  The offside flag goes up against the run of Emma Sisson.
[1038.00 - 1044.00] P:1992.80 E:0.305899 |  Took it down and it is a free kick to England.
[1044.00 - 1047.00] P:1861.59 E:0.308189 |  Down to Pixar. What have you spotted Karen down there?
[1047.00 - 1053.00] P:1912.57 E:0.312688 |  A spot in Mancini's viewment is raging because England have tactically outdone Italy.
[1053.00 - 1057.00] P:1940.68 E:0.315627 |  And he's already sent a sub-sign 5 minutes ago to Walbot because they can't control it.
[1057.00 - 1060.00] P:1961.37 E:0.309009 |  Kane comes to feed and gets sub-tied with strips which are wide.
[1060.00 - 1064.00] P:1870.17 E:0.299360 |  Trippier and Walker swapping so they're not a pioneer attack inside of Italy
[1064.00 - 1066.00] P:1913.35 E:0.301938 |  but then pushing them the other way.
[1066.00 - 1069.00] P:1967.32 E:0.303293 |  He's thinking he's raging, he's going back to his bench.
[1069.00 - 1072.00] P:1954.22 E:0.302437 |  He might need to change it but it's still early though, I'll give him that.
[1072.00 - 1074.00] P:1950.23 E:0.335300 |  Italy nail England one.
[1074.00 - 1078.00] P:1944.57 E:0.317931 |  Pickford finds Shaw. Shaw now kicks it on down the left hand side.
[1078.00 - 1081.00] P:1935.85 E:0.303030 |  Goes past Perala but is pass out towards Mount.
[1081.00 - 1084.00] P:1940.23 E:0.322494 |  He's over hit this time. That's just about the first thing he's done wrong, look Shaw.
[1084.00 - 1088.00] P:1929.53 E:0.303750 |  After a brilliant start to the match and it's a good kick to Italy.
[1088.00 - 1094.00] P:1849.15 E:0.326640 |  Brilliant pass wasn't it from Jordan Pickford who I have to say I thought was slightly shaky
[1094.00 - 1098.00] P:1944.19 E:0.320970 |  in the game against Denmark but that was a lovely range.
[1098.00 - 1100.00] P:1913.65 E:0.317506 |  Find the back.
[1101.00 - 1106.00] P:1942.41 E:0.329835 |  Yes our reporter who's been at St George's Park throughout the tournament,
[1106.00 - 1109.00] P:1983.29 E:0.321622 |  Emma Saunders was telling me earlier that a training yesterday,
[1109.00 - 1111.00] P:1910.31 E:0.317611 |  England were working on that.
[1111.00 - 1115.00] P:1916.75 E:0.310257 |  The distribution from Jordan Pickford out to the two wing backs as they are.
[1115.00 - 1118.00] P:1921.86 E:0.326046 |  We've discovered Italy with the ball on the left hand side coming forward.
[1118.00 - 1123.00] P:1984.66 E:0.312091 |  The Azuri blue, stones gets up and heads that away on the edge of the box ahead of Immobilé
[1123.00 - 1127.00] P:1959.61 E:0.315502 |  and then the ball bounces out to the far side where Amerson has got to throw in.
[1128.00 - 1133.00] P:1957.43 E:0.322889 |  Takes it back and Italy move it in from the left hand side.
[1133.00 - 1135.00] P:1858.85 E:0.337793 |  Little insignia.
[1135.00 - 1141.00] P:1947.85 E:0.355256 |  Amerson playing in the absence of the injured Spinatola who are not this big here this evening
[1141.00 - 1146.00] P:1998.72 E:0.332891 |  on cheers because Di Lorenzo's pass is misplaced and rolls out of play
[1146.00 - 1149.00] P:1907.36 E:0.312203 |  beyond Chiesa for throwing to England.
[1149.00 - 1153.00] P:1864.28 E:0.302447 |  So it's great to see that Spinatola has been able to come to the match here this evening
[1153.00 - 1159.00] P:1929.75 E:0.318166 |  on his churches. Such an important part of this run at the tournament.
[1159.00 - 1164.00] P:2007.10 E:0.335910 |  There's no doubt that Italy will miss him tonight,
[1164.00 - 1167.00] P:1944.10 E:0.298170 |  missed him in that previous game.
[1167.00 - 1169.00] P:1933.86 E:0.307304 |  Set against Spain.
[1169.00 - 1175.00] P:1961.00 E:0.315463 |  Here with Amerson at left back, more of a feet at Panda than a Ferrari.
[1175.00 - 1177.00] P:2017.59 E:0.307637 |  Spinatola was.
[1177.00 - 1180.00] P:1953.78 E:0.319165 |  Italy nil, England won.
[1180.00 - 1183.00] P:1950.76 E:0.326930 |  And Italy now bringing the ball forward from the back.
[1183.00 - 1185.00] P:1976.71 E:0.351734 |  Konuchi's giving it away and the pressure.
[1185.00 - 1188.00] P:1939.08 E:0.313632 |  Rice closed him down and he's giving it to Sterling.
[1188.00 - 1190.00] P:1952.19 E:0.333696 |  Declan Rice works it to Mount.
[1190.00 - 1195.00] P:1867.10 E:0.298428 |  As Chris Sutton says, Mount playing mainly on the left hand side in the early stages.
[1195.00 - 1201.00] P:1963.21 E:0.322692 |  Ball played forward and it comes off Di Lorenzo and bounces out of play for a throw to England.
[1201.00 - 1207.00] P:1820.54 E:0.312852 |  Yeah, quite a fluid system that England are playing and there's quite an onus isn't there on the front to Sterling
[1207.00 - 1212.00] P:1830.92 E:0.306209 |  and Kane, Kane's just dropping deep at the moment and Sterling's taking up the position through the middle.
[1212.00 - 1216.00] P:1980.31 E:0.329450 |  Here is John Stones, one of England's men of the tournament.
[1216.00 - 1219.00] P:1839.00 E:0.316784 |  Sterling drops deep for this one and goes on a little run.
[1219.00 - 1221.00] P:1875.66 E:0.317777 |  Challenge comes in on him.
[1221.00 - 1225.00] P:1894.48 E:0.348447 |  From Giorgino and England go back into the back line again.
[1225.00 - 1227.00] P:1833.17 E:0.341065 |  He has Walker on the right, Walker and Trivia.
[1227.00 - 1232.00] P:1904.54 E:0.324457 |  England 343, Garra Southgate nicking a change with the system for this match.
[1232.00 - 1238.00] P:1951.38 E:0.332732 |  And then the free kick is given for DeFalle on Harry Kane near the halfway line over on the right in England.
[1238.00 - 1245.00] P:2005.26 E:0.336613 |  A free kick there after just a little challenge from Kealini.
[1245.00 - 1247.00] P:2020.72 E:0.347517 |  I'm not sure there was an awful lot in there.
[1247.00 - 1254.00] P:1947.41 E:0.334427 |  I think there was enough Harry Kane surrounded by three Italian defenders Kealini,
[1254.00 - 1257.00] P:1928.66 E:0.330787 |  eventually making the contact.
[1257.00 - 1261.00] P:1946.81 E:0.345239 |  Kane coming short, dropping deep, giving Venuccia Kealini plenty to think about.
[1261.00 - 1263.00] P:1950.16 E:0.339513 |  I don't want to go in there with him.
[1263.00 - 1268.00] P:1890.31 E:0.318922 |  Free kick, Trivia drills it high to the left hand side to Shawl who takes it down, crosses it.
[1268.00 - 1272.00] P:1889.12 E:0.289530 |  He's looking for the run of Trivia down into the Italian fullback position.
[1272.00 - 1278.00] P:1984.78 E:0.330521 |  It's played back to the dead ball line and it's over to Kealini with Trivia arriving at high pace there
[1278.00 - 1286.00] P:1949.05 E:0.314531 |  and actually clattering into the Italian defender who put it out of play, Emerson, for a throwing to England.
[1286.00 - 1288.00] P:1959.51 E:0.338225 |  I think it is the case now.
[1288.00 - 1293.00] P:1916.53 E:0.321342 |  I would like to think certainly that the stadium is up to the capacity for this final.
[1293.00 - 1298.00] P:1940.12 E:0.340531 |  Looking around the three tiers, red and white in every direction.
[1298.00 - 1306.00] P:1899.22 E:0.334582 |  Apart from the end to end of the lower tier, that is where all of the Azuri blue of the Italian supporters,
[1306.00 - 1311.00] P:1947.21 E:0.323517 |  seven or eight thousand of them and the Italian Toricca Lawry as well.
[1311.00 - 1316.00] P:1898.02 E:0.315187 |  Pickford clearing it long downfield but Emerson is going to allow that to drift over his head
[1316.00 - 1321.00] P:1838.34 E:0.330458 |  and out of play and an Italian player has gone down injured near the centre circle
[1321.00 - 1325.00] P:1916.58 E:0.338417 |  and he's feeling it on the right side of his knee.
[1325.00 - 1328.00] P:1946.41 E:0.331500 |  Now this would be a big problem.
[1328.00 - 1333.00] P:1955.81 E:0.307832 |  Not sure whether that must have been in a collision, surely.
[1333.00 - 1337.00] P:1853.11 E:0.313533 |  And the England players are now just going over to the far side to get out of Southgate
[1337.00 - 1342.00] P:1891.31 E:0.310215 |  and the water bottles and let's go down pitchside while we have this stoppaging player to current Kearney.
[1342.00 - 1346.00] P:1901.86 E:0.320990 |  Look, I'm really impressed with our right hand side, Walker and Trippie there because
[1346.00 - 1350.00] P:1930.96 E:0.319260 |  you look at Italy's attack, it's very left sided and what you get with Walker and Trippie is
[1350.00 - 1355.00] P:1875.62 E:0.308038 |  they're both natural right backs or right wing backs so if it's in your Emerson do go forward
[1355.00 - 1361.00] P:1890.10 E:0.312408 |  they're both comfortable at flip-flopping so at times you see Trippie jump back and Walker go in the right square sack
[1361.00 - 1366.00] P:1877.21 E:0.318870 |  but then they've got the pace and the energy to just go forward like the red arrows I can keep saying.
[1366.00 - 1370.00] P:1867.46 E:0.309505 |  So we really aren't nullifying, they're left hand sided so they've got push in the back
[1370.00 - 1375.00] P:1831.12 E:0.312005 |  and we spoke about his formation, we have to push them back, don't be concerned about them
[1375.00 - 1378.00] P:1855.47 E:0.314846 |  it's all about us and that's what we're doing at the start again, he's brilliant
[1378.00 - 1385.00] P:1818.07 E:0.315054 |  and honestly Mancini is leaving because tactically we've done him so far.
[1385.00 - 1391.00] P:1877.28 E:0.334110 |  Giorgio Ginho is still down on the pitch receiving treatment and what is a showery night here
[1391.00 - 1399.00] P:1893.56 E:0.339937 |  at Wembley Stadium in northwest London and Roberto Mancini has had to put on a rain jacket
[1399.00 - 1405.00] P:1961.53 E:0.345796 |  and the dampness means that his hair is plastered to his head
[1405.00 - 1410.00] P:1895.34 E:0.338001 |  and this is a real concern of Giorgio Ginho, the key man in this Italian side
[1410.00 - 1414.00] P:1852.31 E:0.302159 |  scored the winning penalty and the shootout and the semi-final against Spain
[1414.00 - 1418.00] P:1899.36 E:0.318173 |  is going to be a doubt whether he can continue.
[1418.00 - 1422.00] P:1919.32 E:0.321699 |  Now he is walking off the field, he's walking rather carefully
[1422.00 - 1426.00] P:1856.37 E:0.317640 |  Roberto Mancini is making signals to the three substitutes
[1426.00 - 1433.00] P:1887.61 E:0.313499 |  and Giorgio Ginho has left the pitch but he's now sat down over there
[1433.00 - 1438.00] P:1941.69 E:0.320302 |  and is continuing to receive treatment so Italy playing just for the time being
[1438.00 - 1440.00] P:1942.09 E:0.327007 |  return then Chris Sutton.
[1440.00 - 1445.00] P:1953.83 E:0.326919 |  We know Rush to take this goal kick, just saw in the television pictures
[1445.00 - 1451.00] P:1976.60 E:0.329052 |  John, Tom Cruise and David Beckham, a little fist bump.
[1451.00 - 1455.00] P:1948.78 E:0.346189 |  England Mission impossible John.
[1455.00 - 1460.00] P:1847.01 E:0.318727 |  The cocktails tonight, it brings Harry on as they are.
[1460.00 - 1463.00] P:1915.84 E:0.318273 |  Italy with the ball down the right hand side.
[1463.00 - 1468.00] P:1966.23 E:0.327038 |  Chiaz is onto this, Chiaz are now low across the penalty area
[1468.00 - 1473.00] P:2003.67 E:0.324880 |  John Stones came across and was able to clear it partially away
[1473.00 - 1476.00] P:1886.02 E:0.318001 |  and then Harry Maguire finished the clearance, now Declan Rice
[1476.00 - 1482.00] P:1970.74 E:0.337849 |  and the noise has just continued as Rice finds Kane on a halfway line
[1482.00 - 1485.00] P:1993.98 E:0.343058 |  Kane just drags it back and plays it back to Lechore.
[1485.00 - 1489.00] P:1962.69 E:0.323326 |  They love that Kane dragging it away and playing it beyond Chiaz
[1489.00 - 1492.00] P:1878.09 E:0.313429 |  and England have got it halfway inside their own heart.
[1492.00 - 1499.00] P:1929.34 E:0.317156 |  How sharp does Harry Kane look? Criticism of him at the start of the tournament.
[1499.00 - 1504.00] P:1887.09 E:0.321468 |  He's absolutely flying, just watching Giorgio Ginho, he's not moving well.
[1504.00 - 1508.00] P:1913.23 E:0.322682 |  Yes he's returned to the field Giorgio Ginho.
[1508.00 - 1512.00] P:1950.73 E:0.342399 |  He's just a few yards away from Killer Enzo who heads it in field
[1512.00 - 1514.00] P:1993.17 E:0.349295 |  and he's headed straight to Sterling.
[1514.00 - 1517.00] P:1922.81 E:0.339439 |  Sterling now takes on and beats Giorgio easily
[1517.00 - 1520.00] P:1903.81 E:0.330894 |  and then Sterling plays it into Bernucci,
[1520.00 - 1524.00] P:1906.70 E:0.317939 |  Paul Snow on the edge of the penalty area and then back to Don Arrubo
[1524.00 - 1526.00] P:1996.06 E:0.333295 |  who clears left footed.
[1526.00 - 1531.00] P:1988.34 E:0.347595 |  Italy break away, England feel that should have been given as a foul on Kyle Walker
[1531.00 - 1534.00] P:1991.29 E:0.341735 |  and now Italy come forward and this could open up,
[1534.00 - 1539.00] P:2023.50 E:0.341563 |  Paul across the box, McGuire in place and McGuire's in the cutely on the right foot.
[1539.00 - 1545.00] P:2010.95 E:0.341996 |  Kyle Walker, Calvin Phillips might have got himself in trouble inside the penalty area as well
[1545.00 - 1550.00] P:2004.21 E:0.324169 |  but no as the challenge comes in, it's just deflected behind for an England goal kick.
[1550.00 - 1556.00] P:1906.57 E:0.303904 |  They do look at it. Italy down that left hand side, Italian Messi, Lorenzo Insignia.
[1556.00 - 1559.00] P:1945.87 E:0.328489 |  Looks like he can cause England one or two problems,
[1559.00 - 1563.00] P:1909.90 E:0.311332 |  always coming on the inside on that right foot and trying to slide a pass.
[1563.00 - 1568.00] P:1981.62 E:0.317542 |  And that time just off with the pass stones intercepted.
[1568.00 - 1573.00] P:1985.02 E:0.313967 |  Italy nail England one, BBC Radio 5 Live.
[1573.00 - 1576.00] P:1912.56 E:0.310026 |  There will be a 6-0-6 tonight at 5 Live,
[1576.00 - 1582.00] P:1916.72 E:0.316256 |  Thonin with Alistair Bruce Ball who even now will be looking up the Italian for Nutmeg, I'm sure.
[1582.00 - 1587.00] P:1996.24 E:0.313459 |  Chris Sutton, Terry Butcher's going to join you as well tonight, Chris, which is great news.
[1587.00 - 1591.00] P:1933.33 E:0.331884 |  Terry who's been involved, well obviously is right, of course in his England career
[1591.00 - 1595.00] P:1959.67 E:0.329148 |  but with us as well at BBC Radio Sport with England for many, many years
[1595.00 - 1598.00] P:1914.36 E:0.312993 |  so it's going to be great to have Terry on the programme tonight as well.
[1598.00 - 1600.00] P:1842.41 E:0.315245 |  I'll let you know when the lines are open for that.
[1600.00 - 1605.00] P:1912.75 E:0.308917 |  But play it back underway, England with Rice in the centre circle, gives it to his left.
[1605.00 - 1609.00] P:1893.30 E:0.325478 |  To Harry McGuire who just shuffles forward, now it's Luke Shaw.
[1609.00 - 1615.00] P:1901.40 E:0.324885 |  Goal scorer Luke Shaw, he'd never said that in an England international before tonight.
[1615.00 - 1620.00] P:1946.88 E:0.329669 |  Walker, Walker, high pass down the right-hand side for Trippio,
[1620.00 - 1623.00] P:2001.03 E:0.342279 |  threading an offside position for Holmes.
[1623.00 - 1628.00] P:1931.55 E:0.331862 |  The three-kick Italy and they will just kick it and pass it out for McBeth.
[1628.00 - 1634.00] P:1907.25 E:0.363561 |  It was a pass once again though, no trippy, it was offside from Kyle Walker.
[1634.00 - 1642.00] P:1994.39 E:0.354535 |  The raking 40-yard ball whistles because Italy are in possession.
[1642.00 - 1645.00] P:2026.19 E:0.361560 |  Balls played through the middle but straight to McGuire.
[1645.00 - 1650.00] P:1948.24 E:0.337206 |  McGuire is able to turn away from immobilised and played the ball through the middle
[1650.00 - 1654.00] P:2004.92 E:0.319174 |  but Italy have got it back in the centre-third.
[1654.00 - 1663.00] P:1963.12 E:0.350296 |  Here is Giorgio again, forward to the left-hand side to Emerson.
[1663.00 - 1668.00] P:1984.90 E:0.346168 |  Now back, centre-leaf, he only takes it up on the half-way line.
[1668.00 - 1677.00] P:2008.04 E:0.353623 |  The Italian captain, Bernucci to his left, 70 years of age between them, the two central defenders.
[1677.00 - 1681.00] P:2019.94 E:0.351446 |  Now 221 caps for those two players alone.
[1681.00 - 1686.00] P:2026.52 E:0.357609 |  Still a whistle because Italy are in possession, Beratti is able to work it forward.
[1686.00 - 1689.00] P:2019.41 E:0.344842 |  Honestly this is absolutely deafening.
[1689.00 - 1697.00] P:2051.63 E:0.350594 |  Beratti, now again through the middle, a shot from Encina, from well over 25 yards out.
[1697.00 - 1704.00] P:2005.19 E:0.311560 |  It just flies away, low, harmlessly wide at Pickford's right post, goal-kicking.
[1704.00 - 1711.00] P:1940.76 E:0.320565 |  Good little spell that for Italy, then Encina off that left-hand side, coming into a central area on the half-turn.
[1711.00 - 1717.00] P:1946.93 E:0.299224 |  Fires a shot, 30 yards out, scored a stunning goal against Belgium.
[1717.00 - 1723.00] P:1966.01 E:0.326719 |  It's going to happen, it looks like, it looks like Encina is going to be the spark.
[1723.00 - 1727.00] P:1960.37 E:0.310706 |  Kane tries to turn, but he's 10 yards inside his long half as the challenge comes in.
[1727.00 - 1734.00] P:1959.32 E:0.324170 |  England were alert, and the right-sided central defender as he is tonight, Kyle Walker, is able to step forward.
[1734.00 - 1741.00] P:1978.00 E:0.323154 |  Now it's with Shaw on the left-hand side, shorter, now to stretch, Gilorenzo put in pressure, and in comes Rice.
[1741.00 - 1746.00] P:1826.96 E:0.310929 |  That was right next to one of those microphones, I can see one of those great fluffy microphones.
[1746.00 - 1751.00] P:1939.80 E:0.334338 |  You're able to hear the cry of anguish from Gilorenzo as he fell to the ground.
[1751.00 - 1754.00] P:1996.99 E:0.360376 |  It's a very good forward.
[1756.00 - 1758.00] P:1959.44 E:0.350706 |  From halfway inside their own half, good.
[1758.00 - 1763.00] P:1925.06 E:0.334028 |  Stone steps in so easily, and gives it to Harry Kane, who has the look over his shoulder.
[1763.00 - 1769.00] P:1869.75 E:0.310144 |  Kane now to the edge of the box, and then turns, he's got white shirts either side of him, but he goes back to Rice,
[1769.00 - 1774.00] P:1930.95 E:0.332836 |  but now Italy are back in position, Shaw back to Rice,
[1774.00 - 1779.00] P:1991.52 E:0.352840 |  sterling on the edge of the box, Calvin Phillips comes across and gets a touch.
[1779.00 - 1786.00] P:2049.88 E:0.356322 |  Calvin Phillips, the Yorkshire Peele Hall, playing against Italy, and now Luke Shaw,
[1786.00 - 1790.00] P:2000.13 E:0.337252 |  falling field from Mount, but Mount's pass was straight at Georginho,
[1790.00 - 1793.00] P:1976.54 E:0.343537 |  and Italy have possession back again and bring to the wrong penalty area.
[1793.00 - 1795.00] P:1980.16 E:0.344804 |  One nil England.
[1795.00 - 1799.00] P:2013.11 E:0.344203 |  They're making a few passes, and then the ball popped out wide to Mason,
[1799.00 - 1805.00] P:1984.48 E:0.330487 |  and Mount is trying to play first time into Harry Kane, just not quite on the same wavelength.
[1805.00 - 1812.00] P:1970.98 E:0.335803 |  Harry Kane is causing the Italian defence, all sorts of problems for Lutti and Chirlini.
[1812.00 - 1816.00] P:2007.87 E:0.338593 |  They just don't want to go in with him, he comes short.
[1817.00 - 1821.00] P:1976.88 E:0.325084 |  Italy with it on the halfway line though, England-Bentrop back into position.
[1821.00 - 1829.00] P:1972.46 E:0.353769 |  It's Porella, Nicola, Porella, and he just won the league with Inter under Antonio Conte.
[1829.00 - 1835.00] P:1968.37 E:0.345880 |  Roberto Mancini over there, an Inter man as well, when league titles is the coach of Inter
[1835.00 - 1839.00] P:1977.57 E:0.340536 |  before he came to Manchester City for his great foul there.
[1839.00 - 1844.00] P:2006.89 E:0.339079 |  Shaw heads the ball away on the edge of the penalty area, and then Mason Mount is fouled
[1844.00 - 1848.00] P:1993.04 E:0.335182 |  and apports referee typers, a challenge from Guillarenszo.
[1848.00 - 1853.00] P:1959.74 E:0.328011 |  It does seem that the England have targeted Guillarenszo down this left-hand side,
[1853.00 - 1855.00] P:2010.72 E:0.335707 |  and he's conceded a free kick.
[1855.00 - 1861.00] P:2009.30 E:0.332473 |  Yeah, had a couple of ball games against Spain, against Belgium, got the run-around.
[1861.00 - 1865.00] P:1913.13 E:0.330859 |  I just think Italy are getting impatient in an attacking sense.
[1865.00 - 1870.00] P:1958.55 E:0.339002 |  A long crossfield ball there from Guillarenszo, trying to find Taser on that right-hand side,
[1870.00 - 1876.00] P:1967.97 E:0.323284 |  but easily cut out by Lutti or England out of possession saying we're happy to go into a back five.
[1876.00 - 1882.00] P:2033.45 E:0.339764 |  The two holding midfield players in front of us, they're protecting,
[1882.00 - 1885.00] P:1985.65 E:0.330764 |  England looking very, very solid.
[1885.00 - 1888.00] P:1995.82 E:0.318558 |  Wembley absolutely raucous tonight.
[1888.00 - 1894.00] P:1941.28 E:0.309110 |  McGuire playing the ball back to Shaw, Shaw keeps it in, the ball's driven forward,
[1894.00 - 1898.00] P:1933.07 E:0.289476 |  but McGuire comes forward and hoists the ball into the centre-circle.
[1898.00 - 1904.00] P:1896.26 E:0.348328 |  It's England defence, just conceded one goal at this tournament so far, that Gamsguard free kick.
[1904.00 - 1914.00] P:1979.97 E:0.348401 |  Coming into this match tonight, Italy have been behind in a match for only ten minutes in their last 24 matches.
[1914.00 - 1919.00] P:1947.86 E:0.335586 |  But now in the thirty-first minute, and they've been behind since the second.
[1919.00 - 1926.00] P:1990.23 E:0.346117 |  Jordan Pickford in the England goal without wishing to tempt fate, doesn't have a save to make yet.
[1927.00 - 1936.00] P:1990.78 E:0.349777 |  Italy into Giorgino, Chelsea man the Champions League winner, receiving it from his club mate, Emerson.
[1936.00 - 1941.00] P:1936.48 E:0.350662 |  Giorgino wants it again, seems to have shrugged off that knock on the knee.
[1941.00 - 1944.00] P:1779.23 E:0.332942 |  Now in Senna, carrying it forward towards the edge of the penalty area of the deck,
[1944.00 - 1946.00] P:1957.44 E:0.315321 |  and Rice steps in on the edge of the box.
[1946.00 - 1949.00] P:1900.07 E:0.323546 |  It's lost, or Italy have got it back inside the penalty area.
[1949.00 - 1952.00] P:1965.88 E:0.324080 |  Now it comes back centrally, but between two of the Italian players,
[1952.00 - 1956.00] P:1866.97 E:0.329913 |  and now Giorgino collecting the ball, gives it to Di Lorenzo.
[1956.00 - 1961.00] P:1871.57 E:0.331224 |  Now he has Kierza out on the right-hand side, just down in front of us.
[1961.00 - 1968.00] P:1915.35 E:0.344155 |  Kierza, three England players around him, and back it goes to Pirella again, he turns in field.
[1968.00 - 1970.00] P:1992.49 E:0.332963 |  A little touch from Baratti.
[1970.00 - 1975.00] P:1921.80 E:0.349435 |  Now the captain, Kierli, is out there ten yards inside England territory.
[1975.00 - 1979.00] P:1950.85 E:0.344830 |  This is a long spell of possession from the Italians.
[1980.00 - 1985.00] P:1910.68 E:0.339938 |  Baratti, still England just hold the line, Phillips closes down Baratti, comes back again,
[1985.00 - 1991.00] P:1893.24 E:0.339949 |  and Senna puts his foot on the ball, and looks for Kierli, he's almost joined the attack now.
[1991.00 - 1996.00] P:1932.24 E:0.356770 |  Giorgio Kierli, in Senna, bearded little figure.
[1996.00 - 2001.00] P:1886.13 E:0.334612 |  Now to the left-hand side, Emerson is there, takes a touch, uses in Senna.
[2001.00 - 2004.00] P:1937.18 E:0.347179 |  Now Baratti, but it breaks down near the corner of the box,
[2004.00 - 2008.00] P:2024.64 E:0.344947 |  and I think Emerson might have fouled Rice there, no, the crowd thinks so,
[2008.00 - 2013.00] P:1947.84 E:0.330441 |  but referee Kierla says play on, 32 minutes playing up Wembley, one nil to England,
[2013.00 - 2018.00] P:2000.78 E:0.343658 |  but a long period of Italian possession, is it going to come to anything?
[2018.00 - 2022.00] P:2006.72 E:0.337009 |  Yeah, it is on the edge of the box, the ball played forward down the left-hand side,
[2022.00 - 2029.00] P:2018.73 E:0.332914 |  Emerson tries to reach it on the side, and referee and the assistant say he didn't get there before he pulled it across,
[2029.00 - 2032.00] P:2027.12 E:0.334201 |  and it is a gold kick to England.
[2032.00 - 2037.00] P:1993.84 E:0.327212 |  Emerson in trivia having words, but really good spell of possession from Italy,
[2037.00 - 2043.00] P:1972.99 E:0.315964 |  but they didn't go anywhere with it, so very pridly in possession, but they're lacking that punch.
[2043.00 - 2046.00] P:1985.89 E:0.323256 |  What an occasion this is.
[2046.00 - 2052.00] P:1955.41 E:0.321880 |  England, who were involved in the very first international match back in 1872,
[2052.00 - 2059.00] P:1936.59 E:0.326120 |  but in the World Cup, which was first staged in 1930, and in the European Championship,
[2059.00 - 2065.00] P:1877.12 E:0.336795 |  established in 1960, and has been precisely one fine that England had appeared in,
[2065.00 - 2072.00] P:1939.52 E:0.334123 |  but until tonight, and that early goal from Shaw, as Kane heads it on to Sterling.
[2072.00 - 2076.00] P:1971.92 E:0.322426 |  Now, Mound tries to work it back to Sterling, but the Italians were there in numbers,
[2076.00 - 2086.00] P:2003.66 E:0.332124 |  but again that movement causing problems for the Italian defence, as Kieran Trivia bundles into Emerson,
[2086.00 - 2090.00] P:1986.77 E:0.318066 |  but that is not given as a free kick, I think the ball is already off the field.
[2090.00 - 2094.00] P:1997.48 E:0.317368 |  There's one-on-ball, Harry Kane beating Kierlin in the air, straight flick,
[2094.00 - 2101.00] P:2006.74 E:0.335010 |  Sterling on to it, releasing Mound, right-hand side of the box, and Mound trying to reverse pass to Sterling, not coming off.
[2101.00 - 2107.00] P:1979.71 E:0.292988 |  Italy nil, England won, just over 10 minutes to go to half-time,
[2107.00 - 2115.00] P:1972.20 E:0.314418 |  and this damp night for the final, what has been a richly entertaining tournament.
[2115.00 - 2122.00] P:1961.39 E:0.340553 |  Great memories that have been provided for the England supporters with this run in the Garret Southgate,
[2122.00 - 2128.00] P:1878.22 E:0.336058 |  Italy with the ball inside their own half, the ball is hit high across the field, taken down by Gilorenzo,
[2128.00 - 2135.00] P:1947.33 E:0.341153 |  El Porella, Kierza on the right wing, Rice comes in with a challenge, Rice in again on Kierza,
[2135.00 - 2140.00] P:2018.73 E:0.337681 |  but Kierza's got away from him, and Kierza now kicks it up to the edge of the area, and shoots that foot in,
[2140.00 - 2148.00] P:2007.05 E:0.323355 |  and that's the only way of the foot, of the post, goal kick, but Kierza won up on Rice there,
[2148.00 - 2155.00] P:1974.63 E:0.315973 |  absolutely crafty, Kierza gets away from short, and then Declan Rice, Rice gets back,
[2155.00 - 2161.00] P:1989.24 E:0.307543 |  and he hustle and bustle, goes through him, and he must be up 22 yards out, shifts the ball, left-footed,
[2161.00 - 2167.00] P:1967.37 E:0.307603 |  it was probably a yard wide of Jordan Pickford's near post, down to pitch side, Karen.
[2167.00 - 2172.00] P:1914.29 E:0.320354 |  As soon as he took that strike, I thought it was in, Pickford was rooted, so we were thankful that it just went wide,
[2172.00 - 2177.00] P:1917.81 E:0.310025 |  but Steyrds again a little bit anxious now in England team, Pickford say, look, we need to play in their half,
[2177.00 - 2182.00] P:1940.17 E:0.300686 |  we need to keep the ball a little bit more, but out of our half, because the pressure is coming onto us,
[2182.00 - 2184.00] P:1964.63 E:0.295171 |  and I'm sensing it as well.
[2184.00 - 2190.00] P:1992.75 E:0.331561 |  More from Karen Carney and Micah Richards at half-time, from here at Wembley Stadium,
[2190.00 - 2198.00] P:1888.94 E:0.312854 |  10 minutes to go to the break, Italy nail England one, McGuire hits the ball long to Luke Shaw,
[2198.00 - 2203.00] P:1971.03 E:0.332872 |  what a pass that was from McGuire, Shaw took it into his strike, a challenge from Borell,
[2203.00 - 2208.00] P:1892.86 E:0.324991 |  he's gone away from him, Shaw now plays it across to the back post, but the falling,
[2208.00 - 2213.00] P:1920.38 E:0.324849 |  Emerson is able to clear it away, back out to the side from which it came, and it's a throw into England.
[2213.00 - 2221.00] P:1974.23 E:0.313719 |  Yep, that united connection, long ball on the left hand side, Luke Shaw on the run,
[2221.00 - 2228.00] P:1979.70 E:0.301943 |  gets it, a crossing, brilliant crossing, across the six yard line, that's the last ditch clearance,
[2228.00 - 2233.00] P:1937.58 E:0.309882 |  it was Emerson, he got it away, Shaw takes the throw for England,
[2233.00 - 2239.00] P:1932.79 E:0.306815 |  he tried to give it him back, it was under pressure from Gila Renzo and falling, puts the ball out of play.
[2239.00 - 2243.00] P:1929.54 E:0.324590 |  If you've just joined us, the England team tonight, just one change from the semi-final,
[2243.00 - 2249.00] P:1926.65 E:0.321221 |  here in Trippia coming in, for Ucaio Saca, who's among the substitutes,
[2249.00 - 2255.00] P:1951.62 E:0.320853 |  Phil Folden sadly not able to be involved at all because of the foot injury and training the other day,
[2255.00 - 2262.00] P:1938.37 E:0.342831 |  or inside the Italian penalty area, the big goalkeeper who's on his way to Paris Saint-Germain,
[2262.00 - 2272.00] P:1951.39 E:0.333878 |  Donnarumma just putting his foot on it, the ball's played back to Bernucci and then to Donnarumma again,
[2272.00 - 2280.00] P:1908.68 E:0.336151 |  very patient from Italy, Bernucci into the centre circle, the flick from Emogale, it goes all wrong,
[2280.00 - 2287.00] P:1850.28 E:0.300660 |  Rice now to Kane, Kane 25 yards out, Italians all round him, the England captain then gives it back to the halfway line
[2287.00 - 2292.00] P:1971.40 E:0.311360 |  to Harry Maguire, then back to Kane again, I'm not sure he was necessarily expecting that,
[2292.00 - 2296.00] P:1900.49 E:0.323564 |  then the challenge came in on him from Borela and the ball's out of play,
[2296.00 - 2300.00] P:1949.58 E:0.336756 |  but what's given us an Italian throw, it's given an England throw in that,
[2300.00 - 2305.00] P:1934.60 E:0.317630 |  that's the difference in the two centre forwards Kane, is holding the ball in,
[2305.00 - 2313.00] P:1936.85 E:0.298904 |  linking up with his English team-mates have all gone into him, Oberle is bouncing off him.
[2313.00 - 2318.00] P:1981.85 E:0.327600 |  The whole thing tonight Chris has been frantic hasn't it, the action's been frantic, the atmosphere,
[2318.00 - 2323.00] P:2003.72 E:0.348109 |  there's this piece of action, Declan Rice coming in for the challenge,
[2323.00 - 2329.00] P:1982.53 E:0.345277 |  but it was all the run by Emerson who's slid into the challenge after losing control of the ball,
[2329.00 - 2332.00] P:1971.49 E:0.321752 |  and that is given as an England free kick half inside the Ron Haar.
[2332.00 - 2338.00] P:1981.39 E:0.324619 |  No great drama with that, spot on John, Emerson overran the ball, tried to retrieve it,
[2338.00 - 2343.00] P:1996.49 E:0.313826 |  he's actually thinking he's got a toe on the ball and catches Rice in the follow-through,
[2343.00 - 2349.00] P:1889.49 E:0.319253 |  and the England players learning from the Italians in previous games surrounding the referee,
[2349.00 - 2354.00] P:1950.69 E:0.302942 |  the dark arts John. There's a lot of talk about that yesterday Chris,
[2354.00 - 2359.00] P:1867.50 E:0.321777 |  and I think you can guess the answer, there's a, oh no no, no of course not,
[2359.00 - 2364.00] P:1952.60 E:0.328882 |  everything's above board, Harry Kane goes down under it, another challenge from Georgina,
[2364.00 - 2369.00] P:1961.28 E:0.336898 |  a free kick, Italy break forward, the offside flags up against the Norvalier this time,
[2369.00 - 2374.00] P:1930.31 E:0.329139 |  not great body language from some of the Italian players incidentally as the Norvalier was caught offside,
[2374.00 - 2377.00] P:1939.37 E:0.316702 |  but it's a free kick to England in front of their own penalty area.
[2377.00 - 2385.00] P:1944.84 E:0.320909 |  In senior once again, Sparks gets away from a couple of England midfielders in the Norvalier,
[2385.00 - 2389.00] P:1958.33 E:0.320817 |  it's just not happening for him this evening.
[2394.00 - 2401.00] P:1903.52 E:0.325792 |  He's continues to ring around Wembley Stadium. In actual fact, in terms of goal scoring opportunities,
[2401.00 - 2410.00] P:1954.37 E:0.309000 |  they've been very, very few, but the whole feel of the match, it's quite hair and scare, I think.
[2410.00 - 2417.00] P:1895.98 E:0.334900 |  England haven't been here for 55 years John, it's very good point Chris.
[2417.00 - 2425.00] P:1898.77 E:0.340506 |  The good thing is, so far the English players have looked controlled and composed.
[2425.00 - 2429.00] P:2004.69 E:0.320020 |  I think it's the fans who aren't.
[2429.00 - 2437.00] P:1937.80 E:0.336463 |  Well it's been a long Sunday, and here's Gilarengo playing a forward to Georgina through the middle,
[2437.00 - 2441.00] P:1919.31 E:0.322587 |  taken on by Barella, Barella looking to Emerson down the left-hand side,
[2441.00 - 2447.00] P:1876.12 E:0.319330 |  and that's push forward, I must say, when every can in senior back to Emerson now works it back,
[2447.00 - 2452.00] P:1993.80 E:0.327756 |  passes it straight to Calvin Phillips, who turns and then the ball up towards the halfway line,
[2452.00 - 2458.00] P:1938.38 E:0.309960 |  Harry Kane goes down under the challenge from Benucci, referee, Kaipo says play on.
[2458.00 - 2460.00] P:1876.90 E:0.298515 |  I'm not having that as a free kick for Harry Kane.
[2460.00 - 2468.00] P:1917.83 E:0.308377 |  Absolutely, 1v1 Benucci just reading the flight of the ball, better Kane going down, claiming for the free kick,
[2468.00 - 2470.00] P:1996.37 E:0.288284 |  but nothing in that.
[2470.00 - 2476.00] P:1911.71 E:0.327508 |  So it's a habit again, as we approach half-time, we're into the last five minutes of the first half,
[2476.00 - 2484.00] P:1946.09 E:0.317164 |  no question what the big moment of that first half was, and it came early after 1 minute 57 seconds
[2484.00 - 2494.00] P:2007.91 E:0.323998 |  from the left boot of Luke Shaw, Italy though, blue-shirted, shirts damp and dark with perspiration and grain,
[2494.00 - 2501.00] P:1935.60 E:0.329413 |  and then Barella is fouled by Mount, and Italy have a free kick out here towards the right-hand side,
[2501.00 - 2507.00] P:1889.19 E:0.304223 |  certainly a set-piece situation, whether it will be a delivery into the England penalty area,
[2507.00 - 2514.00] P:1917.84 E:0.303470 |  England have to organise themselves, Insignia comes across, Verratti is there as well,
[2514.00 - 2522.00] P:1936.51 E:0.318458 |  Verratti says to Insignia, no you just move away, I'm going to have this one, Verratti,
[2523.00 - 2531.00] P:1925.91 E:0.337278 |  created 12 chances already at Euro 2020, Verratti holds his right arm in the air,
[2531.00 - 2538.00] P:1946.04 E:0.323460 |  and here is the delivery, and it is headed away up and well by Stones, bounces down on the edge of the penalty area though,
[2538.00 - 2542.00] P:1905.23 E:0.311962 |  Giorgio Ginho gives it out to the left, plenty of Italians still in the England box,
[2542.00 - 2549.00] P:1916.39 E:0.303433 |  now Insignia, the ball hasn't been delivered in yet, still Italy have it on the left-hand side,
[2549.00 - 2556.00] P:1913.18 E:0.299798 |  Emerson, Trippia comes across, now out there on the left-hand side,
[2556.00 - 2562.00] P:1921.20 E:0.350356 |  Chiesa gives it back to Insignia, Giorgio Ginho, back to Verratti,
[2562.00 - 2568.00] P:1957.36 E:0.344229 |  Kyliani and Benucci have stayed up, they have, and Kyliani is making a run now into the penalty area,
[2568.00 - 2572.00] P:1908.21 E:0.319235 |  Rice has a look over his shoulder at him, but Italy still don't deliver,
[2572.00 - 2578.00] P:1983.99 E:0.315947 |  now the ball again to the left-hand side, Emerson with a cross but it was blocked away by Trippia,
[2578.00 - 2584.00] P:1920.69 E:0.314134 |  and it bounces into the canvases on the front-rolls on the far side, out of play for a throw to Italy,
[2584.00 - 2591.00] P:1897.09 E:0.280015 |  we're in the 40- third minute now, England leading by one goal to 0, 5-5, BBC 5-5,
[2591.00 - 2598.00] P:1911.92 E:0.313759 |  Underworld Service, listeners well by a BBC Sounds, if you're taking your dog for a walk in the rain on this night of nights,
[2598.00 - 2603.00] P:1994.87 E:0.326612 |  or the throw has been taken by Emerson, and Insignia, twistling and turning,
[2603.00 - 2608.00] P:1998.61 E:0.289531 |  it went straight through him, looking for a goal kick, that was awful for Insignia,
[2608.00 - 2618.00] P:1958.98 E:0.280095 |  he's been rating Emerson for a bad throw, terrible control, Roberto Mancini in the rain,
[2618.00 - 2624.00] P:1980.52 E:0.279919 |  he's got thinking to do because his side just, having troubled Jordan Pickford,
[2624.00 - 2629.00] P:1981.47 E:0.285745 |  that one effort from Chiesa but that was quite of the mark, it was,
[2629.00 - 2634.00] P:1890.18 E:0.296354 |  but England have played this on the front foot, but O'Rice England are the challenge,
[2634.00 - 2641.00] P:1974.38 E:0.297729 |  I'm all but, keep Borella through himself to the ground, forward for England,
[2641.00 - 2644.00] P:1892.62 E:0.306678 |  or Mount through the middle, I think he might have been caught late there,
[2644.00 - 2647.00] P:1916.91 E:0.317996 |  balling from the right-hand side, then Stirling goes down on the edge of the box,
[2647.00 - 2652.00] P:1937.41 E:0.318507 |  they're going down like nine pins, Donnarumma under-arms it out,
[2652.00 - 2657.00] P:1935.75 E:0.317345 |  I saw Rice try to pick up Borella, now Donnarumma is picking up Stirling,
[2657.00 - 2663.00] P:1939.77 E:0.316005 |  it's all terribly, terribly, Italy bring it forward, but Rice is able to take the ball away,
[2663.00 - 2669.00] P:1873.04 E:0.317762 |  Rice, lovely change of feet, Chiesa out of the game, now he's away from Borella and Rice,
[2669.00 - 2672.00] P:1925.81 E:0.311286 |  couldn't find the pass through to Stirling, but I think he was caught,
[2672.00 - 2677.00] P:1955.40 E:0.326120 |  well referee says no and in a rather exaggerated fashion,
[2677.00 - 2685.00] P:2003.29 E:0.323647 |  Bjorn Kupers the referee wafts his hand to Declan Rice as if to say get up, no free kick.
[2685.00 - 2691.00] P:1939.47 E:0.309828 |  Yeah, I think Declan Rice was trying to buy that free kick, he's got a yard of pace hasn't he Declan?
[2691.00 - 2698.00] P:1982.23 E:0.304024 |  Rice just keeps driving with the ball, driving the space to really good effect.
[2698.00 - 2703.00] P:1998.58 E:0.293955 |  Here's a pass for Italy for Insigna, Walker, Tate Onin, Trippi has there as well,
[2703.00 - 2706.00] P:1933.72 E:0.288816 |  it's in the full-back position, Insigna still going towards the dead ball line,
[2706.00 - 2710.00] P:1935.11 E:0.309107 |  then works it back, Phillips is out there as well, Italy roll, this could put to something,
[2710.00 - 2717.00] P:1999.59 E:0.329454 |  Emerson into the area on his left foot but then Stone stepped in and was able to just get his right foot to it to clear it.
[2717.00 - 2724.00] P:1988.51 E:0.319890 |  One nildo England, half-time approaching, we're in the 45th minute of this Euro 2020 final.
[2724.00 - 2732.00] P:1994.78 E:0.337652 |  England have led since the second minute, here's Berratti, England have dropped everyone behind the ball.
[2732.00 - 2736.00] P:1985.60 E:0.324140 |  We'll have more from Karen Kearney and Micah Richards with Mark Chapman here at Wendley at half-time,
[2736.00 - 2743.00] P:1998.23 E:0.319317 |  but Italy continuing to come forward, Barela infield towards Berratti and Berratti pass all the top,
[2743.00 - 2751.00] P:1994.60 E:0.322187 |  Insigna did get his foot to it to bring it down, the Trippi was there with him and clears it out of play near the halfway line.
[2751.00 - 2760.00] P:1951.81 E:0.334759 |  45 minutes almost up, England just a few seconds away from going in ahead at the break in the final.
[2760.00 - 2766.00] P:1877.07 E:0.327548 |  Four minutes of added time, we did have the Giorgio Injury, that was quite a lengthy stoppage,
[2766.00 - 2773.00] P:1741.82 E:0.319204 |  Four minutes of added time, Garry Southgate standing over there on the far side with his hands in his pockets,
[2773.00 - 2782.00] P:1934.64 E:0.303019 |  his black knack, buttoned up or zipped up, England take the throw and the ball bounces out of play,
[2782.00 - 2791.00] P:1930.11 E:0.311884 |  so you've got to throw, Calvin Phillips just touches the ball away as Emerson was arriving on the scene to take that throw in.
[2791.00 - 2799.00] P:1971.02 E:0.319733 |  Clever, had a little touch from Trippia, this elite, swing the ball to the right hand side looking for Kears,
[2799.00 - 2806.00] P:1989.69 E:0.328840 |  and it's Shoy's there and is able just to calmly hit the silver ball which is banging into the hoardings down in front of us.
[2806.00 - 2812.00] P:1983.27 E:0.316175 |  And the throw in is taken quickly by Di Lorenzo, Di Lorenzo now approaching the edge of the box,
[2812.00 - 2820.00] P:1982.42 E:0.296423 |  across his aim Kears, immobilised with a shot, that's blocked, edge of the box, Giorgio Injury, Verati shoots but lack power,
[2820.00 - 2826.00] P:2016.01 E:0.312255 |  it just dribbled through to Pickford who is able to drop down onto his knees and attack it dead.
[2826.00 - 2833.00] P:1945.59 E:0.299938 |  Yeah, he's just feeling the need half time, there's a good ball in from Di Lorenzo, immobilised, half volley catches it flush,
[2834.00 - 2841.00] P:1898.52 E:0.297687 |  not an easy chance, it's just behind him and John Stones, he's had an immaculate first half hasn't he, a Renaissance man,
[2841.00 - 2844.00] P:1895.79 E:0.289762 |  hasn't put a foot wrong yet, he gets the block in.
[2844.00 - 2854.00] P:1979.08 E:0.316381 |  He's had an immaculate tournament, Chris, here's Rice on the left hand side for England, we're in the 47th minute,
[2854.00 - 2864.00] P:1952.65 E:0.300924 |  we'll put that down as a chance certainly for immobilised, a shot that was hit into John Stones who just dropped down onto one knee,
[2864.00 - 2869.00] P:1881.23 E:0.305205 |  well it is a Sunday isn't it, I have seen the Pope is here tonight, the Pope, the Pontiff,
[2869.00 - 2875.00] P:1902.29 E:0.310931 |  the man dressed up in the table outfit amongst the Italian fans, came,
[2875.00 - 2885.00] P:1990.17 E:0.319420 |  playing the ball across the Italian half but Phillips can't reach it and now it's hit forward but there's no way that that's being reached
[2885.00 - 2890.00] P:1921.22 E:0.294797 |  by a more volley through the middle and England have got it back, the ball is passed forward but cut out on the half-way line,
[2890.00 - 2896.00] P:1967.68 E:0.318343 |  however the ball rebounds to Calvin Phillips as we get a waft of cooler air just over the top of our
[2896.00 - 2903.00] P:1881.48 E:0.296508 |  perfect screens in front of us here, temperature has dipped, I think that has helped with the tempo of the match,
[2903.00 - 2914.00] P:1919.95 E:0.306759 |  Declan Rice on the half-way line uses McGuire in the 48th minute now, Shaw slips the ball and now to Sterling,
[2914.00 - 2920.00] P:1947.10 E:0.327166 |  Sterling couldn't find Kane on the edge of the box in the D and Italy will break downfield,
[2920.00 - 2925.00] P:1927.78 E:0.304790 |  immobilised once the early pass, Barella in fact has gone to insignia on the left hand side,
[2925.00 - 2932.00] P:1978.71 E:0.307398 |  it's been taken up centrally by Chiesa but Phillips is in with a challenge there, excellent work to block the progressive Chiesa,
[2932.00 - 2943.00] P:2000.39 E:0.339637 |  Barella just kept in play down the left hand side by Emerson, back it goes to the centre circle, Giorgio,
[2943.00 - 2954.00] P:2125.14 E:0.341330 |  we're in the last minute and out of time at the end of the first half, Italy hoping they'll get one last chance in this first period,
[2955.00 - 2971.00] P:2002.88 E:0.320322 |  Di Lorenzo, now Bonucci is going to have a goal from distance but that sails away from 30 yards or more and there are accusing glances from a number of the Italian players towards the veteran Bonucci for having a goal from there.
[2971.00 - 2984.00] P:1935.39 E:0.297093 |  Well, I've seen him strike them in the past but this is optimism in the extreme and Roberto Mancini off the bench, he's furious with the decision making there,
[2984.00 - 2990.00] P:1876.11 E:0.319906 |  from Bonucci he should know better but I think England have defended deep and frustrated the Italians.
[2990.00 - 2999.00] P:1936.79 E:0.308689 |  Over there on the Italian bench, I'm now seeing those beautiful pale blue blazers being unveiled again as the coaching staff peel off their raincoats
[2999.00 - 3008.00] P:1997.30 E:0.328329 |  and gather at the mouth of the tunnel. Still we play on at the end of this first half, Chiellini's down on the half way line,
[3008.00 - 3017.00] P:2003.11 E:0.323494 |  Longbaugh played forward but referee Kipers says that's your lot and I mean the referee, beyond Kipers, all in pink,
[3017.00 - 3025.00] P:1808.20 E:0.308447 |  he's been a central figure because this has been a tough match to referee, he's needed all of his experience and Chiellini is getting to his feet
[3025.00 - 3034.00] P:1825.08 E:0.271243 |  and having a little word there with the referee but England lead at half time in the final thanks to that fabulous early goal from Luke Shaw, Chris Sutton.
[3034.00 - 3044.00] P:1826.34 E:0.259867 |  Yep, not a sure thing yet for England, still work to do but I think they've been very good in this first half, they've done an Italian job you could say defensively on the Italian team,
[3044.00 - 3050.00] P:1731.99 E:0.269271 |  Jordan Pickford very little to do, England go in, one nil ahead, 45 minutes left.
[3050.00 - 3054.00] P:1829.73 E:0.238337 |  Not a sure thing, are you sure about that? Down to Karen Pitchside.
[3054.00 - 3062.00] P:1582.93 E:0.251893 |  Just watching, there's been some altercation I think between the subs, the Italian goalkeeper there is going off in a bit of a half,
[3062.00 - 3068.00] P:1793.25 E:0.273856 |  frustrated but that sums up their first half, Italy England have been sensational but in particular our right hand side,
[3068.00 - 3075.00] P:1854.46 E:0.274119 |  Trippery and Walker because everything good at Italy do comes down their left hand side to Trippery and Walker, got to be on it at all times.
[3075.00 - 3081.00] P:1634.75 E:0.294680 |  As long as they nullify, he's seen the head, Emerson on that side, I'm telling you we'll win the game.
[3083.00 - 3087.00] P:1712.82 E:0.280050 |  Half time, it's Italy nil, England won.
[3088.00 - 3099.00] P:1978.47 E:0.313423 |  Thank you Mark and I do sincerely hope that there aren't people listening to us now in that cars who haven't been able to get inside here even though they had a ticket, that would be awful.
[3100.00 - 3111.00] P:1952.88 E:0.301674 |  So second half, England about to kick off, Raheem Sterling gets us underway and England playing from left to right in the second period as they like to do.
[3111.00 - 3120.00] P:1912.45 E:0.275067 |  That's where the Mast support is, that's where the England band are, that's where the supporters club, the England supporters club,
[3120.00 - 3124.00] P:1855.22 E:0.277116 |  that's where they are in great numbers just behind Karen Carney who's down at Pitchside.
[3124.00 - 3133.00] P:1898.53 E:0.284667 |  So Italy nil, England won and the teams as they were at the start of the match, so Donnaroma in goal for Italy, Di Lorenzo, Bonucci, Chiellini and Emerson back,
[3133.00 - 3142.00] P:1834.83 E:0.305052 |  Giorgino with Parella and Verratti either side and then Chiesa immobile and Insigna up front and England with Pickford in goal,
[3142.00 - 3152.00] P:1837.54 E:0.313052 |  three central defenders, Walker, Stones and McGuire, then the four, Trippery out Phillips, Rice and goal scorer Shaw, then Mount Sterling and Kane.
[3153.00 - 3160.00] P:1927.67 E:0.309453 |  England with Harry McGuire who just plants the ball out of play and actually kicks it into the assistant's flag on the far side,
[3160.00 - 3169.00] P:1970.68 E:0.298124 |  knocks it out of his hand, a throw in taken by Italy wearing the Savoy blue of Italy, shirts, black shorts, blue socks,
[3169.00 - 3174.00] P:1953.97 E:0.267356 |  crossed from the right, has blocked out of play, England ball in white tonight, red numbers on the back,
[3174.00 - 3180.00] P:1942.86 E:0.291254 |  that little stripe down the side of their shirts, the throw in is taken and it breaks down, the return pass straight out of play.
[3181.00 - 3190.00] P:1932.49 E:0.265360 |  From Di Lorenzo and it's a throw in to England in their own left back position, the camera, that camera on its strings hovering high above the pitch,
[3191.00 - 3201.00] P:1920.99 E:0.300871 |  the Wembley arch, grey skies beyond it is just beginning to be lit up in turquoise and here's Harry Kane now breaking away on the challenge came in and caught him on his right hand goal here,
[3202.00 - 3208.00] P:1968.66 E:0.312947 |  Borella and there it is, finally the first yellow card of the match, Bjorn Capers couldn't resist that one.
[3209.00 - 3223.00] P:1959.86 E:0.282931 |  Kane does brilliantly, ball in to him, turns, drives away on Borella, he brings him down, that to be a yellow card for Borella.
[3224.00 - 3230.00] P:1935.50 E:0.321303 |  It's good from Harry Kane though, that's what he has to do, hold on to the ball, link the play up,
[3230.00 - 3238.00] P:1885.12 E:0.325566 |  interesting to see how England approaches and half, double it at the second half, a little bit deep towards the end of the first half.
[3241.00 - 3248.00] P:1816.50 E:0.321538 |  Ball pumped forward and headed out of play, so Shaw will have a throwing for England, level with the edge of the Italian penalty area,
[3248.00 - 3256.00] P:1739.99 E:0.311915 |  Luke Shaw scored in the second minute, his first goal for England in his 16th appearance and Shaw now gets away down the left hand side,
[3256.00 - 3263.00] P:1961.79 E:0.312446 |  puts it back, he's on his left foot, finds Sterling in the box, Sterling now, but a throw on the challenge comes in, Sterling goes down,
[3263.00 - 3271.00] P:1929.35 E:0.308836 |  Sterling's pleading for the penalty, it was Benucci in with a challenge, the referee, Capers on the edge of the box through Brawlfarms into the air and said no.
[3271.00 - 3283.00] P:1995.03 E:0.275080 |  Well, no doubt they'll be checking it, well the referee with his arm in the air, Sterling, got to say, has previous, I think,
[3283.00 - 3292.00] P:1966.73 E:0.272582 |  England were fortunate to get the penalty against Denmark in the semi-final, maybe as the boy who cried Wolff looked like to be,
[3292.00 - 3298.00] P:1965.21 E:0.271366 |  there to be contact, but just how much did he need to go down, Raheem Sterling?
[3298.00 - 3305.00] P:1979.57 E:0.302762 |  Well, hit for a trip, stretches for it on the edge of the box, Pickford comes and just puts his left foot through it, hits it almost directly at us.
[3305.00 - 3310.00] P:1951.63 E:0.291710 |  He's still having words with the referee, and he's Sterling, here we are, with an angle on it.
[3310.00 - 3319.00] P:1912.27 E:0.300975 |  On our screen, it's not saying that they are looking at it, Chris, we're looking at it now, he's got Benucci's coming in on one side of him, what do you think?
[3319.00 - 3323.00] P:1903.04 E:0.265469 |  I think he overran the ball, on the rim, over there.
[3323.00 - 3327.00] P:1967.62 E:0.291912 |  So it's Italy with it on the right hand side.
[3327.00 - 3334.00] P:1953.55 E:0.303919 |  At no stage, they'll see on the screen that there was a DAR check, so, the on-cabers was adamant, that was the decision,
[3334.00 - 3342.00] P:1904.60 E:0.291052 |  and it remains Italy-nil, England won, Italy playing from right to left, towards their own supporters, who are all in the,
[3342.00 - 3349.00] P:1906.64 E:0.306339 |  mainly in the blue, the white and greener, dotted around the thousands of Italian fans.
[3349.00 - 3354.00] P:1922.42 E:0.298668 |  In Italy, we're on the half-way line, ball played forward by Giorgio Gigno.
[3354.00 - 3361.00] P:1933.23 E:0.331206 |  Now it's near the edge of the box, Insigna turns in the D, Sterling comes in with a challenge, Insigna goes down in the D,
[3361.00 - 3367.00] P:1960.87 E:0.296746 |  and that is a free kick to Italy on the edge of the D of the England penalty area.
[3367.00 - 3375.00] P:1971.83 E:0.309118 |  And Insigna, there is contact from Sterling, Insigna gets his body in, he knows the foul's coming as well,
[3375.00 - 3384.00] P:1987.27 E:0.315516 |  knows what he's doing, such a clever player Insigna, but this is a real opportunity, clumsy from Sterling.
[3386.00 - 3394.00] P:1968.76 E:0.294744 |  Centrally, isn't it, the free kick, what, 22 yards out, just about the perfect distance.
[3395.00 - 3403.00] P:1931.28 E:0.311480 |  Right decision though, there was a foul, so Emerson's actually slamming again, set piece man to the right of the ball,
[3403.00 - 3410.00] P:1951.60 E:0.318333 |  but Insigna as well, and again as happened in the first half, Emerson does two big strides, but I think it's more likely to be Insigna, isn't it?
[3410.00 - 3417.00] P:2006.35 E:0.329633 |  Here comes Emerson, no stops, it is Insigna, curls in over the wall and just over the top right corner.
[3418.00 - 3431.00] P:1995.29 E:0.311629 |  The end, Insigna, once again, Emerson faints the shoot, that's a poor free kick in the end, three strides,
[3431.00 - 3439.00] P:1964.16 E:0.303246 |  tries to go Jordan Pickford side, Pickford, on that side of the goal, the ball goes a couple of yards wide,
[3439.00 - 3442.00] P:1926.47 E:0.302371 |  really disappointing effort from Lorenzo Insigna.
[3443.00 - 3452.00] P:2003.54 E:0.319375 |  So it's Italy nail England one, long ball from Pickford, that's expertly taken down by Harry Kane on his chest,
[3452.00 - 3459.00] P:1945.49 E:0.295369 |  gives it to Trippier as old teammate, that spurs, but Trippier, the ball bounces back onto him as Emerson comes in with the challenge
[3459.00 - 3467.00] P:1945.89 E:0.322912 |  and it's a throw into Italy, just taken back into the penalty area to Chiellini, Giorgio Chiellini, 37 next month,
[3467.00 - 3474.00] P:1996.19 E:0.334843 |  now out to Benucci, the whistles, that's given away by Lorenzo who passed it straight into Stirling,
[3474.00 - 3483.00] P:1917.94 E:0.304286 |  but it then start out of play off the Manchester City man and it's a throw into Italy, just a little further on than a level with their own penalty area.
[3483.00 - 3492.00] P:1961.37 E:0.327836 |  So England lead by one goal to Nill, it's like driving the ball forward, Calvin Phillips put in the challenge,
[3492.00 - 3498.00] P:1957.08 E:0.306049 |  the ace takes it on, Rice then gives it to Harry Kane, England have got mountain Stirling in the box,
[3498.00 - 3504.00] P:1969.71 E:0.317979 |  but England don't deliver it and it's taken away by the punched figure of Chiesa, who's over the half way line now,
[3504.00 - 3510.00] P:1923.86 E:0.309852 |  immobilised through the middle, Insigna is there as well, Chiesa, a long high ball right across the penalty area,
[3510.00 - 3519.00] P:1938.28 E:0.320334 |  but leaping high above Insigna, which admittedly isn't difficult to do, is Kyle Walker who heads it back to Pickford.
[3519.00 - 3527.00] P:1915.74 E:0.307980 |  Chiesa flying machine isn't he, Kyle Walker gets up brilliantly with a crossfield ball and composes as you like,
[3527.00 - 3532.00] P:1966.36 E:0.299850 |  Italy couple of subs stripped and ready to bring on.
[3532.00 - 3538.00] P:1949.12 E:0.326808 |  Well you thought Chris didn't, that Italy might have to change it, does Italy win it back, Chiellini challenge,
[3538.00 - 3545.00] P:1947.03 E:0.306506 |  win it back from Stirling, yep, double change for Italy coming up, immobilised, Calvin Phillips is all over him though,
[3545.00 - 3550.00] P:1931.42 E:0.331943 |  Italy are forced to go back towards the half way line, man pairing around there as well, he has Emerson now,
[3550.00 - 3557.00] P:1896.33 E:0.324182 |  Emerson now is able to take it on, he's got Insigna to his left, he uses Insigna, Insigna all right footed now,
[3557.00 - 3566.00] P:1946.67 E:0.325529 |  into the penalty area from the left, still going, curls it, oh hits it wildly wide and it bounced out of play closer to the corner flag than the goal.
[3566.00 - 3573.00] P:1974.60 E:0.313430 |  Yeah do you know what though, Insigna, here in Trippia, showed him the inside, he doesn't want to be doing that,
[3573.00 - 3580.00] P:1960.56 E:0.302917 |  that's into his strength on his right foot, don't want to give him too many ciders, tries to find that far corner,
[3580.00 - 3584.00] P:1933.33 E:0.289158 |  it was a wild effort, Trippia has to show him the line.
[3584.00 - 3592.00] P:1900.08 E:0.316469 |  This is Five Live and the World Service, we're also going out across many of England's BBC local radio stations as well,
[3592.00 - 3600.00] P:1876.91 E:0.311360 |  you can listen on BBC Sounds, Italy Mail, England One and you can also listen to the Five Live commentary with the BBC TV,
[3600.00 - 3609.00] P:1953.06 E:0.309578 |  and the pictures if you wish, if you've got an HD television, fire eye player, lovely shimmy from Rice in the centre circle.
[3609.00 - 3616.00] P:1984.50 E:0.320681 |  Now, allows Short to take it on and then the challenge comes in from him, the ball bounces out of play,
[3616.00 - 3621.00] P:1977.42 E:0.328065 |  it's going to England, Italian double change going to happen shortly,
[3621.00 - 3628.00] P:1807.97 E:0.321623 |  and the Christanti is certainly one of them who's coming on, a piercing whistle from referee Kipers,
[3628.00 - 3633.00] P:1998.31 E:0.347434 |  so we will see who's going to come off first.
[3633.00 - 3638.00] P:1921.12 E:0.319129 |  That is Varela who is trotting off, so he's on a yellow card,
[3638.00 - 3648.00] P:1890.38 E:0.339126 |  and the Interman is replaced by Brian Christanti of Roammat,
[3648.00 - 3658.00] P:1875.73 E:0.324417 |  and it is Immobilé who makes way, again failed to score in the knockout stages of this competition,
[3658.00 - 3666.00] P:1860.57 E:0.307769 |  and he is going to be replaced by Berardi, Domenico Berardi of Saswolo.
[3666.00 - 3671.00] P:1921.00 E:0.329970 |  It's a really interesting change that is Berardi.
[3671.00 - 3677.00] P:1913.04 E:0.332533 |  Challenge on there, this is Benucci, Benucci put the challenge in, the referee wants to have a word with him,
[3677.00 - 3685.00] P:1990.17 E:0.319109 |  the challenge on Raheem Sterling, yellow card's out, it's Benucci boot now, second Italian booking.
[3685.00 - 3692.00] P:1979.94 E:0.314594 |  Throw in Short to Sterling, Sterling has a little look behind, sees Benucci coming,
[3692.00 - 3699.00] P:1956.87 E:0.323991 |  Lix de Ball pass him, Benucci, Italian style, Lares-Jumbo pass, yellow card.
[3699.00 - 3707.00] P:1994.73 E:0.301151 |  Free kick then, free kick for England on the left hand side, set piece opportunity,
[3707.00 - 3712.00] P:1927.87 E:0.311574 |  haven't been too many of them in the match, only had three corners in the game so far,
[3712.00 - 3718.00] P:1914.81 E:0.312676 |  so England at this set piece that is going to be taken from out there on the left hand side,
[3718.00 - 3723.00] P:1958.98 E:0.311587 |  the referee's got a problem at the moment with his communications, so that is being fixed before
[3723.00 - 3728.00] P:1887.45 E:0.306544 |  Luke Shaw sends this in, Shaw standing there, short stand to his knees, long sleeves on,
[3728.00 - 3733.00] P:1908.50 E:0.300107 |  one foot in front of the other, standing, Alain, David Beckham the way he used to stand
[3733.00 - 3738.00] P:1988.39 E:0.326328 |  before taking three kicks, he's watching down from the stands on that side of the ground,
[3738.00 - 3744.00] P:2012.72 E:0.287368 |  Shaw takes the free kick towards Maguire who got up, but headed it over the top of the bar,
[3744.00 - 3748.00] P:1979.95 E:0.307609 |  I think he might have been leaning on the defender as well, it's a gold kick to Italy,
[3748.00 - 3754.00] P:1977.90 E:0.304260 |  and England continue to lead 1-0, so how have they reshuffled this Chris, Italy,
[3754.00 - 3759.00] P:1973.97 E:0.322966 |  well Insignia's through the middle, Insignia's through the middle,
[3759.00 - 3764.00] P:1950.05 E:0.291236 |  Gia is out, he's started on the right, out to the left hand side,
[3764.00 - 3771.00] P:1997.79 E:0.277342 |  and Berardi, a left footer, bit of a fiery character, he's gone to the right hand side,
[3771.00 - 3775.00] P:2011.81 E:0.305277 |  will come inside, he gets shots off with his left foot, here's Gia, he's on the left now though,
[3775.00 - 3779.00] P:2000.30 E:0.295768 |  into the penalty area, drives a left footer ball across the box, Insignia's still going,
[3779.00 - 3784.00] P:1989.34 E:0.287788 |  shoots from the angle, it's pushed away by Pickford, two defenders went with Insignia there,
[3784.00 - 3788.00] P:1961.98 E:0.305137 |  and Pickford was able to make the save, a kind of clawing save in the opposed,
[3788.00 - 3793.00] P:1977.39 E:0.306416 |  I'm not sure actually whether it was on target, it might have just been flashing across the six yard box,
[3793.00 - 3799.00] P:1994.08 E:0.323032 |  but he pushed it away anyway, the England goalkeeper, still England 1-0, but Italy in possession,
[3799.00 - 3805.00] P:1966.58 E:0.318911 |  having made the changes, we'll have to see if that's going to revitalise Roberto Mancini's team,
[3805.00 - 3815.00] P:1956.84 E:0.296654 |  Italy with Berardi as they play towards our left, here's Giorginho, Giorginho looking for Berardi,
[3815.00 - 3822.00] P:1945.22 E:0.335856 |  in fact it's Di Lorenzo who takes it up, and then, the ball just runs away, Di Lorenzo,
[3822.00 - 3826.00] P:1972.15 E:0.310247 |  and it's gone out of play in the other corner, flag for a throw into England.
[3826.00 - 3833.00] P:1999.51 E:0.321799 |  Just seeing this chance for Insignia, there's Chiesa who shoots from the left hand side of the box,
[3833.00 - 3838.00] P:2015.87 E:0.322887 |  it takes a deflection off Trippia, and Insignia, the ball lands at his feet,
[3838.00 - 3843.00] P:1951.57 E:0.311562 |  a couple of quick touches with his right foot, the angle against him, fires a shot,
[3843.00 - 3848.00] P:1924.87 E:0.314547 |  it may have just been heading into the far corner, but Pickford with a smart save.
[3848.00 - 3852.00] P:1767.25 E:0.320311 |  Italy having a good spell here now, England leading through the Luke Shaw goal,
[3852.00 - 3857.00] P:1929.19 E:0.321512 |  this is the Euro 2020 final, here in July 2021,
[3857.00 - 3865.00] P:1963.40 E:0.333438 |  Italy with Verratti, Giorginho, Giorginho turns and just touches it back into the centre circle.
[3865.00 - 3877.00] P:1952.42 E:0.337458 |  And so Benucci finds Chiellini, Chiellini, then to Insignia, England have led since one minute and 57 seconds into the final.
[3877.00 - 3884.00] P:1984.68 E:0.342703 |  That's a poor ball from Centreli, from Giorginho, Italy did well actually to keep it in play,
[3884.00 - 3889.00] P:1964.30 E:0.311850 |  and then eventually it bobbles out of play on the far side for a throw into England,
[3889.00 - 3891.00] P:1911.64 E:0.307341 |  level with the edge of their own penalty area.
[3891.00 - 3901.00] P:1996.43 E:0.322594 |  Yeah, you can see Roberto Mangini cuts a frustrated figure in that Italian technical area.
[3901.00 - 3905.00] P:1999.18 E:0.333112 |  You can see the idea, they're going to try and play through England,
[3905.00 - 3911.00] P:2005.09 E:0.329827 |  Spill got the option on the bench of Bellotti, he's more of an old-fashioned number nine,
[3911.00 - 3915.00] P:1936.87 E:0.314461 |  someone you can cross the ball into, but with Insignia centre forward,
[3915.00 - 3921.00] P:1948.13 E:0.315243 |  showing his hand, they try and play through the England backbind.
[3921.00 - 3927.00] P:1929.81 E:0.328244 |  England can't get out at the moment, Italy pressing them back into their defensive third,
[3927.00 - 3932.00] P:1949.58 E:0.314490 |  despite the odd Italian error, Italy come forward again.
[3932.00 - 3939.00] P:1934.28 E:0.336606 |  Italy, who have not won the European Championship themselves since 1968,
[3939.00 - 3942.00] P:1913.58 E:0.337108 |  despite all of their great achievements in the World Cup since then,
[3942.00 - 3948.00] P:1954.70 E:0.329865 |  this is their tenth final in either the World Cup or European Championship.
[3948.00 - 3951.00] P:1937.95 E:0.322058 |  As you will know, only England's second, here's Verratti,
[3951.00 - 3954.00] P:1808.16 E:0.307408 |  Loboldo Insignia on the edge of the box comes back,
[3954.00 - 3959.00] P:1920.02 E:0.314976 |  Giorgio Gigno thought about having a goal, gives it to Lorenzo on the right,
[3959.00 - 3962.00] P:1916.99 E:0.319985 |  Lorenzo lifts the ball across the penalty area,
[3962.00 - 3965.00] P:1933.00 E:0.328293 |  it's chested down on the edge of the box and the referee is spotted.
[3965.00 - 3969.00] P:1978.27 E:0.320760 |  I think a hand ball in there by Chiesa and it's a great kick through England.
[3969.00 - 3976.00] P:1956.09 E:0.326322 |  He gets to his feet, he puts his hands in a sort of playing motion in front of his chest,
[3976.00 - 3978.00] P:1972.93 E:0.317793 |  he looks aghast.
[3979.00 - 3984.00] P:1996.70 E:0.325349 |  The ball, the ball takes it on his chest and then it does hit his left arm,
[3984.00 - 3989.00] P:2003.96 E:0.317009 |  I don't know why he's complaining about, the ball stood up from the wide area.
[3989.00 - 3997.00] P:2016.34 E:0.317179 |  You think that Gareth in England would be quite happy with Big High crosses coming into the box
[3997.00 - 4003.00] P:1929.29 E:0.306246 |  with Insignia as the central striker and no great height in the wide areas?
[4003.00 - 4005.00] P:1910.83 E:0.312440 |  You would have thought so wouldn't you?
[4006.00 - 4012.00] P:1955.17 E:0.273017 |  1-0 to England, we've got half an hour to go,
[4012.00 - 4017.00] P:1999.79 E:0.335545 |  but only one goal in it, Phillips to Rice, Rice now takes it on through the middle,
[4017.00 - 4022.00] P:1970.83 E:0.305534 |  still going but the pass through to Stirling was over hit and it just runs away through
[4022.00 - 4026.00] P:1992.73 E:0.308107 |  the Donnarumma to move to his right and pick it up.
[4026.00 - 4034.00] P:1979.97 E:0.326804 |  That ball looks like a little marble in Donnarumma's hands as it's played back to the edge of the box
[4034.00 - 4042.00] P:1963.65 E:0.341289 |  and Di Lorenzo at the right hand side to the newly arrived Christante who finds Rice arriving,
[4042.00 - 4045.00] P:1910.93 E:0.329435 |  putting in the challenge to put it out of play.
[4045.00 - 4048.00] P:1902.87 E:0.301448 |  He has covered some ground in this match, Declan Rice.
[4049.00 - 4056.00] P:1981.01 E:0.333630 |  He's covered some ground in that whole tournament, outstanding for England.
[4057.00 - 4061.00] P:1823.96 E:0.322505 |  He started more matches than anyone else in this epic season for England,
[4061.00 - 4066.00] P:1862.48 E:0.310571 |  well every international team but particularly these two, this is England's 20th match of the season.
[4066.00 - 4070.00] P:1930.68 E:0.315173 |  Italy down the right hand side, the ball clicked forward but Pickford is coming
[4070.00 - 4076.00] P:1958.19 E:0.319198 |  and Pickford dummies as if to clear it, then takes a touch and then whacks it away downfield,
[4076.00 - 4078.00] P:1928.23 E:0.298082 |  Benucci's underneath that.
[4078.00 - 4081.00] P:1943.53 E:0.300610 |  Italy nail England 1 if you've just joined us.
[4082.00 - 4086.00] P:1943.01 E:0.323642 |  Italy coming for it again, he has Chiesa turns meaningfully into the penalty area now,
[4086.00 - 4089.00] P:1958.94 E:0.307787 |  he's on his right foot, this could be trouble, right foot shot,
[4089.00 - 4096.00] P:2020.31 E:0.297070 |  Pickford gets down and needs the save, full length this time, Chiesa the danger man,
[4096.00 - 4098.00] P:2018.14 E:0.300346 |  saved by Pickford.
[4098.00 - 4101.00] P:1974.74 E:0.324119 |  Off the left hand side driving in on his favourite right foot,
[4101.00 - 4108.00] P:2011.84 E:0.321861 |  maneuvered the ball brilliantly, a shift, another shift and then he fires the ball towards the far corner,
[4108.00 - 4112.00] P:1978.70 E:0.291570 |  it looks like it's creeping in but Pickford gets down, great save.
[4112.00 - 4116.00] P:1944.66 E:0.315896 |  Ball into the England penalty area again but this one's comfortable for Pickford,
[4116.00 - 4120.00] P:1972.87 E:0.306753 |  who's able to move across and just control it, trap it with his left foot.
[4120.00 - 4126.00] P:1824.37 E:0.311323 |  But certainly Chiesa, he's the man for the big occasion, that's how they know him in Italy
[4126.00 - 4131.00] P:1971.32 E:0.294101 |  and he's already scored here in two of the matches that Italy have played,
[4131.00 - 4136.00] P:1881.17 E:0.291345 |  that struggle against Austria and of course the goal against Spain on Tuesday night,
[4136.00 - 4141.00] P:1913.75 E:0.298094 |  he was very nearly in there for another one but Pickford to the rescue, brilliant save.
[4142.00 - 4149.00] P:2013.70 E:0.334696 |  Down, two is left to Pickford but England just inviting, too much pressure in this second half.
[4149.00 - 4153.00] P:2007.16 E:0.335857 |  However that will relieve the pressure as the ball has played downfield,
[4153.00 - 4158.00] P:1955.44 E:0.323413 |  Mount running shoulder to shoulder with Diorenzo and he headed it behind them, it's a corner to England.
[4159.00 - 4164.00] P:2015.73 E:0.331428 |  Good run from Mason Mount, they're trying to stretch that Italian back line
[4164.00 - 4170.00] P:2028.98 E:0.322284 |  and ageing Italian back line, this gives England a bit of respite now.
[4172.00 - 4178.00] P:1965.17 E:0.318514 |  Well Roberto Mancini has made his two changes, England, Garas Southgate,
[4178.00 - 4181.00] P:1923.29 E:0.303941 |  I don't see Steve Holland over there, they'll brainstorm for England,
[4181.00 - 4188.00] P:1930.47 E:0.299506 |  Garas Southgate in the buttoned up Mac on the edge of the coaching area, just shifting from foot to foot.
[4188.00 - 4193.00] P:1900.14 E:0.287407 |  England end with a corner, four men in a group near the penalty spot, sterling further forward.
[4193.00 - 4197.00] P:2024.78 E:0.307323 |  He has the delivery, Stoams with a head up but it's over the top,
[4197.00 - 4200.00] P:1976.35 E:0.257353 |  however Donnarumma got his fingertips to that, I'm fairly sure,
[4200.00 - 4204.00] P:1936.78 E:0.284287 |  even though it might have been going over and it's a second consecutive corner.
[4205.00 - 4215.00] P:2009.37 E:0.299890 |  All whipped in from Trippie, off John Stone's shoulder, Donnarumma gets a big finger to it and tips it over,
[4215.00 - 4218.00] P:2030.59 E:0.315340 |  Stones will be disappointed, he hasn't scored.
[4219.00 - 4224.00] P:2032.83 E:0.320228 |  Another corner from the left, Trippie with the delivery to the near post this time
[4224.00 - 4229.00] P:1935.29 E:0.287152 |  and this is Bonucci who's underneath it to head it away to Luxio near the halfway line.
[4229.00 - 4234.00] P:1928.89 E:0.274895 |  But that I think, I think that's England's first attempt on goal in the second half,
[4235.00 - 4237.00] P:1847.92 E:0.306023 |  but they lead by one goal to nil.
[4238.00 - 4246.00] P:1986.62 E:0.310414 |  It was tense, I believe, so I've heard the stories over the years, back in 1966 in the final,
[4246.00 - 4252.00] P:1960.29 E:0.294925 |  against the Germans when they equalised right at the end of normal time.
[4253.00 - 4260.00] P:1913.69 E:0.309167 |  And there's just something about this Chris which makes me feel that we may yet have drama, what do you think?
[4260.00 - 4266.00] P:1958.40 E:0.321465 |  Yeah, and no doubt England, if that's a weather, a bit of an Italian storm at the start of this second half,
[4266.00 - 4269.00] P:1936.72 E:0.316233 |  he expected the Italians to show more.
[4269.00 - 4274.00] P:1915.82 E:0.302250 |  Ball played for England but Donnarumma is there, feet wide apart as the ball bounces open,
[4274.00 - 4277.00] P:1908.76 E:0.309907 |  he touches it in front of his face with Mount arriving.
[4277.00 - 4282.00] P:1994.91 E:0.326139 |  A lot was made of how England saw the game out against Denmark the last couple of minutes,
[4282.00 - 4286.00] P:1972.75 E:0.335224 |  I need to show that composer again here in the second half,
[4286.00 - 4289.00] P:1993.30 E:0.310489 |  it's Italy who are really dominating the ball.
[4289.00 - 4294.00] P:1991.83 E:0.293424 |  Italy on this 33-match unbeaten run,
[4295.00 - 4300.00] P:1957.96 E:0.316939 |  they don't know what the feeling of defeat is like wearing the Asuri shirt anymore.
[4301.00 - 4305.00] P:1983.05 E:0.281681 |  Here's Berati, Berati with the ball forward,
[4305.00 - 4309.00] P:1920.41 E:0.298739 |  he's senior, back towards Dela Renzo.
[4309.00 - 4316.00] P:1961.81 E:0.281297 |  Now Berati on the right hand side, Berati running at shore but Berati has to check back
[4316.00 - 4320.00] P:1912.42 E:0.290574 |  and give it to the other substitute, Cristanti, Brian Cristanti,
[4320.00 - 4324.00] P:1818.18 E:0.320842 |  can't be too many Italians who are christened, Brian you wouldn't have thought.
[4324.00 - 4328.00] P:1872.70 E:0.314442 |  Here's Insignia, now to the right hand side to Dela Renzo,
[4328.00 - 4334.00] P:1908.90 E:0.310458 |  now forward of the centre circle, Giorgio Gigno and the Italians are just knocking the ball around inside the England half,
[4334.00 - 4340.00] P:1968.53 E:0.332149 |  England sitting right off them, Berati, Shaven headed, right for the ball,
[4340.00 - 4346.00] P:1994.37 E:0.320550 |  works it to Kiers on the left hand side, even Kielini's up there, Kierser plays it into the back post
[4346.00 - 4350.00] P:2002.16 E:0.301424 |  and the final touches off an England head in there,
[4350.00 - 4355.00] P:1955.43 E:0.306625 |  and an important one as well from Harry Maguire to take it beyond the far post for a corner.
[4355.00 - 4362.00] P:1985.11 E:0.315061 |  This is crucial from Maguire as the ball shifted from Kierser onto his favourite right foot
[4362.00 - 4369.00] P:1975.02 E:0.291903 |  and Cristanti's in behind him and Maguire heads the ball over his own bar to safety.
[4370.00 - 4373.00] P:1818.77 E:0.337200 |  These are tense moments now, England with the slender 1-0 lead,
[4373.00 - 4377.00] P:1905.67 E:0.305746 |  but Italy with a corner from the right which is delivered into the near post,
[4377.00 - 4381.00] P:1947.21 E:0.298077 |  glanced across the face of goal, there's an Italian gone down and the ball is buried in the net.
[4382.00 - 4388.00] P:1973.48 E:0.324676 |  Italy have equalised and it's Benucci who was there in the six yard box,
[4388.00 - 4396.00] P:1918.33 E:0.303520 |  the veteran central defender forced it over the line and rattled around in the six yard box
[4396.00 - 4399.00] P:1800.23 E:0.304509 |  and we're back all square in the final.
[4401.00 - 4403.00] P:1851.52 E:0.331923 |  Italy won, England won.
[4403.00 - 4409.00] P:1783.79 E:0.333421 |  You've got to say you felt it was coming, the Italian lands behind the goal, go wild.
[4412.00 - 4416.00] P:1836.38 E:0.355012 |  Benucci with the tap in, it's sort of set-piece, England don't clear the line,
[4416.00 - 4419.00] P:1786.37 E:0.324046 |  I think Pickford makes a great save somewhere in there.
[4420.00 - 4425.00] P:1993.64 E:0.336001 |  Italy win the first header, debatable with that, Kierlin is asking for a foul from John Stones,
[4425.00 - 4431.00] P:2005.10 E:0.310165 |  but he's going to tap it in and then I think it's the ratty with the header,
[4431.00 - 4436.00] P:1933.92 E:0.300273 |  Pickford it's a brilliant save, the ball crashes off the post and there's Benucci,
[4436.00 - 4442.00] P:1955.75 E:0.301245 |  a yard out, pops it in, easy as finish, he'll have it in his career
[4442.00 - 4445.00] P:1995.63 E:0.299116 |  and he celebrates wildly, Italy all square.
[4447.00 - 4452.00] P:1871.79 E:0.319392 |  England concede for the second time in the tournament and that means it's all square
[4453.00 - 4456.00] P:1992.56 E:0.333517 |  and we've got a quarter of the match to go.
[4457.00 - 4465.00] P:1910.47 E:0.345459 |  And Benucci absolutely loved that, his eighth goal for Italy,
[4465.00 - 4470.00] P:1960.49 E:0.316048 |  he leapt up onto the hoarding as in front of all of those thousands of Italian fans
[4470.00 - 4473.00] P:1868.08 E:0.319347 |  in the end to our left and celebrate a wildly.
[4473.00 - 4476.00] P:1987.84 E:0.302474 |  Let's go down pitch side to Karin Karnik.
[4476.00 - 4479.00] P:2000.48 E:0.313604 |  Ah look, the whole stadium's rocked, I'm looking at the stand behind me,
[4479.00 - 4483.00] P:1959.48 E:0.318746 |  everyone is silent, it's like I've seen a ghost, there's no reaction,
[4483.00 - 4487.00] P:1997.69 E:0.301841 |  you need to get behind the gliser game, the pressure was coming,
[4487.00 - 4490.00] P:1933.86 E:0.297084 |  I'm taking the ball on up towards the edge of the penalty area,
[4490.00 - 4495.00] P:1967.01 E:0.290311 |  Insignia is there as well, one-one the score now, Kiezer dips his shoulder,
[4495.00 - 4498.00] P:1993.72 E:0.280190 |  takes the ball out towards the right hand side,
[4498.00 - 4502.00] P:1953.59 E:0.286510 |  Italy are going for it now, having rocked England back with that equaliser,
[4502.00 - 4505.00] P:1972.87 E:0.285156 |  still Kiezer on the right, drives it right across the penalty area
[4505.00 - 4509.00] P:1912.09 E:0.316969 |  and out of play for a throw in in the England right back area,
[4509.00 - 4513.00] P:1851.34 E:0.310534 |  so Chris Sutton, what does the England approach need to be?
[4513.00 - 4516.00] P:1732.00 E:0.303220 |  I see that Steve Hollande is over there with Garrett Southgate,
[4516.00 - 4520.00] P:1916.38 E:0.318141 |  the double change that Roberto Mancini made, that revitalised Italy.
[4520.00 - 4525.00] P:2017.67 E:0.338801 |  Absolutely, the substitutions is made throughout the tournament,
[4525.00 - 4530.00] P:1989.48 E:0.318229 |  Mancini has always had a reaction, his Italian team,
[4530.00 - 4533.00] P:2006.37 E:0.322098 |  they deserve the equaliser, you have to say that,
[4533.00 - 4538.00] P:1968.92 E:0.316635 |  in England they've rattled their shelf-shop, they need to get the composure back,
[4538.00 - 4542.00] P:1962.11 E:0.331774 |  trying to control the ball-keep possession for a period,
[4542.00 - 4545.00] P:1991.63 E:0.319572 |  it's all Italy though.
[4545.00 - 4551.00] P:1866.77 E:0.316960 |  Yes it is, and it was a terrific save by Jordan Pickford in the midst of all that,
[4551.00 - 4556.00] P:1869.44 E:0.302836 |  it might easily have actually been a foul by stones on Chiellini in the six-yard box,
[4556.00 - 4560.00] P:1903.08 E:0.306677 |  but Gratti, he didn't know that, Pickford made the save onto the post,
[4560.00 - 4564.00] P:1911.33 E:0.293952 |  but it bounced perfectly for Bernucci just a couple of yards out
[4564.00 - 4568.00] P:2012.64 E:0.321198 |  to fire it into the back of the net, scruffy goal,
[4568.00 - 4572.00] P:1983.81 E:0.298808 |  but Italy will take that, and it's 1-1,
[4572.00 - 4576.00] P:1922.98 E:0.323913 |  and it feels like the momentum is with Roberto Mancini's side,
[4576.00 - 4580.00] P:1990.56 E:0.327249 |  Italy now down the left-hand side for Emerson,
[4580.00 - 4584.00] P:1990.60 E:0.327080 |  here is Gratti, but Walker is able to come across and block it out of play for Throats,
[4584.00 - 4588.00] P:1918.42 E:0.321354 |  the Italian fans you can hear over on that behind Jordan Pickford's goal.
[4588.00 - 4590.00] P:1984.53 E:0.304002 |  Here goes Saka John,
[4590.00 - 4595.00] P:1954.79 E:0.312275 |  so it's Pukayo Saka, and that is Kieran Trippia who is coming off.
[4595.00 - 4598.00] P:2004.97 E:0.321334 |  Well England can't get up the pitch,
[4598.00 - 4604.00] P:2001.55 E:0.334948 |  they need a ball carrier, maybe Saka is the man to do that.
[4608.00 - 4614.00] P:1935.04 E:0.326996 |  So Kieran Trippia is replaced by Pukayo Saka,
[4615.00 - 4620.00] P:1950.03 E:0.341273 |  and this 19-year-old Londoner from just down the road in Ealing,
[4620.00 - 4622.00] P:1902.02 E:0.335505 |  originally where he was born,
[4622.00 - 4627.00] P:1900.36 E:0.277409 |  on he comes to take his place in this England line-up,
[4627.00 - 4629.00] P:1807.62 E:0.322013 |  in the final here at Wembley Stadium,
[4629.00 - 4636.00] P:1983.30 E:0.332244 |  and see if he can do for England what Mancini's two substitutes did for Italy.
[4636.00 - 4640.00] P:1998.44 E:0.343887 |  Kieran raised the England tempo, Kaine on the halfway line is blocked,
[4640.00 - 4642.00] P:2007.73 E:0.317027 |  the referee's not having that either,
[4642.00 - 4646.00] P:1947.01 E:0.300866 |  the challenge from Giorgio Gigno, Harry Kaine gets to his feet,
[4646.00 - 4649.00] P:1911.46 E:0.317555 |  having been very much involved in the game in the first half,
[4649.00 - 4652.00] P:1915.74 E:0.298909 |  Kaine sterling, they can't really get into it in the second,
[4652.00 - 4654.00] P:1908.81 E:0.307643 |  because Italy are dominating.
[4654.00 - 4658.00] P:1907.08 E:0.304213 |  England, change of formation,
[4658.00 - 4661.00] P:2012.32 E:0.326393 |  this is, you know,
[4661.00 - 4664.00] P:1999.24 E:0.318374 |  any thought that Gareth would start the game,
[4664.00 - 4666.00] P:2013.47 E:0.298671 |  that back four now.
[4666.00 - 4669.00] P:1985.27 E:0.323436 |  Well, this is the team that started against Denmark,
[4669.00 - 4671.00] P:1952.47 E:0.316052 |  with Saka coming on for Trippia.
[4671.00 - 4676.00] P:1950.53 E:0.310185 |  So Gareth Southgate looking to recapture a bit of the spirit,
[4676.00 - 4679.00] P:1888.29 E:0.322885 |  and the play that we saw against Denmark,
[4679.00 - 4682.00] P:1902.24 E:0.341257 |  when England over the piece with a better team.
[4682.00 - 4684.00] P:1772.98 E:0.336636 |  Yeah, in Cinges a massive problem,
[4684.00 - 4687.00] P:1957.33 E:0.337908 |  for England is playing in that central role now,
[4687.00 - 4691.00] P:1983.87 E:0.312528 |  coming deep, turns so sharply,
[4691.00 - 4695.00] P:2013.54 E:0.307419 |  fuzzing around, linking the play-up,
[4695.00 - 4699.00] P:2020.91 E:0.330832 |  and England need to come up with something.
[4699.00 - 4703.00] P:1991.83 E:0.290631 |  Try and just have five minutes keeping possession,
[4703.00 - 4705.00] P:1987.13 E:0.334802 |  the Italians with the momentum.
[4705.00 - 4708.00] P:2004.00 E:0.304482 |  Lines are open for 6-0-6, by the way,
[4708.00 - 4711.00] P:1958.57 E:0.318866 |  Chris Sutton will be with Alistair Bruce-Ball and Terry Butcher,
[4711.00 - 4714.00] P:1938.91 E:0.314922 |  08, 08, 05, 09, 06, 09, 03 to have your say.
[4714.00 - 4716.00] P:2001.37 E:0.331940 |  Harry Kaine turns,
[4716.00 - 4718.00] P:2021.97 E:0.316119 |  tries to get the pass to Saka,
[4718.00 - 4723.00] P:2012.39 E:0.320960 |  but Emerson was able to get there first for Italy.
[4724.00 - 4728.00] P:1914.23 E:0.324902 |  And the Italians have it again in front of their own penalty area.
[4728.00 - 4731.00] P:1957.17 E:0.317245 |  Wembley's been good for the Italians and for Mancini,
[4731.00 - 4735.00] P:1959.35 E:0.307970 |  he's an FA Cup winner here with Manchester City, remember?
[4735.00 - 4739.00] P:1998.05 E:0.334825 |  In this tournament, came through against the Austrians,
[4739.00 - 4742.00] P:1943.15 E:0.337561 |  came through in the penalty shootout against Spain,
[4742.00 - 4744.00] P:2003.69 E:0.314067 |  and now they've come from behind,
[4744.00 - 4748.00] P:1972.72 E:0.323850 |  against Post-Nation England,
[4748.00 - 4751.00] P:1971.31 E:0.325698 |  in senior, on the left, incomes, walk-over the challenge,
[4751.00 - 4753.00] P:2010.13 E:0.327192 |  that fan's inside of play,
[4753.00 - 4756.00] P:1947.12 E:0.315804 |  going to Italy 10 yards inside the England half.
[4756.00 - 4759.00] P:1867.02 E:0.307765 |  Difficult period of the match, this McGarris Southgate's team.
[4759.00 - 4764.00] P:1886.90 E:0.295657 |  Remember in the last Euro's, France lost as the host in the final to Portugal.
[4765.00 - 4768.00] P:1969.83 E:0.310957 |  Karate takes the throw back to goal scorer Benucci,
[4768.00 - 4770.00] P:1994.83 E:0.319948 |  and Benucci's ball over the top,
[4770.00 - 4774.00] P:1983.14 E:0.303348 |  Pickford's up third, it's driven goalwards by the arriving Barardi,
[4774.00 - 4778.00] P:1912.86 E:0.286591 |  and England were fortunate there that his volley took it over the top.
[4779.00 - 4782.00] P:1870.26 E:0.329933 |  What a ball, what a run from Barardi,
[4782.00 - 4786.00] P:1914.62 E:0.280967 |  Benucci, inch perfect, and I think Pickford just does enough
[4786.00 - 4790.00] P:2014.09 E:0.317634 |  as the ball coming over Barardi's left shoulder on the volley,
[4790.00 - 4794.00] P:2030.45 E:0.325791 |  Pickford out, I think Barardi sees him at the corner of his eye,
[4794.00 - 4797.00] P:2027.98 E:0.331361 |  and there's like a scissor kick motion,
[4797.00 - 4800.00] P:2029.57 E:0.344825 |  those three or four yards over the England bar,
[4800.00 - 4802.00] P:2059.82 E:0.281788 |  but England have to watch that.
[4802.00 - 4806.00] P:2041.52 E:0.322878 |  That would have been a fabulous goal if he had scored.
[4807.00 - 4811.00] P:1861.09 E:0.358712 |  England breathes out relief though, that he didn't,
[4811.00 - 4816.00] P:1886.82 E:0.341750 |  and now, Garret Southgate has decided it's time for the experience
[4816.00 - 4818.00] P:1940.88 E:0.338194 |  of the Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson,
[4818.00 - 4821.00] P:1969.36 E:0.303436 |  and he takes the place of Declan Rice in midfield.
[4821.00 - 4826.00] P:1873.51 E:0.280910 |  Jordan Henderson coming on for England for what is left of this final.
[4828.00 - 4832.00] P:1990.14 E:0.311991 |  This is just a case jump, simply a fresh leg, fresh impetus.
[4833.00 - 4837.00] P:2005.61 E:0.305252 |  1-1, Calvin Phillips in on the challenge, but Italy have it back again.
[4837.00 - 4840.00] P:1945.94 E:0.320298 |  We're heading for extra time, there's things down,
[4840.00 - 4843.00] P:1968.90 E:0.324249 |  Kiezer playing it through the middle, now he has insignia,
[4843.00 - 4845.00] P:1979.65 E:0.303114 |  turns, gives it back on the edge of the box,
[4845.00 - 4850.00] P:2030.89 E:0.319365 |  Pickford is able to step forward as he bounced away from Christante,
[4850.00 - 4854.00] P:1926.98 E:0.316197 |  and the England goalkeeper was able to snatch it up from the grass.
[4854.00 - 4857.00] P:1970.25 E:0.308518 |  Once again insignia, the Italian Messi.
[4858.00 - 4862.00] P:1951.85 E:0.331637 |  He was called earlier on in this tournament, on the half-turn,
[4862.00 - 4866.00] P:1965.36 E:0.333746 |  little ball into Christante, who makes a driving run forward,
[4866.00 - 4870.00] P:1997.82 E:0.312743 |  and a heavy touch from Christante in Pickford gathers.
[4870.00 - 4874.00] P:1966.80 E:0.315512 |  Italy come again, England can't get out, insignia,
[4874.00 - 4877.00] P:1923.11 E:0.320117 |  turning, giving it to the left hand side, Kiezer is there, he's got space,
[4877.00 - 4881.00] P:1984.40 E:0.311670 |  into the penalty, he goes, the man across comes Walker,
[4881.00 - 4884.00] P:2002.91 E:0.303796 |  and is able to pass it forward towards Buccio Sacca,
[4884.00 - 4888.00] P:1977.53 E:0.333899 |  and the ball bounces up and strikes, Kuccio Sacca's hand.
[4888.00 - 4892.00] P:1958.96 E:0.341016 |  It's just this feeling at the moment that the things are going against England,
[4892.00 - 4896.00] P:1961.30 E:0.325209 |  every little 50-50 is going Italy's way.
[4896.00 - 4902.00] P:1977.02 E:0.331592 |  You say that, but England are playing with fear at this moment in time,
[4902.00 - 4908.00] P:2018.17 E:0.333387 |  as Italy, with the confidence, they defensively, they're a back four,
[4908.00 - 4912.00] P:2020.95 E:0.324844 |  but when they're on the ball, it's a three,
[4912.00 - 4915.00] P:2006.40 E:0.349184 |  and the pile players forward.
[4918.00 - 4924.00] P:2016.42 E:0.331772 |  Italy continue to have possession in the middle of the field.
[4924.00 - 4927.00] P:1973.61 E:0.318461 |  The England crowd is trying to do its bit, Kiezer plays it through,
[4927.00 - 4931.00] P:1953.47 E:0.316072 |  but Maguire steps forward, and is able to bring it forward,
[4931.00 - 4934.00] P:2008.75 E:0.350179 |  but just clears it out of play on the half-way line.
[4934.00 - 4939.00] P:2009.21 E:0.339973 |  Maguire, in his own half-way, just pumps the ball into the crowd,
[4939.00 - 4944.00] P:1948.15 E:0.290181 |  the England players ahead of him just aren't showing for the ball,
[4944.00 - 4948.00] P:1959.39 E:0.307508 |  and at the moment you have to say, John, they're looking like lambs for the slaughter.
[4948.00 - 4954.00] P:2012.93 E:0.292339 |  It's wave after wave of Italian attacks.
[4954.00 - 4957.00] P:1937.84 E:0.319330 |  This is going badly wrong for England at the moment,
[4957.00 - 4964.00] P:1958.35 E:0.304817 |  even though the score is only one-one, Kiezer looks as though he's just got out of the bath
[4964.00 - 4967.00] P:1901.93 E:0.303369 |  and walked under the field, he looks as fresh as a daisy.
[4967.00 - 4972.00] P:1903.54 E:0.313175 |  Italy playing the ball back to Paratti, Paratti here he is, Kiezer again,
[4972.00 - 4976.00] P:1768.07 E:0.309213 |  Phillips trying to reach him in senior as well, he's a little buddler of energy,
[4976.00 - 4979.00] P:1889.06 E:0.306487 |  and then Italy play it back towards the centre-circle again.
[4979.00 - 4983.00] P:1920.91 E:0.340593 |  Absolutely no question, Rilardo Mancini's team are on top here,
[4983.00 - 4988.00] P:1996.82 E:0.332978 |  whistles from the supporters, but England just needs something.
[4988.00 - 4991.00] P:1963.91 E:0.326423 |  Jordan Henderson is there trying to bring that energy
[4991.00 - 4995.00] P:1936.82 E:0.322643 |  and trying to bring a bit of his leadership to the affair,
[4995.00 - 4998.00] P:1808.38 E:0.299050 |  but Italy dominating the possession now.
[4998.00 - 5005.00] P:1908.54 E:0.310246 |  Less than 15 minutes to go, and it feels like England are clinging on.
[5005.00 - 5010.00] P:1923.23 E:0.307241 |  Chiellini works the ball to Emerson, then back in field.
[5010.00 - 5015.00] P:1881.67 E:0.319680 |  The question is whether Italy are going to be able to be ruthless enough to finish England off,
[5015.00 - 5018.00] P:1905.46 E:0.302252 |  one-one the score.
[5018.00 - 5022.00] P:1942.09 E:0.329429 |  They're working so hard out of possession England, the Italians are stretching them,
[5022.00 - 5024.00] P:1978.64 E:0.321462 |  they're moving them around.
[5024.00 - 5028.00] P:1970.02 E:0.316704 |  Phillips is able to step in, Harry Kane had his shirt pulled there,
[5028.00 - 5032.00] P:1976.32 E:0.310809 |  Henderson stabs it forward, Chiellini forward from him, ahead of Sucker.
[5032.00 - 5036.00] P:1974.07 E:0.312844 |  Maguire now, centre-field Maguire goes down, the referee gives the free-kick
[5036.00 - 5042.00] P:1993.58 E:0.327267 |  England's way as it was being carried forward by Kiezer, the free-kick England.
[5042.00 - 5047.00] P:1992.10 E:0.307465 |  They're swarming all over England, high pressure.
[5047.00 - 5052.00] P:1921.41 E:0.319522 |  Giorginho needs the lead up, the presser was a foul on Maguire,
[5052.00 - 5057.00] P:1966.55 E:0.301714 |  he just wonder, can England, can they counter against this Italian team?
[5057.00 - 5061.00] P:1949.96 E:0.294132 |  Mason Mount with a touch over there, he's barely been involved.
[5061.00 - 5065.00] P:1962.50 E:0.320837 |  Mason Mount in the second half, nothing of sterling either,
[5065.00 - 5069.00] P:1892.55 E:0.337626 |  as Maguire brings it forward, he was fouled again, another little foul,
[5069.00 - 5074.00] P:1938.99 E:0.316328 |  this one by Giorginho, free-kick to England.
[5074.00 - 5079.00] P:1974.12 E:0.318673 |  Maguire looked to the referee with a sort of resigned look,
[5079.00 - 5082.00] P:1945.48 E:0.321329 |  free-kick, it's taken short, Calvin Phillips has it,
[5082.00 - 5086.00] P:1929.41 E:0.324547 |  Walker on the halfway line now, Sucker receives it just down in front of us
[5086.00 - 5091.00] P:1821.83 E:0.335879 |  on the right-hand side, Sucker now, Hing comes forward, and it takes his legs,
[5091.00 - 5096.00] P:1912.58 E:0.323790 |  takes the legs of Sucker, he can't get away with that, Barati.
[5096.00 - 5100.00] P:1949.17 E:0.327186 |  Well, I think he is going to get away with it, free-kick to England,
[5100.00 - 5102.00] P:1950.53 E:0.294134 |  and that's all.
[5102.00 - 5107.00] P:1915.67 E:0.303336 |  You think from Garry Sousgate's point of view, you get Sucker on the ball,
[5107.00 - 5112.00] P:1958.55 E:0.312135 |  1v1 situations against Emerson, test him out.
[5114.00 - 5118.00] P:1935.68 E:0.318519 |  Chris, do you have a feeling here that maybe England's best chance in this match
[5118.00 - 5123.00] P:1953.15 E:0.305381 |  might have gone in the first half when they were on top?
[5123.00 - 5128.00] P:1927.95 E:0.295444 |  If you say that, this Italian team, they're a great Italian team.
[5128.00 - 5131.00] P:1931.89 E:0.317835 |  You want to win a tournament like this, you're going to have to weather a storm,
[5131.00 - 5135.00] P:1955.76 E:0.289252 |  and there's been some storm in this second half, England have weathered.
[5135.00 - 5139.00] P:2018.08 E:0.284552 |  It's 1-1, BBC Radio 5 live, Phillips takes it short,
[5139.00 - 5143.00] P:1966.98 E:0.305922 |  fires it into the penalty area onto the head of Chiellini who knocks it down,
[5143.00 - 5147.00] P:2007.62 E:0.323045 |  and then the ball is played forward, but advances off Sucker, back to Chiesa,
[5147.00 - 5151.00] P:1993.43 E:0.302818 |  Chiesa again down the left-hand side, still going, Sucker's been able to get back,
[5151.00 - 5154.00] P:2050.13 E:0.303476 |  but Chiesa's still going, and then Phillips comes across
[5154.00 - 5157.00] P:1924.21 E:0.299100 |  and is able to get an important touch on the edge of the area,
[5157.00 - 5160.00] P:1938.92 E:0.317156 |  and then Sucker again is tripped, this time by Verratti again,
[5160.00 - 5165.00] P:1962.57 E:0.329526 |  and it's a great kick for England, and Chiesa's down in the end of the box.
[5166.00 - 5170.00] P:1988.19 E:0.344010 |  He gets the ball on that, touch line on the left-hand side,
[5170.00 - 5175.00] P:2011.77 E:0.290759 |  and Kyle Walker saying, go on then, push it, beat me in a foot race,
[5175.00 - 5181.00] P:1972.60 E:0.260883 |  chopped on the inside, I think Walker gets back, there is a coming together.
[5181.00 - 5184.00] P:1859.56 E:0.290066 |  Yeah, and he's, beyond capers, he's signaled on the medical people,
[5184.00 - 5187.00] P:1962.82 E:0.282276 |  so they're going to come and have a look at him on their trot,
[5187.00 - 5191.00] P:1944.49 E:0.311374 |  and we'll have a little stoppage here, which might be welcome for England.
[5191.00 - 5196.00] P:2011.81 E:0.300549 |  Italy won, England won, is the score on this Sunday night,
[5196.00 - 5203.00] P:1954.78 E:0.300343 |  on this cloudy, damp summer's evening here at Wembley Stadium.
[5203.00 - 5205.00] P:1918.10 E:0.285486 |  We've got the Open Championship for you next week,
[5205.00 - 5207.00] P:1880.31 E:0.293310 |  they'll have the preview on Wednesday night,
[5207.00 - 5212.00] P:1947.63 E:0.277437 |  we've got the Olympics from the 23rd of July across the BBC,
[5212.00 - 5216.00] P:1855.44 E:0.286127 |  and it's all over five live, and then we'll have more Premier League commentaries
[5216.00 - 5220.00] P:1977.65 E:0.281996 |  than anyone else next season, from Friday the 13th of August,
[5220.00 - 5223.00] P:1949.84 E:0.298767 |  it's only a few weeks away, but the summer of sport continues,
[5223.00 - 5228.00] P:1896.97 E:0.278929 |  but which way is it going to go in the big final here at Wembley tonight?
[5228.00 - 5232.00] P:1954.02 E:0.269652 |  Still, Chiesa is receiving treatment, let's bring in Karen Carney.
[5232.00 - 5236.00] P:1962.45 E:0.284872 |  Karen, the actions, all of the other end in this second half from where you are.
[5236.00 - 5240.00] P:1953.56 E:0.272208 |  I know, I'm really nervous because it's that end, but look, Steve Holland's come down,
[5240.00 - 5242.00] P:1968.57 E:0.290968 |  and whenever he comes down, he's got this tactical information,
[5242.00 - 5246.00] P:2021.40 E:0.316040 |  he's speaking to Raheem Sterling, and Luke Shaw, who are closest on the side,
[5246.00 - 5249.00] P:2017.83 E:0.282905 |  and he's literally signalled to them, get on the ball, you need to be brave,
[5249.00 - 5252.00] P:1921.18 E:0.277872 |  we need to be brave in possession, we cannot hide in this moment
[5252.00 - 5255.00] P:1888.97 E:0.288148 |  because we're taking pressure and pressure and pressure,
[5255.00 - 5258.00] P:1920.77 E:0.278373 |  we need to get on the ball, whether it's dribbling, passing,
[5258.00 - 5262.00] P:1930.98 E:0.261123 |  we need to gain more territory into this half.
[5262.00 - 5265.00] P:1957.94 E:0.309895 |  Still, Chiesa is receiving treatment, so this is a lengthy stoppage,
[5265.00 - 5270.00] P:1957.72 E:0.273236 |  81 minutes on the clock, discussions going on down there on the pitch
[5270.00 - 5276.00] P:1971.99 E:0.307038 |  between England players, Raheem Sterling standing in between Jordan Henderson and Kyle Walker.
[5276.00 - 5283.00] P:2016.42 E:0.329107 |  This would be a big pro for Italy, wouldn't it, because Chiesa has been
[5283.00 - 5289.00] P:2059.15 E:0.321354 |  such an important player for the Italians, offered a real threat,
[5289.00 - 5294.00] P:1999.70 E:0.306243 |  especially on this left-hand side, coming in on his right foot,
[5294.00 - 5296.00] P:2057.57 E:0.328597 |  he's not moving well at all.
[5296.00 - 5299.00] P:2007.08 E:0.270730 |  Well, he's got his right boot off, he's got it in his hand.
[5299.00 - 5305.00] P:2018.02 E:0.303953 |  Mancini calling, substitute up.
[5305.00 - 5310.00] P:1993.95 E:0.323560 |  So there will be a change, that's a severe loss for Italy,
[5310.00 - 5315.00] P:1991.06 E:0.329793 |  Chiesa has been outstanding, and Bernad Deski,
[5315.00 - 5321.00] P:1990.05 E:0.302724 |  Bernad Deski is coming on Federico Bernad Deski of Juventus,
[5321.00 - 5323.00] P:1955.42 E:0.270701 |  so that is it.
[5323.00 - 5327.00] P:1884.71 E:0.302767 |  Chiesa just limping off the field, some of the famous father, Italian,
[5327.00 - 5331.00] P:1899.51 E:0.289694 |  international, Enrico Chiesa,
[5331.00 - 5336.00] P:1834.95 E:0.309246 |  and he finally makes his way over the white line,
[5336.00 - 5340.00] P:1944.30 E:0.304263 |  and play resumes before the substitution is made.
[5340.00 - 5345.00] P:1935.55 E:0.296948 |  So England are playing just for the time being for a few moments at least against ten men.
[5345.00 - 5349.00] P:1903.12 E:0.277185 |  Italy won, England won, if you've just switched on.
[5349.00 - 5354.00] P:1934.13 E:0.304052 |  Tonight it's been high emotion, feelings running high,
[5354.00 - 5357.00] P:1814.55 E:0.321238 |  both inside and outside Wembley Stadium tonight,
[5357.00 - 5361.00] P:1952.37 E:0.307464 |  we'll have more on that later as well, the difficulties that have been outside of the ground this evening,
[5361.00 - 5367.00] P:1955.45 E:0.320495 |  some really concerning stories about some supporters getting into the ground,
[5367.00 - 5371.00] P:1934.51 E:0.324976 |  others not being able to get in, and Chiesa has come back onto the field,
[5371.00 - 5372.00] P:2020.92 E:0.266348 |  hence the chorus of booze.
[5372.00 - 5377.00] P:1950.92 E:0.249925 |  Mount on the left-hand side for England, Mount, plays it back to Shaw,
[5377.00 - 5381.00] P:1984.69 E:0.308382 |  wriggles his way on down the left wing and plays it to Mount, and mounts now in the bot,
[5381.00 - 5385.00] P:2013.03 E:0.295433 |  across it goes to Saka, it hits Saka and bounces down,
[5385.00 - 5390.00] P:1967.64 E:0.279677 |  and it bounced right into the path of Chialini, who is onto it, like a youngster,
[5390.00 - 5393.00] P:1973.85 E:0.288128 |  like a stripling, and cleared it away.
[5393.00 - 5397.00] P:1940.71 E:0.282395 |  Chialini, the old man, the captain of the Italian team, England come again,
[5397.00 - 5402.00] P:1969.77 E:0.322119 |  and that's the best we've seen from England, I think for the whole of the second half,
[5402.00 - 5404.00] P:1983.66 E:0.261306 |  from open play at least.
[5404.00 - 5411.00] P:1969.99 E:0.292659 |  One-one the score, so Chiesa is back on, Bernadeschi is still ready on that far side of the ground,
[5411.00 - 5416.00] P:1931.92 E:0.294962 |  just behind Roberto Mancini, England play to the right-hand side for Walker,
[5416.00 - 5420.00] P:1983.72 E:0.296523 |  Kyle Walker wants Saka to come close, which he does, and the Arsenal teenager,
[5420.00 - 5423.00] P:1903.11 E:0.315761 |  then stabs it back to Phillips, third, he's caught by Insignia,
[5423.00 - 5428.00] P:1994.89 E:0.307020 |  and that's a great kick to England, half way inside the half, towards the right-hand side,
[5428.00 - 5433.00] P:1971.89 E:0.313986 |  on a yellow card as well to Insignia for that challenge, just caught Phillips late, Chris.
[5433.00 - 5437.00] P:2020.74 E:0.331875 |  Yeah, and that's the best spell England have had in the second half, making a few passes,
[5437.00 - 5441.00] P:2035.32 E:0.314837 |  all played back from Saka, into Phillips, who takes the touch,
[5441.00 - 5445.00] P:1988.82 E:0.294695 |  Insignia goes to the ground, catches him, half way up, it's Shin,
[5445.00 - 5452.00] P:1967.59 E:0.270017 |  deserved yellow card and an opportunity for England, from this free kick.
[5452.00 - 5455.00] P:1843.10 E:0.283358 |  So Mason Mount is there, Jordan Henderson comes across,
[5455.00 - 5458.00] P:1871.91 E:0.289486 |  and he puts an arm around the shoulder of Bukai Osaka,
[5458.00 - 5461.00] P:1821.80 E:0.286942 |  and then points towards the penalty area, and then Jordan Henderson trots away,
[5461.00 - 5465.00] P:1907.56 E:0.289426 |  and takes up a position on the edge of the box, not another Henderson goal, surely,
[5465.00 - 5467.00] P:1962.21 E:0.293659 |  that would be too much to ask.
[5467.00 - 5471.00] P:2017.44 E:0.290195 |  So it's a free kick for England, Italy hold the line just outside their own box,
[5471.00 - 5475.00] P:2041.22 E:0.285757 |  Mount with the delivery, right-footed towards the back post, looking for stones,
[5475.00 - 5479.00] P:2015.81 E:0.282673 |  there was a jittering collision there, stones keeps his feet,
[5479.00 - 5484.00] P:2001.28 E:0.302838 |  Shaw arrives on the volley, but sends it high in the way over the top of the bar,
[5484.00 - 5488.00] P:1957.17 E:0.293979 |  into the England fans behind the goal, and it is 1-1,
[5488.00 - 5492.00] P:1953.39 E:0.264522 |  and we have less than five minutes to go,
[5492.00 - 5496.00] P:1915.26 E:0.297563 |  and Bernadeschi is coming on now for Kieze, he's had a goal,
[5496.00 - 5500.00] P:1952.01 E:0.296594 |  and he's clearly decided he's not going to be able to continue,
[5500.00 - 5507.00] P:1983.46 E:0.274947 |  so on will come Federico Bernadeschi to win his 34th cap, the Juventus man,
[5507.00 - 5512.00] P:1998.17 E:0.323302 |  came on as a late substitute in the semi-final, if you remember,
[5512.00 - 5516.00] P:2005.33 E:0.323638 |  and took one of the penalties against Spain on Tuesday night.
[5516.00 - 5521.00] P:2032.99 E:0.320168 |  But he's had a very good tournament, Kieze, Chris Sutton, he has,
[5521.00 - 5526.00] P:2036.90 E:0.305618 |  and I think this is a big, big blow for the Italians,
[5526.00 - 5531.00] P:1949.23 E:0.321886 |  but a good second half, Kieze in take-hold, much of their forward play,
[5531.00 - 5534.00] P:1909.48 E:0.313907 |  and it'll be interesting how the Italians shape up now,
[5534.00 - 5538.00] P:1915.47 E:0.329488 |  where Bernadeschi fits into this Italian team,
[5538.00 - 5541.00] P:1965.13 E:0.255746 |  looks like he's gone to play centre-forward in Signia,
[5541.00 - 5546.00] P:1926.20 E:0.247475 |  out to the left, Bernadeschi at his best, off the right-hand side,
[5546.00 - 5549.00] P:2019.82 E:0.230110 |  coming in on his left foot.
[5549.00 - 5552.00] P:1956.00 E:0.282771 |  Italy with a ball on the edge of their own penalty area,
[5552.00 - 5559.00] P:1974.91 E:0.265298 |  extra time is not far away, just over four minutes of the 90 to play, 1-1,
[5559.00 - 5564.00] P:1894.35 E:0.244498 |  but Italy have busted in the second half, Verratti,
[5564.00 - 5568.00] P:1928.30 E:0.286095 |  Verratti puts his foot on the ball, plays it back to Chiellini behind him,
[5568.00 - 5572.00] P:1939.63 E:0.308518 |  and it's a bit of a darkness now at Wembley, all of the floodlights in full effect,
[5572.00 - 5575.00] P:1974.16 E:0.291862 |  as the ball has played through for Italy, but Bernadeschi can't reach that,
[5575.00 - 5578.00] P:1985.26 E:0.326119 |  and it runs away through to Pickford, who's able to pick it up.
[5578.00 - 5581.00] P:1907.57 E:0.325518 |  So once the final is over, we'll bring you the presentation,
[5581.00 - 5583.00] P:1866.06 E:0.316180 |  we'll bring you live interviews from Pitchside,
[5583.00 - 5586.00] P:1845.17 E:0.326262 |  and then it'll be the 6-0-6-4-0 to talk about it,
[5586.00 - 5591.00] P:1870.06 E:0.326398 |  but England are just hanging on there in this final,
[5591.00 - 5595.00] P:1926.17 E:0.332056 |  and oh, we've got two people who've run on the field.
[5595.00 - 5598.00] P:1931.62 E:0.336864 |  It's actually one person who's pulled his shirt off,
[5598.00 - 5603.00] P:1931.29 E:0.323753 |  and then the stewards are trying to catch up with him,
[5603.00 - 5608.00] P:2020.14 E:0.340021 |  and he's being chased away,
[5608.00 - 5611.00] P:1917.50 E:0.308415 |  just hope he doesn't run into any of the players, that's all.
[5613.00 - 5615.00] P:1925.12 E:0.342822 |  This is the last thing we need,
[5615.00 - 5621.00] P:2004.97 E:0.335527 |  and he's eventually run off the field, and he's been caught up by the stewards.
[5621.00 - 5623.00] P:1924.27 E:0.335116 |  So the players have got a moment or two,
[5623.00 - 5625.00] P:1999.83 E:0.338638 |  and in fact, he's managed to get away from them again,
[5625.00 - 5628.00] P:2019.42 E:0.320809 |  and he's still running around on the field,
[5628.00 - 5633.00] P:1874.39 E:0.316609 |  and eventually he runs out of steam, and he's going to be taken away.
[5633.00 - 5637.00] P:1887.12 E:0.316650 |  I wouldn't be at all surprised if he was one of the unpleasant individuals
[5637.00 - 5642.00] P:1886.00 E:0.293370 |  who's been able to get into Wembley Stadium without having a ticket,
[5642.00 - 5643.00] P:1957.21 E:0.338275 |  and off he goes.
[5643.00 - 5645.00] P:1996.62 E:0.304461 |  What a moron.
[5646.00 - 5652.00] P:1928.60 E:0.308924 |  So that will mean that we'll have some time to be added on at the end of the match.
[5652.00 - 5654.00] P:1893.70 E:0.326670 |  Well, it's a shame, John, isn't it?
[5654.00 - 5659.00] P:1916.89 E:0.275306 |  You know, second half England have really struggled to get out,
[5659.00 - 5662.00] P:1891.94 E:0.270878 |  and Italy have been in the ascendancy,
[5662.00 - 5665.00] P:1955.70 E:0.272161 |  and it's just disrupted the flow of the game.
[5666.00 - 5668.00] P:1913.67 E:0.299171 |  So it is Italy one, England one.
[5668.00 - 5671.00] P:1969.08 E:0.271085 |  We might well have extra time on the way.
[5671.00 - 5675.00] P:1975.58 E:0.283969 |  Pickford gets the ball under control, and gives it out to Stones,
[5675.00 - 5678.00] P:1963.39 E:0.286325 |  flights it forward towards the halfway line,
[5678.00 - 5680.00] P:1979.88 E:0.312648 |  and then it comes off the head of Anderson.
[5680.00 - 5682.00] P:2004.36 E:0.297869 |  And it's a play for an England throw.
[5682.00 - 5685.00] P:1857.06 E:0.288405 |  So if you haven't heard, goodness knows what have you been doing,
[5685.00 - 5688.00] P:1909.61 E:0.307307 |  but England took the lead in the second minute through Luxe Hall,
[5688.00 - 5690.00] P:1904.92 E:0.249508 |  brilliantly worked goal,
[5690.00 - 5694.00] P:1932.51 E:0.272308 |  and England really had the spirit of Wembley behind them
[5694.00 - 5698.00] P:1893.14 E:0.284370 |  in that opening period that Italy have more than worked their way back into this.
[5698.00 - 5700.00] P:1920.43 E:0.339937 |  And the new G equalised in the second half,
[5700.00 - 5702.00] P:1897.34 E:0.310812 |  but here's Sterling now setting off on a run into the penalty area,
[5702.00 - 5704.00] P:2019.63 E:0.303638 |  still going, blue shirts all around him,
[5704.00 - 5707.00] P:2008.53 E:0.286002 |  takes it to the byline bit, overruns it, couldn't pull it back,
[5707.00 - 5710.00] P:2007.07 E:0.296229 |  Sapper and Kane in the middle bit, but Sterling,
[5710.00 - 5713.00] P:1983.09 E:0.312589 |  that's the electricity that England has been missing in the second half.
[5713.00 - 5716.00] P:2013.14 E:0.296753 |  Absolutely, haven't seen this enough Sterling,
[5716.00 - 5721.00] P:2021.71 E:0.263703 |  driving on the inside, positive play, little shift past Benucci,
[5721.00 - 5725.00] P:1993.94 E:0.258892 |  and it just goes over the byline,
[5725.00 - 5729.00] P:2013.26 E:0.289562 |  but more positive in the last 10 minutes from England.
[5732.00 - 5736.00] P:1955.39 E:0.282995 |  But Italy have got it again, in the 89th minute,
[5736.00 - 5739.00] P:1945.40 E:0.315974 |  I think they'll be at least four, maybe five,
[5739.00 - 5743.00] P:1886.41 E:0.293667 |  maybe even six minutes, about a time at the end of the 90th.
[5743.00 - 5748.00] P:1956.50 E:0.314627 |  Wall Square, you don't think it's the biggest shock of all time,
[5748.00 - 5752.00] P:1843.95 E:0.296134 |  if this final goes to extra time this evening,
[5752.00 - 5759.00] P:1881.17 E:0.300311 |  I know quite a number of the experts were suggesting it could go all the way to the penalties.
[5759.00 - 5762.00] P:1985.23 E:0.337303 |  Verratti passing it forward, Phillips there,
[5762.00 - 5767.00] P:2008.63 E:0.314856 |  excellent little interception from Phillips to take it away from Christanty,
[5767.00 - 5769.00] P:1937.80 E:0.278399 |  he carries it out to the left-hand side,
[5769.00 - 5774.00] P:1925.40 E:0.313260 |  Sterling is there, Sterling comes in field, goes down, was he caught,
[5774.00 - 5779.00] P:2000.85 E:0.313552 |  no says referee Kipers, no free kick for Sterling, no free kick for England,
[5779.00 - 5782.00] P:1886.46 E:0.276089 |  now Bernadeschi has it on the halfway line for Italy,
[5782.00 - 5784.00] P:1930.84 E:0.314560 |  he's taken out to the far side, he puts in field,
[5784.00 - 5788.00] P:1962.59 E:0.325094 |  and then Calvin Phillips is there again for England to block it out of play,
[5788.00 - 5790.00] P:1978.38 E:0.325255 |  referee Kipers says that's a throw into England,
[5790.00 - 5795.00] P:1922.38 E:0.305334 |  Bernadeschi can't believe, runs towards the referee, gestures here and there.
[5795.00 - 5798.00] P:1845.29 E:0.313116 |  Yeah, not enough in there, Sterling goes to ground too easily,
[5798.00 - 5803.00] P:2027.74 E:0.297908 |  as the boy who cried wolf, isn't he, and that's the problem,
[5803.00 - 5807.00] P:1992.32 E:0.302934 |  gets a reputation for himself for going down too easily,
[5807.00 - 5809.00] P:1975.48 E:0.287268 |  and the referee not buying it.
[5809.00 - 5812.00] P:1901.33 E:0.302771 |  I think we might need some energy drinks, Chris, in a moment or two,
[5812.00 - 5816.00] P:1947.04 E:0.296358 |  for half time, and what else might follow,
[5816.00 - 5819.00] P:2004.44 E:0.294927 |  but Italy have got it back,
[5819.00 - 5824.00] P:1952.21 E:0.322034 |  the goal now would probably see whoever scores it crowned European champions,
[5824.00 - 5827.00] P:1947.25 E:0.327319 |  and there's another piercing whistle from Kipers,
[5827.00 - 5830.00] P:1955.36 E:0.302510 |  because it's a foul this time on Raheem Sterling,
[5830.00 - 5834.00] P:1915.56 E:0.305049 |  and I run it, cheers, because Sterling has got a free kick for England,
[5834.00 - 5837.00] P:1954.02 E:0.317200 |  but it's only seven or eight yards inside the Italian heart.
[5837.00 - 5841.00] P:1994.00 E:0.304933 |  It is six minutes of added time, six minutes of added time,
[5841.00 - 5845.00] P:2035.32 E:0.313736 |  so set piece, Shaw is standing there with his foot on the ball,
[5845.00 - 5848.00] P:2040.70 E:0.287431 |  not unlike the pose that Bobby Moore strikes,
[5848.00 - 5852.00] P:1949.03 E:0.308379 |  his statue outside Wembley Stadium on that side of the ground.
[5852.00 - 5855.00] P:1995.74 E:0.294505 |  Shaw waiting to take this free kick.
[5855.00 - 5858.00] P:1985.05 E:0.291464 |  Harry Kane, the England captain tonight,
[5858.00 - 5861.00] P:1938.17 E:0.307946 |  further sport in the middle, Henderson there as well,
[5861.00 - 5865.00] P:1985.54 E:0.296359 |  the central defenders of course, Shaw high indeed towards Maguire,
[5865.00 - 5868.00] P:1968.96 E:0.272606 |  who gets up, heads it across the Italian box,
[5868.00 - 5870.00] P:1957.22 E:0.292528 |  but that's worn against stones on the edge of the area,
[5870.00 - 5873.00] P:1953.12 E:0.285127 |  and then there's a trip in there,
[5873.00 - 5876.00] P:2007.06 E:0.299336 |  on Verratti, and it's a free kick to Italy,
[5876.00 - 5880.00] P:1942.39 E:0.288480 |  and we've already played over a minute of the six of added time.
[5880.00 - 5883.00] P:1986.86 E:0.271588 |  He's been influential, hasn't he, Verratti?
[5883.00 - 5888.00] P:1898.69 E:0.302224 |  In this second half for the Italians, snapping and snarling.
[5890.00 - 5893.00] P:1928.27 E:0.323416 |  Lock in Italian Jack Russell, isn't he?
[5893.00 - 5895.00] P:1979.16 E:0.322123 |  Italy take the free kick,
[5895.00 - 5897.00] P:1971.26 E:0.314425 |  and then shuffle it towards the halfway line,
[5897.00 - 5902.00] P:1922.64 E:0.285756 |  and then yap, yap, here's the little Italian Jack Russell, Verratti,
[5903.00 - 5906.00] P:1936.49 E:0.289537 |  gets it back from Giorgio Gigno,
[5906.00 - 5910.00] P:1909.96 E:0.320472 |  and Italy just holding possession inside their own heart.
[5911.00 - 5916.00] P:1893.90 E:0.329870 |  Really tense, anxious moments in this final here at Wembley,
[5916.00 - 5918.00] P:1954.99 E:0.331249 |  and Italy work it down the right-hand side,
[5918.00 - 5920.00] P:1850.33 E:0.307249 |  Cristanti swings over the cross,
[5920.00 - 5923.00] P:1921.32 E:0.304525 |  but beyond Insenia he couldn't reach that,
[5923.00 - 5926.00] P:1973.21 E:0.327083 |  while Walker's gone with him, Kyle Walker has managed to dispossess him.
[5926.00 - 5928.00] P:1922.02 E:0.332573 |  That's a nice ball from Henderson,
[5928.00 - 5933.00] P:1989.02 E:0.328302 |  but it was read by Chiellini, who just moved across,
[5933.00 - 5937.00] P:1954.62 E:0.297381 |  glided across, he might be thinning on top,
[5937.00 - 5940.00] P:1914.03 E:0.277000 |  but there's plenty going on inside that head of his,
[5940.00 - 5942.00] P:1852.89 E:0.300769 |  when he got there before Saka.
[5942.00 - 5944.00] P:1935.43 E:0.284150 |  I think Saka had a little look,
[5944.00 - 5946.00] P:1885.58 E:0.318611 |  saw him coming out of the corner of his eye.
[5946.00 - 5947.00] P:1983.50 E:0.259946 |  Pickford's long pass,
[5947.00 - 5951.00] P:1940.08 E:0.308583 |  oh, it's glanced back by Benucci to Donnarumma,
[5951.00 - 5955.00] P:1879.58 E:0.272399 |  that was cool, that was cool by the other man at the back for Italy.
[5955.00 - 5957.00] P:1851.64 E:0.259245 |  Little thumbs up,
[5957.00 - 5959.00] P:1889.48 E:0.269008 |  just got a rumour there from Benucci.
[5962.00 - 5964.00] P:1915.35 E:0.337928 |  Class from the two of them,
[5964.00 - 5967.00] P:1958.26 E:0.330092 |  within a few seconds of one another.
[5967.00 - 5970.00] P:1987.65 E:0.336875 |  Now the ball's been driven forward by Giorgio Gigno,
[5970.00 - 5972.00] P:1983.34 E:0.320565 |  he has Emerson on the left-hand side,
[5972.00 - 5975.00] P:1930.22 E:0.270699 |  still 1-1 in added time,
[5975.00 - 5978.00] P:1954.43 E:0.303064 |  Verratti, Italian's playing it up towards Emerson,
[5978.00 - 5982.00] P:1953.36 E:0.326904 |  Chiellini is there, gets there and uses Emerson,
[5982.00 - 5984.00] P:1892.88 E:0.299447 |  now it's back towards Verratti,
[5984.00 - 5987.00] P:1893.24 E:0.317931 |  and then again Verratti receives it,
[5987.00 - 5991.00] P:1954.21 E:0.345195 |  Italian players with dominating the possession statistics,
[5991.00 - 5993.00] P:1961.91 E:0.318617 |  there's no question of that,
[5993.00 - 5994.00] P:1968.99 E:0.271108 |  Chiellini again,
[5994.00 - 5996.00] P:1779.59 E:0.330456 |  Chiellini almost on the left wing,
[5996.00 - 5998.00] P:1967.63 E:0.305325 |  Verratti, now,
[5998.00 - 6000.00] P:1964.98 E:0.337010 |  Verratti back onto his right foot, plays it square,
[6000.00 - 6003.00] P:1978.72 E:0.348208 |  there's no-one's through the middle for Italy at all.
[6003.00 - 6007.00] P:1966.18 E:0.335786 |  They're playing with a false nine on, they burn a deski,
[6007.00 - 6009.00] P:1999.13 E:0.334550 |  just dropping into those areas,
[6009.00 - 6012.00] P:1978.10 E:0.333416 |  trying to draw McGuire out and stones out.
[6012.00 - 6015.00] P:2007.12 E:0.301371 |  We're in the 94th minute extra time,
[6015.00 - 6017.00] P:1959.54 E:0.315035 |  just a couple of minutes away,
[6017.00 - 6020.00] P:1979.82 E:0.312604 |  Verratti, the deskies come short,
[6020.00 - 6024.00] P:1876.52 E:0.316465 |  it's played square towards Giorgio,
[6024.00 - 6026.00] P:1978.37 E:0.309544 |  Pristanti is furthest forward,
[6026.00 - 6030.00] P:1918.81 E:0.324218 |  but it is Verratti who then rolls it back into the centre-circle,
[6030.00 - 6035.00] P:1958.47 E:0.323266 |  and Italy, surely they will have a dart,
[6035.00 - 6038.00] P:1966.20 E:0.315666 |  and try and win it in normal time, you would think.
[6038.00 - 6042.00] P:1937.83 E:0.315302 |  Insignia plays it back, still patient from Verratti,
[6042.00 - 6046.00] P:1958.14 E:0.312095 |  Verratti now, Saka cuts out that pass, Henderson lifts it forward,
[6046.00 - 6049.00] P:1946.25 E:0.296687 |  Kane gets a touch, but there's no-one up there for England,
[6049.00 - 6054.00] P:1987.96 E:0.314347 |  and Chiellini can just come back and kick up possession for Italy again.
[6054.00 - 6057.00] P:1930.61 E:0.317460 |  Kane is so deep, England are so deep,
[6057.00 - 6060.00] P:1997.33 E:0.308731 |  I just wonder whether Gareth missed a trick,
[6060.00 - 6062.00] P:2006.62 E:0.334196 |  not making another change, getting a grilichon,
[6062.00 - 6066.00] P:2012.53 E:0.343559 |  or somebody who can hold onto the ball,
[6066.00 - 6070.00] P:2050.91 E:0.329063 |  keeping the ball, he's made only two changes so far, Gareth's out there,
[6070.00 - 6073.00] P:2066.74 E:0.333037 |  and at the moment, you're struggling to see,
[6073.00 - 6075.00] P:2042.34 E:0.321185 |  apart from perhaps a set, please,
[6075.00 - 6078.00] P:2014.83 E:0.320843 |  how England actually might trouble Italy,
[6078.00 - 6081.00] P:1995.76 E:0.309005 |  for what it goes, on the right-hand side, Pristanti,
[6081.00 - 6084.00] P:1951.58 E:0.291959 |  now Verratti, this could be dangerous,
[6084.00 - 6086.00] P:2027.66 E:0.317076 |  the ball's lifted in towards the back post,
[6086.00 - 6088.00] P:2001.91 E:0.295078 |  Walker chests it back to Pickford,
[6088.00 - 6091.00] P:1992.44 E:0.321269 |  that was cool, that was cool alright,
[6091.00 - 6093.00] P:1994.57 E:0.333137 |  he done that, come on Walker,
[6093.00 - 6095.00] P:1833.06 E:0.316428 |  long one downfield, but there's no chance,
[6095.00 - 6098.00] P:1950.27 E:0.306725 |  Mount will reach that, it bounces through to Donor-Roma,
[6098.00 - 6104.00] P:1943.73 E:0.317555 |  we are almost into the very last minute of added time,
[6104.00 - 6106.00] P:1941.26 E:0.307169 |  it's still Italy won, England won,
[6106.00 - 6109.00] P:2026.52 E:0.316117 |  it's hardly, it's up John, there's no Walker,
[6109.00 - 6111.00] P:2002.69 E:0.333980 |  there is space over there on the far side,
[6111.00 - 6113.00] P:1974.87 E:0.307648 |  in fact the ball's played through the middle,
[6113.00 - 6115.00] P:1955.47 E:0.280218 |  Calvin Phillips, importantly, went with it,
[6115.00 - 6118.00] P:1900.41 E:0.318689 |  and was able to hook it away under pressure on the edge of the post,
[6118.00 - 6121.00] P:1935.42 E:0.318036 |  Cal Walker, England just hitting it, long now,
[6121.00 - 6124.00] P:1934.52 E:0.313636 |  Harry Kane with the challenge, but Bernucci comes across,
[6124.00 - 6126.00] P:1789.92 E:0.311993 |  he wins the header, Bernadeschi through the middle,
[6126.00 - 6129.00] P:1891.95 E:0.322233 |  Bernucci has taken a clattering from Harry Kane in that challenge,
[6129.00 - 6132.00] P:1975.38 E:0.314375 |  Saka then wins it back for England,
[6132.00 - 6134.00] P:1939.17 E:0.322202 |  Jordan Henderson takes it down,
[6134.00 - 6136.00] P:1935.71 E:0.306646 |  bollys it forward for Saka, Kealini's come across,
[6136.00 - 6138.00] P:2004.27 E:0.348343 |  he's pulled him over blatantly,
[6138.00 - 6141.00] P:1961.54 E:0.330498 |  Saka went round the outside of Kealini,
[6141.00 - 6146.00] P:1941.80 E:0.312164 |  and it was almost like something out of the cartoons,
[6146.00 - 6150.00] P:1923.27 E:0.305164 |  the way that Kealini got a hold of the scruff of Saka's neck,
[6150.00 - 6154.00] P:1939.83 E:0.309606 |  and pulled him back, and it's a free kick for England,
[6154.00 - 6156.00] P:1879.62 E:0.303814 |  a yellow card for Kealini.
[6156.00 - 6161.00] P:1964.02 E:0.303900 |  I mean that's an assault, isn't it, from Kealini,
[6161.00 - 6164.00] P:1920.02 E:0.308946 |  he's thrown it at the ball, run out to play Saka,
[6164.00 - 6166.00] P:1923.01 E:0.328638 |  just creeps him behind him,
[6166.00 - 6169.00] P:1938.82 E:0.306308 |  and he's going to get away, and Kealini knows he's not getting back,
[6169.00 - 6174.00] P:1945.63 E:0.317412 |  and hauls him down, like a wrestling move.
[6174.00 - 6176.00] P:1970.68 E:0.324047 |  As I said, it was like the cartoons, the legs were going,
[6176.00 - 6177.00] P:1769.25 E:0.316821 |  the legs were whirling around,
[6177.00 - 6179.00] P:1890.07 E:0.310736 |  but he was holding onto the back of his neck,
[6180.00 - 6182.00] P:1961.16 E:0.293289 |  Italy won, England won, last chance then,
[6182.00 - 6185.00] P:1982.89 E:0.262868 |  for a goal in normal time.
[6185.00 - 6189.00] P:1959.09 E:0.318448 |  Fired forward by Phillips, headed away for Italy,
[6189.00 - 6191.00] P:1909.60 E:0.299922 |  and there it is, the final whistle,
[6191.00 - 6195.00] P:1954.43 E:0.291856 |  one-one, after England led at halftime,
[6195.00 - 6197.00] P:1842.84 E:0.292644 |  that early goal in the second minute from Luke Shaw,
[6197.00 - 6199.00] P:1944.93 E:0.296822 |  and with a better team in the first half,
[6199.00 - 6201.00] P:1844.97 E:0.281710 |  the system worked well,
[6201.00 - 6204.00] P:1770.30 E:0.265873 |  but then Italy have absolutely dominated it
[6204.00 - 6205.00] P:1752.13 E:0.285191 |  in the second half,
[6205.00 - 6208.00] P:1674.47 E:0.283483 |  and England really, at times, have been at sixes and sevens,
[6208.00 - 6213.76] P:1910.70 E:0.245892 |  Benucci got the goal from close range after Pickford brilliantly saved Verati's effort
[6213.76 - 6220.84] P:1817.84 E:0.260686 |  under a post, but it's 1-1 and the way that the game has gone heading into extra time,
[6220.84 - 6223.24] P:1977.37 E:0.273214 |  are we saying Italy big favourites Chris Sutter?
[6223.24 - 6227.76] P:1944.59 E:0.300265 |  I think so, wouldn't be surprised if Gareth made changes England are on the ropes, they
[6227.76 - 6233.04] P:1881.35 E:0.270408 |  need smelling salts, it has been so one sided the second half, Italy deserve to get back
[6233.04 - 6237.12] P:1861.93 E:0.274404 |  into the game, they've been the dominant force and going into extra time you've got
[6237.12 - 6242.88] P:2026.42 E:0.229675 |  to say, I'm worried for England.
[6242.88 - 6251.00] P:1961.09 E:0.277734 |  So Italy won, England won and the final goes to extra time, no further changes for either
[6251.00 - 6255.92] P:1850.06 E:0.288594 |  team at the start of extra time, oh no hang on there is, there is going to be a change
[6255.92 - 6263.56] P:1740.73 E:0.280195 |  and it's the rooster Chris, Andrea Bellotti, they call him the rooster and he is going
[6263.56 - 6268.08] P:1885.86 E:0.289137 |  to come on, so they are going to have a man through the middle, that's what Roberto Mancini
[6268.08 - 6275.72] P:1661.91 E:0.295282 |  has decided and it is little insignia isn't it, who's made way, so insignia is off and
[6275.72 - 6286.72] P:1833.31 E:0.291174 |  the Napoli captain makes way and is replaced by the Torino captain, Bellotti who's yet
[6286.88 - 6294.76] P:1954.00 E:0.281781 |  to score at the tournament but has certainly played his part for Italy having come on now
[6294.76 - 6300.88] P:1994.27 E:0.292016 |  in five of the six matches, so off we go in extra time in the Euro 2020 final and immediately
[6300.88 - 6305.60] P:1903.83 E:0.282240 |  Verratti closes down John Stones and the ball bounces out of play for a throw into England
[6305.60 - 6308.48] P:1904.03 E:0.277933 |  over there on the far side.
[6308.48 - 6314.48] P:1925.15 E:0.335963 |  I just wonder with the Italian substitution whether insignia has an injury of some sort
[6314.76 - 6319.12] P:1898.68 E:0.316147 |  because he is such a live wire, such a creator for the Italian team, they have gone a different
[6319.12 - 6323.32] P:1778.31 E:0.307274 |  way now where will see Bellotti, he will play up against the English centre halfs, John
[6323.32 - 6329.96] P:1857.50 E:0.288912 |  Stones and Harry Maguire, they like that better, they struggled with when Insignu was dropping
[6329.96 - 6336.24] P:2043.51 E:0.326377 |  in to little pockets of play, the same with Bernadeschi, Bernadeschi over to the left hand
[6336.24 - 6337.24] P:2069.79 E:0.330358 |  side now.
[6338.00 - 6347.56] P:1972.19 E:0.297433 |  So the Wembley crowd, the attendance by the way is 67,173 for this European Championship
[6347.56 - 6354.48] P:1948.02 E:0.309194 |  final, England's first final since 1966 got off to a roaring start, just a few seconds
[6354.48 - 6362.24] P:1935.98 E:0.281463 |  after the red arrows roared over the stadium, Luke Shaw with a blinding goal but Italy slowly
[6362.24 - 6367.64] P:1920.21 E:0.304409 |  but surely have taken charge and here they go, all in England players gone down and clattered
[6367.64 - 6371.76] P:1949.41 E:0.286210 |  down to the ground, it's Jordan Henderson and as the ball was played past him there
[6371.76 - 6377.64] P:1907.39 E:0.264681 |  was a collision there and he took a right crack I think on the head and has gone down
[6377.64 - 6384.48] P:1862.47 E:0.282522 |  in the right back position, yes he actually ran into Emerson as he chased Bernadeschi down
[6384.48 - 6385.48] P:1825.98 E:0.262834 |  the left.
[6385.48 - 6390.40] P:1922.72 E:0.287381 |  Emerson knows what he's doing, the old basketball block that jump from Emerson.
[6391.04 - 6396.36] P:1914.60 E:0.301145 |  And Henderson's got straight up and hasn't needed any treatment or a check at all and
[6396.36 - 6399.92] P:1900.95 E:0.297795 |  he did seem to take quite a clatter there to make this.
[6399.92 - 6406.96] P:1915.55 E:0.318064 |  You know he did, he did look good to see him up and back on his feet, it is.
[6406.96 - 6413.84] P:1882.59 E:0.296745 |  So Italy won, England won, BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service, many of the BBC's local
[6413.84 - 6419.52] P:1910.80 E:0.294801 |  radio stations listening as well via BBC Sounds late night drama for you from the Euros, the
[6419.60 - 6427.96] P:1988.08 E:0.300053 |  last night of the Euros and a high foot has made contact with Harry Maguire's face and
[6427.96 - 6433.76] P:1924.16 E:0.290999 |  Bernadeschi is all full of apologies, it was just a hand, I think it might have been the
[6433.76 - 6438.72] P:1900.65 E:0.302903 |  side of his hand flicking in the eye and it's a free kick, he lifted his foot but I think
[6438.72 - 6441.04] P:1980.80 E:0.320096 |  it was a flailing arm that caught Maguire.
[6441.04 - 6444.28] P:1896.43 E:0.310141 |  Pickford plays the free kick out to storms on the right hand side.
[6444.36 - 6450.44] P:1792.01 E:0.297152 |  It's really getting after England, the Italians pressing high, I don't know if Maguire touched on it,
[6450.44 - 6456.60] P:1958.04 E:0.324045 |  quite the need but you know Gareth maybe uses Bench, they haven't held onto the ball well,
[6456.60 - 6458.68] P:1979.03 E:0.273740 |  I think it's crying out for a grelish.
[6458.68 - 6463.80] P:1906.75 E:0.309557 |  Crying out for a grelish, I would agree with you Chris, he has Mount, Mount turns on the
[6463.80 - 6470.04] P:1988.53 E:0.307511 |  halfway line, Shaw receives it from him, he has two Italians immediately closing him down,
[6470.36 - 6476.04] P:1932.13 E:0.316201 |  it's no sign of movement over there on the England benches but I think Italy are preparing at
[6476.04 - 6481.48] P:1976.80 E:0.303937 |  least one more change, a way over on the far side next to the mouth of the tunnel where it says
[6481.48 - 6484.76] P:1986.19 E:0.318188 |  the final written above the tunnel entrance.
[6484.76 - 6490.12] P:1988.20 E:0.308452 |  Oh England take the throw, Shaw, Phillips who just passed it straight out of play at close quarters
[6490.12 - 6497.00] P:1937.89 E:0.289527 |  and the two of them exchange words, just had a glance at one another, Lenkatelli who's stripped
[6497.72 - 6502.60] P:1925.14 E:0.311616 |  and he's had a good tournament, can't get any Italian starting lineup.
[6503.48 - 6511.24] P:1842.03 E:0.320316 |  Yep started the tournament like Italy and now all Raheem Sterling has conceded a free kick
[6512.12 - 6520.92] P:1916.35 E:0.300364 |  and Giorginho had a little go back because Sterling just leaned in and then landed on
[6520.92 - 6525.64] P:1830.91 E:0.302382 |  Giorginho and Giorginho didn't think much of that, Chelsea Manchester City that one,
[6526.52 - 6533.40] P:1860.80 E:0.301637 |  Italy one, England one and here is Kylini and Benucci bringing the ball out from the back,
[6534.04 - 6542.92] P:1925.78 E:0.300076 |  Benucci, he was the man who came up with the equaliser, that was in the 67th minute, Italy
[6542.92 - 6549.64] P:1941.24 E:0.316580 |  trailed for a long long time well 65 minutes in the match. Going on holiday together John after
[6549.80 - 6553.72] P:1955.06 E:0.314720 |  the tournament, Benucci and Kylini, where do you think they're going?
[6556.04 - 6558.12] P:1930.03 E:0.341653 |  The Amalfi coast maybe?
[6561.08 - 6567.56] P:1936.64 E:0.305770 |  And the ball is played back to Benucci, Benucci a long right-footed ball picked for
[6567.56 - 6572.60] P:2020.96 E:0.321680 |  Cungs and made to comfortable captain in no particular pressure so England have got it again
[6573.16 - 6578.60] P:1896.11 E:0.294192 |  and Lockertelli is waiting to come on the number five over there, another one of the
[6578.60 - 6587.48] P:1894.85 E:0.305414 |  Saswolo crew in this Italian squad and Stones, four to Phillips, Phillips little left hand side to
[6587.48 - 6594.44] P:1946.74 E:0.333173 |  Shaw, Shaw rolls the ball towards Mount who took a heavy touch there, the ball rebounds in field,
[6594.44 - 6599.96] P:1964.82 E:0.311810 |  Henderson, lovely pass for Henderson to Sterling in the box on the left hand side but then who
[6599.96 - 6606.76] P:1926.17 E:0.316462 |  arrives on the scene sliding in to Blockert behind for a corner, Kylini of course and look at it
[6606.76 - 6614.76] P:2006.13 E:0.313312 |  celebration Kylini sticks out his chest there's a heavy touch from Mount in England, get away with
[6614.76 - 6619.72] P:2002.52 E:0.297964 |  it in the ball, I think it's a ricochet, he goes through to Sterling, he's driving the left hand
[6619.72 - 6626.36] P:1948.60 E:0.301748 |  side of the box and all of a sudden from nowhere Kylini comes across and makes a block, yeah Kylini
[6626.36 - 6632.20] P:1911.07 E:0.321808 |  was pleased with himself there and uh and rightly so as well it's Verratti who's coming off,
[6632.20 - 6637.72] P:1983.79 E:0.298317 |  Lockertelli coming on for Verratti so a straight swap, Kylini's often pleased with himself
[6639.64 - 6646.28] P:1913.87 E:0.310328 |  we didn't incidentally see any of the antics for the coin toss at the start of extra time that we saw
[6646.28 - 6652.04] P:1949.31 E:0.304064 |  with, oh no that was actually before the penalty, that was before the penalty between Kane and Kylini,
[6652.04 - 6656.36] P:1974.98 E:0.289322 |  corner for England, Shaw takes it towards the back post, it's headed out, it's headed out to Phillips,
[6656.36 - 6661.88] P:2056.13 E:0.288537 |  Phillips drives it low across the face of goal through a crowd of players, I think
[6661.88 - 6666.52] P:1962.32 E:0.306335 |  Donnarumma was a little concerned but it was why probably by a couple of yards or more actually
[6667.08 - 6675.48] P:1976.85 E:0.313044 |  the ball sits up 23-24 yards out, Phillips off the chest, yeah it's four or five yards wide,
[6675.48 - 6680.84] P:1964.33 E:0.289407 |  it's a clean connection but well wide of Donnarumma's right hand post
[6683.08 - 6690.12] P:1934.21 E:0.300707 |  so now we're into extra time that means a maximum of six substitutions and for Italy now that is
[6690.12 - 6695.00] P:1913.48 E:0.301429 |  five so Roberto Montchini still has one left up his sleeve if he I don't know if he needs
[6695.00 - 6702.76] P:1944.62 E:0.305261 |  perhaps to make one for penalties so we've had six minutes of extra time, Italy won, England won
[6703.72 - 6708.68] P:1943.74 E:0.299683 |  and Italy now bringing the ball towards the halfway line, scooped through the middle, headed
[6708.68 - 6715.08] P:1976.62 E:0.301862 |  forward, McGuire underneath that, here's Harry Kane, had a quiet second half certainly, Henderson
[6715.08 - 6719.72] P:1964.62 E:0.321263 |  takes it on from him, over Henderson's pass for the outside of his boot is some distance behind
[6719.80 - 6726.52] P:1978.42 E:0.315563 |  Sterling and just bounces into the hoardings for a throw in to Italy, then England has to say
[6726.52 - 6732.28] P:1908.08 E:0.285015 |  they've just been really ragged, I think Karen Carney's got some news that England supporters might
[6732.28 - 6736.60] P:1976.66 E:0.298377 |  want to hear Karen, absolutely Jack Greely she's coming on ball, throwing back to you now they're
[6736.60 - 6740.84] P:1985.43 E:0.286169 |  on the attack Italy, because De La Renzzo is coming down the right hand side, De La Renzzo's ball
[6740.84 - 6745.08] P:1951.70 E:0.284404 |  into the box, McGuire was there to clear it, Bellotti was putting him under pressure, might have
[6745.08 - 6751.16] P:1966.80 E:0.282012 |  fouled him, it's out of play, no it's it's only a throw in, a throw in, a Giorgio Gigno, he's got the
[6751.16 - 6757.40] P:1936.53 E:0.303082 |  ball at the moment, De La Renzzo is feeling the side of his hip, he's okay, yeah Jack Greelysh
[6757.40 - 6763.72] P:1936.29 E:0.297810 |  is coming on, he's lifting his feet and working off his tracksuit bottoms, Jack Greelysh about to enter
[6763.72 - 6771.32] P:1916.85 E:0.306839 |  the final, and I agree with you Chris I think it needs something like that and the one thing of
[6771.32 - 6776.28] P:1825.11 E:0.283595 |  course we know that he can do well one of the many things that we know he can do is get the ball
[6776.28 - 6784.44] P:1959.58 E:0.297157 |  downfield, carry the ball downfield, Italy though coming forward and Stone steps in, Bellotti hits
[6784.44 - 6789.00] P:2017.75 E:0.301693 |  the shot, it hits the back of McGuire which took the pace off it and advanced across the penalty
[6789.00 - 6796.52] P:1967.65 E:0.288201 |  area and Pickford sprinting to his right, got to the ball and actually is told just to calm it down
[6796.84 - 6802.92] P:1945.26 E:0.319109 |  overarms it out what a throw that was, goodness me I think he's been on his spinach, Jordan Pickford
[6802.92 - 6807.64] P:1861.77 E:0.293779 |  pulled it to the halfway line to Mount, Mount plays it in field but the referee says hang on
[6807.64 - 6813.56] P:1964.21 E:0.331404 |  we're going to have the substitution person it's Jack Greelysh coming on in the 99th minute
[6815.88 - 6822.12] P:1928.48 E:0.339267 |  just waiting to see who's going to be at Mason Mount who's left the pitch just down here so
[6823.00 - 6829.80] P:1937.60 E:0.299364 |  on comes the Aston Della captain in that extra time to see if he can make the difference and if he
[6829.80 - 6837.88] P:1961.39 E:0.317370 |  can this place will go absolutely mad, yeah we know the England squad got a good luck message
[6837.88 - 6845.96] P:1953.44 E:0.316389 |  off Tom Cruise and here's the Maverick, well if Tom Cruise is still here and there's no reason to
[6846.04 - 6852.44] P:1887.78 E:0.310403 |  suggest that he wouldn't be, maybe he'll see a little bit of Jack Greelysh in himself, a little
[6853.16 - 6859.24] P:1937.25 E:0.297536 |  twinkle in the eye perhaps, McGuire plays the ball down the left to Shaw, Greelysh makes a run
[6859.24 - 6863.80] P:1940.32 E:0.306314 |  into the box, Shaw with the cross, Paul Kealini wins that against Kane, Phillips now on the edge of
[6863.80 - 6868.84] P:1940.00 E:0.306323 |  the box that looked like a high challenge, Phillips went down to England men down, Phillips and Kane
[6868.84 - 6872.60] P:1959.39 E:0.304000 |  Shaw with the cross that took an afflection, took it out to the edge of the box, Bellotti hooked
[6872.60 - 6878.36] P:1955.05 E:0.313321 |  it away right foot at Aubrey's shoulder, don't get that one John I thought Phillips was fouled and
[6878.36 - 6882.92] P:1940.55 E:0.303384 |  there was little advantage for England who pushed out on the left hand side it would have been a
[6882.92 - 6889.64] P:1970.52 E:0.295106 |  good shooting position from a free kick, well the crowd I think have been revitalized by the arrival
[6889.64 - 6897.72] P:1958.74 E:0.273868 |  of the ever-popular Jack, Jackie Greelysh who they sing about, Paul comes back to England inside
[6897.72 - 6904.76] P:1942.33 E:0.304911 |  their own half, it's 1-1 if you've just joined the drama, back it goes to Jordan Pickford,
[6905.48 - 6910.84] P:1934.18 E:0.307594 |  you can hear our commentary by the way, the five-life commentary via the iPlayer synced up with the
[6910.84 - 6917.00] P:1944.67 E:0.323206 |  pictures, the matches on BBC One television as the ball is played forward and Bellotti has come
[6917.00 - 6925.32] P:2011.12 E:0.321100 |  back from an upside position, hasn't known about it to referee Kipers, but it is a free kick,
[6925.40 - 6930.52] P:1945.39 E:0.323915 |  Bjorn Kipers just holding his hand, he's a millionaire apparently Bjorn Kipers, supermarket
[6930.52 - 6936.52] P:1931.01 E:0.319191 |  millionaire the referee, doesn't need to do this, Shaw playing the ball down the left to Greelysh,
[6936.52 - 6941.24] P:1898.91 E:0.293329 |  Greelysh into the penalty area now defenders with him, Greelysh holding it up, drags it back,
[6941.24 - 6945.72] P:1982.95 E:0.298668 |  still the ball at his feet, still inside the area, a little flick for Saka but the touch from Saka
[6945.72 - 6951.56] P:1984.76 E:0.310195 |  was heavy and it bounces away through for a goal kick but that right there is Jack Greelysh giving
[6951.56 - 6959.16] P:1893.22 E:0.292569 |  the Italians something to think about, absolutely on the left hand side of the box takes the ball,
[6959.16 - 6965.96] P:1966.41 E:0.278654 |  dribbles the ball and the Italian defenders don't want to commit, little back heel to Saka, didn't
[6965.96 - 6971.24] P:1909.23 E:0.284111 |  quite come off but that's what Greelysh can give this England team, some invention, you can see the
[6971.24 - 6977.72] P:1960.35 E:0.306399 |  Italians a bit of fear there from their defenders, yeah, 1-1 remains the score, they're called pipped
[6978.44 - 6984.68] P:1947.38 E:0.320789 |  out on the far side and it's an England throw and the referee is just stopping play
[6985.80 - 6992.04] P:1827.60 E:0.317001 |  and in actual fact he says yes it is an Italian throw, this seems strange, so to throw into Italy
[6993.32 - 6998.28] P:1854.07 E:0.308218 |  Garasov get actually fielded the ball and threw it back for play Italy to take place throw,
[6999.08 - 7005.24] P:1982.35 E:0.333318 |  the boys and girls, the rice slip rangers are back on duty again tonight as they have been here
[7005.24 - 7009.56] P:1877.90 E:0.314014 |  at Wembley all the way through the tournament doing a fine fine job, great memories for them,
[7009.56 - 7017.08] P:1959.69 E:0.311477 |  what a night for them, could get better, it could get worse, Maguire sent the ball for it but under
[7017.08 - 7023.32] P:1945.42 E:0.317929 |  pressure just over hitting that and it just drips out of play half way inside the Italy half, so 1-1
[7023.32 - 7029.24] P:1866.33 E:0.289252 |  first period of extra time heading towards its conclusion, we have two minutes of it plus added
[7029.24 - 7035.96] P:1913.88 E:0.296595 |  time to go, England have studied themselves I would say in this first period of extra time Chris,
[7035.96 - 7041.24] P:1966.04 E:0.323712 |  yeah they have done, I just sensed a bit of frustration in the stadium and Harry Maguire looked up,
[7042.12 - 7047.24] P:2010.56 E:0.326201 |  wasn't a pass on nobody showing for the ball and just hooked the ball out of play that's twice
[7047.24 - 7051.96] P:1934.13 E:0.316832 |  he's done that now in this game, Italy played through the middle Bernadessi is under this,
[7051.96 - 7057.08] P:1933.68 E:0.313805 |  the ball out to the far side Walker slights in, gets it, all Walker's been beaten in the challenge,
[7057.08 - 7061.40] P:1999.86 E:0.308363 |  now here's the cross in the middle, Pickford with a save, it's driven Galwatt and it's right,
[7063.32 - 7070.44] P:1931.26 E:0.301338 |  it was hit Galwatt by Berardi in the end and it was jumped away, back downfield by the Italian
[7070.44 - 7077.96] P:1976.97 E:0.304668 |  player who was coming back onto the pitch, Kyle Walker goes to ground against Emerson and the
[7077.96 - 7082.20] P:1964.32 E:0.310586 |  ball's whipped and I tell you what, Pickford does really well, the ball's fisting across the six
[7082.20 - 7090.04] P:2047.33 E:0.334923 |  yard line, I think Bernadessi gets in front of Pickford, any sort of touch he scores,
[7090.60 - 7096.44] P:2054.59 E:0.322789 |  but Pickford I think it comes off his thigh and eventually the ball inspired why he did really
[7096.44 - 7103.56] P:2011.58 E:0.278509 |  well though Pickford, just threw himself at it from the low powerfully hit cross from Emerson
[7103.56 - 7108.60] P:1928.16 E:0.273303 |  on the left hand side, two Italians arriving on it and Pickford hit Bray, just gambled didn't he,
[7108.60 - 7113.64] P:1927.27 E:0.256156 |  gambled, brave goalkeeping, just took a chance threw himself at it and got the block on it,
[7113.64 - 7120.60] P:2000.33 E:0.272849 |  the important block to keep it at 1-1, Stungwell tonight, Pickford it has to be said again,
[7120.60 - 7124.60] P:1912.26 E:0.303384 |  there were questions about him after the Denmark game, Bellotti is claiming that Stones has
[7124.60 - 7131.48] P:1862.24 E:0.318053 |  fouled him off the ball, referee said a sowbat to John Stones, but Italy have got it inside their own
[7132.28 - 7135.96] P:1953.95 E:0.346765 |  half, we're in the last minute of the first period of extra time,
[7139.32 - 7145.00] P:1904.75 E:0.311879 |  Italy, long ball over the top towards the edge of the area, Harry Maguire wins that ahead of
[7145.00 - 7149.88] P:1946.92 E:0.292740 |  Lockele, comes down for Bernadessi, Lockele again edge of the area, shot is hit, block back to
[7149.88 - 7154.68] P:1970.83 E:0.301195 |  Lockele, England can't get it away in the D, they do now through Calvin Phillips who volleys it into
[7154.68 - 7160.52] P:1918.13 E:0.308310 |  the centre circle, Harry Kane is after this, Kane, Sakatryka hook it forward and now Kane slides
[7160.52 - 7168.20] P:1954.90 E:0.327678 |  in again, that is given as a free kick, Georginho on the wrong end of this one, free kick to Italy
[7168.20 - 7177.00] P:1877.19 E:0.286384 |  and Harry Kane, rather exasperated, Harry Kane has not had a chance in the final, the England captain,
[7177.00 - 7185.24] P:1924.41 E:0.311874 |  not had a chance to score yet, I think his link up play has excelled in the first half, but England
[7185.24 - 7191.96] P:1922.98 E:0.316474 |  have just been so deep in the second half, Italy have dominated, it's the same story in extra time.
[7194.12 - 7197.88] P:1883.78 E:0.315152 |  So one minute about of time, here's the curly head, Lockele under it on the right hand side,
[7197.88 - 7204.92] P:2003.82 E:0.310688 |  his cross is straight, Maguire who's able to adjust and then Grealish is shot over by Di Lorenzo,
[7205.64 - 7210.68] P:1928.04 E:0.305349 |  welcome to the game, Jack, I'll concede that free kick halfway inside your half.
[7210.68 - 7214.84] P:1923.40 E:0.293802 |  He does well though Grealish because he sees Di Lorenzo coming, it's a really daft challenge,
[7215.72 - 7224.68] P:1919.21 E:0.288049 |  Grealish halfway inside his own half has nowhere to go, wins the free kick, pressure off.
[7224.68 - 7232.84] P:1930.71 E:0.329147 |  Italy won, England won, 15 minutes of extra time to go once the whistle goes which it will do very
[7232.84 - 7239.64] P:1851.98 E:0.325716 |  shortly but not yet, as Pickford's long pass headed away, Henderson nods it out to the left hand side,
[7240.60 - 7245.40] P:1922.22 E:0.337366 |  Saka challenging for it, Shaw is there as well, Kane puts in the challenge, the bouncing ball,
[7245.40 - 7249.88] P:2001.57 E:0.333730 |  the referee says that came off an arm I think of Lockele, it was a bouncing ball, it was all
[7249.88 - 7254.76] P:1999.08 E:0.303121 |  quirk Kane and Lockele together and it's a free kick to England, set peace situation.
[7254.76 - 7260.92] P:1969.70 E:0.304091 |  Yep, Scott on the decision, the referee four or five yards away and this is a good position,
[7262.68 - 7269.08] P:1977.39 E:0.330016 |  15 yards out from the edge of the box on the left hand side, Luke Shaw over it,
[7269.64 - 7277.88] P:2017.66 E:0.336310 |  can he get the delivery spot on? Big moment this, chances for England have been few and very far
[7277.88 - 7286.92] P:2063.80 E:0.341619 |  between, Luke Shaw, we need to see that delivery that he produced in Rome against Ukraine, Shaw
[7286.92 - 7292.60] P:2008.96 E:0.329719 |  standing, this is 15 yards in from the left touch line, so it's a good position to deliver
[7292.60 - 7299.08] P:1996.53 E:0.314402 |  from the angle, Shaw lifts it high, two Italians end up on the turf and the ball is headed onto the
[7299.08 - 7304.60] P:1940.39 E:0.304273 |  roof of the net from the far side by Jordan Henderson but the whistle had long gone for the free kick,
[7304.60 - 7310.76] P:1936.06 E:0.276120 |  Italians all over the turf, the whistle goes and off the all walk towards the halfway line
[7310.76 - 7315.16] P:1927.18 E:0.289073 |  with the score, half time and extra time, Italy won, England won.
[7318.28 - 7328.12] P:1971.55 E:0.327201 |  So stay tuned, players are ready to start the second half, Rashford is not coming on quite
[7329.08 - 7334.60] P:1876.31 E:0.324220 |  yet Chris Sutton, what are you thinking? Well I'm thinking that England are on the road, some of it
[7334.60 - 7340.84] P:1959.51 E:0.338783 |  with Micah on this, I think if I'm an England manager I'll take penalties but we've seen England
[7341.40 - 7345.40] P:1965.25 E:0.311394 |  dig deep under Garrett Southgate before and maybe they can snatch something
[7346.60 - 7352.92] P:1984.45 E:0.331964 |  on a counter attack and have players who've been hurt at Italy but Italy have been so so dominant
[7353.48 - 7358.76] P:1935.77 E:0.307063 |  since half time in normal time. And Italy now playing from right to left in the second half,
[7358.76 - 7365.24] P:1967.77 E:0.344531 |  the blue shirts with the gold numbers, and Stingland all in white, Rashford still with his training
[7365.24 - 7372.76] P:1928.48 E:0.321716 |  top on, oh and Stones puts in the challenge on Bellotti who was looking to turn it and rather
[7372.76 - 7379.80] P:1937.20 E:0.299045 |  dived in and it's a free kick and it's a yellow card, he was looking to turn and it was Maguire who
[7379.80 - 7388.92] P:1924.61 E:0.289608 |  came in with the challenge actually and Harry Maguire is shown the yellow card for that foul
[7388.92 - 7399.40] P:1895.44 E:0.325514 |  from behind on the Italian number nine and the free kick in a central position, best part of 30 yards out
[7401.40 - 7408.04] P:1888.36 E:0.318339 |  so the players milling around on the edge of the penalty area, Georgino is there, Bernadeschi is there,
[7408.12 - 7415.80] P:1908.02 E:0.320588 |  Bernadeschi looks as though he'll be the man to take it, Bernadeschi, it's a similar range from Denmark,
[7416.44 - 7426.20] P:1942.30 E:0.335909 |  sports from, it is similar range, maybe Damsegaard was a little to the right, but it is similar range
[7426.20 - 7433.16] P:1977.42 E:0.332024 |  so Jordan Pickford standing on his line, hands on the top of his hips, three-nine England wall in the
[7434.12 - 7440.04] P:2001.63 E:0.351089 |  penalty, Bernadeschi waits, it's going to be a left-footed free kick, steps up now, Pitcher,
[7440.04 - 7444.52] P:2039.65 E:0.318099 |  Law and it's straight up Pickford who juggles it but then gathers it at the second attempt
[7444.52 - 7452.36] P:2007.50 E:0.310187 |  as Georgino arrives just too late for Italy, they're footed around the wall straight up,
[7452.36 - 7459.48] P:1963.43 E:0.271374 |  Pickford who fumbles, Georgino nearly got there, Pickford gathered at the second attempt,
[7460.44 - 7466.28] P:2004.09 E:0.306696 |  Kialini looks a bit stiff here, crikey, ball downfield, bounced off,
[7466.28 - 7471.72] P:1986.57 E:0.323073 |  bounced off sterling onto Kialini off the pitch and Kialini there, now he did look,
[7472.60 - 7477.80] P:2021.19 E:0.308232 |  he did look like a veteran, however it's out and it's a throw in, throw into England,
[7477.80 - 7486.68] P:1980.93 E:0.284678 |  second period of expert time, 13 minutes away from Penultis, Walker, stands with a ball spinning
[7486.68 - 7491.96] P:1966.35 E:0.300692 |  in his hand and then it becomes, pearls it in, McGuire's after this, clicked across the box,
[7491.96 - 7496.12] P:1986.02 E:0.304943 |  really smooth the shot but that's what my De Lorenzo comes out to Saka on the edge of the penalty
[7496.12 - 7501.32] P:2020.66 E:0.311662 |  area, Saka leaves it to Kane, Kane dinks it back in, diving it out, oh no the goalkeeper,
[7501.32 - 7507.88] P:1995.57 E:0.295048 |  Donoroma just got there ahead of Stones who threw himself at it, he was diving forward,
[7507.88 - 7512.68] P:1980.94 E:0.321388 |  Donoroma was diving out and the goalkeeper got the touch to it, England continued to press,
[7512.68 - 7517.24] P:1944.72 E:0.325047 |  Saka it runs away from him and then it's cleared away by Benucci on the edge of the area,
[7517.24 - 7522.60] P:2035.20 E:0.332607 |  this has gone up to the halfway line, Italy break forward, Locatelli looking for Bellotti,
[7522.60 - 7526.36] P:1998.46 E:0.330160 |  he gives it to Bellotti, left side of the box, Bellotti across to the back,
[7526.36 - 7535.72] P:1912.06 E:0.323238 |  Poshore is there for England and the offside flag is up, well that's an exciting period of end to
[7535.80 - 7542.68] P:1884.98 E:0.301174 |  end play that we've had in the entire 109 minutes, what a 60 seconds we've just had,
[7542.68 - 7548.28] P:1929.84 E:0.299968 |  first of all the cross goes in, really gets a shot in, De Lorenzo brilliant block, ball goes out
[7548.28 - 7554.20] P:1880.41 E:0.284648 |  to Harry Kane, edge of the box, he hooks across him right footed and in swing, Donoroma comes flying
[7554.20 - 7560.12] P:1851.57 E:0.274652 |  out, gets a hand to it and then it's Italy breaking out offside eventually, the lucho
[7561.08 - 7568.12] P:1908.34 E:0.299674 |  no the clearance there, it's okay Shaw, here's the radio five live, Italy one, England one,
[7568.12 - 7573.16] P:1728.63 E:0.308781 |  the World Service are with us, all the local radio stations around, England from Coneboat,
[7573.16 - 7579.40] P:1961.59 E:0.315712 |  the Kent from the Norfolk Broads to the Lake District and up to the very top of Northumberland
[7579.40 - 7587.80] P:2002.44 E:0.329640 |  as well, listening in to Italy one, England one, Rachel Burton's at the National Football Museum
[7587.80 - 7593.64] P:1904.48 E:0.324508 |  had breakfast on five live in this morning, in the morning, will she have anyone to talk to or not,
[7594.68 - 7601.40] P:1936.90 E:0.315372 |  Panelde's on the way, Gareth Southgate waiting on the side of the pitch 25 years ago
[7602.60 - 7607.64] P:1877.73 E:0.303416 |  and the Gareth Southgate, his England team, it all ended on Panelde's here at Wembley,
[7607.64 - 7613.40] P:1904.02 E:0.304503 |  Euro 96, have to confess I've always had a bit of a feeling that Panelde's would come into this
[7613.40 - 7619.88] P:1931.67 E:0.326893 |  somewhere for Southgate's England, Harry Maguire now centre of the field, taking the ball out
[7619.88 - 7624.92] P:1958.63 E:0.306348 |  towards the left-hand side, the Shaw, Shaw forward to Saka, Saka plays it back to Maguire,
[7624.92 - 7628.52] P:1978.57 E:0.326798 |  needed to be quick there but the touch is good from the Manchester United captain,
[7629.88 - 7634.68] P:1942.55 E:0.325034 |  Stones, shapes the pass to Henderson now on the right, Walker arriving, Italian
[7634.68 - 7639.32] P:1940.32 E:0.306131 |  shirts getting back into position, Henderson, Henderson plays it all the way back towards the
[7639.40 - 7648.20] P:2017.77 E:0.328439 |  halfway line, still one-one, 110 minutes appears on the clock, Walker, square from him, the Calvin
[7648.20 - 7655.72] P:2040.78 E:0.328213 |  Phillips, Bellotti forces Phillips to turn away, turn back towards the halfway line, Maguire,
[7655.72 - 7661.88] P:2012.13 E:0.336605 |  to Shaw on the left-hand side, England are just playing in front of Italy at the moment, here it
[7661.88 - 7667.88] P:2009.14 E:0.316877 |  is up with Grealish, expectancy rises, Grealish goes on a run out towards the right-hand side,
[7667.88 - 7672.76] P:2006.28 E:0.317645 |  across the edge of the box, Sterling, to Henderson, back to Sterling in the box, Sterling gets away,
[7672.76 - 7678.04] P:1953.80 E:0.301653 |  the challenge comes in on him, excellent recovery from Chiellini, outstanding Chiellini,
[7678.60 - 7684.36] P:1962.82 E:0.329076 |  and Italy are able to clear and Stones heads it down and England threatening here that they might
[7684.36 - 7691.08] P:1994.94 E:0.337657 |  finish strongly, 10 minutes to go, brilliant defending from Chiellini, 1v1 Sterling, looks
[7691.08 - 7696.92] P:1968.93 E:0.334156 |  like he's gone past him but big left boot from Chiellini, Grealish again, Grealish pass Bernadaschi,
[7697.00 - 7700.76] P:2024.60 E:0.328212 |  Grealish still going, cutting in field, plays the ball out towards the left-hand side,
[7700.76 - 7705.32] P:2011.94 E:0.327145 |  Shaw is on to this against Di Lorenzo and then Shaw's ball back doesn't find Satter,
[7705.32 - 7709.56] P:1926.48 E:0.335993 |  and Italy are able to clear it away down field and suddenly England are revitalised.
[7714.04 - 7721.32] P:1965.37 E:0.320755 |  On they come again, Stones to Sterling, what a wonderful ball that was from Henderson by the
[7721.40 - 7727.40] P:1948.89 E:0.307447 |  way through the Sterling when Chiellini put in the challenge, ball out to the far side from Henderson,
[7727.40 - 7732.52] P:1949.22 E:0.334256 |  this is hooked away for Italy and the ball just bounces harmlessly near the halfway line,
[7733.88 - 7742.44] P:1943.88 E:0.313209 |  the crowd, this crowd of over 67,000 have waited for a long time in this match for England to come
[7742.44 - 7751.16] P:1948.27 E:0.321619 |  again but here deep in extra time England are threatening to do that, Phillips, McGuire, now
[7751.16 - 7760.60] P:1915.02 E:0.338146 |  it is Shaw on the left, Sacker and the crowd want to see Grealish get the ball, simple as that,
[7761.80 - 7767.72] P:1918.76 E:0.338844 |  Stones now out here to the right-hand side for Walker, Walker just passes it through to Henderson,
[7768.28 - 7774.28] P:1917.41 E:0.318328 |  has a look in field, Harry Kane is available there, Kane now through towards Sterling, Sterling
[7774.28 - 7778.52] P:1937.61 E:0.342983 |  in comes the challenge on him, Grealish slides into it, the ball comes away, Grealish is caught,
[7779.08 - 7784.12] P:1921.88 E:0.326393 |  the reaction there was quite dramatic from Jack Grealish, the two players arrived at the same time
[7784.68 - 7789.96] P:1870.11 E:0.313788 |  and Grealish has spun onto his left, Chiellini is unhappy with that, the challenge from Grealish,
[7789.96 - 7794.92] P:1820.41 E:0.298529 |  Chiellini saying his little bit about this, Callum and Phillips is in there as well,
[7795.00 - 7800.68] P:1839.52 E:0.289016 |  there's an Italian player down, the two of them coming together at the same time and Grealish
[7801.32 - 7809.80] P:1855.57 E:0.306544 |  is still on his side, he's lying on his left side, two players sort of spun in together for a 50-50
[7809.80 - 7819.16] P:1874.56 E:0.320978 |  ball, there is a yellow card in the hand of referee Kipers, it's Giorginho, Giorginho came in,
[7819.80 - 7827.88] P:1892.71 E:0.308619 |  Giorginho stepped on the ball and then stepped all across, Jack Grealish's right thigh is groin
[7827.88 - 7834.52] P:1842.96 E:0.300775 |  and his left thigh, well I think Giorginho gets a bit of the ball but it's the follow-through,
[7835.08 - 7840.84] P:1856.00 E:0.287735 |  isn't it and Jack Grealish sitting up now, I think that's a scandalous challenge, I do
[7841.72 - 7848.20] P:1891.35 E:0.293173 |  truly believe he asked have a look at that, absolutely I think Giorginho, I think could have
[7848.20 - 7852.76] P:1831.40 E:0.320146 |  seen red there, I think Grealish will be okay because it was all on the meaty parts of it,
[7852.76 - 7857.48] P:1914.14 E:0.339775 |  all the way he did he caught them on the knee as well actually, just seen another angle now,
[7857.48 - 7862.44] P:1909.72 E:0.335683 |  he'll say he got the ball first but I'll tell you what I think there's a red jump,
[7864.60 - 7869.24] P:1858.50 E:0.317648 |  well we've not seen on the screen a suggestion that that's going to be a R and the yellow card
[7869.24 - 7874.84] P:1830.43 E:0.306130 |  is out, Jack Grealish is up please to say, Giorginho is still there as well, yellow card is shown,
[7875.72 - 7880.52] P:1876.83 E:0.288862 |  let's go down to Karen, I think that's reckless, completely reckless and you can tell by the
[7880.52 - 7885.08] P:1885.11 E:0.290292 |  play especially Jack Grealish, we know he gets fouls a lot especially in the Premier League but
[7885.08 - 7889.72] P:1765.22 E:0.288267 |  the way he reacted how he went down, I knew that was bad, the stadium knew that was bad,
[7889.72 - 7897.08] P:1880.03 E:0.299807 |  that was a shocking challenge from Giorginho and I'd be fuming and I am fuming, Grealish is okay,
[7897.08 - 7903.08] P:1899.71 E:0.293097 |  that's the main thing but that's certainly a talking point and as far as I can tell and listen
[7903.08 - 7909.00] P:1890.13 E:0.309748 |  the communication about the AR has not been absolutely outstanding during the tournament
[7909.00 - 7917.72] P:1946.22 E:0.321108 |  even though the system itself has worked rather better, Giorginho is clever there though because
[7917.72 - 7925.00] P:1946.18 E:0.296560 |  he goes down as well like he's injured, free kick to England up, six minutes to go, Phillips curls
[7925.00 - 7931.08] P:1999.17 E:0.307027 |  it in high, Donnarumma comes and makes the catch high above Maguire and he actually might have
[7931.08 - 7936.36] P:1973.41 E:0.339876 |  caught his own man, I think it's Di Lorenzo and then the booze because Giorginho comes back onto the
[7936.36 - 7945.96] P:1975.70 E:0.298790 |  field and Italy are back up to the full complement, Paul from Calvin Phillips too close to the big
[7946.04 - 7955.56] P:1978.81 E:0.304880 |  Italian keeper, he pucks it out of the sky, Italy won, England won, 6-0-6 will follow after the end
[7955.56 - 7961.96] P:1938.72 E:0.326134 |  of the final however long it takes in the presentation and once we've chewed it all over it'll be
[7961.96 - 7967.40] P:1897.11 E:0.312606 |  Chris, Chris Sutton along with Alistair Bruce Ball and special guest Terry Butcher, the former
[7967.40 - 7972.20] P:1930.62 E:0.313375 |  England captain who'll be sitting on the edge of his seat I'm sure Terry watching this one,
[7973.16 - 7985.72] P:1950.64 E:0.329967 |  Italy won, England won and it's a Parucci and Chiellini together, less than five minutes to go,
[7987.40 - 7994.76] P:1943.58 E:0.320888 |  penalties await, it had to be, didn't it? Garas Southgate standing coolly on the far side of the
[7994.76 - 8002.76] P:1913.93 E:0.314895 |  pitch with his hands in his pockets, he's taken off the mac, the wet evening has dried up and it
[8002.76 - 8008.28] P:1853.16 E:0.327695 |  might be penalty kicks, Emerson though plays it into the penalty area, Bernadette with a shot on
[8008.28 - 8014.44] P:1952.19 E:0.318246 |  the turn he's saying that it came off the arm of Stones, referee Kipers though was was less than
[8014.44 - 8020.52] P:1901.97 E:0.296406 |  10 yards away and immediately ruled out that that might be a penalty off the body of Stones,
[8020.52 - 8027.00] P:1914.70 E:0.316722 |  yeah not to sure hit him on the arm but that was a very close range as well that would have been
[8027.00 - 8033.64] P:1937.98 E:0.332000 |  extremely harsh, great appeal law from Bernadette, the Italians are good at that,
[8035.40 - 8041.72] P:1895.42 E:0.326124 |  Pigford I think we are going to see Rashford and Sancho coming on that has to be with penalties
[8041.72 - 8047.80] P:1933.65 E:0.311621 |  in mind to penalty takers, now here always Saka on the left hand side Saka takes it to the
[8048.04 - 8053.16] P:1907.73 E:0.317768 |  byline and Grealish is in there as well, the ball bounces away off Grealish behind
[8053.16 - 8060.36] P:1936.80 E:0.307158 |  goal kick says referee Kipers very calmly and in England still have three more changes they
[8060.36 - 8064.92] P:1967.93 E:0.280548 |  could make actually but it's going to be an Italian change first and it's going to be
[8066.60 - 8073.08] P:1963.62 E:0.292736 |  Florenzi the right back, the right back who's been a Paris Saint-Germain this season,
[8073.80 - 8078.20] P:1962.89 E:0.309126 |  Alessandro Florenzi who will take the place of Emerson
[8083.24 - 8087.48] P:1850.83 E:0.343418 |  and then England I think are also going to make their two changes now as well
[8089.56 - 8096.44] P:1868.93 E:0.343311 |  so the booze as the Italian change is made so who's going to make way for England, we are only
[8096.44 - 8101.64] P:1938.42 E:0.275161 |  two and a half minutes away from penalties Rashford and Sancho not coming on just yet
[8102.60 - 8109.16] P:1867.16 E:0.295396 |  and Florenzi has actually come across to play at left back so Di Lorenzo stays at right back
[8109.16 - 8119.16] P:1936.09 E:0.317150 |  Florenzi at left back, throw in for England half inside their own half as in as at this stage of
[8119.16 - 8127.88] P:1994.10 E:0.325871 |  extra time the goal now would probably win it whoever gets it would be European champions
[8127.88 - 8133.64] P:1944.85 E:0.308769 |  falls out of play on the on the far side, still though bored up for the subs and they're all
[8133.64 - 8138.20] P:1953.20 E:0.314887 |  stripped and ready to go, yeah fourth official's lurking as though he's ready with the numbers but
[8138.20 - 8147.88] P:1969.30 E:0.323122 |  I think England have said no not yet not yet we're in the 119th minute of this Euro 2020 final
[8148.60 - 8153.64] P:1906.88 E:0.311581 |  underneath the the turquoise arch of Wembley Stadium
[8154.36 - 8157.16] P:1840.11 E:0.334408 |  but for England they've got to hope the Italians don't keep the ball now
[8158.04 - 8162.12] P:1999.24 E:0.320509 |  another minute and a half, yes that's a very good point
[8164.68 - 8171.32] P:1945.85 E:0.321903 |  Florenzi plays it in field here is Giorginio Giorginio back to Benucci
[8172.04 - 8180.60] P:1959.14 E:0.348817 |  and then forward from Cristanki now Florenzi down the left wing Florenzi's cross comes off
[8180.60 - 8187.24] P:1919.15 E:0.333603 |  Jordan Henderson and spins behind it's an Italian corner but are England going to make the change
[8187.24 - 8197.40] P:1940.24 E:0.326526 |  now yes they are and it's Jordan Henderson who's coming off for Marcus Rashford so Jordan Henderson
[8197.40 - 8203.24] P:1898.73 E:0.315410 |  as a substitute is going to be substituted remember he missed the penalty in the warm-up match
[8203.24 - 8207.72] P:1911.35 E:0.301458 |  of Middlesbrough when he made his return from injury so perhaps there's sense there he missed the
[8207.72 - 8213.16] P:1894.03 E:0.302878 |  penalty in the uh in the columbia match at the World Cup as well in the shootout there so off comes
[8213.16 - 8222.04] P:1930.37 E:0.316851 |  Jordan Henderson on comes Marcus Rashford finally into the action he's just been a fringe figure
[8222.04 - 8230.92] P:1991.53 E:0.285539 |  for England at this tournament and the other change sees Kyle Walker off for Jaden Sancia
[8230.92 - 8239.64] P:1834.69 E:0.307800 |  interesting how England shape up now for the remaining seconds well it's a corner big moment this
[8240.92 - 8247.08] P:1915.24 E:0.301244 |  Bernadeschi to take the corner for Italy England must defend this it didn't least
[8247.64 - 8252.84] P:1893.07 E:0.287589 |  they're the champions and it comes a glance across the penalty area and it's beaten everyone in there
[8253.72 - 8257.72] P:1880.49 E:0.304119 |  Kealini ended up on the ground on his knees at the far post Italy continued to press
[8257.72 - 8261.48] P:1977.34 E:0.304043 |  Grealish with a challenge controlled at the near post by Fennix and then left footed
[8261.48 - 8269.72] P:1924.04 E:0.319701 |  followed away downfield I make it the 120 minutes up we are second away from penalties in fact there
[8269.72 - 8275.72] P:1981.40 E:0.300842 |  are three minutes of additional time three minutes of time added on England
[8277.80 - 8284.52] P:1898.04 E:0.298569 |  stand off Italy uh Dilarenzi Dilarenzo then goes down under pressure from Saka and it's Marcus
[8284.52 - 8291.64] P:1933.74 E:0.265679 |  Rashford at right back John how many times has he played there in his career? Disappointingly Chris I
[8291.64 - 8298.44] P:1903.07 E:0.291011 |  have to say I don't know that but I know what I guess is the answer so they are running out Rashford
[8299.40 - 8302.60] P:1961.63 E:0.311986 |  and it's Bernadeschi Rashford in with a challenge well done Rashford
[8303.96 - 8307.56] P:1930.73 E:0.317325 |  not the most cultured challenge I think I've ever seen by a right back in my time
[8308.36 - 8312.20] P:1947.38 E:0.312562 |  but he got enough on the ball and he actually played it off Bernadeschi and out for a throw into
[8312.20 - 8317.32] P:1942.32 E:0.280400 |  England maybe a future maybe a future for him. He's defending like that yeah yeah
[8319.16 - 8325.00] P:1983.61 E:0.340095 |  stones for the throw and he leads it just bounces into the ground for Rashford to take
[8325.64 - 8330.68] P:2007.98 E:0.327085 |  and everyone here and everyone around the country I reckon they'll be close on 30 million people
[8330.68 - 8336.52] P:1912.60 E:0.289289 |  watching in this country on television tonight we're going to have a penalty shoot out it would seem
[8337.32 - 8343.80] P:1946.38 E:0.308869 |  Sancho Jadon Sancho loses it on the halfway line Giorgio Gigno plays it through now it is
[8344.68 - 8353.40] P:1957.48 E:0.303634 |  centrally for Italy with Locchatelli Chiellini is calling for it on the left wing instead it goes
[8353.48 - 8359.96] P:2002.93 E:0.321145 |  to Florenzi Chiellini on the overlap he didn't use him he went back in sight towards Giorgio
[8360.84 - 8366.68] P:1981.25 E:0.315785 |  Square now De Lorenzo has joined the attack Italy might have one last chance here one last chance
[8366.68 - 8371.32] P:1987.76 E:0.324270 |  to win it and break English hearts the balls swing into the England penalty area but beyond the
[8371.32 - 8377.72] P:1970.54 E:0.300244 |  bar post between Pickford and right back Rashford who allows it to go through for a goal kick and
[8377.72 - 8384.52] P:1886.09 E:0.308500 |  I'll make it we have 40 seconds to play Chris Sutton yeah dangerous ball in from the right hand
[8384.52 - 8391.80] P:1873.44 E:0.312563 |  side fizzed in left footed all the Italian forwards on the heels I just wonder though John whether
[8391.80 - 8396.92] P:1893.77 E:0.324411 |  the Italians will feel they've done enough to to win this game second half performance
[8396.92 - 8404.76] P:1938.37 E:0.333157 |  have been the dominant side in extra time I can actually see the the pulp who's standing in the

[8409.88 - 8415.80] P:1986.69 E:0.337114 |  Italy have got the pulp on their side inside the ground and penalties come that's a worry
[8416.44 - 8425.00] P:1984.35 E:0.276315 |  a throwing for England down the right seconds to go seconds to go now England in some ways

[8447.16 - 8454.20] P:1907.56 E:0.263892 |  heartened with a stat John which I've been sent from little Bruce Ball that no team has ever won
[8454.20 - 8461.72] P:1897.96 E:0.268021 |  two penalty shootouts at the same European championship Italy have already won one Italy
[8461.72 - 8467.56] P:1772.36 E:0.314573 |  won one in the last round they've only been three penalty shootouts at Euro 2020 before this
[8468.20 - 8478.28] P:1811.15 E:0.304408 |  and in them France lost to Switzerland who lost to Spain who lost to Italy who are now about to play England
[8484.52 - 8488.52] P:1951.19 E:0.328809 |  well I feel that this has been a story that is there to be written
[8489.24 - 8495.40] P:2022.11 E:0.325419 |  after Garas Southgate's experience 25 years ago missing the crucial penalty in the semifinal
[8495.40 - 8501.72] P:1989.09 E:0.333046 |  for England and now he's the manager and it's gone down to a penalty shootout in the final
[8503.00 - 8509.00] P:2019.18 E:0.350263 |  to decide if England can win a trophy for the first time since 1966 Italy to go first
[8509.80 - 8511.16] P:2054.55 E:0.340970 |  Domenico Berardi
[8511.64 - 8521.08] P:2033.71 E:0.313580 |  a left-footed penalty against Jordan Pickford who is sent the wrong way and Berardi gets Italy off
[8521.72 - 8527.88] P:2028.73 E:0.315550 |  to a scoring start in the shootout 1-0 yeah cool as you like from Berardi left footed
[8528.92 - 8536.84] P:2031.35 E:0.288943 |  Pickford dives to his left hand side Berardi sends him the wrong way and here comes England captain
[8537.56 - 8541.96] P:2051.97 E:0.312798 |  so it's Harry Kane who missed the penalty in the semifinal in extra time
[8543.32 - 8548.68] P:2042.89 E:0.310876 |  Harry Kane who scored England's first penalty in the shootout at the World Cup in the last 16
[8549.24 - 8552.28] P:2067.74 E:0.338125 |  when England had never before when a penalty shootout at a World Cup
[8553.24 - 8560.04] P:2058.19 E:0.319502 |  Harry Kane four five steps back Donnarumma on the line Kane comes up and oh he beats him
[8560.60 - 8566.12] P:1988.08 E:0.314331 |  and scores Donnarumma went the right way but Kane put enough on it and it's 1-1
[8566.12 - 8572.52] P:1979.71 E:0.311014 |  now boy did he mean that Harry Kane real conviction whipped it across Donnarumma
[8572.52 - 8575.48] P:2028.70 E:0.324544 |  Garas Southgate little fist pump there
[8579.00 - 8589.64] P:2071.12 E:0.336554 |  next for Italy it is Andrea Bellotti who came on as a substitute Bellotti who was not scored
[8589.72 - 8596.52] P:2039.39 E:0.340836 |  at the tournament places the ball on the spot one big stride back and then three four five
[8596.52 - 8601.88] P:2018.09 E:0.340445 |  standing in the deep Jordan Pickford comes off the line Pickford jumping up and down
[8601.88 - 8609.16] P:2027.35 E:0.329669 |  tripping the crossbar still jumping Bellotti waits penalty shootout to decide the final of Euro 2020
[8610.04 - 8614.04] P:2091.03 E:0.343403 |  here comes Bellotti and Pickford saves down to his left
[8619.80 - 8626.76] P:1974.81 E:0.325398 |  oh the cheers advantage England in the shootout he reads it brilliantly Jordan Pickford
[8626.76 - 8630.04] P:1959.68 E:0.303603 |  it's not a good penalty Pickford gambles through his left hand side
[8632.12 - 8636.84] P:1956.72 E:0.322208 |  not the direction not the pace from Bellotti England have the advantage
[8639.16 - 8645.24] P:1982.81 E:0.317030 |  Harry Maguire who scored the first penalty when England were involved in the shootout in
[8645.24 - 8651.88] P:1990.45 E:0.327902 |  Gimmarine in the nation's league back in 2019 so it's Harry Maguire
[8653.80 - 8661.80] P:1991.81 E:0.319901 |  to shoot England ahead in the shootout Donnarumma on the line he looks so big Maguire comes up
[8661.80 - 8668.12] P:2036.42 E:0.333518 |  on puts his foot through it and rattles it into the top of the net and the ball bounces back to him
[8668.12 - 8675.48] P:2013.61 E:0.329749 |  and he picks it up and he jumps and gives a fist bump to the crowd it's 2-1 England in the shootout
[8675.48 - 8683.88] P:1972.43 E:0.335763 |  have some of that Italy Maguire laces there I mean that goes into the top corner the roof of the net
[8683.88 - 8689.00] P:2010.94 E:0.331034 |  that's a stunning penalty three Donnarummas wouldn't have saved that
[8691.88 - 8701.24] P:2002.54 E:0.326338 |  it's Bonucci next the man who scored the goal to equalize now he is a regular Italian penalty taker
[8702.84 - 8712.12] P:2028.18 E:0.347748 |  scored in the Euro 26 quarterfinal against Germany so it's Bonucci but Italy now a little
[8712.12 - 8716.84] P:2001.05 E:0.305185 |  stop and then a very good penalty high above Pickford who went the right way but it's in
[8717.48 - 8722.92] P:2004.91 E:0.324594 |  and it's back at 2-2 and a clenched fist from Bonucci to his team mate standing in the line on the
[8722.92 - 8731.48] P:2017.84 E:0.331029 |  halfway brush your penalty Stutters Stotters has a look at Jordan Pickford and then he whips it to
[8731.48 - 8740.68] P:1996.68 E:0.313189 |  Pickford's right hand side into the top corner so Pickford has already saved from Bellotti
[8740.68 - 8746.04] P:1981.70 E:0.317313 |  Donnarumma has been beaten twice and then the Donnarumma saved from Marata crucially and the
[8746.04 - 8752.28] P:1962.67 E:0.319234 |  penalty shootout here on Tuesday it's Marcus Rashford Marcus Rashford scored three out of three
[8752.28 - 8758.28] P:1973.43 E:0.309896 |  penalties for England in his time scored in Moscow in the World Cup shootout he's only just come
[8758.28 - 8764.44] P:2020.42 E:0.300923 |  on to the field here though laid on in the extra time so it's Marcus Rashford who steps out towards
[8764.44 - 8771.88] P:2013.38 E:0.311583 |  the left a little stutter and then all hits the post and misses Donnarumma went the wrong way
[8772.76 - 8775.96] P:1996.64 E:0.313878 |  but Rashford went for placement and hit the post
[8778.12 - 8785.48] P:1970.10 E:0.327628 |  and it remains 2-2 took a long time didn't need to take that Marcus Rashford
[8786.68 - 8794.76] P:1972.81 E:0.338925 |  slow run up looks at Donnarumma sends in the wrong way but then hits the post agonising for England
[8794.76 - 8803.08] P:2007.59 E:0.345016 |  so it's all square at 2-2 after three penalty each
[8805.32 - 8811.64] P:2031.87 E:0.342316 |  it's Bernadeschi now the Italian number 20 with the guide one tear Jordan Pickford
[8812.28 - 8819.72] P:2061.70 E:0.336577 |  on the line again clapping his hands all animation Bernadeschi left footer to send it down the middle
[8819.72 - 8825.88] P:2053.44 E:0.306897 |  Pickford left to his right with the ball in the back of the net and Italy now 3-2 up
[8828.28 - 8833.96] P:2000.94 E:0.312719 |  good penalty Bernadeschi goes down the middle Pickford goes early throws himself to his right
[8833.96 - 8841.08] P:2011.97 E:0.302381 |  hand side advantage Italy so now it's the other substitute who is brought on with penalties
[8841.08 - 8847.56] P:2034.71 E:0.330396 |  in mind Jaden Sancho who I would guess in the next few days will complete his big money move to
[8847.56 - 8855.00] P:2044.24 E:0.326043 |  Manchester United it's just been a peripheral figure at the European Championship and now Jaden Sancho
[8858.44 - 8866.36] P:2017.36 E:0.321746 |  this to make it 3-3 Jaden Sancho comes up a little delay and it's saved by Donnarumma down to his left
[8867.32 - 8873.80] P:2040.07 E:0.329813 |  Sancho misses it remains 3-2 Italy
[8876.60 - 8885.08] P:1976.34 E:0.305481 |  and if they score the next penalty Italy are the European champions and England will lose in the final
[8885.72 - 8892.76] P:1978.34 E:0.305097 |  the irony is it's the the two subs the specialist penalty takers who have both missed
[8893.48 - 8898.92] P:1991.36 E:0.300587 |  Sancho telegraphs that Donnarumma down to his left hand side comfortable save and Giorgino
[8899.48 - 8905.80] P:1956.55 E:0.305242 |  could have possibly been sent off jump could have been sent off that will be the talk after the game
[8907.16 - 8913.72] P:2011.88 E:0.314360 |  but it is Giorgino who scored past Jordan Pickford just a few months ago the Chelsea
[8913.72 - 8921.32] P:1996.79 E:0.315256 |  against Everton in the Premier League Pickford must save this if Giorgino scores
[8922.76 - 8928.12] P:1963.26 E:0.333301 |  Italy win and Garret Southgate England will lose in the final on a penalty shootout
[8929.16 - 8936.44] P:2072.55 E:0.332956 |  so Giorgino now sets up and there's the little delay and Pickford saved it oh my goodness down to
[8936.44 - 8945.80] P:2054.86 E:0.339492 |  his right got his hands I think he pushed it onto the post oh oh have you ever
[8945.96 - 8948.84] P:2049.64 E:0.322951 |  so
[8950.76 - 8953.72] P:2007.35 E:0.340695 |  three two to Italy
[8956.36 - 8963.08] P:2016.69 E:0.323538 |  so Bucchio Saca now the 19 year old has to score this
[8967.80 - 8971.96] P:1977.18 E:0.334356 |  has to score this to keep it going to take it to Soutenda
[8972.92 - 8978.92] P:2003.91 E:0.330307 |  Saca is already waiting it's not a long run up it's a left-footed penalty here he comes
[8978.92 - 8985.88] P:2034.30 E:0.326988 |  I saved it Donnarumma saves England miss three consecutive penalties in the shootout
[8985.88 - 8992.92] P:1922.65 E:0.312313 |  it's poor Bucchio Saca who misses the crucial one but Donnarumma almost unbeatable there
[8993.48 - 9000.76] P:1808.40 E:0.326477 |  and Italy win it Italy win the penalty shootout they're European champions again for the first
[9000.76 - 9009.16] P:1890.65 E:0.311397 |  time since the 60s and England Garret Southgate England losing a penalty shootout in the final
[9010.36 - 9014.04] P:1905.67 E:0.330503 |  what a twist what a terrible twist for England
[9018.36 - 9026.76] P:1827.14 E:0.317699 |  and the Italian players all scream downfield and pile on one another in front of the stand
[9027.72 - 9033.56] P:1781.49 E:0.316131 |  and the England players they call Garret Southgate has gone straight across Garret Southgate is there
[9033.56 - 9041.88] P:1826.87 E:0.307113 |  now with Bucchio Saca who is inconsolable and Garret Southgate this this feels like this feels like
[9043.64 - 9050.36] P:1789.01 E:0.320990 |  the age is all coming together as the man who missed the penalty for England 25 years ago knows
[9050.36 - 9057.72] P:1763.83 E:0.307476 |  exactly how Bucchio Saca will feel and he is there the England manager and and now the rest of the
[9057.72 - 9065.48] P:1724.65 E:0.318917 |  England players join as well and Garret Southgate moves away but that's it Italy have won it it's
[9065.48 - 9077.64] P:1853.35 E:0.320277 |  Italy's title one one after extra time and three two in the penalty shootout Donnarumma
[9077.64 - 9086.92] P:1876.84 E:0.319028 |  outstanding two saves from Sancho and then from Saca and it is Italy who become European champions
[9086.92 - 9092.92] P:1926.65 E:0.317598 |  for the first time for over half a century
