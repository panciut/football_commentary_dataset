  "transcript": " The noise has been absolutely incredible. Here we go, whistle blows, Sandro Scherer, Swiss referee gets us under way. Celtic pressing immediately, not the best back pass from David Alaba. Few nerves maybe, caught to our quickly out to the edge of the area and clears it away for a Celtic throw. Chelsea beaten in the 5-45 kickoff against Dino Mote at Zagreb this evening. Early chance for Celtic, Abadah just wide with his right foot, took a deflection, goes behind for a corner. Celtic are on it straight away. That's an incredible start. Look, they're going to take the corner quick as well. First of all, Jack and Marcus pressing, Cortoine to the throw in, they throw it quick. Nice little interplay between Jack and Marcus, Abadah gets his shot away and it's deflected, dream start for Celtic. I know it's early, but that's exactly how they would have wanted to start the game. It's what they do, domestic, it's what they did to Rangers on Saturday in the 4-0 win, too quick, too sharp, inventive, but so precise with it as well. And Postacoglu said, opportunities like this come around very few times in a lifetime. Why limit yourself? Why stop doing what you've done to get here? That's what Celtic are going to do tonight and they've won themselves another corner. Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, Bedlam inside the stadium. And on the flip side of that, it comes out, this recie, click back, it goes back to Jens, comes into McGregor, it's round the corner, it's out to Taylor. All the way, Real Madrid, they're putting pressure on, it just can't get near the minute. Minute and a half played in the game, corner comes into the penalty, nearly fell to a barter again, just rolls gently into the arms of Thibault Courtois, off a couple of deflections, so his 10-outfield teammates all in black. Thibault Courtois in sort of cherry red this evening, away to our right-hand side. Borussia Dortmund have beaten FC Coburn, Hagen by three goals for Niel. Chelsea beaten, one nil, away to Dino Mosa, Grev, they're at home to Red Bull Salzburg next week, they've already a bit of pressure on that fixture for them, and as we were hearing England's women already three goals for the good against Luxembourg in the World Cup qualified, commentary continues over on five, sports extra, a barter, two goals against Rangers for the young Israeli on the weekend, plays it into Matto Reilly, good first touch, Modric darts in to win the ball back for Madrid, they try and play out inside their own half, as soon as they get possession, you hear the cheers and the whistles, and Venetius Jr., the scorer of the winning goal against Liverpool in Paris in May, flicks it back to Courtois, Real Madrid will not be hassled, they will not be harried, they're going to take their time. Yeah, of course they will. Huge experience side, top level players within the top team, and they know how to win games, they know how to deal with teams at press, and teams at trying, no force mistakes, you see them now, they're just not in the ball about almost, go and sell to continue making that break, so they can go and exploit that, you know, hugely experienced side, they will not be fazed by the start that Celtic have had. Great build up from Real Madrid from the back, two of them, and he's balling to Modric, quickly flicked on to Valverde on the right-hand side, Benzema making ground in the middle, Carter Vickers has it covered, comes in, bollies it away with his left foot over the head of Jota, he leaps to try and win the head of Carvajal, is back there, Celtic might win this on the halfway line, try and build again, Jota couldn't quite find, Jack O'Mack is Matto Riley, the 21-year-old, comes hurtling forward to press Courtois, Alibar under pressure, but Real Madrid very cool, he quickly passing, played out from the back and fell on Mendy, the left back has Venetius Jr. running towards him, tries to flick the ball beyond Yuranovic, gets lucky with the rebound, Venetius Jr. on the way, moving at speed, Yuranovic gets a foot in, half stops him, Venetius Jr. again and then Yuranovic is a bit rash, comes through the back of him and concedes an early free kick. Really rash, absolutely spot on Ali by Yuranovic, he gets down initially, does well to get back, Carter Vickers comes over and covers and forces him back the way towards the sideline, Yuranovic doesn't have to make the challenge and now they have to go and defend this way free kick. Venetius Jr. on the halfway line, tried that turn that he did on Fernandinho against Manchester City last season, if you remember, got away and scored the goal, and Yuranovic you could see, you could almost feel the panic from here, he felt he had to deal with it, well he's conceded the free kick, four minutes gone at Celtic Park, Sevilla Manchester City underway, as far as I'm aware that's still 0-0, Conor McNamara will continue to bring us updates of that one, Celtic-Nil Real Madrid-Nil and the referee, Sandro Scherer, just making his presence felt before this free kick, he's bringing young Moritz Jens, the German centre back for Celtic, out from the middle, as well as I think Edair Milletow, Real Madrid's Brazilian centre back, they were having a bit of two and throw, pushing and shoving, Jens marking him at the far post, free kick taken by Crows, it's driven deep, Valverde takes a touch, kills a cross in towards Alaba, headed away, aborted with a second header, and there's the little graceful Elfin figure of Luca Modric, controls it, plays the pass and Real Madrid come back into their own half. So Celtic got Johart in goal, Yeranovich, Carter Jens and Greg Taylor are back four, Callum McGregor, the skipper at the base of midfield, Matto Riley and Rio Hattate either side of him, Lille Labarda and Jota are the wingers with Georgios Jacomakis as the centre forward, Keogos on the bench, Sevilla against Manchester City underway, here's Conor McNamara. Yeah, it's still Sevilla-Nil, Manchester City-Nil, we've played exactly six with it, Erling Hallens had a touch and he didn't score with it, which the way he's been playing lately feels like worth pointing out. The city centre forward waiting for more service to come his way, but it's mostly defending city of attitude so far, Papu Gomez has looked good for Sevilla, it's Sevilla-Nil, Manchester City-Nil. Best pass of the night from Rio Hattate, has found Jota wide on the left-hand side, couldn't find Greg Taylor on the overlapping run, Real Madrid have the ball back inside their own half, Modric, little shoulder shake from him, he can't flip with the outside of his right foot, plays it across his penalty area to the Austrian international, David Alaba, fell on Mendy the left back, back to Courtois inside his own six-yard box, Millet-Tow, side footed pass out to the right-hand side, and Real Madrid are able just to release that pressure and bring the ball forward to the halfway line. Paris Saint-Germain have scored early on against Juventus, PSG won Juventus nearly one of the eight-o-clock kick-offs this evening. Listen to our commentary tonight, by the way, here at Celtic Park, alongside the final score graphics and the video-printer, you can do that via the BBC iPlayer, the red button and the BBC Sport app, just click on five-live final score, and Bapé with the goal for Paris Saint-Germain. So we're watching Benzema, Harlan's in action tonight, and Bapé has scored. The Champions League is back with a bang, as the Celtic fans were saying. Celtic and Rangers both a part of it, commentary on Rangers in Amsterdam tomorrow, a way to Ajax at 5.45. A lot of patient Real Madrid build-up at the moment. I'll give you their full-team lineup when we get our next break in play. More thoughts from James McFadden as well, who was with Rangers a couple of weeks ago in the Netherlands, and watched them beat PSV Eindhoven by a goal to an ill to make it into the group stages, crossing to the edge of the box here, header away from Jens, Jota with a second header, Modric is there, just leaps up in the air, cushions the pass down the right to Carvajal. Back to Modric, first-time ball does reach Tony Crows. Not sure that was the intended target, Real Madrid having a lot of early possession games. Yeah, as you would expect, they're not going to be phased, although the atmosphere has been absolutely terrific. They will not be phased by the atmosphere, they won't be phased by the fact that Celtic are going to try and put them under pressure, and the actual fact, Celtic are just dropping off and maybe looking to pick the moments to go and press and put Real Madrid under pressure, but they won't be phased. There are too many good players, too many top-top players, comfortable with the ball, even if they're in trouble. You've seen it early, Vinicius had nothing on, he clicks it back to Courtois, they go out the other side and they get that break. So, yeah, they will be patient, and it's something that Celtic are going to have to deal with, because not a lot of teams, certainly, domestically will do that to Celtic. It's the fascinating, really fascinating thing about this evening. Celtic so rampant at the start of this season, domestically 29-goals scored, just the two conceded, both against Ross County, and how will it translate to the European stage? It didn't last season, that was a different Celtic team. Labour Cousin were 4-0 winners here, Bodo Glimp knocked them out of the Europa Conference League on a disappointing night for Celtic. Vinicius Jr. has gone down easily, claiming he was whacked in the face. Celtic on the high press, Alaba plays it quickly back to Courtois. Courtois, again getting the wolf whistles from the fans, sweeps it away with his left foot, fell on Mendy. Now, that was an elbow, it looked like, in the face of Jack Amakis, and the referee blows his whistle, and then with the finger, just beckons Mendy towards him. I think Carlo Ancelotti, James, is complaining about the previous one, they felt on Vinicius Jr. Yeah, Colin McGregor has stepped across Vinicius, and he goes down, the referee was right in the spot, decides not to give it, and that one with Mendy, he is running up the line, he puts his arm out, almost defends Jack Amakis off, he doesn't swing it, but it catches him in the face with the arm, right in front of the referee, fourth official is down there as well, I think it's a correct decision, and... Carlo Ancelotti is obviously going to be claiming for that, of course. He looks on with one eyebrow raised, that will not surprise you to hear that, being there, seeing it done it, has Carlo Ancelotti. Gary Flint has seen another goal for England's women against Luxembourg, Gary. Yep, 4-0, Rachel Daly, far post, clever header down, pass the keeper, England 4, Luxembourg 0. Contrary over on Radio 5, Sports Extra, Mendy got the yellow card, he's on the ball now for Real Madrid, plays it up to the edge of the Celtic box, Carter Vickers was able to step in in front of Benzema, who has so often plays with that right wrist, strapped in the white bandage, jotted chest the ball down on the halfway line for Celtic, so they're in the green and white hoops, white shorts, hoops socks, playing from left to right towards the Lisbon Lion stand in this first half. Yuranovic urged on by the fans, plays it to Matto Riley, tries to give it back to him, it goes through Yuranovic's legs, here's a barter on the right-hand side to try and keep the momentum going for Celtic. Callan McGregor plays a little 1-2 with Greg Taylor, slides the pass forward, a Riley into a Tarte, nearly finds Jackamac, his alabar is there to clear for Real Madrid, that is exactly what Celtic try and do to their opponents, it very nearly came off. Very nearly, dad, but now they have to go and defend, the nice and speed of Real Madrid's counter. Venetius Jr. now looking for the 1-2 with Benzema, gets it back to Venetius Jr., inside the penalty area, 7 yards up from the byline, crossed to the back post, Benzema tries to hit the left foot volley, Modric with the left foot volley, that's blocked, comes back to Venetius Jr., takes one touch, and he's going to have a little run at Yuranovic, tries to take Yuranovic on the inside, Celtic win the ball back with a barter, a barter thinks about dribbling out of the penalty area, Modric closes him down, Real Madrid just starting to suffocate Celtic at this point in the game, 11 minutes gone in the first half, Tua Meneze, 30 yards out, plays it across to Valverde in a central position, Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, live from inside Celtic Park, you can listen to us on five live, also available on the BBC Sounds app tonight, Tua Meneze, little diagonal ball into the edge of the Celtic box, cleared on the volley, only as far as Mende on the right hand side, here's Tony Kroos, Kroos to Modric, Kroos curling pass out to the left to Mende, Celtic with defending to do at the moment, Modric is on the ball in the inside left channel, teases one inside to Benzema, Benzema gets the back heel from Venetius Junior, Yuranovic slides in, clears it behind for a corner, Gary Flint off, seeing another England goal, Gary. Yep, five nil, Beth Mead with the snake hips, pass to the defenders, slotted past the goalkeeper, England five, Luxembourg nil. Dino Mosa, grab one, Chelsea nil a result in the Champions League this evening, PSG one up on Juventus, Borussia Dortmund beat FC Copenhagen by three goals to nil, Real Madrid have a corner here at Celtic Park, it's Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, Tony Kroos pauses, takes a breath, jogs towards the ball, high curling one to the far post, foul in there, tug on the shirt, Celtic take the free kick quickly, of course they do, and here they come on the counter, Abaddon in eight, there's a space on the right hand side, Jota tries to phone in, he might have done it as well, Abaddon with the right foot shot, hits it straight to Courtois, what a chance, James McFadden. Oh, it's a huge chance, and you're absolutely spot on, I'll come back to you, because Real Madrid are countering again. Incredible stuff, end to end, we thought it might be, Venetius Jr, couple of step-overs, here's Benzema, head to the Celtic penalty area, looking for that curler into the top corner, closed down quickly, so couldn't hit the shot, back it comes to Modric, Modric side-foot's a little ball, to the young French international, Tua Mane, back to Modric, he'll be 37, on Friday he's over-hit the pass, very unlike him, Carvajal can't control it, James. Yes, Wells, the corner come in, referee blow for a free kick, Celtic as they do, played it quick, Matt O'Reilly's breaking, just up the left-hand side, and it's easy for us to see, we can see if he reverses it, Abaddon's in, he chooses to go to Jota, who could obviously see Abaddon, he plays a ball just inside the shoulder, of Ferram Mende, and Abaddon's shot is just tamish, he doesn't catch it. That noise means Celtic pouring forward, Abaddon's got that run, unfortunately, Yuranovic passed it out to the right, Abaddon side-footed it, I think he was looking for the cross to Jaco Macus, and he slightly sliced it into the side netting. Yeah, again, it's good play, Celtic breaking at speed, Yuranovic's just waiting for his moment to play Abaddon, he's got O'Reilly, he's got Jaco Macus, he has Jota in the box, I think he's just trying to bend that last line of defence, he just gets it all wrong, comes off the inside, he's footing it to the side net, and it's a couple of times now where he's had opportunities, particularly with that shot that I just spoke about, had a chance to maybe take a touch, and it looked like he tried to go for power and just didn't get it, and then that one there, it's a great opportunity for Celtic to put a ball across, the trademark move, if you like, and he just gets it wrong, but still encouraging them getting these opportunities. Celtic have made a good start to this game, they've won the ball back off Real Madrid, inside the Real Madrid half, looking for a free kick, for the challenge on Jota, O'Reilly gets the ball, advantage possibly played, not going to come back for the free kick, Shouimani is able to bring it away for the European champions, Vinicius Jr. He's in the mood this evening, Francis Arana, Yuranovic again, this time stops in his tracks, plays it in field to Shouimani, now clips one forward, Katowice reads it brilliantly, Benzema was making the run behind him, Celtic have the ball back inside their own half, 15 minutes gone, Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, Celtic look confident, Jokes, don't they? Yeah, they do, in the game, I know we're really early on, it has lived up to what we expected, Celtic are trying to attack, of course it's not all out attack, they're trying to put pressure on at the right moment, in Real Madrid, when they break, the pace at the break-up, is phenomenal, they've got so much control when they win the ball back, but you look at Celtic now, they're just knocking the ball about, they're waiting for the opportunity, and how they build up, as the two centre-backs split the width of the 18, Kallon McGregor drops, you've got the two full-backs that join in, and then Hatati Noreilly, join in with the front three of Obada, Jackamac is in Jota, trying to entice that press, so they can then change the tempo and turn that into an attack. Yuranovic looking for Jackamac, it goes down inside the penalty area, Eddair Militão was wrestling with him, referee had a good view of it, probably six or one and a half a dozen of the other Celtic fans don't like the decision, and then fell on Mendy, sort of bought a free kick down by the byline, he waited for the challenge from Matt O'Reilly, who came gently into the back of him, down he went, and Real Madrid will have a chance to clear their lives, that wasn't a penalty, was it? I would like to see it again, but there is a bit of wrestling going on, I think you're right, it's six or one and a half a dozen of the other, and Jackamac is, you always look at the players' reaction, he does go down, he's straight back up to put pressure on, he obviously didn't feel it was a penalty, and he just got on with it, but that was again Celtic just knocking the ball about waiting for that opportunity, and then it's put round the corner to Jackamac, who will be a handful because of his work rate, because of his physicality, and they just can't keep it alive on that occasion. Real Madrid taking an age actually to take this free kick, Alaba chips it forward, Tua Mane heads it towards the half-way line, absolutely no-one there, and Ancelotti just throws his arms up in disgust at that, Celtic have the ball back again, don't forget Real Madrid did actually lose four games in the Champions League last season on the way to winning the title, one of those at home to Sherif Tirisfal in the group stages, also lost to PSG Chelsea in Manchester City in the knockout stages, RB Leipzig 1-0 down against Shakhtar in this group, cross into the Real Madrid penalty area, headed away, Carvajal is well forward for the visitors, but Celtic have enough bodies to win it back, Calan McGregor plays a little 1-2 with Río Hatate, brilliant to have the Champions League group stages, back on five live in BBC sounds, two more commentaries coming your way tomorrow, Ajax against Rangers kicks off at 5.45, Napoli against Liverpool, our commentary at 8 o'clock, Mark Chapman presenting from Huffpast 5 tomorrow afternoon, and John Murray will be at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to bring you updates at Tottenham against Marseille. England against Luxembourg has reached half-time in the women's World Cup qualifier, will bring you details on that after this Celtic attack, Hatate has put it between Jotar and Abadda, neither could get to it, caught off his line, here's Gary Clinton. Yep, England five up at the break, Ali, two for Stanway, one each for Rousseau, Daly and Mead, expect some experimentation in the second half from Serena Begwin, England five, Luxembourg now. Celtic, Niel Rehm, Madrid, Niel, talking about those two commentaries tomorrow, tomorrow morning first thing, later on tonight as well, on the BBC sounds app, the Champions League of Waydays podcast return, so our teams in Amsterdam and Naples will bring you previews of those two big ties ahead of the commentaries tomorrow. Niel Niel here at Celtic Park in the company of James McFadden and Roddy Forsythe, Real Madrid, building down the right with Danny Carvajal, he's got support from Valverde, Modric comes tiptoeing across back to Carvajal, Valverde makes a run infield with the ball at his feet, outside of his right foot, lovely clip pass to Mendy on the left, level with the edge of the Celtic penalty area, David Alaba takes a touch, high cross into the back post towards Benzema, can't reach him, it'll stay in place, so Greg Taylor's got to deal with it, drives it forward on the half volley, suddenly it's one on one between Militão and Jakim Macis, Militão wins the header, has to chase his own header back to the byline, then on the turn, clears it out for a Celtic throw, and I think Celtic are going to take that James extremely quickly, they do, jotter, looking for O'Reilly, could have found Obada in the middle, but instead the ball has gone behind for a corner, James McFarrum. That is almost identical to the goal they scored at the weekend, quick throw in, there's O'Reilly's shoulder, he hits it first time, almost goes to Obada, and that is what Celtic do, they just get the ball in play as soon as they can, put bodies forward, and put you under pressure. Celtic fans, masses of them leaning forward, watching the corner come in, Courtois punches it away, Hachate! Drives the volley, Courtois makes the save, straight at him, but went with real power, Celtic still attacking, ball inside that Real Madrid penalty area, Real Madrid get a foot in, cleared away by Militão, first goal in the game in Seville, Conor McNamara. And in Seville, it's Manchester City 1, and it's Erling Haaland, the first of what city fans hope will be a lot of Champions League goals in Sky Blue for them, Kevin De Bruyne onto full, it's passed down the right, had a little look, played it in Lowenheim, and sliding through was Erling Haaland for Sevilla Niel, Manchester City 1, 20 minutes play. Well, somehow here at Celtic Park, it's still Niel Niel, Callum McGregor has just hit a rasping drive from 20 yards, and it's come crashing back off the inside of the post, James. That was brilliant play again, down the left hand side, little cut back into the feet of Jack O'Marcus, he has his back to go, it looks like he's going to spin, and try and get his shot away, it doesn't, he lays it, onto the unrushing Callum McGregor, who smashes it off the post, incredible, caught to a beating, half of the crowd, if not more, thought it was in. What a period of football this is for Celtic. Wow, they've got Real Madrid on the ropes at the moment, so Erling Haaland has Manchester City a goal to the good in Seville, Chelsea beaten by Dino Mosaagreb earlier on, Celtic Park in full song, back in the Champions League group stages, and giving Real Madrid a run for their money, 0-0 Callum McGregor's shot coming back off the post, here's Mendy to Kroos, Kroos to Benzemaal, Benzemaal back to Mendy, this build-up play taking place just inside, the Celtic half on the left hand side, we'll get some more thoughts and ready for side in just a second. Here's Tua Mane, Tua Mane to Carvajal, Carvajal back to Militao, the centre back, Tony Kroos drops between the two centre backs inside his own half, whips it forward into the feet of Modric, able to turn, looks up, didn't see Benzemaal in the middle, so goes low to his right to find Valverde de Uruguayne with the peroxide hair, Benzemaal is the link man, 1-2 with Modric, we're going to find Modric again, Celtic get bodies around him, Greg Taylor with the first-time clearance, Celtic having to do that as well, up towards Jackimakis, he's in the one-on-one again, Celtic win the throw. And that is the difference between Jackimakis and Keogal, he looks to get away from defenders and then try and exploit the spaces that they leave, Jackimakis loves the physical contact, so in this occasion, certainly in a couple of occasions tonight, he is the out-ball and he will force those mistakes, you look at Militao, no chances, just put it out, he didn't want to take a touch because the new Jackimakis was there, waiting to put pressure on him, and that is what he's doing, he's causing all sorts of problems up there. Done it again as well, good battling for the ball, this time the throw and it's gone to Real Madrid, Celtic, Real Madrid, let's pause for breath as they take the throw, let's bring in Roddy Fasai. What have you made of the first quarter of the game? Well, you have to say that Angé Postercoglu has been as good as he's worked, Celtic haven't altered their style, they've been a little more cautious, here they are again inside the pounce box, over to you. Yeah, Hitate to O'Reilly, back to Hitate, tackled by Carvajal, back to Roddy in just a second, Modric working it with Tua Mane, little flick from Benzema, doesn't get enough on the pass, Celtic busy in themselves to win it back, a barter is tackled by Benzema, Real Madrid decide to go to the right-hand side inside their own arm, Modric to Tua Mane, he had time to turn, high floated ball gives you Ranevic a chance to beat Benzema in the air, wins the next ball infield to Abadda, why do you Ranevic tries to get it back infield to O'Reilly, the deflected pass is intercepted by Abadda, O'Reilly makes the tackle, Real Madrid get the throw, Roddy. I made a note when Abadda shot into the arms of Cottoir, at that point Celtic had six players inside the Real penalty area, less than half a minute later, every Celtic player was within 30 yards of their own goal. It's exactly what we hoped it would be, what a ticket to have if you're a Celtic fan tonight. It's incredible, I just get the feeling that, you know, Celtic are having chances, can they take one? Because we know the quality Real Madrid have, we know they can change the tempo of a game in the blink of an eye, but it has lived up to all expectations and hopefully it continues, I'm sure it will, but what a game it's been. I think you can probably hear the smiles in our voices. 67 accredited media for Real Madrid tonight, James McFadden had to act as photographer for a few of them ahead of the game. By the way, if they score, they're sitting in front of us, the radio commentators, you will know about it, I can promise you, even inside this atmosphere here at Celtic Park. Celtic have won a throw, they've taken it quickly, 25 minutes gone, and as James and Roddy have both been saying, and Postercoglu, as good as his words, Celtic going for Real Madrid, and being given encouragement as well. Greg Taylor steaming up the left-hand side, challenges for the ball, Militão heads it away, Taylor's going to take the throw, thinks about it, Jota runs past him, Taylor holds onto it, now Hattate makes a run, Celtic players fizzing around, Taylor just can't decide which one to throw it to at the moment, now releases it, gets it back from O'Reilly, O'Reilly's low ball into the Real Madrid box, intercepted by Tuan Mayne, Carvajal clears on the turn, another throw into Celtic, taking quickly PSG 2, Juventus 0, Hattate, down at the byline, all when it's deflected into the side netting, and Celtic have a corner, and Bapé has his second goal of the night for Paris Saint-Germain, they lead Juventus by two goals to 0, Celtic could so easily be a goal all two up here. Yeah, some of the play has been excellent, that looked like it, and then this side of the net, it hit the side netting, what about a play as again? Oh, corner for Celtic, Jota kills it, in court, Jota is underneath it, good goalkeeping, takes it right off the top of the head of Jack O'Maccus, slings it out underarm quickly, now Benzemaar has laid the ball off, and is wincing, and is limping up towards the halfway line, my taxi driver today told me he'd heard a ruin that Benzemaar wasn't going to start the game, so maybe he knew more than he was letting on, here's Valverde on the right-hand side, Benzemaar is in discomfort, definitely, seems to be a problem with the right leg, Lynchpin of course for Real Madrid, the captain, the man who scored so many goals for them on the way to the trophy last season, did so much damage in the knockout stages, he's going to try and run it off, in the meantime, Real Madrid continue to play keep ball inside the Celtic half, Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, Manchester City one nil up, away to Sevilla, and he ram on Sanchez, piece one, stadium, Conor McNamara with the updates this evening, Valverde to Carvajal, cut back here looking for Vinicius, headed away but only as far as Carvajal, back it comes to Valverde looking for support on the edge of the box, Croce hits it first time, skidding shot goes wide, and behind for the Celtic goal kick, James McFarron. Yeah, I've been looking at Benzemaar, I wonder if he's just jarred his knee, he keeps trying to, you know, if possible stretch it off, but having had plenty knee problems in my career, I know it looks like he's struggling with his knee, but when the ball goes wide to Valverde there, he's alive again, so I think it might be all right. No, no, he's signalling to say, he needs change to the bench. Yeah, that could be that for Carriene Benzemaar, play continues, Celtic oppressing Courtois, has the ball at his feet, has played at this stadium before Tebow Courtois. I was going to make the point at the start when you say the Real Madrid first team have warmed up, you know, the subs didn't warm up, they've been forced into a relatively early change, I wonder if that has an impact. Have you ever seen that? I mean, maybe they were warming up inside... There's no where in there at the moment, let me tell you that. There is no where for them to warm up in there, but it was strange. And I was thinking that, if they're forced into an early change, well, will they be ready? Yeah, Valverde bringing it forward, so Benzemaar's still out there, and looking dangerous edge of the box, but he is struggling and he does want to come off. Celtic nail, Real Madrid nail. Now, let's not have too much sympathy for the European champions, because Quijogo is on the bench for Celtic, not able to start the game tonight, he would have been their first choice centre-forward. So it's tipped for... In that sense, if Benzemaar does come off, Arby Salzburg have taken the lead against the Italian champions, AC Milan. Valverde causing problems again for Celtic down the right, Cross comes into the near post, Chuimani the furthest forward, beating in the air, Celtic, Cliric, Modric is there, flicks a little pass back, to the halfway line, and Real Madrid will start to recycle again. Yeah, and this is a period in the match where Celtic have dropped off Real Madrid, and almost allowed the ball in front, but they have such quick movement, speed of thought, that they are getting down the sides, as you would expect, but it's just almost like they're taking a little breather, they're not going chasing it, because they will leave gaps, but they're quite happy, I would say, for Real Madrid to have the ball, not in this area. Carvajal, little ball with the out of his right, but Valverde, just wide with his left foot, that went like an absolute rocket, and there was a flash of yellow, as Johar, he was worried through himself, full length to the left hand side, went behind for the goal kick, Real Madrid are going to have to make the change, thoughts from Roddy Versailles. Looks like Eden Hazard is going to come on, isn't it, for Benzema. The lessers spotted. Yes, and there we go, and that's a forced change that Real Madrid will not wish to have made. No, well that's interesting. Eden Hazard, two substitute appearances so far, for Real Madrid this season. Not a bad player though, let's get to Seville, Conor McNamara. Just approaching the half, our mark still Seville, and El Manchester City won the goal from Erling Hallad, City have just had a free kick, taken by Kevin De Bruyne, close, but into the side netting, City are dominating now, Seville did well in the early stages, but City on top, Seville and El Manchester City won. So, Carin Benzema drags himself from the field, he's level on 86 Champions League goals at the moment, with Robert Lewandowski, who will play in this season's competition for Barcelona. Quick word with Ancelotti, you noticed there, James, sort of respectful applause from the Celtic fans for one of the greats. Yeah, they applauded Benzema off, I think it'll be delighted to see him going off as well, to be fair, but yeah, I think it is. I think the recognition is a great of the game, playing at the highest level, great numbers last season for Benzema. I think it's just appreciation from the Celtic fans, which are not here, but in general, you don't often see from away fans. Celtic Niel Real Madrid Niel, former Scotland international, James McFadden used to scoring big goals on the biggest stages, particularly for his country, alongside us in the commentary position at Celtic Park tonight, and Celtic have made a really good start to this game, and a really good start on their return to the Champions League group stages. Leipzig and Schachtar Dignetsk, the other two teams in this group, Schachtar one up away to Leipzig at the moment, a barter on the right, tries to get a low cross in, Mendy deals with it, closes him down and blocks it at close range. So Hazard has dropped into the centre-forward's position, good dribbler in the ball, runs straight to Moritz Jens, is felled and is flat on his face in the centre-circle. Terrible injury problems for Aiden Hazard, since joining Real Madrid. Fourth season at the club, 68 appearances so far, and just the six goals. And if you think, James, of what he was at Chelsea, Real Madrid have seen barely glimpses of that. They've seen nowhere near the Aiden Hazard, that we all got to witness in the Premier League, it was absolutely sensational, and you felt as though he was going to go and be one of their galacticals, one of their superstars, it just hasn't quite worked out for him. But you see him there, picking off, he wants to get in a half-turn, not Meg on Jens, Calvary Gregor is covering, but he is brought down, and that's a different proposition for Celtic, because Benzmann would have played that earlier to Valverde, I've no doubt about it, but Hazard wants to go and take people on. Like in the look of young Tua Mani in central midfield, lovely little body swerve to beat Hitata, it's with Valverde, little one-two with Hazard on the edge of the Celtic box. Celtic-Nil, Real Madrid-Nil, Modric, with one of those cheeky little outside-of-the-right footballs, doesn't find its target, and Johard comes racing across to collect it. So, five times Champions League winners for Real Madrid in this starting line-up tonight. Carvajal, Modric and Benzmann, who is now off the field, of course, in terms of the Celtic squad this evening. Three players who were last involved when Celtic were last in the group stages under Bretton Rogers back in 2017-18, one of those, the skipper, Callum McGregor, who struck the inside of the post this evening. Real Madrid having a little spell of possession here. Carvajal floats a pass back onto the chest of Alibar, he was aware of Abadda closing in behind him, so just shields the ball away from him, low to crows. Venetius Jr. comes towards the ball, lays it off to Mendy on the left-hand side. I hope this atmosphere is coming through loud and clear wherever you're listening to us on five live BBC sounds this evening. Carvajal on the right for Real Madrid, Nil-Nil, Tua-Maini takes his time, rolls the pass to Valverde. Valverde wide on the right back to Tua-Maini, first time layoff to Carvajal, Celtic having to chase, but keeping Real Madrid out from the danger zones at the moment. Kroos passes across the halfway line, Edair Militão encouraged to bring it forward, Valverde hugging the touchline on the right, infield pass to Modric, loses it, Jota dribbling out, Carvajal slides in, meaty challenge takes the ball, Jota picks himself up, Celtic worked it quickly to the right, and then, bit like the old Bino character, Billy Wiz, with his legs speeding away down the right, making ground for Celtic, back it comes to Callum McGregor. McGregor strokes it with his left foot to Greg Taylor, the left back popping up in the centre, so what do you see with the Celtic fullbacks? The fullbacks come in and play in midfield positions to try and tempt the opposition to go and put pressure on, they're so comfortable doing it, and it's worked really well. Greg Taylor, in particular this season, has been sensational for Celtic, and it's no surprise, he's a good player, probably doesn't get the clod, he deserves it, but that's how he wants to play, he wants to build up from the back, he wants to take risks, we heard them speak yesterday, if there's the greater the risk, the greater the reward sometimes, and that's the way they play. That's why the Celtic fans absolutely love it, and love And post-Akoglu, Yuranovic, by the way, got a massive cheer for a really well-timed tackle on Venetius Junior, Celtic have it on the left, Jota going on the outside of Carvajal, deflected cross, headed away by Militão, Hazard leaps in the air, miss cue pass, Jota, he ends, reads it, steps forward, Greg Taylor into Jack-o-mack, he tries to turn Militão, bundles into a couple of Real Madrid defenders, and the referee says he's being overly physical there against Carvajal and Militão, so Real Madrid get the free kick, just short of 35 minutes played in the first half, Celtic nil Real Madrid nil, but if you have just tuned in, Celtic have not only James given as good as they got, they could easily have scored, and McGregor struck the post, and they've had another chance for a barter as well. Yeah, Celtic have had the best chances in the game, there's no doubt about it, and they've played really well. It hasn't been the gung-ho throw bodies forward every opportunity, there's been a bit more control in when to go and press, but when they've broke, they've broke with the same intensity, the same speed, and just looking before that, when the ball comes to Hazard, because it's not Benzema, he tries to flick it first time, you know, he has to hold that in, and then play it, but he's not playing the lot of football, he's not going to centre-forward, which isn't his natural position, but that's the thing that Real Madrid will be missing from that intelligence, that know-how of playing that position, no one went to take a touch, no one went to play it first time, and Hazard will need to learn that quick, because if he does that again, Celtic are just encouraged to go and press and attack. Celtic nil Real Madrid nil, Manchester City one nil up, away to Sevilla, Erling Haaland with the goal, and Bapay has two tonight for Paris Saint-Germain, they lead Juventus by two goals, this group's Shakhtar Dignetsk one up, away to RB Leipzig, and the Italian champions AC Milano behind, away to Salzburg. Valverde on the ball, edge of the Celtic area, this is dangerous. For Posterkoglu's team, ball breaks loose down by the byline, Valverde whips the cross in, it's over-hit, it's beyond Milletown, who sort of puts his hands to his face, he's sort of mock horror, thinking, wow, if the cross was right there, I was in for a free header at the far post. Chelsea beaten by a goal to nil away to Dino Mosa, grabbed this evening, reaction to that, I'm sure, later on in the show tonight. Also in the Football Daily podcast, available for you on the BBC Sounds tomorrow. Another goal for England's women in the World Cup, qualifier against Luxembourg early in the second half, Gary Flintot. Yep, two minutes into the second half, it's six nil, Bethany England came on at the break, two minutes later, she's scored from close range, England six, Luxembourg now. Will they get the nine that Celtic got against Dundee United the other day? Let's wait and see. First-time ball looking for a barter from Hattate, covered by Alaba, back to Courtois, Courtois, who, as I said, has been here before with Atletico Madrid for a Europa League tie back in November 2011, so he knows what European nights at this stadium are all about. Hugely experienced players in the Real Madrid team, but I also remember the likes of Messi and Javi talking about their visits here and being, you know, for players of that stature to be blown away by an atmosphere. Carvajal on the ball, on the right foot for Real Madrid. They've had plenty of possession in the first half, there has been threat, you would definitely expect that. Here's Croce running away from Jaquimakis, curling low ball across the halfway line, Venetius drops the shoulder onto his right foot, and then he makes a little run beyond him on the left, stabs the ball in field to Croce, Croce at walking pace, plays it onto Modric, darts forward, 25 yards out, slides it to his right to Valverde, now Carvajal, back to Valverde again, corner of the Celtic box, looking for Hazard, cleared, only as far as Felau Mende, Real Madrid's left back, and Venetius is going to get another run at Juranovic, who's so carefully watching that Champions League in Blazend football at the tricky feet of Venetius Junior. Hazard on the ball, wide on the left, rolls it back to Croce, early cross into the far post, Carvajal there with the knockback, Kartevicas reads it, his clearance goes straight up in the air, the offside flag goes up in the air, Celtic will get a free kick, James McFadden. Yeah, but it's something that they've been looking for. When the ball comes from the left into the right, and that inside channel, Valverde makes a run, Carvajal makes a run, that diagonal run in behind Greg Taylor, and this occasion Greg Taylor can see Valverde's there, but he can't see Carvajal coming in behind Valverde, and it's something that maybe Jota has to switch on and get him beside. Thankfully, you know, for Celtic, it is offside, but it's something that Real Madrid are trying to play. Yeah, a couple of the crosses have been over hit as well. Militows come through the back of Jack O'Macken. Look at that, the ball was stopped still. Hattate runs forward, just clips it, takes the free kick, Jota into the penalty area on the left, there's the cross, too close to Courtois, who gathers it easily at the near post. He was looking for a barter, again a classic example of what Celtic do. Hattate switched on, and there's a foul from the centre forward, he was just back on his feet, number seven on number seven. Jack O'Macken clatters into Hazard and apologises with a little kiss on the back of his head. Yeah, and he's taken a sore one in the leg as well with that tackle. It's just the commitment that he's got, you know, Jack O'Macken to go what, put pressure on. I don't know if he had to make that foul because of where it was, and if you're, you know, in Hazard, you don't want him anywhere near you at box, if he's in his own half, then you don't need to be diving in. He didn't get booked, he could have done, but, you know, he's taken a little knock, and hopefully it's not too serious. Still goalless at Celtic Park, five minutes remaining, and what's been a thoroughly entertaining, atmospheric, intriguing first half. And Prostakoglu, I'm not sure the hands have come out of the pockets for the entire first half. Two incredibly laid-back managers, actually, Prostakoglu and Ancelotti. Ancelotti's got the arms crossed in his dark, smart suit, Valverde down the right to Modric, Hattate breathing down his neck. Modric tries to turn him, almost does that, lays it back here to Carvajal, Carvajal low-crossing. Oh, it went all the way through to Hazard. It's slightly miscued, the ball is loose, it eventually goes behind, and it is a goal kick. Hazard got the last touch. Could have scored. He should have scored. There's a huge lay-off. Spoke about that run, and behind the fill-backs. Hazard just peels off the back of Yiranovic. Celtic are giving it away, Valverde is onto it. Callum McGregor has rescued Celtic twice in the last couple of minutes, being alert to the danger. It's gone behind for a Celtic goal kick. They'll take that quickly. Cardovic is under pressure, plays the pass out in plenty of time. Here's Hattate, Hattate down the right to Yiranovic. Yiranovic crosses the halfway line. Tony Kroos comes towards him, Yiranovic stops, plays it back to Hattate, heading back to Seville. Shortly last we heard Manchester City leading Seville by a goal to Nill. Greg Taylor quickly onto Jota. Jota's not really been able to express himself too much in the first half. Little step over from him. He loves the tricks, loves the flicks. He was doing plenty of that on Saturday. Celtic back to Jens on the halfway line, to Carter Vickers, good, crisp low pass to the right. Yiranovic gets a crossing. That's good delivery, but it's beyond O'Reilly and it's beyond Jack O'Mackess. And out it goes for a Celtic throw, roared on by the Celtic fans. Jota sprints to take the throw quickly. Ball is back in play immediately. Here's McGregor, drops the shoulder to try and lose Modric. Carter Vickers, another fabulous ball from the centre back. Whitey Yiranovic, low cross driven in, indecepted by Kroos. Hazard plays a first-time ball up towards Venetius, back to Hazard. Stokey figure, left-footed ball over the top, offside flag stays down. This is trouble for Celtic. Venetius Jr. in on goal. Johar Fabulous comes out, makes himself big and makes an absolutely vital save for Celtic. That's a huge save. I have to say, first glance, I thought it was Miles offside, but the flag stayed down and Johar comes out and narrows the angle. It looks like he's going to just open his foot and pass it into the far corner and Johar stays big, stops himself from being dinked as well and it's a brilliant save. Would have been checked by the video assistant referee, of course, Hattarte, first-time ball out to Jota. Jota dummies the cross. There's the step over, left-footed high, floated ball. Jack O'Mackess up so high, heads it back across goal. Courtois makes the catch. Jack O'Mackess penalised for a foul. Conomack-Namara watching Sevilla against Manchester City. Still Sevilla, Manchester City, wonderful. It's just pulled another one back, looking for Harland. It's been put out for a corner. Sevilla have had their best chance of the game. Papu Goli stretching, couldn't trouble Edison. It's Sevilla, City 1. AC Milan equaliser. Alexis Salamakers with it against Salzburg. That's Salzburg 1. AC Milan 1. Schachtar in this group still one up away to RB Leipzig. As Conom was saying, Manchester City leading Sevilla by Goulton. The expressive nature of Carlo Ancelotti, so annoyed with his team. I'm not quite sure what it was playing out from the back, but it's a giant clap of the hands, and the arms are thrown up in sort of operatic despair. Cross in from Carvajal, chested down by Jens. Callen McGregor head up all the time, looking for the early pass forward. It's not on, back it comes to Karta Vickers. Nil Nil. I'm just thinking about the cross from Jiranovic, not the last one, the one before it. It goes to the back post, and it's something that's silty, more often than not, the opposite wide man gets in and puts that in the back of the net. Jota's on his heels, if he goes and attacks it, then he's got a great chance. McGregor floated ball, chested down by Jota. The offside flag goes up late there. Play was allowed to develop, then it goes up. Jota was offside from the original ball, and once he back healed it to Matto Riley, the flag went up and the pre-kick is given to Real Madrid. We have a minute left in this first half. Kelly Cates back with you at half time, keeping you in touch with everything that's been going on this evening. Five live and BBC sound. This is Celtic Nil, Real Madrid Nil, Kroos on the ball inside his own half towards Hazard. Nearly got away from him. McGregor sticking to him like glue, plays back to Alaba. Alaba across to Militao. Militao to Carvajal, walking pace from Real Madrid inside their own half. Not really had too many stoppages in the first half. I wouldn't expect too much added time at the end of this 45 minutes. Luca Modric, always reminded of that goal. He scored, breaking Scottish arts against Scotland at Hamden Park in the Euros. That was a wonderful classic. I've just got all over that one. Sorry, Jack. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Carvajal on the right, low ball to the edge of the Celtic box. Tua Mayny lays it off, Hazard drives a low pass to Venetius Junior. Right footed, Kirlis straight at Johar, pass it down into the ground, one minute of added time at the end of the first half. And again, Celtic are going to go quickly. Johar slings it out, Schmeichelstahl over on to Abad. Abad can't quite get past Tony Kroos. Kroos stops him and the ball comes back to Alaba. What a first half it's been. It's been incredible. Absolutely incredible. The noise at the start, the start for Celtic. Real Madrid have had the moments, the chances Celtic created. It's been absolutely brilliant. And everything we expected, more apart from, we've not seen too many goals. But as long as we look when the Celtic end, we'll be all right with that. Last chance in the first half, possibly for Real Madrid. Venetius Junior, Celtic defenders trailing in his wake, but they've got him heading backwards towards the halfway line. 10 seconds remaining on the clock in the first half. Will Real Madrid sling across in there? Valverde with a couple of tricks on the right-hand side. It's not really their style. They've not really got the target man either, with Karim Benzema going off injured at half-time. Carlo Ancelotti, not best plays with his team. Another throw of the arm in the air. The European champions have come to Celtic Park and James McFadden, they know they're in a fight. Oh, they sure do. Carlo Ancelotti's frustrated, we say, but I think, Fred, it has to go to Celtic and how they've played and how they've approached it. Pressing, when it's on, sitting back, frustrating. Alowing Real Madrid possession of the ball, allowing them to go side-to-side, ensuring they've looked dangerous in certain occasions, but overall, I think Celtic will be really happy with how that first half's gone. Half-time thoughts from Ruddy Poseid. Well, I'm looking at the possession stats. Celtic have 57% of the possession, that's their lowest share this season. The only other team who finished a game with greater possession than them was Rangers on Saturday, and Celtic took care of business when they needed. At the moment, also, by the way, two shots on target, plus hitting the post. Yeah. There's a feeling on that, too, because Real's only chance on target came right at the end of the half. Can Celtic keep it going in the second half? Carlo Ancelotti, this is his fourth visit to Celtic Park. He doesn't like it, he's never won. Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil. James, this is such a fun game to watch. It's end-to-end, it's really entertaining, and as much as, you know, Ruddy was right to say, with just over 30% of possession for Celtic, but it seems to feel like every time they've got the ball, they're going forward. Yeah, and that is it. You know, Celtic, when they play against, you know, and domestic teams, they have majority of the ball because teams are sitting off, they're not committing to the press, so they're patient, and they have to try and look for those gaps, try and invite the press. But as Ruddy mentioned, against Rangers, Rangers went to go and try and have a go at Celtic, and they just sat off at times as well, and allowed, I wouldn't say they allowed them comfortable possession, but when Celtic went it back, two, three, four, five passes, and they're getting a chance at goal because of the speed in which they attack, the numbers they throw forward, and how quick they play the ball forward when it's restarted, they want to play and put teams under pressure. They're not going to have the majority of possession against Real Madrid, because they know how to take this thing out of the game, but I would say that Anshborst of Corg Lugl will be absolutely delighted with how this first half's gone. They've had the best chances in the game, they've hit the post, and yeah, Real Madrid have looked at a class at times in terms of not having a ball about, but not really testing Joe Hart, Vinicius goes in down the left-hand side, Joe Hart does really well, there's another shot from distance, but apart from that, I think they'll be really happy. The frustration for Celtic is they haven't been able to take one of those chances, but when they've been on the ball, they've used it the way they normally do, and that is all the Celtic fans, Anshborst of Corg Lugl, the players, it's all they can ask for, because they promised them they would approach the game in the same manner as they should do every single week, and they certainly have done that. It is very much Anshborst of Corg Lugl's ethos on the pitch at Celtic Park tonight. We'll be back there for the second half with James McFadden, Roddy Forsythe, and Alistair Bruce Ball very shortly. Also half-time in Seville, it's Sevilla against Manchester City, Conor McNamara. Yes, it's been comfortable for Pep Guardiola's side, they lead by a goal to Nill here, it is now 11 goals in his last seven games for Manchester City for Erling Haaland, sliding in, tapping it in, looks so easy. Of course, the genius is how he got into that position how he gave the defenders the slip. Kevin De Bruyne, perfectly timing a run to stay onside, getting on to Phil Foden's pass, low and hard across the goal, and Haaland there to tap it in. So, 20th game for Haaland in the Champions League in his career, he loves this competition, he's now scored 24 goals in those 20 games. At this level, it's just incredible. Sevilla promised much in the opening minutes, they were a flurry of passes, they were confidently coming out from the back, but they haven't delivered much. Marcus Secunia, the Argentinian midfielder, and a crack from the edge of the box, but it went across the face of goal and narrowly wide. It is Sevilla Nill, Manchester City won. Conor, thank you very much, Conor McNamara, I'll bring us regular updates from that game. England are taking on Luxembourg in the qualifiers for the World Cup, England have of course already qualified with that win against Austria in midweek, but Serena Wiegman said they weren't going to take their foot off the gas for this one. So how many is it now, Gary Flintoff? Well, we've played an hour, Kelly, it's England 7, Luxembourg 0, and I have to say, very popular goal, just scored by Nikita Paris. Good run on the right-hand side, neat 1-2 into the penalty area, and she finished low past the keeper's right hand. And as expected, the changes have come three at half time with Zellem, as the goalkeeper makes another save. Zellem, England and Bright coming on for Williamson, Stamway and Russo, and Hemp and Stokes have just replaced Daly and Mead, as Serena Wiegman makes changes and starts to experiment England in control, as you would expect by seven goals to nil. Gary Flintoff, thank you very much, Gary will keep you up to date with that, and Laura Bassett and P. Mirlenstein will take you through that on Sports Extra if you want to listen to full commentary. Elsewhere in terms of the World Cup qualifiers, Wales are drawing nil-nil against Slovenia, Wales need a point to make the playoffs, it's going well for them as things stand. Earlier Scotland made it six against the Faroe Island, six nil was the final score there, and Northern Ireland beat Latvia in Latvia by three goals to one. Elsewhere in the Champions League this evening, John Bennett, it's been entertaining, it's been eventful. We've seen some fantastic goals, two of them in Paris, both scored by Kylian Mbappe. Half time it is Paris Saint-Germain 2, Juventus nil, the first goal will be sending social media wild, a scoop pass by Neymar into the box, and Mbappe volleyed it in, his second goal was a volley as well, this time set up by Hakimi, Paris Saint-Germain playing some superb football. Elsewhere in Celtics group, there's a really good story developing in Germany, RB Leipzig nil, Schachtar Donetsk won, it's incredible that Schachtar are able to compete in the Champions League, given what's going on in Ukraine, let alone to be winning this game at half time a bizarre goal. Marian Schved hitting it into an empty net after he dispossessed the goalkeeper who was well out of his box, but they're one nil up Schachtar Donetsk. And finally in Chelsea's group half time, it's Red Bull Salzburg won, AC Milan won, Milan with an equaliser, after another brilliant goal, Noah Oka 4 with two nutmegs as he hit the back of the net, but it's Salzburg won, AC Milan won. John, thank you very much, John Bennett keeping an eye on all things Champions League this evening. There is a match towards the bottom of League one as well, Forest Green Rovers, one nil up against Aquington Stanley. We'll keep you up to date with all of this evening's football, but for now we're going to head back to New York, the quarterfinals are underway at the US Open, and David Law is watching. And we know who our first men's quarterfinalist is, that's going to be Casparud, who also reached the final of the French Open a few months ago. He's from Norway and he defeated Matteo Berettini of Italy, a Wimbledon runner-up of last year. Terrible start to the match for Berettini, he only won two games in the first couple of sets, got himself back into it, but rude eventually won through in four sets, and will now face either Nick Kiriosl, Karen Hachanov in the semi-finals. We also got the first of the women's quarterfinals going on at the moment, Once Gibur, a runner-up at Wimbledon this year, 5-3 up first set against the woman who knocked out Serena Williams at this tournament, that's Ayla Tomlanovic. 5-3 Gibur, it is and now our advantage to Tomlanovic. David Law, thank you very much. Live commentary from Flushing Meadows is available on the BBC Sport website and app. Coming up, we will of course be back at Celtic Park for the second half of Celtic against Real Madrid, really entertaining first half, but no goals as yet. Regular updates from the Champions League as well, and from England's World Cup qualifier against Luxembourg where the Lionesses are rampant and in stoke this evening. We'll also be live in Naples with Ian Dennis, ahead of Liverpool's Champions League opener tomorrow. Before all of that though, the BBC News with Lucky Bone. Listen on BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thanks Kelly, Liz Truss is appointing ministers to her first cabinet as Prime Minister. Earlier she delivered her first speech from outside Downing Street, saying she had three immediate priorities for her government, to grow the economy, tackle the energy crisis, and improve access to the NHS. So who will be helping her in trying to deliver on those priorities? Her political correspondent Ioni Wells is outside Downing Street. Ioni, who have the big jobs gone to? Well, some of the top jobs as you say have already been announced. We know that Kwasi Kwateng is going to be the new Chancellor, that Suella Braverman is going to be the new Home Secretary, James Cleverly going to be the new Foreign Secretary as well. Nadine Zahawi as well, still remaining a Cabinet Minister. He's going to be the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, which is essentially responsible for running the Cabinet Office and supporting the Prime Minister, basically trying to get different departments and government to try and work together better. So that's another sort of key role. We also know Brandon Lewis has gone from being Northern Ireland Secretary to Justice Secretary as well. So a couple of key big names there as well. Health Secretary going to Therese Coffey, who's a close friend and ally of Liz Truss as well. She's also going to be Deputy Prime Minister. Now one key appointment as well is Wendy Morton. Now people may have not heard that name before, but she is going to be the new Chief Whip, which is a very important role, essentially tasked with making Tory MPs vote the way that the Prime Minister wants them to vote in key things, but also in charge of things like MPs welfare and party discipline more generally as well. Now she is the first Conservative woman to hold that post. So that's something that has been noted. It's previously been held by men in the last couple of governments, certainly as well. Lots of people commenting on the sort of diversity of those top jobs too. Not a single white man is going to hold a position in those four great offices of state. So another sort of top line to come out of this evening's appointments. And you mentioned allies there. What about the MPs who backed her opponent Rishi Sunak for the top job? How have they felt? So far not very well at all. And that is something that is being picked up on in political circles among MPs that did back Rishi Sunak other leadership candidates in this race. Now if this goes the way that we expect it to go, there could still be last minute changes or kind of grappling over certain roles. But so far the only person tipped to be in a cabinet position who backed Rishi Sunak is Michael Ellis, who's tipped to be Attorney General, a legal advisor for the government. But so far no other Rishi Sunak supporters are being given top roles. Now where that could kind of prove problematic is this is something Boris Johnson was known for as well, kind of pointing key allies to those top cabinet positions. Where it may prove problematic though is that there have been calls over the last 24 hours for unity after what's been quite a bruising contest full of lots of blue on blue attacks within the Conservative Party. So there are some of his allies wondering why there aren't more of those positions being offered to Sunak supporters who could potentially then think about stitching some of those wounds back together. Ioni, thanks very much. In other news, the Scottish government has announced a series of measures to help people struggling to make ends meet. They include a freeze on rents for both social and private tenants and a temporary ban on evictions, Kelly. This is Five Live, your football station. The UEFA Champions League with Kelly Cates. And we will have second half commentary of Celtic against Ray El Madrid very shortly. Tomorrow we've got back-to-back games for you. Ajax against Rangers at 5.45 and Napoli against Liverpool at 8 o'clock. And on Saturday, Premier League afternoons on Five Live are back and bigger than ever. Listen to that roar. All the goals as they go in. Quicker than anything else you will find anywhere. That frenetic Five Live goal service. Stuff it. Just give me the team. He's a miserable lump. Oh, they've scored! On the wood! That really is rubbing it in now. Wow, taking all that in. Big game. Top on the guess who's muscled himself in. It's always a delight to be with you on a Saturday afternoon. Have you know who he really enjoys? Who outmanned it. Can you believe that? Just listen to that noise! It is. Oldham Five, Forest Green Five. Let's deal with the big story of the week then. You met Arnold Schwarzenegger. I mean, I didn't really know what. Is it Hello Arnie, how are you? I'm Arnie Scherer from Newcastle. Now, what about this? Christian Ericsson has just scored his first goal since his return. They're rattling in the goals and they're racking up the point. Rodrigo steps up and saves Jose Sardar the runway. Did Manchester United any chance? No. Thank you very much for the young bit. We'll see you next week. The goalkeeper has run 100 yards upfield to celebrate with the rest of his teammates. There's a metric called expected goals. Have you looked into that at all? I haven't looked into that now. I've looked into that for the first question. I really am enjoying working with you. It's going to be a long afternoon, isn't it? That was Mark Chapman and the voice of Saturday, Ian Dennis joins us now from Napoli. Buenos Aires, you're in a tunnel. Buenos Aires, ladies. It could be a long night for you if this cuts out. We've just left the stadium. We're just going into a tunnel on the chaotic roads of Naples. Having had a listen to Alison and Joerke and Klopp for about half an hour and then trying to flag down a taxi for another half an hour. What did they say? You've had plenty of time to mull over it. Are there any fit midfielders for Liverpool? Yeah, Thiago is trained today. It was his second day of training. So he's ready according to Joerke and Klopp. Curtis Jones hasn't travelled. Cavalio hasn't travelled. He's got a dead leg. Curtis Jones has just had a bit of a setback. But there's no Jordan Henderson. And the results of his scallop come back. And Joerke and Klopp is now predicting that Jordan Henderson won't be available until after the international break. So there's mixed news. But Thiago being back and also Cortarta who they signed last week on loan from Juventus, he is ready to play. He needs minutes. So he's ready to play. But Joerke and Klopp have said he's not ready to to fulfill a whole 90 minutes. So I'm expecting him to feature at some stage. For the players in the Premier League who are in European competition, they're going to be playing every midweek from now until the World Cup. So how does that impact on Joerke and Klopp's ability with the injuries to keep his players rotated and fresh? Well, it was one question I wanted to ask him. Because as you're right, it's the condensed nature of this group stage schedule now because of the World Cup. So they're going to have the six games being played in an eight week period. However, I was unable to ask the question because an Italian journalist, he was in great mood. He was very relaxed. He was smiling throughout. But one Italian journalist asked the question about his naples of safe city. And he really did bristle at that. And he responded by saying, that's an embarrassing question. I don't live in Naples. I don't live in Naples. You told me, you know, I'm not going to make your headlines for you. The reason that the Italian journalist asked the question is that Liverpool as a football club have today put out some safety advice for their supporters traveling to the game, not to wear colours, to stay close to the hotel, and not to make their own way to the stadium. There have been issues in the past with not just Liverpool fans when they've come here to Naples. So that was why the question was asked. But Jürgen Klopp at that point then ended his press conference. And we will end our conversation here as well. Then, good to hear from you. I like that kind of slightly old fashioned, old school retro way of speaking to us from Europe. Down a crackly line. It takes me back to the early stages of the European Cup. Now, last time Rangers reached the group stage of the Champions League was in 2010. They take on Ajax tomorrow. Vicki Sparks and Pat Neven will bring you commentary of that from 5.45. And there's lots more from our teams in Naples and Amsterdam on a special Football Daily Away Days podcast. That's available later tonight. And then when you check BBC's sounds in the morning, you'll be able to do that. We'll give you up to date with all things Champions League this evening, our commentary matches at Selhurst Park, with you for the second half. James McFadden and Alistair Bruce Ball. Kelly Cates, you could not have timed that any better. The whistle blows. The second half is underway. Change made by each manager at halftime. We hope this game continues in the vein. It was running in the first half. Hugely entertaining goalless draw so far. One of the Japanese, one of Celtics Japanese contingent, Dyson Maida has come on wide on the right-hand side in place of the young Israeli Lille Abarda. That is the change for Celtic. And change at centre back for Real Madrid. Someone you might recognise, actually, we're in the number 22 first season at the club, having joined on a free from Chelsea. Antonio Rudiger plays alongside David Alaba. Edair Militão has gone off. England's women up against Luxembourg in the World Cup. Qualifying, another goal, Gary Flintoff. Yeah, 8-0, Elatun from the spot. England's second penalty of the night. A cheeky finish, sending the keeper the wrong way. England 8, Luxembourg 0. Thank you, Gary. Tua Mayny on the ball for Real Madrid. Here's Rudiger getting some early touches. He's going to have to battle against Georgios Jakoumakis. Celtic's Greek centre forward, Kiyogo, having picked up the early shoulder injury in the derby on Saturday. He's waiting there on the bench. We'll have to wait and see whether he gets any game time tonight. So great to have the Champions League back on five live in BBC Sounds. And this, as a first commentary, has been a real treat so far. The atmosphere just sort of steadily building early in the second half as the two teams just try and get back into those rhythms they had in the first half. James or McFadden, bring you in in a second, because Val Verde is on the turn here. He has been dangerous for Real on the right-hand side. McGregor's done some brilliant ball winning for Celtic. He's done it again there. Plays it up to Jakoumakis, holds off Tua Mayny brilliantly. Jota sliding the pass through to the substitute Mayida, lays it back to Jota. He's 30 yards out in the inside left channel, wide to O'Reilly. Early ball, chested it down by Yuranovic, drives it across goal. Oh, Mayida's misquoted. Easy save for Kortor. Proper contact on that. Celtic would have had the lead. What a chance it is. What a chance that is for Celtic. Jakoumakis is brilliant to hold the ball up. Then the break, Jota plays it to Mayida, who plays it back to him. It comes down the left-hand side. And when it's crossed back across to the right, it's fired across. Mayida just needs to get a good contact on it. It looked like he was going to score. It just gets stuck under his feet and rolls to the relieve table, Kortor and goal. That really should have been a goal for Celtic. It shows you that not quite everything and post-acoglued touch turns to goal, because that would have been an absolutely inspired substitution had Mayida been able to stick it away. The better chances in this game, as they were in the first half going to Celtic, Real Madrid lost Kari Mbensimartu, injury in that first half. He hobbled off. Aidan Hazard is playing as their centre forward, sort of false nine. Next break in play, we'll take you back to Seville. Conor McNamara bringing us the updates on Sevilla against Manchester City. They're leading 1-0 at halftime through an early Harlan goal. Yet another one of those. 5.30 commentary on Saturday, by the way, on BBC Radio 5 Live Manchester City against Tottenham. Should be some game. Valverde finds space down the right. Hazard onto the ball, little cutback, not enough on it. Carvajal in and Jens knocks it out for a throw-in. And then Celtic's defenders complain that there should have been an offside flag up, because Hazard was in eight as a space on that ride. But the flag stayed down. Obviously, it would have been checked by BAR had it led to a goal. Valverde away from Hattate. Tua-Maini with the shot. Maide is in there to make the block for Celtic. Comes back out to Carvajal. Here's Modric. Modric to Tua-Maini, short ball forward. Can't find Hazard. Hattate trying to dribble out of a tight spot. Tua-Maini is leaning over in much the taller man. Hattate drags him out to the left, gives them all away. Carvajal's pass infield, headed away by McGregor out to the left. Tarté tries to keep it in, does so, somehow gets it to Taylor with a little hook pass. Yens clears with his right foot. Modric works it back to the halfway line, and Rudiger comes back to David Alaba. Jacomacus chases him into the Real Madrid half. Now you can hear that atmosphere building just a little bit more, and Real Madrid come back to goalkeeper Tebow Courtois. Courtois with his left foot drills it out to the right wing. Carvajal chests it down. Carvajal back to Rudiger. Ancelotti shakes his head below us, still not happy with what he's seeing from the European champions so far tonight. Modric sees a lot of space for Fael on Mendi, the left back, bringing it forward for Real Madrid in his bright orange boots. Deflection on the cross, back to Joe Hart. And let's get to Seville. Conor McNamara. Yes, a still severe nil match as to City 1, but City have had two big chances in quick succession. Debrunno played through 1-1, denied by the goalkeeper Pony, and then Harnett stretching, but couldn't get a touch with the goal in his mercy. Sevignal City won. Real Madrid win the ball off Celtic inside the Celtic. Hart, Modric gets his head down, runs forward, little step over edge of the box, plays it to Venicius Jr. Great tackle on him by Moritz Jens, and suddenly opens up for Celtic, four on four. Options for Matto Reilly left and right. Decides not to release the ball, Valverde chases him back. Now you run of it quickly up in support, speeding away down the right-hand side for Celtic in the green and white hoops, attacking the goal to air. Left-hand side as we look at it in this second half. Ptate looks for the run of Maeda. Maeda is so busy at both ends of the pitch, and the ball is with Tebo Cordoire. His work rate's incredible. I think it was the right decision by Matto Reilly not to play the pass. It did look like it would have been a good race between Maeda and Mende, but I don't think it was the right option. I think he'd done the right thing, but then a tactic goes and tries to thread that through. But Maeda will bring endless amounts of energy. He's got one speed. It is very, very fast. He just goes non-stop, and he will be a nuisance. Great threat going forward. Unbelievable work rate going back the way as well. Played over five minutes in the second half at Celtic Park. You're listening to it live on BBC Radio 5 Live, also available on the BBC Sounds app. You don't have to miss a thing if you're on the move. Two more Champions League commentaries tomorrow, as Kelly was telling you at halftime. He and Dennis sounded like he was bobbing up and down in the water, under water and above the water, as he was reporting from Naples. That's our eight o'clock tomorrow night. Liverpool away to Napoli, 545. Rangers back in the big time away to Ajax. Modric, pass forward, intercepted. McGregor on the ball for Celtic, having a great game tonight. Very nearly gave Celtic the lead. That pass forward, Jota can't catch it. Your Celtic line-up then, second half. Johart in goal. Yuranovic, Kartavikas, Jens and Greg Taylor back four. McGregor with O'Reilly and Hatate either side of him. Maidas come on for Abadah, wide on the right. Jota on the left and Georgios Jakomakis through the middle. Real Madrid have Tivo Kortuar in goal, dressed all in red with the giant black gloves away to our left. Carvajal on the right-hand side. Rudiger on to partner Alibar at centre-back. Mendiat left-back on the yellow card. Here is Carvajal, left-footed ball. Valverde's got to work to keep that in play. Can't do it. He falls skids off his right boot into the advertising hoardings. Celtic have a goal kick. Ben Zemar replaced by Hazard in the first half. Venetius Jr. and Valverde either side of him. And in midfield, Tua Mane, Modric and Kroos. Ben Fika, who would have started favourites for the game tonight, have a goal against Maccabee. Haifa, that's in Champions League Group H. And Baphe scored two in the other game in that group. PSG, Lidia Ventus by two goals to Nel. Atate, right in the middle of the Real Madrid half. They're in dark black change kit this evening, with luminous green trim. The last time they were here, back in 1980, 42 years ago, they played in all blue, rather unusually for Real Madrid. So not in the famous white, but you can obviously see the potential for the clash with lots of white in Celtic's kit as well. McGregor's pass across the Real Madrid half. Hazard, half-intercept, he comes back to Carter Vickers. McGregor to Greg Taylor in central midfield, the left back. Wide it goes to Yiranovich, quickly gets it out from under his feet. Kirling Cross looking for Jackamakis, cleared to Hazard. Hazard lays it back to Kroos. Kroos to Mendi. Mendi runs away from Maida. Strokes a lovely pass into the feet of Modric, quickly onto Valverde. Good challenge on him, tackled by Greg Taylor, and out it goes for a throw into Real Madrid. James McFadden. It just looks so good when Modric passes the ball, and it's so relaxed, outside of the birds. Casuals you like, inch perfect weight. He is a role-roist of a footballer. It's a joy to watch. It's another one, isn't it? They applauded Benzemaar up in the first half, but if you're a Celtic fan to watch Modric's live against your team... Yeah, as long as he doesn't do what he did against Scotland in the summer, because that was the same. He was absolutely outstanding in that game, and he'd come in for a lot of sticking the Euros. Said his legs had gone, and he responded well. Obviously goes on to win another Champions League as well. He's just such a terrific footballer. Yeah, as I said in the first half, 37 years old on Friday, improving with age. Former Tottenham Hotspur, they're in Champions League action tomorrow. John Murray will be there for updates on Tottenham against Marseille. Joe Hart, that's a nice ball, floated to the right. Yuranovic, freedom of Celtic park, charges forward, crosses the halfway line. Maida stays wide for him in his yellow boots, in his bald head. O'Reilly with the first-time ball, looking for Yuranovic. Can't find him, and through it comes to Courtois. Now Celtic feel that Courtois shouldn't have been able to pick that ball up. The referee clearly feels that it was accidentally deflected back to him, so he's allowed to. Yeah, I agree. I don't think he was trying to pass it back. I think he was trying to cut the pass out. But it's still on risk from Courtois, he did it. He didn't have to pick it up. He's taking a rest there, but I think it's the right decision. Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, talking about that European Cup quarterfinal in 1980. One of the BBC Scotland team was digging through the loft the other day, found a programme from the game. So I managed to take a photo of that programme, at Laurie Cunningham of Real Madrid on the front cover, alongside tonight's programme as well. 42 years between the games, only the second time these two famous clubs have met in competitive European competition tonight. It's nil nil, and Celtic are pressing, and Maida is trying to hassle Alaba out of possession. England's women leading Luxembourg by eight goals to nil. commentary continues on five sports extra. Carvajal on the ball for Real Madrid. Celtic again chasing them down. Valverde flicks it round the corner, has our chest sit down. Valverde with his pace away down the right-hand side. No options really in the middle. Joranovic got to get across the cover. It's one nil! Venetius Jr. pops up at the far post. The man who scored the winner in the final in Paris in May runs off to the corner flag, does a little jig in front of the Celtic fans to taunt them. Deadly counter-attacking from Real Madrid, and Venetius Jr. gives them the lead. Celtic nil, Real Madrid won. What a sensational goal it is. Real Madrid look like they're under pressure. They look like they're going to get forced into a mistake. They knock it round the back, and when it comes in, it has a deflux around the corner to Valverde with the back heel, and you know he's got the pace. It gets his head up, he just plays a perfectly weighted pass right across the box, about 14 yards out for Venetius to run on. It doesn't even check his run, opens up the right foot, passes it back across Johar, into the side net, and a sensational goal is a hammer blow for Celtic. But listen to the reaction of this crowd. They're trying to fire the players up to say they're still behind them, they can get back level. Yep, was always going to be the way. Real Madrid were always going to offer the threat. They have got the lead. We know how Celtic are going to react, and the fans are going to back them all the way. Another goal in Seville, Conor McNamara. And another goal for Manchester City, who leads Seville by two goals to Neal now. Phil Foden chopped, turned three times in the penalty area before rolling it into the bottom corner. Wonderful individual goal. Halland got the first one. Seville, Neal, Manchester City, two. Juventus have a goal back away to Paris-Sajamard. Paris-Sajamard, two Juventus, one. Manchester City, two goals to the good, good start to the Champions League. Campaign for them, Chelsea. Lost one Neal away to Deidre Mozar. Grappatate nearly gives the ball away. Hazard was very close to getting on to that with a clean run-through on goal. Couldn't quite get it. Carter-Vickers on to the ball. There was a slight delay in kick-off, where obviously the video assistant referee was just checking that the Real Madrid goal was OK, looking for a potential offside. Valverde is so dangerous down the right hand side. Didn't look like he had anyone to aim at in the middle, but Venetius was bombing on down that left hand side. He just put it into the space, didn't he, James? Yeah, I thought he was actually going to run towards goal, but it's great play against his head up. He sees Venetius in the far side, and it's just a perfectly weighted pass in his path, taking out the full defence, and what a finish. Such a composed finish from Venetius Jr. Leipzig won, Schachtar-Denietzk two, I think if I heard that correctly, and Ben Fika now leading Maccabi-Hyper, no, two-two, is it? Two-nil, sorry, Ben Fika leading Maccabi-Hyper, two-nil. He went one-nil early in the second half. So Ben Fika had two goals to the good. You may have a goal back against Paris Saint-Germain, and Leipzig won, Schachtar-Denietzk two, a late. Salzburg won AC Milan, won, and Borussia Dortmund three-nil winners against Copenhagen earlier on. That, again, in group G, which is Manchester City's group, because of course commentary next week, Manchester City against Dortmund, Erling Haaland against his former club. So let's see if Celtic can get back into this one. Coming up to the hour mark in the game, Celtic-nil, Real Madrid won. There was that sort of roar of noise to encourage Celtic to get back into it. Real Madrid are trying to sort of kill that and stem it by keeping the ball and quiet in the crowd. But you know, Celtic will keep going and will. They've had their chances, and you feel they can create more. Yeah, they can, but I'm just looking at Real Madrid. They've obviously got the lead now, and they have knocked the ball about well. They've been really patient in their build-up play. They've hit in the break at pace. But they won't get frustrated by having to keep the ball. Trouble again for Celtic here. Hazard speeding forward on the dribble up to the edge of the box. Slides it into Modric. Modric onto his left foot, looking to make space for the shot. Outside the right foot, it's in. Goalkeeper, Johar got a hand to it. He couldn't keep it out. The European champions showing their class. Bang, bang! In the second half. Celtic-nil, Real Madrid 2. Again, it's a devastating attack from Real Madrid. Knocked the ball about, nice and patient. It comes into Hazard. They get it on the turn, takes a couple of players out. Modric's making that overlap down the right-hand side, and Hazard just waits to the perfect moment, plays it in front of him. It looked like Modric was going to hit it first time when he's right foot chops inside. I think Jens gets a totter, but he just can't quite clear it, and then he puts it on the outside of that right boot. And you know, in that position, it's hitting the back of the net. Johar did get a touch there, but it's an incredible finish. It's an incredible move again from Real Madrid. We were talking about it, the goal against Scotland, the outside of the right foot from closer range this time. Modric, he thought the chance had gone, just whipped that right foot at the ball. Lovely connection with the outside of the right boot. And Johar made a fabulous attempt to try and save it. Got a hand to it, but it's ended up in the back of the goal, and there you go. I think it's two goals in the space of three or four minutes there for the European champions. That is why they are the European champions. Yeah, four minutes. Finishers Junior in the 56th minute. Luca Modric in the 60th minute. Carlo Ancelotti might finally enjoy his glass of red wine post-match after a visit to Celtic Park. Jota plays the ball down the left-hand touchline, looking for Taylor, intercepted, and it'll be a throw-in to Celtic. It's just clinical class attacking from Real Madrid. Yeah, as I did say in the first half, you wonder if, you know, not taking those chances for Celtic would come back to haunt them. And it has. You know, they started the second half well again, but Real Madrid just showing their class and, you know, the quality and the attacking threat. It's just sensational football. And when it comes back, even the one with Modric's there, Johar probably is 90% sure he's going with the outside, he's right-butt, into that side. So he can have an educated guess at it, and he reads it well, but it just shows you how good he is that he's almost telling Johar, I'm going to hit this with the outside and the right-butt, I'm going to put it in the side net and try and save it if you like. He'd done that, got it touched it, but just not enough. Looking worrying for Celtic now, they're giving the ball away again, and Real Madrid really are in the mood. They're leading Celtic by two goals to nil. Hazard plays it to Kroos, back to Tua Mane. Jackamak is chasing back, got a little flick in the eye from Tua Mane, who was trying to sort of hold him off. Celtic have won the ball back. Home fans telling a Tarte to move it on, plays it wide to Yiranovic, and then another pass goes astray, and Celtic have just slightly lost their way, and here's Venetius Jr. dribbling at high speed towards the Celtic defenders, plays it to Valverde. He waves Modric towards him, wants the run on the obla, was going to use him as the decoy, then plays it to Modric, high-floated cross to the far post, headed behind by Yiranovic for a corner to Real Madrid. They're suddenly in cruise control of the European champions. Ladies from Seville, Conor McNamara. It's still Seville at nil, not just to City 2, City of Henrikó, disallowed after filling to two here. Dolberg is coming out attacking on the edge of the penalty area, but City defenders around him, and Phil Ford on the side, but he cushioned the cut to Guggenroth, falling the net on the fly. Savvianil City 2. 17 minutes gone, second half at Celtic Park. Celtic nil, Real Madrid 2. Real Madrid corner, in it comes, in swinger. Dangerously dropping inside the six-yard box, Rudiger looking for his first goal for Real Madrid, can't get on the end of the header. Johard immediately grabs the replacement ball, spins it out in front of him, clears it, long downfield, Maida jumps for it, Modric goes down, holding the side of his head. Maida might get booked for that, in fact, I think he does. And England's women have scored another goal tonight, Gary Flintoff. They have indeed, 9-0, Lauren Hemp, stabbing home from close range. How's they score at 10? Peppery England again, they scored 10. Last time they played Luxembourg, they've scored 10 again. England 10, Luxembourg nil. And at least we got one of the goals on live this evening. Thank you, Gary. Commentary continues on Radio 5, Sports Extra talking, Sports Extra, if the weather allows. Third test against South Africa, England against South Africa, series nicely poised at one all. Starts on Thursday, ball by ball, commentary on Sports Extra, on Test Match Special, the weather forecast for Thursday doesn't look great at the moment, which is a little bit of a concern. Celtic nil, Real Madrid 2, Manchester City 2-0 up, a way to severe, England's women 10-0 up against Luxembourg, in the women's World Cup qualifier. And they've really, Real Madrid, James, about it just taken the sting out of it completely, haven't they? Yeah, they have. They've had a great lift from the goal. And just think what would have happened had Celtic got themselves in front. How much of a lift would they have got? Because it is kind of not the stuffing out of Celtic a little bit. They will continue to pro, but the last couple of times they've had a chance to counter. It's two bodies, two or three bodies. Usually it's four and five and they look at real threat. And naturally it is going to happen, but Real Madrid have responded excellently. They're going in front. They've knocked the ball about well. They look devastating on the counter attack. Celtic just have to deal with it. Can they get a goal back? So, time left in the game. Can they get a goal back and see if that disrupts the rhythm of Real Madrid? Yuranovich. High up the field on the right-hand side. Maida back to Yuranovich. Kartovic is across to Moritz Jens. Jens with a low pass to Jota wide on the left. Celtic nil, Real Madrid 2. Real Madrid have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League in each of the last 25 seasons. They've never failed to get out of the group stages. They're leading Celtic by two goals to nil. Maida O'Reilly, Celtic trying to build on the right. Real Madrid get in there with Mendy. They should be able to clear it. Celtic goes down. Goal in Seville, Conor McNamara. Another goal for City. Another goal for Erling Hall. It's Sevilla nil, Manchester City 3 now. And again in the poachers position after a low shot was parried by the goalkeeper. Foden drilled it in, Hall and tapped it in. And that is now 12 goals in his last seven games for City. And it's 25 goals in his 20th game of the Champions League. Phenomenal. Sevilla nil, Manchester City 3. Full time at the bet, 3-6-5. Gary Flintoff. Yep, 10 goals to nil. England win. Two goals to Stamway. Two goals for Bethany England. Two millioners to mention. USA next at Wembley. That'll be in the event. England 10. Luxembourg nil. Right, thank you, Gary. So, Real Madrid leading by two goals to nil. Karim Benzema off injured in the first half. Currently third highest goal scorer, along with Lewandowski in the Champions League. You wonder how many Harlem might get, don't you? If he stays fit. Yeah, well, he's a gold machine, isn't he? Comes alive. The belly touches the ball, but he's such a gold threat. And it just panics. He just worries defenders. Just by his presence, you look at the build. He shouldn't be able to do what he does. It should be a cent and a half. It should be a cent and a half. I bet he'd be a good one. Yeah, probably. But he's just such a gold machine. And I said this before the game. He will improve. There is no doubt about it. So that is a scary thought that he will get better. James McFadden former Scotland international with us at Celtic Park. Celtic trying to get back into the game. McGregor, the skipper, bringing it forward wide to Jota. Touch with his left boot, works it back onto the right, drags it back onto the left. Now he gets the cross into the far post. Jackamacus couldn't get there, and he shoved, fell on Mendy in the back. Referee spotted it. And Real Madrid, look at that. Real Madrid defenders sort of celebrating good defensive play and keeping the clean sheet. Diego Dallo, I saw, doing that for Manchester United the other day as well. Don't we sort of associate that with Real Madrid? No, no you don't. But they've made a change at half time and brought, you know, swapped centre-backs over, brought Riddigar on from Militão because Jackamacus was causing them problems. And Celtic are a threat on the attack. There's no doubt about it. So, yeah, they will do that. I think that when it's clipped to the back force and it's Jackamacus against Mendy, you're expecting Jackamacus to go and win it. So, it does well to defend, get the fill, take the pressure off and stop that attack by Celtic. Midway through the second half. Celtic, Niel, Real Madrid, two. Lights on mobile phones being switched on all around the stadium at the moment. They look like twinkling stars in the Glasgow night sky. The support has been terrific. It will be throughout the campaign. They're singing a song about the victory in 1967. Ah, the Lisbon Lions. I walked out of a different entrance actually on Saturday after the four-nil win against Rangers. There is a very simple, framed, quite small photo of that team with the European Cup. It's so simple and effective in the classes. It's a lovely touch and it just reminds you of what the first British team ever to win the European Cup, Manchester United, followed them the year later. Only two members of the squad bore more than 10 miles outside Glasgow. It's an astonishing achievement. It's absolutely incredible. And that will never happen again. A team, you know, you look at the fobs all around the world. Multinational, multicultural. That wouldn't happen again. Tremendous feet. Real Madrid playing a bit of keep ball down the left. Alibar is wide on the left down by the byline, crosses blocked by Carter Vickers and the ball goes behind for a corner. I hear that Kijogo is warming up and getting ready to go for Celtic. Took that awkward shoulder knock early in the Derby on Saturday. Celtic at home to Livingston at the weekend. Kamervinger's going to come on for Real Madrid. And next week, Celtic away to Schachtar De Nietz. They're away games this season in the Champions League because of the situation in Ukraine will be played in Poland. Corner taken and it's rolled back to the goalscorer of the second goal. Luca Modric played wide to the left and McGregor's in there, knocks it into the shins of the Nicious and that will be goal kick for Celtic. They've gone so quickly, they didn't have time to make the changes. They are now going to make the changes. So for Real Madrid, Tsuomani comes off, Kamervinger comes on. So 22-year-old comes off, 19-year-old comes on. That just shows you the talent that France have at their disposal, thinking the World Cup coming up in a couple of months time. Celtic are going to make a double change here, James, as you're scribbling, I'll keep talking. Kiyogo will come on, who's just been a wonderful player for Celtic since arrival last season. Triple change actually, David Turnbull's coming on and Aaron Moyer's coming on, but those changes are going to have to wait. So Angé Poste-Coglu is going to make a triple change. 20 minutes to play, five live sport live at Celtic Park, also available on the BBC Sounds app, Celtic and Real Madrid too. Maida looking for a ball to O'Reilly, intercepted. McGregor's been so good at getting on to the loose stuff for Celtic tonight. Crossy, an O'Reilly looping header, and it bounces harmlessly behind for the goal kick to Real Madrid. So let's see who's coming off. A presumed, Jack and Matt, as well. Well, listen, let's try and go two up top. So Matt O'Reilly is one of them. Do you know what I was thinking about him, James, in the first half? Playing for M.K. Donnes at the start of this year, 21 years old, and here he is tonight, up against Modric and Crows. He's been absolutely sensational for Celtic. I mean, sometimes you watch him, and maybe he doesn't do a lot of eye-catching stuff, but he has been a tremendous sign for Celtic, and as you say, from League One to Real Madrid in a year, it's absolutely incredible. Atate is also coming off, Jack and Matt is coming off for Keogo, back to Seville, Conor McNamara. And we're approaching the final quarter for now, still Sevilla, Niel, Manchester City 3, two goals from Hallant, who's on yet another hat-trick now, and he's got time to do it, Foden got the other for City, and Sevilla, Don and Dostad, they've had a terrible start to the Leningen campaign. They are fourth bottom in the table, yet to win a game, and they're not coming back from this. Sevilla, Niel, Manchester City 3. Celtic, Niel, Real Madrid 2. Celtic having the better chances right up until the point that Real Madrid got there first. That came in the 56-minute modrige with the second in the 60th minute. Real Madrid on the ball. Chelsea losing 1-0 away to Dino Mosa, earlier on today, all the reaction, talking points, debate here on five-life sport, through until half past 10, also in the Football Daily podcast, available for you on the BBC Sounds app tomorrow. With that bonus Champions League away days pod, our two teams in Amsterdam and Naples, ahead of our commentaries tomorrow in the Champions League. Carvajal first-time ball to Modric, Modric wide on the right, in the right-back position for Real Madrid. Still had time under pressure to find the pass, plays it across to Hazard. Real Madrid are just sort of down in third gear at the moment. Quite happy with the lead, quite happy with the possession. Still have the skills of Venetius Jr. wide on the left-hand side. Hazard setting more and more into the game. Loose pass from Camarvinga, the 19-year-old who's on. His hair tied back in a bouncing ponytail. Kroos strokes the pass to Hazard. Little back heel flick to Camarvinga. Camarvinga makes his move down the left. Venetius tries to knock it past Uranavich. He makes the tackle and now all of a sudden it's Real Madrid looking for the quick throw on the left-hand side, thrown in to Hazard. Hazard plays it back to Camarvinga, inside the Celtic half, across to Kroos. You get the feeling that Real Madrid just toying with Celtic a little now. Valverde created that first goal, so brilliantly wide to Carvajal. Real Madrid, James, totally in control up there. Yeah, they are. They're just knocking the ball about and around the back. Just a pass selection and a way to pass. Pass it to the safe side, making the players' minds up for them with the passing. And Celtic are just dropping and dropping. You know that Real Madrid will just flick a switch and the tempo will change, and all of a sudden they'll have an opportunity from it, but they're in so much control at the minute. Modric curling pass down the right. Controlled by Camarvinga, played back to Carvajal. Here's Modric again. Let's the ball run across his body. Plays it to Kroos, close to Camarvinga. 30 yards out, fouled by Jota. Free kick for Real Madrid. Celtic just desperate to try and get that ball back. They are just being outmaneuvered by a superior opponent at the moment. Absolutely no shame in that, and Celtic will fancy their chances. I think they're getting out of this group. Shakhtar Dignets are leading 2-1 away to RB Leipzig. Their squad Dignets got obviously much change because of the situation in their country. Leipzig not having the best of seasons in the Bundesliga. Next week, Celtic away to Shakhtar, Real Madrid at home to Leipzig. Free kick then around Madrid. David Alaba runs over it. Kroos rolls it to Modric. Stops it with his right boot back to Carvajal. Kroos dummies across with his right foot, tries the Modric with the outside of the right foot, quite as accurate. Back it comes to Mendi. Mendi to Modric. Modric just has this game in the palm of his hand, running operations. Kiyogo putting Mendi under a bit of pressure, saw him coming, turned away from him. Little one-two with Tony Kroos. Mendi plays wide to Camarvinga, Manchester City heading for three points this evening. Away to Sevilla leading by three goals to Nill. Harland has two and Foden has the other Valverde. Played wide to Modric. Steady, rhythmic, drumbeat you can hear in the background here at Celtic Park. Ashley in time with the Real Madrid passing. Celtic cannot get a kick at the moment. Camarvinga back to Kroos. Kroos wide to Mendi. Mendi to Kroos. Kroos drives it diagonally, high across to Venetius. He's swapped sides for now. He's wide on the right. Valverde's in a central position. Turns away from Moye, splitting pass to the right. Venetius just keeps it in play. Runs at Greg Taylor, takes him on the outside. Now into the penalty area, still has the ball under his spell. Four green and white shirts around him. Flicks it back to Carvajal. Carvajal to Modric. Modric outside of the right boot. Looking for the run of Mendi. That pass ended up where Mendi should have been. Mendi had to scamper quickly to get there. That's how good Modric is. Camarvinga back to Mendi. It's going to be some goal. I'll tell you if this ball ends up in the back of the net. Celtic fans getting frustrated. Kroos is crossed. Carvajal's knockback. Hazard scores. Unbelievable stuff from the European champions. Celtic could not get a kick. Pull from side to side. Eventually the cross comes in. Wonderful layoff. And Hazard makes it. Celtic nil. Real Madrid 3. Sheer, Klaas. Oh, you called that, Ali. It was a tremendous goal. And if you take it all the way back, they must have had the ball for three or four minutes, which is an eternity when you're chasing it and you're shuffling across and you're trying to put pressure on the ball. Tremendous play from Real Madrid. Vinicius running into the box. They recycle it. They don't force it. Bodies round them. And I mentioned this the first half. They look for that little diagonal for the fullback and for the opposite wide man getting in at the back post. Carvajal gets in there. Squares it across. Simplest finishes for Hazard. It's just a brilliant goal from Real Madrid. And Celtic just can't get a touch of the ball. So what's Celtic do to so many teams domestically? They're having it done to them in this second half. Yeah, they are. They are, you know, as I say, they were looking round, saying Celtic need to try and get a touch of the ball soon because they're just shuffling across. They're trying to put pressure on. Real Madrid are just stroking it about, not forcing it, not forcing it again. Like I said, flick the switch and they're in and go and they're three-nil off. It's incredible football. Jota, volley, cross, Kiyogo on his knee. Oh, got that nearly crept in. Scraped the outside of Courtois post. Immediately Celtic on the attack, sort of hopeful cross from Jota. Kiyogo kind of hit him on the left knee very nearly, went in. Yeah, it was good play. Jota left hand, Kiyogo's strength is his movement. It's absolutely world-class. It does well, we get across the front. It has to improvise, but it has Courtois scrambling. And that is better. Celtic need to try and hit back because I know they're losing three-nil and Real Madrid have been a better team, but Celtic played well in spells of the game. Turnbull, chip ball looking for Kiyogo. It's a straight one, too easy for Courtois to catch. It's beyond Kiyogo. Marco Asensio getting ready to come on for Real Madrid. 13 minutes remaining in the game. Shakhtar-Denietz have a third goal away to Leipzig. Leipzig won, Shakhtar three. Manchester City three-nil up away to Sevilla. Real Madrid three-nil up on Celtic here. Benfica two-nil up on Maccabi-Heifer. Paris-Sajomar peg back off the Mbappe goals in the first half. They lead Juventus by two goals to one. Salzburg one AC Milan one. Chelsea beaten one-nil away to Dino Mosa, Rodrigo the Brazilian who scored those two heartbreaking goals from Manchester City fans in the semifinal second leg last season. He's ready to come on as well. Celtic three-nil down, still coming forward. Yuranovic plays it back to Moy. Quietest it's been inside Celtic Park this evening, but the Celtic fans, I think, have to appreciate. They do, I'm sure, what they're up against. Yeah, there's no doubt they will do. Celtic have been a really good performance tonight. They've just come up short against the holders of this tournament. It tells you how far Celtic have come. They came into this game, they had so much belief and confidence that they could take the game to Real Madrid, that they could cause them problems and they could create chances. They've done that, they've managed to do it, but just at the right moments, Real Madrid have shown their class and this is a team that, as I said, they won the competition last year, many didn't plan to let them do it, but they are a team full of world-class players. Celtic fans are at it again, standing ovation for Luka Modric, who's being taken off with just over 10 minutes to play. Another masterclass from him. I think I've said it a couple of times in the commentary, 37 years old, he's going to be on Friday. Smiling a wink from Ancelotti, what a footballer, what a footballer Modric is, and Venetius Jr. gets a rest as well. Rodrigo plays on the left-hand side. Absolute pleasure to watch Modric live again this evening. Rudiger, a slightly different type of footballer, still extremely effective, back in the right-back position, right-footed curling pass, headed forward by Greg Taylor, Real Madrid leading by three goals to nil, and Kroos plays it out to the left to Mending. Haksabanovich, one of the new signings, the Montenegro. Seyad Haksabanovich, previously at West Ham, joined Celtic in the summer, is going to get a little run-out late in the game this evening. Tomorrow, keep reminding you, on air from Huffbus 5, Mark Chapman in the hot seat, Rangers start the group campaign away to Ajax, and then at 8 o'clock, our commentary live from Naples, Ian Dennis and Jonathan Woodgate will bring you Napoli against Liverpool, with John Murray at the Tottenham-Hotspur Stadium, bringing you Tottenham-Marseille updates. Turnbull, nice pass to his left, a jotter. Little flick from Jotter to beat Carvajal, right-footed curling cross is headed away by Alaba, Aaron Moy, 31-year-old Australian international, stretches for it, plays it to Yuranovic, cut back towards McGregor. McGregor had to fight to win that ball. So does Greg Taylor, does it, gets himself on his feet, plays it to Jotter, can Celtic score a killing shot over the bar? Harper-Charks. That is, and it did get a lot better scrappy, but Celtic are winning the tackles. It comes to Jotter, Dyson Maida just made a run to the back post and it gets his head up and clips it towards the back post. He's all on his own, but Celtic again, hitting back. Man, it's just had the shotters coming off. And it's a chance for the home fans to see their new signing. Yeah, Haksabanovich, 23-years-old, one substitute appearance for the club so far in the lead cup against Ross County, not being rude to Ross County. This is a slightly different footballing experience. Yeah, just a bit, just a bit. But it gives them a chance to go and get a run out, go on the ball, allow the fans to see them. I think they were really excited to root the sore against Ross County. So, yeah, it's a chance for them to see what he's like in this kind of occasion. Rudiger put under a bit of pressure by that throw-in, plays it back to Kortar and says the pressure's all yours. Kortar says, don't worry about it, I'll deal with it. And Kroos loses it inside his own penalty area now, and Rudiger shepherds the ball back to Kortar. So just a slight lack of concentration, a bit sloppy from Real Madrid, but Celtic can't quite take advantage. Eight minutes or so remaining in the game. Celtic well-beaten in the second half, goals from Venetius Junior, Luka Modric and Eddin Hazard. Just reading those names out tells you, you know, the class that Celtic have been up against this evening. Haksabanovich on the ball, needs a bit of support, his bright yellow boost as well. Holds onto it, Kamavinga comes in, clumsy challenge. And Celtic win a free kick wide on the left-hand side. And Celtic have just continued to do what they've done from the start. You know, they're still pushing the full backs forward, they're still trying to attack, they're still trying to, you know, play their way, and it's something that we've spoken about at length. The manager demands that off the players, and they will keep going. It doesn't matter if Real Madrid are still going to hit them on the break, and look dangerous on the counter-attack, Celtic are still trying to find a way. Potentially, however slim it is, back into the game, maybe just to get a goal and get a reward for their good play, but they will continue to play this way, no matter what the score line is. James McFadden with us here at Celtic Park. Celtic, Niel Real Madrid, three. Sevilla, Niel Manchester City, three. At the Ramon Sanchez, piss-one this evening, Erling Haaland looking for another hat-trick, unless he's already been substituted by Pep Guardiola. Jones is just going to have a little flick and a look. Connor Maywell have mentioned it, and I miss it. He's gone off as he's a no-champions league hat-trick. First one for Manchester City for Haaland tonight. He is off. He will face Borussia Dortmund in a commentary next week. Four-one to Schachtar, a way to leipsic. That is some result for Schachtar than yet this evening. So, Real Madrid and Schachtar will be off to a winning start in this group. Courtois has the ball at his feet. The big Belgian chips it out to the left. Mendy controls it, knocks it past Maida, collects it the other side. Again, moving at sort of 75, 80% there. Back to Courtois. Courtois this time decides to go long down the middle. Rodrigo's waiting for that ball to land. He's in an offside position. Flag goes up, whistle blows, free kick for Celtic. Not a single. I mean, Celtic fans, well, a couple possibly. I can see on the far side of the ground leaving. This stadium is still absolutely packed with the team 3-0 down. Yeah, and as much as you don't want to see your team losing, they'll be proud of the performance that the team have put in. Taylor's ball to Haksabanovich is a good one. Haksabanovich in the penalty, a drag-back onto his left foot shoots. Oh, Courtois, what a save at the near post. Haksabanovich tried to beat him for power. Courtois stuck an arm up and made the block. That was so nearly a wonderful goal for Haksabanovich. Now, Wattersby is an unbelievable save from Courtois because it does really well. Haksabanovich looks like he's going to cross at his right, drags it onto his left and just fires at that near post. Courtois just puts up his right hand, the reaction and the power that's strengthening his arm to keep that out. It's an incredible save. Yeah, as if the outfield players, the attacking players, weren't good enough, he's still going to try and beat Courtois as well. Kept that clean sheet for Athletico Madrid at this stadium. Back in November 2011, here he is 11 years on, doing the same for Rao Madrid. So Celtic nil, Rao Madrid 3, terms of your Premier League action on the way this weekend. 3 o'clock commentary on Saturday. Actually, those of us Celtic and Rangers leaning will have spotted it's Brendan Rodgers against Stephen Gerrard. Lester Villers are 3 o'clock commentary. We've got Manchester City Tottenham in full at 1.5, which should be fascinating. Sunday two games, Arsenal-Everton kicks off at 2 o'clock. Crystal Palace Manchester United is on a 1.5 plus 4 commentary. I know Steve Crossman has done an interview with Ben White this morning. You're here on Five Lives Premier League Sunday, which I'm told will be a good listen. Steve appeared on the Fantasy 606 podcast recording this morning. That'll be out on Thursday on BBC Sounds. James tells me he's not playing this season, which is disappointing, because I know he was playing last season, but some other members of the family I think are involved, aren't they? Yeah, my son plays. My two sons play it. I just, according to that many games, I don't have time to be worrying about who I should sob and who my captain is. I understand how it works. I just don't have time to play it. Camarvinger on the ball for Rayon Madrid. Five minutes remaining in the game. Celtic nil, Rayon Madrid three, and Rayon Madrid third goal. Just quite incredible, as James was saying, had possession for three, four minutes without Celtic getting a kick, and eventually picked their moment to score a sensio. Wide on the right-hand side. Just singing starting up again from the Celtic fans. Kroos plays it to Hazard. I think his performance tonight will have done him some good in the goal as well. Yeah, Hazard's looked really sharp. He has, you know, struggled to get into the game at the start, as you couldn't. Layoff. So, a sensio hits the shot to the near post. Johar makes the save. Yeah, you know, Hazard's looked really sharp. He looked like the Hazard of old, and he's having to play in an unfamiliar position straight through the middle as a number nine, but some of his touches have been great. He looks sharp, he looks fit, he looks lean, and that can only be a good thing for Rayon Madrid. And it's great to see you because he's a terrific footballer. Oh, yeah. He's a joy to watch when he's at full flight. Callum McGregor plays to Haksabanovich on the edge of the Rayon Madrid box. McGregor continues the run, gets it back, cut back here to Maida. Had a swing with his left foot, made contact, skewed it wide. Goes behind for a goal kick to Rayon Madrid. Celtic nil, Rayon Madrid three. I'm just going to try and bring Roddy in. What have you spotted Roddy on the BBC Sport website there? Yeah, it's on the BBC Scotland website. 36 years and 362 days. Look at Modric, he's the oldest player to score for Rayon Madrid in the European Cup or Champions League since Berends Pruskas did it in September 1965. And of course, Pruskas is Andrew's former manager. That's right, managed him himself. Melburn also enjoyed a very good night in Scotland, didn't he? Back in 1963 in the European Cup, Rayon Madrid won two of their European Cups in Scotland. The famous win against Eintracht Frankfurt. They pushed for Scott Four that night and Stefano got three. They also won it with the magical Zidane Folly against Leverkusen at Hamden Park in 2002. So there's a big link between the two clubs. Rayon Madrid getting the three points tonight, closing stages of the game here on five live in BBC Sounds, on air through until Huffpust 10. Manchester City getting their win three-nil up away to Sevilla. Chelsea beaten by a goal to nil. And here's Carter Vickers coming forward to Maida. Celtic keep going. Yuranovic, who actually in the last Celtic move, I think must have covered 100 metres down the right-hand side in like 10 or 11. I mean, incredible pace, incredible energy at the end of the game. Firland Mende, lovely ball with his left foot to Rodrigo. Stepping over, right footed. Carter, just wide, could have been four-nil, goes behind for the goal kick. Yeah, could have been in Yuranovic. The man you're just speaking about is on the attack. And he manages to get back just in line as he hits the shot. And Rayon Madrid have looked good on the counter. You know, I have to say, I think Celtic have had as many good chances as Rayon Madrid. They just haven't been clinical. Maida down the right, cross comes in. Max Savanovich trying to attack it at the far post, headed behind by Rudiger, corner for Celtic. Listen to this place. This is the losing three-nil, singing for the manager. That shows you the appreciation these fans have got from what they've seen tonight. Two minutes of added time, the roof will come off. We always say it if Celtic score here. Moise curling ball, Kiyogo looks for the flick on. Tebow Kortua behind him, punches it away. Kamovinger, first-time clearance, up towards the halfway line. Greg Taylor intercepts it, knocks the pass to Haksabanovich, runs into Kamovinger. Play-on says the referee, turn ball. Back to Haksabanovich, all he just tries to slide it to McGregor, gets it there in the end. McGregor, back to Haksabanovich, sliding challenge on him. I think it was a clean one. Alaba takes the ball, referee says, get yourself up, and the ball goes behind for a goal kick to Rayon Madrid. They lead Celtic by three goals to Nile. Do Manchester City have a fourth in Seville? Got a McNamara. They do. Two minutes into stoppage time. Sevilla Nile, Manchester City four. The demolition is complete. Ruben Diaz tapping in from close range after another slick build-up. City many people's favourites to go win the tournament. They are starting in style. Sevilla Nile, Manchester City four. Thank you, Conor. James McFarren has just taken the headphones off just to have a listen in the roar to the noise. Unbelievable support for Celtic, who really were having the better of the chances, right up until Rayon Madrid scored the first. Then Rayon Madrid have taken them apart, but they can do that to absolutely any team. Closing stages of the game, probably about 30-40 seconds to go. Celtic Nile, Rayon Madrid three. Celtic away to Shakhtar next week in their next Champions League game. Here's Valverde, Rayon Madrid keeping it at the moment inside the Celtic half. Flick back to Carvajal, five times Champions League winner. He'll win a sixth. Wow, I got it. That is incredible. This is a full stadium, watching the team lose. Three now, and they are going crazy for the manager. It shows you what this man has done in one year. One year, it's absolutely incredible. The great quote from him yesterday about expectations is, why would I burst people's bubbles? They have enough of that in their normal lives. They come to Celtic Park to be entertained. They've been entertained tonight. In the end, they've been beaten by the European Champions. Absolutely no disgrace in that. Callum McGregor with a rasping shot against the post, could have given Celtic the lead. They had other chances in the game, and then suddenly two goals in four minutes, and Rayon Madrid were away in the second half. Venetius Jr. with the first, Luka Modric. What a fabulous play he is. Obvious thing to say with the second goal to make it 2-0. And Eddin Hazard looking sharp again, got the third. Really entertaining evening of football. And James, I can tell you've enjoyed it, but you've really been struck by this support right at the end for Celtic, haven't you? Yeah, it's been a terrific game, a really good performance. Created really good opportunities, particularly in the first half, unlucky not to go in front. But the crowd have stayed behind to show the support for the team, to show their appreciation for the job that this manager has done for them. You know, he keeps speaking about it, he won't change. He's got to style a football, they won't change from it. They'll approach every game the same, they'll go and take on Rayon Madrid, they'll go and see and test themselves against them. What they'll learn tonight is they're a very good side. They are well on the way. And to get the appreciation and the adulation from the crowd, it reinforces that for them. Terrific performance, just unlucky, our unfortunate sorry to be on the end of a 3-0 scoreline, but this club is going the right direction. And I've never seen so many fans stay this long after the defeat. Rodney Passai, what did you make of it? For me, the turning point was Mayda's mischievous after half-time, because Serti had come out the way they had come out in the first half, they were looking as likely to score. It was harder for him not to score than it was to put it behind Kortwa. That said, look at the fans on that side. Serti, Kortwa, my goodness. And Kortwa. And all of the Tore, they all asked, I was about to say that when we looked at this group when it was drawn, we never doubted that Real Madrid would qualify. Celtic were four seats, it was going to be a hard shift for them, but Leipzig looked vulnerable. They'd been beaten by Rangers in the Europa League semi-finals last season. If Rangers could do it, Celtic felt they could do it. Now the group has been bust open by Shakhtar, Danez, when in Leipzig, and the pressure is on Celtic next week in Poland. Seems strange to say it, and it seems strange to hear it. Celtic have been beaten by three goals tonight, but it's been a very special night at Celtic Park, and we have watched Real Madrid in action, a very special team. 14 times European champions, they've beaten Celtic by three goals to now. James, a clinical performance from Real Madrid. The European champions have come away from...",
