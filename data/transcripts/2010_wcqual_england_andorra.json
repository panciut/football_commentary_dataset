  "transcript": " Well good evening from Apuga to Wembley Stadium. We've just seen half a dozen young men with a banner, a yellow banner which said we had to walk to Wembley. Well they've got here, we've kicked off just over 10 minutes away. Let's talk about David Beckham for a bit. Mark, he's 34, he was 34 last month so he'll be 35 next year if he can get to the World Cup. Could he play age 35 in Central Midfield? I noticed that Fabio Capallo said he played for me at Real Madrid in Central Midfield twice. Well that was not a mod of a re-endorsement is it? No, I don't think he can play there in all honesty. I think it's a case of needs muster. I think we see what will happen with Beckham presuming that he goes to the World Cup market. He will come on as a substitute. I can't put a life in me think that he will start any games and if he does it either means in the first group in the first two matches and decide to give him a game in the third. But no, I think he will be used as an impact substitute or lack of impact substitute, whatever you want to call it. Who should be playing there instead this evening Graham? Were there to be somebody else? Who should play in Central Midfield tonight? I think when you look it's the availability of people and what you don't want to do, I don't think at this stage, is to bring someone in because Carrick's missing, because Barry's missing, that you're never going to use that person again. Do you know what I mean? And that's why I can see some sense in what he's saying. Look, I've got the squad of players. I think it's pretty well near what he sees as his main squad. We moved Gerard about, so Beckham I think is impressed with Beckham's not only fitness, but what he did at Real Madrid when he buckled down and got back. And I think that impresses people like Capello and great credit to David Beckham. So I don't think it's a question of just bringing somebody else in. I just feel that if you're going to play him in Central Midfield, this is the game to play in. And it gives him a game. Mark, I have to tell you, against Andorra, they speak from the House of Commons could play in Central Midfield. Even if he's on his way out. Let's go and make a play. Alan, get on, Mike. What about Gerard Central Midfield and playing right Phillips out wide? Well, that's what I was saying earlier, Mark. Personally, I would rather have... I know he doesn't want to experiment until qualification is absolutely guaranteed. And that's fine. It's highly professional, the attitude. And you can't argue with the record that Capello has brought as England coach. It's exceptional. But tonight, this is a pub team that kicks. Andorra will not win the game. I think it will win the game. Ideally, it will be seven or eight. Probably, it will be two or three. But I would rather have taken an opportunity to see Ashley Young or James Milner, rather than David Beckham in the seven in midfield. I know who Mike was talking to me earlier about what Capello said about Gerard's role in the England team. And that's fine. It's what I sort of half-anticipated. It's actually a compliment to Gerard that he wants Gerard in a forward role. But tonight, I would have played him alongside and seen either Milner or Young. I think the only thing England have to guard against tonight is the fact that all these players go on the holidays in the morning. So sometimes, as Graham will say, if they've got that in their head and wanted to decide to stroll around, it might make it a little bit more difficult. Don't get me wrong, I think England will win. But it might just make it a little bit more difficult than we think it's going to be. Do you think, will the players be slightly concerned about the physical aspect of this game bearing the mind what we saw in Barcelona? Morgay, yeah, definitely. The other thing is, you know, I mean, you can play against good teams that can kick absolutely fine. But when bad teams kick, it's even worse because it's very, very blatant and it's very, very difficult to stop. But if the referee's not particularly firm in this game, it might be a real problem for England. And of course, the last thing is, that's why I made the point before about the players going on the holidays tomorrow. If the flag starts flying, you might get one or two of the players in can hold on a minute. I don't want to get an injury. I don't want to have to stay behind in this country when I should be on the holidays. And the last thing I'm thinking about at the moment is pre-season football. I'm thinking about being on a beat somewhere, wherever you want to go. I think officially, the dirtiest team in World Cup qualifiers, this time around, Andorra, they picked up more yellow cards than any other nation. I mean, I just don't know what the point is of Andorra. You know, I'm all for Minos and the romantic notion behind Minos. But Andorra are deeply unattractive. It's a beautiful little country, but as a football team, they're awful. Well, they were very physical. When I said in Barcelona, in case you got confused, that's where Andorra played England in the first game of this World Cup qualifying campaign. We've just seen on our monitor, Graham Taylor, what about 100 tubes parked up empty, which is why over on the far side, there are sways of empty red seats, which you don't see very often at all. The players are down in the tunnel. Would you, as the England manager tonight, be worried about players getting kicked as simple as that? I can see where Mark is coming from, but I think this manager in charge of the England team will expect a performance and a result in this particular game. And if he doesn't get it, I think he'll be upset. And that might be worse than getting a kick. Was he pretty upset? I got the feeling from missing to you obviously in Almaty when I was at Epsom, that he was pretty out, even though England were two up, he was pretty upset at half time, wasn't he? Well, I mean, I think, and he had every right to be, and you know, he was off into that technical area, the front of the technical area, in that first five or ten minutes, you know, and you could see him really expressing himself, whether they could understand. I think his English is still a little bit better than he lets us know. So he was expressing himself in some very strong terms there. Is complacency the danger here? End of the season, pub team, England six out of six, long season, picky about holidays. Graham and then Tomar, is this a danger complacency? Well, it always is. It adds up and says it is, but I'll tell you what it shouldn't be. If you're, call yourself a professional, get the job done, the season's over, boys, go on holiday. But before you go on holiday, win this game and get it done. Well, the teams are coming out, and this is a very rare sight, because it's actually quite a surreal atmosphere with the ground, well, we've got a sort of overhanging stand above our head, so we can't see how full it is above us. But certainly, I would have thought no more than about half full at the moment. Mark, do you worry about complacency, or are we beyond that with footballers? No, I mean to that complacency angle as well, most definitely, because it's always a day when you're complacent in football that you get injured, Mark, and that was the point I was trying to make before. So, Graham's absolutely right, of course, get the job done. You just might have one or two of the players who just switch off a little bit. Well, the subs this evening, Paul Robinson, Gary Neville, Wayne Bridge, Ashley Young, Sean Wright, Phillips, Jermaine Defoe, and Carlton Cole. Just to tell you a result from Kiev, where England still have to go to, of course, Ukraine 2, Kazakhstan 1, which doesn't really impact upon England tremendously, but Ukraine have beaten Kazakhstan by two goals to one. Hollander in action this evening, interestingly, against Norway. We'll keep you in touch with that, of course, because the Dutch have won their group already, but of course, they would have an impact if they were to beat the Norwegians on the Scots and their attempt, of course, to become runners-up. I was going to say, an important night for Robert Green, but actually, I think you probably tell me that I could play in gold this evening, and I wouldn't have to do a great deal. So, actually, probably from Robert Green's point of view, it's a bit frustrating. You might like a real match to get his teeth into. Yeah, but quite honestly, Mark, I think it is an important game, because I think any goalkeeper will tell you, when you don't have much to do, you must keep your concentration, because that's when you might just lose it. And I don't care what anybody says, you know, yes, making the save, people say this, he's not going to have too much to do, but he must keep his concentration all of the time. So, it is an important game for him. Well, the two teams are just being introduced to the dignitaries here at Wembley, and of course, that goalkeeping position, well, we've got a year to go, and an awful lot can happen in a year, of course, in terms of form, in terms of fitness, so who knows, as everybody here, those who have made it to Wembley stand for the national anthem. Well, there we go, then, we've had the national anthems and kickoff, it's just a couple of moments away. Just time to tell you, I was mentioning Scotland's group there, group nine, that Macedonia have moved level with Scotland in second spot after being Iceland 2-0 in Scotland this evening, it means the Macedonians are now on seven points, along with Scotland, who do enjoy a slightly better goal difference, and have a game in hand of September's match in Scotland. So, there we are, you're caught between this evening, we've got former England manager Graham Taylor with us, Mark Lawrence and Alan Green, and first of all, here's our Chief Football Correspondent, Mike Ingram. Thanks, Mark, good evening. I think I read somewhere today that the last time there was a tube strike, the attendance at the Old Wembley was 15,000. Well, there must be three times as many here this evening, and really well done to everybody who has made such a big effort to be here, probably around about 40-45,000 at the moment here at Wembley on a cool evening. And England have shown today that England have made three changes from the side which played in Kazakhstan. Gareth Barry was suspended, remember, having got his second yellow card. David Beckham starting his first competitive match since the World Cup quarterfinal against Portugal, 112 caps for him now. Peter Crouch replaces Heskey, and Lescott takes over from Upson, and neither Heskey nor Upson are on the bench this evening. The England line-up is Green, his first England international at Wembley, the back four, and it's the same back four that played against Andorra in Barcelona. Johnson, Lescott, Terry and Ashley Cole, then David Beckham, Lampard, Gerard, Wolcott, Crouch and Rooney. Andorra have also made three changes from the weekend. They lost to Belarus at the weekend. Their line-up is Kolder, who's playing for the last time in goal for them tonight, 78 caps. Ayala, the two Lima brothers, Tony Lima and Ildefonse Lima. Tony Lima's also bowing out of the international football scene tonight. Sonoghi, the captain, Zyke Jema, the left back, then Marino, Andorra, they have a player called Andorra playing for Andorra. Vieira, Jimenez and the lone striker Fernando Silva. The referee is from Holland, Hendrikus Nijus, and Pavia Coppalo has lost only two matches so far as England manager. Both friendlies await a France and Spain, and there is a country sandwiched in between those two nations. And they're here tonight, but Andorra, not so much a mountaintop, more a molehill in international football, but Mark Lawrence and 190th in the world, they still have to be beaten. Yeah, they have to be beaten, like just about setting off in the right way, starting at a very, very high tempo, England, then you can always drop down a gear. To do it the other way around is more difficult. England are playing all in white this evening. Andorra, predominantly in red, England will play from right to left in the second, in this first half. Peter Kraut, you've got a couple of goals. The last time England played Andorra in this country, the old Trafford, stands alongside Dwarfing, in fact, Wayne Rooney, who's had such a magnificent season of goal scoring in international football. And away we go, and Pavia Coppalo saying yesterday that really, bearing in mind, he expects all the Andorran players to get behind the ball, England do really need to strike an early goal here. They were frustrated in the two away matches against Andorra, both of them goalless in the first half, and England immediately getting possession, and it's with Frank Lampard, just inside the Andorra half. Lampard plays it along the halfway line to John Terry, and now Glenn Johnson. One of the England players on a yellow card, by the way, in danger of missing the Croatia match. Should he get another one tonight? David Beckins in the same situation. Lescott onto Steven Gerrard. Gerrard playing quite deep at the moment. No Andorran players had a touch yet. Ashley Cole drifts the ball in towards Kraut in the first Andorran to have a touch of the ball as the goalkeeper called straight into his arms. I think straight away, a rune is pushed up alongside Kraut, and we've got Walcott pushed down the right, and Gerrard on the left hand side. So there's almost a front floor for England. Lovely flick from Kraut to send Gerrard going. Here comes Steven Gerrard for England, attacking the Andorra penalty area. Oh, good challenge though, coming in at the back for Andorra by Sonagy. Then as Ashley Cole tries to take possession, he's fouled Marino, and Andorra have a free kick. Well, just for the moment then, it's Gerrard playing on the left. He was more effective in Kazakhstan when he got on the ball and went into the centre. But just at the moment, England are playing a pretty authentic 4-4-2 with Walcott on the right, Beckins and Lampard in the centre, and Gerrard on the left. Yeah, it was an excellent tackle, wasn't it? Free kick eventually taken by Caldo into the England half. Lescott against Silva. Silva gets a touch, but John Terry's waiting to pick up the pieces and sends Walcott now for the first time down the right-hand side. Fabio Capello is saying how important Walcott could be tonight to try and stretch the Andorra defence. Now Lampard with a beautiful ball, some 30 yards to this near side. Controlled by Ashley Cole, who takes a tumble. Gerrard plays the ball into Rudi. Lovely tip from Rudi. Rudi shoots, and the goalkeeper's just turned it over, and it's a corner kick to England over on the far side of the right. Good football from England. Well, as the ball was played into in a little bit of pace, Mike, he just shifted the ball and himself away to the left-hand side. It's all the goalkeeper out and tried to chink him. The first David Beckham corner of the evening, over on the right-hand side. Lampard's lurking on the edge of the penalty area. Lescott's gone forward. Terry as well, but it's headed away at the near post by Vieira for Andorra, only as far as Walcott of England. Walcott now to Beckham over on that right-hand side of the field. Beckham's been given a central role this evening. It's Glenn Johnson of England trying to get the ball into the penalty area. The ball breaks to Walcott. Walcott shoots, and the ball is hit. The ball is here scored. Rudi from no more than a yard out somehow contrives to head the ball against the crossbar when he should have scored for the seventh time in this group. But also the keeper's made a great save from Walcott. Walcott was very, very close in. I think your finger tipped it onto the bar, and it came back off the bar very, very quickly into Rudi. There's an injury to an Andorra player in the penalty area. It's not serious. Bang on the head. Ball is out of play down this near side, and Stephen Gerrard preparing to take a throw. While there are goals there tonight for Crouch and Rooney, certainly throw into England, nil-nil against Andorra, just underway here at Wembley inside the first four minutes. Throw in taken. Stephen Gerrard for England finding Lampard. Lampard now hits it across the field for Johnson. It's all England as you would expect. Johnson's high ball into the area. Rudi will score for England with a header. Ball played in from Glenn Johnson. It's as simple as that. After only three and a half minutes, England have got the goal that Fabio Capello demanded, and for Wayne Rooney, it's his ninth for this international season. Yeah, really quite simple, because the problem for Andorra is they're playing with three centrebacks, and not one of them moved as soon as Rooney moved. Good ball in from Johnson. Nobody moved. Yeah, the easiest of headers, just a knock it past the goalkeeper. I mean, just hit the bar with the previous header as well. Well, as I was saying about there are goals there tonight for Rooney and Crouch, and Rooney could hardly miss that one. England won Andorra nil, and bearing in mind, Andorra hardly ever score. That should just about be game over already, and Andorra have only scored two goals in this group, and both against Belarus. England won Andorra nil, and now less got for England, finding Ashley Cole down the near side. We'll get a word from England's former manager Graham Taylor, who's with us tonight in a moment. Johnson, who put the cross in for Rooney to Walcott. Walcott, was he fouled? Referee says play on. No, it looked like a foul. I need to see a bit more than Walcott tonight. I need to see a bit of robustness. That was Mark Tugetsch, and not Graham. Graham Taylor, can you hear me? Tell us what you think so far. Yeah, I hope it's just laughing there with Mark. I think what it shows is that we can, if England keep playing as they have played in this opening spell, there is the possibility of seeing a double figure win tonight, because Mark is quite right. They're playing 5-4-1 on Andorra, and they're not getting near the ball anyhow, so there's going to be great opportunities to get double figures. Thank you, Graham. Damage limitation already then from Andorra. Trailing here 1-0. Rooney's got the goal. Andorra look for Silver, it's a wayward pass. Terry Clecks, England barely need a back four at the moment really, as Gerard floats a beautiful ball into Ashley Cole's path. Cole checks just inside the Andorra half, lays it back to Gerard. Good movement here from England. Long ball from Gerard to the far side. Walcott waits, brings it down and finds Johnson. Johnson's just really joining all the attacks at the moment for England. England still keep the possession with Lescott. Lampard, back again to John Terry. Nice. England moving it around so much quicker than they did in Kazakhstan in those early stages. Ashley Cole again now, trying to pick out Crouch. Galky, the fist set away, not too clever. That is on the edge of the penalty area, and it'll be cleared by Jimenez, but it's a very hurry clearance out of play for an England throw-in. Mark Lawrence, and that's a poor attempt at stopping the cross from the goal-kick, but he wants to get his gloves dirty. England throw-in taken, and Lescott here again, just a matter of days really since the FA Long ball to the far side, looking for Walcott. Headed away by the left back. Jimenez again once more, easily dispossessed by Johnson, and Johnson's won himself a free kick. Andorra do have a reputation for being quite physical. 19 yellow cards they picked up in this group. The two lemurs, by the way, have already had a suspension. They both had three yellow cards, and it's a free kick, and it'll be David Beckham once more, and Lescott and Terry both in the penalty area. Crouch raises both arms as well. Again, Lampard's lurking on the edge of the box. Beckham legs a stride, prepares to take the free kick. It's England one, Andorra nil here at Wembley already. Beckham's free kick is taken, and again, cold over the fist out of the penalty area. Lampard tries to head it back in again. Walcott goes steaming in, header on from Crouch. Lescott has stayed forward following that free kick. Andorra completely failing to clear, and now it's Beckham once more. Beckham onto Crouch, gets away from the defender well. He goes down under the challenge, looks for the free kick, and the Dutch referee was play on. Well, at the moment, looking at Andorra there where they were trying to clear the ball, Mike, they had six strong across the back. So it shows you where a total farce this game is. Well, and every time they clear, they just hit it straight back to a white shirt, and then now David Beckham tries to release Ashley Cole, but the ball just jumps away from him. Cole acknowledges Beckham's attempt, and it's a throw into Andorra near side. Pitch is good. Yes, it is, isn't it? I had David Plates head out before as well. It certainly wasn't good the last time they played here, but it's been relayed since the Ukraine match. But yeah, Fabio Capallo had a lot of concerns about the pitch, but the surface looks okay so far here this evening. Crouch now, and Lampard. Rooney's got the goal. Lampard again, couple of Andorra defenders with him. Lampard brushed the first one aside, but not the second, and in comes Alderfantz Lima with the challenge. And well, the whole of the game so far, really, the opening eight minutes has been played inside the Andorra in half. Steven Gerard now, back into midfield where Beckham is unmarked. Beckham immediately gives it to Walcott down the right, an invitation to take on the defenders. Two of the defenders there. Walcott goes down. No free kick is given. Andorra under great pressure once more. Eventually get it out, off an England player for throwing over on the far side of the field. England one, Andorra nil. Remember then earlier today, the Ukraine beat Kazakhstan by only two goals to one. Ukraine and Croatia now 11 points each from six, but England have a chance to go 10 points clear tonight at the top of the group. It's a free kick to England this time. Walcott's been fouled, and Andorra and player gone down as well. I've no idea where I think there was no challenge on in the tour. I don't think that he's... I think he tried to challenge Walcott. He's probably hurt himself. Referee is just checking on him to make sure that he's not feigning injury. He's certainly not going to allow the trainer on, I don't think. And it's going to be an England free kick. And this is one of the reasons why David Beckham's been reinstated to try and tease the Andorran defenders with his delivery from set pieces. Beckham's free kick. Again, Terry and Lescott have gone forward. Crouch is the tallest player in the penalty area. Beckham now prepares. In goes the free kick. Oh, Crouch didn't really get on the end of that one at all. He seemed off balance. He's such a tall man. He should have just directed that at goal. Instead, he's headed it wide. I don't think he really attacked it, Mike. I think he's coming all the way. He just didn't really attack it. He let the ball hit his head rather than coming attacking a downward header. And it's two-nil. Koldo in the Andorran goal, then preparing to clear for a side who look completely intimidated here at Wembley, the England fans. It's about half full here this evening, making good noise, though. The team are responding. Wolcott for England. It's about 98% possession so far from England. Lampard inside the centre circle. Lampard now looking to release Gerard down the left. Gerard hugs the touch line and then cuts in from this near touch line. Gerard shoots and the goalkeeper seem to see it late and turns it around for corner kick. Yeah, it seemed for a split second, Mike. He'd gone down very, very late in the goalkeeper. At least he made the save. Beckham takes the corners, right hand left, and Crouch waits and hopes that this time, if it comes his way, he can make a better effort with a header. Corner kick to England. Rooney inside the six-yard area. In goes the kick. Again, it's a fist from Caldo. This time he gets good distance. It's almost back on the halfway line. Ashley Cole retrieves. Wolcott immediately back in possession again. England one-and-or and nil. Ball in from Wolcott towards Crouch. Crouch reaches for it and feeds David Beckham 30 yards away. Beckham's ball. Well, you could see what he was trying to do because Wolcott was steaming in from the right hand side. He just had too much pace on it, though, and it's a goal kick. Yeah, just unfortunate because Jim Eneth, who was marking Wolcott, just let him run and a little bit more accuracy with the pass in Wolcott was in. We've got the England World Cup squad members here who received, belatedly, their medals today for being part of the 66 squad. I think they're going to be on the pitch at halftime. And incidentally, it was exactly 47 years ago that England went out of the 62 World Cup in Chile against Brazil. Some of the men who were here tonight played in that game, and that was England's last World Cup game before they came to Wembley to play Uruguay at the start of the 66 tournament. So we'll have the likes of Ron Springett and Jimmy Armfield and Ron Flauze and Jimmy Greaves, who all played in Chile in 62. They'll all be coming out at halftime, and I'm sure they're going to get a fantastic welcome. England are leading 1-0. Lampard of England switches the play now and finds Ashley Cole down this near side. He won't have to do too much defending tonight. Ashley Cole's Rooney waits patiently, Cole taking on the defenders, making his way towards the dead ball line. Still Ashley Cole knocks it back to Gerrard on the edge of the area. Square from him to Lampard, England having just so much of the ball. Now John Terry who's inside the andorra half, and why not? Ashley Cole again back in field to Gerrard. There's so much possession here. It's almost embarrassing for England as a high ball comes into crouch and now Silver used his arm even when Andorra get the ball down field to their striker. He can't control it. England take a kick quickly and it's Ashley Cole again on the edge of the andorra penalty area. Lampard ball into Gerrard. Gerrard now with too many defenders around him on that occasion. Andorra look to clear. How much ambition will there be in that? Not much because Lescott comes in very, very quickly. The pass was an obvious one and it's straight back again with the team in white and Glenn Johnson over on that right hand side. Walcott's made a run. Johnson Holes plays a shorter pass instead to Lampard on the edge of the centre circle. England 1-0. Andorra 0. In Scotland's group it's Holland 1-0. Holland have already qualified, Rooney now into Lampard. Lampard to Gerrard. Lampard tried to go for the return. He's gone down. There's no free kick though. Referee Ways play on. I'd like to see that again. I thought maybe Manning got blocked off. Frank Lampard. That's something that the Andorrans are very good at doing. Wayne Rooney, yes he did. Sorry mate he did get blocked off. Referee never saw it. Just one little note for you. Wayne Rooney's now got nine goals in this international season and the record is 10 from Gary Lineker in 1991 and he's also now got seven World Cup goals in this group and the record is eight. Tommy Taylor in 1958. So if Rooney gets another goal here tonight, well he'll be able to equal the Lineker. He'll go on to beat Tommy Taylor anyway, what I would have thought, with three more games to go after this one in the group. England 1-0. Andorra 0. Gerrard now down the England near side the field and they're just backing off him at the moment. This is dangerous for Andorra. Gerrard to the captain Terry and now Becken. Becken enjoying the free roll he has in the centre. Walcott up against two defenders. Walcott has support from Johnson. Johnson level with the edge of the Andorra in area. In it goes from Gerrard to Rooney. Back again almost and now Gerrard slips as he tries to tee that one up. He slips and so Andorra's goalkeeper, Coldo, can pick up the loose ball. That is really good play until Gerrard. I think, well how happened, he tried to clip the crossing and just play right foot against the left. It was good play from England. England in Kazakhstan on an awful pitch, wanted just too many touches at times but then zipping the ball around well here on a better surface. Wembley, Fabio Capello is in the technical area at the moment but he can't be too displeased with what he's seeing. Andorra barely crossed the halfway line. They have the ball now with number 11 Andorra himself and now it's back into the back five with Sonagy. Over on the left hand side, Jamea the left back. That's an awful pass though straight to Becken on the halfway line. I've got a question for you. How can you wear orange boots if you're the right back for Andorra? Well, the thing they normally say there is you have to be a good player, don't you, to get away with boots like that. I'm not sure how good he is as Rooney floats the cross. And Alan's just asking me a question about Tommy Taylor. How many games did they play in fifths? Certainly not as many as England are playing these days. Probably let me just think 1958, no more than maybe half a dozen. But you were there there weren't you? Yeah, that's right. I do remember watching that tournament on telly. I have to tell you. Yeah. And Tommy Taylor, of course, tragically killed in the Munich air disaster in 1958. England now on the ball over on the far side of the field. They lead here by one goal to nil. Here they come again. Lampard to Ashley Cole. Ashley Cole down the line to Rooney. Rooney checks and then flicks the ball onto Lampard. Lampard's cushioned header, but the goal keepers there again. I do remember that Brazil England game that I mentioned 47 years ago today listening to commentary on the game in the car on a journey with the folks back in 62. So Tom Finney in that team wasn't he? In 62? No, no, no, no. And on the 60 one nil the USA defeat. Johnny Haynes and Jerry Hitchens got the goal and Jimmy Greaves. England have the possession again just for once they're back inside their own half. David Beckham, nobody anywhere near him from Andorra. Retreating once more. Gerard to Lampard. Lampard spots Johnson over on the far side. Should have found him didn't. Only finds an Andorra. Now they approach the half way line, but immediately Johnson closes them down. Still have the ball with Jimenez. Jimenez now over to the left hand side where Silver is immediately swept aside by John Terry. Just as the content marketer. Well, the hopeless aren't the Andorra, but we knew that before we started. They've just got arguably 45 yards away from England's goal. How long we played? Let me tell you 16 minutes. I bet there's been some interest in interest in spread bets tonight. They haven't kept a clean sheet for over two years. 18 games now they've conceded in all of them. And it's a throw to England. England did have problems with Andorra in the in Capello's first game, qualifying game to the extent that he had to make a couple of changes at halftime. Joe Cole was brought on to score the goals in the end that mattered here. Rooney's got an early one after three and a half minutes on the ball is again near side down the England left. Ashley Cole hit system with a bit of pace doesn't reach crouch on this occasion and Merino now near side the Andorra and right gives it back to the man in those boots. The right back Ayala. They've got some famous names. All right, but Ayala and Vieira and Silver. But they're not the ones that we have come to know over the years. The famous ones. Silver is high. Ho is knee. Throw into Andorra. One nil down could easily have been two or three already. It's Fabio Capello still down there making sure that they keep the concentration up. John Terry of England. Terry now lovely ball onto Walcott waits for it to come onto him. Little bit of pace acceleration. They got it behind Johnson. Johnson checks back again to Walcott. Well, Johnson would have got the return but he was brought down by the defender over on the far side and the Dutch referee says calm down and England have a free kick. It's just absolutely no attempt whatsoever to play the ball and just block Johnson off. Should be yellow carbations. The only way they'll stop the Andorra's from filing all night. Another Beckham free kick from a long way out over on the right. This time he's knocked it short to Johnson who is unmarked. Johnson hasn't got it forward though. Andorra with a very high clearance. Crowd making as much noise as they can here. Maybe 45, 50,000 something like that. Quite a lot of vacant seats in the top tier over on the far side as England sweeper high boards towards Gerard. He controls it on his neck. Then he can't get in off that defender Ayala and England have a throw. But it's just nonstop pressure here on the Andorran defenders from England leading one nil and already on their way to a 10 point lead at the top of this group before the summer recess. Now Lantard. Lantard again to Ashley Cole has been given a lot of room down the left hand side. In comes a cross. It should be headed away by the defender, but it'll drop to, well, it should have, I thought it was going to drop to Johnson. It's Beckham instead. And in the end, it's Il Defon's limo with a header. But every time they clear, it comes straight back to the team playing at home. Terry in acres of space. Now Gerard's gone into the centre. Half thought about the shot, I think. Then does get the shot in and I think he's got a corner out of it. It's got a deflection and the corner's been given down the right far side. Yeah, it's actually a good block by the defender because Gerard just dropped the shoulder, didn't he? He just deflected just over the top of the crossbar. I just think with England, it's going through a little stage, Matt, where they need to work the ball a little bit quicker. Beckham prepares himself over on the right. England sends the second. In comes the corner. It doesn't reach Rooney. Again, Lima heads it away. Wolcott now has it back again and tries a big effort from almost 30 yards, Rooney, but the goalkeeper wasn't testing. I don't think the goalkeeper even moved. I think he knew straight away it was going in line. Have you played in many games like this, where you have the ball for virtually 99% of the time? All the games are played for Liverpool. Yeah, I thought you said that. We just keep setting him up for him really, don't we? You realise as soon as you've left your mouth on it, striking the true mid-wicket. Gold kick for Caldo and Crouch heads it straight back again. Rooney doesn't chase this one out, it's a lost cause. See, Tony Loom is just there trying in vain, I think, to bring them forward. They're just all in the retreat here as Caldo now clears into the England half. It's about the only way I think that Andorra are going to get the ball into the England half through goal kicks from Caldo. Ball bobbles around over on the far side. Johnson does enough to make sure he's got the throw in and England have a throw short of the half wayline. We've played just over 20 minutes of the first half. He's just joining us here from Wembley. England got an early goal through Rooney, header straight forward from Glenn Johnson's cross. And now the throw in taken. Crouch is playing tonight in place of Heskey. Lescott is in for Upson and David Beckham starts because of Barry's suspension. Rooney now, a little bit deep for him this time. Rooney's floater to the far side. Crouch is there, reaches for it and Crouch just wouldn't come down from him in the end against the defender and Andorra have a throw in. Fabio Catello doesn't look very happy actually Mark. He's just shaking his head a bit. When England started, they started bradly and what they did might, the switch the ball right to left, left to right, very, very quickly with a packed defense. It makes all the difference. It's just a little bit obvious at the moment and England have started to sling one or two crosses in and quite honestly, the two Lima brothers are decent in the air. And keep playing like this England, they're going to have a headache because they're dealing with everything that's coming in. Well, it is monotonous. I suppose sometimes you can have too much of the ball. Fabio Catello has very high standards. He's a perfectionist and now he's using Stuart Pierce, the under 21 coach to come out and also get an instruction across. He was talking to Rooney and what he's saying to Rooney is just stay and play up front for once in your life in this game. Certainly you don't have to go rampaging everywhere and help everybody else. Stay up front and cause a problem. Well, that was what Capello was saying yesterday in terms of advice he's given to Wayne Rooney for scoring goals. Just get into the penalty area, Wayne. Well, he did that early on here and scored. England lead one. Now they're just going off the ball a little bit, but now they'll be right back on the ball because commentary is with Alan Green. I'm just enjoying being totally relaxed about the outcome of the game. England will win this game. Whatever the score line, here's Ashley Cole forward. I don't want any clever Dick saying, well, they won't win it if it's 1-1 or if on Dora win 2. You'll only meet. Doesn't matter how many goals England scored tonight, they're going to win the game. And I look at Kazakhstan at the weekend mark and if games only lasted 45 minutes, Kazakhstan would be a decent team, but Andorra have nothing. Gerard, poor cross in from the left hand side, straight into the arms of Caldo and England have actually been guilty of squandering much of the possession they've had. Beckham's given the ball away a number of times and certainly not crossed properly. I was in corners up three kicks. Oh, that was a cheer for it. The silver get to the ball. Silver. No, no, no. Green. Green's first touch. Green's first touch. 23 minutes played. England on the attack again. Didn't last for long. That incredible pressure on Robert Green. Here's a cross played in by Johnson. Walcott is there and Walcott actually was a sort of half blocked by Rooney in terms of trying to get the ball across goal and it's behind for a goal kick. You notice as well that the crosses have started to get longer and deeper. Yes, it really, it really well just played to Andorra's hands. That's exactly what they want. A little bit more invention, a little bit more width needed. A goal kick to Caldo who was booked in Belarus. Here's the goal kick taken. Hit right footed up to the halfway line, headed back by Beckham and away by Sonagy out of the, out of playing the far side of the field for a throw in swing. Actually, the cry tonight, I'm told is actually better than, than we think it is because there are many more in the upper tier on this side of the ground that we can't see. So the attendance we think is near 50,000 than, than 45,000, which is a remarkable effort given the tube strike. Ashley Cole, Tolesko and I taken up by Lampard. Nevitably the plays in the endoring good ball to the far side. Well controlled by Glenn Johnson. Moving to the edge of the penalty, slip the ball in, runny turn, runny turns, slices his shot and is behind for a goal kick. Better play though Alan, wasn't it? Quicker ball out to the right, Johnson came inside on his left foot, played runy in. Much better from England, a little bit more creative. When I look at Andorra, I just see a team that hasn't got any ability, you can excuse that, but they kick, don't they? They kick. No they do. And I mean, the other thing as well, looking at it rather simplistically, if you're Fernando Silva, what, what an error do you get from this match? Nothing. A lone striker. Does he ever get a pass? Awful. Here's Lesko, on to Becker, on the halfway line in the centre circle, now to the left of it, forward to Gero, hugging the left touch line. Gero on his right foot, plays a good ball back to Terry, the captain, and on to the far side and Johnson, wall cuts in field, pass to Walcott, back to Johnson, and now Terry again, overwhelming possession for England, the score line's still only 1-0 and we've played nearly 26 minutes. Now Lesko drives the ball forward to Gerard, back to Lampard, Gerard again, on intended, the pass was towards runy, but it's tucked away by Ayala, and another cheer for Robert Green, who comes out of his penalty area, if he doesn't come out of his penalty area, might never see the ball. Beckham, clips it to the left side, good control by Ashley Cole, can't feed it into runy, and it's head out of play by Dunny Lima, oh I thought it had gone out of play with Beckham, kept it in play. Beckham, then plays it forward, not a good pass from Beckham, and it squirts through to the goalkeeper, Caldo. Where's my goal? Oh he's been to get a cup of coffee. Did he only bring one? Not a team player obviously. No he's not a team player. A team player would have brought copies for everybody. Anyway he's too busy doing his notes in the second half. Here's John Terry, to Beckham, Silver's down, he gets the sympathy vote, and the referee will come and see, oh has he got a crack in the head? He says he has. Well he may have done you know, a lampard challenge, well he does appear to have had a crack in the head, so I take it all back, he is an injured party, Silver. Well, Graham Taylor, what are your thoughts Graham? Reminds me of a testimonial game, this does you know, the opposition aren't going to get a touch of the ball, you come to watch one side, and you let them play, and then it's a question of will they deliver. From a point of view I agree with Mark, they've no need to knock the ball into Peter Krauss to tell you the truth, they can play it sharp, they can play it quick, they can play around them, they can play through them, and they just lose that little bit when they start to play it in from those wide angles in the air to them, they've no need to do that. Now Silver's definitely got a crack in the head because his head was wrapped in a towel as he headed the dressing, presumably he needs stitches, he might even be replaced. So they're down to 10-man at the moment, Andorra, which doesn't really change things because they're defending anyway. Well that's going to change the formation isn't it? Yeah it's now by 4. No, now it's 1-9-0. Oh we mustn't laugh, there is blood on Silver's head, and he rather threw a bottle down in some disgust. England 1 and Doran Hill, you know, they've seen the 5 live in the BBC, we played 28 minutes, so the first half here at Wembley, the odd kickoff presumably was to accommodate Coronation Street. Great idea. Here's Ashley Cole, back to Lampard, and Lampard on to Beckham, Johnson's available down the right flank, and a simple pass by Beckham finds the full back, almost miscontrolled it, but keeps it in play, in it goes to Walcott, Walcott in the penalty, pulls it back, Lampard must score, and side-footed the ball, low into the net, squeezed it through, goalkeeper and defender, England 2 and Doran Hill, Lampard 17th goal for his country. How simple was that, was it? Great into play, width on the right-hand side, great play by Johnson, ball through, play to Walcott, speed of movement, speed of thought, pull back for Lampard, crouched it to a rich, simple as anything 2-0. Well done, and a more accurate reflection of the way the first 29 minutes have gone, England overwhelmingly in control here, and actually they're warming up two substitutions, Andorra, they may as well put both of them on, won't make a blind bit of difference. Yeah, but to be fair they're missing silver. Yeah, well we're all missing silver, especially his tantrum. Anyway, they kick off, there's still down to 10 men, the team all in red, Andorra, and he's back to Elefond's Lima, who hits it up field towards Jiménez on the far side of the field, and the referee from Holland is decided that was a foul challenge by Glenn Johnson, so here's an opportunity actually for Andorra, they've got a free kick, 35 yards of goal. There's nothing wrong with that challenge, Johnson just headed the ball, and the fella threw himself onto the floor, look at him, he's up, there's nothing wrong with him. Right, getting shot of silver on his backside in the tunnel, no wiping his face for blood, a lot of blood, see me for silver. Yeah, there's a genuine team player, Tracy's been out and she's got coffee for everybody. Yeah, but I ordered tea. So free kick, and look, they've committed three plus up to the edge of the England penalty area, the three central defenders, and it's a terrible free kick, which is headed away comfortably by Gerard to the half way line. Ayala plays it forward again up to the penalty area, and above the head of Elefond's Lima behind for a goal kick. Il de Fons Lima was the only Andorra player in the England penalty area at the time, he comes silver. He comes silver, we've missed him greatly, and he's back on the pitch and they're up to a full complement of 11 players. Beckham for England, who lead 2-0 against Andorra, goals from Rooney and Lampard, early goal from Rooney, in the fourth minute Lampard got the second in the 29th, Johnson, into Walcott, and Walcott, a poor pass from Walcott, played left, but well ahead of Gerard, and it rushes behind for a goal kick. I tell you what you can see from England, down there right in the future, certainly Johnson and Walcott on the day, lots and lots of pace, there's no doubt about that. Very comfortable on the ball, Johnson, he's in love the way as well as a fullback, he comes inside and therefore has an option in terms of his passes, he really has improved since he left Chelsea. Yeah, but you're still happy with him defensively, Mark? Yeah, I think so, that's a great problem, and if you look around World Football, there aren't too many left-sided players that are going to cause you too many problems. Okay, here's Walcott holding off two challenges rushing forward, towards the penalty area, defender gets in a tackle and it's behind for an England corner. 13 minutes to go to halftime, David Beckham, and no great hurray, goes across to the corner, acknowledges the applause from the England fans on the far side of the field, who unquestionably love the former captain, his 112th captainite for this country, and he will close in on Peter Shilton's record, takes the corner short to Johnson, Johnson now into Walcott and Walcott, I think he was attempting a shot, but he got it all wrong and he just chipped it behind for a goal kick. I think he hit it right for onto left and it just spooned over, didn't it? What do you think the Andorra manager says to his players at halftime? Great start lads, it's only 2-0, keep it going, remember our record deficit is 8-1 or 7-0, do anything better than that, be great. So keep it down? Keep it down. Well what else is there? There's nothing else? Well no, not something else. I'm not getting it, there's just nothing for them to do. I just don't see the point of a team like this competing in a regular qualifying group, there should be pre-qualifying in European Championship and World Cups. On the half-way line it's with Andorra, for Andorra and he's done well inside the centre circle, plays it on to Moreno, Moreno shoots from long range and just for a second there, Robert Green thought I'd better not let this one in and he got across his goal line and was happy to see it go over the crossbar. He just had to scamper a little bit. Just a little bit. Well you can't have that against your record on your CV, letting Goal score by Andorra from 25 yards, Lampard, good ball to the far side to Johnson, the England fullback, he's really playing right midfield. Hardly any need for any England defence tonight. Beckham in the centre of midfield, gets the ball to Lampard, back it goes to Beckham who's inside the centre circle, on to the man who's succeeded him as captain, John Terry, to Rooney, Terry, Rooney again, England patient, the bill up and that's better than hitting it long. Here's Ashley Cole on the left side, back to Wayne Rooney and Rooney, clips the ball towards the far side, no Andorra prayer with a 30 yards of Glenn Johnson, Johnson controls it, moves forward, edge of their penalty area, looking to lay it off for a shot, too many red shirts between him and Goal, takes it the other way, goes wide, well done Glenn Johnson, can't get the ball back properly, might get another chance and he's won a corner. He's been England's best player, you know, the most creative certainly. And Walcott's been quite clever actually, when Johnson's had the ball he stepped inside and given him some room to take on his marker. Jero takes the corner, not Beckham, played in, Terry was there, heads it down, he was being led down and the ball is finally clear, at least it goes to Walcott, on to Jero, another cross from the right, in towards the near post, headed up in the air, crouches there and sort of moved his body in the general direction, it came off a defender and is behind for a corner and this one, Beckham will take. I think that might have actually been Silver defending in his own penalty area, shot. Probably off the gash in his head, Beckham with a corner, how many minutes to halftime, a little over 10, right footed from the left, in towards the far post and that should have been a header in at goal by Lescott, poor header. It was, I think he just took his eye off it at the last moment, certainly any contact, it's 3-0, decent delivery as you would expect. Yeah, he should have done better. Yeah. Grant Taylor, how are you doing down there? What are you? It's a bad island, 25 yards away. How do you give him your coffee? About that. Right, what about the second goal? I thought it was an example of what Mark was saying, it was sharp, it was quick, Walcott pulled it back on the floor and I think that, you know England have to keep doing that, move the ball quickly, keep it on the floor, move yourselves and you'll just open them at will. Here's England leading 2-0, 10 minutes to go halftime here at Wembley Stadium and it's been, you know, reasonably entertaining. I think if it was, you know, sort of nil, they would all be saying, well, when are you going to score? But it just feels comfortable. It's going to be seven wins out of seven, by the way, Holland are beating Norway 1-0, they too will have 21 points in their first seven games. On the far side, Johnson pulls the ball in left footed, cleared by Sonage and then Terry misunderstands what Johnson's intention was and plays the ball ahead of the full back out for a throw into Andorra. Holland have already qualified, haven't they? Yes, they have, by winning against Iceland at the weekend. I think Spain have also got maximum points in a European group as well. But, you know, that's quite an accomplishment, isn't it? You know, in England they've played, you know, Ukraine and Croatia, good side, Ukraine won earlier, by the way, they beat Kazakhstan 2-1 and Macedonia beat Iceland 2-0 in a Lutson-Scotland group, as is the Dutch game. Throw into Andorra on the halfway line, the game sort of quietened down nice as the crowd. It's just a recognition that Andorra are painfully limited. Chamber, they left full back, just over the halfway line, hesitates to throw, finally throws towards Silver, it's headed away by Johnson, Chamber heads it forward again straight out of play. Well, what a waste of time that was. He could have just thrown the ball initially doing and kept the game moving. Johnson throw into back up and on Nijtijera, left of the centre, Seracol. Lampard close by, but it's played to the left side and Ashley Cole. Cole back to Lampard, Jared in a forward position. Lampard plays it to the right, to Johnson. Walcott's further down that touch line, gets to the ball now, is tackled by Chamber and it breaks out for an England throw in, midway inside the Andorra half. England two, Andorra 0, you've just seen the five live on the BBC and later tonight, by the way, when the game finishes, and in about an hour and 10 minutes time, I'll be presenting 6-0, 6 the lines will be opening in 10 minutes. The number you wish to call is 0-500-909-693. Johnson with a throw into Walcott, what remark are you going to make? Now what would you call up and say though? Weren't Andorra great? Weren't England brilliant and Beckham should be in the starting team, starting line up every game. They're just trying to provoke me. Gerard back to Lescott, to Gerard again, inside left channel for England and moving in field. Gerard wants some movement further forward, there wasn't a great deal so he plays it to Johnson, good control by Johnson, level edge of the penalty, back to Beckham, early cross in by Beckham, Crutch jump, missed time to jump, and it's cleared by Andorra, and they want to start a fight here. I mean Crutch went to beat the ball, collided with the defender, I think Tony Lima. No, Lima's the one, the six, yeah, sorry. Yeah, it was complaining. Yeah, Ildefan's Lima went in for a Barney, waste of time. Lampard for England, referee saw nothing wrong, and there was nothing wrong. Low cross in, Rudy scored the third goal, brilliant the other half, Bolly, and Rudy now has equal Gary Linnicka's record, really is equal Gary Linnicka's record in terms of the number of international gold scored in the season. What are you saying Mark? Yet another cross from Glenn Johnson, and a great cross that it was certainly. Just picked him out, one touch, control, low, flicked it in, definitely not offside, great finish. Good, good, good finish from Wayne Rudy. Can Phil as Boots here tonight? Yeah. How many goals does he want? Actually, he's been quite quiet between the two goals, you know. Must be so bad that, mustn't he? No, well done, Wayne Rudy. Well, it's that 24 for England tonight. You remember all that time we went with Gary thinking, we knew, is he going to get to Bobby Charlton's record? He never quite made it. Wayne Rudy's definitely going to become England's leading goal scorer of all time. Barring a series injury, and please don't let that happen. Three shots and target two goals. Not bad. England three and Doronil, six minutes to go to half time. No, five shots, three on target, two goals. I thought I said three shots on target, anyway. Whatever I said. And England could actually, you know, Graham mentioned it earlier, what he said could easily be double-figure here tonight. The record defeats were 8-1 by the Czech Republic, and 7-0 by Croatia, both in 2005. Norris has said to me he's equal Tommy Taylor's record as well. As he mentioned, everybody gave Tommy Taylor played in group matches. I think, you know, Wayne Rudy's had a few more opportunities. England three-kick, taking 20. No, no, no, no, no, it's not. He's taking it back. He's getting one of their players being booked. 11. Andorra. Andorra has been booked for blocking Geron off. Right, okay. Well, it'll be the first of a few, you think. Three-kick to England, eights Beckham territory. It's around about 25 yards from goal to the left, as England are playing. And so, Mr. Caldo, watch out. Beckham has placed the ball, lampars nearby, but surely it will be David Beckham's right foot that delivers. It's a sort of sideways run up by the former England captain. A Mexican wave around Wembley. England three-hand, Doher now. Beckham three-kick to come. There it goes. Right footed in towards the near post, and the goalkeeper got down well and gathered it very easily. And Mike, who's been sitting up all night, I know he has to get ready for this game. He's now in level with Jeff Terst, Wayne Rudy, 24 goals. It's not Mike, it's Norris as in McWhorter. Here's Peter Crouch, who despite his tiring build, is actually not that great in the air, and he loses out there. And Andorra hit it upfield, and is that Robert Green's third touch of the ball? Boy, he's getting spoiled here. Whose record does that equal, though? Does Mike know that? Ashley Caldo on the left side was the target for lampars pass, but it was intercepted by Ayala, and it's out of play for a throw in to England. Left side, Ashley Caldo takes it. Back to Gerard. And now in to Beckham. Beckham on the edge of the centre circle. Onto Glen Johnson. Who you're right, certainly he's a hat, no defending to do, but an attacking sense has played really well tonight. His crossfield ball to Lescon, on to Ashley Cole again, into Gerard, to Rune. To Gerard. Gerard, not quite enough room for the shot, evaded a foul challenge by Sonagy, and then he gave the ball away, and it should be cleared by Andorra. Well, at least it's run away from the penalty here by Jimenez, and then it's left for Beckham to take up England possession again. Alan Silvio, the lone striker, is 25 yards in his own half. Ridiculous. At least he's made a challenge, a winning challenge on Gerard. Then Gerard wins the ball back, and here's Andorra holding off Rune, and that's with Ayala, who's brave enough to wear those orange boots, and he just belts it up over the half way like straight through to Robert Green, fourth touch for the West Ham goalkeeper. And the Mexican Wave continues, unfortunately, to indicate that the crowd are just getting a little bit bored. England three, and Andorra nil. That's frankly, it's good a position the first half as I would have anticipated. Quite pleased with the way England are playing. Lampard, excellent ball to Ashley Cole. Left edge of the penalty here. Cole's cross too deep, surely, but it comes back off an offender. The defender was Jimenez, and it's behind for a corner to England. I just thought a little bit earlier speed of thought and movement from Walcott. He might have gotten on the end of that. He was waiting for it rather than attacking it. Beckham, to take the corner from the right hand side. Lescott made the run to the near post. Beckham decided to replace the ball inside the quadrant. Beckham, no. Deliberately plays it outside of the penalty, and she had a walk on. Onto Lampard, the pass from Walcott, not really firm enough. Half intercepted. Oh, there's some pushing going on, but we're yielded points, Lima and Crouch. Look, they're always wanting to start a fight. The game hasn't stopped. England's still on the attack. Lescott in towards Crouch, intercepted by Lima, and neither shouting at Lescott. The defenders, because there was an Andorran player down. I'm not sure that he's injured. Alisson, the other thing is anyway, it's a referee to stop the game. Tell that, oh good, Cole has been put for the second match in succession for protesting the captain. The attendance, by the way, is much better than we thought. 57,897. Do you believe that? I don't know. Would I ever say that the people who count the crowd at Wembley got it wrong deliberately? I'd say, well, ask Norris to count them in the second half, but I don't think it's 57,000 in here. All right, calm down, Andorra, calm down. One minute left in the first half. England 3, Andorran L. Beckham with a corner from the left side, right footed, deep towards the far post, and Crouch in the face. There was an appeal, I think, by John Terry. It was a hand that hit Crouch in the face, and Andorra run the ball into the England half, and I had to play for a throw-in. I think it's a ball, Alan. The ball hit him in the face. I think it did. Just watching if there was a hand as well. Ball first, then, and it just came across. And Alisson's Lima tried to make sure he hit him, and he stood on him as well, just for goodness sake. Well, just, you know, why not? Here's Beckham to Lampard. I think you and Graham were wondering before the game, you know, the danger of injury with the approach, this obviously abrasive approach of Andorra, and it's still there. Yeah, it's because they don't know how to kick you properly. Beckham, glorious crossfield ball. Excellent control by Johnson. Johnson in, on his left foot, tries to shoot for Glory, and Belton high in the crowd after he was tackled as well. Wasn't great, as I said before, what he does do, Johnson, it comes inside all the time, and he does open out the angles for himself, obviously. It's occasionally not particularly well-structured. Great ball that he's shown on the TV here again. I just missed the fourth official, by the way, I think it's a minute. Can only be a minute of added time, surely. And we're into added time at the end of the first half. It's really satisfactory. England three, Andorra nil, two goals from Rune, one from Lampard. Rune with the first and the third. Good header by Terry, but then the ball is now with Marina on the halfway line, and they're inside the England half, and now they play it back to Ayala, the full back. He almost gave it away, collected by Andorra though, and now Marina again to Ayala, where are they going? Nowhere. Ashley Cole collects possession for Ringe, and finds John Terry, and on it goes to Glenn Johnson on the far side of the field, right of the centre circle, onto Walcott. There's the halftime whistle from the referee, and John's already done, I think they're playing quite well. Yeah, they are playing well in England, just a little spell after the first goal in between the first and the second, where they started to go a little bit sort of long ball, but generally after that, the composition, the way they've made the goals and taken them is very, very good indeed. You do have to say, and we're harking on about it, Andorra are hopeless. The lines are open now for 606, 05, 109, 9, 6, 9, 3. I'll be on the air between the conclusion of this programme and 11 o'clock, so do keep me company tonight. Last opportunity of the season for you to get your calls in. England have got their calls in in the first half, England 3 and Andorra Nill. Graham Taylor, what do you say about that? It's very much the same, isn't it? They're doing the job, they're doing what the manager's asked of them. He was caught as saying, an early goal will make the game easy. That's exactly what they've done. Lovely goal, the third one. What a sweet finish that was from a man really in form, really. You have to say this as well, irrespective of the opposition. If you look, he does a great little turn off his defender, and his finish is immaculate. It doesn't matter about the opposition, that's a very, very good goal. I think if I were coming here today as a spectator, I would be as excited about what's going to happen at halftime as I was about the match. And that is those from 1966 who didn't play in the final have got their medals today from Downing Street, and they'll be on the pitch at halftime. I hope they turn the sprinklers off for Jimmy Armfield and the rest. I don't want his best suit ruined. Well, Jimmy Armfield and Peter Bonetti and those who didn't play in the final in 1966 are being applauded onto the pitch here at Wembley. We'll hear from them in a moment after Kevin House can tell us about India beating Ireland in the world 2020 at Trent Bridge tonight. That's right, both teams are ready through, of course. The target was just 113. India's victory by eight wickets, 15 balls remaining. Rohit Sharman not out half-century. The night proving what many would expect a tough one for Ireland. Now, Keemann, Nylo Bryan and Trent Johnson were both expected to be fit to face New Zealand tomorrow in the Super 8. It was a struggle, but not one which will dangerously destroy confidence, I don't think. India's Zaheer Khan blowing away their batting with four wickets. Gary Wilson and John Mooney keeping the dignity after crashing to 28 for four in seven overs. The former county player Andrew White was Khan's final wicket, compiling 29, including three fours and one six, reduced to 18 overs beside due to some rain in Iran. They totaled 112 for eight. India, even without Seawag, appear very capable of defending their title. They face England, the West Indies and South Africa in the next stage. Also looking good, Arshra Lanka, who beat earlier today the West Indies by 15 runs. One other piece of news regarding New Zealand this evening. It sounds if their opener, Jesse Ryder, is feeling very unwell. He's remained in London instead of traveling to Nottingham under observation in hospital. Their team manager says that Jesse's injury is unclear, suffering from a significant infection and he certainly won't be able to play tomorrow against the Irish. Thank you very much indeed. It's fair to say Graham Taylor, the biggest cheer for those who didn't play in the final, is for the man. I really, this is the one man I wish I'd seen playing, Jimmy Greaves. Well, you know, people talk about how many goals you've scored for England and they put, in relation to the games you play and the goals that you scored, along with Nat Loftaus, he's the top man. I mean, look, anything in the box, Jimmy's going to put it in the net for you. It was a fantastic finisher, an excellent player. And of course, Jimmy Greaves, who played in the group games, didn't he? Then got an injury, he got a gash in his shin, then was fit for the final, but Sir Al Framsi decided not to change his forward line of Roger Hunt and Jeff Hurst. And Al Framsi was proved completely right, of course, but it must have been and it was very, very difficult for the most, arguably the most natural goal scorer England has ever had. And I don't care who you are, you know, it's got to hurt at that time. And of course, it should, you know what I mean? You can't suddenly turn around and say, well, I don't really mind, but it's so good to see them all. I mean, names, I've been a professional footballer for years at this stage in 66. So all of these names are at the prime, they're at the height, everything that you are looking for. And in many respects, wanting to be yourself. Let me just run through the names. So these are those who didn't play in the final and they have at last 43 years later got their medal. Of course, very soon after that, all those in the squad did get a medal. Jimmy Greaves, John Cannelly, Ron Springett, Peter Bonetti, Jimmy Armfield, Jerry Byrne, Ron Flowers, Norman Hunter in Callaghan, George Easton and Terry Payne. Some of those particularly players like Cannelly and Payne played in earlier games, didn't they? When Alprams, he started with wingers and in the end it evolved for one reason and another into Martin Peters and Allen Ball. But some did play early on and some like our own Jimmy didn't play at all in that tournament. No, they didn't. I mean, Jimmy was coming up, leading up to it. I don't know whether he lost his place through injury or what, but George Cohen took over and held his place. Yes, Jimmy was injured just before the World Cup. He broke his metatarsal before it had even been invented. They wouldn't know what that was in those days. I can see him down there with David Oates. So I'm just about to get the signal. I've got the signal. Here he is, Jimmy Armfield with David. Well, Jimmy, 43 years. It's been a long wait. Has it been worth the wait? Well, I must be honest, at the time, we never thought about getting medals, to be honest. We thought, well, we would just satisfy the team we'd won. We all wanted to play, of course. But the simple truth is that now it's come. It's really good, I think. I've enjoyed the day. I think all of us have enjoyed seeing each other again over the last three or four days. I think that's been really terrific. And now I've got the medal. Yes, I think it's a really super day. It's funny because it would be unthinkable now, really, for anybody in the squad not to get a medal. Life was a bit harsher like that in those days. If you didn't actually play and played in the earlier rounds, it made no difference. You still get it. And we accepted that was the way it was. I think it was as simple as that. Jimmy Graves is here as well. Jimmy, obviously, you were fit for the final, but missed out in a place. Does this go some way to making up for that? Not really. It's just a lovely day out. We've had a good time. I've seen London by coach. I've had a wonderful police escort, which took us all around London, got here. It's a great stadium. It's great to see the lads again. I wouldn't say that we haven't seen each other for a long time, because we do see each other. But they're all together. Georgie Coins here, representing Sir Alph as well. And it's been a really, really pleasant day. It's a shame about the game, but that's how it goes. Well, you can only beat what's put in front of you. As you say, George, representing Sir Alph. Obviously, a bit of a shame that Sir Alph isn't here to accept this himself. Wally has been nearly 100 years old. It's a privilege and I'm very proud to represent Lady Ramsey. And I feel she cannot be here because she's advanced in age. But she asked me to represent Alph. And I'm happy, very proud to have done so. This seems to be a terrific camaraderie between all the squad members. You do seem to get on. Oh, yes, sir. We have reunions every year. It's a wonderful affair. Even the wives get on, you know. So, but this is the good thing. We've stayed friends for many, many years. Because when we've met each other, we go home north, east, south and west. But it's always been a very, very good, close knit unit. And that's how Sir Alph would have liked it. Thanks, George. And Jimmy, I feel just that last word for you. I couldn't leave five live without showing you my medal. The listeners can't see it. You can describe what it says. Well, it's to go that far across about an inch and a half for the Jules Remaid trophy on one side. I'll let you read what it says on the other. Oh dear. Now you're asking. England 1966 World Championship, the Jules Remaid Cup. England. Brighter place. The Engfield trophy cabinet. Of course. Thank you very much. It's back in Jimmy's pocket. I can see it already before David Hoates gets too close to it. Jimmy Groves hasn't lost his sense of humour, has he? Well, he hasn't. But what he is, he's been honest with everybody and he shows his hurt. Because you must be, when you think about it, how he must have felt at that particular time. And yes, as the years go on, it probably gets less and less. But what I liked about Jimmy there, honestly, he wasn't going to, that's, yeah, it doesn't really make him for it because his view would be probably one of the most disappointing times of his life was not to get in that far. But life goes on and he's done fantastically well as Jimmy. I always think the irony about Jimmy Greaves and the World Cup final is that in 1970, so the next World Cup, there were substitutes. Because there were no substitutes in 1966. And I said this to Jimmy on field the other day, just think about this, had the final been in 1970, he'd have come off the bench, wouldn't he? Can you imagine 2-2, you'd have got Jimmy Greaves straight off the bench, wouldn't you? How unlucky the timing of it all. It's all about timing in everything, isn't it? Mark Lawrenson, wonderful to see these players rewarded so. Yeah, but I have to say Mark, I thought they should have got the medals here before this crowd, before the game. It's nothing to do with the Prime Minister and Downing Street. This is all about England footballers who, unfortunately, they were in the 22, they didn't quite obviously make it onto the pitch. They should have been here tonight getting the medals before the game in front of this Wembley crowd and in front of proper football supporters, and that would really have put the gloss on the situation. I agree, but I suppose the fact that it's half empty in a way that we've saved ourselves. I think it would have been 80, 90,000, absolutely heaving. I'm with you all the way and I'm sure a lot of people know that when it was all arranged. We weren't to know that it was going to be a tube strike, so there you go. It's a life we live in, I'm afraid. Which of those players would you pick out that you remember particularly as you were growing up, Mark? I can remember every single one. I mean, look at George Easton there. I mean, the players in the dressing room now below, just below us, how thankful would they be to George Easton because of the fantastic money that they're earning? But I mean, it was inevitable as well that Greavesy would get the best and the biggest salvation. I thought he was just an absolute sensational football. But Jimmy, of course, one of our friends here on Five Live, one of the very first, if not the first, attacking fullbacks. He was an outstanding player and Jimmy's given so much back to the game. But all those players, Norman Hunter, a nicer bloke you couldn't wish to meet, but he would have sold his granny for a quid on the pitch. And that's the way those players were. Nice to meet you, unless you had the ball, Mark. Absolutely. Man, you don't mention Paul then to him. 1973, of course. Jimmy says he was the first overlapping fullback. I asked him, I said, were you, he said, yes, I was the first overlapping fullback. I can believe that he was. I actually saw Jimmy play for Blackpool. He must have been right at the end of his career. I don't know, it was 70 or 71, when they lost at home to Arsenal, actually went on to do the double that day. And even then, he was still very much of that attacking right back mould. It's interesting now, television interviewing Jimmy Greaves, inevitably he is the focus of attention. 57 caps, 44 goals, Graham. That just brings to mind what you were saying in terms of the ratio, this wonderful word ratio. That's how I think, you know, if you turn right, yes, of course, you say you've scored the most goals, but in terms of games and goals scored, then you look. I mean, I think Loft House is something like about 28 in 31, do you know what I mean? But Jimmy is right up there at the very, very top. And of course, he won his England place back the year after, wasn't it? That was the end of his international career. He was back in the England team the year after. I think they all say the most important thing in the game is putting the ball in the net, and he could do that easily. Let me just tell you that the Lions thrashed the Sharks 39-3 in their latest tour match this evening in Durban, five tries for the Lions, and Andy Murray will face Spain's Guillermo Garcia Lopez in the third round of the Aegon Championships at Queens after thumping Andreas Seppi in straight sets. Well, England have found the back of the net three times in the first half, and Aura have barely been inside the England penalty area. Here's my kingdom. Thank you, Mark and Wayne Rooney having scored two in the first half, and equal that Gary Linica record of 10 in one season. Isn't going to get the opportunity to add to that in the second half. He's been replaced by Jermaine Defoe and another England change, Ashley Young has come on for Steven Gerrard. So the revised England lineup now is Green, Johnson, Terry Lescott and Ashley Cole, Walcott, Beckham, Lampard, Ashley Young, Defoe and Crouch. No changes made at all by Andorra at halftime. Their team is Caldo, Tony Lima, Ayala, Sonagy, Ildefont, Slimer and Schema, Merino, Andorra, Vieira, Jimenez and Silva. And you can understand really why Fabio Capallo is making these changes now because this game is won, and he's really trying to find a squad of 23 as well for the World Cup. It's not just about the 11, so it's a great chance for Defoe. We've got a couple of goals against Andorra in that five-nil-win at Old Trafford, and also a really good opportunity for Ashley Young who's had such a good season for Asta Villa to run at the full back over on the far side. The second half, and I really don't understand this, the second half is seconds old and Andorra going to make a change, and goodness knows why they didn't make it at halftime, but they're going to make a change in a moment, and while it just sort of defies logic really, as Beckham finds Theo Walcott near side the England right, England playing from left to right in the second half. Johnson who had such a good first half in an attacking form. The ball runs all the way through to Ashley Young over on the far side, cross shot comes in from him, and it's over. Now we're going to have a change more already, but I'm not quite sure why this happens. From England's point of view there, actually, it was a half chance for Ashley Young, came a long way and waited a long time to bring the ball down, just took it inside onto his right foot and failed to hit the target basically. Well, this is an interesting change too, because it looks like it's the end of Tony Lima's international career. That's what it is then, right? So he gets an ovation. Gets the, sure everyone here is aware of this, and he's exactly twice the age of the man who's coming on Val, Valets is coming on. The young 19-year-old is coming on to play, so that's the end of Tony Lima who doesn't even have a club actually. Now he's unattached, just plays international football, and he's certainly milking the moment coming off to be replaced now by Valets. Yeah, I think that's something, he just shook the hand of the manager as well, and that's exactly what that was all about. By the way, just finally on the 66 thing, it really has been an anomaly that the squad players and even players that played in the World Cup, when you think that 45 medals are cut nowadays, just think about someone like Ian Callaghan, for example, in that final group game against France, and more on that in a moment, as England build with Walcott and Defoe, Defoe on to David Beckham, 3-0 to England remember, Beckham keeps it in, plays it back to Johnson, Johnson across the field now, Les Scott's there inside the Andorra half, Andorra haven't crossed the half-way line yet in the second half, down the line from Ashley Cole to another Ashley, Ashley Young, Young on the ball for England, whips in the cross towards Crouch, headed away, and I'm not sure I'm going to get a moment to tell you my Ian Callaghan story, but we'll just watch the game continue once more, with Lampard, Lampard to Young eventually from Ashley Cole, England 3-0 and Andorra on 5-0. England struggling a bit in that final group game against France until Ian Callaghan put over a cross to the far post, which Roger Hunt managed to squeeze in, and you know, if England hadn't won that game, they wouldn't have played at Wembley in the quarter-final, and they'd have had to play Germany in the quarter-final, I think the game was at Hillsborough, so you know Ian Callaghan changing history really, and only today does he get his reward for that. England going forward to throw in the penalty area, round the challenge, angle awkward, and he's hit it wide. I'm not sure, actually, first things first, when the ball came to him, Mike, the defender slid in, if Defoe had gone down, he got a penalty, I think that's the first thing we should say. Secondly, then I think he changed his mind, I think he thought about trying to score, saw the angle was narrow, and ended up, I think almost sort of trying to cross as well, and basically it was neither, was it neither, one nor two there. Mike Lawrence, some with us here on 5-5, the crowd given is 57,000 on the night when there's a tube strike here, and England leading and threatening to score more here. I'm not sure what path of the course would be really, I suppose three in the first half and three in the second perhaps, 6-0 would suffice I think, but England are going to go 10 points clear of the group, Rooney with two first half goals, as Alan was mentioning, is now level with Jeff first at 24, and he's gone above tonight to great, great players, Stan Mortensen and Tommy Freak it to Andorra, short of the half way line, how on earth Fabio Capello can really gauge Robert Green tonight in the England goal, he's had to do absolutely nothing, and now Terry finds Ashley Cole over on the far side, back in field to Lampard who scored one of the England goals before the break, 3-0 they lead, Rooney two and Lampard, Lampard now, back again to Beckham, Beckham who hasn't scored for England since the World Cup in Germany, long ball to this near side, Glenn Johnson again, no problems going forward Glenn Johnson, it's just occasionally when he's examined by a really quality side when his defensive duties are examined, now Ashley Young over on the left, Ashley Cole again, 3-0 England, back again to Young, Young teasing the defender, moves inside, skims across in straight at the goalkeeper. It's funny what you say there about Glenn Johnson, didn't we used to say exactly the same thing about Ashley Cole? Yes, yes but Fabio Capello likes his defenders to defend, I think he's said that about Micah Richards who hasn't come through under Fabio Capello and what do you think about his defensive qualities? No I think it needs to be improved but I don't think it's that bad and also I think sometimes in international football your fullbacks have more of the ball than anybody else and it's very very important from England's point of view that they're on the ball all the time. Andorra camped inside their own penalty area, they're all back, even the striker is back now, Silver as well, Johnson, Johnson onto Wolcott, Wolcott, the Andorran defenders doubling up to try and contain Wolcott, Beckham now, clips the ball long range to the far side, the man that Mark was talking about, Ashley Cole is there, Cole onto Young again, Young slides the ball into Cole, Cole can't control it and it's a goal kick but England are threatening more goals. Yeah clever play Ashley and just a little bit too much loft on the pass, a flatter pass and Cole was in it, it's a good one too actually, both got great places to lad. They got the fixtures right didn't they Mark because they had to play Kazakhstan at some point and coming back from Kazakhstan of all the games you'd want this would be it, absolutely and I don't know who was in charge of the fixtures but they got its spot on. Goal kick to Andorra hanging on here, 3-0, clips by Caldo to the half-whiland, it's also his last international game this evening and it's left once more by Ildefonse Lima back again to Caldo. So England won 5-0 at Old Trafford against Andorra, 3-0 eventually in that awful game they played in Barcelona under Steve McLaren, then 2-0 at the start of this international season and at the moment it's 3-0 but it surely will be more than that come the final whistle. Was that that was a night of you have right what you want to write It was an awful night and Steve McLaren got dogs abuse as well from some of the fans out there Stephen Gerrard in the end bailed England out with a couple of goals and the third goal was scored by Nugent as well who hasn't been seen since in the England squad. Lampard of England on to Beckham again total possession of the ball down that left hand side it's a great opportunity for Ashley Young here he goes past the a very half-hearted challenge then in the end the defender gets back and denies Ashley Young he should have got his crossing really it's another goal kick. Stumbled you just you just to worry a little bit with Ashley Young trying too hard which is perfectly normal in this situation. So are we happy with the pitch now here is everything great yeah I mean why wasn't they sorted out in the first place you know 960 million pounds for the stadium and three and six for the pitch. Right from day one when they played another 21 game here the first match against Italy it was clear that there were problems but it's okay this evening the ball is traveling through and or again looking to goalkeeper Caldo to come diving out England could make one more change was he out of his penalty area. No no no there's a little nudge by Walcott on that on the on the six he now wants to fight him. He'll defonsely in there just oh makes you laugh isn't it. They've hard just hearing that Holland now lead Norway by two goals to nil in Scotland's group but remember Holland have already qualified it's all about second place there earlier Macedonia had a victory against Iceland as well Macedonia to Iceland nil so Macedonia now level with Scotland seven points each but Scotland do have a game in hand. Now we've got a free kick to Andorra but the refs just had a word with Ildefonse Lema like he's saying stop your moaning. Well I have to say that they were at it in all the previous three matches as well really and again as Ildefonse Lema ran forward then he still had to have a word and a nudge with David Beckham as well. Free kick to Andorra it's hit long towards Terry and Ildefonse Lema and Lema just platters into John Terry and the free kick is instantly given free kick to England on the edge of the penalty area. There's not great motivation though now is there really in this. Zero. No three nil England lampal on the ball but there are more international goals here for individuals as well Beckham would love one I'm sure. Wolcott who just has that hat trick against Croatia Wolcott dancing down the line four Andorra players around him now five Wolcott's taking them all on and the end the ball goes behind the line and it's a goal kick once more to Andorra. Yeah I think it was Synergy wasn't it who stopped him. Lots of energy but no synergy. And Catello stands and surveys the scene. They say farewell to the squad until August the 12th when they play a friendly match away to Holland and that's even before the Premier League season starts. How nuts is that? Three days before the Premier League so the Premier League managers get players back for five weeks then losing for that week absolutely crazy. Which was another reason why Gus Hiddick really could not be in charge of Chelsea next season because I think Russia are probably playing on night night as well and there are qualifying games by the way being played on that night in England's group. Here they come again lampard this is five live England three Andorra nil Beckham that's a great ball from Beckham. Ashley Young has it and Cole immediately runs forward Ashley Cole for England turns it back header from Defoe is wide might have had that on target. Yeah great play from England starting with Beckham's long sort diagonal ball but when the cross came into Defoe from Ashley Cole he seemed to get his angles wrong didn't he? Yet another clearance for Caldo. Robert Green just stands on the edge of his penalty area. I did put it to Fabio Catello yesterday one of the chances of Paul Robinson coming on and playing at centre forward for you this evening bearing in mind that Stuart Pierce did the same thing with the other 21s it's not going to happen. Now Crouch again on to Ashley Young trying to provide down the left hand side Young's falling Crouch goalkeeper spells it defender clears. Justin a good play by Ashley Young just needed a touch didn't it that's all it needed from Crouch to con staccato a long right leg but just couldn't quite get the touch in. Johnson that's a poor one in this time from Johnson doesn't clear the first defender and then cleared and then cleared straight back to England. I'm not sure Andorra have really crowd cheering because Robert Green's got his first touch just about I think of the second half hasn't he outside the penalty area. Number four, number four. Ball now to Ashley Young they're certainly feeding Ashley Young whenever they can down that left hand side interesting ball into Crouch Crouch just nudged away by Defender Valets back again to Young once more Young to the ever unmarked Ashley Cole back into central midfield and Beckham Beckham looking for Defoe full stretch was our friend Ildefonse Lima and Andorra are struggling really to get this ball out of their own half they are building through midfield they chip it innocuously forward Lescott is there and now Glenn Johnson again it's just relentless Andorra try and clear they don't hold on to it back come England once more one more change Fabio Capello can make if he wants to I'm sure he will. Lampard Beckham lets it run through his legs and it's Johnson again just inside the Andorra half England three Andorra nil Beckham in this role that he really covers in central midfield Lampard's chip forward Defender Jamea managed to head it out of the penalty area the centre forward is there silver and that's just wretched I mean just looked up to see where the nearest white shirt was and gave it straight back to England and Beckham England on the ball once more with Lescott it's Jermaine Defoe left hand side what the earth must the boys of 66 be making of this one-way traffic game England building on the edge of the Andorra area the drums beat around Wembley Beckham thinks about the shot scoops it into the penalty area Crouch acrobatically fires it in off the defender for a corner kick yeah great ball from Beckham great vision just dinked it over the last defender initial first touch by Crouch on his chest and then there's something must have just got a touch on it all you're doing here though now really is giving players international experience there's no way that Fabio Capello can genuinely assess anybody here as the corner kick is knocked back almost to the half wayline to Ashley Cole by David Beckham Beckham now ball into the area oh and Lescott almost got on the end of it and there's again it's gone wide and it's another goal kick second chance for Lescott she scored in the first half with a header and and again right foot volleyed it just looks like he wasn't watching the ball all the way through he wasn't might it wasn't a corner either mate 58 minutes gone and it's a sort of end of season ball really that it's I think Graham Taylor said earlier it's like a sort of testimonial for somebody at the end of the season I've seen better testimonials than this we have another word from Graham in a moment as cold oak clears it won't stay in the England half for very long as Lescott is there again and back they come should be more than three nil really if you're going to be hyper critical Beckham and he's just picking out the passes once more onto Ashley Young's head it wasn't a good header though by the Villa player but he's immediately going to try and win it back over on that left hand side putting pressure on Merano now the pressure on the fullback and Andorra give it away Beckham was almost in Andorra just smashed it out a player on the far side and Graham Taylor anything new to tell us not at all it's it's a continuation of England's domination as they had in the first half and it's really just a question how many goals are England going to score I think they've missed two or three opportunities already in this half but that's all it is it's just watching one side completely dominate another side thank you very much Graham again Ashley Young with the ball in and again it wasn't particularly well delivered the new player Valais is there and it's out of play over on the far side throw into England three nil they lead almost an hour gone here at Wembley and the ball is with Ashley Cole too young yo young goes around the defender high one into the penalty area header from Theo Walcott that's glanced off the defender nobody seems to know where it is it's spinning away for a corner England corner near side and that means Beckham will come across from the center to take it now here's an opportunity surely from a set piece to make it four and the crowd stand and cheer David Beckham Beckham sees Lescott and Terry moving forward and prepares to take the corner kick he glides the ball in towards crouch two defenders get in ahead of crouch Beckham now with a chance to float another ball in can't clear Ildefan Sleemer though but it'll drop now to Young again on the left side of the penalty area young with the fullback Ayala cross coming in it can't once more defeat the Andorran central defenders Glenn Johnson caught in possession on the edge of the penalty area Ildefan Sleemer has been pushed over he won't like that and that's a free kick to Andorra now raise up two poor crosses by Beckham in all honesty for a man of his quality thing is though when it is just so easy like this you do become lethargic don't you yeah send me play of you free kick to Andorra and we've played now 61 and a half minutes of the game we're going to make another change they're going to make another change why can't they wait till Greeny takes over clearance to the far side of the field ball drops inside the England half they've only got one man down field Andorra and it doesn't stick with him and Johnson clears and now Walcott's got room down the right hand side the near side of the field crouch at the speed now from Theo Walcott who remember is going off to join the under 21s in Sweden Walcott hits the defenders backside ran a long way with the ball there to win a throw in by the corner play bridge is coming on with whole Wayne bridge so bridge to come on for Ashley Cole I assume I have think it's Robert Green throw in taken for England and John Terry finds Frank Lantar Lantar goes around and nothing challenge shoots goalkeeper Paris it comes out to Walcott and the wall caught hits crouch with his shot I'm not sure whether it was going in but crouch made sure it wasn't going in Walcott perhaps should have done better as well and it's another goal kick and I think that was going in right where's Wayne bridge I can't see I really I really do so Ray Clements is down there trying to sort things out Crouch he did well to stop it you could play for Andorra at the back and bridge will come on to win his 33rd cap here he comes number 14 a referee's just shown a yellow card to Ildefan Sleema oh and that means he's suspended from the next game is it what a result he's had four yellow cards in the group so he's out of the next game so if he's at home he misses the trip to Barcelona it's not good planning is it and Ashley Cole's international season and football season is over and now that this is nice because remember the abuse that Ashley Cole got here against Kazakhstan but now there's a good cheer for him he has such a great end to the season with with Chelsea and he really has finished in top form and Wayne bridge is coming on just to get a bit more of international experience here you got the shake of the hand from mr capallo as well Ashley Cole ball back again on me towards the edge of the Andorran penalty area Ayala is tidying up it's gone into midfield bustling forward with no great conviction is Vieira still Vieira they're all running away from him Vieira out to the far side and it's Vieira again but no not really very much on for him marinho immediately squeezed and pushed back by lampard then carted forward towards silver outcomes Robert Green oh it has to make a tidy save with his knee count and uh i'm just trying to but you know i'm just trying to sell it for Robert Green here don't you find it's called interception yeah interception and Beckham now again with another inch perfect pass for Ashley young down the left hand side young flies past the fallback now what's the cross like as Defoe's trying to stay on side ball comes in Defoe hasn't got it in goes lampard hit it off the line but the offside well that was Fred carno in the end that was bouncing around how it didn't go in i'm not sure and in the end and offside and a free kick for colder clever play by Ashley young passed the fallback and a couple more turns and hit a real low hard cross i think it was defoe just couldn't quite get any angle in terms of knocking the ball back in towards a goal well it's not going to be a record score for england at wembley there was you know the build up to this inevitably we've been reminded of some of the big scores they've had in days of yore but three nil at the moment and we're moving towards the halfway point of the second half rune got two before the break lampard got the other in between the two rune goals rune departed at halftime defoe's come on to partner crouch and the ball is out of play over on the far side and andora had a throw in and nobody wants to take it in the end it's left for Ayala Ayala of the orange boots yeah not the Ayala who was terrific for argentina a few seasons ago the defender alongside telegrino um ball is with england they've got a free kick they've taken it already and that's good refereeing because the referee knew that it wasn't taken from the spot but he just wants the game to continue and david beckham's now rolling through the center circle beckham on to to walcott walcott's just looking to see what johnson is he's just behind him feeds glenn johnson defoe and crouch in the area hasn't reached the area yet now it might johnson's got the ball at his feet plays it into walcott walcott and that was good defending this time for mandora they concede a corner yeah i got played by walcott because he already started off the move just just took a took a better position up in the penalty area where he could have just turned maybe a little bit quicker and got his shot away it's going to be 21 points from seven perfect games under fabio cattello in terms of results england just would need one more victory to qualify england goes a corner kick and that's john terry arriving late to head it wide i mean they could have had four or five in the second half mark yeah just got a knock on the head john terry but he won't need any treatment so the next qualifying game and what a different atmosphere there will be as well when crewisha come here remembering how tense it was in that final game under steve mclaren but um i mean it would be a scenario where england won they were through then well that that possible depend they're also they're also qualifying games being played before then which which could make it even easier for england come that match against crewisha yes is the answer yes it's possible i think thanks but i haven't been up all night checking out that one sorry sorry norris nearly 67 minutes gone in the second half england three and oranil and that was the half time score johnson of england walcott down the right available johnson though looking for the foe to foe slipped as the ball was running through to him and again caldo the busiest man in the andoran team picks up the loose i'm not sure he slipped mate i i just think he just failed to control it well i've got a touch from the defender in fairness to the foe but it's a good run i'm not sure if i commentate for another 22 and a half minutes i'm going to get a goal it's one of those nights are here's alan green it's been wonderful with you this season michael thanks for the coffee no england on the attack down the left side it's bridge who plays the ball in a diving header clear by uh ildefond's lima i think we can drop the christian name now there's only one lima on the pitch here's beckham beckham 40 yards out onto johnson and now walcott beckham again and he hits it unerringly crossfield towards bridge bridge on the volley plays it back to lescott i mean look there isn't a player within 20 yards of david beckham he gets the ball again it's it's so easy beckham chips it towards crutch headed clear by lima and now it should be uh hit the safety by andora that's the person andora not the team andora but honestly look at them they are pitiful yeah there's there's just no defense of this they haven't attempted to attack they haven't forced to save they haven't forced a corner nothing what what are they doing playing at this level they should be pre-qualifying lescott onto bridge on the far side of the field left flank good balling towards the near post and a good clearance by lima i'da play it goes for a throw in the number to call on 606 is 0-500-9-9-6-9-3 and uh the netherlands are beaten norway 2-0 you know that i'm being correct you know the netherlands as opposed to holland the team that reached two world cup finals here's johnson johnson moving forward a crude challenge by sonny g england still of the ball world cup passes to faulbott score a remarkable save by coldo though he was offside was it offside coldo wasn't to do that no good save by coldo wow um there've been so many challenges three nails just ridiculously unflattering scoreline bringing he was indeed offside we're just seeing a replay now it was terrific save wasn't it was for a man playing his last game and he should be good all the practice has had playing fran doren the goal well i think he's been the star player for the last six seasons david pleat was uh was saying to me before kickoff that's because he's been doing more than anybody else in the pitch he can't give it to the striker england three and doran else is five live at the bbc and we've got 20 minutes of our season to complete and it couldn't be easier here's to faul good pass to the left side and ashley young who jet to deliver properly from that flank approaching the penalty here and has he over hit the ball he has crutch couldn't get there and it still kept them played up by walk on close to the corner flag back to glenn johnson and perhaps fallen over injures who is it it's lima yeah inside the penalty area he's looking for sympathy look he's lost a tooth look at my tooth look at my mouth he says to the referee and he oh dear they're they're blaming crutch they're blaming crutch well let's see we're gonna go replay now laughable i mean crutch did push him away but did you see the response of lima dear oh dear visit a dentist why doesn't he grow up what what is his age by the way he must be about 30 or more than that grow up yeah the thing as well with england though that just makes sure they don't rise to the bait that's the thing which which is why alan you don't want to give any sympathy whatsoever to andora for them for their antics i wouldn't sympathize with them at all no not at all every time i've seen them they've left the same impression they're useless and they try to kick the opposition he was smiling then off camera yeah i'm afraid he's just not a very nice man i'm not talking about him as a player he's just not a very nice man clearly from the way he behaves on a football pitch uh wallcott runs it away from sonny g and then uh wallcott hits it into the defender rebounds out of play and it's a throw in to england uh beckham takes it to wallcott he's unmarked back to beckham who hasn't got anybody near him the whole of the game into lampard center of the andor and half uh lampard must see bridge no doesn't plays instead to uh defold now it's wide to bridge down the left flank and the cross deep looking for crotch good catch for the gold keeper caldo how many minutes more have you got to suffer with this 18 and a half 6 0 6 will be a blessed relief folks trust me oh 599 6 9 3 what do you want to say not sure about that beckham i'll have radio tune on the way home oh thank you very much oh lovely wallcott to johnson johnson onto his left foot and he thought that wallcott was going to keep running forward but it comes off the awful sonny g and behind for a corner under no pressure whatsoever no no took today it's unfair that the only um can play 11 players on door maybe 15 and then i wonder you know if you gave him the option of playing in a pre-qualifying league with all the other i think they probably take it uh corner take it here's johnson johnson's cross to foe with a header four no way good three crosses from johnson through the goals on very good and that was a much better header from germain to foe 18 minutes to go england four and dora now i just think he's been the star of the show glenn johnson just got real quality on the ball short corner came in went across it left foot back on his right and just stood it up for the foe as he eases the chances i what's going on here beckham and cherry talking to the referee i wouldn't be surprised you know if they're saying to the referee look can you not no do something about the attitude of some of these andora players i think they've declared uh seven jarrett has now uh pursued and he applauded that goal from germain to foe grand taner how you doing what are you thinking i'm doing all right alan just woke up a little bit and told me they've scored a goal again it's a very good finish by the foe there's no doubt about it andora went to sleep when the corner was taken cross put in back of the net and it's just repeating ourselves beckham towards wall cut wall cut trying to pull the ball back for uh defoe undecected by defender and it's another corner to england and there's you know realistically there's not the two or three goals of the water here good ball by beckham yet again as well awareness from uh from wall cut as well just couldn't quite get the crossover the thing about david beckham you know playing in a central midfield i mean could he honestly play him there no against serious opposition no but he knows that and can pallidus beckham's corner right footed it's another poor corner headed away i mean we really should have better delivery from beckham but i'm sure it's a it's a concentration factor in terms of some of the poor passes he's given now england's still on the attack wall cut trying to squeeze the ball through he's being fouled and here's a free kick in beckham territory again 30 yards of goal well the good thing from beckham as well if he takes it it is in the middle of the goal so see interesting see what called who does once he lines the wall up man they're probably 14 in the wall and see which side he stands behind well he's um rubber greens having his boots repaired i think he's having them tied together to give andora's guns he must be bored right free kick for england 30 yards of goal quarter far to go points already won four nil in eight will it be five beckham plays it in no goalkeeper's fun and it's knocked in it's another goal for germain de foe twice in just a couple of minutes england five and dorenil four centre fours will tell you get six to eight goals a year from that position in off the goalkeeper jimmy greaves will be pleased with that cindy foe score it it wasn't the first time in the game that called is just spilt a ball rather courageously beckham's free kick was it very central it should have been easy for the goalkeeper he just said he pushed it out and said there you go have another goal well there wasn't even a great place on it all right it bounced just before him but not good no not good no you'll have the operation next week to have his hands sewn back on there is no limit to the laurel jokes tonight inside the final quarter of an hour you'll see the five line with the bbc and england if they want to can hit a record score line in terms of a defeat for andora seven nil and eight one their previous heaviest defeats they're treading five nil here 14 minutes to go at wembly and it's been a decent crowd i don't know whether it's absolutely accurate but nearly 58 thousand despite the tube strike wallcott crosses on the volley from the right hand side koldo gets that great ball again from beckham under no presses it's a bit like a quarterback isn't the way he's playing in this match really i saw i saw paul sculls do something similar from manches united earlier this season against fulham when fulham just lay down at old trapper and no one made a tackle on sculls and sculls was just sitting in the center midfield spraying passes everywhere pinging the ball everywhere it was because it was it was easy there was an tackle on him i think in american football they call it the shotgun position don't they don't know don't watch american football and know even less about it than you might even think here's johnson into wallcott wallcott right out of the penalty area close to the goal line keeps possession turns can't beat the defender sonny g and it's run away and do you think they're even getting tired andora terry to crutch amazing the crutch has scored and that's on the far side of the field with actually young uh young back to beckham beckham go more than 30 yards out moves forward beat one defender lays the pass to wallcott wallcott had crutch on the far post to lay the cross now he plays it in actually young brings it down a young trying to run through ball breaks up a defender to crutch and back now to bridge into beckham should they say beckham declines instead trying to play an inch perfect pass into the fold that tackle and walk on walk on get this finish handed crutch on turning in wallcott should have gone down for a penalty and i will say put the cross in for kraut and i think hit kraut on the knee if it goes down it's a penalty yes it was a bad tackle file tackle anyway 12 and a half minutes to go i i still looked at how uh kraut didn't convert the cross in from wallcott beckham with a from the left hand side the drums beat it wembley beckham plays it in right foot a deep kraut heads it behind for a goal kick and here's another change for andora uh finandez will come on and i don't care what um or where he's supposed to play he'll defend doesn't matter you guys give that line had you heard the drums finandez and we've only got another 12 minutes of mark rodts and seized as well goodness he lives five andora nil by the you know there's much of the little bits that are written about me in the press i'm absolutely no basis impact whatsoever but there was one in a bbc in house magazine recently an editor who claimed that he saw me on a yucca slav beach never in my life it was a whale never never in my life have i been on a beach in yucca slavia charles ronsi if you're listening sorry that's in but you know i couldn't let it go without rebuke for the relevant magazine here's the era the era running which was the far side finds a colleague in red now it's played back to andora uh to aya on the halfway line and you know they've actually got half of us and players lurking around the england penalty and then they get the ball away it comes out of walk up and it's a throw into andora we've got 11 minutes left for play just watching the andora manager david rodrigo on the on the touchline what on earth can he be thinking or trying to do it's well i tell you what he doesn't have to do very much because he's been in the job 10 years i'm not saying he just tried of course he works hard but uh sort of seems to have a successful record oh great run forward by the four he's on a half trick remember into the penalty shoot so it was wasteful still might be not good cry jacksy scores after a cleverest defensive attempt by andora it's england six and dora nil yeah i think the firm made an absolute pig's ear of it and well he did he screwed the shot wide and it seems to put the defender off i think it was sunning here as well who then wasn't quite sure whether to stick or twist and crouch has had an almighty hee-hoor at it and completely almost missed it they just trickle past the goalkeeper honestly you've got to watch that goal on television but anyway peter crouch finally scores um and it's england six andora nil of all these goals waiting are you up graham or have you nodded off just woke me up island just woke me up sorry peter crouch peter crouch there that could have been his fifth goal really he's got it in the most remarkable way but there you are they keep on coming will they get to this double figures will they do it i think that's the challenge they ought to set themselves four goals in 10 minutes yeah i think that's possible against this side it's possible it's possible here's beckham to lampard and onto bridge in the far side of the field i just sense that england i'm looking for further goals now actually young onto his right foot per cross in from the villa player it's beaten away then it's given away to actually young again another per cross from actually young this one's behind for a goalkeeper actually i didn't think the second cross was that bad it was just low and it was it was there to be attacked as much as anything just seeing a shot of sygep hirst in the crowd um you see now win reningo pass them in terms of even goal scores and you know eventually you know sygep hirst got a knighthood you might find um sir wane some stage in the future could be record caps record goals it deserve it it's a long way off though actually young on the far side england left england lead by how many goals is it now six six now almost lost count of the number of goals easy just wondering about my i don't think i've ever seen england win by a mammoth of mine i don't think mike has either i mean i've watched games in television seven or eight nil ones i didn't do that game i didn't did mike do it not mike if you did it did you do it did turkey mike no seven or eight nil yes i did right i didn't do that hey all done he's just writing the scores down now lay off him come on we're going on our summer break we're all going in the summer holiday together back i'm spot to goalkeeper off his line and definitely struck it towards goal didn't quite get the trajectory right at any way cold out breathing heavily uh re gained his position and caught the shot eight minutes to go england six and door and l here's lescott uh lescott he could have scored two goals himself onto beckham beckham over the halfway line in the center circle just chips the past to the left side to wane bridge bridge with actually young head of him played to young young looking at aya already runs towards the left edge of the penalty area then the pass in fields on lampard lampard good ball forward to crutch crutch wide to bridge typically defo probably the smallest first on the pitch is the only person inside the penalty area now crutch joins him actually young attempts to get the cross in very deep walk cut is there it seemed to be walk cut pulling on the defender not to put up other lines with another referee johnson crosses in towards the far post headed up and away by andora and finally out of play off the head of aya for a throw into england seven minutes to go england have now scored 26 goals in this campaign seven games seven wins ain't half bad here's beckham beckham to the right side and johnson johnson now turns it on to his left foot quite a provider tonight glenn johnson the pass i think inadvertently back to beckham the crowd shout shoot he declines instead the pass is to bridge bridge runs in field back to beckham should ignore it again sure it's shoot well it's something like that let's go with the cross deep looking for crutch crutch was ready to bully it came off the head of a defender uh shea ma and behind for an england court he's probably never taken so many corners and free kicks in his life david beckham no if they're not shouting shoot what are they shouting no no suggestions in that mark 0599 693 is the number to call if you wish to participate in 606 which is coming up shortly beckham's corner played in again it wasn't great uh terry tried to reach it didn't reach it and ill the funds lima that mcnevisen defender comes forward falls over at least he's not trying to start a fight now it's just a free kick even he accepts the inevitable oh a booth in the crowd there and i think we're going to have another change for andora uh i wonder will it be marrera or rodriguez rodriguez perhaps it's good change again oh you could bring on another goalkeeper free kick taken viera onto him and his him and his into viera again back now to valets and it's on the far side of the field with ayalah and dora actually have more than a few players inside the england half now a viera did shoot it was half-hearted effort came back off an offender now it's crossed by ayalah deep looking for him and his and johnson just allowed the ball to run over his head out of play harmlessly for a throw into england i think they've had one shot haven't they and dora remember the first half left foot was it marrera or him and his i'm not quite sure beckham drives the ball to the left side ashley young chases after it controls it left edge of the penalty area crutch goes to the near post is ignored ashley young plays it over hits the ball and it's behind harmlessly for a gold king yeah he hasn't made the best use of his time in the pitch has he ashley young no but he can see he's got the ability alan and the great thing about him he can go either side of the full back as well or is this look it's a goalkeeper well of course it's caught at the end of coldo's career obviously he's getting the applause so he's going to get the standing ovation coming off or the just the way tony lemak got him by the clan in fact are there any and dora and fans here they mean not there must be a few they're just not much in evidence four minutes to go england six and dora nil beckham to wallcott wallcott 15 yards over the halfway line moving in field then played it rather courageously behind the foe and it's taken forward by andora well if you the error tried a couple of stepper who was there and then he had a hack at lescott who was on the floor play continues beckham as the ball another good crossfield ball hit 50 yards ashley young taken on the chest by the villa player back to Wayne bridge bridge uh to young and now it's on from terry to beckham back to terry glenn johnson already half created three goals with crosses from the right in towards lampard lampard miscontrolled it but it's back to john terry terry hits it to the left side to bridge bridge brings it down a few yards outside the penalty area back night he young countless passes exchange here between england players three minutes to go here on five line now it's beckham down the right side and beckham just rolls the ball with the underside of his right foot plays the pass back to johnson terry onto lescott what is the full time terry chips it in toward the foe too high for the foe and through to colby yeah we're just killing the game really here aren't we like colby just hit the ball out of play and then you can be substituted well he hits it over the halfway line that's for sure uh young controls doesn't want to go off does he maybe he doesn't know that the coach is inviting a standing aficionate i think i think the clue of the goalkeeper as in substitute standing on the line might be a clue uh defo finds actually young down the left side young moving in field before he crosses low right footed and headed behind for a corner is this where you make the change before a corner yeah he's gonna do it does a mind six no down does it come on here we go yeah gilmer's coming on for coldo and you know he's obviously held in very high regard by his international colleagues because he's embraced um by quite a few of them i think he wants to embrace all of them before he makes his way off the pitch uh an unusual substitution this and wow he can understand absolutely absolutely you know some career i think you know he's giving the captain's armband a sonny g he takes john terry's hand as well it'll be one of the longer substitutions we've seen but it's the end of his international career and you know well done he and tony lee and well done the england fans because they're applauding the goalkeeper they must be aware of this standing ovation on here in front of us that's very good so colo's off and he's embraced by tony gomers who replaces him and now i hope from the manager david rubrigo as well he's off and gomers is on and i fear for gomers i hope we just could see the goal here late england corner taken short by beckham to young back to beckham and beckham's crossing not a good one again and andora should be able to make the clearance here caught in possession though in the middle of their own half lescon back to the halfway line in bridge all to beckham we're inside the final middle of the game beckham just chipped the ball into the penalty area too high for devoe and an elaborate catch and dive forward by the substitute goalkeeper gomers he looks very young as well gomers i don't know i i'm afraid i've got to admit to a relative lack of research particularly on the andoran substitutes i thought i'd just give it a miss wall cop running forward and running inside the full back i've been another player but not a final challenge ball broke back to beckham beckham still played a good pass to the left side to ashley young ashley young crosses in to fall with a header over the crossbar when a hat trick beckham just needed a little depth touch really got a little bit too much on it then that's it he's blown the whistle forget about the substitutions broganard on any unnecessary time that's your lot thank heavens good way to finish 6-0 against very very poor opposition played 7-1-7 excellent record for capello put this result obviously to bed for the rest of the summer and roll on the start of next season if you're an england supporter well in a couple of minutes time i'll be presenting 606 a reminder of the number to call 0500 909 693 do give me a chance to get to the fresh position so mark it's all yours final score at wembley england six and dora nil",
