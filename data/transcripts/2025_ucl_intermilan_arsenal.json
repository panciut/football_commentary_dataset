  "transcript": " players break away take up their positions for the start of the match in all of these Champions League matches this week all of the European matches the victims of those devastating floods in Valencia and the surrounding areas as well are being remembered so here we go Inter against Arsenal both undeaten in the Champions League they've both got seven points and neither Inter nor Arsenal have yet to concede a goal in the Champions League this season there is the whistle from the Romanian referee Istvan Corbac and a very positive start from Arsenal kicking off and immediately launching an attack down the left wing that Martin Ali the ball eventually coming out out of him and it's a throwing to Inter level the edge of their own penalty area just looking at the Arsenal line-up Havertz very much in a centre forward position he is as an interesting start wasn't it was like quite a progressive positive pass right from the kickoff wasn't it played through into that wide area with timber bombing on but you're right John Havertz has taken up that position right between the Inter back three and here is Havertz but the ball bounces away from him and then there's a foul on Zilinski a lot of the referee with Inter in possession allows Inter to play on and they eventually play the ball back to the veteran goalkeeper Sommar there's lots of experience in this Inter side in actual fact this season they've got the oldest average starting 11 in the Champions League but in this team tonight 6.30 something as Terrami dives in and is fouled and it's a free kick to Inter inside their own half that Laotaro Martin is going to take it was Gabrielle just a little shove in the back on Terrami yeah got a little bit tight I mean I like the way Gabrielle does go and get really tight two players he won the first one then it came back and he just had his arms around the back of Terrami I'm not sure if it was a foul but it certainly looked like it here is Terrami the Iranian world cup player we some score twice against England in Qatar Inter swinging the ball right across to Dumfries Dumfries should he take the ball it bounces out still a chance for Zilinski left side of the area but his little chip dripped straight behind that was rather a ways from the Polish international but what a shot from Dumfries I have to confess I thought that was goal bound and it came back off the underside of the bar what a strike brilliant strike with the right foot from Dumfries on the right hand side corner of the 18 yard box the ball makes its way out to him he has a touch Timber doesn't quite get tight enough and he just hits it full on with the laces right boot little bit of the outside of the boot to it and it just swings round nothing nobody touches it rattles off the crossbar and back into play well that's a let off for Arsenal after the recent difficulties if they conceded a goal in what was the third minute as they come forward again and now a shot from Trinolu from the best part of 25 yards that had Raya diving down to his right and that was not far wider the foot of the post a shaky start from Arsenal was in it out of possession not quite getting close enough not enough of a bite in the tackle two efforts on goal now from Inter and you can't allow the kind of space they did for Pocano Logli on his right foot he's got a lovely right foot it would shoot from anywhere within 25-30 yards so that's Matthew Upsen former Arsenal and England central defender were here inside San Siro as Gabrielle just heads the ball away and Arsenal now and poor touch from Marino that gives possession back to Inter to Reini just knocked it back into his own half and now the ball is in the corner of the boot and it's a five-live you can listen as well to the live radio to five live you'll find it on the BBC Sound app if you're on the move and we're also keeping you updated on the decider the third one-day international between the West Indies and England we'll get an update shortly but here's Martinez, La Taro Martinez the Argentine World Cup winner to Dumfries on the right and it bounces away out towards the far side where the Arsenal captain, Tokai Osaka wins a throw in for the visitors so West Indies England Daniel Norcross is monitoring it I am and England have just lost a wicket they've lost their fifth the partnership of 70 has been broken Sam Curran's skydorn up in the end the ball did absolutely nothing it was full and it was straight and he went for the big heave it went straight up in the air it was caught by the substitute Hayden Walch who's out there because Alzarri Joseph seems to have left the field for reasons unknown Curran out gone for 40, 52, England 98 for five after 27 overs OK thank you Jan Arsenal with the ball deep inside their own half as the ball is played right across the edge of the penalty area but Arsenal are able to deal with that and it's played back to Gabrielle who turns it right back to Raya just a couple of yards off the goal line and Arsenal do play it out long in the end from the right back position from Ben White but it was beyond Havertz and Inter have got it back on the edge of their own penalty area so Inter 0 Arsenal 0 I hope you're enjoying the sound of the Giuseppe Miata the drums you can hear them the flags are waving in the middle tier to our left it's all black and blue the Nereth Suri of Inter Nationale and now here is Disseq the left-sided German central defender who carries the ball long down field and then gets it back and in the end it was just took away instead of playing by the back tracking Bukajosaka for throwing to Inter down the left Inter've starved brightly haven't they certainly went Arsenal in possession if Raya has the ball or the two centre backs they are pressing high midfielder cushion in they're going to really apply a lot of pressure in and around that area hoping for a mistake from Arsenal I think that's going to be key tonight while you want to play and have the ball and move the ball and be brave with it you've also got to be careful you don't turn it over in bad areas and I think Inter are really looking for that little transition of play whenever they can press remember how in the first match in the group for Inter you might have been listening that night the Etihad Stadium how Inter were so well organised a tactically brilliant display and now Terrami and Lautaro Martinez between them there were defenders back there as well in the D eventually they were too close to one another and the ball deflected all the way through to Raya who's given it out long to Martin Ali Martin Ali with two Inter players eventually he carries the ball over the white line just in front of where Simone in Zagi is standing darkly dressed with his black hair hanging down and it's out for a throwing to Inter I thought Martin Ali could have just knocked the ball in behind DeVry then as DeVry came outside to the right side of the pitch from the centre back position big hole of space in behind in Martin Ali for me just knock it in there and run he's not going to cope with him for pace but he just tried to bring it down and DeVry came and applied pressure and won the throwing just with good pressure really but Martin Ali has to run him in behind Dumfries takes the throw it comes back to him and then Marino rather a strong challenge as the two of them jumped together he's caught Dumfries I think with his shoulder as they jumped together and Dumfries has collapsed down onto his back and the referee was quickly across he's given the free kick but I think it's only a word of warning for Marino He looked completely pollux there didn't he Dumfries I thought he almost knocked him out it was not the best time challenge from Marino he's never going to win the ball it was bouncing up in the air he arrives really late actually I think Dumfries does well not to actually really connect badly with either his head or his shoulder yeah so it's a free kick to Inter that is touched by Chalonoglu to Zilinski and now Chalonoglu with a low crossing towards the near post that is cleared away by Havertz back inside his own penalty area again it's the Turkish international Chalonoglu Zilinski takes it down into the Arsenal left full back position where Martin Ali just gets something on that to fraud it out for another throw to Inter although he felt that it should have gone the other way but the Romanian assistant was very decisive gave the throwing straight away 745 matches are have been underway for some time still Blackburn Nils Stoke Nils Coventry Nils Derby Nils and Millwall Nils Leeds Nils and we've already brought your commentary on Aston Villa's defeat in the Champions League tonight Dumfries with the throwing which is headed away by Party on the edge of the six yard box Marino then nods it further away Arsenal with their their returning club captain Martin Odegaard among the substitutes tonight without Declan Rice here that was the big news yesterday that the Declan Rice was not travelling because of a foot injury wasn't able to put a boot on this week so this is just the third match that he's missed for Arsenal in all complications this season so Inter winning another free kick second field just a high foot from Party a free kick to Inter over on the left hand side Nils isn't too sure why the referee gave that I mean I think that it was almost an anticipation from Bissec that the challenge was going to come in and there was a lot of contact at all but the referee appears to be happy to be giving plenty of fouls Inter playing from left to right as we look here from right over the halfway line staring down on it Chalannoli plays the ball out towards the left hand side back to the Bissec and then back to Steffen De Vrij the Dutch international central defender in the centre circle Inter keeping possession of Marino tries to win it back but it just runs back into the Inter half Underway as well in the eight o'clock kickoffs in the championship Luton Niel Cardiff Niel and let's hear how things have started in the match involving the leaders Sani Roderavagelat Well Preston North End Niel Sunderland Niel ten minutes gone but Preston started really brightly and Kane Kessler Hayden Lone from Aston Villa missed from two yards out huge chance for Preston goal us at the moment Preston Niel Sunderland Niel And that has been an early goal in the country Derby match and it's the visitors Derby who are winning 1-0 with a goal from Derri Yates Also to the den Millwall leads both sides very much in form Aaron Paul Absolutely Niel Niel leads just starting to flex their muscles a bit Aaronson and Perubos forcing decent saves out of Lucas Jensen in the Millwall goal Wilfrid Nonto has seen a curled effort cleared behind by Jake Cooper Millwall Niel leads no 26th goal So no goals yet in any of the eight o'clock kickoffs in the Champions League and this is a red button night by the way Champions League final score is in action so you can listen to the 5-5 commentary on there and watch the did it printer with the graphics and the analysis That is via the red button the iPlayer BBC sport website and app just click on Champions League final score and you will find it all there Inter Niel Arsenal Niel and then to have had the better of it so far Matthew Upsett Yeah they have they just look more comfortable the more assertive team Arsenal not really got into a rhythm at all with the ball and caught out once or twice defensively as well Dumfries with the shot that hit the crossbar so it hit the lower part of the face of the crossbar and came straight back out Dumfries now lifts it forward but then the referee has given another free kick this is for a tug by Kimber He's not shy blowing his whistle giving a foul is he I mean I think it's a little bit both to be honest but Timber the one penalised Yeah I think it was more aggressive from Timber he had a real handful of the front of his shirt So Inter go all the way back to their former Swiss international goalkeeper Jan Sommer as he is now seven clean sheets in ten Champions League appearances for Inter All the way at the back it's played across by Pavard the French World Cup player Then to Sommer out into the left back area that's where Damian is another of the 30 somethings 35 next week the former Manchester United man Damian Arsenal have the ball back they're in the red shirts with the white sleeves and the white shorts and red socks Arsenal have only been here once before in the European Club competitions to play against Inter and it ended in a famous 5-1 victory in which Edu was one of the goal scorers that week We are all teammates who's very much been in the news this week He really is isn't he I looked at that game earlier and I saw that he was on the score sheet and a quite magnificent performance from Thierry-Honry that night I mean there was a few in an Arsenal shirt but that one actually really did stand out I remember it well Yeah it's got a very special place hasn't it that one in the hearts of Arsenal supporters I'm sure some of them who are up there high to our right would have been here that night as well Three down after the first leg wasn't it? That's right as Inter break away with Dumfries on the halfway line plays it forward through for the run of Terrami although parties gone with him Maybe works in the cross but there were two Arsenal men there on the edge of the six yard box Excellent work from the Iranian I thought that was a lost cause but he very near he found the pass to Martinez I thought party just got too tight there almost I kept thinking don't foul him you're going to trip him up in the box and he just gets too tight and allows Terrami that little bit of space just to get the crossing Excellent play there though from party and now Arsenal are able to break Trossard Now here's Saka into the action for the first time the Arsenal captain in the absence of Odegaard kicks on Bisak is able to get the cross over but Bisak just stuck out of foot and deflected it behind him We have the first corner of the match to Arsenal Yeah first time they've been able to get the ball out to Saka with any kind of space to run at Bisak he doesn't really do too much of a skill he just slows him down then goes again on the outside It would be nice to have sent him trying to cut inside on to his left foot to see if he actually had the beating of Bisak which I think he has on a 1v1 Such an important night tonight for Arsenal in the context of everything that's been going on Lose here tonight the manner of the defeat then you know that is a you know what the headlines will be But if they're able to win put in a fine performance then everything settled down still waiting for this corner to be taken but Martinez has been shoved over Or at least he's gone to ground Gabrielle came together and Gabrielle shoved him in the chest and of course Martinez flopped down on to his back He did push him away I mean I'm pretty sure Martinez didn't need to fall over And Gabrielle can't believe it He put his hands on his chest I've had a fit right since the start of the game I've had a feel with this referee I've just already mentioned about some of the fouls he's given and okay They're not ridiculous decisions but you know you just fill your early on in a big game just let it flow a little bit No one's complaining and let the game breathe and he just for me that yellow card there just tells me he doesn't need to get involved in that the referee Yep yellow card for Gabrielle and for Martinez corner then eventually finally it'll be taken this is one of those where the Arsenal players are grouped together at the back post Sacker with the delivery deep deep deep Havertz heads it back across the box but then it's headed away for Interf. It doesn't clear the penalty area down in the right back area Martinelli is on to this Martinelli turning and still just keeping possession and then playing it back to the Spanish international Marino the summer arrival Marino works it to Timber now Martinelli with the outside of his right boot it's flicked on with the head of Havertz But Inter are able to clear that and actually look to get the ball up towards Lautaro Martinez six goals in his last eight games but excellent from Arsenal Dispossessing and now Sacker again receives possession the step over from him back centrally to party now on the edge of the box that was a heavy touch there from Trossard Just when I thought he might have a chance there perhaps to have a shot at goal but it ran away from him and now Inter run away with the ball over the half way line with Dumfries on the right hand side Passes Mikael Arteta who is standing in black and grey claps his hand above his head because Arsenal were quickly back into position unable to force Inter to go back to the half way line After a cagey start just opened up a little bit there the game a little bit more exciting got the crowd up Arsenal with an opportunity Inter on the break and now it's very much back in that tactical steady moment Arsenal back in shape very much a 4-4-2 quite a rigid system and Inter knocking the ball around We do now have a couple of goals in the Champions League tonight in the eight o'clock kick-offs at least It is Red Star Belgrade, Nail Barcelona one, Inigo Martinez for Barcelona and PSG a one-nil up on Atletico Madrid Warren Zaire Emery the goal scorer Here's Martin Ali for Arsenal Martin Ali still goes gets the ball over left footed, crossed to the back post, Damian is there to head it up It doesn't quite bounce out of play and in fact Trossard got there first and Damian had to put a foot in as the ball rolled towards the corner flag and it's another corner to Arsenal so it'll be interesting to see here Matt you know the referee having put down a marker and effectively said if we see pushing and shoving inside the area you know I'm going to take action Yeah I mean fair enough but you're right early on in the game I think getting a yellow card out you're putting both players in a difficult position now for the rest of the game just a talking two would have done but you're right if he's going to do that then he's got to keep an eye on everything Corner then and again we have the two players Marino and Gabriele near the penalty spot meant four others now running across the six yard box in it goes but it's headed away for Inter very congested Martin Ali with a shot into a crowded penalty area there's an Inter player who's down actually sitting with his legs on the pitch but he's his bottom in the net and the referee's stop play so he can receive some attention Inter nil Arsenal nil and with Gabriele getting that early yellow card and Arsenal having already received three red cards this season which have cost them another thing they don't want tonight No it's cost them big but I tell you what when they swing a corner in they know how to do that well I will say the delivery was superb from Sackett had pace on it was dropped right in that six yard box area and they have three four players attacking the ball with other players milling around the goalkeeper making his life difficult very hard to defend against Declan Rose of course very important set piece taken they do have options and Sackett is one of them and it's done freeze the player who I think he fell against the post and whether he's going to be able to whether he's going to be alright or not I think it was maybe a bit more of party or Gabriele just landing on him you know that run that Gabriele makes very similar to the goal he scored at City where he makes that kind of curving run to the back post I mean everything's into the challenge the kitchen sinks in the way he attacks the ball and I think he just lands on Dumfries' leg when he comes down which is causing him a bit of discomfort Atlético Madrid have equalised in Paris against PSG, Nawell, Molina so it's one-one that one looking at the matches tonight I thought very interesting PSG against Atlético Madrid and two early goals in that match and as I say you're loving this format John Let's not start My personal juries still out on it Inter-nil, Arsenal-nil whatever one might think of the format If you haven't clocked this yet the Champions League highlights are very much on the BBC this season So there will be a match of the day, a Champions League match of the day with Mark Chapman tonight which will be a little later than it normally would be because there'll be extended news on the television after the other Why's that? Yes I don't think I need to explain that And also the highlights of all this week's Champions League matches can be watched via the iPlayer from 10 o'clock Arsenal with the ball deep inside their own half played up towards Havertz on the half way line who was sort of manhandled over and Arsenal have got a free kick for that five or six yards inside Inter territory I don't mind that with Arsenal when you get two or three passes off deep you get impressed Inter can smell that they might nick the ball and then they hit that long one into Havertz, I like that I think it really does bypass a lot of players, it could be a really good ball Ball played forward by White, Saka, that this air is able to just shepherd it behind for a goal kick The other thing as well with all of the various talking points around Arsenal One thing that we didn't discuss yesterday when we were able to speak to Mikhail Atec and Tokayo Saka which we might have done otherwise is all of the accusations about Arsenal and the dark arts this season and here they are up against Inter who you know they are very well versed in all that kind of thing as are all of the top clubs but I think we've already seen a lot going on in this match I think Italian football kind of breeds that a little bit as well doesn't it that's very much part of the culture of that league and also you've already alluded to the fact that the amount of experience in this team and on the bench, I mean look at the bench, what an experience there with Barela, the Mkhitaryan, the Cherby I mean DiMarco, big players that have played in big moments and big games I don't know how to manage the game and the gamesmanship may be a factor here tonight Inter nil, Arsenal nil, Arsenal up against the Italian champions Last night Liverpool gave the German champions what for didn't they? The Premier League champions lost to the Portuguese champions and there is Timber, he's in on the challenge and he's caught fracasi and that's another free kick and in the first quarter of this match it has been littered in the proverbial sense with free kicks foul after foul after foul, I mean some of them are justified, a couple have been a little bit soft and I think Timber is making a genuine attempt for the ball, I think Mareno is a little bit late in the tackle just before then it's a little bit of an indicator that Arsenal aren't quite at their sharpest I wouldn't say they're doing okay but it's not a confident Arsenal start to this game at all Inter nil, Arsenal nil and we will have more European commentary for you tomorrow night on 5Live Sport we'll have all of the British and Irish clubs covered but there will be commentary from Old Trafford on Rud van Nistelroy's third match as the Interim so Manchester United against Pauk will be on 5Live tomorrow night, that is an 8 o'clock kick off back to Preston Sunderland, Sani Rudra Vagela Preston nil, Sunderland nil 24 gone north end are giving the leaders some real problems, Emil Rees the latest to miss with a header but it's still goalless here, Preston nil, Sunderland nil I think just the one goal so far in the five matches in the championship, Derby's goal at Coventry which sees them lead 1-0 the ball is played across the back line by Pavard to Somat, long left footer clearance from him headed on by Lautaro Martínez, a lovely touch from Terrami and it's Bisak who's marauding forward the central defender to the edge of the area, the cover was there though, good work at the back by Gabrielle coming across Gabrielle and Saliva just exchanging a low five there Bisak, I wasn't expecting him to arrive in that position No, it was strange how it came about, I mean, I think initially Saliva and Gabrielle got a little bit muddled up both went and competed for the high ball which left a massive hole over on the far side and Bisak from left side centre back position just got forward and it just opened up for him for a moment there We're going to Millwall in a moment but Inter have got the ball 30 yards from the Arsenal goal but they go back into the centre circle so an opening goal in what I think is the match of the night in the championship Aaron Paul Millwall one leads, Niel Jaffet Tanganga breaks the deadlock here really good work by Jake Cooper just able to latch onto the dyag, heading it across goal and there was Tanganga catching the ball in the half volley and just stabbing it home past Ilan Melia, no chance of the leads goalkeeper getting to it Millwall one leads Niel, 40 minutes on the clock One nil to the Millwall, here's Martin Ellie into the penalty area for Arsenal but Inter have got men back, gets the crossover, Bisak is able to head it down and he's headed it to his team-mate Chalannoglu, yes Millwall have won their last three matches by one goal to nil Here's party, there's another team who used to do that, doesn't there? Here's Martin Ellie, used to do that, Niel Niel would be a fine score I think tonight for Arsenal Timber plays it in over, everyone, Saka the player close, says to it that Damian was right with him and it is a goal kick, nil nil I'll tell you the discipline of this Inter team is impressive, isn't it? It was a brilliant move there a moment ago, Saka does so well, wins the ball, gets it out wide to Martin Ellie side You think normally he's got this space, he's going to be driving in, he might have an opportunity to come inside Well, there were three, four blue and black shirts racing back, blocking off channels They're very clever, the angles where they run back into defensive positions They know exactly what lines to cut off, how to stop players like Martin Ellie coming inside I mean it just shut up in front of him, completely the door closed from a really promising situation I mean it's just, the whole team's very well drilled like that Yep, they are by Simone Insargi who I don't know, will we see him in the Premier League one day Here's Saka down the right-hand side against Bisak into the area, left foot shot but it's straight at Summer He had his feet wide apart there and was able to drop forward and just scoop it up securely Yeah, that's what you want to see Saka do, he walks away, he's frustrated with himself, Bakaio Saka He has the space, he drops his shoulder inside the pitch, gets half a yard on Bisak and he just doesn't strike it clean enough with his left foot You normally see him bend that one into the far post and he just kind of scuff the ball a little bit Along the ground, simple save for Summer Still, nil nil, yes Simone Insargi was saying yesterday that he has had offers in the past to move to England I'm sure he has He said both at Lazio and here at Inter that he says that he is happy where he is but no one knows the future He is just Italian football though, wouldn't he? You know, when you see him, you know I've got memories of him growing up, watching him play He just shouts Italian football, didn't he? Yeah, and as well, I know I was speaking to a couple of the regulars who follow Inter and they were saying that the language, English, is actually a bit of an issue with him Right And I think that, you know, if there is a reason, of course he can work on that He has Saka to Havertz, forward of the centre circle, Kimba has Inter dropped back into position in the striped blue and black shirts, black shorts and black socks Martin Ali right footed ball in, Summer comes for it And not sure, did he get anything on that? I mean he has collided there with the Arsenal man Yeah, I mean that, I mean he's I mean he smashes Marino in the side of the head, I mean I don't think he gets anything on the ball, Summer It's a bit of a 50-50, right ball in I think he's been given as a corner though, hasn't he? Yeah, it was, his gloves, his fists and Marino's head sort of came together at the same time as the ball arrived And the final touch was off the goalkeeper's gloves wide and behind for a corner Teasing cross, wasn't it? Martin Ali on his right foot, in swinging cross, Marino arriving in the box, which he does really well, gets up well Like I said, there's a real collision there, gets a big fud in the back and ahead from Summer It's okay, he's not having to leave, you know, he's not receiving any treatment, which is mildly surprising It's a corner then, Martin Ali in right underneath the crossbar, but the whole group of players there, Inter were able to head it partly away And then actually it's won by Cialanoğlu, but the party's able to get something on it Trossard's going to try a shot from distance, 25 yards, but it sails away over the angle of Poston Bar by probably 5 yards Red Star Belgrade have equalised against Barcelona, it's 1-1 And Vumpa with the equaliser for Red Star Belgrade 1-1 in that match, Nilnil here in Milan, in the dressing room side of the ground The outside of his boot, Pavard plays it forward, Martinez trying to get there, party back in midfield Then White back at right back, Audegarde is on the bench, whether we see him tonight, I have my doubts I don't think he could get on the pitch tonight, he's not done anywhere near enough work after being out for probably 2 months And it could take a little bit of time for him to get back up to speed to be playing and competing at the top level But his presence in the dressing room and with the group I think is very important And then Declan Rice, Arsenal have the ball just on the half way line The fact that he wasn't able to get a boot on this week, Arsenal with Saka, Saka has got the overlap there from White It was blocked away by the defender and then Fowl off the ball by Saka as he tried to play it back through for White And it's a free kick to Inter on the edge of the box We don't know the details obviously, but if he couldn't get a boot on this week Is it possible that he could be available for Sunday? It's never that great when you don't hear the details, that's what I think of it It's not too clear what the problem is, which for me sometimes feels like you don't, like I say, it could be anything Inter-nil, Arsenal-nil, normally you're very good medically Well I asked you the question I'm only with hamstrings There's Marino, who always gets a mention, doesn't it, Mike? Every game we do this again You might get a mention on Sunday when you and I are covering Chelsea against Arsenal as well One of the five lives premier league matches this year Although you don't like to run around the land, do you? It's not your favourite city to run around, is it? It's not my favourite city to run around in Free kick to Arsenal inside their own half, and it's going to roll all the way back We're going to go to one of the championship games in a moment or two, but Arsenal Take it forward, Gabrielle Gabrielle, but it's headed away An out of play for a throw into 10 yards inside their own half It is half time at Millwall Aaron Paul It is Millwall one leads, now the host ahead via a quality finish from Tanganga Despite leads dominating large parts of the half Aronson, Pirro and Montauv all had chances But Tanganga on the half, volley means at the break It is Millwall one leads now It's a nil, Arsenal nil An untidy match and another free kick for Inter Martinez has gone down And Inter after the earlier chances that they had and the early pressure It looked as though that was going to set the pattern for the match Don Fries for the shot that hit the crossbar and came back out And the effort from Chalannolle that was narrowly wide But since then Arsenal have settled very well I would say Yeah, I agree And in the last 10 minutes they've got a lot more confident They're pressing a lot higher up the pitch They've had a couple of chances, they've isolated Saka once or twice Which is important and Inter can't get going at the moment And it's not a particularly brilliant game, is it? No It's headed forward by Zalinski and then Mesefail The referee's not helping The referee's not helping, I mean they asked the room Clear possession of the ball there Just play off Every opportunity is stopping it It just doesn't get the flow and the rhythm It doesn't help the flow and the rhythm I have to say I didn't think Manchester City 0-0 was a great spectacle No, earlier in the season You were at that one I suppose, but quite a number of people said to me in the after-match What a marvellous, tactical contest it was But I have to say it didn't get me off my seat Inter 0, Arsenal 0 And Arsenal going all the way back to Raya But we cannot get away from the fact That if Arsenal get a 0-0 draw tonight This sort of 0-0 draw, that's a really positive result It is, it would be a big job done To be honest, to come away from here with a clean sheet would be amazing There's a point thing for Aston Villa earlier I would imagine we'll hear from Unai Emery At half-time in this match Klobruz, the Belgian champions Winning 1-0 against Aston Villa Which has put the blocker on Aston Villa's Very good start back in the Champions League David Raya with the ball on the edge of the area In fact we're going to hear from Theo Wolcott at half-time We'll obviously have a view on what's happening here in Milan tonight with Arsenal He's on match of the day tonight with Mark Chapman He has Havertz down the left-hand side Insagi actually runs out of his coaching area Quick little steps down the touch line Clapping his hands as the two players continue down the left wing Arsenal could it back, bring it back more centrally Out to the right-hand side now with White Party, Thomas Party just waiting But Inter have got everyone behind the ball So it's tapped back to Saliba And then again to Party Football at walking pace now Inside the Inter half It is your classic cat and mouse In a European match Here's Timberdome He takes possession on the left-hand side He came in, Zagi goes running away Little steps down the touch line He's way out of his coaching area He's trying to get some information across Martinelli is in possession of the ball Threads it between two inter players Timber back to the edge of the box Where Ben White had come all the way across From right back almost in the Inter right back position It's a little time to actually look there Is that actually Ben White in the Left wing position from right back Dunno how he ended up there to be honest Party now, near the halfway line And then Saliba Now Trossard has taken up a position On the right-hand side, ball played across But it was cut out by the diving Lautaro Martinez and then at the back Givry is able to win a goal kick For Inter of the Kaio Saka Who has just gone down on one knee No, he's okay, he's quick, he's back up on his feet He's running back into position It remains Inter 0, Arsenal 0 10 minutes to go to half time Kagey, you can just feel it, can't you Neither team really kind of letting loose Having a go, it's not a swing for the fences Kind of matches it, it's very Okay, we're just going to sit here All lose the ball, let's drop into shape And then we'll wait and we'll be patient And we'll get a few passes often There's not a lot of real drive or forward energy In this match so far, both teams Appear to not want to give up their Clean sheet in the Champions League Bringing the half time scores in those other two matches In the championship as well Where it was Blackburn, Nils Stoke, Nils And Coventry Nils, Derby 1 Arsenal have a throw in, down the left hand side And Timber just chips the ball up into his hands And waits to take this As a throw in, steals a few yards Down the left, and then takes the throw To Marino, who's running back towards the half way line Uses Gabrielle, and then Arsenal go all the way back To Saliba, David Ryer As well out of his penalty area He receives possession and then hits it long And right footed downfield That's chested down by Havertz There's got Sacher available And then Ben White joins in as well Comes back to Trossard, nearer the half way line Trossard, the Belgian is able to Put his foot on the ball and actually Haven't looked at the play ahead of him But it's almost static So it goes square to Timber now And then Timber out to the left hand side Which sets in Zaghi off down the touch line again And then Martinelli against Dumfries Right footed Tross, he's got real whip on that Comes off and into head, De Vrij and Bissac Going for the same ball and it bounces behind For another Arsenal corner from the right It is Blackburn Nils Stolt Nils at half time And also Coventry Nils Derby 1, half time I mean it's another great ball from Martinelli With his right foot in swinger Really whips it, difficult to deal with But Inter have got great headers in the ball In that situation, De Vrij, Bissac They're coping really well with those deliveries And a lot of the time Havertz has been drawn out In the build up, so he's not quite getting Into the middle of the six-yard box to attack those crosses Covent, four Arsenal, again Four men beyond the far post Two men near the penalty spot Any moment now, they'll all begin to move Which they do Saka, left foot, it takes us into the near post It's blocked by a defender party Stabs it across the six-yard box, cleared on the edge of the area And then into, knocking away a downfield Where Arsenal will have it on the half-way line We've got a number of the English writers around us And the question is being asked Whether Arsenal should have had a, maybe a shout for a penalty When Summer came out and punched the ball But also Marino I think he got a piece of the ball though That's what I thought I thought it all came together at the same time Yeah, it was one of those where they collided at the same time It was a corner, so obviously it came off of his hand Which would tell me that he's got a right to challenge me That's what I would have said But, interesting to see it again in the light of that Still goal is here in Milan Aston Villa losing 1-0 And Kimba is pulled up for another foul On Dumfries, latest in a series on If he's not careful, the next one's going to be a yellow card I think the referee just pointed to like three different places on the pitch Where he made fouls, he's probably on his last warning They take the free kick back towards the edge of their own penalty area Inter And Chalunoglu back to Somal with his long hair Right footed clearance headed up in the centre circle by Gabrielle Heading it forward for Arsenal But then Zilinski is able to lift it back into Arsenal territory It's run back by Fretese And now Dumfries on the right And his cross is stretching, header away for Arsenal Zilinski back into the box, lifted across by Fretese And then arriving on the edge of the six yard box Terrami was there, but he was under pressure And he could only stun headed over the top of the crossbar Ben White does just enough to put Terrami off It's very difficult when you're in that full back position The ball's lofted overhead, you're back-heading You're at such a disadvantage to really compete for the ball When you've got a centre forward coming onto the ball With all the momentum ability to jump But he just used his body quite well, Ben White He doesn't head the ball, but jumps into Terrami Puts him off, doesn't allow him that clean contact Into nil, Arsenal nil As Trossard plays it forward for Saka Saka on the edge of the area, now Trossard on the right-hand side Trossard's ball across, but that's cleared away on the edge of the six yard area By Pavard, there's an enhancement there for the Arsenal supporters I couldn't quite hear what it was that was being said to them Arsenal have got it back with Ben White Now, they've got more of the possession in the match It's about 53% possession, I think I saw just flash up on the screen for Arsenal But they've not really extended summer in the goal Besides that incident that we were just talking about I think what one effort from Saka into the near post was it there But it didn't really test him at all Arsenal will be happy with this opening 45 minutes or so I think they'll go in at half-time, relatively pleased They've been settled, they've kind of grown into the game Yep, they have, they've had a measure of control And here's Saka now, Saka moving in field Square pass all the way across to Timber who's come up from left bank Martin Ellie now on the left-hand side, Martin Ellie Drags the ball back, Timber's behind him, Timber curls it in And summer, I mean it looked to me as though he was about to catch it And suddenly changed his mind and punched it away Still inside the penalty area, Saka looks for White White's ball across, comes off Damian and loops behind For another corner to Arsenal, strange decision from Summer Bizarre choice, wasn't it? The cross came in, it was so low John, wasn't it? It looked a lot harder to punch it than catch it And he's probably punched it down by his waist almost Try and clear the ball, it was a deflected cross So it had a bit of a loop to it But still you fancy him to be able to just claim that It was strange one Corner then to Arsenal, I see Brest have taken the lead Against Sparta Prague So that is another excellent scoreline for Brest Brest have really made quite an impact in this Champions League Corner for Saka Left for it, and it goes again into the six yard box Comes off the head of Pavard, which took it beyond the far post Another Arsenal corner, but this time it'll be from the left hand side Those deliveries are causing problems And Arsenal know that if they keep putting that ball in the right area Asking the question, something's going to land Something's going to drop at the feet of a player Or they're going to win that first contact and cause a real problem It's really bringing back memories of that match at Manchester City Who saw lots of this, so much And they defended stoutly And here they are again Martin Ali this time from the left hand side To, I'm sure again, drop it in there Into that busy six yard box, there it goes Actually towards the far post it is And the header It's another corner Yeah, came off the defender at the back post And it's another corner to Arsenal A third consecutive corner Saliba who was challenging it, and everyone's arms went up Appealing for that one, the referee, good look with that The trouble is that you win that first header And it's kind of, what, just in the replay It looked like it came off Saliba's head actually Yeah, it was Pavard who was challenging And then I think Chalannolu Was, well, he was delaying the restart And the referee has come across and had a word with him But that's all And it is another corner So this is Arsenal's seventh corner of the first half And it's their third in a row This is back on the other side Saka to take this, left footed in swinger In it comes again, chip to the near post Header from Gabriel, but that took it right across the six yard area Arsenal still with it, Martin Ali runs it out into the full back position Nil Nil, if you've just joined us on BBC Five Live here in the stadium In Milan, Timber, back to Martin Ali Martin Ali against Dumfries gets the cross Into the penalty area, Bissec heads that away On the edge of the six yard box And into Mike Brick here, Dumfries playing it forward For Martinez, Lautaro, Martinez Against Saliba and Martinez goes down There wasn't much contact there But it's a free kick that's been given And you can hear the crowd up, pressuring the Romanian referee It's sure yellow card to Saliba I think it's just going to be a free kick It's not a yellow card, it's barely a foul It gets across really well, Saliba It covers the ground so quickly Martinez was never going to get the wrong side of him And he does make contact But then Martinez just dives on the floor Tries to get Saliba in trouble But the cross from Martin Ali that led to that breakaway Again, the quality was really good He's putting it in some really good areas, Martin Ali Martinez, when he went down, was waving the imaginary yellow card Which the referee resisted Free kick then for Inter into the area It's a penalty, it's a penalty It's struck an Arsenal arm and the referee's given Inter a penalty It was a strange motion from him And then he tried to flick it forward I think it was, with standing behind him The ball's cannon into Marino's arm And the referee instantly said penalty, Inter Well, I just can't get my head round how this can be a penalty I mean, in the Premier League I just don't think it is Well, I know for a fact it isn't because His hand is in a perfectly natural position, Marino And the ball is skimmed off the foot of Terimi That's two yards away coming at pace You can't get your hand out the way And you're in a natural position In the Premier League it just doesn't get given as a penalty It's ridiculous, really And now Arsenal have to face a penalty from nothing I mean, literally What can you do about it, Tom? And your hand is in a perfect normal position At a right angle Anyway, it's Cialanollo who's got a brilliant record Penalty taking record They've already scored a couple of goals this season One of them from the penalty spot Cialanollo waiting Right-footed penalty standing one foot in front of the other The Turkish international Raya remembers his penalty save Against Atalanta That brilliant penalty save Arsenal holding their breath They've yet to concede a goal In the Champions League this season And Raya has actually walked off the line The check's still going on The VAR check It says on the screen that the check's still going on Even though we're ready to take the penalty It looks like the referee's still speaking Right, Cialanollo Now to take the penalty, right-footed Raya doesn't save this one The ball's in the back of the Arsenal net For the first time in the Champions League this season And the Italian champions have the lead here A very harsh award of a penalty There really wasn't much Marino could do about it He just couldn't get his arm out of the way But a penalty for Hanford It's been converted by Cialanollo And in added time at the end of the first half Arsenal are behind into one-nil The San Siro erupts, doesn't it? The noise around this stadium When that ball hit the back of the net was deafening And it's just a shocking call from the referee Really, Inter haven't particularly deserved it Arsenal in the last 10-15 minutes have been the better team They've been applying more pressure And it's just a crazy decision from the referee To award a penalty for that And a player of his quality And the calmness and composure that he has You felt the ball was always going to hit the back of the net And he didn't disappoint You do feel for Marino? Really, there's something It wasn't times crazy For him to get his arm out of the way With the ball in his flake To Reigny had his back to him That's the last action of the first half And that's a real blow for Arsenal They whispered the early storm Dumfries, his shot hit the crossbar But had control for much of the first period But then an incident like that And I'm afraid that just sums it up for Arsenal at the moment When a decision like that goes against them Absolutely, I think it's just the run that they're on And there's nothing they can do about it They've got to go in, they've got to regroup And the trouble is that to get something from this now They've really got to be a bit bolder, a bit braver It's been a KGO first half Neither team really wants to give too much away And Arsenal are going to have to change that approach In the second half And throw more bodies forward And get more players in the box for short So there we are, the players just leaving the field There have been a number of goals that have just gone in In the Champions League And a back in front, Lewandowski scored again Feyenoord, Nill, Red Bull, Salzburg, 1 And half time here in Milan Inter are 1-0 up on Arsenal after that Chalanollu penalty right at the end of the first period Well, Marina has been involved in an incident at either end And if you're summing it up, you know, it's a penalty If it hits your hand from less than a yard away But it's not a penalty if the goalkeeper punches you in the head Yeah, thumps you in the back of the head I mean, yeah I mean, that's just nonsense, isn't it? We've got that... It does my head in chapters, I'll be honest with you The way they apply that law in Europe I mean, we're miles ahead of that in the Premier League In terms of the referee's understanding of proximity Speed of the ball, natural position of the arm and hand All of those things were tick, tick, tick in terms of it not being a penalty Because you apply that logic, you know It's just a bit of common sense into the picture And the referee just hasn't done that And he's not been great with me right from the start of the game The fouls he's given, the bookings of the two players He could just speak to them It's not been a great first half from him And it came at the end of the period where Arsenal had dominated, really Or certainly taken control of the game Yeah, I agree, they settled into it Started to have more of the ball, Martinelli, who's been very bright Put two or three really good deliveries into the box with his right foot Moreno's been arriving in the box, they've loaded corners, more pressure And Inter, really, no threat whatsoever It was going into half-time, Arsenal probably in the driving seat And in a good position, now it's completely changed So the English team this evening, behind to a penalty Arsenal, they trail into by a goal to nil earlier this evening Asked to Villa, the other English team in action tonight Beaten by a penalty as well, and a bizarre one Emi Martinez took a goal kick and Tyrone Mings picked the ball up So the referee awarded a penalty Bruges scored it, here are the thoughts of Unai Emery He's completely strained this mistake It's the biggest mistake I made in my career as a coach Because we can make a mistake in our build-up But we accepted it and we are working to try to control Of the games through keeping ball possession and trying to stop the opponent We did the first half fantastic, fantastic We lost some one or two balls but we were always in our position to recover again the position But this mistake is very strange, but it's not for Tyrone Mings It's not for Emiliano Martinez It's one mistake that's strange, I think it's only happened one time in all my life today Yeah, Steve Warner watched this as part of the Champions League highlight show later on On Beamside, it was bizarre, wasn't it? Very odd, I wondered at first whether he'd made that decision to pick it up Because he felt like he was under pressure And it was just because there was a player in the box as well But when we look back on it, he didn't The other reason I thought he might have picked the ball up was because he hadn't been looking at Emiliano Martinez And he didn't realise that he played the pass And what you so often see at the moment is you see the centre half taking the goal kick and then he passes it to the goalkeeper So you just wondered whether at that, just a lapse of concentration He'll be very disappointed tonight, Tyrone Mings When you watch Villa tonight, how do you judge Villa over the last three games? Because the three games have all been very different, whether that's a Champions League game, a Premier League game away at Tottenham Or a very changed team against Crystal Palace in the League Cup Yeah, I don't really judge them on the League Cup game because they had to make changes or they felt they did I think they made nine changes on the night, which is a lot of changes to make I think the disappointing thing was the second half against Tottenham They just capitulated completely, one shot on target in that game And then tonight really poor, really sloppy in the way that they played A team that, and people always say this is lazy, but they did look tired It looks like that lack of rotation has hurt them at the moment Goals have tried up as well, haven't they? Yeah, goals and opportunities created as well, trying to penetrate through the back line to make sure that you're creating opportunities He tried a little bit different tonight to put John McGinnon behind, Oli Watkins He tried Morgan Rogers out on that left hand side, it didn't work, so he flipped that back And then Morgan Rogers, who was potentially carrying an injury coming into the game, wasn't quite at his best But it just seemed that Oli Watkins was very isolated in the forward area Do you think he's quite sure what he's doing in the wide areas at the moment in Emery? So the Tottenham game, for example, you have McGinnon on one side and Ramsey on the other Who essentially are through the middle players as well, aren't they? Leon Bailey doesn't seem that much in favour, Diabe was like, the wide men haven't really fired for Villa No, I think the Tottenham game in particular, he's probably gone for two centre or midfielders Who were able to get back into position, defend, he knew that they'd be under a lot of pressure I think the ideal balance is that you get one midfielder who can then outnumber a midfielder And then you get a wide player on the opposite flank, but one of the problems with that is that you know that that one player is your outlet ball So for the opposition, it's a little bit easier to defend against, but he's got to try and find a better balance at the moment I think they lose a lot of sort of matty cash down that right hand side, being able to bomb forward as Rikonz is a little bit more of a centre back Doesn't really want to come out of position too much, so the emphasis on today was a lot on Leon Bailey And he's a very much a confidence player Stephen, for the moment, thank you very much, you can see that bizarre Villa penalty incident on the iPlayer from 10 o'clock The Champions League highlights tonight on BBC One from 10 to 11 John Bennett has been across the other games this evening, some interesting stories developing Yeah, Paris Saint-Germain won, Athletic Ohm Madrid won, we talked about this as the game between two teams are underperforming so far in the Champions League compared to their standards Athletic Ohm Madrid made a really sloppy start, Marc, awful defending, Dembele won the ball back in the box, Clem on Longleay caught in possession and Warren Zaire Emery dinked it in But then just four minutes later against the run of play, Molina equalised for Athletic Ohm Madrid, good finish after the ball ricocheted to him But Athletic Ohm Madrid have lost their last two under a bit of pressure, I think they'll be delighted with this scoreline so far, 1-1 What else, Barcelona leading at Red Star, they've been made to work, haven't they? Yeah, Red Star Belgrade scored with their first opportunity to equalise, but they had some good moments in the game All the talk about Barcelona's young players, it's two players in their thirties who have got the goals Red Star Belgrade won Barcelona 2, Inigo Martinez with the opener, heading in a Raphinea, Ball Raphinea is one of the star players in the Champions League this season And Lewandowski just before halftime, Bress amazing form in this competition continues, they've been on 10 points as it stands, it's Sparta Braga Nyl Bress won Feyenoord Nyl, Red Bull Salzburg won, Red Bull Salzburg have been awful so far in the Champions League, that would be a huge result for them Stuttgart Nyl, Atalanta Nyl, and Bayern Munich against Benfica was delayed 15 minutes due to travel disruption, and that is Bayern Munich Nyl, Benfica Nyl Thank you very much, let's go round the games in the championship halftime at Deepdale between Preston and Sondland, Sany Reds Vagel Goalless, Sondland are the leaders but it's Preston who've been peppering them across the first 45, Asnabula Looney, Kane, Kessler Hayden missing a huge chance just 90 seconds in, two yards out And Norfeng bookended a half full of opportunity with Emil Reis' effort from the edge, stretching every sinew of Sondland stopper Simon Moore Makers manager Reggie Slavery will be glad it's level, you can expect an improved showing in the second, and maybe make Norfeng regret those misses halftime Sondland Nyl, Preston Nyl A little early on we talked about Millwall's good form in general in the championship and it's continued this evening at home to Leeds Aaron Absolutely 57 and a half minutes gone here at the Den Millwall 1, Leeds United Nyl, the line still leading through a really good Jeff at Tanganga strike At the end of the first half, the Leeds have come out and they are trying to get themselves back into this game Wilfrid Nonto planting a free header over the bar, Dan James has stung the palms of Lukas Jensen in between the Millwall sticks But you just get the sense that Daniel Farkas side, they're a little bit concerned at the way that Millwall counter, they're very, very pacey They've got the energy of Remain Essay and Leeds just retreating back any time Millwall get themselves on the ball Fascinating contest here, approaching the hour mark, Millwall 1 Leeds United Nyl Elsa in the championship, half time at Kenneweth Road and it's goalless between Luton and Cardiff, Stoke have just taken the lead at Blackburn Into the second half at EWIL Park, just shy of the hour, Emilia

it well Weekend mornings On BBC Radio Five Live This is Five Live Sports The Champions League with Mark Chapman Listen on BBC Sound Arsenal Trail in the San Siro by Golds and Ilsec and I'll have commentary on the way before we head back Let's go to the third men's one day international between the West Indies and England And Phil Salt do his best to impress the test selectors Dan Norcross Well he has actually, he's made a really good innings but he's just got out for 74 So a truly stunning boundary catch, we get a bit blasé about these Paul was whacked out over deep mid-wicked and quite brilliant diving catch two handed by Brandon King But as he was diving he was going to go over the boundary line so he had to pass it off Alzarri Joseph was there about four or five yards away he got it to him cleanly It was a brilliant piece of athleticism and it ended a really splendid partnership between Salt and Mosey He did 70 and just as Salt and Curran had done earlier to rescue England from 24 for 4 to 164 for 6 You don't feel like it's enough with nine overs to go the pitch is easing a little bit But they've given themselves a fighting chance if they can get up to 232.40 that could be just about defendable here Jamie Overton's just joined Mosey, Mosey has 36 England 164 for 6 after 41 If you want to follow the cricket Theo Walcott alongside me as we wait for Inter and Arsenal to come back out Now they're behind, you worry about how they're going to break this interside down Given how strong they are defensively in the Champions League I mean to be fair watching the game I've been pleased with the start of you know, Arsenal You already expect Inter Milan to come out in the blocks of course and then they obviously Started to frustrate them by keeping the ball and getting them running You're not as well playing for set pieces because in the Champions League you don't need to play pretty to get results And it's not been really a very entertaining game but as for trying to progress and to get results, Arsenal are doing the right things I mean I think they could have been a bit unlucky with the penalties to be honest At either end Well I do feel like Marey knows his hands in a position where you never really can get away with that particularly with Va these days To be honest it's one of those, if there's no Va you probably get away with that But again it's just the question of you can punch someone in the head and not get a penalty Just besides me because if that's a forward or any other player that's committing a foul on a goalkeeper The goalkeeper is a little bit more protected Look, that's just my opinion but it's one of those where Arsenal do need to show a different side of them if they want to try and get results But look, like I say, I don't think both teams have cancelled each other out Yeah I think it's been that sort of game and I feel like Arsenal will get a result in the end but I feel it's likely to be a draw But Inter can now frustrate even more if they want to, that's the point though isn't it really? It is but you're going to allow pressure for Arsenal to do what they're good at is to, you know, been giving the ball out to Martin and he quite frequently And he's been getting a lot of interesting balls into the area but of course then off the back of that they're getting a set pieces And we all know how dangerous Arsenal are on that so look, Inter Milan can't be too negative in this way They need to start like they did but look, it's one of those where, you know, I feel like it's going to be a bit of a stalemate sort of fixture right now going to the second half Theo, thank you very much, let's head back to the San Sierra, by the way, the half-time whistle has gone at the Allianz Arena Bayern, Niel, Ben Fieken, Niel after that first 45 minutes I think Arsenal may be making substitutions, here's John Murray Yeah, a change for Arsenal having fallen behind right at the end of the first half And it's Michele Marino, the unfortunate Michele Marino who is involved in the incident in both penalty areas Michele Marino who is taken off at the break and Gabrielle Gézous comes on for what is his 50th appearance in the Champions League And so a little bit of a re-jig, Matthew Upsen as Inter get us underway in the second half Yeah, and it looks to be Habertz dropping into the midfield area, see, UEFA were right, John They were spot on with their formation And Gabrielle Gézous taking the centre forward roll with Trossard off of him And I think from what I can tell from the start of this half Habertz will just drop in a little bit deeper with Thomas Parton So, Inter, 1, Arsenal, Niel And Inter, as they started the match with goalkeeper Summer as Arsenal come forward with Habertz just outside the area He's able to prod it to Martinelli who shoots from an angle into the outside netting And even though he had half an appeal for a corner there, the referee was having none of that And was as decisive about that as he was of the award of the penalty at the end of the first half Yeah, he was very sure about that, wasn't he? The start's been good from Arsenal the second half, very bright Just there, and there's so much to play for here, I mean, yes there's a disappointment to go behind But this team has got so much to offer, it's got so much energy going forward as well, Martinelli and Saka wide I think they're key in this game for me, if they can get them isolated, get them working at the wide centre-backs Or in that wing-back position, they've got a chance of creating something What did you make of what Theo Walcott had to say at half-time about the Arsenal shout for penalty We've had another look at it at half-time when Summer comes out and punches the ball and punches Marino as well He does punch him in the back of the head, I mean, it's difficult, Marino's kind of backpedalling a little bit And Summer's coming onto the ball, he can see everything Marino probably gets there first I would say, and then there is some kind of glancing touch off of the goalkeeper Now I think that touch just makes it harder for it to be a penalty Well this is going to be tough for Arsenal now from this position, 1-0 down And Free Kick hit long into the edge of the penalty area where Bissec just folly'd it out of play for a throw into Arsenal Down the left, that Timbac is taking, level of the edge of the penalty area, takes a throw and again comes off the head of an inter defender And don't freeze, stretching for it, heads it and it bounces out of play just to the right of the corner flag as we look at it So up to seven corners in the first half, here's the first of the second, but Inter have defended them really really well Yeah they have done, and that is a real strength of Inter and they're going to need to because Arsenal do deliver many games of masterclass of corner organisation and delivery Down in that corner where there's a huge blue square behind as Arsenal take the corner from the left hand side which is taken in by Martinelli But it's over everyone inside the box, it might have just got a glance off the head of Saliba, just misclined it really and it just glanced off him through and behind for a goal kick on the other side It was free to get contact, he just misread the flight Saliba and he's in reaction after, he's kind of patterned himself on the head as if to say what am I doing, why didn't I just make better contact with the ball, he had time to Simon took a touch there inside the penalty area with Gabriel Jesus, was in on the inter goalkeeper and that is given as a free kick That was a big chance that header, it was, it was a big chance and Saliba knows it, it was you know worked perfectly, all the players had gone to the near post, they'd drawn the inter defenders underneath the ball and he was backpedaling for a free header and just didn't judge it properly Now it's Inter trying to play it out from the back, Saka puts in a challenge on Bissec who mis-controlled it but Saka has fouled him, Saka's just feeling his lower right leg there but he's helped go his feet by Trossard Inter take the free kick for the referee says, possibly the ball was moving or was it taken in the wrong place? No, the ball was moving, it was the assistant that wanted to pull it back for, I mean let's say it was moving, it was practically still, it might have just had a tiny roll left on it but this is pretty much how this game has been officiated to be honest it's been very jary and stop-start So a free kick for Inter, of course that benefits Inter to take the free kick, you know, there are, breaks up the game, slows down the game, that's not what I'm talking about That's not what Arsenal want and as it's hit long and forward it's played out by White for a throw in to Inter down the left hand side Champions League action live from Milan inside the Giuseppe Miata here on a coolish evening, murky evening, very often murky in Milan at this time of the year Damian is going to take the throw from the left, he's got a bit of wind up in this one, the former Manchester United man takes the throw, actually no, he's headed away by Sackler and the referee It's no Tom Tonks, it's no Tommy Tonks, hello Tommy Tonks if you're listening tonight, you covered that match the other night, you were taking this The biggest long throw I've ever seen and I played with Rory de Lap, he could take a throw in but Tom Tonks virtually threw it in the net from the dugout, Inter taking the ball out from the back and then Chalannoglu who scored the goal First time pass forward from Martinez, done free-secros, it just took a touch off the foot of Timber which helped Arsenal because that deflected it through to Raya to pick up Well it's been a game of few moments of world-class quality in terms of passing and technique and creativity but that one touch pass there from Martinez was for me the pass of the game, lovely weight First time comes in to seize the gap between the centre-backs and fed it through in behind, lovely Inter continuing to lead by one goal to nil, that Chalannoglu penalty just rolled it down the middle, Dindias David Raya dived to his left as Sackler plays it in field towards Saliba in the Champions League Atalanta are winning 1-0 in Germany, Ademola Lukman has scored again, what a time he's having there, Atalanta, it was reminded last night of the time when Pep Guardiola said that playing against Atalanta is like a trip to the dentist Here's Gabrielle, now to the left-hand side, played in towards the corner of the box where Havertz gives it back to Martin Ely and then forward towards the edge of the area but Pavard was in position there They've got a job on here Arsenal to break down this Inter team as Inter themselves look for a possibility of a second but Martinez has passed forward from the unrushing Fritaezi in an offside position and Arsenal in any case were able to deal with it Arsenal again looking relatively comfortable, it's been a good start to the second half, very similar in terms of the field, the cage in this both teams really just sitting back, nobody really going for it yet but Arsenal will have to just open up a little bit more as this game goes on Matthew Upsen from Arsenal, an England defender here with us in Northern Italy and then Arsenal with the ball on the edge of the area and another little foul, the same on Chalannoglu And that's a free kick, just a little, I don't know, half of his ankles by Saka, it's not a foul is it? And then when's the free kick? I mean Saka's making that point to the referee, you don't see him that often, not you played in European matches, this is one of those matches, you go away in Europe and it's an exercise in frustration and you've got to manage it, you've got to work away round it, deal with it You've got to accept it, you've got to manage restraint, you know, really be clever with what you're doing and you've got to rise above it to be honest and I think that is the challenge for Arsenal now Important goal for Luton, they're winning 1-0 against Cardiff, Jacob Brown, informed Cardiff under Oma Reza and Barcelona are now 3-1 up against Red Star Belgrade As Inter playing the ball out of the back, win another free kick, this time it's Ben White who is a judge to have fouled Zilinski and it's a free kick to Inter in their own left-back position And then, evidently, Lewandowski scored 2 goals tonight with that latest one for Barcelona, that means he's now got 99 goals in the Champions League, he's third on the list of all-time scores as involved the European Cup and the Champions League, so one more to bring up the centre You'll be able to work out for yourselves who are number one and two in that list Inter 1, Arsenal 0, 5-0 and BBC sounds, Red Button Knight as well, Champions League final score in operation, so you can listen to the commentary alongside the Vida printer and the graphics

Gordon Smart, by the way, will be taking over on 5-5 at 10 o'clock with a round-up full coverage of the momentous events of the day Damian taking a throw-in for Inter, back to the half-way line, so we'll wrap everything up and it'll be on the Football Daily podcast in the morning He has Bisseck, just taking the ball from left to right, the German under 21 international comes back to De Vrij who sends a long ball forward for Dumfries to chase And then that's a free-kick, Arsenal's way for his challenge there, Dumfries on Timber He's clever there, Timber, because he was in trouble and he just put the brakes on, waited for the contact that went down and the assistant referee really bought it and gave the foul White and Saka trying to combine, good work from Zielinski to win the ball back, awkward bouncing ball for Arsenal, but Saliva clears it away These sides separated by just that controversial penalty before half-time Here's Saka now, released by Gabriel Gézous, Saka into the area, right for the ball, what a cross that is, but brilliantly defended By I think it was Dumfries, there were two men in there for Inter as well as the two Arsenal men and Dumfries got his head back to it, facing his own penalty area Still Arsenal low on the left-hand side, here's the cross, left for it, Saka at the back, goes, got his head to it, but it drops into the gloves of Sommer on the, almost on the goal line Who was then buffeted by Gézous, but holds the ball There's a cracking cross from Saka with his right foot this time, really wraps his foot round it and fizzes it, lovely height across that six-yard box line I'm not sure if it was Pavard or Dumfries that got the little glancing header just to flick the ball away of danger, but much better from Arsenal Gabriel Gézous really influential in that build-up as well, held the ball up and got the ball wide to Saka and then got himself in the box So 1-0 Inter continue to lead, and once it gets to 10 o'clock after 10 o'clock, now this season, new for this season, all of the Champions League mid-week highlights You'll be able to take your pick and watch them on the iPlayer, Saka down the right, his right footed ball into the six-yard box is cleared away by Deveray He's actually annoyed with himself because he's conceded yet another corner, and this one will be taken by Saka, this is down to our right Arsenal fans, way up in the top tier, this has been a popular trip, they've come in their thousands here, they've got all of their various banners and flags You can see one big red flag with the Arsenal cannon on it, over towards that far side at the top, way way up underneath the roof of the stadium Corner then for Saka to take this, he's got himself organised, Arsenal as well, same routine, those four men break into the box, delivery to the near post Defenders head and it's blocked by Dumfries on the line, he was at the back post, the man on the post was in position to clear it away That's all it was lacking, that set piece was a player arriving in that back post area, I mean it's the most common place, you're going to score a goal Any kind of goal poacher will tell you that you pick up that back post position and something drops every now and then, and that was perfect for them Unfortunately all the players have made the run to the near post, it was a fantastic delivery, really good competitive jumps for the ball Glancing header to the back post, just no one there to tap it in Another goal for Barcelona, now winning 4-1 away against Red Star Belgrade, and it's Raphinha, the informed Raphinha who scored the latest one Red Bull Salzburg are now 2-0 up at Feyenoord, so heading for their first point of this Champions League group stage Karim Canate for them, and Derby County now 2-0 up at Coventry, Bobby Thomas with the second goal for Derby Here come Arsenal 1-0 down, Havertz into the area, curls it in, and Summer had to be sharp there Gabrielle Giazuse was lurking, but Summer moving away to his right just clawed it beyond the far post for a corner I'm not sure if that was a cross or a shot, I mean it ended up being a shot because that was curling into the far post and very nearly caught Summer out This is good stuff from Arsenal, they've really upped their game a little bit, much more progressive, really on top of Inter at the moment Yep, they are threatening now, genuinely, as they have to inter still yet to concede a goal in this competition this season They've never kept 4 consecutive clean sheets in the Champions League, this club of its great European history In comes the corner, Saliva was looking for it, Inter head are away, then cleared away by Bisak, comes out for the shot just inside the box from Gabrielle That was blocked by an Inter defender, they've got all of the bodies in there Trossard now, the Belgian, 25 yards out, turns, gives it back to Gabrielle Giazuse on the right hand side, Gabrielle Giazuse Then back to Saka, left footed ball in towards the penalty spot, Havertz plays it back out of the area to Trossard Now to the left hand side to Martin Alley, Martin Alley trying to weave something, he's got Timber there to help Timber's right footed cross, chested back, party, party now to Giazuse, Giazuse onto his left foot, shoots That's blocked by an Inter leg, then party inside the area, so congested in there Giazuse now, he's been challenged by Lautaro Martines and throws himself to the ground and the referee does not give the free kick And then, Martin, first strip to Zilinski, that's a free kick to Inter Wow, I don't quite know what to say about that to be honest, I mean, Martines, he gets way too tight in the corner on Giazuse He's all over him, okay, Gabrielle Giazuse might just put the brakes on and draw the contact But it's certainly a foul and then the tiny little nick from party on the leg of Zilinski and he gives a foul I mean, it's been very much that kind of frustrating game for Arsenal, but they've got to keep plugging away They're really on top of it at the moment, they're deserving something out of this game, they have to stick at it With an hour gone, Simone and Zaghi's making a triple substitution And this has to be with the top of the table match against Napoli here at the weekend in mind on Sunday night So Zilinski and Fritesi have been withdrawn from the midfield and the captain Lautaro Martines, he's off as well So Marcus Turan comes on for him and it's Nicola Barella into the midfield The Italian who is part of that squad that won the Euros at Wembley And also the former Arsenal man, another veteran, Henrik Mkhitaryan, the 35-year-old Armenian as he is now Has come on into the midfield as well, the number 22 So changes that I'm sure were planned And obviously as well trying to lift in there in this match at a time when Arsenal have had a good spell match Yes, they need it because at the moment they're just hanging on in this game I mean, they're so resilient defensively, they're getting away with certain things That little passenger play there with Arsenal, the ball could have easily dropped to somebody To score or a ricochet, land at an Arsenal players feet They haven't had that luck yet this evening Arsenal, but certainly you're on the back foot So that freshening up of three players and let's face it, they're not bad players to come on are they? There's a bit of talent there isn't there, Turan, Barella, Mkhitaryan And Arsenal now Have to dig deep here, the ball is on the touchline, way down below us, Mikhail Arteta is on the side of the pitch And he's got involved in that Arteta and it's a yellow card for the Arsenal manager Damian was there, has to say the action was right in front of Mikhail Arteta He's apologising now to the referee but... The ref's laughing, he literally grabbed the ball and I don't think it quite gone out play, Eddie You can't do that No, he couldn't help himself, you know like one of those reactions where it's in front of you Because the technical area line is literally two yards from the touchline, isn't it? You're so close, the managers are so close to nearly being on the pitch that He just wanted to get the ball and put it back into play quickly but it hadn't actually gone out of play yet And now there's a bit of a fuss going on between the assistant What's the restart there then? It's a free kick Well if I had more, by the manager What is that? He's a free kick That is a very good question Anyway, it's been given, they've come up with a free kick which Visec took on the wrong blade of grass So the assistant got him to take it on the right blade I mean this is for the Arsenal fans up there in the stands, they must be pulling their hair out This is a really, really frustrating experience and they'll feel that the award of the penalty was very, very harsh For the handball, the renault just couldn't get out of the way of it And because of that, it's Inter who lead by one goal to nil And we have 25 minutes to play Arsenal with Ben White going back in field to party We'll pass it into the back line to Gabrielle and now Timbac And Havertz has appeared over there on the far side, on the left hand side, almost on the left wing He's got the roving roll now, Kai Havertz having dropped back And that's a lovely pass forward from Ben White for Saka, down the right He's up against Visec, taking it into the penalty area now But crossing into the legs of the central defender, it's behind you, another corner He just kind of resigned himself to winning the corner almost there, Saka He's trying to get the half yard to get across in past Visec, who's defended pretty well against him this evening And he just ends up resigning himself to, I'll just cross it with me right foot, it's going to ricoch out him But we're going to win a corner and that at the moment is Arsenal's best chance of getting a goal Goal back for Coventry, Sakamoto has scored, Coventry won, Derby 2 Corner then, again for Arsenal, Inter, once more, prepare to defend their way out of this Saka into the near post, but that's headed away comfortably, very straight forwardly And then Saka plays it in again, that's headed away on the edge of the box, 4-Inter White heads it back to the edge of the Inter penalty area, that's knotted down and away But it's given back to the red and white of Arsenal, Trossards pass forward Chalonolo step forward, he was able to clear it away, Terremi's involved as well Chalonolo now turning and going back towards the edge of his own penalty area In fact running all the way into the box and drawing timber towards him, gives possession back to Arsenal Party gets it down, party's in danger of losing it, excellent work though by the Ghanaian To keep possession, under severe pressure from Turan and Terremi Now it's to Saka on the right hand side, Saka up against Visec, Damian's there as well Saka plays it in between the two of them and then down goes Havertz against Barela Who's taken the captain's arm band since he's come onto the field And Martinez went off and he's able to clear and in the end it's Visec who wins the throwing Deep inside his own half in the left back area, so 1-0 Inter continue to lead What is the latest in the Millwall Leads match, Millwall still on course for another 1-0 Aaron Paul Yeah potentially they were desperately close to a second just now John Jay Cooper with another fabulous header across goal, Femi Aziz got his head on to the back post That is effort crashing against the post and bouncing away thankfully for Ilea Melia and Leeds United You're still looking for an equaliser, Millwall 1 leads now In the five championship matches you've heard about Millwall There's just a little bit of a flare up centre field, the frustration, the tempers boiling all back And it's a free kick that's been given Arsenal's way and Barela was hanging on to the ball He's been shown a yellow card and so has Gabriel Gézous Yeah he likes booking people in pairs doesn't he, they're at the referee Yes I'd say Gézous is a little bit overreager, he's hyped up and he's annoyed Like I think a lot of the Arsenal players are, they just want to get the game moving into now They're starting to be clever and Barela's just holding on to the ball after he tried to win a foul It wasn't a foul, he grabbed hold of the ball with his hands for handball, the referee didn't give it And then the kefuffle happened after but Gabriel Gézous showing that he just wants to get cracking with this game He wants the tempo to be raised by Arsenal Inter still have a narrow lead but Arsenal coming forward again, sackers passing field It incomes the challenge from Chalannoglu, it's kept in on the halfway line, party And just taps it across to Saliba, yeah in the championship, Blackburn Nils, Stoke 1 Coventry 1, Derby 2, Millwall 1 leads Nils, Luton 1, Cardiff Nils are all latest scores We've got Preston in a moment where it was Nil Nil last we heard the match involving the leaders, Sunderland In fact let's do that now because Inter have got themselves another free kick inside their own half Sanit Rudra Vagela Well it's still goalless but it is getting very stretched, Sunderland now, I've got Nils Adore playing in the middle He's looking for a fifth goal at a season but Preston have been holding them and actually looking the stronger side 73 gone, Preston Nils, Sunderland Nils Inter lost possession, Arsenal attack, cross from the left for Saka bit But Inter were able to block his progress and now Turram is onto the loose ball in the central third This could open up for Inter, Turram, tall, carrying the ball forward but Grulton the ball and Martinelli just came across So thanks very much and nipped it away from him and now Arsenal might be able to counterattack Down the left hand side with Martinelli, still going as Chalannoglu I think it was off the field, it's off the field Honestly he's laying there, he's laying on the floor like he'd been hurt and then realised nobody was caring So decided to get up and now he's running around Saka trying to find a way through between two Inter players and in the end it's a foul on Damian and a free kick to Inter I think Nicolae Arter might have said he's either straight out of his technical area or he said something I think it might be a technical area issue or maybe whatever it is, it's something that's not been done to the letter of the law And it's a free kick to Inter who lead 1-0 Matt we're just going to get an update on I presume the England innings is finished now in the third 1-day international Daniel Norcross? Not quite, no it's something about 3.5 overs to go, Dan Mosley though has just got out caught in the bound The slog is on, he's gone for 57, it's a really well made innings, intelligent, highly mature And he's got JB over to complete the other end on 18 but England did feel like they're good enough 2-0 7 for 7 with another 23 balls to go OK thanks Dan who will continue to update you during the course of 5 lives sport I imagine Inter Gordon's smarts programme after 10 o'clock The Albanian international Christian Aslani who's had an ankle injury recently He's come back onto the field, the 22 year old and Chalannoglu the goal scorer has come off So whatever the problem that he had as Borella now plays it forward for Inter comes back to Borella just outside the D Playing it to the right, Dumfries with the shot arriving onto it, went for the spectacular volley that got it wrong And hit it well wider than the opposing It's a good opportunity actually, it just needs to go a little bit cooler on the finish It was looped up in the air like passed over to that farhand side over by Timber And he hits it first time with his right foot on the volley but he just snatches at it a little bit Not relaxed and just kind of shakes the ball into the ground wider than near post And I would imagine Chalannoglu as well, he will be wanted for that match here against Napoli But surprisingly lost to Atalanta on Sunday afternoon They haven't had to do a lot to be won the lock in this game in Terefe It's been a real grindy performance hasn't it? It's not been pretty at all as Martin Elliott has now just tumbled over Free kick to Arsenal on the half way lane They're doing everything they can to slow the game down, break it up Take ages bringing the ball back When they go on the floor they're now 5-10 seconds laying on the floor if there's a foul If they're able to get a point, if they're able to find something, get the goal, get the equaliser and get a point This would be an excellent result in these circumstances against these opponents Do you know what it would show? Real mental resilience if Arsenal were to come out of this with a point If they had to get a goal and go home 1-1 it would be a brilliant showing from this team at the moment They've won a corner Martin Elliott's won another corner off Dumfries And they've had a little word and it's Trossard who's going to take it from the far side Just wonder whether it's worth fairing it, it's the same routine again for Arsenal And actually that might be what they're doing here Saliba is chatting at the back post with party and with white and with Haberts And here is the Trossard corner then Driven into the near post, attempted flick Off Haberts who made the run there but it came off the Arsenal man straight behind Whatever it was they were trying, it didn't work, well kick into The delivery was all wrong, Trossard doesn't get enough height on the ball Haberts coming to the near post for a flick on and the delivery was poor And now they're taking an eternity to take this goal kick Of course they are, more commentary tomorrow night by the way England squad announcement tomorrow afternoon 2 o'clock, we'll have that 4-1-5 live Both England matches, Greece, Republic of Ireland, 5-5 the place to listen to them tomorrow night Manchester United, Pauk, but all of the matches Involving the British and the Irish clubs you'll hear Then covered tomorrow night and then lots more Premier League commentary Saturday and Sunday As we'll continue to be the case for the next 4 seasons after this As well after the Premier League right steal was sorted out this week Here come Arsenal, down the left hand side Martin Ely with Timber, back to Timber and the Dutchman works it all the way across But Bissek was there coming across the left side of the central defensive position To pass it out for a throw Great play from Timber, really energetic down the left and Bissek, he reads it so well Comes across, releases himself and deals with it Ball driven in, all that like, Haberts with a chance, shoots it's deflected off Bissek wide Well the inter defender did exceptionally well there but that was a big chance for Haberts Great control actually, shot on the turn but Bissek was in the right place at the right time Well that's the moment isn't it, drops to Haberts He's got a little bit of time to get a good strike off with his left foot He doesn't hit it particularly cleanly and like you said that is some block Bissek throws himself in front of it, puts his left leg up and the ball just deflects off him out for a corner Inter have not had a corner, Arsenal had 7 in the first half, this is their 6th of the second period, Saka waits to take this And there's a false start, back he goes again Saka, just off the pitch and now takes it in, teasingly to the near post where it's headed down He's looking for the party at the near post but it's headed by Inter back to Saka Still in the full back position, Trossard puts his foot on the ball, Trossard then flicks it to Saka It just gets there with his left foot into the area, it's headed away, safely for Inter who then win a free kick, fouled by Saliba and Terremen And the full time whistle has gone at the den, have they won 1-0 again? Are they involved? They have, Millwall 1 leads, they have a vintage Millwall display hands, they have a 4 straight 1-0 win The game's only goal, a quality finish from defender Jaffet Tanganga Millwall move into 5th and status quo booms around this concrete jungle, Millwall 1 leads 0 And leads, leads losing for the first time in 9 matches A stoke on now 2-0 up that he would park against Blackburn And Tom Cannon has scored his 7th goal of the season as the ball has played forward for Inter Arsenal have it back party to the right hand side and Brest winning 2-0 at Sparta Prague Now as their Champions League adventure continues, the French side, he has White, White back to Saliba Time running out for Arsenal, into the last 15 minutes now Matt, comes back to Saliba Who will go all the way over there to the left hand side where Timber gets the ball under control Looks for Martin Ely, whose heels are almost on the white line up against Dumfries again Then back to Timber just outside the penalty area, works it back to Martin Ely Lots of Arsenal shirts inside the area, Martin Ely trying to find one of them In comes the cross, that's headed away at the back post by Damian And then Damian is in position again to clear it away to the half way line, hooked 4 Arsenal, it's all Arsenal possession now inside the Inter half It's the Italian champions who have the lead, the side that has won 7 of their last 8 matches Lost only once this season in all competitions and that was here in the Milan Derby Throwing 4 White, half way inside the Inter half I mean they're not battering at the door, but they are tapping away at it Yeah, no, it's been real sustained controlled pressure hasn't it And you scratch your head to think if Inter walk away with a win here I said a moment ago they've done very little to have to achieve that in terms of creating anything And in this second half, they've just been dominated in this second half by Arsenal But the back door has been very secure for Inter in the classic Italian side It was when they won the European Cup for the first time, won it twice In consecutive seasons in 1964 and 1965 when one of the greats of coaching Helene O'Harrera was in charge here, he came up with the idea of Cattonaccio The ultra defensive security style of play And this Inter side here are defending so well now in 2024 And they're going to make what is their final change in tap And the excellent Frederico DiMarco, the bleach, blonde head, wing back Has come on to replace Terrini, the man who won the penalty although I don't think you do a great deal about it That's quite generous to say that So he's off anyway to Reimi and DiMarco is off 1-0 to Inter, 1-0 to Simone Insargi's side Standing, watching with his arms crossed Brother of the great Filippo, who is, by the way Matt Filippo Insargi Is the coach of Pisa, who are top of Serie B So one brother, coaches the Italian champions, the other brother, top of the second division Here's Sacca, he was a good player wasn't he, just here's Trossard Trossard turning, giving it back to Sacca, certainly Arsenal have not given up hope here And have just seen Ethan 1Aery getting himself ready Now Gézous on the right, Gézous swings it into the back post to diving, Dumfries Is able to head that away then, Barela with a click, as Inter look to Cliem Turandol will turn it all the way back to Sommar, they're not going to over commit themselves Now it's another really good opportunity created by Arsenal, though, great crossing Short pass out by Sommar to Barela, and he's been dispossessed And now Arsenal might have a chance but devise in position to head it back towards the far side after the cross came in From Timbac, that was careless from Inter, but they've got away with it They didn't really, like I say, they're not committing forward at all They've just gone into, you know, they've been in protection mode almost all the whole of the second half to be honest But at the moment there's no one up the pitch at all, they're just clearing the ball, giving it back to Arsenal And sitting there in a big defensive unit, five across the back It's almost like two banks of five to be honest, the way they're setting up Yeah, and I mean, Terimi's gone off and DiMarco's come on, so he's another defender really Arsenal swinging in from the left hand side, Gézous with a challenge But De Vrij stretches for it, gets his foot to it, clears it to Saka It's going to be a double change for Arsenal, Zinchenko is going to come on as well Here's Saka, Saka left-footed ball in, this one's headed away by Bisec, only to Trossard Trossard then, with his back to the penalty area To Gabrielle, Martinelli on the stretch, in comes Dumfries to get a touch on that To knock it out of play for the throw-in, I think we will see the changes now Arsenal, who's got Chelsea on Sunday, you'll hear that on five live, Chelsea Arsenal on Sunday Manchester United Leicester as well, Saturday, Wolves, Southampton, the big match at three Brighton Manchester City at 5.30, all of those five live commentaries And England, Australia will be on Sports Extra from Twickenham Right, Trossard coming off, Zinchenko coming on And who's the other Arsenal player who came off? Looks like Timber So it's a straight swap, Zinchenko coming on for him And Weneri is going to come on, Ethan Weneri making his Champions League debut The 17-year-old here in this great place, Giuseppe Miata That's a memory to last a lifetime, particularly if he's able to play a part in Arsenal getting something And here he is, the number 53 in possession, the Londoner, Ethan Weneri Who has scored goals this season in the Carabao Cup But this, with all due respect, is now the biggest stage, let's say Comes back to Saliba, Saliba now here to Saka on the right Saka drifting in field, DiMarco comes across Still with his left foot, Bukajosaka now closer to the centre-circle With the clock now ticking into the 83rd minute here And Inter still leading through that Chalanole penalty, controversial award of penalty Just before half-time, Gabriel to Martinelli, Martinelli now Martinelli is closed down by Dumfries, in comes the cross for Arsenal Diavri is there, ahead of Havertz, headed for it again for Arsenal by Pate And the party groans from the home supporters in the stands here Inter are unable to keep possession There hasn't been much unrest from the home fans, even though there hasn't been much of a showing from Inter in this second half They're not even attempting to get up the pitch and create any chances, the crowd have been very patient Sincenco, they nearly arrive, Sincenco, he plays the ball into the penalty area Clear away on the edge of the box for Inter More goals in the Champions League, Feyenoord have got a call back against Salzburg What's happened here, two Rams, fouled by Saliva I don't even think it's a foul Feyenoord won Salzburg two now with that call back from Moussa and Bayern Munich are in the lead Against Ben Fika, Moussiala scoring for Bayern Munich, Matt Another foul, Tram going absolutely nowhere All he wants to do is win a foul, he's only out to win this foul He waits until Saliva gets close to him, there's a tiny bit of contact And he's down on the floor and the referee's steaming over, blowing his whistle and foul And it's been very much that game, the frustration How difficult this has been for Arsenal to manage They've done a pretty good job of it, I have to say so far, but it is quite annoying Certainly is, certainly is for Arsenal, Inter, one nil up Bayern, a bigger part in Red Star Belgrade, two Barcelona, five is now the latest score there It has finished Coventry one, Derby two, and also Blackburn nil, Stoke two Those are final scores in the 745s, still Luton one, Cardiff nil and Preston nil, Sunderland nil Arsenal trying to break down in time, Zinchenko But now just over five minutes to play here and the home crowd, this fervent set of inter-supporters In the steeply banked stands, are trying to see their team through here Party for Arsenal, party goes on a little wander, then gives it square to Gabrielle Zinchenko available to the left-hand side, Zinchenko turns, passes it to the feet of Martin Ely Martin Ely passes it beyond Dumfries, Zinchenko on the chase, that it is Aslani who puts in the challenge And the ball bounces out of play off the Arsenal man in the end for a throw into Inter Down in their own right back area, and all of the Inter players that offend us Applaud the effort of Dumfries to win that throw in for his team He didn't quite get the space, Zinchenko to get the cross and he was trying to manoeuvre it over on that far side But there was no opening for him to cross the ball and he had to turn out in the end And then Dumfries is in the pole position because he's showing him towards the corner flag And then he wins the throw in as well Throw in taken by Inter, Arsenal have got them pinned back in there though When Airy jumps for the ball, just outside the D, Arsenal supporters getting a message Telling them they'll have to wait inside the stadium here at the end of the match And it is turning cold, when Airy, now to Zinchenko, Zinchenko to Martin Ely Right footed cross, but there in the middle, Pavard is there to jump high and head it back out towards the far side They've headed everything out of the box, you have to say the three centre backs are very measured They never split too far open, they're so close to each other, they defend the heart of that 18-yard box, brilliantly Arsenal coming again, Havertz on the right-hand side, Atalanta now 2-0 up at Stuttgart Here's Saka, the camera lights, the phone lights have gone on in the ground Saka clips the ball across, took a deflection, bounces down Havertz with a shot on the turn but the whistle had already gone for the foul, near the penalty spot Free kick for Inter, more frustration for Arsenal after the Havertz challenge on Aslani I'm not sure he gaped the foul actually, I think he waved him up, John, he ran over to him and just waved him up He's given a goal kick for the shot from Havertz that went wide I think you're right, he gave a goal kick Which is strange because he's been giving free kicks for challenges like that all night, but he didn't give that one So, five lies from the BBC, live here in Milan on what looks like it could be another setback for Arsenal here It's their first defeat in the Champions League this season, but it's not over yet Two and a half minutes of the 90 to play and they certainly haven't given this up White then feel towards one area, then back towards the halfway line in the centre circle Parting, rolls the pass out towards Zincenco, comes back in towards the tall Gabrielle All of the corners that Arsenal have had, seven in the first half, six in the second, the Dumfries clearance off the line But I mean it's been defended, superbly, and it's like being off the training ground, isn't it? Here's Zincenco, out to Martinelli on the left hand side, Dumfries is there and Pirella, Zincenco swings it in It's half headed out to the edge of the area, Gabrielle shoots on the turn, it's straight into Bisse Who celebrates his own block again You generally feel like the crowd really do celebrate that kind of resilience as well, don't they? They enjoy it, the feeling that you're under siege and you're defending for your life Like I said, it's in the DNA, I'm going to use that phrase of this club going all the way back to those days in the 60s that I was talking about Here's Saka on the right hand side, for Arsenal, trying to weave his way past Damián who just got a foot in on that Comes back to Saliba though, Saliba, he has the cross all the way right there, bounces across for Martinelli Martinelli, he's got Birella closest to Martinelli, he's balling, Havertz for the header Bounces down on the edge of the six yard box, but yet again there's someone there, it was Pavard this time He was able to scoop it away with his right foot, then in, left footed by Saka to the back post, that one There's also Havertz away, again it was Pavard who was there, again it comes back to Saka on the right hand side And then one area with a turn, one area he's got interplayers all around him, however he was able to keep it, helped out by Pártí Then Saliba, his cross in, Birella is there, jumping at the ball and hooking it away, then Turan goes down, doesn't get the free kick This time, Arsenal are still able to attack, Saka with White on the right, Saka's low ball in, Bisec has half cleared it De Marcos got it further away to the half way line, wave after wave now for Arsenal, you know there is urgency now And intensity, because they have to, because we are now in the 90th minute and Inter are leading 1-0 And Zincenko with a high pass to the back post, Havertz jumps for it, but Bisec was there as well And the referee calls the medical people on, because there's been a clash of heads between Havertz and Bisec and they're both lying on the ground Yeah, that was a hefty collision, Bisec does very well and the players are really waving the medical teams on I wouldn't be surprised if there's a real bump to the forehead of Kai Havertz as Bisec flicks his head back to flick and head of the ball away Havertz is coming onto the back of him and they just clash heads, but I mean how many deliveries have Arsenal put into the box And if you can count up all the crosses, De Vrij and Pavard have just got their big toe on everything that's dropped in that 6 yard box And just managed to flick it away every time, it's been that kind of defending all night I should say as well, you know with a clash of heads here, it's quite a nasty clash of heads for Havertz This could be an issue for him for Chelsea on Sunday It's got potential, I mean I think it looks more like a tissue injury as opposed to just kind of split his forehead I don't think it was too heavily concussed, but it'll probably have a bit of a bump and it looks like he's got a split on the top of his forehead There's blood pouring down his face, as Matt says, as a totalist, as in the first half you're very good on your medical issues And it is a cut probably right on the forehead line, so we'll have a lengthy stoppage here We're well beyond the 90 minutes now, and Martin Odegaard is going to come on and make his return And David Ryder is there on the halfway line to welcome him back So we've got a stoppage here, which means that we can get the latest on Preston Sunderland from Sani Radra Vagela Well the referee has just blown his whistle, Preston Nyl, Sunderland Nyl, the leaders remain top, but are held by a bright north-end side Villaloni, Kane, Kessler Hayden had a huge chance, just 90 seconds in, but put it wide Now I called it tenuous pre-match, but north-end are now 22 midweek games on beaten at home, you'll never sing that Preston Nyl, Sunderland Nyl And that's a second consecutive Nyl-Nyl draw for Sunderland, the leaders It is still Luton 1, Cardiff Nyl are still playing there And what is the latest on the one-day international, Daniel Norcross? Well, it's just finished the England, and he's 263 for eight unbelievable riches 25 runs came from the last over, thanks to the bat of Joffre Archu, finished on 38 from just 17 balls with three sixes in there It's a target they could only have dreamt of when they were 24 for four It's one that they could defend on an awkward pitch, 264 the West Indies are going to need if they're going to clinch this series decider And here in Milan, Martin Odegaard returns to action for Arsenal With two minutes of added time played, he's been given the captain's armband as he ran on by Bukai Osaka Martin Odegaard has missed the last 12 matches, and what a great sight it is to see him coming on However, not such a good sight to see Kai Havets, who's walking round the side of the pitch with a bandage being held to his head I think the cut did look like it was more in his hairline, as opposed to around his forehead So, just thinking header in the ball, thinking of Sunday, making sure that he plays It may not be quite as bad an issue, but we'll have to wait and see We've got five minutes of added time, and there might be more to add on after that, I don't know Because of that injury to Havets, Atletico Madrid have beaten PSG a late goal by Correa So Paris Saint-Germain won, Atletico Madrid 2, also Sparta-Frog 1, Brest 2 as a final score Another win in the Champions League for Brest, Arsenal here facing their first defeat, 1-0 down As Damian has had all the clearance from deep inside his own half, two round his challenge in Saliba There was a hesitation there from Saliba, who's actually recovered very well there Conceded a throw-in though, where, in Zaghi, just allowed the ball to bounce past him as you would, of course, if anyone would Yeah, you could tell that in his mind he was very tempted to just snatch it at that moment, but backed off into his technical area Unlike Nicolateta, 9 minutes ago Pick the ball off the field, in the second half, and was booked for it Throw-in for Inter, who were nearly there, into the fine victory this for Inter in the Champions League this season After their 0-0 draw against Manchester City, they're going to have played Manchester City and Arsenal and not conceded a goal That's not bad going Very impressive Very impressive from Simonian Zaghi's side, who have also beaten Red Star, Belgrade, 4-0 and Young Boys 1-0 It's not 5-star viewing though, John No, it's not There's always a compromise It's been gritty, it's been ugly, but it's winning football And Arsenal passing it out from the back And Zintenko back to Raya, this might be the last attack, 5 minutes have been added There'll be controversy over the awarding of the penalty, I'm sure, from Nicolateta Arsenal felt that they had a case themselves, Marina, who conceded the penalty When the goalkeeper, Summer, came out and punched the ball, but made contact with his head But Arsenal now, this may well be the last attack Saka, Saka, Damian so close to him, party Then back to Rice, to White, a bigger part One area, lovely turn, and the shot left footed from just outside the area Flies away over the angle of post and par, superb play from the T-Naser He's got some talent this boy, he is a player The way he received that ball, he's got a lovely shift of body weight He throws the defender, takes it on his back foot and then just somehow Managed to roll out the situation, and on his left foot they are really fancied him to hit the target That felt like there was going to be a big moment happened for his Champions League debut at the San Siro He just snatched at the shot a little bit and hit it way too high Goal kick, still the final whistle does not come from the Romanian referee So there might be one final chance for Arsenal, if they can get this forward But Saka is barged over by DeMarco, that's a free kick, Damian's flop to the floor Simone and Zaghi is about 25 yards out of his coaching area, and he's getting yellow guarded for that So now both managers have been booked in the game And it's a free kick, I think one last set piece now for Arsenal This is it, this is the final fling White plays it to Saka down the right, left footed cross into the back post But it's all about Pavard, and it's beyond Gabrielle, it's a goal kick And I think everyone here in black and blue inside San Siro knows that's it That's the last play of the match And the detail of marking players arriving in the box, or when it's locking in, using your body Being alive to any knockdowns, I mean, they've done it all in that 18-yard box tonight Luton have beaten Cardiff 1-0 in the championship And here in Milan, the goal kick is taken by Summer Who's on track for yet another clean sheet It's the first time Inter have kept four consecutive clean sheets in this competition Arsenal take the throw, we're now in the eighth minute of added time And still there might be a chance for Arsenal Long and forward from Saliba, bounces down for Jesus Into the area with a run on his right foot, shoots going to the defender, bounces out in Chenkou He was beaten to it by Borralla, and that is the last action of the match What a win for Inter, pretty It was not pretty, but Inter have won it And it's another setback for Arsenal, having lost at Newcastle on Saturday Now on this Wednesday night here in northern Italy, their first defeat in this Champions League group 1-0 Inter have won it, Matthew Upson The result is a big, big setback for Arsenal But I tell you what John, I thought the performance was anything but I thought it was a very good performance from Arsenal in terms of how they handled the game, the chances created There's going to be criticism about the fact that they're not getting enough goals Players are not finding that final touch And that is a big problem for Arsenal at the moment But the way they went about the game, there's nothing wrong with the group of players Their mentality, the way they fight in, they're being composed I think there's some real positives to take out of the performance It just didn't have the result and the goals, which I know is crucial That's the whole point, but it's not falling apart, shall we say I think the performance had a bit of backbone and spirit to it This was a tough, tough ask to come here tonight And as we're saying, it says it all that this Inter team, they're the Italian champions They won the League last season by a mile They've got a superb squad and they are very, very well coached And it says it all that they've played Manchester City and Arsenal this season And not conceded the goal It's a defensive masterclass, isn't it? They're not giving the home fans much to get off the seat about There's moments that they have, but to be honest, the way they defended the box Second balls, headers, using your body It was top, top stuff in the three-cent amount Right, so that's it Inter have beaten Arsenal by one goal to nearly here The penalty from Cialanollo just before half-time After 10 o'clock tonight, remember you can watch the highlights Of all of these midweek Champions League matches That's on the iPlayer Match of the day is on with Mark Chapman and Theo Walcott and Stephen Warnick That is on BBC One after the extended news that is about to come up More commentary tomorrow night from the Europa League Manchester United's match against Pauk Will be on the air tomorrow night We'll continue to update you on the One Day International In the West Indies where England have set the West Indies 264 To win the decider, you'll continue to hear updates on that Throughout the course of Gordon Smart's programme Gordon's coming up in a moment We will be recording for the five-life football daily Over the course of the next half hour So you'll be able to hear all of the fallout from tonight's matches But it is time now for Gordon to take it away with plenty to talk about",
