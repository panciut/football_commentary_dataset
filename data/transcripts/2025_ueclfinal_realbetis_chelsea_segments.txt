[0.00 - 7.20] P:1641.17 E:0.065778 |  of the UEFA Conference League winners so far, Roma in 2022, West Ham famously in Prague.
[7.20 - 11.40] P:1669.58 E:0.095650 |  We were there for that in 2023 and Olympiakos in 2024.
[11.40 - 18.84] P:1772.26 E:0.091552 |  Tonight Chelsea could become the first club in men's football to win all four of UEFA's
[18.84 - 21.72] P:1661.69 E:0.089697 |  major knockout competitions.
[21.72 - 25.12] P:1851.36 E:0.100377 |  The Betis fans have those green and white scarves held high.
[25.12 - 31.12] P:1784.92 E:0.091490 |  The Chelsea players all in blue, white socks pulled high, break away from the team huddle
[31.12 - 35.64] P:1803.78 E:0.087670 |  and this is the Chelsea team for tonight named by Enzo Moresca.
[35.64 - 41.00] P:1830.61 E:0.104444 |  Philip Jorgensen the dain in goal all in black, away to our right at Ports, the Chelsea fans
[41.00 - 42.00] P:1670.61 E:0.084437 |  behind him.
[42.00 - 46.88] P:1671.50 E:0.099504 |  Malogusto is in at right back, Rhys James is named amongst the substitutes, Mark Cucarera
[46.88 - 52.40] P:1704.23 E:0.096116 |  at left back, Trevor Chalabar and Benoit Badiasil the two sender backs.
[52.40 - 57.40] P:1861.24 E:0.099545 |  Cole Palmer relish in the occasion with the ball at his feet on the centre spot.
[57.40 - 62.92] P:1637.46 E:0.106923 |  Four or five keep the ups, picks it up and then places it down very precisely right in
[62.92 - 63.92] P:1682.05 E:0.111844 |  the middle of the pitch.
[63.92 - 69.76] P:1731.71 E:0.105029 |  Captain Enzo Fernandez alongside Moises Caesado in central midfield, Noni Madaway, K.A.
[69.76 - 74.64] P:1641.17 E:0.103200 |  Pedro Neto on the flanks and Cole Palmer in behind Nicholas Jackson.
[74.64 - 80.12] P:1578.64 E:0.106609 |  We are underway, five live BBC sounds and a very warm welcome to all our listeners on
[80.24 - 82.92] P:1733.17 E:0.117642 |  BBC Radio London this evening as well.
[82.92 - 87.40] P:1660.63 E:0.102077 |  Early challenge from Chalabar just outside the Chelsea penalty area and an important
[87.40 - 91.96] P:1626.75 E:0.100615 |  one as well on Abday who was trying to race onto a through ball there.
[91.96 - 93.60] P:1690.75 E:0.093409 |  Chalabar made the sliding tackle.
[93.60 - 98.12] P:1535.81 E:0.102353 |  I think Abday as he ran past him caught him with one of his boots in the head.
[98.12 - 103.36] P:1573.94 E:0.107894 |  Yeah, it's a fantastic challenge by Trevor Chalabay, full stretch, slides down is actually
[103.36 - 107.24] P:1356.89 E:0.108359 |  his knee that collides with Trevor Chalabar in his face.
[107.36 - 109.84] P:1548.48 E:0.108010 |  It seems to be OK, but it was a pretty big hit.
[111.04 - 115.12] P:1595.08 E:0.106660 |  Mark Schwartzer having played in two major European finals as we've been discussing
[115.12 - 118.84] P:1602.03 E:0.109272 |  Middlesbrough 2006, Fulham in 2010.
[118.84 - 122.72] P:1673.74 E:0.094918 |  Both of those against Spanish opposition in the stadium with us tonight.
[122.72 - 125.84] P:1669.37 E:0.100427 |  Pedro Neto scurrying away down the right just ran out of space.
[125.84 - 129.04] P:1714.81 E:0.102626 |  The ball has gone out for an early throw to rail.
[129.04 - 134.36] P:1724.53 E:0.107484 |  Betters they are defending the goal away to our left hand side and it is their very experienced
[134.48 - 139.08] P:1860.42 E:0.092565 |  centre back, Mark Bartra, who passes the ball to his right to Yusuf Sabali.
[139.08 - 142.20] P:1546.05 E:0.110601 |  Back here to Natan, the Brazilian online from Napoli.
[142.20 - 144.48] P:1713.01 E:0.106952 |  Goalkeeper under pressure from Nicholas Jackson.
[144.48 - 149.16] P:1578.21 E:0.104222 |  Jackson barges into Adrian and down he goes and the referee decides to give that as a
[149.16 - 150.16] P:1433.66 E:0.087733 |  free kick.
[150.16 - 153.60] P:1541.85 E:0.110095 |  But an early moment there for the former West Ham and Liverpool.
[153.60 - 157.88] P:1768.14 E:0.096651 |  Goalkeeper, Adrian, all in yellow, starting for Real Betters tonight.
[157.88 - 163.16] P:1619.42 E:0.104779 |  So Adrian in goal, Sabali, Bartra, Natan and Ricardo Rodriguez there back four.
[163.16 - 169.00] P:1542.61 E:0.106575 |  Pablo Fournals, Johnny Cardoso, the American international and Isco as a midfield three.
[169.00 - 174.00] P:1470.66 E:0.105107 |  The danger from the Flanks comes from Antony yet to touch the ball in the final and Abdei
[174.00 - 181.56] P:1399.08 E:0.114613 |  and Cedric Bacambu, international footballer for the Democratic Republic of Congo.
[181.56 - 186.16] P:1693.07 E:0.097847 |  Much-travelled footballer as well, starting as the centre forward for Real Betters who
[186.16 - 190.60] P:1618.94 E:0.093354 |  are now in control of the ball inside their own half, back into their own penalty area
[190.60 - 191.60] P:1798.42 E:0.106469 |  to Adrian.
[191.60 - 193.56] P:1718.92 E:0.101728 |  Side put to pass here to Bartra.
[193.56 - 197.16] P:1860.80 E:0.102641 |  Jackson again in very quickly for Chelsea, makes the tackle and actually Chelsea get
[197.16 - 198.16] P:1562.01 E:0.099930 |  the throw.
[198.16 - 201.24] P:1629.26 E:0.108959 |  Yeah, I tell you what, the bitters have been very, very slow playing the ball around the
[201.24 - 202.24] P:1424.07 E:0.099808 |  back.
[202.24 - 204.24] P:1439.68 E:0.109639 |  Adrian in particular has really taken his time.
[204.24 - 207.20] P:1362.48 E:0.100010 |  He got away with the one with Jackson's thumb begins.
[207.20 - 212.32] P:1742.80 E:0.101744 |  Yeah, probably was just a foul but he held the ball for such a long period of time, almost
[212.32 - 217.44] P:1920.33 E:0.110260 |  got caught out and just now again, he's touched and then delivery or pass was so slow and
[217.44 - 218.44] P:2077.84 E:0.101375 |  actually short.
[218.80 - 220.64] P:1902.51 E:0.102003 |  Chelsea playing left to right in the first half.
[220.64 - 224.88] P:1709.88 E:0.101912 |  Enzo Fernandez tackled through ball looking for Bacambu, goes past him, he won't get to
[224.88 - 225.88] P:1670.94 E:0.100984 |  that in time.
[225.88 - 228.92] P:1744.09 E:0.114855 |  Philip Jorgensen out to the edge of his penalty area.
[228.92 - 239.96] P:1794.91 E:0.106576 |  The Chelsea goalkeeper who has started 13 of the 14 games in the competition so far,
[239.96 - 247.68] P:1707.92 E:0.107548 |  so make that 14 out of 15, 23 years old, first season at the club having joined from Villareal.
[248.04 - 252.64] P:1985.53 E:0.107542 |  He passes the ball out here and then Gusto nearly loses it on the edge of the penalty
[252.64 - 253.64] P:2153.53 E:0.111632 |  area.
[253.64 - 257.08] P:2183.55 E:0.109109 |  A couple of loose touches back to Jorgensen, then you get the cheers and the whistles and
[257.08 - 260.20] P:1973.85 E:0.109812 |  the bet his fans float to pass out to the right hand side.
[260.20 - 265.24] P:1483.17 E:0.109435 |  Chalabar tries to play it forward, he's barged over and this time our referee who's from
[265.24 - 272.60] P:1555.80 E:0.115228 |  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Irfan Pelto, refereeing his first European final, 40 years old, took
[272.60 - 278.68] P:1760.08 E:0.106649 |  charge of Arsenal against Real Madrid earlier this season in the Champions League quarter
[278.68 - 279.68] P:1685.71 E:0.118168 |  finals.
[279.68 - 284.08] P:1733.97 E:0.105716 |  So got a close up view of those two brilliant free kicks from Declan Rice, he's in charge
[284.08 - 289.80] P:1832.61 E:0.095619 |  tonight, Chelsea have taken their free kick and Chalabar plays it back here to Jorgensen
[289.80 - 290.80] P:2097.07 E:0.111613 |  again.
[290.80 - 295.72] P:2306.96 E:0.110579 |  So no great drama in the first four minutes of the game, five live BBC sounds of BBC Radio
[295.72 - 299.52] P:1695.01 E:0.117210 |  London tonight to the UEFA Conference League final.
[299.52 - 303.64] P:1659.46 E:0.109209 |  Madiwaki first touch, clever one with his head, and what's it back to Fernandez inside
[303.64 - 304.64] P:1837.14 E:0.122569 |  the Chelsea half.
[304.64 - 309.08] P:1880.15 E:0.110156 |  Caisseto went to be quick to cover the ground there, controls the ball well, plays back
[309.08 - 310.92] P:1640.58 E:0.127883 |  to Chalabar and across it comes the netto.
[310.92 - 315.16] P:1596.18 E:0.123152 |  I don't think Col Parma's had a touch yet, here he comes, moves close to netto, wide
[315.16 - 318.04] P:1603.13 E:0.119317 |  on the right for Chelsea, just inside the bet his half.
[318.04 - 322.64] P:1527.61 E:0.116481 |  A couple of touches just trying to draw the can move towards him, then he passes the ball
[322.64 - 327.68] P:1555.95 E:0.111556 |  away, badia shield forward to Gusto, Caisseto's first time ball, flick from Jackson looking
[327.68 - 328.68] P:1647.48 E:0.096111 |  for Parma.
[328.84 - 332.64] P:1655.90 E:0.102374 |  And then he doesn't come off and suddenly Abdey is away down the left hand side for
[332.64 - 337.04] P:1629.61 E:0.109820 |  Betis, bit of space to work with, takes on Caisseto on the outside, down to the byline
[337.04 - 340.92] P:1683.34 E:0.102345 |  he goes, Caisseto makes a half block and the header from Anthony, his first touch of the
[340.92 - 345.28] P:1796.49 E:0.101939 |  game, can't control it, looks well up over the bar and goes behind for a goal kick to
[345.28 - 346.28] P:1911.16 E:0.095857 |  Chelsea.
[346.28 - 350.84] P:1768.58 E:0.097911 |  Yeah, Malagusta there took a big big gamble, he tries to win the ball before it gets to
[350.84 - 354.92] P:1676.47 E:0.101722 |  Abdey and he doesn't get there and Abdey just turns and runs into space, he's the one that
[354.92 - 358.68] P:1724.18 E:0.106275 |  runs on the left hand side, just outside the out, out in the out box to the byline,
[358.68 - 363.56] P:1698.40 E:0.100734 |  gets that cross in and Anthony's the one that springs very, very high, just can't control
[363.56 - 366.36] P:1486.79 E:0.101243 |  the header and it goes quite wide past the goal in the end.
[366.36 - 370.32] P:1962.93 E:0.111168 |  So danger averted from Chelsea, Malagusta just has to be careful not to get drawn out of
[370.32 - 371.80] P:2119.62 E:0.102343 |  position too easily.
[371.80 - 377.64] P:1891.78 E:0.120050 |  Real Betis, Niel, Chelsea, Niel, early stages of the final, ball played by Chalabar up towards
[377.64 - 383.64] P:1737.39 E:0.121710 |  netto, pressure on him but support from Parma, he goes striding away, ball at his feet down
[383.64 - 387.52] P:1919.68 E:0.110728 |  the right, cuts back in field onto his left foot, little trick, beats his man in the area,
[387.52 - 392.56] P:1757.48 E:0.100213 |  low shot towards the near post, Adrian's in the right position and he makes the block
[392.56 - 396.24] P:1789.18 E:0.105385 |  who they're talking about, the Chelsea owners whether they were in attendance for the final
[396.24 - 400.52] P:1838.83 E:0.103668 |  tonight here in Poland, Chelsea concede a free kick on the edge of the Betis penalty
[400.52 - 407.76] P:1709.67 E:0.100432 |  area, indeed they are, Todd Boli and Bidad Egbali, both here inside the stadium tonight,
[407.76 - 413.28] P:1579.26 E:0.102002 |  sat next to Alexander Ceperin and in terms of the T-Fo display from the Real Betis
[413.76 - 418.60] P:1648.86 E:0.098425 |  fans before the game, I was right, it wasn't meant to be Manuela Greeny, St Ferdinand is
[418.60 - 425.36] P:1630.48 E:0.093020 |  the patron saint of Seville, also known as San Fernando, that was the man we saw, big
[425.36 - 429.52] P:1733.98 E:0.095798 |  and bold away to our left, attacking from Betis, here's Isko, left foot across into
[429.52 - 433.08] P:1721.60 E:0.101309 |  the near post, Jorgensen does well, called for that and took it on the half volley at
[433.08 - 437.64] P:1831.19 E:0.102544 |  his near post, good vision as well, doles it out under onto his captain Enzo Fernandez,
[437.64 - 443.00] P:1936.61 E:0.090609 |  he comes striding forward and plays a pass to his left to Jackson, Jackson running with
[443.04 - 447.84] P:2021.56 E:0.094827 |  the ball at his feet, cuts in from the left wing, back to Fernandez, Betis standing off
[447.84 - 452.40] P:2139.56 E:0.101421 |  for the moment, Chelsea in a good attacking position, here's Maduaki, takes on Sabali,
[452.40 - 456.92] P:1912.07 E:0.095812 |  pokes the ball past him, Sabali slides in, still in play there, little nudge from Jackson
[456.92 - 460.68] P:1837.78 E:0.100316 |  as Barca tried to clear the referee's spot at that and he's given another free kick
[460.68 - 465.08] P:1853.36 E:0.093139 |  to Real Betis and I wonder where the mark, that's why Enzo Fernandez has come in there,
[465.08 - 469.64] P:1976.91 E:0.094452 |  three or four decisions, first five, six minutes of this game have gone against Chelsea in
[469.68 - 473.52] P:1846.98 E:0.092855 |  terms of those challenges, little nudges and barges in 50-50s.
[473.52 - 476.72] P:1615.93 E:0.104115 |  Yeah, Chelsea's been a little bit physical, but they've won the ball a couple of times,
[476.72 - 481.12] P:1580.38 E:0.096457 |  they've won some more Catares, he wins the ball and then there's a coming together and
[481.12 - 485.16] P:1499.37 E:0.090769 |  the referee goes against him, he gets the first touch and then that's why there's a
[485.16 - 488.96] P:1714.84 E:0.095881 |  bit of frustration, Enzo Fernandez there going to the referee, letting him know he's not
[488.96 - 493.96] P:1753.70 E:0.098588 |  happy so far with the way that the referee's given Betis a lot of the 50-50 calls at the
[493.96 - 494.96] P:1912.76 E:0.077411 |  moment.
[494.96 - 499.36] P:1689.64 E:0.112183 |  Paul is backward, Phillip Jorgensen, Chelsea's young goalkeeper, holds the ball,
[500.32 - 503.72] P:1842.07 E:0.108580 |  in his white glove on his right hand, drops it,
[505.24 - 510.00] P:1821.13 E:0.109308 |  throwing the white boots to match and then drills it low and left towards Madawayki,
[510.00 - 514.36] P:1745.03 E:0.099723 |  the ball comes skidding across the pitch, Madawayki controls, goes back to Kukereya,
[515.24 - 519.64] P:1704.11 E:0.095569 |  loose pass out from the back by Badia Shil, Fernandez has to try and win a couple of 50-50s,
[519.64 - 524.32] P:1765.29 E:0.101830 |  he does that, then another one, Fernandez on the ball for Chelsea, passes across here to
[524.44 - 529.28] P:1689.80 E:0.111140 |  Parma, he's chased by Abdey, quickly wicks the ball out to the right and Netto's got
[529.28 - 534.56] P:1857.90 E:0.109020 |  a chance to pick up pace and moving quickly in field, now surely no, not caught there,
[534.56 - 539.04] P:1699.67 E:0.102803 |  jumped over the challenge, in midfield from Cardoso, went down, no free kick given, his
[539.04 - 543.44] P:1616.21 E:0.107264 |  for Kanbu, backpedaling, trying to control the ball inside the Chelsea half, he's then
[543.44 - 546.00] P:1612.17 E:0.103187 |  tabled by Gusto and Chelsea could build again.
[546.00 - 551.00] P:1534.35 E:0.109697 |  Yeah, very strange decision for the referee there, Netto does so so well, darts inside
[551.04 - 555.88] P:1600.84 E:0.101792 |  as he drops the shoulder in, comes back inside the pitch and I'm sure he gets a touch on
[555.88 - 560.48] P:1338.30 E:0.107825 |  him, as he knocks the ball past the defender, the defender gets a timing roll, the referee's
[560.48 - 562.16] P:1485.70 E:0.108170 |  right there, he just doesn't give it.
[562.16 - 567.68] P:1625.10 E:0.099986 |  It's one of those, Mark, even if he wasn't caught he had to leap out of the way not
[567.68 - 571.20] P:1634.10 E:0.108313 |  to be caught there by Johnny Cardoso, he looked like there was contact, Chelsea have given
[571.20 - 576.20] P:1823.58 E:0.110128 |  the ball away, Isco clever pass into the penalty, Abdey shoots and finds the bottom corner,
[576.92 - 582.92] P:1781.11 E:0.110667 |  for Rael Betis in their first major European final, the substitutes can't control themselves,
[582.92 - 588.68] P:1732.92 E:0.117728 |  they're on the field and celebrating, but Chelsea show Betis space at the back and
[588.68 - 594.44] P:1703.13 E:0.122210 |  water finish from Abdey, fires it into the bottom corner and Chelsea behind, early on
[594.44 - 597.72] P:1861.90 E:0.126505 |  in Poland, Rael Betis won, Chelsea nil.
[597.72 - 603.48] P:1323.72 E:0.125343 |  Yeah, brutal, absolutely brutal, ruthless from Betis, Abdey's fantastic finish, takes
[603.56 - 607.92] P:1317.43 E:0.141447 |  a touch, touch and rifles it into that bottom right hand corner, gives the goalkeeper no
[607.92 - 611.88] P:1360.31 E:0.126835 |  chance whatsoever, and it all comes about because Chelsea, they're in good possession,
[611.88 - 616.36] P:1280.68 E:0.128407 |  they try and play as Gustav Mahler this time, he tries to play the ball from midfield, he's
[616.36 - 621.16] P:1123.50 E:0.136383 |  tight inside, tries to play it across the left hand side, gets easily cut out and there's
[621.16 - 626.28] P:1192.82 E:0.140952 |  a really good pass from Anthony across, drops the shoulder, plays across, Abdey takes it
[626.28 - 631.80] P:1155.61 E:0.134911 |  from his right onto his left and then rifles it across the goalkeeper into the bottom corner,
[631.80 - 632.80] P:1534.46 E:0.101502 |  brilliant finish.
[633.56 - 639.80] P:1609.75 E:0.112476 |  Genius from Isco with the pass as Mark suggests, Chelsea gave him the chance, he had the ball
[639.80 - 644.04] P:1475.32 E:0.108618 |  on the edge of the penalty area, whole sea of blue shirts around him, but at the corner
[644.04 - 650.36] P:1761.62 E:0.112482 |  of his left eye, he saw the run from Abdey, disguise on the pass, 90 degrees to his left
[650.36 - 655.32] P:1920.45 E:0.094367 |  hand side, Abdey took a touch and fits the finish, pass for Lydde-Yorgansson.
[655.32 - 659.32] P:1889.74 E:0.110875 |  That's the quality of Isco isn't it, he's got the ability, he sees everything in front of him,
[659.32 - 663.32] P:1772.88 E:0.097253 |  it's a pass that most people probably wouldn't have even seen, and he's got his head down,
[663.72 - 667.64] P:1878.80 E:0.101080 |  and he drops the shoulder, he just plays the ball straight to Abdey, Abdey takes a great
[667.64 - 671.80] P:1943.26 E:0.092046 |  touch and then the finish is equally good. Well Mark talks about it in the build up to the game,
[671.80 - 679.64] P:1637.25 E:0.087453 |  Spanish teams against English teams in European finals in men's football, they have won the last
[679.64 - 685.56] P:1704.25 E:0.093238 |  nine, the last English team to beat a Spanish team in a European final, Liverpool in the UEFA cup as
[685.56 - 690.76] P:1825.39 E:0.095338 |  was back in 2001 against Alves, Gusto is there, hacks the ball away with his left foot, he was
[690.76 - 695.56] P:1588.41 E:0.104491 |  at fault for that bet his goal, loose with possession inside the Chelsea half, Fernandez
[695.56 - 701.24] P:1681.02 E:0.102878 |  under pressure for Chelsea in front of his own penalty area, he's fouled, Cardoso steps in and
[701.24 - 707.88] P:1719.81 E:0.100349 |  sort of subtly kicks the ball away, Caesado didn't like it, shoves Cardoso and the referee steps in
[707.88 - 712.44] P:1696.86 E:0.104579 |  just to have a word with Moises Caesado. Yeah see I think that's poor referee, Chelsea trying to
[712.44 - 717.40] P:1807.50 E:0.097251 |  play a quick free kick, Cardoso comes across and he just toe pokes the ball away, he kicks the
[717.40 - 721.08] P:1771.00 E:0.103353 |  ball away, he's time wasting, the referee's right there, he's got to give me a little guard,
[721.08 - 724.76] P:1421.07 E:0.110113 |  instead he just has a word with him and obviously they slow the play down, Bidders are over the
[724.76 - 729.40] P:1528.69 E:0.107369 |  regroup, got players behind the ball and Chelsea have to take their time now. Well if Chelsea didn't
[729.40 - 734.12] P:1717.03 E:0.105083 |  know they were in for a game tonight in this final they certainly do now, Real Betis have bounced
[734.12 - 740.12] P:1709.79 E:0.108695 |  at the stadium away to our left, that's actually making me feel slightly queasy watching it bounce
[740.12 - 747.56] P:1679.70 E:0.111579 |  up and down, green and white everywhere, just a sea of arms, short sleeves, green and white shirts,
[747.56 - 753.48] P:1654.96 E:0.107710 |  everyone clapping above their heads and then those green and white flags, the big white cross
[754.28 - 759.88] P:1653.82 E:0.125525 |  in the middle of the green rectangle being waved furiously, Real Betis won, Chelsea 0, Col Palmer
[759.88 - 765.48] P:1934.98 E:0.120986 |  on the move for Chelsea with that long loping stride, feeds the pass to Netto, Palmer drops
[765.56 - 769.88] P:1784.62 E:0.104436 |  deep, Gustav makes a run beyond Netto, Netto can't find him when the ball goes away
[769.88 - 775.64] P:1691.94 E:0.097875 |  for a Real Betis goal kick, coming up to 12 minutes played in the first half here in Stadeon
[775.64 - 781.88] P:1662.86 E:0.103478 |  Grossois, Real Betis won, Chelsea near them, there we get our first close-up shot at the
[781.88 - 789.80] P:1504.86 E:0.116387 |  craggy face of Manuel Pellegrini, 71 years old, his team in front. Yeah I mean Chelsea just have to
[789.80 - 793.72] P:1528.04 E:0.111178 |  settle down a little bit, obviously they feel a bit in shock from conceding that goal,
[793.72 - 798.04] P:1525.07 E:0.106803 |  come against a run of play, it's their own mistake that leads to it. Could be another one here,
[798.04 - 802.12] P:1612.77 E:0.109242 |  Abdey's onto a loose ball inside the Chelsea half, Gustav is back to try and make the tackle,
[802.12 - 808.28] P:1305.62 E:0.129128 |  Abdey just about keeps his feet, turns, plays it to Isco, dark hair with the bid, cross comes in
[808.28 - 813.40] P:1707.50 E:0.114816 |  from Abdey on the left, bounces in front of Jorgensen and he gathers that cleanly at his near post.
[813.40 - 817.08] P:1659.12 E:0.118187 |  Yeah I think in the end it was good defending there, I think it's Trevor Chaloveo gets a
[817.08 - 821.64] P:1721.45 E:0.109082 |  bit of flexion, just deflects straight in the park for Jorgensen, you know Chelsea just too
[821.64 - 827.96] P:1644.73 E:0.113095 |  sloppy at times, giving away easy simple passes, balls have been intercepted into midfield, another
[827.96 - 833.56] P:1670.64 E:0.104466 |  one this time from Coseido, a silly straight, relatively straight ball in the midfield,
[833.56 - 836.76] P:1480.08 E:0.104808 |  so many betters players around, they're just waiting for it, they're straps everywhere.
[836.76 - 841.24] P:1743.49 E:0.117441 |  The cambo plays it to the edge of the box, a barter and Jorgensen's forced into a save,
[841.24 - 846.92] P:1728.65 E:0.111581 |  flying high to his right hand side, fabulous strike with the right foot, Chelsea very nearly,
[847.00 - 851.88] P:1687.08 E:0.115865 |  two nil down, that was the centre back striding forward, caught it sweetly, curling towards
[851.88 - 856.36] P:1684.67 E:0.099463 |  the top corner and Jorgensen does really well for Chelsea. Yeah it's a brilliant save from Jorgensen,
[856.36 - 861.00] P:1623.16 E:0.096810 |  I tell you what he almost gets caught out because it's a game, quick turnover possession,
[861.00 - 866.12] P:1660.12 E:0.103335 |  betters are really quick, really direct, ball played square to Bargeron, he just hits it first time.
[866.12 - 870.44] P:1733.74 E:0.101305 |  Corner taken short to Anthony on the edge of the penalty area, feeds it back here to Isco,
[870.44 - 875.56] P:1862.57 E:0.107484 |  chips it up in the air and the ball is ambitious from Savali with the left foot and it is well
[875.56 - 882.84] P:1744.55 E:0.114579 |  off target, Real Betis won, Chelsea nil, Chelsea goal kick, 14 minutes into the first half,
[882.84 - 887.88] P:1698.81 E:0.113077 |  bit of a storm threatening before the game, we had dark clouds above, we had a bit of light grain,
[888.76 - 893.48] P:1747.77 E:0.115403 |  into the rainbow in the sky as well, but no rain in the air right now, fairly mild night
[894.28 - 899.88] P:1610.64 E:0.129218 |  in south west Poland here and a great noise being made still by the fans of the Spanish
[899.88 - 904.44] P:1471.50 E:0.125681 |  team away to our left, they've left Colt Palmer in a bit of space, wide on the right inside the
[904.44 - 909.56] P:1411.55 E:0.127254 |  Chelsea half, he's in the bright orange boots this evening, not played too much conference league
[909.56 - 915.96] P:1531.39 E:0.126900 |  football for Chelsea this season, but here he is in the final, ball is played forward now to Jackson,
[915.96 - 921.16] P:1954.81 E:0.119866 |  Chelsea have options here, Jackson goes to his left to Madiwake, Madiwake dribbles into the penalty
[921.16 - 926.84] P:1765.10 E:0.121705 |  area, past Bartra, runs into another challenge knocked over, then Quesado, gathers the loose ball,
[926.84 - 931.48] P:1566.48 E:0.122832 |  hits the shot, that is blocked, Isco picks it up on the turn, Paddy Ashiling quickly with the
[931.48 - 936.12] P:1763.89 E:0.110623 |  challenge, tries to win it again and once again Chelsea penalised for a foul, that's going to be
[936.12 - 940.28] P:1688.75 E:0.104911 |  a real better free kick. Yeah, he gives a hand ball on this occasion, I mean his better shills
[940.28 - 944.36] P:1684.08 E:0.096096 |  challenge is actually a really good one against Isco, he does really well as he gets up, I think
[944.36 - 948.28] P:1598.47 E:0.093527 |  the ball, yeah that's right, the ball gets hit, I mean I don't think that's a hand ball, his hand
[948.28 - 952.84] P:1655.32 E:0.094970 |  is right next to him, he's getting up off the ground and the ball gets smashed at him from
[952.84 - 956.92] P:1629.26 E:0.099061 |  about five yards out, the referee is really quick to give Bedneson another free kick.
[956.92 - 965.00] P:1651.88 E:0.098969 |  Eighth European final for Chelsea in the knockout competitions, they've won six out of seven, fabulous
[965.00 - 970.36] P:1486.95 E:0.112122 |  record they have in the European finals, the only defeat against Manchester United in that
[970.36 - 976.76] P:1345.52 E:0.123502 |  Champions League final in Moscow back in 2008, they're behind tonight though, Bednes in the green
[976.76 - 981.88] P:1695.30 E:0.099357 |  and white stripes, green numbers on the back, play back to their goalkeeper, Adrienne, left
[981.88 - 987.64] P:1547.02 E:0.110986 |  footing pass from him out to Bartra, Bartra to Sibali, Sibali plays into the big field to four
[987.64 - 992.84] P:1764.90 E:0.103533 |  now, he threads one through, Bacambu tries an ambitious back heel, first time ball intercepted,
[992.84 - 998.20] P:1861.02 E:0.121073 |  Chelsea get it forward quickly to Madiouake, in field then to Qaisado, little bit of skill from
[998.20 - 1003.08] P:1874.44 E:0.129431 |  Fernandez, closed down by Isco, Qaisado's there in support, outside of his right foot, not enough on
[1003.08 - 1008.28] P:1670.21 E:0.107164 |  that, showed too much of it to Sibali who got there ahead of Madiouake, Betis had given the ball
[1008.28 - 1014.20] P:1453.40 E:0.121486 |  away, Madiouake is tackled again, lovely feet from Isco in a tight space, crosses the halfway
[1014.20 - 1020.44] P:1618.54 E:0.112952 |  line, again disguise on the pass into Cardoso and Betis moving quickly to the left hand side, so
[1020.44 - 1025.00] P:1358.47 E:0.127545 |  Abdei the goal scorer, he's been the bigger threat on the left hand side, Antoni's not really been
[1025.00 - 1030.04] P:1522.27 E:0.119098 |  involved in the game so far, he's hanging out wide right, Betis play the ball back to their own
[1030.04 - 1035.48] P:1479.91 E:0.109381 |  hand. Yeah all the attack for Bednes has been on the left hand side and it's really been difficult
[1035.72 - 1040.04] P:1426.42 E:0.108943 |  for Chelsea at the moment, mostly because of their own mistakes, I mean Mala Gusto obviously was the
[1040.04 - 1044.28] P:1524.94 E:0.099224 |  one that was a mistake for him that led to the goal in the first place and there's been a couple
[1044.28 - 1050.04] P:1832.70 E:0.106774 |  of stray passes, Chelsea just need to settle down a little bit, trying to rush things. Jackson trying
[1050.04 - 1055.88] P:1847.77 E:0.100396 |  to get away from Batra, this time Real Betis disappointed with a refereeing decision, Batra
[1056.60 - 1060.92] P:1892.81 E:0.090528 |  in on Jackson, Jackson just too quick for him on the turn, Batra's claiming he got a little
[1060.92 - 1065.08] P:1884.42 E:0.103521 |  toe on the ball there, caught Jackson as well, free kick for Chelsea. I think he may have,
[1065.08 - 1069.08] P:1762.65 E:0.120318 |  I think he may have got a touch on the ball again and for him unlucky and unfortunate for
[1069.08 - 1074.68] P:1634.02 E:0.116177 |  Betis that goes against him. You'll hear more from Pat Nevin on the show tonight, all the reaction
[1074.68 - 1079.88] P:1697.53 E:0.110017 |  as well, two tonight's football and the football daily podcast on the BBC Sounds app tomorrow,
[1080.68 - 1085.88] P:1596.52 E:0.114539 |  Chelsea trailing 1-0, nice pass from Cole Palmer down the inside left channel for Jackson,
[1085.88 - 1091.00] P:1771.14 E:0.118707 |  collect, turns, plays it back to Gusto, edge of the Betis area, forward to Neto back to Palmer,
[1091.24 - 1097.40] P:1938.79 E:0.122768 |  has to scurry back to collect possession again for Chelsea, 40 yards out, goes with a square ball
[1097.40 - 1102.84] P:1792.50 E:0.128202 |  across to Kukere, Betis have everyone behind the ball and here's Palmer again, 10 yards inside
[1102.84 - 1108.84] P:1770.64 E:0.120953 |  the Betis half, sees Neto in a bit of space on the right, chance to bring the ball forward to the
[1108.84 - 1113.88] P:1953.84 E:0.133457 |  edge of the penalty area, there's Palmer back to Neto again, thinks about a cross with the left
[1113.88 - 1118.76] P:1854.88 E:0.125198 |  foot, Palmer noses off side there, runs back into an onside position, then makes a dart down the
[1118.76 - 1123.96] P:1601.19 E:0.123777 |  right, glides past Rodriguez into the penalty area, challenged by Abdei, tries to get it back to
[1123.96 - 1128.76] P:1520.82 E:0.135952 |  Neto, Neto does well to win the ball and a hefty challenge there but he's got to turn away from
[1128.76 - 1134.36] P:1847.65 E:0.122480 |  goal over on that right hand touch line and Chelsea recycle with Gusto across to Quesado,
[1134.36 - 1140.12] P:1870.20 E:0.113590 |  central position now, 35 yards from goal, scoop past the Neto, leaps in the air athletically,
[1140.12 - 1144.68] P:1864.19 E:0.110241 |  brings it down on his chest, Betis fans over there felt the ball had gone out of play, the assistant
[1144.76 - 1151.24] P:1846.39 E:0.113830 |  referee was right there, didn't raise the flag, his baddest shield, his chip pass, spins in the air,
[1151.88 - 1156.68] P:2046.69 E:0.126143 |  pulls at the feet of Madaway King, Fernandez makes a little run down the left, he plays back to
[1156.68 - 1163.00] P:1948.97 E:0.122699 |  Kukere, air swaying as always, he runs with the ball, cross it comes to Chalabar, now to Gusto,
[1163.72 - 1169.48] P:1525.65 E:0.126666 |  got a Chelsea possession here, wide again to Neto, Neto looking for the option to Palmer,
[1169.48 - 1173.48] P:1592.95 E:0.125119 |  makes the little burst down the right, Neto plays back again to Chalabar, he thinks it's
[1173.48 - 1177.96] P:1490.80 E:0.109995 |  opened up on the left, doesn't get the pass right, Sabali to Anthony, Anthony's looking for the one
[1177.96 - 1182.84] P:1502.13 E:0.120432 |  two, Betis shield's got to be quick to cover the ground here, gets a touch ahead of Anthony,
[1182.84 - 1187.32] P:1620.21 E:0.130362 |  runs back to that ball inside his own half and plays back to Philip Jorgensen, yeah it's good
[1187.32 - 1191.64] P:1423.91 E:0.118470 |  to friendly for Betis shield, he comes across, times it perfectly, doesn't dive in, gets his foot in,
[1191.64 - 1196.12] P:1478.42 E:0.108717 |  ahead of Anthony, wins the possession and still because he stays his feet, he's able to regain the
[1196.12 - 1200.52] P:1554.75 E:0.115160 |  ball, Quesado looking for the longer ball over the top, Neto and the Brazilians center back,
[1200.60 - 1206.92] P:1551.73 E:0.112534 |  back pedaling, wins the header, it's tucked away by Bartra from a Barcelona and Borussia
[1206.92 - 1212.52] P:1564.67 E:0.124827 |  Dortmund defender back in his second spell with Rael Betis now, here's Palmer moves the ball quickly
[1212.52 - 1218.04] P:1823.27 E:0.122833 |  on to Neto, Neto up against Ricardo Rodriguez, left-footed cross in towards the far post,
[1218.04 - 1225.24] P:1426.94 E:0.127895 |  headed up in the air by Sabali, bounces inside the box on the right, Madawayke is there for Chelsea,
[1226.20 - 1233.24] P:1760.70 E:0.116075 |  headband, wrapped around his forehead, Quesado with the peroxide, shortly shaven here,
[1234.12 - 1239.24] P:1638.80 E:0.119216 |  Chalabar wide to Neto, Palmer takes it on the turn, again silky skills edge of the box,
[1239.96 - 1244.12] P:1584.13 E:0.105919 |  there's a man with silky skills though knew what Palmer was doing, it was Isco, stepped in, won the
[1244.12 - 1248.28] P:1716.00 E:0.099496 |  ball, floats a delicious pass down the right to Anthony, buddy of shields stooped to try and
[1248.28 - 1253.72] P:1645.30 E:0.109125 |  headed away, Anthony just beaten to it, infield it comes to the can boom, Muresca looking a little
[1253.80 - 1260.36] P:1745.65 E:0.112830 |  concerned here as Chelsea get back, now they do and Isco's there on the halfway line and he's
[1260.36 - 1265.72] P:1425.02 E:0.119902 |  not always in the game every second of the game Isco but the touches when he gets on the ball
[1265.72 - 1272.52] P:1791.89 E:0.107118 |  and Adde's on the ball, for Rael Betis, darts inside, lays it back Cardoso misses from 12 yards
[1272.52 - 1277.32] P:1789.04 E:0.095068 |  out, side-footed it wide, glorious chance for Betis to go tune it up in the final.
[1277.32 - 1281.64] P:1692.02 E:0.096029 |  Ah huge chance, absolutely huge chance, it comes from that right-hand side again,
[1281.72 - 1287.88] P:1824.96 E:0.084368 |  Malagusto loses the ball, just can't get to it as the ball pops up as initially you can see
[1287.88 - 1293.32] P:1587.59 E:0.104775 |  Adde's got the ball, comes inside, takes a really heavy touch, Malagusto lunges across to try and
[1293.32 - 1298.68] P:1474.43 E:0.105060 |  win that ball, misses it and it just falls to Adde and he plays it square and that's that shot,
[1298.68 - 1302.84] P:1515.65 E:0.115274 |  it just gets it, I think it's a deflection isn't it, on the way through over the crossbar, so in
[1302.84 - 1307.48] P:1763.47 E:0.109012 |  the end it's last six defending that prevents Chelsea from going 2-0 down. Yeah I thought Cardoso
[1307.48 - 1311.40] P:1695.78 E:0.116022 |  had sliced it wide, buddy of shield got close enough to get a block on the shot, it's gone behind
[1311.40 - 1318.12] P:1624.18 E:0.126421 |  for a corner, Isco delivers headed away by Chelsea, it falls to Sibali here, the Betis right back,
[1318.12 - 1323.24] P:1450.73 E:0.130217 |  comes wide to Isco, passes through the legs of Jackson, Sibali continues to run, then can't keep
[1323.24 - 1329.32] P:1578.68 E:0.108570 |  his feet and the flag goes up, I think for an offside, anyway pre-kick Chelsea in the left back
[1329.32 - 1333.56] P:1392.00 E:0.114928 |  position, the point I was trying to make there Mark was Isco, you know popped up on the edge of
[1333.56 - 1337.80] P:1678.89 E:0.119659 |  his own penalty area, saw the danger of Palmer nipped into the ball off him, then he pops up
[1337.80 - 1342.36] P:1821.90 E:0.113493 |  inside his own half just saw the half way line, it's just the little touches and passes and
[1342.36 - 1348.52] P:1634.78 E:0.113984 |  this guy, he is a genius. Yeah I mean the quality on the ball, every every involvement he has
[1349.08 - 1352.76] P:1327.86 E:0.112924 |  has a big influence on what Betis do, whether it's going forward, whether it's defending like
[1352.76 - 1358.52] P:1304.14 E:0.123664 |  you mentioned there, that last sort of intervention on Cole Palmer, popping up from nowhere to the
[1358.52 - 1363.00] P:1438.99 E:0.111739 |  pass that leads to the goal, everything that happens, the free kicks of the corners, he is the
[1363.00 - 1366.04] P:1813.90 E:0.130256 |  man that's in the middle of it, the heart of it, he's the one delivering it all.
[1367.08 - 1374.36] P:1867.45 E:0.126198 |  Ball is with Chelsea's goalkeeper, Philip Jorgensen, five-lie, BBC Sound, BBC Radio London tonight,
[1374.92 - 1382.36] P:1573.22 E:0.117926 |  live from Brotswaw in Poland, Chelsea have got a game on their hands, Real Betis lead 1-0,
[1382.36 - 1387.48] P:1610.38 E:0.115715 |  Abdey's goal in the ninth minute, Jorgensen's had to make a flying save from the barter shot that
[1387.48 - 1393.64] P:1646.21 E:0.116817 |  was heading for the top corner, and Badi Ashile with the block on the Cardoso effort as well.
[1393.64 - 1399.32] P:1510.93 E:0.118693 |  Gusto just outside his own box, high ball locked towards Palmer, over Palmer's head,
[1399.32 - 1404.60] P:1362.57 E:0.125276 |  headed away by Ricardo Rodriguez, Abdey lays it back to Cardoso, back in his feet from the
[1404.60 - 1409.88] P:1509.52 E:0.125649 |  American international, pass out to the left, Cardoso continues to run, Abdey was caught by
[1409.88 - 1416.44] P:1817.95 E:0.123545 |  Gusto and that is another free kick for Real Betis. Yeah it's not been the game for Malagusta so far,
[1416.52 - 1420.28] P:1443.72 E:0.114358 |  like he just needs to breathe a little bit, he needs to take his foot off the pedal in a little
[1420.28 - 1423.80] P:1422.62 E:0.118561 |  bit, he's trying to, you know, sometimes you chase the game, it's just dive, didn't he,
[1423.80 - 1428.76] P:1514.45 E:0.113066 |  doesn't need to dive in, I mean it's nothing major, but it's just a little niggly foul again,
[1428.76 - 1432.68] P:1585.12 E:0.113952 |  and that's off the back of giving the ball away a couple of times already.
[1434.84 - 1440.20] P:1582.89 E:0.116214 |  Abdey, who scored in both legs of the semi-final against Fiorentina as did Anthony,
[1441.00 - 1444.84] P:1219.89 E:0.129206 |  didn't start the second leg away to Fiorentina, which actually finished 2-2
[1444.92 - 1451.32] P:1409.61 E:0.111243 |  after extra time and took Betis through 4-3 on aggregate, but tonight has started and has made
[1451.32 - 1456.84] P:1543.26 E:0.109897 |  a real impact, he scored the goal. Here is Anthony, still on loan from Manchester United, playing
[1456.84 - 1463.16] P:1498.91 E:0.110553 |  for Betis here, had a massive impact on the team since arriving, the ball is back with
[1463.16 - 1472.44] P:1354.37 E:0.118353 |  the Real Betis goalkeeper, Adria, 38 years old now, Natan, shitball down the inside left channel,
[1473.08 - 1480.04] P:1561.25 E:0.127893 |  Abdey jumps, can't keep it for Betis, Quesado holding off Abdey, under pressure from Isco as
[1480.04 - 1486.44] P:1619.03 E:0.108845 |  well, foul by Abdey, free kick Chelsea just short of the halfway line, coming into 25 minutes played
[1487.56 - 1493.48] P:1468.59 E:0.126544 |  in the first half, next football for you commentary-wise is Friday night, women's
[1493.48 - 1499.16] P:1526.94 E:0.124323 |  UEFA Nations League action, England play Portugal at Wembley, last two group games for them,
[1499.80 - 1504.52] P:1433.42 E:0.127602 |  they're away to Spain on Tuesday, they start Friday night, two points behind Spain in the group,
[1505.64 - 1509.88] P:1480.22 E:0.118196 |  all about preparations for the Euros this summer as well, Wales at the tournament in
[1509.88 - 1514.36] P:1966.91 E:0.111780 |  England's group, commentary on their game against Denmark in the Nations League on Friday night,
[1514.36 - 1522.68] P:1866.82 E:0.111161 |  sports extra three at 6.15, here's Mattauakie, facing his own goal deep inside his own heart,
[1522.68 - 1527.88] P:1647.12 E:0.128424 |  back to Badia Shield, good pace on the pass to Gusto, Isco comes racing back to make the challenge,
[1527.88 - 1532.28] P:1417.11 E:0.121362 |  fouls him, Gusto takes the free kick quickly, nearly lost the ball there and gave it away,
[1532.28 - 1537.32] P:1567.17 E:0.130923 |  Kukerea retrieves possession for Chelsea, here's Badia Shield, Gusto again, not a good ball,
[1537.96 - 1545.32] P:1404.07 E:0.116604 |  Betis have won it inside the Chelsea half, spaces to the left, Bornau finds Isco, drops a shoulder,
[1545.32 - 1549.64] P:1676.18 E:0.115300 |  just rolls the ball to his left to Abdey, low cross into the box, miscue by Chalabar,
[1549.64 - 1554.20] P:1710.93 E:0.108848 |  falls to Kukerea, has time to think about the clearance here and it's going to use the speed
[1554.28 - 1559.16] P:1732.03 E:0.109838 |  of Jackson running away down the middle, Jackson up against two Betis defenders, he beat Natan,
[1559.16 - 1565.00] P:1580.29 E:0.110053 |  he couldn't beat Bartra, Adrian keeps the ball in down by the dead ball line and is able to pick it up.
[1566.60 - 1571.00] P:1547.95 E:0.123395 |  Yeah it's a long, it's kind of a long hopeful ball and Jackson does really well against two
[1571.00 - 1577.00] P:1568.19 E:0.106105 |  of the Betis defenders there, he beats the first one as he tucks inside, just can't get ahead of
[1577.00 - 1581.96] P:1694.30 E:0.098845 |  Mattauakie, Mattauakie manages to get back in time and just topo the ball back in the direction
[1581.96 - 1585.40] P:1580.83 E:0.086282 |  of the goal line and that's when Adrian comes out and collects it quite comfortably,
[1585.40 - 1590.52] P:1265.71 E:0.107123 |  but again, Marlo Gusto, he's just, at the moment nothing seems to be going right for him,
[1590.52 - 1594.68] P:1663.88 E:0.100916 |  every time he touches the ball, every time he looks to lay it off, challenge, it's just,
[1594.68 - 1598.44] P:1357.69 E:0.105299 |  it's just falling apart from him, it's not right, it's not falling from him at the moment.
[1598.44 - 1604.44] P:1489.71 E:0.115909 |  Only his second start in the last 11 games for Chelsea, so potentially a sort of eyebrow
[1604.44 - 1609.48] P:1643.12 E:0.110760 |  raising selection this evening, Rhys James is on the bench, Enzo Muresca has managed to get more
[1609.48 - 1616.84] P:1536.16 E:0.111968 |  football out of him this season, for a little while, for Chelsea, five changes for Chelsea
[1616.84 - 1622.12] P:1917.37 E:0.096701 |  tonight from the 1-0 win, Nottingham Forest on Sunday, find themselves behind against Rail Betis,
[1622.92 - 1631.48] P:2000.02 E:0.110978 |  20 minutes remaining in the first half, Ball, Wittnetto, wide on the right, brings it in field,
[1631.48 - 1637.32] P:1805.47 E:0.109579 |  he's followed by Abde, passes back to Badiasil, straight up the middle of the pitch to Caesado,
[1637.32 - 1642.52] P:1794.02 E:0.104969 |  across it comes to Fernandez, stretches to control, it quickly moves it on to Mattawaykis,
[1642.52 - 1647.32] P:1815.29 E:0.105937 |  Savali is back in position to cover to Chelsea, when he goes back to Cucaraya, little 1-2 with
[1647.32 - 1651.80] P:1890.43 E:0.094976 |  Caesado, then Cucaraya looks for the pass down the touch line, Anthony makes the challenge,
[1651.80 - 1656.92] P:1814.63 E:0.109232 |  and Chelsea win the throw. Yeah, Betis being really good, just every time that ball goes
[1656.92 - 1661.64] P:1774.83 E:0.097101 |  in the midfield to Caesado, two Fernandez, they're just on him, every time they've got the ball back
[1661.64 - 1666.36] P:1454.80 E:0.101087 |  to the ball, because Chelsea are looking for those little passes inside all the time, and Betis at
[1666.36 - 1671.00] P:1351.16 E:0.114115 |  the moment have got it under control, they're just waiting for it, the minute that ball goes in there
[1671.00 - 1677.56] P:1821.27 E:0.113086 |  their pounce. First major European final for Rail Betis, they lead Chelsea 1-0, Mattawaykis
[1677.56 - 1681.88] P:1948.93 E:0.108283 |  on the corner of the Betis penalty area, Wall of Green and White in front of him, goes dancing
[1681.88 - 1687.40] P:1773.36 E:0.118004 |  down the left hand side, Parth is blocked by Savali, whistling at the Betis fans, trying to
[1687.40 - 1692.68] P:2022.25 E:0.106463 |  distract him back, it comes to Cucaraya, Badiasil on the ball, for Chelsea, blue shirts, blue
[1692.68 - 1698.44] P:2047.48 E:0.108566 |  shorts, white numbers on the back, Gusto back here to Chalabar, Chelsea have been forced back to the
[1698.44 - 1703.32] P:1992.47 E:0.114775 |  halfway line, Badiasil gets his head up, doesn't really see an option ahead, Cucaraya tries to
[1703.32 - 1707.88] P:1658.45 E:0.109418 |  slide one through the middle, might break to Fernandez just too far ahead of him, Adrienne saw the danger,
[1707.88 - 1715.08] P:1705.80 E:0.099058 |  comes rushing out and thumps it away with his right foot, Betis 1, Chelsea 0. Almost coming
[1715.08 - 1719.88] P:1849.31 E:0.099343 |  favour of Chelsea there, in the end it just was a little bit too heavy, in the end Adrienne had
[1719.88 - 1724.28] P:1937.89 E:0.104313 |  the opportunity to rush out of his goal outside the box and just put his foot right behind it.
[1725.48 - 1730.60] P:1878.58 E:0.101362 |  First final for Rael Betis, first semi-final this season as well because their previous
[1730.60 - 1735.48] P:1745.30 E:0.098315 |  best in European competition was a couple of quarter-finals, one in the cup when his cup back in
[1735.48 - 1741.00] P:1826.35 E:0.108513 |  the 70s, late 70s when they lost to Dino Mamosco, the last one actually against Chelsea
[1741.72 - 1747.80] P:1826.42 E:0.108495 |  in the quarter-finals of the cup when his cup back in 1998, Chelsea won 5-2 on aggregate,
[1747.88 - 1754.36] P:1775.68 E:0.104360 |  first leg they won away from home, 2-1, Torre Andre Flogot 2, second leg they won 3-1 at Stamford
[1754.36 - 1757.80] P:1777.02 E:0.106958 |  Bridge and Gianfranco Zola of course scored the winner in the final,
[1760.36 - 1764.76] P:1723.48 E:0.107031 |  against Stuttgart to win the cup when his cup for Chelsea there, behind in the conference
[1764.76 - 1768.84] P:1680.75 E:0.111318 |  league final tonight, they're attacking down the left, Maduakis crossing, nearly finds Jackson,
[1768.84 - 1773.96] P:1497.18 E:0.117045 |  he got a touch on the ball, couldn't control it, Sabali passes out, Cucaraya is there to intercept,
[1773.96 - 1779.88] P:1722.20 E:0.108652 |  Anthony is flat on his back but it goes out for a throw in to Rael Betis in the right back position,
[1779.88 - 1783.80] P:1628.88 E:0.109327 |  yeah it was better from Chelsea this time down the left hand side, Maduakis the first time
[1783.80 - 1788.60] P:1654.53 E:0.101655 |  really just sort of took a touch, took on the defender, finds a bit of space, looks to find,
[1789.24 - 1793.88] P:1753.03 E:0.107957 |  hit it to that near polished area, Jackson's coming towards it and then it's just good defending,
[1793.88 - 1797.80] P:1584.25 E:0.103168 |  a little bit late to getting on the end of it for Jackson but it's better.
[1798.52 - 1804.68] P:1603.23 E:0.093316 |  The camboo jumps, tries to control the ball in midair, handles it as he does so for a kick
[1804.68 - 1810.20] P:1669.12 E:0.111280 |  for Chelsea, Caesero takes that quickly, here's Gusto who has had a shaky first half hour
[1811.08 - 1816.68] P:1546.97 E:0.126145 |  for Chelsea the young Frenchman, Bani Ashil, left footed centre back draws his man in,
[1816.68 - 1822.44] P:1592.19 E:0.105397 |  goes wide to Cucaraya, can't find Maduakis, loose ball, collected by four nows, won this
[1822.52 - 1828.44] P:1492.12 E:0.105650 |  competition with West Ham two seasons ago, Abdey's got space again here for Rael Betis on the left
[1828.44 - 1832.84] P:1741.95 E:0.105632 |  hand side, Gusto back pedaling Abdey, screams past him, deflected cross into the side netting
[1832.84 - 1837.48] P:1682.95 E:0.107574 |  and that will go behind for a Rael Betis corner. Mala Gusto does really really well in the end,
[1837.48 - 1843.24] P:1648.04 E:0.098088 |  it looks like he's been beaten all down, Abdey just put his head down and a turn of speed past him
[1843.24 - 1848.36] P:1789.64 E:0.096376 |  but Gusto does really really well, diving challenge gets that block right at the depth.
[1849.32 - 1854.68] P:1742.26 E:0.102250 |  Saw a close up of those Rael Betis shirts all laid out in the dressing rooms here at Stadion
[1854.68 - 1860.20] P:1503.42 E:0.112373 |  Brotswad before the game, white panel on the back with the green number, the words forever green
[1860.20 - 1864.28] P:1621.10 E:0.103410 |  written underneath, here's Isko, little touch inside the penalty area, dances past one challenge,
[1864.28 - 1869.08] P:1604.54 E:0.109071 |  lays it back, Rodriguez gets a shot away, no power, blocked, Palmer then, side footed to ball
[1869.08 - 1873.48] P:1824.87 E:0.099718 |  towards Mala Ueke and Chelsea looking dangerous on the counter, Mala Ueke can get there first,
[1873.56 - 1878.76] P:1829.30 E:0.113080 |  Gusto goes bombing on past him on the left hand side, Mala Ueke sees blue shirts on the right
[1878.76 - 1883.88] P:2094.82 E:0.118016 |  and Betis desperately trying to get back in numbers, netto, scurrying forward with the ball
[1883.88 - 1889.40] P:1992.27 E:0.117825 |  at his feet, Palmer wants it, gets it, cross comes into the box, Natan heads it away, Abdey is there,
[1889.40 - 1895.24] P:1542.94 E:0.110920 |  nods it down, four nows on the spin, Hoyset high in the air, Badi Ashile is underneath it, controls
[1895.24 - 1900.04] P:1500.74 E:0.125097 |  it with the in step of his left boot and then passes back to Kupar Raya and Chelsea start again
[1900.04 - 1905.40] P:1691.80 E:0.105946 |  from inside their own half, so half an hour for the UA for conference league final has been played,
[1906.04 - 1911.24] P:1538.09 E:0.119412 |  Rael Betis scored in the ninth minute, if you have just joined us on five live or BBC Radio London,
[1911.24 - 1916.76] P:1496.15 E:0.110055 |  you can listen to us on the BBC Sounds app as well, Betis scoring in the ninth minute, Abdey
[1916.76 - 1922.36] P:1793.08 E:0.121307 |  with the goal from the brilliant Isko pass, Chelsea trying to get back into the game, yet to test
[1922.36 - 1927.88] P:1698.79 E:0.125686 |  Adrienne, netto on the right, gets the cross in beyond Adrienne, beyond everyone, it bounces,
[1927.88 - 1933.40] P:1619.48 E:0.122245 |  collected by Madelowek, skills from him, Sabali's not falling for any of that, makes the tackle,
[1933.40 - 1937.16] P:1678.58 E:0.106987 |  Chelsea win the corner, I think that's first corner of the game for Chelsea.
[1937.16 - 1941.72] P:1378.00 E:0.111862 |  Yeah, could well be there, Sabali just stands his ground, doesn't really have to do much,
[1941.72 - 1947.72] P:1646.43 E:0.101516 |  Manawiki ties it, he's throwing his legs over the balls, dummies, step overs, he just runs straight
[1947.72 - 1954.36] P:1692.30 E:0.099921 |  in to the defender. Netto's going to take it short to Palmer, wide on the left for Chelsea,
[1954.36 - 1958.76] P:1800.00 E:0.105287 |  Palmer couple of touches, back it comes to Gusto, Gusto's cross, it's Isko,
[1959.40 - 1963.56] P:1827.07 E:0.107638 |  Gusto gets there, flicks it down the line to Palmer, tries to hold off Isko,
[1963.56 - 1967.72] P:1927.31 E:0.102486 |  shoulder to shoulder, Palmer gets a touch on the ball, can't control it, and it goes behind
[1968.52 - 1973.48] P:1839.33 E:0.097555 |  for the Rael Betis goal kick, and when he needs to defend, Isko is all business as well, because
[1973.48 - 1978.12] P:1648.96 E:0.098723 |  he's a playmaker, isn't he Mark, but he does the dirty bits as well.
[1978.12 - 1983.80] P:1488.16 E:0.088557 |  Yeah, he does, we're watching the goal again on TV, Isko's pass is brilliant,
[1983.80 - 1988.04] P:1469.55 E:0.111823 |  absolutely brilliant, and the finish is excellent as well, but yeah, you're right,
[1988.04 - 1993.08] P:1287.85 E:0.115793 |  the thing is as well, Chelsea are quite slow at the moment, quite slow in possession,
[1993.08 - 1996.84] P:1478.36 E:0.100145 |  they're being caught out a couple of times as well, it's almost like they're still in
[1997.40 - 2001.24] P:1461.71 E:0.104781 |  first gear, they need to shift through the gears a little bit more in possession,
[2001.24 - 2006.04] P:1362.28 E:0.107547 |  so when they get the ball they feel like, wow, we've got it, okay, we can hold off, we can play
[2006.04 - 2010.36] P:1400.92 E:0.106032 |  around them, Betis is just timing it really well, they're closing down in numbers,
[2010.36 - 2014.04] P:1560.82 E:0.111630 |  they're putting a lot of pressure on the ball, but at the right moment, and winning the ball
[2014.04 - 2017.88] P:1699.87 E:0.105638 |  off Chelsea, Chelsea have been frustrated, and the quality of passing at times has been really
[2017.88 - 2023.64] P:1601.42 E:0.115312 |  poor so far. Another explosion of noise from the Betis fans, away to our left, in this modern
[2024.92 - 2029.16] P:1799.08 E:0.114376 |  circular stadium here in Poland, Madoeki tries to hit a first time ball on the turn,
[2029.16 - 2034.12] P:1571.47 E:0.108150 |  took his eyes off the ball, and missed it completely, air shot, goes out for a throw into Betis.
[2034.12 - 2037.56] P:1494.36 E:0.107905 |  Well that's another example of it, where Madoeki had time to take a touch,
[2037.64 - 2042.76] P:1536.87 E:0.102099 |  then play the ball instead he tries a really difficult pass, no need to try and rush things,
[2042.76 - 2046.76] P:1549.59 E:0.100431 |  there's still a lot of time to play in this game, they need to take their time, calm down a little
[2046.76 - 2052.92] P:1418.86 E:0.106576 |  bit, find some rhythm. Anthony flicks ahead of forward, you heard the howl from the cambo,
[2052.92 - 2058.04] P:1698.01 E:0.110954 |  thought he was fouled as he tried to control it, it's with Nicholas Jackson, Cardoso behind him,
[2058.04 - 2063.24] P:1752.39 E:0.108613 |  four nows, plays the pass away, the referee then decides to blow for a foul on Nicholas Jackson,
[2063.40 - 2068.84] P:1329.13 E:0.117453 |  so Chelsea would get a free kick midway inside the rail, Betis half, 12 minutes remaining
[2068.84 - 2075.00] P:1424.86 E:0.128677 |  in the first half, here's Kaisado, backheels the ball to himself, then uses Badi Ashil,
[2075.56 - 2081.88] P:1601.81 E:0.125697 |  crossed the chalabar on the halfway line here with Gusto, forward to Kaisado, Kaisado's scoop
[2081.88 - 2088.12] P:1375.95 E:0.120616 |  pass looking for Parma, Natan heads it away, Cardoso is there, controls it, uses Rodriguez in
[2088.12 - 2094.12] P:1425.48 E:0.113907 |  the left back position, the cambo, chest the ball to his left hand side, the cambo gets it back
[2094.12 - 2099.48] P:1801.25 E:0.096193 |  from Abdey and then Isco looking for the Abdey, run down the left, passes beyond him and Jorgensen
[2099.48 - 2105.64] P:1596.29 E:0.109551 |  is able to come out and get it for Chelsea, they start to build from the back, here's Gusto in
[2105.64 - 2110.68] P:1557.65 E:0.111537 |  central midfield, across to Enzo Fernandez, captains arm back, bright green tonight, wrapped
[2110.68 - 2118.44] P:1490.65 E:0.114954 |  around his left bicep, right hand, strap with a white bandage, chalabar, tall figure at center
[2118.44 - 2126.12] P:1449.89 E:0.103746 |  back for Chelsea, little one two with Gusto, plays across to Kukereya, Kukereya thinks about
[2126.12 - 2130.92] P:1903.19 E:0.123151 |  using Madiwaki on the left, didn't think he was on, plays back to Badi Ashil, Kukereya and Madiwaki
[2130.92 - 2137.96] P:1856.39 E:0.127760 |  both throw their arms up as if to say well, didn't get that right, here's Parma, halfway line,
[2137.96 - 2142.84] P:1545.56 E:0.115431 |  wide on the right, swings the left boot at the ball to pass it back, cross the Chelsea back four,
[2142.84 - 2147.64] P:1756.67 E:0.110650 |  forward straight here to Kaisato, Gusto's made the run down the inside right channel, ball bounces
[2147.64 - 2152.68] P:1703.54 E:0.109690 |  in front of him, gets their first head of Natan, lays it back here to Pedro, Parma's in support,
[2152.68 - 2157.56] P:1820.10 E:0.098490 |  Pedro's going to try left footed shot, ambitious and kills it well wider the target. Yeah,
[2157.56 - 2162.92] P:1493.07 E:0.102434 |  wasteful opportunity there, Neto has a lot of time, he has too many options in the end, the sides
[2162.92 - 2168.12] P:1543.81 E:0.094678 |  shot himself as he tucks inside from the corner of the A&R box, he just gets underneath it and
[2168.12 - 2174.60] P:1534.97 E:0.100075 |  skies it and well wide and over the crossbar by considerable margin. Green and white certainly
[2174.60 - 2181.88] P:1601.24 E:0.108568 |  dominates the stadium, this giant patch of Betis fans away to our left hand side, the pitch obviously,
[2181.88 - 2188.52] P:1677.37 E:0.102834 |  green grass, white lines but the sort of UEFA Conference League livery as well is green and
[2188.52 - 2195.24] P:1743.67 E:0.099081 |  black and that is sort of draped all over the stadium as well. So that suits Betis, referee
[2195.24 - 2199.40] P:1813.23 E:0.095826 |  thinks there's been a time wasting going on here from Adrianne so you heard a few
[2199.40 - 2204.04] P:1538.92 E:0.114156 |  shrill blasts on the whistle there to tell the Betis goalkeeper to hurry it along,
[2205.00 - 2208.92] P:1589.97 E:0.116081 |  doesn't really hurry it along but eventually thumps the ball downfield with his right foot,
[2208.92 - 2216.52] P:1366.72 E:0.113136 |  the camboo wins the header, finds Abdey, quick ball to Isco, Isco's a stocky figure, bandy
[2216.52 - 2222.44] P:1494.28 E:0.117256 |  leg runner, passes the ball to his left, not seen much on the attacking front from Ricardo Rodriguez,
[2222.44 - 2227.64] P:1376.45 E:0.116558 |  Isco takes over from Rodriguez, Caicedo tries to tackle him, great balance from Isco there until
[2227.64 - 2232.92] P:1799.24 E:0.110888 |  he's eventually shoved over by Caicedo off the ball, Betis are allowed to continue the attack
[2233.88 - 2240.52] P:1358.28 E:0.115121 |  and they've had the chances in this game leading 1-0, Sabali brings it in field from the right,
[2241.48 - 2247.40] P:1502.80 E:0.119137 |  four nails back here to Bartra, Bartra across to Antony, chased by Cucarrea,
[2247.40 - 2253.80] P:1368.30 E:0.118975 |  Antony passes back into his own half, Bartra runs to get to that ball ahead of Nicholas Jackson,
[2253.80 - 2258.52] P:1526.66 E:0.127264 |  got time here to play back to Adrianne, Jackson comes jogging towards, in Betis goalkeeper
[2259.32 - 2265.96] P:1456.31 E:0.119172 |  plays it to his left and Natan, a few more bellowing songs from the Betis fans and suddenly a
[2265.96 - 2270.76] P:1457.62 E:0.118315 |  dangerous move building down the left hand side, Abdey flick on to Isco, makes ground quickly,
[2270.76 - 2275.80] P:1367.43 E:0.127746 |  he's up against Cousteau just outside the penalty area over on the left wing, holds on to the ball
[2275.80 - 2280.20] P:1572.39 E:0.107939 |  to Betis for now, looks for that little switch pass into the box for Abdey, passed Abdey and
[2280.20 - 2284.52] P:1608.44 E:0.116927 |  Jorgensen is able to collect in his six yard box, Mark Schwartzer. Yeah better defending for Mala
[2284.52 - 2289.32] P:1629.56 E:0.107951 |  Cousteau, he just didn't dive in on Isco, Isco was wetting from the dive in, he dropped a couple
[2289.32 - 2294.28] P:1756.74 E:0.104893 |  of shoulders, a couple of stepovers, Mala Cousteau just held his ground, moved him back out away
[2294.28 - 2299.56] P:1594.89 E:0.094477 |  from the goal and Isco's reverse pass in behind was then well defended, Trevor Trevichelver came
[2299.56 - 2303.72] P:1633.50 E:0.091821 |  across, realised he could let it go to the goalkeeper, so it was better play from Chelsea,
[2303.72 - 2309.16] P:1683.71 E:0.106481 |  karma and more controlled. Just eight minutes left in the first half though, they're behind
[2309.16 - 2316.76] P:1618.44 E:0.099071 |  and they're yet to test Adrianne in the game, it's been a very comfortable progression for Chelsea
[2316.76 - 2323.40] P:1636.53 E:0.105048 |  to this final all the way through, very different story tonight, Cousteau on the ball across here
[2323.96 - 2330.36] P:1736.53 E:0.110289 |  to Chalabar, Rael Betis in their defensive shape, longer ball comes from Badi Ashile,
[2330.36 - 2336.68] P:1843.71 E:0.100605 |  directly wide to Madiouaki, good control, drags it in on the laces of his left boot,
[2336.68 - 2342.52] P:1801.96 E:0.122890 |  little bit of skill on the left hand side, rolls it back to Kukerea, he delays on the pass, turns
[2342.52 - 2348.12] P:1927.48 E:0.114857 |  360 degrees, finds Madiouaki in close support, across here to Kaisado, 30 yards out, little
[2348.12 - 2352.52] P:1616.68 E:0.112190 |  chip ball, Palmer tries to knock it down to Jackson, volleyed away by Bartre Augusto,
[2352.52 - 2356.28] P:1614.87 E:0.114735 |  looks to get onto the loose ball on the edge of the box, Betis feel there was a foul in there,
[2356.28 - 2360.20] P:1908.69 E:0.114027 |  the referee's going to let the game keep going, little bit more danger from Chelsea here,
[2360.20 - 2367.16] P:2016.94 E:0.114732 |  late in the first half, Palmer gets it from Neto, soft call high above the knee,
[2367.16 - 2373.40] P:1594.09 E:0.117709 |  the cambo goes chasing, Palmer plays it back to Chalabar, here to Badi Ashile, forward to Palmer,
[2373.40 - 2378.60] P:1638.46 E:0.116264 |  had to move quickly to keep possession for Chelsea, then Cousteau back into their own half,
[2378.60 - 2383.64] P:1656.77 E:0.116557 |  they go and Chalabar gets the ball again and strokes a low ball across the halfway line to
[2383.64 - 2388.68] P:1556.04 E:0.120689 |  Kukerea, right footed pass from him finds Madiouaki, Fernandez makes a burst down the left hand side
[2388.68 - 2392.60] P:1717.25 E:0.110662 |  and then he didn't see the pass coming, he didn't think Madiouaki was going to release that, stopped,
[2393.24 - 2398.20] P:1645.90 E:0.112786 |  all back into the Betis area, not the best there from four nows, Bartre slides in to rescue the
[2398.20 - 2403.32] P:1604.69 E:0.099607 |  situation, Betis were waiting for an offside flag, that comes, it'll be a free kick to the Spanish team.
[2403.32 - 2407.80] P:1542.40 E:0.107344 |  Yeah Fernandez makes that run in the left hand side, Madiouaki I'm not sure whether he saw him or
[2407.80 - 2412.28] P:1558.35 E:0.095005 |  just felt he couldn't play him, the ball by Tommy does play it to him, it looks like he was offside,
[2412.28 - 2417.64] P:1282.64 E:0.122573 |  that's what the referee's blown for, for Fernandez to be offside, again a wasted opportunity for
[2417.64 - 2422.12] P:1450.35 E:0.117454 |  Chelsea and really good sort of territorial positioning, just at the moment again, just can't
[2422.12 - 2428.76] P:1740.23 E:0.109103 |  kind of find that rhythm. I've been to watch Rael Betis at home a couple of seasons ago,
[2428.76 - 2433.48] P:1761.23 E:0.109851 |  they lost to Manchester United in the last 16 in the Europa League, I remember their fans being
[2433.56 - 2438.20] P:1662.42 E:0.105883 |  quite something that night, they have been very impressive inside this stadium tonight,
[2438.20 - 2444.68] P:1570.67 E:0.103587 |  Adrián the goalkeeper, clears the ball from the free kick, downfield, Bacambu is chasing,
[2444.68 - 2450.52] P:1827.95 E:0.121983 |  Kupere is able to cushion it on the instep of his left boot, Fernandez looks for Palmer in midfield,
[2450.52 - 2456.60] P:1476.13 E:0.104733 |  intercepted four nows, quickly across to Abde, Abde is able to turn, face up against Gusto,
[2456.60 - 2461.56] P:1473.53 E:0.123130 |  Neto tries to help out on the defensive front for Chelsea, Isco gets involved and of course finds
[2461.64 - 2466.12] P:1648.25 E:0.120998 |  his man with the pass, clever poke forward to Abde, back to Isco, strong challenge by Qaisado,
[2466.12 - 2472.60] P:1854.53 E:0.100744 |  free kick for Rael Betis, right on the corner of the Chelsea penalty area, they cannot handle Isco,
[2472.60 - 2476.60] P:1926.92 E:0.094486 |  they cannot handle Abde. Yeah they can, I mean there's, I think there could have been either,
[2476.60 - 2481.08] P:1888.68 E:0.092724 |  could have been easily two fouls there, the first one for Molo, Gusto, referee allows play to continue,
[2481.08 - 2485.24] P:1888.41 E:0.099009 |  then it's Qaisado, then in the end who dives in, I'm not sure, after watching the replay,
[2485.24 - 2488.84] P:1989.50 E:0.103359 |  whether or not he gets the ball, we're watching it now, I mean I don't think the first one from
[2488.84 - 2494.12] P:1863.62 E:0.091940 |  Gusto is a foul and Qaisado actually gets the ball, it's a really good challenge actually and
[2494.12 - 2499.08] P:1537.36 E:0.096077 |  the referee is there, he's ten yards away and he gives a free kick to Betis and I don't think
[2499.08 - 2503.00] P:1728.44 E:0.087232 |  there's no way that's a free kick, it's actually a really good challenge. Clever challenge,
[2503.00 - 2508.76] P:1600.25 E:0.113065 |  sort of comes in from the side and wraps his foot around Isco but definitely got boot on the ball
[2508.76 - 2516.20] P:1617.17 E:0.101421 |  and now the free kick in a dangerous position for Betis, leading Chelsea 1-0 in their first ever
[2516.20 - 2524.36] P:1709.28 E:0.104643 |  major European final. Antony scored a stunner against Fiorintina in the second leg of the
[2524.36 - 2530.84] P:1361.05 E:0.111761 |  semi-final, in conversation with Isco, two incredibly talented footballers standing over the ball,
[2530.84 - 2536.68] P:1533.92 E:0.112263 |  spells danger for Chelsea, behind in this final Antony just pointing, ensuring that Chelsea
[2536.68 - 2540.68] P:1796.53 E:0.116291 |  wall is ten yards, whistle blows, short one to Antony, kills it in to the far post, Jürgenstens
[2540.68 - 2545.00] P:1771.27 E:0.108956 |  stretches, gets a hand on the ball, Natan shot his blot and Chelsea are able to get it away,
[2545.96 - 2551.24] P:1880.92 E:0.105833 |  quickly on to Neto down the left hand side, sliding challenge in the midfield from Fournows,
[2551.24 - 2557.08] P:1708.80 E:0.107003 |  who celebrates as Isco scored a goal, I saw him score a goal in the Europa Conference League
[2557.08 - 2561.64] P:1488.73 E:0.128228 |  semi-final second, led for West Ham away to AZ Outmard that took them through to the final
[2561.64 - 2568.92] P:1541.07 E:0.126250 |  and that was some celebration for a sliding block by Pablo Fournows. Three minutes left in the first
[2569.24 - 2576.60] P:1504.35 E:0.115568 |  half, plus added time, Chelsea with two-thirds of the possession in the game so far, trailing 1-0,
[2577.16 - 2584.28] P:1609.79 E:0.109301 |  Betis with six shots on goal, two on target, crucially the goal from Abdey in the ninth minute,
[2584.28 - 2589.08] P:1633.26 E:0.109495 |  Madelueke looking for the run and Fernandez, good ball Fernandez, Adrián comes sliding out bravely,
[2589.08 - 2594.52] P:1656.33 E:0.105636 |  gathers the ball, might have taken a knock from Fernandez as well, good goalkeeping Mark Schwartzer.
[2594.52 - 2599.16] P:1415.21 E:0.106203 |  Really good, really good goalkeeping there, Fernandez is really close to getting a touch on
[2599.16 - 2604.44] P:1335.96 E:0.108483 |  the ball and there's nothing Fernandez can do with the challenge because the way that Adrián comes
[2604.44 - 2608.52] P:1626.63 E:0.111810 |  in, he dives in but he holds on to the ball, it's a really good ball for Madelueke over the top,
[2609.32 - 2614.12] P:1535.35 E:0.111783 |  just gets away from Fernandez, Adrián really good goal, I think he gets a little bit fortunate
[2614.68 - 2616.92] P:1373.02 E:0.108067 |  but holds on to it, good goalkeeping.
[2617.64 - 2621.48] P:1534.71 E:0.128144 |  Very happy there as Enzo Fernandez sort of came to have a word and tried to get into his fee,
[2621.48 - 2624.68] P:1733.08 E:0.113601 |  I don't think it was really apologizing for the challenge, Fernandez had to go for the ball,
[2625.64 - 2631.56] P:1706.32 E:0.104949 |  leapt over Adrián, caught him with his boots but Adrián did the job for Rael Betis and they are
[2631.56 - 2638.60] P:1325.14 E:0.112803 |  doing the job for Manuel Pellegrini and these Boyan fans inside this stadium tonight, Betis
[2638.60 - 2644.92] P:1474.56 E:0.124628 |  won Chelsea 0, five live, BBC sounds of BBC Radio London, fabulous first touch from Isco, Anthony
[2644.92 - 2649.24] P:1395.34 E:0.117994 |  trying to beat Crook-A-Rae for pace on the outside, shoulder to shoulder, both stumble, both get up,
[2649.24 - 2653.48] P:1185.18 E:0.131538 |  his Anthony down by the byline, teasing Crook-A-Rae with the ball at his left foot,
[2653.48 - 2658.20] P:1527.47 E:0.126592 |  plays back to Sabale, little one two with Isco, that one doesn't work, runs to Jackson,
[2658.20 - 2662.68] P:1791.74 E:0.115906 |  his pass forward is blocked, Badi O'Sheer is able to chest that down on the edge of the Chelsea box,
[2662.68 - 2668.28] P:1754.19 E:0.126361 |  feeds it to Quesado, good run forward from Gusto into space, quickly shipped on here to Parma,
[2668.84 - 2672.76] P:1946.75 E:0.128042 |  for nows he's back to try and cover, something Madelueke pops up on the right hand side for
[2672.76 - 2677.40] P:1838.94 E:0.116164 |  Chelsea so they've switched the wingers late in the first half, Gusto gets it, gets that cross in
[2677.40 - 2682.28] P:1579.15 E:0.112404 |  towards the far post, bounces, Netto tries to head it back across, Goldbacher is there,
[2682.28 - 2686.20] P:1565.63 E:0.121153 |  volleys it high in the air, Anthony is underneath the ball, it's already gone over the touch line
[2686.20 - 2690.28] P:1532.50 E:0.116361 |  for throwing Chelsea, yeah better play from Chelsea, their mother, Gusto makes a good run down
[2690.28 - 2695.32] P:1784.31 E:0.106321 |  the right hand side, he's delivery across just slightly overhead, if he hits it with a right
[2695.32 - 2699.08] P:1721.90 E:0.101140 |  sort of pace on that ball, there's every chance there's a Chelsea play on the end of it,
[2699.08 - 2703.96] P:1693.78 E:0.109511 |  but unfortunately slightly over hit to the bounce at the far post area then, it's just a little bit
[2704.04 - 2709.24] P:1606.90 E:0.107519 |  too high for Netto to control, Manuel Pellegrini is trying to get his team, certainly that midfield
[2709.24 - 2713.72] P:1430.61 E:0.119598 |  line up the pitch a little, Cucarera has gone for the longer diagonal here, headed away from
[2713.72 - 2719.00] P:1610.25 E:0.105516 |  Parma, chested down by four nows, closed down by Jackson, gets it to Wisco, layoff to Cardoso,
[2719.00 - 2724.52] P:1424.52 E:0.105872 |  first time ball looking for the run of Abdei, asking way too much here, and Chalabar comes
[2724.52 - 2732.84] P:1508.78 E:0.108215 |  running back, night skies above us here in Stadion, Brotswaw, quarter to ten in Poland,
[2732.84 - 2735.48] P:1575.67 E:0.113771 |  could be extra time, could be penalties tonight of course as well,
[2736.12 - 2741.40] P:1635.50 E:0.119377 |  Chelsea need to find themselves a goal though, have lost a couple of games in this competition,
[2742.92 - 2748.20] P:1547.90 E:0.126322 |  back in August, all the way back in August in the playoff round, a way to serve that, didn't do
[2748.20 - 2752.44] P:1711.59 E:0.116184 |  them any danger though, won it on aggregate and through they went into the league phase as Parma
[2752.44 - 2756.68] P:1663.75 E:0.114379 |  plays it across here to Enzo Fernandez, Fernandez looking for that ball into the box for Gusto,
[2756.68 - 2761.72] P:1885.05 E:0.119770 |  cleared only as far as Fernandez, forward to Jackson, layoff to Cucarera, wide it comes to
[2761.72 - 2765.16] P:1954.28 E:0.121899 |  Netto, one minute about in time at the end of the first half, Fernandez with the curl,
[2765.16 - 2770.68] P:1618.05 E:0.106301 |  a big deflection on this one goes spinning past the left hand post and behind for a corner to
[2770.68 - 2774.44] P:1614.64 E:0.099369 |  Chelsea, late pressure. Yeah as a decent attempt from Fernandez, I just don't think it would have
[2774.44 - 2779.08] P:1707.89 E:0.097464 |  tested Adrian, I think Adrian was making the run across to his left hand side, the deflection
[2779.08 - 2782.76] P:1711.06 E:0.106199 |  just took it that little bit further, I don't think there was enough pace on that ball to really
[2782.76 - 2789.00] P:1910.47 E:0.105768 |  trouble the goalkeeper. So Chelsea's Argentine captain Enzo Fernandez goes over to the right
[2789.08 - 2794.84] P:1707.49 E:0.103287 |  wing to take this corner, 30 seconds remaining in the first half, huge bang, the Betis supporters
[2794.84 - 2799.64] P:1660.95 E:0.106572 |  behind the goal away to our left, the way swinging delivery, Chalabar ran towards it, couldn't get
[2799.64 - 2803.16] P:1563.83 E:0.108356 |  ahead on it, Parma nods it up in the air, Chelsea's got to be a bit careful they don't get caught on
[2803.16 - 2808.36] P:1529.31 E:0.109035 |  the counter, good block from Parma, Sight put it away from Rodriguez, Betis can't get anyone to the
[2808.36 - 2815.00] P:2053.29 E:0.106979 |  ball and Gusto jogs back into his own half and gathers possession for Chelsea, 15 seconds left
[2815.00 - 2821.32] P:2164.42 E:0.110753 |  in the first half, Anthony looks annoyed about something, don't think a game goes by without
[2821.32 - 2826.28] P:2096.49 E:0.120303 |  Anthony looking a little bit disgruntled now and then, Caesado on the run forward nearly bumped
[2826.28 - 2831.00] P:2098.27 E:0.105661 |  off the ball, does fall over, referee decides to play an advantage here, closing second to the
[2831.00 - 2835.56] P:2055.00 E:0.106262 |  first half, Jackson needs to do some of the ball quickly, finds Caesado looking for the run of
[2835.56 - 2841.16] P:1762.45 E:0.106306 |  Cucaraya, headed up in the air by Natan, Caesado wins the next header then Abdey nods it away
[2842.12 - 2849.56] P:1631.17 E:0.109164 |  and the Real Betis fans roar with relief at the sound of the halftime whistle and again the coaching
[2849.56 - 2855.24] P:1859.43 E:0.093891 |  staff, the backroom staff and the subs from Real Betis all get up and try and urge their fans
[2855.88 - 2862.12] P:1969.37 E:0.089719 |  to greater efforts, it is Real Betis who lead at halftime, Chelsea caught out early in the game,
[2862.12 - 2866.84] P:1969.47 E:0.089250 |  they gave the ball away inside their own half and as we've already said Mark Schwartz at the pass
[2866.92 - 2872.12] P:1922.39 E:0.083598 |  from Isco was fabulous and the finish from Abdey unearing, yeah it was, yeah there was all of that
[2872.12 - 2876.76] P:1860.58 E:0.091739 |  Isco's pass wasn't it, he's the one that creates that chance obviously they win the ball high up,
[2876.76 - 2882.68] P:1932.72 E:0.081461 |  Malagruzla gives the ball away, Betis really really quick in that transition and Isco's pass is
[2882.68 - 2888.84] P:1864.94 E:0.085442 |  sublime and a great touch from Abdey and a really good finish as well, Chelsea need to do a bit more
[2888.84 - 2894.28] P:1998.24 E:0.090693 |  to test Adriane in the Real Betis goal, Real Betis could have scored more, Jorgensen with the save
[2894.28 - 2900.44] P:1997.84 E:0.090127 |  from Bartra, Badia Schiele with the block on the Johnny Cardoso shot as well, plain sailing
[2900.44 - 2904.76] P:1963.97 E:0.093082 |  for Chelsea so far in this competition not tonight in Poland, the big one the final,
[2904.76 - 2911.64] P:1774.13 E:0.095349 |  they trail at halftime, Real Betis won, Chelsea nil, yeah Pat Nevin, Real Betis looked really really
[2911.64 - 2917.64] P:1646.89 E:0.093523 |  untroubled thus far, they absolutely do and tactically they're winning it easily just now
[2917.64 - 2922.20] P:1654.34 E:0.097507 |  Pellegrini's got it right, he's seen what the weaknesses are for Chelsea and I think we all
[2922.20 - 2927.88] P:1464.71 E:0.101303 |  can see what the weaknesses, it's the right full back position and because of that he's able to go
[2927.88 - 2934.12] P:1474.64 E:0.091742 |  and play the ball in there and get the man Isco every time he gets the ball, he has a class act
[2934.12 - 2940.28] P:1615.62 E:0.097314 |  but what has stunned me completely is, I think it's really obvious right, you've got three centre backs
[2940.28 - 2945.08] P:1571.34 E:0.095648 |  you're in Vertengusto, you're asking him to sit in centre midfield okay, he's not a centre midfield
[2945.08 - 2950.04] P:1507.95 E:0.096945 |  player, he's the right back who goes and he flies down the right hand side either you know
[2950.04 - 2954.76] P:1489.42 E:0.083750 |  inside or outside he's winger, that's what he's really good at and he's dead good at that right,
[2954.76 - 2960.20] P:1568.51 E:0.088875 |  you're asking players as an inverted player, he isn't very good at that, why are you not putting
[2960.20 - 2965.00] P:1682.25 E:0.097605 |  Cuccarella in now, that's what he's good at, he's great at that, or just bring Race James off the
[2965.00 - 2969.72] P:1604.64 E:0.088248 |  bench now who can do exactly that, he could do that yes he could do exactly that but be aware
[2969.72 - 2974.28] P:1458.24 E:0.093498 |  that Race James you know you one-on-one would defend with a very good quick winger, may have some
[2974.28 - 2979.64] P:1567.42 E:0.095602 |  difficulties himself but I can't see why you don't see that early on after 10 minutes
[2979.64 - 2985.56] P:1622.23 E:0.091867 |  right that's not working okay just tell Cuccarella to invert into the midfield and tell Gusto to be a
[2985.56 - 2991.00] P:1525.03 E:0.093339 |  right centre back, it's fine it's okay it works but time and time again and Gusto looks as if he's
[2991.00 - 2997.00] P:1667.23 E:0.090438 |  having an absolute stinker but he's playing a position that doesn't suit him and clearly Rea
[2997.00 - 3000.76] P:1558.05 E:0.087307 |  betters knows exactly what they're doing there, they scored the goal for there, giving the ball away
[3000.76 - 3005.96] P:1433.95 E:0.089078 |  there, they're just playing the ball into there all the time and now Gusto, he's last 90 tackles me,
[3006.12 - 3010.36] P:1295.13 E:0.096154 |  he's diving in, he's making mistakes, he's giving the ball away and he's really really spooked by it
[3010.36 - 3014.28] P:1469.48 E:0.096959 |  and that's just one of the problems that Chelsea have got, you know I've got half time it's only
[3014.28 - 3019.16] P:1348.19 E:0.093063 |  one nil down and this is where you earn your corn, if you're a maresca this is where you earn your
[3019.16 - 3024.36] P:1390.01 E:0.086281 |  corn, make the right decisions at happy and he's got some decisions to make. Rea, I'll bet it's
[3024.36 - 3028.60] P:1605.70 E:0.095241 |  have been brilliant Mark but you know I mean it's kind of a cliche when people say I won't want to
[3028.60 - 3033.72] P:1716.72 E:0.095354 |  be in that Chelsea dressing room, just looking at Enzo Moresca's kind of behaviour in that first half
[3033.72 - 3039.96] P:1777.42 E:0.083862 |  I really would not want to be in that dressing room. No you wouldn't want to be but you know for
[3039.96 - 3043.88] P:1731.58 E:0.088529 |  all of the obviously the frustration on the sidelines it's his opportunity then to get his
[3043.88 - 3049.00] P:1689.77 E:0.084500 |  messages across to his players in a call and a calmer kind of environment so he needs to
[3049.00 - 3054.84] P:1798.00 E:0.088661 |  have a bit of force behind his instructions but also you know there's 45 minutes minimum to go
[3054.84 - 3059.24] P:1677.82 E:0.088784 |  in this game so they need to get themselves back in this game, there's more than capable of doing so
[3059.24 - 3063.08] P:1594.07 E:0.081241 |  there are just too many mistakes being made out there and obviously my leg Gusto is the one that's
[3063.08 - 3068.20] P:1765.28 E:0.086998 |  been at the the middle of most of that and I'm right, I'm right, Gusto tucking inside he's not
[3068.20 - 3073.24] P:1692.58 E:0.090718 |  comfortable there he's made way too many mistakes that has been their biggest problem but he's not
[3073.24 - 3079.24] P:1829.32 E:0.079182 |  the only one because there's lots of players who've just made bad decisions, poor passes, short passes
[3079.24 - 3085.80] P:1750.28 E:0.092719 |  in tight areas when they don't need to. Abdey Pat, brilliant and Isco as well I can just imagine
[3085.80 - 3091.72] P:1628.77 E:0.086123 |  as such a technical player you're really enjoying watching him. Yeah I mean Abdey fantastic, very
[3091.72 - 3096.28] P:1677.33 E:0.083244 |  good and he's getting the ball and he's looking really good but but it is Isco, maybe he is just
[3096.28 - 3101.08] P:1745.13 E:0.092300 |  totally fabulous and I was trying to think of who he reminded me of because he was, he doesn't, he
[3101.08 - 3106.28] P:1608.86 E:0.099645 |  plays the perfect 10 position because you know British players over the years have not known how
[3106.28 - 3112.52] P:1710.41 E:0.098257 |  to play that position because they go and stand in the area, you never stand in that area that's
[3112.52 - 3117.56] P:1658.31 E:0.102369 |  the last thing in the world you do, you arrive in the area you know between your centre forward and
[3117.56 - 3122.76] P:1659.09 E:0.086295 |  the midfield when the ball arrives where the space is don't go and stand in the space and kill it
[3122.76 - 3129.32] P:1690.85 E:0.095603 |  I'm watching him play it is honestly it is a masterclass of how to do it and then he does, he's doing the things that
[3129.32 - 3133.88] P:1742.51 E:0.096672 |  would kill me or something like would do it the best when the space isn't there okay I'll just drop
[3133.88 - 3139.24] P:1562.20 E:0.087428 |  back into fullback and I'll take the ball there and I'll control it from there honestly he I mean he's
[3139.24 - 3144.28] P:1709.16 E:0.096286 |  always been a delightful player and he's by a distance the best player in that football field right now
[3144.84 - 3150.28] P:1569.63 E:0.092190 |  but today he is having a ball and there was a suggestion he wouldn't even start if Los
[3150.28 - 3156.60] P:1837.06 E:0.086472 |  El Sos was fit fully fit he might have started before his score which is quite astonishing but
[3156.60 - 3161.72] P:1645.61 E:0.093369 |  there's a reason why he's one major trophy he's made of tournaments and he's he's still a class
[3161.72 - 3168.92] P:1542.90 E:0.095824 |  act and he starts his and Pat who was Raquel Mies manager at the Arial? Manuel Pellegrini
[3168.92 - 3174.04] P:1510.93 E:0.100166 |  knows that wouldn't you exactly I said probably the South Americans we know how to do a number 10s
[3174.04 - 3178.76] P:1676.71 E:0.100257 |  and we know how to get the best out and crikey today. Pat, Mark, Ali thank you all very much indeed
[3178.76 - 3184.52] P:1689.51 E:0.093495 |  there you go then Chelsea Nill, Rael Bates won half time in the final of the conference league
[3184.52 - 3190.52] P:1861.10 E:0.087970 |  obviously second half commentary on the way from Poland next we're going to talk Cricket as well

[3238.52 - 3244.60] P:1493.72 E:0.082154 |  anytime soon the brothers deny all charges I mean these are huge social media personalities they

[3375.64 - 3381.24] P:1913.78 E:0.089191 |  conference league in Vrotsvav will be back for second half commentary shortly cricket first
[3381.24 - 3384.68] P:1762.17 E:0.096456 |  Jamie Smith is going to open the batting for England against the West Indies tomorrow it'll
[3384.68 - 3390.28] P:2058.95 E:0.085302 |  be the first time he's done so in a senior 50 over match Harry Brook takes charge of his first series
[3390.28 - 3395.24] P:1862.58 E:0.080606 |  as captain since replacing Joss Butler he's been telling our Chief Cricket reporter Stefan Schemelt
[3395.24 - 3401.32] P:1612.88 E:0.058752 |  the type of captain he wants to be. Relaxed calm and try and keep that calm and relaxed
[3401.32 - 3408.12] P:1487.09 E:0.063640 |  environment among the squad yeah and then just see how the game plays out make decisions on the
[3408.12 - 3414.44] P:1709.85 E:0.054783 |  spot and yeah hopefully the right ones. How do you want your team to play? Aggressive I want the
[3414.44 - 3419.00] P:1332.12 E:0.071552 |  batters to be able to put the best balls under pressure put the best bowlers under pressure
[3419.00 - 3423.48] P:1517.75 E:0.062246 |  be able to manipulate the field score big runs make match winning contributions and then the
[3423.48 - 3427.64] P:1388.29 E:0.079130 |  bowling side I want them to be able to work towards wickets and and have the skills to be able to
[3428.44 - 3434.12] P:1417.50 E:0.058132 |  bowl to a certain dimension or or be able to back themselves to hit the skills so it's it's
[3434.12 - 3439.16] P:1386.79 E:0.067477 |  hard for the batters and in the field I want them to be 100 committed and chase the ball hard to
[3439.16 - 3443.16] P:1178.57 E:0.083220 |  the boundary obviously the white ball team hasn't been at its best over the last couple of years and
[3443.80 - 3448.52] P:1199.33 E:0.082655 |  we're going to try and change that turn that around and yeah get some really good results under
[3448.52 - 3453.64] P:1456.67 E:0.068253 |  the under the table for the for the fans. Why do you think that's been why has the white ball team
[3453.64 - 3459.16] P:1708.75 E:0.062392 |  not been at its best? I think the scheduling has been tough for Joss I think he hasn't been able to
[3459.16 - 3466.04] P:1467.05 E:0.067227 |  have his best players in every series and hopefully that's something we can change going forward and
[3466.04 - 3472.12] P:1365.20 E:0.062314 |  yeah get get our best batters get our best bowlers in and yeah and try and keep it as consistent as
[3472.12 - 3477.08] P:1860.43 E:0.063348 |  possible. Tell us about the team then so Jamie Smith to open he was up to number three in the
[3477.08 - 3482.60] P:1774.89 E:0.060925 |  champions trophy he's gone up another spot what's behind that decision? Me and Baz just have this
[3482.60 - 3487.16] P:1243.41 E:0.079494 |  burning desire that he could be an amazing white ball opener and he's got the strength to do so
[3487.16 - 3491.48] P:1285.73 E:0.078921 |  he's got the the technique to to be able to face the swinging ball as we've seen in Test Cricket
[3491.48 - 3497.96] P:1284.15 E:0.070661 |  he's he's a very very good player and like I said before he can put their their best balls under
[3497.96 - 3503.64] P:1739.55 E:0.055855 |  pressure from any position. Both for you and English cricket as a whole it's such a massive year
[3504.28 - 3510.44] P:1897.34 E:0.060404 |  with a stacked schedule how are you going to balance that both personally and making sure that
[3510.52 - 3514.52] P:1767.15 E:0.069933 |  the white ball team always gets the the best players because that was a problem in the past
[3514.52 - 3518.84] P:1749.66 E:0.071085 |  wasn't it the white ball team didn't always get the the better cricketers. Yeah I think the scheduling
[3518.84 - 3524.04] P:1194.77 E:0.057466 |  is a little bit better now I don't think there's any real lapovers or whatever you call it but
[3525.08 - 3528.84] P:1306.32 E:0.077020 |  yeah I think it should be a little bit easier to have that consistent balance in the squads and
[3528.84 - 3534.60] P:1833.19 E:0.055256 |  in the teams going forward. Last week Brendan and Ben talked about the messaging that they
[3534.60 - 3538.20] P:1847.84 E:0.064793 |  they wanted coming from the Test team it's about being a bit smarter in the media is that something
[3538.20 - 3542.92] P:1713.53 E:0.077845 |  that carries over to the white ball team as well. Yeah I think so we're trying to keep it very similar
[3542.92 - 3550.52] P:1611.96 E:0.062552 |  to Test so we've got very similar ethos which I know I try and do as a player I try and put the
[3550.52 - 3554.84] P:1273.21 E:0.075987 |  best balls under pressure and and I do try and chase the ball as hard as I can to the boundary and
[3555.72 - 3561.56] P:1472.42 E:0.071269 |  give give a hundred percent in everything I do so that's that is the messaging that we've been saying
[3561.56 - 3566.44] P:1563.24 E:0.061697 |  and yeah and hopefully that can stick it in this white ball group as well. Harry Brook with Stefan
[3566.44 - 3571.08] P:1698.85 E:0.097503 |  Schemelt-Stefan is with us now just on Jamie Smith first of all Stefan I mean they've lost nine of
[3571.08 - 3577.32] P:1980.71 E:0.066100 |  their last 10 ODIs so they had to do something differently. Yeah they did it's not a surprise
[3577.32 - 3582.44] P:2135.76 E:0.061902 |  that he's in the team but it is a surprise that he's opening for a few reasons you said yourself
[3582.44 - 3587.64] P:2064.11 E:0.068544 |  he's never done it in in senior list A cricket he batted at number three in the Champions trophy
[3587.64 - 3592.44] P:1896.90 E:0.082520 |  and only made 24 runs there's also another option in the team as well Will Jackson's down at number
[3592.44 - 3598.52] P:1897.43 E:0.069254 |  seven and he's a regular white ball opener but it's just another example of England seeing
[3598.52 - 3604.28] P:1945.49 E:0.072898 |  something in a player and backing them to do a job Harry Brook said it there he's got the technique
[3604.28 - 3610.60] P:1971.95 E:0.077930 |  to face the new ball he's also got loads of shots one day openers have to be versatile and Smith can
[3610.60 - 3615.64] P:2109.97 E:0.072351 |  be that he's got the gears so it is different it's a bit of a risk but it's a great opportunity for
[3615.64 - 3621.48] P:1750.95 E:0.089856 |  Jamie Smith. Presumably the reason you asked him why he's been promoted up the order following the
[3621.48 - 3628.20] P:1965.91 E:0.071405 |  Champions trophy is because it did not go well for him in the Champions trophy. Yeah he looked a bit
[3628.20 - 3634.60] P:1867.08 E:0.080242 |  of a square peg in a round hole and that he didn't really know how to play and he was following
[3634.60 - 3639.00] P:1965.93 E:0.075089 |  Phil Salt at number three Phil Salt was opening the Champions trophy he's a really aggressive
[3639.00 - 3643.56] P:2044.24 E:0.072537 |  player tried to play all the shots Smith looked like he thought he had to do the same thing as
[3643.56 - 3650.04] P:1980.72 E:0.072789 |  well now Salt's been left out of the one-day squad he's in the T20 squad next week so hopefully
[3650.12 - 3655.00] P:2071.94 E:0.070123 |  Smith as an opener can just use those different skills that he's got and mentioned that he's got
[3655.00 - 3660.52] P:2011.78 E:0.078593 |  the gears he's got 50 overs to build in innings that is a a long time but yeah it was a little
[3660.52 - 3666.36] P:2052.13 E:0.070287 |  bit of a surprise and it almost felt like England had decided we want Jamie Smith in the team but
[3666.36 - 3671.96] P:1894.26 E:0.074872 |  the only vacancy is as an opener so that's where he's got to bat. I guess other headlines returning
[3671.96 - 3676.76] P:1860.73 E:0.088113 |  IPL players Jacob Bethel, Will Jackson you mentioned and and Joss Butler who you know he didn't have
[3676.76 - 3680.60] P:1712.25 E:0.093654 |  to come back for this I don't know how the his IPL franchise will feel about it so do you just
[3680.60 - 3685.96] P:1863.52 E:0.073483 |  sort of say fair play for still having the heart to want to do it? Absolutely and it says maybe a
[3685.96 - 3690.04] P:1849.66 E:0.077741 |  little bit about Joss Butler what he wants to do with the rest of his England career because you
[3690.04 - 3695.08] P:1948.75 E:0.070374 |  know when he gave up the captaincy what was it a month ago six weeks ago now he might have called
[3695.08 - 3700.52] P:1949.81 E:0.072040 |  time on it he could go he could have gone off and earned his millions in the white ball game knowing
[3700.52 - 3705.48] P:2012.01 E:0.068258 |  that he's done everything that he could for England he's captained them to a T20 World Cup win he'd
[3705.48 - 3711.80] P:2071.20 E:0.069031 |  played in a 50 over World Cup win and he'd been the captain but he's back he wants to be at his best
[3711.80 - 3717.08] P:1831.94 E:0.063602 |  in international cricket and it's Butler that England need to get the best out of at the end
[3717.08 - 3722.20] P:1804.56 E:0.078223 |  of his time as captain he looked pretty miserable but he's still the best white ball batter in the
[3722.20 - 3728.20] P:1854.01 E:0.075222 |  world or one of the best white ball batters England's best of all time. England will look at the IPL
[3728.20 - 3734.44] P:1975.01 E:0.069027 |  and see that the IPL has probably always had the best of Joss Butler certainly in recent times so
[3734.44 - 3738.84] P:1931.97 E:0.066653 |  now England will be thinking well how can we get a bit of that as well. Thank you very much

[3888.44 - 3893.40] P:1573.78 E:0.099079 |  right at the end and it just goes out for a goal kick for Chelsea but brilliant play from Isco again
[3894.04 - 3901.56] P:1692.79 E:0.110640 |  yeah there's a reason why he played 353 times for Real Madrid scored 53 goals and won five

[3977.48 - 3981.80] P:1596.46 E:0.113629 |  me back actually to the Manchester United game a couple of weeks ago and the brilliant bit of
[3981.80 - 3986.20] P:1648.24 E:0.117396 |  skill from Reese James the crossing to the far post that Cook Araya got on the end of that was a
[3986.20 - 3992.20] P:1598.38 E:0.114870 |  decent ball yeah very good ball just maybe maybe the pace of it just a little bit too much Fernandez
[3992.20 - 3997.16] P:1459.02 E:0.109424 |  just couldn't get the end of it it's got a toe on it couldn't prevent it going out for a goal kick
[3997.16 - 4002.76] P:1552.76 E:0.113413 |  but really good play. Reese James pushing the back knocking the back of the leg as well from

[4036.20 - 4041.08] P:1593.62 E:0.119526 |  second half Betis won Chelsea Nils yeah there's a little awkward one there but Trevor Chalabay tries
[4041.08 - 4046.12] P:1564.40 E:0.117743 |  against him on the end of it misses it and as it when he misses it just bounces up all of a sudden
[4046.12 - 4050.28] P:1448.64 E:0.116494 |  and it's Australian always and it's sort of in an outstretched position Anthony's made a clever
[4050.28 - 4054.92] P:1441.85 E:0.116368 |  run from the free kick the diagonal run from right to left gets the ball Cook Araya has followed

[5723.32 - 5727.88] P:1572.31 E:0.099963 |  have lost a bit I think with with their changes yeah I've lost a little bit of momentum so far
[5727.88 - 5732.52] P:1489.42 E:0.093871 |  but that's because of Chelsea lifting their game because of that being so dominant and their
[5732.52 - 5738.92] P:1263.12 E:0.098035 |  substitutions have had such an impact and all obviously cold Palmer oh I'd say cold Palmer is back

[5775.88 - 5781.08] P:1608.25 E:0.097243 |  knocks it straight into the arms of Adrian they were two on one against the goalkeeper that could
[5781.08 - 5785.96] P:1596.44 E:0.095662 |  have been the final right there no it had to be it had to be the final Nicholas Jackson did everything
[5785.96 - 5792.28] P:1423.91 E:0.107894 |  right defended brilliantly in his own box the breakaway the touch the movement in behind and
[5792.28 - 5797.08] P:1431.76 E:0.113190 |  then it was this what third touch massive touch Adrian just can it could have easily just laid
[5797.08 - 5801.48] P:1585.63 E:0.116766 |  a squid of Sancho Sancho was through could be the turning point in the game let's see what happens

[5821.96 - 5827.64] P:1705.01 E:0.113756 |  wins the header it goes beyond Perot and runs to Jezus Rodriguez I think Jackson's game is over
[5827.64 - 5833.48] P:1661.43 E:0.111799 |  he may well have scored the winner in the UEFA conference league final Palmer tackles Isco
[5833.48 - 5839.32] P:1830.15 E:0.105574 |  referee then blows his whistle it's going to book Palmer for booting the ball away after the whistle
[5839.48 - 5845.00] P:1570.76 E:0.099954 |  gone no he's booking Palmer for for for giving the referee an earful right as he's claiming that
[5845.00 - 5849.08] P:1566.67 E:0.109474 |  part of that Jackson was down with a head injury the referee knew he wasn't down with a head injury
[5849.08 - 5853.24] P:1625.60 E:0.108443 |  Palmer was yelling at the referee and he finally wins the ball back and he boots it out in
[5853.24 - 5857.32] P:1648.46 E:0.104572 |  frustration but it's going out because he wants to stop the player that's when the referee gives him
[5857.32 - 5866.04] P:1509.53 E:0.102419 |  a yellow card possible hamstring injury for Nicholas Jackson here very much played his part in this
[5866.04 - 5873.96] P:1458.24 E:0.098065 |  second half heading in from the Palmer cross for the second goal Mark here is pointing the name
[5873.96 - 5880.76] P:1557.94 E:0.105917 |  of Ken and Dewsbury Hall who may be about to come on for Chelsea which is great for him because
[5880.76 - 5888.92] P:1472.98 E:0.095239 |  he's played such a massive part in the UEFA conference campaign for Chelsea this season
[5889.88 - 5895.32] P:1685.01 E:0.104699 |  and Jackson actually it came from that very last clumsy touch just watching the slow motion replay
[5895.40 - 5899.96] P:1692.41 E:0.098129 |  as he's racing through on goal there with Sancho on his right hand side that last touch of the ball
[5899.96 - 5906.84] P:1696.22 E:0.091930 |  is so heavy he's on his feet he's not pulled his hamstring there but he is not walking freely
[5906.84 - 5911.40] P:1711.84 E:0.087615 |  referee is walking him off the field behind the goal away to our right which he will enjoy
[5912.04 - 5917.80] P:1727.69 E:0.089307 |  because all the Chelsea fans are there ready to lord him for the goal he scored this evening
[5917.80 - 5923.00] P:1655.99 E:0.097275 |  Chelsea wait to make the change but we're looking at the moment Enzo Moresca talking to Cole Palmer
[5923.00 - 5928.60] P:1695.07 E:0.104143 |  I mean by his very high standards Mark he has had a relatively quiet second half to the season
[5928.60 - 5934.04] P:1774.09 E:0.103094 |  but with players like Palmer on occasions like this it's basically taken him five minutes to
[5934.04 - 5939.56] P:1675.66 E:0.110724 |  completely turn the game on his head it has yeah and that's the quality that you have in a play
[5939.56 - 5943.80] P:1682.35 E:0.092577 |  like that and that's what can happen and the question is you know for how long does it go on
[5943.80 - 5948.76] P:1748.53 E:0.089644 |  where it doesn't happen and tonight certainly in this in the second half he's been instrumental in
[5948.76 - 5953.64] P:1720.96 E:0.095007 |  this turnaround of the game obviously there's still time to go this is not done with as yet
[5953.64 - 5960.76] P:1745.29 E:0.080826 |  but the impact that Cole Palmer has had has been huge it's Mark Schwartz with us here in Poland

[6010.28 - 6014.76] P:1846.25 E:0.085277 |  and now Jorgensen has the ball at his feet and eventually picks it up as Rui Baal approaches
[6015.32 - 6018.60] P:1651.00 E:0.103649 |  but it looks like he's come on to try and just disrupt Chelsea hasn't he Rui Baal
[6018.60 - 6022.60] P:1771.35 E:0.099114 |  I mean he's running to Colwell there as he gets up and the referee's not giving a foul he's

[6797.72 - 6802.68] P:1793.91 E:0.089651 |  been whacking away in frustration he didn't aim that at Chalabar and luckily the Chelsea players
[6802.68 - 6808.68] P:1622.73 E:0.094838 |  have stepped in just to try and calm that situation down yeah it's one of those ones isn't

[6813.88 - 6819.32] P:1593.43 E:0.090056 |  lash of the ball in frustration and it just smashes right into Trevor Chalabar could have
[6819.32 - 6823.96] P:1545.47 E:0.092068 |  easily have knocked him over fortunately enough I think he just turned out of the way in time
[6825.24 - 6830.84] P:1833.16 E:0.097839 |  Chelsea players all gathered already spraying each other with the water bottles the substitutes

[6858.36 - 6864.28] P:1791.75 E:0.109222 |  soak him with the water bottles I'm looking for Cole Palmer as well the man who made the real
[6864.28 - 6870.44] P:1760.43 E:0.096479 |  difference his last onto the field strolls on as cool as you like none of those celebrations
[6870.44 - 6876.20] P:1767.04 E:0.095878 |  for him but he made the real difference in this second half Chelsea one nil down at halftime
[6876.76 - 6883.80] P:1687.14 E:0.092844 |  turned it around initially with two goals in five minutes both created by the brilliance of Palmer
[6883.80 - 6889.96] P:1754.92 E:0.092969 |  the first the header prevents O'Fernandez then the real genius from Palmer the twist in the turn
[6889.96 - 6896.68] P:1797.84 E:0.093400 |  and the cross to find Nicholas Jackson the last two came from Jaden Sancho as sumptuous curler
[6896.68 - 6905.88] P:1818.22 E:0.091265 |  and Moises Kaisado at the end and Chelsea season ends in glory ends with silverware a first major
[6905.88 - 6915.24] P:1727.69 E:0.094371 |  trophy in four years a seventh major European trophy and incredibly seven out of eight wins

[6921.24 - 6926.44] P:1813.97 E:0.092985 |  beaten Real Betis by four goals to one March Water yeah no it's thoroughly deserved I think
[6926.44 - 6931.40] P:1807.78 E:0.090089 |  first 45 minutes was one to forget for them a lot of possession too many mistakes Betis were good
[6931.40 - 6937.08] P:1802.89 E:0.095799 |  for their one nil lead at halftime Isco was brilliant and then it looked like it was a chance
[6937.08 - 6941.00] P:1821.59 E:0.095079 |  that just wasn't going to get any better for Chelsea the clear decision at halftime to make
[6941.00 - 6946.60] P:1860.20 E:0.092752 |  the sit bring on Rhys James take off Molo Gusto played dividends got more stability more calmness
[6946.60 - 6952.04] P:1876.03 E:0.088201 |  to the side experience the game changed and of course Cole Palmer came to life and that made a
[6952.04 - 6956.36] P:1818.52 E:0.093936 |  big difference as well he played his part and he was instrumental in those first two goals
[6956.36 - 6960.60] P:1756.82 E:0.087203 |  and then the end Chelsea ran away that could have won more comfortably as well next was Jackson
[6960.68 - 6965.96] P:1904.60 E:0.082652 |  through big touch other than that Chelsea thoroughly deserved to win this Chelsea have
[6965.96 - 6972.36] P:1804.22 E:0.090569 |  completed the set an historic achievement tonight whatever the Chelsea fans whatever anyone thinks
[6972.36 - 6977.48] P:1760.12 E:0.090065 |  about the UEFA conference league they've won the Champions League they've won the Europa League
[6977.48 - 6983.88] P:1825.85 E:0.083849 |  they've won the Cup winners cup and now tonight in Poland quite convincingly they have won the
[6983.88 - 6991.96] P:1846.37 E:0.093178 |  UEFA conference league they have beaten Real Betis by four goals to one much more reaction to come

[7011.80 - 7017.96] P:1751.20 E:0.100844 |  Jadon Sancho Moises Kaysedo Cole Palmer with a couple of brilliant assists we've got Ali Bruce
[7017.96 - 7024.52] P:1670.58 E:0.095035 |  Ball and Mark Schwartz are inside the stadium Pat Nevin with us as well trophy lift on the way
[7024.52 - 7030.12] P:1718.78 E:0.092593 |  and just looking down at the pitch Ali the first thing I saw actually Real Betis players in tears
[7030.12 - 7036.76] P:1923.68 E:0.083385 |  yeah distraught I mean the support in this stadium for them tonight and actually the interaction
[7036.76 - 7043.48] P:1905.24 E:0.091500 |  now this is brilliant Steve from their fans who are just applauding and lauding their team
[7043.48 - 7048.20] P:1819.56 E:0.093667 |  for their efforts tonight the dream was on at halftime played really well in that first half
[7048.20 - 7054.36] P:1966.15 E:0.090059 |  and Chelsea was slightly out of sorts first ever major European final they really felt it was on
[7054.36 - 7058.20] P:1919.25 E:0.091031 |  and it hasn't quite happened for them tonight and the score line looks really bad on them in the end
[7058.20 - 7063.08] P:2033.65 E:0.084470 |  but they're chasing the game and Chelsea have that quality don't they to punish them but I think
[7063.08 - 7067.72] P:2111.39 E:0.094030 |  if you're a Real Betis fan I think you've really enjoyed the run in the competition this season
[7067.72 - 7073.32] P:2008.01 E:0.096142 |  because this isn't a club like Chelsea that spends lots of time in the upper echelons of European
[7073.32 - 7078.76] P:1991.52 E:0.094694 |  football which is why it would have meant so much for them to win it but I tell you what talking
[7078.76 - 7083.80] P:1988.48 E:0.100736 |  about what it means to Chelsea the huge contrast at the other end of the field as you can hear the
[7083.80 - 7091.64] P:1968.25 E:0.096144 |  song blasting out the entire Chelsea squad together linking arms bouncing up and down dancing away with
[7091.64 - 7098.12] P:1959.12 E:0.097412 |  those Chelsea fans and about to lift another trophy Mark Schwartz there's so many individuals
[7098.12 - 7103.56] P:1746.60 E:0.105643 |  that we can talk about and we will talk about as we review not just Chelsea's final victory but what
[7103.56 - 7108.44] P:1687.41 E:0.104489 |  comes next for them after this I feel like we've got to start with Cole Palmer because the two key
[7108.44 - 7113.08] P:1829.31 E:0.106948 |  goals were the equaliser and the goal to put Chelsea in front and they were more about the
[7113.08 - 7117.88] P:1867.82 E:0.088362 |  assist than anything else yeah they were the first one was an excellent crossing of the box
[7117.88 - 7122.52] P:1961.78 E:0.090639 |  perfectly weighted perfectly directed and Enzo Fernandez just running on the end of it all
[7122.52 - 7127.00] P:1934.80 E:0.091814 |  he needed to do was get a touch on it which he did of course he has to be there it's a great run
[7127.00 - 7131.72] P:1958.21 E:0.092579 |  but it's the ball isn't it it's the delivery in there and I'm pretty sure it was his first
[7132.28 - 7137.64] P:1935.10 E:0.098652 |  delivery into the box from open play Cole Palmer and it was a it was a fantastic ball and in the
[7137.64 - 7142.76] P:1945.68 E:0.091947 |  second one it just came from nothing Cole Palmer down the down the right hand side just playing
[7142.76 - 7146.76] P:1928.48 E:0.101798 |  with the youngster Rodriguez as he came on and then dropping the shoal and the turn and the ball
[7146.76 - 7152.04] P:1936.27 E:0.090858 |  into that near post area was excellent as well Jackson on the end of it I mean Chester in the
[7152.04 - 7156.44] P:1814.04 E:0.091953 |  end into the back of an air and that just changed the game it flipped it on his head and I think
[7156.44 - 7160.60] P:1994.18 E:0.097326 |  also the substitutions after that Cole Wall and Sancho coming on made a massive difference as well
[7161.32 - 7166.60] P:1846.38 E:0.106219 |  well Pat we were saying at halftime it looked pretty clear what Enzo Moresca needed to do but
[7166.60 - 7171.32] P:1889.35 E:0.092347 |  I still think we'll give him a lot of credit for doing it completely changed the game absolutely
[7171.32 - 7177.08] P:1883.02 E:0.103953 |  did um you'd have get some stick if he didn't do it it didn't work but yeah like it wasn't working
[7177.08 - 7181.64] P:1825.26 E:0.101559 |  for Gusto because he's not essential my field player just about a couple of minutes after the
[7181.64 - 7187.00] P:1891.40 E:0.095543 |  start of that second half don't you remember Beast James played a ball in from the right hand side
[7187.00 - 7193.24] P:1944.91 E:0.099198 |  he just got into that area knew how to play that area Chelsea didn't quite get on the end to it
[7193.24 - 7198.92] P:1969.10 E:0.095689 |  but the entire game had completely changed in that moment so there was much much more balance
[7198.92 - 7203.00] P:1925.66 E:0.097675 |  we changed what was better in that position and then of course the game starts to open up the other
[7203.00 - 7207.48] P:1994.14 E:0.096698 |  thing is Chelsea have more power more strength than the opposition and they were always going to be
[7207.48 - 7211.80] P:2004.37 E:0.094818 |  able to keep on going Chelsea are generally a better team in the second half lots and lots of
[7211.80 - 7218.28] P:2012.14 E:0.095095 |  1v1s were interested tonight my favorite one of course was Esco versus Palmer Esco won the first half
[7219.16 - 7225.00] P:1889.71 E:0.104531 |  Palmer hammered the second half and those two are beautiful absolutely phenomenal
[7225.56 - 7231.32] P:1935.02 E:0.097110 |  Esco City got there would have absolutely fantastic so uh yeah Chelsea deserved it by a country mile
[7231.32 - 7237.56] P:1969.88 E:0.089793 |  in the end but they had to work for it but in the end it was a bit of a cruise and that's a bit
[7237.56 - 7242.12] P:1937.64 E:0.097876 |  of a relief because that's not hardly Chelsea off in this season Ali I was just looking at some of
[7242.12 - 7246.76] P:1920.04 E:0.091056 |  the the celebrations which are right in front of you there they're almost on three levels
[7246.76 - 7252.84] P:1851.90 E:0.092423 |  Nicholas Jackson going absolutely crazy in front of the Chelsea fans one level down Enzo
[7252.84 - 7258.76] P:1796.42 E:0.087011 |  Moresca dancing one level down Todd Bowley politely applauding yeah and Cole Palmer as well
[7258.76 - 7263.48] P:1924.47 E:0.100446 |  because none of that is sort of I mean he does get involved in a bit of it but when they all raced on
[7263.48 - 7270.44] P:1933.72 E:0.088915 |  at the full-time whistle just strolls on takes it all in you know it's it's it just seems what you
[7270.44 - 7277.48] P:1903.21 E:0.094664 |  know when he plays like that that that is his man he you know he's his pulse rate just seems so low he
[7277.48 - 7282.52] P:1959.63 E:0.095885 |  loves the big occasions he handles them so well I can see him now all his teammates sort of converting
[7282.52 - 7289.72] P:1883.82 E:0.088280 |  around him in fact he's being brought over here for a for a first post match interview but absolute
[7289.72 - 7296.12] P:1892.90 E:0.096222 |  magic in his boots tonight and I think I think Steve really really important win for this young
[7296.12 - 7302.60] P:1855.68 E:0.084753 |  squad as Marcus said and as Pat has said uh as well whatever you think about the competition
[7302.60 - 7306.68] P:1865.50 E:0.098607 |  you know this is a Chelsea squad that's been put together to try and achieve big things and try and
[7306.68 - 7311.72] P:1977.76 E:0.092268 |  build towards that and that's why having started the competition as big favourites quite rightly so
[7311.72 - 7315.80] P:1942.53 E:0.091498 |  they've hammered some teams on their way here but they've got the job done in the final he's getting
[7315.80 - 7320.12] P:1854.71 E:0.087430 |  the man of the match award isn't he Mark Cole Palmer yes he is yeah I said it in the match commentary
[7320.12 - 7325.72] P:1742.61 E:0.084975 |  Cole Palmer is back that's his celebrations that's him the way he played that second half absolutely
[7325.72 - 7331.24] P:1672.55 E:0.091560 |  brilliant he won man of the match and his last European final for Manchester City in the Super
[7331.24 - 7336.60] P:1726.12 E:0.092720 |  Cup as well I mean I know it's an easy thing to say Mark he is a man for the big occasion it that's
[7336.60 - 7341.40] P:1741.38 E:0.084984 |  just how it is yeah he has been he's delivered and that's the difference isn't it I mean Chelsea
[7341.48 - 7345.80] P:1553.99 E:0.090329 |  have had those plays in the past I mean I'm not trying to compare him with City A Drogba for example
[7345.80 - 7351.24] P:1623.02 E:0.090662 |  who would score every time on those big occasions but this is kind of moving along those lines someone
[7351.24 - 7355.56] P:1679.02 E:0.095287 |  like Cole Palmer they need someone to take over so they want to take the reins someone to direct
[7355.56 - 7359.80] P:1651.49 E:0.094651 |  this team this group of young players Cole Palmer's obviously a young player as well but he's got an
[7359.80 - 7367.72] P:1750.66 E:0.095993 |  incredible amount of maturity and the ability to deal with the the big the big uh you know I suppose
[7367.80 - 7373.16] P:1788.97 E:0.093780 |  stadium's the big occasions and that's what he's done tonight once again he's led this side
[7373.16 - 7379.08] P:1838.05 E:0.093943 |  and he's dictated that second half totally controlled it Pat yeah I mean I love watching him up
[7379.72 - 7383.64] P:1744.74 E:0.112845 |  back in the same way as Manchester City I thought Chelsea wouldn't watch when they got him
[7384.28 - 7389.16] P:1741.00 E:0.107776 |  and then amazed at this little period where he had a fade you know and he was disappearing out of
[7389.16 - 7396.28] P:1820.14 E:0.098097 |  games and the confidence that he shows seemed to evade him which is stunning to see because it
[7396.36 - 7401.80] P:1798.79 E:0.096766 |  must be in there somewhere but just recently you begin to see bits of it really coming back and if
[7401.80 - 7405.24] P:1531.66 E:0.102449 |  you look at these numbers at the end of the season they're not bad for a fifth sign there as well
[7405.88 - 7410.60] P:1752.77 E:0.096682 |  yeah right it's a big occasion and big moments and although the the first goal that he made
[7410.60 - 7417.00] P:1709.49 E:0.096602 |  for Enzo was a beautiful piece of work and they do work on it Enzo Fernandes coming from deep
[7417.00 - 7421.72] P:1677.18 E:0.101127 |  breaking the line there and he'll always find the pass because he is brilliant at that sort of thing
[7421.72 - 7427.40] P:1633.45 E:0.094618 |  and had the brain a sort of way however I thought I'm slightly biased towards the second assist
[7428.12 - 7434.36] P:1825.24 E:0.108696 |  being the jinky winger skills down the right hand side the way he's done it there and he right
[7434.36 - 7439.08] P:1833.16 E:0.092235 |  marks spot on he toyed with the lad that was trying to mark him he knew he was going to
[7439.08 - 7443.80] P:1763.42 E:0.100177 |  go buy him all along it was all about getting the ball into the area and it was such a good ball
[7445.48 - 7451.48] P:1855.12 E:0.103900 |  he didn't even need to hit it he goes to Jackson and it just comes off his chest because in the goal
[7452.20 - 7457.48] P:1908.72 E:0.094686 |  brilliant moment there Chelsea just gets stronger and stronger and that's maybe a metaphor for what's
[7457.48 - 7462.76] P:1706.85 E:0.099479 |  going to happen with these young players I'm looking at a lot of them and a lot of them are
[7462.76 - 7469.08] P:1848.21 E:0.100130 |  improving Enzo is improving Casado is improving and certainly Palmer can improve a lot Jackson we
[7469.08 - 7474.52] P:1913.18 E:0.101026 |  talked about before I think my last words before we went to the commentary to start he should be the
[7474.52 - 7479.72] P:1722.58 E:0.102632 |  man tonight well it's got the goal that got got him to one but I think we'll all agree that Palmer
[7479.88 - 7484.92] P:1712.72 E:0.097303 |  was actually the man who did it in the end but you can see it's beginning to happen for a group
[7484.92 - 7490.36] P:1391.82 E:0.085908 |  of those Chelsea players I don't think it's the finished article yet but you can see the direction
[7490.36 - 7494.76] P:1340.46 E:0.088845 |  I also think there's a balance there's a balance of the team wasn't right until
[7494.76 - 7499.32] P:1709.89 E:0.084301 |  Reese James came on Colwell came on and then James Sanchez there was a better balance and I
[7499.32 - 7505.16] P:1896.90 E:0.093748 |  think I also think Col Palmer then changed the way he played a bit he actually was looking to
[7505.16 - 7509.48] P:1802.75 E:0.087260 |  for those runs I think Fernandez had an opportunity running in the box which he did I think it's the
[7509.72 - 7514.12] P:1744.86 E:0.095684 |  different balance of the side when that happened Madiwiki came on the right hand side I thought
[7514.12 - 7517.80] P:1736.67 E:0.101016 |  Neto wasn't really in the game tonight really struggled to make an impact I thought there were
[7517.80 - 7523.16] P:1838.14 E:0.090622 |  two individual at times but when those substitutions were made they actually played far better as a
[7523.16 - 7529.16] P:1732.24 E:0.086203 |  unit and that made all the difference in the second half the second assist that Pat is is waxing
[7529.16 - 7533.00] P:1901.38 E:0.096232 |  lyrical about there was an absolute joy to watch in the stadium tonight that's sort of toying
[7533.64 - 7538.52] P:1827.28 E:0.097454 |  with the 19 year old Rodriguez it reminded me a little bit do you remember Messi creating that
[7538.52 - 7544.04] P:1795.35 E:0.092490 |  goal in the World Cup semi-final against Croatia when I think he scored Guardiola but from deeper
[7544.04 - 7548.12] P:1880.79 E:0.095830 |  didn't he down you know sort of twisted and turned him and then and then created that brilliant goal
[7548.12 - 7552.60] P:1898.49 E:0.090009 |  for Argentina it was just like that it was just like I am taking control of this and there's
[7552.60 - 7556.84] P:1972.32 E:0.096041 |  absolutely nothing you can do about it and what I'm really hoping Steve is that the shirt swap that
[7556.84 - 7562.84] P:1908.71 E:0.099465 |  happens tonight is Palmer and Isco because I think both of those would look at those shirts
[7562.84 - 7568.04] P:1824.84 E:0.093811 |  and remember that final and think yeah he did all right you know what Pat I think now is the time
[7568.04 - 7574.68] P:1525.95 E:0.094394 |  for a mention for Moises Caesado and I'll tell you why he is Chelsea's player of the season right
[7574.68 - 7580.04] P:1533.05 E:0.096681 |  and Col Palmer is the reason probably they've won this final tonight but also they've needed players
[7580.04 - 7587.16] P:1574.50 E:0.097915 |  like Caesado to be eight out of ten every week for him to get the goal and make that his third goal
[7587.16 - 7593.40] P:1554.33 E:0.095867 |  in his 103rd game for Chelsea that felt quite quite right I think yeah does the airman know about
[7593.40 - 7598.36] P:1572.34 E:0.089485 |  as well it's strange with Caesado because he stuck him at right back a couple of times and honestly
[7598.36 - 7603.40] P:1459.83 E:0.095192 |  it was awful just wasn't working at all but it was desperate you could see how angry he was he's
[7603.40 - 7608.92] P:1410.91 E:0.094702 |  kicking everything and moved now he does like a wee kicking a wee nip and down again but his energy
[7608.92 - 7614.84] P:1435.56 E:0.104382 |  levels they do remind you of an Angola can't he different type of player but the energy levels
[7614.84 - 7620.84] P:1484.27 E:0.096101 |  are fantastic and when you see his goal have a look at it again and it gets it's actually him that
[7620.84 - 7626.92] P:1697.28 E:0.099880 |  makes the break he gets away he passes it away but he doesn't serve yeah he's easy to put behind
[7626.92 - 7632.44] P:1645.59 E:0.098767 |  my field up he's not sitting at that point in time and when there's been times of season where you
[7632.44 - 7639.16] P:1616.09 E:0.100089 |  get the last 20 minutes of games and everyone's tiring and he is actually getting stronger so yeah
[7639.80 - 7645.32] P:1665.61 E:0.091250 |  very very important. Ali it's time very nearly time for the rail bettis players to make one of the
[7645.32 - 7651.72] P:1727.49 E:0.087647 |  worst walks in football. Yeah it is they're still gathered around the edge of the penalty area away
[7651.72 - 7656.52] P:1684.40 E:0.091581 |  to our left in front of their brilliant fans in fact some of those fans have now made their way
[7656.52 - 7662.12] P:1735.90 E:0.091511 |  out of the stadium they can't bear to watch this this bit the Chelsea players credit to them have
[7662.12 - 7668.92] P:1745.42 E:0.092540 |  made this this tunnel lined up facing each other creating a tunnel to applaud the rail bettis players
[7669.24 - 7675.88] P:1713.29 E:0.089799 |  Tempers did flair towards the end of the game it was a keenly contested final luckily nothing
[7675.88 - 7681.24] P:1648.13 E:0.099027 |  boiled over between Anthony and Enzo Fernandez right at the end the officials have now received
[7681.24 - 7687.24] P:1772.47 E:0.090024 |  their medals everything's decked out this sort of stage here is is decked out in black with green
[7687.24 - 7694.52] P:1829.37 E:0.087868 |  trim and the UEFA conference league trophy is standing on a on a tall glass plinth very similar
[7694.52 - 7701.32] P:1887.04 E:0.091921 |  to the Europa League trophy the UEFA Cup that that sort of vase shape shiny silver gleaming under
[7701.32 - 7705.72] P:1752.94 E:0.090292 |  the floodlights tonight and it looks like it's sort of got that that bit of sort of gold inside it
[7705.72 - 7710.76] P:1793.67 E:0.091851 |  as well from up here a bit like when they opened the briefcase in pulp fiction never quite see what's
[7710.76 - 7715.96] P:1860.93 E:0.095032 |  in there there's just that that shining gold inside the trophy and the bettis players Steve
[7715.96 - 7721.56] P:1865.97 E:0.096930 |  about to make their way through this this tunnel of Chelsea players applauding their beaten opponents
[7722.28 - 7729.08] P:1870.66 E:0.098512 |  and Mark Schwartz you've done this walk twice and and actually I'm sure you can really feel
[7729.08 - 7733.80] P:1701.22 E:0.099455 |  how they must be feeling the bettis players because both of the teams you made that walk with
[7735.08 - 7741.40] P:1847.78 E:0.096258 |  sort of knew they weren't going to be in European finals all that often yeah that's right um it's
[7741.40 - 7745.24] P:1816.92 E:0.102207 |  still tough though it doesn't matter it doesn't matter when you're in a final yeah yeah absolutely
[7745.24 - 7751.00] P:1775.96 E:0.088221 |  want to win it and and it hurts like anything um to to lose the final yeah it brings back a lot of
[7751.00 - 7755.64] P:1848.30 E:0.087449 |  memories from that but you've got a lot of the bigger pitch and I think bettis down the line
[7755.64 - 7761.24] P:1668.72 E:0.085335 |  will will look back at this moment you know an incredible run an incredible journey and possibly
[7761.24 - 7765.24] P:1731.46 E:0.092071 |  you know not expected for them to reach a final like this it was the same when I was with Middlesbrough
[7765.24 - 7770.28] P:1730.90 E:0.095640 |  in Fulham you know nobody expected us to get to a Euro or UEFA Cup and then a Europa League final
[7771.00 - 7775.08] P:1719.93 E:0.088694 |  and we did so in hindsight it's a great achievement but most of the time people don't
[7775.08 - 7779.16] P:1780.40 E:0.094691 |  remember who lost to anyone or the winners yeah they give it a right good go pat didn't they
[7779.80 - 7783.72] P:1675.83 E:0.106838 |  they did um particularly in the first half but that energy level that they showed at the start
[7783.72 - 7789.72] P:1740.12 E:0.093379 |  you know really pressing high up the pitch etc and I'm thinking can you keep that up I'm not sure
[7789.72 - 7795.96] P:1640.24 E:0.089114 |  you can and absolutely couldn't and for all we love Esco and what he did he's not that type of player
[7796.04 - 7799.88] P:1660.15 E:0.092691 |  and if you're going to do that sort of um pressing against a team that's young and fit
[7800.68 - 7804.20] P:1536.74 E:0.098468 |  you can't do it with nine you can't do it with ten you need to do it with them all every single
[7804.20 - 7810.20] P:1593.82 E:0.087192 |  player has to be up for it uh so they give it their best shot um and held on for a good long
[7810.20 - 7817.80] P:1701.84 E:0.076572 |  period of time but I'll be honest with you before we lost their first goal I thought they'd lost it
[7817.80 - 7821.88] P:1741.90 E:0.100561 |  I thought Chelsea had completely taken control and just as Mark was saying they have the changes
[7821.88 - 7825.56] P:1695.49 E:0.086542 |  they've made the difference but also the physicality they've made the difference as well
[7825.56 - 7830.20] P:1685.36 E:0.096313 |  and that maturity we were talking about before the game it's really beginning to show through now
[7831.08 - 7837.40] P:1658.11 E:0.099984 |  really really tough for the rail bettors players walking down the lines lots of emotion probably
[7837.40 - 7842.28] P:1612.56 E:0.100877 |  five or six players at least maybe more have been in tears since the full-time whistle and they're
[7842.28 - 7848.20] P:1795.17 E:0.096632 |  all just walking past that trophy and most of them are trying not to look at it but now it's
[7848.20 - 7855.32] P:1947.45 E:0.094288 |  Chelsea's moment Ali winners medals here they come first to get it is Enzo Moresca the U.A. for
[7855.32 - 7861.64] P:1789.21 E:0.090646 |  president Alexander Severin the last in line hangs the medal around the Chelsea manager's neck
[7861.64 - 7866.92] P:1781.12 E:0.093175 |  he turns spots someone in the stands that he knows gives them a double wave with both hands
[7866.92 - 7873.24] P:1760.95 E:0.085754 |  and the Chelsea players now tired after the exertions tonight but a spring in the step
[7873.24 - 7879.08] P:1726.98 E:0.089079 |  another trophy in the cabinet and they bounce their way along that platform to collect the medals
[7879.08 - 7887.08] P:1715.56 E:0.085713 |  and then line themselves up on a green bit of carpet to the left of this main stage where
[7887.08 - 7893.72] P:1820.78 E:0.089079 |  Reese James will eventually collect that trophy bring it across the fireworks will go the confetti
[7893.72 - 7899.00] P:1740.69 E:0.097268 |  will fly and Chelsea will celebrate their win tonight Manuel Pellegrini was up first for Real
[7899.00 - 7905.24] P:1855.91 E:0.089049 |  Betis I saw Risco next after him have a last longing look at the trophy that could have been
[7905.24 - 7911.24] P:1843.97 E:0.085137 |  Cole Palmer just goes strolling past that conference league trophy on his left he doesn't
[7911.24 - 7915.88] P:1828.18 E:0.091457 |  seem too fussed about that having a chat with his teammates not him out of WAKE does the same
[7915.88 - 7921.64] P:1830.49 E:0.091422 |  Mark Kukerea follows and we're getting to the point where Reese James will get the medal Enzo
[7921.64 - 7928.84] P:1726.04 E:0.092658 |  Fernandez team captain tonight high five for him medal is hung around his neck trophies stands tall
[7928.84 - 7937.40] P:1777.96 E:0.087335 |  above him in this stadium in Poland and then a word with Reese James who says thank you and gets to
[7937.40 - 7945.40] P:1816.04 E:0.097244 |  do what he will always have wanted to do for Chelsea get his hands on a trophy as the captain
[7945.40 - 7952.68] P:1807.86 E:0.113815 |  holds it in both hands brings it in front of his teammates raises it to the sky as the golden
[7952.84 - 7959.24] P:1839.26 E:0.105587 |  confetti blows out of the cannons behind the Chelsea players and the season for Chelsea
[7959.88 - 7967.96] P:1924.37 E:0.101685 |  ends in glory UEFA conference league winners the fourth winners of this trophy after Roma
[7967.96 - 7975.16] P:1818.90 E:0.100208 |  West Ham two seasons ago Olympia across last season and now Chelsea they will play in the
[7975.16 - 7980.68] P:1834.04 E:0.102970 |  Champions League next season which is where they feel they belong they were under pressure
[7980.76 - 7987.16] P:1825.32 E:0.097712 |  against rail betties tonight but four goals in the second half they cruise the competition
[7987.16 - 7994.28] P:1793.64 E:0.105940 |  and they cruise the final in the end and eventually like shimmering glitter in the air still falling
[7994.28 - 8000.04] P:1724.95 E:0.097939 |  we can finally see the Chelsea players behind it and Mark Schwartzer each player now getting their
[8000.04 - 8006.36] P:1714.85 E:0.094624 |  turn to take the trophy and raise it high to the cheers of their teammates yeah that's what it's
[8006.36 - 8011.80] P:1602.65 E:0.098145 |  about isn't it it's about creating that bond that experience of winning a trophy what it means to
[8011.80 - 8016.68] P:1790.24 E:0.101230 |  these group of players to the club and I think it's really important that they've uh they've done the
[8016.68 - 8022.44] P:1827.40 E:0.094682 |  job they've matured they deserve to win the game and it's something they can take back to and it's
[8022.44 - 8026.44] P:1783.66 E:0.103258 |  that starting point we talked about before the game four players for Champions League now win
[8026.44 - 8031.48] P:1686.38 E:0.096012 |  this trophy and this could be the start of something for Chelsea the glitter tonight Steve the confetti
[8031.64 - 8037.00] P:1842.28 E:0.100851 |  is like hanging in the air all that select a TV image but it's it's like sort of golden snow
[8037.00 - 8043.32] P:1834.31 E:0.097946 |  kind of hanging in the air and all the confetti on the pitch quite a senior Pat Nevin you know how
[8043.32 - 8047.32] P:1941.16 E:0.105588 |  people have looked at this Chelsea squad over the last few years and they've talked rightly about
[8047.32 - 8052.20] P:1890.10 E:0.105051 |  how much it's cost and there have been lots of discussions over the years about how unbalanced
[8052.20 - 8059.40] P:1789.30 E:0.096339 |  it's become well looking at those pictures looking at those players that is a team now
[8059.72 - 8064.92] P:1527.43 E:0.089213 |  very good point it does look like a team it looks like a group that's going to work together I have
[8064.92 - 8071.32] P:1462.35 E:0.095489 |  to say it didn't for a long time and it was it seemed as if it is a massive big net thrown out
[8071.32 - 8076.20] P:1519.20 E:0.102894 |  wide and caught lots of fish and they might actually get to know each other after a wee while
[8076.76 - 8081.32] P:1379.86 E:0.094202 |  um but you didn't see it happening for a good long time but slowly but surely it's been put
[8081.32 - 8086.52] P:1545.31 E:0.103605 |  together this season certainly near the end of it you can see the sense of it I mean hey there's
[8086.52 - 8091.96] P:1623.77 E:0.101003 |  a lot being lost on the way I mean they spent a lot of money and a lot of players that ain't worked
[8091.96 - 8096.84] P:1791.89 E:0.106507 |  in any way whatsoever but maybe that's what was always part of the time the understanding
[8096.84 - 8102.20] P:1791.90 E:0.110410 |  there would be failures as long as it was enough positives particularly a young among the young
[8102.20 - 8106.60] P:1609.19 E:0.097322 |  ones to go forward and but you also have to get a magic to bring it all together and then I'm
[8106.60 - 8112.12] P:1801.68 E:0.108259 |  watching some pictures there Kukareela he's playing to be honest a lot of people would have got rid of
[8112.12 - 8115.88] P:1769.97 E:0.109158 |  him you know a lot of people didn't like him he's been one of the most important players
[8115.88 - 8121.24] P:1894.64 E:0.111274 |  of the team we had a chat beforehand about Anthony and I said to you I wouldn't play Anthony against
[8121.24 - 8126.68] P:1882.00 E:0.105169 |  him because Anthony won't get a touch didn't did he nope he'd never get a sniff because that's not
[8126.68 - 8132.84] P:1975.00 E:0.109559 |  out there and he should have been moved over the other side but the point is when Esca knew he kept
[8132.84 - 8138.52] P:1648.36 E:0.100257 |  up he so he's he's learning as manager he's going forward the team as a group are going forward
[8138.52 - 8147.08] P:1895.98 E:0.101253 |  they will buy over the summer where they are weak so yeah the plan is it is it's not a quick one
[8147.80 - 8153.24] P:1945.76 E:0.106476 |  but it still seems untrack as we're looking at it right now we will definitely get into the
[8153.24 - 8159.00] P:1810.54 E:0.100684 |  where are they weak and where might they buy and who's celebrating down on that pitch
[8159.72 - 8164.12] P:1836.47 E:0.108146 |  might not necessarily be in a Chelsea shirt next season before we do that
[8164.92 - 8168.60] P:1869.96 E:0.097335 |  Mike Schwartz you used the word there as you were discussing the trophy lift
[8168.60 - 8174.84] P:1881.96 E:0.094919 |  it's a bond isn't it you win something together you've been there it bonds you yeah it does and I
[8174.84 - 8178.60] P:1874.84 E:0.097603 |  think that's really important for this group of players off the back of finishing fourth in the
[8178.60 - 8183.48] P:1887.13 E:0.096440 |  Premier League qualified in Champions League now in that they're in their first European final as
[8183.48 - 8190.60] P:1881.93 E:0.094432 |  this group of players this next generation this this project and they've delivered so okay it's
[8190.68 - 8195.48] P:1912.23 E:0.097214 |  the third ranked European trophy but it's a trophy a final that they were in they needed to win
[8195.48 - 8200.92] P:1851.75 E:0.099309 |  to take that next step now they're going opportunity to move on from it and it's great for them they
[8200.92 - 8204.92] P:1861.90 E:0.100065 |  can celebrate they can enjoy this moment but no there's a big they're a far bigger challenge
[8204.92 - 8210.44] P:1909.26 E:0.099283 |  ahead and what Chelsea need to do to get to where they were before there's still a long way to go
[8210.44 - 8219.24] P:1955.59 E:0.089925 |  but this is the beginning I feel like Ali they've got like a UEFA playlist for trophies because
[8219.32 - 8224.52] P:1882.75 E:0.097997 |  they add in the odds one which is club specific by pursuing the women's Champions League final
[8224.52 - 8230.12] P:1869.03 E:0.100600 |  at the weekend these are all the same songs where's Suggs Chelsea won a trophy yeah well one step
[8230.12 - 8235.64] P:2014.49 E:0.097916 |  beyond has gone down very well with the Chelsea fans here Enzo Moresca very insistent as soon as
[8235.64 - 8240.84] P:1969.16 E:0.093011 |  they've sort of done those celebrations with the confetti flying that they go round sort of every
[8240.84 - 8246.52] P:1995.65 E:0.094333 |  part of this ground with the Chelsea fans are to celebrate with them and you know that was
[8246.52 - 8250.76] P:1993.54 E:0.099063 |  interesting as well Steve to watch tonight like we were saying right at the start of the night
[8250.76 - 8255.16] P:1872.87 E:0.097018 |  the sort of feeling you were getting from both sets of fans and how important it was to rail
[8255.16 - 8260.04] P:1914.45 E:0.094876 |  Betis and what a big night it was for them and then gradually they sort of went quieter and quieter
[8260.04 - 8264.84] P:2049.27 E:0.091841 |  as Chelsea took control of the game and they're celebrating wildly tonight but I just think the
[8265.56 - 8271.08] P:2061.25 E:0.099999 |  winning a trophy is is a big deal whenever you do it but I just think so important for this young
[8271.08 - 8277.56] P:2029.49 E:0.095624 |  group of players who they expect so much right I just think it's a major step forward step beyond
[8277.56 - 8283.24] P:1969.58 E:0.089898 |  step forward for the club champions league football plus the trophy who knows what's going to happen
[8283.24 - 8289.80] P:1925.65 E:0.077767 |  in the club world cup and that that that you know five wins in the last six Premier League games
[8289.80 - 8295.16] P:1886.74 E:0.090320 |  when champions league qualification wasn't assured and the win in this as well that that is some
[8295.16 - 8299.24] P:1647.90 E:0.092517 |  end to the season they've already timed that run well that'll be sucks then
[8301.80 - 8308.52] P:1647.75 E:0.101915 |  isn't it what have we got here there you go Steve I knew it was in the past
[8310.12 - 8316.04] P:1603.97 E:0.101166 |  Chelsea fans loving it 1997 FA Cup final song tattooed on my brain believe me um what about
[8316.04 - 8321.08] P:1613.27 E:0.091676 |  that next step then Pat they've got this young group they've bonded them together so presumably
[8321.08 - 8325.88] P:1660.40 E:0.101276 |  that means you've got to keep that group together and only make finite changes and I think you need
[8325.88 - 8331.96] P:1578.71 E:0.100414 |  to make a law um but the changes in the winter aren't playing there's a lot of squad players there
[8331.96 - 8336.28] P:1498.05 E:0.102563 |  and and we know what it's all about now it's all about money and make sure you use it the right
[8336.28 - 8341.16] P:1629.94 E:0.096819 |  ways so there's a good number of players that will be moved on that are not absolutely integral to the
[8341.16 - 8346.12] P:1583.70 E:0.097697 |  group and if they make enough money out of them and add on the champions league money that's coming in
[8346.12 - 8351.80] P:1686.07 E:0.092148 |  as well then you can look at them all sent a forward to help you know the man Jackson there
[8351.80 - 8355.72] P:1565.63 E:0.103548 |  who's been on his own and the only one who's a national centre followed up there who they trust
[8355.72 - 8360.68] P:1810.55 E:0.096223 |  because they don't trust and come to absolutely no chance and then you'll take the other areas I mean
[8360.68 - 8365.72] P:1647.48 E:0.095019 |  do you feel as if you've got enough strength and depth in the centre backstreet get rid of one or two
[8365.72 - 8372.76] P:1707.17 E:0.099101 |  of the four or five you've got and bring in another one who actually is young but also improving as
[8372.76 - 8378.28] P:1689.80 E:0.095189 |  well I think they will probably do that I think central midfield they're absolutely fine maybe the
[8378.28 - 8383.88] P:1780.17 E:0.097784 |  only areas is that right back area I mean we've changed come on and did a great job today um
[8383.88 - 8388.84] P:1603.01 E:0.103644 |  but he doesn't seem absolutely convinced in that area and then there's a goalkeeper as well now that
[8388.84 - 8394.44] P:1721.09 E:0.096020 |  seems a lot for the team that's out there celebrating winning a cup but there's still a big there's a
[8394.44 - 8399.88] P:1566.34 E:0.100364 |  long way to go there's a big big jump between winning the third tier trophy and getting back to
[8399.88 - 8405.72] P:1728.01 E:0.093250 |  where Chelsea were four or five six years ago so yeah they've got things to do the thing is
[8406.36 - 8411.40] P:1715.43 E:0.107596 |  they'll look as if they've got the money to do it and the finances as they are it would seem
[8411.40 - 8419.40] P:1789.43 E:0.098554 |  if they use these sales wisely it could work and I think Chelsea fans can be it can rightly be
[8419.40 - 8425.56] P:1845.91 E:0.102039 |  pretty excited because the fourth is what they've got this season after what someone thought was an
[8425.56 - 8431.08] P:1822.82 E:0.110976 |  average season why not expect more and then you know where the strengths where they have to be
[8431.08 - 8435.40] P:1750.25 E:0.106779 |  strengthened and actually there's some possessions I don't think it's that definitely strengthening for
[8437.72 - 8443.08] P:1801.97 E:0.094550 |  sir going off a bit Ali isn't it just lining themselves up for a team photo now which is
[8443.08 - 8447.56] P:1931.20 E:0.095381 |  going to look fantastic so many clubs do this now don't they Steve but they position themselves
[8448.28 - 8452.28] P:1858.55 E:0.107315 |  in the penalty area way to our right to get that photo with that wall of flu all the
[8452.28 - 8457.08] P:1858.28 E:0.097650 |  Chelsea fans celebrating behind them I mean mark made the point in the second half Nicholas Jackson
[8457.08 - 8462.12] P:1765.98 E:0.102833 |  came off with what we thought was a hamstring problem he has been flying here there and everywhere
[8462.12 - 8467.40] P:1906.05 E:0.097127 |  he's the one who looks like he's going to be the real party animal tonight but that that's that's
[8467.40 - 8473.08] P:1908.66 E:0.105316 |  just scenes of unbridled joy that is a long run in the competition real squad effort as well Steve
[8473.08 - 8476.76] P:1850.79 E:0.095413 |  you think about all the different players that have played for Chelsea in the competition
[8476.76 - 8481.96] P:1846.01 E:0.095737 |  and the miles they've done competition they didn't necessarily want to be in but they've
[8482.04 - 8486.76] P:1843.37 E:0.101558 |  done it they've gone there and won it achieved something and no other club has done in terms of
[8486.76 - 8492.12] P:1759.61 E:0.097861 |  adding that trophy you know in terms of the European trophy so the list of trophies that they've won
[8492.12 - 8497.96] P:1773.69 E:0.097191 |  and given these Chelsea fans in Poland a great night tonight leave I call will speak into TV and
[8497.96 - 8502.20] P:1759.24 E:0.107442 |  reach James let's just read what they've been saying call will it's great to be the first club
[8502.20 - 8507.80] P:1663.22 E:0.094093 |  to win everything possible shows how much it means to the fans talked about coming off the bench I
[8507.80 - 8511.64] P:1629.62 E:0.105493 |  feel like watching from the bench you can see the spaces on the pitch you can see how you can help
[8511.72 - 8516.84] P:1717.40 E:0.097003 |  the team that's what I did when I came on the pitch I could see the gaps reach James it's a great
[8516.84 - 8522.36] P:1794.30 E:0.097274 |  feeling we knew it would be a tough game as it went on we grew into it at devastates devastating
[8522.36 - 8528.12] P:1781.86 E:0.099362 |  when you know you're not playing in a final I want to play every game it's the manager's decision
[8528.12 - 8534.76] P:1774.55 E:0.094207 |  and higher to take the opportunity when it came up and you know what Mark I think reach James is
[8534.76 - 8539.32] P:1813.47 E:0.100360 |  well worth talking about here because there are players within this Chelsea group that you think
[8539.80 - 8544.92] P:1792.87 E:0.092401 |  are they good enough to be part of the Chelsea team at the next step back in the Champions League
[8544.92 - 8549.88] P:1834.69 E:0.094563 |  there isn't that question mark on reach James his issues have been elsewhere haven't they
[8549.88 - 8555.16] P:1842.20 E:0.092251 |  they have been and that's that's why there's questions the questions are is he able to
[8555.16 - 8559.88] P:1906.47 E:0.095435 |  is he physically able to compete you know will his body hold up and he you know went through that
[8559.88 - 8565.56] P:1843.97 E:0.104793 |  horrendous period of injuries and the question was going to be will he come back from it will he be
[8565.56 - 8570.60] P:1776.85 E:0.097798 |  able to get back to the reach James that we we'd seen before and the reason why Chelsea you know
[8570.60 - 8576.04] P:1870.82 E:0.094376 |  were you know game a long-term contract and you know so highly regarded way play for England
[8576.04 - 8581.56] P:1917.02 E:0.101420 |  and we're slowly seeing it and I think there's also element of also still managing him in terms of
[8581.56 - 8587.64] P:1887.88 E:0.099516 |  games played trying to make sure they don't overload him I mean you saw at half time I think
[8587.64 - 8593.00] P:1915.14 E:0.098479 |  he made a massive difference when he came on was it it was I think it was very obvious he just was
[8593.00 - 8599.08] P:1890.97 E:0.095078 |  there was an enormous amount of calmness grinning in the game no no no diving in it and his
[8599.08 - 8604.44] P:1865.60 E:0.097839 |  and his ability on the ball Pat talked about it a little bit afterwards as well about the that first
[8604.44 - 8608.60] P:1779.37 E:0.094085 |  cross into the box where he's just slightly maybe a little bit too heavy on the cross
[8608.60 - 8614.68] P:1613.79 E:0.085477 |  but the perfect distance it was a rangefinder for for Cole Palmer he clocked in on it and that was
[8614.68 - 8618.44] P:1529.56 E:0.094730 |  the one that they went in there and it was a great delivery in there and so Fernandez but I think
[8619.32 - 8623.40] P:1718.23 E:0.096665 |  it's really key to have someone like Reese James at the club he knows the club he's come through
[8623.40 - 8630.28] P:1731.39 E:0.093100 |  the ranks and he's a guy that I think if they can keep fit he can lead this team further and
[8630.28 - 8635.80] P:1692.70 E:0.093682 |  further forward and in the direction where they they should be do you know one thing I would say
[8635.80 - 8641.80] P:1769.80 E:0.101161 |  about Chelsea just now looking at the way they are even those who are not very keen on Chelsea
[8642.36 - 8647.48] P:1701.62 E:0.103288 |  you don't think they'll be washed next year you think they'll probably be as good as they are
[8647.72 - 8652.76] P:1774.61 E:0.104917 |  probably better and that is a really major thing when you're going forward because the young players
[8652.76 - 8656.92] P:1615.39 E:0.097216 |  are actually maturing together they're getting better they're understanding the game better
[8656.92 - 8661.32] P:1737.08 E:0.096521 |  and they're believing in themselves and you know they're going to add to it as well so that's
[8661.32 - 8665.96] P:1579.51 E:0.098016 |  that's something you want going forward it's an easy phrase to say but does that team look as if
[8665.96 - 8671.56] P:1787.62 E:0.093752 |  it's going to suddenly fall apart actually no that looks like a group is going to grow and that's a
[8671.56 - 8680.84] P:1817.91 E:0.102042 |  really interesting thing but I keep on underlining it it's as does Mark third level trophy in Europe
[8680.84 - 8685.40] P:1673.83 E:0.103239 |  we're not talking about winning the Champions League yet there are many many giant steps to make
[8686.28 - 8691.32] P:1835.14 E:0.095284 |  but you look as if they're still making those steps upwards and do you know what Mark I think
[8691.32 - 8697.88] P:1639.42 E:0.093077 |  that's why this conversation is different to pretty much any other cup final I can remember doing
[8697.88 - 8704.04] P:1691.11 E:0.091660 |  because normally the game finishes you talk about the key players what next for them what
[8704.04 - 8710.28] P:1707.34 E:0.092612 |  difference tonight might make well let's look at someone like Jaden Sancho scored a great goal
[8710.28 - 8715.00] P:1664.96 E:0.096313 |  in a European final I doubt that's going to change what Chelsea decide to do with him this summer is
[8715.00 - 8722.68] P:1695.27 E:0.089101 |  it yep possibly not um yeah I mean he's a bit of a normally he's struggled for game time for one
[8722.68 - 8728.28] P:1635.91 E:0.091600 |  reason or another um he's a player that I think everybody knows has incredible amount of capability
[8728.28 - 8733.80] P:1846.72 E:0.091985 |  it's just trying to to tap into it I mean he's proven it when he played for Dortmund that he
[8733.80 - 8738.60] P:1767.35 E:0.090461 |  can do it for a sustained period of time it didn't work out at United he's been hit and
[8738.60 - 8743.96] P:1786.89 E:0.089020 |  miss with Chelsea um the question is do they keep him I mean I know that I think there are
[8743.96 - 8748.52] P:1768.88 E:0.088768 |  blights now to buy in but they can there is a get out but it's still going to cost him a little bit
[8749.16 - 8754.44] P:1785.31 E:0.092292 |  so only time will tell what happens to Jaden Sancho but I still think there is a really good player
[8754.44 - 8761.48] P:1862.21 E:0.085862 |  in there he's just got to find his place um and and uh there's a there's a whole list of players
[8761.48 - 8765.40] P:1825.45 E:0.088893 |  that you can go through yeah I mean there are so many players at Chelsea that I mean you look at
[8765.40 - 8769.88] P:1735.62 E:0.084670 |  Joel Felix is coming back I mean if you look at him you think well there's no place for him in this
[8769.88 - 8774.68] P:1701.35 E:0.094157 |  team how is he even going to fit in anywhere he just doesn't really suit the way they play either so
[8774.68 - 8778.92] P:1751.71 E:0.087020 |  um yeah I mean the list goes on I mean this is a discussion I think we can go for hours
[8779.72 - 8783.64] P:1821.19 E:0.099397 |  and we haven't even mentioned Nicholas Jackson yet Pat who's obviously uh paired off that debt
[8783.64 - 8788.76] P:1780.79 E:0.089893 |  that was mentioned but I think there's a what's next question for for him as well do you think
[8788.76 - 8796.28] P:1638.27 E:0.096387 |  he's the man to be Chelsea's lead striker in a Champions League campaign he will be at Chelsea
[8796.28 - 8802.60] P:1701.90 E:0.100797 |  next season yeah um he is getting better I think he's had an effect this season this season because
[8802.60 - 8808.44] P:1672.71 E:0.099928 |  of the injuries um yeah he's still young he's still growing up people often down at Chelsea they
[8808.44 - 8815.40] P:1716.18 E:0.096439 |  often talk about does anyone really remember that first period of DDA drug bar wasn't it that great
[8815.40 - 8821.08] P:1625.64 E:0.097988 |  really wasn't and then he grew and grew and got better and better so if they believe in his abilities
[8821.08 - 8828.36] P:1822.20 E:0.085465 |  and all the the raw data is there for Jackson the running the moves the pace all it's all there it all
[8828.36 - 8834.36] P:1892.66 E:0.094674 |  works for him whether you can trust in him being the one that will do it on his own as the single
[8834.36 - 8840.52] P:1818.91 E:0.101080 |  centre forward to get you all the the latter stages of the Champions League no he's not he's not at
[8840.52 - 8845.16] P:1830.46 E:0.109463 |  that standard yet he may become that standard over the next few years but he's not at that standard yet
[8845.16 - 8851.00] P:1849.09 E:0.100157 |  that's why I say they do need another striker and I think there are many looking that's why they talk
[8851.00 - 8855.40] P:1666.33 E:0.096106 |  about the likes of Dilap et cetera they do need somebody else to spell it with him because as we
[8855.40 - 8861.24] P:1798.53 E:0.097455 |  seen tonight that chance he had at the end when he sprinted away and then the gasket was completely
[8861.24 - 8867.40] P:1804.47 E:0.096355 |  blown before he quite got to the 18 yaddling so no there's more needed than Jackson but he's a big
[8867.40 - 8874.84] P:1846.14 E:0.091503 |  partner let's finish with proper big picture Enzo Moresca Ali he looks like he's had a whale of
[8874.84 - 8880.36] P:1847.80 E:0.087662 |  a time down there I didn't know he could smile well I mean Steve look you mentioned this in the
[8880.44 - 8885.48] P:1893.17 E:0.087364 |  build-up in terms I mean just talking about what we're talking about there in terms of what's going
[8885.48 - 8890.68] P:1958.33 E:0.089567 |  to go on this summer and all the players coming back at everyone in this squad you have to say
[8890.68 - 8897.32] P:1973.22 E:0.089542 |  real credit to him for steering this shit this season and picking the players for certain competitions
[8897.32 - 8901.64] P:1878.49 E:0.089926 |  and keeping them motivated and keeping everything on track and you know at Christmas time we were
[8901.64 - 8906.12] P:1805.51 E:0.091178 |  talking about then potentially pushing for the Premier League title that fell away pretty quickly
[8906.12 - 8911.16] P:1889.96 E:0.087298 |  but as I say finishing the season strongly to get the Champions League football and winning the
[8911.16 - 8917.96] P:1915.35 E:0.090252 |  trophy managing Chelsea and and all these players and all these young players as well youngest average
[8917.96 - 8922.76] P:1981.63 E:0.089123 |  age in the Premier League is not an easy job and he's had a fair bit of stick of Chelsea fans as
[8922.76 - 8926.84] P:1862.35 E:0.095514 |  well even towards the end of the season we were talking about me about the the performance at
[8926.84 - 8931.96] P:1907.70 E:0.093508 |  Fulham a game they eventually won when he was taking a load of sticks so he can feel well
[8932.04 - 8937.08] P:1893.91 E:0.086770 |  satisfied I think Steve with the job he has done at Chelsea this season. Yeah Mark if you can have a
[8937.08 - 8943.72] P:1831.07 E:0.092315 |  style of football that people don't love you've got to win and Enzo Moresca's won. Yeah they do and I
[8943.72 - 8950.76] P:1824.43 E:0.096238 |  think maybe it's a case of also him learning on the way to maybe be a little bit flexible maybe a
[8950.76 - 8956.68] P:1793.76 E:0.091580 |  little bit of an adaption maybe be a little bit pragmatic sometimes rather than overplay look I
[8956.68 - 8961.96] P:1904.83 E:0.085063 |  think they're not there were times in the game they overplayed a little bit but overall I thought
[8961.96 - 8968.52] P:1852.63 E:0.084406 |  they got the balance pretty well certainly in the second half and I think you know ultimately you're
[8968.52 - 8976.52] P:1933.37 E:0.089041 |  right winning games getting results winning games achieving things winning trophies is what keeps people
[8976.52 - 8982.52] P:1857.25 E:0.094285 |  on side and I think for for the manager it's so important that he keeps doing that and I agree
[8982.52 - 8988.04] P:1975.86 E:0.095001 |  well he's saying I think he managed this squad this club really really well this season for him
[8988.04 - 8991.88] P:1947.46 E:0.083043 |  the reason I think he's got a massive smile on his face is that Champions League tick
[8992.68 - 8996.60] P:1852.28 E:0.101431 |  winning the trophy that he said was the most important and the biggest trove biggest tournament
[8996.60 - 9001.96] P:1889.94 E:0.084169 |  for them this season the confidence done tick so he's done it he's delivered the trophy he's won
[9001.96 - 9006.36] P:1874.47 E:0.085889 |  he's gone into Champions League and everything has sort of fallen into place for him his plan
[9007.00 - 9011.88] P:1377.09 E:0.087028 |  could some things have gone better of course but then overall the grand plan that I think he had
[9011.88 - 9019.16] P:1455.69 E:0.089598 |  has worked final thoughts Pat um Chelsea look stronger Chelsea are getting better Chelsea are
[9019.16 - 9024.92] P:1560.36 E:0.092654 |  becoming more mature and they will strengthen but it will come down to two words for next season I think
[9025.80 - 9031.72] P:1741.97 E:0.083569 |  Cole Palmer getting back to where he was the season before Chelsea will have a cracker
[9032.28 - 9038.44] P:1755.88 E:0.098101 |  all right Pat thank you very much Ali Mark great stuff inside the stadium and that's it now for
[9038.44 - 9045.80] P:1525.66 E:0.088269 |  Chelsea season the players can go and have a good long rest and then in 19 days the club world cup starts
