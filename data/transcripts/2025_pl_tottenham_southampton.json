  "transcript": " Kevin, thank you very much, Indy. Good afternoon. Welcome along to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It has been a season arribilis for both of these football clubs. We could have our first relegation of the campaign confirmed, with Southampton staring into the abyss, whilst Tottenham Hotspur are on course to finish outside of the top ten for the first time in 17 years. As Kelly Slater alongside Stephen Kelly for you on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and Stephen, these two make quite the pair. Yeah, they do. They really do. Tottenham's only hope is that Europa League coming up during the week, Southampton. It's a matter of when, not if, and if it's today, they go down as the earliest team to relegate in Premier League history, which no one will want. It's got the smacking of it. A pre-season friendly here to some extent. Sun is shining. I don't think either fans are enamoured by what they're going to see, but fingers crossed we get a game that's going to be exciting. Yes, fingers crossed it doesn't have pre-season friendly vibes, as Stephen alluded to. We've got one team trying to avoid the worst season in club history, the other trying to avoid the worst season in Premier League history. Those maths very straightforward for Southampton lose, and they will be relegated, doing so, in record breakingly quick fashion. The Saints, they lack in a number of areas, Stephen, but surely with these horrific wooden spoons being waved in their direction, they don't lack in the motivation department. You would think so. It's so interesting because the whole, the cliche, you're playing for pride, you're playing for pride. Listen, I've been there, I've been in that situation before, and they have to show something. You have to show something to your manager, to your fans, that you weren't the place in this team going forward, or if you're in a position where you're going to go play and other teams can look for you, whatever is your motivation, you have to put on the pitch today, and you have to try and get something, and let's face it, it's a time to cook, go and get a result against Spurs at home, because many teams have. Well, a wall of noise has greeted the two teams. The sun is shining in north London. It is a beautiful spring afternoon as the two great underwhelmers in this season's Premier League meet with just eight matches remaining. Southampton fighting to avoid the drop here and now. Spurs fighting to avoid the tag of Worst Tottenham team for a generation. Son Kyung-min led the Tottenham side out, all of them wearing sky blue training jackets over the top of their home kit, matching the sky that hangs over the top of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the Golden Cockerel, which presides above all of it, resplendent in the sunshine, the sun kissing off of its neck. As both teams have made three changes, Spurs are entering a season and potentially tenured defending, defining Fortnite, and Ange-Poster Cogglue has one eye on Thursday's huge Europa League quarterfinal with his team selection. Three changes, Pedro Porro, Ben Davis and Brennan Johnson return for destiny, who doggy Mickey van der Ven and Wilson Odube, all drop into the bench where they find Brazilian forward, Rashalison, the lesser spotted Rashalison. Back from another injury, he's involved in a Premier League squad for the first time in two months. Southampton also make three changes, Flins Downs is suspended after picking up his tenth yellow card of the season. Paul Onowachu fit enough only for the bench after injuring his ankle. Jack Stevens also drops out as the Saints look to be switching to a 4-3-3 formation. Joe Arebo, Cameron Archer and Tyler Dibbling, whose Spurs are reportedly interested in targeting this summer all-star, but Steven clearly Ange-Poster Cogglue, who will come on to in a moment, has got one eye on Thursday night. Oh, you would think he's so focused on this, on the back of his defeat against Chelsea midweek, that they're going to feel like they can win here. If they can't beat Southampton at home, there's something seriously wrong with Spurs. And to go in confidently into the next game, you feel getting a win at home, getting the fans on the cheer about, and then getting the support you need going into Europa League. But the pressure is on this side, and this is not the game that defines the season. It's going to be Thursday. Spurs in their home kit of white and navy blue, Southampton in a pink away strip, pink shirts, pink shorts and white socks. Ange-Poster Cogglue stood patrolling the edge of his technical area far down beneath the set pitch level, with his hands in his pockets wearing a long-sleeved navy blue polo neck and black trousers. He's had a lot to say over the last few days about VAR, about society, and about the relationship with supporters as well. And a good comfortable win here this afternoon would help to bridge that gap ahead of an important fortnight. Yeah, I really would. You feel that they fall apart so much from when he came in first, and there was just this kind of sense of energy, enthusiasm, and the Tottenham playing this sensationally attacking minded football, that the Tottenham fans are all getting behind, and now it feels like they've fallen so far away from that. And the manager, listen, I agree with some of his points with, you know, phones and all this, I think just being present in the moment and all that sort of stuff. But he's losing the track of what's going on, and I think the only thing that can change is results on the pitch. That's the only thing that can get him back on track with the fans. Still a great noise here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Southampton won the toss. They've turned Tottenham around, and so Tottenham will take the kickoff. James Madison is stood over the ball, and Spurs will attack the wall away to our right hand side. It looks to be another complete full house here in North London. Aaron Ramsdale has made his way in front of the wall, and the former Arsenal goalkeeper is greeted in kind, as you would expect. This is Tottenham Hotspur's dedicated no room for racism fixture, and so both teams take the knee, and we are underway. It is Premier League Sunday on BBC Radio 5 Live here on Sports Extra. Spurs start the day 16th, one place lower than their worst ever Premier League finish. The only way is surely up for them. The only way is down, though, for Southampton. The trapdoor is wide open and ready for the Saints to throw themselves through it, relegated today if they lose. Spurs have the ball down the left. Jed Spence right footed outside of his boot finds James Madison, who's in the corner flag area on the far side of the ground, fixed across it twice. The former Spurs player Kyle Walker Peters stays with him, and it's an early Spurs throwing. Yeah, you feel the Spence on the ball for me is being one of Spurs' best players, and he would have been a player that was nowhere near to starting on, but the start of the side was fought his way back into it, and you feel a lot of these players have to really kind of redeem themselves, and you know, they've got eight games to do left in the Premier League, and they've got a few massive fixtures in Europa League, and this is this game you're playing for a place in that game on Thursday. That game on Thursday evening will have updates on BBC Radio 5 Live against Iron Trap Frankfurt. Spurs kicking from left to right in their white and navy blue homestrip as Brennan Johnson looks to sneak in, but the ball might fall to Salanki instead. Inside the penalty area, Downey goes under the challenge of Bednarek. The referee waves it away, and Southampton will try to hammer it clear down the left touchline in the direction of Aribo. Run you through the teams here in a moment as soon as the ball goes there, as Madison picks it up in the heart of the Spurs midfield, squares it in the direction of Spence, and Madison gets it back again. Vicario is in goal for them, a back four of Porro, Romero, Davis, and Spence. The last of those is on the ball right now, edge of the penalty area, left hand touchline, overlap for Madison, who's got far too much space, drills his cross off the backside of Walker Peters, comes back to Spence once more, we've played nearly two minutes, it's goalless as Madison's right footed ball is headed away by Bednarek out as far as Benton Kerr. Benton Kerr is in the middle of a three-man midfield, Bergwald to his right, Madison to his left, up top, Brennan Johnson on the right, Sun Hyeong-min on the left, and Dominic Salanki through the middle. Here is the Spurs skipper, Sun Hyeong-min. Still goalless here in a resplendent Tottenham-Hurtsworth stadium, not a seat to be viewed anywhere inside this ground, a crowd of around 60,000 expected, and they tend to fair pretty well against Southampton, beating them 5-0 on the south coast when the two sides met in December. Benton Kerr is the target of the next ball down the left, just about keeps it in before the byline, and it's back with Sun Hyeong-min, little ball for Bergwald inside the penalty area, cuts it back in the direction of Salanki, turns, hits it, blocked by Bednarek, and then Hammond Clear by Mattias Fernandez. Southampton have just started like a team that completely describes how they've played Saturday season, or have been this far in the Premier League. They look like a team waiting to be beaten, and that's where three minutes in, and every clearance is just a hoof away, they're trying to get rid of their lines, and they're just sitting back so deep. The problem is for Tottenham, it's Tottenham on the counter, can get done, so even though you feel Southampton are really under the coach so far, Tottenham leave themselves exposed, and Southampton will know that. Interesting four-star, first few moments. The boos for Aaron Ramsdell, the Southampton keeper in front of him, they're playing a 4-2-3-1 formation from right to left at the back. Kyle Walker-Peters, who isn't getting such a rude reception here in north London as Walker-Peters returns to the club that he came through at as a child, played 24 times for the first team as Ramsdell's ball runs all the way through to Vicario at the other end. Harwood Bellis and Bednarak in the middle of the defence with Manning at left-fallback in midfield, Ogachukwu and Arebo with Dibbling on the right, Fernandez and Sulamana getting forwards in support of Cameron Archer. Poros on the ball for Spurs, bright pink boots, matching the kits of Southampton, plays a searching ball from right to left, far too far in behind the likes of Solanke and Madison. Four minutes have been played, it's still goalless, it's still all Spurs, and Southampton have got themselves another free kick Kyle Walker-Peters bundled to the ground again, this time by Lucas Bergval. Topman fans will have one eye on Tyler Dibbling, Stephen Kelly, because he's been linked with a move to north London this summer, though the figure that they're talking 100 million pounds. Oh yeah, it's ludicrous. I can't imagine Daniel Levy's going to pay that. No, I would have said you have. If all the teams teams in the league there, you feel may offer substantial place, it's not going to be Tottenham, is it? And he takes a lot of boxes for how Tottenham like to do business. Young player got Premier League experience, someone that can grow loads of energy, exciting, but would they be willing to shadow from after they brought in a good feel like Bergval, Gray, Odebrew, these young players that come into the side and France, they've all done really well. Do you want to add more of that into what is it already young side? They've probably all done really well for young footballers, rather than really well for a footballer that can come in and win now, which is what Tottenham fans are so desperate for. Yeah, that's exactly it. I think fans want something now and don't get me wrong. I think Bergval has been brilliant. I think Gray, when he's played, I think has played some wonderful positions, being played out of position so much as well. That's a good ball forwards from Romero. Good idea anyway. The execution was slightly off. He was looking for Pedro Porro up near the edge of the Southampton penalty area. Spurs recover possession once more near the halfway line. Porro on the ball, wins his side, a throw in directly in front of his manager, Ange Postacoglo. And how will he be feeling this afternoon? After everything that happened at Stamford Bridge on Thursday, the cupping of his ears in the direction of the traveling Tottenham Hotspur fans after they scored that goal that was then disallowed. Ange says there was no malice behind it, but he still did it. Yeah, listen, he's done it. He knows what he's done. I think he can try and downplay it as much as he can. But at that time, his managers would get frustrated. Brennan Johnson, edge of the penalty area down the right wing towards the byline. He's really well held up by Manning and Aribo and Manning try to win the ball back. The latter of those two throws himself to the ground and looks to grab the ball at the same time. Brennan Johnson has made very little contact with him, but it's directly in front of the assistant in the bottom right hand corner. The Southampton left and that will be a free kick. You don't like to see him given, but as a former fallback, former defender, I'm sure you've gone down for a few like that where you wait for a little bit of contacting your back, put yourself between ball and man. You probably couldn't possibly come. It's one of those things you develop on quite early, I think as you start playing, because you realise you're under pressure, you're facing your own goal, you're facing away from play, and what can you do? And as a player on the opposition team, you're like, don't touch him, don't touch him, don't give him that chance to go down. And you go and it's going to be a fail, it's going to give you a bit of a rest, but it go give you that chance to play out from the back. Goal is here, seven minutes on the clock. Goal is as well between Brentford and Chelsea, which is available to listen to on the BBC Sport website and nil nil between Fulham and Liverpool as Arnys Lots side continue to edge ever closer to a Premier League title of the Chukbu, back to Arun Ramsdale in a darker shade of pink, more of a lilac goalkeeping kit with a hint of purple. He'll hear the boos every time he picks it up for his former Arsenal days. Solanke, left wing, ten yards away from the penalty area, he'll find a short ball for Madison, and Madison will find Son Heung-min, plays it back towards Johnson, really good block from Manning, just as Brennan Johnson was about to pull the trigger from eight yards, Manning got himself in the way and it'll be a Tottenham hot spur throwing on the far side instead. It's great builder from Tottenham, Madison with a lovely ball behind the full back Walker Peters, his son comes onto it and he gets his head up, pulls it back into Johnson, but right Manning, the Irish full back comes in really strong, great block from him, Johnson centre of the goal, gets a decent connection on it, but Manning's right there to get that block on. That throwing taken from the far side, all the way back up in the direction of Ben Davis, now the Welshman back into the 11 this afternoon, as I mentioned for Tottenham hot spur, with Charleston back on the bench after his latest injury, as Porro tries to get the other side of Sulamana and does do eventually, does really well, turns, his cross is blocked, it'll be a first, Spurs corner in front of the wall and Pedro Porro shifts his arms up in the air and asks for more noise and more enthusiasm from those Spurs supporters. I always find that funny, yeah, I think you have to give a little bit more to want the fans to give you more. Porro will take the corner kick that he won, a right-footed out-swinging ball deep towards the edge of the six yard box, brilliant save, as Romero's head up went straight at Ramsdale, who bounced backwards as he pushed the ball away from harm's way. And maybe Romero should score, but Aaron Ramsdale makes an excellent save. Wonderful save from Ramsdale, it's point blank, it's straight at him, the ball in from Porro, wonderful corner and Romero appeals off, diving header straight in, but it's just too straight around Ramsdale. The power he generates is fantastic, but the trajectory is just down the line aside of Ramsdale who can punch it away. Excellent diving header, can there be a better site in football than a diving header that's met so meatily, but excellent save as well from Aaron Ramsdale and he's going to have to do it all again perhaps because Lucas Bergval is just won a second corner for Spurs in quick succession, played nearly 10 minutes, it's still 0-0, but it's all Tottenham hot spur, which I guess should come as no surprise, but when you consider that Southampton are playing today to avoid relegation and if they are relegated today will be the quickest Premier League side in history to be relegated, maybe you expect a little bit more as Porro's right-footed out swinger is this time headed up and away by Bednarak and helped on its way towards the halfway line by James Madison. Yeah, it's been a real tough start for Southampton, just stuck in their own half of their pitch, not being able to play out, any balls are trying to clear, just going straight to Tottenham like this and if you're Tottenham you'd be feeling so confident in your press that you can just go after them and win the ball back. Well you mentioned that it might be like a pre-season friendly, it's almost like a training ground exercise as Bergval gets the other side of Johnson and Bergval with his left foot, never really catches hold of it from 10 yards out, it all opened up to him, Aaron Ramsdale was stood waiting to make the save and in the end he could have thrown his proverbial cap on it. You know as he goes in it's lovely, just he's a little shimmy with his body but he can't get the touch with his left foot out to be able to make the contact he wants, it's stuck under his body and he ends up just rolling into the keeper, he just needs to take it away from his body slightly more so he can get more of it, more purchase on it. Tyler Dibbling just got his first touch of any real meaning and it's taken 11 minutes in this game, still goalless, nice ball from Fernandez from the heart of the pitch out to the right wing for Walker Peters and they attack the end where all the Southampton fans are gathered, here is Dibbling now, step into the penalty area, tiptoes towards the back posters across in the direction of Sulamana who really should score but Vicario makes a good point blank save and the danger not cleared yet as Fernandez picks up the ball, he's closed down by Brennan Johnson, back towards Manning, Manning's left footed ball had plenty of time to pick out his cross, it's headed away before it could reach anybody in pink and that was a really good move from South Hampton, curling ball towards the back post, Sulamana perhaps should do better Stephen Kelly. I think it's a great save from Vicario, comes off his foot onto the post and back out but if that doesn't sum Tottenham up in an instant of how their season has been totally dominated the game, loose possession once, one attack from South Hampton and they hit the post. Sulamana on the ball again for South Hampton down the left and now Tottenham Hossborough have gone into their shells somewhat, curling ball into the penalty area, Archer was trying to get there in front of Vicario but the Tottenham Hossborough goalkeeper came out dressed all in yellow and quickly gathered the possession and Spurs will take a breath and look to build again and look to get themselves back on top in this game as Madison finds some space on the halfway line, Son-Hum Min picks it up, approaching the edge of the penalty area, there's the overlap, Jed Spence back to Johnson, what a brilliant goal! Lightning quick from Tottenham Hossborough down the left hand side, all of their stars involved, Brennan Johnson running onto it, 10 yards out and picking out the top corner first time, 13 minutes have been played, it's Tottenham Hossborough 1, South Hampton 0. From start to finish this goal is lizard with quality, Romero's pass into Madison in the space between the lines, Madison's touch finish and playing in the line to Spence and Son, wonderful play and this time Johnson the cutback is perfect and Manny Cantimus tackle and this time Johnson fires into the roof for net with a wonderful left-foot finish who Johnson has probably been Tottenham's most prolific player this season, missed a lot of games and you know in an instance it's changed but what a wonderful end-to-end goal from Spurs, slick passing with a wonderful finish. Well you talked about South Hampton being possibly looking at the counter attack today as their best option but Spurs there from one end to the other, just not a single error, not a pass goes wrong and the finish is just magnificent from Brennan Johnson, his 10th league goal of the season. It is, yeah, a sublime finish and but like I said at the start the pass from Romero out between the lines into Madison, he fended pocket of space, he just whipped it into him which was a great pass, Madison's touch and turn to find Son, excellent as well and then the cross, the head up, the puller back to Johnson but I think this game just screams of two teams who defensively are not confident in what they can do, Tottenham are the same, Tottenham are not confident in how strongly they can be defensive so Hampton are just struggling to do anything to stop the teams playing through the lines. Spurs leading against South Hampton then with 14 minutes on the clock by one goal to nil, Liverpool have just taken the lead at Craven Cottage, McAllister with the opener there. It's a free kick for South Hampton, 10 yards outside of the Spurs penalty area down the left wing, Ryan Manning is stood over the ball, he'll offer a left-footed out swinging cross as the first quarter of an hour is in the books. That ball flicked away towards the back post, Bednarek keeps it alive, now it falls to Archer, low left-footed shot is blocked out to Matias Fernandez, drags his effort goalwards but into the path of Uggachukwut who tried to divert it goalwards but in the end puts it well wide. No, he didn't know much about that as it came in but he wasn't offside, he was in a really good position and because he sees it so late can't direct the back towards goal. Spurs looking to build from the back and there are a few nervy ooze and arse as South Hampton put the press on, tried to play it away down the left but Dibbling intercepts for South Hampton and the Saints have it back, Bednarek, their skipper finds the youngster Dibbling once more. I mentioned Liverpool have taken the lead at Fulham, you can listen to that game on BBC Radio 5 Live in the company of Mark Scott and Clinton Morrison, also in west London, Brentford Nyl, Chelsea Nyl, that one with John Akers and the Colchester United striker Lyle Taylor. Dibbling on the halfway line finds Matthews Fernandez, Uggachukwut, misplaces his pass and puts it out for a throw in on the far touch line level with the halfway line for Angi-Poster Coglou's Tottenham Hotspur. A reminder, as things stand with South Hampton, one goal down, they will be relegated from the Premier League this afternoon, they will do so in record breakingly quick fashion. This is Game Week 31, no Premier League side has ever gone down this early, even the awful Derby team which currently holds the record, although that's on the threat at the moment from South Hampton, didn't get relegated until Game Week 32, they hold that record with Huddersfield Town as Tottenham Hotspur pick up the ball through James Madison, 30 yards from goal, he's fouled by Lesley Uggachukwut, thumps the ground in pain and it'll be a free kick in a dangerous area, it's a long way out but it's not too far out Steven Kelly to have a go at goal. No, my fanciest from this distance, really again, Madison is moving between the lines really around, receives this ball on the half turn, just shifts his body, Uggachukwut sweeps his leg and takes his calf out, but it's a great position for Madison and a lovely pass in, I think it's from Brennan Johnson in the first place, but Tottenham are starting to motor, they're just finding nicely in the middle of the pocket, nice passing lines. What an important couple of moments in the game, South Hampton going up one end and almost scoring in their own right through Cameldean's Sulamana, only for Vicario to make an excellent save, only for Spurs to go up the other end and immediately find a breakthrough. 17 minutes have been played, Spurs won South Hampton nil, that goal coming from Brennan Johnson, his 10th league goal of the season, the first Spurs player to enter double figures, Son Hyung-min turns the ball towards the back post, Benton Koo was the intended target, couldn't quite get on the end of it and Kyle Walker-Peters clears it long and up towards the halfway line. Yeah, but again, Lucas at Hampton when they clear their lines, it's just nobody, the whole team is back in the Fendham, which they probably rightly so, with a free kick, the position it's in, but when they play that ball forward, there's just no pass, there's no line as safe for anybody to find, it's just hopelessly clicked back into the Tottenham team. Bergwald does well, tries to win the ball back off of Manning, who stands strong, just about keeps hold of it, but then immediately concedes possession and it will be another Spurs free kick. As they kick from left to right in front of us, it's about three yards in from the near touch line. Opportunity to throw the slightly bigger men forwards, big men, I mean, there's a, they've got plenty of height in the team, but no giants, there is one giant here today, he's sat on the bench for Southampton, Paul Onowachi who scored two in his last two, picked up an ankle injury in their one all draw against Crystal Palace four days ago, and is only fit enough for a place on the substitutes bench where he'll also find Ross Stewart, another striker, my goodness, he's had his injuries back in a squad for the first time since October, ball curled in, so was the back post, Ramsdale comes out, flies and puts his right fist in the air and pours it away for a Tottenham throwing on the far touch line, around 10 yards up the line from the far corner flag. We're currently advertising here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium that Beyonce's coming in this summer, and I know that some of the Spurs fans were singing outside the ground whether or not could she play up front. They've not struggled to score goals, Spurs, it's kind of more at the other end. Sticker, I don't say, Sticker said they're back and see what happens. That'd be a position you want to see, you know, stop, stop or maybe a holding with field roll. Jay Z at right fallback. James Madison picks it up, gives it to Bergwald, takes a touch away from a couple of Southampton players, goes down referee, plays the advantage. Brennan Johnson has it on the right, low crosses blocked behind for a third Spurs corner of the game, nearly 20 minutes gone, continuing to lead by one goal to nil. I really like Bergwald. He flies into tackles, he puts pressure on teams, so full of energy, and then he's got a little bit of quality as well. But for a young, he's 19 years of age. Spurs fans like him as well. They booed the substitution, of course, on Thursday evening when he was withdrawn and they brought Papsar on. And of course Papsar then scored the goal that led to the cupping of his ears from Angiopasta Coglu as Pedro Porro picks it up and finds Johnson on the right side of the area again. Good header away and behind by Harwood Bellis, joined from Manchester City's Academy. Last summer, £20m he cost after a season-long low in the championship where they won promotion, of course, and will be returning to at the conclusion of this game today, should things stay the same. Fourth corner in the first 21 minutes, Pedro Porro, again the man to take it. Right-footed out-swinger runs all the way through towards Dibbling on the edge of the box. Southampton think about trying to clear the ball away. Dibbling tries to keep a hold of it, goes down in a heap, wants the referee to bail him out and give him a free kick. That might well be handballed, though against Sun Hyunmin, it is, and Southampton will now be bailed out with a free kick. It's interesting, is it? So Sun gets penalised for a ball and smashed against him from Mjärvöe. Dibbling goes down and basically cups the ball with his stomach to stop them getting away because he falls on top of it, and that doesn't get penalised. We keep talking about cups and cupping in the first 21 minutes of the game here. Tottenham still leading on BBC Radio 5, Sports Extra. Angiopasta Coglu, of course, famously now, might even put an in in front of famously, infamously, declaring that he always wins a cup in his second season in charge somewhere, I saw a write-up note down that the only cups that Tottenham Hotspur might be winning at the moment are the, well, the cups around his ears from Thursday evening as Jed Spence picks up the ball approaching the halfway line. They enter, of course, on Thursday evening the Europa League quarterfinals, which their season really now hinges on against Eintracht Frankfurt here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. We'll have updates on that one into live commentary of Lyon against Manchester United in another Europa League quarter final, and following Thursday as Vicarios closed down by Archer. Spurs will travel to Germany for the second leg. Clearance away from Porro, can only find Harwood Bellis wearing a tight black headband to keep his hair in place this afternoon in the North London sunshine. Tyler Dibbling picks it up, has the overlap from Kyle Walker-Peters chooses not to use that, and instead they'll work it back across the defensive line. Joe Aribo will now take over. Southampton have lost five of their last six away games, six matches without a win in total since their 2-1 victory at Ipswich in early February. Nearly 23 minutes on the clock here. Kyle Walker-Peters puts his foot on the ball and tries to find Archer. Nowhere near doing so, and Tottenham Hotspur recover possession again, and we're talking before the game, Stephen Kelly, about the importance of trying to build a little bit of confidence from a Spurs perspective ahead of going into such an important game, like they have on Thursday evening here in the Europa League. Yeah, absolutely. I said to Hampton, being the worst team in the league this season, but there's fundamentals they could put in play today like that, pressing the team at the right time, getting them up to pitch. All that organisation and things that Tottenham have kind of fallen away from, to try and get them back in play in this game with as many players performing to a decent level, then to go into Thursday feeling right, we've got the hang of this. Awkward ball back for Aaron Ramsdale, which is what you could hear, the delighted cheers from the Tottenham Hotspur fans in the wall behind that goal, celebrating the fact that Ramsdale was finding life difficult there for a moment. Still 1-0 to Spurs. That goal coming through. Brennan Johnson in the 13th minute, Bergvale picks it up now, number 15 on his back, bright blonde Disney character like here. That's neat defending at the back from Jan Bednarek, who chests the ball out of harm's way. It's now with Cameldean Sulamane, who gets his pocket picked by Bergvale, but does well to recover the play before Spurs could do any more damage. Fernandez finds a Rebo near the halfway line on the left wing in front of what looks to be a very excited, even Eureich, the Southampton coach. He laughs at the idea that he should stay inside his technical area. I don't think I've ever seen him confined by white lines, marching up and down, constantly clapping and encouraging his players. Fulham have equalised at Craven Cottage, Ryan Cessignon, it's 1-0 there now, Fulham won Liverpool won the games on BBC Radio 5 Live for you here on BBC Radio 5. Sports extra 1-0 to Spurs against Southampton, who I reiterate will be relegated if the scores stay like this at the conclusion of this game. It's Romero who picks it up for Spurs at the back, heart of the defence. One of several key Spurs players that have had their injuries this season, missed three months with a hamstring problem. There is talk that he might be leaving North London in the summer as Madison turns away from Ogachukwu, gets tugged back and that will be a Spurs free kick and a first yellow card of the afternoon. It goes to Leslie Ogachukwu. Yeah, it's the second tour time maybe Madison has received the ball on that back foot. Really good awareness from him looking over his shoulder and then just rolls Ogachukwu, who fells him again. This time it's a little bit too far out to maybe contemplate the shop of Madison. Like I said, his positioning today has been very good. Just as basically he found you, you want to get back to James Madison being that industrial player in the middle of the park, finding spaces, head on a swivel turning, making things happen. And I said that for Tottenham, too many players have been off their game and you want to get them back before this last push. Two brilliant footballers stood over this free kick, which is fully 30 yards. Madison rolls it to Sun, Sun Square across the edge of the penalty area in the direction of Poro, puts the ball onto his left foot, ball to the back post, another diving head up and again brilliantly saved by Arum Ramsdale. It's Ramero once more at the back post, flying through the air, sticks his head on it from around three yards out, albeit at an acute angle. But the Southampton shot stopper, Arum Ramsdale, once more, makes a crucial stop for his side. It is, it's point blank again. Ramero is just all action, isn't he, when he's going through the ball and everything is just so flung. This time really good balling from Poro to the far post and Ramero throws himself out of a diving header all of our two or three yards away from Arum Ramsdale, who point blank save, gets it away and keeps him in it. Well, they talk about using your head as a footballer. Arum Ramsdale has done exactly that. He's saved that, perhaps not so much with his head with his face, which is why he's now lying sprawled on his back. It's a brilliant save because he makes himself big and he pucks his head in harm's way. Didn't know a huge amount about it, but right place, right time Arum Ramsdale keeps the score at just one nil spurs. If you're off the vintage and you're looking for a description of this, it's a full Peter Smeichel spread legs, wide arms, head up and he takes it straight in the face. Again, it's a wonderful header from Arumero, but just point blank straight down the line and if Ram's head is very brave getting out there, doesn't he? What do they call it? The starfish or something like that? Starfish, yeah. So spurs won Southampton nil here on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra for you with Craven Cottage on BBC Radio 5 Live. It's full of one Liverpool one on the BBC Sport website, Brentford nil, Chelsea nil, Stiltsacom, later on 430, the Manchester Derby, United against City, Live on 5 Live, 430, kickoff John Murray and Leon Osmond with you for that one. Of course, match of the day two with you this evening as well. And then tomorrow, the Monday nightclub will return with Mark Chapman, who's joined by Chris Sutton, Rory Smith and Duncan Ferguson. And then we kick off Masters Week, live from Augusta in the United States, ahead of the first golfing major of the year. We've got commentary live from Augusta National across 5 Live, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. That's starting Thursday at eight o'clock and there will be plenty of build up between now and then across the BBC. Aaron Ramsdale's okay, he's back up on his feet again, sore face I'm sure, but okay. And the score, thanks to him and practically nothing else, Stephen Kelly, is still spurs won Southampton nil, Son Humein has been kicked to the ground. There'll be a free kick 10 yards inside of Southampton territory. Yeah, Tottenham just totally dominated this game. It doesn't mean Southampton won't get a chance because even though Tottenham have barely lost possession, you still feel Southampton will get a shot on target somewhere there, which is the crazy scenario you think they're in. But Tottenham have handled it really well, moving the ball well, pressing really high up the pitch, creating a number of chances. Jed Spence has it for spurs just outside of the Southampton penalty area, short ball for Madison, and the Chukro goes across and sees the ball shepherded behind for Southampton goal kick. What a season they have endured Southampton. They are 13 points worse now than they were at the same stage of their last relegation season two years ago. No clean sheet in any of their last 13 matches and statistically speaking, they are the worst home team, the worst away team. They score the fewest goals and they concede the most goals going into this afternoon. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why they are 20th in the Premier League and will be relegated should the stores stay the same. It will be a Southampton free kick in the middle of their own half. It's a fascinating thing, isn't it, to look at both these teams who have got a lot of, I suppose, a lot of criticism for not being able to adapt their styles of play throughout the season. Tottenham were two gung-ho playing games without having the players they needed, the van de Venze or Amaro at the back and they're playing this high line. So, Southampton playing out from the back, particularly trying to pass the ball and giving teams opportunities to press them and lose it. And at what point in the season do you think this needs to change? So, Southampton relegated. Tottenham are about to have one of the worst seasons in the Premier League history. Should it have changed at some point in the season? Should the managers have been able to identify that and then rectify it or at least tweak something to make them more resilient? Half an hour been played. Spurs won Southampton, Neil Glorious, Blue Sky sitting above us here in North London up to my right, the Golden Cockroil, looking resplendent. Directly in front of us is a pale ghostly moon and there's just a couple of aeroplanes making their way over the top of the nation's capital. As Spurs look to try and end the season with something to smile about, the biggest chance of having a grin this year will be what they can do in the Europa League. Eintracht Frankfurt visitors here on Thursday evening. Karl Walker-Peters meanwhile on the ball toiling away in his own corner in the right full back area for Southampton. And he wins a throw-in off of Sun Hyeong-min who loves playing against the Saints, has 21 goal contributions in 18 games against Southampton, 13 goals, 8 assists, that's more goals and more assists than against any other side that he's ever played against. I think only Mo Salah has a higher goal involvement rate against Manchester United in all of current Premier League players as an awkward and harem-scare and ball is sent across the face of the Southampton goal. They will say that it was full of composure and they were able to clear it away down the left-hand side but they still have conceded possession and it's Pedro Porro battling to get the other side of Matias Fernandez. Down he goes, free kick Spurs about four or five yards outside of the Southampton penalty area. It's Rinsome repeat really isn't it Stephen Kelly? It's just mentioned earlier like a training ground exercise. I think Southampton have had one attack and typical two Spurs they nearly scored from it but they've had one attack all game otherwise it's just been attacking. You know this every single time Southampton get the ball and try to play it to the wide areas that are in the middle of park the Tottenham fullbacks are so high and they're on the full foot they're not allowed to turn whereas you look at the Southampton wingers they look lazy they look they're just down they're just down it's very hard to be motivated it's very hard to lift yourself up from what they've experienced all the season so they're just expecting it to come. Down emotionally down literally Pedro Porro right footed crossed towards the back post it forced a Bergvale and Spurs doubled their lead a right footed ball into the penalty area kept alive the likes of Davis and Benton Kern nodded it back across goal it fell to Lucas Bergvale and from around eight or nine yards out first time with his right foot he diverted it across the goal and into the bottom corner of the net it's Tottenham hot spur to Southampton nil. You can tell the Tottenham fans if all the players in the pitch he's one of the ones they would have wanted to score it's a bit fortunate Knox back in doesn't really know much about when it hits his foot and just goes past Ron's down into that far corner but a wonderful ball in from Porro he gets headed back into position from Romero or Davis comes back across and again he just fleek he just sticks his foot out comes off it unfortunately for him ends with the back in that but you can tell that meant a lot to the Spurs fans because he's one that's really they've taken to their heart. Yeah 19 year old sweet that is first Premier League goal he scored against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup in January in that 1-0 win here and he doubles Spurs lead they lead by two goals to nil and I dare say Stephen Kelly this won't be the last time that we use this expression this afternoon it certainly won't be the last time as there is a VAR check going on for a possible offside but if if this goal stands that is a nail in Southampton's coffin. Yeah I as much as I actually want to say you 100% it is a nail in their coffin this is given but this is taught them and this is taught them this season and I as a Spurs fan as the next Spurs player I find it very hard to get my head around the fact that they can't give goals away at the stage so I'm not I'm not counting my chickens before they've hatched yet. It's very very tight it's all about this offside decision whether or not I think Leslie Yogi Chukru and his left foot is playing on a couple of Spurs players at the far post but it's very very tight and let me just glance down to Ang Poste Coglu who had a lot to say about VAR on Thursday evening after their goal at Stamford Bridge was ruled out he said he hates VAR to its very core he told us on BBC Radio 5 Exactly that looks like they're offside if you look at the the reverse angle I don't know where that's sped up and further ahead but an angle has just come up on the monitors for us and if that's the angle they're going off the Tottenham players looks offside. It's Romero isn't it who's kind of leaning forwards and then there's also Ben Davis at the back post who's also leaning but sticking his left arm out. Is this not if it's not clear and obvious the goal stands why why is this why are we having this debate if they can't decide in the first 20 seconds he's offside then he's offside. Well to to that end I thought this exactly as the goal went in so I checked the exact time that the goal went in and that is now two and a half minutes ago now the the check at Stamford Bridge took six minutes the other night. But like the thought of some guy in it in an office somewhere in a room trying to get a line out on protractor to try and see who the angles and see what's going on it's just ludicrous if you can't see it straight away what on field decisions should count. This is the last round of fixtures in the Premier League where semi-automatic off sides are not involved they will be introduced in time for game week 32 and the idea of the semi-automated offside is that it it's not going to make anything more accurate because they've been 100% accurate all season long but it is expected to cut the time down that a decision takes massively. But if you can't see it instantly then it's crazy like we have microphones here and we're commenting I want a boo as well. There are plenty of boo's you might as well join in as everywhere we look around us we're all shaking our heads it's an incredibly tight decision with several players it's all about Leslie Ogachukwu's left foot and whether or not Davis and Romero are leaning past that line that Ogachukwu is creating. So the angle we have now I'm saying they're on side but if you reverse the angle they look well off they look off so which one are they going on and how this is crazy absolutely nonsensical. It's been four minutes now if it takes this long. And Shpasta Koglu hands in his pockets he now takes them out and crosses his arms and even from all the way up here I could see that he puffs out his cheeks. How much would you love it if you cup this ear? Just like his mouth. He's smiling he's now covering his eyes he's covering his watch so that he's not counting. He's doing rock, paper, scissors as if this is what's going to make the decision. Look at him he's actually comical. He is quite literally doing rock, paper, scissors with himself. Here comes the decision. No roll. The referee this afternoon Michael Salisbury has drawn the imaginary TV line and discounted the goal. Four offside it took over five minutes just three days after Tottenham had a goal ruled out at Stanford Bridge which took six minutes. This one's taken five. It's ridiculous. We shouldn't be like Vars should be better for the league. Vars should cut out all these silly instances but if something is that tight then why does the unfair they should have a I'd love to see a countdown clock in the Vars studio just ticking away. Sweepy just the forehead and then after 20 seconds OK the next two games. I'm going to watch in later and say so, And what do you think about V AR? Good luck to you, Henry. Yeah, I think I'd like to be present for that. Just to see what happens on this about later on BBC sounds. It's crazy. You know, actually, what the funny thing about the Chelsea game for me is that after all the bar decisions after all these eight times. And post a code that didn't have the know how not to celebrate a var go until the end of the season. And then we have the BBC Radio five live where there's a long ball over the top. Archer challenges for it. Vicario comes out and grabs it at the second or third attempt. Liverpool had led full and by one goal to know. But by what while we were discussing the virtues of VAR here, Fullham have turned it around. They've scored a second and a third. It's now full and three. Liverpool one no wonder. Arnie slot. The Liverpool manager has been talking about how the BBC Radio five live and they have been trying to secure it from their remaining eight games of which their trip to West London today is their eighth game to the end. And they've got the work cut out for them. As I say, you can hear it all on BBC Radio five live and then later on today at 4 30. We take you to the Northwest. The Manchester Derby at Old Trafford. It's United against City John Murray and Leon Osmond there for that one. And I thoroughly look forward to watching match of the game. We're going to have a little bit of a break here. We have seen here this afternoon in North London just to reiterate then as we go into the final five minutes of the first half, it spurs one South Hampton. Yeah, it just see it. It's such a bug bear, isn't it? Every game we seem to have a conversation about how long it takes or why it takes along whereas it's I think it's very simple remedy. If it gets to a certain time, then the on feel if it's that unclear, then it's that clear. It's like a wide boy. You know, two fifths of a centimeter. Who knows? But it's crazy that's taken this long. The moon has. Come up more above the North London Stadium in the amount of time that it took for VAR to make their mind up over at Stockley Park. The VAR today's Graham Scott mentioned the man in the middle is Michael Salisbury assistant VAR Natalie Aspernell Spurs have the ball back to the left. He's got the ball down the right wing, right footed cross, headed up, but not away. Falls towards the edge of the box. Down goes Salanke. It drops instead towards Brennan Johnson who pokes it home, but immediately glances at the assistant referee who keeps his flag down and any celebrations are muted. And Shposter Coglou turned. Look to his coaching staff. He's smiling, but also purposefully not celebrating the victory. He's got the ball back to the left wing. And Spurs to Southampton Nill again. Stephen Kelly again. I was watching Johnson's run then Johnson's run looks like he's on side. He sneaks in refer the defending from South Hampton is abysmal. It's absolutely dreadful. They are so poor defensively. They switch off. They give fells away. They don't track their runners. The ball is bouncing around. First of all, it's Salanke gets his body in the way. Then Madison Johnson just kind of just creeps in between the defenders and taps it in. It's so easy. It is so easy for Tottenham. This one will stand. I get a great little finish. It's not just a little touches. It's so calm and collected from Johnson to get a second goal. And but honestly, I'm watching Southampton and they are devoid of any defensive solidness that you'd expect from any team in the Premier League. They are a team hurtling towards their second relegation in three seasons down as things stand. If they lose here today and they are doing in some style, they will be relegated. Two and a half minutes remain at the end of the first half. It is now spurs to South Hampton, Neil, and we can say that with certainty. And as I glance down to my left hand side, which is where you'll find the traveling Southampton supporters, many of them are shielding their eyes, not just because the sun is in their vision today, but also because the football that they are having to be subjected to again this season is worthy of covering your eyes for. Yeah, you feel sorry for them. Listen, they've come out in the numbers again. They've probably wanted to come to this. There's wonderful arena, which, you know, at times can produce moments of wonderful games because they taught them play because they're open and it's an experience to come to this stadium. But you're not coming for the experience of watching their team because they don't give them anything at the moment. They don't give them anything to celebrate. Well, spurs have the ball at the back with the cario. As we approach the 44th minute here in North London, Sunkins continues to shine as Davis plays a long searching ball down that far left touch line in the direction of Jed spent spurs leading by two goals to nil Fulham still leading against Liverpool by three goals to one and it remains goalless at Brentford as they welcome Chelsea this afternoon. Ramsdale caught near his goal line ball back to him that he didn't want. Now it's with Manning Southampton shuffle the ball forwards down the left touch line. Romero gets caught by Cameldean Sulamana, but Cross comes bent and cur and sweeps up in behind with a strong sliding tackle and Ramsdale has it back once more inside his penalty area. He shows composure. He's got the wall of Tottenham fans behind him and they're taking great joy in teasing him. But to be fair to Aaron Ramsdale who's conceded two goals could have been three goals if it weren't for the VAR. It would have been a huge amount worse if it weren't for the former Arsenal keeper. The pass he's just made the title of the league all of what seven yards is probably the best pass to set Hampton players made the whole game. He's fired a true loads of bodies low trajectory straight to his feet and Dibbling was shown for in a really good position and gets them up the pitch. They show good fight against Crystal Palace the other day as Sulamana steps between a couple of spurs players and throws himself into the penalty area goes to ground and no real look in the direction of the referee at the moment. But certainly seem to hurt his knee as he did hit the deck. He now slowly gets back up again as we see just the seven minutes added on at the end of the first half. Steven Kelly I wonder why we've got so much madness isn't it? Absolutely madness that the players are standing around for seven minutes during a game. Six minutes in the first half. Yeah Sulamana left side of the spurs penalty area dressed in pink. He gives it to Manning who offers the overlap lifts it into the six yard box and it lands delicately into the gloves of Vicario in the spurs goal and so far so good for Ranch Poster Cogluy needed an afternoon where they looked good in the sun and they are doing so far albeit against the South Hampton side that are so so poor. Yeah they haven't put a much of a fight. They just Madison gets pickpocketed here just in the edge of the box. First time he's come really deep to receive it and this time not aware of who's behind them, but I think what I'd like to see from spurs now is to keep it up. Don't let off. Don't let them come back into it. I'm really trying to hone themselves and for South Hampton, do they have a fight? Can they show something about themselves that they're, listen, they're down, they're relegated. But what can you do? What can you prove as a player to show you have more about you than what you've shown so far in the season? Dibbling has the ball for South Hampton, square across the middle of the midfield inside the spurs half for a Rebo and now out to Sulamana on the left wing in one of the only shaded areas of this half on this near touch line as South Hampton continue to kick from right to left inside first half stoppage time, seven minutes of it. We played just over 90 seconds of that at the moment as Walker Peters picks it up once more on the right wing bathed in sunshine on that far side, which is where all of the South Hampton supporters are gathered. Ball into the penalty area comes off Madison back to Dibbling forced outside of the 18 yard box with a Rebo 20 yards away now from the penalty area to Manning and now down the left wing for Sulamana onto his right foot curling ball towards the back post about three or four yards in front of the sliding Tyler Dibbling who was trying to keep it in trying to turn it go woods but was never going to get there and it's a goal kick instead. It's a decent ball from Sulamana. It just drops the shoulders, come on, it's a good ball from the left side and just float one into the far post. Vicario can come for it because the pace on the ball but Dibbling gets caught edge of the box and he can't really get himself around to try and make contact with it. Just watching some images flashing up of Angi Poster Cogglio on the monitors here in the press box where he's doing that rock paper scissors, which he felt was probably the way that the AR decided that their second goal, which didn't count, was to be ruled out for offside and he was showing images of how he was playing the ball and the image of the offside call and how tight it was and how it was ruled out for a hand of Davis and a shoulder of Romero. Here comes Spurs again. Son Heung-Min left side of the penalty area near the corner of it goes to find Spence who might well be offside. He is, it'll be a free kick for South Hampton should they choose to take it but the referee instead will play an advantage as they play their way out. It's Mattias Fernandez dead center of the Saints half. Three minutes of seven added on have been played. Spurs still leading by two goals to nil approaching half time at Craven Cottage. It's fallen three Liverpool one and nil nil between Brentford and Chelsea. That one available to listen to on the BBC Sport website. The action from Craven Cottage is on BBC Radio 5 Live. Dibbling has it inside the center circle. Nothing else. He is playing to get a move, I would think, in the remaining seven games after today for South Hampton. Possibly to here, he's been linked with here, possibly to Manchester City as well as Spurs recover possession through the game. He's been playing the game for the past five years. He's been playing the same game as he did in the last game against the Peadro Porro. It does kind of remind me of Jack Greenish actually how he plays not just the low socks. That's not just the low socks. It just his movement. It comes off the line. He draws players in kind of sucks you in the feel like you can get a touch on it, but then manipulates the ball to get away from you. But as such as have been fewer far between this afternoon because they just haven't had any possession. Well, you mentioned and I thought it before you said it. Aaron Ramstell's ball out about five minutes ago and he's the goalkeeper. He's the goalkeeper and you know, he wasn't trying to play it square. I played short. He played it, you know, from inside his box who are 10 15 yards inside to talk them half of the pitch. Dibbling was in a great position. That was a great pass from Howard Bellister. Far better. Maybe we've taught them into it. Mattias Fernandez now dinks a delightful ball out in the direction of Dibbling on the right wing controls it with his chest. He's fronted off immediately by Spence and Son and looks like an island until he finds Walker Peters back to a Rebo 25 yards out from goal. Mattias Fernandez opens up for him. Nobody's closing him down and so it is right foot. He hits it from around 23 yards, but it bubbles in the direction of the cario who makes a very comfortable save. Yeah, very just spaces opens up from gets a decent clean contact on a bit of bouncing from the vicario. Dibbling was in a really good position on the edge of the box. Spencer's dropped inside and kind of got drawn towards the ball and Dibbling had just pulled off a shoulder. We had a release them there. He was taking them on behind Spence driving towards the Tottenham goal and that would have been a really good position for Seth Hampton to be in. Spurs have it again looking for a counter attack down the left, which is where they got their first goal from two goals have been scored both by Brennan Johnson. Bergvall also thought he'd scored, but that was disallowed by VAR of which we've labored plenty over Johnson attempts to find Bergvall with a lofted ball down the Spurs right as Son Joong Min goes down under the challenge of Manning and Manning throws himself to the floor under the slightest touch from Johnson and that'll be a free kick for Southampton. Even Eurich challenged his players before this game to avoid being the worst Premier League team ever. They have 10 points at the moment. 11 is the mark from Derby County coming on for 20 years ago now. Paul Jules said that's something that he was the manager at the time, still follows him around to this day. Derby fans in the East Midlands will certainly not be cheering for Southampton because it's a moniker that they're desperate to share as well, but it comes to something, doesn't it? When a manager is saying, just try to avoid being the worst team ever. You're clutching us straws, aren't you? That's the team that's trying to motivate you. I played against at Derby side and they were poor. They were really poor side, but is it worse the points or getting relegated earlier in the season? I'm not, this is the pointing stand. Spencer's robbed, dibbling on the edge of his own penalty area, right footed shot, beaten away by Aaron Ramstale, only as far as Bergwald, Porro and he can try to concede possession and then look to win it back, but in doing so give Southampton a free kick on this near touchline 20 yards inside of their own heart. No, Ram's that's it. That's a wonderful save. Spence gets in behind the fall back, takes it, opens his body, you have closer whipping in that far corner and Ram's that a full stretch left hand palms in a way and a tartot number definitely going to get us heard. Brennan Johnson has two goals. Southampton are two nil down. And we are approaching the end of the seven additional minutes and there they go. The referee blows for half time. All applause here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and despite the fact that Tottenham lead by two goals to nail and both of them have been scored by Brennan Johnson. I think Stephen Kelly, you could make a very good claim for saying that Aaron Ramstale might be the man of the match so far. Oh, he is. Yeah, best pass to the match. Two great saves. Toured one just there by Spence. He's kept Southampton in it, but they're going to lose but it looks like they're going to lose this match. They're going to have to put in a huge performance the second half to try and get back into it. And Ram's there as as don't want what's been asked from me. Couldn't have done anything with the first with the two goals and when the moments of Comey's made some big saves as things stand, Southampton will be relegated this afternoon. They will be if they lose. They are two nil down. They have another 45 minutes to ensure that they don't set a new record for the fastest relegation in Premier League history. Spurs leading by two goals to nil here, full and leading by three goals to one at Craven Cottage against Liverpool at halftime. It's goalless between Brentford and Chelsea. We will be back for second half commentary shortly here on five sports extra, but during halftime we can get news from the rest of the day's action with five loss against the country. Police in Lincolnshire have named a father and daughter who were killed in a fire at a caravan park in Englebone, 48 year old Lee Baker and his 10 year old daughter Esmeia from the Nottingham area. Two 16 year old boys have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a boyage 17 was stabbed to death in West London. Police have named him as Kieran Charles. They dine at the scene in Shepards Bush. And a 25 year old man has been arrested over a large wildfire in County Dine. More than 100 firefighters worked through the night in the Moore Mountains to try to bring it under control. We're Liverpool and Liverpool's eyes. I'm BBC Eye Player. I forget what you've got at home in our supply lines. I'll have every flavour of mafia. Brand new drama. There's life gods. Life's good with you. Why don't we just walk away? You and me. Even if I walk away I'm still a target. Hmm, the good life. This city is ours. This will end I swear. Watch on BBC Eye Player. This is Five Lives Sports with Steve Crossman. Listen, on BBC Sounds. So, halftime scores in the Premier League. Second half commentary here on Five Live on the way. Fulham 3, Liverpool 1. You'll be able to listen to Tottenham 2, South Hampton 0. That's the halftime score on Five Sports Extra when it gets back underway on the BBC Sport website. Brentford 0, Chelsea 0 is the halftime score. Sail away to defending champions Toulouse in the last 16 of the champions cooked today. Kicks off at 3 o'clock. Adam Whitty. This perhaps the big biggest challenge in club rugby for sale as they aim to pull off what would be a remarkable shock in the South of France to reach their fourth Champions Cup quarterfinal. There's no Antoine Dupont for the six-time winners who for comparison are aiming for their 24th last eight match and they're stacked with international giants like Marseille, Ramos and Capozzo. The hosts have won eight of their last nine. They won all four of their pool stage games. But Alexander Sincere will have a lot of talent themselves. They welcome back Ben Curry is one of five changes from last week's Premiership win against Northampton with England international's George Ford, Tom Roebuck and Asher Apokoufoul-Gior named in a full strength sharks. It would perhaps be the biggest shock in European club rugby history if they were to win at the stadium to lose. But you never know. Kick off at 3. You never know. It would be a big shock if St. Johnson stayed up in the Scottish Premiership this season. However, their gap to Dundee second bottom is now just five points. I say just. They have a 1-0 victory, St. Johnson this afternoon over Celtic, the champions elect. Let's hear from the St. Johnson boss, Seymour Valacari speaking to Gavin Wallace. We needed this to see the best of where we are. So we needed this. We needed this performance after the last weekend. You know, we didn't perform against heaps. So yeah, very, very proud of our players. I think the question is where has that Johnston team been this season? But since you've come in, things have changed a lot. Have you, did you see something like this coming? Did you have confidence that you were going to get a big result at some point? That's a thing, you know, because the results they have not been as we have been wanting. So as a manager, it's very difficult to come outside and see, I see what we are doing. I see that the boys have it. It's just a matter of time it will come out there because the results are not coming because you will be charged what's happening on the field. We are not going, but I have knew that all the time that we have that, the boys have that. And you know, I've said many times, I've been waiting this moment that comes to the game. We scored two, three, four goals, you know, but today, okay, it was a different day. It was a defending, defending display. We needed heroics from our goalkeeper, what a save. Everyone defended, followed the plan, worked for each other. And then this is possible. Simo Valacari, the head coach of St Johnston Live, score you from the Scottish Premiership is Hearts, Nill, Dundee United, Nill and F1 Red Bulls Max Verstappen has won the Japanese Grand Prix. Lando Norris was second for McLaren ahead of his teammate Oscar Piastri. So Norris leads Verstappen by one point in the drivers championship. Let's hear from the Dutchman. Here he is. On the road, of course, is great, but very different scenarios compared to, I would say, the last few years here, you know, today was key to start first. They were trying to get into my DRS, but it's very hard to follow around here. I think also the track them today helped us. Less overheating from the tyres naturally when the track is cooler. And yeah, just incredibly happy with this result. Touched on it there. Can you take us into the cockpit? I mean, how much pressure were you feeling from the McLaren's behind? And we did also see that moment exiting the pits. Could we just get your take on that as well? I was quite calm. I mean, I've been in this position before, but I just trying to focus on my own laps, trying to not make any mistakes, making sure that the balance was drivable, because of course, throughout the entire life, you know, it definitely changes the balance a bit front to rear. But yeah, we managed everything really well. And yeah, of course, she's very happy with this result. And then of course, that bit lane thing. Yeah, I mean, it was tight. That's Max Verstappen. We are live from inside Old Trafford. Full commentary this afternoon. Half past four of the Manchester Derby absolutely bathed in sunshine. I think I said the last time I was here ahead of the Arsenal game, you could really feel that spring was springing because for the first time you could sort of see the big coats had gone away this afternoon for a lot of Manchester United fans that we can see around us already inside Old Trafford. It's very much T shirt weather. So much going on. Fans protest that we're expecting more of from Manchester United supporters this afternoon and happy at ticket prices. The last Manchester Derby for Kevin DeBrunner as well. Correspondent John Murray is with us. There's a lot going on today. Good afternoon, John. Good afternoon, Steve. Yes, there is. But one thing that's not going on is that I think over many, many years now, if these two Manchester clubs had met either here or in the other stadium at this time of year, when the weather's like this, either one or other or actually even both would have had a say in the title race. But clearly that's not the case this time. But you're absolutely right. There's still plenty to hold the interest. So the protest, we were here, what, 20 days ago when it was fans marching outside and you could actually smell from inside the commentary position the cordite from the flares. This is almost the opposite. It's a city. Yeah, another it's another match here and another protest. And if you remember back to then it was in the aftermath of that that Sir Jim Radcliffe gave his big round of media interviews. Excellent view with Dan Rowan, which I suspect is still on BBC Sounds and any Manchester United fan who hasn't heard that, I'd have a listen to that because it's very interesting. And then of course they announced the new stadium as well, the plans for the new stadium. However, things are still rumbling on that are really upsetting hardcore Manchester United fans. So it's the 1958 group that have organized what they intend to be a sit in today. And you're absolutely right. Ticket prices are one of the things that they are taking issue with. You know there's obviously they're taking huge issue with the ownership of Manchester United and the decisions that are being made. But yeah, ticket prices rises without consultation. The prices for OAPs or those concessions. Also this this matter of they say 500 fans are going to be moved from next season. Fans who've sat together for decades because there's going to be a sort of tunnel club style situation that we've seen in quite a number of other football grounds. Manchester City, for example, Brighton as well. And they say the 1958 group quotes football is more than just being a number on a seat where fans can be replaced by more lucrative customers. So we will have if this goes to plan a sit in inside Old Trafford and rather as at Tottenham a few weeks ago, it'll be a case of just saying what the effect of that is and how many people get involved. Leon Osmond is with us for commentary this afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Steve. Every time that we watch Manchester City in person now could well be the last time that we watch Kevin DeBrona, which I just think from a neutrals perspective is actually quite sad. Yeah, I mean, I make a similar feeling to how I felt when that David Silver was leaving Manchester City and what a wonderful servant. He'd be one of my favourite all time players to play in the Premier League and knowing that each time you see him could be the last. It's sad in a sense that, you know, we're no longer going to see those moments of magic from an outstanding player, but it does make you appreciate what they've done. It does make you look back at some of their special moments, what they've achieved, what they've been a part of, why they've made the Premier League so special. And yeah, I hope that those players get the appreciation, it's Kevin DeBrona at the moment, that they deserve from away supporters, not just the City fans who are going to enjoy him, but away supporters. I doubt he'll get that kind of that kind of sense of where you're going. I've got to be honest, I doubt he'll get that here, but he'll be, you know, to take part in these big fixtures, these local rivalries. You want to make sure that every one of every time you're out there, this from Kevin DeBrona that he puts on a show and I'm hoping we're all going to be able to see him do that. Yeah, I'm just watching another one down there on the side of the pitch at the moment, who's one of the best midfielders that has graced this game over the course of recent decades. Brian Robson's down there, totally different player to Kevin DeBrona, but certainly deserves to be in the conversation when people are talking about the best midfielders that have graced the English top flight. But yeah, for Kevin De Brona, I thought she had given earlier in the programme, was spot on when he called him the ace in the pack, or the diamond in the pack, I think he called it. Right, we've got much more build up to come. Clearly we'll talk more about Kevin DeBrona and his team, but I think we'll have to talk about the team. We've got a lot of questions coming up to come. Clearly we'll talk more about Kevin DeBrona and Manchester United as well. Beautiful day here inside Old Trafford, but we've got three full commentaries that you can listen to right now. Spurs Southampton Spurs leading 205 Sports Extra BBC Sport Wedgspike Brentford Nail Chelsea Nail here on five live. Quite a story brewing. Fulham three Liverpool one Clinton Morrison's with Mark Scott. Thanks very much, Steve. Yet perfect timing just about good for the team. The team is still in the lead. They're trailing by three goals to one. No changes from either manager during the interval. So I'll run you through the team short years. Van Dyke heaves the long ball upfield to suboslize underneath it in center field for Liverpool and now Jones wins it back high up the pitch for Liverpool, but Bassie's got it and full and work it back to the left back area and Robinson Bassie up the line into Rodrigo Munoz who scored an absolute belter to Nearsham. Chelsea Nail obviously won at 10 30 to see that goal and all of the others from today's Premier League action. He needs to be better though. Salah in the second half. He's not working nowhere near as hard as he was doing previously. And I've seen it. Not saying I've seen him down tools, but it has to look like common. I know you think it might be over. Not at Liverpool. I'm not talking about him at Liverpool. I mean the Premier League, but he needs to work harder for his team. And that is the world class players. When you see my having the downtime, you need your world class players to step up. Sasha Lucas just picked for Trakinback, Kravenberg, midway inside the Fulham half. So that's the first yellow of the game, and McAllister is over the free kick for Liverpool. The shadows just start to grow across the far side of the pitch to us, underneath that imposing Riverside stand. McAllister lifts it in, but it's catching practice for Burt Lano, so he can run you through the teams now. Lano in goal for Fulham, Robinson, Basi Anderson and Kastania, the back four, Lukic and Berger in midfield with a Wobie, Pereira and Sessignon behind Muniz up top. Liverpool with Kelaher in goal, Robinson, who had a shocker for one of the Fulham goals, Van Dyke, Kanate and Jones there back four. McAllister has scored a belter to put Liverpool in front with Subosla and Kravenberg, the midfield three, Gakpo Jota, and a pretty quiet most, Salah, are there front three. Flipped on by a Wobie for Fulham, midway inside, Liverpool territory, but Liverpool have enough bodies, Batlett are clear up towards halfway. Good turn by Salah Berger inside the centre-circle, to wriggle clear of a couple of Liverpool players, and now it's with Kastania, the Belgian right back, who plays it into the feet of Sessignon, who took his goal very nicely indeed, three goals in his last five league games for Ryan Sessignon, as Lano launches it into the sunshine up towards halfway. Another nice touch from Muniz to get away from Van Dyke. He's laid it off this time for Sander Berger, who brings it over the halfway line into the feet of Sasha Lukic, and Lukic can play it short to Basi, and Basi under pressure can work a dyag pass in towards the feet of him. Wobie, who's challenged by Canate, it was a lunging tackle, but fair, and now Salah's picked up the ball after a mistake from Basi. Most Salah motoring, Trash of Flick and through for Jota! Who can't take the chocks. Kurt Lano with a sprawling save to deny Diogo Jota, who we've got used to being so deadly from that kind of situation, but the Germans spread himself well to keep it at 3-1. Yeah, that's better from Salah. Basi makes a mistake, and Salah plays a clever little ball through to Jota, and he should be scoring Jota. Said earlier in the programme, he's the best finisher at Liverpool, but credit to Bert Lano, he stands up ever so well, but he just couldn't get the ball out of his feet. He's unlucky to be fair, it's a good save from Lano. He hasn't got a great record against Liverpool, Bert Lano. He's not one against him, conceded 28 goals in his 12 games against him, but kept that one out and now gets a fist to this corner, which clears it as far as Mohs Salah. Down by the corner flag on the right side, there's Liverpool look at things, he will let the ball dribble out for a throw to Arna Slott's men, and Salah thinks about taking it himself. Welcome back to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Two teams known for the marching, are heading in decidedly different directions. It spurs to Southampton Neal at the break, and we are about to get back on the way here in north London. Southampton kicking from left to right, get us going again in a kit of pink and white. I'll put my teeth back in again, Stephen Kelly, as spurs kick in from right to left in white and navy blue. Leading by two goals to Neal, Southampton will be relegated in the next 45 minutes or so, if they can't turn this around, and there is no reason to believe that they will be able to turn this around at this stage of the season. No, not from that foreside showing, not from the way Tottenham have played. You feel it's very much that they're going to get relegated today. I'd love to see a better showing from them, I'd love to see a team that has a bit of fight, but they look like they're dejected. The confidence is so low as a squad, and yeah, you feel it's just inevitable today. Two Brennan Johnson goals. The difference in the first half, Lucas Bergwald also scored, but that was ruled out after a VAR check that lasted more than five minutes, ruled out for offside. As I mentioned, Southampton in the kit of pink shirts and shorts, pink shirts and socks and white shorts, Tottenham in their home kit of white and navy blue. They line up with Vicario in goal, no changes at halftime. Porro, Romero, Davis and Spence at the back in midfield. Bergwald, Bentoncourt and Madison up top, Johnson, Solanke and Sun Xiong Min. Kyle Walker-Peters on the ball for Southampton, goes down, looks to have hurt himself. Referee, I don't think was going to give a free kick, but has now taken sympathy with the Southampton player, the former Tottenham Academy product, who's being helped up by Bentoncourt, and it will be a free kick to the Saints, around five yards or so inside Tottenham territory, no changes either for the Saints. Ramsdale in goal, who's kept them in it, if they are in fact in it anyway with the score being 2-0, it would have been five if it weren't for some brilliant stops from Aaron Ramsdale. Back four of Walker-Peters, Harwood-Bellis, Bednarek and Manning. In midfield, Ugarchukwu and Arebo playing slightly further forwards on the right, dibbling the left Sulamana with Matias Fernandez in behind Cameron Archer. This free kick to be taken by Fernandez, launched long up towards the edge of the Spurs penalty area. Ugarchukwu got the telling touch, but it lands at the feet of Bentoncourt, who smashes it off of Bednarek, in fact, might be Harwood-Bellis, and it's a goal kick that's been taken quickly by Vakariam. It's weird, you know when Vakariam takes those quick free kicks from the back, Tottenham wearing set against a better side, which I watched here a few times, they've just got pressed and they've lost the ball to the Tampton here, but Tottenham are not set to play that. The team aren't in position, they're midfield, they're in position, and they've just given Southampton an opportunity to go and press them, and they've done it, they've won the ball back. Sulamana finds Manning, header away from the resulting cross by Romero, up in the direction of Solanke, who tries to flick it in to his path, but it's broken up once more, and this is the most that Southampton have been inside Tottenham territory all afternoon. And it resulted from Vakariam putting the ball down, applying a quick free kick in his own box to a player who's not even really looking at the ball in Ben Davies, and the midfield are set, they're running with their back away, facing away from play, Solanke hasn't got himself in the position, so with them and the trade, the play does pass us. Sulamana's done really well to get the other side of Pedro Porro for a moment, cut into the penalty area, but the Spurs defenders descended upon him, blocked his cross, and then smashed it clear up in the direction of Solanke, up near the halfway line, and Southampton have it back again, and it's just a bit eerily quiet here inside this giant arena, a wonderful place to watch football on a beautiful afternoon like this. There's not a cloud in the sky hanging over the top of the Tottenham-Hottensperre stadium, but at the moment with fan skills slowly making their way back in from the T-bars, if they have them in such a nice place, and Spurs really struggling out the traps to start this second half, it's a place devoid of atmosphere at the moment, and Southampton win their first corner kick of the afternoon. Well, there's a real sense of complacency about this Tottenham side, the way they've come out the second half. You know, they should be coming out revved up, knowing what they have coming on Thursday, and wanting to finish this game off on a high, finish it off strongly, and put the sore to Southampton side who are devoid of any confidence, but Southampton have started better. They'll have needed to as well, even Eurich will have surely said that to his charges at halftime, that they need to start this second half well, as the ball is curled into the penalty area, and Vicario comes and flies, dressed top to toe, in bright yellow, and makes a good claim of the ball. You don't see keepers do that that often. Nowadays, they tend to want to punch those away, but that was a really good claim from the Italian number one. Yeah, it is. And Vicario, who has had a lot of criticism throughout the season, for being not as physical as he should be, or as dominant in his box as you expect your goalkeeper, and from a defender's point of view, or what's horn. Yeah, Rebo's left Romero for dead. These two yards outside of the penalty area pulls the trigger, it's blocked by Bentonker, and deflects into the path of Romero, and now Spurs will perhaps think of counter-attacking in their own right. They won't do, put the foot on the ball, five minutes played of this second half, of which Spurs are really yet to start it, and Spence will find Sun on the left wing, Sun cutting in, looking for Madison, really poor ball from the Spurs skipper. So it's 2-0 to Tottenham here, still 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool in West London, as it is also goal-less between Brentford and Chelsea. You can listen to the last of those three games I mentioned on the BBC Sport website. Fulham Liverpool is on BBC Radio 5 Live. We're available for you throughout the remainder of this game on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, and it'll be a Southampton throwing. Stephen Kelly, you've been through this, you've been relegated from the Premier League, we won't linger on it for obvious reasons. Cheers, Charlie, cheers. You're very welcome. What are these Southampton players going through on an afternoon like this? Well, fortunately, I've not been relegated this early on, or in this sort of state where your 10 points in, I've been in fights till the end of the season and gone down on the last day, which was really tough to take. But you are alone, confidence. You're trying to find the way to win, you're trying to find the way. You know, when you go on a run of a losing streak, or you feel that you just don't have enough in the tank, what can motivate you, what gets you for these games? And it has to be something internally that makes you want to turn up, that makes you want to prove how good you are, prove that you deserve to be at this level. Even Eurich says that their whole motivation is to not go down as the worst team ever. Odd motivation, as that might well be, but if it works, it works at the moment, it's not doing. Though they've started this second half really well, Manning does well to keep the ball in and finds a Rebo, turns it up the left touch line as Southampton kick from left to right in front of us, they attack the end, which is backed by that giant Spurs wall. One huge stand behind the goal that Vicario is defending. Spence wins it back for Spurs with the help of Bergwald. Unlucky enough to get a goal in the first half, Bergwald he thought he'd scored, but five and a half minutes later a VAR check ruled it out for offside. Romero, judge to have just been off. And as Solanke can't hold the ball up and keep Harwood Bellis off his back and the Saints have it again. With Manning down the left wing, looks for an option and looks for a bit of support and finds it in a Rebo. Square across the middle of the Tottenham half to Uggachukwu now with Walker Peters and out to the right wing for Tyler Dibbling. Being watched closely by Spence, he's tricky with those low slung socks. And Walker Peters attempts to find Fernandez, but it's well cut out by the Spurs defence. They have it back with James Madison, who dances the other side of the referee and skips away from a Rebo. And looks for Sun Hyeong-min, who's racing into open green space down the left. Hits it, left footed, great recovering challenge from the Southampton skipper, Jan Bednarek, who's hurt himself in the process, but a crucial tackle if to not make this scoreline even worse from their perspective. Yeah, great break from Tottenham into Madison. Again, heads on a swivel, finds a wonderful ball into Sun. And he just feels Sun in the form he's been, the season's gone past, that he will take that touch and score that chance. He just lingers a little bit, let's Bednarek to come back in, make that sliding challenge, and he doesn't get the shot away as he would have liked. Dibbling has it again on the edge of the Spurs penalty area, down the right side. He rolls it under his studs on his left boot and looks for support in the form of Kyle Walker-Peters, one to play with Uggachukru and back out towards Dibbling again on the right wing. We've played nearly 54 minutes here under the blue sky of North London. That wasn't the best bit of play from the teenage Dibbling though, as he tried to find Walker-Peters, but instead gave it straight back to another teenager in Bergwald, but he's now had his pocket picked and Southampton have it again, ball to the edge of the penalty area, Romero read it really well and stepped forwards out of defence and found a short ball to Solanke, who likewise has done well. It's now Romero who's the furthest player forward for Spurs, he's going to fall over the ball at this rate, eventually throws himself to the ground in the hope that the referee will give him a free kick, but instead that was a good old-fashioned case of a defender getting a nosebleed when he got too far up the pitch. The referee, when he gets the ball to Solanke, he does ever so well on the right-hand side to keep the ball away from Harrod Bellas, drive down back into Romero's feet, little nutmeg from Romero, and then he just dives on the ground because he knows he has no support. Manning has it back for Southampton down the left, the shadow over the top of this beautiful playing surface is gradually increasing, not so much sunlight out there now, as Manning, left-footed, tries to find a cross into the penalty area and instead blazes it behind into the wall behind that goal, it'll be a Spurs goal kick. Yeah, Manning, first time there, he has to cross that, as it comes out to him, he's in a really good position, just to whip his foot around and put it behind the top of the defenders, but instead he opts to try and take a touch and fires over, and that's what Southampton, when they get into the final third as well, that lack of just know-how or quality, just to put the ball into the right area. I think I just spied Papp Sarr getting changed to enter the fray here in the second half, or certainly Ad Legs, of course, his introduction on Thursday evening at Stamford Bridge was booed by the travelling Spurs supporters. Bergvall was taken off at that point, and then Sarr came on and scored the goal, and of course that was disallowed six minutes later, as Southampton have it again, once more attacking this Spurs penalty area, onto the left wing low ball from a Rebo, is cut out by Davies before it could reach Archer, and Spurs played amongst themselves at the back with plenty of composure, before Bergvall lifts it in the air up to the halfway line, it drops just inside Southampton territory, and Bednarek has the strength advantage over Solanke, it'll be a free kick for the Saints, just inside the Spurs half to the right of the centre circle, and it'll be a double change here for Ange-Postakoglu's side. Son Hyeong-min is the first to be withdrawn, and he'll be replaced by Wilson Odebe, the other change down there is Pappymatter Sarr, who's ready to come on too, and he will replace Rodrigo Bentonkirk, clearly with Thursday evenings Europa League quarter-final against Stamford in mind, Stephen Kelly. Yeah, absolutely, and Bentonkirk scored a second half, he's made some great challenges in the box, travelling around, getting on the ball, Son, after that run forward where he felt he was going to score, you think that's when you get him off now, you get his legs rested, he could have played a really important role, and Odebe, you know, he's missed a lot of the season so far, and I think in the moments I've seen him, he can be a real trend, I think he could cause problems for Stamford on this left-hand side, with his pace and his ingenuity, and Sarr is going to go in the middle of the park, and give their energy that they're going to need, they've been lacking the second half. Still 2-0 to Tottenham here as we approach the hour mark in North London, still 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool, 0-0 between Brentford and Chelsea, 4-30 on BBC Radio 5 Live, it's the Manchester Derby with the United against City Live, from Old Trafford on Tuesday, Champions League football returns full commentary, on 5 Live of Arsenal against Real Madrid, there is also commentary on 5 Sports Extra of England Women at Belgium in the Nations League, on Wednesday it's Sastan Ville's turn, and there'll be live commentary of their trip to Paris to face PSG in the last eight of the Champions League, and then of course on Thursday evening, that is when Spurs will welcome Frankfurt here, we'll have updates into the Lyon Manchester United commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, so the first couple of changes there for Rangiposter Cogler, as he's starting to turn his attention to more pressing matters, that will ultimately dictate how this season is reflected upon, should Spurs be able to finally capture a bit of silverware, that they still have Rashalison, the returning Rashalison on the substitutes bench, should they want to introduce him this afternoon? Charlie, I would say 100% that Salanki will be coming off 65-70 minutes, because he's put a shift in. Yeah, he's battled away against the big Benton Courage there as well, as he's just been withdrawn, and Suleyman is balling to the penalty area, he's not the best, yeah, he's battled away against Bednarec, the same Benton Courage being replaced too, and they're trying to save legs now, you wonder if Madison will soon be withdrawn as well, or maybe a Ramero at the back? Yeah, for me, Salanki's the one that's probably expelled the most amount of energy, he's been everywhere really, trying to put pressure, he's leading from the front when it comes to pressing the ball, trying to be that pivotal person that receives it as well, getting knocked about, and you feel Gera-Charleson on for 20 minutes could be really important. Sort of afternoon where he grab a goal as well, isn't it? Sunshine in Southampton, have it once more on the left wing, Matias Fernandez on the ball, he smashes it from left to right, drops at the feet of Kyle Walker-Peters awkwardly, and Otterbeer will nick it away from him, cross the halfway line down the left, and find James Madison in a pocket of space as per usual. Now Brennan Johnson, who let's not forget is on a hat-trick, tries to stab it in the direction of Salanki, rocketed back at Ramsdale by Harwood Bellis, who does well, plenty of composure back there, from the Southampton keeper to play it out, and they'll now have themselves a free kick, and it might be a yellow card it is for Pedro Polo. I'll tell you what, Ramsdale did really well there, because Harwood Bellis fired at him from what? Four or five yards away? He just left foot, just beautiful little touch at the left-hand side, cuts out Salanki's press, and then lets him get away with a book. It was under severe pressure there to make sure that touch was perfect. They made it look really easy when it had every opportunity to wrong foot him. He's going to be a Premier League footballer again next year, isn't he? You would think so, but you just don't know. The question marks over Ramsdale are not going to be whether he's a good goalkeeper. It's going to be, why did you choose to go to Southampton? Is that the level you feel you're at? I don't know. I didn't understand it, because I think for most people, listen, obviously, Hounsoy is a wonderful team, for most people would have had Southampton within their tree of going down. For Ramsdale, who was on the cusp of winning a Premier League a few years ago, yes indeed, Matias Fernandez for Southampton on the right wing, fakes to cross it onto his left foot. Pulsar trigger from range, blocked by James Madison, gets back up again, looked through a 1-2 with Walker-Peters. Spence gets there first, and will win inside a free kick. Walker-Peters looks at the assistant and says, no, you've got that one wrong, it should have been a corner kick, but it is a free kick instead. Even Eurich, the Southampton manager, has just gone across to a couple of these substitutes and told them to come back in the direction of the technical area. He's clearly of making, thinking of making a few changes now, as they stare the trapdoor into the EFL right in the face. They've got less than half an hour to just simply delay their relegation. They will become the fastest team to ever be relegated to the championship. In match week 31, this is the previous record, with six games left, it's held by Derby County and Huddersfield Town. Today, they would become the team with the earliest relegation on record from the top flight. They still need another couple of points to surpass Derby County's record as the worst team in Premier League history. They're on 10 points, Derby were relegated in 2008 with just 11. Meanwhile on the pitch, Spurs have got themselves a free kick inside the centre circle and just inside the Southampton half, 62 minutes are on the clock, still 2-0 here, 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool and 0-0 between Brentford and Chelsea. To Romero, who stood over the ball, had a couple of headers brilliantly saved by Ramsdale in the first half, both of them flying, diving headers, sort of stuff that you love to put in when you're a kid. Madison tries to turn away from Ogachuk, where it's blocked by the Southampton midfielder and it comes back off of Bergval and it'll be a Southampton throw. Fred Bergval, I don't know whether he didn't see it or didn't think he could execute, but Spence had made a run in behind there and he was in. He was absolutely in, no one attract him and Bergval just didn't get his head up on time to find that pass. There's usually a number of goals between these two sides when they do meet. Spurs won 5-0 at Southampton in December, that proved to be Russell Martin's final game before he was sacked. 5-0 was also the fifth time that Spurs have scored at least five against the Saints, which is the most between any Premier League clubs currently in the top division. Johnson finds Saar inside the Spurs half in the sunshine on that far side as they kick from right to left. Saar trying to cut through the middle of the Southampton midfield and attack their defense, but a strong recovering tackle made by a Rebo sees Southampton back in possession once more. Two players stripped and ready to come on on the near touchline for the visitors, James Brie. I think it appears to be one of them down there, where Smallbone is another one. As Wellington, is it? Yeah, Wellington, Smallbone down there. It will be a Rebo who's withdrawn for Southampton with Smallbone returning from injury and that other change, the Brazilian Wellington coming on to replace Ryan Manning, so a straight swap for both of those positions. And is it? What Southampton's interesting is when you look at their kind of fun five-ish or a fun training in two homerfielders, like the age, you know, Dibbling's nine is 19, Archer's 23, Sulamana's 23, Hugo Trucquas 21, Fernandez is 20, you know, have a Rebo off, he's in here. Yeah, Solanki gets the other side briefly of Bednarek, the Southampton defenders getting back, trying to recover another brilliant save from Ramsdale. Solanki does really well and now Ramsdale spilled the ball on the edge of the box and that might well be handball. It is as he slid to try and keep a hold of the ball with Solanki there, he slid out of his 18-yard box and the free kick has been given. Ramsdale makes a brilliant stop initially and then as he legs it along his byline to try and keep a hold of the ball before Solanki could get there, he slid, tried to grab it, but in doing so has left his penalty area. Yeah, Solanki, middle of the pitch, ball over the top, takes it down, has time to turn, still get a shot away, Ramsdale pulls off a wonderful save down to his left hand side and then he's scrambling out and Solanki can see that he's going at such speed, he's going right towards it as your box, gets his hands in the ball and acts and ends up just sliding out with the ball in his handbook. It's a wonderful stop from him, but again, defensively so poor from Southampton, Solanki should not be able to bring it down there, then turn and get the shot away. It takes him a while to get under control. We've played 20 minutes in the second half and Southampton have been much improved on their first half performance. You think if a goal was to come for them, they might well get themselves back into this game, but another goal for Spurs would surely put this game and their status in the Premier League to bed. Ball curled in, so what's the back post in the direction of Romero, but flicked away before it could reach him. It's out with Wilson Otterbeer who's closed down by Wellington and that'll be a Spurs throwing around 15 yards or so up the touchline from the corner flag away to our left hand side. Spence finds Bergvall and back into the heart of the defence for Davis once more. A reminder if you just joined us on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Southampton will be relegated if they lose as they are doing here in North London this afternoon. It's game week 31. It would be a new record for the fastest ever relegation. This is Spence in the top flight, I should add. I've not looked in the EFL for those. Back to Vicario and Vicario will find Romero and Postacoglu stood on the edge of his technical area. He'll be a relieved man that things so far have been going swimming. Yeah, Tottenham are not being great the second half. They've nowhere near kept possession the way they should have already done the first half and you expect to show something. Tottenham started again to the groove now slightly and I expect to be maybe one or two more changes from the Spurs side. They've conceded possession and Smallbone has it for Southampton in his bright pink kit. Back to Kyle Walker-Peters. Still 3-1 to Fulham against Liverpool as Fernandez takes over now for Southampton. Back to Smallbone inside the penalty area. Pokes it in the general direction but actually nowhere near Cameron Archer and Spurs will clear it away once more out as far as Taylor Harwood-Bellis. More football to come later on BBC Radio 5 live the Manchester Derby at 4.30. John Murray and Leon Osmond will bring you that one as Uggachukru has it again and Fernandez has gone down off the ball and the referee has blown his whistle. Stop the game and it'll be a free kick for the Saints around three or four yards outside of the Spurs penalty area. I think he looked to play the 1-2 and saw his his run blocked off the ball after he'd played it Fernandez by Madison and I think Madison knew exactly what he was doing. Hasn't been booked just yet but might be doing well to avoid one. Yeah he just steps right across and there's no contact to the face. I can see Fernandez is down holding, rolling around holding his face but now he's about to step up and take his free kick perfectly able and Madison is just a body check. Just steps in this path, stops his run, not that he was going to get on the end of it. Fernandez gives the ball a kiss for good luck before he finally places it. It's five yards outside of the penalty area tucked in on the inside right channel. Right footed, floated ball edge of the six yard box headed away and out to the far wing by Dominic Solanke. Spence will find Sar and Spurs are looking to counterattack. Otterbeers made a run through the middle instead. They'll try to find Brennan Johnson down the right. Wellington has matched him stride for stride and poked it out inadvertently for a Spurs throwing just inside of the Southampton. It's a poor pass from Sar. Well as he comes inside all the space to aim for him behind Wellington but he just rolls it short not giving Brennan Johnson the opportunity to really open his legs up and get behind. And he had far better options as well through the central areas of the pitch and out to the left too. The Johnson one was almost the decoy one. That's not the one you play to pass the. Spurs fans haven't been given a great deal to smile about here at home in recent weeks. You can say recent months really they've won just one of their last 10 Premier League games here in North London. They're on their way to two in 11 now. When they approach the end of this Premier League season with a lot of important games as they try to avoid one of the worst finishes that they've seen in the top flight. They've not finished outside of the top 10 for 17 years but they will do as things stand. Their worst ever finish in the Premier League was 15th back in 1994 and they started the day 16th in the Premier League. That won't be where they end their day though as things stand at the moment though Southampton will be relegated as we approach the 70th minute. It's still spurs to Southampton. Neil was Madison unhelpfully dinks a ball up in the air back in the direction of Romero controls it comfortably enough and you wonder Stephen Kelly whether or not the the start that Southampton made to this second half where they had all that energy behind them and they were firmly on top for maybe the first 15 to 20 minutes or so has just started to dwindle away. Yeah it's petered out. They they they got on top Tottenham gave them some really good opportunities to go and win the ball high up in the Tottenham half and then try and attack them and they didn't really take advantage of we looked at the opportunities they had to put decent balls in the box put crosses in or make the right decision in the passing but they just didn't do that and now they seem to just drop back into that old form of getting men behind the ball and waiting for Tottenham to do something. Spence gets away from a couple of Southampton players the ball ricochets into the path of Saar. They'll play it back to Porro dead centre 10 yards outside of the Southampton penalty area now Brennan Johnson's ball drops just in behind Dominic Salanke falls into the feet of Kyle Walker Peters and he'll try to find the ball out to Fernandez but it's been brilliantly read by Virgval who slides and recovers possession for Tottenham. It's with Otterbeer now near the byline edge of the box and Matthias Fernandez will try to bring it away. Virgval there once more works really hard the teenager but he won't be able to catch Dibbling this time who gets up towards the halfway line plays a one-two with Archer and then we'll find a ball out to that left touch line for Wellington and now it's hardwood Bellis who has it once more for Southampton inside the final 20 minutes here now at the Tottenham-Hotspur Stadium. Walker Peters again on the right wing Otterbeer coming back and closes him down Madison will force Dibbling back up towards Bednereck and he'll play it square across the back line for Harwood Bellis. He reads the game really well Virgval doesn't it he's snuffed it out the danger time and time and time again throughout the day but there is a bit of danger here but there's Virgval involved again along with Jeds Benson two of them there have really impressed this afternoon as they have done over the last few months these have been a tough few months for Tottenham for the players but those are a couple of players that have really stood out. I think you're probably looking at one and two for players this season for Tottenham realistically throughout the course of the year and they've come in by default as well you would never have had those two as starters or being as instrumental they have done. Spence was out in the cold he looked like he was going to get no opportunity here and has found his way in that's been brilliant throughout the season and Virgval again 19 year old not coming expecting to start especially in the midfield with Sarbasuma and Benton Curran looking like they had that secured him I think he's been excellent the energy to industry and then he shows a bit of goiling cleverness in the forward areas as well. A couple more changes for Southampton as Cameron Archer and Tyler Dibbling have both been replaced Sugawara and Paul Onoachu coming on now Onoachu is very much their kind of if in emergency break glass type thing this afternoon because he injured his ankle against Crystal Palace in the week he scored he scored two in his last two and he is a real handful all six foot seven of him. Yeah he is and you're going to bring him on bring him on when you're free kick you can fling into the box. That will be the plan no guesses to see who perhaps might be a target in the end they try to play it out towards the far side of the 18-yard box but it's easily dealt with by Spence who comes away with it and then he's held up by Bednarak and Sugawara but he's done really well gone down won the free kick his manager Ange Posterkoglu is stood directly over the top of them at the moment and very warmly applauded the effort there of Jed Spence. Yeah good play Spence gets held up and you just see just dink the ball between the two players is it about to drive on and gets brought down. Sugawara was one of those players who's just come off the bench and one of the first things he did is bring Spence down and he's been linked with a move to Napoli in the summer. I don't think there's much thought that he will be playing in the championship for the club. This will be his 30th appearance of the season the Japanese international and as for Kario finds Davis and Davis will find Madison at the back one two with Spence but Ogachukwu's blocked the run of Madison similar to how Madison did to Fernandez about five minutes or so ago and that'll be a free kick for Spurs and Ange Posterkoglu stands hands in his black overcoated pockets and we've already mentioned Stephen Kelly will be thinking about the Thursday night to come against Antrek Frankfurt might also be thinking about the VAR goal that was disallowed from Lucas Bergwaltz offside in the first half too it could be far more comfortable than the two goal scoreline that it is but that is very much the Tottenham Hartsburg. So surprised he hasn't taken Tlanky off I feel like he's he's done everything he can this game he's run the channels he's pressed he's you know he's been a tough battle with the two centre backs who've been like bumbling from behind making tackles he's been physical and then you feel if you have if for Charleston is going to have an impact there going to be a player that you can potentially use on Thursday you want to get a few minutes in his leg today and it just looks like there's no sign of him making that change. Charleston is one of five Spurs substitutes that are out warming up away to our left hand side in fact in Charleston his bleach blonde hair very recognisable even from this distance he's warming up on the pitch at the moment as play takes place around 60 yards away from him with Bednarak who tries to find Walker Peters on the near touch line with a left-footed ball that in the end goes way beyond him and out for a throw in we've played 75 minutes it's still 2-0 to Tottenham Hartsburg they will go up to 13th in the Premier League table as things stand on 37 points five behind Brentford who are currently on 42 Brentford playing at home this afternoon to Chelsea still 0-0 there Liverpool meanwhile have got a goal back at Craven Cottage Lewis Diaz with that it's now Fulham 3 Liverpool 2 you wouldn't put it past them Steven Kelly to go and get an equaliser all more there would you. Now not the way they've been this season Fulham did so well they got back into that didn't they. Yeah 1-0 down in that game Fulham turned it round 3-1 up it's now 3-2 there and you can listen to it live on BBC Radio 5 live Tottenham Hartsburg very comfortably seeing this game out under the blue skies of north London this is Sugawara on the right wing has the number 16 on his back now Fernandez all of this about 10 yards outside of the Tottenham Hartsburg penalty area Walker Peters back to Sugawara lots of space to pick out a right-footed cross and he's put it over everyone but it will run all the way through to Camelden Sulamana hits it first time blocked by Brennan Johnson the score of both of those Spurs goals this afternoon and Porro turns it forwards in the direction of Solanki goes down once a free kick looks at the referee arm stretched out wide but the referee completely ignores him now a right-footed ball from Sulamana in the direction of Onoaciu, Vicario comes and again leaps high into the sky and catches it with both hands. Yeah good play from Vicario comes out and just takes the sting out of game completely but again I'm looking at Tottenham thinking who they're going to bring a substitute it looks like they have Archie Gray lined up potentially to come on now and Basuma. So that's Romero maybe centre-back and Basuma goes into the middle. Maybe for James Madison just to rest some legs there Spurs have made two subs so far this afternoon withdrawing Benton Kerr and Sun with Thursday evening in mind so Vicario is closed down by Smallbone away to our right Spurs kicking from right to left in Navy Blue and White this afternoon Southampton in pink shirts and shorts with Paul Onoaciu leading the line since he came on a few moments ago and scored two in his last two games four goals overall this season he's 30 years old he's six foot seven thanks Ben Davis takes the ball off of Vicario and then immediately gives him back again. Is it too simple Stephen Kelly from a Tottenham Spurs perspective to say that the season does live and die on what they do in the Europa League quarterfinals and more widely in that competition this season we'll come back to that because Sulamana now herring towards the Spurs penalty area hits one draws the save out of Vicario clawed away and then in the direction of Uggachukwu he throws himself at the ball but it's nothing but thin air and Spurs will look to counter attack in the opposite direction Sulanky's down off the ball Bergval has it finds Papsar and now it's with Odebër down the left he's not really got anybody with him so he'll put his foot on it and wait for Sa to be introduced Sulanky slowly gets back up again with an almighty limp as Bergval wonderfully picks out Porro 30 yards out he'll hit one well over the top of the crossbar and it'll be a goal king yeah I'm looking at Sulanky honestly it's about four or five times that either Harrow Bellas have been there because come right through the back of Sulanky as if you're the Spurs manager watching this game surely you can see the same thing we're seeing and you're thinking he's just said the forward he's the one you're going to start on to Rizal I would expect he's the one that leads the line he was heavily involved in the first half of the press and the way they go better I think Tottenham have missed him when he hasn't played and you're on the silly wrist by leaving him on the pitch just get him off and get someone else on that can play and Madison's the one that comes off RSU Gray Bergval comes off of Basu Man you think that's tactical but practically I'll be I'll be getting Sanky off the pitch yeah they've still got one substitution left they've made four now just to confirm those for you Madison and Bergval off as Basu and Gray have replaced them back to that question but I was going to say a few moments ago before Sulamana stung the palms of Vicario is it too simple to say that the season is all about that it is all about that I think I think that's it it can be as simple as that sometimes things can pivot on one thing and for Spurs that's this is everything to them they've been let's face it for Tottenham standards over the last 10 years or so well most of the time in the Premier League this has been an awful season for them when it comes to where they're going to finish they're nowhere near getting European space outtrue league position they're nowhere near domestic cup they have one team left this season which is to try and win silverware in Europa League which would be a phenomenal thing for them to do what they lost but yeah is that possible yes but they're going to have to play better than they do today because I don't think the Southampton team are a very good side and Spurs have dropped off and allowed them into it at times massively so in the second half though Southampton still have nothing to show for it and we're now inside the final 10 minutes of the game Southampton will be relegated at the conclusion of this if they lose 2-0 down here is Fernandez sneak little ball into Sugawara but he can't take it any stride inside the 18-yard box goes down and maybe once a penalty he's never going to get one the referee stopped the game just to make sure that the Japanese winger is okay gets a pat on the back from Ben Davis and being told to get up really from from all quarters catch a little bit of a replay there there's very little in that and the game will resume in a moment certainly not with a penalty but I'd say you know never speak too soon with VAR but if completely innocuous yes now it's the ball gets stuck behind them and Spence as checks as Ron comes back and I think what happens is as he goes down Spence as he turns and kind of knees him in the calf slightly and so it can be painful but it's not going to result in landing apart from the throw in which Kyle Walker Peters is stood over at the moment has the ball in his left hands Sugawara is just retrying his right boot full and still leading by three goals to two against Liverpool still goalless between Brentford and Chelsea we've got great week in front of us on BBC Radio 5 live a couple of Champions League commentaries for you and a Europa League commentary as well Champions League on Tuesday and Wednesday Europa League on Thursday and we also start our coverage live from Augusta for the first golfing major of the year Rory McElroy again trying to win that career Grand Slam Scotty Sheffler likely to be the man to beat Walker Peters right footed ball off the right wing finds small bone back to Sugawara 82 minutes have been played small bone picks it up again and finds Ogre Chukwuk every single Southampton player apart from Ramsdale inside the Spurs half at the moment Ogre Chukwuk finds Sugawara on the right wing Fernandez was an option but instead it's the left-footed ball that somehow manages to go over the head of the giant Onowachu and behind for a goal kick in if ever a passage of play summed up Southampton's afternoon and indeed season that was it yeah that was it and I think that's kind of summed up this second half of the match it's been pretty forgettable just to say at least Nita team has really caused many problems Nita team has looked good in possession going forward attacking there's just been a real lack of anything in the second half first half was easy but I said before the game that this fixture kind of looked like it was potentially going to be a preseason friendly and this second half is basically being a preseason friendly Nita team really wanting to exert themselves too much and yeah going through the motions almost Stephen Kelly when you're right you're right and you are right Southampton have made another change and if they're clinging to straws and clutching at them here as well something to maybe smile about from a Southampton perspective Ross Stewart has returned from yet another injury my goodness is that man unlucky he's replaced Leslie Ogachukwu and Ross Stewart is back in a matchday squad for the first time since October and here come Spurs it's with Salanki edge of the penalty area to put the gloss on this left-footed blazes high and wide and over and then behind to the awaiting Spurs fans it's still 2-0 to Tottenham Hotspur we're about to see the 84th minute takeover it's a good pass from basuma into his feet and Salanki takes it really well drops onto his left foot but then Bednarek I think defends this really well gets out leans into him just urges him shuffles him away from the goal slightly and then when he hits the ball he's leaning back and forwards it way over the left hand side and you can tell as Bednar came across he wasn't going to make it Salanki's nicked it here he's got it again he's approaching the edge of that Southampton penalty area and Bednarek has made the challenge snuffs out another Spurs attack we've got another Tottenham change on the way Mattias Tell is ready to come on maybe for Dominic Salanki time will tell yeah six minutes he's trying to save his legs listen he's had a chance to score there but I am surprised this didn't happen earlier in the match yeah I am too and as you've mentioned on a couple of occasions he's he's worked hard and bundles will small bone to the ground dishing out a bit of the treatment that he's received from Harwood Bellis in Bednarek all afternoon yeah they they fair Bednarek and Harrod Bellis when the balls being in the box and Cross have come in I think and organising defensively they're great but when the balls been playing in Salanki's feet they've been right up on Tottenham nipping ass heels you know making some some quite fiery tackles on them from behind and he's taken it taking a fair few hits on Anki into the final five minutes here on BBC Radio 5 sports extra that Steven Kelly the former Spurs Birmingham Reading fullback of course with the Republic of Ireland as well Spurs still leading by those two Brennan Johnson goals to know both of them coming in the first half the first after 13 minutes the second four minutes before the break in between they thought they'd got another through Bergwald only for it to be disallowed by VAR for offside it took well over five minutes to come to that decision as the Pesuma has it for Spurs plays a one-two with Otterberg gets it back again right in the heart of the pitch as the Spurs fans burst into song and Brennan Johnson in that small area of pitch which is still bathed in beautiful north London sunshine takes over gives it to Poro Poro trying to play the one-two in behind down the inside right channel and instead it goes behind for a Southampton goal kick and there is that change and he'll be as you mentioned Steven Kelly really grateful Dominic Solanke of the four minutes of rest yeah and pass the car you're looking after centre forward there for the big game on Thursday night he put a shift in you have to give it to him he's worked really hard I think Solanke you know he stays fit for the full season I think Tottenham Tottenham season would be slightly different than what it is because he leads the line really well he presses really well he gets the rest of the team up the pitch and he's taken a fair few kicks today so yeah get them off I suppose never too little too late it's a four five-minute rest point I guess from Dominic Solanke and Sposter Kogalu's perspective they were hoping that he got a goal he's not scored now in I think any of his last nine Premier League games Solanke and you know strikers they they feed on it they live off the confidence of goal scoring and I suppose if there's a team you're on it you would think you're going to have a chance to get a goal it's going to be Southampton but honestly I think the second half if the best way to describe second half is just meh if it meant emoji would describe the second half of the game in an instance there's been no no nothing of note almost as Sulamana now picks it up for Southampton switches it from left to right and finds Sugawara inside the right corner of the penalty area now hits it draws a good save out of the car that's a really good save probably probably the best save that he's made all game because it might well take a slightest of flicks on the way through diving down to his right hand side makes a good stop snuffs out the danger and grabs the ball as well yeah that's the best moment of second half Southampton work well and as he as he gets this he just drops his shoulder to the left creates a little bit of space and then he hits it with no real back lift but there's there's a tremendous bit of power on this and Vicario has to do well to get down quickly and knock this out make sure he doesn't knock it into Southampton body as well so it was a really good save from Vicario really well hit we're into the 89th minute here in north London as Porro spins away from Sulamana and then draws the attention of Smallbone they play it in triangles between Porro and Sarr and Johnson now with Archie Gray who signed last summer from Leeds United such a promising young footballer I watched a lot of him last season in the championship with Leeds he just lets the ball run by him so composed on the edge of his home penalty area he of course comes from fairly good stock son of Andy grandson of Frank great nephew of Eddie Gray as Mattias Tell leads the line charging down the press on Aaron Ramstale who played into the heart of the defense and Southampton will build again down the left it's nice to see Gray you know in the position where I would expect him to play for Tottenham he's playing that the whole limit field role which I feel if he gets given the opportunity to play that could be really pivotal for Spurs and unfortunately he's being deployed out right back centre back left back this season all through Tottenham's injury crisis and he quit himself really well for a teenager but that position he's in now is the one where you feel if he gets game time in there could really make a difference think of him and Bergwald a couple of years could be brilliant yeah both of them only 19 Sulamana has it for Southampton dinked ball towards the back post Fernandez controls it and fires home through the legs of the cario Southampton have themselves a goal back inside the final minute of the game it is Spurs 2 Southampton 1 yeah great finish from Fernandez but the time he has to bring that down like the cross comes in I'm thinking head of first time he does it he ups the chest down I think Gray he's bringing it down he's not going to get an opportunity to get this shot away but he does he has time to bring it down take his time fire between for Cario's legs with no one from Tottenham really getting back to him Spence has got drawn inside because I think the centre forward has peeled off the shoulder of Davies but the time he has to take this down and hit it and listen I know it's the last moment in the game but Tottenham getting poor defended every goal here is a vital ball I know most goals are but in this game today every goal has been a vital ball it was chat briefly for offside the goal stands we're into four minutes of stoppage time at the end of the game it is Spurs 2 Southampton 1 and as things stand they will still be relegated today they have to avoid defeat and some gallows humor from some of the Spurs fans drenched in sunlight in the far left corner away from us chanting that they're staying up they know they're not doing they're just trying to avoid going down in record breakingly quick fashion which they are still doing so if they lose this game there is a roar from those Southampton supporters on the far side of the ground though and from nothing in this second I've mentioned it at length really Steven Kelly there have been very very few chances for either side now Southampton have got the wind in their sails yeah they really do and you feel with the size advantage they have in the centre forward positions now they need to hit the ball in the box they need to get it in the early and they need to turn their cross as well but they're giving the ball away here and allow Tottenham to regroup and probably put this down the pitch for Carrier it's going to get a long long free kick but Tottenham the second half it's just been it's been a really poor performance of Spurs it's been a poor performance of Southampton but Tottenham did not in any way the level of complacency I think they showed the second half is exactly what happened they thought they had the game you know dead to rights and haven't really turned up so Spurs 2 Southampton 1 it's finished at the GTEC community stadium Brentford Nill Chelsea Nill on the BBC Sport website it is still Fulham 3 Liverpool 2 they are hanging on on BBC Radio 5 Live where you can listen to the final few moments of that one they are leading by three goals to 2 in the 97th minute still to come up 430 Manchester United against Manchester City also live on 5 Live Spence reads the danger snuffs it out as Walker Peters was trying to find a pass down that right wing in the direction of Sugawara who has helped since he's come on has added something a little bit different Fernandez has impressed as well since they made a couple of those changes he'll be thrilled with the goal but otherwise there's been very little to be impressed about when it comes to Southampton this afternoon four added on we've played two of those it's with Sulamana on the left wing again everybody for Southampton Bar the goalkeeper well inside Spurs territory having overload over in this right hand side with Sugawara and Walker Peters and that's exactly what they've tried to exploit now it's the touch of Sugawara that lets that down in the end otherwise they could well have been in yeah silver one against Jed Spence and just that touch gets away from but they're in a really good position there to try and cause Spurs a problem still going at Craven Cottage still 3-2 to Fulham against Liverpool long searching ball from left to right here meanwhile from Southampton has gone out for a Spurs throwing deep in their own territory in the left fullback position and very very slowly Jed Spence ambles over grabs the ball puts it under his arm Spurs will move up to 13th in the table should things stay like this should they be able to get out of here with all three points it's going to be another Spurs throwing on this near touch line Southampton thought they might have had one for a moment but instead Spurs will and once more we'll take their time over at Stephen Kelly yeah no rush of Spurs now just wind down the clock get a you want to say comfortable win to some extent in this game because Southampton haven't really showed much but the lack of goal scoring opportunities second avatar and has been what they've lacked Otterbeer has it dead center it got a three on three across towards Brennan Johnson goes down over the stretched leg of Wellington it's a penalty penalty for Tarnham Hotspurs of course it will be checked Wellington the substitute committed and Brennan Johnson whose honour hat trick went down and says please let me take it he's in discussion with Mattias Tell I believe on that far end of the pitch and it's an opportunity for Spurs to sew up the three points and put a nail in Southampton's coffin yeah it is it's to be fair as soon as Wellington goes in he puts his hands on his head I think that was Evan the referee it was a poor challenge no need to dive in there I think Brennan Johnson's gone away from play I don't think he's going to get on to the end of it either he's not happy about it either but it's Mattias Tell who stands over the ball and Johnson's almost being consoled I think by some of his teammates because he doesn't get to score the hat trick perhaps yeah but I yeah I want Johnson to get a hat trick be wonderful for a regular hat trick but if he's the penalty taker how many opportunities and many times we've seen this before where they get at and they miss well it's Mattias Tell against Aaron Ramsdale it's a goal that will finally put South Hampton out of their misery we played 95 minutes it's a direct straight run up from Tell he now wheels away stutter steps and scores and with that relegate Southampton to the championship in record breakingly quick fashion Spurs will return to winning ways in north London their first victory here since the middle of February in the Premier League but Southampton their fate finally confirmed it spurs three Southampton one yep and Tottenham getting a goal second half good penalty by Tell Ramsdale goes the right way gets it handled and actually I thought maybe he's going to save this just can't reach for another fan as good pace on the penalty in that far corner and yes and Tottenham you know if you give them for the first half for the better team deservedly to probably win this game create the most chances look the most dangerous but the second half neither side has really taken the game with a scuff in the neck and Southampton have gone out with a whimper really as we kind of expected well it's finished full on three Liverpool two so drama on the banks of the River Thames in the nation's capital there here this one's about to finish Tottenham three Southampton one the referee puts his whistle to his lips and that's it Spurs get all three points Southampton are relegated to the championship for a second time in three seasons the fastest team has ever been relegated from the Premier League it's finished Spurs three Southampton one Stephen Kelly yeah it's a it's a poor afternoon for Tenthampton they've gone down on record time no one would want that reputation they've got ten points they need to make sure they don't get the record of the least amount of points and if you have something to fight for that's something to fight for above in the first half they divide of confidence they've nothing about them at the moment and defensively the goals they gave away were so poor the lack of organization the discipline and the free kicks they gave away and this is not against a great Tottenham time at the moment Tottenham are not in a brilliant spell of playing wonderful football or electric they're a team that are not the most confident themselves so yeah not a great game to witness today but Tottenham get three points look forward to it you're open league on tour as Anta-Tampton unfortunately go down with that that woeful record of being the earliest team in the Premier League history to get relegated yeah those Southampton players currently gathering in the centre circles staring longingly into the distance in the general direction of the remaining Southampton supporters that have made the journey from the south coast today and have been bathed in sunlight all afternoon and in all fairness and credit to them the vast vast majority of the traveling thousands have stayed and are now applauding in the main those Southampton players as they slowly make their way across to them their fate has been sealed no side prior to today had ever been relegated with seven games still remaining two teams have gone down with six left Derby and Huddersfield but but never never quite so quickly Aaron Ramsdale leads the group over there he can be confident that he's done all he can certainly today this score line would have been far far worse but full credit to those Southampton fans who are singing at the top of their voices I think if anything can show you the value of fans and the importance of them to your club it's that right now they are literally singing chanting cheering to and they have every right to be angry every right to be disgruntled and giving their their their toughness into what what these fans said to have the team have done but they're celebrating them they're cheering them they're giving them you know it's amazing that this is this is remarkable to see that these fans are still here and cheering them and this is what football is about it's about those those right there Ramsdale has gone across and given his shirt to a young supporter at the other end of the field the Spurs fans are taking the applause of the remaining Tottenham Hotspur supporters there aren't that many left to be fair to them now but they'll be relieved to see a win here they've now won two of their 11 Premier League games in recent weeks it's been pretty miserable in north London for them but as the sunshine has returned so has that winning feeling so has the smile on Ange Posterkooglu's face and boy did they need that going into such an important fortnight with the Europa League yeah they did they really did I think the problem with teams is you can't just pick and choose your formula you can't just raise it for certain games I think you have that for certain level of consistency if you want to be successful and Tottenham haven't had that a win today against what was a poor such Hampton team it's not going to exactly in the amour them with so much confidence but it's going to make them feel a little bit better but what they do they've come in and do a game on the back of a win which is important and Thursday is everything to this side now Stephen thank you for your company this afternoon the game wasn't that much fun but your company was I'll tell you that Spurs have beaten Southampton by three goals to one they return to winning ways ahead of an important fortnight but Southampton have been relegated from the Premier League they are the first side to do so so soon in a season there is now more cricket on the way on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra",
