  "transcript": " That won 7-0 here against Leipzig to equal Manchester City's biggest European win. Three changes for Bayern, Cancelo, the City Lone drops to the bench for them, former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane and German great Thomas Müller are amongst the subs as well. So Leon Goretzka, Kingsley Coman and Dioppa McCano come in there without their top scorer. The former Stokeman, Eric Maxim, is supermoting, he's had a brilliant season but he's out with a knee injury. So we are underway in front of a full house here in Manchester at the Etihad. Bayern Munich getting us underway playing in their red home kick kicking from right to left in Manchester City with the Sky Blue shirts, the white shorts and the Sky Blue socks picking up possession with Grealish down the left hand side taking on Benjamin Pavar and getting passed in brilliantly. Grealish to the edge of the area slides it in, De Bruyne won't quite run for city in the box. De Bruyne is trying to win it back, Bayern trying to get the foot in but Arno still was up there as well. De Bruyne lifts the ball up to the back post it's over the head of Gundogan who will pick it up on the left hand side and out to the left he goes with Nathan Akke. Manchester City will slow it down just and pull it back to Diass but my word Deon didn't they start with some energy there having won the ball back to Bayern. Just great work just making sure they clear their lines getting the ball out wide to Grealish. Grealish has no help at all he thinks right. Pavar I'll have a run at you no problem at all let's see what you've got. Brie's past two players and nearly created something for City. Yep great start from Grealish who says he believes he is in some of his best form of his Manchester City career at the moment but here comes Gnabry into the penalty area for Bayern lead away at the back by Ruben Diass got a little deflection as well but picks up on that left hand side by Bayern Munich and they'll send it all the way back to the halfway line and Matias delict to squares it to Upper Meccano so Bayern Munich in possession and out on that right hand side almost stolen by Harland on the halfway line but Kimmich will keep hold of it and here they come down the right now by Bayern with Komen frenetic pace to this game in the opening two minutes here on five live in this Champions League quarterfinal Akke gets the block in will spin away to Diass cleared away up towards Harland on halfway and will be picked up by Upper Meccano wants more dicks the ball forward but Akke will steal possession and clear out to the left hand side so we get our first look at this Manchester City formation and it's an interesting one so far John Stones just dropping back at the moment into central defence but he can step up into that three man midfield with Manchester City in possession but at the moment it's Bayern Munich so Stones dropping back as the ball is over the head of Manuel Acangia will bounce out of play but interesting Dion that it Stones going central and Acangia coming over to this right hand side when it's the fourth visit yeah and I'm slightly wary about that and you know what Sarny's pace and against Acangia I'm not sure how that's going to work we'll see how the game pans out I mean on the other side you've got Akke against Kingsley Komen as well I mean he dealt with Saka in the lead quite uh quite effectively maybe they're backing him to deal with Komen again one on one so Nathan Acke has it over on the left hand side and now with City in possession they do switch to that back three with Stones in midfield so in possession the City formation for now is Edison in goal as Acangia under pressure from the former Manchester City man Levera Sarny and Edison came to clear that ball out Acangia decided to square it instead to Ruben Diaz he did the right thing he did the right thing he did the right thing he did the keeper came running out I mean Karen will tell you better you want your defender to deal with that don't you yeah I mean ideally you don't want you want your defenders to defend and the goalkeeper obviously as good as Edison is like any sort of hesitation is is going to be dangerous in terms of the way this Byron Munich team has started this game I think so Edison in possession inside his own penalty areas Ganabri the former Arsenal man waits just outside the ball so Edison in goal for City the back three of Acangia Diaz and Acke ahead of them Stones and Rodri sitting to Brunner and Gundam out ahead of them with Silver Greenish and Harland up front as the rain begins to team down here at the Etihad the wind's swirling as well difficult conditions as Bernardo Silva picks it up on the right hand side up against Stumpenso Davies the Canada fullback so pulls it back to Gundawan just outside the penalty area and now Stones will lay it off to Rodri close down by Ganabri but Rodri dinks it out to the left hand side and here is Jack Greenish plays it in field to Kevin De Bruyne and back to Greenish once more as the wind whips up around us strong isn't it it's really strong we're low down here in the bottom tier at the Etihad but you're blocked normally from the elements we are blocked from the rain as Harland picks it up into the penalty area Harland left hand side drives over the bar right into the city crowd but but normally you don't feel any impacts of the wind in the fact that we're hearing it at the back of the press box here and I'm feeling that breeze around us it just shows the challenge of the conditions out on the pitch for these players yeah it's got to keep the ball on the grass as soon as that ball goes in the air it swirls in the air then it's a bit of a freefall so they'll both want to get the ball on the ground play through the third see what happens half a chance that for for Harland I think yeah 44 goals for the season would have perhaps expected a little better from Manchester City's main man although whilst from distance on the angle there's Manchester City have it on the halfway line with Johnstone so by Munich with Sommer in goal deputizing for their regular number one Manuel Neuer who's out for the season coming in done well the Switzerland international though after arriving in January from Borussia Munich glad back following Neuer's injury so he keeps goal for them the back four of Pavar, Apermeccano, Delict and Davies ahead of them Goretzka, Masiala and Kimmich with Coman, Sarno the former City man in Gnabry formerly of Arsenal up front as Pine Munich pick it up on the right hand side and send it all the way back to Jan Sommer all in black this evening who plays it out to the highest delict and out to the left hand side and Alfonso Davies have enjoyed such a good World Cup with Canada went down in history for them as well scoring their first ever goal at a World Cup finals it's played forward to Kimmich who plays it forward down the centre if you call the run of Masiala but he won't reach it Manchester City pick it up once more DLW yeah he does that really well Stowe's if he sees any danger if City give the ball away he'll just drop maybe into that right backer who he might even go inside Akangy and drop in between Akangy and Diaz just to make a four again so I think that's why he's allowed to play that role in their stones he's very intelligent he knows when to go he knows when to stay six and a half minutes played here in Manchester and we are goalless in this Champions League quarter-final also goalless in the other quarter-final also kicking off at eight o'clock in Fika against Inter and a reminder we have full commentary of Real Madrid against Chelsea live from Spain tomorrow three one five live as Bernardo Silva advances down towards the bar line depending by Davies slated off to De Bruyne who swings the ball in and Kunduam is there and Kunduam met it just behind Arlen who missed his header and Karen Barzli it's one of those where Manchester City would have hoped that Arlen just got there ahead of Kunduam but he didn't and it's over the bar oh it's a beauty I mean Bernardo Silva does so well to to work Davies and get some space to create for himself and he sees obviously Kevin De Bruyne at the edge of the area but whips in a beautiful cross I mean we've seen that so often to find that back post you know overhead kicker header from Harland and unfortunately just didn't connect this time yeah got one against Southampton at the weekend of course beautiful finish from a man who is looking to score his 45th goal in all competition stop it please stop it please that is just oh my word by a minute when the ball just inside their own half it would set a new record if he does score for a Premier League player for goals in a single campaign in all competitions he come by in turn the right hand side lay back to the former Manchester City man in Rosane now Kimmich the Germany midfielder to his compatriot Goretzka all the way back to the tyres delicts by Munich as we mentioned enjoying a very good Champions League campaign so far for this Thomas Tuchel's fourth match in charge after the surprise dismissal of Julian Nagelsmann last month he's been knocked out of the German Cup in the quarter finals that was a shock by Freiburg two big wins though in the league particularly over their title rivals Borussia Dortmund in his first match in charge which took by top of the Bundesliga they lead it now by two points ahead of Dortmund and it's one of those games that really could be title deciding by Munich fans will certainly hope so here they are in possession with Sane back to the left hand side plays it in field two and comes out Davies and Sane once again taking on Pernod Silva runs into Rodri and Pernod Silva will pick it up over the halfway line pursued by Sane still going very good challenge by Kimmich and delict will send it back to Sommer, Arland is closing down but Kimmich is going to be such a key player for Bayern in the centre of the park. Yeah they seem to just look for him to keep things steady get the ball to him and he'll just keep it moving he won't go too far staying up in the middle of the park and dictate things great challenge that Tomon Bernardo Silva was rescuing tackle not such a great challenge by Rodri on Masiala right in front of Thomas Tuchel he wasn't happy was he? So free kick to Bayern Munich and they get us underway once more nine and a half minutes plays here on five live goalless in this Champions League called a final first leg here is Alfonso Davies for Bayern just inside the Bayern half plays it back to delict and a permecane all the way back to Jan Sommer as Manchester City send Rodri up to joins Arland and De Bruyne just outside the penalty area and Bayern then play over that press he was Gennabry out to the right hand side midway through the Manchester City half and now Kingsley Coman it's marshaled well by Ake and Grealish so in field by and go Kimmich now plays the ball over the top opportunity here to get the ball into the area Kingsley Coman has it taken off his toes inside the box by Gundawan. Bayern picking up once more though out to the left hand side they go and Davies will drive it's wide and let's add for an update from England against Australia at Brentford Kelly Summers. 26 minutes gone Vicki England now Australia now a reminder the lioness is 30 games unbeaten but Australia ranked 10th in the world have started well here Lauren Hemp is getting some joy on the right but the Matildas are holding their own and they do look dangerous when Sam Kerr breaks the ball's fizzing around to on this wet surface perhaps part of the reason this game hasn't truly settled and Vicki this feels weird I shouldn't be updating five live listeners on England you are the voice of England nil nil. Well you can listen to commentary with the mouse Verruchy and chilli Plazzi over on five sports extra Manchester City in possession midway through their own half nil nil here latest for Scotland to him and they lead Costa Rica by two goals to nil and they're friendly and earlier at finished Portugal one Wales one coming to places at once Vicki you're needed to be in two places at the moment Vicki can if anyone can sadly not as yet D on that is not in my portfolio but very glad to be here with D on Dublin and Karen Bardsley and with you listeners on five live as Roderick fizzes the ball back to Edison and again the wind whips up around the Etihad the rain is swirling the interception is made by Kimmick and bounces out of play for Manchester City throw Vicki you know what I'm just noticing as well speaking of the winds swirling around if it's just blown Edison's towel onto the end line over there so that might be moving yeah one of the ball boys or ball girls might need to spot that it's just inside the six yard pops at the moment by that near post for Edison and in dark purple the Manchester City goalkeeper neither goalkeeper worked as yet Somer for Bayern and Edison for Manchester City is both of these sides continue to test each other out as the ball is fizzed back by Grilish to Nathan Erkay and Pep Guardiola stands with his arms folded on the edge of his technical area did say in the build up to this one that that Bayern are not a team built to think it will happen second leg they're coming to win says he knows that culture very well from the three years that he's spent there so far it's a tight game 12 and a half minutes gone as the ball is lost by a canji down the right hand side picked up by Nerozana who plays it in field to Pizziano who goes down that time he gets no joy from the referee Hayser skill Manzano in Manchester City have it on the left hand side they're still just inside their own half there now good new arm we'll take it over the half by nine nice layoff by Grilish to Sabrina Grilish will chase Pavel will get there first the French defender does well to shepherd that ball right in front of that away contingent of Bayern Munich fans as Bayern can't keep hold of it though and Manchester City pick it up just inside the Bayern Munich half goalless here in this Champions League called a final on five live commentary coming up tomorrow of Real Madrid against Chelsea and we'll be hearing from our commentary team of Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton at halftime in this game here is Bernardo Silva right hand side of the penalty area trying to ease his way past Alfonso Davies he stands up well the Canada international but Silva does better gets the ball across cleared away by Kimmich at the back for Bayern out to the left hand side of the area where it's picked up by Nerozana and he's dispossessed by Kandji and Bernardo Silva has it once again now he was barged into by Jamal Masiala there the linesman was right there didn't see anything wrong within summer take to touch Arlen closes him down almost on the goal line and summer just about gets the ball away it goes out for a Manchester City throw and their deal is Harlins credit to Ian Stick in a nutshell absolutely that's the spark that this is this game needed a spark it was that challenge on Bernardo Silva right in front of the referee's assistant and then it went a little bit messy they tried to play across the box the keeper doesn't like that surely not even not two yards of no no no I hated that I'm not gonna lie anytime the ball was coming across the face in the mouth the mouth of the goal oh I had to I need to put my foot through that Manchester City take the throw great pressure by Harlins summer just about doing enough to get the ball away they've won another throw Manchester City level with the edge of the Bayern Munich penalty area goalless as the Etihad raises it's for his Harlins trying to turn inside the penalty area but is challenged and then late challenge by Grealish on Coven right on the edge of the Bayern Munich penalty area free kick to Bayern Munich and this may be a stern talking to and nothing more from Jesus Gil Manzano to Jack Grealish but gotta be careful with those sort of challenges it is a clumsy one see on it is yeah I think Jack was he I know Jack musically well he can't get frustrated when he's been manhandled all his teammates have been manhandled he likes to get involved and let his opponent know that he's not gonna accept being kicked all his teammates being kicked that was a little bit late from Jack bit messy but get the ball forward to Jack as soon as possible and to Bernardo wide as well because that's the way they're gonna get in former England striker Dion Dublin and former England and Manchester City goalkeeper Karen parsley here with us on five live this evening 15 minutes gone goalless as Manchester City win a free kick just inside their own half lifted over the top by Ruben Diaz out to Grealish on the left hand side beautiful control but the pass is just behind Harlins and here comes Missy Arlow for Bayern Munich played him fielding out to Missy Arlow once again left hand side well anticipated by Bernardo Server at Kanji then as well to slide in and keep possession for Manchester City full goes out of play for a throw to by and Pep Guardiola's furious he's out of his technical area he wanted a free kick for a foul on a kanji yeah I think I think it was a free kick and City giving the ball away as well I think Jack gave the ball away the understanding between Jack and Harlow they're not quite clicked yet but he's not happy with the way that they're giving the ball away and he wants him to squeeze quicker that's the motion we're seeing that's the way that City have to play that's the way that City always want to play here is a pomecano I think it's center half full by in played forward now through the third to Kimmich and now out to the right hand side as by an advance once more he lists Kimmich once again just outside the center circle played it back to the pomecano and Karen Bartley 16 and a half minutes gone it's from fairly even so far but but City looking the more dangerous in and around the penalty area yeah I think um I think Dion you've set up beautifully at Harlins with his predatory instincts he's always ready to capitalise on anything here come by and out to the right hand side with Coman Missy Arlow is in the center Coman pulls it back to Gnabry 20 yards out thought about the shot Missy Arlow then slips on the edge of the D out to the left hand side Alfonso Davies and now Sane into the area blocked away by Akangy who brings it down very nicely as well but can't complete the clearance there will be a throw to buy in deep in Manchester City territory Alfonso Davies was kind of taken a little bit further up the referee just isn't forward but eventually takes it pretty much from Raffi Wells anyway and Byron have the ball on the halfway line here is a for McCona stepping past Harlins lays it off to Pavar and out to the right hand side with Coman by an imposition just inside their own half there's been a goal in the match between England and Australia Kelly Summers England nil Australia won 33 minutes on the clock who else but Sam Kerr it was a long ball forward Kerr beat the offside trap Leah Williamson was tracking back thought she had control of it but she only played it into the path of Kerr who tapped home England's 30 match unbeaten run is very much at risk England nil Australia won well well you can listen to commentary of that match over on five sports extra here at the Etihad goal list between Manchester City and Bayern Munich in this Champions League quarter final first leg Scotland's women incidentally are now three nil up in their friendly with Costa Rica that has been playing for 40 minutes Manchester City in position need to weigh through their own half yeah it's it's slowed down a little bit now what City like to do is a crossfielder ball they play one side they play two or three passes on one side of the pitch and then what they do is they draw the opponents in to try and squeeze and then they try and go for the crossfielder ball but tonight Vicky the wind is so bad that they it's not reaching that opposite end of the pitch and they're trying to play through the thirds and it's just not working at the moment for either team yeah it's exactly that as Bayern Munich have the ball just inside their own half they just tried that crossfield switch that Dio was talking about but it held up so much in the swirling air here in Manchester that Pavaugh had the easiest of tasks for Bayern right back just to wait for it to come down and and head it away balls out of play for a city throw Karen Bardsley yeah it has been a really well balanced game I think you know to your earlier point Vicky you know that one chance obviously for Harlan on the end of the the touchline I mean the goal line basically but yeah I think Bernardo's getting that Davies quite enjoying that Stones is picking up some good spaces but I'm surprised that the Bronner hasn't actually been on the ball a little bit more here comes Grealish down the left hand side pulls it back to Nathan Ake he will play the ball into the penalty area the crossfield switch doesn't work for Bernardo Silva tried the little back heel to control it goes out of play for a throw to Bayern and the wind is just the variable that at the moment it's just so hard to predict yeah that tells me that the ball from Ake on the diagonal to Bernardo Silva tells me that that went with the wind because the one over to Jack Grealish actually held it held it up into the center half so it's swirling at the moment and it's all about being patient and going to feet if you can that's what they're doing at the moment Manchester City here is Bernardo Silva de Bruyne on the overlap de Bruyne down to the bar nine cross in first time Gudubama's making the run of the near post it's an excellent covering interception by Joshua Kimmick who gets the congratulations from his teammates it's a Manchester City corner he's absolutely bossing at Kimmick I mean he's been that you know metronome that we spoke about earlier in the week Vic the Kira Walsh role that she was playing for the lionesses just constantly getting on the ball checking shoulders but what what a block that was so corner to Manchester City Kevin de Bruyne is over these from the right hand side drifted in high to the edge of the penalty area will come all the way to Jack Grealish he's now midway through the buy-in half again wind playing havoc with those deliveries as Bernardo Silva plays it out to the right hand side that ball was on the ground but it's poor D on its faster bro and it's out for a throw City just losing their way a little bit in the last five minutes you know what I think that was actually off the training ground that ball from Kevin de Bruyne was purposely missed out that group of players in the six yard box fighting for space and Jack Grealish stayed out on the corner of the box on the other side I think Jack was meant to come forward and take it on the volley slowed it down so buy-in throw goal is here midway through the first half goal is in the other quarterfinal between Benfica and insert as well as Gunderman plays it forward Grealish feet Harlan first time shot it's taken from the edge of the area and some of all Kevin great play though Karen great play little one two Harlan again yeah exactly yeah I think you really should have it I mean great awareness from from Jack to go Jack Grealish to go and press there nice little turn on the bar a little pirouette and ball through to Harlan but yeah I really should have finished it we expect that from him now I think here come by with Ganabri the former Arsenal man out to the right hand side to see win it and then lose it again here is Ganabri plays it forward looking for the run of Lyrissane very well cleared away by John Stone slotting back into that centre half roll from midfield with Candy out to this right back position and the ball will bounce out of play for a throw to buy a minute well all right let's get the former strikers and the former keepers opinion that's the second time in this match and he does like to do this young summer he's taken a touch inside his penalty area Harlan's been right on him as a striker it must be encouragement Dion but as a goalkeeper Karen do you change the way that you play because Harlan's is going to see it I'll tell you why he's doing he's trying to draw the press that's what he's looking for he's looking for an extra option obviously the keeper is the overload at the minute the spare player so as soon as Harlan presses he's got to find that spare player quickly but it's you know he's an absolute unit Harlan like trying to run at you it's like a freight train so it um I can't imagine there's many players that he plays against on the training pitch that are as quick as he is so he's got to release it a lot quicker than that here come by a minute with Lyrissane 25 yards out plays it to Coman right hand side of the area checks one way trying to work room for the shot Ake does well holds him up and Coman in the end all he can do is prevent the goal kick place the ball out of play for a Manchester City throw midway through their own half goal that's lovely from Ake I mean he's so so balanced his approach Coman's obviously changing direction up down uh he's really really agile and well balanced but Ake is equal to it absolutely equal to it well he's one of the players at the moment Kingsley Coman that is in good goal scoring form for Byme unit that had been one of the issues under Nagelsman since the World Cup but six of his seven goals this season have come post the winter tournaments whereas the likes of Lyrissane, Manet who's on the bench been struggling to find the back of the net since the break in November and December it's Byme in position goal is here reminded that Byme have kept seven out of eight clean sheets in the Champions League this season and that includes two games against Inter Milan two games against Barcelona two games against PSG yes Manchester City tend to score for fun and Harland is foremost amongst that but with Byme in possession still just inside their own half this is one of their biggest tests in terms of a defensive unit that they're coming up against yeah I believe you're absolutely spot on the county misses the header Dave East down to the byline for Byme Munich can they fashion an opportunity pull back to Masihala just outside the penalty area turns one way than the other the 20 year old and plays it forward to Davies once more patient build-up play Coman's out on this left hand side forwards to Sane now Masihala once again Byme camped outside the Manchester City penalty area Kimmich now will play the ball into the box looking for the run at the far post Grealish is in there in the end it won't be controlled by Pava and it's out of play for a Manchester City goal kick yeah I think that's it that's possibly Byme's first control bit of possession there you know a minute or so on the ball trying to fashion away through City obviously getting back in numbers Harland five ten yards away from his own D helping Defender as well I mean Kimmich and Goetzka and Musihala not had any joy as yet but when they do they do it with pace so concentrations the keeper City out of possession definitely here is Grealish in possession for Manchester City as Ake goes all the way back to Edison Manchester City who are looking to make its nine wins in a row in all competitions it is their best one to form this season and as it's so often seems to come with Manchester City and putting it together at the perfect time the business end of the season can they do so in Europe as well as domestically lost possession Lioris Sane okay goes diving in as Sane pulls the ball back Masihala excellent blocked by Stones and cleared away by Manchester City midway through their own half but Masihala just starting to tick as Edison as the ball is played back to him will get the distance on it and clears it over the half way low and up towards Harland and it gets there ahead of Manchester City striker and the header is won by Kimmich out to the right hand side he goes and now Paavar with Coman who is really growing into this game Ake stood up well so far on that left hand side as Coman does get the ball into the area spins right across the penalty box and out of play for a throw to Manchester City deep in the own territory so nil nil here 26 minutes gone let's check in on the other Champions League quarterfinal first leg Benfica against Intas Sahayal Sahib yeah 25 minutes played here Vicky Benfica nil into Milan nil a chance each for either side Rafa Silva went close for Benfica inside the area he thotted his shot onto the chest of the Inter goalkeeper Anana and then a serving with the left foot to shot 30 yards out screaming over the top for Inter Milan then Vicky nil into Milan nil thanks Sahayal Sahayal just outside the Manchester City area now De Bruyne has it over the half way line out to the left he goes and Jack Grealish in field two Ilklai Gundewan here is Rodry 25 yards out plays it to the right and Bernardo Silva Harland is waiting in the centre just outside the six yard box Bernardo Silva has two players there with him and they hold him up well so we'll pull it back to John Stones now Bernardo Silva once more patience required from Manchester City is Rodry big shout of man on as Rodry will kill the epitome what a goal from Rodry just outside the D it's a thunderbolt into the top corner curling past the despairing dive of Jan Sommar a moment of real quality from the Manchester City midfielder it's his first goal in the Champions League and what a stunner it is Manchester City one by Munich nil that's a brilliant finish I've got to say Rodry goes to strike with his right but he chops it on his left foot and I'm thinking go on then use the wind curling in the top corner and he didn't put any pace on it he just left it on the wind he just curled from outside to in round two players Sommar's got no chance carrying the keeper when somebody strikes you like that it's so hard to get across because they set you so far away from the keeper. All I'm saying is like as a keeper you want to obviously get everything you want to be perfect but you can't that is perfection you know wow holy cow just the curl on the ball it's going top bins but that is so poor from gimmick he needs to get up to the ball you cannot allow a player of Raju's caliber to have that much time to open up the goal cut inside and you know put it on his left foot and absolutely like the detail of the curl on that that was a beauty third goal of the season for Rodry a superb strike and Manchester City with the breakthrough here against Bayern Munich Sommar has it at the back for Bayerners they get us underway Heather is won by John Stones out of play for brian throw Pep Guardiola is on the pitch I mean we know he's animated but he's straight out of his technical area the fourth official is meandering up to Guardiola to just point out that fact but it was interesting Dion while the players are celebrating the goal Guardiola and De Bruyne were having a very animated conversation that there's something more that Guardiola wants to be doing that's what it looked like from here absolutely he'll always want more regardless of them being ahead now they haven't quite created the chances that he wants them to and he wants them to press harder that's what they're doing now here they come with Bernardo Silva forward to Kevin De Bruyne takes it down to the corner flag tried to dink it back into Bernardo Silva it's blocked away by the next and it will be a Manchester City throw I think it's so interesting I think just before the goal Kevin De Bruyne started going and exploring on the left hand side here's the ball in from De Bruyne won't be Tarland in the penalty area Ake will chest it down hand ball in there by Ake and it will be a free kick to Bayern Karin and as I was saying it you know he's gone to join up with Jack Grealish and as Silva went down that right side just ahead of the goal I mean you were kind of looking for De Bruyne to get joined in but I think was he wondering if I go over here am I going to take someone with me and create some space I think that's exactly what happened for Rodgery and he just went straight through the mid got right on the ball and curled it in still hung up on it Alfonso Davies dispossessed on the halfway line for Bayern Munich gets the interception in as Rodgery plays the ball back and it will be a throw to Manchester City so now it's John Stonestown to get an airfield from Pep Guardiola who's again out of his technical area the poor fourth official I mean he's not chasing it but he's got his arms outstretched and you can almost literally read it from here he's saying Pep come on he's getting the steps in isn't he exactly a couple of steps outside your technical area but Guardiola's halfway down the pitch he's down he's warming up he's warming up get off the pitch getting your technical area Gaffa what are you doing Gatley get a bit on as Bayern Munich play it down the left hand side Kingsley Coman will keep it in switching over to this left wing again Coman taking on Akangy Akangy gets a footing Coman will still retain possession for Bayern Munich who trail by Goltanil here on five live as Davies plays it back to Gretzger and now Delik closed down by Kevin De Bruyne now up in McCarno will play it out to the right hand side but it seems to center by Grealish skips past Ganabri like he wasn't there Grealish feeds Arland central position midway through the Bayern half goes down as found De Bruyne anyway ball ricochets inside the penalty area Grealish pulls it back and Bayern get the interception and will clear the ball but Manchester City all of a sudden yeah looking so dangerous just starting to click now Jack Grealish he's just beating his man with ease De Bruyne is getting on the ball Harlins now looking a little bit more lively and they're just taking control of the game itself Bayern are getting frustrated giving away silly free kicks as well yeah Bernardo Silva the latest to go down on the halfway line and Manchester City who lead by a Goltanil courtesy of that stunner from Rodgery just before the half hour will have this set pieces once again the rain and the wind whips around the Etihad swirling as if a fine mist but it's heavy out there challenging conditions as Akangy plays the ball over the top looking for the run of Gundawan it's just ahead of the Manchester City captain and three with Summit that was a lovely ball from Akangy and we know he's got that in his locker he loves a crossfield dyag we saw him attempted earlier and he got held up in the wind but this trajectory is nice and direct it's just a shame that you know Gundawan isn't the size of Arland and probably not as flexible either because Harlin probably would have taken on the outside of the right foot Chester down by Alfonso Davies pressure by Bernardo Silva and Bayern Munich will send it back to the tyres delicts out to the left hand side they go now with Guretska as Davies has an option Komen's gone in field Guretska uses Davies the Canada fallback taking on Akangy who again stands up well Guretska going to sit back forward to see Arlander edge of the penalty area but Manchester City marshalling well Kimmich's ball over the top though decent one looking for the run of Zane on that far side headed away by Ake and will be picked up by Grealish and field to Gundawan who sends it forward a lovely touch by De Bruyne to Harlin Manchester City really going through the gears now Harlin goes down advantage played by our referee Jesus Gilmanzano Grealish has it on the left hand side central now to Diaz over the halfway line now goes Akangy out to the right and Bernardo Silva Manchester City won by Munich Lille here on five live 12 minutes plus out of time to play Brentford's shock on the cards could England's women being heading for their first defeat under Serena Begum they trail World Cup co-hosts Australia by the goal to Lille it's goalless in the other Champions League quarterfinal between Firm Fika and Inter out to the right hand side Kevin De Bruyne plays the ball into the area little deflection takes it over the head of Harlin and Sommer comes just get something on it brilliant save by Sommer the whistle's gone anyway goodness me what a fantastic stop by Jan Sommer now what's the referee given here initially I thought he might have given the free kick Manchester City have a player down the players are moving into the penalty area so it looks as though the corner might be given then there was no whistle if it is a corner this is a fantastic stop had the second attempt by Sommer huge reaction save as Gunduan follows in Sommer big lift but Karen that's outstanding what an amazing save from I'm sure what the statisticians are going to say in prone position so he's on the floor sticks a leg out and what an instinctual save but I think you know there were some questions around did Jan Sommer you know clip Jack Grealish who's running but to me it was a 50-50 so it is a corner the save needed making as Manchester City swing the ball in it's right across the six yard box still kept alive one quite fall in the area and by Munich do eventually get the ball away with Dias lurking here is Bernardo Silva right hand side dispossessed by Gnabry Dias will play it forward lovely bit of skill Bernardo Silva can only play it into Alfonso Davis Bynes struggling to clear their lines as they play up from the back but in the end it's very calmly done as the cross field ball over to the right hand side is picked up by Leroy Sane formally of Manchester City into the penalty area he goes pulls it back to Kimmich blocked away at the back by Jack Grealish he was back there defending but by Munich still pressing out to the left hand side they go with Mussiala Manchester City leading by Goltaleal and it's the goal scorer Roger who does so well there challenges Mussiala plays the ball off Mussiala it's the Manchester City throw do you understand that listen just in that little 20 second clip there I mean by and what a great cross ball I think it was to Komen and Komen sprinting down the right hand side but you've also got Lee Roy Sane sprinting down the middle of the pitch who's marking him Jack Grealish it just goes to show they're all working for each other so hard long ball over the top someone's come a long way out of this penalty area does win the header that's all he could do with it and bind just about working up to the halfway line out to the left hand side goes Alfonso Davis and now forward to Kingsley Komen receives the ball is challenged by Bernardo Silva is it back to Gretzke central position behind me in midfielder will go back to delict and now forward to Gretzke once more as they exchange passes as Thomas Tuchel stands cap on his head cupping his hands around his mouth shouting instructions the man who got the better of Pep Guardiola with Chelsea beat Manchester City in the Champions League final two years ago only the second manager after Jürgen Klopp to beat Guardiola three times in a row Thomas Tuchel as the ball is out to the right hand side here is Kimmich midway through the Manchester City half nice and interchangeable passes between Gretzke and Missy Arla but Manchester City get the foot in and it's in the way back with the Kanji and now stones will clear out of play Guardiola's furious it's a buy and throw half time England Australia Kelly Summits England 0 Australia won the line-up is 30 match on beat and run is under threat Sam Kerr pouncing after Leo Williamson misjudged a header back to Mary Erdman that's the difference at the break the line-up has had over 70% of possession but just two shots on target plus they lost Lauren Hemp's injury England 0 Australia won thanks Kelly commentary the second half when it gets back under way will continue on five sports extra Manchester City we've won a free kick just inside the bar in half just just I mean Jack's been outstanding Kevin De Bruyne is now finding his feet Pernardo silver on this right hand side is playing against Davies who is a big strong imposing fallback but not as silver's just allowing him to go one-on-one and then Davies is needing help so that means he's going to get a two-on-one that means we've got a spare City player Pernardo silver just sucks players in and leaves space for his teammate and that teammate will often the night is Kevin De Bruyne in and around him eight minutes plus out of time to go in this first half Manchester City leading by Golden Hill have a set piece drifted into the penalty area by De Bruyne well controlled by a Kanji because the wind really picked that up as John Stone swings it to the back post header is made to clear away by buying on the edge of their own six-yard box and then Kingsley Coleman just got a little shove in the back there and it will be a free kick to buy midway through their own half Karen Barton De on how much do you think that little shove in the back of Bernardo silver earlier from Alfonso Davies had a you know a role in this 1v1 duel that we're seeing down the right side from Man City now yeah I think it's it's I think I think it was the little sort of the spot that the game needed they think the fans were happy with definitely the City players were happy with it at all and Bernardo silver he's got a little bit angry now and he's playing even better Manchester City not happy Pep Guardiola to offer that list as Roderick concedes a free kick for what our referee says was a foul on Jamal Maciala the referee is not happy with buying in terms of where they're taking this from not once but twice so they pulled it back inside the centre circle now they get the ball underway Garetska to Maciala can't squeeze it through to Canabri but they will pick it up with Pavar and now Sarnay out on that right hand side up against Acke that's been a real battle they've had Coleman out there on the right now they have Sarnay the former Manchester City player but Acke has done this job very well indeed as they switch back out of possession to this back four with Acke on the right Acke on the left and stones and Diaz in the centre Manchester City here is a for McCona plays it forward to Sarnay lovely term from the former City man now to the left hand side he goes and Kingsley Coleman by looking to get back on level terms before the break in this Champions League called a final tie here is Sarnay 25 yards out good foot in by Roger E will come to Kimmich out to the right hand side he goes Pavar's ball in it's in front of every single red shirt in there but will be collected on this left hand side and Maciala played back to Delix who plays it forward into the area Coleman though is ushered out of the penalty area tries to get past Acanji great challenge by Acanji can see to the corner but he had to get that spot on there and he did yeah I mean they're just they're just probing now buying a little bit of spell spell edge of the box there plays a really nice football buying won't go away they'll keep playing their football goretzka's now actually making an impact in this game as well Coleman and Sarnay have switched so city have just got to be a get over the line till halftime at this scoreline five minutes to play in this first half one nil Manchester City lead by Munich with the corner which they're captain Kimmich will take Coleman's on the move inside the area as Kimmich plays it to the far post cleared away by Manchester City and see Arlow will pick it back up right hand side of the box down to the byline pulls the ball across it's met by Gunduan who clears away there's no sky blue shirt up there to alleviate some of the pressure they were all back defending by Munich will be forced back eventually to the halfway line where Davies goes back to young sommer so Delix has gone down here off the ball play has been stops by our referee by and we're in possession midway through their own half so it's a lick certainly not a player that by Munich would want to have any issues the Netherlands international now he's been so good in the run of form for the in the Bundesliga so far and he's been so consistent and I think he's not really put a foot wrong tonight so you know hopefully he's all right but something interesting I did notice I'm Deanna I don't know if maybe you've picked up on it but I think Sonny perhaps could release the ball a little bit quicker coming through the midfield I think you see obviously you mentioned Coman it switched flanks and he's been up against Akangia I think Akangia's got his number to be honest he's not been terribly effective but what has been interesting is he's coming off the back of Akangia going across the center back occupying that space between either Ruben Diaz and John Stones and trying to force a decision they pulled Akangia in to narrow up and that ball is is so available to to Davies out why but it's just so slow and getting there yeah he does he likes the ball at his feet he likes to see if he can take his opposite number on by that time though he's had two or three switches yeah the ball that was on it has gone and the opening has gone so yeah maybe that's something they'll look at but they are incredibly dangerous in possession they move it well their positions are all interchanging as well by and they're all over the place in regards they're set up they're organized but they know exactly what they're doing hard to mark it's a lot of fluidity yeah without a doubt well Delix is back up to his feet initially he's come over to the technical area and he's down again receiving more treatment as Byron get us back underway the ball is back with Jan Sommer manches the city one Byron Neal Rodri Stunner just before the half hour mark separates the sides Byron still in possession under pressure a little push there from the goal scorer Rodri on Maciala but sends it back to Epimacano and now Sommer who's closed down by the ball now tell you what again manches the city are going to feel that they can get joy out of closing Sommer down that time he did steer it back out to Epimacano he plays it forward won't be controlled by Gnabry and Gundawam will play it forward once more Delix is back on the field of play now having received that treatment so Byron back up to the full complement as we've been D-S comes across and clears away in the left back position momentarily moving out there to De Bruyne and now in field two Jack Grealish good pressure good hassling and harrying from Byron but Manches the city do with it well Manches the city who are in the unusual position if having had 10% less position than their opponents so far in this first half 45% for city 55% for Byron but sitting with the one goal advantage Byron have won it back though just inside the city half of Goretz go out to the left hand side they come now and Kingsley Coleman up against a Kange once more that's developing into a good battle Kange and Coleman with Sane currently taking on Ake on the other side as Delix goes down three kicks given and the 80 howl I think feels that Matias Delix made a rather a meal of that yeah yeah I'm gonna say a three course meal to be honest it was terrible he just jumped in the air Harlem is nowhere near him he knew he couldn't get hold of the ball and he just threw himself in the air embarrassing I saw some acting like that over a Christmas there's a jack in the beanstalk I've seen it at the Olympics on the high board yeah three course meal with after dinner mince as well and coffee to follow as Byron Munich have it just inside their own half all the way back to Janssen we're just going back to the issue that Delix had we did see a replay there was a little coming together between himself and Bernardo Silver nothing in it in terms of the penalty but just a little bit of contact on the the back of heel for Delix but he is back on he's fit enough certainly to get through till half time and Byron I'm sure will make a more in-depth assessment Byron who trail by Eagleton ill 30 seconds plus other time to play in this first half of this Champions League quarter final first leg here on Five Lively reminded we'll be hearing from our commentary team in Madrid he and Dennis and Chris Sutton ahead of our commentary of Real Madrid against Chelsea don't miss it tomorrow evening on Five Lively Kevin De Bruyne and the pressure almost gave the ball away but does enough to put enough venom on the pass to play it off Kingsley Coleman and Manchester City have a throw yeah it's it's it's amazing the way they play with silver wide right and jack wide left I mean they're literally on the on they couldn't get any further on the wings and it just makes the gaps in between the back four really really big for De Bruyne and Gunduan to get into I think that's really interesting sorry to dive in here but we've seen a lot of criticism from Edison early in the year about distribution and I just noticed there that I think they're just getting used to the way that jack is dropping down the line to try and get on the ball and I think Edison obviously expected him to be higher so that relationship obviously we've seen it grow over the course of the season but it's still not quite there is it Karen Pardsley and Dion Tufflin with us here on Five Live we're into two minutes of added time at the end of this first half Manchester City leading by Eagleton ill a candy under pressure from Coleman and Canabria as well so plays it back to Edison who takes the touch and plays it out to this right hand side and John Stones advancing past the red shirts almost of Jamal Masiale but in the end can't get past the youngster so goes back instead to the goalscorer Rodry over the halfway line he goes now plays it forward to De Bruyne who lays it on looking for the run of Gunduan De Bruyne almost picks it up inside the penalty area but sliding challenge will send it out to Leon Goretzka of Byron Munich and Byron's turn to come forward into the final minute of added time at the end of this first half can Byron fashion a chance as they look for a level error as Coleman plays the ball into the area headed away by Ake Goretzka won't reach it on that far side he does eventually get the foot in and Byron will come away with it with Pavar plays it in field two you're a Sarnay goes for goal all with us a fierce strike Edison might have had it covered it bounces just past that far post and a reminder of what the former Manchester City man can do absolutely I mean Sarnay is looking to really take this game by the scruff of the neck and if I'm being completely honest he looks like the only one that's feeling it but something interesting I noticed Vicki was when Kevin Bruyne was progressing the ball down at the other end this just speaks to how clever he is he was using the referee as a screen and I don't know if you guys noticed that but that just speaks to his mentality is intelligence about how he plays how he applies himself half time it still goes at the 80 hands and it is the goal from Rodry the stunner just before the half hour just outside the D killed it into the top corner that is the difference between the two sides and and Dion doubling alongside me it is a half that Manchester City have grown into yeah it is and you know I believe that Byron needed this half as well I think City were growing into the game getting better and better I'm seeing I'm seeing signs of City being a little bit fitter as well out of possession maybe a few of the Byron players don't like the pace at City player and they're finding it difficult to match but what a great game to watch what a great game to watch and Karen Tai still very much in the balance first leg still very much in the balance in terms of the school oh indeed I mean I think to touch on Dion your point around the fitness and I mean Muller in one of his pre-match interviews obviously alluded to the fact that he knew that it was going to be proper graph tonight obviously he's not involved in the starting 11 but I think the team knew that going into this game it was going to be a really really tough one but as soon as that goal went in I think for Manchester City by Rodry they grew in confidence by a few feet and they just really put their foot down didn't they it was the stunner he's first in the Champions League and it's the difference at the break half time at the Etihad Manchester City won by Munich Nill Vicki thank you very much as you say a fantastic goal from Rodry to separate the two sides that did kind of change the game Karen but there was also a little incident between Alfonso Davies and Bernardo Silva that that may just have sparked the City players and the City crowd into life yeah I absolutely think so I think you know he got a real shove in the back from Alonso Davies and I think he just went flying like a ragdoll off the pitch and I think everyone was fuming in the stadium on the pitch I mean Pep Guardiola was going berserk with a fourth official afterwards and you know I think you can tell that this is a team that made business because they were wildly offended I think by that and decided that they were really going to go for it and I think you know what I was impressed by the most was well yeah just as soon as that goal went in it just looked like they really really believed that they're going to take this game to to buy a Munich but look Thomas Tugels no slouch and I know he's going to come out with a few changes and a huge impact in the second half. Quite a few of you getting in touch on social media as well John says Byn will be disappointed to have conceded but looking at their bench they're prepared for this they have a plan B, C and D City can expect an onslaught in the last 30 minutes Nicholas though says while the attacking is otherworldly I've been so impressed with Man City's defence both as a team and one-on-one. We'll be back with our commentary team of Karen Barzyd on Dublin and Vicky Sparks very shortly when the second half gets underway here at the Etihad the other quarterfinal first leg taking place in the Champions League this evening is Benfica against Inter Milan watched by Sohel Sahi. Yeah half-time Kelly Benfica nil Inter Milan nil it's been an impressive start from Inter though they settled the quicker but the first chance Faltar Rafa Silva of Benfica was across from the left hand side and the inter headed clearance Faltar Rafa Silva was on the left hand side of the penalty area and he crashed his shot onto the chest of the Inter goalkeeper Anana Inter responded and they continue to surprise with some fluent and flowing football it's been a good half this Kelly it's been intriguing half-time Benfica nil Inter Milan nil. Sohel thank you very much England's women find themselves in an unusual situation against Australia Kelly Summers. Yeah three minutes of this second half played Kelly it's England nil Australia one as you said England not used to trailing in fact it's the first time Serena Begman has ever had to give a half-time team talk when her side are trailing England have started with a bit more zip a bit more intensity the ball's been completely in the Australia half as Georgia Stanway stands over a free kick around 25 yards out just right of centre I think it's going to be a while till they take it so I'll let you know if they score from it but England better so far at the start of this second half but they trailed by goal to nil Kelly thank you very much Kelly Summers across everything and if you want to listen to commentary it's on five sports extra coming up we're going to round up the rest of the day sports headlines and we'll preview rail Madrid against Chelsea that takes place at the Burnaby with commentary on five live sport tomorrow night and of course second half commentary still to come from here at the Etihad first though it's time for the BBC news with Carl Hartley listen on BBC sounds this is BBC Radio 5 Live.

Chelsea by a further two years Wednesday night on Five Live Sport live commentary of another Champions League quarterfinal first leg Chelsea go to Real Madrid before we bring in the commentary team that will be taking you through that one let's hear from Frank Lampard who spoke earlier on this evening I've been fortunate enough to manage in the Champions League in two seasons and as a player is always the least special competition so to be here as a manager particularly when a week ago today even I didn't know I'll be here is a huge honour for me of course and was you know a big part of the my thought process of you know taking on the challenge here this is an amazing challenge for me personally as well as obviously for us as a as a team and a club I know I've managed in this competition before I know I've managed against big teams in this competition before so I'm not daunted at all in fact I'm more excited than anything um I'm a good favourites yes and I understand why because of the difficulties of our season and those things I don't think that's a problem I think those things are fine there's no better carrot in football than trying to prove people wrong of you know being underdog and never a good result I think it's one of the best things I've been part of that and on both sides actually so I think that's a nice challenge for us so I'm not worried about that and in terms of the pressure I'm not worried about that football at this level is pressure if you can't handle the pressure then you know you're not a big club or you're not a big player or participant in it that was Frank Lampard speaking in Madrid earlier this evening also in Madrid Chris Sutton and Ian Dennis who are your commentary team tomorrow evening we interrupt anything Dano just a little bit yeah you're interrupting our evening meal but uh whilst we've got potatoes fritas I understand that you've got a tonnets chocolate bar alongside your coffee I've got a cup of tea in the tonnets caramel wafer and that bean a glass of ryokha and potatoes braver any day of the week I'll tell you that tell you what that tonnets you take that 89 percentage Scottish with you everywhere should we talk about the football yes should we talk about Frank Lampard and his comment yeah well I believe you've been trying out your Spanish and ordering a mea prendo espanol he's okay Kelly until somebody speaks back in Spanish and then he's in big trouble well look at the espanol poquito poco not poquito so Chelsea against Real Madrid at the bird of bay tomorrow night Frank Lampard almost in his press conference kind of drawing a line under the seasons so far saying I know Real Madrid are a favorite because I've had Chelsea's season has gone so far but he says that that's not a problem that's that's the situation we're in and that's what we'll deal with he also said that both teams are under pressure albeit for different reasons but he was also I think I think he's quite happy in the role of underdog it's quite clear he's got the biggest respect for for Carlo Lancholotti played under him of course at Stanford Bridge when Ligincook double um admires everything about the Real Madrid players in terms of the longevity and what they've achieved and the Champions League success that they've had on a consistent basis but also he was asked a number of questions about leadership and it was interesting that he talked at one stage where he said to be a leader you need to show in action just to show why you are he he believes that they've still got those those players who can perform but the the proof is in the pudding because at the minute despite all the money that Chelsea have thrown at these players to get them to Stanford Bridge they they might be a talented individuals but they are yet to show the collective spirit and despite Enzo Fernandez who also talked to Knight he said we're united as a group they yet to really show that. Chris on those leadership qualities and the and this spirit that's required within the group I wonder if the season that Chelsea have had so far plus a new manager coming in that takes a bit of the heat off them ahead of this game or if it ramps it up even further which way do you see it? I think the pressure is off because of the sacking of Potter and Frank Lampard coming in I mean this this team you look at the individuals within the Chelsea squad they are so so capable but because they have really underperformed in the Premier League I think that the expectation is off them and all the pressure is on around the grid let's get it right nobody expects Chelsea to win the Champions League but you know you look at the money which they've spent and if it all does click goal scoring has been their biggest problem but if it all does click then you know there's no reason why they can't beat Real Madrid over over two legs Real Madrid who were 13 points behind Barcelona in the Liga but we know that they always seem to find a way now you know Frank has to turn the tables and find a way for his Chelsea team to get through this tie and of course there are ties with Carlo Ancelotti who won a Premier League title with Chelsea he was asked whether he's sad to see Chelsea in their current state and if he'd return to help them again I'm sad yes I have a fantastic memory of this club of the people that are still working there and I am a supporter of Chelsea of course because I spent two years really nice there and be back no I think that Lampard I hope that Lampard is able to do a fantastic job with them that was Carlo Ancelotti Denne he's talking with a very relaxed demeanor as we know that Carlo Ancelotti has and this Real Madrid not just this this particular squad but Real Madrid throughout the years have shown that they are more than capable of dealing with the pressure of any big occasion it's not the occasion that's going to be the issue for them it's their form their 13 points behind Barcelona in the league yeah and I get the impression that he probably has to win the Champions League to keep his job do you think yeah I do and that is crazy to say that bearing in mind that obviously he won the Liga last year he won the Champions League last year they've won the club world cup they've won the the away for super cup but the fact is is that he's under pressure he's also been linked to Cali as well with the the national job in Brazil so we'll just have to wait and see where his future lies thank you very much for now Ian Dennis and Chris Sutton back to your dinner sounds delicious all right you don't need to say bye then can you not say that and can you not say that in Spanish Deno I actually said adios a stellar we go a star we go haha speak to you both later looking forward to listening to that tomorrow it's Real Madrid against Chelsea in the Champions League quarterfinal first leg up now though on five live sport is Manchester City against Bayern Munich City 1-0 up from the first half second half coming up with your commentary team of Karen Barthley Dion Dublin and Vicki Sparks thank you Kelly so both sets of players back out on the pitch here at the Etihad and the rain and the wind has lessened slightly so how will the conditions affect this second half it's a game where Manchester City deserve this one goal advantage beautiful goal by Roderick 20 yards out straight into the top corner past Jan Sommer but as we get underway for this second half do you think there'll be a change of approach Karen Barthley for Bayern Munich or will we see them pretty much do what they did in the first half as they look to get back on level terms you know I think they were getting a lot of joy especially down the the flanks you know I saw I'd imagine that we'll keep seeing that service in 1v1's you know especially it was a Kanji and Coleman I think they were getting some joy down there as well to be fair a Kanji's dealt really really well with Coleman coming across but um yeah no I think there we'll see a lot more directness as well here's Gretzger winning the ball for Bayern Munich pays it out to the left hand side Bayern in their home kit the all reds Manchester City in the sky blue as the shot is driven in and saved by Edison Sane letting fly against his former sides Bayern starting this second half with intent trailing as they do by Goltan Hill and Sane Gnabrae turns inside the penalty area and Edison comes flying out and gathers but a real statement of intent Karen Barthley there from Bayern earlier it certainly wasn't I mean it's a direct ball but I mean wow what a strike from Sane I mean he hit that really really nice you know really unorthodox save from Edison he kind of bent down and stuck out like a really strong I think it was his left arm and just a parry it away but yeah still effective Manchester City with the ball inside their own penalty area no changes for either side at halftime so we'll take you through the line-ups in a moment that is Karen Barthley taking one for the team there is Dion Dublin was just finishing off his halftime pie thank you very much for that Vicki cheers you know what it's because I was wondering why you were gesturing so frantically to me and I realized you were always at a half pie in his mouth it was only a mini pie just a mini one I'm here for you Dion thanks Kaz always mate I'm back I'm back Vicki I'm back I'm back you're back you're back and to be fair you ceded the second comment because it was a goalkeeper comment so that's good team play from UD on Dublin thank you very much here on Five Live it's Bayern Munich in position trailing by the Goltan Hill over the halfway line they go by and playing from left to right in this second half Epimacano will send it all the way back to Jan Sommer who was closed down on a couple of occasions dangerously so by Manchester City in the first half without bare fruit for them in this second period Harland indeed almost converting on the goal line after charging down summer as Alio is brought down there by Bernardo Silva on the halfway line now it's a yellow card for Bernardo Silva and it's one of these where I wonder if our referee Jesus Manzano might have wished he'd let that play advantage because Missy Arlo had actually got past Bernardo Silva and was continuing to storm through the Manchester City off. Yeah, Missy Arlo was just striding away I mean Bernardo Silva just got over to Missy Arlo and just give him a bit of shake on the head is it to say sorry about that everybody had to take one for the team there he was away Missy Arlo and he had options as well so technical foul. So Bayern Munich in possession on the halfway line will take you through the line-ups when City are out of possession it's a four but when they're in possession it's a three so that is Edison in goal the back three of Ikanji Diaz and Ake is Bayern breaking towards the penalty area Saneke again good save by Edison and cleared away by Nathan Ake and Rodri will help it out to the right hand side where De Bruyne will pick it up he'll win the free kick as well that might be a yellow card as the referee goes to his pocket and indeed it is so yellow cards all square early on in this first half in the second half as I said the start of this second half Alfonso Davis going into the book for Bayern Munich but in terms of that city line-up completing the midfield then John Stones and Rodri ahead of them De Bruyne and Gunduan with Silva, Grealish and Harland up front to when City are out of possession Stones drops back into centre half and Ake comes out to the right hand side so free kick to Manchester City, Bayern with Sommer in goal the back four of Pava of Himmichano, Delict Davis, Gretzke, Misiala and Kimmich ahead of them Misiala sometimes pushing forward into the 10 as well with Coman, Sane the former City man and Gnabry the former Arsenal player up front as Bayern Dali, Jack Grealish charges the ball down, Sommer will he get there no he won't Grealish urged out of the penalty area, Gunduan cuts it across sloppy by Manchester City not dealing with the sloppiness Bayern Munich has Harland's epitome from Sommer's clearance, Grealish picks it up on the edge of the penalty area, he's just possessed by Kimmichle Coleman oh it was a comedy of errors there from both sides how Manchester City have not stuck that away as Grealish goes down throw to Bayern Munich City had to score the second there what on earth were Bayern doing in the penalty area just so sloppy up in Mekano there getting caught by Jack Grealish then it's a race between Sommer and Jack Grealish and he wins the race he puts into a dangerous area, Bayern don't clear keeper gets caught again shot by Harland is blocked there was a bit of a mess on both parts because City should have scored and Bayern should have cleared it real mess that was from both sides I'm thinking to myself Harland 15 yards out goal great defending though bodies on the line yeah it's a weird one it just goes to show you you know like what hesitate hesitancy can do to a side you know I don't know if I'm from Mekano didn't realize it that Jack Grealish was that close but yeah really really uncharacteristic mistake I think from Bayern Munich and boy are they lucky to get away with that well Grealish is still down receiving treatment but it's exactly what we said at the start of the second half but but usually it's Sommer in the first half that was closed down there it was the whole bind defend yeah they just they're just playing too slow they've got to know that City are not going to allow them that kind of that kind of space and time Jack Grealish it was on this occasion as soon as Jack went Harland went De Bruyne went silver went and they all went in behind Jack I'm glad he's up on his feet now Jack was down getting some treatment he's up on his feet he's walked off he's okay but they've got to be careful by not to play too slow yeah he's ready to come on Grealish and does come back on so goal is here in this Champions League called it's goalless Manchester City lead by Golden Hill in this Champions League called a final first leg here on five live as Bayern Munich have the ball just outside their own penalty area here is a Pemekana plays it forward it's a ball it's intercepted by the City goal scorer Rodri and now Harland playing the ball forward blocked by Kimmich who blocked that Harland effort a few moments ago inside the penalty area as Bayern Munich once again play their way out of trouble they're taking risk doing it but they are able to do it but it's that final ball as they get near the halfway line that is given away by a Pemekana and John Stones will pick it up and send it back to the Kange and now Diaz has been a goal in the other Champions League called a final Sahel Sahi and it's gone to the visitors into Malakviki they lead Benfica by Golden Hill a deep cross from the left hand side from Bustoni and Barela was gliding in at the far post and he's stuck it away a lovely header Benfica now into Milan one thanks Sahel Manchester City with the goal advantage here at the Etihad on five live eight minutes gone in this second half England's women still trailing Australia by a Golden Hill the long unbeaten run under Serena Begman they've never lost under her under threat all those out of play for a throw to Bayern Munich Karen Bosnick I love how clever Harland is he's just realized that up on Mekano has had an absolute stinker for two three minutes and he's gone and just targeted him he's just marking on him and here he comes now as the ball is intercepted well by Delict but excellent spot Karen that's exactly what Harland's doing and again it speaks to the intelligence of the runners Bayern Munich played over the top looking for the run of Gnabry headed away by Diaz it's a poor header though Gnabry latches onto it Stones is there to help out his centre half partner and Nathan Ake now up against Coman he picks it up for Bayern Munich and peels the ball and had a play official says no and Sane will drive and Edison beats the ball away well Sane's got a shooting boots on in this second half the former City man 20 yards out you'd expect Edison to make the save but it's still a good one it's a great strike as well Sane now on site 25 yards out on the angle anywhere at all he's striking the ball and he sort of strikes it from the bottom up so it bends and it and the keepers can't even see where it's going to go you can't have to gamble as a keeper surely oh Dion those are terrible obviously there's no kind of spin but there's so much movement and especially on a night like this with a soaking wet pitch and it's sorely wind about that ball can go anywhere Coman picks it up on this right hand side for Bayern Munich looking to get back on level terms for bar into the penalty area little deflection made it very difficult for Edison off Diaz tips it over the bar all that's one of those that could have looped over the Manchester City goalkeeper but he did well it's a buying corner you know Jack Grealish getting back and helping out his defenders well he got a massive high five from Diaz I mean it's a court he did give a corner away but the way that they defend together is absolutely fantastic there was a lovely bit of coming together between Coman and Grealish look out for that one yeah good spot D and it was Grealish that got the deflection as the ball is swung in brilliant header cleared away by Manchester City not once but twice goodness me what defending Diaz with the second clearance right off the goal line it's behind for another Bayern Munich corner two headers coming so close for the German side and it's great defending from Ackie great positional play in terms of his awareness of what's around him he's brave he gets his head on it so Bayern prepare to take second corner and quick succession swung in again again dangerous ball Rodry heads it away this time backing by Kimmich flicks on and Edison should claim and does inside his six-yard box as the ball is cleared long by Edison and De Bruyne is on the chase and Sommer had to get that clearance right when he did oh nervy moments for goalkeepers there Karen Parsley as Gunduan goes down free kick on the halfway line to City Karen thoughts in a moment but a goal at Brimford England Australia Kelly Summers do not suggest your radio it is England nil Australia to a lovely quick passing move from the Matilda's has ended with Sam Kirk crossing deep into the box she picked out Charlotte Grant whose header deflected wickedly off Lear Williamson to wrong foot Mary Erps and double the visitors lead England 30 much on beaten run very much under threat 20 minutes remain England nil Australia to thanks Kelly commentary continues over on five sports extra Scotland to have an hour four nil up in their friendly with Costa Rica here at the Etihad Manchester City leads by a golden ill but that lead preserved by some brilliant defending first by a key from delix header and then by Ruben Diaz clearing off the goal line by Munich knocking at the door early on in this second half as the interception is made on the far side by a Kanji who's bursting down that right hand side for Manchester City pulls it back in field to their goal scorer Roger E Square now to Kundo and 20 yards down a little bit of space Dings it left to Grealish instead Grealish just outside the area back here to Ake Ake drives and beaten away by summer for a Manchester City corner Ake drives but he should have gone across the keeper Kaz when when you're like that on the angle you've got to go across the keeper you never know where the keeper's going to parry it went me opposed wrong decision no no he's he's someone's done well to make it as predictable as possible for him the angle he takes up off Ake but yeah that was poor from Ake so corner to Manchester City Kevin De Bruyne is over this plays it short to the edge of the penalty area Byron have switched off Grealish lays it off to Gundo and just outside the D back to De Bruyne now swings the ball in just down in the area what a save by summer absolutely outstanding from the Byron Munich goalkeeper Manchester City are inquiring as to whether there was a foul in there but the referee says no it will be a city corner Karen Bardley that's an outstanding start oh my goodness the goalkeepers I'm absolutely loving this second half already you know we're seeing an Edison counterattack into a summer header you know we're seeing fantastic saves over the crossbar but I mean how about Bernardo Silva bringing that down to his chest what composure six yards off from goals fantastic out to the right hand side this corner will be taken swung to the far post by another player down and the referee has spotted it as stone since the ball across goal and it will be a free kick to Byron Munich inside the round penalty area well Deion what a start to this second half it could be two two it could be three two yeah it could be both sides are completely going for this they really are Kimmich went down just there but the referee's just saying that you injured or you know he's up on his feet and they're moving again but Byron know that if they switch off any more City of Ferry so many players forward into the box that they will score again and they've been very very positive everything's going through the centre of the pitch at the moment through De Boerner Harlan and again the pressure being put on Jan Sommer the Byron goalkeeper that time by Grealish the clearance is out of play and Akkanji will take this throw for Manchester City City who are unbeaten in their last 24 Champions League home games you have to go all the way back to the loss against Leon in September 2018 they lead by a goal to kneel here if they avoid defeat they'll set a new English club record of 25 Champions League home games and beaten in a row is Byron Munich again with Sarno to the edge of the area Eddison comes out very quickly and clears away Delix will send it back to Sommer but Deion and Karen you both said in the first half Sarno is looking like the player who can haul Byron back into this time yeah I think his left foot at the moment is absolutely on fire he's striking the ball so well and you can't give him any time at all and in and around the City's box he hit the target he has done three times already and Eddison's been equal to it here goes Gundawan down the left hand side nice little back heel to find Jack Grealish from Manchester City who goes all the way back to Nathan Ake square now to Ruben Diaz and now the goal scorer Rodgerie knew that he was being closed down by Missy Arles so goes back to Ake and now Diaz wants more as Manchester City slot into that back three here is Harland looking to score his 45th goal of the season City working out to the right hand side here is Bernardo Silva has the options in the box Harland is one of them in that central position but Bernardo Silva has two by players with him and he gets past them both brilliantly into the penalty area he goes in the end Davies recovers well down by the buy line but Silva's won it back just inside the area tries to pull it back the shot is driven across goal they're appealing for the corner it's gone the other way and in the end the referee changes his mind so it will be a throw to Manchester City just bounced off the corner flag so did go out for a throw initially it was given to Bayern but it's much too Benjamin Pavel's disappointment it will be a throw to Manchester City and Jack Grealish is being told by the referee to take it right down by the corner flag where it did bounce out but again lovely move from City yeah Bernardo Silva down the right hand side I mean he's got Davies who's bigger than him his Gretzka came over to to double up on Silva but he's that clever his body language is left and then it's right and they just can't deal with his movement he gets by two players City have squandered the throw but one possession back Harland on the edge of the area Bayern get the foot in sliding in his Grealish Rodgerie now to De Bruyne great vision looking for Bernardo Silva but well read by Davies and Davies will bring it away the Canada football back had his disc possessed by De Bruyne and now here comes Bernardo Silva back to De Bruyne plays it in early looking for Harland cleared away by Epermikano, Acangio will win the head of Manchester City sent it out to the right hand side and De Bruyne exchanges passes with the goal scorer Rodgerie and now Acangio under pressure goes all the way back to Diaz who will send it all the way back to his goalkeeper Edison yeah you know we sometimes describe players as I've got a great engine I think Kevin De Bruyne has got two engines I just don't know how he gets around the pitch so quickly so smoothly and so effectively every time he gets the ball here he is again slides the ball to Harland in the penalty area forced to the right hand side of the box pulls it back to Rodgerie looking for the run of Grealish on the left hand side cleared away by Pavar almost falls to Acke Grealish then gets involved and wins it back for Manchester City who lead here on five lies by a goal to nil 16 minutes gone in this second half here is Rodgerie who scored that goal a stunner just outside the D top corner just before the half hour mark out to the right hand side now and Bernardo Silva finds De Bruyne back to Bernardo Silva hugging that right hand touch line all the way back to Acangio and feels to Rodgerie now but this is where Karen Manchester City just settled into their rhythm and it's exhausting for five yeah it really is you can see the overloads happening particularly on City's right hand side in a stone John Stonest has taken a really advanced position through the midfield but now he's coming across a big shift from him to go and connect play to try and build up with Grealish and Acke and Ruben Diaz but yeah you're absolutely right Vicki they're just probing and probing and trying to find that weakness that moment when Byron Munich just switch off to attack and here they come again down the right hand side as the rain begins to team down once more in Manchester Bernardo Silva lays it off to Kevin De Bruyne Rodgerie's making the run here he is Rodgerie just outside the area well intercepted by Gretzger for Byron and now forward to Kingsley Coman he's over the halfway line Stones is there with him Coman goes out to the left hand side and Sane who's stung the palms of Edison a few times in this second half now Masiala lays it off as Kimmich will have a drive blocked away by Diaz just inside the area just a down by De Bruyne and now picked up by Grealish plays about to Acke who thinks it very cutely out to this left outside that's brilliantly done by De Bruyne keeps it in can't quite find Grealish and Kimmich has it once more to Gretzger and Byron go all the way back into their own half now Kevin De Bruyne is down off the pitch so play continues Manchester City medical staff are already over to the Belgium now the ball goes out of play there's no reason here for the referee to stop play because De Bruyne is off the pitch but this will be a concern Deom yeah it will be and I mean I've been saying this for a long time I didn't see the way he fell but I'm pretty much guarantee that oh it's his knee it's his knees his studs get caught in the ground his groin opens up his knee opens up really awkward fall his left leg sliding off the pitch his right leg is on the pitch his studs are caught in the ground but like the machine he is is up on his feet again yeah he is he's been helped up to his feet City want Byron to put the ball out but there's no real reason to do so you have to say from Byron's perspective De Bruyne wants to come back on there's no stopper in play yet Guardiola is down on his knees in this technical area watching on because Byron are looking to take advantage with City temporarily down to 10 players now De Bruyne is weighed back on so they're back up to the full complement and Byron Munich have it over on the left hand side Manchester City lead by Goltin and then Guardiola's got up off his knees standing with his hands on his hips Byron Munich in possession on the half-way line lovely turn by Missy Arla plays it forwards will be chased by Alfonso Davies but he won't be able to keep it in did it get a little deflection on the way through Well Byron certainly feel it did Manchester City are asking the question but it will be the corner kick to Byron Munich right in front of that little away contingent there across all three tiers that little section the red banners and shirts in there looking as their side look to get back on level terms corner swung high to the far post and Edison got something on it and punches it behind and he needed to because De Licta is coming in like a train he really was De Licta had an eye for that right at the back post and Edison did just enough to kind of just shape the ball into a really really safe area and just kind of clear the danger and give the team time to reorganize so corner to Byron to be taken from this right hand side by Sane swings it in low it's cleared away by De Bruyne who looks to be moving pretty freely I mean it was one of those where he goes down to you and you think oh he could have done some serious damage there but sometimes yeah sometimes you're fighting yourself and you think have I done something here let me just stay still and move back to Muffy slowly he's he's got back to his feet gingerly but he's okay Kim making possession for Byron Munich just outside the centre circle Manchester City leads by a Golden Hill midway through this second half reminder to join us for commentary tomorrow of Real Madrid against Chelsea into Milan are currently leading up and Fika by Golden Hill in the Knights other champions league quarterfinal first leg England's women are training Australia by two goals to know commentary over on five sports six of that one is De Bruyne picks it up bursting towards the penalty area to three players to stop him De Bruyne really stayed down Byron Munich will bring the ball away De Bruyne is now just gingerly getting up to his feet but that's it anytime he goes down now all of the eyes of the Etihad are on Kevin De Bruyne here is Kimmick in possession for Byron Munich because substitutions potentially being prepared for Manchester City and Alvarez is preparing to come on and you just think they're not going to take any more chances with De Bruyne surely I wouldn't have thought so he's been down a couple of times and he looked like he's hurt but he's been okay but why not out to the left hand side go by and ball into the penalty area just about cleared away by Grealish as it spun out to the right hand side however I will collect as the full goes out for a throw to Byron Munich so here is Hylian Alvarez let's see if it is De Bruyne who comes off or whether Guardiola is going to try something different no it's straightforward you can accuse Peper of overthinking but no overthinking there De Bruyne clearly struggling off he goes Hylian Alvarez is on yeah and you know what I think the manager is absolutely spot on he's had a few niggles he's fell in a certain way he's absolutely livid Kevin De Bruyne is not happy at all sort of throwing his arm in the air I have to say why are you taking me off but the manager's just protecting the best player that he has but De Bruyne is not happy at all yes interesting how do you read that Karen because is that frustration at Guardiola is that frustration at the situation I think it's probably the situation because I probably feel like he was just kind of getting into his groove a little bit especially in the first half I think he had those really really great moments and I think he was hoping for a few more he hasn't been involved as involved as much as I think he would have liked so far in the second half so yeah ultimately I think he's just frustrated with the situation on the whole here comes the pomecano for Byn Munich cleared away by Manchester City but Goretzka will pick it up and send it out to the right hand side with Komen ball into the area and the header is allowed to go behind by Edison but they're getting closer with his Benjamin Pavar there on the edge of the six-yard box as Byn Munich prepare to make a change and it is Sadio Mane who gets a big double hand on the shoulders from Thomas Tuchel as he prefers to come on to replace Jamal Zila yeah it's uh yeah danger Sadio Mane danger now he is a man that will put himself in gold scoring positions and he'll be able to score you know something out of nothing he's that kind of player we've seen him we've seen him firsthand in the Premier League we know how good he is we've got to stop the supply to Sadio Mane Komen Komen now is going to be a joy down the right sonny down the left so work harder I think the key is Delet wins the header at the back for Byn just outside the penalty area yes he has 11 goals for the season Mane a season which has been disrupted by injury missed the World Cup of course with Senegal but has gone in 11 games without scoring into October the last time he found the back of the net back here from Queen List beautiful Harland into the penalty area pulls the ball across there is the header from Bernardo Silva and there is the second goal for Manchester City they slice by Munich apart and take a grip on this Champions League quarterfinal two City 2 by Munich Nils what are they doing in defense I think he was up in the corner again trying to play out wanted too much time on the ball it was Jack Gleelish again that put him under pressure you've got to learn your lesson Jack Gleelish nicked it off him back here into Harland I'm thinking Harland has got to shoot no he doesn't he just lifts it over to the far post I'm thinking who's there Bernardo Silva comes from nowhere a bullet header right past the keeper keepers got no chance even with a header from Silva keepers got no chance great vision great hard work great brilliant goal by City I love the fact that there was a little back heel as well and I think that was was that from Jack no was that from Jack Gleelish yeah it was and just the awareness of Harland to understand that there was just a little dink pass and the header from Bernardo Silva was just phenomenal what a low driven header who needs Kevin De Bruyne with a sis like that beautiful from Harland's clinical from Bernardo Silva so much power generated on that header and Manchester City lead by Munich by two goals to nil midway through this second half Pep Guardiola out of his technical area wants more but both sides do and have had chances in this second half but a key a key second goal for Manchester City as Sommer has it on the edge of his own six yeah I think it's just that ruthless edge that City have when they get a chance they do try to make sure they put it on the back of the net they've given the ball away again Apamecano really struggling comes to Gundel an into the penalty area goes for the one two Apamecano gets the foot in Gleelish now will curl it to the backstick Silva's there again good header by Davies but by Munich are rocking at the moment and Apamecano's confidence is absolutely shocked yeah he's shot and all the City players seem to be wanting to find Silva in the air now that's how good he's doing Jack Gleel is trying to find him at the far post good defending but City are really really going for the throat now corner out swinging an owl this time they lead two nil Manchester City can they find the third Harland is in there making their onto the near post as the corner is swung high it's headed away by Bayern Munich comes out to Jack Gleelish left hand side of the penalty area who steers it back to Gundel an and now Bernardo Silva just inside the Bayern half Silva who's got the second goal in the second half for Manchester City as the ball is swung in high comes almost all the way through will be controlled by Diaz who just had to keep it in on the bar line pulls it back and somewhere will claim indeed Diaz wasn't able to keep it in and it will be a goal kick to Bayern Munich who are reeling at the moment defensively they had the best defense in the Champions League coming into this match you can see the just two goals in the entire competition they conceded two goals here at the Etihad here on five live after that second goal went in incidentally there were some scuffles in the crowd over in the Bayern Munich ends some of the Manchester City fans as the header is all the way back by Rodgerie from outside his own penalty area to Edison Karen Barton I love to see it I love when a team is on the exact same page you know exactly what needs to happen Rodgerie is tracking back obviously a ball in the air comes to when he knows look I'm just going to head this back to Eddie he's going to be ready so Edison inside his own penalty area as Manchester City play around the Bayern Munich press so in terms of the formation for Bayern Gennabry had slotted in just behind Sadio Mane so he got Coman on the right Sani on the left as Edison wants more takes the ball inside his own penalty area and Manchester City working out to the right hand side in the Kanji he plays the ball off Leroy Sani and it will be a throw to Manchester City midway through their own half Thomas Tickle stands arms folded on the edge of his technical area what does he do now see on he's such an experienced manager Champions League winner of course getting the better of Pep Guardiola with Chelsea two years ago in the final house he get back into this tie against me I mean he can't he can't rush into anything he's got to have to have to pick the right place to come I think Sadio Mane is definitely one that he has to get on the pitch I'm sure that Mulder will find his way on the pitch at some stage to try and settle things down but they just have to move the ball quicker by and they're so slow at the back moving the ball they play right into City's hands and they're coming over the halfway line Manchester City with Nathan Ake out to the left hand side and Jack Grealish City leading by two goals to nil here on five live Grealish left hand side of the penalty area laid off now by Rodry who got things underway in the first half Gundawan to Grealish edge of the box plays it in Harland still edge of the penalty area tries to find Alvarez just loses control play continues Gundawan left hand side of the six-shot box pulls it back Alvarez trying to pick his spot Summer makes the save cleared away by Alfonso Davis by and we're asking the question could that have been a free kick in there we played on it's out of play for a Manchester City throw and again what a huge opportunity to get another goal for Manchester City Summer has been absolutely outstanding tonight he does so so well to change direction and get set as quickly as possible and then he takes a leg out to his left and just gets a hand as quickly as he can as fast as he can down to make that save and to parry it into a safe area that's nestling in the back of the net it's a great effort from Alvarez he's just passing it into the corner from eight yards out Summer just shifts his feet from underneath him and just palms it into a safe area what to say corner to Manchester City they lead two nil headed away by Delict who beats Harland to the ball here is Bernardo Silva back out to the right hand side he goes as Manchester City look to keep up the pressure Stones is in their heads across Harland and that is what he does so well the predatory finish on the angle from close range and Erling Harland makes it three nil to Manchester City against fine Munich 45 goals for the season the most that any Premier League player has scored across all competitions in a single campaign this man is quite simply the best in the world at this moment Manchester City three by Munich nil it was only a matter of time when is he gonna crop up he's done so much work for the players tonight Harland he's set players he's crossed the ball for Silva he's got himself on the score sheet as well the fans love him it's a little tapping at the bar post little right foot volley from four yards on the angle summer comes out but he puts it across him keepers got no chance I think it might be stones that heads the ball down that was a brilliant goal a great team goal and he was never going to be off the score sheet when City scored three goals yeah it was too easy for Silva to get that ball in and it was just far too easy to get John Stones on the end of that back post header to get the ball across for Harland just to tap home but I mean wow they're really capitalizing some bad runner form from up in Meccano and just kind of some drop in momentum from Bayern Munich and I have to be honest it's pretty great to see. Bayern Munich under pressure again, put Meccano closed down by Grilich and Somert clears over the halfway line he'd hit a one by Stones but Bayern Munich will send it forward once again Canabri can they get a goal back Sanez and they're Canabri still going excellent challenge at the back by Ruben Diaz big high fives amongst the Manchester City defence and City are coming forward once more looking to add to this three goal advantage and completely rest this tie away from Bayern Munich as the ball is swung into the area by Grilich cleared away by Bayern Munich Harland there was there a foul referee says yes and it will be a free kick to Bayern but just going back to that goal Karen you just know he's going to be there you do I mean it's a brilliant header by Stones but no but you do all you got to do is put it back across the face of the goal because you know like he's so predatory you guys have said it yourself in the commentary like he just frames the six yard box right he frames the win to the goal you know exactly where he's going to be so just put it across there and he'll find a way to tap it home. 12 minutes plus out of time to play but there is a celebratory feel around the itty-haz and they've stolen possession again Manchester City Bayern Munich really rocking a canji into the area great save by someone once again punching away a canji's cross and Bayern Munich clear they just need to get a grip of themselves there Bayern they almost give the ball away again Kimmich will play it back to the lick Harland's head down is pursuing a bonzo Davies out on that left hand side and Thomas Tuchel is sending on the experience of Thomas Muller because that's what they need to be on they need experience they need to calm down here as Edison makes the save from Leroy Sane on the edge of the area flag had gone up anyway we play on as Manchester City are in possession Bayern fans away to my right defiantly holding those red and white scarves in the air as Manchester City play the ball up to halfway advantage played Grealish decided he didn't want the advantage so in the end our referee Jesus Manzano gives the free kick and now Jack Grealish is having a little exchange with Thomas Tuchel who was telling Grealish to get up there as Bayern prepared to make what will be a double change Thomas Muller is on for Serge Gennabry and now let's see what reception comes on here well they put number 23 up which is daily blitz the football Manchester United man but it is Wow Cancelo the Manchester City lonely that is coming on and Alfonso Davies is coming up what kind of response is that I'm not quite sure is it booze is it I don't think it helped that they put up number 23 but it's the same time exactly so they might have been thinking they were booing daily with the former Manchester United man so who knows but it is Cancelo on Manchester City in possession outside their own penalty area leading by three goals to do we should say there was no option for Manchester City to say in the contracts the loan that Greal Cancelo is going on in terms of Bayern Munich there was no option to say look you can't play him that you wait for rules you can't do that so he has to be available and Bayern Munich in possession here is a pomegranate we'll be heading to Ben Fieger shortly into were leading by golton they'll last we heard but Bayern pushing towards the Manchester City penalty area here is Kimmich send it back to the halfway line I think they've realised it is Greal Cancelo and he is getting booed from some of the Etihad crowd as Sanio Mane won't latch on to that for Bayern and Erling Haaland has it once more picked up by Julian Alvarez halfway line plays it out to the right hand side and Haaland who has his 45th goal of the season and as Manchester City send it all the way back to John Stones just inside the city penalty area plays it forward to Gundewan has it once more City midway through their own half leading by three goals to nil let's head for an update from that match Ben Fieger into Sahel Saarheim and into Milan Vicky have scored a second goal from the penalty spot as Ben Fieger nil into Milan to Robin Lulee-Cacons come on as the second half substitute has rolled the ball in for a third Champions League goal of the season it was a hand ball driving from distance just past the far post of Manchester City looking the mood for a fourth thanks Sahel that is just incredible Jack Greenish a lovely little header from Akke onto Jack Greenish Jack Greenish is stood in front of his manager on the halfway line he takes his opposite number one and he just lays it into Alvarez 25 yards out he thinks well why not I want to get on the score sheet 25 yards out tries a bit of dip with a bit of serve doesn't hit the target but I think he might have beaten the keeper if it was no it was a whisker away a whisker away from the World Cup winner but it remains Manchester City 3 by and Munich Neal so yes just to confirm into Milan 2-0 up near first leg away to Ben Fieger commentary remember on five live tomorrow evening Braille Madrid against Chelsea do join us with the Indianis and Chris Slutton but here at the Yeti had Karen it has turned with seven minutes plus other times of play into a very satisfactory evening for Pep Guardiola and Manchester City it certainly has it's quite a contrast the two managers I see down here in front of me I'm pep you know just looks like he just wants more and more and more and Thomas Tugol looks so infuriated you know he's just like doing pirouettes of frustration down on the touch line and I'm not sure you know how much impact Thomas Müller and Cancello are going to have you know there's just not really enough time to really make that much of an impact and I think what we saw from Sarnay was exciting for a few moments here he goes trying to race through the middle he's there with stones he pushes the ball back to Edison again the flag was up on the far side like that double thumbs up from the referee to the linesman over on the far side playing advantage but it'll stop it now because stones has just pulled up with a slight issue so play stops to make sure that stones doesn't need to receive treatment and we can head for full time at Brentford is England's long unbeaten run under Serena Begman over Kelly Summers it is they're saying we want Vicki Sparks back the 30 match unbeaten run comes to an end England nil Australia 2 Sam Kerr's first half strike plus Charlotte Grant's deflected header in the second I mean Serena Begman tastes defeat for the first time as Lionesses boss with 100 games to go until the World Cup 10th ranks in the world Australia were solid and really lethal on the break punishing a pretty uncharacteristically lethargic lionesses England nil Australia 2 thanks Kelly and it has finished four nil to Scotland in their women's friendly with Costa Rica so not the best preparation for England who won the phenolism of course at Wembley against Brazil last week but to lose that unbeaten run to lose that momentum right before the World Cup not ideal for the European champions who will be one of the big favourites of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand this summer ball goes out of play for a throw to Manchester City and Pep Guardiola is not too happy there is that with the ball boy it's not too impressed yeah maybe the ball through the ball back too quickly it's all flowing I've told you before do it slower so throw to Manchester City five minutes plus added time to play Nathan Ackett takes it up towards Erling Harland okay then tries to play it off Kimmich but can't do so and it will be a throw to Bayern Munich in terms of plays making an impact I mean Sadio Mane was brought on with plenty of time to do so but he's been anonymous yeah he's not had a touch as he's not had a chance and again Bayern playing themselves into trouble that back pass too strong for Jan Summer. It's amazing how confidence can drain out of a play because that unfortunately is what we've seen happen with Daioh Pramikana the France international could it be costly even more costly than it has been for Bayern already they've really been masters of their own downfall in the second half they trail by three goals to nil Manchester City corner swung in looking for Rodry oh what a save by Summer Rodry's header 12 yards out Summer on the stretch and the irony Karen Bardzny is is that even though Manchester City lead by three goals to nil Summer's got a shadow being player of the match what a header what a fantastic header from Rodry and somehow Summer just defies gravity just float in the air and get two hands to that and just tip it over the crossbar what a fantastic save brilliant stop as Manchester City swing the corner in again now they're claiming for a penalty the whistle is gone the freekits gone the way Bayern Munich there's no way the referee is going to let them take it from their edge of their own area it's been very hot on that our referee but that we are underway so the AR either had a quick check a lot of time to check for the handball because once you restart can't call it back but still Bayern Munich very much up against it not just on the night but in the tie second leg in Germany to come next week but Manchester City have taken a real stranglehold of this encounter as Paavard out of frustration chops down Grealish and is into the book I wonder if Jack Grealish ever counts as bruises so you must have a lot just a little bit of pushing and shoving between the players the referee just giving Joshua Kimmich a push on his way as well I think you're right Vicky I think what it was I think I think it might have been Kimmich that was leaning over Jack Grealish as if to say get up the boys heard what he was saying they weren't happy with him at all so Diaz pushed him out the way and Akin Kaiman as well looking after their teammate so two minutes plus had a time to play and a very contented S.E.H.A.D. it will be nine wins in a row in all competitions for Pep Guardiola's Manchester City it's their best run of form this season it might add to their three goals here is John Stones out on the right wing has Harland in the centre was about to Bernardo Silver he licks the ball crossfield to Grealish tries the curler from just outside the penalty area but it's over the angle of post and ball some beautiful passing within that little passage you play there Bernardo Silver's pinging to John Stones and John Stones passes it back and they just pass the ball with the right weight and the nice crossfield ball there to Jack Grealish try to curl it in the corner obviously City are in control of this game when it comes to to goals but I think they've drained all the energy out of Bayern tonight Bayern playing the game at one pace unfortunately City play the game at a different pace and it's a lot faster Ape McCarno out to the right hand side in Pavar Bayern Munich struggling to get out of their own half at the moment trailing by three goals to Niel and Karen Barzley former Manchester City and England goalkeeper alongside us you know we praised Jan Sommer but Edison made some key saves at one nail as well that then allowed Manchester City wants Bernardo Silver headed in to build to what will be this victory in the second half oh yeah absolutely uh Edison was fantastic especially the very early start of that second half I think City came out a bit lethargic Bayern Munich had obviously had a real good talking to at halftime and Sane looked like he was really really up for I think Dion said that you know we saw three opportunities in relatively quick succession and without that I think yeah I mean this could have been a different ball game here goes Raul Cancelo the booing in he might mistake it for shoot the block is made by Akangy the online Manchester City man and out to the left hand side the ball goes throw to Bayern Munich if they could get a goal back it would really change the complexion of this time because at the moment there is very little hope for Thomas Tuchel's side still the second leg to come we know we've seen remarkable games in Europe they're not out of it yet but at three nil down it's fingertips stuff and serves a clinging on a goal back could change that into three minutes of out of time at the end of this second half Manchester City lead by the three goals as Mane brings it down for Bayern Munich out to the right hand side now and Kingsley Coleman plays it back to Kimmich 25 yards out plays it in field to delict out to the left hand side City all of a sudden dropping Divas Cancelo swings the ball in it's headed away at the back by Ruben Diaz will come out to Cancelo again on the left hand side again the booze for the on-load Manchester City man played in field now to Kimmich this is Bayern's longest fellow possession in the second half what can they do with it as time ticks away here is Coleman drips the ball into the penalty area the header down is eventually keyed away by Nathan Ackers Coleman was rushing in header is won by a Prima Cano and now Giacome Cancelo has it once more it's Manchester City send the sky blue shirts up to the halfway line we've played one minute of the minimum three added on Manchester City three Bayern Munich nil here on BBC Radio 5 Live at the Etihad now to the right hand side go by Munich what to have a forward to Coleman has the option ahead of him of Thomas Muller brought on in the second half can he make an impact by a man through and through he's inside the penalty area Muller falls wide out to the right hand side Pava will get the cross in and it's straight into the arms of Edison and Karen Barley is that sort of time where you drop straight to the ground 56 yards box it's wasting time time yeah absolutely just takes the enthusiasm out of the Bayern Munich attack doesn't it I think everyone in the stadium everyone on the pitch knows that this game is well and truly in city's control and it's going to be exciting to take them to that second leg for sure ball is keyed away by Edison over the halfway line Harlem will chase young someone should get them in collect by Munich fans away to our right have unveiled a banner that says shake man saw out it's right next to the city fans now we've seen protests in Germany we saw them through the World Cup about human rights it's something that happens a lot in Germany and Bayern Munich fans have come prepared to unveil a banner against the Manchester City owner who is the deputy prime minister of course as well as being city's owner of the United Arab Emirates Bayern Munich come forwards once more with Sadio Maneu plays it to the right hand side and Thomas Miller pulls the ball across excellent sliding intersection by Nathan Akke Manchester City looking to close out this clean sheet and this three-nil victory in this Champions League quarter final first leg as the ball is out to the right hand side picked up by Bayern and a Pumacano they're all pushing forward the red shirts now we're into the final 20 seconds ball into the penalty area cleared away once more by Akke really gets the distance on it and that should be that that is that for Manchester City a resounding first leg win in their quarter final against Bayern Munich handshakes all around between Pep Guardiola and the coaching staff of his former club but this is huge for Manchester City and they're pursuits to win the Champions League for the very first time more records fall for Erling Harlins and Manchester City Karin Barzill Dion Dublin have such a grasp now of this Champions League time they really really do I mean what a fantastic performance from this Manchester Manchester City side I mean Bayern Munich just looked like they ran out of ideas especially what Dion I don't know 15 minutes into the second half this looked like they weren't getting any joy Edison wasn't giving them anything we had some really fantastic defending from a canji Reuben Diaz Akke they're all solid tonight end-to-end stuff from Jack Grealish and John Stones giving it his all I mean just some fantastic performances and obviously some goals some fantastic goals I just think you know we know City can score goals we know they're great going forward we've got all the flair and all the goal you need to create as many chances as possible they show a different side tonight everybody mocks him when it comes to defending John Stones outstanding Diaz outstanding a canji and Akke as well outstanding I just feel that all the sky blue shirts out there played their part not outstanding but to put away a Bayern team 3-0 like they did a Bayern team let's not forget we hadn't succeeded in two games against Dintor two games against Barcelona two games against PSG tonight they've conceded more goals than they have in their previous eight matches in this Champions League campaign and as you say the clean sheet such a boon for Manchester City as well they have a real stranglehold on this quarter final tie it finishes after the first leg in Manchester Manchester City 3 five minutes lots more with Vicki Sparks Deon Dublin coming up coming up very very shortly as we reflect on this game between Manchester City really impressive win over Bayern Munich we'll be hearing from the guys we hear from Karen Bardley and we'll be hearing from you on social media City favorites for the Champions League this year from me says Mark Harland he thinks has been missing piece of the puzzle Daniel though picks out Jack Grealis saying he might not have the goal or the assist but the contribution has been massive tonight Nick says for all the quality have been really really impressed by Ruben D as a superb player but Richard points out outstanding play by every single one of City's players tonight not a single weakness on the pitch he says from anyone in blue as I said we'll have lots more from all the guys here from Karen from Deon and from Vicki it's all over or it's nearly all over between Ben Fika and Inter Milan Sahel Sahi yeah it is now Kelly it's Ben Fika now Inter Milan two a super evening in Lisbon for Inter they were majestic from start to finish both goals in the second half Nicola Barela heading in them into the lead after a deep cross from Bustoni the second came from the penalty spot Jean-Maria was penalized for a handball Michael Oliver the referee tonight he checked the pitch side monitor and awarded the spot kick to Inter Milan Lukaku he did the rest Ben Fika's first defeat in Europe this season that could prove very costly so after the first leg Ben Fika Nill Inter Milan two Sahel thank you very much for that elsewhere England 30 game unbeaten run under Serena Begman has come to an end at the hands of Australia they were beaten 2-0 in their final scheduled game before this summer's World Cup England and WSL defender Jelly Flaherty was part of our commentary team on Sports Extra Jelly was this the kind of performance that we're used to seeing from the lionesses no not at all I mean I think obviously over the last 30 young unbeaten game run England have 99% of those games dominated it you know and dictated the the tempo of the games you know they've they've sort of teams have dropped off them but they've controlled it they've been able to do one two touch around teams and been able to move teams because of the level the opposition that they played against would follow the runs and sort of become disjointed but tonight Australia didn't do that they were very compact they were very disciplined defensively and England couldn't break them down so then England become frustrated and they sort of didn't have a plan B and for me Australia deserved to win tonight's game you said before the game you were worried about the lack of relationship between Asmomorgan and Jess Carter did was that an area that Australia were able to exploit yeah I think you see especially as the game went on and become more and more exposed and obviously then Jess Carter ended up coming off towards the end of the game but I also think what didn't help Jess Carter was the fact that she wasn't getting much support from her wingers with tracking back Ellie Carpenter is a a fallback who's aggressive she likes to join in she likes to overlap so there's only so much that Jess Carter can do and I think you see in the first 10 15 minutes with Lauren Hemp she was tracking back she was helping Jess Carter out with Carpenter and then in the second half it sort of opened up even more and she didn't have that support Chloe Kelly wasn't offering it Lauren James wasn't offering it so she was all isolated there and then obviously then the distance and the gap between her and Esme Morgan sort of grew as the game went on and Australia exploited it exactly 100 days to go now until the World Cup in Australia in the summer where they couldn't meet them in the last 16 of the World Cup is there anything that that's concerning you from from this performance can you put it down to a blip given that England have been on such a brilliant run-of-form for me it just it concerns me that I feel like they don't have a plan B and it's funny because someone on social media has said that where before in the Euros for example Alessia Russo and Ella Toon was used as a sort of super subs when now they're not they're not starters you know so you don't have them come off the bench and impacting games they're not starting games so what do you do if 65 70 minutes you haven't got the impact that you wanted from them you can't bring them on again because they've already playing so who do you look to all so you potentially change it and and start Rachel Daly in games that you know then you could bring Alessia Russo on and Ella Toon on for the last 20 25 minutes because that's what worked for them in the Euros so is that potentially what needs to happen now because obviously you had Ellen White starting in the Euros ahead of Alessia Russo do you now change it do you put Rachel Daly there as your number nine and when you know how effective Alessia Russo and Ella Toon are it's coming off the bench but I just built with England they didn't have that and I feel they sort of played into Australia's hands by playing how Australia played but the difference is like I said to Maz is the back four for Australia was set England were trying to play long balls over the top for Alessia Russo or Rachel Daly but the back four you've not moved them you have to move them and that's what Australia were doing they were moving and destroying England's back four so that when they went long the space was there. Jilly good to talk to you thanks so much for now thank you thank you to Jilly Flyerty there and we'll bring you all the the rest of the the reaction to that on the football daily podcast which you can download from the BBC Sounds and subscribe to on the BBC Sounds app here at the Etihad straightforward from Manchester City with a three nil victory against Bayern Munich Josh Stone says Josh has been outstanding. Guardiola has a knack of seeing things in players other stones and improving them he's found himself right back centre back and centre mid throughout and looked comfortable everywhere Chris says whoever ends up as man in the match must feel on top of the world Harlan Rodry Stones Diaz Bernardo Silva Akandji and even Edison have been immense tonight if this isn't City Year City's Year I don't know what is to be honest we're here till 10 30 with more reaction to that win for Manchester City.",
