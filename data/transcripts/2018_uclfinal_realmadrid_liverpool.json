  "transcript": " Well, thanks Kali, yes, thousands and thousands of those Liverpool supporters have got here to Kiev by hook or by crook and they have brought hundreds of flags and banners that are dragged all over the Olympic Stadium here. The Real Madrid fans in white and purple created a mosaic to our right. Hasta el final, Vamos Real was the message from them. This referee is from Serbia, Milorad Mazic, who is just going through his pre-match routine in the centre circle. The teams to repeat are as follows, Real Madrid with Kilo Navas in goal, Kavahal Varan, Ramos and Marcello at the back, Kasimiro, Modric Kros and then Isko behind Benzema and Ronaldo and Liverpool with Karius, Alexander Arnold, Lovren van Dijk and Robertson, Henderson, Vinaldo Manilna, Salah, Firmino and Mane. So this is the 2018 Champions League final and it begins with Liverpool kicking off and playing the ball back into central defence. Liverpool in the all red kit with the white trim pumped forward towards the edge of the Real Madrid penalty area and Real Madrid who are all in white. The five European cup finals that Liverpool have won have all been against teams playing in white. Salah playing the ball through into the penalty area and an important touch from Varan who came across in front of Mane in the penalty area, got his toe to it. And the first contribution from Cristiano Ronaldo on the half way line is a buffeting from Dejan Lovren. Right on the half way line Ronaldo was knocked off the field, went down clutching his back but he's on his feet. So this is five live BBC Radio, Merseyside are with us as well for the commentary this evening so welcome to those listeners and with us in the commentary box Chris Waddle who's played in the final of this competition and Mark Lawrenceon who's won it with Liverpool. Get a word from them in a moment but Real Madrid who in this first half will be playing from right to left. Here is Cristiano Ronaldo with a little flick and then Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a huge cheer for his first touch in the Champions League final which is to whack the ball down field to the other end to Navas. Right start with Liverpool rolled it back, quick and long, high pressure on Real Madrid both horses suddenly just cleared away and as you say Lovren from Cinti Ronaldo welcome to the game but you can see Real Madrid do not panic, look at the play the way out. Real Madrid nil, Liverpool nil and here's Marcelo on the half way line. Real Madrid bidding to win this competition for the third season in a row that's not been done since the 70s. Here's Ronaldo on the left-hand side Ronaldo plays the ball to the edge of the area, Modric slightly behind him now the ball to the right-hand side which is chipped in towards Isco but the offside flag is up and in any case Carrius was out smartly. Carrius did really well John he starts in position he was out very very quickly. Carvajal with the cross looking for Isco through the middle. Right move Ronaldo and he fancies his chances on his left-hand side doesn't he very well a talent he is we know that but he's really come really quite wide he normally plays a lot now and what we saw you did talk about that Chris didn't you whether Ronaldo would play in a wide position or whether he would be tucked in but clearly they are looking to exploit the 19 year old Alexander Arnall but Liverpool coming forward with their front line Salah now back towards Vainal de Mejerci shot which is blocked on the edge of the penalty area and Veran is able to turn and clear it away downfield. Many of those banners are mentioned and referenced the fact that we're watching European Royal Key here tonight. Real Madrid who have the best record in European club competitions. Winners of the European Cup or the Champions League 12 times over the years and Liverpool the most successful British club in European competitions. He has fun date with a pass down the left-hand side but it's beyond Robertson and bounces out of play for a throw. I think if Liverpool was ready to keep pushing the full box on and make a run when they're getting good possession they will get in because it's a way men will not chuck them. Liverpool win the ball back on the left-hand side and it's played away by Carvajal towards the edge of the penalty area but the pitch was a little heavy there from Casamiro and now here is Salah 44 goal more Salah. Tarleks and Arnall who swings the low cross in towards the edge of the penalty area and Veran is able to come across. Great ball in Alexander Arnall never even thought about just delivering it with pace had to be dealt with takes the throw Alexander Arnall flicked on by Vinaldo but cleared away by Real Madrid on the edge of the penalty area. Can you see John already Real Madrid I'm not worried about going pressing the ball high look there everyone's in their own half they're saying yeah go on you can have the ball we're going to cut you on the break. Long pass from Van Dijk but it's headed down on the edge of the area by Sergio Ramos the Real Madrid captain now up towards Cristiano Ronaldo who over ran it trains he was fouled referee Mazic says no Liverpool with Salah more Salah in with a challenge on Salah that looked like a foul and it is giving Liverpool's way I think Ronaldo's going to have a word with their referee as well you're not allowed to tackle him don't forget well he overran the ball he lost control there wasn't a foul and that was a foul definitely more cello there a bit slow so BBC Radio Merseyside are with us the World's Servers are with us as well to welcome to everyone who's listening around the world to this truly global event even if it is in inverted commas the European Cup final and of course two listeners on five live free kick to Liverpool it's nil nil we've played almost five minutes James Milner is waiting over the ball Salah is there as well we're not quite got things ready yet because the two-man Real Madrid wall Modric is one of them and um is putting his hand over his mouth where he speaks to referee Mazic so we're ready for the free kick near the right corner of the box is Liverpool player Milner holds his left arm in the air Salah comes up runs over the ball Milner delivers it square towards Salah who shoots but it was charged down by Modric who was one of the members in the wall threw himself in front of the shot from Salah and blocked it actually back into the Liverpool half where Alexander-Arnold's clearance was very nearly closed down by Isco but it was that Carrier's fortunately was positioned perfectly to be able to calmly play the ball away and the ball is kept in over on the far side the Real Madrid right but it's pulled down now towards the edge of the penalty area but the the covering challenge came in and so Tony Cross the German who is able to run the ball out towards the left hand side and eventually it finds its way back to Marcelo on the edge of his own penalty area so Real Madrid in possession and here's Sergio Ramos who has scored in two Champions League finals memorably against Atlético Madrid in Lisbon Sergio Ramos so much experience in this side it is exactly the same Real Madrid team that started the match in Cardiff a year ago and actually there are five of this Real Madrid team that have started all four of these recent European Cup Champions League finals for Real Madrid Ronaldo couldn't keep the ball couldn't bring it down so Milner finds the ball to Firmino who passes it through but Veran crucially just got there ahead of Mane just outside the D. Wow also Navas what was Navas doing he was in no man's land goalkeeper sprinted out crucially though Veran got the touch and was able to tackle Mane so Liverpool with Vain Alden out towards the left hand side Robertson is there the Scottish left back now back to Vain Alden again middle of the Real Madrid half and he clips a very high pass out to Alexander-Arnold on the right hand side he's able to take it down a little ball he's looking for one two gives it to Salado Salado looks for goal bounces into the area Alexander-Arnold's on to it but Navas is able to come out and smother the ball brilliant at the feet of the teenage fullback very bold he's got to say Liverpool scored a very positive there right tempo moving the ball very quick Real Madrid are absolutely terrified to come at least well not even gone the other centre circle they don't they want to get in 30 yards on the goal they don't want to come any higher the playing little place he made up for his earlier indecision there Kailor Navas by Lawrence very very very brave and Liverpool were very nearly in Kailor Navas the Costa Rican World Cup goalkeeper he has Milner Liverpool has started quite well he has Henderson Henderson kicks the ball out towards the left hand side to Robertson and you can hear the reaction from those thousands of Liverpool supporters in the end to our left Vijn Alder middle of a Real Madrid half chips the ball Robertson's in space on the right hand side so Carvajal goes out there but the cross comes in towards Firmino who's leaning forward and couldn't glance it on as he enjoyed it to do a lot of joy with the fullbacks aren't they they're not going to track back Ronaldo's not Modric doesn't really want to go out there now that he wants to play narrow so really if they can keep getting that ball weight and then he looking for quality from the Liverpool fullbacks and the ball didn't go out of the penalty area for this latest Real Madrid goal kick Sergio Ramos kept it in I think also John with what Chris says there is that you know joy from the Liverpool fullbacks is if you know that you're not going to get tracked back once you get the ball it's imperative that the three forwards get in the box and get early crosses in it's a really large part of this game isn't it the fullback positions whether it's Trent Alexander Arnold and Cristiano Ronaldo or Marcelo and Mo Salah but it is Real Madrid with the ball on the right hand side and Liverpool Robertson is able to win it back and clear up the line it's kept in on the left hand side by Mane and Mane now driving it on Modric comes in with a challenge on it's a good one too I thought he was beaten there for a moment Modric but he recovered very well he's got to do everything Modric's on he's technically great he works ever so hard for the team great yeah he is one of the five that I mentioned who started all of the recent four finals Liverpool coming forward the ball into the penalty area but it just ran away from Fomino on the edge of the box and so Real Madrid were able to clear it long into the Liverpool half cross though now is under the ball uses Modric oh Modric's has a little heavy the challenge from behind by Mane and it is a free kick to Real Madrid I'm not sure the referee actually saw that although it was a free kick he did not see it was looking the other way Real Madrid 0 Liverpool 0 this is the Champions League final the genuine sound of the Champions League final live from Kiev on BBC radio Modric slipping the ball forward towards Benzema it's a question whether Benzema would start this game Gareth Bale only on the substitutes bench tonight and now Modric swings a high crossfield ball at Alexander Arnold heads away but Marcelo is quickly up onto it Marcelo turns away from Milner on his left foot shoots but drags it well wide by four or five. Marcelo picked that up really well he swallows that now and got ahead of his anticipation was excellent a bit nice bit of skill to get a back on who's left football you're not happy with the shot that was well weighed already tonight the big football news back home the fact that Fullerman are in the Premier League next season after winning 1-0 against former European champions Aston Villa 1-0 the final score at Wembley and he 0-0 with 10 minutes on the clock in Kiev and what has been a perfect day weather wise well it's actually been quite breezy and you can just feel a breeze swirling around the inside of the stadium but hardly a cloud in the sky warm sunshine but now it's a little cooler and these are almost perfect conditions for football here's Carvajal to Modric back it goes to Varan in central defence suddenly Ronaldo finds himself right through the middle probably part of the the plan for Zinedine Zidane who's looking to become the first coach to win the Champions League three years running amazing to think that he faced questions last night about how he was under pressure as the Real Madrid coach here is Kroos and now Isko whistles from the Liverpool supporters because Real Madrid have had I think the longest period of sustained possession that we've seen in the match so far from either team never a good at it on the one such angles and like it can just play as well in going anybody and they look after the ball Liverpool which talks so much about the thrilling run that they've had to this Champions League final but as Sergio Ramos was pointing out tonight and he's in possession right now they have had a tough road the defending champions themselves having won against the champions of France the champions of Italy and the champions of Germany in the knockout rounds of this competition and they're still standing even though the only finished third in the Spanish League this season many can only beat champions maybe they can so it is third in the Spanish League against fourth in the Premier League but forget that they are European royalty Mane there's a high foot there on on Mane that they're caught in from Isko but the referee allows play to continue and Mane is okay so Real Madrid back in possession inside their own half and after that sort of frantic first six or seven minutes suddenly Real Madrid have just taken control of things but we thought this could happen John you know we knew Liverpool started right the year for first six minutes they've dropped off the pace a little bit because there's a lot of respect for Real Madrid yeah Henderson playing it through I think Mane was caught there by Kross in the centre circle it was a bouncing ball that was running away from him and referee message says yes he was it's a free kick to Liverpool and they take it short here's Alexander Arnett you've got the ball for last time no three or four minutes they have Alexander Arnett gives it to Vain Aldam Vain Aldam who scored that that ever so important goal as it turned out in the end in Rome all Robertson does very well and takes it on and plays it across the edge of the penalty area it bounces back and now Mane's little ball to Salah Salah shoots on the turn it's blocked Mane in the area he should he defected to Firmino on the left hand side of the box Firmino just holds it up against Carvajal plays it back out of the penalty area that was a clever ball from Firmino now it's worked towards Alexander Arnett on the right hand side chips it across Navas dives forward twinches it out of the penalty area where Ronaldo wins ahead of the Liverpool are back in possession and there we saw it really for the first time Liverpool suddenly causing alarms for the Real Madrid defence just mayhem John just absolute mayhem in there when the ball comes in from Madrid's tiny here here they come again Vain Aldam to the edge of the area but he has challenged and challenged well by Casamiro and now Real Madrid cross the halfway line and it's passed out a play by Cross most unlike an Inpenso Mal frustratingly to Cross points in the other direction is it to say I wondered it there not there to be fair he ran quick checks then went again and Cruz very rarely gives the ball away let's be honest just a little bit more than a standing which they needed a breather there to get up the field and also Ronaldo ran out to the right so he didn't even come to the ball himself it is 0-0 Real Madrid 0 Liverpool 0 5 live World Service Radio Merseyside from the BBC the stadium here 70,000 capacity to mark of a real 70,000 capacity how would the two clubs only get 16,000 kickouts is it well Chris said it there really throwing on the halfway line Marcelo to take this towards Benzema to not have the best of seasons Calum Benzema and now inside his own little one twos with Marcelo and cross then up towards this goal but it bounces off a little bit of this goal but Liverpool then lose possession and now it's been taken on by Carvajal on the right hand side plays the ball Ronaldo into a penalty area on the right drives it go with but over the angle of post and bar went for it himself he had options in the middle but Ronaldo in that position was only one thing in his mind exactly John good little move was that he commits himself Robertson so easy and then he's looking to be very as a quick glance doesn't say what is one thing in his mind power goes all across far was on that far away we've had 15 minutes now mark what are you thinking so far I'm thinking this this is really even Steven I think Madrid are frightened to death when Liverpool get the ball in and around the Madrid penalty area and maybe Liverpool a little bit in so far as they know there's always that risk that they might get caught on the break but probably Liverpool led you know I know a lot of people have made the point about how you know Real Madrid the only experience and whatnot Jurgen Klopp was very clear to say it yesterday yes that's all very well but they've not played us before no and you know in Liverpool the way they played up they do not respect any other team and they just run at them which we've seen and now Milner loses out in an aerial bounce of the ball so Marcelo takes it on now here's the dangerous Modric for this long-lanke blonde hair giving it to Carvajal on the right hand side Ronaldo who's now taken up a position on the right little shimmy from him quick movement of the feet in the way that almost only Ronaldo can and then plays a backwards pass it's made its way to Isco on the left hand side Isco with a flourish plays it to Sergio Ramos now in the full back position Isco little ball towards Marcelo back to Isco on the left hand side Isco's right foot across towards the back post a leap and a header away by Robertson comes out to Casanero and little angle ball from him towards Ronaldo strong challenge from Mane but there was cover there from Modric now the ball on the right hand side with Real Madrid and then Ronaldo was on his heels and Liverpool weren't Robertson weren't and now Liverpool breaking over the halfway line with Mane Salah points where he wants it but Mane held the ball there and it goes back to Henderson in the centre circle nil nil if you've just joined us here in Kiev Alexander-Arnold goes for a high angle pass towards the edge of the area but that was watched all the way onto the forehead of Varela. You can see the temptation and release Salah one on one with Ramos on a race he fenced his chances didn't he but the wrist back comes in. Carlos pass from I think it was Carvajal on the right hand side across his own penalty area not a particular danger but it was nowhere near anyone else in white and it went in for a corner the only person that was near to it was with Ramos and he decided that he probably couldn't deal with it because he was facing his own goal so we have the first corner of this 2018 Champions League final Liverpool have it almost 18 minutes played and the corner to be taken from the right and we have Mane in the six yard but here's the delivery go on to back post now that comes for it was struggling there were two Liverpool players van Dyck most forcibly put in the challenge don't think he's given that as a free kick he's had it over no and I think the next corner to get our free kick do exactly the same thing the goalkeeper was nowhere near it nowhere no where near he ended up on his back side you've got to say he's really he keeps his shape because he's a very good shot stopper isn't he we know across his and he punches everything when he can and but he is a very very good shot stopper but obviously constant rumors about whether he might be replaced as the Real Madrid goalkeeper here is Marcelo off inside his own half Jürgen Klopp standing with his hands clasped behind his back Jürgen Klopp who's lost in his last five finals as a manager either at Liverpool where he said two of them the League Cup and the Europa League in Basel two years ago against Sevilla Uni Emery's Sevilla if you remember and then before that three with Borussia Dortmund Real Madrid with the ball at the back being pressed by Klopp's Liverpool and they have to go back to us the time they're on they've got to the brilliant they're playing the ball a feet and little given goals they've got nobody can run in behind now not one player stretches them they don't not one of them takes off is if they come to the ball and say I'm off go on play it play it down the side and I'll trace it nobody does five live Real Madrid nil Liverpool nil and it's Ali Ali Ali from the Liverpool supporters twirling their scarves above their heads I mean 16 000 official ticket allowance but there are many more than 16 000 Liverpool supporters in this stadium here tonight as Marcelo rubs the back of his head he was challenged with no free kick referee has allowed it to run when he when he can and Real Madrid back in possession with almost 20 minutes played when it is still nil nil for round goes for a long left-footed ball it's got a lot of the drop over his shoulder but couldn't keep it in it's out of play for a three-in John that's two or three times if you use the diagonal and basically they just put it out of play Madrid good pressure from Liverpool they're almost sensing come on then what what you're going to do and as Chris says until Madrid make the pitch bigger they're going to struggle to get possession in the third final third or Liverpool's final third certainly yeah they have unsettled Real Madrid I mean the latent track is always there from Real Madrid but one of the many banners in the Liverpool end reads we are what you fear the Scousers are here which had a certain ominous tone to it here's Isco who turns infield away from Vine Elgin on a little challenge that's why I'm very surprised that the ball didn't stop and you can sense you can come on and somebody will actually they will both run in behind unless it's his game plan the other thing as well is is that Carvajal basically is the only right-sided player who's got any chance of getting forward there's nobody in front of him this is a because it's almost like Carvajal and Robertson are playing against each other in both ends. Real with the ball at the back Sergio Ramos Real Madrid's number four 32 years old now long pass from him Isco Ronaldo currently through the middle but a challenge on Carvajal on the half way line James Milner with it he's fine John Benzema goes rolling around is rolling around the mid-mid player because he wants a booking quick free kick looking for an elbow through the middle that it was calmly dealt with by Van Dijk the January sizing and signing the world record defender and now Robertson with a long ball over the top his stretch it's missed by Baran it's not on towards Mane but the covering challenge from Sergio Ramos to take the ball away from Mane that was a really good opportunity for Liverpool the header to try and play Mane in was actually too heavy if he'd been the right way Mane would have been in on goal on that pass that's Mark Lawlinson Kelly Kates is with us here we'll have a six or six by the way at the end of this match so you can talk to Kelly and Mark about the Champions League final and whatever unfolds over the course of the next what hour or so here is Vijnaldum it's Mil-Mil Vijnaldum turning away from Isco and playing the ball out for Robertson on the left hand side so Liverpool have started well they have created threats here they come again with Vijnaldum they will play the ball out towards the left hand side and Milner exchanges passes gets it back Milner's low ball in towards Firmino who turns and shoots it's booked away to Alexander-Royals he drives it in and it's saved by Kelly now that's more on that from Chris Wubble and from Mark Lawlinson and Alan Dream now the half-time two chances for Liverpool to take the lead first Firmino and then Alexander-Arnold and actually Madrid just held them out Madrid are rocking Alan they're absolutely rocking here it'd be a great time to score oh wait it was a great save you really caught it well and it was he got down very too straight and held on to it but they've just they did the play nice football round they did but they just can't get up the pile it's there's nobody wants to run van Dijk plays it heftily outfield beyond Manny and is headed curfew back by Carpajal to goalkeeper Navas just feel Mark with Liverpool starting too brightly they need to score yeah yeah but I think I think they feel that's really the last passes you played that you know that these very very possible Madrid now can't even get their passing going the pressing for Liverpool is wonderful the ball is back with Karius Karius said to the captain Henderson and now the German keeper wants more Ronaldo just falling out there with with Benzemar as well in terms of closing people down so it's all good for Liverpool's final view and Ronaldo cuts out rather frustrated figure at the moment you know looking for support from the referee that would be unfair support if he got it Alexander-Arnold with a throw and chetted back by Salah finds Firmino but then the ball breaks for Marcelo the left ball back say left ball back he hardly ever plays as a full back great press in while that's a fantastic question from Ronaldo forcing a throw in for Liverpool Alexander-Arnold to take it a few yards over the halfway line down the Liverpool right it's nil nil after nearly 25 minutes here on five live the world service and really a mercy side Salah gets from the ball Salah tackle fairly tackle according to the referee ball breaks to Isco where can he go and look pressing absolutely magnificent are they fouled him he fouled it I don't think Liverpool players think that it was a foul but he had him running towards his own goal as Salah's gone down yeah it doesn't look too good he's going to blow in the face is he short shoulder yeah he's holding his left shoulder look he's still on it it was the way he went down yeah he's doing it yeah he's gracious ouch ouch ouch just watching the replay the tackle was by Ramos the captain of Real Madrid Salah felt very awkwardly I hope that's not dislocated Liverpool must hope that he'll be all right to continue playing he certainly impainted the moment in receiving treatment yeah physio and the doctor on but just going back to the point is we worry about Salah from Liverpool's point of view they just have Madrid going towards on goal there's three Liverpool players around the Madrid player the last thing he wanted him to do was was fouling because he was he was panicking he could have pinched the ball off and I think they can sense it now Liverpool are feeling the game now 25 minutes and I think they're thinking you know what we can up the level here in the last five minutes of not the Real Madrid settle and the two had two decent half chances haven't we're seeing replay after replay if he instantly involved in Ramos and Salah do you think it was a foul by Ramos he certainly pulled Salah's right arm back Salah's onto his feet and this is little off the Liverpool fans and I think it's okay it's fine might be sore and he's pointing again to the physios and Liverpool fans will be concerned by the way talking about Liverpool fans if you look out from our commentary position in the west side of the arena Liverpool fans stretch from our right all along in front of us all around towards the left and about two thirds around the other side it looks like it's two thirds red to one third white for Real Madrid well somebody said before they'd be about Liverpool about 40,000 Liverpool supporters in the stadium so that would be about right well the attendance tonight is 63,000 not the capacity 70,000 63,000 players resumed Salah's back on the pitch ball said Mani in the far side Mani and Pimino started very brightly Mani beats one Real player taking on a second gets the cross in did he hit a defender well yes the referee responded belatedly I think he was helped out by the touchline official who looked along and well decided it's a corner at Liverpool stop dress touchline official how does something actually you see the manicured build-up before the game the way the five officials were running in tandem across the pitch yes they've been rehearsing out for weeks you know it's really ridiculous Milner will take the resultant corner for Liverpool and now Real Madrid might be just concerned about Virgil van Dijk yeah stick it stick it and in the other corners and we look like stick it in the same place see what the goalkeeper does do not foul him there it's played in towards Navas goalkeeper punches it away but this time the referee spots an infringement spots a foul and it's a free kick no Salah's down again this is worrying for Liverpool yeah it's hard to tell how Navas was fouled there Mohammed Salah's lying down in the middle of the Real Madrid half this would be a terrible blow he's in tears my shoulder you could lip read what he said there right shoulder I have to say a dislocated man in a european cup final and at Heisel I knew straight away though that was dislocated because I've done it before I don't know whether it is is fully dislocated but but obviously it's like a ball and socket thing and once it comes out once Alan it stays out permanently unless you have an operation while he's in tears and it is double tears because of the pain and the agony of knowing that he's about to leave the champions league final he's back on his feet again but I think that's only to walk off the field he's been top of it by Mane but Mohsala 44 goals this season 10 of them in the champions league a fantastic season for the Egyptian and it's not just the champions league final of the state year it's also Egypt in the World Cup you think the lana's coming up yep it is he's coming on the lana's coming on there this is this well you cannot underestimate the size of the blow to little two and he's coming out while I need it here well this is such a blow but I have to say of the front three so far in the opening 28 29 minutes it's been manning for meal that have caused most difficulty for the Real Madrid yes it might just be the threat of Salah on the other side occupying two defenders and it's given Mane and Firmino the room to play so Mohsala is off after 30 minutes of the 2018 Champions League final the world will the lana play what's up on the left Mane will come right on the right and Firmino still through the middle it's a throw for Liverpool without question and it's heartening for Real Madrid who started the lesser impressive of the two tiers but it doesn't stop Liverpool pressing now it doesn't here's Van Dijk heading the ball away to Robertson as the game resumes ball played forward brilliantly chested pass by Firmino to the lana lana looks to find Mane can't quite do so I really I really cut looking at Madrid they're like a dog's dinner that they're absolutely all over the place the ball is back with Ramos whose challenge for or otherwise led to Salah's substitution Marcello into Cruz Cruz at the halfway line forward it goes Benzema takes it up Benzema oh plays it that's danger here for Liverpool Mavrick inside the penalty here Mavrick just shot was limp unconvincing heads of defender and he goes out of play for the glory great block by Robertson now excellent defending he got really really close and in those situations you're full back the first rule is make sure you're in in the way of it so it hits you at the very least Robertson cost a couple of quid it's a fantastic save unbelievable yeah unbelievable story from the throwing Real Madrid in possession it's still 0-0 here Liverpool and Real Madrid in Kiev Marcello back to Ramos who's being pulled by the Liverpool fans who clearly feel that his involvement in the challenge on Salah led to the Egyptians injury maybe maybe that's a bit harsh on Ramos anyway Cruz plays it forward to Isco right to Ronaldo on the left side Ronaldo to your outside the penalty here finds Marcello back to Ronaldo no takes it up Benzema with a shot as the ball broke down it's cleared by Liverpool's Milder and it goes towards the far side out of play for throwing to Real Madrid good defending by Liverpool as soon as the ball came to Benzema Milder was there very very quickly just stood up and say again just hit me I'm in the way having dominated since Salah's gone off Real have taken charge here's Isco once more tackled by Manny Manny wins the ball well Manny takes it past two Real players my taking it past the third that's what the challenge was that and I'm quite far out he's got my cousin here a lot he's got a free kick yeah he did a well he did a well Manny very cleverly disguised he was very good at getting free kicks you've got to say that but uh they've just stepped up the gears a little bit they have definitely good ball by Cruz I defined Isco Marcello to his left but it was played infield to Benzema I know it's with Modric just inside the centre circle inside the Liverpool half onto Carvajal on the far side of the field 12 minutes to go to half time here you're missing the five life the World Service and Radio Merseyside Radio Merseyside will be particularly concerned about the disruption caused by the substitution of Mo Salah no good crossfield ball by Ramos to the far side control world two by Carvajal taking up ball played on to Carvajal again then the challenge came in by Robertson ball breaks to Lallana who came on a substitute for Mo Salah he chips it towards Fomino who's had a play off a Real body it's a throw into Liverpool who gets Liverpool the chance to move up the pitch yeah yeah just a little bit whoops somebody's done is that Ronaldo no no it's the right back is it not Carvajal Carvajal Ronaldo did I suppose console Mo Salah as he had to go off much of the way console David Beckham when he was instrumental in Beckham being set up in the World Cup game many years ago between England and Portugal he didn't wish the goal was not happy to get to Carvajal a little wink Carvajal pulled his arm string a few games ago didn't he where he missed the semi didn't he yeah he's only just come back after the hands away injury I think the way he's reacting is crying again I think he's crying in house he knows he's gone as well so if he plays like he did last day he put Vasquez way but he struggled badly yes Vasquez is on the bench he should put that shoulder if he's going to put anybody with respect to Carvajal if he has to be substituted there's no comparison in terms of the substitutions that have been enforced this is really interesting so Liverpool are having a break now they're coming over I was going to say and clock clock wasn't anywhere neither now he's jogging over to the players obviously to have a little word with them the break in play useful for Liverpool and the stretch is coming on for Carvajal the right full back of Ray on the drill 10 minutes to half time but quite a lot of time will have to be added on at the end of the regular 45 minutes because of the two injuries that have been sustained suddenly Carvajal's on his feet again is the stretcher on the pitch and over reaction I think that shows coming up interesting yeah Carvajal's definitely not continuing well he's crying as well it's not sure it is not to that is the better defender well that was evident any time we've been watching Ray on the drill of late seeing Vasquez at right back so Nacho being instructed by Zinedine to that and the Real coach telling him what he wants maybe more attention paid to Manny when he's done that side having managed him pretty well very good very good but this might not work out particularly well for Liverpool lines that is more of a naturally defended Nacho while the Liverpool fans are applauding Carvajal as he's going off behind the goal to the left that's where most of the Liverpool fans are I say that's for most of them but there are two thirds around this stadium I don't think Nacho is going to affect because Adam Lallana is playing on the left isn't he Adam Lallana is not really going to see and I'm taking you one when I get the ball like Marnie but Robinson might well maybe maybe the game resumes Liverpool in possession following a Liverpool throw in it's back to Carrius Carrius sweeps it towards the far side neat header in field by Robertson tripped on Lallana gets to the ball chips it high falls down to Liverpool Milner take it through the pace of the pass just took the ball away from the Liverpool player through to the goalkeeper just wouldn't come down with it a little bit of loft on it here's Ronaldo with a pass to Benzema Benzema just nudges it back to Marsello and now it's Casinira to Modric Modric onto the far side of the field it's go back to the news right full back Nacho Modric wants more for Real Madrid eight minutes to half time plus a fair amount of added time that you can expect probably four minutes here's Ramos Liverpool supporters recognize it was Ramos in possession boom now it's played down the left flank and it's knocked back by Benzema Ronaldo squeezes the pass into Casinira Casinira chips it to the far side and it's with Nacho Esco and support Nacho taps the pass back to Esco back to Modric Esco wants more Nacho again Esco for the third time involved in the movement but they're still outside the Liverpool danger area for the moment taking their time Real Madrid still no runner in behind them long with that it's back down the centre so 38 minutes Ramos to Varan his form has been questionable of late the Frenchman still Real Madrid had the ball it's with Modric just a little bit of a penalty good work by Modric uh date is very past my date initially and then when he crossed the ball my date stretched with his right foot and put the ball behind for a corner we see shots of Carvajal going off straight into the dressing room I don't think they've got the option because they're not going to run this they've got to keep the ball you know it must be very frustrating because they've got players who can't play the pass six and a half minutes remain of the regular 45 still 0-0 Liverpool and Real Madrid corner was taken short to Modric now it's played back to Marcello go back again and Modric wants more on the far side of the field and now Marcello covering the ball looking for Benzema headed away by Alexander Arnaud both falling through Isco just on the edge of the penalty to Cruz Cruz back to Isco and now Benzema Isco wants more they're keeping possession but where's the penetration but there is none not only that Liverpool swarmed out they were like bees they're all all around Real Madrid and in the end they just forced the mistake yet again this is back to Liverpool's best pressing performances of the season absolutely way up there what a time to do it as well throwing in the halfway line to Liverpool Alexander Arnaud to take it and if the gander front doesn't get out of the way he knows he's standing up and obstructing people's view from behind I might have a word to say to him oh he's gone away now good night son I suggest you have two words could you meet a suggestion what they might be now go go go go you said good night son why separate my good night anyway never mind 40 minutes play here in Kier Marcello with a loose pass intercepted by Alexander Arnaud whose pass up field runs back into the possession of Real Madrid it's with Ramos their captain scored to the right to Varan definitely Real have been second best but now it's played for with the flights immediately up for offside free kick to Liverpool that's the only second attempted pass over Liverpool back forward that's a great ball forward to Mane join the right side for Liverpool Mane closer to the corner flight keeps it in play beats Ramos just taking it inside of him Mane crosses into the penalty deep it's intercepted by Mogherit's that was a very important the deception by the Croatian he plays at Isco on to Ronaldo they snide by Love Room Alexander Arnaud getting back in contention oh Ronaldo's pass was awful wasn't his fault though look no it never is on the far side of the field Robertson good play by Robertson on to La Lada Landa La Landa squander's possession and it's with Mogherit again for Real Madrid to the right side the keeping possession but they're slow and they're not penetrating no and in all honesty the only thing missing from Liverpool's performance is a goal Marcello take the ball in nice touch back by Benzema to Ronaldo Ronaldo suddenly surrounded by red shirts and he finds a white shirt and it goes back by Isco to Mogherit and now it's Ramos on to Benzema Benzema to Mogherit again white shirts available on the far side that's the right play Mogherit's problem amongst them but look he turns back and so happy with the options further off the field plays it back to Viral now it's the Ramos to Viral almost getting in the centre spot yes he's seen Liverpool supporters are seeing and it's just much I think try to make sure the team doesn't get despondent over the injury to Mo Salah his clues cruise the German chips away towards the far side of the field natural brings it under control very well natural comes forward two red shirts and close proximity but he plays it to the right gets the return pass slinks across it Ronaldo that great save initially right Benzema from the save by Carries Ronaldo with a header that Benzema's offside I've got to say it was great build up player now we've been taught about Real Madrid nobody runs in behind but they work it ever so well off the other side of the situation the first one yep yep he's just off saving the Naldo he should have scored with the header anyway Benzema shouldn't have put the rebound in well he was offside anyway got it right well done well done the Lonesome and Carries wasn't to know and he didn't he made the save which we're just saying for that's absolutely 43 minutes play we awake the first goal of the 2018 Champions League final here in Pierre and there in a nutshell is everything that Ronaldo's about really in safaras hardly had a touch of the ball been given away and he just split second and gets away from the defender defender just gets lost under the flight of the ball and a really really good chance fortunately offside I don't admire his arrogance but he's still a brilliant player 120 Champions League goals never full press three for me to win the ball back and then it's a loose pass by for me no I don't see that free given it's really taking an early advantage didn't they Real Madrid won't help me winning the half time that was dim-witted by the referee now it's back with Cruz inside the center circle and it's Ramos on the halfway line they peculiar noises in our headphones I hope you're not hearing them back home back home in England this thing on five live and radio mercy site on the world service great play by Lovren to deny Marcello and Liverpool bring it out of the fence Mane back to Ronaldo Minaldo chips it forward down the right plank hoping that Mane will chase successfully after it but doesn't get there we go from bad noise to an echo permanent echo I'm afraid I'm sorry tonight isn't great now I'm afraid I'm not afraid but Real Madrid's play isn't great which is great as it were inside the last minute of the first 45 at a time to come cross into the penalty by Benzler shot into the side netting so you won't you can see we're not real images not great but the last five ten point six minutes yeah really in the game the donated Liverpool have come off the gas and they're asking for trouble the drops really deep Liverpool and also Henderson sorry Robinson was so tucked in there that really should be able to chest that ball down when the cross comes in and roll it back to carriers right only three added minutes seems rather mean considering the two substantial injuries yeah Salah and Carver half certainly Salah's injuries seem to be at least three or four minutes on its own yeah you know he would down twice and he couldn't move and Carver half as well Liverpool has chipped in from the left-hand side by Liverpool but not before I think an Econo to play yesterday's the throw into Real Madrid and momentarily two balls I think we're on the pitch I think generally Klopp will be very pleased with Orville's first half apart from the last couple of warnings we've had late on in the first half where they just lacked a little bit of concentration and you can see how Madrid can get in the clear zone if they don't keep that tempo up and that person high up the field I'm seeing all the time really high but at least the middle of the park they've just showed me on it in the last five minutes what they can do there's a great ball by Cruz to the right side that's taken up by Nacho Nacho taps the ball in field it's with Cruz on the edge of the centre certainly chips it to Marcello Marcello controls it instantly good play from the Brazilian ball back edge of the Liverpool penalty area will he get the cross and no he can't do because Alexander Arles gets in the tackle even at the concentration of a corner very good defending what's the ball stood on his feet that was don't watch the feet what's the ball cornered around Madrid who have been much better since Salah went off injured Cruz to take the corner from the left-hand side only four white shirts in the penalty area and I think Liverpool had got everybody back I want to surprise Liverpool one possession to pull a corner from a player of the quality of Cruz here's Isco Isco not getting past Manny Manny's too strong from well played Manny on to Firmino Firmino taps it into the Henderson Henderson's chip in the direction of Manny but it's gone out of play on the throw into Real Madrid Marcello to take it Liverpool mustn't concede a goal here just before half time maybe the better side in the first half Real have it on the far side of the field with Baran Baran to Casemiro and Casemiro plays at the left side chested back by Marcello this is good play by Real on the left plate captain field to Benzema Benzema lines up the shot should wide carries had it covered got to say they've just come off the pace and you know Salah went off but the last 10 minutes you've got to say that Real Madrid have dominated the game they've had two decent chances and Liverpool really have been the best save for what 35 minutes of the game and they've just come off just seeing a replay of the offside against Ronaldo the assistant in the first I was completely correct though it was interesting he only raised his flag after the save had been made by Karius and Benzema tucked it away into the net as long as he raises it that's the heads of him, the clash of heads, Cruz and Milner, well Firmino it is rather and it's going to be Casemiro for the near-orders he seems to have come off worst referee demanding the ball I think he may well be growing the half-time whistle good news is Bobby's teeth are all right, his blue, yeah he has he wants half time but let's hope Casemiro is okay, well there's an accident with Casca Peds sending off for Milner's fault I think as well I think Liverpool generally have been in control of the game but once Salah has gone off it's a little bit it's a little bit like we've we've saw in Madrid they were kind of rattled for a long period of that game from the start and then all of a sudden Liverpool thought they'd done the job as Chris said they'd stop pressing and once they start pressing the two opportunities that Madrid had were as good as any opportunities in the game so far Chris yeah I agree I think 35 minutes Liverpool played which you expect they had a couple of good chances Navasmej couple saves they looked threatening all the time with the pace that's 10 minutes they just come off the pace don't know why Ramsey came back in the game they look very dangerous themselves half-time Neil Mill thank you Kelly yes Real Madrid Mill Liverpool Mill so both sides had to make a substitution in the first half Salah replaced by Lallana and Carvajal replaced by Nacho and really they were agonising scenes to watch both players who were so upset having to leave the field in the first half of the Champions League final so Real Madrid with Navasen goal Nacho the substituted right back Verran Ramos and Marsello is the second half begins Real Madrid kicking off Casamiro and Modric and Croce in midfield with Isco, Benzema and Ronaldo there's been lots of movement between Ronaldo Isco and Benzema Ronaldo has been on the left he's been through the middle and he's been on the right hand side and the Liverpool team now carries in goal Alexander Arnold Lovren van Dyke and Robertson Henderson van Alden and Milner and then Lallana now on the left Mané on the right and Firmino through the middle so it is Neil Mill second half just a few seconds old and Liverpool in the almost all red kit with the white trim white numbers on the backs against the famous all white of Real Madrid the record winners of the European Cup he has Mané in the area on the left hand side goal running towards the byline back heals it but only into the path of Modric who's down in the full back position playing it forward and winning a goal kick off Lallana so this is five live the World Service and Radio Merseyside from the BBC were live in the Olympic Stadium here in Kiev on a dry relatively mild evening and with us watching in the commentary position Chris Waddle who's played in the final of this competition and Mark Lawrence in who won it with Liverpool and Mark you dislocated your shoulder so what would you say about Salah? Well you have an operation and it's called putty flat and you basically over so one of the muscles so that the dislocation doesn't happen again it makes it quite weak for a while I would suggest John six weeks maximum he would be okay right so for listeners on the World Service in Egypt forget about that they might decide not to have an operation but I'll guarantee you anything that if he doesn't it will come out again well he was in tears and it really actually was quite emotional to see the close-ups that we could see on our screens here the Real Madrid playing from left to right playing it down the right hand side to Benzema scored two goals against Bayern Munich in the semifinal Benzema crossing well good looking cross which is headed away rattles around off Isko but bounces back the carrier ball Benzema there the bandaid thought he's got him he gets what half a yard and whips it in nobody reacts real ball away Real Madrid have had the ball in the net in the first half he has Marcelo playing it across it's deflected and it's lifted against the crossbar and put wide isko 12 yards out it's seen goalbound it bounced off a Liverpool man I think Lallana into the path of Isko who lifted it over the top of the cross under the face of the crossbar for chances you've got to take that Isko's had a really average game so far he's not been in the game it's all in it's actually come off his shim it has come off the front of his shin definitely big scare for Liverpool still 0-0 cross with a corner headed away 10 yards out one of who shouts for handball lead bounces out to Marcelo he plays it to the left hand side a little ball slipped across the angle ball back looking for Ronaldo who's near the penalty spot who's intercepting the mysterious John yeah as he collided with the post do you think well I don't think he's collided with anybody else looking at it most certainly so oh no he hasn't or did he oh no sorry that was was he injured the replay we've just seen was maybe from before yeah Isko's chance wonder if he injured himself and touch anybody didn't he as he slays up now is okay but that's a let off big let off yeah yeah just didn't make a great connection as Chris said it came off his shin as I was saying in the build up to that attack Reymu Drift you weren't listening the first half did have the ball in the net the goal scored by Benzema after Ronaldo's header was very well saved actually by Karius was flagged the offside there was not much in that and there is go has seen a shot against the crossbar Real Madrid 0 Liverpool 0 after Liverpool played so very well in the first half hour Alexander Arnold had a good opportunity that was well saved by Navas but really since about the time Salah had to leave the field Real Madrid have improved and improved and they have had those opportunities to score here is by Nalden on the halfway line the ball played out towards the right hand side the 19 year old Alexander Arnold passes it forward but it's straight on the head of Sergio Ramos then Marcelo wins the free kick great play and then the challenge by Firmino great play by Marcello just change your feet ball one ball left to right past Firmino there's nothing wrong with him he's got his weaknesses defensively you know that don't you but he's very good on the ball sensational yes he was asked yesterday Marcello about Jurgen Klopp presumably seemingly saying that you know he maybe wasn't the best defender predictably Marcello said what I've not I've not heard that I've not seen those comments here's Kelo Navas striking a long downfield towards Benzema so towards the right with Van Dijk in with a strong challenge Van Dijk now a cushioned header which bounces centrally for Ronaldo who's all over it winning it ahead of Vijn Alden and then Cross lifts the ball over the top but it bounces through to Karius Karius was trying to distribute it and Benzema blocked it I think with his head he's right for Benzema blocked it he got his foot to the clearance by Karius who was trying to get rid of the ball trying to distribute it to his teammate and Benzema has deflected it back and it rolled agonizingly agonizingly into the back of the Liverpool net it's 1-0 to Real Madrid well you won't concede a softer goal will you and he's trying to say to the referee Karius that obviously there was a problem with Benzema I don't think there was he tried to roll it really quickly and all Benzema did was actually just put his foot in the way and it just seemed to bounce off it it was such a simple goal but what it's a schoolboy howler absolutely schoolboy howler there's no way Karius can say that's a foul no that is bad decision making bad decision making I think he knew it Karius he knew that yeah yeah he was he was resigned to it he just under armed it into the outstretched left leg of Benzema who was leaning forward and it really just hit him and rebounded into the net Benzema the goal is scored against Bayern and the goal right wouldn't make a decision slipping over yeah well again everyone was saying yesterday from Real Madrid Liverpool as Manny has picked up for a foul on Ramos and the Real Madrid players are very unhappy with that and three of them have gone to both the assistant on the far side and referee message this is what this is what Madrid a brilliant attack you talked about this yeah this is this is what they do now all of a sudden Manny's having a talking to Ramos he went down Polax he got up and now there's nothing wrong with him we saw this against Juventus last year did we not well the referee has um he'd never be a heavyweight would he oh the referee dear oh dear I presume being in conversation with his assistant yeah Ramos was went down Cardinal did he stand on Cardinal put his hand up to his eye Marcelo playing for the Benzema who's in an offside position who did he get sent off last year for Juventus quadrado yeah in the final and he did he got him sent off and that was referred to by Jürgen Kron they don't all the time and that's all they've been brought up yeah but listen they spoke everyone last night spoke about how in a final like this the moments of luck fortune that's what it is mistakes whatever it's all but that is really a catastrophic in football in terms a catastrophic way to go a goal down in the match like this one nil Real Madrid lead this is five live ready on those you side in the world service from the BBC you can hear the frustration of another pool fans Mark Lawrence and yeah well also now Milner's on at the referee you know the senior pros in the Liverpool team we've almost got you've got to say forget it come on we need a goal let's just start playing football let's forget about everything else and let's get back to the way we played for the first half an hour at least in the first half so without more salad and now a goal behind here comes Robertson playing the ball in from the left hand side but it's lifted up not not completely away by Casemiro and Mane was able to get to it that was poor from Real Madrid Mane plays it to Milner Milner left it in it takes a flick off the head of Ferran which took it away from Firmino who was inside the six yard box and it's through for a corner that's a good response to play ball in by Milner wasn't it just misses this smile he just gets it tooks on him around Disney I mean you can't get out of the far post towards the corner Milner running over to take the corner with his arms whips up the Liverpool supporters at that end of the ground Liverpool both teams attacking towards the the ends where the bulk of their supporters are Milner with the corner one nil down Liverpool here it is it's a high one towards the penalty spot and it's headed by Lovren and pocked into the net by Mane Liverpool have equalised Real Madrid were in front for only four minutes the header from Lovren and Mane got the crucial touch inside the six yard box to make it Real Madrid one Liverpool one well that's the way you reply when you go go down in the final and a joke go to give away well done to Mane just involved in an incident with Ramos he's just got on with it and he's put Liverpool right back in this game I've got to say he's been Liverpool's best player tonight Mane's been excellent we're just looking at it here no he's not offside he's well onside he's reacted first got there before they keep up and it's a good touch but he reacts more shallow does it the goalie does it and he's there definitely onside and he's headed as well he could head about Lovren yeah strong Mane has been the best player tonight for Liverpool well everyone was predicting goals I don't think many were predicting no no at half time but we've now had a goal a piece and we're 10 minutes into the second half nothing gets you going more than a goal John well it's certainly got those Liverpool supporters going smoke bombs have been let off there is red smoke oh that's it a lunging challenge by Roberton on Nacho and Real Madrid coming forward Nacho's okay he's back on his feet Marcelo plays it square he has crossed into the penalty area his goal but it was intersected crucially by Henderson got my game now isn't it Tim O's back now both teams going for it feels like a cut match this is more what we expected one one after the free goal scored by Benzema terrible error by Karius terrible error and as Mark and Chris have been saying absolutely crucial that Karius not easy puts that out of his mind he's just got to forget about it he's helped massively by the fact that Mane has equalised says Marcelo now for Real Madrid goal towards Ronaldo beautiful touch from Ronaldo turns goes for the pipeline Lovren slides in and is able to scoop it away out for a throw down the length you can feel the game being extended quite you can just as you as you're watching it it's starting to spread out completely brilliant noise from the Liverpool supporters absolutely superb Real Madrid take the throw Marcelo gets it back swirls it in and it's headed away by Van Gaik just readjusted Liverpool's number four clears it out to Isco on the right hand side Isco back towards Nacho who came on as the substitute for Carvajales in the Spanish World Cup squad Nacho we will have courage of the World Cup on five live for you coming up in the next couple of weeks whenever there's a match on you'll hear it either on five live or sports extra live from Russia Marcelo little touch then back towards the halfway line and Mane puts in the challenge and now Sergio Ramos takes it on wins a throw in off by Naldum on the far side and Mane has taken a knock and he's down on his knees and Cruz left his foot in a little bit there because he lost possession and he got it back he sort of left his foot in Armani Sergio Mane that goal by the way was his 20th of the season the third Liverpool player to reach 20 this season after Salah and Firmino and he now has also got 10 goals in the Champions League this season just like Salah and Firmino in the competition proper that is one won the score Jürgen Klopp wildly waving his arms on the edge of the coaching area as Nacho was put under pressure but Real Madrid calmly and the great pressing played away out of difficulty that red smoke is still drifting across the Kiev stadium here and we can smell it as well here's Modric back towards Isko Liverpool flying into the challenges Milner in with the latest one on Modric and then Casamiro had three Liverpool players around him then that's given away by Van Dyke and Real Madrid back in possession in St. Paul. That's fantastic at the minute that goal was given at least a late point how long can they keep it up well that they just got a common goal and it's over 18, pressure the right team that's what they're trying to do Mane who's okay back on his feet but Marcelo is wriggling away from him. Marcelo goes down the ball runs free there's no free kick now it's taken on but Van Alden sort of lost his foot in there as much as anything. Modric now Modric just overrun it and Robertson came in with a challenge and whacked it away I think he made contact with Modric as well but he's got a ball good tackle. Not him wrong with that yeah the ball had a ball. Good tackle. Well done Nefri by the way. I think he's he's led it close yeah. Not Nefri a few questions. One won the score. We just over half an hour to play. Benzemaak. Benzemaak scored the Real Madrid opening goal. Now Modric on the right hand side plays it back towards Nato behind him. Cross swings the ball out towards the left hand side where it's taken down and played forward to Ronaldo who's on the left hand side Ronaldo turns gives it back to Isco. Isco moving in from the left hand side a little past square Casamiro turns under pressure gives it to Modric. Modric sets himself and then drifts around Milner Modric still going. Nato now. Nato's ball across into the penalty go shut on the train from Isco and Carrios diving to his left as able to block it around the post. I don't think he needed the stadium. I think he was going wide I suppose after making a big mistake you can understand why he did decide to save it. There's a reaction save making a big conference corner nevertheless. One won the score. Cross to take it. The tall blonde-haired German with the out swinger towards the edge of towards the penalty spot that is headed away by Firmino for Liverpool. Cross had come back from an upside position and the flag went up with a push. Isco is substitution and it's Gareth Bale coming on for Real Madrid. It's not going to be Isco and it is Isco. So Gareth Bale runs onto the field to appear in a Champions League final for the fourth time which is the same number of Champions League finals that Ryan Giggs played in and on he comes. Isco's off gets a pat on the back from Zidane and Bale sends out a couple of instructions there. Well it looks like Bale's going to start on the right obviously and then cutting. They will be quite now because Ronaldo wants to play the left and the left he is not allowed to play on the left. Real Madrid won Liverpool won and Gareth Bale honors the substitute just as in Cardiff in the final last year when Real Madrid successfully defended the title. He also had a play for a twin to the holders halfway inside their own half. Taken by natural. Bale gets his first touch but behind him Robertson lifts the ball into the Real Madrid half then Varan stabs it away with his right foot. Vijn Elden's clearance pass forward is blocked by Croes and Lovren has to go back to his goalkeeper. Carriers behind him. Carriers just plays it with his right foot out to his right and then the blonde hair German goalkeeper long ball downfield onto the head of Varan. Modric picks up the loose ball in midfield and plays it to Marsello who's off on one of those marauding Marsello runs. He has Ronaldo out there with him as well. Ronaldo back to Marsello who tried to thread it through. There were three Liverpool players there though and it was blocked away towards the halfway line. Real Madrid will start again. Gareth Bale. His dark hair tied up on the back of his head. Bale to Modric and then Bale again passing it back into his own half and now Varan the tall Frenchman finds Modric on the right hand side here just makes a dart in front of where Zinedine Zidane the great Zidane who scored that brilliant goal in the final at Handen stands. Croes now out towards the left hand side where it's taken down by Ronaldo. Ronaldo drifting from left to right. Henderson puts in the final challenge so Ronaldo plays it back to Casamiro who plays it to his fellow Brazilian Marsello on the left hand side. Marsello is right footed ball and overhand kick it's in from Bale. What a goal! What a brilliant goal in the Champions League final from Gareth Bale and Real Madrid are back in front against Liverpool crushing for Liverpool but what a goal from Gareth Bale. You don't see him any better now what an occasion as well he's only been on the field five minutes he's had both four touches what a goal that is. Now when the ball comes in you think no danger he can't he's gonna maybe he's up to bring it down maybe flick it on next thing he's in the air well what a goal that is and what a substitution as well that Zinedine Zidane on at the right hand it's just it's just an absolute wonder goal this as Kristin oh you don't score from there apart from then look at that. It's like Ronaldo has given it's stunning but this is the Champions League final. What a goal yeah well how many seconds before that did I mention Zinedine Zidane's goal that he scored at Handan Park seven and that goal might be the end of the hall that goal is that goal is better better better better oh yeah you're not getting any better more difficult job more difficult you're not getting many better now look at the manager look at that wow what a reaction what a goal Zidane what a goal a man who scored that goal I mean that is a tribute in itself the way that Zidane would what do you call that you're sort of flicking his wrist isn't it and snapping his fingers. Liverpool used to do that one so yeah Terry McDonnell Terry might use to do that. You um the thing now is with Liverpool just just get back to playing again well we've had to come from a goal down once already in this final and you've got to look John differences in the bench as you know you bring bail on they can know they could you know they could bring a censor on but you look at the Liverpool how are you going to change it. Cool that therein lies the problem doesn't it for Liverpool is that the poor city in terms of the substitutions they look a bit dead you know when they come off the place now it's really hard for them not this and don't as well but they have come off the place but they're not on the pace Liverpool they're on the good no look at Rowan oh no Natios Natios wanted ahead of Robertson and now Robertson trying to recover against Bale but he is able to be that in the ball as that brought back to Carrius but it is Real Madrid 2 Liverpool 1 we have 25 minutes to play I think the Spanish radio station behind us is still finishing off the commentary on the Gallup Bill Gold. I think I still got that is an amazing goal but was it better than Ronaldo's at Juventus away? Not sure but I think given given the circumstances I know but if we're talking about a goal yeah it doesn't matter what ratchet is would you say I still think Ronaldo's might say that. I'm going for Bales I think the game does make a difference and he'd only had four touches how do you score when you've only had four touches? I just never wore one. Yeah obviously you couldn't need one now you know why. I mean the buzz is still going around the Kiev stadium the Liverpool supporters obviously disconsolate you know it can only shock you to concede a goal like that Marcelo what a contrast between the two goals that Real Madrid have scored. Football? How mad is football? Marcelo swinging the ball across it was Marcelo's cross but Bale had so much to do with his back to goal and got the perfect contact what was he 14 yards out 15 yards out? See the look on the goalkeeper's face it was how on earth did that happen? Man that's why he's right with the first goal. Well for very different reasons but he got the perfect contact Bale struck it so cleanly and it arched into the top corner of the net so two-one to Real Madrid and Garret Bale we saw him scoring the final in Lisbon but this was something else and Liverpool now are you watching it again? I'm watching it never he's not watching that. Never tired so almost midway through the second half it feels like we've just seen such a and it feels like at this side in moment it was such a good goal. Well I think Liverpool have gone flat John Anthony yet they have. It's like whoa how on earth do we react from that? However there is still only one goal in it Real Madrid leading Liverpool by two goals to one on five live and here's Alan Green to take you through to the 90 minutes. Liverpool look flattened it was a stunning goal from the watchman. Now can Liverpool respond? Here's Lovren. Lovren with Alexander Arnglund the far side but he hits it long looking for Manny and forces the defender to put the ball out of play it's a throw in to Liverpool a third the way inside the Real Madrid half and now that's a good ball to Lanallan that is offside though free kick to Real Madrid. It's not a bad ball to play though Alan because it just makes you think a little bit Madrid at the back you know don't push out so easily so give Liverpool a little bit more room to play in front of them. It's trying to find that energy don't mark in 20 minutes to go basically and it's it's hard you can see that they've run it with steam slightly and it's very hard for the team to press and press and Real Madrid's confidence are up removing the ball around very well. You know you can't keep revisiting them in the well can you? In the end it wins out. Here's Robertson playing the ball in towards Manny. Manny sir always had an un-goal goodness gracious from Arnglund. He looked at it for almost there put the ball into his own net it's behind for a corner but he actually did brilliantly Alan did brilliantly. He did brilliantly. Manny comes to him he's just got to dink it over the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper's a normal. The goalkeeper's allowed the place at both ends. Roberts is okay and it's a Liverpool corner from the left Milner to take it 21 minutes to go here in the Champions League final played in towards the far post. Punch clear by Navas it's going ahead to play in the far side of the field for another throw in to Liverpool. I keep sticking it in there by the way he will make another mistake him. Looking for Alan pulling on that Virgil van Dijk shirt. He sounds surprised Alan. Every time the ball goes in any box. What gets me is that referees do not clamp down in that. All season the Premier League it's ignored throwing taken goes to Manny. Manny switches the play when Alden just inside the penalty back to Manny. Manny on the left for John hits the post almost 2-2. This game is over. Manny for me has been excellent and I've got to say you know he's been a threat when he's on the left he came on the right he went quite a little bit before the time but second half I feel like he's going to get back in the game it's going to be a little bit of a salamow and wasn't it cutting in from the right left foot. 20 minutes to go you're seeing a five line to World Service and Radio Merseyside on the BBC. Stick it underneath the crossbar don't foul the goalkeeper. Milner right footed in towards the goalkeeper but that was well caught by Navas admittedly he wasn't under much pressure and he throws the ball out towards this side of the field. It's an awful throw and it's straight out of play. Modric is furious. Navas apologizes. Ramos is furious. They're all furious. Well I said when Salah had to go off I thought he was the quieter of the front three. I picked Manny ahead of from you know Manny's had a great game. Here's Rolana. Rolana on to Ronaldo. Ronaldo just jinxed into the right. Alexander-Arnold into Ronaldo again. Ronaldo has two Real players closing down on them now a third so he's forced to clear back to Lovren inside the Liverpool half. 26 minutes played in the second half. Real Madrid lead Liverpool by two goals to one the first Real goal presented by frankly a disgraceful error by Carrius. Absolutely appalling. He has shown some good form of late but there are many Liverpool fans who have convinced Liverpool need a new number one goalkeeper. Mignol is probably away in the summer as well. Here Liverpool bring it forward. Passed by Ronaldo took an important deflection off the Real player and now Real play it towards Modric. He's got De Bale to his right. He's played forward to Ronaldo instead. Benjamin is available. Ronaldo into the penalty. Ronaldo he's thought about going down there. He did think about going down and there wasn't a challenge on him. He just thought about going down. Typical Ronaldo as it is he won the ball behind for a goal kick. Yeah. And I did well. He slid in as though to make the challenge and just withdrew his foot and just threw my run. I think once he slid in I think Ronaldo then can I thought he's going to make contact but he's forced to clear up all he didn't. Here's Henderson to Alexander-Arne the ball still inside the Liverpool half. Henderson needs to rally his troops. Back it goes to Lovren and now Van Dijk. Look how far the pitch Robertson is. Liverpool aren't going to go out with a run for that for sure. No. Ball is back with Karius again and Karius forward to Henderson. Henderson was under a little bit of pressure there but Henderson plays the ball back to his goalkeeper once more. You're going to come yelling instructions from the edge of his technical area. There's a downside on the edge too. Ball breaks kindly for Ronaldo. Ronaldo manning through the middle for Manitou is right. Firmino crosses the ball. Kifra goes. Firmino shoots and then it's saved him anywhere I think. It was upside against Milano. I don't think it was that handball. It hit him. It hit his arm but he's so so close. So so close. I agree with you. Yeah he never moved his arm towards the ball. No chance. That was a great ball through the middle. Controlled immediately. I know. Here's Ronaldo could finish Liverpool off and he shoots it wide. What a tackle that is. What a tackle by Robertson. Absolutely sensational tackle. That should have been the end by the way. I always bend them all. I ball up down the middle and now where is the defence. Brilliant tackle this is. Yeah brilliant. My word. Do you know something? It's not a corner. I know it's not. It's not a corner because Robertson played the ball into Ronaldo's foot. What's that fifth official doing there? He's up to the goal. He's only two foot eight away. It's such a nice uniform. He's in the program. Yeah it's how much is it costing the program. Anyway corner to Real Madrid. It shouldn't have been. Real lead two one. 16 minutes of the rebounds to go. Real Madrid heading for a third successive Champions League title. Corner plate short. Marcello back to Modric. Marcello's available again. Left of the penalty here. He crosses high into the box. The header back by Ramos. Liverpool keep the pressure on. They might counter attack here. I'll tell you what it's a big intersection that by Nacho. It's a big intersection Alan. Liverpool are all away. Yeah he's given a free kick here against Alexander Arnal for the tackle on Nacho. Corti's foot, Corti, Nacho's left foot. Has it been a booking? No. No. Well he went to book Marnay when they started arguing about seeing it was an elbow he changed his move. Yeah I think he looked at Ramos and thought very high. How can they give a card? Very tackle on Ramos. Very high Liverpool. Not the space to put that ball in. Liverpool do not concede a third. Not with a quarter of an hour to go. I knew the problem is the goalkeeper looks like he's trying to come and rectify his mistake here. It's chipped in. Either flies up or offside immediately. There are at least two Real Madrid players offside. Free kick to Liverpool. Be careful what you do with it Karius. Karius had Benzema close to him again. I think that was such a schoolboy mistake. Oh it's just awful. It's just a howler. No that was Kirlis initially from Ronaldo and now Real have it on the far side of the field. Searching for the killer goal. Good tackle though by the Liverpool captain Henderson. Finds Alexander Arnal. He drives it forward for Benzema. Certainly barged into Ramos. That should have been a free kick. It wasn't given. It's handball against Rolando. Was it handballed? We're a long way away. Really really quickly as well wasn't it? Trying to pinch it. You're in the clock. Yeah concern. Stick or twist time. What does he do? Well he's got nothing really to throw on. Well he could throw on Salanki. Yeah well you go a little bit kind of root oneish. Yeah maybe put Toklalana in behind. The front three we'll see. Anyway it's a Real Madrid free kick which has been rather wasted. When Albus passed back to Alexander Arnal wasn't great though. He finds Firmino in towards Ronaldo again. That was a loose pass by the Brazilian. Moderate takes it up. Firmino wins it back. Ball inside the centre so it goes with Lallana. That tackle by Firmino. Encourages the Liverpool fans. Now it's with Robertson. Back to the captain Henderson. Henderson to Lovren. Lovren takes it further forward. Ronaldo turns and runs away from Cruz. Good ball to Milner. Left edge of the fender. No cross in goodness. That hadn't been cleared by Varan. Lallana was there. But Liverpool have a throw in on the near side of the field. Great position in Varan as well to clear the cross. Throne back to Robertson. Now Van Dijk to Henderson. Real Madrid have got everybody back behind the ball apart from Ronaldo. There's the cross into their penalty area headed away. Lovren meets the head of clearance. Taps it back to Henderson. Square pass to the left of Van Dijk and on to Robertson. Robertson will want to attack at every possible opportunity. Henderson forward to Milner. Milner tackled. That was a dive by Nacho. Rightly ignored by the referee but he should have avoided it. Yeah, as soon as he saw the referee was giving nothing he was on his feet. Well they all do it. Now Firmino. Good play by the Brazilian. Holding off a challenge. Taps the pass forward. Milner level with the edge of the Real Madrid penalty. It checks under his right foot. Where is the ball going though? He's tackled by Modric. Birch. Challenge and now Cruz. Clears it. Straight to Liverpool's possession once more. Alexander-Arnold on the far side of the field. 13 minutes to go plus added time. Real Madrid lead 2-1. Alexander-Arnold passes forward. Took a deflection off a Real player. Didn't reach Firmino properly and Marcelo with the clearance to the captain on the far side. I said the captain. Ronaldo, he acts like the captain. You know it's me, me, me all the time. Here's Milner. Milner back to Ronaldo. Onto Manny. Liverpool's best player in the night. Manny runs away from one tackle. Can't beat the second tackle. Manny's gone down at the moment. I think he's okay. But Real have the ball. Run forward by Bayer which is completely ignored by Cruz. Well I think he started the pass. I think he started. He was just shifting the ball from foot to foot and he just didn't have that split second to deliver it. Casemiro to Cruz. And back to Ramos. Ramos who may well be lifting the Champions League trophy for the third season in succession. 32th time at all for Real Madrid. Are they in the better side? Yes, actually probably over the course of the play now. They have but I mean how mad is it that the first goal is given to them and the second goal is an absolute worthy. There's 35 minutes I thought Liverpool were good. Better side, looked the more likely to score and then they sort of come off the pace. I think they're looking for fans need to find another course. Have you never walked alone at the moment? Many of them are in despair. A way to a left. I don't think Liverpool may have exploited the flank. They've got in great areas in order to make them be there but the second half, it's all played men for. They're on the good dunk track, the full box. They let them run and they've not exploited it. They turn around to Ramos and quickly play forward to Cruz. Cruz just showed a halfway line. Good ball to the left side. Ronaldo, Bales well to the unmarked. Ball is back with Marcelo on the Real right. One-two played by Marcelo and then he gets the ball wide to Ronaldo again. I think Real are just happy to retain possession at the moment. They're the good of it Alan. Yeah they are good. They're going to do, get in front, keep the ball, invite the foul. Liverpool not hurting them at the moment. Moggish tries to turn the ball into the path of the Welshman but hits Robertson and it's out of play for throwing no one in any great urgency to take it. A little bit of an absence of clot at the moment on the touch line. It's going to be a shame. I wonder if he's having a chat with the coach and staff on what he's going to do next. Inside the last 10 minutes of the regular 90. Here's Ramos. Mani puts him under pressure. Ramos just got the ball back to his goalkeeper Navas and Navas now he swings his right foot and directs it towards Garret Bear, beaten in the air by Van Dijk but the judge runs to Nacho. No, Moggish. And do Casamiro and that's a loose pass by Casamiro but Milner unfortunately for Liverpool slipped and couldn't intercept properly. Now it's with Bale. Ronaldo through the middle. Arlval often the far side with Benjamin. Benjamin should save by Carrius. What a sensational pass by Bale. Unbelievable by the way. Well Carrius I don't think can quite make up for his error that led to the first real goal but he's trying hard throwing to Ray on the dribble on the far side of the field. It's with Benzema. Benzema to the left of the whole penalty here. Knocks it back to Marcello and that's Cruz. Marcello wants more. Liverpool can't get the ball. Yeah the other thing is all of a soon when you're starting to run backwards you don't all start to feel tired. John all that pressure Liverpool applied in the first half. No, Mani may well be the first car. Milner, yeah it is. Yeah Mani, Milner's just going through the crump. I saw Robin's car before. Oh Ramos again. Kelce, please. Here comes Emery Shan. No he's not coming. I'll go away please. He's getting a game done away with. Well Ramos waited. How do you know something? Why? The way he reacted was a disgrace Ramos. A yellow card for Mani and Emery Shan with his last minutes in a Liverpool shirt. Right so let's try and see what they're going to do now. Push one out of them over on the right a little bit. That'll be the same. Please just take one last push. But there's almost there's almost three of them holding hands there in midfield. Eight minutes plus out of time remaining here. Here's Real Madrid lead Liverpool by two goals to one. Here's Bale shooting from one way. What a mistake by Carrius. The ball hit directly to him and that is the end of Carrius as Liverpool's number one goalkeeper. That is a shocking error and Real Madrid lead two. Well there's no excuse and even if the ball moved a little bit in the air even if it moved his position in terms of his hands it was just nowhere near it. It kind of went through him completely. Yeah well Bale laid himself up and he does have a good shot. He's got to say he does have moves a lot. What did you say at that level? Just punch it away. Just keep it out of the net Chris. Ninety nine and a half times out of a hundred. You're saying that for fun. Bale's second goal of the game. His first was fantastic. His second and not his fault. No. Another goalkeeper mistake. He's hit it well by the way. He's come and saved. What is he 30 yards? It moves with a goalie. Oh. Why is he seeing a replay? It's a shocker. Why is the goalie falling to the ground? I really don't know. Oh my goodness. Patikake. Patikake. Baker's man on it. Tiro. Oh no. Well for so long Mille-Aix looked perhaps the better option for Carrius. Then Carrius got the number one vote from Jürgen Klopp. Now he's shown twice tonight that he ain't good enough. He's a goer as Liverpool's goalkeeper. He was actually watching the replay on the big screen opposite end. It's surely beyond Liverpool night. They must know that particularly with the clotting goal. Oh there he goes. Here's Kacke. Kacke goes on for a hat trick. Failing to the penalty area. Brilliant tackle. Ronaldo's asking for the pass. Should have played Ronaldo. I'm sure they've gone over. What are you on a hat trick? You know, he's got very excited there, didn't he? Yeah. And his last touch was like the heaviest touch he's had since he's been on the pitch. He goes past Henderson. Oh that's heavy, wasn't it? Loveburn does well with him. Very good. Great tackle by Loveburn. Put Loveburn in goal. Yeah, exactly. There's a Liverpool goalkeeper. I don't think he's shown tonight that both his hands are useless. How did you come back from this as well? You can't come back from this. Liverpool fans that in their despair tonight will be laughing at the very thought that Carrius is their number one goalkeeper. I don't think he's been playing all that. Sorry? Everybody said, oh great he's been the last three months. Improved. Better. Improved. That's all. Remember the shot from Roma where he left through his hands and hit the cross one, came out and that was at 0-0. No, just another corner. It just takes the wind out yourselves. Look at Liverpool. Look at them body language. Absolutely. Just completely. For example, very young Liverpool fans in tears. They're shielding their eyes. They can't believe that, you know, they'd be playing with a goalkeeper behind them and a schoolboy team who would make such mistakes. The ball is behind. It's a goal kick to Liverpool. Four minutes to go. Real Madrid fans can't believe they're good fortune tonight in having, in effect, two goals scored by the Liverpool goalkeeper. Yeah, mind you, the one that did score was worth it. Oh, it was wonderful. No denying that at all. Henderson, on towards Fremina, tackled by Casimiro and now it's with Ronaldo on the far side of the field. He rushes to keep it in play. He's sleeping. Ronaldo hasn't scored a goal tonight. He's tackled there and beaten and Alexander-Arnold just to the right of his penalty area. It's a 4-2 Ronaldo and now managed lockdown by Marcelo. Clever foul, isn't it? Again, this is what we talk about. Miles from your own goal. Bring him down. Ways 25-30 seconds. A little over three minutes to go. Plus added time. But not remotely enough. This is not Barcelona in 1999 when United trailed 1-0 going into added time. Silver spirit defined two added time goals to win the European Cup under Seraldox Ferguson. Liverpool look totally deflated tonight. Two goals behind. There's no coming back from this. Now, here's Henderson just over the halfway line. Henderson to Schaen and Schaen to Ronaldo. Still find out a very strange substitution. Bring Henry Schaen on. Once the lanky's on the bench. Well, he's just brought down with two light players, hasn't he? There's a cross into the Real penalty area. It's headed away. There's a foul. He had a look. Is it Nacho? Yeah, Fumio was a bit late. He's frustrated. You can see that. But Nacho had a look at the referee. Is there going to be a sensio coming on? Is it for Benzema? Will he take Ronaldo off? He won't take Rony off. Well, a sensio is coming off and he's coming on for Benzema. I thought it might have been. The sulk would have been enormous. Yeah, you don't take Norisco offending Ronaldo. Not unless you're absolutely sure that his career is on the dome. So it's funny that you talk about what happened. I don't know if you thought it was me at the stakes, but the game basically has done a little to a first 35 minutes before. Get yourselves in front. You've got a chance. They didn't. I really came back in the game after the outpot then. Real Madrid was all over XB in 65-70 minutes. Take control of the game. Knowledge, basically. We always said, I think, at the start of the game, not back in ourselves, but Liverpool to win needed to score the first goal. I think that was definitely key to this game. But Manny, having scored so soon after Real Madrid, took the lead while it might just have opened up for Liverpool. Maybe it was the psychological blow of losing Salah after 29 minutes of the game. Or maybe the fact that a goalkeeper was absolutely hopeless. And it could have been playing with 10 men there tonight. Liverpool wouldn't be much worse off. And I'm sure Minule, I've seen interviews with Minule and he's far too nice a guy to take any pleasure and carry his discomfort. But would he have been any worse Minule? It's chipped forward towards Manny. Manny into the penalty area. Well covered though by Ramos, the Real captain. And then Manny went the ball back and he's fouled. And it's a free kick to Liverpool. I know we've started Ramos off and say, you know, he's a clever professional. He's been good tonight. Very, very clever. He's been good though. Very clever. So Liverpool have a free kick, which Alexander-Arnold will swing in. He's come across to the near side of the field. Fourth official ready to tell us how many minutes they're being added on. I've added time. I don't think it matters. But it's three. Alexander-Arnold, six yards in from the Liverpool left touch line. Not far in advance of the front edge of the penalty area. Swings in towards the fire post, headed down. The lamb is there. His was a weak shot and it's taken away by Modric. And Modric clears it. Well, the way Juventus played, I did the final last year in Cardiff, the way Juventus played in the first half, four-one flattered Real Madrid. I just hope now they don't score a fourth goal. I can't see the clinic where they've got his two. He's basically kept what a goal. Mistaken, obviously. But it's just that they have a style of playing, don't they? And you think, oh, they look rattled. They look slow. They're not got anything going for them. But the person would be able to keep that ball moving, keep the ball moving. Yeah. Here's Shad. Wins. Two tackles. Ball breaks back to an alder, but he can't control it. He decided to play and soft for an alder. It's going to be a throw into Real Madrid on the far side of the field. It's an unbelievable achievement in today's modern football to win this thing three years, right? Yes, right now. Fully agree. And Zidane, the first coach to win three in success. Wonderful achievement. And still, some Real Madrid fans aren't convinced. Real on the attack. He's played in towards Ronaldo and that was the vital interception by Van Dijk. Ascensio, what a ball. What a ball. What a throwing. What a throw. It was a three ball. Corner to Real Madrid. We played half of the additional time. What do you say if you're the manager to the goalkeeper? Good guy. It's almost impossible, isn't it? Yeah. I don't know how you can say anything that could console him without the goalkeeper knowing that he's finished his Liverpool's number one. He must be on his way. After the Brazilian goalkeeper at Roma, allegedly, and yet, thinking all those goals that Liverpool scored against Roma. There must be many schoolboy goalkeepers better than Karius. Here's Henderson. Henderson plays it towards the left side. Liverpool player, apparently injured on maybe it's just a bit of cramp on the far side of the field. Robertson was well tackled. Real on the counter attack. And now it's with Ronaldo. Down the right side. Great first attack. There's a fan on the pitch at the moment. Inside the penalty where Ronaldo is. Ronaldo shoots and what is going on? Some village of lost an idiot. Well, I don't know who he represents, but he's entirely wrong. Thankfully, he's not wearing a Liverpool red shirt, but I can't tell who he supports. He won a 19 key. Have clinic, would you? Stroke jam. Maybe the night will be a year. There is the final whistle. The referee's had enough. Liverpool had enough. And Real Madrid are champions of Europe for the 13th time. No one can deny their pedigree. Liverpool certainly matched them with the first half for 35 minutes. They were the better side. But Real fans celebrate and Liverpool fans, the majority of fans inside the stadium can't emphasize that enough. Two thirds Liverpool for one third Real Madrid. And they're looking at Karius and thinking, what on earth have we got? One of the Liverpool outfield players has gone to the goalkeeper. That tells you all you need to know. What on earth would you say to him? For goodness sake. I mean, I feel really, really sorry for him. And I think the second, the second era was worse than the first area. The second era is we'd all would have stopped that. Yeah, but he doesn't need to do anything. No. He thinks somebody would go up, son. Well, that tells you, listen, every, every trick he tells the story. Why don't the players go, look, he's made mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes. And I don't want him going for me. But Real Madrid players who've gone to Karius. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very, very much. Dear, oh dear. Still, no Liverpool player has gone towards Karius. That Lovren is the nearest one. All right, a member of the Liverpool back post, asking to put his arm around him. No, Karius is crying. But there's no comeback from that. There is no comeback from that. As a player, but no, but I mean, you know, and as much as Scott will say about him, they look after him and everything like that. You hit the nail on the head before, and the crowd won't have it. No, the Liverpool supporters just, they just didn't will not have him. To be honest, it's a bit like Emory Schoen being brought on the substitute. Well, I think that's different. I don't think that any Liverpool fan would have appreciated that. Well, no, they wouldn't have appreciated it. But unfortunately, what's happened to the goalkeeper, you cannot, you cannot be at the club and come back from that. It is absolutely impossible, I'm afraid. I feel really, really sorry for him. But it was too rid, well, it was schoolboy Howard, you cannot describe them as any other way. Liverpool players are mostly dying on the pitch at the moment. It has not been Liverpool's life. There's no question. This is 1981. We visited, that's the last European Cup stroke Champions League final that Real Madrid lost. Alan Kennedy scored the only goal that night. But tonight, it's Real Madrid's win. And you have to say that on the balance of play over the 90 plus minutes, they deserve it. Yeah. And clots on amongst all the players, some of the other substitutes, generally all the players who played in the game. I don't think he's gone over to the goalkeeper. How can you be sincere? Well, controlling the keeper in these second stages. That's the point that I'm trying to make. It's what do you do? And it's unfortunate that the goalkeeper has almost become a bigger talking point as an absolutely wonderful goal from Gareth Baird. Absolutely brilliant it was, nothing short of. A couple of the Liverpool substitutes have gone up night towards Carrier. So see Danny Yings in the vicinity. Jürgen Klopp still hasn't made his way on the pitch. Oclet Chamberlain. They would have missed the player that came tonight. I think if you look at the team and you look at the game now, first 35 minutes, I thought everybody was on the game and looked good for Liverpool. And obviously Salah goes off, but if you actually look at the game overall, I thought the back four was done alright. I think the back four did okay. And I think Marnier was Liverpool's best player for me by males. And I think the back four in Marnier can really say they played up to their level which had been played. It's finished. Liverpool won Real Madrid 3.",
