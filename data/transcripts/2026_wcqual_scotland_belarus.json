  "transcript": " with Lewis Ferguson and Ryan Christie both suspended and Aaron Hickey picking up that injury that forced him off late in the second half. He's also changed both his centre back so Grant Hanley and John Souter have gone out. So, in comes Scott McKenna, Jack Hendry, Anthony Ralston, Billy Gilmore and Kenny McLean. Angus Gunn, he remains in goal. All in pink this evening, Angus Gunn, the back four of Andy Robertson, Scott McKenna, Jack Hendry and Anthony Ralston. A midfield of Billy Gilmore, Kenny McLean, Scott McTominay with John McGinn over on the left-hand side. Ben Gannon-Doke on the right and Chee Adams looking to add to his ten goals in a Scotland shirt up front. Scotland in their home kit, all navy blue with the yellow trim, playing from our left to right here at Hamden Park. Belarus in a sort of pale green colour, getting us underway, playing from right to left and it will be launched forward by their captain Alexander Martinovich. As Belarus look to launch the first attack into the edge of the left side of the penalty area being held up well and it has gone out for a Belarus thrown right next to the corner, flagged down on that left-hand side. Zabalin with the yellow hair band and the long hair just looking to get a ball in his hands but straight away Belarus showing that they are here to try and push Scotland back if they can. Well I think they are because looking at their team, they'll be suspected back three but they've got Ebon, they've got Grameco and they've got Barkowski who are all attack minded players on the pitch and Angus Chee isn't slowing going forward either so they're going to go for it. An opportunity to launch the ball into the area, it's cleared by Andy Robertson but only over to that far right side of the penalty area as the ball tries to come in Andy Robertson, gets the block in to deny P-Gas getting the ball into a dangerous area but from the start Belarus have come forward to try and put some pressure on Scotland and like Pat says it looks like it will be a back three. Lepaukic is in goal, Pavel Zabalin, Alexander Martinovich the captain and Jager Pakamenko and back three is a shot again, is blocked on the edge of the penalty area. Now Scotland have an opportunity through Ganondorf to move forward, he is on this right hand side he drops it back though to Anthony Ralsson just couldn't quite get the ball under control so I'll run you back through this Belarus team so Piazchenin on the left wing back position with P-Gas on the right then Ebon, Jablonski, Malyshevich and Grameko in behind the striker, Herman Barkowski who has just got that one solitary goal in a Belarus shirt. They don't have a lot of goals in their team but Max Ebon and Yevgeny Jablonski the two midfielders have nine between them, they are the two top scorers in this Belarus side and they will look to try and cause problems for Scotland on the break as they cross the half way line again P-Gas on that right hand side again providing an option but it's headed away from close range by Scott McKenna he's stunned him a little bit that header but he's okay the big centre back just a little rub of the head Yevgeny just smashed straight at him he's got his head in the way yet they've started very well the Belarusians getting down the right hand side doing that rugby start that most of the teams are doing just now and there's a real comfort and confidence about the team they have no points in this competition so far so it takes a wee bit of pressure they can go out and play there's no expectations on them and sometimes that releases players to play the best with them probably gives you a little bit of fire as well when the president of your FA calls you useless there's an interesting comment in the build up to this international window and that came before the 6-0 defeat to Denmark on Thursday night they will want to put that right and they continue to keep the pressure on here keep possession just on the half way line Peegath looking for that crossfield but ball over to the left hand side to pitching in it is a poor clearance from Ralston couldn't make anything of it Molesjevic has gone through to Angus Gunn but this is not what the Scotland faithful turned up at Hamden Park to watch no but they have to try and get a hold of the ball at something can they game down just a little bit there a little bit of pressure on Ralston there they put the ball in he caught in two mines and ended up heading it back into the most dangerous position but Scotland haven't got their game in order yet but it's not a panic it's very very early on Scotland start to slow you for 62 minutes over night but only three or four minutes in just now enjoying a bit of possession now Scotland as Billy Gilmore though under pressure forced to play the ball back to Scott McKenna and now back to Angus Gunn the other game in this group between Denmark and Greece taking place at 7.45 this evening that one could have huge implications on Scotland depending on what their result here is this evening a win for Scotland tonight a win for Denmark later on this evening and that would guarantee Scotland a playoff place at the very least for the World Cup finals as it comes across his left hand side Andy Robertson crossing in towards the penalty area dangerous ball but just too far ahead of Che Adams who gives him a little look at wasn't the ball that he was hoping for Che Adams but the ball goes out right or left particularly left hand side you're going to get a cross in quite early and it's up to make Tom and a to get in there as often as they possibly could wasn't able to do that this time Belarus going long foot race between Petchen and Rilesen which Petchen and wins but Kenny McLean comes to help out his teammate and now Ganon Doke has got the opportunity to run he's been released again in the 1-2 with Che Adams and now Ganon Doke level with the edge of the penalty area drives into the box looking to get the cross in just blocked at the end it nearly fell kindly to John McGinn right on the penalty spot but Belarus get it away and Ben Ganon Doke had green green grass in front of him there and he ran into it and causing problems he did but Zadolin looks if he was running and Trico will twang a kind of a dragon near him he's got his pace there so get the ball behind that full back and let Ganon Doke run Belarus coming forward but good defending from Jack Henry just putting the pressure on Barkovsky there centre forward tall centre forward Barkovsky plays his football in Poland but Scotland winning back possession and Robertson just happy to play the ball to Henry who looks to go forward now Scotland looking to get a little bit of sustained pressure it's been a good start from Belarus these opening five and a half minutes Rilesen out to Ganon Doke who looks already this evening Pat a lot more comfortable on that right hand side he is you know he's right for it but also that's where he plays most of the time the Belarusians are acutely aware of that they've got Zadolin playing it's almost back four actually just now but they've got Petchenin in front of him he's playing as the left midfield but the more the Ganon Doke gets the ball he will come back Petchenin will be dragged back and Ben Ganon Doke will be up against two players but that's fine because that creates space elsewhere but I think most Scotland fans are feeling the same get it out to this right wingers soon and it's quite as possible to give them space to be meant to nice drop of the shoulder for Mandy Robertson to get past his opponent he's played it into the path of Gilmore who's getting harried in that midfield and it's won well and now played forward looking again for Barkovsky he's got space he's into the left edge of the penalty he's got no support it comes along now and he plays it across the face of goal and it's gone over the foot of Scott McKenna it's going to be a corner for Belarus and that came out of nothing and that is where Scotland need to be aware very similar to the other night against the Greeks early on again the Greeks down the left hand side put the ball across and in this case the Greek centre forward missing absolute sitter exactly the same real ease I have to say I thought there was a question mark on the offside when the ball was first played but I'm incorrect just in the free frame there that was onside Belarusian should have done better with that a huge opportunity for Belarus the booze ring around Hamden Park for the corner kick as it's been prepared to be taken from the far side just rolled across the face of goal Barkovsky looking for a teammate that wasn't there but Scott McKenna didn't do particularly well with the clearance giving away the corner it comes in now one in the air by Zabalin but straight into the gloves of Angus Gunn and it's a little problem for John McGinn hobbling around in the penalty area at the moment he's up back up in his feet and Gunn plays the ball out to Scott McTomney had a quiet night on Thursday night Scott McTomney but certainly put in a power of work in that midfield he has been such a focal point in terms of goals scored for his country over the last couple of qualifying campaigns Scotland coming forward now Robertson down to the byline looking to cut the ball across it is defended well by Petchenen but he's getting himself in bother he's got help from his captain Martinovic and he's launched it clear and it will be a Belarus throw in just inside their own half up near the halfway line but again Andy Robertson showing pace I was a little bit surprised because when Robertson goes down the left hand side there you know there's a really decent chance of a good cross coming in and I looked in the middle and yes to some degree Adams was getting in there but I wasn't seeing Scott McTomney being his usual self breaking a leg to get into that box there he was kind of jogging into that so I was slightly surprised it's got a need to make sure they get bodies in the box Petchenen down the right hand side got support ball in now and it's cleared by Henry but only as far as Yablonsky who gets the shot away it will be another corner for Belarus good play from the visitors down that right hand side again and Petchenen already looking a real handful right there's no getting round it Scotland the second best just now we're nearly 10 minutes into the game there's a real confidence about the Belarusians just now we really haven't started playing yet not holding the ball much in midfield yeah we've got down the left a couple of times but at the moment Scotland being outplayed we'll be pushing it but the line share of the play and the line share of the decent half chances come to the Belarusians yeah it was a good cross from Malyshevich on that right hand side not dealt with particularly well by Henry here comes the corner kick and this time it is Henry who gets his head on it but all he can do is flip it behind for another Belarus corner under pressure from Parkimenko you can see Zablin coming in at the back he's really tall he might not be the quickest when he's chasing gun and dope but he's decent there and he's been marked by John McGinn he looks a good head taller than John McGinn in there this is a slight concern there's a few tall figures in this Belarus squad but it is the diminutive figure of Gromyko who will take this corner from the left hand side left hand raised and it comes out swinger looking for the head and that is a great header by Zablin the defender you picked him out Pat he got his head on that and went over Angus Gunn's crossbar though and now Scotland are trying to roar their team on they have to I mean if I can spot before the corner comes in where the problem is the problem is pretty obvious and they make sure that you know that the left centre back there is marked there they've got three big centre backs coming up so you know they have got numbers there but John McGinn was left absolutely for dead there clean headers seven and eight yards out that's on target that's a goal Scotland winning the ball in midfield but then giving it away but it's gone right back to Billy Gilmore he plays it through to Che Adams he's got past the defensive line into the penalty area looking to get on his right foot good shot away deflected it will be a corner kick just gone wide of Lupakov's right hand post and that was a wonderful ball from Billy Gilmore that is what he can bring you absolutely fantastic, as you see Billy doing those forward through passes he's brilliant holding the ball in the left field but those final third passes these are the important ones that's what you need against these teams that break through those lines that they've got there when they defend Clyde's eight Parklminkle did well in the end to get the block in and Martinovic the captain doubling up but the corner comes in left hand side in swinger punched clear by Lupakov, Ralston will pick that up he's not got many options and he is under pressure from Molesjevic so he's had to go all the way back to his goalkeeper but that was a little bit of intent from Scotland Che Adams getting in behind the defensive line great header one by Scott McTominay in midfield and now Che Adams releases Ganondog over on this left hand side this time he's got Andy Robertson just in behind him Robertson looks to get the cross and it's blocked but it falls to McKenna back to Henry inside the centre circle just over 11 minutes gone here at Hamden Park we're still waiting for the first goal Scotland trying to build themselves back into the game John McGinn looking to get the cross and deflected it will be another Scotland corner and Scotland beginning to get a grip on things Pat Nevin it was a really nice feeling that Scotland get two or three decent chances well not chances but good attacks getting into good positions when the fans are ready to get up for it so that will lift the team a little bit again I have a minor concern that when Scotland are breaking not enough players from midfield have hammering forward trying to get into that area this first goal for Scotland is so important having said that Scotland are not bad usually from corner kicks well in it comes front post it is cleared by Petchenin and now he will look to break he's got it back and he's got an option ahead of him through Malasiewicz but he's got Andy Robertson for company gets the ball down the line looking for Petchenin again those two are working really well down that right hand side Petchenin and Malasiewicz causing problems for Scotland as John McGinn turns away beautifully from the challenge of P-Gas but drops it back to Robertson and Scotland holding on to possession now Rallston looking to play it forward does so finds Che Adams great touch from Adams inside the penalty area he's got no support he's on the right hand side trying to get past Martinovic who gets a foot in and thwarts the Scotland striker another lovely ball over the top and it looks like that's where Scotland are going to get a lot of joy there's a great medal from Adams but that's what we know he's good at he will go and drive into the corners the inside forward areas hold the ball up giving these players a chance to get up and give them a little bit of help but as you say in the commentary there no support there's nobody up there with them it's imperative that Scotland push on a little bit more a throw in then which Rallston takes gets it back from Ganondoc looking for options Billy Gilmore is there but he tries to play inside which he does to Scott McTominay edge of the area Rallston gets it back now Gilmore back to Rallston Scotland just trying to work the opening to get the ball into the area there's now back in the centre circle with McKenna a couple of booze from the Scotland fans they want to see that ball thrown into the penalty area every opportunity yeah but you have to get into a decent area just don't lump it aimlessly this is nice from Scotland though some nice little one touch passing patience it has become something under Steve Clark Scotland very comfortable on the ball now it goes into the area it's not a great cross though headed clear by Zabalin only though as far as Henry who finds Adams lovely touch Adams there's the opening goal listen to Hefton roar but the flag is up it will bring cheers to the Smey Jack Henry fired the ball into Che Adams great touch from the Scotland forward to take it round the challenge of Martin Ovech and then he just rifled it into the bottom corner but then the Lineman's flag went up Pat Nevin they will have a look at it and it'll be tight it'll be very tight but you know it does not many Scotland players complaining too much about it so I think they know deep down that Che Adams might have been offside the ball is headed down there's a good header out there but when it's pinged in there I think he's on site I tell you what Pat I think the left leg has played him in off the gas Vadym Pirets left leg I think plays him on site the only thing that's going to not let go off is if Che Adams has handled the ball well he's controlled it for me that looks very very much like on site our Romanian referee Marion Barbu he waits as the VAR goal check signs are up on the big screens here at Hamden Park and Che Adams he also waits to see if he will be awarded his 11th goal which he is as Barbu points to the centre circle Che Adams with the opening goal at Hamden Park after a VAR offside check and now he roars and now he celebrates and missed Scotland players in Gullfam and he scores the opening goal here at Hamden Park Well and won Belarus Nils Sorry there really there was some edginess absolutely before that but the words we were saying before the game we get a goal in the first 20 minutes that will settle Scotland down there should be more of a comfort to it Adams as you just said a minute ago a minute before it Adams going beyond looks like the most dangerous things he did it there but what a wonderful touch he takes with his left foot first spins past the centre back then keeps calm it's not an easy finish from there he has to take it almost in a half volley flicks it round yeah it's a half volley keeps it low into the corner Scotland won there and breathes Well he had a goal against Belarus in the away leg he's got a or in the way tyre should say he's got a goal here at Hamden Park against them as well and now Hamden Park is on its feet and the celebrations begin it was a nervy first five ten minutes Belarus started very well but Pat you said in the build up to this game if Scotland score early on will be fine yeah and that's you can see from those first 15 minutes or so 20 minutes they were worried they were concerned when the Belarusians were breaking getting into good positions Scotland weren't at their best they were near their best this should come everybody down hold the ball play your own game and already as we see he's looking better there is a buzz about Scotland now their tails are up and they're beginning to just stroke the ball around the Hamden turf but Anthony Ralsson he's given it away and now Belarus will have a chance through Petchin and now on this left hand side to go forward Jack Henry there though to just calmly play it back to his goalkeeper as Scotland look to build and look to try and make this a more comfortable evening they have the early goal 18 minutes on the clock Scotland won Belarus nil and one thing Pat that I'm a little bit surprised at with Belarus is that they're not sitting in they come out they've had a goal this evening they have put pressure on Scotland but it has left space and opportunities for Scotland to get in behind they've played a 4-4-2 so leaving 2 up front that's a very open system when you're international level away from home so yeah they are they're having a goal and when they break they're breaking decent numbers as well and as you say that is leaving gaps for Scotland to break into and one of the good things is see the Clark has brought to this squad is the ability to play different types of styles and playing on the break when you've got the pace of ganondorf balls to the cleverness of Adams we'll show how well it can work long ball forward but Barkowski well offside so he just leaves it and McKenna heads it clear but now an opportunity for Gromyko to try and start something he finds Milisevic in the midfield but Belarus forced back to their captain Martinovic on the halfway line who Celtic fans may remember the captain of Karat Almaty who was the team that of course locked Celtic out of the Champions League in that final qualifier so he is back in Glasgow but he has seen his side concede his nation concede as Scotland win the ball back in the defence Sangus Gunn with an opportunity to go long Che Adams does well uses his body but it can't quite get the ball under control but Kenny McLean able to put pressure on in the midfield Belarus though enjoying a little spell of possession now they win a free kick just on the edge of the centre circle this was Che Adams there and he is playing on his own up front he gets a lot of help from McTominay coming behind him but he's up against two or something three players but the amount of times that Che Adams under that amount of pressure holds the ball up brings it down brings other players into play the thing that everyone asked about was the scoring goals well we're beginning to see that as Scotland scored now he had a hat trick against Liechtenstein albeit it was a friendly but that his 11th goal off his Scotland tenure in his 42 caps Che Adams later on this evening after us 6-6 coming up with Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton you can get your calls in from 7 o'clock call in and talk about whether you've booked your tickets for the World Cup yet or perhaps that is wishful thinking Pat push it a little bit just now but that's great hope and it's still at a level of hope and expectation but when Stabby Clark and all his team down there will be saying nothing for granted yes one now we know it's one now but we've already seen that this Belarusian team can create chances against Scotland and don't want to be greedy but the second goal wouldn't be bad now the good lot and down the right hand side Scott McTomney plays in Ben Ganondoc who's shown great feet to get into the penalty area Cross tried to just play it into the path of John McGinn was deflected out will be another Scotland corner well in terms of booking your ticket to the World Cup now it won't it will be a goal kick just gone out of play it off Ganondoc's own foot thought it got a touch on the way out but it didn't should have done a wee bit better Ben Ganondoc there I mean he's absolutely skinned his fillback again Zablin who's Zablin looks to me like a centre-back clean left back and that's not good that really isn't good he's not mobile enough they can't change direction enough and when asked to turn and sprint he's not getting close to Ben Ganondoc if any winger who's a winger who wants to go beyond players will tell you they love seeing a big lumpy centre-back clean against them they're in the wing so if we can get Ben Ganondoc the ball off and as possible he'll get beyond him but he needs to have better service after that Scott McTomney does well just gets in ahead of Martin Ovec he goes down looks for a free kick right on the edge of the penalty area but none given by the referee and now Belarus come forward again Barkovsky on the right hand side now plays it in to Gromyko who is about 25 yards out central just looking to play it back to the striker but Robertson does enough to get the block in Belarus win it back though and here is Zablin playing on that left back and as Pat said he is traditionally a centre-back for his club team plays his football in Cyprus he has started the last 13 internationals for Belarus usually the starters are centre-back the left centre-back of the three though it's a very very different position again as you say if you spin the career out in the wing you know that's a joy generally the amount of players that can play those two positions and play them incredibly well is limited especially a really tall player like him who's in guessing 6-3-6-4 Gannon Dope will now try and drive forward which he does takes on Gromyko leaves him on the floor and now he gets the ball into the area edge of the penalty box with Scott McTominay plays it back to Dope tries to put the left foot cross in but it is well blocked by Petchenin out for a Scotland throw and Petchenin felt that one just hit off his ribs he's asking for a little moment and I think he can have a wee moment there I think it missed both of his legs looking at the way it's playing just now Ben Gannon Dope you can't take your eyes off him really can you because of that pace he's got any brown positions I would say up until getting to that byline he's been a 9 out of 10 so far once he's got there he's been about a 4 you know the delivery hasn't been good enough hasn't picked out players hasn't put it into dangerous areas he's miss kicked a few straight out of play that final bit is often the final thing that they learn you know in that sort of position but if you keep on giving them ball eventually it'll work today for them he hasn't had a lot of football this season since his move to Bournemouth as Ralston delivers but easily cleared by Park Gomenko out for a Scotland throw in just midway between the halfway line and the edge of Belarus's penalty area but yeah Ben Gannon Dope not had a huge amount of football to play this season just three appearances for Bournemouth but he did get a wonderful assist in the last game against Fulham for Semenyuk he's not a bad player Semenyuk he's doing wonders for my fantasy team I can tell you wow he's got some to it Hendry looking for options ahead of him tries to dink it forward to Trey Adams but didn't get enough on it took the nine iron needed the seven iron there Jack Hendry as Scott McKenna wins the ball off Malashivich and now Scotland come forward left hand side with Robertson and now McGinn who scampers clear of the retreating Malashivich he's not got much ahead of him but he's played the ball forward nearly got on the end of it and needed the defensive intervention from Martin Ovis to stop McGinn getting into a really dangerous area look at me there's a wee tiredness about John McGinn sometimes you know and that for a lot of players he goes isn't that terrible the reason why that is sometimes with John McGinn is he gives 100% 100% of the time so now and again he can look a little bit leggy but in that situation there are three players around him he got past two of them and it's only the third player that managed to stop him in the strikes right well let's get an update from the WSL Liverpool against Manchester City with Charlie Sleeter it's goalless here at Anfield 42 minutes ticks over on the clock here all Manchester City all the time Alba Fugino has just had the best chance well saved by the goalkeeper no no it's a goalless there it was a full card of WSL fixtures today Aston Villa against Leicester City finished goal is Chelsea were one no winners against Tottenham thanks to Akira Walsh wonder strike Everton lost for one to Manchester United London City Lionesses with a win one no against West Ham and Arsenal won the winners against Brighton you can watch all the highlights of the WSL today on the women's football show that is on BBC One tonight at 11.30 there is also full commentary on Liverpool Manchester City on BBC sounds should you wish as Angus Gunn just picks the ball up Belarus trying to get down Scotland's left hand side again and Scott McTominay now going clear and you mentioned John McGinnis played a lot of football this season already John McGinn started every game for Aston Villa scored three goals as well he's been on great form yes the thing about John McGinnis three games for him sometimes means six games for other people but the work they put in and the effort is I think he has only got two speeds full speed and stopped yeah he is the player who has played most under Steve Clark since he came in in May 2019 he's been a very pivotal part to all the success that Scotland have had him and a number of players it's been a fairly consistent squad over this last period of time as Robertson tries to flick the ball into the path of Che Adams inside the area but it is cleared Kenny McClain now under pressure wins the ball Gromyko I think was looking for a free kick as he went up to challenge for the header not getting it and now McClain gets a sore one from Gromyko and this time the referee will stop it Willie know he's going to play on but his whistle to his lips he thought about it as Ganondoc faces up Zabalin again again does well gets the byline cuts it back and again and is cleared that was better from Ganondoc though with the delivery honestly Ganondoc could go by his left back Zabalin with his eyes shut now right this is if he isn't there right so he's going to be at Malday long if you're a Belarusian manager you cannot allow that to last for any more than a second more and as I say that the full backs tension is come back in Marathon there is no way you can allow that to happen but the good thing about that this that drags the Belarusian team back you have no get five at the back here's McTomay trying to spin away from Zabalin but Belarus do well and then a free kick is given away by Billy Gilmore right on the edge of the D as Petchman he's he's got a tough shift today Petchman because he he does go back to make it a back five but then he's also being charged with trying to create an outlet and the further up the Petchman he's problem is he's just our position is badly our position and he's playing against exactly the wrong type of player that he would like to play against and to be fair as a part of it Petchman who should be helping him isn't helping him isn't getting back there so Ben Gannon and secretly they see the clock shouting at him saying get your feet in the touch line here get chalky your boots you stay out like you'll get the ball when you've got the ball you will be the defender Well it's a sore one in the middle of the pitch I think is the striker Barkoski who's gone down and instantly he's waving to the technical area and now the referee does say to the medics to come on as we just approached the 30 minute mark here at Hamden Park Scotland with that one nil lead thanks to Che Adams and Barkoski looks to be in a lot of pain here Well he's holding his eyes and his forehead which you know may well be a little slanted across the face but we've got a little yeah yeah he's right I think there was a finger maybe in a hand certainly in his eye there It looks a nasty one actually on the replay there from Scott McKenna his fingers just going around the eye area off Barkoski something you see more on a rugby field than on a football field that sort of injury and it's certainly very much frowned upon on a rugby field Yeah it is one of those ones I had a wee nervous glance up at the scoreboard there you know you don't you start looking at that that's quite dangerous play I'm not saying it was you know deliberate or anything like that but the arms are up and the fingers going into his eye seriously seriously dangerous play there but as I say I don't think it's dangerous delivery Well let's head back to the WSL Liverpool against Manchester City Charlie Sleetow Steel goalless now inside three minutes of first half stoppage time and the pattern of the game well set Manchester City well on top Liverpool Steel trying to find their first point of the season and as things stand there halfway there it's no no Manchester City looking for that win that will take them back into second place in the WSL and a point behind Chelsea Liverpool meanwhile looking to get their first point of the season We're back underway here at Hamden after that slight break for Barkowski to get some treatment he's back on and Belarus have the ball inside their own half and the ball across the top was perhaps available there for Barkowski he made a little darting run but it wasn't spotted by Martinovic but they come forward through Gromyko and now through Peschenin who plays it inside but Kenny McLean reads it well wins it back Ganondoc trying to skip away from a couple of Belarus players which he does very well he's now driving forward and this time though Zabalin gets his challenge right and stops Ganondoc for the first time in this game Yeah first time but it was one of those last-ditch tackles and he goes to the ground there and he gets a thrown it had he not done that he's done again to McTominay edge of the area now Robertson cross the cross looking for Che Adams who gets on the end of it but it's deflected and Che Adams is down on a heap and Andy Robertson is asking for a penalty lovely play from Scotland down that left hand side the ball cut across to Adams he was under pressure from Zabalin I think it was and he went down but nothing given so far from the referee Che Adams looking for something as well but Scotland players were instantly looking towards the referee there I have to say Zabalin looked a little bit nervous as well Zabalin's better in there because he's playing a centre-back position he goes in to be fair he comes in at a terrible angle to tackle Che Adams but I think he still gets the ball Well it is a goal kick for Belarus Che Adams getting the final touch as he was under pressure they're still not taking it yet now the VAR potential penalty check comes up on the scoreboards here at Hampton Park but it is very brief and we are back into play I really couldn't see that I thought Zabalin was having an interesting game he's just trying to pass there with his left foot and outside his left foot and it's went so badly wrong I always feel sorry for players when they're asked to do a job that they're not built for they're not right for and he is having a weirdly difficult time in that left back position Quick throw in from Belarus though down the left hand side which Scott McKenna has to come over before Milashiewicz can start something threatening Well there is Belarus on the ball once again Just looking at the way the Rodgersons are still way way way back there Do you know what you watch the Belarusians playing here? They're actually quite good middle to front I see that a lot about quality up front So far it doesn't look very good at all and it's not been impressive I think it must be a half time over the Liverpool game Yes still goalless between Liverpool and Manchester City In that game it was a busy afternoon in the WSL today You can catch up on all the news and stories from it on the Women's Football Weekly podcast Ben Haynes, Ellen White and Jen Beattie You can get that on BBC Sounds and there's more women's football coming your way as well during the week Chelsea against Paris FC in the Champions League Both of those teams drew their opening Champions League group game That will have live commentary on 5 live and BBC Sounds Wednesday evening For that one as Belarus do well to get the ball clear now Milashiewicz just crossing the halfway line He's got support on that right hand side from Pigas Back now with Martinovich and across with... It goes to Gromyko, he's trying to get it under control but he manages to keep possession Belarus being allowed to play with the ball a little bit in their own half by Scotland Now John McGinn scampers forward to try and put pressure on the goalkeeper as he clears it And ends up passing it straight to Ralston on the halfway line But is this part of what Steve Clark will want to be seen from a Scotland team? No need to run the legs off yourself, again last 90 minutes They're going to go up just now, draw the opposition out now and again I think it's actually quite clever what Scotland did there, just hung off a little bit And then John McGinn realised wait a minute their goalkeeper is not that good in the buttoll Just close him down and he'll give you a back and that's exactly what happened So quite clever from Scotland there Aurora's Kenny McLean slides in Quite efficient hasn't he Kenny? Kenny McLean's been quite efficient Don't know the hard ugly what they're... Billy Gilmore is lovely tonight But she gets the ball and passes it well, Kenny's done the ugly stuff 52nd cap for Kenny McLean and he is certainly a player that Steve Clark has used and trusted Throughout his tenure, the Norwich captain as Belarus come forward Passioning in a more central position, he's moving out to this left hand side There isn't anybody there for him now, he's got support from Zabelin Plays it back to Parkimenko and across to Martinovic Again Belarus with the ball amongst their defensive players Scotland just trying to force them backwards a little bit Trying to force some mistake but it's nice from Gromyko playing it into the path of Barkovsky Takes the shot from distance and it whistles over the top of Angus Guns cross-bary Through a hand up but I think he knew it was always going well over the top Yeah he had it covered there, that's not bad to happen, it was a good little period to play there From Belarus, she'll get lifted by that There's an odd game, I have to say I don't think Scotland are playing brilliantly I'm playing a lot better, it's quite controlled but they're not chasing anything But control of the game at home, win the lot against Belarusia The only thing that's missing just now is control of the game Holding a lot of the ball in midfield and being comfortable in possession It's not been quite as much of that as Scotland have had in the past against some of the smaller teams Yeah they certainly dominated the away game which took place in Hungary 73% possession for Scotland, 14 shots in that game They won it 2-0, they lead this one by a goal to 0 But again it's Belarus coming forward with Moleshevich He's looked very lively in this first half Just making his third cap This evening he started the last game against Scotland and that was his international debut The 22 year old, but he's looked lively He's been at a threat at times Belarus go over the top but that's not going to clear John McGinn Who plays the 1-2 with Andy Roberts and takes a heavy touch but the clearance is canoned off McGinn And he's now looking to try and put pressure on Moleshevich Who plays it back to his goalkeeper And goes long into the darkening sky here at Hamden Heading clear by McKenna, it will be another Belarus throwing You get a little sense that there's some frustration creeping in amongst the stands here Absolutely, you can feel it It's went quite quiet around Hamden Park I think the fans know and everyone knows the importance of this game, the importance of these three points If you get the second goal, Scotland can manage to get the second goal then it's party time Well played from McGinn to release Roberts and Roberts and deep cross looking for Ben Gannon-Doke It's over the top of his head, he's perhaps not got the stature to be a back post attacking in the air I'll give Gannon-Doke a pass on that one Because I've been looking and thinking, you know, trap the back post, get in there, get in there, get in there Because he's not been getting in there from cross this one less quick enough This time he's done what I thought and then I'm thinking, I should stay out Because he can then attack the ball, so hey, well done Ben You try to get in there, try to do the right thing, the ball is just above you, the same, it reached you Belarus with a throw in that goes all the way through to Jack Henry Henry finds Gilmore and McKenna inside the centre circle Scotland now beginning to just string a few passes together Henry's got Ralston who he finds on this right hand side And Ralston plays it forward for Gannon-Doke who takes that sore one as you hear from the scream from Gannon-Doke Has the challenge come in from Yablonsky, catches him right on the ankle As he goes down with a little bit of a yelp He looked almost to me as if he twisted his ankle when he went down there I wonder if it was as much as a kick as a little twist of the ankle when he went down He didn't enjoy it anyway, the referee's going to go over and have a word I mean, he's the oldest one in the boot, a quick player who's given you a tough time We're trying to slow him down by giving him, as we would say in Scotland, a dull one To be fair, I think that's as much Gannon-Doke as we would see He's actually thrown his leg towards the defender as much as he's been kicked So I was wondering about a yellow card, but I think the referee's made the right decision Not giving a yellow card back Well he is back up in his feet, he was over just catching his breath But he's back involved in the play, finding Adams and now the ball wide to McGinn And to Robertson, first time cross, looking for McTominay, cleared by Martinovic And it will be a Scotland throwing level with the edge of the penalty area McLean and Robertson exchanging passes, and it will be McLean who now launches in Left-puted, McTominay's in there, but headed clear, now Gromyko gets up ahead of Gilmore But it's fallen to Rallston, and Scotland will start again with the ball back at Angus Gun A lot more to come in terms of these European qualifiers, World Cup qualifiers I should say, Northern Ireland against Germany, that is tomorrow Germany, Northern Ireland and Slovakia, they are all tied on six points in a very tight group You can watch that on the BBC iPlayer and BBC 2 from 745 And then Gannon-Doke picks up the ball right into the penalty area, looking for the cross And again, it's easily cleared by Parkemenko, it will be a corner kick though Gannon-Doke just not finding his target with his delivery, still looking a little bit gingerly on that right foot Hoping around a little bit That's good, so on this occasion there, you're wide in the right, there's nobody closing you down You've got your only 10 yards from the bi-line, you've got to flank it in such a way that you're attacking To this you can go and attack it, but Scotland get a corner They do, which will be taken by McGinn into the area, it's headed clear to the edge of the box Gannon-Doke just gets it away and Gromyko does well to leap ahead of Andy Robertson But it falls to Ralston, Ralston launches it into the night sky Scotland just struggling to gain control, that one's taking a flick off Billy Gilmore as it's gone out of play So it will be a Belarus throwing, also tomorrow night Wales against Belgium Wales are currently third in that group, a point behind Belgium and two points behind the leaders Macedonia who play Kazakhstan, so Wales against Belgium, massive game for Wales Full commentary on Radio 5 Live tomorrow from 7.45 and that is also on BBC 3 and the iPlayer So you can watch that and then on Tuesday night England can book their place at the World Cup with a victory When they take on Latvia and full commentary of that will be available on Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds So a busy close to this international window and Scotland lead here against Belarus by a goal to nail As we approach half-time and they know that a victory tonight coupled with a Denmark win over Greece later on this evening We guarantee Scotland a playoff place at the very least Scotland at the moment ahead of that game between Denmark and Greece looking to go top of the group But Gannon-Doke spins away from the challenge of Parko Menko driving into the penalty area Right but it's shot, good save from the goalkeeper He decided to go himself that time Gannon-Doke causing all sorts of problems getting in behind that defence And all LePouk of Cadou was flicking round the post for another Scotland corner Good decision there Gannon-Doke, that for me is his best moment of the game so far The dummy to get past the defender this time which probably only fit the 14th time He's got past him there, but there's not really that many options You're getting closed down so the shot on target, nothing wrong with that Gannon makes a decent save So John McGinn again on this right hand side will launch a left-footed cross in from the corner kick Looking for options and it comes, it's on towards the goalkeeper who punches clear and he gets the free kick He goes down the goalkeeper, how much contact there was Well it's quite clear what's happening now, Scotland believe that the goalkeeper, I don't think there's anything for me for Lafacot there I didn't think there was anybody near him But he will not catch a ball, wherever it is, if it's right in front of his chest he will punch it So Scotland know that and Stevie Clark knows that as well, so just put it in there Because you only need to get one punch slightly wrong, get a player in front of him That time I think you like yourself, I think the goalkeeper is very fortunate to get a free kick for that one It goes long and Belarus win a free kick just inside Scotland's half As Barkowski challenges for that aerial ball with Scott McTominay And it is the Napoli midfielder who is penalised as the board goes up Two minutes of added time we will have here in this first half The first half that Scotland lead through Tchey Adam's goal but Peschenin launching it into the area to try and spark something for Belarus Cleared by Henry and now with Ganondoc on this right side, this time he looks for a crossfield ball I'm not sure that option was really on for impact How subtle of you to say it that way, it was not a good ball at all Two minutes of added time you won the look and again it has been Ben Sting Ben has been throwing it, he's probably mad at them actually in the first half in Ganondoc But that final ball, that final bit of decision making is young, he's learning But if he can keep that pace, that's a quite hard tackle there was that On the left hand side there was the referee, actually I think the referee has forgotten to bring his cards out today Something is not a bad thing That does look like a sore one indeed on Billy Gilmore on that left hand side Just caught very late, went down in a heap but he's back up I'm okay with that one, I'm alright, again it's a strong tackle, it's probably a foul It's sounded bad but Billy Gilmore will recover okay Max Ebon, he's been very quiet here this evening Ebon, Belarus' top scorer in this squad that they have Again Ganondoc, Wriggelsquare driving and goes left footed, it's taking a deflection And Lopukov was watching that all the way as it was heading towards his top corner But he managed to just reach up and stop it In its tracks as Belarus look to then launch their own attack which Scott McKenna has to go and clear up And it's gone out for a Belarus throwing level with Scotland's penalty box Which they have taken quickly and now Ebon on the ball brings in his international and club teammate Martin Ovech And Ebon looks to play it into Gromyko, edge of the area, Gromyko going for an overhead kick Well that would have been sensational in the end, it was not and it is the last action of this first half And it has been a little bit of a strange first half here at Hamden Park Scotland doing what they need to do though by getting themselves in front But Belarus have come and caused more problems than I think many of the supporters inside Hamden Park Would have wanted to see but when Scotland needed somebody to show that little bit of class, that little bit of composure And they had to cause their man up front Chey Adams who had it, flick the ball over the challenge And then rifled it bottom corner, he's walking off the field just now giving a wee wave and a kiss to somebody in the crowd He's delighted, his 11th goal in a Scotland shirt, it had Scotland ahead at the break But Pat Nevin, it was an interesting first half Interesting is one way to put it, I don't think Scotland have been at their very very best But there have been moments and as the half has developed, Scotland has got more and more control And I think the Belarusians side have got a little bit more tired, a little bit more ragged They've lost the faith they had early on in the game a bit If Scotland get a second goal, this game is finished, but they need to get that second goal Adams has scored the goal, but he's also been pivotal, there's a lot of the play Good to see Billy Gilmore getting involved in a lot of the play as well But let's be fair, it's been been gaining dopes half when you watch it Every time he gets a ball, he absolutely skins the place where he's playing against Sabalin So as I said, I'm going up to 9.5 out of 10 for Ben Gannon, Dork at the moment Until his final ball, and the final ball has actually been well below par But you know, keep on giving the ball, eventually he'll do the right thing But he's been classed today Well as the Sky Darkens here at Hampton Park, after a first half that has seen Scotland dominate the possession But it's two attempts on target from both sides, Scotland are the ones to take their chance And it is Scotland won, Belarus Mill Well, and Pat, I was just watching on my monitor Steve Clark walking off the pitch alongside Ben Gannon Dork, so I wonder if he was whispering those same messages that you've just been telling us I mean, the other thing to bear in mind here is that, I mean, goal difference potentially could be quite crucial in this group, so we need to see more from Scotland's second half, don't we? That's a very, very good point, and you will start to consider goal difference when you get the second Before that, you're thinking of the points, exactly how it works Because if you start thinking of goal difference this point, timing, fly forward, you can get caught in the break I mean, Belarus aren't the best side in Europe, but they aren't utterly and completely hopeless They are capable of breaking the... I've got one or two decent technical players and you know, you don't want to make that slip banana skin, so, yeah, keep on doing the right things, wait for the gaps to open up Keep on giving the ball to Ben Gannon Dork, and hopefully the final ball will improve in the second half When, if and when, I add that quickly, if and when you get the second goal that they're Scotland then consider You might even bring on another centre forward and really go for it, because what we do know, and I think what you're Alluding to there is that when they go down, the Belarusians can collapse So yeah, goal difference important, but after goal two Well, they went down 6-0 earlier this week, what about second half then? Scotland leading by a goal to a nil, sorry, against Belarus at Hamden Park So second half commentary to come, I guess so far so good in terms of, as Pat was saying, three points will be heading Towards Scotland's way, and the way it lines up tonight, if Scotland get a win and Greece fail to beat Denmark later, that one's a 745 kickoff, then Scotland will have at least guaranteed themselves a playoff spot For next summer's World Cup, but a big 45 minutes to come, we'll bring you that here, but with the time at 5.51 Let's get the latest news here on 5 Live with Nick Hatfield The Voice of the UK This is BBC Radio 5 Live Thank you Katie, good afternoon Hamas says it's transferred living hostages holding Gaza to different locations ahead of their planned release tomorrow Israel says the bodies of the dead hostages will be forensically identified Speaking to NBC's Meet the Press, the US Vice President JD Vance says it's a huge moment It's a monumental thing, it's great of course for their families, but I really do think that it shows what happens When you go outside their traditional failed diplomatic routes and actually try something new While people in Gaza have been collecting aid from dozens of lorries entering the territory, footage shows residents carrying sacks of food through the streets Police and mountain rescue teams on the Isle of Skye are searching for a German walker, 57 year old Matthias Betten who was last seen in a car park before he was due to climb Blarvane The Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson insists the National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell wasn't involved in discussions about the substance or evidence in a case against two men accused of spying for China The case was dropped last month with prosecutors saying evidence couldn't be obtained from the government, the government has blamed the previous Tory administration A man has been charged with stalking the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davy and his family over a period of four months, Inigo Rowland, who's 58, was remanded in custody And UK travellers have been completing new checks including fingerprint scans and photographs as they enter the European Union There have been reports of non-EU passengers arriving at Prague airport facing delays of up to an hour and a half Our reporter Guy Hedgeko is at Madrid Airport where officials say the initial rollout has been successful But it's over the coming weeks and months that we're going to see greater numbers of travellers So I think the big question is how will this system in Spain and in other countries across Europe as well, how's it going to manage those greater numbers that we're going to see over the coming months as this system is rolled out That's the BBC's Guy Hedgeko at Madrid Airport On BBC iPlayer Women like us are invisible Do you want to be in a rock band? Sometimes you just need friends to turn up the volume Is everybody ready? What's your band going to be called, Brandon? The old bag's department What's their songs about being middle aged and menopausant? We're going in five We're going to nail it From the writer and creator of Happy Valley This is our time, we need to grasp it Riot Women starts tonight on BBC iPlayer This is Five Live Sports with Katie Smith Listen on BBC Sound So we'll be back at Hamden Park shortly We're at Scotland One Belarus Nil in their World Cup Qualify the goal from Che Adams The difference from the first half We're checking on the WSL in just a moment But let's go to the Women's Cricket World Cup Where India set Australia that mammoth record target 331 for the win, Henry Moran is getting pretty tens Goodness me, this is the game that we hoped it would be 13 needed from 12 deliveries for Australia to chase down What would be a record in Women's ODIs? 331 the target And adding to that as well the drama of Elise Perry Having come back out, having retired her She's not out on 40 Australia seven wickets down The pressure is on in a big way No question about that But it is going right down to the wire With that there's going to be a single taker As they're not quite dot ball It is now 13 from 11 for Australia to chase down 331 What a fantastic finish, you can listen to that Over on Sports Extra Big chance at Anfield in the WSL This one being watched by Charlie Slater And now a big goal completely against the run of play Liverpool are in front with six minutes played In the second half a brilliantly inviting ball From the right wing, curled to the back post And there's Cornelia Kappox with the header Her second goal of the season is also Liverpool's second goal of the season And they lead against Manchester City by one goal to nil Oh is Gareth Taylor going to get the upset Against his old side, we'll keep you updated there It's been a busy day in the WSL Five matches already completed Chelsea ended their two game winless run As they beat Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 At Kings Meadow earlier this afternoon The goal came from Kira Walsh Long range effort, her first for the club And she spoke to us after the match I think it was really important we won But more importantly that we played a good game today And I felt like and the rest of the girls Felt like we played good football And yeah that's something that we want to build on now And keep doing in the rest of the games You said pre-season that you wanted to win With a specific side of football Not just find any way to win or win any costs We just spoke to Sonia and she said she felt like That was probably the most complete performance That she's seen, would you agree? Yeah I would agree I think Especially the first half The way we kept Tottenham pending They were really really struggling to get out of their box And yeah I think the only thing that was missing today Was maybe just the final pass The final shot, the final action I don't think it was a bad performance I think we created a lot and we played some Really really good football from the back to the front So yeah it's a good performance to build on One thing that wasn't missing was a winning goal And it was you that got it Sonia said also she wasn't surprised That you scored from that area That's nice because I was Five out of seven of your WSL goals Have come from outside the box Is this something you're just practising a lot more Of in training and how confident are you feeling? I think we spoke about it at halftime And all the girls and Sonia always tell me to shoot But I think it's a lot easier when We did have good possession and we were in control And they were obviously sat a little bit deeper I think as a holder midfielder I can get up the pitch a little bit more and help So yeah I didn't know it was going in As soon as it left my foot I scored the game winner so yeah I'll take it Kira Walsh then the match winner for Chelsea With Nive Carr and those stats Meaning she now has the joint highest percentage Of goals scored from outside the box By any player in the competitions history In the WSL Arsenal also got a win They beat Brighton 1-0 at the Emirates Their first across all competitions In five games, let's hear from the boss René Slagas We're really happy we got the three points We're back winning, we're happy with the clean sheet The team worked really hard to keep the clean sheet For us and happy with the goal of course Going forward I think at that time in the first half We were good and we had a lot of possession In the attacking half but yeah no Most importantly three points today No trophies are won at this stage of the season They're in six months time Are you confident that things will improve From a performance level and you'll get Arsenal ticking again Yeah of course of course there's a belief Because we know what we're capable of And for us how we see it There's fine margins that we definitely We feel like we have control over That we can work on But we know the quality in the squad The belief is there and We'll get back to our best ways But most importantly now when We've had a tougher time we're so happy Getting the win and even if the performance Wasn't our best and we still get the win And that's most important right now René Slagas with Rob Nothman At the Emirates Let's head back to the cricket We've got a result Henry Phenomenal performance from Australia Annalise Perry has hit six down the ground To win it a record run chase 331 the target They've got there with three wickets In hand and an over to spare Perry limped off injured back out After cramp finishes 47 Not out Australia win by three wickets Henry thank you so much what a game Right next couple of minutes Before we return to football I just wanted to touch on this amazing Story we've had today at the Shanghai Masters Tennis in case you might have missed it This is a Masters 1000 event It's just below the Grand Slams And the ATP Tour Finals This story has a touch of the Emirate Kani winning the US Open about it There's just so many elements that make it remarkable So let's bring in our correspondent Russell Fuller Russell if we just paint the picture first We've got Valentin Vacherot against Arthur Rindaknash and you wouldn't Say these listeners Our listeners may have heard of these names But they're more than just opponents aren't they Yes and they could be forgiven for not Knowing a great deal about these players Especially the champion Valentin Vacherot because he was 204 in the world before The Shanghai Masters in fact You'd only ever won one Tour level match in the main Draw on the ATP Tour Before the last 10 days And he's won the title He beat Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals He beat the world number 11 Holger Runa In the quarter-finals having come through Qualifying he's won 9 matches And who should he beat in the final His cousin And they grew up together in many ways Even though Rindaknash is a few years older They played together at Texas University Around about 7 or 8 years ago They were on the same team for a year And by the sounds of things they were wishing each other well Throughout the week congratulating each other On their achievement on the family WhatsApp group It also means his prize money Russell £824,000 It more than doubles everything He's earned in his career so far I mean it's truly ridiculous But I suppose there's also something to be said about The length and intensity of the season That we had lots of top seas dropping out And we even got to this point Well certainly when Carlos Alcarrath And Yannick Sinner aren't there The rest of the world need to take advantage As we've seen throughout this season Carlos Alcarrath didn't play because of injury Yannick Sinner had to retire And he was cramped in his second match But there were still a lot of seriously good players In the draw Novak Djokovic, Holger Roonor I've mentioned two of those Alex Veraff, Taylor Fritz, all the best players Yes tired at the end of the season But what an incredible achievement for this guy Outside the world's top 200 Now 40 in the world by the way To take advantage and win the title Yeah absolute scenes as well Very emotional go and have a look on social media You can read more about it on the BBC Sport website as well Russell thank you so much Chris Sutton now 606 is going to follow Second half commentary here at Hamden, Scotland Leading Belarus by a goal to Nilsa Chris You'll want to be talking about this But plenty else going on in Scotland as well Well there is First of all I want to talk about The Scotland game 45 minutes huge 45 minutes for Steve Clark Can he be the Scotland manager To take you back to your first world cup Since I think 98 Katie, but yeah Steven Gerrard Withdrawing from the Rangers managerial Process Want to hear from Rangers fans Why do you think he withdrew and who do you want Next Azure manager Rangers fans Want to hear from England fans About Thomas Tuchel's Comments Do you have trust in Thomas Tuchel And his theory it's more about the team Than individuals of course he left out Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden Jack Grealish and Cole Palmer From this last squad Is he going to be a manager Who's going to stick with that Theory or he's going to take Bellingham To the world cup as Leigh Foden Surely he's just bluffing Want to hear from England fans On Thomas Tuchel And where England are heading under him Lovely stuff Chris Sutton is going to be alongside Aaron Paul Following second half commentary At Hamden Park so get your calls in now You can talk about anything All and above what we were talking about there WSL has been going on today as well In 2009 at 6.93 Thomas Tuchel as well Ali and Pat saying that Wembley wasn't Loud enough a couple of days ago When England were in action against Wales What the volume levels like at Hamden Park Well they're a lot better after that Che, Adam's go in the first half But the tunes have been pumping at Apptime we've had all the usuals The proclaimers, yes they're I can boogie Pat and Evan was enjoying some of that As were the fans inside here But the players are back out onto the field No changes for either side Had Scotland looked to try And put this game beyond Belarus And then they can sit and wait And see what happens this evening Because of Denmark beat Greece It will guarantee that playoff play For Scotland as they aim to get back To a World Cup like Chris says for the first time Since 1998 And they get us back under way Scotland in their navy blue With yellow trim playing From right to left Belarus And their pale green shirts Shorts and socks playing For left to right And what do you think Pat and Evan The message would have been At half time from Steve Park I actually think he wants to weave a bit more A little bit more urgency A little bit more tiredness coming into the Belarusian side Certainly Scotland came to play with more intensity Than they have so far But not to be stupid about it And not to leave gaps in the back Well Gromiko instantly trying to weave his way A little bit more but the Scotland pair do well to thwart him As he looks to try and get a shot away And now Scotland are able to go into attack Good work from McGinn under pressure To Miktomini his pass to Robertson Just deflected out But Robertson will pick the ball up for the throw in Inside Belarus half And John McGinn scrapping away Wins the ball and tries to play it forward For Che Adams who's in behind He is going to get in the end of this His cross though, is blocked by Martinovic Miktomini wins it back now Edge of the penalty area left hand side McGinn To Kenny McLean He's encouraged to shoot which he does Left-footed but it is Harmfully wide Of Lepoukov's left hand post But a good start from Scotland Well you asked the question what was Steve McLean Who said a bit more intensity Last better than the start from the start of the first half Getting close putting a few tackles in Putting a few tackles in high up the field If you end up the Belarusian players play from the back He looked good if he gave them time Don't look so different you close them down As we are right now Belarus launching it forward But that will be cleared up easily by Jack Henry I'll just run you through the Scotland team Angus Gunn in goal a back four Of Andy Robertson, Scott McKenna, Jack Henry And Anthony Ralston A midfield of Billy Gilmore, Kenny McLean Scott McTomini with John McGinn Playing more on the left hand side Ben Ganondoc on the right Che Adams the goal scorer up front Scott McTomini from just outside the penalty area And it stings the pimes of LePaukov He's just able to stun it into a stop In front of him and pick up the afters And Scotland are beginning To up the ante in this second half Well we're right in front here Steve Look how further up the field Scotland are When the Belarusian goalkeeper has got the ball Beforehand, Scotland were allowing The Belarusians to play it out from the back With no real pressure at all There was no press at all The second half at the start of the second half That's not the case Long ball from Kenny McLean Crossfield looking for the run-off Ganondoc but Zabalin does well to head it out It will be a Scotland throw-in though level With Belarus's penalty area Which Anthony Ralston comes forward To take And Ganondoc in that first half Gave Zabalin nightmares The Belarus defender Getting past them at every opportunity And now coming forward is McTomini Ganondoc on the ball Support from McLean Ganondoc gets it back Scotland with bodies forward In and around that penalty area But the little pass through Looking for the run-off from Billy Gilmore Is deflected and Ralston takes the throw-in quickly Gilmore gets in behind, cuts it back And there is Parker Menko To just put it behind for the first Scotland corner of the second half And the hand in part crowd Are responding to a positive start From Scotland Ultra-positive, exactly Steve McLean must have said quite a lot of hard words In there because at different level You're real energy about the play You're a good imagination too Again, putting it right on top of the goalkeeper Who Strops it at the first attempt But picks it up with the second And then just launches it forward to Gromyko He's up there almost on his own And it's good ball Winning from It's from Scotland Henry, wasn't it? We were talking before the game, weren't we? About the centre-backs Scotland have changed both centre-backs And you're wondering why? I think you can see why now Henry McKenna are likely They're very, very quick It's all about that in this game How you going to be caught in the break And it's spot on each time they look at the break Their pace has got them out of it In that time it was McKenna Jack Henry and Scott McKenna in this game But we do have a goal in the WSL In the game between Liverpool and Manchester City Charlie Sleaso And it's a Manchester City equaliser Bonnie Shaw with a shot from just inside of the penalty area It's pushed away by the goalkeeper And needlessly, I think It was probably going to go behind But the keeper then pushes it into the path of Imam Benny She scored the winner against Arsenal last weekend She's got an equaliser in Anfield this afternoon 65-goal, one-up piece And it's a wonderful signing Imam Benny has been from Manchester City A really exciting young talent The Swiss international As Belarus win a free kick Just in the midfield area The lively Maleshivic Just going down under pressure He was constantly Running around in that first half Causing problems and Really their main threat, Belarus I would agree with that Grimiko's got something about him as well It's quieting down again The fans are desperate to get going And they will get going as soon as Scotland shows them something But it's always been Scotland who has the ball It just goes Very, very quiet Robertson winning The header And it finds McGinn, who finds Adams Who tries to play it out to Ganondog who had space on that right-hand side But there was a poor pass Really from the Scotland striker And now Belarus come forward Smalls the minute of figure But good with the ball At his feet and he lays it off to passion And that cross is cleared by Henry But they will go back to Passioning on that left-hand side And again Grimiko trying to just find a way Past Scott McDominay, McDominay does well And Grimiko takes down The Scotland midfield out Free kick to Scotland on the right edge Of Angus Gunn's penalty area One of the good things about Scotland They've only lost one goal I think, lost one goal in this group so far From memory And you know that's imperative If you're going to get qualifications You're tight at the back You watch the Belarusians get into a very good position there But the number of Scots players that were back in there The way they tackled and there's Tigerish they're tackling there McDominay got the ball back And Scotland can relax again Yes, goal lists for Scotland in their opening Qualifying match against Denmark Two-nil victory against Belarus in Hungary Belarus played the ball over the top Looking for Milasevic but Robertson's there And then that three-one win Against Greece on Thursday night Poor from Angus Gunn though He passes the ball straight to Barkowski, the cross in Though headed clear by Ralston That was a dangerous moment and Angus Gunn He's not had a lot to do this evening At all but that was a poor clearance From the now Nottingham Forest Goalkeeper as Ganondoc just shuffles Passed a couple of Belarus players Which gets a cheer from the hand-in-part crowd And Scotland now moved the ball Right to left, Robertson into McGinn, controls it well, played it back For the run of Robertson but that's not one of Robertson's Best it will fall though And be kept in at the far post by Ganondoc Nobody there, cleared To Gilmore, shoot, say to Scotland crowd Shoot he does, not known for his Goal scoring is Billy Gilmore That one goes, harmfully over the top Off the crossbar It was a good sweeping move from Scotland Down the left hand side And not giving any ball up there You thought it was maybe lost But Ganondoc goes to the byline there Keeps the ball in play, pulls it back But you can expect that more In this game now, when Belarusia Have to come out more and more He's going to leave gaps Ganondoc is fitting off to last the rest Of the game, there will be more space For him to run into Billy Gilmore actually scored his first Couple of weeks ago for Napoli against Pisa He has two in a Scotland shot That's one thing that people do say About Billy Gilmore and it's right You know, limitations of The amount of goals actually created And actually scored, every other part of the game Is brilliant as a Holding, not creative But controlling midfielder Ganondoc coming forward, he's got McGinn, McGinn could have let that go for Robertson He takes it himself, shot is saved Pushed wide by Lyapukov Well played from John McGinn I think Robertson was calling for it McGinn backed himself though in Belarus Now looking to go on attack But Robertson back quickly does well Finds McGinn He shrugs off the challenge of P-Gas And now he's got space To look for a Scotland Team-mate which he does with Gilmore Just on the half-way line, Billy Gilmore goes back To his captain Andy Robertson Making his 88th appearance Tonight in a Scotland Jersey He's got an incredible record For Scotland, he's played the last 20 games before this evening So 21 games in a row for Scotland He's an ever present, incredible Fitness levels when you consider as well How many games he has played over the last Period of time at Liverpool On a number of different fronts And of course remember, he's not just He's flying up there, he's been a left winger He's getting into positions to get crosses And you know, I have to say Kirk is a lucky boy Getting the game most weeks in front of him At the moment Nice, started a few games Robertson, Kirk is certainly number one Choice here he is again Scotland captain finds McGinn just Outside the penalty area McGinn Perhaps looking for the overlap of Robertson But he chose him to keep his position So he's worked it now deeper And now on the right hand side in Ganondoc Again, it's that delivery pat that just has Let him down again, it's gone out of play For a goal kick, but It's a part of the game, he's a 19 year old player Who's not played a huge amount of football This season and had a difficult Time last season with a hamstring injury That kept him out for three months So perhaps understandable pat Is a little bit of rustiness there There is, but you know He's a top professional footballer He'll be seriously disappointed He's finally got a few occasions tonight And that one was really quite poor Again, he's done everything right He's got into the right position He's got a little bit of space There's no bubbles out there But he's gone 20 yards over the crossbar But then again, keep on doing that You'll drive your opposition back Further and further and further I'm just saying there's a wee bit of a change there That change that I suggested they make With Ganondoc, well talk about that at the moment Yeah, because Melnichenko has come on the field For Belariz and he's now coming forward His first involvement across Which Angus Gunn is able to pick out And hold, but Melnichenko has come on That plays his football in Portugal For total B He has come on and replaced P-Gas But Melnichenko is a striker He's a forward player, so At least shuffle for Belariz They've put Petchen and I think back to left-back Who's a more natural looking left-fullback And it's quite stuns me That it's taken the manager so long To realise which would Blatantly obvious during the start Of the game Now the goalkeeper has come out To take that loose ball on his chest Outside his area and Scotland are desperately trying to win back Possession, but Belariz have worked it well And now they come forward Throw Ibibong onto that left-hand side Into the penalty area A couple of step-overs shot away And Angus Gunn stops it going out For a corner after it was deflected By Jack Henry, does well The goalkeeper But again that's the influence of the Substitute Melnichenko on that left-hand side He's looked lively in the Minute or so he's been on pat Yeah he has I think immediately The Belarizans look at a better balance squad Scotland haven't got an easy out in the right-hand side Now Good decision to make the change Bad decision to make To leave it this long if you're a Belariz fan 57 minutes on the clock Scotland still leading by that goal to Nill And it's been a positive start to the second half From Scotland, they've certainly Played the game a lot further up the field A lot more in Belariz's defence of third As they search For that second goal That would undoubtedly seal This game, Belariz have scored just once In this qualifying campaign It was from the penalty spot As Che Adam clicks to try and get on the end of that Loose ball, he's up Again, Parkimenko He's pulled him down in the area There was a real tussle And Adams and Parkimenko Were tussling for the ball Parkimenko goes down, he then pulls Che Adams And the referee has not made a decision here He's perhaps waiting to see what the decision May well be from the VAR officials Because that looked like Che Adams had a case for a penalty kick Well first of all, the defender tried to grab the ball And missed it When he goes down, he puts his hands out To grab the ball I think he touches the ball with his hand out And then he puts his arms around Che Adams Where Che Adams is actually down By that point, but it has to be clear and obvious I think they'll be looking at the possible handball first He does reach out his arm when Che Adams gets past Parkimenko Parkimenko does put his arm out To try and move the ball He doesn't make contact with the ball We now have the potential penalty check Up on our screens here at Hamden Park But he got himself in an absolute mess there Yego Parkimenko and Che Adams He is strong He has got pace But he didn't even need to use that much of his physicality To get past Parkimenko, he just Made a real mess of it He's got a low centre of gravity, Che Adams And that's really hard for some tall centre-halves to deal with So let's take hold of this one Remember, it has to be a clear And obvious mistake by the referee So if he's missed a handball It's clear and obvious However, I think he's going to Talk to Andrew Roberts I wonder if it was the ball touching his hand Or was it kicked onto his hand From just a couple inches away And that's what they're trying to figure out just now It's one of those classic Millimetres one I would actually just like them to say to the referee Go on over and have a wheeler, make a decision Andrew Roberts is now looking at the bench And asking the question of a handball Touching his fingers to his left hand Was it a handball because the Scotland Bench will have a monitor in there I'll tell you something else about it There was a head on the ground Where the defender's head Hit Che Adams with the back of his leg And brought him down You don't get many penalties for that do you? No, but Che Adams had no reason to Go down, he beaten the defender He was one of one of the goalkeeper And now the referee is being asked to go over And take a look at the VAR monitor I've done that a minute ago when I said yes He certainly didn't make any Any decision when the ball was in play It went out for a throw in And he left it And it has now been asked to go over And take a look at the monitor So a big moment for Scotland This is the referee Takes a look back Che Adams potentially Has won the penalty But there is certainly That's a handball Certainly a hand goes out And touches the ball Which takes it off the path That it was on and Che Adams isn't able To get a clean touch That was my first thought He's going to try to grab the ball What are you doing that for? You're in the penalty area, you're on the ground fair enough But you know, they've looked at that And they're going to look at that Actually they've looked at that But did Che Adams use his hand? Well this is an interesting development And if Marco Menko goes to ground It does look like Che Adams As they tussle for that ball That it may have touched Adams' hand as well He's now calling over the referee The Belarus captain, Alexander Martinovich And he's going to have a word with the both captains here And explain What has gone because this will take a bit of explanation Pat, because that handball By Che Adams in the build up Was certainly not something That either of us were looking at It's not a penalty, it's very great It's not going to please this crowd And what just pleases the crowd more Is that it's a Belarus free kick And nobody in this stadium will know why And that's the nonsense of VAR You should really put that up Make an announcement, whatever All the fans in it, it's one of the biggest mistakes When VAR was brought in That you've got all these people here who Have no concept or understanding of why it's happened And yet We have play on there and they're completely confused With good money to be here They're the first people that should be showing What has gone wrong or told So a handball by Che Adams in the build up To the handball that potentially was going to lead To a penalty, no penalty given Still Scotland lead by a Goltanel against Belarus With 62 minutes played here At Hamden Park as the ball is launched forward Looking for Ganon, don't But it is one and now E-Bong is able to just put his foot on it And play it back to Zabelin Who goes forward, a lovely little flick From the substitute Melna Chenko Now Mek Tominy goes down But to frustrate the Hamden crowd Further, no free kick given And Belarus come forward, edge of the area Across the line, and there's Maleshevich And it's an equaliser And Belarus have stunned Hamden Park If Jenny Maleshevich Scores his first ever International goal The goalkeeper has run The full length of the field To celebrate with his team-mates Who thought just the moment To go, that Scotland were going To have a penalty to move to ahead And now Belarus have found A way to make things equal My goodness, Scotland do not do it The easy way, Scotland won Belarus won It was a good break, but you've got to admit The fans are here, they're annoyed With two things, one thing was A few moments ago, and the same thing Is Scotland coming in not getting a free kick In the build-up, he got himself in front there The referee said no, he thinks this is a good challenge Scott McTominay is furious about that Because he's lost it, Scotland are out of position They go to the buy-in line And Andy Robertson, he's got his back He can't see The attacker coming behind him You don't turn your back in that situation We're going to have a look at the Inverted dramas Foul on Scott McTominay In the build-up there, but it's a tight one I don't think the referee's going to change that He'll have a good look at it, but I would be Surprised if he changes that one This looks like one-one, but we shall see Well, the referee is still Standing waiting as the goal check Comes up on the screen, a little bit Of an optimistic cheer From the Scotland supporters And the referee is asked to come across And look at the monitor once again A busy second half For the VAR officials And Marion Barboux, the Romanian referee Makes his way back over to the screen And this could be yet another turning point I did, but my attention's grown here I mean, the Scotland fans feel as if they've been Hard done to, but in the end I'm guessing it's the pre-kick On McTominay We tell you he doesn't play the ball, does he Pat? We're looking at it now, and McTominay Moves the ball away from the challenge There's a shoulder to shoulder, but there's a knee On the knee, and doesn't play the ball I think this is where the fill is The knee on the knee And you look at it No, he doesn't play the ball I haven't seen a second down, I think Scotland made me just about to get away with this Are they? Here comes the signal, no goal Huge cheer around And no goal And Maleshavic's Celebrations are cut short A free kick to Scotland, it remains Scotland won Belarus Mil In the midst of all this round Scotland fans are more than the referee He's nailed it both times OK, he's not made the decisions They'll go and have a look at it He'll figure it all out VAR was brought in for a reason And we've just seen two of the correct reasons why Two correct decisions And it means that the scoreline remains As it was at the start of the second half Scotland with that vital lead They will want to make that more comfortable They've been given a real warning By this Belarus team They are dangerous on the attack They can create opportunities They'll need to try and get that second goal To make it comfortable Because a Scotland victory tonight Coupled with a Denmark victory Later on this evening against Greece Will guarantee a playoff place For Scotland And that is what they're looking for A challenge slides in, Maleshavic Frustrated not to get that goal Slides in on Scott McKenna And gives away a free kick So two hugely pivotal moments Decided by VAR And I think we've got them both right The referee and the VAR Had a good look at it That's what it's brought in for You don't want major games and even Qualification for competitions made On bad decisions Those two are for me good decisions But tight, good decisions but tight But the one thing it has done is told Scotland You can't relax now, this game isn't over And it's certainly since the The change that the Belarusians have made They've taken away, the change at left back Such a defence Adams does well, wide to challenge Tries to cut it in to Billy Gilmore has gone down in the area Referee says no penalty Cheers from the hand in crowd They want a spot kick Lovely ball winning from Chee Adams But Gilmore looks to stumble in the area As he's trying to control that ball Will be a throw in for Scotland on that far side Gilmore pleading his case To the official who does have his hand up Onward he says, come on play on Scotland won, Belarus nil No penalty kick for that, absolutely no chance Not even at hand on top Lovely feet from Gannondoke, tries to get the cross He goes down, it is deflected It will be a corner kick Not a free kick over on that far side It was actually Anthony Rallston with the lovely feet To get the cross in The yellow card comes up Goes the way Of Kirill Peschenin That's bigger news than You would think Yellow card for a full back So what, that happens Peschenin now cannot dive in Gannondoke, if you're away You'll be flying already You're thinking, party time, give me the ball He's not happy Peschenin grumbling away As he makes his way into the Six yard box, Scotland with the Corner kick from that far side John McGinn will again Swing it in to Wards the goalkeeper Looks like Keir and Tierney might be about to make an appearance But let's get this corner kick under First, in it comes, right on top of That goalkeeper who's punched it yet again But Moleshevic is there To get it clear, stop though by Andy Robertson Who's got Gilmore for support Gilmore tries to play it back into the path of Robertson A little bit too much On it, and it goes all the way through to the goalkeeper John Sooter also down below us Stripped and ready to come on A couple of defensive changes Coming Scotland's way, Pat Nevin I just wonder, you say that I think you might be a system change But we'll talk about that in a moment Scott McTominay has been played in behind by Chee Adams Onto the byline, looking for the return to Adams Deflected another corner kick from that far side And Scotland once again Beginning to play the game In the right areas and cause Belarus problems The big thing to watch out for when Scotland do eventually make these changes Is if the number three Comes up Now number three might not come up Scotland might go to a back five here That's a real possibility for Scotland You're one now up, you've got a certain amount of time to survive And by the way, Scotland not bad with a back five Because the left hand side with Tierney And Robertson together So it'll get raised eyebrows if it happens I don't think it'll be silly We have also seen Tierney come on In a more left midfield position Ahead of Robertson as that corner comes in Again punched, and this time He's not there again, but good challenge from McGinney, he's now played it back onto that Right side where Robertson then finds Gannon, don't cross and there's Chee Adams But the flag is up The flag is up and we'll deny Chee Adams A second goal tonight It's come off his left arm Seen that a mile away Probably ought to get booked for that to be fair Actually scrapped me probably He should be booked for that He's definitely, I mean I've not for a millisecond that I think that was a goal I mean he's zipped And he's shouting at every, saying It wasn't my hand, it came off my shoulder Oh, he's chrissed it He's chrissed it It comes off his left shoulder VAR checking this goal The cross comes in from Gannon Dope and Chee Adams gets ahead It does look from the naked eye Like it comes off his arm, but on the replay It certainly looks to maybe come off Above the shirtline I've not seen a good enough angle here Wow, VAR's got his walk cut out tonight It's one of those ones where the first time He's thinking, his arm's out He put that in with his hand actually He didn't celebrate it though, did he? He turned around as if he was re-bitten embarrassed by it You know, so I thought well that's I often look for the reaction of the players So I thought, he knows what he's done there But they've not shown us On our monitors here at Handon Park If there's a better angle The two angles we've got They're not good enough They're not good enough to tell you if that was chess But these are extraordinary moves In Scotland's qualification This could be The most important moment Of the entirety of it And I know we're not playing just now I know the game's not going on But this is it A huge moment And they're going to make the substitutes At the moment, as this check I think it's still ongoing So Kieran Tiena is coming on and he He will replace Anthony Ralston And John Susser will come on for Jack Henry The check is over, the goal will not stand So let's head to Anfield where there's been another goal Between Liverpool and Manchester City in the WSL Charlie Slater And Manchester City have turned it around In the 86th minute Alba Fugino down the right side of the penalty area Hits it hard and low And through the Liverpool goalkeepers' legs Liverpool 1 Manchester City 2 So play on here, Scotland 1 Belarus 0 We have had all sorts of VAR drama But after 72 minutes That is still the scoreline As Kieran Tiena comes on and makes his way over Into the right back position John Susser, like for like with Henry And instantly Tiena is forced to try And win a header Which he does and it is the substitute Melnichenko who gets his head on it And he's able to just clutch that Goalbound attempt from Melnichenko And are you Perplexed in any way Pat with Tierney going over to that right back position No, because Melnichenko is like Goodson Come on hasn't he Tierney, you're not saying to him, go on And fly forward as a, you know, overlapping Fullback all the time, you're saying, stop him And Kieran Tierney is not bad at that usually So I understand Stevie Clarke wants a little bit of experience Over there, Ralston doesn't always play All the time And Hickey being probably the first choice there But he's saying to Tierney Just stop that winger, that's your job If you can get the ball up to Ben Gannon Don't be front of you, that's good too Scotland win a free kick, there are other options At right back, Max Johnson Who is it when it comes to experience Certainly not experienced in an international Jersey at all, just the four Caps, 21 years old So Kieran Tierney is preferred to The more natural right back Max Johnson and takes his place on that right Handside as Scotland take the free Kick, play it back to Angus Gun And Gilmore Now to McKenna, that is deflected Out for a Scotland throw in, so As we heard from Charlie Slater, Man City leading against Liverpool Aston Villa Where it's goalless against Leicester City In the WSL earlier today, Chelsea with a 1-0 Win over Tottenham, it finished Everton One man united four, London City The WSL is one-0 victory over West Ham And Arsenal By the same scoreline, a 1-0 win over Brighton You can see all the highlights this evening On the women's football show On BBC One at 11 30 I can do one other thing that Stevie Clark Got in the mind here, you have to think In lateral ways When you're a manager team If Scotland do lose a goal from here on in You can actually then move Tierney Over to the other side, bring someone else on And then you can go to a back five When you've got our left hand side And you've got Robinson Tierney together Who are phenomenal together So yeah, he's done it this way just now But it can be adapted because you've got Tierney on the pitch Well Scotland looking to try And get the ball into some dangerous areas again McGinn back to Gilmorey He's got McTominay alongside him, finds him McTominay put under pressure quickly, loses the ball But McKenna is there to fire it Forward looking for Ganon Dooku Challenges for the header alongside Peshinon but I don't think he's going to win it against The Belarus forward It's like Gromyko tries to just head it past McKenna and get on the end of his flick McKenna really strong though holds him off Do you know that's great defending That is brilliant defending He's second favourite there, he's missed the run of the ball So what he's thought is Okay, I'll put my body away and let the forward run into me So clever It looks simple, that's clever He is a strong defender As Belarus won a free kick right on the half Wayline, Scott McKenna now playing his Football for Denim Ozagreb He's played every single minute Of the league and Europa League For them this season So certainly up to Mark Match sharpness Scott McKenna It's not often I say but It's been really draggy a wee bit now You know before Handel is enjoying the game It's not this, it's a terrible game It's more of the fact that 15 minutes got half to now survive To the end of the game to get these three points And they feel like a long 15 minutes now 15 minutes to go We're into the 75th minute here And Scotland, you talk about them surviving Pat, but I think the supporters in here Would like to see them perhaps Make it comfortable Doesn't look like that just now, does it? No, and he does have options on the bench Does he go to them? Lyndon Dykes who scored Very, very late on against Greece To just absolutely ensure That victory he is available on the bench Gromyko cuts it in Lovely little layoff to Mileshavich Who's thwarted though and now McGinn Tries to skip past the challenge Of Ebon, does well Ebon takes aim and fires it Off the back of Andy Roberts and it spins out It will be a Belarus corner And now we're beginning to hear what the Handel Park crowd think of the way things are going The Scotland team, they're rocking a little bit They're running around the ropes at the moment a little bit What Scotland don't need is actually booing I know the fans have every right to do what they need The players down there need a little bit of help Just now, they need the fans behind them right now Now, Scotland looks for a goal The fans will get behind them Better do it now, much better do it now Because Scotland really are looking a lot But, weird They have been through the ringer a little bit The Scotland fans with all these VAR decisions, VAR checks And they're not able To see the monitors, they're not able to understand Why the Scotland didn't get a penalty As that corner comes in But Andy Robertson will clear it So the fans don't know why there wasn't a penalty awarded There was a handball by Chair Adams in the build-up That is why that didn't count And they felt aggrieved by that And they shouldn't be But I also think that Scotland haven't really created much It started the second half well But it's faded a little bit It's a tactical change That has been made by the opposition They've put special in at left full back now Since he's went there Ben Gannon don't have a hard way to kick He's not getting the spaces there And that's why you don't play a big old centre back At left back You play a normal left back at left back Belarus with the ball in the centre midfield Gromyko just allowed time To try and pick his pass He did have an option with Parkomenko Galloping down the right hand side They've kept the ball though It's now on this left hand side The substitute Melchenko Going forward He goes down under a challenge from John Souter But there was certainly no hint of a penalty there Just a poor touch from Melchenko As he went forward He allowed Souter to get back in But again Belarus are asking questions Now Scotland come forward And now the Hamden Park crowd begin to try and roar them on As McTominay loses out Goes down There was a free kick there And Belarus allowed to play on As Gromyko again coming forward He's been very lively in this second half He just plays it forward to Melchenko He's on the left edge of the penalty area He's got Souter for company Drops it back though Gets it back again Melchenko And now he plays it to Ebon He drops it back into midfield Gromyko gets it and plays it in a lovely little pass To Barkovsky But the shot is poor The Hamden Park crowd do not want to see it though They're frightened They're edged, they're worried Under right to be at the moment It just needs a little deflection In that sort of position Now Scotland are defending quite solidly just now But Scotland are rarely now Getting into the final third You would want them to be controlling the game at this point Stevie Clarke must be seriously tempted To make even more changes in the majors now Because at the moment Scotland are second best There doesn't seem to be any movement down there On the Scotland bench But they are chatting Yeah, Naismith and Clarke are talking They know there's something wrong When they talk like that, getting together They're wondering what do we change Is it a bit tiredness? Is it somebody holding the ball up front Because Dix is the obvious one It's a bit over obvious Because he's going off against two big centre backs He may not get much of the ball either Che Adams is certainly Putting a shift this evening Two sides Che Adams But Scotland have lacked A little bit in terms of cutting edge This evening And this is a Belarus side That shipped six to Denmark On Thursday night, which probably didn't help Scotland's cause in terms of the expectations Of supporters coming here this evening It is goal difference, incidentally That will decide If the two teams are locked On the same points come the end of this campaign So Denmark certainly winning that one Scotland will need, you think Have to finish above Denmark on points If they are To win this group You just can't get too far ahead of yourself We all do it We can't help it, that's a football But the fans will be thinking that We'll be thinking that and yeah, may come down to that You've got to get three points You've got to get these three points That's all that matters at the moment Nothing else matters, whatever everything else there If Scotland get three points here There'll be a game against Denmark But Scotland will have to win To go through, I'll take that And I think Siri Clark would too But there is a potential Penalty check happening at the moment I think that might be a problem with the signage Because the ball wasn't anywhere near the penalty area It was a free kick for Scotland on the left But now again, a space ahead of him Just outside the penalty area He's got Robertson, Robertson putting it towards the back post Where Gannondoke is, he tries to get it under control Under pressure from Peschen Does well Gannondoke in the corner But it has gone out of play And it will be a goal kick And Ben Gannondoke is berating the linesman On that far side, but I think it did trickle out of play And that is the problem A little bit for Andy Robertson With those deep balls in Gannondoke's not a player who's going to Have that aerial threat at the back post You want to put that in there, there's a good ball In a decent area there, but we draw on McTormney Who's coming in there, and McGinnom who's coming in there And it's not been the case that's been go A strong challenge from Tierney He gets a roar of appreciation But then Tierney is taken out He's down in a heap, the referee is way play on But he now stops it and it will be a yellow card I think it's Max Ebon that took down Keir and Tierney on that far side Yeah, who do you hate? Every Scottish person knows when Tierney goes down You miss a beat, don't you? You hold your breath because There's so many unfortunate injuries in his career He's taken a wee bit of time to get up And good news He's going to carry on He's got that left wrist heavily strapped Still the Celtic fullback Because the game continues But Scotland again, McTormney going down But again, losing the ball He's losing the ball a lot, Scotland McTormney And it almost led to disaster For Scotland before that At this point in time, Scott, just hold it Play the simple ball, make sure you're not caught In possession, and certainly don't lose the ball Go to ground And where the opposition is And where the opposition is They push on That is a poor goal kick As Belarus make another couple of changes Whilst they do that, let's get the full-time Scoreline from Anfield with Charlie Slater It's finished, Liverpool won Man City 2 But Liverpool thought they'd snatched a point With the final kick of the game Only for the offside flag to go up against Gemma Bonner, second half come back from City Rob Liverpool to that first precious WSL point It'll sting Gareth Taylor, of course Because of his history at Man City Liverpool led through Capox But goals from Bene and Fugino See City return to second While Liverpool remain pointless It's finished, Liverpool won Man City 2 Well, those changes for Belarus Have you made, Leib Kluczkow coming on For Mileshovich, who's been very lively And Korzon as well has come on As Robertson plays it in from the byline Headed clear though, but only as far As Kenny McLean, and it's a lovely spin From McGinn to just drive forward He gets the break of the ball on the byline Looking for options, he cuts it on To his right foot, goes deep there Scott McTominay, he's got a wall of Light blue shirts, and like green shirts ahead of him Works back out to Robertson, this time The ball goes in, there's McTominay That is the Hampton Roar That's Scotland have been waiting for Scott McTominay He just controls it Left footed shot, squeezes in At the far post And Scotland have their cushion They have their two goal advantage It is that man, Scott McTominay With his 13th goal In a Scotland shirt To make it Scotland 2 Belarus Mil There's some sound you hear In a football stadium When you hear a roar And also a sigh of relief Exactly the same sigh That's what has gone from Scotland there They chased the ball down well Winning the second balls twice They're there, but the technique's Superb McTominay He hasn't had any greats the game so far We've got him positioned quite a few times McGinn holds it up really well But he won't give up, they're winning it In the box there, but when it comes into McTominay, the first touch Gorgeous, with his chest Gets it down, very similar to Shia Adams, half ball into the corner Belarus looking to answer back Straight away and John Souter Flew himself at that cross He headed it beyond Angus Gunn's goal for a corner for Belarus, so an instant response from the visitors, but Scott McTominay He didn't have long, the ball from Robertson just skipped past the Belarus player, he had to react so quickly To just cushion that down with his chest And then take that left-footed Shot into the bottom corner We're getting the replay of John Souter's Defensive clearance there That was quite spectacular I don't know if Angus Gunn was a little bit In the corner comes in to the substitute Melchenko, but his shot Is absolutely Canoned off the back of a Scotland shirt, but they work it again From this left-hand side and it goes again Souter's up to try and deny The Belarus captain It's fired around and now it's gone beyond The back, beyond the goal And in for a Scotland goal kick Do you know what's nice, Hayley You mentioned really well in the game Belarus aren't that bad Defenders OK, apart from The left, set back at left-back They've held the ball well A little bit of quality final thought It's the difference often between the Very good sides, and in this case McTominay, how often has he Done it, not only for Scotland But for Napoli as well It's been absolutely phenomenal how good he is technically And it's always a one-toucher, a two-touch Finish with McTominay That one was round, oh, goalkeeper The goalkeeper has come out to a long ball To Che Adams, he's done well, the goalkeeper But Adams is saying, play it quickly Now Gilmore with a chance to shoot from long range The goalkeeper posted missing, but he Just can't keep it down under the crossbar Oh, what a chance that was Great play there, Randy Robertson Just wants to clip it over the goalkeeper's head He does so, but gives it a little bit too much How Billy Gilmore would have loved that Would that be the second Scotland goal? Third Scotland goal But it's looking Finally, nearly in the 87, hit the 87 minute In the clock And as I say that, there's a break There is a break and there is space For Kuchko, the substitutes Got a player outside him But it's fired across the face of Goal by Melnichenko, that was a huge Opportunity for Belarus But I'm mentioning about the final Sub, and about the fact that the real quality You need right in front of the goal That absolutely should have been Goal for Belarus, but They made a mess of it at the end there Scotland get off it, could have been the last A few difficult minutes for Scotland there They got away with it, slightly Billy Gilmore's come off, he said A good and said of great Evening for Scotland Worked incredibly hard, held the ball well Fought well, could have had a goal With his last touch on the ball So well done, Billy Gilmore Another Good Scotland, experience under his belt And Scotland can bring in some fresh legs Which is really, really important at this point In time Yeah, Lenin Miller is replacing Billy Gilmore For his fourth cap Another one of the Scots Who've made their way to Italy, now playing with football At Udinese, he is on for Gilmore And Che Adams The goal scorer of the first goal He will also make way for Lyndon Dikes Who will hope to get another Late winner, or another late goal Scotland already have this Game one, Lyndon Dikes who scored Late against Greece, he also scored late For Birmingham against Blackburn And against Swansea this season So perhaps he can Put a little gloss on tonight's scoreline In these final few minutes I know it's only Two minutes plus injury time to go We can now talk about goal difference Because we've finally got those two goals And it may be a little bit too late To get that, but The two points are here now for Scotland And I can't say it's been comfortable It's not been comfortable for most of the game But you know, you just got to find a way to do it And Scotland have finally found a way To get that, to get that, to get that And Tierney plays it into McTominay I think he might be offside, but he continues to go forward Into the area, takes it onto his right foot Looking for an option, plays it back And looking there for Gannondale And now the flag does go up to deny Scotland advancing any further McTominay looked offside The minute the ball was played And Belarus might make a couple of changes Yeah, well you say it might have been offside You knew fine well, didn't you? Absolutely, it was miles offside there And you know That's the rules, you'll have to play it on Scotland actually won't mind It just ticks off a few more seconds The substitutions, that'll tick off a few more seconds as well And the problem you've got for the Belarus They don't know what they're doing just now They can't seem to Make a decision of who they're going to bring off They keep on changing their mind Yeah, it was originally the captain Martinovic that was held up And it is But it's not actually Martinovic that's gone off It is Parkomenko, the other centre half So he's replaced by Nikita Demchenko And also waiting to come on Is Sergei Karpovich Who's still waiting to come on Because they're having an issue with the board And getting the right numbers on it And Hamden Park is now being lit up By Torchman Being lit up by Torches all around the stand The night sky dark above us As the supporters Lift their torches and now we have a number Raised and it is Going to be Yablonsky, the midfielder Who is replaced by Karpovich And also about to come on for Scotland For just a second cap Is the head striker Kieran Bowie Is that substitution going to happen I think it is indeed and I hope it does Bowie is going to be important Going forward for Scotland And also It gives this man A little chance To get his moment And it's Ben Gannon Doke Listen To the applause at Hamden Park Ben Gannon Doke Might only be 19 years old He might only be winning his 10th cap Tonight but he is A fan favourite Amongst these Hamden supporters Eight minutes Added on here That board has gone up now Kieran Bowie makes his way onto the field 12 minutes against Lichtenstein And a friendly Is only appearance so far Bowie So he gets a competitive Debut In a Scotland shirt To know I mentioned The fact that you can think about goal difference now Scotland will get two centre forwards That's possibly This one, Stevie Clark's Mind at the moment You really wouldn't want that one in backflip Coming up after us Here on Radio 5 Live 6-0-6 with Aaron Paul and Chris Sutton You can get your questions in The lines are now open 0808-5 909-6-9-3 What did you make of Scotland's performance this evening Who should Steve Clark start In these crucial two games to come Against Greece and Denmark And potentially secure their place At a World Cup For the first time since 1998 If Belarus come forward That is deflected The shot from Ebon It's going to go wide and out for a corner kick Belarus they are still asking questions Obviously Scotland defence but this game has been One pat Nevan No I'm not going there Are you not feeling confident yet Yes confident But utterly completely totally comfortable Scotland has a goal now There's five minutes to go You don't relax at all I'm looking along the lines A bunch of X-posed along the line for us Not one of them smiling Cross comes in and this time Angus Gunn is able to clutch the header Out to the sky And hold on to it You'll take up all seven seconds here Good, we won't let me do that just now It's just something weird can happen We've seen weird things happening in games In Norwegians late in games But at the moment I would like that third goal now Bowie asking for the ball played over the top By McGinn he gets it but it's headed clear On the afar as Dykes and now into the area Scott McTomah near the arms Go up off Zabelin but it didn't come off His hand the Belarus defender Scotland keep it coming forward through McGinn on this right hand side to the byline Dinks it up there's the header and there's the opportunity From Bowie and it just doesn't drop For him he got a touch on it But he didn't get enough power on it The goalkeeper Laupovic is able to pick it up And play it forward once again Same for Bowie there It just came in a little bit too early From the wide wing area which he's playing in Of course he's naturally a centre forward He wants to be in there He scored some fabulous goals this season In particular in One of the European qualifiers For Hibs Against Partizan Was quite spectacular That cross is going to be plucked out by Tierney No nonsense from Tierney Just one chic clear up the pitch Again Tierney's come on and done the job They were looking very dangerous The Belarusians down that left hand side Tierney's come on and Tina killed it a little bit Which is really good play by him But good thinking by the manager E-Bong with the ball for Belarus Drops it back to Zabelin To his captain Martinovic Every player in Scotland's half now Belarusian goalkeeper As the ball is launched Into the area Nobody there though it will go all the way through But it is a Belarus player That picks it up And Tierney is just trying to put the pressure on But they keep possession And now pitching and launches it in back post And there was an opportunity there At the back post from Karpovic But he got his shot all wrong Sliced it behind for a goal kick But again Belarus He's got a chance to create the openings In these last extra 8 minutes There are two opportunities that can go They actually have to They've not been great opportunities But they've had and they've not made the best of them In fact they've been quite poor He puts the ball across the ball It's a back post He could have pushed that across There's a tough end there for the Belarusians And honestly Final touch Keeping yourself calm in the final What about the Belarusians that have been all right? Three minutes off the added 8 Left to play here at Hamden Park Scotland with that 2-0 lead Over Belarus It has been far from comfortable for Steve Clarke's side But it was all about the points It was all about the victory They have got that secured It looks like it will be another 2-0 victory Over Belarus The second time this scoreline has happened In this World Cup qualifying campaign But again it's Belarus who are going forward It was beautifully worked From Belarus And it's just spun round the post From Kuchko Great spin, gives himself a one-on-one With Angus Gunn and he just calmly Puts it in past the goalkeeper That's his first goal For Belarus in just his second Cap, Kled Kuchko And it perhaps made it a nervier couple of minutes Than Scotland would have wanted Scotland 2, Belarus 1 You know what I'm saying now, don't you? I've been here with Scotland before Games of football, if you put 8 minutes extra Much can happen in 8 minutes of football If I had 2 good chances And I've scored the goal Scotland have to get this right at the moment They have to kill it off Steve Clarke's went for an extra forward Had to be tempted to kill the game off And go 3 at the back They now come with Melanchenko down this left-hand side He's got Tierney for company He gets across him though but that's poor And it's well over the top of Angus Gunn's bar And that will be a Scotland goal kick But the supporters inside Hamden Park They're a little bit frustrated That this hasn't been as comfortable As they wanted to see it out When that second goal went in by Scott McTominay You felt that perhaps this would be A comfortable ending to the game You even mentioned goal difference at that point But it's been far from comfortable For Steve Clarke and his side I said we can think about goal difference Consider it, but you also have to get It's just about 2 points You need to make sure you win these games And don't do anything silly No slips at all Scotland's been in a position where You thought they'd given away a goal beforehand There was another slip there When they've given away a goal near the end And they've been opportunities Giving away quite a few of them Followed by the Russians and we haven't finished yet Scotland's sitting deep We're into the final minute of the added on 8 And it is Belarus who are on the ball Scotland 2, Belarus 1 Scotland needs to win Here tonight They have two huge games coming up against Greece and Denmark, but a victory here against Belarus would put them In a fantastic position at the top Of the group before Denmark and Greece Meet later on this evening And a win for Denmark in that game Would guarantee Scotland A playoff place at the very least But Belarus looking to try and get a second It's blocked and now there's an opportunity For Lenin Miller to strive forward He's not got a lot of support But McGinn is on the right-hand side He finds John McGinn now Belarus coming back in numbers John McGinn steps away from the challenge And now there are Scotland bodies forward He plays it across to Robertson Robertson, pure pass to Kieran Bowie And it's cleared though for a Scotland throw And inside Belarus' half that was tired From the Scotland captain It certainly was, but Scotland did the right thing there There was a moment where Lenin Miller Thought about shooting from the halfway line And he goes on, do you know what? He intelligently didn't Because if you lose position there They can be break on you Held the ball, Scotland have run it down And we're now over that 8-minute map Throw in from Robertson Bowie not able to get on the end of it Now Belarus launching it Clear and again Melnichenko on that left-hand side Who has been a real burden Since he came on as a substitute Has space John McGinn holds them up for a short period of time But it is with the captain now Martin Ovec as Belarus Come forward down this right-hand side Now and it's Demchenko on the ball He's got options in the area Dinks it in, but Tominy gets there first And is able to clear it, but it's only gone as far As a Belarus body and we're beyond the 8-minute And there is the full-time whistle It wasn't vintage It wasn't Swashbuckling football But it is the three points that Scotland needed It is the three points that takes them closer To a potential place At the World Cup Steve Clark Now moves level with Craig Brown For the most victories by a Scotland manager Goals from Che Adams and Scott McTominy Set them on their way, but Belarus would not go away And Kuchko got a late go back To make it a tense and nervy finish But it is a victory that puts Scotland Top of the group As things stand And it is a victory Pat Nevin That was the most important thing this evening I've went on about it quite a lot at the time And I know it sounds sometimes a wee bit like Cassandra when I'm talking about those sort of things This is the reason why It's because international football is tough There's nothing to lose for the Belarusians When you go two down and down So they're going to have a dig at Scotland They created chances There were a few boos at the end of this game It was 2-1 against a team that Scotland would expect And hope to beat by a good distance So there's a lot of upset around here Let's get it real 10 points from 12 Scotland gets two games left Every opportunity in Scotland are going to get The likelihood that Scotland are going to get At least second place just now And we might even have it Later on this evening No, it wasn't a brilliant performance There's nothing at any point in time I can say In this game it was a brilliant performance I wonder, anywhere near the top 10-20 Performance is for Scotland However, it's the points, as you say We've got the goals And a little bit of quality You need, in the penalty box We had them Scotland remain unbeaten Three wins from four At the start of this World Cup qualifying campaign They have put themselves in a position That every Scotland supporter Would have dreamt of being in At this stage of the qualifying campaign And they have done it with a 2-0 victory Here tonight at Hamden Park A massive couple of games To come down the line for Steve Clarke's side But they have got the job done And that is what was required of them It's finished at Hamden Park Scotland 2, Belarus 1",
