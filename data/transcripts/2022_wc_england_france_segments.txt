[0.00 - 4.00] P:1950.38 E:0.053903 |  ...Rabbiol, Dembele, Griezmann and Bappé in Giroux.
[4.00 - 6.88] P:1958.94 E:0.108534 |  The referee is from Brazil, Wilton Sampao.
[6.88 - 10.84] P:1952.04 E:0.098605 |  He blows his whistle and this World Cup quarter-final
[10.84 - 15.12] P:1856.32 E:0.092766 |  between England and France is underway, with the French kicking off.
[15.12 - 19.48] P:1703.47 E:0.101265 |  And Harry Maguire receives the ball on the edge of the box
[19.48 - 22.72] P:1742.70 E:0.093378 |  and just sweeps the ball out of play on the far side.
[22.72 - 24.96] P:1860.79 E:0.101595 |  It's flat. The ball's flat.
[24.96 - 26.56] P:1735.58 E:0.100443 |  The quarter-final of the World Cup
[26.56 - 29.68] P:1850.49 E:0.093293 |  when it starts as it goes with a flat ball.
[29.68 - 32.56] P:1861.86 E:0.099800 |  Well, that is extraordinary, isn't it?
[32.56 - 34.56] P:1809.84 E:0.095998 |  Talk about attention to detail.
[34.56 - 38.76] P:1778.75 E:0.100164 |  Well, as a test, there's an early test for Wilton Sampao,
[38.76 - 41.24] P:1677.76 E:0.097705 |  the Brazilian referee,
[41.24 - 44.64] P:1852.75 E:0.099940 |  and Luxor has actually just handed the ball
[44.64 - 47.08] P:1799.23 E:0.092798 |  from the side of the pitch to Dembele,
[47.08 - 51.76] P:1841.08 E:0.092132 |  and Dembele obligingly throws it back to Jordan Pickford.
[51.76 - 54.44] P:1878.42 E:0.096523 |  So, England and France.
[54.44 - 57.88] P:1716.64 E:0.105627 |  If England are to reach the semifinals, they will have to do something.
[58.16 - 59.80] P:1793.22 E:0.098984 |  They've never done before,
[59.80 - 63.68] P:1871.11 E:0.103303 |  not the current World Champions out at a World Cup.
[63.68 - 67.24] P:1765.79 E:0.093680 |  England with the ball on the left-hand side, up towards Bellingham.
[67.24 - 69.60] P:1677.86 E:0.101536 |  And then it's deflected out of play,
[69.60 - 72.56] P:1694.61 E:0.105390 |  and England have a throw, 10 yards inside the French half,
[72.56 - 75.60] P:1695.05 E:0.097465 |  but Luxor has come up to take.
[75.60 - 79.36] P:1855.85 E:0.106622 |  England at this World Cup, obviously won their group,
[79.36 - 81.88] P:1847.32 E:0.106787 |  beat the highest ranked team in Asia,
[81.88 - 84.84] P:1843.30 E:0.106813 |  played the champions of North and Central America,
[84.84 - 86.84] P:1742.90 E:0.115678 |  another home nation in Wales.
[86.88 - 89.16] P:1761.63 E:0.102170 |  They knocked out the African champions,
[89.16 - 91.80] P:1778.77 E:0.105313 |  but now it is the holders,
[91.80 - 94.88] P:1746.73 E:0.101642 |  and it is England in possession with Harry McQuire,
[94.88 - 98.52] P:1794.27 E:0.099471 |  puts his right foot on the ball, has a little look forward,
[98.52 - 100.72] P:1757.17 E:0.099279 |  and then plays a long pass down the left flank,
[100.72 - 101.76] P:1808.16 E:0.099656 |  which is headed in field.
[101.76 - 103.52] P:1831.49 E:0.100594 |  Phil's folding into the action for the first time,
[103.52 - 105.08] P:1847.05 E:0.093144 |  but Dembele was back there,
[105.08 - 108.04] P:1792.72 E:0.104408 |  and France are able to take possession on the edge of the penalty area
[108.04 - 110.36] P:1932.06 E:0.111972 |  with the McCarno and the pressure from Sampao,
[110.36 - 113.48] P:1977.05 E:0.111855 |  plays it away, and now it's being brought forward by Hernandez.
[113.48 - 115.60] P:1982.30 E:0.107436 |  He loves to get forward, K.O. Hernandez.
[115.64 - 118.20] P:1935.15 E:0.106722 |  Now Mbappe is in possession for the first time.
[118.20 - 119.36] P:1923.36 E:0.110762 |  Listen to the reaction.
[119.36 - 121.84] P:1935.06 E:0.110312 |  He takes on and moves inside Kyle Walker,
[121.84 - 123.92] P:1848.47 E:0.090599 |  but there were two England men there,
[123.92 - 126.12] P:1769.49 E:0.098388 |  both Saka and Henderson,
[126.12 - 127.52] P:1869.18 E:0.103724 |  and they forced Mbappe back,
[127.52 - 129.20] P:1774.90 E:0.105847 |  but he slips the ball in between them.
[129.20 - 131.60] P:1801.77 E:0.104034 |  Kyle Walker steps in, and there's Rabiot,
[131.60 - 133.36] P:1777.92 E:0.102032 |  to play it back towards the half-way line.
[133.36 - 135.92] P:1863.26 E:0.100608 |  So there we are, Rob Green, first round.
[135.92 - 140.16] P:1806.79 E:0.101892 |  Yep, it's one little opening there that hadn't Mbappe ready.
[140.16 - 141.56] P:1761.43 E:0.098831 |  He was waiting to pounce.
[141.56 - 145.28] P:1810.02 E:0.091462 |  Saka misjudging that pass, gambling, shouldn't have gone,
[145.28 - 149.32] P:1793.21 E:0.091511 |  and all of a sudden, Hernandez, as you say, John, loves to get forward.
[149.32 - 152.00] P:1975.60 E:0.099644 |  Yeah, they come again, this time a back heel from Mbappe
[152.00 - 154.04] P:1976.30 E:0.107757 |  near the edge of the England penalty area.
[154.04 - 157.08] P:1912.86 E:0.101610 |  Rabiot, but then Deutlund Reiss is able to come across,
[157.08 - 160.00] P:1776.16 E:0.107322 |  take the ball away, and that's a confidence booster early for him
[160.00 - 162.52] P:1960.47 E:0.106369 |  to play a little role like that.
[162.52 - 164.92] P:1900.60 E:0.112083 |  Yeah, every touch from these, England play the first touch,
[164.92 - 168.40] P:1922.14 E:0.099656 |  is just to get the feet in the game, but not only that.
[168.40 - 171.84] P:1954.80 E:0.102152 |  Oh, the ball's been won back by Saka near the centre-circle.
[171.84 - 173.96] P:1998.64 E:0.100776 |  He carries it forward, gives it to Kane on the right.
[174.00 - 178.00] P:1954.25 E:0.094072 |  Kane tried to cross it, but crossed it straight into Ufa-McCarno,
[178.00 - 179.92] P:1923.87 E:0.100074 |  and the ball bounces out towards the right-hand side,
[179.92 - 182.92] P:1898.79 E:0.101209 |  where Kane's able to flick it, actually, over his shoulder
[182.92 - 185.12] P:1933.18 E:0.089949 |  and infield towards Deutlund Reiss.
[185.12 - 188.00] P:1878.41 E:0.105227 |  And so Harry Kane drives a high pass towards the edge of the area.
[188.00 - 191.12] P:1901.78 E:0.096072 |  Faran comes across and is able to head it down,
[191.12 - 193.52] P:1889.37 E:0.100944 |  and now it's bouncing down into the left full-back position,
[193.52 - 195.60] P:1824.58 E:0.094272 |  where France will get it away,
[195.60 - 198.08] P:1946.21 E:0.106294 |  although Ufa-McCarno has given it straight to Henderson.
[198.08 - 202.16] P:1955.08 E:0.103723 |  And now Henderson to Fulton, and Fulton shot his block by Faran,
[202.20 - 206.20] P:1875.64 E:0.094838 |  who is right in front of him, on the edge of the box, Manchester City,
[206.20 - 208.12] P:1857.64 E:0.094691 |  blocked by Manchester United.
[208.12 - 212.52] P:1868.17 E:0.104550 |  But there are so many familiar confrontations on the pitch this evening,
[212.52 - 215.88] P:1942.43 E:0.103257 |  as England come down the left-hand side with Bellingham.
[215.88 - 219.24] P:1897.48 E:0.105102 |  Griezmann is right back there, almost in his own right-back position,
[219.24 - 221.08] P:1776.71 E:0.082686 |  to put in the challenge on Bellingham,
[221.08 - 224.16] P:1820.08 E:0.089530 |  and it was a successful one, and the French have it.
[224.16 - 229.00] P:1792.06 E:0.098927 |  England nail, France nail on this Saturday night.
[229.36 - 234.80] P:1840.54 E:0.106196 |  There is live Champions Cup rugby union on Sports Extra right now,
[234.80 - 236.84] P:1931.18 E:0.107811 |  but there's every chance you might be travelling back
[236.84 - 240.24] P:1844.33 E:0.100823 |  from one of the matches domestically this evening.
[240.24 - 243.84] P:1817.58 E:0.109412 |  And if you are in your car, I would imagine you're glued to this,
[243.84 - 246.68] P:1969.32 E:0.107691 |  as Maguire wins the ball back from Griezmann.
[246.68 - 250.80] P:1936.25 E:0.096160 |  And now Maguire in front of the centre-circle, angles are passed,
[250.80 - 253.60] P:1829.80 E:0.097201 |  out towards the left-hand side, Thordon takes it down,
[253.60 - 255.72] P:1883.58 E:0.105018 |  Phil Thordon, still England in possession,
[255.72 - 258.20] P:1828.72 E:0.100765 |  Bellingham is out there as well, Bellingham.
[258.32 - 262.04] P:1861.87 E:0.102496 |  Then to Luxior, who dances away from the challenge of Griezmann.
[262.04 - 265.44] P:1897.21 E:0.098349 |  Bellingham turns, still two Frenchmen in front of it.
[265.44 - 268.64] P:2009.50 E:0.113804 |  And then Thordon with a flick, De Ballet with a challenge,
[268.64 - 270.92] P:1937.04 E:0.106885 |  and the referee says, yes, free kick England.
[270.92 - 273.20] P:1832.06 E:0.103831 |  Yeah, really strong start by England, confidence start,
[273.20 - 276.88] P:1817.59 E:0.098837 |  one on the front foot, and it's two styles, England pressing,
[276.88 - 279.60] P:1737.45 E:0.100632 |  they lose the ball high in the France half, they're going,
[279.60 - 281.24] P:1794.63 E:0.100572 |  they're going for it, they're looking to press,
[281.24 - 284.60] P:1759.01 E:0.093768 |  Sackle one-one, misjudged the other, that's the risk.
[284.60 - 287.88] P:1720.09 E:0.108480 |  France will drop, they'll drop into that medium to low block,
[287.88 - 289.68] P:1877.73 E:0.093318 |  that Julian was talking about,
[289.68 - 292.72] P:1881.25 E:0.101675 |  they're comfortable sitting in their own half.
[292.72 - 295.64] P:1924.27 E:0.101290 |  So a free kick, first free kick on the left-hand side.
[295.64 - 298.44] P:1777.97 E:0.106520 |  England, at the 12 goals that they've scored at this World Cup,
[298.44 - 301.04] P:1849.16 E:0.094648 |  only two have been from set pieces.
[301.04 - 303.56] P:1859.90 E:0.112353 |  So here is Luxior waiting on the left-hand side,
[303.56 - 307.80] P:1845.68 E:0.097279 |  England who are playing from left to right as we look in this first half.
[307.80 - 311.04] P:1911.31 E:0.097817 |  Sure, waiting, one foot in front of the other on the left-hand side.
[311.04 - 314.72] P:1777.63 E:0.101024 |  Referee still sorting one or two things out on the edge of the penalty area.
[314.72 - 317.76] P:1832.32 E:0.104733 |  Harry Maguire, the eye is naturally drawn to him,
[317.80 - 319.92] P:1841.84 E:0.110625 |  right towards the far side of the penalty area,
[319.92 - 323.84] P:1982.88 E:0.103174 |  Shaw swings it in, Maguire is deepening the air,
[323.84 - 325.32] P:1840.70 E:0.112395 |  and the ball is headed away,
[325.32 - 328.20] P:1916.26 E:0.094229 |  and actually there was an offside flag up against England,
[328.20 - 331.68] P:1962.12 E:0.099626 |  and it's a free kick to the French in their own penalty area.
[333.48 - 337.84] P:1950.62 E:0.110813 |  An interesting little battle in there, Harry Kane looking to block the runs.
[338.84 - 341.36] P:2020.36 E:0.115719 |  Just Maguire was a fraction offside, maybe,
[341.36 - 345.48] P:1959.89 E:0.109390 |  but Kane was doing the blocking for Declan Rice in the centre,
[345.52 - 348.00] P:1952.87 E:0.099567 |  Maguire and Stones at the far post.
[348.00 - 349.64] P:1883.48 E:0.101070 |  It's a formidable force,
[349.64 - 352.36] P:1838.08 E:0.098169 |  and as you look at it for England attacking that ball.
[352.36 - 354.16] P:1963.16 E:0.100700 |  England, Nill, France, Nill.
[354.16 - 359.24] P:1824.86 E:0.101318 |  So this is five-live, via BBC Sounds as well, if you're on the move tonight,
[359.24 - 364.20] P:1899.57 E:0.092166 |  and we're also live across Africa on the World Service tonight.
[364.20 - 367.80] P:1897.54 E:0.099932 |  The two goals, by the way, from the set pieces that England have scored so far,
[367.80 - 370.36] P:1971.92 E:0.097606 |  the goal that Saka scored in the first match against Iran,
[370.36 - 372.56] P:1932.42 E:0.096208 |  which came from a corner, from Shaw,
[372.56 - 374.60] P:1813.26 E:0.100202 |  which was headed across the box by Maguire,
[374.64 - 378.12] P:1856.99 E:0.097941 |  and the other was the free kick, the Marcus Rashford free kick,
[378.12 - 381.72] P:1891.22 E:0.099898 |  against Wales in the third group match.
[381.72 - 383.40] P:1891.34 E:0.101969 |  Rashford on the bench tonight,
[383.40 - 386.40] P:1976.57 E:0.107938 |  a long ball forward from the back, four France, Walker heads it down,
[386.40 - 388.28] P:1964.42 E:0.117207 |  but he's headed it straight to Giroux,
[388.28 - 390.36] P:2007.57 E:0.106534 |  and now Mbappe with the right-footed ball,
[390.36 - 392.72] P:1969.39 E:0.113746 |  Maguire with a challenge on Giroux in the area,
[392.72 - 395.64] P:1833.35 E:0.103345 |  who couldn't get to it, England struggling to get it away.
[395.64 - 398.92] P:1807.98 E:0.092338 |  Dembale on the right-hand side, comes back centrally, Kunde is there,
[398.92 - 402.20] P:1891.36 E:0.097619 |  his left-footed ball is straight into the part of Shaw, who took a heavy touch,
[402.20 - 404.48] P:1877.71 E:0.102550 |  and Dembale was there, so Shaw had to quickly...
[404.92 - 406.48] P:1795.60 E:0.107687 |  recover and put it out of play.
[406.48 - 409.00] P:1827.16 E:0.105729 |  Now, discussion going on between Stones and Walker.
[409.84 - 413.04] P:1849.95 E:0.100321 |  He didn't hear the call, he's saying, we heard it from up here.
[413.04 - 415.56] P:1835.75 E:0.099609 |  Just play it back to Pickford, he was waiting.
[415.56 - 418.44] P:1849.98 E:0.095635 |  That's Rob Green, England's World Cup goalkeeper.
[418.44 - 422.00] P:1826.48 E:0.090865 |  We're watching from on high, up here on the top tier,
[422.00 - 423.96] P:1836.86 E:0.098146 |  at this Al-Beh stadium.
[424.76 - 427.20] P:1691.18 E:0.105068 |  The dark, desert skies are bulged,
[427.20 - 429.68] P:1747.84 E:0.094445 |  and the other thing that we've not mentioned is,
[429.68 - 431.72] P:1835.43 E:0.099416 |  this is, by a distance,
[431.76 - 437.04] P:1837.49 E:0.096623 |  the inverted commas, coolest night of this World Cup so far,
[437.04 - 438.96] P:1654.53 E:0.105237 |  as Henderson carries the ball forward,
[438.96 - 441.04] P:1789.73 E:0.083426 |  and then it's played back into the back line.
[441.04 - 444.32] P:1752.53 E:0.108297 |  I don't think there's many people at home having much sympathy for us out here.
[444.32 - 447.24] P:1871.87 E:0.084489 |  That is a very good point.
[447.24 - 449.16] P:1794.46 E:0.087650 |  Henderson, out to the left.
[449.16 - 451.16] P:1684.07 E:0.095789 |  It's quite breezy as well,
[451.16 - 454.20] P:1762.49 E:0.077122 |  but it's clops on tonight,
[454.20 - 458.76] P:1873.61 E:0.089645 |  as Maguire plays the ball to the right, to Stones.
[458.76 - 461.40] P:1809.69 E:0.087769 |  Here gives it back to Maguire.
[461.40 - 464.48] P:1810.23 E:0.104744 |  He has a little look forward, and then drags the ball onto his right foot
[464.48 - 466.00] P:1927.06 E:0.103659 |  and goes for a long, long pass,
[466.00 - 469.68] P:1947.45 E:0.105679 |  which I think will be beyond Sakuride's and Ben's's through for a goal kick.
[469.68 - 473.48] P:1884.55 E:0.102964 |  So England, France, Mill, Mark mentioned earlier,
[473.48 - 477.28] P:1863.84 E:0.105060 |  the terrible news about the death of our journalistic colleague,
[477.28 - 481.40] P:1947.53 E:0.093576 |  Grant Wall, last night, who was at the match, the late match last night.
[482.40 - 484.64] P:1989.77 E:0.101333 |  FIFA have paid tribute to him tonight,
[484.64 - 489.40] P:1867.22 E:0.089473 |  and have put a bouquet on his assigned seat for this match inside the stadium.
[489.88 - 494.60] P:1877.02 E:0.081200 |  So they've got a lot of things wrong, FIFA, but that is a nice touch.
[495.88 - 500.28] P:1807.45 E:0.095728 |  Goal kick that Loris will take down there to our right.
[500.28 - 506.32] P:1877.04 E:0.102196 |  143rd cap, it's also a record 18th World Cup appearance for France.
[506.32 - 508.92] P:1859.95 E:0.099958 |  He's making this evening, Bellingham getting up high,
[508.92 - 513.76] P:1888.93 E:0.095321 |  but Rabiot is head-and-a-cross, there's a stretch from Giroud,
[513.76 - 516.28] P:1842.09 E:0.093627 |  who plays the ball back into his own half.
[516.40 - 520.08] P:1817.35 E:0.102050 |  And France start with Varan, who just works it towards the right-hand side.
[520.08 - 523.28] P:1853.54 E:0.105108 |  Dempeli is there, Griezmann looking for those spaces.
[523.28 - 527.40] P:1946.70 E:0.112696 |  Back to Dempeli, whose low ball in is all half cleared on the edge,
[527.40 - 530.28] P:1916.66 E:0.097594 |  with the six-yard box by Stones.
[530.28 - 533.32] P:1832.37 E:0.103080 |  England were a little fortunate there that that didn't drop to a blue shirt.
[533.32 - 535.44] P:1866.08 E:0.095467 |  Yeah, really, good block by John Stones.
[535.44 - 538.80] P:1866.20 E:0.096592 |  Out, stretch right, like just getting the faintest of touches was enough,
[538.80 - 541.40] P:1738.70 E:0.097864 |  but that play down right, rather than what we anticipated,
[541.40 - 543.44] P:1803.64 E:0.100699 |  down the left, opened us up.
[543.48 - 544.72] P:1956.68 E:0.113422 |  Yeah, Griezmann, this is good.
[544.72 - 546.80] P:1840.39 E:0.105342 |  Dempeli and Griezmann together on the right-hand side,
[546.80 - 551.12] P:1963.60 E:0.113962 |  Jake's almost past them, Bellingham puts in the challenge, went to ground.
[551.12 - 554.56] P:1906.31 E:0.106545 |  He's saying that he deflected the ball back onto Griezmann in behind,
[554.56 - 558.32] P:1841.58 E:0.108921 |  but the assistant on the far side says, corner France.
[558.32 - 561.36] P:1892.12 E:0.113736 |  Still a photos, just a little fraction too high.
[561.36 - 563.84] P:1868.17 E:0.113958 |  He's leaving, Luxor exposed out there,
[563.84 - 568.32] P:1871.91 E:0.100352 |  against the two of Griezmann, who's drifted out there with Dempeli.
[568.32 - 570.40] P:1895.72 E:0.109907 |  Very difficult to hinder out to the two of them.
[570.40 - 572.28] P:1957.00 E:0.101350 |  So England now have to face the set piece.
[572.28 - 576.40] P:1892.59 E:0.100983 |  And the referee, bright orange shirt, has trotted across with meaning
[576.40 - 581.08] P:1867.75 E:0.094026 |  to talk to Jordan Pickford, 50th cap tonight, clean sheets in his last three here
[581.08 - 582.28] P:1837.33 E:0.089814 |  at this World Cup.
[582.28 - 586.52] P:1857.02 E:0.093095 |  Bapé is standing on him, players are grouped around the penalty spot.
[586.52 - 589.24] P:1894.31 E:0.103030 |  Three England, four England players standing in front of it,
[589.24 - 592.68] P:1880.30 E:0.101236 |  the French players in the line, a little bit like the England set piece routine
[592.68 - 593.92] P:1886.32 E:0.095057 |  at the last World Cup.
[593.92 - 596.68] P:1896.27 E:0.112752 |  So Griezmann with a corner delivery into the near post, is headed away.
[596.68 - 601.68] P:1990.89 E:0.102447 |  Harry Kane was there, inside the six-yard box at the near post, and folded.
[601.72 - 606.80] P:2002.46 E:0.098995 |  He's able to get a deflection off Dempeli, and it's out for a throw in to England.
[606.80 - 607.80] P:1941.74 E:0.076744 |  Deltwith.
[607.80 - 609.76] P:1761.96 E:0.105426 |  Yeah, there's a good header by Harry Kane.
[609.76 - 612.64] P:1905.05 E:0.110936 |  John Snow's a just-losted man, I think it's Olivier Giroud.
[612.64 - 615.68] P:1944.12 E:0.095426 |  Just by half a yard, it's so difficult in there.
[615.68 - 619.36] P:1914.27 E:0.098540 |  Having all those bodies, you've got to find your man, stay with him, tracking.
[619.36 - 622.72] P:1934.41 E:0.097783 |  And of course, they're hot on the holding in this World Cup.
[622.72 - 628.20] P:1912.46 E:0.094077 |  Yeah, Yulia Ferre, defended set pieces against Olivier Giroud.
[628.20 - 630.60] P:1763.10 E:0.092145 |  He's a real presence in there, isn't he?
[630.64 - 632.24] P:1978.20 E:0.108029 |  He's cute, cute in the mind.
[632.24 - 635.04] P:1979.14 E:0.108652 |  Oh, and back the course, went back by Frank Transe,
[635.04 - 637.68] P:1979.12 E:0.109617 |  shore caught up the field, Griezmann out to the right.
[637.68 - 642.00] P:1993.14 E:0.108813 |  That's like diving head-off from Giroud, but it's straight at goalkeeper Pickford.
[642.00 - 646.04] P:2004.30 E:0.102887 |  He had to stretch for that, and Stones was putting him under pressure as well.
[646.04 - 649.68] P:1904.91 E:0.095918 |  And he headed it probably through about knee-thigh height, but straight at Pickford.
[649.68 - 653.68] P:1811.66 E:0.099298 |  Nihon impossible to score from there, going back towards your own goal.
[653.68 - 658.04] P:1803.31 E:0.094663 |  Getting the angle on it was hard, but Luke Shaw is isolated out there.
[658.04 - 660.64] P:1741.32 E:0.092413 |  England just needs to readjust slightly.
[660.64 - 664.48] P:1696.91 E:0.101340 |  Thought the threat was going to come down the left, and a minute, de Ballet,
[664.48 - 668.76] P:1756.14 E:0.108464 |  he's finding space down the right, and it's all due to Griezmann just drifting.
[668.76 - 670.24] P:1820.18 E:0.106572 |  And they're onto that, Frank Transe.
[670.24 - 674.32] P:1836.77 E:0.103086 |  Didier Deschamps and his team have either worked on that before the match,
[674.32 - 676.12] P:1862.87 E:0.109228 |  or they've spotted it already in this game,
[676.12 - 679.48] P:1779.52 E:0.095632 |  and Griezmann is spending a lot of time over there.
[679.48 - 685.20] P:1971.03 E:0.103194 |  So first savoured the match then, first attempt on goal, on target by Olivier Giroud.
[685.28 - 687.36] P:1795.01 E:0.097149 |  But England, with a ball on the other side,
[687.36 - 693.68] P:1783.85 E:0.086071 |  their right-flat walker plays it centrally to the 19-year-old, Jude Dalingham.
[694.96 - 699.92] P:1813.19 E:0.092492 |  Being such an important figure in this England run to the last eight of the World Cup.
[699.92 - 702.76] P:1849.40 E:0.096733 |  If you have just got into your car, switched on your radio,
[702.76 - 707.68] P:1874.76 E:0.095989 |  the extraordinary news of the World Cup already today is that Morocco are through
[707.68 - 713.04] P:1889.33 E:0.090069 |  to the last four, the first African team to reach the semifinals of the World Cup.
[713.08 - 720.40] P:1948.51 E:0.099783 |  And Morocco will play the winners of this one on Wednesday night in this stadium.
[720.40 - 726.12] P:1915.48 E:0.095899 |  And that will be like this one, seven o'clock kick-off in the UK,
[726.12 - 728.60] P:1802.65 E:0.092313 |  ten o'clock kick-off here in Qatar.
[729.68 - 732.08] P:1858.51 E:0.096374 |  France with a ball inside their own heart.
[733.44 - 738.64] P:1895.99 E:0.098397 |  And back it goes into the round, just touches out towards the left-hand side.
[739.52 - 743.28] P:1952.79 E:0.108676 |  And now up on the car now, looking for Theo Hernandez.
[743.92 - 750.24] P:1866.27 E:0.098902 |  Theo Hernandez moving in field and then knocking it back into central defence to Varan.
[751.28 - 759.64] P:1935.47 E:0.093065 |  Missed the first match, Varan, that having fear that he would miss the whole World Cup
[759.64 - 762.32] P:1892.15 E:0.100163 |  with that injury at Chelsea really just a few weeks ago.
[763.20 - 766.52] P:1859.43 E:0.100268 |  It's been a remarkable recovery for the Manchester United now.
[767.00 - 770.68] P:1767.50 E:0.101109 |  Theo Hernandez again, touches foot on the ball and then passes it back into the centre-circle.
[770.68 - 774.80] P:1807.65 E:0.098251 |  England are just sitting off the World Champions at the moment, Varan coming forward again.
[774.80 - 777.36] P:1826.56 E:0.098565 |  There's Griezmann out towards the right-hand side again.
[777.36 - 783.44] P:1880.50 E:0.100986 |  Griezmann squared and Rabiol then back to Griezmann and then out comes Henderson to put Griezmann under pressure.
[784.16 - 788.92] P:1825.70 E:0.099605 |  Theo Hernandez once more and it goes back to the halfway line to Ufa Mokami.
[788.92 - 792.32] P:2022.82 E:0.115050 |  And then in comes Reis for the challenge, that's good, excellent tackle.
[792.32 - 795.88] P:2037.69 E:0.103627 |  Harry Kane is able to take it on, he's got Frenchman either side of him.
[795.88 - 799.72] P:1983.84 E:0.101479 |  Kane is forced to take it out towards the right flank, Reis is there as well.
[800.44 - 803.96] P:1910.82 E:0.097701 |  Henderson behind him and Henderson goes back to the halfway line.
[804.52 - 805.24] P:1901.60 E:0.100900 |  What a tackle.
[805.24 - 809.96] P:1829.66 E:0.098093 |  Yeah, brilliant and we've seen it so many times with Declan Reis waiting, picking the pass to attack,
[809.96 - 811.28] P:1888.91 E:0.089409 |  did it with conviction.
[812.92 - 816.28] P:1878.86 E:0.102791 |  So it is now England with the ball inside the French half.
[817.12 - 820.44] P:1917.33 E:0.107482 |  And here is Declan Reis again, had a confident start to the game.
[820.92 - 824.76] P:1893.37 E:0.104891 |  Reis back again to Walker who looks up.
[825.00 - 832.44] P:1929.37 E:0.095033 |  England with the back four again tonight, again the 4-3-3 as Walker takes it again from Jordan Henderson.
[833.00 - 839.72] P:1877.19 E:0.087556 |  So now again seven players have started all five matches that England have played at this World Cup.
[839.72 - 843.96] P:1787.33 E:0.089169 |  So that is real consistency of selection for the second time at the tournament.
[843.96 - 850.36] P:1812.23 E:0.096962 |  Garry Southgate's name and unchanged team having not done it in 53 matches.
[850.52 - 854.52] P:1899.12 E:0.109924 |  The first time in end of unchanged team in 54 matches against USA.
[855.08 - 859.80] P:2020.26 E:0.108741 |  Henderson's giving it away, Rabiot will take it on, Saka's trying to get there, he goes into the box,
[859.80 - 864.20] P:1970.14 E:0.102838 |  gives it to him, Pappe crosses to the back post but Dempelet can't get there,
[864.20 - 870.20] P:1924.88 E:0.102580 |  Shaw went with him, they were shoulder to shoulder and Dempelet on the stretch could only put it behind the far post.
[870.20 - 876.28] P:1900.76 E:0.099908 |  Well there's the danger from France, Jordan Henderson who's just a slow square ball inside
[876.36 - 881.24] P:1781.05 E:0.088587 |  that lack of pace on the ball allowed Rabiot, it's a pounce and from there could they find him,
[881.24 - 888.52] P:1882.44 E:0.091116 |  Pappe they could, could he find Dempelet at the far post, he couldn't but France sit, they wait,
[888.52 - 893.40] P:1866.50 E:0.093254 |  they'll be patient, they know they've got the ability, they've got the pace, the hurt is on the break.
[893.96 - 900.68] P:1856.31 E:0.100067 |  England, Niel, France, Niel BBC Radio 5 live, 6-0-6 tonight as well by the way from 10 o'clock UK time.
[900.68 - 905.40] P:1865.55 E:0.106124 |  Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton will be taking your calls, now the TD highlights on the Saturday night,
[905.40 - 910.28] P:1958.78 E:0.110686 |  BBC One after the news and then the World Cup Daily podcast in the morning with all of the
[910.28 - 918.12] P:1907.87 E:0.107386 |  fallout and reaction from whatever happens over the course of the next hour and a half all there abouts.
[919.16 - 927.16] P:1879.72 E:0.105739 |  Still goalless, Maguire and Stoves intercession, now Jordan Henderson after that little error
[927.16 - 934.12] P:1876.54 E:0.086465 |  could have been costly but England were able to repel the French, Dullingham to the left hand side,
[934.12 - 939.16] P:1734.41 E:0.099404 |  to Luke Shaw and England again content to have it inside their own half.
[941.72 - 947.64] P:1772.04 E:0.101730 |  Maguire and now Henderson almost dropping back in between the two central defenders.
[947.64 - 951.96] P:1717.71 E:0.099097 |  Yeah the difference between France and England at the moment is the two wide meant of France
[951.96 - 955.32] P:1783.12 E:0.099708 |  hanging wide, England are coming narrow making the pitch narrow.
[955.32 - 960.44] P:1892.24 E:0.099979 |  Rice turns, it's the ball to Walker on the right hand side, Walker has Saka, Saka is forced out
[960.44 - 965.48] P:1997.78 E:0.111865 |  into a wide position, he's claiming that he was fouled, no free kick given, it's being brought
[965.48 - 971.32] P:1953.15 E:0.097301 |  forward from the back by Upa Mercano by Inmunic, he gives that to Umpape of Paris Saint-Germain
[971.32 - 975.48] P:1865.31 E:0.099807 |  and Umpape had three England players around it and Umpame Mercano is still there and Umpape now
[975.48 - 980.36] P:1895.98 E:0.101965 |  gets away from Rice, he's central, gives the ball to the right hand side to Gembelli in the box
[980.36 - 984.60] P:1746.57 E:0.101887 |  and Umpape is still available on the edge of the area, back it comes to Griezmann, 20 yards out,
[984.60 - 986.84] P:1923.36 E:0.111655 |  now back with the shot, oh what a goal!
[989.56 - 995.96] P:2029.87 E:0.118911 |  To Umpape, from 23 yards, the cleanest of strikes,
[996.84 - 1001.08] P:1956.70 E:0.121214 |  France take the lead and for the first time in this world, Governing the W.
[1002.76 - 1006.20] P:1815.36 E:0.123506 |  16 minutes played, England nil, France won.
[1007.48 - 1011.88] P:1849.91 E:0.113020 |  Well we thought it might be something special and it was, it may not be from the people,
[1011.88 - 1017.64] P:1857.42 E:0.108959 |  we thought it would be but the threat is there, if you double up out wide it leaves the space in
[1017.64 - 1024.68] P:1797.61 E:0.105544 |  the middle, Germaini stood waiting in the centre of the pitch all the time and space that he wanted
[1024.68 - 1031.64] P:1808.57 E:0.109177 |  to pick the ball up, he was a long way out, he had a good touch, he picked his spot and he hammered
[1031.64 - 1038.12] P:1812.53 E:0.113152 |  it into the corner, three players on one side of the pitch, Tracod and Mbappe, two players on the
[1038.12 - 1043.40] P:1821.34 E:0.109027 |  other side of the pitch with them felling, there's got to be space somewhere, there is in the middle
[1043.40 - 1050.60] P:1885.94 E:0.112328 |  and it's a well worked goal from France. Just took a touch, it was pinpoint, Tickford diving down
[1050.60 - 1060.12] P:1860.65 E:0.103553 |  to his right and on his 50th cap he couldn't get there and the ball was buried into the bottom
[1060.12 - 1066.20] P:1868.62 E:0.098444 |  corner of the England net, France ahead, England behind and the goal was scored just a few yards
[1066.20 - 1072.52] P:1791.71 E:0.101915 |  away from Juliette Farrington. And the celebrations took place at the corner flag to my right John
[1072.52 - 1077.72] P:1779.41 E:0.092847 |  and Jordan Tickford has just taken his place right back at the game restarted, he had a long
[1077.72 - 1083.40] P:1701.14 E:0.089211 |  conversation with Declan Rice and John Stones, he's looking so frustrated and also with
[1083.40 - 1089.00] P:1688.96 E:0.096156 |  Carrie Maguire on that one, hands on hips but the game is back under way, Tickford seems to be now
[1089.64 - 1095.88] P:1820.87 E:0.092108 |  trying to control his frustrations as he's watching on over the pitch. Well England have not
[1095.88 - 1102.92] P:1857.08 E:0.100467 |  been in this position at this World Cup, one nil down, so England have to respond, Tsuomenei
[1103.56 - 1111.08] P:1906.83 E:0.103262 |  scoring brilliantly really, the Real Madrid youngster just 22 years old, just his second goal for France
[1111.08 - 1117.64] P:1902.24 E:0.105833 |  and now England with Saka on the right hand side, Henderson on the overlap, Saka plays it back to
[1117.64 - 1122.76] P:1979.32 E:0.110695 |  Kyle Walker, going in suggesting he might have been fouled on the edge of the box off the ball,
[1122.76 - 1127.88] P:1965.75 E:0.113167 |  however it is Saka again, Saka moving in field, that was a foul by Rabiol,
[1127.88 - 1133.40] P:1992.38 E:0.104890 |  went in rather clumsily and rather heavily on Saka and it is a free kick right of centre
[1133.40 - 1141.48] P:1864.74 E:0.098600 |  and this is what 22-23 yards out, he's done very very fortunate not to get a yellow card there,
[1141.48 - 1147.88] P:1877.47 E:0.099808 |  he goes down, two-footed tackle from behind, not a great deal of force in it, which probably saved
[1148.44 - 1152.52] P:1880.53 E:0.099868 |  him, but a threat for England, Luke Shaw standing over the ball, he'll fancy this.
[1153.80 - 1158.20] P:1937.65 E:0.103807 |  So it is a sad piece of opportunity, England going behind in the 17th minute,
[1159.08 - 1166.92] P:1967.35 E:0.103047 |  that excellent strike it really was, so purely hit on his right foot, but England
[1168.52 - 1175.32] P:1923.04 E:0.096281 |  with Henderson and Shaw and also John Stones has just walked out of the England,
[1175.40 - 1181.88] P:1938.13 E:0.100489 |  putting up a wall next to the French wall, there is a four Frenchman standing in the
[1183.16 - 1189.16] P:1925.74 E:0.116340 |  actual wall, Griesman's on the corner of it, Henderson is pointing at McGuire and now they've
[1189.16 - 1194.84] P:1985.18 E:0.115346 |  backed away and Luke Shaw is left alone, although Jordan Henderson is still making urges and he's
[1194.84 - 1202.12] P:1860.79 E:0.106190 |  telling what it is Harry Kendo is in position on the edge of that wall, so McGuire, there are
[1202.12 - 1207.96] P:1857.28 E:0.113921 |  two England players in this in this wall to the left, as Shaw is looking at it, could be Henderson,
[1207.96 - 1212.52] P:1945.13 E:0.114300 |  could be Shaw, Henderson runs over it, Luke Shaw hits it, but it's sprayed out, Laurie's
[1213.16 - 1218.04] P:2001.06 E:0.115023 |  who's able to take what one and a half steps to his left and gather the ball into his chest.
[1218.60 - 1225.56] P:1895.82 E:0.106784 |  Quick free from Laurie's, it's just that gap between McGuire and Kane, allowed him to see the ball,
[1225.56 - 1230.84] P:1909.65 E:0.109382 |  if you're going to put a wall up, stand together, it's a nightmare for a goalkeeper, don't give that gap,
[1232.36 - 1240.20] P:1976.14 E:0.105597 |  England nil, France won, the only goal for Didier Deschamps side, clinical,
[1240.84 - 1246.20] P:2032.40 E:0.109427 |  and Didier Deschamps standing down there now on the edge of the coaching area, out of contract
[1246.20 - 1251.56] P:1910.85 E:0.097341 |  after this World Cup, what a career, World Cup winning coach, World Cup winning captain,
[1251.56 - 1258.20] P:1843.03 E:0.095549 |  won the Euros, won the Champions League, I mean he's almost done it all and now he's attempting
[1258.20 - 1267.40] P:1930.25 E:0.100840 |  to become the first coach to win back to back World Cups, since real well the early days of the
[1267.40 - 1272.52] P:1851.71 E:0.102413 |  competition, it is England in possession on the halfway line, Stones, Stones just moving the ball
[1272.52 - 1278.36] P:1823.13 E:0.101371 |  across the centre circle and then Bellingham drops deep and will knock it square, Walker who's stretched
[1278.36 - 1283.80] P:1921.63 E:0.106054 |  for that and then Stones nicely turns away from trouble, as Bellingham in front of him,
[1283.88 - 1289.80] P:1900.33 E:0.104494 |  uses Jordan Henderson, now Saka on the right hand side, Saka, Henderson on the overlap, Saka little
[1289.80 - 1295.24] P:2026.27 E:0.116746 |  ball into the box, oh great turn by Kane, out comes Loris, makes the save, Henderson chips it across to
[1295.24 - 1300.60] P:1997.67 E:0.116213 |  the back post, a stretch there by Bellingham, it bounces down in Griesman, is able to clear it away,
[1300.60 - 1305.16] P:1964.79 E:0.115158 |  what a turn by Kane to get away from up on McCano inside the box, but what a save from
[1305.16 - 1311.16] P:1870.81 E:0.111265 |  Loris against his clubmate, fantastic save ready really well, came sliding out low, but managed
[1311.16 - 1317.40] P:1925.44 E:0.095570 |  to hold his arm up high to block the chip, did that for such clever play from Kane, you can't gamble
[1317.40 - 1324.36] P:1940.82 E:0.089207 |  like that, you can't think you're gonna win it, you can't, you can't nick it, he was out so quickly
[1324.36 - 1330.92] P:1887.95 E:0.088596 |  there and there we are, that's the first first time that they have faced off in this game,
[1332.68 - 1337.48] P:1684.32 E:0.110445 |  he was asked about potentially taking penalties against him last night, Harry Kane, he said well
[1337.48 - 1341.56] P:1764.85 E:0.102763 |  you know the thing is I hardly ever take penalties against him at club level, normally take penalties
[1341.56 - 1346.92] P:1810.65 E:0.094505 |  against second third choice goalkeepers, not your first choice, there is that, he's also seen a few,
[1349.72 - 1356.60] P:1858.25 E:0.101884 |  so England denied by the French captain, World Cup winning captain of four years ago,
[1357.48 - 1361.56] P:1941.92 E:0.105045 |  France currently with this goal line on course to get for the semi-finals again,
[1361.88 - 1367.56] P:1872.18 E:0.097462 |  Griezmann playing the ball back to up on McCano, the D on the edge of the penalty area, significant
[1367.56 - 1372.36] P:1980.04 E:0.107923 |  triumph that was though for Kane against him, but France working it forward really nicely and
[1372.36 - 1378.76] P:1991.41 E:0.108027 |  Bapu, those passes intercepted on the halfway line, Beringham Henderson, Beringham wanted it played
[1378.76 - 1383.72] P:1877.56 E:0.108666 |  down the line, challenge came in from Theo Hernandez, ball runs out of play into the French coaching
[1383.72 - 1390.60] P:1937.20 E:0.097770 |  area and it is an England throw, so Tua Mane becomes only the fourth French player to score at this
[1390.60 - 1400.68] P:1798.86 E:0.094589 |  World Cup after himself and Bapu with his five, Giroud and Rabiot who scored the first French
[1400.68 - 1405.00] P:1845.61 E:0.108297 |  goal of the tournament, the full-on win against Australia, England with it in the centre circle,
[1405.00 - 1410.68] P:1783.42 E:0.098738 |  here's John Stones, Bane to Henderson, it's been played at a good tempo, I'm sure the temperature
[1410.68 - 1416.20] P:1742.83 E:0.092968 |  tonight will help with that, Shaw on the left hand side, got the air conditioning of course,
[1416.76 - 1423.16] P:1829.72 E:0.092807 |  but it does feel significantly less warm here tonight, Rice puts his foot on the ball and plays
[1423.16 - 1432.76] P:1762.22 E:0.090352 |  it out to the left hand side to Luke Shaw, now back to McIntyre, so England, Garry Southgate with
[1432.76 - 1440.12] P:1637.82 E:0.097667 |  things to ponder as he stands with his hands in his pockets and watches Harry Kane drop into the
[1440.12 - 1446.12] P:1668.93 E:0.104022 |  centre circle, Rice is there, Thornton comes deep, then Rice forward and through the middle,
[1446.12 - 1451.16] P:1911.70 E:0.115756 |  the Kane, all lovely touch, through towards Bellingham, he's claiming Harry Kane was actually talking
[1451.16 - 1456.36] P:1741.85 E:0.106967 |  to the referee when Bellingham tried to flick it back to Kane, yeah it's handball to try and
[1456.36 - 1461.32] P:1916.63 E:0.113984 |  block the through ball to Bellingham, he's appealed, momentary pause, the situation,
[1461.32 - 1467.64] P:1786.07 E:0.103164 |  or the opportunity went for England because the return ball had come, he does look sharp, I must say
[1468.60 - 1472.36] P:1781.15 E:0.111152 |  Saka hits it in field, but heads it straight to the bombacado and now
[1472.36 - 1477.88] P:1951.59 E:0.111046 |  Hernandez, the left back has given it away, Kane, Kane is into the penalty area, goes down
[1477.88 - 1482.12] P:2009.95 E:0.111295 |  there's a challenge, Kane's flair on his face in the box under that challenge from up on the
[1482.12 - 1487.40] P:1974.04 E:0.112730 |  corner, the referee was close probably eight yards away and he immediately said no, ball
[1487.40 - 1493.96] P:1885.04 E:0.111744 |  bounces out of play on the halfway line, Kane still standing with palms apart, the question is, well
[1494.68 - 1499.08] P:1983.58 E:0.116126 |  I must say that looks like a penalty to me, there's contact, there's a throw of the leg,
[1499.08 - 1504.12] P:2000.76 E:0.103297 |  he goes to play the ball between Harry Kane's leg, that's a penalty, that's a penalty, it's soft
[1504.12 - 1508.60] P:1950.51 E:0.109538 |  but it's from behind, he doesn't win the ball, it's a penalty, it was right on the edge of the
[1508.60 - 1513.96] P:1914.88 E:0.102823 |  penalty area, suppose there's a question there and we are now having a check, the throwing's not been
[1513.96 - 1520.52] P:1892.29 E:0.099786 |  taken, there is a check going on, a VAR check for a possible penalty and we might have that,
[1520.52 - 1526.52] P:1884.11 E:0.102240 |  Kane against Laurie's moment, who we were talking about long before a possible penalty shootout,
[1526.52 - 1533.88] P:1911.34 E:0.103480 |  still the check is going on, the referee just turns away and says I'm still waiting, still waiting,
[1533.88 - 1540.60] P:1867.67 E:0.109315 |  Walker has got the ball to take the throw and the referee is just saying halt, he's putting his hand
[1540.60 - 1547.56] P:1857.06 E:0.113926 |  up like one of those old-time policemen and saying do not take the throw yet, this is a long, long
[1548.52 - 1554.44] P:1988.71 E:0.116108 |  to the naked eye, it seems clear that Kane was caught on the leg by Obama-McCarno,
[1555.88 - 1560.68] P:1878.20 E:0.119348 |  he knows, Harry Kane knows what he's doing, he knows he's the wrong side of Obama-McCarno,
[1560.68 - 1565.48] P:1833.80 E:0.108772 |  he knows that the McCarno's gone to play the ball and he knows that he's in the penalty area,
[1565.48 - 1576.12] P:1963.74 E:0.113600 |  here's the whistle and it's play on, it's not a penalty, well, working that out, the only suggestion
[1576.20 - 1581.80] P:1880.38 E:0.101675 |  I can come up with is that it wasn't in the penalty area, therefore there isn't a decision to be made
[1581.80 - 1588.52] P:1837.61 E:0.098953 |  on whether it was a penalty or not, but Kane fell in the area, it looked like from where we are,
[1589.16 - 1596.20] P:1688.95 E:0.097294 |  there's certainly contact in and around the area, we've seen what, one replay of it from an angle,
[1596.84 - 1602.84] P:1762.23 E:0.098400 |  so it's not looking down the line a little bit like the Japanese ball with the cross etc etc,
[1602.84 - 1607.24] P:1797.40 E:0.103373 |  when Kane fell sprawling into the penalty area, it did look as though it was on the line,
[1607.24 - 1615.96] P:1906.33 E:0.098026 |  maybe slightly over, but no penalty, well that is a controversial moment, we'll let you know if we
[1615.96 - 1621.88] P:1807.09 E:0.097554 |  do get a chance to see that again from a better angle, but it remains England-Nill, France-1,
[1621.88 - 1626.92] P:1651.24 E:0.106351 |  but again Kane pausing problems against Obama-McCarno, yeah that's twice now and Harry Kane fancies it
[1626.92 - 1631.88] P:1711.29 E:0.105727 |  against Obama-McCarno, Obama-McCarno doesn't know when to go, when to come back, when to hold,
[1633.64 - 1640.44] P:1732.46 E:0.103761 |  it's one that certainly Harry Kane really licking his lips on, but what we do know is that it must
[1640.44 - 1646.44] P:1784.01 E:0.101719 |  have been a close call because that took a long time, by FIFA standards that took a long time to rule
[1646.44 - 1655.00] P:1851.31 E:0.101384 |  upon, so France play a long ball for it from the far side, the right hand side from Kunde,
[1655.00 - 1660.52] P:1823.45 E:0.105168 |  but way beyond anyone in a blue shirt, almost half an hour played and France have the edge,
[1661.32 - 1668.76] P:1886.79 E:0.117263 |  the two times winners of the World Cup, 1998 and of course in Moscow, back in 2018,
[1668.76 - 1678.44] P:1822.34 E:0.094789 |  three times finalists, England looking to follow up what they did in the World Cup four years ago
[1678.44 - 1684.92] P:1679.24 E:0.097245 |  and then of course reaching the final last year at the Euros, Maguire carrying it, but towards the
[1684.92 - 1690.04] P:1765.70 E:0.092587 |  halfway line and then a right-footed ball, Henderson is out here, Henderson gets a touch,
[1690.12 - 1695.32] P:1877.73 E:0.099889 |  the ball runs to Saka who tries to win a throw in which succeeds in doing against
[1695.32 - 1700.60] P:1949.13 E:0.110015 |  Fernandez, but then the throw is cut out by Rabiol, but given back to Saka and Saka now
[1700.60 - 1705.24] P:1946.86 E:0.110616 |  up to the edge of the box uses Henderson, Henderson slips the ball in between the legs of Fernandez,
[1705.24 - 1709.56] P:1932.26 E:0.110217 |  but Obama-McCarno is there, clears it, straight to England though, straight to Walker,
[1709.56 - 1715.00] P:1953.05 E:0.111398 |  Jekyll and Rice on his right foot thought about the shot, gives it to Harry Kane who shoots
[1715.00 - 1720.44] P:1980.03 E:0.116993 |  and that needed a good save from Loris who is left, got a good sight on it, but again,
[1720.44 - 1727.40] P:1923.64 E:0.118612 |  Loris denies Kane, fantastic strike from Harry Kane, little work deflection on that which made
[1727.40 - 1734.60] P:1864.96 E:0.119057 |  Loris adjust, maybe he'd have to work his feet, adjust in midair, kinked his body almost to make
[1734.60 - 1741.08] P:1912.57 E:0.096720 |  that save, corner then for England, this is England's first corner of this quarter final,
[1741.40 - 1742.92] P:1791.75 E:0.081502 |  France
[1746.04 - 1750.04] P:1756.34 E:0.111441 |  put two men on England and this is almost like a carbon copy of what we saw when
[1750.04 - 1755.88] P:1791.63 E:0.097947 |  France had their corner at the other end, so two England players, one in front of the other,
[1755.88 - 1760.84] P:1827.24 E:0.098712 |  Kane and Maguire, the two Harrys are there, two Frenchmen just next to the penalty spot,
[1760.84 - 1765.64] P:1897.94 E:0.107435 |  to pack six yard box, Cordon with the delivery, it's flicked across the penalty area, advances down,
[1765.72 - 1772.44] P:1973.95 E:0.114519 |  scorn the six yard box and it's scrambled away by France, Rabiot was able to pounce on the ball
[1773.16 - 1777.80] P:1911.28 E:0.112022 |  and the French were fortunate there, there was no one in a white shirt, good delivery from Cordon,
[1779.08 - 1784.36] P:1762.26 E:0.108616 |  I think schoolboy stuff almost there, an absolute bundle on the ball, just anybody just putting
[1784.36 - 1789.32] P:1804.15 E:0.107039 |  something on the line just to get in the way from France, those problems, Dalligan now to the right
[1789.32 - 1795.48] P:1826.60 E:0.109628 |  hand side, yes Henderson, Henderson, turns, gives it back to Walker on the halfway line,
[1796.04 - 1800.68] P:1715.51 E:0.113707 |  he hit that shot Harry Kane, probably 25 yards giving the angle on the right hand side,
[1801.24 - 1806.20] P:1818.88 E:0.116374 |  but Laurie's diving was there, parrying it away, so that's two saves for Laurie's against Kane
[1807.00 - 1810.92] P:1920.61 E:0.118373 |  and then Dalligan, I don't think England will get that free kick, but Dalligan wants near the edge
[1810.92 - 1817.08] P:1842.43 E:0.108042 |  of the box, Saka, that might have been a foul, ball bounces away in behind and the assistant
[1817.08 - 1821.72] P:1828.20 E:0.105005 |  is not giving a decision, so both sets of players down there are retealing and the referee says it's
[1821.72 - 1827.48] P:1709.48 E:0.100916 |  a goal kick, Saka still talking about it, that's what the whistle is for that you can hear, the
[1827.48 - 1832.52] P:1729.93 E:0.102679 |  referee saying to Bukajosaka, come on come away, the goal kick France, but it's been a good response
[1832.52 - 1836.20] P:1703.51 E:0.104262 |  from England, you have to say that they were rocked by that goal and they weren't coming up with
[1836.20 - 1840.44] P:1668.66 E:0.104294 |  answers, it's been really positive since then, been on the front but been asking the questions,
[1841.16 - 1844.84] P:1683.94 E:0.112272 |  we've seen a replay of the goal, we certainly haven't seen a replay of the penalty incident,
[1847.64 - 1853.16] P:1609.49 E:0.107327 |  so England nil, France won, hopefully we'll get to see it at some stage, you would like to think
[1853.80 - 1857.64] P:1776.21 E:0.110037 |  as it bounces out of play for a throw into England half inside their own half,
[1858.68 - 1864.12] P:1556.93 E:0.105634 |  so England behind, it really hasn't happened very often at tournament Sunday Gareth Southgate,
[1864.12 - 1869.72] P:1621.48 E:0.102947 |  remember the semi-final against Denmark, when the Dames scored the first goal that England had
[1869.72 - 1875.72] P:1723.74 E:0.101808 |  conceded at the Euros last year and England eventually turned it around in extra time,
[1876.28 - 1883.24] P:1677.10 E:0.104036 |  a fortunate penalty in extra time to win it, even themselves out in the end, it's taken a couple
[1883.24 - 1889.88] P:1691.41 E:0.098659 |  of years, throwing for England, Bellingham, Rabiot is able to take it down, but it has been a good
[1889.88 - 1895.16] P:1699.19 E:0.101650 |  response to going a goal down, you know that's a shell shock in a match like this, on occasion like
[1895.16 - 1901.00] P:1755.40 E:0.095050 |  this, as Loris plays it forward, but you're on a tightrope aren't you, one nil down,
[1901.96 - 1908.84] P:1722.59 E:0.103910 |  Kane Winkser, Shugged over by Rabiot, 10 yards inside his own half, you're on a tightrope,
[1908.84 - 1913.24] P:1708.34 E:0.094972 |  one nil down against France with the attacking Callans that they have and the damage that they
[1913.24 - 1917.00] P:1760.43 E:0.104655 |  can do is England push forward and what they can do on the break, absolutely, but they're doing it
[1917.00 - 1920.92] P:1599.01 E:0.099979 |  in the right way I think and they're forcing Loris to kick long, they have hardly played out from
[1920.92 - 1925.40] P:1503.69 E:0.094945 |  the back really France and you're looking for England, where can we cut the supply off, certainly
[1925.40 - 1930.04] P:1609.27 E:0.102280 |  in Bafail, Dembale don't want to get me going ahead in the ball, so we've got Ryse McGuire,
[1930.04 - 1936.20] P:1682.86 E:0.105836 |  Stones there for that, they'll fancy them, over half an hour played, 33 minutes at
[1936.20 - 1941.56] P:1720.59 E:0.106486 |  straight on the clock and England go back to Stones in central defence,
[1944.12 - 1947.72] P:1720.72 E:0.110488 |  Stones carrying it forward into the centre circle and passing it short to Gallingham,
[1947.72 - 1953.24] P:1896.14 E:0.111268 |  Orl who's giving it away to Mbappe and Mbappe moves away out towards the left hand side,
[1953.24 - 1959.32] P:1950.20 E:0.111060 |  Walker is there, he takes on Walker who has a success against Mbappe, block me attempt
[1959.32 - 1963.40] P:1955.52 E:0.116603 |  the ball, he was looking a slippy pass then, Walker blocked it and then there's a foul on Saka
[1964.04 - 1969.88] P:1728.38 E:0.102250 |  and England have a free kick, yeah, did well, between them Saka and Walker, particularly Walker
[1969.88 - 1975.40] P:1803.42 E:0.098075 |  holds his hand up for Bellingham immediately, there's a pull back with ball, Thornton Hart was
[1975.40 - 1980.52] P:1551.63 E:0.097860 |  in your mouth for a moment there from an English perspective, but Carl Walker was calm, composed,
[1980.52 - 1985.40] P:1635.43 E:0.095459 |  ready well, England got away with two mistakes now centre field, Henderson early on in the match,
[1985.40 - 1990.68] P:1550.38 E:0.090054 |  Jude Dallingham there, you wouldn't like to see England make another mistake like that,
[1990.68 - 1994.84] P:1709.93 E:0.101000 |  there's only so many you feel you can make like that, Maguire with that long pass out
[1994.84 - 1998.84] P:1776.40 E:0.096141 |  towards the right hand side looking for Saka, but it's headed away by Hernandez, Henderson now,
[1998.84 - 2006.36] P:1864.57 E:0.092157 |  Henderson in field towards Dukaio Saka, Saka back to Henderson, then to Saka again, Saka goes away
[2006.36 - 2011.24] P:1988.42 E:0.113763 |  from Ravio into the penalty area still going and then Hernandez puts in the challenge, referee was
[2011.24 - 2016.04] P:1940.74 E:0.104696 |  right there three four yards away, immediately pointed and said that Hernandez had got the ball
[2016.04 - 2020.84] P:1865.99 E:0.100574 |  in that challenge with Saka, so Jiru now over the halfway line, here's Dembele on the right hand
[2020.84 - 2026.76] P:1692.91 E:0.096293 |  side, Luke Shaw has gone with him, Thornton is now coming back to help Shaw and that means that he
[2026.76 - 2033.96] P:1739.05 E:0.102476 |  has to go back further to the goal scorer, Turemeini, who I've hardly mentioned his name,
[2034.52 - 2039.24] P:1760.55 E:0.113690 |  well interesting, we've hardly mentioned Griezmann after since saying he was finding the spaces,
[2039.24 - 2043.72] P:1810.76 E:0.101167 |  just there, he held the centre circle, no no no no no, just give me the ball back here,
[2043.72 - 2046.36] P:1784.33 E:0.103593 |  I don't want to make difference right now, I want to control the game.
[2047.32 - 2055.56] P:1742.99 E:0.098582 |  England nail France one for placing the semi-finals against Morocco, as Griezmann will give it back
[2055.56 - 2061.88] P:1741.25 E:0.101818 |  to Verran, Verran just shuffles forward in those orange boots and then a pass from Dembele down
[2061.88 - 2067.72] P:1945.27 E:0.111131 |  the right to Griezmann and Griezmann is not able to get past Garryman, Luke found himself as the
[2067.72 - 2072.60] P:1872.09 E:0.106273 |  recovering man in the left back position and then hits a long left-footed pass up to the
[2072.60 - 2078.28] P:1870.83 E:0.104875 |  halfway line and France will start again in the centre circle, yeah they've recovered that,
[2078.28 - 2085.40] P:1685.51 E:0.106381 |  England had that storm for probably one 10-15 minutes or so but the French now have got more
[2085.40 - 2091.16] P:1795.96 E:0.105034 |  of the ball and more of the possession, Griezmann then in goes right, strong challenge again,
[2091.16 - 2094.44] P:1778.23 E:0.113631 |  this one on the radio and the French have to go all the way back to their goal.
[2094.44 - 2099.16] P:1562.28 E:0.109328 |  But it's better for me that Bellingham has just been a little bit more composed, a little bit more
[2099.16 - 2102.84] P:1473.18 E:0.106471 |  aware in there and looking where Griezmann is and saying right okay that's my role,
[2102.84 - 2104.60] P:1729.03 E:0.098531 |  I'm going to have to be the one to get out to him.
[2107.00 - 2112.68] P:1853.55 E:0.106711 |  The French have got it, the blue, white and red, Griezmann, long left-footed ball
[2112.68 - 2117.16] P:1894.76 E:0.108826 |  out to the left-hand side that is tested down by Hernández, the sack that was back there,
[2117.88 - 2122.36] P:1794.54 E:0.097079 |  I mean you can see the work that has to be done here, the balls teams, yeah there's
[2123.16 - 2128.52] P:1679.62 E:0.102290 |  there's that doubling up, the four players are expected for both teams because of the threats
[2128.52 - 2134.44] P:1759.41 E:0.100731 |  that there are, this time it was Sacher helping out Walker, France, here's Tua Mane, Tua Mane
[2134.44 - 2139.32] P:1608.79 E:0.109135 |  away the two number eights together running away from us so we can see them clearly, those numbers,
[2139.32 - 2144.84] P:1767.52 E:0.103513 |  gold on the back of the blue French shirt and Tua Mane actually plays it with Henderson following
[2144.84 - 2151.48] P:1705.52 E:0.105548 |  him all the way back to goalkeeper, Loris, long and left-footed from him, and comes
[2151.56 - 2157.64] P:1744.31 E:0.112588 |  McGuire with the challenge, ball runs to Fordham, Fordham, there's Prypt by Griezmann, that's a free kick,
[2159.00 - 2162.36] P:1775.90 E:0.113032 |  that's a free kick to England, the other half-way line, yeah they're doing a good job though England
[2162.36 - 2166.36] P:1654.27 E:0.100222 |  again, Loris, they're not messing around, they're not they've had Veran as the spare man at the back,
[2166.36 - 2170.60] P:1626.18 E:0.094923 |  they could easily play it out, they didn't, they went long to Giroud, Rice in front,
[2170.60 - 2177.24] P:1801.56 E:0.095575 |  Stones and McGuire in behind, we'll have that thank you very much, translating 1-0, 17th minute goal
[2177.80 - 2186.84] P:1838.94 E:0.101414 |  from Orlean, Tua Mane, the young king as they call it, clearly got a great great future ahead of him
[2188.04 - 2193.24] P:1741.27 E:0.106051 |  and he's the man who's making the difference between England and France just now, Henderson
[2193.24 - 2198.92] P:1776.88 E:0.103248 |  playing the ball back to McGuire, then out to the left hand side, Shaw kills it for it but that's
[2198.92 - 2205.32] P:1851.51 E:0.099385 |  asking too much of Bellingham, although Veran on the edge of the box just cleared away with Bellingham
[2205.32 - 2211.00] P:1918.90 E:0.110541 |  arriving on the scene, now Walker alone allows the ball to bounce over Shaw's end, just gets up
[2211.00 - 2218.04] P:1923.88 E:0.104262 |  and bolleys it back to Jordan Pickford in the goal, England conceding for the third time at this
[2218.04 - 2223.64] P:1811.70 E:0.100128 |  tournament, two goals against Erran but that one there, super strike really, we've seen some
[2224.20 - 2228.76] P:1823.44 E:0.111664 |  really outstanding goals haven't we in the knockout stages and indeed throughout the course
[2228.84 - 2237.08] P:1914.56 E:0.105909 |  of this World Cup, Stones back to the left hand side to McGuire, Shaw's available out on the left
[2237.08 - 2240.92] P:1873.76 E:0.110774 |  but McGuire's going to look for that long pass again to Henderson, that's asking a lot of the Liverpool
[2240.92 - 2246.04] P:1907.67 E:0.104116 |  captain, he won't reach that, skidded off the turf and into the advertising hoardings, you've probably
[2246.04 - 2251.72] P:1814.66 E:0.102413 |  heard the splat as it did so, so a throw into France, yeah it's on though, it's on because outside, out there
[2252.28 - 2257.96] P:1720.67 E:0.102534 |  John Henderson's pulling very wide, Sackers coming inside, that combination, that pair and have had
[2257.96 - 2262.52] P:1795.57 E:0.105538 |  joy down this right hand side, combining along with Harry Kane, that's where the chances have come from
[2265.16 - 2271.88] P:1849.09 E:0.106902 |  so a throw in to France, I said in my preview this morning, you know talking about the milestones
[2271.88 - 2278.60] P:1971.20 E:0.102263 |  that the two goalkeepers would reach this evening, one or the other could keep a clean sheet tonight,
[2278.60 - 2283.80] P:2000.26 E:0.112006 |  they might well be on the winning team and at the moment that would be Hugo Loris
[2284.60 - 2290.12] P:1954.11 E:0.106957 |  and Bapé with a run forward but he has his heels clipped, goes down, that's a free kick, just caught there,
[2290.12 - 2295.32] P:1928.55 E:0.099880 |  little foul by Jordan Henderson but a free kick in the middle of the England half towards the left hand
[2295.32 - 2301.56] P:1918.90 E:0.094245 |  side, set peace chance for France, you look at Karl Walker and the relative success that he's had so far
[2301.56 - 2306.84] P:1923.30 E:0.088921 |  off against Gillian and Bapé, yes you don't want him running up against him but you've got to
[2306.84 - 2312.12] P:1913.02 E:0.097271 |  pack your man, you pack your man to defend England holding their line outside the penalty area,
[2312.76 - 2319.00] P:1932.30 E:0.098728 |  Griezmann, he can be brilliant with these deliverings from this sort of area, Griezmann
[2319.64 - 2325.16] P:1928.67 E:0.105569 |  winning his 115th cap tonight, Griezmann actually plays it short, it's flicked into the penalty area
[2325.16 - 2331.56] P:1959.00 E:0.107410 |  on the left hand side and then Hernandez works it across, Arland, Bapé is underneath that but it bounced up,
[2332.36 - 2338.92] P:1927.73 E:0.091371 |  he snatched at it rather, the great man and lifted it high over the crossbar from 12-13 yards,
[2338.92 - 2343.80] P:1779.00 E:0.100146 |  it was awkward, it was clever initially, have a couple of passes to get it to
[2343.80 - 2351.08] P:1835.09 E:0.098205 |  Téhanan, there's an hit well just to cut it back and then from there you are heart and mouth moment
[2351.80 - 2362.28] P:1937.06 E:0.083357 |  as it comes to him, then a good 20 rows back, England nil, France won, five lives and BBC
[2362.28 - 2370.44] P:1852.09 E:0.091847 |  sounds and across Africa on the World Service, at the moment it would be France, Morocco which would be
[2371.24 - 2377.16] P:1917.27 E:0.099938 |  extraordinary event as the ball is played to the left hand, to the right hand side by Saca, Saca
[2377.16 - 2382.12] P:1877.90 E:0.097846 |  juggles the ball and then gets it down on the playing surface, Saca infield to Folden,
[2384.12 - 2390.12] P:1917.30 E:0.094265 |  now John Stones halfway inside the French half, gives it to his Manchester City team,
[2390.28 - 2396.84] P:1914.83 E:0.101338 |  now he has Henderson on that flank as well, he's appeared for the time being on the right,
[2396.84 - 2401.96] P:1899.85 E:0.100324 |  Henderson rolls the ball into the penalty area to Bellingham and then Bellingham angles it back
[2401.96 - 2406.76] P:1957.28 E:0.110756 |  to Saca and then Saca curls it in, looking for that ball to the back post which is headed away
[2406.76 - 2414.60] P:1956.03 E:0.100296 |  defensively, Kunde was able to come across and get up in front of Harry Kane and make the clearance
[2415.32 - 2420.12] P:1912.20 E:0.110289 |  clear of the way downfield, a little bit of a stretch there for Rice but there was a foul by
[2420.12 - 2425.00] P:1895.22 E:0.108804 |  Dan Ballet on the West Ham captain and it's a free kick to England 10 yards inside the
[2425.00 - 2430.20] P:1847.30 E:0.103077 |  row, Rob Green. Yeah it's just it's good possession for England in writing around the French penalty
[2430.20 - 2435.88] P:1886.59 E:0.095981 |  area but just feeling that they're a man short in the combination so just need another man in there
[2435.88 - 2441.64] P:1905.72 E:0.090309 |  to combine, to finish off a pass, to finish off a move, it's just not quite there yet.
[2442.60 - 2447.96] P:1877.89 E:0.099759 |  Thornton sending it through the middle Bellingham back towards Rice again,
[2449.80 - 2456.04] P:1865.03 E:0.104433 |  so England in centrefield, Declan Wright just opens his palms and then plays it through to Thornton
[2456.04 - 2461.40] P:1877.41 E:0.098774 |  but as the challenge came in it ran away from him, France have got it back, Greensman and then
[2461.40 - 2466.60] P:1861.00 E:0.102725 |  Gippa McConaugh back to Greensman again but comes Kunde from the right back position,
[2466.60 - 2472.04] P:1860.13 E:0.099376 |  we've not seen too much of him pushing forward Kunde but he is now advancing in the forward
[2472.04 - 2479.40] P:1889.32 E:0.097435 |  position, Dembele then plays it back to Rabiot and then we'll all through the middle to run back
[2479.40 - 2487.00] P:1875.86 E:0.092422 |  there and then back into the centre circle, halftime less than four minutes away, big team
[2487.00 - 2492.12] P:1858.64 E:0.103331 |  talk coming for Gareth Southgate and it stays like this, Greensman to the right hand side,
[2492.12 - 2495.32] P:1862.47 E:0.109661 |  Dembele again dangerously onto his left foot but England are wise to that,
[2495.32 - 2498.84] P:1953.34 E:0.110985 |  Bellingham comes across and blocks it out, just rolled down the right hand side,
[2498.84 - 2505.88] P:1870.21 E:0.091767 |  ten yards back from the corner flag, it's taken quickly to Dembele, Dembele rolls it in field,
[2505.88 - 2512.12] P:1875.74 E:0.099036 |  Trumani is there, confident flick back centrally to Gippa McConaugh who swings a right footed pass to
[2512.12 - 2518.84] P:1899.92 E:0.105067 |  the left hand side, Hernandez, now Rabiot, Rabiot with Saka in front of him, Bame takes a touch
[2518.84 - 2524.20] P:2000.88 E:0.117696 |  as John Stones comes in, the ball runs out of play and Bame went sprawling down, now he's on
[2524.44 - 2528.92] P:1928.43 E:0.117192 |  his knees off the field suggesting that the referee got a push from John Stones, referee not
[2528.92 - 2533.56] P:1917.31 E:0.103851 |  interested throwing England, good decision not enough in that looking for it, went down easy,
[2535.56 - 2541.24] P:1955.51 E:0.116014 |  well I hope we'll be able to see a better view of the England penalty appeal at halftime and there's
[2541.24 - 2546.76] P:2002.16 E:0.118303 |  the yellow card the first one for a trip on Kyle Walker as he was bringing the ball forward
[2547.32 - 2552.68] P:1934.82 E:0.100544 |  and it is, Greensman who is yellow carded for that, not his first foul, no knew what he was doing,
[2552.68 - 2556.04] P:1846.00 E:0.100954 |  Walker was away through the minutes driving into the centre of the pitch and
[2557.24 - 2563.96] P:1804.81 E:0.102810 |  see it so often just that deliberate trip but I would say he's been an absolute joy to watch
[2563.96 - 2568.52] P:1833.73 E:0.105744 |  Greensman so far, he has been the difference between the two teams, he's hated the play when
[2568.52 - 2577.32] P:1904.28 E:0.077324 |  France have had it, yeah super player as we know and even though he's not yet got under the
[2577.32 - 2584.36] P:1816.38 E:0.095952 |  score sheet at this World Cup he's been such an important part, Greensman of what Didier Deschamps
[2584.36 - 2589.16] P:1700.57 E:0.101049 |  side of done so far at this tournament and the moment the World Champions are on course to return
[2589.80 - 2594.84] P:1903.71 E:0.113486 |  to the semi-final this time, Declan Rice does well, gets away but he comes to the sliding challenge,
[2594.84 - 2600.84] P:1956.06 E:0.109075 |  it was Dembele who put that in on Declan Rice, 30 yards from the French goal and he's back up on
[2600.84 - 2604.76] P:1940.89 E:0.110266 |  his feet and he's bringing the ball forward Dembele and Bellingham puts in the challenge but
[2604.76 - 2610.68] P:1918.79 E:0.097734 |  Dembele keeps his feet, centrally is now and then rolls it back to Tune in, he was just behind
[2610.68 - 2617.32] P:1875.16 E:0.091449 |  the ravioli there as well with that hair tied back behind his head and now Kundé on the right flank
[2618.28 - 2626.36] P:1887.74 E:0.108923 |  France just knocking it around inside the England half, Bapu is now drifted inside playing also,
[2626.36 - 2631.00] P:1840.77 E:0.115533 |  well he is a second centre forward alongside Olivier Giroud, I think he's feeling a little bit
[2631.24 - 2639.48] P:1827.00 E:0.111578 |  left out on that left-hand side and England have handled him well in the main, he's not been the
[2639.48 - 2652.12] P:1936.01 E:0.096999 |  problem, the problem is England are losing, Saka to Walker and then Rice, Cross it goes to Bellingham,
[2652.68 - 2660.12] P:1904.57 E:0.107073 |  how do they, to the left flank again, Shaw is there, so Bellingham makes that run, he just so well
[2660.20 - 2665.08] P:1890.19 E:0.109572 |  find the space, Bellingham takes on his man, left for the ball into the penalty area, that's cleared
[2665.08 - 2670.68] P:1954.85 E:0.105906 |  away by Varan, back out to where it came from, headed forward by Kundé, flicked forward by Griezmann,
[2670.68 - 2676.44] P:1916.67 E:0.098394 |  the French supporters down in that corner of the ground, enjoyed that, a big French cheer went up
[2676.44 - 2681.32] P:1924.81 E:0.108000 |  for that, they've got their their tricklers, their French tricklers, they're twirling them around
[2681.32 - 2687.48] P:1972.69 E:0.108681 |  as France come forward over the halfway line, I mean when cut out that attack and then K.H.T. is up
[2688.20 - 2694.60] P:1955.49 E:0.104718 |  with the McCarno, saw his chance there, Kain took a touch and having come out second against Harry
[2694.60 - 2699.16] P:1866.71 E:0.098378 |  Kain and at least have a couple of occasions, in he went there and put in the challenge out for a
[2699.16 - 2703.64] P:1800.29 E:0.099900 |  throw, he's tried to nick a couple and failed, he wasn't going to miss that one and it wasn't a nick,
[2704.44 - 2711.96] P:1822.35 E:0.104541 |  it was not, Kain shrugged it off and was up on his feet very quickly, so we'll have four minutes
[2711.96 - 2718.04] P:1735.49 E:0.103030 |  about a time at the end of this first half, France leading through the 17th minute goal,
[2719.64 - 2726.84] P:1795.81 E:0.094207 |  Henderson back to to John Sturms, he gives it to McGuire, who's right over there on the left
[2726.84 - 2731.32] P:1887.38 E:0.089729 |  hand side, Guire has a look forward and he's going for that pass again, the crossfield pass
[2731.96 - 2738.68] P:1930.77 E:0.101599 |  back there, who is stationary as he controlled it on his left instep, Henderson makes the overlapping
[2738.76 - 2745.88] P:1992.16 E:0.107641 |  run, France have got three men there but Sackle rolls it infield and Walker arrives and now Kain
[2747.32 - 2752.44] P:1836.76 E:0.105801 |  under pressure from up on McCarno back to Sackle, he finds Kain but is back to the penalty area
[2752.44 - 2757.40] P:1889.76 E:0.107235 |  and England go back and then Kain goes down again up on McCarno suggesting there was nothing in that
[2757.96 - 2762.52] P:1970.04 E:0.104462 |  but it was long after the ball had gone, now Sackle centrally trying to find a way through but
[2762.52 - 2768.60] P:1988.19 E:0.108535 |  no he can't do that, too congested, France bring the ball away, Touemene, Touembappe,
[2769.40 - 2774.68] P:1940.79 E:0.100484 |  Walker just stands off him, Bellingham arrives to help out the England right back, now Griezmann
[2774.68 - 2779.40] P:1874.49 E:0.091993 |  that might have been afoul by Sackle on Touemene but France have still got it out to the right
[2779.40 - 2784.20] P:1792.34 E:0.092380 |  hand side it goes, Griezmann is there with his bleach-blonde hair, Griezmann turns and just gives
[2784.20 - 2790.36] P:1879.11 E:0.104867 |  it back behind him, had almost two minutes of the thought to be added on at the end of this first half
[2792.52 - 2796.52] P:1850.43 E:0.118711 |  Griezmann just there on the ball, he's like he's playing in the park, he just did a little twirl
[2796.52 - 2800.52] P:1902.59 E:0.115331 |  on the ball in the centre of the pitch, he's playing without a care in the world, he's wandered
[2800.52 - 2807.32] P:1887.91 E:0.120359 |  around at times but it's so clever what he's doing, the pockets he's picking up, the spaces he's finding
[2811.24 - 2817.24] P:1834.43 E:0.119462 |  France very happily take this score line at the break, one goal
[2818.20 - 2824.68] P:1937.46 E:0.104026 |  and in fact they go and take it all the way back into their own half, Gouppermakano
[2824.68 - 2830.20] P:1901.11 E:0.103240 |  they hit a long pass that Walker will just turn around to run behind and it will be a goal kick
[2830.76 - 2837.88] P:1949.70 E:0.098073 |  for England, take this quickly which he does into the third minute of added time,
[2839.08 - 2846.12] P:1904.25 E:0.107391 |  Maguire carrying the ball forward, just knocks it to his right, just thought about the long ball,
[2846.12 - 2849.48] P:1848.36 E:0.103209 |  Kane is through the middle in between the two central defenders moment at England
[2849.48 - 2853.96] P:1835.56 E:0.098930 |  still with the ball inside their own half, Bellingham goes down, that was off the ball,
[2853.96 - 2859.40] P:1793.96 E:0.097789 |  Saka has it, so England go back again, 90 seconds of the first half to play,
[2860.12 - 2866.76] P:1779.38 E:0.100251 |  stones to Maguire on the left hand side, Floodan makes a run for it, Shaw gives it back to Maguire
[2868.28 - 2873.72] P:1908.65 E:0.114229 |  and then it's a long pass from Shaw, that's asking a lot, it might have come off Pounday,
[2873.72 - 2877.88] P:1975.18 E:0.118771 |  the two of them went together, it gave it to England's corner right at the end of the first half,
[2879.24 - 2884.52] P:1803.34 E:0.117209 |  England have stayed in the game, without the better you'd say after France have scored,
[2886.12 - 2891.00] P:1862.45 E:0.117688 |  won't be this two, this aren't even if they don't score, but fantastic opportunity at the end.
[2894.12 - 2899.16] P:1906.39 E:0.113394 |  So looking down to our right, England this time for this corner which is only that second of the
[2899.96 - 2904.52] P:1928.94 E:0.109060 |  match, there are now four or five England players, so all of the England players in the penalty area
[2904.52 - 2910.36] P:1950.78 E:0.108020 |  are doing the bus queue routine and whatever you like to call it, three, four, five of them lining
[2910.36 - 2914.60] P:1980.87 E:0.101689 |  up one behind the other, the French defenders are there, here's Floodan's delivery, Maguire's
[2914.60 - 2919.08] P:1991.58 E:0.099426 |  underneath it but it's over Maguire and it bounces out to the right hand side, 30 seconds of the
[2919.08 - 2924.36] P:1963.37 E:0.096532 |  first half to play, Bellingham's ball back in is miss hit and that gives France the chance to come
[2924.36 - 2928.68] P:1951.54 E:0.108087 |  out with it but then Bellingham in with a challenge, over McCarno first time on the edge of the box,
[2928.76 - 2935.32] P:1929.39 E:0.113535 |  slices it away, the referee stopped play because Hernandez I think it is has come off
[2935.32 - 2943.64] P:1924.38 E:0.099705 |  worst in that challenge and so the referee has stopped playing, in England are saying
[2944.28 - 2949.16] P:1947.70 E:0.102530 |  well it's not a head injury, why do you stop play? No it looked awkward, it looked like
[2950.44 - 2955.00] P:1858.73 E:0.101870 |  not a clumsy challenge from Duke Bellingham but he won the ball but it's full blooded and it's
[2955.64 - 2960.52] P:1856.24 E:0.091127 |  he's dropped to his knees as he's got into the challenge, he's almost out of control but
[2960.52 - 2966.04] P:1937.84 E:0.096103 |  won the ball, he was a good corner from England, Harry Maguire was free, it's a good routine,
[2966.04 - 2971.48] P:1948.05 E:0.107467 |  just slightly over hit, Hernandez is back on his feet, play is going to resume with a dropped ball
[2972.36 - 2978.68] P:1949.20 E:0.096281 |  and I think that'll be it at the end of the first half, we've already had 30 seconds over the
[2978.68 - 2985.48] P:1856.22 E:0.094043 |  four minutes of added time, England nil, France won, really not too many chances in the match,
[2986.36 - 2991.24] P:1860.25 E:0.101868 |  beautifully taken goal by Tuanani in the 17th minute, Girere had his header before that,
[2991.24 - 2997.88] P:1833.30 E:0.110361 |  Bappe had that one chance really and England's opportunities have been better and there is
[2997.88 - 3003.08] P:1980.23 E:0.115494 |  the halftime whistle, Hugo Loris has made two important saves, England thought they should
[3003.08 - 3009.00] P:1909.94 E:0.105196 |  have had a penalty, there was a long DAR look at it, that was when England shortly after England
[3009.00 - 3018.60] P:1640.31 E:0.095099 |  had taken the lead but the DAR decision was no penalty and so that Tuanani goal means that
[3018.60 - 3025.56] P:1516.66 E:0.093388 |  France, the champions had the edge at halftime, still England players, Harry Maguire, Foden,
[3025.56 - 3029.80] P:1740.97 E:0.097118 |  Bellingham as well are talking to the officials as they now head towards the dressing rooms, Rob Green.
[3030.36 - 3035.24] P:1766.74 E:0.095603 |  Well, signs of good teams, they score when they're on top and France scored when they were on top,
[3035.24 - 3041.48] P:1733.09 E:0.085480 |  they scored a wonder goal, wonder strike, England had their time on top, created a couple of chances,
[3041.48 - 3047.32] P:1813.85 E:0.080549 |  didn't score and that's the difference really so far, it's on a knife edge but France have just
[3047.32 - 3052.36] P:1848.32 E:0.092784 |  had that moment of quality when they were on top. England are going to reach semi-finals at
[3052.36 - 3056.52] P:1930.15 E:0.092235 |  consecutive World Cups, they're going to have to do it from behind at halftime, England nil,
[3057.08 - 3061.48] P:1899.41 E:0.092180 |  France won is the score and Mark Chapman is here with us inside the Albaid Stadium.
[3061.48 - 3065.16] P:1626.50 E:0.099818 |  England have had more attempts at goal, Rob Green have had more possession,
[3065.16 - 3070.12] P:1774.33 E:0.087669 |  they're frustrated at the end, they need to channel that frustration.
[3070.76 - 3075.00] P:1693.46 E:0.098290 |  Yep, but also not this hard, I think they'd be encouraged, they can get into the game and you
[3075.00 - 3079.16] P:1693.32 E:0.095117 |  look at the way that they've gone about it and at times have managed to win the ball back,
[3079.16 - 3084.04] P:1770.03 E:0.090856 |  I think that's the key thing, win the ball back high and then go again and recycle the ball is
[3084.04 - 3089.40] P:1817.16 E:0.078439 |  their modern parlance but from there I think they've got more in the tank than France,
[3089.40 - 3094.36] P:1923.67 E:0.089390 |  they've got more to stay in the game, they've got a score whilst we're in it and on top.
[3095.56 - 3099.32] P:1710.39 E:0.084301 |  In the main Antoine Griezmann's killing England, isn't he?
[3100.04 - 3106.52] P:1857.46 E:0.094908 |  Oh he's been an absolute pleasure to watch Griezmann, he's so clever, what he's doing is dropping
[3106.52 - 3112.52] P:1805.32 E:0.093144 |  real deep to receive the ball, playing a one-touch pass into a defender or another midfielder
[3113.16 - 3119.08] P:1744.68 E:0.090558 |  and then making that run behind Bellingham, forcing Bellingham out on that left-hand side
[3119.08 - 3123.56] P:1795.57 E:0.091713 |  and he doesn't know whether to stay or go, does Bellingham and he's controlling the pace,
[3123.56 - 3127.80] P:1735.05 E:0.084582 |  there was a moment in the game there when normally we'd ask for the ball, he was like no,
[3127.80 - 3131.88] P:1551.12 E:0.089693 |  calm, let me get into the position where I want to receive it to her England and he's been the
[3131.88 - 3138.92] P:1710.93 E:0.084564 |  best player on the pitch by far. The inside right channels or the right channel is actually
[3138.92 - 3144.20] P:1539.25 E:0.095322 |  where both sides are probably getting the most joy actually because England's most amount of joy
[3144.20 - 3151.48] P:1597.19 E:0.090275 |  comes from Saka and Kane maybe drifting over more this one. What's really happening is Saka's
[3151.48 - 3158.84] P:1565.33 E:0.093704 |  staying really wide, Kane coming deep which is being effective and what Kyle Walker has noticed
[3158.84 - 3166.04] P:1562.12 E:0.085126 |  that when he's got an opportunity to go and Bap is not coming with him and on one occasion it's
[3166.12 - 3173.16] P:1519.40 E:0.093808 |  positive if you get the outcome of a goal or an assist but unfortunately him being up the field
[3173.16 - 3179.32] P:1581.31 E:0.092855 |  then trying to get back it forced three players around and Bap and what do we say where's the
[3179.32 - 3183.64] P:1465.69 E:0.089345 |  space going to be, he's going to be on the other side, ball goes over to the side and it's a
[3183.64 - 3189.00] P:1552.17 E:0.099901 |  Griezmann who gets the assist for two of many and this is such an intriguing game, tactical battle
[3189.00 - 3194.52] P:1449.06 E:0.094077 |  has been brilliant but I think England actually have been excellent, you know Kane had a couple
[3194.60 - 3200.20] P:1601.51 E:0.095266 |  of chances on another day against Leriz, he sticks that away, they could have had a penalty
[3200.20 - 3204.36] P:1614.56 E:0.099103 |  so they'll go into the halftime with their heads held high, they just need to make sure
[3204.36 - 3208.84] P:1690.81 E:0.085959 |  they finish some challenges in the second half. We've only seen one replay, I have to say to the
[3208.84 - 3213.80] P:1639.78 E:0.088401 |  naked eye it looked like the challenge on Kane was outside the box which I'm guessing is why the
[3213.80 - 3217.96] P:1639.56 E:0.091886 |  referee wasn't sent to the monitor to agide on it because it must have been outside the box and
[3217.96 - 3221.96] P:1685.27 E:0.087510 |  they are judged on that. There are some suggestions there might have been a foul on Saka in the
[3221.96 - 3227.40] P:1666.97 E:0.090960 |  build-up to the French goal but I mean that was way back in the move, it's a gilet en aron back with
[3227.40 - 3233.88] P:1689.66 E:0.087323 |  us, it's a fascinating game of chicken in many ways, it's England press press and if England
[3233.88 - 3240.04] P:1669.94 E:0.081686 |  go for the press and France beat it from their own defensive line with England high up then
[3240.04 - 3244.36] P:1687.23 E:0.092072 |  that's where France are then going to cause the dangers. Yeah you're right I think everything
[3244.36 - 3248.20] P:1798.67 E:0.108829 |  we expected really that we mentioned in the build-up the role for Griezmann who,
[3248.92 - 3253.56] P:1814.17 E:0.101913 |  Michael is right, I've been outstanding really the player of this game, the way he's controlled,
[3253.56 - 3258.52] P:1680.81 E:0.094006 |  the way he finds that space and then you're right on the penalty that Rob was saying recovered the
[3258.52 - 3264.36] P:1848.20 E:0.091798 |  ball high because it's a high recovery on that penalty shout and England have to do that more,
[3264.36 - 3267.96] P:1957.08 E:0.099142 |  you can still put Theo on the pressure, you can put Kunde on the more pressure even than that,
[3267.96 - 3274.28] P:1822.75 E:0.085642 |  you can put Chouamini on the more pressure where I thought France was at times quite comfortable
[3274.28 - 3279.32] P:1971.65 E:0.096421 |  is that clearly Chouamini is on Bellingham, clearly Rabiot is on Henderson and either Giroud
[3279.32 - 3283.80] P:1944.11 E:0.093939 |  or Griezmann follows Reiss which means I think for them has to come inside to create a bit more
[3283.80 - 3287.80] P:1892.86 E:0.099663 |  trouble in this French side because right now when the game is in front of them when Maguire
[3287.80 - 3291.80] P:1832.94 E:0.097749 |  or Stone have the ball or Reiss drops it's a bit too easy, it's a bit too predictable.
[3291.80 - 3297.32] P:1781.49 E:0.091006 |  And that's what I thought I said maybe Rob the last 10-15 minutes I mean we saw Foden over here
[3297.32 - 3303.72] P:1896.06 E:0.092333 |  on the right at one stage I wonder whether they got word out try and go in those half spaces between
[3303.72 - 3309.24] P:1664.58 E:0.092369 |  you know inside a little bit and see what what trouble you could cause and maybe Bellingham as well.
[3309.24 - 3312.84] P:1749.09 E:0.094257 |  Yeah what are you looking at the switch and Harrogua has done the switch a lot which is great
[3312.84 - 3317.00] P:1691.90 E:0.094735 |  and find it if you find your man but then that man's isolated on his own because he's such a
[3317.00 - 3322.12] P:1713.49 E:0.089049 |  long way from his own players so you need to get the players over us in the commentary saying
[3322.12 - 3326.84] P:1803.89 E:0.088220 |  we're a player short at the moment in the build up in the combinations and that's what we're trying
[3326.84 - 3332.36] P:1768.40 E:0.086080 |  to do allow Phil Foden to come and wall the way across because yeah sackers going wide sackers
[3332.36 - 3336.28] P:1795.30 E:0.091669 |  fine enjoy so get out there get Henderson out there and then play a little game of
[3336.28 - 3341.40] P:1705.28 E:0.091848 |  keep ball can you get it into the little area bit up next to the penalty area to then drive in
[3341.40 - 3346.28] P:1614.62 E:0.081447 |  that's going to be the key that's where we are because also Kane will come over and he's got the
[3346.28 - 3351.56] P:1661.82 E:0.091207 |  hat up a hand against Upper McCarna. Yeah Kane's decided Upper McCarna is who he's going to go up against
[3351.56 - 3356.68] P:1832.97 E:0.090768 |  doesn't he? And we said it again before before the game I think it was it's obvious one
[3356.68 - 3360.52] P:1868.49 E:0.102709 |  Upper McCarna makes a big mistake on a big chance and I think Kane is a little bit slower I have to
[3360.60 - 3364.28] P:1978.40 E:0.099212 |  say to if he'd been a bit sharper he would have been even earlier on the ball and I think
[3364.28 - 3369.72] P:1975.28 E:0.094750 |  he would have been there too early for Lloris and instead Athol he was slightly slow to react maybe
[3369.72 - 3374.28] P:1942.70 E:0.092738 |  or to get in in front of Upper McCarna and then Lloris makes a really good save and we mentioned
[3374.28 - 3380.44] P:1976.50 E:0.092900 |  Hugo before on how he had to respond tonight and having a good game and so far I have to say
[3380.44 - 3384.12] P:1884.93 E:0.100410 |  he's done great and there will be more pressure for Mingdan in the second half for me it's not
[3384.12 - 3389.00] P:1834.56 E:0.093154 |  going to be a nice watch that second half I can guarantee you. Jules it would be fair to say wouldn't
[3389.32 - 3393.64] P:1760.56 E:0.097324 |  it I mean you're down there. Pissed out England did seem to cut frustrated figures at the end of that
[3393.64 - 3401.88] P:1807.72 E:0.085197 |  first half. Frustrated figures but Jordan Pickford wants to watch watching Killian and Bate from this
[3401.88 - 3408.12] P:1832.33 E:0.081335 |  viewpoint behind Jordan Pickford's goal in the first half a devastating pace that he's got he
[3408.12 - 3414.20] P:1867.55 E:0.085180 |  turned Declan Rice in the middle in the build up to that goal that frustrated Jordan Pickford he
[3414.20 - 3418.12] P:1849.02 E:0.094965 |  hasn't been in the best of moves obviously in the first half and he had a really long chat with
[3418.12 - 3424.36] P:1755.20 E:0.077203 |  Declan Rice as the French players were celebrating in the corner flag to my left here and then
[3424.36 - 3432.20] P:1764.86 E:0.082699 |  interestingly during that VAR penalty check Garith Southgate had a long conversation with Declan
[3432.20 - 3438.84] P:1421.74 E:0.088759 |  Rice as well he's been turned by Mbappe two or three times in this first half and the England fans
[3438.84 - 3445.48] P:1522.22 E:0.096957 |  behind me the mood was so good we had the cardboard cut out of David Beckham who's also here in the
[3445.56 - 3451.40] P:1443.15 E:0.094397 |  stadium tonight but just looking around me now they're sort of slouched on the on the wall in
[3451.40 - 3457.00] P:1564.79 E:0.087325 |  front of them if they are on the front row others are just checking in on their phones the mood
[3457.00 - 3464.52] P:1543.23 E:0.091635 |  certainly needs to be lifted and the way they they ran off the England players they ran off the pitch
[3464.52 - 3470.12] P:1627.08 E:0.093248 |  to go into that halftime team talk it didn't look too bad they thought we're still in it they the
[3470.12 - 3475.56] P:1471.55 E:0.093200 |  mood looked good as far as the players were concerned but Jordan Pickford probably the most
[3475.56 - 3482.28] P:1669.59 E:0.086141 |  frustrated of the loss and hopefully you know whatever's being said in that dressing room
[3482.28 - 3487.32] P:1755.00 E:0.086508 |  right now at halftime that energy is going to be channeled if you're an England fan and a more
[3487.32 - 3494.60] P:1725.49 E:0.077333 |  positive response will be in the second half well John Murray's used a sort of mixture of Mime
[3495.32 - 3502.60] P:1671.24 E:0.095320 |  and ITV screens to to try and see because they've had more replays than us to try and see whether
[3502.60 - 3508.44] P:1613.85 E:0.087636 |  it was outside the box or not yeah well our colleagues Simon Lydix and they're down there
[3508.44 - 3513.72] P:1646.09 E:0.100548 |  and I caught their eye and they're intimated that they felt that it was a penalty and I've I can see
[3513.72 - 3519.80] P:1561.52 E:0.098387 |  their pictures from here and I must say the picture we've not had these pictures it did look to me as
[3519.88 - 3525.72] P:1482.09 E:0.097527 |  though the contact was inside the penalty area Rob at the I can't Harry Kane is I don't know how
[3525.72 - 3531.16] P:1564.64 E:0.099039 |  many hundreds of games he's played and hundreds of goals he's scored he knows what he's doing
[3531.16 - 3536.04] P:1652.39 E:0.100977 |  he's not going to go down if he's outside the box in his instinct it's under his feet or it's not
[3536.04 - 3541.64] P:1709.09 E:0.100731 |  he knows where he is so surely he's there he's the best person to judge that he knows he's got
[3541.64 - 3546.36] P:1652.07 E:0.098865 |  the wrong side of a moment up on the car now he knows the tackles come in he knows where he is
[3546.36 - 3552.84] P:1642.12 E:0.094968 |  either in or around the penalty area I just I mine thinks that penalty the replays are tight
[3552.84 - 3557.88] P:1687.42 E:0.097395 |  but I still stick with that I think so I have to say I thought it was a pen straight away from where
[3558.68 - 3563.88] P:1766.57 E:0.106068 |  from where we sit here I think we had a very good angle of it I have to be honest I'm not even sure
[3563.88 - 3569.96] P:1748.02 E:0.103585 |  it's outside of the box I think that yeah I think I thought it was going to be given as a review from

[3697.64 - 3702.84] P:1909.47 E:0.098809 |  is Lopez the slight favourite it's hard it's hard to say only 29 years old he's had a good career
[3702.84 - 3708.28] P:1967.04 E:0.088600 |  26 wins only two losses and he's on a good bit of a run so I think Warrington's got his work
[3708.28 - 3711.96] P:1864.94 E:0.101509 |  quite out but his here at home in Leeds you know what he's like he's a warrior he finds a little

[3716.68 - 3720.44] P:1899.10 E:0.092175 |  he's a tough strong guy Warrington it's hard to write him off I've done that a couple of times in
[3720.44 - 3725.00] P:1924.46 E:0.091305 |  the past I thought Lee Selby might do him on skill and that Warrington was just too much for him so
[3725.00 - 3728.60] P:1918.99 E:0.087418 |  if he can turn up tonight like he did against someone like Selby I reckon he's got every
[3728.60 - 3733.00] P:1834.89 E:0.085251 |  chance of winning this it's a good one they've paused the bounce haven't they so that everybody
[3733.00 - 3738.68] P:1926.72 E:0.083943 |  can watch the foreboard before the boxing restart I mean he's a Leeds lad in front of
[3738.68 - 3743.88] P:1838.46 E:0.085247 |  is he in front of his home crowd if this goes wrong for England here in Qatar tonight he'll
[3743.88 - 3749.16] P:1856.71 E:0.085266 |  just hope that his own fans can rouse themselves to get themselves going for the fight well hopefully
[3749.16 - 3753.00] P:1821.65 E:0.103175 |  he can build them back up yeah but how do they stop a boxing match for a football match I asked
[3753.00 - 3758.28] P:1759.66 E:0.103672 |  myself I suppose it is the World Cup so we can we can allow that but no if we do lose which I hope
[3758.28 - 3762.76] P:1727.25 E:0.089859 |  we don't what was still one we're one nil down aren't we I mean what a shame and Harry Kane's
[3762.76 - 3766.76] P:1792.04 E:0.088272 |  had a couple of chances well did he he needed to clip one over the goalkeeper then he he had that
[3766.76 - 3770.52] P:1773.11 E:0.102966 |  I don't look like a penalty to me he got tucked down I never went to the AR like I've seen worse

[3790.68 - 3795.64] P:1772.96 E:0.090404 |  career where now he needs to be in world title fights so I mean you've got Lee Ward from Nottingham
[3795.64 - 3799.72] P:1769.06 E:0.089099 |  which I think is a great fight but he's been injured injured with his arm but with his arm he's had
[3799.72 - 3804.76] P:1841.18 E:0.089244 |  a bad arm but Leo Santa Cruz for me that's a great fight and that's one I'd like to see because
[3804.76 - 3808.68] P:1805.72 E:0.089553 |  I've seen him a couple of times live and I think he's made for Josh Warrington that'd be a great

[3836.68 - 3841.32] P:1759.28 E:0.089062 |  they have to keep reminding themselves for sure they just have to be patient but I think at some
[3841.32 - 3847.64] P:1726.69 E:0.101873 |  stage they're going to have to bring folding inside and bring on some pace of a sterling or a
[3847.64 - 3853.56] P:1897.37 E:0.094598 |  rashford to exploit down the wings because on that counter attack France do look a little bit
[3853.56 - 3858.04] P:1841.41 E:0.088827 |  vulnerable Kane's coming deep so if they can get runners in behind they'll create a little bit more
[3858.92 - 3865.80] P:1647.13 E:0.090672 |  okay England are back out Paul is on the centre spot let's rejoin Rob Green and John Murray

[3889.72 - 3896.20] P:1904.50 E:0.090058 |  he said yes penalty should have been but it wasn't so England have got to put it behind them

[3940.04 - 3946.44] P:1959.62 E:0.097290 |  Shaw and then McGuire back to Luke Shaw Bellingham allows it to run Bellingham then takes it back
[3946.44 - 3952.44] P:1994.51 E:0.112980 |  from Fordham and Bellingham carrying it on is challenged by Dembele at Runster Fordham whose
[3952.44 - 3959.96] P:1872.21 E:0.109205 |  cross low into the penalty area is lacked behind by Upo McCarno and that's a yellow card for Dembele's
[3959.96 - 3965.80] P:1845.58 E:0.098164 |  challenge on Jude Bellingham and the referee played an advantage there it will be a corner
[3965.80 - 3972.12] P:1859.77 E:0.099219 |  and that is a yellow card for Dembele. Good early play from England combining down the left hand side
[3972.20 - 3974.92] P:1912.73 E:0.101069 |  Bellingham taking the blow and it was a rash challenge
[3976.36 - 3983.24] P:1641.65 E:0.104522 |  from Dembele but England have to stay confident in this half have to keep on creating the chances
[3983.80 - 3989.24] P:1752.31 E:0.097815 |  and have to stay positive when they're out of possession I think that's key to this second half
[3989.24 - 3993.88] P:1980.27 E:0.101961 |  corner for England from the left Fordham to take it flight to he's looking for McGuire but it's headed
[3993.88 - 3999.88] P:2030.57 E:0.102988 |  away by Varan comes out to the edge of the area oh Bellingham with a shot from the D and Loris
[3999.88 - 4006.60] P:1993.24 E:0.105329 |  makes the save leaping high that was brilliantly hit in the D and Bellingham there is waving his
[4006.60 - 4011.80] P:1971.42 E:0.103525 |  arms at the England fans behind that goal to tell them to up the volume third big save from Loris.
[4011.80 - 4017.40] P:1931.86 E:0.094461 |  Yeah fantastic save and one that gets congratulations from his team makes Bellingham can't believe it
[4017.40 - 4024.12] P:1901.68 E:0.095339 |  probably just too close to Loris too central but great reactions hit it really well. Fordham's
[4024.12 - 4028.28] P:1840.84 E:0.098557 |  gone out to the far side now to take this corner so it'll be a left-footed in swinger just the two
[4028.28 - 4032.28] P:1850.58 E:0.096716 |  men near the penalty spot this time lots of movement in the six yard box deep onto the back
[4032.28 - 4036.44] P:1960.09 E:0.108600 |  post McGuire with a header and it bounces off Rice back into the clubs of Loris.
[4037.72 - 4045.00] P:1944.22 E:0.090577 |  McGuire again found the space got his head to the ball but it didn't fall for England.
[4045.00 - 4052.76] P:1818.79 E:0.093708 |  Loris sixes and sevens that went drifting way beyond his far post and tripped over his own feet
[4053.72 - 4057.96] P:1865.60 E:0.102294 |  I think it's starting to think it's someone's day when the ball just dropped back into his hands
[4057.96 - 4063.88] P:1938.30 E:0.105317 |  rather than into the net. I'm thinking back to the remember the nation's league final of last year
[4064.52 - 4072.12] P:1880.38 E:0.097051 |  which is a brilliant match and Loris had just one of those days and he's had he's had a lot of one
[4072.12 - 4079.16] P:1925.65 E:0.104021 |  of those days playing for the French national team and here he is that's why he's won 143 caps
[4080.04 - 4083.48] P:1860.29 E:0.099676 |  and it is France who are ringing the ball out from the back
[4084.44 - 4088.60] P:1874.81 E:0.100631 |  twice kept out Harry Kane in the first half important save from Bellingham even though you
[4088.60 - 4094.52] P:1897.40 E:0.110579 |  perhaps was found wanting a little there in those moments and Super McConnell takes the ball away
[4094.52 - 4100.20] P:1884.22 E:0.101826 |  from Henderson and then is fouled by Saka and that is a free kick just to the left of the centre
[4100.20 - 4105.80] P:1770.62 E:0.094521 |  circle stopped in his tracks by Saka that's a mismatch isn't it Saka Saka taking down up a
[4105.88 - 4112.04] P:1840.69 E:0.089679 |  McConnell to a Manny and then France going back into their own half
[4113.88 - 4114.36] P:1775.00 E:0.105392 |  France

[4123.16 - 4131.16] P:1917.26 E:0.104969 |  then there Henderson and Walker and then down he goes that is a free kick Jordan Henderson is pleading
[4131.16 - 4138.52] P:1866.38 E:0.098387 |  and I think he's suggesting that there wasn't a great deal in that and Mbappe has thrown himself
[4138.52 - 4144.60] P:1805.66 E:0.102984 |  to the ground but it's a free kick that's been given yeah it's a modern day foul where Mbappe's
[4144.60 - 4149.40] P:1831.16 E:0.095416 |  running down the wing does a step over pushes the ball forward and then stops running and Jordan

[4195.48 - 4201.48] P:1872.01 E:0.100729 |  French so free kick to England must say Jordan Henderson's covered a lot of ground in this match
[4201.48 - 4207.64] P:1823.63 E:0.089798 |  really good running there he says thankless that he's not gonna never gonna get the ball but
[4207.64 - 4213.00] P:1800.98 E:0.098588 |  he forces Larisse into an early clearance which then makes Olivier Giroud offside
[4213.00 - 4219.40] P:1885.01 E:0.099001 |  England win the ball back job done I hear they had six days six days off since the last matches

[4237.00 - 4242.28] P:1663.68 E:0.109318 |  available in field and then back to Henderson he pulls his pass in field to Declan Wright's

[4262.84 - 4267.48] P:1877.83 E:0.110607 |  Ravio inside the area and France survive and actually more than survive they're taken away on
[4267.48 - 4273.40] P:1955.76 E:0.113589 |  the counter attack and Bappe all the pass through the middle to Shiru who takes a poor touch and it
[4273.40 - 4279.88] P:1908.17 E:0.113029 |  bounces the Stones and England then take possession again and look to come forward that was a waste
[4279.88 - 4286.36] P:1941.48 E:0.113505 |  by France brilliant Bappe pass that Shiru wasn't able to take advantage of Saka now Saka slips
[4286.36 - 4293.64] P:2022.80 E:0.117642 |  it into the area balling him back to Saka oh Saka is the penalty he was sent smalling
[4294.20 - 4301.48] P:2005.88 E:0.120521 |  Shuremeini dived in lovely footwork from the Arsenal man and this time they were denied in the
[4301.48 - 4307.80] P:1935.30 E:0.114587 |  first half but not in the second and England have a penalty and it's going to be Kane against
[4307.80 - 4315.72] P:1899.80 E:0.108517 |  Loris from the spot well there was absolutely no doubt about this one Saka did really well
[4315.72 - 4320.60] P:1845.51 E:0.098200 |  they've looked sharp down that right hand side since the start of second half and again he drove
[4320.60 - 4327.80] P:1836.14 E:0.101951 |  inside got onto his left foot too many knew he knew that as soon as he stepped across soon as he
[4327.80 - 4335.40] P:1876.41 E:0.094169 |  made that lunge there was very little argument from any French player and it's Tottenham versus Tottenham
[4336.92 - 4343.72] P:1900.76 E:0.103556 |  well this is absolutely fascinating Yugo Loris they're great friends they spend so much time together
[4343.72 - 4350.44] P:1925.52 E:0.114880 |  but Bappe's just going over to Loris to give him some advice I think he knows all he needs to know
[4351.48 - 4358.76] P:1929.35 E:0.108906 |  I think so spent so much time together wives and families on days off and they're not looking
[4358.76 - 4365.64] P:1947.09 E:0.107401 |  at one another Harry Kane is standing over the ball leaning forward Harry Kane this to equal Wayne
[4365.64 - 4373.48] P:1922.49 E:0.106899 |  Rooney's 53 goals for England stands up now shuffles back Loris steps forward huge moment in the
[4373.72 - 4380.28] P:1936.50 E:0.104049 |  World Cup quarterfinal Kane waits one foot in front of the other there's the whistle
[4382.04 - 4387.08] P:1903.17 E:0.111183 |  and the England captain just walks forward and doesn't like the way that the ball is placed on
[4387.08 - 4395.56] P:1936.49 E:0.118587 |  the spot you never see this you never see this he's walked forward and replaced the ball on the spot
[4396.52 - 4404.68] P:1933.68 E:0.102631 |  and now we'll step back again Harry Kane from the penalty spot for England against Hugo Loris
[4405.80 - 4413.96] P:2059.65 E:0.120005 |  up he comes right footed and drives it in it's 1-1 Kane beats Loris and it's England 1
[4413.96 - 4417.16] P:2040.62 E:0.118939 |  France 1 and it's game on
[4419.96 - 4431.16] P:1937.47 E:0.118762 |  in front of the England fans so composed so cool to be able to stand and wait and say no it's not
[4431.16 - 4437.88] P:1913.44 E:0.114052 |  right I'm going to do it on my terms and he did it in a Harry Kane way the Harry Kane penalty that
[4437.88 - 4445.56] P:1842.85 E:0.110955 |  we've seen so many times batters it home to lorises right but England have been sharp in this
[4445.56 - 4449.96] P:1734.66 E:0.106941 |  second half it's been a bright start they got the reward whilst they've been playing well
[4450.84 - 4457.96] P:1935.67 E:0.099469 |  Loris went the wrong way dive to his left Kane fired it into the net and that means that Harry
[4458.04 - 4470.20] P:1902.92 E:0.100377 |  Kane draws alongside Wayne Rooney on 53 goals for England 80 caps 53 goals and power to add
[4471.16 - 4477.56] P:1931.54 E:0.108077 |  and now that is two goals in the knockout stages of this World Cup for Harry Kane England's record
[4477.56 - 4484.04] P:1887.69 E:0.100814 |  scorer from the penalty spot to his 17th goal for England but France coming forth
[4484.12 - 4489.80] P:1871.25 E:0.109350 |  Ravioli the shot which is dived and saved down to his left by Pickford and it just opened up for
[4489.80 - 4494.84] P:1888.55 E:0.100189 |  the France midfielder but Pickford kept it out fantastic run completely missed by the
[4494.84 - 4501.80] P:1818.57 E:0.096177 |  England backline big save from Jordan Pickford what he's expected to make but he said be ready he
[4501.80 - 4507.40] P:1954.37 E:0.103467 |  was alive the England defence wasn't Kane has carried the ball out of play on the halfway lane
[4507.40 - 4514.36] P:1991.21 E:0.107339 |  well it's opening up now Harry Kane scored his goal at the end where Juliet Farrington is watching
[4514.36 - 4521.16] P:1936.24 E:0.095839 |  in amongst all other photographers and Harry Kane took three puffs of breath before he fired that
[4521.16 - 4527.64] P:1871.98 E:0.087407 |  penalty into the back of the net he then kissed his hand and he then screamed in delight as he
[4527.64 - 4534.12] P:1885.75 E:0.096916 |  ran towards the corner flag to my right and then the rest of the England players just absolutely
[4534.20 - 4540.12] P:1957.46 E:0.095968 |  piled on to him John. England coming forward with Thornton on the left hand side taking Juliet
[4540.92 - 4546.84] P:1901.78 E:0.101156 |  Thornton back towards Kane Kane who's challenged good challenge as well from Ravioli and now he
[4546.84 - 4552.04] P:1969.07 E:0.103556 |  has Mbappe has gone with him they check back together still going shoulder to shoulder
[4552.04 - 4556.12] P:2038.33 E:0.108385 |  Mbappe trying to get around the outside he has he's pulled it across on his bench
[4556.12 - 4561.40] P:1962.92 E:0.112229 |  off Dempeli inside the penalty area however back to Griezmann Griezmann's ball across the box is
[4561.40 - 4567.80] P:1953.95 E:0.103746 |  straight into the path of Henderson who's able to volley it away well Walker had some triumphs in
[4567.80 - 4572.68] P:1984.46 E:0.107468 |  the first half but Mbappe won that one but England playing it down the left Thornton will struggle
[4572.68 - 4579.80] P:1959.37 E:0.109862 |  to keep that in and he can't reach it and it's out of play what a contest that was Walker and Mbappe
[4580.92 - 4587.40] P:1842.05 E:0.097924 |  there is the man there is the moment that a lot of these neutrals here have come to see
[4587.40 - 4594.52] P:1946.41 E:0.100273 |  where's the next drum free shoulder to shoulder raise it's incredible goodness me that was like
[4594.52 - 4603.72] P:1990.93 E:0.106949 |  you name it center and frost that's me and you John not quite but um there were quite a few
[4603.72 - 4610.36] P:1925.70 E:0.103499 |  horsepower at work there and Walker was beaten by him only just but he was beaten by him and actually
[4610.36 - 4616.76] P:1912.89 E:0.097561 |  it could easily have resulted in France retaking the lead so this is a good response from France
[4616.84 - 4622.12] P:1920.42 E:0.097944 |  really from from England taking them back yeah you wondered how they'd respond England responded
[4622.12 - 4626.12] P:1817.51 E:0.097050 |  really well to conceding and they've been on the front for ever since really they're all of a sudden
[4626.84 - 4633.72] P:1912.30 E:0.086762 |  England that laps the concentration the stats show the next five minutes after a goal goes in
[4633.72 - 4639.40] P:1906.26 E:0.098567 |  it is crucial that you do not concede because it happens so often and England have just switched
[4639.40 - 4645.64] P:1864.46 E:0.099941 |  off five live and BBC sounds we're across Africa on the world service it's England one France one
[4645.64 - 4650.92] P:1902.02 E:0.096680 |  there is a 606 phone in tonight after five live sport with Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton
[4650.92 - 4657.00] P:1893.98 E:0.093954 |  and the winners of this match will play Morocco here on Wednesday night but it could go long
[4657.00 - 4663.00] P:1862.34 E:0.100484 |  but the taste and intensity of this match I mean who would bet against more goals during the course
[4663.00 - 4669.56] P:1923.76 E:0.099171 |  of the 90 minutes yeah it was a little bit slow a little bit passive at times when France were
[4669.56 - 4676.44] P:1833.08 E:0.090184 |  dictating and then France could sit in now all of a sudden it's been moments of real electricity
[4677.64 - 4682.60] P:1814.38 E:0.099808 |  credit to Sacher as well for the winning of the penalty yeah he's a real joy we've on this on the
[4682.60 - 4687.88] P:1751.69 E:0.092697 |  right hand side and he had joy moments before and maybe picked the wrong pass while driving down
[4687.88 - 4694.36] P:1873.51 E:0.073417 |  to the line and trying to cut it back but there did well took the extra touch Tura Manny Gamble got it
[4694.36 - 4702.04] P:1896.70 E:0.081701 |  wrong England one France one so Harry Kane with the equaliser from the spot the ball coming back at
[4702.04 - 4706.84] P:1953.47 E:0.088951 |  the England defence stones heads it forward Dalligan then nods it back into the full back position
[4707.72 - 4714.04] P:1893.20 E:0.098165 |  and Luke Shaw it's a long left-footed pass Griezmann heads it back into his own half per rare
[4714.04 - 4721.00] P:1812.65 E:0.105984 |  Harry Kane now that is eight goals at a world cup so he's two behind Gary Lennick as England record
[4721.64 - 4728.20] P:1855.35 E:0.102630 |  he stretches his record to 12 goals in major tournaments either European Championship or
[4728.20 - 4736.12] P:1867.26 E:0.100925 |  World Cup which is an England record on his own now here is Maguire passing the ball back
[4736.12 - 4742.52] P:1917.70 E:0.101988 |  to Golgi Bapitford where the ball it is beat it's just having a little bit of a breather after that
[4742.52 - 4749.16] P:1814.64 E:0.093715 |  intense first 10 minutes or so to the second great full pass to Shaw yes I think we all are
[4749.16 - 4755.40] P:1778.53 E:0.087289 |  Rob Green England World Cup goalkeeper watching from on high we'll hear from Michael Richards later
[4755.40 - 4761.00] P:1819.52 E:0.087744 |  as well who's with us here and Harry Maguire carrying the ball towards the halfway line
[4761.00 - 4765.72] P:1800.07 E:0.092455 |  Maguire just tapping the ball to the left Dalligan then goes back towards John Stones
[4766.36 - 4770.60] P:1789.34 E:0.096551 |  so even Stevens now his first meeting between England and France
[4771.72 - 4776.76] P:2015.39 E:0.111554 |  at a World Cup knockout match through the middle to Saka Saka now finds a position in shoots but
[4776.76 - 4783.96] P:1952.38 E:0.099403 |  weekly the French were closing in on all sides four of them and in the end it was a weak shot
[4783.96 - 4789.64] P:1942.28 E:0.102767 |  but an exciting run yeah finding real joy all over the pitch now Saka is in a central position
[4789.64 - 4796.20] P:1945.21 E:0.081469 |  just in the middle of midfield picked up the ball and drove he's on to his weaker foot four players
[4796.20 - 4801.72] P:1995.97 E:0.087593 |  virgin on him so the more comfortable safe the release here's the dangerous Griezmann oh a
[4801.72 - 4807.48] P:1958.82 E:0.096497 |  lovely reverse pass to Mbappe Mbappe then under pressure gives it to Dembele Dembele on his left
[4807.48 - 4812.12] P:2012.76 E:0.102148 |  foot shoots well that's blocked in the box by Stones and Stones has got enough on it to deflect
[4812.12 - 4819.64] P:1978.06 E:0.093126 |  it out for a throw down here on the right hand side Kunde kicks to Dembele Dalligan tight to him
[4820.28 - 4827.08] P:1933.86 E:0.093900 |  Dembele again turns Dembele and Dalligan goes with him Dembele runs away in field gives it to
[4827.08 - 4831.64] P:1973.79 E:0.106192 |  Mbappe and Dembele tries to work it in field that was blocked by Walker dances to Bellingham
[4831.64 - 4836.52] P:1934.47 E:0.101783 |  Harry Kane makes a run one way Foden makes a run four down the left Bellingham plays it into the
[4836.52 - 4843.40] P:1967.79 E:0.096599 |  full back position Foden holds off Kunde Foden has got it no support from there though so Foden
[4843.40 - 4848.84] P:1980.91 E:0.096832 |  takes it on in the middle and then back towards Bellingham there is support now Henderson centrally
[4848.84 - 4856.76] P:1921.91 E:0.088903 |  30 yards out out to the right hand side Saka back to Jordan Henderson again and then Bukai Osaka
[4857.08 - 4864.84] P:1952.75 E:0.095069 |  taking on Theo Hernandez Hernandez just watches and then Harry Kane makes himself available
[4864.84 - 4869.56] P:1996.45 E:0.111115 |  and on to his left foot shoots low but weekly this time Loris is able to go down to his left
[4869.56 - 4877.48] P:1932.09 E:0.101137 |  and just drop on it everything is going through Bukai Osaka at the minute he has been absolutely
[4877.48 - 4882.44] P:1933.46 E:0.098244 |  brilliant in the second half got joy in the first half but now just taking it on a level
[4883.40 - 4888.68] P:1858.80 E:0.092607 |  I can take this to the French defense I can take these guys on I can dictate the play
[4888.68 - 4893.88] P:1852.13 E:0.086635 |  much like Griezmann was doing in the first half this is why Garry Southgate brought Saka back
[4893.88 - 4899.64] P:1845.94 E:0.091627 |  into the starting lineup for the previous match he said he's just being too good in training
[4899.64 - 4905.32] P:1751.77 E:0.101492 |  and in the matches so he can't leave him out just a really really good play
[4906.04 - 4911.16] P:1940.53 E:0.112347 |  The question is when the change is come who's going to come off?
[4911.88 - 4917.56] P:2004.27 E:0.106003 |  Here's Foden Foden forward to Bellingham then Foden again turns inside Griezmann and Foden
[4917.56 - 4922.20] P:1969.75 E:0.108025 |  puffs that puffs that chest out and Foden's off on the run now from inside his own half and he's
[4922.20 - 4927.80] P:1965.13 E:0.113402 |  fouled by Griezmann leaning into him right Griezmann who has been yellow carded already in this
[4927.80 - 4933.96] P:1921.86 E:0.096340 |  match commits the foul when Foden could have been away that yeah Foden's in power the referee
[4933.96 - 4939.00] P:1903.92 E:0.086112 |  is having none of it there's four or five England players making that exact point and I think what
[4939.00 - 4945.32] P:1882.61 E:0.100506 |  saves him is Olivier Giroud has a little tug then Turemene has a go and then it's Griezmann with the
[4945.32 - 4951.72] P:1927.62 E:0.102023 |  last one I think it's just gone his way down before which saves Griezmann well that falls into the
[4951.72 - 4958.04] P:1875.42 E:0.098906 |  category of if he hadn't already been booked yes he would have been booked it needs to be a strong
[4958.04 - 4965.96] P:1884.48 E:0.097760 |  yellow England won France won France scored in the 17th minute of the first half England equalised
[4965.96 - 4973.96] P:1935.31 E:0.101174 |  with Harry Kane's penalty in the 54th free kick on the halfway line referee Sam Powell says come on
[4973.96 - 4979.00] P:1966.16 E:0.103368 |  get on with it and that's what Harry Maguire now do it right foot at board just dropped into
[4979.56 - 4986.12] P:1990.01 E:0.099063 |  the full back position for Foden to be challenged by Kunde, Shaw and Kane Kaine tries to find the
[4986.12 - 4991.80] P:2009.49 E:0.109250 |  pass but Kunde cuts it out and now Griezmann's bringing it forward Declan Rice is there doing the
[4991.80 - 4997.96] P:1974.00 E:0.097612 |  job but I'm sure Garas Southgate told him to do to snuff out the danger of Griezmann puts it out for
[4997.96 - 5002.20] P:1899.84 E:0.104858 |  the front yeah fantastic work from Declan Rice everyone's seen it so many times for England now
[5002.84 - 5009.88] P:1910.49 E:0.094670 |  Kane's got real jeopardy in it opening up all over let's say Harry Kane has has really caught the
[5009.88 - 5017.40] P:1857.39 E:0.091270 |  eye tonight scoring the equaliser equal in Wayne Ruining's England record and at the moment though
[5017.40 - 5028.28] P:1816.69 E:0.103109 |  England having to defend France finding Kunde on the right hand side neither coaches made a change
[5028.28 - 5033.24] P:1933.64 E:0.107891 |  yet and we've played over an hour there's an overhead pass from the centre field England will
[5033.32 - 5037.72] P:1931.58 E:0.101036 |  happily take that it's through from Dembele for a goal kick to England
[5039.56 - 5043.96] P:1807.04 E:0.112183 |  face Harry Kane's penalties plenty of times and we did the work that Leriz would have done that
[5043.96 - 5049.40] P:1943.84 E:0.104556 |  every goalkeeper has done that has ever faced Harry Kane and we worked out if he does take it to your
[5049.40 - 5053.96] P:1839.40 E:0.106028 |  right hand side you've got no chance to save and he hit it that hard anyway so you may as well go
[5053.96 - 5061.96] P:1771.62 E:0.103622 |  to your left that's what Leriz did remember well I mean he's hit something I just unstoppable the one
[5061.96 - 5065.80] P:1785.13 E:0.103539 |  that he scored for his 50th goal for England in Munich in the summer in the nation's league
[5065.80 - 5071.32] P:1878.46 E:0.103359 |  there's an extraordinarily hit penalty past Manuel Neuer Kane on the right here he is playing the ball
[5071.32 - 5076.20] P:1987.50 E:0.116841 |  to Saka and Saka goes down in between two French defenders we're at for you again right there it
[5076.20 - 5082.68] P:1968.68 E:0.115195 |  says no free kick it did look like one and then England have penalised Henderson so they take it
[5082.68 - 5088.36] P:1957.69 E:0.096290 |  quickly the French greasemen England have got to settle themselves forget about it ball is played
[5088.36 - 5094.68] P:1882.07 E:0.094817 |  by Turemene had to the left hand side a little wiggle of the hips from Mbappe back to Turemene
[5094.68 - 5099.40] P:1917.61 E:0.111654 |  chips into the area beyond Giroud who falls rather awkwardly actually but it was pre-ondoned through
[5099.40 - 5106.12] P:1829.12 E:0.105277 |  and it's a goal kick and Saka has gone down in center field having been on the receiving end of
[5106.12 - 5111.80] P:1814.60 E:0.092551 |  that double challenge yeah it was a foul it was clear as day I'm not sure what
[5112.52 - 5117.72] P:1875.56 E:0.093117 |  a little somehow a scene but maybe a Giroud down at the other end just caught it studs in the ground
[5117.72 - 5124.04] P:1933.89 E:0.090044 |  I think sliding for that ball yeah it did look awkward didn't it from Giroud as he stretched for it
[5125.00 - 5131.56] P:1860.86 E:0.090116 |  and I think I did see him just feeling that his hand string as he was getting up Saka meanwhile
[5131.56 - 5138.76] P:1926.08 E:0.090012 |  is okay just there was a bit of movement on the on the side of the pitch should have been a foul
[5138.76 - 5146.28] P:1877.50 E:0.098067 |  Saka playing now Rabiel giving him a behind and yeah it's baffling he's right there he stood there
[5146.28 - 5151.08] P:1811.28 E:0.095048 |  watching the game he's in a good position yeah great position right up with the player the referee
[5151.96 - 5158.04] P:1874.68 E:0.090849 |  but didn't get it it's a Jordan Henderson just chatting with Saka there yeah one piece he's gonna
[5158.04 - 5166.20] P:1941.97 E:0.093528 |  be able to carry on because he's hobbling a bit would be a loss player that he's that he's been
[5166.20 - 5171.80] P:1735.61 E:0.106953 |  a man who won the penalty he's just he's just testing himself Saka on the far side Rice
[5172.04 - 5177.96] P:1819.56 E:0.100038 |  keeps possession for England just keeping half an eye on where the players and half an eye on
[5177.96 - 5188.28] P:1758.46 E:0.094324 |  Pocayo Saka England substitutes warming up down to Highlath England won France won so the semifinals
[5188.28 - 5194.04] P:1774.27 E:0.096063 |  on Tuesday night both seven o'clock kickoffs UK time you'll hear Argentina Croatia and then a
[5194.04 - 5201.24] P:1750.83 E:0.090110 |  Wednesday night Morocco against question mark after their win against Portugal earlier on the
[5201.24 - 5205.56] P:1524.52 E:0.092424 |  season that was an amazing listen actually I listened to the last 20 minutes or so Pat Nevin
[5205.56 - 5210.68] P:1684.43 E:0.091064 |  and Alistair Bruce Ball that that is one I would say go back on sounds and have a listen to the last
[5210.68 - 5217.64] P:1904.44 E:0.096566 |  20 minutes or so of that was it was really quite emotional actually he has Griezmann
[5217.64 - 5223.24] P:1879.12 E:0.101843 |  Griezmann now with the ball in field playing the ball but that's uh it isn't intercepted by Saka
[5223.24 - 5230.92] P:1869.58 E:0.085856 |  it's found its way to Kio Hernandez now Mbappe 40 yards out Mbappe and works into the left hand side
[5231.48 - 5238.12] P:1835.40 E:0.087936 |  and then Hernandez again Mbappe more centrally Saka in front of him Mbappe finds the pass deep
[5238.12 - 5242.36] P:1937.42 E:0.102254 |  across the area Dembele cushions it back into the box but straight to the white shirts of England
[5242.36 - 5248.12] P:1982.81 E:0.103960 |  oh and then Fund does brilliantly well with what was a poor pass from Rice somehow he managed to
[5248.12 - 5253.96] P:1973.30 E:0.097363 |  get that ball control it turn and get it away that was almost a break dance move and a fantastic
[5253.96 - 5260.92] P:1941.50 E:0.099284 |  bit of control at the same time now he did that I've no idea England won France won Halle Le Bleu
[5261.32 - 5268.52] P:1960.73 E:0.103445 |  they're singing I haven't heard the coop back to the meson champ yet or summit
[5269.32 - 5276.84] P:1969.84 E:0.101978 |  and the ball just rolling away behind for a gold kick for England won the score bought the match to
[5276.84 - 5285.88] P:1949.78 E:0.099340 |  play penalty shootouts in both matches yesterday one meal in the earlier match I have to say Rob
[5285.88 - 5290.28] P:1923.29 E:0.093952 |  coming here like I said it's you in the car I felt that this would be settled in 90 minutes
[5293.80 - 5301.72] P:1884.00 E:0.090510 |  well you've all tightened up haven't they games they've gone along and uh yeah that game at the end
[5301.72 - 5307.88] P:1922.55 E:0.110306 |  and earlier for Portugal there's all hands to the bump from Morocco and Saka is being handled by
[5307.88 - 5313.80] P:1938.03 E:0.103099 |  Hernandez and this time the ironic cheers from the England supporters many of them in the in the
[5313.80 - 5319.64] P:1862.70 E:0.101751 |  seats behind the goal to our left the free kick this time sat peace for England all to the right
[5319.64 - 5324.68] P:1836.15 E:0.111065 |  yeah and it might be sound a bit old school but England are winning the aerial battles all over
[5324.68 - 5330.44] P:1796.34 E:0.108139 |  the pitch when the ball goes long and so Jordan Pickers hits a couple long Kane's won the ball
[5330.44 - 5337.96] P:1873.79 E:0.103929 |  and it's the second ball might sound like I'm from 1996 or before but sometimes it works
[5338.92 - 5339.96] P:1987.60 E:0.112142 |  for the break
[5341.72 - 5347.48] P:1923.05 E:0.098923 |  free kick for England on the right then it's so often in this world cup this is the fifth match
[5347.48 - 5353.24] P:1807.80 E:0.096281 |  they found the head of Harry McGuire but it's not ended up in the net remember the header he had
[5353.24 - 5359.16] P:1768.14 E:0.096617 |  against the bar in the in the opening group match for England against Iran so three kick on the right
[5359.16 - 5367.16] P:1937.46 E:0.105305 |  the score is one one Henderson fires it in this time oh it's just right just right in the foot of
[5367.24 - 5377.48] P:1908.72 E:0.095896 |  the post big chance but just wide I think he saved it no reaction of the England player says he
[5377.48 - 5381.72] P:1849.96 E:0.088351 |  saved it it looked like it's all kept yeah looks like he was drifting wide
[5383.48 - 5390.68] P:1813.09 E:0.087834 |  the Reese was covered it that's for sure but he's threatened a few times outside of the post
[5391.64 - 5397.80] P:1887.94 E:0.094522 |  the very outside of the post I think Maurice had that color
[5397.80 - 5399.96] P:1901.76 E:0.092884 |  Rob yeah got a good dive in a good time
[5402.04 - 5409.32] P:1856.24 E:0.089943 |  England won France won another near thing that's the second time now that McGuire has struck post
[5409.32 - 5415.72] P:1917.03 E:0.097461 |  all bar at this world cup Kane does extremely well looking for the run of Saka this time
[5416.28 - 5423.40] P:1949.63 E:0.096945 |  Hernandez gets the better of Saka by Fair means he has Rice to Henderson
[5424.12 - 5430.28] P:1940.15 E:0.106957 |  at the Declan Rice again looks up here's the pass long to the left hand side Ford wins the header
[5430.28 - 5435.40] P:1943.29 E:0.100169 |  Francis Tishor in the box shows attempted cross that was blocked by the defender who is right in
[5435.40 - 5441.48] P:1993.08 E:0.107562 |  front of it Rice again is there to head it down and then Harry Kane back towards the halfway line
[5442.36 - 5447.56] P:1918.92 E:0.104655 |  I think we can declare currently England on the better team Rob also I think out of all the
[5447.56 - 5456.20] P:1916.71 E:0.096079 |  quarterfinals this has been the most enthralling out of them really two good well-matched teams
[5456.20 - 5462.92] P:1994.01 E:0.106416 |  in terms of the interplay and players yes here is Shaw Shaw now takes it on had to look whipped
[5462.92 - 5469.64] P:2014.19 E:0.110040 |  to the cross oh just wide Saka was arriving Hernandez was there I think they got there almost
[5469.72 - 5474.04] P:2003.00 E:0.096306 |  together and the ball well the official say it was Saka who got the touch because he's been
[5474.04 - 5480.12] P:1927.34 E:0.101337 |  given as a gold kick I don't know I think he's making that up he doesn't know he's finally given a
[5480.12 - 5488.28] P:2006.36 E:0.102881 |  gold kick by luck more fun more fun than judgment he's made the right decision it's just off the
[5488.28 - 5494.84] P:1844.90 E:0.092870 |  inside of Saka's heel I think it may be clipped Hernandez's shin and then hit the shin of Saka
[5494.84 - 5499.08] P:1899.28 E:0.090360 |  as they were arriving on the edge of the six yard box and flew at an angle back across
[5499.16 - 5506.20] P:1830.06 E:0.100209 |  and behind and that was the right decision he's given a free kick I think foul on Hernandez in the
[5506.20 - 5514.76] P:1834.64 E:0.101075 |  end debatable yeah maybe the wrong decision England one France one and then upside flag
[5514.76 - 5520.60] P:1922.15 E:0.096927 |  against Griesen on the edge of the England penalty area and there's applause from Harry
[5520.60 - 5528.52] P:1885.01 E:0.081614 |  McGuire very pointedly actually which I think is making a point so uh one one it remains
[5530.28 - 5538.84] P:1933.69 E:0.096929 |  England involved in only the third match against France at a World Cup group match in 1966 in the
[5538.84 - 5545.32] P:1801.54 E:0.090709 |  famous year and like Garas Southgate I raced home from school for the match in 1982 when
[5545.40 - 5552.04] P:1946.70 E:0.100604 |  Brian Robson scored after 27 seconds those pick fit takes this free kick downfield and it's out of
[5552.04 - 5559.64] P:1856.17 E:0.089480 |  play but Saka with a challenge on Hernandez foul and that is a free kick to France 10 yards
[5559.64 - 5564.44] P:1902.12 E:0.092513 |  inside their own half but McCarnell to take this it's a long one but that's going nowhere for
[5564.44 - 5570.04] P:1974.96 E:0.099215 |  France and Jordan Tickford just takes the ball into his gloves well we've got less than 20 minutes
[5570.04 - 5575.16] P:1912.98 E:0.097210 |  to play so less than 20 minutes to go until extra time yeah England on the front foot in the
[5575.16 - 5581.32] P:1885.21 E:0.096375 |  minute there's just a moment there where McCarnell hit that ball and he just had the air of desperation
[5581.32 - 5587.40] P:1895.16 E:0.099730 |  about it just hitting a long hopeful ball to Olivia Giroux who was nowhere near it still neither
[5587.40 - 5593.32] P:1930.63 E:0.094952 |  manager has made a change which is remarkable at this World Cup here's Sean the left hand side
[5593.32 - 5598.92] P:1870.54 E:0.093980 |  swings a high pass across to the back post headed away by Hernandez Henderson is on to this
[5599.08 - 5606.76] P:1976.03 E:0.106123 |  hand is news right behind him and it's out of play Rabi actually right behind him it's out of play
[5606.76 - 5612.84] P:1907.07 E:0.106153 |  Torrin is taken and then Bellingham is turned in the box by Ruben McCarnell went down and he's
[5612.84 - 5617.88] P:1888.65 E:0.094575 |  slapping the turf Bellingham that looked more hopeful to me in terms of a penalty show well he
[5617.88 - 5623.80] P:1946.04 E:0.099330 |  never actually had the ball under control up on my car nose comfortable neither of them were near it
[5623.88 - 5625.88] P:1953.93 E:0.107404 |  so it's not a clear and obvious error
[5628.20 - 5632.44] P:1964.29 E:0.103310 |  Rice steps in against Griezmann Rice stretches for the header but the ball
[5632.44 - 5637.32] P:1938.25 E:0.098752 |  does find Griezmann this time as it comes back over the halfway line and then Griezmann to Dempeli
[5637.32 - 5643.08] P:1983.34 E:0.106727 |  well it was a good ball actually from Griezmann that he got his feet on Dempeli and as a result
[5643.80 - 5648.52] P:1882.62 E:0.090500 |  been rather labored fashion couldn't get it and it was out of play for a throwing to England back
[5648.52 - 5654.68] P:1835.76 E:0.089827 |  down pitch side Juliette Larrington where Steve Holland has just told Mason Mount to go and warm
[5654.68 - 5660.76] P:1735.44 E:0.087274 |  up and in fact he has taken his bib off so it looks like he's coming up and coming on and also an
[5660.76 - 5665.64] P:1816.29 E:0.091179 |  indication is that I can see in the distance a book is being clicked through so he's going to get
[5665.64 - 5670.76] P:1787.20 E:0.091078 |  his instruction and it looks like Mason Mount is going to be making a substitute appearance for
[5670.76 - 5676.20] P:1753.32 E:0.097025 |  England in the next couple of minutes or so I can see that as one won the score France come forward
[5676.28 - 5679.96] P:1957.32 E:0.105981 |  down the right hand side he has Dempeli on the right flank pulls it back under his left foot as
[5679.96 - 5685.64] P:1874.05 E:0.094898 |  he likes to do crosses into the penalty area acrobatic clearance by Walker it comes up Tremainy
[5685.64 - 5691.72] P:1694.98 E:0.094142 |  Rabiol together on the left hand side Rabiol then goes back to Hernandez and Hernandez has pulled
[5691.72 - 5696.84] P:1878.71 E:0.102738 |  to the back post a stretch but a stretch and a header wide by Olivier Giroud goal kick England
[5696.84 - 5701.16] P:1844.05 E:0.105799 |  Mali applauses across and it's a clever cross it's a clever bit of play from Olivier Giroud
[5701.16 - 5705.96] P:1852.09 E:0.096686 |  because he knew that he wasn't going to eat John Stones or Harry Maguire so I'll tell you what
[5705.96 - 5712.20] P:1710.37 E:0.097419 |  drift a bit further and fancied with Johnson's against Luke Short who was a little bit over here
[5712.20 - 5718.68] P:1724.34 E:0.103896 |  England may be making the change first but I do feel that France are the more tired of the two teams
[5719.80 - 5728.28] P:1666.10 E:0.101943 |  68,895 here in Albate the stadium to the north next to where they used to do the the pearl fishing
[5728.28 - 5734.76] P:1638.44 E:0.094375 |  up on the coast as we've both learned in the museum of Qatar so Mason Mount coming on but not
[5734.76 - 5741.00] P:1817.35 E:0.086762 |  yet Maguire strides forward with the ball for England sure then to Bellingham lovely lovely
[5741.00 - 5745.48] P:1774.11 E:0.091698 |  control from Bellingham in the box Bellingham then back to shore sure curls it in but that's
[5745.48 - 5750.36] P:1816.97 E:0.094509 |  beyond anyone in a white shirt Hernandez heads it away and it comes out to him Batte who's got that
[5750.36 - 5755.72] P:1902.73 E:0.105873 |  lazy just look what I'm about to do to you look about him passes it forward good challenge
[5755.72 - 5763.00] P:1792.34 E:0.090911 |  though from Declan Rice it's been excellent in the game Declan Rice friends with the ball centrally
[5765.80 - 5772.52] P:1864.82 E:0.106512 |  and it's played back into central defence and then on to Griezmann and then across again
[5772.52 - 5779.00] P:1841.48 E:0.108212 |  to Rabiot who will carry it forward deep into the England half Batte slipped it in between two
[5779.00 - 5784.36] P:1867.51 E:0.110926 |  England men the cross from Rabiot to the back post D'Abele heads it across oh what a save from
[5784.36 - 5791.96] P:1978.82 E:0.113162 |  Tickford to keep out Sheree 10 yards out of the volley and Tickford diving to his left to his right
[5791.96 - 5797.88] P:1892.29 E:0.104440 |  pushes it away wider the goal and behind for a corner huge moment in the game fantastic save
[5797.88 - 5804.52] P:1855.43 E:0.115105 |  really well worked and it's the moment Olivier Sheree has been waiting for a volley on his left
[5804.52 - 5812.68] P:1888.91 E:0.110257 |  foot he's held his time in the penalty area just waiting and waiting and waiting it's a big big
[5813.64 - 5820.12] P:1866.80 E:0.104613 |  save huge on his 50th cap Tickford here's the corner though headed away then he approached for
[5820.12 - 5828.12] P:1913.22 E:0.095363 |  England by Kane comes out for Varan and it's worked to the left hand side and still up for the set
[5828.12 - 5837.88] P:2019.68 E:0.116532 |  piece here's the ball in Sheree this time 2-1 France 6 yards out super powerful centre forwards
[5838.68 - 5844.28] P:1884.03 E:0.113573 |  and England are behind the game in the quarterfinal and France are going mad England have got to
[5844.28 - 5853.24] P:1736.11 E:0.120919 |  do it all again and now time's running out England 1 France 2 it's a wonderful and it's from that
[5853.24 - 5863.64] P:1766.85 E:0.119795 |  man Griezmann right from the touch line fires in a wonderful cross and Olivier Sheree he's made
[5863.64 - 5871.48] P:1810.66 E:0.113500 |  that run a million times in his career across the near post and he's asking for that ball giving
[5871.48 - 5879.40] P:1740.04 E:0.119893 |  himself hardly out of space please just find me just find me and he does it to perfection steals in
[5880.12 - 5885.48] P:1667.58 E:0.122810 |  takes a little nick of Harry Maguire that Pete Tickford they had the warning in England
[5886.20 - 5893.64] P:1744.18 E:0.117790 |  they didn't listen they've got to do it again as you say and here's the change now Henderson is off
[5893.64 - 5900.76] P:1670.92 E:0.110894 |  Jordan Henderson makes way for Mason Mount who comes on into the midfield and Raheem Sterling
[5900.76 - 5907.16] P:1758.57 E:0.100230 |  as well is going to come on for England so a double change so Jordan Henderson is off and it is
[5907.16 - 5913.56] P:1828.65 E:0.099720 |  Bukaj Osaka it must be that problem because otherwise you wouldn't be taking Bukaj Osaka off
[5913.56 - 5920.84] P:1838.51 E:0.106494 |  the match that he's had no he wouldn't needing them now to create something so to creative influences
[5920.84 - 5928.04] P:1943.29 E:0.112340 |  out there this is a surprise though isn't it that it's Sterling and not Rashford well he's fresh
[5928.04 - 5937.00] P:1846.91 E:0.102313 |  say that having been at Holman back back down to Juliet Flarrington well it could soon well be
[5937.00 - 5941.88] P:1748.87 E:0.103829 |  Marcus Rashford making an appearance because he's now just going through a war walk on his own
[5942.44 - 5947.00] P:1765.52 E:0.103877 |  the Raheem Sterling substitution John that was a very quick substitution which was being made
[5947.00 - 5951.96] P:1808.00 E:0.097973 |  all being discussed about whilst that corner was being taken but Marcus Rashford now is doing a
[5951.96 - 5958.84] P:1915.47 E:0.086654 |  warm-up so maybe he will be England's third substitution into this game so Mason Mount
[5958.84 - 5964.36] P:1907.68 E:0.100878 |  is on having come on as a substitute in the previous match against Seneca all but I think
[5964.36 - 5968.04] P:1886.28 E:0.104832 |  Jordan Henderson the amount of ground that he's covered today I think it was almost an
[5968.04 - 5973.40] P:1871.26 E:0.101214 |  inevitability that Mount would come on for him in the midfield yep with that creativity that he
[5973.40 - 5980.92] P:1904.16 E:0.102982 |  has we Zinglin need that right now I wonder how France will approach it now with just over 10
[5980.92 - 5985.72] P:2007.02 E:0.111542 |  minutes ago here's one over the top for England oh that's a that's a strong third challenge from
[5985.72 - 5993.32] P:1965.10 E:0.110465 |  Hernandez and I mean as the run was made by Mount into the penalty area there seemed to be a shove
[5993.32 - 5999.40] P:1782.80 E:0.099459 |  on his back he went down not given and England aren't happy about that Steve Hollander's up on
[5999.40 - 6003.80] P:1874.77 E:0.106398 |  the edge of the coaching area they want the referee to have a look at that on VAR Harry
[6003.80 - 6010.36] P:1925.44 E:0.114027 |  McGuire saying the same thing Declan Rice too the referee is waiting Hernandez he came in with
[6010.36 - 6016.28] P:1973.98 E:0.113161 |  well quite a shove in the back but the body into his back and I think VAR is taking over and having
[6016.28 - 6023.88] P:1872.21 E:0.104720 |  a look at this for another possible penalty for England but it's clumsy at best and Hernandez
[6023.88 - 6031.64] P:1861.19 E:0.105076 |  has no inclination of playing the ball Mason Mount isn't anywhere near the ball himself but
[6032.28 - 6036.52] P:1834.93 E:0.104790 |  the contact is there the intent is there and he hits him clean in the back
[6038.04 - 6045.24] P:1943.27 E:0.104971 |  we're waiting we're waiting this is a huge moment England two one down France oh here's the rectangle
[6045.88 - 6051.88] P:1981.78 E:0.113794 |  and France look to the skies their players they know what's coming here Hernandez it was a
[6051.88 - 6057.48] P:1903.25 E:0.109905 |  poor challenge into the back of Mason Mount who is making his run into the area the referee now is
[6057.48 - 6064.76] P:1899.00 E:0.104671 |  out of our sight hopefully now we're seeing the pictures and that does look like a blatant shove
[6064.76 - 6072.60] P:1855.39 E:0.107864 |  in the back of Mason Mount in the area it's a gift it's a gift it is absolutely it's a disaster
[6072.60 - 6078.20] P:1904.44 E:0.101397 |  but Hernandez if this is given because Mason Mount has no chance of playing the ball
[6078.20 - 6083.80] P:1934.84 E:0.109484 |  Wilton Stamphow is standing in front of the television screen hands on his hips here he comes
[6083.80 - 6089.96] P:2023.16 E:0.116602 |  there's the rectangle again he points to the spot and for the second time in the match it's going to
[6089.96 - 6099.00] P:1948.40 E:0.119162 |  be Harry Kane against Hugo Lloris to level things up and the 82 minutes on the clock
[6099.72 - 6108.04] P:1950.64 E:0.117292 |  and tube diagram has gone with the referee to the penalty spot and I think that is suggesting
[6108.68 - 6114.92] P:1802.15 E:0.112831 |  that perhaps that could be a red card for Hernandez you know Mason Mount is in there in the penalty
[6114.92 - 6124.20] P:1936.40 E:0.110524 |  area and the referee now is now rather blatantly producing a yellow card for Hernandez well
[6125.00 - 6129.96] P:1870.37 E:0.103906 |  I don't see it denying a clear goal scoring opportunity because Mason Mount never had control
[6129.96 - 6138.20] P:1825.74 E:0.105064 |  of the ball Lloris was going to be the favorite to win it but as I said it's an absolute disaster
[6138.20 - 6145.16] P:1806.40 E:0.091533 |  for Hernandez what he's thinking why he needs to do it I have no idea it's straight in the back of
[6145.16 - 6155.08] P:1806.71 E:0.095651 |  him Mason Mount bundled over in the box we're here again penalty again and this this is now
[6155.64 - 6162.84] P:1837.85 E:0.098341 |  for Harry Kane to top the list on his own but that is a side issue what is more important here
[6164.44 - 6170.04] P:1662.17 E:0.105396 |  is that with 83 minutes on the clock now that England need this
[6170.68 - 6177.72] P:1750.26 E:0.100691 |  England need this to level up this quarter final and again it's the same routine remember how last
[6177.72 - 6184.28] P:1896.11 E:0.099989 |  time he re-spotted it and again Lloris is looking down at the ground with his hands on his knees in
[6184.28 - 6194.12] P:1892.45 E:0.103536 |  the goal and Harry Kane is not looking at him if ever England needed Harry Kane it's now time running
[6195.08 - 6203.40] P:1893.18 E:0.107786 |  out the world champions are leading this to level it up Harry Kane waits Lloris on his line
[6204.36 - 6212.04] P:1917.70 E:0.103186 |  he sent him the wrong way last time we're waiting for the whistle still waiting this needs the nerve
[6213.08 - 6218.36] P:2069.88 E:0.115702 |  of the coolest man on the field oh he's put it over the bar he's missed it
[6219.32 - 6227.80] P:2004.77 E:0.112491 |  Harry Kane has landed the ball in amongst the England fans and France celebrate as though they
[6227.80 - 6236.36] P:1921.92 E:0.110026 |  themselves have scored it remains England one France two and Harry Kane is consoled by Mason
[6236.36 - 6243.24] P:1882.70 E:0.101262 |  Mount he runs his fingers through his hair he can't believe it England can't believe it
[6244.20 - 6252.12] P:1831.87 E:0.102254 |  the golden chance to equalise has gone and France continue to lead with six minutes to play
[6253.64 - 6260.60] P:1844.32 E:0.102442 |  and that that could be decisive that moment could be the moment that sees England out of this world
[6260.60 - 6268.36] P:1805.70 E:0.099654 |  cup and Thornton is being replaced now by Marcus Rashford Robdream what a moment what a moment
[6268.92 - 6274.36] P:1718.84 E:0.108725 |  same routine that we've seen Harry Kane do so many times throughout his career
[6275.48 - 6282.04] P:1725.29 E:0.108395 |  and he just gets it wrong he hits under the ball it clears the bar by a distance
[6282.68 - 6288.04] P:1796.39 E:0.103731 |  the Reese is going the right way he's gone for the height I think he knows that the Reese is going to
[6288.04 - 6294.60] P:1871.32 E:0.092388 |  guess it he's done it so many times throughout his career for Tottenham and for England
[6294.60 - 6303.72] P:1905.33 E:0.091167 |  it's such a crucial moment well the question is is that it can England respond to that
[6304.60 - 6310.76] P:1880.56 E:0.106060 |  with only minutes left five minutes of the 90 England one France two Marcus Rashford is now
[6310.76 - 6317.72] P:1916.67 E:0.106123 |  on the field Marcus Rashford England's joint top scorer at this world cup England coming forward
[6317.80 - 6322.76] P:1959.64 E:0.104424 |  but that's that's given us a foul for France a free kick for France against Duke Ellingham
[6323.40 - 6330.44] P:1843.97 E:0.094588 |  and and clearly here France will take as long as they can Kunde is getting to his feet after
[6330.44 - 6335.80] P:1824.05 E:0.096560 |  being on the receiving end of that and France trying to wind the clock down now as you would expect
[6335.80 - 6344.84] P:1887.92 E:0.102206 |  that they would what a reprieve what a reprieve from France haven't been the best aside in the second half
[6345.80 - 6353.48] P:1692.95 E:0.110476 |  had five minutes of pressure created two chances took one and in England the opportunity
[6354.84 - 6359.08] P:1901.35 E:0.113898 |  long and forward from Laurie Spanches across the England penalty area and the choirs able to get
[6359.08 - 6366.52] P:1938.73 E:0.104048 |  there just ahead of Bappy inside the box back to Walker Walker is tricked by Laurie so that's a
[6366.52 - 6374.52] P:1864.07 E:0.098787 |  free kick to England Walker looks over his shoulders jaggers at the at the huge figure of Olivier
[6374.52 - 6386.20] P:1876.33 E:0.093331 |  Giroud so France still lead through that brilliant header from Giroud from a brilliant ball in from
[6386.20 - 6390.60] P:1854.38 E:0.102362 |  Driesman but the story I'm afraid it's going to be penalties again isn't it for England
[6391.24 - 6394.76] P:1786.07 E:0.105349 |  at a major tournament but this time not a penalty shootout
[6396.36 - 6401.88] P:1813.93 E:0.105899 |  and Harry Kane who has missed penalties that's the fourth one he's missed for England but
[6403.64 - 6410.60] P:1862.87 E:0.104171 |  the most costly there's Mason Mount is fouled on the right hand side there will be a 606 on
[6411.16 - 6418.28] P:1885.03 E:0.098500 |  five live tonight to take your calls Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton hashtag dvc 606
[6419.16 - 6426.36] P:1870.83 E:0.108830 |  and the TV highlights are on BBC one five live World Cup daily podcast as well to download in
[6426.36 - 6431.00] P:1796.55 E:0.102698 |  the morning with all of the reaction but we will get you the live interviews on from down in the
[6431.00 - 6436.60] P:1820.29 E:0.106151 |  dressing room area and at the moment those interviews are going to be downbeat downcast
[6436.60 - 6442.84] P:1872.05 E:0.096125 |  England players free kick for England still time ball headed across the box by McGuire
[6442.84 - 6447.32] P:1999.07 E:0.112108 |  clear away by France comes back to McGuire might have been stood by Kunde
[6448.04 - 6453.72] P:1966.85 E:0.103450 |  referee says no balling him with a two but that's out for a throwing a throwing for England well
[6455.56 - 6461.64] P:1836.21 E:0.099993 |  if we've seen anything in this World Cup it is injury time and there will be plenty of it so
[6461.64 - 6467.64] P:1757.08 E:0.103684 |  England just have to compose themselves don't need to rush it it's just seen them launch one into the
[6467.64 - 6477.40] P:1860.17 E:0.098557 |  box needs to back ourselves to create one big chance rice now back to Dalingham and then in field
[6477.40 - 6482.92] P:1989.10 E:0.119190 |  the Mason Mount the Mason Mount makes room for himself and shoots gracefully from 25 yards there
[6482.92 - 6487.72] P:1910.24 E:0.105146 |  were options inside the box but he liked the look of it now he went for it but it was the wrong
[6487.72 - 6493.40] P:1820.14 E:0.105100 |  decision why yeah you can see why he went for it by just thinking the reason the form he's been in
[6493.40 - 6500.92] P:1765.53 E:0.105528 |  tonight the options are there use them he just skips up in front of him high and handsome into the
[6500.92 - 6509.16] P:1876.74 E:0.104624 |  crowd but it's the same England have that belief that you'll always get one more chance in a game
[6509.16 - 6516.04] P:1779.32 E:0.097155 |  and just keep digging out the possession keep recycling it keep creating the opportunities
[6516.60 - 6522.36] P:1887.93 E:0.105628 |  by the way in the midst of all of one of those dramas France brought on Coleman for Demperre
[6522.36 - 6528.76] P:1898.10 E:0.105991 |  which is Didier Deschamps first change and now there's been a challenge by Maguire and it's a free
[6528.76 - 6533.08] P:1870.94 E:0.099122 |  kick and the it's happened in the eye line of the bench and I think that's going to be a yellow
[6533.08 - 6538.44] P:1859.59 E:0.099588 |  card for Harry Maguire it is which is England's first yellow card of this World Cup
[6541.08 - 6547.88] P:1907.91 E:0.108738 |  but goes the card now and a free kick for France is an aerial challenge he led with his arm his
[6547.88 - 6554.76] P:1906.55 E:0.104838 |  forearm on Driesman you just need to balance out the desperation to win the ball back to being
[6554.76 - 6560.92] P:1758.24 E:0.103298 |  over assertive because you know every opportunity is going to be taken kill the game slow it down
[6562.28 - 6567.96] P:1680.89 E:0.106752 |  England won France 2 the holders are going through into the semi-finals to play Morocco
[6568.84 - 6573.96] P:1850.12 E:0.090219 |  England are going out at the quarter-finals Varan long and right footed towards the edge of the
[6574.04 - 6579.00] P:1901.86 E:0.101715 |  box it's headed across and Bapé takes that down tried to turn Stoenstead a good job on him
[6579.00 - 6584.92] P:1912.79 E:0.099884 |  prevented him from doing that very very dangerous for a moment Walker then up towards Sterling who
[6584.92 - 6590.68] P:1888.49 E:0.101162 |  chested in field Sterling is on for this it's a 50-50 now Sterling goes into it with them Bapé
[6591.24 - 6595.96] P:1962.86 E:0.116980 |  the ball bounces in field France have got it back and then there's a challenge from Mason
[6595.96 - 6601.88] P:1912.23 E:0.106099 |  Mount just too much adrenaline I think in on that one too much force on Rabiot and it's a free kick
[6601.88 - 6608.28] P:1922.95 E:0.097069 |  to France on the left clever from Rabiot just got his body in the way just went down eight minutes
[6608.28 - 6619.24] P:1861.28 E:0.105216 |  Rob about a time still time still time England won France 2 so Argentina against Croatia
[6620.28 - 6626.36] P:1815.76 E:0.097102 |  and with this scoreline it will be Morocco against France the last four England
[6627.32 - 6635.16] P:1793.04 E:0.106465 |  I've got to come up with a late late show just to take this to extra time feels like a tall order
[6635.72 - 6640.12] P:1850.54 E:0.105578 |  and at the moment the taller order because Griesman standing over the ball on the left hand side
[6640.12 - 6645.48] P:1873.78 E:0.101750 |  and Griesman's free kick is headed away by Rashford on the edge of the box knotted back in by Rabiot
[6645.48 - 6652.04] P:1862.09 E:0.093798 |  England will clear through McGuire it's away from Kane in the centre circle France have got it Hernandez
[6652.04 - 6657.16] P:1926.01 E:0.109800 |  Hernandez back out to Griesman who heads it forward and Bapé is onto this he gets there ahead of Walker
[6657.88 - 6663.48] P:1915.19 E:0.108493 |  Walker stands off it any other corner flag and Bapé taking on Walker goes to the fire line
[6663.48 - 6668.60] P:1897.93 E:0.102303 |  the support coming as well and that support is good from England and from Raheem Sterling
[6668.60 - 6673.24] P:1908.52 E:0.102276 |  and Rice will carry it away but he's under pressure still in the England right back area
[6673.24 - 6679.32] P:1928.00 E:0.091270 |  this is in added time at the end of this World Cup quarterfinal up to the centre circle Kane does
[6679.32 - 6685.88] P:1998.88 E:0.105039 |  well to win the header to Rashford back to Kane now the space for Shaw white shirts are pouring
[6685.88 - 6690.60] P:1947.03 E:0.111179 |  forward for England Shaw with the cross into the back post Laurie stretching whether he got a touch
[6690.60 - 6695.72] P:1888.76 E:0.110454 |  for that or not I'm not sure he did it's a corner to England from the right Rob Green yep better
[6695.72 - 6700.60] P:1860.24 E:0.108043 |  from England just that bit of composure on the ball from Harry Kane allowed the space found the space

[7613.88 - 7621.40] P:1707.03 E:0.073259 |  to be um well they've got everything to be proud about yeah of course i think that's the the word
[7621.40 - 7627.40] P:1861.85 E:0.077086 |  i was going to use that they should be proud of their performances um in this world cup a lot
[7627.40 - 7632.04] P:1661.19 E:0.089173 |  of people talked about in the group they've not faced anyone and they can only be what's in front of
[7632.76 - 7640.92] P:1570.65 E:0.083121 |  but today i've seen a resilient england i've seen them come back from when they'd suffered
[7640.92 - 7649.16] P:1684.95 E:0.075856 |  adversity in the game um they mixed up the play at times they never gave up but it was just the
[7649.16 - 7656.44] P:1632.64 E:0.083731 |  crucial moments in the game which i couldn't get over the line um i'm proud of every single one of
[7656.52 - 7663.56] P:1713.18 E:0.084472 |  them players tonight because the game was such in the balance and when we talked to before the game
[7663.56 - 7671.64] P:1658.94 E:0.075099 |  about where's this game going to be won you know i i did say individually that the french players
[7673.48 - 7682.12] P:1681.92 E:0.076236 |  are better just because of i watched them week in week out and i think sometimes we can be
[7682.20 - 7688.36] P:1706.93 E:0.080745 |  snobby to other leagues because we watched the premier league and i don't think england necessarily
[7688.36 - 7694.60] P:1500.36 E:0.096461 |  was was the worst team today i don't i i can really say that but it's just in the moments
[7695.72 - 7701.16] P:1547.89 E:0.093241 |  they made it count and we didn't and that was a difference in the game today rob said it more
[7701.16 - 7708.44] P:1589.17 E:0.084254 |  shots more possession but goals win your games and unfortunately they couldn't put enough in today
[7708.44 - 7713.48] P:1441.98 E:0.086687 |  they got they know they've got away with them they're celebrated there like like that that was
[7713.48 - 7717.88] P:1548.69 E:0.090483 |  a win like they couldn't dream of with that penalty as they gave away that penalty and it was
[7717.88 - 7723.80] P:1478.88 E:0.093366 |  it was something they couldn't have got away with and they had two big moments in the two periods of
[7723.80 - 7729.72] P:1551.98 E:0.087883 |  play in the game where they were on top and they scored from them both now that's a sign of a really
[7729.72 - 7737.40] P:1642.17 E:0.087043 |  good side england had far more moments where they were on top and couldn't capitalise the thing is with
[7737.48 - 7743.56] P:1658.19 E:0.091677 |  the the the french player and we've got julien coming in in a minute but it's all about the big
[7743.56 - 7749.48] P:1648.51 E:0.092181 |  moments isn't it you know we can talk about how good our players have performed tonight but
[7750.20 - 7757.24] P:1665.17 E:0.092741 |  we talked about world-class players and druid was sort of swept aside he's too old he's not good
[7757.24 - 7763.40] P:1690.89 E:0.095301 |  enough for the premier league he goes over to italy has a fantastic season becomes france all-time
[7763.40 - 7769.96] P:1687.25 E:0.091574 |  gold scorer and delivers in the big moments and unfortunately we couldn't find it in our boys
[7769.96 - 7778.76] P:1624.50 E:0.090997 |  today but they still come proud of their performance as mike says uh sheela and aran has uh has joined
[7778.76 - 7787.32] P:1621.77 E:0.091855 |  us kind of snuck in slightly sleep sheetishly on the end of that row in many ways this this is
[7787.32 - 7792.52] P:1588.07 E:0.101239 |  this is probably a harder 50 minutes for you than if you'd lost where you'd have probably felt more
[7793.16 - 7797.24] P:1462.88 E:0.099038 |  comfortable comfortable sitting with us it was a horrible yeah it was a horrible second half i think
[7797.24 - 7801.56] P:1724.61 E:0.095592 |  england have been the better side i have to be honest here england were better especially in that
[7801.56 - 7806.52] P:1928.13 E:0.096482 |  second half and there was there was a moment where you were so so much better that you should have
[7806.52 - 7811.64] P:1881.12 E:0.096941 |  capitalised and you didn't and to go back to what rob said if you don't kill a team like us if you
[7811.64 - 7816.12] P:1607.90 E:0.093393 |  don't kill a team like france when you can when the when that team is on the floor then he might
[7816.12 - 7819.48] P:1683.19 E:0.106102 |  come back to haunt you and that's exactly what happened there's no way we can play that game
[7819.48 - 7824.84] P:1842.18 E:0.086949 |  another nine times and england would win nine times even even without the can penalty england
[7824.84 - 7829.64] P:1944.19 E:0.091586 |  could have won should have won that game it's just that a team like france with that kind of experience
[7829.64 - 7835.24] P:1670.62 E:0.098248 |  with the kind of players like grisman and jihru even with an mbappin no eyes no in a no in a good
[7835.24 - 7843.24] P:1608.01 E:0.088475 |  then well defended owned by walker and stones and hand the sand if you don't if you don't put us down
[7843.96 - 7849.24] P:1722.64 E:0.090277 |  then that can happen you would say as well that laryse was one of the better players
[7850.04 - 7853.32] P:1702.30 E:0.086705 |  which tells the story in itself and you turn around and say
[7855.88 - 7864.36] P:1681.93 E:0.090002 |  again it's it's you cannot fault the england team you can't it's just those moments let's um
[7865.00 - 7870.68] P:1727.47 E:0.089173 |  let's get some reaction we'll get reaction throughout the course of the evening we can now hear from
[7870.68 - 7876.76] P:1610.23 E:0.092092 |  jordan henderson you know straight after the game it's difficult to find the right words um
[7878.12 - 7882.52] P:1507.75 E:0.102050 |  i thought we'd give everything in the game you know disappointed to go one no down but i thought
[7882.52 - 7889.64] P:1540.96 E:0.091957 |  the character and the mentality to keep going in in the second half and find the equalizer
[7892.44 - 7897.96] P:1635.44 E:0.093661 |  so i can't see any more really you would give it everything and unfortunately it wasn't ever
[7898.68 - 7903.24] P:1991.65 E:0.077508 |  enough very difficult for them to do the interviews after an evening like that matt
[7903.24 - 7910.92] P:2005.53 E:0.084675 |  upson joins us as well um you've heard what rob and miker and jewels have said just just opening
[7910.92 - 7917.80] P:1975.60 E:0.084865 |  for a new you would agree would you i i would um unfortunately i mean i think england were
[7917.80 - 7924.36] P:1980.90 E:0.087060 |  were great bar the first 15 minutes i thought that it took us that long to get into the game
[7924.36 - 7929.08] P:1915.67 E:0.093430 |  in terms of believing that we're a team that could go and beat france i don't think we started
[7929.08 - 7936.36] P:1946.56 E:0.089804 |  the match like that um but then we grew into it game control got confident started to realize that
[7936.36 - 7941.64] P:1797.04 E:0.090742 |  we can match france in a lot of different ways and maybe even beat them and that's how it felt and
[7941.64 - 7946.92] P:1878.54 E:0.089823 |  it was just key moments in the game i mean i go back to to miker's point about them having better
[7947.00 - 7955.00] P:1941.59 E:0.083061 |  players than us it's almost like a they have the arrogance and the belief because they are
[7955.00 - 7960.84] P:1911.27 E:0.084699 |  serial winners on this level we're not and i think that we're kind of trying to develop that and
[7960.84 - 7965.32] P:1858.37 E:0.091233 |  trying to grow that maybe you have to actually something has to fall from you have to win something
[7965.32 - 7971.32] P:1907.42 E:0.089718 |  for it to really happen um but they've just got this edge in moments in the game where the piece
[7971.32 - 7975.48] P:1859.89 E:0.089874 |  of quality comes in there in the right place at the right time and it's clinical there's the there's
[7975.48 - 7981.32] P:1849.99 E:0.093287 |  no second chances um and i have to credit france for being outstanding at that but i thought we were
[7981.32 - 7985.16] P:2000.93 E:0.093950 |  we were brilliant on the night and it's just such a shame that we couldn't see it through i thought
[7985.16 - 7988.20] P:1838.33 E:0.093714 |  that the team were excellent i thought harry cayne was excellent forget that you know the
[7988.20 - 7993.24] P:1953.13 E:0.092169 |  goal of the panel the penalty miss i thought his contribution was outstanding i mean upper
[7993.24 - 7999.48] P:1927.69 E:0.092350 |  man khan i had no clue how to handle him um and for me the referee was was was appalling i thought
[7999.48 - 8004.12] P:1971.07 E:0.089624 |  it was terrible the referee some really bad decisions and and that didn't help either i think
[8004.92 - 8010.44] P:1883.79 E:0.084176 |  you've nailed it matt and there was a moment in the second uh at the second goal for france
[8010.44 - 8017.08] P:1953.14 E:0.081342 |  where greezman got the ball and you saw the gap that ollie jiru had and you went oh no and you
[8017.08 - 8023.64] P:1793.24 E:0.078766 |  knew that that moment that it was there for the taking we had a number of moments like that where
[8023.64 - 8028.68] P:1828.63 E:0.081458 |  jiru tell me tell me tell me if i'm wrong but probably more moments in the game where you'd go
[8028.76 - 8034.44] P:1886.83 E:0.065088 |  oh no yeah completely and we didn't yeah we didn't take it and that's that's the difference for as
[8034.44 - 8041.24] P:1961.82 E:0.085078 |  much as you say that though rum i i totally agree with what you're saying i just always felt like
[8041.24 - 8046.52] P:2010.61 E:0.088167 |  france were always in the game if england would have lifted it if they would have scored i felt like
[8046.52 - 8052.28] P:1864.83 E:0.090206 |  france could have scored as well every time i made you feel like that mike i just feel like i just
[8052.28 - 8058.20] P:1918.27 E:0.084862 |  believe and bap he he didn't have his greatest game today but when he did his little touches in
[8058.20 - 8063.88] P:2003.46 E:0.080369 |  his flicks and he created the space for others it just seemed like if they needed a goal it could
[8063.88 - 8069.96] P:1857.75 E:0.082437 |  come as well and i know england were the better team but i just think when i was watching them going
[8069.96 - 8075.08] P:1814.41 E:0.087941 |  forward i was honestly i had about 10 mini heart attacks every time and bap he was nailed the ball
[8075.08 - 8079.96] P:1958.42 E:0.087802 |  because he creates so much for the team we talked about greezman and we talked about the matchups
[8080.44 - 8086.04] P:1921.83 E:0.093758 |  no no one's been talking about greezman the performance he had today was one of the best
[8086.04 - 8091.72] P:1935.47 E:0.076268 |  performances i've seen at this world cup the ball for the for the for the second goal we're thinking
[8091.72 - 8099.08] P:1923.54 E:0.068378 |  it's red and butter for for a high maguire that's what he loves in there but it was pinpoint and we
[8099.08 - 8103.48] P:1988.95 E:0.091569 |  go back to what we said in the in the build-up as well those clutch games there you need to learn how
[8103.48 - 8109.40] P:1953.42 E:0.082811 |  to win them this is not a given you don't you don't just work up i work up quarter finals semi final
[8109.40 - 8114.68] P:1980.07 E:0.087491 |  and just against the big nation the nation that's been there before the world champions not always
[8114.68 - 8121.08] P:2009.80 E:0.082550 |  the steal and then go and win if you know almost 100 perfect in in every sense defensively offensively
[8121.08 - 8125.80] P:2058.15 E:0.088767 |  in midfield in your substitutions because i don't understand why bukayo sake came off today for
[8125.80 - 8130.44] P:1998.37 E:0.088890 |  rames telling who's been away for five days i really this one i don't think that the field is on
[8130.44 - 8134.36] P:1992.23 E:0.094128 |  south gate that's not what i'm saying but sake was one of england's best player in that second half
[8134.36 - 8138.36] P:2062.72 E:0.089370 |  he got the penalty that got you back into the game and then you took him off for someone who's been
[8138.36 - 8143.96] P:2003.06 E:0.085002 |  back in london for the last five days that didn't i didn't really get that however to win games like
[8143.96 - 8149.16] P:2009.62 E:0.080238 |  this you need to have everything almost perfect and the french were far from it but i think that kind
[8149.16 - 8154.76] P:2017.64 E:0.082881 |  of experience and the know-how helps them massively because to go back to what i said earlier when you
[8154.76 - 8160.28] P:2002.82 E:0.082924 |  miss chances after chance they believe is growing at the same time as you're missing chances and they
[8160.28 - 8164.04] P:1876.66 E:0.096613 |  think you know what they don't take their chances if we have one we will take it and that's what we
[8164.04 - 8170.28] P:1847.17 E:0.073241 |  did i think sake was injured but uh for that i don't think he got back in but i do think okay maybe
[8170.28 - 8176.28] P:1761.54 E:0.077931 |  i didn't i know we don't we don't know anyway but maybe no but he was fantastic tonight as an
[8176.28 - 8183.40] P:1909.54 E:0.080473 |  individual performance you win a tournament by like this not by being the best team but by winning
[8183.40 - 8187.32] P:1814.21 E:0.083246 |  when you aren't the best team and that's what france did tonight it was interesting that we
[8187.32 - 8192.60] P:1651.52 E:0.089080 |  were talking a lot of them before the game about that the the midfield and how they're going to
[8192.60 - 8196.44] P:1706.30 E:0.092372 |  cope with the with the defensive and those adjustments and i thought the first goal was a
[8196.44 - 8201.00] P:1798.15 E:0.091270 |  little bit of a representation of that we got a little bit deep we got torn deca and rice
[8201.00 - 8206.28] P:1523.06 E:0.094440 |  tried to make the tackle on an unbap pay and then we sat back so we weren't out high enough to get
[8206.28 - 8212.44] P:1810.03 E:0.079138 |  pressure on the ball it was a brilliant strike but i just felt that midfield we again that fine
[8212.44 - 8218.12] P:1763.92 E:0.084065 |  detail that the juniors talking about there we were just five yards off it chappers and in
[8218.12 - 8225.96] P:1929.36 E:0.071977 |  in a game like this you know what that moment of quality you get punished um that discussion
[8227.24 - 8236.52] P:1949.36 E:0.072288 |  matt though between uh experience and winning mentality and belief that they are all slightly
[8236.52 - 8243.48] P:1988.88 E:0.073603 |  different aren't they because there was there was absolutely no doubt that england believed for the
[8244.04 - 8249.80] P:1942.76 E:0.080744 |  well 100 minutes in the end there i i i never you know they were on the front foot for the
[8249.80 - 8254.76] P:1967.26 E:0.082584 |  majority of the time i know i keep going back to it but it but it feels like a very different
[8254.76 - 8261.56] P:1782.83 E:0.078917 |  defeat to me to many of the others that i've done over the last you know 20 years of going to world
[8261.56 - 8268.04] P:1770.07 E:0.067558 |  cup that that was that was a side that did believe probably until probably until we went into
[8268.12 - 8273.00] P:1825.90 E:0.084951 |  stoppage time and john stones going off and all of that i i thought they were positive but
[8273.00 - 8278.92] P:1822.28 E:0.066863 |  there's a difference there between belief and experience and and winning mentality and an
[8278.92 - 8283.96] P:1559.12 E:0.086879 |  execution of that and i think that that's something i mean i i didn't like i said i i didn't think the
[8283.96 - 8289.96] P:1791.33 E:0.077732 |  first 15 minutes we started quite high enough with that and it wasn't until after the first goal
[8289.96 - 8295.08] P:1510.19 E:0.081846 |  that i thought we'd really reacted and came into our own and then started to play with that that
[8295.32 - 8300.76] P:1769.41 E:0.074012 |  presence and that purpose and and the belief a bit more but you know i think we're talking a
[8300.76 - 8305.24] P:1640.09 E:0.089663 |  little bit about about execution of of these things so when you get into that area you work
[8305.24 - 8311.08] P:1744.48 E:0.081039 |  so hard like england did to create these chances and it's just that fine detail whether that does
[8311.08 - 8315.80] P:1546.36 E:0.082729 |  come down to like what mike is saying about the quality whether they are a bit better than us in
[8315.80 - 8321.32] P:1682.52 E:0.081140 |  certain areas and having that that quality of player perhaps it is that but both goals i thought
[8321.40 - 8325.08] P:1534.48 E:0.080435 |  defensively we could have done you know harry maguire once that ball gets played out for the
[8325.08 - 8330.12] P:1711.39 E:0.080408 |  second phase of a set piece you're only looking for a juror don't worry about anything else no
[8330.12 - 8335.80] P:1664.60 E:0.084865 |  one in the box the space doesn't matter where is he am i the right side am i physically up against him
[8335.80 - 8341.40] P:1799.50 E:0.082945 |  so he can't head the ball and just those little those little details just went the other side um
[8341.40 - 8346.20] P:1656.59 E:0.076457 |  you know it's a real shame it's a difficult difficult watch actually but that's that's
[8346.20 - 8350.12] P:1698.08 E:0.084206 |  that's matt on that just on that on the from a defender's point of view i'll bring mike
[8350.12 - 8355.32] P:1734.04 E:0.069557 |  green after either what we're taught well and i suppose it's elite sport isn't it but we're talking
[8355.32 - 8362.36] P:1833.07 E:0.075277 |  fine margins because yeah gerud to create the space for himself fantastic the ball was absolutely
[8362.92 - 8369.24] P:1821.90 E:0.082374 |  unbelievable so it it's not as if an england centre half got themselves caught under it or
[8369.24 - 8375.32] P:1768.34 E:0.085277 |  necessarily got really pulled away by by by a run everything from the french point of view was perfect
[8375.32 - 8380.04] P:1718.30 E:0.073252 |  for that goal but but chappers there's a centre back playing for him you'd expect that tonight
[8380.04 - 8385.96] P:1822.18 E:0.079150 |  wouldn't you would you expect anything different from juror or greaseman you wouldn't so so your
[8385.96 - 8392.76] P:1817.09 E:0.066753 |  position has to be absolutely spot on and you have to make that quick decision in the box to say
[8393.40 - 8397.88] P:1708.39 E:0.085266 |  where's juror where's my man like forget the space forget anyone else he's the person that's
[8397.88 - 8402.20] P:1698.85 E:0.077816 |  going to hurt us here i need to go and physically lock in against him and it's later on in the game
[8402.68 - 8407.88] P:1662.69 E:0.080980 |  however many what minute was that 78th minute nearly 80 minutes gone you know the the cut the
[8407.88 - 8413.80] P:1871.41 E:0.080203 |  focus and the concentration is all there and i think just those tiny little moments and whether
[8413.80 - 8419.48] P:1699.58 E:0.073633 |  that is tournament winning tournaments knowing how to you know we talk about that perhaps that's
[8419.48 - 8423.56] P:1754.58 E:0.093359 |  what that is in a nutshell just getting those things right and making sure you either score
[8423.56 - 8431.08] P:1844.72 E:0.056654 |  or don't concede in in those incidents like it yeah i would i would agree with with what matt's
[8431.08 - 8437.96] P:1864.58 E:0.066748 |  saying um i think you know looking at it you know when people talk about that the fine
[8437.96 - 8446.04] P:1830.90 E:0.068032 |  no margins in in football that's what juror does and that's what i was worried about in the game
[8446.04 - 8451.64] P:1859.36 E:0.078432 |  you know everyone was talking about in batting batting no you know everyone's got to focus on
[8451.64 - 8458.84] P:1861.64 E:0.067190 |  their individual battles and unfortunately and a split second and we took you know you you play
[8458.84 - 8464.44] P:1739.09 E:0.081268 |  sunday league chapters and you play regular you play that a decent decent level and you might have
[8464.44 - 8470.68] P:1869.22 E:0.070010 |  three seconds to think about when a ball comes in maguire might have a second and a half and and
[8470.68 - 8476.04] P:1834.76 E:0.086671 |  that's the the level that we were talking about and juror didn't have a good game today he stretched
[8476.04 - 8481.88] P:1822.60 E:0.077609 |  us and he tried to stay high didn't win that many headers but he comes alive in the box and
[8481.88 - 8489.00] P:1814.22 E:0.067437 |  unfortunately for maguire it wasn't really a mistake but it was just the know-how from juror
[8489.00 - 8494.68] P:1784.58 E:0.083938 |  where to be at the right time sometimes it's just that i had 15 seconds to wait for a ball to
[8494.68 - 8501.48] P:1751.36 E:0.101186 |  be a don't worry about that still not myself under underneath it on the backside with the striker
[8501.48 - 8507.64] P:1650.61 E:0.085255 |  scoring anyhow matt sorry now it mike is right because it's a it's a tiny fraction the ball
[8507.64 - 8512.84] P:1696.43 E:0.080502 |  actually comes off maguire into the goal drew heads it and then it hits it is that close to him
[8512.84 - 8519.56] P:1784.44 E:0.074680 |  that it's a half the yard of that fraction and and we are talking such fine margin on all of these
[8519.56 - 8525.00] P:1408.55 E:0.082719 |  things you know the tackle from hananda's where sure crosses the ball and you think foden's going
[8525.00 - 8531.24] P:1466.40 E:0.080559 |  to arrive and or was it sacked we think it was sacked was going to score you know tiny tiny margins
[8531.96 - 8536.84] P:1245.73 E:0.090873 |  and sometimes they go your way sometimes they don't but there must be something behind why they go
[8537.40 - 8542.92] P:1544.66 E:0.068299 |  your way more and i think that that's you know that's what we're talking about that's the kind
[8542.92 - 8551.24] P:1901.59 E:0.068061 |  of difference in that fine detail jiru is 36 years old 36 and in a game of of this caliber of that level
[8551.80 - 8557.48] P:1914.11 E:0.086740 |  iizaj to still be alive and score that goal there after 18 minutes where he's had nothing
[8557.48 - 8562.52] P:2059.01 E:0.080649 |  apart from the one just before where it's not about i think it's a good save for big first but it's
[8562.60 - 8566.28] P:1988.67 E:0.095737 |  said that you expect him to make it went with his instep he should have probably come with his
[8566.28 - 8571.64] P:1810.10 E:0.100057 |  the volley actually with you sorry are you telling it on the jiru how to volleyball i just said
[8571.64 - 8578.28] P:1795.44 E:0.081109 |  he would have explained what he did but yet with nothing almost in that game he kept believing and
[8578.28 - 8582.04] P:1903.55 E:0.093148 |  waiting for that ball to come and when grisman delivered there it was perfect and it still
[8582.04 - 8588.28] P:1953.89 E:0.078996 |  amazes me even even after all those years rob played with him i've been his friends for 12 years
[8588.28 - 8592.60] P:2036.45 E:0.076561 |  and still on a game like this where i think he might not be good enough tonight because he's too
[8592.60 - 8597.16] P:2054.35 E:0.088796 |  the opposition is too strong it's too good it would be isolated it would be this and yet he
[8597.16 - 8604.12] P:1774.38 E:0.064339 |  found a way to impact the game in that way i just find it incredible well not only that but he was
[8604.12 - 8610.60] P:1782.75 E:0.075093 |  on for the whole time at 36 having having started no he didn't start the the final group game did
[8610.60 - 8616.28] P:1699.75 E:0.079302 |  he tune his game no no yeah so having having played every other game at this woke up he does some of
[8616.28 - 8622.36] P:1731.44 E:0.078488 |  mbappe's running and pressing for him when mbappe maybe comes inside and jiru then goes out wide to
[8622.36 - 8630.52] P:1794.49 E:0.073232 |  do and and there wasn't one ball that went long towards i this ingrid center half from lorice
[8630.52 - 8635.72] P:1879.73 E:0.071560 |  that he didn't compete for i mean i know i'm slightly surprised he got player of the match because
[8635.72 - 8642.12] P:1714.16 E:0.070800 |  yeah i thought i mean i thought grisman bossed it when he needed to but as you say for a man of
[8642.44 - 8648.12] P:1779.07 E:0.077455 |  that age and his france is all-time leading male goal scorer as well and yet it still
[8648.12 - 8652.76] P:1766.04 E:0.079333 |  feels like he doesn't get the credit yeah and four years ago at the world cup that we won he didn't
[8652.76 - 8657.80] P:2011.20 E:0.084985 |  he didn't score a single goal and i think he got a love stick for it and people don't really understand
[8657.80 - 8662.28] P:2135.78 E:0.082870 |  what else he brings if they don't see him scoring which is strange but you can repeat it they still
[8662.28 - 8668.60] P:1986.61 E:0.072521 |  don't get it and for him to be here now with four goals i think after after what happened four years
[8669.48 - 8674.60] P:2009.87 E:0.078132 |  and four years older as well it's just it's just remarkable the mental strength that he had and we
[8674.60 - 8678.84] P:1946.46 E:0.084962 |  don't have to go back again to how difficult the star of his career had been because nobody believed
[8678.84 - 8683.64] P:1889.03 E:0.077734 |  him we said that already when he broke the when he broke the record but still to be there and play
[8683.64 - 8687.96] P:1868.08 E:0.088275 |  like the only time he panicked was the last the last clearance where he messed it up and then
[8687.96 - 8692.04] P:2087.67 E:0.085373 |  i led to the rashford free kick and i think you could see on his face he was like please don't
[8692.04 - 8697.40] P:1948.68 E:0.090787 |  score now because i messed up he should have hit the ball literally to south arabia not even in this
[8697.40 - 8701.80] P:1836.34 E:0.077465 |  stadium but but that's the only thing really that you can have against him tonight incredible
[8701.80 - 8709.00] P:1944.14 E:0.068868 |  difference i wonder rob as as jul says you you know him you've been in teams with him i wonder
[8709.00 - 8714.04] P:1873.88 E:0.086226 |  whether as we said pre-match with jordan henderson being at a stage of your career where you don't
[8714.04 - 8718.68] P:1867.41 E:0.088822 |  have to prove anything to anybody you've won everything that there is to win you know how
[8718.68 - 8724.44] P:1849.41 E:0.070528 |  good you are your teammates know how good you are just go and play football yeah and that's
[8724.44 - 8729.00] P:1854.09 E:0.067339 |  exactly just go and play football that's what he's done we said before that he could have stayed at
[8729.00 - 8736.20] P:1887.73 E:0.063344 |  chelsea and not played and he still made the choice to go and play because he wanted to play here
[8736.20 - 8740.84] P:1818.58 E:0.075834 |  he's a goal away from being the top scorer in the tournament now and it's remarkable that he could
[8740.84 - 8748.44] P:1892.58 E:0.066577 |  nick it off in baffled by the time the final comes and i think his longevity yes but he's just his
[8748.44 - 8755.88] P:1900.27 E:0.073386 |  willingness to keep doing the same things because he knows they're right and it's either being a good
[8755.88 - 8762.28] P:1895.87 E:0.069057 |  teammate it's either sticking in there when it's not going for you like to not or just making that
[8762.28 - 8767.48] P:1761.18 E:0.077547 |  run making the run across the near post like he has done so many times and the knowledge of how to
[8767.48 - 8773.64] P:1881.02 E:0.065018 |  do it he might not be quick in the feet he certainly is in the mind and just that moment there he said
[8773.64 - 8779.80] P:1799.61 E:0.060761 |  to him tell him go on put it there and he did and you knew what the outcome would be and that's
[8779.80 - 8785.48] P:1824.29 E:0.076942 |  what it is and that's the sign of a great striker now people may not like him people might this stats
[8785.48 - 8790.44] P:1672.03 E:0.074975 |  say he's a great striker there is here he's on the pitch he's just scored the winner in the quarter
[8790.44 - 8794.60] P:1802.97 E:0.065748 |  final of a world cup six weeks ago he's not on the squad he's not in the squad he's not on the plane
[8794.60 - 8799.16] P:1960.83 E:0.091410 |  Deshaun doesn't have him in the squad he has benzema he's got Killian he's got youngsters behind like a
[8799.16 - 8806.92] P:1906.72 E:0.075101 |  turam or colomani those kind of guys there's no and kunku but there's no leave your zero on his list
[8806.92 - 8813.16] P:1800.94 E:0.079878 |  and it's very late that i think Deshaun thought am i really gonna not gonna take him in here for
[8813.16 - 8817.16] P:1906.29 E:0.092632 |  everything that he can bring even off the bench because carin benzema would have started tonight
[8817.16 - 8822.92] P:1875.51 E:0.085157 |  had he been fit had he been with us here and yet now when we look at it it was like there was no
[8822.92 - 8827.40] P:1898.06 E:0.096729 |  way you can not bring someone like him in your squad at the world cup for all the reason that
[8827.40 - 8834.60] P:1839.06 E:0.076235 |  we've just explained on to an greaseman my cut now has 28 assists for france that's the most of any
[8834.60 - 8839.48] P:1878.63 E:0.086957 |  player for the national team over the last 50 years so he's gone ahead of tiari on re
[8840.44 - 8845.72] P:1774.62 E:0.095918 |  and zinedine zidane who are both on 26 so tiari on re's lost the goal scoring andy andy
[8845.72 - 8853.00] P:1684.61 E:0.095153 |  in the sem one good month for him terrible terrible world cup for tiari on re very terrible i'll be
[8853.00 - 8860.36] P:1864.43 E:0.103641 |  texting him after as well just pick that name up i didn't i didn't say it i just said i'll be texting him
[8861.72 - 8867.16] P:1837.30 E:0.086645 |  but no yeah i mean greaseman east east at the tempo from the first half the best player in the
[8867.16 - 8872.84] P:1931.35 E:0.086631 |  first half he got into little pockets of space he slowed it down when he needed to he released the
[8872.84 - 8878.92] P:1797.83 E:0.084941 |  ball at the right time the weight of his pass was excellent and he kept driving him on why he liked
[8878.92 - 8883.32] P:1728.05 E:0.093695 |  about you know he's worked great he picked up a yellow card i thought them belly worked really
[8883.32 - 8889.48] P:1756.00 E:0.092720 |  hard today as well but greaseman's just got a calmness when he's on the ball the way he turns
[8889.48 - 8895.96] P:1703.05 E:0.073809 |  and the way he plays excellent let's go jump in we can get some reaction to that england performance
[8895.96 - 8903.64] P:1543.59 E:0.084233 |  car walker is with john morray yes the the first man out is the the senior man in the squad actually
[8903.64 - 8908.36] P:1516.58 E:0.090401 |  who's come to speak to us kyle walker um kyle you've just come out of the dressing room there just
[8908.44 - 8916.12] P:1208.12 E:0.081977 |  gives an idea of what the feeling is obviously it's down it's quiet it's disappointment but
[8917.00 - 8923.64] P:1030.92 E:0.091287 |  as you just said there you know one of the senior ones and i've been here unfortunately before um
[8923.64 - 8928.68] P:1147.42 E:0.098492 |  for club and country where the the result hasn't gone your way and it's about you know it's about
[8928.68 - 8934.84] P:1215.89 E:0.077963 |  taking responsibility i feel that we've all done what we needed to do to get to this point we come
[8934.84 - 8939.88] P:1296.99 E:0.090985 |  against the world champions which is a good team but it's about making sure that the differences in
[8939.88 - 8945.08] P:1325.51 E:0.095814 |  both bots you know we obviously a lot of shots more than them but they scored two we lose a game and
[8945.96 - 8951.16] P:1330.45 E:0.084360 |  that's the game of football incredibly fine margins aren't there between two good teams
[8951.72 - 8957.56] P:1342.59 E:0.093656 |  i think that's the perfect way to to say it's fine margins it's a chess game um i think you've seen
[8957.56 - 8962.52] P:1179.20 E:0.096670 |  some of the results that we've seen over the last couple of days that you know it's either penalties
[8962.52 - 8967.88] P:1021.86 E:0.098507 |  or the going right to the wire um listen we would have loved to have sung in our way i think that we
[8968.52 - 8973.96] P:1050.94 E:0.093231 |  have played well there's no way to feel ashamed about how we've gone out there obviously we would
[8973.96 - 8979.32] P:879.71 E:0.099954 |  have wanted to go to the semi-final and possibly the final you know because i thought it was a great
[8979.32 - 8984.60] P:1117.23 E:0.091228 |  chance but it is what it is it's football we have to dress ourselves down and like i've just said on
[8984.60 - 8990.12] P:977.33 E:0.093816 |  the radios and tv's there it's a fantastic bunch of lads to work with that's the manager and staff
[8990.12 - 8994.76] P:1052.38 E:0.097447 |  included and the future's bright you know you got the likes of Phil Ford and Jude Bellingham
[8995.48 - 8999.16] P:1106.54 E:0.104656 |  obviously Marcus Rush was so very young you know these players have got to lead the way
[9000.36 - 9004.60] P:1183.69 E:0.104679 |  for the younger generation that's going to come through and you know we look forward to the euros
[9004.60 - 9011.32] P:1309.03 E:0.088388 |  log and tell us how Harry Kane is you have not seen him come out yet you know took responsibility
[9011.80 - 9019.32] P:1257.83 E:0.087865 |  but do you think that the fact it was Harry Kane against Loris was a factor no no not whatsoever
[9019.32 - 9026.04] P:1134.55 E:0.090663 |  i mean harry kane faces ramsdale pulp and pickford in the premier league and nine times out of ten
[9026.04 - 9030.68] P:1048.92 E:0.105474 |  he puts them away you know that's that's how he's one of harry's jobs and one of harry's specialities
[9030.68 - 9036.44] P:1228.63 E:0.091939 |  you know in penalties but he's put one in the back of the net and then you know he's put one over
[9036.44 - 9041.96] P:995.98 E:0.081399 |  it eats football would i have wanted anyone else on that penalty no not one bit i feel that he's
[9041.96 - 9048.28] P:1226.86 E:0.084483 |  proving himself and we shouldn't even be questioning him on that it's a it's a penalty
[9048.28 - 9052.12] P:1093.52 E:0.089483 |  you can miss or you can score that's the simple thing about it he's put one away in his miss one
[9052.84 - 9057.96] P:1172.22 E:0.086034 |  let's not dwell on it let's move forward i'm sure he'll be back and i know he will be back in fact
[9057.96 - 9061.80] P:1028.52 E:0.096126 |  because that's the type of character that he is and the leader it is on and off the field
[9062.36 - 9066.84] P:1281.55 E:0.086829 |  and we just look forward to the euros now kyle thanks very much for coming and talking to us thank

[9276.92 - 9282.12] P:1831.28 E:0.067281 |  hugs down there it's um it's more than just losing a football match for the friends and the families
[9282.92 - 9287.08] P:1764.25 E:0.070125 |  yeah i mean everyone wants to see their their families and i think a couple of the families
[9287.08 - 9294.12] P:1878.03 E:0.060544 |  have been out as well some for the the whole tournament and you know it's devastating you can't
[9294.12 - 9301.56] P:1903.35 E:0.077402 |  really put into words how you feel because the euros final when we went one ahead against italy
[9301.56 - 9308.12] P:1936.90 E:0.069928 |  and then we we dropped deep and the the sort of opinion was everything was too negative
[9308.76 - 9315.32] P:1922.40 E:0.072099 |  but no one can say this was negative today this is all positive and you know the group that they've
[9315.32 - 9320.52] P:1705.34 E:0.076449 |  got that being brilliant the the played the socks off the try to win the game was it meant to be
[9321.16 - 9325.16] P:1903.37 E:0.074540 |  and i just love the characters of all the players i think the interviews that they give
[9325.16 - 9332.20] P:1977.41 E:0.064758 |  the so articulate they're so helpful and you just wanted them to go that step further just
[9332.20 - 9337.72] P:1899.54 E:0.066554 |  because the role great lads but i'm sure they're all happy to uh to go home to their families now
[9337.72 - 9341.88] P:1909.67 E:0.082990 |  i just hope that people back in england don't see this as a setback this kind of of course
[9341.88 - 9346.52] P:2078.13 E:0.087253 |  is not as good as a semi-final or a final of the euros but this can't be seen as a setback
[9346.52 - 9352.12] P:1975.86 E:0.082275 |  this can't be seen maybe maybe because of where you're going to go home from the quarter finals but
[9353.00 - 9356.92] P:1817.60 E:0.093196 |  in the progression and development that we were talking with rob about before this is a learning
[9356.92 - 9360.84] P:2066.39 E:0.079292 |  this has to be part of the learning curve for what is still a very young team so it's so
[9361.80 - 9365.48] P:1745.69 E:0.086083 |  i tell you what will go back down and then we'll explore that a little bit more but kara southgate
[9365.48 - 9372.20] P:1525.82 E:0.082738 |  is now live with john yes kara southgate is here commiserations garith how are they how's harry
[9372.20 - 9382.28] P:1480.50 E:0.075061 |  ken how are you uh look the uh it's a incredibly quiet dressing room as you'd expect um what i've
[9382.28 - 9389.24] P:1369.37 E:0.073078 |  said to them is that not only have they played incredibly well against the top top top team
[9389.24 - 9396.60] P:1432.30 E:0.077231 |  tonight and gone toe to toe all the way and really deserved more from the game um but that's how
[9396.60 - 9401.96] P:1367.75 E:0.078100 |  they've been across the whole tournament and the entire squad the entire staff have been
[9401.96 - 9408.36] P:1385.65 E:0.080073 |  brilliant for me to lead um i think we've improved as the tournament's gone on i think we've shown a
[9408.36 - 9415.08] P:1407.33 E:0.073308 |  different side to ourselves than perhaps we've seen in the past um and that was shown tonight and
[9416.04 - 9425.40] P:1447.41 E:0.078864 |  yeah i can't the word's difficult because it hurts tonight it's you were years in preparing and uh
[9427.16 - 9434.76] P:1268.89 E:0.079588 |  building for a world cup and of course it's uh yeah to go out in the way we have is is really cruel
[9434.76 - 9442.68] P:1438.90 E:0.083783 |  does it almost feel unjust you know last year you finished with bukayo sake in your arms and here
[9442.68 - 9448.52] P:1398.96 E:0.080626 |  you finish with harry kane in your arms miss penalties your own history with penalties it really
[9448.52 - 9457.00] P:1254.65 E:0.083781 |  seems unfair almost doesn't it that sport yeah it's part of football and um we we are a team and
[9457.00 - 9462.04] P:1215.27 E:0.099959 |  we've won as a team and we we lose as a team and across the hundred minutes there are many things
[9462.04 - 9468.84] P:1353.96 E:0.078977 |  that were really really good and a lot of things that weren't so good and that's how the the game
[9468.84 - 9474.04] P:1209.90 E:0.089159 |  ends up with the score line that it does so it's not about one chance that was missed or one goal
[9474.04 - 9480.28] P:1411.34 E:0.079120 |  that was conceded um there's been a tremendous collective all the way through we wouldn't be
[9480.28 - 9486.28] P:1329.03 E:0.087735 |  where we are without harry's leadership and his goals frankly so i don't have any uh there's no
[9486.28 - 9492.92] P:1414.06 E:0.080561 |  recriminations in our dressing room at all and um this group with the age of a lot of them have
[9492.92 - 9499.96] P:1473.70 E:0.086929 |  shown a side that can go on and and you know continue to challenge and stay on the big stages
[9499.96 - 9503.80] P:1001.13 E:0.074340 |  we have been in the last few years yeah because people will will look at it won't they and they'll
[9503.80 - 9510.68] P:1377.16 E:0.083319 |  say they'll say semi-final final quarter final but do you do you feel that this here is the best
[9510.68 - 9516.60] P:1422.68 E:0.089293 |  that we've seen from your england team and and does does that give you that determination to go with
[9516.60 - 9523.80] P:1390.79 E:0.080604 |  them and see what you can do in 2024 i think tonight's performance against you know as good a team
[9523.80 - 9533.32] P:1266.09 E:0.086740 |  as we've faced frankly um was was fantastic to see um but in the end we're in the business of winning
[9533.32 - 9540.28] P:1325.35 E:0.078507 |  and we haven't done enough to win so for all the positive feel about the performance um you know
[9540.28 - 9547.40] P:1376.00 E:0.083063 |  we're sitting going home and uh yeah tonight that's very difficult and what will you do you'll stick
[9547.40 - 9552.76] P:1259.39 E:0.076259 |  with it yeah you'll stick with it after every tournament we've sat and reflected because you
[9552.76 - 9558.28] P:1203.15 E:0.087996 |  know these tournaments take a huge amount of energy and um tonight is not a good night
[9558.92 - 9565.72] P:1334.25 E:0.083319 |  to make good decisions um i think i think it's right for myself and the fa to to talk everything
[9565.72 - 9571.16] P:1410.18 E:0.091258 |  through because i know how that process has been after previous tournaments and you you you
[9572.44 - 9578.44] P:1286.39 E:0.087334 |  yeah you need time really um it's an important call for all of us thanks gareth thanks john thank
[9578.44 - 9586.92] P:1729.34 E:0.076218 |  you congratulations gareth savgate live with john morrie 08085 909693 rob green michael richards
[9586.92 - 9594.04] P:1908.69 E:0.070481 |  matt upson and julien loran are all with us um you heard gareth there matt talk about you know the
[9594.04 - 9600.04] P:1939.29 E:0.062027 |  past two tournaments england have played better football at this tournament than when they got
[9600.04 - 9605.08] P:1889.63 E:0.067902 |  to the final of the euro's or the semi finals of the last world cup haven't they yeah i'd agree with
[9605.08 - 9613.32] P:1842.21 E:0.059807 |  that um i would agree with with the manner in how we played has has been better um i think it's a
[9613.32 - 9620.60] P:1891.10 E:0.072004 |  team that's growing it's a team that's improving it's a group of players that to me look very strong
[9620.60 - 9626.36] P:1923.61 E:0.069109 |  together you know we have a real togetherness which is a strength on the pitch um and i think
[9626.92 - 9631.48] P:1745.30 E:0.076050 |  you've seen that in players that have come into this tournament not in great form and have played
[9631.48 - 9638.04] P:1829.13 E:0.071248 |  well you know i think we've defended well as a group and that was a real suspect area in the last
[9638.04 - 9644.12] P:1939.17 E:0.068800 |  six months and it's been it's been good it's been very good on the whole um the midfield looks really
[9644.12 - 9649.80] P:1858.93 E:0.059085 |  exciting spoke about before the game we've got great attacking options and depths of squad um
[9650.60 - 9656.20] P:1775.22 E:0.081861 |  and i think that we have played better and and we look at more convincing team it seems crazy
[9656.20 - 9659.48] P:1019.62 E:0.090716 |  because we've gone out in the quarter finals this time we haven't done as well as the last world
[9659.48 - 9665.56] P:1885.48 E:0.065281 |  cup or like you said made a final in the euros but i think there's a lot to take from this that
[9665.56 - 9672.60] P:1843.24 E:0.076844 |  show that england are moving in the right direction um and maybe it needs a lot of these experiences
[9672.60 - 9678.44] P:1747.01 E:0.074994 |  of defeat maybe negative experience to keep improving as a group and whether or not we can
[9678.44 - 9683.88] P:1659.62 E:0.086017 |  turn that into a win i hope so but there's a lot of positive there's a lot that the whole squad and
[9683.88 - 9689.32] P:1776.31 E:0.071134 |  the manager have to be really proud of if england had gone back to a back three tonight mica and say
[9689.48 - 9696.60] P:1902.54 E:0.060798 |  lost one nil or or even two one um then the criticism would would be different i think do you know
[9696.60 - 9702.76] P:1911.27 E:0.070130 |  what do you know what i mean they they've been a front foot team in bar bar the game against the
[9702.76 - 9708.76] P:1813.97 E:0.062924 |  usa really they've been a front foot team in this world cup yeah exactly that i mean we talked about
[9708.76 - 9715.32] P:1935.55 E:0.073943 |  that many times would we be negative and i don't think southgate can be accused of being negative
[9715.32 - 9720.04] P:1836.43 E:0.071788 |  it was on the front foot they took it to france and another day they could have won the game and i
[9720.04 - 9726.28] P:1963.83 E:0.067160 |  think that's why there will be a lot of positivity obviously with the missing the pen and the history
[9726.28 - 9732.44] P:1743.39 E:0.076261 |  of england football it's never nicer to miss a pen and look france might have scored another goal who
[9732.44 - 9737.64] P:1780.52 E:0.071443 |  said you know if he would have gone to extra time and england you know front still might have won
[9738.52 - 9745.08] P:1756.54 E:0.083129 |  but i don't think there can be any negatives about england at all the the only one area where we
[9745.08 - 9752.04] P:1980.64 E:0.057109 |  can improve is being potent in front of goal and unfortunately we couldn't do that today just on
[9752.04 - 9758.44] P:1889.07 E:0.068882 |  the on the experience and tournaments and history before you before you win one joules so england
[9758.44 - 9764.76] P:1936.41 E:0.074543 |  england have gone semi finals world cup final at the euros quarter finals now before france won in
[9764.76 - 9772.52] P:1975.97 E:0.074460 |  2018 you lost the final of the euros at home to portland in 2016 was the 2014 a world cup where
[9773.08 - 9778.76] P:1896.15 E:0.085433 |  france imploded or was that was that normal no it's a game that actually reminded me of this we
[9778.76 - 9783.72] P:1605.30 E:0.093883 |  lost to us germany in the semifinal in the quarter in the quarter finals that was it yeah yeah where
[9783.72 - 9788.20] P:1943.63 E:0.091509 |  france played better than germany considered goal on set pieces and that was it and the frustration
[9788.20 - 9792.76] P:1909.47 E:0.089881 |  that we had that night is the frustration that you and the players will have now for england because
[9792.76 - 9798.76] P:2097.96 E:0.082630 |  we were so close and yet we didn't just have that know-how just have that sort of clinicality and the
[9798.76 - 9804.36] P:1961.63 E:0.082777 |  the ruthlessness you know where to have won again in germany who who looked like on the page like never
[9804.36 - 9808.20] P:1977.98 E:0.086189 |  in that really and they never panicked and i don't think the french really panicked to that even when
[9808.20 - 9812.12] P:1948.44 E:0.089074 |  they were under pressure even when england were the better side and that's that's part of the learning
[9812.12 - 9818.44] P:2034.67 E:0.069679 |  curve there's one thing i would say though the the crochet game modridge and his flair ran that game
[9818.44 - 9823.32] P:1930.66 E:0.082446 |  in 2018 the final of the euros variety had a very similar role and gris man to there again and i
[9823.32 - 9827.96] P:2099.70 E:0.093998 |  think england will have to learn on how to deal with those flair players who do you not used to play
[9827.96 - 9832.52] P:1996.53 E:0.088281 |  against because they actually not that many in the promelig where all the england players play
[9832.52 - 9837.72] P:1945.38 E:0.082298 |  and also maybe what's lacking at time in the england team is that bit of flair and yeah rice
[9837.72 - 9843.80] P:1956.57 E:0.075051 |  henderson belingham are great the ringers are great maybe maybe a james madison could bring that
[9843.80 - 9849.56] P:1989.27 E:0.068469 |  bit of a bit of magic when you you don't expect it or when you expected the least i've been saying
[9849.56 - 9857.40] P:1992.88 E:0.060655 |  all tournament in terms of i think foden doesn't play centrally because he's not trusted defensively
[9857.40 - 9863.32] P:1930.78 E:0.078062 |  and gris man does is not the most hardworking he worked hard today but he give them an outlet
[9863.32 - 9868.60] P:1949.38 E:0.085220 |  and he was a different so instead of having one of our most creative players out on the wing i agree
[9868.60 - 9873.80] P:1960.38 E:0.084268 |  i would like to see him in the central to start dictating games and the gris man experiment of
[9873.80 - 9878.28] P:1951.69 E:0.089252 |  this four cup let's not forget this is a position that he never played in before three weeks ago
[9878.28 - 9882.36] P:2044.86 E:0.087850 |  and to see him perform like this against england such a strong england side in a quarter finals
[9882.36 - 9887.48] P:2045.89 E:0.082677 |  of the world cup in a new position for him shows that it can be done with the right coaching with
[9887.48 - 9892.52] P:1952.39 E:0.081687 |  the right mentality with the right players well now everybody is gris man but still and i think
[9892.52 - 9898.12] P:2057.85 E:0.078499 |  that's a bit missing at times for england because like we said in the first half it was a bit predictable
[9898.12 - 9902.36] P:1994.52 E:0.093691 |  second half was a bit different i give you that but i think a madison or a foden more central
[9902.36 - 9908.28] P:1988.64 E:0.063068 |  even mounts his best could bring that extra little thing i think matt would you go along with that
[9908.52 - 9912.12] P:1976.04 E:0.058371 |  i would i mean i'd love to see filchvoden central
[9913.80 - 9919.56] P:1932.85 E:0.086609 |  and actually matt in the first half when he did for the last 10 minutes so he just started to drift
[9919.56 - 9925.56] P:1828.39 E:0.075222 |  a bit yeah yeah he came inside the pitch and i just think he's got this ability to twist and turn
[9926.12 - 9931.80] P:1719.23 E:0.077687 |  and to find those passes he's clever on the edge of the 18-yard box in terms of lifting balls over
[9931.80 - 9936.84] P:1764.67 E:0.076596 |  players threading passes through exactly what what jules is talking about there that that little bit
[9936.84 - 9942.92] P:1799.81 E:0.075646 |  of creative creativity and magic is being performed in front of the 18-yard box as opposed to wide on
[9942.92 - 9948.68] P:1843.80 E:0.069246 |  the wing um and for me that makes it a little bit more potent and i think that seeing him in that
[9948.68 - 9953.00] P:1700.33 E:0.087812 |  right i would just like to see him play there more just to just to get the feel of what that looked
[9953.00 - 9958.20] P:1850.32 E:0.075429 |  like or whether or not it did cost us out of possession and defensively we didn't look as good
[9958.20 - 9963.32] P:1500.08 E:0.083589 |  a team as what we would if say henderson was in the midfield and belligan was slightly deeper
[9964.04 - 9969.64] P:1892.24 E:0.065304 |  i don't disagree with anything anybody's saying but i do point out that gree greezman was very
[9969.64 - 9974.36] P:1733.39 E:0.096662 |  wide on the wing when he crossed it for the winning goal which was a big he was a corner before so he
[9974.36 - 9979.48] P:1648.72 E:0.097354 |  was wide from the corner that we can still provide magic moments from the wing true true and for
[9979.48 - 9984.52] P:1950.41 E:0.086421 |  fordonded he's got a few assists from from the wing of course but in terms of we're talking more about
[9984.52 - 9990.92] P:1939.42 E:0.070717 |  dictating the pace of of the game and i think him in that central area would have more the impact
[9990.92 - 10001.32] P:2018.42 E:0.043483 |  going forward um on the penalty on the miss penalty rob is it just one of those things is
[10001.32 - 10007.40] P:1772.92 E:0.076086 |  there an element of it being against your club goalkeeper and taking a second penalty against him
[10008.28 - 10013.72] P:1805.59 E:0.068060 |  in the game i mean only harry cayne will be able to tell us i suppose no why you're asking me well
[10015.16 - 10019.72] P:1689.02 E:0.095937 |  i did think that i'd be happy about really but you know just i'd keep going with it and hopefully
[10019.72 - 10025.72] P:1816.87 E:0.077494 |  you'll feel a bit of time with it answer no i do think that there is an extra bit of something in
[10025.72 - 10032.36] P:1825.98 E:0.059386 |  there with the the second penalty the fact that it was against lorise's buy and buy i do think
[10032.36 - 10037.16] P:1744.46 E:0.077256 |  that second penalty around is a little bit harder because the mind games are that bit more and you
[10037.16 - 10045.72] P:1935.42 E:0.071927 |  saw like you saw how far and hard lorise went into his dive and he was so convinced at this moment
[10045.72 - 10049.08] P:1630.57 E:0.080532 |  and it was something that i don't know whether harry cayne had thought about or whatever but he
[10049.08 - 10056.28] P:1850.19 E:0.059358 |  went that he decided to go a little bit higher and yes boy it went a lot higher grini would you
[10056.28 - 10062.28] P:1842.60 E:0.088202 |  have anticipated that okay that would you have died you have to dive that side knowing where harry
[10062.28 - 10067.00] P:1635.09 E:0.086193 |  cayne likes to put his penalties and he went the opposite side to the first one there's only one
[10067.00 - 10073.08] P:1758.90 E:0.070470 |  way lorise was going to dive on that second one no i think having having lorise dived the wrong way
[10073.16 - 10077.56] P:1730.05 E:0.084262 |  there was only one way that lorise could go then because if he'd have dived the same way
[10077.56 - 10082.04] P:1746.74 E:0.079691 |  i did it in a game where i dived the same way three times on a penalty that was retaken
[10082.04 - 10088.28] P:1822.35 E:0.087814 |  twice and got the wrong way every time and it looked ridiculous it looked ridiculous to tell
[10088.28 - 10093.40] P:1754.32 E:0.101935 |  her what you're doing you just watched two of them go that way but well he's got to go what the other
[10093.40 - 10101.56] P:1801.74 E:0.075693 |  way wants but i do yeah but i was desperate and i'm captain hindsight here it you're desperately
[10101.56 - 10105.40] P:1801.00 E:0.075743 |  saying just go down the middle go down the middle the one thing lorise was not going to do with
[10105.40 - 10111.16] P:1913.63 E:0.075925 |  standstill but we're going to talk about the referee yeah we'll do it let me just say something
[10111.16 - 10116.12] P:2079.61 E:0.069521 |  quickly the first frankfurt game in the champions league harry cayne scored the first penalty he's
[10116.12 - 10120.84] P:1937.09 E:0.085992 |  got a second penalty late he takes it and blasted over the bar exactly the same way and i do wonder
[10120.84 - 10123.48] P:1830.31 E:0.090104 |  i'm not saying that he can't take two penalties and score them in the same game that's not what i'm
[10123.48 - 10128.60] P:2104.84 E:0.076750 |  saying however that's two games now in the same season in the space of two months or something
[10128.60 - 10133.72] P:1975.23 E:0.083680 |  where clearly the second penalty and that game i mean suppose we're three two up so it was the
[10133.72 - 10138.44] P:1964.97 E:0.075859 |  ninth-jet many or something they still won the game it's not it's not the same caliber tonight
[10139.16 - 10143.00] P:1666.62 E:0.095241 |  but there might be something in there that second penalties which i think for everybody
[10143.00 - 10148.12] P:1903.34 E:0.065921 |  must be quite hard to take and we will talk about the referee and we'll do that after we hear from
[10148.12 - 10153.96] P:1760.08 E:0.067577 |  harry maguire with kelly summers harry i imagine that's incredibly difficult to take what's the
[10153.96 - 10159.40] P:1353.45 E:0.072042 |  manager has just said to you in the dressing room in there yeah he's just said it's difficult to take
[10159.40 - 10166.36] P:1111.27 E:0.072120 |  like he've just said he's really proud of us what he's asked of us tonight in a big occasion on a
[10166.36 - 10175.08] P:1170.58 E:0.072589 |  big stage against a good team we delivered we've dominated the game really we've dominated the ball
[10175.08 - 10181.32] P:1079.10 E:0.081960 |  we've dominated the chances we've had all the pressure and this is tournament football you can
[10181.32 - 10186.60] P:1187.23 E:0.093482 |  find yourself on the end of a result because of they've been clinical in two moments and
[10187.88 - 10194.76] P:1034.83 E:0.092630 |  we haven't so this is this is why there's so many upsets and why tournament football everyone
[10194.76 - 10201.24] P:949.19 E:0.080555 |  loves because anything can happen and but we know that we've played well tonight but ultimately not
[10201.24 - 10206.52] P:1199.30 E:0.098437 |  well enough we saw you all rallying around you caps in harry kane at the end what's he been like
[10206.52 - 10211.88] P:1351.66 E:0.082938 |  in that dressing room too well we all know he's a big character he's our leader he's our captain
[10212.44 - 10219.56] P:1203.96 E:0.088531 |  we follow him he's been magnificent ever since i've stepped into this ever since i've stepped in
[10219.56 - 10226.84] P:1334.99 E:0.085844 |  to make my debut for for my country he's been here he's been the leader he's welcomed me and he'll
[10226.84 - 10231.88] P:1370.08 E:0.089503 |  pick himself up he's a world-class striker and when you're taking as many penalties as he does
[10231.88 - 10238.52] P:1347.56 E:0.090630 |  throughout the season he's going to miss us so it'll be hurt it'll be disappointed as as are all of us
[10240.12 - 10245.00] P:1350.12 E:0.096028 |  of course of course we're not looking at and blaming age at all he's he's our tallies man he's
[10245.00 - 10251.00] P:1351.38 E:0.088944 |  he's got us out of trouble so many times in the past and ultimately we we wasn't clinical enough
[10251.00 - 10255.00] P:1314.72 E:0.082955 |  throughout the game not just not just stage with his penalties those two penalties were decisions
[10255.00 - 10260.52] P:1139.47 E:0.073324 |  you did get from the referee but what did you make of his performance overall really poor very poor
[10261.48 - 10269.00] P:1328.11 E:0.081520 |  from minute one five six fouls in the first 15 minutes not one yellow card for me it's a foul
[10269.00 - 10277.80] P:1146.19 E:0.080549 |  for the first goal leading up to to bichaya um i can't really go into explain how bad his performance
[10277.80 - 10285.16] P:1305.52 E:0.074718 |  really was um but yeah i don't want to go into too much because i'm getting fine but it was really
[10285.16 - 10290.12] P:1272.07 E:0.088532 |  really poor his decisions throughout the game not just the big decisions but even though the big
[10290.12 - 10293.72] P:1287.95 E:0.084586 |  decisions were wrong you never give us anything but yeah throughout the game it was really poor
[10295.40 - 10301.96] P:1706.34 E:0.079393 |  well there you go matt upson that that starts the discussion on the referee doesn't it well nicely
[10301.96 - 10306.68] P:1435.69 E:0.099078 |  chappers if i'm honest and i'm i'm happy i won't get fined and i'm happy to go into a bit bit more
[10306.68 - 10314.68] P:1788.34 E:0.061144 |  detail um it arigua spot on i thought he was appalling the referee some of the the the fouls
[10314.68 - 10319.48] P:1823.00 E:0.079831 |  right in front of his face that were going on and they were genuine attempts for the ball
[10319.48 - 10325.16] P:1705.85 E:0.079695 |  but just missed time tackles or clashes or legs coming together um you know we can go back to the
[10325.16 - 10329.96] P:1596.41 E:0.073942 |  the one on sacca before the goal that that one's a little bit in the balance i think it's there's
[10329.96 - 10334.84] P:1678.01 E:0.071370 |  contact um perhaps that one but but there was another one on sacra in the second half right in
[10334.84 - 10340.28] P:1739.73 E:0.083334 |  front of him we got a sandwich between two players and clearly tripped nobody won the ball play on
[10341.48 - 10348.04] P:1743.63 E:0.061996 |  that the harry came with uppermint carnaugh on on the penalty shout i mean i don't know if anyone
[10348.04 - 10353.24] P:1606.37 E:0.092459 |  else has got a view on it but i kind of understand well the only that's not a foul the only thing we
[10353.24 - 10359.32] P:1689.13 E:0.069883 |  thought matt and still still on these monitors we've only had one we haven't actually had a replay of
[10359.32 - 10365.72] P:1880.25 E:0.076477 |  it was to was to think var must have decided that the initial contact was outside the box but we were
[10365.72 - 10371.16] P:1878.44 E:0.077658 |  told by them you bring it back to a free kick yeah but we were told by we can't you can't do that with
[10371.16 - 10378.36] P:1911.79 E:0.075063 |  the ar can you you could only give it as a penalty or not a penalty but um but itv said to us that they
[10378.36 - 10384.28] P:1777.73 E:0.070911 |  thought they thought it was on the line and it was it was a penalty so i thought the lack of uh the
[10384.28 - 10392.28] P:1921.21 E:0.064463 |  lack of showing was pretty damning on the replays and in its uh it's guilt and its omission omission
[10392.28 - 10399.08] P:1755.89 E:0.070720 |  really and so yeah i think there there was there was a number in there decisions that were baffling
[10399.08 - 10405.08] P:1867.80 E:0.072851 |  and decisions that weren't made that really did need to be and and that's not an english thing i mean
[10405.08 - 10409.64] P:1770.33 E:0.090197 |  you're you're nodding as well here yeah there were there were tackles that looked fine that you gave
[10409.64 - 10416.28] P:1986.97 E:0.066589 |  free kicks for there were there were blatant fouls that he that he played play on his judgment seemed
[10416.28 - 10420.76] P:1875.33 E:0.074894 |  suspect at that time i mean he wasn't as bad as last night's one but i mean no i mean but i was
[10420.76 - 10425.08] P:2120.55 E:0.092060 |  going to say last night even in the portuguese the portugal morocco game i think there was a few
[10425.08 - 10429.08] P:1817.34 E:0.100357 |  things that was a bit dodgy last night certainly as well so a lot of players now complaining about
[10429.08 - 10433.80] P:2174.89 E:0.084480 |  referees which is not good there's one on sacca in the second half just on the 30 yards almost 30
[10433.80 - 10437.56] P:1953.43 E:0.084087 |  yards from the front he doesn't give that one which is a blatant one and then after that i think
[10437.56 - 10441.80] P:1890.51 E:0.093586 |  there's just a push on rabbiou and he gives that for france and i was even me i was like come on man
[10441.80 - 10447.24] P:1507.27 E:0.087882 |  come on that's the one that's the one i remember yeah and i think even the the penalty were mason
[10447.24 - 10453.80] P:1795.10 E:0.066122 |  mount i mean he had to put that in that that was to me quite a clear foul real time um
[10454.60 - 10459.64] P:1881.13 E:0.086738 |  could that be a red as well or not because i'm not sure man can get to the ball so i can understand
[10459.64 - 10464.04] P:1747.49 E:0.077771 |  the foul and the penalty but red i think would have been would have been harsh yeah it wasn't
[10464.04 - 10469.64] P:1660.10 E:0.077422 |  he wasn't denying the goal scoring opportunity he has to have the ball under control or be within
[10469.64 - 10475.24] P:1799.86 E:0.060319 |  reach of the ball and he was neither so that wasn't a red but yeah it was it some of it was just
[10475.24 - 10479.80] P:1771.14 E:0.077019 |  mystifying i mean i didn't see enough of the portugal morocco game to know whether the referee was
[10480.44 - 10486.76] P:1848.82 E:0.063747 |  was poor or not but michael what you would say is up until the quarter finals in the main we've had
[10486.76 - 10491.40] P:1732.30 E:0.075977 |  some very good refereeing performances and actually the games have been good because of it and now
[10492.68 - 10496.52] P:1833.59 E:0.070777 |  we've had we well certainly in the two evening games the last two days they've been iffy
[10497.32 - 10501.80] P:1740.69 E:0.082985 |  yeah they've been flowing nice um the referees have been really good to be honest but yeah
[10501.80 - 10508.44] P:1931.51 E:0.075716 |  over the last couple i think in group games it's not as intense you know once you get out the group
[10509.00 - 10517.48] P:1915.17 E:0.072512 |  and it's not that's when you know the decisions are a little bit erratic and if you noticed as well
[10517.48 - 10522.28] P:1961.13 E:0.085872 |  both benches every time there's a decision they was up you didn't see so much of that in the group
[10522.28 - 10527.72] P:1902.67 E:0.056513 |  games and they're just a little bit more under pressure do you think there's referees here
[10527.72 - 10533.72] P:1744.39 E:0.069758 |  in the quarter finals eyeball in the final to say well hold on a minute if i make my mark here
[10534.36 - 10541.32] P:1832.38 E:0.056692 |  and make a show of myself and make a name for myself here then i get the final yeah i mean
[10541.32 - 10545.72] P:2104.91 E:0.089322 |  certainly obviously your team cannot be still in the competition for you to go so the brazilian
[10545.72 - 10551.24] P:1951.14 E:0.089631 |  referee tonight of course mateu laos last night i mean he can't last last night he needs to go on
[10551.24 - 10556.28] P:1739.81 E:0.099292 |  holidays he needs to go on holidays there's nice places around here he can go to Dubai on holidays
[10556.28 - 10560.20] P:1853.73 E:0.098397 |  if he wants he can't referee again but but yeah rob is right at some point those kind of referees
[10560.76 - 10567.16] P:1974.53 E:0.059629 |  will be thinking okay my team is 90 more in tournament i've got a shout uh mica final thoughts
[10569.00 - 10576.36] P:1922.58 E:0.065870 |  yeah i mean positive positive obviously it's it's a disappointing night for for everyone um
[10576.36 - 10583.48] P:1978.70 E:0.063858 |  but i think the the boys can hold their heads high you want to see them finishing them chances but
[10583.48 - 10589.56] P:1898.20 E:0.061728 |  all in all you know the way they approach the game the way they never give up yeah they can
[10589.56 - 10595.32] P:1806.51 E:0.056731 |  proud of their performance tonight matt yeah i completely agree with mica i think it's you know
[10596.04 - 10602.04] P:1777.79 E:0.076574 |  it's so so disappointing to watch and the feeling after another defeat and knock out stages of a
[10602.04 - 10606.68] P:1786.23 E:0.085211 |  tournament but i just think england have done you know that produced so many good things across
[10606.68 - 10612.84] P:1837.38 E:0.077458 |  this tournament in many different ways you know the the squad is together the team's positive
[10612.84 - 10617.72] P:1569.96 E:0.085009 |  we've gone out in a in a manner that you can look at and go we really had a go tonight and
[10617.72 - 10621.64] P:1590.23 E:0.087459 |  and it's one of those things the fine margins we spoke about but really proud of of the of the
[10621.64 - 10628.04] P:1969.38 E:0.060157 |  players and you know they should be proud of themselves that's as emotional rob a set of
[10628.04 - 10633.96] P:1934.24 E:0.066999 |  interviews that we've had actually after recent losses i i because you know what it feels to me
