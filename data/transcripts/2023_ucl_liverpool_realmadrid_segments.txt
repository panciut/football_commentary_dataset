[0.00 - 14.96] P:1612.32 E:0.102272 |  So the pre-match formalities are completed and we're ready for the start of the first leg of this round of 16th
[14.96 - 20.60] P:1475.98 E:0.108556 |  tie in the Champions League. Liverpool with Alison in goal, Alexander-Arnold Gomez,
[20.60 - 26.80] P:1534.45 E:0.111159 |  Van Dyke and Robertson, Henderson Fabinho and Bayt Cetic, Salah Gatot on the fit, Darwin Nunez
[27.40 - 31.00] P:1609.00 E:0.108051 |  and Real Madrid with Courtois in goal, the man of the match in the final last season,
[31.00 - 39.40] P:1608.36 E:0.103069 |  Carvajal, Militão, Rudiga and Alaba, Calverde, Camarvinga and Modric, Rodrigo Benzema and Jr.
[39.40 - 46.16] P:1509.07 E:0.105597 |  So Karen Benzema is fit and Venetius Jr. who like Benzema has scored 16 goals this season,
[46.16 - 52.40] P:1470.66 E:0.108351 |  one of the real danger men in this quality Real Madrid side. The teams are ready, Liverpool
[52.40 - 60.12] P:1489.07 E:0.114446 |  in the all red with the white trim, Real Madrid their first choice colours as well,
[60.12 - 66.48] P:1614.41 E:0.108174 |  the famous all white and it's Real Madrid who kick off and immediately fire the ball forward,
[66.48 - 73.24] P:1645.00 E:0.105009 |  Boosfer the former Chelsea man Antonio Rudiga as he gets his first touch and Real Madrid with
[73.24 - 79.28] P:1731.39 E:0.103499 |  the ball in their own right back area. Liverpool playing from right to left in the first half so
[79.28 - 85.48] P:1663.27 E:0.097328 |  towards the Anfield road end defending the Cop and it is Real Madrid in possession inside
[85.48 - 90.88] P:1601.80 E:0.104424 |  their own half, the whistles, Real Madrid in possession in the early stages of this as the
[90.88 - 96.24] P:1551.85 E:0.102953 |  ball is cleared by Courtois from the ground to the halfway line, Venetius tries to get away
[96.24 - 101.92] P:1493.43 E:0.098062 |  from Alexander-Arnold, the Joe Gormas is there to collect possession and see it back to Alisson
[101.92 - 105.96] P:1483.59 E:0.104378 |  and Liverpool have it but it actually spun up against Andy Robertson down there halfway inside
[106.48 - 111.72] P:1523.97 E:0.104921 |  and bounced off him out of play for a throw into Real Madrid down the right hand side so
[111.72 - 122.08] P:1431.33 E:0.103263 |  it is a throw in to the visitors from the Spanish capital and they take the throw back into their
[122.08 - 128.88] P:1488.75 E:0.095893 |  own half where Militão will just with his right foot see it back to Courtois out to Camarvinga
[128.88 - 134.92] P:1721.37 E:0.091600 |  part of the French World Cup winning squad, this young man with such a bright future playing in
[134.96 - 140.20] P:1697.14 E:0.104197 |  the centre of the midfield and then Militão wins the throw in off Courtois Gatpo, he will be
[140.20 - 145.00] P:1643.19 E:0.100419 |  keeping an eye as well Alan Shearer on just how fit Darwin Nunes appears to be a shoulder problem
[145.00 - 149.20] P:1618.41 E:0.111800 |  as Camarvinga is caught in possession, Henderson through to Gatpo, he slipped at the crucial
[149.20 - 153.80] P:1605.37 E:0.097249 |  moment, he was almost through into the box and he seemed to be checking back from the position
[153.80 - 157.00] P:1553.76 E:0.102185 |  that he was in inside the area when he slipped. I think he was just trying to get it onto that
[157.00 - 161.40] P:1678.92 E:0.103408 |  right foot just to open the goal up to see more of the goal and put himself in the middle of the
[161.40 - 163.40] P:1673.46 E:0.089911 |  goal, he actually slipped when he did that.
[167.40 - 171.28] P:1840.53 E:0.094709 |  Well there's no surprise with the reaction of this crowd before the game it's inevitable you're
[171.28 - 174.84] P:1709.69 E:0.092412 |  going to see a quick start from these Liverpool players and that's exactly what happened.
[174.84 - 180.84] P:1703.47 E:0.091182 |  So the former England captain Alan Shearer with us here at Anfield High, very high in the main
[180.84 - 186.00] P:1668.25 E:0.092122 |  stand just above and to the right of Jürgen Klopp who's down there already directing his troops
[186.60 - 191.96] P:1743.76 E:0.094535 |  and Stoke have equalised against Swansea in the championship, Josh Laurent with the equaliser
[191.96 - 199.28] P:1661.79 E:0.088329 |  so it's Swansea 1, Stoke 1, quite a busy night tonight so we'll keep you across all of the top
[199.28 - 203.96] P:1675.35 E:0.094146 |  matches and Rotherham have taken the lead against Sunderland, Oliver Rathbone scoring, Rotherham
[203.96 - 207.04] P:1674.86 E:0.102551 |  1, Sunderland 0, Real Madrid playing the ball in from the left hand side there,
[207.04 - 211.28] P:1682.99 E:0.082996 |  Allisland all in black tonight, able to come out and catch the bouncing ball into his chest.
[211.84 - 215.36] P:1739.77 E:0.092644 |  The Liverpool players are full of energy out there, they're trying to close down as quick as
[215.36 - 220.80] P:1632.83 E:0.086885 |  possible and react to this crowd. So it's back to Allisland, takes a touch on the edge of the box,
[220.80 - 228.16] P:1696.04 E:0.084735 |  it's Modric who is there, closing him down but Liverpool pass it out from the back and Alexander
[228.16 - 234.32] P:1729.92 E:0.094214 |  Arnold who was if you remember rather caught out by Venetius Jr in the Champions League final
[234.32 - 238.88] P:1663.98 E:0.104117 |  in France last season, turns, plays it up through the middle, the gap talk comes back to Jungvijj
[238.88 - 244.00] P:1802.64 E:0.101110 |  Tjernic, big night for him, the 18 year old, now it's on the right hand side with Salah,
[244.00 - 249.28] P:1805.46 E:0.112935 |  Salah approaching the penalty area, slips the ball into the box, afflicts from Nunez,
[249.28 - 257.28] P:1760.97 E:0.121170 |  what a goal, Liverpool in front early against the holders and what a huge finish that was,
[257.28 - 265.44] P:1659.02 E:0.118171 |  past fit to play, he looked fit to me when he put that in the net, Liverpool 1, Real Madrid there.
[265.92 - 271.20] P:1636.52 E:0.114205 |  Well what a goal, what a finish, it's started by Tjernic having the confidence and the belief to
[271.20 - 276.88] P:1698.44 E:0.110251 |  switch it out to the right hand side and then Salah whips that ball in on the run of Nunez and
[276.88 - 282.16] P:1712.34 E:0.099178 |  then the little flick, I said it was going to be a quick start from Liverpool, I didn't expect this quick.
[284.00 - 288.80] P:1746.30 E:0.115332 |  Just one drink in my mind whether there might be an offside issue with that
[289.92 - 294.48] P:1659.67 E:0.117975 |  and we're just seeing it again now, no he's onside, he's onside, I'm actually looking at
[294.48 - 298.16] P:1724.91 E:0.114832 |  a different television to you Alan, you've not seen it yet. I think I'm about two seconds
[298.24 - 303.12] P:1628.99 E:0.109460 |  behind you on my TV, what a ball in, what a ball in from Salah from the right hand
[303.12 - 308.88] P:1682.74 E:0.107783 |  side with his left foot, he whips it in and it's about timing of the run from Nunez and he did it perfectly.
[310.24 - 315.84] P:1801.97 E:0.109413 |  Oh lovely, we're just seeing it again as it comes in low from the right hand side from Salah and I
[315.84 - 321.76] P:1741.89 E:0.107338 |  think it was a great pass into his path and Nunez running across it from left to right inside the
[321.76 - 329.20] P:1702.62 E:0.102790 |  penalty area, what does he send the yards out, there's a leap and with his right heel as it bounces
[329.20 - 335.28] P:1757.19 E:0.095103 |  it's a flick with the inside of his right heel beyond Kuatra and into the net. It's a fantastic goal,
[335.84 - 341.36] P:1673.18 E:0.101896 |  it really is, everything about it, the pass in from Salah, the timing and overrun and then
[341.36 - 345.36] P:1761.40 E:0.095647 |  together get the connection as he did with that right foot, what a goal, what a start.
[346.00 - 355.04] P:1603.05 E:0.115169 |  Liverpool won Real Madrid 0 and that's quite a goal, if you can get yourself into a position where
[355.04 - 361.28] P:1562.38 E:0.106366 |  you can see that at some point over the course of the next few hours and that's raised the
[361.28 - 368.24] P:1627.80 E:0.093737 |  roofs inside Anfield including the one that's not quite finished yet at the Anfield road end,
[368.24 - 375.60] P:1636.01 E:0.089077 |  ball in for Liverpool to the edge of the box that Salah turned provider and Nunez,
[376.08 - 381.44] P:1686.67 E:0.088341 |  you know there was a question over whether he's going to be able to play as Real Madrid come
[381.44 - 387.04] P:1812.19 E:0.102049 |  forward with a ball from the right hand side from Rodrigo, it's Venetius Jr now on the left hand side,
[387.04 - 392.48] P:1844.52 E:0.099335 |  a flick from Rodrigo back to Modric, Modric into the D on the edge of the area, Valverde was there
[392.48 - 396.96] P:1715.47 E:0.104644 |  as well, Modric couldn't get there and Liverpool were able to clear, well this is quite a start,
[397.52 - 403.92] P:1751.83 E:0.084953 |  Stoke are now 2-1 up at Swansea, Josh Lauren scored again so Swansea won Stoke 2 and that
[403.92 - 412.56] P:1617.39 E:0.090707 |  goal from Darwin Nunez in the fourth minute, so opening goal on Saturday at St James's Park,
[413.28 - 419.68] P:1501.00 E:0.098768 |  opening goal on Tuesday night here at Anfield against Real Madrid, it's not a bad double that,
[419.68 - 424.40] P:1600.94 E:0.099997 |  Alan? It's not bad at all, it's amazing isn't it when you're finding goal scoring so hard to come
[424.40 - 427.76] P:1728.39 E:0.102649 |  by and all of a sudden you get one and then another one comes straight away.
[428.48 - 435.68] P:1549.11 E:0.109885 |  12 for the season for Darwin Nunez, that's his fourth in the Champions League and remember Liverpool
[435.68 - 441.28] P:1644.32 E:0.099630 |  who started this Champions League campaign losing 4-1 away against Napoli, here's Fabinho
[441.28 - 445.60] P:1695.22 E:0.110673 |  to the edge of the penalty area, Camargo Vinga with a challenge, Fabinho fell into the box,
[445.60 - 451.12] P:1758.32 E:0.094014 |  referee Corbache says that was a clean challenge by Camargo Vinga and Benzema then with the flick
[451.20 - 457.12] P:1795.92 E:0.106666 |  for Venetius Jr, the Gomez is in, go with him shoulder to shoulder with Venetius Jr and actually
[457.12 - 462.16] P:1715.51 E:0.092469 |  beat him to the ball and play it back to Alisson, that epitomizes the strong start that Liverpool
[462.16 - 467.12] P:1660.27 E:0.093543 |  have made. That was a vital tackle that was from Joe Gomez, him and Venetius going 1v1 and he just
[467.12 - 472.96] P:1597.71 E:0.084662 |  nudges him away off the ball, showed great strength there to get to it first. So Liverpool,
[474.00 - 480.64] P:1593.75 E:0.098007 |  great noise already before that goal went in and it's obviously a smoke bomb, a red smoke bomb
[480.64 - 486.88] P:1539.46 E:0.090569 |  has gone off because the, I can see that pale red smoke now just drifting up to the roof of the
[486.88 - 494.40] P:1522.79 E:0.083157 |  cop and then out the front of the stadium at the top and there goes rectangular red scoreboards,
[494.40 - 502.40] P:1549.88 E:0.093399 |  now read Liverpool FC 1, Rayon Madrid 0, 7 minutes on the clock, after all those chances they had in
[502.40 - 508.40] P:1505.04 E:0.095465 |  the Stade de France at the end of last season, couldn't beat Thibault Courtois, looking back at
[508.40 - 514.24] P:1550.82 E:0.100912 |  it Alan, some of the saves, you know, he said it at the time but when you see it again, remarkable
[514.24 - 518.88] P:1629.53 E:0.101541 |  really and that's why it was torture for Jurgen Klopp I guess to watch it at the weekend.
[519.52 - 525.04] P:1581.91 E:0.097531 |  And Alaba loses possession on the far side, Salah puts his foot on the ball, Salah who scored in
[525.04 - 530.16] P:1583.70 E:0.098430 |  his last five Champions League appearances, the last five group matches, played forward by Henderson,
[530.16 - 535.84] P:1687.03 E:0.093003 |  Salah into the box now and he's shrugged off the ball, excellent defending from the experienced
[535.92 - 542.96] P:1685.72 E:0.100699 |  Alaba to go with him, come out with the ball then Venetius Jr who was blocked by Fabinho but he knew
[542.96 - 548.80] P:1661.00 E:0.092917 |  he wasn't going to get to the ball either, Venetius Jr so ran into Fabinho, won the free kick but I
[548.80 - 551.84] P:1737.33 E:0.093584 |  don't think it's going to be any more than that. We've only been playing eight minutes John and
[551.84 - 556.96] P:1717.03 E:0.088319 |  already two or three times down that Liverpool right hand side, the goal came from there then
[556.96 - 561.36] P:1648.70 E:0.096758 |  that pass from Henderson in behind for Salah again, they're looking comfortable down that side.
[561.92 - 569.12] P:1567.06 E:0.090116 |  Liverpool one, Real Madrid nail, still nail nail in the other match tonight, I track Frankfurt
[569.12 - 576.24] P:1596.24 E:0.087004 |  against Napoli who won Liverpool's group and Real Madrid with the ball in front of their
[576.24 - 583.36] P:1724.13 E:0.095779 |  own penalty area. Tomorrow night, RB Leipzig against Manchester City so you'll hear that this time
[583.36 - 589.28] P:1709.09 E:0.090069 |  tomorrow live from inside the stadium in Germany with Ian Dennis and Matt Upson and I think they're
[589.28 - 593.52] P:1658.21 E:0.090634 |  here from no matter the half time actually in this match and the England Belgium game
[593.52 - 597.60] P:1485.39 E:0.089034 |  will be on Sport Expert tomorrow night in the Arnold Clark Cup and we will hear from Serena
[597.60 - 603.68] P:1535.01 E:0.097601 |  Wiegman at half time as well but nine minutes played, one nail to Liverpool and quite a goal
[603.68 - 610.48] P:1454.08 E:0.089092 |  from Darwin Nunes, he scored a better one that so far for Liverpool, I'm not sure if I've seen it,
[611.04 - 616.16] P:1741.53 E:0.087870 |  he has Bayer Cetiz inside his own half, what a night for him Bayer Cetiz? He's made a really good
[616.24 - 620.80] P:1710.14 E:0.094013 |  start, he played a part in the goal as did Gackport, they both had early touches and they were really
[620.80 - 625.20] P:1579.18 E:0.090631 |  good touches which didn't have to give you confidence in the early part of the game. Yes and remember
[625.20 - 631.44] P:1538.06 E:0.095033 |  he is a Spaniard born in northern Spain in Viggo, his dad played for South of Viggo, so well aware
[631.44 - 637.68] P:1398.88 E:0.092441 |  of what Real Madrid are all about and this is his seventh consecutive start, so regular start I'm
[637.68 - 641.76] P:1499.78 E:0.097873 |  out for the number 43, Liverpool with the ball on the right hand side, Salah and Alexander-Arnold
[641.76 - 645.68] P:1730.21 E:0.094957 |  together, Salah gets it down, he's got space on the right hand side, right foot across towards the
[645.68 - 650.72] P:1572.17 E:0.086261 |  edge of the area, it's over everyone, Robertson was arriving but he had to check back and then it's
[650.72 - 656.24] P:1623.33 E:0.088936 |  given away by Cetiz, that's how it works of course, talking up and he gives the ball away,
[656.24 - 661.68] P:1730.76 E:0.094626 |  Real Madrid now coming forward with Venetius Jr, it bounces out to the left hand side, Benzema,
[661.68 - 665.28] P:1771.02 E:0.094387 |  first time we've seen him involved really, Benzema out of the edge, the middle of the
[665.28 - 671.92] P:1821.77 E:0.098342 |  half to Valverde, he's playing in the central role tonight, the Uruguayan, now Benzema again,
[671.92 - 676.48] P:1863.79 E:0.095142 |  Benzema cutting in from the left hand side but Modric just as he receives the pass, doesn't even
[676.48 - 683.12] P:1802.14 E:0.093386 |  attempt to give it back to Benzema, just goes back out to the far side, look at Modric at the age of 37,
[683.76 - 689.60] P:1573.75 E:0.110329 |  saw so much of him at the World Cup, now here he is again, what a career still going, but he'll
[689.60 - 694.40] P:1554.49 E:0.101168 |  ever finish, now the ball to the right hand side, the Carvajal, Carvajal low into the edge of the
[694.40 - 698.96] P:1720.57 E:0.101117 |  penalty area, Rodrigo is there but Robertson comes across with with a challenge just to take it away
[699.52 - 704.40] P:1689.89 E:0.095655 |  Real Madrid having their best spell so far, crossing from the left hand side though, that's an easy
[704.40 - 710.08] P:1699.95 E:0.083718 |  catch for Alisson, 1-0 Liverpool, yeah again though when Liverpool were attacking just 30 seconds ago,
[710.08 - 716.00] P:1572.49 E:0.084050 |  it was down that right hand side again and they're having to work really hard down there, particularly
[716.00 - 721.44] P:1637.95 E:0.084779 |  defensively, Venetius and Alaba at left back, second leg in the Spanish capital in three weeks time,
[721.44 - 726.96] P:1629.38 E:0.081834 |  we'll be there for that and at the moment with this score line, long long way to go but it's set up
[727.92 - 732.96] P:1476.12 E:0.092515 |  very interestingly with that goal, as I say in the fourth minute, oh heavy touch from Gomez on the
[732.96 - 737.36] P:1594.95 E:0.097111 |  edge of his own penalty area, Benzema was onto him, Liverpool haven't got it away, it's back to Benzema,
[737.36 - 742.40] P:1795.54 E:0.099807 |  squares it, Rodrigo with a chance but Van Dijk is able to come across and just steps into the way of
[742.40 - 748.88] P:1617.81 E:0.076829 |  the shot and blocks it away with his left foot, sloppy from Gomez, his team here, he's sent a
[748.88 - 754.96] P:1771.60 E:0.113745 |  half-partner, helped him out a lot there, what a block that was, Liverpool breaking away and Gatko
[754.96 - 760.24] P:1685.62 E:0.110177 |  has been clearly pulled back by Camavenga but the referee's playing advantage and Gatko's found
[760.24 - 765.76] P:1679.26 E:0.110957 |  Salah and Salah approaching the penalty area, Benzema and shooting wide at the Neapolst,
[768.56 - 773.76] P:1776.20 E:0.103316 |  God they look so good going forward, don't they Gatko, fantastic getting that ball again at his feet,
[773.76 - 778.88] P:1721.59 E:0.103971 |  getting it and turning, having the strength to push the defender off, then roll the ball out to Salah
[778.88 - 783.28] P:1810.05 E:0.094363 |  again on that right hand side and he cuts in on that left foot and he's just waiting for him
[783.36 - 787.04] P:1881.00 E:0.095435 |  to hit it on you and he does hit it but he just doesn't get the connection that he wanted.
[787.60 - 794.24] P:1711.68 E:0.089620 |  Yeah just seen to miss hit it really but I mean he burst between the two Real Madrid players
[794.80 - 799.04] P:1602.00 E:0.095109 |  and he was cute, he was going for the near bottom corner wasn't he?
[799.04 - 802.64] P:1839.04 E:0.099901 |  Tried to see it and I don't watch the eyes didn't he where he was looking at the far side,
[802.64 - 806.64] P:1697.27 E:0.081130 |  his right hand side and he tried to just pull it back towards the near post.
[806.64 - 812.48] P:1617.13 E:0.093707 |  Liverpool coming forward with Bayekic but runs into a nest of white there near the edge of the
[812.48 - 817.84] P:1612.74 E:0.103121 |  Real Madrid penalty area and Milly Tau plays it back to Kua Tua who clears from the ground but
[817.84 - 823.12] P:1763.49 E:0.106162 |  that will bounce out of play, actually it's bounced right into the hands of the former Everton manager
[823.12 - 830.24] P:1660.80 E:0.081532 |  Carlo Ancelotti down there, four times winner now of the Champions League as a coach, no one's done
[830.24 - 835.68] P:1655.05 E:0.085276 |  that, been involved in five Champions League finals as a coach, that's a record as well
[836.48 - 841.92] P:1695.42 E:0.094260 |  and Gomez playing a long pass over the top but Kua Tua will come and take that.
[841.92 - 847.92] P:1748.51 E:0.091438 |  Apparently the goal that Nunez scored was the quickest goal that Liverpool have scored at Anfield
[847.92 - 855.20] P:1800.56 E:0.089370 |  in the Champions League which mildly surprised them fourth minute. Norwich have taken the lead
[855.20 - 862.88] P:1609.81 E:0.084119 |  against Birmingham City so Norwich won Birmingham Nell, another Nunez, Marcelino Nunez with the
[862.88 - 870.48] P:1652.14 E:0.086488 |  goal for Norwich. Five live final score in operation tonight with all of the matches,
[870.56 - 875.20] P:1688.00 E:0.100038 |  Valverde hooking the ball in field but Van Dijk is able to come across and clear it to the halfway
[875.20 - 879.92] P:1543.98 E:0.106669 |  line, there's a slip by Henderson in there then a slip by Camervenga, we've seen quite a lot of that
[879.92 - 884.24] P:1626.05 E:0.091835 |  actually from the players who both changed, Henderson now to gap over advances away from him
[884.80 - 894.64] P:1815.89 E:0.116081 |  and Kua Tua has lost it and Salah scores, oh what a slip, what a slip from the great Kua Tua,
[894.64 - 900.64] P:1721.11 E:0.117277 |  the man who almost single-handedly stopped Liverpool in the Champions League final last season,
[901.20 - 908.56] P:1810.51 E:0.109858 |  awful touch, gave it straight to Salah and Salah said yep that'll do for me and it was in the back
[908.56 - 915.44] P:1827.25 E:0.108154 |  of the net in a flash and it's Liverpool 2, Real Madrid Nell, less than 15 minutes on the clock.
[915.44 - 921.76] P:1806.62 E:0.098233 |  What a huge error, that is from Kua Tua, he wasn't really under any pressure, he decides to take
[921.76 - 926.08] P:1801.86 E:0.107811 |  another touch foolishly because he can see Salah coming down at him
[927.84 - 933.76] P:1813.83 E:0.107045 |  and he just gets it all wrong and it falls so kindly for more Salah, he says thank you very
[933.76 - 942.32] P:1604.28 E:0.097093 |  much, open goal 2-0. Well of all the things that we might have seen tonight, I wasn't expecting that,
[942.88 - 948.16] P:1656.58 E:0.104531 |  he chested it down and it bounced off his knee, he chested it down, was going to take a touch,
[948.24 - 952.64] P:1672.37 E:0.101469 |  bounced up and when he went to play it, it bounced off his knee on his standing foot
[953.20 - 958.56] P:1676.04 E:0.108954 |  straight into the path of Salah on the corner of the six yard box, one touch left foot bang 2-0.
[958.56 - 962.64] P:1723.33 E:0.107934 |  Salah's not even putting them under pressure, Salah's actually stood off him there until he
[962.64 - 967.12] P:1789.11 E:0.100500 |  actually decides to take that other touch and gets it horribly wrong where it hits his knee
[967.12 - 975.60] P:1556.94 E:0.094707 |  and bounces perfectly for Salah. Nuno's in the fourth minute, Salah in the 14th, Salah who now
[975.60 - 980.08] P:1789.51 E:0.101558 |  becomes the top scorer this season in the Champions League incidentally, that's his eighth
[980.08 - 986.16] P:1879.55 E:0.093485 |  goal in the Champions League and that means he's scored in six consecutive Champions League matches
[986.16 - 995.76] P:1710.84 E:0.097885 |  now, Blackburn are winning 1-0 over Ewood Park against Blackpool, so Blackburn 1, Blackpool 0,
[996.48 - 1004.00] P:1827.21 E:0.094517 |  Tyrese Dolan with the goal there and the crowd inevitably getting straight onto Courtois
[1004.00 - 1007.92] P:1593.41 E:0.085837 |  when it was played back to him and this time his sure foot had clearance.
[1008.80 - 1011.68] P:1676.95 E:0.108172 |  Just what he should have done the first time instead of trying to take that extra touch,
[1011.68 - 1017.52] P:1641.54 E:0.104930 |  it wasn't a great ball into him but it wasn't that difficult to see what he actually did,
[1017.52 - 1020.24] P:1592.70 E:0.101260 |  he took win and taken that extra touch, terrible error.
[1021.84 - 1032.24] P:1590.66 E:0.084808 |  Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 0, still 0-0, Eintracht Frankfurt and Napoli and Real Madrid now,
[1032.24 - 1038.80] P:1820.71 E:0.099311 |  both swept in from the left hand side but it's hooked away by Van Dijk in the penalty area,
[1038.80 - 1042.88] P:1671.05 E:0.084891 |  just in front of the penalty spot, right foot, volleys it out to the far side.
[1043.76 - 1050.08] P:1616.90 E:0.089682 |  I did wonder whether Matip might have played tonight but the Joe Gomez continues in the team,
[1050.88 - 1057.44] P:1596.53 E:0.106086 |  seven starts in a roll for him now, Matip on the bench tonight, back alongside Van Dijk who returned
[1057.52 - 1063.84] P:1577.30 E:0.104650 |  to the team against Newcastle, now Real Madrid on the right, attacking towards the court,
[1063.84 - 1067.68] P:1578.22 E:0.105959 |  down to where we're right but the ball in from Carvajal is deflected out of play by Núñez,
[1067.68 - 1073.36] P:1578.19 E:0.098062 |  comes back to the Real Madrid number two after the throw and now to Mili Tau, the Brazilian World Cup
[1073.36 - 1079.92] P:1642.44 E:0.088647 |  defender, just carries the ball, just drags it to his left and gives it to Ruediga, Champions League
[1080.00 - 1087.92] P:1760.74 E:0.089169 |  winner with Chelsea in Porto against Manchester City remember, Ruediga forward towards Modric
[1088.72 - 1094.88] P:1835.84 E:0.095010 |  who flicks it nonchalantly, roundabout waist height, just got his foot up and
[1094.88 - 1099.36] P:1779.04 E:0.093019 |  with the outside of his boot gave it to the left hand side to Venetius but now on the right,
[1099.36 - 1103.60] P:1751.09 E:0.098202 |  Carvajal heads it into the box, Rodrigo pulls it back but pulls it back behind Benzemaque
[1103.60 - 1107.92] P:1649.23 E:0.099247 |  and Liverpool are able to take possession and Fabinho plays it downfield, Salah on the stretch,
[1107.92 - 1113.20] P:1714.63 E:0.111858 |  can't get to it and Ruediga is able to see it back to Cuatroar, Tivo Cuatroar
[1114.24 - 1119.12] P:1627.60 E:0.084907 |  on his left foot passes it out into the right back position and Real Madrid clear.
[1119.12 - 1121.76] P:1862.72 E:0.099122 |  I shouldn't laugh, John, but the reaction to the crowd makes me.
[1124.72 - 1130.88] P:1673.17 E:0.099736 |  I don't care who you are, you know, Tivo Cuatroar, one of the best goalkeepers in the world,
[1131.44 - 1136.48] P:1560.62 E:0.099101 |  so if you've got 50 or 1000 people inside Anfield putting pressure on you like that when you've
[1136.48 - 1140.56] P:1541.63 E:0.095770 |  made a mistake, a bad mistake just a few minutes earlier, that's going to get to anyone, I don't
[1140.56 - 1146.56] P:1689.98 E:0.085564 |  care. Here's Robertson, Robertson right footed forward comes off Valverde, bounces into the
[1146.56 - 1153.12] P:1714.44 E:0.103518 |  Real Madrid half and Militão should deal with that. That's a poor ball away from Militão,
[1153.12 - 1157.68] P:1721.58 E:0.101502 |  he's giving it to Bytetnic, Núñez available on the left, that was the pass actually, we can see
[1157.68 - 1163.04] P:1693.52 E:0.092404 |  from up here he went infield and that gave it back to Real Madrid, however Fabinho has got it
[1163.12 - 1167.52] P:1641.39 E:0.092265 |  forward at the centre circle, angle ball from him, Robertson, Salah with a flake and then headed
[1167.52 - 1173.52] P:1800.61 E:0.097110 |  back by Carvajal to Cuatroar. Panic stations every time it goes into that back four of Real Madrid,
[1174.16 - 1177.76] P:1786.44 E:0.096450 |  the Liverpool players have put that much pressure on them, they seem as if every time
[1177.76 - 1182.96] P:1841.80 E:0.092714 |  they get in the ball they're under pressure and they're making mistakes, Liverpool are forcing
[1182.96 - 1190.32] P:1691.10 E:0.077182 |  them into them. That's a series of errors at the back from Real Madrid, giving the ball away,
[1190.40 - 1197.60] P:1691.35 E:0.094575 |  obviously the Cuatroar slip that led to the second goal, so Núñez and Salah with the goals,
[1197.60 - 1205.76] P:1657.22 E:0.081632 |  19 for the season now for Salah, Real Madrid playing the ball out from the back and Camavinha now
[1205.76 - 1212.40] P:1716.38 E:0.087598 |  to the left hand side, Norte Uemene who stayed at home, he's been ill as well but Tony Carose
[1212.40 - 1218.08] P:1735.42 E:0.084974 |  on the bench tonight for Real Madrid having been flown in this afternoon, recovered from the illness
[1218.08 - 1222.88] P:1713.01 E:0.082167 |  that he had, didn't travel with the squad last night, he has Modric on the left hand side,
[1222.88 - 1229.84] P:1788.55 E:0.091540 |  Modric to Venicius Jr and then back to the centre circle, Real Madrid have actually won
[1229.84 - 1235.44] P:1844.77 E:0.093606 |  their last four matches but two of them were at the Club World Cup, ended up playing Al
[1235.44 - 1240.64] P:1723.87 E:0.095993 |  Hilal in the final but have won their two league matches since they returned, eight points behind
[1240.64 - 1244.88] P:1605.59 E:0.097012 |  Barcelona who will be here in the north west of England, well they'll be arriving tomorrow won't
[1244.88 - 1250.08] P:1751.97 E:0.095141 |  they to play Manchester United on Thursday, it's quite a week that isn't it, these four clubs all
[1250.08 - 1257.28] P:1730.90 E:0.083072 |  playing in the north west of England in the same week, Real Madrid with Camavinha out to the left
[1257.28 - 1262.72] P:1630.55 E:0.090498 |  hand side taken down by Venicius, Venicius Jr now near the left corner of the penalty area,
[1262.72 - 1267.36] P:1661.27 E:0.094820 |  cutting in field then turning back to Benzmont close quarters, Venicius Jr again great footwork,
[1267.44 - 1275.04] P:1612.17 E:0.106829 |  oh what a goal, that's incredible, what a finish from Venicius Jr, how he saw that,
[1275.04 - 1279.76] P:1539.36 E:0.111564 |  there were defenders, three of them in front of him, he had to beat Alisson as well and he whipped
[1279.76 - 1286.08] P:1531.17 E:0.109808 |  it, bent it low into the far bottom corner and Real Madrid have a goal back, a brilliant goal
[1286.08 - 1292.96] P:1705.43 E:0.094952 |  back to one Liverpool. World class defenders all over him, no space whatsoever, he just picks his
[1293.04 - 1298.88] P:1728.06 E:0.106371 |  spot, he has one little look up and curls that in with his right foot, he looks at that far corner,
[1298.88 - 1304.40] P:1773.90 E:0.100089 |  there's hardly any space, Gomez is trying to close him down, Alisson's got no chance,
[1304.40 - 1306.40] P:1728.43 E:0.112003 |  what a response from Real Madrid that is.
[1308.96 - 1315.28] P:1564.22 E:0.103755 |  Well that's changed the mood which was celebratory when Liverpool were two-nil up,
[1316.00 - 1320.80] P:1614.60 E:0.100753 |  but that goal in the 21st minute so three goals in the first quarter of the match,
[1320.88 - 1325.52] P:1627.90 E:0.098738 |  first quarter of the first leg, and now it's the Real Madrid fans down there all in white
[1325.52 - 1330.96] P:1630.79 E:0.103982 |  who have been very very quiet for the first 20 minutes of the match but suddenly it's all Real
[1330.96 - 1337.20] P:1614.60 E:0.092696 |  Madrid songs in that corner and flags waving, Spanish national flags, as Henderson wins the
[1337.20 - 1341.84] P:1722.87 E:0.097750 |  ball back from Venicius in the edge of the area, Salah into the box but that will just roll through
[1341.84 - 1349.20] P:1695.06 E:0.088032 |  to Couottoir. Norwich now two-nil up on Birmingham, Marcellino with his second goal of the match
[1349.20 - 1358.32] P:1533.55 E:0.079406 |  for Norwich, Norwich two Birmingham nil, so there we are then, well when you have quality like that
[1358.32 - 1364.08] P:1582.63 E:0.090557 |  on the field, Alon, you can't do anything about that. It's just a little message, well not a little,
[1364.08 - 1369.12] P:1542.25 E:0.100130 |  it's a big message to Liverpool to see, we've got world-class players particularly in forward
[1369.12 - 1375.12] P:1507.74 E:0.097022 |  positions and that's exactly what they can do, they can punish you. And there he is again, Venicius
[1375.12 - 1383.92] P:1643.33 E:0.099572 |  Jr scored the only goal in the final against Liverpool last season, scored two goals against
[1383.92 - 1391.20] P:1678.99 E:0.092914 |  Liverpool in the quarter-final the season before when Real Madrid won 3-1 in Madrid and that did it,
[1391.20 - 1398.48] P:1597.41 E:0.085702 |  that was enough to see them through and now here he is again, a real thorn in Liverpool's side.
[1399.44 - 1402.96] P:1629.13 E:0.106547 |  He actually wanted a little one too I think you know with Benzemaal because I think Benzemaal
[1402.96 - 1406.96] P:1600.92 E:0.092012 |  the ones that actually cleared it into him, he ran off and thinking he was going to get it back,
[1406.96 - 1411.92] P:1625.24 E:0.096901 |  no chance, he just moved inside, moved the ball one yard and whipped it into that far post.
[1412.56 - 1417.68] P:1489.16 E:0.094247 |  From probably, over on the left-hand side of the penalty area, certainly 20 yards I would have said,
[1418.24 - 1423.68] P:1524.58 E:0.091012 |  approaching 20 yards but it was pinpoint and Alisson, his view might have been blocked actually
[1423.68 - 1429.12] P:1459.20 E:0.082693 |  Alisson from with all of the defenders who were in there but anyway it was hit with such pace,
[1429.20 - 1433.12] P:1636.44 E:0.098009 |  Liverpool coming forward though, ball from the right-hand side, Robertson plays it across the box
[1433.12 - 1438.32] P:1550.15 E:0.097609 |  in Rudiger, he was able to clear it away only to Alexander-Arnold though but the bouncing ball,
[1438.32 - 1443.12] P:1715.12 E:0.101156 |  he's lost the bouncing ball and Camervinga plays it forward for Venicius Jr and Real Madrid,
[1443.12 - 1448.56] P:1785.98 E:0.103531 |  it's 4 against 3 and it's played across into the path of Gomez who was able to readjust and clear
[1448.56 - 1454.16] P:1681.03 E:0.095720 |  it away and he got that wrong Venicius Jr. And it was good defending John from Virgil van Dijkers,
[1454.16 - 1458.72] P:1844.03 E:0.094044 |  he was actually left within 1v1 and instead of diving and he just stood up there and didn't
[1458.72 - 1466.40] P:1551.90 E:0.081775 |  panic and forced them into the pass which is a poor one. Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1, special occasion,
[1467.04 - 1470.64] P:1631.05 E:0.097352 |  it's already been a special match hasn't it? We said there was going to be goals John didn't we?
[1471.36 - 1480.32] P:1370.93 E:0.090478 |  We were right, that's not often, first time for everything, by Cetic, so this is quite a start to
[1481.36 - 1488.00] P:1496.27 E:0.095506 |  what is a really big few days of commentary matches on 5 live, that's what they're all like this,
[1488.00 - 1492.40] P:1494.53 E:0.093251 |  van Dijk, swinging the ball forward towards the far side, Henderson's out there, comes back in
[1492.40 - 1498.80] P:1418.98 E:0.086501 |  field towards Fabinho, Fabinho back onto his right foot, Alexander-Arnold, Alexander-Arnold,
[1498.80 - 1503.52] P:1779.65 E:0.108010 |  oh that's a lovely ball through to Henderson who cuts it back, Salah, Salah still going,
[1503.52 - 1508.16] P:1768.30 E:0.109598 |  bounces down, Munoz still in the 6 yard box and Real Madrid have cleared it,
[1508.16 - 1513.44] P:1680.88 E:0.099997 |  Kavahal just hacked it away in the end and I'm not sure quite how that didn't end up in the back of
[1513.44 - 1521.12] P:1700.86 E:0.096575 |  the Real Madrid net. Well Trent, Salah, Henderson causing chaos again down there right hand side
[1521.12 - 1525.60] P:1728.23 E:0.094886 |  and they get the ball and how on earth that doesn't end up in the back of the net with Salah having to
[1525.60 - 1531.12] P:1826.25 E:0.100017 |  go, Nunez having to go and Real Madrid players throwing themselves at the ball, a yard or two off
[1531.12 - 1537.68] P:1589.83 E:0.088535 |  their goal line, he managed just to clear it. The balance of Salah there is incredible when the
[1537.68 - 1542.32] P:1594.92 E:0.105283 |  ball is cut back to him, there are three defenders there and he's twisting and turning, keeps the
[1542.32 - 1548.16] P:1678.16 E:0.098737 |  ball at his feet, I think he back healed it goalwards in the end, that was blocked, Feltonuñez,
[1548.16 - 1552.48] P:1778.64 E:0.081970 |  Real Madrid player down so we've got a stoppage, it feels like the first stoppage of the match
[1552.48 - 1558.16] P:1647.39 E:0.081322 |  and we're in the first, we've played 25 minutes now and it's going to be a throwing deliverable
[1558.16 - 1566.80] P:1630.21 E:0.082707 |  for the Real Madrid man down, surrounded by his teammates so it's not absolutely clear who it is
[1566.80 - 1577.04] P:1592.51 E:0.077642 |  down there, is it Alaba, could be, but Chance van Field actually just have to take a breath here
[1577.04 - 1582.64] P:1530.49 E:0.092016 |  after an incredible first 25 minutes in the Champions League, we say it time and again Alan, don't we?
[1583.28 - 1589.36] P:1508.64 E:0.093620 |  And why do they want to change it, why do they want to tamper with it? No, you honestly, it baffles me
[1589.36 - 1595.12] P:1644.06 E:0.090046 |  is because it works, it works perfectly and when you see performances and matches like this
[1595.28 - 1601.84] P:1419.92 E:0.093096 |  evening, absolutely why? I'm not sure he's going to be able to continue, that's quite a loss,
[1601.84 - 1607.36] P:1467.29 E:0.098282 |  I think it is Alaba and I think I've seen the indication there from the medical people that
[1607.36 - 1614.48] P:1558.00 E:0.102323 |  it's a problem and yeah Real Madrid are going to make a change, so it's Nacho, I think they
[1614.48 - 1621.76] P:1595.42 E:0.099618 |  experience Nacho Fernandez who is being called forward by Carlo Ancelotti who's leaning over him,
[1622.08 - 1633.28] P:1431.73 E:0.088016 |  hands in his pocket, just muttering a couple of pearls of wisdom to him and Alaba, the
[1634.08 - 1640.16] P:1494.60 E:0.087675 |  long-clowned Bayern Munich man, Champions League winner now with Real Madrid as well, playing in
[1640.16 - 1646.64] P:1544.24 E:0.087601 |  the final last year, actually playing central defensive if you remember last year with Mendi
[1646.80 - 1652.16] P:1575.65 E:0.083831 |  Fullback who's out injured at the moment and yep he's being led off the field over on the
[1652.16 - 1665.52] P:1473.14 E:0.092179 |  far side so this is the first change and that is it for Alaba, just giving a little hook there by
[1665.52 - 1673.60] P:1542.19 E:0.087068 |  Edan Militao, consolation and Nacho is coming on and he is going to take over there on the far
[1673.60 - 1679.60] P:1619.14 E:0.098153 |  side on the left, Nacho. Alaba had a really tough time in those 27 minutes he's actually been on
[1679.60 - 1683.92] P:1588.52 E:0.097401 |  the pitch because I said it maybe five or ten minutes ago the number of times that Liverpool
[1683.92 - 1688.48] P:1618.82 E:0.089639 |  attacked down that side. Yeah Liverpool back underway by Chetituk, the ball across the penalty
[1688.48 - 1696.40] P:1723.51 E:0.093917 |  area in the back is out and behind, yes is our friend Mark Lawlinson would say occasionally in
[1696.40 - 1702.00] P:1677.53 E:0.084485 |  circumstances such as this, maybe it's a problem with twisted blood after being sent this way and
[1702.00 - 1711.04] P:1522.93 E:0.085887 |  to the by Liverpool but Salas had a, oh there's another slip in the area by Militao and he was able
[1711.04 - 1718.40] P:1700.01 E:0.093916 |  to recover and get up and clear it away downfield, it has been an issue whether it's been over watered
[1718.40 - 1723.44] P:1682.50 E:0.078429 |  I don't know but the players have slipped on a regular basis. Yeah there have been three or four of
[1723.44 - 1728.00] P:1499.05 E:0.089870 |  them and Militao's actually still limping there because of that slip. Gomez clears the ball
[1728.00 - 1734.64] P:1513.23 E:0.090972 |  away downfield that's Alan Shearer with us here for this dramatic Champions League match here on
[1734.64 - 1740.72] P:1595.09 E:0.081850 |  five live, ball still in play on the far side Fabinho stretching forward that's off his shin,
[1740.72 - 1745.44] P:1496.21 E:0.098683 |  Valverde that is head to it, Camervenga then plays it back into centre of the fence and it's played
[1745.44 - 1752.96] P:1527.29 E:0.090367 |  back with Pace by Rudiger to Courtois but he was able to deal with that, control it and Real Madrid
[1752.96 - 1758.80] P:1536.55 E:0.087276 |  pass it out from the back, Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1 is the score, long ball downfield that's
[1759.52 - 1765.92] P:1586.70 E:0.093922 |  chested down to a teammate by Alexander-Arnold to Van Dijk, Salah now turning on the halfway line
[1766.48 - 1773.76] P:1555.83 E:0.097166 |  but Rudiger passes it back to Courtois, this not as Pace so he was able to watch that under
[1773.76 - 1782.08] P:1438.77 E:0.087122 |  his left foot and clear it to the halfway line, Modric now back to Camervenga again who with
[1782.08 - 1788.00] P:1504.59 E:0.096360 |  his head bobbing gives it by a Militao now to Carvajal on the right hand side and then Rodrigo
[1788.00 - 1792.88] P:1651.97 E:0.095526 |  back and field to Carvajal, angles it back to Valverde 30 yards out square from him to Modric,
[1792.88 - 1797.36] P:1680.79 E:0.091290 |  left foot then to the edge of the box to Benzema, Modric again to the left hand side,
[1797.36 - 1803.84] P:1823.23 E:0.102202 |  Venetius clips it into the back post, Carvajal couldn't quite get to it because Núñez came across
[1803.84 - 1808.40] P:1690.44 E:0.096968 |  and was able to head it behind for a corner. It's really good work from Núñez, we saw what he can do
[1808.40 - 1811.36] P:1829.69 E:0.102440 |  at the other end but that's what you've got to do as well, you've got to do a little bit
[1811.36 - 1816.16] P:1733.14 E:0.086199 |  defensive when you certainly did there otherwise Carvajal was in at that far post.
[1816.16 - 1821.44] P:1587.93 E:0.082899 |  Corner event for Real Madrid, first corner of the match actually, half an hour played,
[1822.96 - 1829.36] P:1654.45 E:0.095579 |  Modric just runs his fingers through his fair hair, headband on and the referee's blowing his
[1829.36 - 1839.92] P:1575.91 E:0.079401 |  whistle so Modric's delivery is academic, you'll have to do it again and it's Fabinho and Benzema
[1840.56 - 1846.96] P:1519.08 E:0.103672 |  who are being spoken to, Benzema continues to talk to the referee, Benzema coming back for this
[1846.96 - 1851.76] P:1642.21 E:0.098584 |  match, he's had a bruising on his leg, that was the issue that kept him out of the weekend,
[1851.76 - 1856.56] P:1693.14 E:0.099369 |  Modric then with the corner, comes off a Real Madrid head right to Venetius at the back, Venetius
[1856.56 - 1862.48] P:1839.20 E:0.098815 |  shoots across, that's an excellent save by Alisson, cross shot from the far side of the box, bang on
[1862.48 - 1867.52] P:1769.64 E:0.099634 |  target would have gone in the same corner that he scored his first goal but Alisson was up to it
[1867.52 - 1873.20] P:1834.78 E:0.094950 |  this time, he's almost identical from exactly the same position, he moves it again onto his right
[1873.20 - 1879.12] P:1627.05 E:0.090758 |  foot, this time Alisson just managed to get to his left hand side and down low, it's a fantastic
[1879.12 - 1886.48] P:1487.86 E:0.082886 |  effort again and a good save by Alisson, yeah he was at full extension there, got his left glove
[1886.48 - 1894.56] P:1608.04 E:0.083766 |  to it, Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1, the half time coming up in the 745 kickoffs tonight so I'll
[1894.56 - 1899.28] P:1636.45 E:0.095954 |  run you through those when we get them all in, we're going to go to Millwall in a moment but
[1899.28 - 1903.92] P:1671.52 E:0.099251 |  Henderson gives it to Bychetta, she was shrugged off the ball, Real Madrid have got it back,
[1903.92 - 1908.40] P:1678.19 E:0.090238 |  Camervinga might have been fouled by Fabinho, referee plays the advantage, Benzema back to
[1908.40 - 1916.08] P:1768.81 E:0.096935 |  Modric, 25 yards out into the edge of the area, Rodrigo and then Valverde slashes his shot and
[1916.08 - 1921.20] P:1644.77 E:0.097374 |  it lands halfway up the cup. Well first of all Camervinga did well to win the ball and then
[1921.20 - 1926.48] P:1660.99 E:0.097144 |  release it into the little magician of Modric into that, into the midfield and the balance and
[1926.48 - 1932.32] P:1632.08 E:0.093791 |  the technique that he's showing out there is just incredible considering his age and they move the
[1932.32 - 1938.40] P:1657.76 E:0.087404 |  ball to that right hand side, I think it's Valverde that actually takes the shot on when he had
[1938.40 - 1943.20] P:1615.31 E:0.090357 |  other options in the middle you know, luckily for Liverpool he put it high into the cup.
[1944.00 - 1949.28] P:1668.66 E:0.095726 |  Liverpool 2, Real Madrid 1, five live, BBC sounds if you're on the move of course, you can listen
[1949.36 - 1953.52] P:1445.87 E:0.082694 |  to the live radio wherever you are, Liverpool playing the ball out from the back, we're going
[1953.52 - 1957.44] P:1616.36 E:0.094060 |  to go to the den when we get a chance because it is half time there, the lead has Burnley,
[1958.24 - 1963.28] P:1570.66 E:0.098111 |  here's Fabinho playing it up towards Henderson who chests it off and then Alexander-Arnold
[1963.28 - 1968.32] P:1653.92 E:0.092528 |  it might have bounced up into the arm of Venetius, it is, it's a free kick to Liverpool on the
[1968.32 - 1974.16] P:1563.52 E:0.096584 |  halfway line, so come in from East London, Aaron Paul. We're in deep south, Millwell-Nill, Burnley-Nill,
[1974.16 - 1978.08] P:1597.57 E:0.099830 |  the league leaders have dominated large parts of this half but have been frustrated by Millwall
[1978.08 - 1982.48] P:1518.33 E:0.110714 |  who have boxed clever George Longus, save one from Ana Zorri, Zian Fleming has come closest for
[1982.48 - 1988.88] P:1527.31 E:0.095610 |  the home side, Millwell. Half time, Blackburn 1, Blackpool 0, Norwich 2, Birmingham 0,
[1989.60 - 1993.12] P:1720.20 E:0.093890 |  Swansea 1, Stoke City 2 and they're still playing,
[1994.48 - 2001.68] P:1623.93 E:0.087937 |  Rotherham and Sunderland in the first half and it is 1-0 to Rotherham as Carbohal heads the ball
[2001.68 - 2007.76] P:1679.39 E:0.086072 |  out of play. League 1 half times coming up but Liverpool in possession on the halfway line with
[2007.76 - 2013.60] P:1728.45 E:0.093499 |  Bytcetic, square to Gomez and then Gomez, load at the right hand side, Salah with the first time
[2013.60 - 2017.92] P:1619.20 E:0.094999 |  touching to the path of Henderson on the right, Henderson back to Salah, bounces off Valverde
[2018.48 - 2023.20] P:1682.55 E:0.089827 |  into the path of Salah, almost, Salah then is able to get there first, played to the left hand
[2023.20 - 2027.52] P:1625.06 E:0.092020 |  side to Robertson, comes back to the edge of the penalty area, Gakpo is after that but he slipped
[2027.52 - 2033.76] P:1667.83 E:0.097734 |  again, Gakpo then wins it back from Nacho and Gakpo's cross is over everyone in red and is hooked
[2033.76 - 2039.04] P:1662.68 E:0.107356 |  away by Valverde on the edge of the box. The mistakes at the back of Real Madrid are just
[2039.04 - 2043.76] P:1648.75 E:0.100493 |  incredible, they're inviting Liverpool onto them and Salah and Nunez, look as they've
[2043.76 - 2048.08] P:1721.06 E:0.104788 |  happened the field day there, every time they get the ball they're looking dangerous and under pressure.
[2048.08 - 2053.44] P:1612.73 E:0.095381 |  So jittery don't they Real Madrid, Salah carrying the ball between two defenders blocked by the
[2053.44 - 2059.60] P:1773.79 E:0.108255 |  third on the edge of the area but Real Madrid so dangerous on the break although Jordan Henderson
[2060.16 - 2065.44] P:1729.53 E:0.099706 |  extremely well to come back and take the ball away from Venetius, half time in league one,
[2065.44 - 2072.56] P:1551.57 E:0.092317 |  Fleetwood Nail, Cambridge United Nail and Morkham Nail, Port Vale Nail and in league two this is easy
[2073.60 - 2081.36] P:1589.01 E:0.093547 |  all four matches in league two at halftime are Nail Nail, one-one between Hamilton and Inverdes
[2081.36 - 2086.72] P:1435.13 E:0.088893 |  in the championship in Scotland at halftime and Albion Rovers Nail, Elgin City Nail at halftime
[2086.72 - 2092.00] P:1736.43 E:0.101841 |  also, a ball with Liverpool on the right hand side Alexander-Arnold comes across and the ball's
[2092.00 - 2100.32] P:1629.00 E:0.082686 |  chipped out of play and it's a throwing to Liverpool down the right hand side that is taken by the
[2100.32 - 2104.72] P:1539.41 E:0.089365 |  Liverpool right back who incidentally is a yellow card away from suspension in the Champions League
[2104.72 - 2112.00] P:1771.85 E:0.103084 |  ball in from him to the back post with Robertson arriving but it was just a little too high
[2112.00 - 2117.04] P:1590.32 E:0.079885 |  defender might have got a touch must have done it's out of play it's a throwing to Liverpool
[2118.00 - 2124.56] P:1700.80 E:0.086867 |  down the left which is taken by Nunez back to nearer the halfway line by Chetnick and then Fabinho
[2124.56 - 2133.60] P:1696.24 E:0.087052 |  goes back into his own half and Liverpool with Fabinho right footed ball cross field taken down
[2133.60 - 2139.60] P:1685.83 E:0.095326 |  by Salah, Salah running at Nacho the 33 year old the substitute and then Salah with a touch on the
[2139.60 - 2145.12] P:1715.62 E:0.091214 |  Nacho who kept it in did well actually, Modric inside his own half he gives it away Modric
[2145.12 - 2150.48] P:1670.26 E:0.093010 |  but Alexander-Arnold couldn't take advantage bounces down centrally by Chetnick as well but
[2150.48 - 2155.68] P:1688.83 E:0.102746 |  then gives it to Valverde and now Real Madrid Valverde with a pass through the middle Gomez on
[2155.68 - 2162.16] P:1724.02 E:0.104391 |  the chase Gomez plays it back to Venetius oh! Alisson's clearance has gone in it's hit Venetius
[2162.48 - 2171.60] P:1540.94 E:0.107311 |  oh my goodness it's 2-2 at Anfield and Alisson's clearance charged down by Venetius Jr and
[2171.60 - 2178.64] P:1528.08 E:0.107136 |  agonisingly bounced off him and looped gently on the bounce into the back of the Liverpool
[2178.64 - 2185.60] P:1576.88 E:0.106074 |  match in front of the Cop and it's Liverpool 2 Real Madrid 2 first the error at one end
[2185.60 - 2191.12] P:1527.84 E:0.103125 |  from Courtois now one at the other from Alisson cannot believe what I'm seeing John in terms of
[2191.28 - 2197.44] P:1423.78 E:0.109574 |  the number of errors that have been made out on the pitch in this first half already from both
[2197.44 - 2202.16] P:1701.13 E:0.104689 |  keepers Courtois you mentioned a horrific error earlier on and that's another one that's all you
[2202.16 - 2205.76] P:1735.33 E:0.096968 |  can see there from Alisson I don't know what he's thinking he's trying to play the ball out
[2205.76 - 2210.96] P:1690.50 E:0.100590 |  instead of getting rid of it your team are leading just get rid and try to instead of trying to play
[2210.96 - 2217.04] P:1628.10 E:0.101680 |  it out he just wax it on to Venetius he hasn't got a clue where it's going fortunately for him
[2217.04 - 2224.40] P:1569.49 E:0.108309 |  in Real Madrid it goes in the back of the net but goodness me Alisson just clear it it's not on
[2226.96 - 2234.64] P:1540.21 E:0.095569 |  in the 14th minute Liverpool were 2-0 up and Anfield was rocking now in the 37th minute
[2235.20 - 2244.56] P:1360.06 E:0.095000 |  it's 2-2 and Venetius Jr has done it again two goals against Liverpool in the quarter
[2244.56 - 2249.60] P:1371.10 E:0.105291 |  final the season before last the winning goal in the Champions League final against Liverpool
[2250.24 - 2258.40] P:1384.06 E:0.099620 |  at the end of last season and now two goals here at Anfield to bring Carlo Ancelotti's side back from
[2261.36 - 2268.64] P:1343.41 E:0.099511 |  well they weren't on the precipice exactly but they were really rocking 2-2 what a first half
[2268.64 - 2273.60] P:1554.40 E:0.098201 |  goal but we said before the game is that because they experienced that Real Madrid have they don't
[2273.68 - 2278.64] P:1655.90 E:0.104986 |  panic in situations like this they've been in these situations before they believe that their
[2278.64 - 2285.68] P:1387.33 E:0.089713 |  ability will get them through and they didn't panic at all well that's something that Jürgen Klopp
[2285.68 - 2291.84] P:1451.52 E:0.098933 |  touched on yesterday about their pedigree pedigree of Real Madrid when you play for that club
[2293.60 - 2300.16] P:1513.15 E:0.102758 |  you're not going to lose the plot basically because it's it's drilled into you you've got a manager
[2300.16 - 2306.88] P:1480.07 E:0.104081 |  like Carlo Ancelotti who you know he's never going to be he's never going to be too much either one
[2306.88 - 2312.08] P:1471.55 E:0.101731 |  way or the other Carlo Ancelotti just about all you get from him is one eyebrow raised and then
[2312.08 - 2317.52] P:1433.59 E:0.089375 |  back it goes into place again he's very laid back isn't he isn't he uh it is still Plymouth Nill
[2317.52 - 2324.56] P:1465.91 E:0.088895 |  Cheltenham Nill by the way in the Papa John's trophy semi-final that was an eight o'clock kick
[2324.56 - 2334.08] P:1451.24 E:0.088305 |  off as well like this one so uh it's 2-2 well if this tie continues like this we've still got
[2334.08 - 2341.12] P:1683.43 E:0.093180 |  three halves of it to go then this is uh this could be anything Liverpool with it in their own
[2341.12 - 2346.24] P:1683.32 E:0.090226 |  harsh Liverpool who who've lost just once here this season in all competitions the the win for
[2346.24 - 2353.92] P:1691.63 E:0.083256 |  League United for Jesse Marsh's League United but now at 2-2 obviously anything could happen tonight
[2353.92 - 2359.52] P:1499.39 E:0.100951 |  here's Henderson on the right hand side back in field towards Alexander Arnott and Napoli have taken
[2359.52 - 2365.36] P:1613.15 E:0.088380 |  the lead against they tracked Frankfurt in Germany the Italian League leaders scoring through their
[2365.36 - 2373.92] P:1431.64 E:0.077113 |  their main man the much-wanted Victor Ossimen van Dijk to Robertson and then van Dijk in his own
[2373.92 - 2382.24] P:1454.88 E:0.089207 |  half so I tracked Frankfurt Nill Napoli one halftime around about six minutes plus added time away
[2382.24 - 2385.92] P:1499.13 E:0.092548 |  here there won't be much of that although we had the injury to Alaba he has Gatbaugh on the edge of
[2385.92 - 2390.32] P:1562.82 E:0.082825 |  the area and his Liverpool Champions League debut chest sit down but it bounces away from him
[2390.32 - 2397.76] P:1673.99 E:0.091068 |  and it's cleared away downfield by Rudiga Liverpool with Gomez it was Gomez's pass back to uh to
[2397.76 - 2402.24] P:1703.90 E:0.091115 |  Allison that led to the second finishes goal but I don't think you're going to apportion any blame
[2402.24 - 2406.32] P:1686.40 E:0.086199 |  to him he's actually done well against finishes ball played over the top down the right hand side
[2406.32 - 2412.80] P:1678.34 E:0.090301 |  drilled across by Darwin Nunez on the volley from near the dead ball line Robertson's kept it in no
[2412.80 - 2417.60] P:1662.93 E:0.098021 |  he hasn't kept it in and it's a throw in to Rayon Madrid halfway inside their own half Alan Shearer
[2418.24 - 2423.12] P:1588.07 E:0.101324 |  nearly 40 minutes gone I can't believe it I don't want it to end it's incredible what a half we've had
[2423.12 - 2428.08] P:1530.38 E:0.086746 |  we've already had 90 minutes worth of action it's unbelievable 90 minutes worth of incident it's
[2428.08 - 2432.64] P:1640.53 E:0.102476 |  incredible from from the very first minute when those players walked out onto the pitch the atmosphere
[2432.64 - 2436.80] P:1650.61 E:0.104151 |  was electric and then Liverpool went after Rayon Madrid and then we thought here we go two goals up
[2437.44 - 2442.24] P:1580.11 E:0.097417 |  but because of that experience and that know-how and they didn't panic they've got themselves back
[2442.24 - 2447.20] P:1495.48 E:0.090378 |  into the game albeit having Allison to thank. I was going to say to you when Liverpool were two in a
[2447.20 - 2453.84] P:1570.05 E:0.092534 |  look but we didn't get time didn't get the chance in Europe um under Jurgen Klopp Liverpool have played
[2453.84 - 2462.08] P:1706.01 E:0.091525 |  the first leg of European ties at home six times and they've gone through all six occasions
[2462.96 - 2469.36] P:1735.25 E:0.093935 |  however it's now 2-2 and it's right back in the balance Benzema back to Venetius Jr on a hat trick
[2469.36 - 2473.84] P:1633.26 E:0.095680 |  he wouldn't count that out comes back to Allison takes a touch and then passes it out with the
[2473.84 - 2483.12] P:1608.45 E:0.080546 |  angle at the left hand side and Robertson now rolls it forward kept in play by Milletow and then
[2483.12 - 2487.28] P:1622.15 E:0.094811 |  Carvajal running across it when the ball was off the field stops Robertson getting to it quickly
[2487.28 - 2495.68] P:1619.09 E:0.095390 |  sort of experience there and Liverpool take the throw back into their own half so dramatic night
[2495.68 - 2500.96] P:1534.28 E:0.094564 |  here at Anfield we'll hear from Germany at half-time Ian Denison and Matt Upson have made their way

[2525.44 - 2531.52] P:1693.65 E:0.090486 |  Manchester United will be at Wembley for that here's Robertson on the left hand side but
[2532.88 - 2537.52] P:1728.63 E:0.095775 |  Rodrigo's able to come across chip forward to Rodrigo who just keeps it in in front of the
[2537.52 - 2543.04] P:1759.69 E:0.107435 |  darkly dressed Carlo Ancelotti and Liverpool put it out of play for a throw in there are some seriously
[2543.04 - 2548.40] P:1462.02 E:0.099425 |  talented forward players out on that pitch tonight whether it's Salah coming on his left side on that
[2549.44 - 2554.72] P:1583.48 E:0.104213 |  from the right or whether it's Venetius Jr on the left side as well I mean there's some incredible
[2554.72 - 2560.72] P:1618.74 E:0.091979 |  football and touches and you're looking at it up close as we are here by Chet it comes in on the
[2560.72 - 2566.16] P:1661.13 E:0.099937 |  challenge with Carvajal bounces away to Núñez Camavinda now he's been fouled by Núñez because
[2566.16 - 2572.08] P:1696.40 E:0.085413 |  sprawling down the biturbo that'll be a free kick to Real Madrid in their own right back position
[2572.16 - 2578.88] P:1693.48 E:0.087896 |  so very often you'll see matches like this you know first halves like this goals action incident
[2578.88 - 2583.92] P:1600.48 E:0.097376 |  and then second half things sometimes will calm down and very often you won't see a goal in the
[2583.92 - 2588.32] P:1672.13 E:0.103890 |  second half but oh don't talk it down come on I was just gonna say I'm not making any of those
[2588.32 - 2593.20] P:1736.87 E:0.080381 |  kind of predictions with this match so there we are if you make it clear as well you won't be
[2593.20 - 2597.84] P:1651.98 E:0.097390 |  with us on Sunday you'll not have your broadcasting head on no I hopefully have some other head on
[2598.80 - 2603.20] P:1766.04 E:0.095215 |  yeah sensible head well that depends on the result on the score yeah
[2605.04 - 2612.48] P:1741.89 E:0.097426 |  two and a half minutes to go to halftime and it is Gomez who is tricked by Valverde in the centre
[2612.48 - 2617.52] P:1659.93 E:0.086504 |  circle free kick to Liverpool it absolutely love it this place to see Liverpool get back in front
[2617.52 - 2625.04] P:1690.06 E:0.077129 |  before halftime Robertson on the left hand side so far when it's got the makings of a minor classic
[2625.12 - 2633.04] P:1553.68 E:0.090114 |  here's Fabinho Fabinho moving away from Valverde sin minor because it is the last 16 here's Alexander
[2633.04 - 2639.36] P:1521.71 E:0.079883 |  Arnold on the right hand side Salas out there as well just since there's more from Salah yet in
[2639.36 - 2646.40] P:1608.37 E:0.077737 |  this match as well the way that he's been by Chetich to van Dyke and Liverpool work it to the left
[2646.40 - 2651.60] P:1683.73 E:0.090230 |  hand side to Robertson and now Nunes who's started it all with that brilliantly flicked goal to put
[2651.60 - 2656.16] P:1694.65 E:0.094913 |  Liverpool one the look in the fourth minute cleared by Real Madrid but only to by Chetich who
[2656.16 - 2660.08] P:1582.72 E:0.097944 |  angles it through to Alexander Arnold who's in the middle bounces back to by Chetich he slips
[2660.08 - 2667.20] P:1822.71 E:0.103536 |  as he plays it four big shots for Hanpoor from everyone in a red scarf and the referee says
[2667.20 - 2672.72] P:1663.94 E:0.084687 |  yes it was a Hanpoor Real Madrid don't like that decision Modric several of them around
[2672.72 - 2678.08] P:1638.94 E:0.082526 |  the referee complaining about that I'm not sure there's much Modric could have done about that
[2678.08 - 2684.08] P:1613.69 E:0.089162 |  no he's rather close wasn't it oh that's a that is a that's a bonus what a half he's had though
[2684.08 - 2689.92] P:1651.18 E:0.090729 |  by Chetich yeah brilliant 18 years of age how comfortable is he look on the ball in every position
[2689.92 - 2696.32] P:1767.24 E:0.087055 |  take the under pressure spraying it around they're like that at that age though Alan I'm not sure I
[2696.32 - 2701.20] P:1753.60 E:0.100589 |  was like that and then when they get a little bit older suddenly you're aware of all of the
[2702.08 - 2708.24] P:1815.75 E:0.091132 |  the things that can go wrong well Trent Alexander Arnold's already scored with a brilliant free
[2708.24 - 2712.96] P:1687.48 E:0.092113 |  kick in this Champions League campaign remember the goal against Rangers it wasn't far away from here
[2712.96 - 2720.16] P:1592.20 E:0.082052 |  I think maybe slightly to the left and slightly closer from from memory but good position for him
[2721.12 - 2728.80] P:1598.96 E:0.088499 |  it'll be approaching 20 25 yards out and he's now got the ball in his hands the Champions League ball
[2729.52 - 2734.40] P:1720.09 E:0.091132 |  leans over bends down gives it a bounce on the floor catches it and then puts it in position
[2735.44 - 2741.60] P:1737.48 E:0.089145 |  and now two three steps away to his left Real Madrid wall just outside the box
[2742.24 - 2746.96] P:1791.31 E:0.097294 |  Alexander Arnold with the free kick for Liverpool curls it around the wall but close enough to
[2746.96 - 2753.12] P:1808.36 E:0.086085 |  Courtois to be able to kick a couple of little steps to his right and tap it down yeah he read
[2753.12 - 2758.56] P:1582.00 E:0.094926 |  it well didn't he so I thought it was gone then it did Valverde now is Real Madrid break for it
[2758.56 - 2764.88] P:1796.91 E:0.108150 |  he has finished us again pulls it across Rodrigo in the middle and a crucial tackle by Robertson
[2764.88 - 2772.40] P:1818.89 E:0.095838 |  in the six yard box just as Rodrigo was thinking he was going to put Real Madrid in front wow what
[2772.40 - 2777.52] P:1665.39 E:0.097349 |  a tackle from Robertson at that far post they do to Liverpool what Liverpool like to do to other
[2777.52 - 2781.92] P:1766.18 E:0.096411 |  teams is hit them on the break down the left hand side with Vinicius and he whips that ball in and
[2781.92 - 2787.44] P:1705.60 E:0.098892 |  Rodrigo's just about to tap it in two yards out Robertson gets his toe there and kicks it out for
[2787.44 - 2793.92] P:1699.74 E:0.086932 |  a corner absolutely crucial moment defensively for Liverpool from Robertson corner then
[2793.92 - 2799.20] P:1655.71 E:0.094045 |  Modric the out swinger is over Ruder get headed away by van Dijk behind him and now Liverpool
[2799.20 - 2804.40] P:1757.27 E:0.109410 |  look to break all the salad back heals it to Alexander Arnold who whips the ball forward
[2804.40 - 2810.40] P:1757.19 E:0.092919 |  long and forward to Núñez Núñez Carvajal backs away from him he leaves it actually to Modric
[2810.40 - 2815.44] P:1799.32 E:0.095285 |  Núñez now taking the ball into the full back position still against Modric onto his right foot
[2815.52 - 2821.68] P:1753.66 E:0.082911 |  plays it back up the line to by Cetic square from him to the Shaven headed Brazilian Fabinho
[2821.68 - 2827.28] P:1637.77 E:0.092276 |  and then back to van Dijk who will just pull the ball to the right hand side to Gomez we're
[2827.28 - 2832.32] P:1643.27 E:0.090615 |  into added time at the end of the first half Henderson now slips the ball past the defender
[2832.32 - 2837.04] P:1753.72 E:0.095420 |  still going Henderson dive comes in I think from Valverde I thought it might have struck him on the
[2837.04 - 2840.88] P:1699.05 E:0.095322 |  arm but it bounced behind you can't if don't otherwise we would have heard about it from
[2841.36 - 2846.40] P:1682.43 E:0.083729 |  the Liverpool supporters and in the end it's a goal kick well the game is so open both teams
[2846.40 - 2852.72] P:1672.16 E:0.081205 |  struggling defensively I just thought that the midfield a lack of protection from from both teams
[2852.72 - 2856.88] P:1768.53 E:0.088404 |  and when Liverpool go go throw they look such a threat and exactly the same with Real Madrid
[2856.88 - 2859.92] P:1921.72 E:0.093232 |  when they attack Liverpool at this cop end you think every time they're going to score
[2860.96 - 2868.24] P:1658.11 E:0.078659 |  that was a huge moment the the Rodrigo chance that Robertson only had to get that right and
[2868.24 - 2874.64] P:1678.60 E:0.082194 |  somehow was able to deflect it I mean the goal was almost at Rodrigo's mercy if he'd been able
[2874.64 - 2881.20] P:1665.52 E:0.086366 |  to get past Robertson but he blocked it wide and behind long and forward for Liverpool the Núñez
[2881.20 - 2887.20] P:1596.02 E:0.080936 |  near the edge of the box and then Rudiger is able to clear and the ball bounces out of play on the
[2887.20 - 2892.32] P:1697.13 E:0.088261 |  far side for a throw in to Liverpool in the third minute of added time now at the end of the first
[2892.32 - 2898.08] P:1718.05 E:0.094868 |  half three minutes were indicated and here's Salah on the right hand side twisting turning
[2898.08 - 2903.84] P:1704.91 E:0.100536 |  might have been fouled by Rudiger referee says play on Fabinho left footed Núñez put too much on
[2903.84 - 2908.64] P:1646.89 E:0.099768 |  that and it drift away he's saying that it might have taken a touch off the head of it
[2908.64 - 2913.52] P:1754.29 E:0.093627 |  around the great defender but it's goal kick that is given by referee Kovac I think the one
[2913.52 - 2918.40] P:1633.26 E:0.087823 |  with the free kick because Salah was upended I think it was Rudiger it was that took him out there
[2918.48 - 2922.40] P:1652.73 E:0.085281 |  and that's what the Liverpool fan their players were moaning out the referee that's Henderson's
[2922.40 - 2928.00] P:1604.83 E:0.079704 |  got actually gone across to speak to the referee and is making the point that we would have we would
[2928.00 - 2932.24] P:1635.34 E:0.095500 |  have preferred a free kick in the full back position there it was a really dangerous position if they
[2932.24 - 2936.00] P:1628.81 E:0.097398 |  had a given it as well that's what they wanted and should have had yeah well the referee's actually
[2936.00 - 2940.80] P:1829.89 E:0.108739 |  played two or three very good advantages in that first half so he's maybe getting a bit giddy with
[2940.80 - 2947.12] P:1635.99 E:0.104610 |  that and thought he would let it go there as well but there we are that that has been a thoroughly
[2947.12 - 2953.60] P:1458.96 E:0.106208 |  entertaining first half of Champions League football two to the score Liverpool two nil up the early
[2953.60 - 2959.76] P:1317.33 E:0.103871 |  goal from Núñez that was a brilliant flick from from Salah's pass and then Salah himself
[2960.48 - 2966.48] P:1549.47 E:0.107091 |  scoring the second after a monumental error by Tivol Courtois who miscontrolled it straight
[2966.48 - 2973.28] P:1376.02 E:0.106541 |  into the path of Salah but then Real Madrid and Venetius had their great moments a super finish
[2973.36 - 2978.96] P:1548.90 E:0.100831 |  from Venetius just when it seemed that Real Madrid were were out of it but they're never out of it
[2978.96 - 2982.80] P:1693.15 E:0.110479 |  brilliant goal low cross shot and then the error from Alisson at the other end
[2984.48 - 2988.96] P:1551.18 E:0.110298 |  straight into Venetius with his clearance and the ball bounced into the net and that crucial
[2988.96 - 2993.68] P:1273.97 E:0.110588 |  clearance as well in the end from Robinson off Venetius but I don't know what you want to pick
[2993.68 - 2998.64] P:1620.77 E:0.109713 |  out from that Alan but take your pick well the cameras didn't know who to pan on to there at the
[2998.64 - 3003.20] P:1699.55 E:0.102610 |  end the first of all the they went to Tivol Courtois for his error and then of course when
[3003.20 - 3008.32] P:1665.26 E:0.104607 |  Alisson was near in the the changing rooms they've sort of panned on to to him that doesn't tell us
[3008.32 - 3013.92] P:1549.70 E:0.102895 |  the the true story though there's been some fantastic forward play from Salah and from from
[3013.92 - 3019.28] P:1748.69 E:0.104675 |  from Núñez in several occasions but the star of the show in that first half was Venetius Tuna
[3019.28 - 3024.48] P:1614.89 E:0.104613 |  every time he got that ball out on the left hand side he's looked so dangerous but what a half it's
[3024.48 - 3032.88] P:1538.38 E:0.097950 |  been more of a say in the second please so Liverpool to Real Madrid to I'm intrigued to know
[3032.88 - 3039.36] P:1520.05 E:0.112927 |  where Kelly is going to go first with you after that what what are you thinking I'll be honest I
[3039.36 - 3043.28] P:1589.74 E:0.111346 |  was just listening to what you were saying and trying to try to pick up the pieces I mean what an
[3043.28 - 3049.04] P:1414.18 E:0.102206 |  extraordinary first half how do you even start to make sense of that there were yes defensive issues
[3049.04 - 3053.60] P:1383.68 E:0.106843 |  that you highlighted in commentary and yes there were goalkeeping errors from both Courtois
[3053.60 - 3059.68] P:1399.53 E:0.104139 |  and from Alisson but as you touched on there with Venetius Jr the attacking play in this game
[3059.68 - 3065.28] P:1583.89 E:0.101987 |  has been fantastic Alan it has from from both sides Kelly particularly from Liverpool down that
[3065.28 - 3070.00] P:1652.71 E:0.102928 |  right hand side with Salah and his link up play whether it's Henderson or little one twos with
[3070.00 - 3074.96] P:1779.77 E:0.106375 |  by Chechich or Trent Alexander-Arnold they've got their number in that position and they look so
[3074.96 - 3080.40] P:1754.40 E:0.101906 |  dangerous but on the other side of that Real Madrid down their left hand side with Venetius Jr
[3080.40 - 3085.84] P:1707.46 E:0.104422 |  the little one twos with Modric and and Benzemaar while what a player a great technique and the
[3085.84 - 3090.40] P:1836.82 E:0.100979 |  yeah that his first goal when he had no right to get his shot away when there was two or three
[3090.40 - 3094.96] P:1641.59 E:0.105678 |  Liverpool defenders around him and for him to manage to to get it past Alisson and bend it
[3094.96 - 3101.36] P:1586.14 E:0.104046 |  into that far post incredible ability so yeah what a half yeah what a half as well and on most Salah
[3101.36 - 3106.88] P:1431.10 E:0.100813 |  as well that's 44 goals in the Champions League that's the joint highest tally for an African player
[3106.88 - 3112.08] P:1439.94 E:0.103057 |  level with Didier Drogba now he's got past Stephen Gerrard's European goal scoring record for
[3112.08 - 3117.12] P:1485.98 E:0.105760 |  for Liverpool and he's a player who started the season slowly as many of the Liverpool side did
[3117.12 - 3125.84] P:1537.59 E:0.085966 |  but seems to be coming back into form he probably won't get an easy one not Kelly Olly
[3125.84 - 3130.00] P:1667.87 E:0.113044 |  I tell you what Alan you do need a break and I know you also need to get your monitors fixed
[3130.00 - 3134.40] P:1570.34 E:0.113316 |  Alan Shearer and John Murray our Anfield for us we've got Adam Lalani
[3134.40 - 3140.72] P:1570.82 E:0.102909 |  Kelly the match has blown up the monitor we've got Adam Lalani joining us as well of course at
[3140.72 - 3145.28] P:1454.68 E:0.096801 |  Brighton now but former Liverpool player has been part of some of these big nights at Anfield in
[3145.28 - 3151.52] P:1856.61 E:0.083289 |  the Champions League but Adam this one has been a special 45 minutes cause why do you're wetting
[3151.52 - 3159.12] P:1879.65 E:0.071817 |  on me there again Kelly yeah no it was definitely Alan what what a first half I mean Alan said he
[3159.20 - 3165.76] P:1680.94 E:0.074023 |  expected goals and there was goals and a lot more I mean it it went exactly how Liverpool and
[3165.76 - 3172.80] P:1793.57 E:0.066759 |  Jurgen would have wanted the game to go fast start fans were up two goals and they just they'll be so
[3172.80 - 3177.60] P:1727.70 E:0.084405 |  disappointed they let them back in I mean you said about Madrid's first goal there was a lot of bodies
[3177.60 - 3184.00] P:1728.06 E:0.072245 |  around it I just think Gomez Gomez will be slightly disappointed he went he went to block the ball with
[3184.08 - 3191.04] P:1876.44 E:0.069394 |  his wrong foot but a hell of a finish fantastic finish hell of a finish junior and he's just had a
[3191.04 - 3196.08] P:1918.57 E:0.077813 |  brilliant first half he's the youngest visiting player to score twice against Liverpool at Anfield
[3196.08 - 3202.80] P:1916.82 E:0.081301 |  in a major European competition since Johan Cruyff in December 1906 when he played for for IACS and
[3202.80 - 3208.48] P:1882.84 E:0.090501 |  it was a brilliant first half for him from Liverpool as Alan Shearer was saying there were so many
[3208.48 - 3212.80] P:2071.68 E:0.087534 |  opportunities for them do you feel that if we're going to be picky here they could have been a bit
[3212.80 - 3218.24] P:1614.28 E:0.081856 |  more clinical maybe yeah like down Liverpool's right hand side you know Jordan was making overlapping
[3218.24 - 3223.76] P:1593.16 E:0.076908 |  runs that they had a couple of other attempts on goal but I think to to be too in the lap at home
[3223.76 - 3230.00] P:1728.71 E:0.072805 |  to Madrid you'd take that you've just got to be a bit more solid and consolidate at the back and
[3230.00 - 3236.56] P:1671.91 E:0.076332 |  I'm surprised they've let them back in as early as they have obviously the momentum's now shifted
[3236.56 - 3240.56] P:1858.59 E:0.089485 |  probably slightly with Madrid so it'll be interesting to see how the second half plays out
[3241.52 - 3246.08] P:1754.59 E:0.088874 |  and obviously Salah's goal came from the error from from Courtois and then Madrid's second goal
[3246.08 - 3251.44] P:1907.55 E:0.088713 |  came from the error from from Allison who's got Liverpool out of so many difficult situations
[3251.44 - 3258.32] P:1776.16 E:0.066466 |  so far this season but this time he has to hold his hands up doesn't he yeah and he will he's the
[3258.32 - 3262.72] P:1449.40 E:0.081288 |  type of guy that will hold his hands up he's you know he's honest he'll come in and he'll react
[3262.72 - 3268.40] P:1687.04 E:0.065018 |  well from it it's um it was so surprising for that to happen especially after Courtois had a
[3269.20 - 3275.12] P:1739.21 E:0.074696 |  moment of madness or as what you'd call but um yeah he just kicked it straight into
[3276.24 - 3281.36] P:1889.60 E:0.076551 |  into the player and it's gone gone straight in the net very surprised the thing is you don't get
[3281.36 - 3287.20] P:1760.45 E:0.086576 |  the impression that this game is going to slow down the second half do you I hope not as well not
[3287.20 - 3293.76] P:1671.69 E:0.070922 |  for us and not for the for everyone watching it was you know magnificent tie and exactly what
[3293.76 - 3299.60] P:1992.06 E:0.077914 |  what the Champions League deserves Adam for now thank you very much Adam Lallana with us on five
[3299.60 - 3305.44] P:1820.56 E:0.093296 |  live sport is Liverpool to Real Madrid to at Anfield and there's another 45 minutes of that game
[3305.44 - 3310.00] P:1942.73 E:0.078328 |  still to come we'll be looking ahead to that one in the second half should kick off in less than
[3310.00 - 3315.20] P:1868.06 E:0.084110 |  10 minutes I think at Anfield we're bringing up to date with the other score in the Champions League
[3315.20 - 3321.12] P:1851.20 E:0.088970 |  between Frankfurt and Napoli very shortly it's also a busy night in the EFL Aaron Paul is at the

[3325.20 - 3329.12] P:1827.12 E:0.098325 |  Millwall Neil Burnley won the visitors finally get the goal they've been looking for it's come
[3329.12 - 3334.08] P:1830.23 E:0.100603 |  courtesy of Ashley Barnes Burnley worked the ball into the Millwall box right to Lev Zeruri
[3334.08 - 3339.12] P:1796.45 E:0.090202 |  to Scott Twine who shot initially from around the penalty spot that can end off a defender up
[3339.12 - 3344.32] P:1755.38 E:0.091970 |  into the air and into the path of Ashley Barnes who smashed it past George Long in front of those
[3344.32 - 3350.88] P:1846.28 E:0.088637 |  Burnley fans to my left but Millwall have a free kick and a very promising position to my right

[3587.52 - 3592.00] P:1520.91 E:0.090119 |  without both de Bruyne and Le Porte because here in Germany tonight Pep Guardiola has revealed
[3592.00 - 3596.48] P:1691.62 E:0.078887 |  that they're going to miss the game through illness and indeed they are now doubtful for the weekend
[3596.48 - 3600.80] P:1849.35 E:0.079061 |  trip to Bournemouth in the Premier League but it's the champions league of course that we're
[3600.80 - 3606.08] P:1719.67 E:0.080113 |  going to be concentrating on and is a competition that Guardiola has had so much success in as a
[3606.08 - 3610.88] P:1675.85 E:0.082252 |  player and as a manager although his last triumph was actually 12 years ago but you're going to hear
[3610.88 - 3618.16] P:1918.70 E:0.079956 |  him now in a rather philosophical mood a reflective mood and also one in which he reveals interestingly
[3618.16 - 3624.08] P:1789.02 E:0.073300 |  regarding a change of mentality since he's been in charge at Manchester City I would say is my
[3624.08 - 3630.40] P:1806.61 E:0.077760 |  career finished tomorrow literally tomorrow are we more than blessed and grateful what I've done with
[3630.40 - 3635.20] P:1803.90 E:0.081820 |  the Barcelona Bayern Munich and here in Europe and a competition so I could never have a spect
[3635.92 - 3642.00] P:1842.40 E:0.086091 |  to have the career I had in the short time I don't know how far we go but the dream is go forward
[3642.00 - 3646.64] P:1685.39 E:0.086527 |  to do a good game tomorrow go to the quarterfinals so this is the point but of course it's a nice
[3646.64 - 3653.92] P:1743.47 E:0.101641 |  competition you know it's in England you can take a plane we dress beautiful to fly and we wanted to
[3653.92 - 3659.52] P:1780.17 E:0.075985 |  do our best and our best I have the illusion to do a quarterfinals it's going to happen it's going to
[3659.52 - 3665.28] P:1675.80 E:0.084183 |  happen so at the end the destiny is already written and we do our best all the work they have done we
[3665.28 - 3670.80] P:1786.00 E:0.091266 |  have been closed sometimes not sometimes closer so whatever I'm doing personally with the future
[3670.80 - 3675.84] P:1921.18 E:0.077755 |  whatever I've done despite I'm going to fail nothing will be enough so that's why when I learned that
[3675.84 - 3680.16] P:1834.59 E:0.084607 |  I mentioned that we just have fun and joy being here and this press conference after a good dinner
[3680.16 - 3686.40] P:1844.25 E:0.079248 |  with good wine and watch Madrid and Liverpool Liverpool Madrid prepare well the game let them
[3686.40 - 3692.72] P:1903.94 E:0.067982 |  feel the players let's go guys try to do it again again and and that's all so that was Pep Guardiola
[3692.72 - 3697.12] P:1532.70 E:0.078662 |  and here we are back in Leipzig and with me is the former England international defender
[3697.12 - 3703.44] P:1656.81 E:0.066164 |  Matthew Uppson and Matt Guardiola there basically talking about the pressure that Manchester City
[3703.44 - 3707.20] P:1759.78 E:0.077173 |  are as a club that they've got to try and win everything and he's he revealed that change of
[3707.20 - 3712.48] P:1860.64 E:0.061876 |  mentality that he's just going to enjoy it you've got to admire that haven't you yeah I think you
[3712.48 - 3718.24] P:1523.05 E:0.065217 |  have to admire it but also perhaps it's essential and perhaps that's the reason why he's having this
[3718.24 - 3722.88] P:1811.52 E:0.071482 |  change of philosophy because the pressure can sometimes be too much and ultimately when when
[3722.88 - 3727.36] P:1677.84 E:0.080130 |  you do your best and you prepare your best and give it everything you can then you see where you lie
[3727.36 - 3732.40] P:1611.30 E:0.065004 |  and Manchester City for me are a team that if they do that they're capable of winning the Champions
[3732.72 - 3738.24] P:1679.20 E:0.068686 |  League which is what they want ultimately so it's a slight change of reflection I understand that
[3738.24 - 3743.04] P:1518.35 E:0.064339 |  maybe that's to let the players know that of course they want to win but also they just want to go
[3743.04 - 3747.68] P:1566.40 E:0.071670 |  out and do their best give it give the best account of themselves they possibly can and see what happens
[3747.68 - 3751.68] P:1533.37 E:0.081790 |  the only trouble is if he's trying to play it all down and he's saying I'm going to enjoy it I'm
[3751.68 - 3755.76] P:1336.79 E:0.090326 |  going to have good company I'm going to watch the Liverpool game and we'll have a glass of red wine
[3755.76 - 3761.52] P:1694.62 E:0.071586 |  which certainly I have to admire that the only thing is is that minutes beforehand in the same room
[3761.52 - 3765.76] P:1670.75 E:0.080250 |  Nathan Ackie was talking about it's quite clear over the last few years this is obvious this is the
[3765.76 - 3772.24] P:1763.91 E:0.070153 |  trophy we want to win so it quite clearly is is the trophy that they crave and the players know it
[3772.24 - 3778.08] P:1502.89 E:0.064700 |  yeah of course I think everyone at the club knows it Guardiola has a great history with the
[3778.96 - 3784.72] P:1642.31 E:0.070083 |  Champions League and hasn't won it with Manchester City so I'm sure he's desperate too but I think
[3784.72 - 3790.80] P:1667.98 E:0.071426 |  that is that is more for for himself for the players even though Nathan Ackie may say that but I
[3790.80 - 3796.24] P:1729.52 E:0.068407 |  think it's just a message for everyone to say look we're not we're not robots we're not super human
[3796.24 - 3800.64] P:1555.16 E:0.078125 |  but we're going to go and do our best and if we do our best we're capable of winning so
[3800.64 - 3804.64] P:1678.19 E:0.081907 |  it's a slightly more relaxed approach to what he's trying to say but I'm sure behind the scenes is
[3804.64 - 3812.32] P:1800.07 E:0.072153 |  his usual intense self thank you very much to Ian Dennis and to Matt Upson commentary of RB Leipzig

[3912.40 - 3918.16] P:1586.04 E:0.100550 |  path of Carvajal who will clear it away Camarvinga now running but he's been chopped down by Henderson

[3942.16 - 3947.76] P:1722.67 E:0.106180 |  position Gomez comes across quite a strong challenge yeah it's given us a free kick I can see why
[3947.84 - 3953.20] P:1697.07 E:0.097712 |  they're disappointed Real Madrid fans are behind that the the line of that for the referee they were
[3953.20 - 3957.20] P:1717.86 E:0.091054 |  up in arms whether that played a part but I think it was a free kick it was a free kick I thought it
[3957.20 - 3962.08] P:1803.08 E:0.091410 |  was yeah he's carried on as he just left the first half Venetius first touch gets that ball goes on
[3962.08 - 3966.32] P:1795.52 E:0.091593 |  behind the defender says what you got and he wins his team a free kick in a dangerous position

[3986.24 - 3992.56] P:1690.34 E:0.084057 |  his socks standing just near the dead ball line Liverpool have packed the six yard box
[3993.20 - 3998.40] P:1689.13 E:0.092186 |  Rudiger's making a nuisance of himself in there waiting for the delivery here it comes from
[3998.40 - 4006.72] P:1606.92 E:0.105776 |  Modric plays it in line it's headed in at the near post and it's three two to Real Madrid and
[4006.72 - 4014.00] P:1661.94 E:0.104610 |  Adam Militao the central defender stolen in amongst all of those red shirts and Carlo
[4014.00 - 4021.84] P:1608.73 E:0.106705 |  Angelotti's Real Madrid have come from two nil down here at Anfield to lead three two well I said
[4021.84 - 4026.40] P:1726.36 E:0.107618 |  it was in a dangerous position I didn't think he'd get a free header Militao like he did there's no
[4026.48 - 4032.40] P:1688.14 E:0.106828 |  around him Liverpool players are all static he just runs in unchallenged unmarked says thank you
[4032.40 - 4041.20] P:1417.46 E:0.102827 |  very much free header three yards out three two good ball in from Modric he whips it in there
[4041.20 - 4047.84] P:1545.05 E:0.099481 |  but Militao he just drifts in there there's no one even with him comes from the far post gets in
[4047.84 - 4054.16] P:1669.99 E:0.106919 |  between the Liverpool defenders gets it on target simple goal far far too simple from a Liverpool
[4054.16 - 4059.60] P:1591.58 E:0.104127 |  point of view Alan that's like I mean it's like defending against statues
[4061.04 - 4064.08] P:1663.98 E:0.109823 |  the statues would have had more movement I think than the Liverpool defenders there
[4065.04 - 4066.24] P:1381.91 E:0.113571 |  and that's remarkable
[4068.24 - 4074.00] P:1455.10 E:0.100451 |  Liverpool defenders you know had their positions and Militao just ran in in between them and
[4074.00 - 4078.96] P:1743.99 E:0.093687 |  headed it in well we spoke before the game about Newcastle winning every set piece at the weekend
[4078.96 - 4091.12] P:1593.97 E:0.097870 |  with 10 men as Gomez hands off Vinicius 15 yards inside the the Liverpool half what a turn of
[4091.12 - 4097.68] P:1651.39 E:0.091559 |  events this is Liverpool to Real Madrid three that goal three minutes into the second half
[4098.80 - 4104.88] P:1550.55 E:0.102985 |  and Jordan Henderson has come across to to argue Gomez's case but there was an arm wasn't there
[4105.36 - 4110.64] P:1466.93 E:0.104488 |  there was an arm that caught him that wasn't a yellow card I don't think it was
[4111.20 - 4115.44] P:1661.01 E:0.095378 |  so it's a free kick to Real Madrid that Modric who took the free kick for that third goal
[4116.88 - 4124.96] P:1687.04 E:0.094939 |  so after 15 minutes Liverpool were winning 2-0 and and honestly if you weren't listening then
[4124.96 - 4131.28] P:1556.60 E:0.089172 |  the noise inside Anfield was was something else but Real Madrid the champions the European
[4131.28 - 4138.08] P:1679.04 E:0.087605 |  champions the recently crowned club world cup winners they have shown their character shown
[4138.08 - 4143.28] P:1626.41 E:0.082764 |  what they're all about really Modric playing the ball down into the Liverpool left-back position
[4143.28 - 4147.36] P:1616.25 E:0.091996 |  where it's controlled by van Dijk and played forward and then Robertson wins a throwing
[4148.00 - 4150.64] P:1698.38 E:0.108997 |  and I can't help but look down there on Carlo Ancelotti
[4152.64 - 4158.48] P:1495.68 E:0.113231 |  obviously one of his most agonizing days in football despite all of his champions the final
[4158.48 - 4165.12] P:1456.99 E:0.105146 |  wins was probably the one that he didn't win when his AC Milan side well you know the rest
[4166.24 - 4172.08] P:1563.74 E:0.112372 |  and now look at this look what his team has done here at Anfield how much must he be enjoying this
[4172.64 - 4178.40] P:1668.20 E:0.089986 |  there's that gap was chopped down on the halfway line and Eda Milleau is going to be told off
[4179.04 - 4185.04] P:1610.40 E:0.089712 |  and that's a final warning from the Romanian referee Istvan Kovac on the halfway line I see
[4185.04 - 4192.00] P:1730.09 E:0.086724 |  Rotherham are winning 2-1 now against Sunderland so they got themselves 2-0 but Joe Gellar to score
[4192.00 - 4200.16] P:1502.44 E:0.081603 |  I think this first goal for Sunderland on loan from Leeds Rotherham to Sunderland 1 and Liverpool
[4200.16 - 4205.12] P:1719.65 E:0.097445 |  with it on the right hand side five-life final scoring operation tonight in full swing as well
[4205.12 - 4210.72] P:1567.64 E:0.093949 |  it's on all outlets red button iPlayer BBC sport website and app to listen to the five-life commentary
[4210.72 - 4216.72] P:1493.16 E:0.096746 |  on this match alongside the Vidi Printer in the final score graphics rail Madrid with their Valverdeu
[4216.72 - 4221.60] P:1748.33 E:0.094558 |  turns into trouble turns into Gatpole so Liverpool in the second half attacking towards the Cop they
[4221.60 - 4225.92] P:1686.26 E:0.089924 |  need them they need everything now just going back to that goal that they've just conceded I mean
[4225.92 - 4230.80] P:1681.90 E:0.097561 |  you can't defend like that at any level let alone against one of the best teams in European football
[4230.80 - 4236.16] P:1591.59 E:0.093531 |  with some of the best players in European football you've got to get tight it's simple from a from a
[4236.64 - 4245.60] P:1564.10 E:0.084019 |  set piece just outside the box pick up your man Liverpool to rail Madrid three and he has
[4245.60 - 4250.48] P:1617.01 E:0.101882 |  Venetius on the left hand side plays the ball into Henderson who moved his right foot across
[4250.48 - 4256.64] P:1645.95 E:0.091955 |  caught the ball on it but that's centered spinning behind for another corner to rail Madrid so this
[4256.64 - 4262.80] P:1596.29 E:0.090032 |  is another another set piece for Liverpool to have to defend and it's been hard in mouth stuff this
[4263.36 - 4269.20] P:1578.20 E:0.089430 |  this is really what we were talking about at St James's Park if you were listening on on Saturday
[4269.20 - 4276.72] P:1571.23 E:0.082761 |  evening to the commentary about the vulnerability at the back corner is taken short actually by
[4277.36 - 4282.88] P:1617.10 E:0.088827 |  Modric to Venetius Venetius gets it back Modric as well Benzema is out there that's a slight worry
[4282.88 - 4288.48] P:1652.23 E:0.094475 |  for Liverpool that Benzema has not got in on the act yet as Modric slings over the cross which
[4288.48 - 4296.96] P:1632.07 E:0.091668 |  lands beyond the far post and behind for a goal kick to Liverpool so a goal kick it is that Alison
[4296.96 - 4305.84] P:1563.19 E:0.103570 |  passes out then back to Van Gaik inside the area and field absolutely packed here tonight of course
[4305.84 - 4313.68] P:1547.53 E:0.102730 |  it would be from match like this a night like this Liverpool who have not won in their last six
[4313.68 - 4320.24] P:1549.63 E:0.090579 |  matches against rail Madrid all of them in the Champions League after 15 minutes I've looked as
[4320.24 - 4326.24] P:1576.12 E:0.088333 |  though that might be coming to an end and Liverpool were going to have some triumph against rail Madrid
[4326.24 - 4335.28] P:1587.95 E:0.096233 |  but now they will do very well to turn this around to a winning position again but it has been
[4336.56 - 4342.16] P:1537.10 E:0.094995 |  it's been a night it's been a fraught night and it's one of those evenings where I don't know about
[4342.16 - 4346.64] P:1679.91 E:0.112545 |  you Alan I think probably there will be more goals and Alexander-Arnold plays it across
[4346.64 - 4351.92] P:1784.93 E:0.107557 |  and Munez was arriving might have been shoved in the back by Carvajal when sprawling in the box
[4351.92 - 4356.56] P:1739.65 E:0.106200 |  he's gone down referee Corbatch is not interested in that I think he's going to leave it to VAR
[4357.68 - 4361.60] P:1520.07 E:0.098465 |  yeah I didn't think it was a penalty I thought he was looking for it Gatpole now with it on the left
[4361.60 - 4365.52] P:1668.08 E:0.090474 |  hand side three defenders with him he's managed to find the ball to Robertson Robertson's ball
[4365.52 - 4370.40] P:1738.86 E:0.098996 |  across his block to the edge of the penalty area Modric getting it away and then it's swung away
[4370.88 - 4375.84] P:1805.44 E:0.105739 |  thrashed away on the volley halfway up the lower tier of the Saqenidar Glice stand
[4375.84 - 4380.88] P:1555.91 E:0.087886 |  and they've got the ball back quickly Liverpool Henderson now middle of the half almost
[4381.68 - 4386.40] P:1526.71 E:0.092846 |  high ball out to the right hand side to Alexander-Arnold Alexander-Arnold when Liverpool have
[4386.40 - 4390.72] P:1699.68 E:0.090660 |  probed and put rail Madrid under pressure they've caused problems that's what they're trying to do
[4390.72 - 4396.16] P:1698.68 E:0.101289 |  now Henderson's ball to the back post is headed out by Rodrigo five or six yards from the corner
[4396.16 - 4404.64] P:1476.86 E:0.083950 |  flag Robertson takes a quick throw back to by Cetic in field it comes to Fabinho Fabinho the tall
[4404.64 - 4410.08] P:1446.94 E:0.095390 |  number three just turns to his left the teenager by Cetic is there with the red socks down near his
[4410.08 - 4415.92] P:1411.76 E:0.097052 |  ankles now to Alexander-Arnold who beats Venetius left-footed ball in onto the head of Rudiger
[4415.92 - 4420.64] P:1597.08 E:0.098076 |  who got good distance on that header and Henderson if he's not careful he's going to be beaten to it
[4420.64 - 4426.24] P:1674.98 E:0.108428 |  by Venetius and that's it a short back pass but he hasn't had to be fouled by Venetius I think
[4426.24 - 4429.76] P:1525.53 E:0.093053 |  there's going to be a little fortunate to get that but he's got it and it's a three kick to Liverpool
[4429.76 - 4434.16] P:1675.23 E:0.107212 |  they're petrified by Venetius every time he gets that ball even when he hasn't got the ball and he's
[4434.16 - 4438.56] P:1690.79 E:0.094679 |  closing the Liverpool pool players down they're just petrified anywhere he goes near them
[4440.48 - 4445.60] P:1462.86 E:0.098901 |  I watched their game on Saturday night against Dossasuner and he was I mean he is right on the
[4445.60 - 4451.28] P:1592.06 E:0.097403 |  top of his game at the moment such a talent right top scorer now this season 18 goals for
[4451.28 - 4457.36] P:1617.04 E:0.092658 |  Real Madrid memory got 22 last season including the one that won the Champions League final
[4457.36 - 4461.36] P:1639.03 E:0.105905 |  now here's Carvajal playing the ball over the top down the right hand side that's for Rodrigo the
[4461.36 - 4465.04] P:1804.58 E:0.100656 |  other Brazilian on the other side to run onto Rodrigo is there he's got a bit of space as well
[4465.04 - 4470.56] P:1733.36 E:0.090766 |  Robertson's back in position the cutback intercepted by by Cetic Carvajal gives it back to Rodrigo
[4470.56 - 4475.28] P:1609.58 E:0.101199 |  now here's Benzema look out Liverpool Benzema gets it back left footed shot deflected in
[4476.96 - 4483.44] P:1541.08 E:0.113978 |  Alisson tried to react but the deflection beat him outstretched the Liverpool goalkeeper got
[4483.44 - 4489.60] P:1347.67 E:0.108748 |  something on it but he couldn't prevent it bouncing into the back of the Liverpool net
[4490.32 - 4498.48] P:1558.29 E:0.106229 |  and now it's Liverpool 2 Real Madrid 4 and Benzema via the deflection has given Real Madrid a clear
[4499.44 - 4504.56] P:1492.12 E:0.108905 |  turn there was a disaster this for Liverpool tonight they play the ball really well they
[4504.56 - 4508.72] P:1886.64 E:0.106458 |  work it really well down there at their right hand side little one two giving go to Benzema
[4508.72 - 4513.76] P:1761.62 E:0.095204 |  who just takes a little pot shot really with that left foot and the Liverpool defender closing
[4513.76 - 4518.64] P:1849.84 E:0.095146 |  them down in Gomez goes to close them down and just sticks that left foot out sticks the little
[4518.64 - 4522.64] P:1867.62 E:0.102798 |  heel out and it hits that heel and Alisson's already gone and he can't get back into the
[4522.64 - 4528.96] P:1572.23 E:0.085937 |  middle of the goal and just watches the goal for the ball go past him he was already committed
[4528.96 - 4534.24] P:1569.13 E:0.092160 |  the VAR are having a look at offside here but I think it's going to be onside Rodrigo when he
[4534.24 - 4542.32] P:1585.49 E:0.094769 |  burst down the right and Alisson in the six yard box diving to his left was diving to his right
[4542.32 - 4549.68] P:1575.07 E:0.096649 |  was it was already committed and then the deflection off Gomez just okay there's nothing
[4549.68 - 4554.24] P:1790.77 E:0.102754 |  Alisson could do about that he did his best he got a touch on it I feel for Gomez as well he's
[4554.24 - 4560.64] P:1654.29 E:0.096085 |  unfortunate there he was probably not tight enough we were saying at halftime Alan as Alan Adam
[4560.64 - 4566.48] P:1629.42 E:0.088865 |  Lallana actually said to Kelly Cates at the break on five live probably Gomez not tight enough to
[4566.48 - 4572.24] P:1567.12 E:0.095473 |  finish us for that it was actually his pass back to Alisson that that was charged down for that
[4572.24 - 4577.04] P:1669.68 E:0.092796 |  goal in the in the first half and now really unfortunate there with that one yeah there's
[4577.04 - 4581.12] P:1932.74 E:0.099870 |  not a lot you can do with a shot but it's the way the Real Madrid and particularly Benzema how
[4581.12 - 4586.48] P:1792.12 E:0.096877 |  they move the ball with pace and it's very very difficult to get near any Real Madrid player
[4586.48 - 4591.76] P:1799.65 E:0.089980 |  when they do that and then he opens himself up for the shot it's not a great shot and you're
[4591.76 - 4597.52] P:1677.16 E:0.085560 |  right there's nothing Alisson or Gomez can do about it it's just really unlucky so there we are
[4597.52 - 4605.68] P:1639.85 E:0.082943 |  Benzema we'll get that I think it was on target the shot from from the ball on door holder so his
[4605.68 - 4611.68] P:1644.21 E:0.096051 |  17th of the season this injury hit season Medellin's had he's actually had five spells out injured
[4611.68 - 4620.24] P:1438.80 E:0.088320 |  and remember was ruled out of the World Cup with France that he's always a danger and he has indeed
[4620.24 - 4630.56] P:1580.42 E:0.101939 |  now joined the scorers tonight so Liverpool from 2-0 up are trailing 4-2 and we've still got over
[4630.64 - 4641.12] P:1587.54 E:0.076703 |  half an hour to play so all is not lost and Liverpool do continue to really cause problems

[5500.32 - 5506.32] P:1760.64 E:0.092814 |  of belief incredible ability particularly that man Modric I mean if there's one guy who you don't
[5506.32 - 5511.68] P:1807.19 E:0.089794 |  want to be up against in world football when you're chasing the game it's that guy the belief that he
[5511.68 - 5518.72] P:1615.29 E:0.091155 |  has on the his ability his little one touches his little give and go and he's vision so another
[5518.72 - 5525.84] P:1605.00 E:0.094214 |  double change Matip is going to come on for Liverpool at the back and James Milner as well
[5525.84 - 5535.12] P:1694.24 E:0.095345 |  as I mentioned so Joe Gomez next way for him and he has just he's been on the rough end of
[5536.08 - 5540.96] P:1819.23 E:0.101307 |  of so much tonight deflections you know certainly he could have been closer to the
[5540.96 - 5546.96] P:1746.46 E:0.096235 |  finishes for the first goal that Real Madrid scored but Matip comes on to replace him and it
[5546.96 - 5553.12] P:1418.04 E:0.097220 |  is Jordan Henderson who makes way for James Milner who will take the captain's arm bound
[5554.72 - 5562.64] P:1509.18 E:0.091552 |  so that is four substitutions that Liverpool have made we've got still almost 20 minutes to play
[5562.64 - 5567.28] P:1632.14 E:0.091617 |  more so wondering you know five goals Liverpool conceding five goals at Anfield
[5568.56 - 5571.36] P:1430.44 E:0.104842 |  I wonder when the last time that happened was
[5573.12 - 5576.56] P:1486.96 E:0.100747 |  ball on the left hand side with Jota you're not looking for an answer are you
[5577.52 - 5582.56] P:1642.82 E:0.077390 |  not sure where to start with that here's Firmino out to the left hand side if you come up with
[5582.56 - 5587.36] P:1544.87 E:0.093243 |  that I would have been very impressed I'm always impressed when you're sitting next to me but I
[5587.36 - 5593.76] P:1641.43 E:0.087221 |  would have been super impressed as Thomas Tucho would say balls out of play for a goal kick to
[5594.64 - 5601.04] P:1505.71 E:0.087675 |  Real Madrid and Jürgen Klopp down there cutting a very isolated figure hands in his pockets
[5602.08 - 5609.60] P:1483.45 E:0.089947 |  black cap pull down Liverpool are looking for a miracle and Modric who coming how many times
[5609.60 - 5616.00] P:1716.48 E:0.086699 |  would be said it of him he is just ageless and Milner playing the ball across comes to the edge
[5616.00 - 5622.96] P:1679.00 E:0.087852 |  of the penalty area where Mili Tau was there to whack it away downfield and then Mathip is able
[5622.96 - 5629.28] P:1644.51 E:0.089254 |  to head it back to Allyson actually Giulietti who's with us he just pointed out remember the 5-5
[5629.28 - 5634.24] P:1689.55 E:0.075074 |  drawing the league cup which actually wasn't that long ago and I was here for that so I should
[5634.24 - 5637.76] P:1569.17 E:0.090744 |  have remembered that should have remembered it's all right you're that stage in your life
[5638.56 - 5639.52] P:1530.09 E:0.055435 |  yeah
[5642.16 - 5646.16] P:1781.99 E:0.106525 |  so when was the last time that score considered five goals in a european tie
[5648.24 - 5655.84] P:1555.19 E:0.084853 |  here's Mathip who's bringing it forward and giving it to Milner on the right hand side Milner away
[5655.84 - 5663.28] P:1593.43 E:0.083139 |  from Carvajal but it feels like it's gone now it does you know whether Liverpool are able to raise
[5663.28 - 5668.48] P:1518.77 E:0.085918 |  themselves as I say there's still 15 minutes left in this game but it now feels that that's not
[5668.48 - 5673.12] P:1551.86 E:0.093760 |  happening that Real Madrid are in control what they're doing really well is is that when Liverpool
[5673.12 - 5677.92] P:1681.14 E:0.093352 |  have the ball they're actually doing going into a 4-5-1 with that guy who would be in Raven tonight
[5677.92 - 5682.16] P:1747.58 E:0.094656 |  about all night and Vinicius Jr on the left he's tucking in that left and making a five-man
[5682.16 - 5685.68] P:1698.38 E:0.094047 |  midfield and doing his work defensively so at the minute there's no way through
[5686.56 - 5690.64] P:1662.38 E:0.097435 |  ball comes to Milner flicks from him but the flicks aren't coming off now straight to Ruediga
[5691.36 - 5698.40] P:1724.71 E:0.088629 |  and now here is Vinicius but Alexander-Arnold comes in and it's deflected out of play and
[5698.96 - 5707.04] P:1673.12 E:0.086367 |  hopefully our friends at ESPN are saying that this is the first time that Liverpool have conceded
[5707.04 - 5713.20] P:1599.71 E:0.090059 |  five goals in a Champions League match you know so we couldn't think the one
[5713.84 - 5718.16] P:1699.30 E:0.091917 |  oh that's sort of come from Kelly Kelly sent us that well thank you Kelly Kelly Kates
[5718.88 - 5723.28] P:1689.11 E:0.085239 |  but this is five live radio Merseyside I'm not sure will there have any listeners left from
[5723.28 - 5730.72] P:1548.71 E:0.085095 |  Radio Merseyside, everything supporters tuned in on that and BBC sounds here's Salah on the right
[5730.72 - 5737.92] P:1717.34 E:0.087795 |  hand side Salah down for Milner Milner right footed cross taken down by Jotart no it just got
[5737.92 - 5743.92] P:1657.28 E:0.075760 |  away from him had his back to goal got his right foot to it and it's cleared away downfield by
[5743.92 - 5752.32] P:1714.78 E:0.085748 |  Real Madrid comes back for Carvajal and Real Madrid with Ruediga playing it out towards the far side
[5753.36 - 5759.36] P:1789.10 E:0.104226 |  and Liverpool win it back brought forward by Robertson Robertson towards the dead ball line
[5759.36 - 5763.28] P:1843.07 E:0.109243 |  but there's cover there Militio comes across and blocks it behind cornered Liverpool low
[5763.84 - 5768.00] P:1791.27 E:0.096852 |  and you can see Clintus' fist there as he blocks that Militio you can see right in front of the
[5768.24 - 5774.72] P:1534.67 E:0.085484 |  in front of the Cop good play from Robertson though need more of that they need more energy
[5775.60 - 5779.84] P:1611.97 E:0.080491 |  corner from the left hand side in front of the Cop the silent Cop
[5781.52 - 5787.12] P:1598.09 E:0.096678 |  Robertson raises his right arm he has to delivery into the near post but can't beat the first man
[5787.12 - 5794.64] P:1548.68 E:0.087633 |  there Carvajal was in position the bearded Carvajal 31 years old gets that away by Chetich with a
[5794.64 - 5800.00] P:1856.29 E:0.096135 |  long diagonal pass looking for Mattip we tried to swing it across on the sprint the substitute
[5800.00 - 5805.04] P:1702.11 E:0.081007 |  the centre of the fender couldn't get it to it it's behind for a goal kick got another
[5805.04 - 5809.52] P:1634.74 E:0.099889 |  got another statistical note coming your way Alan in a moment it's a from our friend
[5810.08 - 5817.12] P:1746.42 E:0.081494 |  Stapman Dave who says this is the first time Liverpool have conceded five goals at Anfield
[5817.12 - 5823.12] P:1614.46 E:0.089816 |  in this competition Champions League European Cup so an historic night
[5825.44 - 5830.16] P:1673.79 E:0.098280 |  in the sense that Liverpool did not want no and they've been too easy to play through particularly
[5830.16 - 5835.68] P:1549.10 E:0.090664 |  this second half I mean it was all looking ever so good when they were two nil open you're thinking
[5835.68 - 5840.64] P:1680.62 E:0.088033 |  yes this could be the turning point for them but then the way Real Madrid have bounced back in the
[5840.64 - 5845.76] P:1755.56 E:0.086274 |  fashion that they have and just Liverpool have played too open yes they've got unbelievable
[5845.76 - 5849.68] P:1834.84 E:0.091599 |  ability in that midfield Real Madrid but if you stick together and you're tight and you make it
[5849.68 - 5855.04] P:1618.86 E:0.091087 |  difficult for the opposition you get men behind the ball and and then it should be harder than it
[5855.04 - 5860.80] P:1675.22 E:0.087250 |  has been for me know getting the ball down on the right hand side but Real Madrid five two up
[5861.76 - 5868.00] P:1701.04 E:0.083345 |  first time that Liverpool have conceded five goals here at Anfield in this competition
[5868.00 - 5873.28] P:1722.86 E:0.092875 |  that they are so fond of Camervinga clearing the ball away I feel like I should return the compliment
[5873.28 - 5880.72] P:1713.97 E:0.085718 |  to Statman Dave by saying listen to the 606 fantasy football podcast with Statman Dave
[5880.72 - 5887.20] P:1771.31 E:0.082111 |  on BBC sounds here's Salah moving in from the right hand side natural the challenge but Salah
[5887.20 - 5893.44] P:1696.62 E:0.081976 |  kept possession Fabinho but we've got ten white shirts parked behind the ball and the dangerous
[5893.44 - 5899.52] P:1499.63 E:0.088712 |  Benzema lurking in the centre circle should Real Madrid break away and and how they broke away for
[5899.52 - 5908.72] P:1591.74 E:0.077131 |  that fifth goal Milner infield towards Alexander Arnold now by Chetich by Chetich curling it out
[5908.72 - 5916.40] P:1574.68 E:0.078623 |  towards the far side Robertson is there Robertson back to the edge of the area Jota by Chetich
[5916.40 - 5923.04] P:1543.76 E:0.084265 |  right footed this is a high one to the right hand side taken down by Alexander Arnold then Salah
[5923.60 - 5927.68] P:1541.13 E:0.098535 |  back again centrally to the middle of the half to buy Chetich then Robertson again on the left hand
[5927.68 - 5936.08] P:1650.32 E:0.085794 |  side but Real Madrid are just sitting in there and and Liverpool are just finding it so hard to
[5936.08 - 5943.60] P:1706.52 E:0.090795 |  to fight try and pick away through them Fabinho now away from Benzema and Valverde to his left to
[5943.60 - 5949.68] P:1693.42 E:0.086317 |  buy Chetich Robertson plays it on beyond Rodrigo but Carvajal was there just to shepherd it behind
[5950.32 - 5955.44] P:1664.09 E:0.095156 |  and then as you do when your five two up turns to Robertson who went to ground and helps him up
[5955.44 - 5965.20] P:1648.79 E:0.082278 |  are you okay everything okay yeah come on yep so another change for Real Madrid and it is
[5965.20 - 5972.24] P:1513.46 E:0.084742 |  Rodrigo who's making way and it's going to be another of the Real Madrid stars Danny Sabayos
[5972.24 - 5978.64] P:1618.19 E:0.091766 |  the former Arsenal low knee who's going to to come on to replace him full time so the 745
[5978.64 - 5983.92] P:1700.48 E:0.103888 |  reaching their full-time whistles so to Millwall Aaron Paul Millwall won Burnley won the point shared
[5983.92 - 5988.00] P:1688.44 E:0.098885 |  in a proper championship battle Ashley Barnes put the visitors ahead with the touch of fortune
[5988.00 - 5993.04] P:1770.98 E:0.101045 |  as the ball dropped him in the box Tom Bradshaw's equaliser had the same level of fortune as he
[5993.04 - 5998.08] P:1744.48 E:0.106083 |  lashed home with five minutes to go Burnley's lead now 12 points at the summit Millwall go into
[5998.08 - 6003.52] P:1716.59 E:0.077579 |  fifth Millwall won Burnley won put the cat among the pitchers wouldn't it if Millwall got promoted
[6003.52 - 6008.72] P:1727.34 E:0.090056 |  to the Premier League at the end of this season having a very good season the other full-time scores
[6008.72 - 6013.60] P:1597.67 E:0.081215 |  they're all coming in Blackburn one of your old clubs Alan have beaten Blackpool in the
[6013.60 - 6021.04] P:1804.58 E:0.085652 |  Northwest Derby 1-0 Millwall won Burnley won as we've just heard from Aaron Norwich City 3-1
[6021.04 - 6027.68] P:1881.75 E:0.083517 |  winners in the end against Birmingham Stokes City have scored again 3-1 up and they've beaten Swansea
[6027.68 - 6033.84] P:1836.98 E:0.077588 |  Swansea 1 Stokes City 3 and they're still playing where Rotherham are 2-1 up on Sunderland in League
[6033.84 - 6040.08] P:1702.53 E:0.086429 |  1 Fleetwood 1 Cambridge United 0 and Morecom 1 Port Vale 0 and not many goals in League 2
[6040.16 - 6046.24] P:1687.93 E:0.083828 |  running through the scores in the moment the four matches that Real Madrid have the ball back Valverde
[6046.24 - 6051.28] P:1779.02 E:0.093017 |  intercepted the pass from by Chetich and it goes back to Courtois so in League 2 Grimsby Town 0
[6051.28 - 6057.68] P:1700.23 E:0.087209 |  Harrogate Town 0 Hartleypool United 0 Newport County 1 bottom of the table Rochdale have
[6057.68 - 6065.84] P:1827.40 E:0.084225 |  lost at home to Stockport 2-1 who are pushing for promotion this season and Walsall 0 crew 0
[6065.84 - 6071.76] P:1588.60 E:0.072869 |  it finished Liverpool with a ball on the right hand side with Alexander Arnold but
[6071.76 - 6077.36] P:1604.77 E:0.082982 |  Naturopoulos able to get a foot in and it bounces away for Real Madrid and Benzemaan now
[6077.36 - 6081.60] P:1684.34 E:0.103402 |  half wins side his own half plays at round one side of Salah Cronk out there it's out of play
[6081.60 - 6087.20] P:1759.93 E:0.095025 |  throwing the Liverpool Hamilton 2 in Vanessa 1 in the championship in Scotland Albion Rovers 3
[6087.20 - 6096.32] P:1639.67 E:0.079886 |  Elgin City 0 and still playing Eintracht Frankfurt 0 Napoli 2 the latest in the other match in the
[6096.32 - 6103.36] P:1578.65 E:0.085033 |  first legs tonight Plymouth 1 Cheltenham 1 is the latest score in the in the EFL trophy semi-final
[6104.16 - 6108.24] P:1734.20 E:0.092382 |  so we've got less than 10 minutes to play about eight minutes actually plus added time
[6109.52 - 6113.84] P:1659.62 E:0.084747 |  and it's the Real Madrid supporters you can hear in the rest of Anfield whether it's the Cop
[6114.40 - 6118.96] P:1709.24 E:0.095131 |  or the Kenny Dalglish stand or the main stand here there's a little bit of a pause down there
[6118.96 - 6123.36] P:1544.95 E:0.082874 |  for James Milner blocking the ball out for a throw or the other Liverpool supporters in the
[6123.36 - 6130.88] P:1704.55 E:0.086406 |  Anfield roll and after it was so loud so vibrant in the early stages when Liverpool were on top
[6130.88 - 6139.36] P:1700.29 E:0.071632 |  and scoring their two goals it is Shrove Tuesday today and I'm afraid it has gone as flat as the
[6139.36 - 6150.80] P:1593.62 E:0.083140 |  proverbial here's Militao passing it out to Modric and then Rudiger, Nacho and Modric with his
[6150.80 - 6156.32] P:1558.70 E:0.086101 |  right foot but that's cut out by the the right leg of Alexander-Arnold by Chetitzen plays it over
[6156.32 - 6162.32] P:1661.81 E:0.091102 |  the top easy for Rudiger just to head it down above Firmino now Nacho sets off down the left hand side
[6162.32 - 6166.96] P:1672.82 E:0.098694 |  Nacho taking the ball a long long way all shoved over by Alexander-Arnold
[6167.60 - 6171.44] P:1741.82 E:0.101906 |  No says the referee I thought I saw his hands go to the back of Nacho who can't believe he hasn't
[6171.44 - 6175.76] P:1726.26 E:0.092995 |  got a free kick but Liverpool have got it so did I I thought Trent got got away with one there
[6175.76 - 6181.28] P:1663.55 E:0.078298 |  because he Nacho's away from him and he's chasing him and he does push him from behind and the
[6181.28 - 6186.00] P:1664.20 E:0.088704 |  referee I think's got a good view there but he chooses not to give the free kick luckily for Liverpool
[6187.20 - 6192.08] P:1356.76 E:0.084747 |  time running out tonight seven minutes to go I think there's going to be another Liverpool
[6192.08 - 6197.68] P:1586.72 E:0.082216 |  change shortly I don't know how many times you were in this kind of position Alan but I mean
[6197.68 - 6202.72] P:1785.10 E:0.092536 |  it's just a case of what kind of score the ball comes across Salah was almost in but Nacho comes
[6202.72 - 6207.12] P:1685.48 E:0.093007 |  across did well actually Firmino trying to find a way through but it bounces away Militao defended
[6207.12 - 6212.40] P:1634.66 E:0.083261 |  it well and Militao passes it forward and then Valverde he's got it on the right hand side it's
[6212.40 - 6218.64] P:1700.28 E:0.091794 |  horrible it really is horrible because you are chasing shadows when you're up against ability
[6218.64 - 6223.76] P:1626.15 E:0.101020 |  like Modric and Benzeman, Vinicius Jr and Camarvinger guys who are so comfortable on the ball
[6223.76 - 6226.88] P:1820.51 E:0.104308 |  it's hard enough when it's nil nil let alone when you're losing by three goals
[6228.96 - 6234.88] P:1526.17 E:0.094310 |  and a two leg tie though Fabinho carrying the ball forward towards the edge of the box but it's
[6234.88 - 6242.48] P:1620.17 E:0.081956 |  all rather ponderous this Firmino threw into the box and then Jota getting the crossover
[6243.04 - 6248.72] P:1803.84 E:0.097589 |  comes off Carverhouse as the referee it's a corner to Liverpool and Rotherham have won
[6248.72 - 6255.20] P:1794.28 E:0.081219 |  Rotherham have beaten Sunderland by two goals to one not one in five so that's their first
[6255.20 - 6260.88] P:1711.56 E:0.081083 |  win in six matches and clearly a blow for Sunderland at the other end of the table
[6261.76 - 6268.64] P:1810.44 E:0.094132 |  corner for Liverpool Harvey Elliott coming on though first of all for by Cepic in the midfield
[6269.52 - 6275.76] P:1867.18 E:0.115244 |  and it's been a tough school today for by Cheddington the midfield against this lot
[6277.04 - 6282.16] P:1851.83 E:0.100799 |  no he looked back and he certainly learned from this how it could and perhaps should be done
[6283.04 - 6287.12] P:1869.06 E:0.096999 |  but he tried hard and worked hard he never gave up but he's up against some of the very very best
[6287.12 - 6290.88] P:1683.58 E:0.087418 |  in there tonight it was always going to be difficult for him Alexander-Arnold with the corner for
[6290.88 - 6297.92] P:1676.65 E:0.080749 |  Liverpool that's easily headed away stooping forward Carverhouse was able to unchallenged
[6297.92 - 6302.56] P:1632.09 E:0.084463 |  headed away to the halfway line so if you've just switched on to us on five live already on
[6302.56 - 6311.12] P:1514.87 E:0.082482 |  Merseyside listening on BBC sounds it was 2-0 to Liverpool Darwin Nunez and Salah and the place was
[6311.12 - 6318.48] P:1626.52 E:0.083058 |  absolutely rocking at that stage Valverde playing the ball forward and Vinicius Jr who did the
[6318.48 - 6324.56] P:1820.06 E:0.088401 |  damage in the first half scoring two goals to draw it level first a brilliant finish the second
[6324.64 - 6330.48] P:1786.42 E:0.084984 |  charging down in allison clearance so 2-2 at halftime but Carlo Ancelotti's team have just
[6330.48 - 6336.32] P:1662.75 E:0.084684 |  taken it away from Liverpool in the in the second half and now he's going to make another couple
[6336.32 - 6340.56] P:1670.34 E:0.089016 |  of changes and Tony Cross he wasn't even in the country this morning is going to come on

[6348.72 - 6352.88] P:1834.14 E:0.094244 |  has applauded off by actually many of the Liverpool fans as well inside the ground
[6353.76 - 6358.80] P:1658.57 E:0.099832 |  Marco Asensio great champions league pedigree that he's got as well
[6360.96 - 6366.72] P:1695.36 E:0.090873 |  and uh and also I thought that might happen Benzema off and Modric as well
[6366.72 - 6371.52] P:1591.25 E:0.079655 |  Atletico Madrid to play at the weekend Barcelona to play next week not bad soaps to Cumbama

[6381.28 - 6384.64] P:1708.15 E:0.092720 |  37 years old he's still talking about playing on for Croatian isn't he
[6384.64 - 6388.72] P:1730.30 E:0.090935 |  well looking at him tonight the way he's done overlaps the way he's protected the back four
[6388.72 - 6393.84] P:1683.39 E:0.090997 |  the way his ability on the ball to control the midfield as he has done I'm not surprised
[6393.84 - 6402.00] P:1531.60 E:0.083129 |  this is his 468th appearance for Real Madrid I remember and he had four years at Tottenham before
[6402.00 - 6409.44] P:1471.05 E:0.086900 |  that what a player what an athlete and uh and what what really struck you possibly actually what I'll
[6409.44 - 6416.56] P:1662.59 E:0.090641 |  remember about this is the way that he went away from Paj Cetic the teenager just a surging run to
[6416.56 - 6422.40] P:1642.73 E:0.078857 |  set up I think that was the fifth goal wasn't it for Real Madrid the 37 year old running away from

[6479.60 - 6483.28] P:1698.34 E:0.105317 |  cross I thought cross might have been fell there Liverpool bring it forward Salah he has
[6483.28 - 6488.24] P:1668.34 E:0.088629 |  Elliot Elliot into the game but crosses it into Rudiger and it bounces out of play for a throwing
[6488.80 - 6496.88] P:1588.54 E:0.075965 |  to Liverpool near the corner flag Alexander Arnold takes it down and in it goes now into the edge
[6496.88 - 6501.36] P:1607.50 E:0.088248 |  of the penalty area to Flameno who couldn't control it Real Madrid clear it hit the referee
[6501.36 - 6507.84] P:1564.13 E:0.075673 |  actually but the referee's left play to continue with Nacho and Nacho into the centre circle to
[6507.84 - 6513.84] P:1591.03 E:0.069365 |  Valverde Liverpool quickly back in position certainly don't want a sixth goal on this night
[6513.84 - 6520.32] P:1655.67 E:0.087711 |  of unwanted history for Liverpool conceding five goals in the Champions League here at Antioch
[6521.60 - 6526.40] P:1570.14 E:0.091762 |  he's doing well in there as well in the midfield Camo Vinga mind you they all have they've all
[6526.40 - 6533.52] P:1429.74 E:0.077860 |  been outstanding so Marco Asensio over there on the right hand side it comes back centrally
[6534.40 - 6542.16] P:1467.00 E:0.086507 |  and played forward by Ceballos coming on into the midfield remember those two years that he had
[6542.16 - 6551.84] P:1662.02 E:0.093248 |  at Arsenal and now Nacho at the back we're in the 90th minute now Real Madrid in possession the cop
[6551.84 - 6555.76] P:1668.44 E:0.096824 |  won a little bit more than this from their Liverpool team instead it's Real Madrid who
[6555.76 - 6560.72] P:1780.24 E:0.090259 |  continue to come forward Nacho surging forward whenever he gets the chance and they really
[6560.72 - 6565.76] P:1716.34 E:0.090351 |  are thinking of absolutely making sure of this Real Madrid if they can Carvajal on the right
[6565.76 - 6572.72] P:1465.68 E:0.077361 |  hand side comes back to Ceballos Valverde is there now Camo Vinga and Camo Vinga as well you know
[6572.72 - 6578.64] P:1570.35 E:0.094106 |  what a beautifully economical player he is superb he's linked up really well the understanding
[6578.64 - 6583.20] P:1593.10 E:0.092072 |  that him and Modric have had in the midfield tonight yeah it's worked perfectly for them yeah
[6583.20 - 6588.08] P:1564.85 E:0.103630 |  and you can see can't you that he learned from Casamiro when he was it's like watching Casamiro
[6588.08 - 6593.84] P:1533.56 E:0.105785 |  isn't it a younger version Casamiro who will be involved against Barcelona all being well on

[6630.32 - 6635.84] P:1540.15 E:0.093153 |  you will be able to hear all of that and indeed this live from Anfield here's Firmino through the
[6635.84 - 6643.52] P:1488.97 E:0.085849 |  middle jot out bounces off him and Militao is able to get a touch in on it Real Madrid come forward
[6643.52 - 6650.32] P:1601.02 E:0.077509 |  again some have left now there are empty seats appearing can't see too many empty seats on the
[6650.32 - 6656.88] P:1597.69 E:0.085567 |  cop but what a sobering night it's been the right Liverpool with the ball in the middle into the
[6656.88 - 6662.48] P:1774.58 E:0.103354 |  penalty area Salas after that was challenged by Nacho went down the referee's having none of that
[6663.04 - 6668.72] P:1628.65 E:0.080179 |  and he's helped up by by the same player natural pulls him up onto his feet no complaints from
[6668.72 - 6674.72] P:1644.70 E:0.076858 |  Liverpool throwing on the left hand side it's finished Eintracht Frankfurt nil Napoli two
[6674.72 - 6681.04] P:1535.34 E:0.086638 |  in the first leg in the other tie tonight I know many Alan are fencing maybe Napoli could be the
[6681.04 - 6685.68] P:1505.84 E:0.096670 |  Champions League winners this season I know they've got their sights set on winning the league in
[6685.68 - 6690.16] P:1464.41 E:0.095721 |  Italy having not done it for such a long time he has Jotter on the edge of the penalty area bounces
[6690.16 - 6696.56] P:1538.62 E:0.094079 |  back to Salah on the edge of the box but advances to cross and Real Madrid clear it away and Matip
[6696.56 - 6703.12] P:1403.94 E:0.094822 |  will knock it in field to Van Dyke and they are staying so they can sing you'll never walk along
[6703.12 - 6708.32] P:1624.04 E:0.090537 |  and that's what it's all about really to do that on occasions such as this yeah it's been a tough
[6708.32 - 6713.68] P:1451.29 E:0.095803 |  night for them really has been a tough night for them despite the start that they had no one ever
[6713.68 - 6717.76] P:1692.51 E:0.094914 |  saw this come and did they the way that Real Madrid have actually just demolished Liverpool
[6717.76 - 6722.08] P:1695.95 E:0.097724 |  particularly in the midfield areas where they've just passed it around for fun and Liverpool have
[6722.08 - 6727.92] P:1660.33 E:0.107355 |  not been able to get near them a free kick for a foul on that show the yellow card as well I think
[6729.20 - 6733.76] P:1746.05 E:0.087008 |  for Elliott for that challenge so yellow card for Harvey Elliott but it's it's it's rather
[6733.76 - 6739.28] P:1714.28 E:0.086531 |  sobering isn't it this week and last week for the the mighty Premier League in the in the Champions
[6739.28 - 6745.28] P:1599.23 E:0.087410 |  League Chelsea and Tottenham losing 1-0 away not able to score a goal between them and now Liverpool
[6745.28 - 6751.04] P:1684.06 E:0.083717 |  5-2 down at home against Real Madrid yeah it is absolutely yeah but this team's a special team
[6751.04 - 6755.20] P:1618.96 E:0.106815 |  with some very very good players with a wily old manager who's been there and done it everywhere
[6755.20 - 6761.28] P:1585.55 E:0.086905 |  he's been and know how to go to places like Anfield and get a result and hence as I was about to say
[6761.28 - 6766.08] P:1653.34 E:0.099443 |  people think about maybe Napoli in the Champions League but who would bet against Real Madrid
[6766.08 - 6773.92] P:1792.28 E:0.092091 |  and certainly after what they've done here to Liverpool and the recent revival has been stopped
[6773.92 - 6782.08] P:1655.06 E:0.093531 |  juttering in its tracks by the Champions League holders the club world cup winners who've come
[6782.08 - 6789.52] P:1531.09 E:0.097597 |  here and inflicted a record equaling defeat in terms of margin on Liverpool in Europe at Anfield
[6789.52 - 6797.20] P:1483.58 E:0.093213 |  and also the first time Liverpool have conceded five goals in this competition here at Anfield
[6797.20 - 6802.72] P:1636.68 E:0.101412 |  5-2 Alan Shearer well you've seen a masterclass and how not to panic how to have belief in your
[6802.72 - 6808.08] P:1687.82 E:0.091618 |  ability keep going the way you wanted to where to play and stick to the tactics that the manager's
[6808.08 - 6813.04] P:1767.03 E:0.094470 |  given you and eventually something to turn but it helps when you've got the brilliance of Venetius
[6813.04 - 6818.64] P:1566.09 E:0.096487 |  Jr up front when you've got the know-how of Benzema who's been there and done it before when you've
[6818.64 - 6824.80] P:1771.91 E:0.099227 |  got the brilliance of Moderich in midfield with the energy and the youth of Camarvinga in and around
[6824.80 - 6830.80] P:1809.07 E:0.095716 |  him so this is an experienced team with an experienced manager who've done it before at the highest level
[6830.80 - 6838.08] P:1717.73 E:0.094956 |  and they have punished Liverpool tonight in a heavy way so there we are Liverpool 2-0 up inside the
[6838.08 - 6846.40] P:1677.54 E:0.107530 |  first 15 minutes through Nunes and Salah but then Liverpool five conceded five goals without
[6846.40 - 6854.80] P:1691.45 E:0.100863 |  reply five goals without reply 2-2 at halftime 2 for Venetius Jr then Milletow as the Real Madrid
[6854.80 - 6861.44] P:1585.05 E:0.097114 |  players go to their supporters and then two for the great Karim Benzema as well we didn't know
[6861.44 - 6869.20] P:1607.76 E:0.093786 |  quite what to expect tonight we found it hard to predict it didn't it but I don't think anyone
[6869.20 - 6876.00] P:1702.68 E:0.094560 |  expected this kind of Spanish Inquisition Liverpool 2 Real Madrid five
[6878.64 - 6884.40] P:1622.86 E:0.111926 |  John Murray and Alan Shearer at Anfield for that Champions League round of 16 first leg Alan as
[6884.40 - 6889.28] P:1671.04 E:0.094586 |  you've just been reflecting on with John and we'll come to the the Liverpool Deficiency season
[6889.28 - 6896.00] P:1651.63 E:0.097797 |  in a moment but this is just a Real Madrid side who yes their form has been up and down this season
[6896.00 - 6901.68] P:1704.68 E:0.094571 |  but their affinity with this tournament their skills and their talent that they have in this side
[6901.68 - 6907.84] P:1710.97 E:0.090953 |  just shone through particularly from about halfway through the first half yeah they didn't panic when
[6907.84 - 6914.16] P:1700.34 E:0.094362 |  they went 2-0 down nothing changed they stuck to their game plan and then as I said when you've
[6914.16 - 6920.64] P:1844.83 E:0.094910 |  got the ability of him in midfield moderate so the way he controls it his his belief in
[6920.64 - 6924.96] P:1928.37 E:0.100000 |  who and what's around him he's little one touch and he's gives and he goes and and then you've
[6924.96 - 6931.28] P:1902.49 E:0.089087 |  got the energy of Camarvinga in and around him but the brilliance of those two up front in Venetius
[6931.28 - 6935.84] P:1914.04 E:0.098148 |  Jr and Benzema you give them an opportunity you were going to get punished and that's exactly
[6935.84 - 6941.68] P:1942.33 E:0.089397 |  what Liverpool did I mean the first one yes that Gomez could have got closer to to Vinicius he might
[6941.68 - 6947.12] P:1851.65 E:0.085997 |  have blocked the shot if he did but the way he picks his spot and knocks it past the the goalkeeper
[6947.12 - 6951.20] P:1894.83 E:0.093002 |  and Allison's got no chance and then we're thinking what's going to happen in the second half when
[6951.20 - 6956.88] P:1892.53 E:0.087855 |  it's 2-2 and you think okay it's not a bad result for Liverpool to go over there and but but then you
[6956.88 - 6962.40] P:2000.38 E:0.091166 |  see in the brilliance and the way moderate just goes past by Chechich in the midfield as if to say
[6962.40 - 6967.76] P:1875.91 E:0.095950 |  get off me you're not going to stay with me and then for him to find the to find Venetius Jr on
[6967.76 - 6972.32] P:1892.78 E:0.094753 |  the left and the way he put it into Benzema and then what you're talking about you're talking about
[6972.32 - 6976.72] P:1928.57 E:0.093032 |  killers up front who if you give them an opportunity they're going to take it and Liverpool give them
[6976.72 - 6983.12] P:1885.58 E:0.087528 |  too many tonight and it's a harsh lesson it's been a harsh lesson for Liverpool with that 5-2
[6983.12 - 6986.64] P:1751.21 E:0.059623 |  defeat at Anfield we'll be reflecting much more on that
