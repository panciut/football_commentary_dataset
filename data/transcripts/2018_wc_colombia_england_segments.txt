[0.00 - 10.16] P:1916.35 E:0.312468 |  Well, thanks Mark, the England team and the Columbia team are now marching together out
[10.16 - 12.36] P:1816.05 E:0.259257 |  of the tunnel.
[12.36 - 19.68] P:1874.00 E:0.273093 |  The knockout stage of this World Cup is about to arrive for England and for Columbia.
[19.68 - 24.48] P:1793.30 E:0.305094 |  And they've arrived in Moscow, the England team on what is a cloudy evening.
[24.48 - 27.12] P:1807.39 E:0.288638 |  It might rain, it's quite cool as well.
[27.12 - 31.08] P:1846.30 E:0.280932 |  I would think that that would be good for the England team at this terrific stadium,
[31.08 - 37.52] P:1821.87 E:0.281510 |  the home of Spartak Moscow, which has the huge statue of Spartakus, the gladiator, standing
[37.52 - 45.92] P:1806.44 E:0.286034 |  on its pyramid plinth outside and the stadium with a red and white Spartak Moscow shell
[45.92 - 55.96] P:1660.65 E:0.265240 |  around it, inside 44,000 people and they are on their feet now as we wait for the anthems.
[55.96 - 66.72] P:1878.45 E:0.351104 |  But first of all, it will be the stirring anthem of Columbia.
[66.72 - 72.12] P:1756.96 E:0.345107 |  So Harry Kane turns to his right and leads his England team along the line and clasps
[72.12 - 75.68] P:1663.26 E:0.352941 |  hands with those 11 Colombians in the yellow shirts.
[75.68 - 80.32] P:1789.63 E:0.312499 |  England against Columbia, a country that has never recorded a victory over England in five
[80.32 - 82.00] P:1892.95 E:0.258775 |  previous meetings.
[82.00 - 86.88] P:1800.30 E:0.308005 |  The might, if you're old enough, remember the game at France 98, their only previous
[86.88 - 90.32] P:1744.19 E:0.325935 |  meeting at a World Cup finals tournament when England won by two goals to nil.
[90.32 - 93.68] P:1798.48 E:0.297966 |  Gareth Southgate was among the unused substitutes that day.
[93.68 - 96.00] P:1786.06 E:0.312077 |  But that's all history, Chris Waddle.
[96.00 - 100.60] P:1742.10 E:0.306966 |  What Columbia are here in Russia is one of the group winners and the group winners are
[100.60 - 102.00] P:1770.54 E:0.324264 |  tending the goal through.
[102.00 - 106.32] P:1710.64 E:0.311781 |  So far six of the seven group winners are into the last date, the exceptions being Russia,
[106.32 - 109.24] P:1716.66 E:0.307424 |  who was renault because we sat and watched it.
[109.24 - 110.24] P:1660.68 E:0.306032 |  They shouldn't have got through.
[110.60 - 115.52] P:1745.42 E:0.333262 |  So yeah, there's a partner there, isn't there, where all the group leaders are going through.
[115.52 - 118.24] P:1849.96 E:0.314440 |  But you've got to say England should be very confident coming out.
[118.24 - 121.92] P:1878.61 E:0.328549 |  I know the rest of the players against Belgium and obviously lost one nil.
[121.92 - 126.08] P:1851.34 E:0.311134 |  But listen, we don't know which club in say is going to turn up.
[126.08 - 129.48] P:1844.49 E:0.294356 |  So I don't think England's got really anything to fear here.
[129.48 - 133.96] P:1776.52 E:0.300317 |  The two number nine are shaking hands, the two captains, Harry Kane and Radamel Falcao,
[133.96 - 139.68] P:1727.83 E:0.291702 |  who we know very well, now posing with the American officials, referee Mark Geiger.
[140.44 - 144.76] P:1799.51 E:0.326558 |  Chris Waddle sitting alongside me here, Chris, who won 62 caps for England in the commentary
[144.76 - 148.56] P:1775.09 E:0.317414 |  position, which is very low down actually in the Spartak Stadium, but will also be able
[148.56 - 153.00] P:1830.35 E:0.302905 |  to bring in Terry Butcher, the captain last time England reached the World Cup semi-final,
[153.00 - 158.52] P:1831.30 E:0.293563 |  who's standing behind the advertising hoardings at one end at pitch level.
[158.52 - 162.16] P:1832.07 E:0.299141 |  So Terry, just give us a thought from you before this game begins.
[162.16 - 166.00] P:1768.67 E:0.308121 |  Well, I'm actually sitting down, I've got a stool here, it feels like I'm fishing in
[166.00 - 167.00] P:1685.02 E:0.318766 |  the canals.
[167.00 - 171.20] P:1790.41 E:0.316666 |  But I'm just peering over the top of the advertising boards of pitch is magnificent, really looking
[171.20 - 172.60] P:1833.58 E:0.339068 |  forward to a great atmosphere.
[172.60 - 176.92] P:1856.77 E:0.321685 |  England want to try and silence this crowd because obviously the majority are Colombian
[176.92 - 180.60] P:1880.39 E:0.336762 |  supporters, but England look sharp, bright red kit, look fantastic.
[180.60 - 184.12] P:1972.37 E:0.338777 |  Here we go, looking forward to it.
[184.12 - 188.72] P:1748.84 E:0.336152 |  So Terry Butcher and Chris Waddle, Reathers inside the stadium on five live, Colombia
[188.72 - 193.84] P:1804.73 E:0.296236 |  against England in the last 16 at this 2018 World Cup.
[193.96 - 202.08] P:1842.43 E:0.310795 |  Colombia with a Spina in goal, the Arsenal goalkeeper back for of Arias, Yerimina of
[202.08 - 208.40] P:1763.49 E:0.301381 |  Barcelona, Gavinson Sanchez of Tottenham, Johan Mojica is the left back, three central midfielders,
[208.40 - 212.32] P:1742.33 E:0.294613 |  Carlos Sanchez, the former Aston Dillaman who was sent off in the first match, Jefferson
[212.32 - 218.84] P:1718.97 E:0.288558 |  Lerma and Wilmar Barrios, and then one quadrado, one Quintero and Radomal Falcao up front.
[218.84 - 222.92] P:1800.49 E:0.306696 |  And England, same team that played against Tunisia at the start of this World Cup.
[222.96 - 228.40] P:1812.76 E:0.272726 |  Jordan Pickford in goal, Walker Stones in Maguire, Trippier and Young, Henderson, Lingard,
[228.40 - 232.68] P:1866.83 E:0.257894 |  Dali Alley, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane.
[232.68 - 234.48] P:1794.78 E:0.274562 |  The atmosphere, wonderful.
[234.48 - 237.48] P:1849.82 E:0.287362 |  It's a Colombian atmosphere, it must be said.
[237.48 - 242.32] P:1754.74 E:0.300266 |  Flags of yellow, blue and red waving all around the stadium.
[242.32 - 250.00] P:1795.54 E:0.293781 |  The England flags, the Cross of St George flags are all, well mainly in the end, to our right.
[250.08 - 254.72] P:1848.64 E:0.312276 |  And in the first half we'll play from right to left in the all red kit tonight with the
[254.72 - 255.72] P:2020.75 E:0.343706 |  white trim.
[255.72 - 260.32] P:1924.98 E:0.329724 |  But it's Colombia in the yellow shirts, the white shorts and the white socks who get
[260.32 - 268.20] P:1840.09 E:0.255374 |  the game underway in the last 16 at this World Cup tournament, this wide open half of the
[268.20 - 269.20] P:1728.17 E:0.264607 |  draw.
[269.20 - 273.28] P:1790.67 E:0.290610 |  And immediately Arias pushing up the right hand side, which is very much his way, the
[273.28 - 277.88] P:1901.25 E:0.285170 |  right back, England get their first touch as Jellie Alley and then Harry Kane deflected
[277.96 - 280.32] P:1796.57 E:0.323006 |  out of play for a throwing to Colombia, any other halfway line.
[280.32 - 284.76] P:1823.06 E:0.288942 |  But the number four Arias will take back into central defence where he finds Big
[284.76 - 291.04] P:1748.72 E:0.301533 |  Yeri Mina, who moved to Barcelona in January and has yet to settle there but has been
[291.04 - 295.36] P:1694.13 E:0.329135 |  quite a presence in this Colombian side so far and has obviously scored two goals from
[295.36 - 296.36] P:1856.54 E:0.266747 |  set pieces.
[296.36 - 301.44] P:1698.49 E:0.305951 |  To his left the Tottenham man, Davinson Sanchez, who receives the ball now in his white boots
[301.44 - 307.84] P:1715.29 E:0.301329 |  and then plays it out to the left hand side to Johan Mojica, who plays for Girona in Spain.
[307.84 - 309.20] P:1647.91 E:0.283690 |  That's their back four.
[309.20 - 312.12] P:1816.81 E:0.282756 |  Long ball hit up towards Falcao who comes short for it.
[312.12 - 316.28] P:1921.80 E:0.316286 |  The ball whizzes over his head and Jordan Pickford gets his first touch of the match.
[316.28 - 321.32] P:1911.74 E:0.338948 |  So Colombia nil, England nil, good to have you with us on Five Live, BBC Five Live following
[321.32 - 323.40] P:1961.26 E:0.330035 |  England at this World Cup 2018.
[323.40 - 326.40] P:1986.00 E:0.301726 |  You can listen via the BBC Sport app as well.
[326.40 - 330.96] P:1959.49 E:0.324492 |  The BBC World Service across Africa are listening in as well, good to have you with us as well
[330.96 - 333.00] P:1932.81 E:0.301284 |  as TSN in Canada too.
[333.00 - 335.24] P:1864.14 E:0.332287 |  So hello to you all wherever you are.
[335.24 - 339.48] P:1971.57 E:0.300427 |  He has young, playing the ball back for England into his own half and then Maguire going all
[339.48 - 341.08] P:1991.06 E:0.308018 |  the way back to Jordan Pickford.
[341.08 - 343.64] P:1915.96 E:0.333910 |  Coruza booze and whistles from the Colombian fans.
[343.64 - 347.84] P:2016.74 E:0.300296 |  I just strange I have set up with Falcao, Pordrudo on the right, what we thought, but you've
[347.84 - 350.72] P:2035.89 E:0.335343 |  got, you've got, Quintero was actually playing as a 10, yeah, Falcao.
[350.72 - 356.52] P:2052.63 E:0.316638 |  So he left back to being isolated and, hey, Q and Chip, they should get them, especially
[356.52 - 358.52] P:1846.96 E:0.337240 |  Co-Water should be getting a lot of the balls.
[358.52 - 359.80] P:1948.47 E:0.298491 |  Nobody on that side.
[359.80 - 364.76] P:1908.41 E:0.286411 |  Raheem Sterling, 999 days since he last scored for England.
[365.28 - 369.24] P:1773.86 E:0.289893 |  He's the first to run forward, then receives it again, but a strong challenge from Mojica
[369.24 - 373.92] P:1703.42 E:0.271459 |  comes in on him and Colombia are back in possession inside their own half.
[373.92 - 378.32] P:1781.26 E:0.313420 |  And in fact, Quintero does well, little Quintero holds it up against Henderson, then plays
[378.32 - 380.60] P:1717.61 E:0.290574 |  at Darius on the right-hand side here.
[380.60 - 384.32] P:1656.18 E:0.287245 |  Cuadrado, Juventus makes a run out to the right-hand side, but it comes in field to
[384.32 - 387.12] P:1640.69 E:0.279191 |  Quintero who of course is having a very good World Cup.
[387.12 - 393.20] P:1769.34 E:0.280718 |  This, this Porto man who has had, as Tim Vickery was suggesting, as the cross comes in from
[393.32 - 396.64] P:1590.71 E:0.287480 |  Mojica on the left-hand side, but is easily headed away for England.
[396.64 - 397.80] P:1636.38 E:0.309238 |  And England take possession.
[397.80 - 401.32] P:1892.23 E:0.300524 |  Kyle Walker, very cool from Walker to beat Quintero.
[401.32 - 404.12] P:1967.80 E:0.316101 |  And England are looking to pass it out from the back.
[404.12 - 411.92] P:1994.21 E:0.328532 |  Yeah, Quintero, whose parent club is Porto, but as Tim Vickery was suggesting, has had
[411.92 - 416.40] P:1916.48 E:0.331351 |  various lifestyle issues and has ended up in Argentina on loan at Boca Juniors, but
[416.40 - 419.52] P:1797.79 E:0.310287 |  has done well there and therefore has got his international recall.
[419.52 - 421.92] P:1801.46 E:0.298564 |  He has Harry Kane winning a free kick, I'm taking it quickly.
[422.12 - 424.56] P:1899.83 E:0.294941 |  Out to the right-hand side, Trippia arrives.
[424.56 - 427.76] P:1862.97 E:0.310914 |  Trippia with a little ball down the right towards Lingard.
[427.76 - 432.32] P:1676.19 E:0.303566 |  But Davinson Sanchez allows it to run, but it won't run out of play, so he has to take
[432.32 - 434.52] P:1794.95 E:0.304038 |  the ball and clear it away.
[434.52 - 439.28] P:1763.71 E:0.311671 |  And he, as he was doing so, he was fell by Lingard and it's a free kick to Columbia
[439.28 - 440.36] P:1801.62 E:0.314599 |  in the left-back position.
[440.36 - 442.72] P:1741.49 E:0.310956 |  So Nil Nil, very early stage, is three minutes played.
[442.72 - 448.16] P:1715.31 E:0.287688 |  Actually, Barrios has dropped sort of right in front of 2.5, so they've really packed them
[448.16 - 449.16] P:1976.60 E:0.234349 |  in midfield.
[449.16 - 457.04] P:1832.77 E:0.294895 |  And the two full-backs are actually playing like wing-backs and sort of 2.5 and Barrios
[457.04 - 460.68] P:1787.68 E:0.313319 |  just keeps dropping in to make it three, but he's sort of playing ten yards in front of
[460.68 - 461.68] P:1990.65 E:0.222950 |  the midtimes.
[461.68 - 469.16] P:1770.49 E:0.312166 |  Barrios, who plays with Boca Juniors in Argentina, can clear a river plate, that's where he's
[469.16 - 473.52] P:1780.72 E:0.278797 |  been on loan, free kick to be taken by Ospina.
[473.52 - 480.56] P:1801.91 E:0.275392 |  They are Snow Goalkeeper, who has committed the odd mistake and error during the course
[480.56 - 487.04] P:1808.64 E:0.272721 |  of this qualifying campaign, and indeed in some of the warm-up matches as well, where
[487.04 - 490.40] P:1918.00 E:0.309255 |  he looked rather shaky in the match against France, but it's worth pointing out that this
[490.40 - 495.12] P:1984.52 E:0.268297 |  Columbia team did beat France 3-2 in March.
[495.12 - 496.44] P:2004.87 E:0.260940 |  England with possession.
[496.44 - 499.16] P:1950.22 E:0.268310 |  Henderson goes all the way back to Pitt for the game.
[499.28 - 503.72] P:1996.93 E:0.256515 |  And this is a composed start from England.
[503.72 - 509.32] P:1979.79 E:0.267968 |  Not the quick start yet that Garry Southgate wanted to see.
[509.32 - 511.68] P:1910.38 E:0.283298 |  Pitt out to McGuire, McGuire then.
[511.68 - 517.72] P:1854.91 E:0.297942 |  Kane has come very deep and actually Barrios went all the way with Harry Kane, deep into
[517.72 - 518.72] P:1840.40 E:0.292227 |  his own territory.
[518.72 - 521.36] P:1830.58 E:0.307272 |  Deli Ali now on the left-hand side, just in front of us.
[521.36 - 526.60] P:1773.12 E:0.315087 |  Sterling with a run down the left-hand side and the defender, Nina, slides in in the full-back
[526.60 - 529.12] P:1744.61 E:0.275064 |  position and takes it with his arm.
[529.12 - 532.80] P:1647.40 E:0.282765 |  It goes behind for what would have been a corner, but in fact it was handball, so it's a free
[532.80 - 533.80] P:1718.07 E:0.272765 |  kick, Chris.
[533.80 - 537.04] P:1759.83 E:0.320943 |  Well, so far England has been very, very good at set pieces and this is a great position,
[537.04 - 538.04] P:1776.72 E:0.333112 |  isn't it?
[538.04 - 542.04] P:1909.65 E:0.301587 |  Well, it's five yards off the bi-lane, just outside the 18-yard box on this left-hand side.
[542.04 - 545.04] P:2003.95 E:0.291111 |  And we've got a lot of options here.
[545.04 - 548.48] P:2009.22 E:0.288432 |  Will he shoot at the cross the goal?
[548.48 - 551.64] P:1961.22 E:0.298425 |  Ashley Young is the only contender to take it.
[551.64 - 553.80] P:1860.39 E:0.322463 |  Trippias are in right away over to the far side.
[553.80 - 558.84] P:1912.84 E:0.308651 |  Walker and Lingard are outside the box, but the big presence of Harry McGuire has been
[558.84 - 560.96] P:1935.97 E:0.328225 |  the obvious target for England set pieces.
[560.96 - 564.24] P:2003.10 E:0.332799 |  Will they work one in the training here where somebody spins around the back or gets across
[564.24 - 568.48] P:2028.50 E:0.274606 |  the near post and they only need a flick of the paces on the cross.
[568.48 - 573.56] P:1957.03 E:0.288645 |  It's Nail Nail, five-live, free kick, first big chance at this round of 16 match.
[573.56 - 575.04] P:1972.31 E:0.287344 |  Young's still waiting.
[575.04 - 576.76] P:1904.33 E:0.305472 |  There's lots of movement in the box.
[576.76 - 579.20] P:1917.63 E:0.287674 |  Referee Geiger just keeping an eye on it.
[579.20 - 583.84] P:1837.01 E:0.328288 |  It's swung in by Young and then punched away by goalkeeper Ross Spina where it was right
[583.84 - 586.96] P:1837.47 E:0.318347 |  under his nose, but it's come out for Trippias who swells it in.
[587.08 - 590.96] P:1718.62 E:0.280370 |  And it takes a flick off a Colombian head and bounces out of play just next to the corner
[590.96 - 591.96] P:1690.39 E:0.284143 |  flag for an England corner.
[591.96 - 595.84] P:1727.18 E:0.319319 |  The first corner, Ashley Young's going to come across and keep an eye on McGuire and
[595.84 - 596.84] P:1921.32 E:0.250019 |  Stones here.
[596.84 - 603.12] P:1912.61 E:0.289857 |  They're saying they're getting obviously as we've saw cuddled as they describe it now.
[603.12 - 605.08] P:1913.21 E:0.345608 |  Every set piece, but we'll see here.
[605.08 - 610.20] P:2043.44 E:0.310846 |  But normally they just hang this up to the penalty spot and let them not attack it.
[610.20 - 615.44] P:1932.45 E:0.332358 |  The referee is very close now to a huddle of players, four England men, four Colombians.
[616.44 - 620.40] P:1911.27 E:0.329825 |  Young to take the corner, drives it in towards the back post.
[620.40 - 621.84] P:1947.91 E:0.289839 |  Ross Spina catches it.
[621.84 - 626.20] P:1763.69 E:0.336448 |  Harry Kane, meanwhile, was in a heap with Carlos Sanchez on the edge of the penalty area,
[626.20 - 630.80] P:1808.70 E:0.303322 |  but they're breaking downfield with left back Mohica who shows far too much of that.
[630.80 - 634.56] P:1752.39 E:0.295734 |  And England come bursting forward with Trippia down the right hand side and then the ball
[634.56 - 640.24] P:1832.76 E:0.294189 |  is deflected out of play by Sanchez for what is a throw in on the far side.
[640.24 - 642.28] P:1721.07 E:0.257695 |  Yeah, I think England has started pretty bright.
[642.28 - 644.08] P:1731.96 E:0.309265 |  They've just got to settle down in possession now.
[644.20 - 648.00] P:1819.29 E:0.284620 |  At the tempo they've got to winning the ball back and the energy so far.
[648.00 - 650.04] P:1753.01 E:0.316872 |  But when they get the ball, they've got to relax.
[650.04 - 652.00] P:1797.13 E:0.290261 |  You know, there's two buttons A and B.
[652.00 - 653.16] P:1664.00 E:0.314034 |  Go and get it back, press A.
[653.16 - 654.92] P:1810.04 E:0.304805 |  When you get it, relax, press B.
[654.92 - 656.48] P:1696.65 E:0.303713 |  In a minute, then up, press B.
[656.48 - 657.28] P:1771.95 E:0.330976 |  That's Chris Waddle.
[657.28 - 660.24] P:1773.99 E:0.310029 |  Get a word from Terry Butcher behind one of the goals.
[660.24 - 665.64] P:1742.83 E:0.331582 |  When we get an opportunity, I just noticed down to our left, Hamas Rodriguez, who's not involved.
[665.64 - 671.60] P:1817.29 E:0.287235 |  His injury, his calf injury has kept him out and he's just been guided to a seat in the stands.
[671.60 - 672.72] P:1709.25 E:0.304992 |  Nowhere near the bench actually.
[672.76 - 675.76] P:1781.53 E:0.297209 |  Chris Waddle over to our left hand side, closer to the corner flag.
[675.76 - 678.16] P:1867.25 E:0.275344 |  Brilliant commentary position we have here.
[678.16 - 682.16] P:1787.59 E:0.302855 |  Most of this will come, we've been up in the heavens, but now we're down at a low level.
[682.16 - 684.92] P:1749.76 E:0.329395 |  England get this free kick, which is played into the penalty area on the right.
[684.92 - 689.32] P:1798.62 E:0.287109 |  Sterling's after it and there's a deflection behind for another corner to England.
[689.32 - 690.56] P:1885.94 E:0.281494 |  Good free kick again.
[690.56 - 691.96] P:1784.24 E:0.322810 |  Just didn't plant it in the box.
[691.96 - 694.72] P:1836.09 E:0.310606 |  Little bit of movement, trying to get Sterling in down the side.
[694.72 - 698.88] P:1989.91 E:0.324262 |  Good defend and two yellow shirts, getting out for another corner.
[698.88 - 699.92] P:2067.15 E:0.302162 |  Tall England.
[700.00 - 702.84] P:1962.92 E:0.328312 |  So much talk about set pieces, defending of set pieces.
[702.84 - 710.36] P:1969.21 E:0.295208 |  Referee Geiger is speaking to Carlos Sanchez, who is the man who has been assigned Harry Kane.
[710.36 - 713.80] P:1903.74 E:0.287523 |  And as I mentioned, the last corner, they both ended up on the ground.
[713.80 - 717.76] P:1894.77 E:0.301504 |  Kane now, referee says stop, stop, don't take the corner.
[717.76 - 718.80] P:2052.54 E:0.245841 |  Trapia?
[718.80 - 720.28] P:2046.28 E:0.319350 |  They're not listening, they'll still do it.
[720.28 - 722.40] P:2107.65 E:0.271648 |  What? They'll still do it.
[722.40 - 726.08] P:1972.70 E:0.280674 |  Stones is there as well, just next to Harry Kane.
[726.08 - 729.32] P:1995.09 E:0.283542 |  And Trapia still waiting.
[729.40 - 733.04] P:1961.11 E:0.278051 |  Corner for England from the right, it's nil nil on five live.
[733.04 - 737.32] P:1925.10 E:0.327737 |  And here is the delivery from Trapia towards the penalty spot, which is headed away.
[737.32 - 745.20] P:1922.35 E:0.318665 |  And it actually might be run away for Colombia, as it's played for down the right-hand side by Quintero.
[745.20 - 747.56] P:1612.21 E:0.301301 |  England have been able to get back in good numbers.
[747.56 - 750.76] P:1766.51 E:0.263270 |  Arias, the right back, gets it back from Quintero.
[750.76 - 753.28] P:1786.56 E:0.306215 |  It was those two who brought very effectively together.
[753.28 - 755.68] P:1654.42 E:0.316425 |  Quintero's slimy, there was a hand ball there against Lingard.
[755.68 - 762.56] P:1855.54 E:0.285282 |  Referee Geiger ignores that and the ball runs out of play of Nina for a throw in two England just down in front of it.
[762.56 - 764.68] P:1683.59 E:0.310102 |  It was really a terrific tempo about the game now, wasn't it?
[764.68 - 768.36] P:1914.33 E:0.281264 |  The first couple of minutes, they saw a look at each other and dropped off.
[768.36 - 772.48] P:1876.49 E:0.278047 |  And so you can have it for a few seconds, but now it's come to life.
[772.48 - 778.16] P:1719.85 E:0.286879 |  Quadrado with a touch in the centre circle and then the ball finds the three of it out of the far side to Mohica.
[778.16 - 780.36] P:1728.98 E:0.290106 |  Colombia nil, England nil.
[780.36 - 784.28] P:1781.48 E:0.319057 |  And England having had a series of set pieces, free kick.
[785.16 - 792.48] P:1870.26 E:0.322435 |  Corners not able to force a save out of Ospina, just had to take a couple of catches.
[792.48 - 795.52] P:1640.94 E:0.337026 |  He has Arias again on the right-hand side, very highly rated.
[795.52 - 800.12] P:1808.14 E:0.318782 |  He's just won the league with PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands.
[800.12 - 806.48] P:1775.77 E:0.308614 |  The number four, the right back, might well be on the move during the course of this summer, possibly to the Premier League.
[806.48 - 809.32] P:1779.99 E:0.326569 |  The ball's been won back by Trippier and it's bounced to Harry Kane.
[809.32 - 814.00] P:1811.33 E:0.291956 |  Trippier was held back there, but Kane takes it on through the middle, but then gives it back to Lingard.
[814.08 - 815.96] P:1905.57 E:0.310428 |  One-two, Lingard with Sterling.
[815.96 - 819.04] P:1957.72 E:0.278514 |  Still the orange boots of Lingard in possession.
[819.04 - 821.88] P:1927.12 E:0.299999 |  And then a pass to Jung. Jung goes past Arias.
[821.88 - 827.00] P:1903.58 E:0.306838 |  Jung now, Sterling tried to give it back to Jung in the area, but it was blocked towards the dead ball line.
[827.00 - 830.92] P:1879.87 E:0.297210 |  And I'm not sure that Barrios kept that in.
[830.92 - 832.08] P:1889.16 E:0.270585 |  He didn't, it's corner.
[832.08 - 834.32] P:1777.64 E:0.304717 |  Yeah, it's another corner to England. We've seen the benefit of it.
[834.32 - 838.92] P:1836.76 E:0.291497 |  Rebler at first, I thought he did, but I thought he did as well there with the replay shows he did there.
[838.92 - 844.72] P:1920.20 E:0.315089 |  Once we get a moment, we will have a word from Terry Butcher, who is watching from ground level.
[844.72 - 850.12] P:1969.76 E:0.306717 |  But Jung with this corner, the referee's got his hands full here. Henderson makes a little run.
[850.12 - 852.12] P:2077.31 E:0.285918 |  Jung still waits.
[852.12 - 858.32] P:1914.79 E:0.298497 |  Kane and Maguire at the back post, as a Colombian gone down, and that's given us a free kick against John Stokes.
[858.32 - 861.00] P:1845.30 E:0.316300 |  They're clever. They're clever how they make it the other way, don't they?
[861.00 - 865.60] P:1777.11 E:0.270052 |  They go down first and they're saying, we're not doing anything. They are, they're holding them.
[865.68 - 871.16] P:1841.22 E:0.273442 |  Instead he's got his hands full. I think the Colombians have as well, but they can just say there,
[871.16 - 877.48] P:1848.73 E:0.279771 |  look, if John Stokes does push it away, obviously he falls to the floor, very dramatically, gets the free kick.
[877.48 - 882.48] P:1836.29 E:0.301425 |  Ten minutes played, Colombia, Neil England, Nell, whatever you made of the start, Terry Butcher down at pitch level.
[882.48 - 886.32] P:1778.66 E:0.377334 |  Whereas Fars is right down the other end to me, I can't see much, I need binoculars, but I'll tell you what,
[886.32 - 891.04] P:1840.37 E:0.369421 |  when England get the ball, a mootable quickly up to Sterling. Sterling's one-on-one against the big boy, Mina.
[891.04 - 894.72] P:1953.28 E:0.352201 |  Hight disadvantage, of course, but more of an advantage on the floor.
[894.72 - 898.20] P:1884.85 E:0.352478 |  Get the ball to Sterling a lot quicker. You've got a free kick just outside the box, didn't you?
[898.20 - 901.88] P:1865.69 E:0.351184 |  If England can get the ball to Sterling, one-on-one against Mina, that's where they'll get in.
[903.12 - 911.40] P:1726.76 E:0.313501 |  Thanks, Terry. Here in Trippia, wins the header, which is deflected out of play near the halfway line on the far side of the field.
[911.40 - 916.96] P:1819.33 E:0.321055 |  Two tears all the way around. Hospitality boxers dotted around the central section.
[916.96 - 920.96] P:1829.67 E:0.319867 |  Diego Maradona is one of those. He's been invited by FIFA this evening.
[921.28 - 928.04] P:1860.23 E:0.302058 |  As a special guest, Sosman Pablo Angel, by the way, as well as a Colombian guest.
[928.04 - 935.68] P:1902.79 E:0.311457 |  Another Colombian we know well from the Premier League, and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, is here as well.
[936.28 - 940.04] P:1959.01 E:0.316933 |  Here is John Stones with the ball halfway inside his own heart.
[940.04 - 944.28] P:1977.37 E:0.318485 |  Stones score with two goals, his first two for England against Panama.
[944.28 - 947.56] P:1908.84 E:0.305671 |  The last time most of these players played, nine days ago.
[947.60 - 951.40] P:1764.45 E:0.327761 |  That wasn't the case with Colombia, who had to win and did and won the group.
[951.40 - 956.88] P:1817.69 E:0.269404 |  And Raheem Sterling, well, Mina is all over him.
[956.88 - 960.36] P:1787.49 E:0.258252 |  And he must be for talking chocolate bars.
[960.36 - 964.16] P:1805.88 E:0.272013 |  He's a full selection box taller than Raheem Sterling.
[964.16 - 966.40] P:1807.56 E:0.276150 |  And he was all over the back of him.
[966.40 - 972.04] P:1796.72 E:0.286190 |  That was a little bit like it's a knockout in it, when you get the big jump on the little thing, trying to ride it away.
[972.04 - 974.84] P:1731.26 E:0.306538 |  I saw you with your little Russian dolls, by the way.
[974.96 - 976.84] P:1652.44 E:0.287295 |  The video on social media.
[976.84 - 978.56] P:1901.01 E:0.270466 |  Very good.
[978.56 - 981.00] P:1634.32 E:0.321252 |  Raheem Sterling was one of... Was he the last one?
[981.00 - 984.56] P:1869.41 E:0.288915 |  Was it him or Kieran Trippier? Was it the little one?
[984.56 - 988.16] P:1886.40 E:0.315341 |  You can see that on the Five Lives social media feed.
[988.16 - 991.84] P:1889.06 E:0.295968 |  Free kick, forward of the centre circle for England.
[991.84 - 993.36] P:1942.96 E:0.288719 |  Trippier and Jung.
[993.36 - 995.32] P:1843.35 E:0.327339 |  It's going to be Trippier who's going to lift it in.
[995.32 - 998.60] P:1809.76 E:0.299583 |  But this is a major feature of this match so far.
[998.60 - 1001.28] P:1804.94 E:0.303144 |  The tangling between defenders and England forwards.
[1001.28 - 1003.68] P:1692.64 E:0.312114 |  Here's the delivery from Trippier, but it's headed away.
[1003.68 - 1005.96] P:1882.97 E:0.280937 |  And there's a flick from Quintero.
[1005.96 - 1009.68] P:1769.43 E:0.235164 |  Fadrado had to make room behind himself.
[1009.68 - 1012.08] P:1495.46 E:0.304229 |  And then plays it back to Sanchez, who hits it long downfield.
[1012.08 - 1014.12] P:1770.32 E:0.315295 |  Jung with a header. Oh, that's missed it.
[1014.12 - 1016.12] P:1772.75 E:0.359121 |  An air kick. Sterling edge of the area.
[1016.12 - 1019.40] P:1746.24 E:0.315735 |  Opens up. He shoots straight into the back of Davinson Sanchez.
[1019.40 - 1022.52] P:1690.08 E:0.296311 |  Now, Deli Ali is beaten to a bouncing ball.
[1022.52 - 1024.72] P:1730.82 E:0.280256 |  Trippier, though, takes it on past Mohica.
[1024.72 - 1026.72] P:1578.19 E:0.306675 |  Could be something for England down the right-hand side.
[1026.72 - 1029.48] P:1621.14 E:0.280550 |  Mohica, the number 17 has got back into position, though,
[1029.48 - 1031.20] P:1728.44 E:0.274424 |  and has taken the ball away from Trippier.
[1031.20 - 1033.20] P:1761.69 E:0.302115 |  And then it's played forward by Davinson.
[1033.20 - 1035.20] P:1619.13 E:0.331004 |  Sanchez, nil nil. It's all England, John.
[1035.20 - 1037.92] P:1815.77 E:0.273643 |  And you can see the game planned from...
[1039.48 - 1041.68] P:2032.96 E:0.372013 |  Clumbier is just basically frustrated, frustrated.
[1041.68 - 1044.60] P:2056.64 E:0.319258 |  Hope England tear out, then they can get up the field themselves
[1044.60 - 1046.20] P:1987.00 E:0.346582 |  and maybe put some footballer there.
[1046.20 - 1050.16] P:2030.77 E:0.323863 |  But it's all England and Clumbier just stopping them playing.
[1051.28 - 1054.48] P:1838.67 E:0.279800 |  Their coach, Jose Peckerman, is watching on.
[1054.48 - 1057.16] P:1771.69 E:0.289439 |  And he's 68 years old.
[1057.20 - 1061.44] P:1714.75 E:0.288130 |  He's got so very hair. He's got rather a ghostly look to him, I always think.
[1061.44 - 1064.72] P:1810.97 E:0.323088 |  But he has reached the World Cup quarter-finals twice
[1064.72 - 1067.48] P:1706.84 E:0.314762 |  as a coach with Argentina, his native Argentina,
[1067.48 - 1069.48] P:1587.76 E:0.330260 |  and also with Columbia four years ago.
[1069.48 - 1072.48] P:1766.70 E:0.290644 |  The first time that Columbia have reached the last aid of the World Cup,
[1072.48 - 1075.48] P:1737.51 E:0.241898 |  and they're looking to match that here, but it's nil nil.
[1075.48 - 1077.28] P:1718.10 E:0.270902 |  Ball out towards the left-hand side.
[1077.28 - 1079.96] P:1677.21 E:0.288347 |  Here is Mohica again. Two England players with it.
[1079.96 - 1083.28] P:1713.96 E:0.288870 |  Deli Ali and Trippier. Mohica takes it on down the left,
[1083.28 - 1086.92] P:1869.38 E:0.331801 |  and then Trippier puts in a very strong challenge to take the ball.
[1086.92 - 1089.48] P:1942.29 E:0.302027 |  And a bit of the man. It's a throwing.
[1089.48 - 1091.40] P:1836.08 E:0.313592 |  Only played it back off Mohica,
[1091.40 - 1093.40] P:1850.88 E:0.299547 |  and a throwing to England in their right back position.
[1093.40 - 1095.72] P:1696.23 E:0.326098 |  I think that's the weakness of the back four, Mohica for me.
[1095.72 - 1100.44] P:1832.32 E:0.270637 |  I think if you can get still in, I know he's playing more of a centre forward at the minute.
[1100.44 - 1102.64] P:1633.02 E:0.333341 |  He's getting crowded out. A lot of change. He picks the ball up.
[1102.64 - 1105.16] P:1774.54 E:0.305312 |  Well, I think you get a lot of joy if you went and stood out there.
[1105.16 - 1109.40] P:1763.72 E:0.292239 |  He was at Real Balacarno, Johan Mohica,
[1109.40 - 1113.92] P:1859.02 E:0.275716 |  moved to Girona, and has now signed permanently.
[1113.92 - 1117.08] P:1929.16 E:0.326431 |  And he is operating.
[1117.08 - 1119.96] P:1877.44 E:0.321393 |  There's an awful lot being asked of him, has left back and also
[1119.96 - 1122.92] P:1846.31 E:0.315634 |  has an attacking force down the left-hand side.
[1122.92 - 1126.92] P:1802.06 E:0.290689 |  Throwing taken up towards Harry Kane, but it bounces off the England captain.
[1126.92 - 1129.96] P:1670.81 E:0.308742 |  And out of play for a throw in the other halfway line to Colombia.
[1129.96 - 1133.40] P:1779.31 E:0.279275 |  That Mohica will take. Brilliant atmosphere.
[1133.40 - 1136.04] P:1671.08 E:0.320892 |  You can hear the drums. I presume that's the England band.
[1136.04 - 1137.08] P:1811.04 E:0.248403 |  Yeah.
[1137.08 - 1139.80] P:1609.54 E:0.326112 |  But I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was a Colombian band.
[1139.80 - 1143.44] P:1730.13 E:0.310419 |  And it's a feature as well, with notice, the South Americans.
[1143.44 - 1147.24] P:1742.64 E:0.296839 |  Many of them have actually come as families with little children
[1147.24 - 1149.92] P:1711.87 E:0.263706 |  all the way from South America to Russia.
[1149.92 - 1152.84] P:1750.30 E:0.308016 |  Here's Ospina. High pass out towards this side,
[1152.84 - 1158.40] P:1791.74 E:0.271160 |  the Colombian right, and Arias cangles with Jung.
[1158.40 - 1161.68] P:1641.58 E:0.296521 |  The ball of age, both of them, and it's out of play for a throw in to England.
[1161.68 - 1165.80] P:1723.67 E:0.306283 |  Arias is complaining that Jung's challenge should have been given as a free kick.
[1165.80 - 1169.24] P:1856.76 E:0.309873 |  I think a lot of people were surprised at the selection of the referee.
[1169.24 - 1172.12] P:1996.20 E:0.266263 |  Mark Geiger.
[1172.12 - 1174.44] P:1980.84 E:0.304554 |  From the United States.
[1174.44 - 1177.84] P:1927.38 E:0.291638 |  Here's Trippier, who plays it down the right flank.
[1177.84 - 1180.84] P:1851.69 E:0.284667 |  And this time, Lingard catches up with it. Lingard.
[1180.84 - 1183.32] P:1857.11 E:0.290965 |  Lingard up against Jefferson Lermer.
[1183.32 - 1185.80] P:1843.03 E:0.344084 |  And then the overlapping run, it's one to the back post!
[1185.80 - 1188.36] P:1759.90 E:0.319286 |  And a hanging header from Harry Kane.
[1188.36 - 1190.36] P:1868.08 E:0.265362 |  Lands on the roof of the net.
[1190.36 - 1194.64] P:1783.95 E:0.315096 |  What a great move. Trippie, really, really gets great control of the ball.
[1194.64 - 1197.16] P:1857.41 E:0.244384 |  Perfectly tamed Brun.
[1197.16 - 1199.96] P:1758.04 E:0.299238 |  Oh, and Harry Kane just can't get above it. He had it down.
[1200.00 - 1201.00] P:1715.49 E:0.310716 |  He heads that down trip.
[1201.00 - 1202.84] P:1807.38 E:0.257101 |  Wonderful across the far post.
[1202.84 - 1206.04] P:1830.70 E:0.268679 |  Harry Kane's always reaching, but if he could just head it down,
[1206.04 - 1207.04] P:1542.97 E:0.310790 |  that's wonderful.
[1207.04 - 1209.00] P:1751.68 E:0.284595 |  It goes over, lands on the roof of the net.
[1209.00 - 1211.24] P:1757.11 E:0.306452 |  Kane was beyond the far post.
[1211.24 - 1213.72] P:1877.46 E:0.293264 |  The cross was ripped by Trippier.
[1213.72 - 1215.96] P:1856.12 E:0.283118 |  And Kane threw himself at it.
[1215.96 - 1219.88] P:1720.22 E:0.295495 |  And ended up diving off the pitch a little bit like Trevor Francis,
[1219.88 - 1224.04] P:1669.74 E:0.326601 |  when he scored the European final goal against Malmo,
[1224.04 - 1227.20] P:1731.59 E:0.297362 |  but he couldn't direct it into the roof of the net and it landed on the top.
[1227.20 - 1229.36] P:1683.85 E:0.327989 |  And he's got a couple eyes of a join this so far.
[1229.44 - 1231.36] P:1557.16 E:0.314566 |  They're dominating the game. They've got to put the ball in the net,
[1231.36 - 1233.96] P:1783.64 E:0.299112 |  because they will, Ty Ali always do. We know that.
[1233.96 - 1237.92] P:1787.81 E:0.273623 |  And you don't want Columbia coming out second half, dominating the play.
[1237.92 - 1242.16] P:1800.88 E:0.276850 |  And we can see, can't we, that Quintero and Cuadrado,
[1242.16 - 1244.40] P:1934.17 E:0.244594 |  and potentially Falco,
[1244.40 - 1247.56] P:1869.45 E:0.273163 |  could potentially carry danger
[1247.56 - 1251.08] P:1747.17 E:0.266267 |  when Columbia break forwards on the counterattack.
[1251.08 - 1254.92] P:1657.75 E:0.295399 |  Espina, the Arsenal goalkeeper, 29 years old,
[1254.92 - 1256.40] P:1685.12 E:0.305103 |  clears it up towards the half-way line.
[1256.44 - 1259.76] P:1705.44 E:0.269656 |  Maguire wins ahead at, and now in centrefield,
[1259.76 - 1264.16] P:1795.69 E:0.266567 |  it's played back to the number five, Wilmar Barrios,
[1264.16 - 1266.64] P:1588.95 E:0.317309 |  who's one of the two players that came into the Columbia side,
[1266.64 - 1269.72] P:1765.65 E:0.307252 |  Loma as well, in midfield, central midfield,
[1269.72 - 1274.60] P:1783.39 E:0.269127 |  Nohames Rodriguez, not on the bench either, injured at Kaft Problem.
[1274.60 - 1277.00] P:1705.68 E:0.297634 |  And England playing the same team, if you just switched on,
[1277.00 - 1279.28] P:1682.07 E:0.245012 |  if you've got back into your car on the way home,
[1279.28 - 1281.76] P:1689.84 E:0.292054 |  England the same team that played against Tunisia
[1281.76 - 1283.72] P:1781.87 E:0.252242 |  in the first match of this World Cup.
[1283.72 - 1286.20] P:1768.64 E:0.318659 |  These two tonight playing for a place in the quarterfinals
[1286.20 - 1289.76] P:1821.64 E:0.269006 |  of the World Cup, where they would play Sweden
[1289.76 - 1293.44] P:1702.84 E:0.231753 |  on Saturday in Samara.
[1293.44 - 1296.00] P:1764.71 E:0.226406 |  Here is Carlos Sanchez,
[1296.00 - 1299.28] P:1791.96 E:0.239768 |  sent off in the third minute of the first match.
[1299.28 - 1301.84] P:1714.57 E:0.270982 |  Plays the ball back towards the half-way line,
[1301.84 - 1305.44] P:1696.44 E:0.295235 |  and Columbia with a little spell of possession for themselves.
[1305.44 - 1309.00] P:1774.56 E:0.276756 |  After good England pressure, won four corners,
[1309.00 - 1310.88] P:1621.97 E:0.270971 |  Harry Kane has had that header,
[1310.88 - 1313.56] P:1574.55 E:0.299691 |  and here they come now with Cuadrado of Juventus.
[1313.60 - 1315.80] P:1743.17 E:0.258654 |  Contaro moves in field,
[1315.80 - 1318.28] P:1616.88 E:0.309345 |  Deli Alidore has gone with him, and staying very tight.
[1318.28 - 1321.84] P:1710.96 E:0.314299 |  Little Contaro, who can only be 5'6", 5'8".
[1321.84 - 1322.84] P:1749.52 E:0.250979 |  Very good player.
[1322.84 - 1325.36] P:1686.19 E:0.282434 |  Swings the ball out towards the left-hand side,
[1325.36 - 1331.12] P:1876.19 E:0.284474 |  and now Columbia start again with Jefferson Loma,
[1331.12 - 1333.04] P:1805.87 E:0.294983 |  and now stepping forward from the back,
[1333.04 - 1337.68] P:1778.32 E:0.274131 |  Big Yeri Mina, Contaro on the right-hand side.
[1337.68 - 1338.88] P:1547.69 E:0.327503 |  A left-footer ball over the top,
[1338.88 - 1341.96] P:1846.41 E:0.300602 |  but that will bounce harmlessly through to Pickford,
[1341.96 - 1343.16] P:1711.39 E:0.315999 |  from an England point of view.
[1343.16 - 1344.64] P:1734.40 E:0.325536 |  Did anyone pick the ball at Quintero?
[1344.64 - 1346.40] P:1799.28 E:0.327956 |  Valves Falco or Cuadrado?
[1346.40 - 1347.60] P:2000.77 E:0.286560 |  I've just made runs,
[1347.60 - 1350.60] P:2014.03 E:0.311983 |  because he's got that much ability in that left-foot.
[1350.60 - 1353.72] P:1887.53 E:0.317168 |  Already in the game, he's been their best player by far.
[1353.72 - 1356.24] P:1814.37 E:0.301329 |  He sees a pass, he needs movement.
[1356.24 - 1358.08] P:1872.50 E:0.271086 |  Cal Warg has tripped over,
[1358.08 - 1359.84] P:1605.27 E:0.324287 |  as he runs the ball away from the penalty area,
[1359.84 - 1361.48] P:1913.29 E:0.271240 |  free kick, which England take quickly.
[1361.48 - 1363.20] P:1878.50 E:0.285552 |  Here's one up towards Harry Kane,
[1363.20 - 1364.40] P:1841.82 E:0.276581 |  Nina has gone with him.
[1364.40 - 1366.64] P:1801.56 E:0.292697 |  Kane actually moves into his own half
[1366.64 - 1370.32] P:1958.58 E:0.268879 |  before he plays it back towards John Stones.
[1370.96 - 1373.12] P:1943.10 E:0.303965 |  Return pass from Jordan Henderson.
[1373.12 - 1374.24] P:1915.61 E:0.354581 |  Stones now a little bolder,
[1374.24 - 1376.64] P:1941.28 E:0.314446 |  Sterling, Sterling squared towards Kane.
[1376.64 - 1378.72] P:1862.06 E:0.323820 |  Now Dali Ali gets involved as well.
[1378.72 - 1380.16] P:1936.53 E:0.306521 |  England playing from right to left,
[1380.16 - 1382.16] P:2009.69 E:0.287196 |  the score is nil-nil,
[1382.16 - 1385.92] P:1915.69 E:0.340356 |  and John Stones whistles from all of these Colombian supporters
[1385.92 - 1388.32] P:1965.04 E:0.292362 |  in the stadium here in Moscow,
[1388.32 - 1390.08] P:1925.37 E:0.308347 |  because England are intersession.
[1390.08 - 1391.96] P:1943.42 E:0.327147 |  Harry Maguire up towards Kane.
[1391.96 - 1394.28] P:1908.75 E:0.298550 |  Once again, Barrios this time,
[1394.28 - 1396.36] P:1869.44 E:0.309069 |  is extremely tight on Harry Kane.
[1396.36 - 1399.52] P:1862.25 E:0.314579 |  They are very, very aware of the Kane danger.
[1399.60 - 1402.40] P:1662.68 E:0.322321 |  Kane then spins a pass out towards the right-hand side.
[1402.40 - 1403.88] P:1863.14 E:0.275683 |  Goodness, he struck that well.
[1403.88 - 1405.56] P:1812.16 E:0.304130 |  Trippie now with the ball at his feet.
[1405.56 - 1406.92] P:1809.74 E:0.309630 |  Trippie looking for support,
[1406.92 - 1410.96] P:1868.25 E:0.330874 |  and Mojica puts in the challenge for a huge cheer
[1410.96 - 1412.32] P:1712.16 E:0.333155 |  from the Colombian fans,
[1412.32 - 1414.68] P:1680.23 E:0.328285 |  but all he can do is pass it straight out of play for a throw.
[1414.68 - 1415.52] P:1628.13 E:0.257017 |  Nil-nil.
[1415.52 - 1418.76] P:1597.13 E:0.293693 |  So far, I think the teams are playing into the Colombian's hands,
[1418.76 - 1420.36] P:1736.71 E:0.267959 |  going in the middle all the time.
[1420.36 - 1422.24] P:1622.71 E:0.350257 |  They've got a lot of yellow shirts in the middle of the park,
[1422.24 - 1423.84] P:1653.12 E:0.252214 |  hand in front, the centre-halves.
[1423.84 - 1425.76] P:1684.02 E:0.330968 |  I think they're going to get more joy as we saw Trippie
[1425.76 - 1427.76] P:1764.34 E:0.297702 |  put a cross in from the ball in on the right.
[1427.76 - 1430.20] P:1767.06 E:0.321906 |  When he does, she only gets further forward and wider.
[1431.92 - 1434.68] P:1856.53 E:0.279651 |  Nil-nil, almost 20 minutes played.
[1434.68 - 1436.44] P:1472.88 E:0.330568 |  As I said, these England players, most of them,
[1436.44 - 1437.96] P:1647.47 E:0.317102 |  nine changes from the Belgium game,
[1437.96 - 1441.72] P:1741.90 E:0.311443 |  only Tickford and Stones are the two to keep the places,
[1441.72 - 1444.96] P:1802.51 E:0.292302 |  and they've started all of the matches at this World Cup so far,
[1444.96 - 1449.36] P:1811.27 E:0.286058 |  whereas Colombia had to win their second-two group matches
[1449.36 - 1452.28] P:1637.13 E:0.314452 |  against Poland, which they did very well, 3-0, remember,
[1452.28 - 1454.68] P:1607.51 E:0.308706 |  and 1-0 against Sanagall to win the group.
[1454.68 - 1456.68] P:1743.97 E:0.321041 |  He has Jali Ali on the left-hand side.
[1456.72 - 1458.52] P:1733.51 E:0.327196 |  Ali does well, holds off two men.
[1458.52 - 1461.20] P:1806.49 E:0.307278 |  Sterling then into the area, but Barrios went with him,
[1461.20 - 1463.80] P:1829.33 E:0.301518 |  and Sterling, as he looked to poke it across, missed it,
[1463.80 - 1465.32] P:1782.57 E:0.334467 |  and it rolled behind for a goal kick.
[1465.32 - 1466.80] P:1698.39 E:0.320284 |  He's getting some good areas there, Sterling,
[1466.80 - 1469.72] P:1694.06 E:0.287836 |  but he's just touched his deserved rims tonight, isn't it?
[1469.72 - 1475.16] P:1801.53 E:0.272687 |  It's a one-shot block, but he's got to look after the ball a lot better.
[1475.16 - 1479.32] P:1686.15 E:0.291555 |  He tried to check it back, and missed it, at the same time also.
[1479.32 - 1483.24] P:1723.69 E:0.285521 |  I mean, Barrios was certainly touched tight.
[1483.24 - 1485.00] P:1667.50 E:0.306162 |  He had his hands on his chest,
[1485.00 - 1487.52] P:1629.84 E:0.322612 |  but Sterling had already lost the ball over the dead ball line.
[1487.52 - 1491.60] P:1783.81 E:0.306727 |  Colombia nail England nil, so we've played 20 minutes.
[1491.60 - 1493.72] P:1788.83 E:0.296693 |  England have had the better of it.
[1493.72 - 1496.80] P:1796.63 E:0.302094 |  England had a number of set pieces.
[1496.80 - 1502.36] P:1736.04 E:0.308384 |  They're all still waiting for the first goal of this last 16 match.
[1502.36 - 1506.20] P:1658.13 E:0.299546 |  Sweden winning 1-0 against Switzerland up in St Petersburg,
[1506.20 - 1509.76] P:1924.89 E:0.307967 |  and our first commentary match of the day.
[1509.76 - 1512.76] P:1764.33 E:0.316654 |  In football, at least, we've had a number of tennis commentary matches for you.
[1512.88 - 1518.12] P:1812.00 E:0.285582 |  Wimbledon coverage will continue tomorrow at 11 o'clock on Five Live Sports Extra.
[1518.12 - 1520.40] P:1738.35 E:0.327986 |  The ball played up towards Harry Kane near the edge of the box.
[1520.40 - 1527.04] P:1863.49 E:0.274521 |  Davinson Sanchez wins it against his club mate, the two Tottenham men.
[1527.04 - 1531.80] P:1738.63 E:0.272981 |  And Cuadrado now has the ball for Colombia here on the right-hand side,
[1531.80 - 1533.88] P:1808.47 E:0.258691 |  and makes good ground down the right.
[1533.88 - 1536.20] P:1806.80 E:0.275730 |  Deli Ali has tracked his run.
[1536.20 - 1537.32] P:1498.44 E:0.318421 |  Arias is there as well.
[1537.32 - 1540.68] P:1813.06 E:0.286888 |  Quintero, who's played mainly on the right-ish side.
[1541.60 - 1543.80] P:1776.23 E:0.293011 |  Yellow shirt outside his white shorts.
[1543.80 - 1545.92] P:1711.89 E:0.281782 |  Then begins to weave back towards the right.
[1545.92 - 1547.92] P:1717.17 E:0.284247 |  Cuadrado makes himself available.
[1547.92 - 1550.28] P:1612.35 E:0.321201 |  Mohica is there out on the far side,
[1550.28 - 1556.28] P:1710.94 E:0.282048 |  but Cuadrado keeps it centrally and goes back towards the halfway line to Davinson Sanchez.
[1556.28 - 1561.92] P:1723.95 E:0.315455 |  The little number five, Barrios, now pulls the pass here to the right-hand side,
[1561.92 - 1563.16] P:1747.81 E:0.301720 |  to Carlos Sanchez.
[1563.16 - 1567.32] P:1753.93 E:0.314411 |  Sanchez goes for a quick ball towards Valcao, centrally just outside the D.
[1567.32 - 1569.28] P:1742.21 E:0.311136 |  And then a touch from Cuadrado.
[1569.28 - 1572.12] P:1864.12 E:0.335457 |  Cuadrado hits a shot, it deflects to Valcao,
[1572.12 - 1575.80] P:1682.81 E:0.310948 |  but Valcao couldn't get the ball under control, and it's stabbed away by Maguire.
[1575.80 - 1578.68] P:1839.71 E:0.340890 |  Only to Mohica, who hits an awful shot,
[1578.68 - 1583.20] P:1788.22 E:0.328536 |  which flies away not far away from where Terry Butcher is sitting behind the goal.
[1583.20 - 1585.20] P:1845.64 E:0.285988 |  So give us another thought, Terry.
[1585.20 - 1588.64] P:1886.88 E:0.339532 |  Well, it missed me by a mile, John, so I'm pretty safe here, but...
[1588.64 - 1592.12] P:1813.03 E:0.365001 |  Cuadrado is the one for me on the right-hand side, coming in, he's in between.
[1592.12 - 1595.00] P:1935.99 E:0.377248 |  Howie Maguire doesn't know if he can go down to him, John Stone doesn't know,
[1595.00 - 1597.80] P:1987.90 E:0.347314 |  but as Valco came short and got the ball,
[1597.80 - 1599.80] P:1962.08 E:0.375620 |  John Stone's got to concentrate a little bit more
[1599.80 - 1602.84] P:1981.11 E:0.362102 |  and make sure that they pick up these runs before they make any danger.
[1602.84 - 1605.88] P:1928.01 E:0.361723 |  But so Cuadrado is the one, if you allow him to get on the ball,
[1605.88 - 1610.48] P:1919.58 E:0.346781 |  he's very dangerous, puts a sporadic attack from Columbia in dominating so far.
[1610.48 - 1613.00] P:1992.89 E:0.318712 |  But as Chris says, haven't made it count.
[1613.00 - 1616.48] P:1898.93 E:0.303849 |  John Stone's is in possession, he has his back to Terry.
[1616.48 - 1619.56] P:1682.60 E:0.330132 |  We're looking across at him, slightly left of the halfway lane,
[1619.56 - 1621.48] P:1745.56 E:0.348788 |  but we really feel where we're sitting here,
[1621.48 - 1624.72] P:1621.14 E:0.308908 |  part of the atmosphere inside this stadium this evening.
[1624.72 - 1627.52] P:1732.64 E:0.299081 |  Here is Deli Alley now, through the middle.
[1627.60 - 1631.68] P:1739.24 E:0.322605 |  Ashley Young, Ashley Young has Arias snapping away at him,
[1631.68 - 1634.12] P:1755.75 E:0.318070 |  and Arias got a touch and that's carried it to Quintero.
[1634.12 - 1636.52] P:1769.85 E:0.324226 |  Quintero slips it through the legs of Harry Maguire
[1636.52 - 1638.64] P:1737.97 E:0.297352 |  and now Cuadrado is looking for Valco
[1638.64 - 1645.08] P:1792.99 E:0.267914 |  and Walker was able to adjust and play it away to Kieran Trippier.
[1645.08 - 1650.96] P:1836.24 E:0.254772 |  Just a couple of instances, the last two Colombian attacks,
[1650.96 - 1654.44] P:1786.79 E:0.339123 |  where England have just been stretched a little as Columbia come forward
[1654.44 - 1656.24] P:1719.04 E:0.320029 |  and now they've got a point on the far side for them.
[1656.28 - 1661.12] P:1714.03 E:0.313968 |  They're not a bad say, we're not saying that England should just be dominating the game.
[1661.12 - 1664.52] P:1804.55 E:0.277040 |  We'll say, you've got to be away, Cuadrado, especially for me,
[1664.52 - 1667.60] P:1872.86 E:0.303728 |  as I've said earlier, real talent.
[1667.60 - 1669.92] P:1820.15 E:0.304869 |  Yeah, Quintero, centrally at the moment.
[1669.92 - 1673.16] P:1818.00 E:0.312657 |  The ball's back on the halfway lane with Cuadrado.
[1673.16 - 1676.80] P:1722.35 E:0.322339 |  He's got some movement in this system that Peckerman is playing tonight.
[1676.80 - 1680.24] P:1819.43 E:0.326720 |  Lots of movement and now Lerner,
[1680.24 - 1683.60] P:1739.41 E:0.318644 |  high pass towards the right flank, but Ashley Young wins it in the air.
[1683.68 - 1688.88] P:1652.88 E:0.316853 |  That's already a very good contest, Arias against Young on this side of the field.
[1688.88 - 1693.00] P:1745.51 E:0.314619 |  Arias now, Quintero cuts it back and beats Deli Ali
[1693.00 - 1694.84] P:1634.55 E:0.333986 |  and then slips the ball through to Arias in the box,
[1694.84 - 1698.60] P:1662.31 E:0.294598 |  but Harry Maguire glides across and is able to take the ball away
[1698.60 - 1700.52] P:1709.06 E:0.296336 |  and play it towards the halfway line.
[1700.52 - 1705.04] P:1784.90 E:0.278661 |  Yeah, Columbia having a good spell here, a good five minutes in England.
[1705.04 - 1710.00] P:1675.51 E:0.267946 |  For the first time in the game, they're having to accept that Columbia have possession
[1710.08 - 1712.96] P:1580.28 E:0.282672 |  and they're having to play the game in their own half,
[1712.96 - 1717.36] P:1690.05 E:0.261399 |  while Columbia have the ball, Cuadrado on the right-hand side.
[1717.36 - 1723.36] P:1815.03 E:0.302361 |  Cuadrado then goes back to Nina and then Barrios
[1723.36 - 1726.84] P:1776.64 E:0.311867 |  with the ball through the middle towards Carlos Sanchez.
[1726.84 - 1730.88] P:1706.08 E:0.301137 |  And notice that Peckerman, the coach, dedicated their win over Poland
[1730.88 - 1733.96] P:1750.59 E:0.289839 |  to Carlos Sanchez, who was suspended for that match.
[1733.96 - 1738.36] P:1710.00 E:0.309662 |  Well, there's a poor pass from Lerner, which sails over the head of Cuadrado,
[1738.36 - 1744.52] P:1769.72 E:0.264738 |  who gives Lerner quite a glare on the balls out of play for a throw in to England.
[1744.52 - 1747.36] P:1840.82 E:0.260677 |  So it's Columbia nil, England nil.
[1747.36 - 1751.52] P:1936.18 E:0.317058 |  England also playing tonight back home with Old Trafford in the 2020.
[1751.52 - 1757.24] P:1985.89 E:0.322728 |  England are batting and we have commentary on that over on Five Live Sports Extra.
[1757.24 - 1760.64] P:1977.86 E:0.328326 |  Jimmy Anderson's part of the team again on BBC Radio.
[1760.64 - 1765.24] P:1900.25 E:0.317129 |  So you can listen to that Five Live Sports Extra online, also via the BBC Sport app.
[1765.24 - 1770.20] P:1760.89 E:0.272112 |  And obviously we'll keep you across the score here on Five Live as well.
[1770.20 - 1774.76] P:1755.29 E:0.258915 |  Harry Kane goes for an aerial ball with Nina,
[1774.76 - 1778.64] P:1666.50 E:0.283204 |  and then it's swept away by Davenson Sanchez.
[1778.64 - 1780.92] P:1761.50 E:0.317897 |  But only back to the red shirts of England,
[1780.92 - 1784.52] P:1849.76 E:0.299252 |  and not much in that from Carlos Sanchez on Delhi Ali.
[1784.52 - 1786.64] P:1657.19 E:0.286734 |  Down he went though, Delhi Ali won the free kick.
[1786.64 - 1788.32] P:1767.14 E:0.320501 |  Yeah, they give silly free kicks away.
[1788.32 - 1790.60] P:1713.23 E:0.318646 |  Sometimes it's too easy to win the ball back to Columbia,
[1790.60 - 1792.72] P:1881.51 E:0.310226 |  but the game's sort of leveled off now.
[1792.72 - 1795.00] P:1930.14 E:0.277646 |  We're coming over 25 minutes.
[1795.00 - 1797.56] P:1790.18 E:0.345134 |  England started very bravely, used a lot of energy,
[1797.56 - 1799.16] P:1816.99 E:0.301100 |  they've just slightly come off the pace,
[1799.16 - 1801.12] P:1895.18 E:0.270816 |  but again they've got to set pace here,
[1801.12 - 1803.16] P:1904.18 E:0.257005 |  and we know how threatening they are.
[1803.16 - 1805.96] P:1881.97 E:0.240495 |  Columbia nil, England nil.
[1808.44 - 1813.00] P:1954.70 E:0.323540 |  Young and Lingard over the free kick.
[1813.00 - 1817.28] P:1961.44 E:0.343746 |  It's about four strides in from the nearest touch line to us,
[1817.28 - 1820.24] P:1993.03 E:0.309790 |  just down in front of us, Ashleigh Young.
[1820.36 - 1824.28] P:1957.43 E:0.310924 |  And again the earlier theme now is back with us,
[1824.28 - 1827.44] P:1943.01 E:0.314079 |  as Ashleigh Young drives it in towards the back post,
[1827.44 - 1828.96] P:1837.96 E:0.245484 |  looking for Maguire.
[1828.96 - 1833.08] P:1722.20 E:0.294022 |  He did get his head to it, but it touched the head of Davenson Sanchez as well,
[1833.08 - 1835.24] P:1590.77 E:0.260933 |  and that's taken it behind for an England corner.
[1835.24 - 1837.12] P:1585.73 E:0.320364 |  There was Maguire the target.
[1837.12 - 1839.96] P:1687.15 E:0.320109 |  Yeah, it's worked well for them in this World Cup so far.
[1839.96 - 1842.44] P:1934.65 E:0.316881 |  He gets away, he gets half a yard.
[1842.44 - 1843.96] P:2031.00 E:0.326748 |  There's a collision.
[1843.96 - 1846.60] P:1997.64 E:0.360488 |  Davenson Sanchez is incredibly...
[1846.60 - 1847.76] P:2019.93 E:0.320509 |  He gets just in time.
[1847.80 - 1850.60] P:1947.93 E:0.297822 |  He did well, Sanchez there, Davenson Sanchez.
[1850.60 - 1854.20] P:1957.88 E:0.305804 |  So it's a corner, trippy had to take this one, pushing and shoving.
[1854.20 - 1856.56] P:1892.52 E:0.287839 |  I mean, the referee's standing right next to it.
[1856.56 - 1859.28] P:1987.78 E:0.286271 |  He could almost reach out and touch them.
[1859.28 - 1860.28] P:1939.89 E:0.269660 |  And...
[1861.84 - 1864.56] P:1907.22 E:0.322718 |  It's... He used to say things like this is like an NFL game.
[1864.56 - 1867.48] P:1938.64 E:0.257953 |  It's Lerma, who's in the middle of it,
[1867.48 - 1871.84] P:1967.85 E:0.256876 |  in between Maguire and Stones...
[1871.84 - 1872.84] P:2021.93 E:0.268700 |  Right.
[1872.84 - 1873.84] P:1974.57 E:0.341781 |  It's...
[1873.84 - 1876.64] P:2028.38 E:0.289350 |  It's a seven-game like this.
[1876.68 - 1879.08] P:1992.41 E:0.285419 |  So it is an England corner.
[1879.08 - 1881.68] P:1946.55 E:0.307061 |  Lots of movement, Stones now trying to find some space.
[1881.68 - 1882.80] P:1908.51 E:0.311211 |  Maguire as well.
[1882.80 - 1886.76] P:1849.79 E:0.320383 |  He has trippier with the delivery, and it's headed away by Mina,
[1886.76 - 1889.96] P:1896.87 E:0.307902 |  who got up and won that in no uncertain terms.
[1889.96 - 1892.80] P:1759.95 E:0.289408 |  And now Kyle Walker has to be quick, but of course we know that he is,
[1892.80 - 1895.64] P:1676.39 E:0.287227 |  and Walker gets there ahead of Arias on the halfway line
[1895.64 - 1897.68] P:1902.96 E:0.270092 |  to steer it all the way back to Pickford.
[1897.68 - 1900.24] P:1885.55 E:0.271373 |  I mentioned I'd update you on the England score.
[1900.24 - 1905.04] P:1840.37 E:0.264316 |  England 159 for eight in their 20 overs against India,
[1905.04 - 1909.24] P:1829.02 E:0.254923 |  the first match of the international summer between England and India,
[1909.24 - 1912.28] P:1877.70 E:0.292606 |  and we'll keep you across the Indian innings once it begins,
[1912.28 - 1915.08] P:1936.37 E:0.268302 |  as I say, commentary five lives, four texts.
[1915.08 - 1918.92] P:2019.42 E:0.267419 |  Maguire got the ball near the halfway line.
[1918.92 - 1922.32] P:1979.37 E:0.265706 |  Jesse Lingard drops very deep, nil-nil.
[1922.32 - 1924.76] P:1997.53 E:0.299428 |  And really, in terms of chances,
[1924.76 - 1926.68] P:2051.59 E:0.324605 |  they've had quite a lot of possession.
[1926.68 - 1929.60] P:2024.50 E:0.301043 |  They've had the corners, they've had five corners,
[1929.60 - 1932.68] P:1880.30 E:0.287770 |  that Harry Kane's head up that landed on the roof of the net
[1932.72 - 1935.72] P:1719.33 E:0.276657 |  is the closest that we've come to an opening goal in this match.
[1935.72 - 1938.44] P:1610.98 E:0.295594 |  Yeah, I think England's been a better save.
[1938.44 - 1941.08] P:1763.69 E:0.257261 |  As you say, they've had a lot more possession.
[1941.08 - 1944.96] P:1737.34 E:0.291326 |  Not really, the goalkeepers have no real save to make, either, keep up.
[1944.96 - 1947.36] P:1809.18 E:0.309531 |  So, yeah, England have a lot of ball,
[1947.36 - 1950.68] P:1915.83 E:0.274174 |  but they just can't find that final cross, final pass.
[1950.68 - 1953.08] P:1872.01 E:0.304563 |  Harry Kane's probably had the best chance, which was a difficult one.
[1953.08 - 1956.32] P:1973.08 E:0.257486 |  Yeah, he has Young, Young playing it back,
[1956.32 - 1958.68] P:1783.47 E:0.317166 |  towards the centre-circle to Kyle Walker.
[1958.68 - 1962.36] P:1903.08 E:0.253661 |  Now, very much established as a central defender
[1962.40 - 1965.04] P:1843.04 E:0.289982 |  in this first-choice England starting line-up,
[1965.04 - 1967.20] P:1883.17 E:0.270016 |  which we now know it is.
[1967.20 - 1969.48] P:1883.58 E:0.309673 |  Here is Young towards Lingard.
[1969.48 - 1971.40] P:1758.23 E:0.306740 |  Lingard's little ball towards Harry Kane.
[1971.40 - 1975.76] P:1849.04 E:0.305326 |  Kane, the top scorer at this World Cup, remember, with five goals.
[1975.76 - 1979.28] P:1831.81 E:0.291633 |  Sterling, little click on the edge of the area from Ali.
[1979.28 - 1981.52] P:1754.54 E:0.288856 |  Thought if it slipped it through to Lingard,
[1981.52 - 1983.56] P:1656.36 E:0.280605 |  but it was blocked on the edge of the penalty area.
[1983.56 - 1989.32] P:1838.57 E:0.257651 |  Mojica is being forced to run the ball back into his left back position,
[1989.32 - 1990.92] P:1819.91 E:0.287824 |  and then wins a throw-in.
[1990.92 - 1994.36] P:1728.26 E:0.314833 |  The presser in everything's great. The tempo's good, Johnny.
[1994.36 - 1997.80] P:1812.72 E:0.259582 |  It's just final ball. Relax on the ball and make the pitch bigger.
[1997.80 - 2000.84] P:1792.27 E:0.265177 |  It seems, you know, get away, move it quicker, switch the play.
[2000.84 - 2002.84] P:1803.81 E:0.273132 |  Oh, no.
[2002.84 - 2004.84] P:1858.34 E:0.298603 |  That is ridiculous.
[2004.84 - 2008.44] P:1911.17 E:0.313963 |  That was... Falkau was...
[2008.44 - 2010.44] P:1916.61 E:0.297294 |  Falkau tripped behind him,
[2010.44 - 2015.40] P:1873.62 E:0.289101 |  and Falkau literally dived with arms apart,
[2015.40 - 2018.40] P:1773.58 E:0.265129 |  as if he was jumping into a swimming pool.
[2018.40 - 2020.40] P:1728.70 E:0.297419 |  That would have been a belly flop, if he had.
[2021.40 - 2023.88] P:1782.33 E:0.352190 |  That was shocking. Now, that wasn't enough for him to buy that.
[2023.88 - 2025.88] P:1760.83 E:0.354515 |  The lanes were just two yards away.
[2027.88 - 2030.88] P:1904.34 E:0.347188 |  That's one of the dives of the World Cup.
[2030.88 - 2033.88] P:1935.83 E:0.341994 |  Greg Luganas will be proud of that one.
[2033.88 - 2037.40] P:1814.61 E:0.324763 |  Free kick, won by Falkau, nevertheless.
[2037.40 - 2040.40] P:1750.93 E:0.308947 |  And it's still Columbia Nail, England Nail.
[2040.40 - 2045.16] P:1665.72 E:0.315919 |  There's brilliant Colombian sound inside the stadium in Moscow.
[2045.16 - 2047.16] P:1604.23 E:0.304086 |  That's the World Cup for you, isn't it?
[2047.16 - 2050.16] P:1746.51 E:0.257286 |  The sound of Columbia comes to Moscow.
[2050.40 - 2053.40] P:1768.84 E:0.246880 |  Free kick, taken by Osbina.
[2053.40 - 2057.40] P:1731.67 E:0.255412 |  Tripier gets up very well, headed forwards for England.
[2057.40 - 2060.40] P:1710.47 E:0.284267 |  And then Dali Ali, beaten in the air by Carlos Sanchez.
[2060.40 - 2065.16] P:1801.16 E:0.275571 |  But Harry Maguire is there to lift it forwards for Sterling to chase.
[2065.16 - 2067.16] P:1719.03 E:0.295902 |  Sterling up against Davenson Sanchez.
[2067.16 - 2071.16] P:1867.73 E:0.315201 |  Does well, Sterling beats Davenson Sanchez onto his left foot.
[2071.16 - 2073.16] P:1853.45 E:0.299180 |  Shoots straight into Yerimina,
[2073.16 - 2076.16] P:1774.31 E:0.251189 |  who came across the edge of the penalty area.
[2076.16 - 2078.16] P:1815.64 E:0.298168 |  And Columbia were able to clear it.
[2078.16 - 2081.16] P:1828.22 E:0.297237 |  Only partially away though, England back in possession.
[2081.16 - 2084.16] P:1959.67 E:0.269822 |  Maguire gets a touch, and then stones.
[2084.16 - 2088.16] P:2016.46 E:0.317794 |  Now Walker as well. This is good confidence, good touch from England here.
[2088.16 - 2090.16] P:1938.33 E:0.341245 |  And certainly the threat from Sterling, we saw there.
[2090.16 - 2094.16] P:1892.78 E:0.291383 |  Sterling with a flick, but he doesn't find Linde Gardic as it was deflected.
[2094.16 - 2097.16] P:1798.56 E:0.304595 |  And then Ashley Young might just be in to make the ball back,
[2097.16 - 2100.16] P:1917.62 E:0.326317 |  but as he did so, he actually lost possession.
[2100.16 - 2103.16] P:1855.31 E:0.296593 |  And Arias now finds Quadrado. Quintero's interested.
[2103.16 - 2105.16] P:1803.63 E:0.283356 |  Quadrado back onto his right foot.
[2105.16 - 2108.16] P:1819.62 E:0.311984 |  Quintero then reverse passes it straight out of play.
[2108.16 - 2111.16] P:1824.00 E:0.312058 |  We've played half an hour. It's Columbia nil, England nil.
[2111.16 - 2117.16] P:1861.38 E:0.282651 |  And let's just get a feeling from you and Terry Chris on how England has played so far.
[2117.16 - 2119.16] P:1939.06 E:0.328902 |  I think they've done well apart from...
[2119.16 - 2122.16] P:1982.14 E:0.330026 |  For me, Sterling's been on the ball in great areas.
[2122.16 - 2126.16] P:1991.34 E:0.320716 |  But if you give Quintero, if you look their way, he looks at their little passes.
[2126.16 - 2129.16] P:1938.80 E:0.304726 |  He slows up composure, he sees them balls.
[2129.16 - 2132.16] P:1908.09 E:0.317857 |  If he was playing for England now, England would be winning this game 2-3-0 in my eyes.
[2132.16 - 2136.16] P:1933.50 E:0.277207 |  Sterling gets into positions, gets to space, doesn't really set the rate,
[2136.16 - 2139.16] P:1764.64 E:0.268587 |  doesn't see the pass, and that's costing them so far.
[2139.16 - 2140.16] P:1717.08 E:0.293057 |  What about you, Terry?
[2140.16 - 2142.16] P:1899.33 E:0.263607 |  Yeah, it's just that fast tempo in the play.
[2142.16 - 2145.16] P:1878.03 E:0.324381 |  The players seem to be... It's too fast for the players.
[2145.16 - 2148.16] P:1775.53 E:0.347035 |  They haven't got their touch right, and consequently when Sterling's in good position,
[2148.16 - 2151.16] P:1783.81 E:0.357142 |  he's tried one or two little flicks and layoffs, and they haven't been right.
[2151.16 - 2155.16] P:1910.15 E:0.339390 |  And good chances or good possession in good areas has just gone to waste.
[2155.16 - 2159.16] P:1857.44 E:0.332618 |  But even dominating this game, you sort of think, well, a goal is coming.
[2159.16 - 2162.16] P:1748.70 E:0.325630 |  You just need to have a shot or good possession in their half,
[2162.16 - 2165.16] P:1950.93 E:0.305473 |  but I think it's going to come if they just keep playing this way.
[2165.16 - 2166.16] P:1940.05 E:0.327613 |  I think it will.
[2166.16 - 2170.16] P:1828.22 E:0.316985 |  Quadrado goes to a long ball over the top, but Maguire did well.
[2170.16 - 2174.16] P:1716.68 E:0.327522 |  And Maguire is able to shiver the ball out of play.
[2174.16 - 2177.16] P:1845.92 E:0.324406 |  Tashin Sanchez, Quadrado challenging Maguire.
[2177.16 - 2180.16] P:1681.51 E:0.289061 |  And Maguire is now complaining to the assistant there
[2180.16 - 2184.16] P:1705.98 E:0.267684 |  that there was a little bit of naughtiness, I think, from Quadrado.
[2184.16 - 2186.16] P:1855.47 E:0.336597 |  That was next to Terry.
[2186.16 - 2187.16] P:1868.96 E:0.290626 |  Terry, what did you see there?
[2187.16 - 2190.16] P:1892.46 E:0.336580 |  Yeah, Quadrado, I mean, Terry Maguire's looked at him,
[2190.16 - 2193.16] P:1889.73 E:0.362898 |  the ball's running out of play, he's never going to get the ball.
[2193.16 - 2195.16] P:1978.03 E:0.350610 |  And Quadrado's just tried to shoulder charge him.
[2195.16 - 2198.16] P:1981.29 E:0.336543 |  He's not shoulder charging, but on Terry Maguire's chest.
[2198.16 - 2202.16] P:1983.23 E:0.340741 |  Terry Maguire is sort of bounced off, and I mean, I know Ory just laughed in his face.
[2202.16 - 2205.16] P:1855.97 E:0.341175 |  If I was Terry Maguire, I wouldn't have got involved in all the history on it.
[2205.16 - 2208.16] P:1889.02 E:0.332535 |  He just laughed in his face and said, you know, finish yourself, sunshine, no chance.
[2208.16 - 2212.16] P:1782.86 E:0.316651 |  former England captain Terry Butcher, who's watching from behind the goal at that end.
[2212.16 - 2218.16] P:1705.38 E:0.293765 |  Just a few yards away from where Maguire and Quadrado jostled with one another.
[2218.16 - 2220.16] P:1718.28 E:0.340938 |  Ball headed forward towards Falco.
[2220.16 - 2225.16] P:1752.21 E:0.313405 |  Laserback, Kintero snatched at the shot when dragged at Wellway from just outside the deep.
[2225.16 - 2228.16] P:1548.83 E:0.339447 |  Not really coming to terms, I think, with Kintero's teams, haven't they?
[2228.16 - 2231.16] P:1503.41 E:0.307025 |  I mean, luckily enough that Falco's moving has not been very good
[2231.16 - 2235.16] P:1567.88 E:0.313038 |  because Kintero's had a lot of time and space, and he's got a wonderful left foot.
[2235.16 - 2238.16] P:1631.30 E:0.288774 |  But that team had a shot, which was...
[2239.16 - 2243.16] P:1846.11 E:0.350886 |  Oh, well, Mag, they're really weighed, so...
[2243.16 - 2246.16] P:1887.41 E:0.313500 |  But you've just got to keep an eye on him because he can make something happen.
[2246.16 - 2250.16] P:1855.52 E:0.323136 |  Yeah, Columbia nil, England nil, BBC Radio 5 Live.
[2250.16 - 2254.16] P:1721.79 E:0.297875 |  Of course, the World Cup Daily podcast will be out in the morning.
[2254.16 - 2259.16] P:1695.08 E:0.307160 |  Make sure that you download it when you wake up and you'll hear all of the news,
[2259.16 - 2262.16] P:1670.80 E:0.330311 |  we'll bring you all of the interviews, whatever happens here tonight.
[2262.16 - 2266.16] P:1778.53 E:0.297443 |  We'll be down in the tunnel talking to Gareth Southgate and a number of the England players,
[2266.16 - 2271.16] P:1883.08 E:0.294403 |  and you'll hear all of that as well as the usual array of World Cup guests
[2271.16 - 2275.16] P:1935.52 E:0.300235 |  on the 5 Live World Cup Daily podcast.
[2276.16 - 2281.16] P:1901.64 E:0.317606 |  Here's Maguire playing it through towards Sterling to Lingard.
[2281.16 - 2285.16] P:1861.29 E:0.308967 |  Lingard, to suede to his left, Deli Alley is there.
[2285.16 - 2292.16] P:1892.34 E:0.314457 |  Deli Alley, he's taken up some good positions, Chris, but not yet being able to make them count.
[2292.16 - 2297.16] P:1727.36 E:0.333714 |  He's Sterling to the Lingard, he just runs into the challenge and now it's brought away by Jefferson Lerner
[2297.16 - 2302.16] P:1773.02 E:0.283888 |  and Lerner, who's rather slowed this Colombian break,
[2302.16 - 2306.16] P:1744.85 E:0.309240 |  and is actually now running crossfield and rolling the ball across towards Arias.
[2306.16 - 2309.16] P:1799.23 E:0.269334 |  Quadrado says, give it to me, which he does.
[2309.16 - 2313.16] P:1608.01 E:0.272632 |  A little drop of the shoulder and then Quintero, who's another one, who's always one-sinking.
[2313.16 - 2317.16] P:1676.40 E:0.300886 |  He's often a run, but Deli Alley is able to step across and take the ball away from him.
[2317.16 - 2320.16] P:1836.52 E:0.335185 |  And then Ashley Young plays it back to the pitch, then he takes the pitch
[2320.16 - 2325.16] P:1868.50 E:0.312774 |  and then sweeps the ball away downfield, but only onto the chest of Carlos Sanchez.
[2325.16 - 2328.16] P:1729.03 E:0.306084 |  I tell you, he's doing a great job for the Barrios of 5.
[2328.16 - 2331.16] P:1602.32 E:0.305547 |  He's just sitting in front of 2 centre-horses and he becomes a centre-half.
[2331.16 - 2333.16] P:1705.94 E:0.302960 |  When Sterling goes high, he goes into the back 3.
[2333.16 - 2335.16] P:1728.34 E:0.312162 |  When Sterling goes short, he steps in.
[2335.16 - 2337.16] P:1692.91 E:0.330381 |  They've worked really hard at this system.
[2337.16 - 2339.16] P:1730.09 E:0.285867 |  You can see Clungard had to stop Lingard.
[2339.16 - 2345.16] P:1739.88 E:0.295895 |  He was highlighted, wasn't he, by Tim Vickery before the game.
[2345.16 - 2349.16] P:1638.65 E:0.308166 |  There have been reports of Tottenham interest in Vilmar Barrios,
[2349.16 - 2353.16] P:1720.01 E:0.306456 |  who is 24 years old, sturdy little figure.
[2353.16 - 2357.16] P:1665.32 E:0.314767 |  Here is Quintero, who's now often a run towards the edge of the penalty area.
[2357.16 - 2363.16] P:1741.40 E:0.299777 |  But John Stones is able to move across away from Falcao and clear it towards the halfway line.
[2363.16 - 2366.16] P:1619.98 E:0.313704 |  He does look isolated, doesn't he, Falcao?
[2366.16 - 2370.16] P:1766.76 E:0.268468 |  As the lone striker, Nil Nel.
[2370.16 - 2374.16] P:1671.69 E:0.297417 |  Quadrado, who's now central, plays the ball across.
[2374.16 - 2378.16] P:1570.30 E:0.290821 |  But Deli Alley got a block on that, still bounced to Sanchez though for Colombia.
[2378.16 - 2382.16] P:1616.28 E:0.275552 |  10 minutes to go to halftime, it's still Nil Nel.
[2382.16 - 2386.16] P:1656.93 E:0.287004 |  And even though the game has been played at some pace,
[2386.16 - 2393.16] P:1707.39 E:0.311384 |  we've really yet to see a clear-cut goal-scoring opportunity.
[2393.16 - 2399.16] P:1690.24 E:0.291543 |  Stones is able to volley the ball away, a sort of cushion volley towards Deli Alley.
[2399.16 - 2401.16] P:1683.61 E:0.295921 |  And now Maguire at the back.
[2401.16 - 2405.16] P:1810.26 E:0.309584 |  Maguire plays it back to Stones, who passes the ball between Falcao and Quadrado.
[2405.16 - 2407.16] P:1852.43 E:0.316900 |  Fortunately, Deli Alley was there.
[2407.16 - 2410.16] P:1838.21 E:0.306564 |  And now Harry Maguire steps out with it.
[2410.16 - 2414.16] P:1786.35 E:0.329359 |  Big Harry Maguire, 10 yards inside the Colombian half, uses Harry Kane.
[2414.16 - 2416.16] P:1878.60 E:0.280294 |  Kane squared a Henderson.
[2416.16 - 2420.16] P:1856.25 E:0.298491 |  Henderson now just rolls it invitingly across into the path of Lindgard.
[2420.16 - 2424.16] P:1758.74 E:0.317698 |  Back to Henderson, Henderson's ball over the top, evades everyone.
[2424.16 - 2427.16] P:1665.35 E:0.305854 |  Kane peeled away from Arias, but it's through for a goal kick.
[2427.16 - 2429.16] P:1629.61 E:0.326990 |  He's the first to have solved Jordan Henderson, haven't we?
[2429.16 - 2431.16] P:1433.53 E:0.327655 |  You've not really seen him in the game. That's all. He's never been on the ball.
[2431.16 - 2433.16] P:1504.70 E:0.263485 |  He's never had up for back three.
[2433.16 - 2436.16] P:1507.44 E:0.332423 |  Not really one of any tackles. That's the first time I've really seen him come into the game.
[2436.16 - 2441.16] P:1562.97 E:0.324523 |  Against Tunisia, Chris, if you remember, his influence increased as the game went on.
[2441.16 - 2443.16] P:1590.82 E:0.302867 |  And England needed him back.
[2443.16 - 2446.16] P:1521.89 E:0.322009 |  He's got a lot of responsibility playing for that three.
[2446.16 - 2448.16] P:1524.34 E:0.308154 |  There's a lot of movement.
[2448.16 - 2451.16] P:1581.69 E:0.312517 |  Bentero's dropping in behind him, Mareth from right of him.
[2451.16 - 2454.16] P:1517.46 E:0.319592 |  It's a difficult role to keep an eye on players who are dropping off.
[2454.16 - 2457.16] P:1605.06 E:0.283489 |  Columbia Nail, England Nail.
[2457.16 - 2459.16] P:1781.31 E:0.306467 |  And now a television screen.
[2459.16 - 2461.16] P:1529.42 E:0.338600 |  I think that was Lothar Matthias, wasn't it?
[2461.16 - 2464.16] P:1727.63 E:0.308528 |  We just saw a shutter. That's just to annoy you and Terry.
[2464.16 - 2467.16] P:1586.51 E:0.320020 |  He's here as a FIFA guest as well. Lothar Matthias.
[2467.16 - 2474.16] P:1792.92 E:0.277112 |  He's falk out for Columbia, but couldn't wriggle away from the England defence
[2474.16 - 2476.16] P:1792.62 E:0.293473 |  and walker who was able to play it back towards Pickford.
[2476.16 - 2479.16] P:1893.63 E:0.296749 |  John Stones has a look over his shoulder. There's no one there.
[2479.16 - 2483.16] P:1969.73 E:0.312725 |  So Stones is able to run the ball away towards the halfway line.
[2484.16 - 2490.16] P:1900.72 E:0.315154 |  Harry Kane again has dropped extremely deep to the extent that he's inside his own half.
[2490.16 - 2492.16] P:1919.53 E:0.268490 |  He's done that on a number of occasions.
[2492.16 - 2498.16] P:1900.75 E:0.300639 |  Kane actually plays almost a holding midfielder in the position that he is at the moment.
[2498.16 - 2500.16] P:1921.51 E:0.276021 |  Then passes the ball forward.
[2500.16 - 2505.16] P:1882.92 E:0.320418 |  Kane gradually makes ground through the middle while England have possession on the left.
[2505.16 - 2507.16] P:1900.31 E:0.311636 |  Sterling and Lingard.
[2507.16 - 2508.16] P:1886.94 E:0.314012 |  Now it is with Kane.
[2508.16 - 2512.16] P:1804.62 E:0.302122 |  Kane tried to slip the pass through towards Sterling's run and it was just cut out.
[2512.16 - 2514.16] P:1676.00 E:0.298115 |  But it comes back to Harry Kane, middle of the Columbia half.
[2514.16 - 2517.16] P:1817.37 E:0.296882 |  Deli Alley back to Kane. That's the top of understanding.
[2517.16 - 2520.16] P:1890.90 E:0.316631 |  Kane tries to take it on and then in dives low.
[2520.16 - 2524.16] P:1772.83 E:0.324656 |  My fouls, Kane, brings him down and it's a free kick in a good position
[2524.16 - 2528.16] P:1796.44 E:0.280946 |  that Deli Alley was thinking about taking quickly and Sanchez actually stepped in front of him.
[2528.16 - 2530.16] P:1592.95 E:0.297911 |  I think they're going to take the time now.
[2530.16 - 2533.16] P:1692.74 E:0.286104 |  He needed a shot on goal and Harry Kane, no, doesn't fancy it.
[2533.16 - 2535.16] P:1842.69 E:0.315197 |  So it's probably Trippia.
[2535.16 - 2538.16] P:1772.78 E:0.278419 |  It was a free kick. I've seen the benefit of a replay.
[2538.16 - 2540.16] P:1902.00 E:0.307004 |  Trippia's putting the ball down.
[2542.16 - 2544.16] P:1901.08 E:0.291590 |  Kane's OK.
[2544.16 - 2547.16] P:1817.61 E:0.295744 |  That's a massive issue with England, isn't it?
[2547.16 - 2552.16] P:1852.08 E:0.291253 |  What England do at this World Cup in these knockout stages?
[2552.16 - 2558.16] P:1836.10 E:0.297378 |  It feels that Harry Kane is absolutely pivotal to that.
[2558.16 - 2562.16] P:1819.70 E:0.313955 |  If he'd scored with that header, I mean that would have been so cold.
[2562.16 - 2567.16] P:1816.38 E:0.301576 |  He'd been able to get to that because he made so much ground to get in there and get his head to it.
[2567.16 - 2572.16] P:1869.94 E:0.282848 |  But anyway, he's won the free kick here and it's a free kick in a position left of centre.
[2572.16 - 2576.16] P:1935.74 E:0.278352 |  And given the angle, this will be 22-23 yards.
[2576.16 - 2581.16] P:1904.61 E:0.288417 |  And the referee Mark Geiger is, it seems to be struggling to get the ball back.
[2581.16 - 2583.16] P:1947.74 E:0.323175 |  It's a great position. I think the ball is that big as well.
[2583.16 - 2585.16] P:1934.72 E:0.332803 |  You can get it up and over from where you are.
[2585.16 - 2587.16] P:2028.30 E:0.335358 |  It's very possible.
[2587.16 - 2592.16] P:2004.62 E:0.336752 |  But for me, I'd whip it with a bit of pace and aim where the goal is standing.
[2592.16 - 2595.16] P:1996.95 E:0.325434 |  To the right of the wall, I wouldn't go over it.
[2595.16 - 2597.16] P:1989.98 E:0.345459 |  I'd go to where the goal is standing.
[2597.16 - 2600.16] P:1950.87 E:0.325974 |  Because the goalkeeper at that angle thinks you're going to go over the walls.
[2600.16 - 2604.16] P:1920.77 E:0.319168 |  I'm not sure what is the problem here with this.
[2604.16 - 2606.16] P:1747.54 E:0.325317 |  I mean now Lin Gard's got involved.
[2606.16 - 2607.16] P:1662.21 E:0.298811 |  Who's gone down?
[2607.16 - 2610.16] P:1705.07 E:0.315210 |  There's an England player, Jordan Henderson, who's down holding his head.
[2610.16 - 2612.16] P:1734.59 E:0.291936 |  Lin Gard's seen something.
[2612.16 - 2613.16] P:1657.24 E:0.302428 |  He's asking for a far.
[2613.16 - 2615.16] P:1872.64 E:0.264701 |  I said he's been nutted.
[2615.16 - 2619.16] P:1778.30 E:0.268953 |  And now actually we're going to see a shot of this.
[2619.16 - 2623.16] P:1771.13 E:0.290752 |  There's not a huge amount in that.
[2623.16 - 2625.16] P:1916.95 E:0.274538 |  No, I don't think.
[2625.16 - 2631.16] P:1783.48 E:0.298207 |  It's a Barrios who puts his head into the chest of Jordan Henderson and catches his jaw.
[2631.16 - 2633.16] P:1751.99 E:0.273263 |  And Henderson actually goes down.
[2633.16 - 2636.16] P:1714.72 E:0.299795 |  Henderson goes down holding his face.
[2636.16 - 2640.16] P:1877.64 E:0.319545 |  Are we surprised if there's anything happening to that?
[2640.16 - 2642.16] P:1695.84 E:0.352161 |  Actually, Jung's having a goal at the right time.
[2642.16 - 2646.16] P:1884.92 E:0.309094 |  It's actually one of those, I wonder, whether he's actually bitten his tongue, maybe, Jordan Henderson.
[2646.16 - 2649.16] P:1982.72 E:0.335129 |  Because it's one of those where you get a bash on the chin.
[2649.16 - 2654.16] P:1971.56 E:0.313003 |  They are checking though on the AR to see what they make of that.
[2654.16 - 2658.16] P:1919.43 E:0.313473 |  And the referee is going to call across Barrios.
[2658.16 - 2661.16] P:1786.43 E:0.326481 |  He's just going to have a yellow card.
[2661.16 - 2663.16] P:1912.86 E:0.322604 |  I mean, he shouldn't have done what he did.
[2663.16 - 2664.16] P:1756.61 E:0.331623 |  I don't know why there's a problem.
[2664.16 - 2667.16] P:1865.45 E:0.257873 |  If you're standing in the wall, you're allowed to.
[2667.16 - 2670.16] P:1828.95 E:0.262503 |  Still players are gathered around.
[2670.16 - 2675.16] P:1790.52 E:0.272110 |  And the referee is talking to Barrios, who incidentally will miss the next match.
[2675.16 - 2678.16] P:1653.93 E:0.289584 |  Because that's his second yellow card of the World Cup.
[2678.16 - 2683.16] P:1855.41 E:0.287460 |  Columbia get through to play Sweden, we won't be seeing Wilmar Barrios.
[2683.16 - 2685.16] P:1884.96 E:0.346718 |  Right call there, Chris?
[2685.16 - 2687.16] P:1854.72 E:0.294050 |  Yeah, he's got the replay.
[2687.16 - 2688.16] P:1696.97 E:0.302295 |  He shouldn't do what he did.
[2688.16 - 2689.16] P:1867.25 E:0.250897 |  You're only pushed and shoved.
[2689.16 - 2691.16] P:1592.68 E:0.294776 |  And why do you need to do anything like that?
[2691.16 - 2694.16] P:1574.58 E:0.285103 |  Because it wasn't, say, overtly aggressive.
[2694.16 - 2696.16] P:1679.35 E:0.260671 |  So yeah, he's giving me yellow.
[2696.16 - 2697.16] P:1758.53 E:0.321475 |  Pretty easy being a red, mate.
[2697.16 - 2701.16] P:1942.66 E:0.252798 |  But the thing is, the whole thing there was created.
[2701.16 - 2703.16] P:1783.20 E:0.301906 |  Because surely it's a simple process.
[2703.16 - 2707.16] P:1829.96 E:0.273769 |  The referee sprays his right leg, which he is now doing.
[2708.16 - 2713.16] P:1899.26 E:0.306495 |  And it's very simple to get the players behind the white line.
[2713.16 - 2715.16] P:1857.45 E:0.320435 |  I'm not sure what the issue was.
[2715.16 - 2718.16] P:1920.58 E:0.296210 |  England players are standing in front of the Colombian wall,
[2718.16 - 2720.16] P:1952.39 E:0.308921 |  Harry Maguire's around the back.
[2720.16 - 2724.16] P:1993.50 E:0.318223 |  Henderson has recovered from his bang on the chin.
[2724.16 - 2726.16] P:1958.44 E:0.341648 |  Trippie is still waiting.
[2726.16 - 2729.16] P:1983.68 E:0.336396 |  This is taking an absolute age.
[2729.16 - 2731.16] P:1915.66 E:0.354377 |  I see Quadrado is standing.
[2731.16 - 2733.16] P:1964.18 E:0.353790 |  Yeah, he's about four yards away.
[2733.16 - 2735.16] P:1849.52 E:0.325107 |  Trippie is going to take the free kick over the wall.
[2735.16 - 2736.16] P:1877.50 E:0.298815 |  But why did they go?
[2736.16 - 2738.16] P:1785.80 E:0.331683 |  To be honest, he's hit that well.
[2738.16 - 2740.16] P:1798.34 E:0.320863 |  But he's got to hit the target.
[2740.16 - 2742.16] P:1851.70 E:0.286722 |  He's got it up and over the wall quite easily.
[2742.16 - 2744.16] P:1833.05 E:0.270724 |  But he's a good what?
[2744.16 - 2746.16] P:1695.70 E:0.312724 |  He's good two, three yards away to the post.
[2746.16 - 2748.16] P:1840.27 E:0.270008 |  So he struck it really well.
[2748.16 - 2749.16] P:1737.62 E:0.244866 |  Got it, a target.
[2749.16 - 2751.16] P:1781.75 E:0.267761 |  41 minutes played.
[2751.16 - 2753.16] P:1619.15 E:0.271638 |  Colombian nil, England nil.
[2753.16 - 2755.16] P:1717.39 E:0.293814 |  BBC Radio 5 Live.
[2755.16 - 2757.16] P:1726.59 E:0.288139 |  And if you haven't heard, if you've been at work
[2757.16 - 2760.16] P:1729.09 E:0.264234 |  or out and about, Sweden won earlier.
[2760.16 - 2764.16] P:1699.70 E:0.273783 |  So England, if they win this, if they get through this,
[2764.16 - 2767.16] P:1657.93 E:0.268213 |  they'll say Sweden in the quarterfinal on Saturday,
[2767.16 - 2771.16] P:1697.25 E:0.269800 |  which will be three o'clock in the United Kingdom,
[2771.16 - 2774.16] P:1648.22 E:0.280539 |  three o'clock DST in Samara.
[2774.16 - 2777.16] P:1735.03 E:0.260756 |  We will have a 6-06 after the match tonight.
[2777.16 - 2781.16] P:1674.64 E:0.303558 |  Kelly Cates will be overseeing operations.
[2781.16 - 2784.16] P:1680.40 E:0.282333 |  I think you're involved, Chris, for Sutton as well,
[2784.16 - 2786.16] P:1683.68 E:0.281308 |  and Terry Butcher.
[2786.16 - 2788.16] P:1661.14 E:0.313168 |  And we'll let you know when the lines are open.
[2788.16 - 2792.16] P:1746.72 E:0.292997 |  The Colombian nil, England nil.
[2792.16 - 2796.16] P:1813.12 E:0.324617 |  I think it's entirely possible that it could deteriorate
[2796.16 - 2800.16] P:1749.78 E:0.330874 |  in the second half, because so much is at stake.
[2800.16 - 2802.16] P:1643.59 E:0.311120 |  And Colombia have taken this approach
[2802.16 - 2804.16] P:1783.13 E:0.310096 |  with the three central midfielders,
[2804.16 - 2807.16] P:1706.57 E:0.303602 |  relying a lot on Cuadrado and Quintero,
[2807.16 - 2809.16] P:1810.73 E:0.301751 |  and obviously Falcao up front through the middle,
[2809.16 - 2812.16] P:1877.37 E:0.333241 |  the 32-year-old playing in his first World Cup
[2812.16 - 2817.16] P:1857.68 E:0.292098 |  Radimal Falcao, who was actually named after the famous Falcao
[2817.16 - 2820.16] P:1773.67 E:0.282668 |  of 1982, because it's his middle name.
[2820.16 - 2823.16] P:1829.61 E:0.284524 |  His father gave him the name of Falcao.
[2823.16 - 2826.16] P:1801.36 E:0.340821 |  Here is Quintero. Quintero looks for Falcao,
[2826.16 - 2829.16] P:1736.79 E:0.319162 |  but it wasn't on as an option, so he uses Cuadrado,
[2829.16 - 2831.16] P:1661.66 E:0.285524 |  he wins his foot over the ball, and then Dele Alli
[2831.16 - 2833.16] P:1700.88 E:0.303239 |  is able to get a little touch in.
[2833.16 - 2835.16] P:1607.70 E:0.344817 |  That was one of the Champions League concentrations.
[2835.16 - 2837.16] P:1676.38 E:0.239415 |  We watched this week, Dele Alli and Cuadrado.
[2837.16 - 2839.16] P:1582.88 E:0.301295 |  Not feeling his thigh there again, is it?
[2839.16 - 2841.16] P:1635.97 E:0.239590 |  Dele Alli? No.
[2841.16 - 2844.16] P:1727.70 E:0.236985 |  He rolled off the pitch, and I think Garis Southgate
[2844.16 - 2847.16] P:1670.46 E:0.308018 |  suggested to the fourth official that there might have been
[2847.16 - 2849.16] P:1705.75 E:0.318641 |  a bang at Heggs there.
[2849.16 - 2853.16] P:1746.36 E:0.265994 |  Here's Dele Alli. It's 0-0, half-time approaching,
[2853.16 - 2858.16] P:1791.44 E:0.322129 |  and the ball is curled forward by Lehmann,
[2858.16 - 2860.16] P:1775.64 E:0.299271 |  but straight through to Jordan Pickford,
[2860.16 - 2863.16] P:1729.53 E:0.284760 |  who overarms it out to trip here on the far side.
[2863.16 - 2868.16] P:1913.29 E:0.306004 |  Back it comes towards Kyle Walker.
[2868.16 - 2871.16] P:1812.84 E:0.329607 |  Walker, but towards Sterling, who gets a little tug,
[2871.16 - 2873.16] P:1866.58 E:0.269996 |  but no free kick.
[2873.16 - 2875.16] P:1756.25 E:0.307733 |  Columbia with Quintero.
[2875.16 - 2878.16] P:1781.66 E:0.305376 |  Quintero whips the ball forward, but there's far too much on that,
[2878.16 - 2881.16] P:1787.19 E:0.292262 |  and it will run away through for a goal kick to Ingram.
[2881.16 - 2885.16] P:1719.86 E:0.308122 |  So really, really, just the one chance.
[2885.16 - 2887.16] P:1598.21 E:0.288896 |  Even that was a half chance.
[2887.16 - 2890.16] P:1758.37 E:0.280763 |  Yeah, Kane's chance, but Ingram being a better save,
[2890.16 - 2893.16] P:1691.55 E:0.281108 |  possession-wise, looked good temple about them.
[2893.16 - 2895.16] P:1833.87 E:0.263686 |  You can see how Columbia's game plan is.
[2895.16 - 2898.16] P:1800.86 E:0.275166 |  They're just basically playing for a chance to set piece
[2898.16 - 2900.16] P:1725.35 E:0.272295 |  of counter-attack.
[2900.16 - 2903.16] P:1692.45 E:0.318267 |  They're going all the way through it with shootout.
[2903.16 - 2905.16] P:1676.43 E:0.288060 |  You can see the way they've set up.
[2905.16 - 2907.16] P:1958.15 E:0.272244 |  They really are a bit scared of England.
[2907.16 - 2910.16] P:1752.12 E:0.297922 |  You can see how they've put so many yellow sheets behind the ball.
[2910.16 - 2913.16] P:1694.59 E:0.277978 |  Kane wins a head air against Galen-Sanchez.
[2913.16 - 2915.16] P:1751.96 E:0.304608 |  Then Kane gets it back. There's a little bit of space.
[2915.16 - 2917.16] P:1831.82 E:0.291802 |  He's going to have a shot, which he does,
[2917.16 - 2919.16] P:1824.46 E:0.343123 |  but it bounces away across the face of goal,
[2919.16 - 2922.16] P:1828.24 E:0.326254 |  and then Sterling and Mina have got involved in something.
[2922.16 - 2925.16] P:1786.05 E:0.324959 |  And there's a bit of a niggle certainly in this game now.
[2925.16 - 2927.16] P:1869.22 E:0.275198 |  There's no question about that.
[2927.16 - 2930.16] P:1812.27 E:0.280162 |  Sterling, Mina ended up on the ground.
[2930.16 - 2932.16] P:1826.23 E:0.277494 |  I mean, how Sterling ended up...
[2932.16 - 2934.16] P:1853.77 E:0.334611 |  Well, that was little and large.
[2934.16 - 2936.16] P:1686.78 E:0.309541 |  Flooring Mina is anyone's wonder.
[2936.16 - 2938.16] P:1621.50 E:0.310062 |  Well, it's got a hold of him. Look at that.
[2938.16 - 2940.16] P:1590.12 E:0.331233 |  Mina's got his arms around Sterling.
[2940.16 - 2942.16] P:1498.64 E:0.296408 |  Sterling's got his hands around...
[2942.16 - 2945.16] P:1698.71 E:0.225825 |  Sterling's got his hands around grabbing Mina short.
[2945.16 - 2947.16] P:1606.60 E:0.251029 |  And then...
[2947.16 - 2949.16] P:1744.82 E:0.273662 |  Well, what has he fallen over for?
[2949.16 - 2951.16] P:1742.29 E:0.303109 |  Watch Mina here.
[2951.16 - 2953.16] P:1814.16 E:0.296914 |  Well, if we can see it, we don't want to see this.
[2953.16 - 2955.16] P:1753.97 E:0.313686 |  And the replay, but...
[2955.16 - 2959.16] P:1883.32 E:0.307067 |  Trevor Burbeck after May Taiselhead comes to mind.
[2959.16 - 2961.16] P:1736.07 E:0.327986 |  Three minutes of added time.
[2961.16 - 2963.16] P:1787.57 E:0.278126 |  I suppose it's only three minutes.
[2963.16 - 2965.16] P:1799.30 E:0.308845 |  Yeah, true.
[2965.16 - 2968.16] P:1678.25 E:0.316296 |  It took three minutes to take that big kick.
[2968.16 - 2970.16] P:1659.08 E:0.280818 |  Columbia Nail, England Nail.
[2970.16 - 2972.16] P:1526.99 E:0.287802 |  Mark Chapman's here with us in the stadium.
[2972.16 - 2975.16] P:1578.69 E:0.276169 |  The Spartak Moscow stadium.
[2975.16 - 2977.16] P:1665.05 E:0.282828 |  And...
[2977.16 - 2984.16] P:1670.60 E:0.276664 |  Mark with us at half-time as Osbina takes this goal kick.
[2984.16 - 2986.16] P:1683.29 E:0.253537 |  Quadrado bounces off him.
[2986.16 - 2988.16] P:1585.52 E:0.280928 |  Cantero.
[2988.16 - 2990.16] P:1487.69 E:0.316393 |  Now Arias leaning back.
[2990.16 - 2992.16] P:1646.95 E:0.315315 |  Jung puts in the challenge.
[2992.16 - 2994.16] P:1693.59 E:0.306688 |  Arias gets up and then Deli Ali is able to block it out of play
[2994.16 - 2997.16] P:1864.75 E:0.317394 |  for throwing down the right flank.
[2997.16 - 3000.16] P:1765.36 E:0.353704 |  Arias is in no hurry here to recover the ball
[3000.16 - 3004.16] P:1879.75 E:0.291060 |  from in front of the England dugout.
[3004.16 - 3006.16] P:1827.30 E:0.347797 |  No-Hammes Red Riguez.
[3006.16 - 3008.16] P:1745.41 E:0.271718 |  If you haven't heard that news,
[3008.16 - 3012.16] P:1709.94 E:0.334436 |  the great Colombian star who is the top scorer of the World Cup
[3012.16 - 3014.16] P:1736.40 E:0.323817 |  scored that brilliant goal remember against Yuriyu Aguaio.
[3014.16 - 3016.16] P:1695.02 E:0.357959 |  You and I were watching it work the other day.
[3016.16 - 3018.16] P:1763.64 E:0.304554 |  Balls played 4-4, Columbia.
[3018.16 - 3020.16] P:1786.53 E:0.313220 |  Harry Maguire heads it away.
[3020.16 - 3023.16] P:1679.38 E:0.340007 |  Deli Ali feels that he was bundled over by Lerner.
[3023.16 - 3025.16] P:1736.89 E:0.328691 |  And now he's got a free kick.
[3025.16 - 3027.16] P:1779.07 E:0.299441 |  Falcao has got it on the right-hand side.
[3027.16 - 3029.16] P:1733.74 E:0.313781 |  Falcao trying to cross blocked by two defenders for England.
[3029.16 - 3031.16] P:1680.56 E:0.326520 |  Now Arias again.
[3031.16 - 3033.16] P:1909.11 E:0.323269 |  Arias to Quintero on his left foot.
[3033.16 - 3035.16] P:1848.23 E:0.337917 |  Shoots, but it's straight at Pickford.
[3035.16 - 3037.16] P:1733.25 E:0.325710 |  It dipped rather awkwardly.
[3037.16 - 3039.16] P:1827.86 E:0.300692 |  I think it might have taken a little deflection,
[3039.16 - 3041.16] P:1734.83 E:0.320519 |  but Pickford dealt with it securely.
[3041.16 - 3043.16] P:1767.24 E:0.335255 |  Can't give Quintaro that much space.
[3043.16 - 3045.16] P:1882.55 E:0.271355 |  He's got great left footwork,
[3045.16 - 3047.16] P:1786.93 E:0.338800 |  so already in his game and didn't probably hit it
[3047.16 - 3049.16] P:1957.66 E:0.325735 |  as well as he liked, but can't give him that space.
[3049.16 - 3051.16] P:1991.00 E:0.297045 |  That's probably one chance all.
[3051.16 - 3055.16] P:1959.27 E:0.292170 |  Chance from 22-23 yards out.
[3055.16 - 3057.16] P:1796.84 E:0.324878 |  In added time at the end of the first half.
[3057.16 - 3059.16] P:1919.69 E:0.306850 |  England perhaps one last attack of this first period.
[3059.16 - 3061.16] P:1959.10 E:0.266851 |  Nil-nil.
[3061.16 - 3063.16] P:1744.02 E:0.355631 |  Lingard out to the right. Then the ball comes in.
[3063.16 - 3065.16] P:1722.26 E:0.356315 |  Sterling was after it. It was clear to win.
[3065.16 - 3067.16] P:1918.52 E:0.269535 |  Then Lingard stretches for it.
[3067.16 - 3069.16] P:1857.56 E:0.345917 |  12-13 yards from goal,
[3069.16 - 3071.16] P:1864.80 E:0.278429 |  but can only shoot high over the cross.
[3071.16 - 3073.16] P:1778.70 E:0.268675 |  Wait, Paul in.
[3073.16 - 3075.16] P:1490.90 E:0.361738 |  Shippio again getting down that right.
[3075.16 - 3077.16] P:1774.51 E:0.299926 |  Really asking questions with that cross.
[3077.16 - 3079.16] P:1704.44 E:0.259862 |  Sterling was just coming in behind it.
[3079.16 - 3081.16] P:1783.27 E:0.272244 |  And then Giles was always high.
[3081.16 - 3083.16] P:1886.86 E:0.254635 |  Oh, is that the alley is injured?
[3083.16 - 3085.16] P:1847.12 E:0.305303 |  Alley has a problem.
[3085.16 - 3087.16] P:1941.85 E:0.282920 |  Yep.
[3087.16 - 3091.16] P:1944.02 E:0.325496 |  He did clash with Arias just a few moments ago
[3091.16 - 3093.16] P:1859.50 E:0.299176 |  when he rolled off the pitch.
[3093.16 - 3095.16] P:1871.47 E:0.294663 |  I think it was a way he fell, John.
[3095.16 - 3097.16] P:1872.99 E:0.321853 |  I'm not sure if he's tweaked his muscle,
[3097.16 - 3099.16] P:1902.40 E:0.300037 |  which he's had a problem with.
[3099.16 - 3101.16] P:1810.42 E:0.326079 |  He's on his back,
[3101.16 - 3105.16] P:1752.13 E:0.302300 |  and now he rolls over onto his knees.
[3105.16 - 3107.16] P:1729.47 E:0.211099 |  And he's got the...
[3107.16 - 3109.16] P:1766.96 E:0.289630 |  He's got the...
[3109.16 - 3111.16] P:1697.86 E:0.309849 |  And he always has this strapping on his legs.
[3111.16 - 3115.16] P:1725.20 E:0.268402 |  Doesn't be this sort of surgical cape.
[3115.16 - 3117.16] P:1697.38 E:0.295951 |  The deli alley,
[3117.16 - 3121.16] P:1825.63 E:0.273782 |  who obviously went off injured during the Tunisia game,
[3121.16 - 3125.16] P:1675.01 E:0.222084 |  had the problem, the luthi problem.
[3125.16 - 3129.16] P:1827.74 E:0.297259 |  And is now being very carefully looked at
[3129.16 - 3131.16] P:1780.22 E:0.268092 |  by the England medical people.
[3131.16 - 3135.16] P:1693.90 E:0.287570 |  Harry Kane is a concerned observer.
[3135.16 - 3137.16] P:1838.80 E:0.274132 |  It's actually a kick in, well...
[3137.16 - 3139.16] P:1948.47 E:0.302290 |  It's a kick...
[3139.16 - 3141.16] P:1756.66 E:0.328507 |  I thought when he fell over,
[3141.16 - 3143.16] P:1750.59 E:0.267300 |  and there he's been caught there,
[3143.16 - 3145.16] P:1615.70 E:0.283986 |  but when he fell in the other dugout,
[3145.16 - 3147.16] P:1699.35 E:0.273961 |  I thought he tweaked something there.
[3147.16 - 3149.16] P:1615.44 E:0.259549 |  He looked like he wasn't happy when he got up.
[3149.16 - 3151.16] P:1666.92 E:0.303027 |  I think it might have been caught in the other regions there.
[3151.16 - 3153.16] P:1885.03 E:0.227355 |  True, true.
[3153.16 - 3156.16] P:1736.57 E:0.277196 |  So maybe it's not too much of a worry,
[3156.16 - 3158.16] P:1727.33 E:0.256507 |  at least in the long term.
[3158.16 - 3161.16] P:1784.55 E:0.261809 |  Columbian nil, England nil.
[3161.16 - 3163.16] P:1757.38 E:0.286744 |  The alley alley is being led off the field,
[3163.16 - 3165.16] P:1714.79 E:0.232823 |  and he's OK.
[3165.16 - 3167.16] P:1588.43 E:0.324928 |  It's got to be halftime now anyway.
[3167.16 - 3169.16] P:1783.05 E:0.291796 |  Yeah, it is.
[3169.16 - 3172.16] P:1673.56 E:0.326761 |  Goal kick, Osbina to take it.
[3172.16 - 3175.16] P:1660.91 E:0.268499 |  I think this might be the last action of the first half.
[3175.16 - 3179.16] P:1708.89 E:0.257106 |  Alley still waiting to come back onto the field.
[3179.16 - 3182.16] P:1733.93 E:0.318669 |  Osbina takes an edge to take this goal kick,
[3182.16 - 3185.16] P:1642.24 E:0.257630 |  which he does now.
[3185.16 - 3188.16] P:1508.39 E:0.293911 |  Harry Maguire wins the header on the halfway line
[3188.16 - 3190.16] P:1647.16 E:0.249357 |  against Lerma,
[3190.16 - 3192.16] P:1762.39 E:0.277070 |  and Barrios nods it forward.
[3192.16 - 3195.16] P:1794.31 E:0.283634 |  Kintero stabs it up towards Falcao.
[3195.16 - 3198.16] P:1684.49 E:0.284816 |  Falcao to the far side to Mohica,
[3198.16 - 3202.16] P:1692.68 E:0.256388 |  where his weight wristbands on Mohica.
[3202.16 - 3205.16] P:1642.34 E:0.324041 |  Now Lerma allows it to run to Arias.
[3205.16 - 3207.16] P:1605.07 E:0.313906 |  Still we play on.
[3207.16 - 3209.16] P:1615.03 E:0.298907 |  Four minutes have had a time of being played.
[3209.16 - 3211.16] P:1692.42 E:0.289460 |  Quadrado plays it in, rather daintily cleared away
[3211.16 - 3213.16] P:1823.99 E:0.288729 |  by John Stones, who readjusted.
[3213.16 - 3216.16] P:1746.20 E:0.297045 |  And then Falcao coming from an offside position,
[3216.16 - 3218.16] P:1749.76 E:0.271158 |  and it's a free kick to England
[3218.16 - 3220.16] P:1745.68 E:0.313581 |  to go on penalty area.
[3220.16 - 3222.16] P:1771.52 E:0.334336 |  England's been a better save,
[3222.16 - 3224.16] P:1649.75 E:0.315871 |  but it's been quite scrappy.
[3224.16 - 3227.16] P:1712.17 E:0.321626 |  I could say it's becoming very cagey in the second half.
[3227.16 - 3229.16] P:1669.19 E:0.284120 |  It's going to slow down the pace.
[3229.16 - 3231.16] P:1773.88 E:0.256674 |  If you get a chance, you've got to take it.
[3231.16 - 3234.16] P:1861.02 E:0.266597 |  I hope everyone's nerves are up to it back home.
[3234.16 - 3238.16] P:1860.96 E:0.284868 |  England, and the knockout stages of a major tournament.
[3238.16 - 3241.16] P:1876.33 E:0.249534 |  We all know the penalty record,
[3241.16 - 3245.16] P:1960.28 E:0.278762 |  and we all know that they've won
[3245.16 - 3249.16] P:1884.29 E:0.297357 |  only two matches in knockout stages
[3249.16 - 3252.16] P:1821.28 E:0.328002 |  of the major tournament since Euro 96.
[3252.16 - 3255.16] P:1881.03 E:0.325274 |  And it's Nel Nel at halftime,
[3255.16 - 3257.16] P:1841.27 E:0.324086 |  and the players, the England players,
[3257.16 - 3259.16] P:1780.58 E:0.304901 |  trot towards this side of the field.
[3259.16 - 3262.16] P:1724.42 E:0.314667 |  Let off the field by John Stones and Jordan Henderson.
[3262.16 - 3264.16] P:1662.87 E:0.310568 |  The Colombian players are walking off the field.
[3264.16 - 3268.16] P:1759.13 E:0.281888 |  Ashley Young just has something to say to referee Geiger.
[3268.16 - 3270.16] P:1729.50 E:0.313594 |  But halftime, halftime here in Moscow,
[3270.16 - 3272.16] P:1587.76 E:0.270514 |  it is Colombia Nel, England Nel.
[3272.16 - 3274.16] P:1496.32 E:0.265827 |  Mark Chapman is here with us,
[3274.16 - 3277.16] P:1570.93 E:0.312949 |  and we'll have questions for Terry Butcher and Chris Waddle.
[3277.16 - 3280.16] P:1734.04 E:0.218170 |  He has England have not won a match
[3280.16 - 3284.16] P:1749.23 E:0.282758 |  in the knockout stages of a major tournament for 12 years.
[3284.16 - 3287.16] P:1626.55 E:0.230103 |  That's why Terry Butcher says it's a big a half ahead of them.
[3287.16 - 3289.16] P:1599.60 E:0.267874 |  Colombian Nel, England Nel.
[3289.16 - 3292.16] P:1755.01 E:0.296898 |  We've got Terry Butcher, we've got Chris Waddle here
[3292.16 - 3294.16] P:1800.39 E:0.257989 |  in the commentary position,
[3294.16 - 3297.16] P:1848.20 E:0.277266 |  so 139 England caps worth of experience
[3297.16 - 3299.16] P:1804.88 E:0.309158 |  in the Spartak Moscow Stadium with us.
[3299.16 - 3303.16] P:1816.11 E:0.242301 |  The second half begins, England kick off in the all red kit
[3303.16 - 3305.16] P:1757.67 E:0.282778 |  with the white numbers, white names.
[3305.16 - 3307.16] P:1570.90 E:0.260766 |  And Colombia, the yellow shirt,
[3307.16 - 3310.16] P:1813.93 E:0.294880 |  winning an immediate free kick, white shorts and white socks.
[3310.16 - 3312.16] P:1865.95 E:0.265083 |  No substitutions at halftime,
[3312.16 - 3315.16] P:1718.52 E:0.260695 |  so Colombia with Ospina, Arias Mina,
[3315.16 - 3318.16] P:1611.91 E:0.247600 |  Davinson Sanchez and Mohica in midfield.
[3318.16 - 3321.16] P:1699.01 E:0.300147 |  Barrios with Lerma and Sanchez either side of him,
[3321.16 - 3323.16] P:1508.54 E:0.272745 |  Carlos Sanchez, and then Juan Cuadrado,
[3323.16 - 3326.16] P:1580.82 E:0.285346 |  Juan Quintero and Radimal Falcao.
[3326.16 - 3328.16] P:1749.91 E:0.276731 |  And the England team, as it was,
[3328.16 - 3330.16] P:1829.33 E:0.297643 |  to start the World Cup against Tunisia,
[3330.16 - 3332.16] P:1749.32 E:0.292337 |  Pickfering goal, Walker, Stones and McGuire,
[3332.16 - 3334.16] P:1796.06 E:0.238460 |  Trippia and Jung, the wing backs,
[3334.16 - 3336.16] P:1629.73 E:0.289923 |  Henderson with Lingard and Ali either side,
[3336.16 - 3338.16] P:1773.61 E:0.247738 |  and then Sterling and captain
[3338.16 - 3341.16] P:1740.36 E:0.252581 |  and leading scorer at this World Cup, Harry Kane.
[3341.16 - 3343.16] P:1721.81 E:0.281275 |  So Colombian Nel, England Nel,
[3343.16 - 3347.16] P:1719.87 E:0.246376 |  the incident in the Colombian penalty area,
[3347.16 - 3350.16] P:1724.42 E:0.290747 |  involving Barrios' head and Jordan Henderson's chin,
[3350.16 - 3354.16] P:1834.11 E:0.276808 |  obviously creating a great deal of discussion at halftime,
[3354.16 - 3357.16] P:1793.19 E:0.240258 |  as Stones heads the ball over the halfway line,
[3357.16 - 3361.16] P:1788.15 E:0.241710 |  for England and it comes back for Colombia
[3361.16 - 3364.16] P:1773.17 E:0.231873 |  and it's worked out here to the left hand side to Mohica,
[3364.16 - 3366.16] P:1678.25 E:0.272650 |  but Trippia was in front of him
[3366.16 - 3368.16] P:1690.68 E:0.252335 |  and the ball deflects all the way back
[3368.16 - 3370.16] P:1696.07 E:0.237448 |  towards Davinson Sanchez.
[3370.16 - 3372.16] P:1746.14 E:0.265754 |  So Chris, you wanted to see a little bit more
[3372.16 - 3374.16] P:1683.36 E:0.295242 |  from Jordan Henderson, I sense.
[3374.16 - 3376.16] P:1478.36 E:0.294027 |  I don't think he's got on the ball enough,
[3376.16 - 3378.16] P:1560.06 E:0.283039 |  he's got, basically nobody around him.
[3378.16 - 3382.16] P:1799.68 E:0.248821 |  And he's screening obviously the centre forward Falcao,
[3382.16 - 3384.16] P:1643.54 E:0.288338 |  but he's not got on the ball enough,
[3384.16 - 3387.16] P:1687.07 E:0.256111 |  and not got into him enough and he's not got the ball,
[3387.16 - 3389.16] P:1624.41 E:0.289734 |  he's not looked for it enough for me,
[3389.16 - 3392.16] P:1758.60 E:0.270253 |  but I think Colombian have just come here to spoil.
[3392.16 - 3394.16] P:1758.14 E:0.231913 |  They think, you know, we'll spoil the game
[3394.16 - 3397.16] P:1430.94 E:0.282228 |  and we'll unsettle the game and not give them any other rhythm,
[3397.16 - 3399.16] P:1661.38 E:0.271095 |  and if it goes extra time, it goes extra time,
[3399.16 - 3401.16] P:1578.95 E:0.309966 |  after that we'll even take it then.
[3401.16 - 3403.16] P:1772.28 E:0.230110 |  Also ball from Falcao,
[3403.16 - 3408.16] P:1814.43 E:0.277068 |  just spooned it straight out of play as he tried to flick it to quadrado.
[3409.16 - 3412.16] P:1878.81 E:0.296722 |  They're sitting here, five-life comedy position,
[3412.16 - 3415.16] P:1846.05 E:0.300696 |  just to the left of the half-way line, quite low down,
[3415.16 - 3418.16] P:1919.65 E:0.284616 |  probably in the what, 20-25th roll back.
[3418.16 - 3421.16] P:1886.55 E:0.280347 |  So in the lower tier of the stadium,
[3421.16 - 3424.16] P:1909.04 E:0.252775 |  which is packed full of Colombians,
[3424.16 - 3428.16] P:1830.62 E:0.280642 |  the outnumber England supporters probably four to one.
[3429.16 - 3433.16] P:1794.75 E:0.282436 |  Stones bringing the ball out from the back, Falcao is after him.
[3433.16 - 3436.16] P:1818.72 E:0.279397 |  So Stones rolls it across to Maguayah,
[3436.16 - 3441.16] P:1878.90 E:0.259774 |  and now the other central defender, Kyle Walker, receives it, Trippia,
[3441.16 - 3445.16] P:1859.53 E:0.271181 |  two Stones again, and then Trippia has to stretch
[3445.16 - 3448.16] P:1753.96 E:0.289358 |  and play it back to Walker, who allows it to run back towards the edge
[3448.16 - 3450.16] P:1753.04 E:0.279340 |  of the penalty area.
[3450.16 - 3454.16] P:1753.16 E:0.277723 |  Colombian nil, England nil, and the lines are open already for 606.
[3454.16 - 3457.16] P:1805.55 E:0.268414 |  08, 08, 5, 9, 09, 6, 9, 3.
[3457.16 - 3461.16] P:1783.74 E:0.288558 |  Kelly Cage will be hosting in our studio down at Red Square.
[3461.16 - 3464.16] P:1774.17 E:0.274314 |  Chris Waddle and Terry Butcher will be involved.
[3464.16 - 3469.16] P:1824.71 E:0.271389 |  Chris Sutton as well in Rostov as England play the ball forward towards Sterling,
[3469.16 - 3472.16] P:1700.96 E:0.227405 |  but Davidson Sanchez step forward,
[3472.16 - 3475.16] P:1718.66 E:0.299192 |  and the ball was eventually deflected out of play,
[3475.16 - 3478.16] P:1751.88 E:0.289485 |  near the half-way line for a throwing to Colombia.
[3478.16 - 3484.16] P:1799.64 E:0.273332 |  So nil nil and Mohica will keep this just in front of where
[3484.16 - 3489.16] P:1753.14 E:0.305423 |  Colombia's 68-year-old manager is standing in his dark blue suit
[3489.16 - 3494.16] P:1743.69 E:0.273894 |  and his rather stylish, comfortable shoes with their white soles.
[3494.16 - 3498.16] P:1647.36 E:0.281747 |  He has the look of a sort of Bill Nye-type figure, doesn't he, Peckerman,
[3498.16 - 3501.16] P:1640.15 E:0.352511 |  as it's headed away near the edge of the area by Walker
[3501.16 - 3504.16] P:1785.23 E:0.294055 |  and the free kick given England's way for a foul.
[3504.16 - 3507.16] P:1802.96 E:0.304464 |  The Stones was going to take quickly, but there's certainly, you know,
[3507.16 - 3511.16] P:1700.95 E:0.316250 |  one thing we have to watch here, and this is a real test, Chris, for referee Geiger,
[3511.16 - 3513.16] P:1696.06 E:0.308632 |  is that there is an awful lot going on in this game,
[3513.16 - 3515.16] P:1800.59 E:0.304702 |  and there's a bit of feeling here.
[3515.16 - 3516.16] P:1658.25 E:0.312019 |  The stakes are very high.
[3516.16 - 3519.16] P:1728.65 E:0.300792 |  There has been niggle, whatever happened with Raheem Sterling
[3519.16 - 3521.16] P:1598.52 E:0.316376 |  as he was leaving the pitch at the end of the first half.
[3521.16 - 3526.16] P:1849.74 E:0.286716 |  Stones and Sterling and Mina have had a couple of coming together.
[3526.16 - 3531.16] P:1791.64 E:0.267795 |  Jung and Arias are another combination who've been at one another,
[3531.16 - 3535.16] P:1725.89 E:0.265858 |  as Davidson Sanchez heads the ball into center field to Cuadrado,
[3535.16 - 3537.16] P:1696.93 E:0.265315 |  and it comes back into central defence,
[3537.16 - 3541.16] P:1679.10 E:0.281414 |  where Barrios is actually stationed in between the two central defenders.
[3541.16 - 3543.16] P:1723.67 E:0.270957 |  Now it's up to the right-hand side.
[3543.16 - 3546.16] P:1833.34 E:0.320599 |  You can tell that's an uncompromising challenge from Harry Maguire
[3546.16 - 3549.16] P:1827.17 E:0.285674 |  on the half-way line, which is not given as a free kick.
[3549.16 - 3552.16] P:1795.06 E:0.262322 |  I've got to say, it's starting off scrappy, isn't it?
[3552.16 - 3556.16] P:1886.24 E:0.294700 |  It's nothing put together, and they're going to use all the tricks in the book,
[3556.16 - 3558.16] P:1902.10 E:0.304380 |  Columbia, there's no doubt about that.
[3558.16 - 3561.16] P:1908.50 E:0.300117 |  They know a few, so they're unsettling here, England,
[3561.16 - 3563.16] P:1864.33 E:0.284501 |  when they get into a little bit of rhythm,
[3563.16 - 3566.16] P:1977.86 E:0.263495 |  and they're quite happy to foul, stop the game,
[3566.16 - 3568.16] P:1926.08 E:0.316417 |  and really get on to the referee,
[3568.16 - 3570.16] P:1981.16 E:0.290717 |  and in a minute it's really scrappy football.
[3570.16 - 3573.16] P:1950.15 E:0.278353 |  Over and played between the two penalty areas.
[3573.16 - 3575.16] P:1943.71 E:0.279797 |  Lindgard to Stones.
[3575.16 - 3578.16] P:1900.90 E:0.332623 |  Now Harry Kane. Oh, Lindgard finds a little bit of space.
[3578.16 - 3580.16] P:1863.72 E:0.315917 |  Lindgard slips it square towards Deli Alley,
[3580.16 - 3583.16] P:1813.77 E:0.321223 |  whose challenge went down quite theatrically there,
[3583.16 - 3586.16] P:1816.30 E:0.306725 |  as Davidson Sanchez, his clubmate, put the challenge in.
[3586.16 - 3588.16] P:1727.97 E:0.306311 |  I don't think it was a free kick, but it wasn't given.
[3588.16 - 3592.16] P:1814.27 E:0.255132 |  Here's Falcao. Falcao now for Cuadrado.
[3592.16 - 3598.16] P:1816.46 E:0.255705 |  Mojica is available, but Harry Kane is back there, battling deep inside his own half,
[3598.16 - 3602.16] P:1758.47 E:0.254417 |  and Cuadrado keeps possession and plays it back into the centre circle.
[3602.16 - 3607.16] P:1792.55 E:0.254821 |  Mina. Now Lerma.
[3607.16 - 3611.16] P:1790.96 E:0.270462 |  Arias slips it infield towards Barrios.
[3611.16 - 3614.16] P:1836.84 E:0.276109 |  Barrios over hits the ball through.
[3614.16 - 3618.16] P:1822.06 E:0.290748 |  Falcao went one way, the ball just ran through towards Jordan Pickford.
[3618.16 - 3623.16] P:1814.20 E:0.244032 |  So Columbia nil, England nil, and already this match,
[3623.16 - 3627.16] P:1887.80 E:0.284684 |  which has thrown up very few goal-scoring opportunities,
[3627.16 - 3633.16] P:1798.28 E:0.273149 |  has the feel of one that may well be heading beyond the 90 minutes.
[3633.16 - 3636.16] P:1863.17 E:0.268016 |  But we'll see. Here's Henderson.
[3636.16 - 3641.16] P:1908.18 E:0.274626 |  Stones makes a run forward. Henderson goes back to Walker,
[3641.16 - 3643.16] P:1876.97 E:0.329829 |  who has no other option but to go back to pick.
[3643.16 - 3647.16] P:1844.58 E:0.278597 |  No, it's getting... England's coming there, falling into the trap of Columbia.
[3647.16 - 3650.16] P:1873.71 E:0.279284 |  Columbia's quite happy the weather game's panning out the minute.
[3650.16 - 3653.16] P:1782.25 E:0.299761 |  It suits them, but England's got to get back and move on the ball quicker.
[3653.16 - 3657.16] P:1848.71 E:0.285455 |  Bit more options, bit more of the ball from sight to sight, a lot more.
[3657.16 - 3661.16] P:1835.96 E:0.266058 |  A little bit of something between Sterling and Lerma,
[3661.16 - 3664.16] P:1778.63 E:0.278358 |  just off the ball when they challenge for it together.
[3664.16 - 3668.16] P:1703.96 E:0.284094 |  Eventually he bounces out a play for a throw in to England down the far side,
[3668.16 - 3673.16] P:1764.56 E:0.298813 |  that Deli Alley is going to take. Deli Alley actually will leave it for Ashley Young,
[3673.16 - 3678.16] P:1874.58 E:0.266585 |  who's arrived at the touchline. Ashley Young, oldest man in this England squad.
[3678.16 - 3683.16] P:1867.71 E:0.290576 |  There's a young England team. Young gets it back now to Lingard.
[3683.16 - 3687.16] P:1860.70 E:0.278858 |  Back to Ashley Young again, winning his 37th cap tonight.
[3687.16 - 3691.16] P:1689.08 E:0.286359 |  Ashley Young, remember he was one of the men who missed the penalty
[3691.16 - 3695.16] P:1821.26 E:0.313268 |  in the shootout in which England went out of Euro 2012.
[3695.16 - 3700.16] P:1871.67 E:0.314888 |  Now Harry Kane is challenged illegally by Arias,
[3700.16 - 3703.16] P:1827.82 E:0.290738 |  who has shown a yellow card for that challenge on Harry Kane.
[3703.16 - 3706.16] P:1813.35 E:0.267481 |  From where we are, we've just seen him replay there.
[3706.16 - 3710.16] P:1729.04 E:0.303300 |  Harry Kane gets it first, and he barges him in the back, knocks him to the floor,
[3710.16 - 3713.16] P:1772.30 E:0.275246 |  so the referee got that right. Harry has much smaller man,
[3713.16 - 3718.16] P:1708.75 E:0.258606 |  leapt for it with his elbow into the back, into the small of Harry Kane's back.
[3718.16 - 3725.16] P:1737.66 E:0.255137 |  So it's a first chance for England to swing a free kick into the Colombian penalty area
[3725.16 - 3727.16] P:1585.75 E:0.272735 |  in this second half.
[3728.16 - 3735.16] P:1870.45 E:0.271476 |  Ashley Young, just getting his sock sorted out, pulling him up over his knees.
[3735.16 - 3741.16] P:1972.94 E:0.309041 |  And Harry Kane, taking up a position right at the back post.
[3741.16 - 3745.16] P:1940.75 E:0.333836 |  Harry Maguire is there as well. Dali Ali too.
[3745.16 - 3749.16] P:1959.23 E:0.324033 |  The referee gives the signal, played in by Young.
[3749.16 - 3753.16] P:1843.77 E:0.302109 |  Harry Maguire, close to getting his head to it, the Davinson Sanchez.
[3753.16 - 3756.16] P:1668.84 E:0.268243 |  Well defended again by the Tottenham Central defender,
[3756.16 - 3759.16] P:1742.76 E:0.282017 |  just got there to glance it through for a corner.
[3759.16 - 3761.16] P:1943.81 E:0.274566 |  Yeah, great ball in.
[3761.16 - 3764.16] P:1976.14 E:0.356089 |  It's a brilliant header there.
[3764.16 - 3767.16] P:1939.98 E:0.329408 |  It just spotted the danger. Just in time as well.
[3767.16 - 3769.16] P:1947.87 E:0.300299 |  Harry Maguire is just about ahead.
[3769.16 - 3771.16] P:1912.97 E:0.336030 |  Corner, that's a well-got.
[3771.16 - 3773.16] P:1972.85 E:0.282850 |  This is ridiculous.
[3773.16 - 3775.16] P:1905.26 E:0.304188 |  This is absolutely ridiculous.
[3775.16 - 3780.16] P:1928.35 E:0.292103 |  Particularly when you consider that we now have the possibility of the video assistant referee.
[3780.16 - 3784.16] P:1982.24 E:0.284736 |  Four England players have almost information.
[3784.16 - 3788.16] P:1930.16 E:0.265608 |  Kane, Maguire, Stones and Henderson are...
[3788.16 - 3791.16] P:1981.29 E:0.271260 |  Are they going to do the conga, do you think?
[3791.16 - 3796.16] P:1972.30 E:0.309776 |  It's a corner, Trippie takes it towards the back post.
[3796.16 - 3798.16] P:1920.54 E:0.327759 |  It's headed back across the repeals.
[3798.16 - 3800.16] P:1791.95 E:0.348219 |  The repeals, has that been given as a penalty?
[3800.16 - 3802.16] P:1908.46 E:0.288983 |  And a yellow.
[3802.16 - 3804.16] P:1875.18 E:0.342502 |  Yes it is, it's a penalty to England.
[3804.16 - 3808.16] P:1758.02 E:0.311182 |  I think it's Harry Kane who ended up on the ground, in amongst a crowd of players.
[3808.16 - 3812.16] P:1843.90 E:0.294552 |  A yellow card has been shown and England have been awarded a penalty.
[3812.16 - 3814.16] P:1885.93 E:0.262031 |  Although there's still some anger here.
[3814.16 - 3818.16] P:1733.33 E:0.286056 |  The Colombian players are surrounding referee Guy Gagher.
[3818.16 - 3822.16] P:1788.73 E:0.270305 |  But Harry Kane was right in front of the referee.
[3822.16 - 3824.16] P:1778.71 E:0.296926 |  Look at that Sanchez.
[3824.16 - 3828.16] P:1699.21 E:0.290059 |  Carlos Sanchez, hold him, it was almost under the referee's nose.
[3828.16 - 3830.16] P:1674.44 E:0.254903 |  He could not miss it.
[3830.16 - 3832.16] P:1662.27 E:0.230722 |  And the penalty's been given.
[3832.16 - 3835.16] P:1827.26 E:0.200822 |  VAR has checked it.
[3835.16 - 3838.16] P:1869.23 E:0.200667 |  The check is over.
[3838.16 - 3841.16] P:1779.75 E:0.240309 |  Still the players are protesting.
[3841.16 - 3844.16] P:1761.65 E:0.276580 |  I don't know what the right contest is about.
[3844.16 - 3847.16] P:1824.01 E:0.255897 |  Carlos Sanchez has been yellow carded.
[3847.16 - 3850.16] P:1759.84 E:0.285026 |  And it is going to be a penalty to England.
[3850.16 - 3853.16] P:1720.73 E:0.288004 |  Harry Kane will have a chance, he's got the ball in his hands.
[3853.16 - 3856.16] P:1737.90 E:0.308410 |  He will have a chance here to score his third penalty of this World Cup.
[3856.16 - 3860.16] P:1871.86 E:0.216488 |  And to score his sixth goal.
[3860.16 - 3866.16] P:1764.08 E:0.268597 |  And still the referee is having to face protests from Radamel Falcao.
[3866.16 - 3869.16] P:1810.21 E:0.233650 |  Ospina the goalkeeper is there.
[3869.16 - 3874.16] P:1784.28 E:0.258096 |  And also the man who conceded the penalty, Carlos Sanchez.
[3874.16 - 3876.16] P:1622.24 E:0.301479 |  This all happened at Terry Butcher's end of the ground.
[3876.16 - 3878.16] P:1920.99 E:0.256498 |  What did you see Terry?
[3878.16 - 3882.16] P:1881.02 E:0.318900 |  Well I saw something, I don't see something, I saw it like...
[3882.16 - 3886.16] P:1931.59 E:0.325479 |  I think it was Sanchez or...
[3886.16 - 3888.16] P:1814.02 E:0.342999 |  Not too sure it was Mark and Harry Kane.
[3888.16 - 3892.16] P:1814.52 E:0.314572 |  Yeah, he picked him up at the back and he was having a wheelbarrow race.
[3892.16 - 3896.16] P:1824.67 E:0.331280 |  We have at the parents' sports meeting, he had a wheelbarrow race with Harry Kane.
[3896.16 - 3898.16] P:1842.77 E:0.327414 |  Dumped him on the floor, right in front of the referee.
[3898.16 - 3903.16] P:1888.85 E:0.315776 |  The referee was watching somewhere else and then saw this happen on its own in a space.
[3903.16 - 3905.16] P:1809.13 E:0.318624 |  It's an obvious penalty.
[3905.16 - 3907.16] P:1923.05 E:0.307876 |  There's a quick VAR check, it was very quick.
[3907.16 - 3909.16] P:1846.63 E:0.332504 |  There's a penalty.
[3909.16 - 3913.16] P:1807.01 E:0.313514 |  And over the penalty spot, one or two of them are just roughing up the penalty spot with their studs.
[3913.16 - 3915.16] P:1882.28 E:0.305339 |  I mean this is a disgrace.
[3915.16 - 3917.16] P:1954.56 E:0.272685 |  An absolute disgrace.
[3917.16 - 3923.16] P:1830.15 E:0.326545 |  That is awful and now they can't accept the fact that someone has manhandled England's captain on the floor.
[3923.16 - 3926.16] P:1862.05 E:0.333933 |  It's a penalty. Get away from the referee.
[3926.16 - 3930.16] P:2012.04 E:0.348208 |  They're also trying to get at Harry Kane as well.
[3930.16 - 3936.16] P:2037.50 E:0.355580 |  He was trying to compose himself and the Colombian players, several of them went to Harry Kane who just wandered away.
[3936.16 - 3939.16] P:1969.90 E:0.242601 |  He's booked Jordan Henderson.
[3939.16 - 3941.16] P:1892.54 E:0.329408 |  Jordan Henderson's been booked.
[3941.16 - 3943.16] P:1867.02 E:0.286398 |  Yeah, he's just done booked him, look.
[3944.16 - 3953.16] P:1732.38 E:0.316531 |  Well, we're seeing pictures of Jordan Henderson who, one of the Colombian players was buzzing around behind him.
[3953.16 - 3958.16] P:1679.46 E:0.317140 |  Jordan Henderson just sort of moved his head back into it.
[3958.16 - 3960.16] P:1504.94 E:0.316930 |  And that's why he's been yellow carded.
[3960.16 - 3963.16] P:1704.74 E:0.314572 |  Yep, but the referee got no control over the game.
[3963.16 - 3965.16] P:1722.89 E:0.302235 |  It's only going to get worse.
[3965.16 - 3968.16] P:1874.66 E:0.315372 |  The referee needed that to take a grip because this is ridiculous.
[3968.16 - 3973.16] P:1951.64 E:0.334171 |  For it to take this long to calm all of that down and get the penalty taken.
[3973.16 - 3976.16] P:2004.24 E:0.331691 |  It's ludicrous really.
[3976.16 - 3981.16] P:1957.51 E:0.318717 |  And we're still seeing David Ospina not getting back into position.
[3981.16 - 3984.16] P:1941.95 E:0.305131 |  But here we are then. It's nil nil.
[3984.16 - 3987.16] P:1911.22 E:0.313467 |  England have a penalty and Harry Kane is going to take it.
[3987.16 - 3993.16] P:1968.17 E:0.306470 |  Having already scored two brilliant penalties against Panama which he took right-frooded,
[3993.16 - 3995.16] P:1947.84 E:0.309066 |  high to the goalkeepers right.
[3995.16 - 3998.16] P:1898.80 E:0.307619 |  They were struck so well they were unstoppable.
[3998.16 - 4000.16] P:1915.43 E:0.311598 |  Will he go the same way again?
[4000.16 - 4004.16] P:1945.52 E:0.315747 |  He told me he's been practicing and practicing and practicing penalties.
[4004.16 - 4008.16] P:1972.73 E:0.327871 |  So here he is to give England the lead in the last 16.
[4008.16 - 4011.16] P:1854.86 E:0.361457 |  He has gone down the middle and he scored.
[4011.16 - 4018.16] P:1834.11 E:0.333754 |  It's 1-0 to England and it's captain Harry Kane with his sixth goal at this World Cup.
[4018.16 - 4023.16] P:1831.24 E:0.317240 |  And that matches Gary Linnicka's total at Mexico 86.
[4023.16 - 4028.16] P:1852.36 E:0.285110 |  But it also gives England a valuable and crucial lead.
[4028.16 - 4031.16] P:1872.50 E:0.323701 |  They are ahead in this round of 16 tie.
[4031.16 - 4033.16] P:1524.91 E:0.309729 |  1-0 against Colombia.
[4033.16 - 4036.16] P:1520.62 E:0.318263 |  I don't know if the referee is having a very good game but he got that decision right.
[4036.16 - 4039.16] P:1616.24 E:0.291948 |  It was a pen and Harry Kane goes down in the middle.
[4039.16 - 4042.16] P:1695.94 E:0.302942 |  Ospina has obviously saw him hit two to the goal.
[4042.16 - 4046.16] P:1688.69 E:0.281948 |  He's dived early and he's just placed it straight down the middle.
[4046.16 - 4048.16] P:1424.40 E:0.338862 |  He didn't just place on it as well.
[4048.16 - 4051.16] P:1585.51 E:0.257458 |  He didn't blast it, save four, goalkeeper has gone to the ground.
[4051.16 - 4053.16] P:1587.25 E:0.296410 |  And England deserve it.
[4053.16 - 4057.16] P:1596.70 E:0.266940 |  It's been a scrappy match but the referee for me is spoiling the game.
[4057.16 - 4060.16] P:1641.02 E:0.299918 |  Still the Colombians are talking to the referee.
[4060.16 - 4062.16] P:1663.34 E:0.277046 |  Still they're on at him.
[4062.16 - 4066.16] P:1789.35 E:0.287123 |  And now finally the match gets underway again.
[4066.16 - 4071.16] P:1859.30 E:0.296595 |  Terry just gives another thought on what just happened there.
[4071.16 - 4073.16] P:1811.21 E:0.331291 |  Obviously we talked about the penalty.
[4073.16 - 4076.16] P:1913.86 E:0.322127 |  But the referee for me was saying that he was playing with him.
[4076.16 - 4079.16] P:1954.75 E:0.340158 |  It was absolutely a picture of concentration.
[4079.16 - 4084.16] P:1906.39 E:0.364357 |  He just looked at the ball and he just glanced up at the way Ospina was.
[4084.16 - 4087.16] P:1903.16 E:0.309642 |  Now a bit of bother here in the centre circle.
[4087.16 - 4092.16] P:1758.19 E:0.303728 |  John Stones, Radamel Falcao has gone down clutching his face.
[4092.16 - 4096.16] P:1638.69 E:0.277496 |  The two of them tangled as the ball went over the top of them.
[4096.16 - 4099.16] P:1605.96 E:0.292706 |  Falcao is down still.
[4099.16 - 4101.16] P:1739.88 E:0.303218 |  He looked at John Stones.
[4101.16 - 4104.16] P:1805.27 E:0.270652 |  He's been together challenging for the ball.
[4104.16 - 4109.16] P:1827.56 E:0.290113 |  And Stones sort of pulled his foot out from where it was.
[4109.16 - 4111.16] P:1738.53 E:0.329542 |  And catches the side of Falcao's head.
[4111.16 - 4113.16] P:1539.58 E:0.335460 |  We can see that on the replay here.
[4113.16 - 4115.16] P:1655.12 E:0.318933 |  Falcao out of his leg and he would have let him go.
[4115.16 - 4118.16] P:1655.43 E:0.319373 |  So he kicks it out, throws it out but it catches him on the head.
[4118.16 - 4119.16] P:1760.88 E:0.268982 |  But he's up.
[4119.16 - 4121.16] P:1728.53 E:0.301487 |  More from Terry Butcher in a moment.
[4121.16 - 4122.16] P:1648.54 E:0.295005 |  Free kick taken quickly.
[4122.16 - 4125.16] P:1753.75 E:0.325699 |  Cantero hits a shot, it rattles across the edge of the England penalty area.
[4125.16 - 4128.16] P:1563.83 E:0.288955 |  Davinson Sanchez has been watched by Harry Maguire.
[4128.16 - 4130.16] P:1489.14 E:0.308082 |  He's been able to work it back into the penalty area.
[4130.16 - 4134.16] P:1609.10 E:0.298406 |  But Henderson clears the way downfield where it will be kept in
[4134.16 - 4137.16] P:1561.98 E:0.280581 |  and played back into central defence to Barrios.
[4137.16 - 4142.16] P:1591.86 E:0.290920 |  And now forward towards Carlos Sanchez who was the Colombian player
[4142.16 - 4144.16] P:1490.14 E:0.321771 |  booked in the conceding of the England penalty.
[4144.16 - 4148.16] P:1750.39 E:0.305806 |  Sterling now gets the ball down, plays it just behind Lingard.
[4148.16 - 4151.16] P:1655.75 E:0.288711 |  And so Carlos Sanchez can readjust and play it out.
[4151.16 - 4153.16] P:1737.39 E:0.303064 |  Here to the left-hand side to Mohica.
[4153.16 - 4154.16] P:1655.95 E:0.288067 |  Chris?
[4154.16 - 4158.16] P:1697.69 E:0.307227 |  Yeah, I'm just thinking England's got to keep their mains on the game.
[4158.16 - 4162.16] P:1753.67 E:0.330981 |  Don't get involved with their diving, the dramatic survival here,
[4162.16 - 4165.16] P:1532.44 E:0.309935 |  the Colombians here, they're niggling you, they're frustrating you.
[4165.16 - 4168.16] P:1480.61 E:0.312079 |  Don't buy it, play your football and the winners are getting quite comfortable.
[4168.16 - 4171.16] P:1535.03 E:0.281557 |  You don't want to get involved and they're going to bring on Falcao.
[4171.16 - 4174.16] P:1615.78 E:0.327581 |  Let's just bring in Terry again from down at pitch level.
[4174.16 - 4175.16] P:1799.86 E:0.340281 |  Terry Butcher.
[4175.16 - 4179.16] P:1836.13 E:0.341322 |  Yeah, I mean Harry Kane picked this spot and it was unbelievable.
[4179.16 - 4181.16] P:1911.37 E:0.308935 |  Just really focused on what he had to do.
[4181.16 - 4183.16] P:1828.47 E:0.333582 |  It was always going to end up in the back of the net.
[4183.16 - 4186.16] P:1842.92 E:0.324253 |  And the whole of the England bench up there, virtually on the edge of the pitch,
[4186.16 - 4188.16] P:1776.42 E:0.330776 |  to celebrate as well, that's what you want to see.
[4188.16 - 4193.16] P:1723.39 E:0.299373 |  He's going to bring off Jose Pacquem and one of his three central midfielders.
[4193.16 - 4197.16] P:1564.66 E:0.311180 |  Lermer, I can see his red number 16 is on the board already.
[4197.16 - 4200.16] P:1583.51 E:0.325967 |  So in this position, he has to do that, 1-0 down.
[4200.16 - 4203.16] P:1671.60 E:0.286535 |  And we're already into the last half hour of this match.
[4203.16 - 4208.16] P:1636.08 E:0.302063 |  England leading 1-0 and on course now for a quarter-final meeting with Sweden.
[4208.16 - 4212.16] P:1622.72 E:0.327410 |  But it is very finely balanced and there's an awful long way to go.
[4212.16 - 4216.16] P:1745.98 E:0.287912 |  And an awful lot in this match.
[4216.16 - 4217.16] P:1662.98 E:0.357226 |  Eyes needed everywhere.
[4217.16 - 4220.16] P:1610.14 E:0.333026 |  Just as well we've got Terry down at pitch level, Chris.
[4220.16 - 4222.16] P:1495.10 E:0.330879 |  He'll see everything down there.
[4222.16 - 4224.16] P:1646.05 E:0.336546 |  Backer waiting to come under the field.
[4224.16 - 4227.16] P:1588.67 E:0.343582 |  England just looking to take the sting out of it here in possession.
[4227.16 - 4229.16] P:1657.48 E:0.318411 |  Played back to John Stones.
[4229.16 - 4231.16] P:1719.95 E:0.315043 |  Dele Alli makes himself available.
[4231.16 - 4233.16] P:1482.61 E:0.324016 |  Dele Alli now over the halfway line.
[4233.16 - 4237.16] P:1592.15 E:0.330123 |  Alli rolls the ball forward down the left-hand side for Lindgard.
[4237.16 - 4241.16] P:1664.43 E:0.315236 |  But Mina is able to come across and steer it out of play.
[4241.16 - 4246.16] P:1648.39 E:0.314733 |  And I'm told there were 3 minutes and 31 seconds between the awarding
[4246.16 - 4249.16] P:1525.82 E:0.286278 |  and the taking of the England penalty.
[4249.16 - 4251.16] P:1447.85 E:0.327816 |  And the change is now going to be made.
[4251.16 - 4259.16] P:1526.80 E:0.280421 |  And as I say, it's Lermer coming off and Carlos Backer is coming onto the field for Colombia.
[4259.16 - 4262.16] P:1514.86 E:0.320853 |  And number 7, winning his 48th cap.
[4262.16 - 4265.16] P:1540.85 E:0.326761 |  The Villarreal man as he is currently.
[4265.16 - 4267.16] P:1542.62 E:0.312331 |  So England leading 1-0.
[4267.16 - 4275.16] P:1528.92 E:0.292286 |  Now Harry Kane continuing his record of scoring in every match in which he started as the England captain.
[4275.16 - 4279.16] P:1569.20 E:0.309195 |  8 of them it is now.
[4279.16 - 4283.16] P:1878.81 E:0.318392 |  That is 12 goals in those 8 matches in which he started.
[4283.16 - 4288.16] P:1699.22 E:0.264635 |  And also he has just scored in a 6th consecutive England game.
[4288.16 - 4294.16] P:1550.77 E:0.286526 |  And that's not been done since 1939 when Tommy Lawton scored in 6 in a row.
[4295.16 - 4299.16] P:1702.40 E:0.327226 |  The records just keep falling to the World Cup's leading scorer.
[4299.16 - 4302.16] P:1616.37 E:0.300380 |  Stretching his lead with 6 goals now.
[4302.16 - 4306.16] P:1519.27 E:0.290484 |  1-0 England lead, BBC 5 Live with England at the World Cup.
[4306.16 - 4309.16] P:1651.48 E:0.316200 |  You can listen as well via the BBC Sport app.
[4309.16 - 4313.16] P:1676.57 E:0.312076 |  6-0-6 on the way, the lines are open. 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3.

[4319.16 - 4322.16] P:1782.77 E:0.314944 |  England with a free kick out on the left-hand side.
[4322.16 - 4325.16] P:1770.99 E:0.322208 |  Second goal now would make it look quite rosy.
[4325.16 - 4328.16] P:1739.44 E:0.320433 |  Young fires it in deep towards Maguire at the back post.
[4328.16 - 4330.16] P:1734.19 E:0.304747 |  Who heads it across for the shot from Kane as blocked.
[4330.16 - 4332.16] P:1680.49 E:0.310118 |  Oh then Kane gets a touch.
[4332.16 - 4333.16] P:1517.42 E:0.315721 |  He went down in the box.
[4333.16 - 4339.16] P:1687.49 E:0.330736 |  It's curled into the back post and it's headed across the face of goal and over the top by Deli Ali and the Columbians.
[4339.16 - 4342.16] P:1700.79 E:0.334546 |  Now a racing towards referee Geiger again.
[4342.16 - 4344.16] P:1760.11 E:0.384750 |  Falcao, he's been shown a yellow card.
[4344.16 - 4349.16] P:1777.19 E:0.346582 |  Harry Meena is waving his arms at the referee and the referee, the Columbians it would appear.
[4349.16 - 4357.16] P:1702.86 E:0.326741 |  Sense that Mark Geiger, the referee can be got out here and Falcao is furious about something that's happened in there.
[4357.16 - 4359.16] P:1629.34 E:0.341109 |  I don't know what happened in there.
[4359.16 - 4363.16] P:1833.44 E:0.340110 |  I don't see what's happened but that wasn't a pin in Harry Maguire's look.
[4363.16 - 4365.16] P:1638.68 E:0.344046 |  He didn't get a yellow because he's died there.
[4365.16 - 4368.16] P:1828.64 E:0.300707 |  It's when the ball came in from Trippie.
[4368.16 - 4369.16] P:1543.20 E:0.335627 |  Here we go.
[4369.16 - 4371.16] P:1687.84 E:0.273494 |  They're saying he's off save still.
[4371.16 - 4373.16] P:1630.49 E:0.249261 |  But he didn't hit it.
[4373.16 - 4376.16] P:1564.00 E:0.326642 |  And Deli Ali with the header from the angle that was over.
[4376.16 - 4378.16] P:1776.39 E:0.247757 |  He was stretching for it.
[4378.16 - 4380.16] P:1776.88 E:0.301495 |  He was falling and he headed it over the top.
[4380.16 - 4385.16] P:1816.29 E:0.319227 |  The attendance by the way, 44,195 live.
[4385.16 - 4389.16] P:1780.65 E:0.312426 |  The cricket, the 2020 international is over on 5 live sports extra.
[4389.16 - 4394.16] P:1698.87 E:0.289243 |  India are chasing 160 to win it back in the UK at Old Trafford.
[4394.16 - 4397.16] P:1632.29 E:0.257950 |  Columbia Nail England 1.
[4397.16 - 4404.16] P:1740.17 E:0.274157 |  And we have played 63 nearly 64 minutes.
[4404.16 - 4410.16] P:1869.54 E:0.290862 |  Probably played at 55 as much as that.
[4410.16 - 4413.16] P:1896.55 E:0.298729 |  Stones with the ball at the back.
[4413.16 - 4416.16] P:1934.86 E:0.316761 |  Stones is caught there by Carlos Bacca.
[4416.16 - 4420.16] P:1861.58 E:0.331937 |  The ball had gone and it's a yellow card for Bacca who's just come onto the field.
[4420.16 - 4429.16] P:1808.74 E:0.284573 |  And Bacca as John Stones gets up, Bacca comes across and pulls the arm of John Stones.
[4429.16 - 4432.16] P:1764.78 E:0.313433 |  It's just laid, just a little bit naughty.
[4432.16 - 4441.16] P:1561.66 E:0.283406 |  India by the way, 126 for 1 after 12 all those needing as I say 160 to win.
[4441.16 - 4443.16] P:1521.32 E:0.308856 |  So that's a yellow card for Carlos.
[4443.16 - 4448.16] P:1684.54 E:0.270963 |  He's got a yellow card even before he had written his name on the team sheet.
[4448.16 - 4450.16] P:1743.44 E:0.305054 |  1-0 to England.
[4450.16 - 4452.16] P:1724.98 E:0.322309 |  Paul Bouncing into the penalty area.
[4452.16 - 4457.16] P:1601.48 E:0.302358 |  Mina had to head it away under pressure from Raheem Sterling and then it's played out.
[4457.16 - 4465.16] P:1954.76 E:0.346000 |  And then down goes Arias when he was challenged by Delhi Ali.
[4465.16 - 4472.16] P:1826.54 E:0.303108 |  And this, I don't think it's been refereed well but this is becoming a very difficult game to referee.
[4472.16 - 4477.16] P:1556.91 E:0.296420 |  You feel sorry for the referee, I've got to say the way, I'm not saying it's England, definitely not.
[4477.16 - 4480.16] P:1605.74 E:0.291010 |  But Columbia, the way their players are reacting, they're a disgrace.
[4480.16 - 4483.16] P:1615.31 E:0.301160 |  And I'm sure something will happen after this game regardless of the result.
[4483.16 - 4488.16] P:1648.05 E:0.279191 |  Now, Columbia 0, England 1, 25 minutes to play.
[4488.16 - 4494.16] P:1699.08 E:0.288455 |  England are winning, they're 25 minutes away from a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup against Sweden.
[4494.16 - 4500.16] P:1594.67 E:0.288364 |  England have not won a match in the knockout stages of a tournament since 2006.
[4500.16 - 4505.16] P:1699.98 E:0.306542 |  But they're almost literally going to have to battle for this.
[4506.16 - 4510.16] P:1749.05 E:0.330956 |  The Colombian supporters heavily outnumbering the England fans,
[4510.16 - 4516.16] P:1735.16 E:0.331452 |  rallying themselves and raising themselves as Delhi Ali is fouled on the half-way line.
[4516.16 - 4519.16] P:1731.60 E:0.312905 |  This time by Barrios who is on a yellow card.
[4519.16 - 4523.16] P:1786.18 E:0.275731 |  Currently five Colombians have been yellow carded.
[4523.16 - 4527.16] P:1629.80 E:0.280549 |  Barrios, Arias, Colos Sanchez, Falcao and Bacca.
[4527.16 - 4531.16] P:1634.04 E:0.290485 |  Jordan Henderson is the one England player to have received the yellow card.
[4531.16 - 4534.16] P:1710.47 E:0.292463 |  Free kick, 25 minutes to go.
[4534.16 - 4538.16] P:1671.23 E:0.288507 |  He's got to keep the calm England, keep playing the football, don't get involved.
[4538.16 - 4542.16] P:1687.29 E:0.299493 |  I'm sure that Garry Southgate will have spoken about this, this scenario.
[4542.16 - 4548.16] P:1829.38 E:0.294573 |  It's entirely possible that in the World Cup you will end up facing this sort of challenge.
[4548.16 - 4554.16] P:1885.79 E:0.304679 |  Maguire, who certainly dived in the Colombian penalty area
[4554.16 - 4559.16] P:1737.56 E:0.281136 |  and was fortunate not to be yellow carded, swings the pass out towards the right-hand side to Trippier
[4559.16 - 4562.16] P:1681.67 E:0.247707 |  where it was not out of play by Mohica.
[4562.16 - 4565.16] P:1714.28 E:0.260921 |  And Trippier to take the throw in.
[4565.16 - 4572.16] P:1777.79 E:0.288260 |  Harry Kane, who's just scored his 19th goal for England in his 27th appearance.
[4572.16 - 4575.16] P:1750.52 E:0.274809 |  Trippier plays the ball in towards the edge of the box.
[4575.16 - 4578.16] P:1484.59 E:0.293895 |  Cantero can't really get into the game in the second half.
[4578.16 - 4582.16] P:1633.13 E:0.292470 |  Cantero plays it up towards Bacca and now Colombia look to break.
[4582.16 - 4586.16] P:1696.21 E:0.298356 |  Cantero with the outside of his left boot couldn't find the pass down the right-hand side to Quadrado.
[4586.16 - 4590.16] P:1708.73 E:0.303851 |  In fact it was cut out by Ashley Young and Ashley Young has set off on a counter-attack.
[4590.16 - 4592.16] P:1761.62 E:0.327264 |  Raheem Sterling available.
[4592.16 - 4596.16] P:1762.26 E:0.311512 |  A lovely piece of skill from Sterling to set in Young who crosses it but there's no one there.
[4596.16 - 4601.16] P:1742.93 E:0.301385 |  And actually Young has gone down whether he was caught late after the ball had gone and not sure.
[4601.16 - 4603.16] P:1797.72 E:0.314706 |  I don't think Colombia will kick it out.
[4603.16 - 4610.16] P:1847.13 E:0.315871 |  The ball played up towards Falcao and the ball bounces out of play for a throw in near the half-way line.
[4610.16 - 4614.16] P:1917.53 E:0.329038 |  Ashley Young is still down way over there in the far corner.
[4614.16 - 4621.16] P:2004.55 E:0.335265 |  And now Jose Pacquermann is much more animated.
[4621.16 - 4624.16] P:1942.98 E:0.294943 |  He's changed his system.
[4624.16 - 4626.16] P:1803.54 E:0.295038 |  He's taken off under the holding midfielders.
[4626.16 - 4629.16] P:1817.27 E:0.281748 |  The referee has gone across to have a look at Ashley Young.
[4629.16 - 4632.16] P:1756.90 E:0.263355 |  It was Arias who put the challenge in on him.
[4632.16 - 4634.16] P:1881.66 E:0.252676 |  Young crossed.
[4634.16 - 4637.16] P:1820.60 E:0.303805 |  And really there's not a great deal in that.
[4637.16 - 4639.16] P:1785.58 E:0.295998 |  And he may have fallen awkwardly.
[4639.16 - 4641.16] P:1843.06 E:0.245702 |  I don't know but he stayed down.
[4641.16 - 4643.16] P:1754.19 E:0.289360 |  And so we've got a stoppage in play.
[4643.16 - 4647.16] P:1705.89 E:0.307644 |  So let's get another thought from Terry Butcher who's down at pitch level behind the goal.
[4647.16 - 4650.16] P:1908.43 E:0.323279 |  Well I think England just got to keep their course.
[4650.16 - 4654.16] P:1845.06 E:0.307706 |  Chris says it's anti-football from Colombia.
[4654.16 - 4656.16] P:1752.07 E:0.314623 |  I mean Quintero's on the ball.
[4656.16 - 4657.16] P:1804.30 E:0.353116 |  Occasionally it's sporadic.
[4657.16 - 4660.16] P:1848.98 E:0.326153 |  England win the ball back but it's just niggly niggly stuffing.
[4660.16 - 4662.16] P:1982.69 E:0.363849 |  They've just got to keep their discipline, keep their cool.
[4662.16 - 4666.16] P:2049.33 E:0.364105 |  And I think they'll get another goal because they've lost all discipline at Colombia.
[4666.16 - 4668.16] P:2089.76 E:0.362712 |  England can't afford to do that.
[4668.16 - 4671.16] P:2052.46 E:0.370759 |  Terry you must have played against this sort of approach over the years.
[4671.16 - 4673.16] P:2073.19 E:0.310821 |  Oh yeah.
[4673.16 - 4674.16] P:1972.99 E:0.377034 |  You can't rise to it.
[4674.16 - 4675.16] P:1890.83 E:0.344559 |  Honestly you want to do something.
[4675.16 - 4677.16] P:1882.70 E:0.354422 |  You want to throw something or whatever.
[4677.16 - 4678.16] P:1977.24 E:0.315079 |  You can't now.
[4678.16 - 4680.16] P:1866.62 E:0.333804 |  Especially with so many cameras about here and the referee.
[4680.16 - 4682.16] P:1879.61 E:0.344529 |  You don't know what this referee is going to do at all.
[4682.16 - 4684.16] P:1964.94 E:0.306037 |  So yeah, I've played in that.
[4684.16 - 4686.16] P:1739.05 E:0.337648 |  I thought those days were gone.
[4686.16 - 4688.16] P:1840.02 E:0.303752 |  You obviously don't want to see that back in football.
[4688.16 - 4689.16] P:1909.33 E:0.320936 |  But unfortunately it is.
[4689.16 - 4691.16] P:1879.60 E:0.298480 |  For a team that's got less quality than England.
[4691.16 - 4694.16] P:1868.41 E:0.319351 |  Less ability than England but they're resorting to these tactics.
[4694.16 - 4700.16] P:1981.24 E:0.335707 |  I think I'm right in saying that Colombia won the fair play award in Brazil at the World Cup four years ago
[4700.16 - 4704.16] P:1892.46 E:0.296547 |  when they entertained us with Jamez Rodriguez to the four.
[4704.16 - 4705.16] P:1736.31 E:0.293156 |  He can't play tonight.
[4705.16 - 4706.16] P:1632.32 E:0.263664 |  He's injured.
[4706.16 - 4707.16] P:1803.49 E:0.255444 |  One nil England lead.
[4707.16 - 4710.16] P:1753.92 E:0.335555 |  Now Jesse Lindgard is yellow carded.
[4710.16 - 4716.16] P:1868.02 E:0.283450 |  There wasn't much more than a little tap with his right boot on the back of Carlos Sanchez's leg.
[4716.16 - 4718.16] P:1462.03 E:0.302952 |  But that's a yellow card now for Jesse Lindgard.
[4718.16 - 4721.16] P:1768.80 E:0.253027 |  So that is seven yellow cards in the match.
[4721.16 - 4723.16] P:1506.25 E:0.270604 |  It's hard for the referee.
[4723.16 - 4724.16] P:1490.15 E:0.298873 |  Don't go his wrong.
[4724.16 - 4726.16] P:1721.13 E:0.252570 |  But he hasn't got to get carried away himself.
[4726.16 - 4731.16] P:1675.59 E:0.298753 |  He's got to try and stamp his authority on his game which he hasn't got at the minute.
[4731.16 - 4734.16] P:1653.71 E:0.242322 |  Colombia nil England won.
[4734.16 - 4740.16] P:1705.46 E:0.281874 |  Talk to us about this match 08 08 590 9693 Kelly Cates hosting 606.
[4740.16 - 4745.16] P:1694.28 E:0.293458 |  We'll bring you all of the interviews as well from the tunnel during the course of the program.
[4745.16 - 4747.16] P:1604.83 E:0.306776 |  You'll hear all that on the podcast as well in the morning.
[4747.16 - 4750.16] P:1659.48 E:0.316178 |  The World Cup Daily, the five live World Cup Daily podcast.
[4750.16 - 4756.16] P:1807.66 E:0.304198 |  The 2020 International is all that on five live sports extra.
[4756.16 - 4762.16] P:1781.07 E:0.304032 |  The Wimbledon coverage as well continues on the BBC Sport website and app.
[4762.16 - 4765.16] P:1758.65 E:0.294607 |  And more blanket coverage from Wimbledon tomorrow.
[4765.16 - 4770.16] P:1733.54 E:0.309578 |  But the World Cup here is alive in front of our eyes with England 1 nil up.
[4770.16 - 4773.16] P:1784.21 E:0.270289 |  Lindgard playing it back towards Maguire.
[4773.16 - 4779.16] P:1843.86 E:0.305785 |  Maguire the touch to stones who rolls it out square to his right to Kyle Walker.
[4779.16 - 4782.16] P:1857.23 E:0.295192 |  Now Falcao does have that support from Bakker.
[4782.16 - 4785.16] P:1701.19 E:0.286725 |  So Colombia playing with two men up front.
[4785.16 - 4789.16] P:1818.84 E:0.258515 |  Three at the back, one still screening to wing backs and they're pushing on.
[4789.16 - 4791.16] P:1803.38 E:0.276146 |  They realise the game's going away from them.
[4791.16 - 4793.16] P:1649.79 E:0.319082 |  They've got a challenge push on here.
[4793.16 - 4795.16] P:1868.56 E:0.249363 |  20 minutes to play.
[4795.16 - 4797.16] P:1781.97 E:0.285367 |  Ashley Young on the far side does well.
[4797.16 - 4800.16] P:1637.57 E:0.293681 |  They work the ball down the left wing towards Deli Alley.
[4800.16 - 4805.16] P:1669.63 E:0.276751 |  Deli Alley cuts back against Arias and then sees Young there in support.
[4805.16 - 4808.16] P:1751.96 E:0.310121 |  Young drops his shoulder, plays it infield towards Sterling.
[4808.16 - 4811.16] P:1847.05 E:0.286519 |  Now back towards Henderson, middle of the Colombian half.
[4811.16 - 4814.16] P:1943.61 E:0.282643 |  Henderson, his pass towards Trippia.
[4814.16 - 4816.16] P:1913.58 E:0.287303 |  Trippia just caught by Mohica.
[4816.16 - 4818.16] P:1861.50 E:0.297481 |  That's not given as a free kick.
[4818.16 - 4821.16] P:1899.43 E:0.311315 |  Kyle Walker was trying to referee the game himself there
[4821.16 - 4824.16] P:1832.37 E:0.302447 |  and the referee ignored England's claims for a free kick.
[4824.16 - 4827.16] P:1817.40 E:0.286751 |  I thought Trippia was caught and must say really close.
[4827.16 - 4829.16] P:2015.37 E:0.311687 |  I think there's not a lot in it.
[4829.16 - 4831.16] P:1998.60 E:0.308762 |  Tickford back into session.
[4831.16 - 4833.16] P:1907.17 E:0.282268 |  His long pass.
[4833.16 - 4837.16] P:1751.21 E:0.289241 |  Trippia jumps against Mohica and the ball evades both of them
[4837.16 - 4840.16] P:1775.14 E:0.306353 |  out of play for a throw in to Colombia.
[4840.16 - 4843.16] P:1827.45 E:0.328957 |  Barrios says, come on, give it to me.
[4843.16 - 4846.16] P:1872.20 E:0.299542 |  I want it on my chest and he does.
[4846.16 - 4849.16] P:1841.02 E:0.332016 |  Barrios then lifts the ball forward towards Bacca.
[4849.16 - 4852.16] P:1841.46 E:0.312849 |  Maguire's got to be careful, stands up strong.
[4852.16 - 4855.16] P:1867.86 E:0.334140 |  Bacca bounces into Maguire, goes down.
[4855.16 - 4859.16] P:1941.00 E:0.302408 |  Howls from the crowd, the Colombian fans for a free kick.
[4859.16 - 4862.16] P:1877.57 E:0.229605 |  Bacca as well, appeals, hands apart.
[4862.16 - 4864.16] P:1679.87 E:0.293772 |  Referee Geiger says no.
[4864.16 - 4867.16] P:1770.63 E:0.254183 |  Stones passing the ball away from his own penalty area.
[4867.16 - 4870.16] P:1694.09 E:0.294082 |  Maguire now young with a long pass downfield for Sterling to chase.
[4870.16 - 4874.16] P:1850.66 E:0.294945 |  Sterling has just nudged Arias off the ball.
[4874.16 - 4877.16] P:1648.38 E:0.297136 |  Arias used a bit of experience here, didn't he?
[4877.16 - 4879.16] P:1563.36 E:0.303619 |  He wasn't going to get it.
[4879.16 - 4881.16] P:1842.76 E:0.232351 |  He ran into Sterling really and falls to the ground.
[4881.16 - 4883.16] P:1747.60 E:0.225693 |  Referee buys it.
[4883.16 - 4885.16] P:1678.70 E:0.277744 |  1-0 England lead.
[4885.16 - 4889.16] P:1765.19 E:0.239651 |  Harry Kane's penalty in the 58th minute.
[4889.16 - 4893.16] P:1771.62 E:0.294863 |  Harry Kane, who is on the halfway line watching walk out.
[4893.16 - 4897.16] P:1830.99 E:0.253612 |  Cross into Colombian territory and then turn tail and head back into his own half
[4897.16 - 4899.16] P:1679.43 E:0.307368 |  and giving it to Trippia.
[4899.16 - 4907.16] P:1828.87 E:0.304811 |  Harry Kane, who now has 14 goals in his last 10 England appearances.
[4907.16 - 4912.16] P:1787.47 E:0.291550 |  And as I say, has matched the total that Gary Lenaker reached in 86.
[4912.16 - 4914.16] P:1773.74 E:0.332601 |  Ball played through to Lindgard.
[4914.16 - 4917.16] P:1775.51 E:0.323402 |  Lindgard looking to chip it across, but Davinson Sanchez slid across,
[4917.16 - 4919.16] P:1849.80 E:0.294690 |  went to ground and blocked it behind for a corner.
[4919.16 - 4921.16] P:1684.96 E:0.310044 |  Good football by England.
[4921.16 - 4923.16] P:1637.13 E:0.325011 |  Very patient, nice pace about it.
[4923.16 - 4926.16] P:1773.95 E:0.314076 |  Chris Passen, lot of good movement off the ball.
[4926.16 - 4928.16] P:1686.04 E:0.322293 |  Lindgard gets in there.
[4928.16 - 4930.16] P:1908.82 E:0.299169 |  It's a great tackle again.
[4930.16 - 4932.16] P:1800.07 E:0.342421 |  The two-cent-ars of Dilley Dixon's job for Cunger today.
[4932.16 - 4938.16] P:1832.13 E:0.297075 |  They have the young player of Yeri Mina, who's only 23 years old.
[4938.16 - 4941.16] P:1816.30 E:0.296887 |  Davinson Sanchez, 22 last month.
[4941.16 - 4944.16] P:1917.38 E:0.254896 |  Corner them to England from the left.
[4944.16 - 4946.16] P:1847.24 E:0.289983 |  They lead by one goal to nil.
[4946.16 - 4950.16] P:1885.99 E:0.280071 |  Time must have slowed for Garasovgate down there.
[4950.16 - 4951.16] P:1925.97 E:0.247208 |  Young takes it.
[4951.16 - 4952.16] P:1787.61 E:0.300742 |  Maguire with the header.
[4952.16 - 4955.16] P:1688.49 E:0.270815 |  Osbina just watches it land on the roof of his net.
[4955.16 - 4959.16] P:1682.85 E:0.295434 |  He was stretching high, so high that his gloves were actually over the top of the bar.
[4959.16 - 4963.16] P:1740.24 E:0.260500 |  In England, we're wondering whether it might have caught his gloves
[4963.16 - 4966.16] P:1855.86 E:0.266581 |  before it dropped onto the roof of the net.
[4966.16 - 4968.16] P:1795.77 E:0.276291 |  But the referee said no.
[4968.16 - 4971.16] P:1700.61 E:0.321266 |  Actually, he might have had a case just watching it again.
[4971.16 - 4974.16] P:1669.95 E:0.266206 |  Columbia nil, England won.
[4974.16 - 4980.16] P:1668.12 E:0.273137 |  Harry Maguire, here in Russia, has become only the second England player
[4980.16 - 4984.16] P:1646.16 E:0.289115 |  to have scored six goals at a World Cup finals tournament.
[4984.16 - 4988.16] P:1690.11 E:0.271211 |  He's got power to add if England progress.
[4988.16 - 4990.16] P:1709.71 E:0.324586 |  Here is Harry Kane.
[4990.16 - 4992.16] P:1666.57 E:0.260022 |  Kane, away from Carlos Sanchez.
[4992.16 - 4994.16] P:1719.02 E:0.294231 |  Three Colombians around him.
[4994.16 - 4999.16] P:1755.59 E:0.311515 |  Quadrado comes in with a heavy challenge, and Kane goes down, and it's a free kick.
[4999.16 - 5001.16] P:1827.44 E:0.287526 |  Two England in a good position left of Sanchez.
[5001.16 - 5005.16] P:1590.94 E:0.309723 |  I know, but he talks about Columbia being a good football team,
[5005.16 - 5006.16] P:1483.42 E:0.271353 |  and do this and do that.
[5006.16 - 5007.16] P:1458.02 E:0.298289 |  They've been animals tonight.
[5007.16 - 5010.16] P:1658.29 E:0.300159 |  They've been shocked, and they were discouraged to the game.
[5010.16 - 5011.16] P:1757.59 E:0.305705 |  Really?
[5011.16 - 5012.16] P:1406.68 E:0.263044 |  They said it would be as strong as that.
[5012.16 - 5014.16] P:1701.73 E:0.272277 |  I think they've been a disgrace.
[5014.16 - 5016.16] P:1586.16 E:0.299273 |  This is a World Cup, it's an exhibition.
[5016.16 - 5017.16] P:1615.48 E:0.213096 |  People want to watch good football.
[5017.16 - 5019.16] P:1584.90 E:0.278958 |  They just come out with a mentality.
[5019.16 - 5023.16] P:1667.11 E:0.281233 |  You have spoiled the game, foul, pushed the referee to the limit.
[5023.16 - 5024.16] P:1485.09 E:0.328768 |  You don't want to see it.
[5024.16 - 5026.16] P:1869.14 E:0.198812 |  I hope they get a hefty fine.
[5026.16 - 5027.16] P:1869.99 E:0.273783 |  Free kick to England.
[5027.16 - 5029.16] P:1849.38 E:0.272379 |  Young and Trippie are together.
[5029.16 - 5030.16] P:1806.78 E:0.332875 |  Trippie runs away.
[5030.16 - 5035.16] P:1937.82 E:0.280732 |  England have posed problems with this Ashley Young free kick that is whipped in.
[5035.16 - 5039.16] P:1870.29 E:0.304729 |  England have already won one penalty for wrestling in the penalty area.
[5039.16 - 5040.16] P:1858.50 E:0.297435 |  Young plays it into the back post.
[5040.16 - 5043.16] P:1860.64 E:0.283372 |  Kane goes for it, and actually the flag was up.
[5043.16 - 5046.16] P:1748.65 E:0.281973 |  He went for it with a Kung Fu style kick.
[5046.16 - 5049.16] P:1694.47 E:0.269977 |  Harry Kane, but couldn't make contact, and Eden if he had.
[5049.16 - 5051.16] P:1617.12 E:0.271940 |  As I say, the flag was up.
[5051.16 - 5053.16] P:1670.26 E:0.312701 |  So Columbia nail England one.
[5053.16 - 5056.16] P:1808.46 E:0.304557 |  Terry Butcher, you heard what Chris Waddle had to say there.
[5056.16 - 5058.16] P:1886.30 E:0.320412 |  Are you feeling similarly?
[5058.16 - 5059.16] P:2043.14 E:0.292502 |  Yes, absolutely.
[5059.16 - 5061.16] P:1914.06 E:0.305242 |  Chris 100 per cent spot on.
[5061.16 - 5064.16] P:1862.07 E:0.324930 |  I'll tell you what, on that occasion, because the referee has given the penalty for the free kick,
[5064.16 - 5066.16] P:1945.46 E:0.314101 |  they did not know what to do, Columbia.
[5066.16 - 5069.16] P:1834.06 E:0.313113 |  Whether they stick or twist, and in the end they let England's runners through.
[5069.16 - 5072.16] P:1857.41 E:0.301731 |  The ball wasn't quite right, and they get away with it, Columbia.
[5072.16 - 5077.16] P:1882.62 E:0.323824 |  But they don't know what to do now, and all their discipline has gone, Columbia.
[5077.16 - 5078.16] P:1982.56 E:0.384979 |  Falcow goes.
[5078.16 - 5081.16] P:1815.65 E:0.299974 |  Columbia get a fortunate break, and the ball in centre field.
[5081.16 - 5085.16] P:1740.00 E:0.295629 |  Falcow gives it to Quadrado, a couple of step overs, and then Quadrado passes it.
[5085.16 - 5088.16] P:1726.28 E:0.309099 |  Straight to Delhi Alley on the edge of the England penalty area.
[5088.16 - 5093.16] P:1724.67 E:0.258068 |  That's very interesting what Terry says there, and it's at his end of the field now,
[5093.16 - 5099.16] P:1709.46 E:0.266928 |  where England are attacking, that there could be possibilities for England from set pieces,
[5099.16 - 5105.16] P:1676.93 E:0.272201 |  because Columbia are wary of the fact that they've already conceded a penalty
[5105.16 - 5109.16] P:1761.98 E:0.269969 |  for the holding of Harry Kane.
[5109.16 - 5114.16] P:1716.88 E:0.309693 |  It was Mojica on the left-hand side, couldn't get past Tripier.
[5114.16 - 5117.16] P:1808.94 E:0.252428 |  Tridon again couldn't get past Tripier.
[5117.16 - 5122.16] P:1692.33 E:0.280071 |  Now Barrios rolls a pass out to the right-hand side to Arias.
[5122.16 - 5127.16] P:1785.66 E:0.271249 |  Quintero thought about going with the ball to the edge of the box, thought twice.
[5127.16 - 5130.16] P:1611.50 E:0.330267 |  Arias uses Quadrado on the right-hand side.
[5130.16 - 5134.16] P:1600.64 E:0.316061 |  Quadrado's aerial ball in is headed away by Walker, headed further away by Lingard,
[5134.16 - 5136.16] P:1669.91 E:0.307211 |  but back to the yellow shirts of Columbia.
[5136.16 - 5141.16] P:1688.94 E:0.291528 |  Devinson Sanchez shapes his pass towards Quintero again on his left foot.
[5141.16 - 5144.16] P:1744.16 E:0.296308 |  Quintero's ball in towards Bakker, Bakker got a touch to that,
[5144.16 - 5148.16] P:1755.57 E:0.303858 |  but it bounced down and was swept away by the left foot of Kieran Tripier.
[5148.16 - 5151.16] P:1705.57 E:0.349439 |  England just come off the pace lately, last couple of minutes showing that's why
[5151.16 - 5153.16] P:1712.86 E:0.317965 |  Columbia is putting some passes together.
[5153.16 - 5156.16] P:1777.90 E:0.294906 |  They've not done this old game, and England's just dropped off.
[5156.16 - 5159.16] P:1663.53 E:0.312824 |  I don't like to see that, you let the tempo to keep going a little bit.
[5159.16 - 5161.16] P:1736.97 E:0.306702 |  Maybe a couple of players are feeling the pace.
[5161.16 - 5163.16] P:1791.73 E:0.268837 |  We're into the last 15 minutes.
[5163.16 - 5166.16] P:1686.52 E:0.284216 |  Gareth Southgate is yet to make a substitution.
[5166.16 - 5168.16] P:1603.86 E:0.248928 |  15 minutes.
[5168.16 - 5171.16] P:1561.09 E:0.333086 |  England are away from the place in the quarter-finals.
[5171.16 - 5174.16] P:1737.88 E:0.337506 |  Ball into the penalty area, Bakker lifts it across, headed away,
[5174.16 - 5176.16] P:1767.00 E:0.297318 |  and then it's cleared crucially.
[5176.16 - 5178.16] P:1615.42 E:0.332903 |  A little touch by Deli Alley on the edge of the area.
[5178.16 - 5180.16] P:1658.79 E:0.351694 |  Ashley Young gets a touch as well to play it away to Sterling.
[5180.16 - 5183.16] P:1833.55 E:0.317522 |  Sterling now running, Sterling with England coming forward.
[5183.16 - 5184.16] P:1948.83 E:0.349405 |  It's three against two.
[5184.16 - 5185.16] P:1886.78 E:0.337934 |  Sterling still going.
[5185.16 - 5186.16] P:1885.02 E:0.339573 |  Trace to find Lingard.
[5186.16 - 5188.16] P:1854.19 E:0.358919 |  Lingard into the box, oh, he's challenged.
[5188.16 - 5190.16] P:1859.34 E:0.337272 |  Devinson Sanchez comes in with a challenge.
[5190.16 - 5193.16] P:1820.80 E:0.319566 |  Referee says no penalty.
[5193.16 - 5195.16] P:1779.95 E:0.316408 |  Must have taken the ball.
[5195.16 - 5196.16] P:1585.15 E:0.301360 |  Why would Lingard go down?
[5196.16 - 5198.16] P:1621.70 E:0.325989 |  He's just got the pull of the trigger, wasn't he?
[5198.16 - 5199.16] P:1777.14 E:0.266023 |  So why would he go down?
[5199.16 - 5202.16] P:1634.56 E:0.331332 |  Well, if he hasn't, if he's dived, he deserves a yell at it.
[5202.16 - 5205.16] P:1761.31 E:0.295419 |  But from where we're sitting, which is quite a way away from the incident,
[5205.16 - 5206.16] P:1362.42 E:0.342895 |  Terry will have a proper view of it.
[5206.16 - 5208.16] P:1877.92 E:0.239236 |  Terry, what did you think?
[5208.16 - 5210.16] P:1850.50 E:0.322765 |  I thought he's caught in there.
[5210.16 - 5212.16] P:1749.88 E:0.335922 |  Lingard was about to pull the trigger,
[5212.16 - 5215.16] P:1834.16 E:0.309062 |  and the sliding leg comes alongside Lingard, takes him down.
[5215.16 - 5217.16] P:1883.52 E:0.326494 |  And for me, that's a penalty.
[5217.16 - 5219.16] P:1909.00 E:0.296868 |  It's a stick-on penalty.
[5219.16 - 5222.16] P:1705.69 E:0.305876 |  Columbia crossing from the left, but it's headed away on the edge of the box
[5222.16 - 5224.16] P:1729.51 E:0.258861 |  by John Stones.
[5224.16 - 5226.16] P:1587.67 E:0.297523 |  Terry will have a great view of that.
[5226.16 - 5228.16] P:1624.29 E:0.302123 |  We've not seen it again on the replay yet,
[5228.16 - 5230.16] P:1336.88 E:0.292589 |  as Lingard plays at the Henderson.
[5230.16 - 5232.16] P:1552.02 E:0.294175 |  Henderson's ball across, and now Columbia are having to
[5232.16 - 5235.16] P:1621.01 E:0.337827 |  commit men downfield, and gaps are opening for England.
[5235.16 - 5237.16] P:1686.45 E:0.330854 |  Lingard's got to use the ball well.
[5237.16 - 5239.16] P:1735.03 E:0.347866 |  That's the key now, got that composure.
[5239.16 - 5242.16] P:1855.00 E:0.316247 |  Right pass, right selection.
[5242.16 - 5244.16] P:1637.28 E:0.364453 |  It's 1-0 to England.
[5244.16 - 5247.16] P:1596.15 E:0.329373 |  Harry Kane's penalty making the difference, but a niggly, awful game.
[5247.16 - 5249.16] P:1661.29 E:0.316402 |  Ball played in towards the edge of the box to Falcao.
[5249.16 - 5251.16] P:1729.79 E:0.321678 |  Falcao turning onto his left foot.
[5251.16 - 5253.16] P:1716.98 E:0.299444 |  Falcao has to play it back out of the penalty area
[5253.16 - 5255.16] P:1556.44 E:0.309821 |  to Mojica.
[5255.16 - 5259.16] P:1609.33 E:0.274019 |  Mojica has Kyle Walker in front of him, so it has to turn.
[5259.16 - 5261.16] P:1593.99 E:0.285751 |  Play it back to Carlos Sanchez.
[5261.16 - 5263.16] P:1593.49 E:0.307864 |  Now the dangerous Quintera.
[5263.16 - 5265.16] P:1668.57 E:0.279881 |  Quintera's ball to the edge of the box.
[5265.16 - 5267.16] P:1713.94 E:0.303706 |  Falcao challenged and fouled.
[5267.16 - 5270.16] P:1635.66 E:0.306759 |  Fri kick to England, and I think we'll see the second Columbian change.
[5270.16 - 5274.16] P:1673.33 E:0.290719 |  Still no immediate sign of England making their first substitution.
[5274.16 - 5279.16] P:1523.52 E:0.242798 |  And it's going to be midfielder, Matheus Uribe,
[5279.16 - 5282.16] P:1663.79 E:0.313296 |  who is coming on into the midfield for Carlos Sanchez,
[5282.16 - 5286.16] P:1549.05 E:0.296731 |  the Columbians who is on a yellow card.
[5286.16 - 5288.16] P:1532.65 E:0.304065 |  Whether that's a factor or not, I don't know.
[5288.16 - 5293.16] P:1585.12 E:0.288711 |  Uribe, who is a box-to-box midfielder,
[5293.16 - 5296.16] P:1514.25 E:0.282620 |  who plays in Mexico for Club America,
[5296.16 - 5298.16] P:1611.90 E:0.313306 |  being in excellent form this year.
[5298.16 - 5301.16] P:1740.08 E:0.284961 |  He is on the number 15.
[5303.16 - 5308.16] P:1733.22 E:0.307640 |  And we have just over 11 minutes to play.
[5308.16 - 5311.16] P:1660.89 E:0.256792 |  It's going to be tense.
[5311.16 - 5315.16] P:1491.79 E:0.295968 |  Unless England can come up with a second goal.
[5315.16 - 5317.16] P:1516.30 E:0.298945 |  Kane heads it forward towards the edge of the box.
[5317.16 - 5324.16] P:1737.78 E:0.284250 |  That's nodded away by Dignina Falcao with a touch on the halfway line.
[5324.16 - 5328.16] P:1747.83 E:0.299576 |  And then Quintera to the right-hand side, to Cuadrado.
[5328.16 - 5330.16] P:1651.32 E:0.311362 |  England are going to make a change.
[5330.16 - 5333.16] P:1579.97 E:0.286261 |  It's Eric Dyer, I see, being prepared down to our right.
[5333.16 - 5335.16] P:1750.23 E:0.320954 |  Falcao stretches for it, can't get to it.
[5335.16 - 5338.16] P:1670.97 E:0.294878 |  John Stone steps forward and passes the ball to Harry Kane.
[5338.16 - 5340.16] P:1693.21 E:0.306745 |  Kane has a look over his shoulder.
[5340.16 - 5344.16] P:1671.76 E:0.312796 |  Kane tracks the ball away from Barrios and then bundled over.
[5344.16 - 5346.16] P:1632.68 E:0.338082 |  It's a free kick to England on the halfway line.
[5346.16 - 5348.16] P:1489.72 E:0.309742 |  Barrios, who has been yellow carded.
[5348.16 - 5351.16] P:1576.26 E:0.334148 |  If we take Dele Alli off, who has just come out of an injury,
[5351.16 - 5356.16] P:1535.97 E:0.302269 |  would think Dyer can sit alongside Ennisson, just to keep it...
[5356.16 - 5361.16] P:1496.35 E:0.318318 |  Just basically kill a game off and then use it well on the counter-attack.
[5361.16 - 5363.16] P:1759.10 E:0.286967 |  Here's the change.
[5363.16 - 5366.16] P:1522.36 E:0.305605 |  First change for England, quite right Chris Dele Alli,
[5366.16 - 5369.16] P:1695.65 E:0.275931 |  whether he's a striker or not,
[5369.16 - 5373.16] P:1765.81 E:0.326415 |  is actually right away off on the far side of the field.
[5373.16 - 5375.16] P:1816.56 E:0.306761 |  Can you believe that?
[5375.16 - 5377.16] P:1949.35 E:0.314956 |  What a shock.
[5377.16 - 5380.16] P:1744.55 E:0.332177 |  So it's not only the Colombians who know one or two tricks.
[5380.16 - 5382.16] P:1826.51 E:0.290357 |  There you go.
[5382.16 - 5387.16] P:1884.07 E:0.303112 |  And Dele Alli, in no hurry, is doing one of those slow runs off the field.
[5387.16 - 5389.16] P:1829.29 E:0.306130 |  Let's bring Terry Butcher in,
[5389.16 - 5391.16] P:1834.31 E:0.327734 |  because this substitution might take some time,
[5391.16 - 5394.16] P:1923.56 E:0.303298 |  because Dele Alli's going across the shakehands with Jordan Henderson.
[5394.16 - 5398.16] P:1958.11 E:0.298245 |  Yeah, just thinking that, myself and Jordan Henderson,
[5398.16 - 5400.16] P:1773.67 E:0.327414 |  just outnumbered in the middle of the park.
[5400.16 - 5404.16] P:1761.34 E:0.317138 |  England, Harry Kane headed the ball and got headed back over the top of Henderson,
[5404.16 - 5407.16] P:1865.18 E:0.292630 |  and there was the midfield player for Colombia to pick it up,
[5407.16 - 5410.16] P:1824.88 E:0.322841 |  so he just plug in that midfield, two midfield players in there,
[5410.16 - 5412.16] P:1867.99 E:0.308701 |  and I just secured a little bit.
[5412.16 - 5415.16] P:1777.03 E:0.322569 |  It's not sitting back, just making sure that we don't...
[5415.16 - 5417.16] P:1877.27 E:0.277666 |  Just get overrun in the middle of the park.
[5417.16 - 5419.16] P:1938.89 E:0.305581 |  That's a good play by Garas Southgate, I think.
[5419.16 - 5421.16] P:1986.59 E:0.299596 |  Good substitution.
[5421.16 - 5423.16] P:1909.82 E:0.271526 |  Garas Southgate puts his arm around Dele Alli,
[5423.16 - 5425.16] P:1720.60 E:0.281944 |  gives him a pat on the back,
[5425.16 - 5428.16] P:1691.40 E:0.293036 |  and Eric Dyer comes on to play alongside Jordan Henderson in there
[5428.16 - 5430.16] P:1737.09 E:0.279391 |  for the remainder of this game.
[5430.16 - 5432.16] P:1762.88 E:0.263944 |  There are 10 minutes to play.
[5432.16 - 5434.16] P:1626.88 E:0.303846 |  England are winning 1-0.
[5434.16 - 5437.16] P:1758.02 E:0.304247 |  This is BBC Radio 5 Live, live with England at the World Cup,
[5437.16 - 5440.16] P:1690.43 E:0.289784 |  and we are 10 minutes away, also, plus at a time,
[5440.16 - 5445.16] P:1565.10 E:0.243443 |  from seeing England take their place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
[5445.16 - 5449.16] P:1797.87 E:0.348051 |  Oh, but Kyle Walker's caught in possession on the halfway line by Backer.
[5449.16 - 5451.16] P:1878.97 E:0.323950 |  Backer's off and running.
[5451.16 - 5454.16] P:1880.77 E:0.372144 |  He's going to Caguardo. Caguardo shot his over.
[5454.16 - 5457.16] P:1785.55 E:0.332223 |  He's blazed it over, and that is a big escape for England,
[5457.16 - 5459.16] P:1726.62 E:0.309276 |  after Kyle Walker's mistake.
[5459.16 - 5461.16] P:1634.68 E:0.295290 |  Well, he just sometimes gets caught in possession.
[5461.16 - 5464.16] P:1530.23 E:0.329586 |  He dawdled on the ball, and you can't at this level.
[5464.16 - 5467.16] P:1807.84 E:0.301477 |  Obviously, he's trying to play back to John Stone.
[5467.16 - 5471.16] P:1768.46 E:0.309541 |  He's got a little bit like a concentration, too sloppy.
[5471.16 - 5473.16] P:1727.90 E:0.279173 |  And Caguardo, a good chance.
[5473.16 - 5476.16] P:1681.24 E:0.314417 |  He's got at least at his target, and he's blazed it high and weighed.
[5476.16 - 5480.16] P:1733.12 E:0.252177 |  Columbia, Caguardo should have made England pay for that mistake.
[5480.16 - 5486.16] P:1670.22 E:0.283874 |  Should have. That's a bad miss by Columbia, in every sense.
[5486.16 - 5489.16] P:1769.82 E:0.311154 |  So it's still 1-0 to England,
[5492.16 - 5496.16] P:1727.39 E:0.276787 |  and we are in the 82nd minute.
[5496.16 - 5501.16] P:1652.47 E:0.281932 |  Hang on to your hats, everyone, but here in the car, this will be a tense journey.
[5501.16 - 5504.16] P:1739.37 E:0.283715 |  Sweaty hands on the driving wheel, I suspect.
[5504.16 - 5509.16] P:1796.48 E:0.275709 |  Here's McGuire. McGuire playing the ball back to Tickford.
[5509.16 - 5511.16] P:1858.44 E:0.310118 |  Tickford touch on to his right foot.
[5511.16 - 5516.16] P:1772.47 E:0.306333 |  Tickford, a long fall downfield towards Lindgard.
[5516.16 - 5518.16] P:1764.31 E:0.355879 |  Kane plays it through to Lindgard.
[5518.16 - 5521.16] P:1780.90 E:0.317900 |  Lindgard takes it on to the penalty area, but took a poor touch, actually,
[5521.16 - 5525.16] P:1812.78 E:0.290346 |  and the ball bounce behind, and it's been given as a free kick, actually.
[5525.16 - 5529.16] P:1659.03 E:0.271913 |  It was a bit of a bad touch, and all of us got back there,
[5529.16 - 5532.16] P:1663.34 E:0.287543 |  and Lindgard, as you say, it's a bad touch.
[5532.16 - 5535.16] P:1643.62 E:0.302268 |  He cuts inside, and he's got his eyes.
[5535.16 - 5539.16] P:1606.72 E:0.322235 |  He's just running, and really embarrassed, and he had a real bit of it, which you'd expect.
[5539.16 - 5541.16] P:1631.81 E:0.299684 |  And he gets the free kick.
[5541.16 - 5543.16] P:1582.69 E:0.291300 |  Yeah. 1-0 to England.
[5546.16 - 5550.16] P:1630.38 E:0.315631 |  Gavin Sincenches was being put under pressure by Lindgard.
[5550.16 - 5552.16] P:1791.31 E:0.241414 |  He's trying to hold him off.
[5552.16 - 5558.16] P:1725.14 E:0.280737 |  England are pressing well here. Eric Dyer with a challenge on Uribe.
[5558.16 - 5561.16] P:1719.71 E:0.314481 |  Harry Kane now takes it up, tries to take it on through the middle.
[5561.16 - 5566.16] P:1856.99 E:0.310838 |  He's fouled by Falcao. It's a free kick, good position for England.
[5566.16 - 5569.16] P:1632.96 E:0.312108 |  8-9 yards forward of the centre-circle.
[5569.16 - 5575.16] P:1596.36 E:0.309121 |  Kane, who has been very closely patrolled this evening.
[5575.16 - 5577.16] P:1516.11 E:0.326407 |  He's taken a few bangs.
[5577.16 - 5582.16] P:1622.66 E:0.317349 |  Harry Kane, England need him fit, but they're going to make further progress at this World Cup.
[5582.16 - 5586.16] P:1649.69 E:0.303984 |  But he's on his feet. The England captain goes scorer again tonight.
[5586.16 - 5589.16] P:1648.70 E:0.305195 |  He's scored in six consecutive England appearances.
[5589.16 - 5592.16] P:1533.27 E:0.318380 |  That's not been done since 1939.
[5592.16 - 5596.16] P:1725.68 E:0.324576 |  And he takes his position. Harry Kane, tall and imposing.
[5596.16 - 5598.16] P:1626.62 E:0.292380 |  Blond hair swept back on the edge of the box.
[5598.16 - 5600.16] P:1607.74 E:0.308044 |  Tripier plays it in, looking for Maguire.
[5600.16 - 5604.16] P:1575.94 E:0.284712 |  Maguire heads it across the face of Gould, and it drops beyond the far post.
[5604.16 - 5607.16] P:1570.24 E:0.343110 |  It's just been a little bit too high, the crosses for a moment.
[5607.16 - 5611.16] P:1603.65 E:0.339590 |  He's really been reaching for a lot. He just can't get up out across the goal, and can't head it down.
[5612.16 - 5617.16] P:1633.46 E:0.335510 |  And Columbia take a goal kick out to Barrios on the edge of the penalty area.
[5617.16 - 5623.16] P:1832.28 E:0.308782 |  Barrios to Mina.
[5623.16 - 5628.16] P:1718.61 E:0.340802 |  And then Quadrado finds Uribe, and Uribe over the halfway line to Bacca.
[5628.16 - 5632.16] P:1683.46 E:0.305899 |  And Bacca now puts in field and plays it into the congested area.
[5632.16 - 5637.16] P:1882.93 E:0.334037 |  The ball looked as though it struck the arm of stones there as it was played forward.
[5637.16 - 5641.16] P:1635.39 E:0.315859 |  But no free kick, and Columbia have the ball again inside their own half.
[5641.16 - 5644.16] P:1573.74 E:0.307752 |  Grassman scores, looking for any little advantage.
[5644.16 - 5648.16] P:1704.69 E:0.261737 |  84 minutes played.
[5648.16 - 5653.16] P:1711.48 E:0.278445 |  Barrios here to Uribe.
[5653.16 - 5656.16] P:1650.96 E:0.296737 |  Now Mojica, up against Tripier.
[5656.16 - 5660.16] P:1646.99 E:0.266574 |  Mojica tries to go around the outside, and Tripier puts in the challenge.
[5660.16 - 5662.16] P:1677.42 E:0.324646 |  Blocked out of play by Tripier for a throwing.
[5662.16 - 5666.16] P:1730.94 E:0.287304 |  It's going to be a long six minutes, plus added time there.
[5666.16 - 5670.16] P:1697.82 E:0.302312 |  The interest is there, and Stoppaging put on.
[5670.16 - 5674.16] P:1826.05 E:0.339117 |  It's got to be at least five. It's got to be six, seven, eight minutes.
[5674.16 - 5677.16] P:1741.95 E:0.292318 |  Throw in. That was a foul throw. Surely.
[5677.16 - 5681.16] P:1653.60 E:0.260019 |  Halkau plays it back to throwing take a Mojica.
[5681.16 - 5685.16] P:1585.99 E:0.291299 |  Then it's swung in by Contero, headed away by Walker.
[5685.16 - 5687.16] P:1732.44 E:0.238033 |  Comes out for Columbia.
[5687.16 - 5689.16] P:1616.57 E:0.309241 |  Arias, Quadrado has a look up.
[5689.16 - 5691.16] P:1717.04 E:0.315608 |  Here's the delivery from Quadrado.
[5691.16 - 5694.16] P:1715.14 E:0.329754 |  It's headed by Davinson Sanchez, right across the penalty area.
[5694.16 - 5697.16] P:1716.77 E:0.334089 |  And Mojica does very well to keep it in on the slide, actually.
[5697.16 - 5699.16] P:1751.05 E:0.302245 |  Tripier's within, goes for the byline.
[5699.16 - 5701.16] P:1804.85 E:0.313270 |  Gets the cross over to the back post.
[5701.16 - 5703.16] P:1873.85 E:0.344798 |  Falkau stretching over the top of Henderson.
[5703.16 - 5706.16] P:1599.71 E:0.300173 |  Could do nothing other than head it wide of the far post.
[5706.16 - 5708.16] P:1423.96 E:0.327117 |  I thought it was a foul anyway.
[5708.16 - 5711.16] P:1613.25 E:0.330004 |  Referee didn't give any way to see where the ball ended up, which obviously was behind the goal.
[5711.16 - 5716.16] P:1530.37 E:0.326503 |  And actually, Ashley Young and Harry Maguire are actually pulling Jordan Henderson away from the scene of this,
[5716.16 - 5721.16] P:1623.35 E:0.318458 |  just in case it should flare up again and Henderson is on a yellow card.
[5721.16 - 5723.16] P:1758.79 E:0.323074 |  Down to pitch side again, Terry Butcher.
[5723.16 - 5726.16] P:1886.39 E:0.340918 |  Well, that ball was out when it went back out to the touch line.
[5726.16 - 5729.16] P:1958.47 E:0.338621 |  I can see it virtually right along the line. The line's room is hopeless.
[5729.16 - 5733.16] P:1949.60 E:0.331537 |  That ball was out. There should have been an England throw on that left-hand side.
[5733.16 - 5734.16] P:1983.33 E:0.348661 |  Thanks, Terry.
[5734.16 - 5737.16] P:1796.52 E:0.313782 |  Kara Southgate just having a word with Kieran Tripier.
[5737.16 - 5740.16] P:1744.19 E:0.303085 |  85 minutes played, almost 86.
[5740.16 - 5745.16] P:1650.07 E:0.279246 |  England minutes away from the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 2006.
[5745.16 - 5748.16] P:1557.91 E:0.310607 |  Sweden will be their opponents there.
[5748.16 - 5751.16] P:1571.48 E:0.274186 |  Oh, a stretch for Columbia at the back.
[5751.16 - 5754.16] P:1699.15 E:0.276500 |  And they've just been able to clear it away.
[5754.16 - 5756.16] P:1776.64 E:0.283546 |  Mohica to Davinson Sanchez.
[5756.16 - 5760.16] P:1730.71 E:0.257173 |  And now, Quintero up towards Falkau.
[5760.16 - 5764.16] P:1766.79 E:0.277088 |  Harry Maguire coolly passes it into Eric Dyer.
[5764.16 - 5766.16] P:1721.89 E:0.304870 |  And Jenny Vardy, I see, just down to my right.
[5766.16 - 5769.16] P:1578.71 E:0.276755 |  There's going to be the next England man to come onto the field.
[5769.16 - 5770.16] P:1740.95 E:0.245025 |  Falkau.
[5770.16 - 5772.16] P:1670.95 E:0.317043 |  Columbia have to raise themselves here.
[5772.16 - 5774.16] P:1572.23 E:0.333858 |  They're going out of the World Cup unless they can score a goal.
[5775.16 - 5779.16] P:1713.01 E:0.311829 |  They'll drill the crossfield by Quadrado, but straight onto the head of Harry Kane.
[5779.16 - 5782.16] P:1619.25 E:0.308571 |  Vardy up with Sterling, because they're pushing on his gaps.
[5782.16 - 5784.16] P:1657.94 E:0.334068 |  Vardy can use his pace. You don't have to play here.
[5784.16 - 5786.16] P:1649.16 E:0.310330 |  Any little board, just play one over the top.
[5786.16 - 5788.16] P:1719.97 E:0.281910 |  Yeah, good thinking, that, isn't it?
[5788.16 - 5791.16] P:1866.34 E:0.330045 |  Falkau gets the ball back on his right foot, shoots low.
[5791.16 - 5794.16] P:1795.02 E:0.324169 |  Straight at Pickford, who's able to kill it with his gloves,
[5794.16 - 5796.16] P:1736.96 E:0.284845 |  and then drop onto it.
[5796.16 - 5799.16] P:1715.69 E:0.307113 |  The shot from 22-23 yards.
[5799.16 - 5802.16] P:1640.07 E:0.322507 |  Yeah, I mean, they've improved slightly as they've made the Suggs Columbia,
[5802.16 - 5805.16] P:1560.28 E:0.298449 |  but they don't deserve anything the way they've conduct with themselves
[5805.16 - 5807.16] P:1796.94 E:0.318932 |  and they've been in a food disgrace.
[5807.16 - 5811.16] P:1962.16 E:0.338341 |  This is for their niggly fowls, for their gamesmanship,
[5811.16 - 5814.16] P:2021.59 E:0.326914 |  but it cost them.
[5814.16 - 5820.16] P:1842.46 E:0.288583 |  They ended up conceding the penalty for Carlos Sanchez's wrestling
[5820.16 - 5823.16] P:1531.14 E:0.286384 |  at Harry Kane inside the penalty area.
[5823.16 - 5827.16] P:1721.21 E:0.309827 |  And the Bar video assistant referee confirmed it.
[5827.16 - 5831.16] P:1784.51 E:0.268287 |  We're going to see Vardy come on, but also, as well,
[5831.16 - 5839.16] P:1753.76 E:0.289102 |  for Columbia, Luis Muriel, who there was a thought that he might play.
[5839.16 - 5842.16] P:1723.62 E:0.265337 |  Muriel in the absence of James Rodriguez,
[5842.16 - 5846.16] P:1725.25 E:0.299784 |  as you said, Chris, Raheem Sterling is the England player
[5846.16 - 5849.16] P:1759.12 E:0.258644 |  who will be replaced by Jamie Vardy.
[5849.16 - 5852.16] P:1700.35 E:0.306887 |  He's 25th captainite, Jamie Vardy.
[5852.16 - 5856.16] P:1774.22 E:0.285215 |  And it's Quintero who's off for Columbia.
[5856.16 - 5862.16] P:1657.70 E:0.277583 |  Well, his influence in the second half has been limited, Quintero.
[5862.16 - 5866.16] P:1680.03 E:0.270048 |  Yeah, he kept stretching off.
[5866.16 - 5868.16] P:1600.08 E:0.327305 |  I don't know if he got crumped early in the second half or what,
[5868.16 - 5873.16] P:1668.82 E:0.290138 |  but he just didn't have any movement.
[5873.16 - 5877.16] P:1596.36 E:0.316395 |  Raheem Sterling gets a hug from Garrus Southgate
[5877.16 - 5881.16] P:1620.13 E:0.288856 |  and all of the England staff and their grey tops down to our right.
[5881.16 - 5884.16] P:1564.34 E:0.295129 |  And we have now, we've played 88 minutes,
[5884.16 - 5887.16] P:1441.28 E:0.313384 |  less than two minutes to play, and then it's a matter of how many minutes
[5887.16 - 5892.16] P:1706.20 E:0.263660 |  have been added on, but brace yourselves,
[5892.16 - 5896.16] P:1695.47 E:0.270803 |  because it'll be at least five, six, possibly seven.
[5896.16 - 5899.16] P:1654.89 E:0.239619 |  We've had long, long delays.
[5899.16 - 5903.16] P:1754.15 E:0.270040 |  Ball hooked forward for Columbia, Walker with a header.
[5903.16 - 5908.16] P:1786.27 E:0.250997 |  Then it falls to McGuire, who's able to volley it towards Harry Kane.
[5908.16 - 5913.16] P:1860.13 E:0.329252 |  Kane is tripped and that is disputed by Uribe.
[5913.16 - 5916.16] P:1667.22 E:0.325684 |  It was a foul, though. I don't know what I'm arguing about.
[5916.16 - 5918.16] P:1852.87 E:0.266827 |  Davidson Sanchez was the first foul,
[5918.16 - 5923.16] P:1721.89 E:0.296596 |  and then as Harry Kane takes the ball away, it pulls him down, so it's a foul.
[5923.16 - 5926.16] P:1708.84 E:0.270150 |  England in no hurry to take it.
[5926.16 - 5929.16] P:1782.54 E:0.272136 |  Firing, fire with fire here.
[5929.16 - 5936.16] P:1835.02 E:0.268620 |  Walker, dummies, out-ragiously to take it, but then doesn't.
[5936.16 - 5940.16] P:1948.15 E:0.299058 |  England, in fact, Walker leaves it to Trippia.
[5940.16 - 5942.16] P:1902.30 E:0.271175 |  That'll eat up a few more seconds.
[5942.16 - 5947.16] P:1772.33 E:0.292841 |  We're in the 90th minute now, 1-0 England lead, BBC Five Live, 6-06 to follow.
[5947.16 - 5949.16] P:1707.68 E:0.267519 |  Get your calls in to talk about this.
[5949.16 - 5952.16] P:1706.00 E:0.287009 |  England against Sweden would be the scenario.
[5952.16 - 5958.16] P:1651.57 E:0.262254 |  Not counting any chickens. 08, 085, 909, 693 to talk.
[5958.16 - 5962.16] P:1635.40 E:0.271027 |  Kelly Cates will be hosting from Red Square, Terry Butcher and Chris Sutton,
[5962.16 - 5964.16] P:1624.82 E:0.269655 |  and Chris Waddle all involved.
[5964.16 - 5968.16] P:1652.23 E:0.265665 |  Get in touch at Five Live Sport at BBC 6-06.
[5968.16 - 5970.16] P:1591.14 E:0.260161 |  Throw in for Columbia.
[5970.16 - 5972.16] P:1521.76 E:0.294596 |  Just waiting for that ball to go out with a minute.
[5972.16 - 5974.16] P:1711.77 E:0.227439 |  I don't think the ball's big enough.
[5974.16 - 5976.16] P:1748.74 E:0.288306 |  I think there's space.
[5976.16 - 5978.16] P:1659.67 E:0.311459 |  There could be three, numbers coming off.
[5978.16 - 5980.16] P:1650.46 E:0.265174 |  Three figures, you think. Could be here all night.
[5980.16 - 5982.16] P:1817.94 E:0.261077 |  I think it's five by the looks of it.
[5982.16 - 5984.16] P:1790.38 E:0.322422 |  Five, that's generous to England.
[5984.16 - 5986.16] P:1908.83 E:0.333788 |  Here come Columbia though.
[5986.16 - 5988.16] P:1763.63 E:0.302433 |  The ball's swinging by Mojica,
[5988.16 - 5990.16] P:1467.13 E:0.290534 |  and it's over everyone inside the England penalty area
[5990.16 - 5992.16] P:1539.04 E:0.293773 |  and will bounce out of play into the hoardings.
[5992.16 - 5994.16] P:1800.10 E:0.295279 |  And here now we see the fourth official,
[5994.16 - 5997.16] P:1776.95 E:0.271067 |  the New Zealander, Matt Conga,
[5997.16 - 6000.16] P:1786.85 E:0.292083 |  show everyone only five minutes of added time.
[6000.16 - 6003.16] P:1694.61 E:0.281322 |  And when you consider, as producer Gary handed the note,
[6003.16 - 6005.16] P:1599.38 E:0.335781 |  I think it was three and a half minutes,
[6005.16 - 6007.16] P:1898.75 E:0.275479 |  three and a half minutes between the penalty,
[6007.16 - 6010.16] P:1745.03 E:0.319404 |  the England penalty being awarded and it being taken.
[6010.16 - 6012.16] P:1677.60 E:0.303202 |  We've had all of the other various stoppages.
[6012.16 - 6014.16] P:1763.40 E:0.279749 |  We've had all of the yellow cards.
[6014.16 - 6016.16] P:1739.00 E:0.233291 |  Five minutes.
[6016.16 - 6018.16] P:1702.22 E:0.280766 |  Certainly doesn't add on all of the time.
[6018.16 - 6021.16] P:1728.33 E:0.332791 |  Then there's another foul England's way.
[6021.16 - 6025.16] P:1962.40 E:0.268329 |  And Jordan Henderson is caught again.
[6025.16 - 6029.16] P:1778.23 E:0.281670 |  He's had to spill a bit of blood tonight, Jordan Henderson.
[6029.16 - 6032.16] P:1772.63 E:0.288447 |  And he's still sitting on the pitch.
[6032.16 - 6036.16] P:1968.08 E:0.319116 |  The Colombian fans inside the stadium are enraged.
[6036.16 - 6041.16] P:1929.47 E:0.328261 |  In fact, someone's thrown a plastic cup of drink down from the stands.
[6041.16 - 6044.16] P:1987.69 E:0.300957 |  Doesn't reach the pitch, but there's frustration there.
[6044.16 - 6048.16] P:1920.07 E:0.278392 |  But, you know, they have lived in the stadium.
[6048.16 - 6053.16] P:1881.74 E:0.265789 |  You know, they have lived by the sword, so to speak.
[6053.16 - 6055.16] P:1674.65 E:0.303210 |  And they're dying by the sword.
[6055.16 - 6057.16] P:1653.45 E:0.254699 |  Well, it seems to progress like this.
[6057.16 - 6059.16] P:1630.14 E:0.281309 |  It's part of the tournament.
[6059.16 - 6061.16] P:1672.76 E:0.318145 |  If you're going to lose, yes, you don't like losing.
[6061.16 - 6063.16] P:1827.50 E:0.291318 |  Nobody does, but you can't conduct yourself
[6063.16 - 6065.16] P:1832.53 E:0.289576 |  the way they've done that tonight.
[6065.16 - 6070.16] P:1849.95 E:0.265383 |  We have already had a minute of the five to be played
[6070.16 - 6074.16] P:1772.71 E:0.285316 |  after a bad tempered, niggly, scrappy football match.
[6074.16 - 6077.16] P:1630.94 E:0.269616 |  England are very close now to a place in the quarter-finals.
[6077.16 - 6081.16] P:1568.84 E:0.283743 |  Against Sweden, which will be in Samara on Saturday afternoon.
[6081.16 - 6083.16] P:1644.07 E:0.263221 |  England playing it up to the edge of the penalty area.
[6083.16 - 6085.16] P:1310.84 E:0.273446 |  Davinson Sanchez heads it down.
[6085.16 - 6087.16] P:1703.07 E:0.304966 |  Harry Kane is there.
[6087.16 - 6089.16] P:1677.98 E:0.296833 |  Kane shoulder to shoulder with Arias.
[6089.16 - 6091.16] P:1737.17 E:0.295365 |  Arias gets a touch to it.
[6091.16 - 6093.16] P:1704.19 E:0.309000 |  In fact, it's a free kick given against Harry Kane.
[6093.16 - 6095.16] P:1936.38 E:0.296902 |  And then Harry Kane says the ball is...
[6095.16 - 6097.16] P:1791.39 E:0.341292 |  The free kick's been taken in the wrong place.
[6097.16 - 6100.16] P:1700.00 E:0.316665 |  I was worrying for a moment there that the referee was going to yellow card him.
[6100.16 - 6104.16] P:1794.85 E:0.298237 |  Then, Columbia has stolen five to six yards, more than that.
[6104.16 - 6106.16] P:1727.99 E:0.294517 |  Probably ten yards.
[6106.16 - 6107.16] P:1712.37 E:0.302370 |  He will take it though.
[6107.16 - 6108.16] P:1793.78 E:0.288172 |  Osbina will take it.
[6108.16 - 6111.16] P:1704.72 E:0.296518 |  He hits it long downfield for Columbia.
[6111.16 - 6113.16] P:1643.26 E:0.336970 |  The header is won for England by John Stones.
[6113.16 - 6115.16] P:1811.82 E:0.335922 |  It comes out a peeing shot!
[6115.16 - 6117.16] P:1781.04 E:0.371393 |  What a save by Jordan Pickford!
[6117.16 - 6122.16] P:1845.52 E:0.326676 |  What an effort that was by Uribe from 30 yards plus.
[6122.16 - 6126.16] P:1855.56 E:0.324191 |  And Pickford leaping to his left, got his fingertips to it
[6126.16 - 6129.16] P:1769.69 E:0.357175 |  and preserves England's lead by one hand.
[6129.16 - 6132.16] P:1873.99 E:0.329749 |  I don't know who's going in, John Boy. He didn't know that.
[6132.16 - 6134.16] P:1967.88 E:0.332885 |  Corner to Columbia.
[6134.16 - 6136.16] P:1804.18 E:0.320333 |  This is their first corner of the match.
[6136.16 - 6138.16] P:1915.93 E:0.302963 |  Osbina is coming up.
[6138.16 - 6140.16] P:1889.29 E:0.299338 |  We're in the third minute of added time.
[6140.16 - 6143.16] P:1865.47 E:0.312775 |  So many late goals at this World Cup.
[6143.16 - 6145.16] P:1818.06 E:0.278914 |  England have to defend this set piece.
[6145.16 - 6148.16] P:1857.49 E:0.338913 |  Here's the delivery, which is headed down by Mead O'Rean.
[6148.16 - 6152.16] P:1996.44 E:0.371510 |  Mead O'Rean has scored and he's equalised.
[6152.16 - 6154.16] P:1963.88 E:0.357743 |  And it's 1-1.
[6154.16 - 6156.16] P:1905.35 E:0.369251 |  In the third minute of added time,
[6156.16 - 6159.16] P:1904.64 E:0.353309 |  Columbia have levelled it.
[6159.16 - 6162.16] P:1803.71 E:0.342738 |  And we're heading to extra time.
[6162.16 - 6167.16] P:1834.07 E:0.346448 |  1-1. What a crushing, crushing blow for England.
[6167.16 - 6170.16] P:1846.47 E:0.342669 |  That quarter-final place has been snatched away
[6170.16 - 6172.16] P:1785.89 E:0.327941 |  for the time being, at least.
[6172.16 - 6175.16] P:1876.50 E:0.332882 |  I can't believe it.
[6175.16 - 6177.16] P:1627.24 E:0.358792 |  They've done their jobs of being good in eight England,
[6177.16 - 6179.16] P:1806.52 E:0.338843 |  well-disciplined, could have played better than I have,
[6179.16 - 6182.16] P:1716.40 E:0.358480 |  but they weren't allowed by a horrible Columbia side.
[6182.16 - 6184.16] P:1958.23 E:0.321681 |  But set piece.
[6184.16 - 6186.16] P:1777.26 E:0.345566 |  And it basically gets above...
[6186.16 - 6188.16] P:1863.34 E:0.332681 |  Oh, he gets above Stones.
[6188.16 - 6191.16] P:1825.91 E:0.337511 |  Stones was marking, he gets above McGuire.
[6191.16 - 6193.16] P:1783.03 E:0.344812 |  And he heads it down, spins up the set.
[6193.16 - 6195.16] P:1827.05 E:0.321679 |  He can't...
[6195.16 - 6197.16] P:1744.99 E:0.360188 |  Chupter on the lane, can't hit it off the lane.
[6197.16 - 6200.16] P:1760.64 E:0.316583 |  Pickford can't reach it.
[6200.16 - 6202.16] P:1744.53 E:0.325083 |  Oh, wow.
[6202.16 - 6205.16] P:1862.19 E:0.348765 |  Not a bad goal to give away.
[6205.16 - 6207.16] P:1929.28 E:0.338694 |  Set piece.
[6207.16 - 6209.16] P:1878.16 E:0.327420 |  England near the threat.
[6209.16 - 6211.16] P:1876.14 E:0.315938 |  Zool too obvious.
[6211.16 - 6214.16] P:1770.17 E:0.362663 |  Yerimina of Barcelona, who's already headed two goals
[6214.16 - 6217.16] P:1847.35 E:0.319351 |  from free kicks, or set pieces at this World Cup.
[6217.16 - 6219.16] P:1799.89 E:0.318230 |  Heads in a third. You put two on him.
[6219.16 - 6221.16] P:1645.33 E:0.342507 |  You know he's the main man who scores.
[6221.16 - 6223.16] P:1718.23 E:0.328891 |  They're still celebrating.
[6223.16 - 6225.16] P:1739.08 E:0.342186 |  I know he's still in the coats somewhere.
[6225.16 - 6227.16] P:1814.69 E:0.323017 |  They're still celebrating.
[6227.16 - 6229.16] P:1947.70 E:0.313962 |  I think he was sitting on the seats, wasn't he?
[6229.16 - 6231.16] P:1709.02 E:0.360880 |  But you know he's the man.
[6231.16 - 6233.16] P:1932.74 E:0.304565 |  So why didn't you put two on him?
[6233.16 - 6235.16] P:1807.98 E:0.309927 |  Two big lads, get on Dave.
[6235.16 - 6237.16] P:1823.08 E:0.299833 |  Enough to hate the team. Make sure he does not head it.
[6237.16 - 6239.16] P:1906.85 E:0.286521 |  Their first corner.
[6239.16 - 6241.16] P:1873.31 E:0.307452 |  They scored from their first corner over there.
[6241.16 - 6243.16] P:1863.80 E:0.299418 |  Like a concentration switched off.
[6243.16 - 6247.16] P:1928.59 E:0.291064 |  And they're still not back over the halfway lane.
[6247.16 - 6249.16] P:1796.90 E:0.288437 |  Just start the match again.
[6249.16 - 6252.16] P:1792.29 E:0.319316 |  I think we go straight to the airport when this finishes.
[6252.16 - 6255.16] P:1950.40 E:0.339080 |  And no plan was there, was there?
[6258.16 - 6260.16] P:1927.45 E:0.357702 |  So 1-1.
[6260.16 - 6262.16] P:1906.86 E:0.330295 |  Colombia won.
[6262.16 - 6264.16] P:1879.82 E:0.282701 |  England won.
[6264.16 - 6266.16] P:1817.71 E:0.344230 |  And we surely will have extra time.
[6266.16 - 6269.16] P:1822.20 E:0.309710 |  England pump it forward.
[6269.16 - 6273.16] P:1939.11 E:0.311248 |  And the ball bounces out of play next to the corner.
[6273.16 - 6275.16] P:1712.31 E:0.334833 |  You know what, John, as well,
[6275.16 - 6277.16] P:1812.66 E:0.318133 |  England's had some great moments in the second half.
[6277.16 - 6279.16] P:1824.52 E:0.307731 |  We're going to kill the game off.
[6279.16 - 6281.16] P:1911.54 E:0.324893 |  You know, Lingards, Sloppy pass.
[6281.16 - 6283.16] P:1830.09 E:0.319342 |  So and so Sloppy pass.
[6283.16 - 6286.16] P:1853.65 E:0.304522 |  They've had great chances to kill this game off.
[6287.16 - 6289.16] P:1908.66 E:0.337834 |  The ball with England on the right.
[6289.16 - 6291.16] P:1613.88 E:0.328319 |  Shibuya says there was a handball there.
[6291.16 - 6293.16] P:1914.10 E:0.294373 |  It's been cleared away downfield.
[6293.16 - 6296.16] P:1873.81 E:0.313655 |  I must say, in extra time here,
[6297.16 - 6300.16] P:1928.48 E:0.339584 |  who knows what's going to happen on the disciplinary front.
[6300.16 - 6302.16] P:1825.49 E:0.359539 |  You know, anything.
[6302.16 - 6304.16] P:1941.53 E:0.332852 |  You see goals, great cards.
[6304.16 - 6306.16] P:1835.28 E:0.353132 |  Don't switch your radio off.
[6306.16 - 6308.16] P:1946.50 E:0.350633 |  Anything's going to happen here.
[6308.16 - 6310.16] P:2020.19 E:0.336903 |  This could be a real thriller.
[6310.16 - 6312.16] P:2006.79 E:0.364660 |  And the atmosphere is brilliant.
[6312.16 - 6314.16] P:2012.55 E:0.344537 |  We're all of those Colombian fans.
[6314.16 - 6316.16] P:1979.28 E:0.357599 |  I think they're just about giving it up.
[6316.16 - 6318.16] P:1912.09 E:0.330039 |  But Mina scores in the third minute of out of time.
[6318.16 - 6320.16] P:2004.74 E:0.331548 |  And it's 1-1.
[6320.16 - 6322.16] P:1838.40 E:0.331648 |  And we've already now had five minutes.
[6322.16 - 6324.16] P:1907.84 E:0.301946 |  Five and a half minutes of out of time.
[6324.16 - 6326.16] P:1945.26 E:0.320571 |  Had five minutes of celebrations.
[6326.16 - 6329.16] P:1892.32 E:0.313653 |  Kane chasing the ball down into the dead ball position.
[6329.16 - 6331.16] P:1772.26 E:0.345819 |  It's headed away by Uribe.
[6331.16 - 6333.16] P:1908.23 E:0.283344 |  Uribe runs out to Daya.
[6333.16 - 6335.16] P:1856.25 E:0.279158 |  Daya lifted over the top.
[6335.16 - 6337.16] P:1728.83 E:0.329709 |  I thought that was a handball just outside the penalty area.
[6337.16 - 6339.16] P:1852.93 E:0.303303 |  But it's not.
[6339.16 - 6341.16] P:1797.38 E:0.296591 |  Then Maguire tests it down.
[6341.16 - 6343.16] P:1801.70 E:0.324362 |  Maguire's going to carry the ball forward.
[6343.16 - 6345.16] P:1814.77 E:0.339436 |  Tries to slip it through.
[6345.16 - 6347.16] P:1840.82 E:0.331527 |  But it's sliced away by Arias.
[6347.16 - 6349.16] P:1880.32 E:0.372389 |  Falcao gets a touch against Ashley Young.
[6349.16 - 6351.16] P:1917.32 E:0.345854 |  Ashley Young then falls into the path of Falcao.
[6351.16 - 6354.16] P:1832.33 E:0.326298 |  No free kick given because Colombia have the advantage with Cuadrado.
[6354.16 - 6356.16] P:1820.76 E:0.334138 |  Then Young puts in the challenge.
[6356.16 - 6358.16] P:1811.55 E:0.317453 |  And there's no free kick.
[6358.16 - 6360.16] P:1754.97 E:0.308655 |  He wasn't able to bring it back, the referee.
[6360.16 - 6362.16] P:1824.50 E:0.321957 |  But it's a way downfield.
[6362.16 - 6364.16] P:1761.94 E:0.308804 |  Six minutes of out of time.
[6364.16 - 6366.16] P:1883.31 E:0.332914 |  That's it.
[6366.16 - 6368.16] P:1879.38 E:0.358105 |  The final whistle goes.
[6368.16 - 6370.16] P:1835.44 E:0.333575 |  It is 1-1.
[6370.16 - 6372.16] P:1927.21 E:0.344987 |  And we will have extra time.
[6372.16 - 6374.16] P:1831.59 E:0.310101 |  And Yari Mina is headed.
[6374.16 - 6376.16] P:1812.46 E:0.337725 |  The 93rd minute has salvaged it.
[6376.16 - 6378.16] P:1888.96 E:0.306998 |  For the time being at least after Harry Kane
[6378.16 - 6380.16] P:1805.70 E:0.339206 |  with the penalty.
[6380.16 - 6382.16] P:1814.97 E:0.309683 |  They gave England the lead.
[6382.16 - 6384.16] P:1911.17 E:0.292609 |  And now England has got the dig deep again.
[6384.16 - 6386.16] P:1867.89 E:0.286128 |  So Colombia won.
[6386.16 - 6388.16] P:1746.85 E:0.316174 |  England won.
[6388.16 - 6390.16] P:1964.28 E:0.298898 |  And the penalty is over.
[6390.16 - 6392.16] P:1919.99 E:0.272749 |  They have a good hitting.
[6392.16 - 6394.16] P:1814.98 E:0.291829 |  It's just down to our right here.
[6394.16 - 6396.16] P:1889.55 E:0.317859 |  He looks as though he's enjoying it.
[6396.16 - 6398.16] P:1856.24 E:0.256602 |  Colombia are going to get the second.
[6398.16 - 6400.16] P:1897.37 E:0.300237 |  Get the first period of extra time underway.
[6400.16 - 6402.16] P:1810.73 E:0.268150 |  So now England have got to respond.
[6402.16 - 6404.16] P:1760.27 E:0.318404 |  One of those moments where
[6404.16 - 6406.16] P:1894.45 E:0.316148 |  that's when the manager,
[6406.16 - 6408.16] P:1831.66 E:0.306808 |  Harris Southgate, Steve Holland
[6408.16 - 6410.16] P:1815.07 E:0.320022 |  and his team can do their work.
[6410.16 - 6412.16] P:1910.59 E:0.305374 |  That's when they have to rebuild the belief.
[6412.16 - 6414.16] P:1887.13 E:0.293221 |  No further substitutions.
[6414.16 - 6416.16] P:1899.44 E:0.268689 |  No further substitutions.
[6416.16 - 6418.16] P:1886.99 E:0.280275 |  No further substitutions.
[6418.16 - 6420.16] P:1727.36 E:0.290938 |  Remember, each team can make
[6420.16 - 6422.16] P:1754.72 E:0.285511 |  an extra substitution in extra time.
[6422.16 - 6424.16] P:1719.31 E:0.337463 |  England have only used two so far.
[6424.16 - 6426.16] P:1643.16 E:0.315087 |  Chris Waddle.
[6426.16 - 6428.16] P:1988.72 E:0.271634 |  They have a 4 to put Quadrado in midfield.
[6428.16 - 6430.16] P:1860.24 E:0.300366 |  They are playing back now on the right.
[6430.16 - 6432.16] P:1878.26 E:0.308224 |  Yari will be on the left.
[6432.16 - 6434.16] P:1860.79 E:0.331903 |  So they are playing basically a 4-3-3.
[6434.16 - 6436.16] P:1999.17 E:0.305629 |  Their toes are up a bit now.
[6436.16 - 6438.16] P:1838.51 E:0.321352 |  They have got a bit of the crowds up.
[6438.16 - 6440.16] P:1939.25 E:0.302698 |  They have got that goal.
[6440.16 - 6442.16] P:1935.82 E:0.312583 |  England has got to stay calm and use the ball well.
[6442.16 - 6444.16] P:2004.03 E:0.238805 |  Peckford, who made a brilliant save.
[6444.16 - 6446.16] P:1903.15 E:0.258861 |  To keep it at 1-0.
[6446.16 - 6448.16] P:1810.83 E:0.266365 |  But then Columbia scored from the result in corner.
[6448.16 - 6450.16] P:1852.61 E:0.278131 |  There is Barrios and Jung going for a 50-50 together.
[6450.16 - 6452.16] P:1806.46 E:0.278280 |  And the whole of the Colombian
[6452.16 - 6454.16] P:1887.86 E:0.333129 |  bench have stepped forward
[6454.16 - 6456.16] P:1818.81 E:0.318845 |  because it happened in between
[6456.16 - 6458.16] P:1892.16 E:0.277165 |  the referee and the bench,
[6458.16 - 6460.16] P:1787.75 E:0.294888 |  clearly trying to influence the referee.
[6460.16 - 6462.16] P:1859.16 E:0.271364 |  Jung went into the challenge.
[6462.16 - 6464.16] P:1769.45 E:0.306886 |  Barrios is still on the ground.
[6464.16 - 6466.16] P:1807.95 E:0.262780 |  Well, he has caught him.
[6466.16 - 6468.16] P:1811.94 E:0.214713 |  Jung did catch him.
[6468.16 - 6470.16] P:1697.94 E:0.275048 |  He knows if he stands up,
[6470.16 - 6472.16] P:1569.89 E:0.234361 |  he's off.
[6472.16 - 6474.16] P:1607.78 E:0.286744 |  Jung did catch him.
[6474.16 - 6476.16] P:1663.42 E:0.273991 |  But he has gone in too footed.
[6476.16 - 6478.16] P:1584.15 E:0.288002 |  I wouldn't be surprised if that is shown.
[6478.16 - 6480.16] P:1843.43 E:0.177821 |  If that is referred.
[6480.16 - 6482.16] P:1724.87 E:0.314729 |  Jung is still on the ground.
[6482.16 - 6484.16] P:1828.81 E:0.298474 |  There is no indication that that is going to go
[6484.16 - 6486.16] P:1857.32 E:0.328771 |  to the video assistant referee.
[6486.16 - 6488.16] P:1866.96 E:0.319199 |  Look at that bench as well.
[6488.16 - 6490.16] P:1760.16 E:0.331218 |  England's bench.
[6490.16 - 6492.16] P:1731.69 E:0.336022 |  Look, can't see anybody.
[6492.16 - 6494.16] P:1932.88 E:0.318681 |  The whole squad, everybody is on the touchline.
[6494.16 - 6496.16] P:1779.92 E:0.342610 |  Telling it to referee.
[6496.16 - 6498.16] P:1750.27 E:0.327856 |  Jung's out there.
[6498.16 - 6500.16] P:1796.13 E:0.317938 |  He's got the ball.
[6500.16 - 6502.16] P:1858.62 E:0.336028 |  Jung's okay.
[6502.16 - 6504.16] P:1906.34 E:0.305723 |  He's on his feet.
[6504.16 - 6506.16] P:1850.72 E:0.317097 |  I think he might have feared the worst there,
[6506.16 - 6508.16] P:1917.51 E:0.299533 |  Ashley Jung.
[6508.16 - 6510.16] P:1881.00 E:0.334741 |  No action taken.
[6510.16 - 6512.16] P:1849.66 E:0.275555 |  Jung with the free kick.
[6512.16 - 6514.16] P:1551.06 E:0.335913 |  Hits it high into the Colombian penalty area.
[6514.16 - 6516.16] P:1699.12 E:0.291498 |  That's one area lead.
[6516.16 - 6518.16] P:1910.98 E:0.269150 |  One well actually as well.
[6518.16 - 6520.16] P:1960.37 E:0.370410 |  By goal scorer Nina.
[6520.16 - 6522.16] P:1898.84 E:0.316594 |  And now, Colombia
[6522.16 - 6524.16] P:1801.05 E:0.305057 |  are breaking away downfield
[6524.16 - 6526.16] P:1804.64 E:0.259052 |  of the left-hand side.
[6526.16 - 6528.16] P:1686.35 E:0.308223 |  And fortunately for England,
[6528.16 - 6530.16] P:1777.12 E:0.279201 |  they have a little bit of cramp
[6530.16 - 6532.16] P:1822.17 E:0.311509 |  from across and dis-possess.
[6532.16 - 6534.16] P:2003.89 E:0.227833 |  And then God must have run 50 yards here.
[6534.16 - 6536.16] P:1970.16 E:0.335556 |  Got a little bit of cramp.
[6536.16 - 6538.16] P:2035.34 E:0.293583 |  So now,
[6538.16 - 6540.16] P:2076.28 E:0.338514 |  Colombia
[6540.16 - 6542.16] P:2041.58 E:0.333970 |  have the ball.
[6542.16 - 6544.16] P:2066.82 E:0.326053 |  England have the ball.
[6544.16 - 6546.16] P:2042.26 E:0.320555 |  In front of their own penalty area.
[6546.16 - 6548.16] P:2046.25 E:0.331186 |  Colombia
[6548.16 - 6550.16] P:2047.01 E:0.306997 |  playing with Bacca
[6550.16 - 6552.16] P:2032.62 E:0.331765 |  out towards the right-hand side.
[6552.16 - 6554.16] P:2029.87 E:0.293288 |  Halkow through the middle.
[6554.16 - 6556.16] P:2014.23 E:0.308677 |  John Stones in possession
[6556.16 - 6558.16] P:2008.41 E:0.294335 |  of the ball.
[6558.16 - 6560.16] P:1881.64 E:0.309754 |  England were winning 1-0
[6560.16 - 6562.16] P:1981.78 E:0.266551 |  right until the 93rd minute
[6562.16 - 6564.16] P:1738.69 E:0.274095 |  when Yeri Nina
[6564.16 - 6566.16] P:1863.73 E:0.230693 |  headed the equaliser from a corner.
[6566.16 - 6568.16] P:1786.52 E:0.308590 |  Hard to work out with Colombia's playing.
[6568.16 - 6570.16] P:1721.25 E:0.270462 |  They've got a 4.
[6570.16 - 6572.16] P:1848.75 E:0.248165 |  They've got a 5.
[6572.16 - 6574.16] P:1816.04 E:0.299152 |  Very hard to work out with the playing.
[6574.16 - 6576.16] P:1736.98 E:0.306516 |  Bacca does seem to have come out to the right.
[6576.16 - 6578.16] P:1866.67 E:0.265042 |  Cuerrado is coming to the right now.
[6578.16 - 6580.16] P:1857.45 E:0.272602 |  And we've got 3.5.
[6580.16 - 6582.16] P:1802.94 E:0.239825 |  Cuerrado wins the header.
[6582.16 - 6584.16] P:1663.94 E:0.293259 |  Henderson gets there ahead of Bacca.
[6584.16 - 6586.16] P:1836.13 E:0.307662 |  Bacca's ball. Eric Dyer in with a challenge.
[6586.16 - 6588.16] P:1883.25 E:0.299767 |  That's a foul. Eric Dyer led with his shoulder.
[6588.16 - 6590.16] P:1898.32 E:0.269041 |  Free kick to Colombia.
[6590.16 - 6592.16] P:1818.76 E:0.288881 |  This is right in the balance.
[6592.16 - 6594.16] P:1840.59 E:0.255070 |  Bacca still on the ground.
[6594.16 - 6596.16] P:1735.64 E:0.269371 |  Hasn't got up yet.
[6596.16 - 6598.16] P:1853.80 E:0.323534 |  And the possibility of penalties
[6598.16 - 6600.16] P:1736.90 E:0.305916 |  obviously is now back on the agenda.
[6600.16 - 6602.16] P:1695.38 E:0.281363 |  Extra time.
[6602.16 - 6604.16] P:1802.20 E:0.289660 |  It is since the World Cup
[6604.16 - 6606.16] P:1725.45 E:0.293905 |  in 1966.
[6606.16 - 6608.16] P:1763.11 E:0.305344 |  This is now 8
[6608.16 - 6610.16] P:1879.39 E:0.292772 |  of 15 World Cup knockout matches
[6610.16 - 6612.16] P:1753.94 E:0.307234 |  involving England
[6612.16 - 6614.16] P:1831.90 E:0.294820 |  that have gone to extra time.
[6614.16 - 6616.16] P:1867.10 E:0.309910 |  8 out of 15.
[6616.16 - 6618.16] P:1856.67 E:0.341466 |  There is a trend there.
[6618.16 - 6620.16] P:1815.60 E:0.330376 |  The crows right behind them.
[6620.16 - 6622.16] P:1817.00 E:0.334772 |  All around the stadium.
[6622.16 - 6624.16] P:1724.32 E:0.334029 |  Supporters in Colombia's shirts are on their feet.
[6624.16 - 6626.16] P:1820.75 E:0.300223 |  Waving their flags
[6626.16 - 6628.16] P:1796.44 E:0.293413 |  and their shirts.
[6628.16 - 6630.16] P:1725.18 E:0.318332 |  The England supporters
[6630.16 - 6632.16] P:1801.33 E:0.292629 |  heavily outnumbered.
[6632.16 - 6634.16] P:1721.77 E:0.287521 |  And the atmosphere is strongly backing
[6634.16 - 6636.16] P:1763.58 E:0.261266 |  the South American team.
[6636.16 - 6638.16] P:1680.41 E:0.256693 |  One won the score. Bacca is OK.
[6638.16 - 6640.16] P:1700.12 E:0.282809 |  Ball swung out towards the right here
[6640.16 - 6642.16] P:1563.63 E:0.283772 |  for Colombia.
[6642.16 - 6644.16] P:1830.74 E:0.322676 |  He's headed away by Yung.
[6644.16 - 6646.16] P:1665.21 E:0.302121 |  He's headed straight to Cuadrado.
[6646.16 - 6648.16] P:1716.18 E:0.239564 |  He has Arias behind him.
[6648.16 - 6650.16] P:1727.86 E:0.258395 |  Back to Cuadrado.
[6650.16 - 6652.16] P:1799.43 E:0.312768 |  Back into his own half
[6652.16 - 6654.16] P:1766.13 E:0.299572 |  towards Colombia's goal scorer, Mina.
[6654.16 - 6656.16] P:1674.18 E:0.317515 |  Now across to Devenson Sanchez.
[6656.16 - 6658.16] P:1687.68 E:0.280974 |  Now to the left-hand side.
[6658.16 - 6660.16] P:1602.38 E:0.327015 |  Mojica goes for the early ball to the edge of the box.
[6660.16 - 6662.16] P:1875.35 E:0.244096 |  Stones.
[6662.16 - 6664.16] P:1729.42 E:0.300303 |  Readjusts, plays it away.
[6664.16 - 6666.16] P:1820.72 E:0.347935 |  Now Colombia comes through the middle with Falcao.
[6666.16 - 6668.16] P:1872.53 E:0.322861 |  Stones in with a challenge.
[6668.16 - 6670.16] P:1889.77 E:0.306558 |  But Stones continued his run.
[6670.16 - 6672.16] P:1779.01 E:0.312200 |  Was able to take the ball, run it away
[6672.16 - 6674.16] P:1785.22 E:0.315173 |  and pass it out of play down the right.
[6674.16 - 6676.16] P:1641.57 E:0.308192 |  And suddenly,
[6676.16 - 6678.16] P:1787.75 E:0.285703 |  Colombia are the team that we
[6678.16 - 6680.16] P:1835.93 E:0.291081 |  from an England point of view feared they might be tonight.
[6680.16 - 6682.16] P:1609.50 E:0.306451 |  Yeah, they look a little bit tired now
[6682.16 - 6684.16] P:1579.60 E:0.293046 |  and Colombia's getting tired on the ball.
[6684.16 - 6686.16] P:1776.05 E:0.295139 |  We know they can play.
[6686.16 - 6688.16] P:1783.51 E:0.220270 |  They haven't showed much of it today.
[6688.16 - 6690.16] P:1801.11 E:0.292449 |  Throw in Cuadrado.
[6690.16 - 6692.16] P:1727.42 E:0.319831 |  He's going to take it short.
[6692.16 - 6694.16] P:1832.65 E:0.285925 |  Now he's winding himself up.
[6694.16 - 6696.16] P:1717.13 E:0.317938 |  Once the run to the near post.
[6696.16 - 6698.16] P:1889.64 E:0.317464 |  Flick Don has gone a long way
[6698.16 - 6700.16] P:1707.17 E:0.293668 |  and it's hooked away by Lingard on the edge of the box.
[6700.16 - 6702.16] P:1720.37 E:0.325348 |  Bounces out of play for a throw on the pass.
[6702.16 - 6704.16] P:1675.10 E:0.320688 |  It's a little bit naive.
[6704.16 - 6706.16] P:1860.76 E:0.286026 |  You know it's coming at the box.
[6706.16 - 6708.16] P:1678.82 E:0.322923 |  Get one in front so it doesn't come through.
[6708.16 - 6710.16] P:1780.17 E:0.294908 |  There's no danger then. First man, Clearsie.
[6710.16 - 6712.16] P:1754.20 E:0.292813 |  There's a lot of tired legs out there.
[6712.16 - 6714.16] P:1648.67 E:0.311729 |  And Muriel, Luis Muriel,
[6714.16 - 6716.16] P:1623.07 E:0.312992 |  who's on the left-hand side.
[6716.16 - 6718.16] P:1849.81 E:0.269082 |  The severe man, he is a danger.
[6718.16 - 6720.16] P:1766.35 E:0.305368 |  So there's front line for Colombia.
[6720.16 - 6722.16] P:1690.89 E:0.270815 |  Muriel on the left, Falcao through the middle
[6722.16 - 6724.16] P:1791.65 E:0.292989 |  and Baccar on the right.
[6724.16 - 6726.16] P:1782.71 E:0.303834 |  Muriel down the left-hand side.
[6726.16 - 6728.16] P:1798.23 E:0.329164 |  It's taken on. A low cross to the near post.
[6728.16 - 6730.16] P:1822.77 E:0.325526 |  Pickford slides in and Pickford gathers it.
[6730.16 - 6732.16] P:1599.38 E:0.340097 |  Falcao is in there as well.
[6732.16 - 6734.16] P:1828.79 E:0.257694 |  Thought for a moment.
[6734.16 - 6736.16] P:1930.48 E:0.272531 |  It's Baccar who is going to get there first.
[6736.16 - 6738.16] P:1742.63 E:0.350328 |  He's back up. Slid in didn't he?
[6738.16 - 6740.16] P:1843.15 E:0.259263 |  Nearly got a touch on it.
[6740.16 - 6742.16] P:1926.39 E:0.247845 |  England.
[6742.16 - 6744.16] P:2047.49 E:0.309799 |  One-one.
[6744.16 - 6746.16] P:1992.99 E:0.355909 |  Obviously that was a blow.
[6746.16 - 6748.16] P:1981.45 E:0.325681 |  That was a severe blow that England took.
[6748.16 - 6750.16] P:2000.21 E:0.341272 |  And they haven't really recovered properly yet.
[6750.16 - 6752.16] P:2053.67 E:0.311005 |  Colombia are on top.
[6752.16 - 6754.16] P:1969.66 E:0.334568 |  As Chris Waddle says, their tails are up.
[6754.16 - 6756.16] P:1998.60 E:0.305637 |  6-0-6 will follow.
[6756.16 - 6760.16] P:2002.42 E:0.304236 |  Events are over here in the Spartak Moscow stadium.
[6760.16 - 6762.16] P:2057.24 E:0.307798 |  Lines are open.
[6762.16 - 6764.16] P:1974.68 E:0.314488 |  08, 08, 09, 09, 06, 09, 03.
[6764.16 - 6766.16] P:1934.02 E:0.312735 |  Eric Dias carrying the ball forward.
[6766.16 - 6768.16] P:1838.42 E:0.299303 |  Dias runs into yellow shirts
[6768.16 - 6770.16] P:1758.64 E:0.305145 |  and Colombia have it back.
[6770.16 - 6772.16] P:1853.07 E:0.267556 |  And now Lingard comes across.
[6772.16 - 6774.16] P:1738.00 E:0.241402 |  But it's played back by Muriel.
[6774.16 - 6776.16] P:1763.79 E:0.298850 |  Back into central.
[6776.16 - 6778.16] P:1777.52 E:0.290463 |  It's changed Johnny. Got one more sub left, haven't it?
[6778.16 - 6780.16] P:1777.86 E:0.273347 |  To put someone in and create something.
[6780.16 - 6782.16] P:1772.13 E:0.304382 |  We can make Nicky a goal.
[6782.16 - 6784.16] P:1899.95 E:0.236481 |  Like Rashford.
[6784.16 - 6786.16] P:1794.32 E:0.315796 |  Can he create it? Or do you just leave it?
[6786.16 - 6788.16] P:1786.68 E:0.292446 |  England have two actually. Two subs left.
[6788.16 - 6790.16] P:1796.35 E:0.289505 |  He can use it.
[6790.16 - 6792.16] P:1726.16 E:0.304773 |  One extra.
[6792.16 - 6794.16] P:1773.43 E:0.305139 |  He puts someone in with a bit of energy.
[6794.16 - 6796.16] P:1656.83 E:0.317073 |  Create something. That's a big problem in the squad.
[6796.16 - 6798.16] P:1834.15 E:0.277869 |  We haven't really got a great player.
[6798.16 - 6800.16] P:1843.78 E:0.330476 |  Colombia with the ball.
[6800.16 - 6802.16] P:1922.99 E:0.282762 |  Quadrado plays it up the Falcao.
[6802.16 - 6804.16] P:1922.23 E:0.301301 |  Who just scoops it out of play.
[6804.16 - 6806.16] P:1720.28 E:0.340789 |  So we'll bring in Terry Butcher from down at pitch level again.
[6806.16 - 6808.16] P:1848.11 E:0.289142 |  Terry.
[6808.16 - 6810.16] P:1778.11 E:0.359841 |  Marcus Rashford just warming up right in the corner.
[6810.16 - 6812.16] P:1924.33 E:0.325563 |  The end that Jordan Pickford is in goal.
[6812.16 - 6814.16] P:1908.47 E:0.355837 |  Just getting warmed up.
[6814.16 - 6816.16] P:1893.04 E:0.350579 |  He's not very energetic.
[6816.16 - 6818.16] P:1919.84 E:0.358936 |  And he's warmed up enough.
[6818.16 - 6820.16] P:1938.53 E:0.364319 |  So he's not going to come on just yet.
[6820.16 - 6822.16] P:1937.95 E:0.362724 |  But that's an option.
[6822.16 - 6824.16] P:1886.91 E:0.358443 |  If England want to really go for it and play three forwards.
[6824.16 - 6826.16] P:1912.38 E:0.344950 |  Unless you want to take Harry Kane off.
[6826.16 - 6828.16] P:2006.12 E:0.347917 |  I don't think you'll do that.
[6828.16 - 6830.16] P:1948.92 E:0.362259 |  The ball's off the field.
[6830.16 - 6832.16] P:1894.60 E:0.318901 |  Young's taking the throw.
[6832.16 - 6834.16] P:1881.82 E:0.338547 |  Maguire was looking the other way.
[6834.16 - 6836.16] P:1954.82 E:0.343086 |  And the referee has stopped play.
[6836.16 - 6838.16] P:1894.10 E:0.355544 |  They're putting the net by back out.
[6838.16 - 6840.16] P:1883.01 E:0.309800 |  But the referee had already blown the whistle.
[6840.16 - 6842.16] P:1787.32 E:0.320644 |  This was total confusion here.
[6842.16 - 6844.16] P:1907.68 E:0.274491 |  Because the ball was thrown on the pitch.
[6844.16 - 6846.16] P:1878.88 E:0.258033 |  There were two balls on the pitch.
[6846.16 - 6848.16] P:1857.60 E:0.263201 |  Ashley Young was waiting to take a throw.
[6848.16 - 6850.16] P:1833.48 E:0.298295 |  Harry Maguire knew there was a ball on the field.
[6850.16 - 6852.16] P:1828.73 E:0.258087 |  Turned his back.
[6852.16 - 6854.16] P:1862.18 E:0.254098 |  The ball was cleared off the field.
[6854.16 - 6856.16] P:1807.00 E:0.275222 |  Young took the throw while Harry Maguire
[6856.16 - 6858.16] P:1883.88 E:0.262768 |  was expecting that ball to be used for the throw.
[6858.16 - 6860.16] P:1907.16 E:0.259182 |  Look at that, by the way.
[6860.16 - 6862.16] P:1961.00 E:0.282292 |  Just a little.
[6862.16 - 6864.16] P:2033.24 E:0.275310 |  Because there was only one ball
[6864.16 - 6866.16] P:1994.83 E:0.318145 |  in play when the throw was taken
[6866.16 - 6868.16] P:2029.86 E:0.297588 |  by Ashley Young.
[6868.16 - 6870.16] P:2077.13 E:0.315553 |  There was confusion there.
[6870.16 - 6872.16] P:2017.78 E:0.332824 |  And that could have turned out
[6872.16 - 6874.16] P:2028.66 E:0.317306 |  very embarrassingly for Harry Maguire.
[6874.16 - 6876.16] P:1964.73 E:0.318300 |  But Maguire brings the ball forward.
[6876.16 - 6878.16] P:1987.79 E:0.303537 |  The score is still 1-1 in the first period
[6878.16 - 6880.16] P:1962.71 E:0.307904 |  of extra time here in Moscow.
[6880.16 - 6882.16] P:2013.89 E:0.276104 |  Vardy back towards Kane.
[6882.16 - 6884.16] P:2021.99 E:0.277208 |  Kane lifts it over the top through the middle.
[6884.16 - 6886.16] P:1838.84 E:0.300356 |  But beyond anyone in the red shirt.
[6886.16 - 6888.16] P:1895.70 E:0.308161 |  Don't force it. You've got Kerr-Walker to the right.
[6888.16 - 6890.16] P:1898.68 E:0.283562 |  Another pass out of Trippia.
[6890.16 - 6892.16] P:1817.74 E:0.307326 |  Me at these run, there's a lot of tail legs.
[6892.16 - 6894.16] P:1851.92 E:0.240624 |  Make them work.
[6896.16 - 6898.16] P:1920.93 E:0.294300 |  Spina still has the ball.
[6898.16 - 6900.16] P:1744.70 E:0.253022 |  And we've already had
[6900.16 - 6902.16] P:1771.32 E:0.307545 |  eight minutes of this first period of extra time.
[6904.16 - 6906.16] P:1822.84 E:0.264006 |  There's been so much talk, Chris,
[6906.16 - 6908.16] P:1769.16 E:0.301349 |  of penalties again.
[6908.16 - 6910.16] P:1783.48 E:0.262719 |  All year, really.
[6910.16 - 6912.16] P:1687.88 E:0.302421 |  I can't believe it's 1-1.
[6912.16 - 6914.16] P:1792.73 E:0.291241 |  I just cannot believe it.
[6914.16 - 6916.16] P:1793.69 E:0.318681 |  And we might be having the penalties again.
[6916.16 - 6918.16] P:1783.32 E:0.293705 |  Tickford out of his penalty area.
[6918.16 - 6920.16] P:1755.55 E:0.322205 |  They've done so much work.
[6920.16 - 6922.16] P:1780.58 E:0.303050 |  Gareth Southgate and his staff
[6922.16 - 6924.16] P:1896.84 E:0.218588 |  are trying to improve
[6924.16 - 6926.16] P:1769.79 E:0.321348 |  England's penalty record.
[6926.16 - 6928.16] P:1749.19 E:0.255298 |  But let's not get ahead of ourselves
[6928.16 - 6930.16] P:1591.56 E:0.286386 |  on that one.
[6930.16 - 6932.16] P:1796.40 E:0.284267 |  Because we still have...
[6932.16 - 6934.16] P:1829.64 E:0.304034 |  That's in the wrong one.
[6934.16 - 6936.16] P:1773.69 E:0.299086 |  Here is Clevenson Sanchez for Columbia.
[6938.16 - 6940.16] P:1781.71 E:0.305106 |  The way that the game is at the moment,
[6940.16 - 6942.16] P:1740.04 E:0.301960 |  it's entirely possible that Columbia
[6942.16 - 6944.16] P:1827.77 E:0.271105 |  could take a lead in this match.
[6944.16 - 6946.16] P:1825.19 E:0.286085 |  England are looking a little flat.
[6946.16 - 6948.16] P:1810.97 E:0.300348 |  And I think that thinking about making a change,
[6948.16 - 6950.16] P:1736.57 E:0.317019 |  John Stone's heading the ball away.
[6950.16 - 6952.16] P:1843.56 E:0.271888 |  I thought Bakker used his arm there.
[6952.16 - 6954.16] P:1891.36 E:0.273273 |  No three kick-givens.
[6954.16 - 6956.16] P:1877.93 E:0.293262 |  Taken on by Uribe,
[6956.16 - 6958.16] P:1858.93 E:0.244401 |  who is running across
[6958.16 - 6960.16] P:1845.05 E:0.254752 |  from left to right.
[6960.16 - 6962.16] P:1897.04 E:0.355276 |  But then Ashley Young is able to play the ball
[6962.16 - 6964.16] P:1809.96 E:0.347905 |  into Uribe out of play.
[6964.16 - 6966.16] P:1806.68 E:0.321786 |  They've got that late equaliser, John.
[6966.16 - 6968.16] P:1754.78 E:0.295477 |  They've got that extra bit of energy.
[6968.16 - 6970.16] P:1839.95 E:0.262651 |  And England look flat.
[6970.16 - 6972.16] P:1921.39 E:0.233320 |  Columbia won England 1.
[6972.16 - 6974.16] P:1892.14 E:0.229389 |  I think it's Danny Rose, you know.
[6974.16 - 6976.16] P:1806.10 E:0.325796 |  Yeah, Danny Rose is the one
[6976.16 - 6978.16] P:1825.64 E:0.316470 |  who's going to be called forward first.
[6978.16 - 6980.16] P:1935.63 E:0.316159 |  And remember, Ashley Young's still limping.
[6980.16 - 6982.16] P:1996.07 E:0.327937 |  Columbia can make one more change.
[6982.16 - 6984.16] P:2003.50 E:0.330931 |  England can make two more changes.
[6984.16 - 6986.16] P:2047.17 E:0.331357 |  Ball with Maguire.
[6986.16 - 6988.16] P:2027.18 E:0.298269 |  And then Dyer drops deep.
[6988.16 - 6990.16] P:2033.28 E:0.325962 |  Here's Young back to Dyer.
[6990.16 - 6992.16] P:2017.85 E:0.347822 |  I think it's fast for Young.
[6992.16 - 6994.16] P:1962.01 E:0.349160 |  He doesn't look care-right where he's walking.
[6994.16 - 6996.16] P:1985.80 E:0.284120 |  He's got a slight limp there.
[6996.16 - 6998.16] P:2013.93 E:0.317347 |  And there's no hot-bait.
[6998.16 - 7000.16] P:1936.27 E:0.288611 |  Stones, passes it up towards Lingard.
[7000.16 - 7002.16] P:1920.33 E:0.293517 |  But Lingard was beaten to it.
[7002.16 - 7004.16] P:1813.25 E:0.303348 |  And now Falcao plays it to the left-hand side
[7004.16 - 7006.16] P:1815.15 E:0.306244 |  and Luis Muriel is taking it on.
[7006.16 - 7008.16] P:1788.13 E:0.271026 |  Luis Muriel back onto his right foot.
[7008.16 - 7010.16] P:1834.49 E:0.217803 |  He has support behind him.
[7010.16 - 7012.16] P:1842.80 E:0.247655 |  And Mojica
[7012.16 - 7014.16] P:1790.91 E:0.287781 |  rolls it all the way back towards the halfway line.
[7014.16 - 7016.16] P:1728.22 E:0.301979 |  Now it finds its way over here to the right-hand side.
[7016.16 - 7018.16] P:1629.60 E:0.294497 |  To Arias.
[7018.16 - 7020.16] P:1861.87 E:0.254371 |  Arias pushes it off
[7020.16 - 7022.16] P:1875.13 E:0.289508 |  to Quadrado.
[7022.16 - 7024.16] P:1785.25 E:0.325813 |  Quadrado, that's a good-looking delivery.
[7024.16 - 7026.16] P:1674.31 E:0.321091 |  And it's headed down, but well-wide of the goal.
[7026.16 - 7028.16] P:1938.63 E:0.284761 |  Well-wide of the goal.
[7028.16 - 7030.16] P:1947.46 E:0.339773 |  Horner from back up.
[7030.16 - 7032.16] P:1884.79 E:0.348218 |  And it did take an afflection in.
[7032.16 - 7034.16] P:1850.01 E:0.313151 |  There's a corner to Columbia.
[7034.16 - 7036.16] P:1841.75 E:0.323005 |  Danger here, then, for England.
[7036.16 - 7038.16] P:1996.12 E:0.319071 |  Columbia scored
[7038.16 - 7040.16] P:1874.78 E:0.326168 |  from their only previous corner
[7040.16 - 7042.16] P:1887.18 E:0.290243 |  in the match.
[7042.16 - 7044.16] P:1843.19 E:0.307265 |  I'll put two on him, mate.
[7044.16 - 7046.16] P:1882.55 E:0.275490 |  Put two on him. Don't let him have it.
[7046.16 - 7048.16] P:1854.36 E:0.289680 |  Don't let him have it.
[7048.16 - 7050.16] P:1833.37 E:0.329427 |  Corner to be taken again by Quadrado.
[7050.16 - 7052.16] P:1873.64 E:0.269757 |  This is the old routine.
[7052.16 - 7054.16] P:1716.46 E:0.352841 |  Everyone knows about it here at the World Cup.
[7054.16 - 7056.16] P:1925.04 E:0.260798 |  But stopping it
[7056.16 - 7058.16] P:1848.66 E:0.284869 |  has proved
[7058.16 - 7060.16] P:1888.04 E:0.285798 |  impossible.
[7060.16 - 7062.16] P:1835.95 E:0.305510 |  Falcao is pulling
[7062.16 - 7064.16] P:1757.60 E:0.307676 |  Davinson Sanchez away from the England defence.
[7064.16 - 7066.16] P:1797.41 E:0.303002 |  Here's the delivery towards Mina.
[7066.16 - 7068.16] P:1709.98 E:0.316416 |  And it's headed wide by Davinson Sanchez,
[7068.16 - 7070.16] P:1765.02 E:0.308832 |  who actually got in the way of Mina.
[7070.16 - 7072.16] P:1686.52 E:0.255928 |  Headed it wide.
[7072.16 - 7074.16] P:1829.32 E:0.296830 |  That was good news. He got in the way.
[7074.16 - 7076.16] P:1696.06 E:0.308234 |  He has the substitution.
[7076.16 - 7078.16] P:1586.74 E:0.311743 |  And it is Ashley Young being replaced by Danny Rose.
[7078.16 - 7080.16] P:1906.26 E:0.276603 |  Terry Butcher.
[7080.16 - 7082.16] P:1876.99 E:0.359710 |  Yeah, well, the corner came over. I watched Mina because he's marked by Harry McGuire.
[7082.16 - 7084.16] P:1988.88 E:0.323274 |  And he goes back, right in the back post,
[7084.16 - 7086.16] P:1985.28 E:0.321431 |  well past the back post.
[7086.16 - 7088.16] P:2031.21 E:0.329615 |  As the delivery is coming in, it's an out-swinger.
[7088.16 - 7090.16] P:2007.19 E:0.334962 |  He then goes towards the palace,
[7090.16 - 7092.16] P:2000.33 E:0.348536 |  but away from goal, loses Harry McGuire.
[7092.16 - 7094.16] P:1998.34 E:0.315998 |  And, unfortunately, one of his players gets in the way.
[7094.16 - 7096.16] P:1951.11 E:0.318051 |  Doesn't get a clean header, but flashes it wide.
[7096.16 - 7098.16] P:1959.10 E:0.317054 |  I think Chris is right.
[7098.16 - 7100.16] P:1952.48 E:0.311881 |  They've got to put two men in one in front, one slightly behind.
[7100.16 - 7102.16] P:1966.77 E:0.308514 |  You try and squeeze him out of that space
[7102.16 - 7104.16] P:1864.30 E:0.324484 |  because he is a real, real danger.
[7104.16 - 7106.16] P:1995.11 E:0.257334 |  Columbia won, England won.
[7106.16 - 7108.16] P:1962.78 E:0.300465 |  As Ashley Young is
[7108.16 - 7110.16] P:1923.24 E:0.257547 |  embraced by Garrel Southgate,
[7110.16 - 7112.16] P:1766.99 E:0.316800 |  who slaps him on the back,
[7112.16 - 7114.16] P:1763.00 E:0.285737 |  and Danny Rose steps into
[7114.16 - 7116.16] P:1804.98 E:0.274378 |  this World Cup round of 16 match.
[7116.16 - 7118.16] P:1873.69 E:0.284669 |  To win his 21st cap.
[7118.16 - 7120.16] P:1880.96 E:0.284662 |  Chris,
[7120.16 - 7122.16] P:1926.01 E:0.275569 |  England brought on Jamie Vardy in the latter parts of the match.
[7122.16 - 7124.16] P:1810.97 E:0.300487 |  No.
[7124.16 - 7126.16] P:1913.17 E:0.289376 |  They'd love to have Rashford on the field, wouldn't they?
[7126.16 - 7128.16] P:1843.85 E:0.310816 |  I would rather have Rashford on,
[7128.16 - 7130.16] P:1936.17 E:0.314199 |  but Jamie Vardy was brought on
[7130.16 - 7132.16] P:1971.96 E:0.316493 |  because they were throwing everything at England,
[7132.16 - 7134.16] P:1976.97 E:0.313916 |  Columbia, and there was space.
[7134.16 - 7136.16] P:1976.10 E:0.312413 |  And you thought, well,
[7136.16 - 7138.16] P:2016.14 E:0.315728 |  with a counterattack ideal for Vardy,
[7138.16 - 7140.16] P:2063.91 E:0.295647 |  one ball, he's down the side, he's away.
[7140.16 - 7142.16] P:2005.86 E:0.315870 |  England scored, now they've dropped off defensively.
[7142.16 - 7144.16] P:2045.34 E:0.317132 |  Vardy's got no space.
[7144.16 - 7146.16] P:2071.00 E:0.306890 |  And the Ains,
[7146.16 - 7148.16] P:2020.73 E:0.317878 |  yes, in Ainside, Rashford would have been a better change.
[7148.16 - 7150.16] P:2002.01 E:0.317053 |  But this can still make one change.
[7150.16 - 7152.16] P:1895.52 E:0.319596 |  I would look at it, because if you want to go in the game,
[7152.16 - 7154.16] P:1861.89 E:0.318777 |  a minute, there's a lot of tail legs out there.
[7154.16 - 7156.16] P:1908.00 E:0.307326 |  Columbia's being spread on by this crowd,
[7156.16 - 7158.16] P:1900.08 E:0.291981 |  which is a lot of yellow shirts.
[7158.16 - 7160.16] P:1944.24 E:0.299546 |  Another free kick.
[7160.16 - 7162.16] P:1805.47 E:0.299128 |  Free kick, we are in the 13th minute
[7162.16 - 7164.16] P:1720.40 E:0.305979 |  of the first period of extra time.
[7164.16 - 7166.16] P:1820.03 E:0.269708 |  The 103rd minute of this match.
[7166.16 - 7168.16] P:1679.73 E:0.269275 |  Columbia won, England won,
[7168.16 - 7170.16] P:1727.97 E:0.275125 |  and a free kick after Mojica was
[7170.16 - 7172.16] P:1705.94 E:0.277943 |  bundled over by Lingard,
[7172.16 - 7174.16] P:1752.88 E:0.288955 |  which is one of the England players
[7174.16 - 7176.16] P:1771.53 E:0.312174 |  on a yellow card in this match,
[7176.16 - 7178.16] P:1782.09 E:0.336273 |  Lingard and Henderson.
[7178.16 - 7180.16] P:1963.37 E:0.306264 |  One-one.
[7180.16 - 7182.16] P:1878.50 E:0.347165 |  Columbia
[7184.16 - 7186.16] P:1821.99 E:0.342693 |  being loudly back
[7186.16 - 7188.16] P:1705.76 E:0.356884 |  by their many thousands of supporters
[7188.16 - 7190.16] P:1773.83 E:0.334735 |  here in Moscow.
[7190.16 - 7192.16] P:1853.85 E:0.339032 |  And here they are with the ball on the left-hand side,
[7192.16 - 7194.16] P:1642.81 E:0.355448 |  Mojica with a cross, Falka with a header,
[7194.16 - 7196.16] P:1776.17 E:0.317191 |  but he's headed it wide.
[7196.16 - 7198.16] P:1630.37 E:0.330552 |  He was in between McGuire and Stones,
[7198.16 - 7200.16] P:1672.79 E:0.319953 |  and he headed it wide, and he holds his head.
[7200.16 - 7202.16] P:1632.01 E:0.320564 |  It's all about who has come out,
[7202.16 - 7204.16] P:1669.01 E:0.288582 |  or has in Columbia,
[7204.16 - 7206.16] P:1666.23 E:0.326833 |  who have sort of up the gears.
[7206.16 - 7208.16] P:1600.77 E:0.309228 |  England have come right off the pace.
[7208.16 - 7210.16] P:1729.06 E:0.304189 |  It's not one or two plays,
[7210.16 - 7212.16] P:1745.91 E:0.312525 |  it's about a nine have come right off the pace.
[7212.16 - 7214.16] P:1792.60 E:0.308736 |  And Arrimeguia giving credit,
[7214.16 - 7216.16] P:1683.76 E:0.300549 |  just puts Falka off,
[7216.16 - 7218.16] P:1912.28 E:0.294935 |  if he goes ahead just nudges him,
[7218.16 - 7220.16] P:1966.84 E:0.328132 |  and he heads it wide,
[7220.16 - 7222.16] P:1803.10 E:0.333518 |  but it's all Columbia at the minute.
[7222.16 - 7224.16] P:1745.54 E:0.302265 |  Columbia won,
[7224.16 - 7226.16] P:1731.66 E:0.316401 |  England won, this is all happening,
[7226.16 - 7228.16] P:1933.61 E:0.333942 |  England, depending at your end
[7228.16 - 7232.36] P:1963.30 E:0.367051 |  Cross KML couldn't watch where Falco's header went because the England back three all over the shop
[7232.36 - 7236.64] P:2038.41 E:0.353955 |  Falco gets in between John Stones and Harry McGuire. John Stones doesn't do anything about it.
[7236.64 - 7242.80] P:1923.06 E:0.312587 |  Harry McGuire comes across too late. Free header. He's a small man Falco. If he puts that on target that could have been 2-1
[7242.80 - 7246.28] P:1735.53 E:0.286236 |  They've got a the concentration levels got to be higher. It's got to be higher.
[7246.28 - 7248.28] P:1835.88 E:0.290011 |  Do you know what I say the Italian it went?
[7248.84 - 7251.12] P:1896.79 E:0.305079 |  When you're tired concentration levels drop
[7251.80 - 7255.24] P:1805.41 E:0.319779 |  And there's a lot of tired mains out and legs out there
[7255.52 - 7259.88] P:1835.15 E:0.325525 |  Yeah, but the one the team with the most concentration will win this match because we know that and it's got to be
[7259.88 - 7261.08] P:1876.52 E:0.332407 |  It's got to be
[7261.08 - 7263.08] P:1966.11 E:0.329861 |  It doesn't look like it was at the minute
[7263.08 - 7267.68] P:1819.68 E:0.349802 |  No, Terry Vulture and Chris Waddle with us on five live World Cup semi-finalists with England both
[7268.04 - 7273.44] P:1766.51 E:0.305793 |  And now England were seconds away really from a quarter-final here in Russia
[7273.68 - 7278.40] P:1636.96 E:0.304746 |  Now suddenly the semi-final possibility of that feels like a long way away
[7278.92 - 7283.42] P:1796.62 E:0.308131 |  One won the score and Columbia sweeping forward again in the yellow shirts back
[7283.42 - 7287.16] P:1827.57 E:0.299922 |  I turns and gives it to Falco who's on his left foot outside the D
[7287.16 - 7291.52] P:1805.01 E:0.304170 |  He gives it to Mojica on the left hand side yellow shirts are plenty in the box
[7291.52 - 7296.36] P:1814.16 E:0.290918 |  Oh, that's an awful cross from Mojica and it bounces straight out of play beyond everyone and
[7296.92 - 7301.16] P:1781.57 E:0.310157 |  Falco puts his hands on his hips in the penalty area in desperation
[7301.92 - 7305.24] P:1747.80 E:0.299805 |  Do you want to know themselves? They didn't leave 12 on did they come beyond?
[7305.56 - 7309.68] P:1845.88 E:0.318192 |  They just seem to be dominating the game in England just have got where's everybody gone
[7309.84 - 7313.88] P:1914.38 E:0.311724 |  This is all what he gets on the ball apart on the back three and they're giving it away cheaply
[7314.24 - 7317.80] P:1895.27 E:0.327879 |  But mean as equalizer was was a real
[7319.00 - 7322.36] P:1908.09 E:0.319445 |  stunning blow that that flawed England and lifted
[7322.68 - 7326.60] P:1933.43 E:0.316890 |  Columbia so much and then a crossfield pass straight out of play from
[7326.96 - 7334.52] P:1802.39 E:0.285853 |  Eric Dyer throwing to Columbia half way inside their own half for an added time at the end of the first period of extra time
[7336.16 - 7338.16] P:1887.97 E:0.313555 |  I
[7338.16 - 7344.96] P:1774.61 E:0.286300 |  Pacaman the coach who led Columbia to the quarter finals four years ago in Brazil when they when they did so well and
[7344.96 - 7348.72] P:1760.81 E:0.305513 |  Entertain us so much walk out under pressure from Muriel
[7349.92 - 7354.92] P:1806.04 E:0.299191 |  Now trip yet back to walk out England don't want to make mistakes here and then trip
[7354.92 - 7358.84] P:1756.93 E:0.315596 |  He has actually been caught late by Muriel who is
[7359.48 - 7364.12] P:1836.12 E:0.305510 |  Stalked across and is leaning over trip. Yeah, and it's obviously giving him a piece of his mind
[7364.64 - 7368.16] P:1807.82 E:0.270639 |  Kiran Trippier gets up and he's smiling at him
[7368.80 - 7373.60] P:1795.84 E:0.294869 |  Yeah, he is but it just shows you didn't touch him and did he look he doesn't so
[7374.92 - 7376.92] P:1847.55 E:0.313666 |  He's rolling around
[7376.92 - 7380.44] P:1720.16 E:0.317383 |  Trippie has made and we did we did all that teams out. That's terrible
[7381.64 - 7385.00] P:1919.78 E:0.299247 |  Free kick to England pick fit to hit it downfield
[7386.68 - 7389.96] P:1870.84 E:0.318550 |  Whistle will be going very shortly as Vardy heads the ball on
[7390.76 - 7397.48] P:1855.30 E:0.302349 |  Straight through for a little kick and that is half time in extra time Columbia one England one and let's bring Mark Chapman in again
[7400.24 - 7402.24] P:1830.75 E:0.279743 |  At the moment with England
[7402.60 - 7405.48] P:1760.68 E:0.295584 |  You think now they almost would take penalties
[7405.88 - 7411.20] P:1772.05 E:0.306706 |  Because Columbia are on top and they've just gone into a huddle England have been ready for some little while and noticed that
[7411.20 - 7414.92] P:1890.13 E:0.298718 |  Hamas Rodriguez actually who's not involved injured not involved tonight has
[7415.64 - 7421.40] P:1862.44 E:0.299975 |  Actually came on to the field and joined in and in the goal to our right at Terry's end one of the assistants
[7421.40 - 7424.40] P:1814.35 E:0.280053 |  I don't know whether some netting had come loose, but they seem to
[7425.16 - 7428.00] P:1758.93 E:0.284717 |  Be giving that some attention and putting that right
[7428.52 - 7429.80] P:1888.20 E:0.262304 |  Chris Waddle
[7429.80 - 7432.92] P:1712.78 E:0.330879 |  Just as I said, I'm looking for England yet to turn raise the tempo
[7433.32 - 7436.08] P:1740.30 E:0.301354 |  Got 15 minutes they can still win the game in this team
[7436.08 - 7438.16] P:1910.93 E:0.282590 |  But we've got to pick it up
[7438.16 - 7441.28] P:1874.97 E:0.311163 |  They've just dropped right off the pace and the letting come from the acumen to them
[7441.48 - 7446.80] P:1919.42 E:0.295593 |  Kane heads it down to Lingard Lingard hits the shot Henderson talks it forward chance for Vardy
[7447.00 - 7455.28] P:1830.58 E:0.297241 |  Shoot straight at Osbina and he was in an offside position good start simple kickoff back to John Stones long bit of panic there in the
[7455.28 - 7460.00] P:1757.63 E:0.285846 |  Columbian defense drops to Vardy. Yeah, and he's a good yard two yards offside
[7462.20 - 7466.92] P:1738.99 E:0.302855 |  Hit it straight at Osbina took it well to his left actually just just to his left
[7467.84 - 7470.84] P:1727.39 E:0.307882 |  catch Columbia one England one
[7472.28 - 7476.92] P:1797.08 E:0.290695 |  So first minute of the second period of extra time
[7477.72 - 7478.64] P:1721.70 E:0.284457 |  Columbia
[7478.64 - 7485.64] P:1782.00 E:0.292773 |  The best period of the match was in that first 15 minutes of extra time having scored the equalizer in the third minute
[7485.64 - 7488.04] P:1794.33 E:0.257361 |  I've added time at the end of the 90
[7488.72 - 7491.44] P:1714.21 E:0.304384 |  Muriel over hits the ball down the left straight out of play
[7491.80 - 7494.76] P:1768.51 E:0.299307 |  Mujica can't keep it in throwing to England England all in red
[7494.76 - 7500.36] P:1824.52 E:0.270002 |  They're playing from left to right now in this period of extra time Columbia yellow shirts with the
[7501.40 - 7503.40] P:1896.70 E:0.282189 |  blue and red
[7503.40 - 7504.72] P:1952.89 E:0.338233 |  Columbian trim
[7504.72 - 7510.00] P:1923.78 E:0.311326 |  The throwing taken by Trippier and Stones played it back to him. That's and they've conceded a free kick
[7510.00 - 7513.76] P:1758.97 E:0.293495 |  That's a bad air out in throwing throwing rather. That's a bad error
[7514.24 - 7520.80] P:1787.90 E:0.298719 |  Like a concentration that is symptomatic of the way that England are just now. They're in trouble here England
[7522.60 - 7524.60] P:1853.34 E:0.275406 |  throwing taken and
[7525.32 - 7527.32] P:1818.05 E:0.302198 |  Mojica takes it on down the left-hand side
[7527.88 - 7530.44] P:1735.73 E:0.296893 |  Columbia have new energy in this match Uribe
[7530.96 - 7533.32] P:1795.81 E:0.281634 |  Plays it back towards Davinson Sanchez
[7533.92 - 7538.24] P:1644.32 E:0.299167 |  Quadrados available on the far side if they want to use him Davinson Sanchez passes it forward to Daya
[7538.24 - 7544.04] P:1792.24 E:0.293380 |  Daya got a foot in Kane will play it over the top for Vardy to chase stretched by Davinson Sanchez to get his head to it
[7544.04 - 7546.04] P:1644.37 E:0.326425 |  Right idea
[7546.04 - 7550.76] P:1840.89 E:0.296405 |  Arias to Osbina who's able to control it on his right foot falls as he clears it
[7550.76 - 7554.12] P:1880.02 E:0.310194 |  Kane's giving it back to Lingard Goldstitch go keep us still on the ground
[7554.12 - 7558.54] P:1887.01 E:0.306653 |  Vardy could be in shot is blocked by Barry or so did a great job actually to cover
[7558.76 - 7562.60] P:1784.29 E:0.298879 |  Jamie Vardy and block his shot from the angle. I don't know what Jamie Vardy had in his mind
[7562.60 - 7566.40] P:1739.61 E:0.281275 |  He didn't know where the cross is or shoot and he made the wrong decision
[7566.40 - 7571.32] P:1816.20 E:0.298982 |  But also how long did it take David Osbina to get back into his goal?
[7571.40 - 7578.28] P:1893.08 E:0.318163 |  Ball played over the top by Bacca and this is for Falcao to chase but Pickford got there first outside the penalty area
[7578.28 - 7580.28] P:1776.48 E:0.298803 |  Planted it into the stand
[7580.72 - 7584.56] P:1769.89 E:0.307224 |  Stalker maybe looking about stones is become a liability at the minute and
[7584.96 - 7587.96] P:1715.30 E:0.293319 |  We'll be looking at that. He's the spearman at the back in the middle
[7589.48 - 7594.16] P:1810.62 E:0.297173 |  England something away Danny Rose the substitute Jamie Vardy plays it around the defender
[7594.16 - 7597.44] P:1963.16 E:0.315905 |  But plays it's played out of play John Stones has become a liability
[7597.68 - 7602.68] P:1867.04 E:0.322577 |  Well, he's give the ball away there Falco got ahead of him in the box that way. He's had a word with him in the
[7603.28 - 7608.88] P:1793.03 E:0.288412 |  Change around there is fall asleep as a board gets played over the top pick that comes out and clear as it
[7609.36 - 7616.40] P:1791.88 E:0.295361 |  Garry Southgate and Steve Hollander in discussions together just in front of the blue top England dugout down to our right the score
[7616.40 - 7619.96] P:1820.97 E:0.263231 |  Columbia 1 England 1 penalties are
[7620.96 - 7626.88] P:1841.87 E:0.305243 |  Approaching they are 12 minutes away England who've lost six out of seven penalty shootouts
[7627.84 - 7632.52] P:1842.08 E:0.301320 |  World Cup and European Championship finals over the years throwing for
[7633.20 - 7635.20] P:1893.91 E:0.266018 |  Columbia and
[7635.28 - 7641.60] P:1746.57 E:0.287744 |  Rebate plays it through the inside left position, but couldn't find the ball to Muriel and Pickford has it in his hands
[7643.44 - 7645.64] P:1876.72 E:0.326823 |  I don't know if start keeping in now about mistakes and
[7647.16 - 7650.80] P:2059.37 E:0.331569 |  You know anything can happen is to say or there's a seven eight minutes left
[7652.32 - 7656.64] P:2043.28 E:0.327366 |  Back in your World Cup famously at this stage of the competition
[7657.76 - 7662.40] P:1946.85 E:0.319402 |  England won against Belgium with a very late goal in extra time scored by David Platt
[7663.72 - 7667.92] P:1847.58 E:0.308492 |  England are up against it here now in this match as it's sent forward towards Jamie Vardy
[7669.72 - 7673.88] P:1794.94 E:0.304072 |  Meena missed his clearance and was rather fortunate there that he got a second chance
[7674.12 - 7679.70] P:1712.24 E:0.286597 |  But he took a second chance up towards Falco. That's a lurking danger if ever I saw one Falco
[7680.22 - 7686.42] P:1808.46 E:0.291503 |  Also ball forward from Barry Ross and now Vardy chases a ball down the left-hand side takes on me
[7686.42 - 7691.60] P:1833.24 E:0.327179 |  That's Vardy using his pace story might have been tripped there by Arias. Nope. No free kick given
[7691.74 - 7696.06] P:1937.24 E:0.298958 |  So Columbia are in possession Vardy pulls himself back to his feet
[7696.74 - 7700.14] P:1773.20 E:0.292258 |  All up towards Falco. That's one by Harry Maguire in the air
[7700.34 - 7706.38] P:1847.92 E:0.285297 |  Lingard heads it on Hedder Henderson little header back towards Lin guard now Kyle Walker
[7706.38 - 7713.30] P:2033.81 E:0.310292 |  We'll take it on over the halfway line for England Walker stands up with the challenge Walker then throws himself to the ground
[7714.98 - 7716.98] P:1984.13 E:0.322605 |  Crump and has cramped
[7717.02 - 7725.42] P:1868.86 E:0.292575 |  Throwing to Columbia the referee just checking with Kyle Walker Columbia putting the ball out of play so it can bring in Terry Butcher again Terry
[7727.26 - 7732.62] P:1895.38 E:0.317119 |  Marcus Rashford again 15 yards away from in the corner and I think they'll be looking at a substitution there
[7732.62 - 7735.38] P:1904.54 E:0.281300 |  Maybe go to a back four and bring on Rashford
[7735.38 - 7741.06] P:1931.83 E:0.284224 |  We've got the two strikers of course with Kane and with Vardy maybe Rashford on the left-hand side of midfield
[7741.38 - 7747.36] P:1937.11 E:0.289067 |  In that four, but then they might do that to try and just tighten things up as and just have another body in there
[7747.36 - 7750.82] P:1848.76 E:0.283481 |  Another attacking body in there as well. Yeah, there is one way as
[7751.34 - 7756.10] P:1892.59 E:0.303979 |  Lindar plays it to Kane and then Kane slips a ball forward to Vardy who crosses
[7756.10 - 7760.24] P:1792.52 E:0.292277 |  Would took it a flexion and went a long way the Barrios was able to
[7760.90 - 7764.14] P:1764.03 E:0.310679 |  Half-full it out of play for a throw down the left Columbia have come off the pace now
[7764.14 - 7767.86] P:1790.57 E:0.301926 |  I think they're feeling it pace-wise and England's starting to come back into the game
[7767.86 - 7776.22] P:1922.78 E:0.301102 |  It's 1-1 BBC 5 lives 6 0 6 to follow oh 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 England with Maguire Maguire through to Lin guard
[7776.22 - 7777.38] P:1818.72 E:0.281607 |  It's bangstoff Lin guard
[7777.38 - 7782.32] P:1772.82 E:0.289591 |  It's rattling around on the edge of the Colombian penalty area and then Muriel comes out with the ball
[7782.40 - 7787.74] P:1842.52 E:0.282139 |  England could be stretched here, but stones is able to step forward and just pass it away to Jordan Henderson
[7787.74 - 7793.76] P:1829.66 E:0.311639 |  Henderson going around the outside of Muriel down the left and then Muriel recovers and slides in good challenge puts it out for a
[7793.76 - 7795.76] P:1929.35 E:0.285913 |  Throw to England
[7795.80 - 7802.56] P:1784.29 E:0.294455 |  Who have found a little bit of extra gas in the tank? Yeah, I think Columbia has come off the pace as well, so
[7804.16 - 7806.16] P:1920.29 E:0.307657 |  Could be a few more mistakes
[7806.96 - 7812.80] P:1907.68 E:0.324030 |  111 minutes have been played of the 120 still won one
[7814.88 - 7822.08] P:1950.96 E:0.301192 |  Daya with a high ball out towards Henderson on the far side back to Danny Rose puts his foot on it Henderson
[7823.20 - 7827.32] P:1922.09 E:0.335018 |  Maguire is there and Maguire will carry the ball forward towards the edge of the penalty area
[7827.32 - 7831.92] P:1893.79 E:0.283523 |  But his past is deflected away by Barry Ospin back to the red shirts of England
[7832.72 - 7840.76] P:1955.19 E:0.319347 |  Whistles from the Colombian fans inside the stadium here because it is England who are just beginning to move into the ascendancy again
[7841.00 - 7848.00] P:1867.82 E:0.316655 |  Deepen extra time Rose Rose will now latch onto a ball and shoot right across the face of goal and beyond the far post
[7849.12 - 7853.20] P:1586.31 E:0.326328 |  What a great move a great run by Danny Rose that says a lot of tail eggs out there
[7853.32 - 7855.76] P:1741.07 E:0.311324 |  He's a suburbs come on you should have a lot of energy
[7856.24 - 7860.02] P:1749.34 E:0.284591 |  Drills that across as a slight deflection. I thought they always give a goal kick
[7860.90 - 7864.34] P:1815.19 E:0.313562 |  Marcus Rashford is being spoken to at length by Garret Southgate here
[7864.34 - 7871.26] P:1771.63 E:0.275289 |  Garret Southgate was standing in front of him with his hands on the top of his shoulders talking directly into his face
[7872.38 - 7874.38] P:1767.05 E:0.249617 |  and now
[7874.66 - 7876.66] P:1768.90 E:0.253025 |  Rashford comes up
[7876.90 - 7882.06] P:1746.36 E:0.311497 |  And he will be coming on to replace Kyle Walker who was struggling with cramp
[7882.98 - 7885.94] P:1831.34 E:0.316259 |  Well, yeah struggling badly dial go to a
[7886.98 - 7888.98] P:1842.64 E:0.287872 |  right side of the three
[7890.74 - 7894.50] P:1700.30 E:0.317419 |  Eric Dyer has dropped back in there that was always going to be an option for England
[7895.18 - 7901.26] P:1754.06 E:0.292072 |  Marcus Rashford strength sprints onto the field. That's what's going in midfield with Anderson and Lindon Rashford
[7901.70 - 7903.70] P:1731.22 E:0.289690 |  to the left hand side
[7904.86 - 7906.86] P:1660.05 E:0.322833 |  Talks to Jordan Henderson still
[7907.90 - 7913.38] P:1777.43 E:0.288246 |  So Rashford who we saw it right wing back didn't we against Belgium in the
[7914.78 - 7916.78] P:1871.47 E:0.259651 |  In the last group match
[7917.78 - 7919.78] P:1830.88 E:0.280452 |  Rashford
[7919.82 - 7923.74] P:1722.49 E:0.246266 |  In another unfamiliar position and that's it
[7924.42 - 7926.42] P:1774.80 E:0.315828 |  That is the end of the
[7926.46 - 7933.00] P:1826.12 E:0.292102 |  Substitutions or actually not in Columbia have won more if they want to use it Columbia won England won
[7934.50 - 7941.46] P:1961.70 E:0.319793 |  And we have less than seven minutes to go before penalties penalties at a World Cup involving England
[7941.74 - 7946.94] P:1863.32 E:0.308248 |  Here's Vardy though Vardy on to the ball down the right crosses to the near post a touch by Lindon
[7946.94 - 7953.18] P:1762.69 E:0.304428 |  But a blocking save by the sliding Barrios to put it wider than the approach more like Jamie Vard
[7953.18 - 7956.22] P:1628.98 E:0.312795 |  He is he runs down the channel put spins out his right hand side
[7956.70 - 7960.86] P:1733.85 E:0.308706 |  Lot of tail legs and that defense great first touch and a lovely early ball in
[7961.50 - 7967.94] P:1804.25 E:0.312964 |  Oh and in God's kind of going to touch on it, but I've got a corner which there always carry a threat carry a threat from a corner England
[7968.22 - 7974.78] P:1925.71 E:0.307345 |  We know that no team at this World Cup has scored more goals from set pieces than Garo Southgate's England team
[7975.46 - 7977.22] P:1937.57 E:0.305020 |  Columbia did it to them
[7977.22 - 7981.42] P:1932.69 E:0.353329 |  Can England do it to Columbia here? It is on the chances headed over the top?
[7981.42 - 7985.82] P:1895.26 E:0.279492 |  I think it was Eric Dyer who was in there clear header
[7986.78 - 7991.26] P:1790.31 E:0.288782 |  Seven yards out and he had it over the top right in front of Terry butcher
[7992.26 - 7996.90] P:1829.56 E:0.317456 |  Yeah, he didn't get up early enough Eric Dyer good ball in over the top of the first man
[7996.90 - 7999.58] P:1716.47 E:0.311681 |  Just over the top of the first man didn't get up above the ball
[7999.74 - 8005.86] P:1828.66 E:0.318120 |  So they therefore he hits the ball underneath and over the crossbar. What's a chance that was what a chance any any header on target
[8005.86 - 8009.70] P:1859.63 E:0.311824 |  And that's two one and just when it seemed Chris Waddle that England
[8009.94 - 8016.38] P:1742.82 E:0.309092 |  Were right up against it. They've rallied in this second period of extra time and have created enough chances to have won it
[8016.42 - 8021.82] P:1662.34 E:0.284549 |  Yeah, they have they've a second period of extra time. They're on top there goodness come right off the pace
[8022.54 - 8026.62] P:1755.59 E:0.283515 |  The crowd's gone quiet as well, which is good. They're going to change their right back
[8026.62 - 8033.54] P:1814.63 E:0.284178 |  That's the final change that Columbia are making there their permitted fourth substitution in extra time Arias
[8033.90 - 8036.26] P:1815.97 E:0.297318 |  is going to be replaced by
[8036.86 - 8038.86] P:1846.23 E:0.251731 |  the AC Milan
[8038.86 - 8040.86] P:1814.18 E:0.286213 |  Defender Christian Zapata
[8041.58 - 8048.78] P:1788.23 E:0.297567 |  Very played for AC Milan this season. I think Arias might be another one who is just struggling a little
[8050.30 - 8053.62] P:1790.46 E:0.315354 |  After these almost 120 minutes of intense effort
[8055.10 - 8057.74] P:1840.79 E:0.290467 |  So that is it for the substitutions
[8059.90 - 8065.30] P:1832.17 E:0.289272 |  We have less than five minutes to play and then it'll be penalties
[8066.06 - 8068.06] P:1937.59 E:0.288838 |  England
[8068.06 - 8070.94] P:1900.52 E:0.316425 |  Have been involved in three penalty shootouts at World Cups
[8071.50 - 8074.78] P:1792.36 E:0.292314 |  Lost them all if you know your football you can probably reel them off
[8075.10 - 8082.06] P:1921.50 E:0.296811 |  Here's Kane in the center circle Kane looks to his left Harry Kane to Lin guard Lin guard with a flick
[8082.06 - 8084.70] P:1809.97 E:0.296277 |  Kane takes it on for he might have been blocked there
[8084.70 - 8089.50] P:1882.29 E:0.313311 |  But no free kick and Columbia coming forward all of these Colombian supporters
[8090.46 - 8097.22] P:1813.34 E:0.274157 |  Raise their sound level as Columbia passed the halfway line now on the left-hand side
[8097.62 - 8102.64] P:1769.83 E:0.292390 |  Mokica back it goes though into central defense to Davinson Sanchez and Barry Ross
[8103.26 - 8105.42] P:1797.44 E:0.338568 |  Barry Ross flicks the pass to the right-hand side
[8107.38 - 8112.24] P:1756.36 E:0.343022 |  Zapata the newly arrived Zapata gives it to quadrado quadrados ball in towards Falco
[8112.26 - 8116.14] P:1797.52 E:0.304063 |  He's headed across his own penalty area by Daya
[8116.58 - 8122.70] P:1895.81 E:0.333160 |  It's given us a goal kick and that was a clear deflection off the head of Daya
[8123.58 - 8129.46] P:1736.35 E:0.299870 |  And it's given us a goal kick Falco is nowhere near that by the way unless he thinks nobody touched it
[8130.62 - 8135.10] P:1795.97 E:0.299303 |  Well, that's what they must think. Yeah, he thinks nobody's touched it. He's given a goal kick
[8135.94 - 8137.58] P:1852.29 E:0.283515 |  That's an escape
[8137.58 - 8139.58] P:1882.68 E:0.276829 |  England don't want to face another
[8139.86 - 8145.06] P:1817.76 E:0.278739 |  Colombian corner one won the score came clicks ahead or on looking for Vardy but
[8145.46 - 8150.42] P:1715.46 E:0.288747 |  cleared away by Davinson Sanchez who's had an excellent game actually Davinson Sanchez and then
[8151.74 - 8157.06] P:1792.57 E:0.314280 |  Down goes this time Muriel only a slight touch from trivia no free-kick given
[8158.30 - 8160.70] P:1853.70 E:0.310099 |  I think the referee might finally have got wise to it
[8161.54 - 8164.58] P:2015.28 E:0.341039 |  So he took them up 170 minutes not barred up
[8165.78 - 8167.78] P:2034.09 E:0.346480 |  We're into the final two minutes
[8168.02 - 8173.34] P:1900.01 E:0.334330 |  Oh Danny Rose is taken out by quadrado. That's an awful challenge. It was late
[8173.34 - 8176.82] P:1828.96 E:0.296314 |  I think Rose has just been able to reveal it
[8177.06 - 8181.30] P:1801.89 E:0.262930 |  But if if he'd made contact there on Danny Rose that could have been nasty
[8181.94 - 8186.86] P:1631.04 E:0.299563 |  Yellow card for quadrado silly challenge because England are very dangerous. It's that pieces improved all night
[8187.66 - 8190.86] P:1833.46 E:0.302819 |  That's the sixth Colombian player to be booked
[8195.38 - 8197.38] P:1911.81 E:0.308452 |  Free kick then for England
[8198.78 - 8200.54] P:1921.25 E:0.277656 |  Danny Rose
[8200.54 - 8208.08] P:1951.74 E:0.298663 |  Took no hurt from that challenge and it will be Danny Rose to swing in this free kick for England late in extra time
[8208.42 - 8213.00] P:1911.82 E:0.332012 |  Rose's delivery. Oh, Spina comes for it and gets a fingertip to it to
[8214.10 - 8215.74] P:1921.12 E:0.328570 |  deflect it away
[8215.74 - 8217.74] P:1983.25 E:0.280239 |  Out for a throw in or Spina
[8218.18 - 8225.10] P:1691.86 E:0.288049 |  No, you're not believe this or Spina has stayed down again. Which was a game. He kept falling down Poland was it?
[8225.74 - 8228.58] P:1721.37 E:0.302579 |  Think it was or was it was Poland? I think yes
[8229.70 - 8231.70] P:1972.10 E:0.305969 |  He's on his feet again
[8232.30 - 8235.82] P:1944.97 E:0.327886 |  Throw in we're now in the 119th minute
[8237.22 - 8238.50] P:2008.23 E:0.320182 |  Penalties
[8238.50 - 8239.50] P:1985.63 E:0.279089 |  Approaching
[8239.50 - 8244.02] P:1898.62 E:0.309368 |  Thrain for England tripier into the box clicked on by McGuire whacked away
[8245.22 - 8247.22] P:1957.30 E:0.235405 |  for Columbia
[8247.22 - 8249.22] P:1875.12 E:0.253109 |  by Mina
[8249.34 - 8251.34] P:1891.72 E:0.285792 |  England have left the big man up
[8252.18 - 8255.18] P:1967.98 E:0.296510 |  So Rashford playing the ball to trippier
[8255.54 - 8261.22] P:1878.91 E:0.301040 |  Trippier now to John Stones on the halfway line England. We've got to be careful here. Stones is carefully
[8262.42 - 8266.48] P:2093.09 E:0.354835 |  Last five minutes to me face is used the ball very very well again had a shaky
[8267.14 - 8271.42] P:1886.03 E:0.304278 |  Shaggy period long ball from Tickford. That's headed away by quadrado
[8271.42 - 8277.50] P:1733.73 E:0.287795 |  was allowed to bounce by Henderson in the center circle and then wins the bouncing ball against Radamel Falcao
[8277.74 - 8280.18] P:1840.34 E:0.278149 |  We are now in the 120th minute
[8280.78 - 8282.78] P:1972.68 E:0.289499 |  It looks like it's going to be penalties
[8291.98 - 8296.78] P:2011.02 E:0.318546 |  Stones and Henderson and now Rashford Rashford on his right foot
[8296.78 - 8300.34] P:1978.58 E:0.314030 |  He's up against Barrios. So he plays it out here to the right-hand side to Trippier
[8300.58 - 8304.22] P:1906.96 E:0.325962 |  Trippier's ball forward has been charged down by Muriel and
[8304.70 - 8309.38] P:1827.80 E:0.280612 |  Mohica it is actually and the ball bounces off him out of play for
[8309.38 - 8311.54] P:1710.36 E:0.332683 |  When I rush on this on this it's going to take your time
[8311.54 - 8314.86] P:1848.54 E:0.296969 |  I think they've accepted Grumbert it's going to go it will shoot out
[8318.18 - 8320.18] P:1922.97 E:0.309496 |  Throw in
[8320.18 - 8322.18] P:1906.54 E:0.320874 |  Mohica to take it
[8324.38 - 8326.38] P:1790.23 E:0.332098 |  Just watching a replay
[8326.38 - 8329.38] P:1757.96 E:0.290369 |  Harry McGuire placed a hand on Osbina
[8330.02 - 8332.86] P:1815.02 E:0.302788 |  And Osbina collapsed to the ground
[8333.50 - 8338.26] P:1795.47 E:0.307746 |  Balls out of play for a throw. That's it one minute of added time. We have 60 seconds
[8338.78 - 8342.82] P:1710.53 E:0.313646 |  Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls late in the evening in Moscow
[8343.18 - 8347.02] P:1703.56 E:0.295718 |  We are one minute away from a penalty shootout
[8347.66 - 8352.66] P:1698.94 E:0.295557 |  Between England and Columbia for a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup
[8352.66 - 8356.42] P:1792.06 E:0.305015 |  I think my heart rate's just increased insane those worlds
[8357.18 - 8362.14] P:1807.24 E:0.315848 |  Wacked across field by Mohica might be a chance to win it yet final ball into the box by
[8362.66 - 8367.26] P:1807.69 E:0.303067 |  Quadradole to the edge of the area stones wins ahead of comes out to Mohica Mohica
[8367.58 - 8373.90] P:1859.27 E:0.276699 |  Up against Trippier Trippier tries to recover Mohica's gone past him and then fell over and the balls behind
[8374.42 - 8375.42] P:1933.54 E:0.237645 |  Goal kick
[8375.42 - 8381.58] P:1825.07 E:0.298072 |  That's gonna be it. It's got to be it now, isn't it? 20 seconds here 20 seconds away. He's not there. He can't kick the long way
[8383.98 - 8385.98] P:2032.79 E:0.301720 |  Pickled with a goal kick
[8387.06 - 8389.06] P:2079.89 E:0.364600 |  I
[8391.82 - 8393.82] P:1989.70 E:0.324495 |  Smashing it down the middle
[8394.46 - 8399.46] P:1903.56 E:0.329654 |  Onto the head of Kane who tries to head it on that is beaten by Sanchez and that's it
[8400.06 - 8402.06] P:1963.97 E:0.284742 |  That's it
[8402.06 - 8407.62] P:1865.69 E:0.321821 |  England's first match in the knockout stage at this World Cup ends in a 1-1 draw
[8407.98 - 8411.10] P:1824.27 E:0.301318 |  Columbia won England won after extra time
[8411.54 - 8417.12] P:1830.92 E:0.284176 |  And you know what that means it's penalties for England at a World Cup
[8421.46 - 8423.46] P:1872.70 E:0.278696 |  You're right
[8425.66 - 8430.66] P:1803.41 E:0.311082 |  Yeah, I could understand your nerves I was checking John more you are you gonna have to loosen your cagoo
[8433.38 - 8435.38] P:1829.61 E:0.303618 |  Can't have my game can it I
[8437.90 - 8440.58] P:1901.77 E:0.282717 |  Think we should just run through
[8441.30 - 8443.30] P:1812.20 E:0.317169 |  Exactly how bad England's record is
[8443.82 - 8445.82] P:1930.50 E:0.240337 |  for those who don't know
[8446.02 - 8451.66] P:1833.95 E:0.286744 |  England have been involved in seven penalty shootouts at either a World Cup or a European Championship
[8452.06 - 8457.46] P:1836.18 E:0.266411 |  Tournament finals. They've lost six of the seven at World Cups. They've been involved in three
[8457.86 - 8459.86] P:1931.59 E:0.239558 |  They've lost all three Germany
[8460.70 - 8466.46] P:1778.85 E:0.256661 |  1990 to Argentina in 98 to Portugal in 2006, but
[8467.46 - 8470.82] P:1840.62 E:0.288402 |  Penalties are something that the Garos Southgate identified
[8471.50 - 8476.58] P:1891.04 E:0.267252 |  The FA have identified it. They've used all sorts of methods as much as you can
[8477.54 - 8486.06] P:1791.02 E:0.279723 |  They have tried to encourage England to slow down and to to be more deliberate not to hurry their penalties
[8486.06 - 8492.10] P:1771.69 E:0.256454 |  They found that England on average took their penalties much more quickly than other teams take their penalties
[8492.38 - 8497.86] P:1807.76 E:0.270120 |  They've been involved in other little games as well putting competitions in a penalty style a
[8498.26 - 8502.46] P:1823.76 E:0.270868 |  Lot of work has gone into this but at the end Chris it comes down to
[8503.10 - 8508.10] P:1747.98 E:0.292848 |  12 yards of all a man and a goalkeeper that it's it more when they were tired and mentally tired
[8509.86 - 8512.18] P:1809.98 E:0.331560 |  Probably not and when they walk up there now
[8512.58 - 8516.90] P:1807.97 E:0.331368 |  You don't do that in training morning training, but there's no crowd and it's not all yellow behind the goal
[8517.22 - 8521.62] P:1824.36 E:0.308283 |  Well both of the matches that we've covered in the last 16 Chris have gone to penalties
[8522.10 - 8526.06] P:1669.06 E:0.330650 |  It was great fun wasn't it the other day you and I watching Spain and Russia what a luck that was
[8526.62 - 8528.62] P:1809.14 E:0.277443 |  This feels rather different
[8529.86 - 8531.96] P:1761.01 E:0.312781 |  Columbia are going to take their penalties first
[8534.06 - 8539.64] P:1790.09 E:0.290187 |  This for a place in the quarterfinal against Sweden on Saturday afternoon Jordan Pickford
[8540.50 - 8542.50] P:1756.37 E:0.314325 |  this mobile
[8542.86 - 8549.06] P:1751.52 E:0.294438 |  Everton goalkeeper with an excellent record of saving penalties at under 21 level for England as well
[8549.46 - 8553.98] P:1766.95 E:0.275908 |  He's excelled himself and it's Radamel Falcao who's going to take the first one
[8553.98 - 8557.42] P:1859.48 E:0.300565 |  So Columbia will take the penalties first in the end to our left
[8558.14 - 8561.78] P:1760.29 E:0.306722 |  Thousands of day in Colombians behind that goal Jordan take foot on his line
[8562.86 - 8569.70] P:1798.02 E:0.330080 |  Radamel Falcao the Colombian captain right-footed drives it down the middle high past pick for who died to his left
[8570.06 - 8572.06] P:1836.89 E:0.334094 |  Fine penalty one nail Columbia
[8573.06 - 8575.06] P:1900.36 E:0.319606 |  Gotta say
[8575.06 - 8577.06] P:1920.54 E:0.296527 |  20 minutes or plus a football
[8577.62 - 8582.82] P:1897.42 E:0.322153 |  Banges straight down the middle laces straight down the middle pick that goes to his right. Yep
[8583.42 - 8588.46] P:1992.30 E:0.328242 |  Very good. So David Ospina of Arsenal takes his place in the goal
