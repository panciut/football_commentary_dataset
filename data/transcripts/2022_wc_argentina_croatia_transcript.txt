 ... and a magician, Modric and Messi, two majestic players, but only one will reach Sunday's World Cup final. We're under way, you're listening to BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, and we're also live on the BBC World Service across Africa. As Croatia are playing from right to left as we look, I think it's fair to say they're attacking the Buenos Aires end here in the La Salle stadium. Although to be fair, with the exception of the red and white of Croatia in the bottom tier away towards our right-hand side, there are Argentinian fans everywhere. Here is Sosa, back to Gavadio, and there's also a new ball for the semi-finals and the final. They use Alrilia, which is the journey up until now, and now they've changed it. The official ball is called the Dream, Al Hill. It's a golden ball that will be used tonight, tomorrow and on Sunday, as Argentina pick up the ball and then the ball goes out of play and it will be a throw on that far side. Just looking at that Argentinian midfield, Ian, is that the instrument callus to that sort of taking that left-hand side roll, De Paul on the right and Parides and Fernandez in the middle. Here is De Paul, quickly out for his feet by Romero to Ottenendee to come forward. Very settled side throughout this tournament. Croatia, nine have started all six matches in this tournament in a world cup where they are yet to score the opening goal. Here is De Paul on the near side of the right, looking to try and get it forward towards Molina, the right back in the foot chase with Sosa. It gets on the end of it as well as the right back. There's your answer, Rob. You asked that question to Pablo Zabaleta. He's getting forward, isn't he? He doesn't get much from a question asked. It just goes. It does well. It's a good ball for him to reach. There wasn't really the presence in the middle there that was going to make it a real threat, but there was indecision at the back for balls over the top from Croatia. Trofjord Croatia on the left. It's a long one up towards Kramaric, over his head. De Paul then lays the ball back and now it is with Romero inside the centre-circle of the Argentinian half. These early stages here on BBC Radio 5 Live, and it's cut out there in the midfield by Prosevic to Moderic. Teresic tries to spin away, but the challenge will come in now from Molina and it goes out of play. Our referee, by the way, is Daniel Osato from Italy. We hope that we don't have to call in his Italian colleague, Similiano Errati, who's on VAR Tuesdays. Here there is Enzo Fernandez in the midfield. Ottenbendi plays it forward and now with Teresic. Romero will run forward. A little bit of space on the halfway line, goes back inside. De Paul. Molina is quite high on this, near side the right. Argentina playing from left to right. De Paul looking to try and get Talia Fico forward and the one bounce and it's caught by the keeper. There's huge concentration on the Croatian players every time they get the ball, to stop that ball into Messi. You know he wants to try and drop deep, but the number of players that are around him is stopping that. Driving forward there from the midfield was Prosevic looking for Kramaric and Argentina with Romero's quick thinking is trying to play it off the legs of Kramaric. We'll get an Argentinian throw, but already Rob, in these opening three and a half minutes we've seen both fullbacks for Argentina getting forward. Yeah they've got space to get forward, it's really interesting that Alan touched on it there. McAllister is also taking up a really good position and it's Prosevic in the midfield, the sitting midfielder for Croatia who's got his work cut out. Because he's got people coming up on either side so he's just going to have to spend the whole night turning his head, picking his moment, who to pick up. Alvarez loses out, he ran into Pashalic, it's lifted forward then by Moderic. De Sosa with his long fair hair on this near side, the left. Perishic plays it back and now with Kovacic back out towards the top and player Perishic and floats over across and it's well claimed by Emi Martinez. Good confident take wasn't it? That's what you need as he's sent a half when that ball comes in, come and help, come and take the pressure off, did it really well. Now with Fernandez drifting out towards the left hand side, plays it back to McAllister, goes away from him but there in the midfield is Paredes. And now with Messi, you can hear the excitement around the stadium when Messi got a little touch of the ball there as De Paul still quite deep in the midfield, out now towards Fernandez who will turn. Talia Fico, the Argentinian supporters inside the stadium raised the volume, we're used to that. We had it on so many occasions in that gripping quarter-final tie against the Netherlands on Friday night. Argentina though in possession, five minutes played here on BBC Radio 5 Live and it is still goalers. Romero to De Paul, triangular passing patterns from the Argentina players and Paredes just trotting forward and then he hits a pasty ball but that was, he's pulled it away from Molina out for a goal kick. It's interesting where De Paul's playing in the midfield, he's playing very narrow and he's the outside one of the four. Because he's playing narrow, Perisic can't go out, he can't go and get attracted to Molina, he's got to stay narrow, that leaves Molina the space in the wing. So much experience in the commentary box tonight, two players who've played for England at a World Cup, Rob Green for South Africa in 2010 and indeed, Alan, sliding challenge, the referees that have played advantage I think but they're not happy about that, the bench down below but play does continue. But you've captained England against Argentina in 98. I did, you don't have to remind us of the result at the end as well, Denner. I wasn't going to do that. Thank you. Six minutes played, only now when players stopped but the Croatian bench down below were not happy and the fourth official at the moment is just having to have a word whilst quietly, like Godalic, the coach is in the ear of the assistant referee. The credit of Daniel Osato, the Italian referee, he did try and let the game flow. Yeah, he did. Sorry Rob, and I think what's also been a theme certainly in the knockout stages is that there's so many boxes when they went in the substitutes, the coaches, the manager are all up there trying to attack the referee and put as much pressure on as possible and that's exactly what the Croatians were doing then. They certainly saw that against the Netherlands on Friday here. Back to Emi Martinez, all in green. Goes over the head of Alvarez and out of play for A-throw. Seven minutes played whilst the World Cup is winding down. We don't stop when it comes to live football on five live Thursday night. Thursday night the Scottish Premiership ranges hips from eight o'clock and next Tuesday, League of Action fourth round on five live and BBC sounds. Tuesday, MK Donz, Leicester City, Wednesday Manchester United Burnley, Thursday Manchester City Liverpool and the Premier League returns on Boxing Day. BBC Radio five live is your place for the live football, whether it's at the World Cup or domestically. Vardio, who I'm sure will be seeing in the Premier League very, very soon at the heart of that Croatian defence. Still, little, little and now Brozovic takes over. Here is Kovacic in a walking pace midway through his own half. Kramaric gives it back to him. Argentina drop off. Brozovic now passes the ball across to Werter Lovren. Now playing his football in Russia at St Petersburg. Brozovic now reaches the right hand side. The ball is trying to get it up towards Pashelic. It will go to a Croatian throw on that right hand side. Is that what you were referring to earlier about just taking their time to get up the pitch? Yeah, you look at Modric and how wonderful player he is and he's needed all over the pitch. Just his ability on the ball. So he'll drop into the back line to get the ball to progress it forwards. And once they do, it just almost need him up there again. Watching them against Brazil and he kind of thinking they needed two Modradics in the team. There's not two in the world. As Alan was saying as well, there is certainly no shortage of experience. Kovacic is 90th appearance tonight. Brozovic is 83rd and Modric 161. Here is Kramaric midway through the Argentina half. So to provide the width, the left back on this near side. The return ball from Perichic goes away from him. Merotides up for Argentina, helped out by De Paul, plays it back. And then Molina the right back is closed down by Kramaric. And it will be a throw to Argentina deep inside their own half. We've been playing for nearly 10 minutes and it's still 0-0. Don't think you've ever had a bad game and you've been doing five line, have you? Pressure right now then, isn't it? I won't mention the school from San Etienne, but if it's a duffer this one. It's a throw to Croatia near side the left. Highlights of this by the way on BBC One at a quarter to midnight. And tomorrow, France, Morocco is live on BBC One, which means you can actually watch and listen through the option of World Cup Extra to the five live commentary through the iPlayer. Here is Perichic to take the throw on this near side the left for Croatia. It's still goalless. It's a long throw, headed out by Romero in front of his own goalkeeper, Emi Martinez. Messi loses out. Guardiola is there, high at the pitch for Croatia, the centre-back, then plays it back behind Lovren and it's going to run through to Liverpool which is the goalkeeper all in luminous orange. Croatia won't mind that, getting the ball into the box and it didn't work out, but they do do well. Stay brave, stay high, retain possession. When the ball comes out, what Argentina don't have is a large presence up front to hold the ball up so they can dominate when they are in good positions. Brozovic is dropped in between the two central defenders. The full backs are pushed up quite high for Croatia. Here is Guardiola. Actually sometimes plays as a left-back for his club Leipzig. So, who's playing left-back for his country, wins that 50-50, plays it back to the defender we've just been talking about and now Brozovic takes over once again, just sitting there in front of the back four. Plays it short and forwards to Kovacic. Perichic back then for Guardiola. Argentina again have every one of those players in the white and sky blue shirts, striped shirts back behind the ball. Perichic, they're looking of course to reach back-to-back World Cup finals. What an achievement that would be for Croatia. Perichic, patient play by Zlatko Dalic's side. Kovacic gives it to Brozovic, tries to run away from Alvarez. Kovacic helps it, gets it back from Krambovic. Krambovic, they've worked it neatly and now out towards the left-hand side. And so, Sosa plays it down the line, Perichic sliding in. It was patient play but they were progressing. Yeah, what you're seeing is that both teams are really good, without the ball they're really well organised and having to work and move around for each other and Argentina having to do that because of the midfield trio that we've mentioned and how good they are on the ball. 12 minutes played, still 0-0 to a backdrop of Argentinian voices serenading everybody inside the La Salle stadium. So, Sosa on this near side of the left, well cross right footed, it was low, strikes the back of the legs of Perichic and trying to hope that it would roll out for a corner kick but it didn't have the power. But Croatia have retained the ball. Vardiole on this near side of the left. Now to Brozovic, Modric in Basel in March 2006. Croatia-Argentina, Messi scored his first goal as an 18-year-old. Modric made his debut at the age of 20 and here they are up against each other. Two of the world's greatest players fighting it out for a place in Sunday's World Cup final. Free kick to Argentina that's already been taken. De Paul plays it back, stroked forward by Otimendi and now with Romero right to the centre circle and it's Croatia's turn to drop off as De Paul will play it towards Paredes, out now towards Fernandez on that far side of the left. Talia Fico is hooking that touch line, Croatia there with the interception and they now try and play it forward and looking to break was Uranovic the right back for Croatia, the Celtic player and they might be able to exploit that gap that he's left now as Lovren has to fill in. This is Fernandez, there's a challenge just outside the area by Vardiole and Messi. The Italian referee says no free kick. Messi tries to run in behind, it's a lovely clever little ball with the outside of the foot and he thinks he was actually tripped, conceived by his reaction in the way he looked at the referee. Rob, I just don't think he was going to get that, he realised the pass was a bit too strong and just maybe, maybe realised and looked for the contact and went down but that's the first real opening Argentina have had that you say well, Croatia gambled, one man went out of position, they're in, they're in on the gap. Here is Lovren, spraying the ball forward, looking to try and get on the end of it was at Juranovic's the right back, he'd made a darting run forward and it was headed out of play for a throw and Croatia get a throw quite high at the pitch 0-0. That was a very, very good ball, very long ball from Lovren, that must have travelled all of 50 or 60 yards with a run of Juranovic. He's one of the players who started every game so far, he's the one who's now going to take the throw over on that right hand side, we've been playing for a quarter of an hour here on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds and it is still Argentina 0, Croatia 0, in comes the throw, flipped on by Perichich headed out by Ottoman, bouncing ball downward headed by Sosa, bounces away from Kovacic it'll be picked up by Brozovic just over the half way line and Kovacic strokes it back to Gavadio, with his green boots, the protective face mask and now back with the Leipzig defender, dropping deep, Kramaric, Sosa on this near side the left doesn't opt to play the ball down the line to Perichich, instead goes back to Brozovic who curls it across to Lovren and again the full backs are pushed on here for Croatia here's one of them, Juranovic with a little flick ball forward towards Moderic and Moderic now will run forward coming in off that right touch line using his strength holding on to the ball, Moderic has done well, Juranovic with a cross and Croatia get a corner That's really good play from Croatia particularly Moderic, we said it in pre-programme but sometimes he's the furthest forward, he was on that occasion, did really well, battled really well to get the ball into Juranovic into that right back position and they get the corner, they're looking dangerous They are and they've certainly got plenty of aerial threat here for the corner kick because Lovren is up from the back, Kvardioli is there, Perichich and now after all that they roll it short back towards Moderic on the right hand side it's still taken, Juranovic then on the overlap delivers the ball towards the far post, Lovren was there and there's two Argentinian players have gone down with a clash of heads and there's going to be a stoppage in play It was the 10-bit bowling ball and they with the pins just bundled them over in the box Clash of heads all over it, you can imagine he enjoyed that Lovren I know somebody else would have enjoyed it You're hinting at that though Well they're back on their feet and they don't seem to be too bad, it was Molina the right back and Romero the other defender, the central defender of Tottenham Hotspur I think they'll only go down as a spare rather than a strike Very good, but if you look at the creation, we're not surprised by how good they are on the ball But it is a bit surprising how comfortable they've been in the game and how much possession they've been allowed in the Argentinian half without being overly threatening but they still just kept the ball and kept passing it and kept probing Can you imagine Alan what they'd be like if they still had Manzukic a genuine threat That's not only them in this tournament in terms of lacking a top class forward Here is Kramaric, former Leicester player Watch him stick one in the top corner in the next 10 minutes Stepping up forward there was Paredes but he's lost the ball of Argentina and Croatia have got it back Now up towards Sosa on this left hand side Sosa's cross, the delivery was found once it was high Lacking direction and drifting out of play for a goal kick and we're still at 0-0 That's been a common theme for Croatia in this tournament Dominating possession in that midfield, having so much of the ball and when they get into those forward positions and just lack that little bit of quality or that threat in the box You get the feeling that Argentina have turned around and gone Yeah, we'll go narrow with that four in midfield to let Sosa the left bag have it because we know he's not got that quality Just moments ago when there was that aerial clash between Molina and Romero the two players colliding with each other, when that ball went out for a goal kick Romero actually just went down onto his haunches as if he was just struggling a fraction So we'll have to keep an eye on whether there might just be a touch of concussion He's just rubbing his head now as well as the Tottenham player Christian Romero As Argentina now have it over on that far side Talia Fico to McAllister, able to get into the Croatian half Still goalless though, 18 minutes play but Croatia have got it back with Moderic And now looking to make the run forward was Kramaric through the other midfield He goes to ground, the Italian referee will give a free kick But Kappacic was the player foul So it's a Croatian free kick outside the centre circle It was a free kick but McAllister was on the ball looking for options And because of the sheer number of Croatian players that were around him he had nowhere to go Hence Croatia breaking and getting that free kick Moderic takes it, they're at a walking pace Messi stretching his hamstring Oh yes he is Just feeling the hamstring from the back of his left leg there Messi in fact is still giving it a little massage as well So they've got two potential concerns for Lino Scoloni to keep an eye on Kramaric that was the first heavy touch He's given it a way back to Argentina Bearing in mind that Papogomas is not available with an ankle injury And they're missing the suspended Montiel, the reserve right back And the Cunha who would have actually started as a left back Instead of Talia Fico 20 minutes playing, nil-nil On the half way line, ball goes back now towards Romero Molina is an option on this near side the right Paul tried to make the run into a bit of space vacated by Sosa But that was Brozovic coming forward Lifts it in the air, brings it under control Karisic then on the left hand side back towards Sosa Seeing a lot of the ball on the left back on this near side As Moderic being tracked by the hard working Alvarez Of Manchester City, but a standing ovation As that one is out of play for his performance off the ball I think by the Argentine fans against the Netherlands in prior to his quarterfinal We haven't had a shot on target yet, it's very very tight, nil-nil I'm just looking at Messi there when Rob said he's stretching his hamstring Often sometimes you can look at a player and think Well he's not moving or he's stretching, but with Messi He does walk around and he's just trying to ghost into the game, doesn't he? And all of a sudden he's got that little spring in his step Here is Molina Seems to be okay for the time being Molina wants to take the throw quickly on this near side the right But the referee says she's just creeping a little bit too far downfield And he wants him back and he's still not happy Five live and BBC sounds, the first of the World Cup semi-finals Tomorrow night, here in Qatar from six o'clock with Mark Chapman At the Albaid Stadium, France against Morocco The ball is touched towards Messi and off that left foot He pings the ball out into space and Otta Mendi can run forward And now it is with Fernandez Almost showed a glimpse of the ball to where Tamaric, but they've managed to keep it Here is Argentina now with Romero just outside the centre circle Messi is going to come short towards the ball Molina stayed forward the right back, he touched it to Messi In field, the return ball back towards Messi Running forward, trying to get it into the path of Fernandez But Croatia's defence just squeezed in tight And now the break from Kovacic, he's looking for a foul The referee says no foul Well he's honestly outdid him there because if he went down he would have got the foul He bounced off him, two, three players, he could have gone down Messi running away from three Croatian players With the ball just stuck to his foot Now with Fernandez Messi now takes over midway through the Croatia half The Callister goes down, cleared away by Guardiola Only as far as Messi bounces away from him And out for a goal kick Just signs that there's gaps just starting to appear Just for the last two or three minutes, for the first time in the game we've seen Messi Picking the ball up and then running on those little quick feet of his And trying to find that little one-two off Alvarez And he did that Nothing come of it this time though, but just the signs that it may be opening up a little bit It's almost like he's watched it for 20 minutes and gone right I've had enough of this, I'm getting involved Rob Green and Alan Shearer with us here on DINICY Radio 5 Live With midway through the first half, it's Argentina Nil, Croatia Nil Croatia in their predominantly navy blue shirts Have a throw on the far side of the right Moderic makes himself available Messi and Moderic have played 26 times in their careers 22 of course were El Clasico But it's Moderic who has always had the upper hand He's won 12, drawn 5, he's tasted the fees on 9 occasions But here they are, for what probably will be their last ever appearance For the loser that is, at a world cup Here is Moderic Go on Third place, fourth place Oh yeah, didn't they play in that one? That's a meaningless game is it not? I thought you were doing a version of Ted Rogers 3-2 As far as I'm concerned, it's a meaningless game Probably for a lot of the players it is But you're right, there is that game on Saturday Whether they play it, it is up for grabs I'll get the equivalent of what's his dusty mid That's where they'll put the third place medal I was trying to do 3 fingers and 4 fingers I was 3rd and 4th but it didn't work obviously No, no, I'm just used to the 2 De Paul on this near side In field Paredes, Fernandez Looking for the run of Talia Fico around the back Slides into it in that penalty area Menenties to hook over the cross as well And Sosa is opposite number for Croatia Clears it out of play for a throw Talia Fico did ever so well The good run and a very good ball but again They only had one person in the box And Alvarez, I looked at the where Messi was And 2 or 3 yards outside of the 18-yard box Paredes, forward ball McAllister to Fernandez who takes over Fernandez with a shot, forced the same Livakovic was down towards his left Paranid away to safety What I thought as a goalkeeper Rob, it has seen that quite late He did see it like scrambled across And it wasn't a comfortable save Just a skip off the service and what saved him really was A bounce far enough away from him that he could read it Another yard closer to him on that bounce And he could have been struggling He hit the post late on against the Netherlands That's probably the best, well the only effort really In this tight semi-final so far of Argentina Nile Croatia Nile The Livakovic moving away towards He's left, the 33-year-old goalkeeper did well Argentina though were back in possession De Paul outside the centre-circle of his own half Comes over the half-way line now towards Molina on this near side Molina goes back towards De Paul De Paul gives it away Need away by Gavadio They try and win it back through Alvarez Sosa goes in field, Lovren plays a short Diakul ball and then Brosevic lifts it out towards Joranovic but it goes over his head They do well to keep the ball in play But the Celtic defender does exactly that Down the line it goes, Telefico with interception Stepping out of defence, now with McAllister for Argentina De Paul forward of the centre-circle Messi, Diakul ball loses it But a court-coverage, Kovacic But Kovacic is done ever so well Great strength from Kovacic, forward ball to Kramaric Pashlic is going ahead of him And the referee as he was fouled gives a free kick to Croatia Super play from Kovacic, the way he actually Won the ball off Messi's shield and away But then he had the ability and the strength To drive another 20 or 30 yards forward And then play that ball into Kramaric And he gets the free kick And there's little moderate there, straight onto it I think he'll be taking this one It's just under 30 yards out from goal It's right of centre, it's 0-0 here on 5-5 All the BBC sounds at You can take us with you wherever you go Through the BBC sounds at And Croatia have a free kick Argentina trying to offer his look Trying to offer as much protection to Emi Martinez Have two in the wall With their white and sky blue striped shirts Outside the penalty area Big boys are up from the back Moderic and Sosa The two long-haired players are standing over the free kick It'll be Sosa with his left foot Or Moderic with his right Perisic is currently standing in an offside position Sosa leaves it for Moderic Moderic clips it in a rather flat ball Headed away by Paredes Messi controls it on the edge of his own area It's caught in possession, but it breaks back And now the break is on Molina releases the ball over the halfway line Molina's look to continue his run The ball though is spread high towards Alvarez And there was Moderic Where does he get his energy from? He takes the free kick He's the one back in his own penalty area He's gone out of play for a throw He needed to because it was a poor free kick I realised his hair up, backtracked Playback underway Micalistar to Paredes Paredes Now it's with Over on that far side Fernandez and Talia Fico Linking up on the left They play the ball forward But it goes away from Micalistar And out for a goal kick Incredible though isn't he Moderic? You've got to remind yourself 37 years isn't he? He was the one that put the poor free kick in It was really good defending High defending from Argentina They held the line But then for him to run 60 or 70 yards further back And actually win the ball back is incredible Best player in Russia as well In 2018 Getting the golden ball It's something that he and Messi have also got in common Because Messi is a runner up Previously was also voted Player of the tournament As we're approaching the half hour We had predicted we could be in For the long haul here tonight And it remains 0-0 Given Creuacius record Of going to extra time Lovren Hits it long Headed away by Otten-Mendi for Argentina Pashalic wins the ball Midway through the Argentina half There's a nice little touch by Moderic Brozovic will run forward The ball wouldn't necessarily go with it Had to try and drag it with his right foot Emi Martinez keeps it in play From going out behind For a corner but concedes a throw You had to get that right Brozovic was on top of him Any false move and As a goalkeeper sliding out with your feet It's not something he used to That's Rob Green and Alan Shearer with us here Inside the Lusseil stadium Brozovic running out on that right hand side Down towards the corner flag Has to lift it back towards Uranovich Gives the ball away Argentina clear Every Croatian player is in the Argentina half And Gavadiole the central defender Plays it forward to Kovacic Brozovic now knocks it back Lovren's on the halfway line on the right hand side And switches play to this near side to left Where Sosa controls it Grabberic is floating And on the left hand side plays it back The ball will put Sosa under pressure And Croatia are forced to go back Towards Livakovic Gavadiole A little bit of a press from Argentina Isn't fazed It's Moderic It's just got a nutmeg McAllister Now it's up towards Kramaric Midway through the half Pashalic goes central Kovacic joins the attack Threatening this by Croatia Paracic joins the penalty area Goes for the chip Just over the top for a goal kick He's appealing for a corner kick He wants one He's adamant that actually takes the deflection And he's screaming at the referee And the assistant to say He wanted that as a corner He might just be right as well But how that started With Moderic wasn't it Just clipping the ball through McAllister's legs on the halfway line He should have got a corner Did take a deflection They're very easy on the eye though Aren't they when they've progressed down the field like that It's really good to see And really won't fall forward towards Alvarez Alvarez he's onside Alvarez nicks it goalwards Lovren with a clearance Was that a penalty? Yes it was Liver Kovac Shownie Yellowcarb The balling Alvarez And Argentina been awarded a penalty What a run it was from Alvarez He finds it himself clear Free which is something that Just hasn't happened in the first 32 minutes in this game It's wide open for him He's got the goalkeeper to beat He dinks it over the goalkeeper With not enough pace or power on it But the goalkeeper wipes him out And the referee's right on the spot And in fact then points to the spot And for me it was the correct decision Yeah it has to give it As soon as Liver Kovac Who has to commit Does commit He's got to win the ball He doesn't He's running off the back of Lovren Who's dropped so deep Compared to the rest of the back four It just opens up for him Once he gets that Nick He knows Liver Kovac He's not won the ball Clear contact It's unfortunate for him There's not a lot he can do But it's a penalty You know as well as I know Who's got the ball in his hands On his 25th appearance in a World Cup Equalling the record held by Lota Mataeus Lionel Messi Who scored in eight The last nine appearances for Argentina He's had mixed fortunes From the spot in this World Cup He missed against Poland But he scored two Already against Saudi Arabia And the Netherlands And Argentina's all-time top goal scorer Could see him here Become the highest goal scorer At a World Cup as well He's currently level with ten With Batas Tuta Messi against Liver Kovac Liver Kovac who saved four penalties In the shoot-outs at this World Cup All in orange weight On his goal line Lionel Messi Eddie Martinez at the other end Cannot look He's down on one knee Whilst Messi scores And the roar inside the La Sale stadium Will tell you that Lionel Messi On his record he's playing 25th appearance in a World Cup As Lashkin in left-footed And Argentina lead by a goal to Niel A different technique to what we saw Against the Netherlands We've seen that laid-back approach To when he just took it to the goalkeeper's left-hand side This time it's head down Front of the foot And he pings it high into the roof of the net The goalkeeper's got no chance What a penalty Brilliant penalty Almost sheer a mess He mentioned me and Messi I'm happy, that's my nightmare Did he run away with the Jordania? He ran straight to the fans that for sure Great strike, the goalkeeper had no chance The interesting thing with that is He did go the same side as what we saw In the Netherlands, but he went a lot higher And from that as a goalkeeper As soon as you commit to the dive You can't get up, you can't get high You're running the risk of it going over the bar But you get it right, unstoppable Messi has scored now 23 Of 28 penalties for Argentina It's his 11th goal In his 25th appearance in a World Cup And Argentina are ahead And Croatia at this World Cup Are in familiar territory Because yet again, their opponents have scored first But if we've learnt one thing About Croatia, you just do not write them off Because they have resolved They have the character, they have the spirit But once again they're going to have to show all of those qualities When you look at them and you say What are they going to do different to get back into the game? Nothing, they'll do exactly the same as what they've been doing Just keep plugging away But wherever you look around, this was Sales Stadium There are Argentinian fans everywhere And they, whatever they've got in their hand That is sky blue or white They're waving up up their head Whether it be a scarf, a flag or indeed a balloon They're 1-0 up And Croatia With 9 minutes to go at a half time Here on BBC Radio 5 Live They've got to come from behind Drozavic to Sosa Trying to get it down the line Looking to Perichic, out he goes for a throw It's very unlike them to leave themselves so open at the back And then Alvarez to 1-v, 1-v Liverpool bit There's been none of that in the first half Up until there, no space whatsoever for any forward It just looked like that Lovren panicked Saw the ball over the top, saw the run of the man And he dropped, he dropped He lost so deep Did say as well in the build-up to that That Livikowicz had got the yellow card Messi tries to take it, but he won't get the pace away from Sosa But also in the fallout The Chelsea midfield Kovacic has also shown a yellow card So the two of them have been booked for Croatia Of course the yellow cards were wiped The only reason you could miss Sunday's final For whoever progresses, or indeed the third place playoff Is if you are sent off in this game The first semi-final Second one tomorrow will have for you as well On BBC Radio 5 Live The build-up from 6 o'clock As Kramaric Looking to try and get the ball out towards this near side It's knotted back by Perichic It's played out towards Sosa on the left Sosa now with a right-footed cross Headed away By Paredes Comes back in though towards Kovacic To Brozovic, tackled by Paredes One back though by Moderic Lovren joins the attack as it goes to Yuranovic Looking to silence the Argentinian fans Charged down the cross Corner kick to Croatia as they trail by a golden hill It's a good possession again for Croatia I'm just thinking that the two wide options are the full backs They're just not shy enough They're crossing from too deep Which allows Argentina the ability to deal with it Corner kick to Croatia Seven minutes to go and a half time Arms being touched in the air From the Argentinian supporters They're not necessarily mimicking Alan Shearer's gold celebration That only happens at St James's Park Corner taken short on the right Cross charged down Premier League is back on boxing day We'll have all the domestic coverage for you On five live and BBC sounds As Alvarez is breaking Molina is going ahead of him Alvarez is still going into the penalty area And Alvarez has increased Argentina's lead With a surging strong run He bounced back to him And right footed He poked it in And Argentina now have a cushion They lead Croatia by two goals to Niel And what a run that was for the Manchester City player Ray Ran from the half-way line Messi managed to get the ball to him There were two or three defenders ahead of him Not one of them could get the contact on the ball That he wanted and the ball fell for him Once but twice and then he's left with a goalkeeper One-by-one and he clips it over him What a run and what a finish Brilliant determination Just kept going, kept going You realise there were flooding forward There was four or five into the attack He didn't need them Just bundled his way through the tackles From there is a cool finish Sat up nicely for him Phil Croatia have got a mountain to climb now Just looking around Clapping each other Trying to drive each other on Looking a little bit flat, a little bit dejected He was like Forrest Gump Just run Forrest, run He kept on, that's exactly what he did He kept on running and he was waiting for the tackle He couldn't quite get the tackle He wanted and it fell for him twice Couldn't believe it For the first 39 minutes of this game There's been no space and twice in the last four or five For Croatia wide open at the back And they've been punished The Argentina support now In the end behind the goal towards our left Are just bouncing Because Now I tell you what It's like Kodali should do Is she just go long now Because when they've been in this position Against Australia and the Netherlands Their opponents have left it late And then they've gone route one And Argentina on both occasions have had Hang on against Australia But the Netherlands threw about Begghorst Got it back from 2-0 down to 2-2 Extra time and penalties If Croatia now is messy comes forward Clipping the ball out towards the far side Here is Fernandez Fernandez on the left hand side Argentina are looking to try and finish it This is the McAllister DePaul shoots, takes a deflection Runs wide behind Corner kick, 2-0 Argentina I think it's fair to say there's not a matter of messy hamstring They're all over them now aren't they? They're swarming all over Croatia And you're saying about going long, they know They've just got to stay in the game now They've got four minutes to see this through It's a half time because this could go Very very ugly, very very quickly They were appealing for a handball But I don't think it struck anywhere near a hand From the shot from DePaul The Italian referee, I mean it will get checked It's a matter of course through VAR But Argentina are leading Croatia By two goals to nil And Argentina have a corner on that far side The left The referee is just calling someone towards him Now he gives permission for the corner kick To be taken on that far side A wall of noise inside The Lusail stadium If you're not bouncing up and down You're not Argentinian In comes the corner, the header What a save from Leverkovich What a reflex save Smiley down towards his left It might have... I don't think you've got the touch there Callister, was it? What a save Brilliant reactions, just kept them into competition Downward header, into the ground Just reactions and you get a touch And you just hope for your life You've got enough on it Boy did he, he had to That would have been curtains Certainly would Corner kick, downward header And a reflex save Smiley away to his left with a one handed save Corner kicker again to Argentina Leading by two goals to nil We're close to half time here on five live of BBC sounds And Argentina are certainly well set For a place in Sunday's final Messi to take the corner Left footed, it's an in swinger And Orkut won for Leverkovich to deal with All-In-Aries to punch them all away under pressure And Croatia are firmly on the back foot Looking really good at the back For the vast majority of this first half The last four or five minutes They've looked all over the place Conceded to very, very nearly three there Rob's right, they've just got to get through to half time Keeping it to a regroup Molina with the throw Stabs it forward, Messi gives it back Very, very tight but it works it away And then Molina is actually caught in possession But then he still manages to get a foot into the challenge To take it away from Kovacic It's a Croatian throw Just think now, kill the game Take your time over the throw in Enjoy the bit of ball that you can Enjoy the possession Enjoy just being in the Argentina half Because you need that breather You've got what, 80 seconds to see it through Argentina 2, Croatia 0 60 seconds of normal time in this first half Remaining And Croatia have not now scored first In any of their last nine Last 10 World Cup games Since the group stages Against Iceland in 2018 They're going to have to draw on all of their experience In tournament football At World Cups But they're going to have to do it the hard way here 2-0 down Gavadio And there's a little bit of pressure from De Paul Has to go all the way back Towards Livakovic Every task from Croatia is a back hook task At the minute, it's all under pressure Argentina have got the tails up They're chasing everything Croatia now with Kovacic in the centre circle Out to Sosa on this near side the left Sosa plays it back towards Kovacic Plays it in low Kramaric with the lay-off Back towards Kramaric Goes square Moderic with the shot Block comes back to Moderic Plays it out to Jurelovic Right hand side Jurelovic Beating out of the near post And tried to lift it forward with Kacilic Flag was up anyway But that was still a good save by Heming Martínez Because Jurelovic really did hit it low Hitted low, drilled it in towards his near post It just takes a deflection, doesn't it? Off Taglifico Then the keeper has to get down to his left hand side But that for me So, some Croatia open this first off Had a lot of the ball Dominated in the midfield Plenty of nice little passes But they've had no threat whatsoever Nothing on target They've not thrown a punch have they? No Well, at the last 21 times When a team has scored the opening goal In a World Cup knockout match Only four have failed to win Russia in the quarterfinal in 2018 England in the semi-final And Japan and Brazil this time The connection is that all have lost to Croatia But Croatia here Are 2-0 down in this semi-final And we have four minutes of additional time On five-live Argentina Have an eye on Sunday's final Back here in the Lusail stadium Will it be against France or Morocco It's live on BBC One tomorrow It's live on BBC Radio 5 Live on BBC Sounds And like this game Also on the World Service across Africa You just wonder with the game as it is at 2-0 And the history that they have in recent games For Argentina Whether they be that comfortable 2-0 up Yeah The next goal is absolutely vital Here is Molina Attack minded right back for Argentina Plays it back to DePaul Kovacic tries to get there first Messi though now takes over Knicks it back towards DePaul Getting into the challenge was Perishic Strikes Messi Messi working ever so hard Holding off Perishic And now Messi just runs in field And listens to the ovation From an inspiration to a whole country And an icon across the footballing world Played forward to Alvarez Alvarez will win a throw 2-0 Argentina He's been brilliant Alvarez He's been the threat He's the one that's running behind He's the one that's making it really uncomfortable Now for those Perishic defenders We talk about Messi But the way he's played in this first half With his goal And also in getting the penalty Being superb He's got the work rate He's got the pace And he's certainly got the goal threat That was evident with that second goal 2-0 to Argentina Kramaric runs away from DePaul Kramaric 25 yards out Left corner of the penalty area Perishic has been quite quiet by his standards Kills over a left foot across Drifts out of play No danger at all That again that storms them up It's a decent position to be in Perishic finds himself 1v1 He tries to move the ball out of that left foot And try and whip it in He actually puts it behind the goal Wasn't much of a threat in there anyway Just looking at the subs The options Tetyovic Is he going to be the Valkveg horse Of Croatia Well it was his goal wasn't it That got the equaliser With their only shot on target Against Brazil in the 117th minute The trouble tonight is that Croatia need 2 goals And Lionel Messi with his first Has moved level with Killing him Bapé On 5 in the race for the Golden Boot Might get the Golden Ball Get the Golden Boot But the one trophy that he wants the most Is the World Cup itself Especially after missing out in 2014 Had an hour with Lote Mateus last night And he wasn't best pleased that Messi Was about to equal his record And then go on and break it I'm sure Yeah well of course as you now have pointed out He could break it regardless couldn't he As here he is once more Did you know that Lote Mateus is 24% English Is that right? Where in Earth have you got that from? I bumped into him the other night Alright okay Well I didn't realise when I bumped into him Is that that little fat That was actually handed to him A watered to him by Kelly Kate Who's 11% English Despite her claims that she's Scottish Anyway the half time whistle has sounded And Argentina are leading by 2 goals to nil A messy penalty and then a surging run By Alvarez Messi with the first after 33 Alvarez made it 2, 6 minutes later And McAllister almost made it 3 So here is the 11% English Kelly Kate I would just like to say the board has moved a lot So there's a very strong chance that That northern English DNA is actually Scottish Under the changing board anyway This first half has been 100% pretty much Argentina And Alan I know you were talking about Julian Alvarez all the talk before And about Messi on the one hand And then Modric on the other But while you guys were working We were listening and the sound engineer next door Who's from Argentina Radio and I Were just on our feet It was incredible what a goal Yeah he's been superb he has I mean the way Messi found him on the half way line And it just sort of opened up for him Defenders didn't have the balance that they wanted They couldn't get the connection on the ball That they wanted and it fell for him twice And you can't afford to give that opportunity He's having a really really impressive World Cup and he's left with a goal Keep it a bit and he tooks it past him Really well and then he's been the difference He's the one that's had the energy up front He's the one that's been closing down And then he's got his reward with his goal He's been superb Something's not changing football You talk about skill, you talk about tactics That willingness, that willingness just to go I'm just going to go and take a chance First without the ball, then with the ball It creates both goals Rob I was surprised at how fast Croatia And attacking Croatia came I think there was an expectation That they were going to be a bit cagey than that But it isn't how they, even if there was Very little end product, it isn't how they approached the game No they're open, they're playing They're playing the football, they're doing the thing And you just feel they're so good in there So comfortable in the midfield three And they get the ball and then it goes to Either Sosa on the left or Joranovic on the right Or then you're talking about Kameric up front And he just drops a level And you're feeling that Argentina sit there and go Right, and they set up for it They went right, we're going to sit narrow as a four in midfield And you can have it anywhere Apart from near our goal And you guys can, you're fine Because we know that you've not got that quality And that's where it's kind of fallen short They've just not got the players of the three In the middle of the park Rob Green and Alan Shearer are part of your commentary team Alongside Ian Dennis who mid half time snack Is probably about 75% twix At the moment we're also joined by South America And football correspondent Tim Vickery Tim is that the game do you think Argentina were expecting here? Pretty much, I was enjoying it while it was 0-0 Before we'd had a clear chance There was something almost like reassuring Eretto about it It was like going back to Italian 90 or something With the patients that both sides had on the ball And Croatia as you may have said looking so comfortable But, we told you before the game It's not necessarily all about Messi There's signs of a future here in Argentina In that link up between Enzo Fernandez and Julian Alvarez And where is the deadlock broken? Through that link up It's a wonderful pass from Fernandez who was driving them forward They had the first shot forcing a save And it's a terrific pass to Alvarez That gives him the chance to win the penalty Fascinating now, what can Croatia do about it? Surely Petkovic comes on Argentina have struggled against sides who have gone root 1 against them And something that's always been hanging over this Argentina World Cup campaign Just that tired of emotion It's almost insane And it can inspire the team But there's always a worry if it can inhibit as well If it can frighten because sometimes when Argentina have looked to have Wins snatched away from them against Australia, against Holland The nervousness of the crowd transmits itself to the field It's as if everyone there on the Argentina side Is on the verge of a collective nervous breakdown Can Croatia force Argentina to be nervous? That for me is the big question about the second half Tim Vickery, for now, thank you very much Tim started off by talking about the future for Argentina Without Leonel Messi The worst signs that his hamstring might be bothering him a little bit in that first half And actually Jason Berter, the telegraph has tweeted That he's gone down the tunnel just clutching on to his hamstring So we'll see how that one plays out as far as the second half We're going to go in two-nil up at half-time against Croatia In the semi-final of the World Cup The first semi-final of this World Cup The second of them comes tomorrow, it's France against Morocco We'll have build up to that one after the BBC News with Tim Stier Take the World Cup with you Cat Art 2022 On BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live The United Nations Refugee Agency has criticised the Prime Minister's new migrant policies Rishi Sunak has promised more staff to help clear the UK's backlog of asylum claims A dedicated unit to handle Albanian applications And new laws to make it clear that if people enter the country illegally They will be sent home The UN said plans to limit access to only those arriving by a safe and legal route Went against its refugee convention Mr Sunak told the BBC his policies were vital What's more fundamental than getting through the backlog quickly Stopping people coming here in the first place illegally That's what people want to see, that's what I want to deliver I'm as frustrated as anybody when I see these pictures on our TV screens That's what's putting pressure on the system, leading to the backlog Putting people in hotels, putting pressure on public services All of that is wrong Scientists in the US have made a major breakthrough in the pursuit of what has been called the Holy Grail of energy production Researchers recreating nuclear fusion in a lab were able to produce more energy from the process Than was needed to start it If scientists perfect the technology It would provide a source of near limitless clean energy The Bank of England has estimated that 4 million UK households will face higher mortgage payments next year With a typical payment going up by £250 In a report it predicted the average bill will reach £1,000 And the reality TV contestant Stephen Bear has been found guilty of charges Which include disclosing a private sexual film The 2016 Celebrity Big Brother winner had shared a CCTV video of himself And fellow reality TV star Georgia Harrison on the website only fans Effectively selling it for money, he had denied the charges The third test starts Saturday morning from 4.25 on 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sound Brilliant solo goal by Julian Alvarez has given them the advantage We'll bring you second half commentary very shortly And then on Wednesday night, tomorrow night, 5 Live will bring you commentary of the other semifinal between France and Morocco All the build up from 6 o'clock, kick off is at 7 We can hear from Morocco's Ilias Chair in just a moment First though, here's France captain Hugo Loires It's already a success for Morocco to be at this stage of the competition But believe me, they won't stop They just want to carry on and become even more heroes for all the Moroccan country So we prepared the game to respond to the demand of a semifinal of the World Cup It doesn't matter who is the opponent We just tried to put the focus, the energy, the concentration and all of strength to this game To make sure that we will not have any regrets at the end We are thinking about something bigger than we can imagine So before we came here, all the people outside of our little bubble They said, oh yeah, we have Croatia, we have Belgium So if you can get maybe three or four points, that would be enough But we got first out of the group Then you got Spain that arguably was playing the best football at the moment Out as well Then you got Portugal, arguably the best player to ever play the game Out as well So now we're going to face a new challenge which is France And hopefully we can deliver as well and go and achieve something crazy Leading the commentary of France against Morocco tomorrow will be John Murray And we can also talk to Moroccan football journalist Jalal Boonwa Who is in Casablanca at the moment John Murray sitting next to me at the Lusail stadium John ahead of the game tomorrow as we've been hearing and as Hugo Larisse said Morocco will feel that this is success just to be at the semi-final That doesn't mean that France can expect them to sit back and just be happy to be there No, that's right And what is brilliant about this match tomorrow is for me that the history element to it And we've talked about it endlessly, haven't we? But they're there now, that's where they are And what we will see is something that's never been witnessed before An African team in the semi-finals of the World Cup And actually, if they're able to get through, they would be the first finalists at the World Cup From outside Europe or South America So there's even more history potentially waiting for them there But it's interesting, Waleed Redraghi who's been speaking today, their coach Has been saying things like they used to think that African teams were fun And then they got knocked out of the World Cup He said that's not the case anymore He said, I thought we had 0.01% of winning the World Cup at the start Now it's 0.03% However, he said we're not here to kid around And he said we're not tired But when you look at the injured players that they've got, Aghared Doubt with a thigh injury, Sice the captain, a doubt with a thigh injury Amrabat's got a back problem Masraoui's got a problem with his hip ZX taking a couple of knocks They're without their willing number 21 The substitute striker Shadiyere who will be suspended But they've got something going And clearly they are the underdogs to a huge degree But they're in it And you have to say because they're in it, they can win it Jalal at every stage it feels as though Morocco may have had a player out through injury A player suspended, they're going into the next game They've expended too much emotional energy This might be a step too far And yet, here they are at the semi-finals So how are people in Morocco feeling ahead of this match against France? Well, thanks so much for inviting me to talk about the tomorrow's game As said in the introduction, for sure it's a historical moment History is being rewritten there in Qatar in this World Cup Moroccans are optimistic and hopeful That we can go for another historical victory over the champions of the last edition And I think that the fans here in Morocco believe that the team will reach the final It's possible, everything is possible As what Ida Rue-Gregi said in the press conference today That our players are still angry As mentioned before by you, it's that there is a problem of some injuries And some absentees in tomorrow's game Luckily today, we have seen the participation of Noseir Mezrawi Bayer mentions right back and also Sayyidz, the captain of the national team They have participated in today's training session, which is good So I think only one player who probably will not take part in the game I'm talking about Naif Akred who did not participate in today's training session Naif Akred, the defender of West Ham And of course, as you said before, Shidira who got a red card So as I said, here in Morocco we believe that as we were able to eliminate Portugal and Spain And also Belgium before, we have all the chance to beat France, why not? We just need to be ready physically and concentrate during the game So reaching for me this semi-finals is a big achievement And tomorrow it's a very, very tough game, it will be a tactical game As well as the Regragi will probably try to lead the ball to France to play And try to defend and rely on counter-attack We may also see the Moroccan team going into attack and trying to score and didn't defend So Regragi has for sure studied very well France And will try to stop them at the level of the midfield So Moroccan midfield line led by Sufiana Murabac, the midfielder of Fiorentina Will try to make pressure on France's playmakers Talking about Moussa Dimbili, also talking about Kinian Bappe So as what Regragi said, if France does not score in the first half Our chances will be bigger to qualify to the final My fear as I said is that probably some players will get tired physically in the second half Because of the injury, but I think that Hakim Zeyek will take part Captain Seyes will take part in addition to Bayer Munchen's right back Moussa Erbezrawi That's it Jalal, it's been fascinating talking to you, really appreciate you coming on But they're about to kick off in the second half of the first semi-final So looking forward to seeing what Morocco have to offer tomorrow in their semi-final Against France, it's going to be huge celebrations if they do manage to reach the World Cup final We're bringing full commentary of that on 5LiveSport, meanwhile Second half, about to get underway at the Liseil Stadium, Argentina, Lecroix, by 2 goals to nil commentary team for this one, Rob Green, Alan Shearer and Ian Dennis There's little message as Massage is his hamstring, heading towards the start of the second half Thanks Kelly, yeah, back underway and I can tell you straight away that Croatia have made a double change And it's Nicola Blasic who's come on and Mislav Orsic who has also come on to the field of play Mario Pashalic is one of the players going off and the other one is the left back, Borna Sosa So that means that they're going to have to change things around, in fact Perishic has dropped to left back So that's the change for Croatia, so they have Leverkovic in goal, Gyuranovic at right back Lovren and Gavardiola are two central defenders, Perishic now drops back to left back Orsic will play on the left of the field, Kovacic, Modric with then Blasic on the right And Kramaric's through the middle, so that's how they've changed things around As they look to try and come from 2-0 down, against an Argentina side Croatia playing from left to right as we look in this second half, predominantly in navy blue That's a little bit of a run there from Blasic and he is felled and he's a free kick Argentina from right to left in their blue and sky blue striped shirts and white shorts With Emi Martinez in goal, the back four of Molina, Otomendi, Romero and Talia Fico Ferreiras, Fernandez, De Paul and Micalas are in the midfield, Messi and Alvarez The two players who've got the goals each to give Argentina this cushion And a comfortable lead early on the second half as Emi Martinez has to just quickly line up Just one in the wall and that's Messi, he's telling him where to stand Moderich stands over this as well, it's about 10-12 yards in from the right such line Again the line is up on the edge of the penalty area, as much protection as possible But with Argentina leading 2-0 on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds This next goal is going to be crucial, Moderich to take it, he goes deep towards the far side Well claimed by the goalkeeper, Rob Green Fantastic claim, Moderich saw at the far post, they had a man over, a man spare Aimed for it, I think Martin has read it as well, quick feet, good hands And what about the changes Alan? Well they had to do something Deno didn't they because they've got to try and now chase the game a little bit I know we said it 1-0, they're fine, they're used to that, they've come back from that But they've got to do it a different matter, they've got to open up a little bit and gamble Alan Shearer and Rob Green, two former England internationals who are with us here on BBC Radio 5 Live And BBC Sounds tonight, we're also across Africa on the World Service And Argentina are on course for Sunday's final here in Lusail Against either France or Morocco, live on BBC One tomorrow But also 5 Live commentary will be available through Wealth Cup Extra on the iPlayer McAllister sent away on the left hand side, level the area 3 minutes after the restart Place it inside, Messi takes it on his right foot, challenge comes in from Covacic Tries to win it back as Messi, they hound Brozovic and they have got it through McAllister McAllister then goes down outside the deep, DePaul holds onto it, plays a reverse ball Paredes with the shots and it's saved by the goalkeeper, Liver Kovic There is a clear desire from Argentina not to allow Croatia back into this game as they have in the previous two knockouts In Croatia having to come out that a little bit more, that should suit Argentina with the players that they have Up front with McAllister, bursting down the left hand side then In fact he is still down in the middle of the park I think it is, he was looking for a free kick when he was dribbling that ball across the AXE in the odd box But it should suit Argentina, the way Croatia have to open up Just wonder, if we haven't seen how a shot is argued yet, so there is not a lot to back this up with If Croatia do nick a goal, it has been a real party atmosphere in here tonight, that will change Yes it will, we have already seen that against Australia, certainly a witness did first hand on Friday here inside this stadium against the Netherlands But at the minute those who are decked out in the red and white checkered shirts away towards our right hand side are silent at the moment But Bruno Peckovich is going to be coming on and he is going to be replacing Brozovic So another clear sign with a striker coming on for a midfielder But Peckovich who got that 117th minute equaliser against Brazil His fifth appearance, four of them have been off the bench so far in this World Cup The player from Dino Bozakret goes up front and Croatia might have to start going a little bit more direct as they trail by two goals to nil That change being made just five minutes into this second half So, Kovičić out to Joranovic on this near side, he rolls in towards Peckovich looking towards Kramarić Cleared then by Molina, the right back, quite narrow that back for there for Argentina Gavadiole has it, he's had such an excellent tournament, the young central defender Here is Kovičić coming forward towards Moderic, what can Moderic do, this midfield maestro As the ball is played out towards the left hand side, Perišić goes ahead of him Looking to try and link up with Orsič, here is Peckovich, lays it off, Moderic in the 50-50 Loses out and the break is on and it's with Fernandez who will run forward Fernandez in the end, it just loses out there to Vlasić who tracks his run So much urgency now from Croatia, they've got nothing else but to give it a go Trailing by two goals to nil, Vlasić, Moderic in close attendance, here he is Left put it, high ball out towards that far side, headed back by Kramarić Ball inside now to Kovičić, forward, Peckovich couldn't turn, challenge from Moderic And Argentina win the ball back, he's got to do better than that, it's a simple ball into his feet He's got to keep that ball and bring players into the game Ball is rolled out, wouldn't quite reach Peckovich, it was the interception From Paredes there for Argentina, been won back by Croatia Here is Moderic, Kovičić, forward ball, Peckovich trying to roll away from his man Kovičić looking towards the run of Orsič in the midfield Croatia now with a cross, Vlasić is ball, takes an eclection caught by the keeper Already they're asking more questions about back four of Argentina, there's more movement in there There's more bodies in there, trying to get the little given goals in there So yeah, they've gambled which is what they had to do Did you not think Kovičić should shoot there, he's got the ball in the edge of the box Should need an invite, should he? 2-0 to Argentina, headed away by Peckovich now playing as a left back Argentina, 8 minutes into this second half, a little bit of a stumble But Kovičić kept his balance, then gets the ball back, Salinga Dupo, he was fouled as the Italian referee Daniel Lozato and it will be a free kick to Croatia inside their own half It's going to be really interesting to watch Modrić and Kovičić in there together now Because they can just bounce balls off each other all the evening really And as I say that, Modrić gives it away for the first time in a night Throw on that far side, all about game management now from an Argentina point of view Yeah, absolutely, that's what they've got to do, they know that there's going to be spaces up front when they win it back They're going to be content to let Croatia have that and hope that they can hit them on the break Which of course they'll be able to do that Here is Modrić Back inside with Orsic, Juranovic on this right hand side He was quickly closed down by Talia Fico, Lovren inside the Argentina half Juranovic plays the diagonal ball, Tekovic, who's a big lump of a striker He's about 6'4, quite cumbersome, certainly he's been a 2 or 3 heavy touch since he's come on As he now makes his way up front and the ball is switched by Lovren out towards that far side But it's well over the head of Paracic He speaks highly of you then, huh? He probably said I'm a big lump but I'm about 6'2 Probably say a lot worse than that, cumbersome wasn't the word I was thinking of I'm not asking you by the way I'm not asking you either I look across the commentary box and I'm not asking anybody Here is Modrić 10 minutes into the second half here on 5 live and BBC sounds And still the Argentinian supporters are bouncing up and down Blasic Easily Well handled by Otta Mendi, it'll be an Argentina throw Blasic, he was unloaded Torino from West Ham United, struggled at West Ham, never really happened for him either at Everton And in fact even with Mislav Orsic, or whilst he's done well for Dino Mozagreb this season He has not been able to translate that onto the international stage So they don't really have the players of pedigree Who are proven at this level to trouble Argentina Mind you, people in Bernal will be saying about Veghorst And here's two goals in that quarter final But they are 2-0 down and Croatia seeing a lot of the ball Up towards Blasic, tries to get it into Petkovic But brought away by McAllister Hits it over the top Alvarez now, 1-1 against Lovren Alvarez enters the penalty area He looks for the run at Fernandez And Croatia have done just enough, but it's won back by Lionel Messi, left hand side of the penalty area Now he waits for those white and sky blue striped shirts to get forward And Croatia have pinned back as they trail by Tugolsternil Fernandez inside to McAllister Rolls it into a central area Paredes goes out wide to the Argentinian right DePaul is there, Molina is ahead of him Just in from that right touch line Molina will run forward And he continues to go as he wraps it a low cross But it's dealt with by Guardiol And they should play their way out of this But they're under pressure still There is McAllister and Jiranovic Eventually will get it away, but he's over hit that And Stepping forward was automating And Argentina have it once more with Fernandez I thought he should have shot early Wonderful ball over the top For Alvarez to run on to And he put it into Fernandez's path But he chose to take it touch instead of having a pop at goal That ball out ball for Alvarez against Lovren, that is the ball for Argentina Argentina with Messi, central position Lovely close control, his left foot turns on the edge of the area Flick inside, Fernandez back towards Messi Messi gets the shot away, left footed Beaten out by Liverkowicz That would have been an exceptional goal Great skill from him again, the way he caresses the ball He takes it away from Guardiol and then gets it lit back And then the touch on to goal He just couldn't get it across the goalkeeper Goes straight at him instead of across him Brilliant play to get in there in the first place though Croatia coming forward now Argentina are going to be looking to try and make a change The shot near to the area is charged down That was from Orsic, spins out towards Yuranovic Modric now takes over, Vlasic right corner of the area Clips it in, Petkovich brings it under control Couldn't turn, they get it away as far as Kramaric With his back heel to Kovacic, knocking on the door Perishic lets it run through Orsic with the cross, headed out by Otomendi Picked up by Kovacic, you're thinking from a neutral If Croatia can reduce the areas We could have a real houndinger for the next half an hour Certainly Tesla nerves from Argentina having what happened in their last game With that without a doubt it could be on the mind if Croatia were to get that one goal Lissandra Martinez, Vancescu Naisi waits to come on down below Argentina are going to be making a change It's just interesting to see their reaction now Now that Croatia are playing with the two up front Suggests that they go to a back three Give them the overload, give them that bit of comfort That's security blanket back there I think for the first time tonight we can hear Croatian voices They're encouraged as they look to see their side Get a goal back as they trail by two goals to nil Argentina clear and then Messi comes in off that right touch line on that far side Playing from right to left, Paredes comes forward Laid off by Fernandez, Messi tried to play it forward first time Lobrin though closed him down and then McAllister is turned But Messi is 35 years of age, he's not going to get on the end of that one No, he just had a look to his left hand side and thought Messi was going to run in Messi thought otherwise and stopped Kramaric comes towards the halfway line Now to Perisic on that far side Kovacic on the halfway line Moderic still deep Invites Barriol to come forward And the central defender carries the ball midway through the Argentina half But he's bundled off by Alvarez That's the work off the ball that Alvarez is also providing tonight He's been magnificent, don't know how to do his shift For the team defensively as well, the way he puts defenders or midfielders under pressure He does a lot of Messi's running, you know, when Messi's walking around He's the one that is actually hurrying and hassling midfielders and defenders To force them into that error Argentina has scored first in all six ties at this World Cup When they squandered the Tugol lead against the Netherlands It was the first time that they'd actually failed to win Tells you everything about their pedigree As they're looking to reach a sixth World Cup final And their supporters know that as every minute ticks by They're a step closer to being back here in the Lusail stadium In the city of Lusail, nine miles north of Doha The World Cup final coverage begins at midday ahead of the three o'clock on Sunday We've got the second semi tomorrow on Five Live We've got Thursday night, the Scottish Premiership ranges hips from eight And then next week, fourth round league cup action Tuesday, MK Don's, all trap at Wednesday and the Etihad on Thursday And the Premier League back on Five Live on Boxing Day Five Live and Vignici sounds for your live football And the fact that Paredes is the one who's coming off For Lisandro Martinez would suggest Rob that that is exactly what they're going to do What he'd suggest it Yep, three in the back and then the two in midfield They'll be sat there, they'll just drop a bit narrow, a bit tighter Alvarez probably, I'd imagine, dropping back in again And harrying and working around the midfield as well for that extra body 62 minutes play, Croatia have a free kick, far side the left Modric to take it, lifts it in right foot in Lovren with a downward header, pushed out by the goalkeeper And then cleared away Lovren just couldn't direct it, goalwards enough Good ball in from Modric from that left hand side Puts it right on top of the defenders and the goalkeeper They've all got decisions to make Lovren just couldn't get that head away, could he? And Martinez, the Aspen Guller keeper Twisted away with both hands McAllister to the Sandra Martinez Fernandez back with the Sandra Martinez once again Talia Fico now as the left wing back Molina as the right wing back with that change being made by Lino Scoloni The former West Hand defender, 17 appearances he made in 2006 As Talia Fico looks to link up with Alvarez Here he is on this near side the left And Alvarez with a crossfield pass towards Molina Heading forward to Messi on that far side And Parashic just leans into him And out of play it goes for a throw He's a really intelligent player, no Alvarez The way he finds that space, the way he just caressed that ball When it was sort of fizzed into him with pace Really intelligent Yuranovich starts forward from right back for Croatia With a challenge from Talia Fico And the loose ball now picked up by McAllister over the halfway line McAllister goes short and square Then gets the return ball back And he's been held back by Yuranovich And it will be a free kick to Argentina Rob Now you get the feeling now the game is poised as such Perhaps it's one good pass away from either being on a cliffhanger or over And you're just looking at the way that Croatia are pressing Can they find that bit of quality into the box? Argentina can they exploit the gaps? It's one pass, that's all it is Croatia who are competing in their third semi-final In the sixth World Cup, 98 and 2018 As England fans know only too well But here trailing by two goals to nil First half goals from a messy penalty and Alvarez And that is the task that faces Croatia As we are approaching the midway point of this second half Under a half moon in Lusail in Qatar Fernandez back it goes Romero on that far side Plays it short and forward Messy, delight by Messy Plays it now inside to Fernandez Messy wants the return ball But it's gone to, Vlasic for Croatia Free kick in favour of him Some of his touches tonight have just been a delight It's a blime on me Just the way he protects the ball The way he's his ability to run with it Those little quick short steps Incredible He should have been booked there though Pulling back, holding back clearly The Spanish referee Antonio Matiola-Hose Who was taking charge of Friday Didn't want to book Should have booked him for a clear handball Didn't, eventually had to show him a yellow card in the end Kramaric shields the ball on the edge of the area Croatia still have the ball But they're forced away from the penalty box Away towards our right-hand side Talia Fico gets the challenge in And the break, he's on for Argentina And it's Alvarez, Talia Fico streaking ahead of him Instead he crosses the ball out towards the ball Right-hand side Messy's loitering on the edge of the area Molina's joining the over attack De Paul clips over the cross Messy, despite his diminutive figure Losing out in the aerial duel with Lovren And Moderic will try and bring it away And there's a foul on Moderic And there's a wave of the hand from Nino Scoloni He disagrees with that decision Pre-kick to Croatia, Alan Shearer That's magnificent again though from Alvarez He actually, he's the one that puts the ball From the left to the right-hand side Then they lose the ball Then it's him that's tracking back And he's got no option but to foul Moderic I mean, it's a really clever foul But for him to get back there anyway Just sums up his attitude This is Kovacic to Moderic Central position, midway through the Argentina half Kovacic tries to drive forward Fernandez tracks it Out it goes to Perichic, far side the left Perichic back to Kovacic once again Running in field now is Orsic Looking to link up with Petkovic And that was a foul And Argentina's defence stands firm It's all in front of Argentina from Croatia It's all into feet It's all, there's no running in behind There's no, there's no people No defenders having to turn their heads They're not asking any different questions It's still not a shot target And time is slowly but surely ticking away from them Third meeting in a World Cup First in the knockout stages But Argentina who've never been eliminated At a semi-final stage before They've won all four And they're leading by two goals to nil Alvarez holding at the ball ever so well On his lonesome, battling away Kovacic, he's impressed you tonight, hasn't he? I really don't like Frasier than anyone for hard work But this guy is taking it to a new level He's actually doing so much of Messi's Running as well in terms of the closing down Which is fine because when Messi gets the ball He's a threat, and a real threat But the running off the ball like this guy is doing Is incredible, really is Christian Romero of Toplum-Hotspur Has just been shown a yellow card For coming into the back of Petkovic He is the first of the Argentinian players To be shown a yellow we had Two in the first half for Leverkovic and Kovacic For Croatia Still 2-0 And we're midway through the second half Here on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds Grameric loses the ball on the left-hand side Argentina get a throw You'd have to set mind you You're saying this against the Netherlands on Friday But you can't see at the minute Croatia troubling Argentina On the balance of play that we've seen so far No, but the best chance that they've had Was from the free kick from Modric in to Auburn And he just didn't bounce for him And that's it, really there's not been a moment Where the hearts of the Argentinians melt Messi running forward for Argentina Twisting and turning And finding his way into the penalty area And with a cut back to Alvarez But it was all about little Messi That was just wonderful He was at his mercurial best And Alvarez set the ball in There's no way back for Croatia Argentina's world country is still alive They lead Croatia 3-0 Absolutely sensational from Lionel Messi We talked about his ability to run with the ball To go past defenders, he stops the defender He goes past him, he then stops him again He's got the ability to hit him back in for a tackle He goes past him again Then he's got the ability to pick his head up In such a tight situation And the understanding and the relationship That he has with Alvarez He looks up, he picks him up Thank you very much, have a tap in For all your work you've done, you deserve that What a goal 40-50 yard run Just down the wing driving in Just the strength And then the ability To start the game That has started here in the La Salle And I can imagine that it started Back home in Argentina Close your eyes and you can be forgiven For thinking in Buenos Aires They will be going mad back home Because Lionel Messi with that assist Has equaled Diego Maradona's record Of eight assists at a World Cup We are witnessing one of the Greatest players in the world It's going to be gracing Sunday's World Cup final I'm lost for words Because so many times you see Different players get into that situation Not have the ability to get there And pick their head up and pick the pass Hit the front man or hit the goalkeeper But he knows the defender can't touch him So he goes past him not once But actually twice But then to have the ability and skill to pick his head up And say there you go For all your work, for all your effort Done for me and done for this team Have it on a plate And he sticks it away so perfectly well Just brilliant And Argentina Three-nil with 19 minutes remaining Croatia are going to have to produce Something extra special That only two nations have ever done before In the history of the World Cup And they have very little time in order to do it And Lino Scoloni Who Has resurrected the Argentinian fortune Since he took charge in 2018 He produced their first major trophy in 28 years When he won the Copa America in 2021 And now Sees his side lead by three goals to nil And Kramaric is coming off Croatia are making a change And Lvivaya, Marco Lvivaya is going to be coming on He scored against Canada He's a forward, it's like for like And also there's going to be a change as well With Esquial Palacios With Vilder for Bayer-Leber-Kuzum He's going to be coming on for Argentina It's his third appearance in this World Cup They've all been off the bench They're going to wait for the Croatia free kick Before that change happens As Paracic goes from long range Must have been a good 35 yards out He hit it true enough Left put it, but it was comfortably saved By Emi Martinez, Rob Back to himself, the goalkeeper He only put two men in the wall and said go on It's good if I have to get something special He's been stood watching And waiting For the best part of the game For a shot, finally gets one Not only are they just jumping up and down They're bobbing from side to side In every row In this stadium that holds Over 88,000 people If you're wearing a blue and white Striped shirt Then you're not standing still And now here comes the change with Palacios Palacios Wouldn't surprise me If I took one of the forwards off, you know Number 10 90 or 10 It's going to be a double change It's going to be the first player to come off Is De Paul He had been a fitness doubt going into The quarterfinal against the Netherlands He is such a key player He's industrious, he's creative Rodrigo De Paul of Atlético Madrid He will come off, he'll be replaced there By Palacios, like Palac in the In the midfield And then the other player is going to be coming on Is De Barla For his first outing at this World Cup And it's Alvarez who's gone off And just as he did against the Netherlands A lovely ovation for Alvarez There will be no World Cup hat-trick In this semi-final But what an influence he has made on this game Two goals And he got the penalty for Messi It really has been such an Impressive performance for him Not only in this game But in the others as well to help to get Argentina where they're about to go Which is the World Cup final He has more than played his part He's the perfect foil isn't he? He brings everything that Is wonderful as Messi is He brings the other side of it Well, so well together Listen to the noise inside the Lusseil Stadium They are dreaming Generations of supporters Of a third World Cup triumph They've had to wait 36 years There's a long-range effort flashed in From distance again by Perichic They reached the final in 2014 But this time they do believe Building on the success Of the Copper America That ironically was achieved in American art in 2021 88,966 Full capacity inside the Lusseil Stadium Certainly over two-thirds of them Are from South America They'll be hanging around In the souk And other parts of Qatar For just a few more days As Emi Martinez goes along And we have 14 minutes Remaining The question is Who Will they face in Sunday's final Messi With a little layoff Nicked into the path of McAllister Played back to Fernandez Talia Fico On the overlap was Palacios not required Instead they switch it to the right In fact, this defeat Is actually Croatia's record World Cup defeat Because previously they'd lost 3-1 to Brazil and Mexico In 2014 You have to say that You look at the Argentinian back line And you wouldn't say anyone's been Outstanding in there, they've done fine But they just haven't been tested They haven't had to play, have they Rob? Not really had to do a lot of defending No balls into the box with real quality No balls up to the forwards With any quality And they've looked comfortable all evening That's Alan Sheeran And Rob Green who are with us here On BBC Radio 5 Live I think the atmosphere Might sound a little different next Tuesday At Stadium MK When we return to domestic duties And we're bringing you the first Of three successive nights of League Cup action It might seem a little hollow In comparison to 50,000 Argentinians Singing here With 12 minutes remaining It's getting colder Can't believe you're not going to Newcastle Have a word with the editor Have you noticed how he flaked the blame Giving away by Argentina Perisic will just about keep That ball in play on the far side We will be at Newcastle though On New Year's Eve as Croatia Have a shot from distance and it drifts away From the all six So if you are listening to 5 Live For the first time during our World Cup coverage And you haven't yet sampled our Domestic coverage Then New Year's Eve, Newcastle United Against League United with the usual Goal service, we will be at St James's Park Question is Where will you be? I'll be in the match of the day studio Covering it also And that will be part of Match of the Days Live program Tomorrow Night France against Morocco And our coverage on 5 Live With Mark Chapman from 6 At the Albat Stadium France Against Morocco And then on Sunday our World Cup Final coverage begins At midday And even with 11 minutes of normal time remaining With a scoreline of 3 goals to nil You can say with real certainty That Argentina will be awaiting The winners of that game tomorrow night Alba Reyes with 2 goals Messi with the first As Guardiola at the back Plays it towards Lovren And Croatia's hopes Are becoming the fourth European nation To reach consecutive finals Falling short, they won't be able To match the run of Italy The Dutch and Germany Who are the last side to do it As here is Modric Can't believe you doubted it After 25 minutes When you said you always get goals Are ashore when I've been on You doubted it didn't you? I was saying that with certainty Here is Modric Came back and rebounded off him And hit him in the face The challenge that was closed down by McAllister after 2 epic nights at Anfield By the way I know The Liverpool fans still going about That Barcelona game 10 minutes remaining though And there's going to be no dramatic An occasion for Croatia Colin Murray follows at 10 o'clock Will dissect it of course And don't forget the World Cup Daily podcast I think it's day 24 today Since we've been out in Qatar Available through BBC Sounds 10 minutes remaining And this is I would imagine Where Argentina are thinking right The game saved Why is Messi still on the pitch? It's been terrific tonight Yeah? Do you need him for the final? Yeah? Are you in the final? Yeah? Get him off the pitch Don't always do it on there There's no chance he's coming off Lothar Matthias will know that he'll be breaking His record in the World Cup final With his 26th appearance At a World Cup He will stand alone And he will want to stand alone When he lifts the trophy Because that's what he'll be dreaming about And Moderic now is being replaced And we said before that Messi and Moderic in their previous 26 meetings It was Moderic who had had the upper hand But as far as little Messi is concerned Tonight is the perfect 10 With his 10th success Out of meeting 27 And Scaloni just looked over to Messi You know? He just asked him What do you want to do? I wasn't sure of the reaction Where he said no I'm happy on here or I'm coming off But he definitely asked him Well bearing in mind in the first half We were thinking that maybe He'd tweet to Hamstring on his left leg But 8 minutes remain Argentina 3-0 3-0 And they are aside Going into that final Really in form They have lost only one of their last 42 And that was against Saudi Arabia When Saudi Arabia pulling off that shock Ended their 36th match Undefeated run Seems a long way Long time ago now doesn't it that? But bearing in mind in that second group game They then going into that match Against Mexico Were under real pressure Came through it Winning it by 2 goals still Scored first in every game And they are heading through To a 6th final The ball is lifted forward And there was a chance there for A fourth goal And it was McAllister right footed 12 yards out who followed it right footed Why? They get a little look with the deflection And then it falls to him Very kindly there He's watching the ball come right across them To hit it with the front of his right foot He goes about 2 foot wide God now, Christia, haven't they? The game's gone, they've gone They didn't react to that at all They just stood and watched I think McAllister could have had more time Then he thought he went for the volley The ball played forward Knicks away out of the path Of Perishic on that far side And it will be a Throw to Croatia level The penalty area on the left 7 minutes remaining This is Maya couldn't get into the path Of Komacic, Messi over the half way line Layed back Back towards Messi Plays it forward Now it's with Molina on that right hand side And unable to Make the run into the penalty box With Tabala And Croatia can bring it away So it's 6 World Cup Finals for Argentina It's a record Only bettered by Germany With 8 As Croatia looking for a consolation Nassandra Martinez steps forward And wins it with a biting challenge Messi was probably coming back from an offside position The move breaks down, 6 minutes remaining Argentina, they have 3 goals The good And looking very comfortable, managing the game really well Messi's playing, giving go football He's not really Exerting himself anymore Getting it, passing it straight to someone else Using himself as a bit of a wall Protecting himself and looking after himself also 3 goals tonight By my calculations that takes it to 161 For the tournament overall Cross comes in from the left And then 2 headers see it behind For a corner kick to prevent it reaching So they're actually For this tournament, they're 10 away from the overall Highest, which was 171 In 98 And Brazil in 2014 Croatia still looking for a consolation Argentina are looking to make A double change Down below Giving a little bit of a run out Juan Foyt, the former Tottenham player Will be getting his first appearance Of this World Cup The corner flicks on and at the far post Lovren couldn't latch onto the end of it Really good execution Just inches away Sums up their efforts tonight Close at times Not close enough Very deflating End for Croatia In this tournament Worked so hard to get here Against all the odds Against Brazil Set form And the fantastic team Limped it out Who's not limping out They put in enough energy with the supporters They're still going strong Here are a couple of players To make their first appearance At this World Cup Angle Correa, who plays for Atletico Madrid He replaced Nicolas Gonzalez Ahead of the tournament Who pulled out with a muscle injury So he's a right winger or a forward He's coming on And Molina is the other player Molina and McAllister come off And so Juan Foyth will replace Molina Tottenham player now at Virial Very limited football this season Due to a knee injury Only five appearances for the Spanish side So Juan Foyth comes on Right back for Molina And Correa comes on To replace Alexis McAllister And so Messi staying on He wants to have that moment right at the end Man, it will be petrified Every time the ball goes near him And the hope that nothing happens to him In the last what we got Four or five minutes left of normal time There was a moment earlier Where Perisic just caught him A little bit on the touch line Nothing major but immediately Very on Perisic's like Apologised straight away Apologised again Just over three minutes of normal time Remaining Talia Fico gets on the end Of the long clearance by Emi Martinez The baller tries to challenge Yuranovic and it Comes off the Celtic player And Talia Fico will take the throw Talia Fico might not even Appear in Sunday's final Because Acuña will be Back from suspension So for Nicholas Talia Fico He started Every game In Russia in 2018 That is one of the areas That Scoloni is going to have to make That judgement call Two minutes remaining And once again the wonderful Noise of the Argentinian Supporters reverberates around The LaSalle stadium The other night you know They were still here about half an hour after the game They didn't leave What an atmosphere So many of them here Everywhere you go Is a blue and white top Really is amazing They're having a great time And saw the should when their teams The country is putting in a performance like this The beauty of it is Is that unlike Australia and the Netherlands In the previous two knockouts Sages they weren't able to enjoy that From a fans point of view Yet here they're 3-0 up And they know they're going to be back here on Sunday From the 69th minute onwards Wasn't it? You knew that the game Was up, you knew that The Japanese was out of it Doesn't happen often as a football fan You can sit back and relax and enjoy A good 20 minutes half hour football Messi and Di Maria The only survivors From that World Cup final defeat As Maia hits an effort Took a little bit of reflection But they still made the save They're the only two players Of the survivors from that World Cup final Defeat in Brazil 8 years ago And they've got a chance Well Di Maria is actually retiring Isn't it from the international stage After the World Cup They could finally have their crown in moment What a story that could be Would have put an end to the debate Maradona, Messi That's the debate that Lady Kelly Might be starting with you very very soon I'm sure you've had it on the The match of the day Top 10, have you not? Yeah we have And what did you go with? Well we said if Messi actually wins this Then it might have to be him That's been the difference That's been the splitting point, hasn't it? Maradona won the World Cup For us, well If he were to win it here I think that would my view would change So there's a spoiler alert With a back catalogue of that match Of the day Top 10 series But the rest of them are available Am I on commission if I give that a mention? You're doing well, thank you BBC sounds for all of that 30 seconds remain of normal time Argentina 3, Croatian 0 We'll find out how much stop It's time they will be very very soon Messi Little dart forward Tries to grab the ball back Palacios was ahead of him Mayer now will bring it clear for Croatia There's going to be 5 minutes of additional time And we're into those 5 minutes now Where are you on the debate Rob Green? Well I didn't want 5 minutes injury time I don't think the Croatians did either So I'm not sure what they want to debate about it Messi's fifth Final World Cup And he will end it In the final Morocco France tomorrow night The builder from 6th with Marc Chapman Will determine Who his opponents will be Morocco Making history at this World Cup The first African side to reach the last four The Argentinian supporters Have been celebrating For a long time now With the balloons, the flags and the scarves Are only thinking now And dreaming of what Sunday might provide As Martinez comes a long way He's handling tonight Rob Has been exceptional Really confident Looks composed, looks assured The back line have looked assured Never been in doubt There's never been a wobble To go a full hour and a half of football And not have a one single Wobble Or question A game like that It's a really impressive performance It also says something about Croatia And how they struggled tonight We have third clean sheets In six appearances at the World Cup They're ready to celebrate On the bench down below In fact, DePaul has been replaced He's actually joining in I can see his right arm being punched In the air and they're bouncing up and down It's hard to differentiate Where the supporters are And the players, because the supporters And the players are joining In with the same celebration Great to see So we should enjoy it as well Pure relation Pure enjoyment So much joy inside This stadium from the Argentinian players and the supporters There's a cross from the left And even now they want to keep that clean sheet As Talya Fico Heads the ball behind for a corner kick The only area that is motionless The only area that is silent Is the red and white section Low down in the bottom tier Towards our right hand side Croatia have always scored at least one In ten knockout matches At the World Cup Looking for a consolation As the cross comes in they won't get it like that Poor delivery It's actually getting louder You just think If you are a Croatia fan You stand in there and you beat them You're disappointed but you're here Last itch Trying to turn And it just comes straight off his left boot And out for a goal kick In about two minutes time He probably won't hear the whistle Of the Italian referee Daniel Osato But you will hear The celebrations Of the bench And 50,000 Argentinian fans Inside this stadium What an incredible job the coach Has done so long he hasn't he After leading them to success Against Brazil And then There was no panic At the start of this tournament The result went against him No panic whatsoever Stayed calm, come back Get the next result and move on And they look very impressive tonight And the decisions that he's made Also in terms of selection And systems, they've worked The way he's handled Those two up front And getting the best out of those two up front And Alvarez and Messi Being magnificent And very little coaching experience Either at club or international level But over the last four years He's changed the fortunes They won that Copa America as we were saying And here they're going into this World Cup final now Maybe even looking for a fourth goal As Palacios plays the ball forward To Juan Foyth, they're headed him on that far side There are about 30 seconds remaining Foyth High of the pitch On the right turns back And there is going to be One hell of a party Here in Lucille very very soon Because we have 20 seconds remaining And Argentina Who haven't won the World Cup For 36 years Are heading towards Their sixth World Cup final The last 10 seconds remain Vaughn is played back Loughran's going to let one fly from long range He's over the crossbar And look at the whistle And there is the final whistle And the players run onto the pitch From the substitute bench And the Argentinian players Out on the field Embrace each other And 50,000 Argentinian supporters Inside the LaSale stadium Celebrates with their arms aloft The balloons, the scarves The flags are flying Because Lino Messi An icon And Sal in inspiration here tonight Knows that he's one step away From the trophy that he craves They've beaten Croatia By three goals to nil They deserve it They look really impressive Their best performance from the tournament From start to finish They look so comfortable They look strong all over the pitch And with those two up front You've always got a chance with your running ability With the energy that Alvarez has And then with the ability that Messi has They will fancy their chances on somebody here again They were composed at the back They were clever up front They were creative They were clinical They earned this Won it, hands down No word of a lie Kelly Rob's just to my right I was straight to hearing him talk then Argentina are through Two goals from Alvarez after the Messi penalty Argentina three Croatia nil And it is difficult to hear and to be heard Over the noise inside the La Sale stadium As Argentina go into the World Cup final With that three nil victory And the Argentina fans As we've been saying all tournament As I'm sure you're probably sick of hearing Have been absolutely fantastic All the way through And they're going to continue for the next Half an hour at least because the players Haven't even made their way over to the supporters yet The Argentina players then Out on the middle of the pitch They are commiserating with the Croatia fans With the Croatia players The Croatia fans are commiserating with their players But Alan in terms of the game itself It was such a fantastic complete performance As you said It feels like they've grown into this tournament And maybe have that final gear to go through You can imagine the pressure they were under After the first game in this tournament So for them to come back And the way they have and get gradually Slowly get better and better And we knew that at some stage You might have to win it via penalty shootout They did that in their last game But this from start to finish was more impressive They looked strong at the back They looked hungry in midfield And with the energy and ability And pace and skill that they've got up front It was only ever going to be one result in this game I think you're looking at a team That have found their way through the tournament Found different systems Different ways to get the victory Whether it be by hook or by brook But today they had a plan Scalloning the manager of the coach Set them up And they implemented it perfectly And it's a big factor towards the final That they've been able to cruise through this game They're celebrating now But this was never in doubt And they've been able to do it And I'm watching the Argentina players Down there in a line All with their arms around each other Singing with their supporters Who are over behind the goal to our left We saw towards the end of the game As the supporters cranked up the volume In celebration Players, the back room staff on the bench Were all standing up They were all singing along with them The song itself is about Diego Maradona Looking down from the sky Looking down from the sky And cheering on Lionel Messi and the rest of the team About the history that Argentina have In this competition About beating Brazil, about that turning point That Tim Vickery was telling us earlier Of the victory at the Maracana You played, when you played for Newcastle You played for a club where you have That emotional connection That can bring with it Pressure as well as the The joy of being able to deliver What I've seen in the faces Of the Argentina players on the pitch today Looks almost like relief That there's maybe that the shackles are off now Yeah, you can imagine Or try and imagine the pressure that These players are under The number of fans that have actually travelled here To follow their team To follow their country And then after that first game They couldn't do anything wrong after that They were out of the competition So the way they've handled that Has been really, really impressive And they demand success They want success and They're driving this team on These fans, wherever you go here In Doha They're everywhere and They've been so well supported Of their team Their team are giving it back to them And certainly on tonight's evidence that They're going to have a right good go on Sunday No matter who they play And they've shown Rob as we were saying That they've been able to grow throughout this tournament The tactical changes made by Scoloni Ahead of the game During the game of Work for Argentina Has led them to this 3-0 win When you look at What lies ahead of them Whether it's going to be Morocco or France It's going to be two very different challenges That they potentially could face In the World Cup final Does it feel as though Argentina have what it takes To play either of those sides Absolutely, and you look at the way they played And I think what's key is To know their roles The players who are the workers The ones who've got to dig in They've got to fight and scrap They do that so well And then they just have the luxury Of a certain individual who They're saying, even if it doesn't go to plan Let's stay in the game and he will do something magical And he did that tonight So they've got the game plan They can implement it in different ways It will be interesting I think if it's against France They can play to get them tested In a different way But there's a certain matter Tomorrow night to decide that before we go there Deno, just watching the players On the pitch It feels like every time they go to move off They get sucked back in again They keep going to leave the pitch and then go Now we're going to stay here with the fans Wherever you look around the stadium The Argentinian fans celebrating But the name bulk of them Is in that end away towards Our left-hand side And they've just formed a semi-circle The Argentinian players and they've linked arms And they are the ones jumping up And down and bouncing And you know before you talked about pressure With Robin Allen They're embracing this And the players, as we've seen right at the end Those on the bench Were preparing to celebrate and it was hard To distinguish where the line between The supporters down below us Ended and then it started with the bench Such is the joy And they're all as one Both the supporters and the players alike And the coaching staff as well And you're quite right, these testers' supporters They're not moving anywhere They will be singing and partying long Hard into the night I think often, Alan When we talk about Lionel Messi People that divided into two camps Those that love him and want to hear everything About him and those that think That the whole Messi thing is a bit overblown When you talk about anyone else Do you think on the evidence of tonight's game You can explain why We talk about Messi so much Well, just look at the third goal Look at the way We were speaking in glowing terms About Guardiola as a defender Before the game And rightly so Because it's had a really good tournament But the way Messi sort of went past him And then stopped and then went past him again Because he couldn't out-strengthen He couldn't show all that power that he's shown In the rest of the tournament Because he knew he'd fallen and bring him down But the way Messi just glided past him And then had the ability to look up And then put it on a plate For Alvarez right in front of the goal For the goal that he actually deserved Was just absolutely staggering And yes, that is why we talk about him such a lot Because not many, if any, can actually do that He's played a different game at times He does that and there'll be moments where He looks disinterested, he's wandering He's... Then he does that and you just Wow, wow, you just Have to applaud it and There is some players you come up against Where you realise you're getting a situation And there's, as Guardiola found out there There's nothing you can do to stop him And he could have done anything That he could have tried Once he got there, once he got in that moment He wasn't stopping him The manager, the coach, has found The ideal partner for him In terms of someone who can do A lot of his running And when he can walk around He doesn't have to press on every occasion But in Alvarez he's got someone Who's prepared to do that for him He's here yet, no problem But on the other hand, the way he sort of sets him up then As a strike point, you don't mind Doing that little bit of extra work And as I said in commentary, I don't often Praise or want to shout out Or want to shout out someone who works So hard because I think that should come from Every single footballer But this guy takes it to another level And it's not just his work where it's His ability to put The opponent under pressure but then when he gets The ball, as we saw in the first half With the ability to run with it and get him behind On the two occasions he did He got the penalty and he got the other goal So it was, the manager's Found a way to get the best Out of Messi in there and also Alvarez Is it suit on this team and they're looking Really impressive and they're having Great fun down on that pitch They don't want to go in the dressing room You know when As a teenage kid and the lads Were just For the circle and one lad Had started getting pushed and jostled in the middle And then you take it in turns That's what the Argentinian players are doing now It's like they're in a teenage school disco And what kind of discos you went to, Denner That's not how you Ask a young lady to dance Charlie on social media said This guy is effectively playing with one leg And he just twisted the stand out of defender Of the World Cup inside out and he's 35 years old Whether he wins the trophy or not, he is the greatest There's no argument Shay said, there are people who want to Baker's believe that Messi needs a World Cup title To prove he's the best, he's so superior It's not even funny, Rich said He wasn't really a debate before this World Cup But Lionel Messi is by far The greatest player in living memory It's a difficult argument To have when you're comparing players Of different eras But of the players in this era Is there any debate in your mind About Messi, is there A genuine contender No, I mean He's taking performances Goal scoring levels And He very rarely seems to miss a game And he seems to be fit The vast majority of the time And I said before The ball was kicked tonight It's one thing getting to the very Very top of the tree It's another one actually staying there So staying there year after year after year And for your club And for your country when Everyone is looking at you As the stand out performer Everyone is looking at you to put the ball in the back Of the net when your country Looking at you to make the changes For you to have that belief And give them belief that They've got a chance in this competition And that's why they're in the final It's because Of him and because everyone looks to him I mean Yes, he doesn't work as hard As he once did He might not be as quick as he once was years ago But he's still got that magic He's still got that ability To twist and turn Run with the ball and go past defenders With ease and he can make The very very best look Ridiculously average at times Which of course they're not If you asked him Do you want to be the best in the world Or do you want that medal Give me that medal Because one takes care of the other And I think that's the answer I think he would snap your hand off For a World Cup winners medal Now for someone who's done Much for football Tim Vickery, our South American football expert Is listening at half time Tim, when Argentina were 2-0 up You talked about the fact that maybe Argentina are seeing A glimpse of the future without Lionel Messi that maybe this looks Like it can be a succession Rather than an ending Did that third goal sum that up? No, the first goal summed it up The one where it's Enzo Fernandes beating the defence And then the second goal to Alvarez Just a point on this party When you go these days to League games in Argentina The quality's gone down Because all the players get sold And you come out just remembering the songs On the atmosphere it's just incredible The songs, they just get in your brain When you get something like this With the national team and you have The party and all of the quality On the field, where else Would you want to be What it's all about, isn't it? One of my favourite quotes about football Comes from Cesar Luis Minotti Who was their coach When they won the World Cup for the first time in 78 He said, a footballer is important Because he or she Lives out the dreams Of many many people And you can see that in this Argentina team, can't you? They are one force together with their supporters On the field They are living out the dreams Of those supporters in the stadium And all those watching on TV back at home It's an extraordinary religious communion It's a very very powerful thing Like Scoloni the coach Is in tears just just just watching this Just drinking in all of this emotion But yeah to your original question The first goal, the one that opens it up It's Enzo Fernandez Who was the one who was driving them forward When Croatia seemed comfortable at 0-0 To Julian Alvarez, I said before the game Alvarez has come here Because they've realised that Messi Has to be sporadic And he needs more mobility alongside him And that's worked like an absolute dream And they were club mates They came up together at River Plate This is Argentine football It's an export industry One gets sold to City The other gets sold to Benfica You put them together again There's a little partnership Good teams are made of little partnerships Yes it all revolves around Messi But there is something else as well And there's something that's going to be there for years After Messi has gone I think I misunderstood your point there Because what I was talking about in the third goal Was almost that handing of the bat On the fact that Messi was there But there was a generosity in it He didn't have to do everything himself It was as the guys were saying In commentary almost as if he was saying to Alvarez You put in so much work Here's a tapping for you I'll do that bit I'll take the goal That's such a big part of Argentine football culture Requelmi The art of laying on a goal Is almost better Than scoring it That art of taking out the defence And just laying it on a plate for someone And saying go on, there it is I'll put it for you, bang it in That's really important in the culture Of Argentine football But what really stood out for me In that third goal In a little space of time Messi defines the concept of speed In football He's not the quickest anymore He's 35 Football speed is not Usain Bolt speed It's changes in rhythm He runs and he stops And then he goes again And then he comes in and then he goes out All these little changes of direction At pace while controlling the ball While knowing what everything that's going on Around him My career was being in at the start You know, seeing this Before you lot got a chance to see it Started 2005 in the South American Under twenties There was word about Argentina pick the 17 year old They didn't know much about them You played one friendly for Barcelona by new Spain wanted him So let's get him and see if he's any good He looked at him and then he always thought He's look at him, floppy little French You know he's half as high as anyone else the ball and the ball is tied to the foot and I think in Maradona said about Messi that he can he can dribble while watching TV and change the channels but while he's playing no one wants to change the channels everyone wants to watch the spectacle that he provides. There was a magical moment when he did do that bit of skill to cut back for Alvarez and he knew what he'd done was brilliant and he drifted off the pitch after cutting it back and was already celebrating and he stood there taking the adoration of the fans because he was going thank you I know what I did was brilliant and as Tim says that the tapping in was the tapping in the art the everything was in what he did there and he knew it. Alan regarding Sunday's final now do you think Argentina who do you think they'll prefer to play out of Morocco France obviously you've got Messi and Bapé which would be the head-to-head to try and sell it not a World Cup final need selling of course probably Morocco and although they'll be tough to beat they won't like us seeing that I suppose but they'll be up against it I think with the with the ability that France have in forward positions but this Argentina team particularly with those two up front and they're understanding and in relationship they actually they find a way and they found a way tonight they were they had to be patient for around about half an hour because there wasn't a lot happening Messi hardly had a kick and Croatia defending really really well against him and it looks as if he was just walking and drifting and susing just susing the game out saying okay where am I going to find those little pockets of space and then all of a sudden that changed the ball through for alvarez and then from that moment on they were never in any any danger so with those two up front they'll they'll they'll find a way to score goal or two it was 20 minutes wasn't it 20 minutes he just drifted out to this right hand south that space went right now I'm in the game and then he was away and then the game changed but the question people may think all a strange question to ask the only reason to ask it is that they struggled against Saudi Arabia with the energy levels that Saudi Arabia in the opening game that mocha that Morocco might be able to replicate yeah I get that I understand that but I think that this is a different argentina team in terms of mentally physically where they were to then to where they are now and the confidence that they would have had not from this performance but other performances to get here penalty shootout showed character um after being tuned up and then and then losing that lead so where they are mentally now I think there's a different place to where they were at the beginning of the competition I know they came into it 36 games unbeaten I think um but this is this is a this is a different team mentally now and they understand where they are and and what system they're they're playing all again the manager changed it again tonight from three at the back to four at the back of course when they go to tune the lucky then puts another defender on to try and show things up which that did so confidence wise it's a very very different team I think as well you're looking at what was essentially a cruise for Croatia to get against Croatia to get to the final they've got an extra day whoever gets to the final between Morocco or France it's going to be a scrap it's going to be a battle they're going to have to put everything on the line they've got a day less to recover it lends itself to Argentina and their preparation Alan just a quick one on on Argentina and fitness of key players in terms of the final Lino Messi looked like he was clutching his hamstring or holding onto his hamstring a little bit during that do you think he should have played the the full match well the Scoloni the coach did actually look over to him when there were three in a lupin making all those changes and he did he did say to him I saw him um he did say do you do you want to come off or what do you what do you want and messy I wasn't sure at the time but he obviously said no way I don't want to come off so if there was anything wrong with him or his hamstring whatever he'd have been off so there was nothing wrong with his hamstring the way he went past Guardiola in that box not once but twice there was no injury there Tim as much as Argentina learned as as Denner was saying there from the defeat by Saudi Arabia right at the start of this tournament the way that they've developed through it do you think that going into the final on Sunday regardless of who it's against they'll have learned something from that defeat eight years ago in 2014 try and take out umba pay before he gets on the field but is there a sense of like I know there's I know there aren't that many players left in there in the squad who'll have that that experience but is there a is there something that they can learn is that something that will be in their minds and the reason one of the reasons I ask it is because of the the song that we keep talking about and the fact that the fans have sensed this this sea change yeah I went one of the lyrics in this song that they're just singing over and over again they talk about all the finals that they lost and all the years that I cried you know there's a full on embrace of of the suffering of of being a football fan and of being an argentina fan when they had to wait so long uh let's not get ahead of ourselves but just one interesting little thing when Scoloni took over remember in the last World Cup his role had been observing argentina's opponents one of whom of course were france and when he took over he was only a caretaker but he he was talking the talk and he was saying you know what look at france they win the ball within five seconds they're in a position to shoot that's the style that we need that's the style i'm going to implement it lasted one competitive game it was obviously not a style that fitted messy anyway you know and uh so that the first game that they played under Scoloni as a it was the the cop america of 19 of 2019 uh columbia picked them off they're all over the place they're all spaced out over the field and columbia picked them off and after that defeat they got together and thought you know this isn't this isn't going to work we need a rethink and they began to edge towards something better something functional something that works for the players that they had more in the midfield and something similar has happened in this World Cup because they lose the first game i take the point about moroccan energy levels if they get through and if they've got anything left but morocco ain't going to do what Saudi Arabia did to them which was remarkable wasn't it a morocco is zero risk Saudi risked everything on that high line trying to disrupt the rhythm high win the ball high and then put argentina under pressure the moroccan approach would be would be radically radically different but just like in 2019 first defeat first contact with reality as the old phrase goes you know a plan never survives contact with the enemy and then they've had to think their way through the tournament and as as allen was saying pretty much everything scolonia is doing is is coming right can i just ask allen about the the penalty shootout um against holland because i thought what lao taro martinez did was one of the all-time great penalties now he starts that the tournament as the center forward against Saudis he scores two very good goals one on one with a keeper they're ruled out for narrow v a r argentina lose as a collective crisis he loses his place in the side for huli and alvarez they bring him on against poland they bring him on uh uh they bring him on against australia he can't buy a goal the the goal just looks tiny in his heart it's it's a complete public loss of confidence and he steps up to take the fifth penalty at a point where argentina look as if the thing's been snatched away from them yet again they were two nil up there were two penalties up holland scored three in a row enzo finandez misses the penalty before that's a real pressure penalty and lao taro martinez steps up to take it if he misses he's the villain of villains and hollanda right back into it i thought i don't think i've ever seen a bit of pressure penalty taken better did you admire that allen oh absolutely i think we said it at the time oh my goodness he's missed so many chances it hasn't quite gone for him fallen for him in this world cup so then to have the pressure of having to score that that that penalty i mean we talk about the pressure that's on that's on messy because of who and what he is but him walking up to to score that penalty yeah yeah you're absolutely right and we talk about it being in a pressurized situation you'd never thought that the way he yeah he stuck it away so i was really pleased for him because i wouldn't want anyone to have missed that one and he doesn't get on the pitch today doesn't get on the pitch today and i'm sure he wanted to get on the pitch today but i'm sure he won't be moaning and complaining and that's part of the experience he can't know because of the the form that that messi and alvarez are in and as you and we've said during the night he's he's found a way to get there yeah the best and what works best for this team and what's working best at the minute is those two because they look pretty unstoppable at the minute you talked about the pressure allen on on leon on messy that's been the question about him all the way through this tournament and beforehand is how will he cope with it he said after the game all the way experiences crazy we said it at the beginning trust them because we know what we are argentina are back in a final and you have to enjoy it they don't look now the way they did at the start of this tournament which was a team under pressure messy himself look what he's celebrated his first goal in the tournament was a release now at the end of this game they look like they're ready to enjoy it they actually look they look as if they're having fun and and that's the way it should do which i suppose is really really difficult because of what they're under and the stakes that they're actually playing for and to to where these players will be elevated to not that messy needs that to be elevated any further than what he is but we know what the world cup means to that country you know what the world cup means to him so yeah but you wouldn't have thought that not in this performance anyway they looked as if they were enjoying it a look as if they were having fun and it looked as if to see you know what bring it on there's a brilliant saying about about the weight of the shirt for your country any whether it weighs heavy or whether it makes you light and fly these guys it looked light as a feather they were flying tonight allen thanks very much for your company this evening i've had a great night thank you do you enjoy it i loved it thank you thought you might have done thank you very much to allen shearer on argentina's three nil victory against creuatio we saw the best certainly in this phase of his career of leon al messy but two goals in that one for huli and alvarez as well i mean that it's looking fantastic in terms of argentina's futures tim vickery's been telling us it looks as though we've seen what the future might look like closely on a messy but will his final match in a world cup will his final match in an argentina shirt be in a world cup final and will that be the moment he's able to lift that world cup trophy and join diego maradona as a world cup winning captain for argentina that's what he's going to be aiming for and it could be either marocco or france denna when we we talk about the the argentina supporters and they're still here the hardcore fans are still here thousands of them behind the goal all the way to our left if we're looking for an atmosphere here at this world cup which has been a strange cup in terms of a strange world cup in terms of fans traveling in terms of who's here but argentina against marocco purely on that level purely on noise because when we look over at the other side of the the ground opposite to us lots of corporate seats and they're empty at various stages throughout the match if this is argentina marocco i don't think that's going to be the case if that was the case then i don't think there'd be enough tickets i mean what was it tonight 88 966 i've not seen marocco live yet at this world cup but i've heard their supporters and the way that they whistle just deafening and obviously they've traveled in great numbers i've seen a lot of them out in in doha and then you think 50 000 argentinians as well it's going to be a hell of a din but i would be worried if you'd actually get a spare ticket for that for the because of the sheer size of numbers for both argentina marocco well i hope that'll be all right but no from an atmospheric point of view you're right it would it would be something uh when tim was talking earlier about umbap the one player that the teams have struggled to contain actually is not umbap polem did a good job with matty cash by and large uh he scored the goals towards the end when polem were chasing it just don't show him in on his on his right foot car walk raffle did a good job the one player they've got to worry about is greezman in the center of midfield so that will be that'll be a fascinating contest here you know it was billed obviously about moderates and and and messing but greezman in this this new midfield role has excelled for france so um it whoever whoever goes through i think were guaranteed a great noise because even if it's the french they were quite vocal the other night against england in the albat but they'll struggle to silence these supporters because they're incredible tim obviously that's that's an energy that the players are harnessing on the pitch but it all comes down as we've talked about you know to the the tactics of scoloni the way he set up the team for this match the changes that he made during during this match do you think argentina have anything to fear even if it is from from france oh i think they've got plenty to fear from france uh and imbap paid just tore them to pieces four years ago uh that they couldn't catch him um the defensive unit you always think it can crack it's possible that that it can crack uh and that they were they were wobbling against holland and the big question that's left hanging out about holland is why didn't holland try and try and do what they done in the last 15 20 minutes of normal time why didn't they do it do that in extra time why did they just hand the initiative to to to argentina uh no there's so much in that french side to worry about you keep imbap paid quiet that opens up space for for greezman for for dembele on the other flank for for gero for the midfielders coming through uh i think france would be uh up a level on anything that argentina have faced so far in this tournament and talking of felipis galoni ian denis yeah it's just been uh it's just been out here as you say lianosca felipi is his brother i think he's friends calling felipi but he's just been out in front of the uh the argentina supporters and just taking it in just on his own and one of his coaches actually just watched him in his navy polo shirt and his tracksuit bottoms and he turned to that bank of support clenched fist celebration turned then to the pocket i think i wouldn't be surprised this is where a lot of the families are actually a lot of the families of the players are waiting and again he acknowledged their support and then there was just a hug from one of his coaching staff just his own solitary moment with thousands of his adoring supporters i've actually been watching the fans from around the stadium all moving towards the the throng of fans behind the goal so it's actually grown since the end of the game so it's getting bigger and bigger as people are making their way around it's just one big party i've done that before when i've come to watch argentina this world cup which has taken the long way out so you can walk out through the argentina fans because it's just fantastic and when you're here you want to be part of it
