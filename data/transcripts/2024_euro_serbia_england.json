  "transcript": " Saudi champions, Milinkovic Sadec also plays with him in that team. So the referee, Daniella R Sato, this is his last tournament before he retires from refereeing. He's got the ball at his feet and he's just arranging everyone for the start of England's campaign at Euro 2024. Matt Upsson is beside me, is he, Chris Stinson will hear from her regularly. She's down behind the goal, behind Jordan Pickford's goal in the first half. But Matt, up here in the commentary box, how are you feeling? Well, I'm still coming down from that England national anthem rendition, to be honest. I thought it was fantastic around the stadium, really big moment. The players soaked it all up, we're really passionate, we've got involved and the anticipation is really bubbling inside this stadium. And England are already out in position, Serbia huddled together, but you can tell we really want to get on with it here. Well, England were close three years ago, runners up at the last Euros, there were a penalty shootout away, but now the feeling is that this is their most informed squad. That's how Harry Kane described it to me, that Gareth Southgate has taken to a tournament. Gareth Southgate's fourth tournament as manager. And it's going to be Bukaj Osaka, the man who missed the deciding penalty, who kicks off for England. I think that's a great move for England. A little nod to what happened in the past and how things might be different. He played it all the way back to Pickford, who then strikes it long in left-footed downfield into the Serbia right back area. It's deflected. And then here is John Stones, who's under a little bit of difficulty against Blaovic. And then Stones into the challenge again, and Rice is able to come across and trip here as well, back to Gey on the edge of the box. They could have a little bit of an English Premier League feel this game. You can tell from the start a little bit long. Every ball that comes forward just there, Mitrovic challenging with Gere. He got no intention of winning the ball, but just wants to bounce him, stop the centre-back from clearing it, and John Stones having to drop and clean up behind. And I think as a partnership, they're going to have to be really aware of that this evening. They're going to relieve a lot of pressure at Serbia by going long, and Mitrovic is going to make himself a real nuisance. England in the almost all-white kit, playing from right to left as we look. And here's Jude Bellingham into the action for the first time on the left-hand side. Jude Bellingham, who missed the two warm-up matches after all of the Real Madrid exertions. Now Pukaj Osaka on the right-hand side, on his left foot, takes it back out to the far side. Kyle Walker is there, Premier League-winning captain this past season. So Walker and Stones together again on the right-hand side of the England defence. Phil Forden, number 11 on his back. Forden actually in quite a central position. Just currently Harry Kane's come out to the left-hand side, but England have got the ball in the central third of the field, Rice. And now here's Forden, trying to find the space to sack out Forden. Still on the right flank, really. Trent Alexander-Arnold in this midfield position. Oh, lovely, a lovely little flick and a trick from him. I thought Forden might have been fouled by Gudal there, but England have still got possession. Stones just pides his time, gives it the game. Again, out of trivia, the out of position, left back, the cut in field. And it's cleared away downfield by Belgevich for England to take up possession again, just inside their own half-match. Yes, interesting, isn't it? Very central, Phil Forden at the moment and Bellingham. It's almost like a licence to kind of drift into areas where he feels he can get on the ball and do some damage, which when you've got that kind of talent, you probably are best off leaving a little bit of freedom of movement to pick up those positions. I think that's the intention, Matt. And Forden is still there now in a very central position, as Sacher is tripped on the far side, and that's a pretty kick to England, halfway inside the Serbia half. Serbia, who are the world-ranked number 33 team. So in this group, we know that Slovenia and Denmark drew 1-1 earlier. Denmark, 21st in the world, Slovenia, 57th. But England, 4th in the world rankings. These Euros only, Hansen Belgium, are higher placed. And they've got an early chance for a set piece here after Sacher won the foul. And it's that man over, isn't it? Trent Alexander-Arnold, what kind of delivery can he put in here with his right foot? Left arm raised, right footed into the area, it's headed away, comes out the trippier on the edge of the box. He stabs it wide to the left, to Declan Rice. Declan Rice now just looks and then plays it back centrally to the centre circle. In all three of Garas Southgate's tournaments so far as manager, England have won their opening matches. Do you remember in Russia, it was a win against Tunisia, a late win. And then at the Euros last time, it was Croatia who were beaten by one goal to Nile. And then in the World Cup, that Hansen 6-2 win against Iran. Nile Nile in the very early stages. Five live from the BBC and Declan Rice in the centre circle, turns with his right foot, finds Alexander-Arnold, who's over towards the right flank. And the Liverpool man just knocks it in field where Declan Rice can now just pull the ball across to the left-hand side to Gage. Trippier, England are absolutely dominating the possession in the early stages of this match, attacking towards the end where those two tiers of Serbia fans, mainly in red shirts, are watching down. Folder, back to Jude Bellingham. Bellingham drops to 21 later this month, Jude Bellingham. But this is already his third major tournament after he made his debut on the big stage at the Euros three years ago. Kyle Walker now again, still the ball spending all of the time in the central third of the field in England possession. As John Stone strides forward with it. Now here is Bellingham, Bellingham approaching the penalty area into Fordham who took the ball on his instep, turned, and it just got away from him. And Serbia walloped out of the way downfield. A lovely pass, Jude Bellingham turned on it. Phil Folder now slaps his hands in the air knowing that he's got the quality to take that ball on the turn. Walker goes for a long pass, Trippier heads it back, first time shot on the edge of the box. There was a bit of a snapshot really by Fordham on the edge of the area and actually the assistant's flag was a judge to be offside. Yeah, it was a little bit frustrated. It popped back to him and I don't think he was quite set for that effort. But moments ago the pass from Bellingham, I mean, it really wasn't on. He just really tried his hand and forced it and that's what England have to do this evening. Serbia are going to sit so deep, they're going to try and get a bank of five and then a bank of three or four in front and really block England out. You've got to try and find those balls. You can only do it by being aggressive with your passing and Jude Bellingham certainly was there with that one. Matt Ubson went to the World Cup with England. I'm sure it brought back memories watching England in the tunnel for you. Yep, absolutely, that feeling. Trying to be calm. Yeah, it must be the most nervous that you feel, surely. As Serbia, this is their first attack. The ball pulled in at the top of Lavač, who's jumping for it. Couldn't get there. Tribje wasn't able to clear away. So Serbia now have it on this right-hand side with Lukic and they go back towards the halfway line. So yeah, the other match in this group, Slovenia won Denmark won. So generally, if the other teams in your group draw, most teams would consider that to be a good thing. So Serbia with the ball on the edge of their own penalty area. Now, we do have a choice of listening, by the way, for you tonight. A really big night of sport because the US Open is coming to its climax. So that is the choice of listening. The Golf is on Sport Extra. Ian Carter is live in North Carolina and Rory McElroy, last a look, was two shots off the lead held by Bryson de Chambord. So Sport Extra for that on your digital radio. Via BBC Sound. Kyle Walker has it on the right-hand side. He has Alexander Arndle. Alexander Arndle lifts it right footed high out towards the left-hand side. Tribje knocks it back to the halfway line. Kieran Tribje, it's his 49th cap tonight for the Newcastle United now. Back to Mark Gay on the halfway line, winning his 12th cap. Cross it goes to John Storms. Started every match for Garith Southgate, that his tournament as a manager. Walker, then a pace and pass through to Jude Valinger. Now Saka's there on the right-hand side. Back to the halfway line, it goes. Serbia just content to sit and say to England, come on, how are you going to find a way through us? It's a sharp start by us with the ball though, I have to say, even though I had loads of possession, not massively penetrating, we're moving it about with a bit of purpose. Some nice crisp fast passes through the midfield area. Bukajosaka took on Kostić there. The ball deflected out of play and it was given as a throw-in to Serbia, which Bukajosaka certainly disputed, but it is a throw-in to Serbia. Dragan Stojkovic is Serbia, finished bottom of their group with just one point at the World Cup in Qatar. It's the first time Serbia have played at the Euros as just Serbia. I remember actually watching in this stadium, Serbia and Montenegro at the World Cup in 2006. Paul Joule was alongside me that day, I remember. Argentina won 6-0 and a young guy called Lionel Messi, I think it was, came on as a substitute as an 18-year-old and scored his first goal at a World Cup finals. Not sure what happened to him after that. Drizzled into obscurity. Obscurity, Bellingham wins a free kick, but Janiello Sarton says, you've taken it probably 10 yards away from where you should. Actually, no, he has allowed England to continue to play. Well, he's retiring, he can do that sort of thing. A little bit of grace. An England's attack down the right comes to nothing, that is cleared away by Pavlovic. Both kept in on the far side by Declan Rice. Actually, no, he didn't. It's a throw-in to Serbia, 10 yards inside their own half. So, eight minutes played. You and I have been talking, haven't we, Matt, about how important these first 15-20 minutes are? Yeah, they certainly are coming off the back of the last performance. I think to get that out of the system almost and to show what a top footballing team England are. And we started the game pretty well, to be honest. There's an energy and a purpose, and I feel quite assured, John, in terms of the body language, the players that's sharp, some nice passes going on through into Bellingham at the moment. That was a nice one from Guy, actually, through the middle to Bellingham, who had two Serbs either side of him, and they eased him all about, won the free kick. You've seen an awful lot of that, haven't we, in the latter half of the season, due to Bellingham winning free kicks. Yeah, definitely. It's the second pass that Guy has put into him as well. So, that's a nice little room through the midfield, into the feet of Jude Bellingham, and him keeping his composure when he's going to get fouled and fouled again, even in this game, I think keeping focus, keeping grounded is going to be important for Jude Bellingham. But, referee Osato got that right, he was having his shirt pulled by Lukic, the fuller man, free kick then tripped, he actually plays it square. So, central free kick to Walker, and Walker hits a high pass to the far side of the penalty area. Two men have gone down, and that's given us a free kick to Serbia, fouled by John Stones off the ball. Him and Mitrovic were just grappling in the corner of the box. John Stones steps into him. It does look like he's probably intentionally tried to block Mitrovic from going out to deal with the ball to Declan Rice, but Mitrovic goes down so easily. It's quite clever, actually, how he won that foul. Serbia nil, England nil. If you're in your car, if you're racing home, this match is on BBC One tonight. I think Guy Mowbray and Alan Shearer are in the commentary position, maybe two up behind us. But you can follow it across all the various platforms on the BBC, and you will need BBC Sounds for the Euros. If you haven't got it already, let me tell you, BBC Sounds will change your life. So, take my advice, and you can listen to Five Live and Sports Extra's coverage of all of the matches via BBC Sound. Rewind the live radio, listen back to the commentaries. And actually, for any BBC TV match, you can choose the Five Live commentary synced up with the pictures on the iPlayer or the BBC Sport website. Now, just look for Euros Extra. Listen on most smart speakers as well. They're absolutely everywhere. It's been great having it out here, having the German TV on, but then having the BBC Sounds commentary. Yep. Been enjoying that. Yep, we had that in the car. Here's Forden, Rice, England still dominating the possession. Rice, forced to give it back towards the halfway line. So, over 10 minutes played, and neither goalkeeper really has had anything to do. Rykovic in the Serbian goal, and Mallorca goalkeeper, or Jordan Pickford in the England goal. Jordan Pickford, who is tonight equaling Peter Shilton's record of 20 appearances by a goalkeeper at a World Cup or a European Championship. It's his 62nd cap, the England goalkeeper, the Everton player of the season. As England have it on the halfway line. Three times in a row, actually, Everton player of the season. Pickford himself pointed out the other day. He has Walker on the right-hand side, looking for the run of Saka. Good pass. Saka now with a chance to cross, and Balliom is there! With a header in the six-yard box. England take the lead. And it is that man who opens the door for England here in Gelsenkirchen. Jude Barragham, 20 years old. He's had the season of his life at Real Madrid. He punches the air now as he gets to his feet, with his teammates all around him. He's done it for Real Madrid. He's won the Champions League, and now he scores England's first goal here at Newell. In the 13th minute, Serbia nail England one. I just love everything about this goal. It has so much to it. It's not anything particularly clever at all. It's just really good play. Aggressive decision-making. Brilliant fall from Karl Walker inside the fallback to Pocayo Saka. He gets to the byline with his right foot, chops it back into the goal. It's got a bit of a wicked deflection the way it kicks up off the turf. But Jude Bellingham, how brave is he, by the way? He's aggressive. He wants to win this header. He gets there ahead of the covering, Serbia defender. And he just powers it into the back of the net. It's a brilliant header from Bellingham. Great move from England. Jude Bellingham makes the difference. And it's Serbia nail England one. And England, that's just the start that they wanted. Garis Selkir, I can tell you, is up off his seat, punching the air. And is he Christensen? Down behind the goal is very close to the England support. It's just behind you, is he, down there? Yeah, the England supporters, they've been loud. But when that ball at the back of the net, they have gone up another notch. The noise is electric. The fans right behind me here at the barrier, they started to climb onto the barrier. Their arms were in the air, just like Jordan Pickford. They turned around when the ball at the back of the net and spun his arms in the air. He came over to his water bottle and he had a real nice smile to the bench. There was a few other substitutes celebrating with him virtually. What a moment. So is he down behind the goal? Matt Upsons with me here. It is Serbia nail England one. And England able to produce the sort of decisive move, Matt, that any England fan will have wanted to see. Simplicity is class, John. And I think that move just speaks that, to be honest. It wasn't elaborate. It was a really good pass from Walker. Well timed run, trying to get in behind Serbia. We've become, in the last few games, a little bit too possession-based without much of that cutting. Everyone, enough of that cutting edge we've just seen there. Lovely early cross into the box. You've got a midfield player arriving right on cue in Bellingham and brilliant brave header just to get on the end of it. Super goal. Jude Bellingham with his 23 goals for Real Madrid this season. And now, last time he played for England, he scored that. Late equaliser in the friendly against Belgium in March. And here he is scoring the first goal of the tournament. And it feels like history's repeated itself, Matt. When you and I were sitting in the stadium in Qatar and he scored England's first goal at the World Cup, now he's scored England's first goal at the Euro. It was a header as well, wasn't it? It was. It was a header as well. So, I mean, what can't he do, John? Anything on that pitch, what he cannot do? I mean, he's scoring headers, he can run, he's great with the ball at his feet. He's a model underpants. He can do absolutely what he likes. Anything. And when that goal was scored, Serbia had completed 12 passes in the match to England's 144. It's actually not that surprising, isn't it? No, no, but you've got to do something with it. You can't be content just having the ball. And England weren't there. They made a decisive move, positive decision-making, trying to hurt Serbia, getting behind them and it paid off. It was the walker pass. Yeah, that was the key to it. Yeah, it was. And Saka was onto it and he has Bellingham, who just glances the ball forward. Harry Kane, who's been involved in the match actually, Harry Kane, and Jude Bellingham now. So, as I say, for the second time scores the first goal at a big tournament for England. He has Alexander Arnold and now Saka, who will get an assist for that, Vakaya Saka. He's also so important to England for Kaya Saka, but he's barely been mentioned in the build-up to this World Cup. He was folding on the left-hand side. Trivia. It's across with his right foot as well, John, wasn't it? It was. Think it across with his right. And Bellingham has fouled. And he looks down at Zivkovic, who fouled him. He put his hands on his hips, he towers over him, and he looked down on him. It's up to Ziv to say, what are you doing? Just a look to say, don't do that again, son. Don't do that again, son. So, England have got the early goal. And actually, in all four of Garra Southgate's tournaments now, England have taken the lead in the first half of their first match. And three wins out of three so far, and that's the early goal that they've won. I mean, you spoke to me yesterday, Garra Southgate, about the fact that Germany had made such a strong start. Spain had made a strong start just before I spoke to him, actually, yesterday. You know, England took note of that, and really wanted to try and do something similar. You feeling a bit more relaxed? I have to say, yes, good. Here is Velkovic on the halfway line, passes it up to Vlavic, but in comes the tackle there from Mark Gay, and now Foden has a chance to carry the ball in field. They're trying to catch him. He gives it to Alexander-Arnold, who shoots from the edge of the area, but miss-hit it, really. And it bounce well way to the target by four or five yards, just watching Jude Bellingham, who's still on the ground, just claiming to his feet now, and Daniele Orsato has run all the way across. And I think there's a suggestion there from Bellingham that he was caught by an arm of Vlavic. Yeah, from Vlavic. I mean, I think he does leave his forearm out there a little bit and catch his Bellingham in the side of the head. The contact isn't a particularly hefty blow, but he still clipped him. And I think Jude Bellingham just making that point to the referee. But that piece of pressure was started by Mark Gay. Being quite brave, going in deep, going all the way in with Vlavic, and just putting him under pressure to win the ball back. He started really brightly, Gay. He actually really confident start from him. So England lead through Jude Bellingham's fourth goal for England. It's his 30th cap here in Gelsenkirchen, where I can see the Sun is shining, glinting on the white metalwork of the roof of the arena, Alkšalka. That's a poor pass actually by John Stones for Wauke. And he couldn't keep it in play, and it's out of play for a throw into Serbia, halfway inside the England half. This stadium, I remember coming here shortly after it had opened, and it's got a big cube that hangs above the centre-circle with big screens on it. And so actually the match is being shown up there as well to all four sides of the stadium. Vlavic now is well challenged by Gay, but that's given away by Alexander-Arnold. He has Mitrovic shooting wide, Serbia's first chance. Tickford diving to his left. I'm not sure he would have got there, and it was well hit by Mitrovic, but wide by probably inches. Oh, got away with one there. Trent Alexander-Arnold doesn't get the ball under control. I mean, Mitrovic takes it so early. He just has a loose touch, Alexander-Arnold. It really bounces off his shin as he's chasing it. Ricochet's back to Mitrovic, and he takes it so early. Just blazes it wide. Yeah, it must have flashed. Just past you, is he, behind the goal there? Yeah, it was very, very close. He hit it with some serious, forced it, Alexander Mitrovic. But it's just come a little bit sloppy from England, and just watching Jordan Pickford's body language, he is so on it, he is so sharp. He absolutely hammered John Stones for passing the ball out a play a moment ago. And John Stones has actually just signalled to him, giving him the thumbs up to say, stay on my back, mate, because we need to be on it. They can't give Serbia a sniffy yet. Yep, yep. That's excellent. Excellent insight from down there, from Izzy. And Matt up here, we're watching Bukaj Osaka winning a free kick for England. And this is 30 yards out, right of centre. So Alexander-Arnold is there again as well. Foulding just to his right, Jordan standing with his hands on his hips. Alexander-Arnold just puts his left foot next to the ball and then takes two, three strides back. It is Trent Alexander-Arnold with the free kick. That bounces down and hits Rice. I think it might have been glanced by a defender into his midriff. And before he knew what had happened, the ball had bounced straight through and behind the far post for a goal kick. Yeah, I mean, I think one of the deckland feels he's going to get the ball. Not even sure there was a touch. He just took him completely by surprise, hits him in the shoulder. He's got no time to react, and the ball just rolls out of play for a goal kick. But, you know, that right foot of Alexander-Arnold, I mean, it was quite a narrow free kick, wasn't it? But he's able to wrap his foot around it and get that angle, almost create an angle, to put a really good delivery into the box for players to go and attack. Serbia nil, England 1-5 live, BBC sounds. Here's Trebjav, towers above Zivkovic. Great spring from him to head it forward. Trebjav playing as the left back. Lukasjord is on the bench for this match, incidentally. Vlavaj just crossfield passes, easily cut out by Kyle Walker, who has the ball on the edge of his box, plays it back to Pickford. Pickford pulls it under his left foot and then hits it long, high up towards the goal scorer, Jude Bellingham. I think he's got a shove in the back there from Valkovic. That's Serbia with Zivkovic will actually knock it back towards the edge of the penalty area, to the rugged figure of Nikola Milenkovic. And then back to Golgipa, Rijkovic, left footed from him up towards Mitrovic, Dusan Tadec on the bench. And Declan Reis is dispossessed. Now Vlavaj on the edge of the area, Vlavaj is shot, blocked by Gea. You've got his left leg in the way of that, bounced out to Saka. And Serbia have committed men downfield here. And that means there could be spaces, but Foden passed the ball behind Saka. So Serbia have got it back now, and it is Serbia who will come forward with Kostić. The Juventus left wing back as he is in this Serbian line-up. Dragan Stukovic has used back three, back four, but it is a three-central defenders today, and then Kostić concedes the throw. And Jude Bellingham has just had a little set to with Kostić. Bellingham actually just turned his back on him, walked away from him, and Kostić chased after him. I think he gets in his face a little bit just before that, whether or not he's just getting up to the crowd, he just drops a little shoulder into Kostić's chest. I can understand why he's had a little pop at him there, John. Bellingham really is on it. I mean, he's the one pressuring there. He shuts the ball down. He's pumped for this game, Jude Bellingham. Yeah, you can see that. And that could have happened in any era, couldn't it? It could. That little exchange between the two of them. It's great to see, John, if I'm honest. I mean, you want to see that kind of energy and passion in the game of this size. And I think England have started with that in their game. You can tell that the players are really wired into it. Garry Southgate will want them to press on from here, just like Spain and Germany did in their opening matches, though. And Serbia just showing a little more at the moment. They are 1-0 down. But it is in the forward areas where their talents are. But Glavic's Crossfield pass is cut out by Alexander-Arnold. Now Saka plays it for De Walker. Walker speeding into the area. Walker goes for goal, and it's all the way across the six-yard box. There were men in there, Kane, Foden and Alexander-Arnold, but none of them could get a touch to it, and it rolled right across the goal and away. Well, that is the steam train that Kyle Walker is when he gets on the overlap. There is no stopping this guy at any age. He makes it, but it's almost a cross-cum-shot. It's neither. He kind of originally sees the angle that he could have a shot at goal, then realises it's too tight, and then the cross isn't quite cut back enough for anyone to finish, and it rolls agonisingly in that gully of space where no-one is, and just wide. What a great opportunity to put a second in. Yes, it was. He scored in the qualifying campaign. Do you remember that one in Rotswaf? It's his only goal for England, which came in what was his 77th appearance. And here he is now, Walker. This is his 84th for England. And big opportunity, really. Massive. I mean, it was a brink. Whenever Serbia want to come out, they're in trouble. I think with that good when we win the ball back, finding that one or two passes off, and then we've got a runner, the space is there, and the pace we've got, it's going to kill them if they do expose themselves. They've got to really balance it correctly, Serbia. Otherwise England, I think, are really going to get out. 25 minutes played. Serbia nil, England won. At the US Open, Rory McElroy, two shots off the lead. So you can hear that right now on Sport Extra. But here on Five Live as will be the case over the course of the next month. It is the Euros, all the top summer sport. And the general election as well. Not to mention the T20, incidentally. And we now know that England's first match in the Super 8 will be in the early hours of Thursday morning against the West Indies in St Lucia. So Five Live the place, Sport Extra, the place to listen to that in the early hours of Thursday morning. One nil England lead, but the ball inside their own penalty area. Back to Jordan Pigford, all in green. Long and left-handed from him, Harry Kane is wrestling. Milenkovic says referee Osato. Kane feels that he was being fouled by the big number four, but the free kick's gone. Serbia as well. Yeah, I mean, he's a big lad as well, isn't he? Milenkovic, I think, six foot five. Harry Kane, who rather kind of unselfishly hasn't been heavily involved in this game. He's just been trying to occupy, I think, the back three. Certainly Milenkovic, the middle of the back three, the big six foot five centre back. He's just been occupying him and just trying to create that space for Bellingham, for Foden to get into in typical unselfish Harry Kane style. That's Matt Upsen. Is it Christensen's down behind the goal? It's Serbia nil England won. And Serbia have got the ball halfway inside their own half. So, one-one in the earlier match between Slovenia and Denmark. England's next match is on Thursday, and it's the middle match, so it'll be a five o'clock kickoff UK time against Denmark. He has rice near the halfway line, Trippie. And then Jude Bellingham commanding, really, the way that Bellingham just moves onto the ball there. And even though it's a simple thing, he just, with his right foot, unhearingly finds his target. He's got this kind of bouncing strut when he comes off of it. It's like such a confident little jog away from those moments, isn't it? And then he's, like, adjusting his position, head on the swivel, wanting to get on the ball again. I mean, he's... I've said before, Matt, it's got a little bit of Brian Robson about it, I feel. In terms of that kind of strut. It comes up exactly what you say. It's just that it oozes confidence, doesn't it? Yes, Alexander-Arnold. Lovely ball over the top to Saka. Saka has two men with him. Ball bounces for Saka inside the penalty area. Now on the edge of the box. Bellingham is there. Little touch back to Alexander-Arnold. Excellent change of feet. He easily beat Milenkovich, who came... Who came rattling in, Milenkovich. And Alexander-Arnold knew exactly what he was doing. It was Goodell, actually. Goodell, who went sliding in. And Alexander-Arnold, just too quick. Feet were too quick. Lovely, wasn't it? Shift from right foot to left. Just that little quick pop of the ball draws the foul, and this is an interesting distance, John. It certainly is. This is probably not quite 25 yards. It's right of centre. I've seen Harry Kane hit them from here before, but Alexander-Arnold and Trippier and Thornton are all together around the ball. Probably the wrong side for Trippier. But let's see what they've got in mind. They've got their set piece specialist England. They've had one for years. They were ahead of the curve with that, as Gareth Southgate was pulling me up on a few months ago. And referee Osato says, I think, he's saying the England... Oh, no, he's saying get the ball on the pitch. Any chance of getting the ball on the grass? Yeah, which Alexander-Arnold was holding the ball. So it is. It looks as though it's going to be Alexander-Arnold, but they're making Serbia a thing here. Trippier. And now they're fiddling about again. I think Saka's just lurking in that wide position, ready for a little slip to pass, you feel? I think Serbia, one eye on that, they're going to play it short. Well, it's had the big build-up, this one, no mistake. Trippier walks away. Alexander-Arnold is ready, but it could be Thornton. Alexander-Arnold, the wall just inside the Serbia box. Alexander-Arnold hits the wall, bounces out, only half-clear away, comes back to Alexander-Arnold, and then Trippier passes slightly behind him. So Trippier actually has to roll the ball all the way back to Pickford, and it comes to nothing. Very often it does when you see the big build-up. The big build-up, yeah. Unconvincing, wasn't it? I don't think in the end, I'm not sure if Trent Alexander-Arnold really quite knew what he was doing, but Jude Bellingham knows what he's doing. Doesn't he, Chas? With that, he just hit it across the window. A crossfield pass, which I think our microphones actually picked up the noise of that, didn't it? The foot. It was sort of splat as he hit it. Here's Saka on the right-hand side. Saka takes on his man to the byline. Right-footed cross, comes off the head of a defender, but that was enough of a deflection to take it beyond anyone in a white shirt. But back it comes for England again. Here's Bellingham once more. Bellingham 30 yards out, right-footed cross into the box. Saka gambled. It was headed away, though, by Pavlovic for Serbia. And Declan Rice now in possession of the ball. Alexander-Arnold, I mean, it's a very fluid England. Formation, this. I mean, Alexander-Arnold's now here on the left-hand side. And Alexander-Arnold, there in the alley, gave it away, actually, to Mitrovic. He was rather slow on that, I must say. Stones. Now Walker for Saka again on the right-hand side. Saka taking on Pavlovic, going down. And the referee says it was hand-balled, I think, by Saka in a tefri kick to Serbia with England 1-0. Yeah, they're struggling to get to grips with that Walker-Saka combination. The pass always seems to be on the angle from Walker inside the pitch. As I look at a slow motion of the Jude Bellingham right-foot sidewinder across the field. I mean, technically, just executes it so well. But on that far side for England, Walker and Saka really are working well together. Really good understanding. And Pavlovic at the left-side centre-back struggling to know what position to take up. Serbia-0, England 1. Five live BBC sounds. I hope you're going to be with us all the way through the Euros. Every match covered. And we've got three more commentaries for you tomorrow. Romania, Ukraine, Belgium, Slovakia as the group E matches get under way. They're the first two commentaries at two and five. And then tomorrow night, you and I will be in Düsseldorf, won't we? First in Austria against France. One of the leading contenders, Didier Deschamps, side. Serbia bringing the ball forward. With Pavlovic, who gets it back there near the halfway line. And then Pavlovic all the way across to Velkovic. And Velkovic here to Zivkovic on the right flank. Comes back centrally again for once England are out of possession inside their own half. And it's Serbia trying to craft something. Here is the now Saudi-Arabian-based Mitrovic to Zivkovic on the right-hand side. Left-footed ball into the penalty area. Roel Well had it away by Gay. And then England are able to get it further away through Saka and Forden. And Forden with a very nice touch actually, but not enough to reach Harry Kane. But an aerial threat there when we know that. We know the threat that Serbia are in the air. Yeah, when they put the ball in the box, not only do they deliver it, they have players that arrive in there. And I have to say, Mark Gehrheet, he's up there with my player of the match so far. His performance for England, he's been brilliant left side centre-back. His position has been great. He's gone in tight and put players under pressure. His winning balls in the air, he's passing it well. He's had a really solid opening half an hour for England. Serbia, who scored more headers, no goals from headers in the qualifiers than any other team. And Mark Gehrheet, who certainly is not the tallest, Serbia bringing the ball forward again from the halfway line. Lukic, under pressure, has to turn back and give it back to the left-hand side to Kostic, who angles it back, now near the left corner of the England penalty area. Saka jumps in, comes back to Kostic, his left foot of the ball across the box, but in position is Dutalingen, who swings the right foot at it and puts it out near the halfway line. Yeah, not the tallest by any means, Mark Gehrheet as a central defender. He's given us six foot tall, but I interviewed him the other day after the Iceland match. And producer Gary Flintoff took a photograph of us for the old social media. When I saw it, I thought, I'm absolutely cowering over Mark Gehrheet. That's most people. You just don't realise, because you're in that lofty space up there, and we're all just staring up at you. Yeah, but he certainly... Yeah. Anyway, well, he can jump. He certainly can, as he's just proved. And if you time it well, you can be six foot and be really dominant in the air. Yeah, remember Canavaro, of course, so I don't think was six foot tall. No, probably not, just under. Here is Serbia, carrying the ball to the halfway line. England are leading by one goal to nil. And then Gehrheet steps out, it was a heavy touch, and now Gehrheet's out of possession, but Declan Rice is in position. And as the attempted pass was made towards the edge of the England box, Declan Rice was in exactly the right place. It really sensed that. I'm not sure there's a better defensive midfield play that senses that kind of situation and reads it instinctively, as well as Declan Rice in this tournament. I think he's superb at it. One nil England, and celebrity photographer Gary Flimtoff points out that Canavaro was five foot nine. Wow, no, really. Here's Lukic. Lukic out to the left-hand side, and here's Kostich again, back in field. Sasa Lukic, with some sort of strapping around his right wrist, comes to the right-hand side. Zivkovich is there, and then Zivkovich back into his own half. Martin, as Manchester United, are you going to throw that one in? Yeah, that's right. Should we keep going or stop? We could do. Chris Perri. Yeah. Yeah, he was probably under six foot. Good header of the ball. He might have been six feet, maybe. Here is Serbia on the halfway line. It's chip caught by Mitrovic, Zivkovich taking on Gehi, and then Flavic is moving in field, Jude Bellingham just got a touch on that. Rice was there behind him as well. Bellingham and Rice together. Many people felt that it should have been Bellingham and Rice as the two central midfielders. Bellingham's pass, he was caught late there, but he's found the pass to Saka. Kane making grants through the middle. Oh, Saka beats his man brilliantly into the box. Law ball across behind Foden, and the ball rolls all the way out into the opposite full-back position. Wow, Bakaio Saka brimming with confidence. He knows he's got the beat in Pavlovic. One-on-one, just too quick for him. Lovely little step over, gets around the outside of him, and it's a shame that Foden just couldn't adjust his run. He's making that run from outside to into that near post, the back post area. The ball just a little bit behind him, couldn't adjust himself. So that was Dazzling from Saka. He's already set up one goal for England, and looked as though he might get another one there. So Serbia have had a better spell of possession. They've threatened a little more, but as you say... I feel like England almost want that, John. As long as we can cope with it and deal with those defensive situations, certainly in the air when the ball comes in the box, I think it's going to suit England that they do come out, and then we get those one-on-one situations wide with Foden and Saka and Bellingham into Harry Kane. Yeah, he took on the absolutely strict Pavlovic for pace. He has Lukic, Lukic 10 yards inside the England half to his left, and then Mitrovic curls the pass out towards the left-hand side. Kostic is there. Kostic is high. Cross into the penalty area, headed down and away by Reis. Comes out centrally for Serbia again. They're threatening more than they have at any stage in the match now. Velkovic to Zivkovic. Zivkovic takes on Trippie, gets the cross in, but Reis was there as well at the near post, and brings the ball away, and then Foden with a confident touch, back to Bellingham on the edge of his own bar, who turns his man brilliantly, and then is basic. He's just pulled back, but then they take the free kick quickly. Bellingham takes it on, he's caught there by Goodell. The two of them, the ball had just got away from Bellingham, and Goodell came in, and the two of them collided, and the yellow card is out for Goodell. Just got a little bit overconfident there at two Bellingham. He rode the foul, and maybe could have just soaked up the foul and broke up the play and steady down. Instead, he stayed on his feet, and he did this marauding run into the middle of the pitch, and he just had a heavy touch, and he's back up on his feet. He tows the ball, and then takes the challenge on the side of the knee, and he's okay, but he was a little bit overstretched there, John, wasn't he? Yeah, he was. So Goodell has yellow carded, which is the first booking of the match for the experienced, number six, the Sevilla midfielder, sometime central defender Goodell, who's missed most of this season, actually, with an injury. He's had a couple of knee operations, but came back and played in the last league match for Sevilla. So, you know, he's a little bit like one or two of the England players, like Gay and Trippie, who've missed a lot of time this season, but have just got back in time for the Euros. He's a key player for Sevilla as well. Yeah, but Bellingham, fortunately, is okay, and he's back on his feet. Certainly taking some knocks over the course of the last few months. Jude Bellingham, England's goal scorer here tonight. 21 in a few days' time, and in possession again. Bellingham, that's a great challenge. On Rice by Lukic, the ball had long gone there, and Rice also going to ground, has a glare at him. Yep, I think Serbia, just trying to let England know, they're not going to have it all their way with the ball, and get a little bit tied to come out and pressure a little bit, whether or not they feel they haven't done that well enough in this game, and they get a message from the side of the pitch to get a little bit tied to it. It certainly looks like that. Bellingham tried to use some excellent footwork to go between two players, wasn't able to do so this time, and Serbia knocked it back to goalkeeper, Rijkevic. So now, with... And they put the ball out of play, because there's a Serbian player down, it's Kostic, who's just sat down in the middle of the pitch. So while he receives some treatment, you can hear the noise inside the stadium. The England supporters singing the anthem. So we've got 40 minutes on the clock. Jude Bellingham, who's now scored at a World Cup, and a European Championship, and he's only the second man to do that before the age of 21 to score in both of the tournaments after Michael Owen. So Owen and Bellingham have both managed to do that, and still Kostic's receiving some treatment. So what's the mood like down with you behind the goal, is he Christensen? The fans are still firmly in full voice. The noise has been incredible from the England fans, and just interesting, we knew that the Serbian threat was going to be from wide areas, crosses into the box, but fully agree with what Matt has said in commentary about Mark Gaye. The positioning and the way he's stepped in, he's been unbelievable, and Declan Reis has been dropping in to help defend the crosses, and the latest cross that came in from Serbia, Declan Reis just got so much power on the defensive clearance, and then the positioning of Bakaio Saka coming in, doing his defensive duties as well. England look really solid so far. Kostic still receiving treatment, and while that was happening on our little screen here, they were showing Matt the celebration, which was for the Bellingham goal, which was primarily involving Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold, and I've heard this week that they've been spending a lot of time together, the two of them, they both went down onto one knee. I have to say, I'm not sure what that was from. Anyone else got any idea? You're looking around like we should know, John. I suspect it might have come from something or other. Somebody will know, but it looked very rehearsed, didn't it? It did. When I said to Garissel get yesterday, what have you been working on? He didn't mention goal celebration. I think what was interesting about that replay is the run of Harry Kane, because he just takes the defender out of the space into that near post there, he makes that run across, and it was a nasty deflection from that cross from Saka. He almost tries to hit it along the ground, but it goes under the foot of the defender, and it really does kick up off the turf and loops into the box brilliantly. I'm not sure Kostić is going to be able to continue. He had that look on his face, John, when you can see a player and they kind of know or feel like they're done. And he just had this dejected look on his face when he was down on the grass at the start of that injury situation. Oh, he's going to kick the ball away. John Stones has kicked the ball away when a throwing had been given to Serbia. And Mitrovic immediately, and he is the captain, immediately appealed to the referee, the action should be taken against John Stones. Unfortunately for England, the referee has not shown a yellow card. And yet there is a change for Serbia, and it is Kostić who's coming off just before halftime, not sure what happened to him. He just sat down on the pitch, and he's being replaced by the number 25, who was a possibility to be in the starting line-up. Yeah, the Panathanaikos man, Philip Mladenovic, and he is on straight swap at left wing back. Yeah, I don't think there's too much to choose between those two in terms of selection. I think that's quite a tough call for Stojkovic, so it shouldn't affect Serbia too much. Yep, so now the number 25 Mladenovic at left wing back. Serbia, Nile, England, halftime approaching. We'll have more from the US open, by the way, from Ian Carter. The commentary is on Sports Extra right now. Rory McElrion, now one shot behind Bryson Dišanbo, in the final round, so it could be a gripping night there as well. Here is Rykovic, the goalkeeper, long through the middle. Mitrovic chests this down, and gets no change out of Declan Reis, bounces back to Pikvod, Vlavač trying to close him down, but right-footed away by Pikvod. Brilliant control from Saka, near the halfway line. Saka then running back down his own wing, inside his own half, but taking the ball away from Serbia. And then in the end, Stolz clears it to the halfway line, and Serbia back in possession. There aren't many players that ride contact or challenge better than Bakao Saka. It's phenomenal for his size. I mean, he's so strong when he's grounded. He just gets his feet in the turf, he uses his strength of his lower body just to pull people off, and then he rides that tackle, he's got that lovely shimmy, shifts the ball once he lands. It was a brilliant hold-up play from him. One-mail England, Jude Bellingham's goal. And here is Gudal, who goes past Bellingham. There's a huge cheer from the Serbia fans for that, giving Bellingham a bit of his own medicine back to the halfway line. It goes. And then Milinkovic Sabic is the other man in this Serbian team who's playing his football in Saudi Arabia now. Milinkovic Sabic comes back centrally. They want them to have a goal from distance, but instead, I think he was in two mines, actually, Sasa Lukic, and just played a ball over the top that bounced through for a goal kick. And we have two minutes of added time at the end of this first half to play, and England leading through the Jude Bellingham goal in the 13th minute. Yeah, I'm thinking that the performance has been a very solid one from England. I think we're coping well with that threat that Serbia have when the ball's wide crosses in the box. As he's mentioned, Declan Rice getting back in that space to help out the two centre backs. If any of the balls are loose or just fading away to that penalty spot area, he's in there to clear the headers. And we're picking up the pieces pretty well. And then he's still only 1-0, so there's a lot to play for, but it's pretty solid from England so far in this opening 45 minutes. Yep, solid, but a 1-0 lead as the precarious lead. Jodanovic wins the free kick. Mitrovic plays it back towards the halfway line, and England drop back behind the ball again. Harry Kane's been quiet, I must say, in the match. Yep. It's Bellingham and Saka and Rice and Alexander-Arnold, really, that I think the eye has been drawn to primarily. There's Mitrovic just plays the ball back, centrely it comes square to Lukic, and then Lukic across here to the right-hand side, to Zivkovic again, who's up against Trebia. The right foot had left back, and now the cross from the right, in towards the back post, John Stones got something on it, and was able to miss-hit it beyond the far post. There was panic stations there for a moment for England after the cross from the right. Well, that was a bit chaotic, I mean, it was a big collision, I think with Walker and someone at the back post initially, they got back up with the feet, and that was a tricky ball for John Stones to deal with. You've almost got to time it to guide the ball out of play, along with the flight of the ball as well. It was a really hard one to clear for Stones. So it's a Serbian corner from the left-hand side, in added time, it's drawn into the near post, and cleared away by Bellingham, who got there first ahead of Milinkovic Savic. But Milinkovic Savic is back in possession for Serbia. But that's it, the Serbian attack comes to an end, because the referee blows his whistle for half-time. So we weren't sure what to think about England coming into this European Championship after the... Everything that happened last week, with the squad being cut to 26, and all of the stories and the Iceland defeat. But the first 45 minutes have been played, Matt Upps and England are winning 1-0. Yeah, I mean, it's a performance so far of confidence. It's got some purpose. It's a million miles away from what we watched at Wembley against Iceland. And you get a feeling that it's business-like from England. They've been decisive when they're needed to be, in terms of using the ball and being positive, and sliding those balls in behind Bellingham, has been everywhere, and has been outstanding. And as I mentioned, Mark Gehrig, I think, has been brilliant at the back for England defensively. It's been a good opening 45 minutes to this Euro for me. So, down the golden steps, all of the players. Bukaj Osaka is the last man off the pitch, and down the golden steps to make their way through that mineshaft-style tunnel that takes them towards the dressing room. But the first half at the cool face has been OK for England. Serbia Nil, England 1, and Kelly Kate is here with us in Gelsenkirk. Kelly. John Murray and Matthew Upsson watching on from our commentary position here at Gelsenkirk. And then Izzy Christensen is pitch-side behind the goal, was behind Jordan Pickham for that first half, and will be behind the Serbia goal for the second half. And I'd be hoping to see some action in that goal in the second half. But as far as the first half is concerned, what did you make of the England team and the set-up? I know Matt describes it in the first half as incredibly fluid, certainly the freedom that those midfielders were given. Yeah, I think he just actually just said it there at the end of that first half, business-like. And I've thought the exact same. There's a real strut about England, there's a real flow. You know, I'm pitch-side here, and I can see the way the back four and Jordan Pickford are communicating with each other. They look fully in control, and as soon as there's a moment where they drift out of control, they're snapping each other back into line, because they know 1-0, like John said in commentary, is very precarious. They've got to keep their foothold in the game, keep turning the screw and get that second goal. But Serbia have looked a little bit of a threat towards the end of that first half, and I think England will be pleased to go in with that 1-0, and they can have a discussion in the change rooms with the manager and see where they can keep getting better. Yeah, there have been a couple of moments for England where maybe it looked like Serbia could get something in that first half, but obviously they lead. And the goal map from Jude Bellingham, again, it's an opening goal of a tournament from Jude Bellingham, but just his all-round performance in the first half has been excellent. Yeah, I mean, it's just so animated and pumped, is it? I almost want to say, just steady down a little bit. I mean, that sounds crazy, but I don't want him to get hurt. I don't want him to overrun a ball and get stretched and get injured or anything like that. But he's just been brilliant. That goal I loved. I just love seeing goals. That is so committed. It's relatively simple, but executed really well. And it's just about anticipation, that desire to want to get in the box, which he has, and that's why he scores so many goals. But he really threw himself in there. It was a powering header into the roof and the corner of the net, and just a great goal all around for me. Yeah, the best players always can do the complicated stuff, is he? But sometimes it's the simple thing that is the best choice, and the best players always make the best choice. That's right, and Matt actually alluded to it in commentary, and I was nodding along here pitchside when he said it, because the run of Harry Kane, not many people will notice that. They'll just notice the finish from Bellingham, which fully agreed great finish, great commitment, and the third man run into the box. But the run from Harry Kane, just to distract the Serbian defence to that front post area, it just opens up the gap. And it all comes from Karl Waukham, Bakao Saka. There's a little bit of chat about Bakao Saka coming into this tournament, not necessarily in his best form, but I think that's more of a reflection on the standards we expect from him. But the way that he made that run in behind and got the cross away, yeah, a bit fortuitous with the deflection, the way the ball arrived into the box. But the Harry Kane, Bellingham, duo inside that six-yard box is lethal. Is he six touches in the Serbia box compared to just one in Jordan Pickford's area in front of you? Is he so hopeful there'll be a bit more action for you in the second half, a bit closer to where you're standing behind that goal over towards our right? So, Izzy, for now, thank you very much. Izzy Christensen with us throughout the evening here on Five Live Sport. Matthew Upsham and John Murray are your commentary team. We will have second half commentary of England's opening game of Euro 2024 against Serbia. They lead by a Jude Bellingham goal to nil at half-time. Second half commentary coming up and the rest of the day's sports news after the BBC News with Karl Hartley. The voice of the UK. And the home of the Euros and the general election 2024. This is BBC Radio Five Live. Thanks, Kelly. Police in Germany are investigating after some England and Serbia fans clashed ahead of this evening's game. Officers say the two groups were separated and seven Serbians arrested. Our sports correspondent, Andy Swiss, who's inside the stadium explains. There have been a few disturbances this afternoon in town, although they seem to be involving Serbian fans rather than England fans. In fact, UK police have issued a statement and they say that at this stage we do not believe that any UK nationals have been arrested. Earlier, German police shot and seriously injured a man who threatened officers with a petrol bomb and small pickaxe near a Dutch fan zone in Hamburg. Officials say the incident is not football related and the suspect is being treated for his injuries. A third food manufacturer has withdrawn certain products because of fears of e-coli. The company, This, has recalled it's This isn't chicken and beer can wraps sold only in W.H. Smith. Around 200 people have fallen ill with e-coli in recent weeks. Dozens of countries attending the Ukraine Peace Summit have used the final declaration to commit to Ukraine's territorial integrity. They called for dialogue, the return of all prisoners by both Kiev and Moscow and for Russia, which wasn't invited to return Ukrainian children. It's taken. Several countries didn't sign the final communique, including India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Ukraine's President Zelensky warned that time was not on his country's side in Ending the War. Moving to peace means acting fast. Preparations will take months, not years. So, when the action plans for peace are ready and when every step is worked out, the path will be open for the Second Peace Summit. And thus for Ending this war. An Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he thinks it's unacceptable that his military is introducing daytime pauses in its activity in a part of southern Gaza.

With Kelly Kips. On Five Life and BBC Sounds. Five Life Sport comes to you from Gelsenkirchen this evening, where England's Euro 2024 campaign is up and running. They lead Serbia by a goal to nil at half time. Second half commentary coming up from here very shortly. On Sports Extra right now, this commentary from the final round of the US Open. Ian Carter is watching and Ian, it's very tense. It really is. Bryson De Chombeau is still at the top of the leaderboard. He's at six under par one over for the six holes that he's played so far. Rory McElroy, just two shots behind. He opened up with a brilliant birdie at the first, but dropped a shot at the par five fifth, where he was very unlucky. Bouncing off the green into an awful lie in the native areas. So he is at four under par, two shots behind. Patrick Cantlay has just picked up a birdie that puts him in a share of second place at four under. The course is proving a real test for these players. Mathieu Pavant, still contending as well. The Frenchman at three under is three shots behind. Thank you very much Ian. Sir Andy Murray says retiring at Wimbledon or the Paris Olympics would be fitting. And he's unlikely to play at the US Open or in the Davis Cup later this year. And Katie Balder has retained her Nottingham Open title. The British number one beat Caroleena Pleskiva in three sets. Back to the Euros and in group A Scotland head to Cologne on Wednesday to face Switzerland in an eight o'clock kickoff. Morale is of course low following that five one hammering by the host Germany in the opening game of the tournament on Friday. Manager Steve Clark has been speaking to the media today. If I could criticise myself and I'll always criticise myself, I'll start with myself. Maybe give too much information, which may be cloudy to players a little bit on the pitch in terms of what we do with the ball, what we do without the ball. So we can work on that a little bit. We worked on a little bit this morning. We'll work on it again in the next two days, going into the game on Wednesday night and hopefully see a different performance. Listen, there are no excuses when you lose a game five one. And I've been in the game a long time. So when you lose a game five one, you have to take all the criticism that comes. You have to respond. The good thing for me is being in this position before, I've always responded pretty well. The players have always responded pretty well. This group of players, they talk about them all the time and how they respond. So that's what we try to do. Sometimes it's difficult to explain to people who are not involved in professional football that they have to be resilient. They have to be resilient because it's a game, especially in club football, it's a game of emotions. So you can have a terrible result on a Saturday. And then you've got to be bouncing yourself back. You've got to be ready to go again on a Wednesday night or a Tuesday night if you're unlucky enough to be playing the championship. Because the games come thinking fast. So it's a game of, it's a roller coaster of emotions. It's the same here. They understand they've let everybody down. They're disappointed. But they know they have to be ready and up for the next game because that's the nature of being involved in football. Kicking a couple of backsides, giving a couple of cuddles, getting them together as a group, making them understand why we had that performance on Friday night and making sure we don't have that performance again. That was Steve Clark speaking ahead of Scotland's game against Switzerland on Wednesday in Cologne. There's commentary of that from eight o'clock on Five Lives Sport. Earlier today at Euro 24, the Netherlands beat Poland by two goals to one. And then in England's group, it finished Slovenia won Denmark won. Denmark opened the scoring. And that goal will be one of these stories of this or any other European championship. Slovenia, Neil, Denmark, Neil Ballforster. Ericsson with his right foot on the half volley. Fantastic goal for Denmark. And what a moment for Christian Ericsson, who three years ago in Copenhagen admitted he thought he'd almost gone from this world. Well, he's right here, right now, runs under the ball, finishes for Denmark and celebrates a superb goal. Slovenia, Neil, Denmark won. I do think this time in the Euro is my story is very different compared to last time, which obviously is a big thing for me personally. But obviously it's been a lot of games since the last time and since that happened. So that hasn't changed. So also the interview I did before, I felt confident going into the game and confident in playing again. So in that sense, I was just happy to be back playing. And obviously qualifying for the Euro is always special for your country. I did have in mind that I hadn't scored that Euro. So obviously that was on my mind, but nothing else than football was on my mind. So I'm really just happy to help the team with the first goal. But yeah, obviously in the end, there would have been a different story for you at the three points. It would also be a lot happier and a lot more confident. But I think it's all the wake up call for us to go into the next game. That was Christian Eriksson speaking after scoring Denmark's opening goal at Euro 2024. 1,100 days after suffering a cardiac arrest against Finland in Denmark's opening match of Euro 2020. And John Murray, while Christian Eriksson has played in games, he's played in significant games since then. And he's played healthily in games since then. This one feels like a milestone. Yeah, very much so. And I had that spelled in the at Brentford, which was really important for him. And then got the move to Manchester United where this season, I mean, he's been very much on the fringes, Christian Eriksson. And I have to say, preparing for the Euros last week when I was looking at Denmark, I was thinking, well, I wonder how much he is actually going to play. But there he was in the starting line-up. So as you rightly say, we've got one of the stories already of the tournament there today, as Ali so brilliantly described. Yeah, lovely story for Christian Eriksson, who opened the scoring for Denmark in their one-all draw earlier today against Slovenia. That, of course, is in England's group. In England, are set to face Serbia, the second half of their gaming group C. Jude Bellingham scored in the first half to make it England one Serbia nil so far in this one. Matt Upsen, as the second half approaches, you described England's performance in that first half as very fluid. The position of the players was very fluid. And I think that's particularly interesting, given how Garis Southgate teams were described in his early days, and that they were very organised, quite rigid, and depended really on set-piece goals. Yeah, I agree with that. I think the style of the player almost lends itself to it. I think Saka's the one that really holds his position. He loves that touchline. He wants to be wide. He wants those one-on-one situations. But when you look at the likes of Bellingham and Foden, and even Alexander-Arnold to a degree, although he has to have a bit more discipline, you've got the back-up of Declan Rice, who is missed the discipline, who will not go missing. He'll always be in the right place at the right time. So it gives them that flexibility to maybe take up slightly different positions. Well, the lines are open for 6-0-6. You can have your say on England's performance after the final whistle. Chris and Robbie will be here at 10.30 after we've brought you all the reaction to this match. The number is 0808-5909-693. And with you for the second half in Galsenkirkens. Matt Upsen and John Murray. Yes, thank you, Kelly. Hopefully during 6-0-6 we'll bring you the interviews live from down in the tunnel as well on whatever unfolds in the remainder of this match. Where England lead through Jude Bellingham's goal in the 13th minute. Fine header from Bukaj Osaka's cross that was just slightly deflected as as E. Christensen was saying just before halftime. And that was quite significant, wasn't it, that little deflection? Bounced it down and up and across for Bellingham. He gave the trajectory of that ball which was literally perfect for the way and the timing that Drew Bellingham arrived and really powered that header. I mean, it must have been a lovely moment for him just to score that kind of goal in that kind of moment. Dragon Stojkovic is going to make another change here and Gudal is going off. Nemanja Gudal is substituted at halftime and Ivan Illich of Torino is going to replace him. The 23-year-old who actually was at Manchester City as a youngster, you might remember Ivan Illich. But the Torino man, so Gudal, who has been booked and his fitness was an issue. It's been a little bit off the pace, hasn't he? And I think he's a top player. I think he's a really important player for them. But I think he's had two knee surgeries this season and only came back for the last 20 minutes or so of Sevilla's last game of the season. So to then step into this kind of game against the players that he's playing against is a big ask for him. Well, funnily enough, Illich has had a knee problem this season as well. But he's on the number 17 into the midfield, so that's a straight swap. And England, as they started the match with Pickferingol, Walker, Stones, Gae and Trippier, Alexander-Arnolden-Rice, Saka, Bellingham, Foden and Keane. They're running you through the Serbian team in a moment. But second half, very much underway here under the sometimes closed roof of the Arena Ralf Schalke. But it is open today. I think there's a little bit of rain coming in actually, at the moment, through the open roof above our heads, just beginning to get dark in North Rhine, Westphalia, as the ball is played back to goalkeeper Rykovic. So Serbia with Rykovic in goal, the three central defenders, Velkovic, Milinkovic and Pavlovic, then Zivkovic the right wing back, substitute Mladenovic now on the left after Kostic had to go off with an injury. Milinkovic-Savic, Illich and Lukic with Vlahovic and captain Mitrovic with the squad captain, Dusan Kadic, on the bench tonight, the former Southampton man. Serbia in possession inside the England half, but it's one back, Bellingham just stabs it out to Trippier on the left-hand side, it comes back to Bellingham in now this deep-lying position. That hits a marvellous pass to Saka. First-time touch from Saka, back to Alexander-Arnold on the halfway line. He turns, find Keane. Keane only two touches in the first half and this pass hits the referee, Osato, who apologises to Harry Keane and it will be an uncontested drop-off. That pass was on as well and Keane doesn't misplace those passes. It was going right in the path there of Walker on the overlap, but let's just take a little moment for that Drew Bellingham pass. It was a proper drilled grass-cutter, wasn't it? Across the pitch, zipping along, super pass. Technically, the confidence that he has at the moment, he's just on Cloud nine. Yeah, it is. Melanchovic put in a heavy challenge on Bellingham, but he's okay back on his feet. And Serbia in the all-red kit, or at least with the white and blue trim as per the flag. Find the ball to the left-hand side where Melanchovic's savage is able to play it in towards the edge of the box. Lukic is there, but Gage as well comes across anticipated. Great reading of the game there, wasn't it? I mean, he's been so sharp with that, Mark Gahey, super performers from him so far. All those doubts about the kind of partnership almost, Gage, he's just been at the standout performer in that back four. Yeah, Gage and Stonze, this is only the third time that they've started together as central defenders for England, but they have to defend here as Rice puts in an excellent challenge on the edge of the box just to get there. He'll sort of extend at his leg and it's played downfield to Saka, Saka up against Pavlovic. He's already beaten him, all ends up once. Saka has been forced back towards the edge to the half-way line, but the crossfield pass from Saka just gives possession back to Velkovic and Serbia have got it again inside their own heart. It's just those little moments, John, isn't it? This one-nil scoreline, even though England will be happy with a lot of elements to their first half performance, it's just a bit edgy at times because we know it's just these little moments of slight mistake or a real quality piece of play that just brings Serbia back in this game. John Stonze has to tidy up his own slightly misplaced head-at. Pickford underarms it out to Declan Rice. It just turns full 360 degrees. Ball stationary at his feet as he passes the ball to John Stonze who goes back to Jordan Pickford. First-time touch from him and then passes out to Rice who has a look over his shoulder. Malenkovic savages there. Fodin's actually dropped all the way almost to the edge of his own penalty area. Back it goes to Pickford again, boos from the thousands of Serbia fans. Pickford takes his time and then clips one of those passes up towards Harry Kane against Malenkovic, but Malenkovic actually comes out with the ball and back it goes towards the edge of the box. Yes, apparently, Opta reckon that Harry Kane had just two touches in the first half. Yep, I would say that felt about right and a lot of his movement was just trying to occupy space. I think he's playing a different role because of the players he has behind him. He's not going to be dropping into the area. He's not going to be on the toes of Bellingham, is he? He's going to try and vacate that space to give him the space to operate and Fodin's have come in there. So I think out of all the players, it probably affects him the most, doesn't it? And you've got to be careful with that because he's our most effective player in terms of statistically, but you know, he's figuring it out at the moment, but he's not going to be dropping too deep into that area. Alexander-Arnold is caught in possession and now looking up towards the edge of the box, but Alexander-Arnold actually got back challenged for it and there's a lovely pass forward from Walkout of Saka and Saka takes on Pavlovic, who's just about by hooker by crook, is able to stop Saka breaking forward with the ball and actually did well there. And Pavlovic now buoyed by that recent success comes away with the ball and gives it to Melenkovich Savic and Melenkovich Savic again through the middle England, just getting themselves organised. Ball goes out towards the right-hand side to Zivkovich. Zivkovich, the little right-wing back is able to win a throwing, which he takes himself back to the newly arrived Ilic, Dragan Stojkovich, the Serbia coaches has made two changes now. Again, Zivkovich in towards the corner of the penalty area to Melenkovich Savic and then quite well been, you know, it's not given us a free kick, Bellingham was challenged back to Pickford, Pickford had to be quick there, which he was left-footed ball. This is one for Kane to chase, he's up against Melenkovich, who's able to safely head it back to his goalkeeper. Last two times he's gone back to Pickford, he's gone long and I think it's been a really savvy decision. Players are dropping short, we know how teams play in and around your own 18-yard box, Foden's dropping onto the edge of his own 18-yard box. The game's poised in that way where you don't want any mistakes in the area of the pitch and I think Pickford's making really wise decisions just to go a bit longer and take the press, you might lose the ball but you're not taking that gamble, which England don't need to do at the moment. England leading by one goal to nil, but Serbia started the second half from a single in here, Blažač is ball right across the edge of the six-yard box, Trippje though able to control it for England and was able to clear it but then it's won back by Pavlović on the edge of the area, Mitrovic now just outside the D, England struggling here but Mitrovic it's a poor ball through into the penalty area and Pickford can easily pick it up. Well for the very first time Blažač showed his quality, rolled Gehe really nicely onto his left foot and fizzes the ball across the six-yard box line, just no touch from the arrival, Mladanović couldn't get on the end of it and England got away with it but a real warning shot from Serbia. Pat Upsen, England defender up here in the commentary box with me, high in the stadium on the dressing room side of the ground, Izzy Kristiansen, England midfielder is watching down from behind the goal, we'll hear from Izzy before too long but England go back towards the edge of that penalty area, England are actually attacking towards the end where all of those England fans are and Izzy Kristiansen as well behind the goal but it crosses the St George everywhere with all of the familiar name places written across the the red cross in the middle of the flag, Pickford inside his own penalty area, right foot it, Sakaž able to head that on, Forden got a touch on it but he was shoulder to shoulder with the defender, Forden crashes to the ground, it's out of play for the throwing to Serbia. There's a much different start to this second half isn't it, Serbia coming out more confident, pressing up high on England wanting to try and win the ball back in England's half, very different to the first half where England had plenty of control possession and they sat off a little bit, it's a real shift from the Serbian team. They've had a real mixed bag of results recently and at the World Cup in Qatar, their first match there as well was against one of the favourites against Brazil, you might remember Ishalas scored both goals as Brazil won 2-0 and now it is Lukic who's able to bring the ball forward but Dalingham's in front of him so Pavlovic receives it on the left hand side and then across it goes to the number 13, Velkovic right side at central defender, Pasey pass for Zivkovic to try and reach but there was no way in the world he was going to reach that and it's all the way through for a goal kick for England. Well these are the moments where England just need to be calm, get a hold of the ball and start to assert a little bit more dominance on this second half, it's been a little bit patchy, a little bit ragged, we could start to look a little bit tired, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a freshening up of legs relatively soon. And who would you be thinking of, you can have a ponder on that because Pikvot takes this goal kick long and high over the halfway line, Kane looking to head it on but he's beaten in the air again by Milankovic and then Kane goes down in the challenge with Mitrovic and wins a free kick, classic Harry Kane, he's very good at making and winning those free kicks. Yes, he does that extremely well, really clever, uses his body so well. And he walks away with a little bit of a perqueness about his stride, England take the free kick back to Kyle Walken out from Sackler and Walken goes back towards the edge of the penalty area. So one nil but England not necessarily at the moment threatening a second goal, Bellingham with it inside his own half, then Gae, Alexander-Arnold still just inside his own territory to the right of the centre circle but then goes for one of those long Trent Alexander-Arnold passes which is chested down by Trippia pushing up from left back, Kane with a first time touch, Bellingham now 25 yards out, Foulden back to Bellingham, Rice square from him, Alexander-Arnold right foot shot pushed out by goalkeeper Rykovic, he's right at him but it was hit with power, probably wobbling as well so he just got his hands to it and pushed it back out into the penalty area, better from England, much better, Walken then to Rice, 30 yards from goal, Rice finds the ball to Alexander-Arnold into the box, pulls it back now, Bellingham on his left foot, in comes the challenge from Illich and a good one as well to win it for Serbia. An interesting selection from Trent Alexander-Arnold, he has the touch and waits for the cutback for Bellingham but I just felt that first time right footed cross fired across the six yard box, nice, Serbia were in big trouble then recovering back into their own box, I don't think they would have dealt with it very well. One now England lead and suddenly they've upped it now in the second half, Jude Bellingham, right foot control, little left foot pass to Foulden and then back to the halfway line, lines open for 606 by the way from 1030 or so tonight, Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton standing by, Chris is out here in Germany with us, they want to hear what you think of this England performance, 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3, text 8 5 0 5 8, hashtag BBC 606 as Declan Rice is able to take possession back for England in the centre-surfer. Alexander-Arnold now to the right, it's been a great discussion hasn't it Matt, who would play alongside Rice, Alexander-Arnold has done so far, so very good, Alexander-Arnold again back in field to to Bellingham, passes it behind Foulden, actually Trippie is going to have to come back and get a touch for England, Foulden back to Marguerite on the halfway line and then John Stones is able to receive that from his central defensive partner with no Harry Maguire here in Germany with England this time because of his injury, Trent Alexander-Arnold now goes for a long pass that's looking for Kane but that's over hit from the Liverpool man all the way through to Rykovich, what are you thinking is he Christianson down behind the goal? Well obviously that chance from from Jude Bellingham the cutback but the pass into the space from Declan Rice to Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right-hand side was absolutely delightful and over to my left I'm actually watching some England players warming up and there does seem to be a little bit of intent about what they're doing down there, there's Olly Watkins, Esser, Anthony Gordon, Jared Bowen, I think that gives an indication that Gower Southgate might be looking to add freshness into the final third for England if they don't find a second goal soon. Yeah I think there might be a Serbian change coming as well but here they are on the attack, Marder, into the penalty area, Marder-Arnold, Denovic is ball across, Pickford dives down, gets something on it, Gays there as well and the Serbian players are running to the referee and suggesting that there might have been a foul on Mitrovic who's down inside the box and they've got to be careful because only the captain can run and appeal to the referee and I think Danielio Sato might have something to say about this, Pickford diving down at the feet of Mitrovic, what do you think Matt? Yeah I think Kiran Trippia just gets his legs across and there is contact with Mitrovic but I think Trippia Mitrovic at equal distance, kind of from the ball and he's just trying to shield himself in there, Mitrovic really gambles, he just throws his body in there like a centre forward would do to take the contact and... Well they'll be looking at it, VAR and it's one of the best men, it's the top man actually, Massimiliano Eratti who seems to be the VAR for virtually every match I cover in Europe that he is the top of the tree they say, we've got no indication yet whether VAR will call the referee to the side of the pitch and we've got a screen here that tells us if VAR are going to look at something and the referee is just waiting to restart play, the players have gone for the water bottles, these are quite anxious moments, aren't they? Yeah they are, I mean for the first time it was a tough one because John Stones had to match the run of a player that had momentum going past him, it's very difficult to match that run but he does quite well to stop the cross fully coming in but then it's just that coming together between Trippier and Mitrovic, I think they're in the clear, I think so, it doesn't appear to be like there's any intent on this check at all, even if there is one, they'll be looking but yeah and now we're going to actually have a double change and that's it from Mitrovic, so the man who knows England and the Premier League so well, the former Fulham and Newcastle centre forward, thought he might have won a penalty there but that's the end of his involvement and he'll take off the captain's armband and he'll give it to Dusan Tadic, another former Premier League man and it's a double change, actually Serbia are also bringing on the Milan forward Lukáj Jopic to play up front so the number eight Jopic comes on to win his 36th cap. Wow, that really shows you where Serbia feel this game is going, what a really offensive change, that is from Stojkovic, I mean you've got Tadic in there, Jovic, Vlávic, you know really are going for it to be honest with those changes and I think they sense that England are a tiny bit on the ropes John and that there's something there for them if they really push it and they're going to give it a go here. Yeah and it is Lukáj who's been replaced by Dusan Tadic so it's made four changes now, Dragan Stojkovic so Dusan Tadic, Serbia's most cap player comes on to make his 109th appearance for his country and their record goal scorer, Alexander Mitrovic is now off the field so he can't affect things. I think it's going to be interesting during this World Cup to see how the Saudi players look, you know most squads have got one or two in the case of Serbia who play Saudi Arabia, what did you think Mitrovic? I mean for Mitrovic with his style I don't think it affects him too badly because he's not like an electric mover is he, he just takes up really good positions, I don't think Milinkovic Sabic has been as good as what I would expect from him and whether or not that is that involvement in the Saudi League, the level's not quite the sharpness and the standard isn't quite up there and I don't think he's been particularly effective today for Serbia, I was expecting more from him. I think we'll need a full sample size won't we, all of the matches to make a proper judgement on that. So Dragan Stojkovic has made four changes, Gareth Southgate still waiting to make his first and we are now in the 63rd minute and England still leads through the Jude Dalingham header set up by a combination of Walker and Saka which seems like a long time ago now and Serbia it's been much more even in the second half and Serbia certainly had more of the ball, could barely have had less of it as the ball is played out towards the right hand side. Back to the halfway line it goes to Belkovic and across to Milinkovic, Milinkovic tall, big shoulders, Krukut, Pavlovic and then back to Milinkovic, Krukut almost goes with the territory doesn't it, if you play in central defence for Serbia. What are you saying John, you're not pigeonholing centre backs again are you, needing crew cuts and have to be tall today. Chris Perry incidentally five foot nine, you are right, there you go, here is Milinkovic, then back to Pavlovic, Pavlovic curls one forward down into full back position, nice flick, Milinkovic is under this, Milinkovic goes to the byline, then the cross from the far side, stretching header but it should be headed away and is headed partly away by Kyle Walker out towards the far side. England coming under pressure now after Stojkovic's changes. Yeah they're really sensing it, you know those changes do indicate the mindset where Serbia are and just from England having that piece of possession before that stoppage, they look fresher and I think having the ball just gives them a bit of a breather. Ladanovic on the left swings over a deep cross which is brilliantly taken down by Forden and is on penalty area, dropped over his shoulder and the touch was magnificent and then he volleyed it away over the halfway line. It's the kind of touch you want into having the other box isn't it, but that's how deep he is having to defend the corner of his own 18-yard box and drop into that space and every England player taking responsibility at the moment. It has to be said to be organised and difficult to break down but you're not going to be able to stop all of these crosses coming into the box. And here's another one into the penalty area but it's knead away by Stones and then cleared away by Alexander Arnard. We've seen this before, Gareth South getting Steve Holland discussing a change as Tadic takes the ball on on the edge of the area into the box but it ran away, Jovic couldn't have the touch. A better touch there and Joric is in for the equaliser but he just really deflected it through the pick-foot. Well it hanging on by the skin of our teeth at the moment, you almost feel there has to be a change or a change of gear and a change of personnel just to shift it because we're struggling to contain it, it's just too open. Steve Holland has called someone up from the the group of five substitutes, actually is it Conor Gallagher who's getting himself ready. What a take from Harry Kane there, brilliant use of his body, holding off the big crew cut, Malinkovic with himself and brings the ball down so gently with his right foot and then holds him off, draws the foul and it's a much needed break in play for England, get the ball in the opposition half and just take stock at the moment. Yeah England need to reassert themselves in this game, just in the balance right now. England have got the lead, they've got that one goal that they need, certainly the skills of Harry Kane in terms of holding the ball up and it is Conor Gallagher stepping forward to come into the tournament, Walker after the free kick. Now Alexander-Arnold into the box but thanks to the defender Pavlovich but it's gone behind for what actually is England's first corner. Set piece is so important for England with Alexander-Arnold and Rice but this is the first time they've had a chance so let's see what England have been There's nice hold-up play from Kane just to draw the ball in, set it wide and then Alexander-Arnold trying to get the cross in that wins the corner and he's just teeing the ball up on this near side corner, the linesman bearing down over him making sure he's not for any part of the ball outside of that little area that it has to be in by the corner flag, the quadrant referee just blows his whistle and gives Tudor Bellingham a kicking off. His influence has dropped away in the second half and with that England's superiority however they've got a corner from the right so Alexander-Arnold to take this into the edge of the six yard box goalkeeper comes gets a punch on that right fist good distance cleared further away on the edge of the penalty area, Thordan back to Alexander-Arnold still on the right his ball into the penalty area it's headed away actually came off the head of Melenkovich right across his own box and now here is Bellingham with it on the left hand side Bellingham goes one way and the other brilliant kicks on Illich beats him again left footed cross but it's caught plucked out of the sky by goalkeeper Reikovic. Yeah not quite enough on the little thing from Bellingham, lovely footwork I mean he's got this kind of reaction time but when he holds the ball and he sees a player try and make a move to just tow it away he's got the ability to react quicker I mean he's got some twitching him to be able to do that and he's just slowly jogging back in position he's just picked up here because he's realised Serbia are on the ball he needs to get back in position. One Nellingdon lead five live BBC sounds Serbia going out towards Zivkovich on the far side and England are now into the last quarter of the match Zivkovich plays it into the penalty area but it's headed away could head up by stones flicked forward by Malinkovic Zivkovich then down by Forden to Trippier and then Ryse and the pressure pass it forced to pass it out of play throw in to Serbia level with the edge of their own penalty area in England now will make the change and Conagallaga is going to come on for Trent Alexander-Arnold. Yeah I thought it might be a switch with Trent Alexander-Arnold and he's interested in his Gallagher I think it's his energy jog you know we see him play he gets about the pitch with real energy Conagallaga and I think it just needs a bit of that to win the ball back and to apply a bit of pressure we've dropped off a little bit and allowing Serbia to have too much of the ball. What do you think Izzy Kristiansen? Yeah it's interesting because I saw the signal from Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland to the bench to get Conagallaga ready as soon as Serbia are on the attack a few moments earlier he just gets the nod to come in there alongside Declan Rice just to solidify this for England because they are on the back foot at the moment. Yep they're 20 minutes away just over 20 minutes away from an opening win but it's by no means certain Zivkovic to take this throw he's actually going to take it short to Velkovic then back to Zivkovic whose cross is blocked but bounces nevertheless into the penalty area that's lifted across to the back post it's got to be watched by Saka the bouncing ball which it is and then Naidenevic gives it to Pavlovic lovely move from Pavlovic against Conagallaga who's able to block the cross out for a throw in on the left hand side. This is edgy times hanging on edgy times for England it's not comfortable at all throwing Serbia increasing in confidence all of the time Milenkovic and then Zivkovic is balling into the penalty area takes a deflection Pickford comes gets a punch on it and is able to punch it to Saka then it's fired forward but Walker is able to evade it ducks underneath it because the pass came from Milenkovic in the centre circle and it's a goal kick and referee Osato is already on to this he's already on to Pickford and says I'm watching you I know you're about to waste time. Yeah he can sense you but I mean this is where it's at every break in play or ability just to reset and slow the game down England are having to take because we just can't get hold of the ball at the moment we've got no real sustained possession and it's making us look a little bit ragged and tired. Yeah and Bellingham who was imperious in the first half you know his influence certainly has gone out of the game as Harry Kane wins the free kick for England halfway inside the Serbian half. You don't find he's got that exuberance that it all kind of comes at once almost I mean how he performed in that first half was just absolutely outstanding and the energy I kind of mentioned just to steady down a little bit and save it some of it up and you'll see all of a sudden you'll see a surge from him and he'll do something incredible and he is that game winner that game changer player Drew Bellingham so a free kick on the left after Harry Kane was fouled and Phil Forden left footed curls it high into the penalty area towards the back post it's headed away it comes out to Saka who's also dangerous in the first half Saka now left footed ball to the back post backing away Reiss nods it across took a deflection a shout for a handball from Bellingham but I don't think the referee will be interested in that and it deflected to Gorky Barajkovic. There's a hopeful shout wasn't it never going to be a handball nice delivery in from Forden with his left foot really swung it into that back post area. Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton waiting for your calls on 606. Your opinion on England's performance here tonight 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 three more commentaries on five live tomorrow two o'clock five o'clock and eight o'clock Romania Ukraine Belgium Slovakia and tomorrow night this time tomorrow night France play their first match you'll hear that with with me and Matt will be in Düsseldorf which is not too far away from here or about half an hour away from Essen which is where our base in the Rua is and it's about 40 minutes the other way but tonight it's Gelsenkirchen and England and what's turned into quite a tense affair. Saka trying to wriggle away through the middle does well actually against Illich plays the ball back to Bellingham England in no rush here Bellingham gets the ball down and then with his right foot finds Tribya on the left flank Luke Shaw is among the substitutes tonight Forden then back to Rice Ryle Rice walks into the pass to give it back to Tribya back to Declan Rice again Rice low towards the edge of the penalty area due Bellingham back to the box gives it to Forden Tribya again on the left hand side but it's not zippy this by any means the pace of England's passing they're just trying to reassert a bit of authority I think yeah yeah it's just have the ball keep the ball in an offensive area as long as we can have the ball in the opposition half and keep possession we're happy and then also you kind of get your legs back a little bit John when you have the ball this is a lot of hard work that's the goal keeps turning over changing hands you're defending cross in the box you're clearing it and then having to deal with another one Bellingham has pulled up for a foul on on Tadditch there I wasn't sure about that I must say but Tadditch has won the break gig back down to pitch side is he yeah it looks like Jared Bowen is stripping off ready to go he was just receiving some instructions from one of Garas Southgate's technical team yeah it looks like he's coming right on and Eze has been given the nod as well to warm up with a bit more intent yeah he's taking his bib off it looks like as I might be entering as well this is interesting as well it's another attacking change though first by Serbia and Zivkovich the right wing back has come off and it's the the Sparta Prague man who is the player of the year in in the Czech Republic this season Velko Biamantjevic who's come on the number 26 here's Tadditch on the far side for Serbia but he's actually given the ball away to Foden who controlled it again brilliantly that was hit at him at pace still deep inside his own half then Tribje does well beats the challenge there Foden in the orange boots stretches forward and is brought down that's a free kick and it's a yellow card for Dusan Tadditch and a free kick for Inge I mean what a first touch isn't it he's got a piece of velcro stuck on the end of his boot I think Bill Foden with that the way he took that ball in absolutely superb and then Tadditch can only just kick through the back of him as he just glides past him picks up his yellow card here's that change that Izzy was telling us about Jared Bohan is about to come on the West Ham man England's number 20 to win his ninth cab he's yet to get off the mark in terms of goals and he it is a straight swap Pukaj Osaka who as we know was injured towards the end of the season but he set up the goal the only goal that we've seen here so far tonight yes a smart move 75 minutes he's given a really high level for Kaj Osaka he's looked like his best actually inserted moments his shift of direction his sharpness the way he's going past people certainly in the first half he had Pavlovich on toast and I think that he was a big part of this performance for England right off he comes and Jared Bohan is in for his first taste of the tournament so big day for him big feeling to get involved in this sort of occasion England's first match at Euro 2024 they are winning but it is three points is by no means absolutely certain Pavlovich heads it forward and then there's a free kick on Konigalega in it and England again there's a little bit of frustration there as the ball was thrown away by Melinkovic Savic there's a sloppy foul wasn't it it's giving England a nice way to pause is halfway into the Serbia half in a wide area here's Bohan into the action for the first time the hammer of the year Bohan tries to take it to the bi-lane gets the cross in Kane is there heads against the crossbar and it bounces down and out and away so close Kane absolutely I mean physical you name it there was a defender there but Kane got his head to the ball but couldn't direct it underneath the crossbar well brilliant from Jared Bohan as well I mean this is what he does there's no airs and graces with Jared Bohan he just goes at people gets crosses in the box he flights it beautifully Harry Kane gets up over the defender at the back post powers the head up and it's a solid save from Rakovic in goal he does well to get two hands on it and put it onto the crossbar saved onto the bar well saved excellent save from the the Serbia goalkeeper that must have been about 15 yards away from you Izzy yeah the build-up was Jared Bohan's cross was absolutely delightful and then the goalkeeper Rakovic he's just actually fist pumped the air because he knows that's a big big save he tips it onto the bar like Matt said and Harry Kane thought it was nestling into the back of the net but it wasn't to be a classic Kane but Serbia coming forward a deep cross it's over the top of Trippia he's actually headed it out towards the the right hand side and Trippia at the ball went between his legs but he was able to recover played it back to Pickford and Pickford left footed quick gets it away towards the the halfway line where Kane is chasing the ball Malenkovic putting the challenge in on him Serbia coming forward again with Malenkovic savage now the the pass down the right flank England dropped back towards the edge of their own penalty area again Malenkovic savage stabs it in towards the edge of the box but straight into the path of Trippia and then Bellingham turns away with the ball and passes it for to Kane and then Kane has got a lot to do here but he's over the halfway line the England captain still going three Serbian players around him flicks it back to Foden Foden then infield towards Gallagher but Gallagher was on his heels and now Serbia will pull forward Pavlovic again as Serbia chased the equaliser Pavlovic has done well he's beaten Walker but then over hit the pass forward and down it goes into the left back area where Trippia is able to play it forward towards Foden Rice is in space in the middle of the field and receives the ball just taps it forward towards Bellingham Bellingham now as England all in white come forward and Jared Borne that's the voice of Dragan Stojkowicz who you can hear there clapping his hands and shouting just next to where Jared Borne was in possession there's an England man Trippia has gone down England's left back has got an injury problem he doesn't look good either John judging by his expression it looks a little bit uh muscular well we'll find out we'll find out what the state of play is with Luxor I mean it's Joe Gomez who's warming up I think it is down there I don't see sure warming up no so it looks as though it's a straight swap but this this could be a blow for uh for Kieran Trippia who has fought his way back in time to to be fit enough to win a place in the squad for the Euros what what do you think the problem is any idea it it looks like he's just gone down and he kind of was feeling the back of his hamstring area and laid on the floor and put his hands over his eyes as if to say do you know what I mean you kind of have that that body language to go I know I've done something well he's up he's up he's walking off the field hopefully it's just a bit of cramp or something I hope so may well be okay it's been a it's been a tough second half physically because we've not been in control so a lot of reacting a lot of loose clearances that have then been won by Serbia and then we're back on the defense again and he's had to get through a lot of running Kieran Trippia and he's just stretching his hamstrings stretching his hamstring a little bit like for those who remember it when Gordon Stracken scored that goal at the at the World Cup many many years ago and he couldn't jump over the advertising hoarding and he put his leg up on top of the the advertising hoarding and he's stretching it there so we're waiting to see what the story is is that how you stretch your hamstring guitar with you that time well since you since Dr Upson helped me with my recovery yes that's exactly the sort of thing I did England have a look over there and Trippia is coming back onto the field well let's just keep an eye on him 10 minutes to go England 10 minutes away from an opening win after Bellingham's early goal that Serbia have really put them under pressure as I think Gallagher did Gallagher handball a ball? I think I think he's done him for a high foot but I mean it was good play from Gallagher he really gets off the ball both players with a high foot okay he's stretching but that's what Gallagher's come on the pitch for to win those kind of loose second balls and apply a bit of pressure to the Serbia midfield in that area. A big sport here in Germany and Gelsenkirk and England winning 1-0 big night of sport in North Carolina as well that's your choice of listening tonight sport text that'll be on into well probably up towards midnight and the news is Rory McElroy is now sharing the lead with Bryson Dechampol after after a couple of quick birdies Serbia coming forward ball into the penalty area that's cleared away by Walker so sports extra for the commentary on the US Open where Rory McElroy shares the lead 10 years since he last won a major caddage deep lying position left footed ball stones heads that away comes out to the edge of the box left foot shot is just over the top of the crossbar I think Pickford got a touch on that the shot from Vlavic from just outside the box he did it's a Pickford save it's a corner yeah he couldn't leave it Jordan pick but he had to be certain I think it may have been going over well maybe crossbar it was a decent little save tipped over but Vlavic a couple of times in this game he's just come to life hasn't he shown that he is a quality talent yeah had an excellent season for Juventus they won the cup the Coppa Italia caddage to take this corner from the left hand side England really under pressure now to hang on to this lead that they've got caddage takes it left foot towards the far post that's headed away comes out to the edge of the area and it's headed away inside the box Pickford diving for it it was actually knotted away by Harry Kane in his own six yard area and the the captain is being roundly congratulated after England winner free kick in their own box for getting in the way of that shot well it was a big moment really because he's on target Pickford's behind the ball but Harry Kane just gets his head on it puts it up in the air and then we win a foul in the 18-yard box through the contact Serbia really furious with the referee for giving what they feel was a soft piece of contact and he's actually coming over and having a chat with Stojkovic's teetering on the edge of his technical area yes he is white shirt very white trainers very white trainers black trousers it's a great great player Stojkovic the Serbian coach real talent part of that highly talented Marseille team that Chris Waddle was in here is Jared Bowen into the challenge England win the ball back that's what they need Bowen bringing a bit of West Ham spirit to it long pass from the back gay this is for Bowen to chase but it's headed out of play by Pavlovic I mean he's been great since coming on Jared Bowen he really is he's been direct he's putting his foot in he's getting about trying to win second balls and lose that's what this game is at the moment let's not think about all the nice football and the talent we have this this game at the moment 83 minutes gone it's about doing your job yeah winning second balls grinding it a little bit and hopefully getting a bit of possession and just take the sting out of the last 10 minutes or so of this game yeah Bowen does look fresh look sharp I must say throwing taken by Walker I don't think Bellingham will get there no it's cleared away by Tadditch on the edge of the box England who've been up against it for large parts of this second half Gallagher he's he's tackled Tadditch that incomes Bellingham sliding in on his knees Jude they all shout from the England sections Bowen I bet I'm sure Bowen would love to be able to get a run at Pavlovic in the way that Bukajosaka did in the first half I thought he was there John I thought he had the option he thought about it didn't he decided to be safe and keep the ball but I think just at that moment just get hat in test the big centre back how do you think do you think Trippie is okay by the way over on the far side he's getting through it isn't he and I don't think he I don't think he's kind of stay on the pitch if he really felt he'd done his hamstring in any way nice from Bellingham again turns gives it to Kane Kane's pass is a little short actually and it's slid away towards the halfway line by Gaye comes across Vladovic is putting him under pressure wins a throw in throwing taken quickly England looking a little stretched here but there's a misplace pass Kyle Walker's onto that Walker then to Harry Kane in the centre circle just allows the ball to come to him and then is hold over by Vladovic and Kane wins another free kick that's proving to be very important for England the the free kicks that that Kane is winning and Stukovic was boot I think for something that he said dragon Stukovic so that's another coach boot and that's it Bellingham is coming off the field so Jude Bellingham the goal scorer the man who scored England's first goal in Qatar the man who scored England's first goal here in Germany has been rushed off the field by referee or Sato and I think you thought for a moment that he might be about to be booked yeah maybe I mean he's just had brilliant moments in this game his goal was fantastic what a presence he is for England what a difference he actually really does make in that part of the pitch and I can understand bringing him off in this moment he's obviously had a big few weeks hasn't he and hasn't played in any minutes in the warm-up fixtures so great performance from him really and that means Matt that the 19 year old Kobe Menu of Manchester United the man who scored what turned out with the winning goal in the FA Cup final just a few weeks ago he's on now having come from really nowhere and a bad injury at the start of this season a teenager is sent on Kobe Menu to get his first experience of big senior tournament football and England now have Rice and Menu and Gallagher on in their midfield and I think that tells you everything you need to know about where this game is Rice is a judge to a foul caddage free kick to Serbia just four to the centre circle we've got three and a half minutes of the 90 to play you just see this experience I mean there's a lot of experience on the team here for Serbia on the pitch and you just feel that they're using the tattage there winning the foul using his body not allowing Rice to get to the ball and winning a foul and a free kick and more pressure coming England's way. Foden bolleys the ball away Menu's into his first challenge Foden was able to to turn keeping his own half Foden sets off on a run over the halfway line and then is then body checked by Velkovic Foden goes down free kick to England I think Velkovic may even have made some contact on no it's just into his chest England take the free kick they've lost possession that was careless that was sloppy tattage Malinkovic Savic now back to the halfway line and England are saying to Serbia now what are you going to do how are you going to be able to find a way through as England try to hold out for an opening clean sheet and then it's with a cross excellent header away by John Stones he was up against it there but he he beat Jovic to the ball but Serbia win it back again tattage that's a little short so in steps Jared Bohan and the the ball is out of play off the west hand man for a throw in taken quickly Malinkovic Savic square from him to Ilic now out towards the far side to Velkovic and Serbia again as England just dropped back into position Nadejnavic again on the left hand side beats Bohan Nadejnavic then back to Malinkovic Savic on his right foot sends a shot from 25 yards wide of the top right corner and behind and Pickford comes out and remonstrates with his England team mates well super strike but England will be delighted he's taking the option of shooting there and it going well wide and they can just reset I mean it is really difficult moments for England it's not been an easy second half at all and to hold out if they go through this game we'd not concede in it's a it's a big tick in the box because they've been under so much pressure it's quite reminiscent of the first game at the last euros against Croatia which is also a 1-0 win and England now we're in the 89th minute in fact two seconds to go we're in the 90th minute here's Gallagher Gallagher over there to the far side right lines are open for 606 08 08 5 9 0 9 6 9 3 to talk to Robbie Savic and Chris Sutton about this England performance here tonight is it going to be an opening win really only a matter of a few minutes away from that we'll see shortly how many minutes are going to be added on Walker Walker just puts his foot on the ball on the halfway line all of this experience in the England team players like Walker stones now with a ball at his feet plays it across the mark gay and then forward towards Phil Forden who spent most of the second half in his own half and then Serbia can't keep the ball in on the far side and I see trivia just stretching again over there just off the field one foot in front of the other it's always quite hard to evaluate Phil Forden's performances for England sometimes isn't it it's like a mixture of really four minutes about a time that that's not that's not too bad actually I think England now looking in a little bit more comfortable having the ball for the last minute or so and they just need to get the territory have the ball in the Serbian half get some passes off stretch the pitch a little bit and just see this game out less than four minutes to go for England to record an opening win here in Gelsenkirk and Walker Walker to Gallagher Gallagher to me nice touch Gallagher was fouled after the ball had gone by Malinkovic Savic more applause from the England supporters and looking down on them in the stands to my right in amongst the the blue seats of Schalke standing most of them this is very tense Stubb Walker waits to take this free kick he knows he can't delay this England don't want to pick up needless yellow cards so back it goes to stones inside his own half rolls it out towards Trippia onto his right foot Trippia he has one for for folding the chase but that's headed forward by Serbia and then Gallagher is in he spotted his opportunity there Gallagher the ball bounced off the the Serbian player and Gallagher was in like a flash against Illich and won the free kick he was after I read it brilliantly didn't he Gallagher anticipation there was super he knew the touch was going to go back and he just took a gamble conner Gallagher and little moments like that you know you put a sub sub on and you want them to do a job for you I mean it's really taking responsibility and thinking well this is my job I've got to see this through and help the team and it's done that pretty well since he's come on conner Gallagher yeah conner Gallagher was an unused substitute in all of the matches of the world cut by the way so he served his time now he's on the field winning that important free kick for England one nil England lead five live as Boen can't keep that ball in play didn't have much of a chance in in all truth with the pass to him throwing is taken back by Mladenovic and then forward from Milenkovic up towards the halfway line two minutes of the four have been played now as Tadich finds the path pass to the right-hand side in comes the cross no it's blocked by Trippia excellent work against Bia Manchevic Illich now Illich for Serbia left with it to the left-hand side Mladenovic is there Mladenovic is crossed that's blocked by Boen who got his chest in the way of that one and put it out for a throw I think it's more the stomach actually took it right in the mid-riff there Jared Boen yeah as the throwing is taken Illich is going to try a shot which is blocked by Gallagher ball inside the England box bounces for Boen who just hits it away downfield that's giving possession back to Serbia Serbia now this is urgent really urgent stuff from Dragans Stojkovic's team as Pavlovic wins the throw in on the left-hand side that was blocked out of play by Boen I think he's still feeling that ball into his stomach Illich now in the centre circle England have got everyone back behind the ball we've got one minute to play we're into the final minute of added time England clinging on for the one no win into the box it goes Walker stretching heads it away and then it's hooked away by the left foot of Jared Boen Keane comes across to try and win this and what power blidging that was as as Dragans Stojkovic actually picks the ball up from the pitch the Serbia coach and I wonder what he was going to do there he ran across to Harry Kane who was lying on the pitch just a few yards away and he placed the ball on Kane's chest as he lay on the ground he's won that free kick there Harry Kane brilliantly I mean he's just got his body in exactly the right position felt the contact from Malinkovic it wasn't a lot gone down take the pressure off so England closing in on victory pickford takes this only seconds left now it's been a real real grind for them in the second half as Foden hooks one forward and it's then cleared on the edge of the Serbian penalty area and that's it the final whistle goes here in Kelsen Kierken and England do get their opening win thanks to Jude Bellingham's early headed goal what a struggle it was in the second half Serbia showed what they are made of but England yet again are able to start with a win just like they have now in all four of Garra Southgate's tournaments as the England manager in the previous three the opening win has proved to be the spring ball that has taken them far into the tournament but Matt Upsen what do you think well it just leads me nicely John into thinking about how good this game was for England in terms of what they had to deal with how good moments of the first half really were but the second half they really had to dig deep and they had to soak up a lot of pressure the defence got tested massively as a back for could they deal with it can they get on the end of teams can they get their body in the way it was ugly at times it was a bit rugged but they ground it out and I think that's a really good game for them to experience and to come through leading into a major tournament like this you've been talking all week about how you wanted to see this England team grow into the tournament there've been sayings there haven't there a what potentially lie ahead absolutely there's been big signs both collectively and moments individually we've seen a performance from Jude Bellingham at times which was just sensational Harry Kane done his job the players that came on off the bench I thought Bo and then the Gallagher really played the role they were meant to at that point the game was a bit gone wasn't it it was about just seeing it through grinding out loose balls getting hold of it stretching Serbia putting them on the back foot and I thought all those things happened really well and overall England have to be you know pretty positive over of course the result is a win but they got tested and they came through it yeah so Denmark next on Thursday for England in Frankfurt five live the place to hear that coverage of all of the matches here at the Euros but England their players move away towards all of those thousands of England fans in the stands and Garis Southgate in amongst them all they're going to Pukajosakarasi also going to Phil Fordon my goodness he worked hard here tonight and Garis Southgate puts his arms around him Garis Southgate in his first tournament remember the narrow opening win against Tunisia Harry Kane's late goal in that match do you remember at the Euros England winning 1-0 against Croatia not unlike this do you remember in Qatar as well the 6-2 win against Iran I remember saying there Matt it's not how you start it's how you finish and I think the same applies here Serbia nil England won it's finished as Garis Southgate himself applauds to the England fans and Kelly Cates is here with us up in the stands John Murray and Matthew Upton with commentary of England's victory against Serbia will be joined by Izzy Christensen who's pitch side right in front of the England fans so we might just wait till sweet Caroline dies down a little bit before we try and talk to Izzy and Joe Hart is with us as well Joe what did you make of that good enough yeah good enough some excellent stuff in the first half second half it almost felt like we were we were looking for the result but look we dug in we got the result which is the main thing 1-0 at the start of the tournament our superstar shining let's go Matt look we don't need to overreact to this but it is England so we probably will but in terms of that performance the first half an hour as Joe was saying there was some really excellent football there from England yeah it's the reason they don't carry on with that because the idea is to protect the lead or is it because it's just hard to keep that up for 90 minutes of international football yeah I felt it was a kind of a little bit insurgent and you you can't maintain that so it's going to be a little bit up and down I felt we you know fitness wise there's been a little bit of a question mark for me over the over the team as a whole to maintain that kind of tempo and I think that really got tested we looked a little bit leggy at moments but but hung in there and I think as you get the games into your body and you get that that repetition and rhythm of playing I think you get stronger and stronger and I think or I hope this team will do that I think they're capable of doing that they're a really good age but there was certainly some really really positive moments in in that first half is it just about growing into the tournament as much as anything Joe I mean as a group of players but the fans we in the media will kind of pick this performance apart but as a group of players will they go in and take job done and and actually there are plenty of positives you can take from that that are going to help us throughout the tournament yeah 100 look this team the way they're set up as Matti just said they're set up to win this tournament they're not set up to win this game and convince us and get us all singing and dancing that was about getting the result obviously ideally we come here we win 3-0 but look there was times that we had to dig in I felt we were comfortable I didn't feel uncomfortable at any point in the game I felt like we could score if we needed to but look this is the long game and if you've got it if you've got a scrape through a little one-nil every now and again then so be it but you know as we've talked about we've got some young bit exciting players and if we can get a 90 minutes out the boys then they'll blow people away let's head down pitch side now and join Izzy Christensen Izzy the guys are saying here you know it was a performance that was good enough to win good enough to start the tournament but there might well be more to come from this England side what do you think yeah I completely agree I think the first half was absolutely exceptional from England I thought from from minute one to minute 45 the way they moved the ball the way they manipulated Serbia they dropped them right off the plane that you know the ball around the pitch with speed with tempo Jude Bellingham was an absolute joy I mean you know it's no surprise saying that but to do it again on an international stage you know unbelievable and the second half was a little bit more difficult for England they found themselves defending a lot more but I think that's quite a nice space to be in obviously we wouldn't be saying that if Serbia had found the equaliser but I think one-nil clean sheet you know lots to grow lots to build on and I thought in particular the substitutes made such a big impact particularly Conor Gallagher and Jared Bowen Gallagher was exceptional picking up second balls winning fouls getting England territory and it helped them get the the win in the end yeah I want to come back to that but we'll talk about about Jude Bellingham with you Joe because he gets the the goal England fans love him and as he's been been down there but I think his name's sung pretty much more than than any other player in the in the England squad what is it that there is to to love about him from a fans perspective but also as a player look what isn't there to love about him I'm looking at him you know he's exceptional he's he's some player he's some build he's gone to Real Madrid he's stuck the number five on his back he's performed you can tell that they absolutely love him he's he's you know he's worldwide now he's there's no doubt about it but you know what the thing that I can't get over and I'm almost trying to find out if it is true but everyone speaks so highly of him as a person they cannot say you know I pulled Tom Heaton before I said what's the catch for this guy I'm not looking for one don't we wrong well you were asking about it so in a way you were looking for one well I was so pleased with his reaction he was like I can't I can't stress what what a beautiful person he is look let's just look after him let's celebrate him he's got the crowd singing he's got that edge there was four or five six times they were leaving one one on him in the first half and he just dealt with it he just got up and you know what one time he stood his ground he told him let's let's go and um and then the big moment that's not that's not a pretty goalie scored that's someone desire that's someone with courage arriving late bang head of top corner I love I love watching him play yeah for me he's just incredible and that's that almost I'm playing in the park I know it's a bit of a cliche in it you know he's playing like he's on the field in the park but he genuinely doesn't mean I'm watching the replay the goal way before that ball comes in he's running into the box with his hand in the air waving it like I'm here just just put it in there like he plays with this energy and sometimes it's a bit fits and starts because you can't play like that all the time so then he kind of has his break and he has a rest and he might just jog back into position and be out of the play but then he's coming to life again and he's just trying things is it is a joy to watch as Joe said I mean to watch him is just fantastic I wonder if with that playing in the park analogy maybe it's more that he would play on the park as if he was playing in the Champions League final probably than he would play in a Champions League final but the way he was playing in a in a park because it just seems as though that that will to win is is is innate in him it came off in the game but again late on definitely not like anything to to be concerned about as far as as far as we know but as he mentioned the the substitutions there and how well she thought they they worked it was pretty much like for like wasn't it in terms of of the guys that came on for England but what did you think do you think that it brought the extra energy that he needed at that time yeah it really did I think the game was was screaming out for a change jared bowen came on obviously a big moment for him to come on in the tournament and then straight away creating that chance for harry kane down there you know down the right hand side what a what a fantastic save by the way and then connor gallagher I thought he was exceptional he was everywhere wasn't he bought that energy when maybe it was slightly lacking in in the there was there was gaps open that weren't there any there was gaps on the field it was it was looking like a big pitch but when connor gallagher came on the energy that he bought and those second balls those fouls that he was winning they were so important in this victory we just looked a little bit leggy and then the distances were too big between us and the Serbian players and all of a sudden we lost control of the game so for me the changes you could have made the changes five minutes earlier if I'm honest because there was a couple of little scares before that but when they came on that had a great impact jared bowen is just so direct he's no frills he gets the ball he wants to drive it defenders and hurt them and he did that straight away so connor gallagher and and jared bowen playing for starting places instead of tren alexander anald and bakayo saco are they playing for a part in the in the squad are they are they finishes as garrasalke said rather than starters I think they know their place at the moment I would say I mean I mean and it's a good place for them and they're growing into of course they'll have aspirations everyone has aspirations to want to be on the pitch at the start of the game of course they do but they know what their role is at the moment and they want to grab it and develop it and move it on and that for me is you know the strength of a really good squad let us hear now from harry keane harry congratulations sweet caroline is booming around this stadium off-tour winning start was that all tonight was about yeah 100 we knew it's going to be a tough game so be opposed some good threats very physical with the long balls rely on second balls and I thought we dealt with it overall really well there was a spell in the first half where we got camped in our box a little bit and we found it difficult to get out but overall I think we deserved the win and it's in the group like I touched on before it's just about getting through so it's an important win tonight you were so dominant in that first half what do you feel changed in the second the oven they they changed their pressure a little bit they went almost man for man and we couldn't quite keep the ball well enough but it's a tough game they're a good team there's some really good players they have a good structure physical they make it a battle but we stood up to a well clean sheet in any game is important and it's good that we've got one today jubeltingen will get the headlines once again what a performance and a goal from him what's he like playing with him at the moment yeah unbelievable player you know he deserves all the praise he's getting at the moment just the way he plays the confidence he plays with and also the way he affects games you know it's important for for people with playing his position to get goals in the system that's what he does it's a great run into the box and he finished it off nicely you really got that goal in the second half there's been so much talk about england's new look attack and who's going to play around you how does it affect you how the attack plays around you now yeah i think each game will be different you know today i probably stayed a little bit higher allowed uh because they like to defend man for man i wanted to keep them deep so jude and feel could uh play in the pockets trend as well on the right side uh so i think each game will be different sometimes you'll see me drop in sometimes playing higher up but i think today for me was more about you know holding the ball up especially in that second half winning fouls uh and trying to see the game out like we did that was harry kane talking to kelly summers will reflect on that in just a moment but first we're going to go back to the us open and ian carter because it is getting very lively this championship's turning into an absolute classic and at the moment looks like a two-horse race between rory mackleroy who's on a charge and brice and de shambot who's desperately trying to cling on de shambot cannot find a fairway off the tee mackleroy is holding a load of putts at the moment over a hundred feet worth he's had three birdies in the last four holes so mackleroy is at seven under par he's on the 13th tee as we speak de shambos in trouble off the tee on the 12th he's at seven under patrick cantley's just dropped a shot so he's back to four under so it's really between those three but in realistically kelly between mackleroy and de shambot for the us open we're live on sports extra right now bringing coverage of what is turning into as i say an absolute classic ian thank you very much and as you say you can follow that on sports extra we're reflecting on england's 1-0 victory against serbia and gelsen kerkin in their opening match of euro 2024 we've just heard from harry kane is he is he christianson's been been pitched so she's behind the goal is he you were there when when harry kane's shot came back off the bar he was so close to getting on the score sheet yeah and it would have been classic harry kane he always has an influence on games and he didn't touch the ball a lot tonight as he's he's alluded to himself there he played a very unselfish role pinning the serbian backline back allowing others to to create but that would have been the moment for him and he couldn't really have done anything better the balling from bowing was was absolutely beautiful and yeah like i said harry kane he generated enough power on it he headed it back across goal but it was a brilliant save onto the bar and that would have been his moment but you know his moment will come in this tournament but his role is so important with the team and the way that he's happy to to do that just speaks volumes of him as a person and as a player yeah you were really impressed matt with with his role in the goal as well weren't you yeah i mean how he describes it there was exactly how i saw his role today he stayed out of that area i think with these players in the team the probably the player it affects the most is him and there's no better player to to lay that down because he's so unselfish and he understands his role and he's collective and and he's humble in how he plays so he's happy to stay out the way let those players do their thing he's there for the killer moment he's not bothered he wants to get on the end i mean nearly scored it was brilliant at the back post peeled off did everything right it was a fantastic save as as joe said and and he's there for those moments but he's such an unselfish player great captain and i thought his performance tonight you could tell he was just trying to occupy that back three to give the space to everyone else and it's just another role for harry kane the way his his england career has has developed to seen him take up all those different positions and that that dropping deep that we've seen him do before wasn't needed today now there's there's real ice in his veins and there's such focus about him i was watching him towards the end of the game thinking you know obviously i want harry kane to score and maybe his movement might be a bit frantic no cool calculated being in the right positions always trying to be ready getting back when needed look there's a real unity around the team and when you've got leaders like himself you know harry of all people is going to be absolutely buzzing with the limelight being almost shared or taken over by jude bellingham he just wants this team to win he wants to be there and he wants to do everything that he can to to help help an england victory is there anything in that england performance tonight matt that that maybe concerns you something that garris south getting his team will be looking at and thinking we need to work on that if we're going to progress in this in this tournament i thought we had a a few loose moments with passes and the ball a couple of times so prior to the phoeden gave it away a couple of times and a couple of other players not just him they i think we could have been better in controlling the game with the ball when it got tough and i thought we looked a little bit tired if i'm honest but then you've got players like like bellingham who's had a massive three weeks he's not played any of the warm-up games he came in you could tell he was so hyped and what that does to you energy wise joe it's like you know as a player you almost got to try and you you don't want to see him be level because he's great to watch but it was a little bit in fits and starts and just being a bit more calculated as a team yeah yeah i agree with you there and i think we could have dovetailed a little bit we could have dovetailed a little bit better when it when it did get like that you know you talked before when jude with the way that he plays um in the fits and bursts that we could have covered him but i felt like towards the end we started working out everyone's how everyone was feeling how everyone's positions were um you know huge shout out to mark gay he told me was exceptional um all the talk when i when i've come over to germany is his name's been coming out of people's mouths all the time with no actual good reason because you know he's had a good season uh he's just the only one that doesn't have all the honors around his neck in that back uh that back four i thought he was brilliant tonight really stepped in uh really calm on the ball and you know john john stones is is top end of world football when it comes to center backs but he was a little bit rusty tonight i thought gay he allowed him to play his game you look john's gonna every every moment every training session he's going to get better and better and the more mark plays the better that partnership will get he was a standout performer for me i agree gay i agree i thought he was absolutely outstanding first half he was and in the second half he didn't put a foot wrong he was absolutely brilliant is he you got a closer look at him in the in the second half yeah i i think that i agree with with the guys i think john stones looked a little bit rusty but i think the players coming into this tournament who you'd expect to be rusty harry cayne you know coming off the back of the injury at the back end of the season uh john stones obviously picking up that knock um both of those players you know slightly off it but i completely you know echo the views of of joe and matt with with gay coming in he just looks so comfortable so composed stepping in when needed to win the ball back dropping off dealing with cross as well but you know but in my position here obviously joe will be able to speak you know more on this but watching the role of pickford communicating with john stones and gay and the button and the fallback trippie and walker it's it's so interesting because he almost controls their movement is that right joe yeah he will do he'll be just giving him an idea of how and when um always given an always given an angle as best he can you know the modern goalkeeper doesn't just stand in the middle and and be available so the boys need to get their heads up because he might be he might be vacating the goal um and i thought gay he was able to stay on the ball he had enough time to look to work out what he was going to do next another shout out to kieran trippie here as well playing out of position i thought towards the end of the game he really shone and made it difficult um because there was a lot coming down that right hand side and obviously sirbio were looking to cross but i felt that we made them cross them at least 30 40 yards out the and and the box was you know we had we had a heavy amount of defenders in there and it made it a lot easier pickford made a couple of really good decisions i felt with the ball where we were trying to show for it and play probably 10 50 minutes into the second half and he could have easily got lured into that because you want to play you want to play i mean we enjoyed a chat about this last night um about over playing and went to play in the right areas and he just put his foot through or tried to hit harry kane or go long we lost turned over possession but it was a decision that i felt was really measured from his his understanding of where the game was at that moment and i think we've come on a long ways a group of players in terms of managing those situations in the game yeah definitely not doing things for the sake of it and yeah what harry was doing in what he talked about in his interview he was creating that unbelievable space where i think jordan will actually be disappointed with his quality that he didn't drop it in because the big number four that harry was fighting with you know when it was in the air it was very physical and difficult battle harry harry did very well but i think one or two times you managed to hit his feet what a player when he gets the ball at his feet and we can turn and go from there 10 15 yards into the serbian half and jordan pickford has been talking to joe is talking to john murray yes here he is we'll go from joe hart to jordan pickford that was uh that was tense jordan didn't you think um yeah a test a great test um you know we've had a lot of us some some of us four majors tournaments we've been in some couple five and a couple of um first time so that's tournament football um we knew it was going to be a competitive game um we showed our class we showed our resilience we we give it our you know we did everything we needed to do at night win get a clean shoot um their keepers made a fantastic save for for h um to go tune it up and um he's made a worldy hat's off to him but we've defended well with block low block everything i think tonight that shows a proper performance you know in tournament football yeah there's a little bit of everything wasn't there and and certainly some some very promising stuff in the first half yeah everyone knows the quality we have um going forward it's off the ball where you realize where when we're good because off the ball we're all working hard together we lose it we're we're getting our shape we're pressed we do everything together you know um to get the ball back and get the shape and um to limit the the opposition and um yeah so off off the ball's more important we're with the ball because you know the the the ability we have on the team and of course clean sheets were such an important part of what england achieved at the euros back in 2021 and that that clean sheet means that that you're now equal with peter shilton for for the most clean sheets at will cup stroke european championships that's that's not bad at all is it yeah it's great great achievement personally it's always great but i'll never take applauded to myself you know i've got a full 11 whoever whoever comes off the bench to help me um i'm there to make saves when the when the lads when the lads need me to be there the lads make blocks as well so it's a team effort but it's a great you know to be up there with peter shilton one of the greats in the game and the uh redwood cap holder um it's a great privilege to be up there but it's a team effort and um keep working hard and we'll go again for the next game to get another clean sheet well done tonight jordan thank you thank you jordan pickford uh callie john thank you very much and joe heart as you said sitting alongside me on on jordan pickford's performance not just tonight but across his england career to get to those sort of numbers that they were were talking about how much of an achievement is that you'll understand that more properly than than anyone else yeah he's been he's been exceptional every time especially in the in the tournament football but um look let's build on that let's jordan needs to be that guy now he needs to go that one stage further it's all very nice having clean sheets and lots of appearances but he'll be hungry for that medal around his neck but you know that doesn't come straight away it doesn't come in the first game of the tournament we've got to build we've got to build and a goalkeeper performing well like he is let's keep going with it and um yeah i'd love to hear him talk there very calm you know very you know very understanding of the moment and um that's the kind of goalkeeper that we need and he also talked about the the support of particularly the defense in front of him mark gaye who you guys have been talking about and praising completed 100 percent of his passes 32 of them you won 100 percent of his jewels there are only two of them and 100 percent of his tackles there was only one of them in the in the first half but it was still an all-round and performance that that caught your eye but is he you asked joe the question about the relationship between jordan pickford and his communication with with his defense particularly with the central defenders in front of him what did you see and hear from your position behind the goal in the first half well it was really interesting because obviously i know him from from everton uh football club as well and you know seen him train a lot seen him in and around finch farm the training base um obviously seen a lot of his games and the the communication he's got with the fans first and foremost the first thing he was doing before the game even kicked off is he was finding that connection with the fans and he he thrives off it and he when the when the england fans were singing england's number one i'm not going to sing it myself but they were singing that and he responds to it he acknowledges it he uses it and he constantly seeks that kind of enthusiasm from the crowd and his performance and then it translates into the game when it when it kicks off and and the way he he's so expressive with his hand gestures and you know you sometimes think like is he too wired up but but he isn't that's what makes him tick and it's what makes him perform and if england are going to go all the way in his competition that man is going to have to have an unbelievable tournament and if anything is to go by it of course it's early days but he looked really focused tonight and there was a real sense of not just from jordan pickford but quite a lot of those england players i noticed here you know at pitch level you know a real sense of hunger of arrogance of let's go one step further than than the last time let's go back to the u.s. Open where there's been another twist ian carter ten long years since rory mackerel won a major championship but maybe just maybe he's birded the short par four 13th to move to eight under par simultaneously brice and the shombo dropping a shot at the par 4 12th the shombo driving onto the green though at the 13th and he's given himself potentially a chance of putting for an eagle but as it stands at the moment mackerel with five holes to play holds a two-shot lead here eight under par with brice and the shombo at six under sports extra for that one then of course from 10 30 on five live it's going to be 606 reacting to england's win against syria 0808 590 9693 is the number and chris Sutton will be there alongside robbie savage what do you think chris what's going to be the major talking points what will have got england fans hot under the collar well i mean personally i thought it was a great start i think england lost a bit of control in the second half but no doubt kelly they'll have there'll be some negative normans voting in doubting gareth southgate and uh and and the performance especially with the second half looking ahead to thursday i suppose should gareth southgate make any changes did the trend alexander analdon wasn't an experiment he put him in did that did that pay off i've heard the guys um and as he talked about gay he who was phenomenal tonight i think doubts going into the tournament over the england backline but he was someone who came out of the game with uh with great credit but in tournament football you want to start with a win england have done that i think it's a great start but there will be people who uh wanted who would have wanted far more from that performance i suppose chris felt they'll look at those players and think or perhaps argue even though it's only the first game of the season that it could have been a bit more attacking it could have been you know a bit more sustained or they could have been a bit more sustained pressure they'll look at maybe spain and germany's results and think would they they were dominant yeah um but it you know it's the first game uh of the tournament for england and it's all about winning and you i think we look at england's attacking players and they didn't i thought in the first half very good and but it didn't quite click in the second half i think there are england fans out there who will think maybe you know gareth could have thrown col pama uh into the mix and i understand that but in the end it doesn't matter a win's a win and as long as england progress throughout the tournament three points now that's a that's a brilliant start but gareth does have his uh detractors and you know i mean we all have our view on who should have uh who should have started the game it'll be interesting to hear what the listeners think about the trend alexander arnold um is that is that the main question do you think in terms of team selection who plays alongside deck and reis there i think so i think that there's uh you know there's that sort of legitimate argument how many times has as trend played that role in uh in his career he did he did make a mistake didn't he in the first half um where mitrovich shot just passed a post where it's a it's a different position when you're out at right back you don't have anybody behind you those those little things uh things at the top level you know if you're trying to win a major uh a major championship which england are you know is that is it going to be a moment like that where you know trend isn't used to that position which could cost him i get the argument both ways in truce kelly because he has such a wonderful uh range of passing but who could do a better job than trenton now not like you to be neutral chris i'm sure by the end of the show he'll have formed a stronger team and you'll be sticking to it for the duration of the tournament uh chris looking forward to listening to that with you and and robbie 08085 9096 93 is the number for 606 if you want to have your say in the meantime we can hear from player of the match jude belligan with kelly summers well jude congratulations jude belligan mania continues your goal means englander off to a winning start how did you see it out there yeah good game i thought uh you know they're uh very tough side they're very robust strong a big big group of lads and yeah it was important that we we prepared well for this game and we did the staff got it right we prepared all well all week very well and when it came to the game we knew kind of the roles we had to do we knew it was going to be a tight game i know there's been a lot of goals in the other game but i think we try and keep to our own standards and try and play the opposition that's in front of us and not kind of the theme of the tournament if you like so important that we got off to a start um yeah so positive inside the camper but onto the next one let's discuss the goal because the manager said he wanted you to arrive in the box last night tonight and have an impact like that and that's exactly what you did yeah you know i've got used to kind of getting in the box playing wide or taking people on through the middle getting the ball wide and making into the box i've got into the habit of madrid and i wanted to carry my form into the euros as well and yeah it's a great start for me personally to get me confidence up and uh yeah to help us win the game is the most important thing what's the celebration with tren alexander anald about just when we play wolf one of the staff loves one of that loves that face when he um when he doesn't have a clue what's going on so that was kind of a little group celebration for the wolf or the wolf crew you also look like you took some pretty heavy challenges out there is that something you're having to get used to yeah yeah i think um since i probably started playing at birmingham it's something that i kind of i've had to get used to um before i probably not handled it the best in terms of letting myself get involved in a fight but i think this time and today i felt really calm i felt relaxed i know my teammates have my back so yeah i think i've got to be ready for everything over the next seven or six games now and i'm willing to do whatever it takes i'm willing to put my body through whatever to try and help the the country win the tournament that was jude bellingham talking about amongst other things the celebration that he had with trent alexander anald where they sort of went down on one knee in front of each other and covered their faces which he said is part of this wolf game so if you're anything like the rest of us you're going to be frantically googling what this wolf game is do you know what it is what is it so you have you have villages you have um there's all different characters and then usually two people will be a wolf in a group everyone's covering their eyes and then questions and accusations are being thrown and it's almost a bluff it's it's a really like a massive game of pretty much yeah yeah it's like you have to be a little bit like traitors well it came into it came into the squad a little while ago well long long time ago because i was there and um can't remember who bought in might have been the lester boys claire who's producing today said it's a bit like traitors yeah yeah it's like that kind of thing i think it was i think oh something that is he i think that was me that was me oh hello is he knows the game as well but it's just a big black excellent job of explaining by the way it's just a big black and it can get really spicy because you kind of have to stand your ground and then you're in a group situation someone new who thinks someone is a wolf you've got it if jude belligan's the wolf and i don't know connor gallagher thinks it's him he's got to go he's got to put himself on the line and go after hang on one second you've given us a brilliant explainer is he's told us that it's very much like traitors and given us that insight john murray in the tunnel in gelsenkirk and has the game at home yeah we've got we've got it as the wolf i love being the wolf john it's sheep's clothing and you get the app don't you there's an app that you play alongside with it but um uh yeah do you know what this is going to be the inflatable unicorn of this tournament isn't it this is the one everybody remembered bakayu sakka jumping into the pool on his inflatable unicorn this is going to be the summer of wolf i am the odd one out here i've been living in a cave somewhere i have no i have no clue what we are talking about that's what a wolf would say but that is that is what a wolf would say that's how it works can't wait to play it one day that's great do you know what we need to do we need to set we need to set is he you're right it is great deflection and we need i think what we need to do is start a game between us some kind of some kind of version of euro 2024 five live wolf but i don't want to be the person who organizes it is he it's is it one of those things that can cause rouse in the camp can do yeah i mean we've only played it a couple of times in teams i've been in and it's never really got that intense but i think if it becomes a theme and if it is like joe's saying it's been in the england senior camp for a while i imagine it is getting quite competitive do you know that there is something that's that's quite nice i know john was saying you can get the app for it but there is something quite nice when you we've heard all these stories about england camps where it's been a bit unsettled or where players have been a bit isolated and they've been locking themselves away and they've been playing on their their own consoles and that kind of thing it does there there is something quite wholesome about a sort of you know about an actual tangible board game that the players are all are all getting involved in it like i know it's a bit of a cliche thing to say but it is quite a bonding experience for them well it really is and you need to get used to that life um but all these boys are used to it you know that's that's especially now it's modern day football it's not necessarily tournament football if you've gotten away game home game you're in a hotel so you find ways of coping and and everyone's different um everyone's totally different some people want to always have their door open be around some people want to be locked away just minding their own business speaking to their families but that's they're human beings we've got to understand these boys are brilliant footballers but they're human beings they're finding the best way to cope finding the best way to get the best out of each other and i think the understandings there more importantly not everyone's going to play that game not everyone wants to be screaming and sharing it each other but the ones that do will have fun and the ones that don't be understood and left to do what they need to do that that filters onto the pitch though doesn't it i i believe i i think it has a crossover that you see on the grass and it also it breaks down barriers as well because whenever you've been away for a while you meet up again and those those barriers are there and it was Trent Alexander-Arnold involved in the celebrations with Jude Bellingham and he's talking now to John Murray yes we're just discussing the yeah the wolf game anyway more on that in a moment Trent well done tonight that must be a good feeling to to get off the mark with a win in that way most important thing especially when you're coming into a tournament um i think in the back of everyone's mind is don't lose but with the team and the quality that we've got and who we are as a nation it has to be um that's win so that was our main objective is to is to win um no however people will describe it is is however they will but for us a win is a win and we've earned it we felt like we were putting so much hard work out there and stopped them from playing the way that they wanted to as much as possible and then when you got the quality we've got attacking wires and the players get Bacchio running as um as full back and then drew the raven into the box you know you always got a chance of winning games in that sense and you playing in there you know Gareth Southgame it made it very clear yesterday that this has been a long-term strategy which has been backed up by the fact that he's played you there so often but to to start in a tournament i think for only the second time for you it's been a long time coming doesn't it yeah but it's something we have we have worked on a lot um the past year me um Gareth Steve it's not something that you know just spare the spare the moment we've done a lot of work we've done a lot of talking and especially this week i've been talked through the role um i've been guided through what how they how they want me to play how to execute it um and so it's it's a credit to them and and and how they've helped me um adapt to the position and not only that i'm playing with arguably two of the the best well not even arguably in my opinion the two best sentiment fielders in in the world so that makes it a lot easier and i hope you've realized you're going to make this we are wolf game quite big now after your celebration with tube pelican yeah i'm not sure what just tell us what it is it's difficult to describe it boy it's it's a a game of i don't know um finding out who's yeah i have actually played it yeah it's it's it's sort of go around in the group and you've got a high yeah yeah you can't look you can't look and you have to find out who's telling lies who's not um sort of game of how well you know each other's little tells and um i found a picture of us playing back in maybe october november and um i showed it to jew then we said look we're gonna have to do it obviously as is iconic celebration but we said if if one of us score um it's only right that we do it so i'm not sure how big it's gotten and how much coverage i think it's about to get big but um yeah it's uh we enjoy playing in it it's it's it's a good one for team bondon too nice one thanks Trent thank you very much thank you see it has been the night of the wolf on five live sport this evening look we heard there from from Trent alexander onlady talking about the players around him who he says are the best in the world at what they do helping him to adapt to that that new role but is that role next to deklin rice up for grabs do you think matt is that is that a position if if there is one and it's you know we we all appreciate Trent alexander onlady's great strengths in in the game but this is a new role really for him so is is it something that you think garis it's going to stick to or is of all the positions that the one that is most likely to to change in the tournament goes on i think it's a really interesting thing that they're doing um you're trying to get a player into the team who you love as a talent you can't not like him as a talent is is incredible but you're trying to put him into a role which which is very central it's very important and like i say just receiving that ball with your back to goal or under pressure with the ball coming if you're you get to this level by being in those situations repetitively time and time again making all the mistakes knowing what the right thing to do is at the right time he hasn't quite been through that process so will that jump out and bite at some point and be a problem possibly but that's the gamble and that's the balance you've got to make deciders and managers whether the talent of what he does with his right peg is going to override that and you're going to go with it and and who's to say it's right or wrong i think you know chris Sutton said it you can see both sides i i get it but the repetition of playing in that position in any position you need to have done the yard and know those mistakes know the positions know the little idiosyncrasies that happen on the pitch and know what those right little choices are and he just hasn't had exposure to that Matthew Upson, Joe Hart, Izzy Christensen, thank you very much for your company this evening you've been a great pack to work with as england get there you're a 2024 campaign underway with a 1-0 win against Serbia",
