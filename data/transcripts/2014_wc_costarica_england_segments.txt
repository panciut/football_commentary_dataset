[0.00 - 6.60] P:1870.28 E:0.062010 |  Bobby, a good tempo of play. I watched Holland, I watched Brazil. They play at a high tempo
[6.60 - 10.40] P:2012.53 E:0.105890 |  with great quality. And that's what England haven't been able to do.
[10.40 - 17.92] P:1817.65 E:0.097775 |  While the referee from Algeria, Jamal Hamoudi, has blown his whistle. We're under way here
[17.92 - 25.12] P:1705.20 E:0.087425 |  in beautiful Belo Horizonte. There are some fluffy white clouds overhead, but it's a mainly
[25.12 - 30.72] P:1745.15 E:0.091890 |  blue sky. I don't know what the temperature is, but if this is winter, we'll take this.
[30.72 - 37.64] P:1692.65 E:0.091814 |  England all in white today, Costa Rica in their red shirts, blue shorts and red socks. And
[37.64 - 42.84] P:1756.82 E:0.097801 |  it's 23 degrees centigrade. And it says on Alistair Yolmins' floaties of producer, it's
[42.84 - 48.76] P:1702.47 E:0.096323 |  a sunny day. Confirmed. You're listening to Five Live, your World Cup station, because
[48.76 - 53.00] P:1454.29 E:0.096940 |  whatever happens to England, and we know they're going home, we'll be following everything
[53.00 - 58.96] P:1613.88 E:0.091463 |  that matters in Brazil 2014, taking you through to the climax in the Madagascar Stadium. It's
[58.96 - 65.68] P:1634.31 E:0.095952 |  about three weeks away, something like that. So England are playing, I think, a 4-3-3,
[65.68 - 66.68] P:1593.76 E:0.069605 |  Danny.
[66.68 - 74.24] P:1749.02 E:0.101907 |  I think it's where you're clearly back four. 4-4-1-1 perhaps. Maybe Alain on the left-hand
[74.24 - 75.24] P:1948.95 E:0.085802 |  side.
[75.24 - 78.44] P:1714.12 E:0.094862 |  Milder's playing in a central position at the moment.
[78.44 - 85.80] P:1710.69 E:0.093703 |  But I think it will change slightly. But I think maybe it's a 4-4-1-1, as we talked
[85.80 - 91.24] P:1791.75 E:0.091879 |  about. Maybe packing that midfield a little bit more, giving it a little bit of protection.
[91.24 - 96.60] P:1604.06 E:0.097390 |  Will Shearer and Lampard in the centre. Milder on the right-hand side. And Barclay just off
[96.60 - 97.60] P:1747.67 E:0.081980 |  storage.
[97.60 - 102.52] P:1683.23 E:0.102369 |  Ben Foster drilled a clearance high towards La Lanna, who headed on towards storage, but
[102.52 - 107.76] P:1770.23 E:0.092641 |  it's cleared by Costa Rica. And then Costa Rica pick up possession. Brenes into Campbell,
[108.76 - 111.96] P:1796.34 E:0.105387 |  just outside the England penalty. The shot takes an affliction, and it's wide. Or did
[111.96 - 112.96] P:1831.03 E:0.096366 |  it take an affliction?
[112.96 - 117.80] P:1853.07 E:0.101115 |  A level-water, the goal kick. I think Costa Rica right to complain. I think they should
[117.80 - 118.80] P:1724.52 E:0.094574 |  have had a corner there.
[118.80 - 125.20] P:1874.94 E:0.097650 |  I can't believe that's not been given as a corner. It comes off the back of Gary Cahill.
[125.20 - 128.64] P:1807.13 E:0.100378 |  Clear deflection. How the referee's missed that, I don't know. But already you can see
[128.64 - 132.64] P:1819.89 E:0.099083 |  Costa Rica, a team with confidence. They're zipping the ball around, letting's get the
[132.64 - 134.76] P:1803.66 E:0.092090 |  ball and make things happen.
[134.76 - 138.76] P:1768.87 E:0.098658 |  England look a little bit nervous. A little bit jittery at the moment.
[138.76 - 144.56] P:1670.68 E:0.095672 |  No surprise there, unfortunately, given what's happened here. But who would have expected
[144.56 - 151.56] P:1670.20 E:0.094011 |  Costa Rica to beat Uruguay and Italy? Phenomenal performance from the Central American side.
[151.56 - 155.32] P:1485.27 E:0.099957 |  England have the ball, though, on the far side of the field. And now it's slipped to
[155.32 - 161.00] P:1755.43 E:0.100605 |  the left side towards Luxor. Luxor is the future at left back. We hope, we think.
[161.00 - 168.00] P:1886.68 E:0.097991 |  Luxor plays it to his club colleague, LaLana. Close to the corner flag. And then LaLana
[168.00 - 173.28] P:1808.73 E:0.098654 |  runs it out of play. And it will be a throw in to Costa Rica. They were comfortably runners
[173.28 - 179.64] P:1629.42 E:0.090151 |  up in their ConquerCaf group to the United States. But it's one thing to be tight defensively.
[179.64 - 187.04] P:1623.32 E:0.097755 |  They've got so many players based in so-called mediocre clubs overseas. No one can expect
[187.04 - 191.56] P:1623.58 E:0.089718 |  Costa Rica to have played this well. In what wars, allegedly, the group of death?
[191.56 - 195.20] P:1725.71 E:0.092964 |  It was a very, very tough group. I said at the beginning, Costa Rica will come up with
[195.20 - 200.16] P:1818.58 E:0.101631 |  a surprise against somebody. I didn't think it would be against two teams. I thought they
[200.16 - 204.40] P:1588.88 E:0.098114 |  could pull off a result. It always happens in World Cups. You think when Cameroon's at
[204.40 - 209.12] P:1689.45 E:0.102550 |  first joined in the World Cup, that naivety sometimes does nique your goal and nique your
[209.12 - 215.24] P:1732.54 E:0.100311 |  result. I'm more concerned today about England. I'm looking for a style of play, a way of
[215.24 - 220.56] P:1725.38 E:0.100265 |  moving forward. What sort of game are England going to take? We've talked about philosophy.
[220.56 - 225.44] P:1766.67 E:0.102166 |  I want to see what the philosophy is. Is it going to be a slow passing game, possession
[225.44 - 230.64] P:1700.64 E:0.097016 |  game? Is it going to be more dynamic, get the ball forward quickly or play on the counter
[230.64 - 235.64] P:1639.01 E:0.097978 |  attack? Frank Lampard winning his 106th and final cap for his country today. What a great
[235.64 - 242.68] P:1602.74 E:0.091624 |  servant he's been as well. Sure. Back now to Chris Smalling. Smalling. And then chips
[242.68 - 248.84] P:1935.88 E:0.102775 |  it straight out of play. He wasn't under any pressure. That's poor. Throw into Costa
[248.84 - 253.68] P:1726.29 E:0.098125 |  Rica just short of the halfway line near side of the field. Not a good start from Smalling
[253.68 - 259.88] P:1669.93 E:0.093267 |  there. That'll do him no confidence at all. First few moments in a game, you want to have
[259.88 - 263.40] P:1715.07 E:0.102359 |  a good touch. You want to get hold of the ball. A couple of simple passes. You're a
[263.40 - 267.84] P:1576.71 E:0.094648 |  defender, get a header, a tackle. Something like that. When you give the ball away, it
[267.84 - 272.40] P:1541.93 E:0.100203 |  plays in your mind for the next five or ten minutes. From the throwing that was squandered
[272.40 - 278.92] P:1515.34 E:0.091414 |  by Costa Rica, it was given away by Wilshire for England. Costa Rica have a free kick.
[278.92 - 283.72] P:1636.70 E:0.095361 |  It's played towards the far side of the field. Towards Diaz. That comes to the right side
[283.72 - 289.68] P:1448.17 E:0.095793 |  again. Duarte, one of the three central defenders. He's up towards the halfway line. Into the
[289.68 - 294.60] P:1526.23 E:0.097804 |  captain, Brian Ruiz. On loan from Fulham to Fias behind. Now the play switches to the
[294.60 - 299.28] P:1706.20 E:0.094049 |  far side again. The ball played deep into the England penalty area. Too deep, thankfully.
[299.28 - 302.68] P:1650.81 E:0.095447 |  It's over the crossbar and behind for the goal kick. But England haven't started well.
[302.68 - 306.44] P:1839.56 E:0.099780 |  It's just a little bit too easy for Costa Rica at the moment. England have got to get tighter.
[306.44 - 311.40] P:1675.25 E:0.092450 |  You've got to put pressure on the ball. The player who's got the ball under control, you've
[311.40 - 315.76] P:1766.30 E:0.094665 |  got to get close enough to get his head down. I'm sorry, but in this case, two or three
[315.76 - 320.08] P:1778.83 E:0.092617 |  yards isn't close enough. You've got to get within a yard of a player to affect him because
[320.08 - 324.20] P:1764.95 E:0.095361 |  players are better than they used to do. If you give a player two or three yards, as you
[324.28 - 328.52] P:1653.27 E:0.091238 |  see there, they can ping the ball all over the place. England, of course, have been far
[328.52 - 333.52] P:1655.35 E:0.097894 |  from good during this World Cup. But I do think that results have been worse than performance.
[333.52 - 338.12] P:1568.72 E:0.093261 |  Some things have just gone against them when they badly needed to go for them. Now they're
[338.12 - 343.24] P:1667.34 E:0.095651 |  on the attack in the far side of the field. It breaks down as Milner loses possession.
[343.24 - 350.12] P:1739.30 E:0.099733 |  It's drilled towards Ruiz. The captain, Ruiz Tackle, loses it to La Havana. La Havana,
[350.20 - 354.28] P:1821.79 E:0.096677 |  the other. Is that once you're done again?
[354.28 - 358.28] P:1822.45 E:0.094327 |  Yeah, he just got caught on a follow-through in the back. But this is the problem, I think,
[358.28 - 362.52] P:1761.54 E:0.100762 |  with Jack Wilshere. He goes down after nearly every single challenge.
[362.52 - 368.04] P:1926.19 E:0.106115 |  And he immediately looks hurt. He's holding, he's clutching the back of his right thigh
[368.04 - 372.36] P:1891.17 E:0.094955 |  at the moment. But he's out of the game at the moment, too. Six minutes gone here in
[372.36 - 373.36] P:1670.54 E:0.089705 |  Belo Horizonte.
[373.36 - 376.08] P:1777.00 E:0.090688 |  I know it's wrong, Alan, but is the sort of play you'd be thinking, you know what, if
[376.08 - 379.76] P:1710.65 E:0.097527 |  I get the chance, I'm going to get a decent Tackle in early on. You know, possibly leave
[379.80 - 382.84] P:1635.59 E:0.082727 |  a little bit on him, you know, and see how he reacts to that.
[382.84 - 388.48] P:1574.91 E:0.089078 |  Campbell takes the ball and then he gives it away. And Wilshere restored to health, we
[388.48 - 393.08] P:1605.27 E:0.094035 |  think, back to La Havana, deep inside his own half. La Havana switches it to the far
[393.08 - 396.88] P:1791.12 E:0.103290 |  side of the field. That was cut out of each of the backbears. And then one back-buying
[396.88 - 401.36] P:1800.76 E:0.099612 |  over the foot was a bit high, according to the Algerian referee. And it's a free kick
[401.36 - 402.36] P:1743.86 E:0.083972 |  to Costa Rica.
[402.36 - 408.32] P:1835.43 E:0.090868 |  Probably get away with that in the Premier League. Phil Jones just came in, studs showing.
[408.40 - 413.08] P:1798.36 E:0.086598 |  Both players went for the ball, but Diaz had his foot, his studs pointing downwards.
[413.08 - 417.24] P:1753.21 E:0.096728 |  Jones just started pointing up. And as we've all seen in European international football,
[417.24 - 419.24] P:1732.40 E:0.084732 |  that's always likely to be a free kick.
[419.24 - 423.88] P:1518.19 E:0.100624 |  Now, Campbell, the Arsenal player, is on loan to Olympiacus. He'll take the free kick. It's
[423.88 - 428.04] P:1643.80 E:0.099962 |  about 40 yards of mean and goal. Slightly to the left as he plays it in left footed,
[428.04 - 434.00] P:1789.39 E:0.094275 |  straight into the grateful hands of Ben Foster. And Foster throws it out to Shaw. Shaw surges
[434.08 - 438.84] P:1714.25 E:0.086605 |  towards the half way line. Chips it over the half way line. Barclay's there, the first
[438.84 - 443.08] P:1789.99 E:0.088491 |  touch from Barclay. Not great, but he flayed it off a Costa Rican player. And it's out
[443.08 - 449.84] P:1829.14 E:0.090125 |  of Diaz for a throw into England, deep inside the Costa Rican half. In the small sliver
[449.84 - 455.48] P:1698.42 E:0.083280 |  of shadow cast by the roof of this stadium, Shaw throws it back into the sunshine, back
[455.48 - 460.76] P:1712.39 E:0.091093 |  towards Smalling, just over the half way line. Smalling hits it to the far side to his Manchester
[460.76 - 465.88] P:1883.84 E:0.096505 |  United colleague, Jones Jones. Pass forward to Sturridge. It was awfully difficult for
[465.88 - 472.24] P:1843.35 E:0.081908 |  Sturridge to take, but he was fouled anyway by Roy Miller, and it's a free kick to England.
[472.24 - 473.24] P:1767.06 E:0.104414 |  Taken and played to Wilshire.
[473.24 - 478.40] P:1854.84 E:0.094082 |  So, it's fired in really hard into Sturridge's feet from Phil Jones. Almost had no chance
[478.40 - 481.92] P:1754.86 E:0.082877 |  to control that, and fortunate, I think, to get the free kick in the end.
[481.92 - 487.24] P:1895.50 E:0.090705 |  Here's Wilshire following the free kick, and that's a pass over hit. Welfare on Sturridge,
[487.24 - 493.20] P:1913.93 E:0.094842 |  and it's going through to Navas, the goalkeeper. He's one of a number of goalkeepers in this
[493.20 - 499.84] P:1740.51 E:0.081092 |  World Cup, Danny, that are unknown, basically, to a British audience at five-five. But this
[499.84 - 504.52] P:1781.40 E:0.089115 |  guy is looking for a new club. I gather he quite wants to play in England, and he is
[504.52 - 505.52] P:1888.52 E:0.093057 |  really good.
[505.52 - 512.72] P:1842.30 E:0.088375 |  I think there'll be lots of players from the so-called lesser nations, if you like, that
[512.72 - 516.76] P:1863.70 E:0.100007 |  we don't know too much about around the world. Those players put themselves in the shop window.
[516.76 - 520.28] P:1731.76 E:0.095648 |  It's always a little bit of a risk if you buy somebody off the back of a tournament,
[520.28 - 524.40] P:1802.72 E:0.096575 |  when it's only, you know, possibly two or three good games. But it's certainly an opportunity
[524.40 - 526.40] P:1689.02 E:0.074411 |  for them to be watched again.
[526.40 - 531.92] P:1724.18 E:0.091316 |  Ajaxia, a chore, rather. He plays for Ajaxia in France. He's another one of the Mexican
[531.92 - 538.08] P:1640.89 E:0.092507 |  goalkeeper who is looking for a move, and he's outstanding. Throw into Costa Rica, launch
[538.08 - 543.92] P:1591.36 E:0.096842 |  towards the half-way line, headed back by Loane, in by Lampard. Barclay heads into Wilshire,
[544.28 - 548.68] P:1656.46 E:0.093281 |  into Barclay again. His pass was aimed at Lampard. It was slightly overhead, but it's
[548.68 - 553.04] P:1561.11 E:0.096348 |  collected by Keahill. Keahill to Shaw. England settling down. Nine minutes gone, here in
[553.04 - 559.16] P:1604.03 E:0.098637 |  Bell Horizonte. Nil Nil, Costa Rica and England. Wilshire Tackle loses the ball. Costa Rica
[559.16 - 563.88] P:1560.01 E:0.089922 |  cleared upfield in the direction of Campbell, but it's ahead of the striker, and it's through
[563.88 - 569.88] P:1558.75 E:0.094030 |  to Ben Foster. He quickly finds, small, an on-bar Lampard to the near side of the England
[569.92 - 575.92] P:1564.33 E:0.092307 |  left, and Shaw. Shaw curls it inside, but that's behind Sturridge, headed away quite
[575.92 - 580.12] P:1632.37 E:0.101412 |  comfortably by Miller, but now it's back with Sturridge again, to the right of the penalty
[580.12 - 585.52] P:1579.89 E:0.100270 |  area. Not many white shirts in support. Sturridge has the ball, though, and moving inside towards
[585.52 - 589.52] P:1527.76 E:0.094578 |  the edge of the penalty area. Plays it to Wilshire, back to Lampard. Lampard couldn't
[589.52 - 594.40] P:1760.68 E:0.102708 |  get the ball under his feet. Loses possession, and Costa Rica counterattack, though they slow
[594.40 - 598.36] P:1550.05 E:0.094094 |  things down there. Just over the half-way line. The ball hit towards the near side of
[598.40 - 605.40] P:1633.22 E:0.093022 |  the field, towards Campbell. Campbell, no, in towards the penalty area. Was he fouled
[605.40 - 609.72] P:1720.74 E:0.103138 |  there? Play continues, and then the offside flag is raised, and a little unlucky there,
[609.72 - 614.84] P:1751.03 E:0.089823 |  Costa Rica not to get a free kick. Yeah, it was a really good move. Again, this time it
[614.84 - 620.24] P:1695.60 E:0.100381 |  was Luke Shaw. A little bit exposed down England's left-hand side, in a two-on-one situation.
[620.24 - 624.40] P:1755.89 E:0.099544 |  Joel Campbell decided to go inside. It was a great little one-two on the edge of the box,
[624.44 - 628.64] P:1681.54 E:0.098793 |  and England a little bit fortunate. I think it's a big game for Gary Cahill. He's really
[628.64 - 634.72] P:1702.45 E:0.099051 |  got to marshal that defence. That experience will do him well. He is now the senior member
[634.72 - 641.48] P:1655.85 E:0.096007 |  of that defence. It's 0-0 here in Valorazzonte. I'm assuming it's still 0-0 between Italy
[641.48 - 648.60] P:1590.59 E:0.089594 |  and Uruguay in the other game, and it is 0-0. The reason that's frankly of great importance,
[648.60 - 655.36] P:1614.23 E:0.092738 |  of course, is that if Italy get a draw or a win, then they will go through. Uruguay have
[655.36 - 660.80] P:1626.74 E:0.093367 |  to win the match. Conor McNamara is there. Yeah, still 0-0 between Italy and Uruguay,
[660.80 - 664.32] P:1704.99 E:0.092359 |  and the Italians knowing that this scoreline would see them through. Pat Nevin, they're
[664.32 - 667.92] P:1482.61 E:0.092101 |  parking about two buses on the edge of the penalty area. Yeah, it's a one that we haven't
[667.92 - 671.84] P:1448.99 E:0.095242 |  used to a great deal in this world cup so far, certainly, but the play, and it's a one to
[671.84 - 676.56] P:1590.14 E:0.097690 |  cynical. There's a lot of cynical throws out there, a very cynical looking game, particularly
[676.68 - 680.44] P:1759.35 E:0.088343 |  for the Italians, but let's be honest, the better than Uruguay as well. Yeah, Suarez
[680.44 - 685.32] P:1839.20 E:0.091690 |  has been kicked by Barzagli. Chiellini has been elbowed in the chest. It's a real fight
[685.32 - 691.84] P:1609.86 E:0.083680 |  here in Natal. It's Italy 0-0, Uruguay 0. It will be. Amazingly, some of the coverage
[691.84 - 695.80] P:1491.00 E:0.094388 |  here in Brazil is rather narrow minded. Of course, we've got a presence in Natal, but
[695.80 - 699.56] P:1556.36 E:0.098922 |  I would have assumed that one of the many pictures we have on our television sets would have
[699.56 - 705.36] P:1496.93 E:0.093622 |  shown us live coverage of Uruguay. In fact, Marc Pugac has got it. We haven't got it up
[705.36 - 710.08] P:1729.36 E:0.096271 |  here, Marc. Use an error, I think, Alan. This might be... Was it really? What a shape.
[710.08 - 714.12] P:1845.92 E:0.097392 |  Here's Wiltshire coming forward for England. The story, again, to the D. Oh, just wide.
[714.12 - 720.60] P:1897.48 E:0.082977 |  Left foot shot. Curled just wide of the far post. Again, individual brilliance from Daniel
[720.60 - 726.04] P:1862.18 E:0.091619 |  Sturridge. He's just had a glance up at the big screen, looking to the replay. See how
[726.04 - 731.24] P:1714.14 E:0.081874 |  far it was away. Stopped the ball. Instinctive shot with his left foot curling towards the
[731.24 - 737.32] P:1724.71 E:0.083719 |  far post, just drifted wide in the end. But so far, I'm not quite sure what style of play
[737.32 - 743.44] P:1654.76 E:0.082985 |  England are. You know, it's not really playing on the counter attack. It's not high tempo
[743.44 - 750.40] P:1760.90 E:0.088783 |  getting forward. It's not pass, pass, pass, pass. I want to see a bit more definition
[750.40 - 754.08] P:1621.37 E:0.099160 |  to their style. Quickly to the cricket. Pat Murphy at heading, Lee. We're waiting for a
[754.08 - 760.92] P:1765.47 E:0.088597 |  decision about Chris Jordan. He may well be out. He survived a TV review half an hour
[760.96 - 766.28] P:1621.59 E:0.086636 |  ago, but the original decision from the umpire, Steve Davis, is that he is out. The score
[766.28 - 772.40] P:1565.73 E:0.083961 |  is 212 for seven, and the overs are ticking by here now, and Jordan is out. He's been
[772.40 - 779.28] P:1721.29 E:0.088052 |  given out. It's now 212 for eight. There are 28 overs left, and Sri Lanka only need two
[779.28 - 785.72] P:1657.47 E:0.078805 |  more wickets. Thanks, Pat, whose voice like England are just about hanging on there. 13
[785.72 - 790.92] P:1650.95 E:0.081910 |  minutes gone here in Belarosa on day Costa Rica, Neil England, Nell just to confirm it
[790.92 - 797.36] P:1603.83 E:0.074917 |  still Italy, Neil Uruguay, Neil in the towel. Balls on the halfway line with Campbell for
[797.36 - 802.36] P:1661.90 E:0.085754 |  Costa Rica. The England fans, I gather, are singing always look on the bright side of
[802.36 - 807.04] P:1742.93 E:0.083702 |  life. Well, I think they've probably got over their disappointment now of those two games.
[807.04 - 811.88] P:1755.70 E:0.086915 |  I have to remember, you know, they are in Brazil. Fantastic place to be. You know, great
[811.96 - 818.12] P:1832.84 E:0.084581 |  food, great drink, great views all around the country. So I think, you know, they're just
[818.12 - 822.36] P:1641.67 E:0.085764 |  here now. They're going to enjoy what a little time left they have in Brazil. Danny Mills
[822.36 - 828.60] P:1741.59 E:0.095211 |  speaking from personal experience there. England not looking that good so far. You'd have seen
[828.60 - 835.60] P:1762.39 E:0.083901 |  it on your tally if you could get it working, Alan. It wasn't there earlier. That's enough
[835.60 - 841.84] P:1716.73 E:0.095007 |  said about that. Cahill de Smollin. I'm smalling to the left side and Sean, the halfway line
[841.84 - 846.60] P:1674.77 E:0.090093 |  Sean was caught there but his missed control didn't help him and then that's a weak pass
[846.60 - 852.20] P:1676.66 E:0.095989 |  forward by Wilshire and Costa Rica have possession again on the far side of the field with Diaz.
[852.20 - 860.20] P:1761.84 E:0.094884 |  He plays for Mines in the Bundesliga. A Mexican wave has broken out around the stadium and
[860.20 - 864.48] P:1641.10 E:0.094746 |  we haven't had a quarter of an hour of the game yet. And that's a crossfield ball hit
[864.48 - 869.72] P:1812.93 E:0.083850 |  by Costa Rica straight out of play. It's a throw in to England. Shaw's going to take
[869.72 - 875.64] P:1805.47 E:0.081485 |  it. Not a sniff of a goalbound effort yet. Apart from that shot from Sturridge that wasn't
[875.64 - 881.76] P:1806.31 E:0.085465 |  that far wide. Shaw to take the throw in. Twenty yards inside the Costa Rican half.
[881.76 - 886.40] P:1867.91 E:0.088942 |  He ignores Wilshire. Throws the Sturridge instead. Sturridge back to Shaw. Wilshire's available
[886.40 - 892.84] P:1794.78 E:0.084633 |  down the left side. Shaw moves in field. Naively loses possession and it's with Bran Ruiz.
[892.84 - 899.08] P:1777.29 E:0.080248 |  Bran Ruiz glides into the far side. Campbell controls it. Campbell now looking for Diaz.
[899.44 - 904.72] P:1748.24 E:0.085888 |  Now he finds Diaz on the far touch line. That's the Costa Rican left in field it goes.
[904.72 - 910.24] P:1755.12 E:0.088005 |  Then Diaz wants more. Back to Roy Miller and Miller finds Gonzalez one of the three central
[910.24 - 915.48] P:1694.18 E:0.080272 |  defenders. He's another of them now. Duarte who plays for Club Bruges. Back to Gonzalez
[915.48 - 920.56] P:1805.03 E:0.085334 |  who plays in the MLS for Columbus crew. Switches play toward the far side of the field. Well
[920.56 - 924.84] P:1735.67 E:0.083662 |  anticipated by Jones. He heads it out and it's going to be a throw in to Costa Rica just
[924.92 - 930.40] P:1652.03 E:0.091957 |  beyond the halfway line. Nil Nil here. Still Nil Nil in the towel between Italy and Uruguay.
[930.40 - 938.60] P:1676.80 E:0.099018 |  And let's go to Ian Dennis on the touch line. It might be a dead rubber but England's support
[938.60 - 942.92] P:1518.06 E:0.099024 |  here sitting pitch side for five live is fantastic. They have had a rendition of always look on
[942.92 - 947.48] P:1428.40 E:0.093306 |  the bright side of life. Instead of footballs coming home England's going home but they're
[947.48 - 951.36] P:1428.17 E:0.092408 |  not very popular with the rest of the fans inside this stadium because they're refusing
[951.40 - 962.48] P:1643.19 E:0.090491 |  to take part in the Mexican way. As I would. They're absolutely right. Ruiz for Costa Rica.
[962.48 - 968.12] P:1902.69 E:0.090693 |  Exchanges passes with Takeda and now Campbell loses it for Costa Rica. It's not a great
[968.12 - 972.76] P:1825.62 E:0.085277 |  game of football this. Now there was that pass out of the England defence by Smalling
[972.76 - 978.16] P:1675.17 E:0.074092 |  straight out of play on the far side of the field. Costa Rican throw in. Costa Rica.
[978.16 - 983.52] P:1747.22 E:0.086933 |  Arguerite just slightly the better side at the moment. Here's Duarte and it's quickly
[983.52 - 989.20] P:1752.29 E:0.084471 |  flicked on by Borges and it's run over the halfway line now down the near side of the
[989.20 - 994.64] P:1737.41 E:0.077425 |  field with Campbell for Costa Rica. Campbell still not considered good enough to be playing
[994.64 - 999.92] P:1760.34 E:0.087181 |  for Arsenal. He is on the Arsenal books back to Brown Ruiz who scored that winning goal
[999.92 - 1004.80] P:1720.51 E:0.081344 |  against Italy. His pass forward not great. Lampard clears it. Lallana still inside his
[1004.80 - 1009.32] P:1867.60 E:0.088059 |  own half. The Sturridge in the centre circle. Sturridge was surely followed that he was
[1009.32 - 1013.60] P:1737.37 E:0.086104 |  at the second attempt by Roy Miller and it's a free kick awarded by the Algerian referee.
[1013.60 - 1018.88] P:1787.10 E:0.078793 |  It's a little bit disjointed at the moment in terms of the England play. Again a little
[1018.88 - 1022.84] P:1809.64 E:0.088847 |  bit understandable. All these players haven't played an awful lot together. My biggest concern
[1022.84 - 1027.44] P:1790.83 E:0.086581 |  I'd be interested and we'll see what Chris Waddle thinks. We've talked about philosophy.
[1027.44 - 1031.88] P:1790.97 E:0.088926 |  How England are playing going forward. We talked about identity. I don't think England
[1031.88 - 1035.76] P:1778.27 E:0.094659 |  have either at the moment. I don't know what the philosophy of the style of players and
[1035.76 - 1040.88] P:1789.73 E:0.093447 |  I don't want our identity. Once upon a time England, strong defensively, difficult to
[1040.88 - 1046.64] P:1756.37 E:0.092824 |  beat will work really, really hard, good from set pieces. Now I look at this team and I
[1046.64 - 1050.72] P:1723.75 E:0.099536 |  don't know what England is. I don't know what we are going to, what style of play we're
[1050.72 - 1054.68] P:1845.22 E:0.094523 |  supposed to be playing. Is that Hodgson's fault? I'm not sure whose fault it is. I don't know
[1054.68 - 1059.88] P:1870.79 E:0.088942 |  whether it's part of Hodgson, part of the players, part of the bigger picture. That's
[1059.88 - 1061.88] P:1954.61 E:0.102198 |  what we need to solve. Here's Sturridge, left foot folly just
[1061.88 - 1067.36] P:1834.47 E:0.087161 |  tipping over the crossbar. Didn't get down quickly enough, but at least twice now Sturridge
[1067.36 - 1071.80] P:1807.29 E:0.085042 |  has been looking at goal. Well the two half chances that Sturridge have had have been moments
[1071.80 - 1076.56] P:1840.87 E:0.081606 |  that he's created himself. He's got the ball, he's done a little step over, a little skill
[1076.56 - 1080.80] P:1808.04 E:0.094068 |  and he's had a shot. It's not like we are creating chances by good build up play or
[1080.80 - 1085.24] P:1797.54 E:0.093571 |  we get the ball wide. We get the ball into the box as you know when Shearer once played.
[1085.24 - 1089.48] P:1650.48 E:0.085016 |  Waddle was on the wing. That's what it was all about. I'm just looking at England at
[1089.48 - 1096.60] P:1731.20 E:0.078320 |  the moment and it's just an OK game of football. There's no real purpose about anything. Campbell
[1096.60 - 1101.52] P:1687.90 E:0.093100 |  back to the halfway line and then it swung towards the far side of the field by Decada
[1101.52 - 1106.16] P:1694.96 E:0.089768 |  headed on initially by Dears, but cleared by England high over the halfway line. Only
[1106.16 - 1109.80] P:1687.01 E:0.091269 |  Sturridge is up there. I mean look, there's not an England player within 40 yards of Daniel
[1109.80 - 1114.36] P:1797.59 E:0.086787 |  Sturridge. I thought we were down to play 4-3-3 today. That was certainly the suggestion made
[1114.36 - 1118.88] P:1758.42 E:0.086237 |  by Roy Hodgson. Haven't seen much evidence of it yet. But England have been throwing
[1118.88 - 1126.00] P:1767.69 E:0.075445 |  on the far side of the field, level with the edge of the Costa Rican penalty area. Sturridge
[1126.00 - 1130.00] P:1752.05 E:0.091307 |  needs rather more support than he's getting. It's one thing tightening up the midfield.
[1130.00 - 1135.16] P:1912.60 E:0.095150 |  Well it's a 4-4-1-1 and Barclays almost drifted into that midfield area at times and making
[1135.16 - 1140.20] P:1903.60 E:0.089391 |  it a 4-5-1 if you like. I mean he needs to get a little bit closer to Daniel Sturridge
[1140.20 - 1145.40] P:1760.19 E:0.085486 |  and give him some support. Lots of white shirts inside the Costa Rican half at the moment.
[1145.44 - 1150.04] P:1815.51 E:0.094116 |  Here's Sean, 19 minutes gone. Nil-nil here in Belo Horizonte to Frank Lampard, edge of
[1150.04 - 1154.64] P:1859.69 E:0.087511 |  the D. Lampard to Sturridge. Sturridge tries to back heal the ball to Lampard again. Only
[1154.64 - 1159.68] P:1833.50 E:0.082602 |  he met by a defender though and cleared up towards Campbell. It's out of play off Campbell
[1159.68 - 1165.64] P:1797.41 E:0.075465 |  and it will be a throw in to England. You're listening to 5 Live Your World Cup Station
[1165.64 - 1173.76] P:1795.31 E:0.079757 |  on the BBC. Brazil 2014. England finished today. We don't finish. It's with Gary Kaer,
[1174.12 - 1179.64] P:1702.97 E:0.089797 |  just two players retained by Roy Hudson in the starting 11 from the side that lost to
[1179.64 - 1188.04] P:1886.44 E:0.081896 |  Uruguay. Back it goes to Ben Foster. I wonder when Foster come on as a substitute sometime
[1188.04 - 1193.48] P:1715.98 E:0.089866 |  in the second half, not at half time. Selfie goalkeeper. Now Milner on the far side, turns
[1193.48 - 1196.92] P:1821.79 E:0.097883 |  away well from the marker, feeds it through towards Sturridge. Final touch back by the
[1196.92 - 1203.36] P:1750.30 E:0.087939 |  defender. Not seen as an intended back pass so the goalkeeper can grab the ball with both
[1203.44 - 1213.00] P:1673.29 E:0.076776 |  hands. 20 minutes gone. Costa Rica nil, England nil. It's still nil nil in Natal. England
[1213.00 - 1218.80] P:1744.40 E:0.088066 |  haven't really built up a purposeful attack yet, have they? It really is just Costa Rica
[1218.80 - 1224.88] P:1710.51 E:0.088746 |  give the ball away or Sturridge gets it, turns and shoots. There's been no buildup of play,
[1224.88 - 1230.84] P:1685.72 E:0.089659 |  no sort of momentum gathering from England. It's really been, I think Costa Rica, dictating
[1231.32 - 1236.00] P:1599.37 E:0.091564 |  the style and the tempo of play at the moment. And Connor McNamara will just confirm that
[1236.00 - 1241.00] P:1722.92 E:0.093730 |  it's nil nil in Natal. Yes, Alan still scoreless here between Italy and Uruguay. An exciting
[1241.00 - 1244.88] P:1856.54 E:0.094582 |  game though, so much at stake for both sides. Perlos had a shot from distance. It caused
[1244.88 - 1248.44] P:1690.71 E:0.083670 |  more trouble for the Uruguay goalkeeper than it should have done. He fumbled it over for
[1248.44 - 1254.48] P:1755.82 E:0.084265 |  a corner. It's Italy nil Uruguay nil. Now Costa Rica have a free kick. It was a pushover
[1254.48 - 1259.44] P:1674.85 E:0.084503 |  by Frank Lampard, the captain today in the absence of Stephen Gerard. Gerard of course
[1259.56 - 1264.96] P:1658.95 E:0.086590 |  available on the bench at the moment. He's stuck on 113 caps for England. That's two
[1264.96 - 1273.56] P:1633.05 E:0.080603 |  behind the outfield recall held by David Beckham. Costa Rica, chipped the ball over the
[1273.56 - 1279.80] P:1697.01 E:0.088354 |  half way line, running towards Brenes but not controlled by him. Half cleared by England
[1279.80 - 1284.76] P:1751.17 E:0.078395 |  then that looked like a push and it was a push and it's going to be a free kick to England.
[1284.92 - 1289.76] P:1734.22 E:0.089845 |  Now he's back in and played to Milner. Milner goes back to Jones and then into Cahill, onto
[1289.76 - 1295.56] P:1739.31 E:0.086120 |  Smalling. Wiltshire available. Wiltshire not really forward enough for my liking. Now he's
[1295.56 - 1300.68] P:1700.01 E:0.091952 |  here from LaLana's pass. Wiltshire into the Costa Rican half. Shaw into LaLana couldn't
[1300.68 - 1306.68] P:1754.17 E:0.089874 |  control it and Costa Rica have it. Brenes in the centre circle. Red shirts congregated
[1306.68 - 1310.76] P:1670.07 E:0.089472 |  around that centre circle but there's another one towards this near side. That's Gamboa,
[1310.76 - 1319.48] P:1715.27 E:0.077998 |  right wing back, onto Gamboa, back to Gamboa and into Decada. Ruiz, the captain, good touch
[1319.48 - 1324.92] P:1869.92 E:0.094437 |  by Gamboa. Plays a one-two, Gamboa goes forward, falls over because he was stripped and it's
[1324.92 - 1329.80] P:1903.60 E:0.097599 |  a free kick to Costa Rica. And that's the difference I think between the two sides. Costa Rica playing
[1329.80 - 1334.88] P:1800.02 E:0.091592 |  with confidence. Quite happy to be patient. Keep the ball in the middle of the park, keep
[1334.88 - 1340.28] P:1829.71 E:0.090773 |  it moving, one, two, touch and just wait for opportunities. When they see a gap they burst
[1340.32 - 1346.20] P:1789.76 E:0.089678 |  into it and because of that they've now got a free kick, probably 25, 30 yards from goal.
[1346.20 - 1350.64] P:1723.69 E:0.081641 |  Well, it would have been a fantastic stride from that distance I think to test the goalkeeper.
[1350.64 - 1354.76] P:1704.49 E:0.093061 |  By the way, Balotelli, of Italy, has just been booked in the match in the towel and he will
[1354.76 - 1362.08] P:1756.80 E:0.086345 |  miss the game in the last 16, should Italy qualify. I wish that chance still lingered
[1362.08 - 1368.48] P:1753.22 E:0.085483 |  for England. Meantime, it's a free kick to Costa Rica. It's a goal-threatening distance.
[1368.52 - 1373.40] P:1666.00 E:0.096121 |  It's a round about 25 yards, maybe a fraction more. Here comes the shot right footed up
[1373.40 - 1378.40] P:1816.37 E:0.100183 |  and goodness, and either hit the top of the crossbar or the save by Foster. It's gone
[1378.40 - 1383.72] P:1808.31 E:0.091280 |  behind either way. It's going to be a corner to Costa Rica and we're past the mid-repoint
[1383.72 - 1386.04] P:1701.90 E:0.088069 |  in the first half. Here's Mike Ingram and Neil Neal.
[1386.04 - 1389.28] P:1911.02 E:0.099226 |  I think, sorry Mike, I think Ben Foster might have just got a touch on this, just trying
[1389.28 - 1393.72] P:1881.18 E:0.091106 |  to see the replay again as it comes in. He did just touch it onto the bar. I think it
[1393.72 - 1398.08] P:1769.18 E:0.086726 |  probably would have hit the bar anyhow and now there's a corner but a great save. Well,
[1398.12 - 1401.80] P:1895.11 E:0.094581 |  the referee initially appeared to give a goal kick and then had a little think. It's a corner
[1401.80 - 1406.76] P:1777.73 E:0.096207 |  kick to Costa Rica. It's Neal Neal here against England. The corner kick over on the far side
[1406.76 - 1412.20] P:1854.10 E:0.098877 |  and Lampard scuffs it away and Barclay comes on a break and is immediately caught in possession.
[1412.20 - 1415.36] P:2024.59 E:0.096299 |  Campbell now moving forward for Costa Rica. There's danger on the edge of the England
[1415.36 - 1419.88] P:1911.21 E:0.092614 |  penalty area. Ruiz finding Campbell. Some of the defenders have stayed forward following
[1419.88 - 1424.64] P:1909.95 E:0.093951 |  that corner and they've got another one. That was a prime example of Barclay being young
[1424.72 - 1429.76] P:1951.81 E:0.086500 |  and naive and making the wrong decision. England were looking to counterattack and he tried to
[1429.76 - 1435.48] P:1908.84 E:0.088497 |  beat a player. He just knocked it into him. Didn't do a trick, didn't move the ball sideways.
[1435.48 - 1440.20] P:1789.82 E:0.083534 |  It should have passed it and then moved and gone around the player that way. Another corner
[1440.20 - 1445.24] P:1833.24 E:0.100763 |  to Costa Rica over on the far side and Foster comes for it and hulls onto it very well but
[1445.24 - 1448.76] P:1800.07 E:0.090940 |  there's nobody to give it to. That's exactly what Roy Hutchins was talking about earlier
[1448.76 - 1453.64] P:1702.10 E:0.086521 |  in the tournament about Ross Barclay. It's an awkward game for Costa Rica in a sense
[1453.64 - 1458.60] P:1686.76 E:0.085952 |  and that they don't obviously want to get any yellow cards so they can't be over vigorous.
[1458.60 - 1462.72] P:1646.45 E:0.089305 |  Mark Pugatch has already mentioned that they get the draw, they'll win the group. So they're
[1462.72 - 1466.88] P:1750.29 E:0.090778 |  playing sometimes within themselves as well. But the biggest skill in football, Mike, is
[1466.88 - 1470.96] P:1773.12 E:0.087229 |  making the right decision. You ask any of those players down there under no pressure,
[1470.96 - 1475.24] P:1800.55 E:0.092386 |  yes, they can all pass it five yards, 50 yards, 60 yards, they can all shoot at goal. They
[1475.24 - 1480.08] P:1807.75 E:0.092258 |  can do all of those things but the skill is making the right decision at the right time
[1480.08 - 1483.80] P:1779.86 E:0.096177 |  and when you're young, sometimes you make the wrong ones. Lampard has hoisted a very
[1483.80 - 1488.04] P:1834.84 E:0.104042 |  good ball over the top and there's a mistake here inside the penalty area which almost
[1488.04 - 1492.16] P:1916.10 E:0.091324 |  led in Jack Wilshire. Costa Rica in the shadow of the stand looking to clear down the sneer
[1492.16 - 1498.92] P:1767.06 E:0.082002 |  side and that ball has eventually gone out of play. We're in sunny Bella Horizonte and
[1498.92 - 1504.12] P:1682.23 E:0.090736 |  it's nil nil between Costa Rica and England. It's nil nil between Italy and Uruguay and
[1504.12 - 1508.56] P:1648.45 E:0.089225 |  the score lines stay like this. Then Costa Rica win the group and Italy would finish
[1508.56 - 1514.00] P:1648.98 E:0.086697 |  second but still an awful long way to go on five-live. England all in white today led
[1514.00 - 1520.20] P:1720.65 E:0.090893 |  by Frank Lampard equaling Sir Bobby Charlton's 106 caps. He loved to score today to get his
[1520.20 - 1525.20] P:1684.54 E:0.092486 |  30th goal for England and the free kick is almost a mess there by England. Now it's played
[1525.20 - 1530.12] P:1708.41 E:0.094348 |  down the right hand side towards Phil Jones. Jones gets support from Daniel Sturridge.
[1530.12 - 1534.12] P:1683.42 E:0.094560 |  The Larners made a run into the penalty area. Sturridge has given the ball away and Brennes
[1534.12 - 1539.16] P:1728.58 E:0.089372 |  now for Costa Rica up to Campbell back again to Brennes and that's a bit short towards
[1539.16 - 1543.80] P:1791.44 E:0.098814 |  Ruiz but it's a great flick to find Campbell. Smoaning just backs off and then smalning
[1543.80 - 1548.96] P:1690.36 E:0.085966 |  will tidy up for England and he'll remember of course Campbell playing for Olympia Arcos
[1548.96 - 1552.72] P:1751.28 E:0.094882 |  in the Champions League against Manchester United this season. Ball into the Costa Rica
[1552.72 - 1556.32] P:1771.10 E:0.097572 |  half and Llanana now has gone into the centre. Wasn't getting much of the ball at all down
[1556.32 - 1562.52] P:1713.81 E:0.083044 |  this left hand side and England building although now it's Lampard looking forward in hope really
[1562.52 - 1566.44] P:1673.65 E:0.090069 |  towards Sturridge out comes the goalkeeper now. I was very interested in what you were
[1566.44 - 1570.12] P:1670.99 E:0.090392 |  saying Danny about the identity because it just seems to me now that England seem to
[1570.12 - 1573.28] P:1710.42 E:0.096885 |  be caught between two or three stills. They've almost forgotten what they're good at and
[1573.28 - 1576.52] P:1732.07 E:0.097622 |  they're trying to be other teams. Well they just got out there and they just sort of passed
[1576.52 - 1581.68] P:1590.39 E:0.092278 |  the ball around. No real direction. No real purpose. They think England are going to score
[1581.68 - 1586.32] P:1609.74 E:0.086864 |  at the moment. It's going to be a moment of individual brilliance from Daniel Sturridge
[1586.32 - 1591.48] P:1681.84 E:0.091341 |  or it's going to be a catastrophic mistake from Costa Rican. That's it. Costa Rican have
[1591.60 - 1595.32] P:1728.58 E:0.095784 |  given the ball away and Daniel Sturridge has the ball with Barclay to the right hand side.
[1595.32 - 1598.24] P:1760.40 E:0.099044 |  Wolches made a run in the area. Barclay is getting a little bit tangled up here on the
[1598.24 - 1602.56] P:1834.69 E:0.095463 |  edge of the area but he's riding the challenges. Good play from Barclay. Now he slots it up
[1602.56 - 1606.92] P:1805.79 E:0.090543 |  for James Milner. This ball should come into the penalty area for England. Milner scoops
[1606.92 - 1612.56] P:1901.49 E:0.102516 |  the ball in headed down to Sturridge. Sturridge has a chance and look he thinks he was brought
[1612.56 - 1616.88] P:1825.02 E:0.096863 |  down some seven yards out. He's looking at the referee but there's nothing for England
[1616.88 - 1621.04] P:1814.27 E:0.084197 |  there and England should have scored. They shouldn't have been looking for the penalty
[1621.08 - 1624.16] P:1720.06 E:0.092970 |  without looking at the replay. I'm going to say that's good defending. The cross was
[1624.16 - 1629.20] P:1792.20 E:0.092713 |  a little bit slow to come in and then there's two Costa Ricans challenge each other. It
[1629.20 - 1635.76] P:1777.05 E:0.084469 |  dropped to Sturridge and as he came in, it's Duarte just got his body in. Just did enough
[1635.76 - 1639.84] P:1723.86 E:0.089096 |  to put off Sturridge. Got his body in between Sturridge and the ball. That's good defending.
[1639.84 - 1644.08] P:1699.12 E:0.086111 |  You know, brave in that situation. If he's given away a penalty, you know, Daniel Sturridge
[1644.08 - 1647.64] P:1708.88 E:0.078871 |  has got to be a little bit sharper, a little bit quicker, get his shot away.
[1647.68 - 1651.24] P:1855.60 E:0.094630 |  Danny Mills with us and five live nil-nil between Costa Rica and England. Here comes
[1651.24 - 1655.88] P:1724.67 E:0.095426 |  the captain of Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz. He's been tackled by Lampard and now Barclay picks
[1655.88 - 1659.76] P:1774.99 E:0.098855 |  up possession and knocks it really long to the side and Sturridge will have to give up
[1659.76 - 1664.76] P:1858.61 E:0.087322 |  on that one. The intent was right but the delivery wasn't and Costa Rica. By the way,
[1664.76 - 1669.04] P:1766.47 E:0.087891 |  had an appalling build up coming into this world. They really didn't do well at all
[1669.04 - 1673.92] P:1667.91 E:0.080973 |  in their friendly matches but they've found themselves in a group with three former world
[1673.92 - 1679.44] P:1601.02 E:0.082282 |  champions. They've beaten two of them already. Italy and Uruguay. Now they're trying to make
[1679.44 - 1684.72] P:1613.76 E:0.080722 |  it a hat trick here today. Throw in to Costa Rica who plays three at the back and they
[1684.72 - 1690.08] P:1676.13 E:0.088884 |  have the wing backs. One of two teams doing that. It's well cut. Chile also playing with
[1690.08 - 1696.84] P:1595.29 E:0.084310 |  three central defenders and Chile are through to play Brazil in the last 16. Borla is back
[1696.84 - 1703.16] P:1574.33 E:0.072814 |  in the England half and Cahill now finds Lampard. Nil-nil. Back again to Cahill. England haven't
[1703.16 - 1709.00] P:1609.35 E:0.089463 |  created very much. They've swapped over now. They have it. Yes, they have swapped over
[1709.00 - 1713.36] P:1690.06 E:0.097854 |  Milner and Lallana just for the moment. Milner's playing down this near side, the left. Lallana
[1713.36 - 1716.56] P:1701.05 E:0.095895 |  over on the right. It's still quite a disjointed game though, Danny, isn't it? There's not
[1716.56 - 1721.40] P:1689.83 E:0.089596 |  much flow about it. No, it's all. Costa Rica really dictating it. They're happy for a
[1721.40 - 1727.28] P:1642.44 E:0.081432 |  slow paced game just to keep the ball. But England just haven't troubled their defensive
[1727.28 - 1734.00] P:1468.68 E:0.088726 |  tool. I'm surprised at that. These young players, this is a great opportunity for some of those
[1734.00 - 1737.80] P:1667.41 E:0.095178 |  young players to go out and really put down a marker and say, look, one I should have
[1737.80 - 1743.00] P:1545.05 E:0.086865 |  been in the start in 11, in the first two games. Or moving forward, I'm part of the
[1743.00 - 1747.12] P:1524.41 E:0.095373 |  Zinglin team. I want to play in this side. I want to go to the Euros. I want to go to
[1747.12 - 1751.60] P:1590.73 E:0.083593 |  the next World Cup. Yeah, because those Euro qualifying games will come around very, very
[1751.60 - 1756.48] P:1662.89 E:0.088510 |  quickly. Longboard out of the Costa Rican defence by Diaz over on the far side. It's
[1756.60 - 1761.28] P:1716.38 E:0.090236 |  Brenes against Jones and the Manchester United player heads the ball out for a Costa Rica
[1761.28 - 1768.44] P:1569.48 E:0.076771 |  throwing nil nil here in the horizontal Costa Rica throw the ball back. It's Diaz, the
[1768.44 - 1773.00] P:1535.11 E:0.089043 |  left wing back into midfield Costa Rica now playing the ball into feet lovely little flick
[1773.00 - 1777.92] P:1638.96 E:0.092975 |  from Ruiz. But this time England managed to get hold of it. Milner sets off down this
[1777.92 - 1782.08] P:1596.82 E:0.094379 |  near side. Someone needs to help him, though. He's running with the ball and there's nobody
[1782.08 - 1785.44] P:1724.20 E:0.096160 |  offering themselves ready. Jack Wall should goes past the first challenge, wins the free
[1785.48 - 1788.80] P:1757.65 E:0.092586 |  kick. He wasn't really going anywhere there. Jack Walsh is so he's done well to win the
[1788.80 - 1792.04] P:1726.43 E:0.090198 |  free kick. That's a really good point. You've just picked up and Mike when England players
[1792.04 - 1796.24] P:1664.70 E:0.086680 |  get the ball, they've got one option is only one player that really wants it. They only
[1796.24 - 1800.88] P:1623.21 E:0.085572 |  got one player to pass to you need three or four options. You know if you're going to
[1800.88 - 1805.48] P:1654.73 E:0.083393 |  play well and keep the ball moving very, very quickly, free kick has touched off short
[1805.48 - 1810.36] P:1712.99 E:0.088842 |  and it's down this left hand side with Luke Shaw. Shaw a very strong challenge coming
[1810.36 - 1814.28] P:1709.92 E:0.089820 |  in from Gamboa. The right back England still pressing lampards doing well here has to be
[1814.32 - 1820.28] P:1749.61 E:0.084395 |  careful to do it legally and now Shaw gives the ball away and the goalkeeper came out
[1820.28 - 1824.68] P:1689.58 E:0.086391 |  with a defender ignored him and now hammers the ball towards Ruiz who can't control it
[1824.68 - 1828.88] P:1632.04 E:0.095789 |  on the halfway line. But now he has a second opportunity. Barkley tangles with Ruiz. But
[1828.88 - 1833.00] P:1720.99 E:0.105753 |  so fantastic skill on the ball from Brian Ruiz turning brilliantly away from England
[1833.00 - 1837.96] P:1785.01 E:0.090382 |  players. Ball played into the centre and now it's offside against Brennness. The pass was
[1837.96 - 1842.32] P:1819.15 E:0.088128 |  just delayed as England just nudged forward out of defence and it's a free kick to England.
[1842.36 - 1846.84] P:1660.85 E:0.086432 |  Bill Nill. Brilliant bit of skill from Brian Ruiz to get away from Wilshire initially.
[1846.84 - 1853.64] P:1563.68 E:0.081169 |  Well, Maradona spin. It was called in in my day but superb. But England at the moment
[1853.64 - 1858.92] P:1716.03 E:0.082679 |  need to start playing with a higher tempo. But that is the biggest problem. Every time
[1858.92 - 1863.52] P:1655.09 E:0.083197 |  that Kav Gauz got the ball now, he's got one option and he's had to go back to the goalkeeper.
[1863.52 - 1867.88] P:1688.72 E:0.082956 |  England have got to work harder when they've got possession. He's got to be tactically
[1867.92 - 1872.92] P:1591.15 E:0.081416 |  more aware. Get themselves in a position to receive the ball. Brian Ruiz, of course,
[1872.92 - 1877.16] P:1598.99 E:0.095895 |  sent out on loan by Fulham to PSV in the way that Campbell was by Arsenal to Olympiakos.
[1877.16 - 1880.84] P:1762.20 E:0.088969 |  We're just going to watch Milner give chase towards the corner flag and now we'll hear
[1880.84 - 1886.28] P:1640.84 E:0.092387 |  more news of that Uruguay-Italy game from Conor McNamara. Still Italy-Nill, Uruguay-Nill.
[1886.28 - 1891.16] P:1725.02 E:0.094338 |  A draw good enough for Italy, remember. Uruguay need a win to be sure. It's tense and it's
[1891.16 - 1895.76] P:1830.03 E:0.094637 |  physical here and Ballatelli's booking means he'll be suspended for the second round. Should
[1896.12 - 1900.20] P:1699.13 E:0.087366 |  Italy get there? Uruguay looking dangerous on the break with Suarez, but Pat Nevin alongside
[1900.20 - 1903.76] P:1856.31 E:0.091010 |  Italy are organised to the back with their three central defenders. They are. They're
[1903.76 - 1906.52] P:1522.57 E:0.090083 |  going to be really hard to break down, but the best thing that's happened for me in the
[1906.52 - 1911.64] P:1643.81 E:0.085083 |  last 10-15 minutes, feel like a quarterback has dropped into the pocket and is zipping
[1911.64 - 1916.00] P:1612.60 E:0.086445 |  the ball about all over the place. He is controlling this game. A draw. Nill-Nill will
[1916.00 - 1921.48] P:1644.40 E:0.084227 |  be good enough for Italy. Uruguay have to win to be sure. Italy-Nill, Uruguay-Nill. Thank
[1921.48 - 1925.00] P:1791.15 E:0.087651 |  you. Nill-Nill is also good enough here for Costa Rica to win the group and that's the
[1925.04 - 1929.04] P:1688.48 E:0.087299 |  scoreline here as Lampard hits a long ball forward and that's lovely running from Adam
[1929.04 - 1934.04] P:1757.12 E:0.091336 |  Lallana towards the corner flag over on the far side. In comes the cross. It takes a deflection
[1934.04 - 1939.40] P:1742.41 E:0.090877 |  and England have a rare corner. Corner kick to England with 32 minutes gone in the first
[1939.40 - 1945.40] P:1547.37 E:0.079550 |  half here in Bellar Horizonte. And now let's see. A lot of England set pieces in the previous
[1945.40 - 1949.04] P:1632.86 E:0.084866 |  two games were very disappointing. Can they do something here down? That's really been
[1949.04 - 1953.76] P:1596.74 E:0.090236 |  down to delivery, which surprised even Gerrard's delivery wasn't as good as it normally was.
[1954.52 - 1960.92] P:1633.91 E:0.083916 |  You know, set pieces are all about the ball in. It doesn't matter how tall your players
[1960.92 - 1965.36] P:1609.49 E:0.075304 |  are, how good they are in the air. If the delivery is not right, it's a complete waste.
[1965.36 - 1968.64] P:1697.43 E:0.093013 |  Well, Barkley thought the corner was down this left hand side but he's been made to
[1968.64 - 1975.00] P:1746.63 E:0.086401 |  go across to the right into the sunshine over on the far side and England's central defenders
[1975.00 - 1982.00] P:1734.30 E:0.077232 |  are all in the penalty area, away to our left. Cahill, Smalling and Jones. That was a very
[1984.72 - 1988.48] P:1627.51 E:0.100459 |  false alarm from Barkley. He seemed to shape up to take the corner then ran over the ball.
[1988.48 - 1991.84] P:1673.43 E:0.095369 |  Yes, the lines were just stepped in front of him. It was Cahill and Duarte at the far post.
[1991.84 - 1996.08] P:1719.25 E:0.077403 |  She's having a little bit of a coming together. Corner kick to England. Nill Mill against Costa
[1996.08 - 2001.76] P:1660.23 E:0.087572 |  Rica in this final game for them in the World Cup. Barkley raises both arms and then the ball
[2001.76 - 2006.24] P:1733.35 E:0.085577 |  balloons off the defender who I'm not sure he was 10 yards, but it's gone behind for another
[2006.24 - 2009.28] P:1679.62 E:0.090082 |  corner kick and we get a replacement ball immediately. But this is what I'm talking
[2009.28 - 2011.76] P:1659.92 E:0.084769 |  about, Mike. You know, Barkley's got the corner. You know, this is something that you
[2011.84 - 2015.92] P:1623.17 E:0.085053 |  practice. You're delivering from set pieces and he's hit a player 10 yards in front of him.
[2015.92 - 2021.04] P:1739.22 E:0.089299 |  Well, Sturridge is being manhandled at the moment inside the six yard area as the corner kick
[2021.04 - 2026.00] P:1830.18 E:0.089238 |  is delivered. It was almost an opportunity for Gary Cahill who came diving in and sent him
[2026.00 - 2030.40] P:1754.41 E:0.086751 |  out of panic at the back there from Costa Rica. They've forced the ball behind for another corner
[2030.40 - 2035.60] P:1648.52 E:0.085510 |  and now Barkley has come to the right side of the stadium to take this corner and England still
[2035.60 - 2042.56] P:1706.46 E:0.080051 |  have an opportunity here with Cahill causing a few problems in the penalty area, smalling in Jones
[2042.56 - 2050.48] P:1602.62 E:0.079114 |  as well. So Ross Barkley starting a World Cup game here in Belo Horizonte with this England corner.
[2050.48 - 2058.32] P:1675.29 E:0.082420 |  Nill Mill against Costa Rica. Sturridge is still being lent on by one of the Costa
[2058.32 - 2062.08] P:1789.98 E:0.092099 |  Rican defenders as the corner kick is lifted very high to the far post headed down and then
[2062.16 - 2068.08] P:1775.48 E:0.088096 |  headed over by Daniel Sturridge in the end. Well, they had three corners there, England.
[2068.08 - 2072.80] P:1745.31 E:0.082081 |  They couldn't force it home and Sturridge couldn't control his header and put it down.
[2073.36 - 2076.48] P:1714.23 E:0.086571 |  It's gone behind. Let's go to David Law at Wimbledon.
[2076.48 - 2081.68] P:1461.32 E:0.096067 |  Rafael Nadal is a relieved man because although he lost the first set 6-4 against Martin Cleeson,
[2081.68 - 2086.24] P:1587.54 E:0.097215 |  he's come back to win the next three by the scoreline of 6-3 and now faces another clash
[2086.24 - 2089.76] P:1549.51 E:0.096952 |  against Lucas Rossell, the man who knocked him out in the second round two years ago.
[2090.00 - 2096.16] P:1720.77 E:0.084690 |  Thank you very much. We're four hours behind you here in Belo Horizonte. We're coming towards
[2096.16 - 2100.56] P:1788.94 E:0.088982 |  the final stages of the first half. 10 minutes to go. England Nill, Costa Rica Nill. It's still
[2100.56 - 2105.76] P:1678.95 E:0.085993 |  Uruguay Nill, Italy Nill. So with these scorelines at the moment, Costa Rica would win the group
[2105.76 - 2111.52] P:1685.58 E:0.082671 |  with Italy finishing second. Ball is with Costa Rica inside the England half. Ruiz is there,
[2111.52 - 2116.08] P:1715.60 E:0.086766 |  just finding space. Campbell back again to Ruiz. They seem to have a good understanding those two.
[2116.08 - 2121.68] P:1767.94 E:0.087155 |  Back into midfield and now the highly rated Takeda. The young man, just 22 years of age, who's
[2121.68 - 2125.52] P:1758.08 E:0.088416 |  making an impression here at the World Cup. Costa Rica give the ball away, very tight for
[2125.52 - 2129.36] P:1835.26 E:0.091614 |  England in midfield, short from Wilshire, but Lampard now has managed to scoop it down this
[2129.36 - 2134.00] P:1825.65 E:0.093525 |  left-hand side. Milner, who's a really good athlete, is there on the ball. Lola and Sturridge
[2134.00 - 2138.48] P:1792.37 E:0.091107 |  in the penalty area. Can Milner cross this towards Sturridge or Lola? Great goalkeeping.
[2138.48 - 2145.20] P:1877.11 E:0.091214 |  Fantastic from Navas. And he really, as Alan was saying earlier, is earning himself quite a
[2145.28 - 2150.00] P:1752.82 E:0.087739 |  reputation in Spain. It's a really good take. James Milner did very, very well, not only to catch
[2150.00 - 2156.16] P:1691.99 E:0.085407 |  the ball down this side, but then to dig out a decent cross on his left foot, which is a weaker side.
[2157.20 - 2162.24] P:1684.73 E:0.092617 |  No real purpose from England. That's what I've been most disappointed about. This is a young side.
[2162.24 - 2167.28] P:1766.97 E:0.086848 |  Go on playing with some pride. Put in some effort. This is the last game of a World Cup. Okay,
[2167.28 - 2173.12] P:1630.85 E:0.081477 |  we're out of the tournament, but deal with it. Move on. We talk about a fresh start. We talk about
[2173.76 - 2179.52] P:1635.73 E:0.085862 |  moving on from here. I've not seen anything to really impress me from a singling from players here.
[2179.52 - 2183.76] P:1703.48 E:0.092045 |  That's given away by Costa Rica in midfield. Lampard has won the ball, and now Lampard finds
[2183.76 - 2188.08] P:1815.66 E:0.091955 |  Barkley. Wilshire's made a run. He can find him, but it's just ahead of him, and now comes the keeper
[2188.08 - 2192.08] P:1758.15 E:0.091397 |  once more. The final pass there from Barkley, not the one that Wilshire wanted. By the way,
[2192.80 - 2198.56] P:1662.59 E:0.085683 |  Prince Harry's here today, and I've noticed quite a few young ladies in the stadium are offering to
[2198.56 - 2206.40] P:1689.63 E:0.080119 |  marry him, holding up the flags, saying, marry me, Harry. So he's watching on, and
[2208.56 - 2212.64] P:1598.56 E:0.102213 |  will obviously be disappointed like all the other England supporters that England are at this stage.
[2212.64 - 2217.36] P:1655.59 E:0.089521 |  It was two years ago today, by the way, they lost to Italy on penalties in the quarterfinal of the
[2217.36 - 2222.88] P:1628.64 E:0.089030 |  Euros, and 10 years ago today, they lost to Portugal on penalties in the quarterfinal of 2004. They
[2222.88 - 2228.08] P:1570.20 E:0.092097 |  haven't got to the quarterfinal or a penalty shootout this time around. So let's go and rejoin Ian
[2228.08 - 2232.56] P:1510.32 E:0.094204 |  Dennis in the sunshine down their pitchside. Wilting in the heat here, Mike. The only observation
[2232.56 - 2236.08] P:1566.17 E:0.097652 |  I'd say pitchside is that with the exception of Milner, who's now switched to the left in the
[2236.08 - 2241.04] P:1378.60 E:0.094861 |  Llaner when he just peeled away a few minutes before, in the central midfield areas for England,
[2241.04 - 2245.52] P:1274.91 E:0.093132 |  there is a real lack of movement that I've noticed in comparison to the Costa Rica side,
[2245.52 - 2249.12] P:1244.49 E:0.093910 |  and I've also got to add the England support behind me is unwavering.
[2251.52 - 2255.28] P:1659.94 E:0.095063 |  Thank you. I mean, the thing is, Danny, many of your fans would have, would have, would be here
[2255.28 - 2258.16] P:1599.36 E:0.089325 |  for the first time. They probably haven't been to the first two games. This is their package,
[2258.16 - 2261.60] P:1568.23 E:0.086532 |  and they've come out here, and they're just going to make the most of it, aren't they?
[2261.60 - 2264.88] P:1711.76 E:0.094082 |  Going again, just to reiterate what Ian says and what he's looking at. You know,
[2264.88 - 2269.28] P:1556.92 E:0.087375 |  Ross Barkley is on the ball now. Where's his options? Where are the players moving? You
[2269.28 - 2274.24] P:1823.75 E:0.086113 |  should have two, at least two, three options every time you get the ball, because if not,
[2274.24 - 2277.92] P:1710.71 E:0.083761 |  it's predictable, and it's easy to play against. And that's exactly what's happening to England
[2277.92 - 2283.92] P:1658.44 E:0.077482 |  at the moment. The Llaner is really still struggling to make an impact here. He's operating on the
[2283.92 - 2287.44] P:1629.95 E:0.093853 |  right-hand side at the moment, not really influencing the game. It just goes to show
[2287.44 - 2292.00] P:1593.30 E:0.084724 |  them, like, what a step up international football is to Premier League. You know, from Premier League to
[2293.36 - 2299.28] P:1669.66 E:0.088089 |  international, it's probably three steps on the ladder. You know, so halfway between that is maybe
[2299.28 - 2303.68] P:1767.22 E:0.100355 |  Champions League, but even still, you know, international is way beyond the Premier League.
[2304.48 - 2308.16] P:1693.65 E:0.098205 |  Well, Costa Rica have just dreadfully given the ball away, but can it, are England going to be
[2308.16 - 2312.64] P:1787.41 E:0.089130 |  good enough here to take advantage? Because Costa Rica, for the most part here on the back foot,
[2312.72 - 2316.40] P:1670.30 E:0.081350 |  they're just happy with what they have. They know they haven't got to do anything too reckless.
[2316.40 - 2320.48] P:1695.08 E:0.084558 |  They certainly mustn't get any cards like we've just heard about Ballatelli now,
[2320.48 - 2326.40] P:1704.01 E:0.083160 |  if Italy go through being out of the game in the last 16. So England with Frank Lampard. Lampard,
[2326.40 - 2332.08] P:1648.97 E:0.086606 |  that's a good ball for sure. Hasn't really got forward very much, sure. Now to James Milner.
[2332.08 - 2337.52] P:1702.80 E:0.091847 |  Milner is being tackled, and the ball is with Costa Rica, and Takeda's there. And he's going to use
[2337.52 - 2342.64] P:1713.22 E:0.088909 |  Campbell's pace down this right hand side. Campbell now nudges the ball off to Gamboa,
[2342.64 - 2346.56] P:1769.17 E:0.088686 |  the right back. Costa Rica players in the area, and it's too close to Foster.
[2346.56 - 2352.08] P:1786.23 E:0.091819 |  Foster makes a comfortable save, and we'll now relaunch England, and we have six minutes to go
[2352.08 - 2357.52] P:1686.98 E:0.081413 |  in the first half. And the game really is in third gear, for the most part, and Foster now
[2358.08 - 2361.52] P:1649.26 E:0.088986 |  to clear for England. They will, of course, make three changes at some point in the second half.
[2361.52 - 2365.84] P:1634.01 E:0.093429 |  Allen's already speculated about whether Foster might be given a game, because certainly Rojhaj
[2365.84 - 2369.36] P:1714.23 E:0.095141 |  and what's all the players in the squad at least be able to go back and say,
[2369.36 - 2373.68] P:1749.93 E:0.092482 |  I experienced the World Cup. And what a dreadful clearance that was acknowledged immediately
[2373.68 - 2378.64] P:1768.47 E:0.092956 |  there by Ben Foster out of play, handing the initiative straight back again to the team
[2378.64 - 2383.20] P:1690.45 E:0.092707 |  in the red shirts from Central America. I've been disappointed with England. I have to say,
[2383.20 - 2386.88] P:1702.20 E:0.097821 |  I thought this is an opportunity for these younger players to come out and really
[2387.44 - 2391.52] P:1717.13 E:0.092968 |  make an impact. You know, your last game, a lot of these haven't played. They're fresh.
[2392.48 - 2395.04] P:1672.73 E:0.104885 |  You know, go out, show what you can do. But at the moment,
[2395.84 - 2399.60] P:1502.64 E:0.089021 |  it's not even been a lukewarm performance. It's like Luster. It really is.
[2400.24 - 2404.56] P:1609.34 E:0.094359 |  Take the game to Costa Rica. Go and beat them. You know, okay, they've beaten Uruguay. They've
[2404.56 - 2409.28] P:1648.68 E:0.090201 |  beaten Italy. They're not world beaters by any means. This is a game that this, even this young
[2409.28 - 2414.40] P:1551.27 E:0.084963 |  England team, if they put their minds to it, if they went out, could go and win. But, Danny, I do
[2414.40 - 2419.04] P:1506.35 E:0.088385 |  remember Italian 90, for example, when England lost the semi-final, I had to play the third,
[2419.04 - 2422.48] P:1626.37 E:0.090246 |  fourth place game. I'm not sure too many players wanted to play in that particular game, and
[2422.48 - 2427.28] P:1683.41 E:0.097824 |  it was the same in 88 as well. Third and fourth place, I think, is different, though. This is a
[2427.28 - 2430.88] P:1619.94 E:0.088356 |  young, a lot of these players haven't played in the World Cup. It's not their responsibility,
[2430.88 - 2435.92] P:1730.07 E:0.090132 |  what happened in the last games. Go out and prove yourself on the biggest stage. Go win 3-0.
[2435.92 - 2439.36] P:1684.37 E:0.086997 |  That was a chance for Wilshire, if he had looked up to playing Jones over on the far side of the
[2439.36 - 2442.80] P:1692.80 E:0.095996 |  field. But now instead, it's going down this left-hand side, and Milner's going to lose that.
[2444.40 - 2448.64] P:1666.64 E:0.097955 |  The heads were down there, and Jones did offer himself over on the right. He was in space,
[2449.04 - 2453.52] P:1686.83 E:0.092691 |  but the ball was played short. Let us go back as we move towards the end of the first half to
[2453.52 - 2459.76] P:1648.51 E:0.097864 |  Natal Conor McNamara. Yeah, still very tense, very edgy here. Italy, 0. Uruguay, 0. A draw,
[2459.76 - 2464.16] P:1534.98 E:0.094731 |  good enough for Italy. Uruguay need a win to be sure. The referee's a busy man,
[2464.16 - 2468.64] P:1611.05 E:0.090482 |  Batnev, and Suarez has just tripped Pirlo down below us. I mean, there's been so many freekicks
[2468.64 - 2473.44] P:1494.23 E:0.093670 |  in the game. Tough point to referee, but there's a lot of tension, as you see out there. Biggest
[2473.44 - 2478.32] P:1500.33 E:0.091993 |  thing for me, I think the game's been strangled really to death by the Italian defence as much as
[2478.32 - 2483.28] P:1607.25 E:0.090478 |  anything else. They really do look like he wants to play simply as a break. Nothing more.
[2483.28 - 2488.96] P:1687.87 E:0.082038 |  Italy, 0. Uruguay, 0. Same scoreline here. Milner's just picking himself up slowly, having been
[2488.96 - 2492.88] P:1782.86 E:0.088687 |  heavily tackled a few moments ago. Campbell's got a second chance now, having initially,
[2492.88 - 2496.72] P:1725.05 E:0.092029 |  I thought, given the ball away. Moved breaks down from Costa Rica, who are not playing particularly
[2496.72 - 2501.20] P:1709.72 E:0.085606 |  well themselves by their own standards. Milner is still having a problem. Trying to get back on
[2501.20 - 2506.48] P:1881.75 E:0.092407 |  his feet again, as now Ross Barkley has the ball, and Sturridge is looking for it. Sturridge now,
[2506.48 - 2510.96] P:1907.71 E:0.094965 |  back again to Barkley, edge of the area. Good quick feet from Barkley. Is there a shot at the end
[2510.96 - 2517.44] P:1886.08 E:0.089813 |  of it? Barkley shoots wide in the end. No composure in the end from Ross Barkley, as Milner now walks
[2517.44 - 2523.36] P:1700.00 E:0.080034 |  off that injury, and Costa Rica have a goal kick. You're right. No composure from Barkley. He was
[2523.36 - 2527.20] P:1701.75 E:0.087379 |  desperately getting shot away. He had no options. He was, you know, once he got the ball back off
[2527.20 - 2531.92] P:1767.36 E:0.079812 |  Sturridge, had nobody else to pass to, had to try and beat two or three defenders. England
[2531.92 - 2536.00] P:1645.20 E:0.091237 |  have got to start working harder when they've got the ball. Got to help each other out. It's a team
[2536.00 - 2540.48] P:1662.69 E:0.083517 |  game for goodness sake. Not sure who's coming on, of course, in the second half. It would be nice
[2540.48 - 2546.32] P:1549.03 E:0.087230 |  to think that we might see Raheem Sterling again. Only three changes can be made.
[2547.60 - 2552.16] P:1615.56 E:0.091395 |  And of course, I suppose Ricky Lambert, if Roy Hodges is looking at trying to play players who
[2552.16 - 2559.52] P:1634.58 E:0.083444 |  not had much action, he could turn to him as well. So Costa Rica nil, England nil, Italy nil, Uruguay nil.
[2559.52 - 2565.36] P:1678.08 E:0.087260 |  Here in Bellahorizonte, Costa Rica have a chance. They do have a chance because the referee has
[2565.44 - 2571.04] P:1737.59 E:0.084529 |  given them a free kick for the foul on Campbell. But I just get the feeling that they're playing
[2571.04 - 2574.72] P:1609.03 E:0.098072 |  a little bit within themselves here, Costa Rica. Oh, definitely. But rightly so, they're top of the
[2574.72 - 2579.20] P:1621.17 E:0.085643 |  group, Mike. They've got six points. You know, they only need a point and probably don't even need
[2579.20 - 2583.44] P:1560.25 E:0.085220 |  that with the way that the other game is going at the moment. They don't want to pick up injuries.
[2583.44 - 2588.40] P:1661.73 E:0.080259 |  They don't want to tie themselves out too much. You know, they don't have probably too many options,
[2588.40 - 2592.08] P:1728.89 E:0.083037 |  strength and depth from the bench. So they said, look, just get through this game. Don't
[2592.16 - 2595.44] P:1654.34 E:0.089762 |  anything silly. Keep the ball and get a draw. We win the group.
[2596.88 - 2600.40] P:1706.71 E:0.099072 |  Well, they scored it around about this time of the first half against Italy. They have this
[2600.40 - 2605.76] P:1718.87 E:0.085058 |  free kick and it's immediately flagged against them for offside, up on the far side. They scored
[2605.76 - 2609.92] P:1653.54 E:0.094727 |  right at the end of the first half through Brian Ruiz. And we were watching that game at the airport.
[2610.56 - 2616.00] P:1643.63 E:0.089900 |  And that goal was scored about 30 seconds or so after they were denied just about the clearest
[2616.00 - 2621.52] P:1651.22 E:0.082293 |  penalty they've ever seen against Italy. And that really was justice when Ruiz scored. We're moving
[2621.60 - 2624.80] P:1617.55 E:0.087938 |  towards added time here at the end of the first half. Well, England were fortunate there might
[2624.80 - 2629.44] P:1648.71 E:0.080237 |  have was given offside because there were two players at the back post. One of them was completely
[2629.44 - 2634.72] P:1706.01 E:0.089031 |  unmarked. Again, that's just lack of concentration. Individuals not doing their job. And that was
[2634.72 - 2638.56] P:1639.36 E:0.088866 |  really poor from storage. It was a nothing sort of ball into the penalty area. Not that there were
[2638.56 - 2643.36] P:1742.87 E:0.086185 |  too many England players offering themselves throw into England. The Larnas there and the Larnas
[2643.36 - 2647.68] P:1710.48 E:0.089339 |  balling will be cleared by Costa Rica to the far side for an England throw in. There won't be a
[2647.76 - 2651.68] P:1653.25 E:0.082407 |  great deal of time added on at the end of the first half as England have a throw in.
[2652.56 - 2658.00] P:1765.11 E:0.092470 |  Nilnil against Costa Rica. Jones is battling down that far side. Larnas gone down. England have a
[2658.00 - 2664.96] P:1760.37 E:0.080971 |  free kick right at the end of this first half. Now this normally would be taken by Gerard or
[2664.96 - 2669.36] P:1678.96 E:0.085126 |  maybe even Baines if they were on the field. They're not. Lampard's going across there.
[2670.56 - 2676.24] P:1685.79 E:0.092404 |  And at the end of an unconvincing first half for England, they do have a set piece
[2677.04 - 2682.80] P:1703.39 E:0.096061 |  and they have a chance to trouble the Costa Rican defenders. So Frank Lampard captained today.
[2683.68 - 2687.28] P:1678.36 E:0.101298 |  A little bit of wrestling going on down there in the area between Phil Jones.
[2688.48 - 2695.20] P:1640.12 E:0.097002 |  And in comes the free kick straight into the goalkeepers midriff. And that really in some respects
[2696.24 - 2700.08] P:1754.93 E:0.095254 |  shows up the Assyngland team. We're going to go now to Headingley. Pat Murphy.
[2700.16 - 2706.00] P:1657.21 E:0.092691 |  Stuart Broad's out LBW for naught. Last of the long time there, 24 balls. Thought about
[2706.00 - 2711.84] P:1689.87 E:0.095421 |  putting them TV review, decided not to. So the last pair are together. There are 20 overs left today.
[2711.84 - 2716.32] P:1645.61 E:0.091733 |  Sri Lanka needs one more wicket, 228 for nine, but it's getting darker.
[2718.08 - 2722.80] P:1794.08 E:0.100249 |  Thank you, Pat. That's the crumb of comfort maybe for England that the weather might intervene. But
[2722.80 - 2726.96] P:1864.69 E:0.095519 |  Danny Mills, it's half time here. They just talked to us while Pat was there. How on earth
[2727.04 - 2731.36] P:1699.13 E:0.101149 |  did Brenes suddenly fight? It was almost a Luis Suarez situation again. The ball was hit long
[2731.36 - 2736.88] P:1687.74 E:0.084535 |  and Brenes was in on goal on England. Shocking. Absolutely shocking. That is, again, how many
[2736.88 - 2741.44] P:1712.33 E:0.089411 |  times do you want to get punished from lack of concentration? A hoof downfield. That's all it
[2741.44 - 2745.84] P:1619.86 E:0.090404 |  was from the goalkeeper. Wasn't trying to pick a player. It's just a hopeful punt down the pitch.
[2746.64 - 2752.00] P:1643.41 E:0.095310 |  No one concentrating. Brenes was allowed to get in. Fortunately, touch wasn't brilliant
[2752.00 - 2755.84] P:1603.24 E:0.088100 |  in the end. And when he cut back, England got back and it was deflection. But that could have
[2755.84 - 2761.84] P:1656.27 E:0.092295 |  easily been one nil down. You cannot afford to switch off at any point during a World Cup game.
[2761.84 - 2765.60] P:1728.61 E:0.099917 |  Well, the England players have been saying in the build up to this game, Mark, that they are
[2766.40 - 2770.32] P:1628.91 E:0.095464 |  deeply concerned about all the fans who've come out here and haven't really seen them play.
[2770.32 - 2773.92] P:1616.06 E:0.092816 |  They felt they owed the fans today. Well, they're still owing them, I'm afraid. There hasn't been
[2773.92 - 2779.68] P:1589.46 E:0.095842 |  a great half. It's nil now. Just noticed that Paolo Wanchop, who's on the Costa Rican staff,
[2779.68 - 2783.52] P:1557.60 E:0.095394 |  having a chat with Frank Lampard as they left the pitch at half time. What do you think the Roy
[2783.52 - 2787.52] P:1711.66 E:0.090599 |  Hodgson looks at his bench? Maybe a change or two in the second half need to get some
[2787.52 - 2792.08] P:1769.65 E:0.089049 |  energy, some dynamism into this team, Danny? Change of attitude is what it needs more than
[2792.08 - 2796.48] P:1835.84 E:0.093750 |  anything else, not necessarily personnel. It's an abject performance. It's an opportunity for
[2796.48 - 2802.16] P:1832.24 E:0.085011 |  young players to show what they can do. Be a bit more dynamic. Give someone the option.
[2802.16 - 2807.60] P:1870.57 E:0.087450 |  Work hard. You've got 45 minutes left now. And then you can go on all day for three weeks.
[2808.24 - 2814.08] P:1901.94 E:0.090854 |  Give it everything you have possibly got. I'm looking at the moment, and that is a 75%
[2814.08 - 2819.76] P:1878.95 E:0.087121 |  performance. Simply, I don't think England are working hard enough. Well, who says that men
[2819.76 - 2823.36] P:1758.09 E:0.099951 |  can't multitask? Because I'm watching the England game and Connor, I'm watching your game on the
[2823.36 - 2828.08] P:1686.41 E:0.098872 |  television and everybody, every time I look up, someone's lying on the ground, riding around.
[2828.08 - 2832.00] P:1665.12 E:0.097763 |  Remarkably, there's only two minutes being added on for stoppages at the end of a very
[2832.00 - 2837.84] P:1867.02 E:0.088184 |  stop-start first half. Italy nil, Uruguay nil. It's an entertaining watch. It's an exciting watch,
[2837.84 - 2842.48] P:1798.80 E:0.090129 |  and you just feel if Cavani or Suarez can get some space, the whistle does now blow for halftime,
[2842.48 - 2847.04] P:1864.87 E:0.089789 |  that they could take a chance. But space is something the Italians do not give away in defense,
[2847.04 - 2853.12] P:1633.53 E:0.085808 |  Pat Nevin. It's a masterful display of the dark arts of football right now from the Italian defense,
[2853.12 - 2856.72] P:1553.79 E:0.096508 |  and that's not men's and astounding. That's just the way it is. They're very, very good at it.
[2856.72 - 2860.48] P:1477.37 E:0.093436 |  Every time they get down, they roll about, they're not really hurt. Killing the game,
[2860.48 - 2865.36] P:1554.64 E:0.087231 |  killing the pace of it. Everybody in here is a neutral once Uruguay scored a goal,
[2865.36 - 2869.68] P:1555.73 E:0.080252 |  so the game will open up a little bit. But in the end, it has to be Uruguay that must
[2869.68 - 2874.16] P:1735.41 E:0.087660 |  start taking more chances. The Italians have only had half chances themselves in Mobilea with a shot
[2874.16 - 2879.36] P:1645.90 E:0.089747 |  that was charged down. Ballatelli tried one out from well outside the penalty area. He's been
[2879.36 - 2885.12] P:1610.94 E:0.093396 |  booked. If Italy go through, Mario Ballatelli will miss the second round game. It's been the only
[2885.20 - 2891.76] P:1707.42 E:0.090044 |  yellow card in a first half full of strong tackles and fouls. With the Uruguayans now needing to
[2891.76 - 2896.80] P:1858.34 E:0.087824 |  score, as things stand, Costa Rica and Italy will be the two nations going through from this group.
[2896.80 - 2901.20] P:1714.49 E:0.081089 |  But a lot could change in the second half. Nil Nil. Thank you very much for the Jensen.
[2901.20 - 2905.60] P:1600.57 E:0.094280 |  Natal back to Pat Murphy at Headingley. The clouds are banking up. It's getting darker.
[2905.60 - 2910.00] P:1657.53 E:0.089850 |  Gia Wardner has had to come on to bowl his exploratory offspin because they can't trust
[2910.00 - 2914.32] P:1806.27 E:0.079172 |  the quicker bowlers because they'll be off the bad light. There are 20 overs ago. Anderson has
[2914.32 - 2920.88] P:1676.59 E:0.083477 |  done this before at Cardiff in 2009 with Panasar. The other end, can Moenale get his 100? Is made
[2920.88 - 2928.24] P:1692.45 E:0.081708 |  in 100 in his second test. 88 not out. 228 for nine. Sri Lanka need one more wicket. England need to
[2928.24 - 2934.16] P:1779.51 E:0.081801 |  endure for another 90 and a half overs. And of course, ball by ball on Five Live Sports Extra,
[2934.16 - 2938.32] P:1651.54 E:0.092197 |  and we will be going regularly over to Pat, who can keep us in touch with events there. When we're
[2938.32 - 2943.52] P:1674.68 E:0.094352 |  down here in Belo Horizonte, there's a 6-0-6 with Mark Chapman, Chris Waddle and Robbie Savage.
[2943.52 - 2951.20] P:1702.97 E:0.089861 |  The lines will open later. The usual number 0500 909 693 85058 on the text at BBC Five Live on
[2951.20 - 2957.36] P:1817.91 E:0.090172 |  social media and do use the hashtag BBC World Cup. Then at 9 o'clock, three teams can still progress
[2957.36 - 2963.12] P:1806.26 E:0.083644 |  from Group C. We'll bring you commentary on Greece, Ivory Coast and updates on Japan against
[2963.12 - 2970.00] P:1744.67 E:0.094030 |  Columbia. And that game, Japan, Columbia is live on BBC Three as well. Right, news time. Here's Lucy Gray.
[2970.40 - 2978.32] P:1502.53 E:0.087689 |  On digital, online, smart phone and tablet. This is BBC Five Live. David Cameron has apologised
[2978.32 - 2983.76] P:1690.17 E:0.087615 |  for hiring Andy Coulson to work as his director of communications at Downing Street. After a jury
[2983.76 - 2988.72] P:1463.99 E:0.085019 |  at the Old Bailey convicted the former News of the World editor of phone hacking. The Prime Minister
[2988.72 - 2993.36] P:1615.53 E:0.073494 |  says he takes full responsibility for the decision. I asked him and my chief of staff asked him whether
[2993.36 - 2997.84] P:1401.65 E:0.081185 |  he knew about phone hacking. We accepted his assurances. That was the basis on which I employed
[2997.84 - 3003.28] P:1540.87 E:0.088105 |  him. I was always clear that I was giving someone a second chance. He had resigned from the news of
[3003.28 - 3008.48] P:1403.43 E:0.078749 |  the world because of what had happened there. I accepted his assurances. I gave him a job. It
[3008.48 - 3014.16] P:1522.77 E:0.087050 |  turns out to be a bad decision and I'm extremely sorry about that. Andy Coulson now faces a maximum
[3014.16 - 3019.68] P:1618.47 E:0.084825 |  of two years in prison for hacking. The former News International chief executive Rebecca Brooks was
[3019.68 - 3024.72] P:1509.07 E:0.083124 |  cleared of all the charges against her, along with four other people. The Labour leader Ed Miliband
[3024.72 - 3029.52] P:1140.16 E:0.095547 |  says the government has been tainted by Mr Coulson's appointment. David Cameron must do much more
[3029.52 - 3036.16] P:997.09 E:0.083893 |  than an apology. He owes the country an explanation for why he did not act, why he did not act on
[3036.16 - 3042.24] P:685.41 E:0.084649 |  these allegations against Andy Coulson, why has the evidence piled up? He didn't do anything about it
[3042.24 - 3047.20] P:1086.56 E:0.093695 |  and he's got to explain. And Five Live's chief political correspondent John Pena says David Cameron
[3047.20 - 3052.00] P:1792.00 E:0.093309 |  now faces many questions. He's under heavy attack for hiring Coulson. He can expect to get more stick
[3052.00 - 3057.04] P:1760.38 E:0.088086 |  on that front at question time in the House of Commons tomorrow. The apology, it was absolutely
[3057.04 - 3061.36] P:1604.99 E:0.104099 |  unavoidable. He'll hope that it does something to disarm the criticism against him. I guess the
[3061.36 - 3066.96] P:1693.33 E:0.090591 |  test is going to be, does it dent his ratings? Police say that thousands of people's phones were
[3066.96 - 3071.68] P:1617.55 E:0.090091 |  targeted by the news of the world. The lawyer Charlotte Harris represents many of the victims
[3071.68 - 3076.64] P:1509.29 E:0.078887 |  and she's been describing how they're likely to be reflecting on what happened. People forget how
[3076.64 - 3085.60] P:1607.55 E:0.078520 |  creepy it is not knowing how personal information finds its way into a newspaper. So before the
[3085.60 - 3091.04] P:1484.04 E:0.080742 |  awareness of phone hacking began, I had clients who were falling out with their nearest and their
[3091.04 - 3096.64] P:1590.05 E:0.080584 |  dearest and their trusted employees thinking that there was some kind of leak. If you are a person
[3096.64 - 3103.68] P:1794.48 E:0.069114 |  who has been working for a celebrity who is of interest to the press, why should you be in a
[3103.68 - 3110.08] P:1696.93 E:0.074277 |  position where your phone is not only hacked but you also find yourself under suspicion?
[3110.08 - 3115.36] P:1498.52 E:0.101231 |  Well the news of the world was closed by its parent company News International in July 2011
[3115.36 - 3120.24] P:1359.36 E:0.095030 |  after it emerged that a private investigator was asked to hack voicemails left on the mobile phone
[3120.24 - 3125.68] P:1500.10 E:0.092006 |  of the murdered Surrey teenager Millie Dowler in 2002. Paul Horrocks is the former editor of the
[3125.68 - 3130.48] P:1511.61 E:0.085443 |  Manchester Evening News. He also sits on the panel which appoints members of the proposed new press
[3130.56 - 3135.84] P:1534.30 E:0.092547 |  regulator Ipsu. We've gone through a pretty dreadful chapter in newspaper history haven't we?
[3135.84 - 3141.60] P:1793.75 E:0.095433 |  The criminal justice system has run, is running its course. We've had one of the longest British
[3141.60 - 3146.08] P:1188.19 E:0.103023 |  criminal trials ever. We've had one of the longest police inquiries ever although that was a very
[3146.08 - 3150.88] P:1732.42 E:0.099415 |  slow start. So I think the public can now have the absolute confidence that there's no stolen
[3150.88 - 3155.12] P:1523.85 E:0.093534 |  and left unturned. And the racehorse trainer Sir Mark Prescott is a friend of Rebecca and
[3155.12 - 3159.84] P:1561.94 E:0.087769 |  Charlie Brooks. He says the trial has taken its toll especially the revelation that Rebecca Brooks
[3159.84 - 3166.24] P:1363.66 E:0.075057 |  had an affair with Andy Coulson. Anybody who's experienced one of this sort of court case plenty
[3166.24 - 3171.12] P:1210.79 E:0.084282 |  of skeletons are rattled around in all our wardrobes. It's bound to have been an uncomfortable
[3171.12 - 3178.08] P:1250.85 E:0.075904 |  experience for both of them but I suppose any disaster in a married couple's life has one of
[3178.08 - 3183.52] P:1291.68 E:0.075170 |  two effects doesn't it? It either drives a wedge between them or binds them closer together.
[3183.52 - 3188.24] P:1458.03 E:0.081240 |  Hopefully it will have been the latter. So just to recap on the hacking charges then Andy Coulson
[3188.40 - 3193.44] P:1550.20 E:0.083641 |  found guilty of a charge of conspiracy to intercept voicemails. Rebecca Brooks was cleared of all
[3193.44 - 3198.40] P:1666.36 E:0.084203 |  charges along with her husband, her PA and the former head of security for News International.
[3198.40 - 3202.72] P:1473.86 E:0.091246 |  The former news of the world managing editor Stuart Cutner was found not guilty of conspiring to
[3202.72 - 3208.24] P:1635.94 E:0.077491 |  hack voicemails and the jury is still considering misconduct in her public office charges against
[3208.24 - 3212.64] P:1381.20 E:0.082876 |  Andy Coulson and the former news of the world royal editor Clive Goodman which relates to
[3212.64 - 3217.76] P:1668.17 E:0.081427 |  allegations of paying officials for royal phone directories. In other news then the US secretary
[3217.76 - 3224.08] P:1685.08 E:0.085667 |  of state John Kerry has told the BBC there must be regional unity to expel ISIS rebels who've taken
[3224.08 - 3229.12] P:1151.11 E:0.092516 |  over much of northern and western Iraq. It's not up to the United States of America or some other
[3229.12 - 3234.32] P:1014.86 E:0.081343 |  country to come prancing in and tell Iraqis who their leaders ought to be or what they need to do.
[3234.32 - 3241.28] P:1219.58 E:0.086638 |  What we're trying to do is honor a process. It's up to Iraqis to decide who can unify Iraq, who
[3241.28 - 3247.12] P:1184.39 E:0.081499 |  will they all come together and join with in an effort to seize this moment. John Kerry has been
[3247.20 - 3251.76] P:1463.58 E:0.093866 |  talking to Kurdish leaders in the northern city of Irbil. The rebels are still advancing and are
[3251.76 - 3257.12] P:1589.04 E:0.082975 |  fighting to take a key oil refinery. The Ukrainian military says one of its helicopters has been
[3257.12 - 3262.48] P:1567.90 E:0.086387 |  shot down by pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country. It says the aircraft was hit by a rocket
[3262.48 - 3267.92] P:1577.27 E:0.074174 |  just after takeoff near the city of Sloviansk. Reports say all nine people on board were killed.

[3405.44 - 3410.88] P:1651.66 E:0.081995 |  Wimbledon. Serena Williams is on centre court mark, first game of her match against
[3411.68 - 3416.80] P:1627.19 E:0.088553 |  Anna Tattish-Villy. It's lasted eight minutes, she saved three break points and they're back to
[3416.80 - 3421.60] P:1698.50 E:0.088790 |  juice. Earlier in the day, straightforward wins for the likes of Roger Federer, Stan Vavrenko,
[3421.60 - 3427.20] P:1535.75 E:0.092478 |  Miloš Rownic and Anjaska Radvanska. And in the end David Law for Rafa Nadal, but we were wondering
[3427.20 - 3431.36] P:1495.02 E:0.083231 |  at the end of that first set whether Nadal was going to suffer another early exit from these
[3431.36 - 3436.08] P:1693.60 E:0.091474 |  championships. That's right, it took him nearly three hours to get past Martin Cleese, Anna Slovakia
[3436.08 - 3441.68] P:1663.89 E:0.079446 |  and the Slovakian won the first set six forwards, some incredible hitting from the baseline.
[3441.68 - 3445.68] P:1691.42 E:0.098234 |  Reminded us of the match he had against Lukas Rossell two years ago when he lost in the second
[3445.68 - 3450.40] P:1609.47 E:0.080794 |  round and Steve Darcy's last year when he lost in the first round. But eventually Nadal got over
[3450.40 - 3454.96] P:1517.85 E:0.082182 |  the finish line and I suspect he'll be quite dangerous from here and he faces a revenge
[3454.96 - 3459.76] P:1496.66 E:0.087602 |  mission against Lukas Rossell in the second round here this year. Britain's women's number one,

[3464.96 - 3472.40] P:1746.37 E:0.084308 |  Croatia in straight set 6-3-6-2. Sam Murray won just the one game against Maria Sharapova and
[3472.40 - 3476.80] P:1550.12 E:0.086377 |  there's another British player in action at the moment, Dan Smethurst up against John Isner
[3476.80 - 3482.48] P:1496.36 E:0.079011 |  on court three. Karthin Jarnas Seagram is watching. Thanks Russell, the ninth seed and famous for that
[3482.48 - 3486.72] P:1673.45 E:0.092404 |  longest match in tennis history. Doesn't look like he'll be out here for long against the British
[3486.72 - 3492.32] P:1445.11 E:0.085937 |  number five Dan Smethurst. He's making his Wimbledon debut and Isner is two sets to love ahead.
[3492.40 - 3497.68] P:1417.11 E:0.080931 |  He took the first set 7-5, Smethurst unable to convert any of his six break points. The second
[3497.68 - 3502.64] P:1449.89 E:0.083744 |  set was 6-3. It's going with serve in the third set but it does look as if Andy Murray will be the
[3502.64 - 3507.36] P:1431.96 E:0.076349 |  only British player left in the men's draw by tomorrow. Smethurst in trouble on court three.
[3507.36 - 3512.72] P:1457.09 E:0.097267 |  Highest profile casualty of the day so far, former French open finalist Sarah Irani beaten by the
[3512.72 - 3518.40] P:1569.66 E:0.087164 |  up-and-coming French player Caroline Garcia and Serilla Williams has finally held serve.
[3518.40 - 3523.52] P:1472.20 E:0.080353 |  He took a precisely 10 minutes mark. Thank you very much, Eddie, for that Russell. Let's
[3523.52 - 3530.64] P:1662.95 E:0.087177 |  turn it back to Pat Murphy at heading Lee. 16 overs left 234 for nine. The target a distant one of
[3530.64 - 3536.88] P:1621.33 E:0.090149 |  350. The light has improved marginally. That's why Eranga is back on now. So, battle is joined.
[3538.32 - 3541.60] P:1588.00 E:0.093563 |  Gia Wardner off. He really didn't trouble the batsman too much and now
[3542.72 - 3547.68] P:1650.39 E:0.091080 |  Mohenali has an interesting problem here, Mark. He has to play for the team. Of course he does.
[3547.68 - 3553.28] P:1631.34 E:0.090200 |  But he's within one blow of his first test match century in his second test. So, he's got a bit
[3553.28 - 3557.76] P:1579.27 E:0.094741 |  of a conundrum there but he has experienced Anderson at the other end who's an old hand at this. You
[3557.76 - 3564.96] P:1586.53 E:0.090044 |  remember Cardiff 2009 with Monty Panazar blocking out against the Aussies. Pat, I've seen the still
[3564.96 - 3569.36] P:1635.80 E:0.094590 |  of the prior dismissal. Is there going to be a bit of a bani about that? I mean, look,
[3569.36 - 3574.08] P:1751.84 E:0.093299 |  to the naked eye, it looks like it is a no-ball but Paul Reifel, the fourth umpire, said there was
[3574.08 - 3578.08] P:1568.85 E:0.089879 |  something behind the line and therefore the ball was valid. First of all, it was a poor shot by
[3578.08 - 3583.84] P:1577.80 E:0.079113 |  prior fending off the short leg. So, let's not forget that. But yes, I tell you why because you need
[3583.84 - 3591.20] P:1644.74 E:0.079049 |  consistency, don't you? And Jordan was given a not out in a very, very similar situation about a
[3591.20 - 3596.16] P:1355.34 E:0.086046 |  no-ball half an hour later. So, I think that's what will exercise England players as well. And
[3597.04 - 3603.92] P:1668.81 E:0.084912 |  I have to say, it looked to me with pride that they stopped the frame too early. Just one more
[3604.00 - 3608.72] P:1572.05 E:0.078458 |  frame and we could have been absolutely certain about the foot which was over the line. It did
[3608.72 - 3613.36] P:1509.69 E:0.083145 |  look a no-ball. It did look as if prior was unlucky. But I'm not sure in the context of a five-day
[3613.36 - 3618.24] P:1669.41 E:0.086423 |  test match whether that should be deemed decisive. I think Angela Matthews, 160, was more decisive
[3618.24 - 3622.32] P:1613.51 E:0.097044 |  and not bowling. It not bowling Sri Lanka out for 150 when they should have done on day one.
[3623.36 - 3626.88] P:1713.71 E:0.103775 |  Thank you, Pat. Ball by ball test match special. Quick where with Chris Waddle, the four-hand
[3626.88 - 3631.68] P:1713.80 E:0.088077 |  back to Alan Green in Rio. Chris, your thoughts on the first half? I'll be quick because obviously
[3631.76 - 3636.32] P:1440.89 E:0.097154 |  coming out could play higher when the ball goes up, get a bit tighter, squeeze it, play a little
[3636.32 - 3639.68] P:1546.55 E:0.091619 |  bit. They've got four in midfield and one up front. So, we're getting out done slightly there.
[3640.64 - 3645.12] P:1516.27 E:0.092241 |  Play a little bit higher. I still think we're so naive. I would say so. It's a fair point.
[3645.84 - 3650.56] P:1614.67 E:0.090583 |  Too much space in midfield. We mark space. We don't mark players. And we're looking for leaders,
[3650.56 - 3656.00] P:1624.58 E:0.088745 |  players who want to step on at this level and take it, get a shirt. And our best way to score at
[3656.00 - 3660.72] P:1594.30 E:0.087733 |  the minute, apart from storage at the odd occasion, is set pieces still. So, we're males off certain
[3660.72 - 3665.20] P:1586.12 E:0.091312 |  things. But I agree. There's no energy. It doesn't look like we want to close the ball down.
[3665.92 - 3669.04] P:1331.47 E:0.083516 |  And we're letting them play and we're making them look better than what they are.
[3669.76 - 3674.40] P:1679.10 E:0.105391 |  Thank you, Chris, with Mark Chapman and Robbie Savage, 6-0-6. The lines are open. No 500, 9-0-9,
[3674.40 - 3681.44] P:1555.61 E:0.083622 |  6-9-3. Nil-nil, Italy, Uruguay as well. Alan Green. During half time, a banner was being displayed
[3681.44 - 3688.32] P:1490.28 E:0.092404 |  by an England fan. And without going into total detail, it listed the cost of flights,
[3689.04 - 3696.64] P:1435.53 E:0.096099 |  costs here in Brazil, and, quote, enjoying ambience. And it came to £5,200. And it ended
[3697.28 - 3704.64] P:1435.83 E:0.098949 |  feeling ungoing home priceless. Well, this has been the worst England display of the three so far.
[3704.64 - 3709.76] P:1513.45 E:0.094426 |  And it just showed what we found out in Miami that the rest are nowhere near good enough.
[3710.96 - 3716.56] P:1716.25 E:0.096322 |  The attitude has been poor, apart from a couple of shots by storage and a header over by storage
[3716.56 - 3723.28] P:1536.07 E:0.087552 |  that has become to a goal was a Costa Rican goal. A free kit from Borges, Borges rather,
[3723.28 - 3729.84] P:1488.17 E:0.087419 |  that was tipped onto the top of the crossbar by Ben Foster. What can I say?
[3732.96 - 3738.88] P:1537.33 E:0.101811 |  A banner is being, crosses to George, has been rolled across between England fans away to my right.
[3738.88 - 3744.32] P:1507.42 E:0.091119 |  We're still waiting for the referee from Algeria to blow the whistle for the start of the second half.
[3744.32 - 3750.96] P:1633.10 E:0.090161 |  No changes in either lineup. First of all, England goalkeeper Foster defends Jones-Cahill,
[3750.96 - 3756.96] P:1606.78 E:0.090617 |  Smolling and Shaw, then Lampard, then four strong across midfielder, front-to-front Lampard,
[3757.60 - 3763.68] P:1525.76 E:0.092271 |  Milner, Wilshire Barkley, and Lallana, and finally, Sturridge, who far too often has been isolated.
[3763.68 - 3769.60] P:1598.88 E:0.093169 |  The goalkeeper for Costa Rica is Navas. Five across there defends, Defends, Gambo, Duarte,
[3769.60 - 3777.12] P:1603.57 E:0.080718 |  Gonzalez, Milner and Diaz, then Borges, Ruiz and Piqueda, and finally Brenes and Cambo.
[3777.68 - 3780.88] P:1620.33 E:0.091617 |  And we're still waiting for television to say it's okay.
[3781.76 - 3786.08] P:1814.04 E:0.099422 |  Now they've got to wait Alan for the two games. The two games have to start simultaneously.
[3786.08 - 3788.72] P:1560.94 E:0.090225 |  That's why. That's the Italian one was slightly delayed. By the way,
[3788.72 - 3794.48] P:1655.81 E:0.086075 |  Perolo has come on for Italy replacing Balotelli as a second half substitute.
[3794.72 - 3802.40] P:1582.27 E:0.086694 |  So the match of significance, frankly, is in the towel. Which of Uruguayan Italy
[3802.40 - 3808.88] P:1605.93 E:0.088794 |  will join Costa Rica in the last 16? Costa Rica, I've just strolled through this.
[3808.88 - 3815.60] P:1498.35 E:0.088316 |  They haven't been put under any pressure whatsoever. That's a careless ball hit up by their central
[3815.60 - 3819.92] P:1517.90 E:0.092013 |  defender Gonzalez, straight out of the play on the near side of the field. England all in white,
[3819.92 - 3825.68] P:1551.04 E:0.080459 |  attacking the end to our right. Costa Rica in their red shirts, blue shorts and red socks.
[3825.68 - 3832.16] P:1549.32 E:0.078811 |  There's a complete lack of urgency in the England team. Jones with the throw in to Barclay.
[3832.88 - 3839.52] P:1510.90 E:0.086673 |  On to Jones. Lallana's around the edge of the day, but it's back instead to Wilshire, who has given
[3839.52 - 3845.92] P:1532.61 E:0.084144 |  the ball away again. Wilshire was the big hope of English football. What's happened to Jack Wilshire?
[3846.00 - 3851.04] P:1589.86 E:0.086101 |  I know he's had a succession of injuries, Danny, but he doesn't look anything like the player who's
[3851.04 - 3856.32] P:1483.98 E:0.086108 |  suddenly sparkle per Arsenal. Anyway, England having defended the moment with Cahill and Cahill
[3856.88 - 3864.16] P:1509.31 E:0.087433 |  puts it out of play, throw in to Costa Rica. It's going to be taken by Diaz. They're left wing back.
[3866.24 - 3871.60] P:1418.58 E:0.096397 |  Not that he's had any defensive pressure put on him. The throw-ins level with the
[3871.60 - 3877.68] P:1473.29 E:0.087271 |  edge of the England penalty area. Ben Foster's goal now covered in shadow. Throw in wasted by
[3877.68 - 3883.68] P:1479.46 E:0.083997 |  Costa Rica, but Lampard in clearing the ball not only got a knock, but he's given it away
[3883.68 - 3888.40] P:1506.55 E:0.085008 |  to Costa Rica. Costa Rica may well think of putting the ball out of play, and they do pull it out of
[3888.40 - 3895.20] P:1527.26 E:0.082401 |  play through Decatur so that Lampard, who's back on his feet now, can receive attention. Should he need it?
[3895.92 - 3902.64] P:1652.95 E:0.094838 |  I don't think anybody will need to come on to see the Frank Lampard. So in
[3902.64 - 3906.08] P:1699.45 E:0.106671 |  England throwing, it should be given back to Costa Rica.
[3908.80 - 3911.60] P:1669.86 E:0.098897 |  And we thought that Belgium-Russia was bad.
[3913.36 - 3918.56] P:1515.26 E:0.095706 |  And there's something to play for there as well. But things are right down at half time.
[3919.44 - 3926.08] P:1580.36 E:0.092598 |  Lack of identity, lack of movement, lack of tactical knowledge. That means where to be to
[3926.08 - 3932.16] P:1519.30 E:0.088729 |  receive the ball, what positions to be to make yourself available. Lack of energy, you know,
[3932.16 - 3938.48] P:1406.73 E:0.085873 |  both with the ball and without the ball. It's just, it is a very lackluster performance. I know
[3938.48 - 3943.60] P:1456.27 E:0.088824 |  that they're out of the tournament. Yes, it's bitterly disappointing, but as I said, there's only one
[3944.48 - 3949.84] P:1589.78 E:0.094425 |  player that's really been involved in all that. Here's Shaw. Sorry, two players, we tell you her
[3949.84 - 3954.88] P:1680.00 E:0.092834 |  in storage. Yeah, Shaw rushing down the left side. He's been foul tackled and it's going to be a free
[3954.88 - 3961.20] P:1497.45 E:0.088432 |  kick to England. And it's ten yards to the left of the penalty, directly in line with the outside of
[3961.20 - 3968.72] P:1474.03 E:0.083186 |  the penalty area. And Frank Lampard's going across to take it. So I was played in with the
[3968.72 - 3972.32] P:1509.74 E:0.088374 |  penalty, but I think that's too quick for the referee, like he's going to call the ball back
[3972.32 - 3976.96] P:1484.12 E:0.082130 |  and Lampard's going to have to play it again. And that option, presumably, is not available now.
[3977.60 - 3982.72] P:1534.99 E:0.088725 |  The run from Lallana. So it's from the left. Three minutes played in the second half here
[3983.28 - 3989.44] P:1523.18 E:0.086504 |  in Belo Horizonte. Lampard right footed, swirls it in, easily headed clear by Costa Rica,
[3989.44 - 3994.48] P:1623.69 E:0.089386 |  towards the halfway line, picked up by Milit, Milit rushes for Paul Pritzker,
[3994.48 - 3999.04] P:1728.98 E:0.097283 |  storage in the penalty area. Good anticipation by Navas the goalkeeper. Quickly out to smother
[3999.04 - 4004.56] P:1712.86 E:0.087242 |  the attempted shot from Daniel Sturridge. Well, Sturridge said three or four good half chances.
[4005.76 - 4011.20] P:1633.54 E:0.094961 |  England on the attack again down the left side, but the ball is hooked high and beyond any white
[4011.20 - 4016.96] P:1575.03 E:0.081286 |  shirt inside the Costa Rican penalty area and cleared by Diaz. Here's Campbell. Campbell,
[4017.52 - 4022.96] P:1617.56 E:0.090182 |  he got the slightest of nudges there from Phil Jones, goes over and it's a free kick to Costa Rica.
[4023.76 - 4029.76] P:1688.07 E:0.093045 |  Sturridge hasn't quite shown that sharpness he certainly saw last season at club level.
[4029.76 - 4034.88] P:1727.15 E:0.089057 |  The ball came to him, just miscontrolled it. Maybe just took his eye off it for a second.
[4034.88 - 4039.84] P:1783.21 E:0.094728 |  Paul bounced up, hit his shin and Navas was out very, very quickly. A little bit surprised
[4039.84 - 4044.56] P:1728.09 E:0.093444 |  that a free kick wasn't given. Sturridge slid in, didn't catch the ball and caught the keeper who
[4044.56 - 4051.52] P:1545.32 E:0.089604 |  has now gone down. I assume from that challenge. Yes, I think so. Navas is a good goalkeeper.
[4051.60 - 4059.60] P:1397.96 E:0.088364 |  We're seeing it again. And someone will pick him up from Levante in Spain. Sturridge going to see him.
[4059.60 - 4065.60] P:1520.89 E:0.087819 |  Check that he's actually all right. But he's receiving treatment at the moment just on the edge
[4065.60 - 4073.36] P:1365.43 E:0.087008 |  of a six yard box. It's a beautiful day. Another apology of a game, unfortunately. At least the
[4073.36 - 4078.72] P:1362.60 E:0.092725 |  two other England games, you know, it's something about them, Danny. And this is what I don't understand.
[4079.28 - 4084.08] P:1419.22 E:0.087402 |  You've got nine players on the pitch. Won't really evolve in those two games.
[4084.64 - 4089.36] P:1555.81 E:0.096035 |  And now an opportunity to put a marker down. Say, look, this is what I can do at international
[4089.36 - 4093.60] P:1654.49 E:0.103148 |  level. This is what I can do at World Cup, you know, from a personal point of view, from a team
[4093.60 - 4100.00] P:1883.55 E:0.100842 |  point of view. Go out there and have a go. You know, as simple as that at the moment, it's just
[4100.00 - 4105.20] P:1798.54 E:0.085886 |  like, well, let's just see the game now. Get on the plane tomorrow and go home. You know, if they
[4105.28 - 4109.68] P:1775.95 E:0.094334 |  continue to play like this, the press back home has been vicious enough as it is.
[4110.72 - 4115.04] P:1612.98 E:0.094304 |  It's going to be even worse tomorrow if they'd have come out and had a go. Even if they've
[4115.04 - 4121.68] P:1667.22 E:0.086755 |  got beaten, I think the press would afforded a young team. A little bit of Curtis say, okay,
[4122.24 - 4127.52] P:1705.86 E:0.085658 |  inexperienced side, but had a go. Tried the right things at the moment. I'm finding
[4128.16 - 4134.24] P:1679.52 E:0.082922 |  it very, very difficult to pick out anything positive from this game. Well, I had my say about
[4134.24 - 4139.28] P:1699.22 E:0.089463 |  the criticism afforded to Steven Jarrod in some of the English news favourites this morning. But
[4139.28 - 4144.96] P:1714.75 E:0.089443 |  if they criticise this England performance, I'd be in agreement. They're so far is not a single
[4144.96 - 4149.44] P:1657.93 E:0.089071 |  redeeming feature of England's display here in the horizon. And this is what I mean. When we talk
[4149.44 - 4156.56] P:1762.56 E:0.082795 |  about identity, you say England difficult to beat, passionate, strong, robust, get the ball out wide,
[4156.56 - 4161.92] P:1820.64 E:0.091681 |  get crosses in, you know, play direct at times. There was a clear identity. You didn't need to see
[4161.92 - 4166.48] P:1754.76 E:0.083124 |  the England badge. You could watch the team play. I thought that's England as you could watch Spain
[4166.48 - 4171.04] P:1749.61 E:0.090490 |  or Brazil, you know, without the the coloured shirts and whatever it may be. And you knew what
[4171.04 - 4176.48] P:1759.35 E:0.082813 |  team was out there. You knew how they wanted to play England at the moment, whether it's confusion,
[4176.48 - 4182.88] P:1680.75 E:0.078899 |  whether they're caught, you know, in two or three minds of how to play. I don't know. But at the
[4182.88 - 4191.76] P:1675.80 E:0.083641 |  moment, it really is rock bottom. Jones aggressively tackles the Costa Rican. It wasn't a far challenge
[4191.76 - 4197.04] P:1613.88 E:0.088470 |  England had the ball lamp to Lallana in the centre of the Costa Rican half. He's got Milner
[4197.04 - 4202.56] P:1691.80 E:0.080037 |  towards this near flight. The England right. Milner moves in field. There are four white shirts
[4202.56 - 4207.76] P:1667.85 E:0.088712 |  ahead of them and he picks out Lallana. Lallana pulls the cross back but only to a red shirt.
[4208.32 - 4214.48] P:1642.55 E:0.090474 |  And he's smashed away to safety by Costa Rica. Further cleared by them, picked up by Wiltshire.
[4214.48 - 4219.44] P:1584.09 E:0.081807 |  Wiltshire with the deep cross to the far side. Brought under control, was it? Not quite under
[4219.44 - 4225.36] P:1694.57 E:0.094341 |  control. And it should be run away by Costa Rica. And needlessly, because Costa Rica were in
[4225.92 - 4230.88] P:1832.17 E:0.088336 |  fair possession, the referee blows his whistle for a free kick to Costa Rica.
[4230.88 - 4234.16] P:1785.24 E:0.098268 |  Well, Costa Rica has to be a little bit careful as well, because if they were going to go,
[4234.16 - 4239.76] P:1623.29 E:0.084558 |  if they were to go one nil behind, if they went one nil behind and then suddenly, you know,
[4239.76 - 4243.84] P:1660.41 E:0.091330 |  Italy get a goal, for instance, I think it would only one more goal after that. So I think, you
[4243.92 - 4248.96] P:1645.43 E:0.079908 |  know, Costa Rica are still going to defend properly. They are playing at 80%. You know,
[4248.96 - 4253.76] P:1619.97 E:0.088056 |  then they're not certainly they're not playing full tilt in this game. They're trying to conserve
[4253.76 - 4258.40] P:1599.01 E:0.082596 |  as much energy as possible, not getting any cards, not getting any injuries. But you know,
[4258.40 - 4262.32] P:1575.54 E:0.090250 |  they can't afford to lose this game. Yeah, if you're trying to work out the mathematics,
[4262.32 - 4266.96] P:1653.98 E:0.090828 |  obviously Costa Rica have six points at the start of this game. Italy and Uruguay,
[4266.96 - 4272.08] P:1630.98 E:0.084671 |  both three points each. In terms of goal difference, Costa Rica have plus three. Italy
[4272.88 - 4279.12] P:1516.10 E:0.088680 |  have zero their level in terms of goal difference. Uruguay minus one. So that's still an advantage
[4279.12 - 4284.24] P:1589.39 E:0.085865 |  to Costa Rica. Even should they lose this game? And there's a positive result in the other match
[4284.24 - 4291.60] P:1549.05 E:0.081540 |  in Natalic still. Italy nil, Uruguay nil. England in possession here with Frank Lampard on his last
[4291.60 - 4298.08] P:1697.46 E:0.095497 |  display for England. Flicks the pass towards the right side and Jones takes his eye off the ball
[4298.72 - 4301.60] P:1821.67 E:0.090905 |  and it bounces behind him out for a throw in. Wollful.
[4304.16 - 4309.84] P:1688.00 E:0.093643 |  I really wanted to be positive today. All these changes, as Danny's been saying,
[4309.84 - 4314.96] P:1730.16 E:0.091906 |  so many young players out there. And you can think of Jones and Smalling in defense and Sean
[4314.96 - 4320.64] P:1554.75 E:0.089278 |  defense. It's not inconceivable they will be part of England's back four in terms of the European
[4320.64 - 4327.04] P:1567.03 E:0.085240 |  Championship at France in two years time. We want to be positive that at the moment, there is no
[4327.04 - 4332.40] P:1716.18 E:0.090948 |  reason to be positive. Exactly. They're giving us no opportunity to be positive and that's the most
[4332.40 - 4339.12] P:1657.31 E:0.089634 |  disappointing thing. England now have the ball and it's over the halfway line. Sturridge furthest
[4339.12 - 4345.44] P:1677.06 E:0.087797 |  forward. It's in now to Wilshire and Wilshire. It falls over under a challenge, a third challenge,
[4345.44 - 4350.64] P:1716.53 E:0.093352 |  and he's still down in his knees. Every time Jack Wilshire goes down, you wonder is he going to get up?
[4351.60 - 4359.12] P:1628.94 E:0.083531 |  It's disperning. Diaz for Costa Rica on the near side, just chips it into the chest of Frank
[4359.12 - 4364.80] P:1558.16 E:0.084209 |  Lampard. He loses it for Jones. Back to Cahill and Cahill into Barkley on the halfway line inside
[4364.80 - 4370.88] P:1643.89 E:0.085872 |  the centre circle. Typically, he's a simple pass on to the left side of Shaw and he plays it behind
[4370.88 - 4376.80] P:1631.78 E:0.082376 |  Lookshaw. Lookshaw with Barkley available again and it goes to the Everett and Midfield play.
[4377.28 - 4382.48] P:1647.30 E:0.086329 |  Back now, the smaller. I don't know what the England fans have paid to be here,
[4382.48 - 4388.32] P:1617.94 E:0.088566 |  but they deserve better than this tepid fur from the country. Again, the ball given away
[4388.32 - 4393.44] P:1644.27 E:0.091329 |  by England. Goodness, that looked like a foul on the far side of the field. By Shaw, is that going to
[4393.44 - 4399.36] P:1690.37 E:0.088680 |  be another yellow card? England are giving the ball away under no pressure today. The Costa Ricans
[4399.36 - 4405.60] P:1715.39 E:0.089983 |  aren't really steaming in. They're not forcing England to give the ball away. England are just
[4405.60 - 4411.52] P:1551.60 E:0.089697 |  making too many unforced errors at present. This is what I said the other night. Under pressure,
[4411.52 - 4417.04] P:1611.31 E:0.091323 |  England cannot keep the ball today. They can't keep it with no pressure. I watched obviously the
[4417.04 - 4424.40] P:1805.55 E:0.098893 |  Chile, the Holland game, the Brazil game. They play at a fierce tempo at times. Really quick
[4424.40 - 4429.52] P:1656.25 E:0.089900 |  movement, really quick with the ball, but they play with ultimate quality. Look at the way Robbins
[4429.52 - 4435.84] P:1635.93 E:0.092150 |  set up the last goal on the counterattack. It was fantastic, but he got into there at full speed
[4435.84 - 4439.84] P:1599.35 E:0.094411 |  and had the composure to wrap his foot round the ball and just cut it back across goal.
[4439.84 - 4443.52] P:1477.14 E:0.093354 |  We'll get an update from Conor McNamara in Natal in a moment where it's still
[4443.52 - 4449.12] P:1587.30 E:0.091560 |  0-0 between Italy and Uruguay. Bilanus has got to come on as a substitute for Costa Rica. Rather
[4449.12 - 4454.32] P:1593.56 E:0.085986 |  a surprise that he was left out today. Costa Rica hit the fallout field, straight into England's
[4454.32 - 4460.56] P:1616.09 E:0.087505 |  possession, deep inside the England half. Let's go to Conor. Still Italy 0, Uruguay 0, with Balotelli
[4460.56 - 4466.08] P:1586.60 E:0.091689 |  going off at halftime. They've brought on a midfielder in Marco Perolo. Pat Nevins alongside me.
[4466.08 - 4472.00] P:1626.86 E:0.094775 |  0-0 will do Italy, Pat. Yes, I absolutely love that. They seem to do that. They can possibly
[4472.00 - 4476.48] P:1600.35 E:0.088697 |  break. They will break, but I did see a little bit on the darkouts are shown by Italy. There are
[4476.48 - 4482.96] P:1628.56 E:0.096194 |  no lack of hard tackles in the darkouts from the Uruguay defenders either. Suarez has not had a
[4482.96 - 4487.52] P:1859.71 E:0.092461 |  shooting opportunity in the penalty area and he's been resorted to attempting free kicks of
[4487.52 - 4492.80] P:1871.87 E:0.095745 |  goal from long range, but you feel one chance for Suarez could change everything here. Italy 0,
[4492.80 - 4498.00] P:1761.38 E:0.081092 |  Uruguay 0. Uruguay must win to be sure it going through. England have just picked up a second
[4498.00 - 4504.08] P:1479.85 E:0.093434 |  booking here. La Lana deservedly yellow carded for a crude challenge on Brande Ruiz. Goodness,
[4504.08 - 4509.04] P:1640.58 E:0.093268 |  it's going from bad to worse. 12 minutes gone in the second half. Listen to Five Live, your World Cup
[4509.12 - 4515.04] P:1723.42 E:0.091576 |  station. Brazil 2014. This is miserable fair though. Not our fault. Costa Rican ill, England
[4515.04 - 4521.20] P:1686.70 E:0.085539 |  ill. Costa Rican free kick. Played deep looking for the run of Diaz into the England penalty area,
[4521.20 - 4527.36] P:1662.32 E:0.087170 |  but it's headed away by Jones, cleared by Milner to the halfway line. Wiltshire goes down again.
[4527.36 - 4532.24] P:1772.04 E:0.084105 |  He was far tackled on this occasion. Immediately clutches the back of his right hip
[4534.64 - 4537.92] P:1672.78 E:0.105618 |  and gets to his feet finally after England have already taken the free kick.
[4538.56 - 4545.28] P:1663.00 E:0.083875 |  Here's Lampard giving away. Campbell for Costa Rica. Little bit of room inside the
[4545.28 - 4552.24] P:1594.35 E:0.087192 |  England half. Slips it forward, but that's too far away from Borges through to Ben Foster. Ben Foster
[4552.24 - 4563.52] P:1480.45 E:0.084250 |  pulls it out under R. Milanus hasn't come on. He's sat down again. So anyway, play has continued.
[4564.48 - 4569.68] P:1540.47 E:0.102753 |  13 minutes into the second half here. That's a good ball forward. Lelana is there.
[4571.44 - 4573.92] P:1645.50 E:0.094833 |  Deceptive by the dive forward by Navas the goalkeeper.
[4574.40 - 4579.68] P:1805.96 E:0.094127 |  By the first time England have got behind the Costa Rican defence, Lelana down the left hand side
[4579.68 - 4585.36] P:1699.45 E:0.089551 |  didn't quite have that final bit of quality to pick out Daniel Sturridge. Tried to roll it across
[4585.36 - 4590.08] P:1616.73 E:0.088116 |  the face of goal. Maybe just needed to dink it over top of the keeper and give Daniel Sturridge
[4590.32 - 4596.32] P:1588.04 E:0.087568 |  a head. It's chance. Milanus is waiting for the next interruption in play before the striker can
[4596.32 - 4603.36] P:1610.27 E:0.085711 |  enjoy more play with his teammates who are heading for the last 16 of the World Cup here.
[4603.36 - 4610.00] P:1613.15 E:0.087404 |  Brazil 2014 and really, you know, they're not having to use any excess energy here.
[4610.00 - 4613.28] P:1615.52 E:0.093276 |  We talk about the danger of yellow cars. Frankly, it doesn't matter for them. They haven't got a
[4613.28 - 4619.28] P:1639.11 E:0.093094 |  single player in the starting 11 on a yellow car. Now, Milanus is going to replace Drenes,
[4619.36 - 4624.96] P:1670.24 E:0.092581 |  who replaced him in the starting 11. I think Costa Rican are just trying to save legs,
[4624.96 - 4630.16] P:1677.98 E:0.093541 |  trying to save energy. It's been quite easy for them, isn't it? Back four has been untroubled.
[4630.16 - 4636.88] P:1544.75 E:0.089619 |  England have not got in behind the Costa Rican back four, back five at all. I mean, it's been far
[4636.88 - 4643.52] P:1565.57 E:0.090633 |  too easy for the Costa Rican defence. Barkley gives the ball away again. Fortunately, get it back
[4643.52 - 4648.16] P:1457.36 E:0.094421 |  on the halfway line. Find Sean the far side in the sunshine down the England left and towards
[4648.16 - 4654.32] P:1655.63 E:0.099052 |  Barkley. Barkley, oh, he was dropped down. Here's a free kick to England. It's going to be a yellow
[4654.32 - 4660.56] P:1639.73 E:0.088792 |  card for the defender Gonzalez. And here's an opportunity for Frank Lampard.
[4661.28 - 4666.56] P:1675.60 E:0.093027 |  Crew challenged by Gonzalez. Barkley picked the ball up, started running the defenders. First
[4666.56 - 4672.08] P:1680.69 E:0.089313 |  time he's really done that. Just knocked it past Gonzalez, who just left a leg there really,
[4672.08 - 4676.72] P:1546.01 E:0.091997 |  and Barkley went over it. Now, probably Frank Lampard has a decent chance from
[4678.40 - 4683.20] P:1637.20 E:0.097998 |  25 yards out. Yeah, he's got to hit the target. Test the goalkeeper. It would be fantastic for
[4683.20 - 4689.44] P:1673.94 E:0.092909 |  Frank. We'd love it. Really, as a consolation, you know, just to get him to that 30-goal mark,
[4689.44 - 4695.84] P:1649.75 E:0.088367 |  you know, on his, well, it's obviously going to be his last cap. Right. 30 minutes left for play.
[4696.40 - 4702.08] P:1581.07 E:0.095426 |  The wall has to be back the full 10 yards. Lallana's standing there as well, but it's got to be
[4702.08 - 4708.64] P:1607.08 E:0.084520 |  Lampard. Leave it to Lampard. Yes, Lallana moves slain to the left and away from the free kick.
[4708.64 - 4712.72] P:1606.88 E:0.089839 |  Here's Lampard's right foot, drill low into the wall. It's in the penalty here,
[4712.72 - 4717.20] P:1753.86 E:0.088596 |  with such disappointment again for England. Sturridge tries to weave his way into a dangerous
[4717.20 - 4724.24] P:1677.72 E:0.083391 |  area, but there's a foul on the defender. And that, oh, there's been a sending off in Natal.
[4724.24 - 4731.04] P:1779.56 E:0.096028 |  Colin McNamara. Well, this is interesting now. Italy are down to 10 men. Marchizio has been sent
[4731.04 - 4736.32] P:1807.22 E:0.094531 |  off. Claudio Marchizio, he was in possession of the ball. He tried to skip away from Iguido
[4736.32 - 4743.12] P:1716.30 E:0.088199 |  Aravallo. And as the ball was taken away from him, he stamped down on the calf of the Uruguayan,
[4743.12 - 4747.52] P:1701.87 E:0.091805 |  and the referee, Pat Nevin, showed a straight red card. It seems a little bit harsh, but the
[4747.52 - 4752.72] P:1767.04 E:0.091715 |  studs were high. He's gone over the top of the ball. It has caught the other player. And in actual
[4752.72 - 4757.28] P:1779.10 E:0.092895 |  fact, by the letter of the law, yes, you can give him a straight red for that, but there have been
[4757.36 - 4764.64] P:1848.94 E:0.098901 |  worse challenges today. What a chance for Uruguay there against 10 men now. If they can score one
[4764.64 - 4770.40] P:1847.07 E:0.089850 |  goal, it could be enough to bring them through to the last 16. Italy only need the draw, and it's
[4770.40 - 4778.32] P:1706.17 E:0.083826 |  Italy 0 Uruguay 0. 17 minutes into the second half, Roy Hodgson makes a change. Raheem Sterling
[4778.32 - 4786.24] P:1596.50 E:0.087758 |  replaces Adam Lalana. Let's see a bit more urgency. Certainly Sterling should provide that,
[4786.32 - 4790.64] P:1510.18 E:0.098036 |  but not when England give the ball away as they've done again. That's so rare, Frank Lampard, to do
[4790.64 - 4796.08] P:1734.11 E:0.088322 |  that. But not for the first time today. His pass was errant, and there's a mistake too by Jones.
[4796.08 - 4802.56] P:1790.27 E:0.093569 |  Here's the run forward by Balanas. Balanas shot is well saved, comfortably saved by Ben Foster.
[4803.52 - 4807.36] P:1778.32 E:0.088343 |  Well, luckily for Ben Foster, it was well within comfortable range
[4807.36 - 4811.28] P:1823.46 E:0.093134 |  of him, but it was a mistake by Jones, giving the ball away again unnecessarily
[4811.36 - 4816.64] P:1703.46 E:0.091595 |  to Brian Norris and Costa Rica. Serge forward on the attack, and it was a strike from
[4817.44 - 4821.36] P:1630.52 E:0.087883 |  distance. Comfortable in the end for Foster, but could have been worse.
[4821.36 - 4828.00] P:1692.00 E:0.090020 |  Sterling down the left side, on to Sterling, and Sterling midway inside the Costa Rican half.
[4828.00 - 4832.48] P:1669.44 E:0.093398 |  Oh my goodness. He's not under any pressure, and he runs the ball out of play.
[4834.96 - 4837.44] P:1605.76 E:0.103424 |  Let's get an update from Wimbledon. Russell Fuller.
[4837.44 - 4842.08] P:1682.51 E:0.087771 |  Serena Williams has taken the first set, 6-1 against Anna Tattish-Villy here on centrecourt,
[4842.08 - 4846.00] P:1582.93 E:0.091737 |  Allen while on number one court, Eugenie Bouchard leading Daniella, had to cover by
[4846.00 - 4852.08] P:1575.36 E:0.077800 |  Asset Talavich, five games all in the second. Thanks very much, Russell. You haven't missed
[4852.08 - 4858.00] P:1528.64 E:0.094978 |  anything here. Costa Rica nil, England nil on five-lie. Brando Ruiz, good ball out to the left
[4858.00 - 4863.20] P:1680.51 E:0.090847 |  side, and Balanas. Balanas looks as if he wants to make an early impact, he's running forward
[4863.20 - 4870.40] P:1615.48 E:0.085306 |  towards the penalty area. Good tackle coming in from Phil Jones, cleared by Milner, and on via
[4870.40 - 4877.92] P:1554.70 E:0.088048 |  Wiltshire to the far side through Barclay to Shaw, Shaw moves over the halfway line, pass infield
[4877.92 - 4883.84] P:1542.15 E:0.087342 |  to Raheem Sterling, and Sterling back to Lampard inside the centre circle. Wiltshire again,
[4883.84 - 4889.52] P:1501.96 E:0.089297 |  on to the right side of Milner, a storage for this forward, for England. Milner looking to find
[4889.52 - 4894.56] P:1626.64 E:0.090816 |  Wiltshire, telegraph the pass, intercepted by Costa Rica's Diaz, and run away to safety
[4894.56 - 4900.08] P:1436.27 E:0.089270 |  towards the halfway line. Balanas again, a muscle out of it by Milner, that's better.
[4900.08 - 4905.68] P:1509.83 E:0.089680 |  James Milner then gives it away. I'm glad we didn't keep a count on the number of times
[4905.68 - 4910.08] P:1457.12 E:0.100573 |  England had given the ball away, without being under undue pressure, it would be embarrassing.
[4911.68 - 4917.36] P:1631.94 E:0.093852 |  And Pat Murphy's at the cricket. The last England pair of hung on for 10 overs now, Anderson yet to
[4917.36 - 4924.24] P:1701.42 E:0.087904 |  score, Mohan Ali inside of his first test match, 100 on 96. There are 10 overs to go for Sri Lanka
[4924.24 - 4930.80] P:1476.96 E:0.081647 |  to get one more wicket. The score is irrelevant, 236 for nine. Lampard for England, back to
[4930.80 - 4936.00] P:1576.98 E:0.093266 |  Smalling, and Smalling hammers it towards the right side, accurately played to Milner.
[4936.00 - 4940.32] P:1555.57 E:0.086465 |  Milner back to Sturridge. There has been a little more urgency about England in the last few minutes.
[4940.32 - 4944.48] P:1747.60 E:0.105483 |  Sturridge and to Milner, back to Sturridge! Sturridge, shot inches wide on the far post.
[4944.56 - 4952.00] P:1716.90 E:0.094135 |  First good little bit of interchange of passing on the edge of the Costa Rican, 18-yard box.
[4952.56 - 4958.64] P:1632.37 E:0.089657 |  Sturridge, a little step over, good little one-two, kept himself on side, opened his body up,
[4958.64 - 4964.88] P:1508.30 E:0.080489 |  thinking to bend that into the far corner on his strong left foot, and missed it by about a foot.
[4965.92 - 4973.28] P:1519.48 E:0.085911 |  You know, that's been sadly the tournament for Daniel Sturridge. I think it's been difficult.
[4973.36 - 4978.32] P:1487.07 E:0.095893 |  He's had some good chances. I know he got his goal, but he really whipped that ball across.
[4979.04 - 4983.44] P:1422.81 E:0.091892 |  But when he's had those moments to hit the target, it just hasn't quite happened for him, is it?
[4984.64 - 4990.56] P:1487.72 E:0.093243 |  Well, Joel Campbell has been taken off here by Costa Rica, and he's been replaced by a defender.
[4991.12 - 5000.08] P:1514.30 E:0.082732 |  Urana, Costa Rica, just perhaps making sure that they don't lose the game. The point will ensure
[5000.16 - 5005.60] P:1525.05 E:0.084323 |  that they top the group. Remember, it's still 0-0, Italy in Uruguay, Italy down to 10 men.
[5006.32 - 5010.88] P:1543.85 E:0.091341 |  Even more intent on defending now, Italy. Balls on the halfway line with England.
[5010.88 - 5015.44] P:1576.80 E:0.085929 |  20 minutes gone in the second half. Lampard initially lost the ball, but he was helped out
[5015.44 - 5023.12] P:1549.78 E:0.084088 |  there by Barclay. Back it goes to Keir, and on now to Barclay, edge of the centre circle. Lampard.
[5023.12 - 5027.04] P:1722.58 E:0.097109 |  Barclay's getting deeper and deeper as an Allen. You know, searching for the ball, you know, trying to
[5028.00 - 5034.24] P:1693.09 E:0.090207 |  just get himself on the ball a little bit more. That's a terrible, terribly awkward
[5034.88 - 5040.48] P:1701.14 E:0.082458 |  pass from Smalling for Jones to take, and Jones couldn't control it, but Jones is back there to
[5040.48 - 5045.12] P:1619.85 E:0.087063 |  prevent any further danger for England. Retreating in toward his penalty area,
[5045.12 - 5049.44] P:1879.76 E:0.095372 |  and then spins and puts it out for a throw into Costa Rica. It's a good time to remind the listeners.
[5050.00 - 5056.72] P:1738.16 E:0.091597 |  Lyons now open for 6-0-6, 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. I'd like to hear, you know, what should England's
[5056.72 - 5062.64] P:1600.78 E:0.082298 |  identity be? Because clearly today they haven't got one. Is Roy Hodgson the right man for the job?
[5062.64 - 5067.44] P:1633.13 E:0.087310 |  If he's not, then realistically, who would you like to see as the next England manager?
[5068.48 - 5074.88] P:1553.56 E:0.091121 |  Right, Costa Rica. Give the ball away to England. Sterling to Wiltshire on the halfway line.
[5074.96 - 5079.92] P:1720.77 E:0.087535 |  Sterling's available again. There goes the pass. Wiltshire scurries past him, down the left side.
[5079.92 - 5085.60] P:1744.15 E:0.082688 |  Sterling looks infield instead to Sturridge back towards Sterling, headed clear by Costa Rica.
[5085.60 - 5090.00] P:1629.69 E:0.085800 |  Was that a hand up by Jack Wiltshire? It was, and it's a free kick to Costa Rica.
[5090.88 - 5094.56] P:1760.60 E:0.091675 |  I think Jack Wiltshire tried to get his hands out the way, sort of held his hands up
[5095.12 - 5098.48] P:1651.12 E:0.091662 |  to say, look, I don't want to handball it, but it did hit his hand. Stopped the ball from going
[5098.48 - 5102.40] P:1659.97 E:0.090238 |  forward in a free kick, and chance for Costa Rica to slow the game down again.
[5102.40 - 5107.04] P:1776.19 E:0.099157 |  Some quick news from Conor in the towel. Well, there's been a huge chance for Louis Suarez
[5107.04 - 5112.48] P:1773.70 E:0.095121 |  and Uruguay. Still 0-0. Cavani threaded the ball through. Suarez in the penalty area,
[5112.48 - 5117.28] P:1879.17 E:0.085554 |  toe poked it, and Gianluigi Buffon made a very important save. Pat Nevin.
[5117.28 - 5122.00] P:1867.62 E:0.090493 |  Do you know what? If you want one team, and that's all planted to save you with 10-0,
[5122.00 - 5125.84] P:1781.12 E:0.098186 |  it's Sterling. They're standing in front of me right now. They've got every chance to do it,
[5125.84 - 5130.88] P:1758.52 E:0.091382 |  but they will be under pressure. 10-man Italy-0. Uruguay-0 at the moment. Italy go through.
[5131.68 - 5137.68] P:1629.51 E:0.089273 |  And it's 0-0 here in Bellahorazonte between Costa Rica and England, midway through the second half
[5137.68 - 5141.52] P:1652.81 E:0.085418 |  to administer the last right for England's World Cup. Mike Ng.
[5142.48 - 5146.72] P:1712.62 E:0.097555 |  Thank you, Alan. And I think I can't remember what was Daniel Chris said earlier in the program,
[5146.72 - 5150.72] P:1682.90 E:0.092650 |  that what we're looking at, and particularly now Sterling is on, is we're looking really at the
[5150.72 - 5156.08] P:1657.34 E:0.087980 |  nucleus of the team England would expect to field in two years' time. Probably World Cup will come
[5156.08 - 5160.80] P:1656.41 E:0.091934 |  into it, and maybe Young Stones as well. But there's a big strong nucleus there of players
[5160.80 - 5165.52] P:1625.37 E:0.088824 |  that Roy Hodgson would be hoping to take to France. It's better for England in the second half.
[5165.52 - 5170.64] P:1626.98 E:0.096636 |  Costa Rica filtering players back inside their own half once more, and we're looking at
[5170.64 - 5175.20] P:1735.80 E:0.094795 |  Schor over on the left-hand side, making a mistake, and Costa Rica coming on a break, playing it
[5176.24 - 5180.48] P:1615.02 E:0.096689 |  rather halfheartedly for themselves towards Arena, who's come on for Campbell.
[5181.20 - 5184.32] P:1618.93 E:0.094027 |  But the fact that they've taken Campbell off now as well, I think they've probably
[5184.40 - 5188.40] P:1551.85 E:0.090643 |  got one eye on their last 16 game. They don't know who they'll be playing yet, of course.
[5188.40 - 5192.08] P:1626.11 E:0.104885 |  England nil, Costa Rica nil. Nil-nil between Italy and Uruguay.
[5192.80 - 5197.20] P:1738.92 E:0.093322 |  Sturridge gives chase. He was so close to scoring in this game in the second half,
[5197.20 - 5200.96] P:1583.38 E:0.095446 |  Costa Rica just lumped the ball out of defence. But remember, if Italy go through,
[5200.96 - 5204.32] P:1688.35 E:0.087923 |  Marquisio will be out of the game, and so too will Balotelli.
[5204.32 - 5207.92] P:1532.60 E:0.099543 |  Marquisio has been sent off. Balotelli's picked up his second yellow card.
[5209.36 - 5212.64] P:1823.09 E:0.097279 |  England now with Sterling. Forward for Sturridge.
[5212.64 - 5218.48] P:1811.12 E:0.101008 |  Sturridge has a chance to run up the Costa Rican goal. Sturridge goes forward, and he's won a corner.
[5218.48 - 5223.04] P:1802.73 E:0.091039 |  The defender had a bit of a hack really at him as well, could easily have conceded a penalty,
[5223.84 - 5227.04] P:1749.79 E:0.091493 |  but the ball has gone out of play, and England have a corner far side.
[5227.84 - 5230.96] P:1796.01 E:0.097733 |  I thought Sturridge was in. Clearly going to have a shot on goal.
[5231.76 - 5237.04] P:1789.61 E:0.088340 |  Just had a little bit of hesitation. It doesn't seem to have that sharpness, that confidence
[5237.04 - 5241.84] P:1572.82 E:0.086982 |  to run up people. It wasn't a penalty. He allowed the defender to get back. He got a touch on the
[5241.84 - 5246.96] P:1502.95 E:0.084998 |  ball, and then he went over. Good referee in. But he was ahead of the defender, wasn't he?
[5246.96 - 5250.56] P:1514.34 E:0.091666 |  He allowed the defender to get back. We haven't seen that for Liverpool this season.
[5250.56 - 5255.44] P:1719.69 E:0.087118 |  The game is there for England to win. It's 0-0 against Costa Rica. England have a corner kick
[5255.44 - 5259.60] P:1560.96 E:0.094569 |  over on the far side, which Barclay will take. It's the usual pushing and shoving going on in
[5259.60 - 5264.88] P:1519.92 E:0.097026 |  the penalty area. Cahill trying to get away from his marker, and in goes the corner kick.
[5264.88 - 5266.80] P:1886.88 E:0.089422 |  Out comes the keeper. Gets a good fist to it.
[5266.80 - 5271.12] P:1885.54 E:0.083135 |  Wilshard tries to pick up the loose ball on the edge of the area. Costa Rica don't clear.
[5271.12 - 5277.04] P:1820.37 E:0.080155 |  Wilshard's taken another knock, and now Sterling's made a mistake. But Costa Rica
[5277.04 - 5281.36] P:1738.08 E:0.095077 |  only a reiner at the moment in possession. But the ball will go down to Ruiz now over on that
[5281.36 - 5286.16] P:1707.05 E:0.087129 |  right-hand side of the field. There's danger here for Costa Rica. For England, they get the cross in,
[5286.16 - 5291.52] P:1725.33 E:0.090260 |  and Sterling's challenge was late. Ball's gone behind that. Danny's been talking about this
[5292.24 - 5296.48] P:1704.88 E:0.099030 |  for some time now. This turnover. When England are in attack, they lose possession, and suddenly
[5296.48 - 5300.40] P:1545.67 E:0.090983 |  Costa Rica break, and they win a corner over on the far side. Well, well then, Raheem Sterling
[5300.40 - 5304.08] P:1689.98 E:0.085327 |  for chasing back. I think he was lucky not to give away a free kick. But Jack Wilshard's
[5304.08 - 5310.32] P:1514.37 E:0.094487 |  gone down again. Every single... I don't want to pick on the player, but every single time he gets
[5310.32 - 5316.08] P:1508.42 E:0.093196 |  tackled, he goes down for a length of time. I don't know whether this is a mental issue,
[5316.08 - 5321.60] P:1604.69 E:0.092805 |  whether it's a physical issue, I'm not sure. Costa Rica corner. Far side. Foster's not got it first
[5321.60 - 5327.60] P:1654.75 E:0.083601 |  time, but the whistle's going to go against the Costa Rican, and we'll go down to Ian Dennis Pickside.
[5327.68 - 5331.52] P:1379.50 E:0.100207 |  Stephen Gerrard's coming on, Mike. He's just been warming up behind this goal that I'm sat behind
[5331.52 - 5336.56] P:1429.63 E:0.089287 |  Pickside here for five lives. He's just gone down to the tunnel. He's quickly emerged, and Stephen
[5336.56 - 5343.28] P:1219.68 E:0.093220 |  Gerrard, possibly maybe for the last time, is 114th cap for his country, and also sat in front of
[5343.28 - 5348.16] P:1278.78 E:0.089664 |  this England support. The England fans behind me are the only bright spot from this thoroughly
[5348.16 - 5354.08] P:1569.62 E:0.090298 |  frustrating afternoon. Their support has been awesome. Well, I wonder what we read into this,
[5354.16 - 5359.12] P:1562.83 E:0.088133 |  this moment where Gerrard will come on to win his 114th cap. It's one behind David Beckham.
[5359.84 - 5364.16] P:1638.55 E:0.100481 |  He'll join Frank Lampard, or maybe Lampard will come off. We'll wait and see, but Gerrard is being
[5364.16 - 5370.56] P:1523.67 E:0.091328 |  prepared, and James Milner, we feel, is the player who's going to make way. England nil,
[5370.56 - 5374.72] P:1745.91 E:0.095865 |  Costa Rica nil. England have been better in the last 10 minutes. Sturridge really should have done
[5374.72 - 5380.96] P:1634.74 E:0.082984 |  better. Gerrard is waiting to come on. I'll get Danny to try and interpret this introduction of
[5380.96 - 5385.68] P:1630.60 E:0.091771 |  Stephen Gerrard in a moment. Borough Frecaforza is not going to get on the pitch this World Cup,
[5385.68 - 5391.36] P:1638.19 E:0.094010 |  and now Costa Rica with Boulanas juggling with the ball, and then Diaz finds Boulanas once more,
[5392.00 - 5396.32] P:1657.53 E:0.096276 |  and the ball will go to the far side, and there's lots of space down that right hand side now for
[5396.32 - 5401.36] P:1675.55 E:0.097794 |  Gamboa. Plays it short to Brian Ruiz, England on the back foot here. Ruiz ball into the area,
[5401.36 - 5405.92] P:1642.09 E:0.088627 |  not cleared yet, and now it's lumped to safety over on the far side, and now we wonder whether
[5406.00 - 5412.64] P:1697.37 E:0.088743 |  this might be the last time we see Stephen Gerrard. He's coming on for Jack Wilshire, who got the injury
[5413.84 - 5421.36] P:1699.37 E:0.099000 |  a few moments ago. So Wilshire says farewell to the World Cup. Danny, the official word is that
[5421.36 - 5426.00] P:1734.48 E:0.092528 |  neither Roy Hodgson nor Stephen Gerrard know exactly what lies in store, but he's coming on.
[5426.00 - 5430.96] P:1800.15 E:0.096921 |  Would you, any interpretation? Well, I think he's given him the chance that this may well be
[5431.04 - 5436.56] P:1773.35 E:0.095397 |  his swanson. I think that'll be, he's given him the opportunity. Okay, the back end of the season,
[5436.56 - 5441.76] P:1841.30 E:0.103478 |  we know, didn't go quite as well as he wanted it to. The two England games haven't gone as expected,
[5441.76 - 5447.44] P:1882.34 E:0.090931 |  but he has been a magnificent servant over the years for England, and I think this will be an
[5447.44 - 5454.16] P:1798.34 E:0.086456 |  opportunity, may well be his last game, and I think first and foremost he can raise those last two
[5454.16 - 5459.60] P:1645.02 E:0.080194 |  games, if you like, hopefully go out on a little bit of positive, applaud the fans after the end of
[5459.60 - 5464.16] P:1615.92 E:0.083033 |  the game, haven't actually played a part in the game. Well, that was well won by England at the
[5464.16 - 5469.68] P:1715.93 E:0.093710 |  back, Jones. Milner, though, is easily pushed aside down this near side by Borges, who's a really
[5469.68 - 5475.28] P:1676.74 E:0.082364 |  strong player in midfield, and now that's a good ball played forward by Takeda and Costa Rica,
[5475.28 - 5479.84] P:1655.53 E:0.090289 |  who have revived themselves. Get the ball in from the far side of the field and England header,
[5479.84 - 5484.32] P:1730.41 E:0.084356 |  it's not gone for a corner. Smalling has to be careful with his clearance, Barkley on the edge
[5484.40 - 5490.24] P:1730.40 E:0.087845 |  of the area, and then Shaw, and Takeda was late on Shaw as he cleared. Well, England fans will know
[5490.24 - 5496.00] P:1573.76 E:0.089502 |  that for the last decade or so there's always been talk of the fact that suggestions that Lampard
[5496.00 - 5501.68] P:1658.81 E:0.095387 |  and Gerrard can't play together in the same England team, well now they are possibly finishing their
[5501.68 - 5507.04] P:1617.36 E:0.089889 |  England careers together on the field here at the World Cup, and they're going to have over 15 minutes
[5507.04 - 5513.12] P:1816.41 E:0.089444 |  to enjoy themselves. And Frank Lampard has just given Stephen Gerrard the armband, maybe a little
[5513.20 - 5520.00] P:1707.58 E:0.083578 |  bit belatedly, obviously, easing the captain a decent gesture from Frank Lampard. Well, he said
[5520.00 - 5526.16] P:1598.11 E:0.088629 |  Stephen Gerrard to us, talking to Ian Dennis that he was broken and hurt, and really hurting
[5526.16 - 5531.52] P:1719.61 E:0.093710 |  after what had happened in the first two games. Can he just sign off here with something special
[5531.52 - 5535.92] P:1764.84 E:0.094940 |  for England? Back again to Pat Murphy at the Test match. The last pair are still together,
[5535.92 - 5542.24] P:1810.02 E:0.083984 |  Anderson's still on Nort, he's faced 35 balls, Mohin's stuck on 96, he's got that conundrum,
[5542.24 - 5548.40] P:1841.83 E:0.077546 |  does he stick or twist? Can he get that extra four for his first Test match century? Eight overs to
[5548.40 - 5554.32] P:1757.70 E:0.083348 |  go, Anderson and Panasar batted through 13 to save the Test against Australian Cardiff. This would
[5554.32 - 5559.68] P:1733.65 E:0.086282 |  mean these two would go through 20 overs to save this match. They've gone through 12, eight to go,
[5559.68 - 5564.32] P:1691.64 E:0.087820 |  236 for nine, Mike. Thank you, Pat. You're listening to Five Live from Bella Horizonte,
[5564.32 - 5568.48] P:1797.56 E:0.096611 |  England nil, Costa Rica nil, Sterling goes down that far side, the field fed by Sturridge,
[5568.48 - 5572.72] P:1763.58 E:0.095978 |  he'll just keep the ball in by the corner flag and in the end wins the corner. We'll go to Ian
[5572.72 - 5576.88] P:1716.52 E:0.093490 |  Dennis in a moment pitch side. I said to Danny a few moments ago we could be looking at the
[5576.88 - 5581.52] P:1636.55 E:0.091034 |  England team in two years time on the pitch, not now. We've got Lampard and Gerrard together in
[5581.52 - 5586.40] P:1759.15 E:0.098095 |  midfield and Gerrard is going to take this England corner and he sluts the England fans
[5586.40 - 5591.36] P:1781.99 E:0.095113 |  over on the far side who are giving the team incredible support under the circumstances.
[5592.32 - 5598.24] P:1542.84 E:0.099219 |  Gerrard now with his England corner kick nil nil against Costa Rica and here comes the corner
[5598.40 - 5602.80] P:1695.49 E:0.089350 |  whipped in by the captain to the far post and Lampard off balance couldn't get it forward
[5602.80 - 5606.96] P:1635.79 E:0.086969 |  and here's Ian Dennis pitch side. Yeah, that was a terrific ovation for Stephen Gerrard as he went
[5606.96 - 5610.80] P:1356.48 E:0.094189 |  to take that corner kick and England are about to make their third and final substitution.
[5610.80 - 5614.16] P:1302.06 E:0.094629 |  We've had Sterling, we've had Gerrard now, and to Wayne Rooney.
[5616.16 - 5624.08] P:1887.62 E:0.097738 |  Indeed, Wayne Rooney is coming on for James Milner. So Milner and Wilshire have been replaced.
[5624.48 - 5632.08] P:1840.07 E:0.097760 |  Sterling is on for the Lana. On comes Wayne Rooney who at last has scored of course at a World Cup
[5632.08 - 5638.88] P:1870.76 E:0.088851 |  in that game against Uruguay and Rooney comes on to win his 95th cap and like Luis Suarez in that
[5638.88 - 5646.16] P:1782.72 E:0.087261 |  game scored his 40th international goal as well. England nil Costa Rica nil. Scoreline stay like
[5646.16 - 5652.08] P:1786.14 E:0.083326 |  this then Costa Rica top the group. Italy will finish second. That Italy down to 10 men against
[5652.16 - 5656.72] P:1770.15 E:0.086435 |  Uruguay drawing nil nil. Marquisio having been sent off and here's a well we've got a Conor
[5656.72 - 5660.56] P:1761.32 E:0.089518 |  McNamara in a minute just England building in front of us down the right hand side. Sterling's
[5660.56 - 5665.12] P:1692.19 E:0.087599 |  come across to the right. So England have Rooney on, they have Gerrard on, they have Sterling on
[5665.12 - 5669.44] P:1746.69 E:0.090385 |  as well. Lampard's trying to win the ball in midfield but now Boulanas gets Costa Rica out of
[5669.44 - 5675.52] P:1611.77 E:0.084176 |  their own half and the ball is played back to Ben Foster. Costa Rica will make a change in a moment.
[5675.52 - 5680.48] P:1648.61 E:0.096669 |  Let's go back to that Uruguay-Italy game and Conor McNamara. Still scoreless Italy now playing
[5680.48 - 5685.84] P:1745.95 E:0.092588 |  with a flat back five as they look to hold on with the 10 men against Uruguay here. We've had a
[5685.84 - 5690.96] P:1748.74 E:0.089773 |  long delay for an injury to Verati which could stretch us into several minutes of injury time at
[5690.96 - 5695.68] P:1663.96 E:0.092199 |  the end and Pat Nevin alongside me. Uruguay have got to get it to Suarez in the penalty area.
[5695.68 - 5698.96] P:1559.33 E:0.097966 |  Yeah and Suarez is just going up. He's playing against three or four defenders so he's not
[5698.96 - 5703.76] P:1621.24 E:0.082270 |  getting much space. It's a tackle against defense. Italy aren't even attempting the attack now.
[5703.76 - 5707.60] P:1812.14 E:0.099111 |  Mott has come on as another defender. Here's a chance but they can't get to it. The Uruguay
[5707.60 - 5713.04] P:1692.49 E:0.087603 |  winds up in the penalty area. Italy clear away. Italy 0. Uruguay 0. Michael Barantes will come on
[5713.04 - 5717.92] P:1616.56 E:0.088283 |  in a moment for Costa Rica but what's already grabbed my attention. Gerard's only been on the
[5717.92 - 5722.24] P:1700.65 E:0.090123 |  field three or four minutes but he's already trying to get forward. There's so much of the
[5722.24 - 5726.56] P:1626.98 E:0.093473 |  season of course he's had this anchor role. He's playing alongside Frank Lampard but Lampard
[5726.56 - 5732.56] P:1635.58 E:0.092988 |  seems to be the man sitting and Gerard is the man making the runs. So Barantes comes on for
[5732.64 - 5738.56] P:1601.13 E:0.089043 |  Costa Rica. He comes on for Borges and we have less than 15 minutes to go. Danny Mills. Well I
[5738.56 - 5743.20] P:1530.57 E:0.094297 |  think Stephen Gerard probably wants to finish on a high. Very very disappointed up until now
[5743.20 - 5747.60] P:1538.74 E:0.088552 |  in obviously with this World Cup. He'll want to go out with a decent performance. Maybe even nick
[5747.60 - 5752.72] P:1601.67 E:0.087679 |  himself a goal and give the fans something to cheer about. But not just on that. Obviously a
[5752.72 - 5759.68] P:1558.24 E:0.089978 |  reminder that the lines are open for 606. 0.500. 909. 6.93. Where do England go from here? What is
[5759.68 - 5766.16] P:1585.14 E:0.085255 |  their identity and if Roy Hodgson isn't the right man for the job then realistically who do you
[5766.16 - 5771.44] P:1641.74 E:0.088445 |  think it should be? Well Costa Rica haven't turned on the style today that they showed against Italy
[5771.44 - 5776.72] P:1699.54 E:0.091548 |  in Uruguay but of course those six points have already put them through. Long ball from Stephen
[5776.72 - 5781.68] P:1688.09 E:0.096242 |  Gerard and what a ball it was. He finds Raheem Sterling down on this right hand side. Rooney's
[5781.68 - 5786.24] P:1643.23 E:0.085784 |  calling for the ball and Sterling didn't deliver it. Sterling should have done that earlier
[5786.24 - 5790.24] P:1602.24 E:0.093560 |  and Costa Rica clear. They're only leaving one man down field at the moment. They're very much
[5790.24 - 5795.52] P:1655.63 E:0.092809 |  playing for this draw. Costa Rica they will know what's going on in the game running simultaneously
[5795.52 - 5801.84] P:1565.75 E:0.093129 |  Uruguay 0. Italy 0 in Natal. And at the moment Costa Rica are sort of inviting England onto them
[5801.84 - 5806.96] P:1546.91 E:0.086967 |  really. Shore over on the left hand side. Barclay calling for it. England sense that they could at
[5806.96 - 5810.56] P:1828.65 E:0.096111 |  least get a victory here today. Gerard again looking to release Sterling down this nizzle.
[5810.56 - 5815.60] P:1724.32 E:0.091375 |  It's another great ball from Gerard and this time Sterling lays it off to Sturridge. Rooney wants
[5815.60 - 5820.56] P:1684.89 E:0.088288 |  the ball square. He's played into trouble though. There were too many defenders around him and
[5820.56 - 5826.88] P:1634.54 E:0.092706 |  there's Costa Rica try and break. They don't play it well enough to Balaanus and out comes Ben Foster,
[5826.88 - 5831.76] P:1589.46 E:0.089858 |  an England builder game from the back. We have to remember though English forwards has been a little
[5831.76 - 5838.16] P:1526.12 E:0.092216 |  bit better in the second half. Costa Rica happy with the draw. Rooney on the chest. Wayne Rooney
[5838.16 - 5843.92] P:1705.24 E:0.099674 |  half thought about a shot. Now he tries to take the goalkeeper and the goalkeeper saw that coming
[5843.92 - 5848.08] P:1692.77 E:0.097315 |  waited for it to come down. It tipped it over the bar. England playing their best football of the
[5848.08 - 5853.04] P:1626.80 E:0.094549 |  game at least. Ending this world cup with a little bit of a flourish but it's 0-0 here on 5-5.
[5853.04 - 5858.64] P:1619.14 E:0.089491 |  England have a corner kick over on the far side. What would be very interesting of course in this
[5858.64 - 5864.64] P:1645.36 E:0.093024 |  game would be if there was a score in the Uruguay-Italy game. How that would affect the Costa
[5864.64 - 5870.40] P:1529.12 E:0.091403 |  Ricans down. They want to win the group. Corner kick to England. Far side. Their left hand side.
[5870.96 - 5875.44] P:1553.06 E:0.101852 |  Cahill's made a run to the far post and it goes. Goalkeeper fisted out. Again not a good set piece
[5875.44 - 5881.12] P:1669.28 E:0.096450 |  from England and Sterling gives chase over on the far side but he hasn't got... Oh he's lucky a
[5881.12 - 5885.28] P:1631.32 E:0.089948 |  little bit there Sterling because the Costa Ricans has been penalised and England have a free kick.
[5885.28 - 5887.60] P:1659.91 E:0.108727 |  I think we might be going to corner in a minute. There's been a bit of a melee
[5888.88 - 5894.00] P:1740.27 E:0.095320 |  in the... Well Keeleney's moaning about something. He's showing everybody his shoulder. He's pulled
[5894.00 - 5898.96] P:1626.26 E:0.093840 |  his shirt down. It was a little bit of an elbow thrown by him. He was involved with Louis Suarez,
[5899.68 - 5905.36] P:1553.33 E:0.076747 |  Pugatch is maddened to me. Not quite sure what have happened but... Well...
[5907.44 - 5911.36] P:1774.85 E:0.107641 |  Wayne Rooney bursting down the England right hand side. We'll go to the Italy Uruguay game
[5911.36 - 5915.36] P:1688.54 E:0.086005 |  in a moment. We'll go now because that move is broken down. Let's go to Conor McNamara.
[5915.36 - 5921.60] P:1882.55 E:0.098182 |  Oh Mike there is high controversy here. Louis Suarez has collided with Keeleney the Italian
[5921.60 - 5927.60] P:1908.42 E:0.090613 |  defender. Now from a distance it looks like a headbutt on Keeleney's shoulder but Keeleney is
[5927.60 - 5934.48] P:1850.86 E:0.090209 |  suggesting that Louis Suarez has bit him. Now we know that there is history in this with Louis
[5934.48 - 5941.36] P:1871.28 E:0.091693 |  Suarez. Keeleney pulled his jersey off his shoulder pointing to his teeth and pointing to his
[5941.36 - 5945.92] P:1812.54 E:0.095394 |  shoulder and Louis Suarez as he was recovering did have his mouth open and was rubbing his
[5945.92 - 5951.20] P:1755.30 E:0.094364 |  fingers inside his mouth as if he had hurt his teeth. We've yet to see conclusive evidence
[5951.20 - 5958.32] P:1834.64 E:0.092740 |  that he did bite him but what a story with Louis Suarez back involved and the accusation from a
[5958.32 - 5964.64] P:1712.73 E:0.080113 |  defender that Suarez has bit him. From what I've seen Mike that's a bite. The action I've only seen
[5964.64 - 5971.20] P:1634.39 E:0.087538 |  it from behind from one angle but his movement with his head is not a headbutt. For me that looks
[5971.20 - 5976.40] P:1696.32 E:0.086442 |  like a bite. If it is I'm sorry but that has to be the longest ban on the planet.
[5977.28 - 5982.32] P:1759.48 E:0.098936 |  Because of his history we must go back to Conor. Conor joined us straight away from the town.
[5982.32 - 5991.68] P:1822.95 E:0.102930 |  Go for Uruguay who leads 10 men Italy. Diego Gordine has scored from the corner just after
[5991.68 - 6001.60] P:1779.15 E:0.096992 |  Louis Suarez appeared to bite the Italian defender Keeleney and in the immediate aftermath of all
[6001.60 - 6009.76] P:1821.20 E:0.095157 |  of that Uruguay score and there's shades here of South Africa four years ago when Louis Suarez
[6009.76 - 6016.40] P:1802.46 E:0.091143 |  handled deliberately on the line and then the penalty was saved and the Uruguayans went through.
[6016.40 - 6024.80] P:1929.53 E:0.092597 |  Here Suarez has appeared to bite Keeleney and in the confusing aftermath the Italians have conceded
[6024.80 - 6032.40] P:1896.67 E:0.091613 |  at the set piece and it's the captain Diego Gordine it's Italy Neal, Uruguay won as things
[6032.40 - 6037.92] P:1832.74 E:0.095592 |  stand Pat Nevin, Italy are going out of the World Cup. You know they've defended so much and so well
[6037.92 - 6043.44] P:1656.10 E:0.093108 |  for most of this game but they were using a kept on saying the dark cars however the dark cars used
[6043.44 - 6049.52] P:1654.45 E:0.089645 |  against them there. Now whether or not Suarez has actually bit him he at least headbutted the defender.
[6049.52 - 6054.64] P:1664.09 E:0.092364 |  He's had to take a lot of stick all the way through the game but you cannot do that in particular
[6054.72 - 6060.56] P:1755.84 E:0.095047 |  if you hit Louis Suarez you cannot do that. It's a brilliant header from Gordine, it's a hugely
[6060.56 - 6067.52] P:1867.17 E:0.095666 |  important goal for Uruguay and their supporters are celebrating now against 10 men Uruguay
[6067.52 - 6072.96] P:1858.10 E:0.095663 |  lead Italy by a goal to Neal but we are going to be hearing about Louis Suarez and this alleged
[6072.96 - 6077.52] P:1830.51 E:0.091736 |  bite for a long time to come. Well we're watching England here but we're completely distracted
[6077.52 - 6081.44] P:1880.25 E:0.097525 |  now by what's going on in that particular game. That score line doesn't affect Costa Rica by the
[6081.44 - 6086.56] P:1752.93 E:0.091246 |  way at all. Costa Rica will still win the group. I'm intrigued by the fact that there'd be no
[6086.56 - 6093.28] P:1763.11 E:0.093420 |  replay shown of that incident. I mean that maybe tells a story. No replay shown and what about
[6093.28 - 6099.44] P:1762.15 E:0.097812 |  Gordine by the way? It was Gordine's header which won Atletico Madrid the La Liga against Barcelona
[6099.44 - 6104.24] P:1755.81 E:0.090414 |  in the New Camp and there he is today popping up to score the goal which could well take Uruguay
[6104.24 - 6110.80] P:1786.40 E:0.091800 |  into the last 16 and remember Uruguay began this competition without Suarez losing 3-1 to Costa Rica.
[6110.80 - 6114.00] P:1689.57 E:0.086925 |  Well sorry mate, we make no apologies for not talking about the England game because nothing's
[6114.00 - 6120.24] P:1585.74 E:0.082830 |  happening. When you look at this I'm just looking down, I think I'm Mark Buge's iPad.
[6121.44 - 6124.88] P:1536.49 E:0.097965 |  That looks like a bite to me. It's very very difficult to see behind but that looks like a
[6124.88 - 6130.56] P:1760.74 E:0.091870 |  definite movement towards the bite Kylini. Kylian was absolutely fuming. He threw out his arm immediately
[6130.56 - 6137.84] P:1587.48 E:0.081512 |  to elbow him and rightly so. If that's a bite that has to be the longest band in football ever
[6137.84 - 6144.56] P:1769.22 E:0.090574 |  and a worldwide band, not just an international band because that is absolutely disgraceful if
[6144.56 - 6148.88] P:1754.92 E:0.094098 |  that's the case. Well here in this game it's Nill Nill and Bellanas is trying to go forward for
[6148.88 - 6154.40] P:1762.45 E:0.088678 |  Costa Rica. More on that at Suarez in a moment. Here's Pat Murphy in the cricket. England have only
[6154.40 - 6161.68] P:1755.62 E:0.082968 |  34 balls to survive. Anderson still hasn't scored, 39 balls he's faced but Mohen Alley has his century
[6161.68 - 6167.60] P:1548.81 E:0.085263 |  in his second test match. Magnificent performance, 247 for nine. I'm going to see two draws
[6167.60 - 6173.12] P:1603.79 E:0.084550 |  involving England at exactly the same time today. Thank you very much indeed Pat. No biting there
[6173.12 - 6178.24] P:1607.75 E:0.099496 |  then but we must go back to Conor because it's England Nill, Costa Rica Nill here but it's all
[6178.24 - 6183.60] P:1801.95 E:0.098442 |  happening in Natal, Italy and Uruguay. Conor McNamara. Free kick for Italy. Pirlo hits it through
[6183.60 - 6191.20] P:1877.49 E:0.091714 |  the wall and only just wide. It took a deflection on the way through and the Italians now scurry
[6191.20 - 6195.76] P:1748.53 E:0.091292 |  over to take a quarter. They are down to 10 men. They're on their way out of the World Cup and
[6195.76 - 6200.48] P:1925.45 E:0.095545 |  they're furious about it particularly with the man on the ball now Suarez who tries to come away.
[6200.48 - 6206.24] P:1816.60 E:0.087416 |  Cassano though tackles him and has played long into the penalty area again and the Italians
[6206.24 - 6211.92] P:1777.55 E:0.091150 |  can't get hold of it and they defended all the game pattern and now the Italians have to push
[6211.92 - 6217.36] P:1818.84 E:0.096835 |  forward and that's going to create space and he's gassed on Ramirez. Brilliant tackle on the
[6217.36 - 6221.92] P:1610.91 E:0.094319 |  edge of the penalty area. Absolutely fantastic. This game is not going to end quietly. It's
[6221.92 - 6226.32] P:1593.75 E:0.091904 |  absolutely mayhem now. The Italians are just throwing everyone. It's a completely and utterly
[6226.32 - 6230.80] P:1626.81 E:0.084973 |  opening game. They're opening game here and they have to attack but they haven't given many attackers
[6230.80 - 6234.96] P:1723.71 E:0.086964 |  on the field. They've taken most of them off the field now so they'll go for it. They're trying to
[6234.96 - 6239.44] P:1614.18 E:0.084718 |  get free kicks, corner kicks and maybe trying to attack them from there but what they're doing is
[6239.44 - 6244.48] P:1639.64 E:0.091076 |  they're leaving space at the back and you just you will not be surprised if Loew Suarez gets at
[6244.48 - 6248.56] P:1739.13 E:0.098501 |  least a chance between now and the end of the game. This is five line from the BBC in Natal
[6248.56 - 6254.48] P:1716.56 E:0.095621 |  where it is Italy nil. Uruguay won the goal scored by the Uruguayan captain Gaudin but all the
[6254.48 - 6261.68] P:1858.99 E:0.093657 |  controversy here about what looks to be yet another bite by Loew Suarez on the flesh of an
[6261.68 - 6268.32] P:1761.58 E:0.099038 |  opponent. The experienced Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini who was incensed. The two players came
[6268.32 - 6274.24] P:1696.66 E:0.091075 |  together. Chiellini sitting on the ground went perplexed towards the referee and pointing to
[6274.24 - 6281.28] P:1766.09 E:0.090821 |  his shoulder and pulling down the jersey to show you know presumably teat marks from where Suarez
[6281.28 - 6285.92] P:1685.13 E:0.094195 |  had this alleged bite on him and we want to be careful here. We've not seen an angle that
[6285.92 - 6292.72] P:1781.23 E:0.092747 |  absolutely confirms it but it does appear that Loew Suarez has bitten Chiellini and then immediately
[6292.72 - 6298.08] P:1798.03 E:0.092234 |  afterwards the Uruguayan scored down the other end here. Casano tries to thread a ball to Thiago
[6298.08 - 6303.12] P:1724.72 E:0.091055 |  Mota but he can't pick out his fellow Italian in the penalty area and it goes out for a throw in
[6303.12 - 6308.40] P:1807.33 E:0.091202 |  on the far side and the Uruguayans will take their time over. They're suddenly having chased the game
[6308.40 - 6315.04] P:1836.01 E:0.090682 |  for Silla. Nil Nil was no good to Uruguay but now they've got their noses in front and as things stand
[6315.04 - 6321.04] P:1778.48 E:0.094205 |  Costa Rica who are still nil nil with England and Uruguay will be going through out of this group
[6321.04 - 6327.04] P:1803.36 E:0.085233 |  and the two former winners of the World Cup Italy and England will be going out. Here is Pirlo on
[6327.04 - 6331.44] P:1698.37 E:0.097662 |  the ball midway inside the Uruguayan half on the right hand side scoops it into the penalty area
[6331.44 - 6336.24] P:1828.99 E:0.090429 |  Casano controls he's got his back to goal he's been ushered out of the penalty area just well
[6336.24 - 6342.00] P:1842.96 E:0.092324 |  to conjure any sort of a cross-up but it's intercepted and Aravalo should be able to clear it away
[6342.00 - 6347.44] P:1737.09 E:0.090657 |  takes his time and eventually they clear it and it goes out for a throw into Uruguay. Pat Neville.
[6347.44 - 6352.16] P:1610.44 E:0.100058 |  Yeah well and to be absolutely fair in Loew Suarez you're right we don't know absolutely if he's
[6352.16 - 6358.00] P:1609.07 E:0.092293 |  bitten the player but he has attempted to use his head on him he only reached the shoulder of Chiellini
[6358.08 - 6363.52] P:1515.07 E:0.087595 |  but you're not allowed to do that anyway put that in context he's had rough house tactics on him
[6363.52 - 6368.00] P:1294.69 E:0.095763 |  from all those three centre-backs all afternoon continually they've been pulling them they've
[6368.00 - 6372.32] P:1483.49 E:0.093658 |  been jumping into them they've been tackling from the back he has had a really hard time and he's
[6372.32 - 6377.04] P:1462.86 E:0.099356 |  trying to hold it and hold it and hold it but obviously he's let go there and you just cannot
[6377.04 - 6381.76] P:1433.72 E:0.097277 |  let that happen. Having said that it's still excitement here there's only a few minutes to go
[6381.76 - 6386.88] P:1560.38 E:0.094290 |  anything could happen but Italy have to go for it. Well Felicitas at home it's an incredible atmosphere
[6386.88 - 6392.40] P:1685.48 E:0.099032 |  in Natal we've got blue skies overhead warm temperatures not the oppressive humidity that
[6392.40 - 6398.64] P:1830.19 E:0.094590 |  Italy played England in Manausa against but here they are with 10 men after Marquisio was sent off
[6398.64 - 6403.28] P:1888.17 E:0.097887 |  for a straight red card and they are under huge pressure now the Italians. Pirlo gives it to
[6403.28 - 6407.92] P:1859.36 E:0.097358 |  Casano on the right hand side all the way to the byline little nutmeg into the box very strong
[6407.92 - 6413.28] P:1818.44 E:0.098501 |  defending though and again it's Aravalo who clears the ball away up towards Cavani and Cavani
[6413.28 - 6419.20] P:1818.45 E:0.102579 |  strong in the tackle and he passes it to Suarez who's got to run to the penalty area there's only
[6419.20 - 6425.84] P:1800.74 E:0.099778 |  one defender back Suarez tries to pass and it's intercepted brilliant defending from the Italians
[6425.84 - 6430.80] P:1882.20 E:0.100368 |  Suarez picks it up again little nutmeg on the edge of the box shifts his weight onto his left foot
[6430.80 - 6437.20] P:1820.49 E:0.097468 |  but he can't get the shot clear and once again Louis Suarez at a World Cup is the pantomime
[6437.20 - 6443.44] P:1886.34 E:0.095829 |  villain the Italians are giving him the dirtiest of looks and he's trying to punish them even
[6443.44 - 6448.96] P:1769.88 E:0.096413 |  further one nil Uruguay lead here Italy in possession they have it in the centre with
[6448.96 - 6455.44] P:1769.17 E:0.093490 |  Barolo who came on for Balotelli at half time that was taking off a striker bringing on a midfielder
[6455.44 - 6460.64] P:1800.87 E:0.097928 |  as the Italians were looking to close the game and keeping it nil nil but now there's an urgency
[6460.64 - 6465.44] P:1803.03 E:0.091862 |  because they have to chase it there's a man free of the back post heavy touch though and he wasn't
[6465.44 - 6470.48] P:1803.87 E:0.089889 |  able to come in it was Darmian who had come forward heavy heavy touch and it was taken away
[6470.48 - 6474.88] P:1412.74 E:0.096126 |  from him and cleared away yeah I'm just waiting for the assistant down there to tell us how long
[6474.88 - 6480.56] P:1642.77 E:0.084739 |  there is left now but there must be a whole bunch of time out there has to be left in this game
[6480.56 - 6487.12] P:1694.77 E:0.081597 |  purely because of the fact that there'd be so many stoppages for a multitude of reasons Italy nil
[6487.12 - 6493.12] P:1856.97 E:0.091624 |  Uruguay won still nil nil in the England game against Costa Rica as England's campaign
[6493.68 - 6498.16] P:1782.53 E:0.094908 |  limps its way towards a close as Gaston Ramirez here passes the ball back and
[6498.16 - 6503.68] P:1850.45 E:0.095792 |  Jimenez is in position to wallop away and anywhere will do for Uruguay now they've got Suarez up
[6503.68 - 6510.88] P:1855.31 E:0.087617 |  front at his own Kevani is loitering in midfield everyone else is playing as a defender as Uruguay
[6510.88 - 6516.80] P:1809.80 E:0.086930 |  are clinging on to what they hope will be a first-ever World Cup win against Italy and a place
[6516.80 - 6521.84] P:1838.28 E:0.096314 |  in the second round we've only got 10 seconds of the 90 minutes remaining Cassada rolls it into
[6521.84 - 6526.48] P:1843.26 E:0.086268 |  the penalty area Godine makes an important interception ball comes back in again and it's
[6526.48 - 6531.84] P:1822.12 E:0.090567 |  headed away this time by Casares and it's a good header Uruguay have possession they're just on the
[6531.84 - 6537.60] P:1804.64 E:0.095776 |  edge of their own penalty area Gaston Ramirez is fouled that will relieve a bit of pressure
[6537.60 - 6544.08] P:1819.84 E:0.084812 |  and it's a free kick to Uruguay with five five minutes to be added on for stoppage time well
[6544.08 - 6549.60] P:1624.91 E:0.092017 |  you know Pat Nevin I was in South Africa at the last World Cup when Uruguay beat Ghana and those
[6549.60 - 6554.64] P:1859.97 E:0.087956 |  controversial circumstances and Luis Suarez was at the heart of it and it wasn't that he scored
[6554.64 - 6560.16] P:1819.77 E:0.087006 |  the winning goal but it was this sort of curious altercation in the game when he had that handball
[6560.16 - 6564.48] P:1877.27 E:0.089204 |  and he was shown the straight red card and I remember he hung around in the tunnel and he
[6564.48 - 6569.76] P:1857.77 E:0.091234 |  celebrated when the penalty was missed and it looks like a similar sort of role that Suarez
[6569.76 - 6575.60] P:1893.80 E:0.090061 |  has played here committing what what looks to be a bite on Keolini and Uruguay score straight
[6575.60 - 6579.84] P:1391.33 E:0.092915 |  afterwards yeah and it's not that people are never going to shut up but this one I have to say I was
[6579.84 - 6584.16] P:1442.95 E:0.087122 |  furious at that Ghana one because it was so against the spirit of the game but so many people would do
[6584.16 - 6588.96] P:1456.45 E:0.086609 |  it and at the moment I mean the Italians if if they do last these last five minutes to Uruguay and
[6588.96 - 6594.48] P:1490.36 E:0.092715 |  say to you what the Italians are going to do with this referee they will be absolutely all over them
[6594.48 - 6598.72] P:1675.47 E:0.083794 |  they're furious with them just now they've actually kept a level of control because there's no point
[6598.72 - 6604.08] P:1483.33 E:0.087978 |  in panicking now they need to get on with it they are going out of the World Cup simple as that they
[6604.08 - 6609.20] P:1577.48 E:0.079866 |  must have a go to for the next four minutes or so somehow get a corner get a free kick somewhere
[6609.20 - 6614.48] P:1597.12 E:0.083551 |  20 yards out get it to pillow's feet and you might have a chance to get back in this World Cup
[6614.48 - 6618.72] P:1804.52 E:0.091104 |  well in the immediate aftermath of the Suarez incident there was a close-up on his face
[6618.72 - 6622.80] P:1936.02 E:0.094425 |  and it looked like he was nursing his teeth he was rubbing his teeth in his gums as if he'd
[6622.80 - 6626.40] P:1816.19 E:0.097342 |  actually hurt them now maybe he's saying you know it's like a headbutt scenario and he's been
[6626.40 - 6630.64] P:1841.11 E:0.092392 |  headbutted or shouldered in the mouth and he's feeling the pain there but it's all added to the
[6630.64 - 6635.76] P:1881.69 E:0.093972 |  drama as Italy sent in another low cross this time from Tiscaiglio from the left-hand side
[6635.76 - 6640.72] P:1833.38 E:0.092167 |  but he can't pick out a teammate and it's back now on the half well as Suarez goes down and he
[6640.72 - 6646.96] P:1927.51 E:0.091306 |  gets no sympathy from the Italians referee isn't interested either here come Italy again
[6646.96 - 6652.80] P:1872.81 E:0.092949 |  midway inside the Uruguayan half strong challenge comes in from Aravalo and the Uruguayan's
[6652.80 - 6658.24] P:1981.61 E:0.095502 |  regained possession it's up to Suarez again and a cushioned first touch to Gaston Ramirez
[6658.24 - 6663.36] P:1885.95 E:0.091532 |  and this is where the extra man helps the Uruguayans they've got space down there on the pitch
[6663.36 - 6670.00] P:1849.20 E:0.092184 |  Cavani on the left-hand side we've played two of the five minutes of stoppage time here in Natal on
[6670.00 - 6675.68] P:1849.36 E:0.095465 |  five live Suarez is on the ball again he's just outside the penalty area he doesn't want to attack
[6675.68 - 6681.20] P:1775.65 E:0.092459 |  though this is about killing the game now for Uruguay back to Suarez again on the right-hand side
[6681.20 - 6686.48] P:1697.72 E:0.092611 |  Wallops it off an opponent comes back to him again from Tiscaiglio Aravalo with a run into the
[6686.48 - 6691.76] P:1841.29 E:0.094497 |  penalty area this could finish it all now and he just let the ball slip away from him and Suarez
[6691.76 - 6696.96] P:1872.98 E:0.092482 |  is furious he said why did you attack we're trying to kill the game off you've given the Italians
[6696.96 - 6702.80] P:1863.20 E:0.090688 |  the ball again Casano though gives it away and now possession with Tiscaiglio for Italy but he's
[6702.80 - 6708.88] P:1907.15 E:0.090841 |  inside his own half to Pirlo who so often the Italians look to to create something from nothing
[6708.88 - 6715.76] P:2025.68 E:0.092697 |  he's inside the center circle 10 men behind the ball for Uruguay just 10 men on the field for Italy
[6715.84 - 6722.72] P:1977.78 E:0.091239 |  it's so tense here the Uruguayan fans like tens of thousands of smurfs in their sky blue and white
[6722.72 - 6728.96] P:1933.44 E:0.095615 |  away to our right-hand side cheering and swirling scarves in the air but it's not over yet and they
[6728.96 - 6734.64] P:1978.51 E:0.088891 |  know that there is still two minutes of stoppage time to go Italy are on the attack left-hand
[6734.64 - 6740.64] P:1857.07 E:0.091371 |  side with Pirrolo he can't get it under his control and Aravalo clears the ball Bufon has come out
[6740.64 - 6746.48] P:1906.29 E:0.097898 |  of his penalty area and he's up to the halfway line and he don't even have the ball Pat Nevin
[6746.48 - 6751.60] P:1681.66 E:0.094918 |  he's playing right back I can't believe it well Gaster he's actually had two shots from his own
[6751.60 - 6756.88] P:1840.00 E:0.091341 |  half in this game but Eddie Casieris Bufon is out of his goal Cavani can't get into a position to
[6756.88 - 6764.16] P:1853.57 E:0.092483 |  shoot however and the Italians have possession and it is incredible World Cup drama here in Brazil
[6764.16 - 6770.16] P:1942.21 E:0.091199 |  the Italians could be joining England has been the two nations who go out of this group
[6770.16 - 6774.00] P:1706.83 E:0.096859 |  and as things stand that's what happening still it's all over by the way between Costa
[6774.00 - 6778.48] P:1760.30 E:0.094684 |  Rican England that is finished nil nil he's a chance no I can't believe it then put it into the
[6778.48 - 6784.48] P:1858.87 E:0.092423 |  box and just cross his now chance in there but Pirrolo couldn't get his forehead to it it was
[6784.48 - 6790.00] P:1933.37 E:0.093825 |  Godin the Uruguayan captain who scored the goal and made a brilliant serve now Suarez tries to
[6790.00 - 6796.24] P:1794.48 E:0.090406 |  shoot from close to the halfway line with Bufon well out of his goal and Suarez can't get it on
[6796.24 - 6800.72] P:1641.31 E:0.098094 |  target I can't believe he did it why is he doing that hold the ball I know you can score a goal
[6800.72 - 6805.52] P:1798.73 E:0.090668 |  there you get the ball down play and you're gonna you win you are through you win the game and you're
[6805.52 - 6811.44] P:1851.30 E:0.089137 |  into the next round all the Italians all the Italian substitutes are standing outside of the
[6811.44 - 6816.72] P:1640.33 E:0.094041 |  technical area one or two of them are on the pitch bat I would say it's definitely not all over

[6936.16 - 6941.84] P:1600.96 E:0.092015 |  we will have to hold on either way it's enormous controversy apart from what he did there because
[6941.84 - 6946.16] P:1416.22 E:0.088486 |  he aimed his head towards the opponent it's ascending off anyway so whether he did bite him
[6946.16 - 6950.48] P:1328.50 E:0.087583 |  or not it should have been ascending off anyway but it was off the ball the officials didn't see it
[6950.48 - 6954.96] P:1421.80 E:0.085677 |  I'll tell you I didn't see it because it was so far off the ball every single Italian player

[7110.64 - 7115.36] P:1552.19 E:0.093371 |  seems to show that it is a bite it wasn't a head bite what was your reading of it
[7115.36 - 7120.72] P:1306.12 E:0.104786 |  the reading of it the play was miles away from it was away over the left hand side it was between
[7120.72 - 7126.16] P:1350.62 E:0.098137 |  us and the ball but there was no interest in looking down at him but because he laid down
[7126.16 - 7131.84] P:1365.73 E:0.099409 |  then he rolled about and Kealini was rolling about and then Suarez was rolling about but as soon as
[7131.84 - 7136.88] P:1325.48 E:0.094814 |  you seen a reaction from the Italian players you thought oh dear he's done something wrong I have
[7136.88 - 7142.96] P:1300.84 E:0.096443 |  to say he's gone towards him with his teeth whether he has bitten or not but he has gone and it may
[7142.96 - 7148.00] P:1490.98 E:0.094483 |  have ended up being ahead but I cannot tell you for sure but it's a dreadful reaction now I have to
[7148.00 - 7153.28] P:1377.67 E:0.094569 |  be honest with him be utterly fair with Lewis Suarez he got a hell of a hard afternoon this
[7153.28 - 7158.32] P:1522.14 E:0.094941 |  afternoon he was kicked he was chased he was pulled he was everything all afternoon and he hadn't
[7158.32 - 7163.92] P:1502.40 E:0.092141 |  reacted up until those last few minutes but he reacted again allowed to do that so whether
[7163.92 - 7168.88] P:1397.29 E:0.094510 |  whatever he did be a bite and if it is a bite don't worry I'm with you Danny out you go and for a
[7168.88 - 7174.64] P:1453.62 E:0.091602 |  hell of a long time but even if it wasn't he's put his head on him you can't do that in this game
[7174.64 - 7179.20] P:1435.30 E:0.099031 |  so he will be suspended for the next game anyway but that's happened before didn't seem to affect him
