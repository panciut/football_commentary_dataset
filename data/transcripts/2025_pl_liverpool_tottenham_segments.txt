[0.00 - 2.04] P:1933.08 E:0.018922 |  Football's on, bit the corner, buddy.
[2.04 - 4.20] P:2033.05 E:0.057374 |  We should do that one someday.
[4.20 - 6.20] P:2062.50 E:0.084829 |  It's not bad, is it?
[6.20 - 7.72] P:1978.43 E:0.092482 |  Stunning.
[7.72 - 11.20] P:1987.65 E:0.107084 |  Liverpool are defending the Cop in the first half,
[11.20 - 15.24] P:1798.31 E:0.109180 |  as we're under way on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[15.24 - 18.96] P:1850.79 E:0.103919 |  BBC Sounds and also on the World Service.
[18.96 - 23.24] P:1854.17 E:0.097854 |  Tottenham are in there, Chains Strip, the All-Lilac.
[23.24 - 24.80] P:1883.54 E:0.098172 |  And here are the two teams.
[24.80 - 27.36] P:1826.72 E:0.102118 |  Alisson in goal for Liverpool, Alexander-Arnold,
[27.36 - 28.80] P:1901.56 E:0.096510 |  Van Dijk, Canati and Robertson.
[28.80 - 31.44] P:1984.37 E:0.084931 |  The two changes from the team that played against Leicester
[31.44 - 32.72] P:1995.40 E:0.084069 |  are the two fullbacks.
[32.72 - 35.44] P:1823.28 E:0.097572 |  Alexander-Arnold, who's on the ball now, coming in for Bradley.
[35.44 - 36.88] P:1880.68 E:0.095719 |  Robertson replaces Simicast.
[36.88 - 39.52] P:1886.61 E:0.095841 |  The midfield of McAllister, Gravenberg and Savoslai.
[39.52 - 42.56] P:1841.81 E:0.091378 |  And a front three of Salah Diaz and Cody Gatpo.
[42.56 - 44.68] P:1847.13 E:0.109945 |  Eight changes that Tottenham-Hotspur have made,
[44.68 - 48.04] P:1887.68 E:0.087886 |  as Madison will carry the ball forward on that far side.
[48.04 - 50.04] P:1952.41 E:0.106383 |  It looks for Tel, making the run ahead of him,
[50.04 - 52.32] P:1929.43 E:0.097068 |  and it will go out of play for a goal kick.
[52.32 - 54.52] P:1996.64 E:0.098285 |  Vicario is in goal.
[54.52 - 56.64] P:1965.22 E:0.103751 |  Svens, Davies, Danso and Udogi.
[56.68 - 59.64] P:1887.84 E:0.100888 |  Great, Bergbal, Madison, Johnson, Solanke and Tel.
[59.64 - 64.28] P:1942.15 E:0.093934 |  So only Tel, Svens and Vicario are the three Tottenham players
[64.28 - 66.56] P:1871.41 E:0.107701 |  who retain their place in the starting line-up
[66.56 - 69.24] P:1963.76 E:0.089892 |  after that defeat against Nodigand Forrest.
[69.24 - 71.84] P:1953.38 E:0.099912 |  Liverpool already on the front foot, McAllister,
[71.84 - 75.04] P:2010.16 E:0.113012 |  with a pasty ball out towards this left-hand side.
[76.64 - 79.16] P:2007.49 E:0.105998 |  The noise is deafening inside Anfield.
[79.16 - 82.60] P:2036.23 E:0.094124 |  Don't forget, though, as Steve said, that choice of listening.
[82.60 - 85.96] P:2006.25 E:0.105929 |  The second FA Cup semi-final is on sports extra Nodigand Forrest
[85.96 - 89.56] P:1955.35 E:0.090954 |  against Manchester City, which is under way at Wembley.
[89.56 - 91.96] P:1973.29 E:0.096074 |  We're on air until 7 o'clock tonight,
[91.96 - 95.24] P:2053.77 E:0.107538 |  as Danso gets very, very tight towards Dias
[95.24 - 98.16] P:1982.96 E:0.098209 |  and gives away a direct free-kick 30 yards out from goal.
[98.16 - 100.12] P:2028.30 E:0.084072 |  Really good play there by Dias.
[100.12 - 102.64] P:1791.55 E:0.101384 |  And he's not the tallest, you know, you think of him as most of a winger,
[102.64 - 105.68] P:1941.17 E:0.089246 |  but when he's playing centre, he's very, very strong.
[105.68 - 108.88] P:1890.61 E:0.089282 |  He's got low centre of gravity, really hard to get round him,
[108.88 - 111.72] P:1978.41 E:0.086549 |  and he wins a free-kick just outside shooting range.
[111.72 - 114.84] P:1919.16 E:0.092873 |  But then again, Trent Alexander-Arnold's on the pitch.
[116.16 - 119.60] P:1929.00 E:0.109912 |  Well, it was his goal at Leicester coming off the bench.
[119.60 - 124.60] P:1882.15 E:0.088666 |  He'd missed the previous four since starting against Paris Saint-Germain.
[124.60 - 126.80] P:1947.58 E:0.095775 |  Almost in the middle of March.
[126.80 - 128.16] P:1954.52 E:0.093826 |  He's back in the starting line-up.
[128.16 - 131.76] P:2062.10 E:0.086664 |  It's actually knocked to the England international, who goes towards Salah,
[131.76 - 134.20] P:1962.66 E:0.091893 |  going through someone of a drought, links up with McAllister.
[134.20 - 135.52] P:2031.14 E:0.109090 |  Salah shoots!
[135.52 - 140.16] P:2032.80 E:0.104467 |  Off his left boot, just over the top, over the crossbar goal kick, 0-0, five-line.
[140.16 - 142.84] P:1942.49 E:0.107182 |  And the next stunning way you watch more Salah doing that,
[142.84 - 145.16] P:1865.95 E:0.086507 |  gets a ball on the right-hand side.
[145.20 - 148.56] P:1824.48 E:0.103719 |  There's a 1-2, and you know he's going to go along that 18-yard line.
[148.56 - 151.16] P:1901.15 E:0.083098 |  He does it every time. Can't stop him, though.
[151.16 - 153.24] P:1963.67 E:0.087635 |  Just off target, but good start.
[153.24 - 155.16] P:1906.57 E:0.103887 |  Goal on the WSL, Elizabeth Conway.
[156.16 - 158.00] P:1656.16 E:0.112863 |  It's Leicester-Nil, man-city-1.
[158.00 - 161.24] P:1808.75 E:0.109889 |  The goal at 69 minutes came from a brilliant strike from Jess Park,
[161.24 - 162.36] P:1889.71 E:0.099213 |  at close range.
[162.36 - 165.92] P:1805.31 E:0.111457 |  It's City with all the possession, despite Leicester's heroic defending.
[165.92 - 167.92] P:1947.91 E:0.105488 |  It's Leicester-Nil, man-city-1.
[167.92 - 170.76] P:1953.91 E:0.104894 |  Earlier Chelsea lost their Champions League semi-final,
[170.76 - 172.32] P:1956.58 E:0.107302 |  again by four goals to one,
[172.32 - 175.12] P:1914.61 E:0.103079 |  but once a Barcelona went through 8-2 on aggregate,
[175.12 - 177.88] P:1886.95 E:0.104522 |  Vicario all in yellow in the sunshine.
[177.88 - 181.12] P:1970.99 E:0.105330 |  Patches of blue sky wherever you look above Anfield.
[181.12 - 186.44] P:2003.06 E:0.081065 |  It's the type of weather that reeks of winning the title, doesn't it?
[186.44 - 188.80] P:1935.94 E:0.087904 |  The sun is shining. End of season.
[188.80 - 193.52] P:1973.40 E:0.081291 |  And the fact that they have still got four games left to play...
[195.36 - 199.64] P:2025.35 E:0.084706 |  ..it's felt like it's been a question of when,
[200.64 - 202.44] P:2080.09 E:0.107548 |  rather than if for some time.
[202.44 - 204.64] P:2040.87 E:0.094962 |  But today could well be the day.
[204.64 - 206.84] P:1968.76 E:0.099910 |  Indeed, if it stays like this, it will be the day,
[206.84 - 210.76] P:1957.83 E:0.083761 |  because they just require a point after Arsenal drop points in midweek.
[210.76 - 215.96] P:1864.18 E:0.094097 |  Arna Slott said on Friday that he and the players watched that game all together
[215.96 - 218.56] P:1888.05 E:0.104578 |  as the ball goes back against Tottenham-Hotspur.
[218.56 - 222.56] P:1960.34 E:0.103132 |  And Liverpool, in their illustrious history, have done it twice before
[222.56 - 225.88] P:1930.95 E:0.095268 |  when Tottenham-Hotspur have been the opposition.
[225.88 - 229.04] P:1889.57 E:0.091010 |  1982, the penultimate day of the...
[229.24 - 232.44] P:1969.36 E:0.093289 |  ..or game of the season, they won by three goals to one.
[232.44 - 235.68] P:1943.08 E:0.092101 |  And in 1988, with four games to spare,
[235.68 - 238.52] P:1793.99 E:0.094742 |  they beat Tottenham by a goal to nil here at Anfield.
[238.52 - 242.72] P:1954.02 E:0.090368 |  The great Peter Beersley, part of that superb Liverpool side
[242.72 - 246.52] P:2068.94 E:0.091411 |  with the only goal as Liverpool celebrated title success
[246.52 - 248.52] P:2047.29 E:0.084576 |  in the 80s against Spurs.
[248.52 - 252.72] P:1926.25 E:0.089966 |  As here, Spurs are attacking and Madison to the edge of the area
[252.72 - 255.40] P:1989.93 E:0.091687 |  with his back to goal, back to Archie Gray.
[256.84 - 259.00] P:2085.40 E:0.104213 |  Cross worked over from the left.
[259.12 - 263.04] P:1976.69 E:0.096989 |  Brennan Johnson was almost ready to pounce Liverpool,
[263.04 - 265.00] P:1972.50 E:0.112026 |  get the ball away and then lose the ball,
[265.00 - 266.76] P:1912.83 E:0.093503 |  but in fact, it wouldn't have counted offside.
[266.76 - 269.52] P:1949.93 E:0.100173 |  There's been a goal at Wembley, commentary on Sports Extra.
[269.52 - 271.12] P:1909.47 E:0.093935 |  John Southall, who's got it?
[271.12 - 274.32] P:1726.49 E:0.109597 |  What a start from Manchester City, Nottingham, Forrest Nill,
[274.32 - 278.00] P:1671.27 E:0.111075 |  Manchester City 1, Rico Lewis inside the D.
[278.00 - 280.76] P:1762.14 E:0.109970 |  Really good finish into the bottom left-hand corner.
[280.76 - 283.08] P:1766.45 E:0.097255 |  Forrest Nill, Manchester City 1.
[284.28 - 287.96] P:1911.06 E:0.097380 |  John Murray and Clinton Morrison providing commentary on Sports Extra.
[287.96 - 292.20] P:1916.76 E:0.097093 |  This is exclusive radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live
[292.20 - 294.92] P:1900.64 E:0.102511 |  and the World Service, also available on the BBC Sounds app
[294.92 - 297.24] P:1898.01 E:0.082661 |  from inside Anfield on this sunny day,
[297.24 - 301.36] P:1826.03 E:0.087026 |  where we've been playing for nearly five minutes and it is nil-nil.
[302.64 - 304.28] P:1921.58 E:0.096315 |  What have you made of the start, Pat?
[304.28 - 306.52] P:1793.31 E:0.098648 |  Liverpool have been the better stronger team.
[306.52 - 308.20] P:1590.62 E:0.095096 |  They've been in the ball much more often,
[308.20 - 310.20] P:1710.52 E:0.075921 |  so their position starts to build.
[310.20 - 312.52] P:1572.06 E:0.090066 |  But Tottenham are not being passive.
[312.52 - 314.44] P:1682.67 E:0.110520 |  They're not a team that's not walked out here,
[314.44 - 317.16] P:1699.18 E:0.097217 |  expecting just to be patsies on the day.
[317.24 - 319.16] P:1760.15 E:0.100729 |  They're like the way they've started this game.
[319.16 - 320.52] P:1725.41 E:0.098491 |  It's like an ang post-acord,
[320.52 - 322.76] P:1807.90 E:0.086713 |  they're putting in the effort, they're closing down,
[322.76 - 324.36] P:1743.35 E:0.093741 |  they're trying to get forward in decent numbers
[324.36 - 326.16] P:1907.21 E:0.085566 |  when they actually do get the ball.
[326.16 - 328.84] P:1889.45 E:0.078068 |  So actually, decent stuff so far.
[328.84 - 332.04] P:1912.71 E:0.088373 |  Well, here is Tel, which is 20th birthday today.
[332.04 - 336.76] P:1966.23 E:0.102801 |  He loses the ball, Gravenberg now picks it up and runs forward.
[336.76 - 338.36] P:1862.13 E:0.102285 |  He's got Gatpo going ahead of him.
[338.36 - 340.16] P:1802.33 E:0.103913 |  He looks for a ball through the middle.
[340.16 - 342.28] P:1887.76 E:0.092328 |  It was cut out by a sliding Davis.
[342.28 - 344.00] P:1864.48 E:0.096112 |  DS now, back with Liverpool.
[344.00 - 346.60] P:1867.47 E:0.092926 |  All in red, playing from right to left as we look,
[346.60 - 348.44] P:1779.70 E:0.084138 |  attacking the Anfield road end.
[348.44 - 351.64] P:1909.11 E:0.084959 |  DS, his ball takes the deflection loops in the air
[351.64 - 353.56] P:1676.82 E:0.081205 |  and wasn't necessarily dealt with
[353.56 - 355.88] P:1973.36 E:0.089947 |  at the first time of asking by Odogi
[355.88 - 358.64] P:1923.12 E:0.090111 |  and helped out by Tel, they clear it downfield.
[358.64 - 360.28] P:1660.52 E:0.102269 |  It's just Liverpool, when they are on the ball,
[360.28 - 361.48] P:1689.17 E:0.086427 |  it's much more controlled, isn't it?
[361.48 - 362.80] P:1724.71 E:0.087501 |  They know what they're doing.
[362.80 - 364.84] P:1716.77 E:0.101894 |  They believe in themselves to get it in close.
[364.84 - 367.40] P:1736.88 E:0.097911 |  Approximately, you know, to other blue shots that are getting close,
[367.40 - 369.48] P:1760.18 E:0.084396 |  they're a little bit more stretched.
[369.48 - 370.60] P:1665.40 E:0.104167 |  If you're a Tottenham player,
[370.60 - 372.76] P:1714.63 E:0.094714 |  maybe not so many options ahead of you.
[372.76 - 375.00] P:1663.61 E:0.095330 |  But that's always the case when you come to Anfield.
[375.08 - 378.80] P:1799.56 E:0.085810 |  But this shows you that Liverpool started off the way they wanted to.
[378.80 - 380.44] P:1547.92 E:0.099153 |  The way the manager wanted them to
[380.44 - 382.36] P:1473.64 E:0.078027 |  and the way the fans wanted them to.
[383.24 - 385.88] P:1613.82 E:0.088349 |  Bicarreo, the Tottenham goalkeeper,
[385.88 - 387.24] P:1869.51 E:0.098750 |  has the ball at his feet,
[387.24 - 388.96] P:1749.95 E:0.102802 |  all in yellow away towards our left
[388.96 - 392.24] P:1718.56 E:0.091989 |  as the firework is let off somewhere outside Anfield.
[392.24 - 396.04] P:1865.59 E:0.087950 |  The scene certainly on the team bus made its way to the ground.
[397.00 - 398.96] P:1828.50 E:0.082604 |  Looked like absolute mayhem.
[398.96 - 401.48] P:1864.12 E:0.100662 |  The supporters lining the streets in their thousands.
[401.48 - 404.04] P:1895.85 E:0.091072 |  The red smoke flares were let off.
[404.68 - 407.72] P:1942.82 E:0.090489 |  You hardly see the team bus at one point.
[407.72 - 409.60] P:1915.23 E:0.104293 |  His tail looks for Solanke, cut out.
[409.60 - 413.56] P:1889.51 E:0.107784 |  Then Gravenberg tries to release Salah with an early ball out of defence.
[413.56 - 416.12] P:1898.41 E:0.098540 |  Salah makes a run out towards the left-hand side.
[416.12 - 418.32] P:1722.60 E:0.114338 |  And then his arcing ball into the penalty area.
[418.32 - 420.96] P:1986.52 E:0.097031 |  Goes too far ahead of Dias,
[420.96 - 425.28] P:1830.98 E:0.111606 |  who was making a long-bursting run through the middle to try and keep up with him.
[425.28 - 429.32] P:1938.85 E:0.107165 |  And then Subotlai goes to charge down the clearance from Archie Gray.
[429.32 - 433.80] P:1948.19 E:0.090323 |  Every challenge is being cheered by this fervent Liverpool support.
[433.80 - 435.92] P:1647.85 E:0.097899 |  But the break was brilliant from Liverpool.
[435.92 - 438.08] P:1649.03 E:0.102264 |  Such a typical run there from most of them.
[438.08 - 439.44] P:1654.67 E:0.089700 |  Knows well the spaces.
[439.44 - 442.20] P:1703.78 E:0.101898 |  Looking all the time, he's running away from the goal.
[442.20 - 445.04] P:1781.89 E:0.100199 |  He knew the only ball that could get Dias in
[445.04 - 447.84] P:1753.66 E:0.082941 |  was the one between the centre-back and the goalkeeper.
[447.84 - 450.12] P:1762.84 E:0.082702 |  But otherwise Dias cut himself out from it.
[450.12 - 451.88] P:1614.09 E:0.096273 |  Nothing wrong with the ball from Salah.
[451.88 - 454.48] P:1706.85 E:0.076321 |  Everything right, it's just Dias' stop-runner.
[455.32 - 458.84] P:1831.73 E:0.089857 |  Robertson tied his up. Back it goes to Alisson.
[458.84 - 462.04] P:1805.45 E:0.092079 |  Solanke from the Liverpool player, closes him down.
[462.08 - 464.40] P:1669.58 E:0.105058 |  Out to Khadate, along the ground.
[464.40 - 467.20] P:1886.66 E:0.090770 |  Subotlai lays it off. Gravenberg comes onto it.
[467.20 - 469.20] P:1982.31 E:0.092221 |  Over the halfway line.
[469.20 - 472.12] P:1839.56 E:0.102058 |  And then Gravenberg in field towards McAllister.
[472.12 - 475.64] P:1820.08 E:0.098074 |  Bergwald has scored his first goal for Tottenham against Liverpool
[475.64 - 478.72] P:1850.91 E:0.091143 |  in the League Cup semi-final, first leg in North London.
[478.72 - 482.76] P:1953.32 E:0.082934 |  Makes the challenge. Liverpool though back with Dias.
[482.76 - 484.40] P:1711.08 E:0.107675 |  Gatko on the left-hand side.
[484.40 - 489.68] P:1695.08 E:0.087317 |  Robertson, Van Dijk forward, reaches Gravenberg.
[489.72 - 492.72] P:1838.90 E:0.100799 |  And then the move breaks down as McAllister's pass goes to Strayer
[492.72 - 497.00] P:1791.63 E:0.096316 |  and Ben Davies, the Welsh international, towards Vicario.
[498.00 - 501.04] P:1688.78 E:0.111271 |  But talks a lot about Liverpool, but Postercock, who was saying
[501.04 - 504.72] P:1809.90 E:0.071894 |  that he wants his team to come here and to compete,
[504.72 - 507.48] P:1770.19 E:0.090350 |  wants his team to try and be competitive,
[507.48 - 509.48] P:1781.96 E:0.110167 |  sends his team out with that instruction every time.
[509.48 - 511.96] P:1814.35 E:0.087920 |  I know it hasn't happened for what has been an extremely disappointing
[511.96 - 516.48] P:1902.33 E:0.075136 |  League campaign, and yet it could result in Tottenham
[516.48 - 519.60] P:1764.77 E:0.087348 |  getting their first trophy since 2008,
[519.60 - 521.60] P:1763.80 E:0.111376 |  as the ball from Van Dijk to Gatko.
[521.60 - 527.56] P:1854.23 E:0.111116 |  And Gatko did very well to get it goalwards on the half-bully,
[527.56 - 530.96] P:1940.99 E:0.106661 |  all quick to control, right-footed, and Vicario is touched it behind
[530.96 - 534.40] P:1899.36 E:0.091883 |  for a corner at his near post. Corner kick to Liverpool, 0-0.
[534.40 - 536.28] P:1708.39 E:0.104235 |  No, the assessment referees in the right position.
[536.28 - 539.48] P:1696.45 E:0.099181 |  Now Gatko gets it right on the left-hand side there.
[539.48 - 542.56] P:1824.25 E:0.094036 |  There's not much on there, but he gets it towards the target.
[542.56 - 546.96] P:1858.56 E:0.079655 |  And Tibana's not sure that can physically be a corner kick.
[546.96 - 548.92] P:1795.75 E:0.100435 |  It was either gone out already,
[548.92 - 550.80] P:1785.60 E:0.089943 |  but there's no way that he carried it out.
[550.80 - 552.20] P:1947.36 E:0.080330 |  No chance at all there.
[552.20 - 554.84] P:1960.84 E:0.090814 |  Liverpool have got a bit lucky to get a corner kick here.
[554.84 - 558.60] P:2001.83 E:0.093876 |  Tom Bramble is the referee here this afternoon,
[558.60 - 560.16] P:1922.32 E:0.098951 |  so in front of the Anfield road end,
[560.16 - 562.64] P:1939.00 E:0.091488 |  there's loyal Tottenham fans who've made the journey up.
[562.64 - 566.48] P:1892.45 E:0.072998 |  That's where the corner kick is going to come from on this near side.
[566.48 - 569.00] P:1773.71 E:0.099123 |  He goes into a crowded area, Vicario comes out,
[569.00 - 571.96] P:1920.01 E:0.104355 |  it gets something on it, so Voslai down into the ground.
[572.00 - 577.16] P:1869.68 E:0.105825 |  Oh, the overhead kick from Gatko would have been absolutely exquisite.
[577.16 - 579.20] P:1942.96 E:0.101539 |  He teeded up a couple of times.
[579.20 - 581.32] P:1961.43 E:0.110346 |  His right footed up, it was just off target.
[581.32 - 582.72] P:1972.70 E:0.089626 |  That would have been spectacular.
[582.72 - 586.40] P:1843.21 E:0.092996 |  You know, before he had Tida up, you think there's only one thing you can do here,
[586.40 - 588.20] P:1768.48 E:0.080591 |  but you've got to get everything right.
[588.20 - 591.24] P:1868.50 E:0.084215 |  And he did. The first touch stops it, then he flexes it up,
[591.24 - 594.96] P:1923.95 E:0.095400 |  and then he swivels his body, catches it on the volley.
[594.96 - 598.72] P:1860.21 E:0.100278 |  There is not a hope in the world that Vicario would have said that
[598.72 - 601.84] P:1923.02 E:0.085351 |  had it been on target, but it's just bent away.
[602.72 - 604.68] P:1849.58 E:0.113840 |  He's actually got nine games without a goal.
[604.68 - 609.60] P:1887.48 E:0.079003 |  His last water against Tottenham in the league semi-final for Kodi Gatko.
[609.60 - 612.24] P:2037.27 E:0.100435 |  16 goals he scored for Liverpool.
[613.40 - 616.60] P:1804.83 E:0.079721 |  But it's been a positive start, hasn't it?
[616.60 - 617.72] P:1505.69 E:0.095509 |  Yeah, they've started well.
[617.72 - 620.12] P:1681.93 E:0.088478 |  Gatko's holding the ball up really well there.
[620.12 - 623.52] P:1737.26 E:0.079241 |  Really impressed the way Gravenberg and McAllister,
[623.52 - 624.84] P:1660.48 E:0.109152 |  one of them goes, one of them stays.
[624.84 - 628.56] P:1737.03 E:0.079903 |  Sometimes they seem to understand each other.
[628.56 - 631.48] P:1718.12 E:0.090881 |  It wins the time when it's safe to go and go into dangerous positions,
[631.48 - 634.72] P:1975.19 E:0.087060 |  so really difficult duo to play against,
[634.72 - 639.08] P:1895.29 E:0.079320 |  and that's before you even consider Shoboslai, who's in their try-create space.
[639.08 - 643.04] P:1790.94 E:0.087096 |  They've looked really good so far, however, corner kick against Liverpool.
[643.04 - 647.68] P:1688.98 E:0.093063 |  Yes, Tottenham hot-spoor on this near side, the right, attacking the cop end.
[647.68 - 651.24] P:1684.54 E:0.104648 |  Ten and a half minutes played, Mill-Nil, Madison.
[651.24 - 654.08] P:1974.14 E:0.101931 |  One of those eight changes, strolls across,
[654.08 - 656.52] P:1836.21 E:0.083955 |  and the shadows of the cop to take it.
[656.56 - 660.44] P:1865.66 E:0.091196 |  Salanki winning that corner in a duel with Canate.
[660.44 - 662.84] P:1943.53 E:0.086165 |  He's in no hurry to place the ball down,
[662.84 - 666.52] P:1912.06 E:0.091962 |  and the very fringes of the quadrants on this near side, the right,
[666.52 - 668.88] P:1950.47 E:0.086294 |  Spurs playing from left to right as we look.
[668.88 - 672.80] P:1815.05 E:0.074165 |  Liverpool have every red shirt back inside the penalty area.
[672.80 - 675.20] P:1738.61 E:0.078039 |  It's going to be an out-swinger from Madison.
[675.20 - 678.92] P:1880.53 E:0.088607 |  Left arm goes a lot, right-footed corner kick comes in now,
[678.92 - 683.28] P:1810.82 E:0.101677 |  and the header is in, and Dominic Salanki,
[683.32 - 688.44] P:1799.10 E:0.105162 |  a former Liverpool player on his return here at Anfield,
[688.44 - 690.28] P:1875.96 E:0.108474 |  gives Spurs the lead.
[690.28 - 691.92] P:1839.30 E:0.115606 |  That wasn't in the script.
[691.92 - 695.24] P:1905.23 E:0.110711 |  Liverpool, Mill, Tottenham hot-spoor on.
[695.24 - 696.72] P:1776.76 E:0.110865 |  Well, may not be in the script,
[696.72 - 700.04] P:1785.06 E:0.108201 |  but it was made this very, very interesting indeed.
[700.04 - 702.28] P:1762.02 E:0.095379 |  But hardly been off the pitch so far.
[702.28 - 704.36] P:1602.59 E:0.100474 |  As I say, they've not been playing badly, Spurs,
[704.36 - 706.68] P:1763.47 E:0.096849 |  but Liverpool control most of the possession,
[706.68 - 711.04] P:1640.00 E:0.101153 |  but they get that corner, kiss, and it's a very, very clean hit.
[711.04 - 712.64] P:1568.59 E:0.108206 |  He's on his own really at the back post.
[712.68 - 715.36] P:1609.68 E:0.101012 |  He should never really happen at a corner kick,
[715.36 - 717.20] P:1817.29 E:0.101587 |  but he just uses his physicality,
[717.20 - 721.60] P:1747.06 E:0.087488 |  gets between two players there, and he powers it.
[721.60 - 724.08] P:1826.88 E:0.088066 |  Down low, into the corner.
[724.08 - 727.20] P:1886.62 E:0.089309 |  Absolutely nothing else he can do.
[727.20 - 728.60] P:1893.07 E:0.103579 |  Game on.
[728.60 - 731.68] P:1899.39 E:0.109190 |  Only scored one goal, and he's 27 appearances.
[731.68 - 736.92] P:1869.79 E:0.092945 |  Four Liverpool in that 18-month spell that was ravaged by injury.
[736.92 - 740.16] P:1738.74 E:0.083518 |  But I take you back to 1990,
[740.20 - 743.04] P:1862.96 E:0.104963 |  the last time that Liverpool won the title
[743.04 - 746.08] P:1865.68 E:0.103704 |  in front of their supporters some 35 years ago.
[746.08 - 749.40] P:1708.88 E:0.079630 |  It was against London opposition that day.
[749.40 - 753.60] P:1838.36 E:0.078798 |  And it was slightly earlier, this goal from Solanki,
[753.60 - 755.60] P:1814.15 E:0.106872 |  but Roy Wegerly, after 14 minutes,
[755.60 - 757.72] P:1810.02 E:0.099349 |  gave Queen's Park Rangers the lead
[757.72 - 760.40] P:1901.53 E:0.096143 |  before Ian Rush and that John Barnes penalty
[760.40 - 762.84] P:1908.35 E:0.087931 |  in the second half secured the title.
[764.08 - 765.20] P:1911.61 E:0.096202 |  But Spurs...
[767.28 - 768.28] P:1570.01 E:0.107443 |  A 1-0 up.
[769.28 - 771.44] P:1724.54 E:0.097675 |  And the point that Liverpool require.
[771.44 - 774.60] P:1678.68 E:0.100665 |  Yeah, it's not there, no. Absolutely right.
[774.60 - 776.52] P:1690.53 E:0.095496 |  It's not there just yet.
[776.52 - 778.48] P:1498.51 E:0.092793 |  I mean, we did measure it beforehand.
[778.48 - 780.56] P:1629.82 E:0.098608 |  It's not an absolute foregrip conclusion.
[780.56 - 783.00] P:1663.10 E:0.106322 |  It's late in the hood that Liverpool would win today,
[783.00 - 785.72] P:1677.32 E:0.100935 |  but this makes up much more interesting game, actually,
[785.72 - 787.44] P:1544.69 E:0.105928 |  because the control they expect
[787.44 - 789.44] P:1740.07 E:0.109356 |  to put together, the way they're fans behind them,
[789.44 - 790.76] P:1729.17 E:0.111072 |  they may have a chance now.
[790.76 - 792.24] P:1733.93 E:0.106707 |  And Davis has given the ball away.
[792.24 - 795.72] P:1835.20 E:0.098779 |  Salah with a cross just over the head of a tumbling Lewis Dias.
[795.72 - 797.88] P:1979.92 E:0.094556 |  Spence now, will Claire for Spurs.
[798.16 - 800.92] P:1833.15 E:0.101963 |  And Solanki, who's full of running, I've got to say,
[800.92 - 803.08] P:1935.43 E:0.100124 |  will pursue that ball and Van Dyke
[803.08 - 805.80] P:1969.48 E:0.097768 |  tidies it up back towards Allyson.
[805.80 - 807.88] P:1882.52 E:0.113540 |  Liverpool this season have failed to score
[807.88 - 812.56] P:1754.74 E:0.082124 |  just four times in 51 games in this campaign,
[812.56 - 815.88] P:1808.54 E:0.095658 |  Nottingham, Forrest Spurs, Plenif and Paris Saint-Germain.
[817.36 - 820.72] P:1594.67 E:0.106546 |  What you don't want to do after your Spurs is now to set back
[820.72 - 823.48] P:1663.89 E:0.100866 |  and try and take off as much of the pressure
[823.48 - 824.72] P:1586.86 E:0.115190 |  that's going to get put on you.
[824.72 - 826.88] P:1638.33 E:0.110274 |  You do that here. You do that against Liverpool generally.
[826.88 - 827.72] P:1719.90 E:0.084248 |  It's not going to work.
[827.72 - 829.48] P:1762.00 E:0.103999 |  You do that here at Anfield,
[829.48 - 832.44] P:1677.26 E:0.099856 |  when the fans are in this kind of supporting mood.
[832.44 - 834.52] P:1636.87 E:0.103001 |  It doesn't seem the most sensible thing to do.
[834.52 - 836.88] P:1845.02 E:0.104349 |  So, I said they weren't passive before,
[836.88 - 839.04] P:1856.99 E:0.092400 |  and Spurs have not been passive.
[839.04 - 841.52] P:1825.98 E:0.092388 |  You have to make sure they can keep that up.
[841.52 - 843.84] P:1751.66 E:0.111424 |  Ball out of the top from defense from Conate.
[843.84 - 846.16] P:1821.50 E:0.087402 |  McAllister runs onto it, edge of the area.
[846.16 - 847.36] P:1862.60 E:0.101011 |  He finds Lewis Dias.
[847.36 - 850.12] P:1886.48 E:0.091720 |  Dias turns onto his left foot, back onto his right.
[850.12 - 851.96] P:1857.31 E:0.095984 |  Still can't find a shooting opportunity.
[851.96 - 853.36] P:1856.19 E:0.097710 |  Tries to chip the ball to Salah.
[853.36 - 854.24] P:1881.42 E:0.081034 |  Takes the deflection.
[854.24 - 857.20] P:1791.45 E:0.089317 |  Tell comes back to help out and clears the ball away.
[857.20 - 859.20] P:1934.90 E:0.098087 |  So, in the FA Cup, Manchester City leading,
[859.20 - 860.64] P:1799.21 E:0.103315 |  nottingham forest by a goal to nil.
[860.64 - 862.16] P:1913.06 E:0.080391 |  That's on Sports Extra.
[862.16 - 865.68] P:1836.67 E:0.111874 |  Here at Anfield on five live, the World Service and Vigisly sounds.
[865.68 - 867.96] P:1817.28 E:0.090349 |  Tottenham-Hotspur are 1-0 up.
[867.96 - 872.36] P:1850.23 E:0.093715 |  Tottenham have only had one win in their last 14 league meetings
[872.36 - 873.36] P:1837.68 E:0.101624 |  against Liverpool.
[873.36 - 876.28] P:1833.74 E:0.103155 |  That was actually in North London in September 23.
[876.28 - 878.68] P:1864.59 E:0.101573 |  Jones and Jotter were sent off.
[878.68 - 883.96] P:1906.56 E:0.097576 |  Their record, actually at Anfield, isn't great.
[884.04 - 887.00] P:2014.38 E:0.095678 |  Spurs have lost their last three visits to Anfield
[887.00 - 891.40] P:1899.01 E:0.079536 |  and haven't won in 15 games since 2011.
[891.40 - 894.92] P:1891.25 E:0.089840 |  Vandervaarten-Modrich were on target that particular day.
[894.92 - 897.24] P:1751.28 E:0.096428 |  15 minutes played, update in the rugby league.
[897.24 - 898.68] P:1750.44 E:0.068077 |  Matt Newsom.
[898.68 - 900.36] P:1655.04 E:0.120407 |  Yeah, Wigan have a big buffer now.
[900.36 - 902.48] P:1871.04 E:0.103304 |  32 points to 12, they lead here.
[902.48 - 903.92] P:1808.67 E:0.099869 |  Bevin French with a counterattack.
[903.92 - 905.28] P:1818.88 E:0.096262 |  Hall were on the Wigan line.
[905.28 - 909.60] P:1877.38 E:0.086376 |  Bevin French turned that with a flash and it's 32 points to 12.
[909.60 - 911.52] P:1780.92 E:0.103053 |  15 minutes played here at Anfield.
[911.52 - 912.32] P:1845.11 E:0.053247 |  Pat Nevis.
[912.32 - 915.36] P:1762.52 E:0.085826 |  And if you're a Liverpool fan, you're listening in here.
[915.36 - 917.80] P:1730.44 E:0.095965 |  It's not going to harm whispers, they're not going to set back
[917.80 - 921.24] P:1752.91 E:0.084085 |  and suck up because the manager's called and is post-acoglu.
[921.24 - 923.28] P:1906.60 E:0.106356 |  So they're playing a really high line again,
[923.28 - 925.36] P:1641.50 E:0.085410 |  who sees exactly what Liverpool are,
[925.36 - 928.32] P:1753.97 E:0.062005 |  some of the players like to play against.
[928.32 - 931.64] P:1771.43 E:0.091393 |  Cackpoh's ball in, stabbed away, up into the air by Davis.
[931.64 - 933.28] P:1855.20 E:0.077512 |  Spence heads it away.
[933.28 - 936.24] P:1991.25 E:0.095099 |  McAllister runs away from Solanke.
[936.24 - 938.48] P:1846.38 E:0.095596 |  Back with Van Dijk, left of the centre circle.
[938.48 - 942.12] P:1800.04 E:0.087435 |  Canate, every outfield player is in the half away towards our left.
[942.12 - 944.56] P:1904.46 E:0.084132 |  Here is Canate now coming forward.
[944.56 - 948.44] P:1851.12 E:0.078774 |  They've got two options and he takes the advanced option of Salah,
[948.44 - 950.44] P:1860.11 E:0.118267 |  who now slides the ball through to Sabaswai.
[950.44 - 951.96] P:1974.51 E:0.117771 |  Square is it!
[951.96 - 953.96] P:2003.60 E:0.113626 |  Flaid goes up.
[953.96 - 956.04] P:1894.37 E:0.110883 |  Flaid's raised on the far side.
[956.04 - 958.08] P:1867.85 E:0.106333 |  The celebrations are cut short.
[958.08 - 960.24] P:1873.78 E:0.105130 |  Naturally, BER will have a look.
[960.24 - 961.76] P:1982.82 E:0.112426 |  Liverpool thought they'd equalised.
[961.76 - 963.40] P:1826.36 E:0.102819 |  Yeah, but it is very close.
[963.40 - 965.56] P:1804.63 E:0.084413 |  So through, Ball, I thought was fine.
[965.56 - 967.68] P:1784.09 E:0.102391 |  I don't know if that's the one that's going to get called.
[967.68 - 970.64] P:1807.00 E:0.099834 |  I think it may well be that they actually passed into the middle
[970.64 - 972.28] P:1735.29 E:0.107359 |  of the suggestion that was offside.
[972.28 - 974.32] P:1662.67 E:0.105942 |  So we wasn't here in the monitor.
[974.32 - 976.80] P:1747.04 E:0.090405 |  The first ball I thought was a beautiful through ball.
[976.80 - 979.04] P:1911.68 E:0.071331 |  I thought that was onside.
[979.04 - 981.00] P:1836.76 E:0.110131 |  I'm looking at it again here and it looks onside to me.
[981.00 - 983.08] P:1939.42 E:0.067386 |  It's very, very close.
[983.08 - 985.36] P:1763.99 E:0.091060 |  I wouldn't be surprised if this goal stands.
[985.36 - 987.00] P:2055.84 E:0.097495 |  Sabaswai looked onside.
[987.00 - 993.20] P:1870.55 E:0.085194 |  Certainly Lewis Diaz was coming from a position where he wasn't offside.
[993.20 - 995.68] P:1801.97 E:0.094767 |  I like you, Pat. I think this little goal will stand.
[995.68 - 997.60] P:1807.58 E:0.101958 |  To be honest, it's very, very close
[997.60 - 999.92] P:1831.19 E:0.079254 |  and it's all about that first pass.
[1000.04 - 1002.16] P:1737.16 E:0.089054 |  The assistant referee's put it up.
[1002.16 - 1004.40] P:1803.79 E:0.099653 |  Do you know what? It's right to put it up because you're not sure.
[1004.40 - 1007.04] P:1813.65 E:0.064211 |  Let's have a check. He's never checked it anyway.
[1007.04 - 1010.12] P:1798.82 E:0.090818 |  But my first thought was it was beautifully timed.
[1010.12 - 1012.12] P:1726.63 E:0.073636 |  The pass and the run.
[1012.12 - 1013.80] P:1804.59 E:0.080818 |  This is millimetres.
[1013.80 - 1016.60] P:1609.20 E:0.106023 |  You'll tell by the noise.
[1016.60 - 1021.04] P:1817.91 E:0.117102 |  You will hear the roar when the referee gives his decision.
[1021.04 - 1024.28] P:1807.07 E:0.112301 |  VAR having a look.
[1024.28 - 1025.72] P:1742.98 E:0.117501 |  Semi-automated.
[1025.72 - 1028.44] P:1846.41 E:0.111714 |  I only had one look at it on the monitor.
[1028.48 - 1030.24] P:1906.80 E:0.114269 |  To the naked eye, he looked onside.
[1030.24 - 1035.12] P:1824.64 E:0.090293 |  But I wasn't just, you know, by a shot.
[1035.12 - 1037.68] P:1790.57 E:0.087604 |  The width of a shot. No more than that.
[1037.68 - 1039.68] P:1842.28 E:0.113269 |  But it looked okay.
[1042.08 - 1044.08] P:1920.09 E:0.123239 |  There it is.
[1045.72 - 1052.52] P:1955.99 E:0.118526 |  The goal stands and Lewis Diaz runs away to celebrate an incident.
[1053.72 - 1057.72] P:2004.70 E:0.114082 |  Every Liverpool supporter is on their feet.
[1058.00 - 1060.00] P:2092.75 E:0.100438 |  The shirt scarves, flags.
[1060.00 - 1063.00] P:1992.94 E:0.107518 |  If it's red and white, it's flying in the air.
[1063.00 - 1065.00] P:1878.62 E:0.118787 |  And Lewis Diaz has levelled.
[1065.00 - 1067.00] P:2092.14 E:0.105565 |  And we're back all squared.
[1067.00 - 1070.00] P:2064.28 E:0.106324 |  And Liverpool have the point that they so badly crave.
[1070.00 - 1072.00] P:1933.96 E:0.098456 |  One-one.
[1072.00 - 1074.00] P:1890.59 E:0.108115 |  Unless on the line, it was a brilliant go-in.
[1074.00 - 1077.00] P:1953.36 E:0.111094 |  Classically from that right-hand side, that's what Liverpool do.
[1077.00 - 1079.00] P:1840.54 E:0.113038 |  The tear-teams apart, there's a slightly higher line
[1079.00 - 1081.00] P:1958.54 E:0.114540 |  than you absolutely necessarily have.
[1081.00 - 1083.00] P:1897.00 E:0.109931 |  And there's that slip bow through.
[1083.00 - 1086.00] P:1902.97 E:0.114239 |  And when you get towards a bi-lane, you just know.
[1086.28 - 1089.28] P:1844.90 E:0.107923 |  And it's only the width of a shoulder.
[1089.28 - 1091.28] P:1804.15 E:0.105984 |  It's nothing more than that.
[1091.28 - 1093.28] P:1852.11 E:0.097668 |  But it's a brilliant ball, as usual.
[1093.28 - 1098.28] P:1944.05 E:0.095440 |  The timing the slip bow through by Salah was phenomenal.
[1098.28 - 1101.28] P:1979.07 E:0.091060 |  So, honestly, he's actually done a huge amount so far.
[1101.28 - 1104.28] P:1954.04 E:0.105320 |  But I mentioned before, all he's doing is looking for space.
[1104.28 - 1106.28] P:1991.75 E:0.112155 |  Wow, he found his space there, didn't he?
[1106.28 - 1108.28] P:1995.50 E:0.094652 |  One-one, beautiful goal.
[1108.28 - 1111.28] P:1958.49 E:0.091092 |  Classic, typical Liverpool goal.
[1111.56 - 1115.56] P:2076.48 E:0.113459 |  And the party only went flat for all of four minutes.
[1115.56 - 1118.56] P:2077.74 E:0.100784 |  But you know, it's torn them, you know.
[1118.56 - 1120.56] P:1998.20 E:0.106261 |  The dev goes away, they create chances.
[1120.56 - 1122.56] P:1965.30 E:0.109844 |  You will make chances against them.
[1122.56 - 1124.56] P:1988.66 E:0.106960 |  So, you know, one-one.
[1124.56 - 1127.56] P:1929.67 E:0.103062 |  Let's hope it keeps them being as exciting for the rest of the game.
[1127.56 - 1131.56] P:2047.19 E:0.112058 |  You know, in a main stand, normally that's where the supporters
[1131.56 - 1133.56] P:2045.14 E:0.117174 |  are slightly more reserved.
[1133.56 - 1136.56] P:1929.38 E:0.116766 |  Bergbauer with a cut back on the right-hand side.
[1136.56 - 1139.56] P:1917.19 E:0.096124 |  Not now, as Lewis Diaz's chant reverberates around out.
[1139.84 - 1142.84] P:2041.79 E:0.102149 |  Even in the bottom tier, as a look down,
[1142.84 - 1144.84] P:1961.95 E:0.098363 |  they were dancing in the stands down below.
[1144.84 - 1146.84] P:1989.68 E:0.106227 |  Liverpool won, Tottenham Hotspur won.
[1146.84 - 1148.84] P:2037.95 E:0.095368 |  The tails are up now for Liverpool.
[1148.84 - 1152.84] P:2028.52 E:0.087772 |  Salah holds off the challenge of Udagi and is able to turn.
[1152.84 - 1157.84] P:2050.15 E:0.085194 |  And then waits and then holds onto it and passes the ball back.
[1157.84 - 1159.84] P:2095.73 E:0.105891 |  And here is Van Dijk.
[1159.84 - 1161.84] P:2135.91 E:0.094696 |  Canate right in the centre circle.
[1161.84 - 1163.84] P:2033.09 E:0.117961 |  Fiennes-McAllister.
[1163.84 - 1165.84] P:2038.35 E:0.109500 |  And then the ball goes away.
[1166.12 - 1168.12] P:1879.34 E:0.104978 |  Van Dijk's right-to-the-centre circle.
[1168.12 - 1170.12] P:2052.92 E:0.089142 |  Fiennes-McAllister.
[1170.12 - 1172.12] P:2093.42 E:0.098873 |  So, Bostley helps it out now towards Salah.
[1172.12 - 1177.12] P:1998.92 E:0.094058 |  They are working their way into Tottenham territory.
[1177.12 - 1180.12] P:1906.12 E:0.089719 |  One-one on five lives. Salah on the right.
[1180.12 - 1182.12] P:1932.42 E:0.080448 |  His cross into the penalty area.
[1182.12 - 1184.12] P:2044.02 E:0.081480 |  Headed away by Spence.
[1184.12 - 1186.12] P:1952.65 E:0.087671 |  Solanke.
[1186.12 - 1188.12] P:1998.42 E:0.092435 |  His header is misdirected.
[1188.12 - 1190.12] P:2030.63 E:0.106369 |  Falls to Gravenberg, runs forward.
[1190.12 - 1192.12] P:2012.37 E:0.095800 |  Salah able to turn onto his left boot.
[1192.12 - 1194.12] P:2028.68 E:0.115619 |  Back to Gravenberg!
[1194.40 - 1197.40] P:1916.22 E:0.102119 |  The plug-a-game is raised on the far side.
[1197.40 - 1199.40] P:1995.11 E:0.091424 |  This one might be offside.
[1199.40 - 1202.40] P:2085.24 E:0.088423 |  But again, VAR will have the final say.
[1202.40 - 1204.40] P:1756.10 E:0.106245 |  Stick on offside, that one.
[1204.40 - 1206.40] P:1932.99 E:0.094987 |  Well offside.
[1206.40 - 1208.40] P:1974.56 E:0.090121 |  But it's the same position again.
[1208.40 - 1211.40] P:1931.08 E:0.100795 |  Going down the right-hand side, they are absolutely shredding
[1211.40 - 1213.40] P:1771.86 E:0.092235 |  spells down that right-hand side.
[1213.40 - 1216.40] P:1859.06 E:0.088160 |  I mean, it was not only Wins offside, it was Trace offside
[1216.40 - 1219.40] P:1888.71 E:0.082814 |  that moved, so I don't think there's any doubt about that one at all.
[1219.40 - 1222.40] P:1787.22 E:0.102376 |  But on the right-hand side, they've seen that as a slight weakness there.
[1222.40 - 1224.40] P:1887.75 E:0.090091 |  But it's not getting forward.
[1224.40 - 1227.40] P:1891.04 E:0.087322 |  Every time Salah gets the ball, he looks dangerous.
[1227.40 - 1231.40] P:1824.83 E:0.093768 |  But every player on that right-hand side wants to slip in the ball in
[1231.40 - 1234.40] P:1957.15 E:0.091518 |  because you have third-man runners all the time.
[1234.40 - 1237.40] P:1994.50 E:0.081435 |  By the way, can we go back to the goal for a second?
[1237.40 - 1240.40] P:1936.36 E:0.083140 |  Salah will not get an assist for that goal,
[1240.40 - 1242.40] P:1764.55 E:0.105320 |  which is a crime against football,
[1242.40 - 1245.40] P:1918.19 E:0.093262 |  because it was all the intelligence of Salah and his movement
[1245.40 - 1248.40] P:1967.81 E:0.087520 |  that made that first goal for Liverpool.
[1248.40 - 1251.40] P:2010.13 E:0.103890 |  That goal was disallowed with that underway.
[1251.40 - 1254.40] P:2022.99 E:0.108554 |  And that was the first goal, one Tottenham-Holzberg one,
[1254.40 - 1256.40] P:1964.72 E:0.104679 |  such as the noise inside Anfield.
[1256.40 - 1259.40] P:2093.74 E:0.091330 |  There was an instruction from the studio.
[1259.40 - 1262.40] P:2081.58 E:0.104151 |  Absolutely could not hear it for a minute.
[1264.40 - 1266.40] P:1950.14 E:0.097098 |  But thank you for repeating it.
[1266.40 - 1268.40] P:1713.60 E:0.107669 |  It's an update from Wembley, John Southall.
[1268.40 - 1270.40] P:1692.53 E:0.108864 |  It's Forrest Niel, Man City one.
[1270.40 - 1272.40] P:1857.78 E:0.120734 |  City have been so dominant in these only 20 minutes.
[1272.40 - 1274.40] P:1907.72 E:0.107265 |  Rico Lewis with a goal inside, two minutes.
[1274.40 - 1276.40] P:1895.83 E:0.101211 |  Monmousha has just hit one over the crossbar.
[1276.40 - 1279.40] P:1732.76 E:0.108476 |  Forrest just simply cannot get hold of the ball,
[1279.40 - 1281.40] P:1852.25 E:0.086145 |  and that's what's been happening to him.
[1281.40 - 1283.40] P:1741.11 E:0.111442 |  He's been a real man city one.
[1283.40 - 1285.40] P:1840.88 E:0.106725 |  The red smoke bomb has been let off in the Liverpool end
[1285.40 - 1286.40] P:1875.01 E:0.077917 |  in the Anfield road,
[1286.40 - 1287.40] P:1948.21 E:0.076936 |  and away towards our left.
[1287.40 - 1290.40] P:1983.41 E:0.099036 |  So there's a slight misty red haze,
[1290.40 - 1293.40] P:1938.86 E:0.102380 |  which is drifting towards the blue skies on the Ersy side,
[1293.40 - 1295.40] P:1963.03 E:0.103276 |  as the sun continues to shine.
[1295.40 - 1297.40] P:2002.31 E:0.106951 |  Liverpool one, Tottenham-Holzberg one,
[1297.40 - 1299.40] P:2025.36 E:0.095844 |  we're approaching the midway point in the first half.
[1299.40 - 1300.40] P:1988.53 E:0.102900 |  Pat Ledin.
[1300.40 - 1302.40] P:2000.48 E:0.097747 |  You just watched, but after a sports fan,
[1302.40 - 1304.40] P:1999.00 E:0.101984 |  that was a good turn there, sports fans today.
[1304.40 - 1307.40] P:1961.54 E:0.106520 |  There was a lot of them after a left-hand side.
[1307.40 - 1311.40] P:1973.96 E:0.105168 |  Why are we so high against teams that love to run from deep?
[1311.40 - 1314.40] P:2016.15 E:0.098863 |  And we don't close midfielders down,
[1314.40 - 1316.40] P:1945.65 E:0.087168 |  especially someone like Salah.
[1316.40 - 1318.40] P:1779.40 E:0.105473 |  And he's got so many options.
[1318.40 - 1320.40] P:1786.78 E:0.090492 |  You know Gravenberg will come from deep.
[1320.40 - 1321.40] P:1921.85 E:0.084430 |  You know MacArthur will.
[1321.40 - 1323.40] P:1922.33 E:0.067515 |  Shabazzlite is fantastic at it.
[1323.40 - 1324.40] P:2024.84 E:0.106068 |  Gackposed doing it as well.
[1324.40 - 1327.40] P:1880.21 E:0.096349 |  And by the way, the two fullbacks are going to run from deep as well.
[1327.40 - 1329.40] P:1957.86 E:0.089529 |  Every time they get the ball on midfield,
[1329.40 - 1333.40] P:2005.61 E:0.086887 |  your heart must be in your mouth if you're a sports fan today.
[1334.40 - 1337.40] P:1884.45 E:0.109035 |  That's the familiar voice of Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[1337.40 - 1342.40] P:1915.46 E:0.102607 |  who was with us here this afternoon as Canate with a back pass to Allyson.
[1342.40 - 1345.40] P:1910.51 E:0.076837 |  Able to control it inside the deep, forward ball.
[1345.40 - 1349.40] P:1958.57 E:0.088318 |  Alexander-Arnold comes into a central area and then right footed,
[1349.40 - 1353.40] P:2006.75 E:0.079667 |  hits it and it drifts out of play for a Tottenham throw
[1353.40 - 1356.40] P:1983.71 E:0.087444 |  over on that far side that Old Doggy will take for Spurs.
[1356.40 - 1357.40] P:2035.19 E:0.050152 |  One more.
[1357.40 - 1358.40] P:1911.37 E:0.092884 |  Just calmed down a little bit.
[1358.40 - 1359.40] P:1370.99 E:0.105935 |  I mean, it was me.
[1359.40 - 1361.40] P:1853.41 E:0.084072 |  Never in the five or ten minutes.
[1361.40 - 1365.40] P:1910.17 E:0.088159 |  Liverpool scoring, getting ball in the net again after having lost the goal.
[1365.40 - 1367.40] P:1949.17 E:0.082793 |  So lots of excitement.
[1367.40 - 1370.40] P:1789.13 E:0.090999 |  Maybe it needs a few moments just to calm down a little bit.
[1370.40 - 1373.40] P:1941.89 E:0.088566 |  The players at Liverpool, I just don't think they're late now.
[1373.40 - 1375.40] P:1822.38 E:0.097139 |  I think they want to keep it going at a high tempo.
[1375.40 - 1377.40] P:1986.70 E:0.085470 |  Robertson's header went astray.
[1377.40 - 1381.40] P:1986.13 E:0.093206 |  Spurs have it with Davis, leaves it for Kevin Danso,
[1381.40 - 1386.40] P:1951.78 E:0.092189 |  who is on loan from Longs with an obligation to buy a £21m deal
[1386.40 - 1388.40] P:1799.20 E:0.086441 |  has been lined up in the summer.
[1388.40 - 1392.40] P:1918.00 E:0.086386 |  That'll be a five-year contract as Vicario, the goalkeeper for Spurs,
[1392.40 - 1394.40] P:2056.30 E:0.094407 |  just gives it short and square.
[1394.40 - 1398.40] P:1914.38 E:0.100865 |  Davis, Madison comes over to play the ball forward.
[1398.40 - 1402.40] P:1861.93 E:0.100662 |  He looked for Tel on the left-hand side, cut out by Alexander-Arnold,
[1402.40 - 1406.40] P:1909.63 E:0.096782 |  infield to Diaz, strokes it out now towards Gravenberg, forward to Salah.
[1406.40 - 1410.40] P:1868.79 E:0.098709 |  Right-hand side leveled the area to Gravenberg, gives the ball back towards Salah.
[1410.40 - 1414.40] P:1847.24 E:0.085590 |  Salah tried to return the favour, Gravenberg wasn't on the same wavelength.
[1414.40 - 1417.40] P:1765.04 E:0.096594 |  Madison was there, Tel is back helping out.
[1417.40 - 1420.40] P:1943.43 E:0.114099 |  They're in the first, they were deep, and they've lost the ball.
[1420.40 - 1424.40] P:1958.07 E:0.110058 |  Gravenberg helps it run towards McAllister!
[1424.40 - 1427.40] P:2011.22 E:0.119762 |  Oh, what a goal!
[1429.40 - 1433.40] P:1932.57 E:0.119523 |  Lift-butting rocket into the short right-hand corner.
[1433.40 - 1436.40] P:1992.95 E:0.113840 |  That's the goals again, the party started.
[1436.40 - 1441.40] P:1971.65 E:0.118838 |  Liverpool have come from behind, they lead Spurs by two goals to one.
[1442.40 - 1447.40] P:1982.77 E:0.105738 |  Well, if you're a Liverpool fan, manager, player, but certainly McAllister,
[1447.40 - 1450.40] P:1947.78 E:0.094194 |  you went back, you went to bed last night and thought,
[1450.40 - 1454.40] P:1998.76 E:0.096166 |  wonder if I could score a 20-yarder right in the top corner to put his head.
[1454.40 - 1457.40] P:1972.81 E:0.099710 |  He's just done that there, brilliant.
[1457.40 - 1460.40] P:1891.41 E:0.108066 |  The way the ball was won back, when they had no right to win it back,
[1460.40 - 1463.40] P:1942.09 E:0.097719 |  Spurs tried to play it out to the back, but he didn't have the power
[1463.40 - 1466.40] P:1896.74 E:0.112321 |  and the physicality to hold onto the ball.
[1466.40 - 1470.40] P:1907.11 E:0.101884 |  One back and McAllister all in, one thing in his mind,
[1470.40 - 1474.40] P:1992.80 E:0.101960 |  took two or three little touches across that 18-yard line there after.
[1474.40 - 1478.40] P:1952.60 E:0.089826 |  That's high pressing, it's all a bit high pressing, getting the ball back again.
[1478.40 - 1483.40] P:1900.16 E:0.099693 |  McAllister, it's actually two touches and he lashes it into the top net
[1483.40 - 1485.40] P:1890.22 E:0.107180 |  for him a bit 20 yards, what a goal!
[1485.40 - 1490.40] P:2001.56 E:0.095844 |  Two-one, torture for Spurs fans, but you're not short, are you?
[1490.40 - 1494.40] P:1935.61 E:0.101959 |  He's matched his tally from last season.
[1494.40 - 1499.40] P:1991.56 E:0.095623 |  Seven goals last, seven for this, and he's had some sweet strikes
[1499.40 - 1502.40] P:1864.33 E:0.100523 |  since he arrived from Brighton, Hobalbian.
[1502.40 - 1505.40] P:2054.77 E:0.112835 |  And now the chant is, we're going to win the league.
[1505.40 - 1510.40] P:2091.39 E:0.112291 |  The only needed appoints, Liverpool are on course for all three.
[1510.40 - 1514.40] P:2006.01 E:0.112540 |  This is the atmosphere inside Anfield on BBC Radio.
[1514.40 - 1516.40] P:2093.87 E:0.107678 |  CHEERING
[1522.40 - 1524.40] P:2037.31 E:0.114290 |  From Tottenham Hotspur's point of view,
[1524.40 - 1527.40] P:2083.34 E:0.107468 |  because I know Ant Posthakoglu is looking for a result
[1527.40 - 1530.40] P:2072.47 E:0.104142 |  to try and give them some sort of impetus to take into that game
[1530.40 - 1532.40] P:1992.42 E:0.110670 |  against Boadow-Glimps on Thursday.
[1532.40 - 1536.40] P:2018.44 E:0.090985 |  What they don't want now is to suffer a heavy defeat.
[1536.40 - 1538.40] P:1846.60 E:0.082155 |  Yeah, and the thing about Liverpool,
[1538.40 - 1541.40] P:1954.00 E:0.078987 |  they weren't going through his control today, they wanted this to be a joy.
[1541.40 - 1543.40] P:1890.23 E:0.103562 |  We were talking about it before the game.
[1543.40 - 1545.40] P:1914.28 E:0.082275 |  What do you want if you're Liverpool?
[1545.40 - 1548.40] P:1882.64 E:0.101723 |  You want to win on a sunny day, you want to score lots of goals,
[1548.40 - 1550.40] P:1913.32 E:0.078345 |  you want to win it with style.
[1550.40 - 1553.40] P:1933.18 E:0.096217 |  Now, the two-one, there's been plenty of style about it so far,
[1553.40 - 1555.40] P:1920.35 E:0.081982 |  but they will not stop here.
[1555.40 - 1559.40] P:2003.37 E:0.097018 |  You will keep going. Just one other thing about that goal there from Liverpool.
[1559.40 - 1561.40] P:1897.03 E:0.102235 |  They're winning the ball back by Gravenberg,
[1561.40 - 1564.40] P:1908.31 E:0.089435 |  and then giving it to his mate, Macastor.
[1564.40 - 1567.40] P:1959.21 E:0.091067 |  Those two have been a phenomenal duo in this campaign.
[1567.40 - 1570.40] P:1890.23 E:0.098953 |  Very, very fitting, they should be involved in that.
[1570.40 - 1572.40] P:2038.51 E:0.100415 |  Very important goal.
[1572.40 - 1575.40] P:1994.31 E:0.105975 |  Full-time in the WSL, Elizabeth Conway.
[1575.40 - 1578.40] P:1916.58 E:0.110916 |  It's Leicester Neal, Man City won.
[1578.40 - 1580.40] P:1931.91 E:0.110711 |  A well-deserved win for a dominant Man City.
[1580.40 - 1583.40] P:1899.79 E:0.110327 |  The goal came in the second half with a superb strike from Jess Park.
[1583.40 - 1586.40] P:1864.51 E:0.107480 |  City fans will be thrilled to see Lauren Hent back on the pitch
[1586.40 - 1588.40] P:1712.42 E:0.097742 |  after five months off with injury.
[1588.40 - 1590.40] P:1787.98 E:0.110544 |  It finishes Leicester Neal, Man City won.
[1590.40 - 1594.40] P:2013.00 E:0.093167 |  It's also finished in League One at St Andrews, Birmingham City, four.
[1594.40 - 1597.40] P:2003.62 E:0.099734 |  Mansfield Town, Nill, earlier, Stevenage won, Rotherham won.
[1597.40 - 1600.40] P:1997.47 E:0.085205 |  It was the scoreline in that division.
[1600.40 - 1601.40] P:1799.28 E:0.079688 |  Not even for us, Nill.
[1601.40 - 1603.40] P:1961.68 E:0.092378 |  Manchester City won in the FA Cup semi-final.
[1603.40 - 1605.40] P:1913.24 E:0.093076 |  Remains the latest at Wembley.
[1605.40 - 1608.40] P:2018.90 E:0.084639 |  Commentary of that is currently on Sports Extra.
[1608.40 - 1611.40] P:2011.67 E:0.100568 |  And during the week as well, we've got Tuesday night.
[1611.40 - 1613.40] P:2017.34 E:0.092936 |  Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain, live from the Emirates.
[1613.40 - 1616.40] P:1947.05 E:0.091179 |  And on Thursday, we're live in Bilbao.
[1616.40 - 1618.40] P:1964.83 E:0.092765 |  Athletic Bilbao against Manchester United,
[1618.40 - 1621.40] P:2093.31 E:0.099940 |  but we will have news of Spurs and Chelsea too
[1621.40 - 1624.40] P:2049.11 E:0.085834 |  in their semi-finals of European competition.
[1624.40 - 1627.40] P:2006.63 E:0.085143 |  Tottenham, Hotspur, over on that far side the left.
[1627.40 - 1630.40] P:2044.76 E:0.091630 |  27 minutes played in the sunshine here at Anfield.
[1630.40 - 1633.40] P:2019.49 E:0.084095 |  Have a free kick in front of the Sekenidow-Gliesch stand.
[1633.40 - 1635.40] P:1947.84 E:0.082637 |  And it's Madison, who wraps his foot around it.
[1635.40 - 1637.40] P:2180.57 E:0.100825 |  And Solanki's looping header is tipped over by Alisson.
[1637.40 - 1639.40] P:2112.81 E:0.091030 |  Corner kick to Spurs, two on Liverpool.
[1639.40 - 1641.40] P:2008.80 E:0.081684 |  Yeah, for the fact that Liverpool have been very good.
[1641.40 - 1644.40] P:1753.60 E:0.090244 |  They've managed to go ahead after that one difficult moment
[1644.40 - 1646.40] P:1980.75 E:0.070857 |  with Solanki scored.
[1646.40 - 1648.40] P:1967.93 E:0.094138 |  You wouldn't be absolutely shocked if they scored again, Spurs.
[1648.40 - 1651.40] P:1791.44 E:0.094228 |  Because they do look quite dangerous when they're going forward.
[1651.40 - 1653.40] P:1935.91 E:0.085650 |  Obviously, particularly from set pieces.
[1653.40 - 1656.40] P:1814.28 E:0.086945 |  I mean, Alisson had to do and tipped that one over the bar.
[1656.40 - 1658.40] P:1859.74 E:0.086422 |  It was probably going over anyway, but he knew it.
[1658.40 - 1662.40] P:1951.88 E:0.089757 |  However, we know Spurs scored on from exactly the same possession,
[1662.40 - 1664.40] P:1984.97 E:0.067134 |  which they scored already.
[1664.40 - 1666.40] P:1971.83 E:0.102052 |  And it's on this near side the right,
[1666.40 - 1669.40] P:1913.76 E:0.079992 |  attacking the cop end, playing in the change-outfit.
[1671.40 - 1676.40] P:1965.63 E:0.101751 |  Sky blue or a hint of lilac, hard to tell from our position so far away.
[1676.40 - 1680.40] P:2024.61 E:0.084914 |  Here in our comical position at Anfield, right at the halfway line.
[1680.40 - 1683.40] P:2024.48 E:0.091294 |  But Madison is going to take it, nevertheless, on the right-hand side.
[1683.40 - 1685.40] P:2049.94 E:0.095115 |  And the left arm goes a lot.
[1685.40 - 1687.40] P:2034.47 E:0.093884 |  Tel makes himself available, he's not utilised.
[1687.40 - 1689.40] P:1974.05 E:0.107391 |  And it goes to that area.
[1689.40 - 1692.40] P:2015.23 E:0.091278 |  Canate this time, stood firm, headed it away.
[1692.40 - 1694.40] P:2030.95 E:0.083946 |  Danzo was trying to get on the end of it.
[1694.40 - 1697.40] P:2010.99 E:0.078176 |  Ball is hit by Spence, he goes behind Madison.
[1697.40 - 1699.40] P:1939.61 E:0.114636 |  Will he keep the ball in play?
[1699.40 - 1701.40] P:2019.90 E:0.091117 |  Yes, he will, down by the corner flag.
[1701.40 - 1704.40] P:2065.85 E:0.094010 |  And then Alexander-Arnold wanders across to the left-back area
[1704.40 - 1707.40] P:2012.43 E:0.080833 |  and puts it out of play for a Tottenham throw.
[1707.40 - 1710.40] P:1823.09 E:0.076560 |  Trent looks a wee bit uncomfortable there in that left-back position.
[1710.40 - 1713.40] P:1903.09 E:0.086427 |  Ball went over his head, but he didn't find it, he kept it calm.
[1713.40 - 1716.40] P:2030.33 E:0.082850 |  He made sure Madison couldn't get across there.
[1717.40 - 1719.40] P:1984.03 E:0.112720 |  Did its light blue, just had that confirmed.
[1719.40 - 1724.40] P:1985.34 E:0.087453 |  As Spence sends over the cross from the right, headed forward by Dave.
[1724.40 - 1726.40] P:1942.72 E:0.083607 |  He bounces off the chest of Gravenberg.
[1726.40 - 1729.40] P:2007.10 E:0.089486 |  The boss like, his ball took a deflection.
[1729.40 - 1733.40] P:1966.02 E:0.095285 |  And wow, Alexander-Arnold to volley it away downfield.
[1733.40 - 1736.40] P:1997.50 E:0.089271 |  Spurs tied it back up towards Vicario.
[1736.40 - 1739.40] P:1939.08 E:0.085275 |  Chips the ball out, red though by Gakpo, his header in field.
[1739.40 - 1741.40] P:1931.75 E:0.102430 |  Bergvall can't get there.
[1741.40 - 1745.40] P:1968.54 E:0.099698 |  Diaz was too quick for him, in field to Savoslij, caught by Madison.
[1745.40 - 1749.40] P:2012.73 E:0.094529 |  And Madison gives away a free kick. Savoslij stays down.
[1749.40 - 1751.40] P:1852.63 E:0.091337 |  Let's get an update from Wembley-John Southall.
[1751.40 - 1752.40] P:1767.30 E:0.100599 |  Forrest Nill, man's City 1.
[1752.40 - 1755.40] P:1718.42 E:0.112707 |  Chance for City, Niko Arale did brilliantly 30 yards out,
[1755.40 - 1757.40] P:1836.86 E:0.111655 |  evaded two, three challenges.
[1757.40 - 1759.40] P:1751.15 E:0.096569 |  His 25-yard-wide with the right hand post.
[1759.40 - 1760.40] P:1818.10 E:0.104094 |  Forrest Nill, City 1.
[1760.40 - 1763.40] P:1923.92 E:0.068190 |  Conventary on sports extra.
[1763.40 - 1767.40] P:1929.36 E:0.076914 |  Madison's furious about that free kick being given against him.
[1767.40 - 1771.40] P:2008.71 E:0.086843 |  Again, it's about 32, 33 yards out.
[1771.40 - 1773.40] P:1905.43 E:0.109128 |  And he feels as if he could get the ball.
[1773.40 - 1775.40] P:1843.50 E:0.096267 |  We've seen it in some motion there again.
[1775.40 - 1777.40] P:1922.26 E:0.079579 |  He did get a lot of the ball, but the referee says,
[1777.40 - 1779.40] P:1977.14 E:0.083779 |  we've come in to the back, got a better player.
[1779.40 - 1783.40] P:2045.65 E:0.090502 |  He's given a free kick, and he's within his rates to do that.
[1783.40 - 1785.40] P:2017.03 E:0.111672 |  Well, it is fractionally left of centre.
[1785.40 - 1787.40] P:2012.34 E:0.076696 |  It's 30 yards out.
[1787.40 - 1792.40] P:1941.72 E:0.085115 |  And it's in that area of the field where half of Anfield
[1792.40 - 1794.40] P:1958.14 E:0.105857 |  is in the shadows of the main stand,
[1794.40 - 1797.40] P:1990.36 E:0.070623 |  the other half is bathing in sunshine.
[1797.40 - 1800.40] P:1944.29 E:0.088981 |  And it's just in that little bit of a shadow
[1800.40 - 1803.40] P:2014.36 E:0.084220 |  where you've got Alexander-Arnold,
[1803.40 - 1807.40] P:1929.40 E:0.079520 |  Suboslye and McAllister as a trio deep in discussion.
[1807.40 - 1811.40] P:1903.01 E:0.083883 |  McAllister now walks away and informs part of a two-man wall
[1811.40 - 1813.40] P:2099.52 E:0.100691 |  in front of the three-man Spurswall.
[1813.40 - 1816.40] P:2018.24 E:0.090028 |  It's teed up to Alexander-Arnold who rifles it right-footed
[1816.40 - 1818.40] P:2022.34 E:0.091687 |  over the crossbar goal kick Liverpool lead 2-1.
[1818.40 - 1820.40] P:1830.90 E:0.071529 |  Well, the thing that's going on the line about that as well,
[1820.40 - 1824.40] P:1905.38 E:0.080233 |  is getting it on target straight into the goalkeeper's eyes
[1824.40 - 1826.40] P:1727.99 E:0.069950 |  with the sun right there.
[1826.40 - 1828.40] P:1817.47 E:0.076509 |  You know, just get it on target.
[1828.40 - 1829.40] P:1829.82 E:0.068738 |  That's that question.
[1829.40 - 1832.40] P:1856.18 E:0.087308 |  Keepers hate it when you do that ball on target.
[1832.40 - 1834.40] P:1967.76 E:0.072247 |  Doesn't need to be that fast there.
[1834.40 - 1837.40] P:1923.20 E:0.076983 |  About Ireland, but it was smashed over the top.
[1837.40 - 1840.40] P:1970.63 E:0.087224 |  Solanke might have had a little ludge in the back by Van Dijk,
[1840.40 - 1843.40] P:1959.44 E:0.083876 |  but the referee didn't seem that that was unfair.
[1843.40 - 1845.40] P:2036.71 E:0.090938 |  He lets play continue.
[1845.40 - 1847.40] P:1933.37 E:0.086083 |  Ball played forward by Gravenberg, gets it back.
[1847.40 - 1850.40] P:1998.15 E:0.097844 |  I mentioned our European coverage on 5-LIVE during the week.
[1850.40 - 1854.40] P:2024.21 E:0.105261 |  This today actually is a run of three successive matches
[1854.40 - 1858.40] P:2016.42 E:0.102513 |  for Liverpool against opponents who are in European semi-finals.
[1858.40 - 1860.40] P:2087.96 E:0.095484 |  They travel to Chelsea away next Sunday,
[1860.40 - 1866.40] P:2062.17 E:0.086479 |  and then they're at home to Arsenal on the 11th of May.
[1866.40 - 1870.40] P:2014.26 E:0.099514 |  McAllister, Bergbal closes him down with a help of Van Dijk.
[1870.40 - 1872.40] P:1985.49 E:0.095284 |  They see it back to Allyson.
[1872.40 - 1875.40] P:2037.99 E:0.084087 |  14 minutes to go to halftime. Liverpool 2-1 up.
[1875.40 - 1877.40] P:1932.63 E:0.097321 |  Lovely we're in a really high position here.
[1877.40 - 1881.40] P:1896.39 E:0.087115 |  We're able to see the system, stroke systems, that Liverpool play.
[1881.40 - 1884.40] P:1822.24 E:0.082166 |  They've got centre-forward up there, it's the last DS,
[1884.40 - 1886.40] P:1873.35 E:0.091843 |  but they've got so many others who come from deep.
[1886.40 - 1888.40] P:1931.73 E:0.077563 |  We'll finish that in a minute.
[1888.40 - 1891.40] P:1934.57 E:0.090110 |  Salah, chases after it and just got away from it.
[1891.40 - 1893.40] P:2002.66 E:0.101634 |  Oh, he gets a corner.
[1893.40 - 1894.40] P:2075.30 E:0.102958 |  Slightly surprised by that.
[1894.40 - 1897.40] P:1949.35 E:0.093966 |  I was just saying that if you're a centre-back in New York,
[1897.40 - 1899.40] P:1796.61 E:0.091162 |  who's my man in marking?
[1899.40 - 1902.40] P:1735.21 E:0.086310 |  Well, in one minute you actually think, oh, it's obviously a DS.
[1902.40 - 1906.40] P:1816.01 E:0.079291 |  Then Sabozla will be the centre-forward, and then it's Gravenberg.
[1906.40 - 1909.40] P:1890.26 E:0.098712 |  And it's honestly, you have no idea at any point in time,
[1909.40 - 1912.40] P:2021.59 E:0.096632 |  doing a build-up and play, who that man will be.
[1912.40 - 1916.40] P:1993.06 E:0.090958 |  They rotate it so well with those positions from the midfield forward.
[1916.40 - 1919.40] P:1972.76 E:0.091018 |  It's horrendous, you just have to take your eye off that.
[1919.40 - 1921.40] P:1887.94 E:0.088550 |  Anyone of those players for one minute,
[1921.40 - 1925.40] P:1952.78 E:0.072587 |  and everybody in that midfield could thread a ball through to him.
[1925.40 - 1928.40] P:1983.13 E:0.084444 |  They are a delight to watch, tactically.
[1928.40 - 1931.40] P:1898.65 E:0.109880 |  They've just been blinded by someone in that corner
[1931.40 - 1933.40] P:1923.77 E:0.111189 |  where McAllister waits to take the corner kick,
[1933.40 - 1936.40] P:1872.56 E:0.097303 |  has got two inflatable balloons in the number 20.
[1936.40 - 1940.40] P:1975.88 E:0.089424 |  And because the silver, they're glinting off the sunshine,
[1940.40 - 1943.40] P:1884.75 E:0.086193 |  as McAllister got a standing ovation,
[1943.40 - 1946.40] P:1860.02 E:0.096839 |  Redmond is to take that corner kick over on that far side.
[1946.40 - 1949.40] P:1937.51 E:0.075630 |  Liverpool lead by two goals to one.
[1949.40 - 1952.40] P:1849.52 E:0.090375 |  There's still those balloons are being lifted in the air.
[1952.40 - 1956.40] P:1871.47 E:0.061583 |  They've had beach balls being banded around ahead of kickoff.
[1956.40 - 1958.40] P:1868.22 E:0.070658 |  Red and white balloons.
[1958.40 - 1962.40] P:1893.91 E:0.090120 |  Certainly that fellow who had the replica Premier League trophy,
[1962.40 - 1966.40] P:1982.38 E:0.077439 |  if Steve Crossman said he was charging ten pounds of photo,
[1966.40 - 1968.40] P:1965.43 E:0.093429 |  when I walked past him, he was charging a fiver.
[1968.40 - 1971.40] P:1948.22 E:0.080780 |  He must have made a real mint today.
[1971.40 - 1973.40] P:1987.22 E:0.069033 |  You've seen him coming.
[1974.40 - 1976.40] P:1967.85 E:0.104847 |  McAllister still waits to take it.
[1976.40 - 1977.40] P:1864.93 E:0.087179 |  The referee...
[1977.40 - 1979.40] P:1708.53 E:0.087623 |  It's weird, the ball keeps rolling off.
[1979.40 - 1981.40] P:1903.06 E:0.067399 |  You know, I didn't think it was that.
[1981.40 - 1984.40] P:1759.28 E:0.085330 |  We were quite high up, so it doesn't look that windy down there,
[1984.40 - 1986.40] P:1851.87 E:0.080347 |  and it shouldn't be with that huge stadium,
[1986.40 - 1988.40] P:1818.35 E:0.069303 |  but the ball keeps rolling off the spot.
[1988.40 - 1991.40] P:1843.54 E:0.060496 |  He waits, and then with a third time of asking,
[1991.40 - 1994.40] P:1691.82 E:0.090469 |  and in it comes now from that right-hand side, Bergmaus header.
[1994.40 - 1996.40] P:1934.29 E:0.089749 |  Might fall here to Gakpo.
[1996.40 - 1998.40] P:1998.12 E:0.108332 |  Gakpo gets the shot away!
[1998.40 - 2000.40] P:2039.89 E:0.113344 |  Gakpo touches it in.
[2000.40 - 2002.40] P:1892.19 E:0.121774 |  There's no shot in Liverpool now.
[2004.40 - 2005.40] P:1994.56 E:0.113330 |  Cody Gakpo.
[2005.40 - 2007.40] P:2064.66 E:0.107106 |  His last goal was against Spurs.
[2007.40 - 2011.40] P:2010.84 E:0.105029 |  It's his first in ten, and it's against Carmel Hotspur.
[2012.40 - 2015.40] P:2030.63 E:0.114418 |  Liverpool now lead by three goals to one.
[2017.40 - 2020.40] P:2041.39 E:0.106496 |  And they are on course for the Premier League title.
[2022.40 - 2025.40] P:1997.42 E:0.105653 |  You know, Twinkle toes. It gets the ball down there.
[2025.40 - 2027.40] P:2012.38 E:0.096423 |  It really ought not to get shot away there.
[2027.40 - 2029.40] P:1803.11 E:0.106258 |  If you're defending well there,
[2029.40 - 2031.40] P:1960.42 E:0.101527 |  you should actually be able to close them down,
[2031.40 - 2033.40] P:1877.00 E:0.102800 |  but he's got such quick feet there.
[2033.40 - 2036.40] P:1859.61 E:0.113134 |  He knows what he wants to do all the way through that move,
[2036.40 - 2038.40] P:1937.31 E:0.095124 |  so when it gets to him, he just goes to his right,
[2038.40 - 2041.40] P:1863.37 E:0.102888 |  away from the goal, knowing that he wants to switch it back
[2041.40 - 2045.40] P:1899.13 E:0.090189 |  to that far corner, and he does it brilliantly.
[2045.40 - 2048.40] P:1836.35 E:0.099771 |  But if you're an Angposted Cogway, if you're a Spurs fan,
[2048.40 - 2050.40] P:1887.75 E:0.102929 |  or a Spurs defender, you're thinking,
[2050.40 - 2052.40] P:1869.32 E:0.092738 |  someone's got to make a tackle there.
[2052.40 - 2055.40] P:1921.67 E:0.102488 |  And he just dances through two challenges
[2055.40 - 2057.40] P:1940.58 E:0.094246 |  and just pings it into the corner.
[2057.40 - 2061.40] P:1916.85 E:0.093072 |  Three you won, and I think Liverpool fans can relax a wee bit now.
[2062.40 - 2065.40] P:1906.84 E:0.106175 |  I know who you were referring to earlier when you spoke
[2065.40 - 2069.40] P:2014.59 E:0.088447 |  about the gentleman who was a little bit apprehensive,
[2069.40 - 2070.40] P:1977.13 E:0.099083 |  shouldn't we say?
[2070.40 - 2071.40] P:1910.16 E:0.093545 |  Yes.
[2071.40 - 2073.40] P:1876.46 E:0.093211 |  I know him well. I would imagine...
[2075.40 - 2077.40] P:2004.79 E:0.113178 |  ...that he can relax.
[2077.40 - 2078.40] P:1932.06 E:0.094883 |  He can relax.
[2078.40 - 2080.40] P:1957.95 E:0.106095 |  Yeah. Honestly, he was worried about it,
[2080.40 - 2082.40] P:1974.43 E:0.111110 |  and actually it's a man we experienced,
[2082.40 - 2084.40] P:2027.17 E:0.098056 |  but it seemed nothing for granted.
[2084.40 - 2087.40] P:1936.69 E:0.108988 |  In a second, maybe, it seemed nothing for granted in football.
[2087.40 - 2090.40] P:1924.84 E:0.101553 |  But these fans here have now,
[2090.40 - 2093.40] P:2073.85 E:0.105924 |  basically, a professional starter department.
[2094.40 - 2098.40] P:2070.99 E:0.106465 |  And Kody Gatpo took the shirt off with his goal celebrations
[2098.40 - 2100.40] P:1931.35 E:0.095906 |  and was booked as a result.
[2100.40 - 2103.40] P:1949.75 E:0.096058 |  So Kody Gatpo shown a yellow card.
[2103.40 - 2106.40] P:1995.42 E:0.077706 |  I don't think that he will mind too much about that.
[2106.40 - 2109.40] P:2026.00 E:0.092949 |  Bergbauer the cross, stopped by Virgil van Dijk.
[2109.40 - 2111.40] P:2014.06 E:0.069016 |  Tottenham took the lead.
[2111.40 - 2113.40] P:1975.26 E:0.106301 |  Liverpool, though, have responded with three goals,
[2113.40 - 2115.40] P:1978.18 E:0.092913 |  and we still have ten minutes to go to halftime,
[2115.40 - 2117.40] P:2041.38 E:0.088802 |  and they're full of running.
[2117.40 - 2119.40] P:2048.68 E:0.097101 |  Salah, he'll want to get on the score sheet.
[2119.40 - 2122.40] P:2021.72 E:0.090760 |  They lose the ball, Tell looks towards Madison,
[2122.40 - 2124.40] P:2009.25 E:0.083908 |  and he's stopped by Canate.
[2124.40 - 2127.40] P:1966.33 E:0.093187 |  And then Canate, linking up with Lewis Diaz.
[2127.40 - 2132.40] P:1978.41 E:0.084081 |  He looks over his shoulder, shrugs off the challenge of Tell,
[2132.40 - 2135.40] P:1880.29 E:0.087977 |  and finds Alexander-Arnold ahead of him on that right-hand side.
[2135.40 - 2137.40] P:1998.45 E:0.103807 |  And then Canate, filling in as a right back,
[2137.40 - 2139.40] P:2072.91 E:0.082216 |  gets it back from Salah.
[2139.40 - 2140.40] P:2095.70 E:0.075722 |  They're in full control.
[2140.40 - 2143.40] P:1909.26 E:0.088112 |  They are, and, you know, I was talking at the start of the game
[2143.40 - 2146.40] P:1862.41 E:0.093531 |  about the improvements you're getting for the likes of Gatpo,
[2146.40 - 2148.40] P:1983.17 E:0.090176 |  becoming better and better,
[2148.40 - 2150.40] P:1965.93 E:0.089630 |  suppose like growing into all the rest of them.
[2150.40 - 2155.40] P:1986.08 E:0.082218 |  Has there any player improved more in terms of quality than Canate?
[2155.40 - 2158.40] P:1957.17 E:0.083064 |  He has become, and, hey, I stole a lot,
[2158.40 - 2160.40] P:1863.27 E:0.075991 |  but much, much more comfortable in the ball.
[2160.40 - 2162.40] P:1977.92 E:0.089771 |  Reading the game generally much better.
[2162.40 - 2164.40] P:1859.93 E:0.091127 |  Hey, every defender will make mistakes,
[2164.40 - 2166.40] P:1857.10 E:0.088262 |  but every time he's on the ball now,
[2166.40 - 2169.40] P:1977.44 E:0.093107 |  he gets such a reaction from this crowd here.
[2169.40 - 2171.40] P:2053.40 E:0.094634 |  Much loved.
[2171.40 - 2173.40] P:2021.55 E:0.119094 |  Full-time in the Super League, Matt Newsom.
[2173.40 - 2175.40] P:1853.66 E:0.117575 |  Yeah, Wigan looking ominous.
[2175.40 - 2177.40] P:1879.09 E:0.109171 |  36-12, they've beaten Ho here.
[2177.40 - 2178.40] P:1761.06 E:0.100851 |  They climb up to second.
[2178.40 - 2180.40] P:1943.23 E:0.107815 |  Bevin French was the star.
[2180.40 - 2183.40] P:1882.77 E:0.110973 |  He had his hand up pretty much in fingertips, pretty much on everything.
[2183.40 - 2186.40] P:1832.38 E:0.111705 |  Foul FC lived with Wigan in the first half, scoring their 12 points.
[2186.40 - 2190.40] P:1794.74 E:0.109092 |  Will Price looking good, but in the end, it's Wigan looking back to their best.
[2190.40 - 2192.40] P:1763.81 E:0.110340 |  Foul FC-12, Wigan 36.
[2192.40 - 2194.40] P:1833.63 E:0.105575 |  When Pat says that the party has started,
[2194.40 - 2197.40] P:1725.21 E:0.101335 |  it seems that every Liverpool supporter inside Anfield
[2197.40 - 2202.40] P:1823.03 E:0.079815 |  is swirling their red and white scarf over their heads as they celebrate.
[2202.40 - 2204.40] P:1913.09 E:0.105189 |  They're leading by three goals to one.
[2204.40 - 2207.40] P:1931.22 E:0.093152 |  They're under way in the Women's Champions League semi-final,
[2207.40 - 2209.40] P:1861.69 E:0.080632 |  and they're leading by Leon against Arsenal.
[2209.40 - 2210.40] P:1798.71 E:0.093166 |  Victoria Polly.
[2210.40 - 2214.40] P:1813.26 E:0.094287 |  And Arsenal have a 2-1 deficit to overturn from the first leg.
[2214.40 - 2218.40] P:1856.26 E:0.104528 |  They've come back in both of their previous knockout ties this season so far,
[2218.40 - 2222.40] P:1821.75 E:0.096840 |  but Leon are record eight-times champions of this competition.
[2222.40 - 2225.40] P:1864.09 E:0.102741 |  Daphne Van Gomsela returns from injury in goal for Arsenal,
[2225.40 - 2229.40] P:1852.48 E:0.084616 |  while Chloe Kelly is favoured for Beth Mead.
[2229.40 - 2232.40] P:1811.93 E:0.098884 |  And much talked about Leon's star defender, Wendy Reinhardt.
[2232.40 - 2234.40] P:1871.68 E:0.089716 |  He's back in the side, and Arsenal have just taken the lead.
[2234.40 - 2236.40] P:1927.36 E:0.075105 |  They've got it back to T2.
[2236.40 - 2238.40] P:1952.73 E:0.085964 |  They've got that goal. That'll make it interesting.
[2238.40 - 2241.40] P:1959.86 E:0.096916 |  Barcelona earlier beat Chelsea's women by four goals to one,
[2241.40 - 2244.40] P:1921.07 E:0.081791 |  so they went through eight-two on aggregate.
[2244.40 - 2246.40] P:1921.27 E:0.097801 |  So we'll keep you in touch with that.
[2246.40 - 2247.40] P:1918.24 E:0.106412 |  This is five-lie.
[2247.40 - 2250.40] P:1974.70 E:0.081756 |  We're also live on the World Service and BBC Sounds.
[2250.40 - 2254.40] P:1999.00 E:0.086796 |  And Liverpool leading three-one.
[2254.40 - 2257.40] P:2043.50 E:0.100061 |  This fixture has produced more goals than any other
[2257.40 - 2259.40] P:1951.21 E:0.105563 |  in Liverpool's Premier League history,
[2259.40 - 2263.40] P:2011.14 E:0.090429 |  and we've currently had 204 now that have been scored
[2263.40 - 2265.40] P:1947.47 E:0.071302 |  between Tottenham and Liverpool.
[2265.40 - 2267.40] P:1896.33 E:0.082747 |  And they met just before Christmas.
[2267.40 - 2270.40] P:1889.57 E:0.094041 |  It was 6-3 in North London.
[2270.40 - 2273.40] P:1805.86 E:0.096458 |  We could have a few more yet to add to the tally that we've got already.
[2273.40 - 2277.40] P:1698.01 E:0.107182 |  You could, I mean, obviously, Liverpool are looking great favourites
[2277.40 - 2279.40] P:1859.63 E:0.111953 |  at the moment, but it's three-one,
[2279.40 - 2282.40] P:1871.83 E:0.103888 |  if Spurs could get a goal back, although they've not had that many
[2282.40 - 2284.40] P:1946.10 E:0.092457 |  opportunities to go up the field.
[2284.40 - 2286.40] P:1749.43 E:0.110314 |  If he could get one before half-time, but it doesn't look like...
[2286.40 - 2288.40] P:1951.47 E:0.088742 |  Oh!
[2288.40 - 2290.40] P:1979.99 E:0.112840 |  Almost broke away against Liverpool.
[2290.40 - 2293.40] P:1898.75 E:0.089607 |  Required Ben Davies to come across and to curb the run of Dias,
[2293.40 - 2295.40] P:1696.78 E:0.111157 |  but the referee has brought play back.
[2295.40 - 2298.40] P:1700.43 E:0.105921 |  Referee Thomas Bravel, Liverpool have got a free kick.
[2298.40 - 2302.40] P:1920.21 E:0.119685 |  It's a deafening noise inside Anfield.
[2308.40 - 2311.40] P:1955.59 E:0.117172 |  Robertson on the halfway line back towards Van Dijk.
[2312.40 - 2315.40] P:2103.18 E:0.098211 |  They're looking to make up for the title
[2315.40 - 2318.40] P:1986.81 E:0.100369 |  that they couldn't celebrate five years ago.
[2319.40 - 2321.40] P:1987.62 E:0.104774 |  Not with the team, at least anyway.
[2321.40 - 2326.40] P:2054.63 E:0.075596 |  Difficult times during that Covid period
[2326.40 - 2330.40] P:2022.24 E:0.099651 |  and the social distancing as Liverpool get it up now towards Gatpo.
[2330.40 - 2333.40] P:1931.96 E:0.093567 |  Robertson's bobbing on with him on the left-hand side as Gatpo now
[2333.40 - 2336.40] P:2005.46 E:0.093005 |  makes a running feel, uses Robertson's run.
[2336.40 - 2339.40] P:2056.11 E:0.086810 |  Robertson's cross, Salah's header, here is the boss line.
[2339.40 - 2343.40] P:1962.31 E:0.096078 |  Teesam Alexander-Arnold down into the ground, Davies with a header away.
[2343.40 - 2347.40] P:2024.95 E:0.117190 |  Liverpool are riding on the crest of a wave
[2347.40 - 2349.40] P:1966.07 E:0.114617 |  and the energy inside Anfield Stadium.
[2349.40 - 2351.40] P:1920.45 E:0.100462 |  Yeah, that move was sumptuous.
[2351.40 - 2354.40] P:1907.96 E:0.104069 |  It was an absolute joy to watch.
[2354.40 - 2357.40] P:1967.19 E:0.097827 |  I mean, you knew it, every single pass it was going to be made,
[2357.40 - 2359.40] P:2004.23 E:0.092355 |  two or three seconds before it was made,
[2359.40 - 2361.40] P:1782.05 E:0.097412 |  but it didn't matter, I suppose couldn't do it in about it.
[2361.40 - 2364.40] P:1876.06 E:0.076505 |  That move deserved a goal from the left-hand side down.
[2364.40 - 2366.40] P:1865.88 E:0.086966 |  Ended up a short and target, no goal,
[2366.40 - 2369.40] P:1762.41 E:0.084730 |  but they are playing some lovely football just now, Liverpool.
[2369.40 - 2373.40] P:1876.20 E:0.092057 |  So we've got about five minutes to go to halftime here on five live.
[2373.40 - 2376.40] P:1855.38 E:0.090158 |  Not even Forrest Manchester City was also a 430 kickoff.
[2376.40 - 2377.40] P:1966.74 E:0.079156 |  John Southall.
[2377.40 - 2380.40] P:1683.46 E:0.103685 |  Played 38 minutes here, not even Forrest Neal, Manchester City won,
[2380.40 - 2384.40] P:1638.35 E:0.108037 |  City in total control at the moment, one chance for Forrest.
[2384.40 - 2386.40] P:1817.47 E:0.105881 |  The flag was up though, Chris Wood, good chance,
[2386.40 - 2390.40] P:1918.31 E:0.104506 |  one of the right-hand post, Forrest Neal, Man City won.
[2390.40 - 2393.40] P:2007.15 E:0.093843 |  Well, Arna Slopp, when he spoke to the media ahead of this game,
[2393.40 - 2395.40] P:1883.44 E:0.093949 |  he was asked, will you enjoy it?
[2395.40 - 2401.40] P:1992.93 E:0.088856 |  And he said, I'll only enjoy it once the final whistle has sounded.
[2401.40 - 2405.40] P:1861.97 E:0.086496 |  You might remember European clock with that chance of Arna Slopp,
[2405.40 - 2410.40] P:1945.95 E:0.087991 |  that is the chance that is currently being sung by the Liverpool supporters
[2410.40 - 2412.40] P:1964.28 E:0.066467 |  inside Anfield.
[2412.40 - 2415.40] P:1887.42 E:0.095990 |  He will be the third Liverpool manager to win the league title
[2415.40 - 2418.40] P:1963.35 E:0.078974 |  in his first full season, as Tel to the edge of the area
[2418.40 - 2420.40] P:1868.65 E:0.095994 |  is held up by Alexander Arnall.
[2420.40 - 2423.40] P:1985.27 E:0.090942 |  Madison, still with Spurs on that far side,
[2423.40 - 2428.40] P:1970.48 E:0.079829 |  Spurs with a cross coming in, tucked in with Robertson to head it away.
[2428.40 - 2433.40] P:2003.41 E:0.094013 |  Joe Fagan, 84, Sir Kenneth Alglish, 86.
[2433.40 - 2436.40] P:2008.24 E:0.090340 |  Arna Slopp is an extremely good company.
[2436.40 - 2439.40] P:1949.06 E:0.084002 |  It is a phenomenal thing to do in your first season.
[2439.40 - 2442.40] P:1950.23 E:0.074748 |  I'd love to underline just now.
[2442.40 - 2444.40] P:1845.69 E:0.085141 |  I did not see this coming at the start of the season.
[2444.40 - 2447.40] P:1917.27 E:0.083280 |  I tell a lot of people who say now, oh yeah,
[2447.40 - 2449.40] P:1844.91 E:0.091730 |  they were definitely going to go and push you on.
[2449.40 - 2451.40] P:1968.01 E:0.077829 |  Come on, losing your green clock.
[2451.40 - 2454.40] P:1945.97 E:0.083313 |  He just didn't feel it could go that this well.
[2454.40 - 2460.40] P:1877.34 E:0.083945 |  So that adds to the fact that the expectation was a wee bit more limited
[2460.40 - 2461.40] P:1966.13 E:0.085923 |  than others had had.
[2461.40 - 2464.40] P:1922.92 E:0.079855 |  Slopp would have been given a lot of that more time, wouldn't he?
[2464.40 - 2466.40] P:1922.96 E:0.102263 |  But he absolutely hasn't needed it.
[2466.40 - 2467.40] P:1930.00 E:0.081822 |  He's been brilliant so far.
[2467.40 - 2469.40] P:1995.91 E:0.087544 |  But I don't think you're alone.
[2469.40 - 2474.40] P:1926.75 E:0.085364 |  I don't think many neutrals would have expected Liverpool to be in this position,
[2474.40 - 2477.40] P:1947.30 E:0.081567 |  not with still four games remaining as well.
[2477.40 - 2479.40] P:1937.80 E:0.090304 |  And in fact, I don't know whether you're one of them,
[2479.40 - 2483.40] P:1923.75 E:0.091355 |  but I don't think there was one BBC pundit on the BBC Sport website
[2483.40 - 2485.40] P:1961.80 E:0.084996 |  that predicted that Liverpool would win the title this year.
[2485.40 - 2490.40] P:1883.57 E:0.087625 |  I realise, I rated Jurgen Klopp and his effect on Liverpool Football Club so highly.
[2490.40 - 2492.40] P:1872.87 E:0.071007 |  I just said, we're lucky to get the top four.
[2492.40 - 2494.40] P:1729.57 E:0.083684 |  It's not an anti-Liverpool.
[2494.40 - 2497.40] P:1852.20 E:0.075786 |  It's just a respect for what Jurgen Klopp had brought to this club.
[2497.40 - 2501.40] P:1816.54 E:0.080282 |  However, I didn't know how good on the slot would be.
[2501.40 - 2503.40] P:1631.90 E:0.092563 |  And also the fact that it's more than that,
[2503.40 - 2504.40] P:1899.52 E:0.063319 |  there's something else, something bigger,
[2504.40 - 2506.40] P:1838.46 E:0.087336 |  which we'll deal with after the game,
[2506.40 - 2509.40] P:1836.79 E:0.088512 |  which is bringing in the right players over a period of time
[2509.40 - 2510.40] P:1913.96 E:0.089609 |  and them growing into it.
[2510.40 - 2512.40] P:1922.01 E:0.078857 |  And that's when you talk about the Shippo's lies
[2512.40 - 2515.40] P:1790.94 E:0.089370 |  and the McAllisters and Gackpoes, etc.
[2515.40 - 2519.40] P:1820.16 E:0.083381 |  They're just getting better and better and better all the time.
[2519.40 - 2523.40] P:1856.04 E:0.102895 |  Well, if you recall the conversation that he had with Gary Lineker
[2523.40 - 2527.40] P:1965.20 E:0.086580 |  earlier in the season, you can go back and find it on the BBC Sounds app.
[2527.40 - 2532.40] P:1900.51 E:0.088750 |  He was talking a lot about the work that he inherited from Jurgen Klopp
[2532.40 - 2535.40] P:2023.67 E:0.097071 |  and the culture within the training ground that he'd also inherited.
[2535.40 - 2538.40] P:2052.25 E:0.092368 |  As Johnson comes forward for Spurs, in towards Solanke,
[2538.40 - 2541.40] P:1886.04 E:0.103523 |  Tel-Ariving, Canate had to make the challenge.
[2541.40 - 2544.40] P:1979.58 E:0.096381 |  Now, did Canate get a nibble of Tel, who's gone down?
[2544.40 - 2545.40] P:2093.85 E:0.114935 |  VAR will have a look at it.
[2545.40 - 2546.40] P:1834.12 E:0.082801 |  Must have a look at that.
[2546.40 - 2548.40] P:1732.96 E:0.097149 |  I mean, if it doesn't get any of the ball, that's apparently kicking out.
[2548.40 - 2549.40] P:1878.09 E:0.062833 |  That's apparently kicking out.
[2549.40 - 2552.40] P:1948.17 E:0.089025 |  Absolutely should be apparently kicking out if it doesn't get any of the ball.
[2552.40 - 2553.40] P:2004.66 E:0.088179 |  Referee's slowing it down.
[2553.40 - 2555.40] P:1809.15 E:0.097901 |  He sees an injury on the pitch here.
[2555.40 - 2559.40] P:1828.75 E:0.086486 |  So he's giving the serve a little bit of breathing space here, the referee, hasn't he?
[2559.40 - 2562.40] P:1857.77 E:0.066011 |  Stopped the game, injury in the far side there.
[2562.40 - 2564.40] P:1838.06 E:0.084115 |  There's no acting going on there.
[2564.40 - 2566.40] P:1947.76 E:0.064563 |  That was an injury.
[2566.40 - 2567.40] P:1843.85 E:0.067834 |  But was it Canate?
[2567.40 - 2568.40] P:1899.34 E:0.081380 |  I think it was Canate.
[2568.40 - 2569.40] P:2045.49 E:0.116724 |  Yes, it was. Did he get any of the ball?
[2569.40 - 2571.40] P:1907.46 E:0.071739 |  He's also down as well, Pat Canate.
[2571.40 - 2573.40] P:1840.96 E:0.086044 |  So, has he ever gotten any of the ball?
[2573.40 - 2577.40] P:1983.18 E:0.062562 |  And if there was contact, who initiates the contact?
[2577.40 - 2578.40] P:1971.27 E:0.055646 |  Do you know what?
[2578.40 - 2580.40] P:1855.66 E:0.083803 |  It doesn't look great for Canate.
[2580.40 - 2582.40] P:1893.05 E:0.094163 |  We've got the right angle here.
[2582.40 - 2583.40] P:1897.02 E:0.066353 |  Let's have a look at it.
[2583.40 - 2586.40] P:1921.67 E:0.073789 |  Canate goes for it, gets a bit of the ball first.
[2586.40 - 2587.40] P:2036.48 E:0.071358 |  I think he's okay.
[2587.40 - 2590.40] P:1901.82 E:0.077069 |  I think he's going to say he gets away with it.
[2590.40 - 2592.40] P:1742.37 E:0.081112 |  But he doesn't get a lot of the ball clean.
[2592.40 - 2593.40] P:1962.41 E:0.090222 |  He catches it with his shin.
[2593.40 - 2595.40] P:1912.55 E:0.077395 |  Yeah, that's probably enough.
[2595.40 - 2598.40] P:1922.79 E:0.087888 |  As the cross comes in from the right-hand side from Johnson,
[2598.40 - 2602.40] P:1825.80 E:0.088347 |  Canate is attacking it with Tel coming in from behind him.
[2602.40 - 2606.40] P:1965.29 E:0.090301 |  And Canate goes to ground and is trying to sweep the ball away.
[2606.40 - 2609.40] P:2041.10 E:0.085128 |  And probably does just get enough before catching his tail.
[2609.40 - 2613.40] P:1856.54 E:0.082029 |  I would say, confidently normally, that's not a penalty kick.
[2613.40 - 2615.40] P:1837.40 E:0.105385 |  There are so many times in a season where I've thought
[2615.40 - 2617.40] P:1794.28 E:0.086594 |  something's confidently, something the referee's disagreed,
[2617.40 - 2621.40] P:1905.19 E:0.074531 |  but no chance that should be a penalty kick.
[2621.40 - 2624.40] P:1903.78 E:0.090123 |  Tel is back on his feet. Canate is hobbling.
[2624.40 - 2626.40] P:1845.09 E:0.074812 |  Good move though, wasn't it?
[2626.40 - 2627.40] P:1925.47 E:0.057752 |  It was a great move.
[2627.40 - 2631.40] P:1851.18 E:0.067885 |  And we're in the best moments that Spurs have had in this period.
[2631.40 - 2635.40] P:1877.59 E:0.090466 |  And just before halftime, had they managed to get it back to 3-2?
[2635.40 - 2637.40] P:1912.14 E:0.073432 |  Yeah, they've changed the atmosphere.
[2637.40 - 2639.40] P:1723.00 E:0.064695 |  Well, one more little.
[2639.40 - 2642.40] P:1766.05 E:0.074832 |  But also, I mean, not only did they take the lead,
[2642.40 - 2645.40] P:1800.86 E:0.085590 |  but Szilanki has also had a looping header tipped over by Alisson.
[2645.40 - 2647.40] P:1738.52 E:0.081303 |  I think Alisson was in control of that.
[2647.40 - 2651.40] P:1811.29 E:0.073400 |  That, on this occasion, I don't think Liverpool were completely in control of the situation.
[2651.40 - 2653.40] P:1941.79 E:0.092503 |  Robertson forward for Liverpool.
[2653.40 - 2655.40] P:1831.45 E:0.092402 |  His low cross into the penalty area.
[2655.40 - 2657.40] P:1755.05 E:0.072179 |  Archie Gray couldn't get there.
[2657.40 - 2662.40] P:1855.11 E:0.068670 |  And then coming out with the ball was Udagi to Spence under pressure
[2662.40 - 2664.40] P:1882.63 E:0.101233 |  because of Liverpool pressing.
[2664.40 - 2665.40] P:1959.38 E:0.111715 |  And Robertson almost got there.
[2665.40 - 2668.40] P:1891.35 E:0.098322 |  Now Udagi has actually stayed forward on this near side the right.
[2668.40 - 2672.40] P:2015.25 E:0.099829 |  And McAllister comes across and stops him in his tracks
[2672.40 - 2674.40] P:2017.09 E:0.105273 |  with a committed sliding challenge out for a throw.
[2674.40 - 2676.40] P:2041.67 E:0.089398 |  Liverpool lead 3-1.
[2676.40 - 2678.40] P:1945.89 E:0.089311 |  He's having one of those M-days, isn't he?
[2678.40 - 2681.40] P:1781.48 E:0.094248 |  McAllister, he's absolutely having one of those days.
[2681.40 - 2684.40] P:1864.02 E:0.077726 |  Every tackle has been nailed.
[2684.40 - 2686.40] P:1923.03 E:0.077719 |  He's timed it brilliantly.
[2686.40 - 2688.40] P:1801.78 E:0.099065 |  He's got an absolute world day as well.
[2688.40 - 2691.40] P:1959.96 E:0.076679 |  He is flying out there in the middle of that part.
[2691.40 - 2693.40] P:1829.22 E:0.076004 |  I mean, he's had a lot of great games this season, but...
[2693.40 - 2696.40] P:1907.99 E:0.072249 |  And then he's right up there for a possible man-to-match.
[2696.40 - 2698.40] P:1806.57 E:0.055067 |  This early on.
[2698.40 - 2701.40] P:1855.22 E:0.076720 |  Spence to Johnson on the stretch was Gray.
[2701.40 - 2705.40] P:1876.19 E:0.087056 |  Triangle of passing movements from the Tottenham players on this near side the right
[2705.40 - 2707.40] P:1814.17 E:0.057556 |  in front of the main stand.
[2707.40 - 2711.40] P:1942.80 E:0.083447 |  And Gray passes the ball back towards Dancer, who will come forward.
[2711.40 - 2713.40] P:1992.30 E:0.093747 |  He instructs somebody to go into the midfield ahead of him.
[2713.40 - 2716.40] P:1774.25 E:0.079260 |  In the end, he goes back towards Ben Davis, out towards Madison,
[2716.40 - 2720.40] P:1955.21 E:0.086106 |  Udagi is gone in field, so he passes the ball towards Tell,
[2720.40 - 2723.40] P:1987.26 E:0.102390 |  who runs forward on that left towards the byline and sends over across.
[2723.40 - 2729.40] P:1990.41 E:0.082221 |  And it's stopped there by Allison, as we are into four minutes of added-on time here at Anfield.
[2729.40 - 2733.40] P:1964.55 E:0.084240 |  Liverpool fell behind, but they're on course for a record each week.
[2733.40 - 2735.40] P:1843.41 E:0.063874 |  20th title as they now lead 3-1.
[2735.40 - 2738.40] P:1723.96 E:0.076557 |  She's not to forget that the last couple of minutes
[2738.40 - 2740.40] P:1652.09 E:0.086817 |  first have looked a little bit dangerous.
[2740.40 - 2743.40] P:1896.45 E:0.076467 |  They've got down the right-hand side and the left-hand side, got crosses from the byline.
[2743.40 - 2746.40] P:1765.07 E:0.078259 |  So, you know, they've not given up on this at all yet.
[2746.40 - 2749.40] P:1852.39 E:0.075593 |  The problem that they've got is a number of problems.
[2749.40 - 2754.40] P:1952.77 E:0.079509 |  When they'll measure two goals behind, number two problem, which is a quite big problem.
[2754.40 - 2758.40] P:1825.94 E:0.076635 |  You're playing in the Cop if you're Liverpool in the second half, and they quite enjoy that.
[2758.40 - 2762.40] P:1724.01 E:0.083999 |  So, there's the proverbial mountain to claim first post, but they'll try.
[2762.40 - 2766.40] P:1744.43 E:0.087196 |  And not only that, Pat, but Liverpool have scored more goals in the second half this season
[2766.40 - 2773.40] P:1864.80 E:0.074934 |  than any other side. They've scored 42 of their 75 goals after half-time.
[2773.40 - 2778.40] P:1966.70 E:0.089585 |  Rather ominous statistic, one would suggest, as Gakpo's curling ball is caught by Vicario,
[2778.40 - 2783.40] P:1967.04 E:0.094235 |  in the sunshine, and then he rolls it out underarm towards Udagi over on that far side.
[2783.40 - 2787.40] P:1958.62 E:0.086088 |  Earlier in the Premier League, Bournemouth won Manchester United won.
[2787.40 - 2790.40] P:2073.01 E:0.073715 |  Manchester United, like Spurs, will focus on that Europa League.
[2790.40 - 2793.40] P:1872.80 E:0.110461 |  Semi-final on Thursday night will be live in Bilbao.
[2793.40 - 2798.40] P:1884.15 E:0.083755 |  48 hours before that will be live in North London for Arsenal against Paris Saint-Germain,
[2798.40 - 2802.40] P:1948.12 E:0.081229 |  which should be a mouth-watering contest in the Champions League.
[2802.40 - 2807.40] P:1911.31 E:0.074215 |  But this is the Premier League. We're in first half stoppage time, 3-1 Liverpool.
[2807.40 - 2813.40] P:1832.24 E:0.077406 |  Just as you were chatting there, McAllister's made a tackle on the back of Comus on Madison there.
[2813.40 - 2817.40] P:1669.78 E:0.077883 |  And it's one of those ones where he goes in, and if he doesn't get the ball,
[2817.40 - 2821.40] P:1824.02 E:0.076705 |  the player's going to be... He's going to feel it. He's going to remember it.
[2821.40 - 2825.40] P:1739.13 E:0.083264 |  It's not costing me a little bit there, but it's one of those ones that a defensive midfielder
[2825.40 - 2830.40] P:1791.87 E:0.070893 |  loves to put in there, to put, as they say, a marker on the game.
[2830.40 - 2833.40] P:1835.15 E:0.075954 |  Well, Madison stands alone over the free kick.
[2833.40 - 2836.40] P:1787.97 E:0.084110 |  Liverpool have got a line of red on the edge of the penalty area, in front of the cock.
[2836.40 - 2840.40] P:1883.41 E:0.084655 |  Ball goes out to a doggie, plays it back inside to Madison.
[2840.40 - 2844.40] P:1871.66 E:0.094300 |  Madison then feeds it to the feet of a doggie who can run into the penalty area with a cutback.
[2844.40 - 2848.40] P:1862.79 E:0.094255 |  This is Tal, gets the shot away, flick away by Van Dyke to clear it.
[2848.40 - 2851.40] P:1937.99 E:0.096636 |  Bergbal runs forward, left-hand side of the area rolls down his chest,
[2851.40 - 2854.40] P:1981.05 E:0.097034 |  runs into trouble with Savoslai, but he shows his strength.
[2854.40 - 2857.40] P:1999.99 E:0.093058 |  Bergbal chips over the cross, no-bid there to miss it.
[2857.40 - 2860.40] P:2041.09 E:0.101192 |  Runs out of play for a goal kick. Liverpool leave 3-1 in stoppage time.
[2860.40 - 2862.40] P:1959.70 E:0.090475 |  Yeah, but it will, Don Sprozz again.
[2862.40 - 2866.40] P:1919.42 E:0.077521 |  It's been a long time and just a few minutes, a got to the byline, got dangerous crosses in.
[2866.40 - 2868.40] P:1876.59 E:0.087471 |  So they haven't given up, they're not folded.
[2868.40 - 2871.40] P:1938.22 E:0.071082 |  I mean, you said after the third goal, you know, you don't want an absolute
[2871.40 - 2874.40] P:1948.01 E:0.071171 |  hamening of your Spurs with this massive game coming up.
[2874.40 - 2877.40] P:1844.91 E:0.080230 |  But it's not looked like that since then, you know, it's not that Liverpool
[2877.40 - 2881.40] P:1860.32 E:0.072353 |  have taken the foot off the gas, it's the fact that Spurs haven't given up,
[2881.40 - 2883.40] P:1864.55 E:0.067569 |  they've kept going.
[2883.40 - 2885.40] P:1859.64 E:0.075179 |  Haven't said that, the 3-1 down.
[2885.40 - 2891.40] P:1889.86 E:0.073336 |  And as we were watching there, Daniel Levy was looking pensive, shall we say.
[2891.40 - 2895.40] P:1866.65 E:0.087414 |  Well, it does look increasingly likely that there will be a parting of the ways
[2895.40 - 2899.40] P:1953.77 E:0.068465 |  coming the end of the season with Ange-Poster Coglut.
[2899.40 - 2905.40] P:2037.24 E:0.058519 |  Two years that he's had in charge and yet he could.
[2905.40 - 2910.40] P:1924.04 E:0.066147 |  It was Wander Ramos, who was the last Tottenham manager to win some silverware
[2910.40 - 2912.40] P:1927.15 E:0.056174 |  back in 2008.
[2912.40 - 2918.40] P:1877.72 E:0.049715 |  Ange-Poster Coglut could yet depart on a high.
[2918.40 - 2923.40] P:1909.40 E:0.049971 |  Indeed, if that does occur in a few weeks' time.
[2923.40 - 2928.40] P:1845.87 E:0.075880 |  The 3-1 down here is Gravenberg, almost overruns it, gets away from Tel,
[2928.40 - 2933.40] P:1963.65 E:0.077933 |  but then is stopped by Udagi, passes the ball inside towards Madison,
[2933.40 - 2939.40] P:2013.71 E:0.090124 |  runs into a cul-de-sac of red shirts and it's cleared away by Trent Alexander-Arnold.
[2939.40 - 2944.40] P:1918.65 E:0.076005 |  You know, that is one area where Liverpool have made that tweak from Arneslott,
[2944.40 - 2946.40] P:1986.23 E:0.072622 |  they have tightened up defensively.
[2946.40 - 2951.40] P:1791.16 E:0.075259 |  In that central defensive midfield area, we are going on there a bit,
[2951.40 - 2953.40] P:2006.02 E:0.076521 |  MacArthur, who was slightly out of position.
[2953.40 - 2958.40] P:1934.82 E:0.081072 |  Gravenberg went in absolutely nailed Madison again there.
[2958.40 - 2963.40] P:1956.88 E:0.106435 |  He thought he'd a lot of space to run into, he wouldn't make sure you do the right things
[2963.40 - 2966.40] P:2039.93 E:0.097651 |  all the way to the whistle and have done just that.
[2966.40 - 2971.40] P:2049.93 E:0.097858 |  The half-time whistle sounds and Liverpool are 45 minutes away.
[2971.40 - 2975.40] P:2066.87 E:0.082450 |  The confirmation of the news that we all know is going to happen,
[2975.40 - 2979.40] P:1975.68 E:0.091375 |  they are going to win the title because they fell behind to a Salanki header
[2979.40 - 2982.40] P:1935.06 E:0.086213 |  that gave Spurs the lead after 12 minutes.
[2982.40 - 2989.40] P:2052.07 E:0.070725 |  It lasted all of four minutes before Dias, after a VAR check, had equalised,
[2989.40 - 2994.40] P:2017.60 E:0.088598 |  they then had a goal disallowed, Macalester with a fine, fine effort,
[2994.40 - 2999.40] P:1975.34 E:0.074678 |  after 24 minutes and then Gakpo added a third some 10 minutes later.
[2999.40 - 3004.40] P:1989.76 E:0.070486 |  So half-time at Anfield, Liverpool three, Tottenham hot-spawn one.
[3004.40 - 3008.40] P:2106.02 E:0.085308 |  And let's go straight to Wembley Stadium where the half-time whistle has gone
[3008.40 - 3010.40] P:1975.48 E:0.090284 |  in the FA Cup semi-final, John Southall.
[3010.40 - 3014.40] P:1603.78 E:0.113129 |  Where Steve is knotting in Forest Nill, Manchester City 1 are really impressive,
[3014.40 - 3018.40] P:1667.74 E:0.100527 |  first half from Man City, they have been so dominant, 76% possession
[3018.40 - 3022.40] P:1671.62 E:0.104603 |  and that does not lie but just the one goal inside the first two minutes,
[3022.40 - 3028.40] P:1830.31 E:0.105116 |  Rico Lurs giving too much time and space in the D and he finished into the bottom left-hand corner.
[3028.40 - 3032.40] P:1816.17 E:0.103799 |  Two struck one over the bar from 30 yards and Nico O'Reilly had a shot wide
[3032.40 - 3037.40] P:1822.41 E:0.099680 |  from a similar distance, Forrest yet to have a shot, big job for their manager,
[3037.40 - 3040.40] P:1672.15 E:0.087963 |  Nuno at half-time, Forrest Nill, Manchester City 1.
[3040.40 - 3044.40] P:2034.86 E:0.085686 |  Thank you very much John, we'll be back with John Murray and Clinton Morrison at Wembley
[3044.40 - 3046.40] P:1944.74 E:0.080481 |  before second half commentary here at Anfield.
[3046.40 - 3051.40] P:2025.58 E:0.085270 |  Remember five sports extra for knotting in Forest Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final,
[3051.40 - 3056.40] P:2034.09 E:0.088270 |  here on Five Live, Liverpool leading Tottenham hot-spawn at half-time.
[3056.40 - 3059.40] P:2264.21 E:0.092555 |  A game remember which they only need to draw to secure the title
[3059.40 - 3063.40] P:2043.69 E:0.077104 |  but they are three-one up having gone one-nil down, didn't we just say Pat Nevin
[3063.40 - 3067.40] P:2201.00 E:0.077422 |  that it isn't always straightforward albeit it's starting to look it now?
[3067.40 - 3071.40] P:1812.53 E:0.077289 |  Yeah, I mean they go the goal down and a question has been asked,
[3071.40 - 3075.40] P:1797.18 E:0.064789 |  that question has been asked a lot of Liverpool this season,
[3075.40 - 3078.40] P:1813.00 E:0.084653 |  they have generally had a very good answer to it which is going to score more goals
[3078.40 - 3082.40] P:1836.46 E:0.081128 |  and they've done it really well, I mean on the right-hand side there was periods of time there
[3082.40 - 3086.40] P:1861.80 E:0.071315 |  and when he fancied it, Salah looked unstoppable there
[3086.40 - 3090.40] P:1891.34 E:0.080064 |  and of course it led to the opening goal which can open the floodgates
[3090.40 - 3094.40] P:1920.29 E:0.067825 |  but I've been so impressed with the work rate, the closing down,
[3094.40 - 3097.40] P:1832.18 E:0.084931 |  it's one of the strange things to say about football,
[3097.40 - 3100.40] P:1966.79 E:0.073995 |  do you see a team of horrible to play against,
[3100.40 - 3103.40] P:1852.61 E:0.086058 |  it's one of the biggest compliments you can get from them,
[3103.40 - 3107.40] P:1819.96 E:0.079899 |  it is a big compliment and you look at MacArthur and you look at Gravenbergen
[3107.40 - 3110.40] P:1876.13 E:0.085263 |  and you think, oh they'd be horrible because they can play,
[3110.40 - 3115.40] P:1845.49 E:0.081936 |  they're not holdable, they're hard, they work hard, they cover constantly,
[3115.40 - 3120.40] P:1869.87 E:0.075943 |  those two have been staggeringly impressive today as a duo.
[3120.40 - 3123.40] P:1903.19 E:0.076410 |  It's quite often you buy players, I mean obviously some boys like Graves,
[3123.40 - 3126.40] P:1907.26 E:0.079830 |  well and Gacpo's helping them there when they need to,
[3126.40 - 3130.40] P:1926.62 E:0.078141 |  but when you get two players who seem to know each other and work off each other
[3130.40 - 3133.40] P:1897.05 E:0.085384 |  and they will understand each other's game as well as not looking after themselves,
[3133.40 - 3137.40] P:1896.09 E:0.076886 |  that shows wisdom and game knowledge and game management.
[3137.40 - 3141.40] P:1833.65 E:0.079381 |  So I'm impressed with lots and lots of things about Liverpool today
[3141.40 - 3144.40] P:1894.87 E:0.059521 |  but them too, they've been pretty special.
[3144.40 - 3148.40] P:1966.70 E:0.091157 |  We're on air until 7 o'clock from here inside Anfield
[3148.40 - 3151.40] P:1888.93 E:0.093514 |  so after the full-time whistle assuming Liverpool go on and do it,
[3151.40 - 3156.40] P:1983.47 E:0.089414 |  we'll have lots of time to break it all down, to pay tribute to all of the key players
[3156.40 - 3159.40] P:1940.71 E:0.084212 |  and the manager and all of that kind of thing.
[3159.40 - 3162.40] P:2005.24 E:0.087371 |  But just for now, I do want to pick up again on McAllister
[3162.40 - 3166.40] P:1911.00 E:0.083267 |  because he can be the feather when he needs to be the feather
[3166.40 - 3168.40] P:2188.80 E:0.087942 |  and he's the anvil when he needs to be the anvil.
[3168.40 - 3172.40] P:1801.79 E:0.082810 |  There's just not that many players that have got that, you know, the entirety of it.
[3172.40 - 3176.40] P:1866.86 E:0.076982 |  I mean I would have to say Declan Rice can do all the things you need to do
[3176.40 - 3180.40] P:1886.29 E:0.075509 |  and he's probably getting certain things that maybe even McAllister hasn't got,
[3180.40 - 3184.40] P:1784.78 E:0.088788 |  you know, the low-pitched ride going forward, maybe a wee bit more dangerous sometimes going that way.
[3184.40 - 3188.40] P:1891.33 E:0.075949 |  But it's to take nothing away from the fact that there's not that many players.
[3188.40 - 3191.40] P:1968.53 E:0.073803 |  A lot of players are very specialist these days.
[3191.40 - 3194.40] P:1936.24 E:0.088836 |  But you almost think, yeah, I'll play you anywhere mate, you'll be fine.
[3194.40 - 3197.40] P:1924.61 E:0.092733 |  It's one of the great things over the years that Liverpool have had that,
[3197.40 - 3200.40] P:1905.96 E:0.078387 |  when they've had great sides, they've had certain players, you know,
[3200.40 - 3204.40] P:1893.71 E:0.082509 |  I was telling Stealthby Ronnie Wheeling before, he could do that sort of stuff all the time.
[3204.40 - 3207.40] P:1855.60 E:0.072940 |  You'd have certain players where it doesn't matter where he play,
[3207.40 - 3213.40] P:1983.97 E:0.078537 |  but when you play him in his right position, he is very, very special and he controls games
[3213.40 - 3215.40] P:1928.30 E:0.082594 |  and he hurts people as soon as back in those days.
[3215.40 - 3220.40] P:1793.17 E:0.087457 |  There are a great number of... I want to mention these names because they were that good,
[3220.40 - 3223.40] P:1917.02 E:0.067293 |  that it's good to be mentioned in their company.
[3223.40 - 3228.40] P:1920.10 E:0.079573 |  McAllister's there, absolutely he's there, not he will be there, he is there now.
[3228.40 - 3233.40] P:1857.09 E:0.080286 |  And today he just underlines it, but if anyone deserved a goal, you know,
[3233.40 - 3238.40] P:1901.06 E:0.079151 |  to be the goal that really turned it today, had to be a cast and it was a cracker.
[3238.40 - 3242.40] P:1932.01 E:0.082804 |  And just come back to what I said before the game, you know, you want to be stylish,
[3242.40 - 3245.40] P:1918.86 E:0.096263 |  you want to be a good game, you want to get a game you win, you want to score goals.
[3245.40 - 3249.40] P:1955.78 E:0.068450 |  And if you... The absolute cherry in the top of it is...
[3249.40 - 3252.40] P:1818.13 E:0.069413 |  And some crackers as well. And you've got that.
[3252.40 - 3258.40] P:1891.88 E:0.074940 |  It's one of those things here inside Anfield where one absolutely spectacular goal,
[3258.40 - 3261.40] P:1979.62 E:0.086404 |  plenty of good goals, one brilliant one from McAllister,
[3261.40 - 3265.40] P:2139.49 E:0.083772 |  it's the kind of moment that you just know somewhere, someday,
[3265.40 - 3267.40] P:2083.36 E:0.084384 |  some Liverpool fan is going to write a song about it.
[3267.40 - 3270.40] P:2060.50 E:0.097294 |  On the way into Anfield, I could hear the Liverpool supporters singing
[3270.40 - 3274.40] P:2069.33 E:0.082967 |  D'Vocari-Gi's song to the tune of Saturday Night by Wigfield.
[3274.40 - 3278.40] P:2040.60 E:0.084231 |  I can't say the second line of that song, but it was about that amazing night
[3278.40 - 3281.40] P:2112.87 E:0.087266 |  here against Barcelona all those years ago.
[3281.40 - 3286.40] P:2177.48 E:0.091822 |  There's a rainbow which is just appearing amidst the water from the sprinklers
[3286.40 - 3290.40] P:1990.35 E:0.078196 |  as it just cascades down onto the turf here at Anfield.
[3290.40 - 3296.40] P:2088.75 E:0.087005 |  Glorious first half for Liverpool, leading 3-1, only needing a point.
[3296.40 - 3299.40] P:2070.20 E:0.087730 |  Remember Chelsea have been knocked out of the Women's Champions League today,
[3299.40 - 3303.40] P:2042.50 E:0.090883 |  they were beaten at Stanford Bridge by Barcelona 4-1 to 8-2 on aggregate.
[3303.40 - 3308.40] P:2024.62 E:0.085348 |  The second semi-final is well underway, Arsenal at Lyon.
[3308.40 - 3312.40] P:2092.88 E:0.093938 |  Last we heard, Arsenal had levelled it up on aggregate, Victoria Polley.
[3312.40 - 3315.40] P:1851.64 E:0.092561 |  They have indeed, it's Lyon, Niel, Arsenal 1-1,
[3315.40 - 3319.40] P:1790.72 E:0.096854 |  Arsenal starting how they meaning to go on scoring in the first five minutes.
[3319.40 - 3322.40] P:1880.46 E:0.090552 |  It was a corner that came in, knocked out by the Lyon defence
[3322.40 - 3325.40] P:1763.62 E:0.097454 |  and ended up going in off the Lyon keeper, Christiane Endler.
[3325.40 - 3328.40] P:1939.08 E:0.094447 |  And it's very much been a tale of the two goalkeepers,
[3328.40 - 3330.40] P:1731.89 E:0.086594 |  because at the other end, Daphne von Damselaar,
[3330.40 - 3334.40] P:1818.83 E:0.091083 |  returning in goal for Arsenal, came to claim a ball, didn't get there,
[3334.40 - 3338.40] P:1834.44 E:0.091315 |  and Lyon almost equalised through captain Wendy Reynard,
[3338.40 - 3341.40] P:1840.20 E:0.103829 |  but she fired over, it's Lyon, Niel, Arsenal 1-1,
[3341.40 - 3344.40] P:1815.08 E:0.084338 |  we're over halfway through the first half, it's 2-2 on aggregate.
[3344.40 - 3347.40] P:1940.87 E:0.093796 |  Oh, we're at some glorious sporting arenas today.
[3347.40 - 3352.40] P:1967.61 E:0.093257 |  Beautiful day inside Anfield, we're at Wembley Stadium,
[3352.40 - 3355.40] P:1986.49 E:0.094496 |  and it doesn't get much better than the crucible either,

[3358.40 - 3361.40] P:1845.58 E:0.082715 |  No, fantastic venue, Steve, and Ronny O'Sullivan is closing in
[3361.40 - 3363.40] P:1791.33 E:0.081632 |  on a place in the quarter-finals.

[3370.40 - 3374.40] P:1861.22 E:0.078149 |  with 13 the target for victory, O'Sullivan knocked in breaks of 79,

[3387.40 - 3390.40] P:1867.35 E:0.083533 |  Both of those matches will be played to a finish tomorrow night.

[3547.40 - 3555.40] P:1724.06 E:0.110432 |  Well, I think we can more or less safely say that Liverpool's Premier League winning party
[3555.40 - 3557.40] P:1906.73 E:0.087711 |  is less than an hour away.
[3557.40 - 3562.40] P:2056.41 E:0.098724 |  How close are we to knowing who's going to be meeting Crystal Palace, though,
[3562.40 - 3564.40] P:1867.48 E:0.082233 |  in the FA Cup final? John Murray.
[3564.40 - 3569.40] P:1817.03 E:0.091917 |  Well, half-time here at Wembley, it is Nottingham Forest Nill, Manchester City 1.
[3569.40 - 3575.40] P:1994.50 E:0.087537 |  Manchester City scored the early goal, very good finish from Rico Lewis and the D
[3575.40 - 3578.40] P:1972.79 E:0.091873 |  on the edge of the area, low shot past cells into the bottom corner.
[3578.40 - 3580.40] P:1906.93 E:0.080517 |  And that was only in the second minute,
[3580.40 - 3584.40] P:1954.35 E:0.082558 |  and City then proceeded to absolutely dominate the match.
[3584.40 - 3587.40] P:1935.02 E:0.092425 |  Without, I should say, coming close to a second goal,
[3587.40 - 3593.40] P:1950.44 E:0.079311 |  there has only been one attempt on target in the match, the Lewis goal,
[3593.40 - 3596.40] P:1972.34 E:0.078031 |  and Nottingham Forest have offered nothing.
[3596.40 - 3600.40] P:1890.63 E:0.085677 |  They've seen so little of the ball, and when they have had it, they've done nothing with it.
[3600.40 - 3604.40] P:2006.55 E:0.079882 |  Cell Clinton Morrison, something's got to change from Forrest from Noonal.
[3604.40 - 3606.40] P:1948.39 E:0.083462 |  It has to change, and I've been screaming for it,
[3606.40 - 3609.40] P:1894.06 E:0.084439 |  and it looks like he might be coming on a langage.
[3609.40 - 3611.40] P:1846.41 E:0.086398 |  I just look at Man City's high back line, I'm thinking,
[3611.40 - 3613.40] P:1836.14 E:0.091293 |  they don't have enough runners who can go in behind.
[3613.40 - 3615.40] P:1944.42 E:0.083452 |  He's one of the quickest in the Premier League.
[3615.40 - 3617.40] P:1935.42 E:0.091103 |  You needed to change it because you were right.
[3617.40 - 3619.40] P:1808.09 E:0.086239 |  They were powered up off, they didn't, they didn't,
[3619.40 - 3621.40] P:1890.57 E:0.075743 |  I'm getting behind Man City at all.
[3621.40 - 3626.40] P:1837.53 E:0.084305 |  Man City, as you said, dominated possession without actually working cells that much.
[3626.40 - 3629.40] P:1821.33 E:0.074159 |  And Forrest have been neither nothing nor something, have they?
[3629.40 - 3631.40] P:1860.58 E:0.076298 |  Yeah, it's been half-hearted, hasn't it?
[3631.40 - 3634.40] P:1994.07 E:0.079358 |  We're there, but we're not really pressing.
[3634.40 - 3638.40] P:1945.11 E:0.080465 |  We're letting Covetich and Bernardo Silva, who people say legs have gone, dominate.
[3638.40 - 3641.40] P:1943.80 E:0.072981 |  Go move up the field, ten yards further up the field,
[3641.40 - 3644.40] P:1902.86 E:0.083836 |  and go and press Man City, and go and cause them problems.
[3644.40 - 3648.40] P:1878.21 E:0.085338 |  But it couldn't be any more obvious that a langage is coming on for the second half,
[3648.40 - 3651.40] P:1904.27 E:0.081589 |  because he came out to warm up in his match shirt,
[3651.40 - 3654.40] P:1933.56 E:0.078504 |  he's now taken off his tracksuit bottoms, he has ready,
[3654.40 - 3657.40] P:1974.27 E:0.091930 |  he's got it kit on, it's his 23rd birthday today,
[3657.40 - 3659.40] P:1885.04 E:0.081793 |  and he's ready to go.
[3659.40 - 3661.40] P:2027.33 E:0.068272 |  Yeah, and he's been brilliant this season,
[3661.40 - 3664.40] P:1957.28 E:0.084411 |  and he gives, you ask any defender, they don't like playing against Pace,
[3664.40 - 3666.40] P:1935.88 E:0.078618 |  and he's one of the quickest around, so, yeah,
[3666.40 - 3669.40] P:1866.75 E:0.082931 |  Forrest are hoping, and the fans and the players, his teammates,
[3669.40 - 3672.40] P:1921.09 E:0.088819 |  hoping he could get a birthday goal, because it'll be fitting for him,
[3672.40 - 3674.40] P:1904.59 E:0.075326 |  I think he's had an outstanding season for them.
[3674.40 - 3677.40] P:1845.80 E:0.086469 |  Yeah, and my goodness, they do need something, nothing of Forrest,
[3677.40 - 3680.40] P:1929.48 E:0.090122 |  because if it continues as it was in the first half,
[3680.40 - 3684.40] P:1896.34 E:0.084821 |  Manchester City will score a second goal, they'll win this semi-final,
[3684.40 - 3689.40] P:1882.10 E:0.084481 |  and it will be Crystal Palace against Manchester City here in three weekends time.
[3689.40 - 3694.40] P:1908.30 E:0.083811 |  However, at half-time, it is Nottingham Forrest-Nill, Manchester City one,
[3694.40 - 3696.40] P:1903.08 E:0.089311 |  so it's not over yet.
[3696.40 - 3699.40] P:1938.03 E:0.085121 |  John Clinton, thank you both very much indeed,
[3699.40 - 3704.40] P:1950.90 E:0.088053 |  second half commentary on five sports, extra 6-0-6 starts at 7 o'clock tonight,
[3704.40 - 3709.40] P:1939.49 E:0.091159 |  08-0-8-5, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, Premier League winner, Chris Sutton,
[3709.40 - 3711.40] P:1973.16 E:0.089503 |  big part of the team of course, afternoon, Chris.
[3711.40 - 3714.40] P:1714.31 E:0.104231 |  Hello, Steve, you're not easy winning a Premier League, Steve.
[3714.40 - 3717.40] P:2149.35 E:0.083863 |  No, Liverpool have made it look like that, haven't they?
[3717.40 - 3721.40] P:1681.47 E:0.100643 |  No, they have, I mean, you know, that's the headline of today's bill,
[3721.40 - 3725.40] P:1723.30 E:0.088385 |  it'll be party time, Tottenham will not come back into this game,
[3725.40 - 3729.40] P:1910.60 E:0.091762 |  we can't see it, and they have made it look pretty routine, Steve,
[3729.40 - 3732.40] P:1567.25 E:0.096428 |  haven't they, this season? They've blown everybody away,
[3732.40 - 3736.40] P:1835.73 E:0.086172 |  Harneslotz first season, and I suppose that the question is,
[3736.40 - 3739.40] P:1861.50 E:0.096221 |  celebrate this season, what's been special about it,
[3739.40 - 3744.40] P:1889.03 E:0.084135 |  but can they carry on under Harneslotz and dominate?
[3744.40 - 3746.40] P:2040.31 E:0.037997 |  Do you think they can?
[3746.40 - 3751.40] P:1885.27 E:0.094240 |  Oh, it's difficult because we expect Manchester City to respond,
[3751.40 - 3754.40] P:1716.21 E:0.095080 |  I mean, I'm on with Roman Kemp tonight, he likes his Arsenal,
[3754.40 - 3759.40] P:1824.58 E:0.081017 |  you know, he's an Arsenal fan, and everybody thought this would be
[3759.40 - 3762.40] P:1845.25 E:0.096740 |  the season for Arsenal, and they've fallen away,
[3762.40 - 3765.40] P:1839.77 E:0.079226 |  but of course they've got the Champions League, haven't they,
[3765.40 - 3768.40] P:1751.41 E:0.089281 |  which will, you know, if they win that all will be forgiven with the Premier League,
[3768.40 - 3772.40] P:1816.56 E:0.080307 |  but the signing of, you know, getting the Salah deal done,
[3772.40 - 3775.40] P:1802.03 E:0.090896 |  and Dyke deal done, they're in a pretty good place,
[3775.40 - 3779.40] P:1846.51 E:0.077326 |  and you know, Liverpool fans must be absolutely delighted with this season,
[3779.40 - 3782.40] P:1877.65 E:0.072699 |  but also looking forward.
[3782.40 - 3785.40] P:2142.65 E:0.097077 |  08, 08, 05, 9, 0, 9, 6, 9, 3, cheers, Chris, have a good one.
[3785.40 - 3786.40] P:1776.28 E:0.095479 |  Thanks, Steve.
[3786.40 - 3789.40] P:2019.52 E:0.084103 |  Chris Sturton, Roman Kemp, 6'06, 7 o'clock tonight,
[3789.40 - 3793.40] P:2101.40 E:0.093595 |  we're live from inside, and Fieldy and Dennis and Pat Nevin are here,
[3793.40 - 3797.40] P:2016.52 E:0.078223 |  Liverpool substitutes just warming up beneath us, I have to say, Pat,
[3797.40 - 3801.40] P:2057.93 E:0.084371 |  this is, I've seen quite a lot of Liverpool live lately,
[3801.40 - 3803.40] P:1986.65 E:0.089949 |  and this is the best I can remember them,
[3803.40 - 3808.40] P:2107.91 E:0.077519 |  probably since just before the first leg of the PSG Champions League title,
[3808.40 - 3811.40] P:2097.95 E:0.084661 |  and I know they won that first leg, but not at their best.
[3811.40 - 3813.40] P:1989.51 E:0.085327 |  I've not seen this Liverpool for quite a while.
[3813.40 - 3819.40] P:1850.87 E:0.078844 |  You know, every team, I've told recently a lot of fans from a lot of different clubs,
[3819.40 - 3824.40] P:1965.27 E:0.079847 |  and every team will go through a dip, go through a dip and don't lose like many games,
[3824.40 - 3827.40] P:1934.95 E:0.091784 |  that's the trick, you know, you might not be playing that brilliantly,
[3827.40 - 3831.40] P:1949.10 E:0.089380 |  you might lose the odd game or draw the odd game here and there.
[3831.40 - 3836.40] P:1921.00 E:0.088665 |  It just happens, you can't be at it for that amount of games for an entirety of a season,
[3836.40 - 3839.40] P:2001.71 E:0.096211 |  so that's what they've done, but you're right, they are their best,
[3839.40 - 3843.40] P:2016.58 E:0.087405 |  they have the best version of Liverpool right at this second,
[3843.40 - 3846.40] P:1930.99 E:0.097823 |  and I think it's because they know how to do it, they know how to time it.
[3846.40 - 3849.40] P:1921.53 E:0.088596 |  You know, Salah knew when it was time to turn it on, he's turned it on.
[3849.40 - 3852.40] P:1910.72 E:0.097409 |  He knew they started this game, you knew they did it back, you won now,
[3852.40 - 3858.40] P:1958.92 E:0.076002 |  he's turned it on, you know, the very, very best players have got gears,
[3858.40 - 3861.40] P:1956.91 E:0.081307 |  and they went through a few today so far, haven't they?
[3861.40 - 3864.40] P:1938.09 E:0.084968 |  And now that they've got three, one up, they can maybe cruise away,
[3864.40 - 3866.40] P:1940.55 E:0.054065 |  but I just don't think they will.
[3866.40 - 3870.40] P:2009.81 E:0.094835 |  The Liverpool players have just finished their pre-second half warm-up,
[3870.40 - 3874.40] P:2086.06 E:0.097163 |  almost look like they were dancing, they'll be doing that in 45 minutes time by the looks of it,
[3874.40 - 3878.40] P:2081.50 E:0.087826 |  Anfield is absolutely ready for a Premier League winning party,
[3878.40 - 3884.40] P:1969.00 E:0.088191 |  will be on air until 7 o'clock, drinking in every moment with Liverpool supporters.
[3884.40 - 3887.40] P:2116.48 E:0.088490 |  They've still got a job to do, but it's certainly half done.
[3887.40 - 3888.40] P:1884.39 E:0.057427 |  Ian.
[3888.40 - 3891.40] P:1942.92 E:0.091815 |  Certainly is, thank you Steve, and I would imagine that Arnav Slott,
[3891.40 - 3897.40] P:2000.03 E:0.094902 |  such his focus in the build-up to the game, he hasn't been carried away by any of the emotion.
[3897.40 - 3902.40] P:2004.34 E:0.085841 |  He'll be saying to his players, you keep that laser focus for this second half,
[3902.40 - 3907.40] P:2039.84 E:0.091966 |  go and finish the job, because you're halfway there as the match restarts.
[3908.40 - 3910.40] P:2041.53 E:0.107424 |  Tottenham Hotspur have made two changes,
[3910.40 - 3915.40] P:2011.68 E:0.080932 |  Pepe Sarr replaces Archie Gray in the midfield,
[3915.40 - 3918.40] P:1973.29 E:0.084956 |  and Kuleseski comes on for Madison.
[3918.40 - 3921.40] P:2013.71 E:0.083927 |  So Spurs have the caro in goal, a back four of Spence,
[3921.40 - 3926.40] P:2037.87 E:0.086893 |  Davis Danso and Udogi, Kuleseski, Sarr, Bergvall, Tels, Solanke and Johnson.
[3926.40 - 3930.40] P:2011.16 E:0.078443 |  Liverpool, Spurs incidentally, they're light blue,
[3930.40 - 3932.40] P:1906.18 E:0.081260 |  they're playing from right to left as we look now,
[3932.40 - 3936.40] P:1926.94 E:0.077660 |  so they're defending the cop end, they're attacking the Anfield road end,
[3936.40 - 3941.40] P:1995.57 E:0.080357 |  whereas Liverpool all in red, Allison in goal, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dyke,
[3941.40 - 3945.40] P:1916.61 E:0.091708 |  Kanate Robertson, McAllister, Gravenberg, Serbos Lai,
[3945.40 - 3952.40] P:1955.30 E:0.071252 |  and then Salah Diaz and Cody Gakpo, as Danso plays the ball forward towards Kuleseski,
[3952.40 - 3956.40] P:1926.94 E:0.094517 |  who gets it away to Johnson, flag stays down, Johnson will run forward,
[3956.40 - 3959.40] P:1943.39 E:0.090000 |  and it goes off the legs of Van Dyke, and it's a late flag,
[3959.40 - 3963.40] P:1950.95 E:0.088015 |  so it'll be a free kick, and Liverpool still lead by three goals to one.
[3963.40 - 3966.40] P:1880.60 E:0.085229 |  Back to Wembley in that FA Cup semi-final, John Southall.
[3966.40 - 3969.40] P:1694.86 E:0.110641 |  Forrest Niel, Man City won, but what a chance for Forrest in the opening minutes
[3969.40 - 3972.40] P:1477.38 E:0.108214 |  of the second half, Hudson Adoy down the left-hand side,
[3972.40 - 3976.40] P:1382.15 E:0.113437 |  there was a langer on his serve on his birth, they made the run eight yards out
[3976.40 - 3980.40] P:1795.21 E:0.089804 |  and somehow put it wide, Forrest Niel, Man City won.
[3980.40 - 3985.40] P:2002.41 E:0.074489 |  Talking of Forrest, Liverpool have dropped five points in two games against Nottingham Forrest.
[3985.40 - 3989.40] P:1996.36 E:0.084085 |  Before today, they've dropped 15 points in the other 31 games.
[3989.40 - 3992.40] P:1834.42 E:0.095859 |  It's extraordinary, some teams are your bogey teams,
[3992.40 - 3996.40] P:1858.19 E:0.080806 |  losing the game here, wasn't it? Which was extraordinary,
[3996.40 - 3999.40] P:1807.03 E:0.089678 |  but just looking at the changes that Spurs have made at the moment,
[3999.40 - 4002.40] P:1867.73 E:0.092188 |  they've made two changes in the midfield, that comes as no shock,
[4002.40 - 4006.40] P:1808.24 E:0.095512 |  considering how well the midfield for Liverpool has been playing,
[4006.40 - 4009.40] P:1888.84 E:0.079884 |  with Graven Berk and Mikasa, we were talking about.
[4010.40 - 4013.40] P:2007.44 E:0.101489 |  Pat Nevin is with us here on the World Service, as well as five live-in,
[4013.40 - 4018.40] P:1906.72 E:0.091751 |  the BBC sounds out where Liverpool are leading by three goals to one.
[4018.40 - 4024.40] P:1879.33 E:0.083670 |  The Sun still beating down on at least a third of the pitch here at Anfield,
[4024.40 - 4027.40] P:1900.43 E:0.095416 |  as Canate in the shadows of the main stand towards Salah.
[4027.40 - 4029.40] P:1825.90 E:0.082148 |  Sir Boss Light fouled.
[4029.40 - 4034.40] P:1939.55 E:0.087990 |  Mo Salah actually has scored 11 league goals against Tottenham Hotspur.
[4034.40 - 4038.40] P:1936.91 E:0.078091 |  It is the most of any player in this fixture.
[4038.40 - 4040.40] P:1817.79 E:0.091706 |  He will be desperate to get on the scoresheet.
[4040.40 - 4043.40] P:1858.24 E:0.096703 |  It's possibly the most surprising thing of the afternoon so far,
[4043.40 - 4047.40] P:1751.31 E:0.079384 |  but he hasn't had that goal that he usually gets, but we've got plenty of time yet.
[4047.40 - 4049.40] P:1766.61 E:0.080814 |  He'll be thanking you.
[4049.40 - 4053.40] P:1798.72 E:0.081559 |  If he doesn't score today, it'll be seven without a goal for Mo Salah,
[4053.40 - 4062.40] P:1825.21 E:0.078439 |  which will be almost three years of his longest goal drought for Liverpool.
[4064.40 - 4069.40] P:1904.75 E:0.099462 |  Although we mentioned earlier about Liverpool's tendency to score goals in the second half,
[4069.40 - 4075.40] P:1926.17 E:0.093645 |  20 of his 27 in the Premier League, he is, of course, for the Golden Boot,
[4075.40 - 4078.40] P:1793.21 E:0.079341 |  have come in the second half this season.
[4078.40 - 4082.40] P:1966.30 E:0.091321 |  Sir Boss Light off the chest, tries to swivel and volley the ball forward.
[4082.40 - 4085.40] P:1961.77 E:0.078669 |  A doggie heads it away as he runs back to the edge of his penalty area.
[4085.40 - 4087.40] P:1874.14 E:0.086555 |  Salah in the back, up against Gravenberg.
[4087.40 - 4091.40] P:1976.38 E:0.083996 |  Gravenberg, too strong for him, comes forward with the ball,
[4091.40 - 4095.40] P:2019.55 E:0.092248 |  runs away from Bergvall, feeds it towards Robertson, drills it in low,
[4095.40 - 4099.40] P:2031.01 E:0.096487 |  blocked by Spence, out for Liverpool, throw in front of that Sir Kenny Dalglish,
[4099.40 - 4102.40] P:1891.49 E:0.091308 |  down on the far side, three and a half minutes into the second half,
[4102.40 - 4103.40] P:1857.50 E:0.099956 |  three-one Liverpool.
[4103.40 - 4105.40] P:1744.36 E:0.096171 |  And again, it's that duo again.
[4105.40 - 4109.40] P:1774.21 E:0.087096 |  Gravenberg right beside McAllister when Salah was trying to hold on to the ball,
[4109.40 - 4112.40] P:1917.67 E:0.081935 |  no chance, you ain't getting it, you ain't keeping it.
[4112.40 - 4113.40] P:1885.39 E:0.089071 |  We're going to break.
[4113.40 - 4116.40] P:1792.93 E:0.084537 |  They've been very, very good at getting close,
[4116.40 - 4120.40] P:1779.43 E:0.089797 |  not giving anybody sense to get on the ball and break and hold it up.
[4120.40 - 4122.40] P:1928.96 E:0.057156 |  They've been brilliant at it.
[4122.40 - 4127.40] P:1845.23 E:0.086654 |  Canate to Alexander Arnold, back with Canate in the centre circle.
[4127.40 - 4131.40] P:1785.13 E:0.092944 |  Van Dyke on the halfway line, passes the ball forward towards McAllister.
[4131.40 - 4135.40] P:1892.00 E:0.094749 |  His diagonal ball goes out far side the left, and Gakpo comes in now,
[4135.40 - 4138.40] P:1911.18 E:0.100036 |  that left touch line, left corner of the area, Gakpo still runs in field.
[4138.40 - 4142.40] P:1840.47 E:0.099938 |  He tees up McAllister, McAllister takes a couple of steps back towards Gakpo
[4142.40 - 4144.40] P:1816.29 E:0.112265 |  and unselfishly looked for Salah.
[4144.40 - 4149.40] P:1916.30 E:0.103099 |  He could easily have gone for goal, but they tried to put it on the plate for Salah
[4149.40 - 4151.40] P:1937.04 E:0.093023 |  and the opportunity went missing.
[4151.40 - 4156.40] P:1739.80 E:0.101403 |  I call when the earlier moves, some chess, I'm going beautiful for that one.
[4156.40 - 4158.40] P:1827.17 E:0.088326 |  It was absolutely lovely.
[4158.40 - 4162.40] P:1738.46 E:0.094668 |  One-two's, I mean, classic training ground goal, we would call that.
[4162.40 - 4166.40] P:1623.17 E:0.088823 |  I wonder if there was a possibility at all, say, no, there wasn't.
[4166.40 - 4168.40] P:1613.11 E:0.089946 |  One-two, beautifully done.
[4168.40 - 4170.40] P:1692.37 E:0.071666 |  Actually, more than one, one-two.
[4170.40 - 4173.40] P:1644.67 E:0.081036 |  I'm amazed they didn't go for goal.
[4173.40 - 4176.40] P:1795.29 E:0.087985 |  You're absolutely right, but it would have been the perfect goal,
[4176.40 - 4178.40] P:1850.64 E:0.081138 |  had that final pass been made.
[4178.40 - 4183.40] P:1778.14 E:0.090499 |  And when you hear a commentator or a reporter saying,
[4183.40 - 4186.40] P:1867.64 E:0.099168 |  they walked it into the net, that was almost it, wasn't it?
[4186.40 - 4188.40] P:1922.89 E:0.094443 |  Whether they just cut open the Spurs defence?
[4188.40 - 4190.40] P:1747.77 E:0.084912 |  They are pit-a-me of it, they are absolutely pit-a-me of it.
[4190.40 - 4193.40] P:1651.42 E:0.088803 |  And if you're playing against that, OK, so Liverpool didn't score,
[4193.40 - 4196.40] P:1706.26 E:0.080945 |  but it has a horrible feeling because they didn't panic.
[4196.40 - 4199.40] P:1748.30 E:0.087425 |  McAllister got the ball in the 18-yard line
[4199.40 - 4204.40] P:1737.14 E:0.084784 |  and instead of smashing it, he believed they could do that and they almost did.
[4204.40 - 4207.40] P:1767.48 E:0.101564 |  Choice of listening this afternoon here on Five Live.
[4207.40 - 4210.40] P:1878.61 E:0.100338 |  Liverpool leading Spurs by three goals to one.
[4210.40 - 4215.40] P:1828.81 E:0.100910 |  As the boss lie out towards Salah, Salah runs forward onto his left foot,
[4215.40 - 4218.40] P:1810.15 E:0.081971 |  charged down, and on Sports Extra, it was Noddingham Forest,
[4218.40 - 4221.40] P:1958.33 E:0.103858 |  Nile Manchester City, one, but there's been another goal, John Southall.
[4221.40 - 4224.40] P:1848.74 E:0.106204 |  Big moment here, Noddingham Forest, Nile Manchester City,
[4224.40 - 4228.40] P:1639.70 E:0.112301 |  two, corner on the left-hand side, and there was Josco Guardiola,
[4228.40 - 4231.40] P:1703.70 E:0.090336 |  six yards out to power the head in.
[4231.40 - 4236.40] P:1742.62 E:0.110514 |  Had her in long way back now for Forest, Forest Nile Manchester City, two.
[4236.40 - 4242.40] P:1792.09 E:0.104846 |  Crystal Palace await the winners in the final of the FA Cup on May 17.
[4242.40 - 4246.40] P:1807.18 E:0.099863 |  Arna Slott's name is being chanted by the Liverpool supporters.
[4246.40 - 4254.40] P:1735.29 E:0.080484 |  When they last won the title in front of supporters some 35 years ago,
[4254.40 - 4257.40] P:1886.16 E:0.081402 |  the attendance was just under 38,000.
[4257.40 - 4263.40] P:1762.01 E:0.085951 |  Anfield has been redeveloped since we got that two-tiered stand away at the Anfield road end
[4263.40 - 4265.40] P:1748.65 E:0.096820 |  away towards our left-hand side.
[4265.40 - 4268.40] P:1648.05 E:0.089193 |  The old Kemlen road is now the Sakenidau Gleestand.
[4268.40 - 4271.40] P:1679.21 E:0.105866 |  It's increased considerably here at Anfield,
[4271.40 - 4276.40] P:1765.63 E:0.095878 |  and every single one of them who has been privileged enough to be inside this ground
[4276.40 - 4280.40] P:1915.58 E:0.088723 |  for this special significant moment in Liverpool's illustrious history,
[4280.40 - 4284.40] P:1850.34 E:0.096933 |  he's going to enjoy every second in the second half as a low cross comes in
[4284.40 - 4286.40] P:1962.46 E:0.100908 |  and it goes behind for a corner kick.
[4286.40 - 4291.40] P:1912.37 E:0.095342 |  And it's one of those moments that psychology of the Cop is now working.
[4291.40 - 4295.40] P:1833.75 E:0.088621 |  You just look at that Spurs team, they are falling further and further back,
[4295.40 - 4299.40] P:1781.16 E:0.093569 |  being dragged back by the history of what the Cop does
[4299.40 - 4301.40] P:1834.35 E:0.095533 |  to the Liverpool players themselves.
[4301.40 - 4304.40] P:1822.67 E:0.083988 |  They just grow in the second half, they own the pitch.
[4304.40 - 4307.40] P:1840.63 E:0.082577 |  And at the moment Spurs aren't going to snuff,
[4307.40 - 4309.40] P:1782.06 E:0.105793 |  they're not going anywhere nearer than one-half.
[4309.40 - 4312.40] P:1832.92 E:0.088136 |  So this is a 10-foot slope from one side to the other.
[4314.40 - 4319.40] P:1864.11 E:0.102412 |  Liverpool have only lost one in their last 30 league games against Tottenham-Hotspur
[4319.40 - 4322.40] P:1818.82 E:0.099087 |  and they're in no position to surrender.
[4322.40 - 4326.40] P:1837.20 E:0.092811 |  The comfortable position that they find themselves in here this afternoon
[4326.40 - 4328.40] P:1955.97 E:0.088600 |  is being played on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[4328.40 - 4332.40] P:1972.88 E:0.088439 |  As our referee Thomas Bramble just has a wanderer cross into the technical area.
[4332.40 - 4336.40] P:1940.55 E:0.089207 |  I think that's Sa and Lewis Diaz who are getting very tight.
[4336.40 - 4338.40] P:2067.41 E:0.082718 |  The corner on the left is taken short,
[4338.40 - 4340.40] P:2055.22 E:0.083572 |  so Boss Lylin with a cross at the far post,
[4340.40 - 4344.40] P:2039.92 E:0.092078 |  it's headed behind by a backpedaling Kevin Danso,
[4344.40 - 4347.40] P:2027.73 E:0.087319 |  it's another corner kick, but on this near side the right,
[4347.40 - 4350.40] P:2024.07 E:0.090140 |  in front of those expectant Liverpool supporters,
[4350.40 - 4352.40] P:1857.59 E:0.060914 |  so many of them get out in red.
[4352.40 - 4355.40] P:1831.05 E:0.097664 |  One of the great things about Liverpool, it's a very simple corner,
[4355.40 - 4358.40] P:1981.17 E:0.094692 |  just out to a player who's maybe 15 yards out there,
[4358.40 - 4361.40] P:1986.98 E:0.104804 |  it's a quality of all you genuinely get in.
[4361.40 - 4363.40] P:1929.69 E:0.103630 |  And it doesn't really matter who it is,
[4363.40 - 4367.40] P:1821.97 E:0.101060 |  if it's Salah, if it's Robertson, that's the thing that's supposed to be right.
[4367.40 - 4371.40] P:1836.46 E:0.108555 |  You know Macalester's going to do the quality of the crosses in and be superb.
[4373.40 - 4376.40] P:1843.77 E:0.109947 |  Macalester's name is the latest to be chanted,
[4376.40 - 4378.40] P:1855.88 E:0.105632 |  they're going through the full repertoire,
[4378.40 - 4381.40] P:1784.27 E:0.089837 |  or at least they will do in this second half.
[4381.40 - 4384.40] P:1931.43 E:0.091208 |  Corner kick to Liverpool, Macalester to take it right footed.
[4384.40 - 4387.40] P:1885.89 E:0.092793 |  It's an out-swinger, Canate was up, might fall to Van Dijk,
[4387.40 - 4391.40] P:1921.60 E:0.087015 |  hooked away by Danso, looping ball, high drops,
[4391.40 - 4394.40] P:2038.69 E:0.082371 |  Tel, Tussles with the Boss Lylin,
[4394.40 - 4398.40] P:2042.34 E:0.099594 |  who squeaks the ball out towards Macalester, Salah wants it,
[4398.40 - 4401.40] P:1957.94 E:0.099648 |  Macalester shoots, takes an inflection, should go out for a corner,
[4401.40 - 4404.40] P:1973.97 E:0.101377 |  indeed it is Liverpool piling on the pressure, 3-1.
[4405.40 - 4409.40] P:1932.88 E:0.094147 |  I'm going to say it because you have to put in more Salah there shouldn't you?
[4409.40 - 4412.40] P:1897.80 E:0.086398 |  He's shot there, Salah's on his outside there,
[4412.40 - 4416.40] P:1801.44 E:0.092754 |  he's got nobody with him, no Salah will be in an angle there,
[4416.40 - 4419.40] P:1875.04 E:0.079881 |  he's in a better shooting position and he's more Salah.
[4419.40 - 4423.40] P:1838.30 E:0.085288 |  He's a big difference there, give it to more Salah in that position there,
[4423.40 - 4427.40] P:1845.27 E:0.101114 |  you're talking an almost certain goal so let's be fair to him,
[4427.40 - 4429.40] P:1960.89 E:0.092391 |  I think that's a Macalester mistake.
[4431.40 - 4436.40] P:1918.89 E:0.101931 |  A fellow Scott in Andy Robertson, we actually discussed this at half time,
[4436.40 - 4440.40] P:1873.66 E:0.088617 |  the luxury of the position that Liverpool find themselves in,
[4440.40 - 4444.40] P:2005.67 E:0.089971 |  every supporter inside Anfield will just be able to soak up this
[4444.40 - 4448.40] P:1972.56 E:0.084515 |  and enjoy the experience as we wait for the corner to come in from the left,
[4448.40 - 4450.40] P:1928.82 E:0.079985 |  and it comes now from Macalester and Bacario, claims it.
[4450.40 - 4452.40] P:1781.32 E:0.095889 |  Every single player will get his chance,
[4452.40 - 4457.40] P:1767.60 E:0.080693 |  but every single song that they can think of will get this opportunity as well,
[4457.40 - 4461.40] P:1869.43 E:0.091988 |  so I think it will be enjoyed and it gets towards the end of the game
[4461.40 - 4464.40] P:1894.53 E:0.077899 |  if Liverpool can stay at least two goals clear,
[4464.40 - 4467.40] P:1805.62 E:0.081329 |  the Crescendo will just build and build and build until the end.
[4467.40 - 4471.40] P:1874.65 E:0.107833 |  Bacario, almost caught in possession inside his six yard area.
[4473.40 - 4476.40] P:1793.33 E:0.109929 |  As the ball goes up towards Solanke, comes straight back though,
[4476.40 - 4479.40] P:1867.26 E:0.097093 |  Gravenburg looks for a free kick, Bergvall, as he fouls,
[4479.40 - 4483.40] P:1753.29 E:0.109026 |  the referee will say yes, it'll be a Tottenham Hotspur free kick,
[4483.40 - 4486.40] P:1831.50 E:0.105549 |  deep inside their own half, ten minutes into the second half.
[4487.40 - 4491.40] P:1816.45 E:0.094469 |  Manchester City, a leading Nottingham Forest 2-0 on Sports Extra,
[4491.40 - 4493.40] P:1777.12 E:0.087180 |  earlier Bournemouth won Manchester United won,
[4493.40 - 4495.40] P:1727.11 E:0.094747 |  it's how it finished in the Premier League,
[4495.40 - 4499.40] P:1827.97 E:0.097735 |  in the Women's Champions League semi-final, second leg Arsenal lead Lyon by a goal to nil,
[4499.40 - 4503.40] P:1872.77 E:0.104576 |  Spurs have given the ball away cheaply, here is Salah to Suboslai,
[4503.40 - 4507.40] P:1870.36 E:0.099027 |  and then running back with Zudoggi just to break it up inside the penalty area,
[4507.40 - 4509.40] P:1818.84 E:0.071863 |  and then they'll get...
[4509.40 - 4513.40] P:1872.73 E:0.098298 |  No, kept him played by DS on the far side, didn't go out of play.
[4514.40 - 4516.40] P:1940.82 E:0.095462 |  Spurs need to be better in possession than that.
[4516.40 - 4519.40] P:1601.65 E:0.099124 |  It's getting very angible at the moment, they're still really open,
[4519.40 - 4522.40] P:1543.66 E:0.094551 |  when they get the ball they're trying to play it out from the back,
[4522.40 - 4525.40] P:1754.21 E:0.080340 |  the problem is, the vicious in the midfield,
[4525.40 - 4528.40] P:1542.76 E:0.102845 |  they're winning it back constantly Liverpool,
[4528.40 - 4532.40] P:1636.86 E:0.090147 |  they're just that little bit sharper, better, quicker, better tacklers,
[4532.40 - 4536.40] P:1630.59 E:0.093829 |  reading the game too well, it's a nightmare to play against just now for Spurs.
[4536.40 - 4541.40] P:1801.21 E:0.099245 |  Well they've never looked like relinquishing the healthy lead that they've had for so many weeks now,
[4541.40 - 4546.40] P:1723.76 E:0.092335 |  remember they went top of the Premier League on November the 2nd,
[4546.40 - 4550.40] P:1862.17 E:0.095077 |  so what's that, 177 days since,
[4551.40 - 4555.40] P:1954.59 E:0.098207 |  they are not going to relinquish a two-goal lead here against Spurs,
[4555.40 - 4557.40] P:1870.54 E:0.089780 |  they'd be very surprised if they did.
[4557.40 - 4560.40] P:1758.16 E:0.087891 |  I mean football's wild, strange things have happened,
[4560.40 - 4563.40] P:1633.95 E:0.083321 |  they've seen it, you know, if Spurs could get a goal,
[4563.40 - 4565.40] P:1540.20 E:0.103166 |  they need to go over the half-way line to get a goal,
[4565.40 - 4569.40] P:1731.81 E:0.083792 |  at least I've not done very much of a toe in this second half so far,
[4569.40 - 4572.40] P:1924.31 E:0.100267 |  but it's so hard to see anyway,
[4572.40 - 4576.40] P:1730.07 E:0.086117 |  and that's going to happen by how well Liverpool are playing at the moment.
[4576.40 - 4580.40] P:1824.99 E:0.091274 |  Virgil van Dijk, who's played the most minutes in the Premier League,
[4580.40 - 4583.40] P:1672.10 E:0.096140 |  any other Liverpool player, 2,970,
[4583.40 - 4587.40] P:1654.89 E:0.093377 |  Alisson, who had that spell on the sidelines through injury,
[4587.40 - 4589.40] P:1675.63 E:0.098381 |  in the first half of the season,
[4589.40 - 4593.40] P:1711.51 E:0.098507 |  Robertson goes downfield, cut out there off the chest by Spence,
[4593.40 - 4596.40] P:1645.04 E:0.102191 |  a rare foray into the Liverpool half for Tottenham,
[4596.40 - 4600.40] P:1739.20 E:0.085343 |  but then coming back is Gravenberg,
[4600.40 - 4603.40] P:1787.00 E:0.095842 |  no, it was on that far side-gack, here is Gravenberg,
[4603.40 - 4605.40] P:1909.18 E:0.099714 |  now his ball towards the boss-lie,
[4605.40 - 4607.40] P:1868.07 E:0.101553 |  and the boss-lie's got room to run into,
[4607.40 - 4609.40] P:1757.05 E:0.102945 |  and he feeds the ball to the feet of Salah,
[4609.40 - 4612.40] P:1828.34 E:0.095978 |  and Salah runs into the penalty area, cuts into his left foot,
[4612.40 - 4615.40] P:1962.80 E:0.104895 |  and Salah, shot, takes the reflection, corner kick,
[4615.40 - 4617.40] P:1970.43 E:0.100151 |  free on Liverpool, corner on the right-hand side.
[4617.40 - 4621.40] P:1917.49 E:0.106928 |  You almost don't have to commentate in Salah when it goes down the right wing there, do you?
[4621.40 - 4624.40] P:1779.29 E:0.101003 |  He cuts into the right-hand side, he's across that 18-yard line,
[4624.40 - 4627.40] P:1705.16 E:0.095962 |  you know, he's trying to get half a yard for the ball.
[4627.40 - 4631.40] P:1840.34 E:0.090228 |  Just before that, the ball was one deep in midfield,
[4631.40 - 4635.40] P:1907.73 E:0.096699 |  and it's Gravenberg, and he threw a dummy in the midfield there,
[4635.40 - 4638.40] P:1976.12 E:0.105161 |  it was almost missed, the two players went flying,
[4638.40 - 4641.40] P:1888.87 E:0.104638 |  and it was just a little sneak-hit moment there,
[4641.40 - 4644.40] P:1763.74 E:0.096954 |  and it opened up the entirety of the play.
[4644.40 - 4646.40] P:1608.68 E:0.114179 |  It's easier doing a three-way knock,
[4646.40 - 4649.40] P:1715.81 E:0.106723 |  a lot easier to do, but it was a classy break.
[4651.40 - 4653.40] P:1858.62 E:0.126670 |  Andy Robinson takes two large strides back
[4653.40 - 4656.40] P:1888.04 E:0.098872 |  to deliver the corner kick on this near side, the right.
[4656.40 - 4658.40] P:1930.63 E:0.091416 |  Liverpool lead by three goals to one,
[4658.40 - 4661.40] P:1793.67 E:0.106916 |  left-footed by Robinson, canates up, Van Dyke tries to get on the end of it,
[4661.40 - 4664.40] P:1867.31 E:0.093981 |  McAllister has a volley, peels for handball,
[4664.40 - 4666.40] P:1997.69 E:0.100114 |  comes to the right-hand side of the area, falls to Salah,
[4666.40 - 4669.40] P:1915.72 E:0.104608 |  he tees up Alexander Arnall, Alexander Arnall, shaped to shoot,
[4669.40 - 4672.40] P:1842.54 E:0.116803 |  more humble penalties, Salah goes to ground,
[4672.40 - 4674.40] P:1921.61 E:0.105498 |  Ball scrambled away by Davis.
[4674.40 - 4677.40] P:2022.03 E:0.103779 |  There must have been about three penalty shots there for Liverpool,
[4677.40 - 4681.40] P:1973.31 E:0.106086 |  and at the end of that, the referee gives the free kick to Spurs for foul on tell.
[4681.40 - 4684.40] P:1874.97 E:0.098294 |  Well, they have a look at each other, the referee's telling everyone to calm down.
[4684.40 - 4686.40] P:1805.92 E:0.095640 |  Now, the first one would have been about harsh,
[4686.40 - 4691.40] P:1870.18 E:0.089403 |  smashed into the Tottenham defender there from no distance at all,
[4691.40 - 4693.40] P:1941.11 E:0.062543 |  and his arms were in, that's not a penalty kick.
[4693.40 - 4695.40] P:1876.87 E:0.075073 |  The Salah one, once again,
[4695.40 - 4698.40] P:1894.35 E:0.073341 |  I think that would be a bit soft in front of the cop.
[4698.40 - 4700.40] P:1844.00 E:0.076950 |  I'd be surprised if any of these are given,
[4700.40 - 4702.40] P:1823.65 E:0.100742 |  let's have another look at it, we are seeing...
[4702.40 - 4704.40] P:2014.06 E:0.086236 |  It was McAllister wasn't it, struck the chest of Dancer.
[4704.40 - 4707.40] P:1616.13 E:0.094711 |  Yeah, maybe even the shoulder, but his arms are down by his side,
[4707.40 - 4709.40] P:1876.33 E:0.075794 |  so not a problem at all.
[4709.40 - 4711.40] P:1829.24 E:0.093140 |  And the other one for the free kick,
[4711.40 - 4714.40] P:1798.01 E:0.093809 |  which I'm absolutely convinced wasn't the one as well,
[4714.40 - 4716.40] P:1974.58 E:0.072613 |  but the referee made no attempt to tackle.
[4716.40 - 4719.40] P:1905.82 E:0.102570 |  There's been another goal in Lyon in that women's Champions League semi-final.
[4719.40 - 4721.40] P:1703.78 E:0.090057 |  Victoria Polley.
[4721.40 - 4725.40] P:1916.87 E:0.108745 |  Is Lyon Niel Arsenal 2 in injury time at the end of the first half?
[4725.40 - 4729.40] P:1639.51 E:0.097928 |  Arsenal scoring a beautiful curling effort from the edge of the area
[4729.40 - 4731.40] P:1752.19 E:0.095607 |  from Mariona Caldente,
[4731.40 - 4734.40] P:1864.75 E:0.099991 |  means that they go ahead in this Champions League semi-final.
[4734.40 - 4737.40] P:1659.82 E:0.077485 |  Is Lyon Niel Arsenal 2 3-2 on aggregate?
[4737.40 - 4741.40] P:1771.28 E:0.091650 |  3-2 on aggregate, with the right to meet Barcelona in the final.
[4742.40 - 4745.40] P:1818.56 E:0.085405 |  Arsenal's men will be hoping for success
[4745.40 - 4748.40] P:1853.00 E:0.070120 |  against French opposition in midweek.
[4748.40 - 4750.40] P:1758.88 E:0.091391 |  Commentary on Tuesday night from the Emirates,
[4750.40 - 4752.40] P:1850.51 E:0.089300 |  Arsenal against Paris Saint-Germain.
[4755.40 - 4757.40] P:1888.20 E:0.104894 |  Dancer steps forward, Dancer shoots,
[4757.40 - 4760.40] P:1906.37 E:0.083404 |  and right-footed.
[4760.40 - 4762.40] P:1950.52 E:0.077503 |  What was he, less than 25 yards out,
[4762.40 - 4765.40] P:1971.18 E:0.092108 |  dragged it off target, goal kick, still 3-1 Liverpool.
[4765.40 - 4767.40] P:1915.14 E:0.087997 |  We've been playing for an hour.
[4767.40 - 4770.40] P:1874.81 E:0.097738 |  Yeah, and that's what sports have to do if they're going to get back into this game.
[4770.40 - 4773.40] P:1841.99 E:0.100628 |  The problem is, when you play in the Rangers style,
[4773.40 - 4776.40] P:1869.43 E:0.092964 |  you want your full back to fly forward to doggie and spence.
[4776.40 - 4779.40] P:1823.40 E:0.111671 |  Now and again, fly forward, create some problems there.
[4779.40 - 4782.40] P:1952.63 E:0.096352 |  They've had the over the half, half-way line, have they?
[4782.40 - 4784.40] P:1921.39 E:0.093169 |  They've not got any good positions.
[4784.40 - 4786.40] P:1830.95 E:0.095998 |  That's because they're playing against good players,
[4786.40 - 4788.40] P:1765.75 E:0.090015 |  and they've just not got good position to be able to do that.
[4788.40 - 4791.40] P:1776.92 E:0.089076 |  It's very, very hard to create that.
[4791.40 - 4793.40] P:1803.98 E:0.102968 |  Oh, that was a mistake by Arsenal.
[4793.40 - 4797.40] P:1929.50 E:0.112359 |  The Cario under pressure from Diaz almost let in the Colombian,
[4797.40 - 4800.40] P:1910.81 E:0.104187 |  and then hurriedly he had to clear it out of play for a throw,
[4800.40 - 4803.40] P:1957.82 E:0.091920 |  but they've taken the throw whilst there are two balls on the pitch.
[4803.40 - 4806.40] P:1875.44 E:0.089073 |  I think the initial one from the Cario bounce back off the advertising hoardings,
[4806.40 - 4809.40] P:1993.44 E:0.086863 |  and therefore there's a stoppage, and that throw will have to be retaken.
[4809.40 - 4811.40] P:1678.40 E:0.055153 |  I'm ashamed of that.
[4811.40 - 4813.40] P:1607.61 E:0.111286 |  That's exactly the right thing to do in that situation.
[4813.40 - 4815.40] P:1757.31 E:0.091837 |  Take it very, very quickly.
[4815.40 - 4817.40] P:1831.82 E:0.081599 |  Spells weren't quite ready yet.
[4817.40 - 4821.40] P:1739.28 E:0.083943 |  They've got themselves set again, but once again, good control that far.
[4821.40 - 4824.40] P:1556.81 E:0.069280 |  My field from Van Dijk,
[4824.40 - 4826.40] P:1604.16 E:0.076268 |  just watching Van Dijk, just now,
[4826.40 - 4828.40] P:1479.37 E:0.084717 |  I haven't mentioned he didn't watch.
[4828.40 - 4830.40] P:1644.21 E:0.088123 |  Do you think he's broken his weight yet?
[4830.40 - 4832.40] P:1755.13 E:0.068951 |  He does it.
[4832.40 - 4838.40] P:1688.02 E:0.085564 |  Van Dijk, I think it says a great deal that he and Mo Salah have signed contracts,
[4838.40 - 4843.40] P:1793.19 E:0.098954 |  to sign that they believe that Liverpool will be able to challenge
[4843.40 - 4845.40] P:1814.07 E:0.114686 |  under Arnav Slopp for a season to come.
[4845.40 - 4848.40] P:1756.12 E:0.105614 |  Salah passes the ball, but Danzo clears the ball away.
[4848.40 - 4851.40] P:1900.62 E:0.093057 |  They're going to be the seventh team in Premier League history
[4851.40 - 4854.40] P:1760.02 E:0.095567 |  to secure the title with four or more games remaining,
[4854.40 - 4856.40] P:1739.82 E:0.105611 |  and they are not letting up.
[4856.40 - 4858.40] P:1593.73 E:0.084891 |  They're still coming forward.
[4858.40 - 4860.40] P:1678.53 E:0.073300 |  Gatpo over on that left-hand side,
[4860.40 - 4863.40] P:1856.67 E:0.107433 |  and this is going to be Gravenberg who's going to shoot,
[4863.40 - 4866.40] P:1850.08 E:0.112226 |  and the Cario makes the save low to his right.
[4866.40 - 4868.40] P:1966.86 E:0.115796 |  That might have been an awkward one.
[4868.40 - 4870.40] P:1980.14 E:0.105352 |  It might have taken a deflection on its way through.
[4870.40 - 4872.40] P:1822.38 E:0.090527 |  He saved it the second attempt.
[4872.40 - 4875.40] P:1854.15 E:0.086667 |  Yeah, I mean, a decent shot. It's from real depth distancing,
[4875.40 - 4878.40] P:1682.11 E:0.084833 |  but it shows you the hunger for all those Liverpool players.
[4878.40 - 4880.40] P:1741.01 E:0.084216 |  They're patting it out, only went to yard.
[4880.40 - 4883.40] P:1794.33 E:0.085353 |  Three nearest players to them, all wearing red.
[4883.40 - 4887.40] P:1671.41 E:0.079460 |  Chasing it in Diaz, chasing it in Salah, chasing it in Gatpo,
[4887.40 - 4890.40] P:1704.29 E:0.085637 |  chasing it, anything that's going to come off.
[4890.40 - 4892.40] P:1766.87 E:0.092201 |  These are not players that are cruising along here.
[4892.40 - 4895.40] P:1685.96 E:0.076175 |  These are players that want to absolutely put this to bed,
[4895.40 - 4897.40] P:1680.39 E:0.065350 |  and it's also quite like a goal.
[4898.40 - 4901.40] P:1949.43 E:0.105990 |  Alexander Reinal tried the back heel towards Salah,
[4901.40 - 4902.40] P:1932.50 E:0.091052 |  stopped by Odogi.
[4902.40 - 4906.40] P:1928.73 E:0.085028 |  The quirk about Liverpool's last title success five years ago,
[4906.40 - 4909.40] P:1849.98 E:0.080208 |  when Manchester City lost to Chelsea, it was the 25th of June,
[4909.40 - 4912.40] P:1814.72 E:0.090639 |  Liverpool won the title the earliest with seven games left,
[4912.40 - 4915.40] P:1723.17 E:0.086672 |  but it was also later than any other team in terms of the date
[4915.40 - 4918.40] P:1771.69 E:0.080844 |  because of Covid it was pushed back to the summer.
[4918.40 - 4921.40] P:1772.77 E:0.092042 |  Talking of Manchester City, let's get an update from Wembley.
[4921.40 - 4922.40] P:1790.27 E:0.074441 |  John Southall.
[4922.40 - 4924.40] P:1691.05 E:0.120655 |  Odogi, nodding a forest by two goals to Nill.
[4924.40 - 4926.40] P:1600.61 E:0.104628 |  It's all city at the moment, could have been three.
[4926.40 - 4929.40] P:1573.87 E:0.106580 |  Savino on the left of the area, pushed over the crossbar by Salah.
[4929.40 - 4931.40] P:1766.91 E:0.092412 |  They have a corner here now, as we said before,
[4931.40 - 4933.40] P:1545.06 E:0.110988 |  looks a long way back for Forest.
[4933.40 - 4934.40] P:1868.24 E:0.104804 |  Will they make changes?
[4934.40 - 4936.40] P:1793.96 E:0.103381 |  Surely they'll have to, for a still man city two.
[4936.40 - 4939.40] P:1916.25 E:0.088054 |  Coventry on sports section, Kuleseski forward for Spurs.
[4939.40 - 4942.40] P:1966.29 E:0.096372 |  Just as he tried to shoot, just taken away from him,
[4942.40 - 4944.40] P:1841.26 E:0.107230 |  and McCallison out to Savoslai.
[4944.40 - 4946.40] P:1796.55 E:0.092389 |  And there's a break on for Liverpool.
[4946.40 - 4949.40] P:1885.06 E:0.104823 |  Savoslai has got Dias to his left, he's got Salah to his right.
[4949.40 - 4952.40] P:1983.65 E:0.094321 |  He goes with the Egyptian, Salah onto his left boot.
[4952.40 - 4953.40] P:1975.89 E:0.103100 |  Salah shoots!
[4953.40 - 4954.40] P:1941.23 E:0.121182 |  Salah scores!
[4956.40 - 4959.40] P:1906.40 E:0.117638 |  The Egyptian King with the crown in moments,
[4959.40 - 4962.40] P:1894.59 E:0.117580 |  for the huge champion of England,
[4962.40 - 4966.40] P:1983.70 E:0.111930 |  and that is the 200th goal for Mo Salah,
[4966.40 - 4968.40] P:1963.98 E:0.104419 |  off that trusty left foot.
[4968.40 - 4971.40] P:1977.16 E:0.113049 |  He ends his goal drought, and Liverpool now leads Spurs,
[4971.40 - 4973.40] P:2019.34 E:0.111676 |  by four goals to one.
[4975.40 - 4978.40] P:1758.44 E:0.111173 |  Well said before, and the only surprising thing is
[4978.40 - 4980.40] P:1772.98 E:0.113192 |  that Mo Salah hasn't scored a goal yet.
[4980.40 - 4983.40] P:1833.54 E:0.109502 |  And if you could draw a picture of Mo Salah's goals,
[4983.40 - 4985.40] P:1837.35 E:0.107441 |  you'd draw that one, wouldn't you?
[4985.40 - 4987.40] P:1876.12 E:0.105425 |  He just gets it balling right on the side,
[4987.40 - 4989.40] P:1811.99 E:0.105065 |  he cuts across the 18-yard line,
[4989.40 - 4991.40] P:1805.46 E:0.103287 |  and he can put a back post on here, post.
[4991.40 - 4993.40] P:1786.48 E:0.111196 |  It doesn't really mark him.
[4993.40 - 4996.40] P:1783.46 E:0.118225 |  An indication near post, and he's going down
[4996.40 - 4998.40] P:1818.61 E:0.102579 |  and done a little selfie.
[4998.40 - 5001.40] P:1880.03 E:0.102491 |  Right in front of the cop, brilliant.
[5001.40 - 5007.40] P:1943.33 E:0.110127 |  Well, he's just made one supporter's dream come true.
[5007.40 - 5009.40] P:1969.31 E:0.109026 |  He's taken a mobile phone,
[5009.40 - 5012.40] P:1969.59 E:0.106404 |  taken a selfie in front of the cop.
[5012.40 - 5014.40] P:1969.50 E:0.109066 |  He now takes the acclaim,
[5016.40 - 5020.40] P:1933.09 E:0.118227 |  and Liverpool are coasting to this record.
[5020.40 - 5024.40] P:1905.26 E:0.113027 |  He's scored, equaling 20th top-by-tival.
[5026.40 - 5028.40] P:1787.38 E:0.113183 |  I mean, looking here, them saying it in the right,
[5028.40 - 5031.40] P:1861.55 E:0.118625 |  there's not any doubt now they're going to win the league.
[5031.40 - 5033.40] P:1654.52 E:0.113916 |  I mean, technically, what happened in that goal,
[5033.40 - 5035.40] P:1808.55 E:0.110468 |  if it's of any interest at all.
[5035.40 - 5037.40] P:1785.99 E:0.109712 |  Spence finally went forward on the right-hand side,
[5037.40 - 5039.40] P:1873.81 E:0.101794 |  because Kulesess could drag them forward.
[5039.40 - 5043.40] P:1753.24 E:0.114288 |  And by doing that, he's taking any control
[5043.40 - 5045.40] P:1842.30 E:0.091537 |  that they have about the defensive situation.
[5045.40 - 5047.40] P:1681.94 E:0.100467 |  When there's a weakness at all,
[5047.40 - 5049.40] P:1801.63 E:0.083695 |  Liverpool make good use of it.
[5049.40 - 5051.40] P:1770.17 E:0.091013 |  Kulesess, get the other end, meanwhile.
[5051.40 - 5053.40] P:1767.03 E:0.101516 |  Liverpool lead by four goals to one.
[5053.40 - 5057.40] P:1836.17 E:0.099469 |  64 minutes played, BBC Radio 5 Live in the World Service.

[5059.40 - 5062.40] P:1921.29 E:0.112648 |  Sar shoots, Allyson makes a save.
[5064.40 - 5066.40] P:1839.15 E:0.104210 |  Back to Wembley, John Southall.
[5066.40 - 5068.40] P:1604.00 E:0.112738 |  It's still Forrest Nell Manchester City, too,
[5068.40 - 5070.40] P:1471.61 E:0.106835 |  but what a goal this would have been.
[5070.40 - 5072.40] P:1790.47 E:0.101067 |  Morgan gives right on the right of the area,
[5072.40 - 5074.40] P:1669.47 E:0.112700 |  14 yards out on his left foot on the volley,
[5075.40 - 5078.40] P:1645.12 E:0.107460 |  crashed against the bar for us, Nell Manchester City, too.
[5078.40 - 5080.40] P:1885.97 E:0.105101 |  commentary on sports excerpt.
[5080.40 - 5082.40] P:1682.88 E:0.103897 |  Otterberg's going to be coming on for Tal.
[5082.40 - 5085.40] P:1754.99 E:0.108739 |  Richardlasen is also going to be coming on.
[5087.40 - 5090.40] P:1745.21 E:0.112402 |  I think it was written in the stars that Mo Salah,
[5090.40 - 5093.40] P:1732.54 E:0.110764 |  with his 12th week goal against Tottenham Hotspur,
[5093.40 - 5097.40] P:1720.55 E:0.096160 |  would end his goal drought here today.
[5097.40 - 5099.40] P:1618.83 E:0.103312 |  One goal and nine.
[5101.40 - 5103.40] P:1783.67 E:0.118908 |  Wilson Otterberg.
[5103.40 - 5105.40] P:1683.49 E:0.106216 |  And Richardlasen waiting to come on.
[5105.40 - 5109.40] P:1688.96 E:0.104726 |  Salah and Tel will be the two players that will make way.
[5111.40 - 5114.40] P:1772.54 E:0.113564 |  It's just a shame they're supposed to break a little.
[5114.40 - 5116.40] P:1772.51 E:0.101778 |  They have a half a chance there,
[5116.40 - 5118.40] P:1615.17 E:0.108754 |  but there's not enough understanding between the players
[5118.40 - 5120.40] P:1728.99 E:0.093836 |  and Tel in that time.
[5120.40 - 5122.40] P:1598.34 E:0.100641 |  Just stop the run. You can't stop your run there.
[5122.40 - 5124.40] P:1449.24 E:0.103934 |  The ball's in the middle, Sar's on the ball.
[5124.40 - 5126.40] P:1657.21 E:0.097256 |  Keep on making the run.
[5126.40 - 5128.40] P:1530.45 E:0.101853 |  If it doesn't get delivered, it's not your problem.
[5128.40 - 5130.40] P:1599.92 E:0.095237 |  It's the deliverer's problem,
[5130.40 - 5132.40] P:1612.64 E:0.080358 |  but just not being enough understanding
[5132.40 - 5135.40] P:1667.91 E:0.083801 |  with those first players so far in this game.
[5137.40 - 5141.40] P:1712.61 E:0.111130 |  Well, for Tottenham Hotspur, they've got to try and turn their attentions.
[5141.40 - 5143.40] P:1696.07 E:0.107893 |  They'll have to dust themselves off.
[5143.40 - 5145.40] P:1621.59 E:0.096493 |  They did make the eight changes.
[5145.40 - 5148.40] P:1570.01 E:0.107663 |  Going into that game against Polo Glint.
[5148.40 - 5151.40] P:1762.49 E:0.117201 |  You'd have to feel as well all the ball giving away.
[5151.40 - 5153.40] P:1781.91 E:0.101682 |  Gatpo's nipped in.
[5153.40 - 5155.40] P:1856.94 E:0.110318 |  Gatpo, Mike Bortow, Salah takes over.
[5155.40 - 5157.40] P:1766.01 E:0.117379 |  Feeding towards the boss live.
[5157.40 - 5159.40] P:1875.17 E:0.100216 |  Beaten out by the Cario.
[5161.40 - 5163.40] P:2029.93 E:0.105174 |  Spurs are going to be so careful.
[5163.40 - 5166.40] P:1957.76 E:0.095983 |  They do not want to be going into that game
[5166.40 - 5168.40] P:1880.94 E:0.108755 |  on the back of the hiding.
[5168.40 - 5170.40] P:1813.86 E:0.101829 |  Yeah, and they can smell it, they can.
[5170.40 - 5172.40] P:1799.24 E:0.082481 |  They absolutely can smell it.
[5172.40 - 5174.40] P:1673.17 E:0.105210 |  They're falling apart a little bit of the back.
[5174.40 - 5176.40] P:1601.08 E:0.099875 |  They can cut out, they can cut the ball in the midfield.
[5176.40 - 5178.40] P:1798.92 E:0.093599 |  Just know it's four.
[5178.40 - 5180.40] P:1724.01 E:0.112051 |  They need to calm it down a little bit.
[5180.40 - 5182.40] P:1812.53 E:0.108388 |  Hold the ball if they can.
[5182.40 - 5185.40] P:1716.25 E:0.107398 |  They've just not been able to do that at any point in the same time.
[5185.40 - 5189.40] P:1754.36 E:0.098745 |  Salah trying to dance his way through to the penalty area.
[5189.40 - 5193.40] P:1878.03 E:0.087593 |  There's a real strong smell of sulphur in our commentary position
[5193.40 - 5196.40] P:1930.36 E:0.089164 |  on this day of celebration for Liverpool.
[5196.40 - 5198.40] P:1783.89 E:0.070047 |  Four-one they lead.
[5200.40 - 5202.40] P:1696.74 E:0.082308 |  Van Dijk urged to shoot.
[5202.40 - 5204.40] P:1805.51 E:0.108171 |  And Bytes fires it wide.
[5204.40 - 5207.40] P:1804.82 E:0.111633 |  Good 30 yards out, right footed up target goal.
[5207.40 - 5209.40] P:1993.00 E:0.102055 |  Kick Liverpool, four-one.
[5209.40 - 5214.40] P:1806.60 E:0.102507 |  Yeah, Van Dijk's shooting from there is actually ugly, unusual.
[5214.40 - 5217.40] P:1759.88 E:0.111045 |  You should do it more, because in his earlier career
[5217.40 - 5220.40] P:1769.47 E:0.104186 |  he scored some brilliant goals from there.
[5220.40 - 5225.40] P:1895.99 E:0.103214 |  But the boo here actually is slanking his off and Rich Alisson comes on.
[5225.40 - 5227.40] P:1798.35 E:0.112181 |  I think it may be Rich Alisson coming on.
[5227.40 - 5230.40] P:1808.97 E:0.108458 |  Coming on is a problem as opposed to Salah and coming off.
[5232.40 - 5236.40] P:1993.56 E:0.118924 |  As a former Evertonian, he was never going to be awarded a warm welcome.
[5236.40 - 5238.40] P:1996.19 E:0.077739 |  What is that?
[5238.40 - 5243.40] P:1959.50 E:0.105845 |  His four goals, incidentally, against Liverpool have all come at Anfield.
[5244.40 - 5247.40] P:2039.47 E:0.105614 |  Liverpool are going to make changes as well.
[5247.40 - 5252.40] P:2053.72 E:0.104307 |  20 is the magic number as far as Liverpool are concerned today.
[5252.40 - 5256.40] P:2028.88 E:0.104479 |  And Jota, sporting the number 20, is one of the players coming on.
[5256.40 - 5258.40] P:2090.61 E:0.094564 |  So Boss Light comes off.
[5258.40 - 5262.40] P:2084.54 E:0.097582 |  Curtis Jones is another one who is going to be coming on.
[5262.40 - 5264.40] P:2118.63 E:0.107352 |  We'll wait to see who goes off.
[5264.40 - 5266.40] P:2089.28 E:0.088388 |  It is going to be Cody Gatpo.
[5267.40 - 5272.40] P:2067.69 E:0.103876 |  Cody Gatpo, who turns to take the poor dicks from the crowd.
[5272.40 - 5275.40] P:2020.30 E:0.107572 |  He's played with Alisson, a group reception he's got.
[5275.40 - 5278.40] P:2002.76 E:0.102478 |  Anyone who comes off just now will get a fabulous reception.
[5278.40 - 5282.40] P:2011.24 E:0.095624 |  And there's also a part of you that you want to be on at the end
[5282.40 - 5285.40] P:1942.18 E:0.101702 |  when it happens, when the whistle blows, when you become champions.
[5285.40 - 5289.40] P:1964.31 E:0.090605 |  But there's a lot of players in that squad that deserve to be on that field.
[5289.40 - 5293.40] P:1920.10 E:0.089020 |  Just now, incidentally, I don't think you could argue against Jota being on there.
[5293.40 - 5295.40] P:1821.69 E:0.067398 |  And indeed, Alit.
[5296.40 - 5301.40] P:1897.72 E:0.092754 |  Well, there are 40 medals that are handed out by the Premier League.
[5301.40 - 5306.40] P:1868.86 E:0.097986 |  Currently, Liverpool have had 21 players who have played at least five appearances
[5306.40 - 5309.40] P:1816.56 E:0.102876 |  in the Premier League to qualify to be guaranteed a medal.
[5309.40 - 5313.40] P:1817.17 E:0.099744 |  Keazer has only played four times in the Premier League.
[5313.40 - 5318.40] P:1904.97 E:0.087417 |  I wonder if we might see a sentimental touch from Arna Slott for Keazer to come on,
[5318.40 - 5320.40] P:1951.36 E:0.089894 |  to be guaranteed a medal.
[5320.40 - 5324.40] P:1902.21 E:0.086559 |  The thing is, it is the club's discretion to hand out those other medals.
[5324.40 - 5326.40] P:1969.12 E:0.091652 |  So I'm sure he'll get one anyway.
[5326.40 - 5330.40] P:1964.36 E:0.095981 |  Alexander-Arnold, forced towards Jota, breaks back towards Alexander-Arnold.
[5330.40 - 5334.40] P:1978.66 E:0.113827 |  Ponte Goldin! And on the goal line, it's Mo Salah.
[5338.40 - 5344.40] P:1954.51 E:0.114659 |  Liverpool are wrapping up a record, Eakling, 20th title in style.
[5344.40 - 5348.40] P:1962.47 E:0.103930 |  They now lead Spurs by five goals to one.
[5348.40 - 5351.40] P:1931.87 E:0.103002 |  Well, they're just sitting there hoping that it's offside.
[5351.40 - 5353.40] P:1888.89 E:0.097237 |  There's a possibility it might be.
[5353.40 - 5356.40] P:1958.56 E:0.095682 |  It's almost apologetic, they've been Mo Salah.
[5356.40 - 5358.40] P:1940.39 E:0.092351 |  He's got a big grin in his face just now.
[5358.40 - 5360.40] P:1853.71 E:0.106748 |  It was so easy for him.
[5360.40 - 5363.40] P:1962.71 E:0.098059 |  I said a few moments ago at the fourth one, you asked a half-time,
[5363.40 - 5365.40] P:1948.83 E:0.100182 |  you didn't want it to fall apart.
[5365.40 - 5370.40] P:1816.12 E:0.110714 |  It looks really messy, really, really messy at this period of the game.
[5370.40 - 5373.40] P:1764.57 E:0.112837 |  And he's seen me go through, there's an ugly line at the back there,
[5373.40 - 5375.40] P:1848.06 E:0.110532 |  it doesn't look good.
[5375.40 - 5379.40] P:1776.26 E:0.108544 |  And I'm looking at that there, it's very, very tight for offside, very tight.
[5379.40 - 5382.40] P:1851.73 E:0.102514 |  I couldn't tell you from the angle that we have seen it at.
[5383.40 - 5386.40] P:1796.99 E:0.105315 |  I've just seen another angle, I still can't tell you.
[5386.40 - 5390.40] P:1952.81 E:0.101522 |  It might be the right leg of Danso that he's just playing Mo Salah on.
[5391.40 - 5395.40] P:1839.88 E:0.096276 |  And in fact, before he got there, it came up Udagi.
[5395.40 - 5398.40] P:1903.19 E:0.101209 |  Fireworks are being let off in the distance.
[5400.40 - 5404.40] P:1968.66 E:0.092828 |  You've got to check that though, you've got to check that one, it's so, so tight.
[5404.40 - 5407.40] P:1902.60 E:0.074769 |  And if Salah didn't get a touch on it, you know,
[5407.40 - 5409.40] P:1875.32 E:0.099352 |  do you still see it's offside?
[5409.40 - 5411.40] P:1790.67 E:0.098945 |  It's the only reason why he defended it that way,
[5411.40 - 5414.40] P:1895.39 E:0.070757 |  it's because Salah would have tapped it and had he not done so.
[5414.40 - 5418.40] P:1947.50 E:0.091047 |  Udagi credited with the own goal if the goal stands at 5-1.
[5418.40 - 5421.40] P:1933.86 E:0.091673 |  I honestly don't think the Liverpool supporters will care,
[5421.40 - 5426.40] P:1927.98 E:0.093888 |  such as being the carefree celebrations that they've been able to enjoy
[5426.40 - 5429.40] P:1939.55 E:0.092241 |  with the nature of the way that this game has gone.
[5430.40 - 5432.40] P:1984.98 E:0.115626 |  But the goal does stand.
[5432.40 - 5434.40] P:1985.77 E:0.111764 |  And Liverpool do leave 5-1.
[5434.40 - 5437.40] P:1888.15 E:0.095921 |  I have to say, I don't think Salah thought it was going to count.
[5437.40 - 5439.40] P:1932.11 E:0.103452 |  And he was the nearest person to that.
[5439.40 - 5441.40] P:1788.31 E:0.103880 |  And a number of others didn't think so.
[5441.40 - 5443.40] P:1659.90 E:0.099478 |  It was very, very tight, it's 5-1.
[5444.40 - 5447.40] P:1852.55 E:0.078069 |  I'll tell you one thing, it hasn't been tight this game.
[5447.40 - 5449.40] P:1731.81 E:0.103722 |  They're absolutely curious.
[5449.40 - 5452.40] P:1605.21 E:0.090976 |  They play brilliantly, but in the second half,
[5452.40 - 5454.40] P:1576.90 E:0.107548 |  they've tried to hold together a squad,
[5454.40 - 5457.40] P:1735.04 E:0.104779 |  but this is no beginning to look quite ugly,
[5457.40 - 5459.40] P:1720.14 E:0.108317 |  particularly for the manager.
[5459.40 - 5463.40] P:1658.37 E:0.111123 |  Well, and Costa Codlou, you've got to say that,
[5463.40 - 5466.40] P:1703.46 E:0.106520 |  I know what could still happen in Europe,
[5466.40 - 5471.40] P:1817.58 E:0.099880 |  but he's had 47 points from his last 42 league games.
[5471.40 - 5476.40] P:1730.42 E:0.088931 |  You say that your league form is the true barometer.
[5477.40 - 5479.40] P:1852.78 E:0.097690 |  To credit, a lot of the Tottenham supporters,
[5479.40 - 5482.40] P:1894.76 E:0.099581 |  they have stayed in the away section away towards our left.
[5482.40 - 5484.40] P:1799.07 E:0.074176 |  As Otterberg comes forward,
[5484.40 - 5486.40] P:1833.44 E:0.100921 |  a rare chance for them to attack in this second half,
[5486.40 - 5489.40] P:1863.81 E:0.084903 |  with 18 minutes remaining.
[5491.40 - 5497.40] P:1931.55 E:0.101999 |  But when you consider that their record Premier League defeat
[5497.40 - 5503.40] P:1731.78 E:0.086504 |  was at Newcastle in 1996 by a scoreline of 7-1,
[5503.40 - 5506.40] P:1895.13 E:0.111590 |  this could get messy with still 18 minutes remaining.
[5506.40 - 5510.40] P:1684.16 E:0.107639 |  It could get messy, and it's partly what Liverpool want to do about it,
[5510.40 - 5514.40] P:1777.13 E:0.109973 |  but the Bryan players, the Bryan cutters joins just now.
[5514.40 - 5517.40] P:1734.28 E:0.117633 |  And Eastamon, he's just dribbling about and joining himself.
[5517.40 - 5520.40] P:1761.95 E:0.102060 |  The quality has not dropped.
[5521.40 - 5527.40] P:1621.70 E:0.103599 |  A deafening cry of champions inside Anfield.
[5529.40 - 5533.40] P:1614.13 E:0.094392 |  It'll be Liverpool's 70th major honour.
[5535.40 - 5541.40] P:1802.21 E:0.097308 |  20 titles, 29 cups, 21 supercups, England's most successful club.
[5541.40 - 5545.40] P:1740.56 E:0.094588 |  Manchester United, the closest to them was 68 after this title,
[5545.40 - 5547.40] P:1657.72 E:0.104043 |  here today for Liverpool.
[5548.40 - 5550.40] P:1538.91 E:0.077828 |  And they're lapping it up.
[5550.40 - 5553.40] P:1794.33 E:0.117100 |  The Spence shoots from a long way out,
[5553.40 - 5556.40] P:1930.57 E:0.103811 |  just 35 yards out, well off target, goal kick.
[5556.40 - 5558.40] P:1877.19 E:0.083383 |  Back to Wembley, John Southall.
[5558.40 - 5561.40] P:1633.77 E:0.116323 |  Forrest Neal, Manchester City 2 should be 2-1 now.
[5561.40 - 5564.40] P:1384.13 E:0.112642 |  Gvardiel gave the ball away, Morgan Gibbs white round the goalkeeper,
[5564.40 - 5567.40] P:1644.81 E:0.107375 |  tight angle, his shot came off the left hand post,
[5567.40 - 5570.40] P:1662.57 E:0.113540 |  and if Forrest lose this game, he will not forget that moment.
[5570.40 - 5574.40] P:1626.81 E:0.104501 |  What a chance it was, Forrest Neal, Manchester City 2.
[5574.40 - 5579.40] P:1710.40 E:0.101073 |  Liverpool top scorers in the Premier League, taking their tally to 80,
[5579.40 - 5585.40] P:1776.69 E:0.102277 |  and they've scored at least two goals in 29 of their 34 Premier League games,
[5585.40 - 5588.40] P:1806.92 E:0.109786 |  as they win the ball midway through their own half,
[5588.40 - 5591.40] P:1709.17 E:0.107905 |  and Jones now can run forward in the all red of Liverpool.
[5591.40 - 5593.40] P:1741.40 E:0.108435 |  And then was barred Stover,
[5593.40 - 5596.40] P:1833.94 E:0.104459 |  and the referee will give a free kick to the home side,
[5596.40 - 5598.40] P:1791.79 E:0.092475 |  just outside the centre-circle patnevin.
[5598.40 - 5601.40] P:1704.45 E:0.102280 |  Yeah, but this seems so lively, even at this part of the game,
[5601.40 - 5604.40] P:1643.05 E:0.105035 |  they're desperate when... It's best to try and go forward a little bit.
[5604.40 - 5608.40] P:1663.52 E:0.105770 |  They're living for that moment when they win the ball back again,
[5608.40 - 5610.40] P:1766.90 E:0.105170 |  and every red shot seems to fly forward,
[5610.40 - 5612.40] P:1744.21 E:0.098315 |  apart from Fintyte and Canati.
[5612.40 - 5614.40] P:1717.64 E:0.104531 |  Everyone wants to get in in the act today.
[5614.40 - 5618.40] P:1669.66 E:0.103607 |  I actually think every single one of those Liverpool players out there
[5618.40 - 5620.40] P:1691.31 E:0.092130 |  thinks they can score a goal today.
[5620.40 - 5623.40] P:1648.57 E:0.101543 |  They can tie the end of the season up for themselves with a goal,
[5623.40 - 5626.40] P:1562.06 E:0.097596 |  and enjoy these celebrations even more.
[5627.40 - 5630.40] P:1669.01 E:0.096574 |  Here is Canati, there's going to be two more players
[5630.40 - 5632.40] P:1714.15 E:0.087889 |  who are going to be coming on.
[5633.40 - 5640.40] P:1702.47 E:0.092064 |  It'll be Llewis Diaz and Trent Alexander-Arnold,
[5640.40 - 5643.40] P:1707.65 E:0.084213 |  who are the players who will make way
[5643.40 - 5646.40] P:1782.57 E:0.090557 |  with some 16 minutes remaining of normal time.
[5650.40 - 5653.40] P:1794.78 E:0.116168 |  It was Alexander-Arnold's goal, of course, at Leicester,
[5653.40 - 5656.40] P:1767.22 E:0.112798 |  that put Liverpool in a position to wrap it up here today.
[5657.40 - 5663.40] P:1779.73 E:0.106970 |  As again, Arna Slott's name chanted reciprocally by this Anfield crowd.
[5664.40 - 5667.40] P:1677.53 E:0.098437 |  Salah can't control that ball of around knee height,
[5667.40 - 5669.40] P:1840.78 E:0.099408 |  runs away from it, out for a goal kick.
[5669.40 - 5672.40] P:1782.92 E:0.106248 |  What a beautiful ball of Llewis by Trent Alexander-Arnold.
[5672.40 - 5676.40] P:1692.28 E:0.091157 |  And it is classy for a man because we know what he can do with his right foot.
[5676.40 - 5681.40] P:1660.90 E:0.097542 |  He just goes on his left and pings 140 yards at a weird angle
[5681.40 - 5683.40] P:1803.48 E:0.097575 |  and just puts it right on him,
[5683.40 - 5686.40] P:1648.72 E:0.114474 |  so it couldn't quite get a hold of it there.
[5686.40 - 5691.40] P:1828.38 E:0.108196 |  But it just shows you the quality that Trent Alexander-Arnold's got.
[5692.40 - 5695.40] P:1912.17 E:0.112995 |  If he does leave, he will be missed at this place.
[5695.40 - 5698.40] P:2023.26 E:0.103310 |  I'll tell you something else, he'll miss this place.
[5698.40 - 5700.40] P:2022.72 E:0.098634 |  He'll be missing him.
[5700.40 - 5704.40] P:2035.58 E:0.103876 |  You know, it's funny, Pat is six-leaf just to my right-hand side
[5704.40 - 5708.40] P:2013.64 E:0.105217 |  and yet when he talks, the noise being created by the Liverpool supporters,
[5708.40 - 5709.40] P:1948.46 E:0.102853 |  it's hard to hear him.
[5709.40 - 5712.40] P:2048.85 E:0.096801 |  Llewis Diassi is coming off to a standing ovation
[5712.40 - 5715.40] P:2013.65 E:0.092801 |  as Elliott and Mdow will come on.
[5717.40 - 5720.40] P:1932.44 E:0.119058 |  Diassi's been good again today, obviously scoring the first goal,
[5720.40 - 5722.40] P:1956.87 E:0.107879 |  calling back into it.
[5722.40 - 5726.40] P:1913.96 E:0.108070 |  Just watching down there, Trent Alexander-Arnold,
[5726.40 - 5731.40] P:1990.68 E:0.102092 |  getting everybody to applaud Lauda, I think he wants...
[5731.40 - 5734.40] P:1929.20 E:0.101818 |  He's trying to soak up every second of the season, isn't he?
[5734.40 - 5737.40] P:1917.12 E:0.095875 |  Which makes you wonder, it does make you wonder,
[5737.40 - 5740.40] P:1810.49 E:0.098735 |  but he's loving it, he's enjoying it, he's reacting with the fans,
[5740.40 - 5743.40] P:1797.98 E:0.086181 |  and he's showing the weather harms he cares about this club.
[5743.40 - 5745.40] P:1820.18 E:0.081853 |  Yes, very much so.
[5745.40 - 5748.40] P:1850.55 E:0.096534 |  And then with Carlo Ancelotti, he'll be...
[5748.40 - 5752.40] P:1799.09 E:0.083978 |  won't be the Real Madrid manager next season.
[5752.40 - 5755.40] P:1799.05 E:0.096983 |  There's so many red balloons now on the playing surface,
[5755.40 - 5758.40] P:1894.66 E:0.084345 |  there must be at least a dozen.
[5758.40 - 5762.40] P:1856.82 E:0.111429 |  All didn't seem well when I was in the Bernabau the other week with Arsenal.
[5763.40 - 5766.40] P:1841.59 E:0.110926 |  They're going to have to try and pop those balloons
[5766.40 - 5769.40] P:1781.22 E:0.099951 |  that are now blowing towards the centre-circle.
[5769.40 - 5773.40] P:1847.11 E:0.103416 |  Some of them are being waved away in the bottom tier,
[5773.40 - 5775.40] P:1748.75 E:0.102286 |  the seconded-out-league stand as well.
[5775.40 - 5779.40] P:1809.98 E:0.092536 |  14 minutes remaining, we're in full party mode now, Pat.
[5779.40 - 5782.40] P:1586.89 E:0.090528 |  Yep, balloons and everything, yes, we really loved that.
[5782.40 - 5785.40] P:1776.29 E:0.085296 |  And there's not really been a huge amount of attention for Liverpool.
[5785.40 - 5788.40] P:1744.22 E:0.088854 |  The only attention is how many goals is it going to be.
[5788.40 - 5791.40] P:1708.25 E:0.084192 |  And since that fourth goal, they're going to stop the game now,
[5791.40 - 5793.40] P:1802.18 E:0.072395 |  and these balloons burst.
[5793.40 - 5796.40] P:1808.29 E:0.090113 |  They can actually put the players off a little bit.
[5796.40 - 5799.40] P:1754.89 E:0.090708 |  But in fact, the tension's gone, the enjoyment's there.
[5799.40 - 5803.40] P:1676.67 E:0.097419 |  Sunshine, lovely warm day, enjoy singing some songs,
[5803.40 - 5807.40] P:1831.26 E:0.087696 |  and they'll get fed up singing them in about 14 hours' time.
[5809.40 - 5812.40] P:1699.78 E:0.103206 |  Those balloons are literally being popped.
[5812.40 - 5815.40] P:1638.87 E:0.113758 |  I think only for the sake of four minutes
[5815.40 - 5818.40] P:1700.25 E:0.105065 |  was Liverpool's party deflated when Solanke,
[5818.40 - 5820.40] P:2024.57 E:0.101094 |  a long time ago, gave Spurs the lead.
[5820.40 - 5822.40] P:1791.18 E:0.103482 |  Liverpool lead by five, goals to one.
[5822.40 - 5825.40] P:1774.77 E:0.088750 |  Another goal in Lyon, Victoria Polley.
[5825.40 - 5827.40] P:1728.85 E:0.094792 |  Green first half for Arsenal,
[5827.40 - 5830.40] P:1762.34 E:0.108606 |  and they've continued that almost immediately after the restart.
[5830.40 - 5833.40] P:1709.67 E:0.105292 |  Alessia Russo has extended Arsenal's lead,
[5833.40 - 5835.40] P:1606.76 E:0.103275 |  they've overturned the deficit,
[5835.40 - 5839.40] P:1782.37 E:0.090823 |  and they've gone further ahead in this one straight after half-time.
[5839.40 - 5842.40] P:1713.14 E:0.101797 |  It's now Arsenal who lead at Lyon 3-0, 4-2 on aggregate.
[5842.40 - 5845.40] P:1694.06 E:0.088952 |  What an excellent scoreline that is for Arsenal,
[5845.40 - 5848.40] P:1686.01 E:0.109256 |  as they look to try and set up a meeting with Barcelona.
[5848.40 - 5851.40] P:1673.03 E:0.110379 |  Liverpool have 12 minutes remaining, they're leading 5-1.
[5851.40 - 5855.40] P:1610.32 E:0.094999 |  Gravenberg, who's had an outstanding season,
[5855.40 - 5860.40] P:1795.74 E:0.096117 |  so effective, talked before about Virgil van Dijk playing the most minutes.
[5860.40 - 5863.40] P:1668.85 E:0.085203 |  Gravenberg, not that far behind him this season,
[5863.40 - 5868.40] P:1704.24 E:0.104696 |  his fellow Dutchman, two players who really have bottomed under there.
[5868.40 - 5870.40] P:1681.16 E:0.091371 |  Fellow countrymen in Arnau-Sloch.
[5871.40 - 5875.40] P:1498.38 E:0.099765 |  Just looking at a thing that happened in the pitch, it was very funny.
[5875.40 - 5878.40] P:1354.68 E:0.096210 |  You always get a lot of humour and leather too.
[5878.40 - 5883.40] P:1589.62 E:0.086600 |  They were bursting the balloons with their feet, and everyone is ignoring it.
[5883.40 - 5887.40] P:1759.70 E:0.104950 |  And then one of the balloons that was burst was the actual trophy.
[5887.40 - 5890.40] P:1754.73 E:0.089655 |  The whole place, dude, because a sparse player
[5890.40 - 5893.40] P:1747.36 E:0.093233 |  had actually burst the trophy of the balloon.
[5893.40 - 5895.40] P:1952.51 E:0.092676 |  The referee's stop-play.
[5895.40 - 5898.40] P:1839.61 E:0.096452 |  You can all remember the beach ball moment with Darren Bentot at Sunderland
[5898.40 - 5900.40] P:1822.81 E:0.102728 |  all those years ago, one of the balloons.
[5900.40 - 5902.40] P:1717.26 E:0.094108 |  It's almost as if the balloons are breeding.
[5902.40 - 5905.40] P:1866.20 E:0.094002 |  There's more balloons than there were before, they're having to be popped now.
[5905.40 - 5911.40] P:1746.19 E:0.096766 |  So we've got the remnants of the red of pop balloons on the blank surface.
[5911.40 - 5914.40] P:1819.07 E:0.086588 |  Mo Salah has picked one up and has actually just squeezed it
[5914.40 - 5921.40] P:1752.88 E:0.093990 |  and popped it with his hands as that deflated silver balloon,
[5921.40 - 5925.40] P:1823.69 E:0.110529 |  whether it was the two or the zero, just gently rolls its way towards the...
[5926.40 - 5928.40] P:1695.21 E:0.119047 |  I think that one was the trophy.
[5928.40 - 5930.40] P:1745.32 E:0.101043 |  Oh, was that the trophy?
[5930.40 - 5933.40] P:1682.57 E:0.103912 |  That's why the Liverpool fans say about Fjordis,
[5933.40 - 5936.40] P:1650.62 E:0.101219 |  how dare you stand in the trophy when we're going to win it?
[5936.40 - 5938.40] P:1730.25 E:0.105371 |  That's what they all say.
[5938.40 - 5940.40] P:1495.20 E:0.102944 |  Straight to Emily, John Southall.
[5940.40 - 5943.40] P:1581.33 E:0.104609 |  Forrest Nill, Manchester City 2, but our Forrest have had some chances in this second half.
[5943.40 - 5946.40] P:1607.44 E:0.110622 |  They've hit the post and they would work three times now,
[5946.40 - 5948.40] P:1457.10 E:0.111755 |  one year with the latest, Gibbs White on the rebound,
[5948.40 - 5952.40] P:1583.02 E:0.097283 |  header save, Forrest Nill, Manchester City 2.
[5952.40 - 5954.40] P:1897.94 E:0.095409 |  Coventry continues on Sports Extra.
[5954.40 - 5958.40] P:1743.53 E:0.086490 |  Match of the day tonight, incidentally, 10.30 on BBC One.
[5958.40 - 5960.40] P:1809.66 E:0.105293 |  Cross from Johnson on the right-hand side,
[5960.40 - 5962.40] P:1734.92 E:0.083544 |  Otterberg couldn't get there.
[5962.40 - 5964.40] P:1803.86 E:0.089460 |  Endo, who's playing at right back,
[5964.40 - 5968.40] P:1726.82 E:0.082775 |  instead of Alexander-Arnold, that goes out for a spurs throw.
[5968.40 - 5971.40] P:1775.07 E:0.077340 |  We've got ten minutes remaining here at Anfield.
[5971.40 - 5975.40] P:1826.51 E:0.098044 |  Five live, the World Service, and also available on the BBC Sounds app.
[5975.40 - 5977.40] P:1704.93 E:0.076086 |  And if you're a Liverpool supporter,
[5977.40 - 5980.40] P:1772.18 E:0.091874 |  wouldn't necessarily suggest this to any Tottenham fans,
[5980.40 - 5984.40] P:1645.21 E:0.088059 |  but the beauty of the BBC Sounds app is that you can go back,
[5984.40 - 5987.40] P:1478.71 E:0.090852 |  rewind and listen again.
[5987.40 - 5991.40] P:1750.79 E:0.111062 |  And the noise that has been generated inside this ground by the Liverpool supporters,
[5991.40 - 5993.40] P:1759.62 E:0.096601 |  as they raise the volume once more,
[5993.40 - 5998.40] P:1608.72 E:0.091562 |  is certainly that will live with many, I would imagine, for a long time.
[5998.40 - 6001.40] P:1754.46 E:0.104510 |  You must enjoy these occasions.
[6001.40 - 6004.40] P:1781.47 E:0.081714 |  As we say, right at the start, at the top of the programme,
[6004.40 - 6006.40] P:1798.81 E:0.088193 |  it doesn't happen that often.
[6006.40 - 6008.40] P:1717.13 E:0.087969 |  Even for the great clubs,
[6008.40 - 6012.40] P:1768.26 E:0.111323 |  it's quite often you go for long periods without winning these championships.
[6012.40 - 6015.40] P:1785.71 E:0.113718 |  And the better this championship, they've won it in style,
[6015.40 - 6018.40] P:1691.73 E:0.110078 |  they've won it early, just as I'm saying that,
[6018.40 - 6022.40] P:1597.66 E:0.089398 |  they'll remind them maybe it's champions, but, you know, savour it.
[6022.40 - 6025.40] P:1605.08 E:0.095718 |  You know, some clearly have worked showbiz for Scottish Football a lot
[6025.40 - 6028.40] P:1691.27 E:0.074988 |  and sell it at one of the 13 and the last 14.
[6028.40 - 6032.40] P:1642.01 E:0.094965 |  You know, even those fans don't take it for granted every single year.
[6032.40 - 6035.40] P:1752.94 E:0.075871 |  It's very, very special to win a league.
[6035.40 - 6037.40] P:1575.89 E:0.094278 |  So savour every morning here at Liverpool, fine.
[6037.40 - 6040.40] P:1558.39 E:0.082460 |  Either here or listening or watching.
[6040.40 - 6046.40] P:1732.64 E:0.099737 |  A historic weekend in north of the border, as well as in England, of course, with Celtic.
[6046.40 - 6050.40] P:1732.17 E:0.088292 |  The record equing 55th top-like title yesterday.
[6050.40 - 6054.40] P:1912.76 E:0.107667 |  Liverpool will join Manchester United, equing their tally of 20 here now,
[6054.40 - 6056.40] P:1833.58 E:0.085643 |  with nine minutes remaining,
[6056.40 - 6061.40] P:1795.81 E:0.089068 |  as a Liverpool player down on the far side,
[6061.40 - 6065.40] P:1737.64 E:0.101019 |  who's obscured to me because of the towering presence of Van Dijk, it's McAllister.
[6065.40 - 6068.40] P:1599.27 E:0.103909 |  It's McAllister. Let's get the solo one in the face.
[6068.40 - 6071.40] P:1807.81 E:0.103448 |  We're going to have to do a lot to keep him down just now, aren't we?
[6071.40 - 6073.40] P:1616.65 E:0.110702 |  He's a hard lad.
[6073.40 - 6076.40] P:1650.23 E:0.115636 |  But also, everybody wants to be on this pitch.
[6076.40 - 6081.40] P:1670.19 E:0.093136 |  With nine minutes of normal time left to play, you'd love to be on the pitch.
[6081.40 - 6084.40] P:1733.52 E:0.088392 |  And someone else is going to get a chance to go on the pitch.
[6084.40 - 6086.40] P:1587.85 E:0.100956 |  I was going to say on the window, what's up, there?
[6086.40 - 6088.40] P:1587.52 E:0.082452 |  Reception, Darwin, Nunes, OK.
[6088.40 - 6092.40] P:1654.99 E:0.081336 |  But anyone could know they're red, so we'll get a good reception today.
[6092.40 - 6096.40] P:1734.53 E:0.088828 |  There has been a report in Portugal that his next start could trigger a clause
[6096.40 - 6100.40] P:1847.48 E:0.102400 |  that would mean that they have to pay something like 5 million euros to Van Fique,
[6100.40 - 6104.40] P:1898.30 E:0.092178 |  that Arnaz Sloc just tried to dodge in his press conference coming into the game.
[6104.40 - 6109.40] P:1808.31 E:0.100314 |  It's fair to say that Darwin Nunes may well be moved on in the summer.
[6109.40 - 6113.40] P:1977.05 E:0.100251 |  He's only had one start since early February.
[6113.40 - 6117.40] P:1782.30 E:0.093774 |  But he has become a little bit of a cult figure here,
[6117.40 - 6120.40] P:1874.42 E:0.098173 |  just because of his hard work, his desire levels.
[6120.40 - 6125.40] P:1721.34 E:0.099894 |  And he waits to come on, and it will be Macalester who will be going on.
[6127.40 - 6131.40] P:1944.52 E:0.106794 |  As Liverpool prepare to make another change.
[6131.40 - 6133.40] P:1907.89 E:0.113198 |  Yeah, another new attempt to try and tell you,
[6133.40 - 6135.40] P:1819.64 E:0.114507 |  was that some level of play in just now?
[6135.40 - 6138.40] P:1872.42 E:0.110716 |  They've just given people a game as much as anything else.
[6138.40 - 6142.40] P:1996.24 E:0.097481 |  And Macalester's got a great reception here, hasn't he?
[6143.40 - 6145.40] P:2099.28 E:0.088874 |  APPLAUSE
[6145.40 - 6149.40] P:1941.26 E:0.111394 |  Stunning ovation for Macalester, a high five from his manager.
[6149.40 - 6152.40] P:1968.36 E:0.096439 |  And Darwin Nunes comes on,
[6152.40 - 6158.40] P:2023.64 E:0.089388 |  as every Liverpool supporter inside Anfield stands.
[6160.40 - 6164.40] P:1930.25 E:0.092413 |  As part of the celebrations with seven and a half minutes remaining,
[6164.40 - 6170.40] P:1939.59 E:0.075103 |  still there is a healthy number of Tottenham fans who have remained loyal to the end.
[6170.40 - 6173.40] P:1966.52 E:0.061000 |  They will need their supporters to play their bit.
[6173.40 - 6176.40] P:1846.99 E:0.092396 |  They'll need the team to play their bit on Thursday as well.
[6176.40 - 6179.40] P:1859.55 E:0.093112 |  You can't help but feel they're going to need some sort of a healthy lead
[6179.40 - 6182.40] P:1913.43 E:0.070311 |  to take to Norway with that plastic pitch with a second leg.
[6182.40 - 6187.40] P:1941.98 E:0.094102 |  In just over, well, two weeks' time, or less than two weeks' time, in the Europa League.
[6187.40 - 6190.40] P:1976.20 E:0.103900 |  That's the look forward to on five live during the week.
[6190.40 - 6194.40] P:1868.66 E:0.104776 |  Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, Europa League on Thursday.
[6194.40 - 6198.40] P:1946.40 E:0.095936 |  This is the Premier League, five live in the World Service.
[6198.40 - 6201.40] P:1949.35 E:0.101020 |  And Liverpool leading by five goals to one.
[6201.40 - 6203.40] P:1975.38 E:0.085364 |  Canate back with Van Dijk.
[6203.40 - 6207.40] P:1941.02 E:0.083977 |  Van Dijk's record, there'll be the 11th different Liverpool captain
[6207.40 - 6209.40] P:1846.51 E:0.085815 |  to eventually get his hands on the title.
[6209.40 - 6213.40] P:1961.79 E:0.082233 |  There'll be the first touchment to captain a team to a Premier League title.
[6213.40 - 6220.40] P:1964.93 E:0.081097 |  But he's only had three defeats in what now will be 117 Premier League home games.
[6220.40 - 6222.40] P:1873.56 E:0.075802 |  Leads Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest.
[6222.40 - 6224.40] P:1831.04 E:0.076528 |  That is a very impressive record.
[6224.40 - 6227.40] P:1760.08 E:0.094674 |  Yeah, it's a great record and the stats sound great as well.
[6227.40 - 6229.40] P:1846.35 E:0.063916 |  But it's more than that.
[6229.40 - 6232.40] P:1870.83 E:0.089471 |  I mean, there is a big argument about Mo Salah between the two of them,
[6232.40 - 6237.40] P:1734.75 E:0.088160 |  who has been the most important player for Liverpool over a good long period now,
[6237.40 - 6240.40] P:1788.22 E:0.078763 |  in a real successful period.
[6240.40 - 6245.40] P:1616.92 E:0.083800 |  And where Loat might say, I think Van Dijk may be slightly more important
[6245.40 - 6247.40] P:1706.12 E:0.114835 |  because of what he's done.
[6247.40 - 6250.40] P:1705.86 E:0.106955 |  They're on and off the field to the group, what has shown them.
[6250.40 - 6253.40] P:1642.46 E:0.096797 |  And the genius of his play as well.
[6254.40 - 6257.40] P:1693.23 E:0.116099 |  Lele Lele Le is the latest champion side on field.
[6257.40 - 6260.40] P:1567.25 E:0.116894 |  Salah picks up the ball on the right-hand side.
[6260.40 - 6264.40] P:1685.52 E:0.099023 |  Tristan Wrigley's way past the doggy and cleared by Saat.
[6264.40 - 6269.40] P:1770.86 E:0.099641 |  Mo Salah, who is likely to win the Golden Boot for a fourth time
[6269.40 - 6272.40] P:1905.47 E:0.111227 |  to equal the record of Thierry-Henri.
[6272.40 - 6276.40] P:1931.19 E:0.089321 |  It'll be his first Golden Boot in three years.
[6276.40 - 6278.40] P:1644.25 E:0.104010 |  Yeah, but he never lets you down.
[6278.40 - 6281.40] P:1596.83 E:0.111525 |  He keeps on going. He keeps on doing brilliant, brilliant possessions.
[6281.40 - 6285.40] P:1705.38 E:0.115142 |  I think he's looked better this season as it's going on.
[6285.40 - 6290.40] P:1802.29 E:0.105012 |  He's usually a little bit of a dick, but you'll notice even within that,
[6290.40 - 6294.40] P:1767.84 E:0.109746 |  he's still creating chances, he's still creating goals even if he's not scoring them.
[6294.40 - 6300.40] P:1741.13 E:0.100245 |  But his numbers over the last number of seasons for someone who's not set her forward
[6300.40 - 6302.40] P:1610.94 E:0.084923 |  are just ridiculous.
[6302.40 - 6306.40] P:1740.07 E:0.111663 |  A reminder, we're on air until 7 o'clock tonight as Salah picks it up
[6306.40 - 6310.40] P:1878.55 E:0.100056 |  and pays the ball in and it was cut out by...
[6310.40 - 6314.40] P:1955.93 E:0.111453 |  The doggy who just threw himself at it at the near side of the six-yard box
[6314.40 - 6316.40] P:1836.54 E:0.114418 |  to divert the ball away for a throw.
[6316.40 - 6321.40] P:1641.43 E:0.107007 |  We'll try and bring you as much live reaction as we can before we hand to 606
[6321.40 - 6323.40] P:1579.70 E:0.094519 |  with Roman Kemp and Chris Sutton.
[6323.40 - 6327.40] P:1629.84 E:0.111720 |  But if we're not able to do that before 7 o'clock here on Five Live,
[6327.40 - 6330.40] P:1545.93 E:0.103482 |  then don't forget the Five Live football daily fee.
[6330.40 - 6335.40] P:1654.18 E:0.102410 |  We'll bring you all the reaction as we soak up as much as we possibly can
[6335.40 - 6338.40] P:1514.02 E:0.078867 |  down in the tunnel here at Anfield
[6338.40 - 6341.40] P:1796.22 E:0.094205 |  on the significant day for Liverpool Football Club,
[6341.40 - 6345.40] P:1903.60 E:0.095403 |  who leads Spurs by five goals to one, four and a half minutes of normal time remain.
[6345.40 - 6349.40] P:1619.24 E:0.093600 |  I just see him on date playing one of those balls that he's so good at.
[6349.40 - 6353.40] P:1828.07 E:0.112920 |  He doesn't do it as often, you know, he used to do quite a lot.
[6353.40 - 6357.40] P:1869.73 E:0.104652 |  It's a 60-70-yard pass, he's languid, he's pinpoint,
[6357.40 - 6360.40] P:1793.78 E:0.093835 |  almost puts Andy Robertson through.
[6360.40 - 6364.40] P:1525.51 E:0.102319 |  But he chooses his time to play that ball now and he used to do it much more often.
[6364.40 - 6368.40] P:1705.03 E:0.096296 |  I think he's looking after his stance, doesn't want to give the ball away.
[6369.40 - 6377.40] P:1896.27 E:0.098692 |  Harvey Elliott wanders across as he acknowledges the supporters by clapping back at them
[6377.40 - 6380.40] P:1777.93 E:0.093369 |  in front of the corner and then he takes it quickly to Curtis Jones,
[6380.40 - 6383.40] P:1904.05 E:0.099067 |  edge of the area, Jones shot, takes the inflection loops in the air,
[6383.40 - 6387.40] P:1810.16 E:0.106041 |  Vicario's come, Vicario hasn't got there, the referee's blown his whistle.
[6387.40 - 6391.40] P:1816.89 E:0.096433 |  Free kick to Spurs, still Liverpool 5-1, just over three minutes remain.
[6391.40 - 6394.40] P:1599.01 E:0.091930 |  And Liverpool just love to get another goal.
[6394.40 - 6397.40] P:1651.78 E:0.092057 |  Tottenham in the moment, would love that final whistle to blow.
[6397.40 - 6400.40] P:1562.01 E:0.100637 |  It's been a really chastening second half for them.
[6400.40 - 6404.40] P:1572.12 E:0.094903 |  They've tried to get forwards as often as they could, but in some attempts,
[6404.40 - 6407.40] P:1538.66 E:0.100714 |  in almost every... Well, let's take away the almost.
[6407.40 - 6411.40] P:1626.32 E:0.094463 |  In every single position, they've been second best today.
[6412.40 - 6415.40] P:1624.38 E:0.112848 |  And Liverpool, who have been the best side in the Premier League this season,
[6415.40 - 6420.40] P:1644.74 E:0.095994 |  remember they went on that 26-game and beaten run from mid-September to early April.
[6421.40 - 6427.40] P:1658.57 E:0.095281 |  Are just minutes away from being confirmed.
[6428.40 - 6434.40] P:1607.64 E:0.111768 |  But the supporters throughout the afternoon have just been enjoying every single second of this.
[6434.40 - 6439.40] P:1575.57 E:0.108587 |  This is the type of afternoon that even those of a nervous disposition
[6439.40 - 6442.40] P:1584.88 E:0.093209 |  were just able to sit back and revel in.
[6442.40 - 6446.40] P:1607.19 E:0.109757 |  What a relaxation it is, if you're a Liverpool fan, to just enjoy this,
[6446.40 - 6450.40] P:1552.17 E:0.100514 |  just to sing along, watch a team playing good football,
[6450.40 - 6453.40] P:1483.60 E:0.089286 |  having scored five goals, and most of all, running it,
[6453.40 - 6456.40] P:1713.45 E:0.110762 |  people just enjoying themselves as well.
[6456.40 - 6461.40] P:1838.21 E:0.113072 |  From the left of the ball by a doggy, no foul, up towards Rich Ellison.
[6461.40 - 6465.40] P:1791.32 E:0.119436 |  Pushed over from behind, Liverpool supporters enjoyed that,
[6465.40 - 6468.40] P:1664.03 E:0.104886 |  and it'll be a great kick to Tottenham.
[6470.40 - 6473.40] P:1763.46 E:0.094483 |  No reaction at all from Rich Ellison.
[6473.40 - 6476.40] P:1682.78 E:0.088050 |  There is no answer in a day like this.
[6476.40 - 6479.40] P:1703.75 E:0.100036 |  You just get your head down, you work.
[6479.40 - 6482.40] P:1600.39 E:0.111552 |  The vast majority of players that play at a total level
[6482.40 - 6485.40] P:1645.92 E:0.099858 |  have actually found themselves, you know, at and field,
[6485.40 - 6489.40] P:1619.64 E:0.091564 |  in the wrong side of a beating, when you hardly can get a kick to the ball,
[6489.40 - 6492.40] P:1697.74 E:0.075877 |  you just get your head down and work, you just deal with it.
[6492.40 - 6495.40] P:1643.58 E:0.073595 |  And as soon as you get off that pitch, you get off it.
[6495.40 - 6499.40] P:1727.10 E:0.095576 |  This is going to be an 11th defeat on their travels for Spurs.
[6499.40 - 6502.40] P:1753.50 E:0.097369 |  Only Leicester and Southampton have lost more on the road.
[6502.40 - 6507.40] P:1629.33 E:0.097907 |  The last time that they lost 11 was the 2008-2009 campaign.
[6507.40 - 6511.40] P:1615.29 E:0.099003 |  They finished 8th that particular season.
[6511.40 - 6518.40] P:1666.42 E:0.099264 |  They're actually on course to finish lower than where they managed 21 years ago.
[6518.40 - 6522.40] P:1600.37 E:0.095803 |  That was when they finished 14th in 2004.
[6524.40 - 6528.40] P:1696.96 E:0.087879 |  They could say that they're going to focus on the Europa League,
[6528.40 - 6532.40] P:1745.59 E:0.079178 |  but it has been a dreadfully disappointing campaign
[6532.40 - 6536.40] P:1721.27 E:0.072133 |  when you consider that this time last season they were 5th.
[6536.40 - 6540.40] P:1685.11 E:0.096089 |  They were in a position where many people now are clamouring to get to.
[6540.40 - 6544.40] P:1634.24 E:0.089895 |  Yeah, expecting to just move on from there.
[6544.40 - 6547.40] P:1606.99 E:0.087367 |  It just hasn't harmed the height of Pat Virgale.
[6547.40 - 6550.40] P:1493.09 E:0.080988 |  Pat Virgale with the cross headed away.
[6550.40 - 6556.40] P:1708.26 E:0.107209 |  Still testing for it in the Liverpool half, and now Jota passes it all forward.
[6556.40 - 6560.40] P:1867.66 E:0.116748 |  Nunez pulls it back towards Salah.
[6560.40 - 6563.40] P:1826.19 E:0.118098 |  They were desperate for Nunez to go for goal himself.
[6563.40 - 6565.40] P:1869.04 E:0.103328 |  Salah towards Elliott.
[6565.40 - 6569.40] P:1837.58 E:0.101211 |  Elliott shoots, blocks, and then down with header.
[6569.40 - 6574.40] P:1874.23 E:0.094713 |  Elliott will pick up that loose ball, looks to link up with Robertson.
[6574.40 - 6576.40] P:1903.16 E:0.108994 |  They could have had another there.
[6576.40 - 6578.40] P:1754.95 E:0.103891 |  You know what people are going to say, don't you?
[6578.40 - 6581.40] P:1792.29 E:0.097742 |  That's Darwin. That's the problem with Darwin, isn't it?
[6581.40 - 6584.40] P:1820.62 E:0.096502 |  He's one-on-one, and he tries to do the right thing,
[6584.40 - 6589.40] P:1822.62 E:0.081783 |  and it is the right thing if you find the player in the middle there.
[6589.40 - 6591.40] P:1745.02 E:0.091921 |  But it's a poor ball, it's ahead of him.
[6591.40 - 6593.40] P:1704.31 E:0.084553 |  Just zip it into most Salah's feet.
[6593.40 - 6596.40] P:1747.73 E:0.106278 |  You cope with anything, you don't need to put it in front of him.
[6596.40 - 6597.40] P:1841.46 E:0.093056 |  You cope with anything.
[6597.40 - 6601.40] P:1744.47 E:0.082647 |  He plays it too far in front of him, but there's another part of the things.
[6601.40 - 6606.40] P:1773.56 E:0.087299 |  Look, Stryker's trying to do the right thing in pass when 95% of them
[6606.40 - 6608.40] P:1767.67 E:0.097695 |  would try and smash it towards the goal.
[6608.40 - 6610.40] P:1815.44 E:0.101122 |  You want to applaud them, but...
[6610.40 - 6611.40] P:1738.53 E:0.117324 |  Difficult to do it with Nunez.
[6611.40 - 6613.40] P:1750.99 E:0.094817 |  Easy ones, it makes him mess off.
[6613.40 - 6616.40] P:1708.14 E:0.109116 |  The hard ones, let us in at the top corner.
[6617.40 - 6620.40] P:1615.56 E:0.099601 |  I think that would have just been the moment, wouldn't it,
[6620.40 - 6623.40] P:1490.32 E:0.099568 |  for Darwin Nunez to have got that goal.
[6623.40 - 6625.40] P:1593.41 E:0.113344 |  Four minutes have added on time.
[6629.40 - 6632.40] P:1697.53 E:0.121743 |  Is it going to cue doing this somewhere as soon as you've got the 90th minute?
[6632.40 - 6634.40] P:1660.36 E:0.111938 |  He starts singing this song.
[6635.40 - 6636.40] P:1850.09 E:0.130361 |  Always the case.
[6638.40 - 6639.40] P:1418.35 E:0.116606 |  And only now...
[6640.40 - 6643.40] P:1642.95 E:0.105428 |  ..as a banner being unfurled in the Cop
[6643.40 - 6645.40] P:1685.90 E:0.099595 |  with a picture of Arnaz Slopp
[6646.40 - 6649.40] P:1611.36 E:0.111863 |  that reads champions for the 20th time.
[6649.40 - 6652.40] P:1691.86 E:0.115217 |  24, 20-25.
[6653.40 - 6658.40] P:1631.14 E:0.103160 |  As the red and white scarves are held aloft all the way around Anfield.
[6658.40 - 6661.40] P:1810.79 E:0.086992 |  There's a solitary flag that waves in the Cop
[6661.40 - 6664.40] P:1570.58 E:0.115999 |  and now there is another banner in black and white.
[6664.40 - 6665.40] P:1730.08 E:0.092822 |  Arnaz champions.
[6665.40 - 6666.40] P:1793.84 E:0.102128 |  Arnaz champions.
[6667.40 - 6671.40] P:1670.06 E:0.094359 |  He tasted success with a title in Holland
[6671.40 - 6674.40] P:1815.54 E:0.090305 |  with Feyenoord in 2023.
[6674.40 - 6676.40] P:1939.91 E:0.083774 |  His first season in English football.
[6676.40 - 6678.40] P:1821.67 E:0.095572 |  He will be a champion in England.
[6678.40 - 6682.40] P:1718.55 E:0.092995 |  Intriguing to see the reaction, you're going to get down on that bench.
[6682.40 - 6686.40] P:1639.64 E:0.086463 |  You know, you're only supposed to have one standing up at a time.
[6686.40 - 6689.40] P:1719.71 E:0.095740 |  Well, there's about six or seven or eight all standing down
[6689.40 - 6691.40] P:1671.22 E:0.081617 |  in that technical area.
[6691.40 - 6694.40] P:1684.39 E:0.082096 |  And even though they've known it for some time,
[6694.40 - 6697.40] P:1741.61 E:0.098994 |  I mean, maybe weeks, maybe months, they're going to win the league.
[6697.40 - 6702.40] P:2000.31 E:0.106198 |  The interest is he, the reaction from all the players
[6702.40 - 6704.40] P:2009.41 E:0.106503 |  from Slott himself,
[6705.40 - 6709.40] P:1999.38 E:0.106704 |  from all the staff there, because it's been a long wait.
[6709.40 - 6713.40] P:2024.38 E:0.105129 |  And whatever they do, just get on there and enjoy it.
[6714.40 - 6716.40] P:1978.64 E:0.116696 |  Nunes forward for Liverpool.
[6716.40 - 6718.40] P:2020.49 E:0.083287 |  Jones, Jotter.
[6718.40 - 6719.40] P:2122.82 E:0.122050 |  Nunes will shoot.
[6720.40 - 6723.40] P:2033.70 E:0.100108 |  Blocked by Dan Sobe, high in for a corner kick.
[6723.40 - 6727.40] P:1982.84 E:0.098006 |  We're into the second minute of the minimum of four to be added on.
[6727.40 - 6730.40] P:1936.06 E:0.094722 |  The cameras are trained on the Liverpool bench.
[6730.40 - 6733.40] P:2007.95 E:0.093288 |  The Liverpool substitutes are turning to wave
[6733.40 - 6736.40] P:1989.22 E:0.084063 |  at their loved ones behind them in the main stand.
[6737.40 - 6740.40] P:2084.15 E:0.111998 |  A line of stewards in their orange luminous jackets
[6740.40 - 6743.40] P:1963.40 E:0.092605 |  are sat down in front of the advertising hoardings.
[6744.40 - 6748.40] P:1926.12 E:0.112963 |  A red smoke bomb is away towards our left-hand side.
[6748.40 - 6752.40] P:1900.12 E:0.093963 |  Another incessant chant of champions, champions.
[6752.40 - 6754.40] P:1969.94 E:0.106841 |  Reverberates inside Anfield.
[6754.40 - 6756.40] P:2060.12 E:0.088273 |  They lead Tottenham by five goals to one.
[6756.40 - 6760.40] P:2063.38 E:0.081403 |  In comes the corner, headed away by Davis.
[6761.40 - 6764.40] P:1898.18 E:0.060446 |  Van Dyke to Canate.
[6764.40 - 6768.40] P:1921.90 E:0.078538 |  Helps it out, Robertson can't keep the ball in play.
[6770.40 - 6773.40] P:1963.78 E:0.118784 |  And now the chance of we shall not be moved.
[6773.40 - 6777.40] P:2030.38 E:0.099579 |  It's just a question.
[6779.40 - 6781.40] P:1923.66 E:0.115393 |  And we're about 60 seconds away, Pat.
[6781.40 - 6785.40] P:1892.61 E:0.099132 |  Yeah, Rich Allison, he can go back there.
[6785.40 - 6787.40] P:1950.27 E:0.085307 |  I'll make him very popular there.
[6787.40 - 6789.40] P:1957.50 E:0.090073 |  And I think it's certainly a challenge,
[6789.40 - 6791.40] P:1778.30 E:0.111324 |  and I'll get a Yermol Cal.
[6791.40 - 6793.40] P:1958.55 E:0.121897 |  I wonder if he'll go both ways.
[6793.40 - 6795.40] P:1881.05 E:0.103892 |  Yeah, Arvelli will get one as well.
[6795.40 - 6797.40] P:1875.75 E:0.081378 |  No need for that at that moment,
[6797.40 - 6800.40] P:1962.93 E:0.084513 |  but you can tell us about a frustration down there,
[6800.40 - 6802.40] P:1903.82 E:0.100651 |  as you're Rich Allison.
[6802.40 - 6804.40] P:1911.65 E:0.092150 |  He tried hard to keep his head down before.
[6804.40 - 6806.40] P:2062.03 E:0.092404 |  Fielding the execution.
[6806.40 - 6811.40] P:1884.77 E:0.109752 |  Elliott and Rich Allison, both booked by referee Thomas Bramble.
[6811.40 - 6816.40] P:1764.69 E:0.087112 |  Harvey Elliott wouldn't want to be sent off on a day like this,
[6816.40 - 6819.40] P:1948.97 E:0.083017 |  as the substitutes and the coaching staff down below
[6819.40 - 6821.40] P:1898.75 E:0.088842 |  are all poised.
[6821.40 - 6823.40] P:2030.72 E:0.099002 |  They're embracing each other in the technical area.
[6823.40 - 6825.40] P:1797.55 E:0.082003 |  Cody Gatpo going down the line.
[6825.40 - 6827.40] P:1976.28 E:0.100291 |  The two Dutchmen embrace.
[6827.40 - 6830.40] P:2054.08 E:0.082975 |  The Liverpool striker and the Liverpool manager.
[6830.40 - 6834.40] P:2034.38 E:0.097710 |  By my watch, we have 15 seconds remaining.
[6834.40 - 6837.40] P:1924.19 E:0.109162 |  Liverpool lead by five goals to one.
[6837.40 - 6840.40] P:2091.97 E:0.099894 |  Fireworks being let off outside the stadium.
[6840.40 - 6843.40] P:1904.30 E:0.095226 |  Vicario catches the ball.
[6843.40 - 6846.40] P:1980.48 E:0.109205 |  They're forming a line ready to celebrate.
[6848.40 - 6852.40] P:1920.12 E:0.120029 |  They said five years ago that it didn't feel real.
[6852.40 - 6855.40] P:2018.11 E:0.122245 |  Well, it feels real now.
[6855.40 - 6860.40] P:1978.03 E:0.114965 |  Five years ago, due to Covid and social distancing,
[6860.40 - 6863.40] P:1998.35 E:0.112128 |  they were unable to celebrate.
[6863.40 - 6868.40] P:1965.81 E:0.110266 |  The only distance now is the 15 points that Liverpool have
[6868.40 - 6871.40] P:1888.74 E:0.107737 |  at the top of the Premier League.
[6871.40 - 6876.40] P:1982.46 E:0.103771 |  And for the first time in 12,783 days,
[6876.40 - 6881.40] P:1969.80 E:0.106403 |  they are able to celebrate in front of their own supporters.
[6881.40 - 6884.40] P:2021.16 E:0.103386 |  Liverpool are back on that perch.
[6884.40 - 6888.40] P:1990.54 E:0.102116 |  It's a record-equalling 20th shot-glide title.
[6890.40 - 6892.40] P:1968.90 E:0.102292 |  Finally deserved.
[6892.40 - 6895.40] P:1964.76 E:0.102883 |  Congratulations to Liverpool and all the fans as well.
[6895.40 - 6897.40] P:1984.30 E:0.093735 |  They showed today.
[6897.40 - 6901.40] P:1861.57 E:0.099150 |  You want to walk out in your last game when you win it
[6901.40 - 6904.40] P:1887.12 E:0.093945 |  to come off thinking that's why we're champions.
[6904.40 - 6906.40] P:2018.27 E:0.093267 |  And they did it today.
[6906.40 - 6908.40] P:2015.93 E:0.104133 |  It's a lovely feeling as a player.
[6908.40 - 6911.40] P:2001.53 E:0.091616 |  If the moment is that special, and it is beautiful,
[6911.40 - 6913.40] P:1931.34 E:0.104440 |  and you have scored the goals,
[6913.40 - 6918.40] P:1973.40 E:0.097059 |  and you can celebrate with comfort, with the joy of it,
[6918.40 - 6921.40] P:2026.73 E:0.082710 |  with the pure pleasure of knowing you deserve it,
[6921.40 - 6924.40] P:1944.37 E:0.097890 |  you're the best team, you play great football,
[6924.40 - 6926.40] P:1969.55 E:0.093915 |  and you're going to get better next year.
[6926.40 - 6928.40] P:1979.63 E:0.099050 |  What a great feeling it is around this place.
[6928.40 - 6931.40] P:1957.82 E:0.081549 |  Celebrating, and this is just the start.
[6931.40 - 6937.40] P:2049.44 E:0.095674 |  There must be at least 20 red smoke bombs that have been let off,
[6937.40 - 6940.40] P:2083.23 E:0.101634 |  not just in the carp, not just in the Saqueredal Gliche.
[6940.40 - 6942.40] P:2026.07 E:0.087752 |  Not just in the Anfield Road,
[6942.40 - 6944.40] P:2068.23 E:0.114843 |  but also in the main stand.
[6944.40 - 6946.40] P:2038.62 E:0.107963 |  There's a line of stewards that have formed,
[6946.40 - 6950.40] P:2049.13 E:0.093430 |  not one supporter has entered the pitch here at Anfield,
[6950.40 - 6954.40] P:2072.35 E:0.103450 |  and with the sun still shining, and so much clear blue sky,
[6954.40 - 6958.40] P:2121.56 E:0.103895 |  Liverpool have so much daylight at the top of the Premier League,
[6958.40 - 6960.40] P:2047.70 E:0.111115 |  and they are going to enjoy this,
[6960.40 - 6963.40] P:2049.86 E:0.102077 |  because they are the champions of England,
[6963.40 - 6966.40] P:2004.04 E:0.099160 |  beating Tottenham-Hosper by five goals to one.
[6966.40 - 6968.40] P:1961.53 E:0.081685 |  Five goals to one.
[6970.40 - 6976.40] P:1854.75 E:0.100620 |  And these inside Anfield are just amazing scenes,
[6976.40 - 6981.40] P:1924.15 E:0.095095 |  when those fireworks started to go off outside the stadium,
[6981.40 - 6984.40] P:1881.19 E:0.089764 |  the thud, boom, boom.
[6985.40 - 6991.40] P:1957.97 E:0.094381 |  It was like the collective heartbeat of Anfield coming out of its chest.
[6991.40 - 6995.40] P:1851.17 E:0.093382 |  The air is thick with sulphur.
[6996.40 - 7002.40] P:1916.62 E:0.104657 |  A red cloud has just emerged to our right-hand side.
[7003.40 - 7006.40] P:1971.42 E:0.089236 |  It was a remarkable moment, Pat Nevin,
[7006.40 - 7014.40] P:1950.67 E:0.085175 |  when Mo Salah scored, because it felt like the emotional dam inside Anfield cracked,
[7014.40 - 7017.40] P:1874.36 E:0.085027 |  and then the full-time whistle went and it broke.
[7017.40 - 7020.40] P:1721.96 E:0.098077 |  Yeah, as you say, we'll wait a long time
[7020.40 - 7022.40] P:1807.61 E:0.097896 |  if you're a Liverpool fan.
[7022.40 - 7026.40] P:1815.53 E:0.097422 |  I'm sure you might have thought, they will say, we have waited, and waited.
[7026.40 - 7032.40] P:1883.59 E:0.093776 |  So the fact that you can go and watch Mo Salah go and finish it,
[7032.40 - 7036.40] P:1835.73 E:0.108134 |  Mo Salah, of all people, nipping from there,
[7036.40 - 7039.40] P:1899.85 E:0.104990 |  and just ping it down the bottom corner,
[7039.40 - 7043.40] P:1855.94 E:0.096788 |  it's like perfection, and to win the game and get five goals,
[7043.40 - 7045.40] P:1884.76 E:0.094362 |  after just a little bit of jeopardy,
[7045.40 - 7049.40] P:1852.55 E:0.101175 |  just a tiny wee bit of jeopardy at the start of the game.
[7049.40 - 7053.40] P:1847.11 E:0.092940 |  And I don't think as a Liverpool player who woke up there thinking,
[7053.40 - 7056.40] P:1903.67 E:0.098278 |  I didn't play too well today, I played really well.
[7056.40 - 7059.40] P:1945.90 E:0.092925 |  Everyone all think that I had a good game today,
[7059.40 - 7061.40] P:1808.33 E:0.101320 |  my team had a good game today, the manager would think,
[7061.40 - 7063.40] P:1865.92 E:0.090625 |  I put a good side out today,
[7063.40 - 7066.40] P:1770.59 E:0.096385 |  the fans would think we played our part today.
[7066.40 - 7070.40] P:1891.87 E:0.088629 |  I'm really struggling to find, well, not that I'm waiting for a win,
[7070.40 - 7075.40] P:1980.52 E:0.112321 |  but I'm really struggling to find a negative of this day for Liverpool Football Club.
[7076.40 - 7079.40] P:2005.42 E:0.102081 |  Well, the Liverpool players now are right in front of their fans,
[7079.40 - 7083.40] P:1979.48 E:0.094061 |  Trent Alexander-Arnold is down there, whipping them up again,
[7083.40 - 7088.40] P:1949.19 E:0.095257 |  Mo Salah is now just draped in a big Liverpool flag
[7088.40 - 7091.40] P:1891.33 E:0.089789 |  in front of the fans to the right-hand side,
[7091.40 - 7095.40] P:1971.35 E:0.100569 |  and all of the signs and all of the banners are out now.
[7095.40 - 7099.40] P:1881.67 E:0.098684 |  I could see in the last few minutes those fans down to our right
[7099.40 - 7102.40] P:1936.04 E:0.098886 |  looking at each other nervously with their flag.
[7102.40 - 7105.40] P:1919.46 E:0.093037 |  Is it time to get it out? Shall we wait?
[7105.40 - 7111.40] P:1989.76 E:0.092219 |  And then it emerged, Arnav Slopp, Liverpool champions, 20 times.
[7111.40 - 7115.40] P:1962.33 E:0.093598 |  This stadium is different to others.
[7115.40 - 7119.40] P:1937.23 E:0.100811 |  Some stadiums, you will see the history of them
[7119.40 - 7122.40] P:1990.03 E:0.104279 |  all over the walls inside the ground.
[7122.40 - 7126.40] P:1972.19 E:0.092986 |  This many trophies, this many titles, this many victories.
[7126.40 - 7130.40] P:1819.53 E:0.100716 |  In Anfield, Pat Nevin, as more fireworks
[7130.40 - 7134.40] P:1915.71 E:0.106576 |  fly up into the sky to our right-hand side,
[7134.40 - 7138.40] P:1976.06 E:0.099466 |  the history emerges from the cock,
[7138.40 - 7142.40] P:1959.69 E:0.102377 |  the banners go up, the signs go up, the fireworks go up.
[7142.40 - 7147.40] P:1924.86 E:0.093067 |  Yeah, to be honest, you can go away to black and white days
[7147.40 - 7150.40] P:1900.09 E:0.104976 |  all the way back to when there was no seats in the cock,
[7150.40 - 7154.40] P:1949.62 E:0.097437 |  and the different way that that looked through the other stadiums
[7154.40 - 7159.40] P:1982.16 E:0.091360 |  because the fans were moving almost as a mass, almost as an organism,
[7159.40 - 7163.40] P:1946.47 E:0.101413 |  and you look at it now and it still feels like a real stadium.
[7163.40 - 7167.40] P:1886.06 E:0.096655 |  There are some stadiums around the country that don't feel real.
[7167.40 - 7171.40] P:1863.94 E:0.094587 |  Even in big moments, right now I'm looking around a stadium.
[7171.40 - 7175.40] P:1820.53 E:0.091062 |  Can you see one empty red seat?
[7175.40 - 7178.40] P:1886.50 E:0.102076 |  Nope, and you won't see one for quite some time.
[7178.40 - 7183.40] P:1868.05 E:0.091067 |  It is loving the football, loving the moment, loving what it means to their city.
[7183.40 - 7185.40] P:1916.15 E:0.086961 |  There'd be lots of great banners.
[7185.40 - 7188.40] P:1817.33 E:0.095879 |  There was one banner, I think, stood out very well there for me.
[7188.40 - 7196.40] P:1854.41 E:0.091167 |  There was just a picture of the Liverpool's signature back on our perch.
[7196.40 - 7198.40] P:1867.22 E:0.098003 |  I thought, oh, that's clever, that's neat.
[7198.40 - 7202.40] P:1860.62 E:0.093349 |  They've been waiting for that one, and it's kind of, this club kills that.
[7202.40 - 7205.40] P:1832.43 E:0.103616 |  This club kills it if they deserve to be right on top.
[7205.40 - 7209.40] P:1845.10 E:0.102266 |  It's been hard for Manchester City to be so dominant for such a long time,
[7209.40 - 7212.40] P:1864.51 E:0.105327 |  and Liverpool have chased them down so many times.
[7212.40 - 7217.40] P:1892.04 E:0.097770 |  They've got them once, but this time they've actually been able to enjoy it.
[7217.40 - 7219.40] P:1876.18 E:0.088956 |  That's not always been the case, has it?
[7219.40 - 7221.40] P:1929.10 E:0.095775 |  They've been able to enjoy this bit.
[7221.40 - 7225.40] P:1953.24 E:0.091609 |  These last few games, but right now, and until the end of the season,
[7225.40 - 7229.40] P:2004.12 E:0.086030 |  it's just fun, it's just celebration, it's just singing.
[7229.40 - 7234.40] P:2030.60 E:0.100840 |  Well, we've been saying all afternoon that Liverpool fans have been waiting
[7234.40 - 7241.40] P:1989.51 E:0.091651 |  since 1990 to celebrate a title with their players on a day like this.
[7241.40 - 7244.40] P:1895.50 E:0.097114 |  Back in 1990, we didn't have mobile phones.
[7244.40 - 7249.40] P:1987.18 E:0.100700 |  In 2025, Mo Salah took a selfie when his shot hit the back of the net.
[7249.40 - 7252.40] P:1927.65 E:0.096843 |  Harvey Elliott has just booted the match ball.
[7252.40 - 7255.40] P:1920.36 E:0.105095 |  About 30 rows back into the cot.
[7255.40 - 7261.40] P:1862.50 E:0.099668 |  I can see down there, a couple of the Liverpool players have got one of those fake Premier League trophies.
[7261.40 - 7264.40] P:1891.42 E:0.098585 |  Ryan Gravenberg has got one in his hands there.
[7264.40 - 7266.40] P:1914.33 E:0.095993 |  Well, they won't get their hands on the rear one for a little while.
[7266.40 - 7270.40] P:2021.42 E:0.097387 |  That'll be the last home game before the end of the season.
[7270.40 - 7275.40] P:1964.94 E:0.094890 |  I can see Trent Alexander-Arnold again right in front of the fans down there.
[7275.40 - 7279.40] P:2041.21 E:0.093969 |  Mo Salah is just standing up on top of the advertising hoarding.
[7279.40 - 7286.40] P:1953.18 E:0.099220 |  And as those fireworks finished, I mean, you don't often see stars on a sunny afternoon,
[7286.40 - 7290.40] P:1812.99 E:0.080291 |  but that's what it looked like as they burst in front of us.
[7290.40 - 7293.40] P:1668.91 E:0.115963 |  And the stars are down on the pitch as well.
[7293.40 - 7298.40] P:1662.93 E:0.097009 |  And now they're being serenaded by the Liverpool supporters.
[7298.40 - 7302.40] P:1766.43 E:0.094695 |  By the way, it has finished in the FA Cup semi-final.
[7302.40 - 7305.40] P:1614.41 E:0.097636 |  Manchester City have beaten Nottingham Forest,
[7305.40 - 7309.40] P:1924.78 E:0.086181 |  Arsenal are four-nil up at Lyon now in the Women's Champions League,
[7309.40 - 7313.40] P:1673.33 E:0.103892 |  and it looks very much like they will be going through.
[7313.40 - 7319.40] P:1486.01 E:0.094829 |  But Anfield is alive, so let's let them sing.
[7328.40 - 7331.40] P:971.90 E:0.107480 |  Oh, Lord,
[7334.40 - 7337.40] P:1231.63 E:0.113118 |  Oh, Lord,
