[0.00 - 2.92] P:1855.83 E:0.008305 |  Roy Hodgson shaking hands with Andrew Apeelo, who's bearded,
[2.92 - 6.84] P:1869.76 E:0.023090 |  has to be said, looks quite magnificent as we go to Ian Dennis.
[6.84 - 8.80] P:1870.78 E:0.025137 |  Touch line in Manaus.
[8.80 - 10.80] P:1831.05 E:0.027227 |  The two teams are in the tunnel.
[10.80 - 14.36] P:1760.72 E:0.027633 |  Andrew Apeelo has shaken hands with Roy Hodgson,
[14.36 - 17.92] P:1686.86 E:0.029771 |  as well as the England captain, Stephen Gerrard.
[17.92 - 21.04] P:1681.57 E:0.032072 |  And he just has a little glance as well to his left at Andrew Apeelo.
[21.04 - 25.00] P:1713.64 E:0.031175 |  I can see that on a giant screen towards the England team.
[25.00 - 26.96] P:1769.57 E:0.030236 |  As Roy Hodgson, the gentleman that he is,
[26.96 - 29.52] P:1803.12 E:0.029092 |  is actually going across the Italian bench
[29.52 - 33.80] P:1706.27 E:0.026970 |  and shaking the hand of every Italian member on that bench.
[33.80 - 37.68] P:1619.53 E:0.027137 |  What was it, 13 years ago, when he left Italian football
[37.68 - 39.80] P:1674.27 E:0.027770 |  and now in his grey suit,
[39.80 - 42.68] P:1786.32 E:0.027976 |  Roy Hodgson has a little glance around the tunnel,
[42.68 - 45.28] P:1820.25 E:0.031718 |  and he will be feeling extremely proud.
[45.28 - 47.96] P:1865.72 E:0.031444 |  Remember when England qualified for the World Cup?
[47.96 - 49.96] P:1864.54 E:0.031742 |  And what an honour.
[49.96 - 52.96] P:1779.17 E:0.031921 |  He will be for him tonight.
[52.96 - 55.40] P:1663.84 E:0.030966 |  He's of course encountered a World Cup
[55.40 - 57.68] P:1613.68 E:0.030837 |  before with Switzerland in 1994,
[57.68 - 61.56] P:1655.89 E:0.030690 |  but this is his first game at the World Cup,
[61.56 - 63.04] P:1663.78 E:0.031010 |  managing your own country.
[63.04 - 65.68] P:1700.27 E:0.028810 |  So a proud moment for Roy Hodgson,
[65.68 - 69.28] P:1550.01 E:0.029550 |  and I'm sure this will be a proud moment too for Stephen Gerrard,
[69.28 - 71.68] P:1625.32 E:0.029345 |  because tonight he joins an elite band of names,
[71.68 - 75.44] P:1699.45 E:0.030028 |  Billy Wright, Bobby Moore and David Beckham.
[75.44 - 77.48] P:1664.86 E:0.031960 |  And now you can add Stephen Gerrard to that list
[77.48 - 81.68] P:1707.77 E:0.032512 |  to leave England in three major tournaments.
[81.68 - 84.00] P:1883.18 E:0.029998 |  The beeper flag is carried out onto the pitch
[84.00 - 87.52] P:1694.92 E:0.031436 |  by some boys and girls wearing bright yellow shirts
[87.52 - 89.44] P:1784.68 E:0.030729 |  and navy blue shorts.
[89.44 - 91.64] P:1717.32 E:0.030128 |  There is the beeper fanfare.
[91.64 - 95.80] P:1831.45 E:0.030773 |  Everybody with their smartphones is trying to capture that moment,
[95.80 - 98.40] P:1769.49 E:0.029944 |  as now the referee will come out.
[98.40 - 102.40] P:1774.91 E:0.030921 |  He'll take the Brazuca ball off the podium and behind him,
[102.40 - 106.32] P:1806.98 E:0.031384 |  Stephen Gerrard and Andrea Perlow lead out England and Italy,
[106.32 - 110.00] P:1866.62 E:0.032335 |  and there is an explosion of noise in the jungle,
[110.00 - 112.00] P:1827.49 E:0.030829 |  live in the house on Five Live.
[115.00 - 117.00] P:1797.13 E:0.029013 |  The England supporters behind me,
[117.00 - 121.00] P:1788.88 E:0.030596 |  two of them have replica World Cup trophies I can make out.
[121.00 - 126.00] P:1771.60 E:0.031307 |  A cuddly Shrek in a miniature wane, Rooney Top.
[126.00 - 130.00] P:1683.39 E:0.030599 |  There are two fans dressed as English Knights.
[130.00 - 132.00] P:1855.92 E:0.030615 |  They must be losing some pounds tonight,
[132.00 - 135.00] P:1767.45 E:0.030831 |  because what is noticeable when I first started talking pitchside,
[135.00 - 136.00] P:1754.44 E:0.026158 |  there was the breeze.
[136.00 - 140.00] P:1663.82 E:0.028884 |  That breeze now is dissipating as we get ready for the National Anthem.
[140.00 - 146.00] P:1625.03 E:0.029980 |  The opening game for England in Group D in the 2014 World Cup.
[170.00 - 174.00] P:1610.36 E:0.033386 |  MUSIC
[195.00 - 198.00] P:1914.02 E:0.030257 |  The National Anthem of Gusto Asti, the England supporters behind me
[198.00 - 200.00] P:1756.60 E:0.030687 |  with their arms and fists clenched.
[200.00 - 204.00] P:1601.11 E:0.031083 |  And now we get ready for the National Anthem of Italy, here in Menace.
[204.00 - 207.00] P:1578.64 E:0.027977 |  MUSIC
[228.00 - 231.00] P:1188.31 E:0.030964 |  MUSIC
[258.00 - 261.00] P:1196.00 E:0.031278 |  MUSIC
[288.00 - 291.00] P:1151.53 E:0.028960 |  MUSIC
[302.00 - 304.00] P:1863.35 E:0.030861 |  The Italian National Anthem,
[304.00 - 307.00] P:1968.87 E:0.030698 |  and in the clear skies of the now above the stadium,
[307.00 - 311.00] P:1976.44 E:0.030475 |  a helicopter hovers as England will now go down the line.
[311.00 - 313.00] P:1893.14 E:0.029797 |  In fact, the Italians will go down the line.
[313.00 - 315.00] P:1790.84 E:0.031363 |  Andrea Perlow leading the Italian team,
[315.00 - 317.00] P:1711.16 E:0.030636 |  shaking the hands of all of the England players.
[317.00 - 320.00] P:1738.05 E:0.030087 |  Before the England National Anthem, I noticed that Daniel Sturridge
[320.00 - 323.00] P:1828.86 E:0.030975 |  had a bottle of water, and he just poured it over his face.
[323.00 - 327.00] P:1800.57 E:0.030691 |  Because what is interesting is that breeze has disappeared,
[327.00 - 329.00] P:1577.82 E:0.029210 |  that was maybe here 45 minutes ago.
[329.00 - 332.00] P:1608.56 E:0.029014 |  Speaking to Stephen Gerrard, and we've spoken on many times,
[332.00 - 337.00] P:1663.62 E:0.028025 |  whether it be in Portugal, Miami, or indeed Rio and Menace,
[337.00 - 340.00] P:1688.26 E:0.028295 |  he said, we've talked the talk, now we've got to walk the walk.
[340.00 - 343.00] P:1731.74 E:0.027455 |  The England players posed for their team photo.
[343.00 - 346.00] P:1715.42 E:0.028238 |  Everybody can remember Bloom Fontaine and four years ago
[346.00 - 349.00] P:1709.17 E:0.026995 |  and how they capitulated against Germany.
[349.00 - 352.00] P:1718.87 E:0.029678 |  England have an excellent record in opening games in a World Cup.
[352.00 - 355.00] P:1790.22 E:0.029374 |  They haven't been beaten since 1986.
[355.00 - 358.00] P:1833.95 E:0.030323 |  How will they fare in their opening game in Group D?
[358.00 - 362.00] P:1824.60 E:0.030269 |  Pitch side in Menace on five-life, but very soon you'll hear the commentary team
[362.00 - 365.00] P:1814.67 E:0.029132 |  of Mike Ingram, Danny Mills and Alan Green.
[365.00 - 369.00] P:1832.60 E:0.027885 |  As Johart wonders over and gives the thumbs up to the England supporters.
[369.00 - 371.00] P:1664.13 E:0.028460 |  Just a quick final one from Chris Waddle.
[371.00 - 374.00] P:1575.72 E:0.028696 |  Chris is like an experienced, like no other, is it?
[374.00 - 377.00] P:1686.30 E:0.024844 |  How much football you play, you're playing for your country in a World Cup?
[377.00 - 380.00] P:1775.25 E:0.025238 |  I just hope they play the instructions they enjoy, they relax,
[380.00 - 383.00] P:1690.21 E:0.024532 |  and they play at the tempo which the Italians will not enjoy,
[383.00 - 386.00] P:1670.66 E:0.022096 |  but keep the ball a lot better than we normally do.
[386.00 - 389.00] P:1758.19 E:0.027053 |  Chris and I'll take your calls after the full-time whistle.
[389.00 - 392.00] P:1723.08 E:0.025388 |  0-500-909-693-85058 on the text,
[392.00 - 397.00] P:1742.12 E:0.025939 |  at BBC Five Live on social media and use the hashtag BBC World Cup.
[397.00 - 402.00] P:1762.88 E:0.027100 |  This is it, then England underway, live on five-life from Menace,
[402.00 - 406.00] P:1741.46 E:0.026054 |  with Danny Mills, Mike Ingram and Alan Green, your commentary team.
[406.00 - 411.00] P:1735.22 E:0.024628 |  So Brazil came from behind to win their opening game.
[411.00 - 415.00] P:1783.74 E:0.024602 |  Then we had Spain, the World Champions, thrashed by Holland.
[415.00 - 417.00] P:1810.20 E:0.024518 |  Today, arguably an even bigger upset,
[417.00 - 420.00] P:1885.41 E:0.023476 |  Uruguay losing to Costa Rica.
[420.00 - 425.00] P:1792.03 E:0.023754 |  But for most of you listening to Five Live, this is where the World Cup begins.
[425.00 - 428.00] P:1802.30 E:0.025561 |  England relatively unburdened by expectation,
[428.00 - 431.00] P:1543.41 E:0.025658 |  more cubs than lions in the starting 11,
[431.00 - 434.00] P:1770.01 E:0.024844 |  fresh faces, exciting players, we hope.
[434.00 - 436.00] P:1876.99 E:0.021653 |  This is the starting 11.
[436.00 - 440.00] P:1868.10 E:0.022988 |  Goalkeeper Hart defends Johnson, Cahill, Jaguil and Bangs,
[440.00 - 444.00] P:1767.91 E:0.024252 |  then Gerard and Henderson, Sterling, Rooney and Wellbeck,
[444.00 - 446.00] P:1901.54 E:0.022205 |  and finally, Sturridge.
[446.00 - 448.00] P:1814.02 E:0.023591 |  Entirely without goalkeeper and captain Poupon,
[448.00 - 452.00] P:1806.59 E:0.021914 |  replaced by Syragoo, their defense, Damian, Paletta,
[452.00 - 456.00] P:1757.49 E:0.023183 |  Barzagli and Chiellini, then Marquisio,
[456.00 - 458.00] P:1834.64 E:0.025632 |  Pirlo, the key man and captain tonight,
[458.00 - 462.00] P:1784.82 E:0.023606 |  and De Rossi, then Verati, Balotelli and Candreva.
[462.00 - 464.00] P:1960.50 E:0.019787 |  The officials are Dutch.
[464.00 - 466.00] P:1852.97 E:0.022704 |  We've got, in referee, Björn Kipers,
[466.00 - 470.00] P:1895.22 E:0.024072 |  easily one of the best referees in the world of football.
[470.00 - 475.00] P:1917.56 E:0.022510 |  He's just checking, as always, in these penultimate seconds
[475.00 - 479.00] P:1754.45 E:0.022799 |  before kickoff, which I think we've got a few remaining,
[479.00 - 483.00] P:1761.71 E:0.023106 |  television all around the globe will want their advertising
[483.00 - 487.00] P:1921.57 E:0.022387 |  finished and get ready for the start of this game.
[487.00 - 489.00] P:1831.77 E:0.024080 |  Your thoughts, Danny? Final thoughts for four kickoff.
[489.00 - 491.00] P:1962.14 E:0.023700 |  Well, just looking very, very quickly,
[491.00 - 493.00] P:1853.92 E:0.024928 |  the formation's very, very interesting.
[493.00 - 495.00] P:1934.28 E:0.022696 |  Wayne Rooney has gone to the left-hand side,
[495.00 - 497.00] P:1761.17 E:0.024543 |  looks indeed that Sterling is going to play
[497.00 - 499.00] P:1717.24 E:0.023800 |  in that number 10 role off Daniel Sturridge.
[499.00 - 502.00] P:1803.73 E:0.023489 |  Pirlo looks like he may play further forward,
[502.00 - 504.00] P:1833.45 E:0.028170 |  with De Rossi being the holding player.
[504.00 - 507.00] P:2063.09 E:0.026552 |  England's World Cup is underway.
[507.00 - 512.00] P:1943.92 E:0.022750 |  Italy dressed in blue, England all in white.
[512.00 - 515.00] P:1814.59 E:0.024677 |  They'll save those red shirts for when they're absolutely necessary.
[515.00 - 517.00] P:1802.80 E:0.023825 |  Thank you very much indeed.
[517.00 - 521.00] P:1918.04 E:0.025157 |  Italy in possession at the moment with De Rossi.
[521.00 - 524.00] P:1881.34 E:0.025778 |  And looking for movement down the right-hand side.
[524.00 - 526.00] P:1759.30 E:0.024898 |  It'll be interesting to see how the high temperature
[526.00 - 528.00] P:1857.60 E:0.023678 |  affects the pace of play.
[528.00 - 530.00] P:1835.30 E:0.023863 |  It's hit long towards Balotelli.
[530.00 - 532.00] P:1863.37 E:0.017320 |  A cross came Gary Cahill,
[532.00 - 534.00] P:1783.16 E:0.025967 |  and Cahill puts it out of play
[534.00 - 537.00] P:1836.88 E:0.025483 |  for a throw into Italy, deep inside the England half.
[537.00 - 539.00] P:1826.91 E:0.021041 |  Italy playing from right to left,
[539.00 - 541.00] P:1827.98 E:0.021244 |  as we look out from our high commentary position,
[541.00 - 544.00] P:1815.34 E:0.023729 |  but it's beautifully centred over the halfway line.
[544.00 - 546.00] P:1823.83 E:0.024509 |  Pirlo chipped the ball down the right-hand side,
[546.00 - 550.00] P:1806.25 E:0.021052 |  slightly ahead of his target, and it's behind for a goal kick.
[550.00 - 555.00] P:1841.73 E:0.022391 |  Just to confirm those slight changes that maybe we expected.
[555.00 - 558.00] P:1708.48 E:0.024959 |  De Rossi is going to be the holding player for Italy.
[558.00 - 561.00] P:1827.11 E:0.022263 |  In front of that is a four-man midfield
[561.00 - 565.00] P:1672.28 E:0.023942 |  with Pirlo, Verrati, Marquisio and Candreva.
[565.00 - 567.00] P:1786.37 E:0.027383 |  At England, Wayne Rooney playing on the left-hand side.
[567.00 - 570.00] P:1790.71 E:0.025612 |  It's Raheem Sterling playing off Daniel Sturridge,
[570.00 - 573.00] P:1844.70 E:0.027088 |  although it does look like Sterling Rooney in particular
[573.00 - 575.00] P:1793.19 E:0.024380 |  are going to move round.
[575.00 - 579.00] P:1862.43 E:0.024940 |  They are. I mean, currently, Welbeck was playing behind Sturridge.
[579.00 - 583.00] P:1822.87 E:0.025351 |  It's just flexibility, fluidity in that front four for Inge.
[583.00 - 586.00] P:1965.93 E:0.027730 |  They lose the ball, and then that foot was slightly high
[586.00 - 590.00] P:1800.23 E:0.022353 |  by Johnson on Chiellini, and I think it's a free kick to Italy.
[590.00 - 593.00] P:1755.95 E:0.021339 |  Chiellini looked at Johnson, but what does he expect?
[593.00 - 595.00] P:1679.55 E:0.024045 |  It's an early challenge in a World Cup game,
[595.00 - 597.00] P:1813.91 E:0.022845 |  and it's a free kick to Italy.
[597.00 - 600.00] P:1717.70 E:0.025106 |  The stadium isn't full. The Arena, Amazonia,
[600.00 - 603.00] P:1704.15 E:0.022794 |  it holds allegedly around 40,000.
[603.00 - 606.00] P:1793.16 E:0.020728 |  There's going to be a grotesque white elephant after the World Cup
[606.00 - 610.00] P:1733.27 E:0.021832 |  because there isn't a club, a football club in this city
[610.00 - 612.00] P:1664.60 E:0.022140 |  capable of filling it.
[612.00 - 614.00] P:1832.22 E:0.022286 |  But there you go. That's what happens to countries
[614.00 - 616.00] P:1807.77 E:0.026278 |  when they stage a World Cup.
[616.00 - 618.00] P:1712.81 E:0.025245 |  It happened in South Africa as well.
[618.00 - 621.00] P:1724.10 E:0.021432 |  No doubt it will happen markedly in Qatar
[621.00 - 624.00] P:1703.46 E:0.021464 |  if it ever gets to Qatar in eight years' time.
[624.00 - 626.00] P:1758.82 E:0.024825 |  We concentrate on Brazil 2014.
[626.00 - 629.00] P:1812.83 E:0.024348 |  Five live-year stations to listen to everything that matters
[629.00 - 631.00] P:1803.66 E:0.027008 |  in the World Cup. England with a throwing.
[631.00 - 634.00] P:1840.53 E:0.027122 |  Johnson will take it short of the halfway line.
[634.00 - 638.00] P:1937.76 E:0.025868 |  He throws it towards Sturridge, that cleared by Italy.
[638.00 - 641.00] P:1752.69 E:0.024127 |  Perleau got a nudge in the back there from Jordan Henderson,
[641.00 - 645.00] P:1824.10 E:0.021456 |  but it's back now to Paletta, and Paletta finds Bersagli.
[645.00 - 648.00] P:1879.64 E:0.025281 |  Bersagli to Paletta once more.
[648.00 - 653.00] P:1845.11 E:0.022298 |  Midway inside his own half on De Peerle.
[653.00 - 655.00] P:1749.01 E:0.026274 |  No one obviously at the moment is picking up Perleau,
[655.00 - 658.00] P:1915.23 E:0.027315 |  and maybe they should be after a glorious pass like that.
[658.00 - 661.00] P:1823.89 E:0.026393 |  Forward to Marquisio, wide to the far side of the field.
[661.00 - 663.00] P:1831.34 E:0.028285 |  Ball played into the six-yard box for England,
[663.00 - 665.00] P:1821.58 E:0.025641 |  and it's cleared by Phil Jagielka.
[665.00 - 668.00] P:1817.20 E:0.023541 |  How to play on the far side for a throw-in to Italy.
[668.00 - 672.00] P:1756.43 E:0.024219 |  Andreva, who is genuinely a winger for club and country,
[672.00 - 676.00] P:1796.02 E:0.020708 |  takes the throw-in and throws it back to De Rossi.
[676.00 - 679.00] P:1633.07 E:0.024197 |  De Rossi looking for Andreva once more, then he was marked,
[679.00 - 682.00] P:1677.66 E:0.025092 |  so he turns and plays it back to the halfway line.
[682.00 - 684.00] P:1659.07 E:0.024185 |  Now it's taken up by Perleau.
[684.00 - 686.00] P:1731.87 E:0.025560 |  Perleau forward to Marquisio.
[686.00 - 688.00] P:1799.88 E:0.024702 |  Marquisio's pass was loose, and England cleared,
[688.00 - 690.00] P:1766.99 E:0.024710 |  and here's Sturridge into Sturling,
[690.00 - 692.00] P:1710.00 E:0.028266 |  running the good run through the inside left position,
[692.00 - 694.00] P:1806.51 E:0.027631 |  well back to his left as well.
[694.00 - 696.00] P:1853.16 E:0.027905 |  Sturling doesn't need him at the moment,
[696.00 - 698.00] P:1985.08 E:0.028615 |  then he shoots from long range, good discreetes.
[698.00 - 700.00] P:1884.61 E:0.026632 |  I thought that was into that initially,
[700.00 - 702.00] P:1832.77 E:0.026157 |  but it was just a noptical illusion,
[702.00 - 705.00] P:1826.23 E:0.026030 |  as the ball crashed into the side netting.
[705.00 - 708.00] P:1848.19 E:0.025457 |  I didn't think the goalkeeper delivered it, did it go?
[708.00 - 710.00] P:1871.56 E:0.026359 |  Very, very positive from Maheem Sturling.
[710.00 - 712.00] P:1848.35 E:0.024742 |  A great start.
[712.00 - 714.00] P:1773.16 E:0.027527 |  Alan almost getting very, very excited.
[714.00 - 716.00] P:1813.71 E:0.025015 |  Almost, almost. The ball from the angle,
[716.00 - 718.00] P:1814.91 E:0.022489 |  hit the side netting,
[718.00 - 720.00] P:1830.40 E:0.023362 |  it looks from some angle surely,
[720.00 - 723.00] P:1833.41 E:0.026243 |  but it might have just sneaked into the top corner.
[723.00 - 726.00] P:1833.34 E:0.023123 |  But a great start from Maheem Sturling.
[726.00 - 728.00] P:1755.35 E:0.025486 |  Got the ball and ran it, people,
[728.00 - 730.00] P:1775.56 E:0.025144 |  and that's why we wanted him in the side.
[730.00 - 732.00] P:1573.96 E:0.025266 |  I remember many years ago at Anfield,
[732.00 - 734.00] P:1773.33 E:0.022440 |  the in-rush shot,
[734.00 - 736.00] P:1829.27 E:0.021985 |  and the ball actually hit
[736.00 - 738.00] P:1749.66 E:0.026975 |  an advertisement holding behind the goal,
[738.00 - 740.00] P:1830.60 E:0.026920 |  but it flew so quickly past the goalkeeper.
[740.00 - 742.00] P:1762.19 E:0.024455 |  It seemed to nestle in the back of the net,
[742.00 - 745.00] P:1687.54 E:0.023381 |  but I was the only one at Anfield who thought it was a goal.
[745.00 - 747.00] P:1774.98 E:0.022228 |  Jimmy Anfield very quietly said,
[747.00 - 749.00] P:1697.94 E:0.020030 |  it's not a goal either.
[749.00 - 751.00] P:1808.26 E:0.021608 |  Now, there was that from Sturling,
[751.00 - 753.00] P:1808.42 E:0.022075 |  but it was a flash
[753.00 - 755.00] P:1705.47 E:0.022283 |  from the 19-year-old from Liverpool.
[755.00 - 757.00] P:1680.03 E:0.026733 |  One of five Liverpool players
[757.00 - 759.00] P:1842.02 E:0.023515 |  in this England starting 11,
[759.00 - 761.00] P:1773.48 E:0.025365 |  two from Everton, two from Manchester United,
[761.00 - 764.00] P:1729.75 E:0.024674 |  one from Manchester City, Joe Hart, that's the goalkeeper,
[764.00 - 766.00] P:1757.98 E:0.023172 |  and then, of course, Gary Cahill,
[766.00 - 769.00] P:1731.91 E:0.024887 |  the lone representative from outside the north-west.
[769.00 - 772.00] P:1792.61 E:0.027519 |  That's true from Kialini, giving the ball away to Welbeck.
[772.00 - 775.00] P:1805.46 E:0.025816 |  Welbeck's first touch, not great, though he has one to throw in.
[775.00 - 778.00] P:1900.04 E:0.026770 |  Midway inside the Italian half, near side of the field.
[778.00 - 780.00] P:1888.70 E:0.021752 |  Johnson's going to take it.
[780.00 - 785.00] P:1727.87 E:0.020763 |  Now, Rooney is up in the D of the Italian penalty.
[785.00 - 787.00] P:1779.94 E:0.022453 |  The throw goes to Sturridge.
[787.00 - 789.00] P:1795.62 E:0.024045 |  Sturridge controls it well, passes it back to Welbeck.
[789.00 - 791.00] P:1727.25 E:0.023673 |  Welbeck into Sturling,
[791.00 - 793.00] P:1827.07 E:0.025441 |  into the penalty, tried to beat a defender.
[793.00 - 796.00] P:1929.09 E:0.027221 |  Ball rebounds to Henderson, and the shot is saved by the goalkeeper.
[796.00 - 799.00] P:1879.02 E:0.026916 |  Still in play, near side of the field.
[799.00 - 801.00] P:1892.86 E:0.023610 |  Sturridge, right of the penalty area.
[801.00 - 804.00] P:1833.23 E:0.024333 |  Sturridge checks onto his left foot, onto his right foot,
[804.00 - 806.00] P:1708.24 E:0.024644 |  teasing the defender one way or the other,
[806.00 - 808.00] P:1802.42 E:0.025630 |  chips it into the near post.
[808.00 - 812.00] P:1854.28 E:0.026096 |  Good run by Welbeck, a trick to backheal the ball to Sturridge.
[812.00 - 814.00] P:1832.53 E:0.023728 |  It's cleared by Italy who made the interception
[814.00 - 817.00] P:1755.75 E:0.024230 |  and looked how deep Ballotelli is.
[817.00 - 820.00] P:1704.23 E:0.024977 |  Near side of the field, halfway inside his own half.
[820.00 - 822.00] P:1860.24 E:0.028858 |  Plays it back to Marchesio.
[822.00 - 824.00] P:1967.47 E:0.026448 |  It's a good ball by Marchesio to the far side.
[824.00 - 827.00] P:1960.21 E:0.025624 |  And Darnie, over the halfway line.
[827.00 - 831.00] P:1881.21 E:0.020298 |  Now, Italy attack with Kendrava.
[831.00 - 834.00] P:1750.16 E:0.025725 |  Left over the edge of the England penalty area.
[834.00 - 837.00] P:1781.32 E:0.021892 |  Quite a bright start to the game, particularly for England,
[837.00 - 841.00] P:1739.52 E:0.022512 |  two enterprising shots and goal from Sturling and then Henderson.
[841.00 - 843.00] P:1697.46 E:0.026750 |  Now, Pirlo flicks the ball forward,
[843.00 - 846.00] P:1864.67 E:0.025985 |  but Ballotelli had retreated rather than going forward,
[846.00 - 848.00] P:1789.82 E:0.022581 |  and the ball bounces through to Johar.
[848.00 - 850.00] P:1791.35 E:0.023615 |  Really good start from England.
[850.00 - 853.00] P:1904.42 E:0.025106 |  Raheem Sturling has been evolving in the best two moves so far.
[853.00 - 857.00] P:1815.02 E:0.022605 |  His shot into the side netting, and then a jinking little run.
[857.00 - 860.00] P:1768.53 E:0.023147 |  Came back to Henderson, hit it. Another very, very good strike.
[860.00 - 864.00] P:1744.17 E:0.021874 |  Syragou, well, a good save low to his left-hand side,
[864.00 - 867.00] P:1738.32 E:0.024708 |  and that'll do him a good job in terms of confidence.
[867.00 - 870.00] P:1755.06 E:0.019036 |  But England started very, very brightly.
[870.00 - 873.00] P:1694.73 E:0.023075 |  Here's Damien on the far side of the field.
[873.00 - 875.00] P:1679.88 E:0.025687 |  He's another Bressetel defender for Italy.
[875.00 - 877.00] P:1713.94 E:0.022275 |  He's played right back, he's played left back.
[877.00 - 879.00] P:1681.94 E:0.022385 |  He's a good defense for his club, Torino.
[879.00 - 882.00] P:1703.64 E:0.020365 |  Tonight, he's at right back for his country.
[882.00 - 885.00] P:1629.60 E:0.024462 |  And it's near side of the field.
[885.00 - 888.00] P:1727.12 E:0.024079 |  Italy in possession.
[888.00 - 890.00] P:1697.14 E:0.026657 |  Back to Boisagli.
[890.00 - 892.00] P:1801.41 E:0.020320 |  And on to Verati,
[892.00 - 897.00] P:1712.31 E:0.023781 |  of whom Gianluca Viali was speaking so effusively before kickoff.
[897.00 - 900.00] P:1650.29 E:0.023500 |  On to Cendreva, just over the half-way line.
[900.00 - 902.00] P:1759.34 E:0.017249 |  Back to De Rossi.
[902.00 - 904.00] P:1630.73 E:0.026152 |  De Rossi available again.
[904.00 - 906.00] P:1672.55 E:0.025088 |  And now Pirlo, almost standing on the centre spot.
[906.00 - 908.00] P:1819.61 E:0.020875 |  To De Rossi.
[908.00 - 911.00] P:1731.46 E:0.024349 |  Italy patient. This is what we expect from them.
[911.00 - 913.00] P:1705.76 E:0.028279 |  They don't always start World Cup as well.
[913.00 - 915.00] P:1816.97 E:0.026221 |  In fact, they started four years ago
[915.00 - 917.00] P:1772.87 E:0.026132 |  absolutely abysmally as World Cup holders
[917.00 - 920.00] P:1663.84 E:0.024590 |  and went out of the group stage in South Africa.
[920.00 - 923.00] P:1829.05 E:0.025784 |  Here's Balotelli, inside right channel for Italy.
[923.00 - 925.00] P:1808.61 E:0.023949 |  Balotelli, back to Pirlo.
[925.00 - 927.00] P:1743.31 E:0.023749 |  And De Rossi wants more.
[927.00 - 930.00] P:1639.49 E:0.024665 |  Verati makes himself available deeper than De Rossi.
[930.00 - 932.00] P:1768.71 E:0.027528 |  The pass is inside though to Marquisio.
[932.00 - 934.00] P:1785.88 E:0.024694 |  Marquisio inside left channel.
[934.00 - 937.00] P:1743.50 E:0.025608 |  On to Chiellini, up towards the England penalty area.
[937.00 - 939.00] P:1838.02 E:0.028011 |  Chiellini presses in low.
[939.00 - 941.00] P:1973.39 E:0.028662 |  Good dummy by Pirlo.
[941.00 - 943.00] P:1888.71 E:0.025519 |  Pirlo lets the ball run.
[943.00 - 945.00] P:1726.81 E:0.027959 |  No attempted shot and goal, not at the moment.
[945.00 - 947.00] P:1859.83 E:0.023776 |  Verati.
[947.00 - 949.00] P:1799.32 E:0.023188 |  Good spell of possession this for Middley.
[949.00 - 951.00] P:1811.00 E:0.027440 |  Then it's flicked into the England penalty area.
[951.00 - 953.00] P:1793.58 E:0.026899 |  Gary Cahill heads it away, drops to Pirlo.
[953.00 - 955.00] P:1812.05 E:0.028764 |  Pirlo runs into the box, appeals for handball,
[955.00 - 958.00] P:1841.79 E:0.027029 |  and then there was a shot wide by Chiellini.
[958.00 - 960.00] P:1821.61 E:0.026975 |  They're all appealing to the Dutch referee.
[960.00 - 963.00] P:1797.45 E:0.024399 |  There was an England hand on the ball inside the penalty area,
[963.00 - 965.00] P:1743.75 E:0.023149 |  and the referee ignores it.
[965.00 - 967.00] P:1747.62 E:0.026796 |  Well, Pirlo played a lot further forward
[967.00 - 969.00] P:1852.45 E:0.022703 |  than we may be expected.
[969.00 - 972.00] P:1742.38 E:0.023392 |  Just tried to dink the ball over Glenn Johnson.
[972.00 - 974.00] P:1898.57 E:0.024109 |  Glenn Johnson, hand right by his side.
[974.00 - 976.00] P:1799.30 E:0.022553 |  Yes, it did hit him on the arm.
[976.00 - 978.00] P:1735.50 E:0.023631 |  Nothing he could do from that range.
[978.00 - 980.00] P:1701.99 E:0.023133 |  And now a really good game so far.
[980.00 - 984.00] P:1739.31 E:0.021551 |  The England, almost playing on the counterattack, if you like.
[984.00 - 986.00] P:1715.38 E:0.023403 |  You know, we know they have that pace and storage
[986.00 - 988.00] P:1664.79 E:0.021787 |  and Raheem Sterling.
[988.00 - 990.00] P:1564.65 E:0.023817 |  England having to key in seed.
[990.00 - 992.00] P:1708.37 E:0.023696 |  A little bit too much of possession.
[992.00 - 994.00] P:1696.14 E:0.025310 |  They've got to be wary in the final third.
[994.00 - 996.00] P:1620.42 E:0.026680 |  You know, when Pirlo and Raheem get on the ball,
[996.00 - 998.00] P:1637.60 E:0.024163 |  they're looking for those little slide rule passes
[998.00 - 1000.00] P:1581.16 E:0.025167 |  or dinks over the top.
[1000.00 - 1002.00] P:1709.42 E:0.025227 |  Eight minutes gone in Manaus.
[1002.00 - 1004.00] P:1763.16 E:0.024062 |  England nearly listening to five-life,
[1004.00 - 1008.00] P:1803.06 E:0.023931 |  your World Cup station of Brazil, 2014.
[1008.00 - 1010.00] P:1690.12 E:0.022114 |  Italy have nice settled.
[1010.00 - 1013.00] P:1872.57 E:0.027088 |  De Rossi sliced the ball through,
[1013.00 - 1016.00] P:1901.14 E:0.027425 |  played on to the far side by Condrava,
[1016.00 - 1018.00] P:1674.24 E:0.028012 |  cost into the England penalty area,
[1018.00 - 1020.00] P:1852.99 E:0.024989 |  lifts in the air, I think off a defender,
[1020.00 - 1023.00] P:1903.70 E:0.023447 |  into the safe hands of Joe Hart.
[1023.00 - 1026.00] P:1854.76 E:0.021600 |  Joe Hart is sweating profusely
[1026.00 - 1029.00] P:1780.10 E:0.025128 |  according to Ian Dennis in the warm-up.
[1029.00 - 1031.00] P:1918.94 E:0.025862 |  Decline to wash his hair.
[1031.00 - 1033.00] P:1974.06 E:0.027192 |  Leaves that for the ads.
[1033.00 - 1036.00] P:1976.30 E:0.026987 |  Great ball by Rooney to the near side.
[1036.00 - 1039.00] P:1866.53 E:0.026491 |  England right. Good control by his club colleague,
[1039.00 - 1041.00] P:1826.73 E:0.021852 |  Danny Welbacke.
[1041.00 - 1043.00] P:1753.08 E:0.024866 |  Now taken up by Daniel Sturridge.
[1043.00 - 1045.00] P:1717.35 E:0.027059 |  Glenn Johnson to his right. Played forward to Johnson.
[1045.00 - 1047.00] P:1794.47 E:0.026912 |  Burnley crossed into the penalty area.
[1047.00 - 1049.00] P:1839.34 E:0.026606 |  He's got it in the back of the net.
[1049.00 - 1051.00] P:1871.73 E:0.025115 |  The ball goes back,
[1051.00 - 1053.00] P:1778.04 E:0.022169 |  and a good catch from the defender.
[1053.00 - 1055.00] P:1702.57 E:0.023682 |  OK, that was a bit too high for Welbacke.
[1055.00 - 1057.00] P:1832.30 E:0.019448 |  But by Citigroup the goalkeeper,
[1057.00 - 1059.00] P:1722.07 E:0.025614 |  and immediately thrown out to Pirlo.
[1059.00 - 1061.00] P:1719.78 E:0.020340 |  Decent ball in from Glenn Johnson on the right-hand side.
[1061.00 - 1063.00] P:1718.28 E:0.024467 |  As you said, just a little bit too high,
[1063.00 - 1065.00] P:1674.96 E:0.022430 |  and Citigroup came with an easy catch.
[1065.00 - 1066.00] P:1626.04 E:0.026721 |  A very open game so far.
[1066.00 - 1068.00] P:1727.97 E:0.022762 |  I think so far this World Cup
[1068.00 - 1070.00] P:1607.22 E:0.023144 |  we're all a bit surprised at how teams have started,
[1070.00 - 1072.00] P:1712.13 E:0.027264 |  and maybe attacked more than they would normally.
[1072.00 - 1074.00] P:1761.97 E:0.020555 |  Remember, we haven't had a draw yet so far
[1074.00 - 1076.00] P:1679.17 E:0.019222 |  so far in the tournament.
[1076.00 - 1078.00] P:1653.04 E:0.026468 |  When this draw was made,
[1078.00 - 1080.00] P:1755.53 E:0.022128 |  England, Italy and Manass,
[1080.00 - 1082.00] P:1698.53 E:0.024200 |  the first of England's games in the group,
[1082.00 - 1084.00] P:1733.49 E:0.025708 |  it looked nailed on to be nil-nil.
[1084.00 - 1086.00] P:1818.17 E:0.020584 |  But it's an enterprising start from both teams.
[1086.00 - 1088.00] P:1673.93 E:0.023558 |  Here's Verati.
[1088.00 - 1090.00] P:1527.37 E:0.027104 |  A little deeper than we expected him to play.
[1090.00 - 1093.00] P:1643.42 E:0.024929 |  Te Chiellini, offering it left back tonight.
[1093.00 - 1095.00] P:1717.98 E:0.023792 |  Into Paletto or Parma.
[1095.00 - 1098.00] P:1785.93 E:0.024383 |  And onto Barzagli of the Champions Juventus.
[1098.00 - 1100.00] P:1845.78 E:0.028089 |  De Rossi of Roma.
[1100.00 - 1102.00] P:1920.98 E:0.027113 |  And there Verati once more.
[1102.00 - 1104.00] P:1964.59 E:0.028357 |  Like the goalkeeper, Syragri,
[1104.00 - 1107.00] P:1916.25 E:0.027217 |  plays in France now for Panissan Germain.
[1107.00 - 1109.00] P:1937.04 E:0.026048 |  Back to De Rossi.
[1109.00 - 1111.00] P:1727.38 E:0.025673 |  And England relatively happy at the moment.
[1111.00 - 1113.00] P:1729.02 E:0.026093 |  The Italy of the possession, particularly when
[1113.00 - 1117.00] P:1738.93 E:0.025408 |  Pirlo overheats the pass straight through to Joe Hart.
[1117.00 - 1119.00] P:1764.36 E:0.025079 |  Hart throws out to the far side,
[1119.00 - 1121.00] P:1703.47 E:0.020175 |  and it's with Leighton Banks.
[1121.00 - 1123.00] P:1644.68 E:0.024698 |  Onto Wayne Rooney.
[1123.00 - 1125.00] P:1665.22 E:0.025754 |  Rooney leads it to the skipper Gerard.
[1125.00 - 1128.00] P:1780.26 E:0.026550 |  And into Jordan Henderson inside the centre circle.
[1128.00 - 1130.00] P:1828.20 E:0.027375 |  Onto the nearside.
[1130.00 - 1133.00] P:1898.32 E:0.024811 |  Cesare Fran Deli, evident in the set-nicholary at the moment.
[1134.00 - 1136.00] P:1865.52 E:0.023100 |  No sign of Roy Hodgson.
[1136.00 - 1139.00] P:1828.07 E:0.024778 |  Here's Danny Welving, approaching the Italian penalty area.
[1139.00 - 1141.00] P:1772.29 E:0.021469 |  Plays it wide to Sturridge.
[1141.00 - 1143.00] P:1737.32 E:0.025417 |  Once more, you see the fluidity of those
[1143.00 - 1145.00] P:1857.89 E:0.024712 |  front-four players for Ingram.
[1145.00 - 1147.00] P:1791.21 E:0.025719 |  Now it's with Gerard.
[1147.00 - 1149.00] P:1671.35 E:0.022201 |  To Baines in the far side of the field.
[1149.00 - 1151.00] P:1719.93 E:0.025441 |  Baines in now to Raheem Sturring.
[1151.00 - 1153.00] P:1761.57 E:0.028058 |  Sturring looking for a 1-2.
[1153.00 - 1155.00] P:1809.73 E:0.026995 |  Didn't quite come off.
[1155.00 - 1157.00] P:1775.32 E:0.027123 |  Rooney still might win the ball for Ingram.
[1157.00 - 1159.00] P:1862.41 E:0.028317 |  Didn't quite do so.
[1159.00 - 1161.00] P:1870.85 E:0.027201 |  Italy care, then they give it away.
[1161.00 - 1163.00] P:1950.68 E:0.023995 |  Shot by Welving.
[1163.00 - 1165.00] P:1874.58 E:0.028176 |  It's Paletta that gave the ball away unnecessarily.
[1165.00 - 1167.00] P:1955.22 E:0.023869 |  Straight into Danny Welving's feet.
[1167.00 - 1169.00] P:1791.33 E:0.022427 |  25 yards from goal.
[1169.00 - 1171.00] P:1819.25 E:0.022811 |  Good touch.
[1171.00 - 1173.00] P:1815.54 E:0.022491 |  Didn't quite catch it cleanly.
[1173.00 - 1175.00] P:1829.24 E:0.023853 |  Just dragged it across the face of goal.
[1175.00 - 1177.00] P:1711.65 E:0.024692 |  They're in positive from England.
[1177.00 - 1179.00] P:1714.13 E:0.020342 |  They're working the Italians very, very hard.
[1179.00 - 1181.00] P:1781.68 E:0.019499 |  From the goal kick, which was taken short by
[1181.00 - 1183.00] P:1822.45 E:0.022024 |  Italy, it's with
[1183.00 - 1185.00] P:1817.84 E:0.018863 |  De Rossi.
[1185.00 - 1187.00] P:1784.22 E:0.026805 |  De Rossi, who's deeper than Perlo
[1187.00 - 1189.00] P:1862.42 E:0.018572 |  so far in the game.
[1189.00 - 1191.00] P:1788.49 E:0.023342 |  Good ball towards a colleague in the halfway line.
[1191.00 - 1193.00] P:1726.53 E:0.020317 |  Clicked on to Chiellini over the halfway line.
[1193.00 - 1195.00] P:1623.75 E:0.022978 |  The left back.
[1195.00 - 1197.00] P:1755.49 E:0.023129 |  That was a hard pass in to Balotelli.
[1197.00 - 1199.00] P:1781.45 E:0.024096 |  Balotelli made something of it.
[1199.00 - 1201.00] P:1711.02 E:0.021701 |  And Verati collects it.
[1201.00 - 1203.00] P:1710.41 E:0.021868 |  Now to De Rossi again.
[1203.00 - 1205.00] P:1657.33 E:0.025475 |  Man free in the far side of the field.
[1205.00 - 1207.00] P:1750.43 E:0.024461 |  That's Darmien the right fullback, but he's ignored.
[1207.00 - 1209.00] P:1909.72 E:0.022080 |  It's played to the left side for Italy.
[1209.00 - 1211.00] P:1877.29 E:0.026781 |  Chiellini into Perlo.
[1211.00 - 1213.00] P:1776.26 E:0.026027 |  Just signed a new two-year contract with his club.
[1213.00 - 1215.00] P:1794.77 E:0.027030 |  At 35 years of age.
[1215.00 - 1217.00] P:1826.93 E:0.025643 |  Outstanding under Perlo.
[1217.00 - 1219.00] P:1898.76 E:0.020605 |  Perlo.
[1219.00 - 1221.00] P:1761.24 E:0.023570 |  He's in the lead.
[1221.00 - 1223.00] P:1682.11 E:0.024551 |  And then leaves it.
[1223.00 - 1225.00] P:1792.05 E:0.021540 |  And on the goes to the far side of the field.
[1225.00 - 1227.00] P:1861.45 E:0.027214 |  To Darmien.
[1227.00 - 1229.00] P:1948.09 E:0.029422 |  Darmien.
[1229.00 - 1231.00] P:1915.69 E:0.027686 |  Into Darmien once more.
[1231.00 - 1233.00] P:1802.63 E:0.027036 |  Very, very patient.
[1233.00 - 1235.00] P:1842.91 E:0.022367 |  De Rossi.
[1235.00 - 1237.00] P:1820.21 E:0.025536 |  That's a good ball to the left side.
[1237.00 - 1239.00] P:1763.46 E:0.025023 |  Chiellini relatively on mark.
[1239.00 - 1241.00] P:1728.46 E:0.023289 |  Chiellini into Marquezio.
[1241.00 - 1243.00] P:1740.25 E:0.021671 |  Perlo once more.
[1243.00 - 1245.00] P:1826.95 E:0.021818 |  Perlo's looking to Darmien towards the far side.
[1245.00 - 1247.00] P:1695.59 E:0.019141 |  Plays it accurately.
[1247.00 - 1249.00] P:1721.06 E:0.021880 |  And then passes the ball sideways.
[1249.00 - 1251.00] P:1835.25 E:0.026008 |  Dangerously though, when they change gear.
[1251.00 - 1253.00] P:1743.54 E:0.027072 |  Now the ball swung in towards Balotelli.
[1253.00 - 1255.00] P:1823.28 E:0.024594 |  Ahead of Balotelli.
[1255.00 - 1257.00] P:1798.98 E:0.022834 |  And it's easily caught by Johar.
[1257.00 - 1259.00] P:1910.69 E:0.022557 |  You're going to allow him to have the ball up until now.
[1259.00 - 1261.00] P:1675.34 E:0.023755 |  With a comfortable possession.
[1261.00 - 1263.00] P:1708.31 E:0.021211 |  But what they're doing is staying organised.
[1263.00 - 1265.00] P:1765.20 E:0.025750 |  Just controlled by Welbeck.
[1265.00 - 1267.00] P:1788.87 E:0.028068 |  Feeds it on quickly to Sturridge.
[1267.00 - 1269.00] P:1876.86 E:0.026345 |  Sturridge cutting it from the right side.
[1269.00 - 1271.00] P:1863.45 E:0.026423 |  Takes on Palate.
[1271.00 - 1273.00] P:1836.33 E:0.026554 |  Into the fennels here.
[1273.00 - 1275.00] P:1829.84 E:0.027754 |  Trying to pull it back.
[1275.00 - 1277.00] P:1902.63 E:0.025951 |  But it was a good run by Daniel Sturridge.
[1277.00 - 1279.00] P:1912.57 E:0.024242 |  Again, positive from Daniel Sturridge.
[1279.00 - 1281.00] P:1865.12 E:0.023295 |  Showing that he's got the legs on those Italian defenders.
[1281.00 - 1283.00] P:1697.00 E:0.024525 |  That will worry them.
[1283.00 - 1285.00] P:1810.53 E:0.021161 |  The only slight problem for England is that
[1285.00 - 1287.00] P:1800.67 E:0.023614 |  the Italian fullbacks are both getting forward at times.
[1287.00 - 1289.00] P:1720.59 E:0.021450 |  The midfielders aren't picking them up.
[1289.00 - 1291.00] P:1745.01 E:0.022192 |  And their formation is more of a 4-1-2-2-1.
[1291.00 - 1293.00] P:1694.15 E:0.026528 |  With Candreva and Verati
[1293.00 - 1295.00] P:1668.16 E:0.024298 |  playing off Balotelli, if you like.
[1295.00 - 1297.00] P:1717.38 E:0.022157 |  And sometimes they're just finding those balls
[1297.00 - 1299.00] P:1719.77 E:0.019654 |  in those little pockets in between.
[1299.00 - 1301.00] P:1769.40 E:0.024936 |  Steven Gerard, Jordan Henderson.
[1301.00 - 1303.00] P:1752.51 E:0.025416 |  And then they're playing off Balotelli.
[1303.00 - 1305.00] P:1744.79 E:0.024185 |  And then they're playing off the ball in between
[1305.00 - 1307.00] P:1766.96 E:0.023862 |  Steven Gerard, Jordan Henderson and the English defence.
[1307.00 - 1309.00] P:1781.60 E:0.023520 |  That's the only time that England look in a little bit of trouble.
[1309.00 - 1311.00] P:1623.10 E:0.021034 |  Sterling just tapped the ankle of Verati.
[1311.00 - 1313.00] P:1805.20 E:0.023588 |  So it's a free kick to Italy.
[1313.00 - 1315.00] P:1728.83 E:0.027571 |  Taking quickly.
[1315.00 - 1317.00] P:1748.47 E:0.023583 |  Kealini, poaching the England penalty area.
[1317.00 - 1319.00] P:1722.24 E:0.025325 |  His pass should have been collected properly.
[1319.00 - 1321.00] P:1689.54 E:0.023588 |  Henderson intercepted though.
[1321.00 - 1323.00] P:1749.13 E:0.026591 |  And England see the referee blue for a free kick.
[1323.00 - 1325.00] P:1809.37 E:0.025683 |  England had possession and could have started a counterattack.
[1325.00 - 1327.00] P:1758.62 E:0.022963 |  Wanted to start a counterattack.
[1327.00 - 1329.00] P:1681.96 E:0.023519 |  But now they're bringing the ball back to where the referee wants the free kick.
[1329.00 - 1331.00] P:1810.11 E:0.022284 |  Fixed side is Ian Dennis.
[1331.00 - 1333.00] P:1676.28 E:0.026348 |  Breathless here Alan.
[1333.00 - 1335.00] P:1610.40 E:0.029483 |  That breeze that was around 45 minutes ago
[1335.00 - 1337.00] P:1713.56 E:0.030709 |  could do with returning.
[1337.00 - 1339.00] P:1711.28 E:0.029294 |  I think for the players' point of view, it's stifling pitch side.
[1339.00 - 1341.00] P:1631.61 E:0.030492 |  But the England supporters behind me, as you may well hear,
[1341.00 - 1343.00] P:1722.43 E:0.029685 |  are in excellent voice.
[1343.00 - 1345.00] P:1714.28 E:0.026762 |  14 minutes played.
[1345.00 - 1347.00] P:1792.95 E:0.026974 |  You're listening to 5 Live in the BBC, your work-up station.
[1347.00 - 1349.00] P:1764.88 E:0.027208 |  England 0, Italy 0.
[1349.00 - 1351.00] P:1783.26 E:0.024316 |  England with those two early shots and goal.
[1351.00 - 1353.00] P:1799.36 E:0.027379 |  That was certainly the second of them
[1353.00 - 1355.00] P:1710.36 E:0.021531 |  from Jordan Henderson.
[1355.00 - 1357.00] P:1704.79 E:0.021800 |  Provoked a save from Syriacou.
[1357.00 - 1359.00] P:1619.35 E:0.022106 |  And then they're playing off the ball.
[1359.00 - 1361.00] P:1837.44 E:0.021970 |  That was certainly the second of them from Jordan Henderson.
[1361.00 - 1363.00] P:1769.47 E:0.023361 |  Provoked a save from Syriacou.
[1363.00 - 1365.00] P:1761.70 E:0.023612 |  The first one by Raheem Sterling.
[1365.00 - 1367.00] P:1943.67 E:0.024444 |  Filled me.
[1367.00 - 1369.00] P:1973.60 E:0.024996 |  I thought it was the net.
[1369.00 - 1371.00] P:1835.04 E:0.025872 |  Of course, it was only the side.
[1371.00 - 1373.00] P:1714.11 E:0.027384 |  Got all excited, Alan, for a minute.
[1373.00 - 1375.00] P:1791.02 E:0.027734 |  It's the most excited I've been in your company, Danny,
[1375.00 - 1377.00] P:1836.74 E:0.026960 |  for a few days now.
[1377.00 - 1379.00] P:1793.96 E:0.023952 |  We've got a long time together.
[1379.00 - 1381.00] P:1765.53 E:0.021968 |  It's only going to get worse, don't worry.
[1381.00 - 1383.00] P:1785.62 E:0.022192 |  Kale for England.
[1383.00 - 1385.00] P:1847.98 E:0.025119 |  Onto Johnson.
[1385.00 - 1387.00] P:1851.73 E:0.022783 |  Johnson over the half way line.
[1387.00 - 1389.00] P:1815.54 E:0.027653 |  He's folding off two England players,
[1389.00 - 1391.00] P:1832.57 E:0.022132 |  but then he runs into a third Jordan Henderson.
[1391.00 - 1393.00] P:1745.06 E:0.023265 |  And it's now Wellbeck again.
[1393.00 - 1395.00] P:1795.19 E:0.019423 |  No one down the right side.
[1395.00 - 1397.00] P:1620.39 E:0.027644 |  It's back to Henderson.
[1397.00 - 1399.00] P:1780.28 E:0.020638 |  Sweeped by the Liverpool player to an Everett and fullback
[1399.00 - 1401.00] P:1741.13 E:0.023660 |  on the far side.
[1401.00 - 1403.00] P:1656.55 E:0.022581 |  Layton Baines into Sturridge.
[1403.00 - 1405.00] P:1607.11 E:0.025154 |  Inside the penalty area.
[1405.00 - 1407.00] P:1632.74 E:0.025923 |  Sturridge back to Wellbeck.
[1407.00 - 1409.00] P:1700.67 E:0.025210 |  And now taken up by Gerard.
[1409.00 - 1411.00] P:1714.56 E:0.025438 |  About 40 yards out from the Italian goal.
[1411.00 - 1413.00] P:1721.03 E:0.028930 |  He glides the ball to Glenn Johnson down the near side.
[1413.00 - 1415.00] P:1797.68 E:0.027140 |  The England right.
[1415.00 - 1417.00] P:1858.43 E:0.024486 |  And it's a goal for him.
[1417.00 - 1419.00] P:1833.00 E:0.025902 |  A little bit overambitious from Glenn Johnson.
[1419.00 - 1421.00] P:1791.36 E:0.024020 |  We have seen him cut in from the right fullback area before.
[1421.00 - 1423.00] P:1738.47 E:0.024561 |  And it has some decent shots in towards goal.
[1423.00 - 1425.00] P:1638.99 E:0.025094 |  That one just snaps at it a little bit.
[1425.00 - 1427.00] P:1613.45 E:0.023533 |  Panicked a little bit of nothing else.
[1427.00 - 1429.00] P:1677.70 E:0.023838 |  But no complaints from England so far.
[1429.00 - 1431.00] P:1662.44 E:0.026910 |  All the players are getting a good feel of the ball.
[1431.00 - 1433.00] P:1662.68 E:0.024905 |  They've started quite brightly.
[1433.00 - 1435.00] P:1649.60 E:0.025827 |  They've just got to keep their concentration.
[1435.00 - 1437.00] P:1495.80 E:0.027394 |  That could be the only thing that let England down.
[1437.00 - 1439.00] P:1488.74 E:0.026787 |  We are quite close to the equator here.
[1439.00 - 1441.00] P:1453.35 E:0.028208 |  In the Amazonian city of Manass.
[1441.00 - 1443.00] P:1544.20 E:0.027792 |  And it went from clear to clear.
[1443.00 - 1445.00] P:1545.07 E:0.022899 |  Blue sky very quickly.
[1445.00 - 1447.00] P:1668.97 E:0.026185 |  To total darkness above the arena.
[1447.00 - 1449.00] P:1634.42 E:0.024936 |  Brilliantly floodlit.
[1449.00 - 1451.00] P:1586.36 E:0.020926 |  And it's made for a top mark between two top countries.
[1451.00 - 1453.00] P:1605.09 E:0.024147 |  Here's Verati for Italy.
[1453.00 - 1455.00] P:1629.74 E:0.024011 |  Back to De Rossi in the centre circle.
[1455.00 - 1457.00] P:1608.67 E:0.025755 |  Pirlo available.
[1457.00 - 1459.00] P:1368.02 E:0.026714 |  He chooses not to play at the Pirlo.
[1459.00 - 1461.00] P:1540.13 E:0.027206 |  He comes to the left side to Chiellini.
[1461.00 - 1463.00] P:1542.98 E:0.027626 |  Now Marquesi.
[1463.00 - 1465.00] P:1517.06 E:0.028912 |  And Kezia back to De Rossi.
[1465.00 - 1467.00] P:1626.06 E:0.026884 |  At least slow in the build up.
[1467.00 - 1469.00] P:1450.16 E:0.027573 |  Verati, Darwin available on the far side.
[1469.00 - 1471.00] P:1509.47 E:0.024706 |  The pass is shorter than the ball.
[1471.00 - 1473.00] P:1700.76 E:0.027789 |  And it's Cendreva.
[1473.00 - 1475.00] P:1767.26 E:0.025971 |  Cendreva up to the edge of the England penalty.
[1475.00 - 1477.00] P:1801.26 E:0.027213 |  Then you expect Verati.
[1477.00 - 1479.00] P:1656.78 E:0.025624 |  Why did Darwin on the far side?
[1479.00 - 1481.00] P:1626.10 E:0.024200 |  Cendreva wants more.
[1481.00 - 1483.00] P:1614.61 E:0.023036 |  He's standing on the ball.
[1483.00 - 1485.00] P:1701.99 E:0.024325 |  And now, trade deep.
[1485.00 - 1487.00] P:1731.82 E:0.023926 |  Back towards the centre circle.
[1487.00 - 1489.00] P:1678.49 E:0.028270 |  Towards De Rossi.
[1489.00 - 1491.00] P:1631.61 E:0.026105 |  De Pirlo.
[1491.00 - 1493.00] P:1431.52 E:0.028453 |  De Rossi wants more.
[1493.00 - 1495.00] P:1578.77 E:0.026345 |  They'll wait and they'll wait and they'll wait.
[1495.00 - 1497.00] P:1619.91 E:0.026003 |  Until they see an angle where they can play.
[1497.00 - 1499.00] P:1570.73 E:0.028184 |  And a cute pass through.
[1499.00 - 1501.00] P:1724.13 E:0.025916 |  Back to Cendreva.
[1501.00 - 1503.00] P:1745.05 E:0.028788 |  His first time cross.
[1503.00 - 1505.00] P:1808.24 E:0.027353 |  Too long for two Italian players.
[1505.00 - 1507.00] P:1764.98 E:0.025682 |  Straight into the answer, Johard.
[1507.00 - 1509.00] P:1602.05 E:0.026306 |  17 minutes gone.
[1509.00 - 1511.00] P:1602.51 E:0.023347 |  0-0 England and Italy on 5-5.
[1511.00 - 1513.00] P:1664.31 E:0.022846 |  He's Henderson.
[1513.00 - 1515.00] P:1648.84 E:0.024619 |  Henderson to Wilbur.
[1515.00 - 1517.00] P:1842.69 E:0.025903 |  England started very brightly.
[1517.00 - 1519.00] P:1807.19 E:0.025751 |  But the Italians have been in
[1519.00 - 1521.00] P:1762.92 E:0.026911 |  command of possession over the last few minutes.
[1521.00 - 1523.00] P:1731.18 E:0.024769 |  Yeah, but I think we expected that.
[1523.00 - 1525.00] P:1744.09 E:0.024976 |  We know the Italians are always going to have
[1525.00 - 1527.00] P:1620.95 E:0.026271 |  an awful lot of possession.
[1527.00 - 1529.00] P:1642.38 E:0.026286 |  I think Verratti's just giving a foul away.
[1529.00 - 1531.00] P:1679.47 E:0.026357 |  On Raheem Sterling.
[1531.00 - 1533.00] P:1635.13 E:0.027045 |  He's just grabbed his shirt.
[1533.00 - 1535.00] P:1796.33 E:0.026130 |  Didn't want him to go forward.
[1535.00 - 1537.00] P:1748.33 E:0.028421 |  Got in his way.
[1537.00 - 1539.00] P:1815.60 E:0.027178 |  Typical Italian defending, if you like.
[1539.00 - 1541.00] P:1814.62 E:0.028393 |  England doing very, very well up till now.
[1541.00 - 1543.00] P:1782.06 E:0.027562 |  Pirlo is looking for that little ball.
[1543.00 - 1545.00] P:1745.85 E:0.028861 |  Dinking it over the top.
[1545.00 - 1547.00] P:1730.25 E:0.028197 |  That little floated right foot pass.
[1547.00 - 1549.00] P:1838.86 E:0.028798 |  Looking for runners going either from the field
[1549.00 - 1551.00] P:1869.11 E:0.027614 |  or from Ballatel.
[1551.00 - 1553.00] P:1884.58 E:0.027413 |  They scored like that in one of their warm-up games.
[1553.00 - 1555.00] P:1952.39 E:0.024911 |  That's a definite tactic they're trying to employ.
[1555.00 - 1557.00] P:1957.30 E:0.025967 |  And Gerard played the resultant three.
[1557.00 - 1559.00] P:1829.15 E:0.025241 |  Kick to Johnson.
[1559.00 - 1561.00] P:1794.01 E:0.026806 |  Back to Gerard.
[1561.00 - 1563.00] P:1770.00 E:0.024890 |  Jageel gone to Cale.
[1563.00 - 1565.00] P:1705.16 E:0.024717 |  Still inside his half.
[1565.00 - 1567.00] P:1717.73 E:0.027412 |  In the England half that is.
[1567.00 - 1569.00] P:1808.78 E:0.027552 |  Up to the halfway line.
[1569.00 - 1571.00] P:1923.62 E:0.026779 |  The ball played forward towards Johnson.
[1571.00 - 1573.00] P:1887.42 E:0.026496 |  Johnson's pass to Wilbur wasn't good.
[1573.00 - 1575.00] P:1773.13 E:0.022584 |  Pirlo takes it up for Ritley.
[1575.00 - 1577.00] P:1779.80 E:0.023798 |  Here's Verratti.
[1577.00 - 1579.00] P:1784.18 E:0.025614 |  Back to Pirlo.
[1579.00 - 1581.00] P:1791.49 E:0.028710 |  And Pirlo just chips it to the far side.
[1581.00 - 1583.00] P:1712.34 E:0.026042 |  And Damien.
[1583.00 - 1585.00] P:1866.50 E:0.026609 |  He goes his way.
[1585.00 - 1587.00] P:1828.29 E:0.024189 |  No one is really picking up.
[1587.00 - 1589.00] P:1806.11 E:0.026482 |  Pirlo.
[1589.00 - 1591.00] P:1776.81 E:0.024960 |  Maybe that's the way Hoshen has decided to play.
[1591.00 - 1593.00] P:1787.66 E:0.027188 |  On the far side of the field.
[1593.00 - 1595.00] P:1833.17 E:0.027899 |  It's with Damien once more.
[1595.00 - 1597.00] P:1878.44 E:0.028882 |  He's got Barzagli available.
[1597.00 - 1599.00] P:1970.41 E:0.027163 |  And it goes to Juventus, central defender.
[1599.00 - 1601.00] P:1973.84 E:0.026973 |  Juventus.
[1601.00 - 1603.00] P:1885.37 E:0.026207 |  Have three central defenders in this Italian squad.
[1603.00 - 1605.00] P:1786.15 E:0.024695 |  One of them in the centre of the fence tonight.
[1605.00 - 1607.00] P:1642.51 E:0.026414 |  The other playing it left back.
[1607.00 - 1609.00] P:1869.81 E:0.022166 |  Pirlo.
[1609.00 - 1611.00] P:1790.17 E:0.025770 |  Two of one of those central defenders.
[1611.00 - 1613.00] P:1744.65 E:0.026813 |  Kialini.
[1613.00 - 1615.00] P:1743.17 E:0.023611 |  Mintos.
[1615.00 - 1617.00] P:1747.22 E:0.025060 |  The ball was moved all over the place.
[1617.00 - 1619.00] P:1847.01 E:0.028478 |  There was a shot from distance.
[1619.00 - 1621.00] P:1768.27 E:0.026927 |  Even from a high vantage point.
[1621.00 - 1623.00] P:1813.75 E:0.028465 |  Luckily for Johar it didn't bounce
[1623.00 - 1625.00] P:1858.55 E:0.024309 |  just in front of him.
[1625.00 - 1627.00] P:1787.46 E:0.022398 |  But he did fumble it slightly.
[1627.00 - 1629.00] P:1850.34 E:0.022977 |  It has a close smile.
[1629.00 - 1631.00] P:1864.82 E:0.023425 |  It blows his cheeks out.
[1631.00 - 1633.00] P:1813.84 E:0.021723 |  It's a difficult one.
[1633.00 - 1635.00] P:1817.77 E:0.025863 |  It's down to the humidity.
[1635.00 - 1637.00] P:1762.20 E:0.022340 |  The ball sometimes flies around a bit.
[1637.00 - 1639.00] P:1923.83 E:0.026250 |  That was a climb that came a while ago.
[1639.00 - 1642.00] P:1806.02 E:0.024599 |  the ball sometimes flies a little bit differently.
[1642.00 - 1645.00] P:1789.32 E:0.022459 |  You were saying to me earlier you didn't think it was quite as
[1645.00 - 1648.00] P:1750.27 E:0.027058 |  humid as you would expect? No, it's not. It's not as humid.
[1648.00 - 1650.00] P:1761.44 E:0.025047 |  It's still very, very hot. Although now it's dark, the
[1650.00 - 1652.00] P:1889.74 E:0.026540 |  temperature drops slightly.
[1652.00 - 1654.00] P:1765.41 E:0.024551 |  Mckesee tried to find Ballotelli, but it's quickly snuffed out
[1654.00 - 1657.00] P:1708.66 E:0.023293 |  that combination of Cahill and Johnson.
[1657.00 - 1660.00] P:1753.21 E:0.023503 |  It's a little bit like a swing bowler. Obviously playing
[1660.00 - 1662.00] P:1828.92 E:0.023914 |  cricket, they're looking for the low clack of a little bit of
[1662.00 - 1665.00] P:1791.19 E:0.024439 |  humidity can make the ball swing. Obviously the humidity is
[1665.00 - 1668.00] P:1758.65 E:0.025334 |  still very, very humid compared to what we are used to.
[1668.00 - 1672.00] P:1767.58 E:0.025683 |  Again, those long shots will just affect the ball very, very
[1672.00 - 1675.00] P:1688.98 E:0.023869 |  slightly. Well, Citigau had a couple of problems early on
[1675.00 - 1678.00] P:1808.06 E:0.022487 |  with England long-range shooting.
[1678.00 - 1682.00] P:1701.54 E:0.026143 |  England fans, I think, outnumber the Italians who voted inside
[1682.00 - 1687.00] P:1867.35 E:0.027714 |  this arena. It's still beggars' belief for me how far they're
[1687.00 - 1691.00] P:1795.01 E:0.025459 |  happy to travel. It's not just a matter of going to Rio and
[1691.00 - 1694.00] P:1722.39 E:0.023822 |  having a sort of holiday-come-world cup in Rio.
[1694.00 - 1698.00] P:1663.67 E:0.025269 |  They've made the 1,800-mile journeys we did yesterday, Danny,
[1698.00 - 1703.00] P:1739.46 E:0.024386 |  the plane ride off to Manaus. Here's Raheem Sterling on the
[1703.00 - 1706.00] P:1671.07 E:0.025741 |  far side of the field. Sterling started brightly.
[1706.00 - 1709.00] P:1609.16 E:0.028565 |  He jinxed inside one defender, then runs into another and loses
[1709.00 - 1712.00] P:1862.85 E:0.028074 |  the ball, and Perlos slid to the far side of the field.
[1712.00 - 1715.00] P:1976.40 E:0.027294 |  And, Italy will counterattack here. Only Ballotelli is through
[1715.00 - 1718.00] P:1886.22 E:0.026497 |  the middle. The pass is ended, Ballotelli. It hits Jagiolka
[1718.00 - 1721.00] P:1751.10 E:0.023650 |  and then loops in the air. Jagiolka heads it carefully back to
[1721.00 - 1724.00] P:1804.10 E:0.024302 |  Johar. That's what England have to be careful of.
[1724.00 - 1726.00] P:1778.27 E:0.025631 |  Several times in their warm-up games they've been hit when they've
[1726.00 - 1729.00] P:1753.86 E:0.023378 |  given the ball away, and then the opposition have been able to
[1729.00 - 1733.00] P:1755.53 E:0.023390 |  break. The turnover of possession England must concentrate.
[1733.00 - 1736.00] P:1737.78 E:0.025038 |  When they give the ball away in that final third, they must be in
[1736.00 - 1739.00] P:1837.83 E:0.023192 |  a position, a very good sound defensive position, to stop Italy
[1739.00 - 1742.00] P:1682.13 E:0.024103 |  attacking them very, very quickly. If you weren't listening to
[1742.00 - 1745.00] P:1566.18 E:0.024163 |  Five Live earlier, you'll have missed it easily.
[1745.00 - 1748.00] P:1652.44 E:0.026569 |  In my view, the upset of the World Cup so far, and that takes
[1748.00 - 1750.00] P:1569.75 E:0.025221 |  a little bit of a time to look at.
[1750.00 - 1754.00] P:1621.70 E:0.024765 |  Spain losing five on to Holland. Uruguay won Costa Rica three.
[1754.00 - 1759.00] P:1629.98 E:0.024861 |  And, Pereira, the Uruguayan was sent off.
[1759.00 - 1763.00] P:1664.91 E:0.024983 |  He will miss England's game against the South Americans in
[1763.00 - 1767.00] P:1739.20 E:0.025935 |  Sao Paulo. Here's Henderson breaking forward on the right side.
[1767.00 - 1770.00] P:1757.33 E:0.026519 |  Henderson gets there before Coletta.
[1770.00 - 1774.00] P:1735.02 E:0.025243 |  Henderson wide towards the right, and it goes to Welbeck.
[1774.00 - 1777.00] P:1717.00 E:0.025956 |  Welbeck slides the pass back to Gerard. Gerard a long way out.
[1777.00 - 1780.00] P:1780.08 E:0.025183 |  Chips into the far side. Sterling brings it under control.
[1780.00 - 1783.00] P:1727.75 E:0.027238 |  Just outside the penalty here. Takes on the ball back.
[1783.00 - 1786.00] P:1837.76 E:0.028641 |  Crosses goes a great cross. And goodness gracious, that was an
[1786.00 - 1789.00] P:1842.87 E:0.027943 |  interesting challenge, let's say, on Welbeck on the edge of the
[1789.00 - 1791.00] P:1740.61 E:0.027697 |  six-yard box, but they're roughly ignored it.
[1791.00 - 1794.00] P:1843.42 E:0.026423 |  Brilliant from Raheem Sterling yet again. This time on the left-hand
[1794.00 - 1797.00] P:1827.60 E:0.026417 |  side, drove the ball across the six-yard box.
[1797.00 - 1801.00] P:1835.81 E:0.026078 |  Welbeck was never really going to get there, but the two centre-backs
[1801.00 - 1806.00] P:1793.10 E:0.025849 |  came charging. Barzagli and Peletta just blocked him out of
[1806.00 - 1809.00] P:1780.44 E:0.026816 |  the box again. That Italian defending that we're so used to.
[1809.00 - 1812.00] P:1660.41 E:0.025818 |  Putting their body in the way, little short pulls and blockages.
[1812.00 - 1815.00] P:1731.63 E:0.029772 |  To pick side, Neymar Dennis. Just to say, Alan, from that shot
[1815.00 - 1818.00] P:1680.45 E:0.029067 |  before at Jilhar, I can't repeat what he said, despite being after
[1818.00 - 1821.00] P:1706.27 E:0.029221 |  the watershed, but I can tell you that after his expression, he was
[1821.00 - 1824.00] P:1647.07 E:0.030555 |  surprised at the level of how that ball deviated in the air, and
[1824.00 - 1827.00] P:1661.12 E:0.027648 |  that will be a key feature of these Brazucas, how they move in the
[1827.00 - 1833.00] P:1569.62 E:0.022906 |  air. Goodness, it's 20 pass, midnight, and beyond that, back in
[1833.00 - 1838.00] P:1744.63 E:0.025994 |  the UK. 20 pass, I'm still on realtime.
[1838.00 - 1841.00] P:1645.84 E:0.024344 |  20 pass to 11 hours. I'm still on realtime. I'm hoping this is my
[1841.00 - 1845.00] P:1666.59 E:0.027905 |  only game in this region during the World Cup. Manass is an hour
[1845.00 - 1849.00] P:1829.40 E:0.026278 |  behind, real. Here's Balotelli. Balotelli shoots over the
[1849.00 - 1852.00] P:1740.86 E:0.029049 |  crossbar and also Whitefield, we're midway through the first half,
[1852.00 - 1854.00] P:1905.60 E:0.027734 |  and here's my finger.
[1854.00 - 1859.00] P:1913.57 E:0.027881 |  Well, after all the talk about the pitch, it's OK, isn't it, Daniel?
[1859.00 - 1863.00] P:1835.39 E:0.024407 |  Yeah, pitch is absolutely fine. I know it's been a sprayed dream,
[1863.00 - 1866.00] P:1698.26 E:0.025934 |  but it's not causing any problems. There's no real bubbles, and all
[1866.00 - 1870.00] P:1780.46 E:0.024049 |  this fear about this intense heat and humidity has pretty much gone
[1870.00 - 1874.00] P:1782.34 E:0.024983 |  away. Yes, it's very, very warm. I expect pitch time now, might be
[1874.00 - 1878.00] P:1800.28 E:0.023546 |  25 degrees or so, maybe, but obviously it's dark now, and the
[1878.00 - 1882.00] P:1687.38 E:0.025596 |  humidity is very, very low. England playing from left to right,
[1882.00 - 1885.00] P:1884.85 E:0.029609 |  and going forward into the areas. Danny Welbeck, and he's balling
[1885.00 - 1889.00] P:1939.58 E:0.029247 |  back to Sturridge, goes off the defender. And it'll be a corner kick
[1889.00 - 1894.00] P:1905.23 E:0.027764 |  over on the far side. How lucky are Italy in that situation?
[1894.00 - 1899.00] P:1920.26 E:0.025350 |  Barzagli got a touch, it loops over the top, as Welbeck strode into
[1899.00 - 1903.00] P:1862.37 E:0.025993 |  the box, again drove the ball across the face of goal.
[1903.00 - 1908.00] P:1914.15 E:0.026202 |  Barzagli sliding in towards his own goal, hit his right foot,
[1908.00 - 1912.00] P:1923.01 E:0.024751 |  looped up, Sturlin, a story story couldn't get there, looped past
[1912.00 - 1916.00] P:1896.78 E:0.026305 |  the far post and out for a corner. Corner kick to England then,
[1916.00 - 1920.00] P:1852.83 E:0.026451 |  over on the far side to be whipped in by the captain, Stephen Gerrard.
[1920.00 - 1924.00] P:1932.50 E:0.028033 |  It travelled a very long way, almost dropped to Rooney, who bundles
[1924.00 - 1927.00] P:1886.91 E:0.024995 |  for possession at the far post, and it's gone behind for another
[1927.00 - 1930.00] P:1948.23 E:0.027886 |  England corner. Italian defence looking very, very shaky.
[1930.00 - 1934.00] P:1915.87 E:0.027593 |  Brilliant ball in from Stephen Gerrard, whipped in with pace,
[1934.00 - 1937.00] P:1781.09 E:0.026298 |  players going in, almost fell to Wayne Rooney at the far post. How it
[1937.00 - 1940.00] P:1785.32 E:0.026650 |  got through all those players, I do not know, but it's another corner.
[1940.00 - 1944.00] P:1813.27 E:0.028057 |  Five live at the World Cup in Manasse, England nil, Italy nil, 23,
[1944.00 - 1948.00] P:1844.31 E:0.025131 |  nearly 24 minutes gone in the first half, and England have had
[1948.00 - 1952.00] P:1811.93 E:0.027160 |  three strikes at the Italian goal in the first ten minutes.
[1952.00 - 1955.00] P:1842.85 E:0.025922 |  Syragoo, the replacement for the injured Buffon, and now Leighton
[1955.00 - 1958.00] P:1738.39 E:0.026700 |  Baines prepares to take this left-footed corner. There are words
[1958.00 - 1963.00] P:1707.07 E:0.025984 |  between the referee and Syragoo and Daniel Sturridge, and now
[1963.00 - 1967.00] P:1782.44 E:0.025455 |  we'll have this England corner. England going forward, looking
[1967.00 - 1971.00] P:1806.60 E:0.024945 |  pretty good, but the Italians on the counterattack, often dangerous.
[1971.00 - 1974.00] P:1760.17 E:0.027270 |  Here comes the England corner kick, hoisted high, Syragoo spilled
[1974.00 - 1977.00] P:1869.70 E:0.026636 |  it first time and then holds on to it second time. The only problem
[1977.00 - 1980.00] P:1928.14 E:0.024435 |  really, watching while Alan was commentating, the danger seems to
[1980.00 - 1983.00] P:1767.15 E:0.024767 |  be from Italy down that right-hand side. The full-back Damian
[1983.00 - 1986.00] P:1852.89 E:0.023421 |  gouts forward very quickly, and there's great support from
[1986.00 - 1989.00] P:1671.47 E:0.024613 |  Cam Draver, who looks quite a player, and so Leighton Baines and
[1989.00 - 1993.00] P:1859.88 E:0.023777 |  Phil Jagialka are going to have to be really sharp this evening.
[1993.00 - 1996.00] P:1926.63 E:0.025497 |  Nil nil on five live as the ball is played to Damian, who's
[1996.00 - 1999.00] P:1899.26 E:0.023781 |  winning only his second cap. Damian bursting forward, looks to
[1999.00 - 2002.00] P:1793.98 E:0.025052 |  Ballatelli, now it goes to Cam Draver, worked back into midfield
[2002.00 - 2006.00] P:1784.09 E:0.026175 |  and Perlow, who's 30 yards away from Joe Hart's goal. Still
[2006.00 - 2010.00] P:1782.81 E:0.024055 |  Perlow, biding his time, looking for his clubmate, Kylini. Kylini
[2010.00 - 2013.00] P:1838.59 E:0.027558 |  tackled by Johnson, and the fact that the full-backs can go
[2013.00 - 2016.00] P:1780.85 E:0.026906 |  forward, De Rossi is protecting them and almost becoming at times
[2016.00 - 2019.00] P:1735.43 E:0.022779 |  one of three centre-backs for Italy. He's also played there
[2019.00 - 2023.00] P:1685.07 E:0.025012 |  before as well, we must add, but it is, it's effectively, you've got
[2023.00 - 2027.00] P:1700.70 E:0.025215 |  Marquisio and Cam Draver playing behind Ballatelli. Two players
[2027.00 - 2031.00] P:1710.36 E:0.024236 |  sat behind them in Verratti and Perlow, and then one deeper in
[2031.00 - 2034.00] P:1721.01 E:0.026185 |  that hold midfield role. And it's just causing one or two problems,
[2034.00 - 2037.00] P:1709.74 E:0.023457 |  as you said, out wide, especially on that right-hand side at the
[2037.00 - 2040.00] P:1626.29 E:0.025758 |  moment. Danny Mills with us on five live, they do pass the ball
[2040.00 - 2043.00] P:1795.06 E:0.027135 |  around beautifully the Italians when they're in possession. Now it's
[2043.00 - 2045.00] P:1752.34 E:0.026736 |  Rooney back in defence, looking that pass towards Stirling was a bit
[2045.00 - 2048.00] P:1846.71 E:0.027456 |  short, in came the challenge from Damian, which takes Stirling out,
[2048.00 - 2051.00] P:1793.26 E:0.026381 |  and it's going to be a free kick to England back inside their own
[2051.00 - 2055.00] P:1716.91 E:0.026100 |  half. It's the second time the countries have met in the World Cup,
[2055.00 - 2059.00] P:1706.74 E:0.024981 |  the other time was, I suppose, a bit of a non-event really, because it
[2059.00 - 2062.00] P:1582.60 E:0.024524 |  was for third and fourth place after England suffered that semi-final
[2062.00 - 2066.00] P:1651.28 E:0.024594 |  defeat in 1990 in Italy in 90, and it wasn't the England first team
[2066.00 - 2070.00] P:1682.72 E:0.023798 |  that played that night, it was Shilton's last game. Italy all in blue,
[2070.00 - 2075.00] P:1622.32 E:0.024854 |  of course, De Rossi, who's approaching 100 caps for Italy. It's always a
[2075.00 - 2078.00] P:1702.10 E:0.027544 |  game too many, that isn't it Mike, that third and fourth place player,
[2078.00 - 2082.00] P:1818.68 E:0.027837 |  nobody wants to be in that. I'm surprised up until now, they haven't
[2082.00 - 2087.00] P:1885.96 E:0.027905 |  yet ridden that. Now Verratti over on that right-hand side of the
[2087.00 - 2090.00] P:1814.91 E:0.026999 |  field, and there's a lot of experience in this Italian team, but there's
[2090.00 - 2093.00] P:1699.79 E:0.023903 |  also a lot of inexperience at international level. There are four
[2093.00 - 2098.00] P:1774.55 E:0.024615 |  players with less than 10 caps, and now his young Verratti onto the
[2098.00 - 2102.00] P:1806.89 E:0.026713 |  Centurion Perlo, the captain, and now Keelini, who's inside the England
[2102.00 - 2108.00] P:1644.66 E:0.027007 |  half. It's Nil Nil here in Manasse, and on a very humid evening, it's a
[2108.00 - 2112.00] P:1731.86 E:0.024845 |  sauna heat down there really for these players. Italy with Can Draver, who
[2112.00 - 2116.00] P:1785.40 E:0.026700 |  turns and finds the ever-willing full-back Damia. Ballatelli's poised in
[2116.00 - 2120.00] P:1718.92 E:0.025603 |  the area, but the ball goes short. Still Can Draver, England have got just
[2120.00 - 2124.00] P:1652.24 E:0.025714 |  about everybody back apart from Sturridge. Verratti now to De Rossi, and
[2124.00 - 2129.00] P:1749.35 E:0.027012 |  back again to Verratti. Can Draver now, takes this shot on, and it was
[2129.00 - 2133.00] P:1797.10 E:0.026825 |  well-wide in the end. Jo Hart not forced into making any kind of a save there.
[2133.00 - 2137.00] P:1672.86 E:0.026753 |  That's a goal kicked to England. We've played 27 minutes. It's Nil Nil.
[2137.00 - 2142.00] P:1704.28 E:0.025964 |  Both goalkeepers not troubled to the excess. That one long-range shot that
[2142.00 - 2147.00] P:1758.86 E:0.026498 |  Jo Hart really had to keep his eyes, that they moved through the air. Sturlin
[2147.00 - 2151.00] P:1709.72 E:0.026763 |  had a decent chance of winning to side netting, and of course there was that
[2151.00 - 2154.00] P:1672.10 E:0.025527 |  fantastic strike from Jordan Henderson. But I think at the moment England
[2154.00 - 2158.00] P:1769.02 E:0.025958 |  we're fairly content with the way things are going. Maybe just want to get on
[2158.00 - 2163.00] P:1871.01 E:0.026237 |  the ball a little bit more, but Pirlo, as maybe not expected, hasn't really
[2163.00 - 2167.00] P:1730.69 E:0.026433 |  dictated the tempo of the play. Yes, he's getting on the ball from time to time,
[2167.00 - 2172.00] P:1776.08 E:0.025071 |  but up until now hasn't done anything of real no.
[2172.00 - 2175.00] P:1695.57 E:0.025664 |  Looked at him a couple of times when Alan was commentating Pirlo, and he gives
[2175.00 - 2179.00] P:1601.22 E:0.025678 |  the defender sometimes the eye. He looks one way and passes the other way.
[2179.00 - 2184.00] P:1606.22 E:0.025394 |  He's a fantastic player. And now England with Sturling in this role.
[2184.00 - 2187.00] P:1686.45 E:0.026787 |  Interestingly, Roy Hodgson brought Sturling on and played him in that role in
[2187.00 - 2191.00] P:1712.01 E:0.025397 |  that final game in London against Peru. So he's obviously thinking ahead to
[2191.00 - 2195.00] P:1772.21 E:0.024315 |  tonight. Now it's Welbeck into Sturling. Sturling up against the defender
[2195.00 - 2199.00] P:1722.94 E:0.025030 |  Paletta. Borges wouldn't come down for Danny Welbeck, but Sturling's kept it in.
[2199.00 - 2202.00] P:1721.14 E:0.027077 |  Little jinking run. There's always a second defender there though. He goes
[2202.00 - 2206.00] P:1813.31 E:0.024808 |  past the first one, and then of course the Italians who are masters at defending
[2206.00 - 2210.00] P:1705.24 E:0.024139 |  managed to get the cover when it's required. Johnson with an England throw,
[2210.00 - 2214.00] P:1698.58 E:0.024787 |  halfway inside the Italy half, down this near side the right. England nil,
[2214.00 - 2218.00] P:1701.27 E:0.027887 |  Italy nil in this opening game in the World Cup, which we've looked forward to
[2218.00 - 2223.00] P:1738.50 E:0.024802 |  for such a long time. Johnson, he'll lose that. Keelini, who's showing his
[2223.00 - 2228.00] P:1604.59 E:0.024534 |  great ability to play through the back four, playing it left back tonight,
[2228.00 - 2232.00] P:1854.73 E:0.025001 |  and now Barzagli over to Damian, who's found space once more down that right
[2232.00 - 2236.00] P:1720.39 E:0.024633 |  hand side. He's gone into midfield and Virati. England's Gerard just closing
[2236.00 - 2241.00] P:1784.64 E:0.024473 |  Virati down. Perlo just switched it on to Marquisio. Marquisio into Marco,
[2241.00 - 2245.00] P:1782.82 E:0.024241 |  into Mario Balletelli. Johnson will turn this ball back though to Joe Hart,
[2245.00 - 2250.00] P:1651.94 E:0.022765 |  and it's just dropped a gear or two in the last five minutes. Maybe the player
[2250.00 - 2255.00] P:1684.08 E:0.024092 |  is starting to feel the heat down there. It's Daniel Sturridge winning a throw
[2255.00 - 2260.00] P:1748.31 E:0.024704 |  in of Claudio Marquisio, but unlike the game when they last made in a tournament,
[2260.00 - 2264.00] P:1580.76 E:0.024817 |  which was pretty one-sided in terms of possession, England are giving as good
[2264.00 - 2267.00] P:1734.23 E:0.026344 |  as they're getting here, Danny. England are keeping the ball much better.
[2267.00 - 2270.00] P:1724.04 E:0.025055 |  They're not playing too many long balls, which makes it very, very awkward.
[2270.00 - 2274.00] P:1741.94 E:0.023951 |  As you mentioned, we know how good the Italian defenders are. Well-drilled,
[2274.00 - 2279.00] P:1733.35 E:0.025315 |  but also individually exceptional. They never let the man go past them.
[2279.00 - 2283.00] P:1729.80 E:0.024579 |  I'm pleased with England up till now. I don't think there's no real concern this
[2283.00 - 2287.00] P:1634.09 E:0.024983 |  game, and at the moment, there's no reason why they shouldn't go on and maybe win
[2287.00 - 2290.00] P:1761.50 E:0.026669 |  the game. No, you said something really interesting earlier on, and it's that
[2290.00 - 2294.00] P:1682.48 E:0.025567 |  concentration at this level. Every single second, you have to concentrate,
[2294.00 - 2298.00] P:1777.58 E:0.025560 |  and that's where the heat and the tiredness will come in. As you get towards
[2298.00 - 2302.00] P:1752.74 E:0.024884 |  the end of the game, the first thing that goes is concentration, and with the likes
[2302.00 - 2307.00] P:1756.76 E:0.026255 |  of Piero, it just takes one pass. That little scooped, flippy right-footed pass
[2307.00 - 2311.00] P:1716.75 E:0.026784 |  that just bends over the top of the defenders. That's what England are going to
[2311.00 - 2314.00] P:1725.11 E:0.024596 |  watch out for. Gerard, skim the ball forward. The ball ricochets off Paletta.
[2314.00 - 2317.00] P:1766.98 E:0.026767 |  England haven't hit too many long balls forward, and now they go forward again
[2317.00 - 2321.00] P:1702.09 E:0.024062 |  with Henderson. Sterling trying to control it up against Kylini, who just brushes him
[2321.00 - 2325.00] P:1777.25 E:0.024685 |  aside. Kylini puts his foot on the ball by the touchline. Sterling is trying to
[2325.00 - 2331.00] P:1733.02 E:0.025557 |  deny him, and then the referee has penalised Sterling. And given the Italians
[2331.00 - 2335.00] P:1747.55 E:0.023683 |  a free kick. Back to Ian Dennis, who's down watching pitchside.
[2335.00 - 2338.00] P:1610.19 E:0.025779 |  Yes, behind the goal. Away to your left, Mike. Just a few moments ago, Baines,
[2338.00 - 2341.00] P:1698.86 E:0.028853 |  Jagie Elker and Rune were in a discussion because I think Baines is wary of being
[2341.00 - 2345.00] P:1646.27 E:0.027989 |  isolated. Playing a narrow back four, he is tucking in, but when Candreba looks to
[2345.00 - 2349.00] P:1774.77 E:0.025260 |  come forward and play in Damien from fullback, Baines needs more support on
[2349.00 - 2354.00] P:1842.68 E:0.024746 |  England's left-hand side. I think that's absolutely right. I think we've picked
[2354.00 - 2357.00] P:1795.76 E:0.025500 |  that out from here already. That seems to be one of the biggest sources of
[2357.00 - 2361.00] P:1820.64 E:0.025177 |  danger for England when the ball is right, but now it's left of Mckesio. England
[2361.00 - 2365.00] P:1884.21 E:0.026140 |  nearly nearly in the World Cup on five line. Earlier that incredible result,
[2365.00 - 2368.00] P:1877.53 E:0.027072 |  Costa Rica, Uruguay, Costa Rica winning three-one. That's a long ball through
[2368.00 - 2372.00] P:1794.59 E:0.023420 |  to Balotelli, which his former city teammate, Hart, has. And now Gerard,
[2372.00 - 2376.00] P:1721.98 E:0.024145 |  who's got the Dorossi role in the England team, finds Baines over on the left-hand
[2376.00 - 2380.00] P:1718.22 E:0.023967 |  side. He hasn't been able to get forward very much so far, late in Baines. Rune
[2380.00 - 2383.00] P:1704.26 E:0.025336 |  playing in this wide position, brings the ball in field. It's a little bit slow
[2383.00 - 2386.00] P:1739.80 E:0.024937 |  now from England. They just dropped the tempo a little bit. Rune wants the free
[2386.00 - 2391.00] P:1786.34 E:0.024859 |  kick as the defender went climbing all over him. Dorossi, who's a volatile
[2391.00 - 2396.00] P:1710.56 E:0.024935 |  character, and England do have the free kick. Four of these Italians
[2396.00 - 2401.00] P:1638.80 E:0.025358 |  experienced World Cup victory in 2006. Great experience. Dorossi,
[2401.00 - 2407.00] P:1809.55 E:0.027464 |  Kealini, Barzagli, and Perlo. No buffon tonight. He's at his fifth World Cup.
[2407.00 - 2411.00] P:1817.43 E:0.027473 |  He's watching on. Serigo's got had a good start, though, in goal, away to our
[2411.00 - 2414.00] P:1878.09 E:0.026660 |  right. But now here's this England free kick. It's a long way out from Stephen
[2414.00 - 2418.00] P:1830.20 E:0.026708 |  Gerard, but this ball is moving around. Gerard's kicking in the end. It's
[2418.00 - 2422.00] P:1767.40 E:0.024683 |  really disappointing because it just bounces tingly up at goalkeeper Serigo,
[2422.00 - 2426.00] P:1784.69 E:0.024273 |  and nobody can get on the end of that. Seems to be a little bit of miscommunication
[2426.00 - 2430.00] P:1743.96 E:0.024943 |  about where Stephen Gerard was going to put the ball and bounce harmlessly
[2430.00 - 2433.00] P:1788.57 E:0.024175 |  through to the goalkeeper. But that right-hand side is a little bit of a
[2433.00 - 2438.00] P:1752.13 E:0.025049 |  problem. Kealini, centre-back by trade, naturally doesn't really want to get
[2438.00 - 2441.00] P:1785.45 E:0.025596 |  forward, or not with any great pace. But it's Darmine on that right-hand side
[2441.00 - 2445.00] P:1772.35 E:0.024598 |  and Candre, who's starting to cause one or two problems for Leighton Bones.
[2445.00 - 2450.00] P:1791.76 E:0.024613 |  England nil, Italy nil. Verratti now for Italy, finding Dorossi, who's venturing
[2450.00 - 2454.00] P:1768.35 E:0.024297 |  forward. He hasn't done that very much so far. Verratti now moves the ball onto
[2454.00 - 2458.00] P:1858.58 E:0.024690 |  Perlo. Perlo's on the edge of the England area. England are trying to make it
[2458.00 - 2461.00] P:1763.86 E:0.023427 |  tight. Finds Dorossi that full-back. Darmine's made the run into the area
[2461.00 - 2464.00] P:1842.61 E:0.027772 |  once more. He wasn't picked up. It's for Balotelli. Balotelli's head down
[2464.00 - 2469.00] P:1806.38 E:0.026818 |  across the face. And there's the danger. Dorossi waited for Darmine to make his
[2469.00 - 2474.00] P:1816.08 E:0.024925 |  move down the far side. And it almost cost England that. That really does need
[2474.00 - 2478.00] P:1777.54 E:0.024074 |  to be sorted out. And I'm not surprised Jagi Elkar and Bones have been talking
[2478.00 - 2482.00] P:1787.40 E:0.024731 |  to each other. Huge escape for Italy. Balotelli should have done better with
[2482.00 - 2486.00] P:1724.97 E:0.024399 |  that header. But again, it was that ball out to the right-hand side. England a
[2486.00 - 2490.00] P:1618.08 E:0.025827 |  little bit exposed out there. Wayne Rooney, you know, caught between two
[2490.00 - 2494.00] P:1572.87 E:0.024503 |  stalls at times. You know, got caught in no man's land. That ball crossed into
[2494.00 - 2498.00] P:1571.82 E:0.023035 |  the box. Balotelli didn't quite get enough from the header. And England breathed
[2498.00 - 2502.00] P:1596.53 E:0.025636 |  a huge sigh of relief. But as the ball gets switched again to Darmine, he doesn't
[2502.00 - 2506.00] P:1664.52 E:0.023588 |  need any excuse at all to get forward, Darmine. Only his second cap, but he's
[2506.00 - 2510.00] P:1565.75 E:0.024851 |  he really has settled down well here. And what a menace he's proving down that
[2510.00 - 2515.00] P:1786.78 E:0.026933 |  right-hand side. Now, Marquisio. And again, Darmine is available. But Marquisio
[2515.00 - 2519.00] P:1867.44 E:0.025030 |  slides the ball into the area. And that's a corner kick off Leighton Baines
[2519.00 - 2525.00] P:1830.34 E:0.023798 |  for Italy. And of course, they are pretty good at set pieces the Italians.
[2525.00 - 2528.00] P:1865.10 E:0.024632 |  Roy Hodges, sorry, Mike. Roy Hodges is going to have to address this at half
[2528.00 - 2533.00] P:1818.63 E:0.024434 |  time. Can Draver and Darmine are getting far too often down that right-hand
[2533.00 - 2537.00] P:1843.33 E:0.025487 |  side with time and space in the final third. And soon related, if England aren't
[2537.00 - 2541.00] P:1881.40 E:0.024864 |  careful, they may pay. Well, Keelini and Barzagli have gone forward for the
[2541.00 - 2544.00] P:1817.40 E:0.024530 |  corner. It's a short corner though, taking to Verratti, who tucks it back to
[2544.00 - 2550.00] P:1967.21 E:0.028576 |  Perlow. Let's it run on to Marquisio. Marquisio strikes! Italy score. Marquisio
[2550.00 - 2555.00] P:1909.09 E:0.029436 |  was a well-worked training ground routine. The short corner, Perlow to
[2555.00 - 2561.00] P:1931.03 E:0.028775 |  Marquisio. Marquisio leaves. Johart helpless. And Italy lead 1-0.
[2561.00 - 2566.00] P:1894.71 E:0.027920 |  Devastating for England. A fantastic strike from Marquisio. I have to say
[2566.00 - 2573.00] P:1895.65 E:0.028702 |  that. A well-worked corner. A great strike. England now. Got a bounce back.
[2574.00 - 2578.00] P:1885.00 E:0.028441 |  What was I saying about them being pretty good at set pieces? Down to Ian
[2578.00 - 2583.00] P:1898.13 E:0.030070 |  Dennis' pitchside. Johart with his screw in at places just kicked the turf in
[2583.00 - 2588.00] P:1887.90 E:0.028962 |  anger. Not very happy as he just stands and looks on with his hands on hips.
[2588.00 - 2593.00] P:1814.19 E:0.029867 |  And at this opportunity as well, the England players are actually taking the
[2593.00 - 2597.00] P:1799.59 E:0.028869 |  advantage of the stoppage in play after conceding that goal to take on some
[2597.00 - 2600.00] P:1733.38 E:0.028675 |  liquid refreshments. So bottles of water are being thrown to them from the
[2600.00 - 2603.00] P:1784.91 E:0.028823 |  dugout. And also I should say as well that there is a photographer just by
[2603.00 - 2606.00] P:1774.55 E:0.028822 |  the side of me who is actually requiring some medical assistance. He's
[2606.00 - 2610.00] P:1736.90 E:0.028118 |  struggling with the heat. So it might be a little bit fresher up in the
[2610.00 - 2614.00] P:1735.46 E:0.028097 |  commentary box but certainly pitchside. It is stifling. And England now in the
[2614.00 - 2619.00] P:1757.54 E:0.027819 |  heat are going to have to do it the hard way to come from behind.
[2619.00 - 2622.00] P:1803.56 E:0.026508 |  Thank you, Ian. Don't forget by the way you can follow Five Lives commentary on
[2622.00 - 2628.00] P:1826.62 E:0.024955 |  TV. If you flick the red button, we're there for you. But, well, Perlow and
[2628.00 - 2631.00] P:1885.35 E:0.027287 |  Marquisio, of course, have a great understanding playing together in midfield
[2631.00 - 2635.00] P:1877.11 E:0.025732 |  for Juventus. They've probably done that quite a few times together. But
[2635.00 - 2640.00] P:1875.23 E:0.024792 |  nevertheless, it still took a devastating finish from Marquisio. And it left
[2640.00 - 2646.00] P:1840.17 E:0.023207 |  Johart absolutely helpless. Now can England respond? Here goes Daniel
[2646.00 - 2651.00] P:1892.89 E:0.024422 |  Sturridge down this near side. So many times in recent tournaments England go
[2651.00 - 2654.00] P:1833.66 E:0.022624 |  in front even though they don't necessarily win their opening games. They
[2654.00 - 2658.00] P:1728.43 E:0.024476 |  normally score first. It's a long time since England conceded the first goal
[2658.00 - 2662.00] P:1697.82 E:0.025442 |  in a tournament. In fact, I think it might have even been 1988, that European
[2662.00 - 2666.00] P:1754.89 E:0.026011 |  Championship when Ray Halton scored the Republic of Ireland. Don't remember
[2666.00 - 2670.00] P:1723.61 E:0.025211 |  them being behind since then in an opening game. And now it's all to do,
[2670.00 - 2674.00] P:1747.18 E:0.026022 |  Danny. Well, it is. It was a very well-worked set-piece corner routine,
[2674.00 - 2679.00] P:1761.42 E:0.024456 |  short corner, then played into Perlow who had no intention of touching the
[2679.00 - 2683.00] P:1768.56 E:0.024312 |  ball, let it to Marquisio and shot like an absolute arrow into the corner.
[2683.00 - 2687.00] P:1759.65 E:0.023748 |  Johart, no real chance with that. But I have to say, it's again, it's these
[2687.00 - 2691.00] P:1825.21 E:0.026329 |  problems down England's left-hand side. And Candreva had it and this time
[2691.00 - 2694.00] P:1788.14 E:0.026105 |  didn't release Dami and he was available down the right-hand side. There
[2694.00 - 2697.00] P:1747.86 E:0.024501 |  wouldn't have been anyone from England there to cut it out. Well, the Italians
[2697.00 - 2700.00] P:1811.45 E:0.028038 |  have had a really poor build-up to the World Cup. But now England go forward
[2700.00 - 2704.00] P:1876.76 E:0.029232 |  and Rooney is onside. Boar played into Sturridge. It's an equaliser for
[2704.00 - 2710.00] P:1857.07 E:0.029019 |  England. Great break down the left-hand side. Rooney delivered. Sturridge was
[2710.00 - 2715.00] P:1834.09 E:0.028807 |  there. Stephen Jarrar believes he can write up this World Cup. He scored. It's
[2715.00 - 2719.00] P:1876.23 E:0.027570 |  one-one. The perfect response from Daniel Sturridge. Great break from Wayne
[2719.00 - 2724.00] P:1831.11 E:0.027695 |  Rooney down the left-hand side. A brilliant cross in. Just put the ball
[2724.00 - 2729.00] P:1798.62 E:0.026599 |  into space. Daniel Sturridge gambling. Getting there at the back post. Not
[2729.00 - 2733.00] P:1765.67 E:0.026367 |  an easy finish. Bounced up in front of him but right foot into the back of
[2733.00 - 2738.00] P:1806.80 E:0.025399 |  the net. What is that? Two minutes that Italy led for. Fantastic. What a ball
[2738.00 - 2742.00] P:1827.33 E:0.026327 |  in for Wayne Rooney. Bent to the far post with his right foot and a superb
[2742.00 - 2749.00] P:1789.28 E:0.025828 |  finish from Daniel Sturridge. And the players leave the field for a few
[2749.00 - 2754.00] P:1773.94 E:0.025424 |  drinks. Daniel Sturridge gets a slap on the hand from Frank Lampard. And the
[2754.00 - 2757.00] P:1805.83 E:0.026938 |  thing about Sturridge, we've mentioned it before, Dami. I mean, he missed goals,
[2757.00 - 2760.00] P:1763.15 E:0.026312 |  didn't he, in that last game against Honduras. But he never gets his head
[2760.00 - 2764.00] P:1769.00 E:0.024848 |  down. He just moves on to the next one. It came to him on the half folly on the
[2764.00 - 2768.00] P:1755.50 E:0.025395 |  right-hand side. Which is very, very awkward. There's something down on the
[2768.00 - 2773.00] P:1691.34 E:0.025042 |  bench. Something serious quite happened. The stretch is out already. Can't quite
[2773.00 - 2778.00] P:1721.22 E:0.026006 |  see what's happening from our TV monitors or who it is. But somebody looks in a
[2778.00 - 2785.00] P:1768.16 E:0.027275 |  bad way. At the moment it's impossible. Is it an England player or is it an
[2785.00 - 2791.00] P:1754.86 E:0.027377 |  Italian player? The cameras have moved away now from that. It's an England player.
[2791.00 - 2796.00] P:1785.22 E:0.025852 |  I can see a white sock. But it's so crowded down there that we can't really
[2796.00 - 2800.00] P:1732.53 E:0.024061 |  see anything else. And whether that happened in the celebrations for the
[2800.00 - 2806.00] P:1698.45 E:0.024436 |  goal, I'm not quite sure. But we're still looking to see what exactly
[2806.00 - 2811.00] P:1709.78 E:0.025180 |  happened. We're just seeing replays of the goal. Brilliant from Wayne Rooney on
[2811.00 - 2816.00] P:1795.78 E:0.024574 |  the counter attack. A half folly from Daniel Sturridge did very, very well.
[2816.00 - 2819.00] P:1799.43 E:0.025503 |  Easily that can bounce up. Hit your shin. Go over the crossbar. Kept his
[2819.00 - 2823.00] P:1756.66 E:0.023045 |  iron up. And the perfect response. I'm just looking to see if it's an
[2823.00 - 2827.00] P:1716.31 E:0.025752 |  England player on the field who's been injured. But I'm just looking to see
[2827.00 - 2830.00] P:1710.99 E:0.025494 |  they all seem to be out there. So maybe it's one of the substitutes down there
[2830.00 - 2834.00] P:1723.10 E:0.026291 |  who, and the leg brace has been applied apparently. And we still can't see who
[2834.00 - 2838.00] P:1707.45 E:0.025033 |  it is because all the trainers and the doctors are covering the player.
[2838.00 - 2841.00] P:1799.55 E:0.026229 |  Let's get a verdict on that goal from Chris Waddle who's watching with us
[2841.00 - 2845.00] P:1665.25 E:0.028163 |  tonight, Chris. It was a wonderful goal. Wayne Rooney's not playing
[2845.00 - 2849.00] P:1687.04 E:0.025540 |  wade enough when we lose the ball. But it works sometimes. The fullback's
[2849.00 - 2852.00] P:1522.99 E:0.027031 |  gone on. Wayne really hasn't gone with him, which he hasn't on a lot of
[2852.00 - 2855.00] P:1645.41 E:0.024937 |  occasions today. But it played off his team. He found the space. Wonderful
[2855.00 - 2861.00] P:1771.66 E:0.022274 |  ball. Wonderful finish. Thank you very much indeed, Chris. And the
[2861.00 - 2865.00] P:1734.18 E:0.026621 |  rumours are that it's the physio Gary Lewin. It is Gary Lewin who's been
[2865.00 - 2868.00] P:1750.62 E:0.024802 |  carried off on the stretcher. He's the man, of course, who normally comes on
[2868.00 - 2872.00] P:1772.03 E:0.024848 |  the field to treat players. One of the most potty of the people in the camp.
[2872.00 - 2877.00] P:1737.20 E:0.025700 |  I mean, you'll know him, Danny. Well, that is awful for Gary Lewin, obviously.
[2877.00 - 2880.00] P:1694.01 E:0.023947 |  Physio here, you know, been around England set up for such a long time.
[2880.00 - 2884.00] P:1675.14 E:0.023762 |  We did so many tournaments, so experienced about getting the players fit.
[2884.00 - 2887.00] P:1693.15 E:0.024687 |  But he's obviously done himself some serious damage as he gets carried off
[2887.00 - 2890.00] P:1710.05 E:0.025637 |  on a stretcher. Well, we have no idea how it happened, whether he was
[2890.00 - 2894.00] P:1727.99 E:0.024807 |  celebrating and twisted and fell or whether people ran into him. But anyway,
[2894.00 - 2898.00] P:1714.21 E:0.025858 |  he's been carried off on a stretcher. And England are now at 1-1 here.
[2898.00 - 2902.00] P:1706.94 E:0.025144 |  And it's a really entertaining game. And Raheem Sturdy now played a very
[2902.00 - 2906.00] P:1781.71 E:0.026657 |  difficult ball to Wellbeck on the edge of the area. This is always the danger
[2906.00 - 2909.00] P:1825.17 E:0.024635 |  now for England as the opposition counterattack. And it's ballateli down
[2909.00 - 2913.00] P:1774.84 E:0.024531 |  this left-hand side, just holding the ball sensibly because nobody really
[2913.00 - 2917.00] P:1680.85 E:0.025318 |  in a position to receive from it. England won, Italy won. I think five
[2917.00 - 2920.00] P:1829.55 E:0.023704 |  minutes to go in the first half. I think that equaliser, Mike, just goes to
[2920.00 - 2924.00] P:1800.02 E:0.023910 |  show that the Italian back four doesn't have a great deal of pace. You know,
[2924.00 - 2927.00] P:1740.38 E:0.022880 |  if Rooney can get to run at them, Sterling, Sturridge, England have a great
[2927.00 - 2931.00] P:1731.27 E:0.026072 |  opportunity to go on. But there are concerns, always offside,
[2931.00 - 2935.00] P:1783.11 E:0.024356 |  Candrava. But there are concerns every time Italy build quickly down that
[2935.00 - 2939.00] P:1702.88 E:0.022634 |  right-hand side. They seem to be outnumbering veins at times, Candrava
[2939.00 - 2945.00] P:1652.73 E:0.022956 |  and Damien, the fullback. But of course, Damien, we've been congratulating him
[2945.00 - 2949.00] P:1697.95 E:0.025447 |  going forward, but it was in his area where Rooney crossed to lay on the
[2949.00 - 2954.00] P:1731.40 E:0.023293 |  equaliser for Sturridge. So, Italy having now to get back behind the ball. Rooney,
[2954.00 - 2958.00] P:1688.65 E:0.024373 |  one-one, Marquisio for Italy. They led for a couple of minutes and then Sturridge
[2958.00 - 2962.00] P:1697.41 E:0.024670 |  equalised. All played well by Rooney into Henderson. He's got a bit of space.
[2962.00 - 2966.00] P:1721.61 E:0.024077 |  Henderson drove the ball straight at Verratti. Henderson now looked to try and
[2966.00 - 2969.00] P:1732.28 E:0.023179 |  find Johnson down this near-side. Italians haven't dealt with this yet.
[2969.00 - 2973.00] P:1784.41 E:0.024810 |  Henderson almost sneaked in there against Verratti. And England need to apply the
[2973.00 - 2976.00] P:1873.64 E:0.027353 |  pressure even more so. And they do. They steal the ball off Chiellini. It was
[2976.00 - 2980.00] P:1824.13 E:0.023590 |  well-backed. Back again to the goal scorer, Sturridge. England now with
[2980.00 - 2985.00] P:1747.00 E:0.024429 |  Sturridge working the ball back into his own half. And Jagiolka moves it on to
[2985.00 - 2990.00] P:1690.11 E:0.025131 |  Steven Gerard. Banes now, far side the left. Five-live. The World Cup from
[2990.00 - 2994.00] P:1817.63 E:0.025146 |  Brazil. Three and a half minutes to go in the first half. Stirling now, moving
[2994.00 - 2998.00] P:1848.85 E:0.024855 |  through midfield. Immediately the blue shirt surrounding him. Stirling still.
[2998.00 - 3001.00] P:1760.40 E:0.025211 |  Stirling now, finding Banes. No England player in the area yet. The ball is
[3001.00 - 3005.00] P:1763.64 E:0.024594 |  chipped in towards Rooney. And out comes the man in orange. Sirigou the goalkeeper
[3005.00 - 3010.00] P:1705.10 E:0.023915 |  and the danger on again potentially now. As Perlo finds the Italian goal scorer
[3010.00 - 3015.00] P:1653.16 E:0.024103 |  Marquisio. Now Balotelli taking up some good positions. He's now on this left-hand
[3015.00 - 3019.00] P:1593.61 E:0.023834 |  side. Balotelli, no great pace about the Italians here. Just biding their time as
[3019.00 - 3024.00] P:1573.21 E:0.023438 |  ever. Trying to recover from conceding the goal. And remember, I did say after
[3024.00 - 3028.00] P:1701.03 E:0.025334 |  they'd scored the goal, they haven't had a great build-up to this World Cup. But
[3028.00 - 3031.00] P:1725.77 E:0.024316 |  this is, of course, where it really counts. And here they go again. And again,
[3031.00 - 3036.00] P:1745.56 E:0.025572 |  they're standing off Candrava down the right-hand side. Ball in. And that's away
[3036.00 - 3041.00] P:1784.42 E:0.025019 |  by England. By Jagiolka. Rooney's now in the left-back position. They really are
[3041.00 - 3044.00] P:1756.82 E:0.023077 |  going to have to sort that out. And I'm sure Gary Neville, who's part of the
[3044.00 - 3047.00] P:1770.14 E:0.022447 |  coaching staff, will want to talk about that during half-time. Because that is a
[3047.00 - 3052.00] P:1713.32 E:0.023932 |  real cause for concern down that Italian right-hand side. Rooney. Still inside
[3052.00 - 3056.00] P:1821.48 E:0.025628 |  his own half. Rooney tries to float it to this near side. It could turn out to be
[3056.00 - 3060.00] P:1814.97 E:0.025738 |  a beautiful ball. Oh, Stirlig let it bounce. Oh, that was a mistake. Because
[3060.00 - 3063.00] P:1838.81 E:0.026306 |  it's gone out of play. The problem that England have done that left-hand side is
[3063.00 - 3067.00] P:1787.94 E:0.025377 |  Candrava is the most furthest player forward for Italy. Almost playing it
[3067.00 - 3071.00] P:1754.66 E:0.024535 |  inside right. Wayne Rooney's not quite sure, you know, whether to drop deep or
[3071.00 - 3075.00] P:1582.80 E:0.023721 |  whether to stay in his hole. Layton Baines doesn't want to go in tight. And
[3075.00 - 3079.00] P:1591.80 E:0.025921 |  of course, you've got Damian Overlapham down that right-hand side. And that means
[3079.00 - 3083.00] P:1603.37 E:0.024646 |  Layton Baines is outnumbered. Wayne Rooney could go forward. Exceptional cross
[3083.00 - 3088.00] P:1612.95 E:0.025330 |  with his left foot. But they've got to sort out that left-hand side. Because at
[3088.00 - 3092.00] P:1638.65 E:0.026626 |  the moment England have become exposed far too often. It's a sort of area where
[3092.00 - 3098.00] P:1542.55 E:0.024605 |  they might require a James Milner. Possibly. Although that would of course
[3098.00 - 3102.00] P:1692.41 E:0.024969 |  nullify their attacking ability as well. But anyway, it's 1-1 now, moving towards
[3102.00 - 3106.00] P:1739.01 E:0.024323 |  half-time. Marquisio following a short corner for Italy. England with an equaliser
[3106.00 - 3109.00] P:1708.07 E:0.024849 |  from Sturridge. Now the cross will come in from the right-hand side. And Joe Hart
[3109.00 - 3113.00] P:1842.02 E:0.024973 |  is there. Almost collides with Gary Cahill. Hart takes the ball and rolls the ball
[3113.00 - 3117.00] P:1702.60 E:0.023096 |  out of the area. Stirlig has to be careful not to lose this now. Stirlig to Rooney
[3117.00 - 3121.00] P:1702.12 E:0.024233 |  playing in this deep position. Rooney across the field for Glenn Johnson. England
[3121.00 - 3125.00] P:1753.58 E:0.024468 |  predominantly keeping it short on the ground. But just at time, hitting these
[3125.00 - 3129.00] P:1601.42 E:0.025051 |  long part. And then as they strike that long ball forward, it's innocuous. And it's
[3129.00 - 3132.00] P:1677.16 E:0.026606 |  straight through to Syragun. So one thing that you must never do against an Italian
[3132.00 - 3137.00] P:1696.47 E:0.024122 |  side, just concede possession so cheaply. Closing in on half-time here. Gary
[3137.00 - 3141.00] P:1697.16 E:0.024929 |  Lewin though, the England physio has been carried from the stadium on a stretcher.
[3141.00 - 3146.00] P:1590.21 E:0.024359 |  After the, it seems the goal celebrations following Sturridge's equaliser. Here
[3146.00 - 3149.00] P:1754.72 E:0.028324 |  they go again. Down at right-hand side. More danger for England as Damien goes
[3149.00 - 3154.00] P:1865.05 E:0.026669 |  forward and strikes it in the end over the bar. But they have to sort this out. This
[3154.00 - 3158.00] P:1852.80 E:0.025923 |  is a real problem. Leighton-Baines is getting isolated. That time Damien cut
[3158.00 - 3163.00] P:1770.37 E:0.025553 |  inside. I think again it was Candreva that made an overlapping run. Leighton-Baines
[3163.00 - 3168.00] P:1711.52 E:0.023591 |  getting caught two on one. Not quite sure whether to stick or twist. Had that been
[3168.00 - 3172.00] P:1664.90 E:0.021565 |  a better shot, Joe Hart might have been in trouble. But it's difficult for Leighton-Baines
[3172.00 - 3176.00] P:1545.06 E:0.024633 |  at the moment because he's been exposed. He needs more help on that left-hand side
[3176.00 - 3180.00] P:1599.68 E:0.021753 |  and Roy Hodgson is definitely going to have to do something tactically about that
[3180.00 - 3184.00] P:1667.98 E:0.026056 |  for the second half. Well, we can see it from here. I'm sure they can see it from
[3184.00 - 3189.00] P:1748.82 E:0.022516 |  down there. Fingland want to get something from this game. That's an area that they
[3189.00 - 3193.00] P:1786.11 E:0.022533 |  have to sort out during half-time. Ball is thrown out to the defender, Paletta,
[3193.00 - 3198.00] P:1697.82 E:0.022743 |  who's only winning his third cap. On to the vast experience, Kylini. Fourth
[3198.00 - 3203.00] P:1652.77 E:0.023890 |  official is coming forward now to indicate the added time. And it has very much the
[3203.00 - 3206.00] P:1724.51 E:0.023959 |  end of a first half look at it at the moment. The sides may be just looking forward
[3206.00 - 3210.00] P:1666.83 E:0.023513 |  now to getting into the cool of the dressing room. The ball is again endlessly
[3210.00 - 3214.00] P:1705.20 E:0.022408 |  down that right-hand side. This time though Damien doesn't cut forward. He plays it
[3214.00 - 3220.00] P:1615.13 E:0.026600 |  into midfield and Verratti. Verratti inside the centre circle. Still Verratti.
[3220.00 - 3224.00] P:1708.78 E:0.026364 |  England just backing off. Verratti now two minutes of added time. I think we're
[3224.00 - 3229.00] P:1729.59 E:0.022237 |  going to have here. Still Italy building. De Rossi over to the right-hand side.
[3229.00 - 3235.00] P:1657.99 E:0.021675 |  Now it's Candrava into De Rossi once more. De Rossi's short pass into Perla. Back
[3235.00 - 3239.00] P:1813.88 E:0.025382 |  again to De Rossi. Now Marquisio's ball towards Balotelli and thumped away by
[3239.00 - 3243.00] P:1780.37 E:0.023014 |  England. It mustn't lose the ball here inside their own half. And it's played by
[3243.00 - 3248.00] P:1702.74 E:0.023540 |  Henderson and England are getting just stuck here a little bit. Now it's Johnson.
[3248.00 - 3253.00] P:1698.14 E:0.023226 |  Johnson finding Welbeck near side the England right. Back again to Johnson.
[3253.00 - 3257.00] P:1647.56 E:0.025458 |  Now it's time to get through the half time here now. And some encouraging words
[3257.00 - 3261.00] P:1631.59 E:0.024712 |  I'm sure from Roy Hodgson. But also he's going to have a problem to sort out at
[3261.00 - 3265.00] P:1699.04 E:0.024322 |  half time. Layton Baines again over on the left-hand side. Now Ashley Cole of course
[3265.00 - 3269.00] P:1602.35 E:0.023042 |  in this tournament. And Baines has had quite a world cup baptism here against
[3269.00 - 3273.00] P:1627.09 E:0.023413 |  Italy down the right-hand side. They do seem to be targeting him as well.
[3273.00 - 3277.00] P:1761.98 E:0.025152 |  Gerard now hits the ball across. It doesn't reach. Doesn't reach Welbeck. Marquisio
[3277.00 - 3281.00] P:1770.83 E:0.023494 |  cuts it out. Perlo switches it back. So we're in added time about 50 seconds to go
[3281.00 - 3285.00] P:1703.42 E:0.023826 |  to the half time whistle. England won Italy one on five live. Verratti on to
[3285.00 - 3289.00] P:1865.61 E:0.027718 |  Perlo. Perlo looking to release Balotelli in the area. Out comes Johar. He doesn't
[3289.00 - 3294.00] P:1841.53 E:0.027639 |  get there. Balotelli from the angle. Balotelli tries to kick Johar headed away
[3294.00 - 3300.00] P:1888.77 E:0.028613 |  by England by Jagi Elka. Almost on half time Italy score. First time that Balotelli
[3300.00 - 3304.00] P:1876.21 E:0.026896 |  has really been in the game. Again it's that little slide rule ball down the side
[3304.00 - 3310.00] P:1731.48 E:0.025822 |  from Andro Perlo. Johar did well. Came out, forced Balotelli away. And they're
[3310.00 - 3314.00] P:1719.62 E:0.024166 |  a clever little dink over the top. Nearly went in but Jagi Elka are off the line.
[3314.00 - 3318.00] P:1805.51 E:0.026461 |  Another short corner and they found Perlo on the edge of the area. Verratti now.
[3318.00 - 3323.00] P:1838.95 E:0.027450 |  Another maybe chance for Marquisio. Marquisio chips into the area. There's danger here.
[3323.00 - 3328.00] P:1844.09 E:0.028268 |  The shot is driven in against the post by Cairn Draver. England need the half time
[3328.00 - 3332.00] P:1773.62 E:0.025936 |  whistle. We're playing added time at the end of the first half. England are
[3332.00 - 3335.00] P:1890.72 E:0.028186 |  hanging on here at the end of the first half. And then there's Samarji Bagi on
[3335.00 - 3339.00] P:1827.70 E:0.026296 |  the edge of the area. And the referee may well now decide to blow for half time.
[3339.00 - 3344.00] P:1882.58 E:0.027616 |  Rather than trying to sort that out. So what an eventful first half. England won
[3344.00 - 3349.00] P:1919.26 E:0.028440 |  Italy one. Down to Ian Dennis Kipsy. Just seeing Johar and Mario Balotelli
[3349.00 - 3353.00] P:1912.86 E:0.026643 |  have just playfully barged into each other. And then the respective arms go
[3353.00 - 3356.00] P:1829.32 E:0.025867 |  around each other's shoulders. And little handshake as well from the two
[3356.00 - 3360.00] P:1858.18 E:0.024844 |  former Manchester City colleagues. England then were like boxes on the ropes
[3360.00 - 3364.00] P:1817.48 E:0.027887 |  towards the latter stages of that first half. And Phil Jagi Elka looked tired.
[3364.00 - 3370.00] P:1812.37 E:0.026292 |  His white shirt drenched so tight with sweat. But it was mentally alert to get
[3370.00 - 3374.00] P:1722.26 E:0.028575 |  back to have that ball off the line. And just one other point as I was behind
[3374.00 - 3377.00] P:1597.72 E:0.028647 |  that goal. This is the end where England are going to be attacking in the
[3377.00 - 3381.00] P:1631.22 E:0.030031 |  second half. And the pitch is cutting up. And there are two areas. One just in
[3381.00 - 3385.00] P:1809.56 E:0.024703 |  front of the base of the left hand post. And another one on the left hand side.
[3385.00 - 3388.00] P:1924.02 E:0.024782 |  And if you can imagine a birthday cake and how you peel off the marzipan.
[3388.00 - 3393.00] P:1803.91 E:0.024374 |  That is how the pitch is starting to lift in those two areas. Mark Pugac.
[3393.00 - 3397.00] P:1691.64 E:0.024824 |  And that is how you get back to the table. And then the pitch is going to
[3397.00 - 3400.00] P:1777.35 E:0.025547 |  be over. And that is how you get back to the table. And you get a little
[3400.00 - 3404.00] P:1750.32 E:0.023503 |  bit of a surprise. Thank you, Ian. Just spotted it with Chris Waddle
[3404.00 - 3407.00] P:1766.99 E:0.023614 |  and myself at Stephen Gerald, who I think would have probably changed his
[3407.00 - 3411.00] P:1712.84 E:0.021726 |  shirt anyway at halftime. It is so drenched in sweat. Gave his shirt to
[3411.00 - 3414.00] P:1673.45 E:0.024497 |  an Italian as they walked up the tunnel at halftime. But try and bring
[3414.00 - 3418.00] P:1673.01 E:0.022528 |  you some news about Gary Lewin, who we can only suspect in celebrating,
[3418.00 - 3421.00] P:1680.53 E:0.025421 |  clearly did something to his ankle or his leg. But it was very serious
[3421.00 - 3425.00] P:1758.28 E:0.026386 |  when he was playing for the team. And the ball was in the middle of the
[3425.00 - 3429.00] P:1661.12 E:0.024081 |  line. And the right side is not too bad. Daniel Welbeck is doing a good
[3429.00 - 3433.00] P:1659.80 E:0.024494 |  job with Kear, but probably in runes. He can't play many positions. But
[3433.00 - 3437.00] P:1739.28 E:0.025179 |  he likes to play that number 10 role, doesn't he? And he is getting, when
[3437.00 - 3440.00] P:1650.72 E:0.024256 |  we lose the ball, England is coming into two narrow. And it is an easy
[3440.00 - 3443.00] P:1543.07 E:0.025721 |  outboard for Peerle. Anybody could hit the right back. Letting bins know
[3443.00 - 3447.00] P:1640.42 E:0.021400 |  where they are going on the wing or the way, or the fullback. He has got to
[3447.00 - 3450.00] P:1702.19 E:0.023602 |  back off. And that is why we can't get any sustained pressure on Italy. And
[3450.00 - 3454.00] P:1818.36 E:0.019787 |  that is why we are going to have to get the ball up the tempo of the game
[3454.00 - 3458.00] P:1699.93 E:0.024941 |  20-25%. We could cause a lot more problems. This is the issue where
[3458.00 - 3462.00] P:1723.19 E:0.022650 |  Wayne Rooney has to sacrifice his natural game and what he wants to do for
[3462.00 - 3465.00] P:1696.02 E:0.028375 |  the good of the team, isn't it? Yeah. He has got, he has got, as soon as he
[3465.00 - 3468.00] P:1758.84 E:0.023772 |  loses it, he has got to be thinking about the left side of midfielder. I am
[3468.00 - 3472.00] P:1794.83 E:0.022887 |  not in number 10. Stirling is playing in the, I put Stirling out, because
[3472.00 - 3476.00] P:1748.93 E:0.021719 |  he is still fullback. I put Stirling out on that left wing against the right
[3476.00 - 3480.00] P:1809.89 E:0.019760 |  wing. I think it has gone relatively well. There is a problem for Leighton
[3480.00 - 3484.00] P:1791.30 E:0.024749 |  Baines down that right-hand side. Can Draver, as I said, play in an inside
[3484.00 - 3488.00] P:1835.85 E:0.023308 |  right position, getting in between the lines, in between where Wayne Rooney
[3488.00 - 3492.00] P:1815.64 E:0.023593 |  doesn't want to be, and Leighton Baines, and then Damien going down that left
[3492.00 - 3496.00] P:1864.01 E:0.023497 |  hand side. I think England have played okay. They have done pretty well. They
[3496.00 - 3500.00] P:1803.33 E:0.023455 |  would be delighted to get back in the game so quickly. A great ball in from
[3500.00 - 3504.00] P:1773.90 E:0.023998 |  Wayne Rooney. Italy, especially with Peerle, are looking for balls over the
[3504.00 - 3508.00] P:1853.05 E:0.020752 |  left wing. They have got a little through balls in the final third. That is
[3508.00 - 3512.00] P:1879.92 E:0.022776 |  definitely a tactic and a ploy of theirs. And really, England should be able to
[3512.00 - 3516.00] P:1838.33 E:0.025105 |  defend with that. It is purely down to concentration. They have just got to
[3516.00 - 3520.00] P:1870.87 E:0.021227 |  keep, know where all the players are, keep marking them, be on the toes for the
[3520.00 - 3522.00] P:1885.56 E:0.018428 |  1994th minute.
[3522.00 - 3525.00] P:1689.08 E:0.027002 |  Danny, thank you for now. Go and have a drink at halftime as we are watching the
[3525.00 - 3528.00] P:1494.62 E:0.027516 |  replay, Chris, of the goal. We were so worried about Peerle being on the ball,
[3528.00 - 3532.00] P:1713.87 E:0.023334 |  and what he would do on the ball, put us Peerle do a beautiful dummy, which
[3532.00 - 3544.00] P:1602.78 E:0.021211 |  being off and turning him into the scorekeeper in Germany and Harry
[3544.00 - 3544.88] P:1416.98 E:0.026037 |  Lighthouse. It was a good strike.
[3544.88 - 3548.00] P:1612.55 E:0.020118 |  Ootlty, Ringgit and Ricky Coal, fantastic dummy. It was a good骆ed,
[3548.00 - 3552.00] P:1543.24 E:0.020538 |  went through a lot of bodies, Joel Hart could not really say it. It was a good
[3552.00 - 3554.00] P:1630.55 E:0.025835 |  finish.
[3554.00 - 3557.00] P:1598.86 E:0.021489 |  I mean, you look at the two teams in England. If they can play a little
[3557.00 - 3560.00] P:1642.23 E:0.020917 |  bit quicker, especially when you get possession deep, you want them to
[3560.00 - 3564.00] P:1745.61 E:0.026626 |  the left-hand side. It's a fabulous cross, the shape of it,
[3564.00 - 3568.00] P:1754.21 E:0.022759 |  coming back in towards Sturridge. He's too quick for Kaleeni, the
[3568.00 - 3572.00] P:1550.70 E:0.023286 |  fullback, who just cannot keep up with him, why Sturridge has that
[3572.00 - 3576.00] P:1658.44 E:0.022916 |  opportunity. And actually, he has to judge the bounce of the ball,
[3576.00 - 3580.00] P:1559.59 E:0.026067 |  doesn't he, and shape his body accordingly. It's been very easy to
[3580.00 - 3584.00] P:1436.81 E:0.020440 |  spoon that over the top. He's got perfect contact on it.
[3584.00 - 3588.00] P:1470.97 E:0.021362 |  He's got a great season with Liverpool, he gives them the chances,
[3588.00 - 3592.00] P:1562.80 E:0.018427 |  and I just think, England's at the minute,
[3592.00 - 3596.00] P:1540.66 E:0.020302 |  there's a big fear factor. With Italy as well,
[3596.00 - 3600.00] P:1399.81 E:0.024214 |  I'm very happy with the pace of the game. Because they've got older players,
[3600.00 - 3604.00] P:1547.82 E:0.022816 |  they want to play slow. And because of the conditions, maybe, obviously, England must
[3604.00 - 3608.00] P:1808.65 E:0.023388 |  think we can't chase at Harris as much as we want, which is suitably, because of the
[3608.00 - 3611.00] P:1722.54 E:0.022442 |  pace of the game, they're dictating. And if England doesn't say, just raise the
[3611.00 - 3615.00] P:1706.27 E:0.022562 |  tempo, even for the first 20 minutes, you may get your noses in front, and that may be enough.
[3615.00 - 3619.00] P:1738.89 E:0.027516 |  But you would say, you have to say to Wayne Rooney, play, you have to play wider,
[3619.00 - 3621.00] P:1791.65 E:0.018908 |  and you have to come back and help Leighton Baines.
[3621.00 - 3625.00] P:1766.16 E:0.023510 |  Just come on left side, you've got the full back, unless you get a shot to let
[3625.00 - 3629.00] P:1607.70 E:0.022400 |  him come on, tuck in side, number seven or eight, wherever it is, go and say,
[3629.00 - 3632.00] P:1439.16 E:0.024652 |  I'll take the full back, you get a shot on Leighton Baines. But at the minute, he's going in there,
[3632.00 - 3635.00] P:1576.88 E:0.024712 |  there's nobody to mark, so the full back's just on his back, Leighton Baines has been
[3635.00 - 3639.00] P:1559.31 E:0.023404 |  attracted by the lad playing inside, and he's getting an easy ball out for Italy
[3639.00 - 3642.00] P:1552.73 E:0.024785 |  every time. Yeah, they've got two on one on Baines every time, and Pirlo, who's just
[3642.00 - 3645.00] P:1736.22 E:0.026278 |  so good at just like a little lob wedge, isn't he? Just dropping it over his head
[3645.00 - 3648.00] P:1641.35 E:0.023109 |  onto whoever is running outside of Leighton Baines. Let's go to Juliet
[3648.00 - 3652.00] P:1848.27 E:0.024280 |  Farrington, who's down on the beach here in Rio. Yeah, two and a half miles away
[3652.00 - 3657.00] P:2009.90 E:0.022840 |  from you, around 20,000 fans inside. The Italians are being absolutely outnumbered
[3657.00 - 3661.00] P:2076.96 E:0.019553 |  here tonight with the England fans. We've got Matt, we've got Dennis Matt. How are
[3661.00 - 3665.00] P:2068.98 E:0.021020 |  you feeling towards the end of that first 45? Please, we got in with the draw at
[3665.00 - 3670.00] P:1909.37 E:0.022446 |  the end, one-all. First half an hour, I thought we were fantastic. Really positive
[3670.00 - 3675.00] P:2007.45 E:0.022620 |  team selection and to the start, peppered the goal with long-range shots. Didn't
[3675.00 - 3679.00] P:2038.22 E:0.024589 |  deserve to go one-nil down and a fantastic response going back. Really didn't do
[3679.00 - 3683.00] P:1957.33 E:0.025015 |  a lot, but brilliant cross to Starridge, who showed that what he did against
[3683.00 - 3687.00] P:1978.97 E:0.023436 |  Honduras wasn't his usual form, and he's banged it in the back of the net, back
[3687.00 - 3691.00] P:1873.55 E:0.023450 |  to one-all. Right at the end, maybe he could have let another one in, but so
[3691.00 - 3695.00] P:1831.19 E:0.025648 |  one-all's good at halftime, push on to second half, and we can make it a win,
[3695.00 - 3699.00] P:1920.89 E:0.024166 |  and especially after Costa Rica result, and they hope to top the group before
[3699.00 - 3704.00] P:1927.44 E:0.023639 |  the next round. And Dennis, we all thought Stirling's effort was in, wasn't
[3704.00 - 3708.00] P:2040.36 E:0.025798 |  we? There was beer all over the place. So did I. But I'll tell you what, Stirling's
[3708.00 - 3712.00] P:1973.23 E:0.023940 |  the key to this game. He's looking alive, he's looking very, very dangerous. Roy
[3712.00 - 3716.00] P:1971.45 E:0.025415 |  Hodgson, very good selection point, Stirling in, he's looked really, really
[3716.00 - 3720.00] P:2092.92 E:0.021084 |  dangerous. Right, we've got the bar behind me, I'll let you go back to you, Mark.
[3720.00 - 3724.00] P:1772.21 E:0.026341 |  Thank you very much indeed. Now Dan Walker, who is also pitch-side there in
[3724.00 - 3729.00] P:1716.68 E:0.023865 |  Manaus, has tweeted that, what happened with Gary Lewin, the England physio,
[3729.00 - 3732.00] P:1614.44 E:0.025543 |  Dan's tweeted, Gary Lewin flew off the bench along with the rest of the
[3732.00 - 3736.00] P:1646.70 E:0.023831 |  England staff after the goal, immediately collapsed and started banging the
[3736.00 - 3740.00] P:1565.70 E:0.022080 |  ground, obviously in pain. And that's what we saw, and we wanted who it was, we
[3740.00 - 3743.00] P:1620.72 E:0.022899 |  thought he was an England player to start with, but actually it was the physio
[3743.00 - 3747.00] P:1624.77 E:0.022719 |  himself, Gary Lewin, so we wish him the very, very best. But clearly he's done
[3747.00 - 3750.00] P:1206.23 E:0.024152 |  something, it would seem pretty significant to his leg or his ankle or
[3750.00 - 3754.00] P:1610.26 E:0.023177 |  whatever it is, will bring you news as soon as we get that. Chris, in this
[3754.00 - 3757.00] P:1967.70 E:0.024387 |  halftime, I know Stephen Gerald's changed shirts already, but you've changed
[3757.00 - 3761.00] P:1712.84 E:0.023336 |  shirts, don't you? You try and get a drink on board. Do you have a shower?
[3761.00 - 3765.00] P:1506.11 E:0.022993 |  Seriously, do you have a cold shower? No, basically you lie there, you'll get your
[3765.00 - 3769.00] P:1581.43 E:0.024703 |  legs up, trying to get them loose again, and anyway you can't cool yourself
[3769.00 - 3772.00] P:1686.33 E:0.023323 |  down, there'll be ace pucks on the back of the necks, on the legs, there's
[3772.00 - 3775.00] P:1723.30 E:0.022057 |  listen, everything you can think of will be in that change room, trying to cool
[3775.00 - 3778.00] P:1721.55 E:0.025026 |  them down. I just, as I say, it's very difficult, it's easier to sit in there
[3778.00 - 3781.00] P:1465.61 E:0.023042 |  and talk about it, but it is very hard in England, like the player high
[3781.00 - 3784.00] P:1662.83 E:0.019355 |  tempo, unfortunately the conditions are obviously stifling and it's too
[3784.00 - 3787.00] P:1505.01 E:0.027033 |  nearly. And England, well, the England medical staff will be working overtime
[3787.00 - 3790.00] P:1385.65 E:0.023395 |  because they're one man down, sadly. We sent Gary Lewin our very best wishes,
[3790.00 - 3793.00] P:1733.63 E:0.026865 |  we'll let you know what the situation is with him as we go to the newsroom

[4025.16 - 4027.16] P:1693.38 E:0.020070 |  Richard, these latest stories
[4027.16 - 4029.16] P:1770.85 E:0.025526 |  claim that FIFA executives were
[4029.16 - 4031.16] P:1707.69 E:0.022330 |  in the middle of the
[4031.16 - 4033.16] P:1667.51 E:0.024031 |  election.
[4033.16 - 4035.16] P:1518.83 E:0.017641 |  What are the concerns?

[4039.16 - 4041.16] P:1735.46 E:0.022680 |  What are the concerns?
[4041.16 - 4043.16] P:1729.02 E:0.020326 |  Sunday times saying tonight
[4043.16 - 4045.16] P:1818.59 E:0.020074 |  they have a report, an internal
[4045.16 - 4047.16] P:1644.03 E:0.022890 |  FIFA report, which was
[4047.16 - 4049.16] P:1748.24 E:0.019340 |  commissioned by General Secretary
[4049.16 - 4051.16] P:1747.73 E:0.019566 |  Jerome Valk just weeks before
[4051.16 - 4053.16] P:1729.63 E:0.023891 |  that vote in 2010 on where the
[4053.16 - 4055.16] P:1652.68 E:0.018775 |  2018 and 2022 World Cups would
[4055.16 - 4057.16] P:1609.53 E:0.020424 |  take place.
[4057.16 - 4059.16] P:1698.02 E:0.024512 |  The report was
[4059.16 - 4061.16] P:1682.59 E:0.019740 |  published in the
[4061.16 - 4063.16] P:1778.72 E:0.026388 |  2018 World Cups.
[4063.16 - 4065.16] P:1661.60 E:0.022707 |  The report was
[4065.16 - 4067.16] P:1763.25 E:0.018337 |  cancelled if there was a major
[4067.16 - 4069.16] P:1823.53 E:0.021770 |  terrorist incident.
[4069.16 - 4071.16] P:1526.85 E:0.019505 |  That was because of the close
[4071.16 - 4073.16] P:1479.09 E:0.023732 |  proximity of venues within
[4073.16 - 4075.16] P:1644.54 E:0.022705 |  training facilities, fans of
[4075.16 - 4077.16] P:1692.57 E:0.019943 |  hotels, and that's why they gave
[4077.16 - 4079.16] P:1854.34 E:0.018673 |  it this high risk status.
[4079.16 - 4081.16] P:1645.07 E:0.022824 |  This report, we should
[4081.16 - 4083.16] P:1702.97 E:0.022446 |  probably caution as well, was
[4083.16 - 4085.16] P:1812.42 E:0.020956 |  prepared a very short notice
[4085.16 - 4087.16] P:1760.58 E:0.023676 |  about the challenges faced in
[4087.16 - 4089.16] P:1851.87 E:0.024014 |  getting through a volume of
[4089.16 - 4090.16] P:1842.45 E:0.021301 |  information.
[4090.16 - 4092.16] P:1746.81 E:0.019791 |  He only had one day in which to
[4092.16 - 4093.16] P:1429.73 E:0.021185 |  do that.
[4093.16 - 4095.16] P:1797.36 E:0.022817 |  Nevertheless, this will come
[4095.16 - 4097.16] P:1777.18 E:0.021967 |  on top of those allegations we
[4097.16 - 4099.16] P:1607.16 E:0.018408 |  have seen already against Qatar
[4099.16 - 4101.16] P:1751.14 E:0.021289 |  and it will be a further attack
[4101.16 - 4103.16] P:1680.85 E:0.018236 |  against them and against their
[4103.16 - 4105.16] P:1374.27 E:0.026231 |  suitability to host this World
[4105.16 - 4107.16] P:1687.42 E:0.017228 |  Cup in 2022.
[4107.16 - 4109.16] P:1718.26 E:0.022677 |  Separately, Mark, very briefly,
[4109.16 - 4111.16] P:1830.44 E:0.021284 |  we have also heard from Qatar
[4111.16 - 4113.16] P:1707.67 E:0.020573 |  today, they issued for the first
[4113.16 - 4115.16] P:1497.13 E:0.019874 |  time the allegations that
[4115.16 - 4117.16] P:1634.02 E:0.017342 |  they say were
[4117.16 - 4119.16] P:1622.61 E:0.019731 |  stemmed from Mohammed bin
[4119.16 - 4121.16] P:1595.22 E:0.020912 |  Hamam, Qatar National Hoops,
[4121.16 - 4123.16] P:1790.69 E:0.018804 |  they say paid football officials
[4123.16 - 4125.16] P:1753.19 E:0.023410 |  to support their bid.
[4125.16 - 4127.16] P:1775.15 E:0.018653 |  They say they vehemently deny
[4127.16 - 4129.16] P:1714.84 E:0.024204 |  those allegations and they also
[4129.16 - 4131.16] P:1573.79 E:0.022551 |  talk about how this is a flagrant
[4131.16 - 4133.16] P:1671.63 E:0.020524 |  attempt in there which to
[4133.16 - 4135.16] P:1681.18 E:0.022799 |  prejudice an ongoing independent
[4135.16 - 4137.16] P:1639.93 E:0.020804 |  investigation and that these
[4137.16 - 4139.16] P:1597.45 E:0.021436 |  allegations are baseless and riddled
[4139.16 - 4141.16] P:1551.88 E:0.020876 |  within UNDO.
[4141.16 - 4143.16] P:1638.04 E:0.022463 |  So, I think that's the
[4143.16 - 4145.16] P:1349.49 E:0.021875 |  reason why, if you look at
[4145.16 - 4147.16] P:1333.50 E:0.017770 |  the report, he's concluding his
[4147.16 - 4149.16] P:1816.35 E:0.027543 |  report, we're expecting that in
[4149.16 - 4151.16] P:1403.10 E:0.026434 |  July, the matter will roll on we
[4151.16 - 4153.16] P:1698.95 E:0.021680 |  think until October.
[4153.16 - 4155.16] P:1837.06 E:0.029342 |  Thank you very much, Richard.
[4155.16 - 4157.16] P:1326.29 E:0.025376 |  I know you'll keep across that
[4157.16 - 4159.16] P:1555.99 E:0.024125 |  and all the stories here from the
[4159.16 - 4161.16] P:1243.73 E:0.027302 |  World Cup, one of which sadly
[4161.16 - 4163.16] P:1414.49 E:0.021341 |  concerns the England physio in
[4163.16 - 4165.16] P:1562.51 E:0.028630 |  the injury he suffered in the
[4165.16 - 4167.16] P:1569.56 E:0.029602 |  aftermath of England's equalizer.
[4167.16 - 4169.16] P:1554.76 E:0.029513 |  Ian Dennis, his pitchside in
[4169.16 - 4171.16] P:1501.86 E:0.028719 |  the UK, he's a player who
[4171.16 - 4173.16] P:1451.98 E:0.029669 |  has a very good
[4173.16 - 4175.16] P:1576.08 E:0.029497 |  position.
[4175.16 - 4177.16] P:1638.60 E:0.029382 |  I'm away from my pitchside
[4177.16 - 4179.16] P:1574.16 E:0.029666 |  position.
[4179.16 - 4181.16] P:1451.02 E:0.031246 |  Danny Murphy, who is also
[4181.16 - 4183.16] P:1493.74 E:0.030115 |  pitchside with Gabby
[4183.16 - 4185.16] P:1446.54 E:0.030184 |  Logan, they say he actually
[4185.16 - 4187.16] P:1511.45 E:0.029795 |  saw it and he fears it's a
[4187.16 - 4189.16] P:1601.38 E:0.028941 |  broken ankle.
[4189.16 - 4191.16] P:1452.14 E:0.030903 |  He seems to celebrate and go over
[4191.16 - 4193.16] P:1595.52 E:0.028895 |  on his ankle.
[4193.16 - 4195.16] P:1473.80 E:0.030300 |  They are the fears it might well
[4195.16 - 4197.16] P:1587.00 E:0.027428 |  be a broken ankle but just
[4197.16 - 4199.16] P:1658.14 E:0.032233 |  I'm reading something which says
[4199.16 - 4201.16] P:1400.79 E:0.026611 |  it's the official feed of the
[4201.16 - 4203.16] P:1554.96 E:0.025131 |  England football team.
[4203.16 - 4205.16] P:1480.58 E:0.026269 |  I don't know whether that is
[4205.16 - 4207.16] P:1420.90 E:0.021232 |  official but it's got an FA.com
[4207.16 - 4209.16] P:1297.86 E:0.027385 |  sign on it and quite a few
[4209.16 - 4211.16] P:1334.79 E:0.025471 |  100,000 followers which says
[4211.16 - 4213.16] P:1292.35 E:0.023273 |  that he dislocated his ankle.
[4213.16 - 4215.16] P:1262.70 E:0.030063 |  I think the suggestion is
[4215.16 - 4217.16] P:1450.71 E:0.026413 |  that he fell over
[4217.16 - 4219.16] P:1377.99 E:0.027393 |  some drinks.
[4219.16 - 4221.16] P:1474.67 E:0.025540 |  Obviously there's a big drinks
[4221.16 - 4223.16] P:1359.16 E:0.028259 |  tray there, isn't there?
[4223.16 - 4225.16] P:1483.91 E:0.025638 |  It was very hard for me to see.
[4225.16 - 4227.16] P:1344.04 E:0.029283 |  I spotted the
[4227.16 - 4229.16] P:1425.19 E:0.030084 |  medical people, one of the
[4229.16 - 4231.16] P:1583.73 E:0.030770 |  physios, treating him straight away
[4231.16 - 4233.16] P:1512.98 E:0.028983 |  because what they've got is
[4233.16 - 4235.16] P:1391.70 E:0.031260 |  sky-colored bits and they were
[4235.16 - 4237.16] P:1603.33 E:0.029065 |  quickly on the scene.
[4237.16 - 4239.16] P:1488.82 E:0.029733 |  Because they gathered around him, I
[4239.16 - 4241.16] P:1495.00 E:0.030872 |  couldn't work out who it was.
[4241.16 - 4243.16] P:1521.51 E:0.029866 |  My initial thought was that it was Ray
[4243.16 - 4245.16] P:1781.40 E:0.028949 |  Lewington because Ray Lewington
[4245.16 - 4247.16] P:1615.57 E:0.028382 |  after the Honduras game was on
[4247.16 - 4249.16] P:1612.69 E:0.030788 |  crutches.
[4249.16 - 4251.16] P:1726.51 E:0.028704 |  I don't know what Ray Lewington had
[4251.16 - 4253.16] P:1700.89 E:0.027174 |  done to warrant that but I saw Ray
[4253.16 - 4255.16] P:1657.68 E:0.029329 |  Lewington's thought that it may have been Ray.
[4255.16 - 4257.16] P:1677.92 E:0.029450 |  Gary Lewin with a dislocated ankle.
[4257.16 - 4259.16] P:1750.20 E:0.029477 |  I would imagine that that Twitter feed
[4259.16 - 4261.16] P:1729.52 E:0.029267 |  is the official feed of the FA.
[4261.16 - 4263.16] P:1776.50 E:0.029255 |  I can just make it out.
[4263.16 - 4265.16] P:1734.45 E:0.029290 |  Stephen Gerrard leading England back out
[4265.16 - 4267.16] P:1759.69 E:0.028283 |  as the second half is about to get
[4267.16 - 4269.16] P:1664.91 E:0.030469 |  under way.
[4269.16 - 4271.16] P:1581.77 E:0.030512 |  Those two areas of this pit are
[4271.16 - 4273.16] P:1839.59 E:0.030515 |  going to be attacking in front of me.
[4273.16 - 4275.16] P:1887.07 E:0.031079 |  Mark has now been flattened
[4275.16 - 4277.16] P:1836.23 E:0.028542 |  completely down.
[4277.16 - 4279.16] P:1724.36 E:0.027229 |  As the teams come out, Chris Waddle
[4279.16 - 4281.16] P:1782.48 E:0.022603 |  with a nice exchange between Arun and
[4281.16 - 4283.16] P:1580.55 E:0.025867 |  Waddle.
[4283.16 - 4285.16] P:1388.09 E:0.025813 |  What are your thoughts on the
[4285.16 - 4287.16] P:1610.00 E:0.023519 |  second half?
[4287.16 - 4289.16] P:1654.48 E:0.024703 |  There is a lot of respect between the
[4289.16 - 4291.16] P:1433.52 E:0.022906 |  two.
[4291.16 - 4293.16] P:1048.28 E:0.028013 |  It suits the tempo.
[4293.16 - 4295.16] P:1679.31 E:0.013366 |  You would like to move around a lot
[4295.16 - 4297.16] P:1384.05 E:0.023332 |  more.
[4297.16 - 4299.16] P:1707.64 E:0.023121 |  But the conditions are not helping
[4299.16 - 4301.16] P:1728.32 E:0.020315 |  England.

[4321.16 - 4325.16] P:1682.57 E:0.021873 |  First half.
[4325.16 - 4327.54] P:1739.08 E:0.024625 |  There are no changes in the

[4368.54 - 4369.74] P:1748.87 E:0.026113 |  in front two minutes later.
[4370.06 - 4372.86] P:1798.54 E:0.025275 |  Sturridge equalized for England and here is Daniel
[4373.14 - 4374.86] P:1827.49 E:0.024164 |  Sturridge at the start of this second half.
[4374.98 - 4378.58] P:1766.04 E:0.024201 |  England all in white attacking the end to our left behind
[4378.58 - 4381.38] P:1813.59 E:0.025034 |  which is a huge number of England fans.
[4381.86 - 4383.78] P:1651.23 E:0.026677 |  And they've got a throw in in this near side of the field
[4383.78 - 4384.78] P:1511.65 E:0.018037 |  there left.
[4384.78 - 4385.66] P:1687.91 E:0.024141 |  Banes to take it.
[4385.98 - 4388.70] P:1685.10 E:0.022651 |  If you're right I'm sure Weldbeck will be tracking back
[4388.70 - 4391.82] P:1466.17 E:0.022657 |  and helping out late in Banes much more than Wayne Rooney
[4392.06 - 4393.26] P:1701.27 E:0.022998 |  seemed to be preferred to do.
[4394.02 - 4396.26] P:1637.57 E:0.027456 |  Another throw in is the result is a challenge.
[4396.70 - 4397.70] P:1806.05 E:0.026543 |  came in on Sturridge.
[4397.70 - 4399.98] P:1594.62 E:0.025759 |  Banes to take it live over the edge of the Italian penalty
[4399.98 - 4401.54] P:1554.79 E:0.026730 |  area goes to Weldbeck.
[4401.58 - 4403.70] P:1742.15 E:0.025127 |  Rooney's inside the box so to his Sturridge.
[4404.34 - 4405.14] P:1788.02 E:0.028637 |  Here's Sturling.
[4405.66 - 4408.46] P:1653.85 E:0.023455 |  Sturling moves away from Verati.
[4408.90 - 4411.78] P:1684.59 E:0.023814 |  Beats another Italian player feeds the ball to Weldbeck.
[4411.86 - 4414.18] P:1805.43 E:0.023411 |  Now it's with Banes into Sturling again just a little
[4414.18 - 4417.34] P:1746.47 E:0.025291 |  left of the penalty area but his tackle loses it and it's
[4417.34 - 4421.82] P:1734.11 E:0.024205 |  taken clear by Italy by Kandreva up towards the halfway line
[4421.82 - 4422.70] P:1680.92 E:0.024471 |  towards Balacely.
[4423.18 - 4427.26] P:1716.57 E:0.024238 |  He's tackled by Jaguilka and Jaguilka the Everton defender
[4427.26 - 4429.50] P:1666.99 E:0.025453 |  plays it all the way back to Joe Hart.
[4430.58 - 4431.22] P:1750.42 E:0.029577 |  She was right.
[4431.22 - 4436.82] P:1646.69 E:0.022391 |  Hart had no chance with the shot from Marquisio but it went past
[4436.82 - 4440.18] P:1565.94 E:0.025859 |  four England defenders then when they were fine at all.
[4440.50 - 4443.58] P:1749.29 E:0.024957 |  Yeah I think Wayne Rooney was actually the last man thought
[4443.58 - 4444.58] P:1739.04 E:0.024390 |  about putting his foot out.
[4446.10 - 4448.14] P:1815.99 E:0.027528 |  It's very very difficult in that situation.
[4448.14 - 4450.26] P:1731.32 E:0.027166 |  You know you throw your foot out you can't reach it properly.
[4450.62 - 4453.50] P:1812.44 E:0.027176 |  You have the issue of deflecting it into the goal.
[4454.30 - 4455.58] P:1882.62 E:0.024917 |  It was just a great strike.
[4455.58 - 4457.94] P:1674.05 E:0.024957 |  Well worked set-piece England didn't deal with it.
[4457.94 - 4460.82] P:1764.46 E:0.022524 |  They left Marquisio unmarked on the edge of the box and he
[4460.82 - 4463.58] P:1726.87 E:0.023742 |  fired it directly into the corner but a great response after
[4463.58 - 4463.86] P:1682.93 E:0.020361 |  that.
[4464.06 - 4467.46] P:1710.56 E:0.022408 |  Balacely was well offside England free kick as the result and
[4467.46 - 4470.62] P:1605.98 E:0.024885 |  it's played to Johnson onto the far side and England goal
[4470.62 - 4471.98] P:1695.89 E:0.025817 |  score Daniel Sturridge.
[4472.46 - 4476.90] P:1601.38 E:0.024461 |  Out off for defender Paletta and a throw to England just beyond
[4476.90 - 4477.66] P:1430.43 E:0.026111 |  the halfway line.
[4478.62 - 4479.62] P:1588.15 E:0.028897 |  Far side of the field.
[4479.62 - 4480.62] P:1506.55 E:0.024179 |  That's the England right.
[4481.42 - 4484.14] P:1528.26 E:0.025319 |  Johnson takes it to Wayne Rooney.
[4484.50 - 4485.34] P:1664.93 E:0.024571 |  Back to Johnson.
[4485.58 - 4489.34] P:1597.11 E:0.024666 |  Still inside the Italian half but it's played back into the
[4489.34 - 4490.90] P:1566.62 E:0.028054 |  England half night to Gary Cahill.
[4491.58 - 4494.30] P:1693.49 E:0.024955 |  Cahill supes it to Jagie Elka.
[4494.46 - 4496.82] P:1723.79 E:0.026853 |  Jagie Elka still 15 yards short of the halfway line.
[4497.06 - 4498.78] P:1822.49 E:0.024883 |  Cruised it to his club colleague Baines.
[4499.10 - 4500.14] P:1667.94 E:0.025762 |  Back to Jagie Elka.
[4500.70 - 4502.06] P:1768.54 E:0.027877 |  Jagie Elka looks inside.
[4502.06 - 4503.22] P:1612.03 E:0.026783 |  See's Cahill available.
[4503.42 - 4504.66] P:1623.82 E:0.027241 |  Henderson's available too.
[4505.02 - 4506.66] P:1546.68 E:0.026453 |  And the ball goes to the Liverpool player.
[4507.14 - 4508.46] P:1478.28 E:0.026890 |  And onto another Liverpool player.
[4508.46 - 4510.90] P:1635.60 E:0.023888 |  Five of them in Roy Hodgson's team.
[4511.46 - 4512.82] P:1843.53 E:0.024971 |  And here's Sturridge.
[4513.26 - 4514.54] P:1624.61 E:0.029929 |  Another Liverpool player.
[4514.66 - 4517.14] P:1792.48 E:0.028947 |  Sturridge just left but it pushed away by the goalkeeper.
[4518.02 - 4519.26] P:1722.40 E:0.027796 |  Seem to get down quite late.
[4519.90 - 4520.46] P:1585.80 E:0.026654 |  Siddiqui.
[4520.86 - 4521.82] P:1465.65 E:0.030205 |  England still have the ball.
[4522.10 - 4523.78] P:1648.76 E:0.028847 |  Rooney down the right side is one of the corner.
[4525.82 - 4526.82] P:1745.48 E:0.029170 |  Another good move from England.
[4526.82 - 4528.98] P:1852.86 E:0.027029 |  Daniel Sturridge, a little bit of individual brilliance.
[4529.26 - 4531.98] P:1586.11 E:0.024892 |  Took three Italian defenders out of the game.
[4532.26 - 4535.02] P:1548.58 E:0.026336 |  Not quite sure he caught it as well as he wanted to.
[4535.02 - 4537.58] P:1713.00 E:0.024866 |  But Searragu almost went down in instalments.
[4537.98 - 4539.30] P:1743.84 E:0.025369 |  It took him so long to get down.
[4539.70 - 4542.02] P:1661.52 E:0.025076 |  But again, positivity from England, which is great to see.
[4542.86 - 4544.86] P:1653.95 E:0.025937 |  Now, from the England right side,
[4544.86 - 4547.46] P:1602.29 E:0.025928 |  Leighton Baines will deliver this corner left footed.
[4548.26 - 4551.06] P:1669.07 E:0.027949 |  Three England players grouped around the Italian goalkeeper.
[4551.58 - 4553.38] P:1746.39 E:0.026118 |  Baines wants to put it in his direction.
[4553.58 - 4554.34] P:1742.58 E:0.028526 |  There it goes.
[4554.46 - 4557.18] P:1724.49 E:0.026319 |  Searragu came, didn't make any attempt to catch the ball.
[4557.42 - 4559.22] P:1547.57 E:0.023148 |  And it's a glancing header wide.
[4559.22 - 4560.58] P:1586.47 E:0.020597 |  It must evolve at England player.
[4560.86 - 4562.78] P:1602.80 E:0.023068 |  And it's behind for a goal kick to Italy.
[4563.18 - 4564.42] P:1553.16 E:0.026804 |  Four minutes gone on the second half.
[4564.58 - 4565.74] P:1471.87 E:0.028262 |  England won, Italy won.
[4565.74 - 4568.62] P:1654.51 E:0.025651 |  You're listening to your World Cup station.
[4568.74 - 4571.10] P:1628.18 E:0.026919 |  Brazil, 2014, five line.
[4572.22 - 4574.42] P:1860.31 E:0.028183 |  England could do a little bit better with their set pieces.
[4574.82 - 4575.50] P:1677.26 E:0.025396 |  They haven't been great.
[4575.50 - 4578.82] P:1777.76 E:0.025935 |  There was just that one Steve and Gerard corner that was whipped in
[4578.82 - 4579.98] P:1764.47 E:0.022615 |  and made it way through,
[4579.98 - 4582.34] P:1796.89 E:0.025279 |  made its way through to Wayne Rooney at the far post.
[4582.34 - 4584.10] P:1718.47 E:0.023086 |  But apart from that, I think set piece from England
[4584.10 - 4585.62] P:1639.81 E:0.021281 |  have been a little bit wasted at times.
[4586.86 - 4588.46] P:1784.78 E:0.026323 |  The goal kick is taken short by Italy.
[4589.06 - 4592.14] P:1646.34 E:0.024453 |  Pirlo, now to Virati, back to Pirlo.
[4593.14 - 4595.26] P:1694.55 E:0.026591 |  It just sort of strolls around the game.
[4595.66 - 4596.86] P:1851.86 E:0.022612 |  Looks half-paced, Pirlo,
[4596.86 - 4599.26] P:1668.77 E:0.025332 |  but it's his brain that does all the quick thinking.
[4599.54 - 4603.18] P:1725.94 E:0.024938 |  Nice with Damian, the right pullback, up inside the England half.
[4603.18 - 4604.66] P:1720.12 E:0.026848 |  On it goes now to Candreva.
[4604.66 - 4606.10] P:1727.19 E:0.028649 |  Candreva onto his left foot.
[4606.10 - 4606.94] P:1865.43 E:0.028476 |  Clare Crosser, deep.
[4606.94 - 4608.06] P:1956.21 E:0.027375 |  Ballotelli hits it in.
[4609.66 - 4611.50] P:1901.14 E:0.028694 |  Simple enough goal for Italy.
[4611.82 - 4615.30] P:1873.52 E:0.028886 |  Ballotelli, relatively free on the edge of the six yard box.
[4615.54 - 4617.58] P:1831.97 E:0.028747 |  Dornburn header, dual heart, no chance.
[4617.58 - 4619.58] P:1911.23 E:0.026642 |  And Italy are back in front.
[4619.58 - 4621.18] P:1952.30 E:0.027989 |  England won, Italy too.
[4621.78 - 4624.86] P:1904.20 E:0.029280 |  The moment Candreva cut inside, back onto his left foot.
[4625.26 - 4626.70] P:1892.87 E:0.029007 |  You could see that goal coming.
[4626.70 - 4629.50] P:1922.36 E:0.028617 |  Ballotelli had peeled off at the far post.
[4630.30 - 4633.06] P:1905.30 E:0.028205 |  Again, England's masters of their own downfall.
[4633.42 - 4634.54] P:1910.26 E:0.028409 |  Not defended properly.
[4634.54 - 4636.58] P:1888.29 E:0.028201 |  Layton Baines exposed, two on one.
[4637.38 - 4640.54] P:1829.81 E:0.026939 |  Then he dives in, goes for the cross, doesn't get there.
[4640.98 - 4644.50] P:1813.92 E:0.026866 |  And at Ballotelli, he pulls off Jagyelka at the far post.
[4644.50 - 4645.74] P:1861.35 E:0.024136 |  No, sorry, it's Cahill.
[4645.74 - 4648.62] P:1749.99 E:0.027377 |  But he pulls away from the far post and a good down would have a.
[4648.86 - 4650.86] P:1768.53 E:0.024963 |  But it's this left-hand side.
[4650.86 - 4653.06] P:1678.64 E:0.026840 |  Layton Baines out, numbered in the first place.
[4653.58 - 4655.30] P:1736.36 E:0.025475 |  That's, there's nothing he can do about that.
[4655.30 - 4656.78] P:1738.11 E:0.025968 |  It's very, very difficult.
[4656.78 - 4659.14] P:1712.50 E:0.025688 |  But then he dives into the cross.
[4659.14 - 4662.18] P:1804.76 E:0.025201 |  Candreva cuts back on his left.
[4662.70 - 4664.86] P:1753.24 E:0.026760 |  Dinks the ball to the far post.
[4664.86 - 4666.50] P:1790.79 E:0.026435 |  Gary Cahill gets caught underneath it.
[4666.50 - 4668.94] P:1660.66 E:0.024073 |  Ballotelli, a couple of steps off him.
[4668.94 - 4670.54] P:1655.43 E:0.026344 |  And a very, very good header.
[4670.54 - 4673.14] P:1637.21 E:0.025916 |  Again, Johar, no chance with that one.
[4673.14 - 4674.98] P:1641.21 E:0.024520 |  And England again have it all to do.
[4674.98 - 4677.18] P:1703.11 E:0.026559 |  But it's just this left-hand side that constantly calls.
[4677.18 - 4678.26] P:1761.87 E:0.028249 |  Good work by Sturridge.
[4678.26 - 4680.42] P:1849.20 E:0.027636 |  Sturridge up to the edge of the penalty game to the penalty.
[4680.42 - 4683.18] P:1875.43 E:0.029031 |  Still running, Kanglis Sturridge, but he can't get a third defender.
[4683.18 - 4687.22] P:1819.53 E:0.025374 |  And it's Clatterclerc by Falata, of towards the half-Waila.
[4687.22 - 4690.54] P:1631.67 E:0.029671 |  So England have to come from behind again to get something from this game.
[4690.54 - 4694.54] P:1761.81 E:0.027810 |  Remember earlier, Costa Rica beat Uruguay by three goals to one.
[4694.54 - 4696.98] P:1803.46 E:0.027617 |  Well, Gerard seemed to run into the referee there.
[4696.98 - 4699.22] P:1855.12 E:0.027359 |  But the ball squirts away to England's possession.
[4699.22 - 4701.66] P:1713.52 E:0.028181 |  It's with Sturridge into Welbeck, into the penalty here.
[4701.66 - 4703.86] P:1804.28 E:0.028892 |  Oh, Nalabbeck died by Welbeck.
[4703.86 - 4705.34] P:1851.59 E:0.026966 |  Sorry, that is not a penalty kick.
[4705.34 - 4706.54] P:1855.05 E:0.027002 |  It's an embarrassment.
[4707.22 - 4712.02] P:1827.11 E:0.026289 |  Referee from Holland of Jhon Keifers rightly ignores it.
[4712.02 - 4714.42] P:1824.33 E:0.025697 |  Might be a touch for Jhon, not to pick up a yellow card for that.
[4714.42 - 4717.38] P:1846.67 E:0.027433 |  He's thrown himself again rather than he had to play.
[4719.66 - 4721.46] P:1959.42 E:0.027546 |  To Rossi Perittoli.
[4721.46 - 4723.62] P:1859.86 E:0.026537 |  To the near side and Candreba.
[4723.62 - 4725.62] P:1867.40 E:0.026426 |  Wasn't that a great cross to Candreba?
[4725.62 - 4727.58] P:1831.11 E:0.027440 |  It was a brilliant cross, but it should never have got there.
[4727.58 - 4729.22] P:1969.73 E:0.025638 |  England have tried to address the situation
[4729.22 - 4731.26] P:1728.36 E:0.023263 |  by putting Welbeck on the left-hand side.
[4731.26 - 4732.46] P:1752.41 E:0.026418 |  It's clearly a problem.
[4732.46 - 4734.54] P:1745.91 E:0.025759 |  All first half, it was a problem.
[4734.54 - 4736.06] P:1729.99 E:0.024791 |  And then Leighton Baines.
[4736.06 - 4739.50] P:1746.77 E:0.025304 |  You know, Candreba shaped with his right foot to put the cross in.
[4739.50 - 4741.86] P:1723.52 E:0.024538 |  Leighton Baines dived in, jumped in the air.
[4741.86 - 4744.14] P:1693.51 E:0.023572 |  That allowed Candreba to cut back inside him
[4744.14 - 4746.34] P:1694.44 E:0.025823 |  and just think the ball to the far post.
[4747.34 - 4749.26] P:1785.44 E:0.025940 |  A poor goal from England's point of view.
[4749.26 - 4750.74] P:1573.35 E:0.025468 |  Barati on the halfway line.
[4750.74 - 4754.70] P:1709.91 E:0.024815 |  To Damien, the right back, who loves to attack forward to the score
[4754.70 - 4756.86] P:1738.85 E:0.027940 |  of the latest goal, a peretli, Perittoli,
[4756.86 - 4759.46] P:1746.29 E:0.025374 |  but he moves just a fraction offside.
[4759.46 - 4761.38] P:1696.97 E:0.024966 |  The assistant's flight was up very quickly
[4761.38 - 4763.46] P:1764.82 E:0.023771 |  and it's a pre-kick to England.
[4764.66 - 4767.66] P:1582.80 E:0.026404 |  Well, obviously, we're hoping for an England reply.
[4767.66 - 4770.38] P:1585.57 E:0.027189 |  But if England lose this game, Uruguay have lost.
[4770.38 - 4773.62] P:1572.49 E:0.025327 |  It's an off-blooded stake in Sao Paulo in the two-meat.
[4773.62 - 4775.06] P:1798.50 E:0.027040 |  Well, it's going to be a huge game.
[4775.06 - 4777.98] P:1718.01 E:0.026102 |  I think the fact that Uruguay have lost
[4777.98 - 4779.18] P:1755.80 E:0.025459 |  makes it a harder game anyhow.
[4779.18 - 4780.58] P:1651.72 E:0.025203 |  They all have to come out and play.
[4780.58 - 4783.86] P:1629.47 E:0.027563 |  They are very, very likely to throw Luis Suarez into the mix.
[4783.86 - 4786.50] P:1608.74 E:0.026518 |  Bit or not, I think they all have to gamble in.
[4786.50 - 4789.34] P:1652.34 E:0.027328 |  Of course, if the result stays the same, England also.
[4790.46 - 4793.54] P:1678.02 E:0.027505 |  Henderson, shoots the ball towards the near side to Jaguilca,
[4793.58 - 4795.82] P:1631.66 E:0.026825 |  who lose inside the Italian half.
[4795.82 - 4798.02] P:1594.80 E:0.026505 |  England all in white, Italy all in blue.
[4798.02 - 4799.02] P:1690.26 E:0.025515 |  Now, Gerard.
[4799.02 - 4800.54] P:1688.79 E:0.026969 |  Gerard, good ball forward.
[4800.54 - 4802.98] P:1689.75 E:0.027235 |  Sturryfield didn't control it.
[4802.98 - 4806.50] P:1704.92 E:0.026439 |  And Italy a possession again, and Pirlo does a squander possession.
[4806.50 - 4808.06] P:1617.23 E:0.027568 |  Plays it back to Barzagli.
[4808.06 - 4812.42] P:1660.75 E:0.027042 |  And on from Di Rossi, Italy clearly have grown in stature
[4812.42 - 4814.18] P:1655.48 E:0.025448 |  since their second goal.
[4814.18 - 4816.90] P:1576.33 E:0.027709 |  Pirlo, into Verratti, just over the half way.
[4816.90 - 4818.78] P:1656.03 E:0.026346 |  Tackle and beaten by Gerard.
[4818.78 - 4820.70] P:1735.60 E:0.028910 |  Ball squirts through now to Rooney.
[4820.70 - 4823.02] P:1766.45 E:0.030269 |  Rooney running forward towards the penalty area.
[4823.02 - 4826.38] P:1771.69 E:0.028808 |  Forster run wide, shoots across the face of the Orgel, and it's a drive.
[4826.38 - 4829.34] P:1788.99 E:0.027541 |  Wide of the far post, and it's behind for the golfer.
[4829.34 - 4831.10] P:1806.48 E:0.027773 |  Bets from Wayne Rooney.
[4831.10 - 4835.22] P:1743.18 E:0.024922 |  Shot from distance, didn't quite catch it cleanly.
[4835.22 - 4837.10] P:1716.31 E:0.025413 |  Came across it a bit too much in the end,
[4837.10 - 4839.46] P:1747.28 E:0.025549 |  bubbled three or four yards wide.
[4839.46 - 4843.34] P:1674.13 E:0.022258 |  But England have got to do something about this left-hand side.
[4843.34 - 4846.86] P:1755.88 E:0.024189 |  Struggled all first half, conceded a goal from it,
[4846.86 - 4849.14] P:1670.67 E:0.024933 |  and still it's causing problems.
[4849.18 - 4853.42] P:1776.21 E:0.023563 |  Italy keep probing the England left flank.
[4853.42 - 4858.10] P:1688.91 E:0.024856 |  Wellbeck should be better than Rooney, helping protect Leighton Baines.
[4858.10 - 4859.98] P:1690.29 E:0.026019 |  But so far, that's not the case,
[4859.98 - 4861.74] P:1528.49 E:0.025499 |  in the opening nine minutes with the second half.
[4861.74 - 4864.90] P:1692.82 E:0.024200 |  You're listening to Five Live on the BBC.
[4864.90 - 4867.18] P:1740.53 E:0.027335 |  England trail-itly to what?
[4867.18 - 4869.98] P:1704.46 E:0.025743 |  Here's Stern from Gerard's pass onto Sterry.
[4869.98 - 4871.62] P:1666.70 E:0.027610 |  Johnson's available on the far side.
[4871.62 - 4873.78] P:1818.06 E:0.028537 |  Sterry picks him out, jumps him with room.
[4873.78 - 4876.58] P:1858.38 E:0.028523 |  Crosses first time in towards the six-yard box,
[4876.58 - 4878.82] P:1812.03 E:0.028142 |  but it finds a blue shirt and it's clean.
[4878.82 - 4881.70] P:1826.15 E:0.026637 |  Only as far as Gerard, who chests it down to Baines.
[4881.70 - 4883.70] P:1728.48 E:0.026480 |  Gerard wants more.
[4883.70 - 4887.34] P:1695.74 E:0.027004 |  And Gerard hits a cross-field ball to Glenn Johnson on the far side.
[4887.34 - 4890.46] P:1695.51 E:0.027046 |  Accurately play, good control by Glenn Johnson.
[4890.46 - 4892.82] P:1687.08 E:0.028683 |  Up towards the edge of the penalty chair, into Sterling.
[4892.82 - 4894.66] P:1724.82 E:0.028756 |  Sterling's shot was weak anyway.
[4894.66 - 4897.86] P:1692.01 E:0.027805 |  A hit-hand defender who plays it back to Sudoku,
[4897.86 - 4900.90] P:1668.23 E:0.029274 |  and the goalkeeper hits it under play on the far side of the field
[4900.90 - 4902.62] P:1740.01 E:0.030644 |  for a throw into England.
[4902.62 - 4905.14] P:1789.35 E:0.028393 |  England have got to try and get their full backs further forward.
[4905.14 - 4908.02] P:1656.60 E:0.025944 |  They've got to get some width and cause the Italians some problems.
[4908.06 - 4910.14] P:1590.94 E:0.026184 |  The Italian defence very, very well drilled.
[4910.14 - 4911.74] P:1521.36 E:0.025247 |  When players are running through the middle,
[4911.74 - 4914.22] P:1632.47 E:0.026979 |  a little bit of brilliance from Rooney or Sturridge is fine.
[4914.22 - 4918.18] P:1546.73 E:0.024727 |  Swarmed round by three, four, five Italian defenders at time.
[4918.18 - 4920.78] P:1553.71 E:0.025407 |  England have got to spread the game, get the ball wider,
[4920.78 - 4923.46] P:1696.43 E:0.023691 |  and they'll only do that by getting their full backs further up the pitch.
[4923.46 - 4925.10] P:1748.59 E:0.026742 |  Throwing goes towards Sterling,
[4925.10 - 4929.06] P:1781.19 E:0.027306 |  and he puts pressure on Chiellini, who heads it behind for an England corner.
[4929.06 - 4935.06] P:1700.37 E:0.025031 |  England equalised within two minutes of Italy taking the lead in the first half.
[4935.10 - 4939.58] P:1708.90 E:0.026081 |  It's five minutes since Balotelli made it 2-1 for Italy.
[4939.58 - 4941.50] P:1665.87 E:0.026389 |  This time, Baines doesn't take the corner.
[4941.50 - 4943.78] P:1631.09 E:0.023871 |  It's Stephen Gerard from the right,
[4943.78 - 4946.78] P:1660.91 E:0.025165 |  and Gary Cahill's on the far post.
[4946.78 - 4949.26] P:1632.58 E:0.027257 |  Gerard waits, and now he delivers.
[4949.26 - 4951.54] P:1644.25 E:0.028430 |  Swing it in, deep looking for Wayne Rooney.
[4951.54 - 4953.06] P:1734.15 E:0.027464 |  Skims off the head of De Rossi,
[4953.06 - 4955.22] P:1616.41 E:0.027404 |  England furrows down in the penalty area,
[4955.22 - 4957.42] P:1704.90 E:0.026499 |  it's Gary Cahill, ball still in play.
[4957.42 - 4960.10] P:1707.08 E:0.025861 |  Cahill's back in his feet, and here's Rooney.
[4960.10 - 4963.06] P:1679.41 E:0.026150 |  And Rooney crossed that ball, accurately as it turned out.
[4963.06 - 4967.06] P:1833.26 E:0.029185 |  Gerard threw, Gerard tackled well, and is behind for a goal.
[4968.34 - 4973.90] P:1798.86 E:0.027588 |  Stephen Gerard went down in hope, I think, rather than expectation.
[4973.90 - 4978.14] P:1727.26 E:0.025732 |  As the challenge came in from Palletta, it just stood his ground,
[4978.14 - 4981.70] P:1787.76 E:0.027361 |  got his body in the way, didn't really make a challenge,
[4981.70 - 4985.22] P:1598.49 E:0.026456 |  not enough in it for a penalty, nobody really appeals for it.
[4985.22 - 4988.02] P:1600.67 E:0.025327 |  But that's what England have got to do, they've got to get into that box,
[4988.02 - 4991.70] P:1687.22 E:0.025682 |  play those little balls down the sides, and go from there.
[4991.70 - 4994.02] P:1650.97 E:0.027686 |  Jordan Henderson complaining to the Dutch referee,
[4994.02 - 4999.34] P:1721.63 E:0.027878 |  but it won't change his mind, and we're going to have a change for Italy.
[4999.34 - 5004.10] P:1823.70 E:0.028230 |  Motta will come on, and here's that Verratti.
[5004.10 - 5007.22] P:1862.81 E:0.029931 |  Now, Verratti was injured leading up to the tournament,
[5007.22 - 5009.66] P:1789.53 E:0.027988 |  I wonder if that's a recurrence of his injury.
[5009.66 - 5013.22] P:1761.70 E:0.025734 |  Motta is on to Verratti, left scope, inside to Ian Dennis.
[5013.22 - 5016.02] P:1600.31 E:0.030777 |  It should be said quickly that the referee had an excellent view
[5016.02 - 5018.10] P:1763.43 E:0.029966 |  of that coming together with Stephen Gerard,
[5018.10 - 5019.94] P:1769.10 E:0.030235 |  but also just watch for Raheem Sterling,
[5019.98 - 5021.58] P:1658.59 E:0.029524 |  because when that corner was taken,
[5021.58 - 5026.50] P:1602.52 E:0.028387 |  he was feeling at the back of the hamstrings on both his right and left leg.
[5026.50 - 5028.50] P:1636.81 E:0.022882 |  That's a worry.
[5028.50 - 5030.38] P:1678.57 E:0.028159 |  Not least, the score lineings are worrying.
[5030.38 - 5034.98] P:1829.59 E:0.024848 |  England won in the 2nd, 12 minutes gone to the second half of 5-5.
[5034.98 - 5038.26] P:1754.56 E:0.025510 |  Now, Motta just drops alongside Pirlo in the midfield,
[5038.26 - 5040.38] P:1652.70 E:0.025161 |  where Verratti hit me in play.
[5040.38 - 5043.30] P:1684.30 E:0.025380 |  Motta back now to De Rossi,
[5043.30 - 5045.86] P:1611.09 E:0.025958 |  and De Rossi chips it arrogantly towards the far side,
[5045.86 - 5048.46] P:1727.28 E:0.023543 |  I say arrogantly, what I mean, he chipped it really well,
[5048.50 - 5050.26] P:1703.83 E:0.024631 |  knew exactly what he was doing.
[5050.26 - 5051.78] P:1680.15 E:0.028809 |  Fine, Keenini, back to Pirlo.
[5051.78 - 5054.06] P:1700.82 E:0.025969 |  Pirlo followed De Balotelli once again.
[5054.06 - 5056.86] P:1696.53 E:0.023872 |  Balotelli is offside, and it's a pre-kick to England.
[5058.34 - 5061.06] P:1676.33 E:0.022852 |  England's got to settle themselves down now.
[5061.06 - 5064.74] P:1651.84 E:0.023463 |  See what the next five or six minutes brings.
[5064.74 - 5069.62] P:1649.81 E:0.023867 |  If they can stop Italy down this, or their left-hand side,
[5069.62 - 5071.02] P:1646.84 E:0.022898 |  Italy's right-hand side,
[5071.02 - 5073.62] P:1592.72 E:0.026223 |  and then really they've got to try and attack a little bit more
[5073.62 - 5075.26] P:1711.20 E:0.026121 |  with a little bit more purpose,
[5075.26 - 5077.38] P:1730.25 E:0.023148 |  because England had some half chances,
[5077.42 - 5079.42] P:1738.84 E:0.028890 |  but Sirigou pretty much untroubled,
[5079.42 - 5081.42] P:1735.35 E:0.026515 |  and this has been long-distance shots.
[5081.42 - 5085.02] P:1731.33 E:0.025890 |  Rooney Fawes, Keenini in the far side of the field,
[5085.02 - 5086.98] P:1613.86 E:0.023065 |  no significant harm done.
[5086.98 - 5089.82] P:1668.22 E:0.025524 |  I was just thinking, Danny, if there was going to be an England change,
[5089.82 - 5092.86] P:1563.77 E:0.024038 |  and it appears that Ross Barkley will be coming on.
[5092.86 - 5095.34] P:1591.93 E:0.024987 |  No, interesting who he takes off.
[5095.34 - 5099.46] P:1686.18 E:0.024089 |  I mean, if Sterling's got a problem, it'll be Sterling.
[5099.46 - 5100.98] P:1803.61 E:0.026710 |  Anyway, Italy on the attack,
[5100.98 - 5103.90] P:1716.94 E:0.024625 |  Darmien down the right side, the pass wasn't accurate,
[5103.90 - 5106.86] P:1709.74 E:0.023475 |  Baines gets there, and Baines clears for England.
[5106.86 - 5108.42] P:1782.47 E:0.026763 |  High towards Welbeck.
[5108.42 - 5110.82] P:1719.85 E:0.025516 |  Welbeck takes it on the chase, but loses possession,
[5110.82 - 5112.86] P:1642.17 E:0.026690 |  not before he was fouled.
[5112.86 - 5115.46] P:1698.38 E:0.025262 |  Free kick to England.
[5115.46 - 5120.98] P:1710.85 E:0.024228 |  Cesare Frandelli, he's been obviously in the technical area
[5120.98 - 5124.70] P:1671.85 E:0.024114 |  quite a lot tonight, and I just haven't seen Roy Hudson.
[5124.70 - 5126.46] P:1630.39 E:0.024047 |  Maybe he's been out there and I haven't noticed him.
[5126.46 - 5128.30] P:1767.48 E:0.027177 |  From the free kick, Sterling down the left side,
[5128.30 - 5131.42] P:1803.17 E:0.025058 |  and a short down, still gets the cross in.
[5131.42 - 5135.46] P:1688.81 E:0.022936 |  Sterling can't control it, and it's behind for a goal kick.
[5135.46 - 5139.38] P:1706.89 E:0.021355 |  Barkley's coming on, but who for?
[5139.38 - 5141.46] P:1680.66 E:0.024853 |  Not quite sure.
[5141.46 - 5143.18] P:1765.59 E:0.026557 |  Bruni possibly, but if he said it,
[5143.18 - 5145.18] P:1726.43 E:0.025006 |  if Sterling has got a little bit of an injury,
[5145.18 - 5146.74] P:1776.62 E:0.022616 |  maybe taking him off.
[5146.74 - 5149.74] P:1697.70 E:0.025053 |  I think Roy Hudson's been very, very positive so far.
[5149.74 - 5151.38] P:1731.57 E:0.024209 |  I think you can't blame Roy Hudson
[5151.38 - 5152.98] P:1737.98 E:0.022758 |  for really anything that's gone wrong.
[5152.98 - 5154.38] P:1762.28 E:0.025369 |  He's caught out down this left-hand side,
[5154.38 - 5157.62] P:1786.45 E:0.023595 |  he tried to address it with Danny Welbeck,
[5157.62 - 5159.38] P:1782.78 E:0.024360 |  and that's down to players.
[5159.38 - 5160.74] P:1795.23 E:0.025314 |  Players have to be responsible.
[5160.74 - 5162.34] P:1714.72 E:0.024819 |  Once they've been given instructions,
[5162.34 - 5164.82] P:1717.53 E:0.024584 |  they have to do as they're told, and they haven't done that,
[5164.82 - 5166.78] P:1749.28 E:0.023925 |  and that's why they find themselves two-one-done.
[5166.78 - 5168.42] P:1635.04 E:0.027606 |  I mean, look at both Italian fullbacks.
[5168.42 - 5170.38] P:1613.36 E:0.024076 |  They're pushing forward, aren't they?
[5170.38 - 5174.10] P:1573.09 E:0.025012 |  They're really pressing on the England defence,
[5174.10 - 5176.86] P:1705.90 E:0.025581 |  like Guilini is doing now from Pirlo's pass,
[5176.86 - 5178.66] P:1670.46 E:0.025812 |  and it's back to Pirlo on the halfway line,
[5178.66 - 5183.06] P:1646.97 E:0.025897 |  left of the centre-circle, onto Mottam, the substitute.
[5183.06 - 5184.38] P:1664.51 E:0.026519 |  Pirlo again.
[5184.38 - 5186.70] P:1714.89 E:0.026251 |  It's the Italian fans that you're hearing
[5186.70 - 5190.66] P:1737.16 E:0.024990 |  seeing the moment inside the Arena, Amazonia.
[5190.66 - 5192.30] P:1699.20 E:0.026148 |  Not 40,000 in there tonight.
[5192.30 - 5197.18] P:1808.26 E:0.024963 |  Lots of empty seats, but still a wonderful spectacle.
[5197.18 - 5200.14] P:1788.65 E:0.023585 |  Darmine down the right side.
[5200.14 - 5203.02] P:1780.76 E:0.025378 |  More or less given up defending to Mottam.
[5203.02 - 5206.14] P:1763.96 E:0.025203 |  Mottam now from Pirlo's pass.
[5206.14 - 5208.34] P:1776.12 E:0.027937 |  I know the cross-entrance in the airport.
[5208.34 - 5210.50] P:1762.29 E:0.026860 |  Goodness gracious, Ballotelli almost got there,
[5210.50 - 5212.78] P:1792.04 E:0.026084 |  but it's safely through the Juha.
[5212.78 - 5215.98] P:1811.92 E:0.024223 |  Any sort of touch from Ballotelli, that was in the back of the net.
[5215.98 - 5218.62] P:1764.49 E:0.024477 |  Italy, again, down this right-hand,
[5218.62 - 5221.10] P:1830.91 E:0.025577 |  or their right-hand side, now the left-hand side.
[5221.10 - 5223.90] P:1923.14 E:0.025617 |  Just interesting, Stirling's now come out to this left-hand side.
[5223.90 - 5226.30] P:1906.61 E:0.026766 |  I wonder if they're going to use that and leave him on
[5226.30 - 5229.70] P:1910.36 E:0.023104 |  and keep the pace on this left to try and push Marati back.
[5229.70 - 5232.70] P:1760.47 E:0.025000 |  Henderson to Rune, who's mainly done the right side
[5232.70 - 5234.06] P:1779.16 E:0.023767 |  during this second half.
[5234.06 - 5237.70] P:1756.81 E:0.027232 |  Into Henderson again. Rune wants more, good ball into Sturridge.
[5237.70 - 5239.82] P:1786.35 E:0.026853 |  30 yards of goal. Sturridge moves forward
[5239.82 - 5241.34] P:1813.62 E:0.026805 |  towards the D of the Italian penalty.
[5241.34 - 5244.26] P:1861.70 E:0.023679 |  Should knock that far wide.
[5244.26 - 5246.78] P:1887.79 E:0.026021 |  Just scooped it slightly, had the right idea.
[5246.78 - 5249.46] P:1842.91 E:0.019833 |  Went to go back across himself.
[5249.46 - 5252.34] P:1754.36 E:0.019736 |  It's Welbeck who's coming off.
[5252.34 - 5255.78] P:1774.55 E:0.026201 |  Well, that'll be interesting to see now who comes out to this left-hand side.
[5255.78 - 5257.46] P:1820.47 E:0.022813 |  I think it might be Stirling.
[5257.46 - 5259.62] P:1837.23 E:0.025006 |  Stirling comes to this left-hand side.
[5259.62 - 5262.70] P:1793.32 E:0.025263 |  He will try and push the full-back Damian back,
[5262.70 - 5264.78] P:1831.96 E:0.023720 |  because that's where the problems are coming from.
[5264.78 - 5266.66] P:1818.68 E:0.025652 |  Can Drave have been very, very clever,
[5266.66 - 5271.46] P:1851.90 E:0.024483 |  playing in a little pocket in between, just in front of Leighton-Baines.
[5271.46 - 5274.46] P:1751.08 E:0.027706 |  He doesn't want to come and mark him.
[5274.46 - 5276.58] P:1722.65 E:0.027647 |  And then, of course, you've got the overlapping full-back.
[5276.58 - 5278.18] P:1766.64 E:0.027484 |  Barkley is good. He's got to...
[5278.18 - 5279.82] P:1703.17 E:0.024335 |  He's in the centre.
[5279.82 - 5281.62] P:1784.51 E:0.022802 |  Stirling out on the left-hand side.
[5281.62 - 5284.18] P:1608.01 E:0.025988 |  Again, you have to say, positive changes from Roy Hudson.
[5284.18 - 5287.18] P:1571.90 E:0.023259 |  He's doing everything he possibly can.
[5287.18 - 5288.90] P:1606.39 E:0.029328 |  England trail 2-1.
[5288.90 - 5291.18] P:1619.29 E:0.027446 |  Ian Genesis, big side.
[5291.18 - 5292.70] P:1658.92 E:0.029884 |  Yes, Alan, just quickly.
[5292.70 - 5294.70] P:1675.10 E:0.029278 |  I thought Gary Neville was trying to get Wayne Rooney
[5294.70 - 5296.18] P:1453.35 E:0.028926 |  to come over towards that side.
[5296.18 - 5298.70] P:1556.62 E:0.026876 |  But as it is, it's now Stirling who's playing on the England left.
[5298.70 - 5302.70] P:1825.74 E:0.025246 |  But I thought the way that Gary Neville was trying to gesture to Wayne Rooney
[5302.70 - 5305.70] P:1752.12 E:0.021029 |  that they wanted him to go back out on that left-hand side.
[5305.70 - 5307.70] P:1678.01 E:0.022471 |  Not so at the moment.
[5307.70 - 5309.70] P:1736.94 E:0.027844 |  Over to Stirling, the England goal scorer.
[5309.70 - 5311.70] P:1725.74 E:0.024899 |  He's done the right for England.
[5311.70 - 5314.70] P:1665.94 E:0.027175 |  Stirling checks one way, then the other, beats the defender for the third time.
[5314.70 - 5316.70] P:1808.76 E:0.025157 |  Still hasn't got the cross in.
[5316.70 - 5318.70] P:1700.63 E:0.026372 |  Slifts the pass back to Henderson.
[5318.70 - 5321.70] P:1706.05 E:0.027034 |  30 yards from goal, cross into the penalty area towards Wayne Rooney.
[5321.70 - 5323.70] P:1769.89 E:0.028825 |  Headed clear by the Italian defence.
[5323.70 - 5325.70] P:1886.22 E:0.029100 |  Baines picks it up into Rooney, rugby unlock.
[5325.70 - 5328.70] P:1863.67 E:0.027518 |  Rooney shoots wide! Oh, dear watchers!
[5328.70 - 5331.70] P:1770.37 E:0.028157 |  Great opportunity for Wayne Rooney.
[5331.70 - 5335.70] P:1719.36 E:0.026372 |  Roy Hudson, just sitting on a monster, throws his hands to his head.
[5335.70 - 5337.70] P:1759.21 E:0.026068 |  He's definitely on side.
[5337.70 - 5339.70] P:1692.28 E:0.024840 |  He's trying to push up, but got it wrong.
[5339.70 - 5341.70] P:1720.24 E:0.025491 |  He did the keeper with the eyes.
[5341.70 - 5344.70] P:1775.29 E:0.024786 |  Everyone thought he was going to try and bend it in the far post.
[5344.70 - 5348.70] P:1699.40 E:0.023654 |  Cut the ball back on himself towards the near and missed by about a foot.
[5348.70 - 5351.70] P:1702.53 E:0.023940 |  On target and that was in because the goalkeeper had gone the opposite way.
[5351.70 - 5355.70] P:1733.54 E:0.023649 |  Wayne Rooney yet to score in a World Cup finals.
[5355.70 - 5358.70] P:1634.23 E:0.027805 |  England won Italy 2 here in Manassu.
[5358.70 - 5361.70] P:1654.10 E:0.025503 |  We've already played 17 minutes of the second half.
[5361.70 - 5366.70] P:1700.05 E:0.025801 |  The temperature is fine considering the horrific forecast that we have.
[5366.70 - 5370.70] P:1824.75 E:0.026220 |  Henderson, such an obvious poll to storage.
[5370.70 - 5373.70] P:1660.47 E:0.024709 |  He was easily intercepted and here's Mota in the centre circle.
[5373.70 - 5375.70] P:1774.38 E:0.024052 |  De Pirlo back to De Rossi.
[5375.70 - 5379.70] P:1709.18 E:0.024782 |  De Pirlo again, it looks as if De Rossi had put him in trouble.
[5379.70 - 5383.70] P:1665.32 E:0.025904 |  Pirlo just found little urgency, kept the ball for Italy.
[5383.70 - 5387.70] P:1707.98 E:0.026433 |  Mota to Marcazio, score of the first Italian goal.
[5387.70 - 5390.70] P:1712.60 E:0.024422 |  On to the right side in Damien.
[5390.70 - 5392.70] P:1646.48 E:0.025380 |  Back once more to Candreva.
[5392.70 - 5395.70] P:1719.63 E:0.026578 |  Up towards the right of the penalty area.
[5395.70 - 5398.70] P:1722.70 E:0.025581 |  The England penalty area checks onto his left foot.
[5398.70 - 5400.70] P:1708.58 E:0.024566 |  Won't cross, but he dinks it back to De Rossi.
[5400.70 - 5402.70] P:1747.33 E:0.026891 |  That's a good pass. De Rossi, 30 yards out.
[5402.70 - 5404.70] P:1828.78 E:0.028818 |  Chips it into the penalty area.
[5404.70 - 5407.70] P:1824.33 E:0.028003 |  Blocked down under control, the shot by Damien, blocked by the defender.
[5407.70 - 5409.70] P:1765.67 E:0.029132 |  And Rooney can clear.
[5409.70 - 5411.70] P:1879.29 E:0.027317 |  An England can counterattack here.
[5411.70 - 5413.70] P:1853.37 E:0.028473 |  Henderson, surges forward into the centre circle.
[5413.70 - 5416.70] P:1887.98 E:0.025848 |  Slip the ball to Barclay, down the left.
[5416.70 - 5418.70] P:1797.32 E:0.026834 |  Sterling is inside the penalty area.
[5418.70 - 5420.70] P:1725.82 E:0.028430 |  Soto is Henderson. Barclay moves inside the box.
[5420.70 - 5423.70] P:1891.69 E:0.027857 |  Barclay shoots, simple save for the goalkeeper.
[5423.70 - 5425.70] P:1812.21 E:0.027482 |  He made a bit of a hash of it though.
[5425.70 - 5427.70] P:1806.07 E:0.027352 |  Only pushes it wide. Sterling is there.
[5427.70 - 5429.70] P:1802.92 E:0.026316 |  Sterling in the penalty area again.
[5429.70 - 5432.70] P:1741.21 E:0.026407 |  Right side, trying to create room for the cross for Sterridge.
[5432.70 - 5435.70] P:1837.52 E:0.028605 |  Hicks the defender and it's opening the goal.
[5435.70 - 5437.70] P:1921.92 E:0.027483 |  Well, at one end we have Italy with this tactic.
[5437.70 - 5440.70] P:1859.19 E:0.024179 |  They are definitely employing, which is to try and dink balls
[5440.70 - 5443.70] P:1777.94 E:0.025696 |  over top of the England defence for players running through.
[5443.70 - 5446.70] P:1749.47 E:0.024758 |  I think Sterling has gone down on the far side with Kramp.
[5446.70 - 5450.70] P:1807.09 E:0.023896 |  By the looks of it, it's Marchizio and Kealini actually helping him out.
[5450.70 - 5452.70] P:1744.40 E:0.024761 |  Very, very sporty for Italians.
[5452.70 - 5456.70] P:1908.91 E:0.025639 |  Not like them, but at the other end, Barclay, just as he cut in
[5456.70 - 5459.70] P:1870.29 E:0.023649 |  from the left-hand side, I think he just caught the ground a little bit.
[5459.70 - 5462.70] P:1766.62 E:0.022561 |  Saw a lot of sand flick up as he shot, not quite clean,
[5462.70 - 5466.70] P:1759.40 E:0.024043 |  but now I think it's going to be experienced Italian defence
[5466.70 - 5469.70] P:1710.92 E:0.024846 |  against a youthful enterprise in England attack.
[5469.70 - 5471.70] P:1660.20 E:0.024333 |  Sterling is receiving some treatment.
[5471.70 - 5473.70] P:1721.45 E:0.024504 |  Let's go pitch side, Nian Dennis.
[5473.70 - 5475.70] P:1689.34 E:0.028763 |  Yeah, it was Marchizio and Kealini who, first of all,
[5475.70 - 5477.70] P:1764.84 E:0.025449 |  applied the treatment. It looks like Kramp are trying to bend
[5477.70 - 5481.70] P:1731.24 E:0.028005 |  those toes back of those luminous orange boots of Raheem Sterling,
[5481.70 - 5483.70] P:1792.93 E:0.025357 |  who actually is in a lot of pain.
[5483.70 - 5485.70] P:1881.54 E:0.024222 |  He's actually covering up his face with his shirt.
[5485.70 - 5488.70] P:1800.87 E:0.028120 |  Previously, of course, he had been feeling the effects of what looked
[5488.70 - 5491.70] P:1767.51 E:0.028465 |  like his hamstring. Just to say as well, the England player is now
[5491.70 - 5494.70] P:1737.89 E:0.025424 |  taking on a drinks break at this opportunity.
[5494.70 - 5498.70] P:1802.94 E:0.025475 |  And Ross Barclay has finally got the instruction that I'd mentioned
[5498.70 - 5501.70] P:1625.93 E:0.028121 |  from Gary Neville. So, Reign Rooney is playing on the left,
[5501.70 - 5504.70] P:1690.47 E:0.028075 |  Barclay in a central position and Sterling on the England right.
[5504.70 - 5507.70] P:1754.20 E:0.022540 |  And Sterling now is back on his feet. Alan?
[5507.70 - 5511.70] P:1709.01 E:0.024141 |  Sterling has to leave the field of play, of course,
[5511.70 - 5515.70] P:1678.88 E:0.025165 |  having received treatment, but he'll be the right-sided player
[5515.70 - 5519.70] P:1616.61 E:0.025715 |  of the three behind Sterridge in the remaining 25 minutes of the game.
[5519.70 - 5522.70] P:1663.45 E:0.024742 |  You're listening to five live in the BBC, 20 minutes gone in the
[5522.70 - 5525.70] P:1643.77 E:0.024681 |  second half. England won 8-0-2.
[5525.70 - 5528.70] P:1661.95 E:0.026695 |  He's got a lead through Marquesio, within two minutes,
[5528.70 - 5531.70] P:1572.92 E:0.024352 |  Sterridge in equalised, and then five minutes after the half-time
[5531.70 - 5535.70] P:1609.95 E:0.024772 |  interval, Balotelli with a simple unmarked header at the far post,
[5535.70 - 5538.70] P:1760.07 E:0.025009 |  restored Italy's advantage.
[5538.70 - 5542.70] P:1583.98 E:0.024676 |  Sterling is now back on the pitch. The game has resumed.
[5542.70 - 5545.70] P:1665.17 E:0.025866 |  And the ball is with Stephen Jarrod inside the centre circle.
[5545.70 - 5549.70] P:1683.77 E:0.024555 |  Whip pass to the left side to Baines, into Rooney.
[5549.70 - 5552.70] P:1680.93 E:0.025599 |  Barclay makes a run forward. Rooney passes wide, though, to Sterling.
[5552.70 - 5555.70] P:1628.61 E:0.024624 |  And the ball is accurate from Wayne Rooney. Sterling controls it.
[5555.70 - 5558.70] P:1664.86 E:0.022836 |  Back to Glenn Johnson. Johnson to Henderson.
[5558.70 - 5561.70] P:1663.29 E:0.025178 |  Henderson with Barclay available. Barclay static for the moment,
[5561.70 - 5565.70] P:1679.11 E:0.025366 |  but the pass goes to him anyway, and Barclay slips it wide to Sterling.
[5565.70 - 5568.70] P:1659.50 E:0.024615 |  Down the far side, England needs some pace urgently.
[5568.70 - 5572.70] P:1728.75 E:0.026957 |  Sterling beats one defender. His pass is going under the
[5572.70 - 5576.70] P:1752.48 E:0.028400 |  penalty chair, so it's easily knocked away by Fletcher behind for a corner.
[5576.70 - 5579.70] P:1907.74 E:0.028239 |  England has got to gamble a little bit more. When those crosses are going
[5579.70 - 5583.70] P:1734.66 E:0.023586 |  to the box, at the moment, there's really only one player,
[5583.70 - 5587.70] P:1739.51 E:0.022785 |  one white shirt in that area. People have got to gamble,
[5587.70 - 5590.70] P:1780.20 E:0.027276 |  run across the face of people. You might not always get the ball yourself,
[5590.70 - 5593.70] P:1678.91 E:0.024318 |  but it draws the attention of the other defenders.
[5593.70 - 5597.70] P:1569.88 E:0.025843 |  Baines to take the corner from the right. He'll hit it left footed.
[5597.70 - 5601.70] P:1696.76 E:0.027001 |  When he's happy, he places the ball in the quadrant now.
[5601.70 - 5605.70] P:1725.01 E:0.027405 |  Cahill is up inside the penalty area. Jarrod is there.
[5605.70 - 5608.70] P:1727.99 E:0.026909 |  Here it comes from Baines. Deep, and it's an easy catch for
[5608.70 - 5611.70] P:1878.33 E:0.028106 |  Sidergoo, the Italian goalkeeper.
[5611.70 - 5615.70] P:1832.45 E:0.025318 |  I'll say again, our set piece has been poor from England.
[5615.70 - 5618.70] P:1661.32 E:0.024864 |  We saw them, obviously, at Wembley, where they did incredibly well
[5618.70 - 5622.70] P:1782.15 E:0.023368 |  from set pieces, got a couple of goals, but this evening,
[5622.70 - 5624.70] P:1642.08 E:0.024042 |  delivery hasn't been good enough.
[5624.70 - 5628.70] P:1712.27 E:0.024790 |  Bellatelli from Pirlo's pass on the halfway line into the England half,
[5628.70 - 5633.70] P:1711.97 E:0.023903 |  and passes backwards to Chiellini. He exchanges passes with Fletcher.
[5633.70 - 5636.70] P:1654.44 E:0.024768 |  If he are happy, no, just slow things down.
[5636.70 - 5639.70] P:1777.39 E:0.026903 |  All the talk was about Pirlo, wasn't it? He was going to control the game,
[5639.70 - 5643.70] P:1729.50 E:0.024905 |  and it's actually been Camdreva down this right-hand side, along with
[5643.70 - 5646.70] P:1705.13 E:0.027578 |  Damien. We've caused all the problems and Ballaté's hitter.
[5646.70 - 5651.70] P:1639.48 E:0.024329 |  Pirlo has been good, but nowhere near what we thought he would be.
[5651.70 - 5654.70] P:1678.85 E:0.025483 |  It's with Fletcher. Fletcher sweeps it towards the near side.
[5654.70 - 5659.70] P:1640.58 E:0.024800 |  Damien controls the ball, down off his right thigh, into De Rossi.
[5659.70 - 5665.70] P:1576.74 E:0.023179 |  And England, wow. I'm just wondering if the heat is getting to them a little bit now.
[5665.70 - 5667.70] P:1801.00 E:0.025857 |  There's no excuse, having realistically.
[5667.70 - 5670.70] P:1714.12 E:0.027074 |  Italy, I've got to deal with the same conditions.
[5670.70 - 5673.70] P:1717.12 E:0.026842 |  It's not as hot and humid as we possibly expected.
[5673.70 - 5675.70] P:1656.37 E:0.028332 |  Yes, it will be energies happening.
[5675.70 - 5679.70] P:1757.53 E:0.027647 |  When you don't have the ball, it does make it doubly difficult.
[5680.70 - 5683.70] P:1761.09 E:0.028487 |  We'll go back to Ian Jenison after that, we'll be making.
[5684.70 - 5687.70] P:1923.68 E:0.024636 |  Just quickly, Jack Wil...
[5687.70 - 5691.70] P:1909.45 E:0.027688 |  Jack Wilsh was going through an extended warm-up behind the goal here.
[5691.70 - 5693.70] P:1834.84 E:0.024817 |  So I think that we've already seen you off-parking.
[5693.70 - 5696.70] P:1782.44 E:0.025468 |  Jack Wilsh may well be the next England player to be brought on in the next few minutes.
[5698.70 - 5706.70] P:1683.43 E:0.024848 |  Italy 2, England 1, and, you know, there's been quite a lot to admire about England tonight going forward,
[5706.70 - 5708.70] P:1689.16 E:0.026343 |  but it's the older Killy's heel, I'm afraid.
[5708.70 - 5710.70] P:1594.59 E:0.025571 |  There's always going to be a problem at this highest level,
[5710.70 - 5713.70] P:1657.82 E:0.026042 |  whether they would be able to defend well enough.
[5713.70 - 5715.70] P:1661.74 E:0.026187 |  But they've certainly shown more enterprise going forward.
[5715.70 - 5718.70] P:1685.83 E:0.026301 |  They've had plenty of shots at the Italian goal,
[5718.70 - 5720.70] P:1722.14 E:0.025166 |  and there is still time to get something from this game.
[5720.70 - 5724.70] P:1681.68 E:0.025799 |  Gerard now looking for Sterling over on the far side,
[5724.70 - 5726.70] P:1714.11 E:0.025013 |  and Sterling's there with the possession.
[5726.70 - 5727.70] P:1741.75 E:0.024300 |  Barkley makes a move.
[5727.70 - 5730.70] P:1789.56 E:0.025432 |  Sterling now, can he dink this one in, though he can't get past Killy?
[5730.70 - 5732.70] P:1876.31 E:0.026407 |  And of course, one of the problems with Sterling
[5732.70 - 5736.70] P:1829.23 E:0.025684 |  is he missed out on that final preparation going in the heat in Miami.
[5736.70 - 5738.70] P:1872.37 E:0.026786 |  So he is feeling the heat.
[5738.70 - 5741.70] P:1982.34 E:0.027578 |  He could be getting a yellow card here, I think.
[5741.70 - 5743.70] P:2043.67 E:0.026126 |  Might be the first of the game.
[5743.70 - 5746.70] P:1926.69 E:0.024777 |  It could be Gary Cahill, and the referees just...
[5746.70 - 5749.70] P:1858.73 E:0.024538 |  I'll be interested to what our callers think.
[5749.70 - 5755.70] P:1773.19 E:0.022598 |  They can phone in, obviously, 0-500-996-95, or text 85058.
[5755.70 - 5757.70] P:1809.92 E:0.026901 |  You know, all the talk is about bring the youth,
[5757.70 - 5759.70] P:1779.92 E:0.023511 |  bring the young players to this tournament.
[5759.70 - 5762.70] P:1727.44 E:0.024983 |  I said all along, if you want to do well in this tournament,
[5762.70 - 5764.70] P:1658.68 E:0.023865 |  I would have brought John Terry.
[5764.70 - 5769.70] P:1731.53 E:0.022942 |  I would implored to try and drag him out of retirement.
[5769.70 - 5774.70] P:1719.19 E:0.022152 |  Spain of the night suffered massively because of Poyol was missing.
[5774.70 - 5776.70] P:1743.12 E:0.024758 |  You know, they got exposed hugely.
[5776.70 - 5779.70] P:1809.27 E:0.023135 |  Experiencing that centre-half area is absolutely vital.
[5779.70 - 5780.70] P:1682.20 E:0.023278 |  I'd have brought Ashley Cull.
[5780.70 - 5782.70] P:1757.26 E:0.024206 |  Not saying letting Bainters play badly,
[5782.70 - 5785.70] P:1762.61 E:0.023206 |  but Ashley Cull's experience might have been able to deal with it
[5785.70 - 5786.70] P:1809.21 E:0.026959 |  slightly different.
[5786.70 - 5787.70] P:1792.23 E:0.024113 |  So England got to lose this.
[5787.70 - 5790.70] P:1675.52 E:0.025342 |  We'd love to hear what all the fans watching back home
[5790.70 - 5795.70] P:1735.33 E:0.024254 |  have got to say. 0-500-909-693-85058 on the text.
[5795.70 - 5798.70] P:1755.11 E:0.023302 |  Gary Cahill didn't get a yellow card,
[5798.70 - 5803.70] P:1799.30 E:0.026311 |  so England now at walking pace, just inside the Italian half.
[5803.70 - 5805.70] P:1815.27 E:0.027037 |  The ball is left to Henderson.
[5805.70 - 5806.70] P:1729.87 E:0.028600 |  It's 2-1 to Italy.
[5806.70 - 5808.70] P:1877.04 E:0.025774 |  Italy, for the most part, in the second half,
[5808.70 - 5810.70] P:1854.27 E:0.025981 |  have been playing on the counter-attack.
[5810.70 - 5813.70] P:1871.90 E:0.025552 |  It's now Johnson running towards the area, a very congested area,
[5813.70 - 5815.70] P:1755.36 E:0.024922 |  and nothing at the end of it from Johnson.
[5815.70 - 5817.70] P:1817.18 E:0.022344 |  He just ran into a blue tunnel there,
[5817.70 - 5819.70] P:1761.67 E:0.023930 |  and Italy looking to clear a chip from Marquisio,
[5819.70 - 5821.70] P:1789.41 E:0.025233 |  which Gerrard intercepts,
[5821.70 - 5825.70] P:1703.78 E:0.024976 |  and now Phil Jagi Elker inside the Italian half, onto Runi.
[5825.70 - 5828.70] P:1845.44 E:0.025215 |  Runi's got four Italian players with him.
[5828.70 - 5831.70] P:1656.64 E:0.024107 |  Runi now releases the ball square for Jordan Henderson,
[5831.70 - 5833.70] P:1633.25 E:0.025599 |  Sterling available down the right-hand side.
[5833.70 - 5836.70] P:1609.93 E:0.025344 |  Sturridge and Runi in the area, 2-1 to Italy on five-line.
[5836.70 - 5840.70] P:1718.07 E:0.025561 |  Johnson, all given away by Johnson, but not cleared by Italy.
[5840.70 - 5841.70] P:1756.82 E:0.022151 |  Henderson has a chance.
[5841.70 - 5843.70] P:1746.75 E:0.024254 |  Gerrard, the captain's calling for it.
[5843.70 - 5846.70] P:1651.06 E:0.024188 |  Jenderson, because Gerrard could see Sterling in space.
[5846.70 - 5848.70] P:1611.63 E:0.024759 |  Instead, gives it to Johnson.
[5848.70 - 5850.70] P:1603.16 E:0.025339 |  But the Italians have got everybody back,
[5850.70 - 5852.70] P:1765.70 E:0.026374 |  as England try and release Sterling in the area
[5852.70 - 5854.70] P:1795.66 E:0.026157 |  and win a corner kick in the end of Caletta,
[5854.70 - 5856.70] P:1925.78 E:0.025366 |  a corner to England now.
[5856.70 - 5859.70] P:1860.18 E:0.025782 |  Danny Mills has been saying that we will be going pitchside
[5859.70 - 5861.70] P:1688.24 E:0.025098 |  to Ian Danyson and Mellon, but England have a corner.
[5861.70 - 5864.70] P:1684.84 E:0.024114 |  Got to make better delivery.
[5864.70 - 5865.70] P:1703.86 E:0.025317 |  That's been a problem.
[5865.70 - 5867.70] P:1683.13 E:0.025727 |  The delivery hasn't been good enough in so far,
[5867.70 - 5869.70] P:1772.26 E:0.024749 |  and England, they've struggled.
[5869.70 - 5871.70] P:1768.43 E:0.025217 |  They're so congested in that middle area.
[5871.70 - 5875.70] P:1766.39 E:0.025107 |  The Italian defence, so well-drilled, well-organised,
[5875.70 - 5877.70] P:1820.50 E:0.024787 |  individually very, very good as well.
[5877.70 - 5880.70] P:1807.75 E:0.026618 |  England just have to move the ball maybe a little bit quicker,
[5880.70 - 5883.70] P:1609.81 E:0.024573 |  get it wider a little bit earlier, and maybe get some crosses in.
[5883.70 - 5885.70] P:1772.89 E:0.023729 |  We're going to have a couple of substitutions.
[5885.70 - 5887.70] P:1728.95 E:0.026964 |  I'm not sure if they'll make this before the corner.
[5887.70 - 5890.70] P:1730.37 E:0.024958 |  They don't normally, so we'll have this corner kicked to England
[5890.70 - 5892.70] P:1785.17 E:0.025983 |  over on the far side, which Baines will take,
[5892.70 - 5894.70] P:1656.05 E:0.025215 |  and then we'll have an Italian substitution
[5894.70 - 5896.70] P:1698.85 E:0.025351 |  and also an England substitution.
[5896.70 - 5898.70] P:1790.67 E:0.025313 |  Jack Wilshire coming on in the moment.
[5898.70 - 5900.70] P:1794.62 E:0.025663 |  Corner to England, two-one, they trail.
[5900.70 - 5902.70] P:1806.38 E:0.025304 |  And it goes headed on at the near post by Gary Cahill,
[5902.70 - 5904.70] P:1703.19 E:0.024268 |  and they've got another corner.
[5904.70 - 5906.70] P:1688.03 E:0.024450 |  So Baines is still over there preparing to take this corner.
[5906.70 - 5908.70] P:1618.20 E:0.024809 |  And he's got a little bit of a lead on the heel
[5908.70 - 5910.70] P:1571.00 E:0.023326 |  at the near post, trying his luck.
[5910.70 - 5912.70] P:1740.62 E:0.026517 |  The Italians just holding on to Rooney at the moment
[5912.70 - 5914.70] P:1661.15 E:0.024810 |  as he stands in front of the goalkeeper.
[5914.70 - 5917.70] P:1586.97 E:0.023304 |  There's no space down there at all.
[5917.70 - 5919.70] P:1707.47 E:0.024905 |  So, corner to England, taken short.
[5919.70 - 5922.70] P:1657.07 E:0.023374 |  Baines now, can he cut this one in from the right-hand side?
[5922.70 - 5924.70] P:1803.58 E:0.024308 |  He's given it to Glenn Johnson.
[5924.70 - 5926.70] P:1765.87 E:0.024849 |  Johnson takes the shot, and it's wide,
[5926.70 - 5928.70] P:1678.78 E:0.026795 |  and here's Ian Dennis' pitch side.
[5928.70 - 5930.70] P:1919.53 E:0.026844 |  Jack Wilshire on in the third substitution.
[5930.70 - 5932.70] P:1785.07 E:0.026522 |  Mike is likely to be Adam Lallard,
[5932.70 - 5934.70] P:1797.00 E:0.027463 |  because he's now going through that same extensive warm-up
[5934.70 - 5936.70] P:1752.22 E:0.025712 |  with the goal that I'm sat behind.
[5936.70 - 5938.70] P:1724.21 E:0.028199 |  And this is going to be a regular feature for England at the World Cup
[5938.70 - 5940.70] P:1845.99 E:0.024247 |  throughout this tournament.
[5940.70 - 5942.70] P:1645.12 E:0.027693 |  Pitch side on five-live, giving you all the insight
[5942.70 - 5944.70] P:1619.13 E:0.022840 |  as the game goes on.
[5946.70 - 5948.70] P:1858.23 E:0.026340 |  Well, the Italian substitution will be made first,
[5948.70 - 5950.70] P:1923.92 E:0.024397 |  and they have shown them...
[5950.70 - 5953.70] P:1918.65 E:0.026820 |  Yes, Ballatelli, who scored the second goal, is coming off.
[5953.70 - 5957.70] P:2060.78 E:0.027725 |  And he will be replaced by Immobili of Torino,
[5957.70 - 5960.70] P:1996.28 E:0.027206 |  who is the top scorer in Serie A last season with 22 goals.
[5960.70 - 5962.70] P:2027.82 E:0.025985 |  So he comes on.
[5962.70 - 5964.70] P:2005.09 E:0.023517 |  He's number 17.
[5964.70 - 5967.70] P:1972.53 E:0.024291 |  Jack Wilshire, number seven, preparing to come on for England
[5967.70 - 5970.70] P:1886.60 E:0.022738 |  and to replace Jordan Henderson, Danny.
[5970.70 - 5972.70] P:1946.32 E:0.023877 |  Well, I think Ballatelli,
[5972.70 - 5974.70] P:1752.83 E:0.024700 |  apart from his goal, hasn't done an awful lot.
[5974.70 - 5976.70] P:1793.37 E:0.025400 |  He's held the ball up well at times.
[5976.70 - 5979.70] P:1826.55 E:0.024005 |  It hasn't caused too many problems for England,
[5979.70 - 5981.70] P:1835.87 E:0.023646 |  but they're just putting on a strike with fresh legs.
[5981.70 - 5983.70] P:1834.19 E:0.023906 |  Obviously, Wilshire coming on is probably going to play
[5983.70 - 5986.70] P:1842.11 E:0.023975 |  a little bit more forward than Jordan Henderson,
[5986.70 - 5990.70] P:1833.45 E:0.025309 |  and they'll be looking to him to play those little balls through.
[5990.70 - 5993.70] P:1862.31 E:0.021367 |  Similar, I expect, that they expect Pirlo to do.
[5993.70 - 5996.70] P:1838.38 E:0.023160 |  Get the ball, dink it over the defence,
[5996.70 - 5999.70] P:1804.46 E:0.023637 |  maybe play little slide-rule balls down the sides of defenders
[5999.70 - 6001.70] P:1725.40 E:0.024628 |  for those England players to run onto.
[6001.70 - 6003.70] P:1604.75 E:0.023280 |  Sunday morning now back home.
[6003.70 - 6007.70] P:1602.89 E:0.024480 |  It's half past seven in the evening here in the Nauce.
[6007.70 - 6010.70] P:1649.97 E:0.026313 |  We have 17 minutes to go.
[6010.70 - 6012.70] P:1649.19 E:0.028172 |  It's 2-1 to Italy.
[6012.70 - 6014.70] P:1781.52 E:0.026350 |  They went in front through Marquisio.
[6014.70 - 6016.70] P:1737.35 E:0.022178 |  England equalised two minutes later from Sturridge,
[6016.70 - 6018.70] P:1648.29 E:0.025379 |  and in the second half, Ballatelli has headed in.
[6018.70 - 6021.70] P:1687.03 E:0.025888 |  The second Italian goal, and in the aftermath of the England goal
[6021.70 - 6025.70] P:1769.91 E:0.023541 |  and the celebrations, Gary Lewin, the physiotherapist, was injured,
[6025.70 - 6027.70] P:1627.18 E:0.021059 |  and we understand has a suspected broken ankle
[6027.70 - 6030.70] P:1608.49 E:0.022498 |  and was carried off on a stretcher.
[6030.70 - 6033.70] P:1735.24 E:0.026929 |  Now, Stephen Geroff-Ringel onto Jack Wilshire, his first touch.
[6033.70 - 6035.70] P:1800.83 E:0.020624 |  Wilshire now to Baines,
[6035.70 - 6038.70] P:1729.29 E:0.023541 |  and Stirling, I think, has pulled up over on the far side.
[6038.70 - 6040.70] P:1841.40 E:0.025216 |  England can make one more change.
[6040.70 - 6042.70] P:1753.14 E:0.025238 |  That pass from Jagie Elka was almost under hit,
[6042.70 - 6045.70] P:1728.43 E:0.021610 |  and it's a very slow pace about the game now.
[6045.70 - 6048.70] P:1756.62 E:0.022715 |  Not surprisingly, after the heat earlier on.
[6048.70 - 6051.70] P:1688.02 E:0.024843 |  Long one now from Geroff, seeking out Baines down below us.
[6051.70 - 6054.70] P:1698.18 E:0.021966 |  Layton Baines with a couple of Italians breathing down his neck,
[6054.70 - 6057.70] P:1682.43 E:0.023566 |  finds Jack Wilshire, Barclays offering himself,
[6057.70 - 6059.70] P:1810.48 E:0.027471 |  and it goes from Wilshire to Barclay.
[6059.70 - 6061.70] P:1714.92 E:0.022964 |  Barclay now square ball to Geroff.
[6061.70 - 6064.70] P:1607.04 E:0.025240 |  Stirling is wide on the right. Sturridge is moving around.
[6064.70 - 6067.70] P:1681.72 E:0.023942 |  The ball goes to Johnson, now onto Raheem Stirling.
[6067.70 - 6069.70] P:1682.63 E:0.024237 |  Stirling faced by Marquisio,
[6069.70 - 6072.70] P:1713.25 E:0.023776 |  and now all the Italian players now are back behind the ball.
[6072.70 - 6075.70] P:1698.45 E:0.025624 |  It's going to be very difficult for England here to open them up.
[6075.70 - 6077.70] P:1752.45 E:0.024063 |  Wilshire again onto Stirling.
[6077.70 - 6080.70] P:1639.17 E:0.024470 |  The Italians all under line now waiting for this ball to come in.
[6080.70 - 6082.70] P:1635.29 E:0.024777 |  It's Glenn Johnson, 30 yards out,
[6082.70 - 6084.70] P:1646.84 E:0.023818 |  drags the ball back to Jagie Elka.
[6084.70 - 6087.70] P:1732.66 E:0.024872 |  Now it's Rooney. England trying to go forward,
[6087.70 - 6089.70] P:1662.96 E:0.025932 |  but a great blue wall in the way.
[6089.70 - 6091.70] P:1802.54 E:0.024000 |  Baines now for England, 2-1, they trail here.
[6091.70 - 6093.70] P:1639.67 E:0.025787 |  Oh, Baines has given that away almost,
[6093.70 - 6095.70] P:1659.03 E:0.021807 |  but Jagie Elka is going to help him out.
[6095.70 - 6097.70] P:1745.01 E:0.023828 |  Jagie Elka thought about the back pass,
[6097.70 - 6099.70] P:1707.49 E:0.024149 |  plays it forward now to Rooney.
[6099.70 - 6102.70] P:1677.24 E:0.025603 |  And maybe need to put it down that far side.
[6102.70 - 6105.70] P:1733.64 E:0.026475 |  Stephen Gerrard's got a problem in the middle of the pitch.
[6105.70 - 6107.70] P:1739.35 E:0.026026 |  I don't know whether he's gone over on his ankle,
[6107.70 - 6110.70] P:1739.24 E:0.025389 |  whether it's cramp, he's holding his left knee ankle.
[6110.70 - 6112.70] P:1665.97 E:0.025807 |  He's got a problem.
[6112.70 - 6114.70] P:1741.37 E:0.023984 |  He hasn't moved for 30, 40 seconds now,
[6114.70 - 6116.70] P:1733.40 E:0.023544 |  just trying to flex his knee, I think.
[6116.70 - 6118.70] P:1768.37 E:0.025842 |  Ross Bartley to Glenn Johnson.
[6118.70 - 6120.70] P:1866.64 E:0.026578 |  Sturridge up against Keelini, that's going to be a free kick to England.
[6120.70 - 6123.70] P:1809.69 E:0.024398 |  Sturridge has been fouled on the edge of the penalty area.
[6123.70 - 6126.70] P:1750.05 E:0.023298 |  And Stephen Gerrard now is just stretching.
[6126.70 - 6128.70] P:1626.46 E:0.023786 |  And he's got a problem.
[6128.70 - 6130.70] P:1794.91 E:0.023336 |  He's got a problem.
[6130.70 - 6132.70] P:1712.54 E:0.023207 |  Whatever the problem, he had a sort of hamstring injury,
[6132.70 - 6134.70] P:1659.40 E:0.024175 |  I think it was there in the week.
[6134.70 - 6136.70] P:1767.18 E:0.021998 |  Certainly a groin injury, which prevented him from taking part
[6136.70 - 6138.70] P:1753.83 E:0.025404 |  in training in the early part of the week.
[6138.70 - 6140.70] P:1751.99 E:0.024191 |  But he won't want to leave the action here.
[6140.70 - 6142.70] P:1751.67 E:0.023795 |  But he's a terribly draining condition here for the players.
[6142.70 - 6144.70] P:1704.79 E:0.023378 |  England can only make one more change.
[6144.70 - 6147.70] P:1730.00 E:0.023848 |  We think Sterling is slightly handicapped as well.
[6147.70 - 6149.70] P:1752.66 E:0.024086 |  Now, Layton Baines has been given a pretty
[6149.70 - 6152.70] P:1722.95 E:0.023206 |  torrid night down this left-hand side defensively.
[6152.70 - 6155.70] P:1787.59 E:0.023617 |  Can he pop up with a free kick here?
[6155.70 - 6158.70] P:1720.28 E:0.023988 |  And Sturridge is limping as well,
[6158.70 - 6160.70] P:1782.33 E:0.024769 |  towards the penalty area.
[6160.70 - 6162.70] P:1801.88 E:0.025392 |  I think Sturridge just went down with cramp as well.
[6162.70 - 6164.70] P:1936.39 E:0.025685 |  That is down to the hot conditions.
[6164.70 - 6166.70] P:1804.07 E:0.025519 |  The play is not able to get on enough fluid.
[6166.70 - 6168.70] P:1765.73 E:0.025435 |  Well, I remember Gerrard scoring for Liverpool
[6168.70 - 6170.70] P:1715.28 E:0.022369 |  in the FA Cup final when he was hobbling.
[6170.70 - 6175.70] P:1807.44 E:0.023579 |  That dramatic 3-3 goal in Cardiff.
[6175.70 - 6177.70] P:1859.83 E:0.022940 |  It's Gerrard to the left of the ball,
[6177.70 - 6179.70] P:1814.51 E:0.025533 |  and Baines to the right.
[6179.70 - 6182.70] P:1908.42 E:0.025557 |  25 yards from goal probably favours the left footer.
[6182.70 - 6184.70] P:1864.14 E:0.021866 |  I think it's going to have to be something very special
[6184.70 - 6186.70] P:1796.66 E:0.024000 |  to beat Syragoo from this distance.
[6186.70 - 6188.70] P:1690.25 E:0.025676 |  Gerrard is walking away,
[6188.70 - 6191.70] P:1757.35 E:0.024372 |  and it will be left to Everton's left back, Layton Baines.
[6191.70 - 6193.70] P:1777.77 E:0.026002 |  Can he get this one over the wall
[6193.70 - 6195.70] P:1836.28 E:0.025998 |  and get England back into the game? They're trailing 2-1.
[6195.70 - 6197.70] P:1834.69 E:0.027715 |  Here goes Baines.
[6197.70 - 6199.70] P:1792.49 E:0.026613 |  Oh, good save by the goalkeeper, Syragoo.
[6199.70 - 6202.70] P:1879.70 E:0.025774 |  Turns it away for a corner kick to the far side.
[6202.70 - 6205.70] P:1850.38 E:0.024851 |  Baines denied by the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper,
[6205.70 - 6208.70] P:1713.08 E:0.024612 |  the deputy for Buffon, who's done very well this evening.
[6208.70 - 6211.70] P:1698.54 E:0.022661 |  And it's a corner to England over on the far side.
[6211.70 - 6213.70] P:1756.12 E:0.023372 |  Baines gets back into his defensive position now.
[6213.70 - 6215.70] P:1669.86 E:0.024690 |  England need a goal from somewhere.
[6215.70 - 6217.70] P:1609.19 E:0.023006 |  Can they knock one in now from the corner?
[6217.70 - 6220.70] P:1792.47 E:0.028627 |  Oh, it's a terrible, terrible corner from Rooney.
[6220.70 - 6223.70] P:1826.37 E:0.028102 |  He just scoos away behind the goal for a...
[6223.70 - 6225.70] P:1783.60 E:0.027303 |  A goal kick to Italy.
[6225.70 - 6227.70] P:1811.93 E:0.025579 |  You've talked about the set pieces tonight, Donny,
[6227.70 - 6229.70] P:1739.57 E:0.025848 |  but that was the worst of all.
[6229.70 - 6231.70] P:1733.06 E:0.023825 |  Yeah, that was a little bit unfortunate.
[6231.70 - 6234.70] P:1773.92 E:0.023502 |  It's standing for his left foot, just gave way as he went to kick that.
[6234.70 - 6236.70] P:1645.25 E:0.022895 |  Nothing he can do about that.
[6236.70 - 6238.70] P:1580.17 E:0.024476 |  Remember David Beckham's penalty course
[6238.70 - 6240.70] P:1677.03 E:0.020818 |  when he stepped a big turf came up.
[6240.70 - 6242.70] P:1655.36 E:0.023793 |  It was similar to that. Nothing Wayne Rooney could have done that.
[6242.70 - 6245.70] P:1553.47 E:0.022990 |  The set pieces and delivery hasn't been good enough this evening.
[6245.70 - 6248.70] P:1728.03 E:0.023925 |  England players feeling the heat, trailing 2-1 to Italy,
[6248.70 - 6250.70] P:1717.52 E:0.022687 |  and chasing the game is going to be difficult
[6250.70 - 6253.70] P:1796.36 E:0.021796 |  in these last 30 minutes on five-live.
[6253.70 - 6256.70] P:1713.26 E:0.022582 |  De Rossi hasn't strayed very far forward this evening.
[6256.70 - 6259.70] P:1779.14 E:0.023729 |  De Rossi down the centre, touched off by Marquisio.
[6259.70 - 6261.70] P:1828.44 E:0.023619 |  Now here's Mota. Mota.
[6261.70 - 6264.70] P:1826.99 E:0.024876 |  And here's the danger man down this right-hand side, Damian.
[6264.70 - 6268.70] P:1793.39 E:0.023845 |  They now have, immobilise, of course, in the penalty area.
[6268.70 - 6270.70] P:1713.79 E:0.021026 |  Anatoly having been replaced.
[6270.70 - 6273.70] P:1698.34 E:0.024594 |  Italy just playing it short. Mota. Brazilian born.
[6273.70 - 6276.70] P:1700.25 E:0.024315 |  And playing in this Brazilian World Cup for Italy.
[6276.70 - 6279.70] P:1742.29 E:0.025034 |  We're going to have another change in the moment for Italy.
[6279.70 - 6282.70] P:1792.54 E:0.024941 |  As Jaguilca slides the ball out of defence,
[6282.70 - 6285.70] P:1724.01 E:0.022297 |  and Sterling now tries to set off against Keelini.
[6285.70 - 6288.70] P:1735.07 E:0.022234 |  It goes to Sturridge. Oh, Sturridge plays that back to Glenn Johnson.
[6288.70 - 6291.70] P:1517.74 E:0.022950 |  He didn't seem to be expecting it. Johnson's now being hustled by immobilise.
[6291.70 - 6293.70] P:1652.04 E:0.022442 |  Johnson now, down the right-hand side of the field.
[6293.70 - 6295.70] P:1579.76 E:0.024764 |  He needs support. There's nobody with him at all.
[6295.70 - 6298.70] P:1798.68 E:0.021358 |  Gets the call in the end from Wilshire.
[6298.70 - 6300.70] P:1747.73 E:0.021563 |  And England build from the back from Steven Gerrard
[6300.70 - 6303.70] P:1673.37 E:0.022062 |  is trying to run off this injury that we think he's picked up.
[6303.70 - 6305.70] P:1562.94 E:0.022387 |  England now with Bains.
[6305.70 - 6307.70] P:1712.27 E:0.025894 |  Another Italian change coming in just a moment.
[6307.70 - 6309.70] P:1794.03 E:0.021282 |  That'll be their third and final change.
[6309.70 - 6311.70] P:1744.97 E:0.025763 |  Wilshire just inside the Italy half,
[6311.70 - 6314.70] P:1779.16 E:0.026869 |  and time starting to run us a dreadful ball to the far side
[6314.70 - 6317.70] P:1961.48 E:0.026970 |  towards Glenn Johnson, and England are flagging here.
[6317.70 - 6319.70] P:1895.77 E:0.025757 |  Back to Ian Dennis' pitchside.
[6319.70 - 6322.70] P:1787.69 E:0.025048 |  And as we predicted from our pitchside position,
[6322.70 - 6325.70] P:1704.81 E:0.026215 |  Adam Milana is about to come on for England,
[6325.70 - 6327.70] P:1712.29 E:0.027195 |  and that will be England's third and final substitution.
[6327.70 - 6329.70] P:1846.10 E:0.018983 |  Mike.
[6329.70 - 6331.70] P:1885.04 E:0.024285 |  Thank you.
[6331.70 - 6333.70] P:1733.46 E:0.027816 |  Perolo will also come on for Italy,
[6333.70 - 6336.70] P:1771.82 E:0.026277 |  and England will be really pleased to see the back of this guy.
[6336.70 - 6339.70] P:1801.49 E:0.026997 |  Can Draver, who's had a really excellent match,
[6339.70 - 6342.70] P:1818.53 E:0.025812 |  he's tormented England down the right-hand side.
[6342.70 - 6345.70] P:1856.56 E:0.026513 |  So he's walking off Antonio Can Draver,
[6345.70 - 6348.70] P:1880.42 E:0.026355 |  and he'll be replaced by another relatively inexperienced player,
[6348.70 - 6350.70] P:1788.94 E:0.024172 |  Perolo.
[6350.70 - 6354.70] P:1751.62 E:0.025572 |  And England's final change then will be Adam Milana coming on.
[6354.70 - 6356.70] P:1590.85 E:0.027562 |  Surely it has to be...
[6356.70 - 6358.70] P:1668.97 E:0.021248 |  It's not Sterling, it's Sturridge coming off.
[6358.70 - 6361.70] P:1567.69 E:0.027713 |  We think that Sterling's got a problem,
[6361.70 - 6363.70] P:1678.42 E:0.027795 |  but maybe it's Sturridge now who's...
[6363.70 - 6366.70] P:1680.37 E:0.026508 |  He's jogging off quite gingerly, isn't he?
[6366.70 - 6369.70] P:1709.30 E:0.025398 |  He did go down with a cramp after that foul.
[6369.70 - 6372.70] P:1811.56 E:0.025436 |  Maybe, you know, he's just given way inside of the...
[6372.70 - 6374.70] P:1544.58 E:0.027161 |  He can't carry on, but that's a blow for England,
[6374.70 - 6377.70] P:1631.35 E:0.026494 |  because, you know, he is one of our hottest, brighter strikers.
[6377.70 - 6381.70] P:1672.47 E:0.024882 |  Scored a great goal on the half volley to make it 1-1 in the first half,
[6381.70 - 6383.70] P:1719.84 E:0.023765 |  two minutes after England have gone behind.
[6383.70 - 6385.70] P:1696.40 E:0.024115 |  England do at least have impact players
[6385.70 - 6387.70] P:1556.19 E:0.028296 |  to bring on Langler-Larner and Barclay and Walsher.
[6387.70 - 6390.70] P:1614.48 E:0.026131 |  And now Perolo gets his first touch for it.
[6390.70 - 6393.70] P:1528.36 E:0.026470 |  2-1, they lead here, and we're starting to run out of time.
[6393.70 - 6395.70] P:1556.33 E:0.025090 |  There's over 10 minutes to go.
[6395.70 - 6398.70] P:1690.45 E:0.026468 |  Italy now with Damian down the right-hand side.
[6398.70 - 6400.70] P:1606.36 E:0.023881 |  Immobilise calling for it. Goes to Marquisio.
[6400.70 - 6403.70] P:1643.07 E:0.027256 |  Marquisio's ball in should be cleared by Giancarlo.
[6403.70 - 6405.70] P:1561.46 E:0.026433 |  He's taking his time.
[6405.70 - 6408.70] P:1494.49 E:0.026064 |  Now finds Sterling over on the right-hand side.
[6408.70 - 6412.70] P:1604.82 E:0.024902 |  Don't forget you'll be able to hear all the follow-ups to this game tonight
[6412.70 - 6414.70] P:1791.85 E:0.023517 |  on Gary Richardson's Sports Week tomorrow morning.
[6414.70 - 6416.70] P:1628.69 E:0.023633 |  He's got Harry Rednap on the program.
[6416.70 - 6419.70] P:1671.20 E:0.022178 |  He's got Ray Clements, the former England goalkeeper,
[6419.70 - 6421.70] P:1764.11 E:0.026286 |  and also at the moment the man who's going to be happiest of all,
[6421.70 - 6423.70] P:1779.46 E:0.025285 |  Roberto Di Matteo.
[6423.70 - 6426.70] P:1660.37 E:0.026118 |  So that's Sports Week with Gary Richardson on five-live later today.
[6426.70 - 6428.70] P:1495.78 E:0.023701 |  Of course, it's now Sunday. And here's Layton Baines,
[6428.70 - 6430.70] P:1660.21 E:0.025470 |  wide on the England left.
[6430.70 - 6432.70] P:1731.96 E:0.025461 |  Rooney's now playing down the centre.
[6432.70 - 6434.70] P:1760.22 E:0.025840 |  He's played wide right, wide left. He's now down the centre.
[6434.70 - 6438.70] P:1758.44 E:0.025765 |  Barclay over to Raheem Sterling. Johnson on the overlap.
[6438.70 - 6440.70] P:1780.94 E:0.025560 |  Rooney's waiting in the area.
[6440.70 - 6443.70] P:1718.13 E:0.026221 |  And it's a terrible ball from Johnson.
[6443.70 - 6447.70] P:1793.60 E:0.025607 |  It's the end product once again that's missing from that right back.
[6447.70 - 6449.70] P:1868.44 E:0.026858 |  And just when Roy Hodgeson looked at his face,
[6449.70 - 6452.70] P:1730.30 E:0.026396 |  he looked so downbeat in that moment.
[6452.70 - 6456.70] P:1692.64 E:0.026702 |  That was a good chance for England to trouble the Italian defenders.
[6456.70 - 6458.70] P:1774.10 E:0.023953 |  Just seeing the attendance flash up.
[6458.70 - 6460.70] P:1823.98 E:0.024326 |  39,000, I think the stadium holds 42,
[6460.70 - 6463.70] P:1743.83 E:0.024572 |  so not a bad turnout here in the heat this evening.
[6463.70 - 6466.70] P:1782.36 E:0.024884 |  But again, I just like to, you know, the lines are open.
[6466.70 - 6468.70] P:1655.69 E:0.025373 |  0500, 999, 693.
[6468.70 - 6470.70] P:1793.87 E:0.027113 |  Would really like to hear, you know,
[6470.70 - 6473.70] P:1866.93 E:0.024128 |  what England fans make of this performance.
[6473.70 - 6477.70] P:1860.93 E:0.022498 |  You know, I think Roy Hodgeson has done pretty much everything he possibly can.
[6477.70 - 6479.70] P:1831.89 E:0.023812 |  You know, he's changed it tactically. He's been attacking.
[6479.70 - 6481.70] P:1772.31 E:0.023536 |  He's given the young players a chance.
[6481.70 - 6483.70] P:1765.21 E:0.021222 |  But what has been the difference?
[6483.70 - 6487.70] P:1867.63 E:0.022613 |  What do England fans think the difference between these two sides has been?
[6487.70 - 6491.70] P:1928.40 E:0.024525 |  Well, for me, it's been the difference that I must admit.
[6491.70 - 6495.70] P:1701.81 E:0.025688 |  I think we all anticipated that when it came to the very highest level,
[6495.70 - 6498.70] P:1912.79 E:0.027015 |  would England be able to defend well enough without John Terry,
[6498.70 - 6500.70] P:1847.27 E:0.025912 |  without Ashley Cole now?
[6500.70 - 6502.70] P:1931.63 E:0.026287 |  And, well, they've been found wanting,
[6502.70 - 6504.70] P:1723.89 E:0.024903 |  and the Italians have put better delivery in as well.
[6504.70 - 6506.70] P:1820.17 E:0.024034 |  I mean, compare that Glenn Johnson delivery
[6506.70 - 6509.70] P:1755.03 E:0.026901 |  with some of the Italian balls from the right-hand side.
[6509.70 - 6512.70] P:1711.89 E:0.025109 |  But there's still time. England trailing 2-1.
[6512.70 - 6514.70] P:1820.65 E:0.025482 |  But they have to do something quickly here.
[6514.70 - 6516.70] P:1802.64 E:0.023904 |  Barclay now with his great body strength going forward,
[6516.70 - 6519.70] P:1764.18 E:0.025564 |  and then he's going to overrun that and take on too many Italians.
[6519.70 - 6522.70] P:1874.00 E:0.025372 |  And the Italians, how ambitious will they be now as they counterattack?
[6522.70 - 6524.70] P:1870.19 E:0.026719 |  They know they lead 2-1.
[6524.70 - 6527.70] P:1933.39 E:0.025478 |  They're going to go globally now, and the England are stretched.
[6527.70 - 6530.70] P:1874.77 E:0.025909 |  England don't have enough defenders back, but that's gone off Gary Cahill.
[6530.70 - 6534.70] P:1754.16 E:0.024722 |  And Joe Hart intercepts, but hey, we're almost stranded there, Danny.
[6534.70 - 6536.70] P:1697.91 E:0.026265 |  Nearly got caught on the counterattack. England pushing forward now,
[6536.70 - 6538.70] P:1814.80 E:0.024264 |  taking a little bit of a chance.
[6538.70 - 6540.70] P:1696.24 E:0.024836 |  Interesting. You just mentioned Pirlo.
[6540.70 - 6542.70] P:1679.05 E:0.024991 |  He's the first time you've mentioned him in maybe 10 minutes.
[6542.70 - 6544.70] P:1727.96 E:0.024400 |  He's hardly touched the ball.
[6544.70 - 6547.70] P:1615.00 E:0.026008 |  No, he hasn't dominated the game in the way that he did two years ago.
[6547.70 - 6550.70] P:1686.40 E:0.025991 |  But other Italians have really caught the eye this evening.
[6550.70 - 6552.70] P:1661.98 E:0.027028 |  Baratti was on the pitch, looked good,
[6552.70 - 6554.70] P:1806.19 E:0.023581 |  and he's probably the most eye-catching combination,
[6554.70 - 6558.70] P:1728.44 E:0.025963 |  Damian and Candreva, relatively unknown players down the Italian right.
[6558.70 - 6561.70] P:1730.51 E:0.025531 |  Now, here comes Raheem Sterling, who started the game behind Sterridge.
[6561.70 - 6564.70] P:1620.14 E:0.026196 |  Sterling is well-guarded, though, by Tirolo.
[6564.70 - 6567.70] P:1742.67 E:0.026073 |  Sterling tries to dink the ball in, and again,
[6567.70 - 6569.70] P:1794.56 E:0.026555 |  it's another disappointing cross from the right.
[6569.70 - 6571.70] P:1846.04 E:0.026886 |  Nothing for Rooney to feed off.
[6571.70 - 6573.70] P:1793.29 E:0.027543 |  Or Barclay, it's an Italian goal kick,
[6573.70 - 6576.70] P:1680.05 E:0.025858 |  and they're taking plenty of time, of course, over this.
[6576.70 - 6579.70] P:1595.57 E:0.025413 |  We have 8 minutes to go, and Italy, despite their desperate build-up,
[6579.70 - 6582.70] P:1662.99 E:0.026467 |  they didn't win a single friendly game after World Cup qualification,
[6582.70 - 6587.70] P:1722.38 E:0.027410 |  and they were held 1-1 by Luxembourg in their last game before the World Cup.
[6587.70 - 6590.70] P:1716.68 E:0.028815 |  Come the tournament, and nearly always get it right.
[6590.70 - 6593.70] P:1785.01 E:0.027659 |  And at the moment, they're heading for three points to join Costa Rica,
[6593.70 - 6599.70] P:1769.90 E:0.026763 |  and it may be that they'll have to win both of their remaining matches to qualify.
[6599.70 - 6601.70] P:1664.67 E:0.026425 |  It's going to make it very, very difficult now, isn't it?
[6601.70 - 6604.70] P:1740.85 E:0.026592 |  Very, very tough, but as we said, the Italian is very, very experienced.
[6604.70 - 6607.70] P:1825.06 E:0.028167 |  We know how good they are when it comes to tournament football.
[6607.70 - 6611.70] P:1814.63 E:0.025828 |  England now, I think it's Gary Kay, he'll gone down on the far side with Cramp.
[6611.70 - 6614.70] P:1781.26 E:0.028353 |  Well, they're suffering much more than the Italians.
[6614.70 - 6615.70] P:1841.18 E:0.027954 |  Well, this is what I don't understand.
[6615.70 - 6617.70] P:1788.70 E:0.026527 |  I've just looked at the statistics.
[6617.70 - 6622.70] P:1792.40 E:0.025224 |  This is 52% possession in favour of the Italians.
[6622.70 - 6624.70] P:1789.25 E:0.027000 |  So not massively different.
[6624.70 - 6627.70] P:1794.08 E:0.026754 |  The Italian team, I believe, are based in the south,
[6627.70 - 6630.70] P:1813.16 E:0.025922 |  right down in the south as well, where it's much, much cooler.
[6630.70 - 6633.70] P:1845.10 E:0.025178 |  I think all three Italian games are up in the north,
[6633.70 - 6635.70] P:1728.47 E:0.025362 |  so they will have problems.
[6635.70 - 6640.70] P:1748.48 E:0.025461 |  The Italian players are older, pretty much, you know, than the England players.
[6640.70 - 6643.70] P:1856.50 E:0.025284 |  And we've had five or six England players go down with Cramp and are struggling.
[6643.70 - 6645.70] P:1794.98 E:0.027301 |  Didn't we call any Italian?
[6645.70 - 6646.70] P:1640.40 E:0.027451 |  No, there isn't.
[6646.70 - 6648.70] P:1771.54 E:0.023569 |  As we said, not one Italian has gone down so far.
[6648.70 - 6653.70] P:1814.55 E:0.026175 |  Italy two, England one on five live in this opening game of the World Cup.
[6653.70 - 6655.70] P:1710.99 E:0.024389 |  All is not lost, but there are still two more matches to go,
[6655.70 - 6657.70] P:1812.04 E:0.026481 |  but England now would love an equaliser.
[6657.70 - 6660.70] P:1881.85 E:0.027120 |  As Lallana is clattered on the edge of the area.
[6660.70 - 6663.70] P:1873.44 E:0.027062 |  Now then, if England have a way back here, it has to be pretty soon.
[6663.70 - 6665.70] P:1714.52 E:0.024147 |  We've got six minutes to go.
[6665.70 - 6668.70] P:1734.56 E:0.024807 |  This free kick, Rooney's grabbed the ball already.
[6668.70 - 6670.70] P:1689.40 E:0.023946 |  Baines is there as well.
[6670.70 - 6672.70] P:1800.63 E:0.025812 |  Gerard might lurk as well.
[6672.70 - 6674.70] P:1672.74 E:0.021888 |  He's got a fantastic shot, obviously.
[6674.70 - 6677.70] P:1591.55 E:0.023948 |  But England so far this evening with their set pieces,
[6677.70 - 6680.70] P:1583.64 E:0.024300 |  in particular their corners have been disappointing.
[6680.70 - 6683.70] P:1644.69 E:0.023541 |  But can they strike this one past Sirigou?
[6683.70 - 6687.70] P:1665.98 E:0.025979 |  Trailing two-one with around about six minutes to go.
[6687.70 - 6689.70] P:1548.01 E:0.027355 |  Rooney's in the centre of the three at the moment.
[6689.70 - 6691.70] P:1705.47 E:0.026834 |  I think Gerard might strike this.
[6691.70 - 6693.70] P:1654.01 E:0.027289 |  David Fome has gone down by the ball,
[6693.70 - 6695.70] P:1693.09 E:0.028204 |  which was instantly rubbed away by Steven Gerard.
[6695.70 - 6698.70] P:1714.04 E:0.027590 |  Could this be the big moment for the captain, Gerard?
[6698.70 - 6701.70] P:1725.54 E:0.027833 |  He's scored at two previous World Cups.
[6701.70 - 6704.70] P:1806.60 E:0.027336 |  He's certainly having a long look at this ball.
[6704.70 - 6709.70] P:1863.52 E:0.026182 |  Baines is there just to try and confuse the Italian defenders.
[6709.70 - 6711.70] P:1807.45 E:0.025973 |  There's a little bit of manhandling going on.
[6711.70 - 6713.70] P:1782.04 E:0.024922 |  It's well in the penalty area.
[6713.70 - 6716.70] P:1809.68 E:0.025814 |  Lallana's being grabbed around, but now Gerard concentrates.
[6716.70 - 6718.70] P:1724.91 E:0.026277 |  And Gerard takes it, it's over the bar.
[6718.70 - 6720.70] P:1741.50 E:0.026357 |  It just would not come down for him.
[6720.70 - 6723.70] P:1904.43 E:0.025099 |  Well struck, almost two.
[6723.70 - 6725.70] P:1838.69 E:0.025042 |  Just not quite good enough.
[6725.70 - 6727.70] P:1823.34 E:0.024769 |  It ended up in the middle of the guy.
[6727.70 - 6728.70] P:1744.89 E:0.026501 |  I think had it been low enough,
[6728.70 - 6731.70] P:1688.79 E:0.023105 |  I think Sirigou might have had that one covered.
[6731.70 - 6734.70] P:1622.62 E:0.024313 |  And I'm pretty sure now the Italians are going to play for time.
[6734.70 - 6737.70] P:1638.71 E:0.025707 |  England's starting to look tired, looking weary.
[6737.70 - 6740.70] P:1657.21 E:0.026562 |  You know, players physically absolutely exhausted.
[6740.70 - 6742.70] P:1667.21 E:0.025726 |  They've done well in points.
[6742.70 - 6745.70] P:1770.52 E:0.024874 |  They're one of the first half, got back in the game very, very quickly.
[6745.70 - 6749.70] P:1711.68 E:0.023155 |  But they haven't been able to cope with this threat down.
[6749.70 - 6752.70] P:1705.77 E:0.023004 |  Italy's right-hand side, England's left-hand side.
[6752.70 - 6754.70] P:1672.34 E:0.023075 |  That has been the problem all night long.
[6754.70 - 6756.70] P:1801.84 E:0.024924 |  Roy Hodgson, I believe, did his best.
[6756.70 - 6759.70] P:1769.36 E:0.023238 |  You know, changed the tactics, has changed personnel,
[6759.70 - 6760.70] P:1568.05 E:0.023152 |  but still it hasn't worked.
[6760.70 - 6764.70] P:1647.25 E:0.024824 |  And that's why I like to hear the call as 0-500-996-93
[6764.70 - 6766.70] P:1699.33 E:0.024956 |  to what they think of Roy Hodgson's selections.
[6766.70 - 6769.70] P:1745.84 E:0.025461 |  Here's Johnson again giving the ball away, not decisive enough.
[6769.70 - 6773.70] P:1690.43 E:0.025079 |  That was an obvious pass to Runi, and it was under hit as well.
[6773.70 - 6774.70] P:1787.87 E:0.023724 |  It wasn't played with conviction.
[6774.70 - 6776.70] P:1816.71 E:0.026200 |  And it opens up England again now potentially,
[6776.70 - 6777.70] P:1841.82 E:0.024972 |  as Immobilie has it.
[6777.70 - 6781.70] P:1791.46 E:0.024416 |  Immobilie now, across to this near side, this dangerous right-hand side,
[6781.70 - 6784.70] P:1726.59 E:0.024293 |  but they switch the ball back to Barzagli in defence.
[6784.70 - 6787.70] P:1709.04 E:0.026522 |  The goal which may decide this game, scored by Mario Ballatelli,
[6787.70 - 6791.70] P:1770.57 E:0.026798 |  whose future is very uncertain in Italy, when they see Milan.
[6791.70 - 6795.70] P:1820.50 E:0.027189 |  Perolo now looking for one for Immobilie to chase, but it's offside.
[6795.70 - 6797.70] P:1813.19 E:0.022424 |  And England have a free kick.
[6797.70 - 6801.70] P:1733.33 E:0.023575 |  And there is nothing like the pace of the game earlier on here this evening.
[6801.70 - 6803.70] P:1660.07 E:0.023132 |  There's two sides that run themselves into the ground,
[6803.70 - 6805.70] P:1781.97 E:0.022840 |  but it looks like at the moment Italy are going to collect
[6805.70 - 6807.70] P:1789.78 E:0.023261 |  the three valuable points.
[6807.70 - 6809.70] P:1686.54 E:0.025141 |  Big difference is the two left-back areas.
[6809.70 - 6811.70] P:1784.16 E:0.022770 |  You know, Leighton-Baines has been exposed, two-on-one,
[6811.70 - 6812.70] P:1625.55 E:0.027423 |  not all of his own doing.
[6812.70 - 6814.70] P:1760.69 E:0.024444 |  They're going to turn from Ross Barclay in the meantime.
[6814.70 - 6817.70] P:1867.06 E:0.025314 |  Ross Barclay still moving towards the penalty area, very congested.
[6817.70 - 6820.70] P:1779.81 E:0.026187 |  Runi takes over, and it's a terrible strike in the end for Runi.
[6820.70 - 6823.70] P:1804.00 E:0.025621 |  He got right underneath it and lifts the ball into the England fans.
[6823.70 - 6826.70] P:1698.32 E:0.024649 |  He had a great chance as well, did Runi in the second half,
[6826.70 - 6827.70] P:1751.34 E:0.021938 |  which he put wide.
[6827.70 - 6831.70] P:1751.89 E:0.021913 |  It's another goal kick, another opportunity, away for England.
[6831.70 - 6833.70] P:1719.56 E:0.026495 |  Wainwright is just trying a little bit too hard, but go back to that.
[6833.70 - 6836.70] P:1727.72 E:0.024131 |  The two left-backs, Keelini has not been exposed once,
[6836.70 - 6841.70] P:1637.28 E:0.023260 |  not the quickest, but nobody really has got the ball and run at him.
[6841.70 - 6846.70] P:1695.55 E:0.022333 |  Yes, he's a very, very good defender, playing out of position at left-back,
[6846.70 - 6848.70] P:1708.05 E:0.026738 |  but no one's trying to expose him at all.
[6848.70 - 6851.70] P:1755.49 E:0.023648 |  Well, at least it will be cooler at the other two venues
[6851.70 - 6855.70] P:1815.12 E:0.026226 |  for the Uruguay game in Sattalo, the Costa Rica game in Vela Horizonte,
[6855.70 - 6858.70] P:1741.70 E:0.021072 |  and now England with Adam Lallano.
[6858.70 - 6860.70] P:1873.43 E:0.026633 |  They made all their three changes.
[6860.70 - 6862.70] P:1741.88 E:0.025328 |  Here's another of the substitutes, Jack Walsh.
[6862.70 - 6864.70] P:1663.38 E:0.025571 |  Walsh to Gerard.
[6864.70 - 6869.70] P:1778.00 E:0.025895 |  All the Italians filtering back once more to make life incredibly difficult
[6869.70 - 6870.70] P:1826.97 E:0.028212 |  here for England.
[6870.70 - 6872.70] P:1917.74 E:0.025115 |  Gerard now to the far side of the field and Johnson.
[6872.70 - 6875.70] P:1770.47 E:0.023461 |  Now can Johnson provide something here, but it's a walking pace.
[6875.70 - 6877.70] P:1742.89 E:0.023669 |  Sterling is pointing.
[6877.70 - 6879.70] P:1744.31 E:0.023223 |  It's absolute walking pace here.
[6879.70 - 6880.70] P:1613.37 E:0.022311 |  This isn't going to open up the Italians.
[6880.70 - 6882.70] P:1713.78 E:0.023676 |  Sterling again into Barclay.
[6882.70 - 6883.70] P:1757.74 E:0.023352 |  It's going to take something pretty special.
[6883.70 - 6886.70] P:1746.18 E:0.025464 |  Ross Barclay, little extravagant prick from Lallano.
[6886.70 - 6889.70] P:1803.11 E:0.026187 |  Didn't work at all and England need more than that.
[6889.70 - 6891.70] P:1839.33 E:0.022976 |  Ball is out of play and it's going to be an England throw.
[6891.70 - 6892.70] P:1734.46 E:0.024667 |  Quickly taken.
[6892.70 - 6895.70] P:1788.36 E:0.024610 |  We've got just over two minutes of normal time to go.
[6895.70 - 6897.70] P:1867.46 E:0.025726 |  As Jagi Elka finds Rumi.
[6897.70 - 6901.70] P:1884.15 E:0.026243 |  Two onto Italy on five-life and Raheem Sterling.
[6901.70 - 6904.70] P:1850.82 E:0.026348 |  Now Sterling with a little bit of a bustle
[6904.70 - 6905.70] P:1772.35 E:0.024594 |  and still Sterling with a bustle.
[6905.70 - 6908.70] P:1807.26 E:0.026037 |  Sterling in the end and that's gone off the defender.
[6908.70 - 6912.70] P:1864.78 E:0.026720 |  Barclay, I think it was for a corner kick to England over on the far side.
[6912.70 - 6917.70] P:1823.26 E:0.024603 |  The set pieces haven't been good, but now can the captain deliver with this corner?
[6917.70 - 6919.70] P:1780.73 E:0.025177 |  Steven Gerard, far side of the right.
[6919.70 - 6920.70] P:1737.49 E:0.022032 |  Needs to be better.
[6920.70 - 6923.70] P:1524.54 E:0.024156 |  This is the moment that the players come up from the back.
[6923.70 - 6926.70] P:1765.23 E:0.025120 |  Cahill, Jagi Elka, Barclay, Rumi in there.
[6926.70 - 6927.70] P:1795.90 E:0.021166 |  Get this delivery right.
[6927.70 - 6930.70] P:1601.45 E:0.026056 |  Caused those Italian defenders all sorts of problems.
[6930.70 - 6934.70] P:1812.14 E:0.023878 |  Lallano and Jagi Elka and Cahill are all in the six-yard area.
[6934.70 - 6936.70] P:1820.34 E:0.024493 |  It's the usual scene here against the Italian defenders.
[6936.70 - 6939.70] P:1856.48 E:0.023237 |  A lot of shoving and in goes the corner kick.
[6939.70 - 6942.70] P:1881.50 E:0.025539 |  A big leap from Rumi, but the Italians will head it out of the penalty area.
[6942.70 - 6944.70] P:1892.92 E:0.024231 |  Comes out to Jack Wilshire.
[6944.70 - 6945.70] P:1862.98 E:0.024528 |  Wilshire heads it forward.
[6945.70 - 6948.70] P:1800.00 E:0.023644 |  England have to scramble the ball back now through Baines.
[6948.70 - 6951.70] P:1686.18 E:0.025460 |  It's slightly wayward from him to Johnson over on the far side.
[6951.70 - 6954.70] P:1685.49 E:0.022576 |  And we just have over a minute of normal time to go.
[6954.70 - 6956.70] P:1649.98 E:0.021688 |  Gerard for Johnson.
[6956.70 - 6958.70] P:1592.53 E:0.025387 |  The Italians are certainly for this now.
[6958.70 - 6960.70] P:1660.68 E:0.023211 |  They've got everybody back inside their own half.
[6960.70 - 6964.70] P:1660.10 E:0.023754 |  And of course, they are masters at denying opposition.
[6964.70 - 6969.70] P:1730.38 E:0.024206 |  Barclay, Barclay onto Wayne Rumi, surrounded by Italian blue.
[6969.70 - 6971.70] P:1731.08 E:0.023325 |  Back to Baines once more.
[6971.70 - 6973.70] P:1619.08 E:0.025854 |  Gary Cahill is in the penalty area.
[6973.70 - 6974.70] P:1857.44 E:0.024731 |  Ross Barclay again now.
[6974.70 - 6976.70] P:1755.81 E:0.023418 |  Barclay trying to pick up past a Sterling.
[6976.70 - 6978.70] P:1448.34 E:0.027110 |  Sterling up against Perla.
[6978.70 - 6981.70] P:1739.85 E:0.025858 |  Sterling wide and tired in the end.
[6981.70 - 6985.70] P:1798.88 E:0.025241 |  And that's gone wide and in this tough group for England.
[6985.70 - 6987.70] P:1793.66 E:0.025513 |  I think it's the first time ever in World Cup history
[6987.70 - 6991.70] P:1727.34 E:0.025285 |  that we have three former World Cup winners in the group.
[6991.70 - 6993.70] P:1642.74 E:0.022528 |  Uruguay, Italy and England.
[6993.70 - 6996.70] P:1674.36 E:0.025536 |  And England are starting its seams with defeat.
[6996.70 - 6999.70] P:1789.62 E:0.026506 |  30 seconds to go and maybe a couple of minutes of added time.
[6999.70 - 7002.70] P:1728.77 E:0.024444 |  Major difference for me, Mike, is England's attack.
[7002.70 - 7004.70] P:1744.03 E:0.025214 |  When we've talked about this left-hand side,
[7004.70 - 7007.70] P:1629.20 E:0.026336 |  that's been a problem for England all night long.
[7007.70 - 7009.70] P:1657.58 E:0.028811 |  But there's been no real plan for England,
[7009.70 - 7011.70] P:1776.84 E:0.025479 |  I think, when they've gone forward.
[7011.70 - 7014.70] P:1792.76 E:0.026197 |  They've relied on individuals to try and come up with something.
[7014.70 - 7016.70] P:1743.67 E:0.026625 |  There's been no real pattern of play.
[7016.70 - 7019.70] P:1825.98 E:0.023719 |  Whereas Italy, clearly, they've been trying to get the ball,
[7019.70 - 7022.70] P:1742.21 E:0.025890 |  dink it in behind, play balls down the side of people.
[7022.70 - 7024.70] P:1677.15 E:0.024018 |  There was a definite plan to Italy's attack.
[7024.70 - 7027.70] P:1642.25 E:0.025863 |  Whereas I think England have almost said,
[7027.70 - 7029.70] P:1755.58 E:0.026261 |  look, they're good players individually.
[7029.70 - 7031.70] P:1829.27 E:0.024152 |  Just go and play and try and create something on your own,
[7031.70 - 7033.70] P:1677.10 E:0.023609 |  rather than have a set plan.
[7033.70 - 7035.70] P:1557.19 E:0.025669 |  But there's been no real time.
[7035.70 - 7037.70] P:1709.32 E:0.026338 |  There's five minutes of added time.
[7037.70 - 7039.70] P:1861.51 E:0.028727 |  As Gerard finds Adam Lallana.
[7039.70 - 7042.70] P:1773.04 E:0.025453 |  Well, ball from Lallana was really poor behind Jack Wilshire.
[7042.70 - 7044.70] P:1756.68 E:0.025177 |  And England get the possession away,
[7044.70 - 7047.70] P:1884.29 E:0.026313 |  and Perla with that slide-rule pass finds Mota.
[7047.70 - 7050.70] P:1939.38 E:0.027249 |  And it's offside against Immobilie over on the far side.
[7050.70 - 7053.70] P:1917.43 E:0.024950 |  Just before all that, there was a very, very tired clearance
[7053.70 - 7056.70] P:1839.47 E:0.023037 |  from Gary Cahill, who really seems to be laboring now
[7056.70 - 7059.70] P:1952.32 E:0.024221 |  with this cramped free kick to England.
[7059.70 - 7061.70] P:1825.75 E:0.021921 |  And it's touched off to Wilshire.
[7061.70 - 7063.70] P:1726.33 E:0.023948 |  And the pass from Lallana wasn't good enough.
[7063.70 - 7065.70] P:1803.78 E:0.022322 |  And now Leighton Baines.
[7065.70 - 7067.70] P:1800.91 E:0.024338 |  Baines back again to Gerard on the half-way line.
[7067.70 - 7069.70] P:1777.84 E:0.024609 |  Two-one to Italy, and we're playing
[7069.70 - 7071.70] P:1751.72 E:0.025956 |  five minutes of added time here in Manass.
[7071.70 - 7074.70] P:1764.36 E:0.024881 |  Now, Johnson poised down the right-hand side.
[7074.70 - 7076.70] P:1835.24 E:0.025528 |  And again, he fails to get past the first defender.
[7076.70 - 7078.70] P:1810.51 E:0.022812 |  Johnson finds Jack Wilshire.
[7078.70 - 7079.70] P:1825.44 E:0.025521 |  Wilshire scampers forward.
[7079.70 - 7081.70] P:1807.44 E:0.024927 |  Wilshire's going forward. He's partially tackled.
[7081.70 - 7083.70] P:1735.15 E:0.026153 |  Rooney picks up the loose ball.
[7083.70 - 7085.70] P:1800.11 E:0.023877 |  It may make his way to Sterling over on the far side.
[7085.70 - 7087.70] P:1783.93 E:0.023684 |  Now, can Sterling measure a cross hit to somebody?
[7087.70 - 7089.70] P:1769.07 E:0.024016 |  Not really.
[7089.70 - 7092.70] P:1837.20 E:0.027184 |  But he's getting a far post in the Italians' clear.
[7092.70 - 7095.70] P:1907.23 E:0.025742 |  That final ball from England wants more, letting them down.
[7095.70 - 7099.70] P:1797.60 E:0.023264 |  Baines with the throw-in and thrown down to Barclay.
[7099.70 - 7102.70] P:1765.14 E:0.025096 |  Barclay nudges the ball into Wilshire.
[7102.70 - 7104.70] P:1773.87 E:0.023338 |  That's such a congested area.
[7104.70 - 7106.70] P:1828.43 E:0.025970 |  Wilshire went past a couple of players, but not the third.
[7106.70 - 7108.70] P:1909.63 E:0.029011 |  And now, Perlowe's bringing the ball.
[7108.70 - 7110.70] P:1928.67 E:0.027173 |  Cahill didn't make the challenge.
[7110.70 - 7112.70] P:1765.98 E:0.025488 |  Perlowe again, he's just holding this,
[7112.70 - 7114.70] P:1837.96 E:0.025805 |  and then works it down the left-hand side.
[7114.70 - 7117.70] P:1924.22 E:0.028017 |  Sterling's backtracking, and that's really disappointing for England
[7117.70 - 7121.70] P:1964.54 E:0.028283 |  because he's got a yellow card for the foul on Perlowe.
[7121.70 - 7124.70] P:2031.02 E:0.026498 |  Dutch referee showing the first yellow card of the night
[7124.70 - 7126.70] P:1972.92 E:0.025609 |  to an England player to Raheem Sterling,
[7126.70 - 7129.70] P:1899.00 E:0.024384 |  and this just buys Italy more time.
[7129.70 - 7131.70] P:1885.36 E:0.024972 |  They weren't really going anywhere.
[7131.70 - 7133.70] P:2004.42 E:0.024004 |  No, they were a fair play to Raheem Sterling.
[7133.70 - 7136.70] P:1859.71 E:0.023197 |  He did chase back 50, 60 yards in injury time.
[7136.70 - 7138.70] P:1866.96 E:0.021971 |  Just tried to make it.
[7138.70 - 7141.70] P:1801.79 E:0.023170 |  It was a tired tackle. Just tried to put his foot out and nick the ball.
[7141.70 - 7143.70] P:1831.60 E:0.025491 |  Just a little bit slow, and that's down maybe
[7143.70 - 7145.70] P:1671.58 E:0.024085 |  to the heat and tiredness for him.
[7145.70 - 7148.70] P:1763.47 E:0.024366 |  England looking shattered now on their knees.
[7148.70 - 7151.70] P:1747.19 E:0.026544 |  They haven't been outplayed by Italy tonight,
[7151.70 - 7154.70] P:1866.37 E:0.022909 |  but there have been those crucial moments which have cost them.
[7154.70 - 7156.70] P:1709.33 E:0.019936 |  That's exactly right, Mike.
[7156.70 - 7158.70] P:1835.01 E:0.024554 |  There's not an England player that's played badly this evening.
[7158.70 - 7161.70] P:1749.79 E:0.026358 |  No one has really set the place on fire,
[7161.70 - 7164.70] P:1731.75 E:0.024582 |  but I think when it's come down to those big moments,
[7164.70 - 7166.70] P:1706.95 E:0.026365 |  Italy have just been a little bit better.
[7166.70 - 7169.70] P:1819.86 E:0.025463 |  Keelyne's hardly put a foot wrong at the backfritters this night.
[7169.70 - 7170.70] P:1831.83 E:0.026294 |  Now, De Rossi.
[7170.70 - 7172.70] P:1809.20 E:0.026249 |  It's not been tested, Mike.
[7172.70 - 7174.70] P:1893.96 E:0.027861 |  Nobody's got the ball.
[7174.70 - 7177.70] P:1965.84 E:0.026590 |  No one's got the ball and run it, Keelyne.
[7177.70 - 7180.70] P:1812.95 E:0.023955 |  He's not the most mobile. He's a fantastic defender.
[7180.70 - 7182.70] P:1835.82 E:0.025652 |  I think he would be brilliant in the Premier League,
[7182.70 - 7184.70] P:1829.13 E:0.026813 |  but no one has got the ball and run it in.
[7184.70 - 7186.70] P:1808.34 E:0.025746 |  They say, come on, let's have a race.
[7186.70 - 7189.70] P:1829.53 E:0.027400 |  He hasn't been tested all evening long,
[7189.70 - 7192.70] P:1880.92 E:0.025090 |  whereas Leighton Baines constantly tested,
[7192.70 - 7194.70] P:1812.59 E:0.027003 |  not only with it as an individual,
[7194.70 - 7196.70] P:1819.03 E:0.022288 |  but also with two-on-one situations as well.
[7196.70 - 7199.70] P:1852.23 E:0.025390 |  Well, it was a big call to leave that Ashley Cole.
[7199.70 - 7202.70] P:1790.74 E:0.024584 |  Baines has had quite a baptism tonight in the World Cup.
[7202.70 - 7206.70] P:1791.57 E:0.026097 |  Andrew Perlow has got a free kick for Italy 30 yards away.
[7206.70 - 7208.70] P:1790.49 E:0.023702 |  And obviously, the Italian fans in the stadium
[7208.70 - 7210.70] P:1701.67 E:0.025668 |  hoping that he can provide the garnish here.
[7210.70 - 7212.70] P:1799.29 E:0.025457 |  3-1 would flatter them, I think, on the evening.
[7212.70 - 7214.70] P:1871.01 E:0.027326 |  It's a long, long way out, though.
[7214.70 - 7217.70] P:1711.01 E:0.025527 |  Joe Hart, who hasn't really had that much to do
[7217.70 - 7219.70] P:1605.83 E:0.025317 |  in the second half, waits,
[7219.70 - 7222.70] P:1831.30 E:0.029413 |  and Perlow shoots a goal and it clips up the crossbar.
[7222.70 - 7224.70] P:1869.32 E:0.027933 |  Hart was beaten.
[7224.70 - 7225.70] P:1912.64 E:0.028237 |  All ends up.
[7225.70 - 7227.70] P:1954.35 E:0.026893 |  And England rescued by the bar,
[7227.70 - 7229.70] P:1987.41 E:0.026038 |  and they have a goal kick,
[7229.70 - 7232.70] P:1991.83 E:0.026735 |  and they have a minute and a half to rescue this game.
[7232.70 - 7235.70] P:1892.23 E:0.024440 |  Joe Hart almost embarrassed.
[7235.70 - 7238.70] P:1904.99 E:0.025761 |  Unbelievable free kick from Andre Perlow.
[7238.70 - 7241.70] P:1861.15 E:0.024517 |  Outside of the right, but completely did Joe Hart.
[7241.70 - 7243.70] P:1862.79 E:0.023250 |  And at the last, the bit of swerve,
[7243.70 - 7245.70] P:1824.80 E:0.023115 |  Perlow knew exactly what he was doing
[7245.70 - 7247.70] P:1788.79 E:0.024613 |  and very, very unlucky to hit the crossbar.
[7247.70 - 7250.70] P:1782.36 E:0.022602 |  Last chance, maybe, now for England. Johnson into Rooney.
[7250.70 - 7252.70] P:1813.46 E:0.025022 |  Again, searching for his first World Cup goal.
[7252.70 - 7254.70] P:1790.48 E:0.024484 |  Rooney to Barclay.
[7254.70 - 7256.70] P:1903.93 E:0.025561 |  Good pass from Barclay to Sterling.
[7256.70 - 7258.70] P:1653.97 E:0.025185 |  Oh, Sterling's given that away cheaply towards Perlow.
[7258.70 - 7261.70] P:1700.85 E:0.023810 |  Perlow hasn't had a great header on the ball, though.
[7261.70 - 7263.70] P:1831.18 E:0.025812 |  Perlow heads it back to the reliable Kylini,
[7263.70 - 7265.70] P:1845.57 E:0.026558 |  and Perlow and Kylini closing the game out now
[7265.70 - 7267.70] P:1861.20 E:0.023288 |  in the left-back position.
[7267.70 - 7270.70] P:1737.58 E:0.026773 |  Italy leading 2-1 into the last minute of the five.
[7270.70 - 7271.70] P:1892.62 E:0.025919 |  Added time.
[7271.70 - 7274.70] P:1886.76 E:0.028486 |  Italy have the ball, and Perlow with a long pass
[7274.70 - 7275.70] P:1900.47 E:0.024550 |  seeks out Immobile.
[7275.70 - 7276.70] P:1832.82 E:0.023223 |  Gary Cahill was there,
[7276.70 - 7278.70] P:1820.21 E:0.023798 |  and there's precious little time to go now.
[7278.70 - 7280.70] P:1702.44 E:0.025542 |  England have to do something pretty miraculous.
[7280.70 - 7282.70] P:1806.86 E:0.024282 |  They're trailing 2-1.
[7282.70 - 7285.70] P:1889.30 E:0.024799 |  Adam Lallana now, in that very congested midfield.
[7285.70 - 7288.70] P:1856.66 E:0.024365 |  Lallana trying to turn, finds Gerard in midfield.
[7288.70 - 7289.70] P:1806.43 E:0.024523 |  Seconds to go now.
[7289.70 - 7291.70] P:1755.74 E:0.025836 |  The ball down the England right-hand side.
[7291.70 - 7293.70] P:1779.82 E:0.025048 |  They may get one more chance to whip this ball in.
[7293.70 - 7295.70] P:1814.86 E:0.025172 |  Here comes Johnson's cross.
[7295.70 - 7297.70] P:1758.96 E:0.026175 |  Went a long way, wasn't well delivered.
[7297.70 - 7299.70] P:1867.57 E:0.024488 |  Marquisio's back header is still in play.
[7299.70 - 7301.70] P:1826.94 E:0.023172 |  Baines needs some support down the left.
[7301.70 - 7302.70] P:1860.23 E:0.025440 |  He's got a throw in.
[7302.70 - 7305.70] P:1812.05 E:0.024468 |  We have 20 seconds of added time to go.
[7305.70 - 7307.70] P:1763.45 E:0.028185 |  England throw it, reared up at Lallana,
[7307.70 - 7309.70] P:1886.52 E:0.028548 |  and he couldn't control it, and Italy are on a break here,
[7309.70 - 7311.70] P:1966.73 E:0.028079 |  and this could be devastating
[7311.70 - 7313.70] P:1886.70 E:0.027058 |  unless England can get the players back.
[7313.70 - 7315.70] P:1877.09 E:0.028751 |  There's a Mowbley up against Gary Cahill.
[7315.70 - 7317.70] P:1917.15 E:0.028423 |  A Mowbley showing great post.
[7317.70 - 7320.70] P:1889.46 E:0.026659 |  Fantastic challenge of Cahill to deny a Mowbley.
[7320.70 - 7323.70] P:1868.38 E:0.026707 |  And I'm not sure it's going to be enough now for England.
[7323.70 - 7325.70] P:1896.32 E:0.027060 |  A Mowbley following an Italian throw
[7325.70 - 7327.70] P:1798.70 E:0.026825 |  is just taking the ball towards the corner flag.
[7327.70 - 7329.70] P:1757.98 E:0.025473 |  Time is up here in the Nass.
[7329.70 - 7332.70] P:1820.00 E:0.028440 |  We've been waiting for this for a very long time.
[7332.70 - 7334.70] P:1910.22 E:0.028818 |  All the attention from Roy Hunchin has been on this
[7334.70 - 7336.70] P:1956.89 E:0.027746 |  opening game against Italy.
[7336.70 - 7339.70] P:1938.52 E:0.027549 |  There was meticulous preparation in Florida,
[7339.70 - 7342.70] P:1968.56 E:0.027238 |  but on the night, England found Italy in the end.
[7342.70 - 7344.70] P:1923.97 E:0.027009 |  They were not to handle.
[7344.70 - 7347.70] P:1912.39 E:0.026185 |  They were exposed in areas when Italy went forward.
[7347.70 - 7349.70] P:1848.58 E:0.025129 |  There were some entertaining moments from England.
[7349.70 - 7351.70] P:1964.92 E:0.023639 |  A thrilling goal from Daniel Sturridge,
[7351.70 - 7354.70] P:1899.17 E:0.024730 |  but in the end it's a disappointing start to this World Cup campaign
[7354.70 - 7357.70] P:1919.62 E:0.025942 |  because the final score here, Italy 2, England 1.
[7364.70 - 7367.70] P:1836.60 E:0.025644 |  Yeah, disappointing for England.
[7367.70 - 7370.70] P:1778.89 E:0.023579 |  Devastating almost, but I think you have to say
[7370.70 - 7372.70] P:1768.60 E:0.024918 |  that the balance of play Italy probably deserved
[7372.70 - 7374.70] P:1737.90 E:0.023191 |  to win the game.
[7374.70 - 7376.70] P:1799.11 E:0.023581 |  They had the better chances.
[7376.70 - 7379.70] P:1772.17 E:0.022589 |  Pirlo hit the bar in injury time with a fantastic free kick.
[7379.70 - 7382.70] P:1875.29 E:0.022865 |  And obviously, Candreva hit the post
[7382.70 - 7384.70] P:1879.63 E:0.024282 |  just before half time as well.
[7384.70 - 7387.70] P:1839.92 E:0.023142 |  Ballatelli had one cleared off the line from Jaguilca.
[7387.70 - 7389.70] P:1854.35 E:0.021855 |  Nobody played bad for England,
[7389.70 - 7392.70] P:1802.81 E:0.024308 |  but nobody was absolutely brilliant.
[7392.70 - 7394.70] P:1787.89 E:0.025547 |  And England in those special moments,
[7394.70 - 7396.70] P:1877.39 E:0.023110 |  those defining moments of the game
[7396.70 - 7398.70] P:1701.19 E:0.025128 |  were just found a little bit wanting.
[7398.70 - 7400.70] P:1850.63 E:0.020598 |  And then there was a full-on
[7400.70 - 7402.70] P:1867.34 E:0.024258 |  and a full-on for the UK.
[7402.70 - 7404.70] P:1945.45 E:0.021474 |  It's a very, very good,
[7404.70 - 7407.70] P:1831.30 E:0.025391 |  but only for the left-hand side, England's struggle.
[7407.70 - 7410.70] P:1863.08 E:0.024976 |  It's not down to bad play from Leighton Baines.
[7410.70 - 7412.70] P:1917.69 E:0.024323 |  It got outnumbered two-on-one.
[7412.70 - 7414.70] P:1873.02 E:0.022684 |  Rooney didn't quite know where he was supposed to be
[7414.70 - 7416.70] P:1889.66 E:0.022754 |  in that first half.
[7416.70 - 7418.70] P:1911.45 E:0.028010 |  That may well have been a plan from Italy.
[7418.70 - 7420.70] P:2004.11 E:0.026117 |  Pirlo didn't run the game as expected.
[7420.70 - 7422.70] P:2028.14 E:0.025882 |  I said several times this week,
[7422.70 - 7424.70] P:1925.36 E:0.025530 |  don't be over-concerned with Pirlo.
[7424.70 - 7426.70] P:2040.55 E:0.023098 |  We don't need to worry about that.
[7426.70 - 7431.70] P:1933.32 E:0.023192 |  Keely didn't really go forward as much or anywhere near as much as Damian did.
[7431.70 - 7434.70] P:1891.12 E:0.023836 |  And Kandrej from that little pocket, that was a clear ploy.
[7434.70 - 7438.70] P:1909.12 E:0.023615 |  And Italy also looking to play balls in behind the England offence,
[7438.70 - 7445.70] P:1836.81 E:0.022326 |  flip balls over the top, whereas England were trying to rely on individual moments of magic.
[7445.70 - 7449.70] P:1773.47 E:0.024139 |  And that was the major difference. Let's go to Ian Dennis down in the tunnel.
[7449.70 - 7453.70] P:1468.24 E:0.025172 |  Yes, and at the mouth of the tunnel, the England player is just walking past me now,
[7453.70 - 7456.70] P:1581.16 E:0.024883 |  obviously you can see them all squirting profusely.
[7456.70 - 7459.70] P:1657.67 E:0.027288 |  We're going to get some reaction too from the England captain, Stephen Jeraab,
[7459.70 - 7461.70] P:1316.29 E:0.022701 |  because I actually think he's with Gabby Logan.
[7465.70 - 7469.70] P:1665.63 E:0.026344 |  He's not there yet, but that interview will be coming up very, very soon.
[7469.70 - 7476.70] P:1676.50 E:0.021063 |  And if I just have to hand back to you actually back in the commentary position.
[7476.70 - 7477.70] P:1514.10 E:0.023301 |  Thank you, Ian.
[7477.70 - 7483.70] P:1761.10 E:0.027665 |  I mean, England don't often win opening games in the World Cup,
[7483.70 - 7486.70] P:1773.12 E:0.028050 |  that happens very rarely, but they don't often lose them either.
[7486.70 - 7489.70] P:1750.74 E:0.024381 |  So this really is now an up-to-all task, isn't it?
[7489.70 - 7492.70] P:1616.03 E:0.026702 |  Uruguay next on Thursday, followed by Costa Rica, who beat Uruguay today.
[7492.70 - 7494.70] P:1739.44 E:0.028200 |  Well, it's now a must-win game, isn't it?
[7494.70 - 7497.70] P:1643.51 E:0.025272 |  It's going to be very, very difficult against Uruguay.
[7497.70 - 7501.70] P:1677.48 E:0.025669 |  Again, England have to win, again Uruguay have to win.
[7501.70 - 7506.70] P:1738.84 E:0.022226 |  So I think that the problem that will be, the problem will be,
[7506.70 - 7509.70] P:1703.41 E:0.026306 |  the fact that Louis Suarez is likely to play.
[7509.70 - 7512.70] P:1707.41 E:0.021282 |  We've seen how tired England players have been this evening.
[7512.70 - 7513.70] P:1647.68 E:0.022859 |  How are they going to recover?
[7513.70 - 7515.70] P:1775.87 E:0.024193 |  I think Ian, are we able to come to you now?
[7515.70 - 7516.70] P:1682.83 E:0.023292 |  Yes, sorry, Mike.
[7516.70 - 7521.70] P:1662.68 E:0.026168 |  I just had to speak to FIFA here in the tunnel about our after-match requests.
[7521.70 - 7524.70] P:1655.54 E:0.026339 |  But the players look drained as they're coming off.
[7524.70 - 7525.70] P:1617.48 E:0.031449 |  They look physically exhausted.
[7525.70 - 7527.70] P:1510.53 E:0.027249 |  Joe Hart, a lot of shirt swapping going on.
[7527.70 - 7532.70] P:1598.43 E:0.024708 |  Andre Perlow with his long hair, just drenched with sweat,
[7532.70 - 7534.70] P:1327.59 E:0.027840 |  being embraced by the goalkeeper.
[7534.70 - 7537.70] P:1554.57 E:0.025964 |  He's actually wearing a blue vest underneath his blue shirt.
[7537.70 - 7540.70] P:1703.63 E:0.023947 |  And now the England players have just branched off to the right
[7540.70 - 7542.70] P:1408.71 E:0.026657 |  towards their dressing room.
[7542.70 - 7546.70] P:1491.42 E:0.025714 |  England's first defeat in a World Cup finals in the opening game
[7546.70 - 7550.70] P:1510.76 E:0.027020 |  since 1986, and with Costa Rica beating Uruguay earlier on as well,
[7550.70 - 7551.70] P:1113.68 E:0.028046 |  they've now got it all to do.
[7551.70 - 7555.70] P:1554.28 E:0.026551 |  And what a crucial game it's going to be against Uruguay in Sao Paulo.
[7555.70 - 7557.70] P:1539.49 E:0.024229 |  But England are going to have to recover,
[7557.70 - 7560.70] P:1591.15 E:0.024269 |  because physically they're going to be drained from this experience.
[7560.70 - 7563.70] P:1558.36 E:0.025169 |  And after all the optimism and all the confidence going into this game
