 What's going to happen after that is that there will be a minute silence for the victims of the earthquake and the tsunami in Japan. So as the referee and the players pose for a photo, I can just remind you of the team news. There's no Edidier, Drogba or Nicholas and Elka. They are both on the bench. Carlos Tevez is injured, so Edin Jaco starts up front from Manchester City with Mario Balotelli among Roberto Mancini's substitutes. The players make their way to the centre circle. The Chelsea players with arms around each other's shoulders. The same for the Manchester City players in their white shirts. And there will now be a minute silence for the victims of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. 1 min climb IU This is five live from the BBC. Barclays Premier League coverage this afternoon is Chelsea against Manchester City, your commentary team Alan Green, Craig Burley. And first of all this afternoon, my King. And our thoughts continue to be with the folks in Japan. I think it's Craig, I mean, I don't know if you've been out there, but they love their Premier League football in Japan too. They watch absolutely everything over there. I made my debut for Scotland there, Mike and Hiroshima, Hiroshima, whatever you want to pronounce it, made it back way back in 94. So yeah, I've been out there and it's troubled times. Yes, very troubled times. Football and life in perspective, doesn't it? I will remind you of the line-ups after we get underway here, but Chelsea will begin this game playing defending the Matthew Harding stand away to our right. It's an oversimplification, but in many ways looking at this game it comes down almost to a shootout between two players who really have got something to prove. I think Giacomo of Manchester City looking for his first Premier League goal and Fernando Torres as well, still looking to open up his account for Chelsea. But 50 million for Torres is exactly what City played for both Ballotelli and Giacomo. Anyway, here we go with the sides playing it around inside their own half Chelsea. Fabio Cappello here watching John Terry, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole, Joe Hart, Gareth Barry, James Milner and Micah Richards too, I would hope, even though he's in the under-21s. Unlucky not to be in the full squad. Game settling down. City had to change from their light blue. They're playing in white shirts with a red strip and they've won a free kick for a foul by Essian on Giacomo. No tempo at all at the start of this game. Very leisurely and now it's De Jong with the free kick. Played short to Yayaturi, now to Gareth Barry over on the left-hand side. It's just walking pace at the moment. Two Italian coaches here, the two best defensive records in the Premier League. Let's hope we get an early goal from a neutral point of view here just to open things up. Luis now gets his first touch inside the Chelsea half and plays it back with pace to check. Very leisurely start, Craig here. Yeah, very. And we came to the thought where the Calu Torres and the same side that Calu might play Wade and Maluda, Wade and the other. Soman close up to the plane through the middle with the Land of Torres and what looks like a kind of orthodox 4-4-2. So a little bit strange. Well, if you're just joining our commentary, let me tell you that neither Drogba nor Anelka are starting today. Carlo Ancelotti's trying to get the right balance, but he's picking Torres ahead of the other two. So they all have to fit in. Chelsea's line up is Czech Yvanovich, Luis, Terry and Cole. Essian, Ramirez, Lampard, Maluda, Calu and Torres. A rare start for Calu. Can he make the most of it? City with Tevez out with a groin injury and James Milner makes a return to the squad. Balotelli's back on the bench. They have Hart Richards, company Lescott and Kolarov. Lampard going forward, tackled cleanly by De Jong, just broke off there in case referee Chris Foy was going to give a free kick. It's out of play now over on the far side. The rest of the city side then De Jong, Barry, Silva, Tourette, Milner and Gekko. Chris Foy, as I say, is the referee and the ball is back with Joe Hart in the city goal away to our left. Chelsea, of course, made a blistering start to the season, winning all their opening games, scoring loads of goals and then their first defeat was at Manchester City in September when Carlos Tevez on the breakaway got the only goal. So Ancelotti's looking for his first win over Mancini in the Premier League, looking for his first win over City, come to that. And again, the pace is very slow as Hart clears. High one towards this near side of the field, Ashley Cole jumping with James Milner. The ball back inside City's half. Mancini was appealing for something down there. His side have the ball De Jong, rolls it square to Gareth Barry, Barry to Yaetoure and now a good ball, clips down the left-hand side of the field to Kolarov. Faced by his fellow countryman Ivanovic, in comes the ball straight up Pedecek. He was allowed to run an awful long way there, Alexander Kolarov. Ivanovic had topped in and Ramirez, who has played the way that of the players, didn't quite drop back. He doesn't have to fight back. Ivanovic is now coming on a good break for Chelsea, but it's a porous fall in which is volleyed back by Lescott to the half-way line. Craig Burley, former Chelsea man, of course, with us here at Stamper Bridge for one of the showpiece games. Chelsea and Manchester City very much settling down though in the first four minutes. Chelsea now with Maluda onto Torres, doesn't control it first time, Richards gets it away from him and the one thing that Torres at the moment is lacking is that crucial pace. Maybe the injuries have taken their toll on him as now Kolarov clears, big high one towards Jeco. Jeco does well, wins the ball in the air, Silver feeds off it, Silver back again to Jeco. Just inside the Chelsea penalty area, in comes the challenge from Lewis, just does enough to force Jeco out of the penalty area. City retained possession though, Kolarov over on the far side, short pass to Yaetoure. In now to the unmarked Silver, Silver buzzing around as usual here, plays it back again to Yaetoure. Now clipped to the left-hand side to Kolarov, City making a reasonably confident start here. Kolarov takes the ball towards the dead ball line, drags it back, Essien is waiting to clear now inside the Chelsea penalty area. Still some well remeerence, given the ball away and City back in possession again, De Jong to Barry, City getting more of the ball early on here, still building over on that left-hand side. Nigel De Jong now, good Chris, pass to Milner, Milner forward, can't get it past Lewis though, wasn't particularly well laid off by Milner, now Chelsea looking to counter attack here, Ivanovic again, one good run already. Ivanovic, Chou, Kalu made a run and he wanted the ball, he tried to find Torres down the right-hand side, City have it back again and inside the centre circle, Barry nudges it off to Micah Richards. I don't know why Fernando Torres, when David Luiz came forward, why he wants to go and stand out in the right-hand, touch down. I just don't know why he wants to drift so far away. Silver now for City, he has been a good signing to Silver, now De Jong, De Jong, this is good play from City, Milner against Luiz, oh and Milner now onto Yae Atore, Yae Atore shot, Jack turns it away, still in play for Silver, crossing opportunity for the Spaniard and it comes from Silver, riches off balance with the header, Luiz will clear out of the penalty area but De Jong knocks it back in again and City made a decent start here, now it's looking to break now, Lampard onto Maluda, City players getting back now in number, Maluda for Lampard, edge of the centre circle, down the centre now, looking down the left-hand side, Ashley Cole just about keeps it in, oh he doesn't and it's a throw to Manchester City who were really threatening there. Yeah, first save in the match, Peter Cech, a good save down to his right-hand side, the ball from Maastricht from 20 yards from Yae Atore, but again the architect really is the midfield from Mancetti, getting it into David Silver who's playing slightly on the left-hand side but doesn't stay there mate, wants to tuck in, he's very good at finding those little pockets between midfield and defence and once he gets turned Silver in those areas he can pick a pass, much brighter start from the away side. Well it's very much a sort of Shirley Bassey game, this hay-big spenders, both of them are looking at the benches, ignore the goalkeepers, outfield players on the bench, Kachele C, Drogba, Miquel, Basingla, Zierkov, Ferreira and Dnelka and for City, right-Philips, Adam Johnson, Chelsea building, Boateng, Vieira, Boyata and Balotelli. Here come Chelsea now, Maluda, good block though by Campanets, back on inside the centre-circle, Essian has an injury now to Giacomo, Essian's challenge. Yeah, I thought it was a good challenge mate, in all honesty, the ball was just broke free, Essian's gone down for it, he's played the ball, he's trailing leg, his momentum's caught Giacomo, you know, I've always said this, how can you make a challenge at full speed and then stop yourself? And for anybody that says this is momentum that takes them through, it's just absolute nonsense. By the way, on the subject of refereeing, I'd love to ask a referee to try and point out the difference between Jamie Carriga's challenge on Nani and Johnny Evans' challenge yesterday on Holden, one was a yellow card and one was a red, couldn't really see too much difference between either of those challenges. It's Louise Clears, onto the half-way line, back header from Calu and now here goes Fernando Torres, needs support, he's boxed in against Lescott, does well to find Calu, Calu doesn't control it though, Lescott really battling well there for City and now the visitor's trying to break and in goes Ramirez with a clear foul and that's a free kick to Manchester City. I can't answer your question but what I would say is that Jamie Carriga's challenge was probably worse in many ways. So you kind of got along my way, what I'm trying to say is you know, it's a consistency isn't it? Yeah. Unless you have the same referee doing every single game. Anyway, free kick to Manchester City, Nill Nill here at Stamford Bridge and the ball is back with Lescott. The trouble is for Chelsea that with the system to play Calu and Torres up front, does the Solomon Calu doesn't drop back into midfielder quick enough or back a little bit deeper quick enough, Manchester City are getting the extra mile in there and there's been a pop in the ball around. Right, well this game just needs something to ignite it at the moment because if we're not careful this just could carry on for the next 80 minutes or so. This chess match between Angelotti's side and Mancini's side, just jockeying for positions inside the first four minutes, check clears now, flatter one this time. The bounce evades Calu though and it travels through once more to Joe Hart. I wonder what Drogban and Elka must be sitting in that bench thinking. Well, apparently Didier's quite happy with the, he was talking wasn't he? He buys into the rotation if you believe what he was saying in midweek. Well, if he's happy it's time for him to go. Yeah. Simple. But it's all down to Torres now to justify if you like the selection ahead of those two as now Silver escapes, the Lampard's challenge and Silver feeds Kolarov over on the left hand, Barry rather over on the left hand side. Barry against Ivanovic. Ivanovic is effective where every plays in the back four and he stabs that out for a throw in. Now it is Kolarov into the penalty area, travelled an awful long way. Giacomo doesn't control it though and Chelsea at the moment pretty much playing at home on the counter and the ball is with Ashley Cole down below us on the left hand side. Chelsea nils and he knows, good ball by Cole. Here comes Maluda now for Chelsea, across comes a defender and the defender was De Jong managed to get it away from Maluda. The Chelsea move breaks down. Ashley Cole is now going to try and steal it back again from James Milder. Torres intercepts and it's a throw into City near side the right. Yeah, it was a good run from Florian Maluda. Mika Richards just pushed on a little bit so there was a space and a big gap in behind for Ashley Cole. Just to think a ball down the channel but Nigel De Jong being the holding midfielder had spotted it, had tracked the run. Maluda tried to play the early ball in and De Jong blocked it. They did a very good job there actually. Chelsea nil, Manchester City nil. The last Premier League game for a couple of weeks then with the international break that we were talking about. Alan and I were scratching our heads last weekend when the FA Cup games were being played that there were no Premier League games scheduled at all, which seems surprising. There's now City look to Yaya Torre down the left. There's a good run from Silva but Yaya Torre doesn't manage to find him and then he goes down under a challenge from Luis. He hasn't got back on his feet yet. City have the ball. Will they put it out of play? No. Yaya Torre's hobble back on his feet again and Richards for Manchester City feeds it in field to Milner. No away win since Boxing Day remember. Now that includes trips to places like Notts County in Leicester, Birmingham and a defeated Aston Villa. Here goes Torres now for Chelsea down the left hand side. Colou makes a run. Torres pass was a bit heavy though towards Colou. Even the sort of simple and straightforward things at the moment is a lack of conviction and confidence about Torres and it's a goal kick. See I think 18 months ago, 12 months, whatever it is, the time frame, he would have taken that on there and he would have committed a defending, he would have dropped his shoulder and he would have put on that extra bit of pace that after Burnham that he had and he would have gone past somebody. You're absolutely right Mike. He had a pass on to Colou. It was quite a simple one. He had one inside and he's over hit it. He's over hit it by five yards from ten yards away. Dave Woods at Warrington. Let's go to you Dave. Well it's an extraordinary score line here. Warrington 60, Harlequin 6 and we play barely less than 60 minutes. Ten tries for Warrington. They're simply cutting Harlequins apart. Remember Harlequins only be beaten once this season. I think they're going to be beaten today. Warrington 60, Harlequin 6. Sadly, nothing like the same kind of fireworks going on here at Stanford Bridge yet and we really do need someone to get in front here and maybe open up the game as now it's Solomon Colou for Chelsea bustling forward. Torres looking to make a run. Colou running a long way with the ball and he puts it to the right hand side to Ramirez. Ramirez in the air! Tumbled down under a challenge. I think he lost his feet though. He fell over and he's on play. There's no suggestion of a penalty and no appeal for it either. Ramirez probably unused to being in that zone really. He just couldn't believe his luck and tumbled over his own player and sitting escape and now they have the ball on the halfway line. I think the ball dropped at Colou's feet there about the penalty spot with a clear cut opportunity and Ramirez actually bundled into him. Torres has got away from Nigel Dion. Chelsea on the break here. Torres down the centre. Only Colou really ahead of him. Torres is moving towards the left hand side and feeds Flora Maluda. Better from Chelsea. Maluda just edges inside the penalty area. In goes the cross into the side netting. No touch there from Joe Hart so it's going to be a goal kick. Well it's relatively open because Manchester City have started well and they are pushing men forward so there's been the odd four-way forward from Chelsea. Fernando Torres there just running in. That's what I was saying earlier. He should be doing a bit more of. It's interesting whenever he plays it wide might Torres into a position for somebody to cross it. I tend to watch Torres in the box in his movement and he kind of stands and waits for something to happen rather than making a run. Maybe I've just been hyper-critical because of the time he's having at the moment. Well, Craig's already mentioned the attitude from Drogber and Elka. At some point in this game I'm sure we will see them and we will see what kind of response Carlo Ancelotti gets from them. I have to say when I was here for the Manchester United match I thought Drogber came on and really was very professional. Disappointed as he might have been to be left out of that game. He came on and gave it absolutely everything. Remember it's Celtic 1, Rangers 1 in the League Cup final. Earlier Liverpool had a 2-0 when it's Sunderland and now it's Calou once more. Selected ahead of Drogber and Elka. Meludas Ball cut out by company on the half-way line. In goes John Terry. First time we've mentioned him really in the commentary. Good ball, clip to the left-hand side. Calling for it is Torres. The ball is with Calou. Side steps, Milner's challenge and then nothing at the end of it but Ashley Cole will smack it back in again and almost puts that into the top tier behind Johart's goal. But Sanay, a little bit brighter from Chelsea. Yeah, plenty of body sport there. John Terry coming out and winning it. I don't think it was Jaya Ture. I think it was about 50-50. I don't think he fancied it. He was a big set-and-a-half stepped out and that just set them on their way. Really they had Calou drove into the box. It's quite sharp. Calou when he gets into the penalty area. He's got good feet and good balance. The ball broke out 25 yards slightly on the left and Ashley Cole couldn't keep it down. Both sides at times struggling for natural width here. Midfields very strong from both with Barry sitting alongside De Jong. You've got Essie and breaking things up with Ramirez for Chelsea and it's nil nil at Stamford Bridge and we've played nearly 15 minutes of the first half on what is quite a mild late afternoon here. Throw in to Chelsea over on the far side and it's out of play for. We've just got a picture of Didier Dragbara I think. What would he look like? He's wearing a hat. Looking happy as you can be. Kind of star man in Verticomas who's left out just chewing his fingernails out. You could have got a lot of money at the start of this season that we would arrive here on the 20th of March with the Chelsea-Manchester City game. They'd all be fit and neither Dragbara nor Nelka would make it in the starting line-up here today for Chelsea. Colou his role for the most part of his career has been as an impact player. And we're going to take you back to the cricket, the World Cup and Lee James. The West Indies have been rolled out for 188 a dramatic collapse so India have won by 80 runs. It means India and the West Indies are into the quarterfinals and crucially for England it means they'll be playing Sri Lanka in the last eight in Columbo. Thank you very much indeed. They're a decent one day side though I think Sri Lanka. So interesting stuff in the cricket World Cup which really comes alive of course from now on. Let's hope this game will come alive soon as well here at Stamford Bridge. It's Nil Nil between Chelsea and Manchester City and the ball is with City and it's with company just in front of us down this right hand side. Clips the ball into Jekko off the chest to Yayatori. Or if he could have got that through to Silver it would have been interesting for City. Chelsea close them down and now Lampard plays the ball to Torres who goes inside the City hop. Back comes Gareth Barry. Barry against Torres. Torres hasn't got the legs to go forward and it's cleared by Lescott and opens up for Kolarov now over on the City left. We're just hoping this game can move up a couple of gears here now. Yayatori back to Barry and now down the left hand side for Kolarov who looks for the throw and plays it straight at Ramirez and he gets the throw. Just come back to that cricket World Cup. You can't surely get beat off Ireland and then win the World Cup at cricket can you? It can't be allowed that can it? Well it's... I remember Italy losing to the Republic of Ireland in an opening game in the World Cup and almost winning the World Cup getting through to the final losing a penalty shootout. I'm telling you cricket. No, no, I'm just trying to... Ashley Cole now for Chelsea and Ashley Cole again. No, I know, I'm just kidding. I don't know that Terry's had a cricket save but there you go. For Amrula now for Chelsea. Shot is brilliantly charged down by company. Chelsea have another chance maybe. Again it's a bit slow though the pace and City have got everybody back inside their own arc. Teras by the way just in case you're joining us. He's not playing today's. I think he's sitting in the stand. He has a groin problem and now it's Ashley Cole of Chelsea. Again still moving it around the pitch a little pedestrian though. Ball in field now to Michael Ession. Ivanovic is looking interested over on the far side. Now it goes to him. Ivanovic to Luis. Luis hasn't made any big runs forward yet for Chelsea. Ession who'll be playing against England in about 10 days time at Wembley. What would you imagine? Ashley Cole now in field to Maluda. Now we've had a lot of passing from Chelsea. Are they going to get anything on the end of this? Cole in field now to an unmarked Calou shooting opportunity. No, he plays it square to Lampard. Bit tight for Lampard who then sticks it into the crowd. Back to Roddy Versailles at the League Cup final. And even as you come to a spraiser faster having to tip over the top there from a free kick by Young Grid Wildney was a long distance out but he's so confident the teenager that he hit it from a good 40 yards or more with the Celtic goalkeeper tipping it over. And where does that leave us? Well at the moment midway through the second half it's still deadlocked at Celtic 1 Rangers 1. Just stay with us for a moment because Rangers have this corner kick. They're causing problems to Celtic with them throughout this half. Here it comes swiveling away towards the back headed by David Weir. Celtic will allow that to go behind and we may be heading for what Greg Brown predicted. Extra time if not penalties. 1 each. Thank you Roddy. 18 and a half minutes gone. A stamp of bridge in the Premier League. It's 0-0 between Chelsea and Manchester City. And now Ession gets away from difficulty well and now Ramirez slides it down the right hand side and it's Ivanovic on the ball for Chelsea in the area at Maluda and Fernando Torres. Torres of course on his birthday today. 27 today. Is that going to break his run? And it goes now to Frank Lampard. Lampard slots it back to Ashley Cole. Cole feeds it forward now to Maluda. Cole's made a little run. Maluda did he dallyed and the challenge came in from company and Chelsea now 20 yards further back. Now Luis can he go forward for the first time here for Chelsea? He's bringing the ball forward and then he loops it to the left hand side. Dabbed down neatly by Ashley Cole to Maluda. Cross comes in from Maluda. Very deep. Too deep perhaps. Colu will get it. Colu, look you're in a pill for a handball there against Jolien Lescott. Nothing given. Throw in only far side. Well I would have thought it was the assistant's call and I'm just seeing a shot of him and he's just waving his arm saying no, no, no. Now Jolien Lescott's left arms out and his clue whipped it in. It sort of flicked the underneath of his arm. It hardly even moved his shot. Throw into Chelsea too high for Torres. City break. No they don't. Lampard wins it back and then plays a high one which is too high and too far behind Ivanovic. You mentioned that lack of time for Chelsea and certainly on the right hand side where they've got Ramirez. Now one of the weak points of the City defence has been Alexander Kolarov. Not in terms of him not being a good footballer going forward because he is but I think defensively he's been caught out on several occasions. That's why in fact Mancini's put Zabaleta in there on quite a few occasions. But with the likes of Ramirez on the right hand side, I'm not sure how much they're going to gain an advantage out there. Sometimes Kolarov has played on the left hand side of midfield with Zabaleta behind him. Zabaleta is away on compassionate leave at the moment back in South America and now City have a free kick. Gekko's been fouled. Quite a few players in this commentary that I'm not mentioning many. I'm not hardly mentioned Milder in this game so far. City have a free kick. It's a long way away from Czech's goal and lining it up at the moment is the man who really does have a big strike. Kolarov, the player we were just talking about, 21 minutes gone in the first half. Chelsea nil, Manchester City nil. So far, nothing in the heart has really been tested in the City goal. One save from Petyr Czek. And now conversation around the ball involving three players, De Jong, Kolarov and Milder. So free kick to City. Gekko lurks on the edge of the area and it's touched off to Kolarov. It's dreadful. He hit it straight at Frank Lampard. Lampard now looking to stretch City down this near side but wasn't pretty well laid off by Lampard and Milder. Milder got the challenge in. Chelsea have the throw in and now it's Ashley Cole of Chelsea. 21 and a half minutes gone. High one to the far side. Ivanovic always available it seems. Down that right hand side. A little give and go now to Torres. Torres turns, in comes his cross straight at Gareth Barry. Chelsea start again. Ramirez, the hard working Ramirez. Fernando Torres trying to hold off two or three City challenges. Going wide now Torres, pulls the ball in, followed up in the air by Lescott. Problem here, hard got his fist to it. Still inside the City area. Headed out now, Essie and gathers it in and City will clear and Silver on the break over on the far side. Not much on around for him though Silver. Silver takes the ball inside the Chelsea half and then should have found Milder down the right hand side but he didn't and it's quickly thrown up by Czech to Milder and Milder looking for Kalu. In comes a good challenge from Vincent Company. Quick word from Craig Burley. It's the halfway point of the first half. It's Milder then through the half time with Alan Green. Well that's probably one of the best pieces he'd played with seen from Fernando Torres and his short time with Chelsea. They're really well down the right hand side in the box. Skip forward, should have better pace, clip the decent ball in. Nobody could take advantage but up to this point. Alan Johar hasn't the save to make. Well so far the game's having the same effect a couple of Horlicks would have at bedtime. It's anemic sadly. Here's Kalu. Kalu in the centre of the Manchester City half. Onto Ramirez, Ramirez. Unopportunity shoot. Auditlampard flags up for offside. I don't think there's any doubt he was offside. No, no. It just waited. I mean he made... The timing of these runs great. It's the timing of the pass from Ramirez. He's a good yab and a half to offside. So good decision there but they're just gradually getting... finding a little bit more space Chelsea and behind Nigel De Jong and Gareth Barry. Playing as they are Chelsea 4-4-2 Craig, are you surprised that both Anelka and Drogba were left out? Yeah because I think when we saw the teams Alan and... I thought it was going to be 4-3-2. Yeah I thought Kalu in the right and Maluda in the left and I thought that was the only reason why you'd leave one if not both of Anelka and Drogba out but... I don't know. And bearing the mind that Manchester City play, generally we won up in sort of five in midfield. Bit strange. The League Cup final score at Hamden is Celtic 1-Rangers 1 earlier in the Barclays Premier League, Sunderland 0 Liverpool 2. Maluda on the halfway line for the League Champions. Back to Essien. Essien inside his own half. Now inside the centre circle, clicks it away to the far side towards Ivanovic. Back to Luis. Unfortunately so much of Chelsea's football is slow. Terry. On to Maluda. Coles available but it goes in field to Lampard. And Nitro Ramirez back to Lampard. This is a little bit better but then the move breaks down. Good a deception by the acting captain for City Company. And then Silva gives it to Ya Ya Turi. Good work by Ya Ya Turi. Evading Lampard and Silva and Jack O ahead of him. Ya Ya Turi ignores the plays into the right to Milner. Milner on to his left foot. There's the cross. Too high for Jack O. Straight into the hands. The welcoming hands of Penochec. Not sure why he cut back on his left foot there. James Milner could have taken a touch after good work from Ya Ya Turi and just put it in where he's right. Here's Maluda rushing over the halfway line. This is more pace and he's dropped down by Milner. Freaking. And it's a yellow card I think for James Milner. It tackled down in the touch line about two or three minutes ago. I thought it was a very good one actually. On Solomon Clute and timed it well. Chelsea fans didn't think so. That particular occasion he dived in from behind, tried to win the ball, scoop it away from Milner, took Milner first, stopped him when he's tracks. And I think rightly given a yellow card. Well it's over 30 yards some goal but Frank Lampard, the way he's grooving the ball at the moment before he places it on the turf, just might think it's within his range for a shot on goal. Joe Hart said nothing to deal with at all. And now there's Penochec. He's had one save from... Oh sorry there was. Ya Ya Turi. Yeah, yeah. There's a good effort by Ya Ya Turi. And maybe it's going to be Ivanovic. Well it'll be Ivanovic or Lampard. The ball's pretty central. No Ivanovic moves away. Nearly 26 minutes played. Niel Nolant's Stamford Bridge. Lampard with a free kick. Driven low and rebounds off the wall. It was poor. He's Essien in the centre circle from the rebound. Essien waits and tricks it forward to Torres. Torres forced to retreat though and almost lost possession. It gets the pass out to Ramirez. It was a good challenge by Kolarov but Chelsea still have the ball. Luis, Shenmuey is not getting over the halfway line. I liked a bit of Gail that free kick from Frank Lampard. Did you see the one from Charlie Adam yesterday? Yes I did. Fantastic execution. Luis silver the halfway line right at the centre circle. Poor pass forward by him. Cleared by Ji-Yong to Silva. And now Ya Ya Turi. Miller breaks forward and is ignored. The pass goes back. The company into Richards. They swap positions for the moment. For the moment. I think they're going to swap again. Ball back with Lescott. Now left from Barry. Onto the far side in Kolarov. Infield to Nigel de Jong. Edge of the centre circle. He just flicks the pass to the right flank to Miller. Miller's volley pass was behind which is it was poor. The company clear straight onto the chest of Cole. And then well done. Miller taking the ball off the England defender. Miller approaching the Chelsea penalty and runs into the re-established England captain John Terry. And Cole clears it to Maluda. Still Chelsea 0 Manchester City now. Which would please Tottenham I think. And I think Tottenham particularly want either of these two teams to win the game. Here's Ya Ya Turi. Good ball to the left side to Kolarov. Kolarov moving in field. Plays it back to Barry. Into Ya Ya Turi. Ya Ya Turi onto the near side of Micah Richards. Richards now. 25 yards over the half way line to Miller. Richards keeps going forward. Miller looks in field instead to Silva. And Silva plays the ball to the far side of the field. Nobody's going forward quickly. There's some real intensity to the game. So far a disappointment. Here's Jekko. Jekko holds off two challenges. Gets it back to Barry. There's no city player anywhere near the penalty area. Ya Ya Turi trying to find Jekko. Ya Ya Turi actually hit the ball against the winger. Back here's Miller into the penalty. And it was left foot. Good block by Frank Lampard. And it's taken away by Ashley Cole. Well they eventually got there didn't they? It took an eternity Manchester City. Cole to Colou. Good work by companies. Little unfortunate the ball squirted away to Lampard. Excellent pass by Lampard to Ivanovic in the far side of the field. Already midway inside the city half. Very congested though in that midfield. There's no real width at the moment for Chelsea. White to Ramirez. Onto Ivanovic. Ivanovic back to Ramirez. Torres waits. Here's Maluda. Back now to Lampard. Lampard should some long range over 30 yards. And it's high and wide. I just think it's the wrong option. Alan again there. I mean he takes a touch out his feet. No back left. He's trying to score from the best part. 30 yards. Frank Lampard when he had a simple ball out to the left. And he's shuffled it out to ask the Coles to get that little bit. Create a better angle to get the delivery into the box. It just seems to be... Both teams are trying to smash the door down the middle at the moment. Hard for the goal kick from Manchester City. Driven towards the far side. Czeco pushed Ivanovic in the back but got away with it because the ball broke into Chelsea's position. And Luis heads it back to Peter Czeck. Czeck out to the Brazilian defender once more. And he can move forward if he wishes. But he plays the pass sideways to his left to John Terry. Back it goes to Luis. And there's a marked lack of atmosphere around the bridge today as well. It's hard and he knows he's coming from the fans. Luis again. They're hardly going to be jumping up from their seats. What they've seen so far Craig? I mean Chelsea they're just happy to pass it between the two centre backs. Out to the full back. Back to the centre backs. And just man to the city. I'm going to do what they have done a lot of times this season is get men behind the ball and make it difficult. Company. Just smashes the ball over the half way line hopelessly straight through to Peter Czeck. Because of his penalty area to greet the misplaced pass. Forward to Terry. Back to Czeck. 30 minutes gone. That we can mostly forget about. Carlos Tevez is in the stand today. Tevez picked up a groin injury in training. So there are a number of significant players injured as we move into these two international weeks. England playing at Cardiff. Next Saturday the whole game of course you will hear on five line. Chelsea 0 Manchester City 0. And the Barclays Premier League. 14 minutes to go to halftime. Here's Jai Artura. On to Jaco on the far side of the field. Jaco Dunney. City left. Good ball in. Milder. Milder shoots from long range. And it bumbles along the ground and behind for a goal kick. Well I fear it's turning into I'm afraid what we thought at the moment. And that is two teams that are unwilling. And in many ways unable to play the game with a bit of tempo. You've got two sides that have got wide players. If you call them wide players that want to come inside. I mean that was a great example of the shot from Milder there. He was playing like a second striker almost. He was so far tucked in from the right. I think City aren't quite the team they can be when Tevez isn't playing. No. They're missing him today. Devislo man's quite good. Silva. He thought he kept the ball and playing the far side of the field but the assistant flagged otherwise. And it's a throw in to Chelsea. Tickenby Vanovic launched in the direction of Torres. Company responded well. Company spins and knocks it out of play. But they've gained about 15 yards courtesy of that earlier throw in. And the Vanovic is trying to steal some more. In fact he's encouraging him to go further forward still. He's midway inside the City half from the Chelsea right. Vanovic waits to take the throw in and throws it towards Colou. Goes back out of play off Kolarov and courtesy of two throw-ins that I, with a third of them, level with the edge of the City penalty area. Chelsea right. Throw goes to Ramirez. Back to Ivanovic. Ivanovic retreats and then plays it back to the captain John Terry. Fabio Capello in the crowd today. This is reinstated captain Terry back to Luis. Terry on to Essien just ahead of the centre spot. And Essien flicks it towards the left side. Accurately asked to be called. Good control by the England left back. Back to Malouda. Malouda into Torres. Malouda wants more. Long way out. Finds Essien with a pass. Essien misread the run of Colou which was away from the penalty area rather than to it. And it's cleared by Manchester City. Ball back to check. Rodney Versailles. Sorry, the instruction came from the studio at a time when I was mid-colonary. Sorry Rodney. That's all right Alan. It's just like you know nine minutes to go here at Hamden Park. Nine minutes away from Craig Brown's prediction that this one would end in a draw and go to extra time. It's still one each. Rangers have absolutely dominated this second half but it does look as though the Labour's against Eindhoven on Thursday night in the Europa League are beginning to tell. They look as though they're turning. Opportunity perhaps for Celtic is still one each here at Hamden Park. Here's Collough going forward from Manchester City. He was well tackled by Ramirez. We've got 12 minutes to go to half time. 0-0 and that affects the game. It's pretty poor stuff so far. Collou though. Fixed the ball past Covey. Here's an opportunity for Celtic. Collou with Torres to his left. Into Torres in the penalty area. Delayed his shot. Brilliant comeback by Nigel De Jong. He's got a blocking challenge in behind for a corner. Well he was very uncomfortable for Nanda Torres about getting his body in the right place to make the strike here. He was laid down on the left-hand side into the penalty box and just delayed pulling the trigger on the left peg and that just allowed a brilliant, quite brilliant challenge from Nigel De Jong to get back in. Best piece of play by Chelsea and especially Solomon Collou. 11 minutes to half time. Nildale at Stamford Bridge. Beludin to take the corner. Luis is up in the penalty area. So too is Terry. Terry Hettel. Vanovic didn't control the ball and it's cleared by Jekyll. Way to the far side and out of play for a throw-in to Chelsea. Well I think Vanovic actually tries to chest this about eight yards out. It just comes to him a little bit quicker off John Terry there. Couldn't quite adjust his body. Not great marking from Manchester City. Terry was free and Vanovic was free too. The players you would expect that would be noted in the dressing room as to be picked up. Especially, well especially Vanovic. Terry is a threat as well but he has scored a few goals with Vanovic from set pieces. Vanovic wins a throw-in on the far side of the field off Kolarov. It's midway inside the City half. The throw goes towards Torres but it was asking an awful lot of the Spaniard and it's intercepted by Lescott and cleared into the Chelsea half by Manchester City. Luis picks it up. Luis suddenly sprints forward. Gives the ball to Lampard. Lampard on to Kolarov on the inside. Ten minutes to half time. Nil-nil. Colou. Back to Lampard and now John Terry in a quiet Stamford Bridge. Luis to Essie. Essie and now good ball to Torres. Lovely flick by Torres. Into the penalty area. It's played back by Colou towards Lampard. Didn't reach Lampard and then as the ball squirted back on the far side the offside flag was raised. Ramirez offside. Yeah I'm not quite sure after a fantastic flick from Fernando Torres as he had his back to goal. Ball was played into his feet about ten yards outside the box. He's flicked it into Solomon Colou who's picked out. He's tried to be unselfish. He's tried to reverse the ball back to Frank Lampard. It was challenged by Vincent Company. The ball went back to Ramirez who was offside. I'm not quite sure whether that was the right option there. Whether Ramirez might have just pulled the trigger. From the resultant free kick. Hart hits it upfield. Here's David Silva on the far side. The pass was just hit firmly enough to reach Barry. Barry almost lost it. He would get it through to Ya Ya Ture. And then Ya Ya Ture pulls back Torres as he made a challenge and roughly this four nearby awards the free kick. It's the first sign of applause I think we've heard round here. Well there's nothing else to energize the fans. From the free kick. The balls on the near side with Ashley Cole. Go ahead Craig. No it always needs David Louise to step out from the back in one of these masier runs and just... He's got it now actually. Just give the police a lift. Here he is moving over the halfway line in the far side of the field with Chelsea right. If Vanovic Ture is right. Can't get the pass through to Vanovic intercepted by Silva. Little man Silva and Silva runs the ball out of play under pressure from Louise and Vanovic. We're good at Dave Woods. Well there's an extraordinary score line in the rugby league here Ellen. Warrington 82, Harlequin 6 full time. 14 tries Warrington. The biggest ever score for them. 10 different try scorers. 30 points for Brett Hodgson alone with 13 girls in a try. A hat trick for Bridge. Harlequin have won at Leeds and at St Helens this season. They're no mugs but they've impolverized here by a red hot Warrington who are top of the table having won 82 points to 6. Balotelli is amongst the Manchester City substitutes. Limbering up in this near touch slender without sharpening his studs. 8 minutes to half time. Chelsea nail Manchester City nail. Was there any excuse whatsoever for that challenge Craig on Thursday night? Given the situation that City were in? No it was idiotic of the highest order. Stupid. Not only did he let himself and his manager and other teammates down in a game where I thought they couldn't get back into that against Dave. I think there should be a hold of the play here because surely Richards sustained a head injury there. Referee's looking at it but play continued. There was a sort of wild challenge on Milner. Now the referee comes across to see Richards to see if he's okay. Why can't he just hold up play immediately? Yeah it's a left arm from Florian Maluda. There was an accidental collision of heads between Maluda. After his arm had gone up there was a collision of heads between Maluda and Richards. Yeah because I think Richards was fuming that he felt there was an arm from and then four players surrounded James Milner and clad him. I think he felt there was an arm in his face making Richards and he took umbrage to that and went in for the challenge quite aggressively with Maluda and the air and the both sort of clattered heads a little bit. In fact he is getting some treatment. Maluda is going off down the, he's going up into the dressing rooms. Yeah he must have a nosebleed or something like that. Hold on a second. There was an indication there that Chelsea might need a substitution. I think he's got a bad, I think he might have a bad gash. Oh dear. Right six minutes to go to half time. Chelsea, Neil Manchester, Sydney, and the League Cup final in Scotland is 1-1 between the old firm Regis and Celtic and earlier in the Barclays Premier League, Sunderland, Nill, Liverpool, two, Liverpool getting a penalty in the first half which was never a penalty. The defence was committed outside the area should have been a free kick and you know how long would the officials have needed to correct that decision. The first replay would have told them and justice would have been done. I think Liverpool were probably the better side in the game but really not good enough. You know there's at least one major incident every weekend now that such poor decisions could be corrected very quickly. Maloud is alright. He's back on the pitch with a little bit of grease over his, one of his eyebrows, his left eyebrow. Ramiro is on the far side of the field. Does really well the Brazilian. Ramiro is into Essie. Essie and Nye. Dallyed on the ball initially but kept possession. Fines Lampard onto Cole promising from Chelsea. Cole's pass slightly under hit. That gave Richards an opportunity to get in there and make a challenge. His clearance wasn't great though but Cole gives it back to Richards and then his attempted clearance hit a city clerk with Calu inside the penalty here. Calu running forward that's going behind for the goal kick. The company did really well in the end. Showed some great feet in the edge of the box there. Clare just to shuffle it from right to left and create a little bit of space. Wonderful skill but then sort of got bogged down and crowded out a little bit and again company was helped by Nigel De Jong back there doing a good job. I've got to say the game is so slow and it's build up from both teams. Inside the last five minutes of the first half here on Five Live. Nile Nile. And then Fernando Torres has been asked questions about when he's going to score his first goal. I know Jekyll has but has anybody really been convinced by the praise for Ed and Jekyll? No, definitely not. And from the way Torres is playing and not scoring, Liverpool had a really good deal getting 50 million for him. But he will come good Torres. He's too good a striker not to. He's really good at it and the Chelsea left. Pulls the ball in. Calu, three turns, shoot straight in half. Well, you mentioned Torres and in many ways when this ball was picked in from Maluda from the left and Solomon Calu takes control of it. Roundabout the penalty spot, he's got a simple little lay off to Fernando Torres who was 17 yards out, very central and he tried the difficult thing. Long clearance by City. Jekyll doesn't get there. Luis Dals, Luis plays it off Jekyll out for a throw in, level with the edge of his own penalty area. Jekyll came to City at a big price with a great reputation. In German football, I haven't seen anything from him. Really, nothing. He's a big guy. Obviously, opposing central defenders will particularly like that physical challenge. But does he look worth multi millions? How long will City wait to decide? A bit like Balotelli. Excellent tackle by Terry on Milner. Ball breaks now to Maluda. Maluda 25 yards over the half way line, moving in field. He's got Lampard running to his left, but the fastest to his right to Esiand on Turramirez and was that over hit? No, Ivanovic can keep it in play in the far touch line. A garden for the touch line. Crossed early, hit collar off, rebounds Turramirez. Two and a half minutes left in an anemic first half here at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea nailed Manchester City now. Esiand to Terry. Terry in the opposition half on a rare occasion in his first period. Now, back it goes to the half way line to Luis from Ivanovic. You could hear the groans of frustration amongst the Chelsea fans. Not a good ball forward by Esiand. Intercepted by Manchester City. Barry left by Jaya Torey for Silva. And here Jaya Torey. Milner with a bit of room down the right side with the passes under hit by Jaya Torey. He knows it. Ashley Cole intercepts. Rushes over the half way line. Colu to his left. It goes to Colu. Maluda in field. Maluda takes it up. Back to Ashley Cole. Ashley Cole down the Chelsea left. Unhappy with the options in field. Plays it back to the half way line in John Terry. Sort of sums up the first half up. Terry hits a crossfield from left to right to Ivanovic. And now to Maluda. Where's Torres? Torres is he on the side of the penalty area. The pass goes nowhere near him. It goes to Colu. Down the left side. Colu back to Ashley Cole. Torres still waits. Cole now crosses into the penalty area under hit. Headed away by Barry. Here's Colu. One minute left to half time. Or at least until added time. Under hit passed by Colu. Chance for a city counterattack. Milner finds Jekko. I thought Jekko was going to lose it but he did well in the end. Jekko finding Milner again. Back to Jekko. Where's the width down the left side? That's going to be provided by Kolarov. That's a good ball by Jekko. Colu takes it on his chest. Crosses low left. Put it in towards silver. Knocked away by Luis to safety. And out of play goes for a city throw-in. Yeah really. Fizzed that in. Kolarov there. Well defended by Luis. He is Kolarov again. And tries to get a cross in. It hits the defender and it's behind off Ivanovic for a corner. I think this might be the first corner is it Manchester City? Don't recall another one. No I can't recall. So it might be the first time Chelsea had to defend it. It's going to be an out-swinger from Kolarov who has got the ability to fizz it in. Lescott and the dangerous Richards are off inside the Chelsea penalty area. There it goes. In towards Michael Richards. Bray Fetter away by John Terry. I think collided with his own player Ivanovic. They both died. Collision of heads there it appears. And the ball's out of play and we'll have a hold of him play while we make sure that neither of them is seriously injured. Yeah Terry and Colu. Mika Richards was going for the ball. Who is? A big old strong lad. John Terry is taking a knock but he's back on his feet. It was Solomon Colu's forehead at the top of his head that's crashed straight into the face of John Terry. What would Fabio Capello do if Terry's injured this week? Who's captain of England? I think Mike Ingham should get the job. For all that matters Mike can go out there toss a coin and get back up to do the commentary with me. I think is that not how Fabio's been doing it anyway tossing a coin? Does anybody know what is going on in the England coach's head? I would really like to talk about that this week. That's of interest to you on 6-0-6. The lines will be opening in about 10 minutes time. 0-500-9-0-6-9-3. Write it down and then call. We're deep into the one minute of added time. In fact we've had the minute of added time and it was unfortunately a pretty forgettable first half. Yeah I think we've had one decent strike. Memory serves me right from Yahya Tory. I put a check with a good save. Shot was from about 17 yards. The game has been played between penalty boxes in the midfield. It's been slow and ponderous which is really suited man to the city who get bodies behind. On the other case they've looked slightly dangerous especially coming down there left. I think Chelsea have got to have a lot of tempo to the game. There's no real width and the tour is sort of a clue. Partnership safe to say isn't working. We may as well start again. Half time it's 0-0. I'm going to go straight to Hamden to be honest with you. I've got no follow-up questions or anything. Go get a cup of tea or something. Roddy Forsythe. Yes Roddy Forsythe and Craig Brown are going into extra time as Celtic and Rangers are. Mr Brown got the prediction correct. It's the only thing we haven't had in an old film game of course this season. We must say that although Rangers were arguably the points victors have been a boxing match they might just have aged it. Craig what you couldn't say in the last 10 minutes was that they were the dominant team. They were looking at the results of the Europa League tag against PSV Eindhoven in midweek. Yes I think extra time does favour Celtic. They should be fresher. Rangers had the last couple of weeks two very very tough Europa pictures and Celtic was being fresh during that period. So they should be the fresher side. But neither goalkeeper in this match is going to be safe to make it quite unique that they are no longer in the game without any trouble. Very good behaviour on the pitch and off the pitch as far as we can see anyway. They see on the pitch very very well discipline teams. I think they've been warned by the police before the match about the consequences of any misdemeanor. So it's a good sport against counter reasonably good quality of play but very few goalers incident. Let's just go back to what brought us to this stage midway through the first half. A Davis left boot shot. Forster got a hand to it but the on-line goalkeeper from Newcastle didn't get what they call a big hand on it. And it skimmed off his glove. Skimmed also off the post even then didn't go straight into the net. Took a little curl before finally putting Rangers ahead but seven minutes later and easy goer cross a Samaras header behind him. And there was a fine follow up run from midfield to Glantz the ball away from Neil Alexander. There was one each way the tremendous moment of controversy when Ronja tackled Jalević appeared to bring him down. The referee clearly signalled a penalty kick then changed his mind and gave Celtic a free kick and booked Jalević whether for simulation or descent. We have yet to find out there was discussion about whether or not it could have been the Linesman's flag for offside. Understand that's not what happened although there'll have to be some clearing up done afterwards. Anyway the two teams are about to go back to their stations because they've had that couple of minutes break and a chance to take the power drinks and have a few words from the manager in Rangers case Walter Smith the manager in Celtic's case Neil Lennon was up in the stand but we saw him on his walkie-talkie relaying those words of inspiration which we presume they are to his deputy Johann Mialbi and we're about to go in to half an hour of extra time and the reason is of course we haven't had enough of the old film this year. And I'm assuming Roddy that Neil Lennon will be able to use that walkie-talkie if it comes to choosing penalty takers. I would imagine so. I would imagine of course if possible you try to have your penalty takers worked out before the game so that everybody knows where they are and certainly I know that Rangers have done that to the best of their knowledge. Not always entirely possible because of course players can be removed because of injury and of course players can be brought on because of the penalty taking skills and Craig Brown and I are rather fancy that if it's still one each shot even two each for example if it's going towards penalties then Rangers may well try to bring on David Healy for that purpose but we're underway again and no doubt you'll be hearing from us again soon. It's still one each but we're into the extra half hour. Roddy and Craig Brown at Hamden thank you very much so the CIS Insurance Cup final is into extra time at Hamden I'll round up all the rest of the day's sport for you including Kenny Delglish and Steve Bruce after Liverpool's 2-0 win at Sunderland all after Claire McDonald with the latest news. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullin says it's effectively already in place. It's had a pretty significant effect very early in terms of our ability to address his forces to attack his forces on the ground which we did yesterday outside Benghazi and get the no-fly zone stood up. We've taken out their air defense. He also rejected the Libyan health authorities claim that 64 civilians were killed in the airstrikes. All these targets were looked at in terms of actually minimizing collateral damage and the reports I've seen have indicated minimum collateral damage. I haven't seen any reports of civilian casualties. Colonel Gaddafi has given a telephone interview to Libyan state television. He called the airstrikes a new hicklerism and is vowed to defeat them in a long war but the rebel spokesman Mustafa Geriani is confident there won't be one. I don't know what kind of war he's talking about. He committed the awful war, the most criminal acts ever conducted by any dictators in the world he had committed. So we don't really pay much to what he says. Whatever he says it makes no difference to us. We know we don't want them to rule Libya anymore and everybody united on that. Libya is united and Tripoli is going to be our capital. There has been criticism of the airstrikes in Libya from across the world. Both Russia and the head of the Arab League voice in concern about the use of force. Secretary General Amir Musa said the strikes should make sure they protect civilians and not harm them. In other news there are reports, more reports of violence in Syria. Security forces have opened fire on thousands of anti-government demonstrators in the town of Daraa, killing one and wounding a hundred. Japanese officials say they've made two of the six reactors at the Strikken Fukushima nuclear plant safe. They also say they're making gradual progress to gain control over the rest of the facility. And a 90 meter long cargo vessel has run a ground off the Isle of Wight. The policy is thought to be on a shingle bank near the needles. Nine crew are on board trying to pump out water. They hope to be able to refloat it tonight. Travel news now. Let's start in Lancashire on the M55 eastbound. One lane is closed due to an accident and recovery work. That's between junction three, the turn off of Kirkham and junction one, the turn off of Fullwood. The matrix sign there set to 50 miles an hour. And the M6 northbound in Warwickshire, one lane is closed due to an accident. That's between junction one for Rugby and Lutterworth and junction two, the turn off for Coventry. Clare MacDonald, Five Live Travel. This is where driverability counts most. Formula One is back for 2011. A will to well, hard to touch! Lightning quick reactions, sensational stuff. I hope you're enjoying the excitement of the radio because this is Formula One and it's very, very best. The Australian Grand Prix. Live across the BBC. Time to go racing. On BBC TV, online and here. On Five Live. Sunday from 6.30am. This is my chairman with Five Live Sport this Sunday afternoon. Live from Stamford Bridge where it's Chelsea Neal, Manchester City Neal at half time in the Premier League. How has extra time begun at Handham? Well, we're four minutes into it. Rangers, Lucas, they've had a little lease of life but I'm going to pass you over to Craig Brown who with a manager's or coaches or motivators, I spotted a difference between the two teams as they took their break just before extra time started. Craig? Well, we're just saying to Roddy that Walter Smith refused to allow any Rangers player to sit and get any treatment or get a bit of mass size. Half a dozen seconds, Clare's not lying around. And of course, Neal then is up the stand. Hillary was giving that message down, I don't know, but psychologically when you look at the teams at the break there at the end of full time, Rangers look to be the more disciplined, the more eager to continue. Celtic were moping around, sitting getting some drinks and getting massage. And if you look there, you would say Rangers are more up for it than Celtic. And Rangers have just won a free kick just as you've spoken to us and it's within striking distance. Vladimir Weiss was the man who was brought down. So they've got Jelovic and they have Davis here, both of whom might fancy a pot at it. Just stay with us for the moment because this is certainly within distance of giving Fraser Foster a problem if it can be got through the wall or up and over the wall. And there's a discussion between Davis and Jelovic. And I see also Kyle Hutton might just be fancying it. But I rather think this one is going to be Davis is going to take it. Davis has been the outstanding player for Rangers today. He's got the goal and he's been the tireless midfielder and the team that sometimes has looked like a referee just wanting the 10 yards back for the Celtic players. Here comes Davis, he's left it to Jelovic, Jelovic's over the top. Oh, it is almost there. But with Fraser Foster flying the wrong way and I think the ball may have taken a deflection. The goalkeeper made an awkward but effective save. The ball was going to his left as he went to his right. He somehow managed to pull off a save by flicking the ball over the top. It wasn't exactly like the Craig Gordon save that made such headlines in December because he had more sight of the ball. But I tell you what, that was a tremendous save Craig Brown. Wonderful save, great reaction save. The wall was deflected from the head of one of the players on the jumping wall, the Celtic wall. And it redirected the ball but it's a great save by Foster. And but Rangers haven't got the danger clear yet. It's vice but vice in that case just thrundles the ball into the arms of Fraser Foster. And I have to say to you, if this game goes Celtic's way, they'll look back on that moment and think that Fraser Foster certainly would deserve his medal. Over six, almost seven minutes into extra time here at Haddad Park. Six old fan derby of the season and there's nothing to choose between these two sides. Celtic won, Rangers won. Now earlier today, Liverpool 1-2-0 at Sunderland. Luis Suarez getting Liverpool second. He then went on to suffer a groin injury. Kenny Dalglish has been speaking about the Uruguayan and his striped partner Andy Carroll. They're saying for everybody that follows Liverpool Football Club, it's the first time Andy and Luis have played together. So I was very encouraged and signed to you. They're telling me I'm going to be quite fruitful for us and we'll look forward to that. How serious is Suarez, do you think, Kenny? I don't know, I've come off. Well, he came off before me but I've come out of the dressing room into here so we'll let you know if there's a problem. But obviously that puts the slight cloud on it, you know, if he's going to be missing for a little while. Well, as long as he's missing for them in the oasis. It's only two friendlies as well, so OK. We'll just have to wait and see, we don't know. Can I just ask you if, you know, is it right that you have spoken to the owners about maybe carrying on as Liverpool manager into next season? Is that right? What's been said? Well, it's right, I've spoken to the owners. Somebody will tell me what's in the newspapers, they'll probably tell me first. For me, there's nothing to be said, there's nothing being discussed in detail, so there's nothing to report. Are you planning to do that? Is that like on the agenda? I'm planning to finish the press conference and I've got to do another press conference and then if I've got something to tell you, we'll be delighted to tell you but there's nothing to tell you, so if there's nothing to tell you, I cannae make it up. Well, no hands Christian Anderson, I cannae make it up. But the owners, whoever's in here next year will have fantastic owners working here alongside them because they were really supportive in the January transfer window and along with Damien Camoli did a fantastic job getting the two players in, Andy and Louise, and they'll go again in the summer for some players, so the clubs in good hands. So they'll have a happy ending then? Oh, hands Christian Anderson. I've never read it, I don't know. John Murray talking to the ever-entertaining Kenny Dalglish, although he might not be smiling now, Dalglish, because there's been a goal at Hamden, ready for side. Well, he played for Celtic but he grew up a rangers supporter, you know, so maybe he liked it when it was 1-8. Let's put it this way, rangers have scored and it came from a piece of very quick thinking by Vladimir Weiss, the substitute. Now what happened was he was fouled away over on the far side of the field, the referee didn't see it, the assistant referee used his earpiece to let the referee understand that there had been a free kick. The referee stopped play which had gone into the rangers half, indicated the free kick, the ball went back to Weiss, while the Celtic players were arguing, he saw Jelovic beginning to make a run that was going to take him behind the Celtic back to the central defenders, played the ball in for Jelovic, Malgru couldn't catch him, he must have been tempted to bring him down on the edge of the box, instead Foster came out and Jelovic rolled the ball very carefully past him, it came off the left hand post of Foster, rolled out of the goal and then it's Curl took it back in again at the far side on the post despite the fact that Izygwer was trying carefully to scoop it out and frantically to scoop it out and so rangers are in the lead and they took that lead seven minutes into injury time so we're still in the first half of added period here, it's rangers leading by two goals to one. Thank you very much Roddy, back to the Sunderland Liverpool game, Liverpool's first goal was a penalty from Dirk Kaut, however the penalty itself was awarded on the advice of the assistant referee but even Jeremy Carragher afterwards admitted that the foul took place outside the area so let's get the views of Steve Bruce. The disappointment for me is for weeks we've been banging the drum about getting the crowd in, it was a fantastic atmosphere and for me the game for half an hour was anybody's game, both teams were bang at it and then starts the catalogue of what turns into a terrible afternoon where I find it unbelievable that a referee can give the decision and the right decision and he's ten yards away, he's ten yards away from the action, I've just seen it on the monitor, he gives it and there must have been a delay of some thirty seconds then where the linesman then decides and intervenes and says it's a penalty and he's eighty yards away, now and now he's supposed to be looking alongside the ball and he's got the line of it but how can he genuinely make that call from eighty yards away when the referee's ten. If they got the right decision right then you hold your hand up and say to the guy, fantastic you must have eyes like I've never seen before but he's got it wrong and that for me was the turning point in the game. Now we still might have got beat, the catalogue of errors after we made after then but losing two players within five minutes of that incident turned into one of them horrible afternoons for us where we couldn't do anything right but the big talking factor was, was it a penalty and the answer was no. Steve Bruce aftersunderland's two-nil defeat, India beat West Indies at the cricket world cup by eighty runs and that result means that England will play Sri Lanka in the quarterfinals in Colombo next Saturday, the rest of the quarterfinal line-up is Pakistan against the West Indies, Australia versus India which will be a belter and New Zealand against South Africa. Here in Rugby in the end of the cup final, it's a Newcastle seven Gloucester twenty seven that's the latest and in Super League it's Bradford eighteen, Casper fourteen, Warrington eighty two, Harlequin six. During half time the crowd were introduced to a man who had brought his wife here to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary on the basis of the first forty five minutes he'll be lucky if she sticks around for number forty one. Your commentary team for the second half Alan Green, Craig Burley and Mike Kingham. Thank you Mark. I just wanted to make a point before this game restarts about that penalty because we were watching it at Sunderland and it's a hobby horse of mine this and it's a classic example of something we were talking about two weeks ago on the program because they had at least thirty seconds to sort that out and it could have gone to the fourth official, could have been seen on a replay as we were watching in the press room and in all the mayhem that followed on the pitch it could just have the correct decision could have been made anyway. I'm taking the arson vengour on that one. You didn't see it. No. Okay. I was quaffing your buffet in the Chelsea press room but it was just a nice I've got to say. So simple though it could have just been sorted within ten fifteen seconds simple and referees. Accuracy. Official simple. Come on Mike. Long ball forward in the second half. It's by the way, halftime score here into Milan 0 AC Milan 0. Chelsea 0 Manchester City 0. I've just seen a picture of Romano Bramovich who's here today. Apparently he wasn't a fan of some of the football Chelsea played under Mourinho. Nil nil here and it's been very slow and completely different from the last occasion that I witnessed in the stadium between Chelsea and the other Manchester side from United which was a really intense football match. Well let's all get down in the pre-match and hopefully these two sides can sort themselves out and give us a nothing. Everybody in the ground a bit more entertainment than they did in the first forty five which was zilch. Give you the lineups in a moment. Chelsea against this very slow build up. This is the problem with the game. Good ball now from Luis to Lampard. Ashley Coles made a run over on the far side. Ashley Coles holes now. And it goes with his left foot stretching there to try and get on the end of it for Chelsea was Maluda and it's a goal kick. Now here are the lineups. Chelsea check. Mind you these lineups aren't going to stay like this. Certainly Chelsea's. You have to assume drogber and an alcohol come on in the next fifteen or twenty minutes if it stays like this. Check Ivanovich Luis Terry and Cole. Essian Ramirez Lampard Maluda Torres and Calu remember it's Rangers two Celtic one in extra time in the League Cup final Scotland. City's line up is Hart Richards company. Lescott and Kolarov. De Jong and Barry Milner who's on a yellow card. Yeah, yeah. Tour a silver and Jecco. No Carlos Tevez. I think this is maybe part of the problem here in that there's no Tevez who makes things happen for city. There's no drogber and an Elker of course who'd like to get in and make things happen. As we welcome war service to Stanford Bridge. It's a lovely afternoon here. Pretty about the football so far second half just underway and a free kick to Chelsea given by the referee Chris Foy for foul on Fernando Torres. When there's a moment I'll bring in Craig Burley who can just kind of summarize in about five seconds what he's seen so far. And now his foreign Maluda for Chelsea goes around a half-hearted challenge from Barry. Silver tries to close him down. Silver clears straight back to Chelsea. Chelsea made the brightest start and the city crossed the halfway line yet. Jecco is having a poor game is easily dispossessed by Lewis. Then he has a little kick out at the reasons he went forward. City won it back again and Kolarov now the left back is just shoulder charged off by Louise. It's a free kick to city back to Hamden. Well we've reached the halfway point in extra time. The extra period that Craig Brown predicted and of course Rangers leading by two goals to one. Keetja Jalevic scoring after a quick witted thinking by Blandi Mierwijs took a free kick quickly let the creation in. He drew faster. Struck it off the post. The ball came out of the goal area but curled back in and that's the difference between the sides at the moment. So they won Rangers two. Thank you Roddy. Kolarov with Manchester City their first attack of the second half. Big ball in straight at check. Craig? Well you said five seconds to summarise. I'll do it with one. Not a lot. No. It can improve for us now as Ashley Cole goes inside City Territory. The referee does well there. Open his legs. The ball goes through his legs and now Chelsea build over on the left hand side. Again it's slowly delivered to Calou. Calou now to Lampard. Lampard with a nothing sort of dink born into the penalty area. Comes out again. Shot from Calou is deflected and it's a corner to Chelsea and the crowd doing their bit now to try and get behind the home side. Well I don't think there's any doubt we'll see. I think Drogba and Elka. Certainly one of them before the end of this game but I think Chelsea obviously have to get a goal. I think one guy I always think can change a game for Chelsea is Winfrey Zyakov. I think he just adds that little bit of pace to the game. Well the ball is in the quadrant as Chelsea take the corner kick over on the left hand side and City Clear. Back again to... The reason I said that, I watched a few games yesterday and there were so many corners that were illegal ones that were not penalised by the officials. Players just trying to get that extra inch and not even taking the corners from the right places. Frank Lampard now with a nice reverse ball to Essie and over on the left hand side. Not Essie and rather Malouda. Malouda just held up by a company and in comes the challenge and it's a throw to Chelsea over on the far side. We've seen pretty... Not very much so far from City in this second half. Five minutes gone, 0-0. Torres receives from the throw in. Chelsea building again. They're slowly over on the left hand side. Colou slots it back into central midfield now. Essie and for Louise. You can sense he's desperate whenever he can to get forward here for Chelsea. He's not having to do much defending. Now Ivanovich up against Silver. Silver got the challenge in throwing to Chelsea. Chelsea are the light of your team here. They're pressing forward looking to try and unlock City. Remember the two best defences in the Premier League. Now Yaya Torre trying to get away in midfield. Floats the ball to the far side. Milner's full of running. He's all on his own though down that right hand side. No support yet for Milner. Given back to Richards. Richards will play it through the back four now. Company to Lescott and City no great urgency in their play. They'll happily settle for this I think as a final scoreline as Ramirez gets in the way of Kolarov and now Torres picks up possession down the Chelsea right. Only Colou ahead of him. Torres running into the centre. Feeds. Florian Maluda. Now Colou back against the Milner. Straight on the ground. Straight at Chalhot. There's a soft finish in the end from an excellent chance really with Torres picked it up in the right. Drove in. Played a square pass. Ball was laid into Maluda. Penalty spot. Scuffed the attempted side foot on his best foot on his left foot and really got no power in that whatsoever. Easy save for Johar. That should have been hitting me a lot of pace. Chelsea 0, Manchester City 0 on five live and well services. Kolarov's ball in his volleyed away out of the penalty area by Luis only as far as silver. Now Barry and straight back to Luis again who clears. No nonsense. Back to the half wayline. Both of those Italian managers down there. And Chalotti to the left. Mancini to the right. Eight victories each between them in their meetings over the last 10 years. This is their 20th meeting. It's a throw in to Chelsea. Vanovic to take it. Certainly Chelsea the home side playing with a little more adventure. And the throw to be taken by them hurled towards Torres. How much longer will he be given in this game with drug. And the Nelka champion at the bit and also the other player craigs mentioned a few months ago. Jerkoff perhaps might be an option for them. Little bit of wits. Throw to Chelsea. Neat head. No, it wasn't a neater by Calu. It drops to Milner inside the centre circle. Now Gekko, who's really struggled to make an impact in this game. Richards the right back hasn't got forward very much so far to City and he's just been checked by Maluda, but he's got a throw in over on the far side. It's a big call from Ancelotti to go with that pairing up front of Torres and Calu because if it doesn't work. And if the two protagonists come off the bench and it still doesn't work, he's going to be given a lot of questions, isn't he? Torres had tried to do a Muhammad Ali today predicting he would score as income the challenge is now for Chelsea to win the ball. John Terry's gone down again and there's also an injury to Yaya Torres. But the Chelsea team move forward, but it's a pass from Maluda to Calu and now the players are motioning to the referee that certainly John Terry needs help here. Yaya Torres back on his feet again. Yeah, Mika Richards is down as well in the far side. I think Chris Foy was going to pull that back because the injury to John Terry looked quite serious. I'm not quite sure what it is, but he's still down. He looks in a lot of pain, but Chelsea were on the attack, so he was caught between a rock and a half. But if a player is seriously injured, you're going to pull it back apparently. That's the law. He actually makes a challenge on Yaya Torres. He's injured his right knee. I think he's struggling. I think that's bad news. Immediately the cameras close in on Fabio Capello, who of course, I mean, he's just reinstated John Terry as the captain of England. And now he's wondering whether he's even going to have John Terry with him in Cardiff. Back to Hampton. What are you beside? Well, there's a free kick for Rangers in a very important position. It's inside the D and it was a most extraordinary break that brought them to that because they're still leading by two goals to one incidentally and we're now 20 minutes into the period of added time. But Paddy McCourt on as a Celtic substitute fell over the ball while trying to mesmerise two Rangers players. Djelovic was able to bring the ball from the halfway line all the way up to the edge of the penalty area. It was fouled by Magrou. Magrou has been booked for his pains and Rangers now have a free kick inside the D. They're leading by two goals to one that are now nine minutes remaining. The free kick is taken quickly. It comes back off the wall. Rangers still have it, but we still have nine minutes to go. Celtic one Rangers two. Well, the bionic man is back on his feet again. John Terry. He's fine. Frank Lantos just said take a fortnight off John, but he's going to come back on again and he's OK. And where's the ball? Near side the Chelsea right, it's going to be a Levanovic throw and he just throws it back to Joe Hart because the game was stopped so that the players could be treated. So Terry back on again and the throw from Hart now. Where's Richards by the way? Oh, he's back on again as well over on the far side. Just taking some sort of... Oh, De Jong's lost the ball and here comes Fernando Torres for Chelsea. Millenot at Stamford Bridge, on to Lampard. In goes Gareth Barry. Wasn't particularly well delivered though by Fernando Torres. I don't think he's actually playing it for him. I think he's trying to take a touch for himself here. Fernando Torres, he wins it back initially from De Jong. Then he drives in. I think he's trying to take a touch for himself. He's so far in front of him. It goes into Lampard's feet. And then just get the shot of Romana Bramich up in his seat laughing at the end product. What's it going to take to get that pace back again? That crucial extra, that little bit of pace that's missing. I remember the injuries took their toll on Michael Owen, didn't they? In particular. Do you think he's going to rediscover this pace? I don't know, Mike, as the answer. I really, really don't know because you'd have to know if there's any underlying problems with it. He's had a long-term problem. He's growing that affected him at the World Cup. Here come Manchester City now, Silver. Torres is his fellow countryman, Ball in the area, out comes Petticec. I suppose one thing that Torres will have going for him this summer, there's no tournament. So he can at least have a bit of a rest. Now Chelsea bringing the ball out of defence with Michael Ession. Mike, I think Jaya Torres pulled out. He was going through, Czech dead bro to come out. But I thought it was Jaya Torres. I would have smashed into Piotr Cech, there, Ball and Mann. Torres, ball again there to Ashley Cole, was heavy. And it was a straightforward pass really at this level. And he didn't find Ashley Cole. And it's a goal kick to Manchester City. They must be warming up the subs fairly soon, I would think. You're asking me about Fernanda Torres' pace and will it come back? I would have to suggest if it doesn't, it's not exactly 50 million quid wealth spent, is it? That was his game of course essentially, which took him beyond the very best defenders. Chelsea 0-Manch into City 0. John Terry is OK again. Header from Gareth Barry onto Jaya Torres, boxed in between quite a few Chelsea players. Great strength from Jaya Torres. But Chelsea emerge with the ball and it's Maluda now, with Torres on his left. Maluda, drops the ball into Torres. Offside is given though, against Calu it must have been. No, it can't be. It can't be Calu because the ball was nowhere near him, Mike. Well, he could have stood 10 yards offside. He must have given it against Torres. Now City player Long Diagonal to the sneer side and it's Giacomo now on his own inside the Chelsea penalty area. Luis backs off and just then shows too much of the ball. There's Giacomo to Luis, who has his great pace. And the crowd love him here, already at Stanford Bridge as Luis onto SCN and that's got the crowd going. It's De Jong just body checks SCN on the half way line and that's a yellow card for him. Chelsea try and take it quickly but they're not going to be able to because Chris Foy is pulling it back for the booking of Nigel De Jong for a cynical block. He just basically runs in front of Michael Essie. But that's not telling the bigger story. Great defending from David Luiz there, although I've got to say, Ed and Giacomo as they ran into the box, didn't exactly give him a headache, did they? Talking about Nigel De Jong, Pot and Kettle I think this week as well when he was expressing his disappointment with Balotelli's challenge in the Europa League. When you think back to the biggest game of all that he played in against Javier Lonzo in the World Cup final in South Africa. We move on here at Stanford Bridge. Chelsea 0, Manchester City 0 with 13 minutes gone in the second half. No changes yet made by other side as Luis gives the ball away straight to Silver and now Silver hits it straight back to Chelsea. That is the kind of game we've got going on at the moment. Too many mistakes. Chelsea now with Michael Essie. Essie down the centre onto Torres. In comes De Jong. De Jong against Torres, shades of the World Cup final. Out of play for Throw-In to City this time. And there's no question Craig, is there, that if you'd offered Mancini 0-0 before the game, it would have been your hand off, wouldn't it? Yep, I think you'd take that in quite a few games away from home actually. It's a clean sheet and Bill from there, seems to be the mentality. Don't forget the lines open. Are they open now for 6-0-6? Yes, Alan Green here at Stanford Bridge with you straight after the final whistle. To talk all football matters with you on 6-0-6. Maybe some thoughts on the Indian captaincy situation. And now it's a bit of a battle down there with Colou emerging with the ball. Chelsea don't have the wits. Now they try and press down that left-hand side of the field. There's a combination over there of Malouda and Ashley Cole. Early one in from Malouda which is cleared by company. Back come Chelsea once more though. They do seem to be the likelier team if we are going to get a goal here at the moment. They're doing more pressing the home side. Essie and Spal doesn't reach Colou. Changes surely soon for Chelsea. Ramirez now. Skates round a couple of challenges. Cross it goes now to Cole. On to Malouda. Colou and Torres waiting in the penalty area. Ashley Cole pops up on the edge of the area. Very tight though. All the city players apart from Sheco back. Essie and Stryves straight at Lescott. Back again to Essie and Chelsea trying to stay on side. Ramirez now to Ashley Cole and now Malouda. Lots of passing. In goes the chip from Malouda. Ramirez can't reach it in the air. Comes out to Ivanovic and Ivanovic puts it into the stand. Nothing at the end of all of that. Just wiping there. Blood away from his nose. I think Ivanovic is there. He just teed it off himself on the volley. He's just stepped forward from right back. Manches a set. He had loads of bodies back in the box there. They tried on the left-hand side to create an angle but they're not really. Chelsea getting behind the full backs and creating a better angle. They're sort of flicking in the box from deeper areas which is I think a certain company in Jolien Lescott. Remember City have a two-point lead over Chelsea. Chelsea have a game in hand. And that's third and fourth of course with Spurs fifth. Could be important to finish third though you know. What if Tottenham win the Champions League and finish fifth. And the team finishing fourth won't be in the Champions League next season. But that's a long way down the line. Long ball forward now to Torres. Onside in the penalty area. Again the delay in came Lescott. And it's a corner kick to Chelsea. And Frank Lampard comes across to take it. Yeah I mean I think that's him all over at the moment Torres. Although I've got to say the initial run was excellent. Just spun a little diagonal. A little bent a little run down the right-hand channel. Here come the heavy Brigade. Ivanovic, Luis and Terry. Corner kick comes in. Terry tries to claim it. City get ahead to it first. He controls it brilliantly on the edge of the area. Feeds Lampard. Lampard's falling. Header down by Ivanovic. And it's deflected by Sunidic defender. Company for a corner. He heads at Branislava-Vanovic. He heads this from Severnjavs. Straight against Vincent Company's head. That should have been the opening goal. Chelsea threatening to take the lead here. Short corner. Played in deep. My hope too deep for Malouda. And behind for a goal kick to Manchester City. Hanging on a little bit at times here. And Joe Hart. He still hasn't had to make. I'm just trying to think of Sages had to make that great. Well they should have. They should have been making a save there. They should have been picking that out of the back of the neck. Because Frank Lampard stood a beautiful ball up to seven yards out. Hart was stranded on his lane. I'm just looking at another shot of Ivanovic. He won't have any more fingernails left. He headed it straight at Vincent Company. Drogvar and Nelka are warming up at the moment. Long one played high by Jaya Tore Ivanovic with a strong header away for Chelsea. And now Chelsea looking to link in midfield. Ramirez and Essie M. Ramirez improving all the time. A bit like Sandro at Spurs. Ramirez shows too much of that to collar off. And it's going to be a throw in to Chelsea. Chasing the game though. Very much so. Nil-Nil. Remember two-one to Rangers in the League Cup final. Two-nil win for Liverpool at Sunderland. A count penalty and a special go from Suarez from the angle. Now De Jong. Good pass from him to Milner. Milner easily brushed aside though in Chelsea's midfield. Ramirez almost loses that to Milner. But the referee's whistle's gone. And a free kick is given to City. Yeah, Ramirez tugged Milner back there. I don't even think he had to do it because the touch had got away from James Milner. That's why he's given the free kick. Just one thing. In many ways with Torres, Mike, when Chelsea have got it wide into that, especially in the left, Milner's delivery or as they call it the most hasn't really been great, has it? For that quality footballer, it's not been fizzed in. It's quite often they've hit a low one and it's been cleared in the approach. Well, he's another player who's drifted a bit this season after making a really good start. Flora Milner. And it's a city throw in deep inside the Chelsea half, near side, 18.5 minutes gone in the second half. It's Chelsea nil, Manchester City nil at Stamper Bridge. All very different from the fixture a year ago when we had six goals, remember, and City won by four goals to two. Kolarov thrown, gets the ball back again from Barry. Play the ball in field to Milner, but Essien's scrambling well for Chelsea. Chelsea on the break now. Essien with Torres taking up a position down the right, very tight for him, surrounded by white city shirts, has to settle for the throw in front of his manager, who's gesturing that he throws the ball back and he does, to Ivanovic. Terry seems to have happily run off the injury he got about five or six minutes ago. Again, it's this slow build-up from the back, though. Back to Hamden Park. Roddy Versailles. Usually time an extra time and Celtic have had a red card and the reason was from a second consecutive corner kick at the Rangers' end of the field. The Rangers were able to break. Vice was bursting across the halfway line. Isaguir came over and simply took him out of the play. A straight red card. Rangers lead by two goals to one, yet another dismissal in an old-film game. It's been a clean game up to that. Isaguir did what he did for the team, but he's paid the price and Rangers now have 11 men against 10, and they have only to survive one more minute, and they will have taken this six-old-film derby to a victory and a win, which will retain the cup at Ibrox. And as I say, Isaguir ordered off for a straight red card because of that foul blatantly right in front of the tunnel. Thanks, Roddy. We just had another poor cross, by the way, from the Lutas to sort of amplify what Craig Burley was saying a few moments ago. Is Chelsea build again over on the left? Nilnil at Stamper Bridge. Still no changes yet made by either Ancelotti or Mancini as De Jong breaks up the play and gets it away from Lampard. Yayaturi turns the midfield and feeds Silver. City on the break. Silver and Adizheko. Here's his big moment. Zheko edge of the area, and he just delayed, and Luis managed to get the block in. Again, Zheko a bit like Torres, lacking the conviction when it mattered. Well, it was good play. And actually De Jong won it way back in the right back area. He's done a good job today, Nigel De Jong, in that sense. They broke forward. They found Silver in the little pocket, which they haven't been able to do many times in the second half. He set Zheko free, one-on-one, driving about 20 yards out, Mike, with his win over against David Luiz, and he obviously didn't even fancy taking the defender on. Tried to take it early, hit it straight at David Luiz, and then he had a bit of a rush of blood and he's giving a free kick away. And Lescott has gone forward, trying to get on the edge of it. Header on by City, and in the end it was Zheko. And it's gone wide. It's a goal. Kick to Chelsea. We played 21 minutes in the second half. It's 0-0 here, and back to Roddy Versailles of Handeltape. And as you come, the referee, Craig Thompson, blows for full-time, and Rangers have won the Cooperative Insurance Cup, aka the Scottish League Cup, they've retained it, and Neil Lennon's first chance of a trophy as manager has gone. The Celtic in this game were level, they were behind twice, they drew level, when Leidli's header brought them back after Davis had put a shot in off the post, and then it was Jalević in extra time to give Rangers the cup. No doubt you'll be back for the ceremony, but there we are. That's the result at hand, the Celtic won Rangers 2. Thanks a lot, Roddy. We're approaching the halfway point now of the second half, just getting some pictures of both. Could be a double change this. Could be a draw, but Annelka both coming on. Well, let's just wait and see. Logically, maybe Kalu and Torres, or maybe Maluda may come up. We'll wait and see what's on Carlo Ancelotti's mind. So, is that Admitance? Yeah. You can see what he's trying to do with Fernando Torres. He's selecting him. He's trying to give him the confidence. He didn't play him in midweek in Europe when it perhaps he might have had a better chance of scoring against FC Copenhagen here in the Champions League. So, the halfway point of the second half, Drogba and Annelka are about to come into the game, still 0-0, and here's Alan Green. I thought bizarre that Torres didn't start against Copenhagen in the Champions League. This is going to be a yellow card for Ramirez. It is, yeah. So, it's 0-0. The lines are open for 6-0-6. 0-5-1-0-9-6-9-3. Both Drogba and Annelka to enter the fray very soon. After the city free kick, Kolarov, back to Milner. Milner lays it in loads towards the edge of the penalty area. Here's Passback, not good. Silver, Rob to possession. Vanavent, Chelsea in cover attack here. It's with Pallou, running ahead in the centre circle. On towards Torres, the pass is over hit. Didn't do the Spaniard any favours at all. Torres keeps it in play, close to the goal line. Lescott is hustling him, forcing him wide towards the corner fly. Torres waits, hoping for a touch off. Lescott comes eventually and it's going to be a throw into Chelsea. Well, five players had followed there Alan, but just again the ball was over hit. Yeah, Drogba definitely coming on, very shortly. Chelsea on the attack, poor control by Coludo and a counter attack on there from Manchester City. Click to the left by Gekko to Silver. Silver moves in field, he's got Barry available on the overlap. The pass wasn't great, Luis Lecce, David Stanton and Chelsea have it. That was unusually poor from David Silver. It was a bit of a waste, but Barry made a good run actually. Both Annelka and Drogba will come on. Will he be taking Torres off? Will it be Colou and Maluda? Play all three of them? That would be bold. Here's Lampard, 35 yards on to Torres. Torres was fouled truly by Lescott. No, the advantage is played. Chelsea at the ball, there was a foul on Torres. Ramirez down the right side, pulls the cross in, Lescott heads it away. And here's Gekko, Gekko coming to Luis. I don't know why they're throwing the referee. Chelsea a possession. Yeah, maybe they felt that where Torres was fouled it might have been advantages to him. Torres isn't going to play out the remaining 21 minutes, he's replaced by Drogba. He doesn't know it yet, he's walking away. It does know. Six games to go to goal. No, the spurs just ain't working. I wonder who's being replaced by Annelka. I wonder what the odds are in going through the rest of the season with Fernanda Torres not getting off the mark. Well, it's becoming a big question. And people keep quoting examples of Henri and Bergkamp at Arsenal and how long they went without scoring a first goal in North London. The difference is that they were both playing very well for Arsenal at the time. Torres isn't playing well for Chelsea and he certainly won't score today in his 27th birthday. He's off the pitch now. Chelsea nail Manchester City nail, less than 20 minutes to go. Well, good work by Riches on the far side of the field finding Yaya Ture. Yaya Ture with three Chelsea players around him, one of them gets an attack on the last goal. Yaya Ture hobbles away from that, but it will be a throw in to Manchester City. It's just another game though, Alan, where Fernanda Torres goes home. Every day, any day he walks in life and he's not on a particularly good day at the office again. And that's just going to add, no matter what he says, going to add more pressure onto his shoulders and onto his manager. Because he's made that big decision today, Ancelotti. We expected Torres to play, but we didn't expect Torres to play alongside Solomon Caloo. Yaya Ture is being treated at the moment. The coach from Torres basically, I'm not quoting him accurately here, but what he essentially says, I'm not worried about my form as long as the team is doing well. But what's the... You know? Ancelotti doing okay, aren't they? I mean, they're off the pace. Anyway, I mean, the whole Torres thing is subplot to a bigger story and that's Chelsea. And capable at the moment of breaking this manager's set your side down. And if they don't, would you say, what would they be? How many points behind Manchester United? What could I... There'd be 11 points behind Manchester United with just one game in a half. If they don't pick up three points today, I think it's no chance. Good night. God bless. Yaya Ture, I'm sure will come back on, but for the moment, having received treatment, he's off the field of play on the far side of the field. They're taking the time about the throw in Manchester City. No, he's... I think Yaya Ture has had it. There's no clear signal from the physio. Anyway, Richards with a throw. Maybe Ture will come back and see if he can run it off. It's on to Milner, right at the penalty area. Luis comes across and takes the ball off him and then plays it off Milner. In fact, it was a hand ball by James Milner and it's a free kick to Chelsea. Yaya Ture is back on, but he's limping. It'd be interesting to see if he doesn't... He's unable to carry on in the next five minutes. Whether Mancini would bring on somebody like Balotelli or Johnson to play in and around Jekyll or whether he would bring on Patrick Vieira to just try and show it off. It would have meant Mancini's seeming mentality would be Vieira, wouldn't it? But we'll see. Here's Lampard. 17 minutes to go. Nil Nil at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea in Manchester City on five-life. Ivanovic with a cross. Hits the defender collar off. Rebounds to Ramirez and to Essian. Essian towards Lampard at the edge of the penalty area. Lescott hacks the ball away. Brutton to control by Ashley Cole. Left side to Colou. Colou moving infield. Back tie to Essian. A good 35-40 yards from Joe Hart's goal. Still struggling to remember a save that Joe Hart has had to make. Clear by Manchester City. Only to Essian again. Back to Louise. Chelsea Nil, Manchester City Nil. None of the drama nor the goals that we saw in the equivalent game last season. Here's Ivanovic, who perhaps should have scored a goal with a header, but he's been fouled there by Colou and it's a free kick to Chelsea. Yeah, he was pulled by Colou on a diagonal ball across him. He took it down in his chest and Colou just bashed into him. He's given away a soft free kick here. So Ivanovic, who's excellent in the air, is with Louise and Terry, as well as a Nelka and Drugbuck all inside the penalty area. Louise calling on the Chelsea fans and the Matthew Harding stand to get behind the team. Lampard comes forward right for the not a great free kick by Fright Lampard. Easily headed clear. Here's Silva onto Milden near side of the field. They match as the city left. Nil Nel at Stamford Bridge. And now, Kolarov takes it up. Kolarov now approaching the penalty area. Decides not to give the ball to Silva, but it's given to Silva by Yaya. Terry Silva again in the penalty. Kolarov, good challenge by Louise. Running the ball away. Milden takes it off him fairly. Good work by James Milden. I'm impressed by Fabio Capello watching, but the ball set out a play by Barry because Kolarov is down injured inside the Chelsea penalty area. Yeah, I think he just got clattered as he drove into the box and he was taking a knock to the left ankle, left shin, and so they just knocked the ball out. So if Craig were there, if we're saying that a draw for Chelsea would rule them out, the consequences of the draw from Manchester City, they moved to 54 points, 9 points behind Manchester United. Same number of games played, just 8 to go, they're out of it as well. Yeah, I actually don't think they're in it. I don't think they're good. I don't think they believe in it. I think if you look at the team in several games, in most of the games, you think there's a team that can go and grab a game by the scruff of the neck. Great chances, play good football with good players technically. Like you say, Jaya Torey and Silva and Tevez is not playing today and all these guys are better faced with Johnson, but it just seemed to have. The shackles on, Chelsea are going to make a sub here. Jorkov will be coming on, he'll be the final change as play resumes and Chelsea give the ball back to Johar in the penalty area away to our right. 0-599-6-9-3 is the number to call if you want to take part in 6-0-6, which follows the conclusion of this game. Earlier, it finished Rangers 2, Celtic 1 in the Scottish League Cup final and Liverpool won 2-0 away to Sunderland in the Barclays Premier League. That looks like a foul by Barry on the Nelka and Chris Foy responds. It is indeed a free kick to Chelsea. Now this is where the delivery, and you mentioned that last one, Frank Lampard played it, it looks like he's going to play it again. It is not a particularly good cross. Solomon Colloot is about to be taken off. So that's the last throw of the dice by Ancelotti. And basically he's changed three attacking players, Torres, Colou and Maluda, bringing on initially a Nelka and Drogba and now Jorkov. So the free kick is going to be taken by Frank Lampard from a similar position to the last one. He's had better delivery this time, 13 minutes ago, Niel Niel at Stamford Bridge. It's high into the penalty area, headed down by company. Jorkov from the head of clearance inside the penalty area. Back to Louise had come up for the free kick. Louise on the far side of the field, teasing Richards who then fought some free kick. Good work by Louise. I think he just sucked Mika Richards in there and he just reached some fans and footwork and I think Richard had just had enough of that. But that's precisely the reaction that Louise wanted. Yes. Free kick to Chelsea, better than the corner. Six yards in from the corner fly. Didier Drogba's going to take this. No surprise why Drogba, who you'd want in the penalty area, takes free kicks wide. But he will. Boyatou will be coming on shortly from Manchester City. We've got 12 minutes to go. Drogba's free kick and Niel puts it in on by Louise and that might be the way to go for Chelsea. He was absolutely struck free kick. Good header by Louise. It's his second goal for Chelsea and it gives them the lead. Chelsea won matches in City New. Well, it was an excellent flicked header by David Louise but it all comes about because he wins the initial free kick. A stupid challenge really by Mika Richards. Way out in that left hand touch line one. He wasn't going anywhere and that's how you get yourself to the hearts of the Chelsea fans. Lovely ball whipped in by Didier Drogba. The first-time winner is getting picked up by Alexander Kolorov, who's touched tight to him and all he does is just back off on that half a yard and flicks a little ball from the near post back across Johar's left hand side. Harder gets his fingertips to it but it's not enough to stop it going in. An exciting reaction from Roman Abramovich. Could be a big win for Chelsea. Might keep them just about in the hunk to defend their Premier League title. Louise are not content with scoring against Manchester United. That was a vital goal in that game. Perhaps has got the winner. Now there's going to be a double change by Atheist sat down after Manchester City and we're going to find Adam Johnson and Valatelli coming on from Manchester City. Well, unfortunately it's Mancini reacting to go behind, doesn't it? Rather than reacting and doing something when they're at no no. He's having to do it now. He's not reacting rather than proactive. Ball played in towards Jekyll and Louise had a really poor game, Jekyll. Easily headed clear by Chelsea. Here's Johar, what I have to say, why does Johar take free kicks? Because he's very good at them. It was an excellent, he struck free kick. And also that, you know, that is a classic case of not giving away soft and needless free kicks out on the touch line when David Louise was giving a little bit of show pony tricks. And he basically won Wrecked the Dottmeyka Wrecked, he took the beat and he gave away a hail of a soft free kick out there. And that just put his teammates under pressure. It would put them to 54 points Chelsea. That's nine points behind Manchester United, still with a game in hand. So Yahtar Turei, we're not convinced of his fitness since that challenge earlier. He's been replaced by Valatelli. And, well, it's Milner who comes off for Adam Johnson. Well, I think Valatelli certainly won. Who's going to have to make amends for his manager, for his club, for these Manchester City supporters that have travelled here today and those that are at home listening and watching. Well, he's joined Jekyll up front and the throwing goes to Valatelli. His first touch wasn't great, knocked away by Ession. Here's an Elka to Drogba. Drogba tries to give it back to an Elka. De Jong intercepts, then lampards in there, but he can only play at the Colorado. Urgency from Manchester City. Valatelli back to Barry. Silver's in the penalty, so to Jekyll. Valatelli takes the ball. Once more he's tackled, loses the ball. Ramirez onto Drogba. Valatelli hacks it, Drogba. There was a foul there, but the referee played the advantage. Here's Ramirez running powerfully forward and then... Well, I think he's very lucky to get a free kick there. In fact, it's a yellow card. What's that? Who's that? Who got that? I think it's Barry. I think it's Barry, innit? It looked to me as if Barry was about to make a challenge, but it looked in the end. It tripped in the play. He tripped over the football, Ramirez there, and there was no contact. Anyway, it's not the way Chris Boy saw it. Well, considering what followed after I queried why Drogba takes free kicks, I'm not going to query this one. It's on the right for Dade Drogba. 40 yards from goal. There it goes, swinging in right, but it takes an offensive header, almost an own goal behind Czerny for a corner. It's got to be a corner. How is that not a corner? It comes off, Collarov, doesn't it? David Louise goes for it in the back post. The markings off, it comes off, Alexander Collarov. No other touch from a Chelsea player. It goes a yard wide of the right-hand post, and Chris Boy gives a goal kick. Well, his assistant didn't help him. I think even Mancini laughed about one. I was just thinking back to that goal, that David Louise getting picked up by Alexander Collarov, and that last free kick it came in, and Julian Lescott was picking up Nicholas and Elka. Now surely Louise from Set Peacies is a bigger threat than Nicholas and Elka. I'm just thinking about matching your big guys up with your big guys. Collarov for me, I wouldn't associate it with a very good header of the ball. Manchester City have taken just two points from the last four away games in the Barclays Premier League. Behind here at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea leading 1-0, and we've got eight minutes to go. A little less than eight minutes, but we'll have at a time. Remember, the lines are open for 606, 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. The ball is back with Joe Hart. Hart in the D of his penalty area. Hits it right foot at high towards Jekyll. Jekyll jumped well, he jumped first of all into Louise, headed it on, but didn't find Adam Johnson, and here's Essie, just about getting the ball through to Drogba. He used his body strength to hold off Barry. Barry had just been booked, couldn't afford another foul. It went to Zherkoff, back to Ramirez. Ramirez tried to find Drogba, and Lescott is there for Manchester City. Lescott plays it towards Balotelli, headed away by Ivanovich, and then it's hit out of play by Collarov, and it's going to be a throw-in to Chelsea on the half-way line. No, set it now. Balotelli on the left, Johnson on the right. Selva in the pocket behind. What can Huckum have described Jekyll? Kumbosom? No, I'm not going to say what first came into the head. I mean, I just think without garling, City fans, I don't mean to. I just wish they'd shown this sort of urgency earlier in the game. Here's Lampard breaking forward. And the pass, and the call from the penalty, a call shot, brilliantly blocked by Michael Richards. Ball rebounds to Ession. Ession and the call again. Cole looked across into Anilka, cleared by Lescott. Yeah, well defended, Lescott. It was a possible point-saving challenge, and if indeed it won the 0 down, they can get the sell back in the game, because Anilka was locking the edit, would have been a simple tap in had Lescott not read it. By the way, John Cherry appears to be fine now, but he's got his knee earlier. When he went down, when he was on treating him, I honestly thought he had looked like some sort of ligament damage, but fortunately he's been moving quite freely. I think Frank Maywell have just lent into his ear and said, Do you want me to be captain instead of you? That's Captain Evigion, not Chelsea. Here's Ession. Ession onto the far side, and Jerkoff. And Delka and Dropper through the middle, Jerkoff moves forward, into the pen there, great run by Jerkoff, and then he ran into the company, and the company clears the ball. Dropper tried to pull him back there. A company in really well to find Balotelli, who loses it. Anilka takes it up. Anilka shoots from long range, it's always wide of goal. Has it been a great start, Balotelli. Got the poor touches, he's lost it far too easily there to Nick and Elka, and then he didn't sort of bother tracking back. It just shows you with this Manchester City side, and unfortunately, if you're a City fan, without Carlos Tevez, you just lose so much, doesn't it? You cannot rely on the same guy, weekend week out, to do it all the time. Think of all the money spent on Jerkoff and Balotelli. You wouldn't want to depend on them. But here's Jerkoff, he was going to prove me wrong here, edge of the Chelsea penalty area, tried to flick it in towards Balotelli, headed away by Chelsea. Now it's Adam Johnson, the far side of the field. Adam Johnson onto his left foot, moves infield, then he gives it a forward to Richards, right edge of the penalty area. Richards turned into Lampard, Lampard takes the ball off him, and Lampard should clear it. Initially, he gives it a call, that's a good ball by Ashley Cole. To Essian, Essian being hustled by Barry, plays it on, it actually hit to De Jong, and here's Comforti, to De Jong. Less than four minutes left in the 90 minutes here at Stanford Bridge. Looks like a foul tackled by Lampard and Silva, no free kick given, and Essian he's got a squander position, balls out of play for going to Chelsea in the far side. I think, in naming his team, Roberto Mancini, he kind of knew what it was all going to be about today. He was trying to keep a clean sheet, he obviously had it now, and hit Chelsea on the counter, and trying to make a goal, but I think Jerkoff up front, they've lacked any real pace to even attempt to do that. And also by leaving Adam Johnson on the bench, and he's on now. I think it's a statement to say that, you know, we're thinking more defence than attack. Had he been going for it, Johnson would have played from the start for me. Lescott from Manchester City, trailing Chelsea by a goal to Nail, just three minutes to go here at Stanford Bridge. Accompanied, I didn't think he meant to get the pass through to Silva, and they went in, took a reflection of a Chelsea player, but City still have the ball, it's with Barry. Barry now, hitting it high into the penalty, towards Ballotelli, it hit Ballotelli's right shoulder, and not on reason that he didn't control it, and Luis smacked the ball into the crowd in the west stand on the far side. Throw in to Manchester City, Johnson leaves it for riches to take. We haven't seen riches in Caller-off, in attacking positions as we've had, since Chelsea took the lead. The ball goes into the penalty area, headed on by Jerkoff, caught by Jerkoff. Well, I've seen Mika Richards in the last two or three weeks almost play. Mika now, no, when are it teams? Well, it's obviously defensive under instruction. City under Roberto Mancini are not generally an expansive team. He does occasionally let them off the leash, and they're really good to watch, but generally, I don't know, is that what the owners want? Throw in to Chelsea in the far side of the field, and they're looking for minutes from an important 1-0 victory against Manchester City. Aside, they've lost two in the last three occasions. Ession to Drogba, Drogba, Shagnes, then moved into the penalty area, and he shoots off Caller-off into corner. This time, you're just going to have to get it right. They're certainly not sulking, is they? Hammer and Elka, they've almost taken it on board, that's financial, it's a decision. Strangely, it was today to leave both of them out, and go with that collune and Torres' partnership, and certainly has made a difference. Obviously, his delivery for the goal was excellent, Drogba. Here's Drogba with a corner, tap short for Louise, back to Drogba. Drogba on his right foot, plays the ball in towards the near post, it's cleared by Nigel de Jong, and is met by John Terry on the half-way line. Into Ramirez, inside the final minute of the 90, Ramirez passes overhead, Drogba chases after it, and keeps it in play. Well, the cynical might say Drogba's showing all this effort, because he's playing for his last big move. The thing is, you pay 15 million quid for Torres, but think of it as six months ahead, to the start of next season, who's going to be in the starting line? It has to be Torres. Going on form at the moment, it would be Drogba and Elka, wouldn't it? They might not be playing brilliantly. It might be somebody else's decision by that stage, of course. Was that another yellow card? So I missed that. Anyway, it's a free kick to Chelsea. Tapped short by Essien to Drogba. Drogba, aware that time is up, tackled by Silva. Silva does really well. Gets passed, not only Drogba, but Lampard. David Silva onto Jekyll. Jekyll back to Barry. It was a terrible pass from Jekyll, and put out a play by Ramirez. Yeah, there was an early chance for David Silva. Four minutes of time being added on at Stamford Bridge. Yeah, it was a difficult ball on the diagonal to Adam Johnson. It would have been a one-oldy, but he didn't find something clean. I think they've got a free kick here. Yeah, fouled by Ramirez onto Yong. And look at company rushing up. Now, I know he's the acting captain, but I think he's asking for a yellow card for Didier Drogba, because he'd kicked the ball away. Anyway, it's a free kick to Manchester City. Taken by Koro. High into the penalty. Riches with a header, and Jekyll's there. Was he pulled back? Gleskoth there as well. Siston didn't see anything. Neither did the referee. The suggestion there of a tug inside the Chelsea penalty area in Manchester City's favour. Now they cross the ball in again, and Leskoth appeared to be pulled down by Drogba. Yeah, no complaints. They're all patting each other. Little hug from Leskoth there. Nobody's asked for a penalty kick. Just looking at it again on the replay. Well, there's so much pulling. Shirt tugging goes on these days. Corner kicks and free kicks. And from open play in the penalty areas. And most times, it's not punished. He's asked here for Chelsea. Three minutes of added time remain. Great work by Ramirez. Into the penalty area. This should be 2-0. Superb goal by Ramirez. And that finishes off Manchester City. Wonderful from the midfield player, who's shown such an improvement over the last couple of months. Chelsea 2, Manchester City 0. Well, that definitely is a game set in matchup. Indeed, it wasn't. That second goal has just killed it. And Chelsea have deserved it. It's not been a great game. And the right-hander has been showing signs of improving game by game, week by week, Ramirez. He's got a little bit of pace to his game. He's not the strongest, but he's quite correct. Shivels it past 2-3, I've got to say, prophetic. Manchester City attempts at defending. Brilliant run, and he's 4-8 yards out. But at the time, he's 1-1 with Johart. Lovely finish. High to Johart's right-hand side. No chance for the keeper. And Chelsea finally have deserved it. And the man in the face of Carlo Ancelotti, the Lovato-Manchini shakes his head. And I think this is confirmation that City's lone ambitions for the rest of the season, that FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United in April, at Wembley, and a place in the top four of the Premier League and an opportunity to play in the Champions League. Yes, they are now not beyond that. They are battling for exactly the same as what they were battling last year when they lost that final game against Tottenham. And City fans will probably come on 6-0-6 in your programme. But I think they're getting, for what's been spent on this team, I think they're getting whatever happens this season, shot changed with the players on view. I agree, I agree. 0-599-693, if you want to take part in 6-0-6. There's a foul on Jekyll, and a yellow card for Luis. Rather unnecessary. So late in the game, with your team... Well, he's just asking why. He's just asking why. Sorry, it does tend to stay at 10-10 sometimes and try and read things. That's kind of the player he is, but... And the challenge just short of a half-way line. Anyway, Koloss free-kick, high towards, last-lock, great catch, five-check. Actually, old checks had to be cast through the game. It's just an open and off. And obviously, I mean, Balotelli might be capable of idiotic things, but sometimes I think you've got to take that out there. I think you've got to take that out there, Kawaii. Because Ed and Jekyll today, on this performance, hasn't looked like a £2 million player, never mind a £28 million player. Well, as the classic cliche, you need time to settle an English football. Well, the Bundesliga is quite physically quick. Balotelli, well, he just controlled the ball there, and then the ball got past Terry. Balotelli pulled Terry back, tried to make sure he'd get beyond the England captain and just commits a foul and it's a free-kick. And we've had our four minutes of added time. As soon as the free-kick's taken, I don't understand why you have to wait for a free-kick or a corner to be taken before they blow the final whistle, as Chris Boyce just done. The time is up. Yeah, and I think the time might be up for Manchester City in terms of the... I don't think that a quest for the Barclays Premier League, not since about Christmas time. Chelsea, though, that faint hope of catching Manchester United and Liverpool's on it, it is faint. And it wasn't a classic all-in today, and we've gone wherever for it was going to be, and unfortunately it lived up to its expectations. Chelsea did get better in the second half. Torres get taken off for a... again. So that just piles the pressure on him. Droga and Elka on the bench, they came off. Droga was applied to free-kick for David Louisa's flicked header for that first goal. Seti then had to make changes to try and get back in the game. You've heard that story before, and then Ramirez killed it off. Seti never showed enough desire going forward. Jekyll up front for me was just hopeless today, and Chelsea did enough to kick their faint, tapered hopes away. Absolutely right. Chelsea turn Manchester City now. Craig, when Carlos Tevez is in this Manchester City side, whose responsibility is it to set the tempo for them? Well, not Jekyll's, but he had to do more today than what he showed. Now, it's not easy sometimes when a team are playing so deep, but when you've got De Jong and Barry in there, and certainly De Jong, you've got some element of protection. So surely that allows some of the other guys to go and support and get forward. But we didn't see that. He was going to bring Bayata on because he was showing up. Louise got ahead of her, and all of a sudden it was Johnson and the Cat member who else it was. Come on, and Ballatelli, come on. So as we said, he's not proactive, he's reactive. And I think that's a big part. I honestly think, Mark, for the amount of money they've spent, the players they've got, the City fans are getting shot changed. They may disagree, I don't care. I think that's what's happening, honestly. And from what they've got in that squad, they should be doing a lot better. And from a Chelsea perspective, when Drogba and Anelka came on, all of a sudden when Lampard looked up, when Essien looked up, they seemed to have an option, which maybe they didn't have when Torres... It struck me that when Torres was on, when Lampard got the ball and looked up, there wasn't a run being made for him. Yeah, I mean, it's unfortunate for Fernanda Torres. I mean, I don't know the fella, but he is the subject of when's this first goal ever going to go in. But I think the general thing is, his general performances at the moment are not great. There's no getting away from that. And I am not convinced that he's ever going to get back to how he was in the early days at Liverpool. I haven't seen any signs to suggest that. So, in theory, Fernanda Torres shouldn't actually be in the team. But he is. He's been shoe-hard in there for whatever reason, whether it's pressure from Abramovich on Angelotti, or whether the coach actually wants to play him. I don't know. I don't know. But at the end of the day, I don't think any questions will be asked, because Chelsea have won the game. Had they not, then I think they'd have been getting some pressing questions down in that press room after. Yeah, the fans are on those. Very happy Craig Burley. Thanks very much for this afternoon. Let's quickly round up.
