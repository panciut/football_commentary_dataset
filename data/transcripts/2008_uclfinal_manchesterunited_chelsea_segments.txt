[8.88 - 15.20] P:1988.29 E:0.038668 |  badges of Manchester United and Chelsea are unfailed in the centre stage in the

[131.20 - 136.28] P:1905.46 E:0.038254 |  final is it this arguably is the greatest club game we've ever covered on

[147.44 - 154.72] P:1836.98 E:0.036667 |  if there is just a little point to what might happen the two previous occasions
[154.72 - 160.08] P:1908.77 E:0.041069 |  in 2000 and 2003 when we could change from the same nation competing in the
[160.08 - 165.84] P:1756.81 E:0.042982 |  final Real Madrid against Valencia in 2000 AC Milan against Juventus in 2003
[165.88 - 171.44] P:1793.55 E:0.042804 |  that one was at Old Trafford each time it was the team finishing lower in the
[171.44 - 178.36] P:1813.45 E:0.035918 |  league that won the Champions League so is that an omen for Chelsea the anthem
[178.36 - 184.12] P:1835.98 E:0.036349 |  that marvelous anthem concludes the players will be nervous they can't wait
[184.12 - 188.64] P:1734.87 E:0.038275 |  to get on with it we've had that silly opening ceremony which is purely for the
[188.64 - 192.48] P:1518.47 E:0.034954 |  benefit of television and means absolutely nothing to the fans inside
[192.52 - 198.44] P:1670.74 E:0.036431 |  the ground but towards ever thus the two two lineups first of all Manchester United
[198.44 - 204.36] P:1497.86 E:0.035373 |  the goalkeeper is van der Zijk then the defenders Brian Ferdinand Vittic and
[204.36 - 212.64] P:1471.30 E:0.035537 |  Everett in midfield Hargreaves Skolls Carrick then Ronaldo Rune and Tevez not
[212.64 - 216.40] P:1412.09 E:0.043363 |  quite sure what order that's got to form in midfield and attack but we'll know
[216.40 - 222.32] P:1408.65 E:0.038595 |  pretty soon after they kick off Chelsea's lineup and formation is very
[222.32 - 228.88] P:1527.98 E:0.039654 |  familiar goalkeeper is Czech defense Esián Carvalho Terry and Cole
[228.88 - 234.08] P:1549.49 E:0.042019 |  McAleley holding in midfield with Balak and Lampard pushing forward then Cole
[234.08 - 239.60] P:1524.30 E:0.039500 |  and Maluda in the wide positions and Drogba through the middle Esián at
[239.60 - 243.92] P:1506.57 E:0.040698 |  right back Graham Taylor I think it was always going to be is it ever since he's
[243.96 - 247.96] P:1320.31 E:0.042618 |  been moved back there to make sure you can accommodate both Balak and Lampard
[247.96 - 254.04] P:1421.16 E:0.040917 |  I think it was always on I think like many people we would prefer to see him in
[254.04 - 258.44] P:1514.87 E:0.037633 |  midfield because that's where he's powerfully comes on but I can well
[258.44 - 263.24] P:1677.38 E:0.042360 |  understand him leaving the team as it is because he is capable of still coming
[263.24 - 268.84] P:1634.27 E:0.040079 |  forward from that right back position the referee no favorite of Chelsea's
[268.88 - 275.04] P:1673.08 E:0.039273 |  Liverswick Hill from Slovakia according to Jose Mourinho he awarded a ghost
[275.04 - 280.96] P:1553.27 E:0.033008 |  goal at Anfield in that famous champions league semi-final meeting
[280.96 - 285.80] P:1630.51 E:0.041060 |  between Liverpool and Chelsea Garcia officially scored it Chelsea remain
[285.80 - 291.00] P:1572.90 E:0.038556 |  convinced to this day that the ball never crossed the line Chelsea's players not
[291.00 - 295.36] P:1581.76 E:0.037653 |  quite in the huddle but they're all embracing at the moment Manchester
[295.40 - 300.24] P:1599.71 E:0.040520 |  United's Ronaldo is wandering amongst his colleagues shaking hands Michael
[300.24 - 304.88] P:1565.16 E:0.038489 |  Carrick's doing exactly the same thing it looks as if United in the red shirts
[304.88 - 311.28] P:1573.63 E:0.037837 |  white shorts and white socks will kick off this 2008 Champions League final
[311.28 - 317.12] P:1418.84 E:0.038772 |  ridiculously kicking off of course at a quarter to 11 in the evening in Moscow
[317.12 - 322.52] P:1597.60 E:0.039495 |  so it will finish officially on the Thursday Chelsea all in blue the
[322.56 - 327.96] P:1635.61 E:0.034316 |  referee takes the signals from his two linesman and the scenery blows the
[327.96 - 331.96] P:1658.03 E:0.045030 |  whistle the synodos clouds will feel better we're underway and immediately
[331.96 - 336.12] P:1703.08 E:0.043870 |  all hard games is playing down the right side of the midfield in fact the ball
[336.12 - 340.16] P:1622.04 E:0.035885 |  is played towards hard greaves it goes beyond them and behind for a goal kick
[340.16 - 344.24] P:1539.90 E:0.038903 |  now that was the official lineup that you eat the game out in their pre-match
[344.24 - 348.20] P:1596.33 E:0.042575 |  information but it's not always reliable but that's where he is straight away
[348.24 - 352.16] P:1528.29 E:0.042391 |  he's come out onto that right flank and you therefore say both Rudi and
[352.16 - 356.48] P:1614.19 E:0.043055 |  Tevis now are playing as two forwards and Manchester United are playing a 4-4
[356.48 - 361.60] P:1468.74 E:0.041353 |  two-match formation with Ronaldo on the left hand side which puts Ronaldo up
[361.60 - 365.12] P:1635.98 E:0.036742 |  against Essie and of course goal kick taken by Czech here's Lampard
[365.12 - 368.88] P:1441.46 E:0.037820 |  hooking it on to Drogba back towards Lampard but didn't get the pass right
[368.88 - 373.48] P:1405.98 E:0.034004 |  hard greaves picked it up then he was tackle and the balls out of play in
[373.48 - 376.56] P:1472.10 E:0.038372 |  fact it's gone behind for a goal kick I thought initially they'd gone out for a
[376.60 - 379.88] P:1451.37 E:0.040188 |  throw in that no it'll give an early touch for van de Zij
[379.88 - 384.12] P:1534.34 E:0.048265 |  well it all shows what you know what we all know we're all talking about we
[384.12 - 388.44] P:1458.65 E:0.042523 |  can't see that midfield being anything but the three of them in there we
[388.44 - 392.20] P:1496.78 E:0.044050 |  didn't think that hard greaves would come and play in a wide position but that
[392.20 - 395.80] P:1526.61 E:0.043713 |  is exactly what has happened he's well capable of doing that hard greaves here
[395.80 - 399.76] P:1558.11 E:0.039798 |  is hard greaves heading the goal kick on collected by Rooney Rooney miscontrols
[399.76 - 404.04] P:1441.65 E:0.036950 |  the ball it's taken off him by John Terry and then snap forward by Balak
[404.08 - 408.24] P:1517.56 E:0.035516 |  Drogba does well playing it to the left hand side and here's Maluda over the
[408.24 - 412.60] P:1645.91 E:0.041778 |  halfway line into the United half tackled and beaten by hard greaves and
[412.60 - 416.76] P:1815.15 E:0.036588 |  Maluda was tugging at the England players shirt so he could see the freekick to
[416.76 - 423.00] P:1569.54 E:0.032414 |  Manchester United straightforward decision for the referee there and the
[423.00 - 427.60] P:1599.94 E:0.039649 |  freekick taken by Ferdinand here's Paul Scholes Scholes to Evera on the far
[427.60 - 431.84] P:1568.49 E:0.040555 |  side of the field on that or another and Ronaldo is brought down by Essie
[432.20 - 437.80] P:1586.21 E:0.037026 |  now that was a meaty challenge by the Ghanaian freekick awarded of course
[437.80 - 444.32] P:1629.30 E:0.034334 |  Scholes takes it to Ronaldo again back to Scholes Ronaldo collects 15 yards over
[444.32 - 448.28] P:1473.02 E:0.040703 |  the halfway line a couple of fancy stepovers then he lays it on towards
[448.28 - 453.36] P:1655.35 E:0.037958 |  Evera Evera got past the marker and good tackle there given from Joe Cole putting
[453.36 - 459.24] P:1747.28 E:0.039511 |  it out for a throw it yeah lively start I mean although the game has only been
[459.28 - 462.84] P:1505.23 E:0.044403 |  playing a couple of minutes or so Manchester United look really up for
[462.84 - 466.48] P:1508.40 E:0.043672 |  it and they're moving the ball about well Manchester United attacking the end
[466.48 - 471.84] P:1457.59 E:0.037940 |  to our right in the first half that's the end behind which the Chelsea fans are
[471.84 - 475.28] P:1526.89 E:0.038283 |  they don't make best use of that throwing Drogba winning the ball in the
[475.28 - 480.52] P:1582.02 E:0.033632 |  air than he was far I think by Vidditch yes it's a freekicks a few scruffy
[480.52 - 483.92] P:1413.72 E:0.043631 |  freekicks awarded by the referee who's undoubtedly one of the best in Europe
[483.92 - 487.88] P:1487.27 E:0.041222 |  very good I think Alan is one of the points Vidditch will have to decide
[487.92 - 492.24] P:1582.26 E:0.040246 |  should he go in and challenge for that ball on Drogba or sometimes just let him
[492.24 - 496.72] P:1633.38 E:0.042402 |  have it here's Drogba playing it on towards Joe Cole it's knocked away to
[496.72 - 500.60] P:1697.10 E:0.037719 |  safety by Vidditch and here's where's Brian the right fullback from Manchester
[500.60 - 504.28] P:1585.70 E:0.038638 |  United champions of the Premier League in England yet again second success of
[504.28 - 509.60] P:1628.85 E:0.037580 |  season Brian on towards Hargreaves Hargreaves definitely filed as Nicole
[509.60 - 514.80] P:1647.27 E:0.034313 |  just barged into the England colleague and it's a freekick to Chelsea hasn't
[514.96 - 519.76] P:1581.69 E:0.045509 |  done yet at all no it just needs to but as I say Manchester United really look up
[519.76 - 524.44] P:1708.14 E:0.040441 |  for the game as well and coming out with his 4-4-2 formation you know it gives
[524.44 - 528.44] P:1740.58 E:0.041653 |  them that feeling let's be very positive about things there certainly aren't empty
[528.44 - 532.24] P:1692.72 E:0.041425 |  seats in this Mickey a rating particularly at the Chelsea and there was
[532.24 - 536.08] P:1652.04 E:0.036726 |  one Chelsea charter flight that was cancelled and 200 fans with tickets
[536.08 - 541.16] P:1588.71 E:0.039082 |  never got anywhere near Russia but their teams on the attack now lampart onto
[541.20 - 545.04] P:1636.04 E:0.039259 |  Maluda left of the United penalty gets a good cross in headed away well by
[545.04 - 549.24] P:1648.62 E:0.036658 |  Vidditch further clear by Carrick then Maluda picks it up again on to his left
[549.24 - 553.92] P:1700.36 E:0.034382 |  foot lower cross this time bounces towards Ferdinand and he hooks it high
[553.92 - 558.48] P:1563.96 E:0.036354 |  and out and out it comes off Maluda's head is it right for throwing no it's not
[558.48 - 562.60] P:1641.64 E:0.033299 |  he's Hargreaves from Manchester United to Carrick. Carrick hits it in the half
[562.60 - 566.16] P:1645.63 E:0.037004 |  way line Terry intercepts launches the ball forward straight through to Van
[566.16 - 570.44] P:1649.85 E:0.038797 |  Dazaar. There's a good cross by Maluda earlier there from a standing position
[570.72 - 575.60] P:1569.12 E:0.042524 |  he was able to whip it in fortunately for Manchester United I think it was
[575.60 - 580.12] P:1629.73 E:0.041551 |  further than what he's had to it. You're listening to BBC radio Manchester United
[580.12 - 586.36] P:1656.08 E:0.034242 |  0 Chelsea 0 Sculls leaves it for the captain tonight of United real
[586.36 - 590.60] P:1479.23 E:0.038853 |  Ferdinand gigs is amongst those on the bench and I'm told that United would
[590.60 - 595.24] P:1622.81 E:0.035577 |  lift the trophy and gigs is on at the end of the game then gigs and Ferdinand
[595.28 - 602.24] P:1589.22 E:0.032312 |  will both lift it. Chelsea will wish to deny them that that honour Sculls drives
[602.24 - 605.84] P:1507.91 E:0.041805 |  the ball towards the left side taking on the chest by Ronaldo but he can't
[605.84 - 610.16] P:1669.82 E:0.038853 |  keep it in play and it's a throw in to Chelsea. Just little things like that
[610.16 - 614.52] P:1571.91 E:0.038706 |  don't you don't often see Paul Sculls get that kind of long raking diagonal
[614.52 - 619.44] P:1426.01 E:0.038795 |  pass wrong slightly over hit it there. Very bitty in the opening five minutes of
[619.44 - 624.84] P:1538.03 E:0.039684 |  the game. Another nephron and goal so far Chelsea waste the throw in Vidditch
[625.44 - 629.80] P:1680.27 E:0.037397 |  slaps it back to van der Zarr. Drogba recently comes towards the Dutchman
[629.80 - 634.28] P:1575.93 E:0.038114 |  so van der Zarr carries the clearance to the left side and Vidditch again Vidditch
[634.28 - 639.80] P:1453.09 E:0.035016 |  used to play in the stadium for Sportac Moscow. Vidditch hits it over hits the
[639.80 - 644.20] P:1575.92 E:0.035604 |  ball and it scurries behind for a goalkeeper to Chelsea and I'm just noticing
[644.20 - 650.12] P:1455.01 E:0.036148 |  what a lurid orange a goalkeeping outfit Peter Checkers dot on. The bright
[650.12 - 655.08] P:1380.01 E:0.042863 |  orange there is no missing him at all. Now we'll spot him. We'll spot him.
[657.08 - 662.12] P:1532.11 E:0.039243 |  There were five in his play. Nell Nill, Manchester United and Chelsea contesting
[662.12 - 666.20] P:1563.09 E:0.036504 |  the first ever All-English Champions League final. Here's Michael Ailey
[666.20 - 669.80] P:1543.88 E:0.040974 |  hitting the ball towards Ashley Cole intercepted by Hargreaves he started
[669.80 - 673.28] P:1654.22 E:0.034672 |  brightly for the champions of England. Hargreaves crosses the ball takes the
[673.28 - 677.64] P:1730.68 E:0.036441 |  reflection and check momentarily I thought lost his footing there but did
[677.64 - 680.84] P:1731.35 E:0.040692 |  enough to get back and catch the cross. Yeah as Hargreaves looked to put his
[680.84 - 684.84] P:1545.90 E:0.036625 |  cross in it came off Ashley Cole and deflected towards the corner of the
[684.84 - 689.56] P:1325.56 E:0.041623 |  Chelsea goal and just a little bit of a heartbeat there when Peter Check just
[689.56 - 694.04] P:1530.41 E:0.033872 |  slipped but eventually collected it quite comfortably. It's probably too
[694.04 - 699.00] P:1502.40 E:0.040070 |  early to see how this pitch is holding up Graham. I mean it looks okay we are far
[699.00 - 704.08] P:1363.48 E:0.036884 |  distance away but I know that the English Grimesman who was responsible for
[704.12 - 708.36] P:1369.94 E:0.038600 |  laying it wasn't happy with the outcome. I think he's had quite a few problems
[708.36 - 712.44] P:1371.91 E:0.046728 |  really getting them to follow what he thought. He wants to do it's not his fault
[712.44 - 715.96] P:1496.89 E:0.038650 |  it's getting getting the authorities to let him do what he wanted. Here's Balak
[715.96 - 719.52] P:1488.58 E:0.030815 |  a hardy in the game at the moment but getting the ball to Lampard who
[719.52 - 722.88] P:1599.52 E:0.040336 |  exchanges passes with Michael Ailey. Lampard then looking for Drogba who'd
[722.88 - 726.28] P:1563.94 E:0.032194 |  pulled away from Ferdinand but Ferdinand gets his head to that cross and
[726.28 - 730.00] P:1579.24 E:0.037954 |  clears it then Malouda snaps it back into ward Drogba flags up for offside.
[731.00 - 734.88] P:1634.94 E:0.039718 |  Drogba in an offside position there initially wasn't going to get involved
[734.88 - 739.40] P:1533.77 E:0.040593 |  when he chose to do so flag goes up straight away. Nearly seven minutes gone
[739.40 - 745.64] P:1420.66 E:0.041785 |  and relatively uneventful minutes here in the Luzhniky Stadium in Moscow. A reminder
[745.64 - 753.28] P:1442.11 E:0.035215 |  of the time which is eight minutes to eleven in the evening. Here's Scoles to
[753.28 - 757.04] P:1301.14 E:0.040929 |  Brian on the half way line hard by the right touch line on to Tevez. I think
[757.08 - 761.72] P:1427.15 E:0.032562 |  that was Tevez first time. Back to Brian. Ferdinand again. I know Graham Taylor is
[761.72 - 765.56] P:1425.91 E:0.037821 |  expecting great things of Carlos Tevez tonight. Rooney good header to Tevez.
[765.56 - 769.68] P:1647.46 E:0.033015 |  Tevez sort of inside right channel back to Scoles. Scoles not a carrot in the
[769.68 - 774.88] P:1532.86 E:0.038255 |  centre circle. Ronaldo drops deep picks up the pass. Ronaldo turns a one-two with
[774.88 - 779.20] P:1610.79 E:0.041025 |  Rooney. Ronaldo again good play heading the pass to the right side. Here's Hargreaves
[779.20 - 784.64] P:1588.96 E:0.036784 |  whips the cross in. Oh good important vital intercepting header by Terry. Rooney
[784.68 - 788.24] P:1623.55 E:0.039782 |  was ready to direct that cross into the net with his head. Excellent cross from
[788.24 - 791.76] P:1615.98 E:0.046225 |  Hargreaves. We know he can do that when he was playing it right back. Quite right
[791.76 - 796.36] P:1650.79 E:0.035920 |  jump Terry got a vital header there. Here's Hargreaves again and Hargreaves
[796.36 - 802.96] P:1734.53 E:0.034753 |  wins the throw in off Ashley Cole. Ash I didn't see videotape of the incident but
[802.96 - 808.00] P:1547.83 E:0.037647 |  I gather the McAleley challenge on Cole in training last night was not clever.
[808.00 - 814.04] P:1415.92 E:0.038646 |  There must have been a slight doubt about Ashley Cole but he's here starting and
[814.08 - 817.72] P:1416.89 E:0.040837 |  throwing for United taken by Brian to Tevez. Tevez can't get it back to Brian.
[817.72 - 822.32] P:1468.03 E:0.038304 |  It's clicked on by Ashley Cole. Maluda doesn't give it a play and it's yet
[822.32 - 826.92] P:1592.84 E:0.038252 |  another Manchester United throw it. The game not yet settled down. No it's a real
[826.92 - 831.76] P:1446.29 E:0.036472 |  rhythm but I still think Manchester United are ready. Here's Hargreaves from
[831.76 - 835.72] P:1329.41 E:0.037747 |  the throwing by Brian. Hargreaves now cutting in field towards the fennelge.
[835.72 - 839.48] P:1349.76 E:0.037557 |  This time crosses left footed high towards Ronaldo. Ronaldo must have half
[839.60 - 844.88] P:1614.20 E:0.036339 |  thought of a left foot volley and then distracted by his lack of proper thinking
[844.88 - 847.84] P:1377.54 E:0.037946 |  couldn't control the ball and it's behind for another goal kick. You don't
[847.84 - 853.52] P:1466.06 E:0.045324 |  often see that a long raking cross from Owen Hargreaves into Ronaldo who
[853.52 - 857.72] P:1320.65 E:0.044839 |  completely missed the ball railing. It ran out for a goal kick. Very rare you see
[857.72 - 861.64] P:1188.35 E:0.043522 |  miscontrol from Ronaldo. A drug will want something. I've just a drink of water.
[862.60 - 870.28] P:1344.60 E:0.041181 |  Can't be dehydrated. A swig and he'll feel a lot better. I don't think television
[870.28 - 873.36] P:1342.55 E:0.047414 |  audiences around the world will be in throw about what they've seen in the
[873.36 - 877.12] P:1371.11 E:0.043907 |  first five minutes. It's been a little dull and scrappy. Here's
[877.12 - 880.92] P:1513.54 E:0.039174 |  Drogba playing the ball to the left side but ahead of Maluda and the ball didn't
[880.92 - 885.68] P:1602.29 E:0.041110 |  run truly there. It was bumping along the surface. Brian got across with the
[885.68 - 890.44] P:1578.61 E:0.033418 |  interception and puts it out for a throw in which Ashley Cole will take.
[891.40 - 895.32] P:1631.21 E:0.041349 |  Ten yards in the corner flag of the United half. Chelsea left. Throw goes to
[895.32 - 901.48] P:1571.53 E:0.033162 |  Lampard and Lampard's pass intended from Maluda. Hit Karak and Ricochet's off his
[901.48 - 908.12] P:1677.81 E:0.038568 |  knee out of play. I'm told that Drogba actually cut his tongue in a collision
[908.12 - 915.24] P:1653.89 E:0.030598 |  with Vittic. That's why I needed a swig of water. Macalailing. No, it's to
[915.24 - 919.92] P:1723.04 E:0.037601 |  Esi. Where Esi had popped up from right back in central midfield there. Lampard
[919.92 - 924.60] P:1696.76 E:0.043728 |  for a pass from him behind Ashley Cole and straight out of play. He just got caught
[924.60 - 928.48] P:1753.69 E:0.037678 |  there as Ashley Cole came up on. He needed to pass it first time. Once that
[928.48 - 933.00] P:1512.37 E:0.030875 |  didn't happen, stuttering on the ball didn't get his pass accurate. Ten minutes
[933.00 - 938.68] P:1358.27 E:0.036372 |  played and we haven't had an effort on goal yet. Nothing even remotely near.
[938.68 - 944.76] P:1414.94 E:0.044481 |  What's the referee unhappy with? Oh I think he's telling hard reads and
[944.80 - 949.08] P:1656.04 E:0.036612 |  Ashley Cole not to pull each other's shirts. You change shirts at the end of
[949.08 - 953.40] P:1450.16 E:0.036786 |  the game, lads. Brown with a throw headed back by Ashley Cole and then down by
[953.40 - 956.72] P:1488.26 E:0.036122 |  Karak. Skulls fix it on the direction of Rooney intercepted there by
[956.72 - 963.24] P:1577.05 E:0.033991 |  Macalailing. Macalailing's pass forward. Met only by Karak and now here's hard
[963.24 - 967.48] P:1543.58 E:0.036680 |  reads again. To Tevers. Lovely layoff by the Argentine to Karak. Karak was
[967.48 - 971.76] P:1655.01 E:0.038327 |  stretching though and here's Drogba. Drogba almost got passed Birdland.
[971.80 - 975.20] P:1626.06 E:0.037280 |  Birdland did really well to get the tackle in and it's ruining for
[975.20 - 979.40] P:1579.70 E:0.034021 |  Manchester United. Inside the Chelsea half. Tevers back to Karak. White to the
[979.40 - 984.40] P:1674.36 E:0.037381 |  left side and Ronaldo. Ever, sprints forward. Ronaldo takes that as a cue to
[984.40 - 989.36] P:1653.18 E:0.032014 |  run in field. Then he needs the pass short for Skulls. Skulls back to Karak.
[989.36 - 994.20] P:1774.37 E:0.035766 |  A careful thoughtful play by Manchester United. Karak good pass to the right side
[994.20 - 997.20] P:1873.13 E:0.038424 |  in Brown. 11 minutes gone in Moscow. Nail, nail.
[997.24 - 1001.96] P:1678.57 E:0.040150 |  Brines cross left but it headed away by Hardree's and I think Ronaldo wanted that
[1001.96 - 1005.56] P:1597.30 E:0.032196 |  ball taken under control from his chest and it's behind for a goal.
[1005.56 - 1009.64] P:1451.14 E:0.041888 |  It's been misunderstanding but interesting Alan. The two people in the middle of
[1009.64 - 1014.76] P:1338.04 E:0.042945 |  the goal almost in the D were Ronaldo from the left hand side and Hardree's
[1014.76 - 1018.04] P:1439.10 E:0.041736 |  from the right. Now that's when Manchester United are playing at the best.
[1018.04 - 1021.40] P:1370.12 E:0.039927 |  It's not only when they have the movement to the ball, it's when they have the
[1021.40 - 1025.24] P:1399.37 E:0.041586 |  interchange of positions as well. They're the thoughts of Graham Taylor from
[1025.28 - 1027.68] P:1454.75 E:0.038106 |  England. Manchester stand. Colin was just a couple of seats from the left.
[1027.68 - 1031.84] P:1559.26 E:0.038209 |  I'll bring him in in a moment. But here's Balak to Maluda. A few yards outside
[1031.84 - 1035.88] P:1617.30 E:0.038463 |  the United penalty and the cross was too deep. Well beyond Joe Cole who slipped
[1035.88 - 1039.16] P:1735.97 E:0.037565 |  anyway. Stan, what are your thoughts? Yeah, I mean, free match. We wondered what
[1039.16 - 1043.20] P:1545.41 E:0.039446 |  scenario that United were in terms of their personal on the pitch.
[1043.20 - 1046.28] P:1520.62 E:0.045301 |  Owen Hargreaves actually loved the fact that he's down that right hand side even
[1046.28 - 1050.60] P:1507.12 E:0.036425 |  when he's played as a deep midfield player for England and for Manchester United.
[1050.60 - 1053.80] P:1344.01 E:0.039599 |  He's popped up down the right sometimes and put crosses in so that's a real
[1053.84 - 1057.84] P:1645.42 E:0.035918 |  positive step for Manchester United. Chelsea just can't get the ball up to
[1057.84 - 1060.88] P:1455.13 E:0.041939 |  Drucker at the moment. He's not holding it up. He's trying to play things off one
[1060.88 - 1064.60] P:1527.27 E:0.037958 |  touch. So at the moment, although it's scrappy, Alan, I think that United will be
[1064.60 - 1069.40] P:1272.13 E:0.033213 |  happier. And I know Hargreaves, of course, doesn't usually play this role for
[1069.40 - 1074.28] P:1415.22 E:0.033741 |  England. He shows when he plays wide right from Manchester United, he can do
[1074.28 - 1078.00] P:1685.10 E:0.042178 |  just as well as Beckham, frankly. Well, he certainly gets forward and what he does
[1078.00 - 1082.72] P:1704.88 E:0.040009 |  do when he crosses, he puts pace on the cross. So if he gets it accurately, all
[1082.76 - 1086.16] P:1385.53 E:0.039423 |  that the attacker has got to do is get on the end of it. The pace is already on
[1086.16 - 1090.96] P:1478.00 E:0.039554 |  the ball. He's hoping to throw in here at least force, Ashley Cole to continue
[1090.96 - 1094.88] P:1443.53 E:0.041391 |  to throw in, which is taken by Brian to Hargreaves, who's tackled by Michael
[1094.88 - 1099.56] P:1404.98 E:0.037496 |  Leili. And here's Lampoff onto Drogba. Drogba are flicking it to the left side,
[1099.56 - 1103.16] P:1448.78 E:0.035258 |  but got the direction wrong and it runs harmlessly. The bit of two players
[1103.16 - 1108.56] P:1363.58 E:0.038123 |  are back, the Vandezard. One of these cameras on wires above the playing
[1108.60 - 1114.40] P:1500.55 E:0.038878 |  surface. It looks almost very dodgy to me. It's very heavy, probably isn't. But
[1114.40 - 1118.00] P:1584.91 E:0.042543 |  you wonder, A, if a player's going to smack the ball up, he's going to hit
[1118.00 - 1122.32] P:1625.96 E:0.037704 |  that camera, or B, it might slip its murns and crash down into somebody's head.
[1122.32 - 1125.92] P:1495.05 E:0.042097 |  I'd seen it early and there's no doubt about it. It certainly is lower than
[1125.92 - 1130.68] P:1682.22 E:0.033658 |  the usual one. It is. That is certainly reachable for a long clearance. And the
[1130.68 - 1134.56] P:1407.72 E:0.033568 |  game isn't good. There's no other way of putting it, is it? It's not good at the
[1134.56 - 1137.84] P:1349.47 E:0.045117 |  moment. I think the thing is that neither side has what we call controlled
[1137.88 - 1142.08] P:1369.42 E:0.038933 |  possession of the ball for a period of time. I think that Manchester United
[1142.08 - 1145.68] P:1213.37 E:0.041970 |  have been the better team. I think that they have been more lively, they've been
[1145.68 - 1150.08] P:1362.46 E:0.041820 |  more progressive, they've been more positive. But then again, to be able to
[1150.08 - 1154.76] P:1227.11 E:0.042193 |  control the ball, keep it off the opposition and have what we say is good
[1154.76 - 1158.68] P:1365.86 E:0.041171 |  control possession of the ball. Neither team has yet been able to do that.
[1158.68 - 1161.36] P:1543.96 E:0.042941 |  Well, actually Cole can't be happy with the state of the pitch because he's just
[1161.36 - 1165.16] P:1540.50 E:0.036446 |  changing his boots. Here's Ruhney chasing on the far side of the field.
[1165.64 - 1169.08] P:1603.54 E:0.041865 |  Cavaliere, the old nemesis, knocks it away out of play for a throw-in.
[1169.08 - 1172.60] P:1627.40 E:0.036330 |  Cole's boots are okay. He's back on the pitch, but Manchester United on the
[1172.60 - 1177.40] P:1521.00 E:0.032256 |  attack. Another couple of steps over from Ronaldo. Then a simpler fast back to
[1177.40 - 1182.76] P:1729.26 E:0.034373 |  Scholes. On it goes to Carrick. Carrick in to Hargreaves. He popped up from the
[1182.76 - 1187.24] P:1664.06 E:0.036041 |  right flank in a central attacking role, but the passing move from United
[1187.24 - 1191.64] P:1636.61 E:0.033351 |  Breaks down and he is lamp-fired to the far side in Essie. Essie just curls it
[1191.64 - 1195.96] P:1720.96 E:0.035743 |  down that right flank towards Joe Cole across Cambridge and puts it out for a
[1195.96 - 1200.72] P:1433.39 E:0.035303 |  throw-in. You need a quarter of an hour played, not a header at goal, not a
[1200.72 - 1206.24] P:1319.49 E:0.033965 |  shot on goal, nothing threatening either goalkeeper. Here's Balak who's been very,
[1206.24 - 1212.92] P:1398.75 E:0.031066 |  very quiet so far. Passing it back to Terry. Ashley Cole to Maluda. Ashley
[1212.92 - 1215.96] P:1373.84 E:0.042630 |  Cole again. That's a good ball into Balak. A little bit of room now for the
[1215.96 - 1220.36] P:1525.98 E:0.037015 |  German captain. He suits the ball forward but too far ahead of Joe Cole and it's
[1220.40 - 1224.60] P:1555.77 E:0.039867 |  behind for another goal kick. That's a typical example really. When you have
[1224.60 - 1228.52] P:1435.23 E:0.042515 |  wide players where Joe Cole is and people say they've not been in the game
[1228.52 - 1233.08] P:1455.97 E:0.041898 |  enough, they need service. If they're not getting a service, they can't get into
[1233.08 - 1236.96] P:1380.89 E:0.038610 |  the game unless they go looking and wandering for it. In the present time
[1236.96 - 1241.44] P:1366.17 E:0.043781 |  we've not seen much of a movement by the Chelsea team. There's not a lot in it, but
[1241.44 - 1245.04] P:1457.50 E:0.038444 |  I think Manchester United made the brighter start. Definitely. The first
[1245.04 - 1247.88] P:1461.64 E:0.040117 |  quarter of an hour. Still Manchester United and ill. Chelsea and ill.
[1248.32 - 1252.36] P:1542.81 E:0.038537 |  Champions League coverage of BBC Radio. Drogba rushes forward. Biric was there
[1252.36 - 1256.68] P:1518.68 E:0.034685 |  first. Passes back to van Dizar and the Dutchman clears it over the half way
[1256.68 - 1260.20] P:1547.91 E:0.036957 |  line where Terry beats Hargreaves in the air. But his header runs straight to
[1260.20 - 1264.16] P:1623.36 E:0.036380 |  Paul Scholes and here's Evra. Ronaldo's running down the left flank. Evra tried
[1264.16 - 1268.04] P:1615.41 E:0.038614 |  to pick him out. Great pass. Great control by Ronaldo. Left over the edge of the
[1268.04 - 1272.20] P:1710.84 E:0.039499 |  Chelsea penalty. Beats Essien all too easily and then the cross is very deep.
[1272.20 - 1276.28] P:1646.22 E:0.036523 |  Hargreaves jump, couldn't reach it and I think it's going to go out of play just
[1276.68 - 1281.00] P:1761.34 E:0.040429 |  throwing Chelsea. I think if anything some excellent play by Ronaldo. We've all
[1281.00 - 1285.64] P:1645.70 E:0.039442 |  become used to it. But I think if anything Hargreaves got in too early. If he'd
[1285.64 - 1289.88] P:1412.38 E:0.040575 |  held himself out that little bit and been able to run and attack with our post
[1289.88 - 1294.28] P:1415.50 E:0.039886 |  he possibly would have got on the end of the cross. Ashley Cole with the throw in.
[1294.28 - 1298.76] P:1315.91 E:0.036885 |  Ended Balak. Balak didn't bring the ball under control. Ferdinand clears it into the
[1298.76 - 1302.60] P:1438.45 E:0.035557 |  Chelsea half and then it's headed out of play by Brian for a Chelsea throw in.
[1303.56 - 1308.36] P:1319.80 E:0.041493 |  Well, no need to make any notes yet. I mean Hargreaves playing in the right, that's about it.
[1308.36 - 1312.36] P:1509.91 E:0.036928 |  Stan? Yeah, I think it's quite clever tactically for man United because obviously
[1312.36 - 1317.32] P:1469.41 E:0.043523 |  Owen Hargreaves and Cristiano Ronaldo with Witt are actually stopping Ashley Cole
[1317.32 - 1321.80] P:1469.87 E:0.036897 |  and Mike Lessian. Two of their better attacking wide players from getting beyond
[1321.80 - 1327.56] P:1287.44 E:0.044449 |  the half way line. So pretty much it's Gidea Drogba and one midfield player in
[1327.56 - 1331.00] P:1464.64 E:0.040415 |  the United half. So that's where United are getting all their possession from.
[1331.08 - 1334.76] P:1509.00 E:0.039575 |  Don't think Chelsea have started yet. Here's Ronaldo again on the far side of the field.
[1334.76 - 1338.68] P:1558.67 E:0.044109 |  I said it before the game. His first finnuments might be interesting and he started very
[1338.68 - 1342.60] P:1671.93 E:0.038498 |  brightly with the Portuguese. Fines Everett with the pass. His cross. Ended Rune near
[1342.60 - 1345.48] P:1698.43 E:0.037683 |  post. Terry with the powerful header out of play for the throw in.
[1345.48 - 1350.20] P:1646.48 E:0.039048 |  A good clearance by John Terry. Straight under the ball. Well headed, clear.
[1350.20 - 1353.24] P:1674.48 E:0.035742 |  Manchester United's tempo is very good. Went in possession.
[1354.04 - 1357.88] P:1657.24 E:0.039795 |  You know, oh, there's a mistake. Oh, there must have been a foul there. Free kick to
[1357.96 - 1363.00] P:1711.45 E:0.040532 |  Chelsea. Essie was fouled and what's going on here with Skoles and McAleely.
[1363.88 - 1367.00] P:1666.51 E:0.039665 |  Well, now they must have known that the referee had blown his whistle.
[1369.32 - 1372.60] P:1566.15 E:0.042651 |  I think the referee is going to talk to both McAleely and Skoles.
[1373.56 - 1375.72] P:1459.91 E:0.043792 |  Rune was involved in the earlier incident.
[1377.48 - 1383.00] P:1398.29 E:0.039138 |  But it's a free kick to Chelsea. And a pat on the back from the referee for Wayne Rune.
[1383.00 - 1386.60] P:1411.55 E:0.042638 |  So he couldn't have thought it was any serious evil intent.
[1388.36 - 1391.32] P:1483.87 E:0.036447 |  Where did you get that out, Peter? Check.
[1392.68 - 1395.72] P:1457.08 E:0.044628 |  You don't wear that too often, if you're going to say, well, I'll whistle at you.
[1395.72 - 1399.80] P:1430.26 E:0.042919 |  I'm not going to say. I'm not going to say I agree with this.
[1399.80 - 1404.04] P:1377.71 E:0.040922 |  But from a psychological point of view, there is the feeling when you get a big,
[1404.04 - 1409.08] P:1457.38 E:0.039435 |  bright colour, the instinct is to hit it at it. It picks in your mind.
[1409.08 - 1413.64] P:1303.54 E:0.039257 |  And I'm not saying that I believe that to be true or not, but that is the feeling
[1413.72 - 1418.36] P:1559.50 E:0.037665 |  of some people that if you see something bright, there's an instinct you hit at it.
[1418.36 - 1421.56] P:1375.06 E:0.049691 |  Or now there you are. There's one for you. Or you might just throw up.
[1422.20 - 1424.04] P:1278.70 E:0.040703 |  Well, there's always that possibility.
[1424.04 - 1431.16] P:1568.70 E:0.034925 |  Brown looking for Hargreaves. Hargreaves right side gets in and early cross it quite deliberately
[1431.16 - 1436.12] P:1632.38 E:0.042132 |  by Hargreaves. Hit a Chelsea defender. It was Terry and it loops behind for a corner.
[1438.36 - 1440.76] P:1502.50 E:0.050238 |  Hargreaves and Ronaldo started really well on both players.
[1440.76 - 1441.80] P:1580.89 E:0.038638 |  Yeah, they definitely have.
[1442.20 - 1446.76] P:1650.97 E:0.037170 |  Nearly 19 minutes played in the first half here in Moscow.
[1447.96 - 1453.88] P:1598.94 E:0.036701 |  Manchester United Nail, Chelsea Nail. Needlessly a second ball was thrown onto the pitch.
[1453.88 - 1458.28] P:1567.41 E:0.040576 |  Hargreaves retrieves it, flows it away to safety and he will take the corner.
[1459.56 - 1462.44] P:1653.64 E:0.041162 |  Linesman just checking the balls correctly placed in the quadrant.
[1463.32 - 1468.12] P:1592.48 E:0.036512 |  Tevez quiet so far, come short, but he's ignored. Hargreaves whips the cross
[1468.12 - 1472.28] P:1538.16 E:0.033482 |  towards the far post. Well, Droggba went to meet it, missed it completely
[1472.28 - 1474.76] P:1399.76 E:0.037209 |  and it's going to, maybe it was deliberate from Droggba actually.
[1475.80 - 1477.96] P:1275.59 E:0.041724 |  It's very hard to, yeah, very hard to.
[1477.96 - 1481.96] P:1577.34 E:0.035492 |  No, actually it must have glanced off his head because it's the Manchester United throw.
[1482.60 - 1485.40] P:1627.46 E:0.045293 |  And now there's a fire on Ronaldo and the far side of the field.
[1486.20 - 1491.16] P:1660.31 E:0.040089 |  And that was Droggba or was it McAleigh? It's a long way off.
[1492.36 - 1494.28] P:1762.64 E:0.037520 |  Ronaldo has started brightly.
[1494.28 - 1497.24] P:1673.51 E:0.040444 |  Yeah, I mean when I think back to the game at Stamford Bridge,
[1497.24 - 1500.44] P:1599.00 E:0.040241 |  which Chelsea won 2-1, it's a completely different start.
[1500.44 - 1501.88] P:1585.12 E:0.040175 |  Chelsea haven't started at all.
[1501.88 - 1502.60] P:1291.54 E:0.038237 |  Not at all.
[1502.60 - 1507.40] P:1418.13 E:0.036454 |  In that game, they took the game to Manchester United and took early control of it.
[1507.40 - 1511.24] P:1444.68 E:0.038215 |  But at the present time, Manchester United have certainly started as the brighter team.
[1511.88 - 1517.40] P:1563.40 E:0.036924 |  20 minutes played here in Moscow. The free kick is very wide.
[1518.04 - 1521.48] P:1573.58 E:0.036457 |  Ronaldo's going to take it. Oh no, he's not taking it actually.
[1521.48 - 1525.48] P:1475.50 E:0.042545 |  Ronaldo's gone into the penalty area and it's Hargreaves who will whip this in.
[1526.12 - 1528.04] P:1505.10 E:0.041619 |  From the United left flight.
[1528.04 - 1533.24] P:1563.99 E:0.038210 |  Played in towards the near post, headed away comfortably by Frank Blampart and here's McAleigh.
[1533.24 - 1537.64] P:1699.00 E:0.040130 |  Heading it on, clattered into by Paul Scholes. That was a bad ball by Scholes.
[1539.24 - 1540.20] P:1482.25 E:0.057917 |  Hello, oh hell yeah.
[1540.20 - 1545.00] P:1739.38 E:0.042113 |  And now Rooney's coaching a Chelsea player away, Ashley Colton. There was no need for that either.
[1545.96 - 1549.40] P:1607.21 E:0.039298 |  When we talked about discipline, the Mark Saggers before the game,
[1549.40 - 1553.48] P:1503.18 E:0.037344 |  we were talking about Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney and from nothing,
[1554.12 - 1555.40] P:1601.74 E:0.040354 |  you know, we had these incidents.
[1556.12 - 1558.60] P:1522.22 E:0.044688 |  All of a sudden, all of the players together again.
[1558.60 - 1563.80] P:1700.26 E:0.046040 |  But Rooney, if he's been picked up there by either the linesman or not,
[1563.80 - 1566.60] P:1826.97 E:0.042412 |  he could be in trouble because he's certainly come in with both hands
[1567.16 - 1569.00] P:1824.44 E:0.045940 |  and pushed a Chelsea player well away.
[1569.00 - 1572.84] P:1762.39 E:0.042630 |  But he's 22 years of age, Wayne Rooney, and really he should have wised up by now.
[1572.84 - 1579.72] P:1600.82 E:0.032823 |  He and Drogba, he and Drogba are exchanging pleasantries or something like that.
[1579.72 - 1584.84] P:1674.39 E:0.040516 |  Scholes seems to have a cut, but it was surely a foul by Paul Scholes.
[1585.72 - 1590.76] P:1559.44 E:0.037692 |  McAleigh is being spoken to by the referee. There's a yellow card out.
[1592.36 - 1592.84] P:1290.94 E:0.035100 |  But it may be.
[1592.84 - 1595.24] P:1656.40 E:0.049060 |  He really adjudged that McAleigh was the guilty party.
[1596.84 - 1598.68] P:1536.45 E:0.047092 |  I don't see it that way at all.
[1599.64 - 1601.48] P:1569.82 E:0.043352 |  There's a yellow card being waved.
[1601.48 - 1602.92] P:1686.75 E:0.034688 |  I think it is to Paul Scholes.
[1602.92 - 1603.48] P:1572.96 E:0.050044 |  To Scholes.
[1603.48 - 1604.12] P:1780.67 E:0.015183 |  Yes, yes.
[1604.12 - 1609.00] P:1562.56 E:0.038930 |  Well, he's got a bleeding nose, but frankly, it was a bad, bad challenge by him.
[1609.00 - 1611.72] P:1581.65 E:0.039320 |  I think it was an actually it was an elbow that caught Paul Scholes.
[1611.72 - 1613.88] P:1575.20 E:0.040910 |  At first, he thought it might have been a clash of heads,
[1613.88 - 1617.24] P:1517.20 E:0.039730 |  but I think Claude McAleigh was leading with his elbow and his court,
[1617.24 - 1618.04] P:1650.16 E:0.040029 |  Port Scholes there.
[1618.04 - 1621.16] P:1665.17 E:0.037109 |  It's a good spot from the referee if he did manage to see that.
[1621.16 - 1623.80] P:1501.67 E:0.043571 |  But I thought it was 6-0-1 and half, it doesn't have another to be fair.
[1624.68 - 1627.80] P:1610.60 E:0.036593 |  Well, Sir Alex is out along with Carlos Quiro.
[1627.80 - 1629.96] P:1531.03 E:0.033938 |  Sir Alex talking to the fourth official.
[1629.96 - 1633.56] P:1504.25 E:0.044489 |  I'm not certain whether McAleigh was not sure at all.
[1634.68 - 1636.36] P:1507.25 E:0.042908 |  But he certainly had his yellow card.
[1636.36 - 1637.96] P:1388.42 E:0.042888 |  I'm not too certain whether he got a call.
[1639.16 - 1641.32] P:1550.89 E:0.045816 |  Well, it's the first incident of note really in the game.
[1641.32 - 1644.60] P:1586.34 E:0.036533 |  That and the cross from Ronaldo a few minutes ago.
[1644.60 - 1646.92] P:1454.94 E:0.029110 |  There ain't a lot else happening.
[1646.92 - 1648.84] P:1449.50 E:0.042794 |  And we've already played 22 minutes.
[1649.40 - 1650.92] P:1781.41 E:0.034084 |  Czech takes the Chelsea free kick.
[1650.92 - 1654.44] P:1617.11 E:0.034938 |  A water for the foul by Paul Scholes.
[1654.44 - 1655.88] P:1688.17 E:0.041759 |  It's headed away by Biric.
[1656.60 - 1659.16] P:1593.50 E:0.036867 |  And Scholes is still off receiving treatment at the moment.
[1659.16 - 1663.48] P:1603.10 E:0.036364 |  Tevez have managed to hold off Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard.
[1663.48 - 1664.92] P:1671.95 E:0.040785 |  Tevez forced a retreat though.
[1664.92 - 1665.72] P:1570.98 E:0.036950 |  Got into trouble.
[1665.72 - 1667.48] P:1640.34 E:0.037764 |  Here's Maluda to Lampard.
[1667.48 - 1668.84] P:1643.26 E:0.042131 |  Brown with a terrible challenge.
[1669.80 - 1670.52] P:1601.52 E:0.044911 |  Good disgrace.
[1670.52 - 1671.48] P:1546.72 E:0.037779 |  What happened there?
[1671.48 - 1674.60] P:1679.95 E:0.041222 |  Ball was played in confusion between Biric and Van Dazaar.
[1674.60 - 1675.88] P:1654.34 E:0.039254 |  And it's put behind for a corner.
[1675.88 - 1678.04] P:1849.81 E:0.034270 |  Yeah, Vigic played it safe there.
[1678.04 - 1680.84] P:1625.35 E:0.041261 |  I think he felt that although Van Dazaar was coming out,
[1680.84 - 1682.60] P:1753.71 E:0.043494 |  he could get his head on the ball.
[1682.60 - 1684.12] P:1881.80 E:0.039247 |  He's not prepared to leave it.
[1684.84 - 1689.08] P:1830.67 E:0.040691 |  Well, Brown was definitely guilty of a foul tackle there.
[1689.88 - 1692.76] P:1849.37 E:0.040182 |  And here's Droga putting Van Dazaar under pressure.
[1693.64 - 1696.20] P:1722.98 E:0.036630 |  I know we've passed the midway point of the first half.
[1696.20 - 1698.60] P:1812.51 E:0.036855 |  But we'll just see out this corner for Chelsea.
[1699.24 - 1702.60] P:1730.93 E:0.035561 |  Lampard to take it from the left side hitting it right footed.
[1703.72 - 1705.88] P:1729.75 E:0.041102 |  Chelsea putting pressure on Van Dazaar.
[1705.88 - 1707.48] P:1665.82 E:0.038062 |  Ball played in Terry Wendermere.
[1707.48 - 1708.84] P:1440.23 E:0.034643 |  It didn't make any contact.
[1708.84 - 1710.36] P:1419.23 E:0.035591 |  And it's behind for a goal kick.
[1710.36 - 1711.32] P:1504.05 E:0.044673 |  And here is my kick.
[1713.24 - 1715.72] P:1841.18 E:0.041083 |  Well, Scholes is still off the field.
[1715.72 - 1719.16] P:1691.35 E:0.039666 |  And it was very, very unclear as to whether the referee also
[1719.16 - 1720.52] P:1667.31 E:0.040886 |  showed a yellow card to McElhaney.
[1720.52 - 1723.08] P:1587.80 E:0.037804 |  But I'm just looking down at a chap in front of us
[1723.08 - 1724.04] P:1574.74 E:0.044634 |  who's got a monitor.
[1724.04 - 1725.08] P:1603.12 E:0.038379 |  He's doing all the stats.
[1725.08 - 1727.72] P:1616.03 E:0.041425 |  And it shows yellow card to McElhaney as well.
[1727.72 - 1729.16] P:1575.26 E:0.032860 |  But that's not official.
[1729.16 - 1733.24] P:1587.49 E:0.041038 |  But I thought, Graham, the stoppage came at a good time for Chelsea
[1733.24 - 1735.88] P:1500.00 E:0.040784 |  because it's broken up a bit of Manchester United tempo.
[1735.88 - 1737.24] P:1414.27 E:0.043927 |  I agree entirely with that.
[1737.24 - 1740.20] P:1489.58 E:0.031416 |  It broke it because Manchester United have certainly
[1740.20 - 1741.96] P:1346.71 E:0.030805 |  been the better team.
[1741.96 - 1745.72] P:1433.79 E:0.038273 |  The game hasn't really settled down into anything constructive yet.
[1745.72 - 1747.72] P:1688.10 E:0.042718 |  Joe Cole, and that's over hit the pass.
[1747.72 - 1749.32] P:1782.23 E:0.035749 |  You're listening to BBC Radio.
[1750.12 - 1751.40] P:1653.57 E:0.041450 |  The Champions League final.
[1752.12 - 1753.88] P:1813.07 E:0.041827 |  Manchester United, Niel, Chelsea, Niel.
[1753.96 - 1758.52] P:1666.92 E:0.032451 |  Scholes having been patched up, comes back on again for Manchester United,
[1758.52 - 1761.32] P:1578.10 E:0.034702 |  who are playing from left to right in this first half.
[1762.04 - 1767.40] P:1727.64 E:0.036672 |  So McElhaney and Scholes now both carrying yellow cards in this final.
[1768.44 - 1770.60] P:1526.70 E:0.036461 |  That's the norm, it seems, these days for Paul Scholes.
[1770.60 - 1774.12] P:1607.76 E:0.034791 |  And now Carlos Tevez finds the aforementioned Scholes,
[1774.12 - 1776.44] P:1666.84 E:0.038589 |  trying to make up for missing the final in 99.
[1776.44 - 1780.60] P:1848.97 E:0.037188 |  Rooney coming deep, finds Ronaldo over on the far side,
[1780.60 - 1781.96] P:1850.28 E:0.036051 |  cross comes Michael Essian.
[1781.96 - 1783.24] P:1817.51 E:0.037799 |  Rooney gives it to Evra.
[1783.24 - 1785.32] P:1779.40 E:0.043012 |  Goes for the return ball, but he won't get it.
[1786.04 - 1787.88] P:1668.45 E:0.043601 |  But certainly tactically so far,
[1788.68 - 1790.52] P:1736.64 E:0.041948 |  Sir Alex Ferguson winning this on points,
[1790.52 - 1792.68] P:1640.52 E:0.033441 |  and Avram Grant has to respond.
[1792.68 - 1796.12] P:1618.77 E:0.040131 |  In all of the preparation, I'm sure Ashley Cole would have been
[1796.12 - 1798.84] P:1521.67 E:0.030823 |  expecting to face Ronaldo.
[1798.84 - 1801.48] P:1416.91 E:0.034759 |  I'm sure Michael Essian wouldn't have been thinking
[1801.48 - 1803.32] P:1545.07 E:0.041144 |  that he would be up against Ronaldo.
[1803.32 - 1805.88] P:1459.27 E:0.032092 |  But that is exactly what's happening just at the moment.
[1806.92 - 1808.76] P:1684.01 E:0.040890 |  Throw into Chelsea over on the far side.
[1808.76 - 1811.88] P:1576.98 E:0.036117 |  Drogba trying to get into the game, and Chelsea win another throw.
[1812.52 - 1814.12] P:1304.68 E:0.045252 |  That's one thing that hasn't happened yet.
[1814.12 - 1815.88] P:1481.21 E:0.036154 |  Drogba certainly hasn't got into the game.
[1817.00 - 1818.84] P:1562.16 E:0.049219 |  Vindicis has competed very well with him
[1818.84 - 1821.56] P:1529.77 E:0.038514 |  when the occasional ball has been played up to Drogba.
[1821.56 - 1822.68] P:1451.48 E:0.039701 |  It will seem very little.
[1824.12 - 1826.68] P:1575.52 E:0.048828 |  Manchester United have the ball back inside their own half,
[1826.68 - 1828.20] P:1539.60 E:0.040685 |  and clearly the ball is not...
[1828.76 - 1831.48] P:1642.61 E:0.036036 |  I don't think rolling naturally at times on this surface here,
[1831.48 - 1834.04] P:1574.40 E:0.037953 |  it's bobbling around on this relay pitch.
[1834.92 - 1837.88] P:1566.44 E:0.031281 |  And Anderson is warming up, I understand.
[1837.88 - 1840.84] P:1687.45 E:0.041923 |  But that's normal, I suppose, with Scholes having just got the injury.
[1840.92 - 1843.96] P:1750.52 E:0.033954 |  But Anderson and Reingigs, at the moment of both,
[1843.96 - 1845.24] P:1813.71 E:0.036573 |  warming up for Manchester United,
[1845.24 - 1848.20] P:1696.74 E:0.031484 |  who have a free kick just inside the Chelsea half,
[1848.20 - 1850.92] P:1549.31 E:0.031741 |  and it's knocked off to Carrick inside the centre circle.
[1850.92 - 1852.52] P:1694.45 E:0.040637 |  Carrick's ball forward to Rooney.
[1852.52 - 1854.84] P:1717.74 E:0.037594 |  Rooney turning away from Maluda.
[1854.84 - 1856.52] P:1678.08 E:0.042590 |  Rooney lays it right to Hargreaves.
[1856.52 - 1858.44] P:1728.49 E:0.034849 |  Carrick's made a run into the area.
[1858.44 - 1860.04] P:1622.62 E:0.039395 |  Hargreaves can't get the cross,
[1860.04 - 1863.32] P:1571.77 E:0.037600 |  and a peel-for-hand ball by the fans there against Ashley Cole.
[1864.36 - 1866.04] P:1543.54 E:0.043033 |  They're throwing these balls on a little too quickly.
[1866.04 - 1869.00] P:1500.54 E:0.032800 |  They've got one on very quickly now for Hargreaves,
[1869.00 - 1871.48] P:1637.75 E:0.034735 |  and West Brown will take the throw for Manchester United.
[1872.12 - 1874.92] P:1603.07 E:0.043294 |  All the Chelsea fans, most of them behind the goal, they're defending.
[1876.04 - 1878.76] P:1618.29 E:0.044545 |  The United fans just making a little more noise at the moment.
[1879.32 - 1882.12] P:1671.69 E:0.037790 |  Brown and Scholes linking up down this near side.
[1882.12 - 1883.48] P:1687.29 E:0.044172 |  Brown with a left-footed ball.
[1883.48 - 1884.36] P:1777.88 E:0.041970 |  Burn!
[1884.36 - 1888.52] P:1672.71 E:0.049309 |  And Cristiano Ronaldo jumps on the ball close,
[1888.52 - 1891.96] P:1663.29 E:0.046212 |  and heads Manchester United into the lead.
[1891.96 - 1895.72] P:1534.74 E:0.046557 |  He talks about Ronaldo needing to deliver on the big stage.
[1896.28 - 1897.80] P:1621.13 E:0.045235 |  There's his response.
[1897.80 - 1899.56] P:1587.78 E:0.045073 |  Manchester United won.
[1899.56 - 1900.76] P:1485.18 E:0.048823 |  Chelsea Nils.
[1900.76 - 1903.64] P:1604.95 E:0.045212 |  Ronaldo's 42nd goal of the season.
[1905.24 - 1907.64] P:1649.31 E:0.045154 |  Well, he's coming completely unmarked.
[1907.64 - 1909.64] P:1648.18 E:0.041577 |  Essy and he's looking at himself.
[1909.64 - 1911.80] P:1516.86 E:0.044099 |  He'll be asking great questions on it.
[1911.80 - 1915.24] P:1565.08 E:0.045635 |  But when the ball comes in, Ronaldo comes in,
[1915.24 - 1918.36] P:1578.16 E:0.040277 |  and he heads it superbly down into the corner net.
[1918.36 - 1920.52] P:1554.31 E:0.037671 |  Pedicic, no chance whatsoever.
[1921.16 - 1922.36] P:1406.86 E:0.043198 |  Excellent header.
[1922.36 - 1924.04] P:1479.43 E:0.041991 |  One nil to Manchester United.
[1924.04 - 1925.88] P:1399.53 E:0.042125 |  I think that's a thoroughly deserved lead.
[1928.36 - 1931.40] P:1594.90 E:0.048549 |  Well, he scores all kinds of goals, Ronaldo.
[1932.28 - 1933.48] P:1596.93 E:0.048721 |  He's a tall player.
[1934.04 - 1935.24] P:1637.83 E:0.042517 |  He's very good in the air.
[1936.12 - 1940.60] P:1524.99 E:0.041513 |  And there is his response to anyone who doubts his ability
[1940.60 - 1943.08] P:1500.38 E:0.038059 |  to take a big game by the scrella of the net.
[1943.08 - 1945.00] P:1524.67 E:0.041090 |  Now Chelsea have to respond.
[1945.00 - 1947.16] P:1650.76 E:0.035727 |  Essy ends balling towards Grogba.
[1947.16 - 1948.52] P:1746.54 E:0.041802 |  It should be a better game now.
[1948.52 - 1951.48] P:1551.62 E:0.047341 |  And in the shot at the end, it's driven in by Michael Balak.
[1951.48 - 1953.48] P:1674.78 E:0.037401 |  It's gone a long way back for a goal kick.
[1953.48 - 1955.16] P:1576.81 E:0.035158 |  Let's get a comment from Stan Collin.
[1955.16 - 1956.52] P:1499.15 E:0.043235 |  Yeah, wonderful cross.
[1956.52 - 1957.24] P:1515.23 E:0.031588 |  Left-footed.
[1957.88 - 1958.44] P:1377.76 E:0.052383 |  Far post.
[1958.44 - 1959.72] P:1500.38 E:0.044819 |  Cristiano Ronaldo.
[1959.72 - 1961.80] P:1428.56 E:0.038074 |  My question was completely flat-footed.
[1961.80 - 1964.52] P:1459.32 E:0.039193 |  It has to be said about far post.
[1964.52 - 1967.88] P:1362.54 E:0.042074 |  And Ronaldo is six-foot plus, not even into the corner.
[1967.88 - 1970.28] P:1404.64 E:0.036400 |  But I think that the problem with Chelsea is
[1970.28 - 1972.76] P:1375.02 E:0.040365 |  is that they've matched up Manchester United.
[1972.76 - 1975.64] P:1349.48 E:0.042751 |  Very, very clever way to play a 4-4-2.
[1975.64 - 1979.24] P:1424.86 E:0.038855 |  Hargreaves is keeping Ashley Cole, put the ping right back.
[1979.88 - 1983.16] P:1397.82 E:0.043783 |  Cristiano Ronaldo with Essy, and the odd man out,
[1983.16 - 1985.96] P:1463.05 E:0.042533 |  Lord McAleigh, who really should be the extra man,
[1985.96 - 1987.56] P:1489.00 E:0.040223 |  is still sitting in front of his defender.
[1987.56 - 1990.44] P:1455.08 E:0.042510 |  So Manchester United, in the key midfield areas,
[1990.44 - 1992.68] P:1354.88 E:0.036450 |  are very good for numbers at the moment, Mike.
[1992.68 - 1995.24] P:1566.62 E:0.043748 |  Well, he's the leading scorer in the Champions League this season.
[1995.80 - 1997.32] P:1488.65 E:0.043926 |  That is his eighth goal.
[1997.32 - 1999.72] P:1616.66 E:0.032999 |  And now can Chelsea find a response here?
[1999.72 - 2000.36] P:1539.20 E:0.035249 |  They'll need to.
[2001.56 - 2003.16] P:1724.82 E:0.041255 |  Scoles for Manchester United.
[2003.88 - 2006.20] P:1659.60 E:0.044328 |  I've been very unkind to West Brown over the years
[2006.20 - 2008.12] P:1653.09 E:0.038860 |  in terms of delivering from the full-back position.
[2008.92 - 2012.76] P:1837.34 E:0.039905 |  And that one was brilliantly waited for Cristiano Ronaldo.
[2012.76 - 2015.56] P:1804.26 E:0.039110 |  Just to give the Chelsea fans some hope here, by the way.
[2015.64 - 2017.88] P:1786.61 E:0.036315 |  The last time we sat in this stadium,
[2017.88 - 2021.64] P:1683.56 E:0.037998 |  the team playing from left to right in the first half scored, first,
[2021.64 - 2022.52] P:1687.65 E:0.042251 |  led at half-time.
[2023.08 - 2026.60] P:1536.30 E:0.035233 |  In the second half, the other team came back to score two.
[2026.60 - 2027.72] P:1631.20 E:0.039477 |  Russia against England.
[2027.72 - 2028.60] P:1490.97 E:0.037914 |  Graham Taylor.
[2028.60 - 2031.08] P:1496.80 E:0.047765 |  Whether that will happen or not, we'll just have to wait and see.
[2031.08 - 2033.88] P:1453.53 E:0.042958 |  But I think in terms of how the game is gone,
[2033.88 - 2037.08] P:1546.69 E:0.041196 |  Manchester United do deserve to have taken that lead.
[2037.08 - 2038.76] P:1493.13 E:0.041179 |  There's not been a fantastic game,
[2038.76 - 2040.52] P:1420.88 E:0.038873 |  there's been a lot of edginess to it,
[2040.52 - 2042.52] P:1382.44 E:0.044873 |  not a lot of good control play,
[2042.52 - 2045.00] P:1525.20 E:0.038073 |  but certainly United have been the more positive
[2045.64 - 2047.24] P:1484.54 E:0.041604 |  and forward-looking side.
[2047.24 - 2048.92] P:1350.17 E:0.031006 |  They've played the better football.
[2048.92 - 2050.84] P:1697.52 E:0.041017 |  Should be a better game now, though, surely, Graham.
[2050.84 - 2052.84] P:1452.89 E:0.045823 |  Hopefully, you know what, this goal will open it up.
[2052.84 - 2055.48] P:1357.27 E:0.035376 |  But Chelsea have to get in, link in together.
[2055.48 - 2058.28] P:1347.25 E:0.039273 |  There's no supply into drug brutal at the moment.
[2058.28 - 2059.48] P:1618.11 E:0.038039 |  He's very isolated.
[2060.04 - 2063.32] P:1622.73 E:0.044361 |  A lot of people were saying 1-0 to Chelsea as a final score here.
[2063.32 - 2065.56] P:1627.49 E:0.035307 |  It's 1-0 to Manchester United.
[2065.56 - 2067.48] P:1617.98 E:0.043733 |  Ronaldo's done the trick once more,
[2067.48 - 2071.56] P:1660.51 E:0.037223 |  leaping up at the far post to head Manchester United into the lead.
[2071.56 - 2073.48] P:1741.70 E:0.040514 |  Chelsea have to get their game going now,
[2073.48 - 2076.04] P:1396.97 E:0.034623 |  but they've again misplaced the pass
[2076.04 - 2078.76] P:1547.78 E:0.039155 |  and Manchester United almost back in business again.
[2079.32 - 2082.44] P:1539.95 E:0.032745 |  Scoles over to the left-hand side.
[2082.44 - 2084.36] P:1610.46 E:0.046037 |  Ronaldo turning on the start,
[2084.36 - 2086.60] P:1463.51 E:0.044251 |  placed the ball down the line to Evera.
[2086.60 - 2088.92] P:1603.64 E:0.039229 |  There's no United player at the moment in the penalty area.
[2089.56 - 2092.20] P:1653.45 E:0.045461 |  Ronaldo again with the confidence and the goal here,
[2092.92 - 2095.32] P:1624.71 E:0.042363 |  just like George Best 40 years ago.
[2095.32 - 2097.72] P:1694.76 E:0.037472 |  Scoles now to this near side,
[2097.72 - 2100.76] P:1766.88 E:0.037357 |  and Manchester United deserve at the moment to be in front.
[2100.76 - 2102.36] P:1582.37 E:0.043018 |  Another ball played in by Brown,
[2102.44 - 2104.28] P:1671.25 E:0.036793 |  headed back in Cavalio clears,
[2104.28 - 2107.08] P:1693.22 E:0.039947 |  and again it was Ronaldo jumping at the far post.
[2107.08 - 2108.68] P:1683.18 E:0.047923 |  For Ronaldo, understandably,
[2108.68 - 2111.24] P:1723.88 E:0.037167 |  he's certainly got the beating of Essie and Nindiair,
[2111.24 - 2113.80] P:1612.69 E:0.036476 |  and there it's a header back across the face of the goal.
[2114.60 - 2118.36] P:1474.80 E:0.041545 |  So that ball, that delivery from either Brown or Hargreaves,
[2118.36 - 2119.48] P:1522.55 E:0.040511 |  it's very dangerous.
[2120.36 - 2122.12] P:1504.16 E:0.043259 |  Of course, the headed goal 40 years ago
[2122.12 - 2125.40] P:1574.13 E:0.037054 |  came from Bobby Charlton in that final against Ben Fieger.
[2125.40 - 2127.48] P:1619.23 E:0.041727 |  Here come Manchester United once more.
[2127.48 - 2129.40] P:1736.05 E:0.034637 |  Rooney hasn't just nicked away from him,
[2129.40 - 2130.92] P:1801.12 E:0.036791 |  and John Terry the Chelsea cap.
[2130.92 - 2133.64] P:1791.41 E:0.039505 |  Look at the gap though, as Chelsea clear towards Drogba,
[2133.64 - 2136.20] P:1661.78 E:0.037901 |  and there's nobody there for Drogba to,
[2136.20 - 2137.96] P:1765.01 E:0.036198 |  even if he gets it, to lay it off to.
[2138.52 - 2140.84] P:1621.35 E:0.040377 |  Joe Cole and Maluda are not in the game,
[2140.84 - 2143.72] P:1553.31 E:0.039102 |  and Avram Grant has to come up with some answers pretty quickly here,
[2144.36 - 2146.28] P:1533.79 E:0.043456 |  and Manchester United now bring the ball out,
[2146.28 - 2148.60] P:1669.55 E:0.040307 |  and Drogba's going down again, looking for attention.
[2149.24 - 2151.16] P:1674.67 E:0.042143 |  Scoles doesn't want to put the ball out of play,
[2151.16 - 2153.56] P:1637.29 E:0.044056 |  but now the referee closes whistle,
[2153.56 - 2155.32] P:1791.95 E:0.042304 |  it's out of play, it's down the line.
[2157.80 - 2160.28] P:1979.29 E:0.043988 |  Claude McAlay doesn't need to be doing that job,
[2160.36 - 2163.08] P:1970.67 E:0.040937 |  because quite simply because Carl Vallejo and Terry
[2163.08 - 2168.12] P:1871.47 E:0.036432 |  are playing against an Orthodox too now in Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.
[2168.12 - 2170.04] P:1787.14 E:0.034754 |  You've got three with McAlay Lee,
[2170.68 - 2172.68] P:1684.22 E:0.040068 |  he's doing no job whatsoever,
[2172.68 - 2175.08] P:1512.16 E:0.037731 |  because nobody's dropping off into that middle area
[2175.08 - 2178.20] P:1473.58 E:0.038265 |  when United do have a three, Tevez, Rooney and Ronaldo.
[2178.20 - 2180.76] P:1489.53 E:0.042299 |  To pick up Chelsea, you need to commit one more body,
[2180.76 - 2184.60] P:1532.60 E:0.038324 |  either up front or further forward in an advanced midfield position.
[2185.72 - 2188.12] P:1616.20 E:0.044711 |  Well, I think Drogba may recover.
[2188.84 - 2192.12] P:1584.16 E:0.042358 |  This, of course, may well be his last match for Chelsea.
[2192.12 - 2194.68] P:1596.37 E:0.042572 |  There's all sorts of speculation about his future.
[2194.68 - 2197.56] P:1568.26 E:0.044252 |  The Manchester United red and white flags to our left.
[2199.00 - 2202.84] P:1573.45 E:0.041480 |  They're the flags that we see being waved around this Moscow stadium
[2202.84 - 2206.12] P:1631.36 E:0.037369 |  just at the moment, but there's a long way still to go in this final.
[2206.12 - 2211.24] P:1614.31 E:0.035219 |  We played 31 minutes, you're listening to BBC Radio, live from Moscow.
[2211.96 - 2215.00] P:1682.67 E:0.041804 |  It's nearly 20 past 11 in the evening here.
[2215.72 - 2219.00] P:1643.09 E:0.036587 |  The ball is with Wes Brown and Manchester United.
[2220.04 - 2223.56] P:1737.45 E:0.041755 |  Surprise Chelsea, perhaps with the way they started here tonight.
[2223.56 - 2227.08] P:1637.98 E:0.040816 |  Hargris playing very well down the right, doubling up with Wes Brown.
[2227.08 - 2229.24] P:1731.19 E:0.039808 |  Ashley Cole's not getting forward at all.
[2229.24 - 2233.48] P:1648.38 E:0.037863 |  Essian's got his hands full over on the far side against Ronaldo.
[2233.48 - 2239.16] P:1710.25 E:0.035680 |  They really so far, Sir Alex and Carlos Kiros have outfoxed Chelsea.
[2239.72 - 2242.12] P:1516.33 E:0.042672 |  The ball back with Van Dazaar, who really has been
[2242.92 - 2244.76] P:1621.89 E:0.045434 |  unemployed so far in this final.
[2245.48 - 2249.24] P:1752.07 E:0.039527 |  Long clearance towards Ronaldo, looking for his height over on the far side.
[2249.24 - 2253.08] P:1670.33 E:0.033298 |  Takes the ball on the chest and the lovely backflip finds Evra.
[2253.08 - 2255.72] P:1858.60 E:0.040711 |  Skulls, it's all Manchester United just at the moment.
[2256.36 - 2259.16] P:1700.43 E:0.039531 |  Rooney linking with Carrick inside the centre circle.
[2259.72 - 2261.32] P:1694.49 E:0.040466 |  Carrick on to Rooney once more.
[2261.32 - 2264.44] P:1666.91 E:0.041198 |  He looked just down the right-hand side, but he's given it away.
[2264.44 - 2267.56] P:1707.97 E:0.039346 |  John Terry hammers it forward and again there's that big gap between Drogba
[2267.56 - 2270.84] P:1698.27 E:0.039717 |  and anyone else in blue and Manchester United win it back again.
[2270.84 - 2273.00] P:1566.99 E:0.036760 |  And Drogba's unable to be a threat at the moment.
[2273.00 - 2277.56] P:1662.26 E:0.034579 |  And now Rooney trying to find out in Hargris, but it's intercepted by Cavalio.
[2278.20 - 2283.32] P:1732.80 E:0.038435 |  Along the halfway line from Ashley Cole to Balak, who's really been quite anonymous so far.
[2283.88 - 2287.72] P:1943.58 E:0.038171 |  Joe Cole gives the ball back to Essian and now Balak once more.
[2288.36 - 2290.68] P:2000.25 E:0.041473 |  Balak, Chelsea just needing some possession here.
[2290.68 - 2293.56] P:1897.21 E:0.038771 |  They haven't been able to have the ball at all.
[2293.56 - 2295.56] P:1773.62 E:0.040232 |  In goes Wes Brown against Maluda.
[2295.56 - 2299.72] P:1745.34 E:0.035904 |  It was a pretty half-hearted challenge from Maluda and it's back inside the Chelsea half.
[2299.72 - 2304.28] P:1712.11 E:0.034064 |  A little bit of silliness then between mainly Maluda I think and Brown and now Terry.
[2304.28 - 2305.64] P:1830.71 E:0.038529 |  Terry to Maluda.
[2305.64 - 2307.88] P:1747.27 E:0.031631 |  Maluda needs to get into the game here.
[2307.88 - 2312.52] P:1748.47 E:0.036678 |  Ashley Cole for just about the first time inside the Manchester United half.
[2312.52 - 2316.28] P:1796.51 E:0.040469 |  Lampard holds off the challenge from Hargris, floats the ball in towards Drogba.
[2316.28 - 2318.52] P:1687.91 E:0.040394 |  Drogba's headed back, pressure from Balak.
[2318.52 - 2322.84] P:1711.56 E:0.038382 |  Burnham was in trouble and Manchester United eventually clear.
[2322.84 - 2324.12] P:1739.58 E:0.045397 |  It'll be a Chelsea corner.
[2324.68 - 2329.32] P:1629.95 E:0.043145 |  Although some good fortune there and van der Sar did very well to Chlorid away.
[2329.96 - 2333.24] P:1549.82 E:0.034720 |  With Drogba coming round at the back post, headed it back in and then
[2333.24 - 2337.96] P:1643.08 E:0.036947 |  I think it was Balak put great pressure on Ferdinand, not certain who actually got the header in.
[2337.96 - 2341.80] P:1748.18 E:0.039613 |  But if it hadn't been for van der Sar flooring away, flooring it away,
[2341.80 - 2343.96] P:1905.39 E:0.035660 |  that would have definitely been the Chelsea equaliser.
[2343.96 - 2345.48] P:1968.53 E:0.048684 |  Well that was the power of Chelsea.
[2346.36 - 2347.24] P:1812.49 E:0.043763 |  Here comes the corner.
[2347.24 - 2351.00] P:1738.93 E:0.040974 |  Van der Sar manages to palm it away out of the penalty area.
[2351.00 - 2352.76] P:1792.54 E:0.036313 |  Chelsea pick up the loose ball once more.
[2352.76 - 2355.48] P:1736.17 E:0.039977 |  Cavalio has stayed forward following the corner kick.
[2355.48 - 2359.16] P:1735.79 E:0.039077 |  He's got two Manchester United players with him, including his old friend Wayne Rooney.
[2359.24 - 2361.08] P:1710.60 E:0.044333 |  And Rooney's got the better of Cavalio.
[2361.08 - 2364.44] P:1675.71 E:0.041977 |  And now Cavalio's out of the defence as Rooney goes forward
[2364.44 - 2367.72] P:1742.43 E:0.039533 |  and hits it very long and ambitiously to the far side of the field.
[2367.72 - 2369.64] P:1784.84 E:0.038921 |  Ronaldo may get there first.
[2369.64 - 2371.72] P:1699.97 E:0.045252 |  Ronaldo's early ball in at Davis.
[2371.72 - 2373.16] P:1613.47 E:0.041936 |  Great out of Davis.
[2373.16 - 2374.60] P:1624.98 E:0.047484 |  Save, full comes out.
[2374.60 - 2377.72] P:1640.52 E:0.044063 |  Metherbate save from Pettichek to deny this time.
[2377.72 - 2378.84] P:1647.13 E:0.038757 |  Michael Carrick.
[2378.84 - 2381.56] P:1712.96 E:0.041429 |  Oh, thrilling football there by Manchester United.
[2381.56 - 2384.28] P:1762.69 E:0.035728 |  And Pettichek keeping Chelsea in the final.
[2384.28 - 2388.60] P:1821.55 E:0.038419 |  If Chelsea come through to win this final, they'll owe it to Pettichek.
[2389.16 - 2390.52] P:1756.88 E:0.041214 |  Two fantastic saves.
[2390.52 - 2392.52] P:1594.46 E:0.033202 |  The first one from Tevesh.
[2392.52 - 2393.88] P:1558.39 E:0.028621 |  It comes out.
[2393.88 - 2396.52] P:1490.43 E:0.038658 |  And Michael Carrick really does everything that is asked of him.
[2396.52 - 2399.56] P:1723.09 E:0.036192 |  But it's a tremendous save by the Chelsea goalkeeper.
[2400.52 - 2403.64] P:1832.16 E:0.041428 |  What a counterattack that was by Manchester United.
[2404.28 - 2405.56] P:1761.99 E:0.044294 |  Great header from Tevesh.
[2405.56 - 2407.56] P:1737.18 E:0.033775 |  Terrific save from Pettichek.
[2407.56 - 2410.92] P:1664.58 E:0.044491 |  And Michael Carrick looked as if he was going to roll it in for Manchester United.
[2410.92 - 2412.28] P:1812.14 E:0.042458 |  And Pettichek was there again.
[2413.00 - 2414.44] P:1814.84 E:0.040836 |  Corner to Manchester United.
[2415.00 - 2416.84] P:1665.46 E:0.042094 |  Over on the far side of the field.
[2416.84 - 2418.28] P:1702.61 E:0.044999 |  The left of being high balled.
[2418.28 - 2420.04] P:1662.32 E:0.032150 |  Chelsea trying to defend in number.
[2420.04 - 2422.92] P:1779.22 E:0.038264 |  And there was enough pressure there from the Chelsea defenders to make sure
[2422.92 - 2424.60] P:1721.81 E:0.042486 |  nobody in red could get that on target.
[2425.64 - 2431.00] P:1727.88 E:0.040071 |  Well, we may say that the quality of the players such hasn't all improved dramatically.
[2431.00 - 2432.20] P:1577.65 E:0.036890 |  It's still good.
[2432.20 - 2435.56] P:1510.97 E:0.034780 |  But what we have suddenly had, we've had goal mouth incidents.
[2435.56 - 2438.28] P:1530.21 E:0.034184 |  And that generally is what makes a game of football.
[2438.28 - 2439.80] P:1622.62 E:0.035383 |  It creates that excitement.
[2440.84 - 2445.56] P:1651.40 E:0.040821 |  Well, we've talked about the great players on the big stage in these European finals.
[2446.20 - 2452.92] P:1505.06 E:0.035590 |  We remember the likes of Zinedine Zidane, of course, for Real Madrid in particular.
[2452.92 - 2457.48] P:1634.47 E:0.038832 |  And tonight Cristiano Ronaldo, much coveted, of course, by Real Madrid,
[2457.48 - 2461.48] P:1683.20 E:0.036726 |  has headed Manchester United into a deserved lead here in Moscow.
[2461.48 - 2463.56] P:1778.77 E:0.040314 |  Tevesh now giving the ball to Ronaldo.
[2463.56 - 2464.76] P:1603.63 E:0.037477 |  Backflip from Ronaldo.
[2464.76 - 2467.08] P:1720.73 E:0.036153 |  Tevesh, I don't think we'll get that against John Terry,
[2467.08 - 2469.24] P:1641.12 E:0.031373 |  who stays the back pass back to Czech.
[2469.24 - 2472.44] P:1763.29 E:0.036857 |  And Czech just manages to get rid before Runeo bounces.
[2472.52 - 2475.80] P:1639.16 E:0.045420 |  I don't think John Terry was quite aware where Runeo was.
[2476.52 - 2481.72] P:1476.27 E:0.034486 |  And Petr Cech had to get rid of that ball as Runeo came in on him.
[2481.72 - 2484.52] P:1608.47 E:0.031635 |  Throw to Manchester United into Tevesh.
[2484.52 - 2486.76] P:1419.68 E:0.047171 |  Tevesh with a lovely ball square to Hargreaves.
[2486.76 - 2487.88] P:1610.00 E:0.032089 |  Hargreaves into character.
[2487.88 - 2491.08] P:1644.23 E:0.026847 |  There's better movement here from Manchester United.
[2491.08 - 2493.00] P:1778.50 E:0.045114 |  Hargreaves again, wide on the right.
[2493.00 - 2495.48] P:1728.32 E:0.033054 |  Can't get the cross in this time against Ashley Coley.
[2495.48 - 2498.52] P:1825.68 E:0.035234 |  He's looking for a corner kick, but it doesn't reach the corner.
[2498.52 - 2502.12] P:1797.76 E:0.038772 |  It's going to be a throw to Manchester United deep inside the Chelsea half.
[2502.12 - 2508.12] P:1712.35 E:0.033364 |  Manchester United won Chelsea, Nill, BBC Radio, live from Moscow.
[2508.76 - 2510.12] P:1487.03 E:0.032761 |  And that's a goal kick.
[2510.12 - 2513.24] P:1624.61 E:0.036016 |  My theory about Czech's outfit, the orange,
[2513.24 - 2516.52] P:1711.99 E:0.036239 |  was maybe that was in preparation for the penalty shootout.
[2516.52 - 2519.16] P:1719.39 E:0.041216 |  But we may not get that far now, unless Chelsea can respond.
[2519.88 - 2521.24] P:1648.95 E:0.044749 |  Well, there we are.
[2521.24 - 2523.40] P:1700.78 E:0.044948 |  We can't say that actually they hit that orange.
[2523.40 - 2524.52] P:1691.32 E:0.042604 |  He threw himself at it.
[2524.52 - 2526.28] P:1782.59 E:0.036264 |  He's brought up two great saves.
[2527.40 - 2530.12] P:1830.44 E:0.046324 |  World class keeper, of course, Czech, but his team are trailing.
[2530.20 - 2532.36] P:1737.70 E:0.031573 |  And Drogba is looking a little frustrated.
[2532.36 - 2535.56] P:1717.60 E:0.038583 |  But there was a moment to encourage Chelsea when Balak got forward
[2535.56 - 2537.24] P:1734.77 E:0.034456 |  and Ferdinand had a few problems.
[2537.24 - 2540.04] P:1858.51 E:0.037205 |  And now Esián is adjudged to a foul Ronaldo.
[2540.04 - 2544.36] P:1764.46 E:0.036799 |  But Ronaldo is doing it so far in this final for Manchester United.
[2545.16 - 2547.24] P:1516.65 E:0.041579 |  Playing over on that left-hand side of the field
[2547.24 - 2551.56] P:1586.59 E:0.036818 |  and ensuring that Esián, who loves to power forward, can't do it,
[2552.44 - 2553.48] P:1610.24 E:0.041366 |  cannot take the chance.
[2554.36 - 2557.08] P:1739.99 E:0.034807 |  Vittic with a free kick to Manchester United.
[2557.72 - 2560.12] P:1649.46 E:0.044571 |  Into the Chelsea half, Rooney against Terry.
[2560.12 - 2564.52] P:1396.59 E:0.032916 |  They both missed it and it'll drop to Petrček once more.
[2564.52 - 2566.44] P:1524.90 E:0.044525 |  Let's have another word from Stan Kolimov.
[2566.44 - 2567.32] P:1717.58 E:0.033172 |  Stan, how do you see it?
[2567.32 - 2571.16] P:1351.75 E:0.041137 |  Well, that move was delicious, was the word that sprang to my mind.
[2571.16 - 2573.40] P:1492.68 E:0.042531 |  It all came from Ricardo Carvalho, of course,
[2573.40 - 2575.40] P:1585.54 E:0.035588 |  trying to chase the game for Chelsea.
[2575.40 - 2578.44] P:1389.22 E:0.041250 |  Gave it to Wayne Rooney who galloped 40-50 yards
[2578.44 - 2580.20] P:1111.81 E:0.034950 |  and played that wonderful diagonal ball.
[2580.92 - 2582.60] P:1233.73 E:0.050937 |  Really wonderful move all round.
[2582.60 - 2585.72] P:1773.57 E:0.031737 |  And I still think, just looking at the options really,
[2585.72 - 2589.16] P:1585.17 E:0.038592 |  I think that McAley's job is completely redundant there,
[2589.16 - 2592.04] P:1646.97 E:0.038844 |  sitting in front of Terry and Carvalho.
[2592.04 - 2593.48] P:1713.76 E:0.036857 |  Because I keep going back to this point,
[2593.48 - 2596.68] P:1685.09 E:0.038472 |  that Tevez and Wayne Rooney are playing as a two-up front.
[2596.68 - 2600.04] P:1673.96 E:0.037283 |  So why not bring Nicholas and Elcarón, give more of an option
[2600.76 - 2604.52] P:1518.00 E:0.033393 |  with the likes of Frank Lampard getting up in support
[2604.52 - 2606.60] P:1567.59 E:0.038674 |  of two-up front with Drogbab, because at the moment,
[2606.60 - 2609.32] P:1581.68 E:0.038301 |  it's all Manchester United in that killer final third.
[2609.32 - 2611.40] P:1661.50 E:0.037876 |  A lot of danger coming down that left-hand side,
[2611.40 - 2612.60] P:1775.98 E:0.036505 |  as you'd expect from Ronaldo.
[2612.60 - 2614.84] P:1647.99 E:0.047762 |  And we're probably able to see here why Chelsea
[2614.84 - 2617.88] P:1667.33 E:0.037320 |  have already bought themselves a new right back for next season
[2618.60 - 2620.04] P:1542.87 E:0.045226 |  from Porto, the single-up.
[2620.04 - 2623.64] P:1535.53 E:0.035753 |  He'll be playing for them next season, but not tonight, obviously.
[2623.64 - 2625.96] P:1395.30 E:0.040831 |  And now, S&M into Maluda.
[2625.96 - 2629.00] P:1896.24 E:0.037857 |  Maluda turns and shows far too much of the ball to Paul Scholes
[2629.56 - 2631.56] P:1734.38 E:0.038750 |  and United are back in business once more.
[2632.28 - 2635.96] P:1780.26 E:0.040022 |  They have the cohesion so far in this game in midfield.
[2636.52 - 2638.36] P:1439.45 E:0.042049 |  They seem the better prepared at the moment,
[2638.36 - 2642.20] P:1433.63 E:0.037647 |  but still a long, long way to go in this Champions League final.
[2643.00 - 2645.64] P:1695.72 E:0.041000 |  Viddic, United fans sing their songs,
[2645.64 - 2650.44] P:1543.66 E:0.041599 |  and Viddic decides to turn the ball back once more to Edwin van der Sar.
[2650.44 - 2653.56] P:1476.39 E:0.040672 |  There was a big mosaic in red and white away to the left,
[2653.56 - 2656.60] P:1644.43 E:0.034931 |  which spelled out the word, believe before the game.
[2656.60 - 2659.16] P:1667.78 E:0.039609 |  Well, at the moment, those fans, those Manchester United fans,
[2659.16 - 2662.44] P:1480.67 E:0.042818 |  very definitely believe that this is going to be their year.
[2662.44 - 2664.60] P:1585.92 E:0.040950 |  They lead Chelsea by one goal to nil.
[2665.16 - 2666.68] P:1723.63 E:0.037487 |  Can Chelsea respond?
[2667.32 - 2669.72] P:1733.86 E:0.040918 |  They're playing very slowly at the moment, though, Chelsea.
[2669.72 - 2672.36] P:1749.15 E:0.035362 |  They just look to try and get a bit of a foothold here.
[2672.92 - 2676.28] P:1793.86 E:0.037639 |  McAleely to Joe Cole, awkward to control, but he's got it.
[2676.28 - 2678.84] P:1761.79 E:0.035176 |  Balak now pops up down that right-hand side of the field.
[2678.84 - 2680.60] P:1839.15 E:0.034621 |  Skims the ball in with his left foot.
[2680.60 - 2681.80] P:1765.89 E:0.042864 |  Maluda into McAleely.
[2681.80 - 2684.28] P:1870.96 E:0.030811 |  Seems surprised to get that one, McAleely.
[2684.28 - 2685.64] P:1896.35 E:0.042600 |  Lays it off to Terry.
[2685.64 - 2687.40] P:1983.84 E:0.038773 |  Terry now to Ashley Cole.
[2687.40 - 2689.40] P:1944.03 E:0.038803 |  Halfway inside the Manchester United half,
[2689.40 - 2691.56] P:1974.73 E:0.040965 |  but it's a bit pedestrian here from Chelsea.
[2691.56 - 2693.88] P:1890.58 E:0.038520 |  And Terry now almost gets in difficulty,
[2693.88 - 2697.32] P:1874.39 E:0.036760 |  and McAleely helps him out, and now it's moved on to Michael Essian.
[2697.32 - 2698.52] P:1893.94 E:0.041399 |  Essian to the other Michael.
[2698.52 - 2700.28] P:1917.18 E:0.040038 |  Balak into Maluda.
[2700.28 - 2702.68] P:1859.76 E:0.032195 |  What a poor first touch, though, by the Frenchman.
[2702.68 - 2705.72] P:1750.16 E:0.035354 |  And Manchester United looking to another Frenchman, Everett, to clear.
[2705.72 - 2708.92] P:1799.44 E:0.035126 |  He's hit that very quickly, though, back into the Chelsea half, and checks there.
[2708.92 - 2711.48] P:1779.48 E:0.037785 |  First period of controlled play by Chelsea.
[2712.04 - 2713.96] P:1770.76 E:0.042106 |  And it was in the Manchester United half.
[2713.96 - 2716.44] P:1640.79 E:0.038338 |  They need to be doing much, much more of that.
[2717.16 - 2719.08] P:1892.85 E:0.041701 |  Five minutes to go in the first half,
[2719.64 - 2723.56] P:1862.07 E:0.040810 |  and Manchester United lead through yet another Ronaldo goal.
[2723.56 - 2726.12] P:1891.30 E:0.044347 |  John Terry, that's a lovely ball forward to Ashley Cole.
[2726.12 - 2727.24] P:1793.37 E:0.036302 |  Brown has to be careful.
[2727.80 - 2730.92] P:1659.55 E:0.041146 |  And Brown's challenge, well, it wasn't the greatest,
[2730.92 - 2733.56] P:1803.37 E:0.037929 |  but Cole slipped, I think he'd lost possession anyway,
[2733.56 - 2736.52] P:1692.57 E:0.039039 |  and the ball tumbles away for a Manchester United goal kick.
[2736.52 - 2740.36] P:1488.24 E:0.037898 |  I have to say, Mike, I wondered whether Ashley Cole could have just kept his balance.
[2740.36 - 2742.76] P:1459.10 E:0.034786 |  Perhaps I'm being harsh, looking at it again.
[2742.76 - 2744.92] P:1391.84 E:0.042909 |  I just wondered if he could have kept the balance,
[2744.92 - 2749.24] P:1399.64 E:0.037224 |  and he literally got round and chose not to do, and it came to nothing.
[2749.24 - 2751.32] P:1383.41 E:0.040117 |  A referee thought it was a perfectly fair challenge.
[2751.88 - 2754.20] P:1587.63 E:0.040199 |  Stan saying that Drogba's going to need better support,
[2754.20 - 2757.80] P:1739.71 E:0.040779 |  and surely Abram Grant is going to need more from Flora Maluda
[2757.80 - 2760.12] P:1756.92 E:0.034633 |  if he's going to stay in this final for much longer.
[2760.12 - 2761.88] P:1583.29 E:0.035313 |  He's got many options, of course.
[2761.88 - 2765.40] P:1697.63 E:0.034936 |  He's got Calou, he's got a Nelka, he's got Chebchenko.
[2766.04 - 2767.24] P:1704.69 E:0.044918 |  Players who can turn a game.
[2768.44 - 2769.32] P:1659.75 E:0.043569 |  He may need them.
[2769.32 - 2772.52] P:1771.89 E:0.038383 |  Manchester United lead, Chelsea by one goal to nil.
[2772.52 - 2777.08] P:1755.74 E:0.035492 |  On BBC Radio, it's Skoles with a delicate little chip now for Wes Brown.
[2777.08 - 2779.24] P:1799.40 E:0.037227 |  Hargreaves ahead of him down this near side.
[2779.24 - 2782.04] P:1664.06 E:0.038019 |  That's been pretty formidable down the right so far.
[2782.04 - 2783.32] P:1586.36 E:0.035696 |  Hargreaves and Brown.
[2783.40 - 2786.20] P:1714.39 E:0.039508 |  Brown seems happy to have Hargreaves in front of him as well,
[2786.20 - 2789.80] P:1825.86 E:0.036184 |  because he's just going to give him that little bit of extra defensive protection too,
[2789.80 - 2791.24] P:1763.89 E:0.034120 |  and United have a free kick.
[2791.24 - 2794.84] P:1530.85 E:0.030845 |  I think Hargreaves has played extremely well down this right hand side.
[2794.84 - 2797.40] P:1359.89 E:0.043441 |  Not only has he whipped those crosses in, you're quite right.
[2797.40 - 2800.20] P:1602.73 E:0.033667 |  He's protected Wes Brown when necessary.
[2800.20 - 2802.60] P:1611.36 E:0.038933 |  It's a very good decision by Alex Ferguson.
[2802.60 - 2805.32] P:1682.35 E:0.040623 |  Fabio Capello, I'm sure, is making note as well.
[2805.32 - 2807.08] P:1738.78 E:0.039811 |  How well that combination's doing.
[2807.08 - 2810.12] P:1732.94 E:0.038961 |  The all-English combination down the Manchester United right,
[2810.12 - 2812.12] P:1748.46 E:0.043499 |  but it's Portugal's Cristiana Ronaldo.
[2812.12 - 2816.36] P:1777.10 E:0.034780 |  Inevitably, perhaps, who scored the goal here to give United the lead.
[2816.36 - 2818.36] P:1805.66 E:0.033813 |  A header after 26 minutes.
[2818.36 - 2822.44] P:1860.63 E:0.037265 |  Back come Chelsea, and Balak's being allowed to run a long way with the ball.
[2822.44 - 2825.72] P:1958.63 E:0.035189 |  Still Balak, he checks, and then plays it into Joe Cole.
[2825.72 - 2828.92] P:1901.66 E:0.040374 |  Cole, just on the edge of the area, United backing off.
[2828.92 - 2831.56] P:1889.92 E:0.032840 |  It's Balak once more trying to orchestrate something.
[2831.56 - 2833.32] P:1798.71 E:0.043352 |  Slams the ball straight at Carrick.
[2833.32 - 2836.76] P:1777.84 E:0.041497 |  United look to Hargreaves once more to bring it out strongly,
[2836.76 - 2839.32] P:1722.73 E:0.039818 |  and he's got Rooney and Tevez ahead of him.
[2839.32 - 2841.08] P:1831.65 E:0.036138 |  Hargreaves plays it into Rooney.
[2841.16 - 2842.76] P:1729.43 E:0.033718 |  Cavalio comes across.
[2842.76 - 2844.52] P:1699.25 E:0.046360 |  Rooney's only got Tevez in the area.
[2844.52 - 2845.88] P:1751.87 E:0.044101 |  Tries to pick him out!
[2845.88 - 2851.00] P:1623.02 E:0.039733 |  Oh, there's a slip by McAleely, and Tevez almost got there, and it's gone wide.
[2851.00 - 2854.20] P:1699.57 E:0.034578 |  Well, as Akta was knocked in the cross-in,
[2854.20 - 2856.12] P:1847.00 E:0.038128 |  McAleely misses it, came to it.
[2856.12 - 2860.28] P:1789.34 E:0.036257 |  Tevez coming in, just tried to pick it up, so it's so late,
[2860.28 - 2862.36] P:1727.68 E:0.026993 |  but just got the touch on it.
[2862.36 - 2865.08] P:1601.42 E:0.040355 |  If he got the firm touch and seen it all of the way,
[2865.08 - 2867.88] P:1385.84 E:0.034960 |  then that undoubtedly would have been too nilty-united.
[2867.88 - 2870.44] P:1822.78 E:0.041797 |  Just at the moment, all together, two-sharp.
[2871.08 - 2873.08] P:1740.82 E:0.035687 |  Manchester United for Chelsea.
[2873.08 - 2875.96] P:1755.72 E:0.034603 |  The likes of Ronaldo and Rooney and Tevez.
[2875.96 - 2880.20] P:1760.23 E:0.038369 |  And now Michael Balak starting to come into the game just a little more for Chelsea,
[2880.20 - 2881.48] P:1748.34 E:0.024530 |  as he'll need to.
[2881.48 - 2883.16] P:1870.13 E:0.037702 |  It's Claude McAleely.
[2883.16 - 2884.52] P:1863.77 E:0.044845 |  McAleely to Maluda.
[2884.52 - 2885.80] P:1820.03 E:0.041591 |  That's a better touch from Maluda.
[2885.80 - 2886.92] P:1516.68 E:0.051618 |  Lampard in the area!
[2887.64 - 2890.28] P:1740.81 E:0.037610 |  Lampard's gone down in the area,
[2891.08 - 2896.76] P:1764.27 E:0.034942 |  and the offense has been given right outside by Río Ferdinand.
[2897.64 - 2900.12] P:1752.93 E:0.040809 |  The referee gives the free kick to Chelsea.
[2900.12 - 2901.80] P:1790.13 E:0.032775 |  A couple of feet outside.
[2901.80 - 2903.00] P:1557.26 E:0.041473 |  Yellow cards him as well.
[2904.52 - 2909.32] P:1595.85 E:0.041354 |  You know, the referee looked at that and looked at Ferdinand as a deliberate step across.
[2909.32 - 2910.20] P:1456.02 E:0.040639 |  Frank Lampard.
[2910.84 - 2912.84] P:1659.39 E:0.036210 |  And it's right on the edge of the box here.
[2913.96 - 2917.16] P:1684.17 E:0.040674 |  Well, how many times have we seen this over the years?
[2918.20 - 2921.00] P:1804.22 E:0.043501 |  Chelsea have been second best throughout this first half,
[2921.00 - 2924.60] P:1809.18 E:0.033549 |  but as first, as halftime approaches now here in Moscow,
[2925.64 - 2926.92] P:1893.00 E:0.039439 |  this could be an opportunity.
[2927.56 - 2930.52] P:1842.95 E:0.037435 |  This could be a way back into this final for them.
[2930.52 - 2933.08] P:1943.18 E:0.038444 |  This could change the dressing room atmosphere at halftime.
[2933.88 - 2935.40] P:1951.43 E:0.032637 |  Droga and Balak.
[2935.40 - 2937.32] P:1909.75 E:0.042088 |  Remember the fallout between them recently?
[2938.60 - 2940.12] P:1960.35 E:0.046762 |  As to who should take the free kick?
[2941.48 - 2946.52] P:1929.92 E:0.039271 |  This is a couple of feet, no more, outside the penalty area to the left as we look at it.
[2946.52 - 2948.44] P:1847.94 E:0.038519 |  Lampard's talking to both players.
[2949.00 - 2951.88] P:1935.22 E:0.042308 |  Chelsea's Maluda is going into the Manchester United wall.
[2952.76 - 2955.24] P:1837.85 E:0.044132 |  And Van Dessart, who's had to do very little so far,
[2956.20 - 2958.52] P:1905.49 E:0.037025 |  prepares himself away to our left.
[2959.48 - 2962.12] P:1836.78 E:0.040841 |  It's going to be Michael Balak over the ball.
[2962.84 - 2964.44] P:1702.46 E:0.041398 |  And a goal kept to Manchester United.
[2965.00 - 2968.12] P:1801.77 E:0.040329 |  Always had the feeling it was going to be Balak on this occasion.
[2968.12 - 2973.48] P:1698.44 E:0.036058 |  One step, trying to swing it into behind the area that the wall was protecting.
[2973.48 - 2977.64] P:1520.30 E:0.040154 |  Difficult to do on the edge of the box to get it up over such a tall wall
[2977.64 - 2979.08] P:1523.66 E:0.032687 |  and then get it down again.
[2979.08 - 2980.60] P:1406.47 E:0.037057 |  He wasn't able to achieve it.
[2981.32 - 2986.28] P:1527.37 E:0.031803 |  We are approaching halftime here in Russia, in Moscow.
[2986.28 - 2992.04] P:1590.09 E:0.034502 |  Manchester United leading by one goal to nil against Chelsea.
[2992.04 - 2995.48] P:1658.50 E:0.040734 |  When we were here in October, one nil to England at halftime.
[2996.68 - 2999.64] P:1558.07 E:0.035992 |  And it was looking pretty good at that stage for Steve McLaren.
[2999.64 - 3001.40] P:1727.10 E:0.028529 |  Wayne Rooney having scored.
[3002.36 - 3004.52] P:1658.02 E:0.032751 |  Russia sorted themselves out in the second half.
[3005.32 - 3007.08] P:1503.48 E:0.026101 |  And they got the two goals that mattered.
[3007.56 - 3009.08] P:1611.21 E:0.023301 |  In that goal away to our right.
[3009.16 - 3012.12] P:1771.06 E:0.039437 |  And here come Chelsea for perhaps the last time in this first half.
[3012.12 - 3013.00] P:1872.37 E:0.038727 |  Meluda.
[3013.48 - 3014.76] P:1834.63 E:0.031574 |  United don't clear it.
[3014.76 - 3016.76] P:1774.97 E:0.034963 |  Balak and now Essie and drives forward.
[3016.76 - 3018.04] P:1884.73 E:0.041577 |  And Essie and is falling.
[3018.04 - 3019.16] P:1623.56 E:0.035870 |  Hasn't been clear.
[3021.88 - 3023.96] P:1881.61 E:0.033630 |  Will step in and score for Chelsea.
[3024.60 - 3026.28] P:1835.95 E:0.034485 |  Right at the end of the first half.
[3027.00 - 3029.32] P:1740.21 E:0.031232 |  Frank Lampard pops up from nowhere.
[3030.20 - 3034.44] P:1745.45 E:0.034793 |  And what a moment for him emotionally in this Champions League final.
[3034.44 - 3037.24] P:1789.32 E:0.037443 |  After so much sadness for his family.
[3038.20 - 3039.40] P:1742.91 E:0.022222 |  In recent weeks.
[3039.40 - 3040.76] P:1723.57 E:0.034244 |  Right on halftime.
[3041.32 - 3042.60] P:1766.00 E:0.027713 |  Against the run of play.
[3042.60 - 3045.96] P:1780.73 E:0.039199 |  Chelsea equalise here through Frank Lampard.
[3045.96 - 3047.64] P:1590.67 E:0.029584 |  Well, Essie comes in.
[3047.64 - 3049.16] P:1796.41 E:0.041729 |  He has the shot.
[3049.16 - 3051.08] P:1712.83 E:0.031891 |  And it's all about look.
[3051.08 - 3053.80] P:1804.05 E:0.038013 |  Because it comes in and it deflects.
[3053.80 - 3057.08] P:1786.06 E:0.029210 |  And not certain which match of United play to start with.
[3057.08 - 3059.96] P:1729.06 E:0.039359 |  Then it deflects again off Rio Ferdinand.
[3059.96 - 3063.16] P:1687.84 E:0.036214 |  And it drops so invitingly to Frank Lampard.
[3063.16 - 3064.68] P:1455.43 E:0.037140 |  He just puts it away.
[3064.68 - 3066.44] P:1701.21 E:0.039490 |  He just puts it away.
[3066.44 - 3068.20] P:1763.97 E:0.040297 |  You know what is good luck for someone.
[3068.20 - 3069.88] P:1696.80 E:0.038496 |  He's bad luck for another one.
[3069.88 - 3072.52] P:1789.51 E:0.035303 |  And it's certainly the good luck favourite Chelsea then.
[3072.52 - 3074.76] P:1549.64 E:0.036699 |  But they've taken full advantage of it.
[3074.76 - 3075.40] P:1533.52 E:0.047595 |  One-one.
[3078.12 - 3081.16] P:1633.43 E:0.041837 |  And we have played the fall 45 minutes.
[3081.16 - 3084.44] P:1645.85 E:0.037241 |  I have no idea how much added time we're going to get here.
[3085.24 - 3088.68] P:1655.26 E:0.038587 |  But talking about changing dressing room atmospheres at halftime.
[3089.48 - 3093.16] P:1735.42 E:0.036839 |  Having been so much second best here in the first half, Chelsea.
[3093.80 - 3095.80] P:1645.61 E:0.043532 |  Frank Lampard has equalised for them.
[3096.52 - 3099.48] P:1681.40 E:0.038915 |  And look at the effect it's had on them and their supporters now.
[3099.48 - 3101.08] P:1676.57 E:0.038091 |  As Spallack drives one wide.
[3101.96 - 3105.08] P:1656.21 E:0.033392 |  And, well, they're just making an announcement about the added time.
[3105.08 - 3105.72] P:1618.50 E:0.037350 |  Didn't hear it.
[3105.72 - 3107.08] P:1667.56 E:0.034036 |  Two minutes of added time.
[3107.08 - 3108.84] P:1610.06 E:0.039332 |  Stan Collinmore, what have you got to say?
[3108.84 - 3112.44] P:1608.17 E:0.033725 |  Well, Chelsea have taken their little piece of luck.
[3112.44 - 3114.12] P:1669.27 E:0.033100 |  Two deflections.
[3114.12 - 3117.24] P:1539.11 E:0.042301 |  It has to be said, the last one off Rio Ferdinand for Frank Lampard.
[3117.24 - 3117.80] P:1610.03 E:0.039970 |  It's up in.
[3118.36 - 3121.40] P:1577.28 E:0.036761 |  But that's the added bonus of having an attack in midfield.
[3121.48 - 3125.00] P:1709.90 E:0.035409 |  Chelsea just haven't got into those positions all the way through this half.
[3125.00 - 3128.20] P:1670.56 E:0.034508 |  I just wonder if now Abram Grant might decide to stick,
[3128.20 - 3130.52] P:1517.86 E:0.037166 |  keep McAlea as that defensive midfielder,
[3130.52 - 3132.44] P:1666.31 E:0.035320 |  or be bold in the second half,
[3132.44 - 3135.56] P:1619.52 E:0.034441 |  and add somebody like Solomon Clue or Nicholas and Elka.
[3135.56 - 3136.52] P:1529.10 E:0.038612 |  Back on a knife edge.
[3138.12 - 3138.76] P:1798.50 E:0.042201 |  Thank you, Stan.
[3138.76 - 3141.32] P:1640.65 E:0.032178 |  And while all that was happening,
[3141.32 - 3143.56] P:1701.62 E:0.041019 |  a poor challenge by Ricardo Cavallio
[3143.56 - 3145.72] P:1730.98 E:0.038257 |  on his fellow countryman Cristiano Ronaldo.
[3146.36 - 3149.32] P:1603.97 E:0.035265 |  And then there's a few things happening afterwards.
[3149.32 - 3152.44] P:1716.01 E:0.042078 |  And McAlea on a yellow card has to really, really calm down.
[3153.00 - 3157.32] P:1581.56 E:0.034654 |  So Cavallio went right through on Ronaldo there
[3157.32 - 3158.44] P:1550.04 E:0.042193 |  and got a yellow card.
[3158.44 - 3161.56] P:1730.88 E:0.037117 |  So we had four yellow cards, I think now in this first half, Graham.
[3161.56 - 3163.08] P:1603.50 E:0.046463 |  Yes, I mean, the referee has seen it.
[3163.08 - 3165.64] P:1552.73 E:0.046538 |  You can't argue really with whatever he's done.
[3166.20 - 3167.32] P:1655.61 E:0.044334 |  You have to be very careful.
[3167.32 - 3168.68] P:1622.66 E:0.038636 |  It goes into the second half.
[3168.68 - 3172.12] P:1551.20 E:0.038507 |  You can now, you know, feel that tension and feel the tensors,
[3172.12 - 3174.68] P:1657.86 E:0.039081 |  and then see the reactions of the players on the pitch.
[3174.68 - 3177.40] P:1461.95 E:0.038818 |  So one or two players are going to have to be very, very careful.
[3177.48 - 3181.48] P:1739.52 E:0.035335 |  How frustrating it must be for Sir Alex Ferguson
[3181.48 - 3184.44] P:1768.59 E:0.044503 |  and Carlos Kieros as the referee sends them to the dressing room
[3184.44 - 3187.64] P:1900.58 E:0.041233 |  because they got just about everything right in that first half
[3188.28 - 3192.20] P:1870.25 E:0.037596 |  and fully deserved to go in front through Cristiano Ronaldo's header
[3192.20 - 3194.20] P:1843.68 E:0.036944 |  from Wes Brown's ball in.
[3195.00 - 3197.88] P:1849.49 E:0.033923 |  He just had too much at the far post for Ession
[3198.68 - 3202.52] P:1759.54 E:0.036499 |  and Ronaldo duly headed Manchester United in front.
[3202.52 - 3204.36] P:1798.40 E:0.043705 |  And then, and I don't know how important this could be
[3204.36 - 3206.44] P:1790.63 E:0.035284 |  come the end of the day, a couple of fantastic saves
[3207.16 - 3210.76] P:1748.71 E:0.034335 |  from Pedecek to deny Carlos Tevez and Michael Karak.
[3210.76 - 3213.24] P:1759.89 E:0.037675 |  And Chelsea right at the end of the first half,
[3213.24 - 3216.52] P:1702.09 E:0.035502 |  riding their luck, get the equaliser through Frank Lampard.
[3216.52 - 3219.16] P:1721.83 E:0.035664 |  So it's really set us up here for the second half.
[3219.16 - 3223.24] P:1778.02 E:0.035213 |  The halftime score being Manchester United won, Chelsea won.
[3224.36 - 3227.40] P:1780.79 E:0.048496 |  It ain't pretty, but it's the way we like it in the Premier League
[3227.40 - 3228.92] P:1852.38 E:0.033868 |  and that first half in the end,
[3228.92 - 3232.52] P:1952.27 E:0.036096 |  an extraordinary climax with that Chelsea equaliser
[3232.52 - 3235.80] P:1889.62 E:0.035167 |  after never having come to the match at all tonight.
[3235.88 - 3238.04] P:1807.63 E:0.040210 |  I'm Mark Saga, this is five live sport.
[3238.04 - 3241.00] P:1963.34 E:0.037480 |  It's Manchester United won, Chelsea won at halftime.
[3241.00 - 3243.08] P:1770.52 E:0.034193 |  Stan Collimore alongside me.
[3243.08 - 3245.16] P:1637.52 E:0.037301 |  First of all, just a quick overall reflection.
[3245.16 - 3246.52] P:1944.77 E:0.041534 |  Then we'll go through those incidents
[3246.52 - 3248.44] P:1914.18 E:0.032293 |  and in the end there were many in that first half.
[3248.44 - 3251.00] P:1717.77 E:0.036307 |  Yeah, they didn't adapt quickly enough Chelsea for me.
[3251.00 - 3253.80] P:1614.08 E:0.036590 |  Claude McAleigh expecting, I think Manchester United
[3253.80 - 3257.16] P:1494.45 E:0.035790 |  to play a 4-3-3 with him set as the deep midfield
[3257.16 - 3262.68] P:1551.07 E:0.037934 |  to stop the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Tevez and Wayne Rooney as the three.
[3262.68 - 3266.04] P:1483.80 E:0.037864 |  As it turned out, United called the bluff, they went with,
[3266.04 - 3269.64] P:1534.89 E:0.032022 |  oh, in heart, grief, wide first wonderful tactical decision
[3269.64 - 3271.00] P:1652.05 E:0.038278 |  because if you can get up and down,
[3271.00 - 3273.80] P:1558.60 E:0.030431 |  you pen dashly cold back in his left-back position
[3273.80 - 3276.12] P:1506.25 E:0.037405 |  and Cristiano Ronaldo on that left.
[3276.12 - 3281.00] P:1542.59 E:0.031765 |  It effectively, Mark, made Claude McAleigh's position redundant.
[3281.00 - 3282.92] P:1726.46 E:0.039596 |  A lot of times through that first half,
[3282.92 - 3286.04] P:1782.66 E:0.035580 |  Chelsea had five against only Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.
[3286.04 - 3287.96] P:2047.60 E:0.040215 |  You nearly said it before the start of the game there
[3287.96 - 3290.84] P:1868.83 E:0.038884 |  because Chelsea were out late for their warm-up,
[3290.84 - 3292.28] P:1653.43 E:0.040207 |  whether that was deliberate or not.
[3292.28 - 3294.04] P:1767.69 E:0.035611 |  It made them look as if they weren't at the races
[3294.04 - 3296.44] P:1743.61 E:0.039395 |  and they weren't early on and, with Owen Hargreaves,
[3296.44 - 3300.20] P:1834.57 E:0.039318 |  a wide on the right, there was the tactical change from Fergie,
[3300.20 - 3301.88] P:1966.81 E:0.040386 |  learning so much from that league game
[3301.88 - 3303.80] P:1800.08 E:0.037006 |  when Chelsea battered them early on.
[3303.80 - 3305.56] P:1770.52 E:0.036157 |  There was never going to be that again today.
[3305.56 - 3308.04] P:1821.60 E:0.039269 |  Well, I expected Claude McAleigh as an experienced pro.
[3308.04 - 3310.12] P:1620.98 E:0.041574 |  Don't forget, he's been in an arena like this
[3310.12 - 3311.80] P:1667.02 E:0.032741 |  and he's won the Champions League.
[3311.80 - 3313.64] P:1527.86 E:0.044788 |  Once he realised that he wasn't going to have
[3314.52 - 3316.68] P:1528.70 E:0.035952 |  an attack in midfield or coming up against him,
[3316.68 - 3318.28] P:1739.13 E:0.038818 |  he should have pushed forward 10 yards
[3318.28 - 3320.60] P:1520.61 E:0.036659 |  to give the likes of Balak and Lampard,
[3320.60 - 3322.92] P:1593.78 E:0.034149 |  get them within touching distance, he did the age rugby.
[3322.92 - 3325.72] P:1516.76 E:0.038107 |  As it turned out, Lampard and Balak, for the most part,
[3325.72 - 3327.80] P:1542.83 E:0.036880 |  were a good 40 or 50 yards away
[3327.80 - 3330.12] P:1642.52 E:0.035325 |  and Chelsea just couldn't get out of their own half.
[3330.76 - 3332.44] P:1903.70 E:0.045509 |  What only much happened to Starwood, did it?
[3333.08 - 3336.12] P:1672.33 E:0.039960 |  No, not at all and it was very, very scrappy,
[3336.12 - 3337.56] P:1742.95 E:0.035525 |  but you just thought that United,
[3337.56 - 3339.24] P:1514.31 E:0.038466 |  they had better ball retention,
[3339.24 - 3341.32] P:1555.20 E:0.034744 |  they got the ball into those wide positions
[3341.32 - 3343.64] P:1439.70 E:0.035819 |  and Wes Brown, once he received the ball back
[3344.28 - 3346.76] P:1617.19 E:0.034400 |  from Owen Hargreaves, I think it was,
[3346.76 - 3349.48] P:1500.23 E:0.034852 |  putting a delightful left footed in swinging cross
[3349.48 - 3350.36] P:1655.05 E:0.046078 |  to the far post.
[3350.92 - 3354.44] P:1756.24 E:0.037371 |  Cristiano Ronaldo, yes, is very tricky with the ball at his feet,
[3354.44 - 3357.16] P:1780.46 E:0.037046 |  for his 6'1", 6'2", and very good in the air
[3357.16 - 3358.84] P:1507.75 E:0.035302 |  and caught Michael Essian napping.
[3358.84 - 3360.44] P:1773.77 E:0.045378 |  Yeah, what a header that was as well.
[3360.44 - 3363.48] P:1771.73 E:0.039292 |  I mean, he pierced the goal, the Chelsea goal
[3363.48 - 3364.92] P:1611.87 E:0.036664 |  and Czech was nowhere.
[3364.92 - 3366.84] P:1831.66 E:0.041535 |  The Scholes incident was vital as well,
[3366.84 - 3369.24] P:1800.90 E:0.039511 |  that really brought the game to life there.
[3369.24 - 3372.44] P:1802.67 E:0.037880 |  He got a bloody nose for his clash there with McAlelly,
[3372.44 - 3375.16] P:1711.40 E:0.037802 |  they both were the first two yellow cards of the game.
[3375.16 - 3377.56] P:1779.38 E:0.037962 |  Scholes, you know, he could do that every now and again
[3377.64 - 3379.80] P:1907.28 E:0.037474 |  and then you just suddenly found there was a real edge
[3379.80 - 3380.44] P:1988.51 E:0.036835 |  about the game.
[3380.44 - 3382.12] P:1631.32 E:0.031130 |  Yeah, I think that United basically,
[3382.12 - 3383.56] P:1855.53 E:0.041249 |  two against two in midfield,
[3383.56 - 3387.00] P:1523.24 E:0.035167 |  we were a little bit worried prior to the game
[3387.00 - 3389.96] P:1728.09 E:0.036792 |  whether Chelsea, with that three in midfield,
[3389.96 - 3393.08] P:1505.94 E:0.038580 |  might dominate, put the likes of Paul Scholes and Michael Karik,
[3393.08 - 3394.76] P:1817.15 E:0.040499 |  but actually it's been the other way around.
[3394.76 - 3396.44] P:1674.34 E:0.032749 |  Scholes and Karik have found themselves
[3396.44 - 3399.00] P:1703.54 E:0.031009 |  more often than not in very advanced positions
[3399.00 - 3403.00] P:1781.31 E:0.036513 |  and even when that 50-50 ball, McAlelly and Scholes,
[3403.00 - 3404.60] P:1776.40 E:0.036768 |  it was deep into Chelsea's half.
[3405.32 - 3407.88] P:2027.12 E:0.040128 |  Classic English football there in the counter attack
[3407.88 - 3409.24] P:2042.82 E:0.035331 |  from Manchester United.
[3409.24 - 3411.64] P:1971.07 E:0.039153 |  After what looked as if it was going to be a complete mess up
[3411.64 - 3414.76] P:2028.79 E:0.038968 |  in the United penalty, under no sort of pressure,
[3414.76 - 3417.48] P:1929.39 E:0.035166 |  and then van der Sar had to make a terrific save in the end
[3417.48 - 3419.40] P:1985.70 E:0.039069 |  from Balak's pressure on Rio Ferdinand.
[3419.40 - 3421.80] P:2045.09 E:0.035878 |  It was Ferdinand whose header was goal-bound,
[3421.80 - 3424.04] P:1925.73 E:0.032170 |  it was going to be an own goal, there's no doubt about that.
[3424.04 - 3427.00] P:1807.00 E:0.036767 |  Yeah, it was a wonderful ball diagonal outside the box
[3427.00 - 3428.92] P:1867.70 E:0.033295 |  to do the old drug route,
[3428.92 - 3430.76] P:1886.42 E:0.038116 |  for the first time really got into the game,
[3430.76 - 3433.00] P:1715.53 E:0.039046 |  not in the ball back and it was just under that pressure,
[3433.00 - 3434.68] P:1461.20 E:0.038309 |  like you say, from Michael Balak,
[3434.68 - 3436.44] P:1672.23 E:0.040785 |  came off Rio Ferdinand's forehead
[3436.44 - 3437.80] P:1267.06 E:0.032664 |  and that would have been an own goal.
[3437.80 - 3440.04] P:1809.83 E:0.029254 |  Rooney burst salad defence,
[3440.04 - 3443.16] P:1723.03 E:0.037148 |  just hits an arrow past to Ronaldo,
[3443.16 - 3444.36] P:1801.97 E:0.036600 |  whose pace and confidence,
[3444.36 - 3446.44] P:1843.71 E:0.033991 |  you had to have the pace and confidence of Ronaldo
[3446.44 - 3449.24] P:1950.74 E:0.035102 |  to fetch it and then do what he did with it
[3449.24 - 3450.84] P:1879.64 E:0.033488 |  and two saves from Petticec.
[3450.84 - 3452.60] P:1754.10 E:0.040368 |  We highlighted both goalkeepers,
[3452.60 - 3454.28] P:1774.31 E:0.038524 |  they both showed us exactly why
[3454.28 - 3456.20] P:1930.93 E:0.037361 |  they're as vital as strikers in a game like this.
[3456.20 - 3457.88] P:1679.72 E:0.041525 |  It came from Ricardo Corvalho,
[3457.88 - 3459.72] P:1857.37 E:0.040248 |  he tried to get up as John Terry did
[3459.72 - 3462.68] P:1849.26 E:0.036720 |  once or twice in midway through the half.
[3462.68 - 3464.92] P:1816.65 E:0.040034 |  It gave the ball away just on the right-hand side
[3464.92 - 3468.04] P:1776.83 E:0.036378 |  and Wayne Rooney ran what, fully 50 or 60 yards,
[3468.04 - 3470.12] P:1699.18 E:0.034946 |  got to the halfway line, picked his head up
[3470.12 - 3473.08] P:1678.45 E:0.040167 |  and he saw Cristiano Ronaldo making that wonderful run
[3473.08 - 3475.32] P:1762.73 E:0.037241 |  out to the left-hand side of the 18-yard box.
[3475.32 - 3478.28] P:1778.37 E:0.036045 |  It took one touch to the Portuguese, whipped it hard and low
[3478.28 - 3479.72] P:1570.91 E:0.037057 |  and you thought that was it, goal.
[3479.72 - 3481.24] P:1970.49 E:0.036917 |  Petticec stood up ever so well,
[3481.24 - 3485.08] P:1785.23 E:0.033660 |  Ella Peter Schmeichel in his heyday, ball came back out,
[3485.08 - 3487.56] P:1741.27 E:0.027129 |  Michael carried everything technically well
[3487.56 - 3489.56] P:1755.98 E:0.034767 |  from a midfielders point of view,
[3489.56 - 3492.20] P:1825.55 E:0.029571 |  he didn't panic, he side-footed it with pace,
[3492.20 - 3494.28] P:1696.00 E:0.035262 |  another good save from Petticec, kept them in the game.
[3494.28 - 3495.96] P:1923.93 E:0.043637 |  Talk about the stories as well Stan,
[3495.96 - 3497.24] P:2044.07 E:0.043261 |  I mean the early one was Ronaldo,
[3497.24 - 3499.80] P:1930.29 E:0.042555 |  would he be able to crack it on the biggest stage of all?
[3499.80 - 3502.36] P:1932.74 E:0.034044 |  Yes, Frank Lampard, would he be able to come back?
[3502.36 - 3504.76] P:1970.34 E:0.036374 |  Would the emotion of what's happened to his family
[3504.76 - 3506.44] P:1831.72 E:0.037341 |  and everything else get the better of him
[3506.44 - 3508.76] P:1894.88 E:0.039975 |  as all sorts of talk about whether he's even going to be
[3508.76 - 3510.12] P:2075.02 E:0.033114 |  at Chelsea next season?
[3510.12 - 3513.40] P:1807.46 E:0.040745 |  Yes he would, with that equaliser out of the blue,
[3513.40 - 3514.52] P:1850.20 E:0.033824 |  if I could put it that way,
[3514.52 - 3518.04] P:1931.43 E:0.034908 |  but that's exactly what Chelsea do to all sorts of teams
[3518.04 - 3519.64] P:1925.61 E:0.035934 |  at week in, week out in the Premier League.
[3519.64 - 3520.84] P:1809.85 E:0.039656 |  They look down and out,
[3520.84 - 3523.72] P:1995.56 E:0.032411 |  but they somehow fiddled something and get back in ball.
[3523.72 - 3525.72] P:1813.48 E:0.037839 |  And for the first time for two or three minutes,
[3525.72 - 3529.08] P:1868.04 E:0.039253 |  Michael Essie had just managed to get to the wards of the half-way line,
[3529.08 - 3532.36] P:1686.64 E:0.037772 |  having been penned back into his half by Cristiano Ronaldo,
[3532.36 - 3534.92] P:1646.29 E:0.036422 |  he managed to get well into the United half,
[3534.92 - 3537.88] P:1886.91 E:0.032938 |  got the shot off, two deflections, came to Frank Lampard,
[3537.88 - 3539.72] P:1861.23 E:0.034597 |  it was a gift for him to accept that.
[3539.72 - 3541.80] P:2051.06 E:0.041359 |  One-one-and-half time if you're just joining us here tonight
[3541.80 - 3542.92] P:1998.85 E:0.037671 |  on Five Lives Sport,
[3542.92 - 3546.52] P:1824.35 E:0.036882 |  Chelsea with that late equaliser from Frank Lampard,
[3546.52 - 3548.84] P:1635.19 E:0.042354 |  what's it like in West London outside Stamford Bridge?
[3548.84 - 3553.56] P:1584.26 E:0.040736 |  I swear to goodness you would have been in one already,
[3553.56 - 3557.32] P:1335.09 E:0.049926 |  there's absolutely loads and loads of people just poured on this train.
[3557.32 - 3557.96] P:1511.38 E:0.038693 |  You're looking at the game!
[3557.96 - 3559.40] P:1618.60 E:0.040271 |  Michael, how are you feeling?
[3559.40 - 3562.44] P:1616.79 E:0.039650 |  Oh, we are absolutely fantastic here,
[3562.44 - 3566.84] P:1357.11 E:0.039864 |  it's brilliant, safe by safe by Lampard, what a goal!
[3566.84 - 3571.96] P:1632.09 E:0.039248 |  Because you really, really don't, we are absolutely over the moon,
[3571.96 - 3575.64] P:1707.98 E:0.034957 |  we are celebrating, we are going to win this round.
[3575.64 - 3578.20] P:1566.93 E:0.036337 |  You've got 45 minutes left though.
[3578.20 - 3581.40] P:1664.09 E:0.041718 |  We are going to trouse it now, we have got them.
[3581.40 - 3583.08] P:1349.75 E:0.047865 |  Chelsea, we're going to win this easily.
[3583.08 - 3584.28] P:1822.80 E:0.045599 |  We are going to win.
[3584.28 - 3587.08] P:1521.71 E:0.043073 |  Well, we just think they've won already,
[3587.08 - 3588.76] P:1593.96 E:0.035136 |  I swear to goodness, what a man!
[3588.76 - 3590.76] P:1596.89 E:0.045794 |  Oh, Chelsea!
[3592.76 - 3595.56] P:1499.49 E:0.045576 |  They're really going for it there in West London,
[3595.56 - 3596.76] P:1647.21 E:0.042402 |  what about an old Trafford,
[3596.76 - 3599.00] P:1930.12 E:0.036110 |  Nick Garnett's in the closest pub to the ground.
[3599.80 - 3601.48] P:1752.67 E:0.042319 |  It's very, very quiet here now,
[3601.48 - 3603.72] P:1703.24 E:0.039139 |  it all went very, very quiet just in the last minute,
[3603.72 - 3604.92] P:1919.87 E:0.032334 |  and with Emma and Sean,
[3604.92 - 3607.24] P:1602.59 E:0.029322 |  how do you feel now that that goal's gone in?
[3607.24 - 3609.16] P:1695.97 E:0.031750 |  Really positive still, because we're the better team,
[3609.16 - 3611.96] P:1647.23 E:0.036521 |  we had all the chances, they had one fluky goal at the end,
[3611.96 - 3613.56] P:1362.27 E:0.032158 |  and we're going to win it still, no problem.
[3613.56 - 3616.28] P:1546.39 E:0.045690 |  Ronaldo, Rooney, Giggs is going to come on,
[3616.28 - 3617.40] P:1518.69 E:0.032424 |  because he's my favourite player,
[3617.40 - 3619.16] P:1483.52 E:0.033456 |  Giggs is going to come on and score a winning goal.
[3619.16 - 3623.08] P:1666.66 E:0.038633 |  Sean, they had all that possession in the beginning of the first half,
[3623.08 - 3626.04] P:1383.25 E:0.031523 |  and they got no over that goal, why did it all out?
[3626.04 - 3629.08] P:1319.34 E:0.036075 |  Not really, because Chelsea haven't been a bit of a team by far,
[3629.08 - 3631.24] P:1442.62 E:0.033334 |  they've not been up to scrap, it's not played good.
[3631.24 - 3633.24] P:1666.97 E:0.040543 |  And you reckon that you'll be able to do it in the second half?
[3633.24 - 3635.00] P:1077.01 E:0.035993 |  3-1, we scored a lot of United.
[3635.00 - 3636.68] P:1850.46 E:0.048799 |  Well, there you go, 3-1 from here,
[3636.68 - 3639.00] P:1396.62 E:0.026472 |  that's the score from the day, say that it's going to be.
[3639.00 - 3641.48] P:1886.78 E:0.034105 |  Belief from Manchester United fans,
[3641.48 - 3644.84] P:1866.09 E:0.038593 |  and belief from Fergie, it may well be his tactical now,
[3644.84 - 3646.20] P:1622.04 E:0.036245 |  so against the better of Avram Graf,
[3646.20 - 3647.32] P:1534.51 E:0.040462 |  we'll talk more on that in a moment,
[3647.32 - 3650.60] P:1931.36 E:0.027096 |  just to tell you though that Giggs and Anderson and Nani
[3650.60 - 3653.24] P:1962.29 E:0.033032 |  are among the substitutes from Manchester United,
[3653.24 - 3655.32] P:1918.30 E:0.030529 |  out on the pitch at half time,
[3655.32 - 3658.84] P:2030.32 E:0.030619 |  no sign of any Chelsea thoughts at all.
[3658.84 - 3662.44] P:1971.58 E:0.034936 |  0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3, is the number to ring tonight,
[3662.44 - 3665.24] P:2005.83 E:0.033926 |  6-0-6 with Alan Green following the conclusion
[3665.24 - 3666.92] P:1966.26 E:0.027413 |  of the Champions League final.
[3666.92 - 3669.00] P:1843.40 E:0.034512 |  You can email him via the Five Live website,
[3669.00 - 3672.28] P:1908.19 E:0.032914 |  or text Alan as well, 85058.
[3672.28 - 3674.84] P:2040.99 E:0.037866 |  We're back where we started, Manchester United won,
[3674.84 - 3677.80] P:1923.18 E:0.031916 |  Chelsea won at half time, full second half commentary to come,
[3677.80 - 3679.40] P:1787.97 E:0.035261 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3687.96 - 3689.08] P:1847.88 E:0.047587 |  Half time, Manchester United won,
[3689.08 - 3691.00] P:1850.58 E:0.040713 |  Chelsea won Ronaldo with a terrific header
[3691.00 - 3693.88] P:1881.36 E:0.037250 |  from Manchester United, Chelsea really against the run of play,
[3693.88 - 3695.96] P:1715.02 E:0.034925 |  back in it through Frank Lampard, just very quickly,
[3695.96 - 3697.88] P:1737.19 E:0.037248 |  we haven't really mentioned the pitch there, you know,
[3697.88 - 3700.44] P:1997.25 E:0.035015 |  van der Sar slipped, he was in two minds possibly,
[3700.44 - 3702.36] P:1755.93 E:0.037371 |  but his feet went from under him, you know.
[3702.36 - 3703.80] P:1587.02 E:0.038801 |  Yeah, but looking around the box,
[3703.80 - 3704.60] P:1717.71 E:0.035415 |  I think that that would have happened,
[3704.60 - 3705.96] P:1927.89 E:0.027050 |  that was just because it's wet,
[3705.96 - 3708.44] P:1728.65 E:0.040762 |  certainly looking around, the surface looks quite well,
[3708.44 - 3710.20] P:1694.15 E:0.034251 |  and is bearing up considering.
[3710.20 - 3711.96] P:2046.02 E:0.036763 |  Stick or twist, you said, stick or twist,
[3711.96 - 3714.20] P:1910.90 E:0.036287 |  what do the two managers do for the second half?
[3714.20 - 3715.72] P:1724.53 E:0.041384 |  I think for United keep it as it is,
[3715.72 - 3720.28] P:1905.93 E:0.034663 |  I think it's Chelsea that have got the tailoring to United system,
[3720.28 - 3722.60] P:1851.41 E:0.035486 |  I think that they've completely came out of the blocks,
[3722.60 - 3725.00] P:1749.44 E:0.037111 |  and bamboozled Chelsea, like I said,
[3725.00 - 3727.72] P:1826.12 E:0.034417 |  keep going back to this point, but it's so, so relevant,
[3727.72 - 3730.28] P:1697.90 E:0.039115 |  Claude McAleely's job at the moment is redundant,
[3730.28 - 3731.56] P:1871.71 E:0.040407 |  so what do Chelsea do?
[3731.56 - 3735.56] P:1578.25 E:0.036035 |  They put another one up front and try and wrestle back
[3735.56 - 3738.20] P:1641.20 E:0.037617 |  some kind of possession, or stick Solomon Kalu
[3738.20 - 3740.84] P:1533.92 E:0.036375 |  on for McAleely in addition to midfield players.
[3740.84 - 3742.12] P:1784.49 E:0.047267 |  Stan, they're all into the game now,
[3742.12 - 3743.64] P:1883.41 E:0.040638 |  you must have come off big games
[3743.64 - 3745.64] P:1735.48 E:0.039170 |  when you've been battered like that in the first half,
[3745.64 - 3746.92] P:1638.56 E:0.038730 |  and you've perhaps got a lucky break,
[3746.92 - 3749.00] P:1942.21 E:0.042699 |  will Chelsea at half time really come out now?
[3749.00 - 3750.68] P:2074.18 E:0.029704 |  Will we see a different Chelsea side
[3750.68 - 3752.44] P:1781.36 E:0.031610 |  because of what happened just before half time?
[3752.44 - 3755.96] P:1739.13 E:0.035992 |  I think so, because certainly for the first 30-35 minutes,
[3755.96 - 3757.16] P:1825.58 E:0.042654 |  it was all Manchester United,
[3757.16 - 3758.76] P:1951.32 E:0.045964 |  it was interesting towards the end of the half
[3758.76 - 3761.72] P:1767.82 E:0.032861 |  that Cristiano Ronaldo faded a little bit,
[3761.72 - 3764.92] P:1712.52 E:0.034466 |  and certainly Michael Essian came more to the fore,
[3764.92 - 3767.32] P:1781.16 E:0.031476 |  but again, back to square one,
[3767.32 - 3769.00] P:1967.22 E:0.035762 |  will Chelsea keep their system the same?
[3769.00 - 3770.04] P:1528.12 E:0.027717 |  That for me is the big question.
[3770.04 - 3771.56] P:1988.35 E:0.045462 |  Do you think Avram Grant at the moment,
[3771.56 - 3773.88] P:1643.21 E:0.039631 |  we talk about lack of confidence for players on the big occasion,
[3773.88 - 3777.64] P:1944.27 E:0.034441 |  will Avram Grant have the confidence to change it if necessary?
[3777.64 - 3778.76] P:2011.76 E:0.039430 |  He didn't seem to do anything,
[3778.76 - 3780.68] P:2008.05 E:0.031969 |  he nearly froze again after Manchester United
[3780.68 - 3782.44] P:1910.52 E:0.032912 |  took the lead there, looking at the bench.
[3782.44 - 3783.96] P:1782.82 E:0.038597 |  Well, I think you give the responsibility
[3783.96 - 3784.92] P:1574.43 E:0.033332 |  to the players on the pitch,
[3784.92 - 3785.88] P:1907.85 E:0.038942 |  and I know that, like I say,
[3785.88 - 3788.28] P:1563.95 E:0.038886 |  Claude McAleely is a defensive midfield player,
[3788.28 - 3791.40] P:1689.68 E:0.041954 |  but the fact that he was only two or three yards at any one moment
[3792.12 - 3794.52] P:1583.26 E:0.038049 |  from Carve Alliol and John Terry,
[3794.52 - 3797.40] P:1887.83 E:0.039692 |  he as an experienced player needs to address the situation,
[3797.40 - 3798.92] P:1888.61 E:0.032032 |  assess the situation and say,
[3798.92 - 3801.00] P:1516.86 E:0.041038 |  I actually don't need to mark anybody here,
[3801.00 - 3804.44] P:1479.86 E:0.040349 |  the two central defenders are marking Rune and Tevez,
[3804.44 - 3806.12] P:1759.10 E:0.032657 |  I can push forward 15 yards.
[3806.20 - 3809.48] P:1813.72 E:0.044661 |  It was Ronaldo put Manchester United ahead of thoroughly deserved lead,
[3809.48 - 3811.72] P:1862.63 E:0.033809 |  it was Frank Lampard that got Chelsea back into it.
[3811.72 - 3813.08] P:1998.35 E:0.043772 |  What are we going to see at the second half
[3813.08 - 3815.24] P:1995.70 E:0.036856 |  of the Champions League final here in Moscow?
[3815.24 - 3818.68] P:1921.55 E:0.037290 |  Let's find out right now once more with Alan Green.
[3820.20 - 3822.92] P:1702.19 E:0.032068 |  Well, absolutely nothing to commentate on
[3822.92 - 3824.92] P:1752.68 E:0.039504 |  in the first 22 and a half minutes of the game,
[3825.96 - 3827.56] P:1786.75 E:0.039943 |  little of any consequence whatsoever,
[3827.56 - 3830.92] P:1801.89 E:0.035985 |  and then it all burst alike with Ronaldo's goal,
[3830.92 - 3834.12] P:1832.59 E:0.031795 |  that frankly it was the result of a good header
[3834.12 - 3836.76] P:1905.38 E:0.031460 |  with some shoddy defending by Chelsea,
[3836.76 - 3838.20] P:1894.10 E:0.036460 |  Esi and Tupi flat footed,
[3838.92 - 3841.88] P:1979.18 E:0.037472 |  and really Manchester United should be out of sight.
[3842.68 - 3844.92] P:1934.33 E:0.035060 |  The great double save by Czech,
[3844.92 - 3848.12] P:1835.79 E:0.033116 |  but maybe United through Tevez and character of Madrid,
[3848.12 - 3850.60] P:1671.14 E:0.034021 |  didn't get his body or his hand to the ball,
[3850.60 - 3852.68] P:1715.62 E:0.032889 |  and then the great cross by Rune,
[3852.68 - 3854.68] P:1680.81 E:0.030190 |  that I thought Tevez was going to tuck in as well,
[3854.68 - 3859.72] P:1691.80 E:0.028333 |  but he didn't, so Chelsea are very, very fortunate
[3859.72 - 3862.60] P:1577.35 E:0.029798 |  to be level at the start of the second half.
[3862.60 - 3866.76] P:1471.42 E:0.034546 |  I wonder Graham, would you be tempted to just take off Machalely,
[3867.40 - 3871.40] P:1556.32 E:0.032928 |  put on Belletti at right back and move Esi into midfield?
[3872.04 - 3873.80] P:1650.55 E:0.033599 |  I think the thing is when you're looking at that,
[3873.80 - 3876.12] P:1775.61 E:0.034728 |  you look at that first half and you say,
[3876.12 - 3878.84] P:1446.31 E:0.028072 |  listen, we haven't played here, we haven't performed,
[3878.84 - 3884.20] P:1667.00 E:0.034511 |  and listening to what is being said from Stan saying about Machalely,
[3884.20 - 3886.76] P:1505.85 E:0.041827 |  I think what you do now, you've got that goal
[3887.48 - 3890.28] P:1765.78 E:0.030226 |  that suddenly brings you right back into the game.
[3891.24 - 3894.68] P:1803.39 E:0.037966 |  So in one respect, let's have a look for 10 to 15 minutes,
[3894.68 - 3897.96] P:1734.05 E:0.035484 |  and let's see if that goal has such a positive effect on us,
[3897.96 - 3901.24] P:1570.34 E:0.042373 |  and we can then get ourselves really in control of the game.
[3901.24 - 3904.28] P:1828.47 E:0.025796 |  If it doesn't, then he has to make changes.
[3904.28 - 3907.96] P:1705.76 E:0.038239 |  Well, Manchester United are out very early for the start of the second half,
[3907.96 - 3911.64] P:1630.93 E:0.034429 |  there are no changes in their 11, nor would you expect a change.
[3911.64 - 3916.28] P:1463.05 E:0.034901 |  goalkeepers van Dizar, defenders Brian, Ferdinand, Vittic and Evra,
[3916.36 - 3920.04] P:1577.67 E:0.037111 |  we can be certain that the midfield is Hargreaves on the right,
[3920.04 - 3922.60] P:1438.42 E:0.035079 |  Ronaldo on the left, Scoleson carry between them,
[3922.60 - 3925.00] P:1322.22 E:0.032290 |  and up front, Rooney and Tevez.
[3925.00 - 3928.52] P:1668.22 E:0.034812 |  I wonder if this is just a little bit of sneaky thinking by Chelsea.
[3928.52 - 3930.12] P:1816.98 E:0.035898 |  Make United wait.
[3930.12 - 3934.28] P:1928.83 E:0.029069 |  Finally, Maluda comes out onto the pitch.
[3935.24 - 3938.76] P:1879.60 E:0.035501 |  He hasn't done a great deal for me, but Chelsea,
[3938.76 - 3940.36] P:1809.46 E:0.044849 |  as a whole, haven't done a great deal.
[3940.36 - 3943.96] P:1802.73 E:0.036734 |  They have to play better surely in the second half than they did in the first,
[3944.04 - 3947.40] P:1887.70 E:0.034123 |  and we're assuming that they're not going to make any changes as yet.
[3947.40 - 3953.40] P:1832.75 E:0.031981 |  The goalkeeper is Czech, defensive, Eson, Carvalho, Terry, and Ashley Cole,
[3953.40 - 3956.52] P:1460.21 E:0.039119 |  a midfielder, McAlele, Balak and Lampard,
[3956.52 - 3960.84] P:1610.15 E:0.033935 |  then Jocall and Maluda, and finally, Drogba.
[3960.84 - 3965.24] P:1823.01 E:0.033060 |  It's also important, Graham, there are four changes, four changes.
[3966.68 - 3971.32] P:1860.54 E:0.028867 |  Sir Alex Ferguson actually came out behind Drogba,
[3971.32 - 3974.60] P:1710.99 E:0.035579 |  and I think there may have been words from the United boss there about,
[3974.60 - 3976.04] P:1859.06 E:0.042154 |  you know, why are you so late?
[3977.56 - 3978.76] P:1763.27 E:0.020664 |  What do you think, Graham?
[3978.76 - 3982.36] P:1710.12 E:0.038790 |  Yeah, I mean, at the end, the referee will have called them out.
[3982.36 - 3985.32] P:1832.98 E:0.036641 |  The referee will have been in charge of those kind of situation.
[3985.32 - 3987.56] P:1488.13 E:0.033566 |  It may be that he's brought them out of the dressing room.
[3987.56 - 3989.96] P:1777.34 E:0.035759 |  I'm not certain we haven't seen inside there.
[3989.96 - 3994.92] P:1759.72 E:0.035200 |  My whole particular feeling about this is that goal, just before half-time,
[3994.92 - 3997.08] P:1805.33 E:0.036505 |  are we going to see a change of effect?
[3997.08 - 3998.20] P:1738.64 E:0.043126 |  We just have to wait and see.
[3998.20 - 4001.00] P:1736.06 E:0.043583 |  I should tell you, four players were yellow-carded in the first half,
[4001.48 - 4003.80] P:1885.13 E:0.034435 |  Thurdenand and Scholes from Manchester United,
[4003.80 - 4007.96] P:1802.98 E:0.034444 |  Carvalho and McAlele for Chelsea, and there were some techy moments.
[4007.96 - 4011.08] P:1787.82 E:0.039705 |  This referee will not be frightened to send somebody off.
[4011.08 - 4012.60] P:1678.49 E:0.034498 |  The second half is underway.
[4012.60 - 4015.40] P:1708.37 E:0.041356 |  Chelsea all in blue, defending the end to our left,
[4015.96 - 4018.04] P:1616.82 E:0.035668 |  behind which are the Manchester United fans.
[4018.92 - 4021.08] P:1607.37 E:0.035880 |  It's cluttered upfield by Chelsea.
[4021.08 - 4025.40] P:1498.73 E:0.039766 |  Brilliant chest down by Drogba, but Maluda, who's had a poor game,
[4025.40 - 4027.88] P:1444.15 E:0.028857 |  just bollies the ball high over the crossbar.
[4027.88 - 4028.92] P:1463.61 E:0.033451 |  That was hopeful, wasn't it?
[4029.00 - 4030.36] P:1494.19 E:0.035979 |  He was hitting hope there.
[4030.36 - 4031.32] P:1292.57 E:0.042283 |  It's knocked down to him.
[4031.32 - 4033.00] P:1446.87 E:0.041234 |  He's had a swing at it with his right foot.
[4033.96 - 4035.32] P:1400.19 E:0.049784 |  He's never going to score from there.
[4035.32 - 4037.96] P:1478.74 E:0.040434 |  What I also think is Chelsea have got to get into the game
[4037.96 - 4041.40] P:1536.86 E:0.041171 |  to be able to bring Cole, Joe Cole in particular.
[4041.40 - 4042.52] P:1621.59 E:0.042423 |  It's hardly had a kick.
[4042.52 - 4043.80] P:1195.70 E:0.035317 |  Hardly had a touch of the ball.
[4043.80 - 4044.92] P:1253.00 E:0.038337 |  No involvement.
[4044.92 - 4047.96] P:1413.42 E:0.037132 |  Terry had the ball forward, intercepted by Carrick.
[4047.96 - 4049.72] P:1321.95 E:0.038992 |  And here's Brown in the far side of the field.
[4049.72 - 4051.32] P:1649.19 E:0.036841 |  Maluda's foot was high.
[4051.96 - 4053.00] P:1410.22 E:0.033757 |  And is that a free kick?
[4053.00 - 4054.04] P:1542.15 E:0.036904 |  I think it is a free kick.
[4054.04 - 4057.08] P:1451.94 E:0.034680 |  But a foot in from the right touch line, almost on the halfway line.
[4057.08 - 4060.04] P:1364.56 E:0.026598 |  He played to Scholes and back to Ferdinand.
[4060.04 - 4060.92] P:1469.83 E:0.040806 |  And here's Vittic.
[4061.72 - 4063.64] P:1541.40 E:0.033961 |  Vittic from Manchester United.
[4063.64 - 4064.84] P:1425.07 E:0.040846 |  Tereo Ferdinand.
[4064.84 - 4068.20] P:1511.15 E:0.039350 |  And there were two deflections on the way to Lampard's goal.
[4068.20 - 4069.80] P:1484.55 E:0.039321 |  One of them certainly came off Ferdinand.
[4070.68 - 4072.12] P:1540.31 E:0.042543 |  Ferdinand leaves at Neyford's goal,
[4072.12 - 4073.80] P:1404.85 E:0.038399 |  inside the centre circle.
[4073.80 - 4076.36] P:1537.73 E:0.039718 |  First minute on the second half has been played.
[4076.36 - 4080.04] P:1603.98 E:0.037121 |  You listen to BBC radio, Manchester United won,
[4080.04 - 4082.68] P:1553.42 E:0.026632 |  Chelsea won, Evra into Tevez.
[4082.68 - 4084.04] P:1368.80 E:0.040282 |  Back towards Evra.
[4084.04 - 4087.00] P:1521.71 E:0.035512 |  But another example of how this surface is not clever
[4087.00 - 4090.04] P:1536.57 E:0.031525 |  Evra slipped and checkmixed the clearance to the half where he line.
[4090.04 - 4091.00] P:1607.62 E:0.034786 |  Scholes heads it back.
[4091.00 - 4095.64] P:1467.20 E:0.035920 |  Here's Ronaldo, who was caught quite badly by Cavalio late in the first half.
[4097.00 - 4098.52] P:1533.52 E:0.042805 |  Here's Wes Bryant.
[4099.16 - 4103.56] P:1464.12 E:0.036306 |  Hargreaves, who certainly had a very influential first 45 minutes.
[4103.56 - 4105.80] P:1665.63 E:0.034679 |  Maluda barged in soon then.
[4105.80 - 4107.48] P:1613.85 E:0.034490 |  The referee's quite right, Louis Miquel.
[4107.48 - 4109.96] P:1772.22 E:0.034294 |  That's a free kick to Manchester United.
[4110.92 - 4115.40] P:1616.85 E:0.036749 |  You know, I look at Maluda and I cannot understand why his feet was justified.
[4115.40 - 4117.48] P:1470.42 E:0.033862 |  I do not understand what he's doing in the team.
[4117.48 - 4122.36] P:1337.04 E:0.038915 |  I have to say, I think he's been a big disappointment in terms of his performances.
[4122.36 - 4124.28] P:1481.64 E:0.039689 |  They've been very, very inconsistent.
[4125.56 - 4127.00] P:1522.23 E:0.043267 |  Free kick taken by United.
[4127.00 - 4129.00] P:1442.48 E:0.036506 |  Here's Ferdinand on to Vidditch.
[4130.20 - 4131.88] P:1649.55 E:0.043565 |  Quite a slow start to the second half.
[4131.88 - 4133.32] P:1531.80 E:0.035837 |  Oh, poor from Vidditch.
[4133.32 - 4135.88] P:1643.52 E:0.034910 |  And then Scholes was caught by Drogba.
[4137.08 - 4138.92] P:1528.98 E:0.037782 |  And if Drogba hadn't done that,
[4138.92 - 4140.76] P:1642.70 E:0.034631 |  Chelsea would have a great position to counterattack.
[4142.20 - 4144.84] P:1614.08 E:0.040755 |  Anyway, Scholes is going to take the free kick himself.
[4144.84 - 4146.52] P:1615.96 E:0.033377 |  And pedestrian started the second half.
[4147.24 - 4149.48] P:1679.20 E:0.036796 |  Scholes, hit the free kick to the left side.
[4149.48 - 4151.24] P:1576.31 E:0.034030 |  And Evra into Ronaldo.
[4151.24 - 4152.68] P:1515.48 E:0.035050 |  Lampard's close by.
[4152.68 - 4155.16] P:1506.83 E:0.034907 |  Neat backfield by Ronaldo to Evra.
[4155.16 - 4156.04] P:1597.77 E:0.036532 |  And it's Scholes.
[4156.04 - 4158.60] P:1567.18 E:0.038561 |  Scholes looking for the run forward of Hargreaves.
[4158.60 - 4160.04] P:1353.73 E:0.041077 |  Hargreaves almost got to the fourth.
[4160.04 - 4162.68] P:1564.65 E:0.038521 |  Ashley Cole was under pressure but heads it away.
[4162.68 - 4166.68] P:1601.16 E:0.036772 |  And Cole snaps the clearance over the halfway line into the United half.
[4166.68 - 4168.60] P:1590.17 E:0.036590 |  Where it's met by Rio Ferdinand.
[4169.32 - 4173.40] P:1495.43 E:0.035950 |  Lots of empty red seats by quote executives in the far side of the field.
[4173.40 - 4175.08] P:1585.52 E:0.040452 |  We see that too often in England, don't we?
[4175.08 - 4178.68] P:1489.90 E:0.033715 |  But they're the UEFA cats who lick the cream.
[4179.80 - 4182.12] P:1422.06 E:0.038887 |  Balls out of play in the far side of the field.
[4182.12 - 4185.72] P:1570.41 E:0.042957 |  I mean, very interesting how quickly this game just settled down.
[4185.72 - 4187.48] P:1567.15 E:0.034658 |  It hasn't in the second half.
[4187.48 - 4187.80] P:1252.22 E:0.029872 |  No.
[4187.80 - 4190.04] P:1613.86 E:0.038379 |  It's ready for Mike England's commentary, just like the first half.
[4190.84 - 4191.80] P:1724.74 E:0.037108 |  I'm just wasting my time.
[4191.80 - 4192.84] P:1340.08 E:0.043824 |  I should hand over to Mike.
[4194.12 - 4196.44] P:1634.61 E:0.043916 |  I'll set Blatter's here, the president of FIFA.
[4197.64 - 4201.64] P:1549.85 E:0.038169 |  And Michel Pratini, of course, the president of UEFA.
[4201.64 - 4207.40] P:1621.80 E:0.035409 |  Such a great friend of English football, Michel Pratini, as he keeps on making his statements.
[4208.04 - 4209.80] P:1448.88 E:0.047021 |  Here's Lampard towards Romba.
[4209.80 - 4211.48] P:1603.95 E:0.035788 |  Good intercepted by Ferdinand.
[4211.48 - 4212.60] P:1554.85 E:0.036777 |  Ferdinand runs forward.
[4212.60 - 4213.80] P:1522.04 E:0.036311 |  Fines Ronaldo with a pass.
[4213.80 - 4216.36] P:1543.69 E:0.040993 |  Was awkward to the Portuguese and it's out of play.
[4216.92 - 4218.36] P:1479.50 E:0.048472 |  Which way is the throwing going?
[4218.36 - 4221.00] P:1734.85 E:0.038475 |  It's going to Ronaldo and Manchester United.
[4221.00 - 4222.44] P:1712.87 E:0.033537 |  Estian doesn't like the decision.
[4222.44 - 4227.40] P:1485.18 E:0.035177 |  And needlessly another ball boy throws a ball onto the playing surface.
[4227.40 - 4228.20] P:1762.08 E:0.036522 |  Throw in taken.
[4228.92 - 4230.84] P:1481.01 E:0.032018 |  Ronaldo back to Scholes.
[4231.40 - 4233.24] P:1662.05 E:0.037549 |  And Scholes carefully into Carrick.
[4233.80 - 4235.24] P:1509.84 E:0.038491 |  Carrick now to Hargreaves.
[4235.80 - 4238.20] P:1569.70 E:0.046209 |  Hargreaves and Rial to the best United players for me.
[4238.76 - 4239.80] P:1286.22 E:0.035951 |  Here's Bryant.
[4239.80 - 4240.76] P:1514.00 E:0.041171 |  Hargreaves again.
[4241.64 - 4243.72] P:1544.37 E:0.028761 |  And it's to Carrick once more.
[4243.72 - 4245.64] P:1517.80 E:0.040073 |  Four minutes already played in the second half.
[4247.00 - 4248.44] P:1389.53 E:0.039380 |  Not of any great import.
[4249.08 - 4250.52] P:1629.73 E:0.034890 |  Cavalho to Balak.
[4250.52 - 4253.24] P:1588.54 E:0.036231 |  Balak plays it in the direction of Maluda.
[4253.24 - 4254.76] P:1428.76 E:0.036699 |  But Ferdinand's there first.
[4254.76 - 4255.96] P:1533.89 E:0.035088 |  Easily, comfortably.
[4255.96 - 4257.56] P:1552.99 E:0.039962 |  Plays it back to Van Dazaar.
[4257.56 - 4258.92] P:1616.09 E:0.035224 |  Van Dazaar out to Carrick.
[4259.56 - 4262.36] P:1490.42 E:0.038947 |  Carrick now turns and runs away from Balak.
[4262.36 - 4263.72] P:1575.67 E:0.037580 |  Finds Paul Scholes.
[4264.28 - 4266.76] P:1563.44 E:0.038712 |  Scholes to the left side and Ronaldo.
[4266.76 - 4268.04] P:1357.53 E:0.034270 |  Ever the full back.
[4268.04 - 4269.64] P:1477.13 E:0.033824 |  Rushing past the Portuguese.
[4269.64 - 4272.04] P:1435.06 E:0.041530 |  And Ronaldo running forward in quite deliberately.
[4272.04 - 4272.52] P:1602.14 E:0.044804 |  Played it off.
[4272.52 - 4274.92] P:1725.45 E:0.037950 |  Jocall out of play for a throw into United.
[4275.88 - 4278.04] P:1537.73 E:0.031428 |  Ronaldo takes it back to Carrick.
[4279.56 - 4280.68] P:1508.99 E:0.040077 |  Scholes available.
[4280.68 - 4283.16] P:1559.42 E:0.044396 |  Carrick was plaited into there by Jocall.
[4283.16 - 4284.44] P:1429.44 E:0.044375 |  That could be another yellow card.
[4285.24 - 4288.12] P:1650.84 E:0.036883 |  And Jocall waves his hands as if I'm innocent.
[4288.12 - 4289.40] P:1564.09 E:0.032912 |  No you're not.
[4289.40 - 4290.20] P:1663.07 E:0.032245 |  It was late.
[4290.20 - 4291.72] P:1568.95 E:0.036999 |  It was a silly taffle wasn't it?
[4291.72 - 4292.84] P:1788.07 E:0.042803 |  There was no knee.
[4292.84 - 4294.84] P:1874.44 E:0.048598 |  It was always going to give a free kick away.
[4296.20 - 4298.12] P:1867.24 E:0.042657 |  Let's find that very difficult to understand.
[4298.12 - 4300.20] P:1689.90 E:0.031583 |  Because with Manchester United,
[4300.20 - 4303.00] P:1455.36 E:0.041942 |  now so was they can put the ball in the danger area.
[4303.00 - 4304.76] P:1593.19 E:0.043095 |  Free kick taken by Ronaldo to Evera.
[4304.76 - 4305.64] P:1423.57 E:0.040997 |  Back to Ronaldo.
[4305.64 - 4307.00] P:1573.62 E:0.039731 |  On to Evera again.
[4307.00 - 4310.36] P:1615.80 E:0.038928 |  And Balak pushes into Ronaldo.
[4310.36 - 4312.44] P:1547.97 E:0.038845 |  A bit of a dive by Ronaldo.
[4312.44 - 4315.96] P:1586.30 E:0.032769 |  He was fouled but he didn't need to make quite as much of it.
[4315.96 - 4317.56] P:1618.72 E:0.036675 |  Free kick has been awarded.
[4317.56 - 4319.16] P:1468.69 E:0.039056 |  Taken by Evera to Ronaldo.
[4319.16 - 4321.40] P:1644.59 E:0.032136 |  Ronaldo overhits the cross.
[4321.40 - 4322.92] P:1398.31 E:0.036749 |  One bounce in the fennel area.
[4322.92 - 4324.52] P:1550.37 E:0.034537 |  And behind it goes for a goal kick.
[4325.80 - 4328.84] P:1689.75 E:0.042337 |  It really is, you know, which direction you're coming from
[4328.84 - 4330.20] P:1270.68 E:0.043710 |  when you're looking at Ronaldo.
[4330.20 - 4331.16] P:1509.78 E:0.053687 |  Yes he does go down.
[4331.16 - 4333.64] P:1461.01 E:0.042435 |  He went down there probably unnecessarily.
[4333.64 - 4336.12] P:1484.39 E:0.045770 |  But I happen to believe having watched him, you know,
[4336.76 - 4340.76] P:1454.58 E:0.043974 |  a period of time now, he is in line to become a great player.
[4340.76 - 4342.52] P:1316.42 E:0.044819 |  That's all I'm going to say because the word great
[4342.52 - 4344.04] P:1448.33 E:0.025588 |  has to be used carefully.
[4344.04 - 4346.44] P:1518.31 E:0.036604 |  But he's certainly in line to become a great player.
[4346.44 - 4349.24] P:1599.30 E:0.045414 |  Maluda almost got on to that careless header by United.
[4349.24 - 4351.16] P:1594.61 E:0.038695 |  But it's cleared by those in red.
[4351.16 - 4352.04] P:1597.51 E:0.040561 |  Here's Droga.
[4353.32 - 4355.88] P:1551.03 E:0.044291 |  Not much influence in the game but that's a good ball forward
[4355.88 - 4356.68] P:1502.44 E:0.034993 |  to Lampard.
[4356.68 - 4357.56] P:1601.27 E:0.034303 |  Back to Droga.
[4357.56 - 4360.04] P:1471.13 E:0.039531 |  Droga appeals with a handball by Birx there.
[4360.04 - 4360.76] P:1511.14 E:0.033260 |  Not given.
[4360.76 - 4363.16] P:1708.66 E:0.037260 |  Hargreaves rushes away to the far side.
[4363.16 - 4365.32] P:1660.93 E:0.036522 |  They play to safety through United.
[4365.32 - 4366.68] P:1737.71 E:0.038053 |  At least he thought to safety.
[4366.68 - 4368.12] P:1743.20 E:0.040934 |  But it hit actually Cole.
[4368.12 - 4369.64] P:1538.80 E:0.040105 |  Rebounded under Hargreaves.
[4369.64 - 4370.76] P:1727.55 E:0.038241 |  And it goes for Chelsea.
[4370.76 - 4371.40] P:1532.14 E:0.025003 |  Throw it.
[4371.40 - 4373.48] P:1672.15 E:0.033355 |  Six minutes gone in the second half here on TVZ.
[4374.20 - 4375.32] P:1544.89 E:0.041106 |  Champions League final.
[4376.76 - 4377.56] P:1641.10 E:0.051734 |  Still 1-1.
[4379.72 - 4381.48] P:1589.59 E:0.036614 |  Throw taken by Chelsea.
[4381.48 - 4383.16] P:1579.57 E:0.036127 |  Lampard plays it back to Ession.
[4383.16 - 4383.96] P:1806.27 E:0.046729 |  Where's Ession?
[4383.96 - 4385.16] P:1667.94 E:0.030767 |  Inside right position.
[4385.16 - 4386.68] P:1805.77 E:0.036677 |  Schütz deflects off finish.
[4387.40 - 4388.92] P:1634.64 E:0.045409 |  Rekesche runs to Joe Cole.
[4388.92 - 4390.20] P:1446.51 E:0.037321 |  Joe Cole runs it over.
[4390.20 - 4391.16] P:1311.04 E:0.044065 |  Everett did very well.
[4391.16 - 4395.64] P:1653.28 E:0.039427 |  But Cole might get to the ball and Everett plays it off Joe Cole.
[4395.64 - 4396.68] P:1842.17 E:0.045671 |  But Joe Cole furious.
[4396.68 - 4397.88] P:1833.04 E:0.038108 |  He thinks he should have had a corner.
[4397.88 - 4399.00] P:1840.54 E:0.038817 |  Yeah, he's got to be steady.
[4399.00 - 4400.20] P:1698.01 E:0.044767 |  He's ringing out the referee.
[4401.16 - 4404.52] P:1418.15 E:0.042276 |  And now at the ref, now at the linesman.
[4404.52 - 4406.36] P:1534.17 E:0.035774 |  Decision's been made, Joe.
[4406.36 - 4408.44] P:1335.05 E:0.039631 |  You're not careful you'll be in that to...
[4408.44 - 4409.72] P:1787.39 E:0.045878 |  Well, he should have been in the yellow as well.
[4409.72 - 4411.64] P:1336.71 E:0.038601 |  He should have been in the put for that tackle on Carrick.
[4413.16 - 4414.44] P:1794.21 E:0.045377 |  Gold kick is taken short.
[4415.56 - 4417.48] P:1585.19 E:0.040426 |  By Van Dazaar to Viddic.
[4417.48 - 4419.24] P:1561.30 E:0.038232 |  Mike said to me at halftime, you know, Graham.
[4420.12 - 4421.64] P:1470.88 E:0.046642 |  Why you nipped to the little boys of him.
[4421.64 - 4423.40] P:1464.44 E:0.041229 |  He said, don't worry, Alan.
[4423.40 - 4423.96] P:1398.02 E:0.040356 |  You'll get the win.
[4423.96 - 4425.24] P:1634.11 E:0.043265 |  He was obviously feeling guilty.
[4425.24 - 4426.52] P:1488.55 E:0.035345 |  They've had nothing to draw.
[4426.52 - 4428.92] P:1534.10 E:0.037863 |  Comontate on in the first 22 and a half minutes.
[4428.92 - 4430.28] P:1342.80 E:0.040957 |  And I said, oh, no, I won't.
[4431.00 - 4432.76] P:1384.30 E:0.041477 |  And the way the second half has started,
[4432.76 - 4435.64] P:1588.52 E:0.033891 |  there's no chance of me describing the winner.
[4435.64 - 4438.20] P:1451.64 E:0.037876 |  Here's Balak hooking the ball high toward Drogba.
[4438.20 - 4441.72] P:1640.35 E:0.030904 |  Drogba was offside and it's a free kick to Manchester United.
[4441.72 - 4443.08] P:1720.49 E:0.035873 |  Such an untidy start.
[4443.08 - 4443.48] P:1571.58 E:0.044109 |  It is.
[4443.48 - 4445.32] P:1498.23 E:0.032809 |  The game's not settled down this half at all.
[4447.00 - 4449.80] P:1618.67 E:0.042041 |  Free kick played to Scholes under pressure from Balak.
[4450.36 - 4451.48] P:1488.44 E:0.027560 |  Gets it back.
[4451.48 - 4453.00] P:1627.86 E:0.031041 |  Just back to Viddic.
[4453.00 - 4454.52] P:1654.48 E:0.042198 |  Viddic lifts it forward.
[4454.52 - 4456.28] P:1615.21 E:0.036813 |  Joe Cole and the sets to this head.
[4456.28 - 4458.44] P:1383.03 E:0.039068 |  Good header back by Balak to McAleely.
[4458.44 - 4460.36] P:1460.75 E:0.040256 |  McAleely is almost running into trouble,
[4460.36 - 4464.52] P:1579.04 E:0.038009 |  but gets beyond Rooney finds Terry onto McAleely again.
[4465.48 - 4467.96] P:1573.05 E:0.036439 |  Chelsea must be encouraged by being level
[4467.96 - 4470.28] P:1483.97 E:0.037245 |  after being outplayed in the first 45 minutes.
[4471.00 - 4473.80] P:1506.35 E:0.035376 |  Ashley Cole on the far side to McAleely.
[4473.80 - 4476.68] P:1491.02 E:0.038259 |  Lampard again a poor pass from the England player
[4476.68 - 4479.08] P:1652.95 E:0.038508 |  straight out of play and it's a throw into Manchester United.
[4479.08 - 4481.24] P:1630.10 E:0.038621 |  Just for a period of time, we did see
[4481.24 - 4483.96] P:1278.97 E:0.034103 |  Chelsea just trying to link that ball together.
[4483.96 - 4487.00] P:1436.82 E:0.040029 |  Although they didn't end up being totally successful,
[4487.00 - 4488.92] P:1271.81 E:0.045955 |  but they need to do more of that.
[4489.48 - 4492.04] P:1627.39 E:0.037096 |  They haven't kept the ball anything like they should have done,
[4492.04 - 4495.08] P:1643.99 E:0.041250 |  but Credit Manchester United put them in the first half for that.
[4496.12 - 4499.88] P:1583.35 E:0.043401 |  Here's Carvalho with a header towards the United left flank.
[4499.88 - 4501.40] P:1464.90 E:0.038541 |  Kept in play by Evra.
[4501.40 - 4502.68] P:1452.07 E:0.036679 |  Ronaldo available.
[4502.68 - 4504.28] P:1442.11 E:0.029352 |  Ronaldo takes it up.
[4504.28 - 4505.88] P:1424.98 E:0.029371 |  Faced by Michael Balak.
[4505.88 - 4507.88] P:1624.50 E:0.040283 |  Ronaldo cheeses Balak, moves inside.
[4507.88 - 4509.16] P:1494.54 E:0.043949 |  Great play by Ronaldo.
[4509.16 - 4509.96] P:1504.33 E:0.038482 |  Finding Evra.
[4509.96 - 4510.92] P:1627.34 E:0.034414 |  He's a decent cross.
[4510.92 - 4512.12] P:1467.74 E:0.043082 |  Far post too high.
[4512.68 - 4515.40] P:1448.62 E:0.038451 |  Too high for Hargreaves and decided to play for a throw.
[4515.40 - 4516.36] P:1482.16 E:0.042511 |  What a poor cross.
[4517.00 - 4520.36] P:1663.40 E:0.040392 |  You know at this level, great play by Ronaldo.
[4520.36 - 4521.64] P:1832.88 E:0.039802 |  Releases Evra.
[4521.64 - 4522.60] P:1733.28 E:0.044900 |  Time to look up.
[4523.32 - 4524.60] P:1767.73 E:0.039667 |  Players in the box.
[4524.60 - 4525.80] P:1707.62 E:0.034888 |  Pick them in, drive it.
[4525.80 - 4529.56] P:1437.40 E:0.033384 |  Look what you don't do is over hit it and put it out for a throw in.
[4529.56 - 4531.40] P:1279.52 E:0.033819 |  Very, very disappointing end.
[4531.40 - 4532.60] P:1406.33 E:0.046208 |  Well, had it been the other way around,
[4532.60 - 4533.88] P:1157.67 E:0.042078 |  had Evra put Ronaldo through,
[4533.88 - 4536.12] P:1356.72 E:0.032255 |  you'd bet the cross would have been much, much better.
[4537.08 - 4540.76] P:1495.96 E:0.041930 |  Ashley Cole with a throw deep in his own half towards Drogba.
[4540.76 - 4542.76] P:1454.11 E:0.035487 |  Drogba was just leaning back on the defender,
[4543.32 - 4544.68] P:1465.05 E:0.037785 |  but player allowed to continue.
[4544.68 - 4546.44] P:1624.78 E:0.032599 |  Manchester United had possession.
[4546.44 - 4547.64] P:1435.88 E:0.034816 |  Then they lose it.
[4547.64 - 4548.52] P:1392.22 E:0.040876 |  Here's Michael Ailey.
[4548.52 - 4550.12] P:1432.43 E:0.041165 |  That's a good ball forward to Maluda.
[4550.12 - 4551.96] P:1590.12 E:0.037748 |  Now Maluda runs into the centre circle.
[4551.96 - 4553.40] P:1613.79 E:0.042449 |  And Manfrey in the far side.
[4553.40 - 4554.20] P:1697.12 E:0.033375 |  It's Essian.
[4554.20 - 4555.24] P:1535.93 E:0.040888 |  Park from right back.
[4555.24 - 4556.52] P:1600.41 E:0.037827 |  Essian moving forward.
[4556.52 - 4557.16] P:1739.39 E:0.035473 |  Steps in.
[4557.16 - 4558.84] P:1518.66 E:0.043324 |  Left foot, shoots over the crossbar.
[4560.52 - 4562.28] P:1807.28 E:0.045484 |  See what, he just had to get it on target
[4562.28 - 4564.28] P:1716.96 E:0.036160 |  because if you look, Bandasar slipped.
[4564.28 - 4566.92] P:1556.58 E:0.038105 |  He almost went to grounded Bandasar.
[4566.92 - 4570.28] P:1657.52 E:0.037468 |  I thought Essian was trying to bend it into the right post,
[4570.28 - 4572.04] P:1436.18 E:0.039229 |  into the right hand part of the net.
[4572.04 - 4574.04] P:1552.01 E:0.031844 |  He made a complete mess of it.
[4574.04 - 4576.04] P:1456.05 E:0.040725 |  As it happened, if he'd hit the target,
[4576.04 - 4578.76] P:1635.42 E:0.033764 |  I think it would have got in because Bandasar slipped.
[4578.76 - 4581.08] P:1605.75 E:0.043867 |  I think he wanted it really on his right foot,
[4581.08 - 4582.60] P:1601.31 E:0.034386 |  which is better than his left foot.
[4583.72 - 4585.80] P:1592.04 E:0.043091 |  But Bandasar was prone.
[4585.80 - 4587.96] P:1576.78 E:0.043598 |  He wouldn't have got to the ball if it had been on target.
[4589.48 - 4593.48] P:1594.45 E:0.039034 |  Well, that officially focuses my first effort on goal
[4593.48 - 4594.84] P:1599.26 E:0.042350 |  during my commentary in this game.
[4595.40 - 4598.04] P:1577.11 E:0.031868 |  Not that I get needles at this sort of stuff.
[4598.04 - 4600.76] P:1427.96 E:0.030477 |  I just like to commentate on better football.
[4601.72 - 4603.80] P:1609.93 E:0.039654 |  It has been a better game actually since Ronaldo
[4603.80 - 4604.92] P:1462.99 E:0.032150 |  put United in front.
[4605.00 - 4606.76] P:1405.30 E:0.033137 |  And then Lampard equalised.
[4606.76 - 4608.28] P:1502.82 E:0.035901 |  It's hit into the United half,
[4608.28 - 4610.92] P:1483.03 E:0.032065 |  but I think it's running down that far touch line,
[4610.92 - 4612.20] P:1596.13 E:0.036306 |  still in play.
[4612.20 - 4615.16] P:1620.49 E:0.032821 |  Officially, folks, it's midnight in Moscow.
[4615.16 - 4616.76] P:1667.40 E:0.032130 |  Isn't this ridiculous?
[4616.76 - 4618.12] P:1716.65 E:0.043333 |  Absolutely absurd.
[4618.12 - 4619.88] P:1464.95 E:0.036404 |  What are we doing playing football
[4620.60 - 4622.92] P:1549.16 E:0.036608 |  right across the continent of Europe at midnight?
[4623.48 - 4625.80] P:1779.17 E:0.037112 |  Stan Collymore, give me an excuse.
[4625.80 - 4626.84] P:1629.13 E:0.037743 |  Good morning, Alan.
[4626.84 - 4627.56] P:1293.18 E:0.035418 |  Oh, thanks, mate.
[4628.36 - 4629.56] P:1644.30 E:0.042003 |  It is absurd.
[4629.56 - 4630.76] P:1769.16 E:0.034719 |  It's interesting to note, though,
[4630.76 - 4634.44] P:1710.87 E:0.036665 |  that obviously Chelsea's goal came from a miss-it shot
[4634.44 - 4638.44] P:1379.75 E:0.036725 |  by Michael Essien and be mound Maka Leili
[4638.44 - 4640.28] P:1585.94 E:0.034867 |  sitting in that deep midfield position
[4640.28 - 4642.28] P:1499.39 E:0.036112 |  and not being the one to push out.
[4642.28 - 4644.36] P:1612.16 E:0.040389 |  Essien effectively now is playing up.
[4644.36 - 4645.32] P:1408.63 E:0.036665 |  Now we've seen it before.
[4645.32 - 4647.80] P:1525.74 E:0.036447 |  We're a right back come central midfielder.
[4647.80 - 4649.96] P:1492.11 E:0.040760 |  He's making 40-50 yard runs,
[4649.96 - 4651.16] P:1533.90 E:0.037713 |  and every time he gets the ball,
[4651.88 - 4653.80] P:1661.86 E:0.045761 |  Cristiano Ronaldo is really going to have to do a shift
[4653.80 - 4655.88] P:1715.35 E:0.035199 |  to try and pen Essien back now.
[4656.44 - 4657.80] P:1622.64 E:0.043690 |  He's capable of it.
[4657.80 - 4660.68] P:1658.96 E:0.041883 |  Now, Benic had to hit the ball out of play there,
[4660.68 - 4663.24] P:1701.18 E:0.031145 |  and Drover used the opportunity
[4663.24 - 4664.76] P:1585.99 E:0.042701 |  from the resulting Chelsea throw-in
[4664.76 - 4667.08] P:1569.06 E:0.039563 |  to sort of wave his arms at the Chelsea cry,
[4667.64 - 4669.88] P:1441.95 E:0.040164 |  urging encouragement from the club supporters.
[4669.88 - 4671.48] P:1406.71 E:0.042687 |  Here's Lampard after the throw-in.
[4671.48 - 4672.84] P:1605.56 E:0.040452 |  Good ball to actually goal.
[4672.84 - 4674.04] P:1590.76 E:0.037453 |  Just on the left of the penalty.
[4674.04 - 4675.16] P:1680.23 E:0.038574 |  Excellent cross in.
[4675.16 - 4676.20] P:1470.77 E:0.038073 |  Drover was there.
[4676.20 - 4678.04] P:1786.77 E:0.034910 |  So too was Benic.
[4678.04 - 4679.72] P:1572.94 E:0.037644 |  And Benic puts it behind for a corner.
[4679.72 - 4681.48] P:1847.50 E:0.038279 |  Excellent defending by Benic.
[4681.48 - 4683.80] P:1704.67 E:0.039248 |  Had to get down onto the floor to head it.
[4684.36 - 4685.16] P:1580.41 E:0.048733 |  Wide of the goal.
[4685.16 - 4686.60] P:1761.69 E:0.040519 |  Yes, he's conceded a corner,
[4686.60 - 4688.76] P:1375.12 E:0.038083 |  but with Drover bearing down on him,
[4688.76 - 4690.28] P:1647.75 E:0.033392 |  it was first-class defending.
[4691.00 - 4692.44] P:1537.15 E:0.040297 |  Corner to Chelsea.
[4693.24 - 4694.60] P:1508.20 E:0.042673 |  1-1 in Moscow.
[4694.60 - 4695.88] P:1605.27 E:0.040786 |  Played into the post-drop.
[4695.88 - 4697.80] P:1465.43 E:0.041875 |  Had an opportunity to head it forwards,
[4697.80 - 4699.88] P:1500.41 E:0.033290 |  but caught it awkwardly with his forehead,
[4699.88 - 4701.48] P:1532.18 E:0.028448 |  and it's harmlessly behind.
[4701.48 - 4702.44] P:1539.36 E:0.038156 |  High for a goal.
[4703.08 - 4704.36] P:1583.43 E:0.040538 |  The drug we came in,
[4704.36 - 4706.12] P:1538.76 E:0.047992 |  in and around the near post-aerial,
[4706.12 - 4707.88] P:1612.88 E:0.040433 |  on the edge of the six-yard box there.
[4707.88 - 4709.56] P:1430.94 E:0.045585 |  I'm not certain whether he headed it.
[4709.56 - 4710.52] P:1611.15 E:0.046023 |  It came off his shoulder,
[4710.52 - 4712.28] P:1341.21 E:0.036548 |  but it didn't take full advantage.
[4713.08 - 4714.60] P:1627.99 E:0.040683 |  Five-live at 10 o'clock,
[4714.60 - 4716.92] P:1691.68 E:0.035498 |  assuming a normal finish in this game.
[4717.72 - 4718.76] P:1716.35 E:0.041652 |  We'll have 6-0-6,
[4718.76 - 4721.48] P:1602.86 E:0.037329 |  which I'll be presenting from the Lezhiki Stadium in Moscow.
[4721.48 - 4725.08] P:1571.74 E:0.039757 |  The lines in our open, 0-599-693.
[4725.08 - 4726.36] P:1668.31 E:0.046778 |  Now, here's Michael Ballet.
[4726.36 - 4728.68] P:1586.95 E:0.042013 |  30 yards, I drive it in, that's a play.
[4729.72 - 4732.04] P:1566.49 E:0.036094 |  I think Van Duzard had it covered.
[4732.04 - 4733.80] P:1596.63 E:0.044495 |  I think Ballet has had more shots
[4733.80 - 4736.12] P:1684.47 E:0.036697 |  than any other Chelsea player in this game.
[4736.12 - 4737.48] P:1745.96 E:0.042906 |  But here he's got the space,
[4737.48 - 4738.68] P:1750.63 E:0.033417 |  he's got the time.
[4738.68 - 4740.76] P:1789.31 E:0.036908 |  You're expecting him to hit the target.
[4741.40 - 4742.28] P:1518.61 E:0.042171 |  You know, and he doesn't.
[4742.28 - 4743.32] P:1645.89 E:0.045011 |  It's well wide.
[4743.32 - 4744.52] P:1284.53 E:0.035770 |  Now, Van Duzard had it covered,
[4744.52 - 4745.72] P:1264.14 E:0.033580 |  but it was a good yard.
[4745.72 - 4747.00] P:1464.76 E:0.045641 |  Nobody closed him down.
[4748.12 - 4749.80] P:1532.68 E:0.040819 |  12 minutes played in the second half.
[4749.96 - 4752.36] P:1521.48 E:0.028613 |  11, Manchester United and Chelsea.
[4752.36 - 4753.40] P:1572.82 E:0.030635 |  And questionably United,
[4753.40 - 4754.68] P:1590.67 E:0.039843 |  the better team in the first half.
[4755.56 - 4757.48] P:1381.31 E:0.028824 |  But it's goals that the side matches.
[4758.60 - 4760.76] P:1510.99 E:0.034492 |  However, thought that the equaliser for Chelsea.
[4761.32 - 4763.64] P:1572.77 E:0.032743 |  Here's Tevez, who hasn't quite had the impact
[4763.64 - 4765.80] P:1365.31 E:0.033811 |  in the game that you hoped that he would have.
[4765.80 - 4767.56] P:1302.44 E:0.038758 |  He said two judges to score,
[4768.60 - 4769.88] P:1502.73 E:0.024319 |  and didn't take either of them.
[4770.60 - 4773.24] P:1330.41 E:0.036100 |  Ferdinand heads the ball back to Van Duzard.
[4774.28 - 4776.20] P:1435.07 E:0.026645 |  And Van Duzard out to Ferdinand again,
[4776.20 - 4777.56] P:1492.07 E:0.044965 |  on the far side of the field.
[4777.72 - 4779.96] P:1291.52 E:0.044091 |  On the far side of the field, it seems like a mile away.
[4781.32 - 4784.12] P:1684.43 E:0.040520 |  The stadium's quite shallow in terms of its seating,
[4784.12 - 4785.96] P:1338.03 E:0.043510 |  and we're quite high up.
[4785.96 - 4788.76] P:1343.32 E:0.040879 |  And midway between the halfway line
[4788.76 - 4791.24] P:1370.39 E:0.040588 |  and the goal occupied by Petter Csé.
[4792.52 - 4794.44] P:1532.83 E:0.036556 |  Vittis, that's a good drifted pass
[4794.44 - 4795.72] P:1428.58 E:0.036850 |  to the far side and Brown,
[4795.72 - 4798.36] P:1315.13 E:0.037469 |  who on the volley plays it into Carrick.
[4799.16 - 4800.84] P:1574.80 E:0.043437 |  Scoles available in the centre circle.
[4801.40 - 4803.40] P:1429.92 E:0.037898 |  Carrick though, on to Hargreaves.
[4803.40 - 4805.88] P:1385.30 E:0.036528 |  And now Brown again, to Hargreaves once more.
[4805.88 - 4808.28] P:1513.63 E:0.038963 |  Now, a level with the edge of the Chelsea penalty here.
[4808.28 - 4809.40] P:1607.89 E:0.036023 |  Two defenders across there.
[4809.40 - 4810.52] P:1414.94 E:0.037742 |  One is McAlely.
[4810.52 - 4813.40] P:1478.32 E:0.034161 |  McAlely gets in, a tackle, the balls out of play.
[4813.96 - 4815.80] P:1661.19 E:0.043808 |  Hargreaves has gone down, as if he's injured.
[4815.80 - 4817.48] P:1599.55 E:0.040167 |  And I tell you what, Hargreaves doesn't...
[4818.44 - 4820.92] P:1680.89 E:0.028032 |  He's holding his face again.
[4821.56 - 4822.84] P:1573.93 E:0.044532 |  Remember, Scoles...
[4824.28 - 4826.60] P:1438.39 E:0.036018 |  Well, clearly Hargreaves thinks that McAlely
[4827.32 - 4828.60] P:1311.84 E:0.046192 |  caught him quite deliberately.
[4829.16 - 4831.08] P:1607.75 E:0.041254 |  Scoles had blood from his nose
[4831.08 - 4834.28] P:1418.59 E:0.039489 |  after he made a tackle on McAlely in the first half.
[4834.28 - 4835.48] P:1502.85 E:0.044038 |  Was it a swinging elbow?
[4836.60 - 4838.52] P:1279.45 E:0.037503 |  A little bit, but not much.
[4838.52 - 4840.20] P:1449.52 E:0.034801 |  I don't think any intent whatsoever.
[4840.20 - 4841.00] P:1371.79 E:0.033667 |  No, I didn't think.
[4841.88 - 4843.08] P:1478.10 E:0.045461 |  He did catch him on the side of the game.
[4843.08 - 4844.04] P:1382.78 E:0.033189 |  He caught him.
[4844.04 - 4845.64] P:1150.22 E:0.039350 |  But I think the whole body movement,
[4845.64 - 4846.84] P:1329.83 E:0.046271 |  as you're trying to win the ball,
[4848.12 - 4849.40] P:1416.76 E:0.049612 |  was responsible for that.
[4850.28 - 4852.28] P:1607.22 E:0.041647 |  59 minutes play in Moscow.
[4852.92 - 4854.92] P:1589.04 E:0.044528 |  1-1 Manchester United and Chelsea.
[4855.56 - 4858.20] P:1430.85 E:0.030883 |  That check with the Chelsea free kick.
[4858.92 - 4861.48] P:1470.63 E:0.043119 |  And then it's with Maluda on the far side of the field.
[4861.48 - 4864.12] P:1457.59 E:0.031878 |  Maluda to the left of the fennel chair.
[4864.12 - 4865.16] P:1529.84 E:0.037041 |  Back to Lampard.
[4865.24 - 4866.76] P:1573.33 E:0.038820 |  Lampard now into the fennel chair.
[4866.76 - 4867.96] P:1476.13 E:0.037044 |  Lampard tries to cross the ball.
[4867.96 - 4870.36] P:1582.23 E:0.039854 |  It's blocked by Ferdinand and rebounds for a corner.
[4871.16 - 4874.04] P:1633.27 E:0.042453 |  Well, he's taken the corner there by attacking,
[4874.04 - 4875.40] P:1564.51 E:0.045722 |  by being very positive.
[4876.28 - 4878.28] P:1563.85 E:0.047138 |  We've seen Lampard do that on occasions.
[4878.28 - 4880.12] P:1561.32 E:0.037420 |  We've seen him skip past defenders.
[4880.12 - 4882.84] P:1426.24 E:0.043001 |  Wasn't able to do this that time, but got the corner.
[4882.84 - 4884.28] P:1742.32 E:0.042612 |  Chelsea played into the near post.
[4884.28 - 4886.60] P:1596.22 E:0.033090 |  Brilliant defending by Manchester United.
[4886.60 - 4887.32] P:1488.39 E:0.037607 |  That was Vittic.
[4887.32 - 4889.00] P:1447.69 E:0.030988 |  What a wonderful headed clearance.
[4890.04 - 4890.68] P:1500.32 E:0.045131 |  Under pressure.
[4891.32 - 4893.56] P:1627.27 E:0.044207 |  But Chelsea have seen far more of the ball
[4893.56 - 4894.92] P:1537.93 E:0.035369 |  in the second half than they did.
[4895.00 - 4896.44] P:1622.10 E:0.038814 |  At any stage in the first half.
[4897.24 - 4898.52] P:1500.75 E:0.034223 |  On the far side.
[4898.52 - 4900.60] P:1375.27 E:0.030348 |  It's with Maluda.
[4900.60 - 4902.52] P:1415.69 E:0.037182 |  Maluda back to McAleely.
[4902.52 - 4904.92] P:1398.40 E:0.040414 |  And United have got everybody back defending in their own half.
[4904.92 - 4905.80] P:1583.56 E:0.035519 |  Here's Essian.
[4905.80 - 4907.08] P:1421.84 E:0.039122 |  That never mind right back.
[4907.08 - 4908.92] P:1421.18 E:0.032546 |  He's in central midfield at the moment.
[4908.92 - 4910.04] P:1605.38 E:0.037978 |  Holding off Skoles.
[4910.04 - 4911.48] P:1603.75 E:0.036404 |  Feeds the ball to the right.
[4911.48 - 4912.44] P:1611.64 E:0.039240 |  To Joe Cole.
[4912.44 - 4913.56] P:1717.34 E:0.035256 |  And to Essian again.
[4913.56 - 4914.60] P:1490.66 E:0.031740 |  Edge of the fennel chair.
[4914.60 - 4915.24] P:1710.14 E:0.039731 |  Slip there.
[4915.24 - 4916.36] P:1606.97 E:0.031169 |  Was tackled.
[4916.36 - 4918.52] P:1576.74 E:0.038927 |  Ball breaks to Rooney and Rooney.
[4918.52 - 4920.28] P:1604.60 E:0.037132 |  Back in his own penalty area.
[4920.28 - 4921.24] P:1631.28 E:0.041779 |  Bounce the ball upfield.
[4921.24 - 4922.76] P:1551.56 E:0.041351 |  Tebbings is on his own.
[4922.76 - 4924.04] P:1598.48 E:0.038338 |  Mistake by Ashley Cole.
[4924.04 - 4925.72] P:1558.75 E:0.038895 |  Heading the ball straight to the Argentine.
[4925.72 - 4926.68] P:1463.78 E:0.038108 |  There's no support.
[4926.68 - 4928.20] P:1587.90 E:0.031222 |  McAleely gets an attack on.
[4928.20 - 4929.80] P:1650.41 E:0.039043 |  And Chelsea are secure once more.
[4931.08 - 4932.44] P:1579.24 E:0.049265 |  Number of players slipping.
[4932.44 - 4934.76] P:1641.54 E:0.043410 |  And Tebbings there slipped when they had the opportunity
[4934.76 - 4935.72] P:1543.47 E:0.040888 |  to get away from it.
[4935.72 - 4938.68] P:1588.13 E:0.038121 |  I don't know if it's the pitch or actually their footwear.
[4938.68 - 4940.28] P:1585.85 E:0.039495 |  Ballack to Lampard.
[4940.28 - 4942.52] P:1532.21 E:0.045726 |  And it was Lampard pulled down there by Hargreaves.
[4942.52 - 4943.24] P:1852.79 E:0.033463 |  He walls.
[4943.24 - 4944.60] P:1722.97 E:0.041044 |  It's a free kick to Chelsea.
[4945.32 - 4947.32] P:1752.15 E:0.045102 |  And Hargreaves reacted quite badly there.
[4948.60 - 4950.84] P:1851.66 E:0.041052 |  In terms of the way through the ball back to Lampard.
[4951.48 - 4954.44] P:1914.64 E:0.037877 |  A referee decides not to take any stern action.
[4954.44 - 4955.64] P:1933.46 E:0.032424 |  But as I said, it's touchy.
[4956.20 - 4957.08] P:1756.17 E:0.024100 |  You know.
[4957.08 - 4959.48] P:1629.29 E:0.040288 |  I hate to say it but you could have ascending off there easily.
[4959.48 - 4960.28] P:1712.69 E:0.040032 |  Free kick taken.
[4960.28 - 4961.24] P:1561.55 E:0.037682 |  Break ball in.
[4961.24 - 4963.64] P:1679.97 E:0.038863 |  Ashley Cole doesn't pull it back correctly.
[4963.64 - 4964.84] P:1657.75 E:0.033402 |  The lead it was waiting.
[4964.84 - 4966.28] P:1641.18 E:0.039627 |  But here's Ballack to Lampard.
[4966.28 - 4967.00] P:1581.79 E:0.033187 |  Back to Ballack.
[4967.00 - 4968.04] P:1519.11 E:0.032948 |  Into the penalty area.
[4968.04 - 4968.92] P:1489.86 E:0.039478 |  Low cross in.
[4968.92 - 4970.36] P:1608.90 E:0.036582 |  Skips off the head of Perdan.
[4970.36 - 4971.32] P:1548.28 E:0.039642 |  High into the air.
[4971.32 - 4972.04] P:1543.37 E:0.035694 |  Heading away.
[4972.04 - 4973.40] P:1743.07 E:0.034734 |  Estian with a bad challenge.
[4973.40 - 4974.92] P:1542.28 E:0.038733 |  And he knows it on Ronaldo.
[4974.92 - 4976.68] P:1646.54 E:0.034601 |  And that surely will be a yellow card.
[4976.68 - 4977.64] P:1598.04 E:0.032275 |  No, it's not.
[4977.64 - 4979.00] P:1475.78 E:0.038050 |  No, he's not going to give that.
[4979.00 - 4982.52] P:1698.29 E:0.036064 |  Estian knew that he was definitely going to be second best there.
[4982.52 - 4983.08] P:1707.65 E:0.049273 |  Came in.
[4984.04 - 4985.64] P:1802.03 E:0.043097 |  Certainly didn't go in with his feet.
[4985.64 - 4989.00] P:1594.43 E:0.046774 |  But got his body in the way deliberately on Ronaldo.
[4989.00 - 4989.96] P:1467.52 E:0.039368 |  Brought him to the ground.
[4991.48 - 4993.48] P:1569.43 E:0.045496 |  And it was a free kick to Manchester United.
[4994.76 - 4995.40] P:1469.00 E:0.046388 |  Van Dazaar.
[4995.40 - 4997.00] P:1565.05 E:0.040061 |  And it was penalty area to take it.
[4997.56 - 4999.56] P:1570.24 E:0.044212 |  61 minutes gone here in Moscow.
[5000.68 - 5003.88] P:1288.28 E:0.039968 |  Van Dazaar carefully plays the free kick to the far side of the field.
[5003.88 - 5004.76] P:1308.20 E:0.042886 |  And wears Brian.
[5004.76 - 5006.92] P:1438.69 E:0.030095 |  And Brian hits it from right to left.
[5006.92 - 5008.84] P:1431.69 E:0.038301 |  Aiming it roughly in the direction of Ronaldo.
[5008.84 - 5010.76] P:1335.61 E:0.034126 |  Heading away by Carvalho.
[5010.76 - 5011.88] P:1382.99 E:0.033354 |  Avra kept the ball in play.
[5011.88 - 5014.12] P:1617.89 E:0.038137 |  But good play by Joe Cole.
[5014.12 - 5018.36] P:1739.47 E:0.034231 |  Joe Cole to Balak who's brought down by Tevez.
[5019.16 - 5021.48] P:1798.22 E:0.032258 |  And look, you know, Balak reacted to Tevez.
[5021.48 - 5022.36] P:1616.64 E:0.033423 |  Said something to him.
[5022.36 - 5023.24] P:1541.66 E:0.030527 |  Balak reacted.
[5025.40 - 5025.96] P:1321.54 E:0.039276 |  Not clever.
[5027.56 - 5029.48] P:1615.79 E:0.039292 |  I've got a dodgy head phone connection.
[5030.28 - 5033.72] P:1434.49 E:0.037506 |  And that's why I'm trying to hold that plug in.
[5034.36 - 5035.72] P:1592.58 E:0.043068 |  It's very nice of you to offer as well.
[5035.72 - 5037.56] P:1538.78 E:0.035366 |  Well, such a friend.
[5038.52 - 5040.36] P:1652.85 E:0.037962 |  Anyway, free kick is taken.
[5040.36 - 5041.48] P:1552.84 E:0.045407 |  High towards Joe Cole.
[5041.48 - 5043.80] P:1555.22 E:0.035091 |  Joe Cole tackled though by Ferdinand.
[5043.80 - 5044.84] P:1672.06 E:0.029766 |  And I can switch headphones.
[5044.84 - 5045.80] P:1652.03 E:0.031156 |  Just talk away.
[5045.80 - 5046.44] P:1355.26 E:0.051257 |  There we are then.
[5046.44 - 5048.36] P:1471.69 E:0.025809 |  You've got your headphones so it's silver crisp now.
[5049.16 - 5051.88] P:1360.11 E:0.049716 |  You're just looking at nothing happening in the game, thankfully.
[5051.88 - 5054.28] P:1557.05 E:0.048488 |  So I don't have to make any comment whatsoever.
[5054.28 - 5055.96] P:1530.14 E:0.042696 |  Have you got your headphones back on now?
[5056.92 - 5057.72] P:1848.85 E:0.047211 |  Oh, what did you say?
[5057.72 - 5058.52] P:1172.04 E:0.049256 |  Yeah, there we are.
[5058.52 - 5059.40] P:1298.11 E:0.034418 |  I know, I know.
[5059.40 - 5059.96] P:1327.63 E:0.031932 |  What are you?
[5059.96 - 5060.92] P:1579.53 E:0.035221 |  Hey, listen, mate.
[5060.92 - 5063.08] P:1640.55 E:0.033983 |  We actually have a broadcast line.
[5063.08 - 5064.36] P:1419.44 E:0.032833 |  Do you remember October?
[5064.36 - 5066.44] P:1360.62 E:0.035176 |  Mobile phone for the first 20 minutes.
[5066.44 - 5067.24] P:1454.72 E:0.055358 |  I can remember that.
[5067.24 - 5067.96] P:1236.36 E:0.043656 |  Don't worry.
[5067.96 - 5069.40] P:1389.39 E:0.035089 |  On a quote phone line.
[5070.36 - 5071.32] P:1359.80 E:0.046368 |  Never to be forgotten.
[5073.96 - 5077.56] P:1626.20 E:0.041536 |  United and Chelsea fans tried to urge their team
[5077.56 - 5078.76] P:1585.39 E:0.034903 |  into a commanding position.
[5079.32 - 5080.52] P:1408.75 E:0.042271 |  Neither commands at the moment.
[5080.52 - 5081.64] P:1669.31 E:0.036961 |  It's one goal each here.
[5081.64 - 5084.04] P:1628.42 E:0.035284 |  BBC radio lines open for 606.
[5084.04 - 5086.12] P:1630.25 E:0.039224 |  0599, 693.
[5086.12 - 5087.64] P:1676.24 E:0.039311 |  Terry and Carvalho hesitate.
[5088.20 - 5089.88] P:1591.83 E:0.036984 |  Rooney almost bars his way through
[5089.88 - 5094.20] P:1491.53 E:0.032028 |  but the fast practice check and the goalkeeper hits it up field.
[5094.20 - 5095.88] P:1747.10 E:0.034325 |  Straight into the United's possession again.
[5096.60 - 5098.36] P:1683.38 E:0.034795 |  Ferdinand back to Van Daza.
[5099.08 - 5101.56] P:1718.00 E:0.038974 |  Van Daza lifts a careful clearance
[5101.56 - 5102.92] P:1675.31 E:0.034021 |  towards this near side of the field.
[5102.92 - 5104.60] P:1531.70 E:0.034406 |  The United left at Everett.
[5105.24 - 5107.24] P:1655.54 E:0.040328 |  Just passing the ball out for the goalkeeper.
[5107.24 - 5107.96] P:1544.47 E:0.041685 |  Excellent play.
[5107.96 - 5110.12] P:1594.00 E:0.034931 |  Here's Ronaldo to Tevez now.
[5110.12 - 5111.56] P:1434.47 E:0.039225 |  35 yards on goal.
[5111.56 - 5114.84] P:1607.94 E:0.035992 |  Tevez didn't get the fast right to hard greaves at all.
[5114.84 - 5117.16] P:1726.27 E:0.039346 |  Ashley Cole to Maluda, Maluda slips.
[5117.64 - 5119.88] P:1592.02 E:0.035502 |  And here's hard greaves into Ronaldo.
[5119.88 - 5121.48] P:1504.68 E:0.035083 |  Oh, good play by Ronaldo.
[5121.48 - 5123.88] P:1810.00 E:0.033471 |  He has played exceptionally well tonight.
[5123.88 - 5124.68] P:1734.73 E:0.044221 |  Here's Scholes.
[5125.32 - 5125.80] P:1818.66 E:0.034736 |  Scholes.
[5125.80 - 5127.88] P:1404.19 E:0.037650 |  Ronaldo available again but ignored.
[5127.88 - 5129.56] P:1611.22 E:0.033402 |  Pass goes to Carrick instead.
[5129.56 - 5132.04] P:1670.68 E:0.035292 |  Carrick lifts it high towards Rooney.
[5132.04 - 5133.80] P:1497.84 E:0.038266 |  And Rooney's not going to get there.
[5133.80 - 5135.08] P:1565.09 E:0.029561 |  Not going to keep the ball in play.
[5135.08 - 5136.76] P:1614.51 E:0.040727 |  Talking about Christ who made an impact.
[5136.76 - 5138.20] P:1630.49 E:0.033576 |  Rooney hasn't made an impact yet.
[5138.76 - 5139.40] P:1534.63 E:0.043385 |  None at all.
[5140.92 - 5142.44] P:1651.81 E:0.043036 |  It's cleared up field by Chelsea.
[5143.00 - 5145.40] P:1642.45 E:0.042165 |  Droga was filed there by Finish.
[5145.40 - 5147.48] P:1733.99 E:0.036802 |  I think Droga had slipped initially.
[5147.48 - 5149.80] P:1750.57 E:0.043015 |  There was actually no need for Finish to file him in.
[5149.80 - 5150.84] P:1591.82 E:0.036983 |  He got away with that.
[5150.84 - 5151.48] P:1650.49 E:0.025798 |  Definitely.
[5151.48 - 5153.64] P:1552.48 E:0.043392 |  I think in the main visits handled him well
[5153.64 - 5155.64] P:1527.89 E:0.040919 |  but there'll always be the occasion
[5155.64 - 5158.04] P:1502.92 E:0.030512 |  when the fouls are given against the centre back.
[5158.04 - 5161.24] P:1517.72 E:0.043702 |  Particularly, you know, competing against the first
[5161.24 - 5162.76] P:1579.74 E:0.034473 |  and the size of Droga.
[5162.76 - 5164.76] P:1570.14 E:0.040385 |  The centre forward will win the free kicks.
[5165.48 - 5168.20] P:1560.88 E:0.039200 |  Well, if Mike's right, and I'm going to describe a winning goal,
[5168.20 - 5169.72] P:1634.12 E:0.039978 |  it better come in the next three minutes.
[5169.72 - 5172.12] P:1605.13 E:0.041533 |  That's assuming the winner is in normal time.
[5172.12 - 5174.04] P:1679.33 E:0.039249 |  But we might have extra time.
[5175.72 - 5179.32] P:1523.79 E:0.043729 |  So often a feature of European Cup and Champions League finals.
[5180.20 - 5183.40] P:1586.63 E:0.038034 |  And four of the Champions League finals have gone to family shootouts.
[5183.40 - 5187.00] P:1588.22 E:0.032988 |  Maluda left it a freaking, played it well, but clear.
[5187.00 - 5189.32] P:1653.86 E:0.038089 |  That was an outstanding clearance by Michael Carey
[5189.32 - 5190.84] P:1707.93 E:0.036651 |  because if he got a poor touch in that,
[5190.84 - 5192.84] P:1856.79 E:0.034979 |  he could have knocked it into his own net.
[5192.84 - 5194.04] P:1635.11 E:0.042042 |  He had to go for the ball.
[5194.04 - 5196.52] P:1617.57 E:0.035598 |  It was a risk he took by instead of, you know,
[5196.52 - 5199.96] P:1518.17 E:0.037267 |  moving out, putting his foot out to it and you're quite right.
[5199.96 - 5203.16] P:1537.74 E:0.039774 |  Fortunately for him, it came off the right way.
[5203.16 - 5206.76] P:1377.65 E:0.038445 |  If he'd got the deflection, then you couldn't see anything other but an own goal.
[5206.76 - 5210.12] P:1410.67 E:0.035026 |  That's a great piece of defensive work by Michael Carey.
[5210.12 - 5212.68] P:1508.42 E:0.030013 |  Here's Michael Ballak to Lampard.
[5212.68 - 5215.96] P:1543.07 E:0.036097 |  Lampard sees that Ashley Cole's got plenty of room down the far side.
[5215.96 - 5218.12] P:1417.26 E:0.035410 |  Play is midway inside the United half.
[5218.12 - 5219.80] P:1455.68 E:0.030857 |  Ashley Cole to Lampard.
[5220.44 - 5221.48] P:1610.03 E:0.031424 |  Faced by Carey.
[5221.48 - 5222.60] P:1298.69 E:0.040710 |  Lampard still has the ball.
[5222.60 - 5223.80] P:1658.75 E:0.041430 |  Back kills it to Maluda.
[5223.80 - 5225.08] P:1664.06 E:0.033901 |  Maluda left foot shot.
[5225.08 - 5226.28] P:1648.10 E:0.031152 |  Deflects off burden.
[5226.28 - 5228.28] P:1696.39 E:0.030377 |  Everett tries to scoop it clear.
[5228.28 - 5230.44] P:1645.30 E:0.033893 |  Only high and Essians there.
[5230.44 - 5231.72] P:1397.27 E:0.041449 |  Level with the edge of the penalty.
[5231.72 - 5232.84] P:1602.00 E:0.039228 |  Excellent play by Essian.
[5232.84 - 5233.56] P:1659.55 E:0.036411 |  Into Ballak.
[5233.56 - 5234.44] P:1682.76 E:0.035188 |  Lampard shoots.
[5234.44 - 5237.56] P:1497.15 E:0.036146 |  Comes off the head of Vinic and behind it goes for a corner.
[5237.56 - 5238.92] P:1681.38 E:0.040668 |  And Chelsea are getting on top here.
[5238.92 - 5239.56] P:1715.05 E:0.038993 |  They are.
[5239.56 - 5241.72] P:1752.03 E:0.039164 |  As gradually as this half has progressed,
[5242.20 - 5245.48] P:1794.66 E:0.039183 |  Chelsea, I wouldn't say grind their way to it,
[5245.48 - 5249.24] P:1524.51 E:0.036849 |  but gradually have more passing, more of the play,
[5249.24 - 5251.64] P:1633.75 E:0.035245 |  and they're forcing Manchester United back.
[5251.64 - 5254.28] P:1532.38 E:0.042050 |  Another Chelsea corner again from the left side.
[5254.28 - 5256.52] P:1360.57 E:0.038848 |  And again delivered right footed by Lampard.
[5256.52 - 5257.80] P:1559.38 E:0.029453 |  Deeper this time.
[5257.80 - 5260.20] P:1545.82 E:0.037480 |  Van Dessar was nowhere and the header came off.
[5260.20 - 5262.04] P:1571.36 E:0.029741 |  Terry high over the crossbar.
[5262.04 - 5267.00] P:1590.30 E:0.040661 |  I think those were saying before the game that no goalkeeper likes opposition plays right around him.
[5267.00 - 5269.16] P:1618.09 E:0.036804 |  But as you get older that little bit,
[5269.88 - 5272.76] P:1534.92 E:0.035057 |  Van Dessar takes an instant dislike to that.
[5272.76 - 5275.56] P:1371.00 E:0.045438 |  He's always looking at the referee from the word goers,
[5275.56 - 5278.28] P:1444.67 E:0.034819 |  if he's being fouled, which is not always the case.
[5279.00 - 5284.04] P:1452.95 E:0.034904 |  Goal kick taken by Edwin Van Dessar towards Ronaldo.
[5284.04 - 5286.84] P:1471.82 E:0.034091 |  And I think he'll set a playoff, Essian's head.
[5286.84 - 5289.08] P:1527.86 E:0.039576 |  It'll be a throw in to Manchester United.
[5289.08 - 5291.72] P:1558.62 E:0.035671 |  I wonder when Sir Alex will make a change.
[5291.72 - 5294.68] P:1511.28 E:0.040402 |  Because I do expect Ryan Giggs at some stage in the game.
[5294.68 - 5295.80] P:1442.02 E:0.044894 |  And maybe Anderson.
[5296.76 - 5299.32] P:1504.38 E:0.036041 |  Here's Ebra with a throw to Tevez.
[5299.32 - 5301.00] P:1646.82 E:0.038395 |  Tevez hasn't done a great deal.
[5301.00 - 5303.72] P:1465.78 E:0.037513 |  And here's Joe Cole picking it up, running forward.
[5303.72 - 5305.16] P:1567.00 E:0.036048 |  Drucker's in a good position.
[5305.16 - 5306.84] P:1423.38 E:0.032568 |  Cole tried to pick him up with a pass,
[5306.84 - 5309.48] P:1688.07 E:0.033326 |  but I think it ricocheted off Carrick,
[5309.48 - 5311.80] P:1588.83 E:0.039365 |  and it goes behind for another Chelsea corner.
[5311.80 - 5316.04] P:1599.15 E:0.040599 |  Yeah, a little bit of pressure now from Chelsea with the succession of corners.
[5317.48 - 5320.04] P:1607.36 E:0.036061 |  This time it's from the right-hand side.
[5320.04 - 5321.80] P:1705.16 E:0.032799 |  So Mellouda's going to take it.
[5321.80 - 5322.92] P:1405.91 E:0.030956 |  Left footed.
[5322.92 - 5324.20] P:1465.68 E:0.032824 |  Well, Balak's up there.
[5324.20 - 5325.40] P:1298.59 E:0.040459 |  Carvalho's up there.
[5325.88 - 5329.96] P:1608.15 E:0.033177 |  John Terry just pulls his socks up and drug them.
[5329.96 - 5331.72] P:1506.34 E:0.033370 |  All excellent in the air.
[5331.72 - 5332.76] P:1551.61 E:0.039898 |  Mellouda comes.
[5332.76 - 5334.12] P:1634.48 E:0.034936 |  Left footed in swing corner.
[5334.12 - 5335.32] P:1208.42 E:0.034401 |  Doesn't beat the first defender.
[5335.32 - 5336.60] P:1439.85 E:0.029085 |  That was Ronaldo.
[5336.60 - 5339.00] P:1621.80 E:0.037282 |  But the clearance runs harmlessly to Essian.
[5339.00 - 5341.08] P:1595.67 E:0.035437 |  Essian back to McAlele.
[5341.08 - 5343.08] P:1488.17 E:0.037218 |  McAlele on to Balak again.
[5343.08 - 5344.36] P:1714.60 E:0.035729 |  Promising for Chelsea.
[5344.36 - 5346.12] P:1647.02 E:0.037048 |  Dinks it in towards John Terry.
[5346.12 - 5348.52] P:1477.18 E:0.032652 |  Headed away by Ferdinand Limping.
[5348.52 - 5350.44] P:1422.36 E:0.037121 |  Ferdinand's limping quite badly at the moment.
[5350.44 - 5351.24] P:1680.40 E:0.041364 |  He's got a problem.
[5352.04 - 5354.76] P:1668.33 E:0.035257 |  The United Captain is struggling with an injury.
[5354.76 - 5356.36] P:1529.11 E:0.041523 |  Mellouda on to Lampard.
[5356.36 - 5357.72] P:1541.50 E:0.036570 |  Lampard into the penalty.
[5357.72 - 5358.52] P:1623.87 E:0.036753 |  Pills it back.
[5358.52 - 5363.08] P:1590.17 E:0.037039 |  And Ferdinand can hardly limp even as he knocked that ball away.
[5363.08 - 5366.60] P:1629.08 E:0.035808 |  It's still in play and the referee has now blown his whistle
[5366.60 - 5369.16] P:1718.56 E:0.035540 |  so that Real Ferdinand can receive treatment
[5369.16 - 5370.36] P:1628.64 E:0.040519 |  after a word from Grimte.
[5370.36 - 5372.36] P:1877.77 E:0.039052 |  It went midway through the second half.
[5372.36 - 5373.24] P:1919.95 E:0.033817 |  It'll be Mikey.
[5373.24 - 5375.64] P:2011.37 E:0.039578 |  I think that's a correct decision by the referee.
[5375.64 - 5378.52] P:1998.92 E:0.037844 |  It was pretty obvious that Ferdinand was limping.
[5378.52 - 5379.96] P:1924.11 E:0.042592 |  And he'd seen the referee had seen that.
[5379.96 - 5382.12] P:1798.25 E:0.042594 |  And when he had to clear it with his injured leg,
[5382.12 - 5383.64] P:1810.10 E:0.039545 |  he immediately went to floor.
[5383.64 - 5385.56] P:1768.62 E:0.036885 |  Yes, the ball didn't go out of play,
[5385.56 - 5389.16] P:1669.89 E:0.034892 |  but I think the referee was quite right to stop play
[5389.16 - 5390.68] P:1527.14 E:0.037507 |  and bring on the physiotherapist.
[5391.40 - 5393.24] P:1752.19 E:0.038325 |  I just wonder whether it's Kramp-Graham
[5393.96 - 5395.48] P:1760.37 E:0.045025 |  and nothing more serious than that.
[5395.48 - 5398.84] P:1669.15 E:0.036856 |  And of course, it would be desperate for Manchester United
[5398.84 - 5400.52] P:1664.14 E:0.046319 |  to lose their captain at this stage.
[5400.52 - 5402.60] P:1657.37 E:0.033342 |  Stan, let's hear from you. Stan Collinville.
[5402.60 - 5404.60] P:1606.79 E:0.039996 |  Yeah, I think that it is Kramp.
[5404.60 - 5405.72] P:1727.15 E:0.037625 |  The stretches are coming on,
[5405.72 - 5409.08] P:1425.26 E:0.039860 |  but certainly the way it looked was if it wasn't a hamstring.
[5409.08 - 5411.96] P:1555.20 E:0.041955 |  If it was a torn hamstring or a little hamstring strain,
[5411.96 - 5413.32] P:1282.56 E:0.047918 |  he would have been able to move around.
[5413.32 - 5417.48] P:1416.91 E:0.035429 |  Kramp does get you, makes you go to ground quite quickly.
[5417.48 - 5420.12] P:1548.19 E:0.038780 |  And he certainly was in a lot of pain, Rio Ferdinand.
[5420.12 - 5423.48] P:1573.57 E:0.034776 |  But just going back, the left backs, Ashley Cole and Patrice Everett
[5423.48 - 5426.12] P:1521.43 E:0.041976 |  have had really two good opportunities in this half,
[5426.12 - 5428.20] P:1458.75 E:0.032214 |  both of them, to put crosses in
[5428.20 - 5429.88] P:1427.90 E:0.043732 |  when they've been inside the 18-yard box.
[5429.88 - 5432.68] P:1351.89 E:0.038468 |  And instead of going along the route with hard and low
[5432.68 - 5434.84] P:1647.13 E:0.035987 |  across the box, help it, somebody gets a touch in it
[5434.84 - 5437.40] P:1572.36 E:0.037615 |  and scores a goal. It's been poor pass selection.
[5437.40 - 5441.24] P:1620.71 E:0.041993 |  First, Patrice Everett tried to dink it over to the far post.
[5441.32 - 5443.48] P:1708.89 E:0.040122 |  Tore decision and Ashley Cole was saying.
[5445.96 - 5451.16] P:1592.55 E:0.042119 |  Frank Lampard is also receiving some attention as well down there.
[5451.16 - 5452.92] P:1755.69 E:0.037823 |  And I think I said in the first half
[5452.92 - 5454.92] P:1709.21 E:0.042532 |  when there was an injury to Dedier-Drogba
[5454.92 - 5457.24] P:1733.91 E:0.036647 |  that it came at a very good time to Chelsea
[5457.24 - 5459.80] P:1797.16 E:0.033889 |  because they were really up against it.
[5459.80 - 5462.92] P:1777.96 E:0.040045 |  This timeout has actually come at a good time for Manchester United.
[5462.92 - 5465.56] P:1688.31 E:0.040682 |  It is because as this second half has progressed,
[5465.56 - 5467.80] P:1636.13 E:0.037419 |  Chelsea have come more into the game.
[5467.80 - 5469.64] P:1336.12 E:0.042039 |  They've had more control of the ball.
[5469.64 - 5472.20] P:1690.18 E:0.029474 |  They've passed it amongst themselves
[5472.20 - 5475.64] P:1475.89 E:0.041108 |  and kept it for much longer than they were able to do in the first half.
[5475.64 - 5479.08] P:1563.64 E:0.043324 |  And Manchester United, you know, just being gradually moved back.
[5480.04 - 5483.00] P:1746.82 E:0.040710 |  You may not have heard the last commentary tonight from Alan Green
[5483.00 - 5484.60] P:1418.57 E:0.031160 |  because the way things are heading,
[5484.60 - 5486.84] P:1625.65 E:0.035991 |  we are heading for extra time here.
[5486.84 - 5489.56] P:1870.28 E:0.040351 |  Joe Cole, though, takes possession for a Chelsea side,
[5489.56 - 5491.24] P:1753.31 E:0.037244 |  playing much brighter in the second half.
[5491.24 - 5493.96] P:1734.13 E:0.042926 |  Cole makes some room for himself, drives the ball into Woodstrogba.
[5494.52 - 5496.28] P:1794.63 E:0.039046 |  And it's cleared by Manchester United.
[5496.28 - 5500.76] P:1553.32 E:0.037027 |  You just wonder, though, now as we have 20 minutes of normal time to go,
[5500.76 - 5502.92] P:1698.02 E:0.043459 |  whether it might become a little more cagey.
[5504.20 - 5505.96] P:1678.88 E:0.047237 |  The ball is with McElhane of Chelsea,
[5505.96 - 5507.96] P:1662.56 E:0.035971 |  playing from left to right here in this second half.
[5507.96 - 5509.16] P:1736.78 E:0.043499 |  You're listening to BBC Radio.
[5509.16 - 5511.48] P:1682.55 E:0.037341 |  It was all Manchester United in the first half.
[5511.48 - 5513.72] P:1751.43 E:0.040540 |  They led through Ronaldo after 26 minutes.
[5513.72 - 5515.24] P:1769.73 E:0.037102 |  There were other opportunities.
[5515.24 - 5518.28] P:1699.84 E:0.038308 |  Right before halftime, Lampard got a couple of lucky breaks,
[5518.28 - 5519.48] P:1742.31 E:0.036468 |  equalised with Chelsea.
[5519.48 - 5521.40] P:1764.46 E:0.039563 |  And they're such a resilient side, Chelsea.
[5521.96 - 5524.44] P:1655.55 E:0.041107 |  They are a much different proposition in the second half.
[5524.44 - 5525.88] P:1818.92 E:0.042294 |  We've had no substitutions yet.
[5526.52 - 5528.68] P:1660.42 E:0.044473 |  Banderzar clears, Ferdinand's OK now.
[5529.56 - 5531.08] P:1622.44 E:0.043071 |  Tevez won't get that in the air.
[5531.08 - 5533.80] P:1786.94 E:0.037465 |  Rooney picks up the pieces, just on the edge of the area.
[5533.80 - 5536.60] P:1771.08 E:0.041097 |  Wayne Rooney, square ball to Hargreaves on the edge of the area.
[5536.60 - 5538.12] P:1813.83 E:0.038132 |  Hargreaves now to Carrick.
[5538.12 - 5539.96] P:1821.83 E:0.039022 |  Carrick with a shot, didn't get hold of it.
[5539.96 - 5541.08] P:1686.79 E:0.038107 |  He's got a reflection, though.
[5542.04 - 5543.56] P:1739.32 E:0.048345 |  And Manchester United have a corner.
[5544.60 - 5548.84] P:1730.62 E:0.041265 |  Yeah, there. I don't know who is the Chelsea player that's laying down.
[5548.84 - 5549.80] P:1414.78 E:0.033916 |  McElhane.
[5549.80 - 5550.92] P:1316.70 E:0.046098 |  McElhane, he's down.
[5550.92 - 5552.52] P:1370.96 E:0.038071 |  I think it may have come off in for the corner,
[5552.52 - 5555.72] P:1470.02 E:0.038716 |  but he went down very early and he stayed there.
[5555.80 - 5558.84] P:1563.87 E:0.040060 |  Looks like the fissile will be coming on to McElhane
[5558.84 - 5560.04] P:1372.44 E:0.038231 |  before the corner is taken.
[5561.00 - 5563.88] P:1702.98 E:0.040546 |  Well, there's quite a bit for Sir Alex Ferguson
[5563.88 - 5566.04] P:1593.78 E:0.037576 |  and Avram Grant to think about now,
[5566.04 - 5569.96] P:1738.54 E:0.035627 |  because they do have many other options, of course, on the bench.
[5569.96 - 5573.00] P:1778.52 E:0.035093 |  And Sir Alex Ferguson was talking, it was Tevez.
[5575.32 - 5576.60] P:1691.81 E:0.043692 |  And it wasn't a great challenge.
[5576.60 - 5577.40] P:1632.18 E:0.046460 |  Did you see that again?
[5577.40 - 5577.88] P:1105.74 E:0.059197 |  I did, yes.
[5577.88 - 5578.52] P:1784.74 E:0.044060 |  Yeah, what did you think?
[5578.52 - 5581.24] P:1671.59 E:0.039179 |  Well, I thought that Tevez almost jumped on McElhane,
[5581.24 - 5581.56] P:959.54 E:0.031112 |  isn't it?
[5581.56 - 5584.04] P:1690.53 E:0.033071 |  He was almost like trying to piggyback him,
[5584.04 - 5586.60] P:1367.36 E:0.039180 |  and he's got his hand right round his face.
[5587.16 - 5589.40] P:1236.89 E:0.046105 |  And then McElhane goes down as well.
[5589.40 - 5591.40] P:1188.54 E:0.039239 |  And as I say, the physios are at the moment,
[5591.40 - 5593.80] P:1424.54 E:0.042564 |  and they're treating McElhane while we wait,
[5593.80 - 5596.52] P:1621.14 E:0.041584 |  then for the corner to be taken from Manchester United.
[5597.40 - 5600.84] P:1669.01 E:0.044691 |  Well, Sir Alex Ferguson made quite a lot of the fact
[5600.84 - 5605.00] P:1670.18 E:0.042767 |  that he thinks he's got stronger resources now at Manchester United.
[5605.72 - 5607.80] P:1689.57 E:0.041498 |  And he may well look to the bench,
[5607.80 - 5610.36] P:1649.66 E:0.040811 |  as indeed Avram Grant might have to now,
[5610.36 - 5612.28] P:1447.36 E:0.043593 |  if Claude McElhane can't continue.
[5613.08 - 5614.92] P:1646.25 E:0.039209 |  They're still hoping that he can carry on.
[5614.92 - 5618.36] P:1689.32 E:0.036295 |  And in the meantime, this is a corner for Manchester United.
[5619.00 - 5623.24] P:1757.29 E:0.039646 |  So Chelsea mustn't be distracted by this knock to Claude McElhane.
[5624.52 - 5629.08] P:1965.15 E:0.041138 |  So it will be a corner, and waiting patiently to take it is Owen Hargreaves.
[5630.20 - 5632.68] P:1716.10 E:0.041561 |  Ferdinand and Evera just discussing tactics.
[5632.68 - 5634.44] P:1640.20 E:0.039354 |  From the moment Ferdinand is staying back,
[5635.08 - 5638.20] P:1624.83 E:0.038511 |  Rooney, as ever, in that dangerous area,
[5638.20 - 5640.84] P:1572.32 E:0.042230 |  looking for ricochets on the edge of the box.
[5641.80 - 5643.80] P:1558.22 E:0.047633 |  Ronaldo's headed one goal here tonight.
[5643.80 - 5646.28] P:1692.91 E:0.039558 |  Tévez is standing inside the six-yard area.
[5646.92 - 5650.20] P:1641.24 E:0.043109 |  Corner kick will be taken by Hargreaves to the far post,
[5650.20 - 5652.52] P:1774.14 E:0.032829 |  and Czech was clapping to try and get it,
[5652.52 - 5653.80] P:1670.07 E:0.042778 |  headed away in the end.
[5653.80 - 5656.60] P:1604.62 E:0.031004 |  But I think the free kick might have been given for the foul on Czech.
[5656.60 - 5659.32] P:1369.04 E:0.048546 |  Yeah, I think the referee saw that very early.
[5659.88 - 5661.24] P:1430.40 E:0.037832 |  I think many people there,
[5661.24 - 5664.20] P:1443.66 E:0.040898 |  there'd been a little bit of shoving about people.
[5664.20 - 5667.00] P:1459.84 E:0.043762 |  There's half a dozen Manchester United players up there,
[5667.64 - 5669.64] P:1435.24 E:0.048121 |  same number of Chelsea players as well.
[5669.72 - 5671.48] P:1471.55 E:0.044350 |  And a little bit of shoving had gone,
[5671.48 - 5674.60] P:1279.41 E:0.044065 |  and I think the referee looked at that from the word go.
[5676.36 - 5680.60] P:1476.06 E:0.034734 |  It's getting tense now here in Moscow, way past midnight.
[5681.48 - 5684.20] P:1578.55 E:0.044283 |  As Evera clears, and he hasn't got the ball out of play.
[5684.20 - 5685.32] P:1850.31 E:0.042265 |  Esián keeps it in.
[5686.28 - 5688.04] P:1683.69 E:0.045270 |  Esián now for Joe Cole.
[5688.04 - 5691.00] P:1687.32 E:0.039857 |  Joe Cole's ball travels a long way through the penalty area,
[5691.00 - 5692.84] P:1609.77 E:0.045340 |  and Manchester United now will bring it out.
[5692.84 - 5695.24] P:1687.56 E:0.038470 |  Sir Alex Ferguson stands in the technical area
[5695.24 - 5698.36] P:1687.54 E:0.029638 |  for about the first time tonight, watching his side,
[5698.44 - 5701.40] P:1807.40 E:0.039429 |  carry, turning away from two Chelsea players in midfield,
[5701.40 - 5704.20] P:1803.72 E:0.039394 |  and then very smoothly picks out Ronaldo.
[5704.76 - 5706.84] P:1693.78 E:0.041261 |  Ronaldo now for Manchester United,
[5706.84 - 5709.80] P:1690.37 E:0.038067 |  hugging the touch line and going past Esián.
[5709.80 - 5711.88] P:1743.26 E:0.039501 |  Ronaldo approaching the penalty area,
[5711.88 - 5713.72] P:1782.57 E:0.042855 |  still Ronaldo, red shirts waiting,
[5713.72 - 5714.84] P:1433.81 E:0.031430 |  and then in the end there's nothing.
[5715.56 - 5718.04] P:1752.69 E:0.040940 |  Although I think he's got the corner, he hasn't.
[5718.04 - 5719.40] P:1762.75 E:0.044949 |  Chelsea can't believe it.
[5719.40 - 5722.76] P:1736.20 E:0.042814 |  Joe Cole's furious, but Ronaldo has won the corner.
[5722.76 - 5725.00] P:1716.95 E:0.040799 |  Yeah, it surprised me a little bit there,
[5725.00 - 5726.76] P:1558.69 E:0.047049 |  but the referee's right on the spot,
[5726.76 - 5728.20] P:1602.69 E:0.042208 |  so you can't argue with him,
[5728.20 - 5730.84] P:1511.58 E:0.040027 |  but still two players, Balak and Joe Cole,
[5730.84 - 5733.16] P:1423.48 E:0.035997 |  complaining bitterly that the corner's been given.
[5734.04 - 5737.16] P:1578.48 E:0.040625 |  Sir Alex Ferguson just calls over Evera to speak to him,
[5738.12 - 5740.76] P:1618.06 E:0.045156 |  third in and stays back inside the centre circle.
[5741.64 - 5744.68] P:1770.73 E:0.039838 |  Hargreaves prepares to take a Manchester United corner kick,
[5744.68 - 5746.92] P:1695.83 E:0.040849 |  one-one in the Champions League final,
[5746.92 - 5749.00] P:1529.16 E:0.040288 |  and it's too high for Ronaldo this time.
[5749.00 - 5751.40] P:1309.86 E:0.032962 |  Can't control ahead, runs away for a goal kick.
[5751.40 - 5752.04] P:1604.43 E:0.028677 |  Stan Coddimal.
[5752.04 - 5754.60] P:1650.54 E:0.044547 |  Yeah, just noting there's great skill by Cristiano Ronaldo
[5754.60 - 5757.16] P:1590.02 E:0.038534 |  on the left, where it absolutely, categorically,
[5757.16 - 5758.12] P:1642.06 E:0.045169 |  wasn't a corner.
[5758.12 - 5761.56] P:1678.83 E:0.038841 |  See on the replay, it was a scuff from Cristiano Ronaldo.
[5761.56 - 5764.20] P:1523.72 E:0.037570 |  Referee was behind it, but didn't manage to see that,
[5764.20 - 5766.84] P:1371.12 E:0.039818 |  so he obviously thought it was coming off Joe Cole,
[5766.84 - 5768.20] P:1423.65 E:0.037296 |  but it should have been a goal kick.
[5769.32 - 5772.52] P:1684.50 E:0.044872 |  And the UEFA official down there is inviting Sir Alex Ferguson
[5772.52 - 5775.64] P:1553.36 E:0.036295 |  to step back a couple of inches back into the technical area.
[5776.28 - 5777.80] P:1539.79 E:0.044321 |  Thou's scolls, who's been quite quiet,
[5777.80 - 5779.96] P:1610.09 E:0.038322 |  we don't seem to have mentioned him too many times
[5779.96 - 5780.84] P:1523.55 E:0.039034 |  in the second half.
[5781.40 - 5785.08] P:1513.00 E:0.042692 |  It's Manchester United won Chelsea one in the Champions League final
[5785.08 - 5786.28] P:1776.67 E:0.040904 |  on BBC Radio.
[5786.84 - 5789.16] P:1454.47 E:0.037502 |  Balak, who's been much more involved,
[5789.72 - 5791.64] P:1651.36 E:0.043272 |  much more instrumental in the second half.
[5792.36 - 5793.88] P:1670.40 E:0.043257 |  Throw into Manchester United,
[5795.00 - 5799.00] P:1581.52 E:0.039080 |  and Vidic Schnau for United, back inside his own half.
[5800.44 - 5802.92] P:1501.73 E:0.045256 |  The crowd wondering what comes next here in the final.
[5802.92 - 5805.64] P:1613.59 E:0.043865 |  Ronaldo against Cavalio, and Cavalio,
[5805.64 - 5807.08] P:1749.04 E:0.039442 |  for the second time really tonight,
[5807.08 - 5809.00] P:1742.66 E:0.032499 |  takes out his fellow countryman,
[5809.00 - 5810.52] P:1702.72 E:0.042137 |  the first time he got a yellow card.
[5811.08 - 5812.52] P:1698.50 E:0.029601 |  Free kick is taken,
[5812.52 - 5814.92] P:1700.74 E:0.037457 |  scolls gently with the ball inside the centre circle.
[5815.48 - 5819.00] P:1652.38 E:0.043076 |  United now again finding Ronaldo, just inside the Chelsea half,
[5819.00 - 5820.28] P:1665.96 E:0.041913 |  near side, the left,
[5820.28 - 5822.20] P:1895.20 E:0.039287 |  he's played exclusively down the left tonight.
[5822.76 - 5825.08] P:1793.23 E:0.045298 |  Ronaldo, he's got three Chelsea players around him,
[5825.08 - 5827.24] P:1831.26 E:0.037603 |  he's taking the ball to the dead ball line,
[5827.24 - 5828.52] P:1731.72 E:0.036168 |  but he's tackled by Joe Cole,
[5828.52 - 5830.60] P:1823.98 E:0.034342 |  and Balak thumps the clearance down the field.
[5830.60 - 5833.88] P:1844.58 E:0.035990 |  Again, a big gap between Drogba and the rest of the Chelsea side,
[5833.88 - 5836.60] P:1834.44 E:0.035492 |  and then it's just not back long by scolls to Van der Zyl.
[5836.60 - 5837.88] P:1649.99 E:0.048674 |  I don't know whether it's permanent, Mike,
[5837.88 - 5840.60] P:1699.62 E:0.035637 |  but I think there's been a change by Manchester United.
[5840.60 - 5842.92] P:1545.38 E:0.041260 |  Wayne Rooney out, wide on the right,
[5842.92 - 5845.88] P:1524.33 E:0.036167 |  Hargreaves coming into the middle to make three in the middle,
[5845.88 - 5848.44] P:1641.30 E:0.040088 |  Tevez on his own, centre forward,
[5848.44 - 5849.80] P:1404.50 E:0.042946 |  Ronaldo wide left,
[5849.80 - 5852.04] P:1454.86 E:0.032063 |  I think that is a change that they've made.
[5852.04 - 5854.04] P:1669.40 E:0.036001 |  Something perhaps different for Chelsea
[5854.68 - 5857.72] P:1638.97 E:0.045239 |  to think about, trying to get Rooney perhaps a little more on the ball.
[5857.72 - 5860.20] P:1827.01 E:0.038750 |  The ball is with Essie, and now down the Chelsea right.
[5860.92 - 5862.28] P:1588.31 E:0.044297 |  Plays the ball into McAleely,
[5862.28 - 5864.60] P:1668.07 E:0.039071 |  who's recovered from that blow he got a few moments ago.
[5865.32 - 5867.08] P:1466.21 E:0.030951 |  Balak finding Lampard,
[5867.08 - 5871.24] P:1608.22 E:0.031856 |  and now Lampard, and John Terry coming for the Chelsea captain.
[5871.24 - 5873.72] P:1768.87 E:0.047536 |  Terry's ball, he slips as he plays the ball into the area.
[5873.72 - 5876.84] P:1801.71 E:0.044167 |  Oh, and Drogba got out on the finish, and down goes Maluda!
[5878.36 - 5881.80] P:1749.47 E:0.037309 |  And the referee gives nothing for Chelsea.
[5881.80 - 5884.44] P:1719.18 E:0.037790 |  Well, it's a long way away, that action from here.
[5884.44 - 5885.72] P:1722.81 E:0.036735 |  Maluda went down,
[5885.72 - 5888.28] P:1766.93 E:0.037446 |  and the referee just gives Manchester United the goal kick.
[5888.28 - 5889.96] P:972.08 E:0.040511 |  Well, I thought Maluda might have handled it.
[5889.96 - 5891.16] P:1667.63 E:0.030894 |  It's certainly not a free kick.
[5891.96 - 5894.04] P:1562.17 E:0.045091 |  The referee completely right, he trips himself up.
[5894.04 - 5895.16] P:1678.74 E:0.040211 |  He trips himself up, yeah.
[5895.16 - 5898.60] P:1524.65 E:0.044813 |  Well, that action, a way to our right,
[5899.32 - 5902.92] P:1562.95 E:0.034935 |  as Ronaldo gives the ball back to Scholes,
[5902.92 - 5904.20] P:1900.19 E:0.045657 |  and Manchester United regroup,
[5904.20 - 5906.36] P:1755.14 E:0.033109 |  and then Viddicke threads it towards Tevez.
[5906.36 - 5908.12] P:1738.62 E:0.028445 |  Graham Taylor just pointing out, then,
[5908.12 - 5911.48] P:1668.26 E:0.037365 |  that Rooney now is over on the right against Ashley Cole.
[5911.48 - 5913.40] P:1712.11 E:0.032311 |  Tevez going to play down the centre.
[5913.40 - 5916.12] P:1778.41 E:0.035299 |  It's very flexible, of course, the front three for Manchester United.
[5917.08 - 5918.44] P:1668.53 E:0.041635 |  And the next goal could win it.
[5918.44 - 5920.60] P:1713.80 E:0.036846 |  Essie in with a Chelsea throw in near side.
[5920.60 - 5923.88] P:1615.74 E:0.040812 |  Manchester United won, Chelsea won on BBC Radio.
[5923.88 - 5927.64] P:1691.67 E:0.037390 |  Into the last 15 minutes of the 90, and now then...
[5928.52 - 5929.24] P:1675.48 E:0.042246 |  Joe Cole...
[5931.88 - 5933.56] P:1608.44 E:0.044691 |  Way off the ball, has gone down.
[5933.56 - 5936.60] P:1656.68 E:0.029776 |  There's... I'm short of the half-way line.
[5936.60 - 5939.16] P:1701.55 E:0.037412 |  There's words between Drogba and the referee, and Everett.
[5939.16 - 5940.60] P:1690.50 E:0.040915 |  I have no idea what happened there.
[5942.76 - 5943.88] P:1877.63 E:0.053117 |  You're not getting a replay.
[5943.88 - 5947.72] P:1913.79 E:0.034439 |  Joe Cole is now up on his feet and talking to pitch...
[5947.72 - 5949.08] P:1820.39 E:0.034679 |  And Alan's right.
[5949.08 - 5950.28] P:1813.88 E:0.038331 |  It's been very techy.
[5950.28 - 5950.92] P:2089.12 E:0.037845 |  There's, yeah.
[5950.92 - 5953.80] P:1439.99 E:0.031326 |  Very niggly, and quite unnecessary.
[5953.80 - 5954.36] P:1699.94 E:0.058879 |  Very, really.
[5954.36 - 5955.56] P:1506.64 E:0.020652 |  Well, what...
[5955.56 - 5956.92] P:1782.90 E:0.040177 |  Joe Cole's thrown himself down.
[5956.92 - 5958.04] P:1433.47 E:0.047154 |  A little bit of right.
[5958.04 - 5959.80] P:1331.00 E:0.036667 |  There was a right elbow for Man, Everett.
[5960.36 - 5961.00] P:1620.81 E:0.024852 |  He just...
[5962.44 - 5963.72] P:1431.09 E:0.049189 |  Well, the referee didn't see it.
[5963.72 - 5964.52] P:1610.68 E:0.046667 |  The officials didn't see it.
[5964.52 - 5967.40] P:1715.02 E:0.042736 |  The game continues, and Didier Drogba now is going forward.
[5967.40 - 5968.36] P:1814.09 E:0.034065 |  Drogba now.
[5968.36 - 5969.48] P:1766.40 E:0.038870 |  Drogba still slips.
[5969.48 - 5971.32] P:1772.37 E:0.035374 |  So many players going to ground here.
[5971.32 - 5972.92] P:1878.37 E:0.032739 |  It's Ashley Cole of Chelsea.
[5972.92 - 5974.28] P:1800.72 E:0.046160 |  Drogba with a shot!
[5974.28 - 5975.08] P:1815.98 E:0.047921 |  It's the post!
[5975.64 - 5979.64] P:1624.87 E:0.038048 |  Van Der Zarr was beaten, and Drogba's effort comes off the post,
[5979.64 - 5981.64] P:1697.10 E:0.035587 |  and Manchester United survive.
[5981.72 - 5984.20] P:1664.15 E:0.040308 |  Van Der Zarr completely beaten then.
[5984.20 - 5986.52] P:1713.64 E:0.041222 |  After slipping, Drogba gets himself open.
[5986.52 - 5990.60] P:1776.88 E:0.038701 |  Immediately, almost within the next step, he's taken the shot in.
[5990.60 - 5992.52] P:1614.15 E:0.033941 |  Bent it round, Van Der Zarr.
[5992.52 - 5994.04] P:1762.99 E:0.036197 |  Smashes against the post.
[5994.04 - 5995.96] P:1429.52 E:0.035148 |  Let off for Manchester United there.
[5995.96 - 5996.28] P:1721.78 E:0.022493 |  Right.
[5996.28 - 5997.80] P:1634.57 E:0.040533 |  Let's emphasise what's happening here.
[5997.80 - 5999.32] P:1723.18 E:0.043931 |  It was Manchester United's first half.
[5999.32 - 6000.76] P:1818.33 E:0.039390 |  It's been Chelsea's second half.
[6002.12 - 6005.56] P:1601.66 E:0.035282 |  And I wonder whether, as Tévez now...
[6007.00 - 6009.00] P:1792.28 E:0.044359 |  There's just too much of this going on.
[6009.00 - 6010.28] P:1812.72 E:0.039382 |  Tévez against Ballak now.
[6011.24 - 6013.88] P:1788.64 E:0.038385 |  And again, niggly, free-kick given.
[6013.88 - 6016.92] P:1823.16 E:0.042091 |  Louis Voschmier-Kell, actually, the referee's been quite lenient here
[6018.12 - 6021.00] P:1578.68 E:0.035393 |  with players on yellow cards, remember, from the first half.
[6021.00 - 6024.92] P:1682.12 E:0.039158 |  I can understand why Sir Alex has changed the formation,
[6024.92 - 6027.88] P:1517.43 E:0.041093 |  because Chelsea were certainly getting a lot more of the ball.
[6027.88 - 6030.76] P:1567.91 E:0.040393 |  But it does worry me when Manchester United do that.
[6030.76 - 6033.32] P:1683.38 E:0.033369 |  It's like an admission that, you know,
[6033.32 - 6035.72] P:1506.73 E:0.039673 |  yeah, we're not quite handling this right,
[6035.72 - 6038.92] P:1435.64 E:0.040368 |  and I still think they're better off doing what they did
[6039.00 - 6040.44] P:1640.18 E:0.041075 |  right from the start of the game
[6040.44 - 6042.68] P:1282.79 E:0.037898 |  by getting their attacking movements going.
[6043.24 - 6047.56] P:1648.50 E:0.047173 |  So I think it steps into favour Chelsea this at the moment.
[6048.44 - 6051.80] P:1710.91 E:0.043303 |  Well, Chelsea equalised against the run of play in the first half.
[6051.80 - 6054.68] P:1643.00 E:0.042645 |  Can Manchester United find a goal against the run of play?
[6054.68 - 6056.28] P:1737.38 E:0.036655 |  Jocoll again against Everett.
[6057.08 - 6060.84] P:1702.90 E:0.037106 |  Ball in the air, headed down by Lampard, helped on by Malouda.
[6060.84 - 6063.80] P:1766.35 E:0.031924 |  But Manchester United patrolling in defence.
[6063.80 - 6065.88] P:1748.74 E:0.037957 |  Ferdinand's header to Van Der Zarr.
[6066.60 - 6070.68] P:1590.62 E:0.033338 |  And now United bringing the ball out, playing from right to left.
[6070.68 - 6072.76] P:1666.47 E:0.036973 |  And they find Wes Brown over on the far side,
[6072.76 - 6074.04] P:1888.29 E:0.042179 |  and now Rooney joining in.
[6074.76 - 6077.08] P:1721.67 E:0.044384 |  But United have given the ball away,
[6077.08 - 6079.48] P:1784.52 E:0.038084 |  and Chelsea sense they could have the advantage here.
[6079.48 - 6081.32] P:1752.43 E:0.041508 |  And Malouda's looking brisk over on the left side.
[6081.32 - 6082.20] P:1743.73 E:0.039349 |  It did drop that!
[6082.20 - 6083.56] P:1550.90 E:0.036232 |  And Droga can't put it away.
[6084.44 - 6087.40] P:1703.07 E:0.038307 |  But Malouda, much more of a threat in the second half,
[6087.40 - 6090.20] P:1662.78 E:0.036727 |  played the ball into the near post, and Droga couldn't control it.
[6090.20 - 6092.52] P:1526.59 E:0.043999 |  I don't know whether to blame the surface or not,
[6092.52 - 6095.24] P:1324.49 E:0.036450 |  I don't know whether the footwear that some of these players have got on.
[6095.24 - 6099.00] P:1469.45 E:0.037263 |  But far too many for me are slipping at vital times,
[6099.00 - 6101.40] P:1422.60 E:0.036313 |  and you could really pay for it.
[6101.40 - 6103.88] P:1286.42 E:0.040747 |  In one respect, I hope it is the problem of the pitch,
[6103.88 - 6107.08] P:1458.01 E:0.037644 |  rather than having your wrong selection of boots on.
[6107.08 - 6108.84] P:1841.26 E:0.042442 |  Carrick of Manchester United, and now Scholes,
[6108.84 - 6110.44] P:1838.28 E:0.041063 |  10 minutes to go of the normal time here.
[6110.44 - 6113.72] P:1709.69 E:0.040268 |  1-1 in Moscow. Ronaldo on the ball for Manchester United.
[6114.68 - 6117.08] P:1847.48 E:0.043107 |  Jocoll doubling up to try and help out Michael Essian.
[6117.08 - 6119.16] P:1876.14 E:0.037835 |  Stepovers from Cristiano Ronaldo.
[6119.16 - 6120.68] P:2008.65 E:0.039977 |  Three Manchester United players waiting,
[6120.68 - 6122.92] P:1841.66 E:0.028624 |  and it's headed away easily by Cavalio.
[6123.00 - 6125.40] P:1760.46 E:0.031351 |  At the back for Chelsea.
[6126.12 - 6129.80] P:1837.26 E:0.038146 |  Throw-in. Still no changes made yet by either of the managers here.
[6130.44 - 6133.88] P:1552.85 E:0.035130 |  Aware that the players here could be facing an extra 30 minutes.
[6134.84 - 6136.20] P:1745.22 E:0.040092 |  Throw-in to Manchester United.
[6136.20 - 6139.56] P:1631.92 E:0.037747 |  Evra, who played in the final for Monaco against Porto.
[6141.00 - 6145.16] P:1558.73 E:0.040164 |  Evra throws into Tevez, who really hasn't quite delivered this evening.
[6145.16 - 6149.08] P:1679.30 E:0.039052 |  He may be one of the players who might make way if Manchester United make changes.
[6149.64 - 6151.00] P:1703.39 E:0.030086 |  Now, third inound.
[6151.00 - 6153.48] P:1689.94 E:0.034170 |  Finding Brown down the Manchester United right.
[6153.48 - 6154.84] P:1734.93 E:0.043843 |  Carrick's return ball.
[6154.84 - 6158.68] P:1808.96 E:0.034305 |  Looking for Brown. In comes Ashley Cole, and does well for Chelsea.
[6158.68 - 6161.40] P:1717.53 E:0.038302 |  And it's out of play for a Manchester United throw.
[6161.40 - 6164.20] P:1637.23 E:0.037156 |  We've just moved into the last 10 minutes here.
[6164.20 - 6166.04] P:1688.26 E:0.034574 |  The two goals in the first half.
[6166.04 - 6169.88] P:1625.43 E:0.035112 |  Ronaldo first. Lampard equalising for Chelsea.
[6171.16 - 6173.64] P:1497.92 E:0.037814 |  United at the moment, not moving it quickly.
[6173.64 - 6175.24] P:1642.44 E:0.041993 |  That's normally their game that they love.
[6175.24 - 6177.56] P:1408.72 E:0.035445 |  They love the tempo, the passing and the moving.
[6177.64 - 6178.36] P:1919.53 E:0.036125 |  Big goals now.
[6178.36 - 6180.44] P:1813.51 E:0.035958 |  Bit more height to this near side of the field.
[6180.44 - 6182.36] P:1682.96 E:0.033019 |  Evra cuts it back to Tevez.
[6182.36 - 6184.52] P:1638.96 E:0.034365 |  Tevez fans is a shot, and it's just wide.
[6184.52 - 6186.76] P:1711.26 E:0.033958 |  And I think Pettichek did have that one cut.
[6186.76 - 6187.56] P:1793.50 E:0.052981 |  Yes, I think he did.
[6187.56 - 6190.04] P:1782.26 E:0.037603 |  I just wondered if he'd got a slight deflection, it was.
[6190.04 - 6191.56] P:1786.44 E:0.033466 |  That was not the case.
[6191.56 - 6194.04] P:1665.14 E:0.042155 |  I mean, there's a little chance there for Manchester United.
[6194.04 - 6197.24] P:1560.91 E:0.034246 |  But as I've said, on a number of occasions,
[6197.24 - 6201.24] P:1581.30 E:0.038494 |  I just consume myself when they start to play in a formation
[6201.24 - 6203.96] P:1445.10 E:0.035402 |  that takes away their free-flowing football.
[6203.96 - 6204.92] P:1468.17 E:0.045828 |  If they play this way,
[6204.92 - 6207.48] P:1388.45 E:0.037330 |  they've got to get the ball to their front and wide men.
[6209.24 - 6211.88] P:1735.59 E:0.037493 |  United's first half, Chelsea second.
[6212.44 - 6213.48] P:1795.55 E:0.049509 |  One-one though still.
[6214.36 - 6215.48] P:1547.55 E:0.029259 |  Joe Cole.
[6215.48 - 6218.52] P:1737.81 E:0.034080 |  And now Lampard squirts the ball forward to Essian.
[6218.52 - 6222.44] P:1770.79 E:0.036463 |  Vidditch is there, and he can't give it back to Vandezare.
[6222.44 - 6225.64] P:1751.40 E:0.034828 |  And that just has to settle for a throw in to Chelsea.
[6226.76 - 6229.56] P:1663.71 E:0.035260 |  Now, the throw will be taken by Essian.
[6229.56 - 6231.40] P:1579.01 E:0.040427 |  Essian trying to find Joe Cole.
[6231.40 - 6233.64] P:1774.07 E:0.035730 |  Evra's back and will clear for Manchester United.
[6233.72 - 6234.92] P:1873.91 E:0.044526 |  Still inside their own half.
[6234.92 - 6236.20] P:1733.98 E:0.029953 |  In comes Cavalio.
[6236.20 - 6239.88] P:1697.07 E:0.036826 |  Chelsea have to be careful here, not to be vulnerable to the counter.
[6239.88 - 6241.72] P:1634.52 E:0.038546 |  They've still kept the ball well, though.
[6241.72 - 6245.48] P:1650.54 E:0.033437 |  And it's Terry inside the centre circle, down the centre to Maluda.
[6245.48 - 6247.96] P:1781.54 E:0.040450 |  Maluda sees Drogba in a good position down the left.
[6247.96 - 6249.16] P:1686.78 E:0.043869 |  Lampard's in the area.
[6249.16 - 6250.60] P:1831.67 E:0.035013 |  Drogba trying to set himself up.
[6250.60 - 6251.88] P:1749.57 E:0.029641 |  Bannock shot is high.
[6251.88 - 6255.56] P:1673.12 E:0.036135 |  And took it quickly and didn't control the effort at all.
[6255.56 - 6256.44] P:1765.17 E:0.042599 |  It's gone a long way back.
[6256.44 - 6257.00] P:1743.40 E:0.039852 |  Stan Collin.
[6257.80 - 6259.56] P:1739.86 E:0.042785 |  It's looking at the United bench.
[6259.56 - 6261.48] P:1777.38 E:0.036996 |  They're hurriedly giving instructions.
[6261.64 - 6263.24] P:1728.79 E:0.045072 |  Looks like they're going to be making a substitute.
[6263.96 - 6266.04] P:1715.73 E:0.041654 |  Certain Ryan Geeks is jogging over.
[6266.04 - 6269.56] P:1610.20 E:0.037511 |  First, I thought it might be Jon O'Shea or Darren Fletcher.
[6269.56 - 6271.24] P:1456.52 E:0.037423 |  But Ryan Geeks has been called in.
[6271.24 - 6272.52] P:1502.28 E:0.038371 |  Looks if he may welcome on.
[6273.48 - 6275.40] P:1627.15 E:0.043659 |  And what a moment, of course, it will be for him.
[6276.36 - 6278.76] P:1672.81 E:0.042127 |  It will break the Sebobbi Charlton appearance record.
[6279.88 - 6282.52] P:1653.03 E:0.043889 |  And when he equaled that record, of course, he scored the goal,
[6282.52 - 6284.60] P:1754.64 E:0.031745 |  which finally clinched the title,
[6284.60 - 6286.68] P:1683.68 E:0.032856 |  the Premier League title for Manchester United.
[6286.68 - 6288.60] P:1666.50 E:0.028814 |  Can Geeks make an impact here?
[6288.60 - 6290.84] P:1685.85 E:0.035252 |  About to come on, we think, for Manchester United.
[6291.48 - 6294.20] P:1721.72 E:0.039233 |  Ronaldo boxed in between a couple of Chelsea players,
[6294.20 - 6296.84] P:1739.46 E:0.038596 |  goes to the ground and wins a throw in.
[6297.48 - 6299.08] P:1693.06 E:0.041438 |  Esi and Rolukton to give the ball back.
[6300.20 - 6302.52] P:1559.28 E:0.034565 |  It's, is it a free kick or a throw in?
[6302.52 - 6304.28] P:1682.40 E:0.043385 |  I think he's given the free kick.
[6304.28 - 6307.16] P:1679.53 E:0.046978 |  Something was said from the Chelsea dugout area
[6307.16 - 6309.00] P:1329.41 E:0.035512 |  as Ronaldo kept looking back at them.
[6309.00 - 6310.20] P:1728.13 E:0.044334 |  Carrick chips the ball forward.
[6310.20 - 6311.16] P:1775.81 E:0.041376 |  Rooney's header down.
[6311.16 - 6313.48] P:1821.04 E:0.037845 |  Skoles trying to get their first for Manchester United.
[6313.48 - 6315.80] P:1898.98 E:0.037006 |  And Skoles does get their first for Manchester United.
[6315.80 - 6317.08] P:1772.78 E:0.031084 |  And now Carrick.
[6317.08 - 6318.84] P:1763.87 E:0.042718 |  Awkward ball for Teves to control.
[6318.84 - 6321.40] P:1789.32 E:0.037399 |  Teves played it in and it was scrambled away by Jon Tarris.
[6321.80 - 6324.04] P:1729.67 E:0.037871 |  Before Rooney could move on to it.
[6324.04 - 6326.52] P:1858.85 E:0.042095 |  And Chelsea clear, but they played Joe Cole into trouble,
[6326.52 - 6328.68] P:1679.54 E:0.037520 |  but the referee comes to his rescue.
[6328.68 - 6332.20] P:1717.83 E:0.033810 |  That's quite a confrontation between Joe Cole and Evera
[6332.20 - 6333.16] P:1786.44 E:0.027667 |  for a kick to Chelsea.
[6334.36 - 6336.04] P:1437.65 E:0.049067 |  The game really, at the present time,
[6336.04 - 6337.88] P:1328.46 E:0.037570 |  is really in the balance for me now,
[6337.88 - 6342.36] P:1602.50 E:0.036933 |  because any mistake by any player now could cost them the trophy.
[6342.36 - 6345.56] P:1544.34 E:0.044250 |  So you'll get that coming in and one or two tired legs.
[6345.56 - 6349.16] P:1589.77 E:0.042655 |  Be very interesting if and when the substitutions are made.
[6349.96 - 6354.44] P:1621.05 E:0.041779 |  In Barcelona, United went behind and won the Champions League.
[6354.44 - 6357.72] P:1637.07 E:0.036644 |  Here they went in front and now Chelsea are battling
[6357.72 - 6359.88] P:1650.89 E:0.043610 |  all the way for the victory themselves.
[6360.52 - 6365.00] P:1603.76 E:0.039345 |  And the linesman has given the kick to Chelsea near side.
[6366.12 - 6367.16] P:1585.83 E:0.040575 |  Failed by Viddic.
[6367.16 - 6368.92] P:1798.21 E:0.037061 |  And Maluda's across to take it.
[6369.48 - 6373.00] P:1621.93 E:0.038164 |  And Jon Tarris and Cavalio are quickly forward.
[6373.00 - 6375.64] P:1589.96 E:0.038061 |  Balak has scored some important goals with his head.
[6375.64 - 6377.48] P:1627.20 E:0.049732 |  Lampard lurks on the edge of the area
[6378.28 - 6379.08] P:1604.27 E:0.045812 |  with Joe Cole.
[6379.96 - 6384.12] P:1584.30 E:0.041830 |  So Balak, Terry, Cavalio, Drogba, all in the penalty area.
[6384.68 - 6387.48] P:1644.17 E:0.032056 |  And Maluda will take this kick with his left foot,
[6387.48 - 6389.16] P:1669.28 E:0.049976 |  attacking the goal away to our right
[6389.96 - 6392.04] P:1619.45 E:0.041028 |  with five minutes of normal time to go.
[6393.24 - 6394.68] P:1762.06 E:0.034854 |  Free kick to Chelsea.
[6394.68 - 6396.92] P:1826.18 E:0.040136 |  Maluda scoops it in towards Drogba.
[6396.92 - 6399.88] P:1698.72 E:0.038169 |  Drogba trying to turn, but denied by the Manchester United defenders.
[6400.44 - 6402.36] P:1697.10 E:0.043542 |  And they're appealing for the corner kick, Chelsea.
[6402.92 - 6406.68] P:1724.85 E:0.038494 |  But the linesman has given the goal kick to Manchester United.
[6406.68 - 6410.44] P:1546.31 E:0.042706 |  Well, I'm very clear the goal kick was given pretty well straight away
[6410.44 - 6412.52] P:1342.61 E:0.043026 |  by both the linesman and the referee.
[6412.52 - 6414.04] P:1220.42 E:0.038522 |  So you've got to get on with the play.
[6414.04 - 6416.68] P:1643.67 E:0.044109 |  Big moment in the history of Manchester United about to happen
[6416.68 - 6418.36] P:1784.92 E:0.038668 |  as Ryan Giggs steps forward.
[6419.40 - 6423.96] P:1643.80 E:0.040533 |  Ryan Giggs, Champions League winner with Manchester United in 1999.
[6423.96 - 6425.40] P:1663.44 E:0.043627 |  But the ball is with Chelsea.
[6426.04 - 6427.96] P:1667.63 E:0.034749 |  And it's Balak again for Chelsea.
[6427.96 - 6429.32] P:1786.38 E:0.037369 |  Options left and right.
[6429.88 - 6431.56] P:1623.31 E:0.034729 |  Plays it short to Lampard.
[6431.56 - 6433.16] P:1754.50 E:0.042850 |  Chelsea passing and moving at the moment.
[6433.16 - 6435.96] P:1620.44 E:0.035217 |  Joe Cole, but the ball breaks back again to Viddic.
[6436.68 - 6439.72] P:1685.03 E:0.043980 |  None of the United players in the starting line up tonight
[6439.72 - 6443.00] P:1607.20 E:0.032693 |  started that Champions League final against Bayern Munich.
[6443.56 - 6445.08] P:1585.57 E:0.038351 |  Giggs now about to come on.
[6445.08 - 6447.08] P:1531.29 E:0.039869 |  The next time the ball is out of play.
[6447.80 - 6451.08] P:1628.85 E:0.043592 |  And he may have not only the five minutes that remain,
[6451.08 - 6452.36] P:1782.36 E:0.037473 |  but perhaps an extra 30.
[6452.92 - 6454.84] P:1716.55 E:0.030066 |  Scoles of Manchester United.
[6454.84 - 6456.04] P:1682.11 E:0.046139 |  One-one here in Moscow.
[6456.76 - 6458.52] P:1681.14 E:0.042272 |  Live commentary on BBC Radio.
[6459.16 - 6461.48] P:1787.01 E:0.039960 |  The ball just inside the Chelsea half.
[6461.48 - 6464.44] P:1679.11 E:0.030175 |  And Giggs waits patiently to come on.
[6464.44 - 6467.24] P:1647.69 E:0.041398 |  Ronaldo not quite as effective in the second half.
[6467.24 - 6469.48] P:1804.80 E:0.036486 |  And that was a lazy touch by Ronaldo.
[6469.48 - 6471.96] P:1911.95 E:0.037101 |  Gives possession away very cheaply.
[6471.96 - 6473.80] P:1799.17 E:0.029852 |  It's Lampard now for Chelsea.
[6473.80 - 6475.24] P:1714.18 E:0.039015 |  Lampard to Malouda.
[6475.24 - 6477.48] P:1896.60 E:0.042289 |  Chelsea going to try and finish it off in normal time here.
[6478.36 - 6480.20] P:1807.73 E:0.046678 |  Malouda, skips over the ball.
[6480.20 - 6481.96] P:1616.64 E:0.035199 |  And now McElady finds Lampard.
[6482.52 - 6484.28] P:1789.61 E:0.041777 |  Lampard plays it short to Essie.
[6485.08 - 6487.40] P:1809.74 E:0.045243 |  Chelsea now looking to Malouda again.
[6487.40 - 6489.24] P:1841.57 E:0.039406 |  Malouda tangling with Hargreaves.
[6489.24 - 6490.44] P:1902.56 E:0.034935 |  In steps, Joe Cole.
[6490.44 - 6491.96] P:1825.96 E:0.040324 |  Poor challenge from Hargreaves.
[6491.96 - 6494.04] P:1699.04 E:0.041370 |  Joe Cole's knocked it into Drucker at the near post.
[6494.92 - 6496.84] P:1616.71 E:0.035951 |  And another appeal for a corner kick.
[6496.84 - 6497.72] P:1665.25 E:0.043670 |  And another goal kick.
[6497.72 - 6498.60] P:1701.44 E:0.041096 |  And now here it comes.
[6499.56 - 6504.28] P:1809.59 E:0.037013 |  Here comes Ryan Giggs to come on for Paul Scoles.
[6504.92 - 6510.20] P:1857.47 E:0.037716 |  And make his 759th appearance for Manchester United.
[6510.20 - 6512.04] P:1837.26 E:0.045080 |  And that sets a new club record.
[6512.60 - 6515.32] P:1783.29 E:0.043927 |  Breaking Savadi Charlton's 758th.
[6515.88 - 6519.32] P:1612.55 E:0.043702 |  Wonderful moment in a great career for Ryan Giggs.
[6519.32 - 6520.84] P:1799.92 E:0.048753 |  Yeah, another surprise really.
[6521.40 - 6527.40] P:1733.12 E:0.039197 |  You know, we saw less influence of Paul Scoles as the game has worn on.
[6527.40 - 6531.88] P:1549.28 E:0.031416 |  But it's a fantastic achievement by Ryan Giggs.
[6531.88 - 6534.60] P:1675.52 E:0.041376 |  And what a stage as well to make that appearance in.
[6535.16 - 6538.12] P:1558.98 E:0.036961 |  Here in Moscow, the Champions League final.
[6538.76 - 6541.40] P:1601.70 E:0.042044 |  We have three minutes to go of normal time.
[6541.96 - 6544.28] P:1567.30 E:0.039337 |  Probably a couple of minutes at least of added time.
[6544.28 - 6549.16] P:1578.83 E:0.032676 |  And then the prospect once more of extra time in a Champions League final.
[6549.64 - 6551.32] P:1480.76 E:0.032703 |  Brown into Rooney.
[6551.32 - 6554.28] P:1709.41 E:0.032601 |  And now Ronaldo's gone across into the centre this time.
[6554.28 - 6555.88] P:1761.45 E:0.029326 |  And finds Hargreaves.
[6555.88 - 6558.76] P:1805.98 E:0.036705 |  Hargreaves helps the ball onto Carlos Tevez.
[6558.76 - 6561.96] P:1759.30 E:0.038078 |  Giggs is waiting for a piece of the action on the edge of the area.
[6562.52 - 6563.96] P:1572.25 E:0.037385 |  The ball is with Hargreaves.
[6563.96 - 6565.88] P:1765.17 E:0.028343 |  Rooney trying to stay onside.
[6565.88 - 6566.76] P:1678.42 E:0.034122 |  Goes to Carrick again.
[6566.76 - 6568.36] P:1813.96 E:0.044101 |  A lot of passing here from Manchester United.
[6568.36 - 6571.64] P:1628.33 E:0.037058 |  But Chelsea have got everybody back, apart from Drogba, behind the ball.
[6571.64 - 6573.48] P:1844.24 E:0.035517 |  United just playing it square.
[6573.48 - 6575.72] P:1773.85 E:0.040640 |  And now it's with Brown over on the right.
[6576.36 - 6577.96] P:1885.47 E:0.035158 |  Brown doesn't get the cross in.
[6577.96 - 6580.92] P:1919.15 E:0.034006 |  Instead, hits it back about 20 yards to Carrick.
[6580.92 - 6583.00] P:1959.50 E:0.033080 |  This is patient stuff from Manchester United.
[6583.00 - 6584.04] P:1949.21 E:0.039918 |  But it's not threatening.
[6584.68 - 6586.52] P:1784.17 E:0.042014 |  And they're now back inside their own half.
[6587.56 - 6590.60] P:1892.78 E:0.032744 |  Everon, very cautious, very caging.
[6590.60 - 6592.12] P:1763.58 E:0.040009 |  One moment might settle it.
[6592.12 - 6595.72] P:1825.78 E:0.033171 |  As Carrick threads the ball in and it's an easy catch for Pitterton.
[6596.68 - 6599.00] P:1755.95 E:0.045981 |  Ryan Giggs has come on into a forward position.
[6599.00 - 6602.60] P:1675.63 E:0.036311 |  So it just leaves the two midfield players of Carrick and Hargreaves.
[6602.60 - 6605.32] P:1654.13 E:0.035272 |  I'm pleasing many respects because it means Alex Ferguson
[6605.32 - 6607.72] P:1478.14 E:0.028722 |  hasn't gone against these attacking principles.
[6608.28 - 6612.12] P:1524.51 E:0.045648 |  And he's coming out and they've got much more now into a 4-4-2 formation.
[6613.96 - 6617.56] P:1667.63 E:0.040728 |  Good strong headed clearance there by Brown of Manchester United.
[6617.56 - 6619.80] P:1669.39 E:0.047680 |  Chelsea don't clear it and then Rooney topples over.
[6621.48 - 6622.92] P:1795.37 E:0.045085 |  The free kick is given his way.
[6622.92 - 6624.20] P:1529.90 E:0.032489 |  Not sure he had the ball or...
[6625.00 - 6627.56] P:1732.78 E:0.040593 |  Anyway, the free kick is two Manchester United.
[6628.28 - 6632.20] P:1608.53 E:0.038817 |  Who had just started to have a little more possession in the last few minutes.
[6632.92 - 6635.48] P:1516.75 E:0.044207 |  And now they've got the running of Ryan Giggs,
[6636.36 - 6637.72] P:1709.75 E:0.041025 |  who's just come on from the bench.
[6637.72 - 6640.28] P:1800.21 E:0.034890 |  The free kick is tapped to the far side of the field.
[6640.28 - 6642.84] P:1773.93 E:0.037675 |  It's Brown of Manchester United and that's a high,
[6642.84 - 6647.16] P:1654.57 E:0.033459 |  hasty ball into the penalty area which runs away for a goal kick to Chelsea.
[6647.16 - 6650.12] P:1742.34 E:0.040711 |  Yeah, Wayne Rooney turns around and shows his disgust
[6650.84 - 6652.76] P:1547.35 E:0.039289 |  to Brown there, pointless he said.
[6652.76 - 6655.80] P:1581.84 E:0.044000 |  And it is really, but as I say, you have the four forwards now,
[6655.80 - 6658.92] P:1540.34 E:0.036229 |  Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney and Giggs.
[6658.92 - 6660.92] P:1630.48 E:0.043374 |  So there's some interchange going on as well,
[6660.92 - 6663.88] P:1322.05 E:0.037930 |  although Ronaldo's basically stayed on the left side.
[6663.88 - 6667.24] P:1302.11 E:0.038678 |  But I much rather see a Manchester United side playing like this.
[6668.84 - 6672.76] P:1563.01 E:0.044165 |  And just to underline for you here with 40 seconds of normal time to go
[6673.40 - 6677.96] P:1611.49 E:0.039940 |  and the prospect of extra time as Ferdinand clatters in against Joe Cole.
[6677.96 - 6679.72] P:1733.15 E:0.029840 |  The game still continues.
[6679.72 - 6681.32] P:1603.10 E:0.043955 |  The linesman have got his flag up there,
[6681.32 - 6685.72] P:1704.70 E:0.040427 |  but now Joe Cole up against Rio Ferdinand and the goal kick is given.
[6685.72 - 6690.28] P:1770.91 E:0.039311 |  I was about to say that it's actually now 25-1 in the morning here.
[6690.92 - 6693.32] P:1724.01 E:0.037836 |  So goodness knows what time we're going to finish.
[6694.04 - 6696.68] P:1647.43 E:0.038957 |  If we have the extra 30 and possibly even penalties.
[6697.32 - 6701.64] P:1407.82 E:0.039133 |  Certainly. I mean, we were talking about this before, what would happen if it went
[6702.84 - 6704.28] P:1568.22 E:0.048128 |  as long as this is not the first time.
[6704.28 - 6708.92] P:1320.45 E:0.035767 |  You remember, we spoke about the Liverpool game against Milan.
[6708.92 - 6710.04] P:1774.62 E:0.044207 |  Two minutes of added time.
[6711.08 - 6714.12] P:1771.82 E:0.046925 |  Two minutes of added time and we're just into those two minutes now.
[6715.32 - 6716.36] P:1719.92 E:0.055896 |  Chelsea have the ball.
[6717.00 - 6721.24] P:1783.61 E:0.039479 |  And how ironic it would be now if Chelsea scored in these last two minutes
[6721.24 - 6723.08] P:1587.49 E:0.040485 |  after everything that happened in Barcelona.
[6723.88 - 6725.96] P:1832.66 E:0.039014 |  Chelsea still yet to make a change.
[6725.96 - 6728.84] P:1631.90 E:0.030713 |  They may have to, of course, add in extra time.
[6729.40 - 6733.32] P:1615.06 E:0.038091 |  Chelsea have the ball and the ball is in towards Joe Cole,
[6733.32 - 6734.92] P:1604.13 E:0.035097 |  but Ferdinand's head was in the way.
[6735.56 - 6739.64] P:1683.82 E:0.036982 |  Chelsea flick it down the left-hand side and away from Ashley Cole.
[6739.64 - 6742.68] P:1647.72 E:0.040439 |  And do you think Graham over the last 10 minutes or so,
[6742.68 - 6745.32] P:1543.94 E:0.044661 |  it has got more cages with approach to the end of the 19th?
[6745.32 - 6747.40] P:1638.79 E:0.040482 |  Yeah, I think at the present time,
[6747.40 - 6749.64] P:1709.77 E:0.042871 |  they're aware of the stage of the game.
[6750.68 - 6752.52] P:1495.47 E:0.047679 |  Nobody will want to commit an error.
[6752.52 - 6755.08] P:1442.64 E:0.042364 |  They'd rather see this go through into extra time
[6755.08 - 6757.96] P:1578.27 E:0.040583 |  and it'll be very interesting to see the approach of either
[6757.96 - 6760.68] P:1601.90 E:0.040930 |  or both sides to that extra time period.
[6760.68 - 6763.08] P:1744.65 E:0.046627 |  And the fans who've been showing their tension, really,
[6763.08 - 6765.80] P:1817.03 E:0.036973 |  and now just revving it up again for their two sides
[6765.80 - 6769.24] P:1781.21 E:0.037445 |  in anticipation, perhaps, of extra time, it's Carlos Tevez.
[6769.72 - 6772.36] P:1764.18 E:0.040627 |  Tevez, one more chance maybe for Manchester United.
[6772.92 - 6776.36] P:1756.78 E:0.037305 |  Ronaldo to Everett, who just about keeps it in.
[6776.36 - 6779.16] P:1779.54 E:0.039105 |  Bit of magic finally from Ronaldo, perhaps here.
[6779.16 - 6780.84] P:1667.39 E:0.046365 |  Ronaldo into the area.
[6780.84 - 6784.36] P:1733.85 E:0.041006 |  McAleady's waiting for it and he's just knocked it straight out of play.
[6785.00 - 6789.00] P:1766.19 E:0.036006 |  And we've got 45 seconds of added time.
[6789.00 - 6792.04] P:1752.83 E:0.038200 |  Ronaldo receives following a United throw.
[6792.04 - 6794.60] P:1706.77 E:0.047013 |  Ronaldo's ball in towards Rooney.
[6794.60 - 6796.92] P:1529.48 E:0.041591 |  Went an awful long way through the six-yard area.
[6797.64 - 6799.08] P:1784.29 E:0.039641 |  Giggs came charging in as well.
[6799.08 - 6799.72] P:1754.74 E:0.050648 |  It's gone wide.
[6800.28 - 6802.92] P:1684.09 E:0.034608 |  It's a goal kick and we've got about 25 seconds to go.
[6802.92 - 6805.56] P:1506.91 E:0.042331 |  Ashley Cole did very well there at the back post.
[6805.56 - 6807.16] P:1676.32 E:0.031888 |  The ball had whipped in.
[6807.24 - 6810.44] P:1521.84 E:0.039066 |  He wasn't quite aware of where I think it was.
[6810.44 - 6814.60] P:1412.22 E:0.044229 |  Giggs was coming, but he had enough nows about him to let that ball go.
[6817.16 - 6821.80] P:1723.32 E:0.044676 |  10 seconds of added time at the end of the 90 here in Moscow,
[6822.52 - 6825.96] P:1640.29 E:0.037847 |  where it is approaching 20 to 1 in the morning.
[6825.96 - 6828.04] P:1635.26 E:0.041098 |  1-1 in the Champions League final.
[6828.04 - 6830.36] P:1708.36 E:0.034170 |  It's Michael Caracal, have to be quick.
[6830.36 - 6833.16] P:1793.36 E:0.038999 |  Down the centre towards Tevez, across comes Cavalio.
[6833.16 - 6834.04] P:1731.10 E:0.036335 |  Gets in first.
[6834.04 - 6836.92] P:1806.78 E:0.039669 |  There goes the whistle for the end of 90 minutes.
[6838.04 - 6839.16] P:1815.08 E:0.046403 |  And we've been here before.
[6840.12 - 6843.16] P:1655.50 E:0.041148 |  Almost inevitably, the Champions League final,
[6843.16 - 6845.72] P:1895.53 E:0.040741 |  which was so hard to call anyway between these two,
[6846.60 - 6849.56] P:1668.85 E:0.039310 |  is going to need an extra 30 minutes.
[6849.56 - 6852.04] P:1634.07 E:0.040472 |  The goal so far tonight in the first half,
[6852.04 - 6856.92] P:1583.74 E:0.038435 |  Ronaldo after 26, Lampard approaching half-time equalised.
[6856.92 - 6860.60] P:1646.25 E:0.038300 |  United's first half, Chelsea a thought-shade in the second half.
[6860.60 - 6863.88] P:1537.79 E:0.041698 |  And so we have an extra 30 minutes as a result of 1-1.
[6864.12 - 6867.00] P:1598.74 E:0.028213 |  Ferg is straight into the middle of Manchester United.
[6867.00 - 6870.76] P:1698.47 E:0.039159 |  Now, a long old chat with Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand there.
[6870.76 - 6875.32] P:1578.03 E:0.039747 |  Avron Grant sort of wandering around as he does so with the Chelsea side.
[6875.32 - 6877.72] P:1780.96 E:0.041226 |  It looks to me as if it's the Chelsea side,
[6877.72 - 6880.60] P:1766.15 E:0.032830 |  they're getting more treatment on their legs than Manchester United,
[6880.60 - 6883.32] P:1733.71 E:0.035357 |  who are all standing at the moment, just taking influence.
[6883.32 - 6885.88] P:1525.96 E:0.038241 |  United are on their feet, all the technical staff.
[6885.88 - 6888.36] P:1603.43 E:0.045207 |  They've got people like Jon O'Shea, Darren Fleck,
[6888.36 - 6890.28] P:1518.43 E:0.039215 |  midfield players that can come on.
[6891.00 - 6894.28] P:1264.26 E:0.036529 |  He's noticeable as well in that last 10-15 minutes,
[6894.28 - 6897.48] P:1311.37 E:0.041063 |  Owen Hargreaves, instead of being over on that right-hand side.
[6897.48 - 6900.44] P:1545.68 E:0.040747 |  He took more in as a midfielder when poor sculls came off,
[6900.44 - 6902.20] P:1447.48 E:0.040355 |  just to give them that little bit of solidity,
[6902.20 - 6904.92] P:1278.48 E:0.040362 |  because Chelsea were threatening at times
[6904.92 - 6906.36] P:1304.64 E:0.042294 |  to get within touching distance.
[6906.36 - 6909.80] P:1365.79 E:0.040845 |  Lampard and Ballak shot getting towards the edge of the box.
[6909.80 - 6913.00] P:1504.67 E:0.035996 |  Chelsea, they decided to take the group, sitting down,
[6913.00 - 6915.40] P:1356.80 E:0.042150 |  having a few massages, plenty of water.
[6915.40 - 6918.20] P:1508.01 E:0.039034 |  Avron Grant talking to Michael Ballak, I think it is down there, isn't it,
[6918.20 - 6920.36] P:1780.98 E:0.039493 |  who's getting a few stretches as well.
[6920.36 - 6923.56] P:1535.65 E:0.037227 |  Quite forcefully, he's doing now, going round all of his players.
[6923.56 - 6927.96] P:1480.64 E:0.038894 |  And, well, there's not an awful lot that they could do at this stage.
[6929.00 - 6929.80] P:1303.36 E:0.048735 |  What do you do here?
[6929.80 - 6931.40] P:1594.51 E:0.038292 |  Do you have a little bit of a crack now?
[6931.40 - 6934.68] P:1606.52 E:0.033602 |  And then we go back to the KG stuff for the second half of extra time,
[6934.68 - 6935.80] P:1359.90 E:0.026499 |  or what's that?
[6935.80 - 6938.68] P:1420.58 E:0.037295 |  I think that for Manchester United,
[6938.68 - 6940.68] P:1665.49 E:0.041045 |  it's trying to get ball retention.
[6940.68 - 6945.80] P:1574.36 E:0.036508 |  Chelsea, by far, are the best of it in the final 20-25 minutes or so.
[6945.88 - 6948.84] P:1611.65 E:0.039435 |  And I think that, certainly in this extra period of time now,
[6948.84 - 6954.52] P:1546.27 E:0.035383 |  you'll see likes a drop, but reluctant to go chasing after central defenders,
[6954.52 - 6957.48] P:1460.92 E:0.041211 |  maybe taking a backward step, 10-15 yards,
[6957.48 - 6960.60] P:1469.48 E:0.035283 |  letting them play along the back, Chelsea the same.
[6960.60 - 6961.88] P:1590.07 E:0.044910 |  So it will be very KG.
[6962.68 - 6965.56] P:1337.29 E:0.043122 |  But this is again, when people like Cristiano Ronaldo
[6965.56 - 6968.04] P:1307.61 E:0.041409 |  need to step up in that final third, do his magic.
[6968.60 - 6971.40] P:1371.45 E:0.040384 |  And at the other end, Joe Cole has been at a quiet game,
[6971.40 - 6973.72] P:1368.37 E:0.040340 |  but again, just little glimpses that perhaps he could be
[6973.88 - 6975.72] P:1372.49 E:0.038461 |  potential match winner for Chelsea as well.
[6977.96 - 6981.64] P:1321.65 E:0.047146 |  Well, there's the toss of the coin being made at the moment.
[6981.64 - 6986.12] P:1376.46 E:0.041347 |  We always have quite some time these days after the full-time.
[6986.12 - 6990.76] P:1418.28 E:0.043786 |  We saw Ryan Giggs, obviously, full of purpose going over to the ball now.
[6991.40 - 6994.20] P:1326.51 E:0.043168 |  And very interesting this, isn't it?
[6994.20 - 6997.64] P:1427.54 E:0.045191 |  I mean, we talked all week about the shades of Munich,
[6998.52 - 7001.72] P:1303.60 E:0.042887 |  and 50 years on from that disaster.
[7001.96 - 7005.48] P:1592.09 E:0.035054 |  40 years on from Wembley, an extra time,
[7006.12 - 7009.40] P:1526.58 E:0.036405 |  when Manchester United, of course, went on so well to win it.
[7009.40 - 7010.04] P:1416.74 E:0.044227 |  Absolutely.
[7011.56 - 7012.68] P:1425.90 E:0.051385 |  Full, really.
[7012.68 - 7014.92] P:1449.78 E:0.045410 |  Chelsea, of course, as well, winning that European Cup,
[7014.92 - 7019.40] P:1404.79 E:0.042636 |  winning this Cup against Real Madrid, 37 years ago, pretty much to the day.
[7020.52 - 7022.76] P:1230.23 E:0.048345 |  All the fans here like to say it's hard to believe, isn't it?
[7022.76 - 7023.96] P:1369.51 E:0.044879 |  22-1 in the morning.
[7024.92 - 7029.64] P:1673.16 E:0.038608 |  Well, 40 years ago, it was Manchester United against Ben Fika,
[7029.64 - 7031.32] P:1520.73 E:0.034028 |  the side from Portugal.
[7031.40 - 7033.96] P:1551.98 E:0.040868 |  Chelsea don't have a Portuguese manager anymore,
[7033.96 - 7038.20] P:1540.08 E:0.032635 |  but Manchester United may well have a Portuguese match winner.
[7038.20 - 7038.76] P:1560.75 E:0.046757 |  Alan Green.
[7040.76 - 7044.68] P:1456.02 E:0.039823 |  Well, a minute before halftime, I wouldn't have bet anything on extra time.
[7045.48 - 7049.16] P:1744.82 E:0.038255 |  Until that fortunate equaliser for Chelsea,
[7050.04 - 7053.08] P:1523.90 E:0.041138 |  you know, a double ricochet, a ball breaking the lampard,
[7054.44 - 7055.88] P:1259.41 E:0.035554 |  it was all united.
[7055.88 - 7056.60] P:1188.42 E:0.047956 |  All united.
[7056.60 - 7058.36] P:1592.40 E:0.050218 |  Certainly on the evidence of the first half,
[7058.36 - 7061.64] P:1566.29 E:0.034989 |  you thought it isn't going to go into extra time.
[7061.64 - 7064.36] P:1257.51 E:0.041877 |  Yet, having said that, and before a ball was kicked,
[7064.36 - 7067.72] P:1297.02 E:0.039052 |  I don't think coming into extra time has surprised any of us.
[7067.72 - 7070.60] P:1525.33 E:0.039264 |  I think that first 45 minutes certainly thought,
[7070.60 - 7071.96] P:1469.28 E:0.043745 |  well, there'll be no extra time here.
[7072.52 - 7075.48] P:1306.86 E:0.042456 |  But the fact that there is, I don't think is a total surprise.
[7075.48 - 7079.00] P:1352.46 E:0.039405 |  It won't surprise me if it finishes like this, either.
[7079.00 - 7081.64] P:1329.03 E:0.032942 |  And we then have the business of penalties.
[7081.64 - 7083.56] P:1421.68 E:0.046019 |  Ah, well, we're going to have a change.
[7084.28 - 7088.12] P:1557.77 E:0.036094 |  Caloo is coming on, presumably, for Maluda.
[7088.12 - 7089.08] P:1402.07 E:0.030887 |  No, Maluda is there.
[7090.60 - 7093.24] P:1415.70 E:0.035866 |  So what do you reckon is going to happen here?
[7093.24 - 7094.76] P:1582.58 E:0.045952 |  Caloo, seriously coming on.
[7094.76 - 7098.68] P:1413.04 E:0.037234 |  To a particular moment, there's no sign of the change now.
[7098.68 - 7101.08] P:1636.05 E:0.042513 |  Now, look, Caloo stripped off,
[7102.60 - 7105.08] P:1623.37 E:0.041640 |  but the first period of extra time has begun.
[7106.20 - 7109.56] P:1497.55 E:0.037977 |  With the same personnel that ended normal time.
[7109.56 - 7112.76] P:1633.78 E:0.036445 |  In other words, the only change in the game was gigs on for Scoles.
[7113.64 - 7115.48] P:1726.66 E:0.043209 |  Here's Carrick from Manchester United.
[7115.48 - 7118.84] P:1572.56 E:0.028799 |  Back to the Dix that are attacking.
[7120.60 - 7123.00] P:1583.97 E:0.043462 |  The Anto are right in the spirit of extra time.
[7123.00 - 7125.88] P:1538.01 E:0.038314 |  That's the end into which Ronaldo headed them in front.
[7127.16 - 7128.76] P:1527.52 E:0.030943 |  Rooney back to Brian.
[7129.48 - 7132.04] P:1525.47 E:0.036207 |  And now, Ferdinand has become really chilly,
[7132.04 - 7135.08] P:1474.34 E:0.033560 |  but it is 20 when it's tomorrow in the morning.
[7135.96 - 7139.16] P:1553.03 E:0.044465 |  And 6 0 6 will follow on 5 live.
[7139.72 - 7141.40] P:1580.54 E:0.041657 |  Any sensible conclusion here?
[7142.60 - 7144.36] P:1420.41 E:0.050518 |  We're going to get the flight at 7 a.m.
[7145.80 - 7147.64] P:1418.01 E:0.048624 |  So I start walking now to the airport.
[7147.64 - 7149.64] P:1288.91 E:0.043325 |  Well, I think what we're looking at,
[7149.64 - 7152.28] P:1650.79 E:0.042389 |  you may because it started very slowly.
[7152.28 - 7153.56] P:1504.68 E:0.042399 |  Yeah, caution, caution.
[7153.56 - 7154.52] P:1333.33 E:0.032707 |  Very slowly indeed.
[7155.16 - 7158.84] P:1545.94 E:0.035927 |  Well, you know, he's thinking of making the change in extra time.
[7158.84 - 7161.08] P:1559.58 E:0.038492 |  I don't know why he didn't make it the start of extra time.
[7161.72 - 7164.68] P:1469.26 E:0.031143 |  That's how from Grant, Caloo will be coming on.
[7164.68 - 7167.96] P:1589.04 E:0.036724 |  Giggs with the ball upfield, easily cleared by Esi.
[7168.60 - 7171.16] P:1517.65 E:0.042912 |  Hargreaves definitely in a central midfield roll now.
[7171.16 - 7173.80] P:1569.40 E:0.032894 |  To Ronaldo, back to Evra, into Tevez.
[7173.80 - 7176.92] P:1618.94 E:0.034558 |  Tevez, centre of the Chelsea half to Michael Carrick.
[7177.48 - 7179.16] P:1611.52 E:0.044996 |  Carrick slid them all forward to Giggs.
[7179.16 - 7180.68] P:1726.53 E:0.037550 |  Under Tevez, promising.
[7180.68 - 7183.64] P:1658.03 E:0.037146 |  Tevez is there, but so too is checked as they tried to
[7184.44 - 7186.68] P:1768.63 E:0.041464 |  pass the way into the penalty area,
[7186.68 - 7188.68] P:1735.74 E:0.042409 |  pass the way into a goal opportunity.
[7188.68 - 7190.60] P:1622.75 E:0.047780 |  I think they're a little bit unlucky there.
[7190.60 - 7192.52] P:1701.09 E:0.035331 |  I'm not so certain about the Chelsea defender
[7192.52 - 7194.84] P:1471.95 E:0.031534 |  whether his intention was doing intercept or not,
[7194.84 - 7197.08] P:1092.54 E:0.051222 |  but a lovely 1-2 by Rooney and Tevez.
[7197.64 - 7198.68] P:1458.24 E:0.040584 |  Some good play there.
[7199.64 - 7203.24] P:1603.93 E:0.035629 |  Biric, heads checks clearance to the halfway line,
[7203.24 - 7205.64] P:1350.17 E:0.034602 |  then it's headed out by Giggs for a throw,
[7205.64 - 7207.08] P:1590.48 E:0.037074 |  and here comes the Chelsea change.
[7207.88 - 7211.40] P:1522.40 E:0.038402 |  And it is the change I anticipated.
[7211.40 - 7213.80] P:1629.26 E:0.042171 |  I just don't understand why it wasn't made two minutes ago.
[7213.80 - 7215.00] P:1715.48 E:0.039464 |  That is strange, isn't it?
[7215.00 - 7217.56] P:1548.87 E:0.044923 |  It is Malouda who comes off and Caloo goes on.
[7218.92 - 7221.80] P:1611.78 E:0.042444 |  And straight away, of course, Caloo takes up that left
[7222.68 - 7228.36] P:1584.21 E:0.030507 |  attacking position of the sort of two players behind Drogba.
[7228.44 - 7232.12] P:1615.36 E:0.037698 |  Ronaldo attacking down the other flank from Manchester United.
[7232.12 - 7233.72] P:1538.52 E:0.039333 |  And Ronaldo running at Essian.
[7233.72 - 7235.40] P:1600.50 E:0.035868 |  Essian gets in a challenge.
[7235.40 - 7237.72] P:1391.93 E:0.038962 |  I think he may have back healed the ball into Ronaldo,
[7237.72 - 7239.72] P:1535.74 E:0.032018 |  and it's out for a throw into Chelsea.
[7239.72 - 7240.92] P:1713.73 E:0.050095 |  To be fair to Essian then,
[7240.92 - 7243.56] P:1785.93 E:0.037451 |  when Ronaldo started to stretch him with a run,
[7243.56 - 7245.88] P:1676.44 E:0.033515 |  he stuck with him and he's strong and powerful.
[7245.88 - 7248.44] P:1274.94 E:0.040225 |  And I think he's done as well as he could do,
[7248.44 - 7251.56] P:1512.87 E:0.037091 |  playing in the position, which isn't really his natural position.
[7251.56 - 7254.76] P:1428.02 E:0.039291 |  A number of Chelsea players I thought in the second half,
[7254.76 - 7256.60] P:1581.47 E:0.036474 |  came on. Essian did.
[7256.60 - 7258.92] P:1509.82 E:0.038632 |  Joe Cole started to show much more.
[7258.92 - 7260.68] P:1462.43 E:0.035333 |  Frank Lampard, Michael Ballak.
[7260.68 - 7264.12] P:1466.46 E:0.032572 |  But they could hardly play as an athlete in the second half,
[7264.12 - 7266.04] P:1467.59 E:0.028115 |  as they certainly played in the first.
[7266.04 - 7268.52] P:1621.62 E:0.040065 |  One-one here, an extra time here in Moscow.
[7269.64 - 7273.32] P:1603.12 E:0.036744 |  Referee's decided there's an offense against John Terrian.
[7273.32 - 7275.48] P:1625.05 E:0.032753 |  He's awarded a free kick to Chelsea.
[7276.20 - 7279.88] P:1436.07 E:0.028663 |  Just, well, certainly wasn't there,
[7279.88 - 7282.84] P:1510.07 E:0.040852 |  but McElloy takes it and is allowed to take it close to the halfway line.
[7282.84 - 7284.12] P:1642.17 E:0.038968 |  On it goes to Caloo.
[7284.12 - 7286.44] P:1698.84 E:0.037002 |  Brown is there, gets a toe to the ball,
[7286.44 - 7289.00] P:1663.07 E:0.035058 |  it's out of play and it's a throw in to Chelsea.
[7289.00 - 7290.76] P:1592.78 E:0.035222 |  Three minutes of extra time have been played.
[7292.52 - 7293.96] P:1591.68 E:0.042795 |  Ashley Cole to take the throw in.
[7294.84 - 7297.24] P:1487.38 E:0.037992 |  Ballak lurking just outside the penalty here.
[7297.80 - 7300.20] P:1592.72 E:0.034781 |  Cole throws to Caloo.
[7300.20 - 7303.24] P:1670.34 E:0.037875 |  And Caloo into Ashley Cole again, into the penalty here,
[7303.24 - 7306.04] P:1592.42 E:0.038537 |  tries to slide it back, chance for Ballak, Lampard.
[7306.04 - 7307.00] P:1679.46 E:0.039006 |  They all want to shoot.
[7307.00 - 7308.44] P:1507.01 E:0.046336 |  Lampard hit the crossbar.
[7308.44 - 7312.28] P:1373.88 E:0.042856 |  Cole hit the guard up over the crossbar, behind for a goal kick.
[7312.28 - 7314.84] P:1528.27 E:0.031346 |  That's twice Chelsea have hit the woodwork.
[7314.84 - 7319.64] P:1606.09 E:0.041515 |  Well, as much as Chelsea were lucky to equalise just before half-time,
[7319.64 - 7323.88] P:1613.85 E:0.040046 |  Manchester United have been fortunate with first drug-burying normal time.
[7324.84 - 7327.16] P:1459.79 E:0.046551 |  And now Joe Cole hitting the woodwork.
[7328.04 - 7331.16] P:1557.77 E:0.033645 |  I didn't understand why Ballak didn't should have go.
[7332.28 - 7334.28] P:1393.26 E:0.040677 |  And he also actually let the ball to Lampard.
[7335.16 - 7337.24] P:1600.92 E:0.044265 |  Here is Lampard again, in towards drug bar.
[7337.24 - 7341.00] P:1552.44 E:0.033657 |  Drug bar can't pick up possession though and it's played by Vittic.
[7341.08 - 7342.52] P:1679.04 E:0.035687 |  And that's loose from Carrick.
[7343.08 - 7344.68] P:1552.40 E:0.038821 |  And then Ronaldo steps in.
[7344.68 - 7345.72] P:1491.78 E:0.041812 |  Winter ball back.
[7345.72 - 7347.48] P:1598.55 E:0.038447 |  Well done, Cristiano Ronaldo.
[7347.48 - 7349.24] P:1633.23 E:0.036286 |  Sprinting down this near touch line.
[7349.24 - 7350.28] P:1686.69 E:0.031410 |  United right.
[7350.28 - 7351.24] P:1655.31 E:0.038152 |  Onto Rooney.
[7351.24 - 7352.68] P:1604.42 E:0.041151 |  Rooney back to Ronaldo.
[7352.68 - 7354.20] P:1615.36 E:0.039713 |  Running away from McAleely.
[7354.20 - 7355.24] P:1521.77 E:0.038713 |  Is the cross good enough?
[7355.24 - 7356.36] P:1469.05 E:0.038063 |  Into Wolff-Trevbers.
[7356.36 - 7359.40] P:1548.06 E:0.031679 |  Headed clear by Carvalho.
[7359.96 - 7362.68] P:1547.12 E:0.049203 |  Ever on the far side of the field or the referee spotting a foul?
[7363.48 - 7364.68] P:1667.79 E:0.042751 |  By Ryan Giggs.
[7364.68 - 7366.12] P:1809.36 E:0.027528 |  That's a free kick for Chelsea.
[7366.12 - 7370.36] P:1760.53 E:0.038409 |  There's been this talk about Ronaldo having to perform on the big games.
[7370.36 - 7373.16] P:1694.10 E:0.034905 |  He's performing this game, there's no doubt about that.
[7373.16 - 7374.68] P:1651.24 E:0.035253 |  It's a fantastic run.
[7374.68 - 7376.04] P:1673.95 E:0.042206 |  A strong run by him.
[7376.04 - 7378.12] P:1428.28 E:0.028239 |  Good delivery, good end delivery.
[7378.12 - 7381.16] P:1575.52 E:0.041241 |  And he's proving some of the, let's say not critics,
[7381.16 - 7383.88] P:1662.07 E:0.034969 |  but some of the people of question, can he deliver?
[7383.88 - 7386.20] P:1442.72 E:0.037926 |  I think on this particular game he certainly has done.
[7386.20 - 7387.56] P:1547.68 E:0.046175 |  He's being United's best foul.
[7387.56 - 7388.60] P:1414.73 E:0.046730 |  Crockwood also well.
[7388.60 - 7389.64] P:1489.90 E:0.041595 |  Where's the ball on the air?
[7389.64 - 7391.40] P:1657.79 E:0.035228 |  Joke hole, and dies.
[7392.60 - 7395.56] P:1733.86 E:0.043229 |  That's why he didn't get the free kick, joke hole, because it was a dive.
[7396.84 - 7398.60] P:1705.04 E:0.040558 |  It's not just the foreigners who died.
[7399.16 - 7400.76] P:1693.71 E:0.037824 |  England players do it as well.
[7400.76 - 7402.84] P:1772.58 E:0.041442 |  Cole has done it at the moment as if he's injured.
[7403.56 - 7404.44] P:1651.34 E:0.040800 |  I don't know.
[7404.44 - 7405.56] P:1627.95 E:0.038455 |  Play continues.
[7405.56 - 7408.76] P:1660.02 E:0.040649 |  Michael Carrick back to Hargreaves.
[7409.56 - 7410.92] P:1568.80 E:0.047393 |  Hargreaves on to Tevez.
[7410.92 - 7412.52] P:1543.50 E:0.040903 |  They're going to put the ball out of play.
[7412.52 - 7412.92] P:1557.62 E:0.046536 |  They are.
[7414.60 - 7417.88] P:1829.03 E:0.046725 |  Joke hole will receive treatment necessary all the way.
[7417.88 - 7419.56] P:1968.21 E:0.045367 |  I've said this a number of times.
[7419.56 - 7421.56] P:1938.32 E:0.036241 |  I know it puts pressure on the referee.
[7421.56 - 7424.92] P:1971.12 E:0.041813 |  I don't believe it's up to the players to kick the ball out at all.
[7424.92 - 7427.72] P:1901.65 E:0.035596 |  I think the referee must decide when play stops,
[7427.72 - 7430.36] P:1812.75 E:0.034477 |  and then that will cover up all of this business.
[7431.24 - 7435.32] P:1709.86 E:0.039332 |  It ought to be known that it will be the referee that decides when play stops.
[7435.32 - 7439.48] P:1719.18 E:0.040175 |  This is the 14th European Cup or Champions League final.
[7439.48 - 7440.76] P:1867.95 E:0.037007 |  It's gone to extra time.
[7441.72 - 7445.64] P:1805.60 E:0.036916 |  And I repeat, four of the previous 15 Champions League finals
[7445.64 - 7447.88] P:1530.17 E:0.037298 |  required penalty shootouts to decide the winner.
[7449.40 - 7454.52] P:1538.43 E:0.039427 |  Famously in Istanbul, when Liverpool overcame AC Milan,
[7455.00 - 7459.32] P:1754.17 E:0.040838 |  and also back in 2000, I remember Mike and I were sitting at Old Trafford,
[7459.32 - 7460.76] P:1858.88 E:0.044317 |  AC Milan and Juventus.
[7463.32 - 7465.80] P:1922.87 E:0.051569 |  I tell you what, there are a few of the local militia
[7465.80 - 7469.56] P:1983.11 E:0.039922 |  who are donning Manchester United shirts in the crowd.
[7470.60 - 7472.04] P:1917.37 E:0.047080 |  And when the United Goldwoods did,
[7472.04 - 7475.32] P:1828.94 E:0.037421 |  there were four very young girls, clearly Russians,
[7477.08 - 7479.56] P:1775.18 E:0.040986 |  who had sort of steward bibs on,
[7479.56 - 7483.08] P:1648.50 E:0.037948 |  and they went absolutely delirious when Ronaldo
[7483.08 - 7485.24] P:1600.83 E:0.033844 |  headed United right in front of us.
[7486.28 - 7487.40] P:1469.82 E:0.035198 |  Doing their jobs, of course.
[7488.68 - 7491.96] P:1707.01 E:0.045095 |  Right, Joe Cole's okay, back on the pitch,
[7492.76 - 7497.32] P:1821.22 E:0.035640 |  he knew he would be, and United get back possession,
[7497.32 - 7499.24] P:1545.65 E:0.040234 |  admittedly deep inside their own half.
[7499.24 - 7501.80] P:1709.09 E:0.035985 |  Well, that squandered at least a minute of extra time.
[7501.80 - 7504.52] P:1408.04 E:0.040447 |  They'll have to be added on at the end of the first 15.
[7504.52 - 7505.48] P:1613.10 E:0.051260 |  Here's Van Dysart.
[7506.76 - 7508.60] P:1606.59 E:0.038426 |  Van Dysart, right footed.
[7509.24 - 7510.92] P:1655.77 E:0.045996 |  I'm just wondering if it's raining out there now.
[7511.00 - 7513.32] P:1341.42 E:0.037263 |  There are a few brawlies that have been put up.
[7513.32 - 7514.52] P:1634.28 E:0.034003 |  In fact, I'm sure it's raining.
[7515.56 - 7517.96] P:1443.33 E:0.036424 |  Otherwise, it's been a horrible day in Moscow.
[7517.96 - 7521.48] P:1428.26 E:0.036546 |  Gray wet most of the time and increasingly cold.
[7521.48 - 7524.36] P:1592.70 E:0.037177 |  Here's Cavalio Poccelli taking the ball well in his chest.
[7524.36 - 7526.52] P:1496.77 E:0.038100 |  Cavalio trying to run away from Tevez.
[7526.52 - 7529.00] P:1700.66 E:0.039009 |  Tevez did well, got in the challenge, won the ball.
[7529.88 - 7531.24] P:1660.64 E:0.027484 |  Carrick to gigs.
[7531.24 - 7533.08] P:1721.86 E:0.032708 |  Excellent pass to Rooney.
[7533.08 - 7536.52] P:1602.97 E:0.034460 |  And Rooney then tackled by Ashley Cole and Ashley Cole.
[7536.52 - 7538.36] P:1656.82 E:0.040319 |  Rooney was looking for support down the right side,
[7538.36 - 7539.56] P:1423.16 E:0.025606 |  and it wasn't forthcoming.
[7539.56 - 7540.76] P:1707.56 E:0.033107 |  Brome was too deep.
[7540.76 - 7542.92] P:1594.15 E:0.040264 |  Here's Cologne getting away from Brome.
[7542.92 - 7544.44] P:1627.05 E:0.037210 |  This is promising for Chelsea.
[7544.44 - 7545.88] P:1640.70 E:0.034195 |  Essian's in a great position.
[7545.88 - 7548.28] P:1602.63 E:0.039925 |  Play to Michael Essian into the penalty area.
[7548.84 - 7551.48] P:1617.73 E:0.038621 |  Oh, well, it's knocked behind by Carrick for a corner.
[7552.44 - 7555.48] P:1705.24 E:0.039065 |  Essian couldn't really create the room for a shot and goal
[7555.48 - 7557.24] P:1612.33 E:0.036895 |  and didn't think of a pass to a colleague.
[7557.80 - 7559.48] P:1728.12 E:0.039815 |  But I would say Essian there.
[7559.48 - 7562.60] P:1786.42 E:0.043082 |  He's done a 50-yard run to get up into possession.
[7562.60 - 7565.32] P:1849.20 E:0.039104 |  I mean, he's bombing up and down that right-hand side.
[7565.32 - 7567.96] P:1853.08 E:0.036637 |  He's very much almost like the midfield player.
[7568.04 - 7570.84] P:1865.61 E:0.040812 |  Wasn't quite able to get the finishing touch with,
[7570.84 - 7572.84] P:1797.74 E:0.040296 |  but he's still won his side of corner.
[7572.84 - 7574.20] P:1682.41 E:0.035930 |  Lampard from the right.
[7574.84 - 7577.16] P:1743.60 E:0.040422 |  Terry Cavalio and Balak, wait.
[7577.16 - 7579.80] P:1520.48 E:0.039256 |  It's headed down by Cavalio, well wide of goal,
[7579.80 - 7582.60] P:1519.62 E:0.029453 |  and it's trundling behind for a goal kick.
[7583.48 - 7585.96] P:1623.14 E:0.043886 |  Look at this little ritual that John Terry has.
[7585.96 - 7591.00] P:1621.61 E:0.038864 |  Every time there's a corner for his team or a free kick near a goal,
[7591.00 - 7593.16] P:1674.28 E:0.039593 |  he always pulls up his sock.
[7593.16 - 7594.84] P:1577.51 E:0.037523 |  By the way, Nicholas Snellk is coming on.
[7595.16 - 7598.92] P:1444.23 E:0.033321 |  He's replacing Joe Cole.
[7598.92 - 7600.12] P:1319.39 E:0.028023 |  Joe Cole coming off, yeah.
[7602.36 - 7603.00] P:1501.34 E:0.057340 |  Joe Cole.
[7604.04 - 7605.56] P:1823.86 E:0.050865 |  I'm sure he's not into Joe Cole.
[7606.60 - 7607.56] P:1904.73 E:0.047606 |  Just being taken off.
[7608.68 - 7610.84] P:1898.91 E:0.046997 |  Chelsea fans don't like to see Joe Cole taken off.
[7612.04 - 7612.76] P:1753.48 E:0.048111 |  Don't like that.
[7613.32 - 7615.08] P:1792.72 E:0.043157 |  But I wonder if this is a change of formation,
[7615.08 - 7617.72] P:1551.25 E:0.039343 |  and will Anelka just occupy that right-wing berth?
[7619.08 - 7620.60] P:1344.33 E:0.048660 |  And that's where he's going in a moment,
[7620.60 - 7622.12] P:1403.62 E:0.040466 |  away towards the far side.
[7622.12 - 7623.00] P:1618.24 E:0.032180 |  Same formation.
[7623.00 - 7625.08] P:1505.16 E:0.037546 |  So no change in the formation.
[7625.08 - 7626.52] P:1603.67 E:0.045177 |  So they've changed the two players,
[7627.64 - 7630.60] P:1283.61 E:0.028693 |  has Avro Grant behind Drogba.
[7630.60 - 7633.00] P:1500.28 E:0.040514 |  He's taken off Maluda and Joe Cole,
[7633.56 - 7636.28] P:1524.54 E:0.030531 |  and now it's Colou and Anelka.
[7636.28 - 7637.64] P:1480.49 E:0.043228 |  And here is the set of Anelka.
[7638.20 - 7640.60] P:1538.62 E:0.039934 |  Sure, he's not fond of a wide midfield position,
[7640.60 - 7642.76] P:1589.42 E:0.041536 |  but he passes it to Asien onto Anelka.
[7643.32 - 7645.40] P:1615.40 E:0.038141 |  And he tried to run into the defender and went a throw,
[7645.40 - 7647.72] P:1596.64 E:0.036910 |  and he didn't, and it's out for a United throw,
[7648.44 - 7650.12] P:1444.34 E:0.031504 |  which is taken by Terry.
[7650.12 - 7652.84] P:1533.67 E:0.038845 |  And Nani's about to come on from Manchester United.
[7653.96 - 7655.96] P:1486.41 E:0.034183 |  Ball is back with Vande Zarr.
[7656.92 - 7659.32] P:1542.59 E:0.036894 |  Well, we've had a couple of incidents,
[7660.52 - 7662.92] P:1601.49 E:0.040033 |  potential goals in the first bit of extra time.
[7662.92 - 7665.56] P:1583.05 E:0.039326 |  My concern always is when it goes into the second period,
[7665.56 - 7668.84] P:1791.45 E:0.034319 |  they're so nervous, so anxious not to make an error,
[7668.84 - 7671.24] P:1559.79 E:0.034924 |  that we inevitably head for spot kicks.
[7672.12 - 7675.16] P:1474.15 E:0.040990 |  But what we're seeing even with Manchester United at the moment,
[7675.16 - 7677.48] P:1502.51 E:0.042029 |  they're playing very safe football at the moment.
[7678.20 - 7681.48] P:1593.64 E:0.036327 |  Here's Rooney, certainly not playing as a striker,
[7681.48 - 7684.84] P:1433.65 E:0.039091 |  he's wide midfield, back to Ferdinand onto Rooney again.
[7684.84 - 7687.40] P:1490.97 E:0.036155 |  He's on a couple of yards inside the Chelsea half.
[7687.40 - 7689.96] P:1633.64 E:0.037272 |  He hits it high, crossfield, right to left.
[7689.96 - 7692.44] P:1457.87 E:0.037560 |  Asien heads it away before Anelka picking up,
[7692.44 - 7694.76] P:1615.83 E:0.040523 |  but Evera picks it up, great run by Evera.
[7694.76 - 7697.64] P:1495.95 E:0.043735 |  Is this the winner? Oh my goodness, what a chance!
[7697.64 - 7699.72] P:1476.50 E:0.045256 |  What an opportunity for Ryan Ging.
[7699.72 - 7700.28] P:1481.87 E:0.044077 |  John Terry.
[7700.28 - 7702.60] P:1631.18 E:0.034781 |  And shot, hit, I think, an offender,
[7702.60 - 7705.96] P:1565.34 E:0.037628 |  and loops over the crossbar, but Ging should have buried it.
[7705.96 - 7707.64] P:1672.84 E:0.042983 |  Right, absolutely right there.
[7707.64 - 7709.48] P:1765.16 E:0.036552 |  But I think, I don't know whether it's hitting,
[7709.48 - 7713.00] P:1463.13 E:0.039631 |  whether John Terry brought off some great defending, I thought, Alan.
[7713.00 - 7714.76] P:1458.18 E:0.046971 |  I think John Terry got in the way of it,
[7714.76 - 7716.52] P:1440.92 E:0.038055 |  more than Ging's hitting him with the ball.
[7716.52 - 7718.44] P:1681.03 E:0.031587 |  If so, it's fantastic defending.
[7718.44 - 7719.72] P:1652.25 E:0.038927 |  Yeah, but Ging should have scored.
[7720.76 - 7723.48] P:1669.30 E:0.039517 |  Five minutes to go in the first period of extra time.
[7723.48 - 7724.84] P:1555.21 E:0.039915 |  Ging's with the corner left footed.
[7724.84 - 7728.04] P:1603.42 E:0.039456 |  In swinging, great defending, that was by Denier Droga,
[7728.04 - 7729.80] P:1618.13 E:0.031552 |  he was being fouled at the same instant.
[7730.68 - 7734.20] P:1560.41 E:0.031704 |  Vittic was trying to get his head to the ball, and it's a free kick.
[7734.20 - 7736.04] P:1519.97 E:0.041420 |  Here, we're just getting a replay of it.
[7736.12 - 7741.48] P:1503.69 E:0.037870 |  Evera, I don't know, I don't know whether Terry deliberately got his body in the way.
[7741.48 - 7745.56] P:1718.93 E:0.039176 |  He got it away with his head, but it was weak from Ging's.
[7745.56 - 7746.36] P:1861.95 E:0.034409 |  Weak from Ging's.
[7746.36 - 7747.00] P:1757.91 E:0.036563 |  Don't call him.
[7747.00 - 7748.28] P:1724.40 E:0.040212 |  That was top-class defending.
[7748.28 - 7750.20] P:1704.44 E:0.042751 |  He just saved, backstriker's winning downs.
[7750.20 - 7753.56] P:1550.14 E:0.045659 |  Cristiano Ronaldo just seen Ray Bruny come off the nanny.
[7753.56 - 7756.60] P:1800.73 E:0.036449 |  That was world-class defending for him from John Terry.
[7756.60 - 7760.12] P:1864.20 E:0.033904 |  He was on the back foot, he's footing had gone,
[7760.12 - 7761.96] P:1931.14 E:0.033932 |  and he still managed to just prick his neck
[7761.96 - 7763.24] P:1589.45 E:0.047110 |  and get the header over the bar.
[7763.24 - 7764.76] P:1250.90 E:0.031240 |  Wonderful defending for him.
[7764.84 - 7766.52] P:1443.27 E:0.035949 |  Well, former England captain.
[7767.16 - 7770.28] P:1600.72 E:0.031840 |  Well, I don't think Bruny's too pleased to have been taken off,
[7770.28 - 7772.28] P:1487.90 E:0.036446 |  but then he hasn't had the best of evenings, frankly.
[7772.92 - 7774.28] P:1537.11 E:0.044073 |  No, he's not pleasant.
[7774.28 - 7777.24] P:1666.39 E:0.038878 |  And this formation, preferably, of 4-2-3-1,
[7777.80 - 7780.60] P:1465.37 E:0.040739 |  nannies are more appropriate player to be on the field than Bruny.
[7783.08 - 7784.68] P:1387.89 E:0.043098 |  I know Mike was talking before the game,
[7784.68 - 7787.16] P:1729.93 E:0.041436 |  maybe this is Bruny's stage, well, it hasn't proved so.
[7787.16 - 7790.20] P:1570.48 E:0.036064 |  And of course, now he won't be involved in any penalty kicks,
[7790.20 - 7791.40] P:1750.23 E:0.041311 |  should we get that far.
[7792.04 - 7795.80] P:1471.56 E:0.034874 |  And at the moment, we're 19 minutes of football away from penalty kicks.
[7796.36 - 7798.68] P:1611.11 E:0.037404 |  Approaching the end of the first period of extra time.
[7798.68 - 7800.84] P:1613.71 E:0.038794 |  Manchester United won, Chelsea won.
[7801.72 - 7805.00] P:1524.58 E:0.037031 |  Here's Colud, doing well, getting the ball back to Ashley Cole.
[7805.00 - 7807.16] P:1385.75 E:0.042450 |  And into McAleely, over the halfway line.
[7807.16 - 7809.48] P:1560.06 E:0.036296 |  Raric scarce from upfield for McAleely.
[7809.48 - 7811.64] P:1608.71 E:0.034188 |  Pearl pass, awful pass.
[7811.64 - 7815.32] P:1616.59 E:0.036729 |  Straight to Ronaldo, and Ronaldo can counterattack from Manchester United.
[7815.32 - 7818.20] P:1606.86 E:0.038266 |  He's got gigs on Tevez, he finds the Argentine,
[7818.28 - 7820.68] P:1640.97 E:0.041019 |  Carlos Tevez, rolling forward, into the penalty,
[7820.68 - 7822.60] P:1810.03 E:0.035021 |  checked on his right foot, should straighter check.
[7823.64 - 7826.44] P:1804.31 E:0.045956 |  Yeah, once he stepped it back inside on that right foot,
[7826.44 - 7829.80] P:1655.22 E:0.041984 |  I thought he needed to look up because he got support in the box.
[7830.52 - 7832.60] P:1637.92 E:0.039121 |  He went for power straight at him,
[7833.64 - 7835.40] P:1712.88 E:0.039732 |  and didn't really trouble check at all.
[7835.40 - 7837.24] P:1274.30 E:0.035317 |  I thought he could have done better there.
[7837.24 - 7840.60] P:1255.35 E:0.037427 |  Lampard gave McAleely a right roll-on for that error.
[7840.60 - 7842.28] P:1376.64 E:0.030533 |  That could have been very costly.
[7842.28 - 7845.56] P:1590.33 E:0.038903 |  Now Chelsea on the attack now, oh, well played, Colud.
[7846.28 - 7849.64] P:1677.29 E:0.041088 |  I thought he got the throwing, but it's not, goes to Manchester United.
[7849.64 - 7854.04] P:1614.53 E:0.033115 |  Nani, back heel to Hargreaves, and now Carrick, onto Tevez.
[7854.60 - 7859.32] P:1488.88 E:0.037700 |  Tevez on the halfway line, simple little pass, didn't find Ronaldo,
[7859.32 - 7863.48] P:1681.75 E:0.041042 |  and it's taken forward by Esion, though Ripley decides that Esion has fallen.
[7863.48 - 7866.44] P:1764.92 E:0.038088 |  Tevez to get the ball, and it's a free kick to Manchester United.
[7868.28 - 7870.44] P:1624.40 E:0.036115 |  Taken by Hargreaves to Carrick.
[7871.64 - 7873.64] P:1556.22 E:0.040530 |  And now here's Ronaldo again.
[7874.52 - 7877.56] P:1557.76 E:0.038687 |  Tevez is through the middle at the moment for those in red.
[7878.84 - 7884.84] P:1667.28 E:0.037095 |  That's given away by Manchester United, and here's Colud, who gives it away as well to Carrick.
[7884.84 - 7889.00] P:1615.95 E:0.034240 |  Taken up by Nani, done the right flank, a yard in from the touch line.
[7889.64 - 7893.00] P:1565.62 E:0.035694 |  Beats Ashley Cole has to play the ball back though to Carrick.
[7893.56 - 7895.32] P:1590.62 E:0.042886 |  Carrick onto Nani again.
[7895.32 - 7898.76] P:1487.05 E:0.039110 |  That was a hand ball by Ashley Cole, spotter with the linesman,
[7898.76 - 7901.00] P:1542.26 E:0.038136 |  and not given, and then Nani wasted.
[7901.00 - 7902.84] P:1688.34 E:0.036560 |  And now he protests to the referee.
[7902.84 - 7906.36] P:1761.43 E:0.038190 |  I think because it came back to him, they said, look, you've got the advantage.
[7906.36 - 7907.24] P:1516.94 E:0.035283 |  Do something with it.
[7908.36 - 7911.00] P:1670.03 E:0.039306 |  90 seconds remain of the first period of extra time.
[7911.00 - 7912.84] P:1524.23 E:0.036169 |  Manchester United won, Chelsea won.
[7912.84 - 7915.80] P:1614.58 E:0.037526 |  The lines are open, of course, with 6-0-6,
[7915.80 - 7921.00] P:1457.07 E:0.044799 |  which I'll be presenting into heaven only knows what are here in Russia.
[7922.36 - 7924.60] P:1537.16 E:0.046851 |  0-500-9-0-9-6-9-3.
[7926.04 - 7927.56] P:1564.12 E:0.038563 |  Check with a goal kick.
[7927.56 - 7929.96] P:1458.93 E:0.038082 |  Vernon jumps the drug, but neither of them make contact.
[7929.96 - 7932.68] P:1643.84 E:0.038046 |  Piddington's there, almost put a possession by Kalu.
[7932.68 - 7936.36] P:1498.00 E:0.030254 |  And then the linesman has flied, I think, for a foot up, was it?
[7936.36 - 7937.48] P:1353.67 E:0.043106 |  It was either foot or fore.
[7937.48 - 7942.20] P:1442.28 E:0.033906 |  He was trying to, you know, his hands went up in the air and probably hit his hands there.
[7942.20 - 7943.64] P:1530.84 E:0.046724 |  Something of that, either way to defend.
[7943.64 - 7944.68] P:1782.76 E:0.044290 |  Still a risk, wasn't it?
[7945.48 - 7947.56] P:1656.40 E:0.044805 |  Yeah, he's a bit sluggish to get there, Piddington.
[7948.36 - 7950.76] P:1355.22 E:0.033589 |  Band is off with a free kick.
[7950.76 - 7953.32] P:1557.97 E:0.036846 |  A minute to go to half time and extra time.
[7953.32 - 7956.44] P:1544.25 E:0.040004 |  He literally beat me, see radio as, well, you should be.
[7956.44 - 7958.68] P:1417.36 E:0.031864 |  Here's Carvalho for Chelsea.
[7958.84 - 7960.36] P:1426.15 E:0.039900 |  A good pass to Kalu.
[7960.36 - 7962.68] P:1437.95 E:0.038599 |  Kalu turns and gets away from Brown again.
[7963.32 - 7964.12] P:1300.44 E:0.036647 |  Back to Lampard.
[7964.68 - 7965.56] P:1330.06 E:0.029173 |  Carvalho.
[7965.56 - 7966.20] P:1504.13 E:0.046680 |  McAleely.
[7966.84 - 7968.28] P:1494.20 E:0.041932 |  Well done, McAleely.
[7968.28 - 7970.28] P:1811.82 E:0.033239 |  Just skips between two United players.
[7970.28 - 7971.16] P:1408.79 E:0.039308 |  Finds Lampard.
[7971.16 - 7972.84] P:1582.94 E:0.032110 |  Lampard to McAleely again.
[7972.84 - 7975.80] P:1593.99 E:0.030134 |  Back to Ashley Cole, the very patient, Chelsea.
[7975.80 - 7979.40] P:1586.83 E:0.035014 |  Not much time left though in the first 15 minutes of extra time.
[7980.12 - 7982.04] P:1592.63 E:0.035755 |  Dink pass in for Ashley Cole.
[7982.04 - 7983.48] P:1626.95 E:0.036858 |  The ballack out.
[7983.48 - 7987.00] P:1643.77 E:0.039633 |  And referee decides that Hargreaves is pulling ballack back.
[7987.00 - 7988.28] P:1705.84 E:0.031108 |  It's a free kick, Chelsea.
[7988.28 - 7989.72] P:1249.60 E:0.040291 |  Yeah, I think he got that right as well.
[7990.52 - 7993.16] P:1486.69 E:0.044017 |  I think he, you know, he's been on the spot, hasn't he, all the time,
[7993.88 - 7994.76] P:1341.28 E:0.034506 |  Blue Bust, Bekel.
[7994.76 - 7997.16] P:1301.38 E:0.042512 |  And I don't think he's got too much wrong at all.
[7997.16 - 8001.00] P:1541.87 E:0.040237 |  Now, he's a candidate to referee the final of the European Championship.
[8001.56 - 8004.52] P:1530.99 E:0.036650 |  Mind you, that double header with this one probably unlikely.
[8004.52 - 8007.48] P:1735.54 E:0.037874 |  Here's Lampard with a free kick from the Chelsea left.
[8007.48 - 8008.76] P:1519.04 E:0.042034 |  Right foot in into the penalty.
[8008.76 - 8009.88] P:1576.90 E:0.042187 |  Skips off the head of Brown.
[8009.88 - 8010.60] P:1336.23 E:0.042646 |  That's a corner.
[8011.80 - 8014.36] P:1613.96 E:0.037058 |  Brown jumped, but it was a tired leap, wasn't it?
[8014.36 - 8018.20] P:1636.08 E:0.040573 |  And we've got two minutes of added time at the end of the first period of extra time.
[8018.68 - 8026.44] P:1747.56 E:0.032735 |  Lampard gets booed by the Manchester United fans as he goes across to take this corner
[8027.08 - 8027.72] P:1747.16 E:0.049122 |  from the right.
[8028.28 - 8030.20] P:1748.91 E:0.038636 |  Now, and Elk is there as well now.
[8030.20 - 8033.80] P:1717.59 E:0.036300 |  Terry played in high and it's Carvalho ahead the time.
[8033.80 - 8036.84] P:1648.47 E:0.037120 |  And if Collou had picked up possession, he should have done, he might have scored.
[8036.84 - 8041.80] P:1511.93 E:0.040442 |  Yeah, I think if Collou had been a little bit closer into the goal, instead of coming away from it,
[8041.80 - 8047.64] P:1587.04 E:0.034278 |  he'd had a much better chance to have got that to the ball as it came bouncing off the ground,
[8047.64 - 8050.44] P:1448.95 E:0.037505 |  bouncing off, he wasn't able to get his foot on the end of it.
[8050.44 - 8053.56] P:1626.14 E:0.035060 |  Well, I know it's three minutes to 10 in the UK.
[8053.56 - 8057.08] P:1537.36 E:0.039719 |  It's three minutes to one o'clock in the morning here in Russia.
[8058.44 - 8064.68] P:1432.52 E:0.036791 |  It is almost Istanbul all over again for Mike and me, but that would mean penalties.
[8066.28 - 8069.64] P:1677.97 E:0.038086 |  Now Manchester United with a throw in deep inside the Chelsea half,
[8069.64 - 8074.12] P:1620.19 E:0.035055 |  into the second minute of added time at the end of the first period of extra time.
[8074.84 - 8078.68] P:1552.38 E:0.042443 |  Level with the edge of the Chelsea penalty thrown by Brian to Hargreaves.
[8078.68 - 8080.68] P:1773.58 E:0.038100 |  They're very cautious now in Manchester United aren't they?
[8081.64 - 8082.92] P:1729.34 E:0.045264 |  No one wants to make an error.
[8083.48 - 8088.20] P:1874.52 E:0.033837 |  Ferdinand to Nani, tackle and fairly challenged and beaten by Ashley Cole.
[8088.20 - 8091.40] P:1633.52 E:0.040242 |  And has played upfield, there was a mistake there by Ferdinand, got away with it.
[8091.40 - 8094.52] P:1646.74 E:0.043376 |  Here's Collou on Collou wasted an opportunity.
[8094.52 - 8099.64] P:1665.32 E:0.039138 |  He had both Anelka and Drogo to his right, tried to run through in his own and didn't get through in his own.
[8100.20 - 8101.40] P:1764.95 E:0.041269 |  Hargreaves for United.
[8102.44 - 8103.80] P:1603.89 E:0.046980 |  Just over the halfway line.
[8104.20 - 8107.88] P:1619.54 E:0.038839 |  Tackled by Lampard, ball breaks out of play and it's a Chelsea throw in.
[8107.88 - 8110.68] P:1717.16 E:0.041313 |  Yeah, I don't know what Hargreaves is doing there.
[8110.68 - 8114.04] P:1470.02 E:0.036865 |  He seemed to dwell on the ball, not being able to find a pass at all.
[8114.04 - 8115.24] P:1290.53 E:0.050055 |  There are a lot of tired players.
[8117.96 - 8119.24] P:1745.99 E:0.031952 |  The pitch has not been great.
[8120.68 - 8123.32] P:1608.50 E:0.042525 |  People are watching in television, they might think it looks okay, but it ain't.
[8124.04 - 8130.20] P:1660.16 E:0.033951 |  And we've had our final seconds of stoppage time, of extra time.
[8130.20 - 8131.64] P:1419.42 E:0.041152 |  And what are your thoughts Graham?
[8131.64 - 8132.60] P:1489.44 E:0.043194 |  Still one one day.
[8132.60 - 8134.20] P:1633.80 E:0.034942 |  Does it become even more cautious?
[8134.20 - 8136.76] P:1761.30 E:0.039835 |  I think it's likely to do that as well.
[8136.76 - 8139.64] P:1559.71 E:0.038801 |  There's always the incidents we've just seen in that period.
[8139.64 - 8143.24] P:1655.81 E:0.041754 |  And it may be that a surprise shot actually gets the winner.
[8143.24 - 8144.36] P:1649.89 E:0.032765 |  We'll just have to wait to see.
[8144.36 - 8148.12] P:1564.24 E:0.039910 |  But generally, and the referee wanting them straight back on as well,
[8148.12 - 8152.68] P:1416.66 E:0.040657 |  generally the second half tend to peter out and it runs out to pedal to us.
[8152.68 - 8156.76] P:1522.04 E:0.039904 |  Well, Ballack's getting a rub down on his right thigh.
[8157.72 - 8162.04] P:1385.34 E:0.042597 |  And there's another Chelsea player lying in his back and might even be John Terry,
[8162.04 - 8162.84] P:1449.14 E:0.041180 |  I think the skipper.
[8163.56 - 8166.52] P:1599.78 E:0.040717 |  But Manchester United, as they get at the end of normal time,
[8166.52 - 8170.52] P:1591.44 E:0.032265 |  generally just standing up, which I think psychologically is a good move.
[8170.52 - 8172.20] P:1265.35 E:0.038418 |  Yeah, no doubt about that.
[8172.20 - 8175.32] P:1570.05 E:0.040670 |  There are a few Chelsea players down, sat down stretching themselves.
[8175.88 - 8179.32] P:1324.33 E:0.045417 |  At the present time, the Manchester United players are there,
[8179.32 - 8183.48] P:1583.77 E:0.038937 |  but they're all being pulled back by the referee to start the second half of extra time.
[8183.48 - 8186.92] P:1548.95 E:0.037655 |  And to describe the second period of extra time, mugging them.
[8187.24 - 8190.36] P:1376.95 E:0.031958 |  Well, I jokingly said this morning, Graham,
[8190.36 - 8192.68] P:1686.33 E:0.037513 |  why don't they just cut straight to the penalty shootout?
[8192.68 - 8197.32] P:1690.14 E:0.039798 |  Because there was always the possibility, I think, that it might come down to this.
[8197.32 - 8200.04] P:1592.62 E:0.031297 |  A whole season of Champions League football.
[8200.04 - 8206.68] P:1678.20 E:0.038491 |  We've got another 15 minutes energy sapping minutes here in the early hours of the morning in Moscow.
[8207.24 - 8211.64] P:1532.91 E:0.038674 |  And if we don't get a breakthrough, then once more it'll go to spot kicks.
[8211.64 - 8214.84] P:1429.46 E:0.035212 |  And Manchester United to restart,
[8215.08 - 8219.00] P:1601.62 E:0.041678 |  Manchester United to restart playing from right to left.
[8219.64 - 8220.52] P:1481.65 E:0.038684 |  And it's Evera.
[8221.24 - 8224.28] P:1483.20 E:0.032996 |  Evera to Carrick on the halfway line.
[8224.28 - 8225.56] P:1628.25 E:0.043582 |  Carrick forward to Tevez.
[8226.28 - 8227.80] P:1409.76 E:0.044019 |  And of course, now they have to be very...
[8228.84 - 8231.32] P:1438.19 E:0.039908 |  They have to think about if they are to make changes,
[8231.32 - 8233.08] P:1637.71 E:0.042116 |  they have to keep their penalty takers out there.
[8233.64 - 8237.40] P:1665.29 E:0.041711 |  Wonder whether we might see Shevchenko coming on if it goes to a penalty shootout.
[8238.28 - 8241.80] P:1637.82 E:0.038867 |  Mixed results, of course, from him in Champions League finals from the spot.
[8241.80 - 8243.72] P:1778.19 E:0.036499 |  Giggs blocked, though, by Essie.
[8243.72 - 8247.80] P:1639.73 E:0.034083 |  And Essie stood up well considering what happened in the first half.
[8247.80 - 8249.88] P:1688.34 E:0.044550 |  And now Anelka, who's hardly been in the game,
[8249.88 - 8252.04] P:1737.31 E:0.039642 |  Anelka now comes forward for Chelsea.
[8252.04 - 8253.64] P:1647.08 E:0.037772 |  And it's a good run from Anelka.
[8253.64 - 8255.56] P:1776.28 E:0.034098 |  He looked for Drogba, but Ferdinand clears.
[8256.12 - 8258.12] P:1485.17 E:0.037957 |  And McAleely and now Lampard.
[8258.12 - 8260.12] P:1561.69 E:0.037138 |  And that ball is sent wide to the far side.
[8260.12 - 8262.12] P:1739.50 E:0.036127 |  And Ashley Cole is galloping onto it.
[8262.12 - 8263.48] P:1612.13 E:0.047426 |  Drogba and Kalu in the area.
[8264.20 - 8266.44] P:1687.46 E:0.039981 |  Ashley Cole cuts the ball back to Lampard.
[8266.44 - 8268.84] P:1771.14 E:0.041345 |  Chelsea, remember, have hit the post twice tonight.
[8268.84 - 8273.48] P:1658.46 E:0.035210 |  And here comes Michael Balak, and that's defended well by Ferdinand of Manchester United.
[8273.48 - 8277.16] P:1543.02 E:0.036001 |  And the whistle's gone over on that far side by the referee.
[8277.16 - 8279.72] P:1732.03 E:0.039217 |  Referee, by the way, like the pitches from Slovakia.
[8280.28 - 8282.28] P:1627.52 E:0.038702 |  And it's a free kick to Manchester United.
[8282.28 - 8286.52] P:1452.94 E:0.044630 |  Yeah, I think, probably, it was Ashley Cole going in with his foot high there,
[8286.52 - 8289.00] P:1464.57 E:0.042653 |  and he's given the free kick to United.
[8290.20 - 8292.68] P:1205.86 E:0.045176 |  But I think he's had a very good game, the referee.
[8292.68 - 8294.36] P:1127.26 E:0.044684 |  It's handled it very well.
[8295.40 - 8296.60] P:1510.37 E:0.043478 |  Quick word from Stan.
[8296.60 - 8298.28] P:1389.01 E:0.046585 |  Yeah, just looking at the pitch, actually.
[8298.28 - 8300.44] P:1402.49 E:0.039351 |  The pitch starts to look quite dark in patches, isn't it?
[8300.44 - 8302.28] P:1313.20 E:0.043014 |  Players not able to keep their foot in.
[8303.08 - 8307.40] P:1289.77 E:0.040470 |  I think that's a very, very brave man to pick the winner out of these two.
[8309.16 - 8313.64] P:1635.43 E:0.038729 |  Well, neither of these sides have particularly good records penalty shootouts.
[8313.64 - 8317.56] P:1438.40 E:0.034187 |  But anyway, let's keep talking it up and maybe it won't happen.
[8317.56 - 8319.32] P:1720.62 E:0.035389 |  It's Viddicke of Manchester United.
[8319.32 - 8322.76] P:1556.20 E:0.034548 |  It's 1-1, extra time being played here.
[8322.76 - 8326.60] P:1652.24 E:0.037840 |  You're listening to BBC Radio, and it's Viddicke of Manchester United.
[8326.60 - 8330.68] P:1511.82 E:0.038963 |  Well, a rather tired ball, but he finds Nani over on the far side of the field.
[8330.68 - 8333.08] P:1653.44 E:0.035411 |  Nani's one of the two United substitutes.
[8333.80 - 8339.56] P:1606.76 E:0.035966 |  Nani, bringing the ball in field, and now Carrick trying to pick a pass here for Manchester United.
[8339.56 - 8340.52] P:1715.01 E:0.046532 |  It's with Ronaldo.
[8340.52 - 8343.80] P:1739.46 E:0.034424 |  Again, the pace is very slow, though, from Manchester United.
[8344.36 - 8348.84] P:1670.34 E:0.039150 |  Hargreaves and Carrick again, but they're all back apart from Druckweber of Chelsea.
[8348.84 - 8351.56] P:1789.56 E:0.035687 |  Giggs, but he can't get the ball past Essian.
[8351.56 - 8353.96] P:1654.32 E:0.039598 |  And McElhagley now gathers it in once more.
[8354.52 - 8358.36] P:1803.17 E:0.041416 |  McElhagley almost caught in possession there, and he was caught as well.
[8358.92 - 8361.80] P:1749.20 E:0.032631 |  Accidentally, I think this time by Patrice Everett.
[8362.60 - 8366.76] P:1646.75 E:0.033158 |  They know each other, of course, from the international side, and it's Chelsea's ball.
[8367.32 - 8368.52] P:1634.04 E:0.053450 |  Yeah, just caught in there.
[8368.52 - 8371.72] P:1546.75 E:0.036781 |  I think that was an accident, and in that respect, and they get on.
[8371.72 - 8374.28] P:1707.67 E:0.039509 |  But it's all slow. Nobody's rushing to take the free kick.
[8374.28 - 8378.12] P:1695.33 E:0.040589 |  I think we'll see this unless a chance suddenly presents itself.
[8378.12 - 8380.44] P:1609.08 E:0.044033 |  I think the game will gradually slow down.
[8381.40 - 8384.44] P:1643.96 E:0.039716 |  And it's Avram Grant at the moment in the technical area.
[8384.44 - 8387.32] P:1655.34 E:0.040193 |  There's Chelsea not the ball forward towards Drogba.
[8387.32 - 8391.40] P:1696.18 E:0.033662 |  Drogba's great power there, but in fact, it's too much power for the referee.
[8391.40 - 8394.52] P:1598.10 E:0.033216 |  Manchester United have the free kick.
[8395.32 - 8399.96] P:1511.35 E:0.037072 |  Fans, Manchester United to our left, Chelsea to our right.
[8400.68 - 8403.00] P:1467.02 E:0.039655 |  Which end, I wonder, would they take the penalties?
[8403.00 - 8408.84] P:1638.72 E:0.033754 |  Clearance by Manchester United, and that's out of play, and it's quite flat at the moment.
[8409.32 - 8416.20] P:1511.19 E:0.038133 |  And the usual routine in these extra times is sometimes they try it on a little bit in the first period,
[8416.20 - 8421.64] P:1551.83 E:0.033455 |  and then as it gets closer and closer towards the end, they just about shut up shot really.
[8422.44 - 8424.28] P:1386.91 E:0.030506 |  And now Vitticte of Manchester United.
[8425.16 - 8426.44] P:1348.33 E:0.018447 |  Vitticte to third now.
[8426.44 - 8429.08] P:1584.15 E:0.039846 |  1-1. The goals came in the first half.
[8429.08 - 8433.64] P:1726.39 E:0.037857 |  Manchester United on top, in the first half, Chelsea on top in the second.
[8433.64 - 8435.32] P:1567.40 E:0.028715 |  United give the ball away.
[8435.80 - 8441.80] P:1653.36 E:0.033305 |  John Terry's clearance, and free kick is given to Manchester United for the offside.
[8441.80 - 8447.48] P:1659.06 E:0.039435 |  Great clearance by John Terry to deny Manchester United in the first period of extra time.
[8447.48 - 8449.48] P:1646.51 E:0.039827 |  Again, almost at walking pace now.
[8449.48 - 8453.96] P:1700.80 E:0.034268 |  Vitticte finds Carrick, who will shuffle forward and pick out Teves.
[8453.96 - 8455.16] P:1873.31 E:0.034462 |  Dicks in the centre.
[8456.12 - 8461.32] P:1492.73 E:0.036331 |  It hasn't gone off the Chelsea defender, though the United supporters were certainly howling for a corner to goal kick.
[8462.28 - 8466.04] P:1631.21 E:0.040971 |  Yeah, he tried to burst through between two Chelsea defenders.
[8466.04 - 8467.16] P:1440.40 E:0.031868 |  Ball hit him really.
[8467.16 - 8469.00] P:1628.90 E:0.040501 |  Probably came off his knee actually.
[8469.00 - 8471.08] P:1550.02 E:0.042618 |  Goes out for a goal kick.
[8471.72 - 8475.32] P:1589.70 E:0.041009 |  Both teams to a degree understandably looking tired now.
[8475.32 - 8481.64] P:1377.78 E:0.042247 |  There's no really umph about the game at all, so people are just waiting, I think, for this game to run out.
[8483.00 - 8490.76] P:1399.13 E:0.039936 |  Well, in the stadium of course, where Sebastian Koh and Steve Ovec did their stuff in the Olympics here.
[8490.84 - 8495.64] P:1613.84 E:0.038312 |  These two now grinding it out towards the end of this Champions League season.
[8495.64 - 8501.32] P:1456.88 E:0.039167 |  We've played already 20 minutes nearly of the extra time here.
[8501.32 - 8503.08] P:1700.38 E:0.043103 |  The ball is thrown in towards Kalu.
[8503.08 - 8508.52] P:1624.38 E:0.036996 |  Kalu can't control it, and again the whistle's gone, and the game is stopping quite a lot here.
[8508.52 - 8509.96] P:1688.30 E:0.032919 |  It's a Manchester United kick.
[8510.52 - 8513.88] P:1603.25 E:0.039714 |  Yeah, it's almost as if, you know, it's prepared to go to penalties.
[8513.88 - 8515.72] P:1495.54 E:0.043445 |  Now there's going to be a winner, there has to be.
[8516.12 - 8521.08] P:1409.18 E:0.038832 |  That somehow, you know, it could be always very, very disappointing because
[8522.12 - 8528.20] P:1489.56 E:0.037560 |  one person, the goalkeeper can't lose, and one person probably misses that penalty,
[8528.20 - 8530.52] P:1365.43 E:0.042236 |  and he has to live with that for the rest of his life.
[8530.52 - 8533.88] P:1624.74 E:0.035414 |  So, you know, it's the big, big moments.
[8533.88 - 8537.80] P:1743.58 E:0.034589 |  And the two sides can make one more change each if they care to.
[8538.60 - 8541.16] P:1612.11 E:0.041472 |  In goes Kalu to win the ball for Chelsea.
[8541.16 - 8543.00] P:1637.07 E:0.043581 |  And the ball may break here for Anelka.
[8543.08 - 8547.48] P:1710.79 E:0.041611 |  And Anelka going forward, and can it challenge for Manchester United from Viddic,
[8547.48 - 8548.76] P:1749.08 E:0.043945 |  which the referee didn't like.
[8549.48 - 8550.92] P:1792.82 E:0.040942 |  And Viddic goes down with Kramp.
[8552.20 - 8556.04] P:1749.11 E:0.038451 |  But Chelsea have a free kick, and this is not a bad position for them, Graham.
[8556.04 - 8559.00] P:1524.97 E:0.036752 |  It's interesting, Droglicum's across to him, you know, and it's,
[8559.00 - 8561.56] P:1692.32 E:0.039635 |  he sees Viddic has probably got Kramp as well.
[8562.36 - 8564.76] P:1391.56 E:0.041161 |  And he's almost said to him, get up.
[8566.60 - 8567.64] P:1690.76 E:0.049150 |  And when he gets to his feet.
[8567.64 - 8569.08] P:1638.07 E:0.038998 |  Probably even asking him to be guard.
[8569.08 - 8571.16] P:1642.69 E:0.045020 |  He gets the yellow card from the referee.
[8571.16 - 8572.28] P:1446.79 E:0.017310 |  Yeah.
[8572.28 - 8572.76] P:1640.33 E:0.042320 |  Now then.
[8574.20 - 8575.96] P:1749.44 E:0.049471 |  Drogba, this is maybe his scene.
[8577.00 - 8578.68] P:1711.51 E:0.048587 |  Balak's not very far away either.
[8579.24 - 8582.28] P:1623.89 E:0.040144 |  It's about 25 yards away from Vandezar's goal.
[8582.28 - 8584.68] P:1512.76 E:0.044790 |  He's trying to sort the wall out.
[8585.88 - 8590.52] P:1607.69 E:0.043077 |  We are 21 minutes now into extra time here,
[8590.52 - 8592.84] P:1680.89 E:0.039183 |  and it's going to be Didier Drogba, I think.
[8592.84 - 8595.80] P:1526.43 E:0.043739 |  In what, you know, many people are saying could be his farewell appearance,
[8595.80 - 8598.76] P:1737.58 E:0.036942 |  although Michael Balak is still there just to confuse the issue.
[8599.40 - 8601.08] P:1684.45 E:0.047376 |  Cavalio's gone into the area.
[8601.08 - 8603.96] P:1779.42 E:0.038551 |  John Terry's, will he have a blast here,
[8603.96 - 8605.88] P:1722.47 E:0.037458 |  or will he try and put it onto somebody's head?
[8606.76 - 8608.44] P:1814.89 E:0.047184 |  Free kick, and it's Drogba!
[8608.44 - 8612.12] P:1493.37 E:0.033492 |  Just wide, just wide, but Vandezar follows it into the advertising.
[8612.12 - 8614.20] P:1193.78 E:0.048088 |  Yeah, I think Vandezar knew that was going wide.
[8614.20 - 8616.20] P:1612.10 E:0.033434 |  I mean, he got some pace on the shot.
[8616.20 - 8622.20] P:1448.83 E:0.038431 |  It was below crossbar height anyhow, but wide, so Vandezar was quite content to see that go wide.
[8622.84 - 8626.68] P:1615.46 E:0.048336 |  We appear to be heading towards the inevitable here in Moscow.
[8626.68 - 8627.72] P:1668.66 E:0.039252 |  Graham looks at his watch.
[8628.52 - 8632.68] P:1694.84 E:0.043935 |  And it shows that it's about six minutes past one here in the morning.
[8633.88 - 8637.56] P:1661.53 E:0.038292 |  The game kicked off on the 21st, and it's ending on the 22nd,
[8638.20 - 8640.12] P:1663.01 E:0.041841 |  and Manchester United have the ball.
[8641.72 - 8645.24] P:1659.11 E:0.046147 |  As Alan was saying earlier, in the first half it didn't look as if we were,
[8645.24 - 8648.36] P:1802.14 E:0.042225 |  there would be any possibility really, the way United were in charge,
[8648.36 - 8649.48] P:1791.96 E:0.035492 |  of it going this distance.
[8649.48 - 8653.48] P:1650.10 E:0.030880 |  As Cavalio now clears, everybody having to concentrate.
[8653.48 - 8655.96] P:1808.58 E:0.037297 |  Loose header from Viddic, Balak's ball forward.
[8655.96 - 8659.96] P:1805.94 E:0.037925 |  It's ricocheted off Hargreaves, and that's a very good pass from John Terry
[8659.96 - 8662.60] P:1771.20 E:0.037479 |  to send Ashley Cole away down the left-hand side.
[8663.24 - 8664.68] P:1740.19 E:0.038881 |  Cole infield to Drogba.
[8664.68 - 8669.24] P:1790.64 E:0.036850 |  Drogba trying to hold off Ferdinand, but he only presents the ball to Ronaldo.
[8669.24 - 8671.24] P:1647.65 E:0.044714 |  Only Tevez ahead though for Ronaldo.
[8671.24 - 8676.68] P:1770.36 E:0.041084 |  Ronaldo goes past one, two players, and get ups as the referee as he goes down onto Balak's challenge.
[8677.32 - 8680.28] P:1835.90 E:0.039556 |  Referee doesn't give Ronaldo the free kick.
[8680.28 - 8682.28] P:1895.32 E:0.038456 |  Ronaldo now might have a touch of cramp.
[8682.36 - 8685.32] P:1796.93 E:0.040455 |  Tevez has got the ball, I bet he gets back on his feet quickly now though,
[8685.32 - 8688.04] P:1693.59 E:0.036969 |  and Tevez is doing really well inside the centre circle.
[8688.04 - 8692.44] P:1749.34 E:0.038343 |  Tevez finding Nani down the right, and of course Ronaldo's back on his feet again.
[8692.44 - 8697.00] P:1732.78 E:0.043772 |  Nani into the area, Giggs and Nani both, the ball clear to Ronaldo.
[8697.00 - 8700.44] P:1771.02 E:0.035734 |  Ronaldo shot straight at Michael Balak, Michael Carrick.
[8700.44 - 8703.00] P:1688.30 E:0.037703 |  There may be possibilities now for Manchester United.
[8703.00 - 8706.20] P:1679.83 E:0.034912 |  Hargreaves to Evra, lots of red shirts available.
[8706.20 - 8710.68] P:1737.20 E:0.036229 |  Evra's ball in isn't good enough, headed away by Balak, retrieved by Hargreaves.
[8710.68 - 8715.16] P:1781.58 E:0.039303 |  Hargreaves going to the right-hand side to find Wes Brown, and going back to the return.
[8715.16 - 8717.80] P:1818.46 E:0.033640 |  Hargreaves ball in and it's an easy catch for Czech.
[8718.76 - 8727.08] P:1763.18 E:0.036983 |  Just a couple of minutes of some very attacking play by Manchester United, increased the tempo and the pace of it.
[8727.08 - 8730.76] P:1622.78 E:0.034588 |  Difficult for them to do that of course on a regular basis now,
[8730.76 - 8733.56] P:1623.79 E:0.040539 |  and in fact Petr Czech has kicked the ball out of play.
[8734.20 - 8739.40] P:1774.27 E:0.037538 |  Rain falling relentlessly here on an unpleasant evening really in Moscow.
[8739.40 - 8741.72] P:1813.56 E:0.040777 |  More injuries, more cramp and more stancholomy.
[8742.68 - 8747.80] P:1763.77 E:0.040088 |  Obviously now, fluid is it really important, that's where the cramp is coming from.
[8747.80 - 8752.92] P:1804.40 E:0.035593 |  Simple dehydration, and several players, Chelsea players in particular,
[8752.92 - 8759.08] P:1824.14 E:0.038741 |  Ashley Cole, John Terry, Ricardo Carvalho, all taking the time to get stretched those hamstrings,
[8759.08 - 8760.20] P:1951.86 E:0.045041 |  stretch those calves.
[8760.20 - 8765.48] P:1880.76 E:0.037606 |  They've disappointed from both sides to be honest, in the final third, when it's come to whipping balls in.
[8766.28 - 8772.12] P:1567.23 E:0.040467 |  Either hard and low across the ground, or whipping it in the danger area between the penalty spot and the 6-yard box.
[8772.12 - 8773.32] P:1548.04 E:0.040454 |  The delivery has been poor.
[8774.52 - 8781.56] P:1685.90 E:0.042376 |  And after all the early attectiveness of the game by the way, Lampard and Hargreaves there were helping each other out to try and get rid of the cramp.
[8781.56 - 8787.56] P:1644.53 E:0.040012 |  But having said all that, there's a scene developing then over on the far side of the field, with Tevez and Drogba.
[8788.20 - 8789.80] P:1686.21 E:0.040718 |  Narnie I think is trying to keep the pace.
[8790.36 - 8796.44] P:1562.36 E:0.042434 |  Cavalio and McAlea stepping in, and it's just getting a little out of hand here.
[8796.44 - 8800.28] P:1613.01 E:0.043951 |  Oh, Vittic and Drogba. The referee just needs to get everyone away.
[8801.00 - 8804.52] P:1826.94 E:0.039110 |  Now, I don't know what Vittic's problem is, he's shaking his fist at Drogba,
[8805.32 - 8809.56] P:1656.42 E:0.038759 |  and the officials are going in there to help out, the little alliance has dropped his flag,
[8810.28 - 8814.04] P:1591.94 E:0.037940 |  and we're going to have even more time to be played in this game.
[8814.84 - 8816.20] P:1580.59 E:0.043224 |  What's all that about, Graham?
[8816.68 - 8820.52] P:1637.45 E:0.040853 |  I wish I could answer it because it seemed to come out of nothing at all there.
[8820.52 - 8825.88] P:1538.10 E:0.037032 |  Certainly some people, whether Drogba's at it, Vittic, I'm not too certain.
[8825.88 - 8831.40] P:1454.58 E:0.042178 |  I don't think the referee is aware of it. He's got his notebook, he's coming to Balak, he shows the yellow card to Balak.
[8833.40 - 8836.60] P:1617.91 E:0.042503 |  He's having a word with his assistants, with Tevez as well.
[8836.60 - 8838.84] P:1606.79 E:0.044511 |  Oh, a red card to Drogba.
[8839.00 - 8840.04] P:1686.22 E:0.045273 |  But did he aid Drogba?
[8843.56 - 8844.60] P:1805.96 E:0.051027 |  Did he aid Drogba?
[8845.80 - 8850.12] P:1568.83 E:0.036978 |  It's going to be sent off here in the Champions League final,
[8851.64 - 8854.12] P:1834.20 E:0.049847 |  and the yellow card being shown to Carlos Tevez.
[8855.88 - 8860.52] P:1694.32 E:0.039987 |  Well, this is Drogba's last game for Chelsea, this is how he's going to finish,
[8860.52 - 8865.16] P:1635.57 E:0.038881 |  and he can't take a penalty while it was a flap around Vittic's face,
[8865.80 - 8868.68] P:1563.67 E:0.032838 |  and then a push as well on Vittic.
[8868.68 - 8871.08] P:1631.28 E:0.033191 |  Did that merit the red card, Graham?
[8871.08 - 8875.88] P:1561.09 E:0.040137 |  Well, it's hand to face, you can look at it, it might have been more than one to, you can say what we want,
[8875.88 - 8880.52] P:1760.64 E:0.039243 |  we've only just touched him, he's actually slapped him or touched him around the face,
[8880.52 - 8884.52] P:1573.61 E:0.038314 |  and people say, well, you know, he shouldn't do that or, well, he hasn't hurt him.
[8884.52 - 8888.68] P:1568.00 E:0.034729 |  Hey, you don't put your hand up around people's faces, it's as simple as that, I'm afraid.
[8888.68 - 8891.48] P:1630.35 E:0.045798 |  Put it in, Andy's stepping in between Drogba and Vittic,
[8892.20 - 8896.36] P:1801.82 E:0.043188 |  just to make sure there's no more here, Drogba still hasn't left the field here,
[8896.36 - 8897.64] P:1783.25 E:0.038304 |  Stan, what was your view of that?
[8897.64 - 8900.20] P:1870.63 E:0.042109 |  Yeah, it was twice, it was right in front of the referee as well,
[8900.20 - 8903.40] P:1735.63 E:0.040191 |  first of the left hand on Vittic, and then second with a right,
[8903.40 - 8906.36] P:1730.46 E:0.042655 |  just as the referee was coming up within a yard or so.
[8906.36 - 8909.40] P:1778.98 E:0.036799 |  Crazy for him, did he, Drogba, what we've seen out in the room,
[8909.40 - 8912.44] P:1687.56 E:0.039159 |  in 67 minutes or less than that now,
[8912.44 - 8914.92] P:1443.13 E:0.028110 |  and Chelsea are going to have to reshuffle,
[8914.92 - 8919.00] P:1692.51 E:0.036721 |  saw Steve Clark just on the monitor there, turned into going to a four,
[8919.72 - 8923.72] P:1696.75 E:0.032825 |  and, well, could that be the last of the Chelsea, Scherper, did the A-Drogba.
[8923.72 - 8928.76] P:1858.89 E:0.039300 |  And now we have absolutely no idea really how much time we've got left in this game,
[8928.76 - 8932.60] P:1801.28 E:0.036342 |  but surely now the Pendelham turns towards Manchester United again, Graeme.
[8932.60 - 8934.68] P:1718.29 E:0.036732 |  Well, you would think so, wouldn't you, just in there,
[8934.68 - 8939.16] P:1664.75 E:0.043992 |  and yet we've seen so often teams go back, they'll go to a 4-4-1 or something like that,
[8939.16 - 8942.92] P:1596.58 E:0.034040 |  make some difficult to break down, so it doesn't always follow
[8942.92 - 8945.72] P:1656.95 E:0.034832 |  that the team with the 11 people will come on.
[8946.44 - 8949.48] P:1550.19 E:0.039969 |  Ronaldo's been fouled by Esi, and it's been there the whole evening, though,
[8949.48 - 8951.48] P:1667.83 E:0.041474 |  on the surface, bubbling away, hasn't it?
[8951.48 - 8953.48] P:1740.18 E:0.041983 |  Yes, definitely, all the time, all the time.
[8953.48 - 8958.44] P:1528.97 E:0.037118 |  And a yellow card to Esi, and so much for, you know, respect the officials again here tonight.
[8958.44 - 8962.04] P:1729.47 E:0.031588 |  It hasn't kind of looked good, really, around Europe,
[8962.04 - 8965.40] P:1638.19 E:0.039062 |  as Everett, nutmegs the defender, Cavalio steps in,
[8965.40 - 8968.28] P:1733.88 E:0.037111 |  Everett seem to follow through unnecessarily on Cavalio,
[8968.28 - 8971.16] P:1687.23 E:0.036265 |  and it's pretty scruffy and scrappy at the moment.
[8971.40 - 8974.92] P:1598.84 E:0.030418 |  Eight yellow cards and one red, says Alan Green,
[8974.92 - 8976.92] P:1685.84 E:0.037131 |  and so that's the end of Didier Drogba,
[8976.92 - 8980.60] P:1552.37 E:0.039673 |  and I would have thought he was one of the potential penalty-sakers.
[8980.60 - 8982.60] P:1704.72 E:0.038757 |  Definitely, no doubt about that.
[8984.60 - 8989.32] P:1461.09 E:0.040441 |  We hear the United fans over the Chelsea fans just at the moment,
[8989.32 - 8993.40] P:1714.62 E:0.034691 |  and we get a television picture of Romain Kramovich as well here.
[8993.40 - 8996.60] P:1669.43 E:0.031733 |  Wonder, a ruble for his thoughts at the moment,
[8996.60 - 8999.40] P:1566.92 E:0.031081 |  as the Reds have been playing for a while,
[9000.12 - 9003.00] P:1624.40 E:0.038168 |  as forward comes Owen Hargreaves,
[9003.00 - 9005.40] P:1967.15 E:0.040568 |  can Manchester United now seize the initiative,
[9005.40 - 9008.52] P:1813.20 E:0.040538 |  but on the counterattack, it's Calou, there's no Drogba, of course, now.
[9008.52 - 9010.12] P:1864.77 E:0.028929 |  There's no target man to hit.
[9010.12 - 9014.12] P:1733.37 E:0.035617 |  Calou's going forward, and running towards the corner flag,
[9014.12 - 9015.24] P:1814.07 E:0.038464 |  across comes Wes Brown.
[9015.88 - 9018.52] P:1751.47 E:0.042852 |  We'll have to really look to the fourth official here,
[9019.40 - 9022.68] P:1833.94 E:0.043721 |  for guidance on how much time there will be at the end of this,
[9022.68 - 9027.24] P:1795.93 E:0.032651 |  because I make it, we've only got two minutes of the extra time to go,
[9027.24 - 9030.68] P:1678.92 E:0.037529 |  but the game stopped there for a good two minutes during all that.
[9031.24 - 9035.16] P:1527.98 E:0.039608 |  At the moment, we've got Hank, Tane, Catter, and C-Clarke, and Avram Grant,
[9035.16 - 9038.68] P:1581.65 E:0.039043 |  all in the technical area, as the ball is with Edwin van der Sar,
[9038.68 - 9042.84] P:1798.70 E:0.038778 |  who may well be facing another penalty shootout soon in a Champions League final.
[9042.84 - 9045.88] P:1611.14 E:0.035461 |  Ronaldo on to Everett, and that's good defending,
[9045.88 - 9047.96] P:1746.85 E:0.033113 |  strong defending by Michael Essian.
[9048.52 - 9050.36] P:1723.02 E:0.044391 |  Chelsea appeal for the throw-in, and they get it.
[9051.24 - 9053.00] P:1682.28 E:0.041592 |  You know, I know that at the start of the game,
[9053.00 - 9055.96] P:1407.72 E:0.041422 |  Essian would look at himself for the goal that Ronaldo scored,
[9055.96 - 9060.12] P:1471.07 E:0.034786 |  and having Ronaldo run at him, but I think Essian has stuck at his task very, very well,
[9060.12 - 9063.56] P:1433.80 E:0.039989 |  and gone forward. I think he had a very, very good game, Essian.
[9064.28 - 9067.40] P:1734.05 E:0.043390 |  Fourth official just pushing Avram Grant and C-Clarke back,
[9067.40 - 9070.04] P:1685.75 E:0.038004 |  as they show that their frustration down there,
[9070.04 - 9074.12] P:1624.13 E:0.038111 |  and Elka can't hold onto it, hasn't really made a great impact since he came on,
[9074.68 - 9076.60] P:1709.29 E:0.039233 |  and it's going to be Manchester United's throw-in.
[9076.60 - 9079.72] P:1709.49 E:0.032697 |  They have an extra man advantage now, can they make it count?
[9079.72 - 9081.80] P:1605.23 E:0.040762 |  Carrick allows the ball to come on to him,
[9081.80 - 9085.64] P:1700.70 E:0.037629 |  and then finds Tevez, and Tevez forward to Ryan Giggs, who's given offside.
[9086.20 - 9087.32] P:1758.96 E:0.033727 |  Great kick to Chelsea.
[9087.32 - 9092.28] P:1602.42 E:0.039643 |  Yeah, straight in line with it, have to agree with the lines when they're caught offside,
[9092.28 - 9093.72] P:1492.67 E:0.042079 |  but a nice little movement.
[9094.28 - 9096.52] P:1669.41 E:0.038413 |  This is what Manchester United, you know, in the first half,
[9096.52 - 9099.56] P:1595.09 E:0.039288 |  they were doing so well, lost their way in the second half,
[9099.56 - 9104.12] P:1655.13 E:0.040156 |  in their sharp passing movement, weren't able to continue with them in the second half,
[9104.12 - 9105.80] P:1689.97 E:0.032893 |  as Chelsea took control.
[9105.80 - 9111.32] P:1744.38 E:0.039918 |  The weather's awful here now, it really is raining heavily here in the Olympic Stadium in Moscow.
[9112.04 - 9115.08] P:1764.55 E:0.039310 |  Two minutes about it's time we are now facing here
[9115.96 - 9118.52] P:1579.12 E:0.042852 |  and we now enter those two minutes.
[9118.52 - 9122.12] P:1680.14 E:0.037665 |  We are two minutes away from yet another penalty shootout.
[9122.12 - 9125.00] P:1618.81 E:0.034582 |  How important they've become in the modern day.
[9125.64 - 9128.92] P:1638.33 E:0.037033 |  They now do tend to settle so many many big games.
[9128.92 - 9131.48] P:1775.16 E:0.044283 |  This one was always so close to call.
[9132.12 - 9137.48] P:1616.74 E:0.034731 |  It was so hard really to pick a favourite here between these two,
[9138.12 - 9142.20] P:1796.43 E:0.040884 |  and it looks like it is going to go to the lottery of a penalty shootout.
[9143.16 - 9147.56] P:1623.10 E:0.035963 |  Now an Elkas header on, away by Ferdinand of Manchester United.
[9148.20 - 9153.08] P:1597.10 E:0.037624 |  Chelsea now really won't be so ambitious I don't think, without Drogba,
[9153.08 - 9154.84] P:1614.44 E:0.037738 |  united with Narni.
[9154.84 - 9156.92] P:1711.01 E:0.036058 |  They may get one more chance.
[9156.92 - 9159.32] P:1660.79 E:0.037980 |  Narni onto Tevez, Tevez working very hard.
[9159.32 - 9163.08] P:1797.17 E:0.036264 |  He's got gigs available down the centre, gigs with a lovely first touch,
[9163.08 - 9165.72] P:1847.97 E:0.040540 |  still gigs on the area, on the edge of the area,
[9165.72 - 9167.32] P:1799.51 E:0.037204 |  gigs balling with his left foot.
[9167.32 - 9169.72] P:1732.31 E:0.035460 |  Narni tried again and it was great defending by Ashley Cole.
[9170.44 - 9173.64] P:1727.79 E:0.033169 |  And now more players going down in the penalty area.
[9173.64 - 9175.80] P:1610.31 E:0.043046 |  So although we've only got one minute of added time,
[9175.80 - 9180.76] P:1561.29 E:0.036215 |  the game will stop once more and the referee will allow the injured players to be treated.
[9180.76 - 9183.40] P:1442.44 E:0.043480 |  Yeah, he's got crashed by Cole.
[9183.40 - 9188.04] P:1434.08 E:0.038681 |  He's got, as Narni comes in, they collide with the heads,
[9188.04 - 9191.00] P:1402.44 E:0.036098 |  but Narni coming in more powerfully from behind Cole.
[9191.00 - 9194.84] P:1539.41 E:0.043624 |  So both players injured, both players laying down, being treated.
[9195.72 - 9198.04] P:1470.93 E:0.051058 |  And neither of them really moving at all at the moment.
[9199.72 - 9203.80] P:1714.87 E:0.042476 |  And would you imagine, Stan, that over the last 10 days,
[9203.80 - 9206.60] P:1653.13 E:0.039005 |  maybe particularly these two have been practicing penalties?
[9206.60 - 9208.28] P:1615.79 E:0.037492 |  Absolutely, without a doubt.
[9208.28 - 9212.84] P:1528.74 E:0.039518 |  I think that for both sides, they've realised how important it is.
[9212.84 - 9216.04] P:1678.35 E:0.037914 |  You alluded to it, Mike, in European football these days.
[9216.04 - 9218.44] P:1548.54 E:0.044197 |  We all thought that it would be a very, very close game,
[9218.44 - 9220.84] P:1476.58 E:0.037142 |  maybe 1-0, 2-1 either way.
[9220.84 - 9224.04] P:1477.53 E:0.037188 |  And certainly no surprises that it's going to go to penalties.
[9224.04 - 9227.32] P:1459.43 E:0.035500 |  So whoever the five are, of course, did the A-Drogba,
[9227.32 - 9230.60] P:1209.35 E:0.042789 |  maybe 1-1 for Chelsea, maybe even Wayne Rooney as well,
[9230.60 - 9231.56] P:1621.49 E:0.026213 |  from Manchester United.
[9231.56 - 9233.48] P:1282.92 E:0.030884 |  They're certainly not going to be taking them.
[9233.48 - 9236.36] P:1371.07 E:0.044503 |  It'd be interesting to see who lines up in each five.
[9237.80 - 9239.48] P:1646.58 E:0.046792 |  Absolutely certain, of course.
[9239.48 - 9242.60] P:1506.02 E:0.036455 |  Cristiana Ronaldo, the take-one for Manchester United.
[9242.60 - 9245.80] P:1525.21 E:0.036417 |  And absolutely certain, Frank Lampard and Michael Ballak,
[9245.80 - 9247.96] P:1398.70 E:0.036230 |  and probably Nicholas and Nelgrove, I think,
[9247.96 - 9250.36] P:1369.00 E:0.044166 |  will be taking them for Chelsea.
[9250.36 - 9253.88] P:1476.41 E:0.038840 |  I think we've got a minute now to go about it's time.
[9254.84 - 9257.80] P:1528.32 E:0.038545 |  Obviously the game stopped because of the injuries.
[9257.80 - 9261.48] P:1477.33 E:0.040315 |  Ryan Giggs has just been called over now for some final words,
[9261.48 - 9263.56] P:1848.05 E:0.036111 |  final instruction, really, from Sir Alex Ferguson,
[9263.56 - 9264.60] P:1564.30 E:0.037690 |  to see whether United...
[9264.60 - 9267.72] P:1489.36 E:0.037978 |  Remember how late they left it in Barcelona?
[9267.72 - 9271.96] P:1604.22 E:0.035720 |  Narni's got a plaster on his head wound.
[9271.96 - 9275.40] P:1728.07 E:0.037289 |  It was Ashley Cole, who was the Chelsea player who was injured.
[9275.40 - 9279.40] P:1755.02 E:0.035152 |  I think Ashley Cole actually will be a potential penalty taker.
[9279.40 - 9281.48] P:1686.22 E:0.038148 |  Seen him taken, some good ones over the years.
[9281.48 - 9283.00] P:1693.60 E:0.039901 |  Like Anderson's coming on, isn't it?
[9283.08 - 9283.96] P:1826.82 E:0.040559 |  Anderson's coming on.
[9283.96 - 9286.84] P:1834.67 E:0.036933 |  There's no sign of Shevchenko, by the way, coming on.
[9287.64 - 9291.16] P:1709.82 E:0.041872 |  But we think Anderson, who maybe is a designated penalty taker,
[9292.68 - 9294.04] P:1770.34 E:0.034937 |  but they'll have to be quick.
[9294.04 - 9296.84] P:1726.81 E:0.036350 |  We haven't got too long to go as Czech clears,
[9296.84 - 9299.00] P:1902.21 E:0.042043 |  and maybe that's why he is wearing the orange,
[9299.00 - 9300.28] P:1893.36 E:0.033735 |  to try and confuse them all.
[9300.84 - 9303.48] P:1724.39 E:0.037050 |  Now, Evra for Manchester United.
[9303.48 - 9305.00] P:1852.55 E:0.044777 |  One last well-downfield.
[9305.00 - 9308.12] P:1888.51 E:0.035947 |  Ronaldo, that's a tired touch from Ronaldo.
[9308.12 - 9309.16] P:1757.99 E:0.039382 |  Esi and D'Anaisin.
[9309.16 - 9311.08] P:1719.18 E:0.042612 |  Ronaldo to the unmarked, Michael Carrick.
[9312.04 - 9315.24] P:1961.26 E:0.040380 |  Carrick now, swings the ball across to the far side of the field.
[9315.24 - 9316.28] P:1963.12 E:0.045079 |  Narni knocks it in.
[9316.28 - 9318.12] P:1829.02 E:0.041963 |  Terry Stretches doesn't really get it away.
[9318.68 - 9319.72] P:1796.20 E:0.044326 |  Narni again.
[9319.72 - 9321.96] P:1730.82 E:0.034548 |  Still Narni for Manchester United.
[9321.96 - 9323.88] P:1735.85 E:0.042432 |  Ronaldo on the edge of the area.
[9323.88 - 9327.32] P:1600.35 E:0.038615 |  Benzit in towards Tevez, who off-balance, can't control his header.
[9327.32 - 9328.68] P:1772.28 E:0.038074 |  And now if they're going to make the change,
[9328.68 - 9330.36] P:1861.82 E:0.036171 |  they really need to do it now,
[9330.36 - 9332.52] P:1782.97 E:0.033245 |  because we've seconds to go here in Moscow.
[9332.52 - 9334.20] P:1796.96 E:0.039236 |  Yes, the change is being made now.
[9336.28 - 9337.96] P:1682.44 E:0.050682 |  And Chelsea are making one as well.
[9338.68 - 9340.60] P:1709.94 E:0.031344 |  Belletti, not Shevchenko.
[9340.60 - 9341.80] P:1633.04 E:0.042896 |  Belletti for McAlely.
[9343.00 - 9345.80] P:1736.63 E:0.044609 |  And Anderson to come on for Manchester United.
[9346.36 - 9349.72] P:1673.84 E:0.037437 |  No idea at the moment who's coming off to make way for Anderson.
[9350.84 - 9353.48] P:1832.19 E:0.047212 |  So Belletti, who remember made such a huge impact
[9354.44 - 9356.68] P:1753.75 E:0.045426 |  for Barcelona coming on as a substitute
[9357.24 - 9359.88] P:1798.29 E:0.036702 |  against Arsenal in the Champions League final.
[9360.76 - 9363.24] P:1778.87 E:0.042076 |  Belletti comes on, McAlely makes way.
[9364.04 - 9368.20] P:1726.03 E:0.035433 |  And there's some delay here before Anderson comes on for Manchester United.
[9368.20 - 9370.12] P:1710.38 E:0.037570 |  They just can't seem to get the message across here.
[9370.12 - 9371.56] P:1576.88 E:0.037972 |  Or maybe they haven't decided.
[9371.56 - 9375.40] P:1772.71 E:0.034732 |  Alex Ferguson's out there and then signals Wes Brown to come off.
[9376.12 - 9378.12] P:1798.92 E:0.043483 |  So those are the final changes in the game.
[9378.12 - 9380.20] P:1794.05 E:0.047593 |  Yeah, Hargrove's going back to write that walk
[9380.20 - 9382.04] P:1829.67 E:0.038577 |  for the last minute of extra time.
[9382.04 - 9384.76] P:1673.20 E:0.040033 |  But they are, you know, to get the penalty taken on,
[9384.76 - 9385.96] P:1433.19 E:0.037595 |  there's no doubt about that.
[9388.28 - 9392.36] P:1783.33 E:0.036890 |  It is 20 pass one in the morning in Moscow.
[9393.08 - 9398.20] P:1659.76 E:0.035390 |  And the Champions League trophy still waiting to be presented here.
[9398.92 - 9400.36] P:1900.64 E:0.049975 |  John Terry's diving head.
[9400.36 - 9401.48] P:1738.15 E:0.042643 |  That's the end of the final.
[9402.52 - 9405.64] P:1780.63 E:0.042998 |  So Anderson and Belletti have come on, presumably,
[9405.64 - 9407.16] P:1793.63 E:0.040179 |  to be involved in the penalties,
[9407.96 - 9410.04] P:1770.04 E:0.047430 |  which is exactly what we're going to have here now
[9410.60 - 9413.00] P:1701.06 E:0.043351 |  as a result of the final score here being 1-1.
[9413.56 - 9415.64] P:1788.28 E:0.035332 |  And I'm sure you've been with us.
[9415.64 - 9418.92] P:1758.20 E:0.035379 |  And just in case you've recently joined the commentary on BBC Radio,
[9418.92 - 9421.64] P:1737.23 E:0.041278 |  United's first half, they led through Ronaldo.
[9421.64 - 9423.88] P:1682.48 E:0.040026 |  They could have had other opportunities to score.
[9423.88 - 9427.00] P:1818.37 E:0.034381 |  Check made a double save, which was fantastic for Chelsea.
[9427.00 - 9428.36] P:1614.11 E:0.041169 |  Still could be very important.
[9429.32 - 9431.16] P:1908.50 E:0.039930 |  Half-time approaching when Lampard scored,
[9431.16 - 9432.92] P:1650.23 E:0.041554 |  he got a couple of lucky ricochets,
[9432.92 - 9435.56] P:1650.27 E:0.037545 |  and then Chelsea built on that in the second half.
[9435.56 - 9437.24] P:1736.84 E:0.039003 |  They hit the post twice in the game.
[9437.80 - 9442.12] P:1715.65 E:0.034031 |  And so at 1-1 here, we have another penalty shootout.
[9442.12 - 9445.16] P:1651.18 E:0.042968 |  Thank you, Mike Ingram. 0-500-909-693.
[9445.16 - 9447.56] P:1641.63 E:0.042217 |  The lines are open after the presentation
[9447.56 - 9449.88] P:1727.94 E:0.036894 |  of the European Champions League Cup.
[9449.88 - 9452.52] P:1749.09 E:0.040068 |  Dwight of Manchester United or Chelsea after penalties.
[9452.52 - 9455.72] P:1523.98 E:0.039981 |  Alan Green will be with you for a full hour tonight.
[9455.72 - 9460.92] P:1698.44 E:0.033692 |  Whatever time we finish here in the Luzhnitsky Stadium in Moscow.
[9460.92 - 9462.28] P:1779.84 E:0.035419 |  But penalties speak for themselves.
[9462.28 - 9465.32] P:1568.51 E:0.039028 |  Stan Collimore, Didier Dragbo, what on earth was he doing?
[9465.32 - 9467.24] P:1712.68 E:0.032925 |  I mean, that is the bad side of him,
[9467.24 - 9470.60] P:1785.83 E:0.033453 |  and that is why some of those Chelsea fans behind the goal,
[9470.60 - 9473.64] P:1569.26 E:0.033810 |  although they love him as a player, won't be sad to see him go.
[9473.64 - 9476.76] P:1645.61 E:0.039395 |  No, if it is to be his last game in a Chelsea shirt,
[9476.76 - 9478.52] P:1637.20 E:0.041366 |  it's a real ignominious end, isn't it?
[9478.52 - 9481.96] P:1674.10 E:0.036790 |  He walked away down in that corner towards the Chelsea fans,
[9481.96 - 9485.08] P:1553.13 E:0.038184 |  and it was almost like a cricket out for a duck at the MCC.
[9485.72 - 9488.60] P:1330.13 E:0.038032 |  They all turned away, no applause for him.
[9488.60 - 9491.72] P:1511.88 E:0.039790 |  But going back to the penalty shootout, what they've got to do,
[9491.72 - 9494.04] P:1450.79 E:0.037191 |  and I'm sure they've been doing this week,
[9494.04 - 9497.40] P:1356.28 E:0.036767 |  is whoever takes them is to make your mind up
[9497.40 - 9499.72] P:1567.26 E:0.034585 |  before you walk up and stick to it.
[9499.72 - 9501.80] P:1432.23 E:0.042359 |  Don't be fazed by whoever's behind,
[9501.80 - 9505.32] P:1473.71 E:0.037152 |  whichever goal they are shooting at,
[9505.32 - 9507.32] P:1406.93 E:0.038287 |  whoever's obviously the goalkeepers,
[9507.32 - 9509.48] P:1316.71 E:0.046540 |  are going to be there doing their very best to put them off,
[9509.48 - 9510.84] P:1399.44 E:0.032733 |  to move across the line,
[9510.84 - 9513.08] P:1521.95 E:0.037693 |  make your mind up early mark and stick to it.
[9513.08 - 9516.12] P:1482.25 E:0.028513 |  That is the most important thing in penalty taking.
[9516.12 - 9518.28] P:1851.14 E:0.044889 |  Grogbrook of course had the real chance for Chelsea.
[9518.28 - 9519.40] P:1933.79 E:0.042240 |  I mean, a terrific effort.
[9519.40 - 9521.56] P:1993.94 E:0.033364 |  It's not the only thing he's done in the game that much,
[9521.56 - 9523.00] P:1724.41 E:0.032273 |  but he hit the post there.
[9523.00 - 9525.24] P:1514.63 E:0.040302 |  Yeah, very good backlift, very quick.
[9525.24 - 9527.40] P:1705.99 E:0.036507 |  It came to him and he was almost leaning back
[9527.40 - 9528.76] P:1330.98 E:0.040075 |  in exactly what he wanted to do,
[9528.76 - 9530.60] P:1771.69 E:0.040699 |  and in that split second managed to do it.
[9530.60 - 9533.32] P:1446.25 E:0.035298 |  Ball whipped in, came off that left hand post.
[9533.32 - 9535.00] P:1461.52 E:0.034365 |  Frank Lampard, of course.
[9535.00 - 9536.12] P:1264.10 E:0.044758 |  What an ending that would have been
[9536.12 - 9538.92] P:1489.51 E:0.036536 |  if it were a two-goal blast in the Champions League final
[9538.92 - 9540.52] P:1497.78 E:0.034818 |  with the season that he's had.
[9541.08 - 9543.40] P:1479.98 E:0.040842 |  He dug it out and it nearly hit the underside of the bar.
[9543.40 - 9545.00] P:1616.55 E:0.047932 |  I mean, he was so unlucky.
[9545.00 - 9548.20] P:1687.88 E:0.042510 |  I mean, it was sort of after you there, Ballak really set him up,
[9548.20 - 9549.80] P:1781.49 E:0.036886 |  rather he could have had a go himself.
[9549.80 - 9552.76] P:1556.25 E:0.036601 |  Absolutely. Just looking at the statistics,
[9552.76 - 9554.28] P:1649.49 E:0.038533 |  distance covered Manchester United,
[9554.28 - 9559.88] P:1474.40 E:0.038558 |  139.56 kilometres to Chelsea's 144.93 kilometres,
[9559.88 - 9561.48] P:1532.40 E:0.035408 |  where they get these figures from.
[9561.48 - 9563.00] P:1625.86 E:0.044654 |  But it just gives you an idea
[9563.00 - 9565.88] P:1479.21 E:0.031883 |  how much ground both sides have covered this evening.
[9565.88 - 9567.88] P:1765.45 E:0.035900 |  Well, Chelsea are now in this little huddle.
[9567.88 - 9569.48] P:1626.14 E:0.038203 |  Abram Grant is in the middle of it too.
[9570.52 - 9574.76] P:1597.35 E:0.036572 |  And it's all down to really now a bit of luck,
[9574.76 - 9578.12] P:1412.47 E:0.029083 |  a bit of nerve and a shot on target.
[9578.12 - 9580.36] P:1637.26 E:0.043244 |  Absolutely. Just saying shots on target there.
[9580.36 - 9583.96] P:1701.84 E:0.040857 |  Chelsea had doubled 24 to Manchester United to 12.
[9584.68 - 9586.20] P:1672.04 E:0.044605 |  So Chelsea without a doubt,
[9586.76 - 9588.60] P:1396.40 E:0.041997 |  they've had the best of it in front of goal,
[9588.60 - 9590.36] P:1611.97 E:0.033501 |  but it's still stalemate.
[9590.36 - 9593.08] P:1334.57 E:0.038304 |  And like I say, the players are just walking away now.
[9593.08 - 9597.56] P:1323.69 E:0.037196 |  So in Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Carrick, Nani Anderson,
[9598.52 - 9601.48] P:1264.76 E:0.043460 |  Owen Hargreaves, all there,
[9601.48 - 9604.76] P:1569.32 E:0.039742 |  Viddic, all the players walking over Manchester United.
[9604.76 - 9608.12] P:1506.42 E:0.032651 |  Chelsea still in their huddle, waiting to take those penalties.
[9608.12 - 9610.28] P:1657.47 E:0.043727 |  Plus that little bit of nastiness that we had at the end.
[9610.28 - 9611.96] P:1677.49 E:0.043001 |  They've been a bit niggly all the way through.
[9611.96 - 9613.24] P:1737.11 E:0.038719 |  It's sort of quite similar, I think,
[9613.24 - 9615.88] P:1692.74 E:0.036807 |  obviously to the groundsmen's incident at the end
[9615.88 - 9618.20] P:1820.87 E:0.038179 |  after the warm-down during the league game.
[9618.20 - 9620.60] P:1665.35 E:0.035053 |  You know, they just sort of carried on a bit, haven't they?
[9620.60 - 9621.24] P:1689.62 E:0.038902 |  So few of them.
[9621.24 - 9624.12] P:1612.83 E:0.040517 |  I mean, McAleely was at it throughout the whole game as well.
[9624.12 - 9626.04] P:1748.04 E:0.039984 |  Absolutely. And there's huge stakes.
[9626.04 - 9628.28] P:1569.47 E:0.038504 |  I mean, what we must never try to do, you know,
[9628.28 - 9631.08] P:1691.47 E:0.039060 |  we're in a stadium now, it's wonderful, you know,
[9631.08 - 9635.56] P:1858.03 E:0.035463 |  both sets of supporters and these days, physical contact.
[9635.56 - 9639.24] P:1691.98 E:0.040979 |  Just seeing Frank Lampard giving the Chelsea supporters an applause,
[9639.24 - 9642.28] P:1686.07 E:0.035314 |  getting them to raise their voices.
[9642.28 - 9645.00] P:1571.65 E:0.042526 |  But what we don't want is a lack of physical contact.
[9646.28 - 9648.76] P:1776.99 E:0.047132 |  Well, the referee walks towards the end,
[9648.76 - 9651.64] P:1881.31 E:0.039450 |  which behind the Manchester United fans are behind down there.
[9651.64 - 9652.36] P:1962.57 E:0.038910 |  So that's the end.
[9652.36 - 9655.08] P:1843.29 E:0.032915 |  It's to our left where these penalties are going to start.
[9655.88 - 9659.32] P:1575.52 E:0.034132 |  And, well, Stan Collin will be saying that they've had something
[9659.32 - 9663.08] P:1667.31 E:0.037618 |  like 135 kilometres to cover Chelsea.
[9664.04 - 9666.76] P:1453.03 E:0.044971 |  It's not a long walk, but it'll feel like a long walk
[9666.76 - 9669.16] P:1543.02 E:0.033304 |  if the strikers come back without scoring the goals.
[9669.88 - 9672.28] P:1761.43 E:0.043204 |  Penalty shootout in the Champions League final now
[9672.84 - 9675.00] P:1705.90 E:0.035258 |  between Chelsea and Manchester United.
[9675.96 - 9676.84] P:1415.73 E:0.042132 |  Here's Alan Green.
[9678.36 - 9681.40] P:1510.21 E:0.043257 |  And certainly it will be Carlos Tavez to take the first penalty kick
[9681.48 - 9683.72] P:1488.32 E:0.032801 |  in this shootout.
[9685.72 - 9688.60] P:1621.96 E:0.041021 |  For Manchester United, of course, Peter Check will be in goal.
[9690.12 - 9693.72] P:1730.49 E:0.038639 |  United have lost both their shootouts in European club competition.
[9694.52 - 9698.92] P:1604.43 E:0.038472 |  And I was commentating on an absolutely incredibly miserable night,
[9699.48 - 9705.32] P:1753.94 E:0.033858 |  also in Moscow, 16 years ago, from a bus with Jimmy Arnfield.
[9705.32 - 9706.36] P:1462.91 E:0.044964 |  We'll never forget it.
[9707.32 - 9709.48] P:1658.73 E:0.043320 |  That was in a slightly different arena to this one.
[9710.12 - 9712.92] P:1863.16 E:0.037424 |  Here's Tavez to try to put United in front,
[9712.92 - 9714.76] P:1653.87 E:0.044567 |  and he shoots United in front.
[9714.76 - 9715.96] P:1636.25 E:0.039932 |  Check went to the right.
[9715.96 - 9719.16] P:1624.77 E:0.037329 |  The penalty went to his left and United are a penalty up.
[9719.80 - 9721.96] P:1747.55 E:0.038126 |  Excellent start from Manchester United there.
[9722.60 - 9724.52] P:1650.99 E:0.046074 |  It came around it very, very well.
[9725.24 - 9729.24] P:1899.73 E:0.040258 |  I mean, my view is it's no excuse for a softly hitting penalty
[9729.24 - 9730.52] P:1978.62 E:0.044594 |  unless you score.
[9730.52 - 9733.64] P:1996.73 E:0.040070 |  I think you've got to get your accuracy, you've got to get your pace,
[9733.64 - 9736.04] P:1958.15 E:0.040265 |  and you've got to know exactly where you're going to put it.
[9736.92 - 9739.80] P:2024.57 E:0.042976 |  And certainly Tavez did extremely well then.
[9741.64 - 9743.80] P:1953.96 E:0.039114 |  Germans never miss penalties.
[9744.36 - 9748.60] P:1901.42 E:0.039847 |  And Michael Balak, of course, put one away recently
[9749.88 - 9752.28] P:1934.87 E:0.044525 |  against Manchester United in the Premier League.
[9753.56 - 9759.40] P:1897.38 E:0.041013 |  So it's Michael Balak against Edwin van der Zarr here in the penalty shootout.
[9759.40 - 9761.00] P:1839.47 E:0.040992 |  Balak studies himself and scores.
[9761.00 - 9763.80] P:1662.72 E:0.040389 |  I mean, was there any doubt ever about that?
[9764.68 - 9766.92] P:1717.97 E:0.039996 |  Van der Zarr was nowhere near it, and it's 1-1.
[9767.56 - 9770.12] P:1590.23 E:0.041743 |  Once again there it goes on that pace and power,
[9770.12 - 9772.04] P:1711.41 E:0.037844 |  knew exactly what he was doing.
[9772.04 - 9775.64] P:1767.13 E:0.042426 |  Even if you go, keep your nose away, they're going to do very well
[9775.64 - 9777.88] P:1881.46 E:0.033926 |  to get a hand to those kind of penalties.
[9778.84 - 9782.44] P:1936.22 E:0.040364 |  The penalties are being taken at the end to the left,
[9782.44 - 9785.48] P:1890.86 E:0.036300 |  behind which are the Manchester United supporters.
[9786.60 - 9789.56] P:1881.51 E:0.039198 |  So here is Michael Carrick.
[9790.52 - 9794.92] P:1788.82 E:0.040824 |  Right footed, and again he's checked very comfortably.
[9794.92 - 9799.00] P:1607.80 E:0.039862 |  Check went the wrong way, and Carrick bulleted the ball into the net.
[9799.00 - 9803.64] P:1791.02 E:0.036956 |  Yes, and then when the wrong way, she had to put it to checked left.
[9803.64 - 9806.60] P:1919.83 E:0.036919 |  Swung it with that power into the right-hand side.
[9806.60 - 9809.40] P:1889.13 E:0.035703 |  But three very, very good penalties so far.
[9809.40 - 9812.20] P:1972.76 E:0.035845 |  Well, this is why Baleti came on to take a penalty.
[9812.20 - 9815.88] P:1902.70 E:0.038983 |  By the way, the last time van der Zarr played in the Champions League final,
[9815.96 - 9818.28] P:1931.28 E:0.030161 |  he lost in a penalty shootout.
[9819.24 - 9823.24] P:1928.47 E:0.031890 |  This is his opportunity now to redress the balance.
[9825.16 - 9828.44] P:1898.71 E:0.037351 |  I'm tempted to say in Moscow, it's Russian rule XI.
[9829.00 - 9831.24] P:1900.26 E:0.037726 |  Penalty for Baleti and Chelsea,
[9832.44 - 9834.84] P:1920.23 E:0.035690 |  and at the moment they're 2-1 behind.
[9834.84 - 9839.80] P:1745.56 E:0.038429 |  Here comes Baleti, sends van der Zarr the wrong way, and it's 2-2.
[9841.00 - 9843.80] P:1706.35 E:0.036094 |  Just watching really as the goalkeeper's changed.
[9844.76 - 9848.44] P:1718.69 E:0.037385 |  Van der Zarr previously took an eternity to get up there.
[9848.44 - 9850.36] P:1819.10 E:0.041219 |  Baleti was waiting for him to come.
[9850.36 - 9853.48] P:1860.84 E:0.039214 |  Not so with Petr Cech, he's got himself into the goal.
[9854.20 - 9856.60] P:1862.10 E:0.042696 |  Do you think this shouldn't have finished before 2am?
[9857.96 - 9865.88] P:1829.69 E:0.037011 |  Here's Cristiano Ronaldo, who of course missed a penalty in the semi-final first leg away to Barcelona.
[9865.88 - 9867.32] P:1850.73 E:0.042031 |  So unusual for him.
[9868.52 - 9870.44] P:1877.30 E:0.035800 |  Will it be playing in his mind?
[9870.44 - 9873.32] P:1896.99 E:0.034308 |  Check crunching and the goal line.
[9873.40 - 9876.12] P:1843.75 E:0.037777 |  And Diver Orange, Ronaldo hesitated.
[9876.12 - 9878.44] P:1772.84 E:0.039411 |  No, he shouldn't! And Cech has made the save!
[9878.44 - 9880.36] P:1659.54 E:0.039480 |  Ronaldo's missed again!
[9880.36 - 9881.64] P:1634.30 E:0.042113 |  And van der Zarr!
[9883.16 - 9884.68] P:1639.49 E:0.046179 |  Could argue, trying to be clever.
[9885.24 - 9889.64] P:1642.44 E:0.039353 |  He's run up, stopped, tried to check him out,
[9890.20 - 9893.40] P:1621.09 E:0.041539 |  and then went in and checked himself as then read it.
[9895.88 - 9902.20] P:1669.52 E:0.037500 |  Well, Frank Lampard stepped up in the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool
[9903.00 - 9907.80] P:1782.93 E:0.037180 |  and this is his opportunity now to get Chelsea an advantage.
[9909.32 - 9912.28] P:1877.04 E:0.042579 |  So Ronaldo of all people has missed.
[9913.16 - 9916.12] P:1848.62 E:0.043650 |  And now if Lampard can keep his call, Chelsea will be in front.
[9916.76 - 9919.40] P:1683.69 E:0.045932 |  Lampard scores! Chelsea lead 3-2.
[9921.48 - 9923.64] P:1604.83 E:0.044350 |  Well, very, very confident, isn't it?
[9923.64 - 9927.96] P:1627.79 E:0.034746 |  You know the pressure on Lampard, the opposition just missed a penalty.
[9927.96 - 9930.60] P:1547.28 E:0.040409 |  And the pressure comes on you then, you know.
[9930.60 - 9932.76] P:1680.16 E:0.035287 |  If you can score, you put your team ahead.
[9932.76 - 9935.56] P:1787.58 E:0.034875 |  So very, very comfortable, excellent penalty.
[9936.84 - 9939.08] P:1880.26 E:0.041631 |  French time is being reached.
[9939.72 - 9946.36] P:1890.09 E:0.037522 |  It's on Hargreaves now from Manchester United, who trailed 3-2 and the penalty should out.
[9947.48 - 9954.44] P:1877.68 E:0.036691 |  Remember Chelsea lost in the semi-finals should out at Anfield last season in the Champions League.
[9955.08 - 9956.84] P:1907.25 E:0.044515 |  Hargreaves really needs to score.
[9957.40 - 9959.56] P:1830.83 E:0.038927 |  Right footed, checked out the right way,
[9959.64 - 9964.36] P:1670.23 E:0.037292 |  but it was a good penalty by the England player and their level 3-3 for the moment.
[9964.36 - 9965.72] P:1701.51 E:0.032124 |  Oh, it sure is, Mike.
[9965.72 - 9968.44] P:1570.77 E:0.042342 |  You were saying early, English player brought up in Germany.
[9969.24 - 9972.52] P:1618.58 E:0.035621 |  No problem whatsoever. What a good penalty that is.
[9972.52 - 9975.72] P:1829.84 E:0.039019 |  I've seen Ashley Cole take a few good penalties for Arsenal.
[9975.72 - 9976.84] P:1820.17 E:0.036826 |  Here he comes for Chelsea.
[9976.84 - 9980.92] P:1793.71 E:0.037894 |  Remember when Chelsea on this very night won the Cut Winners Cup?
[9980.92 - 9982.28] P:1665.50 E:0.044369 |  That was after a drawn game.
[9982.28 - 9983.88] P:1864.47 E:0.037004 |  They replayed two days later.
[9983.88 - 9985.40] P:1749.45 E:0.029115 |  They don't do that these days.
[9985.48 - 9990.36] P:1799.62 E:0.035635 |  Ashley Cole now has an opportunity to keep Chelsea in front.
[9990.36 - 9993.24] P:1852.54 E:0.041347 |  Ronaldo has missed, the only miss so far.
[9994.20 - 10001.08] P:1862.26 E:0.036411 |  Ashley Cole now, who lost in the Champions League final with Arsenal against Barcelona.
[10001.88 - 10006.84] P:1856.81 E:0.038382 |  Edwin van der Zal, just a little bit of gamesmanship there, talking to Cole.
[10006.84 - 10008.84] P:1875.67 E:0.041181 |  He's not going to have much of a run up here.
[10008.84 - 10010.52] P:1871.44 E:0.039882 |  He's going to take it left footed.
[10010.52 - 10012.12] P:1670.45 E:0.041205 |  Oh, and it's just crept in.
[10012.12 - 10014.12] P:1636.12 E:0.040515 |  It's just crept in off van der Zal's body.
[10015.40 - 10018.12] P:1639.01 E:0.043041 |  And Chelsea now lead 4-3.
[10018.92 - 10020.44] P:1832.72 E:0.045039 |  Seemed to go through, didn't he?
[10020.44 - 10022.44] P:1739.27 E:0.030340 |  Van der Zal read it correctly.
[10022.44 - 10024.36] P:1588.88 E:0.037862 |  Went to the right way.
[10024.36 - 10027.24] P:1571.46 E:0.035509 |  You look at the expressions of the Chelsea players there,
[10027.24 - 10028.36] P:1631.14 E:0.036935 |  but it's in the back of the net.
[10028.36 - 10029.32] P:1752.41 E:0.037249 |  That's all that matters.
[10030.68 - 10033.32] P:1784.39 E:0.033963 |  Now, it's very simple at this moment.
[10033.96 - 10037.32] P:1820.60 E:0.040363 |  Nani's going to take this penalty from Manchester United.
[10037.96 - 10043.96] P:1882.91 E:0.036719 |  If he misses, Chelsea are Champions of Europe for the very first time.
[10046.36 - 10049.16] P:1931.13 E:0.047239 |  What a responsibility on the young man's shoulders.
[10049.16 - 10050.68] P:1913.69 E:0.039726 |  He's already seen Ronaldo missed.
[10051.48 - 10053.48] P:1910.47 E:0.041413 |  It's a short run up for Nani.
[10053.48 - 10056.28] P:1881.78 E:0.035725 |  He's going to hit it right footed and check his beaten.
[10056.84 - 10058.20] P:1584.48 E:0.034165 |  It was an excellent penalty.
[10059.16 - 10060.04] P:1713.32 E:0.054037 |  Well, there is it.
[10060.04 - 10062.04] P:1696.15 E:0.040055 |  We talked, I was talking earlier about pressure.
[10062.68 - 10065.08] P:1456.56 E:0.046607 |  What more could there have been on that young man there?
[10065.08 - 10068.60] P:1739.10 E:0.040322 |  Just as a thing of Sir Alex Ferguson, a close-up there.
[10069.16 - 10070.76] P:1572.71 E:0.040276 |  What must be going through his mind?
[10071.64 - 10073.40] P:1626.12 E:0.040561 |  John Terry Chelsea captain.
[10073.48 - 10077.16] P:1650.73 E:0.033168 |  This is what is meant by leading from the front.
[10077.88 - 10082.04] P:1753.98 E:0.041655 |  John Terry, I mean, it's only a few days ago that he had a dislocated shoulder.
[10083.32 - 10088.92] P:1796.12 E:0.037923 |  He and Frank Lampard in particular have been so close to this holy grail for Chelsea.
[10088.92 - 10093.16] P:1766.99 E:0.038319 |  And how appropriate might it be if Chelsea are to win the Champions League
[10093.16 - 10098.52] P:1843.10 E:0.036784 |  for the first time in their history if the goal to take them to the glory is scored by this man?
[10099.40 - 10100.84] P:1790.49 E:0.040856 |  They're captain fantastic.
[10101.48 - 10103.96] P:1747.45 E:0.047377 |  John Terry has put it wide.
[10105.16 - 10106.04] P:1686.61 E:0.052056 |  He's missed it.
[10106.84 - 10109.48] P:1652.04 E:0.045468 |  He goes down in the penalty area.
[10110.28 - 10111.96] P:1681.36 E:0.043402 |  That was the opportunity.
[10111.96 - 10116.60] P:1633.34 E:0.040615 |  It has not been taken and Manchester United are alive again.
[10116.60 - 10119.32] P:1778.67 E:0.039628 |  I think he slipped, you know, just as he was taking it.
[10119.32 - 10120.36] P:1666.81 E:0.039053 |  Look, he does.
[10120.36 - 10122.20] P:1707.00 E:0.034884 |  His left foot slipped away from him.
[10123.08 - 10123.88] P:1414.22 E:0.053190 |  And there we are.
[10123.88 - 10124.52] P:1881.86 E:0.039834 |  It's a miss.
[10124.52 - 10126.36] P:1634.65 E:0.035089 |  We've seen that happen before.
[10126.36 - 10128.36] P:1553.74 E:0.039340 |  But his left boot went away from him.
[10128.36 - 10129.96] P:1708.98 E:0.032791 |  It slipped away from him.
[10129.96 - 10132.04] P:1674.49 E:0.040310 |  And he's taken the ball wide.
[10133.16 - 10136.12] P:1776.50 E:0.043853 |  Torrential rain in the Lesnicki Stadium in Moscow.
[10136.92 - 10139.16] P:1746.10 E:0.037897 |  Reprieve from Manchester United.
[10139.16 - 10142.28] P:1775.48 E:0.036111 |  And here's Anderson to put them in front in the shouldered.
[10142.28 - 10144.36] P:1722.73 E:0.039663 |  Left footed, driven in.
[10144.36 - 10145.64] P:1632.61 E:0.041896 |  Fantastic penalty.
[10150.68 - 10153.56] P:1748.02 E:0.044693 |  What a great deal of pace and power there.
[10153.56 - 10156.20] P:1711.22 E:0.036703 |  That was never done on target.
[10156.20 - 10158.28] P:1826.37 E:0.035610 |  Pace and power, certain goal.
[10158.52 - 10160.84] P:1828.24 E:0.025722 |  And how quickly things can turn around.
[10160.84 - 10163.88] P:1786.94 E:0.040145 |  Solomon Caloo wants to get on with this one quickly.
[10163.88 - 10167.00] P:1901.22 E:0.038965 |  He can't at the moment because Van Dazaar's not in his goal.
[10167.00 - 10172.28] P:1890.84 E:0.038713 |  Roman Abramovich can hardly bear to look in his city.
[10172.28 - 10174.68] P:1931.95 E:0.032993 |  This is beyond his control now.
[10174.68 - 10176.92] P:1871.47 E:0.037811 |  Caloo has to score.
[10176.92 - 10181.00] P:1927.29 E:0.029534 |  Or Manchester United win the Champions League.
[10181.00 - 10183.88] P:1879.78 E:0.034908 |  John Terry might have won it for Chelsea.
[10183.88 - 10187.00] P:1880.72 E:0.042894 |  Caloo has to score to keep them in the game and does.
[10187.32 - 10189.00] P:1680.97 E:0.034613 |  He scored it's 5-5.
[10189.00 - 10190.12] P:1728.59 E:0.044580 |  Very easy.
[10190.12 - 10192.28] P:1754.24 E:0.038363 |  Now I think he's going, he's a referee.
[10192.28 - 10194.36] P:1632.80 E:0.040112 |  I thought he was going to have a word with Van Dazaar.
[10194.36 - 10197.16] P:1656.42 E:0.036304 |  He needs to do because Van Dazaar, it's so obvious.
[10197.16 - 10200.12] P:1747.72 E:0.037206 |  Coming up so slowly, taking his time.
[10201.40 - 10203.16] P:1827.38 E:0.024490 |  Rand Giggs is next up.
[10205.00 - 10208.36] P:1924.75 E:0.036307 |  Well, the old man of this Manchester United team.
[10208.36 - 10212.36] P:1806.82 E:0.035964 |  Setting a record number of appearances for this club tonight.
[10212.52 - 10216.52] P:1772.71 E:0.035561 |  Surpassing the record previously held by Sir Bobby Charlton.
[10216.52 - 10220.52] P:1770.56 E:0.026623 |  It's 5-5 on penalties.
[10220.52 - 10222.52] P:1736.31 E:0.042053 |  We're in the extra time on penalties.
[10222.52 - 10225.08] P:1911.69 E:0.031377 |  Giggs left for it, easily beats Jack.
[10225.08 - 10227.08] P:1821.40 E:0.039815 |  Sends Jack the wrong way.
[10227.08 - 10231.32] P:1716.89 E:0.038679 |  Looks to put it as if he's going to put it in the right-hand corner.
[10231.32 - 10233.56] P:1644.75 E:0.041446 |  Swings it round to the left.
[10233.56 - 10235.32] P:1674.77 E:0.035617 |  Ball in the back of the net.
[10235.32 - 10237.08] P:1578.14 E:0.026408 |  Comfortable penalty.
[10237.08 - 10240.12] P:1656.97 E:0.030897 |  But the pressure is really on Chelsea.
[10240.28 - 10243.72] P:1747.17 E:0.034836 |  As long as Manchester United keep putting these penalties away.
[10243.72 - 10246.28] P:1749.71 E:0.044433 |  And their latest player to step up.
[10246.28 - 10250.68] P:1755.36 E:0.029461 |  Who's been quite a maverick really, had a roller coaster career.
[10250.68 - 10253.08] P:1746.18 E:0.042647 |  Nicholas Anelka.
[10253.08 - 10259.08] P:1853.71 E:0.031091 |  Anelka, just to repeat now, has to put this penalty away for Chelsea.
[10259.08 - 10261.56] P:1889.99 E:0.038503 |  To keep them in the Champions League final.
[10261.56 - 10265.56] P:1885.84 E:0.038818 |  Van Dazaar tries to spread himself as wide as he can.
[10266.52 - 10270.52] P:1789.03 E:0.046897 |  And makes the same for Manchester United.
[10270.52 - 10274.52] P:1613.35 E:0.045975 |  Van Dazaar denies Anelka.
[10274.52 - 10276.52] P:1601.07 E:0.044884 |  Denies Chelsea.
[10276.52 - 10278.52] P:1624.48 E:0.042632 |  And the new city famous for Red Square.
[10278.52 - 10280.52] P:1590.29 E:0.048509 |  It's a red night here in Moscow.
[10280.52 - 10284.52] P:1582.49 E:0.045542 |  As Manchester United once again become Champions of Europe.
[10290.52 - 10292.52] P:1624.15 E:0.050901 |  It's an extraordinary moment.
[10292.52 - 10294.52] P:1782.63 E:0.043748 |  Manchester United, the whole team of God,
[10295.48 - 10298.52] P:1703.31 E:0.041908 |  Ronaldo who is lying face down on the turf.
[10298.52 - 10300.52] P:1725.80 E:0.037945 |  Crys of joy from him.
[10300.52 - 10302.52] P:1675.99 E:0.038928 |  And just ten yards away.
[10302.52 - 10304.52] P:1731.77 E:0.033982 |  John Terry stooped.
[10304.52 - 10306.52] P:1657.84 E:0.037231 |  Hands in head.
[10306.52 - 10308.52] P:1672.02 E:0.049583 |  Obviously crying his eyes out there.
[10308.52 - 10310.52] P:1787.50 E:0.040384 |  What have I done?
[10310.52 - 10312.52] P:1709.90 E:0.035925 |  He had the chance to win it for Chelsea.
[10312.52 - 10314.52] P:1607.46 E:0.037682 |  For the first time.
[10314.52 - 10318.52] P:1699.38 E:0.038369 |  And Roman Abramovich is home city of Moscow.
[10318.52 - 10320.52] P:1740.15 E:0.039101 |  He is inconsolable.
[10320.52 - 10322.52] P:1733.14 E:0.039587 |  Ronaldo knows that he's got away with it.
[10322.52 - 10324.52] P:1812.03 E:0.041941 |  He absolutely knows he's got away with it.
[10324.52 - 10330.52] P:1706.29 E:0.039111 |  And John Terry knows it is probably his worst moment in football.
[10330.52 - 10332.52] P:1672.68 E:0.039173 |  Frank Lampard is now over there.
[10332.52 - 10334.52] P:1617.40 E:0.035423 |  Consoling him.
[10334.52 - 10338.52] P:1740.05 E:0.038269 |  Terry's head on Lampard's shoulder.
[10338.52 - 10342.52] P:1676.09 E:0.037650 |  And Ryan Gibbs, the Sol Manchester United player who goes over there.
[10342.52 - 10344.52] P:1620.76 E:0.034302 |  And says hard luck.
[10344.52 - 10346.52] P:1645.39 E:0.044070 |  Stan Collimore.
[10346.52 - 10348.52] P:1705.34 E:0.044346 |  This game can be so cruel.
[10348.52 - 10350.52] P:1512.09 E:0.042999 |  It can be so exciting.
[10350.52 - 10354.52] P:1614.04 E:0.038194 |  One way or the other, Mike and Alan were talking about that.
[10354.52 - 10356.52] P:1579.91 E:0.040298 |  Who would become the hero?
[10356.52 - 10358.52] P:1709.66 E:0.038625 |  Who the villain?
[10358.52 - 10360.52] P:1488.85 E:0.039314 |  Whose night might become a long, long one?
[10360.52 - 10362.52] P:1567.72 E:0.045139 |  It's having the Chelsea into John Terry.
[10362.52 - 10366.52] P:1591.71 E:0.042052 |  Manchester United are champions of Europe for the third time.
[10366.52 - 10370.52] P:1535.56 E:0.038904 |  Sir Alex Ferguson for the second time.
[10370.52 - 10372.52] P:1549.40 E:0.045195 |  Oh my word.
[10372.52 - 10374.52] P:1550.98 E:0.044403 |  Did the pitch change it with Terry there?
[10374.52 - 10376.52] P:1530.26 E:0.044333 |  His leg is standing.
[10376.52 - 10378.52] P:1509.51 E:0.041435 |  He did.
[10378.52 - 10380.52] P:1479.97 E:0.033715 |  The second wasn't it.
[10380.52 - 10382.52] P:1683.40 E:0.039993 |  Went up to take the penalty.
[10382.52 - 10384.52] P:1634.10 E:0.031920 |  And just at that critical moment,
[10384.52 - 10386.52] P:1651.99 E:0.033660 |  everything seemed to stop.
[10386.52 - 10388.52] P:1685.35 E:0.045326 |  He put the ball wide.
[10388.52 - 10392.52] P:1714.57 E:0.034543 |  And John Terry, the captain, so much of the vanguard of his Chelsea side.
[10392.52 - 10395.52] P:1575.92 E:0.037937 |  He's seen the growth of the club right the way to Abramovich.
[10395.52 - 10398.52] P:1646.89 E:0.034865 |  Well, congratulations to Manchester United.
[10398.52 - 10400.52] P:1689.89 E:0.043625 |  Well, John Terry has now got his manager,
[10400.52 - 10402.52] P:1722.25 E:0.041833 |  Avram Grant looking after him over there.
[10402.52 - 10404.52] P:1647.00 E:0.030468 |  More consoling for the Chelsea captain
[10404.52 - 10406.52] P:1727.24 E:0.038124 |  who is distraught at this moment.
[10406.52 - 10410.52] P:1760.15 E:0.040403 |  Vandessaar, who's been the other side of a penalty shootout in a final before,
[10410.52 - 10412.52] P:1625.87 E:0.038679 |  has punched the air.
[10412.52 - 10414.52] P:1639.71 E:0.039250 |  Manchester United, Wayne Rooney,
[10414.52 - 10416.52] P:1685.49 E:0.039634 |  who threw his shirt off when he was substituted,
[10416.52 - 10418.52] P:1734.98 E:0.041501 |  has got it back on now.
[10418.52 - 10421.52] P:1674.14 E:0.037004 |  And he stands alongside the only Mancunian in the team,
[10421.52 - 10423.52] P:1559.21 E:0.042325 |  Wes Brown, as they do a jig of delight.
[10423.52 - 10426.52] P:1730.65 E:0.040934 |  They're joined now by the rest of the United side.
[10426.52 - 10428.52] P:1550.73 E:0.035615 |  Tevez is in there.
[10428.52 - 10430.52] P:1693.07 E:0.040977 |  So too is Anderson.
[10430.52 - 10432.52] P:1624.81 E:0.034527 |  So too is Carrick.
[10432.52 - 10434.52] P:1597.83 E:0.040737 |  They're suddenly realizing what they've done.
[10434.52 - 10436.52] P:1651.63 E:0.040577 |  And he is wisdom.
[10436.52 - 10438.52] P:1618.47 E:0.042304 |  As the whole of the Manchester United side
[10438.52 - 10440.52] P:1497.80 E:0.035589 |  grouped down in front of me to the left here,
[10440.52 - 10442.52] P:1613.78 E:0.038679 |  to the cameras that have banked behind the corner flag.
[10442.52 - 10444.52] P:1675.65 E:0.039555 |  It is Manchester United's night.
[10444.52 - 10446.52] P:1807.75 E:0.040380 |  It is Fergie's night, what's more.
[10446.52 - 10449.52] P:1668.47 E:0.033977 |  Chelsea still stands stunned the way to my right.
[10449.52 - 10451.52] P:1692.26 E:0.043978 |  Calvario walks slowly around.
[10451.52 - 10453.52] P:1714.87 E:0.042273 |  Doesn't know what to do with himself.
[10453.52 - 10456.52] P:1546.49 E:0.038122 |  Ashley Cole stands with his hands on his hips,
[10456.52 - 10458.52] P:1574.18 E:0.030162 |  not knowing either what to do.
[10458.52 - 10461.52] P:1547.81 E:0.043347 |  And my word, there's a big deep breath needed for Chelsea,
[10461.52 - 10463.52] P:1691.11 E:0.041082 |  who had it.
[10463.52 - 10465.52] P:1617.91 E:0.035613 |  And he's led the Champions League.
[10465.52 - 10467.52] P:1629.51 E:0.034977 |  John Terry could not have strode forward
[10467.52 - 10469.52] P:1695.26 E:0.038101 |  with more confidence than he did.
[10469.52 - 10471.52] P:1588.18 E:0.034234 |  But he put it wide.
[10471.52 - 10473.52] P:1621.70 E:0.039566 |  It went on.
[10473.52 - 10475.52] P:1708.56 E:0.046970 |  And it's been finished by Van der Sar,
[10475.52 - 10479.52] P:1704.86 E:0.044184 |  who cannot believe what he's managed to do for Manchester United.
[10479.52 - 10481.52] P:1827.25 E:0.036634 |  He's away on the far side now,
[10481.52 - 10483.52] P:1886.41 E:0.034470 |  having slid across the cruising services
[10483.52 - 10485.52] P:1682.10 E:0.039238 |  and for the other photograph.
[10485.52 - 10487.52] P:1795.46 E:0.041485 |  And Manchester United found his way to my left here.
[10487.52 - 10489.52] P:1742.95 E:0.032391 |  Absolutely.
[10489.52 - 10491.52] P:1811.82 E:0.035739 |  In complete delight as Manchester United
[10491.52 - 10494.52] P:1716.26 E:0.041138 |  go on a half lap of honour here to start with.
[10494.52 - 10496.52] P:1565.22 E:0.041021 |  The surface is perfect for the dives
[10496.52 - 10498.52] P:1732.67 E:0.043256 |  as they all go to the far side of the penalty box.
[10498.52 - 10500.52] P:1766.20 E:0.040655 |  Chelsea fans away to my right.
[10500.52 - 10502.52] P:1674.63 E:0.038261 |  Absolutely stunned.
[10502.52 - 10504.52] P:1804.29 E:0.032256 |  This is all about Manchester United now.
[10504.52 - 10506.52] P:1763.75 E:0.034480 |  0-500-909-693.
[10506.52 - 10508.52] P:1664.21 E:0.039181 |  That's the number to ring Alan Green
[10508.52 - 10511.52] P:1606.06 E:0.039387 |  after the presentation here in Moscow tonight.
[10511.52 - 10514.52] P:1618.53 E:0.038607 |  If you want to be part of 0-606.
[10514.52 - 10516.52] P:1567.94 E:0.042397 |  Well, his penalty is in the end.
[10516.52 - 10518.52] P:1654.97 E:0.039035 |  It's more than just a final.
[10518.52 - 10520.52] P:1505.64 E:0.042891 |  It is a knockout final.
[10520.52 - 10522.52] P:1666.30 E:0.035728 |  Both of these sides.
[10522.52 - 10526.52] P:1597.38 E:0.038689 |  But Sir Alex Ferguson, with what is really his third Manchester United team,
[10526.52 - 10530.52] P:1616.92 E:0.034531 |  has finally taken his second Champions League title.
[10530.52 - 10533.52] P:1617.72 E:0.035826 |  Absolutely. I think there's been 16 managers
[10533.52 - 10538.52] P:1517.25 E:0.032671 |  that have done this with two championships to their credit.
[10538.52 - 10540.52] P:1486.92 E:0.040314 |  He's got one more.
[10540.52 - 10542.52] P:1415.97 E:0.034866 |  Just wonder whether that will revitalise him.
[10542.52 - 10546.52] P:1600.16 E:0.036841 |  Obviously they're chasing Liverpool in terms of championships, 18.
[10546.52 - 10548.52] P:1524.12 E:0.043786 |  And now Bob Pace's record,
[10548.52 - 10550.52] P:1436.31 E:0.038690 |  he's only this tournament, having won it one-three.
[10550.52 - 10552.52] P:1500.56 E:0.041478 |  Wouldn't surprise you at all, would it?
[10552.52 - 10555.52] P:1546.02 E:0.039343 |  Sir Alex Ferguson wakes up in the early hours of the morning
[10555.52 - 10558.52] P:1386.69 E:0.037692 |  and wants to attack that task in hands.
[10558.52 - 10560.52] P:1496.36 E:0.041593 |  Just seeing the Manchester United players,
[10560.52 - 10562.52] P:1306.94 E:0.034236 |  it's been a long, old season.
[10562.52 - 10565.52] P:1412.99 E:0.039519 |  But pound for pound for me, they've been the best side in Europe.
[10565.52 - 10569.52] P:1434.76 E:0.037311 |  And I've won the title last year and regained it.
[10569.52 - 10573.52] P:1442.81 E:0.038461 |  It is lovely to see a team that has won their domestic title
[10573.52 - 10576.52] P:1401.09 E:0.038253 |  to go on and rightfully be crowned as champions of Europe.
[10576.52 - 10579.52] P:1474.82 E:0.039214 |  Balak's in tears. It mattered to him.
[10579.52 - 10582.52] P:1555.19 E:0.040624 |  He's shown coolness throughout his career,
[10582.52 - 10586.52] P:1723.79 E:0.033608 |  but he's overcome with the emotion tonight as well.
[10586.52 - 10590.52] P:1690.33 E:0.032281 |  John Terry still inconsolable.
[10590.52 - 10593.52] P:1769.53 E:0.037918 |  He is in all sorts of agonies.
[10593.52 - 10596.52] P:1664.42 E:0.035502 |  Steve Clark has been trying to sort him out there.
[10596.52 - 10599.52] P:1656.67 E:0.038248 |  And the rest of Chelsea have this agonising weight now,
[10599.52 - 10603.52] P:1681.05 E:0.036882 |  as Manchester United will make their way towards...
[10603.52 - 10606.52] P:1734.71 E:0.039334 |  I'm so pleased to say it's the proper way
[10606.52 - 10610.52] P:1662.65 E:0.032415 |  to present a cup of this magnitude.
[10610.52 - 10616.52] P:1680.18 E:0.033930 |  It'll be an old-fashioned step-up for Manchester United.
[10616.52 - 10618.52] P:1611.34 E:0.041668 |  Champions League winners.
[10618.52 - 10620.52] P:1667.17 E:0.035992 |  The double is theirs.
[10620.52 - 10622.52] P:1647.07 E:0.041563 |  What a magnificent double for Fergie
[10622.52 - 10624.52] P:1656.83 E:0.043873 |  and for this young Manchester United side.
[10624.52 - 10627.52] P:1617.93 E:0.040141 |  This could just be the real beginnings of something great for them as well,
[10627.52 - 10630.52] P:1598.66 E:0.036184 |  with so many young players involved.
[10630.52 - 10634.52] P:1630.68 E:0.040047 |  Fergie said, I trust my young players to deliver for me.
[10634.52 - 10636.52] P:1587.78 E:0.032688 |  They've done just that.
[10636.52 - 10640.52] P:1685.72 E:0.037674 |  The only thing of five-life sport, it's been a great game.
[10640.52 - 10642.52] P:1594.30 E:0.042890 |  It's perhaps not been the greatest football,
[10642.52 - 10646.52] P:1609.61 E:0.032409 |  but it has had absolutely everything in it.
[10646.52 - 10650.52] P:1570.84 E:0.040747 |  And just one thought, if Drogba hadn't stupidly got himself sent off,
[10650.52 - 10654.52] P:1598.71 E:0.038887 |  would John Terry have stepped forward to have taken that penalty?
[10654.52 - 10658.52] P:1634.65 E:0.034896 |  But it's about winners and their Manchester United.
[10658.52 - 10660.52] P:1569.70 E:0.038081 |  Mike Inger.
[10660.52 - 10665.52] P:1591.13 E:0.033049 |  To get this trophy, he's urging everyone to join him.
[10665.52 - 10667.52] P:1762.63 E:0.042484 |  It can be a cruel game, though, can't it?
[10667.52 - 10670.52] P:1584.00 E:0.039584 |  I mean, for John Terry of all people to miss the penalty,
[10670.52 - 10674.52] P:1674.71 E:0.036066 |  I remember him really going through it after the penalty shootout in Germany,
[10674.52 - 10677.52] P:1552.04 E:0.031651 |  after the World Cup defeat by Portugal.
[10677.52 - 10679.52] P:1733.84 E:0.039644 |  He has just crumpled down there,
[10679.52 - 10683.52] P:1583.09 E:0.034719 |  but as much as they try and console him, Peter Kenney and I see down there,
[10683.52 - 10685.52] P:1806.47 E:0.041894 |  it's all now about Manchester United.
[10685.52 - 10688.52] P:1642.81 E:0.037366 |  They didn't have penalty shootouts, did they, 50 years ago?
[10688.52 - 10691.52] P:1624.61 E:0.032549 |  But 50 years on from the tragedy in Munich,
[10691.52 - 10694.52] P:1676.33 E:0.044276 |  there was that big banner around the stadium earlier on for the Babes.
[10694.52 - 10697.52] P:1623.72 E:0.036210 |  The Babes, of course, were attempting to win that European Cup
[10697.52 - 10700.52] P:1506.32 E:0.032111 |  when they were tragically killed.
[10700.52 - 10703.52] P:1570.03 E:0.034984 |  And 40 years, of course, now on from the success,
[10703.52 - 10710.52] P:1670.28 E:0.033803 |  the first success at Wembley, Manchester United have won the trophy once more.
[10710.52 - 10719.52] P:1665.60 E:0.036852 |  They will walk up the steps where they will be received by a great former player himself,
[10719.52 - 10724.52] P:1519.39 E:0.032306 |  Michel Platini, won the European Cup with Juventus,
[10724.52 - 10728.52] P:1605.53 E:0.039255 |  Edwin van der Zarre, who was on the other end of it,
[10728.52 - 10731.52] P:1731.75 E:0.037291 |  as Mark was saying the last time he played in the Champions League final.
[10731.52 - 10733.52] P:1731.34 E:0.038197 |  He lost in a penalty shootout.
[10733.52 - 10736.52] P:1599.61 E:0.039586 |  First of all, though, the officials are going to go up.
[10736.52 - 10741.52] P:1651.67 E:0.039273 |  Michel Platini's waiting for that big trophy, that big trophy to set.
[10741.52 - 10747.52] P:1637.70 E:0.035826 |  And we think, we think, a set, a combination of Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand.
[10747.52 - 10749.52] P:1618.82 E:0.037712 |  It takes a little lifting this trophy.
[10749.52 - 10752.52] P:1586.68 E:0.039203 |  We think they will be the men to lift it.
[10752.52 - 10756.52] P:1408.24 E:0.038031 |  Ryan Giggs, on the night that he breaks,
[10756.52 - 10760.52] P:1592.14 E:0.037174 |  Sabobi Charlton's record, climaxing a fantastic career.
[10760.52 - 10766.52] P:1561.82 E:0.031643 |  And Rio Ferdinand, who was the captain tonight at the start of the game.
[10768.52 - 10773.52] P:1626.67 E:0.038883 |  So, Luthos, Michel and his officials get their medals.
[10773.52 - 10776.52] P:1703.58 E:0.037212 |  Manchester United wait for their final instructions.
[10776.52 - 10780.52] P:1582.71 E:0.036016 |  Edwin van der Zarre sticks his tongue out at the camera.
[10780.52 - 10783.52] P:1661.48 E:0.042237 |  Nani's doing all sorts of jigs down there.
[10783.52 - 10789.52] P:1573.77 E:0.037080 |  And the Chelsea players just have to stand in the torrential rain down there and wait.
[10789.52 - 10795.52] P:1486.56 E:0.040208 |  And all the Chelsea fans are still in the end of way to our right
[10795.52 - 10798.52] P:1640.98 E:0.040034 |  just to say goodbye and thanks to their team for the season.
[10798.52 - 10802.52] P:1600.81 E:0.040215 |  So, Bobby Charlton, whose Mac is splattered by the rain down there.
[10802.52 - 10807.52] P:1630.25 E:0.036670 |  So, Bobby Charlton hugs Rio Ferdinand, the Manchester United captain,
[10807.52 - 10810.52] P:1524.53 E:0.031647 |  as they wait to make the walk.
[10810.52 - 10818.52] P:1725.78 E:0.037126 |  Wembley, 1968, the drama of 1999 against Bayern Munich in Barcelona.
[10818.52 - 10824.52] P:1606.66 E:0.037237 |  And Sir Alex Ferguson maintains his 100% record in European finals,
[10824.52 - 10828.52] P:1733.00 E:0.038036 |  beginning of course with Aberdeen and now very much so with the team
[10828.52 - 10832.52] P:1673.68 E:0.030133 |  that may be considered now to be his best at Manchester United.
[10833.52 - 10837.52] P:1691.16 E:0.041489 |  I just want to tell you what Pergui has said tonight is exactly that, Mike,
[10837.52 - 10840.52] P:1829.59 E:0.043157 |  because Manchester United just waiting really with a guard of honour for Chelsea,
[10840.52 - 10843.52] P:1839.89 E:0.037332 |  the losers, I guess, to come through first and get their losers medals,
[10843.52 - 10846.52] P:1731.77 E:0.040079 |  not that they want them. Pergui has said we deserved it,
[10846.52 - 10849.52] P:1744.78 E:0.035464 |  we had the best chances in the match. In extra time we got better.
[10849.52 - 10852.52] P:1737.01 E:0.035361 |  It was a fantastic achievement. He thought it was a good game
[10852.52 - 10859.52] P:1704.17 E:0.030679 |  and when asked he said yes, this is the best United team ever.
[10859.52 - 10862.52] P:1714.53 E:0.042852 |  Well, he was holding back on that because he was asked about it yesterday
[10862.52 - 10867.52] P:1725.84 E:0.043453 |  and his answer really was, well, let's see what happens tomorrow.
[10867.52 - 10871.52] P:1742.26 E:0.038532 |  Sir Alex shakes the hands of the officials down there.
[10871.52 - 10877.52] P:1662.99 E:0.038143 |  We understand that the survivors of the Munich disaster, Albert Scanlon
[10877.52 - 10882.52] P:1688.20 E:0.041422 |  and Harry Gregg and Kenny Morgan and Phil folks are here with Sir Bobby Charlton,
[10882.52 - 10888.52] P:1761.31 E:0.037368 |  but it will be Chelsea, first of all, led by their Chief Executive Peter Kenyon
[10888.52 - 10893.52] P:1701.93 E:0.040979 |  and John Terry and Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Michael Essian, Ricardo Cavallio,
[10893.52 - 10898.52] P:1709.70 E:0.038707 |  Belletti and then Nelka, it was his penalty miss in the end
[10898.52 - 10903.52] P:1722.81 E:0.039276 |  or should it be to say from Edwin van der Zarr which finally settled the issue here.
[10903.52 - 10906.52] P:1688.94 E:0.036304 |  It's a tough game, Brian Taylor, isn't it?
[10906.52 - 10911.52] P:1777.84 E:0.038275 |  It certainly is. The situation is that when you come to the penalties there,
[10911.52 - 10914.52] P:1514.86 E:0.044793 |  when we know there's going to be the hero, there's going to be the villain,
[10914.52 - 10918.52] P:1650.09 E:0.033279 |  you cannot alter it. Great tension, great excitement.
[10918.52 - 10923.52] P:1731.42 E:0.032117 |  But at the end of the day it's Manchester United that come out with the trophy.
[10923.52 - 10928.52] P:1612.26 E:0.030647 |  Abram Grant and there will be all sorts of conversations and things written
[10928.52 - 10931.52] P:1757.12 E:0.042939 |  over the next few days about where he goes from here.
[10931.52 - 10934.52] P:1686.52 E:0.041807 |  He did actually start his press conference yesterday with the words,
[10934.52 - 10936.52] P:1719.84 E:0.027827 |  can I go now?
[10936.52 - 10940.52] P:1678.95 E:0.040053 |  Well, I think that might be one of the questions that will be asked now about him.
[10940.52 - 10944.52] P:1692.68 E:0.040127 |  As Sir Peter Kenyon receives a shield from the Michel Platteney,
[10944.52 - 10948.52] P:1670.54 E:0.039958 |  there will be some consolation for John Terry, but no words really.
[10948.52 - 10951.52] P:1668.04 E:0.042170 |  Stan Collymora, as you can join us as well now,
[10951.52 - 10954.52] P:1731.19 E:0.039981 |  watching these pictures of an emotional John Terry.
[10954.52 - 10958.52] P:1639.46 E:0.042959 |  There's nothing anyone can say. I mean, Bruce Sput there is putting his arm around him,
[10958.52 - 10962.52] P:1644.62 E:0.035033 |  one of the Chelsea directors, but John Terry completely disgraced.
[10962.52 - 10966.52] P:1724.07 E:0.038953 |  He's a very proud man, John Terry. He loves this club.
[10966.52 - 10970.52] P:1664.61 E:0.038582 |  He's been here since, well, the very beginning of the revolution really.
[10970.52 - 10973.52] P:1633.05 E:0.036941 |  And just as we're seeing that the losers' medals being given to the players,
[10973.52 - 10977.52] P:1571.12 E:0.039527 |  they won't count for anything. They'll find their way into the back of a draw.
[10977.52 - 10981.52] P:1620.14 E:0.037368 |  But a poignant moment for me was Bobby Charlton going over to Rio Ferdinand
[10981.52 - 10983.52] P:1699.33 E:0.028162 |  and just tapping him on the chest.
[10983.52 - 10986.52] P:1757.98 E:0.037787 |  You can imagine him saying, enjoy this because these moments,
[10986.52 - 10990.52] P:1703.03 E:0.038256 |  whoever you play for, whether it be Manchester United, Chelsea or whoever,
[10990.52 - 10992.52] P:1381.24 E:0.036544 |  don't come across very often.
[10992.52 - 10996.52] P:1770.17 E:0.038078 |  Two players just receiving runners-up medals for the second time in their career.
[10996.52 - 10998.52] P:1590.69 E:0.037444 |  It's Ashley Cole and Michael Balak.
[10998.52 - 11002.52] P:1611.51 E:0.035696 |  I mean, that's not really Michael Balak's scene at all.
[11002.52 - 11005.52] P:1654.62 E:0.041113 |  He wanted to win that more than anybody down there tonight.
[11005.52 - 11008.52] P:1729.63 E:0.038262 |  And Avram Grant as well, who's soaked to the skin,
[11008.52 - 11013.52] P:1707.22 E:0.035838 |  also gets a pat and a word from Michel Platini.
[11013.52 - 11018.52] P:1712.94 E:0.038559 |  Chelsea, who have come close, of course, since the Abramovich area began,
[11018.52 - 11023.52] P:1661.85 E:0.040113 |  the semi-final defeat against Monaco, the semi-final defeats against Liverpool,
[11023.52 - 11027.52] P:1670.79 E:0.039162 |  the Manchester United players at the moment are forming some kind of guard of honour
[11027.52 - 11030.52] P:1589.15 E:0.040447 |  and patting the Chelsea players as they retreat.
[11030.52 - 11032.52] P:1509.53 E:0.044605 |  And they will go across to their own fans, Chelsea,
[11032.52 - 11038.52] P:1589.55 E:0.035668 |  but the stage is about to be Manchester United's once that final Chelsea player has come.
[11038.52 - 11042.52] P:1561.34 E:0.038187 |  In fact, it's going to be Avram Grant who makes the long walk finally.
[11042.52 - 11047.52] P:1598.18 E:0.040743 |  Remember his emotional scenes going down on his knees at the end of that victory
[11047.52 - 11050.52] P:1601.78 E:0.038804 |  over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.
[11050.52 - 11057.52] P:1671.47 E:0.043282 |  Well, now Avram Grant departs the scenes and it's going to be all about the team in red.
[11057.52 - 11063.52] P:1738.99 E:0.039962 |  And the unbelievable Sir Alex Ferguson, really, who, let's face it, a few years ago,
[11063.52 - 11065.52] P:1684.14 E:0.034769 |  was on the way out of Manchester United.
[11065.52 - 11071.52] P:1618.33 E:0.040499 |  The legend goes that it was his wife, Kathy, who talked him out of premature retirement.
[11071.52 - 11075.52] P:1666.27 E:0.036937 |  And the fact that Sir Bobby Charlton is down there, I'm just wondering, you know,
[11075.52 - 11078.52] P:1653.94 E:0.037602 |  whether he may go up ahead of the queue in the way that Peter Kenyon did,
[11078.52 - 11080.52] P:1663.29 E:0.035148 |  but let's not prejudge things here.
[11080.52 - 11084.52] P:1500.61 E:0.039614 |  Yeah, and when you see Sir Bobby Charlton there for people of a certain age,
[11084.52 - 11087.52] P:1577.54 E:0.041732 |  which includes myself, it's a great fear, I mean, fantastic.
[11087.52 - 11094.52] P:1621.08 E:0.035785 |  But as Sir Alex says, we're in the present now and he says this is the best United side that he's had.
[11094.52 - 11099.52] P:1699.71 E:0.038985 |  Here we go. Río Ferdinand has a white tile draped around his shoulders.
[11099.52 - 11105.52] P:1756.09 E:0.033855 |  Manchester United starts their march up the steps to Michel Platini.
[11105.52 - 11111.52] P:1740.00 E:0.040391 |  That big trophy with the big ears, the big handles is weighted to be lifted and it is.
[11112.52 - 11117.52] P:1777.72 E:0.038820 |  The hero from 1968, the Munich survivor, Sir Bobby Charlton,
[11117.52 - 11122.52] P:1683.97 E:0.034164 |  who will lead Manchester United up to the rostrum there.
[11122.52 - 11126.52] P:1782.86 E:0.033774 |  And just how moving and appropriate is that.
[11126.52 - 11130.52] P:1764.97 E:0.039829 |  Manchester United is the big flag being raised away to our left.
[11130.52 - 11133.52] P:1771.22 E:0.040017 |  Manchester United's great, great night of the realm.
[11133.52 - 11137.52] P:1669.35 E:0.041191 |  Sir Bobby Charlton on the night when Ryan Giggs has gone one appearance better,
[11137.52 - 11143.52] P:1781.43 E:0.040994 |  followed by the football of the year and maybe this year's European player of the year, Christiana Ronaldo.
[11143.52 - 11148.52] P:1740.98 E:0.036444 |  There's a big embrace between Sir Bobby and Michel Platini.
[11148.52 - 11153.52] P:1713.89 E:0.039481 |  Bobby Charlton is, in fact, urging Michel Platini not to put the medal around his neck,
[11153.52 - 11158.52] P:1738.29 E:0.042464 |  but he's got a shield and he's got another hug and now Christiana Ronaldo,
[11158.52 - 11164.52] P:1738.69 E:0.036873 |  who got the show on the road here tonight with the first goal, he receives his first Champions League medal.
[11164.52 - 11166.52] P:1736.69 E:0.039752 |  Edwin van der Zarr gets his second.
[11166.52 - 11170.52] P:1757.13 E:0.037742 |  I can see Patrice Evera lining up now, having missed out with Monaco.
[11170.52 - 11171.52] P:1670.21 E:0.036848 |  He's got it.
[11171.52 - 11176.52] P:1723.43 E:0.036929 |  There's a big hug now between Christiana Ronaldo and Sir Bobby Charlton.
[11176.52 - 11180.52] P:1779.13 E:0.033979 |  The past, of course, and very much the present.
[11180.52 - 11185.52] P:1729.09 E:0.037644 |  And Sir Alex Ferguson, head plastered by the rain here.
[11185.52 - 11188.52] P:1728.60 E:0.039268 |  This is what he's all about, winning the trophies.
[11188.52 - 11190.52] P:1759.12 E:0.037860 |  Ryan Giggs shakes his...
[11190.52 - 11199.52] P:1719.79 E:0.035853 |  It's going to be that combination again that we saw at Wigan of Rio Ferdinand wearing the yellow armband that says C on it,
[11199.52 - 11208.52] P:1656.58 E:0.037888 |  but also Ryan Giggs, who will step forward to win the Champions League for the second time in his career to add to those 10 premiership titles.
[11208.52 - 11211.52] P:1664.50 E:0.039038 |  They're right at the end of the queue and ahead of them is Sir Alex Ferguson.
[11211.52 - 11214.52] P:1696.81 E:0.041271 |  There's a huge big beam on Rio Ferdinand's face.
[11214.52 - 11216.52] P:1610.52 E:0.035064 |  Goodness me, you know.
[11216.52 - 11219.52] P:1604.12 E:0.036793 |  You know what, I think that both of these players have come of age.
[11219.52 - 11224.52] P:1712.32 E:0.035989 |  They'll shake each other by the hand and wish each other all the very best, and that's how it should be.
[11224.52 - 11228.52] P:1558.50 E:0.044184 |  The medal placed around Rio Ferdinand's neck, the medal placed around Ryan Giggs' neck.
[11228.52 - 11234.52] P:1658.41 E:0.040705 |  The big mosaic from the United Fans away to our left and red and white before the game spelt the word, believe.
[11234.52 - 11239.52] P:1685.01 E:0.040060 |  And now they really do, as Michel Platini presents the game.
[11239.52 - 11246.52] P:1771.63 E:0.035790 |  The Champions League trophy for 2008 to Manchester United, to Ryan Giggs and to Rio Ferdinand,
[11246.52 - 11252.52] P:1638.21 E:0.040755 |  United Champions of Europe for the third time and they have done it for the Vates.
[11252.52 - 11260.52] P:1549.97 E:0.041155 |  Mike Kingham, Alan Gray, Grant Taylor and Stan Collimore, your commentators on Five Life Sport in Moscow tonight.
[11260.52 - 11264.52] P:1461.01 E:0.045556 |  We're getting well into the morning. 6.06 will be with you in a few minutes time.
[11264.52 - 11268.52] P:1554.59 E:0.046246 |  Grant Taylor and Stan Collimore are with me.
[11268.52 - 11271.52] P:1502.39 E:0.040238 |  Sir Alex Ferguson has achieved so much.
[11271.52 - 11274.52] P:1567.06 E:0.043865 |  Is he going to go on now to achieve even greater things?
[11274.52 - 11278.52] P:1368.97 E:0.043118 |  Yes, it's as simple as that. He ain't going to stop now. When is he going to stop?
[11278.52 - 11281.52] P:1719.82 E:0.048222 |  It's interesting, the two trophies is won.
[11281.52 - 11284.52] P:1414.67 E:0.040681 |  The two trophies are going to be won by the two players.
[11284.52 - 11288.52] P:1691.89 E:0.040981 |  It's as simple as that. He ain't going to stop now. When is he going to stop?
[11288.52 - 11291.52] P:1734.60 E:0.040445 |  It's interesting, the two trophies is won.
[11291.52 - 11297.52] P:1594.56 E:0.040112 |  You know, you've been in Munich, what last kick of the game, swings it round from 0-1 down to 2-1.
[11297.52 - 11302.52] P:1636.21 E:0.037324 |  Here, you're going out via penalties, miss, you win it by penalties.
[11302.52 - 11306.52] P:1520.63 E:0.046560 |  I mean, not just the penalties also. I mean, attention is always in this game.
[11306.52 - 11311.52] P:1640.13 E:0.039286 |  You both well know. I mean, twice Chelsea hit the woodwork.
[11311.52 - 11315.52] P:1558.12 E:0.037018 |  It's up on the floor with that equaliser from Frank Lampard,
[11315.52 - 11319.52] P:1527.08 E:0.041938 |  after Manchester United had totally dominated, but it wasn't to be.
[11319.52 - 11322.52] P:1546.61 E:0.042098 |  Absolutely. First half, you'd have to say, was Manchester United.
[11322.52 - 11326.52] P:1491.86 E:0.039944 |  Seconds, Chelsea. Certainly the extra time, Peter, there.
[11326.52 - 11328.52] P:1588.89 E:0.046982 |  We're just looking at these players.
[11328.52 - 11332.52] P:1733.18 E:0.037198 |  Anders Saar has just lifted the trophy. He's kissed it twice.
[11332.52 - 11335.52] P:1668.55 E:0.041694 |  Saul Wayne, Rooney, pick it up. Patrice Evera just about now to pick it up.
[11335.52 - 11340.52] P:1460.29 E:0.040793 |  This is what players play football for. You want to get your hand on the big trophies,
[11340.52 - 11342.52] P:1333.96 E:0.041132 |  and they will have a wonderful evening tonight.
[11342.52 - 11348.52] P:1615.19 E:0.039168 |  Four goals. What a moment for him as well, Stan, a true professional.
[11348.52 - 11353.52] P:1650.45 E:0.042290 |  Well, like Roy Keane, 1999, I'm sure was etched on four goals his face.
[11353.52 - 11357.52] P:1612.13 E:0.039156 |  Would he ever get his hands on it again? It's been a long, old time, eight years.
[11357.52 - 11361.52] P:1618.07 E:0.037936 |  But the little fella, for me, one of the best English players of the generation,
[11361.52 - 11363.52] P:1585.83 E:0.028448 |  thoroughly deserved.
[11363.52 - 11368.52] P:1656.28 E:0.043706 |  Well, this Manchester United side are going to celebrate long into the night here in Moscow.
[11368.52 - 11373.52] P:1677.46 E:0.045312 |  Chelsea have, sadly, is always the case, made their way after going down to their fans
[11373.52 - 11378.52] P:1598.77 E:0.042020 |  and to applaud what's left of their fans here before making their way down the tunnel.
[11378.52 - 11381.52] P:1795.74 E:0.043412 |  Fergie is there now, a broad smile across his face.
[11381.52 - 11383.52] P:1837.85 E:0.040800 |  He'll be part of the action tonight.
[11383.52 - 11386.52] P:1751.49 E:0.041098 |  What's the action like outside on Trafford, Nick Garnett?
[11386.52 - 11390.52] P:1422.36 E:0.040100 |  Well, this is what happened when the final penalty was taken.
[11390.52 - 11392.52] P:1455.34 E:0.049076 |  What are you thinking about?
[11392.52 - 11395.52] P:1320.63 E:0.049746 |  That was too much.
[11395.52 - 11398.52] P:1210.98 E:0.049153 |  Oh, my God.
[11398.52 - 11400.52] P:1200.96 E:0.044715 |  Get down.
[11400.52 - 11402.52] P:1300.89 E:0.044964 |  What are you thinking?
[11402.52 - 11404.52] P:1269.26 E:0.049885 |  Oh, unbelievable, unbelievable.
[11404.52 - 11406.52] P:1286.55 E:0.051905 |  I'm finished.
[11406.52 - 11408.52] P:939.19 E:0.054394 |  I told Roy Geneberg, he'll miss the first penalty.
[11408.52 - 11410.52] P:1288.70 E:0.049041 |  Next thing, we're back.
[11410.52 - 11412.52] P:898.25 E:0.054996 |  Unbelievable.
[11412.52 - 11414.52] P:1135.83 E:0.048090 |  I just, I just, I just got down.
[11414.52 - 11416.52] P:1080.11 E:0.050529 |  Unbelievable.
[11416.52 - 11420.52] P:1104.73 E:0.046821 |  Well, here at the pub, around the corner from Old Trafford,
[11420.52 - 11423.52] P:1235.41 E:0.030586 |  with four of the fans, just how was that for you?
[11423.52 - 11426.52] P:1358.01 E:0.042958 |  That was, that was a brilliant result for football.
[11426.52 - 11427.52] P:1389.47 E:0.031073 |  In what way?
[11427.52 - 11432.52] P:1272.58 E:0.033079 |  In the way that Chelsea's attrition football didn't come through.
[11432.52 - 11434.52] P:1479.30 E:0.036503 |  They got beat in the end.
[11434.52 - 11437.52] P:1602.00 E:0.035758 |  What were the nerves like in here, those penalties?
[11437.52 - 11440.52] P:1588.19 E:0.039415 |  I have to say, I walked away and didn't watch them.
[11440.52 - 11442.52] P:1481.26 E:0.031180 |  What about you? Did you watch them?
[11442.52 - 11444.52] P:1383.24 E:0.044323 |  Garnett, I did!
[11444.52 - 11446.52] P:1529.01 E:0.030603 |  Woo!
[11446.52 - 11448.52] P:1959.65 E:0.048984 |  Did you watch them?
[11448.52 - 11451.52] P:1459.94 E:0.023748 |  I couldn't bear to watch, but at the end, you just had to give in
[11451.52 - 11454.52] P:1140.59 E:0.039504 |  and just run, pray yourself towards the cellar,
[11454.52 - 11457.52] P:1380.21 E:0.027422 |  but best not have my life, just don't tell her.
[11457.52 - 11460.52] P:1017.14 E:0.027896 |  They'll be well, fans are going to be celebrating
[11460.52 - 11462.52] P:1238.68 E:0.042156 |  right the way throughout the night.
[11462.52 - 11466.52] P:1594.48 E:0.028506 |  Now the Manchester United side now make it back out of the pitch,
[11466.52 - 11468.52] P:1839.94 E:0.048483 |  led by Wayne Rooney on this occasion,
[11468.52 - 11471.52] P:1682.27 E:0.044085 |  a long-standing Amandason who's, what quick feet he's got,
[11471.52 - 11473.52] P:1809.76 E:0.042310 |  and some of the back rooms,
[11473.52 - 11475.52] P:1750.88 E:0.039596 |  staff who worked so hard,
[11475.52 - 11477.52] P:1770.27 E:0.047762 |  Perky was praising them yesterday,
[11477.52 - 11480.52] P:1758.56 E:0.038532 |  but the last 10 days following the end of the season
[11480.52 - 11482.52] P:1708.69 E:0.042934 |  was vital for the back room staff.
[11482.52 - 11484.52] P:1723.20 E:0.041120 |  They did absolutely everything right.
[11484.52 - 11487.52] P:1723.13 E:0.039838 |  Avram Grant was the last of the Chelsea team to leave the field.
[11487.52 - 11490.52] P:1668.93 E:0.039746 |  In fact, I think he probably took a lot of the losers medals
[11490.52 - 11492.52] P:1655.89 E:0.037155 |  over to the Chelsea fans who are still here,
[11492.52 - 11495.52] P:1645.79 E:0.038186 |  and they seem to throw them into the crowd over there too.
[11495.52 - 11497.52] P:1593.80 E:0.043888 |  It'll be Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs
[11497.52 - 11499.52] P:1720.75 E:0.039914 |  who won't let go of this trophy.
[11499.52 - 11501.52] P:1702.08 E:0.036180 |  The photographs are about to be taken here.
[11501.52 - 11504.52] P:1722.41 E:0.040104 |  West London will be quieter right now, Leslie Ashmull.
[11504.52 - 11506.52] P:1548.56 E:0.030529 |  Oh, absolutely remarkable.
[11506.52 - 11509.52] P:1507.63 E:0.037790 |  They are just bereft and listened to what it's like now
[11509.52 - 11510.52] P:1662.31 E:0.035292 |  with the streets here.
[11510.52 - 11512.52] P:1665.83 E:0.028645 |  I mean, there's nobody here,
[11512.52 - 11514.52] P:1295.58 E:0.039243 |  and just think how busy it was earlier on.
[11514.52 - 11516.52] P:1459.29 E:0.040390 |  They just piled out of the pub, they all went home immediately.
[11516.52 - 11521.52] P:1610.88 E:0.033127 |  They are absolutely distraught, absolutely distraught.
[11523.52 - 11525.52] P:1845.79 E:0.048126 |  Leslie, thank you very much indeed.
[11525.52 - 11527.52] P:1875.99 E:0.043761 |  Ronaldo had said that he's staying at Manchester United
[11527.52 - 11529.52] P:1874.42 E:0.037707 |  next season stand.
[11529.52 - 11531.52] P:1759.96 E:0.046586 |  Well, there's no need for him to go anywhere else.
[11531.52 - 11533.52] P:1714.91 E:0.041763 |  There are people talking about world record beats,
[11533.52 - 11536.52] P:1700.29 E:0.036228 |  bits from the likes of Real Madrid and the like.
[11536.52 - 11538.52] P:1745.93 E:0.041456 |  Manchester United have a base.
[11538.52 - 11539.52] P:1627.36 E:0.046105 |  Hang on, hang on.
[11539.52 - 11541.52] P:1805.26 E:0.039354 |  I've got to say, this is bizarre.
[11541.52 - 11543.52] P:1892.55 E:0.038142 |  We've had the streamers, their goals,
[11543.52 - 11546.52] P:1738.84 E:0.038479 |  it's like massive bits of ticket, and it's absolutely...
[11546.52 - 11548.52] P:1593.06 E:0.041870 |  The players can't move.
[11548.52 - 11549.52] P:1916.16 E:0.047135 |  They can't move.
[11549.52 - 11551.52] P:1843.95 E:0.037446 |  The players can't move.
[11551.52 - 11553.52] P:1790.10 E:0.040621 |  They're a golden generation.
[11553.52 - 11556.52] P:1712.98 E:0.038180 |  There's absolutely no doubt about that, Grant.
[11556.52 - 11558.52] P:1769.44 E:0.039167 |  You look at that, you have to laugh at it.
[11558.52 - 11561.52] P:1870.06 E:0.038231 |  Yellow tape, yellow tape, and they're literally covered.
[11561.52 - 11564.52] P:1677.86 E:0.038889 |  When they all came down, the whole Manchester United squad
[11564.52 - 11566.52] P:1880.25 E:0.038441 |  was covered by them, and all you could see
[11566.52 - 11568.52] P:1793.13 E:0.040225 |  was this moving mass of tape.
[11568.52 - 11571.52] P:1744.98 E:0.041047 |  They've gone out of it now, and they're taking the cup
[11571.52 - 11573.52] P:1775.27 E:0.032137 |  to the Manchester United supporters.
[11573.52 - 11576.52] P:1782.15 E:0.047386 |  Leslie, Ronaldo and West Brown with Rio Ferdinand,
[11576.52 - 11578.52] P:1903.07 E:0.046222 |  Anderson really loving the moment.
[11578.52 - 11582.52] P:1935.96 E:0.042904 |  Wayne Rooney too, the whole of the United side are there.
[11582.52 - 11586.52] P:1862.35 E:0.036203 |  So, in life, there's sympathy, as there is in football
[11586.52 - 11588.52] P:1894.86 E:0.042351 |  sometimes too.
[11588.52 - 11590.52] P:1876.60 E:0.039521 |  50 years on from Munich then,
[11590.52 - 11593.52] P:1889.21 E:0.040220 |  Manchester United have won the championship of Europe.
[11593.52 - 11595.52] P:1956.38 E:0.037905 |  I remember on this year's 50th anniversary
[11595.52 - 11597.52] P:1781.90 E:0.040346 |  of that terrible disaster,

[11599.52 - 11601.52] P:1876.84 E:0.037225 |  spoke to me about the future.
[11601.52 - 11604.52] P:1838.55 E:0.037459 |  He didn't want to look back. He wanted closure.
[11604.52 - 11607.52] P:1982.35 E:0.034743 |  And I guess tonight, this current Manchester United side
[11607.52 - 11610.52] P:1831.01 E:0.035487 |  have given him and the other survivors
[11610.52 - 11613.52] P:1858.19 E:0.036973 |  and the surviving relatives just that.
[11613.52 - 11615.52] P:1907.39 E:0.041415 |  They can close a chapter.
[11615.52 - 11617.52] P:1847.00 E:0.034988 |  I hope we've forgotten, but Sir Alex Ferguson
[11617.52 - 11619.52] P:1731.11 E:0.039573 |  and this current Manchester United
[11619.52 - 11625.52] P:1810.79 E:0.036057 |  can now open a new chapter for this extraordinary football club.

[11629.52 - 11633.52] P:1853.66 E:0.035642 |  with five live and six oh sixes, Alan Green.
[11633.52 - 11636.52] P:1820.22 E:0.059766 |  An all English Champions League final,
[11636.52 - 11640.52] P:1445.13 E:0.049420 |  Manchester United, Chelsea in Red Square.
