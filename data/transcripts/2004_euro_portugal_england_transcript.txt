 Here we can see David Beckham at the mouth of the tunnel alongside Luis Figo, of course his teammates at Real Madrid, Ersmard, the referee at the front of the two teams and here they come for this quarter-final. Real Madrid unbelievably have supplied four captains during this tournament along with Raoul who's already gone home and Zidane of course the captain of France the England players They've all each got a mascot in yellow t-shirts and red shorts standing next to the England players link arms as we prepare For the national anthems at Portuguesa the Portuguese national anthem and of course God save the Queen as the PA asked all fans to respect both Oh Oh Oh Oh Every Portuguese supporter inside the Estadio da Luz who has a scarf held it up cop style during that rousing rendition of our Portuguesa As David Beckham leads his England team down the line of the Portuguese players they shake hands they shake hands with the officials The Lisbon youngsters take the huge flags away the crosses of George to the right the Portuguese flag to the left and We are almost ready For this quarter-final the England team just crouch for their photograph So let's join our commentary team them We're gonna hear from Graham Taylor throughout the match the England manager at Euro 92 from Terry Butcher England captain At Italian 90 during that semi-final from Mike Ingham and first His Alan Greek Well at last at last the England fans suspect the opposition national anthem about time to Well for me, this is where it starts Yeah, the group games are very important and let's face it most expected defeat by France and most expected wins against Switzerland and Croatia, but this is the game that sorts out Success from failure and these are the lineups England goalkeeper James Defenders Neville Terry Campbell and Cole midfielder Beckham Gerard lampart in schools Strikers on and really really the four goals so far in Euro 2004 Portugal's team has only one change Nuno Gomez into the suspended and totally ineffectual car letter their goalkeeper is Ricardo their defenders are Miguel Ricardo Caballo and Rade and Nuno Valente a midfield of Castigna Manish and then three ahead of them Figo Deco Ronaldo and the one-eyed striker Nuno Gomez the referee is a good one Ersmire from Switzerland England in their regular kit white shirts with the red flash Maybe shorts white socks Portugal in red shirts green shorts and red socks Ersmire just checked with both linesman The temperature is a little more than we'd have liked it in the mid 80s and humidity is up as well But there can be no excuses the pitch is perfect the arena is superb and the atmosphere is passionate England against Portugal for a place in the semi-finals of Euro 2004 We're underway England defending the goal to our left in the first half And not only for the first time in the tournament to the England that the England fans respect the opposition national anthem For the first time the right number I'm not not really surprised Terry No, it's not it's great great occasion great atmosphere. This is what it's all about. You saying it's right This is where the tournament starts it does separate the men from the boys here any ambitions They've got to get through it now here's that Rooney onto all on his offside the flag is quickly up Worrying black-armed bands this evening in memory of the England fan who was starved to death here in Lisbon It's a free kick to Portugal Ricardo with a gray goalkeeper in Jersey outside of his shorts They supposed to be a penalty expert Ricardo Heaven help us if he's employed later in the game Remember a silver goal or penalties and necessary will settle this quarter final tie If scores a level at the end of 90 minutes The ball is played down the right back and run into the defender and run a but it's headed away Here's Ronaldo and immediately Gary Neville gets in a good John Terry gets in a good aggressive challenge and the ball's out of play It's gonna be a throw-in to Portugal new to go new to Valenti one of five Champions League winners from Porter in this Portuguese side here's Ronaldo left for Deco perhaps Chelsea bound Deco To the left of the England penalty here and he gets the cross in low simple clearance by Terry to Gerard and Gerard hits it Towards the halfway line England quite deep there Terry are you expecting a fairly cautious approach over the first 15 minutes? Yeah, they haven't really settled down yet England and past the ball. It's been all Portugal I think just showing a few signs of nerves there trying to get the ball down and playing I think the Portuguese system is gonna frustrate England But already we saw early on Owen just offside from a pass from Rooney. He's playing on the last Defender is playing on the shoulder of the last defender. There is space behind that Portugal back for Interesting the costina is sticking pretty close to Wayne really at the moment Here's Sol Campbell for England to Gerard back to Campbell England with the one to 11 I there's any been the one change that was of course when lampard was injured For the first game. It's hit outfield now by David James And the international threat and after just two minutes he puts England in front It was a true striker finish wonderfully slip the smash past Ricardo England won Portugal now Well, well, well is this scripted? I can't believe it. It was actually flicked on into Michael Owens path by Castigna Trying to do a job on Rooney. He only flicked it past the two center defenders It was awkward for Michael Owen to take he had to do a 360 degree turn and flick it with the outside of his right foot which he did it flew past Ricardo Ricardo no chance And that's the goal we've all been waiting for has taken four games to get there Michael Owen Fantastic finish to one opportunity. He's had in the game. I think it may have been his first touch in the match. It's one nil England Well It was instinct. He didn't have time to think about it. I think that was a great thing about it Terry you know earlier chances that I might have fallen his way in this tournament He's had too much time to think about it. He has like a little confidence. That was pure instinct and The only data have my mind is that as my kingdom reminds me Paul schools scored early on in I'm hoping Against Portugal similar time. Yeah, well, do you look at Christ's score out against England as well and that only inspired England to come back Let's hope it doesn't inspire Portugal Deco looking for Nuno Gomez good header back by Gary Neville to David James And oh by the way has created a little bit of English history because he's become the first England international to score in four successive Championship finals whether it's a World Cup or a European Championship Jeff first. It's going in three Owen makes it forward. It's his 20 second goal for England Gerard looking for Owen again That's intercepted by Nuno Valente and how will Portugal respond? Ronaldo comes forward Gerard gets there Gerard aggressively in and fairly wins the ball puts you putting it out of play I'll bring in Grand Taylor in just a moment, but here's a throw in for Portugal taken by Ronaldo headed down by Figo on by Maniche and then Beckham's in there Beckham gives it away though who is club colleague a Figo Figo runs it out of play And it's a thing of throwing Graham Can you hear me Graham? I can just hear you say All I can say is that isn't that the fella that some people saying shouldn't have been dropped should not be in this It was always on a tremendous finish by him So skulls to score to no one scored and that really's only hit forward lap part two Here's Figo for Portugal stung by that early blow but Figo does well gets the cross into the penalty Ronaldo's there, Ronaldo's right foot shot hits an offender and James punches on the ball There was a good cross from Figo He managed to wriggle past Gary Neville got the cross to win all the way across the six yard line I think we went to Ronaldo his first shot was blocked by Ashley Cole the fell to me had to spin and hit it on the turn And there was Campbell There was to Cole as well to go and block the shot the ball going through the David James That's the second file by Deco and Gerard and this time our smile allowed it to go unchecked And that's hit forward by Gary Neville towards Wayne Rooney left of the Portuguese penalty area Our Cavalio goes with him Rooney is the ball Rooney checks on to his left foot Yes the cross ended they can flexion no it didn't it's behind for a goal kick I'll tell you what Gerard is very key. He's the one that's sitting on Deco He's the one that's gonna patrol in front of his back for whenever the wide applies by getting the ball into the lamp Part or is Gerard that's coming out to try and make it a 2v1 situation That Mike's reminding me of all the things I don't want to be reminded of He's just said of course Owen did score to put us in front against Brazil and the World Cup quarter Will you just sit there and just don't even concentrate you come on when you're in commentary Honest to goodness. She don't want to hear anything like that to you Terry No, you certainly don't have to be a help, you know Well, we're in the one and up against France and one and up against Brazil and lost those matches But you know it's sometimes a goal when you score a goal very early on yes I can tell you down but can inspire the opposition So even they've got to just settle down now make some passes look for the long ball through to Owen Who's on the back on the shoulder that asked to defend is now still don't write this defensive pair at all Owen and Rooney are running off them into space because the two fullbacks push on all the time St. Michael The ball is with skulls on the far side of the field doesn't he look sparky since he got the goal in the last game It's coming right for England now. What about David Beckham? Come on Beckham. We start well I think he started off well He's having to do a more defensive job at the moment is still frenetic is still frantic in them What happens is the the Portuguese fullbacks are pushing down? Miguel pushing down on the skulls on the other side Who never went is pushing down on to onto Beckham sometimes leaving space for Michael Owen in behind the fullback area Well, Castein is following and Rooney everywhere never with a throwing towards the goal scorer Michael on and Dranny Aggressively in but on holds them off. You see what a goal will do for you Owen Into lampard and back to Gary Neville. There's no width on the England left So it's staying on the right side Beckham into own Gerard's available and in room Gerard comes forward Try to squeeze it through to Rooney It was a block back to senior and then lampard gets in a tackle But it's run away by Miguel on the far side of the field England leading one No, the goal from Michael Owen after two and a half minutes and you're listening to five live on the BBC The ball given away by Miguel should have been cut out by Beckham taken up by Louis Figo nearly eight minutes played Figo cuts in field looks for no no Gomez the battle back from the new Gomez was bruer Manish should skipping just over the crossbar and I think James got a finger to it It's behind for a corner. Yeah, the ball just breaking to money So I think it was just outside the box and decided to hit it first time a swerving right footer just underneath the crossbar I think David James got the corner my thing So it's a corner to support to go corner taking short swing it towards the near post goes a long way Scalpel there social now though Ronaldo falls over going for a penalty not given by Ersmire. I told you's a good referee Balls at a play on the far side of the field and it will be a throw into England That's a problem the ball comes in on the corner, and I think it's Hit that thing was actually cold just seems to bounce off his knees in the box I think it was sold caramel that blocked the shot from Ronaldo, but It's plenty defending for me They just got to be more authoritative when it comes to set pieces and when it comes to defending just get rid of the ball Get it out be professional call with a throw in towards the halfway line Miguel Knucks it high into the air Gerard jumps heads it into the center circle, but here come Portugal again It's with no Valentino forward to Ronaldo down the near touch line the Portuguese left and he cuts in field Then he checks again clicks it wide to do the valente now to Maniche midway inside England's half The run by Deco Maniche should slow instead headed away by Terry and schools has the ball schools sort of the halfway line But there's quite a gap between midfield and attack at the moment for England schools ready for support They caught a possession a tackle takes it up tackle launches it to Figo into the penalty area right side Corner must contain an affliction Well Paul's goals took an eternity in the middle of the park didn't know where to play the ball across coming in from Maniche And it came off I think it came off Deco for a goal kick with the referees given a corner this time the left hand side second One to Portugal England didn't really protest very much nearly 10 minutes gone England need 1-0 the goal from Michael Owen Corner take it played in good punch by David James That's the way you want to see the goalkeeper fist the ball away to save deep It went 50 yards and I had a plate for a throw in figure came short There was still five in in the box the ball was our it in in Swinger right foot from the left hand side James came out Got a good fist to it the ball went out for a throw and that's what you want to see exactly right England just a little deep Terry It's worrying me is it because Portugal are pressing the back or England are playing deep well I've got a reaction from Portugal didn't we I mean about eight minutes ago England scored It has been a positive reaction from Portugal forced a couple of corners Oh Campbell put Cole into but above of there, but Cole did well finding his arsenal colleague once more and now forward to Michael Oh, and if Rooney's gonna be mark on will have room on over the halfway line and then oh I don't know what he was thinking there Michael But his first touch was poor and the ball is back with none of a lent it into Figo well done Frank lamp are taking the ball off figure and then I think he thought there three kickers gonna be awarded The ball squats away to on on in towards Rooney Rooney into the penalty block three kicking them come on David Beckham Our blocking Rooney then the ball luckily broke to Michael on on the right hand side He had one thought in his mind to play Rooney his strike partner dead center of goal Rooney's touch was to the to the left hand side Cavalaro came out and blocked him He's protesting that he wasn't foul or didn't foul when Rooney, but it's Beckham territory. It's right of center about 24 25 yards out Ricardo beware he's leaning against up one of the uprights trying to organize the Portuguese wall Ersmire will try to make sure that it's back fully ten yards loose Figo's just standing four or five yards away from Israel Madrid Colley And Beckham is saying the wall is not ten yards back and of course, it's not ten yards back Well, you can't be because you gave you by the cuts of the grass don't you the way the grass is cut at like six yards six meters Still not back ten ten yards Well, actually what happened there was the Beckham actually moved the ball back to give himself a little bit more room and new Novalendi at the nerve to complain so it's a long time before this free kick is taken nearly 12 minutes gone England The goal up through Michael own it's Beckham territory that the wall is nowhere near ten yards away I don't even take yards clear Beckham's gonna take the free kick anyway right footed sorting in takes an affection Rune's there really shot blocked by the goalkeeper Ricardo and behind for a corner Yeah, ball played Wayne really the boat up in there. You're right. The wall was never ten yards away No, he fight it in it in close to game Beckham shot was blocked in the felt a Rooney, but it was really wide on the right hand side Ricardo came out Well to block it right on the goal line corner England. I mean, there's no excuse for the referee not knowing that wasn't ten yards Beckham to take the corner from the right hand side five white shirts to aim at inside the penalty It's played in deep lamp or is there so to his combo ball breaks to Michael on left edge of the penalty here He's tackling beaten by Ronaldo Ronaldo back to Castigna and Castigna waves it upfield But straight out of play and it's a throw into England on the far side of the field You think the referee looks a bit like Richard Branson? No, no, I think he does all right Trust you. I think your referees like Richard Branson as well at times Now listen just lay off them, you know We don't want to antagonize them even from this distance skulls in the far side well played skulls into lampard lampard then Rather loose with possession and it's cleared away to none of Gomez back to Deco and Deco Hit the ball to the left hand side brilliantly brought done by the right five Manish Who's inside the center circle line stepping away from Rooney Manish forward to Deco? Deco's getting a lot of room Deco now has Ronaldo ahead of him plays it behind the United York sir And it's I just play for a throw it I think there's good coverage on the England midfield They're forming a good screen in front of their back for the back for really up for it tonight Anything I would say is very difficult to build it from the back and when England do get their wide midfield players and skulls and Beckham on the ball They've got to keep it better because that's the space on the plant Well, no country has ever lost the Sorry, only one country's lost the first game the European Championship and come back to win it That was Holland in 1988. Well, both these countries lost their opening game Obviously both of them have a clear chance in Euro 2004 England leading by one goal to nil Ronaldo was dying Filed by Ashley Cole according to the linesman who's only a couple of yards away nice set pieces Terry set pieces Yeah, it's a free kickers never a free kick as well. He really died for that did Ronaldo But it's convinced the lines and it's convinced the referee. This is where England. This is there Achilles heel They've got to defend this well It's a couple of yards in from the right corner fly Deco takes it it's rolled in I comes James absolutely nowhere and it's headed behind by John Terry for another corner Well, don't mind that it's virtually the same sort of free kick or corner situation The the free kick was about a yard inside his two balls on the pitch at the moment But now it's a corner well played John Terry gets his head to the ball be positive clear your lines and then deal with it after that Deco from the right once more and he swirls it behind the goal. Thank you very much Deco. That's great stuff We'll take that. Yeah, I don't mind that at least yeah I mean I would imagine Scolari down the sideline on the touch line is gone bananas because It's all about England not particularly strong on set piece defending The last thing you want is a corner taker to put the ball behind for a goal kick But it gives a chance for England to settle down a little bit get their shape get a bit of a breather And then so I'm worked the way up the pitch Quarter of an hour gone only five more quarters of an hour to go Seems a long time Beckham trying to find really down the right side and hits that I had a play It's gonna be a throw in to Portugal and you know Valente the left back to take it Figo shows Figo and Ronaldo switch flanks at the moment Figo's down the left and Figo has the ball new to Valente in support Figo cutting in towards Gary Never guess the cross end, but thank you very much That's straight into the under David James There's still only one in the box isn't there when Figo crossed the ball Beckham and Gary now will did a good job like we were Before pushed the wide player wide so his cross came in and there's only one Portuguese player in a box and David James made an easy Cat cherry this is the third time I've seen Portugal in Euro 2004 They don't get players into the box team in the end had lots of chances against Spain But only because Spain were frantically searching for an equalizer So let's see how they do when they're a goal down well played Ashley Cole Tackling Ronaldo on the far side of the field. They've got to be tight on Ronaldo make him feel uncomfortable Physically uncomfortable Maniche for the next one crossfield pass to the left side and Nunavallente Nunavallente just over the halfway line Into Castigna Castigna now to Maniche once more Maniche Prefer to petite in this Portuguese 11 much more attack minded and they may need him now Good pass to the left once more to Nunavallente Nunavallente moving forward Then he leaves it for Luis Figo faced by David Beckham Beckham gets a boot there as the cross was played and the lampard plays It away to Beckham once more back to lampard old careless from Frank lampard England Concealing possession on occasion as usual too easily Nunavallente with a cross very deep Ronaldo brings it down right edge of the penalty area call is watching it's played back Miguel with a shot But that was not only over the crossbar. It was also worldwide and it's another goal kick to England There were still only two players in the box It was a lovely glorious pass from Figo the left wing right across to Ronaldo on the right hand side Ashley Cole closed him down well again. I think Ashley Cole's been told Threaten Ronaldo's first touch very long crossfield passes threatened the first touch She don't allow him to get a run at you But he laid it back to Miguel who plays over the bar from like 25 yards at a slight angle So, you know, I would think it's good defending from England so far Michael on his score He's that 20 sixth goal in an England shirt tonight That's why England lead 1-0 and Michael on has moved into the top 10 of England goal scorers On after the ball and keeping it in play and he does very well Get it back. He's there inside the penalty. We go reacts brilliantly back. I'm as there back I'm careful inner forward cross in from Beckham takes an affection lifts over the cost bar corner and that all came from Michael on He's having an absolute blind Michael on so far. He's chasing balls There's lots of space behind this Portuguese defense. We said that before and it's happening now corner team quickly back To Owen just to the right of the penalty here back to Beckham and Beckham crosses right footed good header away There are appeals by the Portuguese defenders that there was a foul by Rooney not given another good ball by Beckham finding Jarrod on the Skull and towards all on the outside over the crossbar just over the crossbar Well, the Spice is there again It was a ball from Beckham to the on the right hand side going back towards his own goal played the ball to Jarrod Jarrod played the first time to Skulls who lifted over the top of the Portuguese defense Michael on was in and if Michael on could have squared it when really had a tap in but Michael on was pressed That he fender came across pretty quickly could only lift it just over the crossbar But you know something cherry I think that's a good sign because I think the Michael on of the last month or so might have been looking to lay it off Reluctant to take the responsibility himself now He feels that he can take that responsibility He is scored tonight after two and a half minutes and here in the Estadio deluz England lead Portugal the host by a Goldenell and they're playing well now Beckham back to never Neville drives it forward own chases after it Ricardo out to the edge of his penalty area and Ricardo has the ball in both hands and we played 19 frantic minutes Has been frantic. It's been good from England's point of view. They've set the stall out very well Oh, what was Gary Neville thinking off? I think he slipped there just trying to head it forward But slipped in the right back area has conceded a corner which figure will take and once more I don't like this tactic everything on player back defending it's played short though to Deco Deco dinks the cross towards the far post costiniers there But he can't guide the header back into the danger area which behind for a goal Yeah, he's just a bit uncertain about that and just a little bit worried that saying then haven't picked the players up as Enough in the bodies back there to pick up the Portuguese who don't generally put a lot of men into the box But but Christina came around the back Deco tried to think the ball from left to right with a little diagonal The focus to you, but he couldn't got his head back across the box But that's four corners that England have conceded that's been a bit sloppy on that occasion But they're defending I would say has been better on set pieces But you know if they're gonna consider a lot then you know time might time may tell and they still need one nil Oh and heads the ball out to the right side Graham tether coming on in a moment to give us his thoughts Rooney Crosses and it hits none of the land he's left foot and that's behind for an England corner There's a good pace to the game as well and England you know they won the lap Haven't got to go and chase it what you don't want to see is England drop deep but they did against France and against other teams as well When they have been one they're up they've got to keep and pass the ball very well We're talking they're doing and they're finding out in superlative form tonight And they'll look they've also got the threat of Rooney who's been close once or twice as well David Beckham to take the corner from the right-hand side we played 20 and a half minutes You're listening to five line on the BBC sport on five taken short to Gary Neville edge of the penalty Neville dinks in across Campbell's there Yeah, but a bit of improvisation from England's point of view the left one-on-one at the back of English deco against Ashley Cole Very brave from England's point of view Gary Neville came late Beckham laid it into him took a touch Gary Neville Dinked it into the box and there was Campbell coming in about eight yards out a free header virtually under pressure a little bit from a Portuguese defender, but he put his header over the ball. That was a good chance Graham. Yeah, well, this is an end-to-end game It's been like that for the first 20 minutes Neither team has settled and dominated the roles of Gerard and Costini are very interesting Because they're looking for the players in the home But I have to say since his mistake Costini has looked very unsettled Rooney's after the ball Right side of the Portuguese penalty here, and then he played off on Friday and what's the complaint here a foul by Rooney? Not sure about that at all Graham Anyway, I don't know what Where does it say in the rulebook that you get penalized for losing your foot? Is that it? Oh that I mean that's clearly breaking the law And we left it is boot and clattered it into the face of Andrade while I would understand what boots what what boots does When Rooney, well, I think it's Nike boots Perhaps my has got to deal with Nike Okay, I'm well after say that no, but you did it as usual Ronaldo to Miguel skull slips Miguel up to the edge of the penalty are cuts inside and that wasn't that clever Is he ran straight into Ashley Cole who clears it to Michael on on the far side Owen back to Cole and Cole's clearance that not an effective one collected by Deco Deco to the right and Miguel first time cross by Miguel Terry jump didn't connect with his head and it's lifted away to safety by Gary Neville over the halfway line We've played 22 and a half minutes Michael Rooney struggling Wayne Rooney struggling always sitting down now Michael Well, I hope it's just that he can't get his boot back on again But anyway, we'll just watch what happens at the moment Rooney sitting down and Gary Lewin is waiting to come on so Wayne Rooney's got a problem England have the ball and they need to give get that David Beckham santa lampard get the ball out of play so that Rooney can receive attention well After all the headlines Let's hope this isn't an injury headline now around Wayne Rooney He's back up on his feet again and the referee is my is saying that he's gonna have to leave the pitch to receive attention It's his right leg and he's hobbling off Terry What do you think I don't know if that came when the challenge when he lost his boot in the Portuguese penalty area whether he was stood on The Portuguese defender stood on his foot. I mean, I mean, he's obviously accidental when his boot came off But he's just receiving treatment there. I wonder if it's a Saunas to his foot that he just needs a little bit of treatment Right spending your now it's showing a bit of a concern and he's just gone forward and spoken to Rooney and the physio England at the moment down to 10 men England leading by one goal to know you're listening to five live Michael Owen getting it inside the first three minutes He told us in an interview yesterday that he thought he was getting better in the tournament and inevitably he scored his first goal but now there's Concern about Wayne Rooney. He's off the pitch Ronaldo's got the ball can Portugal take advantage here Ronaldo turning around Ashley Cole edge of the area gives the ball back to Figo Ronaldo's gone down following the challenge Figo lays it forward looking for Deco Deco's gonna try and pull this one back pulls it back headed away well by John Terry Rooney's gonna come back into the game and you'll get a great ovation from the England fans as soon as they see it back on The pitch in the meantime lampard loses the ball over on the far side takes an effliction James has dropped it and then gets it second time round It's a very open game too open really from England's point of view They're trying to attract the referee's attention now so that Rooney Can come back into this quarterfinal here comes Wayne Rooney England with 11 men back on the field He's not running well though Wayne Rooney and he's gonna have to Maybe leave this game here come Portugal Luis Figo edge of the penalty area tackled by Skoles Figo gets it back again Drama surrounding Wayne Rooney Rooney at the moment watching the ball in the air headed wide By Portugal doesn't look good about Rooney here Terry doesn't look good at all No, no Gomez heading the ball wide there bit of a half chance for Portugal good cross But in the Valencia on the left hand side really struggling he's struggling he's limping Just about on the on the halfway line towards the center circle I think he's similar to the Benish to say well hang on a minute This is not this is not right and the Spenny or Harrison talking to Gary Loon talking to the physios Ray Clemens is out there as well I think they're just gonna give him five minutes to see what he can do if it's right or not So much of his game of course is about blistering pace, but at the moment he's virtually a passenger and of course Thinking ahead if England can get to the semi-final That's in six days time, but they will not want to take any risk now with the player of their tournament so far Wayne Rooney We may have to have Heskey or Vasello on soon for Rooney Who's just been given two or three minutes to see whether he can run off the injury? Daria Darius Vasello will be the replacement we think in just a moment for Wayne Rooney for goals in the last two games Portugal have detailed a player to look after Wayne Rooney, but it looks like this quarter final is only gonna last 26 minutes Rooney will be replaced by Darius Vasello of Aston Villa But not yet the fourth officials not and I don't kind of understand why the change couldn't have been made then How much of a disruption is this going to be for England Terry? He can't get them on yet because the fourth official is telling the tucky shirt in are you sure he's having a laugh that fourth official Rooney can't even challenge for that long ball and Portugal now in central midfield whistles gone for handball and Now just tell us how much you think this is going to affect England Rooney coming off to be replaced by Vasello Well, Michael Owen just going over to get a drink as well might get some instructions from Steve McClann I think it is it's obviously a blow from England's point of view But Vasello is a good sub to have to come on now He normally comes on for 20 minutes or about 15 minutes towards the end of the match He's obviously a striker. He's done well in the championship so far. He's done well for England and he's in the career but he's you know, it's it's it's a It's a challenge for him as a challenge from Michael Owen up front to forge a new partnership It's not what England wanted but they won them up and Vasello is a good man to come on Symbolically, of course, it's a big loss because everything has been revolving around Rooney England have had so much confidence As a result of his form the cell tries to make a challenge on Cavalio Cavalio clears Nuno Gomez all in his own soul Campbell hits it back to David James. What do you think he's done Wayne Rooney? What do you think the injury is? I think what his boot came off? I'm not too sure if the defender andrade stood on his foot. He may have just done that But look there's oh when the when the boot came off Obviously the referee pulled him back but then he couldn't carry on after that So you may have had a maybe my been stood on England must get on with it They must concentrate as Deco the Portuguese danger man looks to filter the ball through to Ronaldo Ashley goal doesn't clear But then it comes back luckily to David James in the England goal away to our left You're listening to five live England getting off to a fly here through Michael Owen scoring inside the first three minutes It's 26 international goal. He's now level with Brian Robson 26 goals for England next in line with 27 is David Platt England give the ball away a little easily. It's Figo now for Portugal side stepping Gary Neville He's got Valente down this near side the field Figo going forward lays it into Ronaldo Ronaldo shot and it's blocked by soul Campbell Oh in his back inside his own half and of course a feature of England's play with Rooney as Ronaldo goes forward now And he's brought down on the edge of the area Precisely the sort of thing that England have got to avoid in these games against sides like Portugal with their set pieces Of course a feature of Rooney's play is he's been dropping deep and helping out the midfield players as well And now Michael Owen is going to have to do that. I'd say what a dive that was what an absolute dive That was on the edge of the box is a con man and I'll do a net case It is con the referee is given the free kick danger for England here real danger Louis Figo who got Portugal back into the game against England four years ago He's announced his retirement of course from international football in Portugal don't win tonight. This will be his last game Here he is in Lisbon edge of the penalty area David James is ready England have conceded a free kick Louis Figo over the bar And the goal kick for England I'll have it with that because the wall stood strong a stood tall Figo came up to it and shaped Perhaps on the wrong side if anything for Figo But the referee's got to be stronger when it comes to an elder because he pushed the ball past Ashley Cole and then just Clattered into him. He knew he wasn't gonna get the ball the other side the referee gave the free kick There's a slight reversal in the roles now for cell is the one that's pushed further forward I think Michael Owen is doing that really role and just coming off Ball headed on by the cell looking for Michael Owen Took it early and Ricardo Makes the save and produces a corner fantastic right footer there from Michael Owen with real sting and Ricardo can seize a corner kick It was a good save as well Ricardo the left-hand side that was going just inside the post the cell flicked it on Owen was the one that went for the other side good save from Ricardo David Beckham replaces a couple of divots Down by the corner flag near side the field the England right to corner kick to England There's a short corner to lampard lampard lifts it into the far post with too much pace Terry might get that over on the far side by the corner flag But all he's done is set it up for the fullback Miguel Skulls now picks up the loose ball for England far side the left turn back well by Campbell to Ashley Cole Who's been having an outstanding tournament Skulls gets the ball away and now tries to recover it and then fouls The Portuguese player Figo in the process England leading by one goal to nil free kick to Portugal here comes a danger man now from Portugal Deco Cross comes Gary Neville and Steven Gerrard who's playing very deep players long for England looking for the pace of derisive cell The cell lets it bounce a couple of times and then try they I thought climbed all over him at the free kick has been given mystifyingly to Portugal in the left back position I'm a little I mean like Soldiers stood there and grand is all over him the referee gives the free kick against myself just for standing there don't have political In just ten days Wayne Rooney has become an icon here with England But England are gonna have to win this quarterfinal now without him We played half an hour of the game still an hour to go here in Lisbon where Portugal haven't lost a game for 17 years Portugal have the ball far side the field laid forward Paul Markey by England No no Gomez unmarked on the edge of the area now Ronaldo, but it's taken away from him at the last minute by David Beckham Beckham all he can do is knock it straight back to Portugal and England are being stretched at times and Rade the defender Onto costiña who's now not having to mark Wayne Rooney anymore Figo in the center circle Portugal building slowly from the back and again Deco has too much room in midfield the ball breaks to Nuno Gomez Back again to Figo Figo lifts the ball forward headed sideways by Deco and cleared by Seoul Campbell England leading 1-0 The sellers come on for Rooney England at the moment had just lost it a little bit in midfield They haven't got a great control on the game at the moment But Michael Owen a fantastic effort just two or three minutes ago Portugal building again left-hand side David Beckham's there in the right back position Beckham down the line trying to play it into Vercel and Rade's there and Andrade clears now Nuno Valente the left back costiña all porto there because now Deco's got it and the crowd emerging in forward Deco the danger man the Brazilian born player shoots wide and here After 32 minutes is Graham Taylor What an open game this is although in the last few minutes Portugal have certainly had much more possession and are looking dangerous But what I think what I'd like to say in the opening half hour I don't think you could have asked for a better performance from a frontman than Michael Owen Not only has he scored the goals, but he's come short. He's looked wide behind the full backs He's worked hard when out of possession He really has had an absolutely first-class opening half hour to this game Thank you Graham that Michael Owens had to change his role now in this game it to a certain extent He's not able to play off the last defender anymore Vercel's got that job with his pace Owen's having to tuck in behind him having Lost Rooney in this game after 26 minutes, but England have the lead by one goal to nil They were always likely to score in this game the question mark was of course could they control midfield? Could they get it right at the back? Owen very deep for him on to Gerard Gerard gets it away look Didn't really look to see where the cell was goals comes in with a sliding challenge And Owen again is tucking in in midfield to help out Gary Neville slides it to Ashley Cole down the England left and England now need a little bit of possession on the ball Played forward long by Lampard Cavalos there up against a rise for cell the cell may get this It's bouncing awkwardly for him the Aston Villa man is there still derives for cell and the end Portugal get a clearance Miguel up against Skulls goals tigerishly comes in but can't get the ball Portugal now setting up a counter attack for them until Deco gives it away Lampard's there and now it's Steven Gerard and Gerard turns and Gerard approaches the half wayline Michael Owen to his right The cell to the left. It's a great ball to the fullback Gary Neville now David Beckett chips it forward looking for Gary Neville Gary Neville should get this by the corner flag What's the cross line and it goes flicked header from Michael Owen and it's taken a deflection off the defender and England responding well here They have a corner over on the far side the left Michael Owen's like a magnet for the ball Whatever the whenever the ball comes into the box or whatever the balls play forward It goes straight to Michael Owen and Grains exactly right He's leading this line by example by work right by touch by vision He's having a fantastic match and even then Gary Neville going down the right hand side crossed the ball to the near post Who is making the run? It was Michael Owen good glancing header I think it hit Cavalaro went over the ball went over the bar Brignan's fifth corner the England are to advance in this tournament. They must hope that Rooney has bruising only Nothing broken with the foot here comes an in swinging corner from David Beckham and that's headed away and over Comfortably wide by Derias Vassal and it's going to be a goal kick for Ricardo This is five live in England ten minutes away from halftime lead one nil. It's amazing that Vassal actually wins the header It does come off the defender Comes off Cavalaro I think or Valenti for the for a corner the referee doesn't give it It's amazing that for selling Owen I wouldn't head us in the box when they've got big center halves What's a name he could make for himself tonight derisive cell having come on earlier than he would have anticipated for Wayne Rooney He was always likely to play a part in the second half Now soul Campbell to John Terry and Terry just smashes the ball rather aimlessly back into the Portugal half England need better build up than that from The back it's andrade the former Porto player now with de Portivo la Carunier in Spain Costinia the man of course who scored a villa park against England and also scored late on to deny Manchester United in the Champions League Skulls and he's lost out and it's Deco now for Portugal winning a corner kick. It's end-to-end Portugal have a corner far side the right Figo to take it and Cavalio and andrade the two centre backs both go forward and these are more testing moments for David James and his defenders Corner kick to Portugal far side the right and it goes and it's headed away and wide Even wider than the cells effort that was costinia and that's a goal kick to David James Yeah, but boss is worrying for Portugal that myself wins headers from corners is also worrying that Christina Will wings headers from corners as well and because Terry and lampard that were going towards the ball And Christine had the free head up from about ten yards But they're never gonna get it on target for England go have to defend better It says one of those ones are you not waiting for Portugal to score you're gonna try and get the ball and keep it But it's difficult to build it up from the back because both England's full backs are plugged now here come Portugal once more through Deco Deco tackle from behind Stephen Gerard gets a yellow card referee Ersmire shows a yellow card to perhaps England's most important player Stephen Gerard that's his first of the tournament but Gerard now is on a yellow card in this game and Portugal have a free kick at least 30 yards away from David James's goal we have played 37 minutes of The very entertaining perhaps to entertaining first half from Sven You're an Ericsson's point of view England in front in the first three minutes They have lost Wayne Rooney through an injury the cell has come on Deco man of the match against Spain man of the match in the Champions League final for Porto He's got Maniche to the right and Deco now hands-on hips Prepares to lash this one towards David James guard. It's dreadful. It's into the crowd for a goal kick Yeah, it was Figo that took the van Nisteloi roll just in front of David James About four or five yards offside but came back on but the free kick was never gonna trouble David James miles over the bar. Thankfully Well now Gerard of course has to be careful on a yellow card in this game and England give it away again Too simply Deco's on the ball looks for Miguel down the right-hand side It's out of playing them as trying get to half time here with this one-nil lead Both of these countries of course coached by an overseas coach No team has ever won a European Championship with an overseas coach Scolaria of Portugal Ericsson of England and Ericsson's England Are just in front here through Michael Owens goal inside the first three minutes Portugal have had good possession as Maniche finds Figo With two or three England players around him finds Miguel down the right-hand side and that's a poor delivery from him and England will hope for more of the same Never goal kick for David James away to our left. We've got About seven minutes left of the first half I'm not that concerned when the ball goes out to the wide players because the full backs are doing an excellent job And midfield players are coming back to screen defenders are picking up well in the box So I think from that point of view even to doing very well and remember Scolari was a manager for Brazil Brazil were one-nil down in the one-nil up courtesy of a Michael Owen goal in the quarter finals of the World Cup And a bit of magic from the Brazilians got themselves back into the game at this moment in time I'm doing a good job defensively and not keeping the ball as well as Ericsson would like I think Brazil got back into the game crucially just before half time. Here's Michael Owen by the corner flag near side of the field winning a throw in against a Calvary, oh, it's the throw to England and they're taking their time Gary Neville showing his experience Paul Scoles the Salon. Oh, you know the three England players in the area Gerard and Lampard lurking Gary Neville looks like he's gonna try and Find some distance with this throwing David Beckham at the moment by the near post one-nil to England in goes a throw in towards Beckham And it's well caught by Ricardo and he clears quickly and Terry is there before Nuno Gomez can threaten Gerard heads the ball back to Campbell and Campbell Campbell looks at the back past James there and that's a reasonable clearance by James It goes a long way in the air when it comes down both players miss it the cell now up against and Rade and Ball played forward looking for Lampard across comes Kavayo who's quick at the back the Porto man and Kavayo clears Figo can't take it and Terry will knock it sideways to Gary Neville who again shows his experience Finding James James to Scoles beautiful layoff from Scoles to Ashley Cole Michael Owen trying to stay on site Cole up against Costinia but he's lost the ball to Miguel and now he's out of position as Portugal come on the counterattack Here's the danger man Cristiano Ronaldo as Cole tries to get back Deco to Ronaldo challenge comes in from Campbell It was super and Gerard now may get caught in possession Beckham and Gerard game opening up once more Gerard goes past Kavayo He's got the cell to the right and now into the left still Gerard to Beckham down the right Oh in scoring for it. Oh, but Beckham doesn't get the cross in Peel the handball against her and Rade and again the game opens up now as Portugal take the ball inside the England half And it's with Deco the little midfield man Deco against Frank Lampard The referee has given the free kick against Lampard And this one is even nearer now the England goal 25 yards out Free kick to Portugal in the last five minutes of this first half This is more Figo Terrage on the left-hand side this referees having a nightmare Lampard They never so well Deco pushed the ball Lampard got his body in the way the referee deemed it to be a foul Diabolical decision once again, and you feel sometimes as well when it comes to that quarterfinal in Chisauka There's a bit of Brazilian magic this time it may be something from the referee England need to get a half time in the lead It's going to be Lewis Figo with the free kick. It's a big high one and James gets his hand to it as Miguel came racing in and it'll be a corner down the far side the right-hand side Well, I suppose for the neutral it's all action this quarterfinal But England will need to try and close the game down. They may need people like Hargreaves in the second half They've been forced into one substitution already Bringing on the cell for the injured Rooney corner kick to Portugal well dealt with by Gary Neville Portugal coming back once more with Maniche Maniche now center of the field the cells there good tackle from the cell England need to clear they haven't cleared it back to Maniche Maniche shot chance here Straight at David James Surely a hand ball as well by Portuguese player Earth's Maya has he given the free kick yes, yes, he has One thing he's got last he gets a free get to England the ball came in from a niche It was presented to me nice back into the the center of midfield about 25 26 yards out of the shot here Ronaldo If anything else Ronaldo's a lot of shippers a hamble or not I definitely made contact with his arm ball then squirting through to David James free kick for England No threat of Rooney anymore the cells trying to take over the mantle Filled so effectively by Wayne Rooney in this tournament and England must hope if they get through that the news isn't serious About the young Everton player and now Lampard steps in as Figo is a bit sluggish Then he's brought down by Costinia now that has to be surely if the referee is going to be consistent a yellow card It was virtually the same kind of offense as Steven Gerrard's a few moments ago But there's no yellow card for Costinia and can you tell me why there's a shock now? I can't see real if anything you'd say that Deco is bearing down more towards England golems further forward And he deemed it to be a far worthy of a yellow card But there are the Portuguese players around Lampard, but that was a crunching tackle from Costinia Two minutes plus added time left in his first half as Beckham's waste the free kick He looked for skulls over on the far side. It was very obvious one and England have a throw in and Ashley Cole is sticking to his guns over on the left-hand side doing quite well against Whenever it's Figo or Ronaldo, they're into changing all the time. He's done very well. That's the call. He's having a great game So the all the England back for and the middle field in fact everyone is having a good game so far as a great great team performance England taking their time then the ball is delivered But not accurately enough to the cell the cell now the referee's whistle is going to go again The cells been penalized and Portugal what they cannot take the free kick from there the referee now makes them go Some 15 yards sideways the kick is taken and now it's Maneesh approaching the halfway line Maneesh onto Nuno Gomez fouled by John Terry and They have to be more careful than that doing them. They mustn't just present the Portuguese with these kicks We've got about a minute and 15 seconds plus time to be added on as the balls laid into the England area Terry's here It's a bit far from Terry Ronaldo on the edge of the area another free kick Gary Neville has been shown a yellow card now by Ersmire So Gary Neville and Stephen Gerrard are on yellow cards for the rest of this tournament And here's a free kick right on the edge of the area with 55 seconds left of this first half plus time to be added on and this is Portugal's opportunity To get back in the game right on half time and to change the atmosphere in this stadium Figo over the ball Deco is not very far away Ersmire Marches the 10 yards takes the England wall back And Luis Figo and Deco two of the great set-piece players in the world Prepare to get Portugal back into this quarterfinal. This is dangerous for England They conceded yet another free kick on the edge of the area and Figo hits it high wide And not handsome at all That's gone wide and Englander let off though Terry Yeah, once again Ronaldo is just touched and goes down very easy on the edge of the box They've had Portugal about two or three really good free kicks in good positions And I'll take you back to February when it was Paul Leto that scored my free kick in a very similar position against England to equalize Ledley King's opener that you know Palato. He was at a wretched tournament He may have been the man that could have got Portugal back into the match. It's a great suspended It's a great scoreline that it's not been a perfect half for England losing the injured Rooney I'm picking up yellow cards for Gary Neville and Stephen Gerrard ball played forward to hastily there by Lampard and Dreades there I haven't seen the fourth official But we surely are now playing time added on as Gary Neville looks for the cell the cells want a free kick Will there be time to take it? Have you seen the fourth official? Well, I've seen him he's just patrolling like a schoolmaster on the sidelines there He's bothered a bit of board up Free kick taken by England headed away by Calvier. We've just got news about Wayne Rooney kicked on the foot apparently and we must hope there's no Bones broken and that it's just simply bruising that can be dealt with With ice treatment and all sorts of stuff like that. Anyway, Rooney's off the game out of the game We're playing time added on here in Lisbon England leading through Michael Owens goal And this might be Portugal's last chance to equalize before halftime Ronaldo now down the right-hand side Figo down the left Ersmire the referee sends the players to the dressing room for halftime And of course this was the way that it was in England's opening game England led France one day at halftime through Frank Lampard's goal Tonight they struck after only three minutes through Michael Owen They lost Wayne Rooney halfway through the first half having been kicked on the foot. They have picked up yellow cards to two of their Very important players Stephen Gerrard and Gary Neville But at least England have the lead and apparently the the last word on Rooney at the moment is no word at all the football association Don't know as yet how bad the Rooney injury is so the halftime score line here England one Portugal no Graham Taylor England manager Euro 92 It's an astonishingly open game. Does that suit England or not only if they score I would say it has been so open and one has to say that Portugal have had more of that possession As the game has progressed, but you've always got the feeling that England can get a second goal It says Terry Butcher said earlier that in fact the two Portuguese full-backs do push on and there is that space in behind them As I said earlier, I think Michael Owen has had an absolutely terrific game a little bit disturb us about John Terry I've seen John Terry have have a better game than he's had at the moment and the quick interpassing of the Portuguese players Can put a cause problems one nil up have a look at the halftime Just get a breather get yourself together again and then come out But if we're gonna see the second half like the first half mark We're really gonna be on the edge of our seats. How have England changed as an attacking force Because of Rooney going off and the cell coming on if they have at all Well, I don't think they've changed too much. We say that you know Michaels Owen has coming back into the hole He was actually I'd picked up early that in Rooney were sharing that role That's what I felt early on but I think now with the cell coming on then the cell is a front man I mean, I'm as I say having worked with the dress He can come off but not in the way that Rooney does Vaselle is on the edge of people very powerful very strong and he now has a great opportunity to make his mark and then Owen will Take that responsibility. I've seen him talking to Vaselle and he'll take the responsibility I honestly I can't speak too highly about Michael Owen's performance in this first half I think it's been absolutely first class. How have England in your opinion dealt with Figo and particularly Ronaldo Well, Ronaldo is difficult to to deal with because one has to say that he does get fouled But also he does fall to the ground very easily and so one has to watch that in the main They've handled it reasonably well I'm just a bit concerned about the openness of the game and the room that sometimes Deco gets to be able to provide the passing and finally just before we go to the news is it valid to have a conversation about the referee or not I mean in other words, it's you know, it will leave in itself out He's given a few stinking decisions in the first half He wants to walk out the free kicks and he's done it three times I've count his walk eight paces and then allowed the ball to stand up He's never moved them the nine meters as they say back. He's never moved them that back at all It's a it's a strange performance But having said that I have to say that the referee's performance generally in this tournament have been very very good He's not very good as you say it marking out and he's a grocer. I wouldn't want to buy two pounds of apples often If you can't even mark out ten yards Thank you very much graham Taylor more from graham in a couple of moments time half time then here in lisbon It's portugal nail england one will have a full run up from wimbledon including a shock exit for venus williams after the news with dahlia rafael Live news live sport This is bbc radio five live Thanks mark a national rail strike planned for next week has been called off by the rmt union It made the decision after network rail made a new offer on pensions A 24-hour stoppage on london underground is still scheduled to go ahead next tuesday At least 85 people have been killed and more than 300 injured in a wave of violence in iraq just six days before an iraqi government takes over power Barnaby phillips is in bagdad The attacks happened at dawn.

Hello mark there's people as far as the eye can see here at glastonbury They're thoroughly enjoying the football boobies you want to pumping out on two huge screens And the last time i saw this many people when there wasn't a main act on stage It was on a sunday at midday when rolf harris was on Rolf harris eat your heart out. It's michael owing. They've all come to see tonight There are flags right up the hill and somebody's read the script because despite the weather predictions There's very little mud around mark and the sun is shining over glastonbury a delighted glastonbury that englander won nil up Thank you phil let's go to london then earls quarter football exhibition there mark clemett is there for us Yes, and where james wick or edinard and we're trying to make off with my broadcasting gear before i apprehended them So rather than shop them to the police. I thought we'd get that opinion on the first half one hell of a start james Oh, it's brilliant. Uh, you can't ask for more than michael owing scoring after three minutes So glad he scored because everyone's been relying on runy But absolutely brilliant start. I just hope we kind of keep it up and we're defending okay So let's just hope we keep up for the second half wick or i mean, what did you make to the rest of that half? I thought there were a couple of good own chances cambal got one just over the bar Yeah, there were a good couple of good chances, but we're just defending too deep for me It's worrying you lovey isn't it it is worrying me. I think we need to go for a second goal kill the game off Get us in the semi-finals. Thanks very much ed runy off Yeah Um if i'm not in the squad then i would be a bit, you know gutted but as i was in the squad I think we can rely on him a bit more now that runy's gone off I think the sales of runy replacement and i think we can rely on him as well I'll dem quick word on the second half. How do you see it going? I see the david james had a solid performance and i'd like to keep him up for the rest of the tournament Is that your comment? That's it. Absolutely. Well, I feel we've I feel we've emptied on a bit of a A bit of a dump squib actually. I was looking for a bit more positivity mark, but I'm gonna hand back to you. They're a bit subdued here a bit reserved. You know what i mean? It's nervous. That's why Well, I don't know. It's very tense. I was trying to kiss people with that goal, but they were running away from me What's the matter with them here? I'm not surprised. I'm not blaming them. Let's talk to graham taylor about the michael owing goal We actually haven't discussed the goal as yet. We discussed how well he's played his all-round performance But it's amazing to keep his head and it was a it's a fabulous pirouette through pretty well a full revolution Yeah, but he'd read it. I mean the two centre backs of portugal really they gave no information To costina in front of them allowed him to backpedal and had it blindly back to the keeper And in fact, uh, I think it was car value had let michael owing run and then it was a great finish for him because you know He took it early you ask any goalkeeper They don't want they don't want the early strike because they can't position themselves And just recently michael has been taken an extra touch because of that lack of confidence But here whipped it in over in a very very good finish If you're on the road for the next 45 minutes, please drive carefully if you're at home remove anything breakable Within arms reach it could be a roller coaster ride. It seems to back out the referee is back out And alan green here we go again England need another goal I don't think um This game that is so open I can't see portugal not scoring We'll see no further changes Um, so portugal's lineup is as follows. Ricardo is the goalkeeper the defenders on michael covalho andrade and mila valente And midfield of costinia and maniche They're the defensive ones ahead of them figo deco and rinaldo and the lone striker nuna gomez England have had to make the one change of course really off engine up to 26 minutes for cell on So it's james and goal defenders neville terry camber cole midfield beckham jerrod lampard scores And the striker is now on the goal scorer after less than three minutes and the cell who will be furthest forward Um, I'd like to see a bit more from beckham But that's been true of the whole of euro 2004 so far lampard flicks the ball to ashley cole cole beaten by the tackle from miguel and deco has certainly been the danger man deco Oh, wow. He gets another soft free kick So many soft free kicks being um won by deco Or at least awarded by ursmire the referee it's taken and it's forward to nuna gomez and nuna gomez To figure on the far side the portuguese left just to the left of england's penalty Checks onto his right foot not once but twice plays it back shot a chip in straight into the arms of james It was munich who lashed it in there was a good strike on the outside of his right foot. It's an inside left channel Comfortably saved by david james, but so straight away. You see that deco has gone on and played in a more advanced role Just going up alongside nuna gomez as well And i'm going forward without the try and push men forward to try and win it back And hopefully that might leave a bit of spice for viselle and ferroan england and their white shirts attacking the goal to our left in this second half And we'll play by nuna valentino the far side and then it's backed by munich to his goalkeeper rickardo Tell me this to goalkeepers escape this rule about tucking in the shirts then terry because the fourth official was Incredibly pedantic when viselle came on and rickardo has his shirt outside his shorts Nazi level empty on the far side the left back you know See the five live in the bbc england lead portugal by a golden ale and the quarter final of euro 2004 It's back and it's with figo and there's danger figo's shot though was well wide And he's disappointed You know, i just see gary neville then talking to his two central midfield players that tuck across You've got to get across if the balls are going out wide david beckham goes out wide Then it's up to gerard to get out And it's up to lampard to slide across as well and skulls That england midfielder's got to slide across and leave the least dangerous player, which is the opposite wide midfield player David james who made one worrying fumble in the first half had got away with it takes the goal kick Here's gerard can't control that header and it's with nuna gomez Who finds munich and munich looking to the right side and rinaldo cold comes short good play by rinaldo into deco Onto rinaldo again actually called excellent tackle though. He has to put it behind for a corner He had to get you had to make the tackle because it was just about inside the box And it was uh, going to go right on to rinaldo to put it into the box and uh Actually cold got back in time good good tackle first corner of the second half of portugal deco to take it from the right hand side And here it comes the corner for portugal deep and james punches it when he could easily have got that It was a good punch in the end one bounce in the title playing the far side of the field My direction sometimes soon think of a defensive midfield player to look after deco Yeah, you may have to but uh, we wouldn't take anybody off at the moment the balance of the team is not bad But uh, minglin just camped in their own half. They can't get out of the moment England holding on to one nil And they think how much they held on to one nil in the opening game of their group against france And then it all went wrong and stop each time The throw into portugal on the far side level with the edge of the england penalty area It goes back to maniche and maniche Hits it into the center circle in cavalia There's not an england player within 15 yards of the halfway line now miguel the right back and it's starved forward And here's the dangerous deco deco though That was a poor touch from him and cold hits it off the Brazilian stroke portuguese has had a play for a throw into england hold to take it And we've only played three and a half minutes in a long time to go good ball by deco and ronaldo but ronaldo was slowly react And it goes beyond him and behind for a goal kick. I mean is it really 41 minutes to go? I think we went down this road quite a few times and pretty recently as well, but uh, even though they fend him pretty well The danger is deco if he gets the ball in and around the edge of that box if he touching is down And uh, portuguese they just got to get more men into the box if possible James takes the goal kick towards the right side beckon this time's his jump Here's figo the other number seven back to maniche figo again They put a lot of the ball in this second half for jubo figo to the left side and nuno valente And nuno gomez is the only portuguese player looking in the edge of the penalty area They see a lot of the ball And in the middle of the england half Have they got the penetration that will find them an equalizer? Costinha why turn into valente figo makes the break and lampar was slow to go with him Figo gets the pass from nuno valente why turn into valente again who checks beckham is facing up Deep inside the england half valente gets the cross in james hoy fumbles again Goodness gracious that it's behind for well, maybe it's a free kick no excuse no excuse at all No valente actually crossed the ball right on the touch line the ball was houring towards the the near post David james comes terrible. I think the ball actually might have just struck the post and then david james named It was one of those ones where david james couldn't go through the post the post was in his way dropped it In the referee deemed that it was a foul on david james. I think it was gomez That fouled him when he was going for the rebound that was uh, that was pretty scary You know, I don't make many notes about players, but alongside david james name. I've got mistake waiting to happen england lead 1-0 Here's and ravi To the car of cavalia Cavalio Right footed ball upfield driven deep headed away not cleverly away new nougomas collects edge of the penalty here Campbell retrieves his earlier mistake clears it to gerard and here's lampard Gerard again gerard and gary neville both booked in the first half Gerard a little hurry there trying to find vasel and deceptive and then vasel wins it back Gerard on towards michael owen headed away by andrade once more because dingy You just feel a pressure mounting again. What what? 39 minutes to go Nunavalante in the fire this watch has got to be wrong Here's manish Manish left of the center circle to nunavalante Deco's down the left flank at the moment and Nunavalante cuts infield he's midway inside the england half and now it's to deco gary neville comes close Deco moving to his right finds figo figo checks and then he's well tackled by lampard Will the ball break hard enough towards owen it doesn't it's well played by miguel and the portuguese fans Sense that the momentum is with their team even though they trailing them by golden elv scored by michael owen With less than three minutes played in this the first of the quarter finals in euro 2004 Throw in To portugal miguel takes it and plays it to manish and manish whips the pass quickly to the far side the left flank and nunavalante Technically, they're very good. Have they got the penetration? Figo comes forward again a couple of stepovers from in we know where we're now lou learned it from Here's renauld edge of the penalty here his shot blocked well blocked by ashley coal and that rebounds out of play on the halfway line Yeah, it's typical portuguese players Isn't it they have all the ball they spread the play from left to right about nine or ten passes and then get to the edge of the box And they don't get a shot they don't get a shot on target They don't get any real chances, but they have a lot of possession which is worrying Graham taylor is alongside me the former england captain and graham and others said amongst england substitutes that Limbering up on this touchliner fill neville and no one hargues What are you what are your thoughts? It wouldn't be it wouldn't surprise me to either of them come on at all I mean portugal having so much of the possession at the present time that it is worrying And that it probably you know sooner or later. I think spend garen erickson will have to probably consider making that change Lampard towards cold under left side He's tackled and I thought he was fired by renauld but renauld gets away with it and then he plays it off ashley coal and it's going to be a throw in the portugal I mean schools isn't playing badly But he doesn't afford A great deal of defensive support to ashley coal down this england left flank terry While he's sliding across well on the balls across the other side england they're very very good in two terms of two banks of four stopping portugal really getting into the box and making chances but Still giving portugal a lot of possession. Here's nunagomas. He's supposed to be the furthest form of player for portugal And he wins a throw in An outrageous decision Well, the referee actually pointed to the lines and saying I think it's for for england and the lines went no I think it's for portugal so the referee says okay, then it's for portugal. Why not then? Eight and a half minutes gone on the second half england one portugal no Riccardo Carvalho To andrade and then drady to do the volunteer in the far side of the field Bucket goes to andrade and drady stabs it wickedly out of play. Thank you very much. We'll take that Throw in on the halfway line to england a little bit of the pace has gone out of the game Yeah, they've had a good sort of start to the second half at portugal a lot of possession no chances apart from that sort Slip by david james at the near post but they've had a lot of possession There's been nine minutes and he said sometimes you think well, they may just want out of steam Here's michael oan right of the pen here michael oan into the box and then the defender did an exceptionally well That was Carvalho He held off michael oan didn't like oan's protest But play continues it was well defended and there's michael He's got a possession goal can he find goals can't quite find goals ball taken off him by rinaldo Just a half chance for oan there Who had an absolutely fantastic first half? Now on the far side Figo the skipper once more the last of the golden generation And his international career might finish here tonight in lisbon if england win this game Figo's not finished crosses into the penalty here. Thank goodness this time. It was a clean catch by james Like I say england are defending well They're doubling up beckham and garrion evill on the figure the cross coming in right on the goal line towards an ear post One person in the box for portugal gomez well marked with a two-cent and a half james to a comfortable catch 10 minutes gone in the second half The ball might break to oan and it does break to a good run by lampard forward for cells also inside the penalty area oan plays it to lampard and lampard looking to lay it off towards goals And that's a good tackle by miguel ball breaks away david beckham very deep on the far side and beckham Flicks it over at nudival empty and then that's over hit that pass from beckham And it's through to ricardo michael oan was in wasn't in the inside right channel And beckham tried to play it through the middle to the cell comfortable take by ricardo Well graham taylor um rightly said the other day in the creation match what you need are eight or nine players to play really well David beckham is yet to play but he's won a free kick here. There was a foul and it's a yellow card hooray Costina But I don't really say hooray because I think the referee has been exceptionally lenient with the portuguese players and not so with england I can't believe christina goes up to beckham and says you dived there, but uh I would say to costina you ever wear the one or two of your players particularly your forward very deco in ronaldo and say Hang on a minute. Is i think his pot calling the kettle black here on that situation. I've got a crystal ball here's fill level on for skulls I told you it's too open and deco's being afforded too much room Well he is and uh, it's interesting to see here what uh, if jared comes out to the left hand side Fill level yes jared come to the left hand side fill never going alongside frank lampard in the heart of that Even defense Uh, it's too much as I thought it's too far out this free kick for a shot from david beckham You would think 40 yards outside so he takes a short to skulls back to beckham jared's made the run into the left edge of the penalty area and the ball is played by beckham to jared jared controls it He said back to ashley call well done call that was another foul challenge by nunagomas Cole continues crosses into the penalty area and basel jumped But not before ricardo would caught the ball there's a comfortable take but basel gets up pretty quickly I'm pleased that jared to be fair is out to his left hand side We saw it again switzerland when he went out here when he scored from this position as well that he's he's athletic He's quick and he gives him the sort of extra dimension down as that's like cold. They help cold. Well, yeah, miguel hits it forward Cole and uh, rinaldo collided The referee has decided it's a free kick to portugal And scolari looked as if he wanted ashley Cole booked Well, it was one of those ones rinaldo just plays it It was a fire He plays it inside and then Cole's come to win the ball is committed rinaldo plays it on the move tries to get the other side of ashley Cole ashley Cole says no you're not pulls him down free kick Chalvin it's played in the second half england won portugal little here In the study of the lutz in lisbon and now portugal have a corner after Tackled by cambo on the uh, beagle Beagle the skipper for portugal to take this corner from the right hand side And then have everybody back inside the penalty again. There it goes didn't beat the first uh defender Who was david beckham beckham's headed away? Deco uh was alert to the Presence of all now he flicks it over on and he tried to flick it into the penalty here It's headed out of play by phil neville Figo with a throw in to deco once more neville comes close It's forward to feagle feagle to deco first time cross into the penalty here towards the far post towards christina Headed into ronaldo ronaldo heads at howling white Well in the first game against greece a corner came in from the far side It was ronaldo that got his head to the ball, but he's had two chances since that match One against spain when the ball came in from the left hand side Which he put over the bar once then a header back across to great header back across and it was ronaldo They got in front of sol cambo. It was a difficult chance in a way You have to really sort of crane his neck right along the six yard line right level with the near post put it over the bar Each time he's played for the starter he's come on ronaldo has been a serious aerial threat To every other defense. He's a big lad, isn't he? He's quite big, you know, he's like piresse He's big and once you get alongside him and see him against the other players He's very tall england fans aware that the pressure is on try to encourage the side england leading by a goal to nil and we've got That's sick and we've played 59 minutes Oh It's hard work when it's this much pressure Miguel back to deco deco Slips the ball to his left to andrade andrade up to the halfway line and nunavalante Overwhelmingly the game being played in the england half It's it for ronaldo's switch banks with figo and ronaldo heads it behind for a goal kick and it's the nerve to complain That was a definite goal kick well played gary neville It was one of those ones giving go where ronaldo laid the ball back And then went for the for the ball over to top in the left wing area gary neville actually headed the ball against ronaldo Ronaldo had the cheek to claim the corner Graham taylor to my right Graham The right move to bring on full level. Well, I think it is because I think they've got to try to stop deco playing to sort of they can so they can get a foot into the game because Really in this half we've done so little for Going forward having said that we have we've defended well We've restricted the opportunities that portugal have and that's very importantly continue to do that But I think he's made a right decision interesting Samal will be coming on shortly for portugal now wonder will that be for ronaldo or will it be another attacking threat for portugal It's hit forward towards figo who was falling gamble But gamble did well enough to find co here's phil neville the brother gary in the far side Back to phil and and neville this neville the younger neville heads it towards the halfway line where it's headed back by nunavalante And picked up by nunavalante who's dropped very deep. He gives it away Ashley Cole slides it forward oan is there cavalos with him oan Holes the ball up very well well played michael oan. He's having an exceptional game back to phil neville into beckham inside the center circle Vacell peels away But beckham decides safety first just a little bit of his right to gary neville back to beckham And then into the center circle it goes once more good footfall from england cambo to jerrod and jerrod While he he hurried that pass forward to oan He could have just beat the defender and kept the ball As it is he conceded possession, but it's one back now by terry and terry trying to squeeze it through to oan And again doesn't hit the pass from lean up here's figo down the right side Who would somal come on in your book for terry possibly figo Figo well that would be fascinating here is figo who's tackled by lampar And the ball breaks away to the far side to the halfway line and deco Deco being hustled by pacell can only find the head of back in the heads that had a plan here is the chain Or is it not quite yet? Oh, you got a turkey shirt in Yeah, pull up your socks. Yeah, pull up your socks took a shirt in. Oh, he's not telling him to tuck his shirt in Brush your head. It only applies to england players. Maybe Here's nuno gumis a good ball left from maniche taken up again by nuno gumis the shot was fiebel Easily safe Yeah comfortable save it was a good tackle by sol cambo I think with the ball squirrelling how to go meze edge of the box left for comfortable safer james right down the middle One another do fine, but there's a long way to go. Here's michael oni's already squad Goodness gracious. What's the referee giving a free kick for a foul by basel? Sounded on i looked unlikely here's the change And uh, it's oh castin is coming off somal coming on. I mean you've got a hand in the scolari He doesn't look around with changes. No, he doesn't the whole emphasis will change with this He thinks about it. He really does the brazilian He's a tough nut as england remember from two years ago taken brazil To winning the world cup and as michael's saying earlier. No foreign manager has won the european championship for a country portugal trailingland by goldson ill That's with miguel miguel was somehow inside the pender miguel checking towards the box Good tackle by jared ball breaks the fiegel fiegel swirls in the cross bunches inside the six yard box And is it still in play? No truly gone behind for a goal kick it has And uh grand ten i want to bring you in again because he is he's a smart boy He's taken his holding midfield player off But he's put maniche back into that position there although maniche is very capable of coming forward as well I think they're two very interesting substitutions, but i honestly do believe that both of them are correct Absolutely, we played 18 minutes As soon as the start of the second half is just five live on the bbc england lead portugal 1-0 in the first of the four quarter finals in euro 2004. Here's lampard lost possession did lampard andrade to nunavalente back to the goalkeeper ricardo And ricardo lashes it upfield surely straight onto the head of soul cambal cambal heads it down but away from jara And here's miguel england fans singing in the background Figo Just on the edge of the center circle being hustled by filneville spends away from filneville lampards in there to win the ball Then oh lampard wins it a second time though. He can't keep possession for england instead. He concedes a throw it 19 minutes played in the second half forgive me if i keep looking at the clock i'm trying to rush it on folks Trying to do this for everybody's sake one nil to england deco Still looks the most dangerous player to me deco heading it towards urinal though Cole jumps into sets with his left foot and cushions the volley out of play for another throw it miguel to take it About 20 yards inside the england half Throws it to figo figures just now in the center Of that midfield hoping to provoke a problem for england figo again Not a good ball forward from the captain filneville finds for sell for sell back to gerard and gerard thought about david james changes mind And now he hits it upfield towards michael on on well marked by carvalho And then let's uh manish you hits it back to carvalho and all the way back to the goalkeeper ricardo and ricardo That swirls the clearance towards the halfway line gerard jumpson seemed to use his hand there but play continues rinaldo picks it up for Portugal back to figo nuno valente's down the far side so to his samal and nuno gomas fell over there nuno valente to samal once more the ventfiga winger Um despite playing on the wing he scored most goals this season for ventfiga and he takes up the ball again and he should set its way Thank heavens. You know a wonderful play from samal. He got the ball on the left hand side played it inside Then went right across the line of the england's back four picked it up Campbell closed on the edge of the box david james in amnesty where he's about two yards wide of his left hand post samal has gone to the left wing rinaldo's come across to the right when still got nuno gomas through the middle and it's figo playing a more advanced role with Deco as well as munice that's sitting there james with a goal kick back and goes down on the far side right in front Of the lineman and the referee looks at the lineman, but it's not a free kick. It's only a throw in to england scallari shouts instructions from the portuguese dugout Gary neville throws it down the right flank headed away by andrade And here's samal and samal to nuno gomas good tackle by john terry aggressive and fair hard out of play it goes at 24 minutes left for play here in lisbon england won portugal nil michael all scored it seemed an awful long while ago That's a good ball forward to on on fine for sell now jarrod and on running towards the penalty area for sell onto his left foot Calls it in not going to reach steven jarrod not a great clearance by miguel jarrod brings it down a couple of yards outside the penalty area Decide to take on miguel on the outside and then he plays it into the viziga right back Nui's going to throw in good place steven jarrod Well, that's generally been all portugal in the second half waves of off the wave of attack on the end of the defense But england does still have that threat with oan and visell of one ball through one bit of interplay between the two and there could be a chance uh put to go win the ball back and figo plays it forward, but that's uh Too far ahead of rinaldo. It's out of play. It's going to be a throw into england almost on the halfway line tell neville um was the second england substitute Vasell had to come on in the first half because runny has a problem. I think with his right ankle It's possible that andrade Accidentally or otherwise stood on it. So runny had to be substituted Here's figo inside the center circle good play by louis figo now samao on the far side Nuno gomez looks over his right shoulder. Is there any support for him? Samao cuts in into nuno gomez But it's back to go trying to slip it back england should clear this they do clear Ashley Cole hits it towards the halfway line andrade climbing all over visell And the header reaches miguel onto rinaldo good tackle by cole Still the pressure on midway through the second half See it through michael Well, I can't imagine what it must be like listening to this back home I know how we're feeling the tension here in the commentary box A quarter of the game to go most of the second half being played inside the england half His deco of portul 25 yards out feeds rinaldo near side the field portugal building with rinaldo. Ashley Cole Eventually gets his challenge and it's a corner kick, but it's just like It's just like the game against france just like argentina and let's hope it's a different conclusion from england's point of view It's a corner kick to portugal near side the field and it'll be taken by deco Lots of red and green inside the penalty area More testing moments for david james and it goes james gets both hands Brilliant leads the ball on this occasion doesn't fist it And tumbles over and makes the save He just saw david james just wander off his line and as the ball was coming in from the right hand side It was an out swing on right on this six yard box came and took it very very well That was much better There's a huge gap between england strikers in the midfield as they have a rare moment inside the portuguese half and miguel recovers Under pressure from the england's goal scorer michael oan. England won Portugal nil you're listening to five live michael oan scoring inside the first three minutes john terry having his best match of the tournament so far steven jerrard the portuguese player lying injured And uh, well jerrard very sportingly Will put the ball out of play so is it nuno gomez? Can receive attention gomez of course replacing powelletta philip neville of all people Has come on remember it was ursmire who gave the penalty against him In that last game of euro 2000 and philip neville tonight is winning his 50th cap For england having come on for his manchester united teammate Poor skulls the england players just getting some refreshment the portuguese as well nuno gomez is all right And portugal will just give the ball back one would assume here to england with 20 minutes to go Um, and they do give the ball back and that has to be the way david james and the england goal away to our right 20 and a half minutes to go here in lisbon james clears england not carrying a lot of goal threat at the moment they could deally do with the second as beckham heads the Board into the area for sell there with his great pace He got the ball and he's looking for a corner kick and ursmire's given it Ursmire's given the corner to england now under so much pressure at the other end Can england score a second here which was surely at this stage? Put them into the semi-final david beckham takes his time John terry steps forward Sol cambal is there as well england need good delivery In goes the corner kick from david beckham terry headed the ball down It's an easy pickup for ricardo now england need to cover those defenders as portugal come on the counterattack And it's a great challenge from ashley coal On ricardo um, no rinaldo. Sorry ashley coal having a magnificent tournament at left back But here come portugal one nil they trail the ball is with deco slanted in by deco towards nuno gomez nuno gomez Has the board and the schmow excellent block coming in from philip neville. That's why he's come on and david beckham just hoisted a big High ball Into the crowd over on the far side the field, but england do need to keep it They mustn't just keep planting it back to portugal into the last 20 minutes of the game the quarter final on five life england leading after three minutes through michael oe But hanging on here and it's agony at times the ball is with rinaldo of portugal a bit wayward to miguel But he gets there anyway, and it's now deco for portugal up against philip neville onto louis figo Twisting and turning on the edge of the area Miguel now with an opportunity to get this one in great challenge coming in from frank lampard There's nothing on for him at the moment in terms of counterattacking plays the sensible ball to viselle Visell now setting off against cavallo good pace from the villaman great recovery from the porto defender And england win a corner kick near cyber left cavallo got back in time because visella just got past him Miguel the right back from portugal was up with the attack. There was a big space there Visell just pushed the ball into the space and went past him But cavallo got back with a great recovery tackle to concede a corner england just taking their time as they should do From a corner situation. They've been deceived in the second half Let's tell you what there's one or two breakaways with a nearly got in behind that portuguese defense The second goal would kill it for england the sell took a long time to get up only john terry this time goes forward Sol cambal stays back David beckham with an england corner near side the field the left four england players in the area headed away by portugal You can have a chance to play this one back in again lampard on the volley trying to release david beckham by the corner flag Beckham turns and then all he does is turn the ball out of play and portugal have a throw portugal about to make another Substitution england i've got oen hargrews warming up down the side as well. It's postiga. That's going to come on for portugal Well, wouldn't that be an irony if the man who's failed to score and make any impact really for spurs Comes on and devastates england here in lisbon england leading one little michael oen jumping with the defender andrally And this time michael oen's got it He's got the sell there as well oen's running square with the ball at the moment on the edge of the area Little dink ball down the left hand side to david beckham two england players in the area beckham's fired it wide to the far side Got the call from gary neville. This is a bit better now from england, but they need a second Gary neville in the area. It's a bit congested in goes across ricardo punches only a snow lampard doesn't control it Philip neville can't get it away from louis figo and now portugal looking to break in steps john terry once more Ball is back inside the portuguese half. That's where it needs to be But now gerard is taken out of the game as portugal come on a break and the ears danger for england as schmow lays the ball to louis figo figo ambles into the area one nil to england figo's there sets it up maybe for deco No, in comes ashley goal And england looking to break and portugal preparing to make a second Substitution maybe numo gomos will go off as a long one now hoisted forward by beckham finds gerard headed on by gerard in the area Out comes the goalkeeper And ricardo dives at the feet of steven gerard and this game opens up once more as portugal prepared across the halfway line And we've still 16 minutes to go portugal trying to stretch england down this near side with ronaldo against ashley Cole ronaldo still against ashley Cole the cross will come in from miguel and it'll be cleared by cambell Not very far though on the edge of the area back come portugal One nil to england hanging on for long periods here Deco to figo can he inspire the host country here louis figo figo shoot gets a deflection james turns it round the post Good save by david james. Good save by david james who's going the wrong way There was a massive deflection on the edge of the box He got low down to his right hand side deflected it for a corner short corner taken england need to concentrate And in fact the corner will have to be Taken again. I think because the change will be made and louis figo Takes off his captain's armband He got his 100th cap in february against england And he's going to make a long walk and this could be the last time And from an england point of view, let's hope it is Although he's being one of the great great players of the last 10 15 years louis figo will be replaced here by helder postiga of Spurs on comes postiga Figo is out of the game Here comes the corner for portugal Trailing here by one goal to nil number 23 postiges come on Cavallo the defender and andrade's gone forward headed away. Well by camble terrific header Just over 15 minutes to go in lisbon on five live Manish now with a great ball which is beautifully controlled by rinaldo rinaldo lifts the ball in Attempted overhead kick by portugal cleared by gerard downfield. He doesn't know find uh michael owens against nudo valente valente with a recovery owens looking for a free kick ball spins away for a throwing to winglin over on the far side owen was almost through there But to be fair to nuno valente he came back strongly to deny the little ball striker Well, there's always that threat just over fifth We just under 15 minutes of the match to go and portugal have got to push more men forward They got postiga on now with gome as it's a double strike force have changed it around a little bit Then they're just going to go three at the back and push people forward and there's more space If england can select the right pass forward to vissel and for own they can get that killer second goal second goal for england And surely that would be enough to clinch a semi final and a six day rest And the hope that wane ruini can recover from the injury, but let's not talk about that valente now for portugal He's just put it out of play and we've 14 minutes to go. I just want to say that louis figo just So the slope round the pitch came off the pitch straight down a tunnel didn't go to the bench He's not watching the rest of the action. It's going to be a goal kick To portugal and lios as terry was saying louis figo went straight down the tunnel not impressed by that substitution and Scolari will make his third and final change in a moment for portugal Trailing here. They've been behind ever since the third minute when michael oen scored his first goal of the tournament But england hanging on they picked up yellow cards to gary neville under Stephen jarred and they've lost wane ruini with an injury long ball forward by portugal headed away by john terry Campbell is there on the edge of the penalty area and needs a good steady clearance And it's out of play and ruy costar I think the man who really ran the game four years ago in einhoven ruy costar of milan Is going to come on in a moment for portugal another great hero of course in this country like figo now beckham Beckham good ball from beckham to vasel england Rani on the halfway line as lampard lifts it too wide, but oen will give up the chase. I think eventually And it's going to be a portugal throw. They haven't made the change yet No, you know why because they haven't got the piece of paper. I think for the fourth official It's got to be correct. There's got to be a the most decent handover Is I think the fourth official just gone through ruy cost They just made sure that the teeth are okay. The hair's fine and everything's all set deco for portugal Looking for ronaldo down the far side great challenge from gary neville Nuno Gomez now has got the support of postiga alongside in england have been caught offside the free kick must go back another 10 yards And eventually taken And here come portugal now with deco with 12 minutes to go It's a real onslaught here from the home side chasing the game england really not producing much threat at the other end But they're defending superbly Sven Jorn Ericsson said a few days ago that he wouldn't change his back for for any of the other backfors in this tournament Well now portugal have to absolutely go for it here They're bringing on creative players. They're taking off the defender miguel the right back And ruy costo, but he won't play right back. Well, let's just see how they're going to Adjust here now. I think deco has just come out to the right-hand side ruy costo maniche Or in the middle They've virtually got a three-man attack with samar With nuno Gomez and with postiga up front ronaldo just drifting into the midfield So the original shape has been scrapped here by scolari in the second half of this game england are 11 and a half minutes away from a semi-final. We'll hear from graham taylor in a moment It's a throw to england over on the far side. They just need now some moments on the ball It's a throw to portugal wide on the left far side of the field It'll be taken by the fullback valente gives ruy costo his first touch england know all about the danger from ruy costo Portugal now with Maniche It comes to deco down this near side. Ashley Cole's got deco up against him now It's a ruy costa trying to impose himself in the game settles into the rhythm of the match straight away offside is given And graham taylor, let's hear from you well I'm struggling at the moment to come to terms with what scolari has done to his team shape He has made all of a sudden the three substitutions And it's I think he's almost saying go on you're gonna have to play which I can understand to a degree He's left himself very short with I think the chance that england can break at them and can get that second goal I would say that defensively england have played very well against a lot of possession that the portuguese side have had But the ball is coming back constantly at the england team 10 minutes away from winning this game the ball is now with nuno gomes Over on the far side the field portugal having all the possession in this second half Still a lot of work for spenior and arikson's team to do here england inviting portugal onto them at times in goes across james will say that And we are now just over 10 minutes away from the end of this game in lisbon portugal remember As oin hargrews prepares to come on undefeated in this city since 1987 Volley back by maniche john terry is there hargrews to come on to try and give england a little more composure A little more possession maybe here come portugal again across comes john terry having a terrific game alongside soul cambell But the clearance only drops to nuno valente and portugal have the initiative once more postigas there up against terry Spurs against chelsea excellent ball from postiga ruy costas shot is charged down by cambell This is agonizing at times for england and the cross comes jerrod before deco Compose any problems near side of the field now england will make their change And the man coming off is steven jerrod oin hargrews is coming on jerrod is looking tired He's on a yellow card remember in this game So oin hargrews who's recovered from the illness that kept him out of contention for the game against croatia Makes way Comes on for steven jerrod jerrod looking he's run himself into the ground here steven jerrod So hargrews joins phillip neville in midfield and lampard and beckham And england are just over eight minutes away from victory here in the stadium of lights ruy costa back on the halfway line for portugal finds cavallo the defender In goes oin hargrews and does just enough there to prevent portugal making progress down this near side You're listening to five live Eight and a half minutes to go in lisbon and steve mcclaren says come on don't drop sidi push up Don't give portugal all the initiative here because there's still time for the host to come back england will Surely start to tire as well on the that was a tire clearance by lampard He had come portugal regrouping on the edge of the penalty area. It's postiga feeding Shimau down the left hand side his ball in he's going to get another opportunity Shimau collects himself in comes across over terry headed in by postiga Would you believe it held a postiga of torn them hosper Who's made no impact at all in england has headed an equalizer for portugal with seven and a half minutes to go And the problem was it had been coming for a long time as england was forced to keep portugal of equalized Well, would you believe that what a substitution from scolari is virtually playing with four forwards Simao got the ball the first cross was blocked by david beckham It fell to his right foot and he just picked postiga out He had the simplest of headers and six yards unmarked in the box over the top of john terry Sol camble had a man ashley kohl had a man the spare man was postiga and he just glanced it past david james no chance So near Not quite as dramatic as the french game But england had been stung And now england have to do it all over again And the possibility of extra time starts to loom and england are looking tired Lampard now trying to find michael o in england now must push forward with this Reshape side now, of course they taken off steven gerrard. They've taken off paul scolars They had to take off wane runey and portugal with the home crowd behind them now have the initiative As gary neville heads the ball out of play to the far side It's portugal won england won in the quarter final of euro 2004 and the referee gives portugal a free kick and england need real concentration here now Both the games Sven Jörn-Eriksen played against portugal the friendlies ended 1-1 This one now locked on the same score line It's a portugal free kick And they've got schemao who of course was so instrumental in the goal They've got ruy costar as well And they've got postigo waiting in the airing valente's gone forward Free kick is taken and it goes headed away by john terry not very far in england It's coming onto them all the time here from the men in red and green and here they come again the home side portugal raiding down the left hand side across comes gary neville And it's out of play for portugal throwing. We just over five minutes to go of normal time england won portugal one ball with portugal inevitably portugal looking to try and tease the england defenders then the cross comes in and this time john terry gets his head to the ball Vesal is all on his own He's got no one into sport and then he's fouled By deco and deco will get a yellow card for that. It's a free kick to england and here's graham taylor Well, I One could argue that has been coming But the way it came was a surprise Once the first cross had been put out in the second cross In the penalty box the england defenders had plenty of time to assess what was round about them They weren't able to do that and postiga came in and got in between the defenders to equalize It's a matter now I was not saying well, we've got to go and win it in the next few minutes You've got to hold you've got to get yourself into the game There could yet be that period of extra time to come in and win it But it's a shame. It's a surprise that they lost the The equalizing goal by what would call an english type cross Is the first goal england have conceded from open play in this tournament And it's changed the whole atmosphere in this stadium england sitting too deep Portugal coming forward once more the ball is not in play ronaldo didn't manage to keep it in And england are four minutes away from the final whistle here plus out of time and maybe four minutes or so away from extra time Soul Campbell now england needs some possession Maniche is in the way for portugal Maniche england were unable to get the second which would have finished portugal off David beckham now has been penalized by ozmae and portugal take the free kick quickly england tired of course in the quarterfinal against brazil two years ago We're flagging a bit here portugal trying to win it in normal time They don't want extra time shot comes in and it's wasted this time And a goal kick to england david james to take it and this is why england now need a little bit of help and a bit of support from the bench They certainly do they just want to try and kill it if they can and just regroup into extra time but This is one of those what one of those ones where you have to add mascalari the portuguese coach because he pushed four men forward It was very brave. It was very bold. He knew about the counterattack from england But it was a soft goal to give away as one of those goals that you look back and you say why why Did we just pick up and mark and leave the spare man if there was one hargreys can't find knowing Scalari is in the tent is almost on the pitch down there There's no one from england though in the technical area trying to inspire from the sideline as Portugal clear ashley coals underneath it with a header trying to play in hargreys hargreys against deco And that's gone out of play for a portuguese throwing We've less than three minutes to go the england supporters are trying to lift their side We're heading for extra time in this first quarter final Silver goals and penalties of course Many people forecast this would be decided by penalties, but we're still a long long way away from that scenario It's portugal with a clearance from andrade looking for rinaldo rinaldo faced by ashley coal and hargreys Portugal having non-stop possession here in the second half. It's ruy costa onto miguel miguel into the area trying to find post again that was over hit and um, it's a goal kick that england Have been stung Right at the end of this game Like they were not quite so dramatically against france in the opening match one one And you just sensed terry that the forces were portugal at the moment Yeah, the force has been with portugal all the second half really has been one-way traffic with the first sporadic attacks from england But i thought the storm was weathered. I thought they've they've done it But you you never say never and against france as well. You thought that they've done it, but they hadn't You can see the goal now They've got to see it out to to extra time and these are the these players have to get through I think portugal are made three substitutions england have made three substitutions as well So these players if it does go to extra time, they've got to they've got to play Portugal once more moving forward ruy costa such a vital player to be able to bring on in this second half high ball towards rinaldo too high and uh At least portugal haven't gone on since they scored that equalizer and england have hung in there Philip neville to david beckham who's drifted into the center circle beckham turns on the ball against ruy costa Feeds philip neville philip neville lifts it forward trying to play the ball over andrade That's a header away and it was well judged by andrade. Otherwise viselle was looking for the bits and pieces Ball with that given away by portugal by cavallo, but it was a good recovery a referee's given the free kick against uh cavallo against His challenge on hargree's He's correct as well. That was a one minute to go of normal time And can this be the moment for england because there would be no coming back for portugal If they could finish this one off and this time cambell as he must do goes forward with john terry If ever there was a moment for david beckham to deliver one of his better free kicks, this is it england free kick right at the end of the game and it goes headed against the bar Campbell's should be the goal by england Campbell has scored the referee out has the referee given the goal. Oh, no, he hasn't and the game continues I thought what on earth is happening the ball is now with shimow england thought they'd won the game right at the end And we've got three minutes of added time portugal shoot over the bar now explain all that to me Well when the header came in i'm not too sure if it came off john terry or sol cambell the ball Fuddler against the crossbar came off sol cambell sol cambell then got up and there was two players They went up john terry and sol cambell the goalkeeper was nowhere near the ball He wasn't fouled he was blocked if anything on the goal line cambell thought he'd scored just like argentina 1998 englander thought they got the winner the referee gave the free kick and then portugal broken it was two on one against england Just like the game against argentina in san eddie n cambell thought he'd done it We thought he'd done it all the england fans thought he'd done it We're now playing added time here at the end of the 90 minutes john terry for england long ball four looking for oan and the Goalkeeper will get that riccardo Well if england don't win this game now, what a talking point that is going to prove to be at the end of the match What a talking point urs meyers performance will be as well as the referee long ball into the england half philip neville doesn't get it First time maybe that will inspire england forward if they feel that they've been hard done by here The ball now needs clearing by john terry and he knocks it a long way into the crowd over on the far side It's portugal won england won and we're playing added time at the end of the 90 minutes three minutes of added time Now england have to be careful themselves. They thought they'd won the game if portugal get a goal now It will be all over The ball is with the Costa long ball to this near side the field to deco deco is now playing wide on the right Close down by hargree's ashley coal comes in once more to win the ball hargreeves and coal together near side Lampard looking for hargreeves We can hear the england fans singing as hargreeves was tripped a couple of times still managers across the halfway line Still hargreeves are in ahead of him and he loses his footing Well, he was fouled two or three times there as he tried to get forward And now hargreeves gets up slowly and portugal counterattack Lampard and coal switched in field and the referee's given a free kick now against lampard on deco Free kick to portugal added time in lisbon One more chance maybe for the hosts And the ball is with nuno valente down the left hand side Gomez and postigar ahead of him Portugal keeping the ball with ruy costa england thought they'd won it with a minute to go from cambo shimau who made the equalizer england mustn't let him get the crossing the ball is out of play far side And it's going to be a portuguese throw that can hardly be any seconds left And spenior and ericsson will have to come on soon with steve mclaran samy lee to lift the england team for extra time throw to portugal far side Postigar the goal scorer comes towards the ball the cross comes in Looking for nuno Gomez with a weak header That's gone wide and the signs since equal england conceded the goal have been reasonably encouraging And that they haven't fallen apart here and they've given quite a good account of themselves over the last five minutes Yeah, that was well played from here. There's a great free kick from beckham here. Camel up in the air But back come portugal slow to react beckham should have got that and the shot is driven in by portugal over the bar But what is beckham thinking about that really needed more commitment england captain screaming at gary neville? I'm not sure why whistle goes for the end of the 90 minutes we will have Extra time we're not quite sure how much extra time because of course the silver goals will apply steve mclaran is the first man on the pitch Once everyone to come towards him We've got extra time as one or two of us always expect who we might have here Score here england one portugal one Let's just remind you of the rules any team leading after the first 15 minutes of extra time is declared the winner So they will play the 15 minutes whatever even if someone scores they will carry on and play the 15 minutes The italians have talked about a scandal I'm going to get graham taylor's view in a second on that highly controversial decision To rule out that late england goal 606 is going to come up about 15 minutes after the end of this game with mark bright 0500 909 693 606 interactive let's quickly knit back to london dahlia rafael has the news Thanks mark the headlines the rmt unions called off next week's national rail strike because network rail has tabled an improved offer on Pensions but the union says a planned 24-hour walk out on the london underground will still go ahead on tuesday iraq suffered one of its worst days of violence today since the fall of san amersen 100 people were killed and hundreds more wounded in a wave of attacks in the center and north of the country And police in turkey have detained two men and a woman in connection with this afternoon's bomb explosion on a bus in istanbul At least three people died Thanks, dahlia now. We've seen some action replays. We've been told about them apparently john terry graham taylor did have his arm Over ricardo the portuguese goalkeeper and the linesman gave it Okay, I mean it's very easy isn't it for us to say what is important now mark? We can talk about that but down there looking at spengar and ericsson going around his players You really have got it. You're not going to change that what is vital for these players at the moment minds are cleared Into except you're still in this game. This game is there still to be won What's happened has happened you've got to put that out of the mind And even if i doubt whether they're talking about it But you've got to stop them talking about it and get on with it from our point of view It looked initially a very clean goal having looked at it later on you do see terry impeding the goalkeeper I thought for a second we were going to have arson tina at 98 all over again because the referee Allowed them well, i'm not even sure they did take a free kick. Did they seem to almost surprise anything about it? Well, they must have taken a free kick. Well, he's gone in there. No, I didn't see anything We did because the ball seemed to be well away But they must have taken it out of the net put it down and gone on with it The portuguese equalizer talk us through it from your expert point of view in terms of the defending and john terry in particular He thinks out, you know, I think john terry has come on to his game very much in the in the second half I was having a very good game I thought he started slowly but when the ball went out to the flank position after the first cross had been knocked There was no looking round by him to see where players were And in fact what happened then postiga came in and sol camber got two players near him and pot It came over john terry's head and we're just looking at it again and you'll see actually the look round and it comes over and and Sol looked at him. Is that that's what you call in the trade just ball watching I'm saying that he ball watched a lot. He didn't look round enough to see where the danger was because whilst the ball's out in the flank It's no threat. The threat is what's about you? Where are the players? So you have to have a look and see what's happening and I have to say that john didn't do that Well, we're just seeing a replay again of the hit some right at the end And it's happened in real time head on to the crossbar now Let's try and talk you through it at home and john terry definitely has his left arm over the goalkeeper's shoulder And the goalkeeper's made sure he's gone down. All right, the lineman's given it I mean, some people would say that the referees are a protected species You know, not even the dodo had the protection the goalkeepers have but it's the same both ends Is that what we have to say? Yeah, look at it again Of course the lineman and the referee don't have the advantage that we have and he's jumping and he's hands it And it does come down on the keeper. He doesn't leave himself up off the keeper So I think we're a little bit unfortunate Be very interested to see what would have happened if it had been goal the at the other end Terry Butcher When the ball hits the crossbar and it goes up in the air Both cambell and terry have their eyes fixed on the ball to try and attempt the ball In fact cambell comes over to top of terry and heads it in the back of the net I don't think john terry deliberately obstructs the goalkeeper I think the goalkeeper makes a complete hash of it flaps at it And the referee makes a complete hash of it in my opinion and this allows the goal Graham, how will england how should england approach this first 15 minutes? Well it now is a question is that you're in the game It's you will have chances and what you've got to do you've got to When I say take the game to them you've got to make sure that we play more of the game If it's a tall possible in the portuguese half We're not going to get anything unless it's just a breakaway now By in fact allowing the portuguese to have so much possession of the ball What I will say when I couldn't quite see what scolaria done. He's done very very well I tell you he's gone for it and decos played in three positions You could argue he's playing it right back now, but he's actually pushed postiga in with Gomez and actually he has gone for the game. So give them credit. They probably deserve the equalizer Ersmire has just tossed the coin again because you do toss up again for extra time at england They're going to play the way they were in the first half. It's going to be 15 minutes Whatever happens however many goals allen green describes it will be 15 minutes allen They've gone 334 portugal. That's what they've done Excuse my voice a bit hoarse having a certain might of shouting at the referee, but I think unfortunately Campbell's goal was rightly disaligned Terry filed the goalkeeper No golden goal remember that applied four years ago and eight years ago A silver goal means that if a team take the lead an extra time and hold on to that lead Uh until after 15 minutes have been played that will be the final score Uh the ball is out of play on the far side of the field. It's going to be a throw into england Disrevised England line up though the formation remains substantially the same Hargreaves takes a throw towards the cell Knocked away and there's Campbell heading it forward again called back heels the ball doesn't reach Derrius for sell and then lampard in there but dives in there and doesn't get the ball and it's driven forward Deep bounces inside the six not the six yard box the d of the england penalty area and through to david james My james Well, he made one excellent save from figo shot that was deflected. There were a couple of early moments that went dark clever It's one one here in lisbon and no one seriously can deny that portugal deserved to equalize the momentum was with them Throughout the second half all the pressure was on england james slices of clearance It doesn't even reach the halfway line. Terry has the ball died and there's an offside flag raised against postiga england Have the ball and the free kick Terry lashes it towards michael oan the card of cavaleo heads it away hargreaves is there hargreaves faced by Deco who's playing right midfield now and then hargreaves on comes forward deco Tackles and beats him and here's christiana ronaldo up over the halfway line and he's still running forward That's gonna be a yellow card. I suspect filing his club colleague And ursmire loves to flash the yellow in english faces Yeah, he's definitely right on that occasion ronaldo picked the ball up and hargreaves are giving the ball away But um ronaldo was faced with ashley colin fill never pushed it past Ashleigh coler fill never slid in didn't make contact with the ball foul ronaldo definitely Looking and it's a free kick at a chance for the forties to get men in the box Wide on the touch line on the right hand side Deco's gonna take it re costa lurking ominously On the d the edge of the d the england penalty here comes decos free kick not a great one Had it died to re costa re costa shot almost ronaldo the flags up for offside And just coming out on the edge of the box here and uh I'm too sure was it pastiga that caught it ronaldo caught it but uh Two players offside when the good clearance from england's point of view, but that was a scary moment Well, well done deras for south keeping that ball and playing the fire Well, I thought he kept it in play by ronjama long way away in the linesman could look along the line He says no he didn't and it's a throw into portugal Yeah, will there be caution in this situation terry? No, you just have to go for it if he possibly can you know that if you if you score the goal It's still got to go the 15 minutes in that first period Of course if you if it's no nil then at one no goals then it still goes to the The full distance of 120 minutes. So it's a bit cat and mouse. Uh david beckham surely brought down and there was uh A little boot towards beckham, but it's a free kick beckham takes it finds michael oan just outside the penalty area oan having to retreat though and that's not good from oan It's taken up now for portugal And here's postiga the goal scorer stepping inside fill level. He can't make another bar tackle The pass goes to ronaldo engles ashley cold winning it fairly Campbell heads it away beckham's not going to restart step forward again by portugal outcomes james And he catches that ball. We've already played three and a half minutes of the first 15 minutes of extra time We might not need 30, but we might have to get 30 and then heaven help us The ball is still with javid james. I think england actually recovered well having considered equalizer terry Yeah, they have um when when portugal went for it and applying the three at the back and three and they're feeling four up Never says, you know, you sort of think well, it's a very very wide open game in the house They're vulnerable then to one ball over the top four oan and four of a cell but You know, they just have to sometimes try and alter that shape if they possibly can portugal But I think both teams are going for it deco looking for an alder and alder broke forward too quickly and he's offside But wearing the lampard gave the ball away there another carelessly england mustn't do that Free kick to england four minutes gone an extra time here in lisbon It's one one between the host portugal and england beckham's on the right side He was manhandled there by an inner valente the ball goes out of play That's a throw in to england when it could easily have been a free kick Beckham They're not unreasonably looks exhausted This could be his moment This could be his moment Throw in For england taken by gary neville to fill neville back to gary neville neville Squeeze the ball through legs of some mile back to fill neville fill neville's cross slightly deflected Headed clear for cell brings it down new to valente clears fill level rises heads it further forward and downed by vacelle But he's the judge to have filed the defender and rari and it's a freak you could portugal It's a very scrappy first five minutes of extra time I think I think all sets of both sets of players are pretty tired They put a lot of effort into it as a good tempo to the game. It was very open Wasn't it was end to end football in the 90 minutes and both Both sets of players deserve a great deal of plays for their for their stamina, but With tiredness comes mistakes Ricardo with a free kick up to the edge of the england penalty area good header away by terry And it's a throw into portugal midway inside The england half left for nuno valente to take back. It goes to rui costa rui costa onto his Right foot and he slides it away to the far side and englander back defending again as deco put the ball into the penalty well chested down in there by nunogomas But he couldn't get the shot in rui costa flicks it forward again. Here's danger for england Howl was that a handball terry went across and may have snucked him up the face either way It's behind for a gold kick and not a penalty for a corner kick mother not a penalty Yeah, I'm not too sure if it does strike John terry it hits him right on the nose How they can complain on appeal for that? I just don't know but sometimes you might get it. You never know This is five live bringing you extra time from lisbon portugal and england one one corner to portugal And it's headed on there in the edge of the six yard box headed away by phil neville Drops the deco deco crosses into the box Campbell with a header down beckham needs to get there beckham does get there Well done skipper and he hits it over the halfway line Michael oan is the only england player chasing after it and he had to give up in the end because nuno valente Had an easy header back to his goalkeeper ricardo They looked out They looked out. Yeah, both sets of players looked starting they can't build from the back because they've got four attackers to mark So it's got to be hurry clearances. It's got to be wall slashes when they can get balls into midfield players as they're doing now Then they can pass it, but they don't haven't passed it well in this period. That was pure from lampard, but hard grease wins it back but not england class holder heads in their hands as the referee are smart whistles again and gives another free kick against england It's taken and played to the left to maniche and i ru costa inside the center circle He should be quite fresh ru costa looks for samarro another as the substitution is made by scolari samarro Up to the edge of the england penalty just across in maniche was there good header away by terry And it's taken up by lampard oan's down the lap for cells through the middle the pass is short And to hargree's now it's on to michael oan back to hargree's on the halfway line hargree's loose forward and falls over and that was no free kick Now it's forward and postiga hits it to the right and taken up by young ronaldo ronaldo midway inside the england half dives why why isn't he booked for that? Fill level clears anyway high towards michael oan headed away by carvalho Here's ronaldo again. Now fill level gets in a fair challenge once more, but it's back with deco Seven and a half minutes gone halfway through the first period of extra time here on five live Samal 25 yards. I comes forward runs into david backham then it's starved back where he costa And he dives and that's surely should be a yellow car. That was new lugoma is actually who died But i mean that's ridiculous. I wonder if referee is going to caution new lugomas when the ball goes out of play but uh No, that's that would unbelievable simulation there unbelievable But he should have won a free kick and book a plan Uh carvalho for portugal Uh to deco ronaldo's ahead of him deco's looking further forward though And that's a great ball struck to the left towards samal taken on his chest gary neville's in there The pass in though towards the edge of the penalty new lugomas the back heals the ball taken up by rui costa He's tackled fairly tackled by lampard rui costa those towards the ball Gives it to samal samal edge of the penalty inside the penalty Should slow that was a shot and go rebounds to deco deco with a drive into the penalty area An england body blocks it and lampard plays it away to hargree Hargree's looking for the run of michael oan the girass for sell plays the ball between them and it's headed back By a combination of andrade and caballo to ricardo That's all in that's all england can do when they get the ball at the back is to hoof it forward because they're under pressure at the back There's no spare men when they do play it forward. It's got to be the right ball for oan and basel, but unfortunately it's not been so far Portugal looked more constructive of the two teams an extra time He's money shall the halfway line finding deco once more down the right He's such a great first 90 minutes deco back to maniche And then new neville anti is available down this near flight the portuguese left He overheats it and then he brings back him down. That's a free kick Free kick to england You just got just worry, you know that I don't want to accuse the referee of that Leaning to one side, but you do get the feeling that he would he would yellow card an england player for that tackle And doesn't yellow card the portuguese player? Well, you know, you know, go may just threw himself to the ground as well That was worthy of a yellow card in its own In uifren fever trying to clamp down this but that was just unbelievably blatant gary neville's free kick hit towards versal versal Went down far too easily balls out of play after as for sell throwing to portugal And here's maniche who still looks right. He doesn't Maniche coming forward towards the halfway line now inside the center circle plays it to ronaldo down the portuguese right Cole dives in and wins the ball and it actually came off ronaldo The linesman gave the throw in towards portugal and ursmash says no, that's an england throwing well once again the referee and the linesman fall out about this one and You know, it's good for it as well. Just to slow it down a little bit actually Cole I would say and michael owen of any of the two best players Here's phil neville after the throw in to owen owen brings it down well good play michael owen Bringing gary neville into the game up to the halfway line neville beckham Is captain is ahead of him, but it's in the brother phil and now lampard better from england lampard midway inside the portuguese half Finds owen hargree's hargree's cross deep looking for the header of beckham beckham on a half chance there head of white Yes, nunna valenti was all over the shop It was a good ball from owen hargree's from the left wing with his right foot cutting towards the far post beckham came in Owen was underneath it as well beckham's header Well, he guided it down, but just past ricardo's left hand post. It was a difficult chance if anything else, but there was a half chance He got the feeling it was a header back across goal that might have got in Well, I think owen and nunna valenti were coming back on the back and he couldn't really have a clear sight at it But he did hit it down but off target. No silver goal as yet We've got four minutes left in the first period of extra time. We might need to fool 30 minutes, but here's somehow for portugal somehow Dixon into the penalty. He's a jesmerine costa brilliant block by camber costa goes there He should block by terry and terry was hurt there But it's taken away by hargree's and again There's a huge gap between the england midfield and the two england strikers hargree's plays it to the right owen keeps it in play and then he plays it off the Portuguese left back nunna valenti And that's as well as owen could have done a new circumstances He'd be very well in england He'd be very well chasing the ball out to the touch line and the welter recover Beckham's throwing to diraspa's self for the right of the penalty here owens inside the box It's played back. Here's a chance hargree's should have run to meet the ball didn't wait for it to come to him Ronaldo stepped in next year deception and portugal have it back Well played Ronaldo finding deco maniche Ronaldo again deco once more Three minutes left in the first period of extra time deco gave the ball away there and then clattered into Hargree's and it's going to be a throw into england I bet you never thought you'd see deco in the right back position there Well, he's playing more right back now than right back field He's in the right hand side midfield and having to drop back when he can but they're still adventurous from the portugese And it's sometimes slipping to a 4-4-2 now The adventure's gone to a certain degree, but when they do attack they do get a lot of bodies forward Lampard tackle and foul free kick england Two and a half minutes Of the first 15 minutes of extra time left for play here And the free kick is what eight yards inside The portugese half and portugal have brought everybody back for this free kick, which is going to be struck by phil neville Whereas beckham gary neville sank it back in the cap you get further forward david Phil neville to deliver and cambels up inside the penalty. Yeah, so to his terry Neville plays the free kick in camble tries to head it down half cleared beckham collects Beckham suspicious of a handball still throws the cross in again might fold it on on the far side and does fold the michael oan two minutes Left in the first period of extra time Only put england in front a long time ago into lampard lampard is there lampard shoots blocked still might fold the lampard Lampard is it back to terry england press here for what might be a winner Gary neville crosses into the penalty and not a great cross by gary neville Headed clear coal is there coal wins it back and plays it to terry And terry all the way back to david james and we've got 90 seconds left of the first period of extra time You're seeing a five live on the bbc one one beckham heads it on for sell rushes after it good defending by carvalho Carvalho runs it towards the left touch line beckham is there hustling him harrying him Oh carvalho cleverly plays it away to nunna valente and the clearance towards the halfway line phil neville five Unquestionably the play continues terry gives the ball the hargree's better much better from england hargree's to phil neville One minute to go to halftime an extra time gary neville back to phil neville and neville As squirts it forward beckham heads it on headed away seem to be another farla on beckham by nunna valente Lampard can't collect that and here come portugal again rui costa looking for rinaldo rinaldo's first touch wasn't great Ashley coe hustling him towards the right flag and coal dies in great tackle from the arstal fold back has to continue The throwing though was a fantastic tackle once again a very quick great lampark given the ball away The ball going through to the ball going through to rinaldo on the inside line every kick no It was a great tackle by coe it's a throwing Deco tried to fool the referee on the linesman It's only a throw and deco to take it mere seconds left At the end of the first period of extra time the throw goes towards rinaldo It was intercepted there by hargree's and hargree's clear and i'll tell you what we didn't even get the 15 minutes There's the half time but we're solved in extra time and we've got at least 15 more minutes and who knows after that Well, i was pleased actually with the effort from england's towards the end the last five minutes of that first half Of extra time that first period england were very much on top and uh, you know Create one or two reasonable chances the beckham had a coming in at the far post Both sets of players look dead on their feet But they've got to summon up the reserves from somewhere because after this game the winners of this match Have got a six day rest before the semi-final. I think that was a brave 15 minutes from england Far better frankly than i was hoping for So michael are you ready? Almost Almost I wonder whether we can just get a quick word with graham taylor because the players although they are start They are supposed to restart straight away. They're having some refreshment And graham, what do you think? Well from england's point of view the last three or four minutes it shows that you can control it You can pose a threat. I have to say this looking at the portuguese side in possession You know, they're playing 244 they push on and deco out of possession They're into a 4 4 2 but certainly in possession. You've got a 244 in international football. It's amazing No times change Well, david beckham's out on his knees has been a lot of Stuff talked about his fitness level at the end of the season with ray on the drip So portugal will Start this final period of extra time Remember there's never been a silver goal yet to decide a european championship game It's been golden goals Before and of course portugal went out of euro 2000 to a golden goal a penalty scored by zidane in the semi-final There was all sorts of Acrimony at the end of that game One one after 90 minutes still one one after the first 50 minutes of extra time and the ball is with munich Of portugal england improved in that period but now they have to mark tighter than this It's nuno gomez of portugal nuno gomez towards postiga who kicks fresh air And ashley coal now being urged to clear but showing good composure And eventually slides the ball to oin hargreys near side the field the england left hargreys having problems getting going here Against deco and no linemen's given a throw into portugal Throw in to the portuguese taken already and it's ruy costa of portugal Plays the ball in towards the edge of the area a good step over and a turn there by nuno england need to clear this ball Now there's only they've got messele no in ahead if hargreys can chip it accurately looking for the sell kavaios there gulky But ricardo's out they almost make a mess of that between them And ricardo's still out of his area and then thumps it back into the england hargreys gets good distance on that It's ronaldo against ashley coal Ashley coal gets the better of ronaldo as he has done for large parts of this evening There's a portuguese player nuno gomez lying injured at the moment Scolari what's the game to stop but oin hargreys unaware of that and in fact it wasn't a great ball from him anyway to michael oin and now the game Can't stop if nuno gomez needs attention But I don't want to tempt fate here, but england have looked they've come out and they've looked reasonably strong in extra time so far Until having nuno gomez run the edge of the box He turned to the defenders and shot and it was filled never with a crunch and tackle on the edge of the box And there was one of those ones where Nuno gomez is feeling the pain because he followed through and their fill never was very strong He's uh, gomez is pretty hurt remember the last time england were in a quarter final in this tournament They eventually won through on penalties against spain and here come portugal once more with ronaldo nearside the field ashley coal just backing off ronaldo's going to try and get a cross in ashley coal's got the ball off him ashley coal having a Monumental game the referee's given a free kick to england interestingly in the 90 minutes by the way As far as possession was concerned Portugal 65 percent england 35 percent Yeah, but i mean how many chances did portugal really great? They had all the ball they had the crossers coming in good defensive from england And then one one bread and butter ball into the box and england slack on the marking and it's a goal england must hope that the portuguese have burnt themselves out here with their Second half assault as david james takes a free kick and it's now with viselle over on the far side of the field This is the england right. He's getting nowhere though viselle We lost that rather easily and portugal to the unmarked nuno gomez now in the center circle Portugal building down this near side the field Deco now playing at right back Their most creative player of course deco taking harle greaves with him ball played back to ruy costa Ruie costa edge of the area shapes to shoot doesn't get it in now finds ronaldo down the right hand side and ronaldo's One of corner kick off ashley coal and portugal have come out and started this second and final period of extra time well And they're going to throw cavio the defender forward and the corner kick will be taken by ruie costa Cavio goes forward. There are half a dozen portuguese players now in the area um Already three minutes have added time gone extra time that andrari makes a late run into the area In goes across head he goes and scrambled over the line clean up the live ashley coal has the goal be given The game continues england have to Really concentrate and maybe now counterattack Derias for cell going the long way around ashley coals just cleared off the line Michael oh in all and is no need support from midfield. He's got david beckham there. It's a poor ball eventually beckham is Fed by lampard and now i'm in harle greaves can england having almost gone a goal behind harle greaves ball in towards the cell Is cleared by portugal? We've had drama at both ends here cambal thought he'd scored a winner Ashley coals scrambling the ball off the line when portugal seems certain to score now ruie costa is going forward once more Costa england can't get the ball off it Ruie costa the man who terrorized england in einhoven four years ago Lashes the ball past david james. He never never saw it the game will continue But that could be silver silver for portugal And a big dark cloud for england here in the stadium of light. It's portugal two england one Well, if there was one man with a mission it was ruie costa I think he started the tournament bit left out by scolari come on as a bit part player in one of two games after that He's a bit part player He's bigger he's bigger than a bit part player now because he may have won the match for portugal and got them through to the semi-finals They're celebrating on the far side ruie costa with a real point to prove it's his second goal in the tournament And what a crucial goal that is england waiting to restart portugal still celebrating on the far side We still have 10 minutes of this game to go But portugal have come from behind here To lead by two goals to one ruie costa may have scored We'll have to wait and see the first silver goal winner in a european championship game ruie costa who ran the show four years ago When portugal came from behind then to pull back two goals to beat england three two It's all down to england now. There's no ruini. There's no jerrard. There's no skulls to lift them lampard inside the center circle Finding philip neville And now oin hargreys goes down the line near side the field in goes across the cell has it snatched away from him in the air Lampard doesn't control it first time and portugal will clear lampards going in again And portugal now have grown in strength and confidence with that ruie costa goal and here now comes Ronaldo down the near side of the field two one to portugal But we will have at least nine minutes that Goal will decide it if it stays like this at the end of the 30 minutes of extra time Ball played in by ronaldo and cleared by sol cambell can england find some effort from somewhere here Remember against scolari in the world cup quarterfinal michael oin gave england the lead And brazil came back to beat them two one Andrade's header as england failed to find michael oin cleared by maniche Sol cambell waits for it to come to him and then finds Ashley coal coal is kicked in the head by christiano rinaldo the boot was very high england have a free kick and here now It's graham taylor really is the time for very big hearts now, isn't it? It's a body blow although, you know if we're being very very fair portugal They've taken the game to england for most of this game is absolutely superb goal by ruie costa Hargreaves cost is headed weekly by david beckham And ricardo decides to make a hollywood safe Holes onto the ball and will take all the time that ursmile will allow him But really ricardo has not had to do A great deal compared to david james in this game. He was beaten after three minutes by michael oin portugal have come back and portugal are heading for the semifinal unless england can find a goal now in the last seven minutes of this game gary neville of england head her forward england need to grow again as beckham has the ball and finds oin He's played it behind him though hargreaves makes a gallop oin on the edge of the area trying to thread a way through David beckham now to the far side of the field gary neville's chance to cross the ball on the edge of the penalty area Now neville needs to get this one in and lampard can't reach it beckham will go in and it's taken away from beckham by the portuguese What he's a defender now deco And portugal dangerously coming on the account on the counter attack once more with the man of the hour ruie costa The ball with postiga who got the first goal england now stretched as ruie costa plays the ball down the left hand side the field shot driven in and james decides to shadow it past the post and It's a goal kick to england And we have just six and a half minutes left of this quarterfinal So ashley cole struggling as well. He's got a couple of knots from From tackles on rinaldo. He's struggling in the left back area. He has a lot of very very time in and they even got to take chances and get the ball forward For erickson and scolar at the moment in a quarterfinal It's deja vu as phillip neville now tries to give michael oen something to feed off oen forced to come wide takes the defender cavallo with him oen Managing to give it back to hargree's england have to do something quickly beckham to cole ashley cole phillip neville trying to sidestep and now john terry coming forward time running out for england terry's got gerry neville in space the portuguese crowd of booing incomes across takes a deflection england have a corner A chance for david beckham to plant something in with accuracy here a chance for camberl and terry to come forward with under six minutes to go The england supporters as they have done throughout the tournament Giving wonderful vocal support gerry neville who's never scored a goal for england is inside the area in goes across terries head Has equalized for england Lampard scores the most important goal of his life maybe And the silver goal from rui costa is no more silver We have four minutes to go and lampard who scored england's first goal at that end against france All those days ago has given ericsson a lifeline and maybe it won't be deja vu after all against scolari Well, that was a great quarter from the right hand side from david beckham england had six players in the box It was hung to the far post john terry got up Head of the ball down to front lampard lampard with his back to his goal Controlled the ball with his left foot spot 180 degrees and fired it into the back of the head the portuguese appeal for offside No doubt about it onside great goal. What drama the last few minutes have gone now Oh, frankly, frankly england need to concentrate now high hose silver lining and all that here Lampard has equalized dramatically. What a game this has been what a game if you're not really connected emotionally With either of these sides and what a tournament My goodness gracious and now he's still got about what four or five minutes of the match left Do you know what this reminds me of it reminds me an awful lot of the game in steddy end same score line 2 2 Of course Campbell goal this allowed as well. Campbell goal disallowed Fortunately, david beckham hasn't been sent off and england may need him to take a penalty in a few minutes time Of course, all that goal does now from lampard. It doesn't win the game for england But it might save it for them and we may move to the lottery of a penalty shootout It's england 2 portugal 2 On five live what a night in lisbon as a goalkeeper was off his line and actually cole saw it and despite the fact that he's injured Smashed it from about 50 yards And what are you pointing at? Boy the fill nevel's gone to left back now actually cole's really struggling england need to grow again and hang in there again This time michael owing doesn't chase the ball inside the portuguese half A real stunner for the portuguese fans now and the england fans They never gave up there. They were giving the team fantastic support And we've got three and a half minutes to go still three and a half minutes for another Silver goal to win this game 2 2 ball centre circle here from graham taylor in a moment, but we may be heading inevitably Towards penalties once more that was graham taylor's prediction this morning by the way But this game would be decided by penalties david beckham for england now one long ball into the area over the defender michael owing's there rickardo Uses his head and actually uses his head quite effectively Cavalos had a great game of the back for portugal gives it back to rickardo who alan green Said her in the commentary is a penalty specialist What he may need to be here tonight Long ball into the england half gathered in by gary neville. There's still time for england now To make sure we don't need penalties gary neville's got beckham on the right hand side doesn't really find him though muno valentes there against beckham Beckham's looking for a free kick leinsman gives the goal kick and here's graham taylor Mike if I was to say anything now it would take away from what he's happening on this pitch I think the quicker we get back to you so we can So we can tell the listeners exactly what he's happening because this is a fantastic game And it's a fantastic finish Whichever way it goes now for england They can hold their heads up here as portugal now breakthrough and cambells there Terry butchers said to me before the game the one thing that the fans will not forgive this evening Is if england go out of this tournament meek and marley like they did In japan two years ago, but now england have to really really concentrate with two minutes to go and portugal have a corner Over on the far side of the field. This is their left hand side in goes the corner kick. Oh james Doesn't get his hand to it and the ball will break to portugal again down the right They've still got those players forward in goes across skimmed away by actually cold beckham completes the clearance We're in the last two minutes The last two minutes of Extra time and it's portugal once more ruy costus ball in new no go mays all try and turn The england haven't cleared it yet hargress and of course if this was being played under the old rules Four years ago portugal would have won the game now with the golden goal But they haven't and it's for sell now all it is Always been brought down by cavallo from behind on the edge of the area The angle is wide and awkward here for david beckham But now With how long to go a minute and 10 seconds to go Can david beckham? england's icon can he Can he Do something magical here when he did deliver the ball for the corner for the equalizer the second Goal for england from frank lampard. It was a wonderful ball into the box Sol camels going up there john terries in the box as well with mike cullo and derice mesel Lampard's going in there again. Could this be fairy tale stuff here? It's a great great opportunity just left of the penalty area 19 yards out This will be possibly the last kick of the game and of course the momentum is now with england portugal thought they'd won the match And david beckham takes his time will he go all the way here? Or will he try and find someone in the area beckham's ball is headed away to the far side of the field John terries appealing for the corner kick and the referee's given it We've got 25 seconds 25 seconds of this game We are 25 seconds away from a penalty shootout here in lisbon Not again you say here comes david beckham's corner kick gary neville. I repeat has never scored a goal for england He's in the area in goes a corner kick ricardo gets one hand to the ball Lampard will chase ursmire's looked at his watch. We've got three seconds to go And ursmire blows for the final time and england Who experienced penalties and the world cup semi-final of 1990? the european championships twice in 96 And lastly in the world cup of 98 Their future in this tournament once again rest with a penalty shootout And the good news is i'm describing the portuguese penalty Let me just tell you the procedure for choosing which goal it's all down to the referee in the end They give the referee the the option of tossing a coin if you like heads to the right tails to the left But the referee can say because i've had a look at the rules the one of the penalty spots It's a bit too many divots around it. It'll be too hard for the Taker to keep his his feet They look actually from here graham pretty similar So i think they're going to toss the coin We should just tell the people at home Of course at three of england's penalty takers if you like at the start of play are off the field runy Gerard and skulls so that leaves oan beckham and lampard and you reckon verselen hargrews Is that your my guessing for verselen hargrews? That's the two and i would Guess that will take them yeah graham taylor has said all day that england would win on penalties Just to give you hope wherever you are at home if you're driving i would stop pull over onto the hard shoulder Whatever happens we have to congratulate england for coming back because when ruicosta scored It was like punching a balloon. You know it felt like it was all over Yeah, i mean they've come back great and we've got to really congratulate bolting because you know portugal go down so early But they kept coming on they kept coming on and i have to say this i have admiration for scolari I think i've been talking to you about this i'm looking at his substitutions He's you know at that he's got them spot on again really but hasn't he thrown forward and you know As i say they came and played a two four four at times, but looking at them now You know looking at the two squads of players It really is a question sort of who is the this is where the goalkeeper becomes the hero And that's part of the reason it would be very good for david james to become the hero usabio hero of the 1966 World cup as far as portugal concern when they lost to england and semi finals He's been talking to ricardo england won at this stage euro 96 against spain. They lost italy and 90 semis terry Give us an idea from that knight in turein. What goes on at this stage before penalties? Well, i was substituted before the end so i never had the chance to ball a different penalty Not that i would but uh, what what's the chat like? What are people saying? What's happening? What you're doing is just as a as a as a sub or as a player or as a coach of manager You're going around your players and saying, you know calling us third again You've won it had a chance to win the match before when you think about sir alfranzio when he said, you know You've won the world cup and i've got no going with it again And they've had the opportunities It's just about confidence england of england of 1 1 and lost 3 of shoo ties portugal have never been in this situation And in a major competition. Well, let's let's pick it up as they would say Using the vernacular for david james if he's if he's a bit iffy at some crosses There's nothing wrong with his shot stopping graham. That's that's a very good shot stopper He's a very good shot stop having said that they say that ricardo is this penalty expert So we're gonna wait and say we'll find out very shortly. It really is now mark about keeping you Sol camel has just gone over and hug david james How ironic the sol camel thought he'd won the game as he thought he'd won the game against argentina in france 98 As we hear the national anthem sung from the fans away to our right And the players are just dousing themselves Sleucing themselves down with water there the subs are having a word with them I would imagine some of those situations are so nervous. You actually don't really want to talk to anybody Do you particularly you get your mind in order? I think all of the time But you know without getting me too clever about it this term visualization is so important now You know when these people when they walk from that This would be my view and has been my view with with players all of the time on penalty shootouts When you walk from that halfway line, you must visualize that ball in the net You see it. You are going to score Mike very important. Mike in and can you just remind everybody what you said at the beginning of the program about I can't remember what you said Mike whether they were going to they were going to blast them or place them bearing in mind The state of the pitch Well, the the theory was this morning that it's best to try and place them and not to take a run and blast them Because the rounds a little unsure a little uneven around and also the further on down the road we get with the penalties The more the surface will become a problem The portuguese are in a huddle scolari is in there giving them a rousing speech I can see him punching the air with both fists Svenja and ericsson much calmer But we have seen him a lot more animated in the second half and you pointed that out You wonder whether that was a direct result of what had happened that den shizoko when he was criticized for not being animated Yeah, we've seen him come up onto that line and we did say well I wonder if this is now a manager learning about what the english public expects sometimes, you know, and if so that's good That's fine Now that I can see ersmile saying to the captains if it lands this side this end that side that end He is pointing away to our left He's pointing away to our left. That is the end in which frank lampard's just equalized now. Ersmire Is oh hang on is it best of three? I think it's best of three Well, he's tossed the coin again. He's caught it this time Oh, right. So one one was about who takes the kick and one was about which end okay Now we're getting there as uh, Mike said he Mike England will do the portugal kicks and allen green is going to do the england kicks This is not good for anyone's heart This really isn't like england is it england taking the first one. Let's go to allen green Well, it's all in mike's mind, you know, he just thinks he's totally jinxed with penalty kicks He's not really putting much pressure on me to get us through I think he will take the first penalty and I think it will be david beckham Who will take the penalty? Ricardo is certainly making his way To the end to our left behind which there's a massive portuguese fans And beckham is just on the edge of the center circle at the moment Ersmire making his way towards the penalty here. Oh, it's an age for these things to happen But it will be beckham first All right, we do remember how he scuffed it in his stand bowl but put that mind put that out of your mind david Beckham the england skipper Is going to take the first penalty kick And ricardo is trying to psych him out of this. He hasn't made it to his goal line yet He's now glaring at beckham. Do me a favor referee do your job Get ricardo onto the line beckham's not looking at him Beckham places the ball on the spot Beckham to put england in front in the penalty shootout ricardo on his line here comes beckham. Oh, it's awful It's over the crossbar. It's simply awful I think david beckham looked at the pitch there of a much too sure definitely wasn't the slip of the wire as there was In yes, there was a definite movement there His left foot went down alongside the ball It was too close to the ball and his right foot then slipped as he struck the ball And it went miles over the crossbar Which is exactly what we were saying before the game but now deco European champions league winner with porto After david beckham's miss. It was a touch of the Roberto Baggio's deco can give portugal the psychological advantage one he can get a ball that is But david james david beckham having missed Another david now can redeem all that and send us back to nil nil once more Deco with all the portuguese fans behind david james goal Trying to steady himself for one play you were thought was guaranteed to score for england was david beckham He has failed now. What can deco do? He's going to run at this sport from about 10 yards Davy james is there and deco sends him the wrong way and portugal are what in front? A simple penalty really just there on the run up david james thought he's going to go to his right It was right footed david james went to the right the ball went to the left in the back of the net a simple penalty No, didn't blast it just passed it into the net one nil portugal Michael oan is next My own has a pretty indifferent record to put it mildly for libra pool from the penalty spot He has to get this one really This to put a little bit of pressure on the portuguese and michael oan like johnny wilkinson is sort of trumping down the area Around the penalty spot Ricardo in advance of his line now he retreats on Stairs of the goal looks at the referee has to score michael and he does score Right in the center of the goal as ricardo went to the left. It's one one, but remember Portugal still have a spot keeping reserve. Yeah, I think that penalty spot is quite loose isn't it? It's not particularly Very heavy or very secure penalty spot, but that was right down the middle kept low from michael oan ricardo went to his left No doubt about in the back of the net one one portugal still have the advantage And this is schemao who made such a big difference when he came on as a substitute He replaces the divot. It's going to get increasingly hard to take these penalties Simao, of course playing in his home stadium the benfica player If david james can save or simao misses then it's all square again Simao for portugal and scores a little shuffle Getting james to commit himself and then putting it in the corner and portugal lead on penalties 2-1 Well for the first time ever a portuguese team is in a penalty shootout But you would think that they've mastered them or many before that because they're very cool cool penalty from beco Cool penalty from simao went up a little stutter david james went to his left the ball flew to his right no doubt about it 2-1 portugal So it's not like frank lampard of chelsea in england uh lampard like michael oan before him tries to trample down in this penalty spot The portugese have all their arms linked england just staring on hoping lampard to bring it level again and lampard drills it like going into the center of the goal It's back to 2-2 but once more Portugal have a spot kick in reserve Yeah, no doubt about the penalty frank lampard came up smashed it right down the middle of all about a foot off the ground Good power ricardo went to his left couldn't quite match stick out his right boots and knock it away Well, they've got some very gifted technicians at portugal and this is one of their real stars ruy costa man who changed the game Here this evening coming on to Score what portugal at the time thought was a silver goal But now can david james make a save and if he does it's back to equality again ruy costa against David james doesn't have to make the save he makes a signal to ruy costa And it's 2-2 and both sides have two penalties left Well, the hero becomes the villain ruy costa got the second goal for portugal ever He thought was the match winner Bring the equalize through lampard he came over the penalty David james went to his left the ball went to his right but miles over the crossbar John terry is next up for england Now don't even look john at ricardo. Where's the ball by the way? Get the ball back from the crowd behind ricardo's goal terry has it now Just focus where those blinkers decide what you want to do and do it ricardo knows he no longer has the advantage Each side have missed one penalty This to put england the least for the moment in front short run up for terry and terry hits it into the net carefully carefully into the net And england lead 3-2. Well, no doubt about that. That was a very confident penalty from john terry went back about three steps Distroed up and smashed it down the middle high never going to go over the crossbar Went about six feet high in the back of the net ricardo went right advantage england 3-2 For the first time england in front in the penalty shootout and john terry following instructions went for the placement Cristiano Ronaldo now bounces on the spot to try and flatten all the divots. It's manchester united here against Manchester City Ronaldo must score for portugal Otherwise they're under great pressure and he does and again He shapes to take it pulls out of it knocks it in second time pass james. It's 3-3 And now england must put this one away a good penalty He just went up to a two or three pace run up stop just before the ball saw david james Push put his weight on the both feet couldn't get to the ball hard to his right hand side 3-3 All in hard greaves will take the fifth penalty for england The sides level at the moment They've each got to take a minimum of five remember And this is hard greaves taking england's fifth It is really shocking, you know that this is the venue for the final And the penalty spot isn't flat Hard greaves making absolutely sure ricardo is actually back in his net at the moment Hard greaves replaces the ball once more Now he looks at the portuguese goalkeeper gamesmanship from ricardo He's like pointing that he thinks that the ball's not on the spot. This is merely to put off hard greaves Ersmire is happy hard greaves has waited concentrate and it's into the net well done Ricardo didn't even move beautifully placed to the left of the portuguese goalkeeper at england lead 5-4 Well, no doubt about that great penalty ricardo didn't even dive stood rooted to the spot left hand power place everything else advantage england 4-3 This is pressure. This is maniche And he has to score or england will be in the semi-final of euro 2004 In euro 96 at wembley in the quarterfinal. It was Nadal of spain Who missed the england fans can do no more but sing their hearts up away to our right maniche against david james Everything hinges on this kick here goes maniche and scores and it's 4-4 Well a wonderful penalty the pressure was really on there if he missed Portugal were out but david james went to his left There was a lovely struggle right foot shot to the right hand side of david james So maniche is left in the back of the net perfect penalty 4-4 6-0 6 interactive will follow the bud half past two in the morning Uh the penalty kicks continue Ashley Cole while he finished the game limping But he's obviously got the heart And he will take this penalty kick This to make it 5-4 to england After six england penalties Once more the familiar routine Stamping down in that penalty spot. He's gonna hit it left foot it Cole hasn't looked at ricardo. He looks at the referee here. He comes and Cole scores for england Ricardo went left the ball went to his right and Cole celebrates englander in front A wonderful penalty from Ashley Cole left footed. He just strode up four or five places back ricardo went to his left and he placed it to his right Is this postiga yep Held a postiga at top them has scored one goal in this quarterfinal Will the postman Ring twice here. He's got one goal posti If he puts this one wide if james makes the save Then englander in the semifinal this is excruciating the england players link arms on the center circle It's posture against james postiga must score here. He goes and he sends james the wrong way with a little dink That was called as a cucumber And it's five all what a bit of bottle that was that was an unbelievable. That was like a freak penalty Don't know the referees what the referee's saying. Yeah, he's probably congratulating. He's an unbelievable penalty Just digged it david james went right and the ball hardly crossed the line. It was like panenka Panenka for checkers to back yet when the checks beat the germans in the 1976 final deras for salavastem villa I'm sure he hoped it didn't reach this stage This is england's seventh penalty The scores level at the moment five five usavia was screaming Encouragement to ricardo the goalkeeper vasal about to hit it right foot it Here he comes deras for sal shoots and it's saying Ricciardo just diving low to his left pushed it behind It really was too close to the goalkeeper and he didn't need to make that greatest save vasalas missed That was a comfortable save To his left low to his left hand side. It wasn't in the corner for deras vasal When he came up he struck it struck it pretty hard, but ricciardo guessed right and just put it around the post And so the pendulum swings once more in the penalty shootout and uh The goalkeeper is going to take the new no valente. I thought was going to take The penalty but ricciardo himself the portuguese goalkeeper can send the hosts into the semi final of euro 2004 and sending Ricciardo And for the fourth time in five penalty shootouts england missed out they had opportunities there To put the game beyond reach but portugal responded And what can you say ricciardo is submerged underneath portuguese bodies away to the left David james angrily kicks the ball away the england players go into a huddle of consolation Inside the center circle. They could have done no more But ricciardo the goalkeeper From portugal has beaten james the goalkeeper of england england are out and portugal move on Well, if there's any honor in defeat this is it a fantastic effort a fantastic match It's a pity it had to be decided on penalties and they went all the way to the seventh penalty taker Incredible effort from england great game to watch Swung into end portugal besieged england in the second I've got the equalizer england thought they had a good goal a winning goal this and I went to exit time Two great goals an extra time a magnificent match england for portugal all the way It's just heartbreaking again that england fail on the penalty stage four out of five. It's just unbelievable But I really feel blizzard the plays have done everything asked of them and more Graham taylor would just look at the winning penalty again Not even zidane could have bettered that for the accuracy of where ricciardo the goalkeeper put it I think did he actually save the penalty before without his gloves on I hadn't noticed I didn't know if people say He took his gloves off to save it. We saw you save you screaming at them from I think he was telling him to stand still You know, which is what sometimes goalkeepers go so early and a lot of england's Penalties went in the middle and so you saw this great you so You save you so telling his keeper to stand still Stephen gerald is putting a consoling arm around the rice for sale We must be absolutely distraught at what's happened at the england players have gone over to thank their supporters While the portuguese not surprisingly celebrating in front of their fans, you know, deras extremely well from being his manager How will he take this it's going to be very very difficult for him I mean I said to you at the start that he takes the penalties for villa And I was hoping to see him in the first five Once I hadn't seen him in that I think I discussed with you. He doesn't want to take one And that just disturbed me a little bit because he does take them for villa But he's a very very sensitive boy and this will hurt him tremendously You save you the great hero of portuguese football Has just been congratulating The present hero of portuguese football ricardo. I think you save you as in floods of tears He's clasping a white towel to his face as we can see pictures of england fans are in tears It's been that sort of evening. It's been the most extraordinary game of football It has been thrilling and exciting and ultimately as happens so often grab It seems as if england are on the wrong end of it. I'm totally sick I'm totally gutted because I honestly thought and I know I said look it will go to penalties now It's easy to be boasting but what I did say england will win I was convinced it was going to be a very very tight game But I really thought this was the time england would take it to on penalties now having said that It's very difficult to say this at this moment But this is the job to do to look at the game in that 120 minutes one has to say that portugal had the better of that 120 minutes But that's it. They came back it comes to penalties. We're out And what else can I say? Just a picture of uh, louis philippe scolari congratulating his goalkeeper It's very interesting looking at the slow motion replay of the penalties You can definitely see the urb has been kicked up whenever the penalty taker puts his standing foot next to the spot near the ball That's it seems to what happened to david beckham who's missed three penalties in a row now for industry tours They all looked at their standing thing there and players wanted to get that right and obviously, you know People will bear on that on the actual penalty shootout itself First time goes on. They'll be looking more. There'll be more analysis of the game itself You know how it went how it was it possible for it to go to penalties? I think that's where it comes in at the moment It's impossible to do that because of all the emotion the host country for portugal they're through I mean what a night this is going we're not going to be able to move in lisbon for probably all of them Night scolari has had a portuguese flag in his right hand a brazilian flag in his left hand He is brazilian of course He's classed them both to his chest as if to say you know they're inside me side by side Can we just talk about the game very briefly because england appeared to be as an attacking force completely neutered by the injury to wain rooney Yeah, I mean the thing is the way that portugal played You we always fancied that england would catch them on the break and with a rooney in there We would have done so we would have had better opportunities We would have been able to complete them But having said that he's gone off and what what what I would say for scolari and I've said it before I look at the man. I see how he handled the brazilian situation. I look at his substitutions What is he doing and I tell you what he got this right he got this spot on for his country Was there anything else that england could have done do you think after the rooney injury to try and Reinvigorate get some momentum back into their attacking play I think it was very very important that they got closer to their to their front two and you know The the the balls up to the front two were coming from the back of the team the back four or the back side of the team Where really if you're going to get a good service in The ball has to come from the middle part of the pitch And we were not able to do that. We were pegged back in so much that when we did get the ball We were trying to find our front then from too far away And that made it very difficult for them because we desperately needed the ball in the portuguese half To hold it up by our front people so that we could link in but we were trying to find them from too far away Mark Wright and 606 interactive will be out shortly 0 500 9 0 9 6 9 3 I'm sure you've got plenty to say about what's happened here this evening england are out of euro 2004 They have lost 6 5 on penalties after a 2 2 draw at after extra time after a 1 1 draw after 90 minutes The portuguese still celebrating away to our left most of the england fans not surprisingly have headed towards the exits There's still a few flags of st George looking rather limp as they hang over the barriers and the front row of the various tears here as we just try Tears is really quite an appropriate word, isn't it as we just try and soak it all in And it's it's I really feel for drasper cell as you do because you know He just joined the list of of waddle and south gate and pierce and you know, we know chris wadley works with us on five live and People still talk about it now They talk about it even inadvertently somebody sort of mentions a penalty and they sort of can't help but look at chris And it's slightly snigger never goes away I've never taken a penalty for england But I've been the manager of a side that was one they love and lost to one and taken a great deal of criticism for it Life has to go on I mean if I see dorayas, he's got to learn very very quickly Yet the penalty is missed, but it's not the end of your footballing life It's not the end of your life and you've got to have some character and something to to handle it It's going to be very very difficult for him because it will stick with him for the rest of his life And it doesn't matter whether even people remind him about it It's there and it's how he handles it and copes with it to say he's very sensitive How much is this an opportunity missed from england's point of view in terms of going all the way and winning something? Big opportunity. I mean once again, it's not me just saying it for now You know the conversations that we've had I was convinced that if england got through this game They would go and win the tournament, but I was also convinced that this was their hardest game I never thought that they would have a harder game than this if they could get the top side of portugal I was very convinced that they would go through But I always thought it was going to be much tighter than some of the people probably back home Realized it was going to be this win that portugal had over spain And it's been so much that they've shifted this nation so much I've been coming in and out flying in and out for the england games then going back and doing work in london So I've been able to pick up the feelings And I was concerned because I never felt that back home it was we were really totally aware of what that win for spain did for this nation Terry, you know exactly what they're going through you felt it in the changing room in Turin 14 years ago What will be being said in there at the moment if anything at all it would be complete silence You don't really comprehend what's happened. You know you've played a game of football 120 minutes You play well in the game. It's gone end to end staff has been a fantastic advert for football And if you've drawn the game 2 2 you've lost on penalty some have taken penalty some haven't taken penalties There'll be a lot of players there that will be in tears There'll be a lot of players there that feel that they've let the country down And feel that they let the teammates down and the families down It's an awful awful feeling and looking at the stadium now it takes me back to Euro 96 And when I know how the Spanish were feeling now after the quarter final in the london penalties then because Spain played very well in that match if you remember and then lost on penalties and it's a sick feeling You say what is the best way to To to to come to a solution in a game like this. I think this is the best way It's the only way and when you're the loser it's the most awful feeling in the world That does take you guys to get over but when you're the winner You know you move on to the next match The cheer is for Ricardo Cavallo who's been named the man of the match Let me tell you six six six interactive in about five minutes time 0500 909 693 I think it's only fair to Darius Vasell Mark to say that there was two penalties missed, you know, I mean it isn't throwing it on to david beckham But to have a start where the penalty is missed doesn't help So I think in fairness because it will all come, you know Darius Vasell missing the penalty because we were level again But you know there's a couple of penalties have been Darius's was saved David's was missed he lost his footing, but I think it is only fair to mention I wouldn't want it all to be thrown on to to Darius It's got to be a shared job and knowing david beckham as I do I think he will make sure that it's shared portugal against sweden or holland in the semi-final terry Well, we always look back at this night and think what might have been and I'm talking about the wane rooney injury Because that seems such a several moment as far as england were concerned Yeah, it was and it was as grand quite rightly says it was one-way traffic really with portugal attack attack attack I didn't really create any chances and possibly until the goal But they always had the pressure we said we knew how they play we knew with the wide man, etc I said to but you just felt that second goal If when it was scored if it was scored by england then england would have won the match But it was just a final ball up to the strikers in england just couldn't get out and then with four attackers I mean I mean scolari did ever so well. He put four attackers on he sometimes played two four four Generally with a three and a three in midfield and four up and it was very bold It was very it's england then couldn't get out because they couldn't get out They were forced back and in the end one cross comes in one Mistake in marking one slight error and it's in the back of the net and then you've got extra time by putting the Well an extra time I thought that they looked fit They did well Had the hammer blow of the ruicosta second goal but still came back after that so buckets buckets of energy buckets of heart From the england team but when you lose and in penalties, you know It's I mean if you've been there, you know what it's like if you haven't been there You'll never know but I tell you what is the worst worst feeling in the world It's not a nice way to lose a football game Well, I remember coming out of wembley after your own 96 having been there as a punter and I felt you know I felt the worst I've ever felt at any sporting event. I mean It was so cruel on the england team. Let me ask you When this leaves england going forward with with players like david beckham were 29 and gary neville who are 29 and so forth David james, you know, what is he now 33? Where does this leave england going? This is the biggest test for all of us because I just like to remind people of 1988 When all three european games were lost under bobby There was a great thing let him get out six years in the job get him out pretty well a similar squad There were changes but a similar squad then went in only two years later and reached the semifinal of the world cup What is now a immense disappointment? No decisions at all, but I have to say I hope this manager and this squad of players do stay together Certainly for the next two years. I'm not going back on what I've said. We've got this tournament with a world cup with 2008 This is a period of time when this squad is at its best is peaking. Don't let's just break it up and throw it about now Let's learn from the bobby robson era where we kept it together Sure and terry I think the difference between tonight and the day that we were together in shizoka is that england was so limp In that second half the people really did feel aggrieved didn't they that england hadn't given it everything They won't go away from this ground feeling that if apart from any other reason the way they came back at equalised with five minutes to go Will they they won't feel let down if you were they're not going to feel like that Well, the players will the players will feel that they let the country down Sure, but the supporters aren't going to feel like they have no the supporters won't feel that at all and you know You say well if there's bags of effort and commitment from england which there was today buckets of heart And like I said an energy and they had a real good go at them and yes You lose on penalty for seventh penalty that each side takes his is his gut wrenching It was great point from graene taylor the average age of the squad and it's about 25 If you looking at 27 28 average ages of teams that go on and win tournaments That's what you need and I've always said this is probably a tournament too early. It's world cup 2006 That's here from span, of course We had one nil and one one and they scored two one in extra time and we're coming back in extra time. That's fantastic then unfortunately we lost on penalties and That's uh That's very hard There were times when we looked like we were playing against 12 men and one was swiss Well, I don't want to comment that but We were not we were not lucky with Some things out there today, but that's football unfortunately. What did you make of that? This allowed goal the camel goal? Well from the bench it looked all right and I haven't seen it on on tv so I can't comment it but it looks all right, but the referee said it was It was a push and He decides the one thing we did see tonight was english spirit. You must be delighted with that Yeah, the spirit has been fantastic and I can't I have no complaints at all about Anything I mean The play has been fantastic the atmosphere has been fantastic all All the way through and the only thing we're losing in this way is Very hard. Thanks for talking to us. Thank you Garth crooks with a very target question about the referee there Terry, thank you very much indeed. We'll hear from more from Terry butchers throughout the tournament Anna green and my kingdom of course as well. He looked he looked completely shell shocked and who can blame him and we've said He's been a lucky manager tonight. He's not ran out. Yes, it did It ran out for him and for the and for the england boys But as I say you've got to get through all of these kind of things and then rethink no hasty decisions Let's think it through and then look back and learn from this experience and hopefully Make this squad a stronger and better squad for the next tournament And the one thing for the next one we've got about 20 seconds left We have discovered a very special talent in Wayne Rooney. I think we all knew about him anyway Definitely. Thank you very much indeed Graham The ground is pretty well empty now. We're getting our breath back after an extraordinary evening's football Of course france against greece tomorrow join us for that in the hose alvalade down the road Let's hope it matches up to the excitement here this evening. Here's 606 with mark bright This week on the bbc A drama like no other is that point? Bone shaking thrills backhand reply Heart stopping shots defending champion is out at the first hurdle he's fallen lightning fast action 126 miles per hour bizarre grunting noises And unbearable timmy tension Tim henman, this is match point Wimbledon 2004 on bbc tv bbc.co.uk and bbc radio five live Five live when we talk you listen Women in particular they do that sort of flapping thing like their walruses, you know, do you know that they've got flippers as though the Emotion is so much that they're liable to explode and when you talk we listen This remarking old man's a regular fan the thing that bugs me more Are the guys who don't watch football who come into the pub to try it on with the aforementioned women Speak your mind on the uk's home of live news and live sport five live Approach very very aggressive. Do you think that's the way england should go about it this evening? Well, I think that ironically their hand was forced against croatia and um They had to respond and they duly did i'm not looking for them to go a goal behind this evening, but Certainly it um it it pulled them around and um, they were left with no other alternative And it was very much in the end a kind of all-action premiership style The only trouble with all-action premiership style though as you can see girls as well Graham taylor good evening Graham again They seem very happy playing that way They didn't they because it perhaps is more in their nature their second nature Would you be unhappy to see them as being as as offensive this evening? I think it will all depend who Who takes the the best approach to it in that respect because I can see portugal doing the same I can't see portugal actually Starting as a slow fashion either And if both teams want to sort of go we can look forward to quite a sort of fast rate in that first 20 minutes How much does momentum count for in international football? Well, I think in any game it counts if you you know, you're into that run and you you feel good and you you feel confident And the results are there It doesn't really matter at all the thing about international football You can get the momentum in the tournaments that that's the most important thing You can't it's very hard to get the momentum in international football Otherwise because there's like six to eight weeks before every game But here in a tournament if you get that going then you can really be in business My kingdom has got some some news for us mic Well, it is the expected england lineup and I think Two crucial players in particular will be the fallbacks gary neville and ashley coal because They'll be looking after we hope the alternating wingers louis figo and cristiano ronaldo Now the let me give you the lineup just in case you're under it's david james gary neville John terry sol camel and ashley coal david beckham steven gerrard frank lampard paul skulls wane rooney and michael oin now portugal have five of the Porto players who won the champions league and three of them in particular trio in midfield i think a keymen costinia maniche and deco and england Can't allow deco to run right here. They have to get tight on them. I'll be interested to see what they do about that And interestingly talking about evolution mark only Five of these players played in the first game remember new no gomez comes in for the suspended pauleta And they've also changed three of the original back four from the first game and since they did that They haven't conceded a goal in the two games. Shall I just run through their side? It's ricardo miguel carriero Andrape, nuno valente the left back costinia maniche figo deco rinaldo and the one player coming in nuno gomez Let me just ask you might what you think portugal might do about wane rooney Will there be any possibility? Can you see of maybe a man-to-man marking job or is that unlikely? Well, i'm amazed that he hasn't been marked in the in the first three games and they do have players I mean, I think if they've been going to do that they might have brought pati in because that's his speciality the fact that they're Still going to go in with costina and And maniche maybe they're not going to but they'll you know, they'll have to be much tighter on and then either creo Escher or switzerland one Well, let's get a portuguese point of view then with kickoff round about in an hour's time Let's join our reporter here at the assadio deluge nijal adley Well mark downstairs here at the assadio deluge It's time to get a portuguese perspective on tonight's game with benedino barrage from a portuguese radio And benedino we're all excited at home in england. How excited is portugal being the past few days? Of course, that it's a lot of excitement here in portugal as you as you have already known and seen It's a difficult game between two beautiful teams For me and in my perspective, I haven't seen yet The true england, I suppose because the two first games that I have seen and the last one I don't I don't have the chance to do it to my to my radio station But I have seen the two first games and I think that england was not yet Obliged yeah to uh perform well. Nevertheless today, I suppose that it's a rough game But I suppose that it's a very tight game. I don't have any idea who is going to win or not Don't ask me for that for a for a for a for a Who is going to win? I suppose that both teams have chances. They have strong points. They have weak points But uh, portugal it's prepared for it. And is this Figo's final chance? For Figo it is for Fernando Cotto also for ricosta also for many of these Wonderful players that they are finishing this career. It's uh, it's it's it's it's it's the last chance I suppose that they have also the understanding for that So it's time to catch the last opportunity one final question. Are the portuguese scared of wane rune? I don't know we must ask for the players and you know with the answer because yesterday They told on the press conference that they are not afraid with especially with rune but all the team For me my understanding. It's that I am scared about rune not about oan and you know it for me the through oan It's not appeared yet in the euro 2004. I don't see the michael oan But i'm seeing rune. I see i'm seeing a great lampard the schools I'm seeing Beckham on spaces when it is necessary Is is uh, is playing but I suppose that we have a very very very strong team I'd like to wish you good luck, but I can't neither do I That's Nigel Adley in the bowels of the stadium here graham tater the way they play Portugal with just one up front and certainly and i've seen two of their three games live They struggle to get a lot of players in the penalty area playing that way Yeah, which surprises me a little bit because there is some natural attacking players And certainly deco would would get into the box you'd imagine and so that's a little bit of a surprise Just listening there to that interview about rune. I mean what's going to interest me is that andrade and carvalho The two centre backs of Portugal they're very quick. They're very strong And I think it's going to be quite a Battle in there the interesting to see if either one of them is prepared to step out onto Runi or when he when he drops off or leave it to the midfield to To take care of so you think it might be a situation where it just depends maybe where runi is on the field Whether one of those two Takes him or whether they might leave it to to to manisha or costinha Oh, it would be more like costinha because maniche will get but maniche has come in and as micking and was saying earlier The side is the portuguese side has evolved and maniche is now in here and could score goals from from midfield That is one thing that he can certainly do so when runi comes off It will either be a question of either one of the centre backs coming into him or leaving it to costinha The point i'm making the two centre backs of Portugal they're strong and they're very very quick We've talked about the way that and we're going to go to winmelden in a second the way that the portugal line up with Is 4 3 3 it does mean of course they have the ability to counter attack very quickly And as we've been talking about how aggressive and offensive england were against croatia If you as fen is that something that you would drum into the players Look, I know perhaps the way that they played against croatia is the way you want to play But just be very aware of the counter attack with the way that portugal is set up I think what happens now with the england team he will of course make them aware And they will be aware of how portugal play but i have this feeling that there'll be as much if not more talk About how you're going to beat portugal Mike, uh the counter attack is that a way that you can see a portugal perhaps approaching this match? Well the biggest part i'm just hoping that england have grown up in the four years since they last met portugal in the I just remember that game in particular in eindhoven And england were just outnumbered all the time in midfield. This is why i come back to these particular three Um, I was talking to esparan heroics and yesterday and he said it is a difficult system to play against It's it's a little similar to the brazilian system. The two guys that grand's been talking about costinia and maniche sort of Sit in front of that back four. I know maniche does get forward, but then that allows the likes of That allows figo and deco and ronaldo to do their stuff and they of course will try and support nuno germas They're not a team full of goals though, but I just worry that england will go for long Particularly if they're sloppy again with their work in midfield They've got to keep the ball and uh, they don't keep the ball then They'll they'll have long periods chasing it and it's still quite warm here mark as well tonight I just got a flash on the screen a few moments ago 29 degrees And uh 50 humidity that's not she's oka two years ago, but it's still going to be quite warm and it will take its toll There's certainly been a muggy day here today in the portuguese capital More football chat to come of course 745 full commentary on your five live five live your euro 2004 station
