 I don't think Michael Owen is as quick as he was six years ago when I when he first burst onto the England Well, that's still doesn't answer question about why is off the ball running isn't good as I wish Well, I saw a comment to Derby to him about the fact that he's having had these injuries and getting the muscle bulk Continually working on it to get that right. What I also think you see in your what's Liverpool play and the Gerard diagonal ball over the top Bro and you see that I think he needs a service from closer into him from that midfield the ball not always so long where you play it through a little bit you go I go back to the rush situation and rush was quick and sharp but I tell you what it was played in for him diagonally from the midfield from his own half He doesn't get that much kind of service then I think you'll find the runs by coming off that last defender Alan from your experience of when Chardonnay played Liverpool do you think as Alan Green does that he maybe just have lost a yard of pace Well, no, what I think has happened is it was obviously a bit like you know, you were talking about Wayne Rooney He's still an unknown quantity for a lot of defenders even at this even at this tournament and I think Michael Owen everyone's very aware of Michael So back fours drop off a little bit deeper. He has to come deeper as well to try and get into the game I can tell you one thing if he scores tonight, it'd be it'd be a yard quicker all around the park and it doesn't matter I'm looking at two area on three warming up here now and he's doing all the things he normally does but he hasn't scored And I'm sure if he scores tonight he's never an extra yard, an extra spring in his step so confidence is a major factor No matter how well how we think about players now good they are confidence is a major factor and as a forward you need some goals and Michael needs a goal And Alan from your perspective when you have somebody like Owen who scores so many goals you really don't drop him do you under any circumstances Well no I think he's earned the right to stay on the side but when Graham was talking about he's all around game now I noticed certainly against the Swiss he got the ball in the box and he was taken on defender and checked back onto his right foot And there was no power in the shot as if he was really wasn't confident about it It was a similar position where Rooney scored when he hit the post and come back and hit the keeper and he was confident when he when he checked inside to get his shot off And Michael wasn't so as I keep saying it is a confidence thing I think and the only way then forwards they can run around They can do a lot more work off the ball they can get a tackle and they can put pressure on defenders but the one thing that's going to give Michael a lift is a goal Alan Kurbisch and the Charter Managers are summariser at Switzerland France in Cormbo this evening we'll keep you up to date here on 5 Live from Lisbon on that game If you want commentary on it then it is on our sister station 5 Live Sports Extra Kickoff 20 minutes away here in the Estadio de Luz the England players still out there just a few shafts of sunlight across the field Most of the Croatians are back inside now Damien Gramatikus is in Lisbon he's on the river front there's a big screen there and plenty of fans who don't have tickets We'll be watching it there good evening Damien Good evening we reckon about 40,000 fans at least in the stadium and many of those who are not in the stadium gathering here at the fan park on the river front There's a big screen up there's a mini football tournament there's penalty shootouts I've got a couple of them with me Alex first of all what's your feeling about tonight I think we're going to win 4-1 actually tonight I think we're going to do really well I think it's going to be a great game and I think we're going to put a few passes to be honest That's a pretty confident prediction it is and my mates have laughed at me at the prediction but I've got money on it so I'm just hoping that we're going to win Amy you're here too what do you think? Well I think of course we're going to win but I have put my little Euro in for one all because that's all they left me Now we were just hearing about Michael Owen you had some thoughts about that what do you think about Michael Owen? Oh Michael Owen yeah he's alright that's all I have to say about him really You're not sure he should be in the side? Well I think he's you know he was good in this time but I think he's faded a bit and they're just clenching onto him Right well thank you very very much enjoy the game we will be bringing you more from here at half time but for now fans a couple of hundred of them already in front of the big screen More arriving as we speak back to you Staying in Gramaticus on the riverfront here in Lisbon where lots of England fans this evening will be casting their minds back to Shell where four years ago England need just a draw against Romania to qualify for the second stage And they failed the parallels with tonight's match are unavoidable for England captain David Beckham It's going to be an interesting game because obviously you know they need to come at us from the start because they need to win the game we only need to draw it But you know we're not coming into this game thinking we'll take it easy we'll get the draw because we can't afford to do that We've been in this position before a lot of the players here where we've only needed to draw a game to go through to the next stages and we've lost So you know we're well aware of what they can do and well aware of the physical part of it as well but you know we're not worried we're not worried about their team but we're not becoming complacent where we're too relaxed about them Do you think it helps that four years ago against Romania you actually lost the game so didn't go through do you think you can draw from that experience I think it helps because of the memories the memories weren't nice at that time you know we beat Germany and everyone was up and expected us to go through to the next stages without us even worrying about Romania And unfortunately they came out and they scored a goal in the last couple of minutes so you know we can take a lot from the memories because I personally wouldn't want that to happen again That's David Beckham with Charlotte Nicol the parallels are there Graham Taylor and when you have an awful experience in football it does drive you on doesn't it just try your darn hardest to make sure it's not repeated Well you don't want to repeat it again the problem is of course if you think about it it can get into you and it's very difficult you know to put it completely out of your mind but that's what you have to do this is so important I mean at this level particularly it is much a mental thing you know when you get it to this kind of level all of it has got to be your mind thoughts have got to be positive they've got to be looking at things But these fellas are human beings they're like anybody else and so there will be times when little bits of doubt creep in but the last thing you want to be doing is really thinking about what happened in the past because it's finished it's gone It's also completely different England I'm talking in terms now of a sort of tactical managerial setup Kevin Keegan who was very hard on your sleeve over the top come on boys and everything perhaps not a great tactician where Sven particularly because of all that time in Seria are there's one thing he does know about a tactic would you go along with that well not totally no I have to defend Kevin here because I think that's something that has been thrown at him sometimes quite irresponsibly yes you can always make a point for it But I mean in many respects I think that's a little bit you get labeled I've been labeled everybody gets labeled in that sense I think that's a bit sometimes on Kevin Yeah but I mean players will label managers anything particularly if you don't win I mean you go along with that part of the game what I do think that Sven has bought he has bought that calmness there's no doubt I mean what Sven goes out of his way to make sure doesn't happen that there is no argument Didn't I mean we're not going to have any break up and he's been able to get by this continuity of selection by making sure that there's no no splits in this squad he's been able to bring a calming influence in there and there's no doubt about it That the some of the present to England players that is helpful that's helped them come out and it's helped them express themselves Well it's only 15 minutes till kickoff but I have to say there are a lot of empty seats still around the England and if I can call it the England then it seems to be because they're all England fans are way to our right There are huge great swades of empty seats on the top of the three tiers and some of the England fans are taking the opportunity to lay out their flags we can see half the white eagle the emblem of Ben Fieker on the far side from us There are a lot of empty seats there the empty seats directly opposite the probably nice corporate seats because over the half way line they're probably having a gin and tonic and we'll nick in late on The Croatians are way to our left and those red and white check shirts they've taken up if we can call it their allocation most of their allocation and they're making plenty of noise but I know it was very hard for a lot of people to get in the other day for the France match And maybe still people trying to get in through the security systems and so forth but still plenty of empty seats here kickoff under 15 minutes away on your five live your European football championship station Here's Dalia Raphael with the news Live

606 from 10 o'clock tonight Good evening from Mark Pugatch and the Estelle de Luge in Lisbon The players are all off the field in the changing rooms now Just getting ready for kickoff in over 10 minutes time Other sports to use today, the opening day at Wimbledon, Roger Federer beat Alex Bogdanovich in straight sets Other winners today, Venus Williams, Layton Hewitt, Gorin Ibn-Izovich and Martina Naratilova Wimbledon Football Club will be no more in a few days time They'll be known as the Milton Keynes-Don's, the Football League say they can make the change And Andy Fintoff and Marcus Truscophic are doubtful for the opening one there in the Triangular Series against New Zealand Just a reminder of the teams then, here's Alan Green England have the 1-11, so it's the favourite starting 11 James the goalkeeper, defenders Neville Terry, Campbell and Cole, Midfield, the skipper Beckham, Gerard Lampard Goals, strikers Owen and Rune, Rune's got 2 goals, Owen who's yet to score but will score, trust me At Croatia, their goalkeeper is Petina, remember Petikoza who was their number 1 goalkeeper He was injured before the tournament started I think they're going to play a 4 at the back, Simic on the right, Robert Kobac, Siminich in the middle And then Zivkovic on the left side, the former postman player, who told he's the one who's going to be deputized to look after Beckham Tudor, very experienced player from the event, he will sit in front of that back four and then you've got three Rosso on the right, Rapache on the left and Nikko Kobac in the centre and the two strikers, Perso and Sokota Andy and Brown can give us team news on Switzerland, France and Coimbra Well the French are regarded as being as strong as they possibly can be and that does not include der Saïe or Gallus They've been left out of the side as have the court and will tour as they make four changes Coming back in, Sagna right back, Lizarazu at left back, Makalely into midfield And Pirae supporting of course the other attack minded players, Zidane, Henri and Trezegue As for Switzerland who can still qualify if they win this game, Haas is suspended On show of Liverpool comes in at right back and it's a new look forward line for them Fry suspended pending further discussions about his alleged spitting at Steven Gerard And also left out the veteran Chapeussard, so they have the 18 year old Van Lantan and the 22 year old Geekax Leading their forward line here against France The photographers have rushed to the mouth of the tunnel, they're standing on those black platforms That means that the teams won't be long now, they'll be down in the tunnel soon Group B then, France four points, England three, Croatia two, Switzerland one All four still in with a shout, France and England both need just to draw Terry Butcher, England captain at the World Cup, 1990-70 final Terry we saw Portugal start with a terrific tempo last night Would you like England to start with that same sort of tempo this evening? Well start with a better tempo than Spain did, I mean Spain I thought were very poor, very slack I think they were worried and more nervous about the situation Portugal just went for it and they went for a right from the word go Didn't get the breaks or the chances early on They were allowed to have one right on the stroke of half time But their attitude I felt, one of them the crowd, the crowd got behind them And there's obviously a very very big, very large dominant England crowd here today So if England can do that I wouldn't say go hell for leather because you might leave yourselves wide open But at least be positive and keep the ball What I want to see England do, the full backs get on the ball Make passes, England retain the ball better than they have done in the two matches And people say well it was a better performance in some degrees against France They still failed to keep the ball when it really mattered against France But if you're an England player now Terry and you're in a position of only needing a point Would you say to your teammates, forget about that Think about it as if you need a win Well I wouldn't worry about the points at all, I wouldn't even mention the points Just the fact that you have to go out there and beat them We know, everybody knows if England beat Croatia during the quarter-finals Simple as that, I think at the end of the day The only time you ever think about possibly settling for a point is probably the last five or ten minutes Or fifteen minutes when you say right, they've thrown things at us, we know what we can do Let's really shore up the ship and make sure that they can't get through Whether England can do that I'm not too sure But if England were to go ahead in this match Then there's a much much better position than having to chase the match as Spain did last night Well it is extraordinary bearing in mind how many England fans are in town That we still have these huge suites of empty seats around this ground, granted It's surprising isn't it, we're just expecting them to fill in Because it is difficult to get into this ground I thought well by the time the kickoff comes these will be full But we have a couple of quite a number of seats really That haven't been filled But if possible there are even more flags in the work of the opening two games As if every village, every town, every nook and cranny of perfidious Albion as they once described Is here and that is a testament to the support that England have brought over here Which on the whole and we must say this and be responsible on the whole has been extremely good natured And there are plenty of families here and women And if there's anything a football fan that needs women and children There's a civilising influence on them Yes it is and it's very good to see them all But if we even then just put that to one side now and look into that dressing room Those players are coming out, the manager's coming out It's coming into what they know It's a knockout situation almost as well Before it really becomes the real knockout But these players will be coming out in here And in their minds they know what they've got to do And as I've said earlier if seven or eight of them get on their games And they hit it mentally and physically Don't worry Mark, we'll be okay You've used this before you've said this to me I find that very interesting from a managerial point of view You know you're not going to get 11 out of 11 You reckon seven or eight out of 11 should do you a job most of the time I'll tell you that's what happens It is very very rare for 11 players Let's say this day in age 14 players To be physically and mentally at their top You're very lucky, very very lucky if that happens So you look for seven or eight and they carry the other three And it may change from game to game And I think that's what's happened with England We may just have carried Mike Lohan for a couple of games Today may be his game, let's hope it is And that's how you forge a team spirit How you forge a team You look after your mates when they're not having such a good time We've mentioned a lot the yellow card to Wayne Rooney We should just reiterate for people at home Maybe you're coming home from work and you're stuck in traffic Or wherever you are or you're out running in an errand We hope you're enjoying our coverage and you stay with us David James is on a yellow card of course After giving away a penalty against France Paul Scholes is on a yellow card and Frank Lampard as well You can see the England team now Pierre Luigi Collina just puts his hand on O in shoulder England in red this evening England in red this evening I know those shirts have sold well at home And that's what they will be wearing this evening The flag of St George carried by eight local Lisbon children That is being held in front of us in the right hand half as we sit And the Croatian flag in the left hand half And still these empty seats An awful lot of empty seats away to our right Over on the far side and just a little pocket away to our left In the middle of the Croatians And then there's basically the segregation between the England fans And the Croatian fans the goal to our left Whereas Zidane scored those goals That is basically being put into effect by flags So we keep our fingers crossed Still a pretty good atmosphere Not as good as France because of these empty seats Yes I know it does have that There will probably be afterwards some talk about the selling of tickets What I would know now is they come out As far as I'm concerned this is the take off We're into the quarter finals And we're really in and going for it And there's the reception for the teams And the flashbulbs go off And Graham Taylor can't help but just clenches his face As if he was the England manager once again In that technical dugout Is the England players in red just link arms And they've all got a mascot with them each as well Of around about six, seven years of age Something like that As we prepare for the national anthems Before this crucial group B match Well England are not going to lack for vocal support And encouragement this evening here Well some England fans just can't help themselves Whistling and chanting throughout the whole Of the Croatian national anthem As the two teams shake hands The flag bearers depart the maskers Walk off hand in hand in single file And now the two teams shake the hands of the officials Pierluigi Kline, the best referee in the world Indisputably in charge of this match The teams now will assemble for the final photographs England need only a draw Let's see what happens Graham Taylor the former England manager With his Terry Butcher the England captain In the World Cup semi-final 1990 Alan Green and first is our correspondent Mike Ingram So here we are back in the stadium of light On the longest day of the year Eight days after the eventual darkness against France A game I think that's going to define Sven Jorn Erickson In a half years as the England coach A chance to show that England have advanced Since Euro 2000 when they were faced with Exactly the same scenario only to fail England need big performances in particular From three players at their fourth tournaments Beckham, Skoles and Owen They could hardly wish for better support England in red and white this evening With an unchanged line up David James, Gary Neville, John Terry Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole David Beckham, Stephen Gerrard, Frank Lampard Paul Skoles, Wayne Rooney and Michael Lloyd Pierre-Louis G. Collina got as big a cheer As any of the England players when his name was read out To the crowd Croatia have made one change from the side Which held France Bielitzer is replaced by Zivkovich The captain who we think will try and do a Marking job on David Beckham Like he did for Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League When Beckham was with Manchester United Putina and Goal, Simic, Robert Kovac Siminic and Zivkovich Rosso, Tudor, Nico Kovac Rapayich, Perso, Sokota None of those players play in Croatia And they defend us from big clubs AC Milan, Bayern Munich and Juventus And Stuttgart England need a draw Pierre-Louis G. Collina A great referee who refereed England's game Against Argentina of course In Sapporo, England's 5-1 win against Germany In Munich And also referee the game which got England here The goal is draw against Turkey In Istanbul The players being made to wait And now away we go and in this first half England play exactly the way they played In the first half against France From right to left and England need to start well They need to keep the ball Gary Neville, long ball into the Croatia half Headed away before Michael Owen can challenge Croatia predominantly in blue With speckled red England with Steven Gerrard Lift the ball across to Ashley Cole on this near side of the field Cole controls the ball on the chest Tries to lift it towards the Croatian penalty area And it runs away from... Well, the goalkeeper, that must have taken a deflection off a defender Because Putina, who has come into this side In place of the injured Pletikosa Concedes a free kick over on the far side Looking to beckon for the first time against Zivkovic And it's going to be a goal kick to Croatia And here's Terry Butcher for the first time If anything, it's a slight surprise in terms of the Croatian line up Zivkovic has gone into central midfield Tudor has gone at the back to partner Robert Kovac I think Zivkovic is trying to do a marking job on Steven Gerrard But the other line up, the way that Croatia lining up Very similar to England, matching them up 4-4-2 It's the wide men Rosso and Repaich on the left-hand side That can cause England problems But England need to get their full back to the ball as early as possible For the first time Croatia seen as an attacking force With Repaich down the left-hand side of the field Krosic comes into the England area, looking for Rosso Rosso will keep it in by the corner flag, faced by Ashley Cole Who's having a good tournament so far, Cole Croatia find Nikko Kovac, one of the brothers Now Simic, they move it in towards Zivkovic The man, of course, who played unhappily at Portsmouth Repaich can't keep it in over on the far side An interesting little side feature of this group, of course Is we've brothers all over the place We've got Philipp and Gary with the England squad We, of course, had the Jackein brothers of Switzerland And now we've got the Kovac brothers Who were German born, Robert of Bayern Munich And Nikko, who once played for Bayern Munich, of Hertha Boleyn And it's England on the break down the right-hand side of the field Michael Owen going into the penalty area Owen looking to deliver for poor Skoles, headed away by Croatia Good England break there And Skoles has the throw in down this near side of the field Throws the ball back to Cole Fantastic support from the England fans here in Lisbon England looking to lampard on the edge of the area He's thwarted, though Croatia looking to clear, but caught in possession by Skoles Now it's in midfield with Boris Zivkovic And Zivkovic untangles himself Rooney, of course, one of the England players on a yellow card tonight Lampard, Skoles and James being the others Croatia knock a rather aimless ball to the far side of the field It's going to be an England throw The Neville brothers aren't the Blues brothers when it comes to the end of tonight But something encouraging, start from England down the right-hand side Good ball across from Michael Owen Just inches short of reaching for Skoles in the far post Croatia able to clear, but at least England have been in Croatian territory Long ball by Gerard, seeking out David Beckham But Siminic is there inside the penalty area He's going to turn with Beckham, and he turns well as the defender You're listening to Five Live, England nil, Croatia nil And of course, simultaneously we have Switzerland and France playing And Croatia give the ball away, that's normally England's crime It's Gary Neville, England playing with good urgency here The ball in the area towards Skoles, Croatia managed to clear And they clear very hurriedly, up in the air Most of the game so far, inside three minutes being played inside the Croatian half Skoles looking lively, doesn't get the pass right at all if a Lampard But Lampard will stretch effectively and give the ball to Gary Neville Neville onto Steven Gerard Gerard doesn't control it first time though And it runs away from the Liverpool captain and a goal kick for Croatia That's a good positive start from England It's not too bad, just a three and a half minutes, going up to the four minute mark They've looked lively, they've looked sharp They've tried to win the ball back when they've lost it in the Croatian half And they have won it back on quite a number of occasions And trying to feed Owen, trying to feed Rooney, Gerard's looking lively going forward Ashley Cole's at lively, and Gary Neville at lively going forward So I would say all in all, it's been a positive start for England Neither of the Croatian strikers have touched the ball yet, I don't think Perso and Sokota, Sokota of course of Ben Fika, Campbell getting up now with Perso The ball will break to this near side of the field and Giovanni Rosso He's got Perso in the air, it's lifted too high though Gary Neville's headed clearance, David Beckham doesn't control that at all Well over on the far side of the field And then referee Kalina as the two number sevens collide That wasn't great at all from David Beckham, he should have got that one away And here's the danger for England Croatia are particularly good with free kicks and they're set pieces And here's an early test now for David James Free kick to Croatia, far side the field, the left Lots of blue shirts in the penalty area going forward Zivkovic makes a late entry into the area In goes the free kick, Owen Zivkovic shoots and it's turned in even It's turned in in the end for Croatia by Niko Kovac Wow, what do we say about set pieces? England didn't deal with it at all, Zivkovic went in And then Niko Kovac got the rebound And it's a disastrous start for England, the first set piece they've had to deal with And Croatia lead by one goal to nil What I hate to say, but that comes as a result of a David Beckham cock up on the far side It was a ball headed out by Gary Neville David Beckham with a lot more time than he thought Tried to play a left foot pass to Gary Neville Went up in the air, in the end, fouled reply And then came the free kick, six Croatian players in the box England couldn't deal with it, David James in the end made a very good save From a snap shot, not too sure from Croatia and forward But there was Niko Kovac to put in the rebound James no chance, England one nil down It was Zivkovic who had the first effort And the very first set piece that England have had to deal with They conceded a goal and that has been so much of a problem for them Over the last three years, dealing with the free kicks At least England have a lot of time to get back into this game England nil, Croatia one and we haven't yet played six minutes Long ball forward now looking for Michael Owen And of course the Croatians will gain so much confidence From having got that early strike David Beckham made a mess of it The one thing England mustn't do today is concede free kicks In those sorts of positions And Croatia take full advantage And England now are chasing the game Croatia now working its short of the half way line Long ball forward looking for Perso who's given offside And it's a free kick to England while it's a stunner And England at that moment slipped a third place in the group And of course will not qualify if it stays like this Can I tell you what, from the free kick I'm looking at that free kick line, the defensive line Five, six markers there, Mark and Croatia They just drifted right back in on top of David James On the six yard box And if anything, the man who made the contact And there might have been Perso who got the contact That David James saved, actually struck the ball From about seven yards out, which you cannot have England have got to keep out of that back four Sculls takes over from Wayne Rooney Tries to flick it through to Michael Owen The message was loud and clear before this game The ball might break down to Rooney once more And it's a goal kick to the man in yellow Away to our left, Brutina Well it was laid on the line to England going into this game Croatia as they showed particularly against France Very, very dangerous from free kicks Which has been really England's Achilles heel Dealing with corners, I mean so many times We've mentioned this in our commentaries In all the friendly games in particular England very rarely keeping clean sheets And now all the Croatian fans Predominantly away to our left are celebrating But they may be still celebrating too soon And England equaliser here And they will still be on course for the quarterfinals But England have it all to do As now Ashley Cole crosses the half wayline England need to regroup and show some composure They started the game quite well Sculls now looking for Rooney Goes past the first defender Still Rooney onto Sculls in the area Sculls is there, stay by the goalkeeper's legs Brutina, that was a chance for Sculls To score his first goal in three years Beckham now needing to redeem himself in this game Bork sent in from Steven Gerrard to the far post Michael Owen heads it back Rooney has a flash, Sculls has a goal again And Brutina who made an excellent save from Sculls Drops on the loose ball That's what happens when the chance falls to an England player Who's not really high on confidence It was wonderful play from Wayne Rooney Sculls upplayed the ball in field Dead centre about 35 yards out to Rooney He went past two players Dicked the ball into Sculls Who had made the run right to the heart of the Croatian defence And Sculls first time His shot was straight up between his legs And the ball rebounded to safety But it's a good response from England That's much better In particular Rooney getting on the ball And Sculls breaking from that midfield section But England can't defend the way they did They just dropped right back on the David James And they've got to keep out You've got to try and keep as much distance as you can Between the defenders and the goalkeeper At the moment it's Charrois revisited England are going out Trailing 1-0 but they still have 82 minutes of this game left to get out of trouble here Croatia lead through a goal from Nikko Kovac Scored after 5 minutes And you're listening to Sport on 5 BBC Radio 5 Live England unquestionably looks stunned Having conceded that early goal So now who will be joining Rangers Of course next season doesn't control it And of course there are so many top defenders Down there for Croatia This is not going to be easy for England To break down the defence We'll be hearing from Graham Taylor In a moment in fact as the ball is played back To the Croatian keeper Let's bring in Graham Taylor for his first thought Graham In many respects it's a good game to look at Because England have responded well To going a goal down But if there's anything we haven't done You cannot afford to give careless free kicks And that's what resulted after it I think with Sikovic coming in at the back I think he's pushed on to Ashley Cole And the ball has come off Ashley Cole For the reaction save by David James But at the moment the game is very open And it really can go either way But England need to get that goal To get themselves really back into this game Rosso up against Cole Up against Skoles as well Skoles typically Terry Elyte Taking the ball off Rosso And the goal is to get back into the passing groove And in the goal away to our right Of course Beckham could have scored the penalty Which would have made England qualify Now with six points But it was Beckham's mistake which led to the free kick Croatia punishing England And now the goalkeeper butina who's made one Fines save from Skoles And Campbell gets up well against Perso It's a decent response from England having gone a goal behind Lampard comes across Uses his chest well against Rosso Lampard turns Gives the ball back to Cole The game is being played at quite a pace here Stephen Gerard now Fifteen yards inside the Croatia half Going at great pace into the area Falls on the edge of the area Referee Pielo Uigicolina says No foul, no penalty And has a passing word with one of the Croatian defenders Tudor And it's going to be a goal kick to Croatia We played eleven minutes And it's a terrible start here for England Trailing one-nil Yeah it was a great bit of play by Stephen Gerard In terms of going at Tudor When passed the Croatia midfield With great pace he's very quick Running with the ball to Stephen Gerard Faced Tudor right on the edge of the box Pushed the ball past him Knew that he couldn't get the ball on the other side And just went to ground That's why Tudor was signed to Kaleena He should have been booked for simulation But Kaleena as usual got it right Not that they were going to But England can't play for a draw now But at least unlike four years ago They've time to come back When Romania got the winning goal Of course four years ago That was right at the end of the match Croatia now with The Robert Kovac Controlled by Sokota Over on the far side Ripayic against Beckham And it's going to be a throw in to Croatia Fifteen yards or so inside the England half Over on the far side of the field England-nil Croatia won One of the two Kovacs is Nikko Kovac Who's primarily a defensive player In midfield He has scored the goal here Punishing England from a set piece England getting back behind the ball again now As Rosso with the header Heads it straight to David James In the area way to our right Mike, I just think when it comes to a free kick like that England bringing everybody back And that entitles Croatia and other teams To put a lot of men forward into the box And they possibly would do And I think on that occasion Kovac went into the box He probably wasn't designed or Had him worked out that he was going to go into the box But thought, well, there's nobody else to mark I'll just go and take a chance And obviously that paid off Gary Neville now Down the right-hand side for England One-nil to Croatia Gary Neville once more England playing from right to left Having to go back into their own half To John Terry Terry now to Gerard And England need to have a tempo here Steven Gerard rolls it across the halfway line To Lampard Down the centre from Lampard now Rooney receives from Michael Owen No real shape hit though here about England Skoles is the outlet near side the field And this unfamiliar left-sided position Gets it into Lampard Little dink ball from Lampard Trying to find Ashley Cole Cole on the edge of the area Looking again to win a free kick He gets up though quickly to retrieve the ball Cole still has the possession Steps over the ball and finds Lampard Lampard towards Skoles The ball bounces off of the Skoles And then Rooney with his right foot Smashes it wide And the goalkeeper comes charging out of his area To scream at his defenders Yeah, it's a good play down the left-hand side from England And I think Colleen has given the free kick Against poor Skoles on the edge of the box Trying to take it past the defender As a handball But good play by Ashley Cole Deep in the creation back third Good play by Lampard as well Good cross to Skoles on the edge of the box He cut it back on the edge of the box But Skoles was deemed to have just handled the ball But much better from Cole And unlike to see Ashley Cole get forward When the ball's down the left flank And obviously Garineva When the ball's down the opposite flank Terry now jumping with the striker Purso Gerard controls the ball Beckham's drifted in from that far side And now England looking to cross the half-way line Croatia give it away They're not that great in central midfield I have to say Croatia As Gerard now tries to take advantage Rooney almost got that through to Gerard Croatia at full stretch Always dangerous though on the counter-attack Bring the ball to the centre-circle And it's lifted forward by Robert Kovac But it's offside given over on the far side And England have a free kick I mean England have had the bulk of the possession there Terry but they're trailing Well Gerard's got forward particularly well And they are vulnerable to a long ball over the top Croatia they do defend We get her away by Croatia Skoles lifts the ball in Looking for Rooney over on the far side It's a really poor clearance by Croatia Beckham now jumping with the defender It's up in the air It's too high though for Paul Skoles And Croatia will thump it down field Back inside the England half Campbell has to be careful Judges the back pass well And let's get early news of the France-Switzerland game from Ian Brown It's still 0-0 France started well But Zidane misfire from a beautiful pass by Pires The Swiss though have come back into it And there's just been a fine save by Barthes From a free kick by Hakanyaki 0-0 Thank you Ian And Skoles was almost played in Michael Owen then But Tino though read the situation Comes out of goal and clears into the England half Campbell wins the head up England still having the bulk of the possession Lampar to Gary Neville England 0-0 Croatia 1 We played exactly 15 minutes of the first half And you're listening to Sport on 5 Live from the stadium of light in Lisbon Now Ashley Cole for England Croatia inviting England onto them And then looking to counterattack Paul Skoles near side of the field Skoles to Rooney who's gone very deep Rooney trying to find Lampar It was Zivkovich though in the way for Croatia His pass forward though is easily read by Terry And now Beckham needs to impose himself Beckham luckily gets that forward to Rooney Surrounded by Croatian defenders Comes back again to Beckham Driven ball in takes a deflection And the keeper, Poutina, will make a very comfortable save I think all the England midfield players have got going It's that one man, that's David Beckham He seems to be suffering from his mistake Which led to the opening goal from Croatia He's not gone on the ball in good areas He's not wandered in from the field He's just sort of not going through the motions But he's been conspicuous by his absence And England need to look to him to try and get His long passing going, get his movement going Get into good areas where he can cross good balls But at the moment he's not doing that It was such a loose bit of play by the England captain In the first place to concede the free kick And that was punished and handed Croatia the initiative But England over all the better side Skulls now looking to try and release Michael Owen Across comes Tudor, poor clearance by Tudor Owen now needs support, he's got Beckham behind him Defender comes in, Semenic And that's going to be a free kick to England Right on the right, and here's a chance now For David Beckham to atone for his error Because this is a free kick by the corner flag The England right, and here's a chance for Campbell and Terry To go forward to try and get an equaliser But England at the moment, if it stays like this Will not qualify for the quarter-finals It's a free kick to England Beckham to take it And there are about half a dozen red shirts In the penalty area Away to our left Including Terry and including Campbell Owen Lampard of course Who scored from the free kick In goes the free kick for England Headed away by Croatia, Gerard looking to control it On the edge of the area, Beckham's available again Down at right hand side Beckham's ball in to Gary Neville Neville flicks the ball over the defender Croatia will clear And they're having to do quite a bit at the moment Ashley Cole's the only defender back inside the centre circle The ball knocked forward by John Terry Who's now out of position Comes in with a lunging challenge And Perso escapes from England defenders He's got Sokota ahead of him Rapaich coming forward to England Eventually closing down on Perso But that was a dangerous counter-attack As Gerard now looks to Rooney Rooney goes wide to take it around the defenders Gerard says give it back to me And that's how it goes Then he's out of position And has it on the line And the basket is set Beckham's down the centre at the moment Rooney, Owen ahead of him Rooney in to Owen, doesn't come back again to Rooney Lampard can't claim it either And now Croatia Winning a free kick Skull's going in on the goal-scorer Nikko Kovac Skull's has to be careful He's on a yellow card They're going to have a quarter-final as long as they get England into that stage. England are a goal away from being at that stage, but there's a long way to go in this match. England having the bulk of the play, but trailing as David Beckham concedes another free kick over on the far side of the field. Beckham has stayed down as well. He's just speaking to the referee following that challenge. He's up on his feet again. We'll hear from Graham Taylor again in a moment. This free kick is a little further out, fortunately from England's point of view. Sokota and Purso, the danger man. James waits. Free kick is delivered into the area. Campbell challenging, and the end Campbell will knock it out of the area to safety and finally tee it off to Ashley Cole. 19 minutes gone in the first half. England nil Croatia won. Stunning start here for Croatia. Goal up to five minutes. Excellent ball now by Gerard Taruni. Now Beckham down the England right. Gary Nibbles there to help him out. Beckham shuffles in field and picks out the unmarked Lampard inside the centre circle. Lampard to Ashley Cole. England are passing the ball around quite well, but they're trailing. Skoles looking to play a 1-2 with Ashley Cole. Wasn't particularly well returned by Skoles. And it's Nico Kobach, the goal scorer, who concedes a throw-in down this near side of the field. Quickly taken by England. Ashley Cole now into the area looking for either Runi or Owen. Wasn't a great ball in. It was cleared by Croatia. Purso heads it straight back to England. Croatia have given possession back quite easily here, far too easily from their point of view, but they have the lead and it's all down to England. Gerard skims the ball into Runi. Runi back to David Beckham. Beckham on to Lampard. Lampard shoots, doesn't really get hold of it. Bettina makes the save. Graham Taylor. Well, I think England have played well since going down. I think they've been the more positive side. I think they're creating, they must keep playing exactly as they have been doing. And it's interesting to see Beckham has come in off that right-hand side now and again, which I like to see him doing to get himself involved in the game. If he's not getting a service, he's got to come off that right flank and get himself involved. So even though they're 1-0 down at the moment, I don't think we can ask much more of what England are doing. One mistake in 20 minutes. One mistake by England has been punished here, and that's the sort of thing that tends to happen at this level. We'll go to Kwanbra in a minute where the France-Switzerland game is taking place. Just watching England now, looking to try and feed Ashley Cole down this near side of the field, and Cole can't keep it in. Back to Ian Brown in Kwanbra. And it's the man who punished England. Zinedine Zidane has given France the lead after 20 minutes. France won, Switzerland nil, a pires corner, and a header from Zidane with a goalkeeper's steal, and a struggling office line. France won, Switzerland nil. Thank you, Ian. At the moment, then, France and Croatia are going to qualify from this group. France, as the group winners, would play Greece, and Croatia would take on the hosts, Portugal, in the quarterfinals. But we still have another 69 minutes of this game. The ball is with Croatia, with Perso, the striker. England win it back, as they have done pretty well so far. Can't find Rooney. England need better passing than that from midfield. And Croatia now short of the half-way line, with Rosso turning onto Nico Kovac, the goal scorer. Keeps the ball well. And Croatia having rare moments of possession here. Rosso crossed the field, looking for Siminic, headed back to Robert Kovac. Now Croatia step inside the England half, and this is dangerous on the break. Looking for Rappayic. David James comes out, needs to make the save, and he does. And then finds David Beckham over on the far side, the England right. Beckham hits a big long ball into the Croatia half. It won't clear Robert Kovac, though. England need better delivery than that from David Beckham. And it's a throw-in to England over on the far side, as we move towards the half-way point of this disappointing first half now from an England point of view. Lampard goes down, but he hasn't won anything. It's going to be a throw to Croatia. Midway point then of the first half here in Lisbon. England nil, Croatia won. We need a goal from Alan Green from England. Well, there'll be a lot of very worried people listening back home. Beckham's not in the game at all. Lampard only marzly better than Beckham. Here's a free kick taken by Gerard Taruny. Back to Gerard on the far side. He owns inside the D of the penalty area. He has his right-armour lock there, but the pass is shorter. Now it's back to Gerard once more. This time he looks for on, but that wasn't a great ball from Stephen Gerard. Easily intercepted, and it's brought away now. And here's Rosso, the tall muscular Rosso playing right midfield. He's up over the half-way line, and he dinks it forward towards Soccato. And that was well played in the end by John Terry just for half. John Terry just for half-second. Terry, I thought he was going to make a mistake. Now, Devore just sat up nicely for him to head the ball into the left back area and then clear the danger. But it has been grand tell. That's right. It's been all England so far, apart from that one goal. Croatia just coming back into a little bit in terms of their passing. Beckham drops a defender on the far side of the field, and then the defender caught back in there. That was Simunic, and Simunic clears. Gary Neville tried to direct it back towards the Croatian box, but once more Croatia have it then. Soccato doesn't control that. Gerard back to Terry, and here's Paul Scholes drifting into the left flank. Scholes is inside the centre circle, finding Rooney back to Gerard. And now Neville on the far side. Most of the play is inside the Croatian half, but there's no penetration from England. None at all so far in the opening 23 and a half minutes. Gerard comes forward, approaching the penalty area. Hits it in low. Rooney didn't quite anticipate that. It was head away by Tudor, and England have it again. Neville to Beckham, and on to Gerard. Right in the penalty area, and Gerard Cleverty wins the corner. England keeping the ball well, and Croatia have got England's disease when it comes to keeping the ball, and they're giving the ball away to England very, very cheaply. England are getting it back, no incision, but this time, the Beckham's pass have got a corner. Corner for the right. Beckham to take it. Right footed, dinked in high towards Terry, and down by Campbell. Punched clear by Bettina. Gerard shoots goals, takes it a flexion, very on-surely offside. But the flag is kept down anyway. Bettina has the ball. I think he was onside there when the ball came through to him. He looked about five yards offside when the ball came through. Was it Gerard to have the shot there on the edge of the box? But it's better from England's point of view, the chance that they get a corner, get a bit of a chance to get the ball into the box with a good delivery. But you sort of feel that with all this pressure and all this passing, yes, something may come a chance, may come, and they had the chance with goals. Unfortunately for him, it was a good save from Bettina. England losing, France winning, both by a goal to Niel. At the moment, France and Croatia are going through to the quarter-finals in that order. Rapache, whose free-kick delivery led to the creation goal. That's another excellent ball forward. Secata in the middle of the air, gets the shot on target, saved by James. That went a long, long way. Well, not a good understanding between Campbell and Terry. Campbell not covering Terry on the diagonal, and Secata got in behind John Terry. His shot was weak, and luckily straight at David James. But so the warning signs at Eiffelring, as much as they want to push forward, they've got to keep the door closed at the back. Gerard, swings the ball towards the left side. Good pass. Cole brings it down, perhaps a little awkwardly, and it's clear to the halfway line. Campbell plays it forward again. Cole is onside, down the left flank, crosses on the volley into the penalty. Rooney doesn't break it down properly. Might run to back him. No, it's cleared by Zipkiewicz. Either play for England through it. Just the final touch of Rooney. Great cross. Good ball from Campbell. Good cross from Cole into the middle of the air. He run, a penalty spot. Oh, Rooney miscontrolled it. Gerard swings the ball in towards Wayne Rooney. Good header away by Kovac. Forward by Gerard again to Neville. Neville crosses, takes it a flex. Come from Bettina, punches it clear with his right fist. Lampard's after it. He takes it down on his left thigh. Frank Lampard, 15 yards over the halfway line. Back it goes to Sol Campbell. Another goal in Quimbra. John Murray. It's an equaliser for Switzerland. It's Frans van Switzerland won, and it's Johann van Lanten, the 18-year-old with a low shot from just inside the penalty area, past the outstretched leg of Fabian Bates. And Wayne Rooney's record's gone. Johann van Lanten is now the youngest scorer in European Championship Finals history. It's Frans van Switzerland won. So Frans the holder's struggling a little bit, but frankly, who cares if England can't win this game? They're losing the game. They've got to score, England. They have to score. If they don't score, they're out of this competition, but something's coming. I can feel it because the way that momentum's going for England, Croatia looking a bit tired at times, trying to get them in forward, trying to clear the ball, don't clear the ball. England picking it up and pressing it well. We played nearly 27 minutes here on 5-5. England, Neville, Croatia won. Conditions could hardly be better. The temperature's very mild. The pitch is superb and the atmosphere is wonderful. So many England fans inside the stadium. Now there's a foul on Rooney. Come on, David. Thank you very much. We'll take that. Come on, David. Now's an opportunity. Taylor made chance for David Beckham, slightly left of centre. How far out? Almond, 24, 25 yards. If he could place the ball, he'd probably put it on this exact spot. Here's a chance for David Beckham, who's done next to nothing, apart from the ricket that led to the free kick that led to the Croatian goal. But this is a very similar position from which he scored against Greece at Old Trafford. Do you remember that famous draw? I think it's closer. I felt like a win. I think it's closer, David. I think it's closer. 27 and a half minutes gone. England need to get back level here. Croatia got simply everybody back defending in the penalty area. Petina can't see a great deal here. Lots of blue shirts in front of him. Beckham in his red shirt. The England captain. England trailing 1-0. They need inspiration from the skipper. Here comes Beckham, right footed, and he swells it straight into the wall. Beckham heads it back in. No offside fly graze, and it was a weak free kick. That wasn't the best. There was about a six-man wall there, and they're quite big. The Croatians are able to block it. I don't know if they jumped or not. Probably didn't have to. I don't think they had to. Because the ball struck the wall, but great expectation didn't happen. Ball's inside the centre circle with John Terry for England. England trailing Croatia by Goltanel. France the hole is being held by Switzerland. Here's Wayne Rooney. Chipping it forward towards Michael Owen, but ahead is a Liverpool striker. That comes for Tina, and Bright Yellow declaring the ball. It's just not happening for Michael Owen, is it? It's just the balls that either just about a yard, a two yards, two yards, or too long is running through, or it's short. It's just the wrong side of him. It's just not on the same wavelength, but Michael Owen's not on the same wavelength as England players, or just having that little bit of bad luck. But their static defenders, big defenders from Croatia, Michael Owen will get a chance. Here's Rapage, running down the left side. Well played by Gary Neville, getting across, and accepting the intended pass. And it's played back by Neville to David James, and James, all in black tonight. Swirls the clearance up over the halfway line. The Croatian fans might be outnumbered by about four or five to one, but they're making a lot of noise. Wonderfully passionate support for Croatia. And their side is leading 1-0, but here's Gerard for England. Forward to Rooney. Skulls running through the middle. Rooney has a spot at him, plays it to the left. And here's Ashley Cole, the left fullback. It is encouraging that both Cole and Neville are getting into forward positions. Back to Lampard. We've played nearly half an hour here in Lisbon. Gerard onto Lampard. Lampard didn't pick up the pass correctly, and then he fouled the Croatian player. It's a free kick to Croatia. Yep, just trying to play the 1-2 there with Gerard Lampard. The ball just squirting off his leg. Miscontrol, really. And founding Kovac, I think it was for Kylian to get the free kick. But something's going to come. I mean, I just feel the way that it just wave off the wave of England attack. They have one breakthrough, so that they have one breakthrough, one shot on James. But apart from that, it's been one wide traffic for England. But haven't had any penetration, Terry. Apart from Skulls, effort. Yep, but they've had one or two good breaks near the box as well. And Rooney's coming off. Rooney's doing particularly well turning and going at people. I'd like to see them get more midfield players forward if possible. I wish I could show your optimism, but I've got a very bad feeling now about this game. Croatia leading 1-0. Rapajec, we knew how good a delivery he had with his left foot from dead ball situations. Played back now. And here is Robert Kovac and it's head-up field. High beyond Sikota and one bounce, and it's through to David James. And James throws it out quickly to Ashley Cole. We played nearly 31 minutes in the Stade of the Loots and England Trail, Croatia by a goal to 0. It's France, one Switzerland, one in Coimbra. Here's Ashley Cole. Cole into Rooney. Rooney's a long way out. 40 yards out. He tried to play towards Beckham, a particular flexion. And Zivkovich, his position in the centre of midfield is surprised a lot. Should have cleared it. Picked up by Gerard Schultz. Was that deflected? Yes, quarter. Yeah, good to see David. Steven Gerard get hold of the ball. That was a great tackle from Gary Navel in the middle of the park. Gerard just pushed Gary Navel aside to take the ball on. He was about 30 yards out, 25 yards out, slightly right of the centre. Ball deflected for a corner. Beckham's corner from the right. Hit right footed. Deep towards Lampard. Good defensive header away. There must have been some pushing. And it's a free kick to Croatia. Gerard is driving England forward in a way that, notably, David Beckham isn't. Well, he's getting forward and Lampard has won that sitting. I still like, when the ball goes out to the full backs, I'd like both midfield players, Beckham and Schultz, to break forward. Try and take the midfield player away. Try and occupy the full backs in our goal. Or Neville can play balls into strikers feet and in particular, Rooney. Graham? Well, Gerard's having a magnificent game. I mean, he really is leading on. But I have to say this, I think England are doing as much as we can expect of them. It's a very open game. But what we do know, Alan, the next goal is going to be vital in this particular match. But he has all the signs that there is going to be another goal. Croatia play it forward, but that's too high for the new Rangers striker, Prisso. And it's a lot of trouble behind for a goal kick to England. We played 32 minutes in Lisbon. And the big video screen away in the far right-hand corner, Croatia won England nil. It's hit high upfield. Michael Owen is there, but can't glance to Hedderhout to Beckham as he should have done. And again, we talked before the game started about the big-name players for England. Beckham's goals, Owen, haven't done it yet. Here's Lampard. Lampard to Beckham. Rooney runs ahead. Beckham keeps the ball. Now he plays it the way in Rooney. Down the right flank. Rooney drills the ball in low towards Lampard. Well cleared. Beckham picks it up. Beckham can't do anything with it again. He's having an absolute stinker. The captain needs to get into this game. Never mind his worldwide reputation. What about world-famous form? Here's Rooney into the penalty here. Rooney pulls it back. It's headed behind for a corner. Owen was waiting. Well, I'll tell you what, this is Geron. And it's Rooney that's driving England forward. Lampard, I think, is doing particularly well in the middle of the part, netting things together. But Beckham's doing nothing. Owen's doing nothing at the moment. They need a bit of luck if they possibly can. 12 minutes to half-time. England trailing 1-0. Beckham corner. Again from the right. Deep looking for Terry. Terry heads it into the 6-yard buck. But there's some giants there in blue shirts. And there's even a taller man in the goalkeeper, Pratina. And he gathered the ball very easily indeed. He throws it out to the right side in Simic. And it goes. And played on by Perseus. Simic wants more. The right fullback is deep inside England territory now. Back wants more to Perseus. Into Zivkovitsch, the captain of Croatia. Croatia leading 1-0. France won Switzerland one in Queenborough at the moment. France and Croatia go through in that order. It swung upfield, but that's a poor ball by Siminic. And that's how to play for England throwing. They didn't have to be that adventurous at the moment. They didn't have to be. No, but they have to win the match. And remember, one goal can change it. A very similar situation last night. The team that had to win went ahead. The team that only needed a point was behind and trying to force the match. Good play by Lampard. Finding Rooney. Owens ahead of him. Not a great ball from Wayne Rooney. Robert Kovac is there. And here's nice Zivkovitsch. Up towards the halfway line. And he checks. And Gerard beats him. Gerard with the aggression. Finding Skolz. Great possession from Michael Owens. Skolz pass was wretched. Absolutely wretched. Sorry. Not good enough. Well, he tried to dink it. He's dead center. Tried to dink it to Michael Owens. If he just passes it correctly, Michael Owens in, but he overhitted by a mile. Possibly would better to have a shot himself. Throw it in the far side to England. Gary Neville to take it. About 10 minutes left in the first half. Neville throws. Owens is there. Back to Neville. Lampard's available. And he crosses into the penalty. Rooney raises well. Heads it. Goal woods. But in the end, it was a fairly simple save from Pratina. You say about Steven Gerard having a good game. I think Wayne Rooney's having a particularly good game as well. And they're going to cross. Well, they're outstanding in terms of the England performance. Yeah, he got across. Big defender's got a header on target. Unfortunately, never, never, never troubled the goalkeeper. Rosso. Back to the goal scorer, Nico Corbac. And now Rosso wants more. And he hits it across field to Rapajic. And Rapajic flicks it forward. That's got a bounce into the England box. And straight through to David James. James throws it out to Gary Neville. A lot of anxious England fans inside the stadium. Millions more, listing back home. England nail creation one. Neville over the halfway line. Hits it towards the left flank towards Goals. Doesn't get it right. There's a mistake by Rosso. Well done, Ashley Cole, winning it back for England. Cole's also playing quite well. But here's Gerard, who's leading the side at the moment. Beckham's anonymous. Here's Rooney. Rooney with Lampard ahead. And it played it to Frank Lampard. Right to the penalty. And Lampard wins. Oh, he thought it was a corner. Maybe it wasn't in the end. Must have come off at the end. Come off Frank Lampard at the end, rather, to Golcan. I still like both fullbacks to get forward if they can. Whenever Croatia come forward with a ball, they're trying to hit their two strikers and overhitting the pass, not getting any service to the strikers. They just give them possession away. All they're happy to do is just say, right, we're just going to defend this very similar to what England tried to do in certain circumstances against France. But England's fullbacks have got to get further forward. They've got to drive on their midfield players. And sometimes, yeah, sometimes lead two on two at the back, get they feel they have to. But with a covering fullback to make it 3-2, just for safety's sake. But the fullbacks have got to get forward more. We're not the only ones frustrated. There was a shot of Sven Juer and Ericsson with his head in hands. Nine minutes to half time. Croatia lead 1-0. Presso steps away from Cole. He's midway, inside England territory. But then Cole intercepts his pass, intended for Rosso. And here's Scholes, very deep. Still 30 yards short of a half-wayline, Paul Scholes. Finding John Terry. Terry to Beckham. Beckham right in the centre circle. Plays it into that circle. To Scholes. Who's down the left flank now? Ashley Cole is to move forward. But it's going down the right side. To Neville. Neville left by Beckham, taken up by Rooney. Rooney well tackled. Lampard's in there as well. On it goes towards Rooney. And then taken away by Croatia. And they are defending well. Now it's with Sokota. Play to the right side in Presso. Presso back to Nikol Kovac. And Rosso. I think they're gaining in confidence, Gracie, all the time. The PIGE to the right side in Simmits. It's a careful, controlled passing. And then it's dinked into the penalty area. Terry was in trouble there just for a second. He broke away from Sokota. And then almost this time he's jumped. It was clear. Rosso picks it up though. Rosso to Presso. Into the penalty area. Presso on his left foot. Good shot. Good save by James. Very similar sort of situation to where he scored against France. Sooner or later, in the penalty area. Sokota. And now he's got it. And the ball goes to Sokota. Now to Presso. Good save by James in the end. Here comes Beckham. Arore from the England fans. Will the captain do something finally? Looking for Michael Orte. Overhits the pass. And that goes behind for a goal kick. Great defending from Simmits. On the far post. The right back then. Just able to sort of give Michael Orte a little bit of a nudge. It was a good ball from David Beckham. And had the Simmits just been further tucked in towards his centre halves. It would have been the perfect ball. right hand side similar to the goal he got against France this time he didn't bullet the shot past the goalkeeper it was well-signed by David James low down to his left whatever possession England have had all they've had goal woods was a skull shot that was blocked obviously Croatia have scored through Nico Kovac they also had a secotta chance and that Perso shot that was well-saved by David James and they're not attacking really you know David three good chances one of which they've taken England can see another free kick how often we said over the last week is so England mustn't concede free kicks it's far too cheap well even they give away possession they've only they've only had one clean sheet in seven games and that was against the Swiss last week so you know even the do give away sloppy goals that really was a sloppy goal to give away and it's not good at the start of the game after five or six minutes to go one down Rapage crosses from the left-hand side Campbell rises he heads it away lampart heads it down skulls good play finding lampart lampart excellent pass forward Owen better from England Gerard on the halfway line left to the center circle Ashley Cole ever willing takes it up from Stephen Gerard he's acting like the England captain at the moment the proper captain with the arm band is hardly in the game Gerard wants more to lampart towards Owen oh it's outside should school was pretty with a header schools schools is there the score for England the frags they've done and for the first time in over three years Paul schools gets an international goal and England are back level perasure won England won it started with a chair and it's swept through the middle Owen was there really was there and school finished it off I'll tell you where it started from it started from Ashley Cole in the left back area great run down the left hand side stretch the creation right side of that defense good ball inside to Gerard a Gerard just opened himself up with an in step pass into front lampart lampart dig the ball through to Michael Owen the touch was heavy it was well saved by Petina the goalkeeper really headed it go woods and there was goals but I'm tall years but I tell you why he didn't have to stoop to head it because the ball was right on his head and in the back of the net we thought he might have been offside on the far post Elijah and kept his flag down what a sensational goal from Paul schools his first for over three years I don't care if it came off his backside it doesn't matter it doesn't matter and that will make Paul schools feels so good grand Taylor now it was gonna come I mean England's exactly what England deserve from going down to an early goal I think they've shown great character I think they've dominated the game and they thoroughly deserve the equalizer and what they must do now is continue playing the same as they have been for the for the start for all of this half right we've got less than five minutes to half time both games in this group B are level at one one at the moment France lead the group England are in second place I tell you what there is a scenario opening up here and let's not speak too soon but if France are held by Switzerland and England win do we say it pretty for one minute you're worried about England well I tell you what no I'm sorry I'm not gonna change my view I think Beckham is a waste of space out there absolute waste of space this guy has such publicity all around the world when is he going to deliver well I tell you what it's where it's one of those ones Graham Tata felt it so did I feel it as well but it was gonna come something was gonna happen that be careful here England though here's what's all comes from he should and it's well plucked from the air by David James they're gonna be they're gonna see this half out now we've got about four or five minutes towards half time just see it out don't get carried away keep the ball like they have this is the best that England have kept the ball in the tournament this is the best that England have kept the ball for quite some considerable time and thank goodness to fans of something you sing about three minutes to half time here on sport on five on BBC Five Lies goals with the equalizer remember Croatia have to win the game to prevent England going through here's Owen finding the goalscorer skulls now to Beckham good run by Gary Neville but Beckham didn't look to where Neville had run I mean instinctively he should have known that Neville was going to run that way and he didn't and here come Croatia breaking forward so Kota to the left-hand side in Rapajic Rapajic tries across it's blocked well by John Terry and that's taken up by Beckham he's tripped by Rapajic and that's gonna be a free kick to England yep this is when I tell you what the ideal scenario is now that we talk about four skulls not scoring for so many years it'd be nice to have Michael Owen was to get a goal and England with a go in front but they just got to keep their heads now just slow it down a little bit see it out till half time get some wise words from Spaniard Ericsson get your heads clear lads because at the end of the day there's Croatia that have got to come out in the second half and get that second goal for them to win the match for them to go through the way that England applying in that in that first half was excellent I felt going forward kept the ball well didn't make many chances you're right Alan they still kept the ball well and still kept plugging away the heads didn't drop and you know my dearest wishes that David Beckham rams my criticism back down my throat I want to see him succeed I want to see him play like a world-class player England 1-1 with Croatia France 1-1 with Switzerland that's the situation in group B as we approach half time in the two games cold for England finding Gerard who's had a wonderful first half on to skulls into lampire now to Ashley Cole Cole to skulls once more and skulls flicks it back to Sol Campbell who lets it skim off his chest to John Terry and I David Beckham Beckham on to lampire on makes the run lampire spots it and then good hitter down by Michael Ode collected by Gerard on the left side and towards on again on wasn't quite ready for that and it's played away by Tudor taken up well by Cole Gerard back to Cole wasn't the greatest fall back by Stephen Gerard Cole couldn't pick that up and it's run away by Nikol Kovac you remember put creation front in the fifth minute of the game but Paul schools has equalized and at the moment we just take the draw any chance of the final whistle for the region we're not even at half time we're gonna throw into Croatia near side of the field and what one minute of stoppage time has been allotted Steve McLaren out in the technical area he's shouting Eric's is not a shouter McLaren certainly is now it's headed on by repage but there's no blue shirt after that and David James has it remember in the game four years ago in Charlotte why England that remaining by two goals to one and lost three to England have come from behind here tonight in Lisbon not a great ball from Gary Neville lampard couldn't pick that up now it's taken up by Sokota Sokota with persos through the center but it's in the center circle now with Nikol Kovac and now Rosso who's moved towards the left side for a change Zivkovits the captain on to Rapaj better spell from Croatia Rapaj spins he's moving towards the penalty area then his pass was intercepted by Gerard lampard hacks it forward and now on takes it up all's got lots of room Michael Owen has turned and he's moving towards the penalty area plays it back to Scholes on to one again schools once more here's a half chance for Rudy ready shop a glorious goal a glorious strike from the 18 year old his third goal of Euro 2004 and in a matter of minutes England from being a goal down a two-one in front Rudy from 30 yards a cracking right foot shot England to Croatia one well I had to be that man really whatever Zidane can do really can match as well what a magnificent shot but Tina and goal got a right hand to it but he hit it with such power and such a bend on the ball as well no goalkeeper would have saved that as well but he did well to get a hand to it it might even have broken his hand it was a wonderful strike great move from England good to play between Scholes and Owen set Rudy up slightly right a center 22 23 yards out and he smashed it in the back of the net this is a scenario that we wanted England to be ahead it's only a game and he's only 18 and he doesn't give us stuff who he's playing against really without natural talent and there is the half-time whistle perfect timing as well and can I tell you that in group B as it stands at the moment England are in first place France are in second and the half-time scoreline here in Lisbon is too one-to-ing well England have gone from third to first in six minutes in that group Graham Taylor sorry almost took your shoulder off of Rudy scored that's the best they've played they're playing very very well the thing is that when you do go go down as they did you get very nervous these boys reacted so positively to that the game had hardly started they find themselves a goal down they've passed the ball they've moved it better than they have done in any of the other two games they've created shooting opportunities goal scoring chance they thoroughly deserve to be two one in the lead and you could see it coming it was going to be a major surprise if it didn't come they've played very very well in this half David Beckham might have the arm band but Stephen Gerard's the captain on the field at the moment isn't he Gerard has been magnificent he's searched on as soon as they went to down the next thing that you saw was Gerard going at the Croatian defense he Rooney Ashley Cole that some good performances going out there what we all suffer from at times when we're looking at a game is what the score line is at the present time as I said when we won nil down we were nervous that little bit it's understandable so but those boys didn't show that that's what has impressed me with them they've really shown great character they thoroughly deserve to be in the lead and there's been some good performances by a number of the England players I understand that you and Terry Butcher don't want us to go over the top about Wayne Rooney but when people see the goal they'll see his first touch wasn't very good and yet he still manages to get the power and the accuracy on that shot good movement by England came in took it to one side and there was the power the ball moved a great deal but the boy what's that she's third goal in the tournament we're into the only the third match he's been absolutely first-class Rooney has in the last two years and he's been a part of this game particularly with his mate Gerard Gerard John Murray's in Coimbra it's France against Switzerland John what's happening well I can tell you mark that France have got a game on their hands here it is one one at half time between France and Switzerland Pires started superbly on the left for France by the way with Zidane in a more central floating role Zidane it was who headed France into the lead is third from the right hand side that in the 20th minute of the match France then really had a spell where they had Switzerland so stretched they won four successive corners all reason Mr. couple of headers really good chances for him but he's put one high and one wide and the equalizer for Switzerland came six minutes after France had taken the lead and it was scored by the 18 year old Johan von Lonten who plays for PSV Eindhoven he's 18 years old he's younger than Wayne Rooney so he's now taken Rooney's record as the youngest ever scorer in a European Championship finals and a good goal it was well taken little ball through from Cabanas von Lonten turned inside the box and in a low shot past the outstretched leg of Fabio Mbatez but it is it's a competitive game and it is France won Switzerland one at half time so at the moment it's gonna be England against Greece and Portugal against France we thought it'd be England against Greece but we thought because England would come second and Greece would win the group but that's you know there's still 45 minutes to go so let's not get ahead of ourselves Mark Clements in the legends down a good ason where I suspect the roof has been taken off. Wow yeah they've only just shut up we've got all the old legends chatting in the background there Brian LeBorn Gordon Wessie Derek Malfield but I've pulled out John Hunter because John you're a scout at the academy my goodness gracious mate what kind of what kind of player have you uncovered here? Well it's a great team for the academy and it's a great atmosphere. There we go again. Oh there we go again in the background. Did you feel it was coming I mean what's your assessment of that? Well it's always a threat isn't he when he gets the ball it just sets everyone alive he's a great friend great person. And he was really getting stuck in there as a provider as well you know he's chance wasn't coming but he was laying in one or two he puts goals in at one stage. He's done great. He's had it for the goal. Yeah and he's bumming. He's insist it's just as good as a goal isn't he? Can we hang on to this now do you think? I think we'll go three or four now. If he's on sit back. Alright then and I guess who they think will get it Mark I'll tell you as well. Incidentally baby elephant you and I were chatting about this on air the other day. I believe it's got some origins in China. What his nickname? His nickname baby elephant. Actually John's just going to quickly clarify that for us. I don't know. Oh I thought you were he was making us know he was. Baby elephant is his nickname out in China apparently. And also I think one newspaper journalist liken him to the baby elephant on blue Peter because he has rampaging and causing trouble. Clem thank you very much. Graham Taylor again here in Lisbon England two Croatian one if you're just tuning in. I want to stick up for Michael and I've been watching quite carefully and he's not getting a lot of help not getting much they're trying to hit diagonal balls to him long balls to him they've got huge great hulk oak trees of centre halves asking an awful lot of Michael Owen who is looking busy to see. He is he's looking much busier than he has done in the previous two games and that's a good sign and he was there then when the goal came for schools who's I thought he was going to score Nick it over the keeper didn't quite get it that's just how it's going for him because any of the time it would have been gone. Fortunately it came back out and Paul schools got the header to to equalize but I think Michael Owen has had a good game. I think a lot of the England players I can't really turn around and say everybody's had a real stinker. Yes we'd like David Beckham to be involved more we expect so much about him but I think just generally if we look at that performance I think it's been very very good just what England needed. We've got the seven or eight out of eleven that you wanted you needed before kickoff doing their very best. I think so I think yeah we've seven or eight who are playing well. England two Croatia one and a half time at the moment England are going to throw and win the group at the moment because it's France one Switzerland one time for the news on five life. Live news live sport. This is BBC Radio 5 Live. Thanks Mark good evening the fireman from Kent convicted of football violence in Portugal has said he'll appeal. Gary Mann was jailed for two years but illegal technicality means he won't serve his sentence here. The Home Secretary David Blunkett has said he will pursue the case against Mr Mann. The 46 year old firefighter said he was nowhere near the riot and CCTV evidence which he claims would prove his whereabouts has been destroyed. Gary Mann said he was beaten up by military police while he was on his way back to his hotel. The Fair Trials Abroad organization said what it called David Blunkett's dire tribe that he wanted to nail Gary Mann showed the Home Secretary didn't know what he was talking about and may mean a fair trial anywhere would be impossible. Two England fans arrested during the disturbances in the Algarve have been banned from attending matches around the world for the next three years. The men from Barnsley arrived back in Britain yesterday after being deported. Three British naval boats which entered Iranian territorial waters without permission have been seized. Eight crew members have been detained. British diplomats are trying to secure their release. Rail and tube workers are planning a 24 hour strike next Tuesday. The walkout over pay and pensions will cause massive disruption on the rail network and on the London underground. And the referee of tonight's England match, Pierre-Louis G. Collina, is to get an honorary degree from the University of Hull next month. The award is in recognition of his outstanding contribution to football. Let's check on the roads tonight on the M4 in Buckinghamshire, one lane blocked eastbound between Junction 7 for Slough West and 6 for Slough because of an accident and a Barkshire heavy rain making driving conditions difficult. Both ways at Junction 10, that's redding at the moment. In Northamptonshire, the A45 is closed northbound at Junction 13 of the A14 at Thratston for recovery of an overturned van. There are pretty long queues reported back from Wellingborough. Finally, the A84 in Stirling should be closed on Leeney Road at the Tulefan Crescent Junction in Stirling. That's for emergency installation work. On the trains tonight, south-eastern services subject to delays of up to 45 minutes after an earlier signalling problem at Newington.

And this is Mark Puget in the Estadio de Luz, in Lisbon. It's all turned around, thankfully so far. England 2-Croatia won at half-time sculls and Rooney in the last five minutes of the first half after England went one down to a goal after five minutes from Nikko Kovac. Now it's been the only day at Wimbledon, Alastair Eakin can round it all up. Thanks very much, Mark. The men's defending champion Roger Federer dropped just six games today in brushing aside Britain's Alex Bogdanovich. Fellow Brit Arvind Palmer didn't survive either. He lost three tie breaks to Gilles Elsenere of Belgium. But the 2001 champion made a stunning return to the Lawns of SW 19. Injury had prevented Gorin Ivanishovich from playing here since winning the title three years ago. But he enjoyed a straight-sets win over the 31st seed, Mikhail Yuzhnik. That was worth it for these two years, struggling, doing therapy, all kinds of therapy, being up and down, thinking to stop. But it was worth it to fight and come back and be today on the set of court. 2001-2002 champion Layton Hewitt rather is through after a straight-sets victory over Jurgen Meltzer of Austria. But the man who knocked out Hewitt in the first round last year, Evo Kalović of Croatia, struck again, ousting the number 13 seed, Paradon Strickapan of Thailand in four sets. The number 29 seed, Nicholas Keefe, was beaten by the former Australian Open champion, Thomas Jahanssen. The sixth seed won Carlos Freiro, and the tenth seed, Sebastian Grozior, both came through. In the women's singles, no question about the headline grabber, 47-year-old Martina Navratilova, the nine-times champion who hadn't played a singles here for 10 years. She lost just one game in dispatching Catalina Castagna of Colombia and feels she justified her entry. Playing tennis is for the fans, it's not for anyone else. It's for the people to enjoy it, and of course, for the players to enjoy it. If we don't enjoy it, there's a problem. That's a game, people forget that. This is a game, people take it too seriously. And Navratilova's next opponent will be Gisela Dulkov of Argentina, who knocked her out of the French Open, and today accounted for the 23rd seed, Yelena Dockich. The two-times former champion, Venus Williams is through, as are the French Open champion, Anastasia Mischina, Lindsay Davenport, Maria Sharapova and Alicia Mollick. Two British women have made it through to the second round as well. And Kyodafong and Emily Webby Smith were both straight-sets winners. Amanda Jains lost in three to the 11th seed, Aizugi Yama of Japan. Alastair, thank you very much indeed. Putting in a pre-miserable day for the cricketers today in the Frizzell County Championship, just one positive result for Johnny Saunders to tell us about. Second division leaders, Nottinghamshire beat Derbyshire by 10 wickets at Trent Bridge. Derbyshire all out for 355 in their second innings following on. Charlie Shrek with 6 for 103. Nottinghamshire only needed 24 for victory. They got there without losing a wicket. There was a very close game at the oval where Gloucestershire's tail managed to hold on against Surrey. They finished in their second innings on 255 for 9, a lead of just 25. So that match was drawn, as were all the others. First division leaders, Warwickshire got to 124 for 2 in their second innings against Lancashire at Stratford, an overall lead of 115. Lords, Worcestershire were all out for 399 in their first innings against Middlesex, play finished for the day with Middlesex, 8 for 1 in their second innings. And at the heading lead, Yorkshire were all out in their first innings for 283 in response to Leicestershire's 289 all out. Let's have a word with Terry Butcher then. Terry, England were 2-1 up at halftime against Romania. We should just strike a word of caution. Anything can happen. Yes, it can do, but nerves will obviously play a part in the second half. I think Romania are a better team than Croatia at the time. And this is a better England team than it was four years ago as well. I mean, it's great. They've got a great character. To go a goal down that early, five or six minutes, they showed a lot of great character. They got the goals chance just after that as well, which obviously lifted England, lifted the players. And then after that, it was just one-way traffic. There have been signs that Croatia can get back into the game with the two strikers who have got a good movement, but the answer being supported well by midfield that really have been overrun in the first half. This is the best England have played for quite some considerable time, I feel. They're showing confidence, they're showing a great attitude. When they lose a ball, they go and press it well as a unit. David Beckham's not playing particularly well, but the rest of the team are, and the rest of the team are up for it. Avicio Mourna reports with his warming up. A man mountain of a centre forward who very nearly scored against France in stoppage time. We may well be seeing him at half-time. Graham Taylor, to what extent of the fact that the England fullbacks have got forward more, particularly Ashley Cole, has been part of this much better England performance, do you think? Well, they've needed to do, and I think Ashley Cole has had a good tournament because with him not having an out-and-out midfield player in front of him, he very rarely has somebody to play wide to and play himself in and get really behind the opposition defence, but he's kept coming. It's been big runs for him, and here's another one. I think he's played well in this tournament, I think he's playing very well tonight, and it is important that we use the full width of the pitch, and sometimes with goals going in, the only width we sometimes get from inside the opponent's half is with Ashley Cole or Gary Neville coming on to the ball, which they've both done well. Terry, from your point of view, how do England look defensively, particularly at centre half? I think they look OK, just one long ball from the left-hand side, England's right-hand side, that's gone over the top of John Terry. I think it was Perso that made a good break into the space where Solcamo should have been. They weren't covering each other particularly well on that occasion, and one ball through the middle, cutting them in half, and David James made a very, very good save, so the warning signs are there. They're going to have to defend as a unit and make sure that they defend as a first from the two strikers, midfield four and then the back four, but they've got to be tighter. I just feel that it's just going to be lack of concentration and nerves now, that might cost England dear, but if they approach it with the same sort of spirit that they showed in the first half in particular, that's the most animated I've seen quite a few of England players. They won the ball back early, they passed it, Gerard was inspirational, Rune was inspirational as well, because he was coming off, I can't remember him really giving the ball away, he's linking it well, he's beating players, he's taking people on, and even Stephen Gerard is taking people on as well. I think we might have a change here for Croatia as well in the second half. Graham, a final word from you, the England manager would be a fairly easy half-time team talk. Same again, boys. Same again, keep it going, keep playing, keep passing, keep you moving, make sure you keep your concentration right. This side now has to score a couple of goals, doesn't it? Or that's only going to happen if Croatia play exceptionally well, or there's some real carelessness in the England defence. Keep listening, wherever you are, 6-0-6 interactive with Mark Bright is coming up at 10 o'clock, the Croats are out, the England team aren't, and my kingdom, I have to tell you, was looking a bit down in the mouth like the rest of us at 1-0 down. Well, it was a repeated shallower, and it still could be, still thinking that in another, but it did remind me a lot of the first half of Munich, actually, the way that they fell behind against Germany against the run of play, and then Gerard Propeller went back into action. Let's hope it's the same as Munich. The Croatian change brings on Mornar from Portsmouth, of course, he'll play down the right-hand side. One of the defenders, Robert Kovac, has been withdrawn, so Zivkovic will go into the back four. So he'll go into the position normally occupied by Robert Kovac. Mornar will play on the right, and Rosso moves in field. Croatia playing from right to left in this second half. Remember the late sting in the tail eight days ago when France got those two goals when England seemed to have the initiative? Well, just at the moment, Scholes has scored his first goal in 30 games, his first since the course of the goal against Greece, and England, if everything stayed the way it is at the moment, would play Greece in the quarter-final, and not Portugal, but there's a long way to go yet. France remember drawing 1-1 with Switzerland, give you the line-ups in a moment, it's now Perso finds Mornar for the first time. A tall figure up against Ashley Cole. Decent ball in the area, needs clearing by Gary Neville. England concede a corner kick inside 40 seconds of the restart, the second half. And remember we've been pointing out how fallible England have been from set pieces. Corner kick will be taken by the man who delivered the free kick, Rapaic. Rapaic's ball into the area, headed away and out of the area. Mornar will chase it over on the far side of the field, he won't get it. England then with David James, Gary Neville, John Terry, Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole. David Beckham, Stephen Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes, at last a goal from him, Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen, 8 goals in 17 games from Wayne Rooney. The revised Croatian side now, Butina in goal, they have Simic, Zivkovic, Siminic and Tudor, the defenders, not quite in that order, as Croatia now look to try and build and Rapaic just throws himself down on the edge of the area. To start the second half well, rest of the Croatian side now, Mornar, Rosso, Nikko Kovac the goal scorer, Rapaic, Perso and Sokota. Now Gerrard gives the ball to Rooney for the first time and he's handball given against Zivkovic, the Croatian captain, the match brilliantly refereed as ever by Pierluisi Kalina. Stephen Gerrard now for England, looking to find Michael Owen, away by Tudor. Oh, he's far as Scholes, Scholes drives it, doesn't really get hold of it, keep a safe. Confidence should be sky high now, Paul Scholes, the first goal for three years, a big monkey off his back now and coming on to the edge of the box here, the ball just knocked out by Tudor, he hit it, second touch, he hit it, but low down to Butina's right, comfortable save. England mustn't sit back though here, they must play to their strengths, they trouble Croatia with their spirit and the pressure that they applied after Croatia's shock start, the goal from Nikko Kovac after five minutes scrambled in following a free kick. Ashley Cole, then England throw in over on the far side, obviously will keep you in touch with France and Switzerland throughout the second half. France went in front, Switzerland equalised, but it's far too premature at the moment to be talking about a likely quarterfinal line-up. England in their red shirts have a throw in over on the far side, thrown by Ashley Cole, doesn't find Michael Owen and Croatia now looking to try and counterattack once more, all headed forward, Campbell's there and the clearance by Cole and the second half yet to really settle down. Gerard steps in gigantically once more and now England look for Beckham, and England look for a better performance from Beckham. Beckham up against Siminic down this near side of the field, across comes the defender, in fact Beckham really invited the challenge and the challenge was duly applied. Throw to England near side of the field, Gary Neville into Gerard, if he don't give it to Gerard. Back again to Beckham now, near side the England right, good running from Lampard, Lampard being held up on the edge of the area, allowed though to turn by the defender, Lampard into Gerard, Gerard doesn't control it first time, then heads the ball into the area towards Gary Neville, and England must make the Croatians defend here, they must pull them back inside their own half. It's good movement from England, it's good interplay down the right hand side, and Gerard was unlucky, but it was Gary Neville who made the run inside, back him into the penalty area similar to the run that he made for the third goal against Switzerland, and Gerard's pass not quite there. Throw in to England, taken and Michael Owen gets an awkward bounce, Croatia don't really clear it, and Gerard now always played that behind Lampard, and this is always the danger now on the break. Mistake by Steven Gerard, and cut out though by Cole, otherwise Morna would have threatened over on the far side, what an important header that was by Cole. Cole into Skoles, it's a bit short, defender I thought came in on Skoles, but the referee's played an advantage, Ashley Cole down the England left, finds Wayne Rooney, Rooney tries to drag the ball away from the defender, great play from Rooney on to Skoles, Skoles shoots, keeper makes a bit of a meal of that one, turns it away for a corner kick, great reply from England, corner to Beckham. Yeah, great save as well, Bettino, it was a good shot, game from Skoles on the edge of the box, dead centre, put it to the low, to the keeper's right, and keeper made a good double handed save for a corner, but once again, Ashley Cole, great cover down there, got forward one-two with Skoles, good ball inside, good shot from Skoles, and yeah, Ashley Cole's flying with Gerard, and really for Man of the Match so far. Wonderful support for England, England two, Croatia one, England coming from behind, they don't have to win the game remember. It's David Beckham with an England corner, another goal would do nicely now for England. Beckham waits, in goes the corner kick for England, looking for Campbell, headed away by Croatia, and another corner near side, and we keep on mentioning of course the game four years ago, but I'm bound to say now, having seen Croatia for 50 minutes, this Croatian side are not a patch on the Romanian team who beat England in Shalva. Beckham conserving in his energy, if England let this one slip now against this very moderate opposition, if they let two in now and don't at least get the draw that they need, there'll be no forgiving. Corner kick to England near side of the field, two, one they lead, headed away by Croatia, not clearance not completed, Skoles is there waiting once more on the edge of the area, Skoles finds Gary Neville, Beckham's available, Neville finds Beckham, Terry stayed forward, and it goes towards Skoles, headed away, headed back in again by John Terry it was who stayed forward. Croatia having real problems clearing, Gerard doesn't control it first time, tried to take the ball on without really controlling it, Croatia clear and Campbell's back inside his own half to snatch it away from Perce. Well they've got three forwards, Virte on the pitch now, Mourna, a Portsmouth gone out to the right hand side of midfield, he's very quick, he's the man that scored the consolation goal for Croatia, Portman Road in the friendly 3-1, and he's very very quick, but Ashley Cole is quick as well, and Ashley Cole has defended magnificently well. Well there's an injury to the goalkeeper, Latina, and so there's a chance with the physios coming on to have a look at him, to bring in Graham Taylor once more, we've had six minutes of the second half Graham, are you happy with the way England have started? Yeah the signs out, they're going to continue doing what they did in the first half, and that's got to be good news for everybody. I mean Terrius said, I also think that this is by far the best I've seen England play for a number of games now, irrespective of the opposition, they just have to be careful that they don't allow the Croatians to break at them, but now it's a question of keeping your tempo of the game, the heat isn't here, it's a lovely evening, smashing night to play football, so keep the tempo, keep you passing, keep you moving, and just keep doing what you're doing. I think Ashley Cole is having as good a game as I've seen him having in England sure. Yeah absolutely, and he was saying recently that he still didn't think he'd really made it yet as an international footballer, he hadn't been happy with the many of his performances, but he's blossoming at this tournament. Now the goalkeeper's alright, but it's the usual emotional rollercoaster watching England, they never do it simply, and the game continues, and Zivkovic hoists a long ball to the far side of the field, they can put it in the air to Mornar because he's got the height advantage over Ashley Cole, Tudor, the Juventus defender. Now Niko Kovac, Kovac looking for Mornar, Cole lets it run on, and he can let it run on because it's going to defeat Perso, and David James, who handles stuff pretty well, I mean the goal of course was a shocker, but everything that was thrown at him after that he held onto. Actually the free kick when it came in, it came off Ashley Cole, I think David James was taken by surprise, he's got a point blank save really, pushed the ball out past John Terry's legs, and there was Kovac to put it in the back of the net with no chance for David James, but he's handled it very well, he's made one or two saves, low down, and he's done his job well. Seven minutes gone in the second half, you're listening to Five Live, England to Croatia one, France one, Switzerland one, and if the scores stay like that then England will win the group, and they will play a quarter-final against Greece. It's a free kick to England, and noticeably they're taking a bit of time over it as well. Kiel, Luigi Collina won't allow them to do that, still Cole to take it, Ashley Cole now steadies himself, and hits it long towards Rooney, Rooney's beaten in the air by Tudor. Croatia now looking to get going over on that far side of the field with Simic, but it's closed down on the halfway line by Lampard, Ashley Cole is needed once more, he's lost out now, Perso. Mornar's made the run down the right-hand side, it's gone back into the centre-circle though, and now Croatia move towards this near side of the field, skim forward by Simic, looking for Mornar. Mornar will out-jump Ashley Cole, and there's danger here from Perso on the edge of the area, throws himself down theatrically, referee's happy, Rooney on the counter-attack, Owen trying to stay onside, Rooney's beaten the offside trap, Owen's going forward in the area, hit it, Michael Owen over the goalkeeper, and just over the bar, Michael Owen could have done with that. What that would have done for Owen if he could have chipped it in the back of the net, great play again by Wayne Rooney. Well that's what we wanted to see, a chance set up for Michael Owen by Wayne Rooney, because Owen has set up Rooney, well one of Rooney's goals as well against Switzerland, but the compliment was reversed then, Michael Owen, if anything for me didn't seem to have the confidence and the speed to take it on into the penalty area to go one-on-one against the goalkeeper, he was pushed to the right-hand side and thought, well I'm not going to blast it, I'm just going to chip the goalkeeper, but he put it about a foot over the bar. That could have been his Munich moment. Now, controversially, Olic, the man who failed the drugs test, but is still allowed to continue in this tournament, has come on, and I've no idea who's gone off. Rapaich, is it Rapaich? Rapaich has gone off, has he? Well, Olic, number 18, is on England lead 2-1, Gerard now again trying to beat the offside trap, goalkeeper will get that though this time. Out comes Butina, so Olic playing down this left-hand side of the field, has got good pace, but wouldn't it be ironic if he played a major part now in this game, bearing in mind everything that happened around Rio Ferdinand. Don't forget, of course, a little later, as Croatia now build, and I'll give you that detail in a moment, Weaver 6-0-6, interactive following this program from 10 with Mark Breit and Mark Lawrensen, 0-500-909-6-9-3. France 1, Switzerland 1, England 2, Croatia 1, England will be behind, after 5 minutes trailing to Niko Kobach's goal, they came back through Scholes and Rooney, and if only Michael Owen could have scored a third there. Now, lovely play from England, Rooney's back inside his own half, holes off the defender very easily. Rooney towards Beckham, Beckham steps over the ball and flicks it back to Gary Neville, and they're playing with confidence. Gary Neville, I thought, was held off by Olic, that's his first contribution since he came on, and we've played already 10 minutes of the second half. 2-1 to England, they could do with a third to really settle their nerves here. Gary Neville, again showing his experience, taking plenty of time over this free kick. Again, the drum beat round the stadium, freeing the Osset, terrible free kick from Gary Neville, straight back to the Croatians. Olic now will be beaten for pace by Stephen Gerrard, and it's Gary Neville again with quick feet at right back. Stephen Gerrard thumps the ball rather aimlessly this time into the Croatian half. Beckham will apply the pressure on the defender, Zivkovic. Zivkovic, who thinks he knows how to play Beckham, because of course, had the upper hand against him, playing for Bayer Leberkusen when they got to the Champions League final. Throw into Croatia. Overall though, they have been very much second best in this game. It'll be criminal now if England lose this one. Long ball now, and David James hasn't come for it, and Olic has all on his own down the left-hand side. Why didn't James come out? And he goes right across the penalty area. Hesitation there by England, as Niko Kovac collects over on the far side the field. That was poor play by England. The ball is chipped into the area, headed down and a chance now maybe for Perso, goes round the defender, he's blocked, Mornos there, flag is up over on the far side for offside, and that was fairly shambolic by England. Well, that was just one long ball over the top into the right back area. Everybody expecting David James to come out. Gary Neville in particular, everybody stopped. David James just retreated back onto his line. Olic took the ball down to the byline, crossed it, it wasn't clear by England. It was missed by everybody towards the far post, and then the shot came in from Perso. It was blocked by John Terry and Sol Campbell, diving out on the edge of the box. The ball going through to David James, and Mornos was in an upside position. I just wonder as well whether Michael Owen missed, and with that pivotal miss from David Beckham in the match against France, when the penalty spot is when England needed to go two goals up, they did it from David Beckham, and were made to pay the penalty. That underlines why England need another, as Beckham misplaces the pass, but Rooney will turn it into a better one. Rooney looking just slightly over reaches Michael Owen with the ball into the area. The intention was right, but the final execution not. Well, Croatia, if they're given opportunities like that, can still punish England here. The ball over on the far side, the field. Now Rosso. Rosso plays it down the right, and watched the marker in the area. In goes across Campbell, missed it. Gerard is there to hoof it away into the centre circle. Rooney waiting for it to drop up against Zivkovich. Once the free kick, Wayne Rooney now needs to calm down because the decisions be given against him, and Croatia move it forward quickly. Kovac, we can just call him Kovac now because there's only one Kovac on the pitch. Robert having been taken off at half time. Now, where's the marking in midfield from England? This is Croatia encouraged by this. Mornar at the moment, it's off the pitch. It's Simonic, and England all getting now back behind the ball, apart from Michael Owen, who could have put this game beyond Croatia, but chipped the ball over the goalkeeper and over the bar. Croatia stab it forward into the area. The runner there is Olic. Danger here, certainly Olic and Purso together. Olic still inside the penalty area, up against Ashley Cole. The cross will come in from the right-hand side. James doesn't need to get across. Mornar, he's off the pitch and he seems to be arguing with the Croatian bench down there. I don't know what his problem is, whether he's got some blood on his face or something, and they've told him to get off the pitch. At the moment, Croatia are down to 10 men, and he seems to have a problem with his tongue. David James, I think, and the collision with David James when he was offside with the chance came in. He's always bit his tongue, he's got a cut on his tongue. The game is all about rhythm, though, and England mustn't lose the initiative here, with almost exactly an hour gone. England have a 2-1 lead. They could daily do with another goal. Frank Lampard, no. Support down the left from Ashley Cole. Rooney, no, in ahead of him. Lampard shoots. The ball might break to Owen, goalkeepers there. Lampard a bit selfish there. He had other options around him, and he chose to ignore them. Good pressure from England. They've won the ball back. Good pressure. Good play by Gerard. Becken, Rooney's waiting. Gerard on the edge of the penalty area. 2-1 to England. Here's a chance. No, Rooney doesn't make real contact, and Owen was waiting behind him. He was onside as well, 2-1 to the players, Owen and Rooney in the box then from Gerard's cross. They've got to be careful. It's end-to-end stuff. It looks like Croatia are playing a 4-2-4-0. Four forwards on the pitch then for them. England don't want the game to open up too much here. 2-1 they lead. And they're just under half an hour away from a place in the quarterfinals. Long ball now trying to stretch the creations. Owen doesn't control it first time. Owen now up against two defenders, trying to get away from both of them. Gives it back into midfield to Lampard. 35 yards away from the Croatian goal. Rooney to Beckham. Seemed a bit surprised to get that, David Beckham. Beckham turns, looks at goal, doesn't get the shot in. Rooney now trying to get it through for Lampard, and trying to walk the ball in here. They're just looking to try and walk it in. And now Mornar, who's come back on again, fleet-footed, breaks down the right-hand side into Perso. England need to mark up in midfield now. Here's a shot coming in from Rosso, easily saved by David James. And now what's more, Grand Taylor? A very open game, this going from end-to-end. Probably the most open game we've seen in the tournament. And from the spectators' point of view, if you're neutral, you'd think this is a very good game. From England's point of view, you'd just like to close it in a little bit and make sure you play it and keep it in the Croatian half more than we're doing at the present time. I'd like us to sustain our attacks as we were doing in the first half. And for me now, with half an hour to go, this would have been the moment for Owen Hargreaves. Had he been fit or nicky but. Mornar breaks again down the right-hand side, tries to cut the ball back. John Terry then was a double over with an injury inside the area, but then got to his feet very quickly. His ankle, I think it's his left ankle, I think he twisted it. As he went up for a header, he headed the ball out to Ashley Cole who made the mistake for Mornar to get in. John Terry went down, I think he twisted his ankle. Needs to get attention. The game continues and John Terry needs to receive attention. Ball in the area, headed away by Cole. Lampard now to complete the clearance. And this is where, as Rooney tries to escape and is fouled, there's a yellow card here for somebody. Well, he is one of the few players in the Croatian side, not on a yellow card. It may not matter, of course, but England now could do with an Owen Hargreaves if he was fully fit or a nicky but just to come on and tighten up in midfield. Gary Neville's signalling that John Terry has, I think he's signalling, he's going to have to come off. He may have to have Lettley King in this game. Yeah, Lettley King just going out to stretch his legs and warm up. We've got to, I think, fill Neville down there as well. Fill Neville won't go centre half because, you know, Lettley King is an automatic replacement. Just have a look at John Terry, see how he's moving. Seems okay at the moment. Well, the quarter-finals are in only three or four days' time and it's silly if Terry's handicap to keep him on the pitch. Lettley King didn't let anybody down when he played here against France. Still a lot of work for England to do. England leading by two goals to one. Goal right at the end of the first half in added time from Wayne Rooney, following on from Paul Scholes equaliser. Croatia, though, have shown that it can be dangerous. Certainly, Mornar's made a difference since he came on with his powerful presence down the right. Robert Kovac now, long the field towards Mornar there and they're knocking it across to him, giving it to him in the air as well. Mornar taking on Ashley Cole, Cole sticking tight to Mornar. Mornar in the end, wins the corner off the Arsenal left back. Corner to Croatia, 63 and a half minutes gone here. Here we go with the set piece again. Good defending from Ashley Cole. Mornar one on one, just about on the byline. Good defending concedes the corner but England bring everybody back on corners. What do England leave at least one or two up to keep Croatian defenders back? Now, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven Croatian players going into the box. Gary Neville certainly made a sign that he thought John Terry was out of the game but Terry's still in the penalty area as the corner kick is swung in deep and England do clear it but it's a rare break and it's Rooney all on his own. He's trying to go from the half way line. He was all on his own. There were no other options. Michael Owen couldn't join in over on the far side and that was Rooney almost went in on the goalkeeper. That has to be very, very careful. What are you pointing out Terry? Simic is limping. Simic was the one that came on and tackled Wayne Rooney. I think he might have twisted his ankle as well. Number 13, the right back and the clearance almost shut down then by Wayne Rooney but he looks lively. There's one run. England needs one run from Wayne Rooney to make it to put it beyond doubt. Put it beyond doubt at 3-1. Game over, thanks very much but it is very, very open at the moment. Four forwards on, make it very, very open. That was two fouls there by Olić on Beckham. He apologised for the first. Then he went and whacked him again ten seconds later. Pierluigi Collina comes across the referee and gives Olić a last warning and England have taken the free kick very quickly and it's Stephen Gerard trying to muscle his way through. Takes on too many defenders though and the free kick is given and we move towards the half way point of this second half. Remember France won, Switzerland won, five live, England two, Croatia one. Just at the moment England are heading the group. They don't really mind where they finish though. They just want to qualify for the first time overseas in this championship. Short free kick. Gerard doesn't get it forward though. Croatia looking to try and get out of their own half. It's a good ball to Zivkovic. Zivkovic plays it to the far side of the field. Looking for Mornar who's giving England a few problems but he's just gone straight into Ashley Cole and that's a free kick to England over on the far side of the field. That's an unfair confrontation physically. Those two, they would have met before of course in the Premiership. Mornar who's been at Portsmouth on loan from Anderlecht and as Terry was saying scored a goal against England way back in August at Portman Road. Little did we think that night in August when England were beating Croatia 3-1 that they would meet again at this stage. We're going to have a change. Cernar I think is coming on in a moment. Number eight. Another change. They can't throw any more forwards on. They've got four on at the moment but I think he's a right side midfield player. I mean the way that it is very, very opening and they've got the sort of numerical advantage in midfield but they're not making it count because Croatia are passing through England to midfield at will here. England need to concentrate. Croatia of course had an excellent second half against France and England have had problems in the second half in tournament football. Here now comes Robert Kovac. Knocks the ball back to Perso. Perso trying to set himself up. It's well blocked by Gary Neville. England need a third here and then the anxiety would ease around the stadium. They've got the balls back inside the Croatian half England. They've got everyone now back behind the ball. Croatia laid it wretchedly out of play and now the change can be made and it's going to be Simic who as Terry was saying picked up an injury a few moments ago. Simic who's been playing it right back and he'll come off and on comes Cernar. So that's the end of the changes from Croatia. Cernar plays in the Ukraine for Shakhtar Donetsk. England so close now to the quarterfinals. Rune doesn't control it and it's back with Tudor. Croatia who just scraped into this event of course in the playoffs against Slovenia. England really shouldn't be having the problems that they've had here this evening. In terms of personnel on the pitch they would appear to have an advantage but of course they've got to make it payers. Now Rune controls it beautifully inside the centre circle. Ohm's trying to stay onside. Ohm back again to Rune. Go on Rune. Finish it off. Here's your opportunity. Rune scores for England and surely, surely, surely for the first time in their history they have reached the quarterfinals of the European Championship away from home. Four years ago it was disaster against Romania. Tonight it's the right foot of Romania. And England surely are there. Well a fantastic finish from Wayne Rune. He was ice cold when he was put through. 101 versus the goalkeeper. Dead centre. He hit his shot from going just outside the box. The goalkeeper went to his left. The shot went to his right in the back of the net. There's no doubt as soon as it left his foot into the back of the net that's the goal that England needed. The language from the Croatian players here. I think it could be game over. Well I'm sorry, Rune, but it's one all now. Yeah, I looked at the watch, you know. That was 22 minutes and 29 seconds. I don't care, Michael. Disciple-leaved. Rune, the leading goal scorer in Euro 2004. Four goals. Graham. That's May Colso. He's finished tremendously well there. Kitted the goalkeeper. Put it to the side. Let's give credit to Michael Owen. He's been involved in two of the goals. He's been criticism for not scoring. I think he's been a good foil for Rune. Well, I think John Terry, who's involved in an England attack at the moment might be coming off very shortly because Leading King is about to come on. And logically, that would be for Terry. But you never know. I mean, Leading King has been playing all season for Spurs in a defensive midfield position. But here comes Rosso forward to Mournar. Gets the cross. It is a great one-turn. It's headed away by Gary Neville. Left behind for a corner, is it? Oh, it's maybe a goal kick. I'm not quite sure what happened there. Usually, Terry? Yeah, I support... It's actually... Four goals. Yeah, that's what I was saying. That Leading King is a defensive midfield player. And he can just sit in front of the backboard. Maybe Terry's problem is not so significant. Scores comes off. He could easily have been David Beckham, actually. I'll tell you why. They got the signs that John Terry was OK, because John Terry was sprinting up the left wing about two minutes ago. And so, Porta Michaelon and Porta Wayne Rooney, I don't know what he was doing up there, but it was a good break from John Terry. He looks OK. He won't want to come off, and Leading King goes right into the centre of midfield. Gerard goes out to the left, lamp out in the middle with Leading King, and obviously back him to the right. England leading by three goals to one. France are being held by Switzerland 1-1. And suddenly, we're actually quite interested in that score line. But here it's played forward and down to left-hand side, and over hit that pass by Lampard beyond Gerard. And it's out of play for a throw-in to Croatia. And there's going to be another change, too. Vasell is coming on for England. It must be for Rooney. Well, I think Michaelon, having been substituted twice, I think psychologically, now you leave O'Anon, but who knows? Yeah, but he's on a yellow card. Absolutely. That's not saying you leave Michael O'Anon. You don't take O'Anon. No, I leave him on. He's doing well, Michaelon. He's running the line, he's looking for gaps behind that Croatian defence, and there are plenty now. Back him, hits it outfield. That comes off Tudor. Almost falls for O'Anne, but it's cleared by Tudor. And then Gerard wins it again. Those flip was a little high, and that is a free kick to Croatia. And here's the change, and it is Vasell for Rooney. Well, the only thing we're missing now tonight is a Michael-O'Anne goal. Exactly. That would be the icing on the cake, if that was to happen. And hopefully Gerard Vasell can provide Michael O'Anne with the goal, the way that he provided Wayne Rooney with the goal against Switzerland. Listen to the response of the England fans for Wayne Rooney, who gets the handshake from Beckham, applause for the response. Fabulous. Fabulous. Four goals in Euro 2004 as an 18-year-old. But, O'Anne, how long have we waited for this performance from England? We waited a long while for this fluency. We talked about being fluid. The French won about being fluid. England have been very fluid tonight. They've been fantastic in terms of passing the ball and keeping the ball a half-time. They showed a 50% possession for England, which was unheard of in terms of recent England performances. At the moment, England are topping the group. Fans are second. They're being held by the Swiss. There's a foul by Mourner on Ledi King, and it's a free kick to England. And England have scored what? Seven goals now. Is that right? Seven goals. One against France, and three against both Switzerland and Croatia. James takes the free kick. High towards Fussell. Headed away, and cleared by Simunic to the halfway line. Mourner, who's played quite well since he's come on, plays it to the right-hand side. And now Perso, moving in field. Gets the ball to the right edge of the penalty area. Serna checks. Serna has got two England defenders across the line. One of them, Ashley Cole, trips them, and it's a free kick. Despite the protests of Ashley Cole, it's a free kick to Croatia. Yeah, this could be dangerous as well, because Serna went down very quickly. I think any sort of challenge, and he is going to go down now, is a chance. We've got seven, six, two, four, six, seven players in the box here, and must defend as well. Less than 18 minutes to go. England leading 3-1. Surely they can't lose from this situation, and it's a free kick to Croatia. Two yards to the right of the penalty area, played in. Goes a long way to set it in, and it's Tudor. Firm header in, another poorly defended free kick for England, and James got nowhere near it. He had no chance. It's back to 3-2. There comes the anxiety. Here comes the worries again. It was a needlessly considered free kick. It was flighted in well, and it was Tudor that got in at the far post. Unmarked under far post. Lots of bodies in there. His firm header unsavable from David James' point of view, and it's a top corner. Good free kick. Good header. It's one of those roller coaster rides once more. From the kickoff. Here's Lampard. Towards Vasell. Down the right side, and Vasell chases after that. He can't keep it in play. It's a throw into Croatia. But do they believe in their heads that they can score twice more? I don't think so. I looked at the body language after England scored the third goal, and I didn't think so. But it may give them a bit of hope, and they've got to sort this one out. So let's see, his set-up in the room. He has delta aim at the top corner, towards Vega, and a 32- wykon-2 go. His set-up at the top corner is 1. France 2, Switzerland 1. So France currently top the group. England the second and Croatia are third. But remember, Croatia can still disturb England by winning this game at the moment. It's England 3, Croatia 2. Come on, it's all set up for you, Michael. It's all set up for you to finish this off. Here's a good header away by Terry, finding Lampard. Lampard onto Gerard inside the centre circle. Gerard comes forward. Good tackle. On Gerard by Serna and Serna finds Rosso on the far side. Thresh Hart for Croatia. Monar comes forward. Monar crosses from the right, takes an affliction, running well and then that was surely a handball. I thought a handball by Sikol inside the penalty. Not given. Clear to the halfway line, but back come Croatia and they're blue on the far side. Nice Serna. Slide it forward towards Monar, intercepted by Ashley Cole. Cole to Owen, short of the halfway line, back to Ledley King. Vasell spins through the middle. Gerard has the ball. Gerard tries to play it for Vasell. Surely he was offside. The lines were kept, he's flagged out. Anyway, he didn't get it. I think he was offside. Vasell knew he was offside, but Gerard didn't have to play that ball through. Vasell wasn't right to receive it. Beckham was on for a ball just about 10 yards to his right-hand side. That's when he got to slow it down and keep the ball. The next five minutes, they must keep it if they can. Less than a quarter of an hour to go. And like Sam, not tense but arm. Monar on the far side, who has played really well since coming on after half time. Monar slips it infield to Rosso, 30 yards from goal. And now Nikol Kovac has scored the first goal. And his pass to the right was too high, even for the everest build of Monar. And it's out of play for Ningen throwing. This is when England have got to really work their socks off. They've put a lot of effort into the match. The next five minutes have got to be vital in terms of the shape of the team. England have only got two players to mark in the midfield. They've got four players there. They've got to slide across and let the ball, if the ball does go out to the full backs of Croatia, then Beckham's got to go out and Gerard's got to go out on the other side. They've got to work hard now when we're not in possession of the ball. I hardly need to tell you. Listening to five live in the BBC. England three, Croatia two. It's head up field towards Vasell. I think he took his eye off the ball and it bounced beyond him out of play. For a throw in. Don't forget, Interactive 606. Follows this programme on five live. And also BBC One's coverage of this game. From 10 o'clock it'll be Mark Bright and Mark Lawlinson. 0-500-909-693. Gary Neville has the ball away. King should have headed further clear. Didn't. It's brought forward now. Edge of the penalty here. England beware. So caught it with a shot. A limp shot in the end. Easily saved by David James. It's very difficult when you've got four strikers to mark at the back. There's a back forward. Your man for man. Anybody that disengages from the midfield, Croatia have a man over. That's why England have got to work hard going back. Ledley King has the ball forward to Gerard and Gerard on the volley. Clips it to the left hand side. And Cole, Cole forward towards Gerard again. Gerard into the penalty here. Gerard, great run. Gerard shot. Blocked with a goalkeeper for Keener. Fantastic effort by Gerard. He cuts it back. He's got Vasell and he's also got Michael Owen for a tap in. Good side by Bettina. It's a terrific game, actually, but wasn't so nervous. Here's Olic. Olic breaking forward down the left hand side. Should he be still playing in the tournament? If he was in any other sport, he'd be banned for two years. Beckham, though, having taken up the ball after the challenge from Gary Neville. That's a great run forward by Duraz Vasell. Vasell checks. Where's Beckham? Come on, David. David takes up the ball now. Owen says, cross it to me. Instead, it's in to Frank Lampard. Do you outside the penalty here? Lampard cuts in. Lampard shoots and it's 4-2 for England. Frank Lampard makes absolutely certain. Well done. Left foot shot from 15 yards. England 4, Gratia 2. It was a wonderful break out of defense. The Gratia players have to go it. A little bit of go at Coleena for not giving the free kick in the far right hand corner. There was no free kick in the right back area for England. England then progressed forward. Spenny Horne-Erikson is talking to Gary Neville now to say, I think, just keep it. Trunk hit the ball, put it in the corners. Gratia looked dead and buried as far as their body language is concerned. But it was a wonderful play from Frank Lampard. Beckham played the ball inside. Lampard then went in. Vasell was on his right shoulder to play the ball inside the box. Use Vasell as a dummy. Came inside on his left foot. As soon as he hit the ball, it was low down to Bettina's right. 4-2, that's the goal that takes England through. You know, Sweden may have picked 5 against Bulgaria, but England are two goals clear in terms of the leading scores in the competition ground. Yeah, it's been tremendous. I mean, I would say, can we all settle down now, but you really can't with this game because if you were a neutral, you'd be saying, what a smashing game this is. To see this kind of attacking football by both sides at tournament level is very, very pleased. And England have been a credit this evening. Yeah, we don't like defensively, but generally they really have done well. Mornar gets the cross in. Deep head down towards goal, and just kept out by James. There must have been some pushing. I think there was some pushing by Nikol Korbach. All I've got to say at the moment is, come on, Switzerland. Yes, right. What about an equaliser for Switzerland? Exactly right, but it would be nice if that was to be the case, but I think England now will obviously play Greece. No, they don't play Portugal. They play Portugal. They play Portugal here in the stadium of light. That's what they play on. On Thursday. Well, work out the dates some other time. Doesn't matter. Just get through. Just get through. Just get through. It's been one of the best England performances for quite some considerable time. When there was a better England performance, we're talking about Germany away, we're talking about Turkey at home. There's been some great great England displays, but this is one of the best. Rosso to Mornar. The England penalty. Plays into the right and soon as Portschers broke. Well behind, towards the Croatian fans, who for the moment are silent. They've passionately supported the team throughout the evening. We're just seeing a replay of Frank Lampard's goal and he hit it very well. He scores so many goals in an attacking midfield role for Chelsea this season. His play demanded a place in the England starting lineup. And scores goals. That's his second of the tournament. That's right. It was a great shot. But Gerard's gone out to the left hand side. I still felt that Gerard and Lampard, that partnership, was very, very good. Ledley King's gone in there and doing a good job for him at the moment. That partnership, that axis is still a very strong one. Here's Gerard. Down the left, back to Ledley King. Lampard available, but King plays it to Cole and Cole misses that pass. It's out of play and it's a throw in. Well, they have not seen a giving up Croatia, but they know it's beyond them. They're not going to score three times in eight minutes. England lead by four goals to two and Lampard trying to win the ball he made on a corner, has he? Yes, they've linesman had in the clue, but Coleeno's absolutely sure it's a coin. I mean, the linesman's glancing all over the place. Wakey, wakey. Well, Coleeno's only 60 yards away. He knew. Corner taken short by Beckham to Lampard. Beckham again. Beckham the one really huge disappointment tonight. Now towards Ledley King. King slide the pass forward to Lampard. Back to Beckham. Beckham good pass. King wants more. Into the penalty area. Vasell is there. Vasell spins away. Back to Ledley King. Dixon in. Auln's in there. So is the goalkeeper, Bettina. And Auln tried to win the ball, but Bettina has made an absolute meal of it. And Coleeno will not be fooled. I think the Croatian players know as well. I mean, Michael Auln is not that sort of player to go in and do goalkeepers. He doesn't do that. He just tried to nick the ball, but Bettina came out. He's on his feet again. He just caught his knee, if anything. That's what the goalkeeper's saying. It's one of those situations where Michael Auln's gone in with his feet high and then put his foot down when he knows he can't make the ball. Then all of a sudden the goalkeeper's riding about on the floor. I suspect the French are safe, but we'll have no confirmation in a moment from John Murray. Here, England should be safe. And here is John Murray. It is France three. Switzerland won. Thierry Auré scored again. A lovely goal. Took the ball, ran with it into the penalty area and hit it low right for it past Yorks Steele. So Auré one becomes two for him at Euro 2004. And France leads Switzerland 3-1. Sorry, John. I don't mean to steal your thunder, but this computer-generated table is so quick, we know immediately when a goal has been scored elsewhere. So France will win the group now. England will finish second. Gerard, into Vasali's offside, and it's a free kick to Croatia. Terry. It's a bit ominous. Thierry Auré scoring two goals for the competition. It's a bit ominous for the French, if they were to get him destroyed. But I mean, Rune has been the player of the tournament so far. There's no doubt Nidhi Edd has done well for the Czech Republic. But Wayne Rune is magnificent. Substitution for England. And here's another change. Oh, and Hardreeze. Phil Neville. Phil Neville coming on for Frank Lampard. And Mike's just reminding me that Lampard is one of the England players on a yellow card. And no point in risking anything selling in these remaining minutes. And remember, at the end of the group phase, the yellow cards that picked up in those three games will be just white clean. Only a suspension would be carried over into the quarter-finals. I think Alan as well. They're the three England players that were on yellow cards. They're the three real players. Skoles, Rune and Lampard were the ones. And it's great to be able to take them off and be in that luxurious position of saying, well, we're through. Just take these players off. No problems now. The only other player. David James. I think James actually has played very well. I don't blame them for any of the goals. Either of the goals. No, he's made some crucial saves at crucial times. Vasell comes forward for England. And Vasell steps away from the defender and another defender. Well played to Rass Vasell. And then he's rather crudely brought to the ground by Simunic. Simunic plays it back. And now, not forward by Zivkovich. Zivkovich takes the return pass. We've got a little over five minutes to go. France leads Switzerland 3-1. England lead Croatia by four goals to two. Ball is kept in play in the far side by Söner. Söner crosses right foot towards the near post and is headed on by Campbell. And knocked back into the penalty area into the six-yard box by Croatia. And finally put behind by Gary Neville for a corner. I think both full backs have played really well for England. Yeah, they have. I think the whole back four has done well. I think it has. John Terry and Campbell have done well. Would have been nice to have kept a clean sheet. But it doesn't matter how you go through, as long as you do. Kobash to take the corner for Croatian front of his own fans. Played in deep. It comes James. James struts for the ball. Didn't gather at first time. Here's Monar. Monar trying to turn under his left foot. Shot goalwards. Palmed away by James. Perso with a right foot shot. And then he's going to be a good one. Well saved, James. Well, David James came amongst a whole group of bodies in towards the far post for the corner. It was one of the situations where possibly might have been better to have punched the ball. He didn't. He dropped the ball. Made one good save. The ball coming out to Perso. Another good save. Corner. Four and a half minutes to go. Kobash's corner is very deep this time towards the giant Monar. But headed away by Ledley King. Söner has a chance to get the ball into the penalty area again. On his left foot. It takes an affliction. Gulls away. A long way. And then the ball heads it clear. And it's played towards the half way line. And Zipkovich has to chase back. Hoping that Petina has goalkeeper Chombat. Petina didn't. So it's played to the right instead. And Söner with plenty of room. Crosses low. Edge of the England penalty area. Phil Neville is there. And Neville. Good clearance by Phil Neville. Oh, and first touch wasn't great. But he still has the ball. And he's got Ashley Cole in support. And Cole takes it off him. And now it's with Vasell on the far side. And Vasell, was he brought down there? The ball's out of play. It's going to be thrown into England. Oh, and taking it back to 1990. England played at Wembley against Czechoslovakia. They won 4-2 in a certain Paul Gaskell and really exploded onto the world scene there. Remember that? What relevance is that? Oh, Wenglundi. I do exactly what you've been. What are you teasing? Here's Sol Campbell, who's been outstanding in all three games for England. Hasn't he, Campbell? And King takes it up for England. England to the far side and Vasell back to Ashley Cole. And Cole steps away from Proso into Phil Neville. King, Cole. Good football from England. Into Lately King again. And now back to Beckham. King and Neville. Great passing from England. Gary Neville. Forward to Gerard. Gerard in to Phil Neville. Wouldn't this be wonderful and finished up with a goal? Gerard down the right-hand side. Oh, and Vasell wait across from Gerard and slightly overhead. Oh, and hasn't given up on it. He's going to go far side and then bundles over the defender. That's going to be a free kick. I like that. I'd love to see that. No, Fowle's been given in the far corner, but Michael Owen chasing the ball. The cross was deep from Gerard going out towards the touchline for a throw. Oh, and didn't give it up. Wendell challenge the defender. Yes, he gave the way. The free kick. He's worked very hard, Michael Owen. Yes, he hasn't scored, but he's set up goals as well. That's your job. Yes, score goals. But if you can set goals up for your partners and for other players as well, it's a team that matters. A team are going through in style tonight, which is fantastic to say. Shooter whose goal for Croatia gave us the quivers, but then Lampard putting in two goals clear again. England lead by four goals to two. Defending in the moment. That's a good ball into the England penalty area. It seemed to be a hand ball by Sokota. It didn't matter because Neville played it back to James. Gary Neville that is, and the clearance goes to the half way. Now we've got two minutes to go. Plus more than a little stop each time you feel. He's got two more substitutions in the second half. Perso shoots from long range. What a waste of space. High into the creation fans behind David James goal. What about Beckham? Yeah, he has been disappointing tonight. He hasn't really featured in the game in terms of his free kicks, in terms of his passing. I just feel sometimes he's just tuck across a bit more centrally when the plays on the other side to keep in contact with Frank Lampard and Steven Girard. But he seems to be out on the right hand side of midfield and sort of staying out there, whether the instructions have been prepared to stay out there. I'm not too sure, but he doesn't seem to take part in the game that much, which is unusual for David Beckham because he needs to be, not the fulcrum of England's play, but he needs to get on the ball a lot more. There's a file by Beckham on this occasion. It's a free kick to creation. Kovac once Beckham booked. Let the referee do his job. Will you, Nicky? Because Kaleena knows exactly what this is all about. He's going to have to do his best again, refereed, superbly. We're going to have two minutes of added time at the end of the game, which seems excessively mean in terms of the hold-ups in play. But well settled for that. Monar on the far side for Karashilev over there to being on penalty. A step over from Monar, but he doesn't lose cold. Now he turns it onto his left foot and the cross is too deep. Gary Neville chases after to the right edge of this penalty area and then fixes the ball over his left shoulder out of play for a throw-in. He's done well, Gary Neville. All the back four have done very, very well. Exceptional defending at times. Throw-in to Karashilev. Launched into the England penalty area. Perseverages. Heads it on. Mike Voldemort, now he's chasing after the ball and he can't keep it in play. It's going to be a gold kick. França beating Switzerland by three goals to one. França will top Group B and they will play Greece in the quarter-final in Lisbon on Friday night. England are going to finish the game in 30 seconds and they will play Portugal in the Lisbon quarter-final on Thursday night. How many minutes did he show three in the end, did he? I did stick two fingers up actually. Maybe you were indicating that. I thought it was two minutes, but it's three. Alright, I think that's actually right. I'll stick one extra finger up now, should I? Yeah, what we have, we've got six substitutions. You're supposed to get 30 seconds per substitution. Yes, but that's not an official rule. It's just an unofficial sort of guideline. I mean, if it was extra time, I'll have an argument. If it was extra time at the end of an England friendly, he would have about ten minutes extra time. James hits the ball upfield, Vasell rises, heads it in towards Owen, headed down by Tudor. Sherrod wins the ball. Owen waits. There's Owen, Owen into the penalty here. Can make room for the shot. Kings there. Owen wants more. Chance for a fifth surely for England. Phil Neville, right edge of the penalty here. Crosses towards Vasell. It's headed down. Beckham, he wants to get the ball in. He's got a room for the shot. Doesn't get it. Now it's played towards Sherrod down the left-hand side. Phil Neville passes. Out of play, there was a chance for Owen there. By the way, France won 3-1. It's just a screw-shade, isn't it? He just wanted to be on a plate. He's going to have to be on a plate for Michael. I don't think it's going to have to be an open goal for him to score, but that would be the icing on the cake. I think Tom's running out for him now, though. We played a minute and a half of the allotted three minutes, and unlike Charlotte, when we were as depressed as we were, England heading for the last eight of the European Championship here in Portugal 2004. Free kick goes to Peresha. A little of a run minute to go of stoppage time. Now, Russell plays the ball into the England penalty area. James keeps it in play. It's history, isn't it, Alan? The first time I've ever seen him. The first time I've ever seen him doing it in some style, although there were having a few scary moments, but it's been a wonderful performance. It's been a great collective team performance of one or two individuals not quite living up to their reputations, but it's the team that matters. It's the way that the team gets through, and particularly in going to goal down, great character, great style, driven on by Gerard, driven on by Rune in particular. Ashley Cole has been phenomenal at left back as well. It's been a great performance from England in terms of passing. The possession's been fantastic. The pressing and the pressure on the Peresha has been fantastic as well. When they've had opportunities, they've taken the goals as well, but England could have scored about eight goals tonight. Neville to Beckham, and Beckham into Fasell. Fasell just outside the penalty area. Fasell flicks the ball beyond Tudor, but then it's cleared and it's out of play, and it's going to be a throw into England. We've got about 20 seconds to go. Beckham to take the throw for England to fill Neville, back to Beckham, and Beckham crosses deep, forcing Gerard to retreat, and Gerard stretches, but he can't keep that ball in play, and it will be a throw into Peresha. I hate to have any diner on the night, especially on night when England went forward too, but Beckham has been poor. Really poor. It's not the final whistle. I can hardly hear it from Killean's lips, but it's all over, and the flush bulbs go off around the Estadio de Luz, and England are through to the quarter-finals. They've beaten Peresha by four goals for two, and let's salute Wainrundy. Two goals tonight, four goals for the tournament. The leading scorer in Portugal 2004. We'll speak to Terry Butcher and Graham Taylor shortly, but let's go straight to the Switzerland France. Can you get all the details on that French win from John Murray? Well, France have beaten Switzerland by three goals to one, so France threw, as you say, as group winners, Switzerland going home with just the one point, but they certainly provided a test here for the defending champions. Zidane headed France in front in the 20th minute from a Peres corner, but six minutes later, Johann von Lanten equalised, and in the process broke Wainrundy's record of being the youngest scorer in European Championship finals history. He's younger than Runey. He's 18 as well, and when it was 1-1, the Swiss, goodness me, they worked, they were tenacious, but eventually the French pressure in the second half paid off, and I suppose eventually, Thierry Henri has struck at Euro 2004. Sahar, who'd just come on, flicked the ball through, Henri took it down with his right foot, finished it beautifully with his left. That was 2-1 to France, and then another late goal from Henri after he ran up the Swiss defence to hit it low past York Steel, so it has finished. France three, Switzerland one, and France, group winners. France, the group winners to play Greece on Friday at the Jose Alvaloud, and on Thursday before that, Graham Taylor, England against Portugal, that is going to be some occasion, but if England played out at the seeding, then England have an even money chance, surely? Oh, they have, and I mean, you're playing the host country, so that in itself means this is another game now that you really have to be ready for. They've got a day less to do it, but quite honestly, Mark, looking at their performance today, then it takes them on. You know, when you play as you have done today and got the win, then it takes your confidence that other stage higher, so they'll be ready for that game against Portugal, no doubt. One of the supporters has just held up a life-sized cardboard cutout of Wayne Rooney with a crown on his head. I know you don't want us to go over the top, and we understand everything you've been preaching, but it's hard for people who love their football and follow their football not to get completely enthused about what Wayne Rooney has done. We've every right to be. All I'm saying about not going over the top is off the pitch. On the pitch, this, as well, this is a top footballer on the pitch, and that's where we hope that he always show what he's capable of doing. All my concern is all the time because of what comes of what he does on the pitch, will he be looked after properly off the pitch? Terry, what's the difference between England's performance this evening and the rather stuttering opening two performances we've seen from them out here? Well, I think with that early goal, if anything, they're galvanising England more than anything else. And what England had faced with the reality of the game, well, we're going to go home. If we don't score a goal here, you know, if we don't buckle ideas up, we are going to go home. Against the very, what seemed to be a very confident Croatian team, but they knuckled down, they passed the ball better when they lost the ball. They won it back very quickly by pressing the ball together as a midfield, as a striker, as defenders, and then kept it better after that. England kept the ball better tonight than I've seen them do for a long, long time. And by keeping the ball and switching the play to the opposite four backs, and by spreading the play as they did, it made Croatia work. And when Croatia won the ball, they gave it away. Or England won it back very quickly. That was the key. But they were driven by Gerard, they were driven by Runi, they were driven by a hunger and a fear of going out. And sometimes it happened, sometimes a team can score too early in terms of Croatia, which they did, but certainly galvanised England. Well, speaking more to Terry and Graham, let's hear what they made of it in the Goodison Room of Legends. They'd have enjoyed their evening there along with Mark Klemert. Yeah, we did say this was the place to beat. And I didn't think that 50 Runi lovers whooping and hollering their boys every touch. But as England fans, I guess we're not used to nights like this. The national team doing exactly what we all hope. And with a couple of Everton X, well, no, proper legends. Brian LeBone from the 60s. Derrick Mounfield from the 80s. Brian, this boy of yours, I know you see him week in week out. He delivers. It's a furry tale, isn't it? To go on there and do what he's done today, you know. I was always confident England would win even when we were won down, but that's the best football thing we played throughout the first two halves, you know, but he's unbelievable. Give him a chance and he puts it in and he made the first one for schools as well, you know. So he's a star. Has he shocked you? Well, I suppose he has doing it. He's done it every game now, hasn't he? But when I first saw him as a schoolboy three years ago, you can just see there's a fella touched with magic. And if he's not worth £50 million now, or probably more, never mind Buddy Blinken, sorry. Never mind United and Chelsea. What about Real Madrid? A quick word with Derrick Mounfield. I mean, I get there's an air of expectancy that he might just go here, that the debts need clearing. I get the impression the fans suspect he might just go. We hope he doesn't. We all well aware that he is the hottest property in Europe at the moment, and the last two games he's proved what a fantastic player he is. But we've got to be honest, Evan, the fans, we can't afford to keep it. We can't keep him. But deep down, we want him to stay. What Evan to build the team around Wayne Loonie. We've seen tonight over three games, I'm sure, how good he is. We want him to stay here. Thanks fellas. Mark, enjoyed the night. Been good fun. Excellent. Thank you very much indeed, Mark. We'll speak to Alan Kurbishly in a moment, but I do want to ask Graham Taylor about, if you like, the one black spot of the England performance this evening. And I said to you, maybe we're through the second half, David Beckham looks like he's running. Intrigal. He looks so laboured. We saw him go down the right hand side here. What's wrong? He looks tired. I mean, and I'm sure he is tired. And I wouldn't want to go too much into this, because really it is at the end of the day what he does on the football pitch. But, you know, in the last year, the move to Real Madrid, the moving away from Manchester, all of the publicity, I honestly do believe you have to be an amazing fella if that does not have an effect, if that does not drag you somewhere along the line. And to me, the performances that we've seen so far are of a tired footballer. Not someone who's not committed, not someone who doesn't care, but someone who looks physically and mentally. He looks tired. Terry? He didn't look sharp tonight, did he? Didn't look sharp at all. And the mistake that he made for the goal as well, there was a sloppy pass with his left foot when he could have turned and could have, you know, even if he executes the pass properly, he still goes to go and never, but he didn't, and then gave away the free kick that led to the first goal. It's not his fault in terms of the goal, but what he did give, he gave Croatia an opportunity to get a good ball into the box, which England didn't defend very well. But, you know, Beckham, he does, he doesn't look sharp, he looks a bit jaded. He looks off the pace again. He looked half the speed of Steven Gerrard, that's why I said to Graham, you see how Gerrard moves, and Beckham seems to be moving half the pace. Bear in mind, he's playing in a position now, which he doesn't play weak in the count anyway with Real Madrid, he plays inside. And, you know, we're not trying to make it exclusive for David Beckham, just trying to say, well, why didn't he play well? Or, you know, why does he look that way? You know, perhaps he's, perhaps, I think Graham's right in what he says, but it might be a combination of factors that he's not performing. You know, I think, but he's a player that, and yet, you know, at the end of the day, you're never going to leave out of the team, obviously, but he's a player that, if England are to progress and go all the way in this competition, he has to start to play. And if people think we're picking holes and think, oh, you shouldn't be picking holes this evening, it's because England are going to have to be at their very best, and we've talked about seven or eight out of eleven, but it may have to be eleven out of eleven when you're getting to the sharp end of a championship like this. That's why we're having this conversation now. We're not picking holes. What we are trying to say is that we know that David Beckham can play a lot better than he is doing. What do we think the reason is? What I will say is however much experience you have of the play, you still need an arm round you. You know, it doesn't matter whether you're twenty-nine, whatever David is, all the experience he has behind him, he'll know that he's not playing as well as he could do, so he needs some support. Let's have a word with Alan Kerbushy, the Charlton manager, who saw France beat Switzerland three-one this evening, so France have won that group. Alan, was that more like it from France, particularly in the second half, the sort of thing we've come to expect from them? Yeah, it was probably the right result and probably the right score line, but Switzerland made it very, very difficult for France here tonight. And especially when I got back to one-all, then in the end the class told, I think, that every time France got in the Swiss defensive, they looked like they were going to score, especially Omri. And unfortunately for Switzerland, every time they went down the other end, they sort of run out of steam and gave the ball away, so it was always going to come back. And I think it was just a question whether France would get the second goal, and then how many goals would they get? Robert Pires complained earlier in the week, Alan, that the way France were playing was suffocating to Erie Omri. Did he appear to have a little bit more latitude, a little bit more of freedom he likes? Well, it was quite interesting because they started the game off with Pires on the left and Zidane on the right, midfield. And Perez started off with a house on fire. He looked really back to form and really comfortable and happy. And Omri kept drifting out wide left, and he kept flipping the balls up and being direct like he does for Arsenal. But what happened was Zidane wouldn't stay on the right-hand side. He kept drifting around, and in all fairness, it was causing France a problem, a better side. And I think, you know, if you analyse the French performances, I think it's going to give the rest of the teams left in the quarterfinals a look that they can be got at because the right-hand side for France, they're not comfortable. Zidane won't stay there. And the left back for Switzerland kept overlapping. And, you know, against the better team, there are, of course, more problems. There are, of course, the French world problems. But I think the one thing that has happened tonight, and I know that Graham and yourself have been talking about Michael Owen because he needs a goal to get his confidence back and give him a big lift. Omri got his goals, and he looked back. He looked as if he gained an extra yard. No, he gained an extra two yards after he scored his first goal. And he was in full flow again. Beware, the Greek defenders. One final thing then, Alan, from your game. What about defensively? We talked a lot about the way that Santini went into this match with no desailles and no galas. How do they look defensively? Well, they did look a bit jittery, especially for the goal. So, especially gave the ball away a simple square pass, and he gave it away, and the Swiss broken scored. But they've lost both four backs tonight, I think. I think Sango went off in the first half with a bad arm, I think he injured his arm. And Galas replaced him, and he went off as well with a twisted ankle. So, they've got one or two problems, as self-defensively. I think if you're looking at the game, and obviously the teams that are going to be playing will analyse it. I think the way they'd be friendly at the moment is giving you a little bit of hope that you can get them. And Alan, when you see the video of this game, you'll be very pleased. I think most of all, as Graham and Terry were with their manager's hats on, with the way that England managed to keep the ball. I think from where we're sitting here, I'm quite pleased that Frank Lampard has gone and scored again. And Skoles has got in the goalscoring frame again. There's two midfield players that have got up there and scored. Michael Ein's going to score. Let's hope he's against Paul Scorne in the quarter-final. But when you're getting a healthy number of goals coming from other sources, 4-2 is a great result, and we beat Switzerland by three. So no, I think we can go into the quarter-finals with great confidence. It will be the biggest game of the tournament, I would imagine, so far. And why can't we go and win it? This boy Rooney is quite good, Alan. Well, I think we've known that. I think he's interesting as well. I think that you've just been talking about David Beckham and perhaps our tide is looking and what a long season he's had. I think if you have a look at what's happened to Wayne Rooney, he's not played too much football at all this year. I think David Moyes has either left him out or used him as a sub. And I think the appearances he's had for Everton is nowhere near perhaps what the other players at this tournament have been playing. So perhaps he's peeking and perhaps he's full of beans and nice and fresh just at the right time for his country. Alan, interesting thoughts. Thank you very much indeed. Alan Kerbischli, who's watched France beat Switzerland. And this is Garth Crooks with David Beckham. Well, David, you've got the result that you desperately wanted. Was that the best performance that we've seen from England this tournament? Definitely this tournament. I think we showed a lot of confidence, especially in the first half, even when we went one-nil down. It was all over Croatia. We were playing at football, as important as we carried on playing at football, which we did. We knew we'd break them down and with the two players up front, we're going to get goals. We looked anxious to start. What's the word about Paul Scholes? He hasn't scored for three years, you know? No, well, we all said it. Scholes, he doesn't have to score goals. He does so much more in a game than scoring a goal. But for his confidence and for him and for the lads, it's great that he's got a goal now. Hopefully we can go on from here and he can. A word about Wayne Rooney. You have to pinch yourself to remind him he's only 18. Yeah, you do. When you see him perform, nothing phases him. A big game tonight and he's produced again. He deserves all the praise he's going to get. Now we have to look ahead to Thursday. Portugal, your old friend, Louis Figo, and of course Cristiano Ronaldo. Yeah, of course. We all watched their game last night and we saw what they can do. We're well aware of what players they can produce out there. And you know, Ronaldo had a great game last night and obviously so did Louis. And it'd be nice to see him. But, you know, it's going to be a tough game. We've got two days now to rest and, you know, it's a big game. Many congratulations. Well done. That's Garth Crooks with David Beckham. Terry, what do you think about Portugal against England in the quarter-final? How did you look at that one? Well, it's going to be a cracker, isn't it? We saw Portugal get through last night against Spain. It was very nervy, very edgy. But, you know, it was pretty edgy tonight in certain circumstances, although England got through quite comfortably in the end. But yeah, I mean, there's goals written all over it, isn't there? I think so, because the way that Portugal will try and attack as well, England will try and attack. And I think they can play anything like they did tonight. I think they've got a very, very good chance of going through. But you're playing the hosts. And we've had a great support. England have had a great support here. It's the best support I've ever seen from an England team away from home. Better than the 1990 World Cup semi-finals, I feel. I mean, it's just incredible. Is that going to be the same when it comes to this same stadium against Portugal? I don't know. I would think there'd be a lot more Portuguese in here than there were Croatians here tonight. So the atmosphere is going to be fantastic. On the football front, yes, they can do it. But at the same time, Portugal will fancy their chances as well. 14 shots on goal from England this evening. 19 shots overall, Graham Taylor. Yeah, I mean, it shows what type of game it is. Everybody was enthusing about the Czech Republic, Holland, the number of shots. We've had 32 shots in all, I think, on the statistics there. So it just shows what type of game it is. It's one of the most open games I've seen at tournament level on the international scene. And both players, both teams have to be given credit for it. Let's hear from Wayne Rooney. Wayne, another great night for you. How do you do it? I don't know. Just go out there and play in my normal game. The team's doing very well today. I'm lucky enough I've got two goals. Spectacular. I could say that, but we're just going out there and trying to do our job as best as we can. Do you feel you're developing a decent understanding now with Michael Owen? Yeah, I think we've played a full well together. Obviously Michael hasn't scored tonight, but he's set a few goals for me and I think the partnership's going well. What will that goal for Paul Scholes do for his confidence? His first in three years internationally? Yeah, I think he's been looking for the Mieskole tonight. I think he's a brave header. And he's just well done, so... You've got all the headlines, Wayne. Thanks a lot. Oh, cheers. Thanks. That's Damien Johnson speaking to Wayne Rooney. Paul Scholes a goal, Terry. You probably saw his last goal in Greece, I'm sure you did. Oh, that was so long ago. You didn't even just retire. It was a long while ago. It feels like a decade ago, but it was only three years. It was a long time to wait for a goal, but Sven Jörgsen has kept faith with him in a difficult role in terms of the left-hand side and we feel that problem roll for England. But he drifted in really well. There were some lovely moves when Scholes was coming inside. Lovely one touch, linking with Rooney as well. And Michael Owen was always providing the sort of depth of the attack. Good one-touch football in the end, led to the goal. Yes, it was a brave challenge from Michael Owen on the goalkeeper. The ball popped up and then Rooney headed it goalwards and then Scholes stooped really. I mean, he's only about what, five-foot-one, but stooped to head the ball in the back of the net. I think anybody else would have broken the net to head it in, but it was right on his head and he put it in. And I think you could sense the relief, not only in four Scholes, but around the England support. But the icing on the cake would have been a goal for Michael Owen. It wasn't to be, but, you know, I am really just happy, no matter who scores. Everyone's five-foot-one when you're as tall as you are, Terry. Was it too open a game from Sven Juer and Erikson's point of view as the manager? Delighted though you are, you've won four-two. Would you actually be thinking that was just too open for my liking and looking further on into the championship? Well, he'd probably recognise that, but think that the next game is unlikely to be that. You know, although we have two sides that can attack there. You know, when you've won the game four-two and in the situation they're going one-nil down, they're through the group stage, they've done everything that was expected of them. They lose somewhat, unfortunately, two-one to France in the first game. They win the next two games with seven goals scored and two against. What more can we ask for? And I think they've done very, very well, but we mustn't get carried away. And I'm sure Sven Juer and Erikson will make sure that they don't do that. One of the things I particularly like, because there's been so much talk about Michael Owen, three minutes from the end of the game, a ball went out into the deep right-back position, in, in fact, the corner flag. And Michael Owen chased and chased that right back down. And that's what I was talking about earlier. He'll protect himself with his off-the-ball work if the supporters see that kind of reaction. He will protect himself whilst he goes through this run without scoring. And I was so pleased to see that. I thought he did so much better in this game than he had done in the previous two. Most of the stadium is empty with the England substitutes under the watchful eye of Sam Iliar just stretching their legs. Terry, I thought it was interesting as well that Steve and Jero clearly tried to set him up for a goal there. I think if it had been 0-0 or 1-1 or close, Jero would probably have had him shot himself late on there. But he was clearly trying to set up Owen because he recognises just how important confidence-wise it would be for Owen to score. Yeah, but it's one of the ones that has to be one inch out with an open goal for Michael Owen to put it in the back of the net. I mean, you know, it's not that he'll miss chances deliberately, but it's just not quite running for him. And you really feel for him. I think the whole of England feels for, for Michael Owen. And yes, it would have been the icing on the cake, but he's been setting up goals. He's linking the play well. He's on the shoulder of the last defender. He's, you know, he's that sort of target man that has to make that unselfish running work across the back for to do very well. Let's hear from Sven with Garth Crooks. Well, a magnificent performance, Sven. Can you put it into some sort of context for us? Can you explain it for us? I think we played very good football for us, Toph. We controlled everything and of course it was a pity they scored on the first free kick. They had a wide free kick, but then we took over all the game and it was only in the second half they started to create something again, creates. So good performance. I think we played as we should like to play always. And if we do like this Thursday and in the future, I think we should be very happy. You've had players like Rukos, the Palo Sosa, Baggio, talking about Wayne Rooney. He's a phenomenon. Well, what about to say about him, which has not already been said, two goals again today and fantastic goals, both of them. And I mean, he's also doing a hard work for the team. He's always dropping. It's always available. You play the ball to him and he helps us defend as well. So absolutely fantastic. You look very anxious, particularly early in the first half. Were you concerned? I was not concerned. I mean, if we play football like we did especially first half and a bit in second half, I shouldn't be concerned because sooner or later we score. Of course, you can lose games anyhow, but we can't do much more than we did first half, I think. Well, we're back here again on Thursday against Portugal. You know them very, very well. What a terrific game in prospect. Of course, it will be Portugal. They are technically very good. Pays and they did it in Spain yesterday. I saw the game and they did very well. So we have two days for rest and then back on the pitch. So we'll see. Still on course to win the tournament? Well, if we play as we did first half today, I think it's not easy to beat us. The only thing we have to cope with now is try to recover as quickly as possible after these 90 minutes today. Congratulations. Thank you. Sven Jørgen-Eckstern with Garth Crooks. 6-0-6 is around the corner with Mark Breit and Gavin Peacock coming off the bench late. Now it's time for the news with Dalia Raphael.
