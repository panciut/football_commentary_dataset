[22.16 - 27.76] P:1956.77 E:0.089257 |  15 minutes they can afford to sit tight and be patient and stay in this game
[27.76 - 34.28] P:1934.58 E:0.105765 |  the referee is Kunya Chikir from Turkey if you're looking for Olens he was the

[38.80 - 44.36] P:1830.00 E:0.093123 |  Dortmund as from the kickoff Liverpool look to go and press Barcelona and in
[44.36 - 49.24] P:1844.07 E:0.088599 |  the program notes tonight from Jurgen Klopp the message was as follows this
[49.24 - 57.28] P:1880.09 E:0.085588 |  Liverpool never stops this Liverpool never quits we don't do if only well
[57.32 - 62.00] P:1906.68 E:0.102350 |  we will find out if Liverpool can produce it however Messi comes forward
[62.00 - 66.64] P:1924.70 E:0.099904 |  now he might have something to say in the opening seconds but he stopped and
[66.64 - 70.80] P:1913.55 E:0.102795 |  it was a challenge by Robertson Messi's only now getting himself to the floor
[70.80 - 75.52] P:1939.52 E:0.099664 |  as Milner will play it forward Liverpool playing from right to left
[75.52 - 81.72] P:1904.41 E:0.104055 |  Mane listen to the Anfield crawl route raw early chance just nicked away from

[86.00 - 90.72] P:1874.36 E:0.107918 |  from Liverpool gone from the off lovely run from Mane into a reagan we just
[90.72 - 94.76] P:1873.08 E:0.095007 |  go Henderson was going to stretch that leg out there but just past him corner
[94.76 - 97.24] P:1898.51 E:0.109187 |  Liverpool
[97.64 - 103.52] P:1851.19 E:0.096551 |  they said they'd have to take it step by step he talked about celebrating this

[107.68 - 111.88] P:1889.88 E:0.107434 |  supporters are doing their bit with the lungs the Liverpool players with their
[112.04 - 116.44] P:1946.99 E:0.101880 |  legs Messi is still having a word with Robertson from the way that he was
[116.44 - 120.68] P:2001.84 E:0.102907 |  stopped for that early break away for Barcelona and the Turkish referee has
[120.68 - 124.44] P:1983.46 E:0.097926 |  prevented the corner kick from being taken and he's having a word with
[124.44 - 129.04] P:1955.95 E:0.098788 |  Messi and Robertson who are still having a war of words yeah when Robertson Messi
[129.04 - 132.80] P:1986.25 E:0.100902 |  thought he was fouled by Robertson stood on the ground and just as Robertson
[132.80 - 137.24] P:1965.99 E:0.111102 |  was walking past him he put his hand on his shoulder whether he said something
[137.28 - 140.48] P:1909.18 E:0.115069 |  too many zero not but Messi clearly wasn't happy with that
[143.92 - 149.08] P:1908.52 E:0.113006 |  it is definitely inside Anfield corner kick for Liverpool far side the right
[149.08 - 153.76] P:1926.30 E:0.096524 |  and it goes towards the near post the Vino tried to meet it Suarez then will
[153.76 - 158.44] P:1997.99 E:0.094921 |  clear that ball away only as far as Henderson and Henderson goes back to

[170.20 - 174.88] P:1869.18 E:0.090411 |  the Cop End so they'll be attacking the Cop End in the second half just as they
[174.88 - 180.84] P:1877.42 E:0.092288 |  were against Borussia Dortmund three years ago but into Milan in 65 San
[180.84 - 187.24] P:1875.04 E:0.099070 |  Etienne in 77 Olympiacos Chelsea there have been unforgettable nights at Anfield
[187.24 - 193.76] P:1920.00 E:0.092605 |  but it would probably top the lot if they could add Barcelona in 2019 to that
[193.80 - 200.72] P:1868.51 E:0.083058 |  list of unforgettable nights here on this famous ground van Dyck to Matty just

[214.40 - 217.88] P:1962.36 E:0.097673 |  booed because of his Manchester United connections and it runs off the head of
[217.88 - 222.08] P:1952.77 E:0.089091 |  Matty and back to Allison Alan Shearer it's not as well when Liverpool have the
[222.44 - 226.12] P:1944.77 E:0.093564 |  ball they're just took and continued in that left-hand side there to try and
[226.12 - 229.80] P:1897.94 E:0.095175 |  make it a four in midfield rather than the three to make that extra number in

[253.88 - 260.36] P:2007.53 E:0.087668 |  Matty forward ball Shaqiri David left foot try to play it forward but it went
[260.36 - 265.44] P:1985.22 E:0.090967 |  behind Mane and to Steggen will clear but it's been a very lively start both
[265.44 - 271.32] P:2085.81 E:0.097891 |  on and off the pitch four minutes played no no Roberto will go back to Steggen
[271.32 - 275.00] P:2087.28 E:0.102867 |  I thought Shaqiri would have been better I'm having a shot there you know you
[275.00 - 279.48] P:1909.73 E:0.103552 |  tried to pick his head up and clear the pass instead of a perfect goal 20-22

[297.84 - 304.60] P:1959.26 E:0.085936 |  Eureki and Mane in the absence of Firmino and Salah hoping that Salah will be
[304.64 - 311.52] P:1943.01 E:0.083653 |  back for the final day the five live will bring you all the drama Manchester City
[311.52 - 316.00] P:1927.50 E:0.101139 |  95 points Liverpool 94 what a Titanic tussle that has been Manchester City
[316.00 - 320.48] P:1905.59 E:0.087949 |  right Liverpool are at home to walls that's on Sunday but this is the
[320.48 - 325.16] P:1952.29 E:0.098614 |  Champions League and it's live on five live the ball is bowled out by Allison
[325.16 - 328.20] P:1806.31 E:0.096975 |  the bearded goalkeeper all in gray Robertson plays it forward on this
[328.20 - 332.56] P:1868.23 E:0.091818 |  near side the left PK right behind Mane stabs it out of play for a throw that
[332.60 - 337.16] P:1967.70 E:0.082866 |  Liverpool want to take quickly Milner will leave it to Robertson we've been
[337.16 - 340.32] P:1972.21 E:0.078746 |  playing for just over five minutes
[340.32 - 345.84] P:1883.87 E:0.094285 |  Fabina out to Mane on this near side the left level of the penalty area that
[345.84 - 349.68] P:1930.26 E:0.108951 |  doubled upon him challenge comes in from Vidal behind for a corner kick Liverpool
[349.68 - 353.04] P:2025.47 E:0.100277 |  and that was good from Allison you know when he collects that ball there you get
[353.04 - 357.24] P:1982.62 E:0.087763 |  it and he fizzes that ball out to the to the full back with pace on it just to
[357.24 - 362.12] P:1786.74 E:0.098027 |  keep momentum going and they go straight up through the end and get the corner
[362.48 - 367.44] P:1849.80 E:0.104315 |  cries of Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool as Alexander Arnold the young England
[367.44 - 371.72] P:1972.77 E:0.086445 |  international comes across to this near side the left to take it in front of the
[371.72 - 376.64] P:2003.80 E:0.086855 |  travelling section of support from Barcelona look how crowded that six yard
[376.64 - 382.68] P:2011.65 E:0.090141 |  area is there is a clutch of Lumina shirts there's four red shirts in there as
[382.68 - 387.40] P:1885.40 E:0.080034 |  well as it's played in towards the near post from Alexander Arnold the corner
[387.56 - 392.16] P:1944.22 E:0.078375 |  Henderson tries to play it back to him interception from Raketic sliding and
[392.16 - 397.40] P:1962.74 E:0.080989 |  then Milner inside the centre circle back to Allison just outside the D of his
[397.40 - 402.56] P:1864.24 E:0.088404 |  penalty area at the cop ended anfield six minutes played nil nil Shaqiri
[402.56 - 408.24] P:1884.65 E:0.092054 |  collects a diagonal ball goes in field to Matty Robertson is on the outside of him
[408.24 - 412.16] P:1925.52 E:0.093606 |  on this near side Matty though with a diagonal ball Mane has popped up on the
[412.16 - 416.00] P:1917.38 E:0.108512 |  right actually gets there Mane nixon inside Henderson into the penalty area
[416.12 - 423.96] P:1882.11 E:0.121959 |  Henderson on the corner up Oregi the black stays down and Liverpool have made the perfect start
[423.96 - 430.96] P:1886.42 E:0.121373 |  inside seven minutes that's the only goal they wanted they lead by a goal to nil it's Oregi
[430.96 - 437.04] P:1868.53 E:0.109075 |  what a start for Liverpool if you thought this place was rocking before and listen to it now
[437.04 - 442.76] P:1905.50 E:0.105291 |  a crossfield ball from Fabino who then finds Henderson in there thought he'd fluff the chance
[443.04 - 448.04] P:1916.17 E:0.105526 |  Keefer makes a good save Oregi tucks it into the back of the net they're going crazy
[449.88 - 452.76] P:1738.68 E:0.123460 |  it will be checked as a matter of course by VAR
[455.16 - 460.76] P:1917.99 E:0.111929 |  but the goal stands and Liverpool have the start that they wanted
[461.80 - 467.88] P:1919.33 E:0.101048 |  Divock Oregi they're on the attack again Milner to Mane you think
[468.84 - 474.04] P:1864.81 E:0.108622 |  it was brilliant play from Mane you know because he read the poor header from Alba I think it was
[474.04 - 478.04] P:1985.90 E:0.096258 |  he tried to head it back but he intercepted that and he kept that ball moving
[479.32 - 484.04] P:2013.04 E:0.104305 |  and Oregi on the follow-up from Tishtegan who just couldn't keep it out from Henderson
[485.08 - 486.84] P:1921.59 E:0.135113 |  Liverpool lead by a goal to nil
[488.68 - 493.40] P:1923.39 E:0.115482 |  Suarez though is on the attack running forward over on that far side Matty comes across
[494.36 - 501.08] P:1899.44 E:0.101829 |  Liverpool have a goal the crucial factor is they still have to deny Barcelona from scoring
[501.80 - 506.20] P:1931.60 E:0.105865 |  because one goal for Barcelona and Liverpool then will require five
[509.40 - 514.68] P:2005.34 E:0.102528 |  but in terms of making the perfect start Liverpool have just produced it
[515.64 - 518.76] P:1993.64 E:0.099269 |  didn't Suarez seems going to be respectful in front of the cop
[518.84 - 523.32] P:1915.18 E:0.086790 |  and the left can not change its spots
[525.56 - 532.12] P:1966.01 E:0.106559 |  so Liverpool lead by a goal to nil they trail 3-1 on aggregate corner kick though for Barcelona
[532.12 - 538.68] P:1982.28 E:0.094455 |  over on that far side in front of the cop in it goes Shakira on the edge of the area
[538.68 - 544.52] P:1929.68 E:0.098134 |  has sliced his clearance touched forward by Alexander Arnal Mane Mane's been everywhere
[544.52 - 549.88] P:1872.87 E:0.110483 |  he's been on the left he's been on the right Oregi might off as the back pass went to Tishtegan
[550.76 - 556.60] P:1887.37 E:0.108121 |  Oregi and he put out an outstretched thought Matty got there Shakiri Liverpool have momentum
[557.40 - 564.04] P:1904.17 E:0.085155 |  Henderson far side the right they've just got to keep their composure
[564.92 - 568.68] P:1939.64 E:0.105395 |  but they lead by a goal to nil I thought Oregi could have stuck his foot out there you know
[568.68 - 572.52] P:1841.94 E:0.102147 |  I didn't got that there was a terrible back pass I just thought I don't know why he didn't
[575.16 - 582.44] P:1771.46 E:0.100995 |  well I spoke to many people in the football world over the last few days and I said if it could happen
[583.08 - 588.76] P:1804.25 E:0.083648 |  there's one place where you would say it wouldn't it be Anfield and certainly in these opening nine
[588.76 - 594.44] P:1898.34 E:0.100342 |  minutes or so they are threatening to produce the unexpected as Mane cuts forward goes down
[594.44 - 599.40] P:1861.17 E:0.105587 |  he's told to get up by the Turkish referee Kunik Shakir went down a little bit too easily
[599.64 - 606.68] P:1927.31 E:0.090583 |  Liverpool pick up the loose ball Liverpool at the minute though Alan are winning every ball
[606.68 - 612.28] P:1939.80 E:0.093390 |  they are so superior and sharper and and that ball there that van Dijk has been a key already
[612.28 - 618.84] P:1866.96 E:0.098450 |  there's been one from Mattyp and then another one from there from from van Dijk that got Liverpool
[618.84 - 624.52] P:1977.61 E:0.090864 |  in there in front and they also when Oregi chased that back pass down that was also a long ball
[625.24 - 630.04] P:1948.04 E:0.088486 |  ball drilled out from that far side Alexander Arnald who's still stayed out on this near side the
[630.04 - 637.24] P:1958.09 E:0.090779 |  left couldn't keep it in play is that a permanent switch at the minute they don't seem willing to
[637.24 - 642.44] P:2017.87 E:0.109017 |  to change do they Alexander Arnald stayed on the left and and Robertson the left back on the right
[643.64 - 648.28] P:1947.81 E:0.098605 |  here is Suarez challenge comes in from Fabinho what a challenge that was
[649.00 - 651.64] P:1951.49 E:0.107859 |  was always got a yellow card for it
[655.32 - 660.84] P:1935.02 E:0.105801 |  70 possession for Liverpool in these early stages I thought that was a hard but a fair challenge
[660.84 - 665.56] P:1893.81 E:0.103406 |  you know Suarez went into it also aggressively rolling over
[667.96 - 671.32] P:1983.67 E:0.100420 |  he got the ball it was firm very firm
[672.12 - 675.16] P:1902.72 E:0.085854 |  but but it looks a fair challenge
[677.24 - 681.16] P:1878.64 E:0.103253 |  Fabinho however has been booked for that challenge on Suarez
[682.44 - 686.04] P:1835.97 E:0.103813 |  tell you what Suarez certainly felt the effects of it didn't it welcome back to Anfield
[687.24 - 688.92] P:1879.72 E:0.122615 |  and a couple of rules over as well
[690.68 - 692.20] P:1893.78 E:0.112004 |  but walking perfectly now
[693.48 - 699.72] P:1936.64 E:0.110852 |  Anfield rocking BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Mercy side Liverpool lead by a goal to Neil
[700.44 - 702.84] P:1980.04 E:0.102800 |  we've been playing for just over 11 minutes
[704.92 - 711.80] P:1891.26 E:0.100642 |  Barcelona have won 38 of 42 UEFA ties when they've won the first leg at home
[712.76 - 717.80] P:2031.60 E:0.098834 |  I wasn't good at maths at school so at the aid of a calculator I've worked out that that is a 90%
[717.80 - 724.12] P:2064.55 E:0.094772 |  success ratio you could say that's a 10 success chance for Liverpool but then you're missing
[724.20 - 729.48] P:1982.91 E:0.093318 |  Firmino and Salah does it reduce that they haven't told these Liverpool players
[730.28 - 734.76] P:1965.66 E:0.092069 |  because if they want to fail in the most beautiful way they have certainly started that
[734.76 - 737.48] P:1893.72 E:0.097337 |  in these opening 12 minutes as they lead by a goal to Neil
[739.16 - 743.00] P:1871.34 E:0.089491 |  and all of a sudden they can get our breath because it's a goal kick to Barcelona
[743.56 - 750.12] P:1954.11 E:0.099435 |  Aurelius goal after seven minutes for Liverpool and that's why these Liverpool supporters still
[750.12 - 755.72] P:1927.88 E:0.098383 |  believe to Steggen to take the goal kick looks to go right down the middle they've pulled it
[755.72 - 761.48] P:1914.82 E:0.092275 |  out of play it'll be a Liverpool throw on that far side you see even at 1-0 at half time attacking
[761.48 - 767.08] P:1903.03 E:0.074752 |  the cop end it's still on isn't it it's still on because they haven't conceded yet we said
[767.88 - 771.56] P:1925.24 E:0.097158 |  it was a brilliant opportunity for them because they know they'd go after
[772.28 - 777.00] P:1924.16 E:0.103319 |  after Barcelona and close them down they did exactly that and the crowd reacted to them as well

[1795.40 - 1799.96] P:1812.86 E:0.090527 |  there hasn't been too much opportunity for that for what has been a breathless
[1800.60 - 1806.52] P:1921.39 E:0.089821 |  first 30 minutes here at Anfield and in this stoppage Jürgen Klaup is having a word with
[1806.52 - 1815.64] P:1910.11 E:0.090948 |  his left tenant James Milner down in front of us and what's it going to be is it going to be a drop ball
[1817.72 - 1820.84] P:1894.66 E:0.111956 |  Barcelona have to give it back to Liverpool because Liverpool had possession
[1821.64 - 1827.24] P:1925.93 E:0.093165 |  so it is knocked back by Rakitic and Alisson will chest the ball forward

[1847.64 - 1854.36] P:1940.29 E:0.087567 |  nice little turn runs into trouble loses the ball Barcelona with Busquets turns and Alba will
[1854.36 - 1860.60] P:1901.74 E:0.068541 |  clear Henderson has stayed down and therefore there is another stoppage in play and that's the
[1860.60 - 1864.76] P:1969.94 E:0.084648 |  last thing that Liverpool would want because he and the fact that's just he's shaking his head
[1864.76 - 1869.64] P:1857.90 E:0.084268 |  Jürgen Klaup muttering to himself because he knows that he can't afford another injury
[1870.68 - 1874.68] P:1914.65 E:0.095973 |  and not when you've got the energetic Henderson being that driving force from midfield but
[1874.76 - 1878.92] P:1888.40 E:0.082920 |  Henderson's not moving but it was good play from him in a riggy and good interplay between the
[1878.92 - 1884.28] P:1937.36 E:0.093996 |  both of them little one two give and go and he just overruns it just Henderson and catches gets caught
[1884.28 - 1892.12] P:1683.22 E:0.080872 |  on the on the knee a little bit late so Henderson is getting treatment
[1894.92 - 1901.00] P:1889.59 E:0.079417 |  and Jürgen Klaup will be anxiously watching on by now then would be the natural replacement
[1901.72 - 1905.88] P:1853.19 E:0.084395 |  because the other substitutes Brewster and Woodburn very young
[1906.76 - 1913.24] P:1924.79 E:0.080910 |  Sturridge Gomez and Lovren so Vinaldo would be the one in fact Vinaldo is already taking off his
[1913.24 - 1916.04] P:1926.36 E:0.090751 |  training top so Vinaldo is getting stripped and ready for action
[1917.56 - 1921.64] P:1886.03 E:0.067860 |  that the fact that he didn't move was an ominous sign wasn't it Alan?
[1921.64 - 1927.48] P:1928.13 E:0.083390 |  Yeah he was um as I said he just overrun that that ball so he's lunging into to get the tackle
[1927.72 - 1931.64] P:1840.70 E:0.085611 |  and I thought it was Langley that caught him late because he just got to the ball before him
[1932.92 - 1937.56] P:2008.41 E:0.093486 |  but we said Liverpool would get chances in the in the game they have they've got one goal could
[1937.56 - 1943.00] P:1964.44 E:0.088386 |  have had another one but for for a couple of decent saves they've had to rely on their goalkeeper

[3067.08 - 3071.32] P:2126.35 E:0.104760 |  was running in behind and they still couldn't handle them and also a Rigi I think a Rigi's been

[3106.28 - 3111.08] P:1697.51 E:0.103661 |  reward for it in a different way but similarly to it the new camp Liverpool have had their
[3111.08 - 3116.84] P:1793.94 E:0.102120 |  opportunities in this game however we've seen that Barcelona can still hurt them it's not
[3116.84 - 3121.08] P:1837.95 E:0.103822 |  by any means in in Liverpool's hands this this time but Barcelona are not going to change the
[3121.08 - 3126.44] P:1944.97 E:0.102915 |  way they play they want to score a goal I mean in the last minute of the half there you've got

[3388.44 - 3393.32] P:1775.89 E:0.078118 |  got a brilliant goal John you obviously didn't know that because i'm sure you would have said
[3393.32 - 3400.12] P:1636.74 E:0.076829 |  but we know he beat a good young iAX team and you know we we talk about this iAX team now who are a
[3400.12 - 3406.52] P:1654.74 E:0.076530 |  step up from you know they had the likes of van der Vart a ibra a young ibra was there so no they
[3406.52 - 3411.24] P:1699.67 E:0.076379 |  were a good team back then different Ketler fish now though absolutely wonderful team and i mean
[3411.24 - 3416.68] P:1772.66 E:0.074930 |  this would this would be an absolute fairy tale story you know if iX could go all the way i think
[3416.68 - 3421.56] P:1746.58 E:0.082556 |  i was reading last season in the champions league they got knocked out in in the qualifying
[3421.56 - 3427.40] P:1582.73 E:0.077289 |  round against Nice and they didn't even get into the Europa League i think Rosenberg beat them in
[3427.40 - 3434.44] P:1737.34 E:0.075502 |  in the Europa qualifier so it tells you in such a short space of time you know how they have improved
[3434.44 - 3439.16] P:1459.23 E:0.076220 |  and they've been the story of this season so far but can they see it through yeah well even this
[3439.16 - 3445.48] P:1809.19 E:0.078308 |  season they started out in this competition on the 25th of July and here they are one match away
[3445.48 - 3452.04] P:1592.66 E:0.071660 |  from the final but as far as Tottenham are concerned there are more injury worries there's no
[3452.04 - 3456.44] P:1681.36 E:0.093206 |  Davenson Sanchez here he's the latest one to join the injury list obviously no Harry Kane
[3457.00 - 3463.48] P:1705.45 E:0.089463 |  Serge Aurier is not here Eric Lamella is here he's been able to train and as for Jan Fautongan
[3463.48 - 3470.12] P:1774.74 E:0.067590 |  after he took that clattering last week he is going to be involved and Mauricio Pochettino the
[3470.12 - 3474.84] P:1714.97 E:0.073269 |  Tottenham manager explained to us that he will be wearing a face mask but this is what he had to
[3474.84 - 3483.24] P:1712.89 E:0.090895 |  say about Jan Fautongan's condition today he didn't suffer nothing wrong more than he cut in his nose
[3483.24 - 3490.76] P:1719.76 E:0.072923 |  it's no more than than that it's a lot of player playing play and keep playing with the same situation
[3490.76 - 3497.48] P:1908.36 E:0.086012 |  you know and it's not a big issue wasn't a big issue if tomorrow is fit and we believe that
[3499.24 - 3503.56] P:1323.58 E:0.096984 |  that we want to give the possibility to play i think it's ready to play it's not a problem
[3503.56 - 3509.40] P:1817.39 E:0.070662 |  i think he don't need a mask but it's not a it wasn't a big issue so it looks as though
[3509.40 - 3515.64] P:1644.92 E:0.074752 |  Jan Fautongan is going to be involved no question about that it would seem uh and highly significantly
[3515.64 - 3519.96] P:1658.68 E:0.084080 |  from a Tottenham point of view Son Hyeong-min is able to play having missed the first leg through
[3519.96 - 3525.88] P:1691.23 E:0.068188 |  suspension yeah i think in terms of Son he was missed badly uh you know in that first leg he's
[3525.88 - 3531.00] P:1737.43 E:0.085685 |  such a versatile player uh you know a goal scorer a real threat so that's a massive
[3531.72 - 3537.08] P:1861.28 E:0.075038 |  boost for Spurs and Fautongan of course when i have to say when uh you know when he nearly
[3537.08 - 3541.08] P:1789.11 E:0.077834 |  collapsed last week you know coming off the pitch and i thought you know that that's him done is
[3541.08 - 3545.96] P:1782.87 E:0.071560 |  not going to make this leg but um you know they've obviously made the decision um you know it's good
[3545.96 - 3551.88] P:1775.20 E:0.078008 |  to see he is okay and is an experienced player and they will need all his experience uh tomorrow night
[3551.88 - 3557.48] P:1826.46 E:0.078943 |  Maurizio Pochettino said uh today that he felt that Ajax in the first 30 minutes of the first leg
[3557.48 - 3562.84] P:1566.15 E:0.078309 |  were very very good he said they were dynamic they had energy he said our approach was bad
[3563.64 - 3569.40] P:1741.18 E:0.072020 |  and he talked today about how in the second leg here they need to play with more freedom
[3570.12 - 3576.04] P:1799.92 E:0.061479 |  do you do you think that he will have worked out a way to win this match and get through
[3577.32 - 3583.40] P:1779.54 E:0.079153 |  yes i look you know i think he talked about the lack of intensity in the first uh game but i
[3583.40 - 3588.84] P:1902.48 E:0.072076 |  actually thought Pochettino's uh Maurizio Pochettino's tactics he got them wrong uh with the three at
[3588.84 - 3594.84] P:1835.23 E:0.078410 |  the back when he changed Tottenham were a lot more comfortable so Soco uh came on and had a really
[3594.84 - 3599.48] P:1897.61 E:0.084310 |  strong game Tottenham are still well in this time it's it's half time they're a they're a goal behind
[3599.48 - 3604.52] P:1844.04 E:0.070666 |  we know they have goals uh in this team and you know the pressure's off in many respects unless
[3604.52 - 3610.28] P:1831.76 E:0.077525 |  there's a miracle uh you know at the weekend Tottenham have secured their champions league spot anyway
[3610.28 - 3615.80] P:1653.59 E:0.069078 |  so it's all it's all in they have to go all in now have a listen to this this was a little a little
[3615.80 - 3621.32] P:1626.24 E:0.082171 |  bit bizarre really in the in the media conference this afternoon when Maurizio Pochettino was asked
[3621.32 - 3628.28] P:1574.32 E:0.075262 |  how it would feel if he were to win the champions league this season it should be fantastic no close
[3628.84 - 3638.12] P:1448.82 E:0.062337 |  five-year chapter and go home was that a joke or it's not a joke why sorry that that makes it sound
[3638.12 - 3643.16] P:1281.23 E:0.082477 |  like you would maybe leave Tottenham if you won the champions league that that would be your work done
[3643.16 - 3650.92] P:1117.34 E:0.102285 |  yes or maybe i work with Daniel setting you know working in different for sure to win the champion
[3650.92 - 3657.00] P:1337.65 E:0.095656 |  league with Tottenham in the circumstance this season maybe i need to think a little bit maybe
[3657.72 - 3662.84] P:1802.52 E:0.084375 |  to do something different in the future so that was all a little bit strange Chris and i must say
[3663.40 - 3668.20] P:1536.35 E:0.075988 |  what we've done there is edit together all the pertinent points it was it was all sort of said
[3668.20 - 3673.16] P:1825.45 E:0.081090 |  over a period of time Maurizio Pochettino was smiling at one stage hence the question
[3673.88 - 3678.68] P:1353.34 E:0.083242 |  from Matt Law as the Daily Telegraph there about whether he was joking it was a little bit
[3678.68 - 3684.76] P:1659.61 E:0.069576 |  difficult to know what exactly he was talking about yeah i mean my reading of that and you were
[3684.76 - 3691.24] P:1833.87 E:0.083412 |  there of course and could see his you know his his facial expressions this that and the other my
[3691.24 - 3697.00] P:1841.36 E:0.080725 |  reading of that was his him saying i couldn't better this this season with this spurs team you
[3697.00 - 3701.72] P:1797.83 E:0.086145 |  know they have been stretched they didn't bring players in in the summer this would be the absolute

[3809.56 - 3815.96] P:1914.64 E:0.097899 |  have punished liverpool um so that wouldn't surprise me um that if he wanted if he didn't come out
[3815.96 - 3821.00] P:1841.85 E:0.096071 |  at halftime or two if he was going to be another 10 or 15 minutes on the pitch then it would be a

[3832.36 - 3838.36] P:1994.75 E:0.112612 |  could be that he makes an appearance in the second half the barcelona players are already out as they
[3838.36 - 3844.68] P:1834.60 E:0.106476 |  make their way over to the top end of anfield they're lining up their goalkeeper test steg and

[3859.08 - 3864.04] P:1945.91 E:0.100800 |  team valentira and leon denis well shakiri is out there henderson is out there i wondered if
[3864.04 - 3868.04] P:1965.84 E:0.087002 |  henderson's knee injury that he picked up that knock was not going to make him come out for the
[3868.04 - 3873.24] P:1937.85 E:0.087999 |  second half with vinaldom stripped and ready for action the player who hasn't come out is robertson
[3873.96 - 3880.12] P:1966.03 E:0.087524 |  so millner looks like he's going to fill in at left back for vinaldom to replace robertson
[3880.92 - 3888.28] P:1999.31 E:0.096697 |  so that is indeed the liverpool change so andrew robertson unable to start the second half
[3889.16 - 3894.04] P:1925.93 E:0.106194 |  as liverpool now with half allison in goal a back four of alexander arnold matty van dyke
