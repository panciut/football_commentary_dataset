  "transcript": " Bobby, a good tempo of play. I watched Holland, I watched Brazil. They play at a high tempo with great quality. And that's what England haven't been able to do. While the referee from Algeria, Jamal Hamoudi, has blown his whistle. We're under way here in beautiful Belo Horizonte. There are some fluffy white clouds overhead, but it's a mainly blue sky. I don't know what the temperature is, but if this is winter, we'll take this. England all in white today, Costa Rica in their red shirts, blue shorts and red socks. And it's 23 degrees centigrade. And it says on Alistair Yolmins' floaties of producer, it's a sunny day. Confirmed. You're listening to Five Live, your World Cup station, because whatever happens to England, and we know they're going home, we'll be following everything that matters in Brazil 2014, taking you through to the climax in the Madagascar Stadium. It's about three weeks away, something like that. So England are playing, I think, a 4-3-3, Danny. I think it's where you're clearly back four. 4-4-1-1 perhaps. Maybe Alain on the left-hand side. Milder's playing in a central position at the moment. But I think it will change slightly. But I think maybe it's a 4-4-1-1, as we talked about. Maybe packing that midfield a little bit more, giving it a little bit of protection. Will Shearer and Lampard in the centre. Milder on the right-hand side. And Barclay just off storage. Ben Foster drilled a clearance high towards La Lanna, who headed on towards storage, but it's cleared by Costa Rica. And then Costa Rica pick up possession. Brenes into Campbell, just outside the England penalty. The shot takes an affliction, and it's wide. Or did it take an affliction? A level-water, the goal kick. I think Costa Rica right to complain. I think they should have had a corner there. I can't believe that's not been given as a corner. It comes off the back of Gary Cahill. Clear deflection. How the referee's missed that, I don't know. But already you can see Costa Rica, a team with confidence. They're zipping the ball around, letting's get the ball and make things happen. England look a little bit nervous. A little bit jittery at the moment. No surprise there, unfortunately, given what's happened here. But who would have expected Costa Rica to beat Uruguay and Italy? Phenomenal performance from the Central American side. England have the ball, though, on the far side of the field. And now it's slipped to the left side towards Luxor. Luxor is the future at left back. We hope, we think. Luxor plays it to his club colleague, LaLana. Close to the corner flag. And then LaLana runs it out of play. And it will be a throw in to Costa Rica. They were comfortably runners up in their ConquerCaf group to the United States. But it's one thing to be tight defensively. They've got so many players based in so-called mediocre clubs overseas. No one can expect Costa Rica to have played this well. In what wars, allegedly, the group of death? It was a very, very tough group. I said at the beginning, Costa Rica will come up with a surprise against somebody. I didn't think it would be against two teams. I thought they could pull off a result. It always happens in World Cups. You think when Cameroon's at first joined in the World Cup, that naivety sometimes does nique your goal and nique your result. I'm more concerned today about England. I'm looking for a style of play, a way of moving forward. What sort of game are England going to take? We've talked about philosophy. I want to see what the philosophy is. Is it going to be a slow passing game, possession game? Is it going to be more dynamic, get the ball forward quickly or play on the counter attack? Frank Lampard winning his 106th and final cap for his country today. What a great servant he's been as well. Sure. Back now to Chris Smalling. Smalling. And then chips it straight out of play. He wasn't under any pressure. That's poor. Throw into Costa Rica just short of the halfway line near side of the field. Not a good start from Smalling there. That'll do him no confidence at all. First few moments in a game, you want to have a good touch. You want to get hold of the ball. A couple of simple passes. You're a defender, get a header, a tackle. Something like that. When you give the ball away, it plays in your mind for the next five or ten minutes. From the throwing that was squandered by Costa Rica, it was given away by Wilshire for England. Costa Rica have a free kick. It's played towards the far side of the field. Towards Diaz. That comes to the right side again. Duarte, one of the three central defenders. He's up towards the halfway line. Into the captain, Brian Ruiz. On loan from Fulham to Fias behind. Now the play switches to the far side again. The ball played deep into the England penalty area. Too deep, thankfully. It's over the crossbar and behind for the goal kick. But England haven't started well. It's just a little bit too easy for Costa Rica at the moment. England have got to get tighter. You've got to put pressure on the ball. The player who's got the ball under control, you've got to get close enough to get his head down. I'm sorry, but in this case, two or three yards isn't close enough. You've got to get within a yard of a player to affect him because players are better than they used to do. If you give a player two or three yards, as you see there, they can ping the ball all over the place. England, of course, have been far from good during this World Cup. But I do think that results have been worse than performance. Some things have just gone against them when they badly needed to go for them. Now they're on the attack in the far side of the field. It breaks down as Milner loses possession. It's drilled towards Ruiz. The captain, Ruiz Tackle, loses it to La Havana. La Havana, the other. Is that once you're done again? Yeah, he just got caught on a follow-through in the back. But this is the problem, I think, with Jack Wilshere. He goes down after nearly every single challenge. And he immediately looks hurt. He's holding, he's clutching the back of his right thigh at the moment. But he's out of the game at the moment, too. Six minutes gone here in Belo Horizonte. I know it's wrong, Alan, but is the sort of play you'd be thinking, you know what, if I get the chance, I'm going to get a decent Tackle in early on. You know, possibly leave a little bit on him, you know, and see how he reacts to that. Campbell takes the ball and then he gives it away. And Wilshere restored to health, we think, back to La Havana, deep inside his own half. La Havana switches it to the far side of the field. That was cut out of each of the backbears. And then one back-buying over the foot was a bit high, according to the Algerian referee. And it's a free kick to Costa Rica. Probably get away with that in the Premier League. Phil Jones just came in, studs showing. Both players went for the ball, but Diaz had his foot, his studs pointing downwards. Jones just started pointing up. And as we've all seen in European international football, that's always likely to be a free kick. Now, Campbell, the Arsenal player, is on loan to Olympiacus. He'll take the free kick. It's about 40 yards of mean and goal. Slightly to the left as he plays it in left footed, straight into the grateful hands of Ben Foster. And Foster throws it out to Shaw. Shaw surges towards the half way line. Chips it over the half way line. Barclay's there, the first touch from Barclay. Not great, but he flayed it off a Costa Rican player. And it's out of Diaz for a throw into England, deep inside the Costa Rican half. In the small sliver of shadow cast by the roof of this stadium, Shaw throws it back into the sunshine, back towards Smalling, just over the half way line. Smalling hits it to the far side to his Manchester United colleague, Jones Jones. Pass forward to Sturridge. It was awfully difficult for Sturridge to take, but he was fouled anyway by Roy Miller, and it's a free kick to England. Taken and played to Wilshire. So, it's fired in really hard into Sturridge's feet from Phil Jones. Almost had no chance to control that, and fortunate, I think, to get the free kick in the end. Here's Wilshire following the free kick, and that's a pass over hit. Welfare on Sturridge, and it's going through to Navas, the goalkeeper. He's one of a number of goalkeepers in this World Cup, Danny, that are unknown, basically, to a British audience at five-five. But this guy is looking for a new club. I gather he quite wants to play in England, and he is really good. I think there'll be lots of players from the so-called lesser nations, if you like, that we don't know too much about around the world. Those players put themselves in the shop window. It's always a little bit of a risk if you buy somebody off the back of a tournament, when it's only, you know, possibly two or three good games. But it's certainly an opportunity for them to be watched again. Ajaxia, a chore, rather. He plays for Ajaxia in France. He's another one of the Mexican goalkeeper who is looking for a move, and he's outstanding. Throw into Costa Rica, launch towards the half-way line, headed back by Loane, in by Lampard. Barclay heads into Wilshire, into Barclay again. His pass was aimed at Lampard. It was slightly overhead, but it's collected by Keahill. Keahill to Shaw. England settling down. Nine minutes gone, here in Bell Horizonte. Nil Nil, Costa Rica and England. Wilshire Tackle loses the ball. Costa Rica cleared upfield in the direction of Campbell, but it's ahead of the striker, and it's through to Ben Foster. He quickly finds, small, an on-bar Lampard to the near side of the England left, and Shaw. Shaw curls it inside, but that's behind Sturridge, headed away quite comfortably by Miller, but now it's back with Sturridge again, to the right of the penalty area. Not many white shirts in support. Sturridge has the ball, though, and moving inside towards the edge of the penalty area. Plays it to Wilshire, back to Lampard. Lampard couldn't get the ball under his feet. Loses possession, and Costa Rica counterattack, though they slow things down there. Just over the half-way line. The ball hit towards the near side of the field, towards Campbell. Campbell, no, in towards the penalty area. Was he fouled there? Play continues, and then the offside flag is raised, and a little unlucky there, Costa Rica not to get a free kick. Yeah, it was a really good move. Again, this time it was Luke Shaw. A little bit exposed down England's left-hand side, in a two-on-one situation. Joel Campbell decided to go inside. It was a great little one-two on the edge of the box, and England a little bit fortunate. I think it's a big game for Gary Cahill. He's really got to marshal that defence. That experience will do him well. He is now the senior member of that defence. It's 0-0 here in Valorazzonte. I'm assuming it's still 0-0 between Italy and Uruguay in the other game, and it is 0-0. The reason that's frankly of great importance, of course, is that if Italy get a draw or a win, then they will go through. Uruguay have to win the match. Conor McNamara is there. Yeah, still 0-0 between Italy and Uruguay, and the Italians knowing that this scoreline would see them through. Pat Nevin, they're parking about two buses on the edge of the penalty area. Yeah, it's a one that we haven't used to a great deal in this world cup so far, certainly, but the play, and it's a one to cynical. There's a lot of cynical throws out there, a very cynical looking game, particularly for the Italians, but let's be honest, the better than Uruguay as well. Yeah, Suarez has been kicked by Barzagli. Chiellini has been elbowed in the chest. It's a real fight here in Natal. It's Italy 0-0, Uruguay 0. It will be. Amazingly, some of the coverage here in Brazil is rather narrow minded. Of course, we've got a presence in Natal, but I would have assumed that one of the many pictures we have on our television sets would have shown us live coverage of Uruguay. In fact, Marc Pugac has got it. We haven't got it up here, Marc. Use an error, I think, Alan. This might be... Was it really? What a shape. Here's Wiltshire coming forward for England. The story, again, to the D. Oh, just wide. Left foot shot. Curled just wide of the far post. Again, individual brilliance from Daniel Sturridge. He's just had a glance up at the big screen, looking to the replay. See how far it was away. Stopped the ball. Instinctive shot with his left foot curling towards the far post, just drifted wide in the end. But so far, I'm not quite sure what style of play England are. You know, it's not really playing on the counter attack. It's not high tempo getting forward. It's not pass, pass, pass, pass. I want to see a bit more definition to their style. Quickly to the cricket. Pat Murphy at heading, Lee. We're waiting for a decision about Chris Jordan. He may well be out. He survived a TV review half an hour ago, but the original decision from the umpire, Steve Davis, is that he is out. The score is 212 for seven, and the overs are ticking by here now, and Jordan is out. He's been given out. It's now 212 for eight. There are 28 overs left, and Sri Lanka only need two more wickets. Thanks, Pat, whose voice like England are just about hanging on there. 13 minutes gone here in Belarosa on day Costa Rica, Neil England, Nell just to confirm it still Italy, Neil Uruguay, Neil in the towel. Balls on the halfway line with Campbell for Costa Rica. The England fans, I gather, are singing always look on the bright side of life. Well, I think they've probably got over their disappointment now of those two games. I have to remember, you know, they are in Brazil. Fantastic place to be. You know, great food, great drink, great views all around the country. So I think, you know, they're just here now. They're going to enjoy what a little time left they have in Brazil. Danny Mills speaking from personal experience there. England not looking that good so far. You'd have seen it on your tally if you could get it working, Alan. It wasn't there earlier. That's enough said about that. Cahill de Smollin. I'm smalling to the left side and Sean, the halfway line Sean was caught there but his missed control didn't help him and then that's a weak pass forward by Wilshire and Costa Rica have possession again on the far side of the field with Diaz. He plays for Mines in the Bundesliga. A Mexican wave has broken out around the stadium and we haven't had a quarter of an hour of the game yet. And that's a crossfield ball hit by Costa Rica straight out of play. It's a throw in to England. Shaw's going to take it. Not a sniff of a goalbound effort yet. Apart from that shot from Sturridge that wasn't that far wide. Shaw to take the throw in. Twenty yards inside the Costa Rican half. He ignores Wilshire. Throws the Sturridge instead. Sturridge back to Shaw. Wilshire's available down the left side. Shaw moves in field. Naively loses possession and it's with Bran Ruiz. Bran Ruiz glides into the far side. Campbell controls it. Campbell now looking for Diaz. Now he finds Diaz on the far touch line. That's the Costa Rican left in field it goes. Then Diaz wants more. Back to Roy Miller and Miller finds Gonzalez one of the three central defenders. He's another of them now. Duarte who plays for Club Bruges. Back to Gonzalez who plays in the MLS for Columbus crew. Switches play toward the far side of the field. Well anticipated by Jones. He heads it out and it's going to be a throw in to Costa Rica just beyond the halfway line. Nil Nil here. Still Nil Nil in the towel between Italy and Uruguay. And let's go to Ian Dennis on the touch line. It might be a dead rubber but England's support here sitting pitch side for five live is fantastic. They have had a rendition of always look on the bright side of life. Instead of footballs coming home England's going home but they're not very popular with the rest of the fans inside this stadium because they're refusing to take part in the Mexican way. As I would. They're absolutely right. Ruiz for Costa Rica. Exchanges passes with Takeda and now Campbell loses it for Costa Rica. It's not a great game of football this. Now there was that pass out of the England defence by Smalling straight out of play on the far side of the field. Costa Rican throw in. Costa Rica. Arguerite just slightly the better side at the moment. Here's Duarte and it's quickly flicked on by Borges and it's run over the halfway line now down the near side of the field with Campbell for Costa Rica. Campbell still not considered good enough to be playing for Arsenal. He is on the Arsenal books back to Brown Ruiz who scored that winning goal against Italy. His pass forward not great. Lampard clears it. Lallana still inside his own half. The Sturridge in the centre circle. Sturridge was surely followed that he was at the second attempt by Roy Miller and it's a free kick awarded by the Algerian referee. It's a little bit disjointed at the moment in terms of the England play. Again a little bit understandable. All these players haven't played an awful lot together. My biggest concern I'd be interested and we'll see what Chris Waddle thinks. We've talked about philosophy. How England are playing going forward. We talked about identity. I don't think England have either at the moment. I don't know what the philosophy of the style of players and I don't want our identity. Once upon a time England, strong defensively, difficult to beat will work really, really hard, good from set pieces. Now I look at this team and I don't know what England is. I don't know what we are going to, what style of play we're supposed to be playing. Is that Hodgson's fault? I'm not sure whose fault it is. I don't know whether it's part of Hodgson, part of the players, part of the bigger picture. That's what we need to solve. Here's Sturridge, left foot folly just tipping over the crossbar. Didn't get down quickly enough, but at least twice now Sturridge has been looking at goal. Well the two half chances that Sturridge have had have been moments that he's created himself. He's got the ball, he's done a little step over, a little skill and he's had a shot. It's not like we are creating chances by good build up play or we get the ball wide. We get the ball into the box as you know when Shearer once played. Waddle was on the wing. That's what it was all about. I'm just looking at England at the moment and it's just an OK game of football. There's no real purpose about anything. Campbell back to the halfway line and then it swung towards the far side of the field by Decada headed on initially by Dears, but cleared by England high over the halfway line. Only Sturridge is up there. I mean look, there's not an England player within 40 yards of Daniel Sturridge. I thought we were down to play 4-3-3 today. That was certainly the suggestion made by Roy Hodgson. Haven't seen much evidence of it yet. But England have been throwing on the far side of the field, level with the edge of the Costa Rican penalty area. Sturridge needs rather more support than he's getting. It's one thing tightening up the midfield. Well it's a 4-4-1-1 and Barclays almost drifted into that midfield area at times and making it a 4-5-1 if you like. I mean he needs to get a little bit closer to Daniel Sturridge and give him some support. Lots of white shirts inside the Costa Rican half at the moment. Here's Sean, 19 minutes gone. Nil-nil here in Belo Horizonte to Frank Lampard, edge of the D. Lampard to Sturridge. Sturridge tries to back heal the ball to Lampard again. Only he met by a defender though and cleared up towards Campbell. It's out of play off Campbell and it will be a throw in to England. You're listening to 5 Live Your World Cup Station on the BBC. Brazil 2014. England finished today. We don't finish. It's with Gary Kaer, just two players retained by Roy Hudson in the starting 11 from the side that lost to Uruguay. Back it goes to Ben Foster. I wonder when Foster come on as a substitute sometime in the second half, not at half time. Selfie goalkeeper. Now Milner on the far side, turns away well from the marker, feeds it through towards Sturridge. Final touch back by the defender. Not seen as an intended back pass so the goalkeeper can grab the ball with both hands. 20 minutes gone. Costa Rica nil, England nil. It's still nil nil in Natal. England haven't really built up a purposeful attack yet, have they? It really is just Costa Rica give the ball away or Sturridge gets it, turns and shoots. There's been no buildup of play, no sort of momentum gathering from England. It's really been, I think Costa Rica, dictating the style and the tempo of play at the moment. And Connor McNamara will just confirm that it's nil nil in Natal. Yes, Alan still scoreless here between Italy and Uruguay. An exciting game though, so much at stake for both sides. Perlos had a shot from distance. It caused more trouble for the Uruguay goalkeeper than it should have done. He fumbled it over for a corner. It's Italy nil Uruguay nil. Now Costa Rica have a free kick. It was a pushover by Frank Lampard, the captain today in the absence of Stephen Gerard. Gerard of course available on the bench at the moment. He's stuck on 113 caps for England. That's two behind the outfield recall held by David Beckham. Costa Rica, chipped the ball over the half way line, running towards Brenes but not controlled by him. Half cleared by England then that looked like a push and it was a push and it's going to be a free kick to England. Now he's back in and played to Milner. Milner goes back to Jones and then into Cahill, onto Smalling. Wiltshire available. Wiltshire not really forward enough for my liking. Now he's here from LaLana's pass. Wiltshire into the Costa Rican half. Shaw into LaLana couldn't control it and Costa Rica have it. Brenes in the centre circle. Red shirts congregated around that centre circle but there's another one towards this near side. That's Gamboa, right wing back, onto Gamboa, back to Gamboa and into Decada. Ruiz, the captain, good touch by Gamboa. Plays a one-two, Gamboa goes forward, falls over because he was stripped and it's a free kick to Costa Rica. And that's the difference I think between the two sides. Costa Rica playing with confidence. Quite happy to be patient. Keep the ball in the middle of the park, keep it moving, one, two, touch and just wait for opportunities. When they see a gap they burst into it and because of that they've now got a free kick, probably 25, 30 yards from goal. Well, it would have been a fantastic stride from that distance I think to test the goalkeeper. By the way, Balotelli, of Italy, has just been booked in the match in the towel and he will miss the game in the last 16, should Italy qualify. I wish that chance still lingered for England. Meantime, it's a free kick to Costa Rica. It's a goal-threatening distance. It's a round about 25 yards, maybe a fraction more. Here comes the shot right footed up and goodness, and either hit the top of the crossbar or the save by Foster. It's gone behind either way. It's going to be a corner to Costa Rica and we're past the mid-repoint in the first half. Here's Mike Ingram and Neil Neal. I think, sorry Mike, I think Ben Foster might have just got a touch on this, just trying to see the replay again as it comes in. He did just touch it onto the bar. I think it probably would have hit the bar anyhow and now there's a corner but a great save. Well, the referee initially appeared to give a goal kick and then had a little think. It's a corner kick to Costa Rica. It's Neal Neal here against England. The corner kick over on the far side and Lampard scuffs it away and Barclay comes on a break and is immediately caught in possession. Campbell now moving forward for Costa Rica. There's danger on the edge of the England penalty area. Ruiz finding Campbell. Some of the defenders have stayed forward following that corner and they've got another one. That was a prime example of Barclay being young and naive and making the wrong decision. England were looking to counterattack and he tried to beat a player. He just knocked it into him. Didn't do a trick, didn't move the ball sideways. It should have passed it and then moved and gone around the player that way. Another corner to Costa Rica over on the far side and Foster comes for it and hulls onto it very well but there's nobody to give it to. That's exactly what Roy Hutchins was talking about earlier in the tournament about Ross Barclay. It's an awkward game for Costa Rica in a sense and that they don't obviously want to get any yellow cards so they can't be over vigorous. Mark Pugatch has already mentioned that they get the draw, they'll win the group. So they're playing sometimes within themselves as well. But the biggest skill in football, Mike, is making the right decision. You ask any of those players down there under no pressure, yes, they can all pass it five yards, 50 yards, 60 yards, they can all shoot at goal. They can do all of those things but the skill is making the right decision at the right time and when you're young, sometimes you make the wrong ones. Lampard has hoisted a very good ball over the top and there's a mistake here inside the penalty area which almost led in Jack Wilshire. Costa Rica in the shadow of the stand looking to clear down the sneer side and that ball has eventually gone out of play. We're in sunny Bella Horizonte and it's nil nil between Costa Rica and England. It's nil nil between Italy and Uruguay and the score lines stay like this. Then Costa Rica win the group and Italy would finish second but still an awful long way to go on five-live. England all in white today led by Frank Lampard equaling Sir Bobby Charlton's 106 caps. He loved to score today to get his 30th goal for England and the free kick is almost a mess there by England. Now it's played down the right hand side towards Phil Jones. Jones gets support from Daniel Sturridge. The Larners made a run into the penalty area. Sturridge has given the ball away and Brennes now for Costa Rica up to Campbell back again to Brennes and that's a bit short towards Ruiz but it's a great flick to find Campbell. Smoaning just backs off and then smalning will tidy up for England and he'll remember of course Campbell playing for Olympia Arcos in the Champions League against Manchester United this season. Ball into the Costa Rica half and Llanana now has gone into the centre. Wasn't getting much of the ball at all down this left hand side and England building although now it's Lampard looking forward in hope really towards Sturridge out comes the goalkeeper now. I was very interested in what you were saying Danny about the identity because it just seems to me now that England seem to be caught between two or three stills. They've almost forgotten what they're good at and they're trying to be other teams. Well they just got out there and they just sort of passed the ball around. No real direction. No real purpose. They think England are going to score at the moment. It's going to be a moment of individual brilliance from Daniel Sturridge or it's going to be a catastrophic mistake from Costa Rican. That's it. Costa Rican have given the ball away and Daniel Sturridge has the ball with Barclay to the right hand side. Wolches made a run in the area. Barclay is getting a little bit tangled up here on the edge of the area but he's riding the challenges. Good play from Barclay. Now he slots it up for James Milner. This ball should come into the penalty area for England. Milner scoops the ball in headed down to Sturridge. Sturridge has a chance and look he thinks he was brought down some seven yards out. He's looking at the referee but there's nothing for England there and England should have scored. They shouldn't have been looking for the penalty without looking at the replay. I'm going to say that's good defending. The cross was a little bit slow to come in and then there's two Costa Ricans challenge each other. It dropped to Sturridge and as he came in, it's Duarte just got his body in. Just did enough to put off Sturridge. Got his body in between Sturridge and the ball. That's good defending. You know, brave in that situation. If he's given away a penalty, you know, Daniel Sturridge has got to be a little bit sharper, a little bit quicker, get his shot away. Danny Mills with us and five live nil-nil between Costa Rica and England. Here comes the captain of Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz. He's been tackled by Lampard and now Barclay picks up possession and knocks it really long to the side and Sturridge will have to give up on that one. The intent was right but the delivery wasn't and Costa Rica. By the way, had an appalling build up coming into this world. They really didn't do well at all in their friendly matches but they've found themselves in a group with three former world champions. They've beaten two of them already. Italy and Uruguay. Now they're trying to make it a hat trick here today. Throw in to Costa Rica who plays three at the back and they have the wing backs. One of two teams doing that. It's well cut. Chile also playing with three central defenders and Chile are through to play Brazil in the last 16. Borla is back in the England half and Cahill now finds Lampard. Nil-nil. Back again to Cahill. England haven't created very much. They've swapped over now. They have it. Yes, they have swapped over Milner and Lallana just for the moment. Milner's playing down this near side, the left. Lallana over on the right. It's still quite a disjointed game though, Danny, isn't it? There's not much flow about it. No, it's all. Costa Rica really dictating it. They're happy for a slow paced game just to keep the ball. But England just haven't troubled their defensive tool. I'm surprised at that. These young players, this is a great opportunity for some of those young players to go out and really put down a marker and say, look, one I should have been in the start in 11, in the first two games. Or moving forward, I'm part of the Zinglin team. I want to play in this side. I want to go to the Euros. I want to go to the next World Cup. Yeah, because those Euro qualifying games will come around very, very quickly. Longboard out of the Costa Rican defence by Diaz over on the far side. It's Brenes against Jones and the Manchester United player heads the ball out for a Costa Rica throwing nil nil here in the horizontal Costa Rica throw the ball back. It's Diaz, the left wing back into midfield Costa Rica now playing the ball into feet lovely little flick from Ruiz. But this time England managed to get hold of it. Milner sets off down this near side. Someone needs to help him, though. He's running with the ball and there's nobody offering themselves ready. Jack Wall should goes past the first challenge, wins the free kick. He wasn't really going anywhere there. Jack Walsh is so he's done well to win the free kick. That's a really good point. You've just picked up and Mike when England players get the ball, they've got one option is only one player that really wants it. They only got one player to pass to you need three or four options. You know if you're going to play well and keep the ball moving very, very quickly, free kick has touched off short and it's down this left hand side with Luke Shaw. Shaw a very strong challenge coming in from Gamboa. The right back England still pressing lampards doing well here has to be careful to do it legally and now Shaw gives the ball away and the goalkeeper came out with a defender ignored him and now hammers the ball towards Ruiz who can't control it on the halfway line. But now he has a second opportunity. Barkley tangles with Ruiz. But so fantastic skill on the ball from Brian Ruiz turning brilliantly away from England players. Ball played into the centre and now it's offside against Brennness. The pass was just delayed as England just nudged forward out of defence and it's a free kick to England. Bill Nill. Brilliant bit of skill from Brian Ruiz to get away from Wilshire initially. Well, Maradona spin. It was called in in my day but superb. But England at the moment need to start playing with a higher tempo. But that is the biggest problem. Every time that Kav Gauz got the ball now, he's got one option and he's had to go back to the goalkeeper. England have got to work harder when they've got possession. He's got to be tactically more aware. Get themselves in a position to receive the ball. Brian Ruiz, of course, sent out on loan by Fulham to PSV in the way that Campbell was by Arsenal to Olympiakos. We're just going to watch Milner give chase towards the corner flag and now we'll hear more news of that Uruguay-Italy game from Conor McNamara. Still Italy-Nill, Uruguay-Nill. A draw good enough for Italy, remember. Uruguay need a win to be sure. It's tense and it's physical here and Ballatelli's booking means he'll be suspended for the second round. Should Italy get there? Uruguay looking dangerous on the break with Suarez, but Pat Nevin alongside Italy are organised to the back with their three central defenders. They are. They're going to be really hard to break down, but the best thing that's happened for me in the last 10-15 minutes, feel like a quarterback has dropped into the pocket and is zipping the ball about all over the place. He is controlling this game. A draw. Nill-Nill will be good enough for Italy. Uruguay have to win to be sure. Italy-Nill, Uruguay-Nill. Thank you. Nill-Nill is also good enough here for Costa Rica to win the group and that's the scoreline here as Lampard hits a long ball forward and that's lovely running from Adam Lallana towards the corner flag over on the far side. In comes the cross. It takes a deflection and England have a rare corner. Corner kick to England with 32 minutes gone in the first half here in Bellar Horizonte. And now let's see. A lot of England set pieces in the previous two games were very disappointing. Can they do something here down? That's really been down to delivery, which surprised even Gerrard's delivery wasn't as good as it normally was. You know, set pieces are all about the ball in. It doesn't matter how tall your players are, how good they are in the air. If the delivery is not right, it's a complete waste. Well, Barkley thought the corner was down this left hand side but he's been made to go across to the right into the sunshine over on the far side and England's central defenders are all in the penalty area, away to our left. Cahill, Smalling and Jones. That was a very false alarm from Barkley. He seemed to shape up to take the corner then ran over the ball. Yes, the lines were just stepped in front of him. It was Cahill and Duarte at the far post. She's having a little bit of a coming together. Corner kick to England. Nill Mill against Costa Rica in this final game for them in the World Cup. Barkley raises both arms and then the ball balloons off the defender who I'm not sure he was 10 yards, but it's gone behind for another corner kick and we get a replacement ball immediately. But this is what I'm talking about, Mike. You know, Barkley's got the corner. You know, this is something that you practice. You're delivering from set pieces and he's hit a player 10 yards in front of him. Well, Sturridge is being manhandled at the moment inside the six yard area as the corner kick is delivered. It was almost an opportunity for Gary Cahill who came diving in and sent him out of panic at the back there from Costa Rica. They've forced the ball behind for another corner and now Barkley has come to the right side of the stadium to take this corner and England still have an opportunity here with Cahill causing a few problems in the penalty area, smalling in Jones as well. So Ross Barkley starting a World Cup game here in Belo Horizonte with this England corner. Nill Mill against Costa Rica. Sturridge is still being lent on by one of the Costa Rican defenders as the corner kick is lifted very high to the far post headed down and then headed over by Daniel Sturridge in the end. Well, they had three corners there, England. They couldn't force it home and Sturridge couldn't control his header and put it down. It's gone behind. Let's go to David Law at Wimbledon. Rafael Nadal is a relieved man because although he lost the first set 6-4 against Martin Cleeson, he's come back to win the next three by the scoreline of 6-3 and now faces another clash against Lucas Rossell, the man who knocked him out in the second round two years ago. Thank you very much. We're four hours behind you here in Belo Horizonte. We're coming towards the final stages of the first half. 10 minutes to go. England Nill, Costa Rica Nill. It's still Uruguay Nill, Italy Nill. So with these scorelines at the moment, Costa Rica would win the group with Italy finishing second. Ball is with Costa Rica inside the England half. Ruiz is there, just finding space. Campbell back again to Ruiz. They seem to have a good understanding those two. Back into midfield and now the highly rated Takeda. The young man, just 22 years of age, who's making an impression here at the World Cup. Costa Rica give the ball away, very tight for England in midfield, short from Wilshire, but Lampard now has managed to scoop it down this left-hand side. Milner, who's a really good athlete, is there on the ball. Lola and Sturridge in the penalty area. Can Milner cross this towards Sturridge or Lola? Great goalkeeping. Fantastic from Navas. And he really, as Alan was saying earlier, is earning himself quite a reputation in Spain. It's a really good take. James Milner did very, very well, not only to catch the ball down this side, but then to dig out a decent cross on his left foot, which is a weaker side. No real purpose from England. That's what I've been most disappointed about. This is a young side. Go on playing with some pride. Put in some effort. This is the last game of a World Cup. Okay, we're out of the tournament, but deal with it. Move on. We talk about a fresh start. We talk about moving on from here. I've not seen anything to really impress me from a singling from players here. That's given away by Costa Rica in midfield. Lampard has won the ball, and now Lampard finds Barkley. Wilshire's made a run. He can find him, but it's just ahead of him, and now comes the keeper once more. The final pass there from Barkley, not the one that Wilshire wanted. By the way, Prince Harry's here today, and I've noticed quite a few young ladies in the stadium are offering to marry him, holding up the flags, saying, marry me, Harry. So he's watching on, and will obviously be disappointed like all the other England supporters that England are at this stage. It was two years ago today, by the way, they lost to Italy on penalties in the quarterfinal of the Euros, and 10 years ago today, they lost to Portugal on penalties in the quarterfinal of 2004. They haven't got to the quarterfinal or a penalty shootout this time around. So let's go and rejoin Ian Dennis in the sunshine down their pitchside. Wilting in the heat here, Mike. The only observation I'd say pitchside is that with the exception of Milner, who's now switched to the left in the Llaner when he just peeled away a few minutes before, in the central midfield areas for England, there is a real lack of movement that I've noticed in comparison to the Costa Rica side, and I've also got to add the England support behind me is unwavering. Thank you. I mean, the thing is, Danny, many of your fans would have, would have, would be here for the first time. They probably haven't been to the first two games. This is their package, and they've come out here, and they're just going to make the most of it, aren't they? Going again, just to reiterate what Ian says and what he's looking at. You know, Ross Barkley is on the ball now. Where's his options? Where are the players moving? You should have two, at least two, three options every time you get the ball, because if not, it's predictable, and it's easy to play against. And that's exactly what's happening to England at the moment. The Llaner is really still struggling to make an impact here. He's operating on the right-hand side at the moment, not really influencing the game. It just goes to show them, like, what a step up international football is to Premier League. You know, from Premier League to international, it's probably three steps on the ladder. You know, so halfway between that is maybe Champions League, but even still, you know, international is way beyond the Premier League. Well, Costa Rica have just dreadfully given the ball away, but can it, are England going to be good enough here to take advantage? Because Costa Rica, for the most part here on the back foot, they're just happy with what they have. They know they haven't got to do anything too reckless. They certainly mustn't get any cards like we've just heard about Ballatelli now, if Italy go through being out of the game in the last 16. So England with Frank Lampard. Lampard, that's a good ball for sure. Hasn't really got forward very much, sure. Now to James Milner. Milner is being tackled, and the ball is with Costa Rica, and Takeda's there. And he's going to use Campbell's pace down this right hand side. Campbell now nudges the ball off to Gamboa, the right back. Costa Rica players in the area, and it's too close to Foster. Foster makes a comfortable save, and we'll now relaunch England, and we have six minutes to go in the first half. And the game really is in third gear, for the most part, and Foster now to clear for England. They will, of course, make three changes at some point in the second half. Allen's already speculated about whether Foster might be given a game, because certainly Rojhaj and what's all the players in the squad at least be able to go back and say, I experienced the World Cup. And what a dreadful clearance that was acknowledged immediately there by Ben Foster out of play, handing the initiative straight back again to the team in the red shirts from Central America. I've been disappointed with England. I have to say, I thought this is an opportunity for these younger players to come out and really make an impact. You know, your last game, a lot of these haven't played. They're fresh. You know, go out, show what you can do. But at the moment, it's not even been a lukewarm performance. It's like Luster. It really is. Take the game to Costa Rica. Go and beat them. You know, okay, they've beaten Uruguay. They've beaten Italy. They're not world beaters by any means. This is a game that this, even this young England team, if they put their minds to it, if they went out, could go and win. But, Danny, I do remember Italian 90, for example, when England lost the semi-final, I had to play the third, fourth place game. I'm not sure too many players wanted to play in that particular game, and it was the same in 88 as well. Third and fourth place, I think, is different, though. This is a young, a lot of these players haven't played in the World Cup. It's not their responsibility, what happened in the last games. Go out and prove yourself on the biggest stage. Go win 3-0. That was a chance for Wilshire, if he had looked up to playing Jones over on the far side of the field. But now instead, it's going down this left-hand side, and Milner's going to lose that. The heads were down there, and Jones did offer himself over on the right. He was in space, but the ball was played short. Let us go back as we move towards the end of the first half to Natal Conor McNamara. Yeah, still very tense, very edgy here. Italy, 0. Uruguay, 0. A draw, good enough for Italy. Uruguay need a win to be sure. The referee's a busy man, Batnev, and Suarez has just tripped Pirlo down below us. I mean, there's been so many freekicks in the game. Tough point to referee, but there's a lot of tension, as you see out there. Biggest thing for me, I think the game's been strangled really to death by the Italian defence as much as anything else. They really do look like he wants to play simply as a break. Nothing more. Italy, 0. Uruguay, 0. Same scoreline here. Milner's just picking himself up slowly, having been heavily tackled a few moments ago. Campbell's got a second chance now, having initially, I thought, given the ball away. Moved breaks down from Costa Rica, who are not playing particularly well themselves by their own standards. Milner is still having a problem. Trying to get back on his feet again, as now Ross Barkley has the ball, and Sturridge is looking for it. Sturridge now, back again to Barkley, edge of the area. Good quick feet from Barkley. Is there a shot at the end of it? Barkley shoots wide in the end. No composure in the end from Ross Barkley, as Milner now walks off that injury, and Costa Rica have a goal kick. You're right. No composure from Barkley. He was desperately getting shot away. He had no options. He was, you know, once he got the ball back off Sturridge, had nobody else to pass to, had to try and beat two or three defenders. England have got to start working harder when they've got the ball. Got to help each other out. It's a team game for goodness sake. Not sure who's coming on, of course, in the second half. It would be nice to think that we might see Raheem Sterling again. Only three changes can be made. And of course, I suppose Ricky Lambert, if Roy Hodges is looking at trying to play players who not had much action, he could turn to him as well. So Costa Rica nil, England nil, Italy nil, Uruguay nil. Here in Bellahorizonte, Costa Rica have a chance. They do have a chance because the referee has given them a free kick for the foul on Campbell. But I just get the feeling that they're playing a little bit within themselves here, Costa Rica. Oh, definitely. But rightly so, they're top of the group, Mike. They've got six points. You know, they only need a point and probably don't even need that with the way that the other game is going at the moment. They don't want to pick up injuries. They don't want to tie themselves out too much. You know, they don't have probably too many options, strength and depth from the bench. So they said, look, just get through this game. Don't anything silly. Keep the ball and get a draw. We win the group. Well, they scored it around about this time of the first half against Italy. They have this free kick and it's immediately flagged against them for offside, up on the far side. They scored right at the end of the first half through Brian Ruiz. And we were watching that game at the airport. And that goal was scored about 30 seconds or so after they were denied just about the clearest penalty they've ever seen against Italy. And that really was justice when Ruiz scored. We're moving towards added time here at the end of the first half. Well, England were fortunate there might have was given offside because there were two players at the back post. One of them was completely unmarked. Again, that's just lack of concentration. Individuals not doing their job. And that was really poor from storage. It was a nothing sort of ball into the penalty area. Not that there were too many England players offering themselves throw into England. The Larnas there and the Larnas balling will be cleared by Costa Rica to the far side for an England throw in. There won't be a great deal of time added on at the end of the first half as England have a throw in. Nilnil against Costa Rica. Jones is battling down that far side. Larnas gone down. England have a free kick right at the end of this first half. Now this normally would be taken by Gerard or maybe even Baines if they were on the field. They're not. Lampard's going across there. And at the end of an unconvincing first half for England, they do have a set piece and they have a chance to trouble the Costa Rican defenders. So Frank Lampard captained today. A little bit of wrestling going on down there in the area between Phil Jones. And in comes the free kick straight into the goalkeepers midriff. And that really in some respects shows up the Assyngland team. We're going to go now to Headingley. Pat Murphy. Stuart Broad's out LBW for naught. Last of the long time there, 24 balls. Thought about putting them TV review, decided not to. So the last pair are together. There are 20 overs left today. Sri Lanka needs one more wicket, 228 for nine, but it's getting darker. Thank you, Pat. That's the crumb of comfort maybe for England that the weather might intervene. But Danny Mills, it's half time here. They just talked to us while Pat was there. How on earth did Brenes suddenly fight? It was almost a Luis Suarez situation again. The ball was hit long and Brenes was in on goal on England. Shocking. Absolutely shocking. That is, again, how many times do you want to get punished from lack of concentration? A hoof downfield. That's all it was from the goalkeeper. Wasn't trying to pick a player. It's just a hopeful punt down the pitch. No one concentrating. Brenes was allowed to get in. Fortunately, touch wasn't brilliant in the end. And when he cut back, England got back and it was deflection. But that could have easily been one nil down. You cannot afford to switch off at any point during a World Cup game. Well, the England players have been saying in the build up to this game, Mark, that they are deeply concerned about all the fans who've come out here and haven't really seen them play. They felt they owed the fans today. Well, they're still owing them, I'm afraid. There hasn't been a great half. It's nil now. Just noticed that Paolo Wanchop, who's on the Costa Rican staff, having a chat with Frank Lampard as they left the pitch at half time. What do you think the Roy Hodgson looks at his bench? Maybe a change or two in the second half need to get some energy, some dynamism into this team, Danny? Change of attitude is what it needs more than anything else, not necessarily personnel. It's an abject performance. It's an opportunity for young players to show what they can do. Be a bit more dynamic. Give someone the option. Work hard. You've got 45 minutes left now. And then you can go on all day for three weeks. Give it everything you have possibly got. I'm looking at the moment, and that is a 75% performance. Simply, I don't think England are working hard enough. Well, who says that men can't multitask? Because I'm watching the England game and Connor, I'm watching your game on the television and everybody, every time I look up, someone's lying on the ground, riding around. Remarkably, there's only two minutes being added on for stoppages at the end of a very stop-start first half. Italy nil, Uruguay nil. It's an entertaining watch. It's an exciting watch, and you just feel if Cavani or Suarez can get some space, the whistle does now blow for halftime, that they could take a chance. But space is something the Italians do not give away in defense, Pat Nevin. It's a masterful display of the dark arts of football right now from the Italian defense, and that's not men's and astounding. That's just the way it is. They're very, very good at it. Every time they get down, they roll about, they're not really hurt. Killing the game, killing the pace of it. Everybody in here is a neutral once Uruguay scored a goal, so the game will open up a little bit. But in the end, it has to be Uruguay that must start taking more chances. The Italians have only had half chances themselves in Mobilea with a shot that was charged down. Ballatelli tried one out from well outside the penalty area. He's been booked. If Italy go through, Mario Ballatelli will miss the second round game. It's been the only yellow card in a first half full of strong tackles and fouls. With the Uruguayans now needing to score, as things stand, Costa Rica and Italy will be the two nations going through from this group. But a lot could change in the second half. Nil Nil. Thank you very much for the Jensen. Natal back to Pat Murphy at Headingley. The clouds are banking up. It's getting darker. Gia Wardner has had to come on to bowl his exploratory offspin because they can't trust the quicker bowlers because they'll be off the bad light. There are 20 overs ago. Anderson has done this before at Cardiff in 2009 with Panasar. The other end, can Moenale get his 100? Is made in 100 in his second test. 88 not out. 228 for nine. Sri Lanka need one more wicket. England need to endure for another 90 and a half overs. And of course, ball by ball on Five Live Sports Extra, and we will be going regularly over to Pat, who can keep us in touch with events there. When we're down here in Belo Horizonte, there's a 6-0-6 with Mark Chapman, Chris Waddle and Robbie Savage. The lines will open later. The usual number 0500 909 693 85058 on the text at BBC Five Live on social media and do use the hashtag BBC World Cup. Then at 9 o'clock, three teams can still progress from Group C. We'll bring you commentary on Greece, Ivory Coast and updates on Japan against Columbia. And that game, Japan, Columbia is live on BBC Three as well. Right, news time. Here's Lucy Gray. On digital, online, smart phone and tablet. This is BBC Five Live. David Cameron has apologised for hiring Andy Coulson to work as his director of communications at Downing Street. After a jury at the Old Bailey convicted the former News of the World editor of phone hacking. The Prime Minister says he takes full responsibility for the decision. I asked him and my chief of staff asked him whether he knew about phone hacking. We accepted his assurances. That was the basis on which I employed him. I was always clear that I was giving someone a second chance. He had resigned from the news of the world because of what had happened there. I accepted his assurances. I gave him a job. It turns out to be a bad decision and I'm extremely sorry about that. Andy Coulson now faces a maximum of two years in prison for hacking. The former News International chief executive Rebecca Brooks was cleared of all the charges against her, along with four other people. The Labour leader Ed Miliband says the government has been tainted by Mr Coulson's appointment. David Cameron must do much more than an apology. He owes the country an explanation for why he did not act, why he did not act on these allegations against Andy Coulson, why has the evidence piled up? He didn't do anything about it and he's got to explain. And Five Live's chief political correspondent John Pena says David Cameron now faces many questions. He's under heavy attack for hiring Coulson. He can expect to get more stick on that front at question time in the House of Commons tomorrow. The apology, it was absolutely unavoidable. He'll hope that it does something to disarm the criticism against him. I guess the test is going to be, does it dent his ratings? Police say that thousands of people's phones were targeted by the news of the world. The lawyer Charlotte Harris represents many of the victims and she's been describing how they're likely to be reflecting on what happened. People forget how creepy it is not knowing how personal information finds its way into a newspaper. So before the awareness of phone hacking began, I had clients who were falling out with their nearest and their dearest and their trusted employees thinking that there was some kind of leak. If you are a person who has been working for a celebrity who is of interest to the press, why should you be in a position where your phone is not only hacked but you also find yourself under suspicion? Well the news of the world was closed by its parent company News International in July 2011 after it emerged that a private investigator was asked to hack voicemails left on the mobile phone of the murdered Surrey teenager Millie Dowler in 2002. Paul Horrocks is the former editor of the Manchester Evening News. He also sits on the panel which appoints members of the proposed new press regulator Ipsu. We've gone through a pretty dreadful chapter in newspaper history haven't we? The criminal justice system has run, is running its course. We've had one of the longest British criminal trials ever. We've had one of the longest police inquiries ever although that was a very slow start. So I think the public can now have the absolute confidence that there's no stolen and left unturned. And the racehorse trainer Sir Mark Prescott is a friend of Rebecca and Charlie Brooks. He says the trial has taken its toll especially the revelation that Rebecca Brooks had an affair with Andy Coulson. Anybody who's experienced one of this sort of court case plenty of skeletons are rattled around in all our wardrobes. It's bound to have been an uncomfortable experience for both of them but I suppose any disaster in a married couple's life has one of two effects doesn't it? It either drives a wedge between them or binds them closer together. Hopefully it will have been the latter. So just to recap on the hacking charges then Andy Coulson found guilty of a charge of conspiracy to intercept voicemails. Rebecca Brooks was cleared of all charges along with her husband, her PA and the former head of security for News International. The former news of the world managing editor Stuart Cutner was found not guilty of conspiring to hack voicemails and the jury is still considering misconduct in her public office charges against Andy Coulson and the former news of the world royal editor Clive Goodman which relates to allegations of paying officials for royal phone directories. In other news then the US secretary of state John Kerry has told the BBC there must be regional unity to expel ISIS rebels who've taken over much of northern and western Iraq. It's not up to the United States of America or some other country to come prancing in and tell Iraqis who their leaders ought to be or what they need to do. What we're trying to do is honor a process. It's up to Iraqis to decide who can unify Iraq, who will they all come together and join with in an effort to seize this moment. John Kerry has been talking to Kurdish leaders in the northern city of Irbil. The rebels are still advancing and are fighting to take a key oil refinery. The Ukrainian military says one of its helicopters has been shot down by pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country. It says the aircraft was hit by a rocket just after takeoff near the city of Sloviansk. Reports say all nine people on board were killed. And leaders at an Aberdeen mosque have appealed to one of the men in an ISIS recruitment video to come home to his family. They've condemned the video by the Islamist militants in which Raqib Amin encouraged other British nationals to join Ajihad. This is Five Live, the home of Brazil 2014. And in travel news, the M1 was closed north and southbound earlier on. It was because of an accident which happened between Daventree at junction 16 and junction 15a at Toaster on the southbound side. It looks as though just the one lane is closed on the southbound side. Cues are backing up to junction 17 at Dunn Church. On the northbound side, better news, all lanes now open. But the queues are backing up from Toaster at junction 15a to Newport Pagnal Services. In Warwickshire, the M6 was also closed. The southbound side is where there was an accident between the M6 toll at junction 3a and junction 3 at Nanitun. All lanes are now open on both the north and the southbound sides. Cues on the southbound side are backing up to the M42 link as I say all lanes open and queues on the northbound side backing up to 2 at Coventry from Nanitun at junction 3. Finally, the A1M heading north junction 6 at Wellin. There was an accident queues are still backing up to junction 5 but all lanes are open. Ornimentioned Five Live travel.

So as it stands Costa Rica will win the group and Italy will go through with them. Let's nip to Pat Murphy at heading the England 9 down. Like rain falling in leads just a few miles away, Mohan Ali on 94.16.2 overs left England 234 for 9. Back to Pat, shortly live ball by ball on Test Might Special, Five Live Sports Extra as we get a tennis correspondent, Russell Fuller at Wimbledon. Serena Williams is on centre court mark, first game of her match against Anna Tattish-Villy. It's lasted eight minutes, she saved three break points and they're back to juice. Earlier in the day, straightforward wins for the likes of Roger Federer, Stan Vavrenko, Miloš Rownic and Anjaska Radvanska. And in the end David Law for Rafa Nadal, but we were wondering at the end of that first set whether Nadal was going to suffer another early exit from these championships. That's right, it took him nearly three hours to get past Martin Cleese, Anna Slovakia and the Slovakian won the first set six forwards, some incredible hitting from the baseline. Reminded us of the match he had against Lukas Rossell two years ago when he lost in the second round and Steve Darcy's last year when he lost in the first round. But eventually Nadal got over the finish line and I suspect he'll be quite dangerous from here and he faces a revenge mission against Lukas Rossell in the second round here this year. Britain's women's number one, Heather Watson was very impressive on number three court earlier beating Eila Tomlianovic of Croatia in straight set 6-3-6-2. Sam Murray won just the one game against Maria Sharapova and there's another British player in action at the moment, Dan Smethurst up against John Isner on court three. Karthin Jarnas Seagram is watching. Thanks Russell, the ninth seed and famous for that longest match in tennis history. Doesn't look like he'll be out here for long against the British number five Dan Smethurst. He's making his Wimbledon debut and Isner is two sets to love ahead. He took the first set 7-5, Smethurst unable to convert any of his six break points. The second set was 6-3. It's going with serve in the third set but it does look as if Andy Murray will be the only British player left in the men's draw by tomorrow. Smethurst in trouble on court three. Highest profile casualty of the day so far, former French open finalist Sarah Irani beaten by the up-and-coming French player Caroline Garcia and Serilla Williams has finally held serve. He took a precisely 10 minutes mark. Thank you very much, Eddie, for that Russell. Let's turn it back to Pat Murphy at heading Lee. 16 overs left 234 for nine. The target a distant one of 350. The light has improved marginally. That's why Eranga is back on now. So, battle is joined. Gia Wardner off. He really didn't trouble the batsman too much and now Mohenali has an interesting problem here, Mark. He has to play for the team. Of course he does. But he's within one blow of his first test match century in his second test. So, he's got a bit of a conundrum there but he has experienced Anderson at the other end who's an old hand at this. You remember Cardiff 2009 with Monty Panazar blocking out against the Aussies. Pat, I've seen the still of the prior dismissal. Is there going to be a bit of a bani about that? I mean, look, to the naked eye, it looks like it is a no-ball but Paul Reifel, the fourth umpire, said there was something behind the line and therefore the ball was valid. First of all, it was a poor shot by prior fending off the short leg. So, let's not forget that. But yes, I tell you why because you need consistency, don't you? And Jordan was given a not out in a very, very similar situation about a no-ball half an hour later. So, I think that's what will exercise England players as well. And I have to say, it looked to me with pride that they stopped the frame too early. Just one more frame and we could have been absolutely certain about the foot which was over the line. It did look a no-ball. It did look as if prior was unlucky. But I'm not sure in the context of a five-day test match whether that should be deemed decisive. I think Angela Matthews, 160, was more decisive and not bowling. It not bowling Sri Lanka out for 150 when they should have done on day one. Thank you, Pat. Ball by ball test match special. Quick where with Chris Waddle, the four-hand back to Alan Green in Rio. Chris, your thoughts on the first half? I'll be quick because obviously coming out could play higher when the ball goes up, get a bit tighter, squeeze it, play a little bit. They've got four in midfield and one up front. So, we're getting out done slightly there. Play a little bit higher. I still think we're so naive. I would say so. It's a fair point. Too much space in midfield. We mark space. We don't mark players. And we're looking for leaders, players who want to step on at this level and take it, get a shirt. And our best way to score at the minute, apart from storage at the odd occasion, is set pieces still. So, we're males off certain things. But I agree. There's no energy. It doesn't look like we want to close the ball down. And we're letting them play and we're making them look better than what they are. Thank you, Chris, with Mark Chapman and Robbie Savage, 6-0-6. The lines are open. No 500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. Nil-nil, Italy, Uruguay as well. Alan Green. During half time, a banner was being displayed by an England fan. And without going into total detail, it listed the cost of flights, costs here in Brazil, and, quote, enjoying ambience. And it came to £5,200. And it ended feeling ungoing home priceless. Well, this has been the worst England display of the three so far. And it just showed what we found out in Miami that the rest are nowhere near good enough. The attitude has been poor, apart from a couple of shots by storage and a header over by storage that has become to a goal was a Costa Rican goal. A free kit from Borges, Borges rather, that was tipped onto the top of the crossbar by Ben Foster. What can I say? A banner is being, crosses to George, has been rolled across between England fans away to my right. We're still waiting for the referee from Algeria to blow the whistle for the start of the second half. No changes in either lineup. First of all, England goalkeeper Foster defends Jones-Cahill, Smolling and Shaw, then Lampard, then four strong across midfielder, front-to-front Lampard, Milner, Wilshire Barkley, and Lallana, and finally, Sturridge, who far too often has been isolated. The goalkeeper for Costa Rica is Navas. Five across there defends, Defends, Gambo, Duarte, Gonzalez, Milner and Diaz, then Borges, Ruiz and Piqueda, and finally Brenes and Cambo. And we're still waiting for television to say it's okay. Now they've got to wait Alan for the two games. The two games have to start simultaneously. That's why. That's the Italian one was slightly delayed. By the way, Perolo has come on for Italy replacing Balotelli as a second half substitute. So the match of significance, frankly, is in the towel. Which of Uruguayan Italy will join Costa Rica in the last 16? Costa Rica, I've just strolled through this. They haven't been put under any pressure whatsoever. That's a careless ball hit up by their central defender Gonzalez, straight out of the play on the near side of the field. England all in white, attacking the end to our right. Costa Rica in their red shirts, blue shorts and red socks. There's a complete lack of urgency in the England team. Jones with the throw in to Barclay. On to Jones. Lallana's around the edge of the day, but it's back instead to Wilshire, who has given the ball away again. Wilshire was the big hope of English football. What's happened to Jack Wilshire? I know he's had a succession of injuries, Danny, but he doesn't look anything like the player who's suddenly sparkle per Arsenal. Anyway, England having defended the moment with Cahill and Cahill puts it out of play, throw in to Costa Rica. It's going to be taken by Diaz. They're left wing back. Not that he's had any defensive pressure put on him. The throw-ins level with the edge of the England penalty area. Ben Foster's goal now covered in shadow. Throw in wasted by Costa Rica, but Lampard in clearing the ball not only got a knock, but he's given it away to Costa Rica. Costa Rica may well think of putting the ball out of play, and they do pull it out of play through Decatur so that Lampard, who's back on his feet now, can receive attention. Should he need it? I don't think anybody will need to come on to see the Frank Lampard. So in England throwing, it should be given back to Costa Rica. And we thought that Belgium-Russia was bad. And there's something to play for there as well. But things are right down at half time. Lack of identity, lack of movement, lack of tactical knowledge. That means where to be to receive the ball, what positions to be to make yourself available. Lack of energy, you know, both with the ball and without the ball. It's just, it is a very lackluster performance. I know that they're out of the tournament. Yes, it's bitterly disappointing, but as I said, there's only one player that's really been involved in all that. Here's Shaw. Sorry, two players, we tell you her in storage. Yeah, Shaw rushing down the left side. He's been foul tackled and it's going to be a free kick to England. And it's ten yards to the left of the penalty, directly in line with the outside of the penalty area. And Frank Lampard's going across to take it. So I was played in with the penalty, but I think that's too quick for the referee, like he's going to call the ball back and Lampard's going to have to play it again. And that option, presumably, is not available now. The run from Lallana. So it's from the left. Three minutes played in the second half here in Belo Horizonte. Lampard right footed, swirls it in, easily headed clear by Costa Rica, towards the halfway line, picked up by Milit, Milit rushes for Paul Pritzker, storage in the penalty area. Good anticipation by Navas the goalkeeper. Quickly out to smother the attempted shot from Daniel Sturridge. Well, Sturridge said three or four good half chances. England on the attack again down the left side, but the ball is hooked high and beyond any white shirt inside the Costa Rican penalty area and cleared by Diaz. Here's Campbell. Campbell, he got the slightest of nudges there from Phil Jones, goes over and it's a free kick to Costa Rica. Sturridge hasn't quite shown that sharpness he certainly saw last season at club level. The ball came to him, just miscontrolled it. Maybe just took his eye off it for a second. Paul bounced up, hit his shin and Navas was out very, very quickly. A little bit surprised that a free kick wasn't given. Sturridge slid in, didn't catch the ball and caught the keeper who has now gone down. I assume from that challenge. Yes, I think so. Navas is a good goalkeeper. We're seeing it again. And someone will pick him up from Levante in Spain. Sturridge going to see him. Check that he's actually all right. But he's receiving treatment at the moment just on the edge of a six yard box. It's a beautiful day. Another apology of a game, unfortunately. At least the two other England games, you know, it's something about them, Danny. And this is what I don't understand. You've got nine players on the pitch. Won't really evolve in those two games. And now an opportunity to put a marker down. Say, look, this is what I can do at international level. This is what I can do at World Cup, you know, from a personal point of view, from a team point of view. Go out there and have a go. You know, as simple as that at the moment, it's just like, well, let's just see the game now. Get on the plane tomorrow and go home. You know, if they continue to play like this, the press back home has been vicious enough as it is. It's going to be even worse tomorrow if they'd have come out and had a go. Even if they've got beaten, I think the press would afforded a young team. A little bit of Curtis say, okay, inexperienced side, but had a go. Tried the right things at the moment. I'm finding it very, very difficult to pick out anything positive from this game. Well, I had my say about the criticism afforded to Steven Jarrod in some of the English news favourites this morning. But if they criticise this England performance, I'd be in agreement. They're so far is not a single redeeming feature of England's display here in the horizon. And this is what I mean. When we talk about identity, you say England difficult to beat, passionate, strong, robust, get the ball out wide, get crosses in, you know, play direct at times. There was a clear identity. You didn't need to see the England badge. You could watch the team play. I thought that's England as you could watch Spain or Brazil, you know, without the the coloured shirts and whatever it may be. And you knew what team was out there. You knew how they wanted to play England at the moment, whether it's confusion, whether they're caught, you know, in two or three minds of how to play. I don't know. But at the moment, it really is rock bottom. Jones aggressively tackles the Costa Rican. It wasn't a far challenge England had the ball lamp to Lallana in the centre of the Costa Rican half. He's got Milner towards this near flight. The England right. Milner moves in field. There are four white shirts ahead of them and he picks out Lallana. Lallana pulls the cross back but only to a red shirt. And he's smashed away to safety by Costa Rica. Further cleared by them, picked up by Wiltshire. Wiltshire with the deep cross to the far side. Brought under control, was it? Not quite under control. And it should be run away by Costa Rica. And needlessly, because Costa Rica were in fair possession, the referee blows his whistle for a free kick to Costa Rica. Well, Costa Rica has to be a little bit careful as well, because if they were going to go, if they were to go one nil behind, if they went one nil behind and then suddenly, you know, Italy get a goal, for instance, I think it would only one more goal after that. So I think, you know, Costa Rica are still going to defend properly. They are playing at 80%. You know, then they're not certainly they're not playing full tilt in this game. They're trying to conserve as much energy as possible, not getting any cards, not getting any injuries. But you know, they can't afford to lose this game. Yeah, if you're trying to work out the mathematics, obviously Costa Rica have six points at the start of this game. Italy and Uruguay, both three points each. In terms of goal difference, Costa Rica have plus three. Italy have zero their level in terms of goal difference. Uruguay minus one. So that's still an advantage to Costa Rica. Even should they lose this game? And there's a positive result in the other match in Natalic still. Italy nil, Uruguay nil. England in possession here with Frank Lampard on his last display for England. Flicks the pass towards the right side and Jones takes his eye off the ball and it bounces behind him out for a throw in. Wollful. I really wanted to be positive today. All these changes, as Danny's been saying, so many young players out there. And you can think of Jones and Smalling in defense and Sean defense. It's not inconceivable they will be part of England's back four in terms of the European Championship at France in two years time. We want to be positive that at the moment, there is no reason to be positive. Exactly. They're giving us no opportunity to be positive and that's the most disappointing thing. England now have the ball and it's over the halfway line. Sturridge furthest forward. It's in now to Wilshire and Wilshire. It falls over under a challenge, a third challenge, and he's still down in his knees. Every time Jack Wilshire goes down, you wonder is he going to get up? It's disperning. Diaz for Costa Rica on the near side, just chips it into the chest of Frank Lampard. He loses it for Jones. Back to Cahill and Cahill into Barkley on the halfway line inside the centre circle. Typically, he's a simple pass on to the left side of Shaw and he plays it behind Lookshaw. Lookshaw with Barkley available again and it goes to the Everett and Midfield play. Back now, the smaller. I don't know what the England fans have paid to be here, but they deserve better than this tepid fur from the country. Again, the ball given away by England. Goodness, that looked like a foul on the far side of the field. By Shaw, is that going to be another yellow card? England are giving the ball away under no pressure today. The Costa Ricans aren't really steaming in. They're not forcing England to give the ball away. England are just making too many unforced errors at present. This is what I said the other night. Under pressure, England cannot keep the ball today. They can't keep it with no pressure. I watched obviously the Chile, the Holland game, the Brazil game. They play at a fierce tempo at times. Really quick movement, really quick with the ball, but they play with ultimate quality. Look at the way Robbins set up the last goal on the counterattack. It was fantastic, but he got into there at full speed and had the composure to wrap his foot round the ball and just cut it back across goal. We'll get an update from Conor McNamara in Natal in a moment where it's still 0-0 between Italy and Uruguay. Bilanus has got to come on as a substitute for Costa Rica. Rather a surprise that he was left out today. Costa Rica hit the fallout field, straight into England's possession, deep inside the England half. Let's go to Conor. Still Italy 0, Uruguay 0, with Balotelli going off at halftime. They've brought on a midfielder in Marco Perolo. Pat Nevins alongside me. 0-0 will do Italy, Pat. Yes, I absolutely love that. They seem to do that. They can possibly break. They will break, but I did see a little bit on the darkouts are shown by Italy. There are no lack of hard tackles in the darkouts from the Uruguay defenders either. Suarez has not had a shooting opportunity in the penalty area and he's been resorted to attempting free kicks of goal from long range, but you feel one chance for Suarez could change everything here. Italy 0, Uruguay 0. Uruguay must win to be sure it going through. England have just picked up a second booking here. La Lana deservedly yellow carded for a crude challenge on Brande Ruiz. Goodness, it's going from bad to worse. 12 minutes gone in the second half. Listen to Five Live, your World Cup station. Brazil 2014. This is miserable fair though. Not our fault. Costa Rican ill, England ill. Costa Rican free kick. Played deep looking for the run of Diaz into the England penalty area, but it's headed away by Jones, cleared by Milner to the halfway line. Wiltshire goes down again. He was far tackled on this occasion. Immediately clutches the back of his right hip and gets to his feet finally after England have already taken the free kick. Here's Lampard giving away. Campbell for Costa Rica. Little bit of room inside the England half. Slips it forward, but that's too far away from Borges through to Ben Foster. Ben Foster pulls it out under R. Milanus hasn't come on. He's sat down again. So anyway, play has continued. 13 minutes into the second half here. That's a good ball forward. Lelana is there. Deceptive by the dive forward by Navas the goalkeeper. By the first time England have got behind the Costa Rican defence, Lelana down the left hand side didn't quite have that final bit of quality to pick out Daniel Sturridge. Tried to roll it across the face of goal. Maybe just needed to dink it over top of the keeper and give Daniel Sturridge a head. It's chance. Milanus is waiting for the next interruption in play before the striker can enjoy more play with his teammates who are heading for the last 16 of the World Cup here. Brazil 2014 and really, you know, they're not having to use any excess energy here. We talk about the danger of yellow cars. Frankly, it doesn't matter for them. They haven't got a single player in the starting 11 on a yellow car. Now, Milanus is going to replace Drenes, who replaced him in the starting 11. I think Costa Rican are just trying to save legs, trying to save energy. It's been quite easy for them, isn't it? Back four has been untroubled. England have not got in behind the Costa Rican back four, back five at all. I mean, it's been far too easy for the Costa Rican defence. Barkley gives the ball away again. Fortunately, get it back on the halfway line. Find Sean the far side in the sunshine down the England left and towards Barkley. Barkley, oh, he was dropped down. Here's a free kick to England. It's going to be a yellow card for the defender Gonzalez. And here's an opportunity for Frank Lampard. Crew challenged by Gonzalez. Barkley picked the ball up, started running the defenders. First time he's really done that. Just knocked it past Gonzalez, who just left a leg there really, and Barkley went over it. Now, probably Frank Lampard has a decent chance from 25 yards out. Yeah, he's got to hit the target. Test the goalkeeper. It would be fantastic for Frank. We'd love it. Really, as a consolation, you know, just to get him to that 30-goal mark, you know, on his, well, it's obviously going to be his last cap. Right. 30 minutes left for play. The wall has to be back the full 10 yards. Lallana's standing there as well, but it's got to be Lampard. Leave it to Lampard. Yes, Lallana moves slain to the left and away from the free kick. Here's Lampard's right foot, drill low into the wall. It's in the penalty here, with such disappointment again for England. Sturridge tries to weave his way into a dangerous area, but there's a foul on the defender. And that, oh, there's been a sending off in Natal. Colin McNamara. Well, this is interesting now. Italy are down to 10 men. Marchizio has been sent off. Claudio Marchizio, he was in possession of the ball. He tried to skip away from Iguido Aravallo. And as the ball was taken away from him, he stamped down on the calf of the Uruguayan, and the referee, Pat Nevin, showed a straight red card. It seems a little bit harsh, but the studs were high. He's gone over the top of the ball. It has caught the other player. And in actual fact, by the letter of the law, yes, you can give him a straight red for that, but there have been worse challenges today. What a chance for Uruguay there against 10 men now. If they can score one goal, it could be enough to bring them through to the last 16. Italy only need the draw, and it's Italy 0 Uruguay 0. 17 minutes into the second half, Roy Hodgson makes a change. Raheem Sterling replaces Adam Lalana. Let's see a bit more urgency. Certainly Sterling should provide that, but not when England give the ball away as they've done again. That's so rare, Frank Lampard, to do that. But not for the first time today. His pass was errant, and there's a mistake too by Jones. Here's the run forward by Balanas. Balanas shot is well saved, comfortably saved by Ben Foster. Well, luckily for Ben Foster, it was well within comfortable range of him, but it was a mistake by Jones, giving the ball away again unnecessarily to Brian Norris and Costa Rica. Serge forward on the attack, and it was a strike from distance. Comfortable in the end for Foster, but could have been worse. Sterling down the left side, on to Sterling, and Sterling midway inside the Costa Rican half. Oh my goodness. He's not under any pressure, and he runs the ball out of play. Let's get an update from Wimbledon. Russell Fuller. Serena Williams has taken the first set, 6-1 against Anna Tattish-Villy here on centrecourt, Allen while on number one court, Eugenie Bouchard leading Daniella, had to cover by Asset Talavich, five games all in the second. Thanks very much, Russell. You haven't missed anything here. Costa Rica nil, England nil on five-lie. Brando Ruiz, good ball out to the left side, and Balanas. Balanas looks as if he wants to make an early impact, he's running forward towards the penalty area. Good tackle coming in from Phil Jones, cleared by Milner, and on via Wiltshire to the far side through Barclay to Shaw, Shaw moves over the halfway line, pass infield to Raheem Sterling, and Sterling back to Lampard inside the centre circle. Wiltshire again, on to the right side of Milner, a storage for this forward, for England. Milner looking to find Wiltshire, telegraph the pass, intercepted by Costa Rica's Diaz, and run away to safety towards the halfway line. Balanas again, a muscle out of it by Milner, that's better. James Milner then gives it away. I'm glad we didn't keep a count on the number of times England had given the ball away, without being under undue pressure, it would be embarrassing. And Pat Murphy's at the cricket. The last England pair of hung on for 10 overs now, Anderson yet to score, Mohan Ali inside of his first test match, 100 on 96. There are 10 overs to go for Sri Lanka to get one more wicket. The score is irrelevant, 236 for nine. Lampard for England, back to Smalling, and Smalling hammers it towards the right side, accurately played to Milner. Milner back to Sturridge. There has been a little more urgency about England in the last few minutes. Sturridge and to Milner, back to Sturridge! Sturridge, shot inches wide on the far post. First good little bit of interchange of passing on the edge of the Costa Rican, 18-yard box. Sturridge, a little step over, good little one-two, kept himself on side, opened his body up, thinking to bend that into the far corner on his strong left foot, and missed it by about a foot. You know, that's been sadly the tournament for Daniel Sturridge. I think it's been difficult. He's had some good chances. I know he got his goal, but he really whipped that ball across. But when he's had those moments to hit the target, it just hasn't quite happened for him, is it? Well, Joel Campbell has been taken off here by Costa Rica, and he's been replaced by a defender. Urana, Costa Rica, just perhaps making sure that they don't lose the game. The point will ensure that they top the group. Remember, it's still 0-0, Italy in Uruguay, Italy down to 10 men. Even more intent on defending now, Italy. Balls on the halfway line with England. 20 minutes gone in the second half. Lampard initially lost the ball, but he was helped out there by Barclay. Back it goes to Keir, and on now to Barclay, edge of the centre circle. Lampard. Barclay's getting deeper and deeper as an Allen. You know, searching for the ball, you know, trying to just get himself on the ball a little bit more. That's a terrible, terribly awkward pass from Smalling for Jones to take, and Jones couldn't control it, but Jones is back there to prevent any further danger for England. Retreating in toward his penalty area, and then spins and puts it out for a throw into Costa Rica. It's a good time to remind the listeners. Lyons now open for 6-0-6, 0-500, 9-0-9, 6-9-3. I'd like to hear, you know, what should England's identity be? Because clearly today they haven't got one. Is Roy Hodgson the right man for the job? If he's not, then realistically, who would you like to see as the next England manager? Right, Costa Rica. Give the ball away to England. Sterling to Wiltshire on the halfway line. Sterling's available again. There goes the pass. Wiltshire scurries past him, down the left side. Sterling looks infield instead to Sturridge back towards Sterling, headed clear by Costa Rica. Was that a hand up by Jack Wiltshire? It was, and it's a free kick to Costa Rica. I think Jack Wiltshire tried to get his hands out the way, sort of held his hands up to say, look, I don't want to handball it, but it did hit his hand. Stopped the ball from going forward in a free kick, and chance for Costa Rica to slow the game down again. Some quick news from Conor in the towel. Well, there's been a huge chance for Louis Suarez and Uruguay. Still 0-0. Cavani threaded the ball through. Suarez in the penalty area, toe poked it, and Gianluigi Buffon made a very important save. Pat Nevin. Do you know what? If you want one team, and that's all planted to save you with 10-0, it's Sterling. They're standing in front of me right now. They've got every chance to do it, but they will be under pressure. 10-man Italy-0. Uruguay-0 at the moment. Italy go through. And it's 0-0 here in Bellahorazonte between Costa Rica and England, midway through the second half to administer the last right for England's World Cup. Mike Ng. Thank you, Alan. And I think I can't remember what was Daniel Chris said earlier in the program, that what we're looking at, and particularly now Sterling is on, is we're looking really at the nucleus of the team England would expect to field in two years' time. Probably World Cup will come into it, and maybe Young Stones as well. But there's a big strong nucleus there of players that Roy Hodgson would be hoping to take to France. It's better for England in the second half. Costa Rica filtering players back inside their own half once more, and we're looking at Schor over on the left-hand side, making a mistake, and Costa Rica coming on a break, playing it rather halfheartedly for themselves towards Arena, who's come on for Campbell. But the fact that they've taken Campbell off now as well, I think they've probably got one eye on their last 16 game. They don't know who they'll be playing yet, of course. England nil, Costa Rica nil. Nil-nil between Italy and Uruguay. Sturridge gives chase. He was so close to scoring in this game in the second half, Costa Rica just lumped the ball out of defence. But remember, if Italy go through, Marquisio will be out of the game, and so too will Balotelli. Marquisio has been sent off. Balotelli's picked up his second yellow card. England now with Sterling. Forward for Sturridge. Sturridge has a chance to run up the Costa Rican goal. Sturridge goes forward, and he's won a corner. The defender had a bit of a hack really at him as well, could easily have conceded a penalty, but the ball has gone out of play, and England have a corner far side. I thought Sturridge was in. Clearly going to have a shot on goal. Just had a little bit of hesitation. It doesn't seem to have that sharpness, that confidence to run up people. It wasn't a penalty. He allowed the defender to get back. He got a touch on the ball, and then he went over. Good referee in. But he was ahead of the defender, wasn't he? He allowed the defender to get back. We haven't seen that for Liverpool this season. The game is there for England to win. It's 0-0 against Costa Rica. England have a corner kick over on the far side, which Barclay will take. It's the usual pushing and shoving going on in the penalty area. Cahill trying to get away from his marker, and in goes the corner kick. Out comes the keeper. Gets a good fist to it. Wilshard tries to pick up the loose ball on the edge of the area. Costa Rica don't clear. Wilshard's taken another knock, and now Sterling's made a mistake. But Costa Rica only a reiner at the moment in possession. But the ball will go down to Ruiz now over on that right-hand side of the field. There's danger here for Costa Rica. For England, they get the cross in, and Sterling's challenge was late. Ball's gone behind that. Danny's been talking about this for some time now. This turnover. When England are in attack, they lose possession, and suddenly Costa Rica break, and they win a corner over on the far side. Well, well then, Raheem Sterling for chasing back. I think he was lucky not to give away a free kick. But Jack Wilshard's gone down again. Every single... I don't want to pick on the player, but every single time he gets tackled, he goes down for a length of time. I don't know whether this is a mental issue, whether it's a physical issue, I'm not sure. Costa Rica corner. Far side. Foster's not got it first time, but the whistle's going to go against the Costa Rican, and we'll go down to Ian Dennis Pickside. Stephen Gerrard's coming on, Mike. He's just been warming up behind this goal that I'm sat behind Pickside here for five lives. He's just gone down to the tunnel. He's quickly emerged, and Stephen Gerrard, possibly maybe for the last time, is 114th cap for his country, and also sat in front of this England support. The England fans behind me are the only bright spot from this thoroughly frustrating afternoon. Their support has been awesome. Well, I wonder what we read into this, this moment where Gerrard will come on to win his 114th cap. It's one behind David Beckham. He'll join Frank Lampard, or maybe Lampard will come off. We'll wait and see, but Gerrard is being prepared, and James Milner, we feel, is the player who's going to make way. England nil, Costa Rica nil. England have been better in the last 10 minutes. Sturridge really should have done better. Gerrard is waiting to come on. I'll get Danny to try and interpret this introduction of Stephen Gerrard in a moment. Borough Frecaforza is not going to get on the pitch this World Cup, and now Costa Rica with Boulanas juggling with the ball, and then Diaz finds Boulanas once more, and the ball will go to the far side, and there's lots of space down that right hand side now for Gamboa. Plays it short to Brian Ruiz, England on the back foot here. Ruiz ball into the area, not cleared yet, and now it's lumped to safety over on the far side, and now we wonder whether this might be the last time we see Stephen Gerrard. He's coming on for Jack Wilshire, who got the injury a few moments ago. So Wilshire says farewell to the World Cup. Danny, the official word is that neither Roy Hodgson nor Stephen Gerrard know exactly what lies in store, but he's coming on. Would you, any interpretation? Well, I think he's given him the chance that this may well be his swanson. I think that'll be, he's given him the opportunity. Okay, the back end of the season, we know, didn't go quite as well as he wanted it to. The two England games haven't gone as expected, but he has been a magnificent servant over the years for England, and I think this will be an opportunity, may well be his last game, and I think first and foremost he can raise those last two games, if you like, hopefully go out on a little bit of positive, applaud the fans after the end of the game, haven't actually played a part in the game. Well, that was well won by England at the back, Jones. Milner, though, is easily pushed aside down this near side by Borges, who's a really strong player in midfield, and now that's a good ball played forward by Takeda and Costa Rica, who have revived themselves. Get the ball in from the far side of the field and England header, it's not gone for a corner. Smalling has to be careful with his clearance, Barkley on the edge of the area, and then Shaw, and Takeda was late on Shaw as he cleared. Well, England fans will know that for the last decade or so there's always been talk of the fact that suggestions that Lampard and Gerrard can't play together in the same England team, well now they are possibly finishing their England careers together on the field here at the World Cup, and they're going to have over 15 minutes to enjoy themselves. And Frank Lampard has just given Stephen Gerrard the armband, maybe a little bit belatedly, obviously, easing the captain a decent gesture from Frank Lampard. Well, he said Stephen Gerrard to us, talking to Ian Dennis that he was broken and hurt, and really hurting after what had happened in the first two games. Can he just sign off here with something special for England? Back again to Pat Murphy at the Test match. The last pair are still together, Anderson's still on Nort, he's faced 35 balls, Mohin's stuck on 96, he's got that conundrum, does he stick or twist? Can he get that extra four for his first Test match century? Eight overs to go, Anderson and Panasar batted through 13 to save the Test against Australian Cardiff. This would mean these two would go through 20 overs to save this match. They've gone through 12, eight to go, 236 for nine, Mike. Thank you, Pat. You're listening to Five Live from Bella Horizonte, England nil, Costa Rica nil, Sterling goes down that far side, the field fed by Sturridge, he'll just keep the ball in by the corner flag and in the end wins the corner. We'll go to Ian Dennis in a moment pitch side. I said to Danny a few moments ago we could be looking at the England team in two years time on the pitch, not now. We've got Lampard and Gerrard together in midfield and Gerrard is going to take this England corner and he sluts the England fans over on the far side who are giving the team incredible support under the circumstances. Gerrard now with his England corner kick nil nil against Costa Rica and here comes the corner whipped in by the captain to the far post and Lampard off balance couldn't get it forward and here's Ian Dennis pitch side. Yeah, that was a terrific ovation for Stephen Gerrard as he went to take that corner kick and England are about to make their third and final substitution. We've had Sterling, we've had Gerrard now, and to Wayne Rooney. Indeed, Wayne Rooney is coming on for James Milner. So Milner and Wilshire have been replaced. Sterling is on for the Lana. On comes Wayne Rooney who at last has scored of course at a World Cup in that game against Uruguay and Rooney comes on to win his 95th cap and like Luis Suarez in that game scored his 40th international goal as well. England nil Costa Rica nil. Scoreline stay like this then Costa Rica top the group. Italy will finish second. That Italy down to 10 men against Uruguay drawing nil nil. Marquisio having been sent off and here's a well we've got a Conor McNamara in a minute just England building in front of us down the right hand side. Sterling's come across to the right. So England have Rooney on, they have Gerrard on, they have Sterling on as well. Lampard's trying to win the ball in midfield but now Boulanas gets Costa Rica out of their own half and the ball is played back to Ben Foster. Costa Rica will make a change in a moment. Let's go back to that Uruguay-Italy game and Conor McNamara. Still scoreless Italy now playing with a flat back five as they look to hold on with the 10 men against Uruguay here. We've had a long delay for an injury to Verati which could stretch us into several minutes of injury time at the end and Pat Nevin alongside me. Uruguay have got to get it to Suarez in the penalty area. Yeah and Suarez is just going up. He's playing against three or four defenders so he's not getting much space. It's a tackle against defense. Italy aren't even attempting the attack now. Mott has come on as another defender. Here's a chance but they can't get to it. The Uruguay winds up in the penalty area. Italy clear away. Italy 0. Uruguay 0. Michael Barantes will come on in a moment for Costa Rica but what's already grabbed my attention. Gerard's only been on the field three or four minutes but he's already trying to get forward. There's so much of the season of course he's had this anchor role. He's playing alongside Frank Lampard but Lampard seems to be the man sitting and Gerard is the man making the runs. So Barantes comes on for Costa Rica. He comes on for Borges and we have less than 15 minutes to go. Danny Mills. Well I think Stephen Gerard probably wants to finish on a high. Very very disappointed up until now in obviously with this World Cup. He'll want to go out with a decent performance. Maybe even nick himself a goal and give the fans something to cheer about. But not just on that. Obviously a reminder that the lines are open for 606. 0.500. 909. 6.93. Where do England go from here? What is their identity and if Roy Hodgson isn't the right man for the job then realistically who do you think it should be? Well Costa Rica haven't turned on the style today that they showed against Italy in Uruguay but of course those six points have already put them through. Long ball from Stephen Gerard and what a ball it was. He finds Raheem Sterling down on this right hand side. Rooney's calling for the ball and Sterling didn't deliver it. Sterling should have done that earlier and Costa Rica clear. They're only leaving one man down field at the moment. They're very much playing for this draw. Costa Rica they will know what's going on in the game running simultaneously Uruguay 0. Italy 0 in Natal. And at the moment Costa Rica are sort of inviting England onto them really. Shore over on the left hand side. Barclay calling for it. England sense that they could at least get a victory here today. Gerard again looking to release Sterling down this nizzle. It's another great ball from Gerard and this time Sterling lays it off to Sturridge. Rooney wants the ball square. He's played into trouble though. There were too many defenders around him and there's Costa Rica try and break. They don't play it well enough to Balaanus and out comes Ben Foster, an England builder game from the back. We have to remember though English forwards has been a little bit better in the second half. Costa Rica happy with the draw. Rooney on the chest. Wayne Rooney half thought about a shot. Now he tries to take the goalkeeper and the goalkeeper saw that coming waited for it to come down. It tipped it over the bar. England playing their best football of the game at least. Ending this world cup with a little bit of a flourish but it's 0-0 here on 5-5. England have a corner kick over on the far side. What would be very interesting of course in this game would be if there was a score in the Uruguay-Italy game. How that would affect the Costa Ricans down. They want to win the group. Corner kick to England. Far side. Their left hand side. Cahill's made a run to the far post and it goes. Goalkeeper fisted out. Again not a good set piece from England and Sterling gives chase over on the far side but he hasn't got... Oh he's lucky a little bit there Sterling because the Costa Ricans has been penalised and England have a free kick. I think we might be going to corner in a minute. There's been a bit of a melee in the... Well Keeleney's moaning about something. He's showing everybody his shoulder. He's pulled his shirt down. It was a little bit of an elbow thrown by him. He was involved with Louis Suarez, Pugatch is maddened to me. Not quite sure what have happened but... Well... Wayne Rooney bursting down the England right hand side. We'll go to the Italy Uruguay game in a moment. We'll go now because that move is broken down. Let's go to Conor McNamara. Oh Mike there is high controversy here. Louis Suarez has collided with Keeleney the Italian defender. Now from a distance it looks like a headbutt on Keeleney's shoulder but Keeleney is suggesting that Louis Suarez has bit him. Now we know that there is history in this with Louis Suarez. Keeleney pulled his jersey off his shoulder pointing to his teeth and pointing to his shoulder and Louis Suarez as he was recovering did have his mouth open and was rubbing his fingers inside his mouth as if he had hurt his teeth. We've yet to see conclusive evidence that he did bite him but what a story with Louis Suarez back involved and the accusation from a defender that Suarez has bit him. From what I've seen Mike that's a bite. The action I've only seen it from behind from one angle but his movement with his head is not a headbutt. For me that looks like a bite. If it is I'm sorry but that has to be the longest ban on the planet. Because of his history we must go back to Conor. Conor joined us straight away from the town. Go for Uruguay who leads 10 men Italy. Diego Gordine has scored from the corner just after Louis Suarez appeared to bite the Italian defender Keeleney and in the immediate aftermath of all of that Uruguay score and there's shades here of South Africa four years ago when Louis Suarez handled deliberately on the line and then the penalty was saved and the Uruguayans went through. Here Suarez has appeared to bite Keeleney and in the confusing aftermath the Italians have conceded at the set piece and it's the captain Diego Gordine it's Italy Neal, Uruguay won as things stand Pat Nevin, Italy are going out of the World Cup. You know they've defended so much and so well for most of this game but they were using a kept on saying the dark cars however the dark cars used against them there. Now whether or not Suarez has actually bit him he at least headbutted the defender. He's had to take a lot of stick all the way through the game but you cannot do that in particular if you hit Louis Suarez you cannot do that. It's a brilliant header from Gordine, it's a hugely important goal for Uruguay and their supporters are celebrating now against 10 men Uruguay lead Italy by a goal to Neal but we are going to be hearing about Louis Suarez and this alleged bite for a long time to come. Well we're watching England here but we're completely distracted now by what's going on in that particular game. That score line doesn't affect Costa Rica by the way at all. Costa Rica will still win the group. I'm intrigued by the fact that there'd be no replay shown of that incident. I mean that maybe tells a story. No replay shown and what about Gordine by the way? It was Gordine's header which won Atletico Madrid the La Liga against Barcelona in the New Camp and there he is today popping up to score the goal which could well take Uruguay into the last 16 and remember Uruguay began this competition without Suarez losing 3-1 to Costa Rica. Well sorry mate, we make no apologies for not talking about the England game because nothing's happening. When you look at this I'm just looking down, I think I'm Mark Buge's iPad. That looks like a bite to me. It's very very difficult to see behind but that looks like a definite movement towards the bite Kylini. Kylian was absolutely fuming. He threw out his arm immediately to elbow him and rightly so. If that's a bite that has to be the longest band in football ever and a worldwide band, not just an international band because that is absolutely disgraceful if that's the case. Well here in this game it's Nill Nill and Bellanas is trying to go forward for Costa Rica. More on that at Suarez in a moment. Here's Pat Murphy in the cricket. England have only 34 balls to survive. Anderson still hasn't scored, 39 balls he's faced but Mohen Alley has his century in his second test match. Magnificent performance, 247 for nine. I'm going to see two draws involving England at exactly the same time today. Thank you very much indeed Pat. No biting there then but we must go back to Conor because it's England Nill, Costa Rica Nill here but it's all happening in Natal, Italy and Uruguay. Conor McNamara. Free kick for Italy. Pirlo hits it through the wall and only just wide. It took a deflection on the way through and the Italians now scurry over to take a quarter. They are down to 10 men. They're on their way out of the World Cup and they're furious about it particularly with the man on the ball now Suarez who tries to come away. Cassano though tackles him and has played long into the penalty area again and the Italians can't get hold of it and they defended all the game pattern and now the Italians have to push forward and that's going to create space and he's gassed on Ramirez. Brilliant tackle on the edge of the penalty area. Absolutely fantastic. This game is not going to end quietly. It's absolutely mayhem now. The Italians are just throwing everyone. It's a completely and utterly opening game. They're opening game here and they have to attack but they haven't given many attackers on the field. They've taken most of them off the field now so they'll go for it. They're trying to get free kicks, corner kicks and maybe trying to attack them from there but what they're doing is they're leaving space at the back and you just you will not be surprised if Loew Suarez gets at least a chance between now and the end of the game. This is five line from the BBC in Natal where it is Italy nil. Uruguay won the goal scored by the Uruguayan captain Gaudin but all the controversy here about what looks to be yet another bite by Loew Suarez on the flesh of an opponent. The experienced Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini who was incensed. The two players came together. Chiellini sitting on the ground went perplexed towards the referee and pointing to his shoulder and pulling down the jersey to show you know presumably teat marks from where Suarez had this alleged bite on him and we want to be careful here. We've not seen an angle that absolutely confirms it but it does appear that Loew Suarez has bitten Chiellini and then immediately afterwards the Uruguayan scored down the other end here. Casano tries to thread a ball to Thiago Mota but he can't pick out his fellow Italian in the penalty area and it goes out for a throw in on the far side and the Uruguayans will take their time over. They're suddenly having chased the game for Silla. Nil Nil was no good to Uruguay but now they've got their noses in front and as things stand Costa Rica who are still nil nil with England and Uruguay will be going through out of this group and the two former winners of the World Cup Italy and England will be going out. Here is Pirlo on the ball midway inside the Uruguayan half on the right hand side scoops it into the penalty area Casano controls he's got his back to goal he's been ushered out of the penalty area just well to conjure any sort of a cross-up but it's intercepted and Aravalo should be able to clear it away takes his time and eventually they clear it and it goes out for a throw into Uruguay. Pat Neville. Yeah well and to be absolutely fair in Loew Suarez you're right we don't know absolutely if he's bitten the player but he has attempted to use his head on him he only reached the shoulder of Chiellini but you're not allowed to do that anyway put that in context he's had rough house tactics on him from all those three centre-backs all afternoon continually they've been pulling them they've been jumping into them they've been tackling from the back he has had a really hard time and he's trying to hold it and hold it and hold it but obviously he's let go there and you just cannot let that happen. Having said that it's still excitement here there's only a few minutes to go anything could happen but Italy have to go for it. Well Felicitas at home it's an incredible atmosphere in Natal we've got blue skies overhead warm temperatures not the oppressive humidity that Italy played England in Manausa against but here they are with 10 men after Marquisio was sent off for a straight red card and they are under huge pressure now the Italians. Pirlo gives it to Casano on the right hand side all the way to the byline little nutmeg into the box very strong defending though and again it's Aravalo who clears the ball away up towards Cavani and Cavani strong in the tackle and he passes it to Suarez who's got to run to the penalty area there's only one defender back Suarez tries to pass and it's intercepted brilliant defending from the Italians Suarez picks it up again little nutmeg on the edge of the box shifts his weight onto his left foot but he can't get the shot clear and once again Louis Suarez at a World Cup is the pantomime villain the Italians are giving him the dirtiest of looks and he's trying to punish them even further one nil Uruguay lead here Italy in possession they have it in the centre with Barolo who came on for Balotelli at half time that was taking off a striker bringing on a midfielder as the Italians were looking to close the game and keeping it nil nil but now there's an urgency because they have to chase it there's a man free of the back post heavy touch though and he wasn't able to come in it was Darmian who had come forward heavy heavy touch and it was taken away from him and cleared away yeah I'm just waiting for the assistant down there to tell us how long there is left now but there must be a whole bunch of time out there has to be left in this game purely because of the fact that there'd be so many stoppages for a multitude of reasons Italy nil Uruguay won still nil nil in the England game against Costa Rica as England's campaign limps its way towards a close as Gaston Ramirez here passes the ball back and Jimenez is in position to wallop away and anywhere will do for Uruguay now they've got Suarez up front at his own Kevani is loitering in midfield everyone else is playing as a defender as Uruguay are clinging on to what they hope will be a first-ever World Cup win against Italy and a place in the second round we've only got 10 seconds of the 90 minutes remaining Cassada rolls it into the penalty area Godine makes an important interception ball comes back in again and it's headed away this time by Casares and it's a good header Uruguay have possession they're just on the edge of their own penalty area Gaston Ramirez is fouled that will relieve a bit of pressure and it's a free kick to Uruguay with five five minutes to be added on for stoppage time well you know Pat Nevin I was in South Africa at the last World Cup when Uruguay beat Ghana and those controversial circumstances and Luis Suarez was at the heart of it and it wasn't that he scored the winning goal but it was this sort of curious altercation in the game when he had that handball and he was shown the straight red card and I remember he hung around in the tunnel and he celebrated when the penalty was missed and it looks like a similar sort of role that Suarez has played here committing what what looks to be a bite on Keolini and Uruguay score straight afterwards yeah and it's not that people are never going to shut up but this one I have to say I was furious at that Ghana one because it was so against the spirit of the game but so many people would do it and at the moment I mean the Italians if if they do last these last five minutes to Uruguay and say to you what the Italians are going to do with this referee they will be absolutely all over them they're furious with them just now they've actually kept a level of control because there's no point in panicking now they need to get on with it they are going out of the World Cup simple as that they must have a go to for the next four minutes or so somehow get a corner get a free kick somewhere 20 yards out get it to pillow's feet and you might have a chance to get back in this World Cup well in the immediate aftermath of the Suarez incident there was a close-up on his face and it looked like he was nursing his teeth he was rubbing his teeth in his gums as if he'd actually hurt them now maybe he's saying you know it's like a headbutt scenario and he's been headbutted or shouldered in the mouth and he's feeling the pain there but it's all added to the drama as Italy sent in another low cross this time from Tiscaiglio from the left-hand side but he can't pick out a teammate and it's back now on the half well as Suarez goes down and he gets no sympathy from the Italians referee isn't interested either here come Italy again midway inside the Uruguayan half strong challenge comes in from Aravalo and the Uruguayan's regained possession it's up to Suarez again and a cushioned first touch to Gaston Ramirez and this is where the extra man helps the Uruguayans they've got space down there on the pitch Cavani on the left-hand side we've played two of the five minutes of stoppage time here in Natal on five live Suarez is on the ball again he's just outside the penalty area he doesn't want to attack though this is about killing the game now for Uruguay back to Suarez again on the right-hand side Wallops it off an opponent comes back to him again from Tiscaiglio Aravalo with a run into the penalty area this could finish it all now and he just let the ball slip away from him and Suarez is furious he said why did you attack we're trying to kill the game off you've given the Italians the ball again Casano though gives it away and now possession with Tiscaiglio for Italy but he's inside his own half to Pirlo who so often the Italians look to to create something from nothing he's inside the center circle 10 men behind the ball for Uruguay just 10 men on the field for Italy it's so tense here the Uruguayan fans like tens of thousands of smurfs in their sky blue and white away to our right-hand side cheering and swirling scarves in the air but it's not over yet and they know that there is still two minutes of stoppage time to go Italy are on the attack left-hand side with Pirrolo he can't get it under his control and Aravalo clears the ball Bufon has come out of his penalty area and he's up to the halfway line and he don't even have the ball Pat Nevin he's playing right back I can't believe it well Gaster he's actually had two shots from his own half in this game but Eddie Casieris Bufon is out of his goal Cavani can't get into a position to shoot however and the Italians have possession and it is incredible World Cup drama here in Brazil the Italians could be joining England has been the two nations who go out of this group and as things stand that's what happening still it's all over by the way between Costa Rican England that is finished nil nil he's a chance no I can't believe it then put it into the box and just cross his now chance in there but Pirrolo couldn't get his forehead to it it was Godin the Uruguayan captain who scored the goal and made a brilliant serve now Suarez tries to shoot from close to the halfway line with Bufon well out of his goal and Suarez can't get it on target I can't believe he did it why is he doing that hold the ball I know you can score a goal there you get the ball down play and you're gonna you win you are through you win the game and you're into the next round all the Italians all the Italian substitutes are standing outside of the technical area one or two of them are on the pitch bat I would say it's definitely not all over surely now Bufon's got a got pillars on the ball you're 40 yards out get it in the mix up this is that you can imagine the seven seconds left in Italy hands will be clasped in fervent prayer this football crazy nation could be going out of the world cup here this could be their last chance Pirlo's free kick Hail Mary towards Bufon the goalkeeper goes down in the penalty area no penalty says the referee Bufon stays up in the attack Perolo has it on the right hand side Castorez regains possession for Uruguay and he wallops it off Perolo and it goes out and they want that to be that and the referee looks at his watch but it's not over yet I can't believe that before there's even going back he's in the it's he's having there is no goalkeeper for actually if the ball gets played up to Suarez he will have a tap and no I don't know if it's even going to get there this is the picture Uruguay have a throw in left full back position and the Italian goalkeeper is on the edge of the penalty area the Uruguay penalty area he's got four or five teammates behind him Suarez gets closer possession on the halfway line and finally the referee blows the final whistle in Natal and there's going to be blue murder from the Italians Louis Suarez once again is the centre of controversy here the goal came after 81 minutes from the captain Godin Uruguay have beaten Italy by a goal to nil and they progress but no matter where you are on this planet for the next 24 hours your television screens are going to be showing slow motion replays of the mouth of Louis Suarez connecting with the shoulder of Giorgio Chialini it will be intricately discussed as to whether he bit him the history of the player immediately brings that thought to your mind but until we get conclusive proof that never we will have to hold on either way it's enormous controversy apart from what he did there because he aimed his head towards the opponent it's ascending off anyway so whether he did bite him or not it should have been ascending off anyway but it was off the ball the officials didn't see it I'll tell you I didn't see it because it was so far off the ball every single Italian player every single Italian player has made his way to the referee and his assistant and his officials and as has Prandelli Prandelli's the last person he's just gone up to him as well now in actual fact they did it calmly they all walked up to him one after the other and shook his hand however I'm not sure what they said and I'm sure that it wasn't polite so nil nil between Costa Rica and England Italy have lost here to Uruguay in dramatic circumstances Pirlo with what looks to be a tear in his eye makes his way off the pitch and the Italians well there's bad blood about this no doubt at all but look at the Uruguay's path they're now going to celebrate with a huge contingent of their supporters coming to the game we saw guys in camper vans who've driven the length of Brazil Uruguay is on the southern border we're in Natal up in the north they have travelled so far and they will be staying in Brazil because Mark Pugac Uruguay have made it to the second round and Italy are out thank you very much indeed Connor all the drama is with Connor and it's at headingly back there very shortly with about two overs to go and England hanging on no drama here no excitement Danny Mills nothing to get excited about nil nil England's last game they go home with one point yeah disappointed we talked about it very very briefly no real identity no energy no real nothing really about the game at all but that bite is going to be absolutely crucial we've seen it we've seen the marks on Kealini's shoulder definitely look like teeth marks what is he doing what is he thinking it's not it's completely different to the game in South Africa I can accept him handballing it on the line and doing something good for his goal for his team I don't mind that even the celebrations but biting somebody not for the first time for the second time no for the third the third for the third time sorry yes third time that is outrageous for me that has to be an international ban not just an international level across all levels of football because that is absolutely disgraceful right we will keep a close eye on that there's a photograph on social media which definitely seems to show bite marks on Kealini's shoulder right to Pat Murphy at headingly 11 balls left the last pair are still together Anderson has batted 50 balls for naught not out Moen Ali 108 not out can England keep them out 11 balls left ball by ball five live sports extra Pat what drama you've had at Natal and obviously we've got two stories here Uruguay going through but Suarez and this picture on social media which certainly seems to show that it is a bite it wasn't a head bite what was your reading of it the reading of it the play was miles away from it was away over the left hand side it was between us and the ball but there was no interest in looking down at him but because he laid down then he rolled about and Kealini was rolling about and then Suarez was rolling about but as soon as you seen a reaction from the Italian players you thought oh dear he's done something wrong I have to say he's gone towards him with his teeth whether he has bitten or not but he has gone and it may have ended up being ahead but I cannot tell you for sure but it's a dreadful reaction now I have to be honest with him be utterly fair with Lewis Suarez he got a hell of a hard afternoon this afternoon he was kicked he was chased he was pulled he was everything all afternoon and he hadn't reacted up until those last few minutes but he reacted again allowed to do that so whether whatever he did be a bite and if it is a bite don't worry I'm with you Danny out you go and for a hell of a long time but even if it wasn't he's put his head on him you can't do that in this game so he will be suspended for the next game anyway but that's happened before didn't seem to affect him did it have a look at the five live at a twitter account you will be able to see the bite marks on Kealini's shoulder in terms of the football Pat Italy beating that in Manaus and then lose the next two and don't go through how surprised are you by what you've seen today well you just look at the start of this campaign who did you think was going to go through",
