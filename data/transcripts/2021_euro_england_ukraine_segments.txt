[0.00 - 8.56] P:1538.11 E:0.285810 |  Well thank you Mark and good evening to you 19 down, 5 to go and still the dream is intact.
[8.56 - 13.60] P:1616.52 E:0.310428 |  Last four days have changed the mood, tangible substance added to the wistful hopes of glory,
[13.60 - 17.60] P:1738.52 E:0.284639 |  the unseasonably cold summer air laced with optimism and further.
[17.60 - 19.60] P:1358.26 E:0.263908 |  Whisper it quietly if you dare.
[19.60 - 22.40] P:1459.83 E:0.295731 |  It is starting to feel quite real.
[22.40 - 27.56] P:1815.12 E:0.258264 |  The Germany game saw to that, a night that was pragmatic and cathartic in equal measure.
[27.56 - 32.92] P:1633.82 E:0.299641 |  The end justifying the means with the beautiful bedlam within Wembley mirrored around the country.
[32.92 - 38.92] P:1736.50 E:0.286597 |  A result that will live long in the memory in a way in which few Tuesday tea times ever will again.
[38.92 - 44.04] P:1608.86 E:0.252365 |  Sweet success, sweet Caroline, the sweetest of days.
[44.04 - 47.40] P:1757.71 E:0.286609 |  Locking Germany out of a tournament felt like a significant watershed moment.
[47.40 - 52.36] P:1601.29 E:0.260699 |  It was for one game, nearly the middle step on the journey at large.
[52.36 - 56.92] P:1695.74 E:0.291389 |  Tonight the task is to guarantee that the seemingly eternal wait isn't prolonged
[56.92 - 60.52] P:1794.43 E:0.270276 |  in the eternal city to ensure that all roads don't lead to Rome.
[60.52 - 68.28] P:1754.48 E:0.232929 |  But at the end of the clash London's calling, foundations laid for a potentially historic week under the arch.
[68.28 - 70.12] P:1865.68 E:0.312125 |  But these are heady Ukrainian days too.
[70.12 - 76.12] P:1699.95 E:0.280134 |  A first-ever European quarter-final secured with pride and persistence and almost the last touch against Sweden.
[76.12 - 79.72] P:1837.32 E:0.270601 |  Tonight the biggest game of their lives on the international stage.
[79.72 - 83.24] P:1700.59 E:0.264292 |  Their country's first visit to the last aid of major competition.
[83.24 - 88.36] P:1733.98 E:0.277878 |  Since they succumbed to Italy on a tough night in Hamburg in the 2006 World Cup.
[88.36 - 94.28] P:1694.45 E:0.270726 |  Andreshevchenko played that night and he featured in their only ever win against England three years later.
[94.28 - 100.52] P:1785.60 E:0.262876 |  Now recast from master marksman to mastermind, he's named this team for tonight's encounter.
[100.52 - 106.12] P:1653.36 E:0.258056 |  It's Busz Czannengol, Karabayev Sabani, Krasov, Matvienko, Mikolenko.
[106.12 - 111.32] P:1671.49 E:0.259859 |  Zinchenko, Szilvac, Shaparenko, Yarmolenko and Yaremchuk.
[111.40 - 118.20] P:1648.38 E:0.268937 |  Against the England side who revert to a back four from a three, Pickford, Walker Stones, McGuire Shaw,
[118.20 - 122.68] P:1667.50 E:0.211145 |  Philipsson Rice, Sancho Manstirling and Kane.
[122.68 - 126.68] P:1777.51 E:0.243063 |  And those England players before kickoff take the knee.
[129.72 - 135.32] P:1881.72 E:0.270599 |  England's footballing history is a tale of one high, the odd nearness, the occasional aberration.
[135.32 - 139.00] P:1829.38 E:0.273645 |  All punctuated by a myriad of quarter-final defeats.
[139.00 - 148.36] P:1723.07 E:0.237913 |  But remember Wembley 66 and 96, remember Naples and Samara and hope that Rome will soon be mentioned in the same breath.
[148.36 - 157.16] P:1672.56 E:0.240233 |  Because if England beat Ukraine, only Denmark will stand between them in the first major final in 55 years.
[157.16 - 165.16] P:1606.19 E:0.266361 |  England in white shirts and it might be the purest in me, but how great to see them in white shirts and dark blue shorts.
[165.32 - 170.28] P:1563.22 E:0.281670 |  They could give them right to left in this first half with Ukraine in all the other.
[170.28 - 175.64] P:1576.13 E:0.257794 |  And it is England with the early feel of the ball, playing it down for Raheem Sterling.
[175.64 - 180.28] P:1597.38 E:0.265955 |  In towards Luke Shaw and a long sleeve shirt, one of the few that is.
[180.28 - 183.72] P:1461.10 E:0.248080 |  Back from him to Harry McGuire and now John Stones.
[183.72 - 188.76] P:1484.02 E:0.260495 |  And then played out towards the right hand side where Karl Walker can receive possession.
[188.76 - 194.44] P:1520.24 E:0.255381 |  Over on that far touch line which is almost a bus ride away from here.
[194.76 - 199.72] P:1597.23 E:0.274731 |  Loft advantage point right at the back of the west end of the Stadio Olympic.
[199.72 - 203.72] P:1591.69 E:0.287814 |  And England play for Dad Awards Luke Shaw around the edge of the penalty area.
[203.72 - 206.28] P:1549.82 E:0.254337 |  Sterling trying to get the ball into feet.
[206.28 - 209.56] P:1691.95 E:0.275001 |  Couldn't take it with him as he turned and Ukraine will get it away.
[209.56 - 211.64] P:1776.42 E:0.299771 |  And it's a long ball, launch forward upfield.
[211.64 - 215.88] P:1535.50 E:0.247994 |  Lucky for Yama Lenkova, straight out of play for an England throw.
[215.88 - 221.16] P:1700.15 E:0.286895 |  Very positive compose, opening 90 seconds of the game here on Tortsport.
[221.88 - 225.80] P:1794.03 E:0.270130 |  Ukraine and England might be falling here in Italy, I know it isn't back home.
[225.80 - 229.72] P:1780.43 E:0.260681 |  Raheem's delighted to say we're joined by the former England captain,
[229.72 - 231.72] P:1646.83 E:0.248628 |  Stuart Pierce. Good evening Stuart.
[231.72 - 234.68] P:1689.23 E:0.309316 |  Evening Jim, just looking at the Ukrainian lineup there.
[234.68 - 238.04] P:1446.48 E:0.308136 |  They're quite happy to drop into a five when England have possession.
[238.04 - 240.04] P:1472.72 E:0.267595 |  It's a five three two.
[240.04 - 244.92] P:1714.29 E:0.298293 |  And when teams line up against you like that, it's really important you get that ball switched
[244.92 - 247.64] P:1521.81 E:0.294892 |  nice and quickly into our wide areas.
[247.64 - 254.52] P:1514.23 E:0.275521 |  Move the ball from side to side quickly and make the midfield three that are going to slide across.
[254.52 - 256.60] P:1727.70 E:0.297190 |  Do extra work trying to get there.
[256.60 - 261.48] P:1537.77 E:0.280803 |  If you do it slowly, the whole team shuttle across and plays too predictable.
[262.36 - 266.12] P:1543.74 E:0.276473 |  That is an area that England haven't always excelled in.
[266.12 - 269.72] P:1493.03 E:0.240794 |  Even within this tournament where progress has been
[272.12 - 275.08] P:1733.71 E:0.211116 |  serene at times, but still confident.
[275.08 - 277.40] P:1843.99 E:0.281668 |  Shaw playing it in. It's cut out in the midfield.
[279.24 - 282.44] P:1577.29 E:0.262725 |  But straight back to England again where McRae will pick it up on halfway.
[282.44 - 284.44] P:1752.77 E:0.290012 |  Lay spread towards John Stone.
[284.44 - 285.80] P:1742.06 E:0.262507 |  Stone's playing it out to
[286.60 - 288.20] P:1341.59 E:0.215424 |  can't walk around the England right back.
[288.20 - 290.84] P:1765.54 E:0.277128 |  He goes through the midfield again towards Calvin Phillips.
[291.48 - 293.48] P:1479.14 E:0.269194 |  England looking up surveying their options.
[293.48 - 296.36] P:1558.84 E:0.293737 |  Harry Kane beating out towards the left hand side of the penalty area.
[296.36 - 299.72] P:1754.47 E:0.274590 |  Sterling at the moment in a central position around the edge of the D.
[300.52 - 304.04] P:1332.29 E:0.226336 |  Sanjo making a dancing run out to the
[304.92 - 305.88] P:1684.27 E:0.294963 |  right hand touch line.
[305.88 - 310.04] P:1512.48 E:0.272273 |  The ball being worked back inside the centre circle again.
[310.92 - 313.16] P:1657.42 E:0.301674 |  That England just getting an early feel of the ball.
[313.16 - 314.92] P:1621.82 E:0.267544 |  Laying it out towards Kane on the left leg.
[314.92 - 317.64] P:1603.88 E:0.267025 |  Now the long quick accurate switch of play.
[318.20 - 319.16] P:1647.37 E:0.255961 |  Good to see.
[319.16 - 320.84] P:1672.52 E:0.264451 |  Out towards Karl Walker.
[320.84 - 323.08] P:1687.08 E:0.276515 |  Walker plays forward into the feet of Jaden Sanjo.
[323.08 - 325.40] P:1825.22 E:0.310716 |  An opportunity to turn inside the penalty area.
[325.40 - 328.84] P:1859.51 E:0.279708 |  The challenge comes in as a fair one despite the appeals that
[329.56 - 331.16] P:1742.24 E:0.300362 |  perhaps the referee should have a look at it.
[331.16 - 333.48] P:1528.33 E:0.242378 |  Mason Mount was the player that went down but
[333.48 - 335.88] P:1599.59 E:0.261903 |  they will go on and it's back with Calvin Phillips again
[336.44 - 337.96] P:1654.96 E:0.273221 |  in the heart of the England midfield.
[338.52 - 340.60] P:1503.67 E:0.199774 |  From him to McGuire.
[340.60 - 342.04] P:1717.50 E:0.277907 |  Down towards Raheem Sterling.
[342.84 - 345.00] P:1430.86 E:0.259992 |  Three and a half gone on talk sport at Nill Nill.
[345.00 - 347.56] P:1717.14 E:0.293067 |  Sterling trying to ride the challenge slips it in.
[347.56 - 348.68] P:1915.46 E:0.262340 |  It's Harry Kane.
[348.68 - 351.40] P:1868.39 E:0.256770 |  It is the perfect start for England.
[353.72 - 356.52] P:1696.89 E:0.287115 |  Listen to that roar around Rome.
[356.52 - 358.04] P:1692.26 E:0.270359 |  Three and a half minutes gone.
[359.08 - 360.44] P:1816.37 E:0.302084 |  And it's Ukraine Nill.
[361.16 - 366.20] P:1614.35 E:0.284343 |  England won one perceptive through ball inside the penalty area.
[366.20 - 368.44] P:1748.08 E:0.276500 |  Harry Kane has finished it.
[368.44 - 370.20] P:1756.90 E:0.295183 |  He got the Ronald Karabayev.
[371.56 - 375.56] P:1679.32 E:0.281851 |  And his ability and sharpness in front of goal did the rest.
[376.20 - 377.48] P:1568.32 E:0.324796 |  A long way to go.
[378.28 - 383.88] P:1461.08 E:0.286843 |  That is the perfect start as England have their noses in front of you.
[384.52 - 387.48] P:1588.48 E:0.326766 |  Yeah the creator on this occasion Sterling.
[387.48 - 389.88] P:1274.17 E:0.303234 |  Fantastic little dart and ball through.
[390.52 - 394.28] P:1430.52 E:0.309374 |  And when Kane went through he just lifted it over the goalkeeper.
[394.28 - 397.08] P:1440.12 E:0.291528 |  Skimmed off his chest and into the back of the net.
[397.08 - 401.40] P:1461.32 E:0.300083 |  Ukraine have started to go in very tepid showing England a lot of respect.
[401.40 - 405.88] P:1518.22 E:0.298003 |  And I think the ball hit in the back of the net will only emphasize the point.
[405.88 - 408.20] P:1633.14 E:0.274897 |  You're probably going to have to show us respect tonight.
[408.60 - 415.08] P:1412.42 E:0.216283 |  Again fantastic with Sterling coming inside and showing that quality.
[416.92 - 418.44] P:1554.19 E:0.325080 |  Just keep them doing that really.
[418.44 - 420.28] P:1500.63 E:0.260128 |  That great movement from Harry as well.
[421.24 - 424.60] P:1840.08 E:0.248075 |  So Harry Kane with the goal those are the thoughts of Stuart Pierce.
[424.60 - 427.56] P:1532.53 E:0.186819 |  And Sol Campbell to four man.
[427.56 - 430.20] P:1604.04 E:0.249478 |  England World Cup defenders with us here on Torch Spore.
[430.92 - 436.68] P:1481.17 E:0.182816 |  Harry Kane's goal scored four minutes from the end against Germany.
[436.68 - 438.76] P:1912.53 E:0.290552 |  Four minutes from the start against Ukraine.
[439.88 - 442.60] P:1616.15 E:0.285425 |  His first two knockout goals for England.
[442.60 - 444.12] P:1766.22 E:0.285026 |  How sweet they are.
[444.12 - 446.12] P:1675.92 E:0.260272 |  Eight now for an amazing tournament.
[446.12 - 451.16] P:1521.04 E:0.226343 |  All told 31 in his last 39 starts for his country.
[453.88 - 455.72] P:1447.95 E:0.218796 |  And again without wishing to tempt fate.
[456.60 - 461.72] P:1466.47 E:0.240770 |  When you're one nil up and you're a side that haven't conceded a single goal in the tournament so far.
[462.84 - 466.28] P:1526.52 E:0.223115 |  What an early shot of confidence of adrenaline.
[466.28 - 467.96] P:1547.03 E:0.271246 |  That is going through the veins.
[470.28 - 473.32] P:1704.34 E:0.276870 |  And you can hear the England supporters dotted around in there.
[474.28 - 477.64] P:1818.50 E:0.282924 |  They're hundreds rather than tens of thousands around the stadium.
[477.64 - 482.68] P:1583.66 E:0.268035 |  But it is certainly the England support outnumbering the Ukrainian counterparts tonight.
[483.56 - 485.56] P:1504.51 E:0.201410 |  And it is they who are in voice.
[485.56 - 490.68] P:1602.05 E:0.226412 |  Already Ukraine trying to get the full backs for that little bit more readily.
[490.68 - 493.24] P:1798.33 E:0.259996 |  Opportunity for them to bring it towards the edge of the penalty area.
[493.24 - 495.48] P:1759.58 E:0.248396 |  Yama Lenko wanted the ball into feet.
[495.48 - 496.92] P:1733.03 E:0.215025 |  Was it forthcoming?
[496.92 - 498.60] P:1796.20 E:0.310470 |  And sure is there to head it away.
[499.40 - 502.84] P:1695.81 E:0.241961 |  Well Southgate will field it just that controls it.
[503.56 - 506.92] P:1690.88 E:0.271100 |  Staring on the edge of the technical area in his dark suits.
[508.52 - 513.24] P:1463.23 E:0.242748 |  And internally he will be bustling with pride at the start that England have made.
[514.04 - 516.68] P:1780.83 E:0.258740 |  Started three of the four games before tonight.
[516.68 - 518.92] P:1825.79 E:0.252455 |  Very sharply hit the post in the first three.
[519.72 - 522.84] P:1641.45 E:0.265442 |  And now have hit the net four minutes in in this one.
[523.32 - 527.00] P:1479.15 E:0.248037 |  Ukraine, then England won on talk sport ball out of play.
[527.00 - 530.12] P:1457.14 E:0.224113 |  Sol Campbell for a throw on the Ukrainian run.
[530.12 - 531.08] P:1103.36 E:0.168175 |  It's okay.
[531.08 - 533.16] P:1314.34 E:0.251143 |  You know they've conceded and now
[533.16 - 536.52] P:1239.31 E:0.236409 |  Ukraine have started quite high up confident on the ball.
[536.52 - 539.48] P:1157.59 E:0.239702 |  It's almost you want to say well why don't you start like that?
[540.60 - 541.32] P:1360.81 E:0.233275 |  Who cares though?
[541.32 - 542.92] P:1113.22 E:0.213769 |  One nil to England.
[543.48 - 544.44] P:1393.07 E:0.225545 |  Absolutely.
[544.44 - 547.80] P:1486.84 E:0.251453 |  There's Yama Lenko playing the ball down the right hand touch line.
[547.80 - 550.60] P:1500.54 E:0.245706 |  And it should be easy for Harry Maguire to get there first.
[550.60 - 552.04] P:1504.29 E:0.260218 |  Takes it down towards the corner flag.
[552.04 - 556.12] P:1555.99 E:0.225204 |  Gets it away down towards the figure of Raheem Sturk.
[556.12 - 557.32] P:2019.78 E:0.286922 |  It's just only a little kick out.
[557.32 - 560.44] P:1476.53 E:0.262615 |  He caught Karavayev there rather than being able to play the ball.
[561.24 - 565.32] P:1632.03 E:0.241911 |  And it's an opportunity for Ukraine to test England's ability on set pieces.
[566.36 - 570.76] P:1578.00 E:0.224498 |  It is an area where Ukraine themselves defensively can struggle.
[571.48 - 574.20] P:1521.97 E:0.216237 |  Much better with attacking set pieces than they are defending them.
[574.84 - 579.00] P:1587.11 E:0.250206 |  Two of the six goals that they've scored in this tournament so far have come from headers.
[579.88 - 582.04] P:1425.50 E:0.235980 |  Ball being swept inside the penalty area.
[583.88 - 586.36] P:1445.49 E:0.205077 |  Now Jordan Pickford hasn't had a touch of the ball as yet.
[586.36 - 589.96] P:1725.11 E:0.259917 |  Just reaches behind the goal for a white towel that is discarded there.
[589.96 - 590.92] P:1978.32 E:0.266685 |  Drives his face.
[591.80 - 594.20] P:1619.75 E:0.230234 |  Just takes a little bit of sweat off his brow.
[594.20 - 596.84] P:1851.26 E:0.263252 |  It's going to be a free kick which will be swept in by Shaporenko.
[597.40 - 600.20] P:1790.39 E:0.273092 |  A little bit of the bubbling around on the edge of the penalty area.
[600.20 - 603.00] P:1711.00 E:0.266048 |  And optimistic appeals for a hand ball by those in yellow.
[603.00 - 603.56] P:1662.78 E:0.265668 |  Nothing given.
[603.56 - 605.08] P:1903.55 E:0.273807 |  It's back for Shaporenko again.
[605.56 - 608.52] P:1620.49 E:0.216564 |  Shaporenko working it back for Matveyenko.
[609.40 - 611.32] P:1531.45 E:0.213009 |  And now played forward through the midfield forward.
[611.32 - 612.04] P:2066.12 E:0.314991 |  So Sid Orchard.
[612.04 - 617.72] P:1499.86 E:0.206185 |  Can England be able to push out and just get Ukraine playing that a little bit higher?
[617.72 - 623.72] P:1533.82 E:0.234726 |  Interesting actually that the three Ukrainian center halves aren't playing the way around that we
[623.72 - 624.44] P:1624.21 E:0.277065 |  anticipated.
[624.44 - 630.52] P:1494.76 E:0.237221 |  They've got Matveyenko who possibly is the weak link playing on the right of the three
[630.52 - 631.40] P:1472.28 E:0.265665 |  rather than the left.
[631.40 - 636.84] P:1452.07 E:0.195320 |  The young Zabani giving that little bit more license to push forward on the left of the
[636.84 - 638.28] P:1530.84 E:0.222694 |  three center halves.
[638.28 - 641.00] P:1810.60 E:0.272293 |  Zinchenko's got the ball on the edge of the center circle.
[641.00 - 643.48] P:1628.46 E:0.276781 |  And it turns neatly and plays it back for Sid Orchard.
[643.48 - 646.04] P:1680.41 E:0.286201 |  Down from him to the dark head Shaporenko.
[646.04 - 650.68] P:1712.03 E:0.253581 |  Caravaya pushing forward from right wing back plays the ball towards the edge of the penalty
[650.68 - 651.08] P:1690.87 E:0.339125 |  area.
[651.08 - 654.60] P:1604.24 E:0.243493 |  Calvin Phillips can stick out a foot and knock it away easily.
[655.80 - 658.20] P:1757.70 E:0.280485 |  Since England took the lead with that early Harry Kane goal.
[659.16 - 663.24] P:1578.51 E:0.244646 |  Ukraine have had more of the possession hardly had a kick of the ball prior to England taking
[663.24 - 664.36] P:1527.94 E:0.216889 |  the lead on four minutes.
[665.16 - 668.52] P:1500.77 E:0.177233 |  Now more possession easier possession.
[668.52 - 671.00] P:1319.84 E:0.220525 |  Now they're working back towards the edge of their own penalty area.
[671.00 - 672.60] P:1665.28 E:0.296686 |  We're nine minutes in here in Rome.
[672.60 - 673.80] P:1729.65 E:0.229079 |  Is Ukraine ill?
[673.80 - 674.44] P:1419.11 E:0.234519 |  England won.
[674.44 - 675.24] P:1735.67 E:0.179766 |  Here's Stu appears.
[675.96 - 682.04] P:1555.59 E:0.262257 |  What I like about England's performance is Jim we seem to be seamlessly picking up good form
[682.04 - 683.96] P:1663.77 E:0.234566 |  from one game to another.
[683.96 - 688.04] P:1754.27 E:0.270568 |  You know we finish a game on good form with good confidence and straight away we
[688.12 - 692.60] P:1662.94 E:0.272232 |  run into the next game looking as though we're playing exactly the same way with
[692.60 - 698.12] P:1512.69 E:0.255914 |  no nerves with our performance, good passing, good understanding of positional play.
[698.12 - 700.76] P:1343.58 E:0.257301 |  And well we couldn't have got a better start in this one.
[702.20 - 705.16] P:1622.26 E:0.219637 |  England have one of the last four meetings between these two.
[705.16 - 706.36] P:1823.16 E:0.290841 |  That was in the Euros as well.
[707.40 - 711.48] P:1722.50 E:0.301046 |  Nine years ago Wayne Rooney scoring early in the second half in a game in the Dnyaks.
[712.20 - 715.32] P:1630.55 E:0.245254 |  England finished top of the group and Ukraine at finish bottom.
[716.28 - 721.40] P:1709.13 E:0.271978 |  Here's Luke Shaw in possession for England now leading courtesy of that Harry Kane goal
[722.76 - 724.68] P:1713.13 E:0.216694 |  which is his 36th goal for his country.
[725.32 - 730.76] P:1485.17 E:0.269490 |  Jim one thing I'm looking at here I think if the Ukrainians lose the ball and drop back
[730.76 - 734.52] P:1570.85 E:0.265219 |  into shape the one thing we can do is dictate the tempo of this game.
[734.52 - 739.32] P:1553.14 E:0.257259 |  I don't think they press particularly well from the front so we can dictate the tempo.
[739.32 - 744.52] P:1591.47 E:0.293475 |  The only time they'll get a touch at a ball potentially is when we gamble on it to attempt
[744.52 - 749.00] P:1578.33 E:0.272069 |  to go forward but that's the good thing we can take the sting out of the game at any given time
[749.00 - 755.08] P:1551.51 E:0.203206 |  that we want to. Sterling winning a throw laying it back for McGuire now the stones
[755.08 - 758.92] P:1655.85 E:0.268098 |  played forward through the midfield to Declan Rice who benches into Ukrainian territory.
[760.52 - 764.36] P:1385.51 E:0.259869 |  Ladies little one to a car walk against it back and then works it down to the
[765.08 - 768.76] P:1473.03 E:0.281233 |  left hand side of the back line for Harry McGuire and on towards Luke Shaw.
[769.80 - 771.32] P:1760.63 E:0.266704 |  Shaw's got Mason Mounties ahead of him.
[771.32 - 776.60] P:1662.88 E:0.264085 |  Calvin Phillips making a good run which has split the lines but the pass wasn't forthcoming
[776.60 - 782.76] P:1597.11 E:0.234236 |  it's worked back instead for Shaw into his own half from McGuire and back behind square from him to
[782.76 - 790.76] P:1210.85 E:0.181066 |  John Stones. Now it comes down towards McGuire again England with a man over on the right hand
[790.76 - 798.60] P:1405.24 E:0.223872 |  side the the ball out towards Karl Walker always on and McGuire plays it almost that far towards
[798.60 - 804.44] P:1463.41 E:0.226952 |  Declan Rice now it does come down towards Walker but Ukraine defending with a back five when they
[804.44 - 810.28] P:1298.64 E:0.201012 |  haven't got possession still defending quite narrow. Look as though they're susceptible to the quick
[810.28 - 814.04] P:1812.88 E:0.297220 |  switcher play Ukraine have turned possession over here Yama Lenko making a good run forwards
[814.04 - 819.24] P:1820.71 E:0.282648 |  Yeremchuk that's got the ball tall dark-edged striker working right for Yama Lenko who will want
[819.24 - 823.72] P:1834.98 E:0.259421 |  to cut into onto his left foot low ball into wants the near post Rice has come back and
[824.44 - 827.64] P:1921.45 E:0.288722 |  fields across from his club team they turn knock it away and it came
[828.60 - 833.56] P:1642.37 E:0.217144 |  almost won the seconds as it just looked as though they overplayed it in the midfield Ukraine
[833.56 - 838.04] P:1620.01 E:0.235705 |  but Sabali has it and has played it back for Matt Vienko he said the halves just switching
[838.04 - 843.32] P:1670.75 E:0.271638 |  around to their more customary format now for Ukraine and the ball played out towards the left
[843.32 - 848.36] P:1525.60 E:0.231139 |  hand touch line was over hit goes out it's an England throw which will be taken inside their
[848.36 - 852.28] P:1502.67 E:0.256185 |  own half in the right back position with 12 minutes in on Torch Sport it's Ukraine now
[852.28 - 857.08] P:1519.72 E:0.258168 |  England one of these are the thoughts of Sol Campbell I feel now with Ukraine I don't think
[857.08 - 863.48] P:1378.02 E:0.209901 |  they've got any energy but when they obviously you know get that kind of turnover you can see how
[863.48 - 869.08] P:1422.64 E:0.245686 |  quickly they can attack but for me England I've got them because they just seem dead on their feet
[871.40 - 879.08] P:1282.25 E:0.196312 |  got through 120 minutes of the game in Glasgow against Sweden which they won with a goal in the
[879.08 - 886.52] P:1423.28 E:0.203651 |  121st minute it was the second latest goal in Euro's history young striker Goldberg coming off
[886.52 - 892.36] P:1483.65 E:0.219466 |  the bench and doing the damage against the Sweden side that have played just a little over half an
[892.36 - 900.92] P:1305.79 E:0.196724 |  hour of that match with 10 men certainly felt as an England fan that England would have more chance
[900.92 - 905.88] P:1602.38 E:0.287182 |  in this game if it were against Ukraine rather than against Sweden have the opportunity to make
[905.88 - 911.32] P:1772.92 E:0.282980 |  their way forward now with Walker getting towards the byline tries to deliver across which is well
[911.32 - 916.44] P:1683.73 E:0.266280 |  defended by the retreating Mikolenko but it goes out of play for a throw that England will take down
[916.44 - 922.36] P:1484.59 E:0.256485 |  by the corner flag over on the far touch line that's 13 minutes gone and it's one meal to England on a
[923.24 - 928.68] P:1430.62 E:0.254854 |  day where so far possession has been over the whole piece 50-50 although England dominated
[928.68 - 934.12] P:1563.09 E:0.262612 |  the early exchanges and Ukraine have had a little bit more of it since the goal went in Luke Shaw
[934.12 - 940.04] P:1532.70 E:0.259246 |  has possession on the England left Ukraine have only ever beaten England once which was in qualified
[940.04 - 945.64] P:1480.91 E:0.289256 |  for the 2010 World Cup a one-nil success and Rob Green set off very early in that game you know
[945.64 - 952.60] P:1355.60 E:0.220486 |  though Ukraine missed the penalty they still ended up winning one-nil. Shachenko played that day but
[952.60 - 959.56] P:1471.32 E:0.236972 |  the first ever match with Ukraine was the England's last ever victory at the old Wembley. Gower Southgate
[959.56 - 965.96] P:1380.29 E:0.232685 |  played that day and so did a Mr. Sol Campbell also playing in what turned out to be England's last
[965.96 - 972.36] P:1739.32 E:0.246863 |  ever win under the Twin Towers. I'm going to get back under the arch for two games over the next
[972.36 - 978.60] P:1606.58 E:0.224283 |  eight days that the main prize and 14 minutes in so far so good as far as England are concerned
[978.60 - 986.04] P:1413.63 E:0.197134 |  still got easy possession inside Ukrainian territory all over on the right hand side for England
[986.04 - 991.56] P:1553.55 E:0.245423 |  good combinations between Walker and Jadon Sanjo who's already played twice as long in this game
[991.56 - 997.72] P:1331.54 E:0.231284 |  as he has in the rest of the tournament combined. Rice now playing it back for Harry Maguire Luke
[997.72 - 1002.36] P:1617.75 E:0.273807 |  Shaw on the left down towards Shaw a couple of yards in from the left hand touch line just
[1002.36 - 1009.40] P:1803.97 E:0.254049 |  forced back by Karavayev lays it back for Maguire and it's just simple possession as far as England
[1010.20 - 1017.40] P:1720.13 E:0.237097 |  not at a great tempo now it's given away one back by Matt Vienko Matt Vienko getting it looking to
[1017.40 - 1023.64] P:1706.80 E:0.244118 |  launch it long Yarmolenko had made a run into the inside left channel and the ball had been played
[1023.64 - 1029.32] P:1591.29 E:0.255810 |  to where he had been a couple of seconds previously it sailed just behind him and over his shoulder
[1029.32 - 1034.44] P:1506.07 E:0.253435 |  and goes out for well down towards the left hand side for England who can build from the back again
[1034.44 - 1038.04] P:1575.81 E:0.299488 |  it's Walker playing it down towards Sanjo good movement off the ball that time came from Mason
[1038.04 - 1043.00] P:1515.70 E:0.252881 |  Matt's gone out of play Stuart for an England throw with the three lines leading one now yeah
[1043.00 - 1048.44] P:1553.33 E:0.268144 |  it's crucial that England with the Ukrainians playing so deep and compact and we've sort of
[1048.44 - 1054.44] P:1536.66 E:0.256576 |  a narrow head if you like up to their two forwards that we play on the outside of them don't try and
[1054.44 - 1060.04] P:1715.49 E:0.275733 |  go through them certainly unless you're in the last third in their last third by all means try and
[1060.04 - 1065.32] P:1530.65 E:0.255345 |  Fred Little passes through don't give the ball away in the mid third though because they come alive
[1065.32 - 1071.56] P:1551.48 E:0.260947 |  Yarmolenko's look to go in behind on a couple of occasions your amchuk could do the same as well
[1071.56 - 1077.72] P:1594.41 E:0.260820 |  so no give away possession keep bodies behind the ball when we have to and only gamble the ball in
[1077.72 - 1082.60] P:1585.02 E:0.252241 |  the final third because when you've got your nose in front in these games you don't have to chance
[1082.60 - 1087.48] P:1499.89 E:0.263402 |  that ball because if they do turn it over as they've shown before they'll look to go in behind you
[1087.48 - 1092.92] P:1684.78 E:0.209487 |  as quick as they possibly can Yarmolenko just lost the house winning his 99th cup for the
[1092.92 - 1098.76] P:1659.20 E:0.238325 |  Ukrainians and I was good speaking before the game about the the immense patriotism that he has
[1098.76 - 1105.72] P:1426.21 E:0.192567 |  playing for his country it's just lost possession there Luke Shaw's got it on the left hand side
[1105.72 - 1112.12] P:1476.30 E:0.199477 |  just a yard in from the left hand touch line now that goal that Harry Kane scored incidentally
[1112.12 - 1117.96] P:1806.08 E:0.261586 |  England's earliest goal in the European Championship match is 2004. Pickford having to get down at his
[1117.96 - 1123.64] P:1828.61 E:0.250026 |  near post able to make a save from Yarmolenko just for a moment looked as though he's going to get
[1123.64 - 1130.04] P:1611.40 E:0.225674 |  in behind the England back line. The good goal scoring record it was an under hit back pass Walker
[1130.04 - 1135.32] P:1547.84 E:0.235386 |  looking to lay it back towards Harry McGuire didn't have the legs to get there and Yarmolenko with a
[1135.32 - 1141.24] P:1579.52 E:0.221113 |  tame ish shot in the end which Pickford was able to beat round the post and out of play for a corner
[1141.24 - 1147.32] P:1719.25 E:0.296800 |  as I was just saying do not gamble and give the ball away in central areas there's no need for it
[1148.28 - 1152.76] P:1730.51 E:0.244058 |  in comes the corner Ukraine's first of the game headed away England win the seconds as well try
[1152.76 - 1160.04] P:1562.82 E:0.183551 |  and divert it further clear but many yellow have won it back Karavayev just played by Matvienko
[1160.84 - 1167.64] P:1554.29 E:0.173950 |  through the midfield to the left hand touch line Mika Lenko making his way forward from left back
[1167.64 - 1172.60] P:1435.20 E:0.200360 |  and it goes back for Matvienko again certainly sent a heart but looking at the goals Ukraine
[1172.60 - 1177.16] P:1589.59 E:0.234466 |  have conceded in this game it looks as though you can not just run at him but you can probably run
[1177.16 - 1182.92] P:1357.09 E:0.180094 |  off him as well England haven't had the opportunity to to do that so far with the way that the
[1182.92 - 1189.00] P:1438.60 E:0.200547 |  players been condensed but Ukraine beginning to spread about a bit making grab towards the left
[1189.00 - 1193.56] P:1769.86 E:0.264841 |  hand side of the penalty area towards Yarmolenko who tried an optimistic little back heel flick
[1193.56 - 1197.96] P:1717.40 E:0.241422 |  around the edge of the box it's knocked away by Declan Rice and Ukraine will pick it up back
[1197.96 - 1203.24] P:1436.89 E:0.234704 |  inside the road 18 minutes gone Ukraine nil England won and a level here from sure appears
[1203.24 - 1207.96] P:1338.59 E:0.189352 |  a firstly soul Campbell it's concentration level as well you know you don't when you got so much
[1207.96 - 1212.44] P:1499.41 E:0.222671 |  possession you don't want to lose it and they don't want to lose your concentration make sure
[1212.44 - 1216.52] P:1401.20 E:0.229814 |  every pass is proper don't lose the ball concentrate 100 percent
[1219.08 - 1223.64] P:1544.09 E:0.258197 |  there's bases on the outside here tonight against these when they're out of possession they drop
[1223.64 - 1230.04] P:1374.18 E:0.211279 |  into that little pointed press deep lying we can dictate the tempo of when we play
[1230.76 - 1233.88] P:1466.85 E:0.275342 |  put the spaces on the outside of them and that's what we've got to utilize
[1234.60 - 1239.00] P:1614.32 E:0.267285 |  well when we finish here at the Stalio Olympic going Rome at 11 o'clock tonight Adam Cantor
[1239.00 - 1244.36] P:1494.32 E:0.237056 |  all and Mickey Gray will be taking your calls on national radio 717 double two double three
[1244.36 - 1247.88] P:1499.89 E:0.265733 |  double four is the number you get your calls then have you say on talk sport from 11 tonight and
[1247.88 - 1252.76] P:1689.00 E:0.261041 |  then tomorrow morning on the weekend sports breakfast is Natalie Sawyer and Tony Cascarino
[1253.64 - 1258.12] P:1480.24 E:0.220642 |  Ukraine had a play down an injury at the moment and it would be put out of play by
[1258.76 - 1266.28] P:1406.88 E:0.175754 |  Shapa Reinko just so they can attend to Caravane and see how significant his problem is he's
[1266.28 - 1270.44] P:1557.81 E:0.268544 |  just down on the it's Matt the Encore beg your pardon just down on the left hand side of the

[2169.00 - 2173.88] P:1834.27 E:0.270048 |  and it's going to be sehan kov who's going to come on so this could well be a change in shape
[2174.44 - 2179.88] P:1456.37 E:0.226338 |  because they're taking a center half on and they're bringing a winger on so whether they've
[2179.88 - 2185.88] P:1759.01 E:0.258846 |  already electing that maybe they need to change the shape they could play alternatively sehan kov
[2185.88 - 2192.04] P:1666.78 E:0.230756 |  over as a left wing back and jopnikolenko back in as one of center one of the center halves so

[2451.96 - 2457.48] P:1639.45 E:0.273574 |  have been sledgehammering at the goal and i think luke shore picked the the more difficult pass in
[2457.48 - 2463.48] P:1740.78 E:0.263628 |  some ways sancho still had a player to beat and his ability to turn and get a shot away was commendable
[2463.48 - 2468.60] P:1453.05 E:0.220311 |  but i think sure should have had to take in the shot and see what come of it you only go about 50

[3379.72 - 3388.04] P:1629.76 E:0.273347 |  yeah it's gone well so far three goals in the space of 54 minutes for harry kane

[3404.76 - 3411.08] P:1500.23 E:0.298426 |  so i think the more this game goes on the gym the more the importance of your utilisation of

[3460.84 - 3466.04] P:1652.47 E:0.281591 |  harry mcguire this one just arcing it 50 yards up into the nice sky and it will bounce down on
[3466.04 - 3471.72] P:1439.01 E:0.271268 |  halfway and out of play for a throw and we were talking about how england could win this game
[3471.72 - 3476.52] P:1574.27 E:0.279642 |  sold before its starting you were talking about deliveries into the kill zone and we've seen it
[3476.52 - 3481.08] P:1252.74 E:0.301165 |  and that's it that's what you've got to do give whoever's in there a chance to kind of put the
[3481.08 - 3487.00] P:1277.99 E:0.290609 |  ball away either by you know good cross or bullet header so they've done really well i think england
[3487.00 - 3495.00] P:1304.10 E:0.280799 |  has been fantastic keep holding the ball give it under the ball and when it's the right moment great cross

[3509.24 - 3514.60] P:1548.34 E:0.279946 |  and saying you know what whatever happens we don't concede a goal now if we go and get four and five
[3514.60 - 3519.96] P:1636.18 E:0.236672 |  so be it but we don't concede a goal what's the psychological advantage if england could go into
[3519.96 - 3525.80] P:1525.54 E:0.259662 |  a semi-final having not conceded a single goal in the tournament up to that point and what an
[3525.80 - 3531.16] P:1649.24 E:0.287909 |  edge that could give them they have possession now inside their own half they've got the healthiest

[3553.40 - 3557.56] P:1784.10 E:0.276608 |  situation that they can get rice and philips off the field because i'm sure to be those two that

[3906.28 - 3913.16] P:1616.22 E:0.277549 |  that in match situations like this where you're saving some players you're saving legs and also as
