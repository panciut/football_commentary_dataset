[110.04 - 115.52] P:1637.09 E:0.087240 |  Yeah, they'll be very fluid and they've started off with Havertz as the central striker
[116.40 - 122.00] P:1668.67 E:0.096208 |  Well, that wasn't dealt with at all across from the left-hand side Muller with his back to goal played it a long way back to

[155.40 - 159.88] P:1687.43 E:0.085523 |  With that was Schlotterbeck now in there then Kimmich playing in the midfield comes over and takes over

[165.04 - 170.04] P:1687.17 E:0.097691 |  Gündo and in those deeper lying rolls will see Ram on that left-hand side the left back
[170.60 - 173.96] P:1608.82 E:0.082714 |  Better going forward. I think it's fair to say than defensively
[173.96 - 180.28] P:1618.83 E:0.087879 |  But up top Havertz is the central striker Muller just in behind him with Musiala off that left-hand side and

[206.60 - 211.00] P:1663.44 E:0.097662 |  It's Maida tries to get around the back of Rudiger. That was a good old foot chase there for
[212.12 - 218.76] P:1751.06 E:0.091607 |  Celtic forward against the former Chelsea defender Rudiger. Yeah, he's that's his strength days of Maida
[219.32 - 225.24] P:1694.83 E:0.068513 |  His pace he'll make those runs in behind his hold-up play isn't the cleanest but
[226.40 - 231.32] P:1501.99 E:0.083079 |  Japan have got some players and really talented players in the middle of the park who look to get on the half turn

[308.68 - 311.96] P:1516.47 E:0.088983 |  But episode five if you wish to to rewind
[312.52 - 316.20] P:1565.87 E:0.081896 |  That's going to cause great debates in light of
[318.68 - 322.20] P:1738.76 E:0.101030 |  Saudi Arabia's victory against Argentina yesterday because

[334.36 - 336.36] P:1516.36 E:0.086096 |  I think much happened was the age of two then
[337.16 - 339.16] P:1649.48 E:0.075705 |  but certainly
[339.24 - 341.24] P:1634.56 E:0.093751 |  Argentina against Saudi Arabia
[341.48 - 346.68] P:1651.27 E:0.084768 |  Will be added to that list, but if you want to find episode five then BBC sounds
[347.40 - 349.48] P:1786.67 E:0.090095 |  There is so much World Cup
[352.28 - 353.40] P:1675.92 E:0.088282 |  material

[360.12 - 366.20] P:1641.80 E:0.087420 |  But six minutes played here so far nil nil and it's been a slow start chris. Yes, I was tentative
[366.76 - 368.76] P:1552.66 E:0.054066 |  uh from Germany
[368.76 - 371.72] P:1721.45 E:0.076801 |  Japan just easing the way into this game. They've
[372.28 - 374.28] P:1393.11 E:0.084795 |  set up with with a back four and
[375.08 - 375.96] P:1556.48 E:0.018594 |  then
[375.96 - 377.32] P:1591.07 E:0.048372 |  What's your row?
[377.32 - 381.40] P:1709.36 E:0.080649 |  Endo just sitting in front of that back four. He'll be the enforcer
[382.12 - 387.16] P:1752.18 E:0.070631 |  In there getting the screens on and stopping those balls into the likes of havert
[387.72 - 389.40] P:1802.04 E:0.061484 |  Up top for Germany
[389.40 - 394.44] P:1792.60 E:0.096636 |  He was a doubt coming into the game with toro and oh defensive midfielder for stuttgart
[396.20 - 397.96] P:1894.21 E:0.050323 |  He's uh
[397.96 - 402.52] P:1549.25 E:0.094006 |  Certainly a player who they were able to get off. There was another doubt over mitoma of brighton and hobalby
[403.16 - 408.52] P:1641.46 E:0.081671 |  Endo recovered from from concussion, but mitoma had a little bit of illness. He is on the bench
[409.24 - 414.36] P:1733.83 E:0.095585 |  The the brighton player who's certainly impressed in the early stages of his career at the the amex
[414.92 - 419.40] P:1733.76 E:0.094833 |  As for arsenals tomoyasu rested against canada last week with a calf problem
[420.28 - 424.84] P:1792.22 E:0.083008 |  Not fit enough to start nagatomo clears away for japan. He hoists that high
[425.88 - 428.76] P:1779.88 E:0.068760 |  And it drops towards kimik to gun do an
[430.76 - 432.76] P:1787.04 E:0.079755 |  Central area of the japan half
[432.84 - 436.12] P:1671.84 E:0.107741 |  Dispossessed though there by kamada who now runs forward
[436.52 - 440.92] P:1692.37 E:0.111346 |  He's got ito away to his right hand side here is ito plays it in my
[442.20 - 444.20] P:1638.88 E:0.095043 |  Flags of a foresight
[444.36 - 449.80] P:1762.25 E:0.109842 |  And the japan celebrations are cut short very very quickly from that flag that was raised on the right
[450.28 - 454.20] P:1662.53 E:0.106452 |  It was an excellent break by japan. Of course it will go to v.a.r
[455.48 - 457.48] P:1740.43 E:0.083164 |  He was offside
[457.72 - 459.72] P:1631.48 E:0.088451 |  It wasn't a great run from
[460.04 - 461.32] P:1668.09 E:0.056433 |  made up
[461.32 - 464.52] P:1751.10 E:0.104679 |  Of course because he was offside, but there's a warning for germany
[464.92 - 470.12] P:1695.30 E:0.093138 |  Kamada stealing the ball off gun do an and just popping the ball out right to or well offside ito
[470.20 - 473.48] P:1715.02 E:0.092043 |  But it there's no reason for him to be offside in that position
[474.12 - 476.12] P:1790.94 E:0.075123 |  He and he just gets beyond
[476.92 - 479.72] P:1714.06 E:0.100939 |  Rudiger as the cross comes in. It's a brilliant cross, but
[480.76 - 485.64] P:1699.43 E:0.094574 |  Made us looking across the line there needed to time his run better. It's good finish
[486.52 - 487.88] P:1573.13 E:0.046058 |  from him
[487.88 - 489.88] P:1594.99 E:0.058526 |  That's a warning
[489.88 - 494.04] P:1651.02 E:0.090131 |  To this german team. This is the way japan are going to try and do it this afternoon
[495.00 - 499.48] P:1641.80 E:0.093641 |  They'll be difficult to play through they'll sit a little bit deep at times and then they'll look to counter
[500.44 - 501.56] P:1723.33 E:0.044749 |  At pace
[501.56 - 506.84] P:1690.43 E:0.083008 |  Well, we said before didn't we when we were talking about the game in the build-up with mark Chapman that this german defense
[506.84 - 509.96] P:1672.88 E:0.077224 |  You can get at it and that was a prime example
[510.36 - 515.24] P:1709.30 E:0.086468 |  It was gun do an dispossessed in the midfield kimada carry the ball forward out towards the right
[515.64 - 518.60] P:1727.07 E:0.064318 |  And as christson says if tyson made it
[519.24 - 521.24] P:1869.58 E:0.074484 |  Just times that run better
[521.32 - 523.32] P:1925.61 E:0.073841 |  he would have had a
[523.32 - 529.24] P:1707.24 E:0.083035 |  Real opportunity for the goal ends with i mean he put it away well, but he was a good yard offside and you know he's
[530.12 - 534.28] P:1564.34 E:0.099055 |  He's behind rudiger the balls on the right hand side rudiger the right center half
[534.28 - 538.28] P:1670.26 E:0.064629 |  He's behind him and should look across the line and time his run
[539.00 - 540.44] P:1715.33 E:0.052724 |  Much much better
[540.44 - 547.56] P:1807.15 E:0.079859 |  But the issue germany have is because ram the left back gets plays so high up the pitch. There's a huge space on that
[548.44 - 550.44] P:1641.74 E:0.068396 |  right hand channel for japan
[550.68 - 553.72] P:1888.77 E:0.077767 |  gun do an chips the ball out towards that far side
[553.88 - 559.00] P:1812.25 E:0.087207 |  The toe was back to challenge round in the air out of play it goes for a germany throw
[560.12 - 564.76] P:1666.42 E:0.084395 |  It's interesting when that drum stops beating and we said about feast or famine with the atmospheres
[565.40 - 571.16] P:1622.16 E:0.091847 |  Bearing in mind that there doesn't appear to be too many empty seats in a ground that holds over 45 000 people
[571.80 - 573.80] P:1553.88 E:0.073259 |  Very very quiet
[573.80 - 581.40] P:1632.11 E:0.048168 |  As it's just been proven there when that drum stops for the stadium with the exception of the
[581.88 - 586.60] P:1810.69 E:0.081081 |  Top tier over on the far side that is still bathed in the late afternoon sunshine
[588.04 - 593.64] P:1623.65 E:0.089106 |  Felt very very hot today in doha around 28 degrees, but certainly inside the stadium very very cool
[594.36 - 598.44] P:1800.08 E:0.062721 |  The air conditioning working extremely well the cool the pitch
[598.92 - 600.36] P:1868.60 E:0.073470 |  certainly around
[600.36 - 604.28] P:1850.44 E:0.086430 |  21 degrees and it certainly will never go above 27 inside the stadium
[604.28 - 607.00] P:1721.03 E:0.074072 |  So that will never be a problem in any of the
[607.48 - 614.36] P:1764.07 E:0.082142 |  H stadiums that are being used this of course was the one that existed before kata won the the right to host the

[616.36 - 619.48] P:1730.75 E:0.074688 |  Remember coming here with england against brazil and a friendly in
[620.28 - 626.68] P:1728.82 E:0.086121 |  2009 although it has had a little bit of redevelopment work since then but it's nil nil you're listening to five live also available on bbc
[626.76 - 629.96] P:1842.99 E:0.076485 |  Sounds as the ball is picked up in the in the midfield
[630.36 - 636.84] P:1669.89 E:0.082570 |  For musciala in a in a central area and because he comes central it creates a little bit of space for around the left back
[637.24 - 641.56] P:1864.77 E:0.086216 |  To venture forward and he's quite high over on that far side the germany left
[641.72 - 646.04] P:1607.90 E:0.055892 |  He's playing like a left winger, isn't he not playing like a left back
[647.16 - 650.12] P:1682.06 E:0.076720 |  So high up, but that's the space the germans leave
[651.16 - 654.20] P:1681.06 E:0.056906 |  On the counter schlotter beck just stepping in there
[655.08 - 661.64] P:1548.15 E:0.074089 |  Blond hair defender into round good one waits for the run of round ahead of him hangs onto the ball now finds the left back
[662.12 - 666.44] P:1742.01 E:0.086729 |  That the challenge is is quick to to come in on that far side and
[667.08 - 671.88] P:1742.78 E:0.102128 |  Japan deal with it. Well, it was tenaka who was helping out on that far side itos forward ball

[846.68 - 848.68] P:1780.06 E:0.064839 |  I mean they're not hurting
[849.08 - 857.40] P:1763.20 E:0.081839 |  Japan at this moment in time everything is in front of the back four japan really well organized as we expected looking to pounce and counter
[858.28 - 865.80] P:1738.86 E:0.075135 |  Interesting cool. Sula at right back from hansy flicky that has played there predominantly for uh, dauntman this season, but

[874.44 - 876.44] P:1589.08 E:0.082760 |  Kara had the option of playing kara westhams
[877.72 - 878.84] P:1869.72 E:0.070110 |  Kara
[878.84 - 880.84] P:1763.24 E:0.072694 |  in that right back position
[881.24 - 886.36] P:1463.93 E:0.085669 |  But we're i think we were told when we before the game. He's one of the tenth quickest players in the bunders league
[886.60 - 889.88] P:1689.58 E:0.086204 |  Yeah, sloth again going. Yeah a little bit like me
[892.60 - 897.48] P:1707.30 E:0.070700 |  You mentioned kara kara actually played i know you dismissed the the warm-up game against oman last week
[897.48 - 900.28] P:1628.73 E:0.076874 |  But kara did play as the uh, the right back in that game
[900.52 - 907.64] P:1607.63 E:0.068697 |  And you think that that was a huge advantage and for the Germans going into this tournament playing a friendly against oman who were
[909.16 - 911.16] P:1744.08 E:0.050244 |  ranked 75th
[911.40 - 914.84] P:1563.88 E:0.079943 |  Not quite sure they were my words, but i'm not going to argue with you
[915.24 - 920.04] P:1274.30 E:0.080359 |  Yeah, i'd like to play that back. I think we can go if you've gone bbc sounds. I think we could play that back very good
[920.52 - 925.48] P:1585.48 E:0.088099 |  The manager will be pleased with that one. That's an unusual trail for bbc sounds take the world cup with you. Yeah
[925.64 - 927.64] P:1740.04 E:0.009737 |  Yeah
[927.96 - 931.32] P:1682.14 E:0.050430 |  Yeah, you can't forward wind but you can rewind
[933.32 - 939.80] P:1718.84 E:0.079933 |  Corner kick to germany 0-0 this is where they have a distinct height advantage, don't they the Germans
[941.32 - 943.48] P:1915.78 E:0.106268 |  15 minutes played corner kick to germany
[944.68 - 948.44] P:1780.56 E:0.099515 |  The japanese supporters with a beat of the drum our salvedorian referee
[948.52 - 953.48] P:1850.11 E:0.081839 |  Ivan Barton was just having a word there with a couple of players schlotterbeck was one of them
[953.80 - 955.80] P:1676.68 E:0.079914 |  I think he was up against their endo
[956.44 - 961.00] P:1797.81 E:0.091147 |  So we're waiting for the corner kick to be delivered and it comes now from the left plenty of heights on it
[961.08 - 963.08] P:1777.47 E:0.103467 |  Ruder goes with a header just drops wide
[963.72 - 968.60] P:1705.53 E:0.092516 |  It's been about 10 yards out quite deep inside the penalty area and it was dropping
[969.16 - 973.08] P:1576.40 E:0.095518 |  What would have been the near post as we look the the right hand post from our
[973.64 - 977.48] P:1806.42 E:0.090199 |  position here in the in the main stand in the calipa international stadium
[977.80 - 980.92] P:1624.54 E:0.070782 |  But it dropped wide it'll be a goal kick and it remains goalless
[981.64 - 984.76] P:1556.04 E:0.069433 |  She think it's I don't think it's a great header at all
[985.56 - 988.68] P:1612.56 E:0.077266 |  It goes wide, but it Ruder good should head that back
[989.48 - 993.96] P:1436.35 E:0.083015 |  Trying to head into the the far corner not trying to beat the keeper at his near post
[994.04 - 997.96] P:1433.10 E:0.084577 |  And then maybe the likes of havertz or some of the other german players in the box
[998.60 - 1002.20] P:1685.30 E:0.087519 |  Could attack it and get a touch you go back across the goalkeeper in that situation
[1004.60 - 1009.56] P:1757.65 E:0.093929 |  So each he gone to the goalkeeper all in green away towards our right hand side was looking to try and hit the ball out
[1009.56 - 1013.08] P:1712.28 E:0.084867 |  Towards the right he went central german he got it back but now they've lost it
[1013.40 - 1018.20] P:1847.41 E:0.087387 |  And it's with endo who plays it back to yashida and he goes all the way back to the goalkeeper
[1018.28 - 1024.36] P:1741.91 E:0.082635 |  Who's got enough time to control it with a right footed touch and then strikes it right footed and floats the ball out
[1024.44 - 1027.16] P:1790.11 E:0.092998 |  Towards the far side for the the royal blue
[1027.72 - 1030.52] P:1625.14 E:0.082653 |  Of uh of japan who are playing from right to left
[1030.60 - 1036.12] P:1822.06 E:0.075185 |  But they've lost the ball again in the midfield and there was a clear side of frustration there from the hikamada the
[1036.28 - 1039.24] P:1809.28 E:0.068310 |  26 year old midfielder as we're back now to it

[1061.40 - 1066.68] P:1724.77 E:0.068288 |  Rest assured this one won't end goalless and i said that with a with a degree of faith because
[1067.24 - 1074.04] P:1929.88 E:0.075007 |  None of the last 50 world cup matches involving germany have ended goalless the last goalless draw was actually

[1079.64 - 1083.24] P:1638.60 E:0.079402 |  I speak with a degree of confidence that we will have a goal
[1083.96 - 1087.32] P:1691.18 E:0.075966 |  In this game here in the califa stadium you have been wrong before though

[1101.40 - 1107.24] P:1963.78 E:0.082929 |  Turned away in frustration. He's uttering a word towards the fourth official as shot a bet comes forward now for
[1107.72 - 1110.44] P:1732.64 E:0.073456 |  Germany every outfield player is in the japan half
[1110.52 - 1113.56] P:1785.39 E:0.093034 |  It's gun douan's ball towards ganabri with a cut back on the volley
[1113.88 - 1115.88] P:1801.70 E:0.092587 |  Yoshida first time clears it away
[1116.12 - 1122.60] P:1811.97 E:0.081019 |  Bouncing ball is headed forward by zula now towards kimik, but it was havertz with the challenge and that was on
[1123.56 - 1128.36] P:1649.64 E:0.077853 |  Takufu sakubo and it'll be a free kick to japan
[1129.00 - 1134.92] P:1588.13 E:0.079223 |  And it's been a very quiet opening 19 minutes nil nil very cage. I think japan will be
[1135.56 - 1140.20] P:1635.64 E:0.100953 |  Happy the way things are going just had to be watchful in that situation ganabri will see him
[1141.32 - 1145.16] P:1444.22 E:0.099262 |  More than any of the other german forwards make those runs in behind

[1734.04 - 1738.12] P:1727.17 E:0.097678 |  But again, how much space did round have as it was played into him on that left hand side?
[1738.12 - 1740.92] P:1666.24 E:0.104092 |  You know what? I think it's a really poor pass out to round
[1741.48 - 1744.12] P:1667.81 E:0.098188 |  I think gun douan could have taken the pace off it a little bit
[1745.00 - 1747.88] P:1565.31 E:0.093109 |  But round fires across in left footed and gonder

[1755.72 - 1759.48] P:1668.23 E:0.078359 |  And now they are on the attack with the kubo on this left hand side
[1759.48 - 1764.68] P:1706.83 E:0.100339 |  But he's just simply wrestled away by rudiger and then kubo fouls rudiger
[1765.64 - 1768.44] P:1754.94 E:0.084958 |  But that was just like now shall not pass
[1769.24 - 1771.24] P:1798.04 E:0.059598 |  from from rudiger
[1771.48 - 1775.64] P:1512.94 E:0.077383 |  I mean it's a little bit it was like a doorman lifting someone out of a nightclub, wasn't it?
[1776.68 - 1781.64] P:1612.35 E:0.069558 |  You've probably been in that position a few times. Well, I would imagine that rudiger would have
[1782.36 - 1788.44] P:1642.52 E:0.072272 |  Bearing in mind the physical mismatch between he and and kubo that would be quite easy. I think he wouldn't have
[1789.56 - 1793.80] P:1555.43 E:0.075536 |  He wouldn't have lifted me off the ground as easily although I have lost nearly a stone in weight

[1798.12 - 1801.08] P:1675.64 E:0.068260 |  Here is Sula. He definitely wouldn't have lifted Sula off the ground

[1858.52 - 1865.08] P:1724.80 E:0.092216 |  He gave the penalty the referee and then he looked like he was a little bit unsure, but I thought gondor
[1866.92 - 1875.08] P:1632.08 E:0.076236 |  He looked guilty didn't he that left-hand side. It's a brilliant ball clipped in good run from round. They haven't dealt with him
[1875.64 - 1879.48] P:1742.76 E:0.057249 |  They're checking it. It has to be sufficient

[1904.68 - 1908.28] P:1739.61 E:0.081429 |  Well, I thought I think it's sack high. He's playing so narrow

[2025.32 - 2028.68] P:1636.04 E:0.102864 |  With the giant screen and when it said var goal given
[2029.24 - 2036.36] P:1537.71 E:0.088438 |  Then then they were cheering that decision rather than realizing the ball was the ball was on the spot on the penalty spot
[2036.36 - 2038.36] P:1575.54 E:0.086908 |  That was really strange you
[2039.72 - 2045.72] P:1574.20 E:0.088509 |  You know should get the idea if you watch football regularly that when somebody puts a ball on the penalty spot it means penalty
[2047.64 - 2049.80] P:1667.84 E:0.108714 |  So Germany lead by a goal to nil
[2050.60 - 2052.76] P:1707.50 E:0.099456 |  five live and dbc sounds here
[2053.64 - 2055.64] P:1703.41 E:0.094121 |  11 minutes to go to halftime
[2056.20 - 2058.20] P:1615.31 E:0.073503 |  and uh japan
[2058.20 - 2060.20] P:1758.30 E:0.091684 |  who we haven't really seen
[2060.76 - 2062.36] P:1729.47 E:0.089629 |  much as
[2062.36 - 2064.68] P:1670.30 E:0.097059 |  a great deal of ambition so far from
[2065.48 - 2072.36] P:1760.09 E:0.093289 |  A japan team that was certainly free scoring in qualifying a record 58 goals. They won 15 of their 18 games
[2073.96 - 2079.16] P:1570.60 E:0.096573 |  I mean they're passive. Yes. Yes, they have been but they've set up the counter attack and it's all very well
[2079.16 - 2081.16] P:1552.95 E:0.070175 |  Isn't it at nil nil
[2081.16 - 2084.28] P:1743.69 E:0.088950 |  I'm not sure sure things will change too much at one nil
[2085.32 - 2087.32] P:1615.93 E:0.062723 |  at this stage, but
[2087.32 - 2089.32] P:1564.13 E:0.070569 |  I have been too passive
[2090.04 - 2094.04] P:1719.32 E:0.097307 |  Sakai on the overlap good ground on that right hand side, but
[2095.16 - 2098.36] P:1754.26 E:0.103113 |  It was round who was back with him doing his defensive duties
[2098.36 - 2101.16] P:1583.51 E:0.102774 |  He's hardly played as a left back throughout the whole game so far
[2101.24 - 2104.44] P:1585.95 E:0.087670 |  But on that occasion he did take it away off the toes of the
[2104.92 - 2109.24] P:1527.16 E:0.091014 |  Japanese right back and japan who haven't really done anything in open play
[2109.64 - 2114.04] P:1665.29 E:0.094488 |  Have now got a corner kick on that far side the right to take it which kamara is going to take
[2114.52 - 2118.20] P:1776.14 E:0.099424 |  So this should be an out swinger if he takes it with his right foot on that far side the right
[2118.60 - 2123.64] P:1743.56 E:0.088126 |  Blue shirts white shorts from right to left as we look and we've got under 10 minutes to go to halftime
[2124.28 - 2126.28] P:1602.94 E:0.085074 |  Kamara it is an out swinger and it's
[2127.08 - 2128.92] P:1612.35 E:0.081698 |  headed out by a
[2128.92 - 2130.92] P:1550.66 E:0.071870 |  commanding a rootiga
[2131.00 - 2133.56] P:1566.74 E:0.089679 |  And then nagatomo with the back pass
[2134.20 - 2141.16] P:1746.75 E:0.088071 |  To gonder the goalkeeper who plays it forward to nagatomo who is quickly being chased by three white shirts
[2141.16 - 2145.00] P:1743.37 E:0.087976 |  So japan have to quickly clear the ball and now they win it through sakai
[2145.72 - 2149.40] P:1705.65 E:0.105618 |  Leaps into the air referees played the advantage and it's a good advantage too
[2150.12 - 2153.72] P:1758.82 E:0.099806 |  Because japan now with kubu scoops the ball in towards the penalty area
[2153.80 - 2161.40] P:1692.92 E:0.087380 |  But gunder an was back there helping out off his chest and now it's up to musy ala musy ala to get abri on the halfway line
[2161.64 - 2168.36] P:1698.32 E:0.088515 |  On this near side the right out for a throw and it will be a germany throw chrissa kubo should have made much more of that
[2169.16 - 2175.24] P:1648.37 E:0.088776 |  Kamara he made the initial challenge. I just wonder whether the referee is going to revisit the challenge on kamara
[2176.20 - 2180.20] P:1589.27 E:0.068494 |  The strong challenge was it from schlotterbeck
[2181.32 - 2182.92] P:1509.72 E:0.077536 |  On him but no card
[2182.92 - 2187.48] P:1661.67 E:0.094663 |  But kuba had the opportunity to whip the ball in earlier took an extra touch
[2188.44 - 2190.92] P:1510.16 E:0.086467 |  And then the germans got defenders back in numbers
[2191.56 - 2193.56] P:1568.41 E:0.095937 |  Have to make more of those opportunities
[2194.76 - 2196.76] P:1572.41 E:0.088916 |  Yes, they certainly do because they've been
[2197.96 - 2201.24] P:1792.35 E:0.102483 |  Few and far between in this first half and we've been playing for
[2201.88 - 2203.48] P:1766.38 E:0.070096 |  37 minutes
[2203.48 - 2211.24] P:1659.36 E:0.074612 |  Here in the caliphe international stadium where germany lead by a golden ill from this penalty spot taken by

[2218.84 - 2220.84] P:1745.05 E:0.058128 |  But it's with
[2221.72 - 2223.72] P:1817.39 E:0.075245 |  Itung far side the right
[2224.84 - 2226.84] P:1834.15 E:0.077316 |  No impression whatsoever
[2226.92 - 2228.92] P:1773.53 E:0.068598 |  germany dealing with that threat and
[2229.56 - 2230.84] P:1681.59 E:0.018363 |  kimmick

[2233.24 - 2235.80] P:1711.10 E:0.070454 |  I can actually hear a fella shouting from the far side
[2237.08 - 2239.08] P:1932.43 E:0.087667 |  Takes you it takes you back to when you used to
[2239.96 - 2241.96] P:1767.33 E:0.078591 |  Come and take playing behind closed doors
[2242.28 - 2247.00] P:1778.66 E:0.067171 |  If you've just tuned on or tuned five live now or BBC sounds and you're thinking
[2248.36 - 2250.36] P:1696.45 E:0.058561 |  Oun is in this stadium
[2250.36 - 2252.36] P:1724.65 E:0.055883 |  Not many empty seats
[2252.36 - 2254.36] P:1667.04 E:0.090767 |  You wouldn't think 45,000
[2254.52 - 2257.48] P:1678.88 E:0.089851 |  Canaveral shoots from distance that was blocked ball played out
[2257.88 - 2264.36] P:1608.68 E:0.078092 |  Now it's with havertz right corner of the area to thomas moeller moeller sends over the cross left foot in
[2264.84 - 2266.84] P:1639.26 E:0.063869 |  It was back there helping out
[2267.00 - 2268.12] P:1843.99 E:0.058550 |  Schlotterbeck
[2268.12 - 2274.60] P:1685.24 E:0.090091 |  25 yards out musy a la with the shot up in the air punched down into the ground by gondor comes out to kimmick
[2275.00 - 2277.00] P:1726.26 E:0.104568 |  Ball played into the penalty area low
[2277.40 - 2281.88] P:1797.20 E:0.093085 |  Nobody seemed to want to have a go at goal there as gondor was having to retreat to his goal line
[2282.92 - 2284.92] P:1677.61 E:0.064658 |  But germany looked very very comfortable
[2285.32 - 2291.72] P:1614.40 E:0.088278 |  Yeah, at this moment in time japan eventually will have to change their game plan. They're happy to defend in numbers and break out but
[2292.92 - 2298.04] P:1601.84 E:0.084034 |  The germans have that swagger that arrogance. No, I think the issue with the crowd
[2299.08 - 2301.08] P:1582.21 E:0.079554 |  said to one of our producers
[2301.96 - 2304.44] P:1460.40 E:0.088083 |  Last evening it's a corporate crowd, isn't it?
[2305.48 - 2307.48] P:1599.89 E:0.049535 |  Braun sandwich brigade
[2309.08 - 2313.16] P:1769.35 E:0.069436 |  Well, actually it there's probably more empty seats in the in the corporate boxes
[2313.40 - 2320.04] P:1732.83 E:0.075903 |  Mind you have not surprised with the the eye watering prices that you charged in there, but they didn't appear to be too many in
[2320.92 - 2325.32] P:1887.84 E:0.076184 |  those burgundy seats in the the middle tier some behind glass
[2326.04 - 2328.04] P:1719.56 E:0.062702 |  some out in the open
[2328.36 - 2331.96] P:1849.43 E:0.089174 |  I mean, there's a large chunk of royal blue on the far side, but
[2333.24 - 2336.68] P:1667.96 E:0.074752 |  The japanese supporter are silent. Yeah, well, they're losing
[2337.24 - 2339.40] P:1292.11 E:0.091458 |  Um, but it may be the lack of alcohol as well
[2340.68 - 2342.68] P:1616.74 E:0.037650 |  in the stadiums
[2342.76 - 2344.76] P:1218.92 E:0.075648 |  People get louder after a drink don't they?
[2346.28 - 2348.28] P:1571.68 E:0.030945 |  I wouldn't know here in Qatar
[2349.40 - 2351.80] P:1697.89 E:0.086132 |  Six minutes into the into the second half
[2352.92 - 2355.96] P:1729.00 E:0.074812 |  Well, they could that japanese traveling support needs to take a

[2364.76 - 2367.32] P:1672.65 E:0.094843 |  As Kubo is forward, but he won't keep that ball in play
[2368.12 - 2371.48] P:1587.85 E:0.091186 |  Actually he does with a cutback now. It's a late flag. Didn't think he had
[2371.80 - 2373.80] P:1371.80 E:0.099263 |  He's actually gone down with an injury as well
[2374.68 - 2376.68] P:1715.78 E:0.070486 |  There's there isn't much
[2376.68 - 2382.28] P:1632.32 E:0.086672 |  Where there's a switch from the turf to the artificial turf that can cause problems for players
[2384.04 - 2390.04] P:1703.13 E:0.085202 |  You haven't yeah, I mean, it's it's the same in you know in in english stadiums, isn't it there's

[2424.60 - 2427.56] P:1471.88 E:0.066356 |  There's not a wave breaking out and that was one of the smallest
[2429.00 - 2430.44] P:1625.48 E:0.081846 |  Ever wasn't it stopped?
[2430.44 - 2432.44] P:1552.56 E:0.028981 |  Yeah, well
[2432.60 - 2437.48] P:1646.47 E:0.090015 |  Maybe what do you say the corporate brigade aren't used to tossing their prawn sandwiches in the air
[2437.96 - 2442.12] P:1650.66 E:0.098012 |  Here is uh gunduan gunduan from distance charged down and picked up
[2445.08 - 2447.08] P:1524.78 E:0.094043 |  And it's eventually taking off
[2447.16 - 2449.16] P:1516.15 E:0.091040 |  It started off as a ripple
[2449.48 - 2454.20] P:1656.29 E:0.100022 |  And now all of a sudden it's sweeping around this vast stadium that holds 45
[2454.44 - 2460.84] P:1513.15 E:0.084018 |  And a half thousand people here inside the calipa stadium where german he lead by a golden ill

[2482.44 - 2484.44] P:1214.90 E:0.119014 |  Oh, it's going around now it

[2491.08 - 2493.08] P:1498.95 E:0.099056 |  Yeah, I'm tempted to join in
[2496.52 - 2498.28] P:1430.56 E:0.073852 |  Japan
[2498.28 - 2500.28] P:1784.08 E:0.097113 |  Playing at such a sedate pace

[2504.68 - 2506.68] P:1563.04 E:0.100932 |  There's got to be a little bit more intensity

[2528.36 - 2530.36] P:1421.34 E:0.111499 |  I think that's the criticism of the

[2536.20 - 2538.52] P:1410.10 E:0.109163 |  He sets his team up quite negatively

[2542.76 - 2544.36] P:1530.93 E:0.099128 |  I'm gonna have to
[2544.36 - 2550.84] P:1388.79 E:0.112788 |  Try and take the game to the germans much more and go toe to toe. Maybe that will happen, but they're on one to concede a second

[2600.04 - 2602.84] P:1584.93 E:0.098286 |  That was risky for him. He'd so let it go across his body
[2603.40 - 2607.48] P:1681.60 E:0.097224 |  He's actually conceded possession. He had a chance to clear it, but he's given it back to germany

[2639.00 - 2641.80] P:1699.75 E:0.101585 |  So tentative they're not given the germans anything to think about
[2642.36 - 2646.28] P:1623.86 E:0.078492 |  And the germans totally dominant
[2650.44 - 2657.24] P:1673.58 E:0.112864 |  All played out by noyya to schlotterbeck who can pick up that ball about 25 yards out from his own goal
[2657.64 - 2663.16] P:1709.46 E:0.112272 |  He's over the halfway line and he's now midway through the japan half as he lays it off towards gunduan
[2663.64 - 2667.40] P:1834.33 E:0.108588 |  We hear german voices inside the calipa international stadium
[2667.72 - 2673.24] P:1744.66 E:0.112237 |  Germany lead by a golden ill musyala shot turn on the shot right foot on the rise
[2673.72 - 2675.72] P:1649.51 E:0.100687 |  Just on the edge of the area
[2675.72 - 2681.80] P:1456.59 E:0.109581 |  Couldn't keep it down gold kick 1-0 germany close to half time. Yeah razor sharp from musyala
[2683.72 - 2687.24] P:1623.91 E:0.096480 |  Gets on the half turn dynamic creates a
[2688.12 - 2692.60] P:1551.52 E:0.108359 |  Half a yard of space should do better with the shot balls fist indivite
[2693.64 - 2695.40] P:1250.90 E:0.095436 |  kimmick
[2695.96 - 2703.24] P:1441.78 E:0.112090 |  It's akura who comes out tries to shut him down, but quick touch with it outside of his right foot away and then he lifts the ball
[2704.44 - 2706.44] P:1191.88 E:0.101833 |  Well over gondas bar
[2707.64 - 2711.40] P:1462.65 E:0.108331 |  Four minutes have added on time in the first half
[2713.00 - 2717.32] P:1342.91 E:0.110796 |  As there's a another stoppage sakai has gone down on the far side
[2720.52 - 2722.52] P:1474.64 E:0.107758 |  I wouldn't have said four minutes
[2722.84 - 2725.64] P:1420.81 E:0.099516 |  Probably you have said 60 seconds
[2726.76 - 2730.28] P:1388.77 E:0.108627 |  One one stoppage with an injury no substitutions
[2731.64 - 2736.84] P:1158.51 E:0.109804 |  What is it that the uh figure of wanting? I don't mind this I don't I don't mind it, you know
[2738.28 - 2744.76] P:1434.54 E:0.108838 |  The balls that have played a lot isn't it see players time waste you just want you want your pie. That's what you're thinking about
[2746.20 - 2749.64] P:1503.89 E:0.113062 |  Argentina, Saudi Arabia, I think they played about 15 minutes of
[2750.20 - 2754.92] P:1415.79 E:0.101084 |  Stoppage time in the second half that's like having a game go to the first period of extra time
[2755.88 - 2758.52] P:1560.42 E:0.118513 |  It's one bill to Germany. We're in stoppage time here
[2759.24 - 2761.80] P:1298.52 E:0.110714 |  in Qatar DBC radio five live
[2763.96 - 2766.60] P:1517.56 E:0.119806 |  And it's a throw to japan on the halfway line
[2767.16 - 2772.36] P:1442.68 E:0.105477 |  It's that they've shown such a lack of ambition. Maybe it will come in the second half
[2772.44 - 2775.80] P:1306.58 E:0.090188 |  Here is havertz
[2776.52 - 2781.40] P:1494.94 E:0.113223 |  Again, they're attacking on the left. Busy Allah round on the overlap. Busy Allah goes in alone

[2787.72 - 2791.88] P:1539.67 E:0.111714 |  Level the penalty area here. He is he goes inside. Busy Allah always sharp
[2792.36 - 2795.80] P:1504.65 E:0.105809 |  Swear pulled back Sula joins the attack the right back
[2796.20 - 2801.24] P:1473.11 E:0.105118 |  What about the dig didn't blaze it out towards mula crosses around knee height
[2801.32 - 2806.28] P:1328.91 E:0.103883 |  Hard for gimmick to control that ball inside the penalty area and japan will get it away
[2807.32 - 2809.56] P:1444.58 E:0.109399 |  But it's going to keep coming back out of them
[2810.52 - 2816.04] P:1487.74 E:0.113780 |  This is all about how much germany and bearing in mind when it comes to the criteria of the group
[2816.84 - 2818.52] P:1374.00 E:0.086970 |  goal difference
[2818.52 - 2821.72] P:1511.81 E:0.105782 |  Could be key and this potentially could be a difficult group
[2822.84 - 2827.64] P:1344.02 E:0.105065 |  You would think that germany would want more goals than just the one that they've got so far
[2828.60 - 2830.60] P:1471.15 E:0.107237 |  Yep, that pretty much sums up
[2832.12 - 2838.52] P:1495.73 E:0.110975 |  Japan's first half performance at yashida getting the ball edge of his own box nothing on and just punting a ball

[2844.12 - 2847.16] P:1364.68 E:0.109363 |  I mean they may as well go home japan if they're going to be this negative
[2850.44 - 2853.80] P:1452.08 E:0.115598 |  A sense of adventure surely awaits in the second half

[2896.36 - 2899.24] P:1421.13 E:0.111189 |  I'm doing a game every day for the next three months. I think
[2901.72 - 2908.04] P:1585.11 E:0.109151 |  Germany chance maybe in this stop is time to increase their league in every pixel up runs into the space
[2908.04 - 2914.20] P:1735.95 E:0.116517 |  He's got support musy a la plays it out towards mula mula to the byline chips it towards the far post
[2914.52 - 2916.52] P:1614.24 E:0.114073 |  Downward header comes towards it's a cooler
[2917.00 - 2919.00] P:1802.80 E:0.117796 |  shot comes in
[2919.16 - 2921.16] P:1762.00 E:0.116317 |  close range
[2923.24 - 2925.24] P:1676.21 E:0.118044 |  Wonder whether he's offside
[2925.24 - 2930.76] P:1687.90 E:0.117627 |  Just wonder whether he's offside. I think the germans deserve to go in at the break more than one up
[2932.76 - 2935.16] P:1795.61 E:0.118128 |  The looking for the flag but the flag is stayed down
[2936.12 - 2942.84] P:1726.01 E:0.113995 |  Certainly vr will have a look as it was crossed from the left hand side. It was a simple tapping for kai havertz
[2943.48 - 2945.48] P:1701.88 E:0.108325 |  He did have a little glance around
[2945.72 - 2949.32] P:1612.42 E:0.107252 |  But japan never dealt with the danger. No the ball stood up from mula
[2949.96 - 2954.04] P:1691.77 E:0.102149 |  And it's headed away kimmick with a left footer shot. He is outside won't count
[2954.76 - 2957.72] P:1658.90 E:0.116438 |  Yeah, it's musy a la. I don't know whether it's a shot or a cross and
[2958.44 - 2959.88] P:1436.67 E:0.094155 |  havertz
[2959.88 - 2962.76] P:1651.01 E:0.098600 |  centrally just beyond I think it's
[2963.72 - 2965.72] P:1551.07 E:0.083510 |  It's a yashida
[2967.72 - 2969.72] P:1581.03 E:0.081230 |  Yeah, it's a shot I think from
[2970.76 - 2972.76] P:1550.70 E:0.093276 |  The wide area
[2972.76 - 2977.56] P:1680.04 E:0.102106 |  As the shot came in initially from kimmick it was saved by the goalkeeper musy a la then from the left hand side
[2978.12 - 2982.28] P:1556.32 E:0.097188 |  But the assistant referee never raised his flag at all even late
[2984.20 - 2987.40] P:1494.99 E:0.104280 |  So what's going on here there the vr are having having a look again
[2987.64 - 2993.00] P:1471.90 E:0.084437 |  I mean all the players are set up to kick off again aren't they from the center circle
[2995.72 - 2997.72] P:1764.20 E:0.128664 |  Here we go
[2997.88 - 3003.00] P:1666.34 E:0.113845 |  We're taking the time aren't they well I was going to say through a vr check that surely has to be one of the easiest ones
[3005.40 - 3009.16] P:1504.92 E:0.125054 |  First glance that we saw it on the monitor we were able to say that it was offside
[3009.96 - 3015.08] P:1431.92 E:0.118063 |  You can hear the japanese fans are happy with that maybe we'll see another wave around the stadium
[3016.04 - 3017.08] P:1525.17 E:0.104338 |  Well
[3017.08 - 3023.08] P:1481.38 E:0.114640 |  Certainly it's a less off for jupan because there have been no way back from two nil down the way they played in the first half
[3023.56 - 3028.20] P:1467.27 E:0.114985 |  But kai havertz's goal in first half stoppage time ruled out for offside
[3028.76 - 3033.16] P:1576.54 E:0.117590 |  Nakatomo with a cross from the left and the header just wide it was by a
[3034.36 - 3036.04] P:1575.29 E:0.103222 |  12 yards out
[3036.04 - 3038.68] P:1559.17 E:0.118630 |  Just tried to glance it by adjusting his upper body
[3039.16 - 3043.88] P:1399.40 E:0.109628 |  And it ran wide by about a good two yards to the right hand post fast side one nil germany
[3043.96 - 3046.60] P:1507.67 E:0.111897 |  Yeah, nakatomo just creating a little bit of space
[3047.32 - 3049.32] P:1616.52 E:0.096112 |  chops inside
[3049.32 - 3052.04] P:1503.16 E:0.115089 |  On his right foot whips a ball in and here made a
[3052.92 - 3055.32] P:1622.93 E:0.115156 |  10 yards out it's a difficult one because it's behind him
[3055.32 - 3057.64] P:1629.59 E:0.113799 |  And he's just trying to use the the pace of the ball
[3057.64 - 3061.32] P:1476.91 E:0.105594 |  It's an in-swinger to direct it on target but it goes wide
[3061.96 - 3063.96] P:1649.19 E:0.112704 |  It's the halftime whistle
[3063.96 - 3071.16] P:1681.49 E:0.117400 |  Halftime germany japan by a golden ill japan had a goal ruled out for offside in the early stages after eight minutes
[3071.96 - 3074.44] P:1665.56 E:0.119487 |  It was into with the the cross beta
[3075.40 - 3077.40] P:1455.57 E:0.105151 |  The good yard offside
[3077.40 - 3078.44] P:1168.30 E:0.096860 |  and then
[3078.44 - 3083.00] P:1553.66 E:0.113065 |  Gundewaad with a penalty put germany ahead after 33 minutes and then germany had a goal
[3083.32 - 3088.36] P:1553.64 E:0.104383 |  Quite rightly ruled out offside for havertz from close range in first half stoppage time
[3088.44 - 3092.92] P:1507.08 E:0.110704 |  So halftime here in the kalifa international stadium. It's germany won
[3093.16 - 3095.16] P:1290.02 E:0.070542 |  Mike japan nil
[3095.16 - 3097.16] P:1398.46 E:0.085139 |  Chris
[3100.92 - 3102.92] P:1204.72 E:0.094837 |  Yeah, yeah
[3103.32 - 3107.64] P:1403.76 E:0.097466 |  I'm marketer knee there. Oh, did you take any headphones off? What would you do?
[3107.96 - 3109.96] P:1168.60 E:0.112840 |  No, no, I just
[3111.88 - 3116.84] P:1477.00 E:0.091681 |  Silence there and myself and Ian looked at each other bemused as we have done for most of the first half
[3117.72 - 3119.72] P:1467.70 E:0.065367 |  Japan's performance is
[3120.36 - 3122.04] P:1578.46 E:0.066194 |  As much as anything
[3122.04 - 3126.36] P:1727.08 E:0.088821 |  It's been a strange performance from the japan. We know they you know, they like to counter attack
[3126.36 - 3131.72] P:1593.30 E:0.090740 |  But they've shown a real lack of ambition especially after the the german goal germany have had a lot of joy
[3131.80 - 3134.84] P:1508.11 E:0.088132 |  Haven't they down that left hand side? I think it was a penalty
[3135.72 - 3138.76] P:1338.62 E:0.086690 |  Um, you know ram was brought down as a gondogaf
[3139.40 - 3143.64] P:1626.66 E:0.097870 |  And then the germany have just dominated and you know nearly had the second just before halftime
[3144.12 - 3144.76] P:1263.14 E:0.108184 |  What do we know?
[3144.76 - 3151.48] P:1546.69 E:0.091524 |  We know that japan have to be more adventurous in this second half and and risk losing the game to try and get back in the game
[3151.48 - 3155.00] P:1587.59 E:0.085687 |  But I've been slightly disappointed with japan's reaction
[3155.48 - 3160.84] P:1524.14 E:0.093700 |  After the first goal more than anything because you know, it's okay to set up and and try and keep things tight
[3160.84 - 3164.52] P:1557.92 E:0.078466 |  And you know we understand that and it's okay to set up the counter attack
[3164.52 - 3168.36] P:1581.53 E:0.080018 |  But the goal changes everything and you know, I'm sure second half
[3168.44 - 3175.16] P:1567.12 E:0.083925 |  Well, I'm not sure second half, but I'd like to think that the japanese who have some really creative players show more intent in the second period
[3176.52 - 3179.32] P:1680.66 E:0.091097 |  You've both talked about the crowd during that first half
[3179.88 - 3184.68] P:1621.37 E:0.085588 |  Do you think at all it some of the crowd noise doesn't sound very authentic to me?
[3184.92 - 3187.48] P:1678.14 E:0.090187 |  I'd I thought that during the england game at that stadium
[3188.68 - 3190.12] P:1554.56 E:0.072364 |  Do you know what?
[3190.12 - 3192.52] P:1659.94 E:0.076099 |  I've got a suspicion that the
[3193.56 - 3195.56] P:1597.19 E:0.076044 |  section where
[3195.56 - 3197.56] P:1458.09 E:0.079603 |  They are banging the drum
[3197.80 - 3205.16] P:1644.85 E:0.087299 |  From the right hand side. They are a good two three four blocks away from the main support of
[3205.40 - 3206.44] P:1407.35 E:0.069596 |  of
[3206.44 - 3209.64] P:1587.70 E:0.095120 |  Whether japanese fans in their thousands on that far side
[3210.36 - 3213.08] P:1893.05 E:0.092164 |  and you know that there were some england supporters who
[3214.44 - 3215.56] P:1339.34 E:0.073903 |  were
[3215.56 - 3218.52] P:1515.12 E:0.095118 |  Came over to katar and they were invited over by katar
[3219.24 - 3222.04] P:1527.53 E:0.094558 |  I just wonder if they are the the hired help
[3222.92 - 3224.12] P:1573.84 E:0.074044 |  okay
[3224.12 - 3226.12] P:1772.32 E:0.102790 |  archery and took football
[3226.84 - 3234.60] P:1525.35 E:0.089833 |  German football expert been listening to the german commentary of this which obviously is not at the standard of ian and christ
[3234.60 - 3236.04] P:1548.45 E:0.073762 |  I would imagine
[3236.04 - 3238.04] P:1761.17 E:0.104747 |  Archie what have they been saying?
[3238.12 - 3240.60] P:1694.64 E:0.082379 |  What have they been saying about that first 45 minutes?
[3241.32 - 3243.32] P:1377.26 E:0.081849 |  It's a bit less moany than chris isn't it?
[3246.76 - 3254.12] P:1470.14 E:0.074512 |  Well the funny thing for me was as soon as the the gundewan penalty went in like after all this uncertainty
[3254.60 - 3255.64] P:1571.44 E:0.036986 |  from
[3255.64 - 3262.20] P:1530.54 E:0.083076 |  From the germans before this tournament suddenly the commentator goes well the first goal in the world cup in 2014 was also a penalty
[3262.20 - 3264.20] P:1429.37 E:0.091208 |  But let's not get to ahead of ourselves
[3265.08 - 3271.48] P:1287.62 E:0.084069 |  So yeah, I think on the whole it's been encouraging but also like there's something about
[3272.04 - 3273.32] P:1148.23 E:0.078165 |  the way that
[3273.32 - 3277.40] P:1244.00 E:0.089333 |  The germans look at football that they are very very critical
[3277.80 - 3283.80] P:1451.78 E:0.085286 |  And I was having a chat with with daniel farka the from a norwich boss and and brucey mentioned glad back coach now
[3284.28 - 3287.96] P:1409.06 E:0.092060 |  About this and he says it's something in their nature that sometimes they overdo it
[3288.44 - 3295.32] P:1403.55 E:0.082373 |  That said I think that there is still a worry about even if as christ says there's been a lack of ambition
[3295.56 - 3296.76] P:1045.45 E:0.067875 |  From japan
[3296.76 - 3302.28] P:1236.65 E:0.092692 |  An old problem rearing its head again with that disallowed goal by japan early in the in the first half
[3302.76 - 3308.20] P:1470.42 E:0.088106 |  With just how vulnerable germany looked on the counter and this is one of the weaknesses of hansey flick
[3308.20 - 3312.28] P:1534.06 E:0.079934 |  I would say as a coach is that he can be so attacking at times
[3312.68 - 3318.20] P:1285.49 E:0.084327 |  That at bayan he could get away with it because he had this wonderful defensive mop called alfonso davis
[3318.52 - 3320.20] P:1384.11 E:0.083200 |  david raum is good
[3320.20 - 3325.80] P:1418.86 E:0.078677 |  But he is not nearly as as quick as alfonso davis is and yeah, that's just one thing for germany
[3325.80 - 3331.64] P:1488.74 E:0.092691 |  But overall encouraging first half for them and on the one love armband the german interior minister
[3332.60 - 3336.52] P:1590.93 E:0.099700 |  Nancy feiser shown wearing that one love armband in the stadium
[3336.92 - 3343.56] P:1561.81 E:0.096900 |  The german team for their team photo putting their hands over their mouths very much like players talk to each other at the end of
[3343.72 - 3347.24] P:1758.35 E:0.092595 |  Of a game actually, but the but the german football team twitter account
[3347.96 - 3353.40] P:1550.82 E:0.105224 |  Saying it wasn't about making a political statement human rights are non-negotiable. That shouldn't be taken for granted
[3353.48 - 3357.64] P:1539.60 E:0.087233 |  It still isn't the case. Sorry that should be taken for granted, but it still isn't the case
[3357.96 - 3364.36] P:1548.12 E:0.096162 |  That's why this message is so important to us denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our
[3364.92 - 3366.44] P:1218.53 E:0.040570 |  position
[3367.08 - 3368.84] P:1284.86 E:0.084175 |  I think it's significant
[3368.84 - 3371.24] P:1316.34 E:0.095520 |  This this protest but at the same time
[3371.40 - 3372.28] P:1259.86 E:0.062405 |  I think
[3372.28 - 3375.08] P:1479.89 E:0.084281 |  When we look at what counts as being powerful
[3375.72 - 3381.96] P:1445.86 E:0.091106 |  In sport you have to sacrifice something and the question to the players at the heart of this whole armband saga was
[3382.28 - 3386.20] P:1508.57 E:0.082630 |  How much do you care about what has happened for this tournament to take place?
[3387.00 - 3389.00] P:1480.28 E:0.091698 |  and I think that too much
[3389.64 - 3391.64] P:1542.44 E:0.085517 |  They've wanted to have their cake and eat it
[3392.20 - 3394.92] P:1563.58 E:0.083393 |  And look would it have been more powerful?
[3395.00 - 3398.60] P:1437.63 E:0.088604 |  Have they gone ahead and won and worn the one love armband?
[3398.60 - 3402.20] P:1532.27 E:0.078954 |  I think it would have been because that would have been a direct contradiction
[3402.52 - 3406.76] P:1468.11 E:0.084473 |  This I think works as a gesture, but it still does feel
[3407.40 - 3409.56] P:1539.95 E:0.087372 |  Like it fits in too much with
[3410.20 - 3412.20] P:1538.65 E:0.080073 |  Yeah, everything else. I think
[3412.28 - 3417.40] P:1452.34 E:0.091728 |  You need to step over the line in a different way for it to really have a powerful effect

[3565.96 - 3569.88] P:1810.00 E:0.099825 |  Good excellent excellent. Yeah rob green alongside vicky
[3570.44 - 3573.00] P:1939.41 E:0.106271 |  Spain will be feeling exactly the same as germany
[3573.32 - 3578.44] P:1806.23 E:0.097918 |  Prematch rob won't they in in that the fact that these two are in the same group. They need to get off to a good start
[3579.64 - 3583.56] P:1906.47 E:0.081519 |  I think even more so for spain in the fact that they are playing the game
[3584.20 - 3591.24] P:1917.24 E:0.085233 |  Probably the least fancy team out the group again costa rica punching above their weight to qualify getting here
[3592.12 - 3598.44] P:1837.03 E:0.083672 |  They thrive or have created their success on defensive know how not so much on attacking prowess
[3598.44 - 3600.44] P:2007.15 E:0.077689 |  So to keep the ball
[3600.60 - 3604.20] P:1891.35 E:0.080253 |  Is what we know spain for so then to go and score the goals
[3604.28 - 3609.96] P:1814.91 E:0.083631 |  They haven't got the out and out they've got over a marata. They've had a problem in giving him arrest or
[3610.60 - 3615.88] P:1810.74 E:0.084644 |  Taking his place as such and so the goals where they come from against a really dogged side
[3616.36 - 3620.76] P:1865.09 E:0.071717 |  Is going to be the question today for spain. Yeah, you feel like with the other two teams looming
[3620.84 - 3622.84] P:1568.95 E:0.065533 |  They need to come up with something today
[3622.84 - 3629.88] P:1746.58 E:0.086414 |  Spain have been improving vicky under Lewis Henry K who of course is is twitching his way through this world cup
[3631.56 - 3635.16] P:1761.67 E:0.090713 |  He's such an interesting character, isn't he to watch down on the touch line
[3635.24 - 3640.28] P:1630.00 E:0.093616 |  He's contracting to then he is up at the end of the year and he says he won't sign a new one until after the world cup because
[3640.52 - 3646.04] P:1672.22 E:0.096629 |  If things go wrong you and by that he means the media won't have to ask me to be fired
[3646.20 - 3652.20] P:1700.16 E:0.085477 |  But yeah, I think what's so exciting about spain at this tournament is what we saw at the euros as well
[3652.28 - 3655.32] P:1603.09 E:0.085205 |  And of course they they reach the semi finals and only lost on penalties
[3655.80 - 3660.76] P:1868.64 E:0.086474 |  To italy is that there is such a young attacking feel about this side
[3660.84 - 3664.28] P:1821.52 E:0.091116 |  But but it's a young attacking side that is already so experienced
[3664.36 - 3666.52] P:1727.25 E:0.101282 |  I mean you've got pedri and gavi who are
[3667.00 - 3673.16] P:1660.21 E:0.092429 |  Doing so well at a club level for for Barcelona and often when you talk about young sides coming into a tournament
[3673.16 - 3679.16] P:1674.33 E:0.086805 |  You're looking for maybe players that people haven't heard of or ones that are going to take a tournament by storm and by surprise
[3679.24 - 3681.96] P:2021.65 E:0.077538 |  But that's it when you look at this spain side. Do you think yes?
[3682.04 - 3686.92] P:1770.77 E:0.094749 |  Although these players are still young they feel as though they're already doing it on the big stage
[3687.40 - 3690.28] P:1790.87 E:0.087779 |  Domestically regularly we can we count for their clubs
[3690.68 - 3693.40] P:1821.46 E:0.092957 |  A lot of them have had experience of the euros as well
[3693.88 - 3700.04] P:1670.21 E:0.095986 |  Last summer and can they then go all the way and let's not forget spain's under 23s at the olympics last summer as well
[3700.12 - 3706.20] P:1801.06 E:0.087479 |  Picked up the silver medal against brazil so it's it's this this generation coming through of course with the experience heads such as
[3706.68 - 3714.76] P:1795.74 E:0.078924 |  Sergio busquets as well, but the mix is exciting very exciting for spain that game kicks off in two hours time
[3715.24 - 3720.12] P:1616.48 E:0.085385 |  It's two minutes plus five here in doha and darkness has already fallen
[3720.12 - 3726.04] P:1855.63 E:0.088658 |  Let's just switch to england jordan pickford's been talking to the media ahead of friday's game against the usa
[3726.36 - 3731.40] P:1565.80 E:0.085937 |  He was asked how harry cayden is doing after he had a scanner on his right ankle. I think he's good
[3731.72 - 3735.32] P:1456.10 E:0.075476 |  Um, probably be a little bit sore, but I think he's fine. He's out on the grass today with us
[3735.32 - 3739.72] P:1775.26 E:0.062999 |  So that's good and he's a he's our captain and I think he he's fine. Yeah
[3740.44 - 3743.80] P:1352.07 E:0.088722 |  That's a huge relief to a lot of people in this room and to england fans all around the place
[3743.88 - 3746.36] P:1462.29 E:0.080840 |  I mean is he there's so much talent in this england squad
[3746.60 - 3752.68] P:1302.40 E:0.071125 |  So I mean no disrespect to anybody else in the squad, but is he the one player that's irreplaceable if he's injured
[3753.48 - 3756.44] P:1653.75 E:0.078906 |  No, I think everyone will take the chance. I think when harry came off
[3756.60 - 3757.96] P:1313.74 E:0.040578 |  um
[3757.96 - 3762.44] P:1820.05 E:0.067731 |  About 70 minutes calum come on and played really well got the assist for jack
[3762.52 - 3767.56] P:1852.15 E:0.071460 |  He's very unselfish and give jack his goal and um, I think everyone's training really hard
[3767.64 - 3770.04] P:1612.79 E:0.068843 |  Everyone's here for a reason to play football and
[3770.60 - 3773.00] P:1488.39 E:0.058483 |  um, yeah, but obviously harry
[3773.64 - 3779.48] P:1691.39 E:0.070246 |  Is unbelievable player he's he sets the example in the squad. He's the leader. He's a captain and we all look up to him
[3779.56 - 3783.48] P:1576.63 E:0.049064 |  Um, but yeah, there's also opportunities for volads as well
[3784.04 - 3785.88] P:1243.62 E:0.082964 |  garrus already voiced
[3785.88 - 3791.00] P:1092.72 E:0.089511 |  Concern that england were used as an example of a goal that shouldn't stood in the in the referees meeting
[3791.32 - 3794.04] P:1363.47 E:0.085357 |  The penalty shout against harry didn't go your way
[3794.68 - 3798.04] P:1593.15 E:0.086043 |  How worried are you that england might face unfair treatment here?
[3798.76 - 3803.56] P:1554.62 E:0.065140 |  Yeah, god brought up in the referees meeting much wish we were involved in um, but
[3804.28 - 3807.56] P:1706.40 E:0.064291 |  hopefully we get fair fair side of it and um,
[3808.20 - 3811.32] P:1552.54 E:0.068983 |  You know, it's never going to be perfect. I think you're never going to get both
[3812.12 - 3816.44] P:1622.78 E:0.062103 |  Be happy all the time with ve our decisions and but you know, I think harry's one was
[3817.00 - 3823.48] P:1712.25 E:0.064999 |  Could have been a penalty from even my point of view, but yeah, you can't can always be perfect from the referee side and um
[3824.04 - 3827.24] P:1628.52 E:0.063663 |  Just hopefully we'll we'll get our decisions when we feel like we need them
[3829.08 - 3836.52] P:1599.61 E:0.086815 |  Jordan pickford there um the main thing rob green on that is that that harry cayne is out on the grass despite having his scam
[3837.56 - 3842.60] P:1709.62 E:0.088185 |  Yes, and after the game he was seen wearing a light strapping now with an ankle injury
[3842.68 - 3844.20] P:1659.77 E:0.075926 |  Normally what you see is
[3844.20 - 3849.80] P:1655.96 E:0.087762 |  Even as a precautionary measure the boot that we see so often with injured players on having it put on
[3850.52 - 3855.72] P:1620.17 E:0.084485 |  Just to make sure to keep it immobile to take the weight off that wasn't deemed necessary
[3855.80 - 3858.04] P:1784.56 E:0.086125 |  So it clearly was a precautionary scan
[3858.60 - 3865.00] P:1669.73 E:0.085497 |  Hearts are always in mouths and uh, I thought actually jordan pickford did quite well not to take that personally when they asked
[3865.08 - 3867.32] P:1547.95 E:0.095902 |  Is he the only player not to be replaceable?
[3868.12 - 3870.12] P:1540.84 E:0.090387 |  Thanks very much
[3871.40 - 3873.40] P:1602.71 E:0.078955 |  How would you how would you have responded to that?
[3874.44 - 3876.44] P:1617.05 E:0.061760 |  I wouldn't have been asked
[3879.88 - 3884.52] P:1647.46 E:0.073404 |  Well, there is there is strength in depth though at the keeper at the keeper position, isn't there?
[3885.24 - 3890.20] P:1525.78 E:0.087318 |  Yes, and you you'd look at that and you look at harry cayne and look at what the qualities that he does have and
[3890.36 - 3897.40] P:1752.79 E:0.076561 |  Callum Wilson has different qualities as a centre forward now some games they might be more suited to callum wilson, but you would say
[3898.12 - 3902.84] P:1729.01 E:0.070930 |  The the amount of goals purely alone that harry cayne has brought in such
[3903.56 - 3909.64] P:1761.08 E:0.087314 |  Important situations and such a big stage that he is the man and he will be for this tournament alone
[3911.08 - 3916.44] P:1653.76 E:0.081678 |  But if they didn't need to risk him against the usa, maybe they could maybe they could maybe they could leave him out
[3917.24 - 3920.36] P:1696.32 E:0.093411 |  Get the points on the board, please and get it over the line
[3920.60 - 3925.88] P:1603.22 E:0.078845 |  And then you know what I think wales might turn around and say actually if you want to risk him for a game or
[3926.44 - 3929.32] P:1615.10 E:0.089929 |  Easy moth for a game then let it be us, but uh, yeah

[3954.84 - 3960.76] P:1584.71 E:0.086402 |  chris, uh, talk about the prawn sandwich eating brigade during the first half my researcher
[3961.72 - 3967.72] P:1606.88 E:0.077620 |  Here during the course that half tells me that you've been having quite a lot of prawn sandwiches on this trip
[3968.68 - 3971.48] P:1698.92 E:0.065782 |  Uh, who's who dropped you that?
[3972.44 - 3974.44] P:1692.44 E:0.074052 |  Yeah, you're your roommate
[3974.52 - 3979.16] P:1300.29 E:0.094892 |  Oh, did he yeah? Yeah, I'm a one trick pony really. Well, I mean I wouldn't you know
[3979.32 - 3985.16] P:1373.22 E:0.089892 |  I'm surprised he's gone there with the amount he's eaten on this trip. So he needs to be careful my roommate
[3986.20 - 3990.68] P:1577.91 E:0.094895 |  My other research tells me you have beef and cheese sandwiches, which sounds absolutely revolting
[3992.04 - 3995.32] P:1307.37 E:0.104418 |  Well, that's all yeah, well, well he I got dumped the other evening
[3995.80 - 4000.44] P:1281.11 E:0.096092 |  By by bruce. He went out with john Murray and and everybody else, but I was working
[4001.00 - 4005.64] P:1441.06 E:0.096183 |  And so I'll bet yeah, I'd beef and cheese sandwiches for two nights on the spin. Pretty nice actually
[4006.60 - 4012.20] P:1491.13 E:0.095168 |  I'll make you one. I'll bring one down one evening. You're absolutely fine. Thanks. I'm I'm okay on that
[4012.52 - 4015.24] P:1526.84 E:0.101330 |  This game has got back on the way. He had whenever you're ready
[4016.52 - 4021.24] P:1575.24 E:0.102056 |  I was ready about 30 odd seconds ago, but I was quite enjoying the fate they look on chris's face when you
[4021.96 - 4027.32] P:1675.27 E:0.094933 |  Took him by surprise talking about the prawn sandwich brigade, but I've got something important to say that we've had a substitution
[4027.72 - 4028.60] P:1501.63 E:0.086224 |  and
[4028.60 - 4030.92] P:1734.04 E:0.102954 |  Tommy yasuo of arsenal has has come on
[4031.48 - 4034.92] P:1669.32 E:0.094991 |  And he has replaced cubo. So it's a defender for a midfielder
[4035.56 - 4041.16] P:1559.46 E:0.086272 |  Gone to they've gone to recenter halfs. You're sent her backs now, haven't they so sake is the right wing back so
[4041.96 - 4043.08] P:1250.77 E:0.059548 |  japan
[4043.08 - 4048.44] P:1646.76 E:0.091380 |  playing from left to right robles shirts white shorts gonder is in goal sake now as the
[4049.00 - 4054.60] P:1515.83 E:0.083231 |  Right wing back with yashida it's akura and tom yasuo as the
[4055.96 - 4057.72] P:1624.17 E:0.093471 |  Three central defenders
[4057.72 - 4060.92] P:1450.29 E:0.095254 |  Utu Naga tomo is now playing as a left wing back
[4061.48 - 4067.88] P:1567.56 E:0.089325 |  Which then leaves tanaka kamata and endo in the midfield with mayada and ito as the two up front
[4067.96 - 4070.84] P:1577.02 E:0.097279 |  Run through the germany side in a moment, but germany are on the attack
[4071.88 - 4075.40] P:1478.51 E:0.107597 |  And the shot coming in is blazed over by
[4076.36 - 4079.24] P:1657.21 E:0.094620 |  Gnabry right hand side of the penalty area
[4079.56 - 4081.32] P:1395.25 E:0.094249 |  He went for glory there
[4081.32 - 4086.52] P:1622.68 E:0.079184 |  So we'll get chris's thoughts on that after i've given you their starting lineup as they play from
[4087.08 - 4091.96] P:1749.83 E:0.085742 |  Right to left with noir in goal back for of sulla rudiger schlotterbeck and round the defense
[4092.60 - 4095.80] P:1769.20 E:0.078840 |  Kimmich and gundo and the goal scorer from the penalty spot in the first half
[4096.36 - 4100.36] P:1674.97 E:0.070897 |  Gnabry muller musyala and havertz chris
[4101.08 - 4103.08] P:1472.53 E:0.080204 |  Yeah, it's almost moody with a
[4103.24 - 4107.56] P:1641.00 E:0.085862 |  Driving run just popped the ball out right to uh, zucanabry
[4108.92 - 4115.40] P:1429.95 E:0.089306 |  Hangle a little bit against him what from 12 14 yards out blaze the ball well over the bar the germans will be thinking
[4115.48 - 4117.48] P:1682.60 E:0.083687 |  Let's get another goal and put this game to bed
[4118.04 - 4123.72] P:1653.27 E:0.064471 |  I don't know all the goalkeeper takes a chance there gonder for japan change of formation
[4124.76 - 4126.36] P:1853.16 E:0.074127 |  change of system
[4126.36 - 4127.72] P:1803.08 E:0.045038 |  I don't know what
[4127.72 - 4131.48] P:1536.97 E:0.083956 |  It is in japanese for park the bus, but that's what they did in the first half
[4131.56 - 4134.44] P:1790.55 E:0.071574 |  They have to show more intent in this second half
[4134.52 - 4139.72] P:1561.91 E:0.080658 |  They really do get support up to daisen mader who's been very very isolated
[4141.56 - 4144.84] P:1647.24 E:0.091514 |  Germany then lead by a golden ill in this the
[4145.80 - 4147.80] P:1978.23 E:0.074131 |  second of four games
[4147.88 - 4149.88] P:1783.45 E:0.059305 |  on what is
[4149.96 - 4151.96] P:1847.79 E:0.062291 |  day four of the

[4161.88 - 4163.16] P:1431.28 E:0.045863 |  japan
[4163.16 - 4167.88] P:1651.21 E:0.067743 |  Play the ball back to uh to gonder the uh the keeper who doesn't look at all
[4168.84 - 4175.16] P:1728.05 E:0.082908 |  Too comfortable that his feet let it run a long way out towards his right hand side before he hoisted it away downfield
[4175.40 - 4180.44] P:1725.83 E:0.087217 |  And I mean that's that's odd in itself. I mean daisen mader isn't the biggest
[4182.36 - 4186.36] P:1600.59 E:0.088520 |  Junior ito isn't the biggest and the ball launched downfield and
[4187.08 - 4189.08] P:1599.13 E:0.068990 |  The german centre halves are going to gobble that up
[4189.96 - 4191.96] P:1531.82 E:0.039821 |  All evening aren't they
[4191.96 - 4195.72] P:1796.90 E:0.080946 |  ball just lifted into the path of gunder one inside the the centre circle
[4196.28 - 4201.40] P:1849.33 E:0.087150 |  And then yashira just steps forward. Does it quite hard and low into the feet of kamada?
[4202.04 - 4205.64] P:1715.73 E:0.086850 |  and japan unable to hold on to the ball once again and
[4206.12 - 4209.00] P:1795.41 E:0.081359 |  Just as we had in the first half as a lot of supporters are still
[4209.72 - 4217.96] P:1799.42 E:0.082584 |  Walking up and down the steps coming back from the gangways taking their seats. It's that subdued atmosphere once again with the exception of that
[4219.00 - 4221.00] P:1948.35 E:0.080068 |  Band of japanese supporters
[4221.64 - 4224.04] P:1820.09 E:0.081010 |  detached away from the rather large
[4225.48 - 4228.28] P:1927.03 E:0.091839 |  bulk of blue on that that far side
[4228.84 - 4231.24] P:1726.22 E:0.087461 |  It was somebody sent a message. It made me laugh
[4231.80 - 4236.60] P:1903.54 E:0.085371 |  On social media was keith escot who said listening to five live sport chris sarton and ian denis
[4237.16 - 4241.56] P:1712.20 E:0.078024 |  On the german and japan game guys the atmosphere is so bad. I hear
[4242.84 - 4245.48] P:1660.25 E:0.098970 |  It's so bad. I can hear what sounds like a bird song
[4247.08 - 4251.64] P:1626.12 E:0.087153 |  I tell you what that could be the next idea for the roommates bill and ben
[4252.60 - 4254.60] P:1769.79 E:0.094586 |  chris sarton and alice to bruce ball for
[4255.24 - 4260.84] P:1690.61 E:0.097254 |  The five live football daily or the world daily well cup daily as the shot comes in on the edge of the area from kamada takes the
[4260.84 - 4264.28] P:1831.73 E:0.078138 |  Delection you could do the birdie song and you're matching pajamas
[4264.28 - 4266.28] P:1785.68 E:0.054097 |  Ha ha ha ha
[4266.52 - 4270.52] P:1569.58 E:0.093039 |  Well, yeah, we'll have to get the alcohol license before we do that
[4271.48 - 4273.48] P:1515.98 E:0.097958 |  uh, but this uh, ito
[4274.36 - 4278.60] P:1707.61 E:0.093694 |  Actually takes a tumbly dives inside the box. He's better than that ito
[4279.56 - 4281.88] P:1783.56 E:0.111854 |  It's simulation world cup simulation
[4283.56 - 4286.68] P:1498.98 E:0.097213 |  I'm calling out for that but try and have a corner
[4287.64 - 4293.56] P:1631.29 E:0.095900 |  I don't I may be wrong. I don't get this though in comes the corner from the far side headed away by moeller
[4293.64 - 4296.12] P:1600.70 E:0.087534 |  They're not the biggest the the Germans have such a
[4296.68 - 4301.88] P:1538.10 E:0.098726 |  height advantage over japan. They haven't tried to work anything short the three corners. I think japan have had
[4303.48 - 4305.48] P:1701.60 E:0.071634 |  A bit of invention
[4306.12 - 4312.92] P:1625.52 E:0.095924 |  Nagatomo heads it away yashida loses the ball it breaks towards gunduan 25 yards out from goal
[4313.48 - 4319.48] P:1609.53 E:0.099933 |  Musiala flicks it along the ground towards round level with a penalty area left hand side musiala always looking
[4319.88 - 4324.04] P:1692.63 E:0.109309 |  With a real threat excellent footwork by musiala what a goal this could be
[4324.60 - 4326.60] P:1615.14 E:0.096042 |  And he couldn't keep it down
[4326.60 - 4329.24] P:1692.70 E:0.117020 |  He jinxed his way in towards the penalty area
[4329.48 - 4333.16] P:1698.00 E:0.101713 |  He weaved away from the challenge and then right footed by the penalty spot
[4333.88 - 4340.68] P:1538.42 E:0.096981 |  He got the conversion. It was over the crossbar one little germany goal kick. Oh, what a goal this would have been
[4342.36 - 4345.88] P:1696.87 E:0.106290 |  It's almost as if the ball is glued to musialas foot
[4346.44 - 4348.92] P:1765.35 E:0.100987 |  Chops inside at first coast pass three four
[4349.64 - 4351.64] P:1554.92 E:0.077057 |  Japanese defenders and
[4351.72 - 4353.48] P:1556.80 E:0.073148 |  needs to show
[4353.48 - 4355.48] P:1694.09 E:0.090929 |  A bit more composure there
[4356.12 - 4359.32] P:1659.12 E:0.100993 |  He ballooned the ball well over the bar when he should have scored
[4360.60 - 4366.20] P:1562.85 E:0.088001 |  12 yards out big opportunity worked the opportunity superbly well for himself
[4368.84 - 4373.40] P:1770.46 E:0.105721 |  Germany's still leading by a goal to nil seven minutes into the uh to the second half
[4374.20 - 4376.52] P:1602.72 E:0.093411 |  Japan certainly don't have happy memories of
[4377.08 - 4380.36] P:1742.50 E:0.096360 |  Qatar they refer to the tragedy of doha
[4380.44 - 4388.68] P:1719.22 E:0.089925 |  That's how many talk about a late two on defeat against iran followed by a two-two draw with with iraq that cost japan a place at the
[4389.08 - 4391.08] P:1634.61 E:0.086988 |  World cup and the 94

[4407.88 - 4410.76] P:1442.47 E:0.095367 |  trailing by golton ill. I I don't know what
[4412.60 - 4414.60] P:1371.88 E:0.086421 |  Brand of football they're trying to play
[4415.48 - 4419.24] P:1600.81 E:0.095051 |  I haven't got any had any real real patterns of play to get up the pitch
[4419.72 - 4422.84] P:1533.16 E:0.087766 |  It's really quite odd. I didn't expect this performance to be
[4423.64 - 4425.64] P:1791.68 E:0.065451 |  this tepid from
[4425.64 - 4427.00] P:1500.26 E:0.047722 |  japan
[4427.00 - 4430.84] P:1652.52 E:0.092570 |  A real combination play and they've got some really good technicians
[4431.64 - 4433.64] P:1564.88 E:0.101791 |  in that midfield we spoke about kamada
[4434.68 - 4437.58] P:1568.41 E:0.099152 |  They played exceptionally well in the bundas league at this season
[4438.28 - 4440.28] P:1339.86 E:0.072244 |  Endos a good player
[4440.76 - 4444.84] P:1513.97 E:0.080311 |  Tanaka comfortable on the ball, but they haven't been willing to play
[4445.96 - 4447.96] P:1661.83 E:0.087529 |  Japan are coming forward now
[4448.12 - 4454.12] P:1746.40 E:0.094970 |  Kamada forces the ball out to sakai on this near side back towards kamada side onto goal

[4467.88 - 4472.36] P:1647.77 E:0.085914 |  Yes, it does they uh actually worked the ball pretty well into the box and
[4473.88 - 4475.88] P:1607.19 E:0.066393 |  The decent cross from
[4476.04 - 4478.04] P:1523.14 E:0.058789 |  Tanaka, but
[4478.04 - 4479.32] P:1666.07 E:0.044100 |  just
[4479.32 - 4482.68] P:1732.78 E:0.098338 |  Not able to hook the ball back across the six yard box, but
[4483.24 - 4485.24] P:1516.52 E:0.086309 |  Are we finally seeing japan

[4507.24 - 4508.28] P:1648.17 E:0.073790 |  because
[4508.28 - 4513.40] P:1551.05 E:0.099130 |  I've now got the birdie song in my head every time I can hear the the person who's uh, who's whistling
[4518.28 - 4520.28] P:1718.10 E:0.086130 |  Germany won japan nil
[4521.32 - 4522.60] P:1711.10 E:0.076156 |  They finished

[4525.56 - 4531.80] P:1586.91 E:0.090654 |  But we saw the intensity and the energy of Saudi Arabia against argentina offside against kamada
[4532.60 - 4534.60] P:1566.32 E:0.088002 |  And that really has been lacking
[4535.96 - 4537.40] P:1482.92 E:0.067223 |  From japan
[4537.40 - 4541.32] P:1679.08 E:0.096446 |  Yeah, it's it look as I said, um, you know in the first half
[4541.40 - 4547.40] P:1694.66 E:0.095401 |  It's okay. You sit you you set up you have a game plan, but the goal changes everything kamada there really that's a good line from
[4548.60 - 4550.60] P:1454.60 E:0.096151 |  The german line kamada makes his run

[4552.76 - 4554.76] P:1596.36 E:0.083151 |  But maybe we're just seeing
[4555.64 - 4557.64] P:1743.74 E:0.088966 |  The signs of change now
[4557.64 - 4560.92] P:1563.72 E:0.091383 |  Japan pressing the germans higher up the pitch trying to win the ball
[4561.56 - 4564.84] P:1601.62 E:0.094512 |  Higher up the pitch but it runs the risk of the germans playing through them
[4565.32 - 4567.80] P:1624.31 E:0.093898 |  Well they're coming forward now and they're looking threatening and round

[4582.12 - 4586.20] P:1670.20 E:0.079893 |  Too early, but I don't mind that you know japan pressing
[4587.64 - 4591.72] P:1662.58 E:0.082333 |  The germans high up the pitch havertz was actually on side there. That was a poor decision
[4592.68 - 4598.84] P:1709.44 E:0.081186 |  The assistant waited and waited gonda just gets there before havertz, but that would have been an opportunity for the germans
[4601.88 - 4605.24] P:1715.09 E:0.065488 |  That's the voice of chris satan on bbc radio five live
[4606.92 - 4610.04] P:1614.91 E:0.061389 |  musyala back to rudiger in the

[4635.08 - 4642.04] P:1628.72 E:0.077300 |  As there's a blow to the head there of musyala and that will mean there is a stoppage in play and japan are going to make
[4642.92 - 4644.92] P:1865.75 E:0.082388 |  another change so we've already seen
[4645.00 - 4650.76] P:1678.21 E:0.042691 |  Tomi yasu come on at at halftime for japan

[4659.48 - 4663.88] P:1643.89 E:0.066215 |  Has had a little bit of illness. That's the reason why maybe didn't start the game. So he's going to be coming on
[4664.28 - 4667.32] P:1760.67 E:0.072678 |  And also we're going to be seeing asano. So these are
[4668.52 - 4670.04] P:1658.67 E:0.030451 |  Two
[4670.04 - 4672.04] P:1915.24 E:0.091475 |  positive changes
[4672.04 - 4674.04] P:1748.30 E:0.067110 |  that are being made
[4674.12 - 4676.44] P:1736.88 E:0.101094 |  Nagatomo is the player who is going to be coming off
[4677.08 - 4682.76] P:1567.83 E:0.097661 |  And meida is the other player who is going to be coming off. So asano will go on in place of meida the Celtic player
[4683.40 - 4685.40] P:1314.31 E:0.076225 |  and then i would imagine that
[4687.40 - 4689.40] P:1576.64 E:0.082299 |  Brighton's caru metoma
[4690.68 - 4694.68] P:1415.80 E:0.096012 |  Will fill in on that left hand side as a as a left wing back
[4695.96 - 4700.52] P:1645.98 E:0.104339 |  But changes that need to happen to try and produce something and straight away asano
[4700.92 - 4708.04] P:1655.63 E:0.101601 |  Involved out towards ito right hand side a good cross into asano throws himself at it near side of the six yard box

[4711.16 - 4716.28] P:1686.69 E:0.096177 |  Yeah, lively start from asano just pops it out wide and there's a good early cross in
[4717.16 - 4719.88] P:1423.11 E:0.096720 |  Asano had made his run beyond the near post
[4720.84 - 4726.84] P:1549.24 E:0.083669 |  Never with the point of the six yard box and couldn't get his head up on target, but this is better from japan
[4727.40 - 4729.40] P:1482.80 E:0.058323 |  Not letting the germans
[4730.60 - 4735.48] P:1492.30 E:0.084655 |  Have it all the wrong way really pressing them high up the pitch not backing off
[4737.08 - 4741.72] P:1679.31 E:0.056860 |  Surprised they didn't take this tactic in the first half
[4743.96 - 4747.64] P:1593.05 E:0.099538 |  So he has gone over on there hasn't it is like for like for metoma to replace
[4748.28 - 4750.44] P:1749.60 E:0.086460 |  Nagatomo is the the left wing back

[4844.12 - 4846.12] P:1789.93 E:0.107693 |  Yeah, but it's really good build-up play
[4847.56 - 4850.28] P:1755.02 E:0.106956 |  He drifts superbly gun douan. Do you know what he should score?
[4852.12 - 4854.76] P:1786.20 E:0.103876 |  The wonderful touch into his path and he's just trying to
[4856.84 - 4862.76] P:1687.23 E:0.088514 |  Slip the ball inside gondas far post and the ball cannons off the left hand post and wide
[4863.72 - 4866.44] P:1737.40 E:0.084783 |  And the germans should be out of sight

[4887.40 - 4891.72] P:1718.73 E:0.109031 |  Looking now towards metoma who's got a bit of space you run into and all of a sudden it's three against four
[4891.80 - 4896.36] P:1802.59 E:0.099688 |  Germany do have the but it's three against three now and it's now with asano who shoots
[4896.92 - 4901.88] P:1704.46 E:0.092681 |  And noia watches the ball go across his goal and well off target and out for a goal kick
[4902.44 - 4907.08] P:1687.86 E:0.090671 |  Never look comfortable. That's a big chance for japan and that's all it takes
[4907.96 - 4910.20] P:1621.20 E:0.098279 |  Isn't it the germans only one up?
[4911.32 - 4917.40] P:1626.92 E:0.094614 |  metoma pops the ball out left hand side of the box. It's a it's a decent enough first touch from asano, but
[4918.44 - 4920.44] P:1751.41 E:0.088244 |  Just leans back
[4921.16 - 4923.56] P:1735.36 E:0.109092 |  Got to work noia in that situation
[4924.44 - 4926.44] P:1494.63 E:0.071023 |  Gotta hit the target

[4941.24 - 4947.72] P:1631.70 E:0.094445 |  To get a little bit of that wouldn't say a foothold. It's a toe in the game maybe for uh japan. Yeah, but this may suit germany

[4956.44 - 4959.72] P:1718.92 E:0.096929 |  But japan have to take a risk they need to get back into the game and
[4961.64 - 4966.44] P:1775.94 E:0.093533 |  Yeah, they may feel that they can hurt this german team if the germans aren't clinical
[4969.00 - 4975.16] P:1751.84 E:0.092253 |  Well asano has got a little bit of a little bit of pace musyala just caught by it's a kura
[4975.24 - 4980.60] P:1628.19 E:0.086394 |  That'll be a free kick. We haven't had a yellow card in the uh contest so far and the salvo d'orion referee
[4980.60 - 4984.36] P:1650.25 E:0.082000 |  Ivan Barton will not show one on this occasion. It's just a friendly

[4988.36 - 4990.86] P:1629.28 E:0.077649 |  So clever isn't he musyala?

[4995.88 - 5001.40] P:1560.25 E:0.079156 |  You'll see it's easy to kura coming to try and nick the ball off him in front of him. Let's run across his body
[5002.44 - 5004.44] P:1541.11 E:0.065726 |  Takes it on the back foot draws the foul
[5005.72 - 5007.16] P:1576.28 E:0.008534 |  So

[5012.04 - 5016.44] P:1731.63 E:0.084492 |  Almost coming to a standstill now gun douan. So there's no pressure on the ball whatsoever from japan
[5016.44 - 5018.44] P:1476.71 E:0.089920 |  I've got every player back behind the ball
[5018.84 - 5024.76] P:1751.42 E:0.083431 |  Towards rudiger short diagonal ball to gun douan kimmick and then played back to schlotterbeck
[5025.24 - 5028.84] P:1740.68 E:0.087846 |  And as christ mentioned at times it looks like they are playing with three central defenders
[5028.84 - 5033.08] P:1478.04 E:0.088198 |  That's going to be offside against havers terrible run from havers. I mean blindish
[5034.04 - 5039.80] P:1589.50 E:0.075609 |  Goes so early just needs to bend his run a little bit more
[5041.80 - 5043.80] P:1649.20 E:0.045958 |  It's not
[5043.80 - 5048.84] P:1521.93 E:0.091369 |  It's not a natural in that number nine position. It's a bit of a problem area
[5050.36 - 5052.36] P:1711.55 E:0.042213 |  Well, the german team
[5052.60 - 5054.12] P:1613.11 E:0.013660 |  had some

[5105.72 - 5109.80] P:1724.70 E:0.088881 |  And snuffed out the danger. He had been a doubt. He hadn't played

[5122.76 - 5129.40] P:1876.94 E:0.093692 |  Is rapid and certainly he showed his pace there, but rudiger was equal to it. Germany's still lead by a goal to nil

[5159.80 - 5161.80] P:1851.28 E:0.054191 |  Jonas hoffman
[5161.80 - 5163.80] P:1731.24 E:0.071430 |  Who's gonna be coming on back?
[5164.92 - 5166.92] P:1598.96 E:0.023747 |  That's right
[5167.56 - 5169.56] P:1514.57 E:0.025693 |  He uh
[5170.36 - 5173.96] P:1704.34 E:0.042072 |  Will be coming on to the field of play
[5174.60 - 5181.88] P:1557.72 E:0.084254 |  Complain defense or midfield Jonas hoffman. So the german supporters on the far side who are now trying to whip up another mexican way
[5183.48 - 5186.52] P:1640.66 E:0.086077 |  But uh, I've just been so disappointed with japan
[5187.88 - 5194.44] P:1598.88 E:0.087326 |  They might still get something from the game. There's 25 minutes remaining. Let's see what happens trailing by a goal to nil sakai
[5195.08 - 5197.08] P:1401.39 E:0.059460 |  plays it back
[5197.56 - 5200.04] P:1591.57 E:0.085169 |  Because it's a central area mitomo
[5201.56 - 5203.56] P:1349.68 E:0.072454 |  Now with tenaka
[5203.88 - 5205.88] P:1394.07 E:0.071345 |  tomiyasu
[5205.88 - 5211.56] P:1770.70 E:0.102316 |  Along the ground asano turn shoots gets a corner kick as well better. Yeah, you said about
[5212.20 - 5217.88] P:1671.38 E:0.091552 |  Japan getting a foothold in this game. They're taking the game to germany
[5219.80 - 5222.12] P:1712.53 E:0.110741 |  Feel their confidence may just be growing
[5223.32 - 5225.32] P:1656.29 E:0.101838 |  You need to try and create something clear cup
[5225.32 - 5230.04] P:1733.95 E:0.090667 |  I don't get this. They have to play it short. They may score
[5231.24 - 5233.24] P:1669.13 E:0.090390 |  direct from a header, but
[5233.96 - 5235.96] P:1867.00 E:0.073188 |  the germans are
[5236.04 - 5238.04] P:1607.39 E:0.082000 |  Just so much bigger
[5238.12 - 5245.08] P:1675.56 E:0.095568 |  Corner kick for japan swung over deep and the header from it's a kura at the far side of the penalty area
[5245.16 - 5249.96] P:1612.75 E:0.093278 |  It was unmarked and it was headed away by schlotterbeck pulled in behind musyala, didn't he?
[5250.92 - 5257.08] P:1511.43 E:0.085965 |  He's hit to beyond the the far post and musyala not not looking at the ball
[5257.88 - 5262.52] P:1716.89 E:0.098267 |  Just looking at it's a kura. It's a kura tries to go back across does the right thing, but it was
[5263.72 - 5265.40] P:1747.56 E:0.068082 |  schlotterbeck
[5265.40 - 5267.40] P:1583.64 E:0.090037 |  Slotting that header away
[5268.04 - 5271.72] P:1774.80 E:0.101283 |  Well, you talked before about the german center forwards who've gone before
[5273.48 - 5278.04] P:1606.79 E:0.096054 |  Uh miraslav closer the famous geert moeller jürgen klinsmann. They've scored
[5279.96 - 5286.84] P:1586.57 E:0.102094 |  Only more goals than thomas moeller for germanic world cup finals, but moeller unable to add to his tally of 10
[5287.64 - 5292.04] P:1362.83 E:0.095456 |  So he has come off to be replaced by urus hoffman
[5293.96 - 5298.04] P:1749.01 E:0.096012 |  And then the other change is gundogan like for like really
[5299.24 - 5301.24] P:1628.25 E:0.091496 |  gundogan being replaced
[5301.72 - 5303.72] P:1352.69 E:0.075871 |  by gretzka
[5304.28 - 5308.84] P:1563.08 E:0.091408 |  By munich in the the midfield so two changes made by germany
[5309.48 - 5315.08] P:1552.20 E:0.089047 |  And we're midway through the second half here on bbc radio five live and bbc sounds
[5316.84 - 5320.68] P:1634.23 E:0.092845 |  And it's still germany leading through that gundogan first half penalty
[5320.76 - 5324.12] P:1688.89 E:0.097371 |  remember by the way as well when you're watching games on bbc television
[5325.00 - 5327.40] P:1629.38 E:0.100694 |  I mean five live and bbc sounds have every game
[5328.28 - 5332.28] P:1636.65 E:0.087215 |  But when it's on bbc tv you can watch and listen
[5332.84 - 5338.76] P:1628.83 E:0.087398 |  With a five live commentary you just have to look out for the world cup extra on the bbc i player
[5338.92 - 5340.92] P:1553.39 E:0.061191 |  It gives you that option
[5342.12 - 5345.64] P:1781.91 E:0.078949 |  Yeah, gretzka's just slotted in behind kymik
[5346.04 - 5349.40] P:1811.48 E:0.115372 |  Sakai's head forward asano in towards the penalty area
[5349.96 - 5356.60] P:1723.44 E:0.100192 |  Took it first time tightly marked by rudiger comes behind him asano has made a difference since he's come onto the field of play
[5356.60 - 5357.40] P:1758.77 E:0.095558 |  kornikin kajipan
[5357.40 - 5359.48] P:1587.82 E:0.095510 |  He has made a difference, but you've got to say
[5360.12 - 5363.88] P:1650.64 E:0.096832 |  The japanese have been much better in this second half this own shown
[5364.60 - 5367.32] P:1543.06 E:0.113451 |  more intent and rudiger does really well, but
[5368.84 - 5375.48] P:1738.83 E:0.097305 |  Ball headed from sakai into asano angle against him rudiger stands up and makes the block but
[5376.20 - 5378.20] P:1625.99 E:0.079278 |  confidence growing
[5379.16 - 5382.68] P:1874.31 E:0.108237 |  Tachi kamada with a corner kick it's an out swing the right hand side
[5383.32 - 5386.36] P:1791.16 E:0.102456 |  It's akura was there once again and it's scooped up by
[5387.24 - 5389.24] P:1487.34 E:0.054583 |  noia
[5389.24 - 5395.24] P:1704.78 E:0.097552 |  Just wouldn't really drop towards the central defender as it's rolled out underarm towards sulla
[5396.20 - 5401.96] P:1758.76 E:0.079451 |  And he trots forward and still at a walking pace with kymik to schlotterbeck
[5403.08 - 5406.52] P:1716.48 E:0.097467 |  Still don't feel that germany have really got out of first gear throughout this game
[5407.80 - 5410.28] P:1595.17 E:0.087946 |  No, but you said before they want that
[5411.40 - 5416.60] P:1783.27 E:0.088619 |  Second goal they've had pretty much control of this game. You can see the japanese pushing
[5417.64 - 5418.92] P:1522.08 E:0.054957 |  now and
[5418.92 - 5421.24] P:1593.07 E:0.102887 |  Really getting off to germany middle of the park
[5425.72 - 5434.04] P:1694.78 E:0.093166 |  2018 was only the second time in germany's illustrious world cup history that they had
[5439.64 - 5441.64] P:1783.99 E:0.088371 |  Not reach the quarterfinals
[5442.28 - 5446.44] P:1696.12 E:0.081031 |  1938 was the other occasion. This is their 20th
[5447.24 - 5451.96] P:1815.08 E:0.091340 |  World cup appearance only the second team to reach such a landmark after brazil
[5455.96 - 5458.28] P:1644.44 E:0.094367 |  They are serial challenges
[5458.92 - 5460.28] P:1706.13 E:0.080470 |  musy ala
[5460.28 - 5465.32] P:1760.08 E:0.103269 |  Central position kymik with a chip over ganabri with a layoff good save by the goalkeeper
[5466.44 - 5468.44] P:1791.15 E:0.080364 |  To keep out hoffman
[5468.44 - 5473.32] P:1753.62 E:0.106436 |  Still the german threat remains ganabri shot curling beaten away by gondor once more
[5474.12 - 5476.76] P:1764.55 E:0.107081 |  musy ala now picks it up left hand side round
[5477.24 - 5480.44] P:1683.64 E:0.109308 |  Runs forward down towards the byline with the cross in the area
[5480.68 - 5484.84] P:1728.61 E:0.113991 |  Gondor again with a save from ganabri and a second save from gondor
[5485.88 - 5494.44] P:1746.25 E:0.109486 |  And can every can't believe it great work by gondor golden work by gondor goal kick corner kick great work by gondor
[5496.04 - 5500.84] P:1735.69 E:0.099066 |  Great four saves in quick succession. It's a brilliant ball from kymik
[5501.24 - 5506.84] P:1627.61 E:0.105916 |  Initially ganabri really unselfish pops the ball back to hoffman gondor down to his left hand side
[5507.32 - 5511.64] P:1687.40 E:0.111455 |  Then they recycle the ball gondor again down to his right hand side this time
[5512.60 - 5517.00] P:1637.14 E:0.097631 |  Ball comes out musy ala pops at a wide round with the crossing
[5518.04 - 5523.88] P:1578.64 E:0.099747 |  Powerful header left hand side again big left hand and then he body on the line
[5524.60 - 5528.12] P:1675.61 E:0.103449 |  No crucial could those saves be from gondor the great
[5528.68 - 5530.68] P:1504.83 E:0.086377 |  I thought you were going to say gondor the wonder
[5531.56 - 5536.68] P:1698.51 E:0.106181 |  Corner kick for germany. He needs to be alert still leading by a golden ill right hand side
[5537.08 - 5541.72] P:1482.38 E:0.094790 |  Over the head of schlotterbeck over the head of rudiger and out it goes
[5542.68 - 5547.24] P:1744.60 E:0.103349 |  Full eighth row to germany on this near side. There is activity on the
[5548.68 - 5550.68] P:1578.90 E:0.105898 |  Japan bench down below
[5551.64 - 5557.64] P:1695.80 E:0.090047 |  They still have two more opportunities to make further changes does their coach mori asu
[5558.68 - 5562.84] P:1629.29 E:0.090046 |  As it's with round back it goes to to schlotterbeck
[5563.56 - 5565.56] P:1305.85 E:0.028463 |  I
[5565.88 - 5571.96] P:1646.36 E:0.089671 |  Said last night. I mean I'm sick and tired of the amount of these substitutions. That's really hard work. Isn't it being a
[5573.00 - 5580.60] P:1705.93 E:0.070953 |  Well co commentator the hard work comes when they then add on about 13 minutes as a result of three substitutions
[5583.88 - 5585.88] P:1672.19 E:0.105778 |  Germany still lead by a golden ill
[5586.76 - 5588.76] P:1603.27 E:0.104650 |  We have 18 minutes remaining
[5589.00 - 5590.60] P:1685.94 E:0.089292 |  There we go
[5590.60 - 5592.76] P:1636.95 E:0.110053 |  They're livening up the japanese team now
[5594.12 - 5596.12] P:1762.34 E:0.100974 |  Must be a foul from goretska
[5598.36 - 5600.68] P:1728.58 E:0.111059 |  I think there was talk wasn't it before the game about
[5601.32 - 5608.28] P:1704.94 E:0.084352 |  Gunduin ended up with the goal past gonder but goretska whether it be goretska or gunduin
[5611.24 - 5617.80] P:1601.64 E:0.099552 |  Doan came on to replace tenaka in the midfield so yet it's another player who plays in uh in germany
[5617.96 - 5621.32] P:1624.09 E:0.102436 |  24 year old normie plays on the right for uh for fryberg
[5622.36 - 5627.24] P:1728.88 E:0.099339 |  Who've actually done well there were second in the bundesliga before the the world cup break
[5628.04 - 5633.16] P:1732.47 E:0.092476 |  So they've made a number of changes now to try and get this equalizer in the second half
[5634.12 - 5640.68] P:1755.22 E:0.112107 |  Here is the endo forward opportunity for japan watch a save from goretska and then it comes out
[5641.80 - 5643.80] P:1610.15 E:0.105207 |  And I think it might have been
[5643.88 - 5647.08] P:1771.33 E:0.113230 |  Was it tom yasser who's put it over the top from close range?
[5647.64 - 5654.60] P:1794.56 E:0.103946 |  What a save from noya the concentration levels must be so great. He's had nothing to do throughout the game
[5654.92 - 5656.92] P:1635.23 E:0.091702 |  It's a one-handed save
[5657.40 - 5659.56] P:1815.82 E:0.111885 |  But the loose ball should have been buried
[5660.20 - 5662.20] P:1489.60 E:0.093321 |  Well, it's a brilliant save
[5663.00 - 5664.36] P:1547.81 E:0.064903 |  It was sakai
[5664.36 - 5668.84] P:1807.82 E:0.103221 |  Yeah sakai, but it's the initial save actually takes a deflection
[5669.72 - 5673.08] P:1663.60 E:0.085563 |  Of rudegas left foot and then sakai
[5674.36 - 5676.36] P:1413.29 E:0.048836 |  I think
[5676.76 - 5683.72] P:1647.26 E:0.101381 |  Osana's in his way maybe but sakai should have buried that balloons of all over the bar
[5683.80 - 5688.04] P:1707.40 E:0.092551 |  That was the chance that japan needed and they didn't take it
[5689.80 - 5692.20] P:1647.23 E:0.113591 |  Can they carve out another opportunity?
[5693.72 - 5695.72] P:1730.98 E:0.101178 |  You just wonder if there's going to be
[5696.44 - 5702.92] P:1721.02 E:0.096539 |  A dramatic finish here to the caliph or international stadium when you think of the heroics the double save
[5703.56 - 5708.28] P:1721.17 E:0.091522 |  From suichi gonder at one end and then japan still being in the contest
[5708.76 - 5712.28] P:1727.07 E:0.086983 |  So this is going to be their final change that they they can make
[5713.24 - 5715.24] P:1458.25 E:0.059713 |  for japan
[5715.24 - 5720.52] P:1562.75 E:0.086584 |  And it is minamino the former Liverpool player who has come on
[5722.60 - 5727.48] P:1493.38 E:0.099049 |  And it is sakai who has gone off he had been playing as a right wing back
[5727.56 - 5730.20] P:1619.18 E:0.095834 |  He had that golden chance to get the equalizer
[5730.92 - 5737.00] P:1753.67 E:0.097581 |  And he will be ruined that missed opportunity. He's been consoled as he makes his way to the bench. What if
[5737.72 - 5739.72] P:1517.63 E:0.052010 |  What if
[5740.04 - 5743.16] P:1853.74 E:0.100800 |  Hiroki sakai had scored from close range there
[5743.96 - 5749.48] P:1797.58 E:0.097404 |  So ito who temporarily moved to the left is back to the right try to play in dohan block. All of a sudden now
[5749.88 - 5751.88] P:1588.21 E:0.072830 |  japan are starting
[5752.44 - 5754.12] P:1448.00 E:0.062666 |  to
[5754.12 - 5756.84] P:1779.16 E:0.089304 |  Have a few options as an attacking team
[5757.56 - 5763.48] P:1826.44 E:0.104993 |  Matoma left hand side runs forward edge of the area minamino is there good save
[5766.52 - 5770.92] P:1747.26 E:0.119652 |  Japan have got the equalizer it's a substitute dohan
[5773.08 - 5777.32] P:1745.46 E:0.118648 |  And there is the twist in the tail with 15 minutes remaining
[5777.96 - 5779.96] P:1760.65 E:0.117750 |  It's the substitute who combined
[5780.68 - 5786.52] P:1794.86 E:0.116280 |  And ritsu dohan who plays in football in germany has equalized against germany
[5787.00 - 5788.52] P:1593.84 E:0.099138 |  one one
[5788.52 - 5791.80] P:1690.12 E:0.124190 |  And what have we learned in the last few minutes japan can play
[5792.44 - 5797.88] P:1699.42 E:0.112182 |  Brave on the ball becoming desperate the longer the game has gone on taking risks
[5798.68 - 5802.92] P:1561.72 E:0.116938 |  Played the way beautifully up the pitch worked it down the left hand side brilliantly
[5803.48 - 5805.48] P:1619.31 E:0.073502 |  The
[5806.04 - 5808.04] P:1673.32 E:0.080867 |  Noia
[5808.12 - 5810.12] P:1718.81 E:0.123892 |  Makes a decent save initially
[5811.48 - 5813.48] P:1633.22 E:0.096801 |  With his left hand, but
[5813.48 - 5817.72] P:1795.94 E:0.112147 |  With the save he pushes it out into an area and dohan is so alone
[5819.08 - 5821.48] P:1789.14 E:0.120441 |  He can't really miss but he's proactive
[5822.60 - 5828.84] P:1740.54 E:0.111929 |  Falls for him six seven yards out just lifts the ball into the roof of the net japan level japan back in it
[5829.64 - 5831.64] P:1680.17 E:0.081698 |  japan can play
[5832.36 - 5834.36] P:1584.09 E:0.085003 |  Well, certainly
[5834.36 - 5837.96] P:1901.24 E:0.114302 |  Moriatsu the coach has been vindicated with the changes that he's made
