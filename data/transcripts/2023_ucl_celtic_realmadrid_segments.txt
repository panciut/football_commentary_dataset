[0.00 - 3.20] P:1958.74 E:0.049920 |  The noise has been absolutely incredible.
[3.20 - 7.96] P:1977.56 E:0.049569 |  Here we go, whistle blows, Sandro Scherer, Swiss referee gets us under way.
[7.96 - 12.00] P:2003.49 E:0.050433 |  Celtic pressing immediately, not the best back pass from David Alaba.
[12.00 - 15.64] P:2022.93 E:0.046418 |  Few nerves maybe, caught to our quickly out to the edge of the area
[15.64 - 18.04] P:1905.96 E:0.041757 |  and clears it away for a Celtic throw.
[18.04 - 22.92] P:1946.82 E:0.043100 |  Chelsea beaten in the 5-45 kickoff against Dino Mote at Zagreb this evening.
[22.92 - 26.68] P:1993.26 E:0.050285 |  Early chance for Celtic, Abadah just wide with his right foot,
[26.68 - 29.32] P:1994.72 E:0.050205 |  took a deflection, goes behind for a corner.
[29.32 - 31.04] P:2003.55 E:0.049933 |  Celtic are on it straight away.
[31.04 - 32.56] P:1858.88 E:0.055656 |  That's an incredible start.
[32.56 - 34.76] P:1927.10 E:0.044044 |  Look, they're going to take the corner quick as well.
[34.76 - 36.44] P:1978.12 E:0.051405 |  First of all, Jack and Marcus pressing,
[36.44 - 38.68] P:1895.31 E:0.045756 |  Cortoine to the throw in, they throw it quick.
[38.68 - 41.80] P:1891.25 E:0.051758 |  Nice little interplay between Jack and Marcus, Abadah gets his shot away
[41.80 - 43.92] P:1915.35 E:0.043018 |  and it's deflected, dream start for Celtic.
[43.92 - 47.52] P:1837.10 E:0.046145 |  I know it's early, but that's exactly how they would have wanted to start the game.
[47.52 - 50.72] P:1935.32 E:0.045553 |  It's what they do, domestic, it's what they did to Rangers on Saturday
[50.72 - 54.08] P:1850.15 E:0.042062 |  in the 4-0 win, too quick, too sharp, inventive,
[54.08 - 56.32] P:1906.40 E:0.048436 |  but so precise with it as well.
[56.32 - 62.40] P:1936.47 E:0.044200 |  And Postacoglu said, opportunities like this come around very few times in a lifetime.
[62.40 - 66.48] P:1941.73 E:0.043399 |  Why limit yourself? Why stop doing what you've done to get here?
[66.48 - 70.28] P:1939.05 E:0.051125 |  That's what Celtic are going to do tonight and they've won themselves another corner.
[70.28 - 74.40] P:1966.90 E:0.043633 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, Bedlam inside the stadium.
[74.40 - 77.16] P:1788.04 E:0.050609 |  And on the flip side of that, it comes out, this recie,
[77.16 - 79.64] P:1691.46 E:0.047534 |  click back, it goes back to Jens, comes into McGregor,
[79.64 - 82.72] P:1861.04 E:0.047605 |  it's round the corner, it's out to Taylor.
[82.72 - 84.72] P:1773.80 E:0.054825 |  All the way, Real Madrid, they're putting pressure on,
[84.72 - 86.48] P:1834.27 E:0.041876 |  it just can't get near the minute.
[86.48 - 89.32] P:1806.81 E:0.044430 |  Minute and a half played in the game, corner comes into the penalty,
[89.32 - 93.44] P:1888.66 E:0.047672 |  nearly fell to a barter again, just rolls gently into the arms of Thibault Courtois,
[93.44 - 97.68] P:1900.87 E:0.043491 |  off a couple of deflections, so his 10-outfield teammates all in black.
[97.68 - 102.04] P:1867.72 E:0.044805 |  Thibault Courtois in sort of cherry red this evening, away to our right-hand side.
[102.04 - 105.56] P:1910.86 E:0.044995 |  Borussia Dortmund have beaten FC Coburn, Hagen by three goals for Niel.
[105.56 - 109.80] P:1864.52 E:0.048216 |  Chelsea beaten, one nil, away to Dino Mosa, Grev,
[109.80 - 111.96] P:1938.51 E:0.046839 |  they're at home to Red Bull Salzburg next week,
[112.00 - 114.64] P:1805.73 E:0.046184 |  they've already a bit of pressure on that fixture for them,
[114.64 - 117.80] P:1752.39 E:0.046802 |  and as we were hearing England's women already three goals for the good
[117.80 - 120.08] P:1834.79 E:0.042822 |  against Luxembourg in the World Cup qualified,
[120.08 - 124.28] P:1908.76 E:0.042348 |  commentary continues over on five, sports extra, a barter,
[124.28 - 126.80] P:1884.94 E:0.045569 |  two goals against Rangers for the young Israeli on the weekend,
[126.80 - 128.92] P:1910.51 E:0.043600 |  plays it into Matto Reilly, good first touch,
[128.92 - 131.68] P:1790.22 E:0.045523 |  Modric darts in to win the ball back for Madrid,
[131.68 - 133.80] P:1927.80 E:0.050019 |  they try and play out inside their own half,
[133.80 - 136.72] P:2077.92 E:0.048431 |  as soon as they get possession, you hear the cheers and the whistles,
[136.72 - 141.88] P:2089.65 E:0.047500 |  and Venetius Jr., the scorer of the winning goal against Liverpool in Paris in May,
[141.92 - 143.60] P:2019.98 E:0.044443 |  flicks it back to Courtois,
[143.60 - 147.48] P:2014.01 E:0.047217 |  Real Madrid will not be hassled, they will not be harried,
[147.48 - 149.48] P:2010.67 E:0.038914 |  they're going to take their time.
[149.48 - 150.84] P:2000.77 E:0.048632 |  Yeah, of course they will.
[150.84 - 156.32] P:1974.50 E:0.048670 |  Huge experience side, top level players within the top team,
[156.32 - 160.56] P:1859.73 E:0.054084 |  and they know how to win games, they know how to deal with teams at press,
[160.56 - 163.48] P:1821.34 E:0.050504 |  and teams at trying, no force mistakes, you see them now,
[163.48 - 166.48] P:1930.62 E:0.039851 |  they're just not in the ball about almost,
[166.48 - 169.44] P:1900.73 E:0.048182 |  go and sell to continue making that break,
[169.48 - 171.68] P:1844.22 E:0.048571 |  so they can go and exploit that, you know,
[171.68 - 175.76] P:1752.10 E:0.048457 |  hugely experienced side, they will not be fazed by the start that Celtic have had.
[175.76 - 177.52] P:1762.66 E:0.041389 |  Great build up from Real Madrid from the back,
[177.52 - 178.92] P:1833.98 E:0.043909 |  two of them, and he's balling to Modric,
[178.92 - 181.12] P:1928.27 E:0.046632 |  quickly flicked on to Valverde on the right-hand side,
[181.12 - 182.72] P:1886.73 E:0.042508 |  Benzema making ground in the middle,
[182.72 - 184.68] P:1958.03 E:0.045977 |  Carter Vickers has it covered, comes in,
[184.68 - 187.28] P:1927.53 E:0.042213 |  bollies it away with his left foot over the head of Jota,
[187.28 - 189.24] P:1934.45 E:0.044901 |  he leaps to try and win the head of Carvajal,
[189.24 - 192.60] P:1881.91 E:0.047604 |  is back there, Celtic might win this on the halfway line,
[192.60 - 195.92] P:1952.99 E:0.039849 |  try and build again, Jota couldn't quite find,
[195.96 - 198.60] P:1942.14 E:0.049646 |  Jack O'Mack is Matto Riley, the 21-year-old,
[198.60 - 201.56] P:2044.61 E:0.042223 |  comes hurtling forward to press Courtois,
[201.56 - 204.00] P:1850.40 E:0.048946 |  Alibar under pressure, but Real Madrid very cool,
[204.00 - 207.72] P:1801.97 E:0.037444 |  he quickly passing, played out from the back and fell on Mendy,
[207.72 - 210.68] P:1786.63 E:0.043518 |  the left back has Venetius Jr. running towards him,
[210.68 - 212.36] P:1881.02 E:0.045493 |  tries to flick the ball beyond Yuranovic,
[212.36 - 213.52] P:1809.69 E:0.044296 |  gets lucky with the rebound,
[213.52 - 215.64] P:1952.75 E:0.044936 |  Venetius Jr. on the way, moving at speed,
[215.64 - 218.16] P:1975.39 E:0.041697 |  Yuranovic gets a foot in, half stops him,
[218.16 - 220.92] P:1934.97 E:0.047883 |  Venetius Jr. again and then Yuranovic is a bit rash,
[220.92 - 223.80] P:1908.60 E:0.039879 |  comes through the back of him and concedes an early free kick.
[224.56 - 227.56] P:1815.13 E:0.048595 |  Really rash, absolutely spot on Ali by Yuranovic,
[227.56 - 229.88] P:1890.26 E:0.045462 |  he gets down initially, does well to get back,
[229.88 - 233.32] P:1790.75 E:0.046461 |  Carter Vickers comes over and covers and forces him back the way
[233.32 - 237.40] P:1859.08 E:0.045985 |  towards the sideline, Yuranovic doesn't have to make the challenge
[237.40 - 240.16] P:1869.77 E:0.044003 |  and now they have to go and defend this way free kick.
[240.16 - 243.16] P:1998.17 E:0.045102 |  Venetius Jr. on the halfway line, tried that turn that he did
[243.16 - 245.60] P:1761.77 E:0.044345 |  on Fernandinho against Manchester City last season,
[245.60 - 248.00] P:1786.33 E:0.046234 |  if you remember, got away and scored the goal,
[248.00 - 251.12] P:1894.07 E:0.041969 |  and Yuranovic you could see, you could almost feel the panic from here,
[251.12 - 252.32] P:1799.94 E:0.049469 |  he felt he had to deal with it,
[252.32 - 256.00] P:2008.28 E:0.044380 |  well he's conceded the free kick, four minutes gone at Celtic Park,
[256.00 - 259.60] P:1895.64 E:0.049538 |  Sevilla Manchester City underway, as far as I'm aware that's still 0-0,
[259.60 - 263.52] P:1800.38 E:0.041319 |  Conor McNamara will continue to bring us updates of that one,
[263.52 - 267.40] P:1712.89 E:0.045811 |  Celtic-Nil Real Madrid-Nil and the referee,
[267.40 - 272.80] P:1806.40 E:0.042988 |  Sandro Scherer, just making his presence felt before this free kick,
[272.80 - 276.88] P:1849.47 E:0.041867 |  he's bringing young Moritz Jens, the German centre back for Celtic,
[276.88 - 282.28] P:1785.81 E:0.040425 |  out from the middle, as well as I think Edair Milletow,
[282.28 - 284.48] P:1891.04 E:0.038387 |  Real Madrid's Brazilian centre back,
[284.48 - 287.60] P:1916.16 E:0.042342 |  they were having a bit of two and throw, pushing and shoving,
[287.60 - 291.44] P:1911.19 E:0.044236 |  Jens marking him at the far post, free kick taken by Crows,
[291.44 - 296.04] P:1983.89 E:0.042832 |  it's driven deep, Valverde takes a touch, kills a cross in towards Alaba,
[296.04 - 298.68] P:1963.29 E:0.041204 |  headed away, aborted with a second header,
[298.68 - 303.16] P:1893.08 E:0.038863 |  and there's the little graceful Elfin figure of Luca Modric,
[303.16 - 307.32] P:1955.95 E:0.045497 |  controls it, plays the pass and Real Madrid come back into their own half.
[307.32 - 309.56] P:2028.48 E:0.049174 |  So Celtic got Johart in goal,
[309.60 - 314.48] P:1983.68 E:0.039259 |  Yeranovich, Carter Jens and Greg Taylor are back four,
[314.48 - 317.88] P:1913.78 E:0.037434 |  Callum McGregor, the skipper at the base of midfield,
[317.88 - 321.52] P:1826.63 E:0.042270 |  Matto Riley and Rio Hattate either side of him,
[321.52 - 326.52] P:1931.22 E:0.044851 |  Lille Labarda and Jota are the wingers with Georgios Jacomakis
[326.52 - 329.08] P:1902.82 E:0.045587 |  as the centre forward, Keogos on the bench,
[329.08 - 332.48] P:1894.58 E:0.042143 |  Sevilla against Manchester City underway, here's Conor McNamara.
[332.48 - 335.32] P:1947.83 E:0.048594 |  Yeah, it's still Sevilla-Nil, Manchester City-Nil,
[335.32 - 337.40] P:1995.83 E:0.041121 |  we've played exactly six with it,
[337.44 - 339.84] P:1851.95 E:0.046791 |  Erling Hallens had a touch and he didn't score with it,
[339.84 - 343.40] P:1906.11 E:0.043203 |  which the way he's been playing lately feels like worth pointing out.
[343.40 - 346.56] P:1982.96 E:0.047725 |  The city centre forward waiting for more service to come his way,
[346.56 - 348.88] P:1892.46 E:0.049401 |  but it's mostly defending city of attitude so far,
[348.88 - 350.64] P:1917.28 E:0.040932 |  Papu Gomez has looked good for Sevilla,
[350.64 - 352.60] P:1916.13 E:0.048180 |  it's Sevilla-Nil, Manchester City-Nil.
[352.60 - 354.40] P:1967.11 E:0.037249 |  Best pass of the night from Rio Hattate,
[354.40 - 356.44] P:1935.46 E:0.048356 |  has found Jota wide on the left-hand side,
[356.44 - 359.32] P:1806.61 E:0.041619 |  couldn't find Greg Taylor on the overlapping run,
[359.32 - 362.32] P:1817.63 E:0.043404 |  Real Madrid have the ball back inside their own half,
[362.32 - 364.56] P:1964.74 E:0.041750 |  Modric, little shoulder shake from him,
[364.56 - 366.80] P:1905.20 E:0.039266 |  he can't flip with the outside of his right foot,
[366.80 - 369.80] P:1862.80 E:0.045391 |  plays it across his penalty area to the Austrian international,
[369.80 - 372.80] P:1896.69 E:0.043790 |  David Alaba, fell on Mendy the left back,
[372.80 - 375.64] P:1949.85 E:0.046204 |  back to Courtois inside his own six-yard box,
[375.64 - 379.12] P:1881.37 E:0.046450 |  Millet-Tow, side footed pass out to the right-hand side,
[379.12 - 382.44] P:1794.06 E:0.045228 |  and Real Madrid are able just to release that pressure
[382.44 - 385.00] P:1909.26 E:0.049182 |  and bring the ball forward to the halfway line.
[385.00 - 388.48] P:1819.07 E:0.043227 |  Paris Saint-Germain have scored early on against Juventus,
[388.48 - 393.60] P:1671.85 E:0.041359 |  PSG won Juventus nearly one of the eight-o-clock kick-offs this evening.
[393.64 - 396.72] P:1779.05 E:0.048164 |  Listen to our commentary tonight, by the way, here at Celtic Park,
[396.72 - 399.56] P:1918.65 E:0.047960 |  alongside the final score graphics and the video-printer,
[399.56 - 403.48] P:1801.95 E:0.040071 |  you can do that via the BBC iPlayer, the red button and the BBC Sport app,
[403.48 - 406.04] P:1886.78 E:0.041451 |  just click on five-live final score,
[406.04 - 409.20] P:1882.77 E:0.039770 |  and Bapé with the goal for Paris Saint-Germain.
[409.20 - 411.84] P:1753.89 E:0.041656 |  So we're watching Benzema, Harlan's in action tonight,
[411.84 - 413.64] P:1820.51 E:0.045589 |  and Bapé has scored.
[413.64 - 416.72] P:1989.14 E:0.043972 |  The Champions League is back with a bang, as the Celtic fans were saying.
[416.72 - 421.32] P:1932.47 E:0.041230 |  Celtic and Rangers both a part of it, commentary on Rangers in Amsterdam tomorrow,
[421.36 - 424.00] P:1925.40 E:0.043087 |  a way to Ajax at 5.45.
[424.00 - 427.64] P:1953.14 E:0.043430 |  A lot of patient Real Madrid build-up at the moment.
[427.64 - 430.76] P:1925.42 E:0.043935 |  I'll give you their full-team lineup when we get our next break in play.
[430.76 - 432.76] P:1835.33 E:0.041896 |  More thoughts from James McFadden as well,
[432.76 - 436.36] P:1880.72 E:0.040078 |  who was with Rangers a couple of weeks ago in the Netherlands,
[436.36 - 438.92] P:1795.06 E:0.045767 |  and watched them beat PSV Eindhoven by a goal to an ill
[438.92 - 440.32] P:1881.68 E:0.039231 |  to make it into the group stages,
[440.32 - 442.12] P:1924.66 E:0.045409 |  crossing to the edge of the box here,
[442.12 - 445.24] P:1835.14 E:0.041065 |  header away from Jens, Jota with a second header,
[445.24 - 447.80] P:1827.83 E:0.042206 |  Modric is there, just leaps up in the air,
[447.80 - 450.84] P:1884.40 E:0.043326 |  cushions the pass down the right to Carvajal.
[450.84 - 453.72] P:1907.61 E:0.044249 |  Back to Modric, first-time ball does reach Tony Crows.
[453.72 - 455.80] P:1876.14 E:0.043041 |  Not sure that was the intended target,
[455.80 - 457.96] P:1824.15 E:0.043247 |  Real Madrid having a lot of early possession games.
[457.96 - 461.60] P:1686.45 E:0.043141 |  Yeah, as you would expect, they're not going to be phased,
[461.60 - 464.80] P:1859.07 E:0.040940 |  although the atmosphere has been absolutely terrific.
[464.80 - 466.80] P:1850.07 E:0.047967 |  They will not be phased by the atmosphere,
[466.80 - 469.76] P:1884.22 E:0.048658 |  they won't be phased by the fact that Celtic are going to try
[469.76 - 471.16] P:1791.43 E:0.049107 |  and put them under pressure,
[471.16 - 473.92] P:1948.54 E:0.050095 |  and the actual fact, Celtic are just dropping off
[473.92 - 476.80] P:1900.51 E:0.045844 |  and maybe looking to pick the moments to go and press
[476.80 - 478.92] P:1787.63 E:0.047733 |  and put Real Madrid under pressure, but they won't be phased.
[479.00 - 481.44] P:1862.76 E:0.051501 |  There are too many good players, too many top-top players,
[481.44 - 484.20] P:1831.78 E:0.049130 |  comfortable with the ball, even if they're in trouble.
[484.20 - 486.36] P:1766.63 E:0.055200 |  You've seen it early, Vinicius had nothing on,
[486.36 - 488.72] P:1762.36 E:0.045651 |  he clicks it back to Courtois, they go out the other side
[488.72 - 490.08] P:1683.37 E:0.047559 |  and they get that break.
[490.08 - 491.88] P:1761.75 E:0.045582 |  So, yeah, they will be patient,
[491.88 - 493.72] P:1576.64 E:0.047183 |  and it's something that Celtic are going to have to deal with,
[493.72 - 495.32] P:1786.62 E:0.042890 |  because not a lot of teams, certainly,
[495.32 - 497.72] P:1635.36 E:0.034833 |  domestically will do that to Celtic.
[497.72 - 500.36] P:1879.60 E:0.037344 |  It's the fascinating, really fascinating thing about this evening.
[500.36 - 502.28] P:1804.26 E:0.041797 |  Celtic so rampant at the start of this season,
[502.28 - 505.08] P:1898.01 E:0.046261 |  domestically 29-goals scored, just the two conceded,
[505.08 - 506.80] P:1794.64 E:0.035339 |  both against Ross County,
[506.80 - 509.48] P:1824.26 E:0.041360 |  and how will it translate to the European stage?
[509.48 - 511.84] P:1910.03 E:0.041672 |  It didn't last season, that was a different Celtic team.
[511.84 - 513.92] P:1835.64 E:0.046252 |  Labour Cousin were 4-0 winners here,
[513.92 - 516.60] P:1910.80 E:0.046649 |  Bodo Glimp knocked them out of the Europa Conference League
[516.60 - 518.16] P:1877.76 E:0.046809 |  on a disappointing night for Celtic.
[518.16 - 521.16] P:1858.68 E:0.046890 |  Vinicius Jr. has gone down easily, claiming he was whacked in the face.
[521.16 - 525.16] P:1939.27 E:0.045207 |  Celtic on the high press, Alaba plays it quickly back to Courtois.
[525.16 - 528.08] P:2025.35 E:0.044725 |  Courtois, again getting the wolf whistles from the fans,
[528.08 - 530.52] P:1855.93 E:0.043493 |  sweeps it away with his left foot, fell on Mendy.
[530.52 - 533.72] P:1954.83 E:0.046180 |  Now, that was an elbow, it looked like, in the face of Jack Amakis,
[533.72 - 536.72] P:1916.43 E:0.046484 |  and the referee blows his whistle, and then with the finger,
[536.92 - 539.44] P:1872.71 E:0.042587 |  just beckons Mendy towards him.
[539.44 - 543.32] P:1885.45 E:0.039067 |  I think Carlo Ancelotti, James, is complaining about the previous one,
[543.32 - 544.80] P:1892.67 E:0.044867 |  they felt on Vinicius Jr.
[544.80 - 547.32] P:1852.77 E:0.052085 |  Yeah, Colin McGregor has stepped across Vinicius,
[547.32 - 549.84] P:1785.85 E:0.046159 |  and he goes down, the referee was right in the spot,
[549.84 - 552.52] P:1734.99 E:0.045981 |  decides not to give it, and that one with Mendy,
[552.52 - 555.24] P:1785.09 E:0.042234 |  he is running up the line, he puts his arm out,
[555.24 - 558.48] P:1834.40 E:0.042393 |  almost defends Jack Amakis off, he doesn't swing it,
[558.48 - 560.76] P:1800.98 E:0.045767 |  but it catches him in the face with the arm,
[560.76 - 561.92] P:1771.28 E:0.050896 |  right in front of the referee,
[561.92 - 563.56] P:1831.19 E:0.045707 |  fourth official is down there as well,
[563.56 - 565.60] P:1882.54 E:0.037058 |  I think it's a correct decision, and...
[565.64 - 568.52] P:1793.06 E:0.047528 |  Carlo Ancelotti is obviously going to be claiming for that, of course.
[568.52 - 572.32] P:1848.17 E:0.040715 |  He looks on with one eyebrow raised,
[572.32 - 574.36] P:1724.34 E:0.042427 |  that will not surprise you to hear that,
[574.36 - 576.88] P:1820.93 E:0.042330 |  being there, seeing it done it, has Carlo Ancelotti.
[576.88 - 580.44] P:1872.60 E:0.043680 |  Gary Flint has seen another goal for England's women against Luxembourg, Gary.
[580.44 - 583.92] P:1741.03 E:0.050114 |  Yep, 4-0, Rachel Daly, far post, clever header down,
[583.92 - 586.68] P:1707.49 E:0.044345 |  pass the keeper, England 4, Luxembourg 0.
[586.68 - 590.84] P:1887.90 E:0.041477 |  Contrary over on Radio 5, Sports Extra, Mendy got the yellow card,
[590.84 - 592.48] P:1868.42 E:0.045304 |  he's on the ball now for Real Madrid,
[592.48 - 594.24] P:1952.42 E:0.041837 |  plays it up to the edge of the Celtic box,
[594.24 - 596.92] P:1880.69 E:0.046270 |  Carter Vickers was able to step in in front of Benzema,
[596.92 - 599.92] P:1905.50 E:0.041685 |  who has so often plays with that right wrist,
[599.92 - 601.72] P:1856.96 E:0.035958 |  strapped in the white bandage,
[601.72 - 605.20] P:1955.39 E:0.044818 |  jotted chest the ball down on the halfway line for Celtic,
[605.20 - 607.00] P:1970.23 E:0.045952 |  so they're in the green and white hoops,
[607.00 - 608.92] P:1933.47 E:0.044006 |  white shorts, hoops socks,
[608.92 - 612.88] P:1883.78 E:0.045842 |  playing from left to right towards the Lisbon Lion stand in this first half.
[612.88 - 617.32] P:1898.04 E:0.040789 |  Yuranovic urged on by the fans, plays it to Matto Riley,
[617.32 - 619.88] P:1933.71 E:0.046578 |  tries to give it back to him, it goes through Yuranovic's legs,
[619.88 - 621.52] P:1736.30 E:0.048601 |  here's a barter on the right-hand side
[621.56 - 624.56] P:1734.20 E:0.039093 |  to try and keep the momentum going for Celtic.
[624.56 - 626.64] P:1629.11 E:0.045394 |  Callan McGregor plays a little 1-2 with Greg Taylor,
[626.64 - 628.96] P:1908.69 E:0.052532 |  slides the pass forward, a Riley into a Tarte,
[628.96 - 632.52] P:1939.44 E:0.048398 |  nearly finds Jackamac, his alabar is there to clear for Real Madrid,
[632.52 - 635.68] P:1914.20 E:0.045889 |  that is exactly what Celtic try and do to their opponents,
[635.68 - 637.44] P:1982.01 E:0.036032 |  it very nearly came off.
[637.44 - 639.52] P:1669.40 E:0.056354 |  Very nearly, dad, but now they have to go and defend,
[639.52 - 641.64] P:1805.39 E:0.042435 |  the nice and speed of Real Madrid's counter.
[641.64 - 644.08] P:1866.71 E:0.045641 |  Venetius Jr. now looking for the 1-2 with Benzema,
[644.08 - 646.88] P:1874.43 E:0.045977 |  gets it back to Venetius Jr., inside the penalty area,
[646.88 - 649.76] P:1877.13 E:0.043606 |  7 yards up from the byline, crossed to the back post,
[649.80 - 651.40] P:1849.01 E:0.047885 |  Benzema tries to hit the left foot volley,
[651.40 - 653.64] P:1912.02 E:0.047310 |  Modric with the left foot volley, that's blocked,
[653.64 - 657.48] P:1952.75 E:0.039979 |  comes back to Venetius Jr., takes one touch,
[657.48 - 659.52] P:1890.96 E:0.046908 |  and he's going to have a little run at Yuranovic,
[659.52 - 662.08] P:1945.76 E:0.045041 |  tries to take Yuranovic on the inside,
[662.08 - 663.88] P:1923.44 E:0.049558 |  Celtic win the ball back with a barter,
[663.88 - 666.28] P:1886.73 E:0.042606 |  a barter thinks about dribbling out of the penalty area,
[666.28 - 667.88] P:1876.19 E:0.046576 |  Modric closes him down,
[667.88 - 670.28] P:1897.27 E:0.042463 |  Real Madrid just starting to suffocate Celtic
[670.28 - 673.28] P:1963.60 E:0.043955 |  at this point in the game, 11 minutes gone in the first half,
[673.28 - 676.56] P:2000.33 E:0.046304 |  Tua Meneze, 30 yards out, plays it across to Valverde
[676.56 - 680.44] P:2038.91 E:0.044692 |  in a central position, Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil,
[681.84 - 685.52] P:2107.48 E:0.045759 |  live from inside Celtic Park, you can listen to us
[685.52 - 689.00] P:2006.71 E:0.045728 |  on five live, also available on the BBC Sounds app tonight,
[689.00 - 691.20] P:1922.40 E:0.045976 |  Tua Meneze, little diagonal ball into the edge
[691.20 - 693.96] P:1961.01 E:0.041189 |  of the Celtic box, cleared on the volley,
[693.96 - 696.44] P:1945.19 E:0.048553 |  only as far as Mende on the right hand side,
[696.44 - 699.24] P:1856.27 E:0.040847 |  here's Tony Kroos, Kroos to Modric,
[699.24 - 703.40] P:1841.75 E:0.039716 |  Kroos curling pass out to the left to Mende,
[703.40 - 705.32] P:1772.34 E:0.045710 |  Celtic with defending to do at the moment,
[705.36 - 708.76] P:1805.40 E:0.042662 |  Modric is on the ball in the inside left channel,
[708.76 - 710.72] P:1709.53 E:0.052630 |  teases one inside to Benzema,
[710.72 - 712.80] P:1862.76 E:0.047340 |  Benzema gets the back heel from Venetius Junior,
[712.80 - 715.92] P:1989.78 E:0.046351 |  Yuranovic slides in, clears it behind for a corner,
[715.92 - 718.04] P:1926.37 E:0.040053 |  Gary Flint off, seeing another England goal, Gary.
[718.04 - 720.20] P:1832.85 E:0.050032 |  Yep, five nil, Beth Mead with the snake hips,
[720.20 - 722.48] P:1821.19 E:0.052783 |  pass to the defenders, slotted past the goalkeeper,
[722.48 - 724.96] P:1952.48 E:0.038965 |  England five, Luxembourg nil.
[724.96 - 727.00] P:2032.03 E:0.047064 |  Dino Mosa, grab one, Chelsea nil a result
[727.00 - 728.32] P:2032.73 E:0.039923 |  in the Champions League this evening,
[728.32 - 731.80] P:1993.84 E:0.045746 |  PSG one up on Juventus, Borussia Dortmund beat FC Copenhagen
[731.80 - 734.12] P:2000.04 E:0.046941 |  by three goals to nil, Real Madrid have a corner here
[734.16 - 738.44] P:1948.26 E:0.035970 |  at Celtic Park, it's Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil,
[738.44 - 742.72] P:1973.35 E:0.041711 |  Tony Kroos pauses, takes a breath, jogs towards the ball,
[742.72 - 745.84] P:1948.82 E:0.045499 |  high curling one to the far post, foul in there,
[745.84 - 748.52] P:1962.07 E:0.045085 |  tug on the shirt, Celtic take the free kick quickly,
[748.52 - 750.72] P:1921.33 E:0.047646 |  of course they do, and here they come on the counter,
[750.72 - 752.72] P:1867.55 E:0.041697 |  Abaddon in eight, there's a space on the right hand side,
[752.72 - 755.24] P:1939.82 E:0.053556 |  Jota tries to phone in, he might have done it as well,
[755.24 - 757.08] P:1998.03 E:0.052098 |  Abaddon with the right foot shot,
[757.08 - 759.24] P:1951.11 E:0.048857 |  hits it straight to Courtois, what a chance,
[759.24 - 760.08] P:1933.65 E:0.043047 |  James McFadden.
[760.08 - 762.84] P:1914.88 E:0.057125 |  Oh, it's a huge chance, and you're absolutely spot on,
[763.44 - 765.88] P:1749.57 E:0.050472 |  I'll come back to you, because Real Madrid are countering again.
[765.88 - 768.28] P:1895.42 E:0.048776 |  Incredible stuff, end to end, we thought it might be,
[768.28 - 771.76] P:1934.38 E:0.039145 |  Venetius Jr, couple of step-overs, here's Benzema,
[771.76 - 773.32] P:1959.85 E:0.047894 |  head to the Celtic penalty area,
[773.32 - 775.32] P:1891.98 E:0.041944 |  looking for that curler into the top corner,
[775.32 - 777.32] P:1999.61 E:0.041578 |  closed down quickly, so couldn't hit the shot,
[777.32 - 781.12] P:1978.04 E:0.040430 |  back it comes to Modric, Modric side-foot's a little ball,
[781.12 - 783.08] P:2043.20 E:0.043561 |  to the young French international, Tua Mane,
[783.08 - 787.24] P:1905.54 E:0.048002 |  back to Modric, he'll be 37, on Friday he's over-hit the pass,
[787.24 - 791.48] P:1949.95 E:0.037978 |  very unlike him, Carvajal can't control it, James.
[791.48 - 795.72] P:1824.78 E:0.047762 |  Yes, Wells, the corner come in, referee blow for a free kick,
[795.72 - 798.76] P:1811.05 E:0.050593 |  Celtic as they do, played it quick, Matt O'Reilly's breaking,
[798.76 - 801.32] P:1737.58 E:0.051285 |  just up the left-hand side, and it's easy for us to see,
[801.32 - 803.76] P:1704.95 E:0.052718 |  we can see if he reverses it, Abaddon's in,
[803.76 - 807.04] P:1795.20 E:0.050342 |  he chooses to go to Jota, who could obviously see Abaddon,
[807.04 - 809.64] P:1876.23 E:0.049454 |  he plays a ball just inside the shoulder,
[809.64 - 813.24] P:1927.85 E:0.052534 |  of Ferram Mende, and Abaddon's shot is just tamish,
[813.24 - 814.96] P:1833.08 E:0.046662 |  he doesn't catch it.
[814.96 - 817.04] P:1800.77 E:0.047071 |  That noise means Celtic pouring forward,
[817.04 - 818.64] P:1866.32 E:0.047690 |  Abaddon's got that run, unfortunately,
[818.68 - 821.96] P:1892.39 E:0.047478 |  Yuranovic passed it out to the right, Abaddon side-footed it,
[821.96 - 824.40] P:1931.65 E:0.042574 |  I think he was looking for the cross to Jaco Macus,
[824.40 - 826.88] P:1832.66 E:0.047584 |  and he slightly sliced it into the side netting.
[826.88 - 830.08] P:1853.57 E:0.052514 |  Yeah, again, it's good play, Celtic breaking at speed,
[830.08 - 833.20] P:1812.28 E:0.056372 |  Yuranovic's just waiting for his moment to play Abaddon,
[833.20 - 835.44] P:1782.88 E:0.054795 |  he's got O'Reilly, he's got Jaco Macus,
[835.44 - 838.88] P:1836.91 E:0.048868 |  he has Jota in the box, I think he's just trying to bend
[838.88 - 842.16] P:1670.34 E:0.052406 |  that last line of defence, he just gets it all wrong,
[842.16 - 844.44] P:1748.55 E:0.046773 |  comes off the inside, he's footing it to the side net,
[844.44 - 846.68] P:1809.24 E:0.046046 |  and it's a couple of times now where he's had opportunities,
[846.72 - 849.52] P:1988.11 E:0.043996 |  particularly with that shot that I just spoke about,
[849.52 - 852.20] P:1991.01 E:0.046026 |  had a chance to maybe take a touch,
[852.20 - 854.76] P:1948.09 E:0.045691 |  and it looked like he tried to go for power
[854.76 - 856.96] P:1805.75 E:0.044270 |  and just didn't get it, and then that one there,
[856.96 - 859.92] P:1902.49 E:0.041406 |  it's a great opportunity for Celtic to put a ball across,
[859.92 - 862.80] P:1855.94 E:0.049223 |  the trademark move, if you like, and he just gets it wrong,
[862.80 - 865.00] P:1855.03 E:0.045714 |  but still encouraging them getting these opportunities.
[865.00 - 866.88] P:2009.31 E:0.048833 |  Celtic have made a good start to this game,
[866.88 - 868.52] P:1759.72 E:0.045910 |  they've won the ball back off Real Madrid,
[868.52 - 870.84] P:1906.12 E:0.049355 |  inside the Real Madrid half, looking for a free kick,
[870.84 - 873.36] P:1946.03 E:0.047089 |  for the challenge on Jota, O'Reilly gets the ball,
[873.36 - 876.52] P:1877.14 E:0.041669 |  advantage possibly played, not going to come back for the free kick,
[876.52 - 879.96] P:1858.63 E:0.048142 |  Shouimani is able to bring it away for the European champions,
[879.96 - 883.32] P:1843.05 E:0.042972 |  Vinicius Jr. He's in the mood this evening,
[883.32 - 886.68] P:1859.26 E:0.044818 |  Francis Arana, Yuranovic again, this time stops in his tracks,
[886.68 - 890.32] P:1784.90 E:0.045735 |  plays it in field to Shouimani, now clips one forward,
[890.32 - 892.48] P:1990.27 E:0.039712 |  Katowice reads it brilliantly,
[892.48 - 894.24] P:1806.45 E:0.048424 |  Benzema was making the run behind him,
[894.24 - 896.96] P:1817.27 E:0.041800 |  Celtic have the ball back inside their own half,
[896.96 - 900.56] P:1796.05 E:0.044205 |  15 minutes gone, Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil,
[900.56 - 902.76] P:1879.14 E:0.045216 |  Celtic look confident, Jokes, don't they?
[902.76 - 905.68] P:1751.57 E:0.055379 |  Yeah, they do, in the game, I know we're really early on,
[905.72 - 907.48] P:1716.30 E:0.044761 |  it has lived up to what we expected,
[907.48 - 910.56] P:1785.84 E:0.047522 |  Celtic are trying to attack, of course it's not all out attack,
[910.56 - 912.84] P:1718.59 E:0.047251 |  they're trying to put pressure on at the right moment,
[912.84 - 916.40] P:1704.18 E:0.043582 |  in Real Madrid, when they break, the pace at the break-up,
[916.40 - 919.96] P:1610.35 E:0.050404 |  is phenomenal, they've got so much control when they win the ball back,
[919.96 - 922.48] P:1745.75 E:0.045121 |  but you look at Celtic now, they're just knocking the ball about,
[922.48 - 925.56] P:1710.65 E:0.047092 |  they're waiting for the opportunity, and how they build up,
[925.56 - 928.76] P:1817.05 E:0.042585 |  as the two centre-backs split the width of the 18,
[928.76 - 931.52] P:1790.07 E:0.050174 |  Kallon McGregor drops, you've got the two full-backs that join in,
[931.52 - 933.84] P:1529.71 E:0.044558 |  and then Hatati Noreilly,
[933.84 - 935.84] P:1743.62 E:0.050292 |  join in with the front three of Obada,
[935.84 - 939.16] P:1879.07 E:0.043061 |  Jackamac is in Jota, trying to entice that press,
[939.16 - 942.24] P:1821.07 E:0.044039 |  so they can then change the tempo and turn that into an attack.
[942.24 - 943.68] P:1950.91 E:0.050524 |  Yuranovic looking for Jackamac,
[943.68 - 945.64] P:1932.71 E:0.055516 |  it goes down inside the penalty area,
[945.64 - 948.08] P:1831.39 E:0.047362 |  Eddair Militão was wrestling with him,
[948.08 - 950.40] P:1892.04 E:0.043344 |  referee had a good view of it,
[950.40 - 953.16] P:1914.86 E:0.049816 |  probably six or one and a half a dozen of the other Celtic fans
[953.16 - 955.32] P:1893.21 E:0.051981 |  don't like the decision, and then fell on Mendy,
[955.32 - 957.52] P:1854.80 E:0.049240 |  sort of bought a free kick down by the byline,
[957.52 - 959.60] P:1866.14 E:0.043825 |  he waited for the challenge from Matt O'Reilly,
[959.60 - 962.84] P:1795.38 E:0.038706 |  who came gently into the back of him, down he went,
[962.84 - 965.08] P:1819.02 E:0.044035 |  and Real Madrid will have a chance to clear their lives,
[965.08 - 966.52] P:1685.82 E:0.042804 |  that wasn't a penalty, was it?
[966.52 - 969.52] P:1518.44 E:0.052130 |  I would like to see it again, but there is a bit of wrestling going on,
[969.52 - 972.72] P:1707.67 E:0.043967 |  I think you're right, it's six or one and a half a dozen of the other,
[972.72 - 975.60] P:1708.61 E:0.046706 |  and Jackamac is, you always look at the players' reaction,
[975.60 - 978.48] P:1761.70 E:0.045653 |  he does go down, he's straight back up to put pressure on,
[978.48 - 980.48] P:1716.04 E:0.046186 |  he obviously didn't feel it was a penalty,
[980.48 - 983.84] P:1632.54 E:0.046117 |  and he just got on with it, but that was again Celtic just knocking the ball
[983.84 - 985.64] P:1737.05 E:0.042570 |  about waiting for that opportunity,
[985.64 - 987.64] P:1698.26 E:0.049558 |  and then it's put round the corner to Jackamac,
[987.64 - 989.68] P:1563.94 E:0.048707 |  who will be a handful because of his work rate,
[989.68 - 991.44] P:1864.06 E:0.037090 |  because of his physicality,
[991.44 - 993.88] P:1850.89 E:0.052703 |  and they just can't keep it alive on that occasion.
[993.88 - 996.60] P:2028.89 E:0.039691 |  Real Madrid taking an age actually to take this free kick,
[996.60 - 997.88] P:1973.63 E:0.040619 |  Alaba chips it forward,
[997.88 - 1000.00] P:1899.82 E:0.050044 |  Tua Mane heads it towards the half-way line,
[1000.00 - 1001.48] P:1915.38 E:0.041002 |  absolutely no-one there,
[1001.48 - 1006.56] P:1804.11 E:0.037907 |  and Ancelotti just throws his arms up in disgust at that,
[1006.56 - 1007.96] P:1952.57 E:0.043585 |  Celtic have the ball back again,
[1007.96 - 1010.80] P:1902.93 E:0.042461 |  don't forget Real Madrid did actually lose four games
[1010.80 - 1014.32] P:1903.45 E:0.044600 |  in the Champions League last season on the way to winning the title,
[1014.32 - 1018.72] P:1924.48 E:0.045219 |  one of those at home to Sherif Tirisfal in the group stages,
[1018.76 - 1023.00] P:1777.03 E:0.044232 |  also lost to PSG Chelsea in Manchester City
[1023.00 - 1025.24] P:1661.25 E:0.046249 |  in the knockout stages,
[1025.24 - 1029.00] P:1704.41 E:0.044839 |  RB Leipzig 1-0 down against Shakhtar in this group,
[1029.00 - 1031.64] P:1671.55 E:0.040098 |  cross into the Real Madrid penalty area,
[1031.64 - 1032.56] P:1675.42 E:0.050150 |  headed away,
[1032.56 - 1036.28] P:1964.80 E:0.048953 |  Carvajal is well forward for the visitors,
[1036.28 - 1038.16] P:1905.90 E:0.047832 |  but Celtic have enough bodies to win it back,
[1038.16 - 1041.56] P:1784.72 E:0.045846 |  Calan McGregor plays a little 1-2 with Río Hatate,
[1041.56 - 1044.76] P:1884.86 E:0.039270 |  brilliant to have the Champions League group stages,
[1044.76 - 1046.80] P:1767.15 E:0.044237 |  back on five live in BBC sounds,
[1046.80 - 1048.96] P:1754.76 E:0.047730 |  two more commentaries coming your way tomorrow,
[1048.96 - 1051.92] P:1647.45 E:0.041970 |  Ajax against Rangers kicks off at 5.45,
[1051.92 - 1053.72] P:1661.54 E:0.045394 |  Napoli against Liverpool,
[1053.72 - 1055.52] P:1955.82 E:0.051769 |  our commentary at 8 o'clock,
[1055.52 - 1059.08] P:1842.86 E:0.044229 |  Mark Chapman presenting from Huffpast 5 tomorrow afternoon,
[1059.08 - 1062.44] P:1770.07 E:0.042592 |  and John Murray will be at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium
[1062.44 - 1065.84] P:1816.92 E:0.040611 |  to bring you updates at Tottenham against Marseille.
[1065.84 - 1068.80] P:1879.67 E:0.044009 |  England against Luxembourg has reached half-time
[1068.80 - 1070.44] P:1963.71 E:0.049335 |  in the women's World Cup qualifier,
[1070.44 - 1073.60] P:1896.99 E:0.045402 |  will bring you details on that after this Celtic attack,
[1073.60 - 1076.56] P:1862.21 E:0.050146 |  Hatate has put it between Jotar and Abadda,
[1076.60 - 1077.72] P:1923.24 E:0.046285 |  neither could get to it,
[1077.72 - 1080.24] P:1831.69 E:0.042633 |  caught off his line, here's Gary Clinton.
[1080.24 - 1082.72] P:1804.97 E:0.054228 |  Yep, England five up at the break, Ali,
[1082.72 - 1084.88] P:1715.09 E:0.052516 |  two for Stanway, one each for Rousseau,
[1084.88 - 1087.76] P:1841.61 E:0.046595 |  Daly and Mead, expect some experimentation
[1087.76 - 1089.48] P:1689.93 E:0.046061 |  in the second half from Serena Begwin,
[1089.48 - 1091.48] P:1685.86 E:0.041094 |  England five, Luxembourg now.
[1091.48 - 1093.44] P:1861.02 E:0.035316 |  Celtic, Niel Rehm, Madrid, Niel,
[1093.44 - 1095.76] P:1743.20 E:0.046961 |  talking about those two commentaries tomorrow,
[1095.76 - 1097.28] P:1825.42 E:0.040656 |  tomorrow morning first thing,
[1097.28 - 1100.72] P:1796.75 E:0.041904 |  later on tonight as well, on the BBC sounds app,
[1100.72 - 1103.60] P:1881.02 E:0.043712 |  the Champions League of Waydays podcast return,
[1103.60 - 1106.52] P:1798.48 E:0.039521 |  so our teams in Amsterdam and Naples
[1106.52 - 1109.48] P:1792.15 E:0.047721 |  will bring you previews of those two big ties
[1109.48 - 1111.36] P:1733.24 E:0.042058 |  ahead of the commentaries tomorrow.
[1111.36 - 1114.12] P:1801.45 E:0.040915 |  Niel Niel here at Celtic Park in the company of
[1114.12 - 1116.00] P:1831.92 E:0.043454 |  James McFadden and Roddy Forsythe,
[1116.00 - 1120.60] P:1831.47 E:0.037416 |  Real Madrid, building down the right with Danny Carvajal,
[1120.60 - 1122.60] P:1937.57 E:0.046598 |  he's got support from Valverde,
[1122.60 - 1125.40] P:1960.74 E:0.039977 |  Modric comes tiptoeing across back to Carvajal,
[1125.40 - 1128.16] P:1926.39 E:0.043508 |  Valverde makes a run infield with the ball at his feet,
[1128.16 - 1133.04] P:1950.57 E:0.038603 |  outside of his right foot, lovely clip pass to Mendy
[1133.08 - 1136.48] P:1925.33 E:0.045809 |  on the left, level with the edge of the Celtic penalty area,
[1136.48 - 1138.12] P:1987.52 E:0.039595 |  David Alaba takes a touch,
[1138.12 - 1140.52] P:1884.77 E:0.044262 |  high cross into the back post towards Benzema,
[1140.52 - 1142.16] P:1933.14 E:0.046228 |  can't reach him, it'll stay in place,
[1142.16 - 1143.72] P:1879.45 E:0.040514 |  so Greg Taylor's got to deal with it,
[1143.72 - 1145.48] P:1940.37 E:0.049080 |  drives it forward on the half volley,
[1145.48 - 1148.72] P:1902.80 E:0.043194 |  suddenly it's one on one between Militão and Jakim Macis,
[1148.72 - 1151.60] P:1835.16 E:0.049143 |  Militão wins the header, has to chase his own header
[1151.60 - 1153.76] P:1904.42 E:0.050295 |  back to the byline, then on the turn,
[1153.76 - 1155.64] P:1939.26 E:0.052686 |  clears it out for a Celtic throw,
[1155.64 - 1157.52] P:1956.12 E:0.048962 |  and I think Celtic are going to take that James
[1157.52 - 1159.80] P:1957.78 E:0.044896 |  extremely quickly, they do, jotter,
[1159.80 - 1162.40] P:1808.50 E:0.052632 |  looking for O'Reilly, could have found Obada in the middle,
[1162.44 - 1164.76] P:1968.77 E:0.052063 |  but instead the ball has gone behind for a corner,
[1164.76 - 1165.76] P:2004.90 E:0.047811 |  James McFarrum.
[1165.76 - 1169.20] P:1847.69 E:0.051390 |  That is almost identical to the goal they scored at the weekend,
[1169.20 - 1171.68] P:1896.70 E:0.050843 |  quick throw in, there's O'Reilly's shoulder,
[1171.68 - 1174.72] P:1838.22 E:0.043029 |  he hits it first time, almost goes to Obada,
[1174.72 - 1177.36] P:1658.21 E:0.050072 |  and that is what Celtic do, they just get the ball in play
[1177.36 - 1179.64] P:1825.30 E:0.043440 |  as soon as they can, put bodies forward,
[1179.64 - 1181.60] P:1823.82 E:0.034332 |  and put you under pressure.
[1181.60 - 1184.08] P:1758.52 E:0.043526 |  Celtic fans, masses of them leaning forward,
[1184.08 - 1186.60] P:1893.15 E:0.046753 |  watching the corner come in, Courtois punches it away,
[1186.60 - 1188.08] P:2004.68 E:0.047490 |  Hachate!
[1188.08 - 1190.20] P:1998.80 E:0.051546 |  Drives the volley, Courtois makes the save,
[1190.24 - 1192.60] P:1871.77 E:0.048012 |  straight at him, but went with real power,
[1192.60 - 1196.36] P:1904.35 E:0.044012 |  Celtic still attacking, ball inside that Real Madrid penalty
[1196.36 - 1199.72] P:1906.65 E:0.049846 |  area, Real Madrid get a foot in, cleared away by Militão,
[1199.72 - 1202.52] P:1904.11 E:0.049609 |  first goal in the game in Seville, Conor McNamara.
[1202.52 - 1205.44] P:1563.88 E:0.054941 |  And in Seville, it's Manchester City 1,
[1205.44 - 1208.92] P:1536.19 E:0.049973 |  and it's Erling Haaland, the first of what city fans hope
[1208.92 - 1213.60] P:1396.52 E:0.051440 |  will be a lot of Champions League goals in Sky Blue for them,
[1213.60 - 1216.36] P:1560.41 E:0.049652 |  Kevin De Bruyne onto full, it's passed down the right,
[1216.36 - 1218.72] P:1705.92 E:0.051112 |  had a little look, played it in Lowenheim,
[1218.72 - 1222.52] P:1692.92 E:0.053575 |  and sliding through was Erling Haaland for Sevilla Niel,
[1222.52 - 1224.88] P:1814.90 E:0.051780 |  Manchester City 1, 20 minutes play.
[1224.88 - 1227.68] P:2030.86 E:0.049901 |  Well, somehow here at Celtic Park, it's still Niel Niel,
[1227.68 - 1231.60] P:1967.53 E:0.046573 |  Callum McGregor has just hit a rasping drive from 20 yards,
[1231.60 - 1234.84] P:1935.08 E:0.044784 |  and it's come crashing back off the inside of the post, James.
[1234.84 - 1237.28] P:1774.32 E:0.052440 |  That was brilliant play again, down the left hand side,
[1237.28 - 1239.60] P:1791.26 E:0.041614 |  little cut back into the feet of Jack O'Marcus,
[1239.60 - 1242.16] P:1858.62 E:0.048001 |  he has his back to go, it looks like he's going to spin,
[1242.16 - 1244.96] P:1935.38 E:0.051989 |  and try and get his shot away, it doesn't, he lays it,
[1244.96 - 1246.76] P:1978.61 E:0.053938 |  onto the unrushing Callum McGregor,
[1246.80 - 1249.72] P:1959.22 E:0.049279 |  who smashes it off the post, incredible,
[1249.72 - 1252.72] P:1887.77 E:0.045752 |  caught to a beating, half of the crowd, if not more,
[1252.72 - 1254.12] P:1805.35 E:0.038637 |  thought it was in.
[1254.12 - 1256.44] P:1772.00 E:0.051331 |  What a period of football this is for Celtic.
[1256.44 - 1258.92] P:1830.15 E:0.051021 |  Wow, they've got Real Madrid on the ropes at the moment,
[1258.92 - 1263.12] P:1843.60 E:0.048294 |  so Erling Haaland has Manchester City a goal to the good in Seville,
[1263.12 - 1266.16] P:1796.35 E:0.050673 |  Chelsea beaten by Dino Mosaagreb earlier on,
[1266.16 - 1270.72] P:1899.49 E:0.048049 |  Celtic Park in full song, back in the Champions League group stages,
[1270.72 - 1273.52] P:1835.94 E:0.047814 |  and giving Real Madrid a run for their money,
[1273.56 - 1277.28] P:1826.50 E:0.040219 |  0-0 Callum McGregor's shot coming back off the post,
[1277.28 - 1280.64] P:1807.92 E:0.041765 |  here's Mendy to Kroos, Kroos to Benzemaal,
[1280.64 - 1284.76] P:1890.29 E:0.041961 |  Benzemaal back to Mendy, this build-up play taking place just inside,
[1284.76 - 1286.64] P:1847.10 E:0.042554 |  the Celtic half on the left hand side,
[1286.64 - 1290.12] P:1910.29 E:0.039278 |  we'll get some more thoughts and ready for side in just a second.
[1291.04 - 1294.12] P:1903.06 E:0.044550 |  Here's Tua Mane, Tua Mane to Carvajal,
[1294.12 - 1296.96] P:1911.85 E:0.038582 |  Carvajal back to Militao, the centre back,
[1296.96 - 1300.40] P:2000.65 E:0.045413 |  Tony Kroos drops between the two centre backs inside his own half,
[1300.40 - 1303.44] P:2015.09 E:0.043257 |  whips it forward into the feet of Modric, able to turn,
[1303.48 - 1305.60] P:2010.57 E:0.042076 |  looks up, didn't see Benzemaal in the middle,
[1305.60 - 1310.20] P:2003.72 E:0.042819 |  so goes low to his right to find Valverde de Uruguayne with the peroxide hair,
[1310.20 - 1313.84] P:1936.45 E:0.042969 |  Benzemaal is the link man, 1-2 with Modric, we're going to find Modric again,
[1313.84 - 1316.80] P:1909.22 E:0.044099 |  Celtic get bodies around him, Greg Taylor with the first-time clearance,
[1316.80 - 1319.76] P:1978.99 E:0.050370 |  Celtic having to do that as well, up towards Jackimakis,
[1319.76 - 1322.20] P:1884.02 E:0.043491 |  he's in the one-on-one again, Celtic win the throw.
[1322.20 - 1325.12] P:1808.86 E:0.046564 |  And that is the difference between Jackimakis and Keogal,
[1325.12 - 1330.36] P:1827.42 E:0.044618 |  he looks to get away from defenders and then try and exploit the spaces that they leave,
[1330.36 - 1332.84] P:1781.42 E:0.042310 |  Jackimakis loves the physical contact,
[1332.88 - 1335.72] P:1883.10 E:0.046446 |  so in this occasion, certainly in a couple of occasions tonight,
[1335.72 - 1338.92] P:1893.43 E:0.051040 |  he is the out-ball and he will force those mistakes,
[1338.92 - 1341.80] P:1783.16 E:0.048314 |  you look at Militao, no chances, just put it out,
[1341.80 - 1344.44] P:1709.62 E:0.046705 |  he didn't want to take a touch because the new Jackimakis was there,
[1344.44 - 1347.16] P:1812.50 E:0.049121 |  waiting to put pressure on him, and that is what he's doing,
[1347.16 - 1349.08] P:1793.93 E:0.045313 |  he's causing all sorts of problems up there.
[1349.68 - 1351.76] P:1886.69 E:0.045267 |  Done it again as well, good battling for the ball,
[1351.76 - 1354.16] P:1922.27 E:0.035780 |  this time the throw and it's gone to Real Madrid,
[1354.16 - 1357.48] P:1813.94 E:0.042511 |  Celtic, Real Madrid, let's pause for breath as they take the throw,
[1357.48 - 1359.96] P:1613.19 E:0.039731 |  let's bring in Roddy Fasai.
[1359.96 - 1362.84] P:1887.98 E:0.043831 |  What have you made of the first quarter of the game?
[1362.84 - 1367.08] P:1864.17 E:0.045089 |  Well, you have to say that Angé Postercoglu has been as good as he's worked,
[1367.08 - 1369.56] P:1855.22 E:0.050446 |  Celtic haven't altered their style, they've been a little more cautious,
[1369.56 - 1371.56] P:1854.32 E:0.049022 |  here they are again inside the pounce box, over to you.
[1371.56 - 1374.28] P:1942.67 E:0.042329 |  Yeah, Hitate to O'Reilly, back to Hitate,
[1374.28 - 1376.72] P:1838.76 E:0.039738 |  tackled by Carvajal, back to Roddy in just a second,
[1376.72 - 1380.04] P:1817.91 E:0.043594 |  Modric working it with Tua Mane, little flick from Benzema,
[1380.04 - 1381.80] P:1955.72 E:0.050274 |  doesn't get enough on the pass,
[1381.80 - 1383.88] P:1926.25 E:0.045288 |  Celtic busy in themselves to win it back,
[1383.88 - 1386.04] P:1913.59 E:0.044330 |  a barter is tackled by Benzema,
[1386.04 - 1389.20] P:1845.29 E:0.040753 |  Real Madrid decide to go to the right-hand side inside their own arm,
[1389.24 - 1391.64] P:1913.62 E:0.044713 |  Modric to Tua Mane, he had time to turn,
[1391.64 - 1396.16] P:1966.55 E:0.045734 |  high floated ball gives you Ranevic a chance to beat Benzema in the air,
[1396.16 - 1398.20] P:1865.20 E:0.050414 |  wins the next ball infield to Abadda,
[1398.20 - 1401.24] P:1910.95 E:0.043194 |  why do you Ranevic tries to get it back infield to O'Reilly,
[1401.24 - 1404.88] P:2000.51 E:0.044766 |  the deflected pass is intercepted by Abadda,
[1404.88 - 1408.12] P:1998.09 E:0.045437 |  O'Reilly makes the tackle, Real Madrid get the throw, Roddy.
[1408.12 - 1411.64] P:1942.11 E:0.050509 |  I made a note when Abadda shot into the arms of Cottoir,
[1411.64 - 1415.64] P:1914.09 E:0.050975 |  at that point Celtic had six players inside the Real penalty area,
[1415.64 - 1416.96] P:1972.81 E:0.057464 |  less than half a minute later,
[1417.00 - 1420.64] P:2046.92 E:0.049320 |  every Celtic player was within 30 yards of their own goal.
[1420.64 - 1423.52] P:1943.67 E:0.042836 |  It's exactly what we hoped it would be,
[1423.52 - 1426.12] P:1868.86 E:0.036264 |  what a ticket to have if you're a Celtic fan tonight.
[1426.12 - 1429.32] P:1771.77 E:0.045431 |  It's incredible, I just get the feeling that, you know,
[1429.32 - 1432.08] P:1791.45 E:0.043496 |  Celtic are having chances, can they take one?
[1432.08 - 1433.84] P:1456.96 E:0.051569 |  Because we know the quality Real Madrid have,
[1433.84 - 1436.84] P:1792.91 E:0.042328 |  we know they can change the tempo of a game in the blink of an eye,
[1436.84 - 1441.28] P:1785.31 E:0.044258 |  but it has lived up to all expectations and hopefully it continues,
[1441.28 - 1443.56] P:1870.78 E:0.038777 |  I'm sure it will, but what a game it's been.
[1443.60 - 1447.40] P:1844.19 E:0.042579 |  I think you can probably hear the smiles in our voices.
[1447.40 - 1450.36] P:1720.15 E:0.042056 |  67 accredited media for Real Madrid tonight,
[1450.36 - 1453.00] P:1704.87 E:0.039122 |  James McFadden had to act as photographer
[1453.00 - 1454.20] P:1986.90 E:0.046938 |  for a few of them ahead of the game.
[1454.20 - 1456.20] P:1935.56 E:0.049523 |  By the way, if they score, they're sitting in front of us,
[1456.20 - 1459.00] P:1910.19 E:0.040462 |  the radio commentators, you will know about it, I can promise you,
[1459.00 - 1462.68] P:1846.70 E:0.039465 |  even inside this atmosphere here at Celtic Park.
[1462.68 - 1466.64] P:1970.12 E:0.038407 |  Celtic have won a throw, they've taken it quickly, 25 minutes gone,
[1466.64 - 1468.60] P:1922.09 E:0.041210 |  and as James and Roddy have both been saying,
[1468.60 - 1470.72] P:1798.87 E:0.042830 |  and Postercoglu, as good as his words,
[1470.72 - 1473.48] P:1905.07 E:0.040090 |  Celtic going for Real Madrid,
[1473.52 - 1475.36] P:1905.50 E:0.051339 |  and being given encouragement as well.
[1475.36 - 1477.44] P:1964.80 E:0.041308 |  Greg Taylor steaming up the left-hand side,
[1477.44 - 1480.36] P:1829.31 E:0.041185 |  challenges for the ball, Militão heads it away,
[1480.36 - 1482.12] P:1800.77 E:0.035663 |  Taylor's going to take the throw, thinks about it,
[1482.12 - 1486.40] P:1860.96 E:0.039924 |  Jota runs past him, Taylor holds onto it, now Hattate makes a run,
[1486.40 - 1487.92] P:1866.75 E:0.043036 |  Celtic players fizzing around,
[1487.92 - 1491.20] P:1863.18 E:0.040746 |  Taylor just can't decide which one to throw it to at the moment,
[1491.20 - 1495.24] P:1879.47 E:0.035025 |  now releases it, gets it back from O'Reilly,
[1495.24 - 1497.88] P:1768.69 E:0.039015 |  O'Reilly's low ball into the Real Madrid box,
[1497.88 - 1499.24] P:1882.97 E:0.051051 |  intercepted by Tuan Mayne,
[1499.24 - 1501.96] P:1965.67 E:0.041592 |  Carvajal clears on the turn, another throw into Celtic,
[1501.96 - 1505.20] P:1879.99 E:0.043069 |  taking quickly PSG 2, Juventus 0, Hattate,
[1505.20 - 1508.96] P:1887.09 E:0.047554 |  down at the byline, all when it's deflected into the side netting,
[1508.96 - 1512.68] P:1915.95 E:0.045939 |  and Celtic have a corner, and Bapé has his second goal of the night
[1512.68 - 1516.04] P:1884.04 E:0.041689 |  for Paris Saint-Germain, they lead Juventus by two goals to 0,
[1516.04 - 1518.88] P:1831.35 E:0.042783 |  Celtic could so easily be a goal all two up here.
[1518.88 - 1521.52] P:1800.32 E:0.047844 |  Yeah, some of the play has been excellent, that looked like it,
[1521.52 - 1524.68] P:1700.34 E:0.045360 |  and then this side of the net, it hit the side netting,
[1524.68 - 1526.28] P:1737.73 E:0.049674 |  what about a play as again?
[1526.28 - 1528.68] P:1918.82 E:0.044831 |  Oh, corner for Celtic, Jota kills it, in court,
[1528.72 - 1531.12] P:1915.38 E:0.039759 |  Jota is underneath it, good goalkeeping,
[1531.12 - 1533.56] P:1852.47 E:0.038022 |  takes it right off the top of the head of Jack O'Maccus,
[1533.56 - 1534.92] P:1622.60 E:0.045564 |  slings it out underarm quickly,
[1534.92 - 1538.72] P:1850.83 E:0.042688 |  now Benzemaar has laid the ball off, and is wincing,
[1538.72 - 1541.80] P:1907.10 E:0.042319 |  and is limping up towards the halfway line,
[1541.80 - 1544.16] P:1940.64 E:0.048613 |  my taxi driver today told me he'd heard a ruin
[1544.16 - 1545.84] P:2048.32 E:0.043761 |  that Benzemaar wasn't going to start the game,
[1545.84 - 1548.64] P:1922.45 E:0.044573 |  so maybe he knew more than he was letting on,
[1548.64 - 1550.32] P:1931.93 E:0.047047 |  here's Valverde on the right-hand side,
[1550.32 - 1552.32] P:1968.27 E:0.040825 |  Benzemaar is in discomfort, definitely,
[1552.32 - 1556.08] P:1917.10 E:0.035686 |  seems to be a problem with the right leg,
[1556.08 - 1557.84] P:1911.51 E:0.045715 |  Lynchpin of course for Real Madrid,
[1557.84 - 1561.08] P:1952.46 E:0.037537 |  the captain, the man who scored so many goals for them
[1561.08 - 1563.00] P:1909.93 E:0.043290 |  on the way to the trophy last season,
[1563.00 - 1565.80] P:1911.53 E:0.041818 |  did so much damage in the knockout stages,
[1565.80 - 1568.28] P:1949.16 E:0.044566 |  he's going to try and run it off, in the meantime,
[1568.28 - 1572.00] P:2013.79 E:0.046437 |  Real Madrid continue to play keep ball inside the Celtic half,
[1572.00 - 1575.84] P:1910.22 E:0.041364 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil, Manchester City one nil up,
[1575.84 - 1579.80] P:1806.44 E:0.043182 |  away to Sevilla, and he ram on Sanchez,
[1579.80 - 1583.20] P:1792.10 E:0.048057 |  piece one, stadium, Conor McNamara with the updates this evening,
[1583.20 - 1587.44] P:1901.89 E:0.041544 |  Valverde to Carvajal, cut back here looking for Vinicius,
[1587.48 - 1589.36] P:1824.14 E:0.049541 |  headed away but only as far as Carvajal,
[1589.36 - 1592.16] P:1897.78 E:0.041089 |  back it comes to Valverde looking for support on the edge of the box,
[1592.16 - 1595.20] P:2005.69 E:0.045306 |  Croce hits it first time, skidding shot goes wide,
[1595.20 - 1597.64] P:1966.06 E:0.035839 |  and behind for the Celtic goal kick, James McFarron.
[1597.64 - 1599.32] P:1638.86 E:0.055248 |  Yeah, I've been looking at Benzemaar,
[1599.32 - 1602.32] P:1834.29 E:0.035379 |  I wonder if he's just jarred his knee,
[1602.32 - 1606.28] P:1825.00 E:0.042574 |  he keeps trying to, you know, if possible stretch it off,
[1606.28 - 1609.12] P:1730.75 E:0.042340 |  but having had plenty knee problems in my career,
[1609.12 - 1611.52] P:1786.70 E:0.044337 |  I know it looks like he's struggling with his knee,
[1611.52 - 1615.56] P:1944.59 E:0.043254 |  but when the ball goes wide to Valverde there,
[1615.68 - 1619.84] P:1908.35 E:0.047207 |  he's alive again, so I think it might be all right.
[1619.84 - 1624.04] P:1923.51 E:0.041963 |  No, no, he's signalling to say, he needs change to the bench.
[1624.04 - 1627.12] P:1893.44 E:0.038887 |  Yeah, that could be that for Carriene Benzemaar,
[1627.12 - 1630.40] P:1947.67 E:0.047738 |  play continues, Celtic oppressing Courtois,
[1630.40 - 1632.08] P:1885.74 E:0.041260 |  has the ball at his feet,
[1632.08 - 1634.60] P:1771.72 E:0.051675 |  has played at this stadium before Tebow Courtois.
[1634.60 - 1637.80] P:1791.06 E:0.051081 |  I was going to make the point at the start when you say
[1637.80 - 1640.80] P:1840.38 E:0.049078 |  the Real Madrid first team have warmed up,
[1640.80 - 1642.36] P:1826.33 E:0.056975 |  you know, the subs didn't warm up,
[1642.36 - 1645.56] P:1817.88 E:0.046956 |  they've been forced into a relatively early change,
[1645.56 - 1647.04] P:1633.49 E:0.048839 |  I wonder if that has an impact.
[1647.04 - 1648.20] P:1922.26 E:0.047281 |  Have you ever seen that?
[1648.20 - 1650.20] P:1688.13 E:0.045659 |  I mean, maybe they were warming up inside...
[1650.20 - 1653.64] P:1677.74 E:0.048489 |  There's no where in there at the moment, let me tell you that.
[1653.64 - 1655.44] P:1416.77 E:0.053485 |  There is no where for them to warm up in there,
[1655.44 - 1657.16] P:1764.80 E:0.039230 |  but it was strange.
[1657.16 - 1659.24] P:1709.63 E:0.046545 |  And I was thinking that, if they're forced into an early change,
[1659.24 - 1660.68] P:1770.75 E:0.041267 |  well, will they be ready?
[1660.68 - 1662.28] P:2028.04 E:0.038006 |  Yeah, Valverde bringing it forward,
[1662.28 - 1664.16] P:1861.64 E:0.035954 |  so Benzemaar's still out there,
[1664.16 - 1665.64] P:1868.01 E:0.043767 |  and looking dangerous edge of the box,
[1665.64 - 1668.16] P:1911.52 E:0.040237 |  but he is struggling and he does want to come off.
[1668.16 - 1671.04] P:1951.59 E:0.039333 |  Celtic nail, Real Madrid nail.
[1671.04 - 1673.44] P:1945.98 E:0.044785 |  Now, let's not have too much sympathy for the European champions,
[1673.44 - 1675.44] P:1872.94 E:0.041140 |  because Quijogo is on the bench for Celtic,
[1675.44 - 1676.84] P:1895.75 E:0.045781 |  not able to start the game tonight,
[1676.84 - 1680.40] P:1695.77 E:0.040287 |  he would have been their first choice centre-forward.
[1680.40 - 1681.80] P:1674.21 E:0.048565 |  So it's tipped for...
[1681.80 - 1685.00] P:1561.63 E:0.044291 |  In that sense, if Benzemaar does come off,
[1685.00 - 1687.20] P:1763.14 E:0.043018 |  Arby Salzburg have taken the lead
[1687.20 - 1690.72] P:1716.19 E:0.039617 |  against the Italian champions, AC Milan.
[1690.72 - 1693.44] P:1874.04 E:0.045871 |  Valverde causing problems again for Celtic down the right,
[1693.44 - 1695.52] P:1896.26 E:0.035399 |  Cross comes into the near post,
[1695.52 - 1698.04] P:1879.80 E:0.044949 |  Chuimani the furthest forward, beating in the air,
[1698.04 - 1701.00] P:1814.30 E:0.041981 |  Celtic, Cliric, Modric is there, flicks a little pass back,
[1701.00 - 1704.44] P:1760.72 E:0.042869 |  to the halfway line, and Real Madrid will start to recycle again.
[1704.44 - 1705.92] P:1637.40 E:0.050784 |  Yeah, and this is a period in the match
[1705.92 - 1707.92] P:1614.96 E:0.044008 |  where Celtic have dropped off Real Madrid,
[1707.92 - 1710.12] P:1642.30 E:0.040266 |  and almost allowed the ball in front,
[1710.12 - 1713.60] P:1745.45 E:0.038852 |  but they have such quick movement, speed of thought,
[1713.60 - 1716.20] P:1791.02 E:0.044244 |  that they are getting down the sides, as you would expect,
[1716.20 - 1718.96] P:1780.45 E:0.035755 |  but it's just almost like they're taking a little breather,
[1718.96 - 1721.04] P:1706.86 E:0.040351 |  they're not going chasing it,
[1721.04 - 1723.08] P:1743.64 E:0.041286 |  because they will leave gaps,
[1723.08 - 1725.44] P:1801.60 E:0.035981 |  but they're quite happy, I would say,
[1725.44 - 1727.60] P:1706.37 E:0.041171 |  for Real Madrid to have the ball, not in this area.
[1727.60 - 1729.40] P:1945.63 E:0.041852 |  Carvajal, little ball with the out of his right,
[1729.40 - 1732.04] P:2030.75 E:0.044233 |  but Valverde, just wide with his left foot,
[1732.04 - 1734.12] P:1930.74 E:0.044217 |  that went like an absolute rocket,
[1734.12 - 1735.56] P:2016.03 E:0.038200 |  and there was a flash of yellow,
[1735.56 - 1738.24] P:1901.50 E:0.043904 |  as Johar, he was worried through himself,
[1738.24 - 1739.68] P:1973.68 E:0.044677 |  full length to the left hand side,
[1739.68 - 1741.32] P:1856.99 E:0.042307 |  went behind for the goal kick,
[1741.32 - 1744.52] P:1974.30 E:0.038738 |  Real Madrid are going to have to make the change,
[1744.52 - 1745.48] P:1861.97 E:0.046831 |  thoughts from Roddy Versailles.
[1745.48 - 1747.48] P:1875.02 E:0.042791 |  Looks like Eden Hazard is going to come on, isn't it,
[1747.48 - 1748.56] P:1744.20 E:0.038392 |  for Benzema.
[1748.56 - 1750.00] P:1839.81 E:0.036196 |  The lessers spotted.
[1750.00 - 1751.68] P:1820.55 E:0.043031 |  Yes, and there we go,
[1751.68 - 1755.76] P:1893.17 E:0.052725 |  and that's a forced change that Real Madrid will not wish to have made.
[1755.76 - 1757.44] P:2066.24 E:0.045228 |  No, well that's interesting.
[1757.48 - 1760.68] P:1912.98 E:0.052820 |  Eden Hazard, two substitute appearances so far,
[1760.68 - 1762.52] P:1916.11 E:0.048055 |  for Real Madrid this season.
[1762.52 - 1764.76] P:1923.30 E:0.051578 |  Not a bad player though, let's get to Seville,
[1764.76 - 1765.92] P:1913.91 E:0.040334 |  Conor McNamara.
[1765.92 - 1766.96] P:1772.33 E:0.055105 |  Just approaching the half,
[1766.96 - 1768.08] P:1751.62 E:0.050693 |  our mark still Seville,
[1768.08 - 1770.72] P:1648.98 E:0.053362 |  and El Manchester City won the goal from Erling Hallad,
[1770.72 - 1772.20] P:1663.23 E:0.052035 |  City have just had a free kick,
[1772.20 - 1774.40] P:1688.72 E:0.049483 |  taken by Kevin De Bruyne, close,
[1774.40 - 1775.56] P:1633.10 E:0.052843 |  but into the side netting,
[1775.56 - 1776.92] P:1448.39 E:0.052937 |  City are dominating now,
[1776.92 - 1778.76] P:1605.29 E:0.052708 |  Seville did well in the early stages,
[1778.76 - 1781.48] P:1666.78 E:0.048951 |  but City on top, Seville and El Manchester City won.
[1781.48 - 1784.32] P:2030.24 E:0.036876 |  So, Carin Benzema drags himself from the field,
[1784.32 - 1787.44] P:1915.19 E:0.042231 |  he's level on 86 Champions League goals at the moment,
[1787.44 - 1789.44] P:1805.71 E:0.040253 |  with Robert Lewandowski,
[1789.44 - 1791.76] P:1847.65 E:0.044373 |  who will play in this season's competition for Barcelona.
[1791.76 - 1792.88] P:1821.60 E:0.038286 |  Quick word with Ancelotti,
[1792.88 - 1794.00] P:1948.42 E:0.041741 |  you noticed there, James,
[1794.00 - 1797.48] P:1903.25 E:0.043029 |  sort of respectful applause from the Celtic fans for one of the greats.
[1797.48 - 1798.96] P:1561.10 E:0.051284 |  Yeah, they applauded Benzema off,
[1798.96 - 1802.16] P:1639.01 E:0.045730 |  I think it'll be delighted to see him going off as well,
[1802.16 - 1803.68] P:1667.08 E:0.043820 |  to be fair, but yeah, I think it is.
[1803.68 - 1806.84] P:1748.78 E:0.042229 |  I think the recognition is a great of the game,
[1806.84 - 1809.00] P:1752.09 E:0.043302 |  playing at the highest level,
[1809.00 - 1812.00] P:1766.04 E:0.041088 |  great numbers last season for Benzema.
[1812.00 - 1814.20] P:1742.36 E:0.045127 |  I think it's just appreciation from the Celtic fans,
[1814.20 - 1816.20] P:1843.38 E:0.038142 |  which are not here, but in general,
[1816.20 - 1818.88] P:1825.22 E:0.028343 |  you don't often see from away fans.
[1818.88 - 1820.56] P:1732.37 E:0.042565 |  Celtic Niel Real Madrid Niel,
[1820.56 - 1822.32] P:1764.80 E:0.031395 |  former Scotland international,
[1822.32 - 1826.44] P:1868.02 E:0.041711 |  James McFadden used to scoring big goals on the biggest stages,
[1826.44 - 1827.52] P:1798.13 E:0.039104 |  particularly for his country,
[1827.52 - 1830.76] P:1882.14 E:0.041329 |  alongside us in the commentary position at Celtic Park tonight,
[1830.76 - 1833.40] P:1842.52 E:0.043277 |  and Celtic have made a really good start to this game,
[1833.40 - 1835.76] P:1852.69 E:0.047693 |  and a really good start on their return
[1835.76 - 1837.60] P:1910.91 E:0.047641 |  to the Champions League group stages.
[1837.60 - 1839.92] P:1905.46 E:0.037142 |  Leipzig and Schachtar Dignetsk,
[1839.92 - 1841.44] P:1730.21 E:0.053432 |  the other two teams in this group,
[1841.44 - 1843.84] P:1913.98 E:0.040888 |  Schachtar one up away to Leipzig at the moment,
[1843.88 - 1845.88] P:1786.03 E:0.045957 |  a barter on the right, tries to get a low cross in,
[1845.88 - 1849.12] P:1816.75 E:0.038962 |  Mendy deals with it, closes him down and blocks it at close range.
[1849.12 - 1852.68] P:1892.98 E:0.041495 |  So Hazard has dropped into the centre-forward's position,
[1852.68 - 1855.84] P:1903.97 E:0.051106 |  good dribbler in the ball, runs straight to Moritz Jens,
[1855.84 - 1860.32] P:1839.60 E:0.040000 |  is felled and is flat on his face in the centre-circle.
[1860.32 - 1862.48] P:1780.05 E:0.042060 |  Terrible injury problems for Aiden Hazard,
[1862.48 - 1864.24] P:1876.51 E:0.035910 |  since joining Real Madrid.
[1864.24 - 1866.00] P:1944.79 E:0.035912 |  Fourth season at the club,
[1866.00 - 1870.04] P:1861.59 E:0.037121 |  68 appearances so far, and just the six goals.
[1870.04 - 1873.20] P:1723.94 E:0.041213 |  And if you think, James, of what he was at Chelsea,
[1873.20 - 1876.00] P:1787.95 E:0.043439 |  Real Madrid have seen barely glimpses of that.
[1876.00 - 1878.16] P:1508.45 E:0.056058 |  They've seen nowhere near the Aiden Hazard,
[1878.16 - 1880.64] P:1707.51 E:0.038337 |  that we all got to witness in the Premier League,
[1880.64 - 1882.64] P:1877.91 E:0.034920 |  it was absolutely sensational,
[1882.64 - 1886.44] P:1782.99 E:0.052278 |  and you felt as though he was going to go and be one of their galacticals,
[1886.44 - 1889.68] P:1827.37 E:0.049055 |  one of their superstars, it just hasn't quite worked out for him.
[1889.68 - 1893.04] P:1890.71 E:0.054118 |  But you see him there, picking off, he wants to get in a half-turn,
[1893.04 - 1895.56] P:1784.58 E:0.051732 |  not Meg on Jens, Calvary Gregor is covering,
[1895.56 - 1898.80] P:1811.79 E:0.050126 |  but he is brought down, and that's a different proposition for Celtic,
[1898.80 - 1901.32] P:1742.53 E:0.053304 |  because Benzmann would have played that earlier to Valverde,
[1901.32 - 1904.56] P:1830.04 E:0.047847 |  I've no doubt about it, but Hazard wants to go and take people on.
[1904.56 - 1907.08] P:1969.36 E:0.045316 |  Like in the look of young Tua Mani in central midfield,
[1907.08 - 1910.12] P:1850.84 E:0.048162 |  lovely little body swerve to beat Hitata, it's with Valverde,
[1910.12 - 1912.84] P:1876.17 E:0.041904 |  little one-two with Hazard on the edge of the Celtic box.
[1912.84 - 1915.24] P:1791.92 E:0.043845 |  Celtic-Nil, Real Madrid-Nil, Modric,
[1915.24 - 1918.68] P:1808.82 E:0.046716 |  with one of those cheeky little outside-of-the-right footballs,
[1918.68 - 1924.12] P:1879.37 E:0.046119 |  doesn't find its target, and Johard comes racing across to collect it.
[1924.12 - 1928.80] P:1864.93 E:0.044048 |  So, five times Champions League winners for Real Madrid
[1928.80 - 1930.32] P:1864.28 E:0.040802 |  in this starting line-up tonight.
[1930.36 - 1935.88] P:1666.36 E:0.040028 |  Carvajal, Modric and Benzmann, who is now off the field, of course,
[1935.88 - 1939.20] P:1719.55 E:0.034279 |  in terms of the Celtic squad this evening.
[1939.20 - 1944.04] P:1803.84 E:0.039631 |  Three players who were last involved when Celtic were last in the group stages
[1944.04 - 1947.00] P:1798.69 E:0.039965 |  under Bretton Rogers back in 2017-18,
[1947.00 - 1948.60] P:1727.46 E:0.043815 |  one of those, the skipper, Callum McGregor,
[1948.60 - 1951.16] P:1833.80 E:0.044859 |  who struck the inside of the post this evening.
[1951.16 - 1953.92] P:1794.61 E:0.042769 |  Real Madrid having a little spell of possession here.
[1953.92 - 1957.12] P:1878.55 E:0.042594 |  Carvajal floats a pass back onto the chest of Alibar,
[1957.12 - 1959.52] P:1903.70 E:0.047551 |  he was aware of Abadda closing in behind him,
[1959.56 - 1962.20] P:1836.01 E:0.046544 |  so just shields the ball away from him, low to crows.
[1962.20 - 1967.56] P:1870.09 E:0.043403 |  Venetius Jr. comes towards the ball, lays it off to Mendy on the left-hand side.
[1967.56 - 1970.24] P:1677.27 E:0.041394 |  I hope this atmosphere is coming through loud and clear
[1970.24 - 1974.08] P:1810.41 E:0.045832 |  wherever you're listening to us on five live BBC sounds this evening.
[1974.08 - 1976.48] P:1711.98 E:0.046503 |  Carvajal on the right for Real Madrid,
[1976.48 - 1982.08] P:1805.58 E:0.041281 |  Nil-Nil, Tua-Maini takes his time, rolls the pass to Valverde.
[1982.08 - 1984.68] P:1783.44 E:0.046180 |  Valverde wide on the right back to Tua-Maini,
[1984.68 - 1987.92] P:1882.95 E:0.044497 |  first time layoff to Carvajal, Celtic having to chase,
[1987.92 - 1993.12] P:1742.38 E:0.039664 |  but keeping Real Madrid out from the danger zones at the moment.
[1993.12 - 1995.72] P:1655.92 E:0.041581 |  Kroos passes across the halfway line,
[1995.72 - 1998.24] P:1757.90 E:0.046845 |  Edair Militão encouraged to bring it forward,
[1998.24 - 2001.36] P:2040.68 E:0.037147 |  Valverde hugging the touchline on the right,
[2001.36 - 2005.52] P:1978.67 E:0.049797 |  infield pass to Modric, loses it, Jota dribbling out,
[2005.52 - 2008.84] P:1954.78 E:0.042233 |  Carvajal slides in, meaty challenge takes the ball,
[2008.84 - 2012.24] P:1974.70 E:0.045011 |  Jota picks himself up, Celtic worked it quickly to the right,
[2012.24 - 2015.40] P:1828.89 E:0.040843 |  and then, bit like the old Bino character, Billy Wiz,
[2015.40 - 2018.52] P:1889.52 E:0.046505 |  with his legs speeding away down the right,
[2018.52 - 2022.08] P:1769.55 E:0.035131 |  making ground for Celtic, back it comes to Callum McGregor.
[2022.08 - 2025.00] P:1763.20 E:0.040475 |  McGregor strokes it with his left foot to Greg Taylor,
[2025.00 - 2026.92] P:1739.43 E:0.045883 |  the left back popping up in the centre,
[2026.92 - 2029.16] P:1737.42 E:0.047563 |  so what do you see with the Celtic fullbacks?
[2029.16 - 2033.72] P:1678.14 E:0.043141 |  The fullbacks come in and play in midfield positions to try and tempt
[2033.72 - 2037.52] P:1601.22 E:0.044896 |  the opposition to go and put pressure on, they're so comfortable doing it,
[2037.52 - 2039.20] P:1808.22 E:0.051336 |  and it's worked really well.
[2039.20 - 2043.00] P:1702.58 E:0.042718 |  Greg Taylor, in particular this season, has been sensational for Celtic,
[2043.00 - 2046.08] P:1860.50 E:0.052935 |  and it's no surprise, he's a good player, probably doesn't get the clod,
[2046.08 - 2048.40] P:1967.16 E:0.051923 |  he deserves it, but that's how he wants to play,
[2048.40 - 2050.64] P:1794.87 E:0.047882 |  he wants to build up from the back, he wants to take risks,
[2050.64 - 2052.44] P:1855.04 E:0.036460 |  we heard them speak yesterday,
[2052.44 - 2056.00] P:1802.23 E:0.042749 |  if there's the greater the risk, the greater the reward sometimes,
[2056.00 - 2057.52] P:1766.74 E:0.037138 |  and that's the way they play.
[2057.52 - 2060.68] P:1878.57 E:0.039301 |  That's why the Celtic fans absolutely love it, and love And post-Akoglu,
[2060.68 - 2064.12] P:1891.73 E:0.046638 |  Yuranovic, by the way, got a massive cheer for a really well-timed tackle
[2064.12 - 2066.32] P:1919.11 E:0.041871 |  on Venetius Junior, Celtic have it on the left,
[2066.32 - 2068.88] P:1833.45 E:0.043730 |  Jota going on the outside of Carvajal, deflected cross,
[2068.88 - 2072.44] P:1869.35 E:0.045085 |  headed away by Militão, Hazard leaps in the air, miss cue pass,
[2072.48 - 2074.68] P:1807.78 E:0.041858 |  Jota, he ends, reads it, steps forward,
[2074.68 - 2077.84] P:1914.38 E:0.038750 |  Greg Taylor into Jack-o-mack, he tries to turn Militão,
[2077.84 - 2080.44] P:1850.16 E:0.050222 |  bundles into a couple of Real Madrid defenders,
[2080.44 - 2084.12] P:1870.14 E:0.046003 |  and the referee says he's being overly physical there
[2084.12 - 2086.28] P:1813.30 E:0.039577 |  against Carvajal and Militão,
[2086.28 - 2092.04] P:1867.18 E:0.042643 |  so Real Madrid get the free kick, just short of 35 minutes played in the first half,
[2092.04 - 2095.16] P:1770.95 E:0.042022 |  Celtic nil Real Madrid nil, but if you have just tuned in,
[2095.16 - 2097.84] P:1833.80 E:0.042774 |  Celtic have not only James given as good as they got,
[2097.84 - 2100.84] P:1854.69 E:0.045709 |  they could easily have scored, and McGregor struck the post,
[2100.84 - 2103.20] P:1870.47 E:0.045597 |  and they've had another chance for a barter as well.
[2103.20 - 2105.40] P:1491.04 E:0.040211 |  Yeah, Celtic have had the best chances in the game,
[2105.40 - 2108.40] P:1704.47 E:0.041572 |  there's no doubt about it, and they've played really well.
[2108.40 - 2112.12] P:1569.02 E:0.043505 |  It hasn't been the gung-ho throw bodies forward every opportunity,
[2112.12 - 2115.12] P:1689.94 E:0.040139 |  there's been a bit more control in when to go and press,
[2115.12 - 2117.40] P:1749.57 E:0.042130 |  but when they've broke, they've broke with the same intensity,
[2117.40 - 2119.76] P:1759.07 E:0.046394 |  the same speed, and just looking before that,
[2119.76 - 2122.84] P:1817.30 E:0.040731 |  when the ball comes to Hazard, because it's not Benzema,
[2122.84 - 2126.20] P:1785.50 E:0.042821 |  he tries to flick it first time, you know, he has to hold that in,
[2126.20 - 2129.00] P:1811.59 E:0.043739 |  and then play it, but he's not playing the lot of football,
[2129.04 - 2131.80] P:1627.18 E:0.037914 |  he's not going to centre-forward, which isn't his natural position,
[2131.80 - 2135.88] P:1596.60 E:0.039628 |  but that's the thing that Real Madrid will be missing from that intelligence,
[2135.88 - 2137.88] P:1591.00 E:0.045346 |  that know-how of playing that position,
[2137.88 - 2140.48] P:1696.90 E:0.042810 |  no one went to take a touch, no one went to play it first time,
[2140.48 - 2143.64] P:1693.72 E:0.039567 |  and Hazard will need to learn that quick, because if he does that again,
[2143.64 - 2146.16] P:1834.50 E:0.037078 |  Celtic are just encouraged to go and press and attack.
[2146.16 - 2149.44] P:1853.11 E:0.042968 |  Celtic nil Real Madrid nil, Manchester City one nil up,
[2149.44 - 2151.56] P:1806.00 E:0.046797 |  away to Sevilla, Erling Haaland with the goal,
[2151.56 - 2153.96] P:2026.37 E:0.041568 |  and Bapay has two tonight for Paris Saint-Germain,
[2153.96 - 2156.16] P:1995.46 E:0.040331 |  they lead Juventus by two goals,
[2156.16 - 2160.44] P:2047.02 E:0.042714 |  this group's Shakhtar Dignetsk one up, away to RB Leipzig,
[2160.44 - 2165.16] P:1994.66 E:0.048536 |  and the Italian champions AC Milano behind, away to Salzburg.
[2165.16 - 2169.16] P:2057.75 E:0.041991 |  Valverde on the ball, edge of the Celtic area, this is dangerous.
[2169.16 - 2173.04] P:1888.60 E:0.041706 |  For Posterkoglu's team, ball breaks loose down by the byline,
[2173.04 - 2176.80] P:1952.40 E:0.046946 |  Valverde whips the cross in, it's over-hit, it's beyond Milletown,
[2176.80 - 2178.96] P:1936.71 E:0.038661 |  who sort of puts his hands to his face,
[2178.96 - 2180.24] P:1760.98 E:0.038538 |  he's sort of mock horror, thinking,
[2180.24 - 2183.88] P:1784.77 E:0.039166 |  wow, if the cross was right there, I was in for a free header at the far post.
[2183.92 - 2186.16] P:1896.34 E:0.045690 |  Chelsea beaten by a goal to nil away to Dino Mosa,
[2186.16 - 2189.16] P:1850.12 E:0.037111 |  grabbed this evening, reaction to that, I'm sure,
[2189.16 - 2191.40] P:1827.43 E:0.033311 |  later on in the show tonight.
[2191.40 - 2192.96] P:1738.90 E:0.045689 |  Also in the Football Daily podcast,
[2192.96 - 2195.04] P:1782.81 E:0.048883 |  available for you on the BBC Sounds tomorrow.
[2195.04 - 2197.04] P:1843.31 E:0.043010 |  Another goal for England's women in the World Cup,
[2197.04 - 2200.40] P:1805.01 E:0.044755 |  qualifier against Luxembourg early in the second half, Gary Flintot.
[2200.40 - 2203.00] P:1782.62 E:0.051882 |  Yep, two minutes into the second half, it's six nil,
[2203.00 - 2205.72] P:1783.88 E:0.049889 |  Bethany England came on at the break, two minutes later,
[2205.72 - 2209.40] P:1801.83 E:0.044795 |  she's scored from close range, England six, Luxembourg now.
[2209.40 - 2213.64] P:1717.91 E:0.043957 |  Will they get the nine that Celtic got against Dundee United the other day?
[2213.64 - 2214.68] P:1922.75 E:0.039778 |  Let's wait and see.
[2214.68 - 2217.56] P:1824.37 E:0.044710 |  First-time ball looking for a barter from Hattate,
[2217.56 - 2221.40] P:1901.61 E:0.036981 |  covered by Alaba, back to Courtois,
[2221.40 - 2225.56] P:1808.55 E:0.042727 |  Courtois, who, as I said, has been here before with Atletico Madrid
[2225.56 - 2228.72] P:1768.25 E:0.047776 |  for a Europa League tie back in November 2011,
[2228.72 - 2232.08] P:1857.51 E:0.045575 |  so he knows what European nights at this stadium are all about.
[2232.08 - 2235.72] P:1932.29 E:0.041162 |  Hugely experienced players in the Real Madrid team,
[2235.72 - 2239.64] P:1703.82 E:0.041131 |  but I also remember the likes of Messi and Javi talking about their visits here
[2239.64 - 2245.80] P:1795.97 E:0.042206 |  and being, you know, for players of that stature to be blown away by an atmosphere.
[2245.80 - 2249.36] P:1587.33 E:0.043175 |  Carvajal on the ball, on the right foot for Real Madrid.
[2249.36 - 2252.16] P:1748.80 E:0.045393 |  They've had plenty of possession in the first half, there has been threat,
[2252.16 - 2253.64] P:1870.78 E:0.031218 |  you would definitely expect that.
[2253.64 - 2256.20] P:1850.79 E:0.039549 |  Here's Croce running away from Jaquimakis,
[2256.20 - 2259.20] P:1860.08 E:0.041696 |  curling low ball across the halfway line,
[2259.20 - 2262.48] P:1941.39 E:0.043383 |  Venetius drops the shoulder onto his right foot,
[2262.48 - 2265.12] P:1869.80 E:0.039125 |  and then he makes a little run beyond him on the left,
[2265.12 - 2267.64] P:1835.70 E:0.043834 |  stabs the ball in field to Croce,
[2267.64 - 2270.40] P:1933.83 E:0.035401 |  Croce at walking pace,
[2270.40 - 2274.24] P:1898.80 E:0.045920 |  plays it onto Modric, darts forward, 25 yards out,
[2274.24 - 2277.40] P:1883.90 E:0.040422 |  slides it to his right to Valverde, now Carvajal,
[2277.40 - 2280.40] P:1886.96 E:0.042877 |  back to Valverde again, corner of the Celtic box,
[2280.40 - 2283.00] P:1866.96 E:0.041334 |  looking for Hazard, cleared,
[2283.00 - 2286.36] P:1762.83 E:0.047161 |  only as far as Felau Mende, Real Madrid's left back,
[2286.36 - 2288.72] P:1810.83 E:0.045138 |  and Venetius is going to get another run at Juranovic,
[2288.72 - 2292.96] P:1837.20 E:0.040470 |  who's so carefully watching that Champions League in Blazend football
[2292.96 - 2295.76] P:1905.76 E:0.040485 |  at the tricky feet of Venetius Junior.
[2295.76 - 2297.32] P:1861.82 E:0.052026 |  Hazard on the ball, wide on the left,
[2297.36 - 2299.20] P:1954.95 E:0.037574 |  rolls it back to Croce,
[2299.20 - 2301.08] P:1954.07 E:0.049026 |  early cross into the far post,
[2301.08 - 2302.80] P:1943.85 E:0.043823 |  Carvajal there with the knockback,
[2302.80 - 2305.72] P:1851.89 E:0.047437 |  Kartevicas reads it, his clearance goes straight up in the air,
[2305.72 - 2307.64] P:1935.82 E:0.041671 |  the offside flag goes up in the air,
[2307.64 - 2309.60] P:1851.90 E:0.043822 |  Celtic will get a free kick, James McFadden.
[2309.60 - 2311.64] P:1463.98 E:0.053153 |  Yeah, but it's something that they've been looking for.
[2311.64 - 2313.88] P:1760.57 E:0.048760 |  When the ball comes from the left into the right,
[2313.88 - 2317.04] P:1699.21 E:0.042987 |  and that inside channel, Valverde makes a run,
[2317.04 - 2320.32] P:1501.73 E:0.051291 |  Carvajal makes a run, that diagonal run in behind Greg Taylor,
[2320.32 - 2323.00] P:1741.43 E:0.045125 |  and this occasion Greg Taylor can see Valverde's there,
[2323.00 - 2325.72] P:1671.83 E:0.052205 |  but he can't see Carvajal coming in behind Valverde,
[2325.72 - 2330.32] P:1885.40 E:0.049106 |  and it's something that maybe Jota has to switch on and get him beside.
[2330.32 - 2332.40] P:1736.12 E:0.045497 |  Thankfully, you know, for Celtic, it is offside,
[2332.40 - 2334.72] P:1800.21 E:0.044398 |  but it's something that Real Madrid are trying to play.
[2334.72 - 2336.88] P:1990.27 E:0.051960 |  Yeah, a couple of the crosses have been over hit as well.
[2336.88 - 2338.84] P:1944.85 E:0.039781 |  Militows come through the back of Jack O'Macken.
[2338.84 - 2340.80] P:1943.52 E:0.048446 |  Look at that, the ball was stopped still.
[2340.80 - 2343.68] P:1892.48 E:0.046846 |  Hattate runs forward, just clips it, takes the free kick,
[2343.68 - 2345.52] P:1927.14 E:0.042980 |  Jota into the penalty area on the left,
[2345.52 - 2347.48] P:1915.90 E:0.049567 |  there's the cross, too close to Courtois,
[2347.48 - 2349.16] P:1870.51 E:0.045136 |  who gathers it easily at the near post.
[2349.16 - 2353.92] P:1836.29 E:0.040917 |  He was looking for a barter, again a classic example of what Celtic do.
[2353.92 - 2357.84] P:1820.64 E:0.046966 |  Hattate switched on, and there's a foul from the centre forward,
[2357.84 - 2360.64] P:1682.51 E:0.042083 |  he was just back on his feet, number seven on number seven.
[2360.64 - 2364.24] P:1726.43 E:0.043890 |  Jack O'Macken clatters into Hazard and apologises
[2364.24 - 2366.00] P:1731.88 E:0.039449 |  with a little kiss on the back of his head.
[2366.00 - 2369.64] P:1686.27 E:0.049949 |  Yeah, and he's taken a sore one in the leg as well with that tackle.
[2371.20 - 2373.88] P:1776.93 E:0.045233 |  It's just the commitment that he's got, you know,
[2373.88 - 2376.52] P:1849.32 E:0.043796 |  Jack O'Macken to go what, put pressure on.
[2376.52 - 2379.36] P:1713.06 E:0.042434 |  I don't know if he had to make that foul because of where it was,
[2379.36 - 2381.68] P:1674.01 E:0.044781 |  and if you're, you know, in Hazard,
[2381.68 - 2383.32] P:1417.47 E:0.054162 |  you don't want him anywhere near you at box,
[2383.32 - 2386.52] P:1627.81 E:0.042686 |  if he's in his own half, then you don't need to be diving in.
[2386.52 - 2389.12] P:1769.80 E:0.035054 |  He didn't get booked, he could have done,
[2389.12 - 2390.96] P:1627.87 E:0.045321 |  but, you know, he's taken a little knock,
[2390.96 - 2392.76] P:1779.97 E:0.038168 |  and hopefully it's not too serious.
[2392.76 - 2395.88] P:1785.86 E:0.043197 |  Still goalless at Celtic Park, five minutes remaining,
[2395.88 - 2401.44] P:1694.63 E:0.039106 |  and what's been a thoroughly entertaining, atmospheric, intriguing first half.
[2401.44 - 2404.52] P:1732.12 E:0.038831 |  And Prostakoglu, I'm not sure the hands have come out of the pockets
[2404.52 - 2405.80] P:1732.70 E:0.048594 |  for the entire first half.
[2405.80 - 2409.72] P:1819.99 E:0.041587 |  Two incredibly laid-back managers, actually, Prostakoglu and Ancelotti.
[2409.72 - 2413.12] P:1848.31 E:0.044571 |  Ancelotti's got the arms crossed in his dark, smart suit,
[2413.72 - 2416.04] P:1876.90 E:0.042576 |  Valverde down the right to Modric,
[2416.04 - 2417.88] P:1919.15 E:0.042592 |  Hattate breathing down his neck.
[2417.88 - 2420.52] P:1912.34 E:0.039632 |  Modric tries to turn him, almost does that,
[2420.52 - 2423.32] P:1908.74 E:0.046523 |  lays it back here to Carvajal, Carvajal low-crossing.
[2423.32 - 2424.96] P:1896.78 E:0.049959 |  Oh, it went all the way through to Hazard.
[2424.96 - 2428.64] P:1906.21 E:0.046609 |  It's slightly miscued, the ball is loose, it eventually goes behind,
[2428.64 - 2431.36] P:1968.08 E:0.045148 |  and it is a goal kick. Hazard got the last touch.
[2431.36 - 2432.40] P:1893.48 E:0.037226 |  Could have scored.
[2432.40 - 2434.68] P:1933.12 E:0.048125 |  He should have scored. There's a huge lay-off.
[2434.68 - 2437.64] P:1565.88 E:0.046539 |  Spoke about that run, and behind the fill-backs.
[2437.64 - 2440.00] P:1768.06 E:0.045971 |  Hazard just peels off the back of Yiranovic.
[2440.00 - 2442.08] P:1912.01 E:0.043617 |  Celtic are giving it away, Valverde is onto it.
[2442.12 - 2445.12] P:1894.47 E:0.042386 |  Callum McGregor has rescued Celtic twice in the last couple of minutes,
[2445.12 - 2446.72] P:1918.23 E:0.040819 |  being alert to the danger.
[2446.72 - 2448.68] P:1886.28 E:0.045421 |  It's gone behind for a Celtic goal kick.
[2448.68 - 2449.96] P:1777.00 E:0.038049 |  They'll take that quickly.
[2449.96 - 2453.44] P:1833.03 E:0.045655 |  Cardovic is under pressure, plays the pass out in plenty of time.
[2453.44 - 2456.96] P:1853.50 E:0.040587 |  Here's Hattate, Hattate down the right to Yiranovic.
[2456.96 - 2459.04] P:1874.85 E:0.040002 |  Yiranovic crosses the halfway line.
[2459.04 - 2461.60] P:1841.33 E:0.037176 |  Tony Kroos comes towards him, Yiranovic stops,
[2461.60 - 2463.92] P:1824.48 E:0.043503 |  plays it back to Hattate, heading back to Seville.
[2463.92 - 2468.88] P:1814.49 E:0.044023 |  Shortly last we heard Manchester City leading Seville by a goal to Nill.
[2468.88 - 2471.36] P:1847.39 E:0.034303 |  Greg Taylor quickly onto Jota.
[2471.36 - 2475.28] P:1685.30 E:0.044785 |  Jota's not really been able to express himself too much in the first half.
[2475.28 - 2478.52] P:1765.00 E:0.042035 |  Little step over from him. He loves the tricks, loves the flicks.
[2478.52 - 2480.16] P:1744.02 E:0.043661 |  He was doing plenty of that on Saturday.
[2480.16 - 2483.68] P:1690.61 E:0.040769 |  Celtic back to Jens on the halfway line,
[2483.68 - 2486.84] P:1899.48 E:0.043740 |  to Carter Vickers, good, crisp low pass to the right.
[2486.84 - 2489.44] P:1919.46 E:0.043113 |  Yiranovic gets a crossing. That's good delivery,
[2489.44 - 2492.72] P:1953.64 E:0.044420 |  but it's beyond O'Reilly and it's beyond Jack O'Mackess.
[2492.72 - 2496.40] P:1976.47 E:0.046527 |  And out it goes for a Celtic throw, roared on by the Celtic fans.
[2496.40 - 2498.56] P:1964.50 E:0.037516 |  Jota sprints to take the throw quickly.
[2498.56 - 2500.40] P:1872.56 E:0.034324 |  Ball is back in play immediately.
[2500.40 - 2504.00] P:1829.92 E:0.040153 |  Here's McGregor, drops the shoulder to try and lose Modric.
[2504.00 - 2507.04] P:1827.77 E:0.041306 |  Carter Vickers, another fabulous ball from the centre back.
[2507.04 - 2510.88] P:1832.70 E:0.041729 |  Whitey Yiranovic, low cross driven in, indecepted by Kroos.
[2510.88 - 2515.12] P:1833.35 E:0.041979 |  Hazard plays a first-time ball up towards Venetius, back to Hazard.
[2515.12 - 2519.44] P:1962.36 E:0.048856 |  Stokey figure, left-footed ball over the top, offside flag stays down.
[2519.44 - 2522.24] P:2003.79 E:0.048739 |  This is trouble for Celtic. Venetius Jr. in on goal.
[2522.24 - 2525.36] P:2027.12 E:0.048448 |  Johar Fabulous comes out, makes himself big
[2525.36 - 2528.56] P:1977.72 E:0.043626 |  and makes an absolutely vital save for Celtic.
[2528.64 - 2530.88] P:1863.46 E:0.055977 |  That's a huge save. I have to say, first glance,
[2530.88 - 2534.08] P:1900.77 E:0.046664 |  I thought it was Miles offside, but the flag stayed down
[2534.08 - 2536.40] P:1815.76 E:0.049617 |  and Johar comes out and narrows the angle.
[2536.40 - 2540.48] P:1888.83 E:0.046458 |  It looks like he's going to just open his foot and pass it into the far corner
[2540.48 - 2543.76] P:1858.86 E:0.046710 |  and Johar stays big, stops himself from being dinked as well
[2543.76 - 2544.96] P:1784.03 E:0.045624 |  and it's a brilliant save.
[2544.96 - 2547.12] P:1961.65 E:0.035062 |  Would have been checked by the video assistant referee, of course,
[2547.12 - 2550.64] P:2008.23 E:0.043413 |  Hattarte, first-time ball out to Jota. Jota dummies the cross.
[2550.64 - 2553.36] P:1918.22 E:0.042492 |  There's the step over, left-footed high, floated ball.
[2553.36 - 2556.08] P:1956.13 E:0.045811 |  Jack O'Mackess up so high, heads it back across goal.
[2556.08 - 2557.44] P:2010.06 E:0.038822 |  Courtois makes the catch.
[2557.44 - 2559.36] P:1986.78 E:0.046112 |  Jack O'Mackess penalised for a foul.
[2559.36 - 2562.64] P:1857.47 E:0.044496 |  Conomack-Namara watching Sevilla against Manchester City.
[2562.64 - 2564.72] P:1585.09 E:0.053088 |  Still Sevilla, Manchester City, wonderful.
[2564.72 - 2566.96] P:1560.18 E:0.053083 |  It's just pulled another one back, looking for Harland.
[2566.96 - 2568.08] P:1412.92 E:0.048086 |  It's been put out for a corner.
[2568.08 - 2570.00] P:1517.87 E:0.047589 |  Sevilla have had their best chance of the game.
[2570.00 - 2572.40] P:1574.67 E:0.051056 |  Papu Goli stretching, couldn't trouble Edison.
[2572.40 - 2573.68] P:1595.73 E:0.056044 |  It's Sevilla, City 1.
[2574.40 - 2580.16] P:1823.58 E:0.041199 |  AC Milan equaliser. Alexis Salamakers with it against Salzburg.
[2580.16 - 2583.04] P:1681.12 E:0.044168 |  That's Salzburg 1. AC Milan 1.
[2583.04 - 2586.80] P:1816.01 E:0.042058 |  Schachtar in this group still one up away to RB Leipzig.
[2586.88 - 2591.20] P:1698.42 E:0.040129 |  As Conom was saying, Manchester City leading Sevilla by Goulton.
[2591.20 - 2595.04] P:1765.47 E:0.043679 |  The expressive nature of Carlo Ancelotti, so annoyed with his team.
[2595.04 - 2597.04] P:1779.99 E:0.046020 |  I'm not quite sure what it was playing out from the back,
[2597.04 - 2599.04] P:1720.50 E:0.035907 |  but it's a giant clap of the hands,
[2599.04 - 2602.64] P:1742.70 E:0.045063 |  and the arms are thrown up in sort of operatic despair.
[2602.64 - 2605.52] P:1895.07 E:0.046111 |  Cross in from Carvajal, chested down by Jens.
[2605.52 - 2609.12] P:1785.24 E:0.042746 |  Callen McGregor head up all the time, looking for the early pass forward.
[2609.12 - 2611.68] P:1809.27 E:0.038359 |  It's not on, back it comes to Karta Vickers.
[2611.68 - 2612.48] P:1711.79 E:0.044157 |  Nil Nil.
[2612.48 - 2615.28] P:1686.02 E:0.046515 |  I'm just thinking about the cross from Jiranovic,
[2615.28 - 2617.76] P:1738.12 E:0.042640 |  not the last one, the one before it.
[2617.76 - 2620.32] P:1724.13 E:0.044002 |  It goes to the back post, and it's something that's silty,
[2621.12 - 2624.56] P:1661.48 E:0.045201 |  more often than not, the opposite wide man gets in
[2624.56 - 2625.84] P:1576.20 E:0.045195 |  and puts that in the back of the net.
[2625.84 - 2628.24] P:1796.70 E:0.046493 |  Jota's on his heels, if he goes and attacks it,
[2628.24 - 2629.60] P:1887.21 E:0.040498 |  then he's got a great chance.
[2629.60 - 2631.84] P:1949.56 E:0.043665 |  McGregor floated ball, chested down by Jota.
[2631.84 - 2634.00] P:1849.65 E:0.042395 |  The offside flag goes up late there.
[2634.00 - 2636.24] P:1824.42 E:0.046015 |  Play was allowed to develop, then it goes up.
[2636.24 - 2638.32] P:1896.41 E:0.045021 |  Jota was offside from the original ball,
[2638.88 - 2641.36] P:1801.68 E:0.043223 |  and once he back healed it to Matto Riley,
[2641.36 - 2643.92] P:1670.98 E:0.038724 |  the flag went up and the pre-kick is given to Real Madrid.
[2643.92 - 2646.80] P:1604.96 E:0.042870 |  We have a minute left in this first half.
[2646.80 - 2649.28] P:1681.63 E:0.044205 |  Kelly Cates back with you at half time,
[2649.28 - 2653.76] P:1915.08 E:0.044832 |  keeping you in touch with everything that's been going on this evening.
[2653.76 - 2655.28] P:1723.10 E:0.045358 |  Five live and BBC sound.
[2655.28 - 2657.84] P:1729.50 E:0.042802 |  This is Celtic Nil, Real Madrid Nil,
[2658.48 - 2661.44] P:1699.55 E:0.048046 |  Kroos on the ball inside his own half towards Hazard.
[2662.24 - 2663.68] P:1726.95 E:0.035972 |  Nearly got away from him.
[2663.68 - 2667.76] P:1751.32 E:0.040787 |  McGregor sticking to him like glue, plays back to Alaba.
[2668.80 - 2670.32] P:1829.76 E:0.049726 |  Alaba across to Militao.
[2671.20 - 2672.80] P:1728.28 E:0.051831 |  Militao to Carvajal,
[2672.80 - 2675.28] P:1782.23 E:0.046724 |  walking pace from Real Madrid inside their own half.
[2675.92 - 2678.48] P:1825.42 E:0.047161 |  Not really had too many stoppages in the first half.
[2678.48 - 2683.76] P:1703.33 E:0.038218 |  I wouldn't expect too much added time at the end of this 45 minutes.
[2683.76 - 2687.52] P:1496.41 E:0.039135 |  Luca Modric, always reminded of that goal.
[2687.52 - 2689.68] P:1824.41 E:0.044756 |  He scored, breaking Scottish arts
[2689.68 - 2692.72] P:1934.54 E:0.047979 |  against Scotland at Hamden Park in the Euros.
[2692.72 - 2694.64] P:2021.98 E:0.044852 |  That was a wonderful classic.
[2694.64 - 2695.60] P:1606.68 E:0.062036 |  I've just got all over that one.
[2695.60 - 2697.36] P:1955.32 E:0.039718 |  Sorry, Jack. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[2697.92 - 2699.20] P:1931.27 E:0.053280 |  Carvajal on the right,
[2699.20 - 2700.80] P:2032.45 E:0.039346 |  low ball to the edge of the Celtic box.
[2700.80 - 2704.96] P:2030.95 E:0.043035 |  Tua Mayny lays it off, Hazard drives a low pass to Venetius Junior.
[2704.96 - 2706.72] P:1991.99 E:0.047786 |  Right footed, Kirlis straight at Johar,
[2706.72 - 2708.24] P:1928.64 E:0.042637 |  pass it down into the ground,
[2708.24 - 2710.80] P:1864.63 E:0.043200 |  one minute of added time at the end of the first half.
[2710.80 - 2712.80] P:1936.50 E:0.038827 |  And again, Celtic are going to go quickly.
[2712.80 - 2716.56] P:1903.56 E:0.045537 |  Johar slings it out, Schmeichelstahl over on to Abad.
[2716.56 - 2719.20] P:1952.37 E:0.038314 |  Abad can't quite get past Tony Kroos.
[2719.20 - 2722.40] P:1886.52 E:0.035211 |  Kroos stops him and the ball comes back to Alaba.
[2722.40 - 2724.00] P:1851.37 E:0.036557 |  What a first half it's been.
[2724.00 - 2726.64] P:1817.07 E:0.046413 |  It's been incredible. Absolutely incredible.
[2726.64 - 2728.88] P:1776.20 E:0.046878 |  The noise at the start, the start for Celtic.
[2728.88 - 2731.68] P:1711.97 E:0.041647 |  Real Madrid have had the moments, the chances Celtic created.
[2732.56 - 2734.08] P:1704.66 E:0.049361 |  It's been absolutely brilliant.
[2734.08 - 2736.88] P:1784.28 E:0.041946 |  And everything we expected, more apart from,
[2736.88 - 2738.16] P:1789.01 E:0.031882 |  we've not seen too many goals.
[2738.16 - 2739.76] P:1807.37 E:0.042720 |  But as long as we look when the Celtic end,
[2739.76 - 2740.64] P:1620.70 E:0.051773 |  we'll be all right with that.
[2742.08 - 2744.56] P:1854.01 E:0.046030 |  Last chance in the first half, possibly for Real Madrid.
[2744.56 - 2747.92] P:1941.66 E:0.039087 |  Venetius Junior, Celtic defenders trailing in his wake,
[2747.92 - 2750.48] P:1979.89 E:0.045288 |  but they've got him heading backwards towards the halfway line.
[2750.48 - 2753.20] P:2087.25 E:0.044635 |  10 seconds remaining on the clock in the first half.
[2753.20 - 2755.68] P:2164.36 E:0.044308 |  Will Real Madrid sling across in there?
[2755.68 - 2757.92] P:2183.48 E:0.043722 |  Valverde with a couple of tricks on the right-hand side.
[2757.92 - 2759.52] P:2184.68 E:0.045803 |  It's not really their style.
[2759.52 - 2761.84] P:2099.54 E:0.044576 |  They've not really got the target man either,
[2761.84 - 2765.28] P:1973.32 E:0.050754 |  with Karim Benzema going off injured at half-time.
[2765.28 - 2767.60] P:2031.23 E:0.047797 |  Carlo Ancelotti, not best plays with his team.
[2767.60 - 2771.28] P:2039.86 E:0.044513 |  Another throw of the arm in the air.
[2771.28 - 2774.16] P:1963.67 E:0.047307 |  The European champions have come to Celtic Park
[2774.16 - 2776.72] P:1950.35 E:0.039035 |  and James McFadden, they know they're in a fight.
[2776.72 - 2777.60] P:1896.36 E:0.055766 |  Oh, they sure do.
[2778.24 - 2780.00] P:1861.82 E:0.049493 |  Carlo Ancelotti's frustrated, we say,
[2780.00 - 2781.52] P:1649.23 E:0.049409 |  but I think, Fred, it has to go to Celtic
[2781.52 - 2783.68] P:1838.78 E:0.043066 |  and how they've played and how they've approached it.
[2783.68 - 2786.64] P:1938.10 E:0.042803 |  Pressing, when it's on, sitting back, frustrating.
[2786.72 - 2788.88] P:1758.69 E:0.049803 |  Alowing Real Madrid possession of the ball,
[2788.88 - 2790.80] P:1714.75 E:0.042814 |  allowing them to go side-to-side,
[2790.80 - 2793.76] P:1869.89 E:0.045141 |  ensuring they've looked dangerous in certain occasions,
[2793.76 - 2796.24] P:1860.04 E:0.049080 |  but overall, I think Celtic will be really happy
[2796.24 - 2797.52] P:1869.07 E:0.046426 |  with how that first half's gone.
[2797.52 - 2799.28] P:2108.08 E:0.044074 |  Half-time thoughts from Ruddy Poseid.
[2799.28 - 2800.96] P:2013.40 E:0.050517 |  Well, I'm looking at the possession stats.
[2800.96 - 2803.20] P:1941.53 E:0.045675 |  Celtic have 57% of the possession,
[2803.20 - 2805.68] P:1944.69 E:0.045515 |  that's their lowest share this season.
[2805.68 - 2808.00] P:1979.66 E:0.044709 |  The only other team who finished a game
[2808.00 - 2810.96] P:1838.49 E:0.047130 |  with greater possession than them was Rangers on Saturday,
[2810.96 - 2813.12] P:1862.31 E:0.043419 |  and Celtic took care of business when they needed.
[2813.12 - 2815.36] P:1916.94 E:0.048849 |  At the moment, also, by the way,
[2815.36 - 2817.28] P:1939.13 E:0.047651 |  two shots on target, plus hitting the post.
[2817.28 - 2817.60] P:1959.50 E:0.036848 |  Yeah.
[2817.60 - 2819.20] P:1888.53 E:0.047018 |  There's a feeling on that, too,
[2819.20 - 2821.28] P:1946.10 E:0.049004 |  because Real's only chance on target
[2821.28 - 2822.56] P:1924.02 E:0.038144 |  came right at the end of the half.
[2822.56 - 2825.68] P:2027.37 E:0.045876 |  Can Celtic keep it going in the second half?
[2825.68 - 2828.56] P:1969.66 E:0.045925 |  Carlo Ancelotti, this is his fourth visit to Celtic Park.
[2828.56 - 2830.56] P:1973.39 E:0.042245 |  He doesn't like it, he's never won.
[2830.56 - 2832.40] P:2010.64 E:0.042403 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil.
[2832.96 - 2835.92] P:1734.51 E:0.052742 |  James, this is such a fun game to watch.
[2835.92 - 2838.40] P:1862.00 E:0.046117 |  It's end-to-end, it's really entertaining,
[2838.40 - 2840.80] P:1783.84 E:0.047355 |  and as much as, you know, Ruddy was right to say,
[2840.80 - 2843.36] P:1864.02 E:0.041791 |  with just over 30% of possession for Celtic,
[2843.92 - 2846.40] P:1840.58 E:0.047752 |  but it seems to feel like every time they've got the ball,
[2846.40 - 2847.76] P:1928.91 E:0.035416 |  they're going forward.
[2847.76 - 2848.96] P:1749.54 E:0.051027 |  Yeah, and that is it.
[2848.96 - 2853.04] P:1993.47 E:0.035129 |  You know, Celtic, when they play against, you know,
[2853.04 - 2856.24] P:1895.38 E:0.041573 |  and domestic teams, they have majority of the ball
[2856.24 - 2857.52] P:1809.12 E:0.043410 |  because teams are sitting off,
[2857.52 - 2858.72] P:1807.01 E:0.036016 |  they're not committing to the press,
[2858.72 - 2862.00] P:1874.45 E:0.039789 |  so they're patient, and they have to try and look for those gaps,
[2862.00 - 2863.76] P:1978.72 E:0.036777 |  try and invite the press.
[2863.76 - 2865.84] P:1947.35 E:0.044164 |  But as Ruddy mentioned, against Rangers,
[2865.84 - 2868.56] P:1917.97 E:0.042174 |  Rangers went to go and try and have a go at Celtic,
[2868.56 - 2870.32] P:1846.55 E:0.051149 |  and they just sat off at times as well,
[2870.40 - 2873.60] P:1916.96 E:0.044808 |  and allowed, I wouldn't say they allowed them comfortable possession,
[2873.60 - 2875.28] P:1809.80 E:0.036865 |  but when Celtic went it back,
[2875.28 - 2877.36] P:2022.95 E:0.044756 |  two, three, four, five passes,
[2877.36 - 2878.64] P:1769.08 E:0.044995 |  and they're getting a chance at goal
[2878.64 - 2880.72] P:1901.12 E:0.040942 |  because of the speed in which they attack,
[2880.72 - 2882.08] P:1853.50 E:0.045265 |  the numbers they throw forward,
[2882.72 - 2884.88] P:1949.38 E:0.042547 |  and how quick they play the ball forward
[2884.88 - 2888.64] P:1931.49 E:0.039100 |  when it's restarted, they want to play and put teams under pressure.
[2888.64 - 2890.56] P:1865.37 E:0.039280 |  They're not going to have the majority of possession
[2890.56 - 2891.36] P:1930.87 E:0.043897 |  against Real Madrid,
[2891.36 - 2893.28] P:1838.43 E:0.037444 |  because they know how to take this thing out of the game,
[2893.28 - 2896.80] P:1898.24 E:0.046279 |  but I would say that Anshborst of Corg Lugl will be absolutely delighted
[2896.80 - 2898.32] P:1939.34 E:0.043663 |  with how this first half's gone.
[2898.32 - 2900.00] P:1995.10 E:0.042074 |  They've had the best chances in the game,
[2900.08 - 2901.20] P:2024.32 E:0.036666 |  they've hit the post,
[2901.20 - 2903.44] P:1855.57 E:0.042731 |  and yeah, Real Madrid have looked at a class at times
[2903.44 - 2905.12] P:1898.90 E:0.037226 |  in terms of not having a ball about,
[2905.12 - 2907.12] P:1929.67 E:0.048039 |  but not really testing Joe Hart,
[2907.12 - 2909.60] P:1989.95 E:0.043299 |  Vinicius goes in down the left-hand side,
[2909.60 - 2910.64] P:2015.97 E:0.049040 |  Joe Hart does really well,
[2910.64 - 2912.16] P:1946.42 E:0.038487 |  there's another shot from distance,
[2912.16 - 2914.24] P:1714.57 E:0.044703 |  but apart from that, I think they'll be really happy.
[2914.24 - 2916.00] P:2038.31 E:0.044871 |  The frustration for Celtic is they haven't been able
[2916.00 - 2917.20] P:1859.03 E:0.041907 |  to take one of those chances,
[2917.20 - 2919.12] P:1872.05 E:0.040380 |  but when they've been on the ball,
[2919.12 - 2921.20] P:1863.79 E:0.049005 |  they've used it the way they normally do,
[2921.20 - 2923.36] P:1983.89 E:0.041490 |  and that is all the Celtic fans,
[2923.36 - 2924.80] P:1880.46 E:0.046110 |  Anshborst of Corg Lugl, the players,
[2924.80 - 2926.00] P:1958.58 E:0.043246 |  it's all they can ask for,
[2926.00 - 2927.92] P:1967.22 E:0.044841 |  because they promised them they would approach the game
[2927.92 - 2930.16] P:1952.69 E:0.044097 |  in the same manner as they should do every single week,
[2930.16 - 2931.68] P:1770.02 E:0.042151 |  and they certainly have done that.
[2931.68 - 2934.24] P:1732.78 E:0.048539 |  It is very much Anshborst of Corg Lugl's ethos
[2934.24 - 2936.00] P:1692.52 E:0.041125 |  on the pitch at Celtic Park tonight.
[2936.00 - 2937.36] P:1649.14 E:0.044007 |  We'll be back there for the second half
[2937.36 - 2939.12] P:1690.36 E:0.039677 |  with James McFadden, Roddy Forsythe,
[2939.12 - 2941.60] P:1869.31 E:0.042602 |  and Alistair Bruce Ball very shortly.
[2941.60 - 2943.52] P:1596.64 E:0.048667 |  Also half-time in Seville,
[2943.52 - 2946.40] P:1595.76 E:0.042569 |  it's Sevilla against Manchester City, Conor McNamara.
[2946.40 - 2948.80] P:1818.37 E:0.049062 |  Yes, it's been comfortable for Pep Guardiola's side,
[2948.80 - 2950.88] P:1591.50 E:0.044150 |  they lead by a goal to Nill here,
[2950.88 - 2953.60] P:1645.29 E:0.051348 |  it is now 11 goals in his last seven games
[2953.60 - 2955.84] P:1584.68 E:0.047248 |  for Manchester City for Erling Haaland,
[2956.08 - 2958.32] P:1674.21 E:0.048350 |  sliding in, tapping it in, looks so easy.
[2958.32 - 2961.20] P:1653.53 E:0.047838 |  Of course, the genius is how he got into that position
[2961.20 - 2963.20] P:1608.97 E:0.045071 |  how he gave the defenders the slip.
[2963.20 - 2966.24] P:1601.54 E:0.043970 |  Kevin De Bruyne, perfectly timing a run to stay onside,
[2966.24 - 2968.16] P:1645.19 E:0.040637 |  getting on to Phil Foden's pass,
[2968.16 - 2969.44] P:1664.63 E:0.048967 |  low and hard across the goal,
[2969.44 - 2971.04] P:1690.16 E:0.044773 |  and Haaland there to tap it in.
[2971.04 - 2974.32] P:1543.84 E:0.047141 |  So, 20th game for Haaland in the Champions League in his career,
[2974.32 - 2975.60] P:1756.82 E:0.045273 |  he loves this competition,
[2975.60 - 2979.04] P:1707.35 E:0.044093 |  he's now scored 24 goals in those 20 games.
[2979.04 - 2981.28] P:1626.83 E:0.046138 |  At this level, it's just incredible.
[2981.28 - 2983.28] P:1527.88 E:0.049452 |  Sevilla promised much in the opening minutes,
[2983.28 - 2984.64] P:1679.53 E:0.051545 |  they were a flurry of passes,
[2984.64 - 2986.80] P:1370.30 E:0.049356 |  they were confidently coming out from the back,
[2986.80 - 2988.32] P:1469.98 E:0.049728 |  but they haven't delivered much.
[2988.32 - 2990.72] P:1405.50 E:0.051718 |  Marcus Secunia, the Argentinian midfielder,
[2990.72 - 2992.24] P:1293.18 E:0.055130 |  and a crack from the edge of the box,
[2992.24 - 2994.88] P:1454.18 E:0.051488 |  but it went across the face of goal and narrowly wide.
[2994.88 - 2997.52] P:1518.04 E:0.050057 |  It is Sevilla Nill, Manchester City won.
[2997.52 - 2999.44] P:1330.67 E:0.048619 |  Conor, thank you very much, Conor McNamara,
[2999.44 - 3001.84] P:1451.38 E:0.044690 |  I'll bring us regular updates from that game.
[3001.84 - 3005.60] P:1789.69 E:0.042002 |  England are taking on Luxembourg in the qualifiers for the World Cup,
[3005.60 - 3006.80] P:1328.51 E:0.039471 |  England have of course already qualified
[3006.80 - 3009.20] P:1773.92 E:0.045615 |  with that win against Austria in midweek,
[3009.20 - 3012.96] P:1667.86 E:0.042258 |  but Serena Wiegman said they weren't going to take their foot off the gas for this one.
[3013.04 - 3015.44] P:1649.22 E:0.047469 |  So how many is it now, Gary Flintoff?
[3015.44 - 3020.48] P:1843.84 E:0.045995 |  Well, we've played an hour, Kelly, it's England 7, Luxembourg 0,
[3020.48 - 3022.72] P:1593.68 E:0.047042 |  and I have to say, very popular goal,
[3022.72 - 3025.68] P:1971.90 E:0.036381 |  just scored by Nikita Paris.
[3025.68 - 3027.12] P:1720.18 E:0.048182 |  Good run on the right-hand side,
[3027.12 - 3029.20] P:1747.39 E:0.043699 |  neat 1-2 into the penalty area,
[3029.20 - 3032.16] P:1924.20 E:0.040688 |  and she finished low past the keeper's right hand.
[3032.16 - 3037.12] P:1835.45 E:0.043459 |  And as expected, the changes have come three at half time with Zellem,
[3037.12 - 3038.96] P:1829.88 E:0.047449 |  as the goalkeeper makes another save.
[3038.96 - 3041.76] P:1854.54 E:0.043353 |  Zellem, England and Bright coming on for Williamson,
[3041.76 - 3046.88] P:1915.44 E:0.044181 |  Stamway and Russo, and Hemp and Stokes have just replaced Daly and Mead,
[3046.88 - 3049.04] P:1945.15 E:0.044366 |  as Serena Wiegman makes changes
[3049.04 - 3052.16] P:1900.98 E:0.043132 |  and starts to experiment England in control,
[3052.16 - 3054.88] P:1830.99 E:0.033863 |  as you would expect by seven goals to nil.
[3054.88 - 3056.32] P:1743.22 E:0.040315 |  Gary Flintoff, thank you very much,
[3056.32 - 3057.92] P:1685.42 E:0.043719 |  Gary will keep you up to date with that,
[3057.92 - 3062.00] P:1642.28 E:0.036865 |  and Laura Bassett and P. Mirlenstein will take you through that on Sports Extra
[3062.00 - 3064.24] P:1995.16 E:0.030124 |  if you want to listen to full commentary.
[3064.24 - 3066.96] P:1436.11 E:0.041400 |  Elsewhere in terms of the World Cup qualifiers,
[3066.96 - 3069.44] P:1891.37 E:0.043366 |  Wales are drawing nil-nil against Slovenia,
[3069.44 - 3072.08] P:1819.93 E:0.036185 |  Wales need a point to make the playoffs,
[3072.08 - 3074.40] P:1850.22 E:0.029028 |  it's going well for them as things stand.
[3074.40 - 3077.36] P:1632.37 E:0.040861 |  Earlier Scotland made it six against the Faroe Island,
[3077.36 - 3079.36] P:1774.50 E:0.026976 |  six nil was the final score there,
[3079.36 - 3083.76] P:1867.54 E:0.036654 |  and Northern Ireland beat Latvia in Latvia by three goals to one.
[3083.76 - 3085.76] P:1894.45 E:0.043729 |  Elsewhere in the Champions League this evening,
[3085.76 - 3088.56] P:1493.81 E:0.040701 |  John Bennett, it's been entertaining, it's been eventful.
[3088.56 - 3090.24] P:1508.91 E:0.045706 |  We've seen some fantastic goals,
[3090.24 - 3093.84] P:1686.59 E:0.045253 |  two of them in Paris, both scored by Kylian Mbappe.
[3093.84 - 3097.60] P:1876.15 E:0.045337 |  Half time it is Paris Saint-Germain 2, Juventus nil,
[3097.60 - 3100.80] P:1776.78 E:0.045855 |  the first goal will be sending social media wild,
[3100.80 - 3103.60] P:1761.82 E:0.040559 |  a scoop pass by Neymar into the box,
[3103.60 - 3107.12] P:1406.54 E:0.045222 |  and Mbappe volleyed it in, his second goal was a volley as well,
[3107.12 - 3112.00] P:1746.24 E:0.039152 |  this time set up by Hakimi, Paris Saint-Germain playing some superb football.
[3112.00 - 3113.44] P:1864.64 E:0.045717 |  Elsewhere in Celtics group,
[3113.44 - 3116.40] P:1716.72 E:0.045682 |  there's a really good story developing in Germany,
[3116.40 - 3119.60] P:1840.59 E:0.042815 |  RB Leipzig nil, Schachtar Donetsk won,
[3119.60 - 3122.80] P:1657.50 E:0.039049 |  it's incredible that Schachtar are able to compete in the Champions League,
[3122.80 - 3124.64] P:1633.05 E:0.040741 |  given what's going on in Ukraine,
[3124.72 - 3128.64] P:1665.14 E:0.047052 |  let alone to be winning this game at half time a bizarre goal.
[3128.64 - 3130.88] P:1851.93 E:0.044849 |  Marian Schved hitting it into an empty net
[3130.88 - 3133.44] P:1405.91 E:0.043125 |  after he dispossessed the goalkeeper who was well out of his box,
[3133.44 - 3135.84] P:1895.39 E:0.036730 |  but they're one nil up Schachtar Donetsk.
[3135.84 - 3138.32] P:1904.25 E:0.043596 |  And finally in Chelsea's group half time,
[3138.32 - 3142.08] P:1545.82 E:0.048969 |  it's Red Bull Salzburg won, AC Milan won, Milan with an equaliser,
[3142.08 - 3145.76] P:1687.16 E:0.042674 |  after another brilliant goal, Noah Oka 4 with two nutmegs
[3145.76 - 3149.12] P:1188.77 E:0.032657 |  as he hit the back of the net, but it's Salzburg won, AC Milan won.
[3149.12 - 3150.96] P:1599.14 E:0.040541 |  John, thank you very much, John Bennett keeping an eye
[3150.96 - 3153.44] P:1840.17 E:0.042038 |  on all things Champions League this evening.
[3153.44 - 3156.08] P:1371.47 E:0.049301 |  There is a match towards the bottom of League one as well,
[3156.08 - 3160.88] P:1570.41 E:0.039079 |  Forest Green Rovers, one nil up against Aquington Stanley.
[3160.88 - 3163.04] P:1756.75 E:0.042002 |  We'll keep you up to date with all of this evening's football,
[3163.04 - 3165.28] P:1530.66 E:0.039705 |  but for now we're going to head back to New York,
[3165.28 - 3167.36] P:1609.88 E:0.044887 |  the quarterfinals are underway at the US Open,
[3167.36 - 3168.72] P:1323.83 E:0.042836 |  and David Law is watching.
[3169.60 - 3172.72] P:1607.96 E:0.041403 |  And we know who our first men's quarterfinalist is,
[3172.72 - 3174.32] P:1661.42 E:0.047337 |  that's going to be Casparud,
[3174.32 - 3177.76] P:1808.54 E:0.048808 |  who also reached the final of the French Open a few months ago.
[3177.76 - 3181.20] P:1772.36 E:0.051484 |  He's from Norway and he defeated Matteo Berettini of Italy,
[3181.20 - 3183.52] P:1746.42 E:0.047526 |  a Wimbledon runner-up of last year.
[3183.52 - 3185.60] P:1786.86 E:0.048778 |  Terrible start to the match for Berettini,
[3185.60 - 3188.48] P:1753.30 E:0.048225 |  he only won two games in the first couple of sets,
[3188.48 - 3190.00] P:1702.07 E:0.042674 |  got himself back into it,
[3190.00 - 3192.24] P:1779.98 E:0.047584 |  but rude eventually won through in four sets,
[3192.24 - 3194.24] P:1767.23 E:0.048138 |  and will now face either Nick Kiriosl,
[3194.24 - 3196.64] P:1814.95 E:0.043553 |  Karen Hachanov in the semi-finals.
[3196.64 - 3199.04] P:1509.26 E:0.047443 |  We also got the first of the women's quarterfinals
[3199.04 - 3199.84] P:1218.80 E:0.050478 |  going on at the moment,
[3199.84 - 3202.32] P:1724.43 E:0.044571 |  Once Gibur, a runner-up at Wimbledon this year,
[3202.32 - 3205.68] P:1652.26 E:0.049462 |  5-3 up first set against the woman who knocked out Serena Williams
[3205.68 - 3207.68] P:1604.50 E:0.045361 |  at this tournament, that's Ayla Tomlanovic.
[3207.68 - 3212.16] P:1816.65 E:0.043980 |  5-3 Gibur, it is and now our advantage to Tomlanovic.
[3212.16 - 3213.68] P:1746.53 E:0.041476 |  David Law, thank you very much.
[3213.68 - 3215.28] P:1605.53 E:0.040574 |  Live commentary from Flushing Meadows
[3215.28 - 3217.92] P:1277.66 E:0.036683 |  is available on the BBC Sport website and app.
[3218.48 - 3220.64] P:1401.70 E:0.044224 |  Coming up, we will of course be back at Celtic Park
[3220.64 - 3223.36] P:1740.93 E:0.039867 |  for the second half of Celtic against Real Madrid,
[3223.36 - 3224.80] P:1668.36 E:0.045051 |  really entertaining first half,
[3224.80 - 3226.32] P:1736.04 E:0.040307 |  but no goals as yet.
[3226.32 - 3228.96] P:1738.41 E:0.037795 |  Regular updates from the Champions League as well,
[3228.96 - 3230.96] P:1449.31 E:0.043447 |  and from England's World Cup qualifier
[3230.96 - 3234.48] P:1562.96 E:0.038736 |  against Luxembourg where the Lionesses are rampant
[3234.48 - 3236.72] P:1796.53 E:0.033574 |  and in stoke this evening.
[3236.72 - 3238.56] P:1448.33 E:0.047856 |  We'll also be live in Naples with Ian Dennis,
[3238.56 - 3241.28] P:1888.35 E:0.038462 |  ahead of Liverpool's Champions League opener tomorrow.
[3241.28 - 3243.68] P:1510.20 E:0.029634 |  Before all of that though, the BBC News with Lucky Bone.
[3244.80 - 3250.48] P:1508.98 E:0.057809 |  Listen on BBC Sounds, this is BBC Radio 5 Live.
[3250.48 - 3252.72] P:1584.99 E:0.044179 |  Thanks Kelly, Liz Truss is appointing ministers
[3252.72 - 3254.72] P:1537.89 E:0.041812 |  to her first cabinet as Prime Minister.
[3254.72 - 3258.32] P:1912.88 E:0.042124 |  Earlier she delivered her first speech from outside Downing Street,
[3258.32 - 3261.12] P:1707.45 E:0.041312 |  saying she had three immediate priorities for her government,
[3261.12 - 3263.36] P:1481.25 E:0.041626 |  to grow the economy, tackle the energy crisis,
[3263.36 - 3265.60] P:1710.49 E:0.039586 |  and improve access to the NHS.
[3265.60 - 3269.20] P:1713.41 E:0.044274 |  So who will be helping her in trying to deliver on those priorities?
[3269.20 - 3272.64] P:1609.21 E:0.043826 |  Her political correspondent Ioni Wells is outside Downing Street.
[3272.64 - 3274.56] P:1588.91 E:0.038912 |  Ioni, who have the big jobs gone to?
[3276.16 - 3278.96] P:1685.55 E:0.043072 |  Well, some of the top jobs as you say have already been announced.
[3278.96 - 3282.40] P:1642.02 E:0.045112 |  We know that Kwasi Kwateng is going to be the new Chancellor,
[3282.40 - 3285.12] P:1749.51 E:0.043533 |  that Suella Braverman is going to be the new Home Secretary,
[3285.12 - 3288.88] P:1925.91 E:0.045272 |  James Cleverly going to be the new Foreign Secretary as well.
[3288.88 - 3291.84] P:1550.38 E:0.048200 |  Nadine Zahawi as well, still remaining a Cabinet Minister.
[3291.84 - 3294.16] P:1930.26 E:0.044539 |  He's going to be the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
[3294.16 - 3297.04] P:1609.36 E:0.039362 |  which is essentially responsible for running the Cabinet Office
[3297.04 - 3298.64] P:1477.26 E:0.039826 |  and supporting the Prime Minister,
[3298.64 - 3301.44] P:1543.01 E:0.038090 |  basically trying to get different departments and government
[3301.44 - 3303.44] P:1955.72 E:0.037449 |  to try and work together better.
[3304.16 - 3305.60] P:1518.13 E:0.037688 |  So that's another sort of key role.
[3305.60 - 3309.04] P:1741.51 E:0.041380 |  We also know Brandon Lewis has gone from being Northern Ireland Secretary
[3309.04 - 3311.28] P:1847.06 E:0.035869 |  to Justice Secretary as well.
[3311.28 - 3313.60] P:1743.87 E:0.042963 |  So a couple of key big names there as well.
[3313.60 - 3315.36] P:1829.93 E:0.035564 |  Health Secretary going to Therese Coffey,
[3315.36 - 3318.48] P:1707.23 E:0.042714 |  who's a close friend and ally of Liz Truss as well.
[3318.48 - 3320.72] P:1555.57 E:0.037853 |  She's also going to be Deputy Prime Minister.
[3320.72 - 3323.76] P:1610.80 E:0.044176 |  Now one key appointment as well is Wendy Morton.
[3323.76 - 3325.76] P:1522.98 E:0.037891 |  Now people may have not heard that name before,
[3325.76 - 3327.44] P:2136.20 E:0.043195 |  but she is going to be the new Chief Whip,
[3327.44 - 3329.28] P:1778.64 E:0.036608 |  which is a very important role,
[3329.28 - 3333.60] P:1731.94 E:0.037799 |  essentially tasked with making Tory MPs vote the way
[3333.60 - 3336.24] P:1491.95 E:0.043379 |  that the Prime Minister wants them to vote in key things,
[3336.24 - 3338.80] P:1520.99 E:0.045220 |  but also in charge of things like MPs welfare
[3338.80 - 3340.72] P:1520.93 E:0.045518 |  and party discipline more generally as well.
[3340.72 - 3344.80] P:1589.04 E:0.036918 |  Now she is the first Conservative woman to hold that post.
[3345.44 - 3347.28] P:1631.40 E:0.040276 |  So that's something that has been noted.
[3347.28 - 3350.40] P:1371.91 E:0.042220 |  It's previously been held by men in the last couple of governments,
[3351.12 - 3352.32] P:1366.89 E:0.047205 |  certainly as well.
[3352.32 - 3355.76] P:1528.66 E:0.039561 |  Lots of people commenting on the sort of diversity of those top jobs too.
[3355.76 - 3358.88] P:1586.10 E:0.040591 |  Not a single white man is going to hold a position
[3358.88 - 3360.88] P:1357.75 E:0.039726 |  in those four great offices of state.
[3360.88 - 3364.24] P:1504.44 E:0.037116 |  So another sort of top line to come out of this evening's appointments.
[3364.24 - 3365.92] P:1147.92 E:0.054598 |  And you mentioned allies there.
[3365.92 - 3369.44] P:1383.20 E:0.045482 |  What about the MPs who backed her opponent Rishi Sunak for the top job?
[3369.44 - 3370.08] P:875.07 E:0.057170 |  How have they felt?
[3371.12 - 3373.36] P:1523.27 E:0.043186 |  So far not very well at all.
[3373.36 - 3376.96] P:1500.86 E:0.038446 |  And that is something that is being picked up on in political circles
[3376.96 - 3379.44] P:1554.09 E:0.046946 |  among MPs that did back Rishi Sunak
[3380.00 - 3382.40] P:1687.38 E:0.036459 |  other leadership candidates in this race.
[3382.40 - 3385.52] P:1518.07 E:0.035871 |  Now if this goes the way that we expect it to go,
[3385.52 - 3387.28] P:1767.79 E:0.040354 |  there could still be last minute changes
[3387.28 - 3389.44] P:1545.21 E:0.043724 |  or kind of grappling over certain roles.
[3389.44 - 3393.20] P:1630.97 E:0.039918 |  But so far the only person tipped to be in a cabinet position
[3393.20 - 3395.60] P:1679.13 E:0.039690 |  who backed Rishi Sunak is Michael Ellis,
[3395.60 - 3397.76] P:1613.98 E:0.034142 |  who's tipped to be Attorney General,
[3397.76 - 3399.76] P:1300.18 E:0.038106 |  a legal advisor for the government.
[3400.56 - 3404.72] P:1450.72 E:0.042451 |  But so far no other Rishi Sunak supporters are being given top roles.
[3404.72 - 3407.92] P:1725.85 E:0.036216 |  Now where that could kind of prove problematic is
[3407.92 - 3410.16] P:1334.56 E:0.039685 |  this is something Boris Johnson was known for as well,
[3410.16 - 3413.20] P:1611.62 E:0.039510 |  kind of pointing key allies to those top cabinet positions.
[3414.00 - 3416.24] P:1610.67 E:0.040352 |  Where it may prove problematic though
[3416.24 - 3419.36] P:1403.37 E:0.040673 |  is that there have been calls over the last 24 hours
[3419.36 - 3422.48] P:1375.58 E:0.045667 |  for unity after what's been quite a bruising contest
[3422.48 - 3425.92] P:1721.97 E:0.039599 |  full of lots of blue on blue attacks within the Conservative Party.
[3425.92 - 3430.64] P:1585.75 E:0.042505 |  So there are some of his allies wondering why there aren't more of those positions
[3430.64 - 3433.84] P:1687.02 E:0.041133 |  being offered to Sunak supporters who could potentially then
[3434.56 - 3436.96] P:1452.32 E:0.043979 |  think about stitching some of those wounds back together.
[3436.96 - 3440.16] P:1658.97 E:0.045015 |  Ioni, thanks very much. In other news, the Scottish government has announced
[3440.16 - 3442.88] P:1414.92 E:0.047683 |  a series of measures to help people struggling to make ends meet.
[3442.88 - 3446.48] P:1607.74 E:0.041773 |  They include a freeze on rents for both social and private tenants
[3446.48 - 3448.72] P:1697.90 E:0.038297 |  and a temporary ban on evictions, Kelly.
[3449.84 - 3453.28] P:1291.18 E:0.060040 |  This is Five Live, your football station.
[3453.28 - 3456.80] P:1703.80 E:0.058896 |  The UEFA Champions League with Kelly Cates.
[3456.80 - 3461.28] P:1499.08 E:0.045600 |  And we will have second half commentary of Celtic against Ray El Madrid very shortly.
[3461.28 - 3463.76] P:1672.29 E:0.039542 |  Tomorrow we've got back-to-back games for you.
[3463.84 - 3469.04] P:1685.61 E:0.039140 |  Ajax against Rangers at 5.45 and Napoli against Liverpool at 8 o'clock.
[3469.04 - 3473.92] P:1697.80 E:0.041139 |  And on Saturday, Premier League afternoons on Five Live are back and bigger than ever.
[3475.52 - 3478.64] P:1722.88 E:0.051382 |  Listen to that roar. All the goals as they go in.
[3478.64 - 3481.28] P:1679.81 E:0.049821 |  Quicker than anything else you will find anywhere.
[3481.28 - 3483.52] P:1846.54 E:0.051191 |  That frenetic Five Live goal service.
[3484.16 - 3487.36] P:1632.65 E:0.044530 |  Stuff it. Just give me the team. He's a miserable lump.
[3487.36 - 3490.24] P:1505.92 E:0.061589 |  Oh, they've scored! On the wood!
[3490.24 - 3492.16] P:1452.06 E:0.062762 |  That really is rubbing it in now.
[3492.16 - 3493.44] P:1460.42 E:0.053048 |  Wow, taking all that in.
[3493.44 - 3497.12] P:1453.89 E:0.047086 |  Big game. Top on the guess who's muscled himself in.
[3497.12 - 3499.52] P:1339.68 E:0.051792 |  It's always a delight to be with you on a Saturday afternoon.
[3499.52 - 3500.80] P:1932.73 E:0.042400 |  Have you know who he really enjoys?
[3500.80 - 3502.00] P:1438.84 E:0.056648 |  Who outmanned it.
[3502.00 - 3502.88] P:1725.55 E:0.048101 |  Can you believe that?
[3502.88 - 3504.48] P:1608.68 E:0.058280 |  Just listen to that noise!
[3504.48 - 3507.52] P:1692.46 E:0.052105 |  It is. Oldham Five, Forest Green Five.
[3507.52 - 3509.44] P:1385.69 E:0.049069 |  Let's deal with the big story of the week then.
[3509.44 - 3510.80] P:1455.34 E:0.050233 |  You met Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[3511.76 - 3514.24] P:1482.83 E:0.053339 |  I mean, I didn't really know what. Is it Hello Arnie, how are you?
[3515.20 - 3516.88] P:1670.67 E:0.052219 |  I'm Arnie Scherer from Newcastle.
[3516.88 - 3518.08] P:1373.20 E:0.058772 |  Now, what about this?
[3518.16 - 3522.56] P:1643.15 E:0.060215 |  Christian Ericsson has just scored his first goal since his return.
[3522.56 - 3524.88] P:1634.87 E:0.051458 |  They're rattling in the goals and they're racking up the point.
[3524.88 - 3529.04] P:1681.28 E:0.062589 |  Rodrigo steps up and saves Jose Sardar the runway.
[3529.04 - 3530.80] P:1466.20 E:0.052905 |  Did Manchester United any chance?
[3530.80 - 3531.28] P:1749.46 E:0.039030 |  No.
[3531.28 - 3533.52] P:1597.76 E:0.056585 |  Thank you very much for the young bit. We'll see you next week.
[3533.52 - 3536.64] P:1690.59 E:0.058555 |  The goalkeeper has run 100 yards upfield
[3536.64 - 3538.80] P:1659.19 E:0.056530 |  to celebrate with the rest of his teammates.
[3538.80 - 3540.64] P:1661.38 E:0.053178 |  There's a metric called expected goals.
[3540.64 - 3541.68] P:1708.87 E:0.055123 |  Have you looked into that at all?
[3541.68 - 3542.88] P:1453.82 E:0.048154 |  I haven't looked into that now.
[3542.88 - 3544.40] P:1471.93 E:0.057944 |  I've looked into that for the first question.
[3544.40 - 3546.24] P:1533.25 E:0.054707 |  I really am enjoying working with you.
[3548.40 - 3550.00] P:1728.62 E:0.041205 |  It's going to be a long afternoon, isn't it?
[3550.80 - 3553.28] P:1517.99 E:0.047955 |  That was Mark Chapman and the voice of Saturday,
[3553.28 - 3555.68] P:1924.43 E:0.049738 |  Ian Dennis joins us now from Napoli.
[3556.32 - 3558.40] P:1596.12 E:0.050747 |  Buenos Aires, you're in a tunnel.
[3559.28 - 3560.48] P:1383.34 E:0.019403 |  Buenos Aires, ladies.
[3560.48 - 3563.04] P:1484.41 E:0.036749 |  It could be a long night for you if this cuts out.
[3563.04 - 3564.56] P:1458.97 E:0.032228 |  We've just left the stadium.
[3564.56 - 3567.92] P:1332.90 E:0.038322 |  We're just going into a tunnel on the chaotic roads of Naples.
[3568.64 - 3572.08] P:1328.90 E:0.034032 |  Having had a listen to Alison and Joerke and Klopp
[3572.08 - 3574.96] P:1196.58 E:0.029689 |  for about half an hour and then trying to flag down a taxi
[3574.96 - 3576.40] P:1275.66 E:0.024214 |  for another half an hour.
[3576.72 - 3577.68] P:1560.11 E:0.049120 |  What did they say?
[3577.68 - 3579.76] P:1384.36 E:0.048904 |  You've had plenty of time to mull over it.
[3579.76 - 3581.60] P:1551.69 E:0.039027 |  Are there any fit midfielders for Liverpool?
[3582.56 - 3584.48] P:1605.60 E:0.038563 |  Yeah, Thiago is trained today.
[3584.48 - 3586.08] P:1588.53 E:0.030010 |  It was his second day of training.
[3586.08 - 3588.72] P:1445.61 E:0.036596 |  So he's ready according to Joerke and Klopp.
[3589.44 - 3591.44] P:1633.27 E:0.023484 |  Curtis Jones hasn't travelled.
[3591.44 - 3592.56] P:1309.93 E:0.035169 |  Cavalio hasn't travelled.
[3592.56 - 3593.68] P:1350.07 E:0.028856 |  He's got a dead leg.
[3593.68 - 3596.00] P:1468.15 E:0.034552 |  Curtis Jones has just had a bit of a setback.
[3596.00 - 3597.36] P:1481.56 E:0.031746 |  But there's no Jordan Henderson.
[3597.36 - 3599.44] P:1641.92 E:0.031348 |  And the results of his scallop come back.
[3599.44 - 3601.44] P:1372.74 E:0.027764 |  And Joerke and Klopp is now predicting that
[3602.56 - 3604.16] P:1181.49 E:0.033533 |  Jordan Henderson won't be available
[3604.16 - 3605.92] P:1207.15 E:0.031676 |  until after the international break.
[3606.40 - 3608.16] P:1531.09 E:0.033510 |  So there's mixed news.
[3608.16 - 3611.12] P:1275.47 E:0.031713 |  But Thiago being back and also Cortarta
[3611.12 - 3613.52] P:1437.81 E:0.027089 |  who they signed last week on loan from Juventus,
[3613.52 - 3614.96] P:1503.84 E:0.036271 |  he is ready to play.
[3614.96 - 3616.32] P:1134.34 E:0.014269 |  He needs minutes.
[3616.32 - 3617.36] P:1433.43 E:0.036979 |  So he's ready to play.
[3617.36 - 3619.36] P:1334.28 E:0.032224 |  But Joerke and Klopp have said he's not ready to
[3620.16 - 3622.16] P:1337.84 E:0.029838 |  to fulfill a whole 90 minutes.
[3622.16 - 3624.16] P:1428.94 E:0.028361 |  So I'm expecting him to feature at some stage.
[3624.72 - 3626.72] P:1397.12 E:0.043939 |  For the players in the Premier League
[3626.72 - 3628.16] P:1468.69 E:0.042054 |  who are in European competition,
[3628.16 - 3629.60] P:1712.60 E:0.047064 |  they're going to be playing every midweek
[3629.60 - 3631.28] P:1428.91 E:0.039869 |  from now until the World Cup.
[3631.28 - 3634.08] P:1547.55 E:0.041141 |  So how does that impact on Joerke and Klopp's ability
[3634.16 - 3637.12] P:1649.79 E:0.040203 |  with the injuries to keep his players rotated and fresh?
[3637.68 - 3640.16] P:1386.78 E:0.034679 |  Well, it was one question I wanted to ask him.
[3640.16 - 3641.44] P:1456.79 E:0.037224 |  Because as you're right,
[3641.44 - 3645.04] P:1621.76 E:0.031772 |  it's the condensed nature of this group stage schedule now
[3645.04 - 3646.72] P:1359.07 E:0.031482 |  because of the World Cup.
[3646.72 - 3648.72] P:1417.61 E:0.027047 |  So they're going to have the six games being played
[3648.72 - 3650.24] P:1171.55 E:0.034450 |  in an eight week period.
[3650.24 - 3652.40] P:1238.72 E:0.033668 |  However, I was unable to ask the question
[3652.40 - 3654.08] P:1588.81 E:0.036375 |  because an Italian journalist,
[3654.08 - 3654.96] P:1538.26 E:0.027493 |  he was in great mood.
[3654.96 - 3655.76] P:1198.19 E:0.049174 |  He was very relaxed.
[3655.76 - 3657.20] P:1548.11 E:0.020587 |  He was smiling throughout.
[3657.20 - 3659.52] P:1305.55 E:0.026442 |  But one Italian journalist asked the question
[3659.52 - 3662.00] P:1422.09 E:0.028878 |  about his naples of safe city.
[3662.00 - 3663.68] P:1322.79 E:0.044974 |  And he really did bristle at that.
[3663.68 - 3665.68] P:1362.54 E:0.027463 |  And he responded by saying,
[3665.68 - 3667.52] P:1331.39 E:0.024196 |  that's an embarrassing question.
[3667.52 - 3668.64] P:1215.45 E:0.040669 |  I don't live in Naples.
[3668.64 - 3669.92] P:1128.99 E:0.037373 |  I don't live in Naples.
[3671.04 - 3672.00] P:1382.81 E:0.032946 |  You told me, you know,
[3672.00 - 3673.84] P:1238.69 E:0.031155 |  I'm not going to make your headlines for you.
[3673.84 - 3676.64] P:1576.98 E:0.031736 |  The reason that the Italian journalist asked the question
[3676.64 - 3678.24] P:1239.21 E:0.037783 |  is that Liverpool as a football club
[3678.24 - 3680.40] P:1333.43 E:0.031321 |  have today put out some safety advice
[3680.40 - 3682.56] P:1438.69 E:0.027417 |  for their supporters traveling to the game,
[3682.56 - 3683.44] P:1108.91 E:0.038335 |  not to wear colours,
[3684.40 - 3686.40] P:1596.32 E:0.028813 |  to stay close to the hotel,
[3686.40 - 3688.72] P:1210.87 E:0.025290 |  and not to make their own way to the stadium.
[3688.72 - 3690.56] P:1339.62 E:0.034574 |  There have been issues in the past
[3690.56 - 3692.32] P:1277.45 E:0.030932 |  with not just Liverpool fans
[3692.32 - 3693.44] P:1397.18 E:0.030736 |  when they've come here to Naples.
[3693.68 - 3695.12] P:1270.61 E:0.038715 |  So that was why the question was asked.
[3695.12 - 3696.88] P:1659.38 E:0.029023 |  But Jürgen Klopp at that point
[3696.88 - 3698.24] P:1710.08 E:0.019163 |  then ended his press conference.
[3698.88 - 3701.04] P:1698.31 E:0.045637 |  And we will end our conversation here as well.
[3701.04 - 3702.32] P:1759.94 E:0.052032 |  Then, good to hear from you.
[3702.32 - 3705.68] P:1916.41 E:0.042765 |  I like that kind of slightly old fashioned,
[3705.68 - 3708.80] P:1762.84 E:0.040852 |  old school retro way of speaking to us from Europe.
[3708.80 - 3709.84] P:1735.14 E:0.041059 |  Down a crackly line.
[3709.84 - 3712.88] P:1586.04 E:0.042016 |  It takes me back to the early stages of the European Cup.
[3712.88 - 3715.12] P:1763.71 E:0.039491 |  Now, last time Rangers reached the group stage
[3715.12 - 3716.72] P:1598.54 E:0.039544 |  of the Champions League was in 2010.
[3716.72 - 3718.32] P:1465.75 E:0.050294 |  They take on Ajax tomorrow.
[3718.32 - 3720.24] P:1491.90 E:0.039462 |  Vicki Sparks and Pat Neven will bring you commentary
[3720.24 - 3722.00] P:1675.33 E:0.039806 |  of that from 5.45.
[3722.00 - 3724.40] P:1587.20 E:0.042874 |  And there's lots more from our teams in Naples and Amsterdam
[3724.40 - 3727.12] P:1783.09 E:0.042892 |  on a special Football Daily Away Days podcast.
[3727.12 - 3728.48] P:1376.85 E:0.043221 |  That's available later tonight.
[3728.48 - 3730.72] P:1719.49 E:0.040265 |  And then when you check BBC's sounds in the morning,
[3730.72 - 3732.40] P:1887.32 E:0.046358 |  you'll be able to do that.
[3732.40 - 3734.32] P:1827.27 E:0.048769 |  We'll give you up to date with all things Champions League
[3734.32 - 3736.80] P:1650.71 E:0.049022 |  this evening, our commentary matches at Selhurst Park,
[3736.80 - 3737.84] P:1833.26 E:0.040907 |  with you for the second half.
[3737.84 - 3739.60] P:1612.69 E:0.045085 |  James McFadden and Alistair Bruce Ball.
[3740.16 - 3742.80] P:2024.17 E:0.039432 |  Kelly Cates, you could not have timed that any better.
[3742.80 - 3743.76] P:1698.44 E:0.051983 |  The whistle blows.
[3743.76 - 3746.08] P:1986.51 E:0.044901 |  The second half is underway.
[3746.08 - 3749.84] P:1871.79 E:0.039447 |  Change made by each manager at halftime.
[3749.92 - 3753.20] P:1834.61 E:0.043845 |  We hope this game continues in the vein.
[3753.20 - 3754.80] P:1846.05 E:0.044863 |  It was running in the first half.
[3754.80 - 3757.60] P:1910.53 E:0.046114 |  Hugely entertaining goalless draw so far.
[3758.24 - 3761.68] P:1885.31 E:0.045354 |  One of the Japanese, one of Celtics Japanese contingent,
[3761.68 - 3765.12] P:1777.20 E:0.045745 |  Dyson Maida has come on wide on the right-hand side
[3765.12 - 3768.00] P:1838.60 E:0.042943 |  in place of the young Israeli Lille Abarda.
[3768.00 - 3769.68] P:1927.51 E:0.032211 |  That is the change for Celtic.
[3769.68 - 3772.64] P:1726.55 E:0.041345 |  And change at centre back for Real Madrid.
[3772.64 - 3774.16] P:1820.17 E:0.036579 |  Someone you might recognise, actually,
[3774.16 - 3776.72] P:1830.58 E:0.045651 |  we're in the number 22 first season at the club,
[3776.72 - 3778.72] P:1810.19 E:0.039732 |  having joined on a free from Chelsea.
[3778.72 - 3782.72] P:1708.59 E:0.041075 |  Antonio Rudiger plays alongside David Alaba.
[3782.72 - 3785.84] P:1699.27 E:0.041775 |  Edair Militão has gone off.
[3785.84 - 3788.40] P:1789.51 E:0.043202 |  England's women up against Luxembourg in the World Cup.
[3788.40 - 3790.40] P:1774.37 E:0.043744 |  Qualifying, another goal, Gary Flintoff.
[3790.40 - 3792.80] P:1721.65 E:0.049658 |  Yeah, 8-0, Elatun from the spot.
[3792.80 - 3794.40] P:1646.13 E:0.050325 |  England's second penalty of the night.
[3794.40 - 3796.80] P:1865.21 E:0.047266 |  A cheeky finish, sending the keeper the wrong way.
[3796.80 - 3798.80] P:1724.15 E:0.041652 |  England 8, Luxembourg 0.
[3798.80 - 3799.44] P:2009.19 E:0.040129 |  Thank you, Gary.
[3799.44 - 3801.44] P:1847.97 E:0.049183 |  Tua Mayny on the ball for Real Madrid.
[3801.44 - 3803.44] P:1940.67 E:0.045834 |  Here's Rudiger getting some early touches.
[3803.44 - 3806.72] P:1946.44 E:0.041829 |  He's going to have to battle against Georgios Jakoumakis.
[3806.72 - 3808.72] P:1824.43 E:0.043910 |  Celtic's Greek centre forward, Kiyogo,
[3808.72 - 3812.48] P:1783.04 E:0.044303 |  having picked up the early shoulder injury in the derby on Saturday.
[3812.48 - 3813.84] P:1571.35 E:0.045160 |  He's waiting there on the bench.
[3813.84 - 3818.00] P:1619.39 E:0.041937 |  We'll have to wait and see whether he gets any game time tonight.
[3818.00 - 3821.44] P:1760.38 E:0.045170 |  So great to have the Champions League back on five live in BBC Sounds.
[3821.44 - 3825.84] P:1752.09 E:0.042528 |  And this, as a first commentary, has been a real treat so far.
[3825.84 - 3829.76] P:1824.59 E:0.045313 |  The atmosphere just sort of steadily building early in the second half
[3829.76 - 3832.40] P:1778.55 E:0.043631 |  as the two teams just try and get back into those rhythms
[3832.40 - 3833.60] P:1821.07 E:0.045560 |  they had in the first half.
[3833.60 - 3835.60] P:1723.43 E:0.044785 |  James or McFadden, bring you in in a second,
[3835.68 - 3838.16] P:1681.80 E:0.044243 |  because Val Verde is on the turn here.
[3838.16 - 3840.32] P:1799.58 E:0.046603 |  He has been dangerous for Real on the right-hand side.
[3840.32 - 3842.80] P:1805.70 E:0.044137 |  McGregor's done some brilliant ball winning for Celtic.
[3842.80 - 3844.24] P:1751.72 E:0.041576 |  He's done it again there.
[3844.24 - 3847.04] P:1856.34 E:0.048734 |  Plays it up to Jakoumakis, holds off Tua Mayny brilliantly.
[3847.04 - 3850.16] P:1956.51 E:0.045608 |  Jota sliding the pass through to the substitute Mayida,
[3850.16 - 3851.36] P:1922.29 E:0.048223 |  lays it back to Jota.
[3851.36 - 3854.64] P:1913.99 E:0.049209 |  He's 30 yards out in the inside left channel, wide to O'Reilly.
[3854.64 - 3858.32] P:1944.56 E:0.048267 |  Early ball, chested it down by Yuranovic, drives it across goal.
[3858.32 - 3859.92] P:1956.91 E:0.054230 |  Oh, Mayida's misquoted.
[3859.92 - 3861.60] P:1974.85 E:0.050883 |  Easy save for Kortor.
[3861.60 - 3863.12] P:2007.61 E:0.046032 |  Proper contact on that.
[3863.12 - 3864.40] P:2083.38 E:0.048011 |  Celtic would have had the lead.
[3864.40 - 3865.52] P:1739.12 E:0.055952 |  What a chance it is.
[3866.16 - 3868.48] P:1929.19 E:0.052997 |  What a chance that is for Celtic.
[3868.48 - 3871.04] P:1863.03 E:0.053829 |  Jakoumakis is brilliant to hold the ball up.
[3871.04 - 3873.20] P:1880.28 E:0.045470 |  Then the break, Jota plays it to Mayida,
[3873.20 - 3874.64] P:1735.88 E:0.045894 |  who plays it back to him.
[3874.64 - 3876.64] P:1888.93 E:0.043552 |  It comes down the left-hand side.
[3876.64 - 3878.96] P:1840.43 E:0.049488 |  And when it's crossed back across to the right,
[3879.52 - 3880.80] P:1950.46 E:0.045155 |  it's fired across.
[3880.80 - 3883.04] P:1691.35 E:0.048412 |  Mayida just needs to get a good contact on it.
[3883.04 - 3884.72] P:1803.01 E:0.045798 |  It looked like he was going to score.
[3884.72 - 3886.48] P:1810.05 E:0.040512 |  It just gets stuck under his feet
[3886.48 - 3889.52] P:1713.59 E:0.052133 |  and rolls to the relieve table, Kortor and goal.
[3889.52 - 3891.76] P:1798.94 E:0.051310 |  That really should have been a goal for Celtic.
[3891.76 - 3893.36] P:1916.38 E:0.035481 |  It shows you that not quite everything
[3893.36 - 3895.20] P:1860.38 E:0.037575 |  and post-acoglued touch turns to goal,
[3895.20 - 3898.88] P:1720.98 E:0.044358 |  because that would have been an absolutely inspired substitution
[3898.88 - 3901.04] P:1685.72 E:0.041991 |  had Mayida been able to stick it away.
[3901.04 - 3902.80] P:1778.45 E:0.043738 |  The better chances in this game,
[3902.80 - 3905.60] P:1786.17 E:0.043780 |  as they were in the first half going to Celtic,
[3905.60 - 3909.44] P:1700.13 E:0.045468 |  Real Madrid lost Kari Mbensimartu, injury in that first half.
[3909.44 - 3910.32] P:1487.31 E:0.044019 |  He hobbled off.
[3910.32 - 3913.20] P:1610.96 E:0.039580 |  Aidan Hazard is playing as their centre forward,
[3913.20 - 3914.24] P:1728.06 E:0.045457 |  sort of false nine.
[3914.24 - 3916.56] P:1712.10 E:0.046475 |  Next break in play, we'll take you back to Seville.
[3916.56 - 3918.32] P:1820.57 E:0.050461 |  Conor McNamara bringing us the updates
[3918.32 - 3920.32] P:1810.20 E:0.044547 |  on Sevilla against Manchester City.
[3920.40 - 3924.00] P:1665.66 E:0.047829 |  They're leading 1-0 at halftime through an early Harlan goal.
[3924.00 - 3926.08] P:1605.72 E:0.045915 |  Yet another one of those.
[3926.08 - 3928.32] P:1779.74 E:0.049943 |  5.30 commentary on Saturday, by the way,
[3928.32 - 3932.72] P:1687.51 E:0.045688 |  on BBC Radio 5 Live Manchester City against Tottenham.
[3932.72 - 3933.52] P:1832.26 E:0.047880 |  Should be some game.
[3933.52 - 3936.08] P:1854.33 E:0.048978 |  Valverde finds space down the right.
[3936.08 - 3938.96] P:1943.91 E:0.047185 |  Hazard onto the ball, little cutback, not enough on it.
[3938.96 - 3942.24] P:1900.23 E:0.047499 |  Carvajal in and Jens knocks it out for a throw-in.
[3942.24 - 3944.40] P:1807.73 E:0.040599 |  And then Celtic's defenders complain
[3944.40 - 3946.00] P:1776.43 E:0.048212 |  that there should have been an offside flag up,
[3946.00 - 3948.64] P:1802.25 E:0.042134 |  because Hazard was in eight as a space on that ride.
[3948.64 - 3949.76] P:1875.25 E:0.040973 |  But the flag stayed down.
[3949.76 - 3951.60] P:1764.85 E:0.049718 |  Obviously, it would have been checked by BAR
[3951.60 - 3952.56] P:1744.77 E:0.045861 |  had it led to a goal.
[3952.56 - 3954.40] P:1783.73 E:0.049580 |  Valverde away from Hattate.
[3954.40 - 3955.60] P:1975.61 E:0.051621 |  Tua-Maini with the shot.
[3955.60 - 3957.76] P:1867.23 E:0.044432 |  Maide is in there to make the block for Celtic.
[3957.76 - 3959.52] P:1753.86 E:0.038923 |  Comes back out to Carvajal.
[3959.52 - 3960.32] P:1573.08 E:0.047553 |  Here's Modric.
[3960.32 - 3962.64] P:1913.30 E:0.044566 |  Modric to Tua-Maini, short ball forward.
[3962.64 - 3963.68] P:1907.88 E:0.041882 |  Can't find Hazard.
[3963.68 - 3966.40] P:1771.05 E:0.043653 |  Hattate trying to dribble out of a tight spot.
[3966.40 - 3970.00] P:1819.47 E:0.046217 |  Tua-Maini is leaning over in much the taller man.
[3970.00 - 3972.88] P:1807.65 E:0.049271 |  Hattate drags him out to the left, gives them all away.
[3972.88 - 3977.12] P:1707.67 E:0.044421 |  Carvajal's pass infield, headed away by McGregor out to the left.
[3977.20 - 3979.44] P:1849.17 E:0.046394 |  Tarté tries to keep it in, does so,
[3979.44 - 3982.32] P:1818.39 E:0.047084 |  somehow gets it to Taylor with a little hook pass.
[3982.32 - 3984.08] P:1803.75 E:0.047949 |  Yens clears with his right foot.
[3984.08 - 3986.40] P:1896.83 E:0.047394 |  Modric works it back to the halfway line,
[3986.40 - 3989.36] P:1900.08 E:0.046475 |  and Rudiger comes back to David Alaba.
[3989.36 - 3992.56] P:1839.97 E:0.048720 |  Jacomacus chases him into the Real Madrid half.
[3992.56 - 3995.44] P:1873.04 E:0.048473 |  Now you can hear that atmosphere building just a little bit more,
[3995.44 - 3999.68] P:1911.21 E:0.044019 |  and Real Madrid come back to goalkeeper Tebow Courtois.
[3999.68 - 4003.52] P:1866.64 E:0.044584 |  Courtois with his left foot drills it out to the right wing.
[4003.52 - 4004.88] P:1847.88 E:0.038815 |  Carvajal chests it down.
[4004.96 - 4007.28] P:1738.93 E:0.041080 |  Carvajal back to Rudiger.
[4007.28 - 4009.12] P:1758.09 E:0.047597 |  Ancelotti shakes his head below us,
[4009.12 - 4010.96] P:1773.00 E:0.047740 |  still not happy with what he's seeing
[4010.96 - 4013.52] P:1767.54 E:0.042256 |  from the European champions so far tonight.
[4013.52 - 4016.16] P:1780.40 E:0.046096 |  Modric sees a lot of space for Fael on Mendi,
[4016.16 - 4018.72] P:1651.44 E:0.041814 |  the left back, bringing it forward for Real Madrid
[4018.72 - 4019.84] P:1867.97 E:0.047956 |  in his bright orange boots.
[4019.84 - 4022.00] P:1985.87 E:0.042336 |  Deflection on the cross, back to Joe Hart.
[4022.00 - 4024.08] P:1861.74 E:0.042382 |  And let's get to Seville. Conor McNamara.
[4024.08 - 4026.40] P:1661.11 E:0.051533 |  Yes, a still severe nil match as to City 1,
[4026.40 - 4029.12] P:1598.35 E:0.052603 |  but City have had two big chances in quick succession.
[4029.12 - 4032.08] P:1407.80 E:0.055455 |  Debrunno played through 1-1, denied by the goalkeeper Pony,
[4032.08 - 4033.44] P:1803.06 E:0.043415 |  and then Harnett stretching,
[4033.44 - 4035.68] P:1621.51 E:0.053786 |  but couldn't get a touch with the goal in his mercy.
[4035.68 - 4037.20] P:1612.35 E:0.049379 |  Sevignal City won.
[4037.20 - 4039.52] P:1898.49 E:0.044019 |  Real Madrid win the ball off Celtic inside the Celtic.
[4039.52 - 4041.60] P:1819.27 E:0.048253 |  Hart, Modric gets his head down, runs forward,
[4041.60 - 4044.56] P:1952.46 E:0.047708 |  little step over edge of the box, plays it to Venicius Jr.
[4044.56 - 4046.40] P:1910.53 E:0.051110 |  Great tackle on him by Moritz Jens,
[4046.40 - 4049.28] P:1946.89 E:0.052817 |  and suddenly opens up for Celtic, four on four.
[4049.28 - 4051.76] P:2021.19 E:0.047829 |  Options for Matto Reilly left and right.
[4051.76 - 4055.12] P:1944.67 E:0.046673 |  Decides not to release the ball, Valverde chases him back.
[4055.12 - 4057.12] P:1874.23 E:0.047171 |  Now you run of it quickly up in support,
[4057.12 - 4059.68] P:1845.03 E:0.043627 |  speeding away down the right-hand side for Celtic
[4059.68 - 4062.72] P:1925.09 E:0.044386 |  in the green and white hoops, attacking the goal to air.
[4062.80 - 4065.28] P:1939.15 E:0.048638 |  Left-hand side as we look at it in this second half.
[4065.28 - 4067.68] P:1968.94 E:0.047572 |  Ptate looks for the run of Maeda.
[4067.68 - 4069.92] P:1889.77 E:0.048603 |  Maeda is so busy at both ends of the pitch,
[4069.92 - 4071.36] P:1922.62 E:0.040423 |  and the ball is with Tebo Cordoire.
[4071.36 - 4072.88] P:1664.08 E:0.048425 |  His work rate's incredible.
[4072.88 - 4075.04] P:1476.10 E:0.056220 |  I think it was the right decision by Matto Reilly
[4075.04 - 4076.24] P:1907.92 E:0.038811 |  not to play the pass.
[4076.24 - 4079.60] P:1837.74 E:0.040455 |  It did look like it would have been a good race
[4079.60 - 4082.96] P:1723.22 E:0.042547 |  between Maeda and Mende,
[4082.96 - 4084.72] P:1770.94 E:0.053538 |  but I don't think it was the right option.
[4084.72 - 4086.32] P:1702.08 E:0.045456 |  I think he'd done the right thing,
[4086.32 - 4089.00] P:1719.70 E:0.051895 |  but then a tactic goes and tries to thread that through.
[4089.00 - 4093.40] P:1850.70 E:0.045279 |  But Maeda will bring endless amounts of energy.
[4093.40 - 4094.76] P:1805.08 E:0.044252 |  He's got one speed.
[4094.76 - 4096.68] P:1812.86 E:0.051672 |  It is very, very fast.
[4096.68 - 4100.24] P:1824.63 E:0.048109 |  He just goes non-stop, and he will be a nuisance.
[4100.24 - 4101.72] P:1712.48 E:0.045676 |  Great threat going forward.
[4101.72 - 4104.08] P:1657.71 E:0.047848 |  Unbelievable work rate going back the way as well.
[4104.08 - 4106.56] P:1896.25 E:0.039463 |  Played over five minutes in the second half at Celtic Park.
[4106.56 - 4109.16] P:1929.95 E:0.048435 |  You're listening to it live on BBC Radio 5 Live,
[4109.16 - 4110.88] P:1944.54 E:0.041871 |  also available on the BBC Sounds app.
[4110.88 - 4113.24] P:1771.89 E:0.044288 |  You don't have to miss a thing if you're on the move.
[4113.24 - 4115.16] P:1838.98 E:0.044764 |  Two more Champions League commentaries tomorrow,
[4115.16 - 4117.16] P:1872.14 E:0.043239 |  as Kelly was telling you at halftime.
[4117.16 - 4119.60] P:1653.69 E:0.046592 |  He and Dennis sounded like he was bobbing up and down in the water,
[4119.60 - 4121.44] P:1635.31 E:0.043607 |  under water and above the water,
[4121.44 - 4123.28] P:1804.61 E:0.048588 |  as he was reporting from Naples.
[4123.28 - 4125.00] P:1781.41 E:0.041467 |  That's our eight o'clock tomorrow night.
[4125.00 - 4127.88] P:1604.56 E:0.042427 |  Liverpool away to Napoli, 545.
[4127.88 - 4130.80] P:1729.22 E:0.042270 |  Rangers back in the big time away to Ajax.
[4130.80 - 4132.92] P:1952.85 E:0.045866 |  Modric, pass forward, intercepted.
[4132.92 - 4135.88] P:1842.12 E:0.042214 |  McGregor on the ball for Celtic, having a great game tonight.
[4135.88 - 4137.28] P:2013.26 E:0.048406 |  Very nearly gave Celtic the lead.
[4137.28 - 4139.32] P:2017.86 E:0.041890 |  That pass forward, Jota can't catch it.
[4139.32 - 4140.96] P:1926.54 E:0.051180 |  Your Celtic line-up then, second half.
[4140.96 - 4142.20] P:2034.10 E:0.041478 |  Johart in goal.
[4142.20 - 4146.28] P:1867.03 E:0.041411 |  Yuranovic, Kartavikas, Jens and Greg Taylor back four.
[4146.32 - 4149.32] P:1968.73 E:0.046242 |  McGregor with O'Reilly and Hatate either side of him.
[4149.32 - 4152.04] P:1718.51 E:0.044809 |  Maidas come on for Abadah, wide on the right.
[4152.04 - 4155.52] P:1786.20 E:0.044325 |  Jota on the left and Georgios Jakomakis through the middle.
[4155.52 - 4160.08] P:1663.17 E:0.043359 |  Real Madrid have Tivo Kortuar in goal, dressed all in red
[4160.08 - 4163.04] P:1707.39 E:0.039593 |  with the giant black gloves away to our left.
[4163.04 - 4165.28] P:1810.44 E:0.041396 |  Carvajal on the right-hand side.
[4165.28 - 4167.92] P:1871.44 E:0.046161 |  Rudiger on to partner Alibar at centre-back.
[4167.92 - 4169.56] P:1859.07 E:0.047893 |  Mendiat left-back on the yellow card.
[4169.56 - 4171.16] P:1798.03 E:0.043802 |  Here is Carvajal, left-footed ball.
[4171.16 - 4173.08] P:1931.32 E:0.049646 |  Valverde's got to work to keep that in play.
[4173.08 - 4174.08] P:1981.95 E:0.048266 |  Can't do it.
[4174.08 - 4177.12] P:1933.94 E:0.044370 |  He falls skids off his right boot into the advertising hoardings.
[4177.12 - 4179.00] P:1878.97 E:0.035429 |  Celtic have a goal kick.
[4179.00 - 4182.80] P:1915.82 E:0.044651 |  Ben Zemar replaced by Hazard in the first half.
[4182.80 - 4186.40] P:1822.17 E:0.041312 |  Venetius Jr. and Valverde either side of him.
[4186.40 - 4190.24] P:1826.24 E:0.042465 |  And in midfield, Tua Mane, Modric and Kroos.
[4190.24 - 4193.24] P:1822.58 E:0.042479 |  Ben Fika, who would have started favourites for the game tonight,
[4193.24 - 4195.56] P:1860.36 E:0.040510 |  have a goal against Maccabee.
[4195.56 - 4197.68] P:1823.01 E:0.045591 |  Haifa, that's in Champions League Group H.
[4197.68 - 4199.80] P:1804.86 E:0.048413 |  And Baphe scored two in the other game in that group.
[4199.80 - 4203.32] P:1810.66 E:0.041518 |  PSG, Lidia Ventus by two goals to Nel.
[4203.36 - 4206.44] P:1838.82 E:0.040723 |  Atate, right in the middle of the Real Madrid half.
[4206.44 - 4210.36] P:1808.15 E:0.038586 |  They're in dark black change kit this evening,
[4210.36 - 4211.72] P:1696.83 E:0.053146 |  with luminous green trim.
[4211.72 - 4214.88] P:1792.08 E:0.044828 |  The last time they were here, back in 1980, 42 years ago,
[4214.88 - 4218.88] P:1834.07 E:0.044101 |  they played in all blue, rather unusually for Real Madrid.
[4218.88 - 4220.00] P:1854.47 E:0.047733 |  So not in the famous white,
[4220.00 - 4223.88] P:1890.79 E:0.041325 |  but you can obviously see the potential for the clash
[4223.88 - 4226.64] P:1816.67 E:0.046832 |  with lots of white in Celtic's kit as well.
[4226.64 - 4228.88] P:1814.35 E:0.044000 |  McGregor's pass across the Real Madrid half.
[4228.88 - 4233.00] P:1889.55 E:0.038154 |  Hazard, half-intercept, he comes back to Carter Vickers.
[4233.04 - 4236.68] P:1779.62 E:0.046174 |  McGregor to Greg Taylor in central midfield, the left back.
[4236.68 - 4239.52] P:1748.81 E:0.044444 |  Wide it goes to Yiranovich, quickly gets it out from under his feet.
[4239.52 - 4242.44] P:1794.26 E:0.041207 |  Kirling Cross looking for Jackamakis, cleared to Hazard.
[4242.44 - 4244.28] P:1645.18 E:0.037175 |  Hazard lays it back to Kroos.
[4244.28 - 4245.72] P:1641.19 E:0.038935 |  Kroos to Mendi.
[4245.72 - 4247.96] P:1538.09 E:0.041112 |  Mendi runs away from Maida.
[4247.96 - 4250.16] P:1756.87 E:0.045822 |  Strokes a lovely pass into the feet of Modric,
[4250.16 - 4252.12] P:1807.42 E:0.044755 |  quickly onto Valverde.
[4252.12 - 4255.48] P:1995.87 E:0.047182 |  Good challenge on him, tackled by Greg Taylor,
[4255.48 - 4257.08] P:1786.39 E:0.047281 |  and out it goes for a throw into Real Madrid.
[4257.08 - 4257.92] P:1916.83 E:0.034178 |  James McFadden.
[4257.92 - 4259.96] P:1603.99 E:0.046234 |  It just looks so good when Modric passes the ball,
[4259.96 - 4262.60] P:1682.96 E:0.046491 |  and it's so relaxed, outside of the birds.
[4262.68 - 4266.20] P:1736.66 E:0.040483 |  Casuals you like, inch perfect weight.
[4266.20 - 4268.04] P:1652.94 E:0.049680 |  He is a role-roist of a footballer.
[4268.04 - 4269.12] P:1821.56 E:0.036124 |  It's a joy to watch.
[4269.12 - 4270.32] P:1956.52 E:0.044796 |  It's another one, isn't it?
[4270.32 - 4272.08] P:1699.65 E:0.043184 |  They applauded Benzemaar up in the first half,
[4272.08 - 4275.28] P:1791.80 E:0.040530 |  but if you're a Celtic fan to watch Modric's live
[4275.28 - 4277.08] P:1731.30 E:0.039757 |  against your team...
[4277.08 - 4279.80] P:1591.04 E:0.052991 |  Yeah, as long as he doesn't do what he did against Scotland
[4279.80 - 4281.92] P:1722.01 E:0.046921 |  in the summer, because that was the same.
[4281.92 - 4283.88] P:1586.67 E:0.041998 |  He was absolutely outstanding in that game,
[4283.88 - 4285.72] P:1598.94 E:0.044645 |  and he'd come in for a lot of sticking the Euros.
[4285.72 - 4288.36] P:1806.56 E:0.048562 |  Said his legs had gone, and he responded well.
[4288.36 - 4291.32] P:1740.45 E:0.049374 |  Obviously goes on to win another Champions League as well.
[4291.32 - 4293.16] P:1776.96 E:0.034723 |  He's just such a terrific footballer.
[4293.16 - 4294.40] P:1815.05 E:0.041464 |  Yeah, as I said in the first half,
[4294.40 - 4298.16] P:1828.48 E:0.045152 |  37 years old on Friday, improving with age.
[4298.16 - 4301.00] P:1784.52 E:0.051425 |  Former Tottenham Hotspur, they're in Champions League action tomorrow.
[4301.00 - 4304.40] P:1906.18 E:0.044516 |  John Murray will be there for updates on Tottenham against Marseille.
[4304.40 - 4306.56] P:1945.75 E:0.051126 |  Joe Hart, that's a nice ball, floated to the right.
[4306.56 - 4309.80] P:1921.37 E:0.043480 |  Yuranovic, freedom of Celtic park, charges forward,
[4309.80 - 4311.16] P:1810.67 E:0.045245 |  crosses the halfway line.
[4311.16 - 4314.76] P:1813.99 E:0.043683 |  Maida stays wide for him in his yellow boots, in his bald head.
[4314.76 - 4317.32] P:1865.57 E:0.043790 |  O'Reilly with the first-time ball, looking for Yuranovic.
[4317.32 - 4320.76] P:1918.83 E:0.050332 |  Can't find him, and through it comes to Courtois.
[4320.80 - 4324.64] P:1972.23 E:0.046052 |  Now Celtic feel that Courtois shouldn't have been able to pick that ball up.
[4324.64 - 4329.48] P:1922.77 E:0.041150 |  The referee clearly feels that it was accidentally deflected back to him,
[4329.48 - 4330.44] P:1945.81 E:0.044330 |  so he's allowed to.
[4330.44 - 4332.84] P:1891.00 E:0.054527 |  Yeah, I agree. I don't think he was trying to pass it back.
[4332.84 - 4335.36] P:1965.66 E:0.049426 |  I think he was trying to cut the pass out.
[4335.36 - 4338.20] P:1860.43 E:0.048720 |  But it's still on risk from Courtois, he did it.
[4338.20 - 4340.16] P:1755.32 E:0.033993 |  He didn't have to pick it up.
[4340.16 - 4343.16] P:1709.34 E:0.038662 |  He's taking a rest there, but I think it's the right decision.
[4343.16 - 4345.44] P:1574.51 E:0.043951 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid nil,
[4345.44 - 4348.20] P:1675.26 E:0.046136 |  talking about that European Cup quarterfinal in 1980.
[4348.20 - 4351.08] P:1787.84 E:0.049305 |  One of the BBC Scotland team was digging through the loft the other day,
[4351.08 - 4353.12] P:1714.22 E:0.044338 |  found a programme from the game.
[4353.12 - 4355.60] P:1664.15 E:0.042770 |  So I managed to take a photo of that programme,
[4355.60 - 4359.00] P:1657.72 E:0.045672 |  at Laurie Cunningham of Real Madrid on the front cover,
[4359.00 - 4362.16] P:1607.45 E:0.041925 |  alongside tonight's programme as well.
[4362.16 - 4363.84] P:1850.55 E:0.049004 |  42 years between the games,
[4363.84 - 4366.56] P:1744.80 E:0.040676 |  only the second time these two famous clubs
[4366.56 - 4369.76] P:1632.70 E:0.042244 |  have met in competitive European competition tonight.
[4369.76 - 4371.36] P:1757.44 E:0.049883 |  It's nil nil, and Celtic are pressing,
[4371.36 - 4374.60] P:1942.78 E:0.045767 |  and Maida is trying to hassle Alaba out of possession.
[4374.60 - 4377.00] P:1954.22 E:0.048527 |  England's women leading Luxembourg by eight goals to nil.
[4377.00 - 4379.40] P:1964.06 E:0.044763 |  commentary continues on five sports extra.
[4379.40 - 4381.04] P:1979.02 E:0.049653 |  Carvajal on the ball for Real Madrid.
[4381.04 - 4383.32] P:1990.90 E:0.042021 |  Celtic again chasing them down.
[4383.32 - 4386.24] P:1945.43 E:0.045753 |  Valverde flicks it round the corner, has our chest sit down.
[4386.24 - 4388.84] P:1918.74 E:0.047239 |  Valverde with his pace away down the right-hand side.
[4388.84 - 4390.36] P:1919.79 E:0.044864 |  No options really in the middle.
[4390.36 - 4391.64] P:1919.47 E:0.051931 |  Joranovic got to get across the cover.
[4391.64 - 4393.16] P:1943.57 E:0.041589 |  It's one nil!
[4393.16 - 4395.96] P:2021.40 E:0.048840 |  Venetius Jr. pops up at the far post.
[4395.96 - 4399.16] P:1934.08 E:0.052109 |  The man who scored the winner in the final in Paris in May
[4399.16 - 4401.16] P:1873.61 E:0.047975 |  runs off to the corner flag,
[4401.16 - 4404.88] P:1871.85 E:0.047012 |  does a little jig in front of the Celtic fans to taunt them.
[4404.92 - 4407.52] P:1940.98 E:0.048996 |  Deadly counter-attacking from Real Madrid,
[4407.52 - 4410.12] P:2036.66 E:0.052095 |  and Venetius Jr. gives them the lead.
[4410.12 - 4412.32] P:2037.59 E:0.050514 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid won.
[4412.32 - 4414.36] P:1966.85 E:0.046142 |  What a sensational goal it is.
[4414.36 - 4416.40] P:1949.71 E:0.050417 |  Real Madrid look like they're under pressure.
[4416.40 - 4418.24] P:1820.33 E:0.052649 |  They look like they're going to get forced into a mistake.
[4418.24 - 4419.64] P:1813.92 E:0.043417 |  They knock it round the back,
[4419.64 - 4422.60] P:1810.17 E:0.046938 |  and when it comes in, it has a deflux around the corner
[4422.60 - 4424.44] P:1773.90 E:0.047877 |  to Valverde with the back heel,
[4424.44 - 4425.84] P:1922.23 E:0.050310 |  and you know he's got the pace.
[4425.84 - 4429.64] P:1849.64 E:0.045820 |  It gets his head up, he just plays a perfectly weighted pass
[4429.64 - 4433.48] P:1801.84 E:0.052027 |  right across the box, about 14 yards out for Venetius to run on.
[4433.52 - 4436.36] P:1792.86 E:0.047217 |  It doesn't even check his run, opens up the right foot,
[4436.36 - 4439.20] P:1849.92 E:0.049677 |  passes it back across Johar, into the side net,
[4439.20 - 4442.48] P:1815.28 E:0.051585 |  and a sensational goal is a hammer blow for Celtic.
[4442.48 - 4444.96] P:1873.50 E:0.053536 |  But listen to the reaction of this crowd.
[4444.96 - 4447.48] P:1924.37 E:0.051776 |  They're trying to fire the players up to say
[4447.48 - 4450.20] P:1733.09 E:0.049296 |  they're still behind them, they can get back level.
[4450.20 - 4452.80] P:1828.93 E:0.043237 |  Yep, was always going to be the way.
[4452.80 - 4455.44] P:1707.59 E:0.046521 |  Real Madrid were always going to offer the threat.
[4455.44 - 4456.48] P:1912.35 E:0.043461 |  They have got the lead.
[4456.48 - 4458.32] P:1888.93 E:0.046303 |  We know how Celtic are going to react,
[4458.32 - 4460.28] P:1730.80 E:0.040626 |  and the fans are going to back them all the way.
[4460.28 - 4462.20] P:1922.68 E:0.044782 |  Another goal in Seville, Conor McNamara.
[4462.24 - 4463.92] P:1783.84 E:0.049493 |  And another goal for Manchester City,
[4463.92 - 4466.12] P:1599.74 E:0.050814 |  who leads Seville by two goals to Neal now.
[4466.12 - 4470.00] P:1611.94 E:0.050216 |  Phil Foden chopped, turned three times in the penalty area
[4470.00 - 4472.28] P:1533.89 E:0.046826 |  before rolling it into the bottom corner.
[4472.28 - 4474.36] P:1593.16 E:0.050543 |  Wonderful individual goal.
[4474.36 - 4475.76] P:1625.61 E:0.048326 |  Halland got the first one.
[4475.76 - 4478.16] P:1753.32 E:0.051212 |  Seville, Neal, Manchester City, two.
[4478.16 - 4481.80] P:1974.32 E:0.046446 |  Juventus have a goal back away to Paris-Sajamard.
[4481.80 - 4483.88] P:1890.90 E:0.042999 |  Paris-Sajamard, two Juventus, one.
[4483.88 - 4485.68] P:1959.12 E:0.044721 |  Manchester City, two goals to the good,
[4485.68 - 4487.24] P:1942.71 E:0.038734 |  good start to the Champions League.
[4487.24 - 4489.36] P:1787.14 E:0.036801 |  Campaign for them, Chelsea.
[4489.36 - 4490.96] P:1798.07 E:0.051493 |  Lost one Neal away to Deidre Mozar.
[4490.96 - 4492.88] P:1752.02 E:0.044484 |  Grappatate nearly gives the ball away.
[4492.88 - 4495.80] P:1887.97 E:0.041845 |  Hazard was very close to getting on to that
[4495.80 - 4497.84] P:1706.43 E:0.041029 |  with a clean run-through on goal.
[4497.84 - 4498.76] P:1764.56 E:0.040502 |  Couldn't quite get it.
[4498.76 - 4500.20] P:1864.63 E:0.046869 |  Carter-Vickers on to the ball.
[4500.20 - 4503.40] P:1806.66 E:0.039949 |  There was a slight delay in kick-off,
[4503.40 - 4505.08] P:1759.95 E:0.046110 |  where obviously the video assistant referee
[4505.08 - 4507.32] P:1896.18 E:0.045620 |  was just checking that the Real Madrid goal was OK,
[4507.32 - 4508.64] P:1743.77 E:0.042844 |  looking for a potential offside.
[4508.64 - 4511.08] P:1721.00 E:0.044910 |  Valverde is so dangerous down the right hand side.
[4511.08 - 4513.72] P:1753.72 E:0.047695 |  Didn't look like he had anyone to aim at in the middle,
[4513.72 - 4516.56] P:1858.45 E:0.044335 |  but Venetius was bombing on down that left hand side.
[4516.56 - 4518.52] P:1886.05 E:0.042979 |  He just put it into the space, didn't he, James?
[4518.52 - 4520.68] P:1451.87 E:0.055311 |  Yeah, I thought he was actually going to run
[4520.68 - 4523.20] P:1758.70 E:0.045090 |  towards goal, but it's great play against his head up.
[4523.20 - 4525.28] P:1823.09 E:0.048177 |  He sees Venetius in the far side,
[4525.28 - 4528.96] P:1781.63 E:0.041452 |  and it's just a perfectly weighted pass in his path,
[4528.96 - 4531.48] P:1796.31 E:0.039477 |  taking out the full defence, and what a finish.
[4531.48 - 4534.64] P:1920.48 E:0.039416 |  Such a composed finish from Venetius Jr.
[4534.64 - 4538.08] P:1780.12 E:0.046432 |  Leipzig won, Schachtar-Denietzk two,
[4538.08 - 4540.28] P:1686.93 E:0.038807 |  I think if I heard that correctly,
[4540.28 - 4545.40] P:1617.70 E:0.040751 |  and Ben Fika now leading Maccabi-Hyper, no, two-two, is it?
[4545.40 - 4548.72] P:1830.60 E:0.043421 |  Two-nil, sorry, Ben Fika leading Maccabi-Hyper, two-nil.
[4548.72 - 4550.32] P:1723.31 E:0.048075 |  He went one-nil early in the second half.
[4550.32 - 4551.84] P:1943.35 E:0.048532 |  So Ben Fika had two goals to the good.
[4551.84 - 4554.36] P:1804.51 E:0.039322 |  You may have a goal back against Paris Saint-Germain,
[4554.36 - 4559.04] P:1799.76 E:0.048328 |  and Leipzig won, Schachtar-Denietzk two, a late.
[4559.04 - 4561.48] P:1664.25 E:0.044740 |  Salzburg won AC Milan, won,
[4561.48 - 4566.32] P:1720.00 E:0.043881 |  and Borussia Dortmund three-nil winners against Copenhagen earlier on.
[4566.32 - 4570.44] P:1868.83 E:0.036063 |  That, again, in group G,
[4570.44 - 4571.72] P:1839.45 E:0.031113 |  which is Manchester City's group,
[4571.72 - 4573.44] P:1757.87 E:0.039580 |  because of course commentary next week,
[4573.44 - 4575.12] P:1747.50 E:0.041510 |  Manchester City against Dortmund,
[4575.12 - 4577.48] P:1867.59 E:0.042040 |  Erling Haaland against his former club.
[4577.48 - 4580.20] P:1800.89 E:0.039074 |  So let's see if Celtic can get back into this one.
[4580.24 - 4582.76] P:1714.13 E:0.037830 |  Coming up to the hour mark in the game,
[4582.76 - 4585.00] P:1842.74 E:0.042343 |  Celtic-nil, Real Madrid won.
[4585.00 - 4588.48] P:1898.90 E:0.044011 |  There was that sort of roar of noise to encourage Celtic to get back into it.
[4588.48 - 4590.84] P:1801.17 E:0.043396 |  Real Madrid are trying to sort of kill that and stem it
[4590.84 - 4594.16] P:1818.16 E:0.037046 |  by keeping the ball and quiet in the crowd.
[4594.16 - 4597.64] P:1730.26 E:0.040636 |  But you know, Celtic will keep going and will.
[4597.64 - 4600.32] P:1754.31 E:0.043701 |  They've had their chances, and you feel they can create more.
[4600.32 - 4602.36] P:1704.48 E:0.049669 |  Yeah, they can, but I'm just looking at Real Madrid.
[4602.36 - 4603.84] P:1751.03 E:0.041019 |  They've obviously got the lead now,
[4603.84 - 4605.36] P:1456.67 E:0.054280 |  and they have knocked the ball about well.
[4605.36 - 4608.44] P:1780.44 E:0.040157 |  They've been really patient in their build-up play.
[4608.44 - 4610.08] P:1792.56 E:0.043266 |  They've hit in the break at pace.
[4610.08 - 4613.20] P:1685.90 E:0.050832 |  But they won't get frustrated by having to keep the ball.
[4614.20 - 4615.64] P:1873.32 E:0.048137 |  Trouble again for Celtic here.
[4615.64 - 4618.08] P:1921.53 E:0.046358 |  Hazard speeding forward on the dribble up to the edge of the box.
[4618.08 - 4620.08] P:1916.27 E:0.051662 |  Slides it into Modric. Modric onto his left foot,
[4620.08 - 4621.24] P:1991.27 E:0.039247 |  looking to make space for the shot.
[4621.24 - 4622.68] P:2022.05 E:0.049217 |  Outside the right foot, it's in.
[4623.88 - 4625.76] P:2000.50 E:0.056002 |  Goalkeeper, Johar got a hand to it.
[4625.76 - 4626.88] P:1905.42 E:0.051958 |  He couldn't keep it out.
[4626.88 - 4629.80] P:1974.61 E:0.049003 |  The European champions showing their class.
[4629.80 - 4632.00] P:1755.04 E:0.044611 |  Bang, bang! In the second half.
[4632.00 - 4634.40] P:1863.34 E:0.046260 |  Celtic-nil, Real Madrid 2.
[4634.40 - 4637.12] P:1762.76 E:0.046943 |  Again, it's a devastating attack from Real Madrid.
[4637.12 - 4639.20] P:1940.24 E:0.053163 |  Knocked the ball about, nice and patient.
[4639.32 - 4641.40] P:1854.16 E:0.048238 |  It comes into Hazard. They get it on the turn,
[4641.40 - 4642.48] P:1879.08 E:0.053066 |  takes a couple of players out.
[4642.48 - 4645.12] P:1919.81 E:0.045951 |  Modric's making that overlap down the right-hand side,
[4645.12 - 4647.36] P:1810.50 E:0.044101 |  and Hazard just waits to the perfect moment,
[4647.36 - 4648.52] P:1577.61 E:0.042776 |  plays it in front of him.
[4648.52 - 4650.24] P:1725.14 E:0.049721 |  It looked like Modric was going to hit it first time
[4650.24 - 4652.00] P:1835.07 E:0.045521 |  when he's right foot chops inside.
[4652.00 - 4655.32] P:1777.34 E:0.043560 |  I think Jens gets a totter, but he just can't quite clear it,
[4655.32 - 4657.32] P:1671.52 E:0.054317 |  and then he puts it on the outside of that right boot.
[4657.32 - 4660.24] P:1870.56 E:0.046157 |  And you know, in that position, it's hitting the back of the net.
[4660.24 - 4663.16] P:1855.27 E:0.050024 |  Johar did get a touch there, but it's an incredible finish.
[4663.16 - 4665.48] P:1809.27 E:0.049822 |  It's an incredible move again from Real Madrid.
[4665.48 - 4667.28] P:2008.36 E:0.045400 |  We were talking about it, the goal against Scotland,
[4667.28 - 4669.72] P:1913.79 E:0.047234 |  the outside of the right foot from closer range this time.
[4669.72 - 4671.32] P:1944.87 E:0.046948 |  Modric, he thought the chance had gone,
[4671.32 - 4673.28] P:1863.77 E:0.042568 |  just whipped that right foot at the ball.
[4673.28 - 4675.44] P:1948.11 E:0.048624 |  Lovely connection with the outside of the right boot.
[4675.44 - 4678.12] P:1808.49 E:0.047949 |  And Johar made a fabulous attempt to try and save it.
[4678.12 - 4680.96] P:1796.66 E:0.045542 |  Got a hand to it, but it's ended up in the back of the goal,
[4680.96 - 4683.64] P:1941.53 E:0.046460 |  and there you go. I think it's two goals in the space
[4683.64 - 4688.16] P:1813.82 E:0.046759 |  of three or four minutes there for the European champions.
[4688.16 - 4691.88] P:1810.30 E:0.040919 |  That is why they are the European champions.
[4691.88 - 4692.68] P:1596.31 E:0.048587 |  Yeah, four minutes.
[4692.68 - 4694.80] P:1799.27 E:0.042842 |  Finishers Junior in the 56th minute.
[4694.84 - 4697.72] P:1688.37 E:0.042371 |  Luca Modric in the 60th minute.
[4697.72 - 4703.04] P:1784.59 E:0.042902 |  Carlo Ancelotti might finally enjoy his glass of red wine post-match
[4703.04 - 4705.44] P:1720.08 E:0.038952 |  after a visit to Celtic Park.
[4705.44 - 4707.64] P:1966.37 E:0.048115 |  Jota plays the ball down the left-hand touchline,
[4707.64 - 4710.32] P:1800.56 E:0.034602 |  looking for Taylor, intercepted,
[4710.32 - 4712.52] P:1696.05 E:0.043805 |  and it'll be a throw-in to Celtic.
[4712.52 - 4714.96] P:1666.39 E:0.042768 |  It's just clinical class attacking from Real Madrid.
[4714.96 - 4718.40] P:1524.29 E:0.037995 |  Yeah, as I did say in the first half,
[4718.40 - 4721.16] P:1754.63 E:0.049145 |  you wonder if, you know, not taking those chances for Celtic
[4721.16 - 4723.84] P:1839.74 E:0.038418 |  would come back to haunt them.
[4724.04 - 4724.84] P:1833.37 E:0.045696 |  And it has.
[4724.84 - 4727.52] P:1610.29 E:0.042946 |  You know, they started the second half well again,
[4727.52 - 4729.88] P:1608.40 E:0.044271 |  but Real Madrid just showing their class and, you know,
[4729.88 - 4732.72] P:1718.83 E:0.038811 |  the quality and the attacking threat.
[4732.72 - 4734.56] P:1771.30 E:0.048425 |  It's just sensational football.
[4734.56 - 4737.20] P:1581.52 E:0.039848 |  And when it comes back, even the one with Modric's there,
[4737.20 - 4741.32] P:1699.70 E:0.047672 |  Johar probably is 90% sure he's going with the outside,
[4741.32 - 4743.36] P:1679.59 E:0.044933 |  he's right-butt, into that side.
[4743.36 - 4747.20] P:1690.63 E:0.045289 |  So he can have an educated guess at it, and he reads it well,
[4747.20 - 4750.80] P:1859.20 E:0.044146 |  but it just shows you how good he is that he's almost telling Johar,
[4750.80 - 4752.48] P:1501.45 E:0.047935 |  I'm going to hit this with the outside and the right-butt,
[4752.48 - 4755.60] P:1663.27 E:0.036633 |  I'm going to put it in the side net and try and save it if you like.
[4755.60 - 4758.04] P:1901.45 E:0.047481 |  He'd done that, got it touched it, but just not enough.
[4758.04 - 4760.64] P:1953.98 E:0.046979 |  Looking worrying for Celtic now, they're giving the ball away again,
[4760.64 - 4762.12] P:1810.90 E:0.047359 |  and Real Madrid really are in the mood.
[4762.12 - 4764.12] P:2035.47 E:0.042713 |  They're leading Celtic by two goals to nil.
[4764.12 - 4767.00] P:1894.00 E:0.041580 |  Hazard plays it to Kroos, back to Tua Mane.
[4767.00 - 4770.28] P:1919.49 E:0.046494 |  Jackamak is chasing back, got a little flick in the eye
[4770.28 - 4772.72] P:1917.22 E:0.048488 |  from Tua Mane, who was trying to sort of hold him off.
[4772.72 - 4774.96] P:1926.09 E:0.041429 |  Celtic have won the ball back.
[4774.96 - 4778.60] P:1668.58 E:0.040672 |  Home fans telling a Tarte to move it on,
[4778.60 - 4781.36] P:1819.23 E:0.048071 |  plays it wide to Yiranovic, and then another pass goes astray,
[4781.40 - 4783.08] P:1931.82 E:0.046209 |  and Celtic have just slightly lost their way,
[4783.08 - 4785.84] P:1918.35 E:0.044047 |  and here's Venetius Jr. dribbling at high speed
[4785.84 - 4788.24] P:1834.06 E:0.042070 |  towards the Celtic defenders, plays it to Valverde.
[4788.24 - 4790.96] P:1836.30 E:0.045079 |  He waves Modric towards him, wants the run on the obla,
[4790.96 - 4793.44] P:1795.24 E:0.046987 |  was going to use him as the decoy, then plays it to Modric,
[4793.44 - 4796.84] P:1893.20 E:0.043439 |  high-floated cross to the far post, headed behind by Yiranovic
[4796.84 - 4798.16] P:1845.13 E:0.051080 |  for a corner to Real Madrid.
[4798.16 - 4801.20] P:1927.81 E:0.043166 |  They're suddenly in cruise control of the European champions.
[4801.20 - 4803.20] P:1878.24 E:0.043001 |  Ladies from Seville, Conor McNamara.
[4803.20 - 4805.56] P:1709.01 E:0.059270 |  It's still Seville at nil, not just to City 2,
[4805.56 - 4808.48] P:1751.32 E:0.055168 |  City of Henrikó, disallowed after filling to two here.
[4808.48 - 4810.76] P:1663.62 E:0.053447 |  Dolberg is coming out attacking on the edge of the penalty area,
[4810.76 - 4813.64] P:1670.66 E:0.055561 |  but City defenders around him, and Phil Ford on the side,
[4813.64 - 4815.36] P:1817.18 E:0.056051 |  but he cushioned the cut to Guggenroth,
[4815.36 - 4817.08] P:1680.76 E:0.055852 |  falling the net on the fly.
[4817.08 - 4818.68] P:1689.50 E:0.051412 |  Savvianil City 2.
[4818.68 - 4822.84] P:1893.69 E:0.036554 |  17 minutes gone, second half at Celtic Park.
[4822.84 - 4824.52] P:1736.43 E:0.042169 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid 2.
[4824.52 - 4828.04] P:1867.85 E:0.043339 |  Real Madrid corner, in it comes, in swinger.
[4828.04 - 4830.16] P:1894.49 E:0.046627 |  Dangerously dropping inside the six-yard box,
[4830.16 - 4832.20] P:1983.72 E:0.046037 |  Rudiger looking for his first goal for Real Madrid,
[4832.20 - 4833.52] P:1909.55 E:0.041859 |  can't get on the end of the header.
[4833.52 - 4835.76] P:1845.27 E:0.041932 |  Johard immediately grabs the replacement ball,
[4835.76 - 4838.20] P:1833.88 E:0.045162 |  spins it out in front of him, clears it, long downfield,
[4838.20 - 4840.64] P:1910.54 E:0.042615 |  Maida jumps for it, Modric goes down,
[4840.68 - 4842.04] P:1862.03 E:0.039691 |  holding the side of his head.
[4842.04 - 4845.56] P:1927.57 E:0.039204 |  Maida might get booked for that, in fact, I think he does.
[4845.56 - 4847.76] P:1956.05 E:0.049994 |  And England's women have scored another goal tonight,
[4847.76 - 4848.72] P:1896.45 E:0.028520 |  Gary Flintoff.
[4848.72 - 4851.00] P:1526.83 E:0.054235 |  They have indeed, 9-0, Lauren Hemp,
[4851.00 - 4852.80] P:1750.82 E:0.053203 |  stabbing home from close range.
[4852.80 - 4854.96] P:2020.98 E:0.050381 |  How's they score at 10?
[4854.96 - 4857.40] P:1788.62 E:0.055257 |  Peppery England again, they scored 10.
[4857.40 - 4860.16] P:1852.10 E:0.051676 |  Last time they played Luxembourg, they've scored 10 again.
[4860.16 - 4862.28] P:1753.27 E:0.048996 |  England 10, Luxembourg nil.
[4862.28 - 4864.68] P:2056.51 E:0.045822 |  And at least we got one of the goals on live this evening.
[4864.68 - 4867.20] P:1911.22 E:0.046826 |  Thank you, Gary. Commentary continues on Radio 5,
[4867.24 - 4870.88] P:1886.15 E:0.040600 |  Sports Extra talking, Sports Extra, if the weather allows.
[4870.88 - 4872.72] P:1690.70 E:0.039717 |  Third test against South Africa,
[4872.72 - 4876.32] P:1837.71 E:0.042728 |  England against South Africa, series nicely poised at one all.
[4876.32 - 4879.80] P:1878.11 E:0.042557 |  Starts on Thursday, ball by ball, commentary on Sports Extra,
[4879.80 - 4882.32] P:1783.16 E:0.042086 |  on Test Match Special, the weather forecast for Thursday
[4882.32 - 4884.28] P:1649.52 E:0.044080 |  doesn't look great at the moment,
[4884.28 - 4886.72] P:1788.83 E:0.044423 |  which is a little bit of a concern.
[4886.72 - 4889.64] P:1819.92 E:0.044564 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid 2, Manchester City 2-0 up,
[4889.64 - 4893.52] P:1750.56 E:0.043689 |  a way to severe, England's women 10-0 up against Luxembourg,
[4893.52 - 4896.68] P:1795.46 E:0.038591 |  in the women's World Cup qualifier.
[4896.72 - 4898.80] P:1783.71 E:0.048260 |  And they've really, Real Madrid, James,
[4898.80 - 4901.84] P:1805.38 E:0.042517 |  about it just taken the sting out of it completely, haven't they?
[4901.84 - 4904.56] P:1757.10 E:0.052119 |  Yeah, they have. They've had a great lift from the goal.
[4904.56 - 4908.28] P:1872.15 E:0.040705 |  And just think what would have happened had Celtic
[4908.28 - 4909.48] P:1741.46 E:0.050378 |  got themselves in front.
[4909.48 - 4911.16] P:1740.10 E:0.053263 |  How much of a lift would they have got?
[4911.16 - 4914.40] P:1855.04 E:0.046916 |  Because it is kind of not the stuffing out of Celtic a little bit.
[4914.40 - 4917.00] P:1847.36 E:0.046299 |  They will continue to pro, but the last couple of times
[4917.00 - 4918.96] P:1774.23 E:0.041485 |  they've had a chance to counter.
[4918.96 - 4921.12] P:1772.11 E:0.054389 |  It's two bodies, two or three bodies.
[4921.12 - 4923.88] P:1688.38 E:0.045975 |  Usually it's four and five and they look at real threat.
[4923.88 - 4926.52] P:1835.84 E:0.034978 |  And naturally it is going to happen,
[4926.52 - 4928.24] P:1513.49 E:0.040311 |  but Real Madrid have responded excellently.
[4928.24 - 4930.60] P:1672.81 E:0.046879 |  They're going in front. They've knocked the ball about well.
[4930.60 - 4932.84] P:1787.86 E:0.039483 |  They look devastating on the counter attack.
[4932.84 - 4935.16] P:1683.77 E:0.050282 |  Celtic just have to deal with it. Can they get a goal back?
[4935.16 - 4937.88] P:1709.97 E:0.045208 |  So, time left in the game. Can they get a goal back
[4937.88 - 4941.84] P:1619.73 E:0.038886 |  and see if that disrupts the rhythm of Real Madrid?
[4941.84 - 4943.52] P:1612.59 E:0.032924 |  Yuranovich.
[4943.52 - 4946.44] P:1830.80 E:0.047024 |  High up the field on the right-hand side.
[4946.44 - 4948.40] P:1669.70 E:0.042290 |  Maida back to Yuranovich.
[4948.40 - 4950.56] P:1818.71 E:0.045428 |  Kartovic is across to Moritz Jens.
[4950.56 - 4954.28] P:1746.37 E:0.043969 |  Jens with a low pass to Jota wide on the left.
[4954.28 - 4956.04] P:1761.86 E:0.049269 |  Celtic nil, Real Madrid 2.
[4956.04 - 4957.72] P:1687.26 E:0.046695 |  Real Madrid have reached the knockout stages
[4957.72 - 4963.36] P:1780.90 E:0.048523 |  of the Champions League in each of the last 25 seasons.
[4963.36 - 4965.88] P:1864.20 E:0.048802 |  They've never failed to get out of the group stages.
[4965.88 - 4967.64] P:1851.25 E:0.048458 |  They're leading Celtic by two goals to nil.
[4967.64 - 4970.28] P:1887.72 E:0.047335 |  Maida O'Reilly, Celtic trying to build on the right.
[4970.28 - 4971.72] P:1675.90 E:0.045749 |  Real Madrid get in there with Mendy.
[4971.72 - 4973.16] P:1845.88 E:0.049548 |  They should be able to clear it.
[4973.16 - 4974.60] P:2013.44 E:0.037984 |  Celtic goes down.
[4974.60 - 4976.24] P:1871.19 E:0.044723 |  Goal in Seville, Conor McNamara.
[4976.24 - 4978.72] P:1520.98 E:0.053322 |  Another goal for City. Another goal for Erling Hall.
[4978.72 - 4981.60] P:1637.07 E:0.049473 |  It's Sevilla nil, Manchester City 3 now.
[4981.60 - 4984.00] P:1696.48 E:0.049276 |  And again in the poachers position after a low shot
[4984.00 - 4985.64] P:1434.69 E:0.047518 |  was parried by the goalkeeper.
[4985.68 - 4988.60] P:1644.99 E:0.047343 |  Foden drilled it in, Hall and tapped it in.
[4988.60 - 4991.80] P:1625.27 E:0.046722 |  And that is now 12 goals in his last seven games for City.
[4991.80 - 4995.64] P:1625.62 E:0.047302 |  And it's 25 goals in his 20th game of the Champions League.
[4995.64 - 4998.60] P:1668.91 E:0.044762 |  Phenomenal. Sevilla nil, Manchester City 3.
[4998.60 - 5000.48] P:2018.33 E:0.047175 |  Full time at the bet, 3-6-5.
[5000.48 - 5001.48] P:1882.96 E:0.035906 |  Gary Flintoff.
[5001.48 - 5003.68] P:1651.18 E:0.051379 |  Yep, 10 goals to nil. England win.
[5003.68 - 5007.28] P:1817.06 E:0.048276 |  Two goals to Stamway. Two goals for Bethany England.
[5007.28 - 5010.32] P:1781.77 E:0.048290 |  Two millioners to mention. USA next at Wembley.
[5010.32 - 5013.08] P:1746.62 E:0.047174 |  That'll be in the event. England 10. Luxembourg nil.
[5013.08 - 5014.28] P:1924.26 E:0.040864 |  Right, thank you, Gary.
[5014.28 - 5017.08] P:1942.97 E:0.046543 |  So, Real Madrid leading by two goals to nil.
[5017.08 - 5020.40] P:1851.44 E:0.044014 |  Karim Benzema off injured in the first half.
[5020.40 - 5022.20] P:1942.21 E:0.045798 |  Currently third highest goal scorer,
[5022.20 - 5023.96] P:1898.15 E:0.044770 |  along with Lewandowski in the Champions League.
[5023.96 - 5026.36] P:1721.96 E:0.039966 |  You wonder how many Harlem might get, don't you?
[5026.36 - 5029.32] P:1769.14 E:0.044898 |  If he stays fit. Yeah, well, he's a gold machine, isn't he?
[5029.32 - 5031.44] P:1816.19 E:0.039805 |  Comes alive. The belly touches the ball,
[5031.44 - 5033.08] P:1869.88 E:0.045463 |  but he's such a gold threat.
[5033.08 - 5036.88] P:1837.46 E:0.042420 |  And it just panics. He just worries defenders.
[5036.88 - 5040.16] P:1907.31 E:0.038880 |  Just by his presence, you look at the build.
[5040.16 - 5042.00] P:1765.36 E:0.047187 |  He shouldn't be able to do what he does.
[5042.04 - 5044.24] P:1834.09 E:0.037795 |  It should be a cent and a half.
[5044.24 - 5045.48] P:1795.05 E:0.050919 |  It should be a cent and a half.
[5045.48 - 5047.48] P:1801.51 E:0.042321 |  I bet he'd be a good one. Yeah, probably.
[5047.48 - 5050.04] P:1920.99 E:0.041261 |  But he's just such a gold machine.
[5050.04 - 5052.00] P:1678.60 E:0.035338 |  And I said this before the game.
[5052.00 - 5054.28] P:1895.89 E:0.049084 |  He will improve. There is no doubt about it.
[5054.28 - 5057.20] P:1836.22 E:0.047527 |  So that is a scary thought that he will get better.
[5057.20 - 5060.16] P:1781.76 E:0.044833 |  James McFadden former Scotland international with us at Celtic Park.
[5060.16 - 5061.56] P:1866.79 E:0.047914 |  Celtic trying to get back into the game.
[5061.56 - 5064.68] P:1770.74 E:0.041986 |  McGregor, the skipper, bringing it forward wide to Jota.
[5064.68 - 5066.68] P:1846.80 E:0.048080 |  Touch with his left boot, works it back onto the right,
[5066.68 - 5067.88] P:1830.41 E:0.044377 |  drags it back onto the left.
[5067.88 - 5069.72] P:1850.02 E:0.045688 |  Now he gets the cross into the far post.
[5069.76 - 5074.28] P:1881.09 E:0.045999 |  Jackamacus couldn't get there, and he shoved, fell on Mendy in the back.
[5074.28 - 5075.36] P:1865.04 E:0.045106 |  Referee spotted it.
[5075.36 - 5076.36] P:1628.09 E:0.044464 |  And Real Madrid, look at that.
[5076.36 - 5079.76] P:1870.10 E:0.042586 |  Real Madrid defenders sort of celebrating good defensive play
[5079.76 - 5080.88] P:1761.89 E:0.044012 |  and keeping the clean sheet.
[5080.88 - 5084.88] P:1689.13 E:0.047722 |  Diego Dallo, I saw, doing that for Manchester United the other day as well.
[5084.88 - 5086.96] P:1725.14 E:0.040904 |  Don't we sort of associate that with Real Madrid?
[5086.96 - 5088.16] P:1588.97 E:0.055281 |  No, no you don't.
[5088.16 - 5091.28] P:1657.46 E:0.037554 |  But they've made a change at half time and brought, you know,
[5091.28 - 5092.96] P:1673.02 E:0.045100 |  swapped centre-backs over,
[5092.96 - 5096.80] P:1537.83 E:0.044369 |  brought Riddigar on from Militão because Jackamacus was causing them problems.
[5096.80 - 5099.52] P:1631.10 E:0.041753 |  And Celtic are a threat on the attack.
[5099.52 - 5100.52] P:1626.46 E:0.044816 |  There's no doubt about it.
[5100.52 - 5102.84] P:1607.12 E:0.041243 |  So, yeah, they will do that.
[5102.84 - 5106.12] P:1684.84 E:0.042143 |  I think that when it's clipped to the back force and it's Jackamacus against Mendy,
[5106.12 - 5108.40] P:1709.08 E:0.041542 |  you're expecting Jackamacus to go and win it.
[5108.40 - 5111.52] P:1733.19 E:0.040611 |  So, it does well to defend, get the fill, take the pressure off
[5111.52 - 5113.36] P:1597.62 E:0.031727 |  and stop that attack by Celtic.
[5113.36 - 5115.20] P:1789.31 E:0.041450 |  Midway through the second half.
[5115.20 - 5118.20] P:1849.64 E:0.035622 |  Celtic, Niel, Real Madrid, two.
[5118.20 - 5122.72] P:1913.87 E:0.049456 |  Lights on mobile phones being switched on all around the stadium at the moment.
[5122.72 - 5127.00] P:1868.65 E:0.045056 |  They look like twinkling stars in the Glasgow night sky.
[5127.00 - 5128.32] P:1855.75 E:0.043934 |  The support has been terrific.
[5128.32 - 5130.16] P:1764.66 E:0.039291 |  It will be throughout the campaign.
[5130.16 - 5134.00] P:1726.70 E:0.048019 |  They're singing a song about the victory in 1967.
[5134.00 - 5136.40] P:1899.31 E:0.040910 |  Ah, the Lisbon Lions.
[5136.40 - 5138.52] P:1750.03 E:0.044738 |  I walked out of a different entrance actually on Saturday
[5138.52 - 5139.96] P:1699.90 E:0.046197 |  after the four-nil win against Rangers.
[5139.96 - 5145.08] P:1752.64 E:0.044495 |  There is a very simple, framed, quite small photo of that team
[5145.08 - 5146.08] P:1752.65 E:0.056955 |  with the European Cup.
[5146.08 - 5149.16] P:1742.39 E:0.045080 |  It's so simple and effective in the classes.
[5149.16 - 5152.96] P:1700.44 E:0.048140 |  It's a lovely touch and it just reminds you of what the first British team
[5152.96 - 5155.16] P:1683.11 E:0.052378 |  ever to win the European Cup, Manchester United,
[5155.16 - 5156.64] P:1640.14 E:0.048875 |  followed them the year later.
[5156.64 - 5158.52] P:1780.38 E:0.045587 |  Only two members of the squad
[5158.52 - 5160.92] P:1789.17 E:0.042407 |  bore more than 10 miles outside Glasgow.
[5160.92 - 5162.72] P:1707.17 E:0.050256 |  It's an astonishing achievement.
[5162.72 - 5164.96] P:1635.98 E:0.048584 |  It's absolutely incredible.
[5164.96 - 5167.32] P:1521.73 E:0.048552 |  And that will never happen again.
[5167.32 - 5171.20] P:1695.74 E:0.050523 |  A team, you know, you look at the fobs all around the world.
[5171.20 - 5173.24] P:1772.56 E:0.052151 |  Multinational, multicultural.
[5173.24 - 5176.08] P:1762.59 E:0.038679 |  That wouldn't happen again. Tremendous feet.
[5176.08 - 5178.24] P:1810.68 E:0.051796 |  Real Madrid playing a bit of keep ball down the left.
[5178.24 - 5181.00] P:1786.15 E:0.044516 |  Alibar is wide on the left down by the byline,
[5181.00 - 5182.56] P:1925.27 E:0.044908 |  crosses blocked by Carter Vickers
[5182.56 - 5184.56] P:1674.76 E:0.042379 |  and the ball goes behind for a corner.
[5184.60 - 5189.68] P:1845.14 E:0.044916 |  I hear that Kijogo is warming up and getting ready to go for Celtic.
[5189.68 - 5193.96] P:1943.92 E:0.044628 |  Took that awkward shoulder knock early in the Derby on Saturday.
[5193.96 - 5197.88] P:1861.99 E:0.044594 |  Celtic at home to Livingston at the weekend.
[5197.88 - 5200.12] P:1905.48 E:0.048576 |  Kamervinger's going to come on for Real Madrid.
[5200.12 - 5203.48] P:1902.73 E:0.043892 |  And next week, Celtic away to Schachtar De Nietz.
[5203.48 - 5205.76] P:1913.83 E:0.041195 |  They're away games this season in the Champions League
[5205.76 - 5210.40] P:1910.95 E:0.042572 |  because of the situation in Ukraine will be played in Poland.
[5210.40 - 5213.96] P:1884.21 E:0.040021 |  Corner taken and it's rolled back to the goalscorer of the second goal.
[5213.96 - 5217.80] P:1868.51 E:0.049954 |  Luca Modric played wide to the left and McGregor's in there,
[5217.80 - 5221.40] P:1867.65 E:0.044744 |  knocks it into the shins of the Nicious and that will be goal kick for Celtic.
[5221.40 - 5223.52] P:1856.81 E:0.046075 |  They've gone so quickly, they didn't have time to make the changes.
[5223.52 - 5226.00] P:1919.62 E:0.042133 |  They are now going to make the changes.
[5226.00 - 5232.88] P:1871.65 E:0.043508 |  So for Real Madrid, Tsuomani comes off, Kamervinger comes on.
[5232.88 - 5237.60] P:1947.22 E:0.049092 |  So 22-year-old comes off, 19-year-old comes on.
[5237.60 - 5241.52] P:1986.28 E:0.043589 |  That just shows you the talent that France have at their disposal,
[5241.56 - 5244.36] P:1916.67 E:0.041538 |  thinking the World Cup coming up in a couple of months time.
[5244.36 - 5246.40] P:1948.03 E:0.041823 |  Celtic are going to make a double change here,
[5246.40 - 5248.64] P:1956.17 E:0.040041 |  James, as you're scribbling, I'll keep talking.
[5248.64 - 5251.64] P:1868.41 E:0.035852 |  Kiyogo will come on,
[5251.64 - 5257.40] P:1891.28 E:0.039040 |  who's just been a wonderful player for Celtic since arrival last season.
[5257.40 - 5261.40] P:1868.89 E:0.047197 |  Triple change actually, David Turnbull's coming on and Aaron Moyer's coming on,
[5261.40 - 5263.20] P:1851.57 E:0.046040 |  but those changes are going to have to wait.
[5263.20 - 5266.16] P:1886.53 E:0.041113 |  So Angé Poste-Coglu is going to make a triple change.
[5266.16 - 5269.64] P:1815.22 E:0.042221 |  20 minutes to play, five live sport live at Celtic Park,
[5269.68 - 5273.52] P:1702.06 E:0.044198 |  also available on the BBC Sounds app, Celtic and Real Madrid too.
[5273.52 - 5276.80] P:1929.52 E:0.044114 |  Maida looking for a ball to O'Reilly, intercepted.
[5276.80 - 5280.36] P:1884.02 E:0.045836 |  McGregor's been so good at getting on to the loose stuff for Celtic tonight.
[5280.36 - 5282.52] P:1995.85 E:0.044058 |  Crossy, an O'Reilly looping header,
[5282.52 - 5287.32] P:1965.11 E:0.042936 |  and it bounces harmlessly behind for the goal kick to Real Madrid.
[5289.12 - 5291.00] P:1830.31 E:0.048438 |  So let's see who's coming off.
[5291.00 - 5293.48] P:2010.64 E:0.047287 |  A presumed, Jack and Matt, as well.
[5293.48 - 5296.00] P:2014.05 E:0.050159 |  Well, listen, let's try and go two up top.
[5296.00 - 5297.72] P:1963.80 E:0.051358 |  So Matt O'Reilly is one of them.
[5297.72 - 5300.76] P:2058.55 E:0.044507 |  Do you know what I was thinking about him, James, in the first half?
[5300.76 - 5305.00] P:2052.89 E:0.051364 |  Playing for M.K. Donnes at the start of this year, 21 years old,
[5305.00 - 5308.08] P:1940.11 E:0.047012 |  and here he is tonight, up against Modric and Crows.
[5308.08 - 5310.40] P:1967.30 E:0.052730 |  He's been absolutely sensational for Celtic.
[5310.40 - 5312.40] P:2010.66 E:0.048542 |  I mean, sometimes you watch him,
[5312.40 - 5314.92] P:1917.49 E:0.052191 |  and maybe he doesn't do a lot of eye-catching stuff,
[5314.92 - 5317.84] P:1909.95 E:0.053634 |  but he has been a tremendous sign for Celtic,
[5317.84 - 5321.32] P:1960.52 E:0.053528 |  and as you say, from League One to Real Madrid in a year,
[5321.32 - 5323.28] P:1888.76 E:0.048325 |  it's absolutely incredible.
[5323.28 - 5324.84] P:2019.08 E:0.049343 |  Atate is also coming off,
[5324.84 - 5326.88] P:2000.38 E:0.050173 |  Jack and Matt is coming off for Keogo,
[5326.92 - 5328.88] P:1944.22 E:0.043742 |  back to Seville, Conor McNamara.
[5328.88 - 5331.28] P:1657.39 E:0.053111 |  And we're approaching the final quarter for now,
[5331.28 - 5333.84] P:1800.62 E:0.046565 |  still Sevilla, Niel, Manchester City 3,
[5333.84 - 5336.36] P:1713.95 E:0.050429 |  two goals from Hallant, who's on yet another hat-trick now,
[5336.36 - 5339.32] P:1712.59 E:0.046879 |  and he's got time to do it, Foden got the other for City,
[5339.32 - 5342.96] P:1543.65 E:0.048286 |  and Sevilla, Don and Dostad, they've had a terrible start to the Leningen campaign.
[5342.96 - 5346.28] P:1623.34 E:0.044446 |  They are fourth bottom in the table, yet to win a game,
[5346.28 - 5347.60] P:1467.47 E:0.044696 |  and they're not coming back from this.
[5347.60 - 5349.84] P:1695.25 E:0.039959 |  Sevilla, Niel, Manchester City 3.
[5349.84 - 5351.68] P:1819.00 E:0.044592 |  Celtic, Niel, Real Madrid 2.
[5351.68 - 5354.92] P:1821.91 E:0.046716 |  Celtic having the better chances right up until the point
[5354.92 - 5356.32] P:1783.89 E:0.043774 |  that Real Madrid got there first.
[5356.32 - 5361.12] P:1742.49 E:0.043408 |  That came in the 56-minute modrige with the second in the 60th minute.
[5361.12 - 5363.40] P:1445.36 E:0.049655 |  Real Madrid on the ball.
[5363.40 - 5366.16] P:1765.67 E:0.046335 |  Chelsea losing 1-0 away to Dino Mosa,
[5366.16 - 5369.00] P:1591.73 E:0.045291 |  earlier on today, all the reaction,
[5369.00 - 5372.16] P:1597.70 E:0.047588 |  talking points, debate here on five-life sport,
[5372.16 - 5375.36] P:1731.34 E:0.043271 |  through until half past 10, also in the Football Daily podcast,
[5375.36 - 5378.12] P:1753.34 E:0.047854 |  available for you on the BBC Sounds app tomorrow.
[5378.12 - 5381.64] P:1802.11 E:0.044578 |  With that bonus Champions League away days pod,
[5381.64 - 5384.56] P:1700.22 E:0.044382 |  our two teams in Amsterdam and Naples,
[5384.60 - 5387.24] P:1764.37 E:0.049489 |  ahead of our commentaries tomorrow in the Champions League.
[5387.24 - 5389.72] P:1874.31 E:0.045101 |  Carvajal first-time ball to Modric,
[5389.72 - 5393.84] P:1805.34 E:0.044717 |  Modric wide on the right, in the right-back position for Real Madrid.
[5393.84 - 5396.00] P:1633.77 E:0.047214 |  Still had time under pressure to find the pass,
[5396.00 - 5398.12] P:1720.66 E:0.040190 |  plays it across to Hazard.
[5398.12 - 5401.32] P:1744.33 E:0.047527 |  Real Madrid are just sort of down in third gear at the moment.
[5401.32 - 5404.20] P:1671.11 E:0.043485 |  Quite happy with the lead, quite happy with the possession.
[5404.20 - 5407.72] P:1528.22 E:0.051397 |  Still have the skills of Venetius Jr. wide on the left-hand side.
[5407.72 - 5410.00] P:1553.77 E:0.052185 |  Hazard setting more and more into the game.
[5410.00 - 5413.44] P:1554.56 E:0.049120 |  Loose pass from Camarvinga, the 19-year-old who's on.
[5413.44 - 5416.56] P:1544.23 E:0.045500 |  His hair tied back in a bouncing ponytail.
[5416.56 - 5418.80] P:1708.92 E:0.047781 |  Kroos strokes the pass to Hazard.
[5418.80 - 5420.92] P:1761.63 E:0.045648 |  Little back heel flick to Camarvinga.
[5420.92 - 5423.28] P:1711.25 E:0.047946 |  Camarvinga makes his move down the left.
[5423.28 - 5425.32] P:1787.69 E:0.046908 |  Venetius tries to knock it past Uranavich.
[5425.32 - 5427.68] P:1813.59 E:0.045990 |  He makes the tackle and now all of a sudden it's Real Madrid
[5427.68 - 5429.64] P:1713.14 E:0.042802 |  looking for the quick throw on the left-hand side,
[5429.64 - 5431.48] P:1456.97 E:0.037749 |  thrown in to Hazard.
[5431.48 - 5433.80] P:1467.02 E:0.039412 |  Hazard plays it back to Camarvinga,
[5433.80 - 5436.12] P:1663.74 E:0.046488 |  inside the Celtic half, across to Kroos.
[5436.12 - 5438.12] P:1567.47 E:0.038088 |  You get the feeling that Real Madrid
[5438.12 - 5440.96] P:1598.40 E:0.045350 |  just toying with Celtic a little now.
[5440.96 - 5442.84] P:1685.58 E:0.048130 |  Valverde created that first goal,
[5442.88 - 5445.28] P:1441.31 E:0.040329 |  so brilliantly wide to Carvajal.
[5445.28 - 5447.44] P:1605.37 E:0.046544 |  Real Madrid, James, totally in control up there.
[5447.44 - 5448.44] P:1378.70 E:0.051874 |  Yeah, they are.
[5448.44 - 5451.52] P:1213.93 E:0.041272 |  They're just knocking the ball about and around the back.
[5451.52 - 5454.84] P:1453.41 E:0.046910 |  Just a pass selection and a way to pass.
[5454.84 - 5456.24] P:1578.90 E:0.051179 |  Pass it to the safe side,
[5456.24 - 5459.68] P:1423.30 E:0.045761 |  making the players' minds up for them with the passing.
[5459.68 - 5461.76] P:1390.76 E:0.042579 |  And Celtic are just dropping and dropping.
[5461.76 - 5464.12] P:1651.89 E:0.044723 |  You know that Real Madrid will just flick a switch
[5464.12 - 5465.12] P:1452.01 E:0.049788 |  and the tempo will change,
[5465.12 - 5467.16] P:1583.99 E:0.042615 |  and all of a sudden they'll have an opportunity from it,
[5467.16 - 5468.92] P:1571.94 E:0.034805 |  but they're in so much control at the minute.
[5468.92 - 5470.64] P:1770.82 E:0.048224 |  Modric curling pass down the right.
[5470.68 - 5472.88] P:1740.15 E:0.041479 |  Controlled by Camarvinga, played back to Carvajal.
[5472.88 - 5473.88] P:1794.99 E:0.044172 |  Here's Modric again.
[5473.88 - 5475.88] P:1685.78 E:0.040632 |  Let's the ball run across his body.
[5477.16 - 5479.28] P:1779.47 E:0.044673 |  Plays it to Kroos, close to Camarvinga.
[5479.28 - 5482.36] P:1894.10 E:0.042008 |  30 yards out, fouled by Jota.
[5482.36 - 5483.76] P:1874.43 E:0.045622 |  Free kick for Real Madrid.
[5483.76 - 5486.64] P:1789.88 E:0.036635 |  Celtic just desperate to try and get that ball back.
[5486.64 - 5488.96] P:1847.72 E:0.039351 |  They are just being outmaneuvered
[5488.96 - 5491.36] P:1776.30 E:0.044652 |  by a superior opponent at the moment.
[5491.36 - 5492.84] P:1844.65 E:0.049615 |  Absolutely no shame in that,
[5492.84 - 5495.04] P:1818.73 E:0.040340 |  and Celtic will fancy their chances.
[5495.04 - 5496.36] P:1836.67 E:0.050961 |  I think they're getting out of this group.
[5496.36 - 5500.48] P:1895.01 E:0.043298 |  Shakhtar Dignets are leading 2-1 away to RB Leipzig.
[5500.48 - 5502.60] P:1866.39 E:0.045322 |  Their squad Dignets got obviously much change
[5502.60 - 5504.52] P:1796.78 E:0.042391 |  because of the situation in their country.
[5504.52 - 5507.68] P:1704.75 E:0.045625 |  Leipzig not having the best of seasons in the Bundesliga.
[5507.68 - 5510.04] P:1710.20 E:0.044143 |  Next week, Celtic away to Shakhtar,
[5510.04 - 5512.32] P:1674.28 E:0.042196 |  Real Madrid at home to Leipzig.
[5512.32 - 5515.08] P:1674.95 E:0.042467 |  Free kick then around Madrid.
[5515.08 - 5517.56] P:1678.41 E:0.040722 |  David Alaba runs over it.
[5517.56 - 5520.40] P:1736.37 E:0.036047 |  Kroos rolls it to Modric.
[5520.40 - 5523.44] P:1657.75 E:0.045267 |  Stops it with his right boot back to Carvajal.
[5523.44 - 5525.40] P:1750.52 E:0.048432 |  Kroos dummies across with his right foot,
[5525.40 - 5527.76] P:1738.75 E:0.048892 |  tries the Modric with the outside of the right foot,
[5527.76 - 5529.36] P:1576.99 E:0.037717 |  quite as accurate.
[5529.36 - 5531.28] P:1435.15 E:0.044562 |  Back it comes to Mendi.
[5531.28 - 5533.36] P:1364.80 E:0.044893 |  Mendi to Modric.
[5533.36 - 5537.68] P:1417.12 E:0.046401 |  Modric just has this game in the palm of his hand,
[5537.68 - 5538.56] P:1714.70 E:0.053968 |  running operations.
[5538.56 - 5541.20] P:1571.39 E:0.046282 |  Kiyogo putting Mendi under a bit of pressure,
[5541.20 - 5543.20] P:1475.24 E:0.040330 |  saw him coming, turned away from him.
[5543.20 - 5545.20] P:1716.65 E:0.043415 |  Little one-two with Tony Kroos.
[5545.20 - 5546.88] P:1583.61 E:0.046553 |  Mendi plays wide to Camarvinga,
[5546.88 - 5549.68] P:1525.34 E:0.041553 |  Manchester City heading for three points this evening.
[5549.68 - 5552.20] P:1688.72 E:0.052506 |  Away to Sevilla leading by three goals to Nill.
[5552.20 - 5555.60] P:1504.18 E:0.041460 |  Harland has two and Foden has the other Valverde.
[5555.60 - 5557.32] P:1691.92 E:0.041211 |  Played wide to Modric.
[5557.36 - 5559.40] P:1722.08 E:0.048003 |  Steady, rhythmic, drumbeat you can hear
[5559.40 - 5561.08] P:1787.91 E:0.046236 |  in the background here at Celtic Park.
[5561.08 - 5563.92] P:1674.25 E:0.041387 |  Ashley in time with the Real Madrid passing.
[5563.92 - 5565.64] P:1695.11 E:0.048636 |  Celtic cannot get a kick at the moment.
[5565.64 - 5567.64] P:1625.34 E:0.043148 |  Camarvinga back to Kroos.
[5567.64 - 5569.96] P:1463.75 E:0.042980 |  Kroos wide to Mendi.
[5569.96 - 5571.08] P:1659.54 E:0.052909 |  Mendi to Kroos.
[5571.08 - 5575.20] P:1788.56 E:0.044033 |  Kroos drives it diagonally, high across to Venetius.
[5575.20 - 5577.44] P:1582.65 E:0.047659 |  He's swapped sides for now.
[5577.44 - 5578.76] P:1390.95 E:0.039402 |  He's wide on the right.
[5578.76 - 5581.00] P:1928.35 E:0.040353 |  Valverde's in a central position.
[5581.00 - 5583.80] P:1944.88 E:0.048303 |  Turns away from Moye, splitting pass to the right.
[5583.80 - 5585.80] P:1956.86 E:0.038504 |  Venetius just keeps it in play.
[5585.80 - 5588.44] P:1765.16 E:0.044042 |  Runs at Greg Taylor, takes him on the outside.
[5588.44 - 5591.52] P:1810.20 E:0.046254 |  Now into the penalty area, still has the ball under his spell.
[5591.52 - 5593.36] P:1868.88 E:0.049636 |  Four green and white shirts around him.
[5593.36 - 5594.80] P:1882.06 E:0.034873 |  Flicks it back to Carvajal.
[5594.80 - 5596.32] P:1921.15 E:0.041324 |  Carvajal to Modric.
[5596.32 - 5598.44] P:1980.86 E:0.046416 |  Modric outside of the right boot.
[5598.44 - 5599.60] P:1985.58 E:0.044906 |  Looking for the run of Mendi.
[5599.60 - 5601.48] P:1932.84 E:0.047607 |  That pass ended up where Mendi should have been.
[5601.48 - 5603.72] P:1916.62 E:0.041608 |  Mendi had to scamper quickly to get there.
[5603.72 - 5605.16] P:2016.07 E:0.036753 |  That's how good Modric is.
[5605.16 - 5607.32] P:1944.89 E:0.040041 |  Camarvinga back to Mendi.
[5607.32 - 5608.16] P:2008.97 E:0.048740 |  It's going to be some goal.
[5608.16 - 5610.28] P:2014.77 E:0.042581 |  I'll tell you if this ball ends up in the back of the net.
[5610.28 - 5611.76] P:2016.45 E:0.048995 |  Celtic fans getting frustrated.
[5611.76 - 5612.76] P:2014.60 E:0.043801 |  Kroos is crossed.
[5612.76 - 5613.96] P:2051.27 E:0.045681 |  Carvajal's knockback.
[5613.96 - 5615.32] P:2026.34 E:0.046376 |  Hazard scores.
[5615.32 - 5619.00] P:1975.40 E:0.049666 |  Unbelievable stuff from the European champions.
[5619.00 - 5621.40] P:1912.37 E:0.041863 |  Celtic could not get a kick.
[5621.40 - 5623.08] P:1939.34 E:0.045595 |  Pull from side to side.
[5623.08 - 5625.08] P:1912.15 E:0.045561 |  Eventually the cross comes in.
[5625.08 - 5626.32] P:1929.89 E:0.047644 |  Wonderful layoff.
[5626.32 - 5627.44] P:2201.11 E:0.042291 |  And Hazard makes it.
[5627.44 - 5628.64] P:1841.35 E:0.042099 |  Celtic nil.
[5628.64 - 5630.20] P:1796.36 E:0.047060 |  Real Madrid 3.
[5630.20 - 5631.76] P:2062.65 E:0.039235 |  Sheer, Klaas.
[5631.76 - 5633.04] P:1889.98 E:0.051086 |  Oh, you called that, Ali.
[5633.04 - 5635.04] P:1801.01 E:0.052064 |  It was a tremendous goal.
[5635.04 - 5637.16] P:1845.19 E:0.048358 |  And if you take it all the way back,
[5637.16 - 5639.12] P:1789.58 E:0.043115 |  they must have had the ball for three or four minutes,
[5639.12 - 5641.08] P:1818.55 E:0.044758 |  which is an eternity when you're chasing it
[5641.08 - 5642.32] P:1751.48 E:0.037954 |  and you're shuffling across
[5642.32 - 5644.36] P:1757.82 E:0.043712 |  and you're trying to put pressure on the ball.
[5644.40 - 5646.80] P:1825.05 E:0.048882 |  Tremendous play from Real Madrid.
[5646.80 - 5648.76] P:1865.43 E:0.043635 |  Vinicius running into the box.
[5648.76 - 5649.76] P:1805.02 E:0.058428 |  They recycle it.
[5649.76 - 5650.76] P:1836.49 E:0.043495 |  They don't force it.
[5650.76 - 5652.00] P:1841.98 E:0.048466 |  Bodies round them.
[5652.00 - 5653.84] P:1729.74 E:0.054772 |  And I mentioned this the first half.
[5653.84 - 5656.36] P:1677.17 E:0.050861 |  They look for that little diagonal for the fullback
[5656.36 - 5658.80] P:1743.61 E:0.046332 |  and for the opposite wide man getting in at the back post.
[5658.80 - 5660.16] P:1725.35 E:0.048188 |  Carvajal gets in there.
[5660.16 - 5661.56] P:1848.00 E:0.040327 |  Squares it across.
[5661.56 - 5663.88] P:1721.99 E:0.044265 |  Simplest finishes for Hazard.
[5663.88 - 5665.84] P:1570.11 E:0.050874 |  It's just a brilliant goal from Real Madrid.
[5665.84 - 5668.40] P:1824.32 E:0.031866 |  And Celtic just can't get a touch of the ball.
[5668.40 - 5672.40] P:1962.65 E:0.031543 |  So what's Celtic do to so many teams domestically?
[5672.44 - 5674.40] P:1797.54 E:0.036935 |  They're having it done to them in this second half.
[5674.40 - 5675.40] P:1709.17 E:0.043110 |  Yeah, they are.
[5675.40 - 5677.76] P:1746.12 E:0.044732 |  They are, you know, as I say, they were looking round,
[5677.76 - 5680.92] P:1832.47 E:0.045409 |  saying Celtic need to try and get a touch of the ball soon
[5680.92 - 5683.12] P:1829.09 E:0.044510 |  because they're just shuffling across.
[5683.12 - 5684.68] P:1766.83 E:0.038571 |  They're trying to put pressure on.
[5684.68 - 5687.08] P:1846.63 E:0.043668 |  Real Madrid are just stroking it about,
[5687.08 - 5689.52] P:1767.20 E:0.039442 |  not forcing it, not forcing it again.
[5689.52 - 5692.52] P:1715.77 E:0.040415 |  Like I said, flick the switch and they're in and go
[5692.52 - 5693.84] P:1376.85 E:0.039997 |  and they're three-nil off.
[5693.84 - 5695.36] P:1860.91 E:0.036739 |  It's incredible football.
[5695.36 - 5697.68] P:2144.40 E:0.052352 |  Jota, volley, cross, Kiyogo on his knee.
[5697.68 - 5699.64] P:1967.26 E:0.044704 |  Oh, got that nearly crept in.
[5699.64 - 5701.88] P:2030.28 E:0.050523 |  Scraped the outside of Courtois post.
[5701.88 - 5703.84] P:2015.02 E:0.048158 |  Immediately Celtic on the attack,
[5703.84 - 5705.64] P:1989.06 E:0.044036 |  sort of hopeful cross from Jota.
[5705.64 - 5709.16] P:1887.52 E:0.048122 |  Kiyogo kind of hit him on the left knee very nearly, went in.
[5709.16 - 5710.20] P:1686.11 E:0.050184 |  Yeah, it was good play.
[5710.20 - 5713.44] P:1593.91 E:0.040925 |  Jota left hand, Kiyogo's strength is his movement.
[5713.44 - 5715.32] P:1755.92 E:0.043004 |  It's absolutely world-class.
[5715.32 - 5716.92] P:1811.13 E:0.050458 |  It does well, we get across the front.
[5716.92 - 5720.44] P:1885.25 E:0.038284 |  It has to improvise, but it has Courtois scrambling.
[5720.44 - 5721.28] P:1700.39 E:0.055867 |  And that is better.
[5721.28 - 5724.28] P:1893.73 E:0.049715 |  Celtic need to try and hit back because I know they're losing
[5724.28 - 5726.04] P:1619.32 E:0.051388 |  three-nil and Real Madrid have been a better team,
[5726.04 - 5728.44] P:1822.67 E:0.038811 |  but Celtic played well in spells of the game.
[5728.44 - 5730.28] P:1920.75 E:0.043732 |  Turnbull, chip ball looking for Kiyogo.
[5730.32 - 5732.56] P:1925.55 E:0.043382 |  It's a straight one, too easy for Courtois to catch.
[5732.56 - 5733.52] P:1900.82 E:0.047450 |  It's beyond Kiyogo.
[5733.52 - 5737.92] P:1795.63 E:0.040271 |  Marco Asensio getting ready to come on for Real Madrid.
[5737.92 - 5741.12] P:1760.13 E:0.037365 |  13 minutes remaining in the game.
[5741.12 - 5745.12] P:1782.57 E:0.045148 |  Shakhtar-Denietz have a third goal away to Leipzig.
[5745.12 - 5747.44] P:1705.81 E:0.045831 |  Leipzig won, Shakhtar three.
[5747.44 - 5749.64] P:1837.90 E:0.047581 |  Manchester City three-nil up away to Sevilla.
[5749.64 - 5752.12] P:1727.48 E:0.041969 |  Real Madrid three-nil up on Celtic here.
[5752.12 - 5755.76] P:1771.06 E:0.040409 |  Benfica two-nil up on Maccabi-Heifer.
[5755.76 - 5759.76] P:1796.74 E:0.044033 |  Paris-Sajomar peg back off the Mbappe goals in the first half.
[5759.76 - 5762.40] P:1735.72 E:0.044478 |  They lead Juventus by two goals to one.
[5762.40 - 5764.28] P:1613.15 E:0.048858 |  Salzburg one AC Milan one.
[5764.28 - 5766.68] P:1704.85 E:0.049403 |  Chelsea beaten one-nil away to Dino Mosa,
[5766.68 - 5771.24] P:1880.85 E:0.043675 |  Rodrigo the Brazilian who scored those two heartbreaking goals
[5771.24 - 5776.12] P:1627.66 E:0.043897 |  from Manchester City fans in the semifinal second leg last season.
[5776.12 - 5778.16] P:1682.29 E:0.045190 |  He's ready to come on as well.
[5778.16 - 5781.16] P:1749.70 E:0.039339 |  Celtic three-nil down, still coming forward.
[5781.16 - 5783.32] P:1717.07 E:0.036418 |  Yuranovic plays it back to Moy.
[5783.32 - 5785.96] P:1813.86 E:0.040188 |  Quietest it's been inside Celtic Park this evening,
[5785.96 - 5788.88] P:1905.31 E:0.041917 |  but the Celtic fans, I think, have to appreciate.
[5788.88 - 5791.40] P:1956.30 E:0.040978 |  They do, I'm sure, what they're up against.
[5791.40 - 5793.80] P:1807.65 E:0.043359 |  Yeah, there's no doubt they will do.
[5793.80 - 5796.72] P:1682.55 E:0.045820 |  Celtic have been a really good performance tonight.
[5796.72 - 5799.80] P:1625.32 E:0.041335 |  They've just come up short against the holders of this tournament.
[5799.80 - 5802.08] P:1866.13 E:0.048740 |  It tells you how far Celtic have come.
[5802.08 - 5804.80] P:1904.21 E:0.047267 |  They came into this game, they had so much belief and confidence
[5804.80 - 5806.60] P:1940.22 E:0.045623 |  that they could take the game to Real Madrid,
[5806.60 - 5809.20] P:2012.85 E:0.038990 |  that they could cause them problems and they could create chances.
[5809.20 - 5811.16] P:1513.10 E:0.045363 |  They've done that, they've managed to do it,
[5811.16 - 5812.80] P:1592.79 E:0.044516 |  but just at the right moments,
[5812.80 - 5817.20] P:1894.00 E:0.042423 |  Real Madrid have shown their class and this is a team that,
[5817.20 - 5819.12] P:1740.66 E:0.058568 |  as I said, they won the competition last year,
[5819.12 - 5820.48] P:1822.44 E:0.051397 |  many didn't plan to let them do it,
[5820.48 - 5823.20] P:1989.78 E:0.053805 |  but they are a team full of world-class players.
[5823.20 - 5827.76] P:2003.68 E:0.048982 |  Celtic fans are at it again, standing ovation for Luka Modric,
[5827.76 - 5831.44] P:2017.66 E:0.045189 |  who's being taken off with just over 10 minutes to play.
[5831.44 - 5833.24] P:2057.40 E:0.053052 |  Another masterclass from him.
[5833.24 - 5835.56] P:1946.46 E:0.041666 |  I think I've said it a couple of times in the commentary,
[5835.56 - 5838.08] P:1942.57 E:0.044289 |  37 years old, he's going to be on Friday.
[5838.08 - 5841.36] P:1829.72 E:0.040424 |  Smiling a wink from Ancelotti, what a footballer,
[5841.36 - 5843.28] P:1878.95 E:0.039318 |  what a footballer Modric is,
[5843.32 - 5846.40] P:1783.05 E:0.040052 |  and Venetius Jr. gets a rest as well.
[5846.40 - 5849.84] P:1770.85 E:0.036214 |  Rodrigo plays on the left-hand side.
[5849.84 - 5854.08] P:1814.92 E:0.041080 |  Absolute pleasure to watch Modric live again this evening.
[5854.08 - 5857.44] P:1748.82 E:0.035984 |  Rudiger, a slightly different type of footballer,
[5857.44 - 5860.64] P:1863.72 E:0.043474 |  still extremely effective, back in the right-back position,
[5860.64 - 5864.08] P:1770.06 E:0.041177 |  right-footed curling pass, headed forward by Greg Taylor,
[5864.08 - 5866.56] P:1731.95 E:0.042478 |  Real Madrid leading by three goals to nil,
[5866.56 - 5869.88] P:1617.11 E:0.038930 |  and Kroos plays it out to the left to Mending.
[5870.88 - 5874.48] P:1731.37 E:0.047210 |  Haksabanovich, one of the new signings, the Montenegro.
[5874.48 - 5878.20] P:1670.79 E:0.043317 |  Seyad Haksabanovich, previously at West Ham,
[5878.20 - 5880.08] P:1805.19 E:0.040442 |  joined Celtic in the summer,
[5880.08 - 5884.04] P:1524.64 E:0.040250 |  is going to get a little run-out late in the game this evening.
[5884.04 - 5887.08] P:1483.74 E:0.046834 |  Tomorrow, keep reminding you, on air from Huffbus 5,
[5887.08 - 5888.72] P:1620.11 E:0.036759 |  Mark Chapman in the hot seat,
[5888.72 - 5891.96] P:1677.87 E:0.041403 |  Rangers start the group campaign away to Ajax,
[5891.96 - 5894.32] P:1581.79 E:0.048062 |  and then at 8 o'clock, our commentary live from Naples,
[5894.32 - 5896.20] P:1726.06 E:0.045069 |  Ian Dennis and Jonathan Woodgate
[5896.20 - 5899.04] P:1742.43 E:0.046341 |  will bring you Napoli against Liverpool,
[5899.20 - 5901.92] P:1764.63 E:0.042696 |  with John Murray at the Tottenham-Hotspur Stadium,
[5901.92 - 5904.84] P:1678.35 E:0.046982 |  bringing you Tottenham-Marseille updates.
[5904.84 - 5907.76] P:1829.04 E:0.039527 |  Turnbull, nice pass to his left, a jotter.
[5907.76 - 5910.08] P:1860.77 E:0.045241 |  Little flick from Jotter to beat Carvajal,
[5910.08 - 5913.64] P:1750.34 E:0.040122 |  right-footed curling cross is headed away by Alaba,
[5913.64 - 5918.24] P:1966.34 E:0.044633 |  Aaron Moy, 31-year-old Australian international,
[5918.24 - 5920.08] P:1724.13 E:0.046140 |  stretches for it, plays it to Yuranovic,
[5920.08 - 5921.36] P:1792.05 E:0.044283 |  cut back towards McGregor.
[5921.36 - 5923.04] P:1817.17 E:0.043158 |  McGregor had to fight to win that ball.
[5923.04 - 5926.04] P:1938.36 E:0.042412 |  So does Greg Taylor, does it, gets himself on his feet,
[5926.04 - 5926.88] P:1854.25 E:0.050450 |  plays it to Jotter,
[5926.88 - 5929.48] P:1997.68 E:0.045889 |  can Celtic score a killing shot over the bar?
[5929.48 - 5930.48] P:2007.04 E:0.041881 |  Harper-Charks.
[5930.48 - 5933.32] P:1913.13 E:0.052029 |  That is, and it did get a lot better scrappy,
[5933.32 - 5934.96] P:1821.29 E:0.050136 |  but Celtic are winning the tackles.
[5934.96 - 5938.68] P:1784.31 E:0.053196 |  It comes to Jotter, Dyson Maida just made a run to the back post
[5938.68 - 5941.64] P:1853.37 E:0.051312 |  and it gets his head up and clips it towards the back post.
[5941.64 - 5944.96] P:2002.65 E:0.053758 |  He's all on his own, but Celtic again, hitting back.
[5944.96 - 5947.16] P:1973.35 E:0.050731 |  Man, it's just had the shotters coming off.
[5948.44 - 5951.92] P:1944.35 E:0.054089 |  And it's a chance for the home fans to see their new signing.
[5951.92 - 5954.96] P:1948.57 E:0.050634 |  Yeah, Haksabanovich, 23-years-old,
[5955.04 - 5957.88] P:1933.31 E:0.050962 |  one substitute appearance for the club so far in the lead cup
[5957.88 - 5960.84] P:1947.37 E:0.051710 |  against Ross County, not being rude to Ross County.
[5960.84 - 5963.92] P:2021.38 E:0.048367 |  This is a slightly different footballing experience.
[5963.92 - 5966.40] P:1815.48 E:0.043304 |  Yeah, just a bit, just a bit.
[5966.40 - 5969.96] P:1720.29 E:0.044601 |  But it gives them a chance to go and get a run out,
[5969.96 - 5972.16] P:1790.60 E:0.046892 |  go on the ball, allow the fans to see them.
[5972.16 - 5974.28] P:1630.21 E:0.052220 |  I think they were really excited to root the sore
[5974.28 - 5975.64] P:1927.95 E:0.033518 |  against Ross County.
[5975.64 - 5977.84] P:1900.49 E:0.045376 |  So, yeah, it's a chance for them to see what he's like
[5977.84 - 5980.80] P:1806.63 E:0.037014 |  in this kind of occasion.
[5980.80 - 5982.88] P:1907.41 E:0.043675 |  Rudiger put under a bit of pressure by that throw-in,
[5982.88 - 5985.08] P:2067.74 E:0.046196 |  plays it back to Kortar and says the pressure's all yours.
[5985.08 - 5987.36] P:1941.05 E:0.041140 |  Kortar says, don't worry about it, I'll deal with it.
[5987.36 - 5989.68] P:1955.92 E:0.048876 |  And Kroos loses it inside his own penalty area now,
[5989.68 - 5992.00] P:1819.36 E:0.038907 |  and Rudiger shepherds the ball back to Kortar.
[5992.00 - 5994.24] P:1939.01 E:0.037779 |  So just a slight lack of concentration,
[5994.24 - 5995.48] P:1809.45 E:0.050131 |  a bit sloppy from Real Madrid,
[5995.48 - 5998.40] P:1699.45 E:0.038318 |  but Celtic can't quite take advantage.
[5998.40 - 6000.80] P:1790.53 E:0.045596 |  Eight minutes or so remaining in the game.
[6000.80 - 6002.52] P:1785.76 E:0.047371 |  Celtic well-beaten in the second half,
[6002.52 - 6006.48] P:1739.16 E:0.041374 |  goals from Venetius Junior, Luka Modric and Eddin Hazard.
[6006.48 - 6009.12] P:1735.60 E:0.041842 |  Just reading those names out tells you, you know,
[6009.12 - 6011.76] P:1884.26 E:0.039342 |  the class that Celtic have been up against this evening.
[6011.80 - 6013.80] P:1898.54 E:0.050323 |  Haksabanovich on the ball, needs a bit of support,
[6013.80 - 6015.36] P:1989.56 E:0.044935 |  his bright yellow boost as well.
[6015.36 - 6018.44] P:2021.51 E:0.037841 |  Holds onto it, Kamavinga comes in, clumsy challenge.
[6018.44 - 6021.80] P:1803.80 E:0.035914 |  And Celtic win a free kick wide on the left-hand side.
[6021.80 - 6025.80] P:1708.15 E:0.041191 |  And Celtic have just continued to do what they've done from the start.
[6025.80 - 6028.76] P:1828.68 E:0.042574 |  You know, they're still pushing the full backs forward,
[6028.76 - 6031.36] P:1832.52 E:0.038792 |  they're still trying to attack, they're still trying to, you know,
[6031.36 - 6034.28] P:1533.75 E:0.045768 |  play their way, and it's something that we've spoken about at length.
[6034.28 - 6037.84] P:1678.85 E:0.043059 |  The manager demands that off the players, and they will keep going.
[6037.84 - 6041.36] P:1413.31 E:0.043910 |  It doesn't matter if Real Madrid are still going to hit them on the break,
[6041.36 - 6043.36] P:1637.56 E:0.040467 |  and look dangerous on the counter-attack,
[6043.36 - 6045.28] P:1733.76 E:0.039904 |  Celtic are still trying to find a way.
[6045.28 - 6048.48] P:1589.23 E:0.045005 |  Potentially, however slim it is, back into the game,
[6048.48 - 6051.72] P:1778.87 E:0.044401 |  maybe just to get a goal and get a reward for their good play,
[6051.72 - 6053.80] P:1841.79 E:0.039851 |  but they will continue to play this way,
[6053.80 - 6055.36] P:1765.58 E:0.043269 |  no matter what the score line is.
[6055.36 - 6058.96] P:1861.13 E:0.036056 |  James McFadden with us here at Celtic Park.
[6058.96 - 6061.80] P:1623.30 E:0.039447 |  Celtic, Niel Real Madrid, three.
[6061.80 - 6064.96] P:1711.91 E:0.037856 |  Sevilla, Niel Manchester City, three.
[6064.96 - 6067.76] P:1582.17 E:0.051298 |  At the Ramon Sanchez, piss-one this evening,
[6067.76 - 6069.36] P:1650.12 E:0.047917 |  Erling Haaland looking for another hat-trick,
[6069.36 - 6073.96] P:1584.96 E:0.044232 |  unless he's already been substituted by Pep Guardiola.
[6073.96 - 6075.96] P:1782.17 E:0.035617 |  Jones is just going to have a little flick and a look.
[6075.96 - 6077.96] P:1717.31 E:0.045563 |  Connor Maywell have mentioned it, and I miss it.
[6077.96 - 6081.16] P:1720.82 E:0.042595 |  He's gone off as he's a no-champions league hat-trick.
[6081.16 - 6083.96] P:1821.02 E:0.049523 |  First one for Manchester City for Haaland tonight.
[6083.96 - 6089.36] P:1830.72 E:0.043660 |  He is off. He will face Borussia Dortmund in a commentary next week.
[6089.36 - 6092.56] P:1720.02 E:0.043139 |  Four-one to Schachtar, a way to leipsic.
[6092.56 - 6094.96] P:1772.93 E:0.048396 |  That is some result for Schachtar than yet this evening.
[6094.96 - 6098.56] P:1812.02 E:0.043090 |  So, Real Madrid and Schachtar will be off to a winning start
[6098.96 - 6099.96] P:1788.64 E:0.050924 |  in this group.
[6099.96 - 6103.76] P:1842.09 E:0.038766 |  Courtois has the ball at his feet. The big Belgian chips it out to the left.
[6103.76 - 6108.16] P:1796.24 E:0.044310 |  Mendy controls it, knocks it past Maida, collects it the other side.
[6108.16 - 6112.36] P:1766.29 E:0.043910 |  Again, moving at sort of 75, 80% there.
[6112.36 - 6113.76] P:1829.49 E:0.041895 |  Back to Courtois.
[6113.76 - 6116.16] P:1823.57 E:0.049019 |  Courtois this time decides to go long down the middle.
[6116.16 - 6117.96] P:1810.29 E:0.046979 |  Rodrigo's waiting for that ball to land.
[6117.96 - 6119.36] P:1870.76 E:0.048844 |  He's in an offside position.
[6119.36 - 6124.76] P:1742.51 E:0.031900 |  Flag goes up, whistle blows, free kick for Celtic.
[6124.76 - 6128.36] P:1701.10 E:0.043632 |  Not a single. I mean, Celtic fans, well, a couple possibly.
[6128.36 - 6129.96] P:1605.03 E:0.049430 |  I can see on the far side of the ground leaving.
[6129.96 - 6132.56] P:1613.33 E:0.044791 |  This stadium is still absolutely packed with the team 3-0 down.
[6132.56 - 6136.56] P:1714.33 E:0.044242 |  Yeah, and as much as you don't want to see your team losing,
[6136.56 - 6141.36] P:1838.13 E:0.037742 |  they'll be proud of the performance that the team have put in.
[6141.36 - 6143.36] P:1899.85 E:0.047660 |  Taylor's ball to Haksabanovich is a good one.
[6143.36 - 6145.96] P:1880.54 E:0.051378 |  Haksabanovich in the penalty, a drag-back onto his left foot shoots.
[6145.96 - 6148.16] P:1994.47 E:0.043696 |  Oh, Courtois, what a save at the near post.
[6148.16 - 6150.36] P:1966.87 E:0.047832 |  Haksabanovich tried to beat him for power.
[6150.36 - 6152.76] P:1990.40 E:0.049706 |  Courtois stuck an arm up and made the block.
[6152.76 - 6156.16] P:1964.66 E:0.047852 |  That was so nearly a wonderful goal for Haksabanovich.
[6156.16 - 6158.96] P:1610.41 E:0.053229 |  Now, Wattersby is an unbelievable save from Courtois
[6158.96 - 6159.96] P:1693.90 E:0.058138 |  because it does really well.
[6159.96 - 6162.56] P:1825.51 E:0.046749 |  Haksabanovich looks like he's going to cross at his right,
[6162.56 - 6165.76] P:1586.01 E:0.047814 |  drags it onto his left and just fires at that near post.
[6165.76 - 6168.96] P:1708.15 E:0.048501 |  Courtois just puts up his right hand, the reaction and the power
[6168.96 - 6170.76] P:1799.97 E:0.047050 |  that's strengthening his arm to keep that out.
[6170.76 - 6171.96] P:1677.56 E:0.038735 |  It's an incredible save.
[6171.96 - 6173.96] P:1811.75 E:0.045543 |  Yeah, as if the outfield players, the attacking players,
[6173.96 - 6177.16] P:1851.29 E:0.041706 |  weren't good enough, he's still going to try and beat Courtois as well.
[6177.16 - 6180.36] P:1877.20 E:0.040946 |  Kept that clean sheet for Athletico Madrid at this stadium.
[6180.36 - 6184.36] P:1665.16 E:0.047159 |  Back in November 2011, here he is 11 years on,
[6184.36 - 6186.56] P:1712.40 E:0.046523 |  doing the same for Rao Madrid.
[6186.56 - 6189.76] P:1771.98 E:0.035962 |  So Celtic nil, Rao Madrid 3,
[6189.76 - 6193.56] P:1780.51 E:0.044209 |  terms of your Premier League action on the way this weekend.
[6193.56 - 6195.96] P:1767.47 E:0.043351 |  3 o'clock commentary on Saturday.
[6195.96 - 6198.76] P:1908.12 E:0.047601 |  Actually, those of us Celtic and Rangers leaning will have spotted
[6198.76 - 6200.76] P:1914.08 E:0.046710 |  it's Brendan Rodgers against Stephen Gerrard.
[6200.76 - 6202.96] P:1795.08 E:0.037227 |  Lester Villers are 3 o'clock commentary.
[6202.96 - 6205.56] P:1750.94 E:0.047187 |  We've got Manchester City Tottenham in full at 1.5,
[6205.56 - 6207.16] P:1692.71 E:0.035075 |  which should be fascinating.
[6207.16 - 6210.56] P:1748.08 E:0.044493 |  Sunday two games, Arsenal-Everton kicks off at 2 o'clock.
[6210.56 - 6213.36] P:1691.43 E:0.046788 |  Crystal Palace Manchester United is on a 1.5 plus 4 commentary.
[6213.56 - 6217.16] P:1729.52 E:0.044850 |  I know Steve Crossman has done an interview with Ben White this morning.
[6217.16 - 6219.96] P:1614.48 E:0.045077 |  You're here on Five Lives Premier League Sunday,
[6219.96 - 6222.16] P:1715.96 E:0.045116 |  which I'm told will be a good listen.
[6222.16 - 6225.56] P:1739.83 E:0.048203 |  Steve appeared on the Fantasy 606 podcast recording this morning.
[6225.56 - 6228.16] P:1765.19 E:0.042189 |  That'll be out on Thursday on BBC Sounds.
[6228.16 - 6231.56] P:1643.92 E:0.044318 |  James tells me he's not playing this season, which is disappointing,
[6231.56 - 6233.36] P:1614.55 E:0.043702 |  because I know he was playing last season,
[6233.36 - 6235.96] P:1389.21 E:0.045185 |  but some other members of the family I think are involved, aren't they?
[6235.96 - 6237.56] P:1492.88 E:0.054468 |  Yeah, my son plays.
[6237.56 - 6239.16] P:1483.09 E:0.042927 |  My two sons play it.
[6239.16 - 6242.16] P:1391.32 E:0.049319 |  I just, according to that many games, I don't have time to be worrying
[6242.16 - 6244.56] P:1691.88 E:0.049233 |  about who I should sob and who my captain is.
[6244.56 - 6247.16] P:1454.58 E:0.046216 |  I understand how it works. I just don't have time to play it.
[6247.16 - 6249.36] P:1746.69 E:0.044948 |  Camarvinger on the ball for Rayon Madrid.
[6249.36 - 6251.36] P:1712.85 E:0.038878 |  Five minutes remaining in the game.
[6251.36 - 6256.76] P:1630.91 E:0.041088 |  Celtic nil, Rayon Madrid three, and Rayon Madrid third goal.
[6256.76 - 6258.56] P:1785.86 E:0.045906 |  Just quite incredible, as James was saying,
[6258.56 - 6261.76] P:1681.54 E:0.044341 |  had possession for three, four minutes without Celtic getting a kick,
[6261.76 - 6265.56] P:1618.79 E:0.042632 |  and eventually picked their moment to score a sensio.
[6265.56 - 6268.56] P:1549.67 E:0.038850 |  Wide on the right-hand side.
[6268.56 - 6271.36] P:1795.32 E:0.049172 |  Just singing starting up again from the Celtic fans.
[6271.36 - 6274.96] P:1699.44 E:0.038709 |  Kroos plays it to Hazard.
[6274.96 - 6278.56] P:1642.39 E:0.046033 |  I think his performance tonight will have done him some good in the goal as well.
[6278.56 - 6280.36] P:1672.47 E:0.047220 |  Yeah, Hazard's looked really sharp.
[6280.36 - 6284.36] P:1604.86 E:0.043111 |  He has, you know, struggled to get into the game at the start, as you couldn't.
[6284.36 - 6285.36] P:1765.66 E:0.052259 |  Layoff.
[6285.36 - 6288.36] P:1930.05 E:0.043771 |  So, a sensio hits the shot to the near post. Johar makes the save.
[6288.36 - 6291.36] P:1792.49 E:0.052872 |  Yeah, you know, Hazard's looked really sharp.
[6291.36 - 6294.76] P:1571.46 E:0.048546 |  He looked like the Hazard of old, and he's having to play in an unfamiliar position
[6294.76 - 6296.76] P:1551.84 E:0.049807 |  straight through the middle as a number nine,
[6296.76 - 6298.56] P:1591.17 E:0.037688 |  but some of his touches have been great.
[6298.56 - 6301.16] P:1716.24 E:0.042451 |  He looks sharp, he looks fit, he looks lean,
[6301.16 - 6303.96] P:1702.52 E:0.042895 |  and that can only be a good thing for Rayon Madrid.
[6303.96 - 6306.36] P:1680.89 E:0.043115 |  And it's great to see you because he's a terrific footballer.
[6306.36 - 6307.36] P:1663.49 E:0.051130 |  Oh, yeah.
[6307.36 - 6308.76] P:1821.69 E:0.035253 |  He's a joy to watch when he's at full flight.
[6308.76 - 6312.16] P:1691.64 E:0.043206 |  Callum McGregor plays to Haksabanovich on the edge of the Rayon Madrid box.
[6312.16 - 6315.16] P:1829.60 E:0.045658 |  McGregor continues the run, gets it back, cut back here to Maida.
[6315.16 - 6319.16] P:1897.92 E:0.042206 |  Had a swing with his left foot, made contact, skewed it wide.
[6319.16 - 6321.56] P:1858.75 E:0.050652 |  Goes behind for a goal kick to Rayon Madrid.
[6321.56 - 6324.16] P:1764.72 E:0.049837 |  Celtic nil, Rayon Madrid three.
[6324.56 - 6325.76] P:1760.30 E:0.057787 |  I'm just going to try and bring Roddy in.
[6325.76 - 6327.96] P:1960.94 E:0.053173 |  What have you spotted Roddy on the BBC Sport website there?
[6327.96 - 6329.96] P:1977.49 E:0.055511 |  Yeah, it's on the BBC Scotland website.
[6329.96 - 6333.56] P:1949.16 E:0.053306 |  36 years and 362 days.
[6333.56 - 6336.96] P:1935.36 E:0.054481 |  Look at Modric, he's the oldest player to score for Rayon Madrid
[6336.96 - 6342.36] P:1914.88 E:0.051591 |  in the European Cup or Champions League since Berends Pruskas did it in September 1965.
[6342.36 - 6345.76] P:1870.97 E:0.056890 |  And of course, Pruskas is Andrew's former manager.
[6345.76 - 6347.36] P:1971.64 E:0.049508 |  That's right, managed him himself.
[6347.36 - 6350.56] P:1908.51 E:0.053335 |  Melburn also enjoyed a very good night in Scotland, didn't he?
[6350.56 - 6354.16] P:1811.73 E:0.046878 |  Back in 1963 in the European Cup,
[6354.16 - 6356.56] P:1760.44 E:0.045171 |  Rayon Madrid won two of their European Cups in Scotland.
[6356.56 - 6359.56] P:1718.68 E:0.039768 |  The famous win against Eintracht Frankfurt.
[6359.56 - 6363.96] P:1817.07 E:0.044522 |  They pushed for Scott Four that night and Stefano got three.
[6363.96 - 6369.76] P:1654.11 E:0.046269 |  They also won it with the magical Zidane Folly against Leverkusen at Hamden Park in 2002.
[6369.76 - 6372.96] P:1729.01 E:0.039504 |  So there's a big link between the two clubs.
[6372.96 - 6375.36] P:1738.72 E:0.044580 |  Rayon Madrid getting the three points tonight,
[6375.36 - 6378.16] P:1922.41 E:0.044814 |  closing stages of the game here on five live in BBC Sounds,
[6378.16 - 6379.56] P:1663.37 E:0.044646 |  on air through until Huffpust 10.
[6379.56 - 6382.96] P:1909.49 E:0.045433 |  Manchester City getting their win three-nil up away to Sevilla.
[6382.96 - 6385.96] P:1953.85 E:0.032912 |  Chelsea beaten by a goal to nil.
[6385.96 - 6389.56] P:1860.78 E:0.038565 |  And here's Carter Vickers coming forward to Maida.
[6389.56 - 6391.36] P:1863.89 E:0.033825 |  Celtic keep going.
[6391.36 - 6393.76] P:1873.97 E:0.045847 |  Yuranovic, who actually in the last Celtic move,
[6393.76 - 6399.56] P:1822.17 E:0.040536 |  I think must have covered 100 metres down the right-hand side in like 10 or 11.
[6399.56 - 6403.16] P:1747.57 E:0.045298 |  I mean, incredible pace, incredible energy at the end of the game.
[6403.16 - 6406.96] P:1862.89 E:0.043282 |  Firland Mende, lovely ball with his left foot to Rodrigo.
[6407.96 - 6409.36] P:1770.48 E:0.045394 |  Stepping over, right footed.
[6409.36 - 6413.76] P:1931.78 E:0.042064 |  Carter, just wide, could have been four-nil, goes behind for the goal kick.
[6413.76 - 6415.76] P:1860.62 E:0.056081 |  Yeah, could have been in Yuranovic.
[6415.76 - 6418.16] P:1747.86 E:0.051720 |  The man you're just speaking about is on the attack.
[6418.16 - 6421.96] P:1874.77 E:0.050811 |  And he manages to get back just in line as he hits the shot.
[6421.96 - 6424.36] P:1756.33 E:0.055873 |  And Rayon Madrid have looked good on the counter.
[6424.36 - 6429.56] P:1906.73 E:0.052520 |  You know, I have to say, I think Celtic have had as many good chances as Rayon Madrid.
[6429.56 - 6430.96] P:1754.14 E:0.051741 |  They just haven't been clinical.
[6430.96 - 6433.56] P:1834.00 E:0.049262 |  Maida down the right, cross comes in.
[6433.56 - 6435.96] P:1914.88 E:0.052517 |  Max Savanovich trying to attack it at the far post,
[6435.96 - 6438.16] P:1897.90 E:0.053327 |  headed behind by Rudiger, corner for Celtic.
[6438.16 - 6439.56] P:1798.87 E:0.049876 |  Listen to this place.
[6439.56 - 6443.36] P:1909.82 E:0.054336 |  This is the losing three-nil, singing for the manager.
[6443.36 - 6447.76] P:1883.10 E:0.055417 |  That shows you the appreciation these fans have got from what they've seen tonight.
[6447.76 - 6449.96] P:1936.01 E:0.056634 |  Two minutes of added time, the roof will come off.
[6449.96 - 6451.76] P:1984.43 E:0.051759 |  We always say it if Celtic score here.
[6451.76 - 6454.36] P:1979.87 E:0.047814 |  Moise curling ball, Kiyogo looks for the flick on.
[6454.36 - 6456.96] P:1851.19 E:0.046226 |  Tebow Kortua behind him, punches it away.
[6456.96 - 6460.76] P:1861.23 E:0.044836 |  Kamovinger, first-time clearance, up towards the halfway line.
[6460.76 - 6466.16] P:1821.82 E:0.041791 |  Greg Taylor intercepts it, knocks the pass to Haksabanovich, runs into Kamovinger.
[6466.16 - 6468.16] P:1822.48 E:0.044398 |  Play-on says the referee, turn ball.
[6468.16 - 6471.36] P:1912.23 E:0.044750 |  Back to Haksabanovich, all he just tries to slide it to McGregor, gets it there in the end.
[6471.36 - 6473.56] P:1888.76 E:0.050462 |  McGregor, back to Haksabanovich, sliding challenge on him.
[6473.56 - 6474.76] P:1899.34 E:0.044749 |  I think it was a clean one.
[6474.76 - 6477.96] P:2003.51 E:0.044633 |  Alaba takes the ball, referee says, get yourself up,
[6477.96 - 6481.36] P:2028.91 E:0.044041 |  and the ball goes behind for a goal kick to Rayon Madrid.
[6481.36 - 6483.16] P:2045.68 E:0.049894 |  They lead Celtic by three goals to Nile.
[6483.16 - 6484.96] P:1998.32 E:0.047635 |  Do Manchester City have a fourth in Seville?
[6484.96 - 6485.96] P:1933.33 E:0.046155 |  Got a McNamara.
[6485.96 - 6487.76] P:1888.54 E:0.053758 |  They do. Two minutes into stoppage time.
[6487.76 - 6489.96] P:1859.27 E:0.055299 |  Sevilla Nile, Manchester City four.
[6489.96 - 6491.56] P:2022.24 E:0.050783 |  The demolition is complete.
[6491.56 - 6496.36] P:1900.04 E:0.059036 |  Ruben Diaz tapping in from close range after another slick build-up.
[6496.36 - 6498.76] P:1937.51 E:0.057492 |  City many people's favourites to go win the tournament.
[6498.76 - 6500.56] P:1897.26 E:0.055573 |  They are starting in style.
[6500.56 - 6503.16] P:1924.78 E:0.057029 |  Sevilla Nile, Manchester City four.
[6503.16 - 6504.56] P:1941.68 E:0.039894 |  Thank you, Conor.
[6504.56 - 6510.56] P:1937.49 E:0.050194 |  James McFarren has just taken the headphones off just to have a listen in the roar to the noise.
[6510.56 - 6515.76] P:1899.44 E:0.046688 |  Unbelievable support for Celtic, who really were having the better of the chances,
[6515.76 - 6518.16] P:1791.06 E:0.047010 |  right up until Rayon Madrid scored the first.
[6518.16 - 6522.96] P:1783.08 E:0.046252 |  Then Rayon Madrid have taken them apart, but they can do that to absolutely any team.
[6522.96 - 6526.96] P:1767.57 E:0.045294 |  Closing stages of the game, probably about 30-40 seconds to go.
[6526.96 - 6529.16] P:1782.99 E:0.044923 |  Celtic Nile, Rayon Madrid three.
[6529.16 - 6533.76] P:1663.56 E:0.043747 |  Celtic away to Shakhtar next week in their next Champions League game.
[6533.76 - 6537.76] P:1668.74 E:0.046015 |  Here's Valverde, Rayon Madrid keeping it at the moment inside the Celtic half.
[6537.76 - 6540.76] P:1871.00 E:0.049534 |  Flick back to Carvajal, five times Champions League winner.
[6540.76 - 6541.96] P:1803.91 E:0.043720 |  He'll win a sixth.
[6541.96 - 6544.16] P:1714.35 E:0.057709 |  Wow, I got it. That is incredible.
[6544.56 - 6548.36] P:1646.59 E:0.056087 |  This is a full stadium, watching the team lose.
[6548.36 - 6552.76] P:1851.20 E:0.049631 |  Three now, and they are going crazy for the manager.
[6552.76 - 6556.16] P:1775.44 E:0.052989 |  It shows you what this man has done in one year.
[6556.16 - 6558.36] P:1767.67 E:0.050357 |  One year, it's absolutely incredible.
[6558.36 - 6562.36] P:1736.82 E:0.044051 |  The great quote from him yesterday about expectations is,
[6562.36 - 6564.76] P:1657.85 E:0.041903 |  why would I burst people's bubbles?
[6564.76 - 6566.56] P:1726.66 E:0.049632 |  They have enough of that in their normal lives.
[6566.56 - 6569.16] P:1988.60 E:0.050693 |  They come to Celtic Park to be entertained.
[6569.16 - 6570.76] P:1900.82 E:0.048559 |  They've been entertained tonight.
[6570.76 - 6573.96] P:1895.94 E:0.056431 |  In the end, they've been beaten by the European Champions.
[6573.96 - 6576.16] P:1918.11 E:0.049100 |  Absolutely no disgrace in that.
[6576.16 - 6579.36] P:1903.29 E:0.051226 |  Callum McGregor with a rasping shot against the post,
[6579.36 - 6580.96] P:1897.96 E:0.050804 |  could have given Celtic the lead.
[6580.96 - 6582.96] P:1945.20 E:0.048070 |  They had other chances in the game,
[6582.96 - 6586.36] P:1923.43 E:0.049561 |  and then suddenly two goals in four minutes,
[6586.36 - 6588.36] P:1893.63 E:0.049279 |  and Rayon Madrid were away in the second half.
[6588.36 - 6591.16] P:1878.78 E:0.052965 |  Venetius Jr. with the first, Luka Modric.
[6591.16 - 6593.16] P:1850.77 E:0.044833 |  What a fabulous play he is.
[6593.16 - 6596.36] P:1869.26 E:0.048973 |  Obvious thing to say with the second goal to make it 2-0.
[6596.36 - 6600.16] P:1919.52 E:0.046182 |  And Eddin Hazard looking sharp again, got the third.
[6600.16 - 6601.96] P:1867.07 E:0.054188 |  Really entertaining evening of football.
[6601.96 - 6604.16] P:1902.22 E:0.054026 |  And James, I can tell you've enjoyed it,
[6604.16 - 6606.16] P:1868.11 E:0.051957 |  but you've really been struck by this support
[6606.16 - 6607.56] P:2063.38 E:0.048380 |  right at the end for Celtic, haven't you?
[6607.56 - 6611.16] P:1777.87 E:0.051062 |  Yeah, it's been a terrific game, a really good performance.
[6611.16 - 6615.36] P:1916.66 E:0.045019 |  Created really good opportunities, particularly in the first half,
[6615.36 - 6617.56] P:1898.76 E:0.044280 |  unlucky not to go in front.
[6617.56 - 6622.36] P:1859.60 E:0.045417 |  But the crowd have stayed behind to show the support for the team,
[6622.36 - 6627.16] P:1701.80 E:0.044440 |  to show their appreciation for the job that this manager has done for them.
[6627.16 - 6629.96] P:1942.21 E:0.047135 |  You know, he keeps speaking about it, he won't change.
[6630.16 - 6632.76] P:1809.48 E:0.044685 |  He's got to style a football, they won't change from it.
[6632.76 - 6635.96] P:1776.11 E:0.050319 |  They'll approach every game the same, they'll go and take on Rayon Madrid,
[6635.96 - 6638.16] P:1790.33 E:0.043058 |  they'll go and see and test themselves against them.
[6638.16 - 6641.16] P:1892.71 E:0.050086 |  What they'll learn tonight is they're a very good side.
[6641.16 - 6642.76] P:1878.37 E:0.047442 |  They are well on the way.
[6642.76 - 6646.36] P:1901.22 E:0.048559 |  And to get the appreciation and the adulation from the crowd,
[6646.36 - 6648.96] P:1925.09 E:0.048463 |  it reinforces that for them.
[6648.96 - 6650.96] P:1971.43 E:0.048844 |  Terrific performance, just unlucky,
[6650.96 - 6654.36] P:1883.09 E:0.050395 |  our unfortunate sorry to be on the end of a 3-0 scoreline,
[6654.36 - 6656.76] P:1936.25 E:0.049533 |  but this club is going the right direction.
[6656.76 - 6659.76] P:1820.83 E:0.050149 |  And I've never seen so many fans stay this long after the defeat.
[6660.56 - 6662.56] P:1954.80 E:0.048798 |  Rodney Passai, what did you make of it?
[6662.56 - 6666.56] P:1962.49 E:0.051910 |  For me, the turning point was Mayda's mischievous after half-time,
[6666.56 - 6669.56] P:1979.18 E:0.052749 |  because Serti had come out the way they had come out in the first half,
[6669.56 - 6671.56] P:1901.29 E:0.052666 |  they were looking as likely to score.
[6671.56 - 6674.56] P:1987.37 E:0.051269 |  It was harder for him not to score than it was to put it behind Kortwa.
[6674.56 - 6677.56] P:1986.15 E:0.056794 |  That said, look at the fans on that side.
[6677.56 - 6680.56] P:1954.59 E:0.053908 |  Serti, Kortwa, my goodness.
[6680.56 - 6682.56] P:1968.25 E:0.053011 |  And Kortwa.
[6682.56 - 6684.56] P:2025.91 E:0.058927 |  And all of the Tore, they all asked,
[6684.56 - 6687.56] P:1959.39 E:0.056516 |  I was about to say that when we looked at this group when it was drawn,
[6687.56 - 6689.56] P:1882.17 E:0.053732 |  we never doubted that Real Madrid would qualify.
[6689.56 - 6692.56] P:1967.91 E:0.049322 |  Celtic were four seats, it was going to be a hard shift for them,
[6692.56 - 6694.56] P:1980.00 E:0.054116 |  but Leipzig looked vulnerable.
[6694.56 - 6697.56] P:1907.86 E:0.054484 |  They'd been beaten by Rangers in the Europa League semi-finals last season.
[6697.56 - 6700.56] P:1977.62 E:0.052265 |  If Rangers could do it, Celtic felt they could do it.
[6700.56 - 6702.56] P:1992.11 E:0.051435 |  Now the group has been bust open by Shakhtar, Danez,
[6702.56 - 6706.56] P:1936.17 E:0.052292 |  when in Leipzig, and the pressure is on Celtic next week in Poland.
[6706.56 - 6709.56] P:2005.84 E:0.052627 |  Seems strange to say it, and it seems strange to hear it.
[6709.56 - 6712.56] P:1968.67 E:0.048074 |  Celtic have been beaten by three goals tonight,
[6712.56 - 6715.56] P:1975.17 E:0.048600 |  but it's been a very special night at Celtic Park,
[6715.56 - 6718.56] P:1921.20 E:0.052306 |  and we have watched Real Madrid in action, a very special team.
[6718.56 - 6723.56] P:1964.79 E:0.048026 |  14 times European champions, they've beaten Celtic by three goals to now.
[6723.56 - 6727.56] P:1801.28 E:0.042101 |  James, a clinical performance from Real Madrid.
[6727.56 - 6730.56] P:1738.16 E:0.045163 |  The European champions have come away from...
